00:02:40.589 --> 00:02:40.599 align:start position:0%
Soliloquy at first but um just a few uh
 
00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.040 align:start position:0%
points of background that I'd like to
 
00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:45.080 align:start position:0%
cover uh before we start to get into the
 
00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 align:start position:0%
uh business at hand so we have a mission
 
00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:51.400 align:start position:0%
statement that's been uh reviewed by the
 
00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:55.760 align:start position:0%
minority head there and um and uh I'd
 
00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:57.560 align:start position:0%
like to read that at the direction of
 
00:02:59.149 --> 00:02:59.159 align:start position:0%
the chairman of the election law
 
00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:01.640 align:start position:0%
committee this bipartisan subcommittee
 
00:03:04.949 --> 00:03:04.959 align:start position:0%
is tasked with evaluating consolidating
 
00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280 align:start position:0%
and reconciling various 2025 house bills
 
00:03:10.589 --> 00:03:10.599 align:start position:0%
concerning voter registration and the
 
00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 align:start position:0%
impacts of non-resident voting
 
00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:14.640 align:start position:0%
accordingly the subcommittee will review
 
00:03:17.229 --> 00:03:17.239 align:start position:0%
the proposed legislation with attention
 
00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:18.190 align:start position:0%
the proposed legislation with attention
to

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:18.200 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:03:20.149 --> 00:03:20.159 align:start position:0%
constitutionality any necessary
 
00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:22.440 align:start position:0%
alignment with federal election law and
 
00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:25.200 align:start position:0%
legal preceden the subcommittee will
 
00:03:26.869 --> 00:03:26.879 align:start position:0%
consider historical context and
 
00:03:28.869 --> 00:03:28.879 align:start position:0%
opportunities to clarify current
 
00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:31.280 align:start position:0%
regulations the subcommittee will issue
 
00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:33.200 align:start position:0%
a report to summarize its findings
 
00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:36.120 align:start position:0%
conclusions and
 
00:03:38.949 --> 00:03:38.959 align:start position:0%
recommendations so the subcommittee has
 
00:03:40.309 --> 00:03:40.319 align:start position:0%
been currently tasked with the
 
00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:43.560 align:start position:0%
evaluation of 10 house bills the
 
00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:45.360 align:start position:0%
assigned house bills were listed in the
 
00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:47.920 align:start position:0%
February 12th public notice for the
 
00:03:50.429 --> 00:03:50.439 align:start position:0%

00:04:09.309 --> 00:04:09.319 align:start position:0%
472 618 684 and
 
00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:12.560 align:start position:0%
686 all 10 of these bills have already
 
00:04:14.949 --> 00:04:14.959 align:start position:0%
had a public hearing within the house
 
00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:17.880 align:start position:0%
election law committee and additional
 
00:04:19.749 --> 00:04:19.759 align:start position:0%
bills may be assigned to the
 
00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:22.120 align:start position:0%
subcommittee once they have had a public
 
00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:24.080 align:start position:0%
hearing by the election law
 
00:04:26.189 --> 00:04:26.199 align:start position:0%
committee and if the subcommittee
 
00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:28.240 align:start position:0%
determines that any of the bills under
 
00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:29.800 align:start position:0%
our consideration can be returned
 
00:04:32.749 --> 00:04:32.759 align:start position:0%
returned to the election law committee
 
00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:35.000 align:start position:0%
we will promptly do
 
00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:37.960 align:start position:0%
so with respect to the subcommittee
 
00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:40.080 align:start position:0%
report mentioned in the mission
 
00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:42.400 align:start position:0%
statement that will be due out of the
 
00:04:45.749 --> 00:04:45.759 align:start position:0%
subcommittee on Friday March 14th and
 
00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:47.240 align:start position:0%
that date will likely be the
 
00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:49.440 align:start position:0%
subcommittee's final working
 
00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:52.080 align:start position:0%
session for scheduling purposes I'd like
 
00:04:54.029 --> 00:04:54.039 align:start position:0%
to ask each of the subcommittee members
 
00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:56.560 align:start position:0%
to hold open your Fridays from 9:30 to
 
00:04:59.710 --> 00:04:59.720 align:start position:0%
12:30 for regular working sessions the
 
00:05:01.189 --> 00:05:01.199 align:start position:0%
subcommittee will not be meeting on
 
00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:03.880 align:start position:0%
Friday February 28th uh which is a
 
00:05:05.629 --> 00:05:05.639 align:start position:0%
school vacation week but the
 
00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:07.720 align:start position:0%
subcommittee may have additional working
 
00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:10.400 align:start position:0%
sessions in March so that the report can
 
00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:12.000 align:start position:0%
be ready by its due
 
00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:15.400 align:start position:0%
date um all subcommittee members
 
00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:17.320 align:start position:0%
received two days ago a four-page
 
00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:20.240 align:start position:0%
memorandum from uh Davis Allen our
 
00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:21.800 align:start position:0%
committee researcher thank you very much
 
00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:23.800 align:start position:0%
sir he's sitting in the back of the room
 
00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:25.720 align:start position:0%
um on the definitions of domicile and
 
00:05:28.469 --> 00:05:28.479 align:start position:0%
Resident relative to voting purposes so
 
00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:30.120 align:start position:0%
we thank you for that memo appreciate
 
00:05:33.309 --> 00:05:33.319 align:start position:0%
that good research um no doubt that will
 
00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:35.160 align:start position:0%
come up in our discussions as we go
 
00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:37.440 align:start position:0%
forward and we'll find a way to post
 
00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:41.240 align:start position:0%
that for the public as well um if there
 
00:05:43.309 --> 00:05:43.319 align:start position:0%
is any member of the public who wishes
 
00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:45.440 align:start position:0%
to speak on this topic um the
 
00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:46.800 align:start position:0%
subcommittee would welcome that
 
00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:49.240 align:start position:0%
testimony I would note however that all
 
00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:51.400 align:start position:0%
the sub subcommittee members have
 
00:05:53.749 --> 00:05:53.759 align:start position:0%
attended the election law committee
 
00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:55.600 align:start position:0%
public hearings on the 10 bills under
 
00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:57.120 align:start position:0%
review and therefore the subcommittee
 
00:05:59.670 --> 00:05:59.680 align:start position:0%
does not necessarily need to hear a
 
00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:02.440 align:start position:0%
repeat of any public testimony for
 
00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:05.160 align:start position:0%
specific bills unless there is a
 
00:06:07.589 --> 00:06:07.599 align:start position:0%
specific question that the subcommittee
 
00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:10.440 align:start position:0%
has about that bill or there's some new
 
00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:12.720 align:start position:0%
insight that someone wishes to offer
 
00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:15.440 align:start position:0%
relative to the subcommittee
 
00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:17.520 align:start position:0%
focus so
 
00:06:21.589 --> 00:06:21.599 align:start position:0%
we'll uh just please note that um we've
 
00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:23.440 align:start position:0%
also invited various people to speak to
 
00:06:26.670 --> 00:06:26.680 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee on the topic um the
 
00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:28.800 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State's office uh has been
 
00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:30.800 align:start position:0%
invited they will be speaking at various
 
00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:32.800 align:start position:0%
times as well as the
 
00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:39.120 align:start position:0%
ACLU um so we appreciate that um and as
 
00:06:42.629 --> 00:06:42.639 align:start position:0%
I just a kind of final note um I'm an
 
00:06:44.350 --> 00:06:44.360 align:start position:0%
engineer by degree and as I've been
 
00:06:45.909 --> 00:06:45.919 align:start position:0%
thinking about these different bills and
 
00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:48.120 align:start position:0%
considering them from kind of a process
 
00:06:50.790 --> 00:06:50.800 align:start position:0%
engineering perspective um it seems to
 
00:06:52.830 --> 00:06:52.840 align:start position:0%
me that there's a series of verification
 
00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:55.440 align:start position:0%
events that occur in the voting process
 
00:06:57.110 --> 00:06:57.120 align:start position:0%
for example let's consider the most
 
00:06:59.589 --> 00:06:59.599 align:start position:0%
common voter the pre-registered voter
 
00:07:02.110 --> 00:07:02.120 align:start position:0%
who goes to the polls on Election Day
 
00:07:03.790 --> 00:07:03.800 align:start position:0%
that voter experiences a couple of
 
00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:06.560 align:start position:0%
verification events in the process the
 
00:07:09.350 --> 00:07:09.360 align:start position:0%
event or act of registration before the
 
00:07:11.749 --> 00:07:11.759 align:start position:0%
election day addresses the question is
 
00:07:12.830 --> 00:07:12.840 align:start position:0%
the voter
 
00:07:15.589 --> 00:07:15.599 align:start position:0%
qualified the event or act of checkin on
 
00:07:17.189 --> 00:07:17.199 align:start position:0%
the election day addresses a couple of
 
00:07:19.510 --> 00:07:19.520 align:start position:0%
questions is the voter registered and if
 
00:07:22.270 --> 00:07:22.280 align:start position:0%
so is the identity of the register voter
 
00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:24.720 align:start position:0%
confirmed again I'm using this most
 
00:07:26.790 --> 00:07:26.800 align:start position:0%
common voter example of a pre-register
 
00:07:28.950 --> 00:07:28.960 align:start position:0%
voter who goes to the polls on election
 
00:07:31.469 --> 00:07:31.479 align:start position:0%
days that represents a large major
 
00:07:34.469 --> 00:07:34.479 align:start position:0%
majority of Voters in New Hampshire the
 
00:07:36.309 --> 00:07:36.319 align:start position:0%
voter then receives a ballot in votes
 
00:07:38.710 --> 00:07:38.720 align:start position:0%
and votes are counted in tabulate and uh
 
00:07:40.430 --> 00:07:40.440 align:start position:0%
the review of the voter list by the
 
00:07:42.430 --> 00:07:42.440 align:start position:0%
supervisors of the checklist addresses a
 
00:07:43.909 --> 00:07:43.919 align:start position:0%
couple of the questions is the
 
00:07:46.589 --> 00:07:46.599 align:start position:0%
registered voter still active and is the
 
00:07:48.749 --> 00:07:48.759 align:start position:0%
registered voter still domiciled in this
 
00:07:50.070 --> 00:07:50.080 align:start position:0%
town or city
 
00:07:52.350 --> 00:07:52.360 align:start position:0%
Ward and those are important questions
 
00:07:54.950 --> 00:07:54.960 align:start position:0%
to answer now those are only a couple of
 
00:07:57.270 --> 00:07:57.280 align:start position:0%
illustrations for discussion purposes
 
00:07:59.950 --> 00:07:59.960 align:start position:0%
but is sort of like these verific ation
 
00:08:02.029 --> 00:08:02.039 align:start position:0%
events that are meant to ensure that New
 
00:08:04.230 --> 00:08:04.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire elections are safe and secure
 
00:08:06.390 --> 00:08:06.400 align:start position:0%
and it's important to make sure certain
 
00:08:08.189 --> 00:08:08.199 align:start position:0%
that uh voters go through appropriate
 
00:08:10.070 --> 00:08:10.080 align:start position:0%
verification steps to ensure the
 
00:08:11.790 --> 00:08:11.800 align:start position:0%
elections are safe and secure so that's
 
00:08:13.909 --> 00:08:13.919 align:start position:0%
kind of the foundation that I'd sort of
 
00:08:16.189 --> 00:08:16.199 align:start position:0%
like to lay for this
 
00:08:16.199 --> 00:08:18.390 align:start position:0%
like to lay for this
subcommittee

00:08:18.390 --> 00:08:18.400 align:start position:0%
subcommittee
 
00:08:23.589 --> 00:08:23.599 align:start position:0%
um we have a series of bills here and uh
 
00:08:28.350 --> 00:08:28.360 align:start position:0%
again we'll um kind of muddle our way
 
00:08:33.110 --> 00:08:33.120 align:start position:0%
through these but um there's um there's
 
00:08:36.670 --> 00:08:36.680 align:start position:0%
a number of bills that are are from uh
 
00:08:38.829 --> 00:08:38.839 align:start position:0%
similar sections or identical sections
 
00:08:38.839 --> 00:08:42.670 align:start position:0%
similar sections or identical sections
so

00:08:42.670 --> 00:08:42.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:42.680 --> 00:08:44.350 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:08:44.350 --> 00:08:44.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:08:49.070 --> 00:08:49.080 align:start position:0%
the uh for for example um there
 
00:08:51.190 --> 00:08:51.200 align:start position:0%
are four
 
00:08:56.350 --> 00:08:56.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:01.310 --> 00:09:01.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:03.790 --> 00:09:03.800 align:start position:0%
um which is uh relative to requiring the
 
00:09:05.350 --> 00:09:05.360 align:start position:0%
presentation of a government issued
 
00:09:07.870 --> 00:09:07.880 align:start position:0%
photographic means of identification in
 
00:09:09.110 --> 00:09:09.120 align:start position:0%
order to
 
00:09:11.430 --> 00:09:11.440 align:start position:0%
vote and there
 
00:09:13.790 --> 00:09:13.800 align:start position:0%
is as
 
00:09:17.110 --> 00:09:17.120 align:start position:0%
well uh
 
00:09:20.630 --> 00:09:20.640 align:start position:0%
472 requiring voters to prove
 
00:09:23.310 --> 00:09:23.320 align:start position:0%
domicile which is rsa's
 
00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:24.949 align:start position:0%
domicile which is rsa's
65931

00:09:24.949 --> 00:09:24.959 align:start position:0%
65931
 
00:09:27.030 --> 00:09:27.040 align:start position:0%
C and
 
00:09:30.990 --> 00:09:31.000 align:start position:0%
then 618 and 6
 
00:09:35.870 --> 00:09:35.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:38.310 --> 00:09:38.320 align:start position:0%
65913 and
 
00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:40.110 align:start position:0%
65913 and
so

00:09:40.110 --> 00:09:40.120 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:09:44.069 --> 00:09:44.079 align:start position:0%
uh 618 is Rel enables election officials
 
00:09:46.550 --> 00:09:46.560 align:start position:0%
to verify the single use of an out of
 
00:09:48.389 --> 00:09:48.399 align:start position:0%
outof state driver's license presented
 
00:09:50.710 --> 00:09:50.720 align:start position:0%
when a voter when a person votes by
 
00:09:52.910 --> 00:09:52.920 align:start position:0%
using the centralized voting voter
 
00:09:55.949 --> 00:09:55.959 align:start position:0%
registration database and then 684 is
 
00:09:57.110 --> 00:09:57.120 align:start position:0%
preventing the use of student
 
00:09:59.030 --> 00:09:59.040 align:start position:0%
identification cards as a means to
 
00:10:00.150 --> 00:10:00.160 align:start position:0%
obtain a
 
00:10:05.110 --> 00:10:05.120 align:start position:0%
ballot um and so I think
 
00:10:07.829 --> 00:10:07.839 align:start position:0%
um for the purposes of this committee
 
00:10:11.910 --> 00:10:11.920 align:start position:0%
I'd like to just uh start by looking at
 
00:10:14.150 --> 00:10:14.160 align:start position:0%
those four bills they're relatively
 
00:10:15.590 --> 00:10:15.600 align:start position:0%
short in
 
00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:18.190 align:start position:0%
short in
length

00:10:18.190 --> 00:10:18.200 align:start position:0%
length
 
00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:20.190 align:start position:0%
length
um

00:10:20.190 --> 00:10:20.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:24.750 --> 00:10:24.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:30.670 --> 00:10:30.680 align:start position:0%
65913 yes sir if the if you would HB
 
00:10:34.710 --> 00:10:34.720 align:start position:0%
also pertains to that as well as 317
 
00:10:38.790 --> 00:10:38.800 align:start position:0%
which is not on the on the list
 
00:10:42.310 --> 00:10:42.320 align:start position:0%
so uh thank you representative c
 
00:10:44.910 --> 00:10:44.920 align:start position:0%
um if I
 
00:10:49.190 --> 00:10:49.200 align:start position:0%
read the bill correctly there uh
 
00:10:52.750 --> 00:10:52.760 align:start position:0%
385 so it's interesting they they attack
 
00:10:55.230 --> 00:10:55.240 align:start position:0%
part of this is is our trying to
 
00:10:59.350 --> 00:10:59.360 align:start position:0%
reconcile different parts of the um our
 
00:11:03.430 --> 00:11:03.440 align:start position:0%
RSA and uh 385 that was the one you
 
00:11:06.590 --> 00:11:06.600 align:start position:0%
mentioned right yeah that has I thought
 
00:11:10.670 --> 00:11:10.680 align:start position:0%
I read it correctly maybe I did not um I
 
00:11:14.030 --> 00:11:14.040 align:start position:0%
thought I I wrote down it pertains to
 
00:11:18.829 --> 00:11:18.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:22.629 --> 00:11:22.639 align:start position:0%
wrong no I think part two part two oh
 
00:11:31.509 --> 00:11:31.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:34.790 --> 00:11:34.800 align:start position:0%
oh I should turn this on oh okay so it
 
00:11:36.910 --> 00:11:36.920 align:start position:0%
makes a cross reference
 
00:11:40.829 --> 00:11:40.839 align:start position:0%
right so yeah so anything that
 
00:11:44.430 --> 00:11:44.440 align:start position:0%
1569 last year affected this bill
 
00:11:46.670 --> 00:11:46.680 align:start position:0%
basically is flipping it and putting it
 
00:11:50.870 --> 00:11:50.880 align:start position:0%
back before 1569 so it affects a lot of
 
00:11:54.150 --> 00:11:54.160 align:start position:0%
sections I can go through and since I
 
00:11:56.750 --> 00:11:56.760 align:start position:0%
wrote it since you wrote it well OS
 
00:12:00.509 --> 00:12:00.519 align:start position:0%
wrote it since OS wrote it okay um since
 
00:12:03.629 --> 00:12:03.639 align:start position:0%
I can go through but it does it does
 
00:12:05.590 --> 00:12:05.600 align:start position:0%
affect this one but it affects a lot of
 
00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:07.350 align:start position:0%
affect this one but it affects a lot of
others

00:12:07.350 --> 00:12:07.360 align:start position:0%
others
 
00:12:11.389 --> 00:12:11.399 align:start position:0%
too yes yes there are
 
00:12:15.430 --> 00:12:15.440 align:start position:0%
um I was going to say so going because
 
00:12:17.870 --> 00:12:17.880 align:start position:0%
that's one of the longer bills it's it's
 
00:12:24.310 --> 00:12:24.320 align:start position:0%
19 Pages um I want to uh kind of review
 
00:12:25.629 --> 00:12:25.639 align:start position:0%
that in
 
00:12:29.910 --> 00:12:29.920 align:start position:0%
a uh perhaps future SE
 
00:12:32.069 --> 00:12:32.079 align:start position:0%
if that's okay um just
 
00:12:35.110 --> 00:12:35.120 align:start position:0%
because I I think that would give the
 
00:12:36.629 --> 00:12:36.639 align:start position:0%
subcommittee a little bit more time to
 
00:12:38.269 --> 00:12:38.279 align:start position:0%
prepare I know you're well prepared no
 
00:12:41.310 --> 00:12:41.320 align:start position:0%
doubt as one of the authors um or
 
00:12:45.310 --> 00:12:45.320 align:start position:0%
sponsors but um I think it would be
 
00:12:45.320 --> 00:12:46.430 align:start position:0%
sponsors but um I think it would be
useful

00:12:46.430 --> 00:12:46.440 align:start position:0%
useful
 
00:12:50.310 --> 00:12:50.320 align:start position:0%
to uh perhaps tackle that in a specific
 
00:12:53.350 --> 00:12:53.360 align:start position:0%
subcommittee working session right so um
 
00:12:55.509 --> 00:12:55.519 align:start position:0%
so before that I'll get a list of all
 
00:12:57.470 --> 00:12:57.480 align:start position:0%
the sections yeah that that would be
 
00:13:00.389 --> 00:13:00.399 align:start position:0%
awesome that uh thank you very
 
00:13:05.269 --> 00:13:05.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:11.990 --> 00:13:12.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:35.550 --> 00:13:35.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:38.030 --> 00:13:38.040 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:13:40.790 --> 00:13:40.800 align:start position:0%
so the that bill
 
00:13:45.030 --> 00:13:45.040 align:start position:0%
as um
 
00:13:45.040 --> 00:13:51.189 align:start position:0%
as um
proposed

00:13:51.189 --> 00:13:51.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:55.870 --> 00:13:55.880 align:start position:0%
eliminates it doesn't eliminate but it
 
00:14:00.509 --> 00:14:00.519 align:start position:0%
it rewards some portions of
 
00:14:00.519 --> 00:14:02.230 align:start position:0%
it rewards some portions of
that

00:14:02.230 --> 00:14:02.240 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:14:10.189 --> 00:14:10.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:13.110 --> 00:14:13.120 align:start position:0%
basically so it moves it it actually
 
00:14:15.310 --> 00:14:15.320 align:start position:0%
technically moves the section that
 
00:14:17.269 --> 00:14:17.279 align:start position:0%
discusses outof state driver's license
 
00:14:19.870 --> 00:14:19.880 align:start position:0%
and non-d Driver identification
 
00:14:23.629 --> 00:14:23.639 align:start position:0%
cards uh from that section and then kind
 
00:14:26.710 --> 00:14:26.720 align:start position:0%
of summarizes it
 
00:14:31.069 --> 00:14:31.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:34.710 --> 00:14:34.720 align:start position:0%
Down Below in section 2A under one and
 
00:14:38.030 --> 00:14:38.040 align:start position:0%
two so it basically says a driver's
 
00:14:39.670 --> 00:14:39.680 align:start position:0%
license issued by the state of New
 
00:14:42.030 --> 00:14:42.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire or the federal
 
00:14:45.629 --> 00:14:45.639 align:start position:0%
government the government issued ID and
 
00:14:48.389 --> 00:14:48.399 align:start position:0%
then or an identification card provided
 
00:14:52.069 --> 00:14:52.079 align:start position:0%
under the various rsas listed there to
 
00:14:54.470 --> 00:14:54.480 align:start position:0%
six referencing
 
00:14:57.749 --> 00:14:57.759 align:start position:0%
260 um also United States armed services
 
00:15:00.269 --> 00:15:00.279 align:start position:0%
identification card
 
00:15:00.279 --> 00:15:02.430 align:start position:0%
identification card
passports

00:15:02.430 --> 00:15:02.440 align:start position:0%
passports
 
00:15:04.949 --> 00:15:04.959 align:start position:0%
um and it
 
00:15:08.670 --> 00:15:08.680 align:start position:0%
eliminates other identification
 
00:15:16.430 --> 00:15:16.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:20.470 --> 00:15:20.480 align:start position:0%
issued and it then it makes Provisions
 
00:15:22.790 --> 00:15:22.800 align:start position:0%
for if the person has newly moved to the
 
00:15:26.749 --> 00:15:26.759 align:start position:0%
state in a new section five
 
00:15:31.629 --> 00:15:31.639 align:start position:0%
under 65913 Roman numeral
 
00:15:31.639 --> 00:15:33.230 align:start position:0%
under 65913 Roman numeral
2

00:15:33.230 --> 00:15:33.240 align:start position:0%
2
 
00:15:37.069 --> 00:15:37.079 align:start position:0%
um and makes Provisions for
 
00:15:41.509 --> 00:15:41.519 align:start position:0%
both uh out ofate driver's licenses and
 
00:15:41.519 --> 00:15:43.389 align:start position:0%
both uh out ofate driver's licenses and
nonidentification

00:15:43.389 --> 00:15:43.399 align:start position:0%
nonidentification
 
00:15:46.829 --> 00:15:46.839 align:start position:0%
cards or non driver identification card
 
00:15:46.839 --> 00:15:49.509 align:start position:0%
cards or non driver identification card
sorry

00:15:49.509 --> 00:15:49.519 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
00:15:54.670 --> 00:15:54.680 align:start position:0%
um and then just reorders that so
 
00:15:58.030 --> 00:15:58.040 align:start position:0%
basically it it requires a government
 
00:15:59.629 --> 00:15:59.639 align:start position:0%
issued photograph means of
 
00:16:02.269 --> 00:16:02.279 align:start position:0%
identification in order to
 
00:16:02.279 --> 00:16:04.790 align:start position:0%
identification in order to
vote

00:16:04.790 --> 00:16:04.800 align:start position:0%
vote
 
00:16:08.470 --> 00:16:08.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:11.790 --> 00:16:11.800 align:start position:0%
think that seems
 
00:16:11.800 --> 00:16:13.430 align:start position:0%
think that seems
to

00:16:13.430 --> 00:16:13.440 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:16:16.790 --> 00:16:16.800 align:start position:0%
address the Iden the verification of
 
00:16:19.350 --> 00:16:19.360 align:start position:0%
identity adequately for check-in
 
00:16:31.749 --> 00:16:31.759 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:33.309 --> 00:16:33.319 align:start position:0%
and it would address some of the
 
00:16:35.509 --> 00:16:35.519 align:start position:0%
qualifications perhaps as well but
 
00:16:37.069 --> 00:16:37.079 align:start position:0%
that's that's a
 
00:16:37.079 --> 00:16:39.069 align:start position:0%
that's that's a
different

00:16:39.069 --> 00:16:39.079 align:start position:0%
different
 
00:16:41.910 --> 00:16:41.920 align:start position:0%
um section
 
00:16:44.629 --> 00:16:44.639 align:start position:0%
that or
 
00:16:48.949 --> 00:16:48.959 align:start position:0%
so if we're looking at that
 
00:16:59.230 --> 00:16:59.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:00.870 --> 00:17:00.880 align:start position:0%
equal vote you know treating you know
 
00:17:03.470 --> 00:17:03.480 align:start position:0%
we're not creating a separate class of
 
00:17:06.870 --> 00:17:06.880 align:start position:0%
citizens because we're requiring all or
 
00:17:09.470 --> 00:17:09.480 align:start position:0%
two classes of Voters we're not
 
00:17:09.480 --> 00:17:14.189 align:start position:0%
two classes of Voters we're not
requiring

00:17:14.189 --> 00:17:14.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:17.110 --> 00:17:17.120 align:start position:0%
um we're not creating any subclass by
 
00:17:20.829 --> 00:17:20.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:30.190 --> 00:17:30.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:32.950 --> 00:17:32.960 align:start position:0%
we're it doesn't appear that we would be
 
00:17:34.710 --> 00:17:34.720 align:start position:0%
because we're requiring it from all
 
00:17:37.310 --> 00:17:37.320 align:start position:0%
voters we're making Provisions for those
 
00:17:38.630 --> 00:17:38.640 align:start position:0%
who don't
 
00:17:42.950 --> 00:17:42.960 align:start position:0%
have a driver's license or a non-driver
 
00:17:44.190 --> 00:17:44.200 align:start position:0%
and you
 
00:17:46.190 --> 00:17:46.200 align:start position:0%
know through the non-driver
 
00:17:51.669 --> 00:17:51.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:55.070 --> 00:17:55.080 align:start position:0%
we're making um and then for those who
 
00:17:58.909 --> 00:17:58.919 align:start position:0%
do have driver's licenses we're
 
00:18:00.830 --> 00:18:00.840 align:start position:0%
addressing that
 
00:18:00.840 --> 00:18:02.789 align:start position:0%
addressing that
through

00:18:02.789 --> 00:18:02.799 align:start position:0%
through
 
00:18:05.590 --> 00:18:05.600 align:start position:0%
the aspects
 
00:18:08.870 --> 00:18:08.880 align:start position:0%
of either a New Hampshire one or an
 
00:18:10.909 --> 00:18:10.919 align:start position:0%
outof State one is also permitted under
 
00:18:10.919 --> 00:18:14.510 align:start position:0%
outof State one is also permitted under
certain

00:18:14.510 --> 00:18:14.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:19.710 --> 00:18:19.720 align:start position:0%
conditions so as we as we
 
00:18:22.590 --> 00:18:22.600 align:start position:0%
look to this
 
00:18:26.950 --> 00:18:26.960 align:start position:0%
particular one is there anything that
 
00:18:30.870 --> 00:18:30.880 align:start position:0%
we um you know have have a con do we
 
00:18:34.590 --> 00:18:34.600 align:start position:0%
feel that this would adversely impact
 
00:18:37.750 --> 00:18:37.760 align:start position:0%
voter registration or that it would
 
00:18:40.669 --> 00:18:40.679 align:start position:0%
somehow inhibit non-resident voting at
 
00:18:40.679 --> 00:18:42.710 align:start position:0%
somehow inhibit non-resident voting at
this

00:18:42.710 --> 00:18:42.720 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:18:46.630 --> 00:18:46.640 align:start position:0%
point um yes yes representative Lane
 
00:18:49.630 --> 00:18:49.640 align:start position:0%
what what the simple answer is yes it
 
00:18:54.390 --> 00:18:54.400 align:start position:0%
does impact it tremendously um and it's
 
00:18:58.430 --> 00:18:58.440 align:start position:0%
clearly targeted I think at students and
 
00:19:01.149 --> 00:19:01.159 align:start position:0%
um there's been there was no offer of
 
00:19:03.390 --> 00:19:03.400 align:start position:0%
any proof of any fraud or anything by
 
00:19:06.590 --> 00:19:06.600 align:start position:0%
any students in in when it was presented
 
00:19:09.909 --> 00:19:09.919 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:19:13.669 --> 00:19:13.679 align:start position:0%
it it and I guess one of the questions I
 
00:19:16.110 --> 00:19:16.120 align:start position:0%
had was my understanding at least from
 
00:19:19.310 --> 00:19:19.320 align:start position:0%
some of the testimony was that the UNH
 
00:19:23.990 --> 00:19:24.000 align:start position:0%
card May well be a governmen issued
 
00:19:26.750 --> 00:19:26.760 align:start position:0%
ID and I guess that was one question I
 
00:19:29.750 --> 00:19:29.760 align:start position:0%
had um because during the testim Tony I
 
00:19:32.149 --> 00:19:32.159 align:start position:0%
think it got raised I can't remember who
 
00:19:34.870 --> 00:19:34.880 align:start position:0%
raised it but it it may well be a
 
00:19:37.830 --> 00:19:37.840 align:start position:0%
governmen issued ID because UNH is part
 
00:19:41.149 --> 00:19:41.159 align:start position:0%
of the state government and I I thought
 
00:19:46.710 --> 00:19:46.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:46.720 --> 00:19:49.669 align:start position:0%
 
that

00:19:49.669 --> 00:19:49.679 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:19:53.590 --> 00:19:53.600 align:start position:0%
okay uh I'd like to yes respond to that
 
00:19:56.750 --> 00:19:56.760 align:start position:0%
I believe I believe um the question on
 
00:20:00.669 --> 00:20:00.679 align:start position:0%
the um student ID was that they did not
 
00:20:04.350 --> 00:20:04.360 align:start position:0%
have an address of their physical D of
 
00:20:06.350 --> 00:20:06.360 align:start position:0%
their location where they live I think
 
00:20:09.510 --> 00:20:09.520 align:start position:0%
it was just like a generic UNH
 
00:20:12.549 --> 00:20:12.559 align:start position:0%
address I think that's what was brought
 
00:20:16.350 --> 00:20:16.360 align:start position:0%
up so it's not really
 
00:20:20.149 --> 00:20:20.159 align:start position:0%
telling on the ID as to their exact
 
00:20:23.270 --> 00:20:23.280 align:start position:0%
living location so it it doesn't
 
00:20:26.149 --> 00:20:26.159 align:start position:0%
identify the doile it has just like a
 
00:20:28.350 --> 00:20:28.360 align:start position:0%
UNH and I think they may have even said
 
00:20:32.990 --> 00:20:33.000 align:start position:0%
a possibly a PO box so I recall that I
 
00:20:35.669 --> 00:20:35.679 align:start position:0%
think what they I'm sorry do we want to
 
00:20:36.990 --> 00:20:37.000 align:start position:0%
just Converse or do you have to
 
00:20:40.470 --> 00:20:40.480 align:start position:0%
recognize this I don't um why don't we
 
00:20:44.110 --> 00:20:44.120 align:start position:0%
converse for the for the moment if if if
 
00:20:47.510 --> 00:20:47.520 align:start position:0%
I am if I I do have a gavel here and I
 
00:20:50.029 --> 00:20:50.039 align:start position:0%
will enforce it if if necessary I think
 
00:20:52.750 --> 00:20:52.760 align:start position:0%
it it's good to have the discussion um
 
00:20:55.830 --> 00:20:55.840 align:start position:0%
so let's let's um yeah just you know
 
00:20:57.430 --> 00:20:57.440 align:start position:0%
that's what we did last year when we did
 
00:21:00.190 --> 00:21:00.200 align:start position:0%
the campaign Finance one one and Jim was
 
00:21:02.470 --> 00:21:02.480 align:start position:0%
I don't think Jim qua ever had to gabble
 
00:21:05.710 --> 00:21:05.720 align:start position:0%
anybody so hopefully we'll um we'll find
 
00:21:07.870 --> 00:21:07.880 align:start position:0%
out yes you're right on the PO Boxes but
 
00:21:10.110 --> 00:21:10.120 align:start position:0%
my recollection was that that was for
 
00:21:13.029 --> 00:21:13.039 align:start position:0%
the people who were living on campus and
 
00:21:15.149 --> 00:21:15.159 align:start position:0%
that they came to a PO box if you lived
 
00:21:18.430 --> 00:21:18.440 align:start position:0%
on campus they all got assigned a PO box
 
00:21:22.029 --> 00:21:22.039 align:start position:0%
and that's so if you have a PO Box on it
 
00:21:25.710 --> 00:21:25.720 align:start position:0%
you live on campus and if you don't then
 
00:21:27.510 --> 00:21:27.520 align:start position:0%
it's not going to I don't think it has
 
00:21:29.909 --> 00:21:29.919 align:start position:0%
an address but this is just for identity
 
00:21:33.430 --> 00:21:33.440 align:start position:0%
purposes not for domicile purposes so as
 
00:21:36.909 --> 00:21:36.919 align:start position:0%
long as has the picture and the name I
 
00:21:39.789 --> 00:21:39.799 align:start position:0%
isn't this just for
 
00:21:44.029 --> 00:21:44.039 align:start position:0%
identity so if a person
 
00:21:46.510 --> 00:21:46.520 align:start position:0%
is is
 
00:21:48.870 --> 00:21:48.880 align:start position:0%
pre-registered where the residency or
 
00:21:52.029 --> 00:21:52.039 align:start position:0%
domicile has been already identified
 
00:21:54.230 --> 00:21:54.240 align:start position:0%
that would be valid same day
 
00:21:56.310 --> 00:21:56.320 align:start position:0%
registration I think that that creates
 
00:21:58.029 --> 00:21:58.039 align:start position:0%
tremendous problems because you don't
 
00:21:59.269 --> 00:21:59.279 align:start position:0%
really have
 
00:22:00.830 --> 00:22:00.840 align:start position:0%
unless they're providing other evidence
 
00:22:04.269 --> 00:22:04.279 align:start position:0%
of their doile address that's that can
 
00:22:04.279 --> 00:22:05.269 align:start position:0%
of their doile address that's that can
be

00:22:05.269 --> 00:22:05.279 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:22:09.350 --> 00:22:09.360 align:start position:0%
substantiated um and I I do think the
 
00:22:14.549 --> 00:22:14.559 align:start position:0%
the PO Box um as an address under any
 
00:22:18.750 --> 00:22:18.760 align:start position:0%
circumstances has some
 
00:22:18.760 --> 00:22:20.669 align:start position:0%
circumstances has some
um

00:22:20.669 --> 00:22:20.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:22:24.029 --> 00:22:24.039 align:start position:0%
uh issues again just relating to how how
 
00:22:27.870 --> 00:22:27.880 align:start position:0%
can you check and verify that that this
 
00:22:29.990 --> 00:22:30.000 align:start position:0%
a legitimate residence or
 
00:22:34.909 --> 00:22:34.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:38.950 --> 00:22:38.960 align:start position:0%
um so um the chair would like to
 
00:22:41.510 --> 00:22:41.520 align:start position:0%
recognize one of our members and forgive
 
00:22:43.590 --> 00:22:43.600 align:start position:0%
me I don't have your name memorized but
 
00:22:46.310 --> 00:22:46.320 align:start position:0%
but please um please introduce yourself
 
00:22:48.870 --> 00:22:48.880 align:start position:0%
and um thank you for uh coming up and
 
00:22:50.549 --> 00:22:50.559 align:start position:0%
speaking yes thank you very much uh my
 
00:22:52.590 --> 00:22:52.600 align:start position:0%
name is Michael O'Brien I um am a
 
00:22:53.830 --> 00:22:53.840 align:start position:0%
lobbyist at pretty strategies and
 
00:22:56.909 --> 00:22:56.919 align:start position:0%
represent America votes just wanted to
 
00:22:59.909 --> 00:22:59.919 align:start position:0%
sort of echo representative l Point here
 
00:23:03.590 --> 00:23:03.600 align:start position:0%
so IDs are used to prove identity so for
 
00:23:05.269 --> 00:23:05.279 align:start position:0%
instance a passport which is a
 
00:23:07.750 --> 00:23:07.760 align:start position:0%
government ID I could bring to the polls
 
00:23:09.549 --> 00:23:09.559 align:start position:0%
to prove who I am but it will not have
 
00:23:12.630 --> 00:23:12.640 align:start position:0%
my address on it right but that does not
 
00:23:15.830 --> 00:23:15.840 align:start position:0%
stop me from producing a passport and
 
00:23:17.630 --> 00:23:17.640 align:start position:0%
you saying y this is who he is it has
 
00:23:19.870 --> 00:23:19.880 align:start position:0%
his picture it has his name it is an
 
00:23:21.630 --> 00:23:21.640 align:start position:0%
official ID and therefore proves
 
00:23:23.750 --> 00:23:23.760 align:start position:0%
identity I would then have to produce
 
00:23:26.750 --> 00:23:26.760 align:start position:0%
something else beyond my passport so I
 
00:23:29.149 --> 00:23:29.159 align:start position:0%
just want to make sure we're not sort of
 
00:23:32.029 --> 00:23:32.039 align:start position:0%
convoluting uh the the purpose a New
 
00:23:33.909 --> 00:23:33.919 align:start position:0%
Hampshire license could prove both right
 
00:23:36.269 --> 00:23:36.279 align:start position:0%
it could prove both your identity and
 
00:23:38.950 --> 00:23:38.960 align:start position:0%
your domicile if your address is correct
 
00:23:41.710 --> 00:23:41.720 align:start position:0%
on your license uh we heard testimony
 
00:23:43.990 --> 00:23:44.000 align:start position:0%
just this past week when you go to the
 
00:23:45.830 --> 00:23:45.840 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire DMV and you go to update
 
00:23:48.029 --> 00:23:48.039 align:start position:0%
your address what they say to you is you
 
00:23:50.110 --> 00:23:50.120 align:start position:0%
can spend 50 bucks if you want right now
 
00:23:52.310 --> 00:23:52.320 align:start position:0%
or you don't have to and you can just
 
00:23:54.350 --> 00:23:54.360 align:start position:0%
keep your license as is and so lots of
 
00:23:57.310 --> 00:23:57.320 align:start position:0%
folks have a license that is not with
 
00:23:59.310 --> 00:23:59.320 align:start position:0%
their current address but they are up to
 
00:24:01.549 --> 00:24:01.559 align:start position:0%
like they are completely within the law
 
00:24:02.750 --> 00:24:02.760 align:start position:0%
they have done what they are supposed to
 
00:24:05.870 --> 00:24:05.880 align:start position:0%
do and so when we're talking about ID I
 
00:24:07.830 --> 00:24:07.840 align:start position:0%
just want to make sure that we're clear
 
00:24:10.870 --> 00:24:10.880 align:start position:0%
that that is to prove identity it can be
 
00:24:12.789 --> 00:24:12.799 align:start position:0%
used to prove domicile but it does not
 
00:24:15.230 --> 00:24:15.240 align:start position:0%
have to be used to prove it um and in
 
00:24:17.390 --> 00:24:17.400 align:start position:0%
many cases like I said with a passport
 
00:24:19.350 --> 00:24:19.360 align:start position:0%
or something else it might not and
 
00:24:22.630 --> 00:24:22.640 align:start position:0%
that's okay um I think as long as again
 
00:24:24.390 --> 00:24:24.400 align:start position:0%
there is a secondary document that must
 
00:24:26.789 --> 00:24:26.799 align:start position:0%
now be shown to prove it and I just want
 
00:24:27.870 --> 00:24:27.880 align:start position:0%
to be clear about that for this
 
00:24:29.830 --> 00:24:29.840 align:start position:0%
committee that we dealing with two very
 
00:24:32.990 --> 00:24:33.000 align:start position:0%
separate things that these IDs
 
00:24:35.590 --> 00:24:35.600 align:start position:0%
prove uh thank you very much Mr o'r are
 
00:24:37.350 --> 00:24:37.360 align:start position:0%
you willing to take some questions sure
 
00:24:41.389 --> 00:24:41.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:46.669 --> 00:24:46.679 align:start position:0%
um so to to your point though is
 
00:24:49.510 --> 00:24:49.520 align:start position:0%
if there's a there's a registration
 
00:24:50.710 --> 00:24:50.720 align:start position:0%
process during which different
 
00:24:53.230 --> 00:24:53.240 align:start position:0%
qualifications must be addressed and
 
00:24:55.990 --> 00:24:56.000 align:start position:0%
then there's the identity process for
 
00:24:58.470 --> 00:24:58.480 align:start position:0%
checking in and receiving a ballot and
 
00:25:02.070 --> 00:25:02.080 align:start position:0%
and and I agree that is that a governmen
 
00:25:06.430 --> 00:25:06.440 align:start position:0%
issued ID that like a passport that does
 
00:25:08.750 --> 00:25:08.760 align:start position:0%
uh verify
 
00:25:12.870 --> 00:25:12.880 align:start position:0%
your uh identity would be suitable for a
 
00:25:15.549 --> 00:25:15.559 align:start position:0%
pre-registered voter um and they
 
00:25:17.510 --> 00:25:17.520 align:start position:0%
wouldn't and they would not have to in
 
00:25:18.990 --> 00:25:19.000 align:start position:0%
that would you agree that in those
 
00:25:20.870 --> 00:25:20.880 align:start position:0%
circumstances they would not have to
 
00:25:24.789 --> 00:25:24.799 align:start position:0%
produce anything to prove their docility
 
00:25:27.470 --> 00:25:27.480 align:start position:0%
unless they had changed recently so if
 
00:25:29.990 --> 00:25:30.000 align:start position:0%
I'm a registered voter and I I show up
 
00:25:33.389 --> 00:25:33.399 align:start position:0%
um to the polls to go vote and I'm I'm
 
00:25:35.510 --> 00:25:35.520 align:start position:0%
already registered right so I show up I
 
00:25:38.230 --> 00:25:38.240 align:start position:0%
you know what the law dictates right now
 
00:25:39.510 --> 00:25:39.520 align:start position:0%
is that you prove identity they
 
00:25:41.710 --> 00:25:41.720 align:start position:0%
certainly do read your address to you
 
00:25:43.110 --> 00:25:43.120 align:start position:0%
right they we've all you go to the
 
00:25:45.430 --> 00:25:45.440 align:start position:0%
checklist they say I say three Rockwood
 
00:25:47.350 --> 00:25:47.360 align:start position:0%
terrorists I don't know if I should say
 
00:25:51.110 --> 00:25:51.120 align:start position:0%
out loud but anyway uh and they uh and
 
00:25:53.110 --> 00:25:53.120 align:start position:0%
they and then you know I get my ballot
 
00:25:55.110 --> 00:25:55.120 align:start position:0%
but there is no as as discussed in the
 
00:25:56.789 --> 00:25:56.799 align:start position:0%
previous bill right so you're there to
 
00:25:58.789 --> 00:25:58.799 align:start position:0%
prove identity and so the ID works for
 
00:26:01.630 --> 00:26:01.640 align:start position:0%
that purpose which is which is the
 
00:26:03.310 --> 00:26:03.320 align:start position:0%
purpose of of what the law reflects
 
00:26:03.320 --> 00:26:06.029 align:start position:0%
purpose of of what the law reflects
right

00:26:06.029 --> 00:26:06.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:10.430 --> 00:26:10.440 align:start position:0%
now and then uh for but for those people
 
00:26:14.789 --> 00:26:14.799 align:start position:0%
who are registering same day voting sure
 
00:26:17.669 --> 00:26:17.679 align:start position:0%
um they're going to at Le to
 
00:26:20.870 --> 00:26:20.880 align:start position:0%
require um something to prove their
 
00:26:24.590 --> 00:26:24.600 align:start position:0%
identity yep and then if they don't
 
00:26:28.430 --> 00:26:28.440 align:start position:0%
have an address on that identification
 
00:26:31.430 --> 00:26:31.440 align:start position:0%
they need something to prove their doile
 
00:26:33.029 --> 00:26:33.039 align:start position:0%
Y and then if there are any other
 
00:26:36.190 --> 00:26:36.200 align:start position:0%
qualifications pertaining to the right
 
00:26:38.710 --> 00:26:38.720 align:start position:0%
to vote then sure yeah they would need
 
00:26:42.110 --> 00:26:42.120 align:start position:0%
to prove citizenship they would Age um
 
00:26:43.710 --> 00:26:43.720 align:start position:0%
you know all those things would would
 
00:26:47.029 --> 00:26:47.039 align:start position:0%
have to be proved somehow um but again
 
00:26:48.909 --> 00:26:48.919 align:start position:0%
an ID can prove multiple of those things
 
00:26:50.070 --> 00:26:50.080 align:start position:0%
right as a New Hampshire license can
 
00:26:52.789 --> 00:26:52.799 align:start position:0%
prove your age it can prove your uh doy
 
00:26:53.990 --> 00:26:54.000 align:start position:0%
that can prove your identity it cannot
 
00:26:55.310 --> 00:26:55.320 align:start position:0%
prove your citizenship as we've talked
 
00:26:57.110 --> 00:26:57.120 align:start position:0%
about right and real IDs do not prove
 
00:26:59.590 --> 00:26:59.600 align:start position:0%
citizenship um um but it could prove
 
00:27:01.430 --> 00:27:01.440 align:start position:0%
three of the four and then you'd be you
 
00:27:02.750 --> 00:27:02.760 align:start position:0%
have to produce the last document they
 
00:27:04.789 --> 00:27:04.799 align:start position:0%
can but not always right and this goes
 
00:27:06.549 --> 00:27:06.559 align:start position:0%
back to that it's not always going to do
 
00:27:10.549 --> 00:27:10.559 align:start position:0%
that um so it is now accomp upon the
 
00:27:13.630 --> 00:27:13.640 align:start position:0%
voter to make sure that they have all of
 
00:27:18.110 --> 00:27:18.120 align:start position:0%
those documents um ready to produce for
 
00:27:21.510 --> 00:27:21.520 align:start position:0%
the um for the supervisor checklist so
 
00:27:22.789 --> 00:27:22.799 align:start position:0%
that they can be
 
00:27:27.070 --> 00:27:27.080 align:start position:0%
registered um and that's again an ID a
 
00:27:29.630 --> 00:27:29.640 align:start position:0%
college ID would prove one thing um and
 
00:27:31.789 --> 00:27:31.799 align:start position:0%
we know that colleges work to you know
 
00:27:33.389 --> 00:27:33.399 align:start position:0%
to help make sure students have all the
 
00:27:35.389 --> 00:27:35.399 align:start position:0%
appropriate information but their ID
 
00:27:38.110 --> 00:27:38.120 align:start position:0%
would just prove who they are and that's
 
00:27:39.310 --> 00:27:39.320 align:start position:0%
that's the end of it and they have to
 
00:27:41.389 --> 00:27:41.399 align:start position:0%
produce the rest of these in order to
 
00:27:44.669 --> 00:27:44.679 align:start position:0%
qualify to vote okay thank you
 
00:27:47.470 --> 00:27:47.480 align:start position:0%
yep does the subcommittee have any other
 
00:27:51.430 --> 00:27:51.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:55.710 --> 00:27:55.720 align:start position:0%
time maybe later yep sure yeah of course
 
00:27:58.710 --> 00:27:58.720 align:start position:0%
and I know this might sound silly but
 
00:28:01.470 --> 00:28:01.480 align:start position:0%
so when students provide their ID are
 
00:28:04.230 --> 00:28:04.240 align:start position:0%
they showing a different uh another form
 
00:28:06.909 --> 00:28:06.919 align:start position:0%
of their demile yeah I believe they have
 
00:28:09.950 --> 00:28:09.960 align:start position:0%
to they would 100% uh un I believe has a
 
00:28:11.909 --> 00:28:11.919 align:start position:0%
list of like where the kids live so that
 
00:28:13.430 --> 00:28:13.440 align:start position:0%
they can cross check to make sure that
 
00:28:15.590 --> 00:28:15.600 align:start position:0%
they're the right spot um oftentimes
 
00:28:17.750 --> 00:28:17.760 align:start position:0%
they have a letter right with like this
 
00:28:19.509 --> 00:28:19.519 align:start position:0%
is your dorm this is the address of your
 
00:28:21.070 --> 00:28:21.080 align:start position:0%
dorm I believe they have to produce that
 
00:28:22.549 --> 00:28:22.559 align:start position:0%
in order to prove that they live on
 
00:28:24.830 --> 00:28:24.840 align:start position:0%
campus or as rep representative Lane
 
00:28:27.389 --> 00:28:27.399 align:start position:0%
said if they live off campus right then
 
00:28:28.830 --> 00:28:28.840 align:start position:0%
they would have to either either have a
 
00:28:30.110 --> 00:28:30.120 align:start position:0%
license with that on it or produce a
 
00:28:32.430 --> 00:28:32.440 align:start position:0%
lease or something to prove that they
 
00:28:33.789 --> 00:28:33.799 align:start position:0%
are domiciled in New Hampshire they
 
00:28:36.789 --> 00:28:36.799 align:start position:0%
cannot just produce their unid would not
 
00:28:38.230 --> 00:28:38.240 align:start position:0%
be enough to
 
00:28:42.269 --> 00:28:42.279 align:start position:0%
verify uh domicile for students and is
 
00:28:44.750 --> 00:28:44.760 align:start position:0%
this the same for freshmen that are just
 
00:28:47.950 --> 00:28:47.960 align:start position:0%
moving to New Hampshire and you know
 
00:28:50.310 --> 00:28:50.320 align:start position:0%
within the couple months they can vote
 
00:28:52.549 --> 00:28:52.559 align:start position:0%
based off of that information y so
 
00:28:53.710 --> 00:28:53.720 align:start position:0%
they'd have to produce again their
 
00:28:54.909 --> 00:28:54.919 align:start position:0%
student idea would prove who they are
 
00:28:56.029 --> 00:28:56.039 align:start position:0%
and then they would need to produce
 
00:28:58.590 --> 00:28:58.600 align:start position:0%
something that proves that they live um
 
00:29:00.990 --> 00:29:01.000 align:start position:0%
you know in whatever dorm we live in or
 
00:29:03.350 --> 00:29:03.360 align:start position:0%
again whatever apartment they're renting
 
00:29:04.590 --> 00:29:04.600 align:start position:0%
whatever the case may be for that
 
00:29:07.070 --> 00:29:07.080 align:start position:0%
particular student okay thank you and I
 
00:29:08.110 --> 00:29:08.120 align:start position:0%
want to stress too it's not just
 
00:29:09.350 --> 00:29:09.360 align:start position:0%
students that we're talking about here
 
00:29:11.070 --> 00:29:11.080 align:start position:0%
right so you know let's say you work for
 
00:29:13.269 --> 00:29:13.279 align:start position:0%
biee and you have a a badge and you know
 
00:29:14.750 --> 00:29:14.760 align:start position:0%
maybe you forget your license at home
 
00:29:15.990 --> 00:29:16.000 align:start position:0%
but you have your work badge because you
 
00:29:17.310 --> 00:29:17.320 align:start position:0%
need to do you're going to work right
 
00:29:19.870 --> 00:29:19.880 align:start position:0%
after right like we trust Bae I think as
 
00:29:22.230 --> 00:29:22.240 align:start position:0%
a like a a pretty large employer in the
 
00:29:25.750 --> 00:29:25.760 align:start position:0%
state to produce a badge that is and and
 
00:29:27.430 --> 00:29:27.440 align:start position:0%
that's ultimately the way the law is
 
00:29:30.149 --> 00:29:30.159 align:start position:0%
written right now under 1569 and
 
00:29:31.830 --> 00:29:31.840 align:start position:0%
certainly the deputy secretary can
 
00:29:33.549 --> 00:29:33.559 align:start position:0%
correct me if I'm wrong here but it's up
 
00:29:35.110 --> 00:29:35.120 align:start position:0%
to the discretion of the moderator right
 
00:29:37.190 --> 00:29:37.200 align:start position:0%
to say yes this is good enough or no
 
00:29:38.789 --> 00:29:38.799 align:start position:0%
it's not good enough and we've sort of
 
00:29:41.389 --> 00:29:41.399 align:start position:0%
said like we left it open a little bit
 
00:29:43.389 --> 00:29:43.399 align:start position:0%
more under 1569 than we had under
 
00:29:49.830 --> 00:29:49.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:54.909 --> 00:29:54.919 align:start position:0%
so and um when you're talking about the
 
00:29:56.630 --> 00:29:56.640 align:start position:0%
proving residence domicile all that
 
00:29:58.669 --> 00:29:58.679 align:start position:0%
stuff sure that occurs to check
 
00:30:01.470 --> 00:30:01.480 align:start position:0%
qualification at registration correct as
 
00:30:05.230 --> 00:30:05.240 align:start position:0%
opposed to under
 
00:30:08.830 --> 00:30:08.840 align:start position:0%
65913 obtaining a ballot correct which
 
00:30:10.870 --> 00:30:10.880 align:start position:0%
is what I thought we were talking about
 
00:30:12.110 --> 00:30:12.120 align:start position:0%
with RSA
 
00:30:16.909 --> 00:30:16.919 align:start position:0%
323 is at when going at the polls
 
00:30:19.990 --> 00:30:20.000 align:start position:0%
to um get the ballot correct correct
 
00:30:22.630 --> 00:30:22.640 align:start position:0%
correct so right so there's no uh
 
00:30:26.110 --> 00:30:26.120 align:start position:0%
currently there's no reason to prove
 
00:30:29.029 --> 00:30:29.039 align:start position:0%
domicile residency to obtain the ballot
 
00:30:31.750 --> 00:30:31.760 align:start position:0%
correct correct that's exactly right um
 
00:30:34.669 --> 00:30:34.679 align:start position:0%
and so this is right about during the
 
00:30:35.750 --> 00:30:35.760 align:start position:0%
registration process is what we're
 
00:30:36.830 --> 00:30:36.840 align:start position:0%
talking so all that stuff's already
 
00:30:38.830 --> 00:30:38.840 align:start position:0%
happened when you registered correct and
 
00:30:40.310 --> 00:30:40.320 align:start position:0%
even same day
 
00:30:42.950 --> 00:30:42.960 align:start position:0%
registrants go to a different line
 
00:30:45.389 --> 00:30:45.399 align:start position:0%
correct to to make sure all that flies
 
00:30:47.950 --> 00:30:47.960 align:start position:0%
before getting the the the obtaining a
 
00:30:51.950 --> 00:30:51.960 align:start position:0%
ballot is a separate time and what is
 
00:30:53.430 --> 00:30:53.440 align:start position:0%
needs to be proven hopefully not too
 
00:30:54.950 --> 00:30:54.960 align:start position:0%
much time but unfortunately this year we
 
00:30:56.669 --> 00:30:56.679 align:start position:0%
did see some uh some pretty long lines
 
00:30:58.549 --> 00:30:58.559 align:start position:0%
so um but yes
 
00:31:00.269 --> 00:31:00.279 align:start position:0%
you do you you have to register first
 
00:31:01.629 --> 00:31:01.639 align:start position:0%
and then obviously get your ballot uh
 
00:31:08.950 --> 00:31:08.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:12.509 --> 00:31:12.519 align:start position:0%
complete I would just I'm sorry no
 
00:31:15.190 --> 00:31:15.200 align:start position:0%
go I just want to remind everybody that
 
00:31:17.750 --> 00:31:17.760 align:start position:0%
we have a letter from both the clerk and
 
00:31:20.549 --> 00:31:20.559 align:start position:0%
the moderator from Handover that's
 
00:31:23.149 --> 00:31:23.159 align:start position:0%
really extensive that's that was
 
00:31:26.269 --> 00:31:26.279 align:start position:0%
presented as testimony um that talks
 
00:31:30.070 --> 00:31:30.080 align:start position:0%
about what they accept in Handover and
 
00:31:32.149 --> 00:31:32.159 align:start position:0%
she mentioned several different like
 
00:31:35.629 --> 00:31:35.639 align:start position:0%
really large employers that have um
 
00:31:39.269 --> 00:31:39.279 align:start position:0%
different uh they take that ID and these
 
00:31:41.389 --> 00:31:41.399 align:start position:0%
are for people just for the ID you know
 
00:31:44.350 --> 00:31:44.360 align:start position:0%
to show that who they are and so um I
 
00:31:46.830 --> 00:31:46.840 align:start position:0%
think I can't remember the names of the
 
00:31:48.870 --> 00:31:48.880 align:start position:0%
companies but they're pretty big
 
00:31:51.110 --> 00:31:51.120 align:start position:0%
employers and and I think they take like
 
00:31:53.669 --> 00:31:53.679 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth hospital they take those as
 
00:31:57.669 --> 00:31:57.679 align:start position:0%
IDs and huh hyperm yeah hyperm that was
 
00:32:00.870 --> 00:32:00.880 align:start position:0%
one I couldn't remember and um so I just
 
00:32:02.549 --> 00:32:02.559 align:start position:0%
want to remind everybody that that's in
 
00:32:05.909 --> 00:32:05.919 align:start position:0%
there about what that moderator does and
 
00:32:07.509 --> 00:32:07.519 align:start position:0%
uh and what that clerk does and what
 
00:32:09.110 --> 00:32:09.120 align:start position:0%
they've worked out with the Dartmouth
 
00:32:11.870 --> 00:32:11.880 align:start position:0%
students as well um and they do have
 
00:32:14.590 --> 00:32:14.600 align:start position:0%
lists of who lives where on campus and
 
00:32:16.269 --> 00:32:16.279 align:start position:0%
they provide that and the clerk I think
 
00:32:18.870 --> 00:32:18.880 align:start position:0%
the clerk's office has that list when
 
00:32:21.430 --> 00:32:21.440 align:start position:0%
when they're there so they are aware
 
00:32:23.190 --> 00:32:23.200 align:start position:0%
from from a domicile standpoint if they
 
00:32:26.149 --> 00:32:26.159 align:start position:0%
ever wanted to ask but um and they've
 
00:32:27.990 --> 00:32:28.000 align:start position:0%
come up and I think the folks in Durham
 
00:32:29.950 --> 00:32:29.960 align:start position:0%
do the same thing not so much maybe with
 
00:32:32.310 --> 00:32:32.320 align:start position:0%
employers but I know for the students
 
00:32:33.870 --> 00:32:33.880 align:start position:0%
they do because I used to have to
 
00:32:37.070 --> 00:32:37.080 align:start position:0%
observe um over in durum and uh and
 
00:32:45.389 --> 00:32:45.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:47.629 --> 00:32:47.639 align:start position:0%
yeah subcommittee have any other
 
00:32:49.389 --> 00:32:49.399 align:start position:0%
questions at this
 
00:33:00.190 --> 00:33:00.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:02.110 --> 00:33:02.120 align:start position:0%
all right so
 
00:33:06.549 --> 00:33:06.559 align:start position:0%
um we've sort of looked at that
 
00:33:10.990 --> 00:33:11.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:18.310 --> 00:33:18.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:22.629 --> 00:33:22.639 align:start position:0%
at um one of the other bills that is
 
00:33:24.870 --> 00:33:24.880 align:start position:0%
applicable to
 
00:33:28.629 --> 00:33:28.639 align:start position:0%
65913 again recognizing that yes all of
 
00:33:31.669 --> 00:33:31.679 align:start position:0%
these intersect at some point or another
 
00:33:39.669 --> 00:33:39.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:39.679 --> 00:33:50.389 align:start position:0%
 
472

00:33:50.389 --> 00:33:50.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:55.549 --> 00:33:55.559 align:start position:0%
um all right this is again another
 
00:34:01.470 --> 00:34:01.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:01.480 --> 00:34:04.430 align:start position:0%
 
bill

00:34:04.430 --> 00:34:04.440 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:34:11.750 --> 00:34:11.760 align:start position:0%
um it repeals 6591 131 Roman numeral 1
 
00:34:16.829 --> 00:34:16.839 align:start position:0%
C and um provides that if the voter does
 
00:34:20.470 --> 00:34:20.480 align:start position:0%
not have proof of res residency or
 
00:34:23.589 --> 00:34:23.599 align:start position:0%
domicile um and then list you utility
 
00:34:26.149 --> 00:34:26.159 align:start position:0%
bill lease deed similar documentation of
 
00:34:28.669 --> 00:34:28.679 align:start position:0%
the voters dool address the ballot clerk
 
00:34:30.750 --> 00:34:30.760 align:start position:0%
shall direct the voter to see the
 
00:34:32.909 --> 00:34:32.919 align:start position:0%
supervisor of the
 
00:34:34.990 --> 00:34:35.000 align:start position:0%
checklist and then they review the
 
00:34:37.230 --> 00:34:37.240 align:start position:0%
voter's qualifications and determine if
 
00:34:42.470 --> 00:34:42.480 align:start position:0%
the proof of residency or doile is valid
 
00:34:44.909 --> 00:34:44.919 align:start position:0%
and if they are established the voter is
 
00:34:47.030 --> 00:34:47.040 align:start position:0%
allowed to vote if the supervisor of the
 
00:34:49.550 --> 00:34:49.560 align:start position:0%
checklist determines that they have not
 
00:34:51.550 --> 00:34:51.560 align:start position:0%
been established they shall not be
 
00:34:55.550 --> 00:34:55.560 align:start position:0%
allowed to vote um and it says a voter
 
00:34:57.150 --> 00:34:57.160 align:start position:0%
not allowed to vote as a result the
 
00:34:59.270 --> 00:34:59.280 align:start position:0%
determination of the supervisor of the
 
00:35:01.550 --> 00:35:01.560 align:start position:0%
checklist may take an immediate appeal
 
00:35:05.990 --> 00:35:06.000 align:start position:0%
to the Superior Court as provided in RSA
 
00:35:10.829 --> 00:35:10.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:17.030 --> 00:35:17.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:21.030 --> 00:35:21.040 align:start position:0%
again I believe just double check that I
 
00:35:22.550 --> 00:35:22.560 align:start position:0%
believe this would
 
00:35:25.230 --> 00:35:25.240 align:start position:0%
be we're checking
 
00:35:27.829 --> 00:35:27.839 align:start position:0%
in but
 
00:35:31.790 --> 00:35:31.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:34.710 --> 00:35:34.720 align:start position:0%
where one that's effective is not in the
 
00:35:36.950 --> 00:35:36.960 align:start position:0%
purple book
 
00:35:36.960 --> 00:35:44.710 align:start position:0%
purple book
right

00:35:44.710 --> 00:35:44.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:50.870 --> 00:35:50.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:50.880 --> 00:35:52.950 align:start position:0%
 
11

00:35:52.950 --> 00:35:52.960 align:start position:0%
11
 
00:36:02.069 --> 00:36:02.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:05.349 --> 00:36:05.359 align:start position:0%
yes have to bear with me for a moment
 
00:36:55.550 --> 00:36:55.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:58.230 --> 00:36:58.240 align:start position:0%
okay um
 
00:37:01.030 --> 00:37:01.040 align:start position:0%
yeah so this is the hours of polling
 
00:37:05.710 --> 00:37:05.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:05.720 --> 00:37:13.750 align:start position:0%
 
65913

00:37:13.750 --> 00:37:13.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:16.950 --> 00:37:16.960 align:start position:0%
um and then the new
 
00:37:21.910 --> 00:37:21.920 align:start position:0%
paragraph for C1 starts out just um for
 
00:37:23.990 --> 00:37:24.000 align:start position:0%
so everyone knows if the voter does not
 
00:37:25.829 --> 00:37:25.839 align:start position:0%
have a valid photo
 
00:37:28.150 --> 00:37:28.160 align:start position:0%
identification uh clerk shall direct the
 
00:37:33.710 --> 00:37:33.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:35.950 --> 00:37:35.960 align:start position:0%
checklist see make sure I have the right
 
00:37:35.960 --> 00:37:36.950 align:start position:0%
checklist see make sure I have the right
one

00:37:36.950 --> 00:37:36.960 align:start position:0%
one
 
00:37:39.230 --> 00:37:39.240 align:start position:0%
yep yeah so it seems that this bill is
 
00:37:42.150 --> 00:37:42.160 align:start position:0%
trying to take uh remove what happens if
 
00:37:45.069 --> 00:37:45.079 align:start position:0%
they don't have a valid photo ID and
 
00:37:47.589 --> 00:37:47.599 align:start position:0%
insert if they don't have a valid
 
00:37:47.599 --> 00:37:49.470 align:start position:0%
insert if they don't have a valid
domicile

00:37:49.470 --> 00:37:49.480 align:start position:0%
domicile
 
00:37:49.480 --> 00:37:51.150 align:start position:0%
domicile
proof

00:37:51.150 --> 00:37:51.160 align:start position:0%
proof
 
00:37:54.750 --> 00:37:54.760 align:start position:0%
which isn't required in any way shape or
 
00:37:57.950 --> 00:37:57.960 align:start position:0%
form at this time at obtaining a b
 
00:38:01.510 --> 00:38:01.520 align:start position:0%
which seems rather odd to me
 
00:38:06.069 --> 00:38:06.079 align:start position:0%
right and just not a not a bill that's
 
00:38:08.710 --> 00:38:08.720 align:start position:0%
sort of it's changing something that in
 
00:38:10.589 --> 00:38:10.599 align:start position:0%
the wrong place if
 
00:38:13.230 --> 00:38:13.240 align:start position:0%
anything to me I just don't understand
 
00:38:15.069 --> 00:38:15.079 align:start position:0%
where they're coming from right and
 
00:38:16.550 --> 00:38:16.560 align:start position:0%
unfortunately I think this was the one
 
00:38:18.829 --> 00:38:18.839 align:start position:0%
the sponsor was not available to answer
 
00:38:20.190 --> 00:38:20.200 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
00:38:23.270 --> 00:38:23.280 align:start position:0%
on right I I think you're right I I
 
00:38:25.230 --> 00:38:25.240 align:start position:0%
recall that thank you representative
 
00:38:28.190 --> 00:38:28.200 align:start position:0%
Nome I do believe that is correct I
 
00:38:32.510 --> 00:38:32.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:35.109 --> 00:38:35.119 align:start position:0%
is I think that is a problem this may be
 
00:38:37.550 --> 00:38:37.560 align:start position:0%
one that that we end up returning to the
 
00:38:39.750 --> 00:38:39.760 align:start position:0%
election law committee early
 
00:38:39.760 --> 00:38:41.829 align:start position:0%
election law committee early
for

00:38:41.829 --> 00:38:41.839 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:38:44.309 --> 00:38:44.319 align:start position:0%
uh address
 
00:38:46.270 --> 00:38:46.280 align:start position:0%
that well I think the word you're
 
00:38:48.630 --> 00:38:48.640 align:start position:0%
looking for well I
 
00:38:51.030 --> 00:38:51.040 align:start position:0%
yes I'm trying to give some difference
 
00:38:55.230 --> 00:38:55.240 align:start position:0%
to the sponsors and and so on but
 
00:38:59.589 --> 00:38:59.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:01.829 --> 00:39:01.839 align:start position:0%
I think that this is the yeah my notes
 
00:39:03.990 --> 00:39:04.000 align:start position:0%
my notes indicate that secretary seanin
 
00:39:06.109 --> 00:39:06.119 align:start position:0%
said that there was no requirement to
 
00:39:08.910 --> 00:39:08.920 align:start position:0%
show domicile when checking in and that
 
00:39:12.150 --> 00:39:12.160 align:start position:0%
this was a conflation of two process
 
00:39:14.390 --> 00:39:14.400 align:start position:0%
processes is that process processes
 
00:39:18.190 --> 00:39:18.200 align:start position:0%
processes yeah uh and uh it it makes he
 
00:39:19.870 --> 00:39:19.880 align:start position:0%
also suggested it would make check-in
 
00:39:22.190 --> 00:39:22.200 align:start position:0%
chaotic and a disaster I think those
 
00:39:25.510 --> 00:39:25.520 align:start position:0%
were his exact words right so I and and
 
00:39:29.030 --> 00:39:29.040 align:start position:0%
I think um I think in agreement that you
 
00:39:31.270 --> 00:39:31.280 align:start position:0%
know as as I think I said in my sort of
 
00:39:35.069 --> 00:39:35.079 align:start position:0%
opening drawn out opening remarks that
 
00:39:37.430 --> 00:39:37.440 align:start position:0%
um there is a registration process and a
 
00:39:41.750 --> 00:39:41.760 align:start position:0%
check-in process and and if the two are
 
00:39:45.710 --> 00:39:45.720 align:start position:0%
being conflated then um that is not
 
00:39:48.150 --> 00:39:48.160 align:start position:0%
something we necessarily want to do it's
 
00:39:50.190 --> 00:39:50.200 align:start position:0%
uh if I give the sponsor the benefit of
 
00:39:53.309 --> 00:39:53.319 align:start position:0%
the doubt I'm assuming that perhaps this
 
00:39:57.550 --> 00:39:57.560 align:start position:0%
was the thought process was the same day
 
00:40:00.349 --> 00:40:00.359 align:start position:0%
registration and they were trying to
 
00:40:02.990 --> 00:40:03.000 align:start position:0%
address that aspect but this is the
 
00:40:05.710 --> 00:40:05.720 align:start position:0%
incorrect place to do that and I just
 
00:40:07.630 --> 00:40:07.640 align:start position:0%
want to um I think my I was I may have
 
00:40:11.150 --> 00:40:11.160 align:start position:0%
misspoken when I said the uh um sponsor
 
00:40:13.150 --> 00:40:13.160 align:start position:0%
was not there I'm not 100% sure on that
 
00:40:15.270 --> 00:40:15.280 align:start position:0%
I may have been looking at my notes on a
 
00:40:16.710 --> 00:40:16.720 align:start position:0%
different bill so I don't want to I want
 
00:40:18.710 --> 00:40:18.720 align:start position:0%
to remove my comment about that I'm not
 
00:40:20.870 --> 00:40:20.880 align:start position:0%
sure no but she did she introduced the
 
00:40:23.150 --> 00:40:23.160 align:start position:0%
bill very quickly and then left because
 
00:40:24.990 --> 00:40:25.000 align:start position:0%
she had to be in another committee and
 
00:40:26.870 --> 00:40:26.880 align:start position:0%
she did not take any questions so she
 
00:40:29.270 --> 00:40:29.280 align:start position:0%
was here here briefly but then left I
 
00:40:31.270 --> 00:40:31.280 align:start position:0%
just want I I was looking at my notes on
 
00:40:33.309 --> 00:40:33.319 align:start position:0%
a different bill so thanks thanks for
 
00:40:36.510 --> 00:40:36.520 align:start position:0%
clarifying that representative L I um I
 
00:40:38.390 --> 00:40:38.400 align:start position:0%
look at this and I think it applies to
 
00:40:41.069 --> 00:40:41.079 align:start position:0%
all the bills that we deal with is we
 
00:40:42.790 --> 00:40:42.800 align:start position:0%
need to be very careful about
 
00:40:45.630 --> 00:40:45.640 align:start position:0%
distinguishing registering to vote
 
00:40:48.750 --> 00:40:48.760 align:start position:0%
versus voting and the registering to
 
00:40:52.870 --> 00:40:52.880 align:start position:0%
vote um there's an inperson process
 
00:40:56.470 --> 00:40:56.480 align:start position:0%
there's a by mail process and same day
 
00:40:59.710 --> 00:40:59.720 align:start position:0%
process so same dat process is probably
 
00:41:02.390 --> 00:41:02.400 align:start position:0%
very similar to the inperson
 
00:41:05.510 --> 00:41:05.520 align:start position:0%
process and then the other is obtaining
 
00:41:08.109 --> 00:41:08.119 align:start position:0%
a boat uh a ballot and voting which
 
00:41:11.150 --> 00:41:11.160 align:start position:0%
would be in person and absentee so we
 
00:41:11.160 --> 00:41:11.990 align:start position:0%
would be in person and absentee so we
need

00:41:11.990 --> 00:41:12.000 align:start position:0%
need
 
00:41:16.550 --> 00:41:16.560 align:start position:0%
to keep the registering and and voting
 
00:41:19.710 --> 00:41:19.720 align:start position:0%
separate yes and I uh thank you
 
00:41:21.589 --> 00:41:21.599 align:start position:0%
representative C I think that's
 
00:41:26.030 --> 00:41:26.040 align:start position:0%
absolutely right I think um we we want
 
00:41:27.750 --> 00:41:27.760 align:start position:0%
to keep those two process
 
00:41:29.990 --> 00:41:30.000 align:start position:0%
separate but we also want to make them a
 
00:41:34.829 --> 00:41:34.839 align:start position:0%
Level Playing Field for all voters so
 
00:41:38.430 --> 00:41:38.440 align:start position:0%
um but that Level Playing Field must
 
00:41:43.270 --> 00:41:43.280 align:start position:0%
meet a minimum threshold of
 
00:41:47.309 --> 00:41:47.319 align:start position:0%
um authenticity so that we can ensure
 
00:41:49.069 --> 00:41:49.079 align:start position:0%
the public that our elections are safe
 
00:41:53.470 --> 00:41:53.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:53.480 --> 00:41:55.630 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:41:55.630 --> 00:41:55.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:42:03.829 --> 00:42:03.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:06.829 --> 00:42:06.839 align:start position:0%
um I'm not sure if this if we can make
 
00:42:09.430 --> 00:42:09.440 align:start position:0%
an official motion but I I think this
 
00:42:11.670 --> 00:42:11.680 align:start position:0%
might be one that we could return to the
 
00:42:13.430 --> 00:42:13.440 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure if this is an action that a
 
00:42:15.230 --> 00:42:15.240 align:start position:0%
subcommittee could take but I think this
 
00:42:17.190 --> 00:42:17.200 align:start position:0%
is one that we could possibly return to
 
00:42:19.270 --> 00:42:19.280 align:start position:0%
the election law committee for further
 
00:42:23.430 --> 00:42:23.440 align:start position:0%
action does um I would agree I just
 
00:42:25.549 --> 00:42:25.559 align:start position:0%
don't know what the process I don't know
 
00:42:28.790 --> 00:42:28.800 align:start position:0%
what the do we have to make a formal
 
00:42:31.750 --> 00:42:31.760 align:start position:0%
Vote or do we just recommend it back go
 
00:42:33.990 --> 00:42:34.000 align:start position:0%
ahead and recommend it back and I we
 
00:42:36.270 --> 00:42:36.280 align:start position:0%
have some time to do it so we could we
 
00:42:38.549 --> 00:42:38.559 align:start position:0%
could check in with we could do that and
 
00:42:41.710 --> 00:42:41.720 align:start position:0%
then check in so we know the intent for
 
00:42:43.549 --> 00:42:43.559 align:start position:0%
what we want to do with this particular
 
00:42:45.910 --> 00:42:45.920 align:start position:0%
bill for that reason so I think let's
 
00:42:47.910 --> 00:42:47.920 align:start position:0%
check in with
 
00:42:51.549 --> 00:42:51.559 align:start position:0%
um uh the powers that
 
00:43:02.910 --> 00:43:02.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:07.109 --> 00:43:07.119 align:start position:0%
uh if a if the subcommittee is going to
 
00:43:10.430 --> 00:43:10.440 align:start position:0%
refer a bill back to the main committee
 
00:43:13.950 --> 00:43:13.960 align:start position:0%
is there a defined process for
 
00:43:16.430 --> 00:43:16.440 align:start position:0%
that thank
 
00:43:18.790 --> 00:43:18.800 align:start position:0%
you all right so we have I think we have
 
00:43:22.230 --> 00:43:22.240 align:start position:0%
an action that we can take with this um
 
00:43:22.240 --> 00:43:23.109 align:start position:0%
an action that we can take with this um
and

00:43:23.109 --> 00:43:23.119 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:43:27.230 --> 00:43:27.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:29.910 --> 00:43:29.920 align:start position:0%
you know I would I would note on just on
 
00:43:32.630 --> 00:43:32.640 align:start position:0%
behalf of the uh Prime sponsor and the
 
00:43:34.630 --> 00:43:34.640 align:start position:0%
other sponsors listed there that if
 
00:43:37.150 --> 00:43:37.160 align:start position:0%
there are some good
 
00:43:40.470 --> 00:43:40.480 align:start position:0%
elements um that belong in another
 
00:43:44.349 --> 00:43:44.359 align:start position:0%
process we should consider those but
 
00:43:50.990 --> 00:43:51.000 align:start position:0%
um um so before we dispose of this uh I
 
00:43:53.030 --> 00:43:53.040 align:start position:0%
I encourage the subcommittee to review
 
00:43:55.109 --> 00:43:55.119 align:start position:0%
this to see if there are pertinent
 
00:43:58.470 --> 00:43:58.480 align:start position:0%
elements that we would want to uh use in
 
00:44:02.430 --> 00:44:02.440 align:start position:0%
another bill perhaps uh for processing
 
00:44:06.190 --> 00:44:06.200 align:start position:0%
purposes um in terms of you know if
 
00:44:08.750 --> 00:44:08.760 align:start position:0%
proof of domicile is appropriate
 
00:44:12.710 --> 00:44:12.720 align:start position:0%
under um registration and there's
 
00:44:14.630 --> 00:44:14.640 align:start position:0%
elements here that are not already
 
00:44:16.829 --> 00:44:16.839 align:start position:0%
addressed in the RSA then that might be
 
00:44:20.150 --> 00:44:20.160 align:start position:0%
something worth considering it's it's a
 
00:44:21.950 --> 00:44:21.960 align:start position:0%
homework assignment for myself to go
 
00:44:23.430 --> 00:44:23.440 align:start position:0%
back and double check that to see if
 
00:44:25.589 --> 00:44:25.599 align:start position:0%
there's any elements there that that
 
00:44:27.630 --> 00:44:27.640 align:start position:0%
would be an improvement to the current
 
00:44:30.470 --> 00:44:30.480 align:start position:0%
process uh currently defined process and
 
00:44:33.990 --> 00:44:34.000 align:start position:0%
if there are then uh that would be also
 
00:44:36.549 --> 00:44:36.559 align:start position:0%
one of our recommendations out of out of
 
00:44:40.069 --> 00:44:40.079 align:start position:0%
at least the majority report uh and we
 
00:44:44.230 --> 00:44:44.240 align:start position:0%
would um but we would still uh get this
 
00:44:48.109 --> 00:44:48.119 align:start position:0%
bill back to election law so that we can
 
00:44:50.589 --> 00:44:50.599 align:start position:0%
process these
 
00:44:53.390 --> 00:44:53.400 align:start position:0%
um uh more effectively for the house
 
00:44:55.510 --> 00:44:55.520 align:start position:0%
sessions as
 
00:44:58.430 --> 00:44:58.440 align:start position:0%
well all right if I may yes
 
00:45:00.910 --> 00:45:00.920 align:start position:0%
representative see this bill sort of
 
00:45:03.589 --> 00:45:03.599 align:start position:0%
shows what happens when you conflate
 
00:45:06.349 --> 00:45:06.359 align:start position:0%
different processes into this if this
 
00:45:10.150 --> 00:45:10.160 align:start position:0%
Bill had had part one be uh dealing with
 
00:45:12.270 --> 00:45:12.280 align:start position:0%
registration and part two dealing with
 
00:45:14.990 --> 00:45:15.000 align:start position:0%
voting then we could have more easily
 
00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:18.349 align:start position:0%
voting then we could have more easily
considered

00:45:18.349 --> 00:45:18.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:21.030 --> 00:45:21.040 align:start position:0%
it yes thank you represent C I think
 
00:45:24.190 --> 00:45:24.200 align:start position:0%
that's that's important it it's
 
00:45:29.430 --> 00:45:29.440 align:start position:0%
um as as the secretary State noted in
 
00:45:32.309 --> 00:45:32.319 align:start position:0%
his testimony there was a conflation of
 
00:45:35.829 --> 00:45:35.839 align:start position:0%
processes and I think that um we do see
 
00:45:37.549 --> 00:45:37.559 align:start position:0%
that as as I'm sure many other
 
00:45:39.710 --> 00:45:39.720 align:start position:0%
committees see that we we often see that
 
00:45:42.190 --> 00:45:42.200 align:start position:0%
in election law where people are
 
00:45:44.990 --> 00:45:45.000 align:start position:0%
conflating uh different
 
00:45:48.950 --> 00:45:48.960 align:start position:0%
processes and um and
 
00:45:53.069 --> 00:45:53.079 align:start position:0%
the so again just just like we need to
 
00:45:56.270 --> 00:45:56.280 align:start position:0%
think about registration and then
 
00:45:56.280 --> 00:45:57.549 align:start position:0%
think about registration and then
checkin

00:45:57.549 --> 00:45:57.559 align:start position:0%
checkin
 
00:46:01.030 --> 00:46:01.040 align:start position:0%
to obtain the ballot and then we as rep
 
00:46:04.150 --> 00:46:04.160 align:start position:0%
to C outlined we need to also think
 
00:46:06.589 --> 00:46:06.599 align:start position:0%
about some subcategories that
 
00:46:06.599 --> 00:46:07.750 align:start position:0%
about some subcategories that
occasionally

00:46:07.750 --> 00:46:07.760 align:start position:0%
occasionally
 
00:46:11.829 --> 00:46:11.839 align:start position:0%
occur um during those processes so you
 
00:46:14.309 --> 00:46:14.319 align:start position:0%
we have same day you know we have
 
00:46:17.069 --> 00:46:17.079 align:start position:0%
pre-registered same day registered
 
00:46:20.750 --> 00:46:20.760 align:start position:0%
absentee ballot aspects in in cases
 
00:46:22.710 --> 00:46:22.720 align:start position:0%
where they may not have been a
 
00:46:25.549 --> 00:46:25.559 align:start position:0%
pre-registered voter as
 
00:46:27.510 --> 00:46:27.520 align:start position:0%
well so
 
00:46:29.870 --> 00:46:29.880 align:start position:0%
um all
 
00:46:34.349 --> 00:46:34.359 align:start position:0%
right so let us now move on to we've
 
00:46:38.870 --> 00:46:38.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:41.430 --> 00:46:41.440 align:start position:0%
65913 uh the next one
 
00:46:41.440 --> 00:46:43.790 align:start position:0%
65913 uh the next one
is

00:46:43.790 --> 00:46:43.800 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:46:47.829 --> 00:46:47.839 align:start position:0%
618 um representative C that is your
 
00:46:51.750 --> 00:46:51.760 align:start position:0%
bill would you like to make um any
 
00:46:54.069 --> 00:46:54.079 align:start position:0%
specific comments with respect to that
 
00:46:56.390 --> 00:46:56.400 align:start position:0%
bill I'll give you the floor for the
 
00:46:59.150 --> 00:46:59.160 align:start position:0%
moment to there's anything you wish to
 
00:47:03.510 --> 00:47:03.520 align:start position:0%
say about that okay this one was um
 
00:47:05.910 --> 00:47:05.920 align:start position:0%
dealing with
 
00:47:10.390 --> 00:47:10.400 align:start position:0%
um using an out ofate um driver's
 
00:47:12.349 --> 00:47:12.359 align:start position:0%
license or ID
 
00:47:17.349 --> 00:47:17.359 align:start position:0%
for uh to go vote and the idea here was
 
00:47:21.430 --> 00:47:21.440 align:start position:0%
that we're supposed to get if we move to
 
00:47:24.630 --> 00:47:24.640 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire we should get uh within 60
 
00:47:28.030 --> 00:47:28.040 align:start position:0%
days the uh a New Hampshire driver's
 
00:47:31.670 --> 00:47:31.680 align:start position:0%
license and do any other things that uh
 
00:47:33.630 --> 00:47:33.640 align:start position:0%
are incumbent upon someone changing
 
00:47:33.640 --> 00:47:34.670 align:start position:0%
are incumbent upon someone changing
their

00:47:34.670 --> 00:47:34.680 align:start position:0%
their
 
00:47:37.549 --> 00:47:37.559 align:start position:0%
domicile and what this does is just
 
00:47:40.589 --> 00:47:40.599 align:start position:0%
allow a one-time exception to use an out
 
00:47:42.870 --> 00:47:42.880 align:start position:0%
of state driver relation assuming that
 
00:47:45.349 --> 00:47:45.359 align:start position:0%
the person came just moved to the state
 
00:47:47.309 --> 00:47:47.319 align:start position:0%
and had not yet had a chance to go to
 
00:47:49.230 --> 00:47:49.240 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
00:47:53.790 --> 00:47:53.800 align:start position:0%
DMV um so it
 
00:47:58.670 --> 00:47:58.680 align:start position:0%
was basically to uh
 
00:48:01.270 --> 00:48:01.280 align:start position:0%
um give people who just moved in the
 
00:48:03.950 --> 00:48:03.960 align:start position:0%
state that
 
00:48:09.309 --> 00:48:09.319 align:start position:0%
um opportunity to vote without being
 
00:48:13.069 --> 00:48:13.079 align:start position:0%
harassed too much but the idea was that
 
00:48:15.750 --> 00:48:15.760 align:start position:0%
the uh supervisor checklist and I
 
00:48:18.750 --> 00:48:18.760 align:start position:0%
believe it was in there on
 
00:48:18.760 --> 00:48:22.870 align:start position:0%
believe it was in there on
U

00:48:22.870 --> 00:48:22.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:28.069 --> 00:48:28.079 align:start position:0%
um yeah on page one line in
 
00:48:31.549 --> 00:48:31.559 align:start position:0%
um 19 and 20 it says the ballot clerk
 
00:48:34.270 --> 00:48:34.280 align:start position:0%
shall also advise the voter that this
 
00:48:37.230 --> 00:48:37.240 align:start position:0%
out of state license or ID may not be
 
00:48:39.670 --> 00:48:39.680 align:start position:0%
used for voting purposes
 
00:48:39.680 --> 00:48:41.390 align:start position:0%
used for voting purposes
again

00:48:41.390 --> 00:48:41.400 align:start position:0%
again
 
00:48:44.710 --> 00:48:44.720 align:start position:0%
so if somebody is moving to New
 
00:48:46.950 --> 00:48:46.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire they need to do all those
 
00:48:49.549 --> 00:48:49.559 align:start position:0%
steps that are incumbent upon changing
 
00:48:49.559 --> 00:48:55.510 align:start position:0%
steps that are incumbent upon changing
your

00:48:55.510 --> 00:48:55.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:59.109 --> 00:48:59.119 align:start position:0%
domicile right and this is thank you
 
00:49:04.150 --> 00:49:04.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:04.160 --> 00:49:05.670 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:49:05.670 --> 00:49:05.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:49:08.549 --> 00:49:08.559 align:start position:0%
and just for
 
00:49:13.990 --> 00:49:14.000 align:start position:0%
context um I'll ref uh I'll refer people
 
00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:17.190 align:start position:0%
context um I'll ref uh I'll refer people
to

00:49:17.190 --> 00:49:17.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:22.710 --> 00:49:22.720 align:start position:0%
um Mr Allen's memo that talks about um
 
00:49:26.109 --> 00:49:26.119 align:start position:0%
let me see if I have that handy here but
 
00:49:31.270 --> 00:49:31.280 align:start position:0%
um that talks specifically about
 
00:49:34.750 --> 00:49:34.760 align:start position:0%
uh the definitions of dool and residence
 
00:49:37.789 --> 00:49:37.799 align:start position:0%
and that um one aspect of this and I'm
 
00:49:40.030 --> 00:49:40.040 align:start position:0%
just taking this from the statute rather
 
00:49:42.870 --> 00:49:42.880 align:start position:0%
than um an inhabitants domicile for
 
00:49:46.430 --> 00:49:46.440 align:start position:0%
voting purposes is one is that one place
 
00:49:48.109 --> 00:49:48.119 align:start position:0%
where a person more than any other place
 
00:49:50.390 --> 00:49:50.400 align:start position:0%
has established a physical presence and
 
00:49:53.150 --> 00:49:53.160 align:start position:0%
manifests an intent to maintain a single
 
00:49:55.150 --> 00:49:55.160 align:start position:0%
continuous presence for domestic civil
 
00:49:57.349 --> 00:49:57.359 align:start position:0%
and civil purposes relevant to
 
00:49:59.270 --> 00:49:59.280 align:start position:0%
participating in Democratic
 
00:50:00.910 --> 00:50:00.920 align:start position:0%
self-government they have the right to
 
00:50:00.920 --> 00:50:01.910 align:start position:0%
self-government they have the right to
change

00:50:01.910 --> 00:50:01.920 align:start position:0%
change
 
00:50:04.990 --> 00:50:05.000 align:start position:0%
domicile but the uh but an intent to
 
00:50:06.430 --> 00:50:06.440 align:start position:0%
change it in the future doesn't
 
00:50:09.510 --> 00:50:09.520 align:start position:0%
necessarily uh apply in those uh
 
00:50:12.910 --> 00:50:12.920 align:start position:0%
circumstances so the I think we we also
 
00:50:12.920 --> 00:50:13.990 align:start position:0%
circumstances so the I think we we also
heard

00:50:13.990 --> 00:50:14.000 align:start position:0%
heard
 
00:50:17.549 --> 00:50:17.559 align:start position:0%

Declaration of an intent to establish

00:50:34.190 --> 00:50:34.200 align:start position:0%
for uh Motor Vehicle Registration kick

license excuse me so um that might be
 
00:50:44.190 --> 00:50:44.200 align:start position:0%
something that the uh Secretary of
 
00:50:47.589 --> 00:50:47.599 align:start position:0%
State's office could comment on if um
 
00:50:49.589 --> 00:50:49.599 align:start position:0%
that's possible is with respect to a
 
00:50:52.789 --> 00:50:52.799 align:start position:0%
driver's license whether whether uh when
 
00:50:54.789 --> 00:50:54.799 align:start position:0%
a person votes for the first time using
 
00:50:57.390 --> 00:50:57.400 align:start position:0%
an out of-state driver's license what
 
00:50:59.950 --> 00:50:59.960 align:start position:0%
aspects kick in at that at that point
 
00:51:02.829 --> 00:51:02.839 align:start position:0%
would you be able to uh accommodate us
 
00:51:05.950 --> 00:51:05.960 align:start position:0%
here deputy secretary I welcome um

thank you for having me happy Friday
 
00:51:17.829 --> 00:51:17.839 align:start position:0%
everyone uh Aaron Hennessy deputy
 
00:51:19.829 --> 00:51:19.839 align:start position:0%
secretary of state I was just trying to
 
00:51:22.470 --> 00:51:22.480 align:start position:0%
look up I know there is a well I'll go
 
00:51:25.390 --> 00:51:25.400 align:start position:0%
through another bill that is in front of
 
00:51:27.710 --> 00:51:27.720 align:start position:0%
a different committee um I believe you
 
00:51:29.829 --> 00:51:29.839 align:start position:0%
may have just voted on it in the house
 
00:51:31.750 --> 00:51:31.760 align:start position:0%
yesterday there is a bill that went
 
00:51:32.990 --> 00:51:33.000 align:start position:0%
through house
 
00:51:35.030 --> 00:51:35.040 align:start position:0%
transportation that requires the
 
00:51:37.829 --> 00:51:37.839 align:start position:0%
Department of Motor Vehicles to use the
 
00:51:39.750 --> 00:51:39.760 align:start position:0%
information that we collect in our
 
00:51:42.430 --> 00:51:42.440 align:start position:0%
Statewide voter registration system that
 
00:51:45.670 --> 00:51:45.680 align:start position:0%
identifies voters who have used an out
 
00:51:49.069 --> 00:51:49.079 align:start position:0%
ofate out ofate driver's license um and
 
00:51:51.150 --> 00:51:51.160 align:start position:0%
I I don't know the exact wording that
 
00:51:54.030 --> 00:51:54.040 align:start position:0%
Transportation decided on but it would
 
00:51:57.470 --> 00:51:57.480 align:start position:0%
require the DMV to then contact those
 
00:52:01.109 --> 00:52:01.119 align:start position:0%
voters to say reminder this is state law
 
00:52:03.069 --> 00:52:03.079 align:start position:0%
you've used this driver's license you
 
00:52:05.829 --> 00:52:05.839 align:start position:0%
are required if you are driving here in
 
00:52:08.710 --> 00:52:08.720 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire to get a a um a New
 
00:52:11.109 --> 00:52:11.119 align:start position:0%
Hampshire driver's license but currently
 
00:52:14.030 --> 00:52:14.040 align:start position:0%
what our office does there is
 
00:52:17.670 --> 00:52:17.680 align:start position:0%
a um a different law and I apologize I
 
00:52:19.549 --> 00:52:19.559 align:start position:0%
don't have it in front of me that
 
00:52:25.069 --> 00:52:25.079 align:start position:0%
requires us to send um letters to people
 
00:52:27.390 --> 00:52:27.400 align:start position:0%
who used an out ofate driver's license
 
00:52:30.750 --> 00:52:30.760 align:start position:0%
to check in to inform them of the law
 
00:52:33.510 --> 00:52:33.520 align:start position:0%
that they but there's no would say
 
00:52:36.109 --> 00:52:36.119 align:start position:0%
there's no ramifications otherwise it's
 
00:52:38.870 --> 00:52:38.880 align:start position:0%
just an in informing them that you
 
00:52:40.670 --> 00:52:40.680 align:start position:0%
checked in with an out of state driver's
 
00:52:42.990 --> 00:52:43.000 align:start position:0%
license but there's
 
00:52:46.030 --> 00:52:46.040 align:start position:0%
no they don't need to follow up um to
 
00:52:51.829 --> 00:52:51.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:54.950 --> 00:52:54.960 align:start position:0%
letter all uh thank you I think it was
 
00:52:57.309 --> 00:52:57.319 align:start position:0%
House Bill 133 that from the
 
00:53:00.710 --> 00:53:00.720 align:start position:0%
Transportation that um I if if memory
 
00:53:05.069 --> 00:53:05.079 align:start position:0%
serves me correctly um um
 
00:53:05.079 --> 00:53:06.710 align:start position:0%
serves me correctly um um
so

00:53:06.710 --> 00:53:06.720 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:53:06.720 --> 00:53:08.510 align:start position:0%
so
uh

00:53:08.510 --> 00:53:08.520 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:53:11.230 --> 00:53:11.240 align:start position:0%
that um and so that would require the
 
00:53:16.109 --> 00:53:16.119 align:start position:0%
DMV to I I believe contact these uh
 
00:53:18.349 --> 00:53:18.359 align:start position:0%
persons who voted with an outof state
 
00:53:22.630 --> 00:53:22.640 align:start position:0%
driver's license that now that through
 
00:53:24.470 --> 00:53:24.480 align:start position:0%
the active voting they've declared their
 
00:53:26.549 --> 00:53:26.559 align:start position:0%
intent to maintain that presence then
 
00:53:29.030 --> 00:53:29.040 align:start position:0%
they have to comply with the
 
00:53:32.390 --> 00:53:32.400 align:start position:0%
other uh legal requirements that New
 
00:53:33.910 --> 00:53:33.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has established for those who
 
00:53:35.789 --> 00:53:35.799 align:start position:0%
move to New
 
00:53:39.030 --> 00:53:39.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire yes I believe that's um I I
 
00:53:41.190 --> 00:53:41.200 align:start position:0%
have not worded it as graciously no
 
00:53:43.829 --> 00:53:43.839 align:start position:0%
doubt I have not worded it as graciously
 
00:53:46.829 --> 00:53:46.839 align:start position:0%
as um the bill has but uh that's the
 
00:53:48.910 --> 00:53:48.920 align:start position:0%
essence of yeah and and I would just say
 
00:53:51.710 --> 00:53:51.720 align:start position:0%
that um the DMV I believe would not
 
00:53:53.870 --> 00:53:53.880 align:start position:0%
contact somebody if when they were
 
00:53:55.349 --> 00:53:55.359 align:start position:0%
provided the information from our
 
00:53:57.910 --> 00:53:57.920 align:start position:0%
department um um that they their
 
00:54:00.309 --> 00:54:00.319 align:start position:0%
database now shows that that person does
 
00:54:02.990 --> 00:54:03.000 align:start position:0%
now have a driver's license so the two
 
00:54:04.950 --> 00:54:04.960 align:start position:0%
database information would be bumped up
 
00:54:06.710 --> 00:54:06.720 align:start position:0%
against each
 
00:54:09.910 --> 00:54:09.920 align:start position:0%
other yes thank you as I uh just to
 
00:54:12.589 --> 00:54:12.599 align:start position:0%
remind everyone the testimony during
 
00:54:17.789 --> 00:54:17.799 align:start position:0%
that house bill 133 determined that
 
00:54:20.870 --> 00:54:20.880 align:start position:0%
um I I think the year was 2016 and there
 
00:54:23.390 --> 00:54:23.400 align:start position:0%
may be updated information but that the
 
00:54:27.549 --> 00:54:27.559 align:start position:0%
compliance rate was something like uh um
 
00:54:30.349 --> 00:54:30.359 align:start position:0%
less than 20% of those who actually
 
00:54:34.069 --> 00:54:34.079 align:start position:0%
did uh transfer their their driver's
 
00:54:37.430 --> 00:54:37.440 align:start position:0%
license over to New Hampshire it was I
 
00:54:39.710 --> 00:54:39.720 align:start position:0%
believe 80 I think the actual number
 
00:54:42.589 --> 00:54:42.599 align:start position:0%
that was used in testimony was 86%
 
00:54:45.870 --> 00:54:45.880 align:start position:0%
failed to comply with the request and so
 
00:54:49.549 --> 00:54:49.559 align:start position:0%
I think this is um certainly something
 
00:54:53.030 --> 00:54:53.040 align:start position:0%
that we we want to make sure we address
 
00:54:54.789 --> 00:54:54.799 align:start position:0%
because that level of compliance is
 
00:54:56.750 --> 00:54:56.760 align:start position:0%
really unacceptable
 
00:54:59.589 --> 00:54:59.599 align:start position:0%
um so hope hopefully House Bill 133 has
 
00:55:01.430 --> 00:55:01.440 align:start position:0%
done that
 
00:55:01.440 --> 00:55:03.950 align:start position:0%
done that
um

00:55:03.950 --> 00:55:03.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:55:03.960 --> 00:55:06.270 align:start position:0%
um
and

00:55:06.270 --> 00:55:06.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:55:09.870 --> 00:55:09.880 align:start position:0%
um would I know this is kind of
 
00:55:12.150 --> 00:55:12.160 align:start position:0%
preliminary question but would the
 
00:55:14.549 --> 00:55:14.559 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State's office
 
00:55:14.559 --> 00:55:16.109 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State's office
anticipate

00:55:16.109 --> 00:55:16.119 align:start position:0%
anticipate
 
00:55:19.710 --> 00:55:19.720 align:start position:0%
uh more coordination with the DMV for
 
00:55:22.510 --> 00:55:22.520 align:start position:0%
the purposes of this or
 
00:55:25.349 --> 00:55:25.359 align:start position:0%
or I mean you already you already sent
 
00:55:27.190 --> 00:55:27.200 align:start position:0%
to them a list
 
00:55:31.190 --> 00:55:31.200 align:start position:0%
right uh we we actually send we would be
 
00:55:33.470 --> 00:55:33.480 align:start position:0%
sending the list to them now we already
 
00:55:35.430 --> 00:55:35.440 align:start position:0%
have the information we already do some
 
00:55:38.510 --> 00:55:38.520 align:start position:0%
letters um through our office um some of
 
00:55:40.750 --> 00:55:40.760 align:start position:0%
the letters we won't need to do anymore
 
00:55:43.990 --> 00:55:44.000 align:start position:0%
because they were affidavit related but
 
00:55:47.910 --> 00:55:47.920 align:start position:0%
um this would require us we already do
 
00:55:49.789 --> 00:55:49.799 align:start position:0%
have some shared information with that
 
00:55:53.069 --> 00:55:53.079 align:start position:0%
department um because of Hava um Rel
 
00:55:56.430 --> 00:55:56.440 align:start position:0%
Hava law requirements but this would be
 
00:55:59.230 --> 00:55:59.240 align:start position:0%
and an easy database share uh
 
00:56:01.510 --> 00:56:01.520 align:start position:0%
information share um if you can imagine
 
00:56:05.950 --> 00:56:05.960 align:start position:0%
a report but um that's related to HB 133
 
00:56:08.829 --> 00:56:08.839 align:start position:0%
right for this one the only the concern
 
00:56:10.789 --> 00:56:10.799 align:start position:0%
that I have is that ballot clerks do not
 
00:56:12.710 --> 00:56:12.720 align:start position:0%
under law have access to the Statewide
 
00:56:16.470 --> 00:56:16.480 align:start position:0%
voter registration system so if somebody
 
00:56:18.390 --> 00:56:18.400 align:start position:0%
did check in with an out ofate driver's
 
00:56:20.990 --> 00:56:21.000 align:start position:0%
license or attempted to then they would
 
00:56:21.000 --> 00:56:22.430 align:start position:0%
license or attempted to then they would
have

00:56:22.430 --> 00:56:22.440 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:56:25.470 --> 00:56:25.480 align:start position:0%
to we either need to change our
 
00:56:28.230 --> 00:56:28.240 align:start position:0%
reporting on our checklist to identify
 
00:56:30.750 --> 00:56:30.760 align:start position:0%
that that person had previously checked
 
00:56:33.470 --> 00:56:33.480 align:start position:0%
in with an outstate driver's license um
 
00:56:35.510 --> 00:56:35.520 align:start position:0%
which would be system changes and
 
00:56:38.309 --> 00:56:38.319 align:start position:0%
possibly a longer checklist or we would
 
00:56:40.470 --> 00:56:40.480 align:start position:0%
then have to send that person to the
 
00:56:43.510 --> 00:56:43.520 align:start position:0%
supervisors of the checklist um so
 
00:56:44.990 --> 00:56:45.000 align:start position:0%
similar to the bill that you were just
 
00:56:48.109 --> 00:56:48.119 align:start position:0%
talking about um there would create
 
00:56:50.710 --> 00:56:50.720 align:start position:0%
longer lines um and a little bit more
 
00:56:52.950 --> 00:56:52.960 align:start position:0%
chaos at check-in because somebody has
 
00:56:55.710 --> 00:56:55.720 align:start position:0%
to go to supervisors who who do have
 
00:56:57.750 --> 00:56:57.760 align:start position:0%
access they would have to supervisors
 
00:56:59.309 --> 00:56:59.319 align:start position:0%
would have to look up to see if they
 
00:57:01.990 --> 00:57:02.000 align:start position:0%
used one previously in the in the state
 
00:57:05.910 --> 00:57:05.920 align:start position:0%
svrs system however not every supervisor
 
00:57:09.150 --> 00:57:09.160 align:start position:0%
has access on Election Day to the
 
00:57:11.549 --> 00:57:11.559 align:start position:0%
registration system just because of
 
00:57:12.990 --> 00:57:13.000 align:start position:0%
different constraints in our polling
 
00:57:16.029 --> 00:57:16.039 align:start position:0%
locations including Wi-Fi and system
 
00:57:16.039 --> 00:57:18.670 align:start position:0%
locations including Wi-Fi and system
access

00:57:18.670 --> 00:57:18.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:26.670 --> 00:57:26.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:32.430 --> 00:57:32.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:32.440 --> 00:57:34.510 align:start position:0%
 
those

00:57:34.510 --> 00:57:34.520 align:start position:0%
those
 
00:57:37.430 --> 00:57:37.440 align:start position:0%
um that currently the Secretary of
 
00:57:40.069 --> 00:57:40.079 align:start position:0%
State's office has that list of Voters
 
00:57:43.589 --> 00:57:43.599 align:start position:0%
who voted using out of state licenses
 
00:57:46.390 --> 00:57:46.400 align:start position:0%
that that's correct right yes so when on
 
00:57:49.589 --> 00:57:49.599 align:start position:0%
on on Election Day if a voter checks in
 
00:57:51.789 --> 00:57:51.799 align:start position:0%
using an outer state driver's license
 
00:57:54.589 --> 00:57:54.599 align:start position:0%
they are the the ballot clerk either on
 
00:57:56.990 --> 00:57:57.000 align:start position:0%
the paper checklist or um through the
 
00:57:59.029 --> 00:57:59.039 align:start position:0%
pole pad checking process and then
 
00:58:00.750 --> 00:58:00.760 align:start position:0%
ultimately through the p on the
 
00:58:03.510 --> 00:58:03.520 align:start position:0%
papercheck list must put the two um
 
00:58:06.309 --> 00:58:06.319 align:start position:0%
letter initials of the state that um
 
00:58:09.910 --> 00:58:09.920 align:start position:0%
somebody checks in so if I am from just
 
00:58:11.510 --> 00:58:11.520 align:start position:0%
moved here from Massachusetts I haven't
 
00:58:12.750 --> 00:58:12.760 align:start position:0%
gotten my driver's New Hampshire
 
00:58:14.670 --> 00:58:14.680 align:start position:0%
driver's license yet I use it to check
 
00:58:17.029 --> 00:58:17.039 align:start position:0%
in to prove my identity and to receive
 
00:58:21.270 --> 00:58:21.280 align:start position:0%
my ballot um they will put Ma on the
 
00:58:24.069 --> 00:58:24.079 align:start position:0%
checklist and that would be then
 
00:58:25.670 --> 00:58:25.680 align:start position:0%
uploaded into the Statewide voted
 
00:58:25.680 --> 00:58:29.750 align:start position:0%
uploaded into the Statewide voted
registration

00:58:29.750 --> 00:58:29.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:32.630 --> 00:58:32.640 align:start position:0%
system would the Statewide voter
 
00:58:34.950 --> 00:58:34.960 align:start position:0%
registration system have the capability
 
00:58:40.230 --> 00:58:40.240 align:start position:0%
to identify on a town or city Ward
 
00:58:43.029 --> 00:58:43.039 align:start position:0%
level out of state voters who voted
 
00:58:43.039 --> 00:58:44.349 align:start position:0%
level out of state voters who voted
there

00:58:44.349 --> 00:58:44.359 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:58:46.710 --> 00:58:46.720 align:start position:0%
previously so that thanks for the
 
00:58:49.390 --> 00:58:49.400 align:start position:0%
question the that's what I would have to
 
00:58:51.990 --> 00:58:52.000 align:start position:0%
say is that we would need to change the
 
00:58:55.309 --> 00:58:55.319 align:start position:0%
report that we do for a checklist on
 
00:58:57.230 --> 00:58:57.240 align:start position:0%
Election Day
 
00:59:00.150 --> 00:59:00.160 align:start position:0%
um and then which would be a system
 
00:59:05.029 --> 00:59:05.039 align:start position:0%
change with a cost related and then the
 
00:59:06.670 --> 00:59:06.680 align:start position:0%
more information that we put on the
 
00:59:08.829 --> 00:59:08.839 align:start position:0%
checklist the longer the checklist gets
 
00:59:10.990 --> 00:59:11.000 align:start position:0%
so we were just looking at a bill that's
 
00:59:12.750 --> 00:59:12.760 align:start position:0%
coming up this week that you're going to
 
00:59:15.750 --> 00:59:15.760 align:start position:0%
hear that requires more information
 
00:59:18.270 --> 00:59:18.280 align:start position:0%
right Al dealing in that same section on
 
00:59:21.910 --> 00:59:21.920 align:start position:0%
the checklist um and our our take is
 
00:59:25.109 --> 00:59:25.119 align:start position:0%
that um if we put more information right
 
00:59:27.309 --> 00:59:27.319 align:start position:0%
in that spot we would have to add
 
00:59:30.470 --> 00:59:30.480 align:start position:0%
another line for each voter which if you
 
00:59:32.910 --> 00:59:32.920 align:start position:0%
have A500 page checklist now you have a
 
00:59:36.349 --> 00:59:36.359 align:start position:0%
3,000 page check list so yes we can do
 
00:59:38.510 --> 00:59:38.520 align:start position:0%
it it there's just some things to
 
00:59:45.470 --> 00:59:45.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:51.549 --> 00:59:51.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:51.559 --> 00:59:53.150 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:59:53.150 --> 00:59:53.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:59:56.510 --> 00:59:56.520 align:start position:0%
it do you do you know
 
00:59:58.430 --> 00:59:58.440 align:start position:0%
would the Secretary of State's office be
 
01:00:01.510 --> 01:00:01.520 align:start position:0%
able to supply this subcommittee some
 
01:00:04.470 --> 01:00:04.480 align:start position:0%
metrics around this for example could
 
01:00:05.829 --> 01:00:05.839 align:start position:0%
you tell
 
01:00:08.549 --> 01:00:08.559 align:start position:0%
us the
 
01:00:12.750 --> 01:00:12.760 align:start position:0%
the number of out of state voters at any
 
01:00:15.750 --> 01:00:15.760 align:start position:0%
given Ward and you know what are the
 
01:00:18.549 --> 01:00:18.559 align:start position:0%
top I'm I'm sorry the term out of state
 
01:00:21.109 --> 01:00:21.119 align:start position:0%
voters there or out of sorry thank you
 
01:00:24.510 --> 01:00:24.520 align:start position:0%
sorry sorry thank that I appreciate your
 
01:00:29.230 --> 01:00:29.240 align:start position:0%
clarification there new some um uh
 
01:00:32.430 --> 01:00:32.440 align:start position:0%
perhaps a Freudian slip I don't know um
 
01:00:34.950 --> 01:00:34.960 align:start position:0%
is it is it possible to determine those
 
01:00:36.710 --> 01:00:36.720 align:start position:0%
who have voted in New Hampshire using an
 
01:00:40.510 --> 01:00:40.520 align:start position:0%
outof state driver's license and to tell
 
01:00:43.710 --> 01:00:43.720 align:start position:0%
us uh some metrics to provide some
 
01:00:46.510 --> 01:00:46.520 align:start position:0%
metrics around this you know did did I
 
01:00:48.950 --> 01:00:48.960 align:start position:0%
I'll pick on Hudson did Hudson have 10
 
01:00:52.829 --> 01:00:52.839 align:start position:0%
since I'm from Hudson did Hudson have
 
01:00:57.150 --> 01:00:57.160 align:start position:0%
10 uh voters who are CLA doile and
 
01:01:01.950 --> 01:01:01.960 align:start position:0%
Hudson who uh otherwise fulfilled all
 
01:01:04.549 --> 01:01:04.559 align:start position:0%
the criteria but used a out
 
01:01:07.829 --> 01:01:07.839 align:start position:0%
ofate driver's license for for that
 
01:01:11.150 --> 01:01:11.160 align:start position:0%
purpose in the last election I believe
 
01:01:13.309 --> 01:01:13.319 align:start position:0%
we would be able to give you that I'd
 
01:01:15.789 --> 01:01:15.799 align:start position:0%
have to check um sometimes we're
 
01:01:17.990 --> 01:01:18.000 align:start position:0%
constrained on what information we can
 
01:01:20.069 --> 01:01:20.079 align:start position:0%
and cannot give and I don't know all the
 
01:01:22.789 --> 01:01:22.799 align:start position:0%
details behind that but um I will get
 
01:01:24.910 --> 01:01:24.920 align:start position:0%
back to on that and let you
 
01:01:28.549 --> 01:01:28.559 align:start position:0%
know would you like a an email from me
 
01:01:32.589 --> 01:01:32.599 align:start position:0%
as a formal request or sure I'll I'll
 
01:01:35.670 --> 01:01:35.680 align:start position:0%
try and word it nicely so that um that
 
01:01:39.910 --> 01:01:39.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:43.710 --> 01:01:43.720 align:start position:0%
um uh does the subcomittee I see um
 
01:01:45.589 --> 01:01:45.599 align:start position:0%
would that information about outof state
 
01:01:48.270 --> 01:01:48.280 align:start position:0%
driver's license usage be able to
 
01:01:52.510 --> 01:01:52.520 align:start position:0%
Encompass the um exceptions to requiring
 
01:01:54.990 --> 01:01:55.000 align:start position:0%
somebody to get a new driver's license
 
01:01:58.190 --> 01:01:58.200 align:start position:0%
for example if you come to New Hampshire
 
01:02:00.549 --> 01:02:00.559 align:start position:0%
and don't own a car I believe there's an
 
01:02:02.950 --> 01:02:02.960 align:start position:0%
exception to having to get a new
 
01:02:05.589 --> 01:02:05.599 align:start position:0%
driver's license would that information
 
01:02:07.549 --> 01:02:07.559 align:start position:0%
Encompass that where somebody wouldn't
 
01:02:07.559 --> 01:02:08.670 align:start position:0%
Encompass that where somebody wouldn't
be

01:02:08.670 --> 01:02:08.680 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:02:14.430 --> 01:02:14.440 align:start position:0%
required to get a new ID that way so our
 
01:02:16.349 --> 01:02:16.359 align:start position:0%
database does
 
01:02:21.230 --> 01:02:21.240 align:start position:0%
not have um DMV information on that or
 
01:02:26.549 --> 01:02:26.559 align:start position:0%
um car Registries um so no it will just
 
01:02:29.069 --> 01:02:29.079 align:start position:0%
give you information about who used an
 
01:02:31.829 --> 01:02:31.839 align:start position:0%
out of state out of state identification
 
01:02:39.190 --> 01:02:39.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:42.269 --> 01:02:42.279 align:start position:0%
ballot thank you for taking my question
 
01:02:45.510 --> 01:02:45.520 align:start position:0%
uh I was just wondering does the each
 
01:02:50.150 --> 01:02:50.160 align:start position:0%
town clerk get a list of people who used
 
01:02:51.910 --> 01:02:51.920 align:start position:0%
a u out
 
01:02:54.589 --> 01:02:54.599 align:start position:0%
ofate driver's license or
 
01:02:58.309 --> 01:02:58.319 align:start position:0%
ID uh you said it indicated the initials
 
01:03:01.750 --> 01:03:01.760 align:start position:0%
for the state like ma or BT or something
 
01:03:05.829 --> 01:03:05.839 align:start position:0%
like that um or the supervisor checklist
 
01:03:07.269 --> 01:03:07.279 align:start position:0%
do they
 
01:03:10.150 --> 01:03:10.160 align:start position:0%
get do they have that information for
 
01:03:13.589 --> 01:03:13.599 align:start position:0%
each voter at the time of of the
 
01:03:16.190 --> 01:03:16.200 align:start position:0%
election thank you for the question so
 
01:03:18.069 --> 01:03:18.079 align:start position:0%
after an election the clerk will have
 
01:03:21.230 --> 01:03:21.240 align:start position:0%
the paper checklist and it will be on
 
01:03:23.910 --> 01:03:23.920 align:start position:0%
the paper checklist um so they do have
 
01:03:26.430 --> 01:03:26.440 align:start position:0%
that information uh it's just not
 
01:03:28.510 --> 01:03:28.520 align:start position:0%
summarized for
 
01:03:30.910 --> 01:03:30.920 align:start position:0%
them so you would have to flip through
 
01:03:34.710 --> 01:03:34.720 align:start position:0%
each of the pages to see um who voted
 
01:03:37.470 --> 01:03:37.480 align:start position:0%
you who checked in to vote using an out
 
01:03:42.390 --> 01:03:42.400 align:start position:0%
ofate ID okay uh as a followup um for
 
01:03:45.630 --> 01:03:45.640 align:start position:0%
the next election will the supervisor
 
01:03:48.670 --> 01:03:48.680 align:start position:0%
checklist know who used a announ state
 
01:03:51.950 --> 01:03:51.960 align:start position:0%
ID for the last
 
01:03:55.109 --> 01:03:55.119 align:start position:0%
election um there is no law requiring
 
01:03:58.630 --> 01:03:58.640 align:start position:0%
the supervisor ERS to look to see how a
 
01:04:02.630 --> 01:04:02.640 align:start position:0%
voter previously checked in to vote or
 
01:04:05.789 --> 01:04:05.799 align:start position:0%
what there's no there's no look back
 
01:04:09.549 --> 01:04:09.559 align:start position:0%
requirement like this this legislation
 
01:04:13.670 --> 01:04:13.680 align:start position:0%
proposes so the the the supervisor
 
01:04:15.829 --> 01:04:15.839 align:start position:0%
checklist do not have the information or
 
01:04:18.950 --> 01:04:18.960 align:start position:0%
they're just not looking for
 
01:04:22.109 --> 01:04:22.119 align:start position:0%
it I will say that they
 
01:04:24.309 --> 01:04:24.319 align:start position:0%
um they are
 
01:04:29.510 --> 01:04:29.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:32.309 --> 01:04:32.319 align:start position:0%
it and if they were to look for it
 
01:04:34.710 --> 01:04:34.720 align:start position:0%
there's nothing in law that allows them
 
01:04:36.789 --> 01:04:36.799 align:start position:0%
to do anything with that information
 
01:04:38.829 --> 01:04:38.839 align:start position:0%
does that make sense like they are
 
01:04:40.710 --> 01:04:40.720 align:start position:0%
they're not on law
 
01:04:43.589 --> 01:04:43.599 align:start position:0%
enforcement the only the DMV would be
 
01:04:43.599 --> 01:04:45.029 align:start position:0%
enforcement the only the DMV would be
the

01:04:45.029 --> 01:04:45.039 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:04:47.829 --> 01:04:47.839 align:start position:0%
only well I can't say I'm not a lawyer
 
01:04:49.990 --> 01:04:50.000 align:start position:0%
and I'm not law so I can't say what the
 
01:04:52.910 --> 01:04:52.920 align:start position:0%
DMV or the department of sa safety does
 
01:04:55.309 --> 01:04:55.319 align:start position:0%
if somebody has an out ofate driver's
 
01:04:57.990 --> 01:04:58.000 align:start position:0%
license beyond the I think it's 60 days
 
01:05:01.069 --> 01:05:01.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:03.390 --> 01:05:03.400 align:start position:0%
to okay
 
01:05:06.190 --> 01:05:06.200 align:start position:0%
uh for this particular bill then is
 
01:05:09.269 --> 01:05:09.279 align:start position:0%
there no way that the uh that this could
 
01:05:13.829 --> 01:05:13.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:17.789 --> 01:05:17.799 align:start position:0%
now I will say that I think
 
01:05:22.990 --> 01:05:23.000 align:start position:0%
um HB if it if HB 133 is the correct I
 
01:05:25.710 --> 01:05:25.720 align:start position:0%
think that would be the better way to go
 
01:05:28.470 --> 01:05:28.480 align:start position:0%
to Pro to require somebody to get a New
 
01:05:30.710 --> 01:05:30.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire driver's license um when they
 
01:05:32.470 --> 01:05:32.480 align:start position:0%
meet the criteria of having to get a New
 
01:05:33.750 --> 01:05:33.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire driver's license when they
 
01:05:36.309 --> 01:05:36.319 align:start position:0%
move to New Hampshire um only because
 
01:05:37.789 --> 01:05:37.799 align:start position:0%
that would put in the department of
 
01:05:40.549 --> 01:05:40.559 align:start position:0%
safety's um wheelhouse when the law
 
01:05:44.750 --> 01:05:44.760 align:start position:0%
enforcement um side of New Hampshire
 
01:05:48.829 --> 01:05:48.839 align:start position:0%
rather than in um an election officials
 
01:05:53.309 --> 01:05:53.319 align:start position:0%
Arena where they are not a um somebody
 
01:05:57.549 --> 01:05:57.559 align:start position:0%
who has the would say capacity on
 
01:06:02.309 --> 01:06:02.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:05.990 --> 01:06:06.000 align:start position:0%
um under law is not required to enforce
 
01:06:09.589 --> 01:06:09.599 align:start position:0%
a department of safety
 
01:06:12.630 --> 01:06:12.640 align:start position:0%
law all right well then there's another
 
01:06:15.150 --> 01:06:15.160 align:start position:0%
bill that uh just requires a total ban
 
01:06:17.549 --> 01:06:17.559 align:start position:0%
on the use of an out ofate ID so that
 
01:06:22.910 --> 01:06:22.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:33.549 --> 01:06:33.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:36.510 --> 01:06:36.520 align:start position:0%
okay hi thank you for taking my question
 
01:06:40.269 --> 01:06:40.279 align:start position:0%
I so it does say that the um ballot
 
01:06:44.789 --> 01:06:44.799 align:start position:0%
clerk needs to change um change the
 
01:06:47.190 --> 01:06:47.200 align:start position:0%
address in red when they're checking in
 
01:06:48.750 --> 01:06:48.760 align:start position:0%
with an out of state they're making a
 
01:06:51.190 --> 01:06:51.200 align:start position:0%
notation that it's an out of state on
 
01:06:51.200 --> 01:06:51.870 align:start position:0%
notation that it's an out of state on
that

01:06:51.870 --> 01:06:51.880 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:06:54.870 --> 01:06:54.880 align:start position:0%
checklist so is it the supervisor of the
 
01:06:57.190 --> 01:06:57.200 align:start position:0%
checklist responsibility
 
01:07:01.230 --> 01:07:01.240 align:start position:0%
to have that on the next checklist is or
 
01:07:03.349 --> 01:07:03.359 align:start position:0%
is this that doesn't go anywhere I I
 
01:07:06.230 --> 01:07:06.240 align:start position:0%
guess I'm a little confused thank you
 
01:07:09.069 --> 01:07:09.079 align:start position:0%
the checklist um for an election that's
 
01:07:11.670 --> 01:07:11.680 align:start position:0%
printed out shows the the registered
 
01:07:14.670 --> 01:07:14.680 align:start position:0%
voter's name and it shows their address
 
01:07:17.670 --> 01:07:17.680 align:start position:0%
which they've proven to get on
 
01:07:21.990 --> 01:07:22.000 align:start position:0%
to um the checklist under current law it
 
01:07:24.589 --> 01:07:24.599 align:start position:0%
would be a physical piece of paper or a
 
01:07:27.150 --> 01:07:27.160 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire drivers license um under
 
01:07:28.710 --> 01:07:28.720 align:start position:0%
previous law they could have used an
 
01:07:33.190 --> 01:07:33.200 align:start position:0%
affidavit to attest to that domicile so
 
01:07:34.710 --> 01:07:34.720 align:start position:0%
it'll show the domicile of where they
 
01:07:37.589 --> 01:07:37.599 align:start position:0%
live but it will not show how many times
 
01:07:39.309 --> 01:07:39.319 align:start position:0%
they used an out ofate driver's license
 
01:07:45.029 --> 01:07:45.039 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:50.430 --> 01:07:50.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:54.029 --> 01:07:54.039 align:start position:0%
qualifications uh thank you uh if I may
 
01:07:57.870 --> 01:07:57.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:01.670 --> 01:08:01.680 align:start position:0%
is um is it
 
01:08:04.549 --> 01:08:04.559 align:start position:0%
possible or or do you would you foresee
 
01:08:08.430 --> 01:08:08.440 align:start position:0%
any problems if the Secretary of State's
 
01:08:10.789 --> 01:08:10.799 align:start position:0%
office provided to the supervisors of
 
01:08:13.150 --> 01:08:13.160 align:start position:0%
the checklist kind of a separate form
 
01:08:15.269 --> 01:08:15.279 align:start position:0%
that would be able to capture outof
 
01:08:18.590 --> 01:08:18.600 align:start position:0%
state driver's licenses for
 
01:08:18.600 --> 01:08:21.070 align:start position:0%
state driver's licenses for
easier

01:08:21.070 --> 01:08:21.080 align:start position:0%
easier
 
01:08:24.110 --> 01:08:24.120 align:start position:0%
um check-in process during the
 
01:08:27.590 --> 01:08:27.600 align:start position:0%
registration on voter day and then uh
 
01:08:29.910 --> 01:08:29.920 align:start position:0%
per the proposed Bill a look back
 
01:08:31.910 --> 01:08:31.920 align:start position:0%
process as
 
01:08:34.269 --> 01:08:34.279 align:start position:0%
well thank you for the question I think
 
01:08:36.829 --> 01:08:36.839 align:start position:0%
adding another piece of paper or another
 
01:08:40.030 --> 01:08:40.040 align:start position:0%
separate checklist that maybe have to be
 
01:08:41.950 --> 01:08:41.960 align:start position:0%
used in the same day would be more
 
01:08:44.149 --> 01:08:44.159 align:start position:0%
complicated so if you're going to
 
01:08:48.070 --> 01:08:48.080 align:start position:0%
require um additional information on the
 
01:08:50.189 --> 01:08:50.199 align:start position:0%
checklist I would just say keep it to
 
01:08:53.070 --> 01:08:53.080 align:start position:0%
one checklist keep it to one one
 
01:08:55.269 --> 01:08:55.279 align:start position:0%
database that's printed out or one poll
 
01:08:56.950 --> 01:08:56.960 align:start position:0%
pack had checkin because if there's
 
01:08:58.950 --> 01:08:58.960 align:start position:0%
multiple things that somebody has to
 
01:09:02.829 --> 01:09:02.839 align:start position:0%
look at or fill out at the same time um
 
01:09:04.950 --> 01:09:04.960 align:start position:0%
humans are involved and you may have
 
01:09:07.709 --> 01:09:07.719 align:start position:0%
errors in making sure that they agree
 
01:09:11.749 --> 01:09:11.759 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:14.110 --> 01:09:14.120 align:start position:0%
other if I may just maybe I didn't
 
01:09:15.510 --> 01:09:15.520 align:start position:0%
understand your question no no no I I
 
01:09:17.749 --> 01:09:17.759 align:start position:0%
think it's good I think your answer was
 
01:09:22.149 --> 01:09:22.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:25.390 --> 01:09:25.400 align:start position:0%
um it is a it is a busy time during a
 
01:09:28.189 --> 01:09:28.199 align:start position:0%
election day and to when you are doing
 
01:09:30.870 --> 01:09:30.880 align:start position:0%
same day registration and you have
 
01:09:34.390 --> 01:09:34.400 align:start position:0%
multiple pieces of paper with which uh
 
01:09:35.669 --> 01:09:35.679 align:start position:0%
you must
 
01:09:39.110 --> 01:09:39.120 align:start position:0%
process a a large number of Voters you
 
01:09:41.430 --> 01:09:41.440 align:start position:0%
certainly want to minimize the
 
01:09:43.789 --> 01:09:43.799 align:start position:0%
challenges and difficulties that
 
01:09:45.870 --> 01:09:45.880 align:start position:0%
supervisor the checklist or moderators
 
01:09:47.669 --> 01:09:47.679 align:start position:0%
or other election officials have to deal
 
01:09:49.070 --> 01:09:49.080 align:start position:0%
with without a
 
01:09:49.080 --> 01:09:52.870 align:start position:0%
with without a
doubt

01:09:52.870 --> 01:09:52.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:56.229 --> 01:09:56.239 align:start position:0%
um it
 
01:09:59.070 --> 01:09:59.080 align:start position:0%
it's it would seem to me that if if a
 
01:09:59.080 --> 01:10:00.270 align:start position:0%
it's it would seem to me that if if a
person

01:10:00.270 --> 01:10:00.280 align:start position:0%
person
 
01:10:00.280 --> 01:10:02.830 align:start position:0%
person
is

01:10:02.830 --> 01:10:02.840 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:10:05.550 --> 01:10:05.560 align:start position:0%
presented if if an election official is
 
01:10:09.990 --> 01:10:10.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:14.189 --> 01:10:14.199 align:start position:0%
of out of uh of Voters who used an out I
 
01:10:16.750 --> 01:10:16.760 align:start position:0%
want to say this correctly um voters who
 
01:10:21.030 --> 01:10:21.040 align:start position:0%
used an outof state driver's license in
 
01:10:22.390 --> 01:10:22.400 align:start position:0%
a previous
 
01:10:25.950 --> 01:10:25.960 align:start position:0%
election a and that was limited to
 
01:10:25.960 --> 01:10:27.790 align:start position:0%
election a and that was limited to
that

01:10:27.790 --> 01:10:27.800 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:10:30.630 --> 01:10:30.640 align:start position:0%
particular town or city Ward or town
 
01:10:33.390 --> 01:10:33.400 align:start position:0%
Ward or what have you
 
01:10:36.030 --> 01:10:36.040 align:start position:0%
and there was some basic information
 
01:10:40.070 --> 01:10:40.080 align:start position:0%
about which state it came from and the
 
01:10:43.310 --> 01:10:43.320 align:start position:0%
the identification of the person and and
 
01:10:43.320 --> 01:10:44.470 align:start position:0%
the identification of the person and and
those

01:10:44.470 --> 01:10:44.480 align:start position:0%
those
 
01:10:44.480 --> 01:10:47.470 align:start position:0%
those
aspects

01:10:47.470 --> 01:10:47.480 align:start position:0%
aspects
 
01:10:47.480 --> 01:10:49.430 align:start position:0%
aspects
um

01:10:49.430 --> 01:10:49.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:10:53.229 --> 01:10:53.239 align:start position:0%
then it that shouldn't be too onerous a
 
01:10:55.350 --> 01:10:55.360 align:start position:0%
task again I'm assuming that there's not
 
01:10:57.910 --> 01:10:57.920 align:start position:0%
large number of these type of people but
 
01:11:00.750 --> 01:11:00.760 align:start position:0%
again if we need the metrics on
 
01:11:04.709 --> 01:11:04.719 align:start position:0%
that so my my question was I don't I
 
01:11:06.149 --> 01:11:06.159 align:start position:0%
don't think it sounds like it's too
 
01:11:07.550 --> 01:11:07.560 align:start position:0%
honorous a
 
01:11:09.790 --> 01:11:09.800 align:start position:0%
process well I guess I would I would
 
01:11:12.870 --> 01:11:12.880 align:start position:0%
just have to ask the supervisors are not
 
01:11:15.110 --> 01:11:15.120 align:start position:0%
the ones that check people in to vote so
 
01:11:19.030 --> 01:11:19.040 align:start position:0%
they would if we gave them a list that's
 
01:11:20.630 --> 01:11:20.640 align:start position:0%
the ballot clerks are the ones that
 
01:11:23.189 --> 01:11:23.199 align:start position:0%
check people in to vote and they look
 
01:11:23.199 --> 01:11:24.030 align:start position:0%
check people in to vote and they look
for

01:11:24.030 --> 01:11:24.040 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:11:28.110 --> 01:11:28.120 align:start position:0%
identity um the concern I have about
 
01:11:30.669 --> 01:11:30.679 align:start position:0%
excluding out ofate driver's
 
01:11:34.630 --> 01:11:34.640 align:start position:0%
license from checking in again um if
 
01:11:37.709 --> 01:11:37.719 align:start position:0%
somebody um if somebody's not required
 
01:11:39.910 --> 01:11:39.920 align:start position:0%
to get one for example if my father
 
01:11:43.590 --> 01:11:43.600 align:start position:0%
who's over 65 years old lives in
 
01:11:46.750 --> 01:11:46.760 align:start position:0%
Florida comes to live with me
 
01:11:51.510 --> 01:11:51.520 align:start position:0%
permanently please don't if you're
 
01:11:53.990 --> 01:11:54.000 align:start position:0%
listening um if he comes to live with me
 
01:11:55.550 --> 01:11:55.560 align:start position:0%
permanently he's not required requ ired
 
01:11:57.870 --> 01:11:57.880 align:start position:0%
to get a New Hampshire driver's license
 
01:12:01.030 --> 01:12:01.040 align:start position:0%
um he can if he's not driving he can use
 
01:12:04.470 --> 01:12:04.480 align:start position:0%
his expired Florida State driver's
 
01:12:07.470 --> 01:12:07.480 align:start position:0%
license um to prove his identity to go
 
01:12:09.270 --> 01:12:09.280 align:start position:0%
get a ballot as long as he's met his
 
01:12:11.950 --> 01:12:11.960 align:start position:0%
other qualifications to prove domicile
 
01:12:13.830 --> 01:12:13.840 align:start position:0%
his age and his
 
01:12:16.910 --> 01:12:16.920 align:start position:0%
citizenship so we
 
01:12:20.430 --> 01:12:20.440 align:start position:0%
could definitely add an extra space on
 
01:12:22.270 --> 01:12:22.280 align:start position:0%
the checklist the checklist may get a
 
01:12:25.189 --> 01:12:25.199 align:start position:0%
little longer notifying a ballot Clerk
 
01:12:26.750 --> 01:12:26.760 align:start position:0%
that they've previously used an out
 
01:12:31.189 --> 01:12:31.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:36.870 --> 01:12:36.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:39.830 --> 01:12:39.840 align:start position:0%
for so I could see in those
 
01:12:42.270 --> 01:12:42.280 align:start position:0%
circumstances so in thank thank you for
 
01:12:44.709 --> 01:12:44.719 align:start position:0%
that response uh that that is a
 
01:12:47.070 --> 01:12:47.080 align:start position:0%
important aspect that we need to make
 
01:12:51.350 --> 01:12:51.360 align:start position:0%
sure we address in this process um
 
01:12:54.110 --> 01:12:54.120 align:start position:0%
would uh a person meeting the criteria
 
01:12:55.990 --> 01:12:56.000 align:start position:0%
that you described
 
01:12:59.070 --> 01:12:59.080 align:start position:0%
um maybe not directly related to you be
 
01:13:03.390 --> 01:13:03.400 align:start position:0%
able uh for your sake uh be able to uh
 
01:13:05.709 --> 01:13:05.719 align:start position:0%
obtain a non-driver identification from
 
01:13:05.719 --> 01:13:06.750 align:start position:0%
obtain a non-driver identification from
New

01:13:06.750 --> 01:13:06.760 align:start position:0%
New
 
01:13:10.229 --> 01:13:10.239 align:start position:0%
Hampshire yes is that
 
01:13:14.550 --> 01:13:14.560 align:start position:0%
process extraordinarily difficult or I I
 
01:13:16.110 --> 01:13:16.120 align:start position:0%
don't believe it's difficult I think
 
01:13:18.790 --> 01:13:18.800 align:start position:0%
it's it's going to the DMV to get that
 
01:13:28.910 --> 01:13:28.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:28.920 --> 01:13:30.070 align:start position:0%
 
representative

01:13:30.070 --> 01:13:30.080 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:13:35.430 --> 01:13:35.440 align:start position:0%
bernham thank you um do we know how many
 
01:13:38.350 --> 01:13:38.360 align:start position:0%
um out of state licenses are used each
 
01:13:40.950 --> 01:13:40.960 align:start position:0%
election do we have an idea I I think
 
01:13:43.189 --> 01:13:43.199 align:start position:0%
that's the report that um the chairman
 
01:13:45.350 --> 01:13:45.360 align:start position:0%
wanted me to get and I I will see if I
 
01:13:46.790 --> 01:13:46.800 align:start position:0%
can get that I don't think there's
 
01:13:48.390 --> 01:13:48.400 align:start position:0%
restrictions around that type of
 
01:13:50.830 --> 01:13:50.840 align:start position:0%
reporting since it's public checklist
 
01:13:53.910 --> 01:13:53.920 align:start position:0%
information so but I will see if I can
 
01:13:55.990 --> 01:13:56.000 align:start position:0%
get that for you
 
01:13:58.709 --> 01:13:58.719 align:start position:0%
thank you okay and and then just another
 
01:14:01.550 --> 01:14:01.560 align:start position:0%
one question here so depending on the
 
01:14:03.910 --> 01:14:03.920 align:start position:0%
frequency of how many outof state
 
01:14:05.870 --> 01:14:05.880 align:start position:0%
licenses are used for
 
01:14:07.629 --> 01:14:07.639 align:start position:0%
identification do you think it would
 
01:14:09.910 --> 01:14:09.920 align:start position:0%
really double the checklist or maybe
 
01:14:12.550 --> 01:14:12.560 align:start position:0%
just a page or
 
01:14:15.709 --> 01:14:15.719 align:start position:0%
so I would I would have to wait to give
 
01:14:18.189 --> 01:14:18.199 align:start position:0%
you that information and also figure out
 
01:14:20.390 --> 01:14:20.400 align:start position:0%
what the programming is because if if
 
01:14:23.149 --> 01:14:23.159 align:start position:0%
it's a if it's a line if it's a field
 
01:14:25.470 --> 01:14:25.480 align:start position:0%
where it's either filled or not fill for
 
01:14:25.480 --> 01:14:27.270 align:start position:0%
where it's either filled or not fill for
every

01:14:27.270 --> 01:14:27.280 align:start position:0%
every
 
01:14:29.590 --> 01:14:29.600 align:start position:0%
voter then it would be a field for every
 
01:14:31.870 --> 01:14:31.880 align:start position:0%
voter which would add space to the
 
01:14:33.830 --> 01:14:33.840 align:start position:0%
checklist but again I can't tell you
 
01:14:36.470 --> 01:14:36.480 align:start position:0%
that for sure unless we've programmed it
 
01:14:38.229 --> 01:14:38.239 align:start position:0%
to figure out exactly what you're
 
01:14:40.390 --> 01:14:40.400 align:start position:0%
looking for and how much space that
 
01:14:45.189 --> 01:14:45.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:50.590 --> 01:14:50.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:53.790 --> 01:14:53.800 align:start position:0%
uh yeah I I I'm I'm trying to think
 
01:14:56.830 --> 01:14:56.840 align:start position:0%
having done some programming myself um
 
01:15:00.870 --> 01:15:00.880 align:start position:0%
being an engineer uh I under understand
 
01:15:02.830 --> 01:15:02.840 align:start position:0%
that if those were not in the initial
 
01:15:07.350 --> 01:15:07.360 align:start position:0%
requirements um you know a new space is
 
01:15:09.390 --> 01:15:09.400 align:start position:0%
sometimes uh interesting challenge for
 
01:15:12.830 --> 01:15:12.840 align:start position:0%
databases and things like that
 
01:15:18.350 --> 01:15:18.360 align:start position:0%
so if um so we when you're registering
 
01:15:21.390 --> 01:15:21.400 align:start position:0%
in state when you're registering voters
 
01:15:23.510 --> 01:15:23.520 align:start position:0%
who already have a New
 
01:15:26.870 --> 01:15:26.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I identification a driver's
 
01:15:26.880 --> 01:15:30.350 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I identification a driver's
license

01:15:30.350 --> 01:15:30.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:33.790 --> 01:15:33.800 align:start position:0%
um when they C they're they're capturing
 
01:15:36.510 --> 01:15:36.520 align:start position:0%
the state at that point or do they is
 
01:15:39.229 --> 01:15:39.239 align:start position:0%
that is it just assumed to be New
 
01:15:41.390 --> 01:15:41.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so I think we're conflating
 
01:15:43.149 --> 01:15:43.159 align:start position:0%
two different things registration and
 
01:15:46.790 --> 01:15:46.800 align:start position:0%
voter checkin and this
 
01:15:49.430 --> 01:15:49.440 align:start position:0%
bill is obtaining a ballot so that's
 
01:15:51.430 --> 01:15:51.440 align:start position:0%
voter checkin versus
 
01:15:58.870 --> 01:15:58.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:00.510 --> 01:16:00.520 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
01:16:02.990 --> 01:16:03.000 align:start position:0%
yeah and there and the questions just
 
01:16:05.870 --> 01:16:05.880 align:start position:0%
keep on coming so uh representative Nome
 
01:16:07.229 --> 01:16:07.239 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:16:10.189 --> 01:16:10.199 align:start position:0%
um is it fair to summarize this as
 
01:16:12.310 --> 01:16:12.320 align:start position:0%
saying that this bill would
 
01:16:17.629 --> 01:16:17.639 align:start position:0%
create a for a violation of DMV regs the
 
01:16:20.229 --> 01:16:20.239 align:start position:0%
penalty for that would be a loss of
 
01:16:28.669 --> 01:16:28.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:31.270 --> 01:16:31.280 align:start position:0%
I don't think I can answer that question
 
01:16:36.310 --> 01:16:36.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:39.830 --> 01:16:39.840 align:start position:0%
sorry um I just I wanted to go back to
 
01:16:42.669 --> 01:16:42.679 align:start position:0%
your comment oh I'm okay I want I wanted
 
01:16:45.950 --> 01:16:45.960 align:start position:0%
to go back to your comment about um the
 
01:16:47.790 --> 01:16:47.800 align:start position:0%
out of state driver's license for those
 
01:16:47.800 --> 01:16:48.550 align:start position:0%
out of state driver's license for those
who

01:16:48.550 --> 01:16:48.560 align:start position:0%
who
 
01:16:53.669 --> 01:16:53.679 align:start position:0%
don't um who don't drive here and um I
 
01:16:57.310 --> 01:16:57.320 align:start position:0%
think we heard testimony um I think it
 
01:17:00.229 --> 01:17:00.239 align:start position:0%
was from uh uh Olivia zinc from open
 
01:17:02.590 --> 01:17:02.600 align:start position:0%
democracy on a personal level about
 
01:17:06.430 --> 01:17:06.440 align:start position:0%
taking somebody um who was 92 years old
 
01:17:09.189 --> 01:17:09.199 align:start position:0%
uh lived you know in a wheelchair lived
 
01:17:12.110 --> 01:17:12.120 align:start position:0%
in a um if I'm not mistaken some kind of
 
01:17:16.470 --> 01:17:16.480 align:start position:0%
um uh nursing home or a care facility
 
01:17:19.669 --> 01:17:19.679 align:start position:0%
and so she would not be able to use her
 
01:17:21.470 --> 01:17:21.480 align:start position:0%
that driver's she's from Maine she had a
 
01:17:23.709 --> 01:17:23.719 align:start position:0%
main expired main she would not be able
 
01:17:28.750 --> 01:17:28.760 align:start position:0%
to use that more than once even though I
 
01:17:30.790 --> 01:17:30.800 align:start position:0%
mean and and maybe not for us going to
 
01:17:33.790 --> 01:17:33.800 align:start position:0%
DMV is hard but there's a lot of people
 
01:17:37.510 --> 01:17:37.520 align:start position:0%
going to DMV is hard um if you don't
 
01:17:38.350 --> 01:17:38.360 align:start position:0%
have a
 
01:17:40.709 --> 01:17:40.719 align:start position:0%
car you're not driving so you don't have
 
01:17:43.390 --> 01:17:43.400 align:start position:0%
a car to get there and and then you're
 
01:17:45.669 --> 01:17:45.679 align:start position:0%
and the other thing is it's not just
 
01:17:47.830 --> 01:17:47.840 align:start position:0%
there's a large population that going
 
01:17:49.990 --> 01:17:50.000 align:start position:0%
through and getting there and having
 
01:17:51.590 --> 01:17:51.600 align:start position:0%
maybe have to take a day off from work
 
01:17:54.950 --> 01:17:54.960 align:start position:0%
to do it it just doesn't seem right
 
01:17:58.470 --> 01:17:58.480 align:start position:0%
right and I guess it's not I guess my
 
01:18:03.149 --> 01:18:03.159 align:start position:0%
question you is and what other what
 
01:18:05.070 --> 01:18:05.080 align:start position:0%
other give me a
 
01:18:08.270 --> 01:18:08.280 align:start position:0%
minute we also heard about yukaba voter
 
01:18:11.030 --> 01:18:11.040 align:start position:0%
not yukaba but military family military
 
01:18:14.510 --> 01:18:14.520 align:start position:0%
don't need to have an instate license
 
01:18:16.149 --> 01:18:16.159 align:start position:0%
how do you handle
 
01:18:19.550 --> 01:18:19.560 align:start position:0%
that um with your reports if there're a
 
01:18:20.990 --> 01:18:21.000 align:start position:0%
if they're a military person and they
 
01:18:22.870 --> 01:18:22.880 align:start position:0%
come in with do they get marked down as
 
01:18:28.149 --> 01:18:28.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:29.709 --> 01:18:29.719 align:start position:0%
that's a good question I don't know what
 
01:18:32.990 --> 01:18:33.000 align:start position:0%
they would present as for identity they
 
01:18:35.310 --> 01:18:35.320 align:start position:0%
may be presenting a military ID and
 
01:18:38.390 --> 01:18:38.400 align:start position:0%
again this is not this is not ID to show
 
01:18:40.750 --> 01:18:40.760 align:start position:0%
domicile it's ID to show identity so
 
01:18:42.390 --> 01:18:42.400 align:start position:0%
they could be showing a government
 
01:18:44.870 --> 01:18:44.880 align:start position:0%
issued military ID with their picture on
 
01:18:44.880 --> 01:18:49.750 align:start position:0%
issued military ID with their picture on
it

01:18:49.750 --> 01:18:49.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:52.229 --> 01:18:52.239 align:start position:0%
um hypotheticals I'm not very good with
 
01:18:53.750 --> 01:18:53.760 align:start position:0%
because I come with up with lots of
 
01:18:56.830 --> 01:18:56.840 align:start position:0%
different options for you it yeah no I I
 
01:18:59.910 --> 01:18:59.920 align:start position:0%
get it now I just I was wandering under
 
01:19:01.550 --> 01:19:01.560 align:start position:0%
this bill and that's not really for you
 
01:19:03.750 --> 01:19:03.760 align:start position:0%
to answer but that it's a good point it
 
01:19:11.270 --> 01:19:11.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:15.910 --> 01:19:15.920 align:start position:0%
thanks representative C uh yes um just
 
01:19:19.750 --> 01:19:19.760 align:start position:0%
to uh follow up on all
 
01:19:23.350 --> 01:19:23.360 align:start position:0%
this if somebody vote uh register same
 
01:19:26.470 --> 01:19:26.480 align:start position:0%
day voting they are then still
 
01:19:28.750 --> 01:19:28.760 align:start position:0%
registered for the next
 
01:19:32.310 --> 01:19:32.320 align:start position:0%
elections yes okay so if this bill were
 
01:19:32.320 --> 01:19:33.510 align:start position:0%
elections yes okay so if this bill were
changed

01:19:33.510 --> 01:19:33.520 align:start position:0%
changed
 
01:19:37.350 --> 01:19:37.360 align:start position:0%
to limit the U out ofate driver's
 
01:19:40.310 --> 01:19:40.320 align:start position:0%
license to same day
 
01:19:43.270 --> 01:19:43.280 align:start position:0%
registration and that the normal
 
01:19:46.149 --> 01:19:46.159 align:start position:0%
registration in in advance of an
 
01:19:49.590 --> 01:19:49.600 align:start position:0%
election would require an
 
01:19:52.709 --> 01:19:52.719 align:start position:0%
instate driver's license except for
 
01:19:59.310 --> 01:19:59.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:02.390 --> 01:20:02.400 align:start position:0%
work I would say again you have to look
 
01:20:05.510 --> 01:20:05.520 align:start position:0%
at DMV law which I'm not a lawyer nor do
 
01:20:08.430 --> 01:20:08.440 align:start position:0%
I work for Department of Safety
 
01:20:12.149 --> 01:20:12.159 align:start position:0%
but if I had just moved to New Hampshire
 
01:20:14.189 --> 01:20:14.199 align:start position:0%
and established my domicile a week
 
01:20:16.750 --> 01:20:16.760 align:start position:0%
before the election and did not get to
 
01:20:20.030 --> 01:20:20.040 align:start position:0%
the DMV yet to get a New Hampshire ID it
 
01:20:23.270 --> 01:20:23.280 align:start position:0%
is difficult sometimes to get a DMV
 
01:20:26.030 --> 01:20:26.040 align:start position:0%
appointment within a week
 
01:20:27.229 --> 01:20:27.239 align:start position:0%
I think you'd
 
01:20:30.510 --> 01:20:30.520 align:start position:0%
be not allowing somebody to vote be even
 
01:20:32.629 --> 01:20:32.639 align:start position:0%
though they would be
 
01:20:35.430 --> 01:20:35.440 align:start position:0%
qualified well as as I was trying to
 
01:20:37.510 --> 01:20:37.520 align:start position:0%
present it maybe I didn't word it very
 
01:20:41.709 --> 01:20:41.719 align:start position:0%
well um allowing same day registrant to
 
01:20:45.910 --> 01:20:45.920 align:start position:0%
use an outof state license okay or an
 
01:20:48.110 --> 01:20:48.120 align:start position:0%
instate if they have already taken care
 
01:20:51.590 --> 01:20:51.600 align:start position:0%
of it but for the normal registration
 
01:20:53.470 --> 01:20:53.480 align:start position:0%
period before the
 
01:20:56.149 --> 01:20:56.159 align:start position:0%
election the they would need to have the
 
01:20:56.159 --> 01:20:57.990 align:start position:0%
election the they would need to have the
proper

01:20:57.990 --> 01:20:58.000 align:start position:0%
proper
 
01:21:03.470 --> 01:21:03.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:06.270 --> 01:21:06.280 align:start position:0%
seniors I have to take this one back to
 
01:21:09.149 --> 01:21:09.159 align:start position:0%
my team on that
 
01:21:11.270 --> 01:21:11.280 align:start position:0%
um would that not be creating two
 
01:21:12.950 --> 01:21:12.960 align:start position:0%
different classes between seniors and
 
01:21:16.669 --> 01:21:16.679 align:start position:0%
non- seniors with what would be
 
01:21:19.149 --> 01:21:19.159 align:start position:0%
acceptable we always have at least two
 
01:21:21.350 --> 01:21:21.360 align:start position:0%
classes of Voters we got absentee voters
 
01:21:23.590 --> 01:21:23.600 align:start position:0%
and inperson voters we've got old voters
 
01:21:25.430 --> 01:21:25.440 align:start position:0%
we've got young voters
 
01:21:28.910 --> 01:21:28.920 align:start position:0%
um any any two combinations of words you
 
01:21:39.310 --> 01:21:39.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:41.950 --> 01:21:41.960 align:start position:0%
list I think if we can borrow from the
 
01:21:43.910 --> 01:21:43.920 align:start position:0%
American Disabilities Act we're we're
 
01:21:46.149 --> 01:21:46.159 align:start position:0%
trying to do reasonable accommodations
 
01:21:47.350 --> 01:21:47.360 align:start position:0%
for different
 
01:21:51.669 --> 01:21:51.679 align:start position:0%
scenarios um and so
 
01:21:56.550 --> 01:21:56.560 align:start position:0%
uh for those who are no longer driving
 
01:22:01.430 --> 01:22:01.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:04.830 --> 01:22:04.840 align:start position:0%
driving they would be required
 
01:22:07.990 --> 01:22:08.000 align:start position:0%
to get a new license wouldn't they with
 
01:22:10.110 --> 01:22:10.120 align:start position:0%
some exceptions out there for example if
 
01:22:11.510 --> 01:22:11.520 align:start position:0%
they don't have a car in the state they
 
01:22:13.750 --> 01:22:13.760 align:start position:0%
don't need to get
 
01:22:16.430 --> 01:22:16.440 align:start position:0%
one so if there are a student coming in
 
01:22:17.629 --> 01:22:17.639 align:start position:0%
from somewhere else and they don't have
 
01:22:20.470 --> 01:22:20.480 align:start position:0%
a car in this they don't bring a car
 
01:22:22.229 --> 01:22:22.239 align:start position:0%
with them which I'd be willing to bet
 
01:22:25.270 --> 01:22:25.280 align:start position:0%
most certainly freshmen especially
 
01:22:27.790 --> 01:22:27.800 align:start position:0%
um will not have cars if not most
 
01:22:30.149 --> 01:22:30.159 align:start position:0%
students generally or the Stu the car
 
01:22:31.870 --> 01:22:31.880 align:start position:0%
may they have may still be registered to
 
01:22:34.950 --> 01:22:34.960 align:start position:0%
their parents they would not be
 
01:22:37.270 --> 01:22:37.280 align:start position:0%
required to get a new driver's license
 
01:22:48.550 --> 01:22:48.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:51.189 --> 01:22:51.199 align:start position:0%
understanding we will probably have to
 
01:22:54.110 --> 01:22:54.120 align:start position:0%
uh take that up with with someone on the
 
01:22:56.229 --> 01:22:56.239 align:start position:0%
legal side because if
 
01:22:58.270 --> 01:22:58.280 align:start position:0%
they've as we've
 
01:23:02.030 --> 01:23:02.040 align:start position:0%
heard if they voted they've now declared
 
01:23:02.040 --> 01:23:03.470 align:start position:0%
heard if they voted they've now declared
their

01:23:03.470 --> 01:23:03.480 align:start position:0%
their
 
01:23:08.350 --> 01:23:08.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:11.990 --> 01:23:12.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and therefore they have to
 
01:23:14.750 --> 01:23:14.760 align:start position:0%
comply with the other applicable
 
01:23:14.760 --> 01:23:18.310 align:start position:0%
comply with the other applicable
laws

01:23:18.310 --> 01:23:18.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:20.590 --> 01:23:20.600 align:start position:0%
but which as they're currently written
 
01:23:23.430 --> 01:23:23.440 align:start position:0%
very well may not require that
 
01:23:25.750 --> 01:23:25.760 align:start position:0%
license so the solution may be over on
 
01:23:31.629 --> 01:23:31.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:35.070 --> 01:23:35.080 align:start position:0%
here but I but I agree that I think
 
01:23:38.790 --> 01:23:38.800 align:start position:0%
delving deeper into that aspect may be
 
01:23:42.110 --> 01:23:42.120 align:start position:0%
required and and I also think that if
 
01:23:44.870 --> 01:23:44.880 align:start position:0%
the ultimate goal is to deny them the
 
01:23:48.830 --> 01:23:48.840 align:start position:0%
ability to vote that's a severe penalty
 
01:23:50.149 --> 01:23:50.159 align:start position:0%
for just not
 
01:23:53.430 --> 01:23:53.440 align:start position:0%
getting a driver's
 
01:23:55.629 --> 01:23:55.639 align:start position:0%
license and I'm not sure it's
 
01:24:16.350 --> 01:24:16.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:19.310 --> 01:24:19.320 align:start position:0%
crime all right well there's obviously a
 
01:24:21.990 --> 01:24:22.000 align:start position:0%
few things to consider here um for this
 
01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:23.110 align:start position:0%
few things to consider here um for this
particular

01:24:23.110 --> 01:24:23.120 align:start position:0%
particular
 
01:24:28.430 --> 01:24:28.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:31.830 --> 01:24:31.840 align:start position:0%
and we need to make certain
 
01:24:35.790 --> 01:24:35.800 align:start position:0%
that uh the appropriate exceptions are
 
01:24:35.800 --> 01:24:38.550 align:start position:0%
that uh the appropriate exceptions are
accounted

01:24:38.550 --> 01:24:38.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:41.109 --> 01:24:41.119 align:start position:0%
for and you're right there maybe some
 
01:24:42.910 --> 01:24:42.920 align:start position:0%
other solutions that reside more in the
 
01:24:47.790 --> 01:24:47.800 align:start position:0%
DMV side of things than such as HB 133
 
01:24:48.950 --> 01:24:48.960 align:start position:0%
uh tried to
 
01:24:48.960 --> 01:24:51.910 align:start position:0%
uh tried to
address

01:24:51.910 --> 01:24:51.920 align:start position:0%
address
 
01:24:55.030 --> 01:24:55.040 align:start position:0%
um are there any uh fur further
 
01:24:55.040 --> 01:24:56.390 align:start position:0%
um are there any uh fur further
questions

01:24:56.390 --> 01:24:56.400 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:24:59.510 --> 01:24:59.520 align:start position:0%
for at on this particular
 
01:25:01.910 --> 01:25:01.920 align:start position:0%
Bill we let's give you a little break
 
01:25:04.669 --> 01:25:04.679 align:start position:0%
here perhap uh are there any other
 
01:25:07.870 --> 01:25:07.880 align:start position:0%
questions um at this
 
01:25:14.189 --> 01:25:14.199 align:start position:0%
point uh on uh 618 for deputy secretary
 
01:25:16.709 --> 01:25:16.719 align:start position:0%
Hennessy no I don't have a question for
 
01:25:19.470 --> 01:25:19.480 align:start position:0%
her right now but I have something I
 
01:25:24.750 --> 01:25:24.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:27.590 --> 01:25:27.600 align:start position:0%
so I have a mother who's recently had to
 
01:25:30.350 --> 01:25:30.360 align:start position:0%
move in with me that I have to care for
 
01:25:33.149 --> 01:25:33.159 align:start position:0%
and she requires care when I'm not home
 
01:25:35.990 --> 01:25:36.000 align:start position:0%
either which is challenging so uh and
 
01:25:38.790 --> 01:25:38.800 align:start position:0%
she's a voter her her mind is all there
 
01:25:42.470 --> 01:25:42.480 align:start position:0%
but her body is failing in movement so
 
01:25:49.229 --> 01:25:49.239 align:start position:0%
it was very challenging to um get her to
 
01:25:52.669 --> 01:25:52.679 align:start position:0%
her uh City Hall to get an absentee
 
01:25:55.629 --> 01:25:55.639 align:start position:0%
ballot physically for me it's a lot of
 
01:26:00.350 --> 01:26:00.360 align:start position:0%
work so looking forward I'm I'm and now
 
01:26:01.950 --> 01:26:01.960 align:start position:0%
that she's uh possibly going to be
 
01:26:03.950 --> 01:26:03.960 align:start position:0%
living with me permanently I think about
 
01:26:07.510 --> 01:26:07.520 align:start position:0%
how is she going to vote because I she
 
01:26:10.669 --> 01:26:10.679 align:start position:0%
wants to vote uh she'll be moving into
 
01:26:14.350 --> 01:26:14.360 align:start position:0%
my uh town so that that we' have to
 
01:26:15.990 --> 01:26:16.000 align:start position:0%
she'd have to
 
01:26:18.430 --> 01:26:18.440 align:start position:0%
change part of me wonders is there's
 
01:26:21.430 --> 01:26:21.440 align:start position:0%
something we can do with and and this is
 
01:26:24.510 --> 01:26:24.520 align:start position:0%
just a thought but it can we do
 
01:26:26.790 --> 01:26:26.800 align:start position:0%
something that is
 
01:26:29.189 --> 01:26:29.199 align:start position:0%
um she probably won't be able to
 
01:26:33.950 --> 01:26:33.960 align:start position:0%
physically go to vote um any longer so
 
01:26:35.669 --> 01:26:35.679 align:start position:0%
she'll probably do an absentee ballot
 
01:26:37.750 --> 01:26:37.760 align:start position:0%
but for those people who do want to go
 
01:26:39.750 --> 01:26:39.760 align:start position:0%
and have the proper assistance to do
 
01:26:42.990 --> 01:26:43.000 align:start position:0%
that is there can we have some kind of
 
01:26:45.430 --> 01:26:45.440 align:start position:0%
identification like at the town and City
 
01:26:47.629 --> 01:26:47.639 align:start position:0%
level where they can retrieve that to
 
01:26:50.470 --> 01:26:50.480 align:start position:0%
make that process just a thought I'm
 
01:26:53.109 --> 01:26:53.119 align:start position:0%
throwing out there versus DMV versus
 
01:26:55.350 --> 01:26:55.360 align:start position:0%
showing that they're living in a
 
01:26:58.270 --> 01:26:58.280 align:start position:0%
particular place with a or it say a
 
01:27:00.990 --> 01:27:01.000 align:start position:0%
college or School level as
 
01:27:05.229 --> 01:27:05.239 align:start position:0%
well that it's all the same yeah I mean
 
01:27:08.830 --> 01:27:08.840 align:start position:0%
it's I don't it's uh but it would be
 
01:27:10.550 --> 01:27:10.560 align:start position:0%
through the town or city that they
 
01:27:14.790 --> 01:27:14.800 align:start position:0%
reside in not through a school but
 
01:27:16.109 --> 01:27:16.119 align:start position:0%
through the town and city where they're
 
01:27:16.119 --> 01:27:17.669 align:start position:0%
through the town and city where they're
voting

01:27:17.669 --> 01:27:17.679 align:start position:0%
voting
 
01:27:20.109 --> 01:27:20.119 align:start position:0%
in is that I'm just throwing a thought
 
01:27:22.750 --> 01:27:22.760 align:start position:0%
I'm just trying to see where this
 
01:27:25.750 --> 01:27:25.760 align:start position:0%
information could be
 
01:27:30.070 --> 01:27:30.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:32.390 --> 01:27:32.400 align:start position:0%
processed without going through DMV in
 
01:27:34.870 --> 01:27:34.880 align:start position:0%
licensing the driver's license it's
 
01:27:36.870 --> 01:27:36.880 align:start position:0%
obviously like my mother is in driving
 
01:27:39.109 --> 01:27:39.119 align:start position:0%
and her license will expire and I'm not
 
01:27:40.709 --> 01:27:40.719 align:start position:0%
going to probably take her to DMB
 
01:27:42.310 --> 01:27:42.320 align:start position:0%
because it does take almost a month to
 
01:27:45.109 --> 01:27:45.119 align:start position:0%
even get an appointment so just kind of
 
01:27:47.030 --> 01:27:47.040 align:start position:0%
throwing that out there something to
 
01:27:49.229 --> 01:27:49.239 align:start position:0%
think about but anyway thank you
 
01:27:52.189 --> 01:27:52.199 align:start position:0%
something like a voter ID
 
01:27:54.629 --> 01:27:54.639 align:start position:0%
card I've seen that in other States I
 
01:27:56.030 --> 01:27:56.040 align:start position:0%
don't know that I've seen it in New
 
01:27:57.990 --> 01:27:58.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire could certainly be used for
 
01:28:00.070 --> 01:28:00.080 align:start position:0%
voter but it's also just an ID in
 
01:28:02.510 --> 01:28:02.520 align:start position:0%
general like this is VI the town that we
 
01:28:05.470 --> 01:28:05.480 align:start position:0%
reside in and here's my photo with that
 
01:28:08.149 --> 01:28:08.159 align:start position:0%
all that information captured in one and
 
01:28:10.510 --> 01:28:10.520 align:start position:0%
that could be definitely used for
 
01:28:12.830 --> 01:28:12.840 align:start position:0%
voter from that because you're voting in
 
01:28:15.830 --> 01:28:15.840 align:start position:0%
your town and City so why not have that
 
01:28:29.470 --> 01:28:29.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:33.470 --> 01:28:33.480 align:start position:0%
Mr O'Brien we welcome you again to uh
 
01:28:35.990 --> 01:28:36.000 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee for Testimony sorry
 
01:28:37.669 --> 01:28:37.679 align:start position:0%
thank you uh Mr chair again my name is
 
01:28:39.149 --> 01:28:39.159 align:start position:0%
Michael O'Brien with pry strategies on
 
01:28:41.590 --> 01:28:41.600 align:start position:0%
behalf of my client America votes um and
 
01:28:44.109 --> 01:28:44.119 align:start position:0%
just for you all I I know I'm around
 
01:28:47.070 --> 01:28:47.080 align:start position:0%
here a bit but um this is my 12th year
 
01:28:48.149 --> 01:28:48.159 align:start position:0%
sitting around the election law
 
01:28:51.310 --> 01:28:51.320 align:start position:0%
committee um in various hats and so been
 
01:28:54.229 --> 01:28:54.239 align:start position:0%
immersed in this for a long time um just
 
01:28:57.149 --> 01:28:57.159 align:start position:0%
quick on the 60-day uh piece the first
 
01:28:59.790 --> 01:28:59.800 align:start position:0%
time I interacted with this uh was when
 
01:29:01.990 --> 01:29:02.000 align:start position:0%
I had moved I lived in New Hampshire in
 
01:29:04.270 --> 01:29:04.280 align:start position:0%
an apartment we just bought our house um
 
01:29:08.070 --> 01:29:08.080 align:start position:0%
my wife was uh the theater director at
 
01:29:11.510 --> 01:29:11.520 align:start position:0%
um Wescom high school and I was driving
 
01:29:13.070 --> 01:29:13.080 align:start position:0%
home on a snowy night and thought that
 
01:29:14.709 --> 01:29:14.719 align:start position:0%
the breakdown Lane was a right-and lane
 
01:29:16.229 --> 01:29:16.239 align:start position:0%
and so took a right in the breakdown
 
01:29:18.669 --> 01:29:18.679 align:start position:0%
Lane and some lights flashed behind me
 
01:29:20.350 --> 01:29:20.360 align:start position:0%
uh and the police officer pull over and
 
01:29:21.709 --> 01:29:21.719 align:start position:0%
said do do know and I said oh I'm really
 
01:29:23.030 --> 01:29:23.040 align:start position:0%
sorry I mean I thought I legitimately
 
01:29:24.310 --> 01:29:24.320 align:start position:0%
thought it was a right-and lane that's
 
01:29:26.390 --> 01:29:26.400 align:start position:0%
what it was there for and he took he
 
01:29:27.709 --> 01:29:27.719 align:start position:0%
said you were from around here and I
 
01:29:29.350 --> 01:29:29.360 align:start position:0%
said no I I live I already give my
 
01:29:31.149 --> 01:29:31.159 align:start position:0%
address so what whatever uh I live in
 
01:29:32.870 --> 01:29:32.880 align:start position:0%
Auburn he said oh your license is
 
01:29:35.270 --> 01:29:35.280 align:start position:0%
Manchester and I said yes I haven't
 
01:29:37.229 --> 01:29:37.239 align:start position:0%
updated it yet and he said you know you
 
01:29:39.109 --> 01:29:39.119 align:start position:0%
have 60 days to do that so first I just
 
01:29:40.550 --> 01:29:40.560 align:start position:0%
want to be clear that it's not just out
 
01:29:42.390 --> 01:29:42.400 align:start position:0%
of state right if you move within State
 
01:29:44.750 --> 01:29:44.760 align:start position:0%
you have 60 days the penalty for that
 
01:29:47.109 --> 01:29:47.119 align:start position:0%
for me though he was nice to me and did
 
01:29:49.310 --> 01:29:49.320 align:start position:0%
and took Mercy would have been a ticket
 
01:29:50.709 --> 01:29:50.719 align:start position:0%
right I would have gotten a fine from
 
01:29:52.950 --> 01:29:52.960 align:start position:0%
the state for not following up with
 
01:29:55.709 --> 01:29:55.719 align:start position:0%
motor vehicle law um to emphasize the
 
01:29:59.629 --> 01:29:59.639 align:start position:0%
point going from a fine to not being
 
01:30:02.109 --> 01:30:02.119 align:start position:0%
able to vote is a is a pretty big jump
 
01:30:03.470 --> 01:30:03.480 align:start position:0%
the second thing I want to just
 
01:30:06.310 --> 01:30:06.320 align:start position:0%
reemphasize from my what I said earlier
 
01:30:07.870 --> 01:30:07.880 align:start position:0%
if I show up with an out of state
 
01:30:09.510 --> 01:30:09.520 align:start position:0%
license because I just moved to New
 
01:30:11.790 --> 01:30:11.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire it does not prove I live here
 
01:30:13.590 --> 01:30:13.600 align:start position:0%
right I need something else so I think
 
01:30:16.750 --> 01:30:16.760 align:start position:0%
we're once again conflating two things
 
01:30:19.149 --> 01:30:19.159 align:start position:0%
here that are very different one is
 
01:30:21.550 --> 01:30:21.560 align:start position:0%
proving who I am right if I had I'm from
 
01:30:23.750 --> 01:30:23.760 align:start position:0%
Rhode Island originally um I try to hide
 
01:30:25.669 --> 01:30:25.679 align:start position:0%
the accent as best I can every once in a
 
01:30:28.229 --> 01:30:28.239 align:start position:0%
while it slips out if I show up with a
 
01:30:31.070 --> 01:30:31.080 align:start position:0%
Rhode Island license it still proves Who
 
01:30:33.470 --> 01:30:33.480 align:start position:0%
I Am the end of the day it proves who I
 
01:30:35.990 --> 01:30:36.000 align:start position:0%
am I need something else if I have that
 
01:30:38.550 --> 01:30:38.560 align:start position:0%
R Island license to prove where I live
 
01:30:39.870 --> 01:30:39.880 align:start position:0%
and that it is in the state of New
 
01:30:41.790 --> 01:30:41.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and so I just don't want us to
 
01:30:43.350 --> 01:30:43.360 align:start position:0%
it feels like we're crossing this line
 
01:30:46.109 --> 01:30:46.119 align:start position:0%
again where we're saying we need to do
 
01:30:47.950 --> 01:30:47.960 align:start position:0%
an instate license because it's going to
 
01:30:50.830 --> 01:30:50.840 align:start position:0%
prove where I live except again I I will
 
01:30:52.709 --> 01:30:52.719 align:start position:0%
have to prove something else while I
 
01:30:56.149 --> 01:30:56.159 align:start position:0%
register um in order to do that so um
 
01:30:57.510 --> 01:30:57.520 align:start position:0%
and the last thing I just want to in
 
01:30:58.550 --> 01:30:58.560 align:start position:0%
addition to some of the things we've
 
01:31:01.270 --> 01:31:01.280 align:start position:0%
talked about um before we had to start
 
01:31:02.629 --> 01:31:02.639 align:start position:0%
scheduling our presidential primary
 
01:31:04.310 --> 01:31:04.320 align:start position:0%
earlier and earlier and earlier
 
01:31:05.750 --> 01:31:05.760 align:start position:0%
sometimes the presidential primary Falls
 
01:31:07.590 --> 01:31:07.600 align:start position:0%
within 60 days of the next election
 
01:31:09.590 --> 01:31:09.600 align:start position:0%
which will be for most residents of New
 
01:31:12.109 --> 01:31:12.119 align:start position:0%
Hampshire the March town meeting and so
 
01:31:14.030 --> 01:31:14.040 align:start position:0%
it is possible that I could vote in two
 
01:31:16.990 --> 01:31:17.000 align:start position:0%
elections in this state well within the
 
01:31:20.629 --> 01:31:20.639 align:start position:0%
60 days uh and not have yet violated
 
01:31:24.470 --> 01:31:24.480 align:start position:0%
motor vehicle law at all um and so when
 
01:31:26.070 --> 01:31:26.080 align:start position:0%
we put this sort of one election
 
01:31:28.910 --> 01:31:28.920 align:start position:0%
restriction you could also be there
 
01:31:30.109 --> 01:31:30.119 align:start position:0%
could be someone who was well within
 
01:31:31.310 --> 01:31:31.320 align:start position:0%
their rights to not have changed their
 
01:31:35.350 --> 01:31:35.360 align:start position:0%
ID yet um but is now hung up in this
 
01:31:36.790 --> 01:31:36.800 align:start position:0%
restriction so I just want to be clear
 
01:31:38.470 --> 01:31:38.480 align:start position:0%
about all those things and especially
 
01:31:41.109 --> 01:31:41.119 align:start position:0%
again identity is proved by license it
 
01:31:43.070 --> 01:31:43.080 align:start position:0%
can prove domicile but it does not have
 
01:31:45.229 --> 01:31:45.239 align:start position:0%
to and if it does not you must produce
 
01:31:47.070 --> 01:31:47.080 align:start position:0%
something else and so that's that's
 
01:31:49.870 --> 01:31:49.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:54.109 --> 01:31:54.119 align:start position:0%
have right so again um I think the less
 
01:31:56.350 --> 01:31:56.360 align:start position:0%
for today is you know there is
 
01:32:01.629 --> 01:32:01.639 align:start position:0%
registration and there is checkin and um
 
01:32:01.639 --> 01:32:02.510 align:start position:0%
registration and there is checkin and um
at

01:32:02.510 --> 01:32:02.520 align:start position:0%
at
 
01:32:05.510 --> 01:32:05.520 align:start position:0%
least the requirements to demonstrate
 
01:32:08.550 --> 01:32:08.560 align:start position:0%
either do not NE should not be
 
01:32:12.070 --> 01:32:12.080 align:start position:0%
conflated um it they are sometimes
 
01:32:14.910 --> 01:32:14.920 align:start position:0%
jumbled up for same day registration and
 
01:32:17.669 --> 01:32:17.679 align:start position:0%
other aspects like that but but we need
 
01:32:20.510 --> 01:32:20.520 align:start position:0%
to as a subcommittee make sure that we
 
01:32:26.229 --> 01:32:26.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:32.830 --> 01:32:32.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:36.229 --> 01:32:36.239 align:start position:0%
um we need make sure that that that we
 
01:32:39.990 --> 01:32:40.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:42.830 --> 01:32:42.840 align:start position:0%
these election circum I'm not sure I've
 
01:32:45.189 --> 01:32:45.199 align:start position:0%
I've remember hearing that in during the
 
01:32:48.149 --> 01:32:48.159 align:start position:0%
public testimony perhaps it was but
 
01:32:51.310 --> 01:32:51.320 align:start position:0%
the we need to make sure that if there's
 
01:32:54.070 --> 01:32:54.080 align:start position:0%
a local election and then a primary
 
01:32:57.030 --> 01:32:57.040 align:start position:0%
sometime in the you know within that
 
01:32:59.870 --> 01:32:59.880 align:start position:0%
period that people are still uh unable
 
01:33:03.070 --> 01:33:03.080 align:start position:0%
to vote I know you
 
01:33:06.109 --> 01:33:06.119 align:start position:0%
know so uh you you had further comment
 
01:33:07.030 --> 01:33:07.040 align:start position:0%
please I was just going to say in
 
01:33:08.149 --> 01:33:08.159 align:start position:0%
goodness knows we have enough special
 
01:33:09.669 --> 01:33:09.679 align:start position:0%
elections in the state that often times
 
01:33:12.189 --> 01:33:12.199 align:start position:0%
they could fall within each two so there
 
01:33:12.199 --> 01:33:12.950 align:start position:0%
they could fall within each two so there
were

01:33:12.950 --> 01:33:12.960 align:start position:0%
were
 
01:33:15.229 --> 01:33:15.239 align:start position:0%
just lots of ways of which this could
 
01:33:17.109 --> 01:33:17.119 align:start position:0%
run a file without someone running a
 
01:33:22.470 --> 01:33:22.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:26.830 --> 01:33:26.840 align:start position:0%
DMP all right thank you uh do any
 
01:33:32.590 --> 01:33:32.600 align:start position:0%
uh Mr uh representative c i just um
 
01:33:34.870 --> 01:33:34.880 align:start position:0%
wanted to point out that and it was
 
01:33:36.709 --> 01:33:36.719 align:start position:0%
pointed out in testimony on one of the
 
01:33:39.910 --> 01:33:39.920 align:start position:0%
bills we heard I think last week uh or
 
01:33:41.990 --> 01:33:42.000 align:start position:0%
this week
 
01:33:45.709 --> 01:33:45.719 align:start position:0%
that if you move within New Hampshire
 
01:33:49.229 --> 01:33:49.239 align:start position:0%
and notify the DMV you do not get a new
 
01:33:52.750 --> 01:33:52.760 align:start position:0%
replacement card so it has your old
 
01:33:54.790 --> 01:33:54.800 align:start position:0%
address on it
 
01:33:57.149 --> 01:33:57.159 align:start position:0%
uh until it's time to renew your
 
01:33:59.669 --> 01:33:59.679 align:start position:0%
license if the state
 
01:34:03.950 --> 01:34:03.960 align:start position:0%
police radio in the to DMV and they can
 
01:34:06.310 --> 01:34:06.320 align:start position:0%
find out your current address and know
 
01:34:07.870 --> 01:34:07.880 align:start position:0%
that it's been updated but other than
 
01:34:10.350 --> 01:34:10.360 align:start position:0%
that it's not on the
 
01:34:12.430 --> 01:34:12.440 align:start position:0%
card yeah that's correct he asked me and
 
01:34:14.470 --> 01:34:14.480 align:start position:0%
I answered honestly which was I guess my
 
01:34:16.910 --> 01:34:16.920 align:start position:0%
uh my mistake but again luckily he let
 
01:34:19.229 --> 01:34:19.239 align:start position:0%
me uh he let me uplook so I appreciated
 
01:34:22.470 --> 01:34:22.480 align:start position:0%
that I I I remember doing that and they
 
01:34:26.470 --> 01:34:26.480 align:start position:0%
the back then this was a while ago um
 
01:34:28.709 --> 01:34:28.719 align:start position:0%
the DMV just gave me a
 
01:34:31.470 --> 01:34:31.480 align:start position:0%
sticky uh thing with my new address to
 
01:34:33.990 --> 01:34:34.000 align:start position:0%
put on the back and that was supposed to
 
01:34:37.350 --> 01:34:37.360 align:start position:0%
last for a couple years
 
01:34:40.590 --> 01:34:40.600 align:start position:0%
um fortunately I didn't get pulled over
 
01:34:42.109 --> 01:34:42.119 align:start position:0%
um I didn't even get the sticky they
 
01:34:44.709 --> 01:34:44.719 align:start position:0%
just told me to use a Sharpie on the
 
01:34:48.750 --> 01:34:48.760 align:start position:0%
back yeah obviously a a prudent cost
 
01:34:51.709 --> 01:34:51.719 align:start position:0%
savings measure by New Hampshire so we
 
01:34:53.750 --> 01:34:53.760 align:start position:0%
we commend the department of motor
 
01:34:55.629 --> 01:34:55.639 align:start position:0%
vehicles for being prudent with the
 
01:34:58.990 --> 01:34:59.000 align:start position:0%
taxpayers dollars and uh doing that and
 
01:35:01.510 --> 01:35:01.520 align:start position:0%
saving the cost of stickies on the
 
01:35:04.870 --> 01:35:04.880 align:start position:0%
backup driver's license so
 
01:35:08.910 --> 01:35:08.920 align:start position:0%
um any other questions for Mr O'Brien
 
01:35:11.830 --> 01:35:11.840 align:start position:0%
thank you so much appreciate
 
01:35:14.030 --> 01:35:14.040 align:start position:0%
that all
 
01:35:20.870 --> 01:35:20.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:24.189 --> 01:35:24.199 align:start position:0%
um we've looked and examined through
 
01:35:28.149 --> 01:35:28.159 align:start position:0%
618 fairly thoroughly here this morning
 
01:35:31.149 --> 01:35:31.159 align:start position:0%
I think so uh uh rep the spon the prime
 
01:35:35.629 --> 01:35:35.639 align:start position:0%
sponsor acknowledges that so um if I
 
01:35:38.430 --> 01:35:38.440 align:start position:0%
could I'd like to move to then the next
 
01:35:44.189 --> 01:35:44.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:44.199 --> 01:35:45.830 align:start position:0%
 
unfortunately

01:35:45.830 --> 01:35:45.840 align:start position:0%
unfortunately
 
01:35:55.950 --> 01:35:55.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:59.629 --> 01:35:59.639 align:start position:0%
yes uh would you uh would you yeah would
 
01:36:00.669 --> 01:36:00.679 align:start position:0%
you mind just coming up to the
 
01:36:03.750 --> 01:36:03.760 align:start position:0%
microphone and and uh responding to that
 
01:36:06.229 --> 01:36:06.239 align:start position:0%
so um and do introduce yourself in your
 
01:36:08.669 --> 01:36:08.679 align:start position:0%
position and uh if you can restate the
 
01:36:12.149 --> 01:36:12.159 align:start position:0%
question that I asked thank you Mr chair
 
01:36:15.390 --> 01:36:15.400 align:start position:0%
uh for uh the record I am Davis Allen I
 
01:36:17.629 --> 01:36:17.639 align:start position:0%
am the committee researcher for both the
 
01:36:19.709 --> 01:36:19.719 align:start position:0%
election law committee and for this
 
01:36:23.149 --> 01:36:23.159 align:start position:0%
subcommittee of election law um so the
 
01:36:25.070 --> 01:36:25.080 align:start position:0%
question you and the subcommittee had
 
01:36:27.350 --> 01:36:27.360 align:start position:0%
asked earlier was the procedural
 
01:36:29.669 --> 01:36:29.679 align:start position:0%
questions regarding how to report back
 
01:36:33.229 --> 01:36:33.239 align:start position:0%
to the main committee um on your
 
01:36:35.390 --> 01:36:35.400 align:start position:0%
decisions determinations on the bills
 
01:36:37.629 --> 01:36:37.639 align:start position:0%
that have been referred to the
 
01:36:40.470 --> 01:36:40.480 align:start position:0%
subcommittee um my colleagues have
 
01:36:44.590 --> 01:36:44.600 align:start position:0%
provided uh answers that um we would be
 
01:36:48.070 --> 01:36:48.080 align:start position:0%
having a subcommittee vote um relative
 
01:36:50.950 --> 01:36:50.960 align:start position:0%
to any recommendations that would come
 
01:36:53.950 --> 01:36:53.960 align:start position:0%
out of the subcommittee uh it does not
 
01:36:57.030 --> 01:36:57.040 align:start position:0%
have to be a roll call it is up to uh
 
01:36:58.790 --> 01:36:58.800 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee to determine how they
 
01:37:02.590 --> 01:37:02.600 align:start position:0%
will go about it uh examples came from
 
01:37:05.990 --> 01:37:06.000 align:start position:0%
subcommittees for uh Commerce in which
 
01:37:08.669 --> 01:37:08.679 align:start position:0%
they just do uh raising their hands to
 
01:37:12.550 --> 01:37:12.560 align:start position:0%
get the count um there should be a work
 
01:37:16.750 --> 01:37:16.760 align:start position:0%
session uh sheet uh or work form um that
 
01:37:18.950 --> 01:37:18.960 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee would have uh and that
 
01:37:23.189 --> 01:37:23.199 align:start position:0%
would be utilized for that uh and then
 
01:37:25.790 --> 01:37:25.800 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee chair will usually be
 
01:37:26.950 --> 01:37:26.960 align:start position:0%
the one to communicate the
 
01:37:28.550 --> 01:37:28.560 align:start position:0%
subcommittee's recommendation to the
 
01:37:30.950 --> 01:37:30.960 align:start position:0%
full committee either during a full
 
01:37:33.590 --> 01:37:33.600 align:start position:0%
committee work session or the relevant
 
01:37:33.600 --> 01:37:39.189 align:start position:0%
committee work session or the relevant
executive

01:37:39.189 --> 01:37:39.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:42.830 --> 01:37:42.840 align:start position:0%
session thank you Mr Allen and uh we
 
01:37:46.750 --> 01:37:46.760 align:start position:0%
would also um make the standard motions
 
01:37:49.790 --> 01:37:49.800 align:start position:0%
as it were for each bill is that correct
 
01:37:52.669 --> 01:37:52.679 align:start position:0%
I I I do have work session forms in
 
01:37:54.070 --> 01:37:54.080 align:start position:0%
front of me
 
01:37:56.750 --> 01:37:56.760 align:start position:0%
and it appears that
 
01:37:59.950 --> 01:37:59.960 align:start position:0%
they uh have the the normal motions
 
01:38:02.270 --> 01:38:02.280 align:start position:0%
ought to pass ought to pass amended itl
 
01:38:05.070 --> 01:38:05.080 align:start position:0%
retained it so on
 
01:38:10.030 --> 01:38:10.040 align:start position:0%
um so those would be
 
01:38:12.310 --> 01:38:12.320 align:start position:0%
um those are the Motions that the
 
01:38:14.229 --> 01:38:14.239 align:start position:0%
subcommittee would make on a given bill
 
01:38:17.709 --> 01:38:17.719 align:start position:0%
is that the implication there that is my
 
01:38:19.550 --> 01:38:19.560 align:start position:0%
understanding it was not explicitly
 
01:38:22.109 --> 01:38:22.119 align:start position:0%
stated but I would gather from the
 
01:38:26.270 --> 01:38:26.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:29.470 --> 01:38:29.480 align:start position:0%
correct just as a followup um could you
 
01:38:33.990 --> 01:38:34.000 align:start position:0%
could you ask um if there are any other
 
01:38:35.830 --> 01:38:35.840 align:start position:0%
options that we have I think we you know
 
01:38:38.669 --> 01:38:38.679 align:start position:0%
for this particular bill I think we know
 
01:38:41.669 --> 01:38:41.679 align:start position:0%
what we probably want to do but if
 
01:38:43.870 --> 01:38:43.880 align:start position:0%
there's any other options that are
 
01:38:45.589 --> 01:38:45.599 align:start position:0%
available to the subcommittee I'd be
 
01:38:48.430 --> 01:38:48.440 align:start position:0%
curious to know what they would be so if
 
01:38:49.910 --> 01:38:49.920 align:start position:0%
if you could look into that that would
 
01:38:52.229 --> 01:38:52.239 align:start position:0%
be much appreciated yes sir all right
 
01:39:03.950 --> 01:39:03.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:12.709 --> 01:39:12.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:17.390 --> 01:39:17.400 align:start position:0%
um so the last one so 684 is the other
 
01:39:20.550 --> 01:39:20.560 align:start position:0%
Bild that I wanted to look at at least
 
01:39:22.149 --> 01:39:22.159 align:start position:0%
um for right
 
01:39:26.589 --> 01:39:26.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:31.669 --> 01:39:31.679 align:start position:0%
this is another bill that is
 
01:39:37.149 --> 01:39:37.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:37.159 --> 01:39:38.830 align:start position:0%
 
65913

01:39:38.830 --> 01:39:38.840 align:start position:0%
65913
 
01:39:41.109 --> 01:39:41.119 align:start position:0%
subsection and so I
 
01:39:47.589 --> 01:39:47.599 align:start position:0%
wanted again my my uh kind of goal here
 
01:39:49.430 --> 01:39:49.440 align:start position:0%
for at least the first part of this
 
01:39:51.790 --> 01:39:51.800 align:start position:0%
meeting or second part after the
 
01:39:54.870 --> 01:39:54.880 align:start position:0%
Soliloquy was to to try to address some
 
01:39:58.589 --> 01:39:58.599 align:start position:0%
of these bills short bills that have um
 
01:40:02.310 --> 01:40:02.320 align:start position:0%
a common RSA section in them so that we
 
01:40:03.709 --> 01:40:03.719 align:start position:0%
could you know we're sort of looking at
 
01:40:05.830 --> 01:40:05.840 align:start position:0%
the same subject at the same
 
01:40:08.310 --> 01:40:08.320 align:start position:0%
time um
 
01:40:08.320 --> 01:40:19.430 align:start position:0%
time um
so

01:40:19.430 --> 01:40:19.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:24.310 --> 01:40:24.320 align:start position:0%
uh so again let me just uh briefly
 
01:40:28.870 --> 01:40:28.880 align:start position:0%
briefly review this uh House Bill
 
01:40:33.270 --> 01:40:33.280 align:start position:0%
684 um it's an act
 
01:40:33.280 --> 01:40:34.990 align:start position:0%
684 um it's an act
that

01:40:34.990 --> 01:40:35.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:40:37.950 --> 01:40:37.960 align:start position:0%
um as written by OSS States uh
 
01:40:39.189 --> 01:40:39.199 align:start position:0%
preventing the use of student
 
01:40:40.790 --> 01:40:40.800 align:start position:0%
identification cards as a means to
 
01:40:41.750 --> 01:40:41.760 align:start position:0%
obtain a
 
01:40:41.760 --> 01:40:46.109 align:start position:0%
obtain a
ballot

01:40:46.109 --> 01:40:46.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:50.030 --> 01:40:50.040 align:start position:0%
um it does not
 
01:40:54.030 --> 01:40:54.040 align:start position:0%
um oddly enough the bill itself does not
 
01:40:56.629 --> 01:40:56.639 align:start position:0%
prohibit the use of student ID cards but
 
01:40:59.910 --> 01:40:59.920 align:start position:0%
instead requires driver's license issued
 
01:41:02.270 --> 01:41:02.280 align:start position:0%
by state or federal
 
01:41:05.070 --> 01:41:05.080 align:start position:0%
government uh identification
 
01:41:07.350 --> 01:41:07.360 align:start position:0%
cards uh under
 
01:41:10.629 --> 01:41:10.639 align:start position:0%
26021 and various subsections there or a
 
01:41:13.030 --> 01:41:13.040 align:start position:0%
non-driver's identification card issued
 
01:41:15.669 --> 01:41:15.679 align:start position:0%
by the motor vehicle
 
01:41:18.310 --> 01:41:18.320 align:start position:0%
division uh Department agency or other
 
01:41:20.070 --> 01:41:20.080 align:start position:0%
office of any other
 
01:41:24.629 --> 01:41:24.639 align:start position:0%
state um and then more uh armed services
 
01:41:26.470 --> 01:41:26.480 align:start position:0%
identification cards or United States
 
01:41:30.149 --> 01:41:30.159 align:start position:0%
passport or passcard so those are the
 
01:41:33.470 --> 01:41:33.480 align:start position:0%
types of identification that would be
 
01:41:36.870 --> 01:41:36.880 align:start position:0%
taken and um just the the main body of
 
01:41:40.589 --> 01:41:40.599 align:start position:0%
the bill I kind of uh laid down the
 
01:41:42.350 --> 01:41:42.360 align:start position:0%
examples first here but the main body of
 
01:41:43.830 --> 01:41:43.840 align:start position:0%
the bill says a valid photo
 
01:41:45.830 --> 01:41:45.840 align:start position:0%
identification shall show the name of
 
01:41:46.910 --> 01:41:46.920 align:start position:0%
the individual to whom the
 
01:41:49.709 --> 01:41:49.719 align:start position:0%
identification was issued the name shall
 
01:41:51.709 --> 01:41:51.719 align:start position:0%
substantially conform to the name on the
 
01:41:54.390 --> 01:41:54.400 align:start position:0%
individual's voter registration record
 
01:41:56.310 --> 01:41:56.320 align:start position:0%
show a photograph of the individual to
 
01:42:00.550 --> 01:42:00.560 align:start position:0%
whom the identification was issued so um
 
01:42:02.990 --> 01:42:03.000 align:start position:0%
so far so good
 
01:42:04.910 --> 01:42:04.920 align:start position:0%
um and
 
01:42:08.310 --> 01:42:08.320 align:start position:0%
then so name photograph for
 
01:42:08.320 --> 01:42:09.709 align:start position:0%
then so name photograph for
identification

01:42:09.709 --> 01:42:09.719 align:start position:0%
identification
 
01:42:12.350 --> 01:42:12.360 align:start position:0%
purposes expiration date that has not
 
01:42:13.950 --> 01:42:13.960 align:start position:0%
been exceeded by a period of more than
 
01:42:17.270 --> 01:42:17.280 align:start position:0%
60 days here it carefully notes that
 
01:42:19.950 --> 01:42:19.960 align:start position:0%
except that a voter 75 years of age or
 
01:42:21.229 --> 01:42:21.239 align:start position:0%
older may
 
01:42:24.950 --> 01:42:24.960 align:start position:0%
use uh an otherwise qualified form of
 
01:42:27.350 --> 01:42:27.360 align:start position:0%
identification that has an expiration
 
01:42:29.189 --> 01:42:29.199 align:start position:0%
date that has not been exceeded by a
 
01:42:33.310 --> 01:42:33.320 align:start position:0%
period of more than one year so
 
01:42:39.310 --> 01:42:39.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:41.910 --> 01:42:41.920 align:start position:0%
current identification
 
01:42:41.920 --> 01:42:45.589 align:start position:0%
current identification
means

01:42:45.589 --> 01:42:45.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:50.870 --> 01:42:50.880 align:start position:0%
um uh photographic means um I believe
 
01:42:53.990 --> 01:42:54.000 align:start position:0%
and then uh and then the rest States the
 
01:42:55.430 --> 01:42:55.440 align:start position:0%
following forms of identification
 
01:42:57.430 --> 01:42:57.440 align:start position:0%
bearing a photograph of the voter she'll
 
01:42:59.229 --> 01:42:59.239 align:start position:0%
satisfy the identification requirements
 
01:43:01.109 --> 01:43:01.119 align:start position:0%
and it it's that list I read earlier
 
01:43:04.470 --> 01:43:04.480 align:start position:0%
driver's license identification card arm
 
01:43:06.510 --> 01:43:06.520 align:start position:0%
Services identification card or a
 
01:43:08.270 --> 01:43:08.280 align:start position:0%
passport or
 
01:43:10.629 --> 01:43:10.639 align:start position:0%
passcard from the
 
01:43:13.950 --> 01:43:13.960 align:start position:0%
US so
 
01:43:17.189 --> 01:43:17.199 align:start position:0%
um again except for the poorly worded
 
01:43:20.950 --> 01:43:20.960 align:start position:0%
title I don't think it it
 
01:43:23.550 --> 01:43:23.560 align:start position:0%
uh it just makes a require requirement
 
01:43:26.669 --> 01:43:26.679 align:start position:0%
rather than a Prohibition so I'm not
 
01:43:31.629 --> 01:43:31.639 align:start position:0%
sure why that particular title was
 
01:43:34.990 --> 01:43:35.000 align:start position:0%
uh used but
 
01:43:38.430 --> 01:43:38.440 align:start position:0%
um I think perhaps it went to the intent
 
01:43:41.910 --> 01:43:41.920 align:start position:0%
of the bill because all the student ID
 
01:43:44.830 --> 01:43:44.840 align:start position:0%
things in the existing law are not there
 
01:43:46.709 --> 01:43:46.719 align:start position:0%
so I agree with you I don't think it's
 
01:43:49.950 --> 01:43:49.960 align:start position:0%
the best way but I think that's what
 
01:43:52.149 --> 01:43:52.159 align:start position:0%
they did when they wrote it is they
 
01:43:56.470 --> 01:43:56.480 align:start position:0%
rewrote it to it exclude all the student
 
01:44:03.310 --> 01:44:03.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:06.950 --> 01:44:06.960 align:start position:0%
if if that
 
01:44:06.960 --> 01:44:08.709 align:start position:0%
if if that
is

01:44:08.709 --> 01:44:08.719 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:44:26.790 --> 01:44:26.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:27.830 --> 01:44:27.840 align:start position:0%
it does
 
01:44:31.470 --> 01:44:31.480 align:start position:0%
remove some subsections of this of
 
01:44:34.109 --> 01:44:34.119 align:start position:0%
student identification cards which are
 
01:44:34.119 --> 01:44:39.350 align:start position:0%
student identification cards which are
not

01:44:39.350 --> 01:44:39.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:44.030 --> 01:44:44.040 align:start position:0%
um ostensibly well uh remains to be seen
 
01:44:47.430 --> 01:44:47.440 align:start position:0%
perhaps but are not
 
01:44:50.550 --> 01:44:50.560 align:start position:0%
us issued by
 
01:44:54.709 --> 01:44:54.719 align:start position:0%
a federal or state
 
01:44:58.629 --> 01:44:58.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:02.390 --> 01:45:02.400 align:start position:0%
for those sorts of specific
 
01:45:04.790 --> 01:45:04.800 align:start position:0%
identifications although the section
 
01:45:07.629 --> 01:45:07.639 align:start position:0%
above the 2A section above the numerated
 
01:45:10.629 --> 01:45:10.639 align:start position:0%
list doesn't say government issued does
 
01:45:12.950 --> 01:45:12.960 align:start position:0%
it or am I just missing
 
01:45:15.990 --> 01:45:16.000 align:start position:0%
that no those are C captured in the
 
01:45:18.750 --> 01:45:18.760 align:start position:0%
first four right those are examples of
 
01:45:22.270 --> 01:45:22.280 align:start position:0%
all examples of government issued but
 
01:45:24.550 --> 01:45:24.560 align:start position:0%
and those shall be accepted but as you
 
01:45:26.629 --> 01:45:26.639 align:start position:0%
said that it's not an
 
01:45:30.109 --> 01:45:30.119 align:start position:0%
elimination of other items that the
 
01:45:33.189 --> 01:45:33.199 align:start position:0%
paragraph above says the the
 
01:45:35.709 --> 01:45:35.719 align:start position:0%
requirements are it shows the name that
 
01:45:38.390 --> 01:45:38.400 align:start position:0%
matches the registration and it has a
 
01:45:41.030 --> 01:45:41.040 align:start position:0%
photograph and it's basically not
 
01:45:43.350 --> 01:45:43.360 align:start position:0%
expired that those are the require the
 
01:45:47.070 --> 01:45:47.080 align:start position:0%
three requirements of a valid ID to
 
01:45:49.109 --> 01:45:49.119 align:start position:0%
obtain the
 
01:45:51.629 --> 01:45:51.639 align:start position:0%
ballot and that the the numerated list
 
01:45:55.149 --> 01:45:55.159 align:start position:0%
of four just gives examples of things
 
01:45:57.109 --> 01:45:57.119 align:start position:0%
that hit those
 
01:45:57.119 --> 01:46:00.629 align:start position:0%
that hit those
three

01:46:00.629 --> 01:46:00.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:04.229 --> 01:46:04.239 align:start position:0%
requirements right um
 
01:46:07.350 --> 01:46:07.360 align:start position:0%
itn't so it doesn't yeah but we saw that
 
01:46:09.030 --> 01:46:09.040 align:start position:0%
uh the other day with a different Bill
 
01:46:12.149 --> 01:46:12.159 align:start position:0%
where the analysis statement was exactly
 
01:46:14.830 --> 01:46:14.840 align:start position:0%
the opposite of what it was trying to do
 
01:46:18.390 --> 01:46:18.400 align:start position:0%
so right and we yes and and we
 
01:46:22.229 --> 01:46:22.239 align:start position:0%
recognized that the OS had an extremely
 
01:46:24.350 --> 01:46:24.360 align:start position:0%
large number bills to process during
 
01:46:27.870 --> 01:46:27.880 align:start position:0%
that time and so that we will extend
 
01:46:30.270 --> 01:46:30.280 align:start position:0%
Grace to both sponsors co-sponsors and
 
01:46:34.669 --> 01:46:34.679 align:start position:0%
the OSS exactly for potential
 
01:46:34.679 --> 01:46:39.750 align:start position:0%
the OSS exactly for potential
inconsistencies

01:46:39.750 --> 01:46:39.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:43.070 --> 01:46:43.080 align:start position:0%
um so to me if you're
 
01:46:45.470 --> 01:46:45.480 align:start position:0%
eliminating uh five I believe was the
 
01:46:48.109 --> 01:46:48.119 align:start position:0%
one in current law is being
 
01:46:50.109 --> 01:46:50.119 align:start position:0%
eliminated that you might as well
 
01:46:53.310 --> 01:46:53.320 align:start position:0%
eliminate one through four
 
01:46:58.030 --> 01:46:58.040 align:start position:0%
because those are clearly going to hit
 
01:47:02.109 --> 01:47:02.119 align:start position:0%
name photo not expired if that's the
 
01:47:09.470 --> 01:47:09.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:13.109 --> 01:47:13.119 align:start position:0%
here uh representative Nome can you
 
01:47:14.950 --> 01:47:14.960 align:start position:0%
comment on the not what do you mean not
 
01:47:17.750 --> 01:47:17.760 align:start position:0%
ex when you said not expired well that's
 
01:47:19.669 --> 01:47:19.679 align:start position:0%
one of the requirements in the in that
 
01:47:23.430 --> 01:47:23.440 align:start position:0%
paragraph 2A is that the ID is not or
 
01:47:24.830 --> 01:47:24.840 align:start position:0%
essentially not expired I think there is
 
01:47:29.470 --> 01:47:29.480 align:start position:0%
a grace period um more than 60 days yeah
 
01:47:32.109 --> 01:47:32.119 align:start position:0%
yeah except for voter with an exception
 
01:47:34.870 --> 01:47:34.880 align:start position:0%
I note that they that the sponsor did
 
01:47:39.229 --> 01:47:39.239 align:start position:0%
raise the um uh exception for the voters
 
01:47:43.470 --> 01:47:43.480 align:start position:0%
uh 65 years of age or older up to 75 I
 
01:47:45.470 --> 01:47:45.480 align:start position:0%
on behalf of those who are in that
 
01:47:50.149 --> 01:47:50.159 align:start position:0%
decade between 65 and 75 I uh thank the
 
01:47:52.149 --> 01:47:52.159 align:start position:0%
sponsor for that sort of courtesy as
 
01:47:55.510 --> 01:47:55.520 align:start position:0%
recognizing the youthfulness of people
 
01:47:58.830 --> 01:47:58.840 align:start position:0%
between those uh parameters so I I do
 
01:48:04.350 --> 01:48:04.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:15.390 --> 01:48:15.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:15.400 --> 01:48:19.510 align:start position:0%
 
think

01:48:19.510 --> 01:48:19.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:23.830 --> 01:48:23.840 align:start position:0%
um there are uh I believe when this came
 
01:48:27.510 --> 01:48:27.520 align:start position:0%
up or maybe this was on another bill um
 
01:48:30.149 --> 01:48:30.159 align:start position:0%
that talked about government issued IDs
 
01:48:34.030 --> 01:48:34.040 align:start position:0%
I do believe that that kind of language
 
01:48:36.990 --> 01:48:37.000 align:start position:0%
is used elsewhere in the rsas I I know I
 
01:48:40.669 --> 01:48:40.679 align:start position:0%
have seen that specifically so I need to
 
01:48:43.390 --> 01:48:43.400 align:start position:0%
uh do some research on that I think
 
01:48:47.189 --> 01:48:47.199 align:start position:0%
that's that's kind of really the L
 
01:48:49.910 --> 01:48:49.920 align:start position:0%
hint I'm mixing up my words it's the
 
01:48:53.790 --> 01:48:53.800 align:start position:0%
Lynch pin um or hinge point
 
01:49:00.510 --> 01:49:00.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:06.629 --> 01:49:06.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:10.149 --> 01:49:10.159 align:start position:0%
um uh deputy secretary
 
01:49:13.350 --> 01:49:13.360 align:start position:0%
Hennessy would would you be kind enough
 
01:49:15.589 --> 01:49:15.599 align:start position:0%
to entertain a few more questions with
 
01:49:15.599 --> 01:49:16.709 align:start position:0%
to entertain a few more questions with
regard

01:49:16.709 --> 01:49:16.719 align:start position:0%
regard
 
01:49:20.990 --> 01:49:21.000 align:start position:0%
to um identifications if you know in as
 
01:49:21.000 --> 01:49:21.709 align:start position:0%
to um identifications if you know in as
much

01:49:21.709 --> 01:49:21.719 align:start position:0%
much
 
01:49:31.109 --> 01:49:31.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:35.750 --> 01:49:35.760 align:start position:0%
I thank you sure I will try yeah I we
 
01:49:38.470 --> 01:49:38.480 align:start position:0%
and the subcommittee greatly appreciates
 
01:49:42.790 --> 01:49:42.800 align:start position:0%
it um so just a a a
 
01:49:42.800 --> 01:49:44.350 align:start position:0%
it um so just a a a
question

01:49:44.350 --> 01:49:44.360 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:49:44.360 --> 01:49:48.390 align:start position:0%
question
generally

01:49:48.390 --> 01:49:48.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:51.990 --> 01:49:52.000 align:start position:0%
um on government issued IDs for you know
 
01:49:54.750 --> 01:49:54.760 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire state or other Federal
 
01:49:58.510 --> 01:49:58.520 align:start position:0%
issued IDs is there a capability for the
 
01:50:01.430 --> 01:50:01.440 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State's office to
 
01:50:05.070 --> 01:50:05.080 align:start position:0%
easily um verify the validity of those
 
01:50:07.189 --> 01:50:07.199 align:start position:0%
type of government issued
 
01:50:12.669 --> 01:50:12.679 align:start position:0%
IDs is that easily doable or I'm sort of
 
01:50:15.149 --> 01:50:15.159 align:start position:0%
in in circumstances where the
 
01:50:17.229 --> 01:50:17.239 align:start position:0%
secretaries of State's office might be
 
01:50:19.030 --> 01:50:19.040 align:start position:0%
required to
 
01:50:22.870 --> 01:50:22.880 align:start position:0%
verify identity based on government
 
01:50:26.390 --> 01:50:26.400 align:start position:0%
issued IDs is it is it easy enough for
 
01:50:29.270 --> 01:50:29.280 align:start position:0%
the Secretary of State's office to do so
 
01:50:32.470 --> 01:50:32.480 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question I will say um
 
01:50:36.149 --> 01:50:36.159 align:start position:0%
we are not required to validate an ID
 
01:50:39.109 --> 01:50:39.119 align:start position:0%
the IDS are all shown locally to local
 
01:50:42.550 --> 01:50:42.560 align:start position:0%
election officials um either to a clerk
 
01:50:45.589 --> 01:50:45.599 align:start position:0%
who intakes a voter registration and ver
 
01:50:46.790 --> 01:50:46.800 align:start position:0%
looks at the
 
01:50:49.030 --> 01:50:49.040 align:start position:0%
identification um a supervisor of
 
01:50:51.510 --> 01:50:51.520 align:start position:0%
checklist who does um voter
 
01:50:53.709 --> 01:50:53.719 align:start position:0%
registrations either at a meeting or
 
01:50:56.830 --> 01:50:56.840 align:start position:0%
same day registration or a ballot clerk
 
01:50:58.950 --> 01:50:58.960 align:start position:0%
that would look at the identification
 
01:51:04.990 --> 01:51:05.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:12.990 --> 01:51:13.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:15.830 --> 01:51:15.840 align:start position:0%
not fraudulent in any way I guess is
 
01:51:17.510 --> 01:51:17.520 align:start position:0%
that what your question
 
01:51:22.790 --> 01:51:22.800 align:start position:0%
is maybe um so uh we well certainly we
 
01:51:25.790 --> 01:51:25.800 align:start position:0%
want to prevent fraud so um so the
 
01:51:28.470 --> 01:51:28.480 align:start position:0%
ability to check that
 
01:51:30.950 --> 01:51:30.960 align:start position:0%
it you know in certain circumstances
 
01:51:32.990 --> 01:51:33.000 align:start position:0%
certainly would be beneficial but but
 
01:51:36.390 --> 01:51:36.400 align:start position:0%
perhaps that's not the
 
01:51:39.270 --> 01:51:39.280 align:start position:0%
uh the most relevant Point let me uh let
 
01:51:41.430 --> 01:51:41.440 align:start position:0%
me try another let me see if I can ask a
 
01:51:44.990 --> 01:51:45.000 align:start position:0%
better question for you in your election
 
01:51:45.000 --> 01:51:46.750 align:start position:0%
better question for you in your election
manual

01:51:46.750 --> 01:51:46.760 align:start position:0%
manual
 
01:51:50.310 --> 01:51:50.320 align:start position:0%
procedure um you identify
 
01:51:54.069 --> 01:51:54.079 align:start position:0%
different um I forms of identification
 
01:51:56.910 --> 01:51:56.920 align:start position:0%
that would be accepted and currently you
 
01:51:59.550 --> 01:51:59.560 align:start position:0%
just basically follow the statute is
 
01:52:02.270 --> 01:52:02.280 align:start position:0%
that correct yeah we follow this we do
 
01:52:06.270 --> 01:52:06.280 align:start position:0%
follow the statute um and the statute
 
01:52:08.910 --> 01:52:08.920 align:start position:0%
yay we we don't get to make stuff up
 
01:52:14.390 --> 01:52:14.400 align:start position:0%
which is great um uh yes we follow the
 
01:52:20.310 --> 01:52:20.320 align:start position:0%
statute yes all right uh thank you
 
01:52:23.910 --> 01:52:23.920 align:start position:0%
I if so if an election let me ask
 
01:52:25.629 --> 01:52:25.639 align:start position:0%
another question if an election official
 
01:52:28.430 --> 01:52:28.440 align:start position:0%
were to have a question about a
 
01:52:30.510 --> 01:52:30.520 align:start position:0%
particular form of
 
01:52:33.709 --> 01:52:33.719 align:start position:0%
identification would they would they be
 
01:52:37.189 --> 01:52:37.199 align:start position:0%
calling your office to adjudicate
 
01:52:40.510 --> 01:52:40.520 align:start position:0%
that great question um I have received a
 
01:52:43.870 --> 01:52:43.880 align:start position:0%
question one time about a tribal ID and
 
01:52:45.589 --> 01:52:45.599 align:start position:0%
my response was yes those are valid
 
01:52:50.510 --> 01:52:50.520 align:start position:0%
ideas that you can accept as um proof of
 
01:52:53.510 --> 01:52:53.520 align:start position:0%
identification so we do get questions on
 
01:52:56.870 --> 01:52:56.880 align:start position:0%
is this form of ID okay um and we will
 
01:52:58.830 --> 01:52:58.840 align:start position:0%
go to the election procedure manual are
 
01:53:03.350 --> 01:53:03.360 align:start position:0%
the law and um we basically recite back
 
01:53:07.109 --> 01:53:07.119 align:start position:0%
the law to people who have questions um
 
01:53:10.030 --> 01:53:10.040 align:start position:0%
and I believe probably the AG's office
 
01:53:11.550 --> 01:53:11.560 align:start position:0%
may get additional
 
01:53:11.560 --> 01:53:13.310 align:start position:0%
may get additional
questions

01:53:13.310 --> 01:53:13.320 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:53:15.870 --> 01:53:15.880 align:start position:0%
um and then other election officials may
 
01:53:17.589 --> 01:53:17.599 align:start position:0%
bounce questions off other election
 
01:53:19.350 --> 01:53:19.360 align:start position:0%
officials but we were not the sole
 
01:53:29.390 --> 01:53:29.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:31.910 --> 01:53:31.920 align:start position:0%
answering if I may just a quick followup
 
01:53:35.830 --> 01:53:35.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:39.109 --> 01:53:39.119 align:start position:0%
um is there a
 
01:53:41.750 --> 01:53:41.760 align:start position:0%
uh po following elections is there any
 
01:53:43.750 --> 01:53:43.760 align:start position:0%
sort of a debrief between you and the
 
01:53:46.270 --> 01:53:46.280 align:start position:0%
AG's office about these sorts of
 
01:53:49.510 --> 01:53:49.520 align:start position:0%
questions with regard to you hey did you
 
01:53:52.510 --> 01:53:52.520 align:start position:0%
get any identification questions and you
 
01:53:54.350 --> 01:53:54.360 align:start position:0%
know are there opportunities to clarify
 
01:53:56.669 --> 01:53:56.679 align:start position:0%
things in the procedure manual or the
 
01:54:00.109 --> 01:54:00.119 align:start position:0%
like yeah good question our office is in
 
01:54:01.270 --> 01:54:01.280 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to say constant
 
01:54:02.950 --> 01:54:02.960 align:start position:0%
communication but very frequent
 
01:54:05.790 --> 01:54:05.800 align:start position:0%
communication with the AG's office um
 
01:54:09.910 --> 01:54:09.920 align:start position:0%
especially around um Law changes and any
 
01:54:12.830 --> 01:54:12.840 align:start position:0%
um any information that we distribute to
 
01:54:15.709 --> 01:54:15.719 align:start position:0%
the public um for example today we
 
01:54:19.270 --> 01:54:19.280 align:start position:0%
issued a press release around HB 1569
 
01:54:20.589 --> 01:54:20.599 align:start position:0%
reminding voters if you haven't
 
01:54:21.910 --> 01:54:21.920 align:start position:0%
registered this is what you need to
 
01:54:26.189 --> 01:54:26.199 align:start position:0%
bring to register to vote um and after
 
01:54:28.229 --> 01:54:28.239 align:start position:0%
specifically after elections our office
 
01:54:31.870 --> 01:54:31.880 align:start position:0%
goes um discusses with the AG's office
 
01:54:33.629 --> 01:54:33.639 align:start position:0%
what some of their representatives may
 
01:54:35.910 --> 01:54:35.920 align:start position:0%
have found at polling locations when
 
01:54:37.950 --> 01:54:37.960 align:start position:0%
they do the AG's checklist which is a
 
01:54:39.950 --> 01:54:39.960 align:start position:0%
checklist of all the requirements that
 
01:54:41.629 --> 01:54:41.639 align:start position:0%
each polling location is supposed to
 
01:54:41.639 --> 01:54:44.709 align:start position:0%
each polling location is supposed to
have

01:54:44.709 --> 01:54:44.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:48.390 --> 01:54:48.400 align:start position:0%
um if there are frequent questions that
 
01:54:52.149 --> 01:54:52.159 align:start position:0%
come up um our our offices will discuss
 
01:54:55.550 --> 01:54:55.560 align:start position:0%
them together but I can't say that what
 
01:54:59.069 --> 01:54:59.079 align:start position:0%
type of ID is a frequent question that
 
01:54:59.079 --> 01:55:02.189 align:start position:0%
type of ID is a frequent question that
we

01:55:02.189 --> 01:55:02.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:04.669 --> 01:55:04.679 align:start position:0%
get okay thank you very much that that
 
01:55:08.910 --> 01:55:08.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:12.109 --> 01:55:12.119 align:start position:0%
um all right
 
01:55:14.790 --> 01:55:14.800 align:start position:0%
any any any other
 
01:55:18.669 --> 01:55:18.679 align:start position:0%
questions oh representative Lane you and
 
01:55:21.589 --> 01:55:21.599 align:start position:0%
thanks for being here it's very helpful
 
01:55:21.599 --> 01:55:23.790 align:start position:0%
thanks for being here it's very helpful
um

01:55:23.790 --> 01:55:23.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:55:28.910 --> 01:55:28.920 align:start position:0%
how many instances of ID fraud are I
 
01:55:33.030 --> 01:55:33.040 align:start position:0%
mean are you aware of say in the past 10
 
01:55:35.030 --> 01:55:35.040 align:start position:0%
years that would be a question for the
 
01:55:39.430 --> 01:55:39.440 align:start position:0%
AG's office okay yep is anybody
 
01:55:43.229 --> 01:55:43.239 align:start position:0%
coming from the AG's office not today we
 
01:55:45.510 --> 01:55:45.520 align:start position:0%
can certainly no no I mean later we can
 
01:55:48.550 --> 01:55:48.560 align:start position:0%
invite them yes yeah and yeah I because
 
01:55:50.870 --> 01:55:50.880 align:start position:0%
I'm just I just want to make sure we're
 
01:55:52.790 --> 01:55:52.800 align:start position:0%
solving a problem that's really out
 
01:55:55.390 --> 01:55:55.400 align:start position:0%
there um so I that was my question for
 
01:55:58.550 --> 01:55:58.560 align:start position:0%
both when I was fumbling before for on
 
01:56:00.830 --> 01:56:00.840 align:start position:0%
uh the other bill that that was the same
 
01:56:07.470 --> 01:56:07.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:10.870 --> 01:56:10.880 align:start position:0%
you any F not seeing any further
 
01:56:12.990 --> 01:56:13.000 align:start position:0%
questions um I want to thank you again
 
01:56:15.589 --> 01:56:15.599 align:start position:0%
for providing that testimony I would
 
01:56:19.870 --> 01:56:19.880 align:start position:0%
suggest um if we could take maybe a
 
01:56:24.229 --> 01:56:24.239 align:start position:0%
quick 15minute break and and
 
01:56:27.350 --> 01:56:27.360 align:start position:0%
um that would allow representative Lane
 
01:56:29.910 --> 01:56:29.920 align:start position:0%
and I to have a brief discussion and
 
01:56:33.189 --> 01:56:33.199 align:start position:0%
then maybe a separate caucus or and then
 
01:56:36.750 --> 01:56:36.760 align:start position:0%
reconvene at in approximately 15 minutes
 
01:56:37.950 --> 01:56:37.960 align:start position:0%
would that be
 
01:56:42.990 --> 01:56:43.000 align:start position:0%
okay all right so we will uh recess or
 
01:56:45.870 --> 01:56:45.880 align:start position:0%
break for 15 minutes and resume at
 
01:56:50.870 --> 01:56:50.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:53.870 --> 01:56:53.880 align:start position:0%
12 Mr determined before we do that did
 
01:56:56.790 --> 01:56:56.800 align:start position:0%

02:13:37.270 --> 02:13:37.280 align:start position:0%
all right so we'll uh reconvene the
 
02:13:42.390 --> 02:13:42.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:42.400 --> 02:13:44.350 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:13:44.350 --> 02:13:44.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:13:47.229 --> 02:13:47.239 align:start position:0%
and let's see at this point we're going
 
02:13:51.589 --> 02:13:51.599 align:start position:0%
to take a look at taking action on one
 
02:13:54.510 --> 02:13:54.520 align:start position:0%
bill representative Lane do you have a
 
02:13:57.430 --> 02:13:57.440 align:start position:0%
motion you would like to make sure I
 
02:14:00.189 --> 02:14:00.199 align:start position:0%
would like to move that we recommend or
 
02:14:05.390 --> 02:14:05.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:08.109 --> 02:14:08.119 align:start position:0%
hp472 Representative blae makes a motion
 
02:14:12.669 --> 02:14:12.679 align:start position:0%
that we itl HB 472 requiring voters to
 
02:14:15.629 --> 02:14:15.639 align:start position:0%
prove domicile is there a second I'll
 
02:14:18.430 --> 02:14:18.440 align:start position:0%
make a second thank you thank
 
02:14:21.709 --> 02:14:21.719 align:start position:0%
you representative C makes a second
 
02:14:25.470 --> 02:14:25.480 align:start position:0%
here so just one moment while I capture
 
02:14:37.189 --> 02:14:37.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:37.199 --> 02:14:40.950 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:14:40.950 --> 02:14:40.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:47.030 --> 02:14:47.040 align:start position:0%
February okay um so uh all right so the
 
02:14:48.990 --> 02:14:49.000 align:start position:0%
motion is itl it's been moved and
 
02:14:51.030 --> 02:14:51.040 align:start position:0%
seconded uh let's have discuss
 
02:14:52.430 --> 02:14:52.440 align:start position:0%
discussion on this is there any
 
02:14:55.229 --> 02:14:55.239 align:start position:0%
discussion representative Lane um sure
 
02:14:57.069 --> 02:14:57.079 align:start position:0%
I'll just speak to the motion I uh
 
02:15:00.950 --> 02:15:00.960 align:start position:0%
during testimony we heard that this bill
 
02:15:06.910 --> 02:15:06.920 align:start position:0%
uh conflated uh dool and um and uh
 
02:15:10.830 --> 02:15:10.840 align:start position:0%
identification and that uh we re really
 
02:15:13.189 --> 02:15:13.199 align:start position:0%
felt that given that we needed to
 
02:15:15.470 --> 02:15:15.480 align:start position:0%
distinguish it between registration and
 
02:15:19.229 --> 02:15:19.239 align:start position:0%
voting and um for that reason we felt
 
02:15:22.109 --> 02:15:22.119 align:start position:0%
the bill as written didn't was confusing
 
02:15:24.589 --> 02:15:24.599 align:start position:0%
and we would just prefer to itl it and
 
02:15:26.430 --> 02:15:26.440 align:start position:0%
we'll move on to some of the other bills
 
02:15:28.830 --> 02:15:28.840 align:start position:0%
that we have before us I don't know if
 
02:15:32.030 --> 02:15:32.040 align:start position:0%
that's enough
 
02:15:34.149 --> 02:15:34.159 align:start position:0%
but any further comments from the
 
02:15:37.350 --> 02:15:37.360 align:start position:0%
subcommittee sure thank you uh yeah I
 
02:15:41.069 --> 02:15:41.079 align:start position:0%
agree I just uh want I believe that the
 
02:15:43.510 --> 02:15:43.520 align:start position:0%
although it's a it's a good bill I it's
 
02:15:46.069 --> 02:15:46.079 align:start position:0%
just in the wrong location pertaining to
 
02:15:49.189 --> 02:15:49.199 align:start position:0%
the RSA that's addressed in the bill so
 
02:15:51.310 --> 02:15:51.320 align:start position:0%
for that reason
 
02:15:54.310 --> 02:15:54.320 align:start position:0%
it it it does have a
 
02:15:56.589 --> 02:15:56.599 align:start position:0%
conflict thank you all right thank you
 
02:16:00.030 --> 02:16:00.040 align:start position:0%
representative bernham uh again I I
 
02:16:02.069 --> 02:16:02.079 align:start position:0%
would also Echo what has already been
 
02:16:04.790 --> 02:16:04.800 align:start position:0%
said by both Representatives Lan and
 
02:16:07.189 --> 02:16:07.199 align:start position:0%
Burnham is that it really is a
 
02:16:10.709 --> 02:16:10.719 align:start position:0%
conflation of these two uh processes the
 
02:16:15.629 --> 02:16:15.639 align:start position:0%
registration versus check-in and
 
02:16:19.950 --> 02:16:19.960 align:start position:0%
um while you do have to provide proof of
 
02:16:22.830 --> 02:16:22.840 align:start position:0%
domicile when registering you do you
 
02:16:25.750 --> 02:16:25.760 align:start position:0%
should not have to prove that at checkin
 
02:16:28.310 --> 02:16:28.320 align:start position:0%
and so we need to make sure that we keep
 
02:16:32.309 --> 02:16:32.319 align:start position:0%
the swim Lanes clear and that um those
 
02:16:35.190 --> 02:16:35.200 align:start position:0%
two processes are not conflated in any
 
02:16:38.429 --> 02:16:38.439 align:start position:0%
way and for that reason that seems to be
 
02:16:38.439 --> 02:16:40.030 align:start position:0%
way and for that reason that seems to be
um

02:16:40.030 --> 02:16:40.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:16:40.040 --> 02:16:41.549 align:start position:0%
um
a

02:16:41.549 --> 02:16:41.559 align:start position:0%
a
 
02:16:45.070 --> 02:16:45.080 align:start position:0%
uh an appropriate uh analysis of the
 
02:16:47.870 --> 02:16:47.880 align:start position:0%
situation so at this point um we're
 
02:16:50.990 --> 02:16:51.000 align:start position:0%
allowed I believe as Mr Allen explained
 
02:16:55.589 --> 02:16:55.599 align:start position:0%
we are allowed to take simply a um a
 
02:16:57.629 --> 02:16:57.639 align:start position:0%
vote uh simple vote we don't have to do
 
02:16:59.349 --> 02:16:59.359 align:start position:0%
a roll call
 
02:17:03.270 --> 02:17:03.280 align:start position:0%
um and so we'll just take uh all those
 
02:17:08.589 --> 02:17:08.599 align:start position:0%
in favor of moving House Bill 472 as itl
 
02:17:11.070 --> 02:17:11.080 align:start position:0%
to send back to the election law
 
02:17:14.990 --> 02:17:15.000 align:start position:0%
committee for further processing um
 
02:17:16.750 --> 02:17:16.760 align:start position:0%
raise your
 
02:17:22.190 --> 02:17:22.200 align:start position:0%
hands all right five to zero so um
 
02:17:26.070 --> 02:17:26.080 align:start position:0%
okay so at this point um the
 
02:17:29.589 --> 02:17:29.599 align:start position:0%
committee has
 
02:17:31.910 --> 02:17:31.920 align:start position:0%
uh I'm not sure of the exact right
 
02:17:34.030 --> 02:17:34.040 align:start position:0%
wording but we'll say has moved this
 
02:17:37.429 --> 02:17:37.439 align:start position:0%
bill back to the election law committee
 
02:17:41.589 --> 02:17:41.599 align:start position:0%
on um the basics that while it has
 
02:17:44.910 --> 02:17:44.920 align:start position:0%
merits it does conflate the registration
 
02:17:46.790 --> 02:17:46.800 align:start position:0%
and check-in process and then therefore
 
02:17:49.549 --> 02:17:49.559 align:start position:0%
is in appropriate is inappropriate at
 
02:17:51.910 --> 02:17:51.920 align:start position:0%
this time for further
 
02:17:54.950 --> 02:17:54.960 align:start position:0%
consideration all right so thank you for
 
02:17:59.509 --> 02:17:59.519 align:start position:0%
uh that um we've uh congratulations
 
02:18:01.629 --> 02:18:01.639 align:start position:0%
subcommittee we've accomplished at least
 
02:18:05.549 --> 02:18:05.559 align:start position:0%
one one thing today um yeah we made our
 
02:18:07.309 --> 02:18:07.319 align:start position:0%
load lighter and that's that's always a
 
02:18:12.830 --> 02:18:12.840 align:start position:0%
good thing so um let me just look at we
 
02:18:16.990 --> 02:18:17.000 align:start position:0%
we have approximately another 45 minutes
 
02:18:21.110 --> 02:18:21.120 align:start position:0%
and I'm wondering if we can tackle
 
02:18:26.790 --> 02:18:26.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:30.309 --> 02:18:30.319 align:start position:0%
um were there other categories like what
 
02:18:34.950 --> 02:18:34.960 align:start position:0%
you did here that refer to one or yeah
 
02:18:37.869 --> 02:18:37.879 align:start position:0%
I'm thinking that it might be possible
 
02:18:37.879 --> 02:18:40.389 align:start position:0%
I'm thinking that it might be possible
[Music]

02:18:40.389 --> 02:18:40.399 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:18:40.399 --> 02:18:42.990 align:start position:0%
[Music]
to

02:18:42.990 --> 02:18:43.000 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:18:46.340 --> 02:18:46.350 align:start position:0%
um ah no I I misread it
 
02:18:46.350 --> 02:18:47.750 align:start position:0%
um ah no I I misread it
[Music]

02:18:47.750 --> 02:18:47.760 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:18:57.709 --> 02:18:57.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:57.719 --> 02:18:58.629 align:start position:0%
 
I

02:18:58.629 --> 02:18:58.639 align:start position:0%
I
 
02:19:02.509 --> 02:19:02.519 align:start position:0%
don't so at at this at this point so my
 
02:19:05.429 --> 02:19:05.439 align:start position:0%
dilemma is that um we start to get into
 
02:19:08.309 --> 02:19:08.319 align:start position:0%
the longer bills if we try to
 
02:19:12.230 --> 02:19:12.240 align:start position:0%
combine um those that uh intersect
 
02:19:14.509 --> 02:19:14.519 align:start position:0%
similar rsas and again I'm going to
 
02:19:19.110 --> 02:19:19.120 align:start position:0%
reserve um 385 since that is 19 Pages
 
02:19:20.950 --> 02:19:20.960 align:start position:0%
I'll reserve a full session for that
 
02:19:24.549 --> 02:19:24.559 align:start position:0%
that um at some other
 
02:19:24.559 --> 02:19:29.709 align:start position:0%
that um at some other
time

02:19:29.709 --> 02:19:29.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:33.629 --> 02:19:33.639 align:start position:0%
um 365 is
 
02:19:41.549 --> 02:19:41.559 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:41.559 --> 02:19:43.790 align:start position:0%
 
citizenship

02:19:43.790 --> 02:19:43.800 align:start position:0%
citizenship
 
02:19:49.190 --> 02:19:49.200 align:start position:0%
yes 385 is is is the n 19 pager I'm not
 
02:19:52.510 --> 02:19:52.520 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to do that today
 
02:19:59.469 --> 02:19:59.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:02.750 --> 02:20:02.760 align:start position:0%
think let's ju just bear with me for
 
02:20:10.510 --> 02:20:10.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:12.830 --> 02:20:12.840 align:start position:0%
um we could
 
02:20:12.840 --> 02:20:14.389 align:start position:0%
um we could
do

02:20:14.389 --> 02:20:14.399 align:start position:0%
do
 
02:20:19.110 --> 02:20:19.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:22.270 --> 02:20:22.280 align:start position:0%
other why don't we we look at at least
 
02:20:22.280 --> 02:20:23.950 align:start position:0%
other why don't we we look at at least
discuss

02:20:23.950 --> 02:20:23.960 align:start position:0%
discuss
 
02:20:23.960 --> 02:20:28.710 align:start position:0%
discuss
for

02:20:28.710 --> 02:20:28.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:33.830 --> 02:20:33.840 align:start position:0%
um House Bill 686 it's it is three
 
02:20:36.830 --> 02:20:36.840 align:start position:0%
pages it's requiring a voter to provide
 
02:20:38.790 --> 02:20:38.800 align:start position:0%
identification when requesting an
 
02:20:43.190 --> 02:20:43.200 align:start position:0%
absentee ballot um why don't we take
 
02:20:46.309 --> 02:20:46.319 align:start position:0%
that as
 
02:20:51.469 --> 02:20:51.479 align:start position:0%
our um next task for today we will will
 
02:20:54.389 --> 02:20:54.399 align:start position:0%
basically try to discuss
 
02:20:54.399 --> 02:20:57.070 align:start position:0%
basically try to discuss
this

02:20:57.070 --> 02:20:57.080 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:21:01.870 --> 02:21:01.880 align:start position:0%
and um see see what sort of um
 
02:21:03.830 --> 02:21:03.840 align:start position:0%
information we can do on this so let me
 
02:21:06.790 --> 02:21:06.800 align:start position:0%
just kind of review this very quickly
 
02:21:06.800 --> 02:21:07.950 align:start position:0%
just kind of review this very quickly
the

02:21:07.950 --> 02:21:07.960 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:21:10.710 --> 02:21:10.720 align:start position:0%
analysis um States it requires anyone
 
02:21:12.630 --> 02:21:12.640 align:start position:0%
who requests an absentee ballot to
 
02:21:14.590 --> 02:21:14.600 align:start position:0%
provide a copy of a government issued
 
02:21:17.030 --> 02:21:17.040 align:start position:0%
photo identification along with their
 
02:21:19.870 --> 02:21:19.880 align:start position:0%
absentee ballot application it requires
 
02:21:22.150 --> 02:21:22.160 align:start position:0%
that the application be notorized and it
 
02:21:24.309 --> 02:21:24.319 align:start position:0%
requires a person to cure any errors in
 
02:21:27.270 --> 02:21:27.280 align:start position:0%
the application in person and to prove
 
02:21:30.750 --> 02:21:30.760 align:start position:0%
their domicile to a city or town clerk
 
02:21:30.760 --> 02:21:31.550 align:start position:0%
their domicile to a city or town clerk
and

02:21:31.550 --> 02:21:31.560 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:21:31.560 --> 02:21:34.870 align:start position:0%
and
then

02:21:34.870 --> 02:21:34.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:36.910 --> 02:21:36.920 align:start position:0%
um just
 
02:21:43.309 --> 02:21:43.319 align:start position:0%
summarizing uh section one has is a long
 
02:21:48.110 --> 02:21:48.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:52.110 --> 02:21:52.120 align:start position:0%
approximately two pages
 
02:21:53.870 --> 02:21:53.880 align:start position:0%
where it goes through a list of
 
02:21:53.880 --> 02:21:55.030 align:start position:0%
where it goes through a list of
different

02:21:55.030 --> 02:21:55.040 align:start position:0%
different
 
02:21:56.870 --> 02:21:56.880 align:start position:0%
qualifications that would make the
 
02:22:00.469 --> 02:22:00.479 align:start position:0%
person eligible for an absentee ballot
 
02:22:00.479 --> 02:22:01.550 align:start position:0%
person eligible for an absentee ballot

02:22:04.110 --> 02:22:04.120 align:start position:0%
includes uh absence due to Residence
 
02:22:05.990 --> 02:22:06.000 align:start position:0%

02:22:20.750 --> 02:22:20.760 align:start position:0%
and so I I'll just um there's there's
 
02:22:23.750 --> 02:22:23.760 align:start position:0%
quite a list here so just for the
 
02:22:25.630 --> 02:22:25.640 align:start position:0%

02:25:49.389 --> 02:25:49.399 align:start position:0%
disability and then uh page three then
 
02:25:51.910 --> 02:25:51.920 align:start position:0%
gets into
 
02:25:57.269 --> 02:25:57.279 align:start position:0%
um really the the notary aspects of this
 
02:26:01.870 --> 02:26:01.880 align:start position:0%
uh process so and this is um and this is
 
02:26:01.880 --> 02:26:02.830 align:start position:0%
uh process so and this is um and this is
the

02:26:02.830 --> 02:26:02.840 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:26:05.910 --> 02:26:05.920 align:start position:0%
additional aspects that are that are
 
02:26:08.830 --> 02:26:08.840 align:start position:0%
being provided here that most of what I
 
02:26:13.070 --> 02:26:13.080 align:start position:0%
read before is not new it is current um
 
02:26:16.190 --> 02:26:16.200 align:start position:0%
but what is new is the applicant must
 
02:26:19.429 --> 02:26:19.439 align:start position:0%
sign and notorized this form to receive
 
02:26:21.429 --> 02:26:21.439 align:start position:0%
a absentee
 
02:26:21.439 --> 02:26:23.550 align:start position:0%
a absentee
ballot

02:26:23.550 --> 02:26:23.560 align:start position:0%
ballot
 
02:26:26.349 --> 02:26:26.359 align:start position:0%
um and the person who witnesses and
 
02:26:27.950 --> 02:26:27.960 align:start position:0%
signs assists a voter with the
 
02:26:30.630 --> 02:26:30.640 align:start position:0%
disability executing the form shall sign
 
02:26:32.910 --> 02:26:32.920 align:start position:0%
and notorized
 
02:26:36.349 --> 02:26:36.359 align:start position:0%
um the moderator will
 
02:26:39.349 --> 02:26:39.359 align:start position:0%
compare the voter's signature
 
02:26:41.790 --> 02:26:41.800 align:start position:0%
application with the notorized signature
 
02:26:44.630 --> 02:26:44.640 align:start position:0%
on the notorized statement and if the
 
02:26:48.590 --> 02:26:48.600 align:start position:0%
applicant does not have the form uh
 
02:26:52.110 --> 02:26:52.120 align:start position:0%
notorized um the bill proposes that the
 
02:26:54.590 --> 02:26:54.600 align:start position:0%
applicant's ballot application will be
 
02:26:58.389 --> 02:26:58.399 align:start position:0%
rejected um subject to curing the
 
02:27:00.950 --> 02:27:00.960 align:start position:0%
defective application under
 
02:27:06.349 --> 02:27:06.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:06.359 --> 02:27:08.590 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:27:08.590 --> 02:27:08.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:27:12.510 --> 02:27:12.520 align:start position:0%
and there's also a uh requirement to
 
02:27:14.269 --> 02:27:14.279 align:start position:0%
provide a color copy of a valid
 
02:27:16.750 --> 02:27:16.760 align:start position:0%
government issued photo identification
 
02:27:19.230 --> 02:27:19.240 align:start position:0%
to receive an absentee ballot I believe
 
02:27:22.590 --> 02:27:22.600 align:start position:0%
that the sponsor explained that um this
 
02:27:24.910 --> 02:27:24.920 align:start position:0%
is less easy
 
02:27:24.920 --> 02:27:27.150 align:start position:0%
is less easy
to

02:27:27.150 --> 02:27:27.160 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:27:27.160 --> 02:27:28.990 align:start position:0%
to
um

02:27:28.990 --> 02:27:29.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:27:31.389 --> 02:27:31.399 align:start position:0%
Forge and
 
02:27:34.510 --> 02:27:34.520 align:start position:0%
if and states that if if a color copy of
 
02:27:36.710 --> 02:27:36.720 align:start position:0%
the photo identification is not
 
02:27:36.720 --> 02:27:38.269 align:start position:0%
the photo identification is not
provided

02:27:38.269 --> 02:27:38.279 align:start position:0%
provided
 
02:27:41.590 --> 02:27:41.600 align:start position:0%
um then it will be rejected other than
 
02:27:45.469 --> 02:27:45.479 align:start position:0%
the ability to to cure the defective
 
02:27:48.110 --> 02:27:48.120 align:start position:0%
application under
 
02:27:51.790 --> 02:27:51.800 align:start position:0%
6576 um and then fin finally um it goes
 
02:27:55.870 --> 02:27:55.880 align:start position:0%
on under
 
02:27:59.630 --> 02:27:59.640 align:start position:0%
6576 and adds a new
 
02:28:01.750 --> 02:28:01.760 align:start position:0%
section um any applicant whose
 
02:28:03.429 --> 02:28:03.439 align:start position:0%
application form does not comport with
 
02:28:07.070 --> 02:28:07.080 align:start position:0%
the requirements above under
 
02:28:10.150 --> 02:28:10.160 align:start position:0%
6574 um may appear before the city or
 
02:28:11.910 --> 02:28:11.920 align:start position:0%
town clerk subject to their ability to
 
02:28:14.030 --> 02:28:14.040 align:start position:0%
verify their domicile with the clerk and
 
02:28:15.790 --> 02:28:15.800 align:start position:0%
amend their application form to cure any
 
02:28:20.190 --> 02:28:20.200 align:start position:0%
and all defects so again just require
 
02:28:22.630 --> 02:28:22.640 align:start position:0%
iring that if they're going to cure it
 
02:28:25.630 --> 02:28:25.640 align:start position:0%
they do so with the clerk uh city or
 
02:28:29.389 --> 02:28:29.399 align:start position:0%
town clerk so that it
 
02:28:33.429 --> 02:28:33.439 align:start position:0%
is um really seen by someone who serves
 
02:28:35.469 --> 02:28:35.479 align:start position:0%
as an election official and it's it's
 
02:28:37.590 --> 02:28:37.600 align:start position:0%
being uh
 
02:28:40.269 --> 02:28:40.279 align:start position:0%
appropriately uh remedied under those
 
02:28:40.279 --> 02:28:43.110 align:start position:0%
appropriately uh remedied under those
circumstances

02:28:43.110 --> 02:28:43.120 align:start position:0%
circumstances
 
02:28:50.190 --> 02:28:50.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:58.309 --> 02:28:58.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:02.990 --> 02:29:03.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:03.000 --> 02:29:05.389 align:start position:0%
 
notorized

02:29:05.389 --> 02:29:05.399 align:start position:0%
notorized
 
02:29:05.399 --> 02:29:14.110 align:start position:0%
notorized
up

02:29:14.110 --> 02:29:14.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:17.070 --> 02:29:17.080 align:start position:0%
um all right having kind of covered that
 
02:29:18.950 --> 02:29:18.960 align:start position:0%
bill are there any comments from the
 
02:29:21.550 --> 02:29:21.560 align:start position:0%
subcommittee representative
 
02:29:23.710 --> 02:29:23.720 align:start position:0%
C uh yes
 
02:29:28.550 --> 02:29:28.560 align:start position:0%
this um ends up being a situation
 
02:29:32.510 --> 02:29:32.520 align:start position:0%
where uh if other legislation passes
 
02:29:35.110 --> 02:29:35.120 align:start position:0%
they could be required to get two
 
02:29:37.990 --> 02:29:38.000 align:start position:0%
notaries one on the application and one
 
02:29:39.590 --> 02:29:39.600 align:start position:0%
for the absentee
 
02:29:44.349 --> 02:29:44.359 align:start position:0%
ballot uh the uh form on the outer or
 
02:29:47.070 --> 02:29:47.080 align:start position:0%
the inner envelope
 
02:29:51.190 --> 02:29:51.200 align:start position:0%
and just under that I'm I would think
 
02:29:51.200 --> 02:29:53.230 align:start position:0%
and just under that I'm I would think
that

02:29:53.230 --> 02:29:53.240 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:29:57.670 --> 02:29:57.680 align:start position:0%
uh on this I would be more interested in
 
02:30:00.790 --> 02:30:00.800 align:start position:0%
having the notarization on
 
02:30:00.800 --> 02:30:02.469 align:start position:0%
having the notarization on
the

02:30:02.469 --> 02:30:02.479 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:30:06.469 --> 02:30:06.479 align:start position:0%
um inner envelope of the ballot
 
02:30:09.590 --> 02:30:09.600 align:start position:0%
itself as being the person who filled
 
02:30:12.389 --> 02:30:12.399 align:start position:0%
out the ballot rather than the
 
02:30:14.630 --> 02:30:14.640 align:start position:0%
application but I don't think it needs
 
02:30:16.670 --> 02:30:16.680 align:start position:0%
the notary needs to be done
 
02:30:20.990 --> 02:30:21.000 align:start position:0%
twice um and also I just noted on page
 
02:30:24.670 --> 02:30:24.680 align:start position:0%
three line five where it says applicant
 
02:30:27.790 --> 02:30:27.800 align:start position:0%
must sign and notorized I think that
 
02:30:32.110 --> 02:30:32.120 align:start position:0%
would probably properly be uh need to
 
02:30:35.349 --> 02:30:35.359 align:start position:0%
say and have notorized
 
02:30:37.950 --> 02:30:37.960 align:start position:0%
because presumably the applicant is not
 
02:30:37.960 --> 02:30:38.870 align:start position:0%
because presumably the applicant is not
a

02:30:38.870 --> 02:30:38.880 align:start position:0%
a
 
02:30:42.389 --> 02:30:42.399 align:start position:0%
notary and I I would also guess that a
 
02:30:44.269 --> 02:30:44.279 align:start position:0%
notary would not be able to notorized
 
02:30:46.830 --> 02:30:46.840 align:start position:0%
their own
 
02:30:49.070 --> 02:30:49.080 align:start position:0%
documents could you point that out where
 
02:30:50.630 --> 02:30:50.640 align:start position:0%
that is again
 
02:30:55.070 --> 02:30:55.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:57.469 --> 02:30:57.479 align:start position:0%
five and it just says the applicant must
 
02:31:00.630 --> 02:31:00.640 align:start position:0%
sign and notorized but the applicant
 
02:31:03.590 --> 02:31:03.600 align:start position:0%
doesn't notorized it the he has it
 
02:31:03.600 --> 02:31:05.070 align:start position:0%
doesn't notorized it the he has it
notorized

02:31:05.070 --> 02:31:05.080 align:start position:0%
notorized
 
02:31:07.190 --> 02:31:07.200 align:start position:0%
by somebody
 
02:31:09.910 --> 02:31:09.920 align:start position:0%
else and
 
02:31:11.750 --> 02:31:11.760 align:start position:0%
also if
 
02:31:11.760 --> 02:31:13.870 align:start position:0%
also if
the

02:31:13.870 --> 02:31:13.880 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:31:18.309 --> 02:31:18.319 align:start position:0%
applicant um goes into the town
 
02:31:20.510 --> 02:31:20.520 align:start position:0%
clerk the town clerk clerk should be
 
02:31:23.630 --> 02:31:23.640 align:start position:0%
able to issue that and we had a bill
 
02:31:24.950 --> 02:31:24.960 align:start position:0%
that would
 
02:31:28.710 --> 02:31:28.720 align:start position:0%
allow the uh Town Clerk and Deputy clerk
 
02:31:30.030 --> 02:31:30.040 align:start position:0%
to be able
 
02:31:30.040 --> 02:31:31.750 align:start position:0%
to be able
to

02:31:31.750 --> 02:31:31.760 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:31:34.469 --> 02:31:34.479 align:start position:0%
um essentially notorized the document
 
02:31:39.190 --> 02:31:39.200 align:start position:0%
even if they are not an actual notary
 
02:31:42.750 --> 02:31:42.760 align:start position:0%
public so my concern is that this is
 
02:31:42.760 --> 02:31:43.260 align:start position:0%
public so my concern is that this is
asking

02:31:43.260 --> 02:31:43.270 align:start position:0%
asking
 
02:31:43.270 --> 02:31:44.790 align:start position:0%
asking
[Music]

02:31:44.790 --> 02:31:44.800 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:31:48.190 --> 02:31:48.200 align:start position:0%
for uh we would end up we could end up
 
02:31:50.750 --> 02:31:50.760 align:start position:0%
asking for an absentee voter to have to
 
02:31:52.389 --> 02:31:52.399 align:start position:0%
pay for two
 
02:31:57.550 --> 02:31:57.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:02.309 --> 02:32:02.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:04.590 --> 02:32:04.600 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
02:32:08.790 --> 02:32:08.800 align:start position:0%
Lane I I would a agree well I I think
 
02:32:13.429 --> 02:32:13.439 align:start position:0%
asking the notary on on either place is
 
02:32:15.750 --> 02:32:15.760 align:start position:0%
in inappropriate and I guess not
 
02:32:17.190 --> 02:32:17.200 align:start position:0%
inappropriate but
 
02:32:21.190 --> 02:32:21.200 align:start position:0%
unnecessary um but focusing on this bill
 
02:32:24.030 --> 02:32:24.040 align:start position:0%
um not everybody has I mean I don't have
 
02:32:26.630 --> 02:32:26.640 align:start position:0%
a color copier I I just don't understand
 
02:32:28.190 --> 02:32:28.200 align:start position:0%
why it needs to be a color copy and I
 
02:32:32.150 --> 02:32:32.160 align:start position:0%
don't understand um why it needs to be a
 
02:32:35.870 --> 02:32:35.880 align:start position:0%
copy um I mean we've wor we've lived
 
02:32:39.750 --> 02:32:39.760 align:start position:0%
without it all this time and uh even and
 
02:32:41.630 --> 02:32:41.640 align:start position:0%
the clerk's Association was against this
 
02:32:44.630 --> 02:32:44.640 align:start position:0%
too so I guess I'm I'm just not quite
 
02:32:48.349 --> 02:32:48.359 align:start position:0%
sure about you know one a color copier
 
02:32:49.670 --> 02:32:49.680 align:start position:0%
but you're also going to be requiring
 
02:32:51.870 --> 02:32:51.880 align:start position:0%
people people who want to vote Fon T to
 
02:32:55.110 --> 02:32:55.120 align:start position:0%
either have a copier or get to a place
 
02:32:57.950 --> 02:32:57.960 align:start position:0%
with a copier and particularly if
 
02:33:00.510 --> 02:33:00.520 align:start position:0%
they're infirm or you know not able to
 
02:33:02.150 --> 02:33:02.160 align:start position:0%
get out of the house they're not going
 
02:33:04.429 --> 02:33:04.439 align:start position:0%
to be able to get to a copier I I just
 
02:33:06.150 --> 02:33:06.160 align:start position:0%
don't understand the requirement I think
 
02:33:21.230 --> 02:33:21.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:21.240 --> 02:33:23.630 align:start position:0%
 
I

02:33:23.630 --> 02:33:23.640 align:start position:0%
I
 
02:33:26.990 --> 02:33:27.000 align:start position:0%
um your your point is noted I think
 
02:33:29.750 --> 02:33:29.760 align:start position:0%
again I we we want to have everyone at
 
02:33:32.349 --> 02:33:32.359 align:start position:0%
an on an equal playing field and I
 
02:33:37.349 --> 02:33:37.359 align:start position:0%
don't I don't know that we want to
 
02:33:37.359 --> 02:33:44.309 align:start position:0%
don't I don't know that we want to
have

02:33:44.309 --> 02:33:44.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:48.190 --> 02:33:48.200 align:start position:0%
um for for absentee
 
02:33:52.830 --> 02:33:52.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:52.840 --> 02:33:55.469 align:start position:0%
 
Act

02:33:55.469 --> 02:33:55.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:59.590 --> 02:33:59.600 align:start position:0%
of registration and check in the the two
 
02:34:01.590 --> 02:34:01.600 align:start position:0%
processes that we've T been talking
 
02:34:03.469 --> 02:34:03.479 align:start position:0%
about are
 
02:34:10.950 --> 02:34:10.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:16.910 --> 02:34:16.920 align:start position:0%
be distinct and different um but not not
 
02:34:20.750 --> 02:34:20.760 align:start position:0%
so so different as but not
 
02:34:23.630 --> 02:34:23.640 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I'm want to make sure I say
 
02:34:26.110 --> 02:34:26.120 align:start position:0%
these words correctly is there should
 
02:34:27.870 --> 02:34:27.880 align:start position:0%
also be for absentee
 
02:34:30.950 --> 02:34:30.960 align:start position:0%
ballots um a registration and a check-in
 
02:34:34.469 --> 02:34:34.479 align:start position:0%
process it by Nature has to be different
 
02:34:36.990 --> 02:34:37.000 align:start position:0%
because of the nature of absente ballots
 
02:34:39.710 --> 02:34:39.720 align:start position:0%
but um the same questions that are
 
02:34:43.790 --> 02:34:43.800 align:start position:0%
answered for the pre-registered election
 
02:34:46.870 --> 02:34:46.880 align:start position:0%
day voter that I discussed earlier still
 
02:34:48.910 --> 02:34:48.920 align:start position:0%
need to be answered for those applying
 
02:34:50.389 --> 02:34:50.399 align:start position:0%
for an absentee
 
02:34:54.550 --> 02:34:54.560 align:start position:0%
ballot and so I think I think we should
 
02:34:58.309 --> 02:34:58.319 align:start position:0%
look at this and
 
02:35:01.030 --> 02:35:01.040 align:start position:0%
determine um you know is it answering
 
02:35:03.150 --> 02:35:03.160 align:start position:0%
those fundamental
 
02:35:05.950 --> 02:35:05.960 align:start position:0%
questions uh again in order to ensure
 
02:35:08.190 --> 02:35:08.200 align:start position:0%
the safety and security of our
 
02:35:13.950 --> 02:35:13.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:16.790 --> 02:35:16.800 align:start position:0%
to make accommodations for the person
 
02:35:19.070 --> 02:35:19.080 align:start position:0%
requesting the absentee ballot but also
 
02:35:21.230 --> 02:35:21.240 align:start position:0%
still have Level Playing Field for all
 
02:35:23.429 --> 02:35:23.439 align:start position:0%
voters having to go through the same
 
02:35:26.550 --> 02:35:26.560 align:start position:0%
sort of verification steps in the voting
 
02:35:29.910 --> 02:35:29.920 align:start position:0%
process so
 
02:35:32.429 --> 02:35:32.439 align:start position:0%
um it
 
02:35:32.439 --> 02:35:33.990 align:start position:0%
um it
it

02:35:33.990 --> 02:35:34.000 align:start position:0%
it
 
02:35:39.910 --> 02:35:39.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:44.750 --> 02:35:44.760 align:start position:0%
notorized and so it has some uh issues
 
02:35:44.760 --> 02:35:45.469 align:start position:0%
notorized and so it has some uh issues
with

02:35:45.469 --> 02:35:45.479 align:start position:0%
with
 
02:35:55.830 --> 02:35:55.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:57.710 --> 02:35:57.720 align:start position:0%
I I I
 
02:36:01.590 --> 02:36:01.600 align:start position:0%
guess you know my initial thoughts are
 
02:36:05.150 --> 02:36:05.160 align:start position:0%
if some election official or or town or
 
02:36:10.030 --> 02:36:10.040 align:start position:0%
city Ward official is not able to
 
02:36:13.230 --> 02:36:13.240 align:start position:0%
complete those
 
02:36:18.550 --> 02:36:18.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:22.389 --> 02:36:22.399 align:start position:0%
notorized an acceptable
 
02:36:25.830 --> 02:36:25.840 align:start position:0%
alternative they're not a election
 
02:36:29.389 --> 02:36:29.399 align:start position:0%
official but they have the they have
 
02:36:34.309 --> 02:36:34.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:37.830 --> 02:36:37.840 align:start position:0%
authenticate the identity of the
 
02:36:41.349 --> 02:36:41.359 align:start position:0%
voter and and some of these other
 
02:36:44.230 --> 02:36:44.240 align:start position:0%
qualification aspects that we might need
 
02:36:46.269 --> 02:36:46.279 align:start position:0%
u in that sort of circumstance I I need
 
02:36:48.269 --> 02:36:48.279 align:start position:0%
to think through this a little bit more
 
02:36:50.910 --> 02:36:50.920 align:start position:0%
but I think I just want to give the
 
02:36:53.950 --> 02:36:53.960 align:start position:0%
subcommittee an idea of where I'm
 
02:36:55.469 --> 02:36:55.479 align:start position:0%
thinking about this or I'm thinking
 
02:36:58.030 --> 02:36:58.040 align:start position:0%
about this I want to make sure we we
 
02:37:00.389 --> 02:37:00.399 align:start position:0%
answer the same questions for all voters
 
02:37:01.510 --> 02:37:01.520 align:start position:0%
in terms of
 
02:37:04.110 --> 02:37:04.120 align:start position:0%
verification but I also want to make
 
02:37:07.950 --> 02:37:07.960 align:start position:0%
sure um and and I want to make sure that
 
02:37:10.030 --> 02:37:10.040 align:start position:0%
if you know the normal processes if
 
02:37:12.269 --> 02:37:12.279 align:start position:0%
these can be done by election officials
 
02:37:15.110 --> 02:37:15.120 align:start position:0%
then they we shouldn't need an uh a
 
02:37:18.590 --> 02:37:18.600 align:start position:0%
notary um but in the absence of election
 
02:37:20.870 --> 02:37:20.880 align:start position:0%
officials or approach appropriate local
 
02:37:22.870 --> 02:37:22.880 align:start position:0%
government official officials or
 
02:37:27.269 --> 02:37:27.279 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State office officials um
 
02:37:29.950 --> 02:37:29.960 align:start position:0%
asking those same sorts of verification
 
02:37:34.870 --> 02:37:34.880 align:start position:0%
questions then um it it might be good to
 
02:37:36.790 --> 02:37:36.800 align:start position:0%
have the notary as an
 
02:37:36.800 --> 02:37:38.790 align:start position:0%
have the notary as an
alternative

02:37:38.790 --> 02:37:38.800 align:start position:0%
alternative
 
02:37:41.670 --> 02:37:41.680 align:start position:0%
to these other things if the other
 
02:37:45.070 --> 02:37:45.080 align:start position:0%
things cannot be obtained in those
 
02:37:48.110 --> 02:37:48.120 align:start position:0%
processes if that made any sense uh I
 
02:37:49.950 --> 02:37:49.960 align:start position:0%
see you you look
 
02:37:52.910 --> 02:37:52.920 align:start position:0%
me quizzically yeah no no it made sense
 
02:37:55.190 --> 02:37:55.200 align:start position:0%
I guess part of the problem of getting
 
02:37:57.630 --> 02:37:57.640 align:start position:0%
the C you know color copy or you know
 
02:38:01.590 --> 02:38:01.600 align:start position:0%
going out to get um a copy at Staples or
 
02:38:04.910 --> 02:38:04.920 align:start position:0%
wherever you might go to get one um is
 
02:38:06.590 --> 02:38:06.600 align:start position:0%
still you're still going to have to go
 
02:38:08.429 --> 02:38:08.439 align:start position:0%
out find a notary you're going to have
 
02:38:09.910 --> 02:38:09.920 align:start position:0%
to find somebody to come to your house
 
02:38:10.710 --> 02:38:10.720 align:start position:0%
you're going to have to be able to
 
02:38:13.750 --> 02:38:13.760 align:start position:0%
afford to pay them um and it just and I
 
02:38:15.389 --> 02:38:15.399 align:start position:0%
think somebody mentioned that might be a
 
02:38:17.750 --> 02:38:17.760 align:start position:0%
pole tax but I I don't know I'm not
 
02:38:21.670 --> 02:38:21.680 align:start position:0%
saying that but it just it it just seems
 
02:38:25.389 --> 02:38:25.399 align:start position:0%
like there are barriers being placed
 
02:38:28.510 --> 02:38:28.520 align:start position:0%
that we don't have now excuse me that we
 
02:38:31.670 --> 02:38:31.680 align:start position:0%
don't have now but yet no one has given
 
02:38:35.389 --> 02:38:35.399 align:start position:0%
us any evidence that this is really a
 
02:38:38.309 --> 02:38:38.319 align:start position:0%
problem so again I come back to are we
 
02:38:41.790 --> 02:38:41.800 align:start position:0%
really solving a problem here or are we
 
02:38:41.800 --> 02:38:45.070 align:start position:0%
really solving a problem here or are we
just

02:38:45.070 --> 02:38:45.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:47.230 --> 02:38:47.240 align:start position:0%
theorizing uh thank you representative
 
02:38:50.469 --> 02:38:50.479 align:start position:0%
Lane I I think my
 
02:38:53.190 --> 02:38:53.200 align:start position:0%
my response to that is I I I think we're
 
02:38:54.950 --> 02:38:54.960 align:start position:0%
trying to
 
02:38:58.710 --> 02:38:58.720 align:start position:0%
achieve a level of consistency of
 
02:39:02.190 --> 02:39:02.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:06.230 --> 02:39:06.240 align:start position:0%
we're again if if the the earlier
 
02:39:08.670 --> 02:39:08.680 align:start position:0%
remedies of town
 
02:39:12.750 --> 02:39:12.760 align:start position:0%
officials you know local government or
 
02:39:14.429 --> 02:39:14.439 align:start position:0%
state government Secretary of State's
 
02:39:15.590 --> 02:39:15.600 align:start position:0%
office for
 
02:39:18.389 --> 02:39:18.399 align:start position:0%
example cannot answer those verification
 
02:39:20.469 --> 02:39:20.479 align:start position:0%
questions who is going to do
 
02:39:23.269 --> 02:39:23.279 align:start position:0%
that perhaps and I'm I'm not saying that
 
02:39:26.389 --> 02:39:26.399 align:start position:0%
this is the solution but perhaps a
 
02:39:29.309 --> 02:39:29.319 align:start position:0%
notary public who can attest to the
 
02:39:31.070 --> 02:39:31.080 align:start position:0%
validity of the documents presented to
 
02:39:33.309 --> 02:39:33.319 align:start position:0%
that notary republic without color
 
02:39:35.630 --> 02:39:35.640 align:start position:0%
copies or what have you but they can
 
02:39:37.950 --> 02:39:37.960 align:start position:0%
attest to the authenticity of those
 
02:39:42.830 --> 02:39:42.840 align:start position:0%
documents and uh confirm that you know
 
02:39:44.389 --> 02:39:44.399 align:start position:0%
these things have been appropriately
 
02:39:46.830 --> 02:39:46.840 align:start position:0%
presented and then authenticate that
 
02:39:49.790 --> 02:39:49.800 align:start position:0%
through a notary I've only had a
 
02:39:51.230 --> 02:39:51.240 align:start position:0%
something notorized
 
02:39:55.190 --> 02:39:55.200 align:start position:0%
very infrequently so I'm going by memory
 
02:39:58.389 --> 02:39:58.399 align:start position:0%
which is over 10 years old at this point
 
02:40:02.389 --> 02:40:02.399 align:start position:0%
um and so you know in that case it might
 
02:40:05.550 --> 02:40:05.560 align:start position:0%
be it is something worth considering it
 
02:40:11.750 --> 02:40:11.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:15.110 --> 02:40:15.120 align:start position:0%
um the the only other option would be
 
02:40:20.630 --> 02:40:20.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:23.070 --> 02:40:23.080 align:start position:0%
you know we would have to look at you
 
02:40:27.990 --> 02:40:28.000 align:start position:0%
know how can we then confirm
 
02:40:30.670 --> 02:40:30.680 align:start position:0%
these you know qualifications if they're
 
02:40:33.309 --> 02:40:33.319 align:start position:0%
if they're registering or identity if
 
02:40:33.319 --> 02:40:34.150 align:start position:0%
if they're registering or identity if
they're

02:40:34.150 --> 02:40:34.160 align:start position:0%
they're
 
02:40:37.309 --> 02:40:37.319 align:start position:0%
voting um or you know checking in a
 
02:40:39.150 --> 02:40:39.160 align:start position:0%
sensibly to obtain the ballot if they've
 
02:40:39.160 --> 02:40:39.990 align:start position:0%
sensibly to obtain the ballot if they've
already

02:40:39.990 --> 02:40:40.000 align:start position:0%
already
 
02:40:44.230 --> 02:40:44.240 align:start position:0%
pre-registered how can we confirm those
 
02:40:47.190 --> 02:40:47.200 align:start position:0%
in in a manner
 
02:40:50.429 --> 02:40:50.439 align:start position:0%
uh that Prov provides the same level of
 
02:40:52.670 --> 02:40:52.680 align:start position:0%
verification that you know the
 
02:40:54.790 --> 02:40:54.800 align:start position:0%
pre-registered election day voter goes
 
02:40:57.389 --> 02:40:57.399 align:start position:0%
through so I think again that that is
 
02:41:00.190 --> 02:41:00.200 align:start position:0%
just sort of my uh forgive me simplistic
 
02:41:03.150 --> 02:41:03.160 align:start position:0%
way of looking at this but I think if we
 
02:41:07.469 --> 02:41:07.479 align:start position:0%
can uh Endeavor to kind of make sure we
 
02:41:10.590 --> 02:41:10.600 align:start position:0%
have that Level Playing Field and then
 
02:41:12.790 --> 02:41:12.800 align:start position:0%
for those who have unusual
 
02:41:15.269 --> 02:41:15.279 align:start position:0%
circumstances um if accommodations need
 
02:41:17.750 --> 02:41:17.760 align:start position:0%
to be made make accommodations but then
 
02:41:19.389 --> 02:41:19.399 align:start position:0%
also make sure that those accommod
 
02:41:19.399 --> 02:41:20.469 align:start position:0%
also make sure that those accommod
ations

02:41:20.469 --> 02:41:20.479 align:start position:0%
ations
 
02:41:23.630 --> 02:41:23.640 align:start position:0%
are uh sufficient to fulfill the
 
02:41:26.790 --> 02:41:26.800 align:start position:0%
verification requirements so I I'm still
 
02:41:28.950 --> 02:41:28.960 align:start position:0%
processing this need to think about this
 
02:41:32.990 --> 02:41:33.000 align:start position:0%
but I think I think that's
 
02:41:36.269 --> 02:41:36.279 align:start position:0%
um I'm not I'm not saying
 
02:41:40.790 --> 02:41:40.800 align:start position:0%
that uh I I don't believe that
 
02:41:44.030 --> 02:41:44.040 align:start position:0%
notorized for every absentee B so I
 
02:41:46.070 --> 02:41:46.080 align:start position:0%
think that's very clear but I think it
 
02:41:48.269 --> 02:41:48.279 align:start position:0%
could be an option again when these
 
02:41:50.469 --> 02:41:50.479 align:start position:0%
other verification components are not
 
02:41:53.429 --> 02:41:53.439 align:start position:0%
being uh fulfilled through election
 
02:41:56.950 --> 02:41:56.960 align:start position:0%
officials or state officials how how can
 
02:41:58.950 --> 02:41:58.960 align:start position:0%
we how
 
02:42:02.230 --> 02:42:02.240 align:start position:0%
can how do I know that
 
02:42:06.790 --> 02:42:06.800 align:start position:0%
my my vote is not disenfranchised by an
 
02:42:08.429 --> 02:42:08.439 align:start position:0%
absentee ballot that hasn't been
 
02:42:11.550 --> 02:42:11.560 align:start position:0%
properly verified or you know identified
 
02:42:16.670 --> 02:42:16.680 align:start position:0%
and so it's it's the risk is you know do
 
02:42:19.429 --> 02:42:19.439 align:start position:0%
do I know whether or not
 
02:42:24.550 --> 02:42:24.560 align:start position:0%
it's authentic and and um so um those
 
02:42:27.150 --> 02:42:27.160 align:start position:0%
are my my thoughts on the matter uh I I
 
02:42:29.469 --> 02:42:29.479 align:start position:0%
see my colleagues to the right who I've
 
02:42:32.230 --> 02:42:32.240 align:start position:0%
I I have not in I've been speaking to
 
02:42:34.710 --> 02:42:34.720 align:start position:0%
the left side of the room here I or my
 
02:42:37.510 --> 02:42:37.520 align:start position:0%
left side of I you asked the question so
 
02:42:40.910 --> 02:42:40.920 align:start position:0%
I apologize but uh um he was first he
 
02:42:42.990 --> 02:42:43.000 align:start position:0%
was first all right so representative C
 
02:42:44.670 --> 02:42:44.680 align:start position:0%
what wisdom can you impart to this
 
02:42:46.870 --> 02:42:46.880 align:start position:0%
subcommittee okay you touched on part of
 
02:42:49.950 --> 02:42:49.960 align:start position:0%
this was uh uh
 
02:42:51.990 --> 02:42:52.000 align:start position:0%
on the color copies and stuff like that
 
02:42:54.469 --> 02:42:54.479 align:start position:0%
if you're having somebody notorized it
 
02:42:56.750 --> 02:42:56.760 align:start position:0%
if they can see your driver's license or
 
02:42:59.230 --> 02:42:59.240 align:start position:0%
whatever ID you're using it doesn't have
 
02:43:01.830 --> 02:43:01.840 align:start position:0%
to have a copy
 
02:43:05.190 --> 02:43:05.200 align:start position:0%
um the concern I have
 
02:43:05.200 --> 02:43:06.990 align:start position:0%
um the concern I have
is

02:43:06.990 --> 02:43:07.000 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:43:10.190 --> 02:43:10.200 align:start position:0%
um this application I believe is for
 
02:43:12.630 --> 02:43:12.640 align:start position:0%
somebody who has already registered to
 
02:43:16.030 --> 02:43:16.040 align:start position:0%
vote so at that point we're only trying
 
02:43:18.309 --> 02:43:18.319 align:start position:0%
to identify that it's the correct person
 
02:43:22.309 --> 02:43:22.319 align:start position:0%
who's requesting the absentee ballot and
 
02:43:24.349 --> 02:43:24.359 align:start position:0%
not part of this but when they send the
 
02:43:26.230 --> 02:43:26.240 align:start position:0%
ballot back we need to make sure that
 
02:43:28.429 --> 02:43:28.439 align:start position:0%
the ballot came from that same
 
02:43:31.309 --> 02:43:31.319 align:start position:0%
person uh
 
02:43:35.150 --> 02:43:35.160 align:start position:0%
so uh the other part was the distinction
 
02:43:39.870 --> 02:43:39.880 align:start position:0%
of if they apply in person at Town
 
02:43:43.110 --> 02:43:43.120 align:start position:0%
Hall they uh the town clerk should be
 
02:43:44.990 --> 02:43:45.000 align:start position:0%
able to take care of all that and it
 
02:43:49.510 --> 02:43:49.520 align:start position:0%
should not necessarily be notorized um
 
02:43:53.110 --> 02:43:53.120 align:start position:0%
it's only if they're mailing in the
 
02:43:56.349 --> 02:43:56.359 align:start position:0%
application from wherever they might be
 
02:44:00.870 --> 02:44:00.880 align:start position:0%
to get a ballot sent to them that the
 
02:44:02.870 --> 02:44:02.880 align:start position:0%
question comes up of the identity of the
 
02:44:05.070 --> 02:44:05.080 align:start position:0%
person mailing it in but I think the
 
02:44:05.080 --> 02:44:06.230 align:start position:0%
person mailing it in but I think the
biggest

02:44:06.230 --> 02:44:06.240 align:start position:0%
biggest
 
02:44:10.590 --> 02:44:10.600 align:start position:0%
concern for absentee voting is making
 
02:44:13.830 --> 02:44:13.840 align:start position:0%
sure that the ballot
 
02:44:17.150 --> 02:44:17.160 align:start position:0%
itself is from the correct person I'm
 
02:44:20.309 --> 02:44:20.319 align:start position:0%
not as worried about uh who's applying
 
02:44:20.319 --> 02:44:24.349 align:start position:0%
not as worried about uh who's applying
for

02:44:24.349 --> 02:44:24.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:27.150 --> 02:44:27.160 align:start position:0%
it all right thank you representative C
 
02:44:29.630 --> 02:44:29.640 align:start position:0%
appreciate those comments um
 
02:44:33.469 --> 02:44:33.479 align:start position:0%
representative brunham thank you
 
02:44:36.389 --> 02:44:36.399 align:start position:0%
um and I might be opening a can of worms
 
02:44:36.399 --> 02:44:38.070 align:start position:0%
um and I might be opening a can of worms
here

02:44:38.070 --> 02:44:38.080 align:start position:0%
here
 
02:44:40.830 --> 02:44:40.840 align:start position:0%
but today we have technology we have
 
02:44:42.469 --> 02:44:42.479 align:start position:0%
phone devices where we could take a
 
02:44:43.870 --> 02:44:43.880 align:start position:0%
picture of a person we could take a
 
02:44:47.190 --> 02:44:47.200 align:start position:0%
picture of an ID it's colorful it's
 
02:44:49.510 --> 02:44:49.520 align:start position:0%
beautiful how is it possible that it
 
02:44:56.150 --> 02:44:56.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:58.870 --> 02:44:58.880 align:start position:0%
legal that is a that is a good question
 
02:45:03.070 --> 02:45:03.080 align:start position:0%
we should um certainly um the banking
 
02:45:07.590 --> 02:45:07.600 align:start position:0%
industry and the uh Finance Industries
 
02:45:11.990 --> 02:45:12.000 align:start position:0%
have uh extensive means of identity
 
02:45:15.590 --> 02:45:15.600 align:start position:0%
verification that are in use
 
02:45:20.389 --> 02:45:20.399 align:start position:0%
today um and provide
 
02:45:22.990 --> 02:45:23.000 align:start position:0%
uh ostensibly very
 
02:45:25.950 --> 02:45:25.960 align:start position:0%
secure confirmation and verification
 
02:45:30.910 --> 02:45:30.920 align:start position:0%
authentication of identities so
 
02:45:34.469 --> 02:45:34.479 align:start position:0%
um you know Perhaps Perhaps that is
 
02:45:34.479 --> 02:45:35.550 align:start position:0%
um you know Perhaps Perhaps that is
something

02:45:35.550 --> 02:45:35.560 align:start position:0%
something
 
02:45:35.560 --> 02:45:36.620 align:start position:0%
something
for

02:45:36.620 --> 02:45:36.630 align:start position:0%
for
 
02:45:36.630 --> 02:45:39.349 align:start position:0%
for
[Music]

02:45:39.349 --> 02:45:39.359 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:45:42.630 --> 02:45:42.640 align:start position:0%
um perhaps that is something for future
 
02:45:42.640 --> 02:45:44.510 align:start position:0%
um perhaps that is something for future
consideration

02:45:44.510 --> 02:45:44.520 align:start position:0%
consideration
 
02:45:50.790 --> 02:45:50.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:52.990 --> 02:45:53.000 align:start position:0%
I I'm I'm guessing that that would
 
02:45:55.349 --> 02:45:55.359 align:start position:0%
probably have to be done at the state
 
02:46:02.389 --> 02:46:02.399 align:start position:0%
level and so um yeah so yeah she's
 
02:46:10.230 --> 02:46:10.240 align:start position:0%
so so uh so um uh so uh deputy secretary
 
02:46:13.910 --> 02:46:13.920 align:start position:0%
Hennessy um I not I'm not sure we we um
 
02:46:16.710 --> 02:46:16.720 align:start position:0%
need you to answer any questions but
 
02:46:19.750 --> 02:46:19.760 align:start position:0%
we're um in our discussion if I may
 
02:46:23.550 --> 02:46:23.560 align:start position:0%
summarize for you um we were
 
02:46:26.269 --> 02:46:26.279 align:start position:0%
discussing the fact that the banking
 
02:46:28.230 --> 02:46:28.240 align:start position:0%
industry the finance Industries have a
 
02:46:31.349 --> 02:46:31.359 align:start position:0%
lot of remote identity identity
 
02:46:35.230 --> 02:46:35.240 align:start position:0%
authentication technology in use today
 
02:46:37.670 --> 02:46:37.680 align:start position:0%
um you know every people can do remote
 
02:46:39.389 --> 02:46:39.399 align:start position:0%
Banking and people can
 
02:46:43.910 --> 02:46:43.920 align:start position:0%
do uh remote other things with financial
 
02:46:43.920 --> 02:46:46.030 align:start position:0%
do uh remote other things with financial
people

02:46:46.030 --> 02:46:46.040 align:start position:0%
people
 
02:46:49.790 --> 02:46:49.800 align:start position:0%
um um and
 
02:46:52.830 --> 02:46:52.840 align:start position:0%
therefore that that
 
02:46:56.710 --> 02:46:56.720 align:start position:0%
is uh you know certainly a technology
 
02:46:59.750 --> 02:46:59.760 align:start position:0%
option that we could consider I it is
 
02:47:01.469 --> 02:47:01.479 align:start position:0%
not something that I would ever want to
 
02:47:04.870 --> 02:47:04.880 align:start position:0%
consider at a local level because
 
02:47:09.630 --> 02:47:09.640 align:start position:0%
of uh the cost and mandating it to the
 
02:47:13.469 --> 02:47:13.479 align:start position:0%
local towns and City Wards um and
 
02:47:18.510 --> 02:47:18.520 align:start position:0%
also um they certainly don't have the if
 
02:47:20.230 --> 02:47:20.240 align:start position:0%
you will the cyber
 
02:47:22.990 --> 02:47:23.000 align:start position:0%
security uh vigilance NE they don't
 
02:47:26.630 --> 02:47:26.640 align:start position:0%
necessarily I don't want to um uh diss
 
02:47:29.110 --> 02:47:29.120 align:start position:0%
any of our local it folks but they don't
 
02:47:31.830 --> 02:47:31.840 align:start position:0%
necessarily have the full cyber security
 
02:47:34.710 --> 02:47:34.720 align:start position:0%
uh capabilities that say the state of
 
02:47:37.389 --> 02:47:37.399 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire might have and so it would
 
02:47:43.389 --> 02:47:43.399 align:start position:0%
seem that um one possible alternative to
 
02:47:43.399 --> 02:47:45.469 align:start position:0%
seem that um one possible alternative to
this

02:47:45.469 --> 02:47:45.479 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:47:48.510 --> 02:47:48.520 align:start position:0%
identification um for the purposes of
 
02:47:51.030 --> 02:47:51.040 align:start position:0%
submit sub mitting an absentee ballot
 
02:47:54.349 --> 02:47:54.359 align:start position:0%
could be um technology that would come
 
02:47:55.950 --> 02:47:55.960 align:start position:0%
through the Secretary of State's office
 
02:47:59.070 --> 02:47:59.080 align:start position:0%
of course this would require of Finance
 
02:48:02.150 --> 02:48:02.160 align:start position:0%
uh commitment and other Provisions no
 
02:48:03.990 --> 02:48:04.000 align:start position:0%
doubt we would have to think more
 
02:48:05.750 --> 02:48:05.760 align:start position:0%
thoroughly about what that would entail
 
02:48:08.230 --> 02:48:08.240 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure it's um something that we
 
02:48:11.670 --> 02:48:11.680 align:start position:0%
could do in this term because of the
 
02:48:15.670 --> 02:48:15.680 align:start position:0%
finance bills having to be in already um
 
02:48:17.990 --> 02:48:18.000 align:start position:0%
but that's something for future
 
02:48:21.150 --> 02:48:21.160 align:start position:0%
consideration and I I think that's
 
02:48:23.870 --> 02:48:23.880 align:start position:0%
that's um good but we're we're sort of
 
02:48:26.110 --> 02:48:26.120 align:start position:0%
checking down our list of
 
02:48:29.150 --> 02:48:29.160 align:start position:0%
Alternatives you know directly with the
 
02:48:31.990 --> 02:48:32.000 align:start position:0%
local state or directly with the local
 
02:48:34.870 --> 02:48:34.880 align:start position:0%
Town officials or election officials uh
 
02:48:36.710 --> 02:48:36.720 align:start position:0%
perhaps with the Secretary of State's
 
02:48:40.190 --> 02:48:40.200 align:start position:0%
office um maybe in absence of those two
 
02:48:42.230 --> 02:48:42.240 align:start position:0%
things and a
 
02:48:46.910 --> 02:48:46.920 align:start position:0%
notorized C's point if if we're asking
 
02:48:49.030 --> 02:48:49.040 align:start position:0%
um really for an identification
 
02:48:51.590 --> 02:48:51.600 align:start position:0%
associated with the ballot at this point
 
02:48:55.070 --> 02:48:55.080 align:start position:0%
um is that the right mechanism and then
 
02:48:57.070 --> 02:48:57.080 align:start position:0%
and then we got into the discussion
 
02:49:00.150 --> 02:49:00.160 align:start position:0%
about uh Banking and finance technology
 
02:49:02.550 --> 02:49:02.560 align:start position:0%
that could authenticate identities as
 
02:49:05.230 --> 02:49:05.240 align:start position:0%
well so there's a lot of different
 
02:49:06.590 --> 02:49:06.600 align:start position:0%
points discussed I don't think we'll
 
02:49:08.269 --> 02:49:08.279 align:start position:0%
come to any conclusions but we will come
 
02:49:11.870 --> 02:49:11.880 align:start position:0%
to the end of the meeting shortly so um
 
02:49:14.070 --> 02:49:14.080 align:start position:0%
so um I'm not sure we're going to
 
02:49:18.030 --> 02:49:18.040 align:start position:0%
resolve anything here I think um the
 
02:49:21.870 --> 02:49:21.880 align:start position:0%
points of about um the wording for
 
02:49:24.710 --> 02:49:24.720 align:start position:0%
notorized is uh
 
02:49:26.790 --> 02:49:26.800 align:start position:0%
inappropriate it would have to be have
 
02:49:30.030 --> 02:49:30.040 align:start position:0%
notorized um and that sort of thing and
 
02:49:32.710 --> 02:49:32.720 align:start position:0%
um so I think we'll need to go back and
 
02:49:34.429 --> 02:49:34.439 align:start position:0%
and look at this a little further and
 
02:49:34.439 --> 02:49:36.229 align:start position:0%
and look at this a little further and
see

02:49:36.229 --> 02:49:36.239 align:start position:0%
see
 
02:49:38.790 --> 02:49:38.800 align:start position:0%
um what can best be done with this
 
02:49:40.790 --> 02:49:40.800 align:start position:0%
particular bill but but I think this was
 
02:49:43.030 --> 02:49:43.040 align:start position:0%
a good discussion a lot of different
 
02:49:44.910 --> 02:49:44.920 align:start position:0%
points were
 
02:49:48.870 --> 02:49:48.880 align:start position:0%
raised um um representative we yes I
 
02:49:50.830 --> 02:49:50.840 align:start position:0%
just want to follow up on representative
 
02:49:55.229 --> 02:49:55.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:58.950 --> 02:49:58.960 align:start position:0%
um you could take a picture and then
 
02:50:01.910 --> 02:50:01.920 align:start position:0%
send it you know send it via email as
 
02:50:05.710 --> 02:50:05.720 align:start position:0%
part to the clerk so I mean again that
 
02:50:09.150 --> 02:50:09.160 align:start position:0%
would require a computer and some some
 
02:50:11.670 --> 02:50:11.680 align:start position:0%
technological expertise which not
 
02:50:15.070 --> 02:50:15.080 align:start position:0%
everybody has but you know um but I
 
02:50:17.110 --> 02:50:17.120 align:start position:0%
think from a if you're thinking about
 
02:50:17.120 --> 02:50:18.870 align:start position:0%
think from a if you're thinking about
alternatives

02:50:18.870 --> 02:50:18.880 align:start position:0%
alternatives
 
02:50:21.910 --> 02:50:21.920 align:start position:0%
um Dan Healey who's was speaking for the
 
02:50:24.750 --> 02:50:24.760 align:start position:0%
clerk's Association he says most of his
 
02:50:26.790 --> 02:50:26.800 align:start position:0%
requests come in via
 
02:50:30.070 --> 02:50:30.080 align:start position:0%
email rather than letter so if you're
 
02:50:33.150 --> 02:50:33.160 align:start position:0%
emailing the request you could perhaps
 
02:50:37.550 --> 02:50:37.560 align:start position:0%
attach you know but um it's an image
 
02:50:39.389 --> 02:50:39.399 align:start position:0%
really it's not technically a copy I
 
02:50:42.990 --> 02:50:43.000 align:start position:0%
guess but um but maybe we have to look
 
02:50:46.870 --> 02:50:46.880 align:start position:0%
at that I'm I'm I'm still not sold on
 
02:50:49.469 --> 02:50:49.479 align:start position:0%
that we need to do this but um um but if
 
02:50:52.710 --> 02:50:52.720 align:start position:0%
we're going to do it that's another way
 
02:50:57.269 --> 02:50:57.279 align:start position:0%
to offer another alternative um and I I
 
02:51:00.309 --> 02:51:00.319 align:start position:0%
guess I will just stop
 
02:51:03.910 --> 02:51:03.920 align:start position:0%
there well I guess I I won't stop there
 
02:51:07.389 --> 02:51:07.399 align:start position:0%
um I would say that it it's a I think
 
02:51:10.150 --> 02:51:10.160 align:start position:0%
the goal is to have basically how to
 
02:51:12.790 --> 02:51:12.800 align:start position:0%
obtain an absentee ballot match how to
 
02:51:15.309 --> 02:51:15.319 align:start position:0%
obtain a ballot in person is the goal
 
02:51:18.630 --> 02:51:18.640 align:start position:0%
here and I would say that since we have
 
02:51:20.790 --> 02:51:20.800 align:start position:0%
no evidence of fraud happening at the
 
02:51:24.630 --> 02:51:24.640 align:start position:0%
absentee ballot level without IDs to
 
02:51:27.550 --> 02:51:27.560 align:start position:0%
then instead of strengthening that or
 
02:51:30.150 --> 02:51:30.160 align:start position:0%
making it harder or however to Define
 
02:51:33.710 --> 02:51:33.720 align:start position:0%
that is to then make the in-person match
 
02:51:35.990 --> 02:51:36.000 align:start position:0%
what we currently have which is an
 
02:51:38.389 --> 02:51:38.399 align:start position:0%
affidavit which is what we had several
 
02:51:40.590 --> 02:51:40.600 align:start position:0%
years ago and that way if you don't have
 
02:51:43.030 --> 02:51:43.040 align:start position:0%
that ID in person you're back to the
 
02:51:46.469 --> 02:51:46.479 align:start position:0%
affidavit and the two different uh
 
02:51:49.750 --> 02:51:49.760 align:start position:0%
methods of voting uh and getting that b
 
02:51:51.870 --> 02:51:51.880 align:start position:0%
not voting of obtaining the ballot
 
02:51:54.030 --> 02:51:54.040 align:start position:0%
whether it's in person or absentee those
 
02:51:56.750 --> 02:51:56.760 align:start position:0%
two methods would match up at that point
 
02:51:59.269 --> 02:51:59.279 align:start position:0%
which would easily and
 
02:52:03.309 --> 02:52:03.319 align:start position:0%
cheapest um solve this that
 
02:52:05.990 --> 02:52:06.000 align:start position:0%
issue I I thank you representative
 
02:52:08.070 --> 02:52:08.080 align:start position:0%
Newsome I think that that's an
 
02:52:10.910 --> 02:52:10.920 align:start position:0%
interesting point I think um if if we
 
02:52:12.229 --> 02:52:12.239 align:start position:0%
were still
 
02:52:15.150 --> 02:52:15.160 align:start position:0%
doing um the traditional legal
 
02:52:17.150 --> 02:52:17.160 align:start position:0%
definitions of affidavit I I would
 
02:52:19.229 --> 02:52:19.239 align:start position:0%
certainly agree that that would be
 
02:52:23.670 --> 02:52:23.680 align:start position:0%
good as we heard from uh I think uh Mr
 
02:52:27.389 --> 02:52:27.399 align:start position:0%
Richard in in the election law committee
 
02:52:30.990 --> 02:52:31.000 align:start position:0%
testimonies uh a couple of sessions ago
 
02:52:33.830 --> 02:52:33.840 align:start position:0%
um he he pointed out that currently what
 
02:52:35.750 --> 02:52:35.760 align:start position:0%
we're calling an affid is more of a
 
02:52:40.190 --> 02:52:40.200 align:start position:0%
self-verification and so I think
 
02:52:43.229 --> 02:52:43.239 align:start position:0%
um I I want to avoid
 
02:52:43.239 --> 02:52:45.150 align:start position:0%
um I I want to avoid
um

02:52:45.150 --> 02:52:45.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:52:48.910 --> 02:52:48.920 align:start position:0%
uh turning the check-in process into a a
 
02:52:52.630 --> 02:52:52.640 align:start position:0%
cold porter musical anything goes so
 
02:52:55.190 --> 02:52:55.200 align:start position:0%
um I think we have to be a little
 
02:52:59.389 --> 02:52:59.399 align:start position:0%
careful uh of sliding backwards on on
 
02:53:02.070 --> 02:53:02.080 align:start position:0%
the uh in-person check-in versus
 
02:53:04.630 --> 02:53:04.640 align:start position:0%
tightening up the absentee balance of
 
02:53:05.630 --> 02:53:05.640 align:start position:0%
course this
 
02:53:10.110 --> 02:53:10.120 align:start position:0%
is uh the direct Direction I I sort of
 
02:53:12.790 --> 02:53:12.800 align:start position:0%
lean toward and you're certainly right
 
02:53:14.990 --> 02:53:15.000 align:start position:0%
to uh want to lean in other directions
 
02:53:16.590 --> 02:53:16.600 align:start position:0%
from me
 
02:53:19.870 --> 02:53:19.880 align:start position:0%
so um all
 
02:53:22.830 --> 02:53:22.840 align:start position:0%
right any uh are there any further
 
02:53:27.389 --> 02:53:27.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:30.030 --> 02:53:30.040 align:start position:0%
point in that case uh would I hear a
 
02:53:31.870 --> 02:53:31.880 align:start position:0%
motion to adjourn for the day and we
 
02:53:35.870 --> 02:53:35.880 align:start position:0%
will res resume uh next week so moved
 
02:53:39.830 --> 02:53:39.840 align:start position:0%
