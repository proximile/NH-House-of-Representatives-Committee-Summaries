01:02:56.710 --> 01:02:56.720 align:start position:0%
welcome back we missed you
 
01:02:59.349 --> 01:02:59.359 align:start position:0%
well good morning madam chair and good
 
01:03:01.270 --> 01:03:01.280 align:start position:0%
morning to the committee
 
01:03:04.950 --> 01:03:04.960 align:start position:0%
for the record my name is karen ebel i
 
01:03:07.589 --> 01:03:07.599 align:start position:0%
represent merrimack district five which
 
01:03:11.029 --> 01:03:11.039 align:start position:0%
is new london and newbury
 
01:03:14.470 --> 01:03:14.480 align:start position:0%
and i'm here this morning to introduce
 
01:03:18.630 --> 01:03:18.640 align:start position:0%
hb 1274 which would establish a study
 
01:03:21.190 --> 01:03:21.200 align:start position:0%
committee to review the solid waste
 
01:03:23.510 --> 01:03:23.520 align:start position:0%
practices of our state
 
01:03:23.520 --> 01:03:24.950 align:start position:0%
practices of our state
agencies

01:03:24.950 --> 01:03:24.960 align:start position:0%
agencies
 
01:03:26.870 --> 01:03:26.880 align:start position:0%
i think at this point everybody has
 
01:03:29.270 --> 01:03:29.280 align:start position:0%
heard quite a bit about the solid waste
 
01:03:31.910 --> 01:03:31.920 align:start position:0%
situation in the state of new hampshire
 
01:03:34.950 --> 01:03:34.960 align:start position:0%
and how many of the states in our region
 
01:03:37.190 --> 01:03:37.200 align:start position:0%
are really making a lot of advancements
 
01:03:39.109 --> 01:03:39.119 align:start position:0%
and trying to divert
 
01:03:41.029 --> 01:03:41.039 align:start position:0%
the amount of solid waste that's going
 
01:03:44.549 --> 01:03:44.559 align:start position:0%
in into their landfills away into more
 
01:03:49.270 --> 01:03:49.280 align:start position:0%
recycling or a reduction of use
 
01:03:52.710 --> 01:03:52.720 align:start position:0%
i just as a starting point i wanted to
 
01:03:52.720 --> 01:03:53.829 align:start position:0%
i just as a starting point i wanted to
mention

01:03:53.829 --> 01:03:53.839 align:start position:0%
mention
 
01:03:58.230 --> 01:03:58.240 align:start position:0%
that hb 1274 is based is virtually
 
01:04:01.589 --> 01:04:01.599 align:start position:0%
identical to hb 1706 which is a bill
 
01:04:05.349 --> 01:04:05.359 align:start position:0%
that i introduced in 2020
 
01:04:08.390 --> 01:04:08.400 align:start position:0%
the passage was unanimously recommended
 
01:04:11.109 --> 01:04:11.119 align:start position:0%
by this committee and the bill passed on
 
01:04:13.750 --> 01:04:13.760 align:start position:0%
the house consent calendar
 
01:04:15.990 --> 01:04:16.000 align:start position:0%
but along with other bills
 
01:04:18.309 --> 01:04:18.319 align:start position:0%
during the covet days it was laid on the
 
01:04:21.430 --> 01:04:21.440 align:start position:0%
table by the senate so it has passed the
 
01:04:24.789 --> 01:04:24.799 align:start position:0%
house once unanimously
 
01:04:28.789 --> 01:04:28.799 align:start position:0%
i think just by way of background
 
01:04:31.990 --> 01:04:32.000 align:start position:0%
you may recall back in 2019 china
 
01:04:35.430 --> 01:04:35.440 align:start position:0%
decided to stop taking a lot of our
 
01:04:38.230 --> 01:04:38.240 align:start position:0%
solid waste and recycled goods
 
01:04:42.069 --> 01:04:42.079 align:start position:0%
and that put the problem that we have
 
01:04:44.150 --> 01:04:44.160 align:start position:0%
with our solid waste really in sharp
 
01:04:47.589 --> 01:04:47.599 align:start position:0%
focus the towns in particular that uh
 
01:04:49.750 --> 01:04:49.760 align:start position:0%
did single stream where you put all your
 
01:04:52.230 --> 01:04:52.240 align:start position:0%
recycling into one bucket and it has to
 
01:04:56.470 --> 01:04:56.480 align:start position:0%
be sorted were particularly hit because
 
01:04:59.270 --> 01:04:59.280 align:start position:0%
a lot of that ultimately did end up
 
01:05:01.910 --> 01:05:01.920 align:start position:0%
going to china and that stopped
 
01:05:04.230 --> 01:05:04.240 align:start position:0%
so during that period that's when i
 
01:05:06.950 --> 01:05:06.960 align:start position:0%
decided to introduce a bill to
 
01:05:09.349 --> 01:05:09.359 align:start position:0%
alleged to create a legislative study
 
01:05:09.359 --> 01:05:10.549 align:start position:0%
alleged to create a legislative study
committee

01:05:10.549 --> 01:05:10.559 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:05:15.109 --> 01:05:15.119 align:start position:0%
the hb 617s recycling and solid waste
 
01:05:17.750 --> 01:05:17.760 align:start position:0%
management committee
 
01:05:19.190 --> 01:05:19.200 align:start position:0%
and we did
 
01:05:22.710 --> 01:05:22.720 align:start position:0%
a lot of work in an eight week period we
 
01:05:25.349 --> 01:05:25.359 align:start position:0%
had about 50 stakeholders
 
01:05:27.589 --> 01:05:27.599 align:start position:0%
and we heard a lot about a lot of the
 
01:05:30.230 --> 01:05:30.240 align:start position:0%
problems that our municipalities
 
01:05:32.789 --> 01:05:32.799 align:start position:0%
and our businesses were having with
 
01:05:35.750 --> 01:05:35.760 align:start position:0%
waste and really the effect on property
 
01:05:37.430 --> 01:05:37.440 align:start position:0%
taxes overall
 
01:05:39.829 --> 01:05:39.839 align:start position:0%
but among the stakeholders that came in
 
01:05:42.789 --> 01:05:42.799 align:start position:0%
to speak with us was the department of
 
01:05:45.510 --> 01:05:45.520 align:start position:0%
admin administrative services
 
01:05:45.520 --> 01:05:47.990 align:start position:0%
admin administrative services
and

01:05:47.990 --> 01:05:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:48.950 align:start position:0%
 
we

01:05:48.950 --> 01:05:48.960 align:start position:0%
we
 
01:05:51.990 --> 01:05:52.000 align:start position:0%
did put together a really comprehensive
 
01:05:53.589 --> 01:05:53.599 align:start position:0%
report on
 
01:05:55.270 --> 01:05:55.280 align:start position:0%
our findings
 
01:05:56.870 --> 01:05:56.880 align:start position:0%
but one of the
 
01:05:58.150 --> 01:05:58.160 align:start position:0%
things that
 
01:06:00.710 --> 01:06:00.720 align:start position:0%
i felt and the committee felt was that
 
01:06:03.190 --> 01:06:03.200 align:start position:0%
we really didn't have adequate time to
 
01:06:05.670 --> 01:06:05.680 align:start position:0%
delve more deeply into
 
01:06:08.470 --> 01:06:08.480 align:start position:0%
how our executive branch how our state
 
01:06:11.430 --> 01:06:11.440 align:start position:0%
agencies deal with their solid waste
 
01:06:14.309 --> 01:06:14.319 align:start position:0%
there is a statute which i mentioned in
 
01:06:14.319 --> 01:06:15.430 align:start position:0%
there is a statute which i mentioned in
my

01:06:15.430 --> 01:06:15.440 align:start position:0%
my
 
01:06:19.190 --> 01:06:19.200 align:start position:0%
in my testimony rsa9 hyphen c
 
01:06:22.069 --> 01:06:22.079 align:start position:0%
which relates to solid waste
 
01:06:22.079 --> 01:06:22.870 align:start position:0%
which relates to solid waste
and

01:06:22.870 --> 01:06:22.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:06:25.670 --> 01:06:25.680 align:start position:0%
the recycling programs in fact it's
 
01:06:27.589 --> 01:06:27.599 align:start position:0%
entitled state government waste
 
01:06:30.789 --> 01:06:30.799 align:start position:0%
reduction recycling and recycled
 
01:06:33.430 --> 01:06:33.440 align:start position:0%
products purchase
 
01:06:36.390 --> 01:06:36.400 align:start position:0%
and there's a whole chapter on
 
01:06:39.750 --> 01:06:39.760 align:start position:0%
on solid waste and what the executive
 
01:06:43.750 --> 01:06:43.760 align:start position:0%
branch does with it i also provided to
 
01:06:46.789 --> 01:06:46.799 align:start position:0%
you in my testimony a memorandum that
 
01:06:50.230 --> 01:06:50.240 align:start position:0%
was prepared by das in fact
 
01:06:51.829 --> 01:06:51.839 align:start position:0%
amy farnham
 
01:06:55.430 --> 01:06:55.440 align:start position:0%
i invited to be here today from das she
 
01:06:58.829 --> 01:06:58.839 align:start position:0%
did write the memo and it gives a good
 
01:07:01.029 --> 01:07:01.039 align:start position:0%
overview of the
 
01:07:03.990 --> 01:07:04.000 align:start position:0%
of the program that's administered by
 
01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:06.069 align:start position:0%
of the program that's administered by
das

01:07:06.069 --> 01:07:06.079 align:start position:0%
das
 
01:07:07.589 --> 01:07:07.599 align:start position:0%
i i
 
01:07:09.910 --> 01:07:09.920 align:start position:0%
understand that das is not planning on
 
01:07:13.029 --> 01:07:13.039 align:start position:0%
before our hb 617 committee
 
01:07:16.230 --> 01:07:16.240 align:start position:0%
and in the memorandum that amy prepared
 
01:07:19.109 --> 01:07:19.119 align:start position:0%
is that although the statutes created a
 
01:07:22.309 --> 01:07:22.319 align:start position:0%
recycling program the recycling program
 
01:07:24.630 --> 01:07:24.640 align:start position:0%
is a centralized program
 
01:07:28.870 --> 01:07:28.880 align:start position:0%
and much of the solid waste disposal and
 
01:07:32.630 --> 01:07:32.640 align:start position:0%
mechanisms are done agency by agency so
 
01:07:35.589 --> 01:07:35.599 align:start position:0%
it's a decentralized program and it's
 
01:07:35.599 --> 01:07:36.789 align:start position:0%
it's a decentralized program and it's
very

01:07:36.789 --> 01:07:36.799 align:start position:0%
very
 
01:07:38.789 --> 01:07:38.799 align:start position:0%
challenging at times to sort of
 
01:07:40.630 --> 01:07:40.640 align:start position:0%
coordinate both
 
01:07:43.589 --> 01:07:43.599 align:start position:0%
both sides
 
01:07:46.150 --> 01:07:46.160 align:start position:0%
the other thing and
 
01:07:46.160 --> 01:07:47.190 align:start position:0%
the other thing and
i

01:07:47.190 --> 01:07:47.200 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:07:49.109 --> 01:07:49.119 align:start position:0%
have to say i haven't i mean that's why
 
01:07:51.190 --> 01:07:51.200 align:start position:0%
we need a study committee i haven't
 
01:07:53.750 --> 01:07:53.760 align:start position:0%
delved deeply into this either
 
01:07:55.510 --> 01:07:55.520 align:start position:0%
is that
 
01:07:57.589 --> 01:07:57.599 align:start position:0%
the the state
 
01:08:02.230 --> 01:08:02.240 align:start position:0%
it does have a program whereby the um
 
01:08:05.190 --> 01:08:05.200 align:start position:0%
recyclables that we have are sold and
 
01:08:07.270 --> 01:08:07.280 align:start position:0%
that generates that goes into a
 
01:08:10.230 --> 01:08:10.240 align:start position:0%
recycling fund and that fund is supposed
 
01:08:11.510 --> 01:08:11.520 align:start position:0%
to support
 
01:08:11.520 --> 01:08:12.630 align:start position:0%
to support
further

01:08:12.630 --> 01:08:12.640 align:start position:0%
further
 
01:08:16.789 --> 01:08:16.799 align:start position:0%
solid waste diversion efforts
 
01:08:16.799 --> 01:08:17.749 align:start position:0%
solid waste diversion efforts
so

01:08:17.749 --> 01:08:17.759 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:08:21.269 --> 01:08:21.279 align:start position:0%
the hb 617 committee
 
01:08:24.630 --> 01:08:24.640 align:start position:0%
had a variety of recommendations as i
 
01:08:28.149 --> 01:08:28.159 align:start position:0%
noted but one of them was that das
 
01:08:29.910 --> 01:08:29.920 align:start position:0%
should work with the legislature to
 
01:08:32.630 --> 01:08:32.640 align:start position:0%
review and update state laws to reflect
 
01:08:35.430 --> 01:08:35.440 align:start position:0%
current solid ch solid waste challenges
 
01:08:37.749 --> 01:08:37.759 align:start position:0%
and opportunities and coordinate
 
01:08:40.630 --> 01:08:40.640 align:start position:0%
disposal and recycling efforts and it
 
01:08:43.910 --> 01:08:43.920 align:start position:0%
was and there's also a lba performance
 
01:08:48.470 --> 01:08:48.480 align:start position:0%
audit of das statewide recycling program
 
01:08:50.510 --> 01:08:50.520 align:start position:0%
and it's our
 
01:08:53.349 --> 01:08:53.359 align:start position:0%
understanding and if i'm incorrect they
 
01:08:56.229 --> 01:08:56.239 align:start position:0%
can they can correct me um that it's not
 
01:08:58.550 --> 01:08:58.560 align:start position:0%
been fully complied with yet so we
 
01:08:59.990 --> 01:09:00.000 align:start position:0%
thought maybe if we had a study
 
01:09:01.590 --> 01:09:01.600 align:start position:0%
committee we could look at that more
 
01:09:03.269 --> 01:09:03.279 align:start position:0%
deeply as well
 
01:09:03.279 --> 01:09:04.630 align:start position:0%
deeply as well
um

01:09:04.630 --> 01:09:04.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:09:08.709 --> 01:09:08.719 align:start position:0%
so i'm here uh as in my capacity as the
 
01:09:12.229 --> 01:09:12.239 align:start position:0%
former chair of the hb 617 study
 
01:09:13.829 --> 01:09:13.839 align:start position:0%
committee and following up on its
 
01:09:17.030 --> 01:09:17.040 align:start position:0%
recommendations in the introduction
 
01:09:19.669 --> 01:09:19.679 align:start position:0%
of this bill
 
01:09:21.269 --> 01:09:21.279 align:start position:0%
i'll just add
 
01:09:21.279 --> 01:09:22.149 align:start position:0%
i'll just add
that

01:09:22.149 --> 01:09:22.159 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:09:24.309 --> 01:09:24.319 align:start position:0%
i think that solid waste has been a
 
01:09:27.030 --> 01:09:27.040 align:start position:0%
pretty hot topic in the past year or so
 
01:09:31.430 --> 01:09:31.440 align:start position:0%
especially with the proposal by casella
 
01:09:35.829 --> 01:09:35.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:38.390 --> 01:09:38.400 align:start position:0%
and between that and the findings of our
 
01:09:40.229 --> 01:09:40.239 align:start position:0%
study committee
 
01:09:42.309 --> 01:09:42.319 align:start position:0%
several bills have been introduced and
 
01:09:45.590 --> 01:09:45.600 align:start position:0%
passed the house one was to
 
01:09:48.870 --> 01:09:48.880 align:start position:0%
change our solid waste diversion goals
 
01:09:51.829 --> 01:09:51.839 align:start position:0%
so that we now have a 25 cents 25
 
01:09:53.510 --> 01:09:53.520 align:start position:0%
percent reduction
 
01:09:57.430 --> 01:09:57.440 align:start position:0%
by 2030 goal and 45 percent reduction
 
01:10:01.669 --> 01:10:01.679 align:start position:0%
goal by 2050 and i feel we all have a
 
01:10:04.709 --> 01:10:04.719 align:start position:0%
great uh responsibility to do right by
 
01:10:07.430 --> 01:10:07.440 align:start position:0%
our state and the executive branch
 
01:10:09.750 --> 01:10:09.760 align:start position:0%
certainly is a generator of quite a bit
 
01:10:11.189 --> 01:10:11.199 align:start position:0%
of um
 
01:10:14.149 --> 01:10:14.159 align:start position:0%
trash and i think it's worth looking a
 
01:10:16.870 --> 01:10:16.880 align:start position:0%
little bit more closely at at how it's
 
01:10:20.390 --> 01:10:20.400 align:start position:0%
managed and i think it's a good
 
01:10:23.669 --> 01:10:23.679 align:start position:0%
role for a legislative study committee
 
01:10:27.350 --> 01:10:27.360 align:start position:0%
so on that basis um
 
01:10:29.430 --> 01:10:29.440 align:start position:0%
i'd like to recommend passage of this
 
01:10:31.910 --> 01:10:31.920 align:start position:0%
bill and i'd be more than happy to take
 
01:10:34.390 --> 01:10:34.400 align:start position:0%
your questions
 
01:10:35.750 --> 01:10:35.760 align:start position:0%
thank you i see we do have some
 
01:10:38.149 --> 01:10:38.159 align:start position:0%
questions representative o'brien
 
01:10:40.630 --> 01:10:40.640 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
01:10:43.350 --> 01:10:43.360 align:start position:0%
thank you representative ebel for uh
 
01:10:45.830 --> 01:10:45.840 align:start position:0%
and others for bringing this forward uh
 
01:10:47.350 --> 01:10:47.360 align:start position:0%
as you may
 
01:10:49.430 --> 01:10:49.440 align:start position:0%
know that i we're another hat and that's
 
01:10:51.270 --> 01:10:51.280 align:start position:0%
vice president of the board of aldermen
 
01:10:55.110 --> 01:10:55.120 align:start position:0%
in nashua and uh i'm on the board of uh
 
01:10:56.870 --> 01:10:56.880 align:start position:0%
public works committee and we've done a
 
01:10:58.310 --> 01:10:58.320 align:start position:0%
lot of work and this is one of the
 
01:10:59.990 --> 01:11:00.000 align:start position:0%
questions that really is hitting us in
 
01:11:01.189 --> 01:11:01.199 align:start position:0%
the forefront
 
01:11:04.550 --> 01:11:04.560 align:start position:0%
in the example in the city of nashua um
 
01:11:07.590 --> 01:11:07.600 align:start position:0%
we basically take what you know two bins
 
01:11:09.750 --> 01:11:09.760 align:start position:0%
not single stream two bins
 
01:11:12.310 --> 01:11:12.320 align:start position:0%
and that goes to the landfill only to be
 
01:11:13.990 --> 01:11:14.000 align:start position:0%
carted off to somewhere else where we
 
01:11:17.669 --> 01:11:17.679 align:start position:0%
can get a uh a tier weight of lower than
 
01:11:19.669 --> 01:11:19.679 align:start position:0%
to put it into our landfill because our
 
01:11:22.149 --> 01:11:22.159 align:start position:0%
landfill is coming to the end so we're
 
01:11:24.870 --> 01:11:24.880 align:start position:0%
very guarded with this so i understand
 
01:11:27.830 --> 01:11:27.840 align:start position:0%
the economics to it it's china that was
 
01:11:29.669 --> 01:11:29.679 align:start position:0%
one of the things that was brought up
 
01:11:31.830 --> 01:11:31.840 align:start position:0%
will this committee look into the
 
01:11:35.430 --> 01:11:35.440 align:start position:0%
economics and try to ingrain some
 
01:11:38.310 --> 01:11:38.320 align:start position:0%
homegrown use for these type of
 
01:11:41.189 --> 01:11:41.199 align:start position:0%
recyclables so that
 
01:11:43.350 --> 01:11:43.360 align:start position:0%
they have somewhere to go within this i
 
01:11:44.709 --> 01:11:44.719 align:start position:0%
mean this could be a drivable
 
01:11:46.310 --> 01:11:46.320 align:start position:0%
opportunity that
 
01:11:49.270 --> 01:11:49.280 align:start position:0%
we're just peeling back the covers on
 
01:11:51.590 --> 01:11:51.600 align:start position:0%
well thank you for your question
 
01:11:53.750 --> 01:11:53.760 align:start position:0%
representative o'brien i have to say
 
01:11:56.070 --> 01:11:56.080 align:start position:0%
that when we first started to dive into
 
01:11:58.070 --> 01:11:58.080 align:start position:0%
this subject in the committee that i
 
01:12:00.630 --> 01:12:00.640 align:start position:0%
chaired two years ago
 
01:12:03.750 --> 01:12:03.760 align:start position:0%
it was an astonishing journey because
 
01:12:05.830 --> 01:12:05.840 align:start position:0%
really this is an issue that touches
 
01:12:07.910 --> 01:12:07.920 align:start position:0%
every single person in every single
 
01:12:11.750 --> 01:12:11.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:11.760 --> 01:12:12.870 align:start position:0%
 
i

01:12:12.870 --> 01:12:12.880 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:12:15.590 --> 01:12:15.600 align:start position:0%
one of the another recommendation of the
 
01:12:18.709 --> 01:12:18.719 align:start position:0%
study committee was that we form a solid
 
01:12:20.550 --> 01:12:20.560 align:start position:0%
waste working group
 
01:12:20.560 --> 01:12:21.430 align:start position:0%
waste working group
and

01:12:21.430 --> 01:12:21.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:12:24.550 --> 01:12:24.560 align:start position:0%
that bill also passed the
 
01:12:27.189 --> 01:12:27.199 align:start position:0%
past the house it has now the working
 
01:12:29.350 --> 01:12:29.360 align:start position:0%
group has now been convened and i also
 
01:12:30.950 --> 01:12:30.960 align:start position:0%
chair that committee
 
01:12:33.669 --> 01:12:33.679 align:start position:0%
and the topics that you're talking about
 
01:12:36.310 --> 01:12:36.320 align:start position:0%
as far as economics
 
01:12:38.950 --> 01:12:38.960 align:start position:0%
how to promote markets
 
01:12:41.110 --> 01:12:41.120 align:start position:0%
just to really look at the solid waste
 
01:12:44.149 --> 01:12:44.159 align:start position:0%
situation in new hampshire and also to
 
01:12:45.830 --> 01:12:45.840 align:start position:0%
work with
 
01:12:48.390 --> 01:12:48.400 align:start position:0%
des in the production of a long-range
 
01:12:51.270 --> 01:12:51.280 align:start position:0%
solid waste plan which has not been done
 
01:12:54.870 --> 01:12:54.880 align:start position:0%
since 2003 that's all topics that are
 
01:12:56.790 --> 01:12:56.800 align:start position:0%
going to be covered by the solid waste
 
01:12:58.229 --> 01:12:58.239 align:start position:0%
working group
 
01:13:00.470 --> 01:13:00.480 align:start position:0%
i would say this
 
01:13:04.310 --> 01:13:04.320 align:start position:0%
study committee will be more focused on
 
01:13:06.630 --> 01:13:06.640 align:start position:0%
what the state itself does with its
 
01:13:09.510 --> 01:13:09.520 align:start position:0%
waste meaning the state agencies that'll
 
01:13:13.350 --> 01:13:13.360 align:start position:0%
necessarily get into economics i think
 
01:13:15.750 --> 01:13:15.760 align:start position:0%
especially because
 
01:13:18.709 --> 01:13:18.719 align:start position:0%
if you feel that the state in general
 
01:13:21.270 --> 01:13:21.280 align:start position:0%
has a solid waste problem
 
01:13:23.590 --> 01:13:23.600 align:start position:0%
the state itself should
 
01:13:26.550 --> 01:13:26.560 align:start position:0%
ostensibly be a leader in some of the
 
01:13:28.790 --> 01:13:28.800 align:start position:0%
concepts that it puts forward to deal
 
01:13:31.430 --> 01:13:31.440 align:start position:0%
with that problem
 
01:13:31.440 --> 01:13:32.550 align:start position:0%
with that problem
and

01:13:32.550 --> 01:13:32.560 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:13:34.310 --> 01:13:34.320 align:start position:0%
you know one of the things i think we'll
 
01:13:36.550 --> 01:13:36.560 align:start position:0%
be looking at is just the various uh
 
01:13:36.560 --> 01:13:37.990 align:start position:0%
be looking at is just the various uh
procurement

01:13:37.990 --> 01:13:38.000 align:start position:0%
procurement
 
01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:38.790 align:start position:0%
procurement
uh

01:13:38.790 --> 01:13:38.800 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:13:38.800 --> 01:13:40.229 align:start position:0%
uh
um

01:13:40.229 --> 01:13:40.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:13:42.550 --> 01:13:42.560 align:start position:0%
requirements because one of the problems
 
01:13:45.110 --> 01:13:45.120 align:start position:0%
with recyclables is that you have to
 
01:13:48.470 --> 01:13:48.480 align:start position:0%
have a market for them and so um you
 
01:13:50.709 --> 01:13:50.719 align:start position:0%
know just talking about toilet paper or
 
01:13:52.550 --> 01:13:52.560 align:start position:0%
whatever you want to talk about if you
 
01:13:55.990 --> 01:13:56.000 align:start position:0%
buy toilet paper or paper that's 50
 
01:13:59.510 --> 01:13:59.520 align:start position:0%
recyclable your you do help to promote a
 
01:14:01.830 --> 01:14:01.840 align:start position:0%
recyclable market so i don't know if
 
01:14:03.750 --> 01:14:03.760 align:start position:0%
that completely answers your question
 
01:14:05.669 --> 01:14:05.679 align:start position:0%
but i want to assure you that even
 
01:14:08.149 --> 01:14:08.159 align:start position:0%
though like the situation in nash or
 
01:14:10.870 --> 01:14:10.880 align:start position:0%
whatever wouldn't be quite the focus
 
01:14:13.270 --> 01:14:13.280 align:start position:0%
it's definitely being analyzed as part
 
01:14:16.070 --> 01:14:16.080 align:start position:0%
of the solid waste working group
 
01:14:17.750 --> 01:14:17.760 align:start position:0%
it does thank you representative thank
 
01:14:20.229 --> 01:14:20.239 align:start position:0%
you madam chair representative lekkis
 
01:14:22.709 --> 01:14:22.719 align:start position:0%
thank you um yeah my concerns are are
 
01:14:24.870 --> 01:14:24.880 align:start position:0%
similar to uh representative o'brien's
 
01:14:26.149 --> 01:14:26.159 align:start position:0%
and that
 
01:14:29.030 --> 01:14:29.040 align:start position:0%
i think the key is finding a way to
 
01:14:31.350 --> 01:14:31.360 align:start position:0%
safely get rid of uh
 
01:14:34.229 --> 01:14:34.239 align:start position:0%
trash at as low a cost as possible both
 
01:14:35.990 --> 01:14:36.000 align:start position:0%
for the state and you know all the
 
01:14:37.750 --> 01:14:37.760 align:start position:0%
municipalities and
 
01:14:39.910 --> 01:14:39.920 align:start position:0%
so i was uh wondering if there's a
 
01:14:41.910 --> 01:14:41.920 align:start position:0%
particular reason and i feel that's true
 
01:14:44.149 --> 01:14:44.159 align:start position:0%
whether it's recycling not recycling
 
01:14:47.110 --> 01:14:47.120 align:start position:0%
whatever the method is the key is what
 
01:14:49.110 --> 01:14:49.120 align:start position:0%
is it costing and i was just wondering
 
01:14:51.110 --> 01:14:51.120 align:start position:0%
why looking at that's not explicitly
 
01:14:52.870 --> 01:14:52.880 align:start position:0%
included in the duties
 
01:14:55.430 --> 01:14:55.440 align:start position:0%
of this proposed commission
 
01:14:55.440 --> 01:14:56.630 align:start position:0%
of this proposed commission
um

01:14:56.630 --> 01:14:56.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:14:58.630 --> 01:14:58.640 align:start position:0%
i mean i think if you review the
 
01:15:02.070 --> 01:15:02.080 align:start position:0%
policies the economics will definitely
 
01:15:04.229 --> 01:15:04.239 align:start position:0%
come into it it's just
 
01:15:05.350 --> 01:15:05.360 align:start position:0%
i mean
 
01:15:07.910 --> 01:15:07.920 align:start position:0%
i have to say when we did the 617
 
01:15:11.430 --> 01:15:11.440 align:start position:0%
committee one of the i mean if not the
 
01:15:13.669 --> 01:15:13.679 align:start position:0%
main reason that i introduced it was
 
01:15:16.790 --> 01:15:16.800 align:start position:0%
that the poor municipalities were really
 
01:15:18.950 --> 01:15:18.960 align:start position:0%
getting hit very hard with an increase
 
01:15:20.630 --> 01:15:20.640 align:start position:0%
in tipping fees
 
01:15:22.149 --> 01:15:22.159 align:start position:0%
so um
 
01:15:24.070 --> 01:15:24.080 align:start position:0%
you know i think the idea is to to
 
01:15:27.110 --> 01:15:27.120 align:start position:0%
review some of this solid waste as a as
 
01:15:29.590 --> 01:15:29.600 align:start position:0%
a commodity in a way
 
01:15:32.630 --> 01:15:32.640 align:start position:0%
separate the parts out and sell them
 
01:15:34.870 --> 01:15:34.880 align:start position:0%
for reuse and then you can bring more
 
01:15:36.870 --> 01:15:36.880 align:start position:0%
money in i mean that's that's really
 
01:15:39.270 --> 01:15:39.280 align:start position:0%
what it's all about and
 
01:15:41.590 --> 01:15:41.600 align:start position:0%
you know if we can work with the state
 
01:15:44.070 --> 01:15:44.080 align:start position:0%
itself to save money and sort of
 
01:15:46.310 --> 01:15:46.320 align:start position:0%
coordinate the practices
 
01:15:48.630 --> 01:15:48.640 align:start position:0%
um that i mentioned earlier
 
01:15:51.510 --> 01:15:51.520 align:start position:0%
all in all i mean in the end it's
 
01:15:53.430 --> 01:15:53.440 align:start position:0%
it's better for the environment but it
 
01:15:56.950 --> 01:15:56.960 align:start position:0%
also should save all of us money and um
 
01:15:59.030 --> 01:15:59.040 align:start position:0%
i just have to add here when we're
 
01:16:01.910 --> 01:16:01.920 align:start position:0%
talking about money
 
01:16:03.990 --> 01:16:04.000 align:start position:0%
and the state
 
01:16:06.390 --> 01:16:06.400 align:start position:0%
our neighboring states are
 
01:16:08.470 --> 01:16:08.480 align:start position:0%
really focusing
 
01:16:11.030 --> 01:16:11.040 align:start position:0%
very strongly on the issue of solid
 
01:16:12.870 --> 01:16:12.880 align:start position:0%
waste they're they're putting a lot of
 
01:16:15.910 --> 01:16:15.920 align:start position:0%
practices into place to avoid
 
01:16:18.470 --> 01:16:18.480 align:start position:0%
landfilling and in fact they're starting
 
01:16:21.110 --> 01:16:21.120 align:start position:0%
to shut down their landfills and that
 
01:16:23.430 --> 01:16:23.440 align:start position:0%
really directly affects the state of new
 
01:16:26.229 --> 01:16:26.239 align:start position:0%
hampshire because our tipping fees are
 
01:16:28.790 --> 01:16:28.800 align:start position:0%
less than massachusetts massachusetts i
 
01:16:32.709 --> 01:16:32.719 align:start position:0%
think on average is 122
 
01:16:37.030 --> 01:16:37.040 align:start position:0%
dollars per ton we average 80.
 
01:16:39.270 --> 01:16:39.280 align:start position:0%
and when towns in massachusetts are
 
01:16:41.270 --> 01:16:41.280 align:start position:0%
looking to save some money
 
01:16:43.189 --> 01:16:43.199 align:start position:0%
they can look right across the border
 
01:16:45.030 --> 01:16:45.040 align:start position:0%
and come to our
 
01:16:47.990 --> 01:16:48.000 align:start position:0%
come to our landfills so we just have a
 
01:16:50.630 --> 01:16:50.640 align:start position:0%
whole lot of things to look at and i was
 
01:16:52.790 --> 01:16:52.800 align:start position:0%
just really concerned and our study
 
01:16:54.550 --> 01:16:54.560 align:start position:0%
committee was concerned that we actually
 
01:16:56.550 --> 01:16:56.560 align:start position:0%
hadn't looked at the executive branch
 
01:16:56.560 --> 01:16:58.550 align:start position:0%
hadn't looked at the executive branch
practices

01:16:58.550 --> 01:16:58.560 align:start position:0%
practices
 
01:16:59.590 --> 01:16:59.600 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:17:03.030 --> 01:17:03.040 align:start position:0%
representative schmidt
 
01:17:04.709 --> 01:17:04.719 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
01:17:06.149 --> 01:17:06.159 align:start position:0%
so representative
 
01:17:06.159 --> 01:17:07.270 align:start position:0%
so representative
uh

01:17:07.270 --> 01:17:07.280 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:17:10.070 --> 01:17:10.080 align:start position:0%
dover has a recycling
 
01:17:12.149 --> 01:17:12.159 align:start position:0%
program of sorts
 
01:17:14.149 --> 01:17:14.159 align:start position:0%
and so does portsmouth and i imagine
 
01:17:16.709 --> 01:17:16.719 align:start position:0%
that virtually every other city does
 
01:17:19.510 --> 01:17:19.520 align:start position:0%
so the question i have is i i wonder
 
01:17:21.510 --> 01:17:21.520 align:start position:0%
whether you think that the public
 
01:17:24.310 --> 01:17:24.320 align:start position:0%
especially in the cities has any idea of
 
01:17:26.630 --> 01:17:26.640 align:start position:0%
the the reality that an awful lot of
 
01:17:28.470 --> 01:17:28.480 align:start position:0%
this stuff is not getting recycled at
 
01:17:30.950 --> 01:17:30.960 align:start position:0%
all it's going right in the landfills
 
01:17:32.470 --> 01:17:32.480 align:start position:0%
representative schmidt that's a very
 
01:17:34.070 --> 01:17:34.080 align:start position:0%
interesting question but it's not
 
01:17:37.110 --> 01:17:37.120 align:start position:0%
relevant to state agencies well but the
 
01:17:39.110 --> 01:17:39.120 align:start position:0%
point is that that
 
01:17:41.030 --> 01:17:41.040 align:start position:0%
i'm very supportive of the bill because
 
01:17:43.510 --> 01:17:43.520 align:start position:0%
i think that we're kidding ourselves if
 
01:17:46.149 --> 01:17:46.159 align:start position:0%
we think that it's it's not going to get
 
01:17:47.669 --> 01:17:47.679 align:start position:0%
dramatically worse
 
01:17:49.830 --> 01:17:49.840 align:start position:0%
very quickly if we don't do something so
 
01:17:52.950 --> 01:17:52.960 align:start position:0%
but i'm i i do wonder whether whether
 
01:17:55.189 --> 01:17:55.199 align:start position:0%
the public i think there is a relevancy
 
01:17:56.470 --> 01:17:56.480 align:start position:0%
madam share
 
01:17:58.070 --> 01:17:58.080 align:start position:0%
because i think if if the public
 
01:17:59.830 --> 01:17:59.840 align:start position:0%
understood it they would they would get
 
01:18:01.990 --> 01:18:02.000 align:start position:0%
be get up in arms about the idea that
 
01:18:03.750 --> 01:18:03.760 align:start position:0%
the effort that they're going to
 
01:18:06.550 --> 01:18:06.560 align:start position:0%
and the the value that is inherent in
 
01:18:09.270 --> 01:18:09.280 align:start position:0%
this stuff um is
 
01:18:11.189 --> 01:18:11.199 align:start position:0%
is being trashed so
 
01:18:12.630 --> 01:18:12.640 align:start position:0%
i think there is a connection with i'll
 
01:18:14.630 --> 01:18:14.640 align:start position:0%
do respect madam chair
 
01:18:16.310 --> 01:18:16.320 align:start position:0%
but i i'm supportive of the bill of
 
01:18:17.830 --> 01:18:17.840 align:start position:0%
course thank you for connecting it
 
01:18:19.830 --> 01:18:19.840 align:start position:0%
representative schmidt are there any
 
01:18:21.430 --> 01:18:21.440 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
01:18:23.350 --> 01:18:23.360 align:start position:0%
yes representative pearson thank you
 
01:18:25.750 --> 01:18:25.760 align:start position:0%
madam chair thank you representative for
 
01:18:28.149 --> 01:18:28.159 align:start position:0%
for coming here um
 
01:18:31.669 --> 01:18:31.679 align:start position:0%
i uh i personally find landfills
 
01:18:33.590 --> 01:18:33.600 align:start position:0%
abhorrent that's how we dump trash 100
 
01:18:35.350 --> 01:18:35.360 align:start position:0%
years ago and
 
01:18:36.950 --> 01:18:36.960 align:start position:0%
we should we shouldn't be having them at
 
01:18:39.350 --> 01:18:39.360 align:start position:0%
all period my town the folks i represent
 
01:18:40.470 --> 01:18:40.480 align:start position:0%
in derry
 
01:18:42.950 --> 01:18:42.960 align:start position:0%
our landfill is tapped out we truck
 
01:18:44.870 --> 01:18:44.880 align:start position:0%
everything out
 
01:18:47.990 --> 01:18:48.000 align:start position:0%
but we have a
 
01:18:49.430 --> 01:18:49.440 align:start position:0%
facility that was built for several
 
01:18:51.910 --> 01:18:51.920 align:start position:0%
million dollars to separate our
 
01:18:54.470 --> 01:18:54.480 align:start position:0%
recycling in the public works director
 
01:18:57.189 --> 01:18:57.199 align:start position:0%
tells us that a lot of it because the
 
01:18:57.199 --> 01:18:58.310 align:start position:0%
tells us that a lot of it because the
cost

01:18:58.310 --> 01:18:58.320 align:start position:0%
cost
 
01:19:00.470 --> 01:19:00.480 align:start position:0%
benefit isn't there
 
01:19:01.990 --> 01:19:02.000 align:start position:0%
they end up it just ends up getting
 
01:19:03.669 --> 01:19:03.679 align:start position:0%
dumped we don't even recycle glass and
 
01:19:05.430 --> 01:19:05.440 align:start position:0%
dairy because it's too expensive it gets
 
01:19:07.669 --> 01:19:07.679 align:start position:0%
ground up and mixed into asphalt
 
01:19:07.679 --> 01:19:09.189 align:start position:0%
ground up and mixed into asphalt
so

01:19:09.189 --> 01:19:09.199 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:19:11.350 --> 01:19:11.360 align:start position:0%
looking at this from us from what you're
 
01:19:13.430 --> 01:19:13.440 align:start position:0%
proposing at the state level in your
 
01:19:15.189 --> 01:19:15.199 align:start position:0%
testimony you brought
 
01:19:17.590 --> 01:19:17.600 align:start position:0%
that you passed passed out you provided
 
01:19:20.070 --> 01:19:20.080 align:start position:0%
a state policy
 
01:19:21.990 --> 01:19:22.000 align:start position:0%
right that already exists in reference
 
01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:23.430 align:start position:0%
right that already exists in reference
to

01:19:23.430 --> 01:19:23.440 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:19:23.440 --> 01:19:24.790 align:start position:0%
to
um

01:19:24.790 --> 01:19:24.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:19:24.800 --> 01:19:25.830 align:start position:0%
um
yes

01:19:25.830 --> 01:19:25.840 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:19:27.590 --> 01:19:27.600 align:start position:0%
you know the what the what the state
 
01:19:29.910 --> 01:19:29.920 align:start position:0%
should be doing so there's a seems as
 
01:19:31.590 --> 01:19:31.600 align:start position:0%
though we have a policy
 
01:19:34.709 --> 01:19:34.719 align:start position:0%
um and on top of that there has been a
 
01:19:34.719 --> 01:19:36.790 align:start position:0%
um and on top of that there has been a
recent

01:19:36.790 --> 01:19:36.800 align:start position:0%
recent
 
01:19:39.750 --> 01:19:39.760 align:start position:0%
committee that you've referred to
 
01:19:41.550 --> 01:19:41.560 align:start position:0%
our our
 
01:19:44.630 --> 01:19:44.640 align:start position:0%
hb617 study committee correct okay that
 
01:19:48.790 --> 01:19:48.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:51.030 --> 01:19:51.040 align:start position:0%
yeah actually the
 
01:19:52.310 --> 01:19:52.320 align:start position:0%
the my
 
01:19:54.390 --> 01:19:54.400 align:start position:0%
my point is is that with having a state
 
01:19:56.470 --> 01:19:56.480 align:start position:0%
policy in in
 
01:19:58.310 --> 01:19:58.320 align:start position:0%
that seems to be in place and having a
 
01:19:58.320 --> 01:19:59.430 align:start position:0%
that seems to be in place and having a
recent

01:19:59.430 --> 01:19:59.440 align:start position:0%
recent
 
01:20:02.630 --> 01:20:02.640 align:start position:0%
committee already functioning
 
01:20:04.630 --> 01:20:04.640 align:start position:0%
is it a little too soon to be convening
 
01:20:06.709 --> 01:20:06.719 align:start position:0%
another one or you know we have 200
 
01:20:08.550 --> 01:20:08.560 align:start position:0%
committees in the right now
 
01:20:10.070 --> 01:20:10.080 align:start position:0%
is there an existing committee that this
 
01:20:11.350 --> 01:20:11.360 align:start position:0%
can be
 
01:20:13.669 --> 01:20:13.679 align:start position:0%
can be this mission can be brought to
 
01:20:16.790 --> 01:20:16.800 align:start position:0%
rather than forming a 201st
 
01:20:18.950 --> 01:20:18.960 align:start position:0%
committee that's a that's a very good
 
01:20:22.470 --> 01:20:22.480 align:start position:0%
question um i chaired for two years a
 
01:20:24.550 --> 01:20:24.560 align:start position:0%
committee on committees looking over all
 
01:20:26.870 --> 01:20:26.880 align:start position:0%
these committees and recommending uh
 
01:20:26.880 --> 01:20:27.990 align:start position:0%
these committees and recommending uh
repeal

01:20:27.990 --> 01:20:28.000 align:start position:0%
repeal
 
01:20:30.310 --> 01:20:30.320 align:start position:0%
but you know the primary
 
01:20:32.470 --> 01:20:32.480 align:start position:0%
problem that we focused on is the
 
01:20:34.390 --> 01:20:34.400 align:start position:0%
creation of committees that have an
 
01:20:35.990 --> 01:20:36.000 align:start position:0%
unlimited life
 
01:20:38.149 --> 01:20:38.159 align:start position:0%
term so i'm glad you asked the question
 
01:20:39.990 --> 01:20:40.000 align:start position:0%
actually because i was going to
 
01:20:42.149 --> 01:20:42.159 align:start position:0%
get into this because of this other hat
 
01:20:44.629 --> 01:20:44.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:47.430 --> 01:20:47.440 align:start position:0%
you know stud study committees um
 
01:20:49.189 --> 01:20:49.199 align:start position:0%
legislative study committees they're
 
01:20:52.550 --> 01:20:52.560 align:start position:0%
five people they're very short-term
 
01:20:54.550 --> 01:20:54.560 align:start position:0%
and if you have people that are really
 
01:20:56.790 --> 01:20:56.800 align:start position:0%
dedicated uh
 
01:20:59.350 --> 01:20:59.360 align:start position:0%
to delving into a particular topic they
 
01:21:02.149 --> 01:21:02.159 align:start position:0%
could really do great things
 
01:21:04.550 --> 01:21:04.560 align:start position:0%
the recycling study committee that i did
 
01:21:08.070 --> 01:21:08.080 align:start position:0%
we really we got very deep very fast we
 
01:21:11.030 --> 01:21:11.040 align:start position:0%
had over 50 stakeholders but
 
01:21:12.390 --> 01:21:12.400 align:start position:0%
as i mentioned
 
01:21:14.310 --> 01:21:14.320 align:start position:0%
one of the things that we just really
 
01:21:17.430 --> 01:21:17.440 align:start position:0%
didn't have time to get into adequately
 
01:21:19.510 --> 01:21:19.520 align:start position:0%
was what the state does with its own
 
01:21:19.520 --> 01:21:21.110 align:start position:0%
was what the state does with its own
waste

01:21:21.110 --> 01:21:21.120 align:start position:0%
waste
 
01:21:23.990 --> 01:21:24.000 align:start position:0%
we do have statutes in place it sounds
 
01:21:25.590 --> 01:21:25.600 align:start position:0%
to me from the
 
01:21:27.030 --> 01:21:27.040 align:start position:0%
from the
 
01:21:29.510 --> 01:21:29.520 align:start position:0%
performance audit that it's been
 
01:21:31.830 --> 01:21:31.840 align:start position:0%
difficult for the agency to really do as
 
01:21:34.550 --> 01:21:34.560 align:start position:0%
much as it should be able to do
 
01:21:36.709 --> 01:21:36.719 align:start position:0%
using those statutes the other thing i
 
01:21:38.790 --> 01:21:38.800 align:start position:0%
would say is that the statutes haven't
 
01:21:42.550 --> 01:21:42.560 align:start position:0%
really been reviewed since their um
 
01:21:45.430 --> 01:21:45.440 align:start position:0%
introduction which if i read the
 
01:21:48.709 --> 01:21:48.719 align:start position:0%
the the the uh notes correctly it's
 
01:21:50.629 --> 01:21:50.639 align:start position:0%
probably 2008.
 
01:21:50.639 --> 01:21:51.590 align:start position:0%
probably 2008.
um

01:21:51.590 --> 01:21:51.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:21:55.030 --> 01:21:55.040 align:start position:0%
and again in our region a lot of states
 
01:21:58.229 --> 01:21:58.239 align:start position:0%
are analyzing their own executive branch
 
01:22:01.350 --> 01:22:01.360 align:start position:0%
practices to see if they can't do better
 
01:22:03.990 --> 01:22:04.000 align:start position:0%
i mean we are we do now have a diversion
 
01:22:06.149 --> 01:22:06.159 align:start position:0%
goal and i agree with you landfilling is
 
01:22:08.550 --> 01:22:08.560 align:start position:0%
pretty abhorrent
 
01:22:12.870 --> 01:22:12.880 align:start position:0%
i would argue that our state should help
 
01:22:15.910 --> 01:22:15.920 align:start position:0%
our state agencies should
 
01:22:17.830 --> 01:22:17.840 align:start position:0%
put together practices that help to
 
01:22:20.950 --> 01:22:20.960 align:start position:0%
achieve those goals so i do think
 
01:22:23.189 --> 01:22:23.199 align:start position:0%
that this committee
 
01:22:24.550 --> 01:22:24.560 align:start position:0%
would be
 
01:22:26.870 --> 01:22:26.880 align:start position:0%
worthwhile i can tell you that the solid
 
01:22:28.790 --> 01:22:28.800 align:start position:0%
waste working group that i'm chairing
 
01:22:31.669 --> 01:22:31.679 align:start position:0%
now there's about 20 people
 
01:22:33.430 --> 01:22:33.440 align:start position:0%
i don't really think that we're going to
 
01:22:39.910 --> 01:22:39.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:41.030 --> 01:22:41.040 align:start position:0%
are there other questions from the
 
01:22:41.040 --> 01:22:43.590 align:start position:0%
are there other questions from the
committee

01:22:43.590 --> 01:22:43.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:44.870 --> 01:22:44.880 align:start position:0%
okay seeing none thank you

is there anyone else who wishes to
 
01:22:57.910 --> 01:22:57.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:59.669 --> 01:22:59.679 align:start position:0%

01:32:08.070 --> 01:32:08.080 align:start position:0%
this bill exempts certain niche beauty
 
01:32:11.030 --> 01:32:11.040 align:start position:0%
services from occupational and shop

licensure requirements
 
01:32:16.229 --> 01:32:16.239 align:start position:0%
niche beauty services are specialized
 
01:32:19.270 --> 01:32:19.280 align:start position:0%
services that are limited in scope are
 
01:32:22.550 --> 01:32:22.560 align:start position:0%
inherently safe and do not use involve
 
01:32:24.629 --> 01:32:24.639 align:start position:0%
the use of potentially dangerous

chemicals or tools
 
01:32:29.110 --> 01:32:29.120 align:start position:0%
they are primarily learned outside of

cosmetology schools and are commonly
 
01:32:34.470 --> 01:32:34.480 align:start position:0%
practiced by regular people
 
01:32:36.950 --> 01:32:36.960 align:start position:0%
every day in their homes
 
01:32:39.350 --> 01:32:39.360 align:start position:0%
niche beauty services covered in this
 
01:32:41.189 --> 01:32:41.199 align:start position:0%
bill include
 
01:32:43.350 --> 01:32:43.360 align:start position:0%

makeup application and threading
 
01:32:52.149 --> 01:32:52.159 align:start position:0%
the problem that this bill addresses is
 
01:32:54.950 --> 01:32:54.960 align:start position:0%
that under current new hampshire law
 
01:32:57.510 --> 01:32:57.520 align:start position:0%
individuals who desire to provide niche
 
01:33:00.229 --> 01:33:00.239 align:start position:0%
beauty services to clients
 
01:33:02.709 --> 01:33:02.719 align:start position:0%
must spend thousands of dollars to
 
01:33:04.950 --> 01:33:04.960 align:start position:0%
attend cosmetology school
 
01:33:07.430 --> 01:33:07.440 align:start position:0%
the average cosmetology program in new
 
01:33:07.440 --> 01:33:08.390 align:start position:0%
the average cosmetology program in new
hampshire

01:33:08.390 --> 01:33:08.400 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
01:33:11.430 --> 01:33:11.440 align:start position:0%
cost over 19 thousand dollars
 
01:33:13.590 --> 01:33:13.600 align:start position:0%
they must also earn hundreds of
 
01:33:15.990 --> 01:33:16.000 align:start position:0%
educational credit hours in new
 
01:33:19.750 --> 01:33:19.760 align:start position:0%
hampshire 1500 educational hours are
 
01:33:23.510 --> 01:33:23.520 align:start position:0%
required for cosmetology licensure
 
01:33:23.520 --> 01:33:24.310 align:start position:0%
required for cosmetology licensure
for

01:33:24.310 --> 01:33:24.320 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:33:27.830 --> 01:33:27.840 align:start position:0%
comparison an emt licensure requires a
 
01:33:32.550 --> 01:33:32.560 align:start position:0%
minimum minimum of 150 educational hours
 
01:33:34.870 --> 01:33:34.880 align:start position:0%
which is one-tenth of the cosmetology
 
01:33:34.880 --> 01:33:36.790 align:start position:0%
which is one-tenth of the cosmetology
requirement

01:33:36.790 --> 01:33:36.800 align:start position:0%
requirement
 
01:33:40.950 --> 01:33:40.960 align:start position:0%
and these individuals must pay a 104
 
01:33:43.350 --> 01:33:43.360 align:start position:0%
dollar practical exam fee
 
01:33:46.709 --> 01:33:46.719 align:start position:0%
and an 88 dollar written exam fee
 
01:33:50.950 --> 01:33:50.960 align:start position:0%
and 30 dollars to obtain a new license
 
01:33:53.110 --> 01:33:53.120 align:start position:0%
all of these expenses often lead to
 
01:33:55.910 --> 01:33:55.920 align:start position:0%
financial debt in order to attend a
 
01:33:57.669 --> 01:33:57.679 align:start position:0%
program to learn
 
01:34:01.430 --> 01:34:01.440 align:start position:0%
many skills that a niche beauty provider
 
01:34:04.709 --> 01:34:04.719 align:start position:0%
will unlikely use in their practice
 
01:34:08.229 --> 01:34:08.239 align:start position:0%
clearly this is time consuming costly
 
01:34:10.550 --> 01:34:10.560 align:start position:0%
and unnecessary
 
01:34:13.189 --> 01:34:13.199 align:start position:0%
the solution that this bill provides is
 
01:34:13.199 --> 01:34:14.790 align:start position:0%
the solution that this bill provides is
straightforward

01:34:14.790 --> 01:34:14.800 align:start position:0%
straightforward
 
01:34:14.800 --> 01:34:16.070 align:start position:0%
straightforward
first

01:34:16.070 --> 01:34:16.080 align:start position:0%
first
 
01:34:19.110 --> 01:34:19.120 align:start position:0%
this bill defines the limited
 
01:34:21.990 --> 01:34:22.000 align:start position:0%
scope of practice for niche beauty
 
01:34:26.149 --> 01:34:26.159 align:start position:0%
services to include blow dry styling
 
01:34:28.790 --> 01:34:28.800 align:start position:0%
eyelash extension application
 
01:34:30.629 --> 01:34:30.639 align:start position:0%
makeup application
 
01:34:33.430 --> 01:34:33.440 align:start position:0%
and threading second
 
01:34:36.629 --> 01:34:36.639 align:start position:0%
this bill exempts these four specific
 
01:34:39.750 --> 01:34:39.760 align:start position:0%
niche beauty services from individual
 
01:34:42.629 --> 01:34:42.639 align:start position:0%
and facility license requirements
 
01:34:44.310 --> 01:34:44.320 align:start position:0%
and third
 
01:34:46.790 --> 01:34:46.800 align:start position:0%
this bill provides protections under the
 
01:34:49.510 --> 01:34:49.520 align:start position:0%
consumer protection act
 
01:34:52.310 --> 01:34:52.320 align:start position:0%
lastly i have an amendment to the bill
 
01:34:57.910 --> 01:34:57.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:01.030 --> 01:35:01.040 align:start position:0%
and and that is in the handouts that i
 
01:35:02.229 --> 01:35:02.239 align:start position:0%
gave to you
 
01:35:04.149 --> 01:35:04.159 align:start position:0%
the purpose of the amendment is to
 
01:35:07.430 --> 01:35:07.440 align:start position:0%
properly align the type of services
 
01:35:09.870 --> 01:35:09.880 align:start position:0%

01:35:17.910 --> 01:35:17.920 align:start position:0%
with the exemption of niche beauty
 
01:35:20.709 --> 01:35:20.719 align:start position:0%
services from occupational licensure the
 
01:35:24.669 --> 01:35:24.679 align:start position:0%
language in section 16 on page 2 lines
 
01:35:28.870 --> 01:35:28.880 align:start position:0%
31-32 is replaced by the amendment
 
01:35:31.270 --> 01:35:31.280 align:start position:0%
in conclusion
 
01:35:34.149 --> 01:35:34.159 align:start position:0%
this bill removes the red tape for
 
01:35:37.030 --> 01:35:37.040 align:start position:0%
individuals seeking to work in the niche
 
01:35:38.790 --> 01:35:38.800 align:start position:0%
beauty industry
 
01:35:41.350 --> 01:35:41.360 align:start position:0%
this bill creates
 
01:35:44.229 --> 01:35:44.239 align:start position:0%
job opportunities in new hampshire by
 
01:35:46.950 --> 01:35:46.960 align:start position:0%
exempting these niche beauty services
 
01:35:49.910 --> 01:35:49.920 align:start position:0%
from licensure requirements and
 
01:35:52.310 --> 01:35:52.320 align:start position:0%
this bill upholds
 
01:35:54.550 --> 01:35:54.560 align:start position:0%
the current laws for the practice of
 
01:35:57.669 --> 01:35:57.679 align:start position:0%
licensed barbering cosmetology and
 
01:36:00.070 --> 01:36:00.080 align:start position:0%
aesthetic professionals
 
01:36:02.310 --> 01:36:02.320 align:start position:0%
that concludes my bill introduction

asking my perennial question
 
01:36:29.360 --> 01:36:30.870 align:start position:0%
asking my perennial question
but

01:36:30.870 --> 01:36:30.880 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:36:32.709 --> 01:36:32.719 align:start position:0%
i'm wondering
 
01:36:34.870 --> 01:36:34.880 align:start position:0%
representative power
 
01:36:37.510 --> 01:36:37.520 align:start position:0%
whether the current
 
01:36:40.550 --> 01:36:40.560 align:start position:0%
cosmetology practitioners licensees and
 
01:36:43.350 --> 01:36:43.360 align:start position:0%
so forth do they already provide
 
01:36:45.669 --> 01:36:45.679 align:start position:0%
any or all of these services
 
01:36:46.709 --> 01:36:46.719 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
01:36:46.719 --> 01:36:48.149 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
representative

01:36:48.149 --> 01:36:48.159 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:36:51.430 --> 01:36:51.440 align:start position:0%
so that would depend on the
 
01:36:53.910 --> 01:36:53.920 align:start position:0%
services that a particular licensed
 
01:36:53.920 --> 01:36:55.430 align:start position:0%
services that a particular licensed
cosmetologist

01:36:55.430 --> 01:36:55.440 align:start position:0%
cosmetologist
 
01:36:57.350 --> 01:36:57.360 align:start position:0%
chooses to provide
 
01:36:59.590 --> 01:36:59.600 align:start position:0%
they're oftentimes licensed
 
01:36:59.600 --> 01:37:02.709 align:start position:0%
they're oftentimes licensed
cosmetologists

01:37:02.709 --> 01:37:02.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:05.350 --> 01:37:05.360 align:start position:0%
decide to specialize
 
01:37:07.189 --> 01:37:07.199 align:start position:0%
in a certain
 
01:37:09.750 --> 01:37:09.760 align:start position:0%
service for example hair extensions they
 
01:37:09.760 --> 01:37:10.550 align:start position:0%
service for example hair extensions they
they

01:37:10.550 --> 01:37:10.560 align:start position:0%
they
 
01:37:10.560 --> 01:37:11.830 align:start position:0%
they
typically

01:37:11.830 --> 01:37:11.840 align:start position:0%
typically
 
01:37:13.430 --> 01:37:13.440 align:start position:0%
you know will not
 
01:37:15.910 --> 01:37:15.920 align:start position:0%
just solely focus on that
 
01:37:19.590 --> 01:37:19.600 align:start position:0%
so additionally what i would say is
 
01:37:22.709 --> 01:37:22.719 align:start position:0%
that it again it all depends
 
01:37:24.709 --> 01:37:24.719 align:start position:0%
but to be clear
 
01:37:28.229 --> 01:37:28.239 align:start position:0%
topics such as threading
 
01:37:32.310 --> 01:37:32.320 align:start position:0%
in eyelash extensions it's not typically
 
01:37:35.590 --> 01:37:35.600 align:start position:0%
found in the required cosmetology
 
01:37:35.600 --> 01:37:36.870 align:start position:0%
found in the required cosmetology
curriculum

01:37:36.870 --> 01:37:36.880 align:start position:0%
curriculum
 
01:37:38.070 --> 01:37:38.080 align:start position:0%
if a
 
01:37:40.149 --> 01:37:40.159 align:start position:0%
individual would like to
 
01:37:43.830 --> 01:37:43.840 align:start position:0%
provide those services to clients they
 
01:37:43.840 --> 01:37:45.350 align:start position:0%
provide those services to clients they
must

01:37:45.350 --> 01:37:45.360 align:start position:0%
must
 
01:37:46.629 --> 01:37:46.639 align:start position:0%
not must
 
01:37:49.830 --> 01:37:49.840 align:start position:0%
they they will learn those skills
 
01:37:51.430 --> 01:37:51.440 align:start position:0%
outside of the
 
01:37:51.440 --> 01:37:53.030 align:start position:0%
outside of the
curriculum

01:37:53.030 --> 01:37:53.040 align:start position:0%
curriculum
 
01:37:55.590 --> 01:37:55.600 align:start position:0%
that they that they
 
01:37:59.590 --> 01:37:59.600 align:start position:0%
take in cosmetology school it's an extra
 
01:38:03.109 --> 01:38:03.119 align:start position:0%
step one follow-up madame pure so i i
 
01:38:05.350 --> 01:38:05.360 align:start position:0%
kind of know what some of these services
 
01:38:08.470 --> 01:38:08.480 align:start position:0%
are but i have no idea what threading is
 
01:38:11.750 --> 01:38:11.760 align:start position:0%
i'm on the wrong side of the uh
 
01:38:14.550 --> 01:38:14.560 align:start position:0%
dividing wall to uh to know that
 
01:38:17.910 --> 01:38:17.920 align:start position:0%
okay so so in in general threading is
 
01:38:20.709 --> 01:38:20.719 align:start position:0%
the it's the hair removal
 
01:38:23.669 --> 01:38:23.679 align:start position:0%
by use of a cotton thread by which the
 
01:38:25.830 --> 01:38:25.840 align:start position:0%
thread is
 
01:38:28.229 --> 01:38:28.239 align:start position:0%
wrapped around the the individual hairs
 
01:38:30.629 --> 01:38:30.639 align:start position:0%
and that is used to remove the hair
 
01:38:33.030 --> 01:38:33.040 align:start position:0%
additionally on page two of the bill
 
01:38:33.040 --> 01:38:34.070 align:start position:0%
additionally on page two of the bill
language

01:38:34.070 --> 01:38:34.080 align:start position:0%
language
 
01:38:36.550 --> 01:38:36.560 align:start position:0%
lines eight through eleven
 
01:38:39.109 --> 01:38:39.119 align:start position:0%
is um
 
01:38:41.750 --> 01:38:41.760 align:start position:0%
a statutory definition of threading and
 
01:38:45.590 --> 01:38:45.600 align:start position:0%
you you could refer to that thank you
 
01:38:45.600 --> 01:38:48.149 align:start position:0%
you you could refer to that thank you
representative

01:38:48.149 --> 01:38:48.159 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:38:51.189 --> 01:38:51.199 align:start position:0%
thank you representative power
 
01:38:51.199 --> 01:38:53.030 align:start position:0%
thank you representative power
when

01:38:53.030 --> 01:38:53.040 align:start position:0%
when
 
01:38:56.390 --> 01:38:56.400 align:start position:0%
when eyelash extensions are used
 
01:38:59.830 --> 01:38:59.840 align:start position:0%
does it not involve glue
 
01:39:01.510 --> 01:39:01.520 align:start position:0%
i'm over here okay
 
01:39:01.520 --> 01:39:02.870 align:start position:0%
i'm over here okay
sorry

01:39:02.870 --> 01:39:02.880 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
01:39:05.669 --> 01:39:05.679 align:start position:0%
if you could see you're looking for me
 
01:39:07.669 --> 01:39:07.679 align:start position:0%
so the question was
 
01:39:09.830 --> 01:39:09.840 align:start position:0%
does eyelash extension application
 
01:39:12.070 --> 01:39:12.080 align:start position:0%
involve the use of glue the answer is
 
01:39:14.070 --> 01:39:14.080 align:start position:0%
that it does involve the use of an
 
01:39:14.080 --> 01:39:15.430 align:start position:0%
that it does involve the use of an
adhesive

01:39:15.430 --> 01:39:15.440 align:start position:0%
adhesive
 
01:39:17.910 --> 01:39:17.920 align:start position:0%
and the adhesive is applied to the
 
01:39:17.920 --> 01:39:19.430 align:start position:0%
and the adhesive is applied to the
extension

01:39:19.430 --> 01:39:19.440 align:start position:0%
extension
 
01:39:21.510 --> 01:39:21.520 align:start position:0%
away from the client
 
01:39:24.149 --> 01:39:24.159 align:start position:0%
typically it it depends on the brand of
 
01:39:25.350 --> 01:39:25.360 align:start position:0%
the eyelash
 
01:39:28.149 --> 01:39:28.159 align:start position:0%
eyelash extension it
 
01:39:31.750 --> 01:39:31.760 align:start position:0%
may be found in a pot on on a ring that
 
01:39:33.669 --> 01:39:33.679 align:start position:0%
is placed on the
 
01:39:33.679 --> 01:39:35.510 align:start position:0%
is placed on the
provider's

01:39:35.510 --> 01:39:35.520 align:start position:0%
provider's
 
01:39:35.520 --> 01:39:36.550 align:start position:0%
provider's
finger

01:39:36.550 --> 01:39:36.560 align:start position:0%
finger
 
01:39:39.270 --> 01:39:39.280 align:start position:0%
the eyelash extension is the end of it
 
01:39:41.590 --> 01:39:41.600 align:start position:0%
is dipped into to that and then it is
 
01:39:44.629 --> 01:39:44.639 align:start position:0%
applied to the client's eye
 
01:39:44.639 --> 01:39:46.070 align:start position:0%
applied to the client's eye
alternatively

01:39:46.070 --> 01:39:46.080 align:start position:0%
alternatively
 
01:39:47.189 --> 01:39:47.199 align:start position:0%
a glove
 
01:39:47.199 --> 01:39:48.070 align:start position:0%
a glove
may

01:39:48.070 --> 01:39:48.080 align:start position:0%
may
 
01:39:51.189 --> 01:39:51.199 align:start position:0%
contain the adhesive similarly
 
01:39:53.430 --> 01:39:53.440 align:start position:0%
procedures the same and additionally i
 
01:39:56.070 --> 01:39:56.080 align:start position:0%
would add that
 
01:39:59.189 --> 01:39:59.199 align:start position:0%
the preparation of the client
 
01:40:01.750 --> 01:40:01.760 align:start position:0%
when doing eyelash extensions the the
 
01:40:04.310 --> 01:40:04.320 align:start position:0%
the bottom eyelash is isolated and
 
01:40:04.320 --> 01:40:05.669 align:start position:0%
the bottom eyelash is isolated and
draped

01:40:05.669 --> 01:40:05.679 align:start position:0%
draped
 
01:40:08.229 --> 01:40:08.239 align:start position:0%
there is a gel pad and a sticker that
 
01:40:11.189 --> 01:40:11.199 align:start position:0%
that keeps that eyelash
 
01:40:15.430 --> 01:40:15.440 align:start position:0%
underneath the preparation and also the
 
01:40:17.590 --> 01:40:17.600 align:start position:0%
upper eyelid is taped
 
01:40:19.590 --> 01:40:19.600 align:start position:0%
taped so that
 
01:40:20.870 --> 01:40:20.880 align:start position:0%
the eye
 
01:40:23.270 --> 01:40:23.280 align:start position:0%
lid will not open so the eye is not
 
01:40:26.149 --> 01:40:26.159 align:start position:0%
exposed the eyeball is not exposed it's
 
01:40:28.470 --> 01:40:28.480 align:start position:0%
it's closed and
 
01:40:31.990 --> 01:40:32.000 align:start position:0%
also the the glue has a setup time of a
 
01:40:34.070 --> 01:40:34.080 align:start position:0%
half a second to a second
 
01:40:38.310 --> 01:40:38.320 align:start position:0%
so there is in no very little chance
 
01:40:39.510 --> 01:40:39.520 align:start position:0%
that that's
 
01:40:43.030 --> 01:40:43.040 align:start position:0%
going to um be an issue and additionally
 
01:40:45.830 --> 01:40:45.840 align:start position:0%
the application of the eyelash extension
 
01:40:49.030 --> 01:40:49.040 align:start position:0%
it is applied to the eyelash and not to
 
01:40:53.270 --> 01:40:53.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:55.189 --> 01:40:55.199 align:start position:0%
follow up although that seems way too
 
01:40:57.350 --> 01:40:57.360 align:start position:0%
much information but right i didn't mean
 
01:40:59.030 --> 01:40:59.040 align:start position:0%
it to be so complicated i just wanted to
 
01:41:00.149 --> 01:41:00.159 align:start position:0%
make sure that
 
01:41:01.910 --> 01:41:01.920 align:start position:0%
would you not consider an adhesive a
 
01:41:01.920 --> 01:41:02.950 align:start position:0%
would you not consider an adhesive a
chemical

01:41:02.950 --> 01:41:02.960 align:start position:0%
chemical
 
01:41:04.390 --> 01:41:04.400 align:start position:0%
that's the yes or no question if you
 
01:41:08.950 --> 01:41:08.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:10.790 --> 01:41:10.800 align:start position:0%
there are yes
 
01:41:13.750 --> 01:41:13.760 align:start position:0%
a lot of things are chemical a solid a
 
01:41:16.709 --> 01:41:16.719 align:start position:0%
solid substance is chemically based

practices that you're outlining
 
01:41:54.950 --> 01:41:54.960 align:start position:0%
in this piece of legislation
 
01:41:57.270 --> 01:41:57.280 align:start position:0%
are any or all or some of these
 
01:41:59.350 --> 01:41:59.360 align:start position:0%
something that people can buy
 
01:42:02.470 --> 01:42:02.480 align:start position:0%
at the retail level and do themselves
 
01:42:04.709 --> 01:42:04.719 align:start position:0%
that is correct for the most part that
 
01:42:06.550 --> 01:42:06.560 align:start position:0%
that is in fact correct there are
 
01:42:09.990 --> 01:42:10.000 align:start position:0%
different you know levels of of products

for taking my question
 
01:42:48.149 --> 01:42:48.159 align:start position:0%
am i correct that the adhesive used for
 
01:42:50.550 --> 01:42:50.560 align:start position:0%
eyelash extensions is cyanoacrylic
 
01:42:50.560 --> 01:42:52.950 align:start position:0%
eyelash extensions is cyanoacrylic
adhesive

01:42:52.950 --> 01:42:52.960 align:start position:0%
adhesive

adhesive
um

01:42:54.550 --> 01:42:54.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:42:56.470 --> 01:42:56.480 align:start position:0%
i can't
 
01:42:58.950 --> 01:42:58.960 align:start position:0%
i can't attest to that for sure when i
 
01:42:58.960 --> 01:43:00.229 align:start position:0%
i can't attest to that for sure when i
did

01:43:00.229 --> 01:43:00.239 align:start position:0%
did
 
01:43:02.310 --> 01:43:02.320 align:start position:0%
i don't know the chemical composition of
 
01:43:04.709 --> 01:43:04.719 align:start position:0%
it offhand but i'd be happy to
 
01:43:07.109 --> 01:43:07.119 align:start position:0%
look that up and additionally
 
01:43:09.270 --> 01:43:09.280 align:start position:0%
when i did my research looking at
 
01:43:11.669 --> 01:43:11.679 align:start position:0%
different lines of eyelash extensions
 
01:43:14.149 --> 01:43:14.159 align:start position:0%
the adhesive is formulated differently
 
01:43:15.669 --> 01:43:15.679 align:start position:0%
and i
 
01:43:17.189 --> 01:43:17.199 align:start position:0%
i could look that up if you had a
 
01:43:17.199 --> 01:43:18.310 align:start position:0%
i could look that up if you had a
particular

01:43:18.310 --> 01:43:18.320 align:start position:0%
particular
 
01:43:18.320 --> 01:43:19.430 align:start position:0%
particular
brand

01:43:19.430 --> 01:43:19.440 align:start position:0%
brand
 
01:43:21.350 --> 01:43:21.360 align:start position:0%
that you were interested in we could
 
01:43:23.910 --> 01:43:23.920 align:start position:0%
look that up and get back to you my my
 
01:43:25.750 --> 01:43:25.760 align:start position:0%
particular concern relates to the fact
 
01:43:27.830 --> 01:43:27.840 align:start position:0%
that in a former life i was once asked

to see you
 
01:44:23.750 --> 01:44:23.760 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
01:44:26.950 --> 01:44:26.960 align:start position:0%
got a few things to say about
 
01:44:29.669 --> 01:44:29.679 align:start position:0%
this cosmetology business
 
01:44:29.679 --> 01:44:30.629 align:start position:0%
this cosmetology business
uh

01:44:30.629 --> 01:44:30.639 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:44:31.590 --> 01:44:31.600 align:start position:0%
one in
 
01:44:31.600 --> 01:44:32.709 align:start position:0%
one in
20

01:44:32.709 --> 01:44:32.719 align:start position:0%
20
 
01:44:35.430 --> 01:44:35.440 align:start position:0%
in the 1950s
 
01:44:39.030 --> 01:44:39.040 align:start position:0%
occupations were licensed
 
01:44:44.470 --> 01:44:44.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:45.990 --> 01:44:46.000 align:start position:0%
which is uh
 
01:44:48.229 --> 01:44:48.239 align:start position:0%
pretty astounding in other words you
 
01:44:50.550 --> 01:44:50.560 align:start position:0%
didn't really need much of a license to
 
01:44:54.149 --> 01:44:54.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:56.870 --> 01:44:56.880 align:start position:0%
another thing um
 
01:44:59.270 --> 01:44:59.280 align:start position:0%
we're talking about money i believe
 
01:45:02.310 --> 01:45:02.320 align:start position:0%
representative payer said that uh it
 
01:45:04.390 --> 01:45:04.400 align:start position:0%
cost about nineteen thousand dollars to
 
01:45:06.629 --> 01:45:06.639 align:start position:0%
get an education
 
01:45:09.109 --> 01:45:09.119 align:start position:0%
for cosmetology
 
01:45:09.119 --> 01:45:10.629 align:start position:0%
for cosmetology
now

01:45:10.629 --> 01:45:10.639 align:start position:0%
now
 
01:45:13.109 --> 01:45:13.119 align:start position:0%
i actually ran across an article my
 
01:45:14.790 --> 01:45:14.800 align:start position:0%
wife's a hairdresser she's been a
 
01:45:18.070 --> 01:45:18.080 align:start position:0%
hairdresser since 1965.
 
01:45:20.149 --> 01:45:20.159 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
01:45:21.830 --> 01:45:21.840 align:start position:0%
what happened when we when they started
 
01:45:25.189 --> 01:45:25.199 align:start position:0%
giving government loans
 
01:45:28.310 --> 01:45:28.320 align:start position:0%
all right it became a cash cow for these
 
01:45:30.629 --> 01:45:30.639 align:start position:0%
uh beauty schools
 
01:45:31.990 --> 01:45:32.000 align:start position:0%
and this is
 
01:45:33.590 --> 01:45:33.600 align:start position:0%
i mean it's
 
01:45:35.189 --> 01:45:35.199 align:start position:0%
a matter of fact in new york they
 
01:45:37.270 --> 01:45:37.280 align:start position:0%
actually brought some people to trial
 
01:45:37.280 --> 01:45:38.709 align:start position:0%
actually brought some people to trial
and

01:45:38.709 --> 01:45:38.719 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:45:41.910 --> 01:45:41.920 align:start position:0%
when some went to jail
 
01:45:45.109 --> 01:45:45.119 align:start position:0%
that's not very good new york speaking
 
01:45:47.990 --> 01:45:48.000 align:start position:0%
of new york uh the
 
01:45:50.709 --> 01:45:50.719 align:start position:0%
requirements there are a thousand hours
 
01:45:53.350 --> 01:45:53.360 align:start position:0%
versus 1500 in new hampshire which which
 
01:45:56.149 --> 01:45:56.159 align:start position:0%
has been mentioned
 
01:45:56.159 --> 01:45:57.270 align:start position:0%
has been mentioned
that's

01:45:57.270 --> 01:45:57.280 align:start position:0%
that's
 
01:46:00.229 --> 01:46:00.239 align:start position:0%
you know it's it's a bit excessive uh
 
01:46:03.030 --> 01:46:03.040 align:start position:0%
these beauty schools they actually
 
01:46:03.040 --> 01:46:05.350 align:start position:0%
these beauty schools they actually
um

01:46:05.350 --> 01:46:05.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:46:06.870 --> 01:46:06.880 align:start position:0%
they do a lot of
 
01:46:09.430 --> 01:46:09.440 align:start position:0%
obviously they got the kids are gonna
 
01:46:10.950 --> 01:46:10.960 align:start position:0%
the people
 
01:46:13.189 --> 01:46:13.199 align:start position:0%
the kids the students have got to
 
01:46:15.910 --> 01:46:15.920 align:start position:0%
practice so it's a revenue stream also
 
01:46:17.830 --> 01:46:17.840 align:start position:0%
because people come off the street and
 
01:46:20.390 --> 01:46:20.400 align:start position:0%
they go to the beauty school and
 
01:46:23.430 --> 01:46:23.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:25.910 --> 01:46:25.920 align:start position:0%
that's that's pretty bad one other point
 
01:46:28.149 --> 01:46:28.159 align:start position:0%
i wanted to make was
 
01:46:31.750 --> 01:46:31.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:34.310 --> 01:46:34.320 align:start position:0%
requirements all right my one like i
 
01:46:36.390 --> 01:46:36.400 align:start position:0%
said my wife has been a hairdresser for
 
01:46:39.590 --> 01:46:39.600 align:start position:0%
uh since 1965.
 
01:46:39.600 --> 01:46:41.350 align:start position:0%
uh since 1965.
she

01:46:41.350 --> 01:46:41.360 align:start position:0%
she
 
01:46:43.669 --> 01:46:43.679 align:start position:0%
all right she she kept up her license i
 
01:46:45.669 --> 01:46:45.679 align:start position:0%
mean and and sometimes you have a lapse
 
01:46:46.950 --> 01:46:46.960 align:start position:0%
in license
 
01:46:48.550 --> 01:46:48.560 align:start position:0%
and what
 
01:46:50.229 --> 01:46:50.239 align:start position:0%
one time we you know because she missed
 
01:46:51.669 --> 01:46:51.679 align:start position:0%
it she might miss it a couple enemies
 
01:46:53.590 --> 01:46:53.600 align:start position:0%
not higher on a priority list i mean
 
01:46:53.600 --> 01:46:55.189 align:start position:0%
not higher on a priority list i mean
she's

01:46:55.189 --> 01:46:55.199 align:start position:0%
she's
 
01:46:57.109 --> 01:46:57.119 align:start position:0%
getting to be a young lady
 
01:47:00.870 --> 01:47:00.880 align:start position:0%
she does my hair too i hope you like it
 
01:47:00.880 --> 01:47:02.390 align:start position:0%
she does my hair too i hope you like it
but

01:47:02.390 --> 01:47:02.400 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:47:04.870 --> 01:47:04.880 align:start position:0%
the fact is if you let it lapse you have
 
01:47:06.550 --> 01:47:06.560 align:start position:0%
to go through all these requirements
 
01:47:06.560 --> 01:47:08.149 align:start position:0%
to go through all these requirements
again

01:47:08.149 --> 01:47:08.159 align:start position:0%
again
 
01:47:11.430 --> 01:47:11.440 align:start position:0%
you know under 313 a 11.
 
01:47:14.149 --> 01:47:14.159 align:start position:0%
and that's that shouldn't be now so and
 
01:47:15.750 --> 01:47:15.760 align:start position:0%
i think it's discretionary because
 
01:47:15.760 --> 01:47:16.870 align:start position:0%
i think it's discretionary because
sometimes

01:47:16.870 --> 01:47:16.880 align:start position:0%
sometimes
 
01:47:18.870 --> 01:47:18.880 align:start position:0%
she's done it and they said we'll just
 
01:47:20.950 --> 01:47:20.960 align:start position:0%
pay the fee this time and that's that's
 
01:47:23.189 --> 01:47:23.199 align:start position:0%
fine and the reason is
 
01:47:26.310 --> 01:47:26.320 align:start position:0%
is because when you go to some beauty uh
 
01:47:27.830 --> 01:47:27.840 align:start position:0%
supply places
 
01:47:30.550 --> 01:47:30.560 align:start position:0%
you need to show a license
 
01:47:30.560 --> 01:47:32.310 align:start position:0%
you need to show a license
and

01:47:32.310 --> 01:47:32.320 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:47:34.149 --> 01:47:34.159 align:start position:0%
they will not sell the product to you if
 
01:47:36.870 --> 01:47:36.880 align:start position:0%
you don't have a license
 
01:47:36.880 --> 01:47:37.750 align:start position:0%
you don't have a license
that's

01:47:37.750 --> 01:47:37.760 align:start position:0%
that's
 
01:47:40.390 --> 01:47:40.400 align:start position:0%
that to me is you know it's important uh
 
01:47:42.070 --> 01:47:42.080 align:start position:0%
you know her i mean you know she and she
 
01:47:42.080 --> 01:47:43.030 align:start position:0%
you know her i mean you know she and she
does

01:47:43.030 --> 01:47:43.040 align:start position:0%
does
 
01:47:45.350 --> 01:47:45.360 align:start position:0%
you know if you can't read i mean that
 
01:47:47.910 --> 01:47:47.920 align:start position:0%
that's the basic thing with cosmetology
 
01:47:50.550 --> 01:47:50.560 align:start position:0%
you got to make sure that you read
 
01:47:50.560 --> 01:47:51.430 align:start position:0%
you got to make sure that you read
the

01:47:51.430 --> 01:47:51.440 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:47:53.750 --> 01:47:53.760 align:start position:0%
the perm or the whatever and make sure
 
01:47:55.109 --> 01:47:55.119 align:start position:0%
that it gets
 
01:47:56.709 --> 01:47:56.719 align:start position:0%
you have it right because you can
 
01:47:58.310 --> 01:47:58.320 align:start position:0%
obviously you can burn somebody's head
 
01:48:00.470 --> 01:48:00.480 align:start position:0%
and whatever and that's
 
01:48:03.350 --> 01:48:03.360 align:start position:0%
but do you need 1500 hours to do this
 
01:48:03.360 --> 01:48:04.629 align:start position:0%
but do you need 1500 hours to do this
plus

01:48:04.629 --> 01:48:04.639 align:start position:0%
plus
 
01:48:06.950 --> 01:48:06.960 align:start position:0%
some apprenticeship after that i mean
 
01:48:10.310 --> 01:48:10.320 align:start position:0%
that's that's that's quite excessive
 
01:48:10.320 --> 01:48:11.270 align:start position:0%
that's that's that's quite excessive
so

01:48:11.270 --> 01:48:11.280 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:48:13.750 --> 01:48:13.760 align:start position:0%
hopefully uh you'll
 
01:48:13.760 --> 01:48:14.470 align:start position:0%
hopefully uh you'll
look

01:48:14.470 --> 01:48:14.480 align:start position:0%
look
 
01:48:16.709 --> 01:48:16.719 align:start position:0%

for public policy we're in new
 
01:49:19.350 --> 01:49:19.360 align:start position:0%
hampshire's free market think tank and
 
01:49:21.750 --> 01:49:21.760 align:start position:0%
i'll try to sum up our um
 
01:49:23.589 --> 01:49:23.599 align:start position:0%
analysis of this bill rather quickly we
 
01:49:25.589 --> 01:49:25.599 align:start position:0%
think this bill would achieve two
 
01:49:28.550 --> 01:49:28.560 align:start position:0%
positive goals where it to pass one is
 
01:49:30.149 --> 01:49:30.159 align:start position:0%
that by creating separate legal
 
01:49:32.790 --> 01:49:32.800 align:start position:0%
categories of niche beauty services that
 
01:49:35.109 --> 01:49:35.119 align:start position:0%
don't require expensive time-consuming
 
01:49:38.070 --> 01:49:38.080 align:start position:0%
and unnecessary licensure we can expect
 
01:49:39.830 --> 01:49:39.840 align:start position:0%
this bill to lead to a flurry of
 
01:49:41.350 --> 01:49:41.360 align:start position:0%
entrepreneurship in new hampshire and
 
01:49:43.830 --> 01:49:43.840 align:start position:0%
i'm going to give you some examples
 
01:49:45.270 --> 01:49:45.280 align:start position:0%
i don't know how many of you are
 
01:49:48.070 --> 01:49:48.080 align:start position:0%
familiar with blow dry bars these are
 
01:49:49.589 --> 01:49:49.599 align:start position:0%
you know a very hot beauty trend right
 
01:49:52.390 --> 01:49:52.400 align:start position:0%
now it is a sort of a semi salon where
 
01:49:54.390 --> 01:49:54.400 align:start position:0%
you can come in and
 
01:49:58.229 --> 01:49:58.239 align:start position:0%
only get a wash shampoo blow dry a
 
01:50:00.629 --> 01:50:00.639 align:start position:0%
couple of you know quick beauty services
 
01:50:02.709 --> 01:50:02.719 align:start position:0%
they do not do haircuts it's not a
 
01:50:05.109 --> 01:50:05.119 align:start position:0%
full-service salon so it's a very quick
 
01:50:07.270 --> 01:50:07.280 align:start position:0%
short thing women use them a lot for
 
01:50:09.510 --> 01:50:09.520 align:start position:0%
weddings going out on the weekends
 
01:50:11.589 --> 01:50:11.599 align:start position:0%
special events that kind of thing
 
01:50:13.030 --> 01:50:13.040 align:start position:0%
to my knowledge they're only two in new
 
01:50:14.390 --> 01:50:14.400 align:start position:0%
hampshire right now
 
01:50:16.070 --> 01:50:16.080 align:start position:0%
and one of the reasons is you have to
 
01:50:18.390 --> 01:50:18.400 align:start position:0%
have a full cosmetology license to offer
 
01:50:20.790 --> 01:50:20.800 align:start position:0%
these services and that is as a previous
 
01:50:23.510 --> 01:50:23.520 align:start position:0%
speaker mentioned 1500 hours of training
 
01:50:25.589 --> 01:50:25.599 align:start position:0%
massachusetts by the way requires only a
 
01:50:27.589 --> 01:50:27.599 align:start position:0%
thousand hours of training to be a
 
01:50:29.830 --> 01:50:29.840 align:start position:0%
cosmetologist we require 1500 hours of
 
01:50:32.950 --> 01:50:32.960 align:start position:0%
training or 3 000 hours over two years
 
01:50:32.960 --> 01:50:34.470 align:start position:0%
training or 3 000 hours over two years
as

01:50:34.470 --> 01:50:34.480 align:start position:0%
as
 
01:50:36.310 --> 01:50:36.320 align:start position:0%
serving under a licensed cosmetologist
 
01:50:39.589 --> 01:50:39.599 align:start position:0%
there's a massive amount of training
 
01:50:42.229 --> 01:50:42.239 align:start position:0%
low much higher 30 percent higher 33
 
01:50:44.229 --> 01:50:44.239 align:start position:0%
higher than massachusetts
 
01:50:45.830 --> 01:50:45.840 align:start position:0%
you have to go through that training
 
01:50:48.070 --> 01:50:48.080 align:start position:0%
just to open a blow drive bar
 
01:50:52.149 --> 01:50:52.159 align:start position:0%
that would do shampoos and blow dries
 
01:50:53.910 --> 01:50:53.920 align:start position:0%
some of them offer makeup application as
 
01:50:57.430 --> 01:50:57.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:58.790 --> 01:50:58.800 align:start position:0%
that level of licensure and
 
01:51:01.350 --> 01:51:01.360 align:start position:0%
certification is just not necessary to
 
01:51:03.270 --> 01:51:03.280 align:start position:0%
offer these niche beauty services all
 
01:51:04.870 --> 01:51:04.880 align:start position:0%
the disputed services that are covered
 
01:51:06.950 --> 01:51:06.960 align:start position:0%
in this bill
 
01:51:09.430 --> 01:51:09.440 align:start position:0%
would now if this bill passes
 
01:51:11.350 --> 01:51:11.360 align:start position:0%
be able to be provided without going
 
01:51:13.589 --> 01:51:13.599 align:start position:0%
through that massive level of additional
 
01:51:15.910 --> 01:51:15.920 align:start position:0%
training for services that these
 
01:51:18.470 --> 01:51:18.480 align:start position:0%
providers would never offer
 
01:51:20.390 --> 01:51:20.400 align:start position:0%
so if you open a niche beauty service
 
01:51:23.270 --> 01:51:23.280 align:start position:0%
salon after the spill passes you would
 
01:51:26.070 --> 01:51:26.080 align:start position:0%
not be allowed to provide the
 
01:51:27.830 --> 01:51:27.840 align:start position:0%
higher level training services that a
 
01:51:29.910 --> 01:51:29.920 align:start position:0%
cosmetology license requires
 
01:51:31.990 --> 01:51:32.000 align:start position:0%
so by lowering that buried entry we
 
01:51:33.510 --> 01:51:33.520 align:start position:0%
think you're going to see a lot more
 
01:51:35.510 --> 01:51:35.520 align:start position:0%
entrepreneurship in new hampshire a lot
 
01:51:37.030 --> 01:51:37.040 align:start position:0%
more small businesses pop up not just
 
01:51:39.109 --> 01:51:39.119 align:start position:0%
blow dry salons but
 
01:51:40.470 --> 01:51:40.480 align:start position:0%
all the other niche services makeup
 
01:51:42.070 --> 01:51:42.080 align:start position:0%
application for example
 
01:51:42.080 --> 01:51:43.350 align:start position:0%
application for example
so

01:51:43.350 --> 01:51:43.360 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:51:44.790 --> 01:51:44.800 align:start position:0%
and i'll give you another example of
 
01:51:46.310 --> 01:51:46.320 align:start position:0%
another thing this bill does that hasn't
 
01:51:49.669 --> 01:51:49.679 align:start position:0%
been talked about most states
 
01:51:51.910 --> 01:51:51.920 align:start position:0%
have a list of exceptions to the
 
01:51:53.750 --> 01:51:53.760 align:start position:0%
cosmetology license
 
01:51:53.760 --> 01:51:54.790 align:start position:0%
cosmetology license
for

01:51:54.790 --> 01:51:54.800 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:51:54.800 --> 01:51:56.470 align:start position:0%
for
theatrical

01:51:56.470 --> 01:51:56.480 align:start position:0%
theatrical
 
01:51:58.950 --> 01:51:58.960 align:start position:0%
production and demonstration so if you
 
01:52:00.950 --> 01:52:00.960 align:start position:0%
go to the macy's in the mall you see the
 
01:52:02.709 --> 01:52:02.719 align:start position:0%
ladies there offering makeup
 
01:52:04.950 --> 01:52:04.960 align:start position:0%
demonstrations they in new hampshire
 
01:52:07.750 --> 01:52:07.760 align:start position:0%
have to have a cosmetology license
 
01:52:10.470 --> 01:52:10.480 align:start position:0%
in 40 other states they do not
 
01:52:12.310 --> 01:52:12.320 align:start position:0%
in vermont they do not
 
01:52:14.629 --> 01:52:14.639 align:start position:0%
so every bordering state in new
 
01:52:14.639 --> 01:52:15.669 align:start position:0%
so every bordering state in new
hampshire

01:52:15.669 --> 01:52:15.679 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
01:52:17.830 --> 01:52:17.840 align:start position:0%
has exemptions for
 
01:52:19.750 --> 01:52:19.760 align:start position:0%
some form of either demonstration of a
 
01:52:24.149 --> 01:52:24.159 align:start position:0%
makeup product or theatrical television
 
01:52:24.159 --> 01:52:25.270 align:start position:0%
makeup product or theatrical television
studio

01:52:25.270 --> 01:52:25.280 align:start position:0%
studio
 
01:52:27.189 --> 01:52:27.199 align:start position:0%
and modeling so you wouldn't have to
 
01:52:29.270 --> 01:52:29.280 align:start position:0%
have a cosmetology license to put makeup
 
01:52:30.950 --> 01:52:30.960 align:start position:0%
on at the palace theater
 
01:52:30.960 --> 01:52:31.910 align:start position:0%
on at the palace theater
or

01:52:31.910 --> 01:52:31.920 align:start position:0%
or
 
01:52:33.990 --> 01:52:34.000 align:start position:0%
and this is a favorite pet peeve of mine
 
01:52:35.750 --> 01:52:35.760 align:start position:0%
for the new hampshire primary when cnn
 
01:52:37.589 --> 01:52:37.599 align:start position:0%
comes and all the network television
 
01:52:39.990 --> 01:52:40.000 align:start position:0%
stations come in new hampshire the
 
01:52:41.830 --> 01:52:41.840 align:start position:0%
people who put the makeup on there are
 
01:52:43.589 --> 01:52:43.599 align:start position:0%
not exempted from having cosmetology
 
01:52:46.550 --> 01:52:46.560 align:start position:0%
license so to put powder on
 
01:52:49.669 --> 01:52:49.679 align:start position:0%
a state senator to do a tv hit for
 
01:52:52.070 --> 01:52:52.080 align:start position:0%
c-span that person in new hampshire is
 
01:52:53.510 --> 01:52:53.520 align:start position:0%
not exempted from the cosmetology
 
01:52:56.070 --> 01:52:56.080 align:start position:0%
license in vermont they are
 
01:52:58.310 --> 01:52:58.320 align:start position:0%
in massachusetts there's a special carve
 
01:53:01.350 --> 01:53:01.360 align:start position:0%
out for demonstrators in maine their
 
01:53:03.189 --> 01:53:03.199 align:start position:0%
exemption is almost identical to the one
 
01:53:04.629 --> 01:53:04.639 align:start position:0%
in this bill so they carve out for
 
01:53:07.350 --> 01:53:07.360 align:start position:0%
theater for demonstrations so just to
 
01:53:08.870 --> 01:53:08.880 align:start position:0%
give you an example
 
01:53:10.550 --> 01:53:10.560 align:start position:0%
if bernie sanders
 
01:53:12.950 --> 01:53:12.960 align:start position:0%
were to join a theatrical production in
 
01:53:14.790 --> 01:53:14.800 align:start position:0%
burlington vermont and get his makeup
 
01:53:16.709 --> 01:53:16.719 align:start position:0%
put on he would not have to have a
 
01:53:18.390 --> 01:53:18.400 align:start position:0%
cosmetologist do it
 
01:53:20.149 --> 01:53:20.159 align:start position:0%
but if he were to come to new hampshire
 
01:53:22.310 --> 01:53:22.320 align:start position:0%
and run for president again
 
01:53:24.390 --> 01:53:24.400 align:start position:0%
and do a cnn hit from manchester he
 
01:53:25.750 --> 01:53:25.760 align:start position:0%
would have to have a cosmetologist put
 
01:53:27.270 --> 01:53:27.280 align:start position:0%
his powder on
 
01:53:29.350 --> 01:53:29.360 align:start position:0%
i don't think there's anybody who could
 
01:53:31.189 --> 01:53:31.199 align:start position:0%
justify this from a public health or
 
01:53:31.199 --> 01:53:32.470 align:start position:0%
justify this from a public health or
safety

01:53:32.470 --> 01:53:32.480 align:start position:0%
safety
 
01:53:33.990 --> 01:53:34.000 align:start position:0%
standpoint so that's just one of the
 
01:53:35.589 --> 01:53:35.599 align:start position:0%
things that this bill would clean up
 
01:53:37.030 --> 01:53:37.040 align:start position:0%
right it would allow those exemptions
 
01:53:39.030 --> 01:53:39.040 align:start position:0%
and we think that would be a good thing
 
01:53:40.790 --> 01:53:40.800 align:start position:0%
so it would allow for entrepreneurship
 
01:53:42.470 --> 01:53:42.480 align:start position:0%
it would allow for
 
01:53:44.870 --> 01:53:44.880 align:start position:0%
more people to enter this profession uh
 
01:53:46.390 --> 01:53:46.400 align:start position:0%
especially during the primary i don't
 
01:53:48.470 --> 01:53:48.480 align:start position:0%
know how many of you do tv hits during
 
01:53:49.910 --> 01:53:49.920 align:start position:0%
the primary but there's a shortage of
 
01:53:49.920 --> 01:53:51.109 align:start position:0%
the primary but there's a shortage of
makeup

01:53:51.109 --> 01:53:51.119 align:start position:0%
makeup
 
01:53:53.830 --> 01:53:53.840 align:start position:0%
applicators during the primary and this
 
01:53:53.840 --> 01:53:54.629 align:start position:0%
applicators during the primary and this
would

01:53:54.629 --> 01:53:54.639 align:start position:0%
would
 
01:53:54.639 --> 01:53:55.830 align:start position:0%
would
help

01:53:55.830 --> 01:53:55.840 align:start position:0%
help
 
01:53:58.470 --> 01:53:58.480 align:start position:0%
alleviate that it would also bring the
 
01:53:58.480 --> 01:53:59.189 align:start position:0%
alleviate that it would also bring the
other

01:53:59.189 --> 01:53:59.199 align:start position:0%
other
 
01:54:01.109 --> 01:54:01.119 align:start position:0%
effect that we think this would have is
 
01:54:03.189 --> 01:54:03.199 align:start position:0%
it would bring people out of the black
 
01:54:03.199 --> 01:54:04.149 align:start position:0%
it would bring people out of the black
market

01:54:04.149 --> 01:54:04.159 align:start position:0%
market
 
01:54:04.159 --> 01:54:04.870 align:start position:0%
market
so

01:54:04.870 --> 01:54:04.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:54:05.990 --> 01:54:06.000 align:start position:0%
right now
 
01:54:07.830 --> 01:54:07.840 align:start position:0%
to providing these services you have to
 
01:54:09.430 --> 01:54:09.440 align:start position:0%
have a cosmetology license well what do
 
01:54:11.189 --> 01:54:11.199 align:start position:0%
you think happens when you have this
 
01:54:13.669 --> 01:54:13.679 align:start position:0%
barrier that's about a 20 000
 
01:54:15.510 --> 01:54:15.520 align:start position:0%
um license because you have to go to
 
01:54:16.629 --> 01:54:16.639 align:start position:0%
school for it and then you have to have
 
01:54:18.229 --> 01:54:18.239 align:start position:0%
all those hours of training
 
01:54:20.870 --> 01:54:20.880 align:start position:0%
people do it on the side
 
01:54:22.070 --> 01:54:22.080 align:start position:0%
right to their friends and family in
 
01:54:23.350 --> 01:54:23.360 align:start position:0%
their neighborhood they do these
 
01:54:26.550 --> 01:54:26.560 align:start position:0%
services and that's outside it's kind of
 
01:54:28.470 --> 01:54:28.480 align:start position:0%
an illicit market so
 
01:54:30.550 --> 01:54:30.560 align:start position:0%
by removing those heavy license
 
01:54:31.990 --> 01:54:32.000 align:start position:0%
requirements we think this would pull
 
01:54:34.149 --> 01:54:34.159 align:start position:0%
that into the light and you'd have a lot
 
01:54:36.310 --> 01:54:36.320 align:start position:0%
more people trying to open up salons and
 
01:54:38.310 --> 01:54:38.320 align:start position:0%
do more legit businesses and that would
 
01:54:40.310 --> 01:54:40.320 align:start position:0%
be a good thing for new hampshire
 
01:54:43.430 --> 01:54:43.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:45.830 --> 01:54:45.840 align:start position:0%
representative o'brien
 
01:54:47.750 --> 01:54:47.760 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you mr
 
01:54:50.709 --> 01:54:50.719 align:start position:0%

01:55:00.310 --> 01:55:00.320 align:start position:0%
say on some you know
 
01:55:01.910 --> 01:55:01.920 align:start position:0%
business skills
 
01:55:04.310 --> 01:55:04.320 align:start position:0%
can't get tongue tied at times but you
 
01:55:05.830 --> 01:55:05.840 align:start position:0%
know what i mean
 
01:55:07.109 --> 01:55:07.119 align:start position:0%
well that's good
 
01:55:09.350 --> 01:55:09.360 align:start position:0%
but what i'm more focused with is the
 
01:55:11.189 --> 01:55:11.199 align:start position:0%
work and i'll give you the
 
01:55:13.510 --> 01:55:13.520 align:start position:0%
the focus that i'm talking about you
 
01:55:15.790 --> 01:55:15.800 align:start position:0%
take somebody that did invest into
 
01:55:19.189 --> 01:55:19.199 align:start position:0%
cosmetology school and graduated paid
 
01:55:20.550 --> 01:55:20.560 align:start position:0%
all that money
 
01:55:20.560 --> 01:55:21.430 align:start position:0%
all that money
now

01:55:21.430 --> 01:55:21.440 align:start position:0%
now
 
01:55:23.669 --> 01:55:23.679 align:start position:0%
tries to work in this type of business
 
01:55:26.790 --> 01:55:26.800 align:start position:0%
would have to be working at a lower wage
 
01:55:29.510 --> 01:55:29.520 align:start position:0%
so can you try to convince me that this
 
01:55:31.350 --> 01:55:31.360 align:start position:0%
is not an attempt
 
01:55:33.669 --> 01:55:33.679 align:start position:0%
to go against the education that some of
 
01:55:34.870 --> 01:55:34.880 align:start position:0%
these people
 
01:55:36.709 --> 01:55:36.719 align:start position:0%
really strive to get
 
01:55:39.990 --> 01:55:40.000 align:start position:0%
and replace them with a low-grade single
 
01:55:42.550 --> 01:55:42.560 align:start position:0%
focus type of worker i mean this seems
 
01:55:45.750 --> 01:55:45.760 align:start position:0%
to be an anti-labor type of movement
 
01:55:48.390 --> 01:55:48.400 align:start position:0%
that i'm seeing right now
 
01:55:50.390 --> 01:55:50.400 align:start position:0%
i think you know i hear the question and
 
01:55:52.310 --> 01:55:52.320 align:start position:0%
i um i don't see it that way and i think
 
01:55:54.149 --> 01:55:54.159 align:start position:0%
that analysis is incorrect for a couple
 
01:55:55.830 --> 01:55:55.840 align:start position:0%
of reasons for one is
 
01:55:58.310 --> 01:55:58.320 align:start position:0%
this does not eliminate the cosmetology
 
01:55:58.320 --> 01:55:59.589 align:start position:0%
this does not eliminate the cosmetology
license

01:55:59.589 --> 01:55:59.599 align:start position:0%
license
 
01:55:59.599 --> 01:56:00.550 align:start position:0%
license
that

01:56:00.550 --> 01:56:00.560 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:56:03.030 --> 01:56:03.040 align:start position:0%
remains a very valuable thing right so
 
01:56:04.950 --> 01:56:04.960 align:start position:0%
if you want to offer a full service
 
01:56:06.629 --> 01:56:06.639 align:start position:0%
salon you still have to get that
 
01:56:08.390 --> 01:56:08.400 align:start position:0%
cosmetology license that is a separate
 
01:56:11.270 --> 01:56:11.280 align:start position:0%
level of services and that is not going
 
01:56:12.470 --> 01:56:12.480 align:start position:0%
to go away
 
01:56:15.270 --> 01:56:15.280 align:start position:0%
so this bill doesn't take away
 
01:56:17.189 --> 01:56:17.199 align:start position:0%
any service from the cosmetologist
 
01:56:18.709 --> 01:56:18.719 align:start position:0%
cosmetologists can still offer
 
01:56:20.390 --> 01:56:20.400 align:start position:0%
everything they offer now
 
01:56:20.400 --> 01:56:21.270 align:start position:0%
everything they offer now
um

01:56:21.270 --> 01:56:21.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:56:24.310 --> 01:56:24.320 align:start position:0%
all this bill does is take
 
01:56:26.229 --> 01:56:26.239 align:start position:0%
a small subset of services like i said
 
01:56:28.310 --> 01:56:28.320 align:start position:0%
that the low skilled services compared
 
01:56:31.030 --> 01:56:31.040 align:start position:0%
to a full cosmetology license
 
01:56:33.270 --> 01:56:33.280 align:start position:0%
and i just want that relative low skill
 
01:56:35.030 --> 01:56:35.040 align:start position:0%
to be clear they're not entirely low
 
01:56:36.149 --> 01:56:36.159 align:start position:0%
skilled but compared to a full
 
01:56:38.950 --> 01:56:38.960 align:start position:0%
cosmetologist right so
 
01:56:41.109 --> 01:56:41.119 align:start position:0%
um it's simple things like the sponsor
 
01:56:44.070 --> 01:56:44.080 align:start position:0%
said so washing and blow drying hair
 
01:56:46.390 --> 01:56:46.400 align:start position:0%
so state licensure exists to protect
 
01:56:48.229 --> 01:56:48.239 align:start position:0%
public health and safety
 
01:56:50.709 --> 01:56:50.719 align:start position:0%
if a particular service is lumped into a
 
01:56:52.709 --> 01:56:52.719 align:start position:0%
bigger license and there is no public
 
01:56:54.310 --> 01:56:54.320 align:start position:0%
health or safety need for that then the
 
01:56:57.750 --> 01:56:57.760 align:start position:0%
state is doing the economy a disservice
 
01:57:00.310 --> 01:57:00.320 align:start position:0%
because it is making people pay
 
01:57:00.320 --> 01:57:01.109 align:start position:0%
because it is making people pay
um

01:57:01.109 --> 01:57:01.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:57:02.470 --> 01:57:02.480 align:start position:0%
a lot more
 
01:57:05.830 --> 01:57:05.840 align:start position:0%
and go into a certain license uh to a
 
01:57:07.270 --> 01:57:07.280 align:start position:0%
certain legislative professional for
 
01:57:09.270 --> 01:57:09.280 align:start position:0%
something they don't need to right
 
01:57:10.950 --> 01:57:10.960 align:start position:0%
that's licensed professional can still
 
01:57:12.390 --> 01:57:12.400 align:start position:0%
do that service and if somebody values
 
01:57:14.550 --> 01:57:14.560 align:start position:0%
that and wants that they can but just
 
01:57:15.990 --> 01:57:16.000 align:start position:0%
for shampooing and hair cutting and
 
01:57:17.589 --> 01:57:17.599 align:start position:0%
makeup application if they only want
 
01:57:19.830 --> 01:57:19.840 align:start position:0%
those little things or eyebrow threading
 
01:57:21.830 --> 01:57:21.840 align:start position:0%
right they can go to somebody else and
 
01:57:25.350 --> 01:57:25.360 align:start position:0%
do it so it just it actually um
 
01:57:26.870 --> 01:57:26.880 align:start position:0%
doesn't hurt the cosmetologist because
 
01:57:28.709 --> 01:57:28.719 align:start position:0%
they can still do the full service but
 
01:57:29.910 --> 01:57:29.920 align:start position:0%
it allows
 
01:57:32.229 --> 01:57:32.239 align:start position:0%
other people particularly low-income
 
01:57:33.830 --> 01:57:33.840 align:start position:0%
women who offer a lot of these type of
 
01:57:35.910 --> 01:57:35.920 align:start position:0%
threading services um just like with
 
01:57:37.350 --> 01:57:37.360 align:start position:0%
hair braiding
 
01:57:38.629 --> 01:57:38.639 align:start position:0%
a few years ago
 
01:57:40.629 --> 01:57:40.639 align:start position:0%
it really allows them
 
01:57:42.550 --> 01:57:42.560 align:start position:0%
a way to get into the field and make a
 
01:57:45.750 --> 01:57:45.760 align:start position:0%
living and that's really what it's about
 
01:57:47.270 --> 01:57:47.280 align:start position:0%
thank you mr klein and thank you mr
 
01:57:47.280 --> 01:57:48.470 align:start position:0%
thank you mr klein and thank you mr
chairman

01:57:48.470 --> 01:57:48.480 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
01:57:51.510 --> 01:57:51.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:52.790 --> 01:57:52.800 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:57:55.830 --> 01:57:55.840 align:start position:0%
what data do you have that
 
01:57:58.310 --> 01:57:58.320 align:start position:0%
women who would
 
01:58:01.430 --> 01:58:01.440 align:start position:0%
blow dry and wash and blow dry your hair
 
01:58:04.070 --> 01:58:04.080 align:start position:0%
at one of these establishments
 
01:58:05.589 --> 01:58:05.599 align:start position:0%
would provide
 
01:58:07.350 --> 01:58:07.360 align:start position:0%
that service
 
01:58:09.109 --> 01:58:09.119 align:start position:0%
at less money
 
01:58:11.990 --> 01:58:12.000 align:start position:0%
than a bee salon
 
01:58:13.510 --> 01:58:13.520 align:start position:0%
thank you i think that's a little bit of
 
01:58:15.350 --> 01:58:15.360 align:start position:0%
a misnomer we're not saying that the
 
01:58:17.270 --> 01:58:17.280 align:start position:0%
services would necessarily cost less i
 
01:58:18.310 --> 01:58:18.320 align:start position:0%
don't know what they would cost that
 
01:58:21.030 --> 01:58:21.040 align:start position:0%
depends on the market what we're saying
 
01:58:23.109 --> 01:58:23.119 align:start position:0%
is that there's no public health or
 
01:58:25.350 --> 01:58:25.360 align:start position:0%
safety justification
 
01:58:27.669 --> 01:58:27.679 align:start position:0%
for having these services tied to a
 
01:58:29.750 --> 01:58:29.760 align:start position:0%
cosmetology license because there's
 
01:58:31.990 --> 01:58:32.000 align:start position:0%
they're not unsafe to offer without that
 
01:58:33.669 --> 01:58:33.679 align:start position:0%
level of training
 
01:58:33.679 --> 01:58:35.030 align:start position:0%
level of training
so

01:58:35.030 --> 01:58:35.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:58:36.709 --> 01:58:36.719 align:start position:0%
i i think you'd have to go look at what
 
01:58:38.470 --> 01:58:38.480 align:start position:0%
the blow dry bars are charging versus
 
01:58:39.990 --> 01:58:40.000 align:start position:0%
what the full salons are charging for
 
01:58:42.390 --> 01:58:42.400 align:start position:0%
these services to figure that out um i'm
 
01:58:43.669 --> 01:58:43.679 align:start position:0%
not saying necessarily it would reduce
 
01:58:45.510 --> 01:58:45.520 align:start position:0%
the price it might you introduce more
 
01:58:45.520 --> 01:58:46.709 align:start position:0%
the price it might you introduce more
competition

01:58:46.709 --> 01:58:46.719 align:start position:0%
competition
 
01:58:46.719 --> 01:58:47.910 align:start position:0%
competition
but

01:58:47.910 --> 01:58:47.920 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:58:49.510 --> 01:58:49.520 align:start position:0%
the bigger effect is that it's going to
 
01:58:52.229 --> 01:58:52.239 align:start position:0%
open up entrepreneurship and opportunity
 
01:58:53.510 --> 01:58:53.520 align:start position:0%
for people and that's what we're really
 
01:58:55.750 --> 01:58:55.760 align:start position:0%
going to want to focus on
 
01:58:55.760 --> 01:58:57.910 align:start position:0%
going to want to focus on
follow-up

01:58:57.910 --> 01:58:57.920 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
01:58:59.510 --> 01:58:59.520 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:59:01.830 --> 01:59:01.840 align:start position:0%
mr klein if the services are already
 
01:59:01.840 --> 01:59:03.750 align:start position:0%
mr klein if the services are already
available

01:59:03.750 --> 01:59:03.760 align:start position:0%
available
 
01:59:06.149 --> 01:59:06.159 align:start position:0%
at and establish i don't really i have
 
01:59:07.910 --> 01:59:07.920 align:start position:0%
to say i don't really understand your
 
01:59:11.109 --> 01:59:11.119 align:start position:0%
flurry of entrepreneurial activity
 
01:59:11.119 --> 01:59:12.390 align:start position:0%
flurry of entrepreneurial activity
because

01:59:12.390 --> 01:59:12.400 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:59:15.350 --> 01:59:15.360 align:start position:0%
there is an established market
 
01:59:17.589 --> 01:59:17.599 align:start position:0%
these products are available
 
01:59:19.910 --> 01:59:19.920 align:start position:0%
at businesses now
 
01:59:22.070 --> 01:59:22.080 align:start position:0%
and if there's an unknown price
 
01:59:22.080 --> 01:59:23.430 align:start position:0%
and if there's an unknown price
advantage

01:59:23.430 --> 01:59:23.440 align:start position:0%
advantage
 
01:59:24.790 --> 01:59:24.800 align:start position:0%
where would this flurry of
 
01:59:27.510 --> 01:59:27.520 align:start position:0%
entrepreneurial activity come from
 
01:59:29.430 --> 01:59:29.440 align:start position:0%
by merely removing the license is that
 
01:59:31.270 --> 01:59:31.280 align:start position:0%
what you're saying
 
01:59:34.950 --> 01:59:34.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:35.990 --> 01:59:36.000 align:start position:0%
there are two
 
01:59:37.669 --> 01:59:37.679 align:start position:0%
there are different types of services
 
01:59:39.109 --> 01:59:39.119 align:start position:0%
right so if you want to offer a full
 
01:59:41.669 --> 01:59:41.679 align:start position:0%
service salon you have to pay 20 000
 
01:59:44.310 --> 01:59:44.320 align:start position:0%
roughly for that cosmetology degree you
 
01:59:45.589 --> 01:59:45.599 align:start position:0%
have to go to school you have to get the
 
01:59:45.599 --> 01:59:47.189 align:start position:0%
have to go to school you have to get the
training

01:59:47.189 --> 01:59:47.199 align:start position:0%
training
 
01:59:49.189 --> 01:59:49.199 align:start position:0%
what this bill would do
 
01:59:52.149 --> 01:59:52.159 align:start position:0%
is say for this small subset of services
 
01:59:54.390 --> 01:59:54.400 align:start position:0%
these niche services that are defined in
 
01:59:55.990 --> 01:59:56.000 align:start position:0%
the bill shampooing conditioning
 
01:59:58.629 --> 01:59:58.639 align:start position:0%
arranging curling blow drying right
 
02:00:00.709 --> 02:00:00.719 align:start position:0%
you will not need a whole cosmetology
 
02:00:03.270 --> 02:00:03.280 align:start position:0%
license for that so what that will do
 
02:00:05.430 --> 02:00:05.440 align:start position:0%
is allow people to open more of these
 
02:00:07.910 --> 02:00:07.920 align:start position:0%
small niche salons
 
02:00:10.229 --> 02:00:10.239 align:start position:0%
i mean i just it's a it's a basic
 
02:00:12.629 --> 02:00:12.639 align:start position:0%
economic concept if you lower
 
02:00:15.030 --> 02:00:15.040 align:start position:0%
the cost of opening one of these salons
 
02:00:17.910 --> 02:00:17.920 align:start position:0%
you're going to get more of those salons
 
02:00:17.920 --> 02:00:18.950 align:start position:0%
you're going to get more of those salons
follow

02:00:18.950 --> 02:00:18.960 align:start position:0%
follow
 
02:00:21.669 --> 02:00:21.679 align:start position:0%
but you just told me a while back that
 
02:00:23.189 --> 02:00:23.199 align:start position:0%
you can't tell me
 
02:00:24.950 --> 02:00:24.960 align:start position:0%
that the price is going to be lower so
 
02:00:26.629 --> 02:00:26.639 align:start position:0%
you see we're going around and around
 
02:00:28.070 --> 02:00:28.080 align:start position:0%
and around you're saying okay the
 
02:00:29.990 --> 02:00:30.000 align:start position:0%
license is costing a lot of money and
 
02:00:32.070 --> 02:00:32.080 align:start position:0%
therefore people have to pay for that so
 
02:00:33.990 --> 02:00:34.000 align:start position:0%
this is going to open up this this
 
02:00:35.350 --> 02:00:35.360 align:start position:0%
market for people who don't have that
 
02:00:37.589 --> 02:00:37.599 align:start position:0%
license but i can't so it's going to be
 
02:00:39.189 --> 02:00:39.199 align:start position:0%
a lower cost but i can't tell you how
 
02:00:40.390 --> 02:00:40.400 align:start position:0%
much lower the cost would be or it's
 
02:00:41.910 --> 02:00:41.920 align:start position:0%
going to be you see you're true to
 
02:00:43.510 --> 02:00:43.520 align:start position:0%
chasing your tail here
 
02:00:45.109 --> 02:00:45.119 align:start position:0%
representative grota
 
02:00:47.109 --> 02:00:47.119 align:start position:0%
my interpretation nope nope my
 
02:00:48.550 --> 02:00:48.560 align:start position:0%
interpretation of what he's saying is
 
02:00:50.229 --> 02:00:50.239 align:start position:0%
it's not necessarily a lower cost of the
 
02:00:51.750 --> 02:00:51.760 align:start position:0%
consumer it's a lower cost for the
 
02:00:54.629 --> 02:00:54.639 align:start position:0%
establishment of the business by the
 
02:00:58.229 --> 02:00:58.239 align:start position:0%
folks that wish to perform the practice
 
02:00:59.910 --> 02:00:59.920 align:start position:0%
that's correct it may end up being a
 
02:01:01.910 --> 02:01:01.920 align:start position:0%
lower cost for the consumer i'm not able
 
02:01:03.350 --> 02:01:03.360 align:start position:0%
to predict that right now but what
 
02:01:05.510 --> 02:01:05.520 align:start position:0%
you're going to see is a lower cost to
 
02:01:07.750 --> 02:01:07.760 align:start position:0%
start the business of vastly lower cars
 
02:01:08.870 --> 02:01:08.880 align:start position:0%
to stock the business so you're going to
 
02:01:11.189 --> 02:01:11.199 align:start position:0%
see more of these businesses pop up
 
02:01:13.830 --> 02:01:13.840 align:start position:0%
theoretically you might see the costs
 
02:01:15.669 --> 02:01:15.679 align:start position:0%
come down for these washington blow dry
 
02:01:17.109 --> 02:01:17.119 align:start position:0%
services but i don't know that that'll
 
02:01:18.310 --> 02:01:18.320 align:start position:0%
be the case we don't know how many
 
02:01:20.229 --> 02:01:20.239 align:start position:0%
people are going to enter the field
 
02:01:24.790 --> 02:01:24.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:27.750 --> 02:01:27.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:29.430 --> 02:01:29.440 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
02:01:32.390 --> 02:01:32.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:35.430 --> 02:01:35.440 align:start position:0%
i'm hearing a lot about up and coming
 
02:01:39.589 --> 02:01:39.599 align:start position:0%
salons and blow dry salons and bars
 
02:01:42.390 --> 02:01:42.400 align:start position:0%
um there's so there must be
 
02:01:44.310 --> 02:01:44.320 align:start position:0%
some statistics out there as to the
 
02:01:46.390 --> 02:01:46.400 align:start position:0%
surrounding states that don't require
 
02:01:48.709 --> 02:01:48.719 align:start position:0%
the licensing of these facilities
 
02:01:50.229 --> 02:01:50.239 align:start position:0%
as to how many there are in
 
02:01:52.629 --> 02:01:52.639 align:start position:0%
massachusetts vermont and maine do you
 
02:01:55.350 --> 02:01:55.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:56.870 --> 02:01:56.880 align:start position:0%
so i
 
02:02:00.390 --> 02:02:00.400 align:start position:0%
the cosmetology license um i don't think
 
02:02:02.229 --> 02:02:02.239 align:start position:0%
the surrounding states have done have
 
02:02:04.470 --> 02:02:04.480 align:start position:0%
gone as far as this bill and separating
 
02:02:06.229 --> 02:02:06.239 align:start position:0%
that out so what the surrounding states
 
02:02:08.629 --> 02:02:08.639 align:start position:0%
do is they have the exemption for
 
02:02:10.950 --> 02:02:10.960 align:start position:0%
makeup demonstration and for theatrical
 
02:02:13.030 --> 02:02:13.040 align:start position:0%
production makeup application
 
02:02:14.790 --> 02:02:14.800 align:start position:0%
but to my knowledge they still require
 
02:02:16.390 --> 02:02:16.400 align:start position:0%
the full licensure
 
02:02:18.149 --> 02:02:18.159 align:start position:0%
for all of the services that are under
 
02:02:19.910 --> 02:02:19.920 align:start position:0%
here so the sponsor might know better
 
02:02:22.310 --> 02:02:22.320 align:start position:0%
than me but um i think that's the case
 
02:02:22.320 --> 02:02:23.430 align:start position:0%
than me but um i think that's the case
so

02:02:23.430 --> 02:02:23.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:02:25.669 --> 02:02:25.679 align:start position:0%
what we're saying with this bill is
 
02:02:27.990 --> 02:02:28.000 align:start position:0%
if you new hampshire would be
 
02:02:30.149 --> 02:02:30.159 align:start position:0%
leading the pack in this field by
 
02:02:32.229 --> 02:02:32.239 align:start position:0%
separating these things out these things
 
02:02:34.390 --> 02:02:34.400 align:start position:0%
that aren't necessary to have a full
 
02:02:38.310 --> 02:02:38.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:38.320 --> 02:02:40.310 align:start position:0%
 
follow-up

02:02:40.310 --> 02:02:40.320 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
02:02:41.990 --> 02:02:42.000 align:start position:0%
but i want to go back to your
 
02:02:43.910 --> 02:02:43.920 align:start position:0%
statement that these blow dry bars are
 
02:02:46.790 --> 02:02:46.800 align:start position:0%
new and up and coming and that because
 
02:02:48.390 --> 02:02:48.400 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire's law we only have two
 
02:02:49.990 --> 02:02:50.000 align:start position:0%
where they are up and coming in other
 
02:02:50.000 --> 02:02:51.990 align:start position:0%
where they are up and coming in other
states

02:02:51.990 --> 02:02:52.000 align:start position:0%
states
 
02:02:54.310 --> 02:02:54.320 align:start position:0%
and i want you to expand on that
 
02:02:55.510 --> 02:02:55.520 align:start position:0%
tell me how
 
02:02:58.229 --> 02:02:58.239 align:start position:0%
that data is confirmed and that this is
 
02:02:58.239 --> 02:03:00.229 align:start position:0%
that data is confirmed and that this is
factual

02:03:00.229 --> 02:03:00.239 align:start position:0%
factual
 
02:03:00.239 --> 02:03:01.270 align:start position:0%
factual
so

02:03:01.270 --> 02:03:01.280 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:03:03.910 --> 02:03:03.920 align:start position:0%
they're really popular in big states
 
02:03:06.950 --> 02:03:06.960 align:start position:0%
like florida new york and california
 
02:03:06.960 --> 02:03:07.669 align:start position:0%
like florida new york and california
so

02:03:07.669 --> 02:03:07.679 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:03:10.709 --> 02:03:10.719 align:start position:0%
it's a fashionable trend right and so
 
02:03:12.149 --> 02:03:12.159 align:start position:0%
those things lag
 
02:03:14.470 --> 02:03:14.480 align:start position:0%
by the time you get up to new hampshire
 
02:03:14.480 --> 02:03:15.750 align:start position:0%
by the time you get up to new hampshire
so

02:03:15.750 --> 02:03:15.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:03:17.669 --> 02:03:17.679 align:start position:0%
what we're seeing is there is some
 
02:03:19.030 --> 02:03:19.040 align:start position:0%
interest in new hampshire for opening
 
02:03:21.510 --> 02:03:21.520 align:start position:0%
these things but so far right now i did
 
02:03:22.870 --> 02:03:22.880 align:start position:0%
a google search for them and i found
 
02:03:24.790 --> 02:03:24.800 align:start position:0%
only two in new hampshire
 
02:03:26.870 --> 02:03:26.880 align:start position:0%
and what we're saying is
 
02:03:29.189 --> 02:03:29.199 align:start position:0%
to open one you probably you might see a
 
02:03:30.629 --> 02:03:30.639 align:start position:0%
few others open in new hampshire if we
 
02:03:33.270 --> 02:03:33.280 align:start position:0%
don't change this but if we do change it
 
02:03:34.790 --> 02:03:34.800 align:start position:0%
we're going to
 
02:03:36.709 --> 02:03:36.719 align:start position:0%
really open it up in new hampshire and
 
02:03:39.189 --> 02:03:39.199 align:start position:0%
make it much easier to open these types
 
02:03:40.870 --> 02:03:40.880 align:start position:0%
of businesses and serve the customers
 
02:03:46.310 --> 02:03:46.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:47.750 --> 02:03:47.760 align:start position:0%
mr klein i actually have a question for
 
02:03:49.109 --> 02:03:49.119 align:start position:0%
you in the
 
02:03:51.589 --> 02:03:51.599 align:start position:0%
in your search of these types of
 
02:03:53.830 --> 02:03:53.840 align:start position:0%
establishments in other areas
 
02:03:55.589 --> 02:03:55.599 align:start position:0%
what do they typically refer to
 
02:03:55.599 --> 02:03:56.390 align:start position:0%
what do they typically refer to
themselves

02:03:56.390 --> 02:03:56.400 align:start position:0%
themselves
 
02:03:56.400 --> 02:03:57.350 align:start position:0%
themselves
as

02:03:57.350 --> 02:03:57.360 align:start position:0%
as
 
02:04:00.790 --> 02:04:00.800 align:start position:0%
as far as do they call themselves
 
02:04:02.629 --> 02:04:02.639 align:start position:0%
names that are similar to what you would
 
02:04:04.069 --> 02:04:04.079 align:start position:0%
find in a place that offers full
 
02:04:04.079 --> 02:04:05.510 align:start position:0%
find in a place that offers full
cosmetology

02:04:05.510 --> 02:04:05.520 align:start position:0%
cosmetology
 
02:04:07.510 --> 02:04:07.520 align:start position:0%
uh no they call themselves dry bars or
 
02:04:09.990 --> 02:04:10.000 align:start position:0%
blow dry bars
 
02:04:11.510 --> 02:04:11.520 align:start position:0%
the name of the business in fact there's
 
02:04:12.550 --> 02:04:12.560 align:start position:0%
a chain
 
02:04:12.560 --> 02:04:13.350 align:start position:0%
a chain
um

02:04:13.350 --> 02:04:13.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:04:14.870 --> 02:04:14.880 align:start position:0%
that's growing nationally and i think it
 
02:04:18.870 --> 02:04:18.880 align:start position:0%
has the blow dry bars in its name but um
 
02:04:20.629 --> 02:04:20.639 align:start position:0%
they distinguish themselves on purpose
 
02:04:22.310 --> 02:04:22.320 align:start position:0%
from a regular salon they want the
 
02:04:23.910 --> 02:04:23.920 align:start position:0%
customer to know before going in that
 
02:04:27.109 --> 02:04:27.119 align:start position:0%
they only offer limited services
 
02:04:28.790 --> 02:04:28.800 align:start position:0%
so none of these facil none of these
 
02:04:28.800 --> 02:04:30.470 align:start position:0%
so none of these facil none of these
establishments

02:04:30.470 --> 02:04:30.480 align:start position:0%
establishments
 
02:04:32.629 --> 02:04:32.639 align:start position:0%
call themselves salons in their in their
 
02:04:35.430 --> 02:04:35.440 align:start position:0%
titles that you've seen
 
02:04:36.790 --> 02:04:36.800 align:start position:0%
yeah i mean i i haven't seen every
 
02:04:39.109 --> 02:04:39.119 align:start position:0%
single one but um typically they call
 
02:04:40.709 --> 02:04:40.719 align:start position:0%
themselves either blow dry bar or dry
 
02:04:40.719 --> 02:04:46.069 align:start position:0%
themselves either blow dry bar or dry
bar

02:04:46.069 --> 02:04:46.079 align:start position:0%

i'm the co-sponsor of this bill for

several reasons one i moved to new

several reasons one i moved to new
hampshire

02:06:00.629 --> 02:06:00.639 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
02:06:02.950 --> 02:06:02.960 align:start position:0%
however when i moved here i did have a
 
02:06:05.030 --> 02:06:05.040 align:start position:0%
manager's license for cosmetology that
 
02:06:06.870 --> 02:06:06.880 align:start position:0%
unfortunately was no longer valid the
 
02:06:08.229 --> 02:06:08.239 align:start position:0%
reasons for that
 
02:06:13.030 --> 02:06:13.040 align:start position:0%
was a lot of very unfortunate
 
02:06:13.040 --> 02:06:14.629 align:start position:0%
was a lot of very unfortunate
medical

02:06:14.629 --> 02:06:14.639 align:start position:0%
medical
 
02:06:16.470 --> 02:06:16.480 align:start position:0%
setbacks i had when i was pregnant with

my daughter
 
02:06:20.149 --> 02:06:20.159 align:start position:0%
which unfortunately prevented me from

being able to continue working in the

02:06:25.990 --> 02:06:26.000 align:start position:0%
when i moved here however i did not lose
 
02:06:28.310 --> 02:06:28.320 align:start position:0%
the skill that i had maintained that i
 
02:06:30.470 --> 02:06:30.480 align:start position:0%
had retained and honed while i was
 
02:06:32.550 --> 02:06:32.560 align:start position:0%
working in pennsylvania so let's say
 
02:06:34.149 --> 02:06:34.159 align:start position:0%
that i move here
 
02:06:36.069 --> 02:06:36.079 align:start position:0%
and the next bill that we are going to
 
02:06:37.830 --> 02:06:37.840 align:start position:0%
hear talks about the responsibility
 
02:06:40.229 --> 02:06:40.239 align:start position:0%
license or the requirements however it's
 
02:06:42.310 --> 02:06:42.320 align:start position:0%
not necessarily easy just to transfer
 
02:06:44.470 --> 02:06:44.480 align:start position:0%
your license so
 
02:06:47.830 --> 02:06:47.840 align:start position:0%
having the skill that i had
 
02:06:50.629 --> 02:06:50.639 align:start position:0%
i would say if i wanted to open up a dry
 
02:06:53.990 --> 02:06:54.000 align:start position:0%
bar and i was not doing any chemical
 
02:06:57.990 --> 02:06:58.000 align:start position:0%
services i'm not coloring anybody's hair
 
02:07:01.030 --> 02:07:01.040 align:start position:0%
i am not perming anybody's hair i am
 
02:07:01.040 --> 02:07:02.069 align:start position:0%
i am not perming anybody's hair i am
simply

02:07:02.069 --> 02:07:02.079 align:start position:0%
simply
 
02:07:02.079 --> 02:07:03.270 align:start position:0%
simply
offering

02:07:03.270 --> 02:07:03.280 align:start position:0%
offering
 
02:07:05.589 --> 02:07:05.599 align:start position:0%
beauty type services which you can walk
 
02:07:08.390 --> 02:07:08.400 align:start position:0%
into ulta and have done they often have
 
02:07:12.229 --> 02:07:12.239 align:start position:0%
coupons for non-chemical services right
 
02:07:14.310 --> 02:07:14.320 align:start position:0%
so that would have allowed me to move
 
02:07:16.149 --> 02:07:16.159 align:start position:0%
here be able to
 
02:07:18.870 --> 02:07:18.880 align:start position:0%
open up a business be able to give back
 
02:07:21.270 --> 02:07:21.280 align:start position:0%
to my community bring some funds into
 
02:07:23.030 --> 02:07:23.040 align:start position:0%
the state and help people feel better
 
02:07:24.470 --> 02:07:24.480 align:start position:0%
about themselves
 
02:07:26.950 --> 02:07:26.960 align:start position:0%
i would say it's pretty safe it's a
 
02:07:28.870 --> 02:07:28.880 align:start position:0%
pretty safe assumption
 
02:07:30.470 --> 02:07:30.480 align:start position:0%
that there are probably several people
 
02:07:31.910 --> 02:07:31.920 align:start position:0%
that are sitting behind me that are
 
02:07:34.470 --> 02:07:34.480 align:start position:0%
either enrolled in cosmetology school or
 
02:07:36.069 --> 02:07:36.079 align:start position:0%
recently finished
 
02:07:37.910 --> 02:07:37.920 align:start position:0%
that if they feel that they have the
 
02:07:37.920 --> 02:07:39.109 align:start position:0%
that if they feel that they have the
skill

02:07:39.109 --> 02:07:39.119 align:start position:0%
skill
 
02:07:40.870 --> 02:07:40.880 align:start position:0%
that it takes to do some of these
 
02:07:42.790 --> 02:07:42.800 align:start position:0%
services and they don't have to pay
 
02:07:45.350 --> 02:07:45.360 align:start position:0%
upwards of twenty five thousand dollars
 
02:07:47.109 --> 02:07:47.119 align:start position:0%
in order to do that
 
02:07:48.470 --> 02:07:48.480 align:start position:0%
let them
 
02:07:51.750 --> 02:07:51.760 align:start position:0%
it's their reputation on the line
 
02:07:53.750 --> 02:07:53.760 align:start position:0%
it's their financials that are on the
 
02:07:53.760 --> 02:07:54.470 align:start position:0%
it's their financials that are on the
line

02:07:54.470 --> 02:07:54.480 align:start position:0%
line
 
02:07:56.149 --> 02:07:56.159 align:start position:0%
it's their livelihoods that are on the
 
02:07:56.159 --> 02:07:57.430 align:start position:0%
it's their livelihoods that are on the
line

02:07:57.430 --> 02:07:57.440 align:start position:0%
line
 
02:07:58.870 --> 02:07:58.880 align:start position:0%
whether or not they're going to testify
 
02:08:01.109 --> 02:08:01.119 align:start position:0%
to that i don't know but i'm willing to
 
02:08:03.109 --> 02:08:03.119 align:start position:0%
bet that there are several people out
 
02:08:05.030 --> 02:08:05.040 align:start position:0%
there that parents might say
 
02:08:06.950 --> 02:08:06.960 align:start position:0%
instead of twenty five thousand dollars
 
02:08:09.030 --> 02:08:09.040 align:start position:0%
for this particular education i'm going
 
02:08:11.750 --> 02:08:11.760 align:start position:0%
to invest in you opening up this dry bar
 
02:08:13.990 --> 02:08:14.000 align:start position:0%
and see how it goes the fact of the
 
02:08:16.790 --> 02:08:16.800 align:start position:0%
matter is things evolve over time that's
 
02:08:19.109 --> 02:08:19.119 align:start position:0%
why we have policies for online media
 
02:08:21.189 --> 02:08:21.199 align:start position:0%
right things change things aren't like
 
02:08:22.470 --> 02:08:22.480 align:start position:0%
they were
 
02:08:24.870 --> 02:08:24.880 align:start position:0%
then this is why all of these
 
02:08:27.350 --> 02:08:27.360 align:start position:0%
beauties like alta offers beauty
 
02:08:30.470 --> 02:08:30.480 align:start position:0%
services jcpenney offers beauty services
 
02:08:33.430 --> 02:08:33.440 align:start position:0%

02:08:36.390 --> 02:08:36.400 align:start position:0%

respect to what the representatives say
 
02:08:44.310 --> 02:08:44.320 align:start position:0%
said having to perform a service to have
 
02:08:45.990 --> 02:08:46.000 align:start position:0%
that taken care of that's very
 
02:08:47.830 --> 02:08:47.840 align:start position:0%
unfortunate but i would have to say if
 
02:08:49.669 --> 02:08:49.679 align:start position:0%
that was a child that did that that was
 
02:08:51.910 --> 02:08:51.920 align:start position:0%
the parent's fault
 
02:08:55.430 --> 02:08:55.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:56.709 --> 02:08:56.719 align:start position:0%
does anyone have any questions for
 
02:08:59.750 --> 02:08:59.760 align:start position:0%

state cosmetology licensing fails

aspiring beauty workers which details
 
02:10:07.830 --> 02:10:07.840 align:start position:0%
how state-mandated cosmetology programs
 
02:10:09.430 --> 02:10:09.440 align:start position:0%
are roadblocks rather than stepping
 
02:10:12.310 --> 02:10:12.320 align:start position:0%
stones for these professionals
 
02:10:14.069 --> 02:10:14.079 align:start position:0%
new hampshire is ripe with opportunity
 
02:10:16.629 --> 02:10:16.639 align:start position:0%
for beauty professionals but current
 
02:10:19.350 --> 02:10:19.360 align:start position:0%
licensing laws shut people out of jobs
 
02:10:21.109 --> 02:10:21.119 align:start position:0%
new hampshire requires bd professionals
 
02:10:23.430 --> 02:10:23.440 align:start position:0%
to have one of the three big licenses
 
02:10:25.350 --> 02:10:25.360 align:start position:0%
which i think you all are familiar with
 
02:10:28.069 --> 02:10:28.079 align:start position:0%
the cosmetology barber barber's license
 
02:10:29.589 --> 02:10:29.599 align:start position:0%
the manicurist license or an
 
02:10:31.430 --> 02:10:31.440 align:start position:0%
esthetician's license
 
02:10:33.510 --> 02:10:33.520 align:start position:0%
grouping all beauty services into one of
 
02:10:35.669 --> 02:10:35.679 align:start position:0%
these three overbroad licenses does not
 
02:10:37.350 --> 02:10:37.360 align:start position:0%
work for an industry that is based on
 
02:10:39.750 --> 02:10:39.760 align:start position:0%
creativity and evolving techniques
 
02:10:41.750 --> 02:10:41.760 align:start position:0%
outdated licensing requirements also
 
02:10:43.270 --> 02:10:43.280 align:start position:0%
force beauty professionals into
 
02:10:45.430 --> 02:10:45.440 align:start position:0%
time-consuming and costly traditional
 
02:10:47.990 --> 02:10:48.000 align:start position:0%
cosmetology programs even though those
 
02:10:49.910 --> 02:10:49.920 align:start position:0%
programs do not teach services that
 
02:10:51.830 --> 02:10:51.840 align:start position:0%
these aspiring professionals would like
 
02:10:53.589 --> 02:10:53.599 align:start position:0%
to offer
 
02:10:55.910 --> 02:10:55.920 align:start position:0%
traditional cosmetology licensing laws
 
02:10:57.910 --> 02:10:57.920 align:start position:0%
prevent niche beauty professionals from
 
02:10:59.910 --> 02:10:59.920 align:start position:0%
entering the industry
 
02:11:01.589 --> 02:11:01.599 align:start position:0%
as you all have heard today the beauty
 
02:11:03.910 --> 02:11:03.920 align:start position:0%
services in this bill include blow dry
 
02:11:06.790 --> 02:11:06.800 align:start position:0%
styling eyelash extension application
 
02:11:09.030 --> 02:11:09.040 align:start position:0%
makeup application and threading
 
02:11:10.470 --> 02:11:10.480 align:start position:0%
these services are different from the
 
02:11:12.550 --> 02:11:12.560 align:start position:0%
big three licenses because they do not
 
02:11:15.830 --> 02:11:15.840 align:start position:0%
use dangerous tools chemicals or dyes
 
02:11:17.189 --> 02:11:17.199 align:start position:0%
they are limited in their scope of
 
02:11:19.510 --> 02:11:19.520 align:start position:0%
practice and niche beauty professionals
 
02:11:21.750 --> 02:11:21.760 align:start position:0%
train outside of cosmetology programs
 
02:11:22.870 --> 02:11:22.880 align:start position:0%
through methods like private
 
02:11:26.790 --> 02:11:26.800 align:start position:0%
certification and cultural exchange
 
02:11:28.950 --> 02:11:28.960 align:start position:0%
most traditional cosmetology programs do
 
02:11:31.109 --> 02:11:31.119 align:start position:0%
not teach beauties or do not teach niche
 
02:11:33.270 --> 02:11:33.280 align:start position:0%
beauty services and if they do it's at a
 
02:11:35.270 --> 02:11:35.280 align:start position:0%
very rudimentary level
 
02:11:36.950 --> 02:11:36.960 align:start position:0%
even so aspiring niche beauty
 
02:11:38.149 --> 02:11:38.159 align:start position:0%
professionals must complete the
 
02:11:39.990 --> 02:11:40.000 align:start position:0%
traditional cosmetology program as a
 
02:11:41.830 --> 02:11:41.840 align:start position:0%
requirement to licensure to provide
 
02:11:43.669 --> 02:11:43.679 align:start position:0%
these services
 
02:11:45.750 --> 02:11:45.760 align:start position:0%
the average student in new hampshire
 
02:11:48.149 --> 02:11:48.159 align:start position:0%
takes out so you all have heard nineteen
 
02:11:49.910 --> 02:11:49.920 align:start position:0%
thousand twenty thousand for overall
 
02:11:53.270 --> 02:11:53.280 align:start position:0%
cosmetology school but 7 300
 
02:11:55.510 --> 02:11:55.520 align:start position:0%
of federal student loan debt to complete
 
02:11:57.990 --> 02:11:58.000 align:start position:0%
their first program and most students do
 
02:11:59.750 --> 02:11:59.760 align:start position:0%
not graduate on time
 
02:12:03.910 --> 02:12:03.920 align:start position:0%
in 2016 and 2017 only about 19 percent
 
02:12:05.910 --> 02:12:05.920 align:start position:0%
of cosmetology students graduated on
 
02:12:05.920 --> 02:12:06.950 align:start position:0%
of cosmetology students graduated on
time

02:12:06.950 --> 02:12:06.960 align:start position:0%
time
 
02:12:08.950 --> 02:12:08.960 align:start position:0%
their peers were forced to incur even
 
02:12:11.910 --> 02:12:11.920 align:start position:0%
more debt to finish their training and
 
02:12:13.910 --> 02:12:13.920 align:start position:0%
more time to finish that training
 
02:12:15.750 --> 02:12:15.760 align:start position:0%
the result being that many niche beauty
 
02:12:17.109 --> 02:12:17.119 align:start position:0%
professionals work in underground
 
02:12:19.430 --> 02:12:19.440 align:start position:0%
economies where they where they face
 
02:12:21.830 --> 02:12:21.840 align:start position:0%
exploitation or they continue to incur
 
02:12:23.589 --> 02:12:23.599 align:start position:0%
insurmountable debt that also raises
 
02:12:25.589 --> 02:12:25.599 align:start position:0%
costs for consumers without giving those
 
02:12:27.990 --> 02:12:28.000 align:start position:0%
consumers any additional benefits
 
02:12:30.229 --> 02:12:30.239 align:start position:0%
house bill 1171 is a solution for
 
02:12:32.069 --> 02:12:32.079 align:start position:0%
aspiring beauty professionals based off
 
02:12:34.069 --> 02:12:34.079 align:start position:0%
of proven methods of reform that have
 
02:12:36.310 --> 02:12:36.320 align:start position:0%
created job opportunities
 
02:12:37.990 --> 02:12:38.000 align:start position:0%
i encourage this committee to support
 
02:12:41.189 --> 02:12:41.199 align:start position:0%
house bill 1171 for three reasons
 
02:12:43.510 --> 02:12:43.520 align:start position:0%
first niche beauty services are safe
 
02:12:45.430 --> 02:12:45.440 align:start position:0%
blow dry styling eyelash extension
 
02:12:47.270 --> 02:12:47.280 align:start position:0%
application makeup application and
 
02:12:50.149 --> 02:12:50.159 align:start position:0%
threading pose virtually no risk to
 
02:12:50.159 --> 02:12:51.350 align:start position:0%
threading pose virtually no risk to
consumers

02:12:51.350 --> 02:12:51.360 align:start position:0%
consumers
 
02:12:53.030 --> 02:12:53.040 align:start position:0%
nationwide there have been very few
 
02:12:55.109 --> 02:12:55.119 align:start position:0%
complaints filed with state boards of
 
02:12:56.790 --> 02:12:56.800 align:start position:0%
cosmetology about health and safety
 
02:12:59.350 --> 02:12:59.360 align:start position:0%
issues related to niche beauty services
 
02:13:01.109 --> 02:13:01.119 align:start position:0%
when complaints are made they are
 
02:13:03.030 --> 02:13:03.040 align:start position:0%
typically about the service provider's
 
02:13:05.350 --> 02:13:05.360 align:start position:0%
licensure rather than health and safety
 
02:13:05.360 --> 02:13:06.870 align:start position:0%
licensure rather than health and safety
concerns

02:13:06.870 --> 02:13:06.880 align:start position:0%
concerns
 
02:13:08.950 --> 02:13:08.960 align:start position:0%
second most states already exempt niche
 
02:13:10.229 --> 02:13:10.239 align:start position:0%
beauty services from license
 
02:13:12.149 --> 02:13:12.159 align:start position:0%
requirements as you're all familiar with
 
02:13:13.510 --> 02:13:13.520 align:start position:0%
and you've heard
 
02:13:14.950 --> 02:13:14.960 align:start position:0%
new hampshire exempts hair braiding
 
02:13:16.629 --> 02:13:16.639 align:start position:0%
which is a form of
 
02:13:18.390 --> 02:13:18.400 align:start position:0%
hair styling from
 
02:13:21.189 --> 02:13:21.199 align:start position:0%
from cosmetology requirements
 
02:13:22.950 --> 02:13:22.960 align:start position:0%
over a dozen states exempt shampooing
 
02:13:24.790 --> 02:13:24.800 align:start position:0%
from licensure requirements
 
02:13:27.430 --> 02:13:27.440 align:start position:0%
five states exempt fully exempt blow dry
 
02:13:29.589 --> 02:13:29.599 align:start position:0%
styling licensing requirements
 
02:13:32.149 --> 02:13:32.159 align:start position:0%
10 states exempt makeup application from
 
02:13:34.310 --> 02:13:34.320 align:start position:0%
cosmetology or esthetician licensing
 
02:13:36.870 --> 02:13:36.880 align:start position:0%
requirements and most states also exempt
 
02:13:39.109 --> 02:13:39.119 align:start position:0%
as as you've heard have exemptions for
 
02:13:42.069 --> 02:13:42.079 align:start position:0%
theater television movie and radio
 
02:13:44.470 --> 02:13:44.480 align:start position:0%
and modeling purposes or makeup counter
 
02:13:44.480 --> 02:13:46.149 align:start position:0%
and modeling purposes or makeup counter
demonstrations

02:13:46.149 --> 02:13:46.159 align:start position:0%
demonstrations
 
02:13:48.149 --> 02:13:48.159 align:start position:0%
seven states exempt eyelash extension
 
02:13:49.350 --> 02:13:49.360 align:start position:0%
professionals from licensing
 
02:13:51.830 --> 02:13:51.840 align:start position:0%
requirements and finally 13 states
 
02:13:53.669 --> 02:13:53.679 align:start position:0%
exempt threaters from cosmetology and
 
02:13:56.470 --> 02:13:56.480 align:start position:0%
aesthetics licensing requirements
 
02:13:58.229 --> 02:13:58.239 align:start position:0%
in several states threading also falls
 
02:14:00.870 --> 02:14:00.880 align:start position:0%
into a regulatory gray area so the
 
02:14:02.870 --> 02:14:02.880 align:start position:0%
number of states that do not require
 
02:14:04.470 --> 02:14:04.480 align:start position:0%
threaders to be licensed is actually
 
02:14:05.910 --> 02:14:05.920 align:start position:0%
greater than the states with full
 
02:14:05.920 --> 02:14:07.910 align:start position:0%
greater than the states with full
exemptions

02:14:07.910 --> 02:14:07.920 align:start position:0%
exemptions
 
02:14:11.510 --> 02:14:11.520 align:start position:0%
third house bill 1171 is a jobs bill
 
02:14:13.189 --> 02:14:13.199 align:start position:0%
last year nearly half of american
 
02:14:15.750 --> 02:14:15.760 align:start position:0%
companies reported labor shortages it's
 
02:14:17.589 --> 02:14:17.599 align:start position:0%
time to take common sense and proven
 
02:14:19.350 --> 02:14:19.360 align:start position:0%
measures to reduce known barriers to
 
02:14:19.360 --> 02:14:20.310 align:start position:0%
measures to reduce known barriers to
entry

02:14:20.310 --> 02:14:20.320 align:start position:0%
entry
 
02:14:22.629 --> 02:14:22.639 align:start position:0%
reducing licensing barriers for for
 
02:14:24.550 --> 02:14:24.560 align:start position:0%
aspiring beauty professionals does just
 
02:14:24.560 --> 02:14:25.350 align:start position:0%
aspiring beauty professionals does just
that

02:14:25.350 --> 02:14:25.360 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:14:27.430 --> 02:14:27.440 align:start position:0%
for example after minnesota passed its
 
02:14:29.189 --> 02:14:29.199 align:start position:0%
freelance hair and makeup licensing
 
02:14:32.149 --> 02:14:32.159 align:start position:0%
reform there were nearly 1 000 bridal
 
02:14:34.310 --> 02:14:34.320 align:start position:0%
hair and makeup artists who were free to
 
02:14:36.229 --> 02:14:36.239 align:start position:0%
legitimately work without fear of
 
02:14:36.239 --> 02:14:37.510 align:start position:0%
legitimately work without fear of
enforcement

02:14:37.510 --> 02:14:37.520 align:start position:0%
enforcement
 
02:14:40.149 --> 02:14:40.159 align:start position:0%
additionally house bill 1171 mostly
 
02:14:42.069 --> 02:14:42.079 align:start position:0%
benefits lower to middle income women
 
02:14:43.830 --> 02:14:43.840 align:start position:0%
who do not have the time or money or
 
02:14:45.430 --> 02:14:45.440 align:start position:0%
resources to attend a traditional
 
02:14:47.750 --> 02:14:47.760 align:start position:0%
cosmetology program but they have the
 
02:14:49.350 --> 02:14:49.360 align:start position:0%
training to provide those in-demand
 
02:14:49.360 --> 02:14:50.790 align:start position:0%
training to provide those in-demand
services

02:14:50.790 --> 02:14:50.800 align:start position:0%
services
 
02:14:52.790 --> 02:14:52.800 align:start position:0%
finally this bill allows citizens across
 
02:14:54.149 --> 02:14:54.159 align:start position:0%
the state to benefit from the wealth of
 
02:14:55.990 --> 02:14:56.000 align:start position:0%
new talent and techniques that are
 
02:14:57.830 --> 02:14:57.840 align:start position:0%
currently difficult to find in
 
02:14:59.830 --> 02:14:59.840 align:start position:0%
conclusion i encourage this committee to
 
02:15:02.470 --> 02:15:02.480 align:start position:0%
support house bill 1171 so that aspiring
 
02:15:04.390 --> 02:15:04.400 align:start position:0%
beauty workers have every opportunity to
 
02:15:06.149 --> 02:15:06.159 align:start position:0%

i'll be briefed i i don't want to be
 
02:16:27.119 --> 02:16:28.390 align:start position:0%
i'll be briefed i i don't want to be
repetitive

02:16:28.390 --> 02:16:28.400 align:start position:0%
repetitive
 
02:16:30.470 --> 02:16:30.480 align:start position:0%
in respect of the committee's time
 
02:16:32.150 --> 02:16:32.160 align:start position:0%
but as we've heard this bill creates an
 
02:16:32.160 --> 02:16:33.270 align:start position:0%
but as we've heard this bill creates an
exemption

02:16:33.270 --> 02:16:33.280 align:start position:0%
exemption
 
02:16:35.830 --> 02:16:35.840 align:start position:0%
uh for the cosmetology license uh for
 
02:16:39.270 --> 02:16:39.280 align:start position:0%
the uh for styling hair threading makeup
 
02:16:39.280 --> 02:16:40.549 align:start position:0%
the uh for styling hair threading makeup
application

02:16:40.549 --> 02:16:40.559 align:start position:0%
application
 
02:16:43.190 --> 02:16:43.200 align:start position:0%
and eyelash extension application
 
02:16:45.030 --> 02:16:45.040 align:start position:0%
all of these services are very low risk
 
02:16:46.469 --> 02:16:46.479 align:start position:0%
to the consumer
 
02:16:48.790 --> 02:16:48.800 align:start position:0%
since they do not involve cutting hair
 
02:16:51.190 --> 02:16:51.200 align:start position:0%
coloring hair or chemically altering
 
02:16:52.709 --> 02:16:52.719 align:start position:0%
hair in any way
 
02:16:52.719 --> 02:16:53.910 align:start position:0%
hair in any way
currently

02:16:53.910 --> 02:16:53.920 align:start position:0%
currently
 
02:16:55.509 --> 02:16:55.519 align:start position:0%
granite staters that are wishing to open
 
02:16:57.669 --> 02:16:57.679 align:start position:0%
what's called a blow bar
 
02:16:59.349 --> 02:16:59.359 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire would be required to go
 
02:17:01.509 --> 02:17:01.519 align:start position:0%
through the same requirements as those
 
02:17:05.349 --> 02:17:05.359 align:start position:0%
looking to open a salon or a barber shop
 
02:17:07.910 --> 02:17:07.920 align:start position:0%
even though they only offer a very small
 
02:17:07.920 --> 02:17:08.950 align:start position:0%
even though they only offer a very small
fraction

02:17:08.950 --> 02:17:08.960 align:start position:0%
fraction
 
02:17:11.030 --> 02:17:11.040 align:start position:0%
of those services and the least
 
02:17:13.910 --> 02:17:13.920 align:start position:0%
complicated of those services uh this
 
02:17:16.309 --> 02:17:16.319 align:start position:0%
bill would simply recognize that this
 
02:17:19.030 --> 02:17:19.040 align:start position:0%
growing trend uh in cosmetology
 
02:17:21.429 --> 02:17:21.439 align:start position:0%
obviously does not pose the same
 
02:17:24.870 --> 02:17:24.880 align:start position:0%
level of of of uh threat to the consumer
 
02:17:26.790 --> 02:17:26.800 align:start position:0%
or risk to the consumer
 
02:17:28.309 --> 02:17:28.319 align:start position:0%
and they do not provide the same level
 
02:17:30.790 --> 02:17:30.800 align:start position:0%
of services and therefore should not
 
02:17:32.629 --> 02:17:32.639 align:start position:0%
have the same burden
 
02:17:34.070 --> 02:17:34.080 align:start position:0%
of licensure
 
02:17:36.389 --> 02:17:36.399 align:start position:0%
especially when those as i mentioned
 
02:17:38.709 --> 02:17:38.719 align:start position:0%
those services do not pose a significant
 
02:17:41.349 --> 02:17:41.359 align:start position:0%
risk to the public
 
02:17:43.270 --> 02:17:43.280 align:start position:0%
even when it comes to to eyelash
 
02:17:46.389 --> 02:17:46.399 align:start position:0%
extensions as we've heard uh this
 
02:17:48.629 --> 02:17:48.639 align:start position:0%
process is the uh an adhesive is
 
02:17:50.629 --> 02:17:50.639 align:start position:0%
pre-applied uh
 
02:17:52.950 --> 02:17:52.960 align:start position:0%
and then the the uh obviously i'm no
 
02:17:55.589 --> 02:17:55.599 align:start position:0%
expert in this i'll make that joke but i
 
02:17:59.110 --> 02:17:59.120 align:start position:0%
i think uh when it comes to to that it
 
02:18:01.509 --> 02:18:01.519 align:start position:0%
is not actually taught in the school
 
02:18:01.519 --> 02:18:02.230 align:start position:0%
is not actually taught in the school
that's

02:18:02.230 --> 02:18:02.240 align:start position:0%
that's
 
02:18:04.549 --> 02:18:04.559 align:start position:0%
that's required to get the license so if
 
02:18:06.950 --> 02:18:06.960 align:start position:0%
you're getting training uh you're
 
02:18:09.030 --> 02:18:09.040 align:start position:0%
requiring training to get a license for
 
02:18:12.230 --> 02:18:12.240 align:start position:0%
a procedure that when you uh do acquire
 
02:18:14.150 --> 02:18:14.160 align:start position:0%
that license and you you graduate from
 
02:18:15.830 --> 02:18:15.840 align:start position:0%
the training and you've completed all
 
02:18:17.830 --> 02:18:17.840 align:start position:0%
the steps you've received no training in
 
02:18:19.190 --> 02:18:19.200 align:start position:0%
the procedure that you're looking to
 
02:18:19.200 --> 02:18:20.469 align:start position:0%
the procedure that you're looking to
provide

02:18:20.469 --> 02:18:20.479 align:start position:0%
provide
 
02:18:22.870 --> 02:18:22.880 align:start position:0%
obviously that's that's uh ridiculous
 
02:18:25.910 --> 02:18:25.920 align:start position:0%
and unnecessary and and we should uh
 
02:18:27.990 --> 02:18:28.000 align:start position:0%
look at passing this bill to exempt
 
02:18:31.270 --> 02:18:31.280 align:start position:0%
those services in those very specific uh
 
02:18:34.070 --> 02:18:34.080 align:start position:0%
areas of cosmetology
 
02:18:34.080 --> 02:18:35.750 align:start position:0%
areas of cosmetology
um

02:18:35.750 --> 02:18:35.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:18:38.070 --> 02:18:38.080 align:start position:0%
these were the same reasons by the way i
 
02:18:39.750 --> 02:18:39.760 align:start position:0%
i see some some committee members that
 
02:18:41.830 --> 02:18:41.840 align:start position:0%
have been around for for quite some time
 
02:18:44.469 --> 02:18:44.479 align:start position:0%
these were the same reasons that uh
 
02:18:46.389 --> 02:18:46.399 align:start position:0%
that we exempted the hair braiding
 
02:18:48.870 --> 02:18:48.880 align:start position:0%
license from cosmetology
 
02:18:51.750 --> 02:18:51.760 align:start position:0%
back in 2017. it posed very little
 
02:18:53.990 --> 02:18:54.000 align:start position:0%
threat to the public very little risk
 
02:18:56.709 --> 02:18:56.719 align:start position:0%
and it allowed really low income
 
02:18:59.270 --> 02:18:59.280 align:start position:0%
uh folks who may have been operating in
 
02:19:01.669 --> 02:19:01.679 align:start position:0%
black markets to come out into the light
 
02:19:04.230 --> 02:19:04.240 align:start position:0%
start a business create an industry i
 
02:19:06.389 --> 02:19:06.399 align:start position:0%
can tell you uh just from from the hair
 
02:19:10.150 --> 02:19:10.160 align:start position:0%
braiding license from 2017 a a a
 
02:19:12.389 --> 02:19:12.399 align:start position:0%
woman by the name of sarah d'actor who's
 
02:19:16.230 --> 02:19:16.240 align:start position:0%
a refugee in manchester uh was operating
 
02:19:18.549 --> 02:19:18.559 align:start position:0%
uh in a gray area of the law beforehand
 
02:19:20.469 --> 02:19:20.479 align:start position:0%
she now has a very successful shop in
 
02:19:22.950 --> 02:19:22.960 align:start position:0%
manchester and has been able to to
 
02:19:24.549 --> 02:19:24.559 align:start position:0%
provide their her kids to go into
 
02:19:26.230 --> 02:19:26.240 align:start position:0%
private school she was able to move to
 
02:19:29.270 --> 02:19:29.280 align:start position:0%
bedford really provide a a great thing
 
02:19:30.950 --> 02:19:30.960 align:start position:0%
for her community so those are the the
 
02:19:33.110 --> 02:19:33.120 align:start position:0%
folks that we're looking
 
02:19:35.190 --> 02:19:35.200 align:start position:0%
to address with this niche beauty bill
 
02:19:37.509 --> 02:19:37.519 align:start position:0%
is allowing them to to come out into the
 
02:19:40.070 --> 02:19:40.080 align:start position:0%
open uh invest in their community and
 
02:19:42.150 --> 02:19:42.160 align:start position:0%
and have this business uh so for those
 
02:19:44.790 --> 02:19:44.800 align:start position:0%
reasons we urge the committee to move hb
 
02:19:47.110 --> 02:19:47.120 align:start position:0%
1171 ought to pass
 
02:19:48.070 --> 02:19:48.080 align:start position:0%

about our clinics the reason we do have
 
02:21:31.910 --> 02:21:31.920 align:start position:0%

have graduated a lot of successful
 
02:21:50.870 --> 02:21:50.880 align:start position:0%
students so
 
02:21:52.950 --> 02:21:52.960 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm a big believer before i came to

salons from boston all the way up to
 
02:22:02.790 --> 02:22:02.800 align:start position:0%
north conway and i got to witness a lot
 
02:22:03.830 --> 02:22:03.840 align:start position:0%
of the things we're talking about
 
02:22:05.590 --> 02:22:05.600 align:start position:0%
firsthand some of the
 
02:22:08.070 --> 02:22:08.080 align:start position:0%
dangers in this industry and i know it's
 
02:22:09.750 --> 02:22:09.760 align:start position:0%
they're not using um bleach and
 
02:22:12.230 --> 02:22:12.240 align:start position:0%
chemicals chemicals to do
 
02:22:12.240 --> 02:22:13.190 align:start position:0%
chemicals chemicals to do
um

02:22:13.190 --> 02:22:13.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:22:15.110 --> 02:22:15.120 align:start position:0%
shampoos and blow drys
 
02:22:15.120 --> 02:22:15.990 align:start position:0%
shampoos and blow drys
but

02:22:15.990 --> 02:22:16.000 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:22:17.590 --> 02:22:17.600 align:start position:0%
sanitation is a big part of our
 
02:22:17.600 --> 02:22:19.110 align:start position:0%
sanitation is a big part of our
education

02:22:19.110 --> 02:22:19.120 align:start position:0%
education
 
02:22:20.469 --> 02:22:20.479 align:start position:0%
so i just want to read a few things i
 
02:22:22.469 --> 02:22:22.479 align:start position:0%
was thinking about when in talking to
 
02:22:25.030 --> 02:22:25.040 align:start position:0%
you fine people licensure requirements
 
02:22:26.469 --> 02:22:26.479 align:start position:0%
are in place for the public's protection
 
02:22:27.990 --> 02:22:28.000 align:start position:0%
that's number one
 
02:22:29.590 --> 02:22:29.600 align:start position:0%
requirements for licensure include
 
02:22:31.110 --> 02:22:31.120 align:start position:0%
proper training in these services
 
02:22:32.950 --> 02:22:32.960 align:start position:0%
application removal
 
02:22:34.309 --> 02:22:34.319 align:start position:0%
product knowledge and how to handle
 
02:22:36.790 --> 02:22:36.800 align:start position:0%
negative reactions
 
02:22:38.389 --> 02:22:38.399 align:start position:0%
it is easy to spread infection if the
 
02:22:39.750 --> 02:22:39.760 align:start position:0%
person doing the service does not have
 
02:22:41.270 --> 02:22:41.280 align:start position:0%
the knowledge of infection control and
 
02:22:43.110 --> 02:22:43.120 align:start position:0%
sanitation procedures
 
02:22:45.030 --> 02:22:45.040 align:start position:0%
licensures ensures that the business
 
02:22:46.710 --> 02:22:46.720 align:start position:0%
performing these services are inspected
 
02:22:49.110 --> 02:22:49.120 align:start position:0%
in proper infection control procedures
 
02:22:50.870 --> 02:22:50.880 align:start position:0%
are followed
 
02:22:53.110 --> 02:22:53.120 align:start position:0%
public safety is the concern and during
 
02:22:55.590 --> 02:22:55.600 align:start position:0%
the covet pandemic cosmetology is one of
 
02:22:57.670 --> 02:22:57.680 align:start position:0%
the most regulated industries
 
02:22:59.030 --> 02:22:59.040 align:start position:0%
because of the concern for the public
 
02:23:00.630 --> 02:23:00.640 align:start position:0%
welfare as you remember on the news a
 
02:23:02.710 --> 02:23:02.720 align:start position:0%
lot of the newscasters were going gray
 
02:23:04.469 --> 02:23:04.479 align:start position:0%
and that was a major stress in a lot of
 
02:23:04.479 --> 02:23:05.349 align:start position:0%
and that was a major stress in a lot of
them

02:23:05.349 --> 02:23:05.359 align:start position:0%
them
 
02:23:07.349 --> 02:23:07.359 align:start position:0%
why are you why would we be lessening
 
02:23:09.830 --> 02:23:09.840 align:start position:0%
this now with covert going on
 
02:23:11.429 --> 02:23:11.439 align:start position:0%
licensure of the these procedures
 
02:23:13.510 --> 02:23:13.520 align:start position:0%
ensures the board is able to take action
 
02:23:15.510 --> 02:23:15.520 align:start position:0%
if harm to the client occurs
 
02:23:17.270 --> 02:23:17.280 align:start position:0%
disciplinary action can take place if
 
02:23:20.150 --> 02:23:20.160 align:start position:0%
there is a negligence if if it is buyer
 
02:23:21.990 --> 02:23:22.000 align:start position:0%
beware what is the recourse the person
 
02:23:23.750 --> 02:23:23.760 align:start position:0%
can continue to harm the public without
 
02:23:25.670 --> 02:23:25.680 align:start position:0%
any consequences
 
02:23:27.190 --> 02:23:27.200 align:start position:0%
and i heard one of the representatives
 
02:23:28.550 --> 02:23:28.560 align:start position:0%
talk about um
 
02:23:31.510 --> 02:23:31.520 align:start position:0%
jcpenney's and alta they are licensed in
 
02:23:33.429 --> 02:23:33.439 align:start position:0%
those locations as well
 
02:23:35.670 --> 02:23:35.680 align:start position:0%
and you know when talking about the 1500
 
02:23:38.070 --> 02:23:38.080 align:start position:0%
hours i ran salons in massachusetts and
 
02:23:40.230 --> 02:23:40.240 align:start position:0%
i can tell you the thousand hours they
 
02:23:41.830 --> 02:23:41.840 align:start position:0%
had was not
 
02:23:44.150 --> 02:23:44.160 align:start position:0%
was not enough because i could tell the
 
02:23:45.429 --> 02:23:45.439 align:start position:0%
difference from a new hampshire
 
02:23:47.590 --> 02:23:47.600 align:start position:0%
cosmetologist to a massachusetts
 
02:23:50.150 --> 02:23:50.160 align:start position:0%
cosmetologist and back then they had to
 
02:23:50.160 --> 02:23:50.950 align:start position:0%
cosmetologist and back then they had to
have

02:23:50.950 --> 02:23:50.960 align:start position:0%
have
 
02:23:53.510 --> 02:23:53.520 align:start position:0%
work under someone for x amount of time
 
02:23:55.590 --> 02:23:55.600 align:start position:0%
after they were licensed where in new
 
02:23:57.270 --> 02:23:57.280 align:start position:0%
hampshire they're ready to go on their
 
02:24:00.710 --> 02:24:00.720 align:start position:0%
own as soon as they graduate so

well thank you thank you for uh for
 
02:24:13.830 --> 02:24:13.840 align:start position:0%
bringing them so that they can
 
02:24:15.670 --> 02:24:15.680 align:start position:0%
experience a little bit of the process
 
02:24:16.950 --> 02:24:16.960 align:start position:0%
of how
 
02:24:18.870 --> 02:24:18.880 align:start position:0%
slow government works
 
02:24:21.030 --> 02:24:21.040 align:start position:0%

uh yes thank you mr chair and thank you
 
02:24:24.469 --> 02:24:24.479 align:start position:0%
for taking my questions one of the
 
02:24:27.030 --> 02:24:27.040 align:start position:0%
points made earlier uh was that there
 
02:24:29.030 --> 02:24:29.040 align:start position:0%
was not a significant amount of training
 
02:24:31.349 --> 02:24:31.359 align:start position:0%
in eyelash extensions in cosmetology
 
02:24:34.230 --> 02:24:34.240 align:start position:0%
school uh can you tell us what sort of
 
02:24:35.910 --> 02:24:35.920 align:start position:0%
training you do in your school for
 
02:24:40.070 --> 02:24:40.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:42.870 --> 02:24:42.880 align:start position:0%
yes thank you so in as far as eyelash
 
02:24:44.950 --> 02:24:44.960 align:start position:0%
extensions it is a small portion of our
 
02:24:48.230 --> 02:24:48.240 align:start position:0%
curriculum okay and we currently are
 
02:24:50.469 --> 02:24:50.479 align:start position:0%
opening up an eyelash extension center
 
02:24:52.309 --> 02:24:52.319 align:start position:0%
that we just we're wrapping up
 
02:24:53.990 --> 02:24:54.000 align:start position:0%
completion on the on the building this
 
02:24:55.190 --> 02:24:55.200 align:start position:0%
week actually
 
02:24:56.950 --> 02:24:56.960 align:start position:0%
and they would have to come and get
 
02:24:58.710 --> 02:24:58.720 align:start position:0%
certified in that just like in our
 
02:25:00.950 --> 02:25:00.960 align:start position:0%
makeup we have a makeup school they have
 
02:25:03.510 --> 02:25:03.520 align:start position:0%
to get certified in that but the
 
02:25:06.950 --> 02:25:06.960 align:start position:0%
cosmetology aesthetics or barber license
 
02:25:09.590 --> 02:25:09.600 align:start position:0%
helps them with sanitation practices
 
02:25:12.630 --> 02:25:12.640 align:start position:0%
and they also look at skin disorders
 
02:25:14.150 --> 02:25:14.160 align:start position:0%
and you know even when you're blow
 
02:25:16.389 --> 02:25:16.399 align:start position:0%
drying someone's hair we we teach them
 
02:25:18.230 --> 02:25:18.240 align:start position:0%
how to check their scalp
 
02:25:19.830 --> 02:25:19.840 align:start position:0%
because if they have an infection they
 
02:25:21.830 --> 02:25:21.840 align:start position:0%
have some something on their skin you
 
02:25:23.590 --> 02:25:23.600 align:start position:0%
want to make sure you don't
 
02:25:25.750 --> 02:25:25.760 align:start position:0%
harm that area
 
02:25:27.670 --> 02:25:27.680 align:start position:0%
so as far as your question they do have
 
02:25:29.429 --> 02:25:29.439 align:start position:0%
to get certified in that after they
 
02:25:30.790 --> 02:25:30.800 align:start position:0%
graduate from our program but our
 
02:25:43.270 --> 02:25:43.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:45.270 --> 02:25:45.280 align:start position:0%

of training
 
02:25:57.030 --> 02:25:57.040 align:start position:0%

02:26:00.070 --> 02:26:00.080 align:start position:0%
have to work under another licensee do
 
02:26:03.830 --> 02:26:03.840 align:start position:0%

i know i know on average we graduate
 
02:27:10.389 --> 02:27:10.399 align:start position:0%
over 300 a year
 
02:27:12.070 --> 02:27:12.080 align:start position:0%
and this salon's opening up every every
 
02:27:12.080 --> 02:27:13.110 align:start position:0%
and this salon's opening up every every

02:27:13.120 --> 02:27:13.830 align:start position:0%
day
uh

02:27:13.830 --> 02:27:13.840 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:27:16.230 --> 02:27:16.240 align:start position:0%
maybe i can ask a follow-up sure we'll
 
02:27:17.990 --> 02:27:18.000 align:start position:0%
get at some of the information i'm
 
02:27:20.630 --> 02:27:20.640 align:start position:0%
interested in so is is there a shortage
 
02:27:20.640 --> 02:27:21.429 align:start position:0%
interested in so is is there a shortage
of

02:27:21.429 --> 02:27:21.439 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:27:24.469 --> 02:27:24.479 align:start position:0%
cosmetology positions or
 
02:27:24.479 --> 02:27:25.750 align:start position:0%
cosmetology positions or
services

02:27:25.750 --> 02:27:25.760 align:start position:0%
services
 
02:27:27.910 --> 02:27:27.920 align:start position:0%
in the state of new hampshire or our
 
02:27:30.150 --> 02:27:30.160 align:start position:0%
schools and current practitioners are
 
02:27:31.429 --> 02:27:31.439 align:start position:0%
they providing
 
02:27:34.790 --> 02:27:34.800 align:start position:0%
uh the meeting the needs of the public
 
02:27:37.510 --> 02:27:37.520 align:start position:0%
well that's a great question so
 
02:27:39.910 --> 02:27:39.920 align:start position:0%
i went i graduated from umass amherst
 
02:27:41.910 --> 02:27:41.920 align:start position:0%
and when i was there and i think
 
02:27:43.670 --> 02:27:43.680 align:start position:0%
currently with unh and i heard the
 
02:27:45.270 --> 02:27:45.280 align:start position:0%
common cash cow
 
02:27:47.510 --> 02:27:47.520 align:start position:0%
these colleges are the cash cows
 
02:27:49.349 --> 02:27:49.359 align:start position:0%
because there's not a lot of regulations
 
02:27:52.389 --> 02:27:52.399 align:start position:0%
on them we are regulated to the
 
02:27:53.910 --> 02:27:53.920 align:start position:0%
you wouldn't imagine the regulations we
 
02:27:55.750 --> 02:27:55.760 align:start position:0%
have not just from the state the board
 
02:27:57.590 --> 02:27:57.600 align:start position:0%
of education but also
 
02:27:59.590 --> 02:27:59.600 align:start position:0%
nakas which is the national accrediting
 
02:28:01.429 --> 02:28:01.439 align:start position:0%
career arts and sciences
 
02:28:03.670 --> 02:28:03.680 align:start position:0%
and they require us each year to follow
 
02:28:05.510 --> 02:28:05.520 align:start position:0%
our graduates and make sure that they're
 
02:28:08.950 --> 02:28:08.960 align:start position:0%
placed in a salon we even have to show
 
02:28:11.270 --> 02:28:11.280 align:start position:0%
proof on social media in our
 
02:28:13.030 --> 02:28:13.040 align:start position:0%
documentation of this
 
02:28:15.030 --> 02:28:15.040 align:start position:0%
so we have to have
 
02:28:18.550 --> 02:28:18.560 align:start position:0%
a minimum of 60 percent placed in salons
 
02:28:20.710 --> 02:28:20.720 align:start position:0%
or spas or barber shops
 
02:28:20.720 --> 02:28:21.990 align:start position:0%
or spas or barber shops
and

02:28:21.990 --> 02:28:22.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:28:23.910 --> 02:28:23.920 align:start position:0%
we are always above that we're always
 
02:28:25.510 --> 02:28:25.520 align:start position:0%
above that and a lot of the times we
 
02:28:27.349 --> 02:28:27.359 align:start position:0%
can't find find the students that kind
 
02:28:29.190 --> 02:28:29.200 align:start position:0%
of fall off the planet after they
 
02:28:31.510 --> 02:28:31.520 align:start position:0%
graduate so it's hard to get get someone
 
02:28:33.349 --> 02:28:33.359 align:start position:0%
you know make sure they replace but we
 
02:28:35.830 --> 02:28:35.840 align:start position:0%
do a really good job of connecting with
 
02:28:38.150 --> 02:28:38.160 align:start position:0%
businesses and as far as the blow dry
 
02:28:40.230 --> 02:28:40.240 align:start position:0%
bars i do know there's a lady named jody
 
02:28:40.240 --> 02:28:41.429 align:start position:0%
bars i do know there's a lady named jody

02:28:50.550 --> 02:28:50.560 align:start position:0%
open house and she's opening up one in
 
02:28:52.790 --> 02:28:52.800 align:start position:0%
bedford one in nashville one in hudson
 
02:28:54.230 --> 02:28:54.240 align:start position:0%
and they're opening up one in the
 
02:28:57.190 --> 02:28:57.200 align:start position:0%
seacoast area in dover so the blow-dry
 
02:29:00.469 --> 02:29:00.479 align:start position:0%
bars are opening up and that was a trend
 
02:29:02.630 --> 02:29:02.640 align:start position:0%
um and i apologize i forget your name
 
02:29:02.640 --> 02:29:04.630 align:start position:0%
um and i apologize i forget your name
sir

02:29:04.630 --> 02:29:04.640 align:start position:0%
sir
 
02:29:05.830 --> 02:29:05.840 align:start position:0%
mr klein
 
02:29:07.670 --> 02:29:07.680 align:start position:0%
well mr klein
 
02:29:09.590 --> 02:29:09.600 align:start position:0%
was talking about the trends and that is
 
02:29:11.110 --> 02:29:11.120 align:start position:0%
a true statement
 
02:29:12.469 --> 02:29:12.479 align:start position:0%
new hampshire is usually a little bit
 
02:29:14.070 --> 02:29:14.080 align:start position:0%
behind the rest of the country as far as
 
02:29:16.710 --> 02:29:16.720 align:start position:0%
hair trends so that's more the reason
 
02:29:19.110 --> 02:29:19.120 align:start position:0%
why it's coming to us last because
 
02:29:21.510 --> 02:29:21.520 align:start position:0%
when i was in braintree there was a
 
02:29:24.309 --> 02:29:24.319 align:start position:0%
blow-dry bar in the in the mall there
 
02:29:26.790 --> 02:29:26.800 align:start position:0%
and um it did fantastic you know but
 
02:29:29.429 --> 02:29:29.439 align:start position:0%
this was probably eight nine years ago
 
02:29:30.950 --> 02:29:30.960 align:start position:0%
and now it's coming to new hampshire
 
02:29:32.469 --> 02:29:32.479 align:start position:0%
more um
 
02:29:34.830 --> 02:29:34.840 align:start position:0%
but there's definitely no shortage
 
02:29:37.110 --> 02:29:37.120 align:start position:0%
representative thank you one more mr
 
02:29:40.710 --> 02:29:40.720 align:start position:0%
chairman uh so uh and the services that
 
02:29:43.990 --> 02:29:44.000 align:start position:0%
that a blow dry bar would provide
 
02:29:47.830 --> 02:29:47.840 align:start position:0%
uh are they currently available at uh
 
02:29:49.510 --> 02:29:49.520 align:start position:0%
beauty salons
 
02:29:52.790 --> 02:29:52.800 align:start position:0%
yes yes uh in the salons i ran we did
 
02:29:55.110 --> 02:29:55.120 align:start position:0%
blow drys but what they're trying to do
 
02:29:57.910 --> 02:29:57.920 align:start position:0%
now is just specialize in blow drying in
 
02:30:00.230 --> 02:30:00.240 align:start position:0%

so much more than just
 
02:32:24.800 --> 02:32:26.309 align:start position:0%
so much more than just
hair

02:32:26.309 --> 02:32:26.319 align:start position:0%

02:32:54.150 --> 02:32:54.160 align:start position:0%
i do think this poses a huge safety
 
02:32:56.309 --> 02:32:56.319 align:start position:0%
hazard against
 
02:32:57.590 --> 02:32:57.600 align:start position:0%
people who would like to seek these
 
02:32:59.750 --> 02:32:59.760 align:start position:0%

whether you consider that the eyelashes
 
02:35:02.469 --> 02:35:02.479 align:start position:0%
are separated or blocked off or anything
 
02:35:03.750 --> 02:35:03.760 align:start position:0%

all of you
 
02:35:08.950 --> 02:35:08.960 align:start position:0%
if you took two strangers in front of

you right now and you said you wanted to
 
02:35:13.590 --> 02:35:13.600 align:start position:0%
get eyelash extensions or you wanted
 
02:35:15.030 --> 02:35:15.040 align:start position:0%
somebody to blow dry your hair or you
 
02:35:17.030 --> 02:35:17.040 align:start position:0%
wanted anybody touching your body
 
02:35:19.910 --> 02:35:19.920 align:start position:0%
physically are you going to
 
02:35:21.910 --> 02:35:21.920 align:start position:0%
lean towards the person that is licensed
 
02:35:23.910 --> 02:35:23.920 align:start position:0%
and certified to do these services or
 
02:35:25.349 --> 02:35:25.359 align:start position:0%
are you going to trust somebody that has
 
02:35:28.389 --> 02:35:28.399 align:start position:0%
no license whatsoever to touch you
 
02:35:30.790 --> 02:35:30.800 align:start position:0%
i also say with the eyelash extensions
 
02:35:33.030 --> 02:35:33.040 align:start position:0%
you do go through further certification
 
02:35:34.870 --> 02:35:34.880 align:start position:0%
other than just your cosmetology license
 
02:35:36.790 --> 02:35:36.800 align:start position:0%
you have to obtain that or you go
 
02:35:38.630 --> 02:35:38.640 align:start position:0%
through your aesthetics program
 
02:35:41.750 --> 02:35:41.760 align:start position:0%
but say somebody has an adverse reaction
 
02:35:43.349 --> 02:35:43.359 align:start position:0%
to that adhesive
 
02:35:45.270 --> 02:35:45.280 align:start position:0%
are you more comfortable having somebody
 
02:35:47.429 --> 02:35:47.439 align:start position:0%
who's certified and qualified to take it
 
02:35:50.870 --> 02:35:50.880 align:start position:0%
off and remove it and has a license to
 
02:35:52.950 --> 02:35:52.960 align:start position:0%
rely on for it or are you going to just
 
02:35:54.309 --> 02:35:54.319 align:start position:0%
have like one of your friends that's not
 
02:35:56.309 --> 02:35:56.319 align:start position:0%
trained to do it so say you have an
 
02:35:58.469 --> 02:35:58.479 align:start position:0%
allergic reaction do you want somebody
 
02:36:00.230 --> 02:36:00.240 align:start position:0%
that has a license that you can hold
 
02:36:00.240 --> 02:36:01.429 align:start position:0%
that has a license that you can hold
accountable

02:36:01.429 --> 02:36:01.439 align:start position:0%
accountable
 
02:36:04.150 --> 02:36:04.160 align:start position:0%
for that or do you want whatsoever who
 
02:36:06.550 --> 02:36:06.560 align:start position:0%
at the end of the
 
02:36:08.710 --> 02:36:08.720 align:start position:0%
day you have no accountability from that
 
02:36:11.030 --> 02:36:11.040 align:start position:0%
person because hey you trusted me to do
 
02:36:12.710 --> 02:36:12.720 align:start position:0%
it and i don't have a license to say
 
02:36:15.590 --> 02:36:15.600 align:start position:0%
that i am certified to do it personally
 
02:36:18.070 --> 02:36:18.080 align:start position:0%
if i were to go to the hospital the er
 
02:36:20.230 --> 02:36:20.240 align:start position:0%
with an allergic reaction to an adhesive
 
02:36:20.240 --> 02:36:21.030 align:start position:0%
with an allergic reaction to an adhesive
or

02:36:21.030 --> 02:36:21.040 align:start position:0%
or
 
02:36:24.150 --> 02:36:24.160 align:start position:0%
a burn on my scalp that was severe from
 
02:36:26.070 --> 02:36:26.080 align:start position:0%
somebody that was not licensed i have
 
02:36:27.750 --> 02:36:27.760 align:start position:0%
nothing to hold that person accountable
 
02:36:30.230 --> 02:36:30.240 align:start position:0%
for injuring me or causing a reaction
 
02:36:32.710 --> 02:36:32.720 align:start position:0%
whereas with a license somebody can take
 
02:36:32.720 --> 02:36:33.510 align:start position:0%
whereas with a license somebody can take
that

02:36:33.510 --> 02:36:33.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:36:36.309 --> 02:36:36.319 align:start position:0%
to law like a lawsuit and i would be
 
02:36:37.910 --> 02:36:37.920 align:start position:0%
more comfortable personally having
 
02:36:40.469 --> 02:36:40.479 align:start position:0%
somebody that i can be like hey you
 
02:36:43.030 --> 02:36:43.040 align:start position:0%
injured me hey you did this and maybe
 
02:36:45.670 --> 02:36:45.680 align:start position:0%
they would get you know um
 
02:36:47.750 --> 02:36:47.760 align:start position:0%
in trouble for it quote unquote
 
02:36:49.990 --> 02:36:50.000 align:start position:0%
um but i just think at the end of the
 
02:36:50.000 --> 02:36:52.150 align:start position:0%
um but i just think at the end of the
day

02:36:52.150 --> 02:36:52.160 align:start position:0%
day
 
02:36:53.830 --> 02:36:53.840 align:start position:0%
i'm not i don't personally think it's
 
02:36:56.230 --> 02:36:56.240 align:start position:0%
going to create more jobs by letting
 
02:36:59.510 --> 02:36:59.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:01.670 --> 02:37:01.680 align:start position:0%
um and i think it's a personal decision
 
02:37:03.830 --> 02:37:03.840 align:start position:0%
for each and every student with me we've
 
02:37:08.550 --> 02:37:08.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:10.710 --> 02:37:10.720 align:start position:0%
it and i think that
 
02:37:12.070 --> 02:37:12.080 align:start position:0%
at the end of the day we go through all
 
02:37:14.630 --> 02:37:14.640 align:start position:0%
of this training and as for other
 
02:37:17.030 --> 02:37:17.040 align:start position:0%
schools and other states requiring less
 
02:37:19.750 --> 02:37:19.760 align:start position:0%
hours and people thinking
 
02:37:22.389 --> 02:37:22.399 align:start position:0%
are attesting that the 15 hours 1500
 
02:37:25.190 --> 02:37:25.200 align:start position:0%
hours is excessive
 
02:37:27.429 --> 02:37:27.439 align:start position:0%
i started going to school my first
 
02:37:28.950 --> 02:37:28.960 align:start position:0%
school i started with was not empire
 
02:37:30.150 --> 02:37:30.160 align:start position:0%
beauty school i started going to
 
02:37:30.160 --> 02:37:31.429 align:start position:0%
beauty school i started going to
continental

02:37:31.429 --> 02:37:31.439 align:start position:0%
continental
 
02:37:34.710 --> 02:37:34.720 align:start position:0%
and beauty school in hudson and we had
 
02:37:35.830 --> 02:37:35.840 align:start position:0%
more than half of the girls that
 
02:37:37.190 --> 02:37:37.200 align:start position:0%
attended there with us were actually
 
02:37:39.670 --> 02:37:39.680 align:start position:0%
from massachusetts and they
 
02:37:41.190 --> 02:37:41.200 align:start position:0%
chose to go to a new hampshire school
 
02:37:42.870 --> 02:37:42.880 align:start position:0%
because they believed that
 
02:37:45.030 --> 02:37:45.040 align:start position:0%
the 1500 hours was better than just
 
02:37:46.630 --> 02:37:46.640 align:start position:0%
getting a thousand hours they felt more
 
02:37:48.389 --> 02:37:48.399 align:start position:0%
comfortable going to a school where they
 
02:37:49.990 --> 02:37:50.000 align:start position:0%
were required to have more hours in
 
02:37:50.000 --> 02:37:50.950 align:start position:0%
were required to have more hours in
training

02:37:50.950 --> 02:37:50.960 align:start position:0%
training
 
02:37:54.550 --> 02:37:54.560 align:start position:0%
than their hometowns of massachusetts
 
02:37:56.230 --> 02:37:56.240 align:start position:0%
if you have any other questions that's
 
02:37:56.240 --> 02:37:56.950 align:start position:0%
if you have any other questions that's
all

02:37:56.950 --> 02:37:56.960 align:start position:0%
all
 
02:37:59.190 --> 02:37:59.200 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony
 
02:38:06.870 --> 02:38:06.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:20.150 --> 02:38:20.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:22.710 --> 02:38:22.720 align:start position:0%
hi my name is kelly cross kelly marie is
 
02:38:25.190 --> 02:38:25.200 align:start position:0%
my formal name but kelly cross i'm miss
 
02:38:27.510 --> 02:38:27.520 align:start position:0%
kelly to these guys i am an instructor
 
02:38:30.070 --> 02:38:30.080 align:start position:0%
with empire beauty schools i'm also
 
02:38:31.830 --> 02:38:31.840 align:start position:0%
licensed in the state of new hampshire
 
02:38:34.230 --> 02:38:34.240 align:start position:0%
for so long that my license only has
 
02:38:35.990 --> 02:38:36.000 align:start position:0%
three numbers i've been licensed in new
 
02:38:38.790 --> 02:38:38.800 align:start position:0%
hampshire for 28 years
 
02:38:40.870 --> 02:38:40.880 align:start position:0%
and i'm definitely opposed to this bill
 
02:38:42.710 --> 02:38:42.720 align:start position:0%
i've worked in new hampshire i've moved
 
02:38:45.110 --> 02:38:45.120 align:start position:0%
to california ohio
 
02:38:46.630 --> 02:38:46.640 align:start position:0%
and reciprocated there moved to
 
02:38:49.110 --> 02:38:49.120 align:start position:0%
california and reciprocated there so i
 
02:38:50.710 --> 02:38:50.720 align:start position:0%
do have some experience elsewhere in the
 
02:38:53.830 --> 02:38:53.840 align:start position:0%
country i think that the 15 hours 1500
 
02:38:56.790 --> 02:38:56.800 align:start position:0%
hours that we have in this state
 
02:38:59.910 --> 02:38:59.920 align:start position:0%
is absolutely necessary and it is the
 
02:39:02.070 --> 02:39:02.080 align:start position:0%
bare minimum that we have or that we
 
02:39:04.230 --> 02:39:04.240 align:start position:0%
need to be able to accomplish what we
 
02:39:05.990 --> 02:39:06.000 align:start position:0%
need to accomplish
 
02:39:08.309 --> 02:39:08.319 align:start position:0%
and to be able to walk into a salon and
 
02:39:10.630 --> 02:39:10.640 align:start position:0%
be confident in knowing that we are able
 
02:39:12.870 --> 02:39:12.880 align:start position:0%
to take care of all of the issues that
 
02:39:14.870 --> 02:39:14.880 align:start position:0%
could potentially arise
 
02:39:14.880 --> 02:39:15.750 align:start position:0%
could potentially arise
um

02:39:15.750 --> 02:39:15.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:39:17.349 --> 02:39:17.359 align:start position:0%
sorry i just wrote my i'm like i'm a
 
02:39:18.870 --> 02:39:18.880 align:start position:0%
little heated right now so i'm going to
 
02:39:21.750 --> 02:39:21.760 align:start position:0%
try to keep my composure
 
02:39:27.830 --> 02:39:27.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:29.990 --> 02:39:30.000 align:start position:0%
sorry thank you i put my heart and soul
 
02:39:31.990 --> 02:39:32.000 align:start position:0%
into it for 28 years
 
02:39:33.830 --> 02:39:33.840 align:start position:0%
and i
 
02:39:35.349 --> 02:39:35.359 align:start position:0%
take very great
 
02:39:36.790 --> 02:39:36.800 align:start position:0%
issue with anything that i feel
 
02:39:38.790 --> 02:39:38.800 align:start position:0%
threatens that
 
02:39:40.309 --> 02:39:40.319 align:start position:0%
one of the issues that i wanted to bring
 
02:39:42.070 --> 02:39:42.080 align:start position:0%
up that no one has brought up so far as
 
02:39:44.630 --> 02:39:44.640 align:start position:0%
far specifically the blow dry bars
 
02:39:47.190 --> 02:39:47.200 align:start position:0%
is the tools that we use to blow dry and
 
02:39:49.110 --> 02:39:49.120 align:start position:0%
flat iron and curl hair
 
02:39:51.429 --> 02:39:51.439 align:start position:0%
all of those they can reach up to 450
 
02:39:55.030 --> 02:39:55.040 align:start position:0%
500 degrees they can pose a safety risk
 
02:39:57.190 --> 02:39:57.200 align:start position:0%
for people it would be very easy to burn
 
02:39:57.200 --> 02:39:58.469 align:start position:0%
for people it would be very easy to burn
people

02:39:58.469 --> 02:39:58.479 align:start position:0%
people
 
02:40:00.070 --> 02:40:00.080 align:start position:0%
if you're not educated on how to use
 
02:40:02.550 --> 02:40:02.560 align:start position:0%
these tools properly also you know how
 
02:40:04.870 --> 02:40:04.880 align:start position:0%
to properly disinfect them and perform
 
02:40:06.389 --> 02:40:06.399 align:start position:0%
maintenance on these tools
 
02:40:09.670 --> 02:40:09.680 align:start position:0%
is something that we cover
 
02:40:11.429 --> 02:40:11.439 align:start position:0%
as far as like
 
02:40:13.510 --> 02:40:13.520 align:start position:0%
people wanting to offer these specialty
 
02:40:15.429 --> 02:40:15.439 align:start position:0%
services and just have just these
 
02:40:15.439 --> 02:40:17.590 align:start position:0%
services and just have just these
limited

02:40:17.590 --> 02:40:17.600 align:start position:0%
limited
 
02:40:20.389 --> 02:40:20.399 align:start position:0%
salons that offer niche services
 
02:40:22.870 --> 02:40:22.880 align:start position:0%
in my opinion this is very similar to a
 
02:40:25.030 --> 02:40:25.040 align:start position:0%
doctor who only wants to practice
 
02:40:27.910 --> 02:40:27.920 align:start position:0%
pediatrics or gynecology he still has to
 
02:40:30.870 --> 02:40:30.880 align:start position:0%
go through and get his original md
 
02:40:32.469 --> 02:40:32.479 align:start position:0%
license before he can become a
 
02:40:32.479 --> 02:40:34.950 align:start position:0%
license before he can become a
specialist

02:40:34.950 --> 02:40:34.960 align:start position:0%
specialist
 
02:40:37.190 --> 02:40:37.200 align:start position:0%
and yes it may be a different degree but
 
02:40:40.230 --> 02:40:40.240 align:start position:0%
also we do cover a lot more than just
 
02:40:42.150 --> 02:40:42.160 align:start position:0%
blow drying your hair
 
02:40:43.910 --> 02:40:43.920 align:start position:0%
i would challenge anyone in this room
 
02:40:46.469 --> 02:40:46.479 align:start position:0%
who is not experienced in doing hair to
 
02:40:48.389 --> 02:40:48.399 align:start position:0%
pick up a blow dryer and a curling iron
 
02:40:51.110 --> 02:40:51.120 align:start position:0%
and no and do what these guys can do
 
02:40:52.150 --> 02:40:52.160 align:start position:0%
you're not going to be able to
 
02:40:54.469 --> 02:40:54.479 align:start position:0%
understand it or to do it you very
 
02:40:56.870 --> 02:40:56.880 align:start position:0%
easily um you could burn somebody's hair
 
02:40:58.469 --> 02:40:58.479 align:start position:0%
off you can burn their scalp to where
 
02:41:00.469 --> 02:41:00.479 align:start position:0%
their hair will never grow back
 
02:41:02.710 --> 02:41:02.720 align:start position:0%
it's not something that's just like oh
 
02:41:04.309 --> 02:41:04.319 align:start position:0%
i'm just going to willy nilly pick up a
 
02:41:06.790 --> 02:41:06.800 align:start position:0%
blow dryer and be able to perform this
 
02:41:10.870 --> 02:41:10.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:12.630 --> 02:41:12.640 align:start position:0%
as far as it being like a low level
 
02:41:15.030 --> 02:41:15.040 align:start position:0%
skill set again i would challenge you to
 
02:41:17.590 --> 02:41:17.600 align:start position:0%
ask any of my students behind me whether
 
02:41:20.550 --> 02:41:20.560 align:start position:0%
they think that a proper blowout is is a
 
02:41:23.830 --> 02:41:23.840 align:start position:0%
low level skill set it takes a lot of
 
02:41:25.910 --> 02:41:25.920 align:start position:0%
knowledge of the hair textures varying
 
02:41:28.070 --> 02:41:28.080 align:start position:0%
different hair textures everyone in this
 
02:41:30.150 --> 02:41:30.160 align:start position:0%
room has a different hair texture that
 
02:41:32.870 --> 02:41:32.880 align:start position:0%
needs to be treated differently
 
02:41:35.349 --> 02:41:35.359 align:start position:0%
and that if the service is not performed
 
02:41:37.670 --> 02:41:37.680 align:start position:0%
safely it can cause lasting damage to
 
02:41:40.070 --> 02:41:40.080 align:start position:0%
your scalp and your hair if you're not
 
02:41:41.429 --> 02:41:41.439 align:start position:0%
trained on how to do these things
 
02:41:43.910 --> 02:41:43.920 align:start position:0%
properly it's not as low level as some
 
02:41:45.910 --> 02:41:45.920 align:start position:0%
people might think that it is
 
02:41:47.670 --> 02:41:47.680 align:start position:0%
the same thing with applying the
 
02:41:50.630 --> 02:41:50.640 align:start position:0%
eyelashes and the makeup you know
 
02:41:52.309 --> 02:41:52.319 align:start position:0%
these are different chemicals that we
 
02:41:54.950 --> 02:41:54.960 align:start position:0%
work with even just down to a shampoo
 
02:41:57.269 --> 02:41:57.279 align:start position:0%
knowing which shampoo to use on people
 
02:41:59.910 --> 02:41:59.920 align:start position:0%
and recognizing allergic reactions is
 
02:42:01.830 --> 02:42:01.840 align:start position:0%
something that we train our students to
 
02:42:04.389 --> 02:42:04.399 align:start position:0%
do there's a reason hair school takes
 
02:42:06.070 --> 02:42:06.080 align:start position:0%
1500 hours
 
02:42:07.910 --> 02:42:07.920 align:start position:0%
we are like one of my students was
 
02:42:10.309 --> 02:42:10.319 align:start position:0%
saying you know we do cover anatomy and
 
02:42:12.710 --> 02:42:12.720 align:start position:0%
physiology we teach the children how to
 
02:42:15.190 --> 02:42:15.200 align:start position:0%
or the students excuse me how to
 
02:42:15.200 --> 02:42:17.349 align:start position:0%
or the students excuse me how to
recognize

02:42:17.349 --> 02:42:17.359 align:start position:0%
recognize
 
02:42:19.190 --> 02:42:19.200 align:start position:0%
allergic reactions that are happening to
 
02:42:21.990 --> 02:42:22.000 align:start position:0%
recognize skin conditions
 
02:42:22.000 --> 02:42:23.190 align:start position:0%
recognize skin conditions
to

02:42:23.190 --> 02:42:23.200 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:42:26.070 --> 02:42:26.080 align:start position:0%
safely avoid causing damage to their
 
02:42:26.080 --> 02:42:28.550 align:start position:0%
safely avoid causing damage to their
clients

02:42:28.550 --> 02:42:28.560 align:start position:0%
clients
 
02:42:30.150 --> 02:42:30.160 align:start position:0%
as far as
 
02:42:32.469 --> 02:42:32.479 align:start position:0%
the eyelash adhesives being something
 
02:42:35.349 --> 02:42:35.359 align:start position:0%
that people can pick up in the drugstore
 
02:42:37.750 --> 02:42:37.760 align:start position:0%
and do at home and children can do it so
 
02:42:39.830 --> 02:42:39.840 align:start position:0%
is hair color that doesn't mean it's
 
02:42:41.349 --> 02:42:41.359 align:start position:0%
safe and that doesn't mean it should be
 
02:42:43.510 --> 02:42:43.520 align:start position:0%
regulated shouldn't be regulated hair
 
02:42:45.429 --> 02:42:45.439 align:start position:0%
color you can i can go to cvs right now
 
02:42:47.670 --> 02:42:47.680 align:start position:0%
and buy it and put it on myself but that
 
02:42:49.590 --> 02:42:49.600 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean it's a safe thing for me to
 
02:42:51.349 --> 02:42:51.359 align:start position:0%
do and it doesn't mean that it's not
 
02:42:55.670 --> 02:42:55.680 align:start position:0%
something that should be regulated
 
02:42:58.150 --> 02:42:58.160 align:start position:0%
it can still be risky and damp and
 
02:43:00.150 --> 02:43:00.160 align:start position:0%
dangerous and it can still cause injury
 
02:43:02.230 --> 02:43:02.240 align:start position:0%
to someone even if something as far as
 
02:43:02.240 --> 02:43:03.269 align:start position:0%
to someone even if something as far as
getting

02:43:03.269 --> 02:43:03.279 align:start position:0%
getting
 
02:43:04.950 --> 02:43:04.960 align:start position:0%
product in the eyes
 
02:43:06.550 --> 02:43:06.560 align:start position:0%
i personally have known three people
 
02:43:09.269 --> 02:43:09.279 align:start position:0%
that have had their eyelashes glued shut
 
02:43:11.510 --> 02:43:11.520 align:start position:0%
and had to go to the emergency room and
 
02:43:14.070 --> 02:43:14.080 align:start position:0%
have it fixed for them three that's just
 
02:43:15.750 --> 02:43:15.760 align:start position:0%
my personal experience i've known three
 
02:43:17.750 --> 02:43:17.760 align:start position:0%
people that that's happened to
 
02:43:20.150 --> 02:43:20.160 align:start position:0%
because it wasn't done properly by
 
02:43:21.429 --> 02:43:21.439 align:start position:0%
someone who is
 
02:43:24.790 --> 02:43:24.800 align:start position:0%
properly trained to do these things
 
02:43:27.910 --> 02:43:27.920 align:start position:0%
as far as the business models
 
02:43:30.870 --> 02:43:30.880 align:start position:0%
you know looking for a less expensive
 
02:43:33.349 --> 02:43:33.359 align:start position:0%
option to the to the licensure i would
 
02:43:34.710 --> 02:43:34.720 align:start position:0%
just say that that
 
02:43:37.030 --> 02:43:37.040 align:start position:0%
if you are going to open a business in
 
02:43:39.750 --> 02:43:39.760 align:start position:0%
new hampshire the licensure required
 
02:43:41.830 --> 02:43:41.840 align:start position:0%
ought to be part of your business plan
 
02:43:44.309 --> 02:43:44.319 align:start position:0%
and it ought to be incorporated into
 
02:43:45.590 --> 02:43:45.600 align:start position:0%
your business plan when you are
 
02:43:48.469 --> 02:43:48.479 align:start position:0%
accounting for the cost of opening that
 
02:43:50.870 --> 02:43:50.880 align:start position:0%
business and if you cannot afford the
 
02:43:52.870 --> 02:43:52.880 align:start position:0%
cost of properly licensing the
 
02:43:55.030 --> 02:43:55.040 align:start position:0%
professionals that you work with perhaps
 
02:43:56.870 --> 02:43:56.880 align:start position:0%
you should open a different business
 
02:43:59.030 --> 02:43:59.040 align:start position:0%
with less restrictions or perhaps you
 
02:44:02.230 --> 02:44:02.240 align:start position:0%
should rethink your business model so
 
02:44:03.590 --> 02:44:03.600 align:start position:0%

02:44:05.349 --> 02:44:05.359 align:start position:0%
place i was writing notes as people were
 
02:44:05.359 --> 02:44:06.790 align:start position:0%

like to thank you guys first and
 
02:45:02.870 --> 02:45:02.880 align:start position:0%
foremost for allowing me to speak um
 
02:45:06.309 --> 02:45:06.319 align:start position:0%
i am coming up here today because i do
 
02:45:08.710 --> 02:45:08.720 align:start position:0%
not agree with the passing of the bill
 
02:45:08.720 --> 02:45:09.830 align:start position:0%
not agree with the passing of the bill
however

02:45:09.830 --> 02:45:09.840 align:start position:0%
however
 
02:45:12.550 --> 02:45:12.560 align:start position:0%
after listening to some very
 
02:45:15.429 --> 02:45:15.439 align:start position:0%
very well points that have been made by
 
02:45:17.750 --> 02:45:17.760 align:start position:0%
others in support of the bill
 
02:45:20.790 --> 02:45:20.800 align:start position:0%
um i feel that
 
02:45:23.830 --> 02:45:23.840 align:start position:0%
excuse me i apologize um
 
02:45:26.230 --> 02:45:26.240 align:start position:0%
so i feel that
 
02:45:26.240 --> 02:45:27.349 align:start position:0%
so i feel that
by

02:45:27.349 --> 02:45:27.359 align:start position:0%
by
 
02:45:29.590 --> 02:45:29.600 align:start position:0%
having um
 
02:45:32.070 --> 02:45:32.080 align:start position:0%
an education in cosmetology specifically
 
02:45:33.910 --> 02:45:33.920 align:start position:0%
blow drying and washing hair and
 
02:45:35.429 --> 02:45:35.439 align:start position:0%
everything as other people have made the
 
02:45:37.190 --> 02:45:37.200 align:start position:0%
point that you've already heard
 
02:45:39.269 --> 02:45:39.279 align:start position:0%
um it does
 
02:45:41.269 --> 02:45:41.279 align:start position:0%
you have to have education on that to
 
02:45:43.510 --> 02:45:43.520 align:start position:0%
make sure there's no contraindications
 
02:45:45.830 --> 02:45:45.840 align:start position:0%
that occur to the client that you're
 
02:45:48.389 --> 02:45:48.399 align:start position:0%
taking care of
 
02:45:51.590 --> 02:45:51.600 align:start position:0%
and also for the cultural and financial
 
02:45:53.110 --> 02:45:53.120 align:start position:0%
aspect i
 
02:45:55.590 --> 02:45:55.600 align:start position:0%
heavily agree with that as well i do
 
02:45:58.710 --> 02:45:58.720 align:start position:0%
feel that the best option would be
 
02:46:02.389 --> 02:46:02.399 align:start position:0%
to have a certain type of certification
 
02:46:02.399 --> 02:46:03.670 align:start position:0%
to have a certain type of certification
um

02:46:03.670 --> 02:46:03.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:46:03.680 --> 02:46:04.550 align:start position:0%
um
that

02:46:04.550 --> 02:46:04.560 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:46:06.469 --> 02:46:06.479 align:start position:0%
allows people to get the proper
 
02:46:08.389 --> 02:46:08.399 align:start position:0%
education for sanitation because that's
 
02:46:10.550 --> 02:46:10.560 align:start position:0%
very important especially nowadays with
 
02:46:12.309 --> 02:46:12.319 align:start position:0%
everything going around
 
02:46:12.319 --> 02:46:15.110 align:start position:0%
everything going around
um

02:46:15.110 --> 02:46:15.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:17.990 --> 02:46:18.000 align:start position:0%
but however it is it is pricey it is a
 
02:46:19.670 --> 02:46:19.680 align:start position:0%
pricey um
 
02:46:21.429 --> 02:46:21.439 align:start position:0%
cost for tuition
 
02:46:21.439 --> 02:46:22.550 align:start position:0%
cost for tuition
um

02:46:22.550 --> 02:46:22.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:46:26.070 --> 02:46:26.080 align:start position:0%
but i feel that if people want to go
 
02:46:28.710 --> 02:46:28.720 align:start position:0%
into blow drying or doing eyelash
 
02:46:30.710 --> 02:46:30.720 align:start position:0%
extensions that of course there should
 
02:46:32.469 --> 02:46:32.479 align:start position:0%
be a course
 
02:46:34.710 --> 02:46:34.720 align:start position:0%
for them to take just to make sure that
 
02:46:36.389 --> 02:46:36.399 align:start position:0%
they're up and current with everything
 
02:46:39.750 --> 02:46:39.760 align:start position:0%
that is changing because as you know
 
02:46:41.510 --> 02:46:41.520 align:start position:0%
everything's changing in cosmetology
 
02:46:44.870 --> 02:46:44.880 align:start position:0%
it's a very fast paced fast-moving um
 
02:46:44.880 --> 02:46:47.670 align:start position:0%
it's a very fast paced fast-moving um
career

02:46:47.670 --> 02:46:47.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:50.389 --> 02:46:50.399 align:start position:0%
so yes that is my
 
02:46:52.550 --> 02:46:52.560 align:start position:0%

proposed legislation would do it would
 
02:48:31.429 --> 02:48:31.439 align:start position:0%

02:48:42.630 --> 02:48:42.640 align:start position:0%
what we're going to be talking about um
 
02:48:44.710 --> 02:48:44.720 align:start position:0%
roman numeral 1 it shall be unlawful for
 
02:48:47.110 --> 02:48:47.120 align:start position:0%
any person to use an unfair deceptive
 
02:48:49.190 --> 02:48:49.200 align:start position:0%
act or practice in the provision of any
 
02:48:49.200 --> 02:48:50.550 align:start position:0%
act or practice in the provision of any
service

02:48:50.550 --> 02:48:50.560 align:start position:0%
service
 
02:48:53.349 --> 02:48:53.359 align:start position:0%
authored under this chapter
 
02:48:56.469 --> 02:48:56.479 align:start position:0%
or deceptive act or practice shall
 
02:48:57.990 --> 02:48:58.000 align:start position:0%
include the making publishing
 
02:49:00.150 --> 02:49:00.160 align:start position:0%
dissemination circulation aiding and
 
02:49:02.230 --> 02:49:02.240 align:start position:0%
abetting or the encouraging of any
 
02:49:04.870 --> 02:49:04.880 align:start position:0%
making publication or dissemination of
 
02:49:06.870 --> 02:49:06.880 align:start position:0%
any oral or written statement that is
 
02:49:09.269 --> 02:49:09.279 align:start position:0%
false disparaging and intended to injure
 
02:49:11.110 --> 02:49:11.120 align:start position:0%
the reputation of a person licensed
 
02:49:12.389 --> 02:49:12.399 align:start position:0%
under this chapter
 
02:49:15.030 --> 02:49:15.040 align:start position:0%
and then roman numeral 2 any violation
 
02:49:17.590 --> 02:49:17.600 align:start position:0%
of paragraph 1 shall be subject to
 
02:49:22.550 --> 02:49:22.560 align:start position:0%
enforcement pursuant to rsa 358 a4 which
 
02:49:26.309 --> 02:49:26.319 align:start position:0%
is part of the consumer protection act
 
02:49:26.319 --> 02:49:29.190 align:start position:0%
is part of the consumer protection act
um

02:49:29.190 --> 02:49:29.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:31.910 --> 02:49:31.920 align:start position:0%
the the first uh point that i'd like to
 
02:49:33.750 --> 02:49:33.760 align:start position:0%
to make is that
 
02:49:33.760 --> 02:49:34.790 align:start position:0%
to make is that
um

02:49:34.790 --> 02:49:34.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:49:36.950 --> 02:49:36.960 align:start position:0%
under that section of the consumer
 
02:49:38.830 --> 02:49:38.840 align:start position:0%
protection act which is the civil
 
02:49:38.840 --> 02:49:40.469 align:start position:0%
protection act which is the civil
enforcement

02:49:40.469 --> 02:49:40.479 align:start position:0%
enforcement
 
02:49:44.469 --> 02:49:44.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:46.389 --> 02:49:46.399 align:start position:0%
it gives the attorney that part of the
 
02:49:48.230 --> 02:49:48.240 align:start position:0%
act gives the attorney general's office
 
02:49:50.790 --> 02:49:50.800 align:start position:0%
the authority to enforce the act
 
02:49:50.800 --> 02:49:52.150 align:start position:0%
the authority to enforce the act
civilly

02:49:52.150 --> 02:49:52.160 align:start position:0%
civilly
 
02:49:52.160 --> 02:49:55.269 align:start position:0%
civilly
um

02:49:55.269 --> 02:49:55.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:55.279 --> 02:49:57.030 align:start position:0%
 
the

02:49:57.030 --> 02:49:57.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:49:58.070 --> 02:49:58.080 align:start position:0%
i want to just
 
02:49:59.990 --> 02:50:00.000 align:start position:0%
reference the language in that
 
02:50:01.990 --> 02:50:02.000 align:start position:0%
particular part of the consumer
 
02:50:07.830 --> 02:50:07.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:09.670 --> 02:50:09.680 align:start position:0%
roman numeral iii
 
02:50:11.590 --> 02:50:11.600 align:start position:0%
whenever the attorney general has reason
 
02:50:13.510 --> 02:50:13.520 align:start position:0%
to believe that trade or commerce
 
02:50:16.389 --> 02:50:16.399 align:start position:0%
declared unlawful by this chapter has
 
02:50:18.150 --> 02:50:18.160 align:start position:0%
been is being or is about to be
 
02:50:19.910 --> 02:50:19.920 align:start position:0%
conducted by any person the attorney
 
02:50:21.750 --> 02:50:21.760 align:start position:0%
general may bring an action and it
 
02:50:24.950 --> 02:50:24.960 align:start position:0%
continues the key language there is that
 
02:50:27.030 --> 02:50:27.040 align:start position:0%
the attorney general has the authority
 
02:50:30.309 --> 02:50:30.319 align:start position:0%
to enforce violations of this chapter
 
02:50:32.790 --> 02:50:32.800 align:start position:0%
which means the consumer protection act
 
02:50:35.429 --> 02:50:35.439 align:start position:0%
so what this
 
02:50:39.670 --> 02:50:39.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:42.230 --> 02:50:42.240 align:start position:0%
essentially the the new statute is
 
02:50:46.630 --> 02:50:46.640 align:start position:0%
creating a a new language a new area of
 
02:50:48.630 --> 02:50:48.640 align:start position:0%
enforcement for the attorney general's
 
02:50:50.950 --> 02:50:50.960 align:start position:0%
office that is outside of the consumer
 
02:50:54.309 --> 02:50:54.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:56.710 --> 02:50:56.720 align:start position:0%
so in in in a sense the consumer
 
02:50:59.110 --> 02:50:59.120 align:start position:0%
protection act is written so that it
 
02:51:01.349 --> 02:51:01.359 align:start position:0%
essentially can enforce the prohibited
 
02:51:03.910 --> 02:51:03.920 align:start position:0%
conduct that is listed in the consumer
 
02:51:05.429 --> 02:51:05.439 align:start position:0%
protection act and it doesn't
 
02:51:08.309 --> 02:51:08.319 align:start position:0%
necessarily include prohibited acts that
 
02:51:10.630 --> 02:51:10.640 align:start position:0%
are in other chapters in this case the
 
02:51:13.110 --> 02:51:13.120 align:start position:0%
practice act for the profession
 
02:51:15.349 --> 02:51:15.359 align:start position:0%
um so that's that's an issue that i just
 
02:51:17.910 --> 02:51:17.920 align:start position:0%
asked the board to to consider
 
02:51:20.230 --> 02:51:20.240 align:start position:0%
the second issue is that the consumer
 
02:51:23.429 --> 02:51:23.439 align:start position:0%
protection act already has similar
 
02:51:26.070 --> 02:51:26.080 align:start position:0%
language to what's being proposed
 
02:51:26.080 --> 02:51:28.630 align:start position:0%
language to what's being proposed
um

02:51:28.630 --> 02:51:28.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:31.190 --> 02:51:31.200 align:start position:0%
rsa 358 a
 
02:51:34.550 --> 02:51:34.560 align:start position:0%
2 which lists the unlawful acts roman
 
02:51:36.070 --> 02:51:36.080 align:start position:0%
numeral 8
 
02:51:38.950 --> 02:51:38.960 align:start position:0%
is disparaging the good services or
 
02:51:40.870 --> 02:51:40.880 align:start position:0%
business of another by false or
 
02:51:44.389 --> 02:51:44.399 align:start position:0%
misleading representation of fact
 
02:51:46.790 --> 02:51:46.800 align:start position:0%
so that is similar but not exactly the
 
02:51:49.910 --> 02:51:49.920 align:start position:0%
same as the the proposed language uh but
 
02:51:52.389 --> 02:51:52.399 align:start position:0%
it does create the issue of having sort
 
02:51:55.190 --> 02:51:55.200 align:start position:0%
of a redundant um statute that
 
02:51:57.590 --> 02:51:57.600 align:start position:0%
essentially is is prohibiting the same
 
02:52:00.469 --> 02:52:00.479 align:start position:0%
kind of contact uh conduct
 
02:52:02.309 --> 02:52:02.319 align:start position:0%
but it also creates the additional
 
02:52:04.469 --> 02:52:04.479 align:start position:0%
problem of not being identical to the
 
02:52:06.070 --> 02:52:06.080 align:start position:0%
language of the consumer protect
 
02:52:08.389 --> 02:52:08.399 align:start position:0%
protection act so essentially we have
 
02:52:10.469 --> 02:52:10.479 align:start position:0%
um the new legislation which is sort of
 
02:52:12.950 --> 02:52:12.960 align:start position:0%
more expansive and and
 
02:52:16.550 --> 02:52:16.560 align:start position:0%
and not an exact mirror of the of what's
 
02:52:20.230 --> 02:52:20.240 align:start position:0%
in the consumer protection act already
 
02:52:22.309 --> 02:52:22.319 align:start position:0%
um so that's the second issue i asked
 
02:52:23.110 --> 02:52:23.120 align:start position:0%
the board
 
02:52:26.230 --> 02:52:26.240 align:start position:0%
the committee to consider
 
02:52:29.110 --> 02:52:29.120 align:start position:0%
next um i just want to advise the the
 
02:52:29.120 --> 02:52:30.150 align:start position:0%
next um i just want to advise the the
committee

02:52:30.150 --> 02:52:30.160 align:start position:0%
committee
 
02:52:31.429 --> 02:52:31.439 align:start position:0%
that the
 
02:52:33.349 --> 02:52:33.359 align:start position:0%
consumer protection act
 
02:52:35.750 --> 02:52:35.760 align:start position:0%
um provides remedies but there are other
 
02:52:38.070 --> 02:52:38.080 align:start position:0%
remedies outside the consumer protection
 
02:52:40.870 --> 02:52:40.880 align:start position:0%
act for the kind of disparaging comments
 
02:52:43.190 --> 02:52:43.200 align:start position:0%
that that the legislation
 
02:52:45.190 --> 02:52:45.200 align:start position:0%
is intended to prevent
 
02:52:47.429 --> 02:52:47.439 align:start position:0%
there are civil actions for slander and
 
02:52:49.670 --> 02:52:49.680 align:start position:0%
libel that that could
 
02:52:51.429 --> 02:52:51.439 align:start position:0%
solve the problem
 
02:52:53.110 --> 02:52:53.120 align:start position:0%
but there is also
 
02:52:55.190 --> 02:52:55.200 align:start position:0%
within the practice act
 
02:52:59.110 --> 02:52:59.120 align:start position:0%
the board has disciplinary authority to
 
02:53:01.429 --> 02:53:01.439 align:start position:0%
discipline licensees for unprofessional
 
02:53:03.110 --> 02:53:03.120 align:start position:0%
conduct and this kind of
 
02:53:04.870 --> 02:53:04.880 align:start position:0%
disparagement making false statements
 
02:53:07.590 --> 02:53:07.600 align:start position:0%
about a competitor that probably fits
 
02:53:10.469 --> 02:53:10.479 align:start position:0%
the definition of unprofessional conduct
 
02:53:13.110 --> 02:53:13.120 align:start position:0%
so there are already tools available to
 
02:53:18.309 --> 02:53:18.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:20.630 --> 02:53:20.640 align:start position:0%
the um the consumer protection act is
 
02:53:22.870 --> 02:53:22.880 align:start position:0%
really primarily
 
02:53:25.990 --> 02:53:26.000 align:start position:0%
a tool for protecting consumers from
 
02:53:28.230 --> 02:53:28.240 align:start position:0%
unscrupulous businesses
 
02:53:30.469 --> 02:53:30.479 align:start position:0%
not necessarily to protect businesses
 
02:53:33.349 --> 02:53:33.359 align:start position:0%
from each other
 
02:53:33.359 --> 02:53:34.469 align:start position:0%
from each other
the

02:53:34.469 --> 02:53:34.479 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:53:36.550 --> 02:53:36.560 align:start position:0%
consumer protection bureau only learned
 
02:53:37.670 --> 02:53:37.680 align:start position:0%
of this
 
02:53:40.389 --> 02:53:40.399 align:start position:0%
legislation recently so we did not have
 
02:53:42.309 --> 02:53:42.319 align:start position:0%
an opportunity to
 
02:53:44.550 --> 02:53:44.560 align:start position:0%
calculate what the impact would be if
 
02:53:47.910 --> 02:53:47.920 align:start position:0%
this legislation passed on our bureau
 
02:53:47.920 --> 02:53:48.870 align:start position:0%
this legislation passed on our bureau
but

02:53:48.870 --> 02:53:48.880 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:53:52.790 --> 02:53:52.800 align:start position:0%
at least in theory if this part of the
 
02:53:55.030 --> 02:53:55.040 align:start position:0%
statute of this proposed statute were to
 
02:53:57.190 --> 02:53:57.200 align:start position:0%
pass that could generate additional
 
02:53:57.200 --> 02:53:58.469 align:start position:0%
pass that could generate additional
complaints

02:53:58.469 --> 02:53:58.479 align:start position:0%
complaints
 
02:54:00.870 --> 02:54:00.880 align:start position:0%
which would require additional expense
 
02:54:04.309 --> 02:54:04.319 align:start position:0%
and resources for us to address
 
02:54:06.389 --> 02:54:06.399 align:start position:0%
that's the end of my comments i'd be
 
02:54:08.070 --> 02:54:08.080 align:start position:0%
happy to take any questions that you
 
02:54:08.080 --> 02:54:09.590 align:start position:0%
happy to take any questions that you
have

02:54:09.590 --> 02:54:09.600 align:start position:0%
have
 
02:54:12.309 --> 02:54:12.319 align:start position:0%
thank you representative lucas
 
02:54:14.070 --> 02:54:14.080 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
02:54:14.080 --> 02:54:14.870 align:start position:0%
thank you um
so

02:54:14.870 --> 02:54:14.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:54:17.110 --> 02:54:17.120 align:start position:0%
true kind of a two-part question uh the
 
02:54:18.389 --> 02:54:18.399 align:start position:0%
first is
 
02:54:21.990 --> 02:54:22.000 align:start position:0%
you know if we were to pass this um
 
02:54:24.950 --> 02:54:24.960 align:start position:0%
but we removed section 8
 
02:54:27.429 --> 02:54:27.439 align:start position:0%
do you believe you would be able to
 
02:54:29.429 --> 02:54:29.439 align:start position:0%
deal with the sort of issues that
 
02:54:35.510 --> 02:54:35.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:37.670 --> 02:54:37.680 align:start position:0%
i apologize um i think the consumer
 
02:54:40.550 --> 02:54:40.560 align:start position:0%
protection act as it's as it's worded
 
02:54:43.990 --> 02:54:44.000 align:start position:0%
um does prohibit um
 
02:54:45.830 --> 02:54:45.840 align:start position:0%
disparaging the goods or services or
 
02:54:47.429 --> 02:54:47.439 align:start position:0%
businesses of another by false or
 
02:54:49.590 --> 02:54:49.600 align:start position:0%
misleading representation of fact and
 
02:54:52.630 --> 02:54:52.640 align:start position:0%
and i think that is uh broad enough that
 
02:54:54.630 --> 02:54:54.640 align:start position:0%
it probably would cover
 
02:54:56.469 --> 02:54:56.479 align:start position:0%
most of the kinds of complaints that i
 
02:54:58.070 --> 02:54:58.080 align:start position:0%
would anticipate that could come in
 
02:55:00.150 --> 02:55:00.160 align:start position:0%
under under the statute
 
02:55:01.830 --> 02:55:01.840 align:start position:0%
um and and like i said there are other
 
02:55:04.469 --> 02:55:04.479 align:start position:0%
options as well administratively
 
02:55:04.479 --> 02:55:05.429 align:start position:0%
options as well administratively
um

02:55:05.429 --> 02:55:05.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:55:07.990 --> 02:55:08.000 align:start position:0%
the uh board of barbering cosmetology
 
02:55:10.389 --> 02:55:10.399 align:start position:0%
and aesthetics does have the
 
02:55:12.790 --> 02:55:12.800 align:start position:0%
you know the
 
02:55:14.630 --> 02:55:14.640 align:start position:0%
authority to enforce
 
02:55:17.349 --> 02:55:17.359 align:start position:0%
um sanctions on licensees for misconduct
 
02:55:19.190 --> 02:55:19.200 align:start position:0%
and i think this would fit
 
02:55:19.200 --> 02:55:20.389 align:start position:0%
and i think this would fit
unprofessional

02:55:20.389 --> 02:55:20.399 align:start position:0%
unprofessional
 
02:55:20.399 --> 02:55:24.630 align:start position:0%
unprofessional
follow-up

02:55:24.630 --> 02:55:24.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:26.950 --> 02:55:26.960 align:start position:0%
given that i was
 
02:55:30.150 --> 02:55:30.160 align:start position:0%
why are you concerned you know that
 
02:55:32.790 --> 02:55:32.800 align:start position:0%
keeping section 8 would cause additional
 
02:55:35.830 --> 02:55:35.840 align:start position:0%
work and expense if you're already
 
02:55:37.750 --> 02:55:37.760 align:start position:0%
in a position to deal with
 
02:55:44.710 --> 02:55:44.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:46.710 --> 02:55:46.720 align:start position:0%
well there's no way for me to know what
 
02:55:48.469 --> 02:55:48.479 align:start position:0%
whether or not there would be additional
 
02:55:50.870 --> 02:55:50.880 align:start position:0%
complaints except that
 
02:55:52.950 --> 02:55:52.960 align:start position:0%
because there's an additional statute it
 
02:55:54.710 --> 02:55:54.720 align:start position:0%
could be that someone looking at this
 
02:55:56.469 --> 02:55:56.479 align:start position:0%
statute and feeling that there was a
 
02:55:59.110 --> 02:55:59.120 align:start position:0%
violation might submit a complaint under
 
02:56:01.110 --> 02:56:01.120 align:start position:0%
this statute whereas normally their
 
02:56:02.469 --> 02:56:02.479 align:start position:0%
other option would be
 
02:56:03.990 --> 02:56:04.000 align:start position:0%
filing it with our office under the
 
02:56:05.670 --> 02:56:05.680 align:start position:0%
consumer protection act
 
02:56:07.990 --> 02:56:08.000 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
02:56:11.670 --> 02:56:11.680 align:start position:0%

is a reference to 541a
 
02:56:19.200 --> 02:56:20.790 align:start position:0%
is a reference to 541a
uh

02:56:20.790 --> 02:56:20.800 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:56:23.349 --> 02:56:23.359 align:start position:0%
missing here and should be
 
02:56:27.110 --> 02:56:27.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:28.309 --> 02:56:28.319 align:start position:0%
are you talking about the the
 
02:56:30.230 --> 02:56:30.240 align:start position:0%
administrative procedures act i am
 
02:56:32.309 --> 02:56:32.319 align:start position:0%
referring to that yes
 
02:56:32.319 --> 02:56:34.950 align:start position:0%
referring to that yes
um

02:56:34.950 --> 02:56:34.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:38.230 --> 02:56:38.240 align:start position:0%
i don't i don't think so because the
 
02:56:38.240 --> 02:56:40.710 align:start position:0%
i don't i don't think so because the
the

02:56:40.710 --> 02:56:40.720 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:56:43.429 --> 02:56:43.439 align:start position:0%
the barbering cosmetology and aesthetics
 
02:56:45.590 --> 02:56:45.600 align:start position:0%
practice act which is
 
02:56:47.030 --> 02:56:47.040 align:start position:0%
separate from the administrative
 
02:56:49.429 --> 02:56:49.439 align:start position:0%
procedures act does specifically
 
02:56:51.269 --> 02:56:51.279 align:start position:0%
prohibit unprofessional conduct and
 
02:56:55.030 --> 02:56:55.040 align:start position:0%
makes it subject to board discipline um
 
02:56:56.309 --> 02:56:56.319 align:start position:0%
i i
 
02:56:58.230 --> 02:56:58.240 align:start position:0%
i think the
 
02:56:59.830 --> 02:56:59.840 align:start position:0%
i don't know that there's anything
 
02:57:01.349 --> 02:57:01.359 align:start position:0%
specifically in the administrative
 
02:57:03.429 --> 02:57:03.439 align:start position:0%
procedures act that would that prohibits
 
02:57:05.670 --> 02:57:05.680 align:start position:0%
this conduct but the practice act for
 
02:57:09.269 --> 02:57:09.279 align:start position:0%
that profession i believe does
 
02:57:10.870 --> 02:57:10.880 align:start position:0%
representative marsh
 
02:57:12.710 --> 02:57:12.720 align:start position:0%
uh yes thank you mr chairman and thank
 
02:57:14.550 --> 02:57:14.560 align:start position:0%
you tony brown for coming before us
 
02:57:16.150 --> 02:57:16.160 align:start position:0%
attorneys sometimes write things that
 
02:57:18.550 --> 02:57:18.560 align:start position:0%
are hard to understand but i i want you
 
02:57:20.389 --> 02:57:20.399 align:start position:0%
to help me to understand this section a
 
02:57:22.870 --> 02:57:22.880 align:start position:0%
here a little bit better on line six it
 
02:57:26.550 --> 02:57:26.560 align:start position:0%
sounds like to me that this section
 
02:57:29.750 --> 02:57:29.760 align:start position:0%
uh specifically protects the reputation
 
02:57:31.750 --> 02:57:31.760 align:start position:0%
of people licensed that means the people
 
02:57:33.269 --> 02:57:33.279 align:start position:0%
that are currently licensed to do
 
02:57:33.279 --> 02:57:35.110 align:start position:0%
that are currently licensed to do
cosmetology

02:57:35.110 --> 02:57:35.120 align:start position:0%
cosmetology
 
02:57:37.030 --> 02:57:37.040 align:start position:0%
but it doesn't offer any protection to
 
02:57:38.630 --> 02:57:38.640 align:start position:0%
people who are not licensed that means
 
02:57:40.630 --> 02:57:40.640 align:start position:0%
the new people under the spill am i
 
02:57:42.309 --> 02:57:42.319 align:start position:0%
interpreting that correctly to think
 
02:57:45.030 --> 02:57:45.040 align:start position:0%
that the cosmetology licensed people
 
02:57:46.790 --> 02:57:46.800 align:start position:0%
could say disparaging remarks about the
 
02:57:49.110 --> 02:57:49.120 align:start position:0%
health and safety of all these new
 
02:57:50.870 --> 02:57:50.880 align:start position:0%
businesses that are being opened up with
 
02:57:52.870 --> 02:57:52.880 align:start position:0%
impunity under this section but the
 
02:57:54.550 --> 02:57:54.560 align:start position:0%
other people would not be able to reply
 
02:57:59.590 --> 02:57:59.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:01.670 --> 02:58:01.680 align:start position:0%
it it appears to me the way that it's
 
02:58:03.510 --> 02:58:03.520 align:start position:0%
written if i if i understand your
 
02:58:05.750 --> 02:58:05.760 align:start position:0%
question correctly it appears that the
 
02:58:07.910 --> 02:58:07.920 align:start position:0%
way it's written
 
02:58:10.070 --> 02:58:10.080 align:start position:0%
says it shall be unlawful for any person
 
02:58:12.550 --> 02:58:12.560 align:start position:0%
to use an unfair deceptive act or
 
02:58:15.670 --> 02:58:15.680 align:start position:0%
practice in the provision of any service
 
02:58:18.150 --> 02:58:18.160 align:start position:0%
so my assumption is that those are
 
02:58:19.830 --> 02:58:19.840 align:start position:0%
people that are either
 
02:58:23.190 --> 02:58:23.200 align:start position:0%
licensed in providing a service or
 
02:58:25.349 --> 02:58:25.359 align:start position:0%
are engaged in a profession that's not
 
02:58:25.359 --> 02:58:26.630 align:start position:0%
are engaged in a profession that's not
licensed

02:58:26.630 --> 02:58:26.640 align:start position:0%
licensed
 
02:58:28.630 --> 02:58:28.640 align:start position:0%
but in this case because it is specific
 
02:58:31.349 --> 02:58:31.359 align:start position:0%
to the practice act
 
02:58:33.510 --> 02:58:33.520 align:start position:0%
i would assume that what it's referring
 
02:58:34.870 --> 02:58:34.880 align:start position:0%
to is
 
02:58:39.510 --> 02:58:39.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:41.510 --> 02:58:41.520 align:start position:0%
uh thank you i just
 
02:58:44.389 --> 02:58:44.399 align:start position:0%
this is uh continues to confuse me
 
02:58:49.429 --> 02:58:49.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:50.710 --> 02:58:50.720 align:start position:0%
do we have any other questions from the
 
02:58:50.720 --> 02:58:52.309 align:start position:0%
do we have any other questions from the
committee

02:58:52.309 --> 02:58:52.319 align:start position:0%
committee
 
02:58:54.230 --> 02:58:54.240 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you sir
 
02:58:58.309 --> 02:58:58.319 align:start position:0%

from the representative from the oplc
 
02:59:02.150 --> 02:59:02.160 align:start position:0%
who can answer
 
02:59:02.160 --> 02:59:03.510 align:start position:0%

02:59:19.190 --> 02:59:19.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:30.070 --> 02:59:30.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:33.510 --> 02:59:33.520 align:start position:0%
rakia medley i am the administrator in

chief of compliance
 
02:59:40.070 --> 02:59:40.080 align:start position:0%
i'm here to
 
02:59:42.950 --> 02:59:42.960 align:start position:0%
say that oplc does not take a position
 
02:59:45.269 --> 02:59:45.279 align:start position:0%
on this bill however
 
02:59:47.110 --> 02:59:47.120 align:start position:0%
the board of barbarian cosmetology and
 
02:59:50.150 --> 02:59:50.160 align:start position:0%
aesthetics did take a vote and they do
 
02:59:51.910 --> 02:59:51.920 align:start position:0%
oppose this bill
 
02:59:54.230 --> 02:59:54.240 align:start position:0%
and i believe there are a few questions
 
02:59:54.240 --> 02:59:55.510 align:start position:0%
and i believe there are a few questions
regarding

02:59:55.510 --> 02:59:55.520 align:start position:0%

03:02:39.429 --> 03:02:39.439 align:start position:0%
this bill modifies the requirements for
 
03:02:41.830 --> 03:02:41.840 align:start position:0%
a non-resident licensure by the board of

barbering cosmetology and aesthetics
 
03:02:47.910 --> 03:02:47.920 align:start position:0%
the issue that this bill addresses
 
03:02:50.710 --> 03:02:50.720 align:start position:0%
is that under current new hampshire law
 
03:02:53.429 --> 03:02:53.439 align:start position:0%
out of state barbers cosmetologists and
 
03:02:56.070 --> 03:02:56.080 align:start position:0%
estheticians who have completed their
 
03:02:58.389 --> 03:02:58.399 align:start position:0%
education out of state
 
03:03:01.030 --> 03:03:01.040 align:start position:0%
have obtained the required training
 
03:03:01.040 --> 03:03:02.070 align:start position:0%
have obtained the required training
hours

03:03:02.070 --> 03:03:02.080 align:start position:0%
hours
 
03:03:04.309 --> 03:03:04.319 align:start position:0%
have passed the professional licensing
 
03:03:08.550 --> 03:03:08.560 align:start position:0%
exam and currently hold a valid license
 
03:03:11.190 --> 03:03:11.200 align:start position:0%
face significant barriers to be able to
 
03:03:13.750 --> 03:03:13.760 align:start position:0%
work in new hampshire due to current
 
03:03:16.389 --> 03:03:16.399 align:start position:0%
laws and derived rules
 
03:03:19.190 --> 03:03:19.200 align:start position:0%
these licensed professionals have met
 
03:03:21.670 --> 03:03:21.680 align:start position:0%
the standards and requirements of a
 
03:03:23.990 --> 03:03:24.000 align:start position:0%
state licensing body
 
03:03:26.710 --> 03:03:26.720 align:start position:0%
and have the credentials to provide
 
03:03:29.269 --> 03:03:29.279 align:start position:0%
services to consumers
 
03:03:32.150 --> 03:03:32.160 align:start position:0%
the obstacle is that licensed beauty
 
03:03:35.030 --> 03:03:35.040 align:start position:0%
professionals who move to new hampshire
 
03:03:37.349 --> 03:03:37.359 align:start position:0%
are currently prohibited from working in
 
03:03:38.630 --> 03:03:38.640 align:start position:0%
their field
 
03:03:41.269 --> 03:03:41.279 align:start position:0%
unless they successfully navigate
 
03:03:43.910 --> 03:03:43.920 align:start position:0%
onerous requirements in order for the
 
03:03:46.630 --> 03:03:46.640 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire to recognize
 
03:03:49.750 --> 03:03:49.760 align:start position:0%
their current out-of-state professional
 
03:03:49.760 --> 03:03:51.030 align:start position:0%
their current out-of-state professional
licenses

03:03:51.030 --> 03:03:51.040 align:start position:0%
licenses
 
03:03:54.630 --> 03:03:54.640 align:start position:0%
this is unnecessary and burdensome this
 
03:03:57.590 --> 03:03:57.600 align:start position:0%
hinders individuals from working in our
 
03:03:57.600 --> 03:03:58.469 align:start position:0%
hinders individuals from working in our
state

03:03:58.469 --> 03:03:58.479 align:start position:0%
state
 
03:04:01.349 --> 03:04:01.359 align:start position:0%
and this hurts our economy
 
03:04:04.309 --> 03:04:04.319 align:start position:0%
the solution that this bill provides is
 
03:04:04.319 --> 03:04:05.590 align:start position:0%
the solution that this bill provides is
simple

03:04:05.590 --> 03:04:05.600 align:start position:0%
simple
 
03:04:08.309 --> 03:04:08.319 align:start position:0%
it amends current law to recognize
 
03:04:11.110 --> 03:04:11.120 align:start position:0%
out-of-state barbering cosmetology and
 
03:04:13.269 --> 03:04:13.279 align:start position:0%
aesthetics licenses
 
03:04:16.389 --> 03:04:16.399 align:start position:0%
notably this bill removes the red tape
 
03:04:18.870 --> 03:04:18.880 align:start position:0%
for beauty professionals who have a
 
03:04:21.030 --> 03:04:21.040 align:start position:0%
current beauty license from another
 
03:04:24.309 --> 03:04:24.319 align:start position:0%
state streamlining the process
 
03:04:26.469 --> 03:04:26.479 align:start position:0%
and it repeals
 
03:04:29.110 --> 03:04:29.120 align:start position:0%
vague quote substantially equivalent
 
03:04:32.070 --> 03:04:32.080 align:start position:0%
language in current statute
 
03:04:34.150 --> 03:04:34.160 align:start position:0%
in conclusion
 
03:04:36.790 --> 03:04:36.800 align:start position:0%
this bill applies only to licensed
 
03:04:39.349 --> 03:04:39.359 align:start position:0%
beauty professionals holding a current
 
03:04:41.750 --> 03:04:41.760 align:start position:0%
valid out-of-state license
 
03:04:44.389 --> 03:04:44.399 align:start position:0%
this bill requires the board of
 
03:04:46.870 --> 03:04:46.880 align:start position:0%
barbering cosmetology and aesthetics to
 
03:04:46.880 --> 03:04:48.150 align:start position:0%
barbering cosmetology and aesthetics to
recognize

03:04:48.150 --> 03:04:48.160 align:start position:0%
recognize
 
03:04:51.190 --> 03:04:51.200 align:start position:0%
out-of-state licensing licenses without
 
03:04:52.950 --> 03:04:52.960 align:start position:0%
further requirements
 
03:04:56.070 --> 03:04:56.080 align:start position:0%
this bill enables these already licensed
 
03:04:59.030 --> 03:04:59.040 align:start position:0%
professionals to be able to work in new
 
03:05:01.429 --> 03:05:01.439 align:start position:0%
hampshire without delay
 
03:05:03.750 --> 03:05:03.760 align:start position:0%
contributing to our economy
 
03:05:05.670 --> 03:05:05.680 align:start position:0%
and lastly
 
03:05:09.429 --> 03:05:09.439 align:start position:0%
this bill benefits workers employers
 
03:05:11.190 --> 03:05:11.200 align:start position:0%
and consumers
 
03:05:14.150 --> 03:05:14.160 align:start position:0%
by creating greater access to skilled
 
03:05:16.389 --> 03:05:16.399 align:start position:0%
labor and professionally licensed
 
03:05:18.950 --> 03:05:18.960 align:start position:0%
services in the granite state
 
03:05:21.269 --> 03:05:21.279 align:start position:0%
that concludes my bill introduction
 
03:05:23.349 --> 03:05:23.359 align:start position:0%
madam chair i am happy to answer any

03:06:01.590 --> 03:06:01.600 align:start position:0%

as representative power said um
 
03:06:16.230 --> 03:06:16.240 align:start position:0%
this bill is i guess a little bit
 
03:06:18.469 --> 03:06:18.479 align:start position:0%
opposite of of the one we just heard we
 
03:06:20.710 --> 03:06:20.720 align:start position:0%
are talking about people that do have a
 
03:06:23.269 --> 03:06:23.279 align:start position:0%
license from another state that wish to
 
03:06:23.279 --> 03:06:24.870 align:start position:0%
license from another state that wish to
continue

03:06:24.870 --> 03:06:24.880 align:start position:0%
continue
 
03:06:26.870 --> 03:06:26.880 align:start position:0%
working in the profession that they've
 
03:06:28.790 --> 03:06:28.800 align:start position:0%
already been licensed in
 
03:06:29.990 --> 03:06:30.000 align:start position:0%
when you move to the state of new
 
03:06:30.000 --> 03:06:31.429 align:start position:0%
when you move to the state of new
hampshire

03:06:31.429 --> 03:06:31.439 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
03:06:32.950 --> 03:06:32.960 align:start position:0%
which is mentioned there are several
 
03:06:35.110 --> 03:06:35.120 align:start position:0%
obstacles that you have to overcome some
 
03:06:36.550 --> 03:06:36.560 align:start position:0%
of them
 
03:06:38.950 --> 03:06:38.960 align:start position:0%
are are not the fault of the person that
 
03:06:42.469 --> 03:06:42.479 align:start position:0%
holds the licensee at all as an example
 
03:06:44.710 --> 03:06:44.720 align:start position:0%
if you attend a cosmetology school that
 
03:06:44.720 --> 03:06:46.150 align:start position:0%
if you attend a cosmetology school that
closes

03:06:46.150 --> 03:06:46.160 align:start position:0%
closes
 
03:06:48.950 --> 03:06:48.960 align:start position:0%
you don't have the ability to
 
03:06:50.790 --> 03:06:50.800 align:start position:0%
to get the transcripts from that school
 
03:06:52.070 --> 03:06:52.080 align:start position:0%
that show that you went there and that
 
03:06:53.670 --> 03:06:53.680 align:start position:0%
is one of the requirements
 
03:06:54.790 --> 03:06:54.800 align:start position:0%
that the state of new hampshire
 
03:06:56.790 --> 03:06:56.800 align:start position:0%
currently has that you show in order to
 
03:06:59.190 --> 03:06:59.200 align:start position:0%
have reciprocity
 
03:07:01.269 --> 03:07:01.279 align:start position:0%
another obstacle is if you have a high
 
03:07:03.830 --> 03:07:03.840 align:start position:0%
school that closes a lot of schools are
 
03:07:05.750 --> 03:07:05.760 align:start position:0%
are forming regional school districts
 
03:07:07.030 --> 03:07:07.040 align:start position:0%
therefore a lot of high schools are
 
03:07:08.710 --> 03:07:08.720 align:start position:0%
closing if you're a person that just
 
03:07:09.750 --> 03:07:09.760 align:start position:0%
doesn't know where your high school
 
03:07:11.830 --> 03:07:11.840 align:start position:0%
diploma is
 
03:07:13.910 --> 03:07:13.920 align:start position:0%
you may not have the ability to get a
 
03:07:15.750 --> 03:07:15.760 align:start position:0%
copy of your high school transcripts or
 
03:07:18.150 --> 03:07:18.160 align:start position:0%
your diploma to show that you have that
 
03:07:20.790 --> 03:07:20.800 align:start position:0%
if you currently hold
 
03:07:23.190 --> 03:07:23.200 align:start position:0%
an actual current license from another
 
03:07:23.200 --> 03:07:24.550 align:start position:0%
an actual current license from another
state

03:07:24.550 --> 03:07:24.560 align:start position:0%
state
 
03:07:26.790 --> 03:07:26.800 align:start position:0%
your skills do not change when you move
 
03:07:28.469 --> 03:07:28.479 align:start position:0%
to the state of new hampshire you are
 
03:07:31.190 --> 03:07:31.200 align:start position:0%
not doing anything different
 
03:07:35.429 --> 03:07:35.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:37.429 --> 03:07:37.439 align:start position:0%
as was mentioned you still already have
 
03:07:39.670 --> 03:07:39.680 align:start position:0%
passed the test you've already proven
 
03:07:42.550 --> 03:07:42.560 align:start position:0%
yourself if you have a license and you
 
03:07:43.750 --> 03:07:43.760 align:start position:0%
are asked
 
03:07:45.110 --> 03:07:45.120 align:start position:0%
if you have a family member that is
 
03:07:47.110 --> 03:07:47.120 align:start position:0%
being transferred and you come to the
 
03:07:48.710 --> 03:07:48.720 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire and you don't
 
03:07:50.389 --> 03:07:50.399 align:start position:0%
have the required hours that new
 
03:07:53.590 --> 03:07:53.600 align:start position:0%
hampshire takes you have to show proof
 
03:07:55.670 --> 03:07:55.680 align:start position:0%
that you worked in a salon for x amount
 
03:07:56.950 --> 03:07:56.960 align:start position:0%
of hours
 
03:07:59.429 --> 03:07:59.439 align:start position:0%
or show that you have these skills
 
03:08:01.910 --> 03:08:01.920 align:start position:0%
that again that's that's an unnecessary
 
03:08:04.389 --> 03:08:04.399 align:start position:0%
obstacle when you graduate from school
 
03:08:05.990 --> 03:08:06.000 align:start position:0%
you get your current license and you go
 
03:08:07.910 --> 03:08:07.920 align:start position:0%
work they don't say wait
 
03:08:09.510 --> 03:08:09.520 align:start position:0%
you can't start working until you're an
 
03:08:11.510 --> 03:08:11.520 align:start position:0%
apprentice for so many hours
 
03:08:13.590 --> 03:08:13.600 align:start position:0%
so i strongly recommend
 
03:08:15.349 --> 03:08:15.359 align:start position:0%
that the committee ought to pass this
 
03:08:15.359 --> 03:08:17.750 align:start position:0%
that the committee ought to pass this
bill

03:08:17.750 --> 03:08:17.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:19.429 --> 03:08:19.439 align:start position:0%
as presented and i'll be happy to answer
 
03:08:21.349 --> 03:08:21.359 align:start position:0%

[Music]
 
03:08:39.590 --> 03:08:39.600 align:start position:0%
first question is um
 
03:08:41.750 --> 03:08:41.760 align:start position:0%
are there states where the requirements
 
03:08:43.830 --> 03:08:43.840 align:start position:0%
are much less than they are here in new
 
03:08:43.840 --> 03:08:45.510 align:start position:0%
are much less than they are here in new
hampshire

03:08:45.510 --> 03:08:45.520 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
03:08:47.269 --> 03:08:47.279 align:start position:0%
or ours
 
03:08:49.269 --> 03:08:49.279 align:start position:0%
make because i know we have a i heard
 
03:08:50.469 --> 03:08:50.479 align:start position:0%
several times
 
03:08:53.030 --> 03:08:53.040 align:start position:0%
that there's a 1500 hour requirement
 
03:08:55.429 --> 03:08:55.439 align:start position:0%
rather than a thousand but it's the
 
03:08:58.230 --> 03:08:58.240 align:start position:0%
cosmetology curriculum otherwise is it
 
03:08:59.830 --> 03:08:59.840 align:start position:0%
significantly tougher or is it about the
 
03:09:02.070 --> 03:09:02.080 align:start position:0%
same as other states
 
03:09:02.080 --> 03:09:03.910 align:start position:0%
same as other states
like

03:09:03.910 --> 03:09:03.920 align:start position:0%
like
 
03:09:05.269 --> 03:09:05.279 align:start position:0%
the the information that you're
 
03:09:07.269 --> 03:09:07.279 align:start position:0%
requesting is certainly available online
 
03:09:08.550 --> 03:09:08.560 align:start position:0%
i did have
 
03:09:10.710 --> 03:09:10.720 align:start position:0%
a list at one time of all the states and
 
03:09:12.389 --> 03:09:12.399 align:start position:0%
what they required i would say that new
 
03:09:14.309 --> 03:09:14.319 align:start position:0%
hampshire is probably somewhere in the
 
03:09:15.990 --> 03:09:16.000 align:start position:0%
middle of those some certainly require a
 
03:09:17.510 --> 03:09:17.520 align:start position:0%
lot more some certainly acquire a lot
 
03:09:19.590 --> 03:09:19.600 align:start position:0%
less the fact of the matter is the skill
 
03:09:21.190 --> 03:09:21.200 align:start position:0%
is still the same regardless of the
 
03:09:23.590 --> 03:09:23.600 align:start position:0%
state line representative
 
03:09:25.269 --> 03:09:25.279 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
03:09:27.429 --> 03:09:27.439 align:start position:0%
one follow-up
 
03:09:28.710 --> 03:09:28.720 align:start position:0%
yeah so
 
03:09:29.590 --> 03:09:29.600 align:start position:0%
i know
 
03:09:31.429 --> 03:09:31.439 align:start position:0%
colleges and universities when they shut
 
03:09:34.389 --> 03:09:34.399 align:start position:0%
down are required to transfer their uh
 
03:09:37.349 --> 03:09:37.359 align:start position:0%
their records to another institution as
 
03:09:39.269 --> 03:09:39.279 align:start position:0%
part of the shutdown process so that you
 
03:09:40.630 --> 03:09:40.640 align:start position:0%
know somebody can get their transcript
 
03:09:42.710 --> 03:09:42.720 align:start position:0%
is that to your knowledge uh
 
03:09:45.429 --> 03:09:45.439 align:start position:0%
not the same with professional schools
 
03:09:47.190 --> 03:09:47.200 align:start position:0%
such as beauty schools
 
03:09:48.309 --> 03:09:48.319 align:start position:0%
i don't own a beauty school
 
03:09:49.510 --> 03:09:49.520 align:start position:0%
representative i don't know the answer
 
03:09:51.830 --> 03:09:51.840 align:start position:0%
to your question okay
 
03:09:53.670 --> 03:09:53.680 align:start position:0%
all right thanks are there any other
 
03:09:57.269 --> 03:09:57.279 align:start position:0%
questions for representative rhodes
 
03:09:59.030 --> 03:09:59.040 align:start position:0%
seeing nand thank you very much thank
 
03:10:00.950 --> 03:10:00.960 align:start position:0%
you madam chair representative petrie

03:10:21.510 --> 03:10:21.520 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair uh thank you for
 
03:10:21.520 --> 03:10:22.229 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair uh thank you for
uh

03:10:22.229 --> 03:10:22.239 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:10:24.150 --> 03:10:24.160 align:start position:0%
let me testify here in front of the the
 
03:10:24.160 --> 03:10:27.349 align:start position:0%
let me testify here in front of the the
colleagues

03:10:27.349 --> 03:10:27.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:30.870 --> 03:10:30.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:34.469 --> 03:10:34.479 align:start position:0%
51 states have required 51 states 50
 
03:10:38.150 --> 03:10:38.160 align:start position:0%
states in d.c have the requirements
 
03:10:39.510 --> 03:10:39.520 align:start position:0%
the ones
 
03:10:41.670 --> 03:10:41.680 align:start position:0%
in my research i found that
 
03:10:44.229 --> 03:10:44.239 align:start position:0%
new york was a thousand hours versus our
 
03:10:48.150 --> 03:10:48.160 align:start position:0%
1500. i haven't seen any other or more
 
03:10:50.630 --> 03:10:50.640 align:start position:0%
than 1500.
 
03:10:50.640 --> 03:10:52.710 align:start position:0%
than 1500.
um

03:10:52.710 --> 03:10:52.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:10:55.349 --> 03:10:55.359 align:start position:0%
getting back to my wife
 
03:10:58.150 --> 03:10:58.160 align:start position:0%
she went to school in boston
 
03:10:59.830 --> 03:10:59.840 align:start position:0%
she knew she was going to need 1500
 
03:11:02.309 --> 03:11:02.319 align:start position:0%
hours in new hampshire so she
 
03:11:04.229 --> 03:11:04.239 align:start position:0%
went that route she worked a couple
 
03:11:05.269 --> 03:11:05.279 align:start position:0%
years in
 
03:11:05.279 --> 03:11:06.870 align:start position:0%
years in
massachusetts

03:11:06.870 --> 03:11:06.880 align:start position:0%
massachusetts
 
03:11:08.309 --> 03:11:08.319 align:start position:0%
when she transferred to new hampshire
 
03:11:10.389 --> 03:11:10.399 align:start position:0%
which is her home
 
03:11:11.590 --> 03:11:11.600 align:start position:0%
she uh
 
03:11:13.510 --> 03:11:13.520 align:start position:0%
she was required to take the practical
 
03:11:15.110 --> 03:11:15.120 align:start position:0%
you can go all through the
 
03:11:17.670 --> 03:11:17.680 align:start position:0%
hoops to get uh
 
03:11:20.830 --> 03:11:20.840 align:start position:0%
you know to get certified as a as a
 
03:11:22.630 --> 03:11:22.640 align:start position:0%
hairdresser or a beautician
 
03:11:24.309 --> 03:11:24.319 align:start position:0%
cosmetologist whatever you want to call
 
03:11:26.309 --> 03:11:26.319 align:start position:0%
her and
 
03:11:28.229 --> 03:11:28.239 align:start position:0%
you know that's that's quite a that's
 
03:11:30.469 --> 03:11:30.479 align:start position:0%
quite a load
 
03:11:32.469 --> 03:11:32.479 align:start position:0%
to have to go through that
 
03:11:32.479 --> 03:11:33.830 align:start position:0%
to have to go through that
again

03:11:33.830 --> 03:11:33.840 align:start position:0%
again
 
03:11:35.990 --> 03:11:36.000 align:start position:0%
when you should be able to just transfer
 
03:11:37.510 --> 03:11:37.520 align:start position:0%
when you get a driver's license in
 
03:11:39.750 --> 03:11:39.760 align:start position:0%
another state you just come to the state
 
03:11:41.910 --> 03:11:41.920 align:start position:0%
and if you've had one before
 
03:11:44.309 --> 03:11:44.319 align:start position:0%
there you go just like and another thing
 
03:11:46.790 --> 03:11:46.800 align:start position:0%
i don't know one thing i noticed
 
03:11:49.030 --> 03:11:49.040 align:start position:0%
come to mind i see these nurses come in
 
03:11:51.110 --> 03:11:51.120 align:start position:0%
and do their
 
03:11:53.190 --> 03:11:53.200 align:start position:0%
nursing here when uh during this
 
03:11:56.070 --> 03:11:56.080 align:start position:0%
pandemic here in manufact recently
 
03:11:58.469 --> 03:11:58.479 align:start position:0%
and i'm sure that they're
 
03:12:00.070 --> 03:12:00.080 align:start position:0%
i don't know if it was waived or
 
03:12:01.670 --> 03:12:01.680 align:start position:0%
whatever but that's
 
03:12:03.670 --> 03:12:03.680 align:start position:0%
that's pretty serious stuff
 
03:12:07.429 --> 03:12:07.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:09.750 --> 03:12:09.760 align:start position:0%
thank you representative petry
 
03:12:11.269 --> 03:12:11.279 align:start position:0%
i don't see any questions so thank you
 
03:12:12.950 --> 03:12:12.960 align:start position:0%
for your testimony
 
03:12:20.309 --> 03:12:20.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:21.910 --> 03:12:21.920 align:start position:0%
uh thank you chairman and members i'll
 
03:12:24.309 --> 03:12:24.319 align:start position:0%
be much shorter this time uh drew klein
 
03:12:26.229 --> 03:12:26.239 align:start position:0%
from the desire bartlett center
 
03:12:26.239 --> 03:12:27.190 align:start position:0%
from the desire bartlett center
um

03:12:27.190 --> 03:12:27.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:12:29.670 --> 03:12:29.680 align:start position:0%
so this bill is it would strip the
 
03:12:31.590 --> 03:12:31.600 align:start position:0%
equivalency language
 
03:12:33.429 --> 03:12:33.439 align:start position:0%
under these licenses and we think this
 
03:12:35.429 --> 03:12:35.439 align:start position:0%
language is subjective
 
03:12:37.750 --> 03:12:37.760 align:start position:0%
and not necessary new hampshire's in a
 
03:12:39.750 --> 03:12:39.760 align:start position:0%
pretty significant labor shortage right
 
03:12:39.760 --> 03:12:40.710 align:start position:0%
pretty significant labor shortage right
now

03:12:40.710 --> 03:12:40.720 align:start position:0%
now
 
03:12:43.110 --> 03:12:43.120 align:start position:0%
what we need are people to move here
 
03:12:43.120 --> 03:12:44.150 align:start position:0%
what we need are people to move here
and

03:12:44.150 --> 03:12:44.160 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:12:45.670 --> 03:12:45.680 align:start position:0%
this bill would do that in a way that
 
03:12:48.150 --> 03:12:48.160 align:start position:0%
does not compreh compromise health and
 
03:12:49.670 --> 03:12:49.680 align:start position:0%
safety in any way and just to give you
 
03:12:51.990 --> 03:12:52.000 align:start position:0%
some other examples um
 
03:12:53.750 --> 03:12:53.760 align:start position:0%
really quickly new hampshire for barbers
 
03:12:55.510 --> 03:12:55.520 align:start position:0%
new hampshire requires 800 hours of
 
03:12:57.910 --> 03:12:57.920 align:start position:0%
training in an approved school or 1600
 
03:12:59.830 --> 03:12:59.840 align:start position:0%
hours under a licensed barber that's
 
03:13:01.990 --> 03:13:02.000 align:start position:0%
actually very low compared to most other
 
03:13:04.630 --> 03:13:04.640 align:start position:0%
states for barber licenses we do very
 
03:13:04.640 --> 03:13:05.429 align:start position:0%
states for barber licenses we do very
well

03:13:05.429 --> 03:13:05.439 align:start position:0%
well
 
03:13:05.439 --> 03:13:06.469 align:start position:0%
well
um

03:13:06.469 --> 03:13:06.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:13:08.389 --> 03:13:08.399 align:start position:0%
from vermont maine and mass require a
 
03:13:10.229 --> 03:13:10.239 align:start position:0%
thousand hours connecticut rhode island
 
03:13:11.910 --> 03:13:11.920 align:start position:0%
core 1500
 
03:13:13.670 --> 03:13:13.680 align:start position:0%
there are only a few states that have
 
03:13:15.670 --> 03:13:15.680 align:start position:0%
lower requirements
 
03:13:18.389 --> 03:13:18.399 align:start position:0%
oregon for example requires 746 hours of
 
03:13:18.399 --> 03:13:20.469 align:start position:0%
oregon for example requires 746 hours of
training

03:13:20.469 --> 03:13:20.479 align:start position:0%
training
 
03:13:23.910 --> 03:13:23.920 align:start position:0%
with the subjective language in there
 
03:13:26.469 --> 03:13:26.479 align:start position:0%
making it substantial equivalent
 
03:13:28.070 --> 03:13:28.080 align:start position:0%
it's not going to compromise the health
 
03:13:30.389 --> 03:13:30.399 align:start position:0%
or safety you know in barbering um for
 
03:13:32.469 --> 03:13:32.479 align:start position:0%
cosmetology the folks behind me will
 
03:13:34.389 --> 03:13:34.399 align:start position:0%
have more robust numbers but we're not
 
03:13:36.550 --> 03:13:36.560 align:start position:0%
that far off so it's not like we're
 
03:13:38.630 --> 03:13:38.640 align:start position:0%
lowering standards with this bill what
 
03:13:40.870 --> 03:13:40.880 align:start position:0%
we're doing is just making it easier for
 
03:13:42.469 --> 03:13:42.479 align:start position:0%
people to immediately get into new
 
03:13:45.349 --> 03:13:45.359 align:start position:0%
hampshire without additional hurdles
 
03:13:47.590 --> 03:13:47.600 align:start position:0%
that's all thank you mr klein are there
 
03:13:47.600 --> 03:13:49.269 align:start position:0%
that's all thank you mr klein are there
questions

03:13:49.269 --> 03:13:49.279 align:start position:0%
questions
 
03:13:52.070 --> 03:13:52.080 align:start position:0%
representative scitec
 
03:13:54.229 --> 03:13:54.239 align:start position:0%
mr klein uh you said you're not lowering
 
03:13:57.190 --> 03:13:57.200 align:start position:0%
standards but if if the requirements are
 
03:13:59.670 --> 03:13:59.680 align:start position:0%
1500 here and a thousand
 
03:14:02.150 --> 03:14:02.160 align:start position:0%
elsewhere haven't you exactly done that
 
03:14:04.229 --> 03:14:04.239 align:start position:0%
lowered the standards
 
03:14:05.990 --> 03:14:06.000 align:start position:0%
we don't think
 
03:14:08.870 --> 03:14:08.880 align:start position:0%
so in the sense that
 
03:14:11.349 --> 03:14:11.359 align:start position:0%
the qualifications that you're doing
 
03:14:13.670 --> 03:14:13.680 align:start position:0%
with these hours um
 
03:14:13.680 --> 03:14:15.510 align:start position:0%
with these hours um
are

03:14:15.510 --> 03:14:15.520 align:start position:0%
are
 
03:14:17.269 --> 03:14:17.279 align:start position:0%
somewhat arbitrary
 
03:14:18.790 --> 03:14:18.800 align:start position:0%
there are new hampshire used to have a
 
03:14:20.630 --> 03:14:20.640 align:start position:0%
two thousand hour license requirement
 
03:14:22.469 --> 03:14:22.479 align:start position:0%
for cosmetologists now we're down to
 
03:14:25.190 --> 03:14:25.200 align:start position:0%
fifteen hundred mass has a thousand lots
 
03:14:26.790 --> 03:14:26.800 align:start position:0%
of other states
 
03:14:29.190 --> 03:14:29.200 align:start position:0%
have different numbers and we haven't
 
03:14:30.790 --> 03:14:30.800 align:start position:0%
seen any data
 
03:14:32.950 --> 03:14:32.960 align:start position:0%
that actually
 
03:14:35.830 --> 03:14:35.840 align:start position:0%
shows a significant increase in public
 
03:14:37.190 --> 03:14:37.200 align:start position:0%
health or safety
 
03:14:38.950 --> 03:14:38.960 align:start position:0%
when you increase these hours a little
 
03:14:41.830 --> 03:14:41.840 align:start position:0%
bit so we don't think there's any danger
 
03:14:44.070 --> 03:14:44.080 align:start position:0%
to the public because you might have
 
03:14:46.309 --> 03:14:46.319 align:start position:0%
somebody come in from a state that has a
 
03:14:46.319 --> 03:14:47.030 align:start position:0%
somebody come in from a state that has a
few

03:14:47.030 --> 03:14:47.040 align:start position:0%
few
 
03:14:49.190 --> 03:14:49.200 align:start position:0%
you know 100 hours less in training we
 
03:14:51.429 --> 03:14:51.439 align:start position:0%
just haven't seen no relationship there
 
03:14:53.349 --> 03:14:53.359 align:start position:0%
between the number of hours and the
 
03:14:57.750 --> 03:14:57.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:59.030 --> 03:14:59.040 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
03:15:02.229 --> 03:15:02.239 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much
 
03:15:12.630 --> 03:15:12.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:15.030 --> 03:15:15.040 align:start position:0%
good what i believe is now afternoon
 
03:15:17.190 --> 03:15:17.200 align:start position:0%
members of the executive departments and
 
03:15:19.110 --> 03:15:19.120 align:start position:0%
administrative committee thank you for
 
03:15:21.269 --> 03:15:21.279 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to testify in support of
 
03:15:23.830 --> 03:15:23.840 align:start position:0%
house bill 1560 which would allow the
 
03:15:25.590 --> 03:15:25.600 align:start position:0%
new hampshire board of barbering
 
03:15:27.990 --> 03:15:28.000 align:start position:0%
cosmetology and aesthetics to recognize
 
03:15:29.990 --> 03:15:30.000 align:start position:0%
more quickly out of state beauty
 
03:15:32.950 --> 03:15:32.960 align:start position:0%
industry professional licenses
 
03:15:35.429 --> 03:15:35.439 align:start position:0%
all 50 states require cosmetologists
 
03:15:38.150 --> 03:15:38.160 align:start position:0%
barbers and estheticians to be licensed
 
03:15:40.309 --> 03:15:40.319 align:start position:0%
every state's beauty school curriculum
 
03:15:41.590 --> 03:15:41.600 align:start position:0%
beauty practitioner skills and
 
03:15:43.590 --> 03:15:43.600 align:start position:0%
techniques and beauty services are
 
03:15:45.510 --> 03:15:45.520 align:start position:0%
nearly identical despite those
 
03:15:47.429 --> 03:15:47.439 align:start position:0%
similarities it is difficult to have an
 
03:15:49.670 --> 03:15:49.680 align:start position:0%
out-of-state beauty license recognized
 
03:15:51.269 --> 03:15:51.279 align:start position:0%
to be able to be recognized in new
 
03:15:51.279 --> 03:15:52.389 align:start position:0%
to be able to be recognized in new
hampshire

03:15:52.389 --> 03:15:52.399 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
03:15:54.070 --> 03:15:54.080 align:start position:0%
that's because new hampshire requires
 
03:15:56.229 --> 03:15:56.239 align:start position:0%
out-of-state beauty license requirements
 
03:15:58.309 --> 03:15:58.319 align:start position:0%
to be substantially equivalent or higher
 
03:16:00.469 --> 03:16:00.479 align:start position:0%
than those of new hampshire's license
 
03:16:02.630 --> 03:16:02.640 align:start position:0%
the arbitrary recognition requirement
 
03:16:04.790 --> 03:16:04.800 align:start position:0%
restricts the mobility of licensees
 
03:16:05.990 --> 03:16:06.000 align:start position:0%
which is a problem for beauty
 
03:16:07.590 --> 03:16:07.600 align:start position:0%
professionals and employers throughout
 
03:16:08.710 --> 03:16:08.720 align:start position:0%
the state
 
03:16:10.469 --> 03:16:10.479 align:start position:0%
i encourage this committee to support
 
03:16:13.030 --> 03:16:13.040 align:start position:0%
house bill 1560 because reducing
 
03:16:14.469 --> 03:16:14.479 align:start position:0%
licensing barriers creates more
 
03:16:15.910 --> 03:16:15.920 align:start position:0%

hampshire
 
03:16:19.510 --> 03:16:19.520 align:start position:0%
first licensing mobility is exceedingly
 
03:16:21.590 --> 03:16:21.600 align:start position:0%
important employers across the country
 
03:16:23.910 --> 03:16:23.920 align:start position:0%
are experiencing labor shortages making
 
03:16:25.590 --> 03:16:25.600 align:start position:0%
it easier for licensed beauty
 
03:16:27.510 --> 03:16:27.520 align:start position:0%
professionals to work by reducing
 
03:16:29.590 --> 03:16:29.600 align:start position:0%
barriers will allow employers to have a
 
03:16:32.710 --> 03:16:32.720 align:start position:0%
wider pool of potential applicants
 
03:16:35.190 --> 03:16:35.200 align:start position:0%
second the substantially equivalent or
 
03:16:37.910 --> 03:16:37.920 align:start position:0%
higher than requirement is vague
 
03:16:39.910 --> 03:16:39.920 align:start position:0%
it creates a chilling effect for
 
03:16:42.070 --> 03:16:42.080 align:start position:0%
for perfect for potential beauty
 
03:16:43.910 --> 03:16:43.920 align:start position:0%
professionals who may have an interest
 
03:16:45.910 --> 03:16:45.920 align:start position:0%
in working in new hampshire
 
03:16:47.510 --> 03:16:47.520 align:start position:0%
qualified beauty professionals may
 
03:16:49.349 --> 03:16:49.359 align:start position:0%
choose to not bring their skills to new
 
03:16:51.269 --> 03:16:51.279 align:start position:0%
hampshire for fear of having to undergo
 
03:16:53.190 --> 03:16:53.200 align:start position:0%
additional costly and time-consuming
 
03:16:53.200 --> 03:16:54.469 align:start position:0%

03:16:54.469 --> 03:16:54.479 align:start position:0%

03:16:56.870 --> 03:16:56.880 align:start position:0%
third this bill helps to empower women
 
03:16:58.870 --> 03:16:58.880 align:start position:0%
the largest group of beneficiaries of
 
03:17:00.550 --> 03:17:00.560 align:start position:0%
this bill are beauty professionals who
 
03:17:02.710 --> 03:17:02.720 align:start position:0%
have a spouse with a job that that
 
03:17:05.190 --> 03:17:05.200 align:start position:0%
requires frequent interstate travel
 
03:17:06.870 --> 03:17:06.880 align:start position:0%
most beauty service professionals are
 
03:17:08.469 --> 03:17:08.479 align:start position:0%
women and beauty service skills are
 
03:17:10.630 --> 03:17:10.640 align:start position:0%
easily transferable from state to state
 
03:17:12.309 --> 03:17:12.319 align:start position:0%
making this industry an attractive
 
03:17:14.229 --> 03:17:14.239 align:start position:0%
choice for women who want to continue to
 
03:17:16.229 --> 03:17:16.239 align:start position:0%
support their families while also
 
03:17:18.150 --> 03:17:18.160 align:start position:0%
advancing their careers
 
03:17:20.309 --> 03:17:20.319 align:start position:0%
however the time that it takes to have
 
03:17:23.190 --> 03:17:23.200 align:start position:0%
this quality determination of a beauty
 
03:17:24.870 --> 03:17:24.880 align:start position:0%
license for these professionals means
 
03:17:26.469 --> 03:17:26.479 align:start position:0%
that these women are out of work because
 
03:17:28.550 --> 03:17:28.560 align:start position:0%
of needless bureaucracy which leaves
 
03:17:31.269 --> 03:17:31.279 align:start position:0%
their career their careers to stagnate
 
03:17:32.950 --> 03:17:32.960 align:start position:0%
this bill helps to get these women into
 
03:17:34.630 --> 03:17:34.640 align:start position:0%
work sooner to support their families
 
03:17:37.110 --> 03:17:37.120 align:start position:0%
and to continue to advance their careers
 
03:17:39.590 --> 03:17:39.600 align:start position:0%
house bill 1560 makes small changes to
 
03:17:41.670 --> 03:17:41.680 align:start position:0%
the law that will have large impacts on
 
03:17:43.269 --> 03:17:43.279 align:start position:0%
beauty professionals who may want to
 
03:17:44.630 --> 03:17:44.640 align:start position:0%
bring their skills knowledge and
 
03:17:47.110 --> 03:17:47.120 align:start position:0%
experience to benefit the new
 
03:17:50.070 --> 03:17:50.080 align:start position:0%
new hampshire's beauty industry
 
03:17:51.590 --> 03:17:51.600 align:start position:0%
in conclusion i would encourage this
 
03:17:53.990 --> 03:17:54.000 align:start position:0%
committee to support house bill 1560 so
 
03:17:55.590 --> 03:17:55.600 align:start position:0%
that skilled beauty professionals can
 
03:17:57.590 --> 03:17:57.600 align:start position:0%
bring their talents and skills here
 
03:17:59.910 --> 03:17:59.920 align:start position:0%
these individuals hold a current valid
 
03:18:01.750 --> 03:18:01.760 align:start position:0%
license and have and have been through
 
03:18:03.670 --> 03:18:03.680 align:start position:0%
beauty school and they are ready and
 
03:18:05.510 --> 03:18:05.520 align:start position:0%
willing to work in the state thank you
 
03:18:07.349 --> 03:18:07.359 align:start position:0%
for the opportunity to testify and i'm
 
03:18:08.790 --> 03:18:08.800 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions that you
 
03:18:12.950 --> 03:18:12.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:14.150 --> 03:18:14.160 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:18:16.950 --> 03:18:16.960 align:start position:0%
representative goalie
 
03:18:18.469 --> 03:18:18.479 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you for
 
03:18:19.910 --> 03:18:19.920 align:start position:0%
taking the question
 
03:18:22.790 --> 03:18:22.800 align:start position:0%
we heard an earlier testimony that
 
03:18:24.150 --> 03:18:24.160 align:start position:0%
there are
 
03:18:26.550 --> 03:18:26.560 align:start position:0%
individuals coming to new hampshire from
 
03:18:30.309 --> 03:18:30.319 align:start position:0%
massachusetts for a 1500 hour class when
 
03:18:31.429 --> 03:18:31.439 align:start position:0%
it's only a thousand hours in
 
03:18:31.439 --> 03:18:33.510 align:start position:0%
it's only a thousand hours in
massachusetts

03:18:33.510 --> 03:18:33.520 align:start position:0%
massachusetts
 
03:18:35.190 --> 03:18:35.200 align:start position:0%
how would you state that that's over
 
03:18:36.710 --> 03:18:36.720 align:start position:0%
burdensome if they're coming here for
 
03:18:38.229 --> 03:18:38.239 align:start position:0%
the extra hours knowing that they're
 
03:18:40.150 --> 03:18:40.160 align:start position:0%
getting a better education and better
 
03:18:43.190 --> 03:18:43.200 align:start position:0%
qualified to do what they're doing
 
03:18:45.429 --> 03:18:45.439 align:start position:0%
well so anecdotally
 
03:18:47.269 --> 03:18:47.279 align:start position:0%
she shared that there are individuals
 
03:18:49.429 --> 03:18:49.439 align:start position:0%
who are coming from massachusetts to new
 
03:18:49.439 --> 03:18:50.710 align:start position:0%
who are coming from massachusetts to new
hampshire

03:18:50.710 --> 03:18:50.720 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
03:18:52.710 --> 03:18:52.720 align:start position:0%
but we also can say that there are many
 
03:18:54.469 --> 03:18:54.479 align:start position:0%
individuals in massachusetts who are
 
03:18:55.990 --> 03:18:56.000 align:start position:0%
going who are undergoing the thousand
 
03:18:57.429 --> 03:18:57.439 align:start position:0%
hours of training so it's really a
 
03:19:00.070 --> 03:19:00.080 align:start position:0%
personal choice and and if someone feels
 
03:19:02.070 --> 03:19:02.080 align:start position:0%
the need to spend that extra time and
 
03:19:03.910 --> 03:19:03.920 align:start position:0%
would like to spend that extra time to
 
03:19:05.429 --> 03:19:05.439 align:start position:0%
get that additional training because not
 
03:19:06.950 --> 03:19:06.960 align:start position:0%
all beauty service professionals are the
 
03:19:08.790 --> 03:19:08.800 align:start position:0%
same right some people
 
03:19:11.030 --> 03:19:11.040 align:start position:0%
do train outside of a traditional
 
03:19:12.870 --> 03:19:12.880 align:start position:0%
classroom and so they need to
 
03:19:15.269 --> 03:19:15.279 align:start position:0%
they want to train at it at a more
 
03:19:17.190 --> 03:19:17.200 align:start position:0%
advanced level some people need to
 
03:19:18.630 --> 03:19:18.640 align:start position:0%
continue to
 
03:19:20.469 --> 03:19:20.479 align:start position:0%
work on the foundational skills and so
 
03:19:21.990 --> 03:19:22.000 align:start position:0%
maybe that's why those individuals are
 
03:19:23.349 --> 03:19:23.359 align:start position:0%
coming into new hampshire to get that
 
03:19:26.550 --> 03:19:26.560 align:start position:0%
extra 500 hours of training
 
03:19:29.910 --> 03:19:29.920 align:start position:0%
so i can't speak to exactly why every
 
03:19:31.590 --> 03:19:31.600 align:start position:0%
you know why every single individual
 
03:19:33.110 --> 03:19:33.120 align:start position:0%
chooses to come to new hampshire but it
 
03:19:35.269 --> 03:19:35.279 align:start position:0%
certainly is a is a personal choice um
 
03:19:37.030 --> 03:19:37.040 align:start position:0%
but we do know that states across the
 
03:19:39.110 --> 03:19:39.120 align:start position:0%
country are lowering their hours
 
03:19:41.190 --> 03:19:41.200 align:start position:0%
requirements and beauty professionals
 
03:19:42.950 --> 03:19:42.960 align:start position:0%
are taking note and are excited about
 
03:19:45.269 --> 03:19:45.279 align:start position:0%
those opportunities because they choose
 
03:19:47.349 --> 03:19:47.359 align:start position:0%
and they don't want to spend
 
03:19:49.349 --> 03:19:49.359 align:start position:0%
a substantial amount of money on
 
03:19:51.030 --> 03:19:51.040 align:start position:0%
traditional cosmetology school training
 
03:19:55.269 --> 03:19:55.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:57.510 --> 03:19:57.520 align:start position:0%
and just to follow up on
 
03:19:59.349 --> 03:19:59.359 align:start position:0%
as we talk about massachusetts well it's
 
03:20:01.110 --> 03:20:01.120 align:start position:0%
a thousand hours is it not true that
 
03:20:02.630 --> 03:20:02.640 align:start position:0%
they also have to do some hours after
 
03:20:04.309 --> 03:20:04.319 align:start position:0%
that in the field and do you know how
 
03:20:07.110 --> 03:20:07.120 align:start position:0%
many hours it is for training afterwards
 
03:20:09.510 --> 03:20:09.520 align:start position:0%
yes so statutorily in massachusetts
 
03:20:11.190 --> 03:20:11.200 align:start position:0%
there's only a thousand hour training
 
03:20:13.269 --> 03:20:13.279 align:start position:0%
requirement but what you'll find across
 
03:20:15.030 --> 03:20:15.040 align:start position:0%
the country and with many beauty
 
03:20:17.910 --> 03:20:17.920 align:start position:0%
professionals is that they want to do
 
03:20:19.510 --> 03:20:19.520 align:start position:0%
additional training to learn their
 
03:20:21.910 --> 03:20:21.920 align:start position:0%
specialty skill and so even though they
 
03:20:23.750 --> 03:20:23.760 align:start position:0%
graduate with this cosmetology degree
 
03:20:24.950 --> 03:20:24.960 align:start position:0%
and they have their license because
 
03:20:26.630 --> 03:20:26.640 align:start position:0%
that's what's required they want to
 
03:20:28.070 --> 03:20:28.080 align:start position:0%
specialize in what they're doing so they
 
03:20:29.510 --> 03:20:29.520 align:start position:0%
go and they get you know the makeup
 
03:20:30.950 --> 03:20:30.960 align:start position:0%
certification they go and get the
 
03:20:33.429 --> 03:20:33.439 align:start position:0%
eyelash certification and we're we're
 
03:20:35.590 --> 03:20:35.600 align:start position:0%
totally for that we want everyone to be
 
03:20:36.950 --> 03:20:36.960 align:start position:0%
trained we want you to feel very
 
03:20:39.429 --> 03:20:39.439 align:start position:0%
comfortable in your educational skills
 
03:20:40.790 --> 03:20:40.800 align:start position:0%
um in
 
03:20:42.309 --> 03:20:42.319 align:start position:0%
your education and the skills that you
 
03:20:44.870 --> 03:20:44.880 align:start position:0%
provide it's just what we what we know
 
03:20:47.590 --> 03:20:47.600 align:start position:0%
is that the state mandated license
 
03:20:49.750 --> 03:20:49.760 align:start position:0%
requirement means very little to
 
03:20:52.229 --> 03:20:52.239 align:start position:0%
consumers and it also is a huge barrier
 
03:20:54.229 --> 03:20:54.239 align:start position:0%
um for professionals who want to get to
 
03:20:57.190 --> 03:20:57.200 align:start position:0%
work quickly
 
03:20:58.710 --> 03:20:58.720 align:start position:0%
other questions from the committee
 
03:20:58.720 --> 03:21:01.269 align:start position:0%
other questions from the committee
representative

03:21:01.269 --> 03:21:01.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:05.429 --> 03:21:05.439 align:start position:0%
did you state in your testimony that
 
03:21:08.630 --> 03:21:08.640 align:start position:0%
a majority of the women
 
03:21:10.630 --> 03:21:10.640 align:start position:0%
who are who could benefit from this
 
03:21:12.550 --> 03:21:12.560 align:start position:0%
allies license
 
03:21:16.389 --> 03:21:16.399 align:start position:0%
have husbands who do interstate travel
 
03:21:18.870 --> 03:21:18.880 align:start position:0%
yes that would be a large group of of
 
03:21:20.469 --> 03:21:20.479 align:start position:0%
individuals who would be able to benefit
 
03:21:23.110 --> 03:21:23.120 align:start position:0%
from this from the spill so um if if
 
03:21:26.229 --> 03:21:26.239 align:start position:0%
you're thinking of someone um who has um
 
03:21:27.429 --> 03:21:27.439 align:start position:0%
who's a spouse of someone in the
 
03:21:29.990 --> 03:21:30.000 align:start position:0%
military um they would be more able or
 
03:21:31.670 --> 03:21:31.680 align:start position:0%
more quickly able to have their their
 
03:21:33.429 --> 03:21:33.439 align:start position:0%
license recognized and be able to get to
 
03:21:35.830 --> 03:21:35.840 align:start position:0%

hampshire if the bill were to be enacted

03:21:44.950 --> 03:21:44.960 align:start position:0%
it seems rather a tiny portion of the
 
03:21:47.830 --> 03:21:47.840 align:start position:0%
when you say a large portion it doesn't
 
03:21:49.510 --> 03:21:49.520 align:start position:0%

03:23:22.870 --> 03:23:22.880 align:start position:0%
the one o'clock hearing from house bill

to 1 25
 
03:23:31.670 --> 03:23:31.680 align:start position:0%

04:30:35.269 --> 04:30:35.279 align:start position:0%
i have for a number of years been
 
04:30:37.110 --> 04:30:37.120 align:start position:0%
trying to
 
04:30:41.990 --> 04:30:42.000 align:start position:0%
see how to address or have addressed
 
04:30:44.389 --> 04:30:44.399 align:start position:0%
daylight savings times issues
 
04:30:48.229 --> 04:30:48.239 align:start position:0%
and the ramifications of those issues
 
04:30:50.870 --> 04:30:50.880 align:start position:0%
including the loss of sleep and the
 
04:30:52.950 --> 04:30:52.960 align:start position:0%
danger and
 
04:30:55.269 --> 04:30:55.279 align:start position:0%
the health
 
04:30:55.279 --> 04:30:56.389 align:start position:0%
the health
effects

04:30:56.389 --> 04:30:56.399 align:start position:0%
effects
 
04:30:58.389 --> 04:30:58.399 align:start position:0%
of those loss of sleep
 
04:31:01.590 --> 04:31:01.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:04.790 --> 04:31:04.800 align:start position:0%
a lot of the opposition to that
 
04:31:04.800 --> 04:31:06.630 align:start position:0%
a lot of the opposition to that
legislation

04:31:06.630 --> 04:31:06.640 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
04:31:09.590 --> 04:31:09.600 align:start position:0%
is that there
 
04:31:12.469 --> 04:31:12.479 align:start position:0%
should be a federal solution
 
04:31:13.670 --> 04:31:13.680 align:start position:0%
and so
 
04:31:15.830 --> 04:31:15.840 align:start position:0%
what i'm proposing
 
04:31:17.510 --> 04:31:17.520 align:start position:0%
to you today
 
04:31:21.110 --> 04:31:21.120 align:start position:0%
is not only should we bring awareness
 
04:31:24.070 --> 04:31:24.080 align:start position:0%
about the dangers of the lack of sleep
 
04:31:24.080 --> 04:31:25.189 align:start position:0%
about the dangers of the lack of sleep
because

04:31:25.189 --> 04:31:25.199 align:start position:0%
because
 
04:31:27.269 --> 04:31:27.279 align:start position:0%
they are
 
04:31:32.710 --> 04:31:32.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:32.720 --> 04:31:34.550 align:start position:0%
 
and

04:31:34.550 --> 04:31:34.560 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:31:37.510 --> 04:31:37.520 align:start position:0%
also take the opportunity to
 
04:31:39.429 --> 04:31:39.439 align:start position:0%
request that our
 
04:31:41.990 --> 04:31:42.000 align:start position:0%
federal representatives address this
 
04:31:42.000 --> 04:31:44.229 align:start position:0%
federal representatives address this
issue

04:31:44.229 --> 04:31:44.239 align:start position:0%
issue
 
04:31:46.229 --> 04:31:46.239 align:start position:0%
post haste
 
04:31:46.239 --> 04:31:48.229 align:start position:0%
post haste
and

04:31:48.229 --> 04:31:48.239 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:31:51.349 --> 04:31:51.359 align:start position:0%
so i tried to do
 
04:31:53.750 --> 04:31:53.760 align:start position:0%
two birds kind of with one stone as long
 
04:31:57.349 --> 04:31:57.359 align:start position:0%
as we're having days and um
 
04:32:00.070 --> 04:32:00.080 align:start position:0%
months and weeks that we recognize and
 
04:32:02.389 --> 04:32:02.399 align:start position:0%
try and bring attention to issues i
 
04:32:04.229 --> 04:32:04.239 align:start position:0%
think that um
 
04:32:04.239 --> 04:32:05.349 align:start position:0%
think that um
sleep

04:32:05.349 --> 04:32:05.359 align:start position:0%
sleep
 
04:32:09.670 --> 04:32:09.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:13.269 --> 04:32:13.279 align:start position:0%
of it on health and safety
 
04:32:13.279 --> 04:32:15.910 align:start position:0%
of it on health and safety
is

04:32:15.910 --> 04:32:15.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:18.309 --> 04:32:18.319 align:start position:0%
hard to understate
 
04:32:20.550 --> 04:32:20.560 align:start position:0%
based on the evidence that we have thus
 
04:32:20.560 --> 04:32:21.429 align:start position:0%
based on the evidence that we have thus
far

04:32:21.429 --> 04:32:21.439 align:start position:0%
far
 
04:32:24.389 --> 04:32:24.399 align:start position:0%
and i'm happy to um
 
04:32:26.229 --> 04:32:26.239 align:start position:0%
uh point you to
 
04:32:29.349 --> 04:32:29.359 align:start position:0%
um the sleep national sleep associate
 
04:32:29.359 --> 04:32:30.870 align:start position:0%
um the sleep national sleep associate
foundation

04:32:30.870 --> 04:32:30.880 align:start position:0%
foundation
 
04:32:34.870 --> 04:32:34.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:37.510 --> 04:32:37.520 align:start position:0%
other such places that house research on
 
04:32:40.389 --> 04:32:40.399 align:start position:0%
that if if the there is questions about
 
04:32:43.110 --> 04:32:43.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:44.790 --> 04:32:44.800 align:start position:0%
the effects of
 
04:32:48.790 --> 04:32:48.800 align:start position:0%
how how how important the the
 
04:32:52.309 --> 04:32:52.319 align:start position:0%
sleep can affect everything from
 
04:32:55.670 --> 04:32:55.680 align:start position:0%
diabetes to obesity to
 
04:32:59.030 --> 04:32:59.040 align:start position:0%
potentially even alzheimer's and cancer
 
04:33:02.630 --> 04:33:02.640 align:start position:0%
and so this is um
 
04:33:05.269 --> 04:33:05.279 align:start position:0%
i've i believe a very important thing
 
04:33:08.070 --> 04:33:08.080 align:start position:0%
that we need brought awareness to
 
04:33:08.080 --> 04:33:10.310 align:start position:0%
that we need brought awareness to
and

04:33:10.310 --> 04:33:10.320 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:33:13.109 --> 04:33:13.119 align:start position:0%
i understand from conversations with
 
04:33:15.109 --> 04:33:15.119 align:start position:0%
committee members that they are not in
 
04:33:17.670 --> 04:33:17.680 align:start position:0%
super big favor of having days and weeks
 
04:33:19.590 --> 04:33:19.600 align:start position:0%
and proclamations and
 
04:33:21.750 --> 04:33:21.760 align:start position:0%
all of that um but as long as we're
 
04:33:23.189 --> 04:33:23.199 align:start position:0%
doing it
 
04:33:25.510 --> 04:33:25.520 align:start position:0%
until we repeal all of that i think that
 
04:33:25.520 --> 04:33:26.470 align:start position:0%
until we repeal all of that i think that
um

04:33:26.470 --> 04:33:26.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:33:30.230 --> 04:33:30.240 align:start position:0%
this topic is one that deserves the
 
04:33:32.629 --> 04:33:32.639 align:start position:0%
committee's attention and so with that
 
04:33:34.949 --> 04:33:34.959 align:start position:0%
i'm happy to answer any questions
 
04:33:37.029 --> 04:33:37.039 align:start position:0%
thank you representative representative
 
04:33:39.349 --> 04:33:39.359 align:start position:0%
seitek has a question
 
04:33:41.830 --> 04:33:41.840 align:start position:0%
did i hear you say that it's
 
04:33:43.910 --> 04:33:43.920 align:start position:0%
hard to understate the importance of
 
04:33:43.920 --> 04:33:44.869 align:start position:0%
hard to understate the importance of
this

04:33:44.869 --> 04:33:44.879 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:33:47.590 --> 04:33:47.600 align:start position:0%
of sleep yeah
 
04:33:49.990 --> 04:33:50.000 align:start position:0%
yes it sounded like you said that right
 
04:33:53.910 --> 04:33:53.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:56.070 --> 04:33:56.080 align:start position:0%
it's thank you representative scitec for
 
04:33:59.590 --> 04:33:59.600 align:start position:0%
that useful comment representative marsh
 
04:34:01.029 --> 04:34:01.039 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chairman thank you
 
04:34:03.269 --> 04:34:03.279 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question uh
 
04:34:06.310 --> 04:34:06.320 align:start position:0%
does the national sleep foundation have
 
04:34:09.189 --> 04:34:09.199 align:start position:0%
a position on uh the adoption of
 
04:34:10.629 --> 04:34:10.639 align:start position:0%
atlantic standard time or permanent
 
04:34:12.709 --> 04:34:12.719 align:start position:0%
daily savings time
 
04:34:13.990 --> 04:34:14.000 align:start position:0%
or not
 
04:34:14.000 --> 04:34:15.269 align:start position:0%
or not
yes

04:34:15.269 --> 04:34:15.279 align:start position:0%
yes
 
04:34:19.670 --> 04:34:19.680 align:start position:0%
so so they actually are the ones
 
04:34:23.349 --> 04:34:23.359 align:start position:0%
they launched back in 1998
 
04:34:27.109 --> 04:34:27.119 align:start position:0%
a sleep awareness program and
 
04:34:28.551 --> 04:34:28.561 align:start position:0%
they do
 
04:34:33.109 --> 04:34:33.119 align:start position:0%
uh suggest the adoption of us
 
04:34:34.949 --> 04:34:34.959 align:start position:0%
a time which does not
 
04:34:36.789 --> 04:34:36.799 align:start position:0%
fluctuate throughout the year so that we
 
04:34:39.109 --> 04:34:39.119 align:start position:0%
can have the um thank you for that yeah
 
04:34:41.830 --> 04:34:41.840 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:34:43.990 --> 04:34:44.000 align:start position:0%
other questions representative schuett
 
04:34:45.750 --> 04:34:45.760 align:start position:0%
and then
 
04:34:47.990 --> 04:34:48.000 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
04:34:50.869 --> 04:34:50.879 align:start position:0%
representative um it seems that the
 
04:34:52.390 --> 04:34:52.400 align:start position:0%
major thrust
 
04:34:54.629 --> 04:34:54.639 align:start position:0%
of what you're doing here is to
 
04:34:56.310 --> 04:34:56.320 align:start position:0%
send a message
 
04:34:57.510 --> 04:34:57.520 align:start position:0%
to the u.s
 
04:34:59.830 --> 04:34:59.840 align:start position:0%
congress and senate
 
04:35:02.070 --> 04:35:02.080 align:start position:0%
i'm reading that language that you want
 
04:35:04.629 --> 04:35:04.639 align:start position:0%
the governor to address the issue to
 
04:35:07.670 --> 04:35:07.680 align:start position:0%
them why wouldn't you just
 
04:35:10.310 --> 04:35:10.320 align:start position:0%
introduce a resolution which would send
 
04:35:13.189 --> 04:35:13.199 align:start position:0%
a message from our whole legislature
 
04:35:15.590 --> 04:35:15.600 align:start position:0%
to the delegation
 
04:35:17.830 --> 04:35:17.840 align:start position:0%
which seems to me a more proper way than
 
04:35:21.109 --> 04:35:21.119 align:start position:0%
putting something in statute
 
04:35:22.551 --> 04:35:22.561 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
04:35:24.629 --> 04:35:24.639 align:start position:0%
um as i stated i think that bringing
 
04:35:26.551 --> 04:35:26.561 align:start position:0%
awareness to this issue is a is an
 
04:35:29.910 --> 04:35:29.920 align:start position:0%
important one in general and also
 
04:35:29.920 --> 04:35:31.750 align:start position:0%
important one in general and also
um

04:35:31.750 --> 04:35:31.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:35:31.760 --> 04:35:32.551 align:start position:0%
um
the

04:35:32.551 --> 04:35:32.561 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:35:34.869 --> 04:35:34.879 align:start position:0%
a proclamation
 
04:35:37.429 --> 04:35:37.439 align:start position:0%
or house resolution getting sent to them
 
04:35:39.109 --> 04:35:39.119 align:start position:0%
would only
 
04:35:41.910 --> 04:35:41.920 align:start position:0%
um be sent once and if this was in
 
04:35:45.109 --> 04:35:45.119 align:start position:0%
statute as as is suggested in law it
 
04:35:46.150 --> 04:35:46.160 align:start position:0%
would be
 
04:35:48.949 --> 04:35:48.959 align:start position:0%
it would be reiterated every s
 
04:35:51.910 --> 04:35:51.920 align:start position:0%
with every new um person getting elected
 
04:35:53.269 --> 04:35:53.279 align:start position:0%
they would be
 
04:35:54.949 --> 04:35:54.959 align:start position:0%
um as long as we're
 
04:35:57.429 --> 04:35:57.439 align:start position:0%
we're having this delatorious
 
04:36:00.230 --> 04:36:00.240 align:start position:0%
effect on our on our citizens and on our
 
04:36:02.629 --> 04:36:02.639 align:start position:0%
nation that each one of those new
 
04:36:04.390 --> 04:36:04.400 align:start position:0%
representatives as they get elected
 
04:36:06.230 --> 04:36:06.240 align:start position:0%
should be aware that this is an issue
 
04:36:08.230 --> 04:36:08.240 align:start position:0%
that new hampshire wants
 
04:36:11.109 --> 04:36:11.119 align:start position:0%
addressed by them i think
 
04:36:14.150 --> 04:36:14.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:15.990 --> 04:36:16.000 align:start position:0%
representative phillip
 
04:36:18.869 --> 04:36:18.879 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um my question is
 
04:36:20.869 --> 04:36:20.879 align:start position:0%
closely related to that
 
04:36:24.070 --> 04:36:24.080 align:start position:0%
um i my concern was
 
04:36:26.789 --> 04:36:26.799 align:start position:0%
the governor is supposed you're telling
 
04:36:29.189 --> 04:36:29.199 align:start position:0%
the governor something he needs to do
 
04:36:30.830 --> 04:36:30.840 align:start position:0%
every year
 
04:36:33.990 --> 04:36:34.000 align:start position:0%
and i just what if the governor doesn't
 
04:36:36.789 --> 04:36:36.799 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:38.709 --> 04:36:38.719 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
04:36:38.719 --> 04:36:40.551 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
we

04:36:40.551 --> 04:36:40.561 align:start position:0%
we
 
04:36:40.561 --> 04:36:41.750 align:start position:0%
we
we

04:36:41.750 --> 04:36:41.760 align:start position:0%
we
 
04:36:44.310 --> 04:36:44.320 align:start position:0%
have multiple
 
04:36:45.750 --> 04:36:45.760 align:start position:0%
requirements for
 
04:36:47.830 --> 04:36:47.840 align:start position:0%
declarations of different days and
 
04:36:50.390 --> 04:36:50.400 align:start position:0%
different like the government governor
 
04:36:52.869 --> 04:36:52.879 align:start position:0%
just did a declaration of black history
 
04:36:55.349 --> 04:36:55.359 align:start position:0%
month right all of those things
 
04:36:57.189 --> 04:36:57.199 align:start position:0%
can be um
 
04:36:58.869 --> 04:36:58.879 align:start position:0%
in statute also
 
04:37:01.670 --> 04:37:01.680 align:start position:0%
whether or not he um that one specific
 
04:37:04.070 --> 04:37:04.080 align:start position:0%
one is in statute they are
 
04:37:05.670 --> 04:37:05.680 align:start position:0%
are um
 
04:37:09.029 --> 04:37:09.039 align:start position:0%
it's just another way of having the
 
04:37:13.189 --> 04:37:13.199 align:start position:0%
issue brought to the attention of people
 
04:37:16.310 --> 04:37:16.320 align:start position:0%
under especially in march when the
 
04:37:20.551 --> 04:37:20.561 align:start position:0%
daylight savings time is affecting them
 
04:37:23.109 --> 04:37:23.119 align:start position:0%
it should be you know friend of mine
 
04:37:25.269 --> 04:37:25.279 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:37:27.269 --> 04:37:27.279 align:start position:0%
thank you are there other questions
 
04:37:29.510 --> 04:37:29.520 align:start position:0%
representative pierce
 
04:37:33.029 --> 04:37:33.039 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:34.949 --> 04:37:34.959 align:start position:0%
one of the things that uh when we see
 
04:37:34.959 --> 04:37:35.990 align:start position:0%
one of the things that uh when we see
these

04:37:35.990 --> 04:37:36.000 align:start position:0%
these
 
04:37:38.789 --> 04:37:38.799 align:start position:0%
the various types of legislation that's
 
04:37:40.551 --> 04:37:40.561 align:start position:0%
brought forward
 
04:37:43.429 --> 04:37:43.439 align:start position:0%
along these lines um
 
04:37:45.429 --> 04:37:45.439 align:start position:0%
you know
 
04:37:47.429 --> 04:37:47.439 align:start position:0%
they they all have a tendency to state
 
04:37:49.670 --> 04:37:49.680 align:start position:0%
something similar in the sense of
 
04:37:51.670 --> 04:37:51.680 align:start position:0%
observe this month in an appropriate
 
04:37:51.680 --> 04:37:53.830 align:start position:0%
observe this month in an appropriate
manner

04:37:53.830 --> 04:37:53.840 align:start position:0%
manner
 
04:37:55.349 --> 04:37:55.359 align:start position:0%
early on in the state's history they
 
04:37:56.949 --> 04:37:56.959 align:start position:0%
would have the phrase celebratory
 
04:37:58.789 --> 04:37:58.799 align:start position:0%
gunfire i mean there was there was all
 
04:38:01.429 --> 04:38:01.439 align:start position:0%
kinds of stuff that used to come in here
 
04:38:03.670 --> 04:38:03.680 align:start position:0%
what but in all seriousness though you
 
04:38:05.510 --> 04:38:05.520 align:start position:0%
know observ
 
04:38:07.670 --> 04:38:07.680 align:start position:0%
observe the month in an appropriate
 
04:38:09.670 --> 04:38:09.680 align:start position:0%
manner to raise awareness what do you
 
04:38:13.990 --> 04:38:14.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:15.670 --> 04:38:15.680 align:start position:0%
from the governor's perspective i think
 
04:38:17.429 --> 04:38:17.439 align:start position:0%
just a proclamation
 
04:38:19.429 --> 04:38:19.439 align:start position:0%
of the of
 
04:38:21.990 --> 04:38:22.000 align:start position:0%
that that this is
 
04:38:22.000 --> 04:38:23.109 align:start position:0%
that that this is
um

04:38:23.109 --> 04:38:23.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:38:25.269 --> 04:38:25.279 align:start position:0%
that the loss of sleep during the
 
04:38:27.349 --> 04:38:27.359 align:start position:0%
daylight savings time
 
04:38:29.910 --> 04:38:29.920 align:start position:0%
era is something that
 
04:38:31.349 --> 04:38:31.359 align:start position:0%
you know
 
04:38:35.189 --> 04:38:35.199 align:start position:0%
affects public safety as far as
 
04:38:37.269 --> 04:38:37.279 align:start position:0%
increased car crashes increased heart
 
04:38:40.070 --> 04:38:40.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:41.670 --> 04:38:41.680 align:start position:0%
work related in
 
04:38:41.680 --> 04:38:42.869 align:start position:0%
work related in
accidents

04:38:42.869 --> 04:38:42.879 align:start position:0%
accidents
 
04:38:44.629 --> 04:38:44.639 align:start position:0%
all of those things
 
04:38:46.150 --> 04:38:46.160 align:start position:0%
um you know
 
04:38:47.429 --> 04:38:47.439 align:start position:0%
could be
 
04:38:47.439 --> 04:38:48.390 align:start position:0%
could be
done

04:38:48.390 --> 04:38:48.400 align:start position:0%
done
 
04:38:50.551 --> 04:38:50.561 align:start position:0%
or mentioned inside of such a
 
04:38:52.869 --> 04:38:52.879 align:start position:0%
proclamation and then
 
04:38:56.070 --> 04:38:56.080 align:start position:0%
people reading that would be
 
04:38:57.990 --> 04:38:58.000 align:start position:0%
able to research that information
 
04:39:00.390 --> 04:39:00.400 align:start position:0%
further and get more informed
 
04:39:02.470 --> 04:39:02.480 align:start position:0%
can i have a follow-up
 
04:39:03.349 --> 04:39:03.359 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:39:04.551 --> 04:39:04.561 align:start position:0%
madam chair
 
04:39:08.789 --> 04:39:08.799 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:11.750 --> 04:39:11.760 align:start position:0%
sleep issues connected with
 
04:39:13.910 --> 04:39:13.920 align:start position:0%
daylight savings time and not the
 
04:39:13.920 --> 04:39:17.349 align:start position:0%
daylight savings time and not the
overall

04:39:17.349 --> 04:39:17.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:19.029 --> 04:39:19.039 align:start position:0%
concept of
 
04:39:21.990 --> 04:39:22.000 align:start position:0%
appropriate levels of sleep
 
04:39:26.709 --> 04:39:26.719 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:30.789 --> 04:39:30.799 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:30.799 --> 04:39:31.670 align:start position:0%
 
the

04:39:31.670 --> 04:39:31.680 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:39:31.680 --> 04:39:33.670 align:start position:0%
the
the

04:39:33.670 --> 04:39:33.680 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:39:35.590 --> 04:39:35.600 align:start position:0%
reason that
 
04:39:40.868 --> 04:39:40.878 align:start position:0%
march is chosen is because of the
 
04:39:43.670 --> 04:39:43.680 align:start position:0%
specific of the loss of sleep that
 
04:39:45.670 --> 04:39:45.680 align:start position:0%
happens in that month
 
04:39:45.680 --> 04:39:46.830 align:start position:0%
happens in that month
right

04:39:46.830 --> 04:39:46.840 align:start position:0%
right
 
04:39:46.840 --> 04:39:48.470 align:start position:0%
right
um

04:39:48.470 --> 04:39:48.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:39:51.430 --> 04:39:51.440 align:start position:0%
that does not mean that it is not
 
04:39:54.230 --> 04:39:54.240 align:start position:0%
important the rest of the year it's just
 
04:39:57.350 --> 04:39:57.360 align:start position:0%
brought to a point because the
 
04:40:00.550 --> 04:40:00.560 align:start position:0%
as as a
 
04:40:02.868 --> 04:40:02.878 align:start position:0%
a country we are
 
04:40:04.470 --> 04:40:04.480 align:start position:0%
having a
 
04:40:06.948 --> 04:40:06.958 align:start position:0%
negative effect on our citizens at that
 
04:40:08.550 --> 04:40:08.560 align:start position:0%
point and so
 
04:40:11.750 --> 04:40:11.760 align:start position:0%
it it offers us the opportunity while
 
04:40:14.150 --> 04:40:14.160 align:start position:0%
we're not actually fixing the problem
 
04:40:17.430 --> 04:40:17.440 align:start position:0%
that we can suggest hey you might be
 
04:40:20.070 --> 04:40:20.080 align:start position:0%
mindful of you're going to lose sleep if
 
04:40:23.350 --> 04:40:23.360 align:start position:0%
you don't um
 
04:40:25.190 --> 04:40:25.200 align:start position:0%
adjust your habits
 
04:40:27.270 --> 04:40:27.280 align:start position:0%
that over this weekend maybe go to sleep
 
04:40:29.670 --> 04:40:29.680 align:start position:0%
an hour earlier so that
 
04:40:29.680 --> 04:40:30.470 align:start position:0%
an hour earlier so that
the

04:40:30.470 --> 04:40:30.480 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:40:33.270 --> 04:40:33.280 align:start position:0%
you won't have these negative effects
 
04:40:33.280 --> 04:40:34.230 align:start position:0%
you won't have these negative effects
of

04:40:34.230 --> 04:40:34.240 align:start position:0%
of
 
04:40:35.590 --> 04:40:35.600 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
04:40:38.150 --> 04:40:38.160 align:start position:0%
the change what of the time while you're
 
04:40:42.070 --> 04:40:42.080 align:start position:0%
sleeping and therefore um would
 
04:40:45.990 --> 04:40:46.000 align:start position:0%
help to decrease your amount of
 
04:40:49.030 --> 04:40:49.040 align:start position:0%
risk from damage uh from
 
04:40:51.750 --> 04:40:51.760 align:start position:0%
the the time switching and so i think
 
04:40:52.628 --> 04:40:52.638 align:start position:0%
it's a
 
04:40:55.110 --> 04:40:55.120 align:start position:0%
it's a pinpoint in time that that we
 
04:40:57.910 --> 04:40:57.920 align:start position:0%
should bring awareness to it but it's a
 
04:41:01.030 --> 04:41:01.040 align:start position:0%
very very big issue all the days of the
 
04:41:01.040 --> 04:41:03.510 align:start position:0%
very very big issue all the days of the
year

04:41:03.510 --> 04:41:03.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:04.788 --> 04:41:04.798 align:start position:0%
thank you representative chute you have
 
04:41:06.310 --> 04:41:06.320 align:start position:0%
a follow-up
 
04:41:09.990 --> 04:41:10.000 align:start position:0%
sort of a new topic
 
04:41:11.990 --> 04:41:12.000 align:start position:0%
i've been around this whole planet quite
 
04:41:13.030 --> 04:41:13.040 align:start position:0%
a while
 
04:41:14.628 --> 04:41:14.638 align:start position:0%
and i can remember
 
04:41:18.470 --> 04:41:18.480 align:start position:0%
the actual date of changing the times
 
04:41:20.230 --> 04:41:20.240 align:start position:0%
has changed
 
04:41:22.708 --> 04:41:22.718 align:start position:0%
changed dates changed months
 
04:41:24.948 --> 04:41:24.958 align:start position:0%
what happens if we decide that we're not
 
04:41:27.430 --> 04:41:27.440 align:start position:0%
going to do this until april and we have
 
04:41:33.590 --> 04:41:33.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:36.550 --> 04:41:36.560 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
04:41:38.550 --> 04:41:38.560 align:start position:0%
if we were to amend the
 
04:41:41.670 --> 04:41:41.680 align:start position:0%
the statute that says the second week in
 
04:41:43.830 --> 04:41:43.840 align:start position:0%
march then we would also be able to
 
04:41:47.190 --> 04:41:47.200 align:start position:0%
amend this bill but or this this statute
 
04:41:50.150 --> 04:41:50.160 align:start position:0%
technically but um
 
04:41:53.590 --> 04:41:53.600 align:start position:0%
generally those changes actually
 
04:41:55.190 --> 04:41:55.200 align:start position:0%
are to
 
04:41:58.708 --> 04:41:58.718 align:start position:0%
the other time frame of trying to get it
 
04:41:58.718 --> 04:41:59.750 align:start position:0%
the other time frame of trying to get it
earlier

04:41:59.750 --> 04:41:59.760 align:start position:0%
earlier
 
04:41:59.760 --> 04:42:00.788 align:start position:0%
earlier
um

04:42:00.788 --> 04:42:00.798 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:42:02.550 --> 04:42:02.560 align:start position:0%
they're trying to expand
 
04:42:04.230 --> 04:42:04.240 align:start position:0%
it into
 
04:42:05.830 --> 04:42:05.840 align:start position:0%
more into summer
 
04:42:08.550 --> 04:42:08.560 align:start position:0%
is is my understanding of those changes
 
04:42:09.590 --> 04:42:09.600 align:start position:0%
and so
 
04:42:12.230 --> 04:42:12.240 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure that that
 
04:42:12.240 --> 04:42:13.350 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure that that
that

04:42:13.350 --> 04:42:13.360 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:42:15.430 --> 04:42:15.440 align:start position:0%
would come up and hopefully it wouldn't
 
04:42:17.990 --> 04:42:18.000 align:start position:0%
come up they would just fix the time and
 
04:42:23.350 --> 04:42:23.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:25.030 --> 04:42:25.040 align:start position:0%
thank you that we all hope that this
 
04:42:27.350 --> 04:42:27.360 align:start position:0%
will this issue will be uh conquered at
 
04:42:28.550 --> 04:42:28.560 align:start position:0%
some point
 
04:42:31.590 --> 04:42:31.600 align:start position:0%
any uh other questions
 
04:42:34.550 --> 04:42:34.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:36.070 --> 04:42:36.080 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you
 
04:42:38.230 --> 04:42:38.240 align:start position:0%
representative for taking the question i
 
04:42:39.510 --> 04:42:39.520 align:start position:0%
know the speaker's in the way for me
 
04:42:40.948 --> 04:42:40.958 align:start position:0%
seeing you
 
04:42:40.958 --> 04:42:43.350 align:start position:0%
seeing you
um

04:42:43.350 --> 04:42:43.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:44.628 --> 04:42:44.638 align:start position:0%
i know this
 
04:42:46.390 --> 04:42:46.400 align:start position:0%
evolves around daylight savings time and
 
04:42:48.230 --> 04:42:48.240 align:start position:0%
the issue with that
 
04:42:50.470 --> 04:42:50.480 align:start position:0%
but is it not true that tens of
 
04:42:52.150 --> 04:42:52.160 align:start position:0%
thousands of
 
04:42:54.628 --> 04:42:54.638 align:start position:0%
citizens travel on a daily basis outside
 
04:42:56.550 --> 04:42:56.560 align:start position:0%
of their time zone whether it be one
 
04:42:58.550 --> 04:42:58.560 align:start position:0%
time zone or two or three time zones
 
04:43:02.150 --> 04:43:02.160 align:start position:0%
away being deprived of sleep and their
 
04:43:06.788 --> 04:43:06.798 align:start position:0%
clock being put off on a regular basis
 
04:43:08.390 --> 04:43:08.400 align:start position:0%
thank you for that question
 
04:43:10.150 --> 04:43:10.160 align:start position:0%
and yes the
 
04:43:12.788 --> 04:43:12.798 align:start position:0%
the negative impacts are
 
04:43:15.670 --> 04:43:15.680 align:start position:0%
often referred to as jet lag
 
04:43:16.788 --> 04:43:16.798 align:start position:0%
and that
 
04:43:16.798 --> 04:43:17.670 align:start position:0%
and that
um

04:43:17.670 --> 04:43:17.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:43:17.680 --> 04:43:18.470 align:start position:0%
um
is

04:43:18.470 --> 04:43:18.480 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:43:20.470 --> 04:43:20.480 align:start position:0%
the grogginess that someone feels when
 
04:43:20.480 --> 04:43:21.510 align:start position:0%
the grogginess that someone feels when
they

04:43:21.510 --> 04:43:21.520 align:start position:0%
they
 
04:43:24.150 --> 04:43:24.160 align:start position:0%
are trying to reset their clock
 
04:43:26.708 --> 04:43:26.718 align:start position:0%
their internal clock based on this new
 
04:43:28.310 --> 04:43:28.320 align:start position:0%
um you know
 
04:43:30.310 --> 04:43:30.320 align:start position:0%
new position on the earth in relation to
 
04:43:33.670 --> 04:43:33.680 align:start position:0%
the sun
 
04:43:34.948 --> 04:43:34.958 align:start position:0%
that is
 
04:43:38.948 --> 04:43:38.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:38.958 --> 04:43:39.830 align:start position:0%
 
but

04:43:39.830 --> 04:43:39.840 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:43:42.948 --> 04:43:42.958 align:start position:0%
if you're not getting enough sleep there
 
04:43:47.190 --> 04:43:47.200 align:start position:0%
in addition to the jet lag you may have
 
04:43:50.628 --> 04:43:50.638 align:start position:0%
other health consequences also so
 
04:43:50.638 --> 04:43:52.230 align:start position:0%
other health consequences also so
um

04:43:52.230 --> 04:43:52.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:43:54.948 --> 04:43:54.958 align:start position:0%
there's an opportunity to train to
 
04:43:57.110 --> 04:43:57.120 align:start position:0%
encourage people that are traveling into
 
04:44:00.470 --> 04:44:00.480 align:start position:0%
different time zones to
 
04:44:01.990 --> 04:44:02.000 align:start position:0%
to sleep more
 
04:44:03.590 --> 04:44:03.600 align:start position:0%
so that they
 
04:44:05.750 --> 04:44:05.760 align:start position:0%
can lessen those
 
04:44:08.390 --> 04:44:08.400 align:start position:0%
negative effects absolutely thank you
 
04:44:12.830 --> 04:44:12.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:16.628 --> 04:44:16.638 align:start position:0%
follow-up so wouldn't you agree that
 
04:44:18.788 --> 04:44:18.798 align:start position:0%
those traveling
 
04:44:21.350 --> 04:44:21.360 align:start position:0%
routinely are more at risk than a
 
04:44:25.670 --> 04:44:25.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:27.590 --> 04:44:27.600 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question as i stated
 
04:44:27.600 --> 04:44:28.948 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question as i stated
before

04:44:28.948 --> 04:44:28.958 align:start position:0%
before
 
04:44:31.990 --> 04:44:32.000 align:start position:0%
sleep is an issue all of the days
 
04:44:35.830 --> 04:44:35.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:39.430 --> 04:44:39.440 align:start position:0%
if people don't have
 
04:44:41.590 --> 04:44:41.600 align:start position:0%
proper sleep schedule
 
04:44:43.990 --> 04:44:44.000 align:start position:0%
whether that whether they travel or not
 
04:44:46.788 --> 04:44:46.798 align:start position:0%
it will negatively impact them
 
04:44:51.190 --> 04:44:51.200 align:start position:0%
and shorten their lifespan and and
 
04:44:53.270 --> 04:44:53.280 align:start position:0%
also make them much more prone to
 
04:44:55.270 --> 04:44:55.280 align:start position:0%
disease and have a weaker immune system
 
04:44:58.470 --> 04:44:58.480 align:start position:0%
and all all the different things and so
 
04:45:00.788 --> 04:45:00.798 align:start position:0%
yes i think that
 
04:45:03.350 --> 04:45:03.360 align:start position:0%
people that travel a lot and have a hard
 
04:45:04.948 --> 04:45:04.958 align:start position:0%
time getting in a
 
04:45:06.550 --> 04:45:06.560 align:start position:0%
a rhythm of
 
04:45:07.910 --> 04:45:07.920 align:start position:0%
proper sleep
 
04:45:07.920 --> 04:45:09.190 align:start position:0%
proper sleep
will

04:45:09.190 --> 04:45:09.200 align:start position:0%
will
 
04:45:10.550 --> 04:45:10.560 align:start position:0%
be suffering
 
04:45:13.190 --> 04:45:13.200 align:start position:0%
these the the negative effects of lack
 
04:45:16.550 --> 04:45:16.560 align:start position:0%
of sleep and and in fact
 
04:45:19.030 --> 04:45:19.040 align:start position:0%
um i think uh
 
04:45:21.350 --> 04:45:21.360 align:start position:0%
there's only
 
04:45:21.360 --> 04:45:22.310 align:start position:0%
there's only
in

04:45:22.310 --> 04:45:22.320 align:start position:0%
in
 
04:45:25.030 --> 04:45:25.040 align:start position:0%
in the research there's
 
04:45:28.550 --> 04:45:28.560 align:start position:0%
suggested as little as three percent of
 
04:45:30.948 --> 04:45:30.958 align:start position:0%
of um teenagers are getting the
 
04:45:33.750 --> 04:45:33.760 align:start position:0%
recommended number of hours of sleep and
 
04:45:34.948 --> 04:45:34.958 align:start position:0%
it's not
 
04:45:34.958 --> 04:45:36.070 align:start position:0%
it's not
um

04:45:36.070 --> 04:45:36.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:45:39.670 --> 04:45:39.680 align:start position:0%
that much better for for adults so um we
 
04:45:42.470 --> 04:45:42.480 align:start position:0%
all are harming ourselves and it's
 
04:45:45.830 --> 04:45:45.840 align:start position:0%
having um a significant impact on our
 
04:45:49.510 --> 04:45:49.520 align:start position:0%
longevity our health our safety and so
 
04:45:52.390 --> 04:45:52.400 align:start position:0%
bringing awareness to this it will help
 
04:45:52.400 --> 04:45:55.270 align:start position:0%
bringing awareness to this it will help
us

04:45:55.270 --> 04:45:55.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:57.670 --> 04:45:57.680 align:start position:0%
have the opportunity to
 
04:46:00.230 --> 04:46:00.240 align:start position:0%
change our habits and maybe even if
 
04:46:02.070 --> 04:46:02.080 align:start position:0%
you're traveling then you would be able
 
04:46:02.080 --> 04:46:03.350 align:start position:0%
you're traveling then you would be able
to

04:46:03.350 --> 04:46:03.360 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:46:03.360 --> 04:46:05.030 align:start position:0%
to
maybe

04:46:05.030 --> 04:46:05.040 align:start position:0%
maybe
 
04:46:08.390 --> 04:46:08.400 align:start position:0%
be more mindful of when you should sleep
 
04:46:10.708 --> 04:46:10.718 align:start position:0%
so that you can get the proper amount of
 
04:46:12.948 --> 04:46:12.958 align:start position:0%
hours of sleep so that your body can
 
04:46:14.470 --> 04:46:14.480 align:start position:0%
help repair itself
 
04:46:17.350 --> 04:46:17.360 align:start position:0%
as it is doing when you sleep thank you
 
04:46:19.510 --> 04:46:19.520 align:start position:0%
thank you i believe this is drifting a
 
04:46:21.510 --> 04:46:21.520 align:start position:0%
bit representative
 
04:46:22.948 --> 04:46:22.958 align:start position:0%
fellows you have a question about the
 
04:46:22.958 --> 04:46:24.310 align:start position:0%
fellows you have a question about the
bill

04:46:24.310 --> 04:46:24.320 align:start position:0%
bill
 
04:46:25.910 --> 04:46:25.920 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:46:28.948 --> 04:46:28.958 align:start position:0%
so so my question is you know
 
04:46:30.868 --> 04:46:30.878 align:start position:0%
well while you probably remember that i
 
04:46:32.708 --> 04:46:32.718 align:start position:0%
don't agree with the daylight savings
 
04:46:34.470 --> 04:46:34.480 align:start position:0%
time thing i certainly do agree that
 
04:46:37.350 --> 04:46:37.360 align:start position:0%
people should get a lot of sleep or the
 
04:46:39.270 --> 04:46:39.280 align:start position:0%
right amount and it's a medical issue
 
04:46:41.990 --> 04:46:42.000 align:start position:0%
because not having enough sleep
 
04:46:44.230 --> 04:46:44.240 align:start position:0%
in all the situations you've mentioned
 
04:46:47.430 --> 04:46:47.440 align:start position:0%
plus others can cause problems
 
04:46:50.788 --> 04:46:50.798 align:start position:0%
but in terms of having a proclamation
 
04:46:53.510 --> 04:46:53.520 align:start position:0%
are we going to have proclamations for
 
04:46:55.830 --> 04:46:55.840 align:start position:0%
every kind of
 
04:46:59.270 --> 04:46:59.280 align:start position:0%
behavior that carries a um you know a
 
04:46:59.280 --> 04:47:01.590 align:start position:0%
behavior that carries a um you know a
medical

04:47:01.590 --> 04:47:01.600 align:start position:0%
medical
 
04:47:01.600 --> 04:47:02.628 align:start position:0%
medical
benefit

04:47:02.628 --> 04:47:02.638 align:start position:0%
benefit
 
04:47:05.030 --> 04:47:05.040 align:start position:0%
to it i mean eat your vegetables and i
 
04:47:07.110 --> 04:47:07.120 align:start position:0%
mean we could go on and on so i'm
 
04:47:09.190 --> 04:47:09.200 align:start position:0%
wondering if how appropriate you feel
 
04:47:11.910 --> 04:47:11.920 align:start position:0%
this is as a proclamation related to
 
04:47:11.920 --> 04:47:12.948 align:start position:0%
this is as a proclamation related to
health

04:47:12.948 --> 04:47:12.958 align:start position:0%
health
 
04:47:16.470 --> 04:47:16.480 align:start position:0%
thank you for the the question um i
 
04:47:20.550 --> 04:47:20.560 align:start position:0%
do remember that you um opposed the
 
04:47:23.190 --> 04:47:23.200 align:start position:0%
proposed changes from me about daylight
 
04:47:24.868 --> 04:47:24.878 align:start position:0%
savings time and suggested that it
 
04:47:26.868 --> 04:47:26.878 align:start position:0%
should be a federal issue so i would
 
04:47:29.270 --> 04:47:29.280 align:start position:0%
hope that you would be supportive of
 
04:47:31.350 --> 04:47:31.360 align:start position:0%
asking the federal people to address it
 
04:47:33.270 --> 04:47:33.280 align:start position:0%
so that i would stop coming back to your
 
04:47:34.948 --> 04:47:34.958 align:start position:0%
committee however
 
04:47:34.958 --> 04:47:35.990 align:start position:0%
committee however
um

04:47:35.990 --> 04:47:36.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:47:37.270 --> 04:47:37.280 align:start position:0%
i would all appreciate that
 
04:47:37.280 --> 04:47:38.628 align:start position:0%
i would all appreciate that
representative

04:47:38.628 --> 04:47:38.638 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:47:40.550 --> 04:47:40.560 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:47:43.190 --> 04:47:43.200 align:start position:0%
however um as i was as i was stating
 
04:47:47.190 --> 04:47:47.200 align:start position:0%
before this the um
 
04:47:49.670 --> 04:47:49.680 align:start position:0%
that the sleep is so fundamental and
 
04:47:51.990 --> 04:47:52.000 align:start position:0%
it's so it has such an impact it's even
 
04:47:54.390 --> 04:47:54.400 align:start position:0%
more important than diet and exercise
 
04:47:57.030 --> 04:47:57.040 align:start position:0%
because they don't they don't have the
 
04:47:58.948 --> 04:47:58.958 align:start position:0%
effects that you they that you're
 
04:48:01.030 --> 04:48:01.040 align:start position:0%
seeking if you don't have enough
 
04:48:02.788 --> 04:48:02.798 align:start position:0%
sleep to
 
04:48:04.868 --> 04:48:04.878 align:start position:0%
um for your body to
 
04:48:07.830 --> 04:48:07.840 align:start position:0%
um properly deal with the
 
04:48:10.390 --> 04:48:10.400 align:start position:0%
exercise and diet that you're trying to
 
04:48:10.400 --> 04:48:11.190 align:start position:0%
exercise and diet that you're trying to
to

04:48:11.190 --> 04:48:11.200 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:48:13.750 --> 04:48:13.760 align:start position:0%
maintain um
 
04:48:13.760 --> 04:48:15.670 align:start position:0%
maintain um
so

04:48:15.670 --> 04:48:15.680 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:48:17.350 --> 04:48:17.360 align:start position:0%
as far as
 
04:48:17.360 --> 04:48:18.230 align:start position:0%
as far as
um

04:48:18.230 --> 04:48:18.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:48:19.990 --> 04:48:20.000 align:start position:0%
you know what the government should and
 
04:48:22.390 --> 04:48:22.400 align:start position:0%
should not be doing as far as as
 
04:48:24.868 --> 04:48:24.878 align:start position:0%
recommending stuff you know they're
 
04:48:24.878 --> 04:48:25.910 align:start position:0%
recommending stuff you know they're
the the

04:48:25.910 --> 04:48:25.920 align:start position:0%
the the
 
04:48:29.030 --> 04:48:29.040 align:start position:0%
government recommended the the chart the
 
04:48:31.830 --> 04:48:31.840 align:start position:0%
food chart the pyramid which is now
 
04:48:34.628 --> 04:48:34.638 align:start position:0%
found to be completely bogus and
 
04:48:38.830 --> 04:48:38.840 align:start position:0%
and causing a lot of disease and and
 
04:48:41.430 --> 04:48:41.440 align:start position:0%
uh diabetes because we're eating too
 
04:48:42.550 --> 04:48:42.560 align:start position:0%
many carbs
 
04:48:45.350 --> 04:48:45.360 align:start position:0%
stuff like that so i i would be
 
04:48:47.270 --> 04:48:47.280 align:start position:0%
concerned about the government
 
04:48:50.230 --> 04:48:50.240 align:start position:0%
suggesting a bunch of things but it
 
04:48:52.868 --> 04:48:52.878 align:start position:0%
i don't think that this is suggesting it
 
04:48:54.628 --> 04:48:54.638 align:start position:0%
it's just saying you should be educated
 
04:48:57.830 --> 04:48:57.840 align:start position:0%
on this because it's
 
04:48:59.830 --> 04:48:59.840 align:start position:0%
negative affecting your health and so
 
04:49:01.510 --> 04:49:01.520 align:start position:0%
it's not prescribing that this is the
 
04:49:03.190 --> 04:49:03.200 align:start position:0%
solution like the
 
04:49:05.270 --> 04:49:05.280 align:start position:0%
food pyramid chart it's saying hey this
 
04:49:07.510 --> 04:49:07.520 align:start position:0%
is an issue you need to look at look at
 
04:49:09.190 --> 04:49:09.200 align:start position:0%
this and and learn
 
04:49:11.830 --> 04:49:11.840 align:start position:0%
educate yourself thank you thank you are
 
04:49:13.030 --> 04:49:13.040 align:start position:0%
there any
 
04:49:16.550 --> 04:49:16.560 align:start position:0%
other questions relevant to the bill
 
04:49:18.070 --> 04:49:18.080 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
04:49:19.510 --> 04:49:19.520 align:start position:0%
seeing none
 
04:49:21.030 --> 04:49:21.040 align:start position:0%
is there anyone else who wishes to
 
04:49:25.510 --> 04:49:25.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:27.110 --> 04:49:27.120 align:start position:0%
seeing none i'm going to close the
 
04:49:32.070 --> 04:49:32.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:34.230 --> 04:49:34.240 align:start position:0%
and does someone wish to make a motion
 
04:49:37.750 --> 04:49:37.760 align:start position:0%
on house bill 1545
 
04:49:41.190 --> 04:49:41.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:43.190 --> 04:49:43.200 align:start position:0%
yes we're going into executive session
 
04:49:44.948 --> 04:49:44.958 align:start position:0%
for just for this one thank you madam

currently
 
04:50:37.110 --> 04:50:37.120 align:start position:0%

as of right now they're happy with
 
04:50:43.750 --> 04:50:43.760 align:start position:0%
what's going on and
 
04:50:45.350 --> 04:50:45.360 align:start position:0%
asked at this bill the sponsor asked
 
04:50:48.150 --> 04:50:48.160 align:start position:0%
that this be and expedient the legislate
 
04:50:49.910 --> 04:50:49.920 align:start position:0%
thank you representative marsh yeah i
 
04:50:51.430 --> 04:50:51.440 align:start position:0%
would just say that the specific piece
 
04:50:53.190 --> 04:50:53.200 align:start position:0%
of information is the division of travel
 
04:50:55.590 --> 04:50:55.600 align:start position:0%
and tourism created a new hampshire film
 
04:50:57.110 --> 04:50:57.120 align:start position:0%
database which is exactly what the
 
04:50:59.110 --> 04:50:59.120 align:start position:0%
sponsors asked for that makes the bill
 
04:50:59.120 --> 04:51:00.470 align:start position:0%
sponsors asked for that makes the bill
unnecessary

04:51:00.470 --> 04:51:00.480 align:start position:0%

one other bill
 
04:53:11.628 --> 04:53:11.638 align:start position:0%

and i would move on to pass okay i think
 
04:53:28.310 --> 04:53:28.320 align:start position:0%
i think the time is just a little short
 
04:53:30.070 --> 04:53:30.080 align:start position:0%
for that
 
04:53:32.550 --> 04:53:32.560 align:start position:0%
we've also got two people missing and i
 
04:53:34.310 --> 04:53:34.320 align:start position:0%
told at least representative allegro
 
04:53:36.150 --> 04:53:36.160 align:start position:0%
that we wouldn't execute anything while
 
04:53:37.430 --> 04:53:37.440 align:start position:0%
he wasn't here
 
04:53:42.390 --> 04:53:42.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:43.750 --> 04:53:43.760 align:start position:0%
while we're on just what quickly while
 
04:53:46.868 --> 04:53:46.878 align:start position:0%
we're on the topic of 1446 is there an
 
04:53:49.350 --> 04:53:49.360 align:start position:0%
amendment that's involved with this bill
 
04:53:51.510 --> 04:53:51.520 align:start position:0%
or is this a straight up not to my
 
04:53:51.520 --> 04:53:53.270 align:start position:0%
or is this a straight up not to my
knowledge

04:53:53.270 --> 04:53:53.280 align:start position:0%
knowledge
 
04:53:55.270 --> 04:53:55.280 align:start position:0%
we only heard
 
04:53:57.590 --> 04:53:57.600 align:start position:0%
a few people testify no one was against
 
04:53:57.600 --> 04:53:58.708 align:start position:0%
a few people testify no one was against
it

04:53:58.708 --> 04:53:58.718 align:start position:0%
it
 
04:54:00.708 --> 04:54:00.718 align:start position:0%
there's been no signatures online
 
04:54:03.350 --> 04:54:03.360 align:start position:0%
opposed to it i just have a note in
 
04:54:05.110 --> 04:54:05.120 align:start position:0%
reference to transitionary language
 
04:54:09.350 --> 04:54:09.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:11.190 --> 04:54:11.200 align:start position:0%
well why don't you look at your notes
 
04:54:13.350 --> 04:54:13.360 align:start position:0%
and see if an amendment is needed well
 
04:54:15.270 --> 04:54:15.280 align:start position:0%
because i don't really want to bring
 
04:54:20.470 --> 04:54:20.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:22.788 --> 04:54:22.798 align:start position:0%
perhaps after uh one of the other bills
 
04:54:25.430 --> 04:54:25.440 align:start position:0%
this afternoon they're pretty close
 
04:54:27.350 --> 04:54:27.360 align:start position:0%
what um
 
04:54:30.470 --> 04:54:30.480 align:start position:0%
mr representative pearson
 
04:54:32.390 --> 04:54:32.400 align:start position:0%
do we have a motion perhaps on house
 
04:54:35.270 --> 04:54:35.280 align:start position:0%
bill 1444. you know
 
04:54:38.390 --> 04:54:38.400 align:start position:0%
you're absolutely right i do oh yeah
 
04:54:40.470 --> 04:54:40.480 align:start position:0%
so uh the subcommittee this we can
 
04:54:42.150 --> 04:54:42.160 align:start position:0%
handle this in the time frame the
 
04:54:44.230 --> 04:54:44.240 align:start position:0%
subcommittee met this morning on house
 
04:54:47.030 --> 04:54:47.040 align:start position:0%
bill 1444 which is an early bill
 
04:54:47.040 --> 04:54:47.830 align:start position:0%
bill 1444 which is an early bill
um

04:54:47.830 --> 04:54:47.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:54:51.590 --> 04:54:51.600 align:start position:0%
we discussed a number of topics that
 
04:54:54.230 --> 04:54:54.240 align:start position:0%
that range from uh licensing versus just
 
04:54:56.230 --> 04:54:56.240 align:start position:0%
simply registration
 
04:54:58.310 --> 04:54:58.320 align:start position:0%
we found that there were some some
 
04:55:00.310 --> 04:55:00.320 align:start position:0%
language within the bill that
 
04:55:02.948 --> 04:55:02.958 align:start position:0%
needed a better definition
 
04:55:05.110 --> 04:55:05.120 align:start position:0%
as far as
 
04:55:09.110 --> 04:55:09.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:11.590 --> 04:55:11.600 align:start position:0%
and we also found
 
04:55:13.110 --> 04:55:13.120 align:start position:0%
looking through here that
 
04:55:16.550 --> 04:55:16.560 align:start position:0%
they this is another bill that wants to
 
04:55:18.070 --> 04:55:18.080 align:start position:0%
define what
 
04:55:20.070 --> 04:55:20.080 align:start position:0%
a inspector is going to be paid and not
 
04:55:22.708 --> 04:55:22.718 align:start position:0%
go through jccc so
 
04:55:24.628 --> 04:55:24.638 align:start position:0%
it was it was discussed within the
 
04:55:26.230 --> 04:55:26.240 align:start position:0%
committee that this would would probably
 
04:55:27.910 --> 04:55:27.920 align:start position:0%
need to go to interim study and that's
 
04:55:30.390 --> 04:55:30.400 align:start position:0%
the motion i'm making
 
04:55:30.400 --> 04:55:31.910 align:start position:0%
the motion i'm making
okay

04:55:31.910 --> 04:55:31.920 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:55:34.070 --> 04:55:34.080 align:start position:0%
so your motion is interim study on house
 
04:55:37.670 --> 04:55:37.680 align:start position:0%
bill 1444. is there a second
 
04:55:40.470 --> 04:55:40.480 align:start position:0%

all right
 
04:55:49.030 --> 04:55:49.040 align:start position:0%

discussion

04:56:04.150 --> 04:56:04.160 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
04:56:06.310 --> 04:56:06.320 align:start position:0%
representative marsh yes one other issue
 
04:56:08.070 --> 04:56:08.080 align:start position:0%
that you didn't mention was the issue of
 
04:56:10.390 --> 04:56:10.400 align:start position:0%
inspections these are basically health
 
04:56:11.830 --> 04:56:11.840 align:start position:0%
care facilities
 
04:56:14.390 --> 04:56:14.400 align:start position:0%
and oplc would have to recreate the
 
04:56:16.628 --> 04:56:16.638 align:start position:0%
ability of hhs to inspect health care
 
04:56:16.638 --> 04:56:18.230 align:start position:0%
ability of hhs to inspect health care
facilities

04:56:18.230 --> 04:56:18.240 align:start position:0%
facilities
 
04:56:20.868 --> 04:56:20.878 align:start position:0%
i did speak to hhs and
 
04:56:22.628 --> 04:56:22.638 align:start position:0%
floated the idea of would they be
 
04:56:24.788 --> 04:56:24.798 align:start position:0%
willing to contract with oplc to perform
 
04:56:26.868 --> 04:56:26.878 align:start position:0%
those inspections for them and they
 
04:56:28.708 --> 04:56:28.718 align:start position:0%
really don't want to do that so that's
 
04:56:30.070 --> 04:56:30.080 align:start position:0%
another can of worms that needs to be
 
04:56:31.670 --> 04:56:31.680 align:start position:0%
addressed and would take considerable
 
04:56:33.590 --> 04:56:33.600 align:start position:0%
time yes ma'am sure we um there were
 
04:56:35.750 --> 04:56:35.760 align:start position:0%
representatives from oplc and hhs
 
04:56:37.510 --> 04:56:37.520 align:start position:0%
present in the subcommittee and we
 
04:56:40.150 --> 04:56:40.160 align:start position:0%
absolutely address the jurisdictional
 
04:56:42.550 --> 04:56:42.560 align:start position:0%
boundary problem
 
04:56:44.150 --> 04:56:44.160 align:start position:0%
between the two of them is something
 
04:56:45.590 --> 04:56:45.600 align:start position:0%
that needed further
 
04:56:47.190 --> 04:56:47.200 align:start position:0%
further investigation
 
04:56:49.110 --> 04:56:49.120 align:start position:0%
i see i i think you just didn't mention
 
04:56:51.190 --> 04:56:51.200 align:start position:0%
that in your comments it's going to be a
 
04:56:53.590 --> 04:56:53.600 align:start position:0%
very busy subcommittee i've got to say

hb 1443 would proclaim the first monday
 
05:02:05.830 --> 05:02:05.840 align:start position:0%
in march as covet 19 victims and
 
05:02:08.390 --> 05:02:08.400 align:start position:0%
survivors memorial day
 
05:02:10.390 --> 05:02:10.400 align:start position:0%
since the start of the pandemic in 2020
 
05:02:12.310 --> 05:02:12.320 align:start position:0%
there have been over nine hundred
 
05:02:14.708 --> 05:02:14.718 align:start position:0%
thousand deaths in the united states
 
05:02:14.718 --> 05:02:15.510 align:start position:0%
thousand deaths in the united states
and

05:02:15.510 --> 05:02:15.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:02:17.750 --> 05:02:17.760 align:start position:0%
twenty two hundred and sixty deaths in
 
05:02:18.948 --> 05:02:18.958 align:start position:0%
the state of new hampshire that have
 
05:02:21.750 --> 05:02:21.760 align:start position:0%
been attributed to the coronavirus
 
05:02:23.590 --> 05:02:23.600 align:start position:0%
nationally it's been estimated that over
 
05:02:26.070 --> 05:02:26.080 align:start position:0%
two hundred thousand children have lost
 
05:02:28.550 --> 05:02:28.560 align:start position:0%
at least one parent
 
05:02:30.470 --> 05:02:30.480 align:start position:0%
here in new hampshire our death toll
 
05:02:33.030 --> 05:02:33.040 align:start position:0%
seems small by comparison
 
05:02:35.510 --> 05:02:35.520 align:start position:0%
to the staggering national numbers but
 
05:02:38.708 --> 05:02:38.718 align:start position:0%
by springtime our small states covet 19
 
05:02:41.270 --> 05:02:41.280 align:start position:0%
death toll will likely equal or surpass
 
05:02:43.350 --> 05:02:43.360 align:start position:0%
the number of deaths that occurred
 
05:02:47.190 --> 05:02:47.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:49.110 --> 05:02:49.120 align:start position:0%
in our state and across the country the
 
05:02:51.270 --> 05:02:51.280 align:start position:0%
elderly and the medically vulnerable
 
05:02:53.430 --> 05:02:53.440 align:start position:0%
have suffered greatly
 
05:02:55.750 --> 05:02:55.760 align:start position:0%
although people age 70 and over have
 
05:02:58.070 --> 05:02:58.080 align:start position:0%
suffered just seven percent of new
 
05:02:59.750 --> 05:02:59.760 align:start position:0%
hampshire's total the covet 19
 
05:02:59.760 --> 05:03:01.110 align:start position:0%
hampshire's total the covet 19
infections

05:03:01.110 --> 05:03:01.120 align:start position:0%
infections
 
05:03:03.990 --> 05:03:04.000 align:start position:0%
this age group has comprised 45 percent
 
05:03:05.830 --> 05:03:05.840 align:start position:0%
of hospitalizations
 
05:03:09.350 --> 05:03:09.360 align:start position:0%
and 77 percent of new hampshire's total
 
05:03:11.830 --> 05:03:11.840 align:start position:0%
coronavirus deaths
 
05:03:13.510 --> 05:03:13.520 align:start position:0%
while younger people have generally been
 
05:03:15.990 --> 05:03:16.000 align:start position:0%
spared from the most serious symptoms it
 
05:03:17.670 --> 05:03:17.680 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be forgotten that our state's
 
05:03:19.030 --> 05:03:19.040 align:start position:0%
youngest victim
 
05:03:21.670 --> 05:03:21.680 align:start position:0%
was only nine years old
 
05:03:24.150 --> 05:03:24.160 align:start position:0%
we also shouldn't forget the sacrifice
 
05:03:26.070 --> 05:03:26.080 align:start position:0%
of the 19 new hampshire health care
 
05:03:29.510 --> 05:03:29.520 align:start position:0%

05:03:34.788 --> 05:03:34.798 align:start position:0%
covet 19 victims and survivors memorial
 
05:03:37.110 --> 05:03:37.120 align:start position:0%
day can be one of the days we remember
 
05:03:39.430 --> 05:03:39.440 align:start position:0%
not only the fathers the mothers the
 
05:03:41.990 --> 05:03:42.000 align:start position:0%

05:04:42.390 --> 05:04:42.400 align:start position:0%
hb 1443 is a way to create a present and
 
05:04:45.750 --> 05:04:45.760 align:start position:0%
future space for mourning remembrance
 
05:04:47.990 --> 05:04:48.000 align:start position:0%
and ongoing discussion
 
05:04:49.830 --> 05:04:49.840 align:start position:0%
it's also a way to let the health care
 
05:04:51.670 --> 05:04:51.680 align:start position:0%
heroes in our hospitals know that we are
 
05:04:51.680 --> 05:04:52.868 align:start position:0%

low pay and a shortage of ppe
 
05:04:59.430 --> 05:04:59.440 align:start position:0%
stayed on the job protecting our most
 
05:05:01.510 --> 05:05:01.520 align:start position:0%
vulnerable residents
 
05:05:03.270 --> 05:05:03.280 align:start position:0%
to acknowledge the essential workers who
 
05:05:04.868 --> 05:05:04.878 align:start position:0%
kept our economy going through the
 
05:05:06.550 --> 05:05:06.560 align:start position:0%
darkest days
 
05:05:09.190 --> 05:05:09.200 align:start position:0%
and to remember the first responders
 
05:05:11.510 --> 05:05:11.520 align:start position:0%
public health care workers and citizen
 
05:05:13.990 --> 05:05:14.000 align:start position:0%
volunteers who did the work of getting

05:05:16.320 --> 05:05:17.750 align:start position:0%
the vaccine to people when they needed
it

05:05:17.750 --> 05:05:17.760 align:start position:0%
it
 
05:05:19.430 --> 05:05:19.440 align:start position:0%
passing this bill will send a message
 
05:05:20.948 --> 05:05:20.958 align:start position:0%
that new hampshire and new hampshire's
 
05:05:23.270 --> 05:05:23.280 align:start position:0%
leaders will not forget the people who
 
05:05:24.470 --> 05:05:24.480 align:start position:0%
were lost
 
05:05:26.470 --> 05:05:26.480 align:start position:0%
the people who suffered
 
05:05:28.070 --> 05:05:28.080 align:start position:0%
and the people who at great risk to
 
05:05:30.628 --> 05:05:30.638 align:start position:0%
themselves found ways to help others
 
05:05:32.708 --> 05:05:32.718 align:start position:0%
and to keep helping
 
05:05:34.070 --> 05:05:34.080 align:start position:0%
and many of those people are still
 
05:05:35.830 --> 05:05:35.840 align:start position:0%
helping today
 
05:05:38.708 --> 05:05:38.718 align:start position:0%
so i ask you to uh to please uh give
 
05:05:39.830 --> 05:05:39.840 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
05:05:44.230 --> 05:05:44.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:45.830 --> 05:05:45.840 align:start position:0%
thank you representative muse are there
 
05:05:47.910 --> 05:05:47.920 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
05:05:49.830 --> 05:05:49.840 align:start position:0%
representative shua
 
05:05:51.990 --> 05:05:52.000 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um
 
05:05:54.470 --> 05:05:54.480 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure if this is a question for
 
05:05:57.030 --> 05:05:57.040 align:start position:0%
the sponsor or for the chair
 
05:05:59.030 --> 05:05:59.040 align:start position:0%
the bill calls for
 
05:06:01.510 --> 05:06:01.520 align:start position:0%
the governor to order the flag of the
 
05:06:04.550 --> 05:06:04.560 align:start position:0%
united states to have staff am i correct
 
05:06:06.628 --> 05:06:06.638 align:start position:0%
that only the president can do that i
 
05:06:08.470 --> 05:06:08.480 align:start position:0%
think the governor only controls the
 
05:06:12.390 --> 05:06:12.400 align:start position:0%
state and state flag
 
05:06:14.070 --> 05:06:14.080 align:start position:0%
excellent question does anyone know the
 
05:06:14.080 --> 05:06:15.110 align:start position:0%
excellent question does anyone know the
answer

05:06:15.110 --> 05:06:15.120 align:start position:0%
answer
 
05:06:17.830 --> 05:06:17.840 align:start position:0%
representative o'brien
 
05:06:20.150 --> 05:06:20.160 align:start position:0%
i assume that the governor does have the
 
05:06:22.948 --> 05:06:22.958 align:start position:0%
authority to lower the flag but in
 
05:06:25.910 --> 05:06:25.920 align:start position:0%
further reference there is a flag code
 
05:06:29.030 --> 05:06:29.040 align:start position:0%
that is referenced through uh defense
 
05:06:30.948 --> 05:06:30.958 align:start position:0%
that you'll be able to research that and
 
05:06:34.310 --> 05:06:34.320 align:start position:0%
valid validate your inquiry
 
05:06:35.750 --> 05:06:35.760 align:start position:0%
thank you for saying muse did you
 
05:06:38.310 --> 05:06:38.320 align:start position:0%
research that before you uh said you
 
05:06:39.430 --> 05:06:39.440 align:start position:0%
wrote the bill
 
05:06:42.150 --> 05:06:42.160 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry did you research
 
05:06:44.150 --> 05:06:44.160 align:start position:0%
that question
 
05:06:46.310 --> 05:06:46.320 align:start position:0%
when you were looking into this uh what
 
05:06:48.470 --> 05:06:48.480 align:start position:0%
i what i did do is i looked at some of
 
05:06:49.990 --> 05:06:50.000 align:start position:0%
the other statutes or some of the other
 
05:06:51.510 --> 05:06:51.520 align:start position:0%
days and basically mirrored that
 
05:06:51.520 --> 05:06:52.390 align:start position:0%
days and basically mirrored that
language

05:06:52.390 --> 05:06:52.400 align:start position:0%
language
 
05:06:54.150 --> 05:06:54.160 align:start position:0%
so if there's a issue with this bill
 
05:06:56.470 --> 05:06:56.480 align:start position:0%
there's an issue with the language and
 
05:06:57.590 --> 05:06:57.600 align:start position:0%
some of the other things that we've
 
05:06:58.788 --> 05:06:58.798 align:start position:0%
already passed
 
05:06:59.990 --> 05:07:00.000 align:start position:0%
thank you that's
 
05:07:05.110 --> 05:07:05.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:08.150 --> 05:07:08.160 align:start position:0%
any other questions representative phil
 
05:07:11.190 --> 05:07:11.200 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um i just can you
 
05:07:13.830 --> 05:07:13.840 align:start position:0%
tell me why you selected this particular
 
05:07:16.868 --> 05:07:16.878 align:start position:0%
date the first monday in
 
05:07:19.750 --> 05:07:19.760 align:start position:0%
march i'm just wondering if it aligned
 
05:07:19.760 --> 05:07:20.708 align:start position:0%
march i'm just wondering if it aligned
with

05:07:20.708 --> 05:07:20.718 align:start position:0%
with
 
05:07:22.230 --> 05:07:22.240 align:start position:0%
a federal
 
05:07:24.550 --> 05:07:24.560 align:start position:0%
celebration or not celebration
 
05:07:24.560 --> 05:07:26.070 align:start position:0%
celebration or not celebration
recognition

05:07:26.070 --> 05:07:26.080 align:start position:0%
recognition
 
05:07:28.628 --> 05:07:28.638 align:start position:0%
i think it syncs with the day i think
 
05:07:30.470 --> 05:07:30.480 align:start position:0%
that most of us realize that this was
 
05:07:32.830 --> 05:07:32.840 align:start position:0%
going to be a serious problem
 
05:07:34.070 --> 05:07:34.080 align:start position:0%
um uh
 
05:07:36.628 --> 05:07:36.638 align:start position:0%
we i think we're meeting after that i
 
05:07:38.070 --> 05:07:38.080 align:start position:0%
think we met during the first week in
 
05:07:40.550 --> 05:07:40.560 align:start position:0%
march and we had that 20-hour session
 
05:07:42.470 --> 05:07:42.480 align:start position:0%
uh because we knew that there wasn't
 
05:07:44.230 --> 05:07:44.240 align:start position:0%
going to there may not be another one
 
05:07:46.470 --> 05:07:46.480 align:start position:0%
for a long time based on the way that
 
05:07:48.708 --> 05:07:48.718 align:start position:0%
the the illness was going
 
05:07:51.910 --> 05:07:51.920 align:start position:0%
so march of 2020 is generally the time
 
05:07:54.550 --> 05:07:54.560 align:start position:0%
frame i think that has been accepted for
 
05:07:57.350 --> 05:07:57.360 align:start position:0%
the start of the covet 19 pandemic in
 
05:07:59.190 --> 05:07:59.200 align:start position:0%
the united states
 
05:08:01.030 --> 05:08:01.040 align:start position:0%
and that's the reason for selecting
 
05:08:03.830 --> 05:08:03.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:06.868 --> 05:08:06.878 align:start position:0%
thank you other questions
 
05:08:08.788 --> 05:08:08.798 align:start position:0%

indigenous people's indigenous day on
 
05:31:01.350 --> 05:31:01.360 align:start position:0%
august 9th and
 
05:31:03.590 --> 05:31:03.600 align:start position:0%
i was overwhelmingly approved in the
 
05:31:05.830 --> 05:31:05.840 align:start position:0%
town of chester
 
05:31:08.070 --> 05:31:08.080 align:start position:0%
you may recall it from last year that
 
05:31:10.070 --> 05:31:10.080 align:start position:0%
the bill has introduced
 
05:31:12.390 --> 05:31:12.400 align:start position:0%
proposed putting into just indigenous
 
05:31:13.670 --> 05:31:13.680 align:start position:0%
people's day
 
05:31:17.190 --> 05:31:17.200 align:start position:0%
on the same day as columbus day
 
05:31:17.200 --> 05:31:18.948 align:start position:0%
on the same day as columbus day
and

05:31:18.948 --> 05:31:18.958 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:31:21.670 --> 05:31:21.680 align:start position:0%
i submitted an amendment last year to
 
05:31:23.350 --> 05:31:23.360 align:start position:0%
just say
 
05:31:24.788 --> 05:31:24.798 align:start position:0%
let's go ahead and move indigenous
 
05:31:26.708 --> 05:31:26.718 align:start position:0%
people's day over to
 
05:31:29.110 --> 05:31:29.120 align:start position:0%
the u.n day and
 
05:31:30.628 --> 05:31:30.638 align:start position:0%
this committee i think it was this
 
05:31:30.638 --> 05:31:31.830 align:start position:0%
this committee i think it was this
committee

05:31:31.830 --> 05:31:31.840 align:start position:0%
committee
 
05:31:34.390 --> 05:31:34.400 align:start position:0%
approved that overwhelmingly
 
05:31:36.470 --> 05:31:36.480 align:start position:0%
i i think it is
 
05:31:36.480 --> 05:31:37.590 align:start position:0%
i i think it is
because

05:31:37.590 --> 05:31:37.600 align:start position:0%
because
 
05:31:39.030 --> 05:31:39.040 align:start position:0%
we've had this
 
05:31:39.040 --> 05:31:40.310 align:start position:0%
we've had this
fight

05:31:40.310 --> 05:31:40.320 align:start position:0%
fight
 
05:31:41.910 --> 05:31:41.920 align:start position:0%
for so long
 
05:31:44.708 --> 05:31:44.718 align:start position:0%
about whether or not
 
05:31:46.868 --> 05:31:46.878 align:start position:0%
columbus deserves to be part of our
 
05:31:49.030 --> 05:31:49.040 align:start position:0%
history and if we could get rid of
 
05:31:49.040 --> 05:31:50.390 align:start position:0%
history and if we could get rid of
columbus

05:31:50.390 --> 05:31:50.400 align:start position:0%
columbus
 
05:31:50.400 --> 05:31:51.270 align:start position:0%
columbus
by

05:31:51.270 --> 05:31:51.280 align:start position:0%
by
 
05:31:51.280 --> 05:31:52.948 align:start position:0%
by
overwriting

05:31:52.948 --> 05:31:52.958 align:start position:0%
overwriting
 
05:31:54.548 --> 05:31:54.558 align:start position:0%
that history
 
05:31:56.948 --> 05:31:56.958 align:start position:0%
with indigenous people's day this was a
 
05:31:59.430 --> 05:31:59.440 align:start position:0%
way to kill two birds with one stone i
 
05:31:59.440 --> 05:32:00.548 align:start position:0%
way to kill two birds with one stone i
believe

05:32:00.548 --> 05:32:00.558 align:start position:0%
believe
 
05:32:03.270 --> 05:32:03.280 align:start position:0%
and what i think would be a healthier
 
05:32:05.110 --> 05:32:05.120 align:start position:0%
thing for us to do
 
05:32:07.270 --> 05:32:07.280 align:start position:0%
is to give up on
 
05:32:09.510 --> 05:32:09.520 align:start position:0%
the intersectional wars
 
05:32:12.868 --> 05:32:12.878 align:start position:0%
and just recognize that
 
05:32:15.030 --> 05:32:15.040 align:start position:0%
american indigenous peoples and in new
 
05:32:17.910 --> 05:32:17.920 align:start position:0%
hampshire that would include the abunaki
 
05:32:17.920 --> 05:32:19.110 align:start position:0%
hampshire that would include the abunaki
that

05:32:19.110 --> 05:32:19.120 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:32:22.230 --> 05:32:22.240 align:start position:0%
if we are to respect them as we are to
 
05:32:24.230 --> 05:32:24.240 align:start position:0%
respect each other
 
05:32:27.430 --> 05:32:27.440 align:start position:0%
that we would go ahead and designate a
 
05:32:30.868 --> 05:32:30.878 align:start position:0%
date of recognition for them
 
05:32:33.190 --> 05:32:33.200 align:start position:0%
and uh have it coincide with the
 
05:32:34.548 --> 05:32:34.558 align:start position:0%
the un day
 
05:32:37.110 --> 05:32:37.120 align:start position:0%
now in the u.n um
 
05:32:39.628 --> 05:32:39.638 align:start position:0%
that day recognizes for
 
05:32:43.190 --> 05:32:43.200 align:start position:0%
460 million people around the world
 
05:32:45.110 --> 05:32:45.120 align:start position:0%
that's a whole lot of people
 
05:32:48.230 --> 05:32:48.240 align:start position:0%
and so i think
 
05:32:49.990 --> 05:32:50.000 align:start position:0%
this is a way
 
05:32:51.990 --> 05:32:52.000 align:start position:0%
in a healthier way
 
05:32:54.708 --> 05:32:54.718 align:start position:0%
to accomplish a couple things with one
 
05:32:54.718 --> 05:32:55.590 align:start position:0%
to accomplish a couple things with one
bill

05:32:55.590 --> 05:32:55.600 align:start position:0%
bill
 
05:32:58.628 --> 05:32:58.638 align:start position:0%
we can finally end four or five years of
 
05:33:00.150 --> 05:33:00.160 align:start position:0%
fighting over whether or not we're going
 
05:33:01.750 --> 05:33:01.760 align:start position:0%
to have an indigenous people's day
 
05:33:03.270 --> 05:33:03.280 align:start position:0%
because we can just acknowledge it and
 
05:33:04.788 --> 05:33:04.798 align:start position:0%
do it
 
05:33:08.150 --> 05:33:08.160 align:start position:0%
and while doing that we could recognize
 
05:33:10.230 --> 05:33:10.240 align:start position:0%
the united nations effort there are
 
05:33:12.150 --> 05:33:12.160 align:start position:0%
there aren't very many times where i
 
05:33:14.548 --> 05:33:14.558 align:start position:0%
support the united nations in general
 
05:33:16.230 --> 05:33:16.240 align:start position:0%
because i think they're poorly led and
 
05:33:18.628 --> 05:33:18.638 align:start position:0%
poorly organized but but this is one
 
05:33:20.868 --> 05:33:20.878 align:start position:0%
thing i think we could
 
05:33:20.878 --> 05:33:21.990 align:start position:0%
thing i think we could
accept

05:33:21.990 --> 05:33:22.000 align:start position:0%
accept
 
05:33:22.000 --> 05:33:23.190 align:start position:0%
accept
from

05:33:23.190 --> 05:33:23.200 align:start position:0%
from
 
05:33:25.190 --> 05:33:25.200 align:start position:0%
that global entity
 
05:33:25.200 --> 05:33:27.510 align:start position:0%
that global entity
and

05:33:27.510 --> 05:33:27.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:33:30.390 --> 05:33:30.400 align:start position:0%
i believe that's everything i i think i
 
05:33:32.470 --> 05:33:32.480 align:start position:0%
should say at this point i wasn't
 
05:33:34.628 --> 05:33:34.638 align:start position:0%
prepared to introduce the bill but i'm
 
05:33:36.230 --> 05:33:36.240 align:start position:0%
happy to do so if there are any
 
05:33:38.788 --> 05:33:38.798 align:start position:0%
questions i'm i'm also happy to take
 
05:33:38.798 --> 05:33:41.190 align:start position:0%
questions i'm i'm also happy to take
them

05:33:41.190 --> 05:33:41.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:42.390 --> 05:33:42.400 align:start position:0%
thank you representative edwards
 
05:33:45.670 --> 05:33:45.680 align:start position:0%
representative schmidt has a question
 
05:33:47.590 --> 05:33:47.600 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
05:33:49.350 --> 05:33:49.360 align:start position:0%

vice chair um
 
05:33:52.798 --> 05:33:53.670 align:start position:0%
vice chair um
so

05:33:53.670 --> 05:33:53.680 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:33:56.070 --> 05:33:56.080 align:start position:0%
where are the indigenous people on this
 
05:33:58.310 --> 05:33:58.320 align:start position:0%
bill because as you know they
 
05:33:59.910 --> 05:33:59.920 align:start position:0%
uh they were not
 
05:34:03.110 --> 05:34:03.120 align:start position:0%
uh totally unanimous in their
 
05:34:05.110 --> 05:34:05.120 align:start position:0%
ass in their attitude
 
05:34:05.120 --> 05:34:05.910 align:start position:0%
ass in their attitude
uh

05:34:05.910 --> 05:34:05.920 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:34:08.628 --> 05:34:08.638 align:start position:0%
about this the last time we tried it uh
 
05:34:10.390 --> 05:34:10.400 align:start position:0%
and i don't see any of them here and i
 
05:34:12.548 --> 05:34:12.558 align:start position:0%
haven't heard from any of them so i
 
05:34:14.070 --> 05:34:14.080 align:start position:0%
don't want to assume anything maybe you
 
05:34:15.750 --> 05:34:15.760 align:start position:0%
have heard something
 
05:34:16.868 --> 05:34:16.878 align:start position:0%
this is what i think i know
 
05:34:18.788 --> 05:34:18.798 align:start position:0%
representative schmidt um thank you for
 
05:34:21.510 --> 05:34:21.520 align:start position:0%
the question i what i what i think is
 
05:34:23.430 --> 05:34:23.440 align:start position:0%
that the representative who may be
 
05:34:25.270 --> 05:34:25.280 align:start position:0%
speaking after me
 
05:34:27.910 --> 05:34:27.920 align:start position:0%
has maintained as i understand it close
 
05:34:32.230 --> 05:34:32.240 align:start position:0%
contact with the abunaki and that
 
05:34:34.708 --> 05:34:34.718 align:start position:0%
based on the testimony we heard last
 
05:34:34.718 --> 05:34:36.310 align:start position:0%
based on the testimony we heard last
year

05:34:36.310 --> 05:34:36.320 align:start position:0%
year
 
05:34:38.708 --> 05:34:38.718 align:start position:0%
i think that their official position
 
05:34:40.390 --> 05:34:40.400 align:start position:0%
would be that they would still want to
 
05:34:42.948 --> 05:34:42.958 align:start position:0%
keep it on columbus day
 
05:34:44.470 --> 05:34:44.480 align:start position:0%
and um
 
05:34:46.548 --> 05:34:46.558 align:start position:0%
and i i'm just saying
 
05:34:48.070 --> 05:34:48.080 align:start position:0%
i love you
 
05:34:51.350 --> 05:34:51.360 align:start position:0%
let's let's figure out how to agree to
 
05:34:51.360 --> 05:34:52.390 align:start position:0%
let's let's figure out how to agree to
agree

05:34:52.390 --> 05:34:52.400 align:start position:0%
agree
 
05:34:54.868 --> 05:34:54.878 align:start position:0%
and let's go ahead and give you your day
 
05:34:57.110 --> 05:34:57.120 align:start position:0%
but let's make it with the u.n
 
05:34:59.910 --> 05:34:59.920 align:start position:0%
and not continue to fight against what
 
05:35:01.190 --> 05:35:01.200 align:start position:0%
has become
 
05:35:04.070 --> 05:35:04.080 align:start position:0%
a celebration of italian immigration to
 
05:35:07.030 --> 05:35:07.040 align:start position:0%
the united states so so that's a very
 
05:35:11.430 --> 05:35:11.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:13.510 --> 05:35:13.520 align:start position:0%
i think you're probably right but but we
 
05:35:14.948 --> 05:35:14.958 align:start position:0%
ought to ask them
 
05:35:17.030 --> 05:35:17.040 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
05:35:19.030 --> 05:35:19.040 align:start position:0%
thank you representative edwards thank
 
05:35:31.830 --> 05:35:31.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:33.190 --> 05:35:33.200 align:start position:0%
thank you very much madam chair thank
 
05:35:34.708 --> 05:35:34.718 align:start position:0%
you much for the committee it's actually
 
05:35:36.150 --> 05:35:36.160 align:start position:0%
somewhat unusual for someone who's
 
05:35:37.430 --> 05:35:37.440 align:start position:0%
sitting around the committee table to
 
05:35:39.110 --> 05:35:39.120 align:start position:0%
fill out the pink card and speak against
 
05:35:39.120 --> 05:35:40.310 align:start position:0%
fill out the pink card and speak against
because

05:35:40.310 --> 05:35:40.320 align:start position:0%
because
 
05:35:40.320 --> 05:35:41.430 align:start position:0%
because
normally

05:35:41.430 --> 05:35:41.440 align:start position:0%
normally
 
05:35:43.030 --> 05:35:43.040 align:start position:0%
we're supposed to save the negative
 
05:35:45.190 --> 05:35:45.200 align:start position:0%
comments for the executive session but i
 
05:35:46.788 --> 05:35:46.798 align:start position:0%
don't even i'm just a substitute so i'm
 
05:35:48.548 --> 05:35:48.558 align:start position:0%
just here for the day so i probably
 
05:35:50.788 --> 05:35:50.798 align:start position:0%
won't be here when it's exact whenever
 
05:35:52.948 --> 05:35:52.958 align:start position:0%
and um
 
05:35:54.548 --> 05:35:54.558 align:start position:0%
and um so
 
05:35:55.350 --> 05:35:55.360 align:start position:0%
and i
 
05:35:57.750 --> 05:35:57.760 align:start position:0%
i seem to be the only uh person who's
 
05:35:59.430 --> 05:35:59.440 align:start position:0%
come up to testify against the bill but
 
05:36:01.110 --> 05:36:01.120 align:start position:0%
i have been whether or not it's close
 
05:36:02.628 --> 05:36:02.638 align:start position:0%
contact like for example i was just
 
05:36:04.070 --> 05:36:04.080 align:start position:0%
checking a facebook change i did
 
05:36:06.310 --> 05:36:06.320 align:start position:0%
encourage people to upload their
 
05:36:08.310 --> 05:36:08.320 align:start position:0%
opposition to the website um i haven't
 
05:36:10.868 --> 05:36:10.878 align:start position:0%
checked to see how many did but um
 
05:36:12.070 --> 05:36:12.080 align:start position:0%
and i've uh
 
05:36:13.750 --> 05:36:13.760 align:start position:0%
supported sponsored several bills
 
05:36:15.270 --> 05:36:15.280 align:start position:0%
related indigenous people's day
 
05:36:17.910 --> 05:36:17.920 align:start position:0%
including including one just uh
 
05:36:19.270 --> 05:36:19.280 align:start position:0%
last year which was tabled as
 
05:36:21.990 --> 05:36:22.000 align:start position:0%
representative edwards correctly noted
 
05:36:22.000 --> 05:36:23.350 align:start position:0%
representative edwards correctly noted
and

05:36:23.350 --> 05:36:23.360 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:36:24.470 --> 05:36:24.480 align:start position:0%
this day
 
05:36:26.788 --> 05:36:26.798 align:start position:0%
those are the first monday in october
 
05:36:29.030 --> 05:36:29.040 align:start position:0%
which is the same day as the columbus
 
05:36:30.948 --> 05:36:30.958 align:start position:0%
day holiday is um it's already being
 
05:36:33.030 --> 05:36:33.040 align:start position:0%
observed as indigenous people's day by
 
05:36:34.788 --> 05:36:34.798 align:start position:0%
the native community and its allies
 
05:36:37.190 --> 05:36:37.200 align:start position:0%
including myself officially celebrated
 
05:36:38.230 --> 05:36:38.240 align:start position:0%
you know
 
05:36:40.230 --> 05:36:40.240 align:start position:0%
in many communities across new hampshire
 
05:36:42.310 --> 05:36:42.320 align:start position:0%
including my own hometown of durham and
 
05:36:43.750 --> 05:36:43.760 align:start position:0%
our local school district the oyster
 
05:36:45.430 --> 05:36:45.440 align:start position:0%
river school district who actually one
 
05:36:48.390 --> 05:36:48.400 align:start position:0%
of the first in the state to uh
 
05:36:50.470 --> 05:36:50.480 align:start position:0%
observe uh indigenous people's day in
 
05:36:53.110 --> 05:36:53.120 align:start position:0%
october and this october celebration is
 
05:36:54.948 --> 05:36:54.958 align:start position:0%
very much specifically a celebration of
 
05:36:56.628 --> 05:36:56.638 align:start position:0%
the first nations of
 
05:36:58.470 --> 05:36:58.480 align:start position:0%
what we now know is the united states of
 
05:36:58.480 --> 05:37:00.230 align:start position:0%
what we now know is the united states of
america

05:37:00.230 --> 05:37:00.240 align:start position:0%
america
 
05:37:01.910 --> 05:37:01.920 align:start position:0%
and i guess it is also specifically
 
05:37:04.070 --> 05:37:04.080 align:start position:0%
repudiation christopher columbus and you
 
05:37:06.390 --> 05:37:06.400 align:start position:0%
know well he's a historical figure about
 
05:37:06.400 --> 05:37:07.350 align:start position:0%
know well he's a historical figure about
uh

05:37:07.350 --> 05:37:07.360 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:37:09.110 --> 05:37:09.120 align:start position:0%
who symbolizes lots of things lots of
 
05:37:10.868 --> 05:37:10.878 align:start position:0%
people we actually don't know very much
 
05:37:13.430 --> 05:37:13.440 align:start position:0%
about him but um
 
05:37:15.750 --> 05:37:15.760 align:start position:0%
and uh so august 9th as representative
 
05:37:17.830 --> 05:37:17.840 align:start position:0%
edwards correctly noted the united
 
05:37:19.670 --> 05:37:19.680 align:start position:0%
nations international day of the world's
 
05:37:21.910 --> 05:37:21.920 align:start position:0%
indigenous peoples it's worthwhile but
 
05:37:24.390 --> 05:37:24.400 align:start position:0%
somewhat obscure observance
 
05:37:25.990 --> 05:37:26.000 align:start position:0%
it's not a holiday anywhere i don't
 
05:37:27.670 --> 05:37:27.680 align:start position:0%
think it's widely celebrated anywhere
 
05:37:29.110 --> 05:37:29.120 align:start position:0%
it's really only one step up of
 
05:37:30.868 --> 05:37:30.878 align:start position:0%
significance from national book lovers
 
05:37:30.878 --> 05:37:31.750 align:start position:0%
significance from national book lovers
day

05:37:31.750 --> 05:37:31.760 align:start position:0%
day
 
05:37:34.150 --> 05:37:34.160 align:start position:0%
or national rice pudding day which are
 
05:37:36.868 --> 05:37:36.878 align:start position:0%
which are also celebrated on august 9th
 
05:37:38.390 --> 05:37:38.400 align:start position:0%
and actually like many other people i
 
05:37:40.548 --> 05:37:40.558 align:start position:0%
love books and i enjoy eating rice
 
05:37:41.750 --> 05:37:41.760 align:start position:0%
pudding but
 
05:37:43.430 --> 05:37:43.440 align:start position:0%
those celebrations don't deserve to be a
 
05:37:45.830 --> 05:37:45.840 align:start position:0%
subject of a new hampshire bill such as
 
05:37:48.788 --> 05:37:48.798 align:start position:0%
hb 1173 and in my opinion the same goes
 
05:37:50.470 --> 05:37:50.480 align:start position:0%
for the u.n international day of the
 
05:37:53.510 --> 05:37:53.520 align:start position:0%
world's indigenous peoples some
 
05:37:55.590 --> 05:37:55.600 align:start position:0%
um you know it's yeah it's a bit of a
 
05:37:57.430 --> 05:37:57.440 align:start position:0%
cop-out you know like
 
05:37:59.030 --> 05:37:59.040 align:start position:0%
you know because we uh the october
 
05:38:00.310 --> 05:38:00.320 align:start position:0%
celebration is very much about the
 
05:38:02.070 --> 05:38:02.080 align:start position:0%
indigenous peoples of you know united
 
05:38:03.590 --> 05:38:03.600 align:start position:0%
states and canada and you know north
 
05:38:05.430 --> 05:38:05.440 align:start position:0%
america so it's not about indigenous
 
05:38:06.628 --> 05:38:06.638 align:start position:0%
people the rest of the world even though
 
05:38:09.030 --> 05:38:09.040 align:start position:0%
they all have their own stories
 
05:38:12.310 --> 05:38:12.320 align:start position:0%
if this bill practice passes we'd also
 
05:38:14.230 --> 05:38:14.240 align:start position:0%
be breaking the general court would be
 
05:38:16.070 --> 05:38:16.080 align:start position:0%
breaking 75 years of practice and
 
05:38:16.080 --> 05:38:17.670 align:start position:0%
breaking 75 years of practice and
precedent

05:38:17.670 --> 05:38:17.680 align:start position:0%
precedent
 
05:38:19.510 --> 05:38:19.520 align:start position:0%
there is an unwritten rule but it's been
 
05:38:22.230 --> 05:38:22.240 align:start position:0%
i think fairly unanimously it's been
 
05:38:24.628 --> 05:38:24.638 align:start position:0%
quite faithfully followed that all bills
 
05:38:26.070 --> 05:38:26.080 align:start position:0%
and resolutions
 
05:38:27.670 --> 05:38:27.680 align:start position:0%
which say good things about the un
 
05:38:30.310 --> 05:38:30.320 align:start position:0%
should be killed uh we're not and uh so
 
05:38:33.110 --> 05:38:33.120 align:start position:0%
please uphold this tradition by itlling
 
05:38:37.590 --> 05:38:37.600 align:start position:0%
hp 1173 or or alternatively amended to
 
05:38:39.030 --> 05:38:39.040 align:start position:0%
the day which is actually celebrated
 
05:38:40.470 --> 05:38:40.480 align:start position:0%
here in new hampshire which is the first
 
05:38:42.070 --> 05:38:42.080 align:start position:0%
monday in october but i don't think the
 
05:38:44.708 --> 05:38:44.718 align:start position:0%
time is ripe for that and that's um
 
05:38:46.708 --> 05:38:46.718 align:start position:0%
and we have to ask answer any questions
 
05:38:48.548 --> 05:38:48.558 align:start position:0%
if you'd like thank you are there any
 
05:38:51.750 --> 05:38:51.760 align:start position:0%

05:38:53.830 --> 05:38:53.840 align:start position:0%

05:39:10.070 --> 05:39:10.080 align:start position:0%

05:41:15.990 --> 05:41:16.000 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
05:41:17.990 --> 05:41:18.000 align:start position:0%
it is also a disservice to the students
 
05:41:19.670 --> 05:41:19.680 align:start position:0%
who are being lied to by sending
 
05:41:22.470 --> 05:41:22.480 align:start position:0%
messages that columbus has done good why
 
05:41:24.628 --> 05:41:24.638 align:start position:0%
else would be would there be a holiday
 
05:41:26.628 --> 05:41:26.638 align:start position:0%
to be named after him
 
05:41:28.070 --> 05:41:28.080 align:start position:0%
i think it's really important that as a
 
05:41:29.990 --> 05:41:30.000 align:start position:0%
community we change columbus day to
 
05:41:32.390 --> 05:41:32.400 align:start position:0%
indigenous people's day as a correction
 
05:41:35.190 --> 05:41:35.200 align:start position:0%
for past historical inaccuracies
 
05:41:38.230 --> 05:41:38.240 align:start position:0%
as a libyan american i'd love to see the
 
05:41:40.470 --> 05:41:40.480 align:start position:0%
day when people like me are celebrated
 
05:41:41.830 --> 05:41:41.840 align:start position:0%
in this country
 
05:41:43.830 --> 05:41:43.840 align:start position:0%
unlike the italians
 
05:41:45.990 --> 05:41:46.000 align:start position:0%
who have been mostly accepted into
 
05:41:47.750 --> 05:41:47.760 align:start position:0%
mainstream american culture we are
 
05:41:50.830 --> 05:41:50.840 align:start position:0%
oftentimes stigmatized and made fun of
 
05:41:54.070 --> 05:41:54.080 align:start position:0%
still but if a libyan participated in a
 
05:41:56.070 --> 05:41:56.080 align:start position:0%
violent act the last thing i would want
 
05:41:58.868 --> 05:41:58.878 align:start position:0%
to do is associate my culture
 
05:42:02.230 --> 05:42:02.240 align:start position:0%
or my libyan pride with the violence nor
 
05:42:04.708 --> 05:42:04.718 align:start position:0%
would i ever want a day associated with
 
05:42:07.190 --> 05:42:07.200 align:start position:0%
a violent history caused by someone from
 
05:42:10.070 --> 05:42:10.080 align:start position:0%
my culture to be used to celebrate us as
 
05:42:12.150 --> 05:42:12.160 align:start position:0%
a people
 
05:42:14.150 --> 05:42:14.160 align:start position:0%
as that really does not make sense in
 
05:42:14.160 --> 05:42:15.590 align:start position:0%
as that really does not make sense in
logic

05:42:15.590 --> 05:42:15.600 align:start position:0%
logic
 
05:42:17.670 --> 05:42:17.680 align:start position:0%
i believe we can move our communities
 
05:42:19.830 --> 05:42:19.840 align:start position:0%
towards healing past mistakes and
 
05:42:22.070 --> 05:42:22.080 align:start position:0%
teaching students and community members
 
05:42:24.868 --> 05:42:24.878 align:start position:0%
that the project of america was a messy
 
05:42:24.878 --> 05:42:25.670 align:start position:0%
that the project of america was a messy
one

05:42:25.670 --> 05:42:25.680 align:start position:0%
one
 
05:42:27.670 --> 05:42:27.680 align:start position:0%
and we must not run away from our past
 
05:42:30.310 --> 05:42:30.320 align:start position:0%
mistakes we need to acknowledge them and
 
05:42:32.470 --> 05:42:32.480 align:start position:0%
we can try to repair them
 
05:42:35.030 --> 05:42:35.040 align:start position:0%
i am confident that we can do that as a
 
05:42:37.350 --> 05:42:37.360 align:start position:0%
community so please
 
05:42:39.110 --> 05:42:39.120 align:start position:0%
do not pass this we don't need another
 
05:42:41.590 --> 05:42:41.600 align:start position:0%
day we can't be honoring violence
 
05:42:43.190 --> 05:42:43.200 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
05:42:46.548 --> 05:42:46.558 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any questions
 
05:42:48.150 --> 05:42:48.160 align:start position:0%

representative lucas
 
05:43:15.670 --> 05:43:15.680 align:start position:0%

05:43:19.990 --> 05:43:20.000 align:start position:0%

05:43:56.470 --> 05:43:56.480 align:start position:0%
i emailed it but i think it
 
05:44:04.310 --> 05:44:04.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:08.788 --> 05:44:08.798 align:start position:0%

05:44:22.160 --> 05:44:31.910 align:start position:0%
 
correct

05:44:31.910 --> 05:44:31.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:31.920 --> 05:44:32.948 align:start position:0%
 
okay

05:44:32.948 --> 05:44:32.958 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:44:35.510 --> 05:44:35.520 align:start position:0%
madam chair who was the second
 
05:45:07.350 --> 05:45:07.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:09.590 --> 05:45:09.600 align:start position:0%
so now we've all had our papers shuffled
 
05:45:12.310 --> 05:45:12.320 align:start position:0%
a representation speak to your motion
 
05:45:16.310 --> 05:45:16.320 align:start position:0%
uh yes thank you um
 
05:45:18.310 --> 05:45:18.320 align:start position:0%
there are a couple parts of this one
 
05:45:19.100 --> 05:45:19.110 align:start position:0%
which we're
 
05:45:19.110 --> 05:45:20.830 align:start position:0%
which we're
[Music]

05:45:20.830 --> 05:45:20.840 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
05:45:24.070 --> 05:45:24.080 align:start position:0%
um not changing that if people recall
 
05:45:26.070 --> 05:45:26.080 align:start position:0%
this allows a uh
 
05:45:29.030 --> 05:45:29.040 align:start position:0%
a real estate broker who um
 
05:45:33.110 --> 05:45:33.120 align:start position:0%
performs some service which their
 
05:45:35.350 --> 05:45:35.360 align:start position:0%
their contract would provide them with
 
05:45:37.510 --> 05:45:37.520 align:start position:0%
deferred compensation compensation over
 
05:45:39.830 --> 05:45:39.840 align:start position:0%
time could continue to receive that
 
05:45:39.840 --> 05:45:42.470 align:start position:0%
time could continue to receive that
compensation

05:45:42.470 --> 05:45:42.480 align:start position:0%
compensation
 
05:45:43.990 --> 05:45:44.000 align:start position:0%
even after
 
05:45:45.830 --> 05:45:45.840 align:start position:0%
they were no longer active but the
 
05:45:49.030 --> 05:45:49.040 align:start position:0%
amendment deals with
 
05:45:52.628 --> 05:45:52.638 align:start position:0%
the licensure accepting licenses from
 
05:45:54.948 --> 05:45:54.958 align:start position:0%
other jurisdictions
 
05:45:58.070 --> 05:45:58.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:59.750 --> 05:45:59.760 align:start position:0%
we had a discussion that there's if you
 
05:46:01.990 --> 05:46:02.000 align:start position:0%
look on the original bill at on the
 
05:46:05.270 --> 05:46:05.280 align:start position:0%
first page online 27 there's a section
 
05:46:08.150 --> 05:46:08.160 align:start position:0%
that says this section applies to
 
05:46:10.150 --> 05:46:10.160 align:start position:0%
non-resident salesperson and broker
 
05:46:11.750 --> 05:46:11.760 align:start position:0%
applicants only
 
05:46:13.030 --> 05:46:13.040 align:start position:0%
there was some discussion that there
 
05:46:14.708 --> 05:46:14.718 align:start position:0%
were that word wasn't needed and
 
05:46:16.788 --> 05:46:16.798 align:start position:0%
potentially caused problems
 
05:46:20.628 --> 05:46:20.638 align:start position:0%
and um and so the amendment removes it
 
05:46:22.390 --> 05:46:22.400 align:start position:0%
there were a couple there was a mix in
 
05:46:25.670 --> 05:46:25.680 align:start position:0%
the bill of using the words uh taken and
 
05:46:28.070 --> 05:46:28.080 align:start position:0%
passed with regard to tests
 
05:46:30.070 --> 05:46:30.080 align:start position:0%
and there were two places where it was
 
05:46:31.830 --> 05:46:31.840 align:start position:0%
taken and those were changed to pass
 
05:46:31.840 --> 05:46:32.788 align:start position:0%
taken and those were changed to pass
because

05:46:32.788 --> 05:46:32.798 align:start position:0%
because
 
05:46:36.470 --> 05:46:36.480 align:start position:0%
just taking a test doesn't necessarily
 
05:46:38.230 --> 05:46:38.240 align:start position:0%
mean much
 
05:46:40.230 --> 05:46:40.240 align:start position:0%
and the last was
 
05:46:42.150 --> 05:46:42.160 align:start position:0%
changing the effective date from 60 to
 
05:46:44.230 --> 05:46:44.240 align:start position:0%
90 days after passage
 
05:46:46.628 --> 05:46:46.638 align:start position:0%
which came up at the hearing and and uh
 
05:46:48.548 --> 05:46:48.558 align:start position:0%
oplc person uh
 
05:46:51.910 --> 05:46:51.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:53.830 --> 05:46:53.840 align:start position:0%
and that's it okay are there any
 
05:46:55.590 --> 05:46:55.600 align:start position:0%
questions or actually represent growth
 
05:46:58.070 --> 05:46:58.080 align:start position:0%
did you we should speak to your second
 
05:46:59.990 --> 05:47:00.000 align:start position:0%
i just want to say that that these
 
05:47:01.510 --> 05:47:01.520 align:start position:0%
changes were discussed during the
 
05:47:03.030 --> 05:47:03.040 align:start position:0%
hearing and it seemed that the committee
 
05:47:05.910 --> 05:47:05.920 align:start position:0%
was in favor of them
 
05:47:07.590 --> 05:47:07.600 align:start position:0%
all right thank you
 
05:47:09.830 --> 05:47:09.840 align:start position:0%
uh any questions represent fellows or
 
05:47:12.548 --> 05:47:12.558 align:start position:0%
comments um this is a question because i
 
05:47:14.390 --> 05:47:14.400 align:start position:0%
don't really understand
 
05:47:17.750 --> 05:47:17.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:23.030 --> 05:47:23.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:23.040 --> 05:47:23.910 align:start position:0%
 
uh

05:47:23.910 --> 05:47:23.920 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:47:26.788 --> 05:47:26.798 align:start position:0%
show up like if i could
 
05:47:29.350 --> 05:47:29.360 align:start position:0%
it seems to be representative lucas
 
05:47:31.350 --> 05:47:31.360 align:start position:0%
thinks he has an answer okay
 
05:47:31.360 --> 05:47:33.670 align:start position:0%
thinks he has an answer okay
um

05:47:33.670 --> 05:47:33.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:47:35.270 --> 05:47:35.280 align:start position:0%
there are
 
05:47:35.280 --> 05:47:36.470 align:start position:0%
there are
art

05:47:36.470 --> 05:47:36.480 align:start position:0%
art
 
05:47:37.910 --> 05:47:37.920 align:start position:0%
and maybe uh representative grota can
 
05:47:39.350 --> 05:47:39.360 align:start position:0%
help help as well but uh my
 
05:47:41.670 --> 05:47:41.680 align:start position:0%
understanding is that
 
05:47:46.470 --> 05:47:46.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:48.310 --> 05:47:48.320 align:start position:0%
unless the same equivalence data is
 
05:47:50.788 --> 05:47:50.798 align:start position:0%
currently always okay so it's it's
 
05:47:51.910 --> 05:47:51.920 align:start position:0%
saying they're applying for a new
 
05:47:53.270 --> 05:47:53.280 align:start position:0%
hampshire license
 
05:47:55.670 --> 05:47:55.680 align:start position:0%
a real estate license uh which is
 
05:47:58.628 --> 05:47:58.638 align:start position:0%
of a similar type as the one that they
 
05:48:00.548 --> 05:48:00.558 align:start position:0%
have in another jurisdiction type of
 
05:48:00.558 --> 05:48:01.750 align:start position:0%
have in another jurisdiction type of
status

05:48:01.750 --> 05:48:01.760 align:start position:0%
status
 
05:48:04.230 --> 05:48:04.240 align:start position:0%
the the point is that since it's a very
 
05:48:06.548 --> 05:48:06.558 align:start position:0%
small state there may be people who live
 
05:48:08.310 --> 05:48:08.320 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire who have been working
 
05:48:11.030 --> 05:48:11.040 align:start position:0%
in massachusetts or maine or vermont and
 
05:48:12.548 --> 05:48:12.558 align:start position:0%
now they want to get a new hampshire
 
05:48:16.230 --> 05:48:16.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:18.230 --> 05:48:18.240 align:start position:0%
that makes sense to me it just seems to
 
05:48:20.230 --> 05:48:20.240 align:start position:0%
be written backwards
 
05:48:21.670 --> 05:48:21.680 align:start position:0%
i would just think it would say
 
05:48:22.788 --> 05:48:22.798 align:start position:0%
something like
 
05:48:25.590 --> 05:48:25.600 align:start position:0%
if the applicant
 
05:48:27.830 --> 05:48:27.840 align:start position:0%
the applicant qualifies in new hampshire
 
05:48:29.030 --> 05:48:29.040 align:start position:0%
if he
 
05:48:29.040 --> 05:48:32.230 align:start position:0%
if he
holds

05:48:32.230 --> 05:48:32.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:34.390 --> 05:48:34.400 align:start position:0%
whatever yes it could it could
 
05:48:36.470 --> 05:48:36.480 align:start position:0%
frequently be better written
 
05:48:38.390 --> 05:48:38.400 align:start position:0%
but it does say
 
05:48:39.590 --> 05:48:39.600 align:start position:0%
when they're applying for a new
 
05:48:41.110 --> 05:48:41.120 align:start position:0%
hampshire license with the same
 
05:48:42.708 --> 05:48:42.718 align:start position:0%
equivalent status
 
05:48:44.708 --> 05:48:44.718 align:start position:0%
as currently licensed in the qualifying
 
05:48:46.310 --> 05:48:46.320 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction so the jurisdiction where
 
05:48:49.030 --> 05:48:49.040 align:start position:0%
they have existing yeah i guess i think
 
05:48:49.990 --> 05:48:50.000 align:start position:0%
i guess
 
05:48:51.910 --> 05:48:51.920 align:start position:0%
it's i would have said when they're
 
05:48:51.920 --> 05:48:55.830 align:start position:0%
it's i would have said when they're
applying

05:48:55.830 --> 05:48:55.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:57.510 --> 05:48:57.520 align:start position:0%
well yeah
 
05:48:59.590 --> 05:48:59.600 align:start position:0%
and their existing license is equivalent
 
05:49:01.910 --> 05:49:01.920 align:start position:0%
to the one they're applying for
 
05:49:03.190 --> 05:49:03.200 align:start position:0%
that's what it says
 
05:49:05.590 --> 05:49:05.600 align:start position:0%
that okay that's fine representative
 
05:49:05.600 --> 05:49:07.670 align:start position:0%
that okay that's fine representative
goalie

05:49:07.670 --> 05:49:07.680 align:start position:0%
goalie
 
05:49:09.830 --> 05:49:09.840 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair just one quick
 
05:49:12.788 --> 05:49:12.798 align:start position:0%
question because i'm looking at my notes
 
05:49:15.830 --> 05:49:15.840 align:start position:0%
and i have down
 
05:49:17.910 --> 05:49:17.920 align:start position:0%
that the recommended change was changing
 
05:49:21.030 --> 05:49:21.040 align:start position:0%
the word non-resident on line 27 to
 
05:49:23.510 --> 05:49:23.520 align:start position:0%
change it to recognition because that
 
05:49:25.830 --> 05:49:25.840 align:start position:0%
was what they called it and i just want
 
05:49:27.670 --> 05:49:27.680 align:start position:0%
to question the members of the
 
05:49:29.910 --> 05:49:29.920 align:start position:0%
subcommittee if that was
 
05:49:31.270 --> 05:49:31.280 align:start position:0%
deemed okay the way they wrote it
 
05:49:36.548 --> 05:49:36.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:38.788 --> 05:49:38.798 align:start position:0%
um yeah that was there was some further
 
05:49:41.270 --> 05:49:41.280 align:start position:0%
discussion i think either at or after
 
05:49:42.548 --> 05:49:42.558 align:start position:0%
the original hearing and the
 
05:49:44.548 --> 05:49:44.558 align:start position:0%
subcommittee and and some email that
 
05:49:44.558 --> 05:49:46.548 align:start position:0%
subcommittee and and some email that
went

05:49:46.548 --> 05:49:46.558 align:start position:0%
went
 
05:49:49.190 --> 05:49:49.200 align:start position:0%
that we exchanged and that um
 
05:49:51.830 --> 05:49:51.840 align:start position:0%
that taking the word out um
 
05:49:54.948 --> 05:49:54.958 align:start position:0%
fixed the problem and that's
 
05:49:59.190 --> 05:49:59.200 align:start position:0%
recognition was in in regard to
 
05:50:01.590 --> 05:50:01.600 align:start position:0%
a different portion
 
05:50:03.270 --> 05:50:03.280 align:start position:0%
well the section is recognition for
 
05:50:06.390 --> 05:50:06.400 align:start position:0%
licensure yeah and it it it just wasn't
 
05:50:08.628 --> 05:50:08.638 align:start position:0%
necessary and uh i mean could cause
 
05:50:11.990 --> 05:50:12.000 align:start position:0%
confusion was the conclusion thank you
 
05:50:14.948 --> 05:50:14.958 align:start position:0%
referring to line 27
 
05:50:16.548 --> 05:50:16.558 align:start position:0%
on the original bill and i believe it
 
05:50:18.548 --> 05:50:18.558 align:start position:0%
was representative fellowes
 
05:50:21.190 --> 05:50:21.200 align:start position:0%
who said i think during the hearing
 
05:50:22.948 --> 05:50:22.958 align:start position:0%
that you could just take that whole word
 
05:50:25.270 --> 05:50:25.280 align:start position:0%
out that it didn't wasn't needed but
 
05:50:26.708 --> 05:50:26.718 align:start position:0%
that's i recalled something like that
 
05:50:32.628 --> 05:50:32.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:35.270 --> 05:50:35.280 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
05:50:39.590 --> 05:50:39.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:41.830 --> 05:50:41.840 align:start position:0%
this is not to do with this but since
 
05:50:43.270 --> 05:50:43.280 align:start position:0%
this executive session has anybody
 
05:50:46.150 --> 05:50:46.160 align:start position:0%

05:57:27.510 --> 05:57:27.520 align:start position:0%
deadline is march 10th
 
05:57:29.430 --> 05:57:29.440 align:start position:0%
subcommittees are free to schedule
 
05:57:31.030 --> 05:57:31.040 align:start position:0%
whenever you like
 
05:57:33.190 --> 05:57:33.200 align:start position:0%
i would suggest starting
 
05:57:35.430 --> 05:57:35.440 align:start position:0%
sooner rather than later because it's
 
05:57:37.590 --> 05:57:37.600 align:start position:0%
quite possible we'll be getting some
 
05:57:39.270 --> 05:57:39.280 align:start position:0%
second committee bills
 
05:57:39.280 --> 05:57:40.310 align:start position:0%
second committee bills
and

05:57:40.310 --> 05:57:40.320 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:57:42.390 --> 05:57:42.400 align:start position:0%
bills from the senate in fact they just
 
05:57:45.270 --> 05:57:45.280 align:start position:0%
passed a whole slug of them yes on last
 
05:57:45.280 --> 05:57:46.310 align:start position:0%
passed a whole slug of them yes on last
week

05:57:46.310 --> 05:57:46.320 align:start position:0%
week
 
05:57:46.320 --> 05:57:48.310 align:start position:0%
week
so

05:57:48.310 --> 05:57:48.320 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:57:50.548 --> 05:57:50.558 align:start position:0%
plan your your workload
 
05:57:53.350 --> 05:57:53.360 align:start position:0%
uh i'm i'm only expecting to have one
 
05:57:55.430 --> 05:57:55.440 align:start position:0%
formal executive session toward the end
 
05:58:00.708 --> 05:58:00.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:02.070 --> 05:58:02.080 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
05:58:04.628 --> 05:58:04.638 align:start position:0%
yes ma'am sure do you have any kind of a
 
05:58:06.708 --> 05:58:06.718 align:start position:0%
feeling as to how many
 
05:58:08.470 --> 05:58:08.480 align:start position:0%
second committee house bills we are
 
05:58:09.830 --> 05:58:09.840 align:start position:0%
likely to get
 
05:58:11.430 --> 05:58:11.440 align:start position:0%
no and
 
05:58:13.590 --> 05:58:13.600 align:start position:0%
so that my recommendation if you see a
 
05:58:15.030 --> 05:58:15.040 align:start position:0%
licensing bill
 
05:58:16.868 --> 05:58:16.878 align:start position:0%
or coming from another committee you
 
05:58:20.150 --> 05:58:20.160 align:start position:0%
vote against it that way we won't get it
 
05:58:23.430 --> 05:58:23.440 align:start position:0%
and they have to pass that advice
 
05:58:25.030 --> 05:58:25.040 align:start position:0%
they have to pass the house to come to
 
05:58:27.030 --> 05:58:27.040 align:start position:0%
us we'll undoubtedly get some but i
 
06:01:23.910 --> 06:01:23.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:25.750 --> 06:01:25.760 align:start position:0%
being three o'clock i opened the public
 
06:01:27.270 --> 06:01:27.280 align:start position:0%
hearing on
 
06:01:29.190 --> 06:01:29.200 align:start position:0%
a non-jermaine amendment the house bill
 
06:01:29.200 --> 06:01:30.788 align:start position:0%
a non-jermaine amendment the house bill
1566

06:01:30.788 --> 06:01:30.798 align:start position:0%
1566
 
06:01:33.350 --> 06:01:33.360 align:start position:0%
representative lackas
 
06:01:35.270 --> 06:01:35.280 align:start position:0%
thank you i'm representative lucas
 
06:01:37.750 --> 06:01:37.760 align:start position:0%
hillsborough 37 representing the towns
 
06:01:40.070 --> 06:01:40.080 align:start position:0%
of hudson and pelham
 
06:01:44.628 --> 06:01:44.638 align:start position:0%
and i'm introducing amendment 0375h
 
06:01:49.030 --> 06:01:49.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:51.030 --> 06:01:51.040 align:start position:0%
what this amendment does is very simple
 
06:01:53.190 --> 06:01:53.200 align:start position:0%
it repeals
 
06:01:53.200 --> 06:01:54.270 align:start position:0%
it repeals
rsa

06:01:54.270 --> 06:01:54.280 align:start position:0%
rsa
 
06:01:57.910 --> 06:01:57.920 align:start position:0%
126-bb which in effect
 
06:02:00.470 --> 06:02:00.480 align:start position:0%
eliminates the prescription drug
 
06:02:04.628 --> 06:02:04.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:06.230 --> 06:02:06.240 align:start position:0%
bringing this member amendment forward
 
06:02:08.070 --> 06:02:08.080 align:start position:0%
for also this was heard before our
 
06:02:10.470 --> 06:02:10.480 align:start position:0%
subcommittee and
 
06:02:12.470 --> 06:02:12.480 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee voted to
 
06:02:16.470 --> 06:02:16.480 align:start position:0%
support the amendment three to two
 
06:02:19.430 --> 06:02:19.440 align:start position:0%
so a little bit of history on
 
06:02:21.670 --> 06:02:21.680 align:start position:0%
how the prescription drug advisory board
 
06:02:23.830 --> 06:02:23.840 align:start position:0%
came to be
 
06:02:27.030 --> 06:02:27.040 align:start position:0%
it was created by the 2022 2020 bill
 
06:02:29.670 --> 06:02:29.680 align:start position:0%
house bill 1280 and that bill came to
 
06:02:31.190 --> 06:02:31.200 align:start position:0%
the house as a straightforward bill
 
06:02:34.628 --> 06:02:34.638 align:start position:0%
dealing with co-payments for insulin
 
06:02:36.548 --> 06:02:36.558 align:start position:0%
however when it came back from the
 
06:02:38.470 --> 06:02:38.480 align:start position:0%
senate it had been turned into an
 
06:02:40.470 --> 06:02:40.480 align:start position:0%
omnibus bill including i think it was at
 
06:02:43.430 --> 06:02:43.440 align:start position:0%
least seven different topics
 
06:02:45.510 --> 06:02:45.520 align:start position:0%
and while the house uh just didn't
 
06:02:46.948 --> 06:02:46.958 align:start position:0%
concur i mean there was no committee of
 
06:02:48.230 --> 06:02:48.240 align:start position:0%
conference or anything just a straight
 
06:02:50.470 --> 06:02:50.480 align:start position:0%
concur with the senate version
 
06:02:52.708 --> 06:02:52.718 align:start position:0%
that year the bill had no public hearing
 
06:02:53.990 --> 06:02:54.000 align:start position:0%
in the house
 
06:02:55.590 --> 06:02:55.600 align:start position:0%
it was not considered by any house
 
06:02:58.150 --> 06:02:58.160 align:start position:0%
committee so the house did not have an
 
06:03:00.230 --> 06:03:00.240 align:start position:0%
opportunity to give this complicated
 
06:03:03.350 --> 06:03:03.360 align:start position:0%
bill uh proper consideration
 
06:03:07.190 --> 06:03:07.200 align:start position:0%
i think there's a number of issues
 
06:03:09.270 --> 06:03:09.280 align:start position:0%
with the board
 
06:03:11.590 --> 06:03:11.600 align:start position:0%
the board has the power to basically in
 
06:03:13.430 --> 06:03:13.440 align:start position:0%
effect engage in
 
06:03:15.910 --> 06:03:15.920 align:start position:0%
fixing prices for prescription drugs
 
06:03:17.990 --> 06:03:18.000 align:start position:0%
purchased by public payers
 
06:03:19.750 --> 06:03:19.760 align:start position:0%
i mean they don't set the price but if
 
06:03:21.270 --> 06:03:21.280 align:start position:0%
they're not satisfied with the price
 
06:03:22.390 --> 06:03:22.400 align:start position:0%
they get
 
06:03:24.868 --> 06:03:24.878 align:start position:0%
they can make such drugs unavailable uh
 
06:03:26.230 --> 06:03:26.240 align:start position:0%
through a public pair thereby
 
06:03:28.470 --> 06:03:28.480 align:start position:0%
prohibiting patients from receiving
 
06:03:30.548 --> 06:03:30.558 align:start position:0%
drugs that their doctors consider uh
 
06:03:32.310 --> 06:03:32.320 align:start position:0%
best for them or at least they won't get
 
06:03:35.110 --> 06:03:35.120 align:start position:0%
paid for
 
06:03:38.948 --> 06:03:38.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:40.470 --> 06:03:40.480 align:start position:0%
the board is charged with the pot it's
 
06:03:43.190 --> 06:03:43.200 align:start position:0%
given the power to
 
06:03:45.510 --> 06:03:45.520 align:start position:0%
create a database with a range of
 
06:03:47.350 --> 06:03:47.360 align:start position:0%
information on prescription drugs
 
06:03:50.548 --> 06:03:50.558 align:start position:0%
pricing and other things
 
06:03:52.628 --> 06:03:52.638 align:start position:0%
and it can require pairs providers
 
06:03:54.230 --> 06:03:54.240 align:start position:0%
prescription drug manufacturers
 
06:03:57.750 --> 06:03:57.760 align:start position:0%
wholesale drug distributors
 
06:03:59.910 --> 06:03:59.920 align:start position:0%
you know pharmacy benefit managers and
 
06:04:02.948 --> 06:04:02.958 align:start position:0%
others to provide that information
 
06:04:05.350 --> 06:04:05.360 align:start position:0%
and not only can the board require those
 
06:04:07.190 --> 06:04:07.200 align:start position:0%
entities to provide the data the board's
 
06:04:09.350 --> 06:04:09.360 align:start position:0%
then empowered to sell that data which i
 
06:04:11.990 --> 06:04:12.000 align:start position:0%
thought was kind of interesting
 
06:04:13.910 --> 06:04:13.920 align:start position:0%
the board also has the power to assess
 
06:04:16.868 --> 06:04:16.878 align:start position:0%
fees from many entities related to
 
06:04:18.788 --> 06:04:18.798 align:start position:0%
prescription drugs
 
06:04:20.788 --> 06:04:20.798 align:start position:0%
the information i got so there's
 
06:04:20.798 --> 06:04:22.310 align:start position:0%
the information i got so there's
approximately

06:04:22.310 --> 06:04:22.320 align:start position:0%
approximately
 
06:04:25.670 --> 06:04:25.680 align:start position:0%
1700 entities subject to a 500 fee and
 
06:04:27.910 --> 06:04:27.920 align:start position:0%
other entities or can be assessed a fee
 
06:04:30.628 --> 06:04:30.638 align:start position:0%
of not less than a hundred dollars
 
06:04:32.948 --> 06:04:32.958 align:start position:0%
the total effect of what these these are
 
06:04:34.628 --> 06:04:34.638 align:start position:0%
in effect taxes the board will collect
 
06:04:35.990 --> 06:04:36.000 align:start position:0%
is estimated
 
06:04:37.190 --> 06:04:37.200 align:start position:0%
i've seen between eight hundred and
 
06:04:39.350 --> 06:04:39.360 align:start position:0%
fifty thousand one point two million and
 
06:04:39.360 --> 06:04:40.310 align:start position:0%
fifty thousand one point two million and
i

06:04:40.310 --> 06:04:40.320 align:start position:0%
i
 
06:04:41.990 --> 06:04:42.000 align:start position:0%
some of reigns said it could reach up to
 
06:04:43.590 --> 06:04:43.600 align:start position:0%
two million
 
06:04:45.750 --> 06:04:45.760 align:start position:0%
and the bill would create a non-lapsing
 
06:04:47.750 --> 06:04:47.760 align:start position:0%
dedicated fund for this money the board
 
06:04:49.430 --> 06:04:49.440 align:start position:0%
raise and spend without
 
06:04:52.150 --> 06:04:52.160 align:start position:0%
oversight by you know legislature
 
06:04:53.990 --> 06:04:54.000 align:start position:0%
fiscal committee governor council or
 
06:04:56.390 --> 06:04:56.400 align:start position:0%
anybody else
 
06:04:57.830 --> 06:04:57.840 align:start position:0%
and the other one is the board is
 
06:04:59.670 --> 06:04:59.680 align:start position:0%
permitted to meet and deliberate
 
06:05:01.910 --> 06:05:01.920 align:start position:0%
maintenance in secret because the
 
06:05:03.190 --> 06:05:03.200 align:start position:0%
statute exempts them from the
 
06:05:06.230 --> 06:05:06.240 align:start position:0%
requirements of rsa 91a except that
 
06:05:08.470 --> 06:05:08.480 align:start position:0%
any decision of the board shall be made
 
06:05:10.548 --> 06:05:10.558 align:start position:0%
in you know made public once they made
 
06:05:13.670 --> 06:05:13.680 align:start position:0%
their decision but not the process
 
06:05:15.830 --> 06:05:15.840 align:start position:0%
and neither the board nor the advisory
 
06:05:18.948 --> 06:05:18.958 align:start position:0%
council which is an advisor advisory to
 
06:05:20.788 --> 06:05:20.798 align:start position:0%
the board are permitted to have any
 
06:05:22.628 --> 06:05:22.638 align:start position:0%
representatives from
 
06:05:24.948 --> 06:05:24.958 align:start position:0%
drug you know producers providers uh you
 
06:05:27.510 --> 06:05:27.520 align:start position:0%
know who could present represent their
 
06:05:30.708 --> 06:05:30.718 align:start position:0%
views um to the board
 
06:05:32.948 --> 06:05:32.958 align:start position:0%
and then there's you know
 
06:05:34.628 --> 06:05:34.638 align:start position:0%
it's a further question of is the board
 
06:05:36.708 --> 06:05:36.718 align:start position:0%
actually necessary
 
06:05:38.628 --> 06:05:38.638 align:start position:0%
and it turns out the departments of
 
06:05:40.310 --> 06:05:40.320 align:start position:0%
insurance and health and human services
 
06:05:41.830 --> 06:05:41.840 align:start position:0%
have been collecting
 
06:05:44.070 --> 06:05:44.080 align:start position:0%
very similar prescription drug data for
 
06:05:46.230 --> 06:05:46.240 align:start position:0%
over a decade
 
06:05:48.230 --> 06:05:48.240 align:start position:0%
and the department of administrative
 
06:05:50.150 --> 06:05:50.160 align:start position:0%
services is currently authorized to
 
06:05:53.030 --> 06:05:53.040 align:start position:0%
conduct a reverse auction process
 
06:05:54.868 --> 06:05:54.878 align:start position:0%
to achieve lower prescription drug
 
06:05:56.788 --> 06:05:56.798 align:start position:0%
prices for health insurance plans
 
06:05:58.390 --> 06:05:58.400 align:start position:0%
administered by the state
 
06:06:00.548 --> 06:06:00.558 align:start position:0%
and das has already successfully done so
 
06:06:04.868 --> 06:06:04.878 align:start position:0%
i actually got a call back from
 
06:06:04.878 --> 06:06:06.788 align:start position:0%
i actually got a call back from
the

06:06:06.788 --> 06:06:06.798 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:06:09.270 --> 06:06:09.280 align:start position:0%
director commissioner um arlene house
 
06:06:11.030 --> 06:06:11.040 align:start position:0%
charlie arlinghaus
 
06:06:12.628 --> 06:06:12.638 align:start position:0%
about what they've been doing in this
 
06:06:15.270 --> 06:06:15.280 align:start position:0%
area and they've been very active
 
06:06:17.270 --> 06:06:17.280 align:start position:0%
in working to keep prescription drug
 
06:06:19.030 --> 06:06:19.040 align:start position:0%
prices down they're monitoring what's
 
06:06:21.350 --> 06:06:21.360 align:start position:0%
going on out of their states
 
06:06:22.868 --> 06:06:22.878 align:start position:0%
even in cases where they're not doing
 
06:06:24.390 --> 06:06:24.400 align:start position:0%
reverse auctions
 
06:06:25.350 --> 06:06:25.360 align:start position:0%
they are
 
06:06:27.430 --> 06:06:27.440 align:start position:0%
putting these out to bid and they have
 
06:06:29.670 --> 06:06:29.680 align:start position:0%
gotten certainly lower prices as a
 
06:06:29.680 --> 06:06:31.030 align:start position:0%
gotten certainly lower prices as a
result

result
 
06:06:31.040 --> 06:06:32.548 align:start position:0%
result
and

06:06:32.548 --> 06:06:32.558 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:06:34.390 --> 06:06:34.400 align:start position:0%
you know they're doing a variety of
 
06:06:34.400 --> 06:06:35.510 align:start position:0%
you know they're doing a variety of
things

06:06:35.510 --> 06:06:35.520 align:start position:0%
things
 
06:06:35.520 --> 06:06:36.548 align:start position:0%
things
around

06:06:36.548 --> 06:06:36.558 align:start position:0%
around
 
06:06:38.390 --> 06:06:38.400 align:start position:0%
purchasing and bidding
 
06:06:38.400 --> 06:06:39.270 align:start position:0%
purchasing and bidding
to

06:06:39.270 --> 06:06:39.280 align:start position:0%
to
 
06:06:41.430 --> 06:06:41.440 align:start position:0%
you know reduce the cost to the state of
 
06:06:43.110 --> 06:06:43.120 align:start position:0%
the prescription drugs for these
 
06:06:45.030 --> 06:06:45.040 align:start position:0%
programs so
 
06:06:45.040 --> 06:06:46.390 align:start position:0%
programs so
um

06:06:46.390 --> 06:06:46.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:06:47.990 --> 06:06:48.000 align:start position:0%
i see problems with how the board was
 
06:06:48.000 --> 06:06:49.030 align:start position:0%
i see problems with how the board was
created

06:06:49.030 --> 06:06:49.040 align:start position:0%
created
 
06:06:51.190 --> 06:06:51.200 align:start position:0%
the powers the board has and i don't
 
06:06:53.510 --> 06:06:53.520 align:start position:0%
believe it's actually necessary which is
 
06:06:55.830 --> 06:06:55.840 align:start position:0%
why i'm proposing to abolish the board
 
06:06:57.670 --> 06:06:57.680 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:06:58.948 --> 06:06:58.958 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any questions for
 
06:07:00.788 --> 06:07:00.798 align:start position:0%
representative bleckis
 
06:07:02.708 --> 06:07:02.718 align:start position:0%
representative marsh
 
06:07:04.150 --> 06:07:04.160 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you
 
06:07:05.670 --> 06:07:05.680 align:start position:0%
representative lancaster for taking my
 
06:07:08.230 --> 06:07:08.240 align:start position:0%
question uh as you and i both know this
 
06:07:10.470 --> 06:07:10.480 align:start position:0%
language originally began in senate bill
 
06:07:13.590 --> 06:07:13.600 align:start position:0%
687 and as we also know governor sununu
 
06:07:16.310 --> 06:07:16.320 align:start position:0%
issued a press release on march 11 2020
 
06:07:18.150 --> 06:07:18.160 align:start position:0%
in which he stated this bill will create
 
06:07:19.750 --> 06:07:19.760 align:start position:0%
a drug affordability board in new
 
06:07:22.150 --> 06:07:22.160 align:start position:0%
hampshire to monitor changes in the cost
 
06:07:23.670 --> 06:07:23.680 align:start position:0%
of prescription drugs to keep the
 
06:07:25.910 --> 06:07:25.920 align:start position:0%
industry honest and to keep an eye on
 
06:07:28.548 --> 06:07:28.558 align:start position:0%
prices to prevent price spikes often
 
06:07:30.150 --> 06:07:30.160 align:start position:0%
many of the challenges in health care
 
06:07:31.350 --> 06:07:31.360 align:start position:0%
can start to be addressed through
 
06:07:33.750 --> 06:07:33.760 align:start position:0%
greater transparency and pricing that
 
06:07:35.350 --> 06:07:35.360 align:start position:0%
transparency brings scrutiny and
 
06:07:37.190 --> 06:07:37.200 align:start position:0%
accountability as to why the cost of a
 
06:07:39.670 --> 06:07:39.680 align:start position:0%
particular drug is high or higher than
 
06:07:41.350 --> 06:07:41.360 align:start position:0%
similar drugs i look forward to signing
 
06:07:43.110 --> 06:07:43.120 align:start position:0%
the spill into law
 
06:07:44.708 --> 06:07:44.718 align:start position:0%
given that that was the statement
 
06:07:46.708 --> 06:07:46.718 align:start position:0%
governor sununu made about this language
 
06:07:48.548 --> 06:07:48.558 align:start position:0%
i'm wondering what governor sununu's
 
06:07:50.548 --> 06:07:50.558 align:start position:0%
opinion of your amendment is you would
 
06:07:52.230 --> 06:07:52.240 align:start position:0%
have to ask the governor i cannot speak
 
06:07:54.470 --> 06:07:54.480 align:start position:0%
for him
 
06:07:57.670 --> 06:07:57.680 align:start position:0%
thank you any other questions
 
06:07:57.680 --> 06:07:58.830 align:start position:0%
thank you any other questions
representative

06:07:58.830 --> 06:07:58.840 align:start position:0%
representative
 
06:08:02.070 --> 06:08:02.080 align:start position:0%
horrigan um yes thank you very much mr
 
06:08:03.110 --> 06:08:03.120 align:start position:0%
chair thank you mr representative
 
06:08:04.548 --> 06:08:04.558 align:start position:0%
blackist i was
 
06:08:06.548 --> 06:08:06.558 align:start position:0%
peeking at the docket for the bill so
 
06:08:09.350 --> 06:08:09.360 align:start position:0%
the senate uh passed it and sent it um
 
06:08:11.750 --> 06:08:11.760 align:start position:0%
over the wall which in that case was 35
 
06:08:13.510 --> 06:08:13.520 align:start position:0%
miles wide because they're meeting here
 
06:08:16.150 --> 06:08:16.160 align:start position:0%
perhaps all we're beating
 
06:08:18.470 --> 06:08:18.480 align:start position:0%
yes so what
 
06:08:19.430 --> 06:08:19.440 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
06:08:21.430 --> 06:08:21.440 align:start position:0%
and then when we next time we met we
 
06:08:23.030 --> 06:08:23.040 align:start position:0%
approved the conference uh committee
 
06:08:24.470 --> 06:08:24.480 align:start position:0%
report so what
 
06:08:26.150 --> 06:08:26.160 align:start position:0%
what should we have done differently
 
06:08:27.510 --> 06:08:27.520 align:start position:0%
back then and the conference committee
 
06:08:29.030 --> 06:08:29.040 align:start position:0%
court you know passed with a very broad
 
06:08:32.150 --> 06:08:32.160 align:start position:0%
bipartisan margin but um so
 
06:08:34.070 --> 06:08:34.080 align:start position:0%
what should we do morgan one thing we
 
06:08:36.548 --> 06:08:36.558 align:start position:0%
should have done was reject this bill
 
06:08:38.948 --> 06:08:38.958 align:start position:0%
because our rules forbid us from
 
06:08:42.150 --> 06:08:42.160 align:start position:0%
accepting from the other body
 
06:08:44.070 --> 06:08:44.080 align:start position:0%
as part of the committee of conference
 
06:08:46.788 --> 06:08:46.798 align:start position:0%
procedure a new fee that has not had a
 
06:08:49.510 --> 06:08:49.520 align:start position:0%
hearing in the house and these fees
 
06:08:57.510 --> 06:08:57.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:01.590 --> 06:09:01.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:03.590 --> 06:09:03.600 align:start position:0%
thank you representative lackas
 
06:09:21.830 --> 06:09:21.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:23.670 --> 06:09:23.680 align:start position:0%
here we go
 
06:09:25.190 --> 06:09:25.200 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair for the record my
 
06:09:26.868 --> 06:09:26.878 align:start position:0%
name is peter leishman i represent
 
06:09:30.310 --> 06:09:30.320 align:start position:0%
hillsboro 24 which is peterborough
 
06:09:32.868 --> 06:09:32.878 align:start position:0%
so i can't really add much more than the
 
06:09:35.510 --> 06:09:35.520 align:start position:0%
sponsors of the amendment from hudson
 
06:09:37.110 --> 06:09:37.120 align:start position:0%
just spoke to but
 
06:09:38.948 --> 06:09:38.958 align:start position:0%
as the chair knows i'm very much a
 
06:09:41.830 --> 06:09:41.840 align:start position:0%
process person and when the request came
 
06:09:43.590 --> 06:09:43.600 align:start position:0%
to the fiscal committee
 
06:09:43.600 --> 06:09:44.548 align:start position:0%
to the fiscal committee
several

06:09:44.548 --> 06:09:44.558 align:start position:0%
several
 
06:09:47.750 --> 06:09:47.760 align:start position:0%
weeks back for the authorization
 
06:09:50.150 --> 06:09:50.160 align:start position:0%
to have some funding for an executive
 
06:09:52.628 --> 06:09:52.638 align:start position:0%
director and so forth i did a little
 
06:09:54.310 --> 06:09:54.320 align:start position:0%
digging because i really hadn't paid
 
06:09:56.948 --> 06:09:56.958 align:start position:0%
much attention to this particular
 
06:09:59.430 --> 06:09:59.440 align:start position:0%
board until it came to if you will my
 
06:09:59.440 --> 06:10:00.868 align:start position:0%
board until it came to if you will my
headlights

06:10:00.868 --> 06:10:00.878 align:start position:0%
headlights
 
06:10:00.878 --> 06:10:01.670 align:start position:0%
headlights
and

06:10:01.670 --> 06:10:01.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:10:03.590 --> 06:10:03.600 align:start position:0%
when i learned that never had the proper
 
06:10:05.350 --> 06:10:05.360 align:start position:0%
hearing in the house that fees were
 
06:10:05.360 --> 06:10:06.470 align:start position:0%
hearing in the house that fees were
established

06:10:06.470 --> 06:10:06.480 align:start position:0%
established
 
06:10:09.190 --> 06:10:09.200 align:start position:0%
without a thorough house review i
 
06:10:12.150 --> 06:10:12.160 align:start position:0%
learned of the representatives amendment
 
06:10:14.310 --> 06:10:14.320 align:start position:0%
just a day or two ago and i thought i
 
06:10:16.070 --> 06:10:16.080 align:start position:0%
should come and at least support that
 
06:10:18.470 --> 06:10:18.480 align:start position:0%
amendment because this is totally
 
06:10:21.110 --> 06:10:21.120 align:start position:0%
contrary to the feelings i've always had
 
06:10:22.150 --> 06:10:22.160 align:start position:0%
as far as
 
06:10:24.788 --> 06:10:24.798 align:start position:0%
a real public review of any legislation
 
06:10:27.030 --> 06:10:27.040 align:start position:0%
whether it be fees or a new board so
 
06:10:28.310 --> 06:10:28.320 align:start position:0%
that's why i'm here to support the
 
06:10:28.320 --> 06:10:29.430 align:start position:0%
that's why i'm here to support the
amendment

06:10:29.430 --> 06:10:29.440 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
06:10:30.948 --> 06:10:30.958 align:start position:0%

um

06:10:58.868 --> 06:10:58.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:00.628 --> 06:11:00.638 align:start position:0%
i wanted to
 
06:11:02.548 --> 06:11:02.558 align:start position:0%
talk just a little bit
 
06:11:04.310 --> 06:11:04.320 align:start position:0%
about the prescription drug
 
06:11:06.470 --> 06:11:06.480 align:start position:0%
affordability board i was prime sponsor
 
06:11:08.628 --> 06:11:08.638 align:start position:0%
of the bill that introduced it
 
06:11:11.670 --> 06:11:11.680 align:start position:0%
i was approached by aarp and new futures
 
06:11:13.110 --> 06:11:13.120 align:start position:0%
and others
 
06:11:14.948 --> 06:11:14.958 align:start position:0%
to see if we could do this in the state
 
06:11:17.270 --> 06:11:17.280 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire
 
06:11:19.910 --> 06:11:19.920 align:start position:0%
this is something that's not new it's
 
06:11:24.070 --> 06:11:24.080 align:start position:0%
already enacted in maine and maryland
 
06:11:28.948 --> 06:11:28.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:31.830 --> 06:11:31.840 align:start position:0%
the point of the bill was part of
 
06:11:35.110 --> 06:11:35.120 align:start position:0%
actually three bills at the time that
 
06:11:37.030 --> 06:11:37.040 align:start position:0%
one would have been the reverse auction
 
06:11:38.948 --> 06:11:38.958 align:start position:0%
bill that the sponsor of the amendment
 
06:11:40.948 --> 06:11:40.958 align:start position:0%
mentioned so that was also part of that
 
06:11:42.548 --> 06:11:42.558 align:start position:0%
omnibus bill
 
06:11:45.708 --> 06:11:45.718 align:start position:0%
as was the bill that allowed us to do
 
06:11:48.548 --> 06:11:48.558 align:start position:0%
reimportation of pharmaceuticals from
 
06:11:48.558 --> 06:11:50.708 align:start position:0%
reimportation of pharmaceuticals from
canada

06:11:50.708 --> 06:11:50.718 align:start position:0%
canada
 
06:11:52.948 --> 06:11:52.958 align:start position:0%
the reason behind these bills is that
 
06:11:55.110 --> 06:11:55.120 align:start position:0%
one of the biggest costs
 
06:11:57.830 --> 06:11:57.840 align:start position:0%
to patients i'm a physician
 
06:12:01.270 --> 06:12:01.280 align:start position:0%
so to patients and to the state has has
 
06:12:04.708 --> 06:12:04.718 align:start position:0%
to do with prescription drugs
 
06:12:07.670 --> 06:12:07.680 align:start position:0%
so what the p dab or prescription drug
 
06:12:09.910 --> 06:12:09.920 align:start position:0%
affordability by the way it is the word
 
06:12:13.110 --> 06:12:13.120 align:start position:0%
is affordability board
 
06:12:15.030 --> 06:12:15.040 align:start position:0%
the goal there is to
 
06:12:16.390 --> 06:12:16.400 align:start position:0%
make the state
 
06:12:19.830 --> 06:12:19.840 align:start position:0%
as smart a consumer as possible
 
06:12:21.670 --> 06:12:21.680 align:start position:0%
it doesn't
 
06:12:24.948 --> 06:12:24.958 align:start position:0%
regulate which medicines are available
 
06:12:27.350 --> 06:12:27.360 align:start position:0%
but it looks at
 
06:12:29.990 --> 06:12:30.000 align:start position:0%
and if you look at the in the rsa if you
 
06:12:31.270 --> 06:12:31.280 align:start position:0%
look at the
 
06:12:34.310 --> 06:12:34.320 align:start position:0%
powers and duties of the board
 
06:12:35.910 --> 06:12:35.920 align:start position:0%
first of all and i think this is very
 
06:12:37.910 --> 06:12:37.920 align:start position:0%
important the board shall identify
 
06:12:40.310 --> 06:12:40.320 align:start position:0%
strategies that optimize spending by
 
06:12:42.628 --> 06:12:42.638 align:start position:0%
public payers that's us
 
06:12:44.548 --> 06:12:44.558 align:start position:0%
for pharmaceutical products while
 
06:12:47.750 --> 06:12:47.760 align:start position:0%
reasonably ensuring subscriber access
 
06:12:49.190 --> 06:12:49.200 align:start position:0%
that's to make sure the drugs are
 
06:12:51.110 --> 06:12:51.120 align:start position:0%
available to people who need them
 
06:12:53.670 --> 06:12:53.680 align:start position:0%
to needed pharmaceutical prod
 
06:12:53.680 --> 06:12:55.190 align:start position:0%
to needed pharmaceutical prod
products

06:12:55.190 --> 06:12:55.200 align:start position:0%
products
 
06:12:57.190 --> 06:12:57.200 align:start position:0%
the second point is that the board shall
 
06:13:00.708 --> 06:13:00.718 align:start position:0%
determine spending targets on specific
 
06:13:02.948 --> 06:13:02.958 align:start position:0%
specific prescription drugs that may
 
06:13:05.510 --> 06:13:05.520 align:start position:0%
cause affordability challenges to enroll
 
06:13:09.510 --> 06:13:09.520 align:start position:0%
enrollees in a public payer health plan
 
06:13:11.750 --> 06:13:11.760 align:start position:0%
the board shall determine which public
 
06:13:14.230 --> 06:13:14.240 align:start position:0%
payers are likely to exceed the spending
 
06:13:17.110 --> 06:13:17.120 align:start position:0%
targets determined on the paragraph
 
06:13:20.868 --> 06:13:20.878 align:start position:0%
and then they make recommendations
 
06:13:24.788 --> 06:13:24.798 align:start position:0%
none of this tries to control pricing
 
06:13:26.868 --> 06:13:26.878 align:start position:0%
that is just not true
 
06:13:28.230 --> 06:13:28.240 align:start position:0%
we can't
 
06:13:29.830 --> 06:13:29.840 align:start position:0%
that's interstate commerce and it's
 
06:13:33.910 --> 06:13:33.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:36.070 --> 06:13:36.080 align:start position:0%
so what do we do well first of all the
 
06:13:37.510 --> 06:13:37.520 align:start position:0%
bill passed
 
06:13:39.190 --> 06:13:39.200 align:start position:0%
in the senate
 
06:13:39.200 --> 06:13:39.990 align:start position:0%
in the senate
by

06:13:39.990 --> 06:13:40.000 align:start position:0%
by
 
06:13:43.350 --> 06:13:43.360 align:start position:0%
virtually a unanimous bipartisan vote
 
06:13:46.230 --> 06:13:46.240 align:start position:0%
the members of the board include senator
 
06:13:46.240 --> 06:13:47.990 align:start position:0%
the members of the board include senator
carson

06:13:47.990 --> 06:13:48.000 align:start position:0%
carson
 
06:13:49.590 --> 06:13:49.600 align:start position:0%
several physicians
 
06:13:51.990 --> 06:13:52.000 align:start position:0%
governor appointees
 
06:13:57.990 --> 06:13:58.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:14:01.270 --> 06:14:01.280 align:start position:0%
the bill that was brought to you 1566
 
06:14:03.750 --> 06:14:03.760 align:start position:0%
was really to address some housekeeping
 
06:14:05.910 --> 06:14:05.920 align:start position:0%
items that have come
 
06:14:08.628 --> 06:14:08.638 align:start position:0%
up as ones that we need to really look
 
06:14:10.868 --> 06:14:10.878 align:start position:0%
at in terms of attracting
 
06:14:13.110 --> 06:14:13.120 align:start position:0%
leadership or
 
06:14:16.948 --> 06:14:16.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:14:19.590 --> 06:14:19.600 align:start position:0%
the goal of the board is to optimize the
 
06:14:21.590 --> 06:14:21.600 align:start position:0%
cost to the state by understanding the
 
06:14:23.910 --> 06:14:23.920 align:start position:0%
prescription drug environment our
 
06:14:26.390 --> 06:14:26.400 align:start position:0%
utilization as a public payer
 
06:14:29.910 --> 06:14:29.920 align:start position:0%
and how to decrease state costs
 
06:14:32.548 --> 06:14:32.558 align:start position:0%
there's nothing surreptitious about this
 
06:14:35.510 --> 06:14:35.520 align:start position:0%
and literally the board has spent
 
06:14:37.830 --> 06:14:37.840 align:start position:0%
20 30 hours
 
06:14:40.470 --> 06:14:40.480 align:start position:0%
in meeting time to try to get started or
 
06:14:40.480 --> 06:14:42.070 align:start position:0%
in meeting time to try to get started or
more

06:14:42.070 --> 06:14:42.080 align:start position:0%
more
 
06:14:44.390 --> 06:14:44.400 align:start position:0%
and one of the other points that was
 
06:14:46.868 --> 06:14:46.878 align:start position:0%
made was that all this or a lot of this
 
06:14:50.070 --> 06:14:50.080 align:start position:0%
is being done in secret that is not true
 
06:14:51.830 --> 06:14:51.840 align:start position:0%
the only portions of this that can be
 
06:14:53.910 --> 06:14:53.920 align:start position:0%
done in secret are actually to protect
 
06:14:56.470 --> 06:14:56.480 align:start position:0%
the pharmaceuticals because some of the
 
06:14:58.470 --> 06:14:58.480 align:start position:0%
information that they're providing is
 
06:15:01.350 --> 06:15:01.360 align:start position:0%
proprietary so we have developed a way
 
06:15:03.270 --> 06:15:03.280 align:start position:0%
that they can send us the proprietary
 
06:15:03.280 --> 06:15:04.548 align:start position:0%
that they can send us the proprietary
information

06:15:04.548 --> 06:15:04.558 align:start position:0%
information
 
06:15:06.948 --> 06:15:06.958 align:start position:0%
and then that we can meet
 
06:15:08.788 --> 06:15:08.798 align:start position:0%
uh without
 
06:15:11.270 --> 06:15:11.280 align:start position:0%
any public disclosure because
 
06:15:14.070 --> 06:15:14.080 align:start position:0%
to do so would actually be to give away
 
06:15:16.310 --> 06:15:16.320 align:start position:0%
their trade secrets which we're very
 
06:15:17.990 --> 06:15:18.000 align:start position:0%
protective of and that's the way the
 
06:15:20.708 --> 06:15:20.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:23.190 --> 06:15:23.200 align:start position:0%
so i think part of the drive of this and
 
06:15:24.470 --> 06:15:24.480 align:start position:0%
i understand
 
06:15:26.788 --> 06:15:26.798 align:start position:0%
representative leishman's concerns about
 
06:15:28.948 --> 06:15:28.958 align:start position:0%
due process or the process that was done
 
06:15:31.510 --> 06:15:31.520 align:start position:0%
and yours as well madam chair
 
06:15:33.030 --> 06:15:33.040 align:start position:0%
but i would ask you
 
06:15:35.670 --> 06:15:35.680 align:start position:0%
to look at the merits of what
 
06:15:37.350 --> 06:15:37.360 align:start position:0%
the prescription drug affordability
 
06:15:39.430 --> 06:15:39.440 align:start position:0%
board is trying to do which is decreased
 
06:15:41.670 --> 06:15:41.680 align:start position:0%
state costs
 
06:15:44.948 --> 06:15:44.958 align:start position:0%
we don't have any impact on pricing
 
06:15:47.830 --> 06:15:47.840 align:start position:0%
we don't have any impact on
 
06:15:47.840 --> 06:15:49.510 align:start position:0%
we don't have any impact on
how

06:15:49.510 --> 06:15:49.520 align:start position:0%
how
 
06:15:51.990 --> 06:15:52.000 align:start position:0%
a drug is marketed we don't have any
 
06:15:54.310 --> 06:15:54.320 align:start position:0%
impact on whether or not they can market
 
06:15:56.948 --> 06:15:56.958 align:start position:0%
it whether they can give rebates any of
 
06:15:56.958 --> 06:15:58.310 align:start position:0%
it whether they can give rebates any of
those

06:15:58.310 --> 06:15:58.320 align:start position:0%
those
 
06:16:00.310 --> 06:16:00.320 align:start position:0%
what we do have the ability to do as a
 
06:16:02.548 --> 06:16:02.558 align:start position:0%
board is to understand all of that
 
06:16:04.788 --> 06:16:04.798 align:start position:0%
environment the best as we can so that
 
06:16:06.470 --> 06:16:06.480 align:start position:0%
the state has the lowest prescription
 
06:16:09.510 --> 06:16:09.520 align:start position:0%
drug pricing and costs
 
06:16:11.110 --> 06:16:11.120 align:start position:0%
as possible
 
06:16:13.190 --> 06:16:13.200 align:start position:0%
while still having that availability and
 
06:16:13.200 --> 06:16:15.190 align:start position:0%
while still having that availability and
accessibility

06:16:15.190 --> 06:16:15.200 align:start position:0%
accessibility
 
06:16:16.788 --> 06:16:16.798 align:start position:0%
so i hope
 
06:16:18.788 --> 06:16:18.798 align:start position:0%
understanding that there were process
 
06:16:21.270 --> 06:16:21.280 align:start position:0%
issues because of the pandemic that we
 
06:16:21.280 --> 06:16:22.548 align:start position:0%
issues because of the pandemic that we
can

06:16:22.548 --> 06:16:22.558 align:start position:0%
can
 
06:16:24.708 --> 06:16:24.718 align:start position:0%
find a way to move forward with the
 
06:16:26.948 --> 06:16:26.958 align:start position:0%
amendment with the original bill and the
 
06:16:28.628 --> 06:16:28.638 align:start position:0%
housekeeping items that were in that
 
06:16:28.638 --> 06:16:30.070 align:start position:0%
housekeeping items that were in that
bill

06:16:30.070 --> 06:16:30.080 align:start position:0%
bill
 
06:16:32.070 --> 06:16:32.080 align:start position:0%
and again not
 
06:16:34.070 --> 06:16:34.080 align:start position:0%
destroy all the work that's been done to
 
06:16:34.080 --> 06:16:35.270 align:start position:0%
destroy all the work that's been done to
date

06:16:35.270 --> 06:16:35.280 align:start position:0%
date
 
06:16:37.830 --> 06:16:37.840 align:start position:0%
and also make sure that we can go ahead
 
06:16:40.230 --> 06:16:40.240 align:start position:0%
as the state as the state which is one
 
06:16:42.470 --> 06:16:42.480 align:start position:0%
of the largest consumers if not the
 
06:16:44.470 --> 06:16:44.480 align:start position:0%
largest consumer of prescription drugs
 
06:16:46.628 --> 06:16:46.638 align:start position:0%
in the in the state of new hampshire
 
06:16:49.110 --> 06:16:49.120 align:start position:0%
that we can be as smart as possible in
 
06:16:52.470 --> 06:16:52.480 align:start position:0%
this very complex environment
 
06:16:55.750 --> 06:16:55.760 align:start position:0%
so with that i'll take any questions
 
06:16:59.910 --> 06:16:59.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:17:01.510 --> 06:17:01.520 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:17:03.350 --> 06:17:03.360 align:start position:0%
senator sherman
 
06:17:05.350 --> 06:17:05.360 align:start position:0%
it was indicated
 
06:17:08.230 --> 06:17:08.240 align:start position:0%
in previous testimony that
 
06:17:09.510 --> 06:17:09.520 align:start position:0%
the department of health and human
 
06:17:11.670 --> 06:17:11.680 align:start position:0%
services is already collecting similar
 
06:17:11.680 --> 06:17:13.670 align:start position:0%
services is already collecting similar
data

06:17:13.670 --> 06:17:13.680 align:start position:0%
data
 
06:17:15.910 --> 06:17:15.920 align:start position:0%
can you comment on how that
 
06:17:18.070 --> 06:17:18.080 align:start position:0%
data collection would differ from what
 
06:17:20.548 --> 06:17:20.558 align:start position:0%
your the board is doing
 
06:17:23.990 --> 06:17:24.000 align:start position:0%
right what um hhs collects data on
 
06:17:26.788 --> 06:17:26.798 align:start position:0%
medicaid patients um and prescription
 
06:17:30.310 --> 06:17:30.320 align:start position:0%
drug utilization by medicaid patients
 
06:17:32.548 --> 06:17:32.558 align:start position:0%
um that's not what this board is
 
06:17:34.390 --> 06:17:34.400 align:start position:0%
designed to look at
 
06:17:38.150 --> 06:17:38.160 align:start position:0%
what this board is trying to look at is
 
06:17:40.868 --> 06:17:40.878 align:start position:0%
other systems that
 
06:17:43.750 --> 06:17:43.760 align:start position:0%
are utilizing this such as
 
06:17:43.760 --> 06:17:46.830 align:start position:0%
are utilizing this such as
state

06:17:46.830 --> 06:17:46.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:17:51.270 --> 06:17:51.280 align:start position:0%
um state employees and others that are
 
06:17:53.350 --> 06:17:53.360 align:start position:0%
funded through the state or through
 
06:18:02.708 --> 06:18:02.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:18:06.070 --> 06:18:06.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:18:06.080 --> 06:18:07.110 align:start position:0%
 
so

06:18:07.110 --> 06:18:07.120 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:18:07.120 --> 06:18:08.628 align:start position:0%
so
uh

06:18:08.628 --> 06:18:08.638 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:18:09.830 --> 06:18:09.840 align:start position:0%
you were
 
06:18:11.590 --> 06:18:11.600 align:start position:0%
listing i'm sure intently when
 
06:18:14.070 --> 06:18:14.080 align:start position:0%
representative marsh uh read the
 
06:18:15.830 --> 06:18:15.840 align:start position:0%
governor's statement
 
06:18:20.708 --> 06:18:20.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:18:20.718 --> 06:18:22.070 align:start position:0%
 
and

06:18:22.070 --> 06:18:22.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:18:22.080 --> 06:18:24.990 align:start position:0%
and
so

06:18:24.990 --> 06:18:25.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:18:25.000 --> 06:18:26.708 align:start position:0%
 
representationman's

06:18:26.708 --> 06:18:26.718 align:start position:0%
representationman's
 
06:18:28.788 --> 06:18:28.798 align:start position:0%
privacy concerns or
 
06:18:31.350 --> 06:18:31.360 align:start position:0%
process concerns are obviously things
 
06:18:33.590 --> 06:18:33.600 align:start position:0%
that we as house members have some
 
06:18:35.270 --> 06:18:35.280 align:start position:0%
responsibility to
 
06:18:36.390 --> 06:18:36.400 align:start position:0%
adhere to
 
06:18:36.400 --> 06:18:37.510 align:start position:0%
adhere to
but

06:18:37.510 --> 06:18:37.520 align:start position:0%
but
 
06:18:39.510 --> 06:18:39.520 align:start position:0%
the governor has a say in
 
06:18:40.868 --> 06:18:40.878 align:start position:0%
this in
 
06:18:40.878 --> 06:18:42.230 align:start position:0%
this in
this

06:18:42.230 --> 06:18:42.240 align:start position:0%
this
 
06:18:45.430 --> 06:18:45.440 align:start position:0%
process as well do we know whether the
 
06:18:48.390 --> 06:18:48.400 align:start position:0%
governor has taken a position on this
 
06:18:48.400 --> 06:18:50.310 align:start position:0%
governor has taken a position on this
amendment

06:18:50.310 --> 06:18:50.320 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
06:18:50.320 --> 06:18:51.430 align:start position:0%
amendment
i

06:18:51.430 --> 06:18:51.440 align:start position:0%
i
 
06:18:53.270 --> 06:18:53.280 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question by the way i
 
06:18:56.390 --> 06:18:56.400 align:start position:0%
also was a house member so i i get it i
 
06:18:59.830 --> 06:18:59.840 align:start position:0%
was in the house from 2012 to 2016.
 
06:18:59.840 --> 06:19:00.708 align:start position:0%
was in the house from 2012 to 2016.
um

06:19:00.708 --> 06:19:00.718 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:19:00.718 --> 06:19:01.670 align:start position:0%
um
and

06:19:01.670 --> 06:19:01.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:19:03.750 --> 06:19:03.760 align:start position:0%
and i when i was a house member i was
 
06:19:05.750 --> 06:19:05.760 align:start position:0%
also fiercely
 
06:19:07.750 --> 06:19:07.760 align:start position:0%
defending the rights of the house but i
 
06:19:09.910 --> 06:19:09.920 align:start position:0%
will remind the house members
 
06:19:11.750 --> 06:19:11.760 align:start position:0%
that this was something that could have
 
06:19:13.510 --> 06:19:13.520 align:start position:0%
been concurred with or not concurred
 
06:19:15.190 --> 06:19:15.200 align:start position:0%
with and
 
06:19:19.110 --> 06:19:19.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:19:20.948 --> 06:19:20.958 align:start position:0%
if there was a problem with that i'd
 
06:19:22.468 --> 06:19:22.478 align:start position:0%
much rather address
 
06:19:24.548 --> 06:19:24.558 align:start position:0%
go back look at the issues that might
 
06:19:26.548 --> 06:19:26.558 align:start position:0%
have been raised rather than
 
06:19:28.150 --> 06:19:28.160 align:start position:0%
really throwing out
 
06:19:32.788 --> 06:19:32.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:19:35.030 --> 06:19:35.040 align:start position:0%
to answer your question the governor
 
06:19:36.948 --> 06:19:36.958 align:start position:0%
signed in in support of the original
 
06:19:36.958 --> 06:19:38.708 align:start position:0%
signed in in support of the original
bill

06:19:38.708 --> 06:19:38.718 align:start position:0%
bill
 
06:19:40.948 --> 06:19:40.958 align:start position:0%
and i'm sure he will
 
06:19:42.468 --> 06:19:42.478 align:start position:0%
be surprised since he has
 
06:19:44.468 --> 06:19:44.478 align:start position:0%
representatives on the prescription drug
 
06:19:46.548 --> 06:19:46.558 align:start position:0%
affordability affordability board i
 
06:19:48.708 --> 06:19:48.718 align:start position:0%
think he would be surprised that people
 
06:19:50.390 --> 06:19:50.400 align:start position:0%
are trying to take away something that
 
06:19:50.400 --> 06:19:51.270 align:start position:0%
are trying to take away something that
is

06:19:51.270 --> 06:19:51.280 align:start position:0%
is
 
06:19:53.830 --> 06:19:53.840 align:start position:0%
very likely not only to improve access
 
06:19:56.230 --> 06:19:56.240 align:start position:0%
but also decrease fund decrease costs to
 
06:19:57.670 --> 06:19:57.680 align:start position:0%
the state
 
06:19:59.430 --> 06:19:59.440 align:start position:0%
thank you for that answer i would like
 
06:20:00.948 --> 06:20:00.958 align:start position:0%
to caution the committee that
 
06:20:03.350 --> 06:20:03.360 align:start position:0%
speculating on the motives of other
 
06:20:06.868 --> 06:20:06.878 align:start position:0%
people is not an appropriate question
 
06:20:09.430 --> 06:20:09.440 align:start position:0%
we've done it's been done twice and i
 
06:20:11.750 --> 06:20:11.760 align:start position:0%
will not let it happen again
 
06:20:11.760 --> 06:20:12.708 align:start position:0%
will not let it happen again
uh

06:20:12.708 --> 06:20:12.718 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:20:15.270 --> 06:20:15.280 align:start position:0%
if you have anyone has actually received
 
06:20:17.190 --> 06:20:17.200 align:start position:0%
a communication from the governor saying
 
06:20:19.030 --> 06:20:19.040 align:start position:0%
i support this amendment or i'm opposed
 
06:20:20.948 --> 06:20:20.958 align:start position:0%
to this amendment that's a fact and
 
06:20:23.190 --> 06:20:23.200 align:start position:0%
we'll be glad to hear it but i would not
 
06:20:24.628 --> 06:20:24.638 align:start position:0%
i will not listen to any more
 
06:20:27.590 --> 06:20:27.600 align:start position:0%
speculation on that thank you
 
06:20:30.230 --> 06:20:30.240 align:start position:0%
and i i will not speculate on that in
 
06:20:33.030 --> 06:20:33.040 align:start position:0%
the future as well thank you
 
06:20:34.548 --> 06:20:34.558 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
06:20:36.390 --> 06:20:36.400 align:start position:0%
representative lekkis correct
 
06:20:39.350 --> 06:20:39.360 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
06:20:41.270 --> 06:20:41.280 align:start position:0%
well as i stated i agree and i agree
 
06:20:43.110 --> 06:20:43.120 align:start position:0%
with you that the board doesn't have the
 
06:20:45.270 --> 06:20:45.280 align:start position:0%
power to do price fixing
 
06:20:45.280 --> 06:20:46.150 align:start position:0%
power to do price fixing
um

06:20:46.150 --> 06:20:46.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:20:48.788 --> 06:20:48.798 align:start position:0%
i was what i was referring to is in 126
 
06:20:52.868 --> 06:20:52.878 align:start position:0%
bb5 in the rsas
 
06:20:54.390 --> 06:20:54.400 align:start position:0%
roman 3
 
06:20:56.390 --> 06:20:56.400 align:start position:0%
there's a couple of pieces in here the
 
06:20:58.708 --> 06:20:58.718 align:start position:0%
board has the power
 
06:21:00.548 --> 06:21:00.558 align:start position:0%
changing a formulary when sufficient
 
06:21:02.310 --> 06:21:02.320 align:start position:0%
rebates cannot be as
 
06:21:04.468 --> 06:21:04.478 align:start position:0%
secured under some paragraph a
 
06:21:05.750 --> 06:21:05.760 align:start position:0%
and i mean
 
06:21:07.990 --> 06:21:08.000 align:start position:0%
and uh prohibiting health insurance
 
06:21:10.070 --> 06:21:10.080 align:start position:0%
carriers in the state administering
 
06:21:11.750 --> 06:21:11.760 align:start position:0%
benefits for a public payer from
 
06:21:13.590 --> 06:21:13.600 align:start position:0%
offering on their formularies
 
06:21:15.270 --> 06:21:15.280 align:start position:0%
prescription drugs when the method
 
06:21:19.830 --> 06:21:19.840 align:start position:0%
described above is implemented so i mean
 
06:21:21.990 --> 06:21:22.000 align:start position:0%
is it not i mean do you disagree that
 
06:21:24.548 --> 06:21:24.558 align:start position:0%
that in effect makes drugs where they
 
06:21:25.750 --> 06:21:25.760 align:start position:0%
can't get the price they want
 
06:21:25.760 --> 06:21:34.310 align:start position:0%
can't get the price they want
unavailable

06:21:34.310 --> 06:21:34.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:21:36.150 --> 06:21:36.160 align:start position:0%
actually they don't have the power to if
 
06:21:38.070 --> 06:21:38.080 align:start position:0%
you read the paragraph above that under
 
06:21:40.708 --> 06:21:40.718 align:start position:0%
paragraph three what it says is
 
06:21:42.708 --> 06:21:42.718 align:start position:0%
while continuing to ensure adequate
 
06:21:45.350 --> 06:21:45.360 align:start position:0%
access by subscribers to needed
 
06:21:47.830 --> 06:21:47.840 align:start position:0%
prescribed pharmaceutical products
 
06:21:49.430 --> 06:21:49.440 align:start position:0%
the board shall determine whether the
 
06:21:52.628 --> 06:21:52.638 align:start position:0%
following methods reduce costs to
 
06:21:54.788 --> 06:21:54.798 align:start position:0%
individuals purchasing prescription
 
06:21:57.830 --> 06:21:57.840 align:start position:0%
drugs through a public payer and allow
 
06:21:59.990 --> 06:22:00.000 align:start position:0%
public payers to meet the spending
 
06:22:02.788 --> 06:22:02.798 align:start position:0%
targets established under paragraph one
 
06:22:04.310 --> 06:22:04.320 align:start position:0%
it's not saying that the board can
 
06:22:06.868 --> 06:22:06.878 align:start position:0%
actually do that
 
06:22:08.070 --> 06:22:08.080 align:start position:0%
it's saying
 
06:22:10.628 --> 06:22:10.638 align:start position:0%
and it's written right here
 
06:22:13.190 --> 06:22:13.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:22:15.430 --> 06:22:15.440 align:start position:0%
the board shall determine whether the
 
06:22:17.510 --> 06:22:17.520 align:start position:0%
following methods reduce costs it
 
06:22:20.548 --> 06:22:20.558 align:start position:0%
doesn't say the board shall do this
 
06:22:22.788 --> 06:22:22.798 align:start position:0%
it can make a recommendation but it
 
06:22:22.798 --> 06:22:23.990 align:start position:0%
it can make a recommendation but it
doesn't

06:22:23.990 --> 06:22:24.000 align:start position:0%
doesn't
 
06:22:27.510 --> 06:22:27.520 align:start position:0%
tell them what to do and what not to do
 
06:22:29.548 --> 06:22:29.558 align:start position:0%
and and i think that's one of the
 
06:22:31.670 --> 06:22:31.680 align:start position:0%
misunderstandings of what this board
 
06:22:33.350 --> 06:22:33.360 align:start position:0%
this board is not
 
06:22:35.830 --> 06:22:35.840 align:start position:0%
a regulatory body
 
06:22:37.190 --> 06:22:37.200 align:start position:0%
this board
 
06:22:40.070 --> 06:22:40.080 align:start position:0%
is an information gathering body so that
 
06:22:42.468 --> 06:22:42.478 align:start position:0%
the state payers can be as smart as
 
06:22:42.478 --> 06:22:44.390 align:start position:0%
the state payers can be as smart as
possible

06:22:44.390 --> 06:22:44.400 align:start position:0%
possible
 
06:22:47.270 --> 06:22:47.280 align:start position:0%
and then if the state payers have higher
 
06:22:49.910 --> 06:22:49.920 align:start position:0%
costs than one might anticipate based on
 
06:22:49.920 --> 06:22:50.868 align:start position:0%
costs than one might anticipate based on
this

06:22:50.868 --> 06:22:50.878 align:start position:0%
this
 
06:22:53.270 --> 06:22:53.280 align:start position:0%
increased knowledge that the board
 
06:22:53.280 --> 06:22:54.708 align:start position:0%
increased knowledge that the board
has

06:22:54.708 --> 06:22:54.718 align:start position:0%
has
 
06:22:56.868 --> 06:22:56.878 align:start position:0%
then it can identify
 
06:22:58.628 --> 06:22:58.638 align:start position:0%
those and go back and talk with the
 
06:23:01.990 --> 06:23:02.000 align:start position:0%
state payers it would be similar
 
06:23:04.788 --> 06:23:04.798 align:start position:0%
if i if if i prescribe something to a
 
06:23:07.030 --> 06:23:07.040 align:start position:0%
patient i have patients who go
 
06:23:09.030 --> 06:23:09.040 align:start position:0%
they know exactly what the drug is they
 
06:23:11.270 --> 06:23:11.280 align:start position:0%
know what the generics are they know
 
06:23:12.788 --> 06:23:12.798 align:start position:0%
whether there's a
 
06:23:15.510 --> 06:23:15.520 align:start position:0%
rebate form attached to it
 
06:23:17.910 --> 06:23:17.920 align:start position:0%
they do all of the research on their own
 
06:23:20.070 --> 06:23:20.080 align:start position:0%
and it's not easy if you've ever been a
 
06:23:21.670 --> 06:23:21.680 align:start position:0%
patient and you've been prescribed a
 
06:23:24.468 --> 06:23:24.478 align:start position:0%
drug it's not easy to know what's
 
06:23:26.468 --> 06:23:26.478 align:start position:0%
available and what's not available there
 
06:23:28.310 --> 06:23:28.320 align:start position:0%
are coupons there are plastic cards
 
06:23:30.788 --> 06:23:30.798 align:start position:0%
there are discount cards there are all
 
06:23:32.548 --> 06:23:32.558 align:start position:0%
sorts of cards
 
06:23:34.948 --> 06:23:34.958 align:start position:0%
this makes the state
 
06:23:37.110 --> 06:23:37.120 align:start position:0%
that smart patient
 
06:23:39.830 --> 06:23:39.840 align:start position:0%
and that smart patient saves a lot of
 
06:23:41.590 --> 06:23:41.600 align:start position:0%
money when it comes to prescription
 
06:23:44.150 --> 06:23:44.160 align:start position:0%
drugs i can prescribe a drug
 
06:23:46.070 --> 06:23:46.080 align:start position:0%
called remicade
 
06:23:48.390 --> 06:23:48.400 align:start position:0%
that can cost a patient five six
 
06:23:50.830 --> 06:23:50.840 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars for that
 
06:23:54.868 --> 06:23:54.878 align:start position:0%
drug they can get the generic for two
 
06:23:57.030 --> 06:23:57.040 align:start position:0%
the administration of the drug
 
06:23:58.868 --> 06:23:58.878 align:start position:0%
could cost another
 
06:24:01.030 --> 06:24:01.040 align:start position:0%
two to three thousand dollars
 
06:24:03.030 --> 06:24:03.040 align:start position:0%
but the smart patient goes and works
 
06:24:04.708 --> 06:24:04.718 align:start position:0%
with their insurance company or whoever
 
06:24:07.590 --> 06:24:07.600 align:start position:0%
it is to make sure the delivery method
 
06:24:09.910 --> 06:24:09.920 align:start position:0%
is as
 
06:24:12.708 --> 06:24:12.718 align:start position:0%
low cost as possible exact same
 
06:24:12.718 --> 06:24:15.030 align:start position:0%
low cost as possible exact same
formulation

06:24:15.030 --> 06:24:15.040 align:start position:0%
formulation
 
06:24:17.590 --> 06:24:17.600 align:start position:0%
and does the same thing
 
06:24:21.030 --> 06:24:21.040 align:start position:0%
but thousands of dollars cheaper
 
06:24:21.040 --> 06:24:21.750 align:start position:0%
but thousands of dollars cheaper
so

06:24:21.750 --> 06:24:21.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:24:23.670 --> 06:24:23.680 align:start position:0%
what we're suggesting by taking away the
 
06:24:25.350 --> 06:24:25.360 align:start position:0%
prescription drug affordability board
 
06:24:27.190 --> 06:24:27.200 align:start position:0%
which by the way does not use any state
 
06:24:27.200 --> 06:24:28.230 align:start position:0%
which by the way does not use any state
funds

06:24:28.230 --> 06:24:28.240 align:start position:0%
funds
 
06:24:30.310 --> 06:24:30.320 align:start position:0%
it's not a tax we have many fees we have
 
06:24:33.350 --> 06:24:33.360 align:start position:0%
park fees we have many fees out there
 
06:24:35.510 --> 06:24:35.520 align:start position:0%
this uses fees to be
 
06:24:38.310 --> 06:24:38.320 align:start position:0%
as smart as possible to save the state
 
06:24:38.320 --> 06:24:39.350 align:start position:0%
as smart as possible to save the state
money

06:24:39.350 --> 06:24:39.360 align:start position:0%
money
 
06:24:40.948 --> 06:24:40.958 align:start position:0%
that's what this is about it's about
 
06:24:43.190 --> 06:24:43.200 align:start position:0%
making the state a smart patient just
 
06:24:45.670 --> 06:24:45.680 align:start position:0%
like my smart patients are saving
 
06:24:47.270 --> 06:24:47.280 align:start position:0%
multiple thousands of dollars when they
 
06:24:49.350 --> 06:24:49.360 align:start position:0%
know exactly how to
 
06:24:51.510 --> 06:24:51.520 align:start position:0%
use a prescription properly and how to
 
06:24:55.350 --> 06:24:55.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:24:56.310 --> 06:24:56.320 align:start position:0%
all right
 
06:24:57.910 --> 06:24:57.920 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
06:24:59.190 --> 06:24:59.200 align:start position:0%
any other questions representative
 
06:25:01.510 --> 06:25:01.520 align:start position:0%
goalie and then fellow
 
06:25:03.430 --> 06:25:03.440 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair i think this
 
06:25:05.670 --> 06:25:05.680 align:start position:0%
question would probably be addressed to
 
06:25:07.110 --> 06:25:07.120 align:start position:0%
you if i may
 
06:25:09.510 --> 06:25:09.520 align:start position:0%
um the original bill we had dealt with a
 
06:25:12.548 --> 06:25:12.558 align:start position:0%
subject matter that pertained to edna
 
06:25:14.628 --> 06:25:14.638 align:start position:0%
dealing with
 
06:25:17.270 --> 06:25:17.280 align:start position:0%
classified unclassified positions
 
06:25:19.110 --> 06:25:19.120 align:start position:0%
the non-german amendment we have before
 
06:25:20.468 --> 06:25:20.478 align:start position:0%
us now
 
06:25:22.548 --> 06:25:22.558 align:start position:0%
i believe pertains to
 
06:25:23.910 --> 06:25:23.920 align:start position:0%
subject matter that should be in front
 
06:25:25.350 --> 06:25:25.360 align:start position:0%
of health and human services committee
 
06:25:27.110 --> 06:25:27.120 align:start position:0%
not edna
 
06:25:27.120 --> 06:25:28.310 align:start position:0%
not edna
and

06:25:28.310 --> 06:25:28.320 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:25:30.788 --> 06:25:30.798 align:start position:0%
as we talk about process we are once
 
06:25:33.590 --> 06:25:33.600 align:start position:0%
again in a process of
 
06:25:35.190 --> 06:25:35.200 align:start position:0%
subject matter before this committee
 
06:25:37.910 --> 06:25:37.920 align:start position:0%
that we tend to not delve into
 
06:25:39.910 --> 06:25:39.920 align:start position:0%
and i know it's a second committee but i
 
06:25:41.510 --> 06:25:41.520 align:start position:0%
don't think health and human services is
 
06:25:43.910 --> 06:25:43.920 align:start position:0%
a second committee to send this to no
 
06:25:45.830 --> 06:25:45.840 align:start position:0%
but it is possible for the second
 
06:25:48.788 --> 06:25:48.798 align:start position:0%
committee to be changed i know that
 
06:25:52.548 --> 06:25:52.558 align:start position:0%
house bill 1288 which we exact earlier
 
06:25:54.868 --> 06:25:54.878 align:start position:0%
was not an early bill until we attached
 
06:25:56.628 --> 06:25:56.638 align:start position:0%
the non-germain amendment and now it's
 
06:25:59.110 --> 06:25:59.120 align:start position:0%
going to finance i agree with you that
 
06:26:00.708 --> 06:26:00.718 align:start position:0%
this bill should
 
06:26:02.628 --> 06:26:02.638 align:start position:0%
worry to pass the amendment and pass the
 
06:26:05.750 --> 06:26:05.760 align:start position:0%
bill go on to health and human services
 
06:26:10.390 --> 06:26:10.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:26:15.190 --> 06:26:15.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:26:15.200 --> 06:26:16.390 align:start position:0%
 
well

06:26:16.390 --> 06:26:16.400 align:start position:0%
well
 
06:26:18.628 --> 06:26:18.638 align:start position:0%
the reason i'm asking my this question
 
06:26:20.628 --> 06:26:20.638 align:start position:0%
is because i'm not a person who's
 
06:26:22.310 --> 06:26:22.320 align:start position:0%
familiar with this subject and that's
 
06:26:23.590 --> 06:26:23.600 align:start position:0%
why it's so difficult for me to
 
06:26:26.948 --> 06:26:26.958 align:start position:0%
understand but my question is
 
06:26:30.230 --> 06:26:30.240 align:start position:0%
the the public pay the public payers
 
06:26:33.110 --> 06:26:33.120 align:start position:0%
that are covered by
 
06:26:35.190 --> 06:26:35.200 align:start position:0%
whatever information this board might
 
06:26:37.670 --> 06:26:37.680 align:start position:0%
come up with includes places like towns
 
06:26:39.590 --> 06:26:39.600 align:start position:0%
and school districts
 
06:26:39.600 --> 06:26:41.430 align:start position:0%
and school districts
also

06:26:41.430 --> 06:26:41.440 align:start position:0%
also
 
06:26:43.830 --> 06:26:43.840 align:start position:0%
and the way you've just described it
 
06:26:43.840 --> 06:26:45.030 align:start position:0%
and the way you've just described it
somehow

06:26:45.030 --> 06:26:45.040 align:start position:0%
somehow
 
06:26:49.110 --> 06:26:49.120 align:start position:0%
is the objective that somehow
 
06:26:50.310 --> 06:26:50.320 align:start position:0%
they can
 
06:26:53.110 --> 06:26:53.120 align:start position:0%
see that information or
 
06:26:55.750 --> 06:26:55.760 align:start position:0%
to to understand that they can that
 
06:26:57.510 --> 06:26:57.520 align:start position:0%
they're going to prescribe in their
 
06:27:00.708 --> 06:27:00.718 align:start position:0%
insurance company in coverage to that
 
06:27:00.718 --> 06:27:02.070 align:start position:0%
insurance company in coverage to that
one

06:27:02.070 --> 06:27:02.080 align:start position:0%
one
 
06:27:04.868 --> 06:27:04.878 align:start position:0%
the generic is better than the other or
 
06:27:06.788 --> 06:27:06.798 align:start position:0%
why isn't this why don't doctors have
 
06:27:08.548 --> 06:27:08.558 align:start position:0%
access to this information so they
 
06:27:10.868 --> 06:27:10.878 align:start position:0%
prescribe the generic to begin with one
 
06:27:13.670 --> 06:27:13.680 align:start position:0%
of just how is this going to work
 
06:27:13.680 --> 06:27:14.868 align:start position:0%
of just how is this going to work
so

06:27:14.868 --> 06:27:14.878 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:27:19.990 --> 06:27:20.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:27:21.670 --> 06:27:21.680 align:start position:0%
i would love it if you wanted to come to
 
06:27:23.110 --> 06:27:23.120 align:start position:0%
one of our
 
06:27:23.120 --> 06:27:24.468 align:start position:0%
one of our
meetings

06:27:24.468 --> 06:27:24.478 align:start position:0%
meetings
 
06:27:28.628 --> 06:27:28.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:27:30.948 --> 06:27:30.958 align:start position:0%
prescription drug pricing prescription
 
06:27:30.958 --> 06:27:32.070 align:start position:0%
prescription drug pricing prescription
drug

06:27:32.070 --> 06:27:32.080 align:start position:0%
drug
 
06:27:34.390 --> 06:27:34.400 align:start position:0%
coupons i mean we've had bills here in
 
06:27:35.910 --> 06:27:35.920 align:start position:0%
front of the house and over in front of
 
06:27:37.430 --> 06:27:37.440 align:start position:0%
the senate
 
06:27:40.390 --> 06:27:40.400 align:start position:0%
for years trying to figure out how do we
 
06:27:42.230 --> 06:27:42.240 align:start position:0%
do this
 
06:27:45.990 --> 06:27:46.000 align:start position:0%
and the answer is it's complicated
 
06:27:47.670 --> 06:27:47.680 align:start position:0%
it takes
 
06:27:50.868 --> 06:27:50.878 align:start position:0%
a hugely dedicated effort
 
06:27:54.548 --> 06:27:54.558 align:start position:0%
to really understand this environment
 
06:27:56.708 --> 06:27:56.718 align:start position:0%
i would wager that
 
06:27:58.868 --> 06:27:58.878 align:start position:0%
many of us in the medical profession
 
06:28:01.190 --> 06:28:01.200 align:start position:0%
don't fully understand how prescription
 
06:28:02.868 --> 06:28:02.878 align:start position:0%
drug pricing works
 
06:28:07.110 --> 06:28:07.120 align:start position:0%
and we've had actually lectures in in on
 
06:28:09.030 --> 06:28:09.040 align:start position:0%
the board i sit on the board i'm not
 
06:28:11.030 --> 06:28:11.040 align:start position:0%
chair but i sit on the board
 
06:28:14.150 --> 06:28:14.160 align:start position:0%
and it's been eye-opening for me and to
 
06:28:16.468 --> 06:28:16.478 align:start position:0%
think that patients have to go through
 
06:28:16.478 --> 06:28:18.390 align:start position:0%
think that patients have to go through
this

06:28:18.390 --> 06:28:18.400 align:start position:0%
this
 
06:28:21.910 --> 06:28:21.920 align:start position:0%
to figure out how to save money
 
06:28:24.788 --> 06:28:24.798 align:start position:0%
is mind-boggling
 
06:28:26.468 --> 06:28:26.478 align:start position:0%
so what this
 
06:28:26.478 --> 06:28:27.670 align:start position:0%
so what this
does

06:28:27.670 --> 06:28:27.680 align:start position:0%
does
 
06:28:29.670 --> 06:28:29.680 align:start position:0%
and one of the things you you hit on
 
06:28:32.390 --> 06:28:32.400 align:start position:0%
which is really important this isn't
 
06:28:35.270 --> 06:28:35.280 align:start position:0%
likely to just save state money this is
 
06:28:38.708 --> 06:28:38.718 align:start position:0%
likely to decrease property taxes
 
06:28:41.990 --> 06:28:42.000 align:start position:0%
so the the sponsor of the repeal
 
06:28:44.310 --> 06:28:44.320 align:start position:0%
i hope he will understand
 
06:28:47.190 --> 06:28:47.200 align:start position:0%
that the smarter you get
 
06:28:49.510 --> 06:28:49.520 align:start position:0%
as a patient
 
06:28:52.310 --> 06:28:52.320 align:start position:0%
whether you how you pick your doctor
 
06:28:54.390 --> 06:28:54.400 align:start position:0%
you know how many people go to get a
 
06:28:54.400 --> 06:28:56.150 align:start position:0%
you know how many people go to get a
colonoscopy

06:28:56.150 --> 06:28:56.160 align:start position:0%
colonoscopy
 
06:28:57.430 --> 06:28:57.440 align:start position:0%
and know that
 
06:29:00.310 --> 06:29:00.320 align:start position:0%
a good colon i'm a gastroenterologist we
 
06:29:02.948 --> 06:29:02.958 align:start position:0%
follow how good i am
 
06:29:05.430 --> 06:29:05.440 align:start position:0%
at doing colonoscopies we follow what's
 
06:29:07.830 --> 06:29:07.840 align:start position:0%
called adenoma detection rate which is
 
06:29:10.230 --> 06:29:10.240 align:start position:0%
how often the polyps i remove
 
06:29:13.110 --> 06:29:13.120 align:start position:0%
have a pre-cancerous cell in them
 
06:29:15.270 --> 06:29:15.280 align:start position:0%
did you know that only two gi groups in
 
06:29:17.830 --> 06:29:17.840 align:start position:0%
the entire state do that
 
06:29:19.350 --> 06:29:19.360 align:start position:0%
and one of them is dartmouth which is a
 
06:29:22.628 --> 06:29:22.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:29:25.030 --> 06:29:25.040 align:start position:0%
we follow how often
 
06:29:27.430 --> 06:29:27.440 align:start position:0%
or how long it takes a doctor to pull
 
06:29:30.070 --> 06:29:30.080 align:start position:0%
the colonoscope out of the colon
 
06:29:31.830 --> 06:29:31.840 align:start position:0%
because the data shows that if it's
 
06:29:33.510 --> 06:29:33.520 align:start position:0%
under six minutes they're not spending
 
06:29:34.948 --> 06:29:34.958 align:start position:0%
enough time in your colon and they're
 
06:29:37.430 --> 06:29:37.440 align:start position:0%
going to miss colon cancers did you know
 
06:29:37.440 --> 06:29:39.430 align:start position:0%
going to miss colon cancers did you know
that

06:29:39.430 --> 06:29:39.440 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:29:41.910 --> 06:29:41.920 align:start position:0%
do you ask your gi doc when you go in
 
06:29:43.430 --> 06:29:43.440 align:start position:0%
for your screening colonoscopy what's
 
06:29:45.670 --> 06:29:45.680 align:start position:0%
your adenoma detection rate and
 
06:29:47.350 --> 06:29:47.360 align:start position:0%
you know how many
 
06:29:50.150 --> 06:29:50.160 align:start position:0%
how what's your scope withdrawal time no
 
06:29:53.670 --> 06:29:53.680 align:start position:0%
this is even more complicated
 
06:29:54.868 --> 06:29:54.878 align:start position:0%
the state
 
06:29:56.310 --> 06:29:56.320 align:start position:0%
whether it's department of health and
 
06:29:59.190 --> 06:29:59.200 align:start position:0%
human services which has no
 
06:29:59.200 --> 06:30:00.548 align:start position:0%
human services which has no
designated

06:30:00.548 --> 06:30:00.558 align:start position:0%
designated
 
06:30:03.430 --> 06:30:03.440 align:start position:0%
program to do that analysis although we
 
06:30:06.310 --> 06:30:06.320 align:start position:0%
tried a long time ago
 
06:30:08.548 --> 06:30:08.558 align:start position:0%
the department of insurance has no
 
06:30:11.110 --> 06:30:11.120 align:start position:0%
designated program to do that analysis
 
06:30:14.390 --> 06:30:14.400 align:start position:0%
nor do they have the capacity
 
06:30:16.230 --> 06:30:16.240 align:start position:0%
and department of administrative
 
06:30:16.240 --> 06:30:18.230 align:start position:0%
and department of administrative
services

06:30:18.230 --> 06:30:18.240 align:start position:0%
services
 
06:30:20.468 --> 06:30:20.478 align:start position:0%
their reverse auction was in the same
 
06:30:20.478 --> 06:30:22.948 align:start position:0%
their reverse auction was in the same
bill

06:30:22.948 --> 06:30:22.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:30:26.230 --> 06:30:26.240 align:start position:0%
that you all concurred with
 
06:30:30.310 --> 06:30:30.320 align:start position:0%
and it's being touted as a great bill
 
06:30:32.708 --> 06:30:32.718 align:start position:0%
so the point i'm making is this is
 
06:30:34.868 --> 06:30:34.878 align:start position:0%
really complicated the benefit to the
 
06:30:34.878 --> 06:30:36.070 align:start position:0%
really complicated the benefit to the
state

06:30:36.070 --> 06:30:36.080 align:start position:0%
state
 
06:30:37.830 --> 06:30:37.840 align:start position:0%
this is not going to hurt patients or i
 
06:30:40.868 --> 06:30:40.878 align:start position:0%
guarantee you the physicians that were
 
06:30:42.468 --> 06:30:42.478 align:start position:0%
helping with this would not be
 
06:30:44.628 --> 06:30:44.638 align:start position:0%
supporting it because that's my first
 
06:30:46.948 --> 06:30:46.958 align:start position:0%
priority is my patients
 
06:30:49.510 --> 06:30:49.520 align:start position:0%
but what it does is it makes the state a
 
06:30:51.590 --> 06:30:51.600 align:start position:0%
smarter consumer
 
06:30:54.468 --> 06:30:54.478 align:start position:0%
lower state costs that's the goal
 
06:30:56.708 --> 06:30:56.718 align:start position:0%
lowers municipal costs
 
06:30:58.708 --> 06:30:58.718 align:start position:0%
and that translates into lower property
 
06:30:58.718 --> 06:31:00.868 align:start position:0%
and that translates into lower property
taxes

06:31:00.868 --> 06:31:00.878 align:start position:0%
taxes
 
06:31:03.990 --> 06:31:04.000 align:start position:0%
so i appreciate the question the answer
 
06:31:04.000 --> 06:31:04.948 align:start position:0%
so i appreciate the question the answer
is

06:31:04.948 --> 06:31:04.958 align:start position:0%
is
 
06:31:08.070 --> 06:31:08.080 align:start position:0%
this will have a huge impact
 
06:31:10.788 --> 06:31:10.798 align:start position:0%
if you think of what proportion of our
 
06:31:12.868 --> 06:31:12.878 align:start position:0%
state cost goes towards prescription
 
06:31:19.830 --> 06:31:19.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:31:21.350 --> 06:31:21.360 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:31:23.270 --> 06:31:23.280 align:start position:0%
one short follow-up yeah
 
06:31:25.830 --> 06:31:25.840 align:start position:0%
so one of my questions is
 
06:31:27.830 --> 06:31:27.840 align:start position:0%
does every state have to do this on
 
06:31:29.590 --> 06:31:29.600 align:start position:0%
their own because the costs are
 
06:31:32.230 --> 06:31:32.240 align:start position:0%
different from state to state
 
06:31:32.240 --> 06:31:33.430 align:start position:0%
different from state to state
yes

06:31:33.430 --> 06:31:33.440 align:start position:0%
yes
 
06:31:37.190 --> 06:31:37.200 align:start position:0%
thank you that was a short answer
 
06:31:39.910 --> 06:31:39.920 align:start position:0%
i appreciate it representative marsh uh
 
06:31:41.270 --> 06:31:41.280 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chairman thank you
 
06:31:42.868 --> 06:31:42.878 align:start position:0%
senator sherman for coming before us
 
06:31:44.868 --> 06:31:44.878 align:start position:0%
today i ask this as a true informational
 
06:31:46.708 --> 06:31:46.718 align:start position:0%
question because i don't know the answer
 
06:31:48.788 --> 06:31:48.798 align:start position:0%
as you know i'm also a retired physician
 
06:31:51.510 --> 06:31:51.520 align:start position:0%
but i retired five years ago and five
 
06:31:53.510 --> 06:31:53.520 align:start position:0%
years ago when i was doing electronic
 
06:31:55.510 --> 06:31:55.520 align:start position:0%
prescribing which was newer than it is
 
06:31:58.390 --> 06:31:58.400 align:start position:0%
now there was no data presented to your
 
06:32:00.310 --> 06:32:00.320 align:start position:0%
doctor as to the cost of the various
 
06:32:01.750 --> 06:32:01.760 align:start position:0%
alternative medicines that they could
 
06:32:01.760 --> 06:32:03.830 align:start position:0%
alternative medicines that they could
prescribe

06:32:03.830 --> 06:32:03.840 align:start position:0%
prescribe
 
06:32:05.270 --> 06:32:05.280 align:start position:0%
so there was really no way for a
 
06:32:06.868 --> 06:32:06.878 align:start position:0%
physician to do what representative
 
06:32:09.430 --> 06:32:09.440 align:start position:0%
fellows said that is to compare the cost
 
06:32:11.350 --> 06:32:11.360 align:start position:0%
of alternative modes of treatment has
 
06:32:12.948 --> 06:32:12.958 align:start position:0%
anything been done to increase
 
06:32:14.948 --> 06:32:14.958 align:start position:0%
transparency to physicians in the
 
06:32:16.788 --> 06:32:16.798 align:start position:0%
interim time
 
06:32:19.270 --> 06:32:19.280 align:start position:0%
not in my experience
 
06:32:20.948 --> 06:32:20.958 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:32:23.510 --> 06:32:23.520 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
06:32:25.430 --> 06:32:25.440 align:start position:0%
representative grota
 
06:32:28.548 --> 06:32:28.558 align:start position:0%
i think it's going to be short
 
06:32:30.548 --> 06:32:30.558 align:start position:0%
so when you're making when you're buying
 
06:32:32.548 --> 06:32:32.558 align:start position:0%
a table
 
06:32:34.310 --> 06:32:34.320 align:start position:0%
there's a supply chain
 
06:32:37.510 --> 06:32:37.520 align:start position:0%
that you can analyze and you can analyze
 
06:32:39.430 --> 06:32:39.440 align:start position:0%
how much the raw materials are how much
 
06:32:41.670 --> 06:32:41.680 align:start position:0%
it costs to make the table how much it
 
06:32:43.110 --> 06:32:43.120 align:start position:0%
costs to paint the table how much it
 
06:32:46.150 --> 06:32:46.160 align:start position:0%
costs to sell the table table table
 
06:32:48.628 --> 06:32:48.638 align:start position:0%
to a
 
06:32:50.390 --> 06:32:50.400 align:start position:0%
walmart or
 
06:32:52.070 --> 06:32:52.080 align:start position:0%
you know there's there are costs
 
06:32:54.070 --> 06:32:54.080 align:start position:0%
associated with all along the way that
 
06:32:56.070 --> 06:32:56.080 align:start position:0%
supply chain
 
06:32:59.590 --> 06:32:59.600 align:start position:0%
so are we
 
06:33:02.708 --> 06:33:02.718 align:start position:0%
is there such is there a similar
 
06:33:04.310 --> 06:33:04.320 align:start position:0%
supply chain
 
06:33:06.150 --> 06:33:06.160 align:start position:0%
for pharmaceuticals
 
06:33:08.150 --> 06:33:08.160 align:start position:0%
or is it
 
06:33:10.788 --> 06:33:10.798 align:start position:0%
is that is that analogy
 
06:33:10.798 --> 06:33:13.750 align:start position:0%
is that is that analogy
inappropriate

06:33:13.750 --> 06:33:13.760 align:start position:0%
inappropriate
 
06:33:17.830 --> 06:33:17.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:33:20.390 --> 06:33:20.400 align:start position:0%
there is a supply chain
 
06:33:21.910 --> 06:33:21.920 align:start position:0%
but it
 
06:33:23.670 --> 06:33:23.680 align:start position:0%
for the same
 
06:33:26.628 --> 06:33:26.638 align:start position:0%
medication it could go through multiple
 
06:33:28.310 --> 06:33:28.320 align:start position:0%
different routes
 
06:33:30.230 --> 06:33:30.240 align:start position:0%
with multiple different levels of
 
06:33:30.240 --> 06:33:31.990 align:start position:0%
with multiple different levels of
pricing

06:33:31.990 --> 06:33:32.000 align:start position:0%
pricing
 
06:33:34.708 --> 06:33:34.718 align:start position:0%
you know whether it's wholesalers pbms
 
06:33:38.628 --> 06:33:38.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:33:41.350 --> 06:33:41.360 align:start position:0%
so the short answer is
 
06:33:43.350 --> 06:33:43.360 align:start position:0%
yes but remember
 
06:33:45.270 --> 06:33:45.280 align:start position:0%
one of the things that the board has
 
06:33:47.910 --> 06:33:47.920 align:start position:0%
access to
 
06:33:50.390 --> 06:33:50.400 align:start position:0%
because it has that confidential
 
06:33:53.030 --> 06:33:53.040 align:start position:0%
confidentiality component is it has
 
06:33:55.910 --> 06:33:55.920 align:start position:0%
access to the supply chain
 
06:33:59.030 --> 06:33:59.040 align:start position:0%
on the proprietary side so
 
06:34:02.310 --> 06:34:02.320 align:start position:0%
that's why it's so important
 
06:34:04.468 --> 06:34:04.478 align:start position:0%
to have the board because
 
06:34:04.478 --> 06:34:05.830 align:start position:0%
to have the board because
dhhs

06:34:05.830 --> 06:34:05.840 align:start position:0%
dhhs
 
06:34:07.788 --> 06:34:07.798 align:start position:0%
can't even have access to that
 
06:34:10.468 --> 06:34:10.478 align:start position:0%
proprietary information
 
06:34:12.230 --> 06:34:12.240 align:start position:0%
department of insurance
 
06:34:14.310 --> 06:34:14.320 align:start position:0%
can't necessarily have access to that
 
06:34:16.390 --> 06:34:16.400 align:start position:0%
proprietary information but this board
 
06:34:16.400 --> 06:34:18.150 align:start position:0%
proprietary information but this board
can

06:34:18.150 --> 06:34:18.160 align:start position:0%
can
 
06:34:21.670 --> 06:34:21.680 align:start position:0%
and it can't change the prices it can't
 
06:34:24.868 --> 06:34:24.878 align:start position:0%
change the coupons it can't change any
 
06:34:26.708 --> 06:34:26.718 align:start position:0%
of that
 
06:34:28.150 --> 06:34:28.160 align:start position:0%
this is not
 
06:34:29.750 --> 06:34:29.760 align:start position:0%
anything standing in the way of free
 
06:34:33.510 --> 06:34:33.520 align:start position:0%
market this is standing in the way
 
06:34:36.708 --> 06:34:36.718 align:start position:0%
in the setting of a smart consumer
 
06:34:38.548 --> 06:34:38.558 align:start position:0%
being able to fully understand the
 
06:34:38.558 --> 06:34:39.670 align:start position:0%
being able to fully understand the
market

06:34:39.670 --> 06:34:39.680 align:start position:0%
market
 
06:34:42.070 --> 06:34:42.080 align:start position:0%
and then make their purchases as wisely
 
06:34:44.628 --> 06:34:44.638 align:start position:0%
as possible
 
06:34:49.990 --> 06:34:50.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:34:51.270 --> 06:34:51.280 align:start position:0%
you madam chair
 
06:34:53.590 --> 06:34:53.600 align:start position:0%
i work for the city of manchester and
 
06:34:54.868 --> 06:34:54.878 align:start position:0%
the city of manchester being
 
06:34:57.270 --> 06:34:57.280 align:start position:0%
self-insured has a substantial vested
 
06:34:59.190 --> 06:34:59.200 align:start position:0%
interest in keeping their costs down as
 
06:35:01.670 --> 06:35:01.680 align:start position:0%
a municipality when one of the programs
 
06:35:03.030 --> 06:35:03.040 align:start position:0%
that they offer is something called the
 
06:35:05.110 --> 06:35:05.120 align:start position:0%
smart shopper which you may or may not
 
06:35:07.830 --> 06:35:07.840 align:start position:0%
be familiar with but okay so
 
06:35:09.110 --> 06:35:09.120 align:start position:0%
in that what that does is that
 
06:35:12.708 --> 06:35:12.718 align:start position:0%
incentivizes me as a end user
 
06:35:12.718 --> 06:35:14.468 align:start position:0%
incentivizes me as a end user
to

06:35:14.468 --> 06:35:14.478 align:start position:0%
to
 
06:35:17.030 --> 06:35:17.040 align:start position:0%
potentially go with a lower cost option
 
06:35:20.390 --> 06:35:20.400 align:start position:0%
and i'm subsequently rewarded for
 
06:35:22.390 --> 06:35:22.400 align:start position:0%
potential choices that that fall under
 
06:35:25.030 --> 06:35:25.040 align:start position:0%
that okay and i'm in an hsa and that i'm
 
06:35:26.708 --> 06:35:26.718 align:start position:0%
paying out of paying it anyway and that
 
06:35:28.788 --> 06:35:28.798 align:start position:0%
that benefits me as well is there
 
06:35:31.430 --> 06:35:31.440 align:start position:0%
anything going on in
 
06:35:33.430 --> 06:35:33.440 align:start position:0%
this world
 
06:35:35.670 --> 06:35:35.680 align:start position:0%
similar to smart chopper when it comes
 
06:35:37.990 --> 06:35:38.000 align:start position:0%
to prescription drugs where people can
 
06:35:39.430 --> 06:35:39.440 align:start position:0%
say hey
 
06:35:42.628 --> 06:35:42.638 align:start position:0%
i got a chart if i get it at rite aid
 
06:35:44.948 --> 06:35:44.958 align:start position:0%
versus you know joe's online versus
 
06:35:49.030 --> 06:35:49.040 align:start position:0%
whatever where i am now steered towards
 
06:35:50.868 --> 06:35:50.878 align:start position:0%
solving my problem of the
 
06:35:53.910 --> 06:35:53.920 align:start position:0%
filling a prescription i need but also
 
06:35:56.788 --> 06:35:56.798 align:start position:0%
doing it in a way where
 
06:35:58.788 --> 06:35:58.798 align:start position:0%
i can
 
06:36:00.788 --> 06:36:00.798 align:start position:0%
utilize the free market economy and
 
06:36:03.830 --> 06:36:03.840 align:start position:0%
choose the lowest cost does that exist
 
06:36:05.510 --> 06:36:05.520 align:start position:0%
like anywhere like it does for smart
 
06:36:07.510 --> 06:36:07.520 align:start position:0%
shopper for mammography or
 
06:36:10.070 --> 06:36:10.080 align:start position:0%
those various things
 
06:36:11.670 --> 06:36:11.680 align:start position:0%
uh so
 
06:36:13.670 --> 06:36:13.680 align:start position:0%
what you last said about mammography
 
06:36:15.590 --> 06:36:15.600 align:start position:0%
there is something the new hampshire
 
06:36:18.150 --> 06:36:18.160 align:start position:0%
insurance department has a new hampshire
 
06:36:20.468 --> 06:36:20.478 align:start position:0%
health cost website
 
06:36:23.510 --> 06:36:23.520 align:start position:0%
which by the way tyler brannon developed
 
06:36:25.830 --> 06:36:25.840 align:start position:0%
on his own and it has won national
 
06:36:25.840 --> 06:36:28.390 align:start position:0%
on his own and it has won national
awards

06:36:28.390 --> 06:36:28.400 align:start position:0%
awards
 
06:36:31.670 --> 06:36:31.680 align:start position:0%
and it uses utilization data to actually
 
06:36:34.070 --> 06:36:34.080 align:start position:0%
figure out what the actual costs are to
 
06:36:36.708 --> 06:36:36.718 align:start position:0%
the patient so that if if you needed a
 
06:36:39.270 --> 06:36:39.280 align:start position:0%
colonoscopy you could go to that website
 
06:36:41.430 --> 06:36:41.440 align:start position:0%
and it would tell you
 
06:36:43.708 --> 06:36:43.718 align:start position:0%
you know where in the state that's for
 
06:36:45.590 --> 06:36:45.600 align:start position:0%
procedures and
 
06:36:48.548 --> 06:36:48.558 align:start position:0%
and x-rays and things like that and
 
06:36:50.708 --> 06:36:50.718 align:start position:0%
there's a code attached to those so it's
 
06:36:53.030 --> 06:36:53.040 align:start position:0%
really pretty easy for them to say
 
06:36:55.190 --> 06:36:55.200 align:start position:0%
okay for this code what are all the
 
06:36:57.590 --> 06:36:57.600 align:start position:0%
prices around the state
 
06:36:58.948 --> 06:36:58.958 align:start position:0%
and tyler's
 
06:37:01.430 --> 06:37:01.440 align:start position:0%
you know amazing work just here in new
 
06:37:01.440 --> 06:37:03.670 align:start position:0%
you know amazing work just here in new
hampshire

06:37:03.670 --> 06:37:03.680 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
06:37:05.590 --> 06:37:05.600 align:start position:0%
but i don't know of anything on the
 
06:37:07.430 --> 06:37:07.440 align:start position:0%
prescription drug side
 
06:37:09.510 --> 06:37:09.520 align:start position:0%
that has that kind of
 
06:37:09.520 --> 06:37:11.510 align:start position:0%
that has that kind of
affordability

06:37:11.510 --> 06:37:11.520 align:start position:0%
affordability
 
06:37:13.830 --> 06:37:13.840 align:start position:0%
or the you know remember the complexity
 
06:37:15.430 --> 06:37:15.440 align:start position:0%
of it is
 
06:37:17.910 --> 06:37:17.920 align:start position:0%
there are as i mentioned there are cards
 
06:37:20.948 --> 06:37:20.958 align:start position:0%
discount cards there are rebate systems
 
06:37:23.270 --> 06:37:23.280 align:start position:0%
so you almost don't know until you have
 
06:37:25.510 --> 06:37:25.520 align:start position:0%
the prescription in hand
 
06:37:27.510 --> 06:37:27.520 align:start position:0%
what all your options are and there's no
 
06:37:29.510 --> 06:37:29.520 align:start position:0%
great you know sort of one-stop shopping
 
06:37:32.150 --> 06:37:32.160 align:start position:0%

06:37:48.230 --> 06:37:48.240 align:start position:0%
don't really care who trucked it and
 
06:37:48.240 --> 06:37:49.190 align:start position:0%
don't really care who trucked it and
i

06:37:49.190 --> 06:37:49.200 align:start position:0%
i
 
06:37:50.468 --> 06:37:50.478 align:start position:0%
i guess i care that you bought it at
 
06:37:51.750 --> 06:37:51.760 align:start position:0%
rite aid but i'll plug my wife's
 
06:37:53.270 --> 06:37:53.280 align:start position:0%

06:37:53.280 --> 06:37:54.628 align:start position:0%
employer here but
um

06:37:54.628 --> 06:37:54.638 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:37:56.468 --> 06:37:56.478 align:start position:0%
you know the particulars of that
 
06:37:58.230 --> 06:37:58.240 align:start position:0%
irrelevant to me right i'm just the guy
 
06:37:59.830 --> 06:37:59.840 align:start position:0%
that's got to pay and buy this i got to
 
06:38:02.708 --> 06:38:02.718 align:start position:0%
fill this prescription so is is that
 
06:38:07.590 --> 06:38:07.600 align:start position:0%
type of of end consumer benefit part of
 
06:38:10.468 --> 06:38:10.478 align:start position:0%
what this board would ever be involved
 
06:38:13.110 --> 06:38:13.120 align:start position:0%
in or is that an end goal of this board
 
06:38:15.110 --> 06:38:15.120 align:start position:0%
or how does that even tie into this
 
06:38:18.070 --> 06:38:18.080 align:start position:0%
board's world in any way
 
06:38:21.350 --> 06:38:21.360 align:start position:0%
the short answer is my belief is
 
06:38:21.360 --> 06:38:23.030 align:start position:0%
the short answer is my belief is
no

06:38:23.030 --> 06:38:23.040 align:start position:0%
no
 
06:38:24.548 --> 06:38:24.558 align:start position:0%
because this is really focused on the
 
06:38:27.030 --> 06:38:27.040 align:start position:0%
state and the state costs
 
06:38:30.468 --> 06:38:30.478 align:start position:0%
could a similar board be constructed
 
06:38:32.830 --> 06:38:32.840 align:start position:0%
to to do what you're
 
06:38:35.190 --> 06:38:35.200 align:start position:0%
describing um
 
06:38:38.150 --> 06:38:38.160 align:start position:0%
you know i'm not sure you could
 
06:38:39.430 --> 06:38:39.440 align:start position:0%
unless it were
 
06:38:39.440 --> 06:38:41.110 align:start position:0%
unless it were
federal

06:38:41.110 --> 06:38:41.120 align:start position:0%
federal
 
06:38:43.590 --> 06:38:43.600 align:start position:0%
legislation or something in a much
 
06:38:45.190 --> 06:38:45.200 align:start position:0%
broader scale
 
06:38:46.868 --> 06:38:46.878 align:start position:0%
i just don't know how somebody could get
 
06:38:49.350 --> 06:38:49.360 align:start position:0%
access to all that data representative
 
06:38:51.270 --> 06:38:51.280 align:start position:0%
pearson you might ask your insurance
 
06:38:53.510 --> 06:38:53.520 align:start position:0%
company because i know mine does that
 
06:38:56.310 --> 06:38:56.320 align:start position:0%
they they say if you buy this drug at
 
06:38:58.150 --> 06:38:58.160 align:start position:0%
walmart it's one price if you buy it at
 
06:39:01.110 --> 06:39:01.120 align:start position:0%
rite aids this is what the price is
 
06:39:03.510 --> 06:39:03.520 align:start position:0%
right if i could just add to that
 
06:39:04.948 --> 06:39:04.958 align:start position:0%
the insurance company is a great
 
06:39:06.708 --> 06:39:06.718 align:start position:0%
reference for this
 
06:39:08.868 --> 06:39:08.878 align:start position:0%
but if you are uninsured one thing about
 
06:39:10.780 --> 06:39:10.790 align:start position:0%

health cost
 
06:39:16.230 --> 06:39:16.240 align:start position:0%
website is that it has both insured and
 
06:39:19.190 --> 06:39:19.200 align:start position:0%
uninsured costs on it so
 
06:39:21.350 --> 06:39:21.360 align:start position:0%
it really depends on your insurance and
 
06:39:22.948 --> 06:39:22.958 align:start position:0%
and you know everybody's insurance
 
06:39:24.708 --> 06:39:24.718 align:start position:0%
benefit is different and the insurance
 
06:39:26.468 --> 06:39:26.478 align:start position:0%
companies might contract with a
 
06:39:28.230 --> 06:39:28.240 align:start position:0%
different pbm or they might have their
 
06:39:31.270 --> 06:39:31.280 align:start position:0%
own internal ppm that's why it's so hard
 
06:39:33.350 --> 06:39:33.360 align:start position:0%
to do with prescription drugs and and
 
06:39:35.990 --> 06:39:36.000 align:start position:0%
really that's the environment that this
 
06:39:38.708 --> 06:39:38.718 align:start position:0%
board is trying to understand on behalf
 
06:39:40.868 --> 06:39:40.878 align:start position:0%
of the state
 
06:39:42.230 --> 06:39:42.240 align:start position:0%
representative goalie did you have a
 
06:39:42.240 --> 06:39:44.310 align:start position:0%
representative goalie did you have a
question

06:39:44.310 --> 06:39:44.320 align:start position:0%
question
 
06:39:46.230 --> 06:39:46.240 align:start position:0%
just a real brief question if i may i
 
06:39:47.590 --> 06:39:47.600 align:start position:0%
don't know if the doctor can answer this
 
06:39:48.788 --> 06:39:48.798 align:start position:0%
or not but
 
06:39:51.670 --> 06:39:51.680 align:start position:0%
is there instances out there where
 
06:39:53.030 --> 06:39:53.040 align:start position:0%
those consumers that don't have
 
06:39:53.040 --> 06:39:54.868 align:start position:0%
those consumers that don't have
insurance

06:39:54.868 --> 06:39:54.878 align:start position:0%
insurance
 
06:39:57.350 --> 06:39:57.360 align:start position:0%
can actually get a cheaper product than
 
06:39:57.360 --> 06:39:58.628 align:start position:0%
can actually get a cheaper product than
what

06:39:58.628 --> 06:39:58.638 align:start position:0%
what
 
06:40:00.310 --> 06:40:00.320 align:start position:0%
a pharmacy may be charging an insurance
 
06:40:06.390 --> 06:40:06.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:40:09.430 --> 06:40:09.440 align:start position:0%
typically those without insurance i mean
 
06:40:12.070 --> 06:40:12.080 align:start position:0%
i can go one on one to a pharmaceutical
 
06:40:13.990 --> 06:40:14.000 align:start position:0%
and say i need this for this patient and
 
06:40:15.270 --> 06:40:15.280 align:start position:0%
there will be
 
06:40:17.510 --> 06:40:17.520 align:start position:0%
compassionate care protocols within that
 
06:40:19.590 --> 06:40:19.600 align:start position:0%
company to get it either for free or at
 
06:40:21.510 --> 06:40:21.520 align:start position:0%
a sharp discount if that's what you're
 
06:40:21.520 --> 06:40:22.548 align:start position:0%
a sharp discount if that's what you're
asking

06:40:22.548 --> 06:40:22.558 align:start position:0%
asking
 
06:40:25.270 --> 06:40:25.280 align:start position:0%
it for me it it my experience has always
 
06:40:27.270 --> 06:40:27.280 align:start position:0%
been one-on-one so
 
06:40:29.750 --> 06:40:29.760 align:start position:0%
if i have a patient who can't afford it
 
06:40:32.230 --> 06:40:32.240 align:start position:0%
doesn't have insurance i will go to the
 
06:40:34.468 --> 06:40:34.478 align:start position:0%
pharmaceutical and see if we can get it
 
06:40:36.948 --> 06:40:36.958 align:start position:0%
on a compassionate level or some kind of
 
06:40:38.708 --> 06:40:38.718 align:start position:0%
they have all of the pharmaceuticals
 
06:40:43.990 --> 06:40:44.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:40:47.830 --> 06:40:47.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:40:52.230 --> 06:40:52.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:41:23.350 --> 06:41:23.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:41:23.360 --> 06:41:54.788 align:start position:0%
 
um

06:41:54.788 --> 06:41:54.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:41:56.788 --> 06:41:56.798 align:start position:0%
waiting for the
 
06:42:20.788 --> 06:42:20.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:42:20.798 --> 06:42:36.788 align:start position:0%
 
okay

06:42:36.788 --> 06:42:36.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:42:51.030 --> 06:42:51.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:42:51.040 --> 06:43:48.468 align:start position:0%
 
so

06:43:48.468 --> 06:43:48.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:43:49.670 --> 06:43:49.680 align:start position:0%

complicated non-transparent pharmacy
 
06:44:40.468 --> 06:44:40.478 align:start position:0%

it's not straightforward
 
06:44:55.110 --> 06:44:55.120 align:start position:0%
if you want to look at the
 
06:44:56.948 --> 06:44:56.958 align:start position:0%
flow of the dollar it's different than
 
06:44:58.948 --> 06:44:58.958 align:start position:0%
the flow of the drug itself
 
06:45:00.948 --> 06:45:00.958 align:start position:0%
there are many players that are involved
 
06:45:02.150 --> 06:45:02.160 align:start position:0%
with the pricing of the prescription
 
06:45:02.160 --> 06:45:03.750 align:start position:0%
with the pricing of the prescription
drug

06:45:03.750 --> 06:45:03.760 align:start position:0%
drug
 
06:45:04.830 --> 06:45:04.840 align:start position:0%
from the
 
06:45:07.670 --> 06:45:07.680 align:start position:0%
manufacturer to the pbm
 
06:45:09.190 --> 06:45:09.200 align:start position:0%
the wholesaler
 
06:45:10.310 --> 06:45:10.320 align:start position:0%
as well as the pharmacy and the
 
06:45:14.708 --> 06:45:14.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:45:16.548 --> 06:45:16.558 align:start position:0%
because of the complexity
 
06:45:18.948 --> 06:45:18.958 align:start position:0%
of what we have before you
 
06:45:21.030 --> 06:45:21.040 align:start position:0%
it took me 30 some odd years to begin to
 
06:45:22.788 --> 06:45:22.798 align:start position:0%
really understand this
 
06:45:25.110 --> 06:45:25.120 align:start position:0%
and who the players are um i mean it
 
06:45:26.948 --> 06:45:26.958 align:start position:0%
without sincerity
 
06:45:28.948 --> 06:45:28.958 align:start position:0%
i worked with dartmouth hitchcock
 
06:45:31.110 --> 06:45:31.120 align:start position:0%
in the pharmaceutical supply chain with
 
06:45:32.628 --> 06:45:32.638 align:start position:0%
over a quarter of a billion dollars a
 
06:45:36.468 --> 06:45:36.478 align:start position:0%
year in contracts this is a complex area
 
06:45:39.670 --> 06:45:39.680 align:start position:0%
and if you don't know how to navigate it
 
06:45:41.510 --> 06:45:41.520 align:start position:0%
you're going to have a problem because
 
06:45:43.030 --> 06:45:43.040 align:start position:0%
you're going to basically have the issue
 
06:45:44.708 --> 06:45:44.718 align:start position:0%
of buyer beware
 
06:45:46.628 --> 06:45:46.638 align:start position:0%
so if you don't have an educated buyer
 
06:45:47.750 --> 06:45:47.760 align:start position:0%
before you
 
06:45:49.670 --> 06:45:49.680 align:start position:0%
whether it be a hospital which i
 
06:45:52.868 --> 06:45:52.878 align:start position:0%
represented at that time or a patient
 
06:45:55.430 --> 06:45:55.440 align:start position:0%
the system is stacked against them
 
06:45:57.990 --> 06:45:58.000 align:start position:0%
there's too many parts to it that truly
 
06:46:01.270 --> 06:46:01.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:46:03.750 --> 06:46:03.760 align:start position:0%
to give you another example
 
06:46:05.750 --> 06:46:05.760 align:start position:0%
a recent report by the berkeley research
 
06:46:05.760 --> 06:46:06.628 align:start position:0%
a recent report by the berkeley research
group

06:46:06.628 --> 06:46:06.638 align:start position:0%
group
 
06:46:09.590 --> 06:46:09.600 align:start position:0%
showed in 2023
 
06:46:12.548 --> 06:46:12.558 align:start position:0%
67 percent
 
06:46:15.110 --> 06:46:15.120 align:start position:0%
of the gross expenditures brand
 
06:46:17.270 --> 06:46:17.280 align:start position:0%
branded prescription drugs went to the
 
06:46:20.948 --> 06:46:20.958 align:start position:0%
manufacturer 67 percent folks
 
06:46:23.350 --> 06:46:23.360 align:start position:0%
in 2020
 
06:46:26.390 --> 06:46:26.400 align:start position:0%
that's now down to less than 50 percent
 
06:46:28.708 --> 06:46:28.718 align:start position:0%
that's a 25 percent decrease the
 
06:46:31.030 --> 06:46:31.040 align:start position:0%
manufacturers are taking in
 
06:46:33.430 --> 06:46:33.440 align:start position:0%
on their bottom line to pay for their
 
06:46:35.750 --> 06:46:35.760 align:start position:0%
cost of services
 
06:46:37.430 --> 06:46:37.440 align:start position:0%
the other one i showed you is the one
 
06:46:39.190 --> 06:46:39.200 align:start position:0%
from lily
 
06:46:40.548 --> 06:46:40.558 align:start position:0%
we always talk about insulin i thought
 
06:46:43.270 --> 06:46:43.280 align:start position:0%
this is important to the committee
 
06:46:46.070 --> 06:46:46.080 align:start position:0%
if you look at the graph in 2016 the
 
06:46:47.990 --> 06:46:48.000 align:start position:0%
list price which is what we base
 
06:46:50.468 --> 06:46:50.478 align:start position:0%
the price that the patients on
 
06:46:55.510 --> 06:46:55.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:46:57.990 --> 06:46:58.000 align:start position:0%
five years later it increased to 275
 
06:47:00.150 --> 06:47:00.160 align:start position:0%
dollars for that vial
 
06:47:00.160 --> 06:47:02.150 align:start position:0%
dollars for that vial
however

06:47:02.150 --> 06:47:02.160 align:start position:0%
however
 
06:47:03.830 --> 06:47:03.840 align:start position:0%
the net price to the manufacturer went
 
06:47:07.350 --> 06:47:07.360 align:start position:0%
from 59 down to 50.
 
06:47:09.190 --> 06:47:09.200 align:start position:0%
so i would ask this committee along with
 
06:47:09.990 --> 06:47:10.000 align:start position:0%
what we're trying to do here at the
 
06:47:12.868 --> 06:47:12.878 align:start position:0%
prescription drug affordability award
 
06:47:15.750 --> 06:47:15.760 align:start position:0%
where what is going on
 
06:47:17.750 --> 06:47:17.760 align:start position:0%
why are drug prices paid by patients
 
06:47:19.510 --> 06:47:19.520 align:start position:0%
increasing while net prices and
 
06:47:22.230 --> 06:47:22.240 align:start position:0%
manufacturers are decreasing
 
06:47:25.190 --> 06:47:25.200 align:start position:0%
where is the money going
 
06:47:27.590 --> 06:47:27.600 align:start position:0%
the legislation passed in 2020 was to
 
06:47:30.070 --> 06:47:30.080 align:start position:0%
try to help the state navigate these
 
06:47:31.590 --> 06:47:31.600 align:start position:0%
chartered waters
 
06:47:34.708 --> 06:47:34.718 align:start position:0%
to bring transparency to the system
 
06:47:36.868 --> 06:47:36.878 align:start position:0%
for the state
 
06:47:39.350 --> 06:47:39.360 align:start position:0%
another study which was recently
 
06:47:41.750 --> 06:47:41.760 align:start position:0%
produced in 2020 2018
 
06:47:44.628 --> 06:47:44.638 align:start position:0%
by the university of southern california
 
06:47:47.190 --> 06:47:47.200 align:start position:0%
showed you look back at the numbers
 
06:47:49.270 --> 06:47:49.280 align:start position:0%
that the patients overpaid
 
06:47:52.948 --> 06:47:52.958 align:start position:0%
on their prescriptions 23 of the time
 
06:47:56.548 --> 06:47:56.558 align:start position:0%
23 of the time by almost eight dollars
 
06:47:56.558 --> 06:47:57.590 align:start position:0%
23 of the time by almost eight dollars
why

06:47:57.590 --> 06:47:57.600 align:start position:0%
why
 
06:47:59.190 --> 06:47:59.200 align:start position:0%
i don't have the answer
 
06:48:00.390 --> 06:48:00.400 align:start position:0%
but the goal of the prescription drug
 
06:48:01.830 --> 06:48:01.840 align:start position:0%
affordability board is to find the
 
06:48:01.840 --> 06:48:02.868 align:start position:0%
affordability board is to find the
answers

06:48:02.868 --> 06:48:02.878 align:start position:0%
answers
 
06:48:04.628 --> 06:48:04.638 align:start position:0%
to help the patients to help the state
 
06:48:07.110 --> 06:48:07.120 align:start position:0%
navigate this complex
 
06:48:07.120 --> 06:48:09.510 align:start position:0%
navigate this complex
system

06:48:09.510 --> 06:48:09.520 align:start position:0%
system
 
06:48:10.868 --> 06:48:10.878 align:start position:0%
in regards to a couple of things we
 
06:48:13.030 --> 06:48:13.040 align:start position:0%
talked about before
 
06:48:16.390 --> 06:48:16.400 align:start position:0%
there is no pricing authority in this
 
06:48:18.548 --> 06:48:18.558 align:start position:0%
the us constitution
 
06:48:20.468 --> 06:48:20.478 align:start position:0%
commerce clause prohibits states from
 
06:48:23.830 --> 06:48:23.840 align:start position:0%
setting pricing
 
06:48:26.708 --> 06:48:26.718 align:start position:0%
in regards to confidentiality as senator
 
06:48:28.070 --> 06:48:28.080 align:start position:0%
sherman said
 
06:48:29.750 --> 06:48:29.760 align:start position:0%
a lot of the data we're trying to obtain
 
06:48:31.350 --> 06:48:31.360 align:start position:0%
from them to better understand what is
 
06:48:32.948 --> 06:48:32.958 align:start position:0%
going on
 
06:48:35.510 --> 06:48:35.520 align:start position:0%
is predicated upon prior to proprietary
 
06:48:35.520 --> 06:48:36.548 align:start position:0%
is predicated upon prior to proprietary
data

06:48:36.548 --> 06:48:36.558 align:start position:0%
data
 
06:48:39.510 --> 06:48:39.520 align:start position:0%
that needs to remain confidential
 
06:48:40.868 --> 06:48:40.878 align:start position:0%
and therefore
 
06:48:43.750 --> 06:48:43.760 align:start position:0%
it needs to remain in that capacity
 
06:48:46.310 --> 06:48:46.320 align:start position:0%
to invite other members to the board to
 
06:48:47.910 --> 06:48:47.920 align:start position:0%
have a vested interest in what we're
 
06:48:47.920 --> 06:48:48.788 align:start position:0%
have a vested interest in what we're
doing

06:48:48.788 --> 06:48:48.798 align:start position:0%
doing
 
06:48:50.788 --> 06:48:50.798 align:start position:0%
we'd be counterproductive no one would
 
06:48:52.948 --> 06:48:52.958 align:start position:0%
share with the board the information if
 
06:48:54.948 --> 06:48:54.958 align:start position:0%
they have representation from
 
06:48:56.548 --> 06:48:56.558 align:start position:0%
other competing
 
06:48:58.708 --> 06:48:58.718 align:start position:0%
entities within supply chain including
 
06:49:02.070 --> 06:49:02.080 align:start position:0%
pharma pbms and so forth
 
06:49:03.430 --> 06:49:03.440 align:start position:0%
regards to the dollars that we're
 
06:49:05.590 --> 06:49:05.600 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
06:49:07.830 --> 06:49:07.840 align:start position:0%
the initial estimate we had before the
 
06:49:07.840 --> 06:49:08.868 align:start position:0%
the initial estimate we had before the
board

06:49:08.868 --> 06:49:08.878 align:start position:0%
board
 
06:49:10.390 --> 06:49:10.400 align:start position:0%
was 1700
 
06:49:10.400 --> 06:49:11.590 align:start position:0%
was 1700
entities

06:49:11.590 --> 06:49:11.600 align:start position:0%
entities
 
06:49:12.628 --> 06:49:12.638 align:start position:0%
that came from the office of
 
06:49:16.230 --> 06:49:16.240 align:start position:0%
professional licensure and certification
 
06:49:18.788 --> 06:49:18.798 align:start position:0%
that was based upon a permit they
 
06:49:21.830 --> 06:49:21.840 align:start position:0%
issued to wholesalers manufacturers
 
06:49:21.840 --> 06:49:23.350 align:start position:0%
issued to wholesalers manufacturers
brokers

06:49:23.350 --> 06:49:23.360 align:start position:0%
brokers
 
06:49:25.030 --> 06:49:25.040 align:start position:0%
virtual manufacturers and so forth there
 
06:49:26.628 --> 06:49:26.638 align:start position:0%
was no breakout
 
06:49:28.390 --> 06:49:28.400 align:start position:0%
by energy
 
06:49:30.868 --> 06:49:30.878 align:start position:0%
which one was which
 
06:49:32.628 --> 06:49:32.638 align:start position:0%
after going to new hampshire department
 
06:49:34.150 --> 06:49:34.160 align:start position:0%
of medicaid
 
06:49:36.390 --> 06:49:36.400 align:start position:0%
we were able to get a cleaner list of
 
06:49:38.708 --> 06:49:38.718 align:start position:0%
actual manufacturers which once we took
 
06:49:42.150 --> 06:49:42.160 align:start position:0%
care of the duplicates was less than 500
 
06:49:44.548 --> 06:49:44.558 align:start position:0%
there's probably another 100 or maybe
 
06:49:47.110 --> 06:49:47.120 align:start position:0%
less of wholesalers so the total that
 
06:49:49.910 --> 06:49:49.920 align:start position:0%
we're looking for is probably 600.
 
06:49:51.510 --> 06:49:51.520 align:start position:0%
so the number we're looking for which
 
06:49:53.750 --> 06:49:53.760 align:start position:0%
went the fiscal committee was 300
 
06:49:58.468 --> 06:49:58.478 align:start position:0%
000 350 000 not 850 000 to 1.8 1.2
 
06:49:58.478 --> 06:50:00.948 align:start position:0%
000 350 000 not 850 000 to 1.8 1.2
million

06:50:00.948 --> 06:50:00.958 align:start position:0%
million
 
06:50:04.468 --> 06:50:04.478 align:start position:0%
to give you a feel for how this is so
 
06:50:04.478 --> 06:50:07.110 align:start position:0%
to give you a feel for how this is so
non-transparent

06:50:07.110 --> 06:50:07.120 align:start position:0%
non-transparent
 
06:50:08.548 --> 06:50:08.558 align:start position:0%
in january
 
06:50:10.070 --> 06:50:10.080 align:start position:0%
of this year
 
06:50:12.230 --> 06:50:12.240 align:start position:0%
the attorney general's office settled
 
06:50:15.750 --> 06:50:15.760 align:start position:0%
with santeen which is a pbm
 
06:50:18.788 --> 06:50:18.798 align:start position:0%
which operates our medicaid managed care
 
06:50:18.798 --> 06:50:20.548 align:start position:0%
which operates our medicaid managed care
organization

06:50:20.548 --> 06:50:20.558 align:start position:0%
organization
 
06:50:22.230 --> 06:50:22.240 align:start position:0%
do you have any clue what they settled
 
06:50:22.240 --> 06:50:23.510 align:start position:0%
do you have any clue what they settled
for

06:50:23.510 --> 06:50:23.520 align:start position:0%
for
 
06:50:26.310 --> 06:50:26.320 align:start position:0%
21 million dollars
 
06:50:29.910 --> 06:50:29.920 align:start position:0%
in 2021 the same company settled with
 
06:50:33.110 --> 06:50:33.120 align:start position:0%
ohio for over 88 million
 
06:50:36.150 --> 06:50:36.160 align:start position:0%
where's the money going folks
 
06:50:36.160 --> 06:50:37.190 align:start position:0%
where's the money going folks
as

06:50:37.190 --> 06:50:37.200 align:start position:0%
as
 
06:50:38.468 --> 06:50:38.478 align:start position:0%
senator sherman said and also
 
06:50:40.468 --> 06:50:40.478 align:start position:0%
synchronous march said
 
06:50:42.150 --> 06:50:42.160 align:start position:0%
governor sununu released a statement
 
06:50:43.990 --> 06:50:44.000 align:start position:0%
after the past the senate
 
06:50:46.628 --> 06:50:46.638 align:start position:0%
that this is probably one of the ways to
 
06:50:49.270 --> 06:50:49.280 align:start position:0%
bring greater accountability and greater
 
06:50:51.990 --> 06:50:52.000 align:start position:0%
transparency to an opaque system
 
06:50:54.390 --> 06:50:54.400 align:start position:0%
to help the state fundamentally be sure
 
06:50:56.628 --> 06:50:56.638 align:start position:0%
it's getting as much of its savings as
 
06:50:59.430 --> 06:50:59.440 align:start position:0%
it possibly can
 
06:51:02.150 --> 06:51:02.160 align:start position:0%
if we don't know how it works
 
06:51:04.230 --> 06:51:04.240 align:start position:0%
we don't understand the mechanism the
 
06:51:05.750 --> 06:51:05.760 align:start position:0%
levers behind it
 
06:51:08.948 --> 06:51:08.958 align:start position:0%
how is the state going to maximize its
 
06:51:12.390 --> 06:51:12.400 align:start position:0%
opportunity to save money
 
06:51:14.628 --> 06:51:14.638 align:start position:0%
be without that information
 
06:51:16.548 --> 06:51:16.558 align:start position:0%
that's just the state itself but think
 
06:51:18.150 --> 06:51:18.160 align:start position:0%
about it this way too
 
06:51:20.628 --> 06:51:20.638 align:start position:0%
we're all policy makers
 
06:51:22.468 --> 06:51:22.478 align:start position:0%
don't we want to have accurate
 
06:51:24.868 --> 06:51:24.878 align:start position:0%
information before us
 
06:51:27.830 --> 06:51:27.840 align:start position:0%
to make correct policy decisions
 
06:51:29.590 --> 06:51:29.600 align:start position:0%
without the information without that
 
06:51:33.990 --> 06:51:34.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:51:36.230 --> 06:51:36.240 align:start position:0%
so i leave you with this
 
06:51:37.910 --> 06:51:37.920 align:start position:0%
the journey from a manufacturer to the
 
06:51:41.190 --> 06:51:41.200 align:start position:0%
patient passes through many entities
 
06:51:42.948 --> 06:51:42.958 align:start position:0%
by a complicated
 
06:51:45.510 --> 06:51:45.520 align:start position:0%
complex non-transparent path
 
06:51:47.670 --> 06:51:47.680 align:start position:0%
often to the detriment of the patient
 
06:51:49.510 --> 06:51:49.520 align:start position:0%
and the public payers
 
06:51:51.110 --> 06:51:51.120 align:start position:0%
our primary goal of the prescription
 
06:51:53.030 --> 06:51:53.040 align:start position:0%
drug affordability board is to bring
 
06:51:54.948 --> 06:51:54.958 align:start position:0%
greater transparency
 
06:51:56.628 --> 06:51:56.638 align:start position:0%
on the pricing of prescription drugs to
 
06:51:56.638 --> 06:51:57.510 align:start position:0%
on the pricing of prescription drugs to
ensure

question
 
06:52:22.628 --> 06:52:22.638 align:start position:0%
my question regards this chart that you
 
06:52:23.910 --> 06:52:23.920 align:start position:0%
handed out
 
06:52:27.270 --> 06:52:27.280 align:start position:0%
am i correct that this is uh the slide
 
06:52:28.868 --> 06:52:28.878 align:start position:0%
that we used at the prescription drug
 
06:52:30.548 --> 06:52:30.558 align:start position:0%
affordability board to describe the
 
06:52:30.558 --> 06:52:32.548 align:start position:0%
affordability board to describe the
pharmaceutical

06:52:32.548 --> 06:52:32.558 align:start position:0%
pharmaceutical
 
06:52:34.468 --> 06:52:34.478 align:start position:0%
supply chain as representative grota
 
06:52:36.310 --> 06:52:36.320 align:start position:0%
asked earlier and that we spent several
 
06:52:38.150 --> 06:52:38.160 align:start position:0%
hours trying to understand this
 
06:52:40.070 --> 06:52:40.080 align:start position:0%
particular supply chain at the
 
06:52:42.230 --> 06:52:42.240 align:start position:0%
prescription drug affordability board
 
06:52:43.830 --> 06:52:43.840 align:start position:0%
representative marsh that is actually
 
06:52:46.468 --> 06:52:46.478 align:start position:0%
right this is the chart we reviewed it's
 
06:52:49.190 --> 06:52:49.200 align:start position:0%
the chart i spent 30 years of my life
 
06:52:51.270 --> 06:52:51.280 align:start position:0%
trying to understand and quite frankly i
 
06:52:53.110 --> 06:52:53.120 align:start position:0%
think i've got it but i'm totally
 
06:52:54.548 --> 06:52:54.558 align:start position:0%
telling you now i don't think i totally
 
06:52:56.548 --> 06:52:56.558 align:start position:0%
understand it that's after 30 years of
 
06:52:58.150 --> 06:52:58.160 align:start position:0%
looking at it
 
06:53:02.230 --> 06:53:02.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:53:02.240 --> 06:53:03.910 align:start position:0%
 
questions

06:53:21.430 --> 06:53:21.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:53:24.310 --> 06:53:24.320 align:start position:0%

today to
 
06:53:36.070 --> 06:53:36.080 align:start position:0%
to be a subject matter expert you've
 
06:53:39.110 --> 06:53:39.120 align:start position:0%
heard a lot of testimony from people who
 
06:53:41.910 --> 06:53:41.920 align:start position:0%
uh know this subject a lot better than i
 
06:53:41.920 --> 06:53:42.708 align:start position:0%
uh know this subject a lot better than i
have

06:53:42.708 --> 06:53:42.718 align:start position:0%
have
 
06:53:45.270 --> 06:53:45.280 align:start position:0%
so so what am i going to do i'm going to
 
06:53:46.390 --> 06:53:46.400 align:start position:0%
tell you
 
06:53:48.390 --> 06:53:48.400 align:start position:0%
my experience with
 
06:53:50.708 --> 06:53:50.718 align:start position:0%
this affordability board and sort of my
 
06:53:53.350 --> 06:53:53.360 align:start position:0%
reactions to it and hope that in some
 
06:53:55.830 --> 06:53:55.840 align:start position:0%
way you can relate to my kind of
 
06:53:57.590 --> 06:53:57.600 align:start position:0%
human experience
 
06:53:59.590 --> 06:53:59.600 align:start position:0%
i'm a member of the joint fiscal
 
06:53:59.600 --> 06:54:01.190 align:start position:0%
i'm a member of the joint fiscal
committee

06:54:01.190 --> 06:54:01.200 align:start position:0%
committee
 
06:54:03.670 --> 06:54:03.680 align:start position:0%
and it is in our most recent fiscal
 
06:54:05.910 --> 06:54:05.920 align:start position:0%
committee meeting that we
 
06:54:07.990 --> 06:54:08.000 align:start position:0%
saw a proposal
 
06:54:08.000 --> 06:54:08.868 align:start position:0%
saw a proposal
to

06:54:08.868 --> 06:54:08.878 align:start position:0%
to
 
06:54:12.390 --> 06:54:12.400 align:start position:0%
authorize transfers of funds so that the
 
06:54:15.030 --> 06:54:15.040 align:start position:0%
affordability board could have i believe
 
06:54:18.468 --> 06:54:18.478 align:start position:0%
it was 350 000
 
06:54:18.478 --> 06:54:19.350 align:start position:0%
it was 350 000
and

06:54:19.350 --> 06:54:19.360 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:54:22.948 --> 06:54:22.958 align:start position:0%
during that presentation the dhhs
 
06:54:24.948 --> 06:54:24.958 align:start position:0%
individual who was
 
06:54:27.670 --> 06:54:27.680 align:start position:0%
presenting the the proposal
 
06:54:29.510 --> 06:54:29.520 align:start position:0%
actually knew very little about the
 
06:54:31.510 --> 06:54:31.520 align:start position:0%
proposal and
 
06:54:33.270 --> 06:54:33.280 align:start position:0%
is going to come back with additional
 
06:54:33.280 --> 06:54:34.788 align:start position:0%
is going to come back with additional
information

06:54:34.788 --> 06:54:34.798 align:start position:0%
information
 
06:54:36.548 --> 06:54:36.558 align:start position:0%
but the things that just jumped out to
 
06:54:39.750 --> 06:54:39.760 align:start position:0%
me was getting the affordability board
 
06:54:39.760 --> 06:54:41.350 align:start position:0%
me was getting the affordability board
going

06:54:41.350 --> 06:54:41.360 align:start position:0%
going
 
06:54:44.390 --> 06:54:44.400 align:start position:0%
it was they were not at all clear on
 
06:54:47.510 --> 06:54:47.520 align:start position:0%
what their cash flow situation was going
 
06:54:48.788 --> 06:54:48.798 align:start position:0%
to be
 
06:54:48.798 --> 06:54:50.150 align:start position:0%
to be
and

06:54:50.150 --> 06:54:50.160 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:54:52.310 --> 06:54:52.320 align:start position:0%
and to me as a person who's managed
 
06:54:54.948 --> 06:54:54.958 align:start position:0%
operations i think understanding your
 
06:54:57.110 --> 06:54:57.120 align:start position:0%
cash flow is a good indication of
 
06:54:59.910 --> 06:54:59.920 align:start position:0%
understanding what you're doing and they
 
06:54:59.920 --> 06:55:01.030 align:start position:0%
understanding what you're doing and they
the

06:55:01.030 --> 06:55:01.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:55:03.830 --> 06:55:03.840 align:start position:0%
the expert from dhhs could not explain
 
06:55:03.840 --> 06:55:04.708 align:start position:0%
the expert from dhhs could not explain
it

06:55:04.708 --> 06:55:04.718 align:start position:0%
it
 
06:55:04.718 --> 06:55:05.830 align:start position:0%
it
um

06:55:05.830 --> 06:55:05.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:55:07.510 --> 06:55:07.520 align:start position:0%
also um
 
06:55:07.520 --> 06:55:09.270 align:start position:0%
also um
the

06:55:09.270 --> 06:55:09.280 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:55:10.948 --> 06:55:10.958 align:start position:0%
they talked about
 
06:55:14.468 --> 06:55:14.478 align:start position:0%
needing to hire an executive director
 
06:55:16.548 --> 06:55:16.558 align:start position:0%
but it wasn't clear what that process
 
06:55:18.070 --> 06:55:18.080 align:start position:0%
would be like
 
06:55:19.990 --> 06:55:20.000 align:start position:0%
they wanted to make sure they could
 
06:55:23.510 --> 06:55:23.520 align:start position:0%
start collecting fees
 
06:55:26.390 --> 06:55:26.400 align:start position:0%
and if you're a person paying a fee
 
06:55:28.788 --> 06:55:28.798 align:start position:0%
it feels like a tax
 
06:55:32.310 --> 06:55:32.320 align:start position:0%
so the semantics around fees are not
 
06:55:32.320 --> 06:55:33.590 align:start position:0%
so the semantics around fees are not
taxes

06:55:33.590 --> 06:55:33.600 align:start position:0%
taxes
 
06:55:36.310 --> 06:55:36.320 align:start position:0%
and that fees represent no cost to the
 
06:55:36.320 --> 06:55:37.590 align:start position:0%
and that fees represent no cost to the
government

06:55:37.590 --> 06:55:37.600 align:start position:0%
government
 
06:55:40.948 --> 06:55:40.958 align:start position:0%
uh i i hope i hope we understand what's
 
06:55:43.750 --> 06:55:43.760 align:start position:0%
really going on when you collect a new
 
06:55:46.708 --> 06:55:46.718 align:start position:0%
fee to the business that's paying the
 
06:55:46.718 --> 06:55:47.590 align:start position:0%
fee to the business that's paying the
fee

06:55:47.590 --> 06:55:47.600 align:start position:0%
fee
 
06:55:50.948 --> 06:55:50.958 align:start position:0%
that feels like a tax
 
06:55:52.070 --> 06:55:52.080 align:start position:0%
and those
 
06:55:52.080 --> 06:55:53.350 align:start position:0%
and those
taxes

06:55:53.350 --> 06:55:53.360 align:start position:0%
taxes
 
06:55:55.830 --> 06:55:55.840 align:start position:0%
would be fees i'll stick to the official
 
06:55:58.230 --> 06:55:58.240 align:start position:0%
word because i think the point is clear
 
06:55:59.990 --> 06:56:00.000 align:start position:0%
that there's very little real
 
06:56:02.150 --> 06:56:02.160 align:start position:0%
distinction of of
 
06:56:04.070 --> 06:56:04.080 align:start position:0%
importance between a fee and a tax but
 
06:56:08.310 --> 06:56:08.320 align:start position:0%
it's a fee um i would say that um those
 
06:56:12.390 --> 06:56:12.400 align:start position:0%
fees are coming from the industry
 
06:56:15.830 --> 06:56:15.840 align:start position:0%
from which this affordability board
 
06:56:18.468 --> 06:56:18.478 align:start position:0%
wants to find ways
 
06:56:21.590 --> 06:56:21.600 align:start position:0%
to reduce their prices
 
06:56:21.600 --> 06:56:22.868 align:start position:0%
to reduce their prices
and

06:56:22.868 --> 06:56:22.878 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:56:25.670 --> 06:56:25.680 align:start position:0%
i just think as a common sense sort of
 
06:56:25.680 --> 06:56:26.708 align:start position:0%
i just think as a common sense sort of
thing

06:56:26.708 --> 06:56:26.718 align:start position:0%
thing
 
06:56:31.270 --> 06:56:31.280 align:start position:0%
you don't initiate an increase in
 
06:56:33.670 --> 06:56:33.680 align:start position:0%
supplier's price structure
 
06:56:35.990 --> 06:56:36.000 align:start position:0%
and then say good now you can reduce
 
06:56:38.788 --> 06:56:38.798 align:start position:0%
your prices if you increase their costs
 
06:56:41.110 --> 06:56:41.120 align:start position:0%
you're increasing their prices that's
 
06:56:43.430 --> 06:56:43.440 align:start position:0%
the way things work
 
06:56:46.548 --> 06:56:46.558 align:start position:0%
and so we've heard today a bunch of
 
06:56:49.590 --> 06:56:49.600 align:start position:0%
potential benefits
 
06:56:52.788 --> 06:56:52.798 align:start position:0%
to the state to include reduction of
 
06:56:54.788 --> 06:56:54.798 align:start position:0%
property taxes
 
06:56:57.430 --> 06:56:57.440 align:start position:0%
okay so i would just simply say
 
06:56:59.350 --> 06:56:59.360 align:start position:0%
that the benefits
 
06:57:00.948 --> 06:57:00.958 align:start position:0%
that are being
 
06:57:00.958 --> 06:57:02.310 align:start position:0%
that are being
promised

06:57:02.310 --> 06:57:02.320 align:start position:0%
promised
 
06:57:04.390 --> 06:57:04.400 align:start position:0%
are theoretical
 
06:57:08.468 --> 06:57:08.478 align:start position:0%
and what we know is real is they want to
 
06:57:08.478 --> 06:57:09.510 align:start position:0%
and what we know is real is they want to
add

06:57:09.510 --> 06:57:09.520 align:start position:0%
add
 
06:57:12.310 --> 06:57:12.320 align:start position:0%
to our supply system
 
06:57:15.430 --> 06:57:15.440 align:start position:0%
at least a 350 000 a year
 
06:57:18.628 --> 06:57:18.638 align:start position:0%
set attack fees excuse me
 
06:57:21.190 --> 06:57:21.200 align:start position:0%
so uh let's go to some other good
 
06:57:23.510 --> 06:57:23.520 align:start position:0%
government principles
 
06:57:25.750 --> 06:57:25.760 align:start position:0%
the house did not
 
06:57:25.760 --> 06:57:26.788 align:start position:0%
the house did not
hear

06:57:26.788 --> 06:57:26.798 align:start position:0%
hear
 
06:57:29.110 --> 06:57:29.120 align:start position:0%
the details of this we didn't get a
 
06:57:30.948 --> 06:57:30.958 align:start position:0%
chance to work through it
 
06:57:32.708 --> 06:57:32.718 align:start position:0%
the other house
 
06:57:35.510 --> 06:57:35.520 align:start position:0%
did an omnibus bill
 
06:57:37.270 --> 06:57:37.280 align:start position:0%
i personally hate
 
06:57:39.590 --> 06:57:39.600 align:start position:0%
omnibus bills i think every bill needs
 
06:57:42.868 --> 06:57:42.878 align:start position:0%
to be looked at i think the other house

looks at us
 
06:57:44.958 --> 06:57:47.190 align:start position:0%
looks at us
as

06:57:47.190 --> 06:57:47.200 align:start position:0%
as
 
06:57:49.110 --> 06:57:49.120 align:start position:0%
the body that has
 
06:57:50.548 --> 06:57:50.558 align:start position:0%
more people
 
06:57:53.350 --> 06:57:53.360 align:start position:0%
and more time to do the deep dive on
 
06:57:55.590 --> 06:57:55.600 align:start position:0%
things and we've had
 
06:57:58.150 --> 06:57:58.160 align:start position:0%
a tremendous number of questions both in
 
06:58:00.390 --> 06:58:00.400 align:start position:0%
the joint fiscal committee and i'm as
 
06:58:01.910 --> 06:58:01.920 align:start position:0%
i'm hearing today
 
06:58:03.430 --> 06:58:03.440 align:start position:0%
um about
 
06:58:06.708 --> 06:58:06.718 align:start position:0%
um what the real impact of this bill uh
 
06:58:08.708 --> 06:58:08.718 align:start position:0%
this uh board would be
 
06:58:12.150 --> 06:58:12.160 align:start position:0%
i i would just point out that
 
06:58:15.110 --> 06:58:15.120 align:start position:0%
in law we have the
 
06:58:16.310 --> 06:58:16.320 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
06:58:17.990 --> 06:58:18.000 align:start position:0%

06:58:30.230 --> 06:58:30.240 align:start position:0%
optimize prescription drug savings
 
06:58:32.708 --> 06:58:32.718 align:start position:0%
by the state of new hampshire this is
 
06:58:34.948 --> 06:58:34.958 align:start position:0%
what we heard earlier from
 
06:58:37.110 --> 06:58:37.120 align:start position:0%
the representative from hudson
 
06:58:40.628 --> 06:58:40.638 align:start position:0%
that mr arlinghaus has already done
 
06:58:43.270 --> 06:58:43.280 align:start position:0%
some work in and has already produced a
 
06:58:43.280 --> 06:58:44.468 align:start position:0%
some work in and has already produced a
reverse

06:58:44.468 --> 06:58:44.478 align:start position:0%
reverse
 
06:58:44.478 --> 06:58:45.510 align:start position:0%

06:58:45.510 --> 06:58:45.520 align:start position:0%
auction
 
06:58:47.270 --> 06:58:47.280 align:start position:0%
please don't ask me what a reverse
 
06:58:50.230 --> 06:58:50.240 align:start position:0%
auction is i i'm not not prepared to
 
06:58:52.390 --> 06:58:52.400 align:start position:0%
answer that but it's one of the key
 
06:58:54.468 --> 06:58:54.478 align:start position:0%
tools also being used by the
 
06:58:56.230 --> 06:58:56.240 align:start position:0%
affordability bill
 
06:58:56.240 --> 06:58:57.030 align:start position:0%
affordability bill
so

06:58:57.030 --> 06:58:57.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:59:00.150 --> 06:59:00.160 align:start position:0%
there's a level of redundancy that i
 
06:59:00.160 --> 06:59:01.270 align:start position:0%
there's a level of redundancy that i
think

06:59:01.270 --> 06:59:01.280 align:start position:0%
think
 
06:59:04.708 --> 06:59:04.718 align:start position:0%
exists in the affordability bill
 
06:59:04.718 --> 06:59:05.510 align:start position:0%
exists in the affordability bill
that

06:59:05.510 --> 06:59:05.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:59:07.510 --> 06:59:07.520 align:start position:0%
affordability board
 
06:59:10.868 --> 06:59:10.878 align:start position:0%
bill that that i i think really deserves
 
06:59:12.628 --> 06:59:12.638 align:start position:0%
to have the house
 
06:59:14.868 --> 06:59:14.878 align:start position:0%
do a deep dive before we really
 
06:59:17.270 --> 06:59:17.280 align:start position:0%
authorize this thing to crank up
 
06:59:17.280 --> 06:59:18.310 align:start position:0%
authorize this thing to crank up
because

06:59:18.310 --> 06:59:18.320 align:start position:0%
because
 
06:59:20.628 --> 06:59:20.638 align:start position:0%
the general statement that we're going
 
06:59:22.548 --> 06:59:22.558 align:start position:0%
to grow government we're going to
 
06:59:24.310 --> 06:59:24.320 align:start position:0%
increase taxes
 
06:59:26.788 --> 06:59:26.798 align:start position:0%
and we're going to come up with nirvana
 
06:59:29.350 --> 06:59:29.360 align:start position:0%
at the other end of it just sounds to me
 
06:59:32.548 --> 06:59:32.558 align:start position:0%
to be a little optimistic
 
06:59:34.468 --> 06:59:34.478 align:start position:0%
it's also noteworthy that they're able
 
06:59:36.788 --> 06:59:36.798 align:start position:0%
to collect their fees
 
06:59:38.708 --> 06:59:38.718 align:start position:0%
and change their fees and waive their
 
06:59:38.718 --> 06:59:39.830 align:start position:0%
and change their fees and waive their
fees

06:59:39.830 --> 06:59:39.840 align:start position:0%
fees
 
06:59:42.708 --> 06:59:42.718 align:start position:0%
outside of the legislature and
 
06:59:44.310 --> 06:59:44.320 align:start position:0%
one of the things i think the
 
06:59:47.670 --> 06:59:47.680 align:start position:0%
legislature should guard jealously
 
06:59:47.680 --> 06:59:48.390 align:start position:0%
legislature should guard jealously
is

06:59:48.390 --> 06:59:48.400 align:start position:0%
is
 
06:59:51.190 --> 06:59:51.200 align:start position:0%
our ability to control the purse strings
 
06:59:53.510 --> 06:59:53.520 align:start position:0%
and so we've set up this board
 
06:59:57.510 --> 06:59:57.520 align:start position:0%
that can operate very autonomously
 
06:59:58.788 --> 06:59:58.798 align:start position:0%
with a lot of
 
06:59:58.798 --> 07:00:01.030 align:start position:0%
with a lot of
secrecy

07:00:01.030 --> 07:00:01.040 align:start position:0%
secrecy
 
07:00:03.910 --> 07:00:03.920 align:start position:0%
and it isn't really clear to me
 
07:00:07.030 --> 07:00:07.040 align:start position:0%
where we would get the accountability so
 
07:00:10.310 --> 07:00:10.320 align:start position:0%
uh i would suggest that um
 
07:00:13.430 --> 07:00:13.440 align:start position:0%
we go ahead and or you go ahead please
 
07:00:15.910 --> 07:00:15.920 align:start position:0%
uh let me correct that you go ahead and
 
07:00:17.990 --> 07:00:18.000 align:start position:0%
seriously consider
 
07:00:21.110 --> 07:00:21.120 align:start position:0%
representative lucas's amendment
 
07:00:25.590 --> 07:00:25.600 align:start position:0%
 
07:00:28.310 --> 07:00:28.320 align:start position:0%
this affordability board was was built
 
07:00:30.230 --> 07:00:30.240 align:start position:0%
in the darker night as far as the house
 
07:00:32.788 --> 07:00:32.798 align:start position:0%
was concerned and that we we really
 
07:00:34.788 --> 07:00:34.798 align:start position:0%
seriously need to take a deep dive on
 
07:00:36.948 --> 07:00:36.958 align:start position:0%
this and yes it's complicated
 
07:00:38.548 --> 07:00:38.558 align:start position:0%
i've heard several times that this is
 
07:00:41.510 --> 07:00:41.520 align:start position:0%
very complicated but so it just seems to
 
07:00:41.520 --> 07:00:42.390 align:start position:0%
very complicated but so it just seems to
me

07:00:42.390 --> 07:00:42.400 align:start position:0%
me
 
07:00:44.708 --> 07:00:44.718 align:start position:0%
all the more justification for us to
 
07:00:46.788 --> 07:00:46.798 align:start position:0%
step back take a deep breath and get it
 
07:00:48.310 --> 07:00:48.320 align:start position:0%
right so
 
07:00:50.708 --> 07:00:50.718 align:start position:0%
um i'll i'll answer questions if there
 
07:00:55.590 --> 07:00:55.600 align:start position:0%
 
07:00:57.670 --> 07:00:57.680 align:start position:0%
uh not seeing any thank you very much
 
07:01:00.708 --> 07:01:00.718 align:start position:0%
 
07:01:17.830 --> 07:01:17.840 align:start position:0%
 
07:01:19.590 --> 07:01:19.600 align:start position:0%

increase access to quality affordable
 
07:01:40.390 --> 07:01:40.400 align:start position:0%
i don't want to repeat too much of what
 
07:01:41.590 --> 07:01:41.600 align:start position:0%
has been said
 
07:01:43.750 --> 07:01:43.760 align:start position:0%

but i do want to stress new future
 
07:01:50.468 --> 07:01:50.478 align:start position:0%
strong strong strong opposition to this
 
07:01:50.478 --> 07:01:53.430 align:start position:0%
strong strong strong opposition to this
amendment

07:01:53.430 --> 07:01:53.440 align:start position:0%
 
07:01:55.830 --> 07:01:55.840 align:start position:0%
simply put we are in uh the rising cost
 
07:01:57.990 --> 07:01:58.000 align:start position:0%
of prescription drugs is nothing less
 
07:01:59.590 --> 07:01:59.600 align:start position:0%
than a public health crisis in this
 
07:02:02.390 --> 07:02:02.400 align:start position:0%
state and across the country and the
 
07:02:04.230 --> 07:02:04.240 align:start position:0%
affordability board is is an important
 
07:02:05.590 --> 07:02:05.600 align:start position:0%
tool to help bring increased
 
07:02:07.190 --> 07:02:07.200 align:start position:0%
transparency transparency and
 
07:02:07.200 --> 07:02:08.948 align:start position:0%
transparency transparency and
accountability

07:02:08.948 --> 07:02:08.958 align:start position:0%
accountability
 
07:02:13.030 --> 07:02:13.040 align:start position:0%
to these uh to the rising cost of drugs
 
07:02:16.390 --> 07:02:16.400 align:start position:0%
in the last few years alone we have seen
 
07:02:18.070 --> 07:02:18.080 align:start position:0%
we have seen the cost of insulin rise
 
07:02:19.590 --> 07:02:19.600 align:start position:0%
more than 50 percent we have seen the
 
07:02:21.110 --> 07:02:21.120 align:start position:0%
cost of
 
07:02:23.430 --> 07:02:23.440 align:start position:0%
narcan rise more than 400 percent in the
 
07:02:25.830 --> 07:02:25.840 align:start position:0%
midst of an ongoing addiction crisis i
 
07:02:27.990 --> 07:02:28.000 align:start position:0%
should note we have seen epipen rise
 
07:02:30.390 --> 07:02:30.400 align:start position:0%
more than 400 percent we have seen all
 
07:02:32.868 --> 07:02:32.878 align:start position:0%
across the board uh the average cost of
 
07:02:34.548 --> 07:02:34.558 align:start position:0%
prescription drugs has gone up more than
 
07:02:37.270 --> 07:02:37.280 align:start position:0%
five times the the rate of inflation uh
 
07:02:39.110 --> 07:02:39.120 align:start position:0%
these are costs that hit new hampshire
 
07:02:40.628 --> 07:02:40.638 align:start position:0%
families hard we have see you know these
 
07:02:42.708 --> 07:02:42.718 align:start position:0%
are our decreasing access to these
 
07:02:44.548 --> 07:02:44.558 align:start position:0%
life-saving treatments we are seeing
 
07:02:46.150 --> 07:02:46.160 align:start position:0%
patients having to
 
07:02:47.990 --> 07:02:48.000 align:start position:0%
uh having to forego treatment or having
 
07:02:49.990 --> 07:02:50.000 align:start position:0%
to ration their medications
 
07:02:52.390 --> 07:02:52.400 align:start position:0%
these are making people less healthy
 
07:02:52.400 --> 07:02:53.670 align:start position:0%
these are making people less healthy
people

07:02:53.670 --> 07:02:53.680 align:start position:0%
people
 
07:02:55.350 --> 07:02:55.360 align:start position:0%
and you know when the people have to
 
07:02:58.070 --> 07:02:58.080 align:start position:0%
ration or or not uh not you not take
 
07:03:00.070 --> 07:03:00.080 align:start position:0%
their medications as prescribed they end
 
07:03:01.750 --> 07:03:01.760 align:start position:0%
up in the hospital in emergency rooms
 
07:03:03.750 --> 07:03:03.760 align:start position:0%
this increase the cost of uncompensated
 
07:03:05.030 --> 07:03:05.040 align:start position:0%
care which
 
07:03:07.110 --> 07:03:07.120 align:start position:0%
comes back down to
 
07:03:08.628 --> 07:03:08.638 align:start position:0%
to all of us healthcare consumers in
 
07:03:09.990 --> 07:03:10.000 align:start position:0%
terms of higher premiums and other
 
07:03:12.628 --> 07:03:12.638 align:start position:0%
healthcare costs
 
07:03:14.070 --> 07:03:14.080 align:start position:0%
again i would stress that this
 
07:03:15.350 --> 07:03:15.360 align:start position:0%
affordability board is a really
 
07:03:17.670 --> 07:03:17.680 align:start position:0%
important tool to just bring to light
 
07:03:19.830 --> 07:03:19.840 align:start position:0%
more about what this process looks like
 
07:03:22.390 --> 07:03:22.400 align:start position:0%
why these costs are going up so high
 
07:03:23.990 --> 07:03:24.000 align:start position:0%
and and maybe can begin to come up with
 
07:03:25.510 --> 07:03:25.520 align:start position:0%
some recommendations about how we can
 
07:03:27.430 --> 07:03:27.440 align:start position:0%
better address them and bring bring this
 
07:03:30.548 --> 07:03:30.558 align:start position:0%
needed relief to new hampshire families
 
07:03:32.788 --> 07:03:32.798 align:start position:0%
given all the uh all the public health
 
07:03:35.030 --> 07:03:35.040 align:start position:0%
concerns we are facing uh at this time
 
07:03:37.110 --> 07:03:37.120 align:start position:0%
i'm frankly i'm a little surprised that
 
07:03:38.150 --> 07:03:38.160 align:start position:0%
we are
 
07:03:39.990 --> 07:03:40.000 align:start position:0%
that we are considering this this is an
 
07:03:41.350 --> 07:03:41.360 align:start position:0%
important tool we should support it and
 
07:03:43.030 --> 07:03:43.040 align:start position:0%
keep it in place and allow it to do its
 
07:03:44.628 --> 07:03:44.638 align:start position:0%
work and with that i'm happy to take
 
07:03:44.638 --> 07:03:46.708 align:start position:0%
work and with that i'm happy to take
questions

07:03:46.708 --> 07:03:46.718 align:start position:0%
questions
 
07:03:48.868 --> 07:03:48.878 align:start position:0%
thank you mr mr berry are there
 
07:03:49.910 --> 07:03:49.920 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
07:03:52.468 --> 07:03:52.478 align:start position:0%
representative grota
 
07:03:54.948 --> 07:03:54.958 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair mr berry um how
 
07:03:56.948 --> 07:03:56.958 align:start position:0%
does this board
 
07:03:59.750 --> 07:03:59.760 align:start position:0%
we've we've heard that
 
07:04:01.750 --> 07:04:01.760 align:start position:0%
das is already doing this and the
 
07:04:03.350 --> 07:04:03.360 align:start position:0%
department of health and human services
 
07:04:05.430 --> 07:04:05.440 align:start position:0%
is already doing this how does in your
 
07:04:07.350 --> 07:04:07.360 align:start position:0%
view how does this differ from what's
 
07:04:09.590 --> 07:04:09.600 align:start position:0%
already being done in the state sure
 
07:04:10.390 --> 07:04:10.400 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
07:04:11.830 --> 07:04:11.840 align:start position:0%
representative and certainly there are
 
07:04:13.510 --> 07:04:13.520 align:start position:0%
others in the room who have spent more
 
07:04:14.708 --> 07:04:14.718 align:start position:0%
time with the board and can talk a
 
07:04:16.150 --> 07:04:16.160 align:start position:0%
little more about the mechanics than i
 
07:04:18.628 --> 07:04:18.638 align:start position:0%
can but you know i think that the data
 
07:04:20.390 --> 07:04:20.400 align:start position:0%
collection the research that they are
 
07:04:22.230 --> 07:04:22.240 align:start position:0%
that this board is able to conduct with
 
07:04:24.468 --> 07:04:24.478 align:start position:0%
the uh you know with the backing of the
 
07:04:26.830 --> 07:04:26.840 align:start position:0%
state is just i think it
 
07:04:29.510 --> 07:04:29.520 align:start position:0%
um uh uh you know it outweighs the you
 
07:04:31.350 --> 07:04:31.360 align:start position:0%
know what we're able to do elsewhere i
 
07:04:33.910 --> 07:04:33.920 align:start position:0%
think that the board is uh you know this
 
07:04:36.468 --> 07:04:36.478 align:start position:0%
stat it is made up of uh professionals
 
07:04:39.350 --> 07:04:39.360 align:start position:0%
and export experts in this area um i
 
07:04:41.190 --> 07:04:41.200 align:start position:0%
ideally you know
 
07:04:42.390 --> 07:04:42.400 align:start position:0%
based on the underlying bill you're
 
07:04:44.150 --> 07:04:44.160 align:start position:0%
considering it would have staff in place
 
07:04:46.150 --> 07:04:46.160 align:start position:0%
to be able to uh to do this research
 
07:04:48.230 --> 07:04:48.240 align:start position:0%
collect this data and bring shine more
 
07:04:50.468 --> 07:04:50.478 align:start position:0%
light on uh sort of the the the
 
07:04:52.310 --> 07:04:52.320 align:start position:0%
practices and the approaches that
 
07:04:55.030 --> 07:04:55.040 align:start position:0%
pharmaceutical companies are taking
 
07:04:57.510 --> 07:04:57.520 align:start position:0%
so uh you know i i think it really is uh
 
07:04:59.270 --> 07:04:59.280 align:start position:0%
you know an important an important tool
 
07:05:01.830 --> 07:05:01.840 align:start position:0%
for all of us and and uh um yeah i i
 
07:05:03.270 --> 07:05:03.280 align:start position:0%
think that we the more tools we have in
 
07:05:07.830 --> 07:05:07.840 align:start position:0%
 
07:05:09.190 --> 07:05:09.200 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
07:05:12.708 --> 07:05:12.718 align:start position:0%
 
07:05:14.708 --> 07:05:14.718 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you mr berry
 
07:05:36.070 --> 07:05:36.080 align:start position:0%
 
07:05:37.670 --> 07:05:37.680 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair members of the
 
07:05:39.590 --> 07:05:39.600 align:start position:0%

mike padmar i'm the director of advocacy
 
07:05:43.910 --> 07:05:43.920 align:start position:0%
for the new hampshire medical society
 
07:05:45.670 --> 07:05:45.680 align:start position:0%
um i'll be relatively brief because i
 
07:05:46.948 --> 07:05:46.958 align:start position:0%
think that a number of the folks who
 
07:05:48.628 --> 07:05:48.638 align:start position:0%
have testified before me including mr
 
07:05:49.750 --> 07:05:49.760 align:start position:0%
berry have touched on a lot of the
 
07:05:51.510 --> 07:05:51.520 align:start position:0%
things that i want to implore to all of
 
07:05:53.270 --> 07:05:53.280 align:start position:0%
you today but but i'm here today to
 
07:05:55.110 --> 07:05:55.120 align:start position:0%
speak in opposition uh to the
 
07:05:57.510 --> 07:05:57.520 align:start position:0%
non-jermaine amendment zero three seven
 
07:06:02.070 --> 07:06:02.080 align:start position:0%
five h to hb one five six six fn uh two
 
07:06:03.350 --> 07:06:03.360 align:start position:0%
years ago the new hampshire medical
 
07:06:06.230 --> 07:06:06.240 align:start position:0%
society we joined a bipartisan group of
 
07:06:08.868 --> 07:06:08.878 align:start position:0%
lawmakers and statewide stakeholders to
 
07:06:08.878 --> 07:06:09.670 align:start position:0%
lawmakers and statewide stakeholders to
pass

07:06:09.670 --> 07:06:09.680 align:start position:0%
pass
 
07:06:12.628 --> 07:06:12.638 align:start position:0%
hb 1280 that enacted this prescription
 
07:06:15.510 --> 07:06:15.520 align:start position:0%
drug affordability board
 
07:06:17.990 --> 07:06:18.000 align:start position:0%
we represent physicians
 
07:06:19.430 --> 07:06:19.440 align:start position:0%
across the board this is something that
 
07:06:21.030 --> 07:06:21.040 align:start position:0%
i spoke with them about
 
07:06:22.468 --> 07:06:22.478 align:start position:0%
in when we were working on this bill a
 
07:06:24.708 --> 07:06:24.718 align:start position:0%
few years ago and just across the board
 
07:06:26.628 --> 07:06:26.638 align:start position:0%
this was something that our physicians
 
07:06:28.390 --> 07:06:28.400 align:start position:0%
saw a need to have
 
07:06:31.030 --> 07:06:31.040 align:start position:0%
a dedicated body to to look into this
 
07:06:32.628 --> 07:06:32.638 align:start position:0%
from their perspective they don't see
 
07:06:35.270 --> 07:06:35.280 align:start position:0%
this work being done
 
07:06:36.628 --> 07:06:36.638 align:start position:0%
a number of things have been listed
 
07:06:38.788 --> 07:06:38.798 align:start position:0%
today of other entities that are trying
 
07:06:40.788 --> 07:06:40.798 align:start position:0%
to accomplish what this board is doing
 
07:06:43.110 --> 07:06:43.120 align:start position:0%
and frankly
 
07:06:45.990 --> 07:06:46.000 align:start position:0%
from their perspective they haven't seen
 
07:06:47.510 --> 07:06:47.520 align:start position:0%
the results of that
 
07:06:51.190 --> 07:06:51.200 align:start position:0%
so this board what it's attempting to do
 
07:06:51.200 --> 07:06:52.868 align:start position:0%
so this board what it's attempting to do
um

07:06:52.868 --> 07:06:52.878 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:06:54.628 --> 07:06:54.638 align:start position:0%
our health care providers want this work
 
07:06:56.948 --> 07:06:56.958 align:start position:0%
to be done our patients their patients
 
07:06:59.430 --> 07:06:59.440 align:start position:0%
want this work to be done don't don't
 
07:07:02.708 --> 07:07:02.718 align:start position:0%
stop this body this board from trying to
 
07:07:05.430 --> 07:07:05.440 align:start position:0%
accomplish this goal which i think from
 
07:07:07.350 --> 07:07:07.360 align:start position:0%
the folks who have spoken before me have
 
07:07:08.788 --> 07:07:08.798 align:start position:0%
outlined just a number of things that
 
07:07:10.548 --> 07:07:10.558 align:start position:0%
would benefit our state
 
07:07:12.708 --> 07:07:12.718 align:start position:0%
and the patients that live here
 
07:07:14.628 --> 07:07:14.638 align:start position:0%
so with that i thank you all for your
 
07:07:17.990 --> 07:07:18.000 align:start position:0%
time and i'm happy to take any questions
 
07:07:19.430 --> 07:07:19.440 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any questions
 
07:07:21.670 --> 07:07:21.680 align:start position:0%
representative scitec
 
07:07:23.590 --> 07:07:23.600 align:start position:0%
how do we measure the effectiveness and
 
07:07:28.030 --> 07:07:28.040 align:start position:0%
 
07:07:30.390 --> 07:07:30.400 align:start position:0%
board i
 
07:07:32.390 --> 07:07:32.400 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question uh
 
07:07:35.270 --> 07:07:35.280 align:start position:0%
to be honest sir uh i i'm i'm not
 
07:07:37.670 --> 07:07:37.680 align:start position:0%
certain other than we're going to uh
 
07:07:39.110 --> 07:07:39.120 align:start position:0%
look at the goals that they have
 
07:07:42.310 --> 07:07:42.320 align:start position:0%
outlined in it and i think that as we
 
07:07:44.788 --> 07:07:44.798 align:start position:0%
as the board is able to do their work
 
07:07:48.310 --> 07:07:48.320 align:start position:0%
i think that those results will be known
 
07:07:50.070 --> 07:07:50.080 align:start position:0%
we'll we'll see
 
07:07:51.270 --> 07:07:51.280 align:start position:0%
whether or not
 
07:07:53.110 --> 07:07:53.120 align:start position:0%
there is further transparency what what
 
07:07:55.750 --> 07:07:55.760 align:start position:0%
some of our patients are are able to
 
07:07:58.070 --> 07:07:58.080 align:start position:0%
um if they're able to utilize some of
 
07:07:59.430 --> 07:07:59.440 align:start position:0%
these different things
 
07:08:02.788 --> 07:08:02.798 align:start position:0%
but i think that the the the intent of
 
07:08:03.990 --> 07:08:04.000 align:start position:0%
this board
 
07:08:05.910 --> 07:08:05.920 align:start position:0%
is good
 
07:08:08.230 --> 07:08:08.240 align:start position:0%
and i think that we have seen support
 
07:08:10.948 --> 07:08:10.958 align:start position:0%
through uh the committee process two
 
07:08:12.948 --> 07:08:12.958 align:start position:0%
years ago of stakeholders coming
 
07:08:14.628 --> 07:08:14.638 align:start position:0%
including the governor
 
07:08:17.270 --> 07:08:17.280 align:start position:0%
stating their support for the intent
 
07:08:19.110 --> 07:08:19.120 align:start position:0%
of what this bill will do
 
07:08:21.510 --> 07:08:21.520 align:start position:0%
you're talking about the results
 
07:08:23.350 --> 07:08:23.360 align:start position:0%
we may not know those results for a bit
 
07:08:23.360 --> 07:08:24.468 align:start position:0%
we may not know those results for a bit
but

07:08:24.468 --> 07:08:24.478 align:start position:0%
but
 
07:08:26.868 --> 07:08:26.878 align:start position:0%
but i think that if the goals are are
 
07:08:29.350 --> 07:08:29.360 align:start position:0%
good and if the goals are smart then we
 
07:08:31.030 --> 07:08:31.040 align:start position:0%
should give this board an opportunity to
 
07:08:35.110 --> 07:08:35.120 align:start position:0%
 
07:08:37.670 --> 07:08:37.680 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
07:08:39.110 --> 07:08:39.120 align:start position:0%
yes representative groat and then
 
07:08:42.070 --> 07:08:42.080 align:start position:0%
marshall thank you madam chair where
 
07:08:44.230 --> 07:08:44.240 align:start position:0%
would the
 
07:08:46.548 --> 07:08:46.558 align:start position:0%
reports of
 
07:08:48.070 --> 07:08:48.080 align:start position:0%
meetings and
 
07:08:51.030 --> 07:08:51.040 align:start position:0%
of this board be found
 
07:08:52.628 --> 07:08:52.638 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry did you say where would they
 
07:08:52.638 --> 07:08:54.150 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry did you say where would they
be

07:08:54.150 --> 07:08:54.160 align:start position:0%
be
 
07:08:55.750 --> 07:08:55.760 align:start position:0%
i don't know if i can specifically
 
07:08:57.830 --> 07:08:57.840 align:start position:0%
answer that question but i i believe
 
07:08:59.670 --> 07:08:59.680 align:start position:0%
that one of the folks who testified i
 
07:09:00.868 --> 07:09:00.878 align:start position:0%
believe it was senator sherman may have
 
07:09:02.468 --> 07:09:02.478 align:start position:0%
addressed that question but i i'm not
 
07:09:04.070 --> 07:09:04.080 align:start position:0%
certain but i i can certainly check with
 
07:09:05.430 --> 07:09:05.440 align:start position:0%
senator sherman and i can certainly
 
07:09:07.110 --> 07:09:07.120 align:start position:0%
check with
 
07:09:08.788 --> 07:09:08.798 align:start position:0%
who's the representatives questionnaire
 
07:09:10.628 --> 07:09:10.638 align:start position:0%
is a member of the board and if he isn't
 
07:09:12.628 --> 07:09:12.638 align:start position:0%
able to the question answer the question
 
07:09:14.468 --> 07:09:14.478 align:start position:0%
i would be surprised sure
 
07:09:16.390 --> 07:09:16.400 align:start position:0%

and thank you mike for taking my
 
07:09:51.190 --> 07:09:51.200 align:start position:0%
question i asked senator sherman earlier
 
07:09:53.670 --> 07:09:53.680 align:start position:0%
about tools available to physicians who
 
07:09:56.230 --> 07:09:56.240 align:start position:0%
might be interested in the cost of the
 
07:09:58.070 --> 07:09:58.080 align:start position:0%
therapies that they are prescribing and
 
07:10:00.788 --> 07:10:00.798 align:start position:0%
we both lamented the lack of such tools
 
07:10:03.110 --> 07:10:03.120 align:start position:0%
to to individual physicians are you
 
07:10:05.430 --> 07:10:05.440 align:start position:0%
aware of any tools that would allow

physicians to do as representative
 
07:10:09.510 --> 07:10:09.520 align:start position:0%
fellows said earlier uh to basically
 
07:10:11.110 --> 07:10:11.120 align:start position:0%
help their patients in making these
 
07:10:13.350 --> 07:10:13.360 align:start position:0%
decisions that neither i nor senator
 
07:10:15.510 --> 07:10:15.520 align:start position:0%
sherman were aware of thank you for the
 
07:10:17.990 --> 07:10:18.000 align:start position:0%
question i'm not aware and i i do know
 
07:10:19.750 --> 07:10:19.760 align:start position:0%
in in my conversations with speaking
 
07:10:21.510 --> 07:10:21.520 align:start position:0%
with our council and our legislative
 
07:10:22.788 --> 07:10:22.798 align:start position:0%
committee that was one of their
 
07:10:25.110 --> 07:10:25.120 align:start position:0%
frustrations uh is not having some of
 
07:10:27.350 --> 07:10:27.360 align:start position:0%
those resources available to them and um
 
07:10:28.628 --> 07:10:28.638 align:start position:0%
i think that's one of the reasons why
 
07:10:31.110 --> 07:10:31.120 align:start position:0%
they really see a benefit in this board
 
07:10:33.350 --> 07:10:33.360 align:start position:0%
and having something that can uh maybe
 
07:10:35.590 --> 07:10:35.600 align:start position:0%
establish a model for for them moving
 
07:10:35.600 --> 07:10:36.628 align:start position:0%
establish a model for for them moving
forward

07:10:36.628 --> 07:10:36.638 align:start position:0%
forward
 
07:10:39.350 --> 07:10:39.360 align:start position:0%
i i thank you
 
07:10:43.590 --> 07:10:43.600 align:start position:0%

testimony
and

07:11:42.628 --> 07:11:42.638 align:start position:0%
and
 
07:11:44.150 --> 07:11:44.160 align:start position:0%
you don't need to read it to us could
 
07:11:46.468 --> 07:11:46.478 align:start position:0%
you just give us the highlights
 
07:11:49.750 --> 07:11:49.760 align:start position:0%
yes thank you madam chair um
 
07:11:51.590 --> 07:11:51.600 align:start position:0%
this is a new position for me so i'm
 
07:11:54.070 --> 07:11:54.080 align:start position:0%
still trying to learn the uh the
 
07:11:57.110 --> 07:11:57.120 align:start position:0%
my jargon for the the beginning
 
07:11:59.830 --> 07:11:59.840 align:start position:0%
i could probably rattle my new futures
 
07:12:03.910 --> 07:12:03.920 align:start position:0%
off um pretty easily um so i apologize i
 
07:12:05.990 --> 07:12:06.000 align:start position:0%
was reading the first paragraph
 
07:12:06.000 --> 07:12:06.788 align:start position:0%
was reading the first paragraph
um

07:12:06.788 --> 07:12:06.798 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:12:09.430 --> 07:12:09.440 align:start position:0%
you know par my my testimony does start
 
07:12:11.990 --> 07:12:12.000 align:start position:0%
off with the quote of the the governor
 
07:12:14.788 --> 07:12:14.798 align:start position:0%
which you've heard already
 
07:12:16.390 --> 07:12:16.400 align:start position:0%
you know a couple things that i just did
 
07:12:18.150 --> 07:12:18.160 align:start position:0%
want to highlight you've heard a lot
 
07:12:18.160 --> 07:12:19.030 align:start position:0%
want to highlight you've heard a lot
about

07:12:19.030 --> 07:12:19.040 align:start position:0%
about
 
07:12:21.510 --> 07:12:21.520 align:start position:0%
one of the main functions of the board
 
07:12:23.110 --> 07:12:23.120 align:start position:0%
which is
 
07:12:25.190 --> 07:12:25.200 align:start position:0%
looking at the public payers
 
07:12:26.468 --> 07:12:26.478 align:start position:0%
in the state
 
07:12:28.788 --> 07:12:28.798 align:start position:0%
another thing that this
 
07:12:31.590 --> 07:12:31.600 align:start position:0%
board would be able to do is is look at
 
07:12:33.350 --> 07:12:33.360 align:start position:0%
encouraging those public payers to
 
07:12:35.990 --> 07:12:36.000 align:start position:0%
possibly come together
 
07:12:36.000 --> 07:12:37.350 align:start position:0%
possibly come together
and

07:12:37.350 --> 07:12:37.360 align:start position:0%
and
 
07:12:40.548 --> 07:12:40.558 align:start position:0%
have one formulary right now
 
07:12:43.990 --> 07:12:44.000 align:start position:0%
the retirees have one formulary
 
07:12:47.430 --> 07:12:47.440 align:start position:0%
the state employees have one formulary
 
07:12:47.440 --> 07:12:50.230 align:start position:0%
the state employees have one formulary
the

07:12:50.230 --> 07:12:50.240 align:start position:0%
 
07:12:53.190 --> 07:12:53.200 align:start position:0%
the city employees in manchester have
 
07:12:55.510 --> 07:12:55.520 align:start position:0%
yet another formulary same thing in
 
07:12:55.520 --> 07:12:56.868 align:start position:0%
yet another formulary same thing in
nashua

07:12:56.868 --> 07:12:56.878 align:start position:0%
nashua
 
07:13:00.310 --> 07:13:00.320 align:start position:0%
same thing in claremont um you know
 
07:13:00.320 --> 07:13:01.350 align:start position:0%
same thing in claremont um you know
and

07:13:01.350 --> 07:13:01.360 align:start position:0%
and
 
07:13:04.230 --> 07:13:04.240 align:start position:0%
what this would do would allow
 
07:13:06.948 --> 07:13:06.958 align:start position:0%
this board to take a look at that
 
07:13:09.990 --> 07:13:10.000 align:start position:0%
information and see if it makes sense to
 
07:13:13.430 --> 07:13:13.440 align:start position:0%
have a statewide formulary that all of
 
07:13:16.548 --> 07:13:16.558 align:start position:0%
the public payers can use
 
07:13:18.868 --> 07:13:18.878 align:start position:0%
and can you because they can do
 
07:13:21.190 --> 07:13:21.200 align:start position:0%
excuse me they could possibly do bulk
 
07:13:24.548 --> 07:13:24.558 align:start position:0%
buying of drugs altogether
 
07:13:26.390 --> 07:13:26.400 align:start position:0%
so you don't have manchester buying
 
07:13:28.468 --> 07:13:28.478 align:start position:0%
drugs in nashua you've got them all
 
07:13:30.628 --> 07:13:30.638 align:start position:0%
together it's a bigger pool you can
 
07:13:30.638 --> 07:13:32.948 align:start position:0%
together it's a bigger pool you can
negotiate

07:13:32.948 --> 07:13:32.958 align:start position:0%
negotiate
 
07:13:35.390 --> 07:13:35.400 align:start position:0%
uh for for better prices with the drug
 
07:13:37.990 --> 07:13:38.000 align:start position:0%
manufacturers so that's another thing
 
07:13:38.000 --> 07:13:38.948 align:start position:0%
manufacturers so that's another thing
that

07:13:38.948 --> 07:13:38.958 align:start position:0%
that
 
07:13:41.030 --> 07:13:41.040 align:start position:0%
we haven't heard today that this board
 
07:13:44.548 --> 07:13:44.558 align:start position:0%
would be able to look at and recommend
 
07:13:46.948 --> 07:13:46.958 align:start position:0%
another thing too is that small
 
07:13:46.958 --> 07:13:49.510 align:start position:0%
another thing too is that small
businesses

07:13:49.510 --> 07:13:49.520 align:start position:0%
businesses
 
07:13:52.708 --> 07:13:52.718 align:start position:0%
 
07:13:54.390 --> 07:13:54.400 align:start position:0%
see if maybe
 
07:13:56.948 --> 07:13:56.958 align:start position:0%
they wanted to buy this formulary
 
07:13:58.708 --> 07:13:58.718 align:start position:0%
because if you look through the statute
 
07:14:00.390 --> 07:14:00.400 align:start position:0%
there is a provision
 
07:14:03.510 --> 07:14:03.520 align:start position:0%
that would allow small businesses to be
 
07:14:06.310 --> 07:14:06.320 align:start position:0%
able to buy into so that would help so a
 
07:14:08.468 --> 07:14:08.478 align:start position:0%
lot of our small businesses that are
 
07:14:10.390 --> 07:14:10.400 align:start position:0%
struggling to even provide health
 
07:14:10.400 --> 07:14:12.390 align:start position:0%
struggling to even provide health
insurance

07:14:12.390 --> 07:14:12.400 align:start position:0%
insurance
 
07:14:14.390 --> 07:14:14.400 align:start position:0%
because of the cost if they would be
 
07:14:17.350 --> 07:14:17.360 align:start position:0%
able to buy into a state formulary
 
07:14:19.350 --> 07:14:19.360 align:start position:0%
that is a lot cheaper they might be able
 
07:14:22.070 --> 07:14:22.080 align:start position:0%
to afford
 
07:14:24.070 --> 07:14:24.080 align:start position:0%
health insurance for
 
07:14:27.110 --> 07:14:27.120 align:start position:0%
their employees
 
07:14:29.190 --> 07:14:29.200 align:start position:0%
and then the second
 
07:14:33.590 --> 07:14:33.600 align:start position:0%
 
07:14:35.830 --> 07:14:35.840 align:start position:0%
is to is to gather the information but
 
07:14:37.830 --> 07:14:37.840 align:start position:0%
specifically and i apologize i just need
 
07:14:40.390 --> 07:14:40.400 align:start position:0%
to to read exactly what they need to do
 
07:14:40.400 --> 07:14:43.350 align:start position:0%
to to read exactly what they need to do
they

07:14:43.350 --> 07:14:43.360 align:start position:0%
 
07:14:47.350 --> 07:14:47.360 align:start position:0%
have to gather information
 
07:14:47.360 --> 07:14:48.548 align:start position:0%
have to gather information
on

07:14:48.548 --> 07:14:48.558 align:start position:0%
on
 
07:14:50.150 --> 07:14:50.160 align:start position:0%
the costliest
 
07:14:52.310 --> 07:14:52.320 align:start position:0%
drugs in the state
 
07:14:55.910 --> 07:14:55.920 align:start position:0%
the most prescribed drugs in the state
 
07:14:58.150 --> 07:14:58.160 align:start position:0%
and the medications with the highest
 
07:15:01.830 --> 07:15:01.840 align:start position:0%
year over year increases
 
07:15:04.548 --> 07:15:04.558 align:start position:0%
and they have to report out on that so
 
07:15:07.190 --> 07:15:07.200 align:start position:0%
that everybody in new hampshire
 
07:15:09.750 --> 07:15:09.760 align:start position:0%
knows what those are it's the 25
 
07:15:12.390 --> 07:15:12.400 align:start position:0%
costliest the 25 most prescribed and the
 
07:15:16.390 --> 07:15:16.400 align:start position:0%
25 with increases year over year
 
07:15:18.708 --> 07:15:18.718 align:start position:0%
you know just having that information
 
07:15:21.350 --> 07:15:21.360 align:start position:0%
and just having that transparency one
 
07:15:24.310 --> 07:15:24.320 align:start position:0%
can sometimes put downward pressure on
 
07:15:26.070 --> 07:15:26.080 align:start position:0%
the manufacturers because they have to
 
07:15:28.788 --> 07:15:28.798 align:start position:0%
report it but secondly
 
07:15:30.468 --> 07:15:30.478 align:start position:0%
it does allow
 
07:15:30.478 --> 07:15:31.430 align:start position:0%
it does allow
um

07:15:31.430 --> 07:15:31.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:15:33.430 --> 07:15:33.440 align:start position:0%
for the state
 
07:15:35.750 --> 07:15:35.760 align:start position:0%
to look and see if there's anything that
 
07:15:37.110 --> 07:15:37.120 align:start position:0%
can be done
 
07:15:39.190 --> 07:15:39.200 align:start position:0%
to try to get a hold of
 
07:15:41.910 --> 07:15:41.920 align:start position:0%
these prescription drug prices for
 
07:15:44.708 --> 07:15:44.718 align:start position:0%
instance also in house bill 1280 was the
 
07:15:47.190 --> 07:15:47.200 align:start position:0%
copay cap on insulin
 
07:15:49.110 --> 07:15:49.120 align:start position:0%
if you remember
 
07:15:51.190 --> 07:15:51.200 align:start position:0%
that was one drug that was pulled out
 
07:15:53.110 --> 07:15:53.120 align:start position:0%
because it was very costly and the
 
07:15:55.270 --> 07:15:55.280 align:start position:0%
increases kept going year over year over
 
07:15:55.280 --> 07:15:56.390 align:start position:0%
increases kept going year over year over
year

07:15:56.390 --> 07:15:56.400 align:start position:0%
year
 
07:15:56.400 --> 07:15:57.830 align:start position:0%
year
so

07:15:57.830 --> 07:15:57.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
07:16:00.788 --> 07:16:00.798 align:start position:0%
you folks decided that enough was enough
 
07:16:00.798 --> 07:16:02.390 align:start position:0%
you folks decided that enough was enough
and

07:16:02.390 --> 07:16:02.400 align:start position:0%
and
 
07:16:03.910 --> 07:16:03.920 align:start position:0%
people weren't going to have to pay that
 
07:16:07.110 --> 07:16:07.120 align:start position:0%
anymore so this information can allow
 
07:16:09.990 --> 07:16:10.000 align:start position:0%
you to to look at that on paper and say
 
07:16:10.000 --> 07:16:11.030 align:start position:0%
you to to look at that on paper and say
okay

07:16:11.030 --> 07:16:11.040 align:start position:0%
okay
 
07:16:12.788 --> 07:16:12.798 align:start position:0%
you know what do i need to do for my
 
07:16:15.868 --> 07:16:15.878 align:start position:0%
constituents in order to make this more
 
07:16:22.310 --> 07:16:22.320 align:start position:0%
 
07:16:24.310 --> 07:16:24.320 align:start position:0%
and i think with that i will just end my
 
07:16:26.230 --> 07:16:26.240 align:start position:0%
testimony and if you have any questions
 
07:16:28.230 --> 07:16:28.240 align:start position:0%

07:16:28.240 --> 07:16:29.430 align:start position:0%
i'm more than happy to take them i did

07:16:29.430 --> 07:16:29.440 align:start position:0%
include
 
07:16:31.910 --> 07:16:31.920 align:start position:0%
with my testimony three pieces of
 
07:16:33.510 --> 07:16:33.520 align:start position:0%
testimony from
 
07:16:34.868 --> 07:16:34.878 align:start position:0%
folks that are
 
07:16:37.430 --> 07:16:37.440 align:start position:0%
nami new hampshire advocates on their
 
07:16:41.830 --> 07:16:41.840 align:start position:0%
experience with high cost of drugs
 
07:16:43.590 --> 07:16:43.600 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for that
 
07:16:45.750 --> 07:16:45.760 align:start position:0%
is there any questions
 
07:16:47.590 --> 07:16:47.600 align:start position:0%
representative marsh
 
07:16:49.110 --> 07:16:49.120 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you holly
 
07:16:50.628 --> 07:16:50.638 align:start position:0%
for taking my question first of all
 
07:16:52.548 --> 07:16:52.558 align:start position:0%
congratulations on your new position
 
07:16:54.310 --> 07:16:54.320 align:start position:0%
it's a pleasure to see you again you've
 
07:16:57.430 --> 07:16:57.440 align:start position:0%
got very big shoes to fill um it's my
 
07:16:59.030 --> 07:16:59.040 align:start position:0%
understanding that drugs used in
 
07:17:01.030 --> 07:17:01.040 align:start position:0%
behavioral health who are the people
 
07:17:03.190 --> 07:17:03.200 align:start position:0%
that you represent now
 
07:17:05.190 --> 07:17:05.200 align:start position:0%
are particularly expensive for some of
 
07:17:06.708 --> 07:17:06.718 align:start position:0%
these patients particularly in relation
 
07:17:09.030 --> 07:17:09.040 align:start position:0%
to their income uh would you like to
 
07:17:10.868 --> 07:17:10.878 align:start position:0%
speak to us for a moment as to the
 
07:17:13.030 --> 07:17:13.040 align:start position:0%
consequences to these patients when they
 
07:17:15.830 --> 07:17:15.840 align:start position:0%
cannot afford or are forced to ration
 
07:17:17.670 --> 07:17:17.680 align:start position:0%
the drugs that they are used needing to
 
07:17:19.430 --> 07:17:19.440 align:start position:0%
use for treating their excuse me
 
07:17:21.350 --> 07:17:21.360 align:start position:0%
representative marsh i don't believe
 
07:17:23.030 --> 07:17:23.040 align:start position:0%
that's exactly
 
07:17:27.190 --> 07:17:27.200 align:start position:0%
 
07:17:30.230 --> 07:17:30.240 align:start position:0%
i i beg to differ because if we
 
07:17:32.310 --> 07:17:32.320 align:start position:0%
since most of the people that she
 
07:17:35.430 --> 07:17:35.440 align:start position:0%
represents are actually insured under
 
07:17:37.270 --> 07:17:37.280 align:start position:0%
the state health insurance plans
 
07:17:39.830 --> 07:17:39.840 align:start position:0%
including the three medicaid plans uh
 
07:17:41.110 --> 07:17:41.120 align:start position:0%
therefore they're not being able to
 
07:17:42.708 --> 07:17:42.718 align:start position:0%
obtain their drugs as exceedingly
 
07:17:44.708 --> 07:17:44.718 align:start position:0%
relevant uh to
 
07:17:46.230 --> 07:17:46.240 align:start position:0%
repealing the prescription drug
 
07:17:48.548 --> 07:17:48.558 align:start position:0%
affordability board which is uh trying
 
07:17:50.468 --> 07:17:50.478 align:start position:0%
to make those drugs less expensive to
 
07:17:53.590 --> 07:17:53.600 align:start position:0%
those very payers i don't think it's
 
07:17:55.110 --> 07:17:55.120 align:start position:0%
actually relevant
 
07:17:58.150 --> 07:17:58.160 align:start position:0%
and also it's 4 3 it's 4 20
 
07:18:00.388 --> 07:18:00.398 align:start position:0%
and it's been a very long day i don't
 
07:18:03.030 --> 07:18:03.040 align:start position:0%
think it's relevant or useful we can all
 
07:18:05.110 --> 07:18:05.120 align:start position:0%
agree that lower prescription drugs
 
07:18:07.830 --> 07:18:07.840 align:start position:0%
prices for people would be a good thing
 
07:18:10.070 --> 07:18:10.080 align:start position:0%
the question we're debating is is this a
 
07:18:15.430 --> 07:18:15.440 align:start position:0%
 
07:18:17.110 --> 07:18:17.120 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
07:18:18.788 --> 07:18:18.798 align:start position:0%
i have a question madam chair is this
 
07:18:20.788 --> 07:18:20.798 align:start position:0%
going to a subcommittee or are we go
 
07:18:22.708 --> 07:18:22.718 align:start position:0%
representative schmidt i'm afraid that
 
07:18:24.548 --> 07:18:24.558 align:start position:0%
it will not be going to a subcommittee
 
07:18:26.388 --> 07:18:26.398 align:start position:0%
because it's an early bill we have to
 
07:18:27.750 --> 07:18:27.760 align:start position:0%
vote it out
 
07:18:29.990 --> 07:18:30.000 align:start position:0%
and have the report in no later than
 
07:18:32.948 --> 07:18:32.958 align:start position:0%
this thursday
 
07:18:39.510 --> 07:18:39.520 align:start position:0%
 
07:18:41.510 --> 07:18:41.520 align:start position:0%
any other questions seeing none i'll
 
07:18:54.468 --> 07:18:54.478 align:start position:0%
 
07:18:56.230 --> 07:18:56.240 align:start position:0%

surely our friends and neighbors your
constituents

07:19:40.070 --> 07:19:40.080 align:start position:0%
constituents
 
07:19:42.070 --> 07:19:42.080 align:start position:0%
are having to decide
 
07:19:43.830 --> 07:19:43.840 align:start position:0%
whether they're going to be able to pay
 
07:19:45.430 --> 07:19:45.440 align:start position:0%
for their meds
 
07:19:45.440 --> 07:19:46.548 align:start position:0%
for their meds
or

07:19:46.548 --> 07:19:46.558 align:start position:0%
or
 
07:19:50.070 --> 07:19:50.080 align:start position:0%
they will have to um or pay for their

utilities
 
07:19:53.190 --> 07:19:53.200 align:start position:0%
or their food
 
07:19:55.430 --> 07:19:55.440 align:start position:0%
that's a reality
 
07:19:56.948 --> 07:19:56.958 align:start position:0%
we did a survey
 
07:20:00.788 --> 07:20:00.798 align:start position:0%
statistically significant survey in 2020
 
07:20:00.798 --> 07:20:01.510 align:start position:0%
statistically significant survey in 2020
of

07:20:01.510 --> 07:20:01.520 align:start position:0%
of
 
07:20:04.310 --> 07:20:04.320 align:start position:0%
45 plus granite staters
 
07:20:06.310 --> 07:20:06.320 align:start position:0%
across the political spectrum from the
 
07:20:08.150 --> 07:20:08.160 align:start position:0%
left to the right
 
07:20:10.708 --> 07:20:10.718 align:start position:0%
um 45 years old plus
 
07:20:13.030 --> 07:20:13.040 align:start position:0%
85 percent of them and i'm happy to
 
07:20:14.948 --> 07:20:14.958 align:start position:0%
share that survey
 
07:20:14.958 --> 07:20:15.830 align:start position:0%
share that survey
said

07:20:15.830 --> 07:20:15.840 align:start position:0%
said
 
07:20:17.430 --> 07:20:17.440 align:start position:0%
that this was extremely or very
 
07:20:18.788 --> 07:20:18.798 align:start position:0%
important to them to deal with the
 
07:20:20.548 --> 07:20:20.558 align:start position:0%
escalating cost of prescription drug
 
07:20:20.558 --> 07:20:21.910 align:start position:0%
escalating cost of prescription drug
prices

07:20:21.910 --> 07:20:21.920 align:start position:0%
prices
 
07:20:24.150 --> 07:20:24.160 align:start position:0%
i was absolutely
 
07:20:26.230 --> 07:20:26.240 align:start position:0%
so proud of the work that this
 
07:20:27.910 --> 07:20:27.920 align:start position:0%
legislature did
 
07:20:29.830 --> 07:20:29.840 align:start position:0%
by way of concurrence omnibus bill or
 
07:20:29.840 --> 07:20:31.190 align:start position:0%
by way of concurrence omnibus bill or
otherwise

07:20:31.190 --> 07:20:31.200 align:start position:0%
otherwise
 
07:20:34.070 --> 07:20:34.080 align:start position:0%
in 2020 in the midst of a pandemic you
 
07:20:35.670 --> 07:20:35.680 align:start position:0%
all saw fit
 
07:20:38.070 --> 07:20:38.080 align:start position:0%
to bring a needed transparency to an
 
07:20:39.670 --> 07:20:39.680 align:start position:0%
industry that has operated without
 
07:20:41.990 --> 07:20:42.000 align:start position:0%
transparency for years
 
07:20:43.910 --> 07:20:43.920 align:start position:0%
and now
 
07:20:45.830 --> 07:20:45.840 align:start position:0%
and i understand the reasoning and i
 
07:20:48.388 --> 07:20:48.398 align:start position:0%
respect the reasoning in the thinking
 
07:20:50.948 --> 07:20:50.958 align:start position:0%
of our elected officials
 
07:20:53.670 --> 07:20:53.680 align:start position:0%
but now in one motion
 
07:20:56.310 --> 07:20:56.320 align:start position:0%
in hours and hours of work
 
07:20:59.110 --> 07:20:59.120 align:start position:0%
we're on the precipice of of
 
07:21:01.190 --> 07:21:01.200 align:start position:0%
abolishing the board
 
07:21:03.750 --> 07:21:03.760 align:start position:0%
not trying to fix it mind you
 
07:21:07.110 --> 07:21:07.120 align:start position:0%
 
07:21:09.590 --> 07:21:09.600 align:start position:0%
the board does not act in secrecy
 
07:21:11.830 --> 07:21:11.840 align:start position:0%
i've sat on every board meeting some in
 
07:21:14.628 --> 07:21:14.638 align:start position:0%
person some virtually since it began
 
07:21:16.230 --> 07:21:16.240 align:start position:0%
we have heard from the pharmaceutical
 
07:21:16.240 --> 07:21:17.670 align:start position:0%
we have heard from the pharmaceutical
industry

07:21:17.670 --> 07:21:17.680 align:start position:0%
industry
 
07:21:20.388 --> 07:21:20.398 align:start position:0%
from pharmacy benefit managers from
 
07:21:23.190 --> 07:21:23.200 align:start position:0%
experts in the fields all of it's public
 
07:21:24.788 --> 07:21:24.798 align:start position:0%
we're administratively attached to the
 
07:21:26.310 --> 07:21:26.320 align:start position:0%
department of health and human services
 
07:21:27.910 --> 07:21:27.920 align:start position:0%
i would encourage you to go watch if
 
07:21:29.110 --> 07:21:29.120 align:start position:0%
you'd like
 
07:21:31.270 --> 07:21:31.280 align:start position:0%
everything has been
 
07:21:34.548 --> 07:21:34.558 align:start position:0%
 
07:21:37.030 --> 07:21:37.040 align:start position:0%
the biggest fear i have on this board in
 
07:21:38.388 --> 07:21:38.398 align:start position:0%
all honesty
 
07:21:40.548 --> 07:21:40.558 align:start position:0%
and i am a lawyer 21 years of experience
 
07:21:41.990 --> 07:21:42.000 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire and i'm also a granite
 
07:21:43.590 --> 07:21:43.600 align:start position:0%
stater i grew up here was born here
 
07:21:45.270 --> 07:21:45.280 align:start position:0%
proud of it
 
07:21:49.750 --> 07:21:49.760 align:start position:0%
is the the requirement to safeguard the
 
07:21:51.990 --> 07:21:52.000 align:start position:0%
this confidential information produced
 
07:21:53.350 --> 07:21:53.360 align:start position:0%
to the board
 
07:21:55.190 --> 07:21:55.200 align:start position:0%
if that leaks out
 
07:21:56.868 --> 07:21:56.878 align:start position:0%
i don't want to even be able to have to
 
07:21:59.030 --> 07:21:59.040 align:start position:0%
touch that information and somehow get
 
07:22:00.868 --> 07:22:00.878 align:start position:0%
sued by the pharmaceutical industry for
 
07:22:03.590 --> 07:22:03.600 align:start position:0%
disclosing proprietary information
 
07:22:06.388 --> 07:22:06.398 align:start position:0%
there's very very very strong
 
07:22:09.830 --> 07:22:09.840 align:start position:0%
requirements to maintain confidentiality
 
07:22:09.840 --> 07:22:10.788 align:start position:0%
requirements to maintain confidentiality
so

07:22:10.788 --> 07:22:10.798 align:start position:0%
so
 
07:22:13.910 --> 07:22:13.920 align:start position:0%
the idea that we would in any way be uh
 
07:22:16.070 --> 07:22:16.080 align:start position:0%
cavalier or loose with confidential
 
07:22:16.080 --> 07:22:17.430 align:start position:0%
cavalier or loose with confidential
information

07:22:17.430 --> 07:22:17.440 align:start position:0%
information
 
07:22:19.510 --> 07:22:19.520 align:start position:0%
i think frankly as a board member the
 
07:22:21.750 --> 07:22:21.760 align:start position:0%
board itself by the statute and
 
07:22:23.990 --> 07:22:24.000 align:start position:0%
individual members would be held liable
 
07:22:25.750 --> 07:22:25.760 align:start position:0%
and i can imagine that would be a pretty
 
07:22:25.760 --> 07:22:26.868 align:start position:0%
and i can imagine that would be a pretty
severe

07:22:26.868 --> 07:22:26.878 align:start position:0%
severe
 
07:22:26.878 --> 07:22:28.310 align:start position:0%
severe
consequence

07:22:28.310 --> 07:22:28.320 align:start position:0%
consequence
 
07:22:29.990 --> 07:22:30.000 align:start position:0%
i'm recognizing the time is short so
 
07:22:31.030 --> 07:22:31.040 align:start position:0%
i'll wrap
 
07:22:33.910 --> 07:22:33.920 align:start position:0%
 
07:22:35.670 --> 07:22:35.680 align:start position:0%
year over year
 
07:22:37.990 --> 07:22:38.000 align:start position:0%
prescription drug prices have increased
 
07:22:41.270 --> 07:22:41.280 align:start position:0%
year over year
 
07:22:42.388 --> 07:22:42.398 align:start position:0%
every year and now we're in an
 
07:22:44.708 --> 07:22:44.718 align:start position:0%
inflationary environment where what was
 
07:22:48.070 --> 07:22:48.080 align:start position:0%
maybe worse before and was worse before
 
07:22:50.628 --> 07:22:50.638 align:start position:0%
is infinitely worse now
 
07:22:52.708 --> 07:22:52.718 align:start position:0%
for our fellow granite staters who are
 
07:22:54.388 --> 07:22:54.398 align:start position:0%
depending upon
 
07:22:56.310 --> 07:22:56.320 align:start position:0%
this group
 
07:22:59.270 --> 07:22:59.280 align:start position:0%
this board and frankly this body
 
07:23:01.270 --> 07:23:01.280 align:start position:0%
to stand with them
 
07:23:03.590 --> 07:23:03.600 align:start position:0%
if you abolish this board
 
07:23:05.590 --> 07:23:05.600 align:start position:0%
you are abolishing perhaps the best
 
07:23:08.070 --> 07:23:08.080 align:start position:0%
opportunity for transparency that we've
 
07:23:08.080 --> 07:23:09.430 align:start position:0%
opportunity for transparency that we've
seen

07:23:09.430 --> 07:23:09.440 align:start position:0%
seen
 
07:23:11.510 --> 07:23:11.520 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire to understand
 
07:23:13.910 --> 07:23:13.920 align:start position:0%
prescription drug pricing
 
07:23:16.388 --> 07:23:16.398 align:start position:0%
we do have commerce clause issues here
 
07:23:18.230 --> 07:23:18.240 align:start position:0%
we're not going to be
 
07:23:19.750 --> 07:23:19.760 align:start position:0%
fixing prices
 
07:23:21.270 --> 07:23:21.280 align:start position:0%
we're not going to be selling
 
07:23:23.030 --> 07:23:23.040 align:start position:0%
proprietary information surely i
 
07:23:24.708 --> 07:23:24.718 align:start position:0%
wouldn't do it i don't want to be
 
07:23:26.150 --> 07:23:26.160 align:start position:0%
selling information from merck
 
07:23:28.310 --> 07:23:28.320 align:start position:0%
pharmaceuticals or any other and then
 
07:23:30.948 --> 07:23:30.958 align:start position:0%
have to explain myself
 
07:23:32.468 --> 07:23:32.478 align:start position:0%
but i think one of the i think
 
07:23:34.310 --> 07:23:34.320 align:start position:0%
representative scitech asked a question
 
07:23:35.590 --> 07:23:35.600 align:start position:0%
how do you know
 
07:23:37.590 --> 07:23:37.600 align:start position:0%
how do you know if you've done anything
 
07:23:39.750 --> 07:23:39.760 align:start position:0%
worthwhile at the end of the day here's
 
07:23:42.948 --> 07:23:42.958 align:start position:0%
what i'll tell you a front page headline
 
07:23:45.670 --> 07:23:45.680 align:start position:0%
showing the the the findings of the
 
07:23:45.680 --> 07:23:48.310 align:start position:0%

explaining to the public by way of
 
07:23:52.868 --> 07:23:52.878 align:start position:0%
public report the following information
 
07:23:54.948 --> 07:23:54.958 align:start position:0%
about prescription drugs both brand name
 
07:23:57.270 --> 07:23:57.280 align:start position:0%
and generic the 25 most frequently
 
07:24:00.070 --> 07:24:00.080 align:start position:0%
prescribed drugs in the state the 25
 
07:24:01.990 --> 07:24:02.000 align:start position:0%
costliest drugs as determined by the
 
07:24:04.230 --> 07:24:04.240 align:start position:0%
total amount spent on those drugs in the
 
07:24:06.310 --> 07:24:06.320 align:start position:0%

year-over-year cost increases as

determined by the total amount spent on
 
07:24:17.110 --> 07:24:17.120 align:start position:0%
those drugs in the state would we not
 
07:24:19.510 --> 07:24:19.520 align:start position:0%
want to know that we're so smart here in
 
07:24:20.788 --> 07:24:20.798 align:start position:0%
the granite state
 
07:24:22.388 --> 07:24:22.398 align:start position:0%
i was so proud of what we did in a
 
07:24:26.070 --> 07:24:26.080 align:start position:0%
bipartisan way of 2020 i'm imploring you
 
07:24:27.590 --> 07:24:27.600 align:start position:0%
with all due respect for those who
 
07:24:29.590 --> 07:24:29.600 align:start position:0%
disagree with our position
 
07:24:31.510 --> 07:24:31.520 align:start position:0%
to to
 
07:24:33.510 --> 07:24:33.520 align:start position:0%
maintain this board vote down this
 
07:24:33.520 --> 07:24:34.868 align:start position:0%
maintain this board vote down this
amendment

07:24:34.868 --> 07:24:34.878 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
07:24:37.350 --> 07:24:37.360 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
07:24:38.788 --> 07:24:38.798 align:start position:0%
thank you very much are there any
 
07:24:42.388 --> 07:24:42.398 align:start position:0%
 
07:24:44.388 --> 07:24:44.398 align:start position:0%
yes representative horrigan thank you
 
07:24:46.310 --> 07:24:46.320 align:start position:0%
very much and uh thanks for your
 
07:24:48.948 --> 07:24:48.958 align:start position:0%
testimony my membership fee
 
07:24:50.310 --> 07:24:50.320 align:start position:0%
the fraction of a penny that's my
 
07:24:52.708 --> 07:24:52.718 align:start position:0%
membership fee was well spent um
 
07:24:54.548 --> 07:24:54.558 align:start position:0%
my question is um is there anything we
 
07:24:55.830 --> 07:24:55.840 align:start position:0%
can learn from the rollout of the
 
07:24:57.990 --> 07:24:58.000 align:start position:0%
vaccines which i'm sure are difficult to
 
07:24:59.910 --> 07:24:59.920 align:start position:0%
manufacture and very expensive developed
 
07:25:01.190 --> 07:25:01.200 align:start position:0%
just like
 
07:25:05.030 --> 07:25:05.040 align:start position:0%
 
07:25:07.030 --> 07:25:07.040 align:start position:0%
not it's not as simple as it should be
 
07:25:09.590 --> 07:25:09.600 align:start position:0%
but we developed a relatively uh simple
 
07:25:11.030 --> 07:25:11.040 align:start position:0%
mechanism for distributing them and
 
07:25:13.510 --> 07:25:13.520 align:start position:0%
they've been available to free to anyone
 
07:25:16.548 --> 07:25:16.558 align:start position:0%
who who wants it so why
 
07:25:18.070 --> 07:25:18.080 align:start position:0%
is there anything we can learn from that
 
07:25:20.788 --> 07:25:20.798 align:start position:0%
and change the way we distribute other
 
07:25:23.750 --> 07:25:23.760 align:start position:0%
 
07:25:24.708 --> 07:25:24.718 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
07:25:27.030 --> 07:25:27.040 align:start position:0%
representative horrigan
 
07:25:29.430 --> 07:25:29.440 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure i i think that the rollout
 
07:25:32.070 --> 07:25:32.080 align:start position:0%
of the the vaccines that's uh that's a
 
07:25:33.430 --> 07:25:33.440 align:start position:0%
tough question i mean we're obviously a
 
07:25:35.030 --> 07:25:35.040 align:start position:0%
very divided nation over whether we even
 
07:25:37.190 --> 07:25:37.200 align:start position:0%
like the vaccines um certainly in new
 
07:25:38.708 --> 07:25:38.718 align:start position:0%
hampshire um
 
07:25:40.948 --> 07:25:40.958 align:start position:0%
i i guess i would say
 
07:25:43.750 --> 07:25:43.760 align:start position:0%
the focus here is on uh affordability
 
07:25:45.350 --> 07:25:45.360 align:start position:0%
representative so i don't know if there
 
07:25:46.948 --> 07:25:46.958 align:start position:0%
are direct lessons to be learned and if
 
07:25:50.628 --> 07:25:50.638 align:start position:0%
 
07:25:52.468 --> 07:25:52.478 align:start position:0%
thank you are there other questions from
 
07:25:55.030 --> 07:25:55.040 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
07:25:56.388 --> 07:25:56.398 align:start position:0%
all right seeing none thank you for your
 
07:25:58.070 --> 07:25:58.080 align:start position:0%
testimony thank you madam chair
 
07:25:59.830 --> 07:25:59.840 align:start position:0%
committee members i don't have any more
 
07:26:01.590 --> 07:26:01.600 align:start position:0%
cards is there anyone else who wishes to
 
07:26:01.600 --> 07:26:02.708 align:start position:0%
cards is there anyone else who wishes to
testify

07:26:02.708 --> 07:26:02.718 align:start position:0%
testify
 
07:26:08.310 --> 07:26:08.320 align:start position:0%
 
07:26:11.350 --> 07:26:11.360 align:start position:0%
okay seeing none i'm going to close the
 
07:26:13.510 --> 07:26:13.520 align:start position:0%

07:26:21.830 --> 07:26:21.840 align:start position:0%
and i think i would ask everyone else to
 
07:26:22.948 --> 07:26:22.958 align:start position:0%
leave the room because we're going to
 
07:26:25.830 --> 07:26:25.840 align:start position:0%
have a republican caucus for about
 
07:26:31.190 --> 07:26:31.200 align:start position:0%
 
07:26:36.830 --> 07:26:36.840 align:start position:0%
 
07:26:39.350 --> 07:26:39.360 align:start position:0%
okay quarter of
 
07:26:44.948 --> 07:26:44.958 align:start position:0%
 
07:26:51.670 --> 07:26:51.680 align:start position:0%
 
07:27:06.388 --> 07:27:06.398 align:start position:0%
 
07:27:06.398 --> 07:44:49.030 align:start position:0%
 
questions

07:44:49.030 --> 07:44:49.040 align:start position:0%
 
07:44:51.750 --> 07:44:51.760 align:start position:0%
thank you i think we're all here except
 
07:44:57.190 --> 07:44:57.200 align:start position:0%
 
07:44:58.868 --> 07:44:58.878 align:start position:0%
okay well that won't take her too too
 
07:45:01.110 --> 07:45:01.120 align:start position:0%
long to come back
 
07:45:04.310 --> 07:45:04.320 align:start position:0%
all right we have two two bills early
 
07:45:06.230 --> 07:45:06.240 align:start position:0%
bills that we need to vote out of
 
07:45:06.240 --> 07:45:07.590 align:start position:0%
bills that we need to vote out of
committee

07:45:07.590 --> 07:45:07.600 align:start position:0%
committee
 
07:45:07.600 --> 07:45:09.270 align:start position:0%
committee
so

07:45:09.270 --> 07:45:09.280 align:start position:0%
so
 
07:45:12.788 --> 07:45:12.798 align:start position:0%
rep i'm going to to move ought to pass
 
07:45:14.190 --> 07:45:14.200 align:start position:0%
for house bill
 
07:45:22.070 --> 07:45:22.080 align:start position:0%
 
07:45:22.080 --> 07:45:26.788 align:start position:0%
 
okay

07:45:26.788 --> 07:45:26.798 align:start position:0%
 
07:45:29.670 --> 07:45:29.680 align:start position:0%
this is a there's copies available on
 
07:45:31.030 --> 07:45:31.040 align:start position:0%
the table
 
07:45:33.430 --> 07:45:33.440 align:start position:0%
it's a minor update of the amendment
 
07:45:36.150 --> 07:45:36.160 align:start position:0%
that i discussed with the subcommittee
 
07:45:39.030 --> 07:45:39.040 align:start position:0%
and then had earlier representative
 
07:45:41.190 --> 07:45:41.200 align:start position:0%
scitec caught a typo
 
07:45:43.430 --> 07:45:43.440 align:start position:0%
and so we had to get a new amendment but
 
07:45:50.548 --> 07:45:50.558 align:start position:0%
 
07:45:50.558 --> 07:45:52.628 align:start position:0%
 
right

07:45:52.628 --> 07:45:52.638 align:start position:0%
right
 
07:45:52.638 --> 07:45:56.150 align:start position:0%
right
the

07:45:56.150 --> 07:45:56.160 align:start position:0%
 
07:45:59.750 --> 07:45:59.760 align:start position:0%
the amendment leaves the
 
07:46:01.990 --> 07:46:02.000 align:start position:0%
cost of living adjustment
 
07:46:05.110 --> 07:46:05.120 align:start position:0%
at one and a half percent on
 
07:46:08.948 --> 07:46:08.958 align:start position:0%
july 1st 2022 for people who have been
 
07:46:11.110 --> 07:46:11.120 align:start position:0%
retired for five years
 
07:46:13.350 --> 07:46:13.360 align:start position:0%
and on the first thirty thousand of
 
07:46:15.670 --> 07:46:15.680 align:start position:0%
their re of their pension
 
07:46:18.468 --> 07:46:18.478 align:start position:0%
so that's left that's there
 
07:46:22.548 --> 07:46:22.558 align:start position:0%
 
07:46:24.230 --> 07:46:24.240 align:start position:0%
representative rhodes
 
07:46:25.430 --> 07:46:25.440 align:start position:0%
you might mention that their
 
07:46:27.350 --> 07:46:27.360 align:start position:0%
subcommittee was unanimous yes the
 
07:46:29.190 --> 07:46:29.200 align:start position:0%
subcommittee agreed on this
 
07:46:32.708 --> 07:46:32.718 align:start position:0%
in principle unanimously
 
07:46:34.310 --> 07:46:34.320 align:start position:0%
i'm just describing what it is for the
 
07:46:35.990 --> 07:46:36.000 align:start position:0%
rest of the committee
 
07:46:36.000 --> 07:46:36.948 align:start position:0%
rest of the committee
it

07:46:36.948 --> 07:46:36.958 align:start position:0%
it
 
07:46:38.708 --> 07:46:38.718 align:start position:0%
then eliminates
 
07:46:38.718 --> 07:46:41.750 align:start position:0%
then eliminates
the

07:46:41.750 --> 07:46:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
07:46:41.760 --> 07:46:44.150 align:start position:0%
 
unrestrained

07:46:44.150 --> 07:46:44.160 align:start position:0%
unrestrained
 
07:46:46.468 --> 07:46:46.478 align:start position:0%
annual cost of living increases by the
 
07:46:49.190 --> 07:46:49.200 align:start position:0%
retirement system which would cost
 
07:46:51.830 --> 07:46:51.840 align:start position:0%
approximately two billion dollars
 
07:46:53.510 --> 07:46:53.520 align:start position:0%
because the subcommittee thought that
 
07:46:54.830 --> 07:46:54.840 align:start position:0%
was a bit
 
07:46:59.510 --> 07:46:59.520 align:start position:0%
much it also puts the cost of the
 
07:46:59.520 --> 07:47:00.708 align:start position:0%
much it also puts the cost of the
this

07:47:00.708 --> 07:47:00.718 align:start position:0%
this
 
07:47:03.590 --> 07:47:03.600 align:start position:0%
 
07:47:06.310 --> 07:47:06.320 align:start position:0%
into the retirement fund as a lump sum
 
07:47:08.830 --> 07:47:08.840 align:start position:0%
paying for the whole whole cost of
 
07:47:12.548 --> 07:47:12.558 align:start position:0%
it from this year's general fund
 
07:47:15.190 --> 07:47:15.200 align:start position:0%
and that is the way we used to do
 
07:47:17.110 --> 07:47:17.120 align:start position:0%
cost of living increases when we were
 
07:47:20.070 --> 07:47:20.080 align:start position:0%
 
07:47:22.548 --> 07:47:22.558 align:start position:0%
as conditions warranted we would say
 
07:47:24.628 --> 07:47:24.638 align:start position:0%
okay we can afford for a cost of living
 
07:47:27.190 --> 07:47:27.200 align:start position:0%
increase here's the money for it and put
 
07:47:29.190 --> 07:47:29.200 align:start position:0%
it in the retirement system to pay for
 
07:47:30.468 --> 07:47:30.478 align:start position:0%
it forever
 
07:47:33.110 --> 07:47:33.120 align:start position:0%
we didn't take out a 20-year mortgage
 
07:47:35.990 --> 07:47:36.000 align:start position:0%
which is what we did in 19 when we get
 
07:47:38.468 --> 07:47:38.478 align:start position:0%
granted a cost of living increase
 
07:47:41.110 --> 07:47:41.120 align:start position:0%
 
07:47:44.230 --> 07:47:44.240 align:start position:0%
in doing that with one hand while we
 
07:47:46.070 --> 07:47:46.080 align:start position:0%
have people complain about their
 
07:47:48.388 --> 07:47:48.398 align:start position:0%
property taxes
 
07:47:48.398 --> 07:47:50.070 align:start position:0%
property taxes
seems

07:47:50.070 --> 07:47:50.080 align:start position:0%
seems
 
07:47:52.230 --> 07:47:52.240 align:start position:0%
ridiculous to me but i'll let you make
 
07:47:54.708 --> 07:47:54.718 align:start position:0%
your own judgment on it in any event
 
07:47:56.948 --> 07:47:56.958 align:start position:0%
this grants a cost of living increase
 
07:47:58.468 --> 07:47:58.478 align:start position:0%
one time
 
07:48:01.430 --> 07:48:01.440 align:start position:0%
and pays for it and that's makes
 
07:48:03.910 --> 07:48:03.920 align:start position:0%
what it does
 
07:48:05.110 --> 07:48:05.120 align:start position:0%

the
 
07:50:00.388 --> 07:50:00.398 align:start position:0%
just a just a quick reminder you know
 
07:50:01.780 --> 07:50:01.790 align:start position:0%
one of the things that um
 
07:50:01.790 --> 07:50:04.150 align:start position:0%
one of the things that um
[Music]

07:50:04.150 --> 07:50:04.160 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
07:50:06.230 --> 07:50:06.240 align:start position:0%
we to you know we have a responsibility
 
07:50:09.430 --> 07:50:09.440 align:start position:0%
of here at the state is to
 
07:50:11.670 --> 07:50:11.680 align:start position:0%
you know take care of of those that we
 
07:50:11.680 --> 07:50:12.788 align:start position:0%
you know take care of of those that we
were

07:50:12.788 --> 07:50:12.798 align:start position:0%
were
 
07:50:15.110 --> 07:50:15.120 align:start position:0%
we stewarded through their careers
 
07:50:18.628 --> 07:50:18.638 align:start position:0%
helping uh the citizens of the state and
 
07:50:20.788 --> 07:50:20.798 align:start position:0%
you know the the the
 
07:50:22.230 --> 07:50:22.240 align:start position:0%
the way we're going about doing this
 
07:50:24.230 --> 07:50:24.240 align:start position:0%
here is the most prudent one in the in
 
07:50:26.150 --> 07:50:26.160 align:start position:0%
the time that we have i think when the
 
07:50:28.230 --> 07:50:28.240 align:start position:0%
system becomes more more healthy we can
 
07:50:30.468 --> 07:50:30.478 align:start position:0%
look at other
 
07:50:32.628 --> 07:50:32.638 align:start position:0%
other ways to handle our cost of living
 
07:50:33.830 --> 07:50:33.840 align:start position:0%
look at
 
07:50:35.190 --> 07:50:35.200 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
07:50:37.270 --> 07:50:37.280 align:start position:0%
but certainly um
 
07:50:38.830 --> 07:50:38.840 align:start position:0%
you know
 
07:50:42.150 --> 07:50:42.160 align:start position:0%
when the budget is has the surplus that
 
07:50:44.230 --> 07:50:44.240 align:start position:0%
it does and in the uh
 
07:50:44.240 --> 07:50:45.590 align:start position:0%
it does and in the uh
certain

07:50:45.590 --> 07:50:45.600 align:start position:0%
certain
 
07:50:47.510 --> 07:50:47.520 align:start position:0%
uh inflationary
 
07:50:49.590 --> 07:50:49.600 align:start position:0%
strains that retirees are feeling right
 
07:50:52.310 --> 07:50:52.320 align:start position:0%
now i think this is uh
 
07:50:54.788 --> 07:50:54.798 align:start position:0%
this is prudent it's fair
 
07:50:57.510 --> 07:50:57.520 align:start position:0%
it's uh frankly it's it's only about 450
 
07:51:00.948 --> 07:51:00.958 align:start position:0%
bucks per person so it's their medical
 
07:51:03.030 --> 07:51:03.040 align:start position:0%
uh expenses are gonna
 
07:51:04.948 --> 07:51:04.958 align:start position:0%
suck that up real fast but
 
07:51:07.270 --> 07:51:07.280 align:start position:0%
um you know this is this is the way that
 
07:51:09.990 --> 07:51:10.000 align:start position:0%
it should be done in in uh where it
 
07:51:10.000 --> 07:51:10.948 align:start position:0%
it should be done in in uh where it
doesn't

07:51:10.948 --> 07:51:10.958 align:start position:0%
doesn't
 
07:51:13.110 --> 07:51:13.120 align:start position:0%
increase the unfunded liability it
 
07:51:14.548 --> 07:51:14.558 align:start position:0%
doesn't get downshifted we just we
 
07:51:15.750 --> 07:51:15.760 align:start position:0%
handle it and take care of it as a
 
07:51:17.910 --> 07:51:17.920 align:start position:0%
legislature um
 
07:51:19.910 --> 07:51:19.920 align:start position:0%
all at once so this is this is the good
 
07:51:22.468 --> 07:51:22.478 align:start position:0%
formula i like it and i encourage all of
 
07:51:26.628 --> 07:51:26.638 align:start position:0%

okay then we have
 
07:53:18.830 --> 07:53:18.840 align:start position:0%
house bill
 
07:53:18.840 --> 07:53:20.548 align:start position:0%
house bill
1566

07:53:20.548 --> 07:53:20.558 align:start position:0%
1566
 
07:53:22.628 --> 07:53:22.638 align:start position:0%
representative allegro you have a motion
 
07:53:25.750 --> 07:53:25.760 align:start position:0%
yes i would like to move hb 1566 to
 
07:53:29.190 --> 07:53:29.200 align:start position:0%
interim study
 
07:53:31.510 --> 07:53:31.520 align:start position:0%
is there a second
 
07:53:32.868 --> 07:53:32.878 align:start position:0%
i'll second that
 
07:53:32.878 --> 07:53:33.830 align:start position:0%
i'll second that
okay

07:53:33.830 --> 07:53:33.840 align:start position:0%
okay
 
07:53:36.788 --> 07:53:36.798 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry madam chair is it to the is
 
07:53:36.798 --> 07:53:37.830 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry madam chair is it to the is
the

07:53:37.830 --> 07:53:37.840 align:start position:0%
the
 
07:53:41.910 --> 07:53:41.920 align:start position:0%
motion to move the bill to interim study
 
07:53:46.548 --> 07:53:46.558 align:start position:0%
 
07:53:46.558 --> 07:53:47.750 align:start position:0%
 
allegra

07:53:47.750 --> 07:53:47.760 align:start position:0%
allegra
 
07:53:50.388 --> 07:53:50.398 align:start position:0%
well after that hearing we have an awful
 
07:53:52.230 --> 07:53:52.240 align:start position:0%
lot to digest and if there was ever a
 
07:53:52.240 --> 07:53:53.590 align:start position:0%
lot to digest and if there was ever a
bill

07:53:53.590 --> 07:53:53.600 align:start position:0%
bill
 
07:53:55.430 --> 07:53:55.440 align:start position:0%
that required interim study i think this
 
07:53:56.788 --> 07:53:56.798 align:start position:0%
is the one
 
07:53:58.548 --> 07:53:58.558 align:start position:0%
also i believe there's um
 
07:54:00.788 --> 07:54:00.798 align:start position:0%
still some debate and uncertainty
 
07:54:02.070 --> 07:54:02.080 align:start position:0%
things to be hashed out over the
 
07:54:04.070 --> 07:54:04.080 align:start position:0%
prescription drug affordability
 
07:54:06.310 --> 07:54:06.320 align:start position:0%
board and i think it was that that part
 
07:54:09.990 --> 07:54:10.000 align:start position:0%
of the debate would benefit as well
 
07:54:11.590 --> 07:54:11.600 align:start position:0%
representative pearson
 
07:54:13.990 --> 07:54:14.000 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
07:54:15.430 --> 07:54:15.440 align:start position:0%
i agree with representative allegro
 
07:54:17.590 --> 07:54:17.600 align:start position:0%
there was there was a lot going on here
 
07:54:17.600 --> 07:54:19.190 align:start position:0%
there was there was a lot going on here
and

07:54:19.190 --> 07:54:19.200 align:start position:0%
and
 
07:54:22.468 --> 07:54:22.478 align:start position:0%
i think that you know the
 
07:54:24.788 --> 07:54:24.798 align:start position:0%
the intent here of this board is good
 
07:54:27.510 --> 07:54:27.520 align:start position:0%
the the idea is good it's it's a it's
 
07:54:29.030 --> 07:54:29.040 align:start position:0%
the largest
 
07:54:32.310 --> 07:54:32.320 align:start position:0%
stressor and strain on our retirees
 
07:54:32.320 --> 07:54:33.190 align:start position:0%
stressor and strain on our retirees
and

07:54:33.190 --> 07:54:33.200 align:start position:0%
and
 
07:54:34.788 --> 07:54:34.798 align:start position:0%
i think um
 
07:54:35.990 --> 07:54:36.000 align:start position:0%
you know
 
07:54:38.150 --> 07:54:38.160 align:start position:0%
taking a scalpel to this and and digging
 
07:54:39.750 --> 07:54:39.760 align:start position:0%
deep and and tweaking some things and
 
07:54:40.948 --> 07:54:40.958 align:start position:0%
looking at
 
07:54:43.270 --> 07:54:43.280 align:start position:0%
at this at the interim study level is
 
07:54:43.280 --> 07:54:44.388 align:start position:0%
at this at the interim study level is
appropriate

07:54:44.388 --> 07:54:44.398 align:start position:0%
appropriate
 
07:54:44.398 --> 07:54:45.750 align:start position:0%
appropriate
um

07:54:45.750 --> 07:54:45.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:54:47.510 --> 07:54:47.520 align:start position:0%
rather than just
 
07:54:50.468 --> 07:54:50.478 align:start position:0%
you know the the machete approach so
 
07:54:52.628 --> 07:54:52.638 align:start position:0%
i think this is this is a
 
07:54:54.708 --> 07:54:54.718 align:start position:0%
a clear case of interim studies being
 
07:54:57.030 --> 07:54:57.040 align:start position:0%
necessary and uh
 
07:54:58.468 --> 07:54:58.478 align:start position:0%
and i hope you don't put me on it thank
 
07:54:58.478 --> 07:55:01.270 align:start position:0%
and i hope you don't put me on it thank
you

07:55:01.270 --> 07:55:01.280 align:start position:0%
 
07:55:04.070 --> 07:55:04.080 align:start position:0%
ah thank you i love the heartfelt
 
07:55:06.150 --> 07:55:06.160 align:start position:0%
enthusiasm representative schmidt you
 
07:55:07.750 --> 07:55:07.760 align:start position:0%
had a question or comment
 
07:55:09.590 --> 07:55:09.600 align:start position:0%
i do madam chair so
 
07:55:11.510 --> 07:55:11.520 align:start position:0%
uh let the record reflect uh for the
 
07:55:13.750 --> 07:55:13.760 align:start position:0%
first time maybe ever i
 
07:55:15.990 --> 07:55:16.000 align:start position:0%
say amen to representative allegro's
 
07:55:19.670 --> 07:55:19.680 align:start position:0%
remarks uh because this is a heavy lift
 
07:55:19.680 --> 07:55:20.708 align:start position:0%
remarks uh because this is a heavy lift
and

07:55:20.708 --> 07:55:20.718 align:start position:0%
and
 
07:55:22.788 --> 07:55:22.798 align:start position:0%
we've got to get the facts straight for
 
07:55:24.468 --> 07:55:24.478 align:start position:0%
and know what we're talking about before
 
07:55:27.750 --> 07:55:27.760 align:start position:0%
we vote this out thank you
 
07:55:30.388 --> 07:55:30.398 align:start position:0%
thank you i i agree with you myself it
 
07:55:32.388 --> 07:55:32.398 align:start position:0%
the the bill had
 
07:55:35.110 --> 07:55:35.120 align:start position:0%
a number of issues and i'm certainly not
 
07:55:37.110 --> 07:55:37.120 align:start position:0%
willing to pass it but it deserves
 
07:55:39.270 --> 07:55:39.280 align:start position:0%
another look representative rhodes and
 
07:55:40.388 --> 07:55:40.398 align:start position:0%
then goalie
 
07:55:43.510 --> 07:55:43.520 align:start position:0%
 
07:55:46.310 --> 07:55:46.320 align:start position:0%
as far as interim study i i really hope
 
07:55:48.388 --> 07:55:48.398 align:start position:0%
i'm not on the on the study committee
 
07:55:48.398 --> 07:55:50.070 align:start position:0%
i'm not on the on the study committee
because

07:55:50.070 --> 07:55:50.080 align:start position:0%
because
 
07:55:53.510 --> 07:55:53.520 align:start position:0%
as far as is navigating this ship i i
 
07:55:54.948 --> 07:55:54.958 align:start position:0%
don't know that this really belongs even
 
07:55:57.030 --> 07:55:57.040 align:start position:0%
in our wheelhouse i understand it does
 
07:55:58.788 --> 07:55:58.798 align:start position:0%
it says board but
 
07:56:00.388 --> 07:56:00.398 align:start position:0%
i feel like i'm i've drowned at the
 
07:56:03.270 --> 07:56:03.280 align:start position:0%
bottom of the wave pool and i
 
07:56:05.910 --> 07:56:05.920 align:start position:0%
i just don't don't know that we that our
 
07:56:07.430 --> 07:56:07.440 align:start position:0%
group of people is some of the great
 
07:56:09.350 --> 07:56:09.360 align:start position:0%
things that we've we've been able to
 
07:56:11.190 --> 07:56:11.200 align:start position:0%
pass out of this committee together if
 
07:56:12.788 --> 07:56:12.798 align:start position:0%
this is one of them that that we should
 
07:56:14.868 --> 07:56:14.878 align:start position:0%
be the ones discussing so
 
07:56:17.270 --> 07:56:17.280 align:start position:0%
um please
 
07:56:19.670 --> 07:56:19.680 align:start position:0%
don't thank you
 
07:56:23.830 --> 07:56:23.840 align:start position:0%
 
07:56:26.310 --> 07:56:26.320 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and i was
 
07:56:28.310 --> 07:56:28.320 align:start position:0%
just had my thunder stole from me about
 
07:56:31.350 --> 07:56:31.360 align:start position:0%
my concern as to
 
07:56:33.510 --> 07:56:33.520 align:start position:0%
this being the appropriate committee to
 
07:56:35.990 --> 07:56:36.000 align:start position:0%
interim study this um
 
07:56:37.750 --> 07:56:37.760 align:start position:0%
looking back at where the bill came from
 
07:56:40.628 --> 07:56:40.638 align:start position:0%
 
07:56:40.638 --> 07:56:42.548 align:start position:0%
 
commerce

07:56:42.548 --> 07:56:42.558 align:start position:0%
commerce
 
07:56:42.558 --> 07:56:44.628 align:start position:0%
commerce
and

07:56:44.628 --> 07:56:44.638 align:start position:0%
and
 
07:56:48.388 --> 07:56:48.398 align:start position:0%
it seems like it's more of their purview
 
07:56:51.110 --> 07:56:51.120 align:start position:0%
than it would be for us um i know
 
07:56:53.430 --> 07:56:53.440 align:start position:0%
listening to all the details i think
 
07:56:55.190 --> 07:56:55.200 align:start position:0%
maybe one of the few people here that
 
07:56:57.350 --> 07:56:57.360 align:start position:0%
understands it is representative marsh
 
07:57:00.310 --> 07:57:00.320 align:start position:0%
but i was getting lost in
 
07:57:04.070 --> 07:57:04.080 align:start position:0%
all the weeds as to what was going on
 
07:57:05.750 --> 07:57:05.760 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure
 
07:57:09.270 --> 07:57:09.280 align:start position:0%
what i'm going to do but i
 
07:57:11.830 --> 07:57:11.840 align:start position:0%
i worry about interim study
 
07:57:13.350 --> 07:57:13.360 align:start position:0%
it sounds like the board's in place in
 
07:57:15.430 --> 07:57:15.440 align:start position:0%
doing what they want and a lot of
 
07:57:17.910 --> 07:57:17.920 align:start position:0%
organizations that are following them
 
07:57:19.670 --> 07:57:19.680 align:start position:0%
seem to think they're doing the
 
07:57:21.270 --> 07:57:21.280 align:start position:0%
appropriate thing
 
07:57:22.628 --> 07:57:22.638 align:start position:0%
going forward
 
07:57:24.830 --> 07:57:24.840 align:start position:0%
they were here today testifying in favor
 
07:57:26.868 --> 07:57:26.878 align:start position:0%
so i'm
 
07:57:29.190 --> 07:57:29.200 align:start position:0%
inclined to support those organizations
 
07:57:31.270 --> 07:57:31.280 align:start position:0%
and continue this board going forward
 
07:57:33.830 --> 07:57:33.840 align:start position:0%
thank you well interim study would not
 
07:57:35.990 --> 07:57:36.000 align:start position:0%
interfere with the board there are they
 
07:57:37.430 --> 07:57:37.440 align:start position:0%
it exists
 
07:57:39.190 --> 07:57:39.200 align:start position:0%
it would continue
 
07:57:40.548 --> 07:57:40.558 align:start position:0%
we couldn't e
 
07:57:43.590 --> 07:57:43.600 align:start position:0%
we won't even pass legislation this year
 
07:57:45.750 --> 07:57:45.760 align:start position:0%
it would be looking
 
07:57:48.468 --> 07:57:48.478 align:start position:0%
we would be looking at the original bill
 
07:57:49.830 --> 07:57:49.840 align:start position:0%
which was
 
07:57:52.468 --> 07:57:52.478 align:start position:0%
their hiring authority and this position
 
07:57:54.868 --> 07:57:54.878 align:start position:0%
they were trying to create
 
07:57:55.910 --> 07:57:55.920 align:start position:0%
which is
 
07:57:58.070 --> 07:57:58.080 align:start position:0%
something we understand we could just
 
07:57:58.080 --> 07:57:58.948 align:start position:0%
something we understand we could just
assume

07:57:58.948 --> 07:57:58.958 align:start position:0%
assume
 
07:58:00.788 --> 07:58:00.798 align:start position:0%
they're good we know what they want to
 
07:58:03.030 --> 07:58:03.040 align:start position:0%
do they want to lower prices
 
07:58:05.030 --> 07:58:05.040 align:start position:0%
they're the experts we're just looking
 
07:58:07.670 --> 07:58:07.680 align:start position:0%
at their process and their organization
 
07:58:11.270 --> 07:58:11.280 align:start position:0%
which is something we do know how to do
 
07:58:13.190 --> 07:58:13.200 align:start position:0%
representative lackas thank you yeah i
 
07:58:15.030 --> 07:58:15.040 align:start position:0%
still have some serious concerns about
 
07:58:16.948 --> 07:58:16.958 align:start position:0%
the board but i'm i'm willing to accept
 
07:58:18.868 --> 07:58:18.878 align:start position:0%
interim study because it is
 
07:58:21.030 --> 07:58:21.040 align:start position:0%
even more complicated than
 
07:58:22.628 --> 07:58:22.638 align:start position:0%
than i understood it to be
 
07:58:22.638 --> 07:58:23.670 align:start position:0%
than i understood it to be
thanks

07:58:23.670 --> 07:58:23.680 align:start position:0%
thanks
 
07:58:26.788 --> 07:58:26.798 align:start position:0%
okay representative scitec
 
07:58:29.270 --> 07:58:29.280 align:start position:0%
this is a very disturbing bill for me
 
07:58:29.280 --> 07:58:31.030 align:start position:0%
this is a very disturbing bill for me
because

07:58:31.030 --> 07:58:31.040 align:start position:0%
because
 
07:58:32.868 --> 07:58:32.878 align:start position:0%
nothing to do with the merits of it i
 
07:58:36.310 --> 07:58:36.320 align:start position:0%
heard many people whom i respect
 
07:58:38.788 --> 07:58:38.798 align:start position:0%
saying different things
 
07:58:40.948 --> 07:58:40.958 align:start position:0%
i have 20 or 30 questions i'd like to
 
07:58:43.510 --> 07:58:43.520 align:start position:0%
ask and i accept your thanks for not
 
07:58:45.190 --> 07:58:45.200 align:start position:0%
asking them
 
07:58:47.590 --> 07:58:47.600 align:start position:0%
but when i i don't want to get into the
 
07:58:49.990 --> 07:58:50.000 align:start position:0%
particulars and i'm sure there's a way
 
07:58:52.230 --> 07:58:52.240 align:start position:0%
that one will explain you
 
07:58:55.910 --> 07:58:55.920 align:start position:0%
these people are all skilled but it just
 
07:58:57.510 --> 07:58:57.520 align:start position:0%
there's some
 
07:59:00.070 --> 07:59:00.080 align:start position:0%
 
07:59:01.590 --> 07:59:01.600 align:start position:0%
thank you representative marsh and then
 
07:59:01.600 --> 07:59:02.788 align:start position:0%
thank you representative marsh and then
shut

07:59:02.788 --> 07:59:02.798 align:start position:0%
shut
 
07:59:04.868 --> 07:59:04.878 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair uh
 
07:59:08.150 --> 07:59:08.160 align:start position:0%
this this uh i i think i can ultimately
 
07:59:10.150 --> 07:59:10.160 align:start position:0%
vote for interim study because i believe
 
07:59:11.830 --> 07:59:11.840 align:start position:0%
this will not end up being a true
 
07:59:13.910 --> 07:59:13.920 align:start position:0%
interim study by this committee the
 
07:59:16.070 --> 07:59:16.080 align:start position:0%
underlying bill is to fix some technical
 
07:59:17.350 --> 07:59:17.360 align:start position:0%
issues with the board that the board
 
07:59:19.270 --> 07:59:19.280 align:start position:0%
needs to move forward for instance
 
07:59:20.788 --> 07:59:20.798 align:start position:0%
without approving the budget line they
 
07:59:22.070 --> 07:59:22.080 align:start position:0%
can't collect the fees to pay the
 
07:59:23.750 --> 07:59:23.760 align:start position:0%
director which they need to hire in
 
07:59:25.190 --> 07:59:25.200 align:start position:0%
order to do their work
 
07:59:28.070 --> 07:59:28.080 align:start position:0%
however i do understand that that
 
07:59:30.070 --> 07:59:30.080 align:start position:0%
language will likely come back to us in
 
07:59:31.750 --> 07:59:31.760 align:start position:0%
one form or another attached to some
 
07:59:33.270 --> 07:59:33.280 align:start position:0%
other bill because i already know people
 
07:59:35.190 --> 07:59:35.200 align:start position:0%
are talking about doing that
 
07:59:37.350 --> 07:59:37.360 align:start position:0%
so i i think at the end of the day the
 
07:59:39.190 --> 07:59:39.200 align:start position:0%
any interim study by this committee will
 
07:59:40.788 --> 07:59:40.798 align:start position:0%
become moot
 
07:59:43.190 --> 07:59:43.200 align:start position:0%
and therefore i can vote for a term
 
07:59:46.070 --> 07:59:46.080 align:start position:0%
study today
 
07:59:48.070 --> 07:59:48.080 align:start position:0%
you for that encouraging remark
 
07:59:49.670 --> 07:59:49.680 align:start position:0%
representative schuett
 
07:59:52.070 --> 07:59:52.080 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um
 
07:59:54.788 --> 07:59:54.798 align:start position:0%
would it be proper madam chair if if
 
07:59:57.510 --> 07:59:57.520 align:start position:0%
interim study is passed by the house
 
07:59:59.750 --> 07:59:59.760 align:start position:0%
to at least invite members of the
 
08:00:01.910 --> 08:00:01.920 align:start position:0%
commerce committee
 
08:00:03.670 --> 08:00:03.680 align:start position:0%
or a group
 
08:00:05.670 --> 08:00:05.680 align:start position:0%
to help us and i think that if we are
 
08:00:07.350 --> 08:00:07.360 align:start position:0%
getting into the details of what the
 
08:00:09.110 --> 08:00:09.120 align:start position:0%
board is doing we might want to invite
 
08:00:11.590 --> 08:00:11.600 align:start position:0%
health and human services as well yes i
 
08:00:13.590 --> 08:00:13.600 align:start position:0%
think that would be reasonable thank you
 
08:00:16.310 --> 08:00:16.320 align:start position:0%
and and just one other comment i i would
 
08:00:16.320 --> 08:00:17.350 align:start position:0%
and and just one other comment i i would
um

08:00:17.350 --> 08:00:17.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
08:00:19.430 --> 08:00:19.440 align:start position:0%
remind representative rhodes that while
 
08:00:21.350 --> 08:00:21.360 align:start position:0%
this bill may be looked at but at a
 
08:00:23.510 --> 08:00:23.520 align:start position:0%
subcommittee in the long run our whole
 
08:00:25.910 --> 08:00:25.920 align:start position:0%
committee does interim study
 
08:00:28.548 --> 08:00:28.558 align:start position:0%
so she's not excused
 
08:00:29.910 --> 08:00:29.920 align:start position:0%
we will all learn more about
 
08:00:31.910 --> 08:00:31.920 align:start position:0%
prescription drug pricing than we really
 
08:00:34.788 --> 08:00:34.798 align:start position:0%
want to know sorry about that guys i can
 
08:00:36.788 --> 08:00:36.798 align:start position:0%
tell you the story of the slaughterhouse
 
08:00:40.628 --> 08:00:40.638 align:start position:0%
bills we had 10 12 years ago
 
08:00:43.350 --> 08:00:43.360 align:start position:0%
but i won't any other questions or
 
08:00:43.360 --> 08:00:44.468 align:start position:0%
but i won't any other questions or
comments

08:00:44.468 --> 08:00:44.478 align:start position:0%
comments
 
08:00:46.070 --> 08:00:46.080 align:start position:0%
representative schmidt
 
08:00:48.230 --> 08:00:48.240 align:start position:0%
well i think probably a couple of us are
 
08:00:50.948 --> 08:00:50.958 align:start position:0%
on medicare already in this committee
 
08:00:52.548 --> 08:00:52.558 align:start position:0%
but as somebody who's been on medicare
 
08:00:54.708 --> 08:00:54.718 align:start position:0%
for a long time it's nice to having to
 
08:00:57.670 --> 08:00:57.680 align:start position:0%
have the medicare a stamp of uh
 
08:01:00.150 --> 08:01:00.160 align:start position:0%
non-approval of the amount i'm billed
 
08:01:02.788 --> 08:01:02.798 align:start position:0%
for on virtually everything i'm also on
 
08:01:05.350 --> 08:01:05.360 align:start position:0%
medicare part d and and
 
08:01:08.548 --> 08:01:08.558 align:start position:0%
so uh i'm having the big hitters
 
08:01:12.628 --> 08:01:12.638 align:start position:0%
do my drug pricing negotiation and it's
 
08:01:12.638 --> 08:01:13.590 align:start position:0%
do my drug pricing negotiation and it's
uh

08:01:13.590 --> 08:01:13.600 align:start position:0%
uh
 
08:01:16.230 --> 08:01:16.240 align:start position:0%
you heard what what dr sherman said with
 
08:01:18.548 --> 08:01:18.558 align:start position:0%
regard to how complex it is
 
08:01:20.948 --> 08:01:20.958 align:start position:0%
so i'm glad i don't have to make that
 
08:01:23.990 --> 08:01:24.000 align:start position:0%
that kind of a call every time
 
08:01:26.070 --> 08:01:26.080 align:start position:0%
okay excellent any other comments
 
08:01:29.750 --> 08:01:29.760 align:start position:0%

well that's fine yes i understand that
 
08:02:53.430 --> 08:02:53.440 align:start position:0%
the the leaders of the study committee
 
08:02:55.990 --> 08:02:56.000 align:start position:0%
will have to be care carefully selected
 
08:02:58.150 --> 08:02:58.160 align:start position:0%
among those who care
 
08:02:59.830 --> 08:02:59.840 align:start position:0%
uh but we could
 
08:03:01.430 --> 08:03:01.440 align:start position:0%
there's no reason not to put it on the
 
08:03:04.468 --> 08:03:04.478 align:start position:0%
bill on interim study on consent
 
08:03:07.510 --> 08:03:07.520 align:start position:0%

okay
 
08:03:11.190 --> 08:03:11.200 align:start position:0%
thank you very much that is the work we

had to do today
 
08:03:13.120 --> 08:03:14.150 align:start position:0%
had to do today
and

08:03:14.150 --> 08:03:14.160 align:start position:0%
and
 
08:03:26.788 --> 08:03:26.798 align:start position:0%
 
08:03:29.350 --> 08:03:29.360 align:start position:0%
i won't extend the tendency of people to
 
08:03:30.628 --> 08:03:30.638 align:start position:0%
use the
 
08:03:32.548 --> 08:03:32.558 align:start position:0%
language of sort of their heritage for
 
08:03:34.788 --> 08:03:34.798 align:start position:0%
voting because in greek
 
08:03:37.430 --> 08:03:37.440 align:start position:0%
nay means yes
 
08:03:39.750 --> 08:03:39.760 align:start position:0%
thank you that will and that'll confuse
 
08:03:39.760 --> 08:04:17.270 align:start position:0%

everybody

08:04:17.270 --> 08:04:17.280 align:start position:0%
