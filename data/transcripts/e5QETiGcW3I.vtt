.

00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Thank you.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Thank you.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Thank you.

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Thank you.

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Thank you.

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Thank you.

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Thank you.

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Thank you.

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Thank you.

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Thank you.

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Thank you.

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Thank you.

14
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Thank you.

15
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Thank you.

16
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Thank you.

17
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Thank you.

18
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Thank you.

19
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,500
I want to be here.

20
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:47,000
This could be your day to just rush out the next room and say, okay, we're done.

21
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,500
Don't we need a quorum?

22
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:53,500
Do you need a quorum for committee work?

23
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:55,500
The hearing?

24
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:59,500
It's not like we're going to executive session.

25
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:01,500
Yeah.

26
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:05,500
It's not like we're going to executive session.

27
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:07,500
You're probably right.

28
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:09,500
Your microphone's on.

29
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:12,500
How do you turn it off?

30
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:14,500
Thank you.

31
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:16,500
Thank you.

32
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:19,000
We're going to get started.

33
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:32,000
And the first bill we have is House Bill 1189, permitting voluntary donations to municipalities or the state to fund certain projects or to reduce taxation.

34
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,500
Just some information before we get started.

35
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:40,500
If you want to speak after you recognize, thank you.

36
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:42,500
All right.

37
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:52,000
If you want to speak after you recognize, you press the button, and the red light will come on.

38
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I have control of everybody's mic, so I'll.

39
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,500
With one button, I can mute everybody.

40
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:04,500
And we'll let only one person speak at a time.

41
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:18,500
I imagine there's a few more members will be coming in, but we're going to start the public hearing because it was scheduled to start at 9 o'clock.

42
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:24,500
Since the prime sponsor cannot be here, then Representative Tudor, Rockingham 1.

43
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:31,500
I'm going to be reading a prepared statement from Representative Sody from Rockingham 7.

44
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:34,000
He is out sick today.

45
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I'd like to introduce HB 1189.

46
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:49,500
This bill looks to enable and encourage voluntary funding from individuals of means or corporations for state and municipal projects and expenses, thereby reducing taxation.

47
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:55,000
These donations, I believe, are tax deductible from federal income taxes.

48
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:04,500
This, along with suitable recognition, as seen fit by the governing body, serves as motivating factors for potential donors.

49
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:16,000
Recognition would serve in much the same way as on PBS when they announced Program Z was brought to you by Y Corporation.

50
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Anyone who donated a large sum of money for the project, school bus, fire truck, can have a plaque or sign in recognition of the donation placed on the building or vehicle.

51
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:44,000
The bill also establishes the availability of making donations to the state and municipality websites, thereby serving the same role as a GoFundMe page.

52
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:50,500
I believe the bill has great potential, especially with input from the committee.

53
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:53,000
Thank you for your consideration.

54
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Representative Soty, Winnem.

55
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Representative Romney.

56
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Yeah.

57
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Did you read that this would be federally tax deductible?

58
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,500
Did I hear that right?

59
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:09,000
Is that what he's saying?

60
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,500
That's what he's saying, yes.

61
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:13,500
Okay.

62
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:16,000
We've got to double-check that.

63
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:22,000
These donations, I believe, are tax deductible from the federal income taxes.

64
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,000
And we will get a reply to that.

65
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:38,500
Anybody have questions thank you representative I have a pink card from Elliot axelman who's from hooks that representing himself in support of the bill.

66
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:41,000
Can you hear me now?

67
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Hi, my name is Elliot Axelman.

68
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I'm representing myself.

69
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,500
I'm supporting House Bill 1189.

70
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:56,500
I think it's a very simple bill in a sense, but it could also be transformational.

71
00:04:56,500 --> 00:05:03,500
It can start really eliminating the need for mandatory taxation as we know it.

72
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:06,500
But it's a very simple bill.

73
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:08,500
It allows for something.

74
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:11,000
I think it's already allowed.

75
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:28,500
The state government and town and city governments already do this, but it clarifies that it's allowed, and I think this bill would encourage the state government and town and city governments to do this.

76
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:31,000
It essentially has a program.

77
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:46,000
It clarifies a program where businesses, individuals can give money to the government, which they already can do, and it clarifies that the government should give them something in return.

78
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:52,500
So currently, we have many ways that the state government raises revenue voluntarily.

79
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:56,500
Like all people have to get revenue voluntarily.

80
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:59,500
They can't take it by force.

81
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:15,500
This kind of puts the government on a level playing field, and it says if they want to make money, they should do it voluntarily by giving something in exchange for it.

82
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:20,500
So currently we have sponsor a highway, adopt a highway.

83
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:25,500
We have the state and city governments and town governments.

84
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:30,000
They give something in exchange to people and businesses.

85
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:47,500
They give essentially advertising to businesses by sponsor a highway, by local police and fire trucks that we have throughout the state where they have a little plaque on the side of the police car.

86
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:50,000
Manchester police have seen this.

87
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:57,500
I think other towns, the buses in Nashua and Manchester do this a little bit.

88
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:00,000
The bus stops do this.

89
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
They have little advertisements.

90
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:34,000
So essentially, if I live in Hoekset and I want to get advertisement for my website or my business or anything, I can give $1,000 a month to the Hoekset Fire Department or any department or Hooks at Town Government, and I can negotiate with them to put a plaque saying sponsored by Alu's website or any business sponsored by on the fire truck.

91
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,500
So I feel I'm getting something, so I'm happy.

92
00:07:38,500 --> 00:08:12,000
The town gets something, they get money for their funding for their new fire trucks, they're happy, and the taxpayers get offset taxation by that same amount., I figure if every town can raise the amount they need for their budget and on the state level if the state can raise six billion a year, which I know they can, they can, we can eventually offset taxation.

93
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:18,500
So the state government's budget is around six billion a year right now.

94
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:28,000
We have the state government owns a few buildings, a few thousand vehicles and thousands of miles of roadways.

95
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:57,500
If they can essentially rent out or sell advertisements on what are essentially billboards, I think the state government can raise $6 billion a year ultimately in a few years with this program by having advertising because they have essentially thousands of billboards, meaning they can make $6 billion a year voluntarily by selling ads essentially to private business.

96
00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:08,500
So eventually we can make all taxation essentially into more of an advertising system and eventually offset taxation as we know it.

97
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:11,500
So I'd love to take questions.

98
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:13,500
Representative Barone.

99
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:16,000
Thank you for your testimony.

100
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Can you hear me?

101
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Okay.

102
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:33,500
So I'm going to ask the same question about, I guess, the statement that was read from the prime sponsor said that this would be tax-deductible donations.

103
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:36,000
Are we certain of that?

104
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
I have no idea.

105
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:43,000
I saw that in Julius Sodi's email, the prime sponsor.

106
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,500
He said he believes it would be.

107
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:48,500
I have no idea.

108
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:53,000
We'd have to look at the experts with taxation.

109
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,500
We'll take care of it.

110
00:09:55,500 --> 00:10:22,500
I think what he was saying was if it's considered, because right now it's not necessarily taxation, it's not really a donation to the state, if it's considered a state tax, that state taxes with the SALT, depending on the rates, might be tax deductible federally, but I'm definitely not the expert on that.

111
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:24,500
Okay, thank you.

112
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:26,500
Representative.

113
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,500
Thank you, Mr.

114
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:32,500
Chair, and welcome to Ways and Means, Representative.

115
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:39,500
Right now, there's a baseball stadium in Manchester with a corporate name on it.

116
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:42,000
So isn't this already allowed?

117
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,500
I guess the city of Manchester owns the ballpark.

118
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:52,000
Yeah, well, I know it's definitely being done a little bit.

119
00:10:52,000 --> 00:11:04,000
I saw a few months ago, Manchester police, their mounted units, so their horses and the trailer, it's set sponsored by, I think, St.

120
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Mary's Bank, a few other credit unions, and a few other businesses.

121
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:49,000
So it's already being done on the city level maybe on a state level too so it's definitely being done a little bit that's why when I spoke to the representatives crafting this bill and stuff we knew it was already happening but this bill kind of clarifies that it can happen and I think encourages the town and city governments and the state government to do this the bill also mentions they should put it on the.

122
00:11:49,000 --> 00:12:03,000
They should mention on the state government and city websites that you can donate here and we can compensate you to give you something in exchange for it.

123
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:16,000
And some might want to consider an amendment to make it mandatory for towns and cities and the state government to accept this program for advertising.

124
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Right now, the bill says they may do it if the executive wants to do it to do it um so they're that's a good interesting question if it should be mandatory or not but definitely to answer the question the cities and towns some are already doing this for sure okay thank you uh representative mulloy thank you mr chair for taking my question uh and recognizing me, and thank you for taking my question.

125
00:12:54,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Before I ask my question, I want to let you know that I spent 25 years working for public television.

126
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:17,000
And my first question is, would you believe that I think the characterization of this, comparing this to a public television kind of thing is oversimplistic.

127
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,500
Can I have a follow-up?

128
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:21,500
I'm not sure.

129
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:26,000
I think that was Representative Soty who mentioned it.

130
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:36,500
I hadn't thought of it as compared to public television, and I don't have the expertise you have in public television.

131
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:43,000
But I think I was thinking of it as advertising and using billboards.

132
00:13:43,000 --> 00:14:05,000
I'm not an expert in billboards either, but I figure the state government has how many buildings the state government owns, maybe a few dozen or a few hundred and thousands of vehicles and roadways and everything else the state owns and the websites.

133
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:14,500
That can all be rented out to advertisers to make, I would think, a substantial impact off the taxation.

134
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:18,000
So that's what I was thinking about.

135
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:28,000
But I guess TV could be a small portion of the advertising as well, as far as public access TV.

136
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:34,000
No, I'm not suggesting that it should be television involved in this.

137
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:38,500
I'm just saying, by my follow-up, may I follow-up?

138
00:14:38,500 --> 00:15:14,000
In my experience, this type of fundraising for public television amounted maybe 10% of its entire budget and I think that that I want to go on record here as asking the question do you believe really believe with that knowledge now that there would be that kind of money coming into state and local coffers that you said to the six billion I think you said would really is realistic.

139
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,500
Yeah that's a good question.

140
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:34,500
I think ultimately this is kind of a no loss no downside proposition because there's no downside the government can raise revenue if they can offset taxation on a state and local level by even 5%.

141
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:42,000
That's phenomenal for the taxpayers who are on fixed incomes who are struggling with taxes.

142
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:53,000
That being said, I do think the state government owning what are essentially thousands of billboards can make $6 billion a year.

143
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:59,500
I do think this program can eventually raise all the revenue without taxation.

144
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:06,000
Will that happen in an instant, in two days after the bill passes?

145
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Probably not.

146
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:19,500
But I think ultimately, put it this way, if I had 10,000, 50,000 billboards, I think I could raise $6 billion a year.

147
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:25,500
I don't know the exact rates, but there will be price discovery.

148
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:43,000
And as soon as this program were launched, we would have Amazon and Google and Facebook competing for that ad space on essentially digital billboards or other type alternative billboards, like the buildings and vehicles.

149
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Every state vehicle, the state probably owns thousands of vehicles, all the state police and other programs and DPW and all that.

150
00:16:54,000 --> 00:17:13,000
If you rent out, lease out every part of every vehicle with stickers and logos for Amazon, Bezos is probably willing to pay a few thousand bucks a month or a few million a month for that, right?

151
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:22,500
So I do think $6 billion could easily be reached if you have thousands of what are essentially billboards.

152
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:25,000
So does that make sense?

153
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,500
Thank you for your response.

154
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:29,500
Further questions?

155
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:31,500
Representative Janigian.

156
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:33,500
Thank you, Mr.

157
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:35,500
Chairman.

158
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:38,500
Thank you for taking my question.

159
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:45,000
I don't see anything in here that would prevent this, Thank you, Mr.

160
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Chairman.

161
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Thank you for taking my question.

162
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:58,500
I don't see anything in here that would prevent this, but I just wanted to ask you.

163
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:10,500
So if somebody makes a donation, is the government required to use that donation for the purpose that the person giving it specifies for?

164
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:27,000
Because if that's true, then I'd be concerned that people could make donations for all sorts of things that may not relate to what the state or government would be using money for.

165
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,500
Yeah, that's an excellent question.

166
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:35,500
At least to me, as written, that seems unclear in the bill.

167
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:39,000
I think Representative Soty shares that sentiment.

168
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:44,500
He said it when I spoke to him the other night.

169
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:47,000
He said it was unclear.

170
00:18:47,000 --> 00:19:00,000
And the bill says that a person can donate to the government for the reasons of offsetting taxation or a new project or something like that.

171
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:08,500
I think ultimately it would be up to the executive of that government or of that department.

172
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:15,500
And what I'm kind of imagining in this bill, again, it's kind of unprecedented.

173
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:19,500
What I'm imagining is I have a website.

174
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:27,000
I think it's a great website publication about freedom, and I want advertisement for it.

175
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:45,500
I would go to, let's say, my town government and negotiate with them and say, for $87 a month, I would like a plaque of eight inches by six inches on the fire truck for one month.

176
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:52,500
And we would negotiate and sign a contract, and then we'd go from there.

177
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:58,500
And if they didn't want to do that, we wouldn't do it.

178
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:06,500
So I'm imagining there would be kind of specific contracts for each instance of the advertising.

179
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:08,500
Thank you.

180
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:10,500
Thank you.

181
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,500
Representative Ames.

182
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:14,500
Sorry.

183
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:16,500
Hi.

184
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:22,500
I came in a little late, so I didn't catch your name.

185
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:24,500
It's Elliot Axelman.

186
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:26,500
Thank you.

187
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:42,000
So, thinking to your reference to maybe Amazon or some huge corporation would rise to this opportunity and donate significant sums of money, perhaps in return for some expected good publicity.

188
00:20:42,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Isn't there a real danger in moving down that road that you create a dependent relationship on a major corporation such that the municipality or the state finds it difficult to move forward with policy actions that Amazon or, I hate to use a particular company, that the major company doesn't really want the government to get into.

189
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:19,000
And so then you have a single private entity affecting public policy in a distorted way.

190
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Yeah, thank you.

191
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
That's an excellent question.

192
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:30,500
And I was just speaking to a few representatives before this hearing about that concern.

193
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:42,000
And that is one of the concerns that I've heard about this type of program, about private entities essentially having influence on government.

194
00:21:42,000 --> 00:22:02,500
A few things I would say in regards to that concern is currently we have obviously on-the-record lobbying, off-the-record lobbying, other donations, other cronyist contracts that federal and state government has with nepotism, with people who are close to government officials.

195
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:06,000
And that's kind of behind the scenes.

196
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:19,000
This is very transparent where everyone knows, because it's very public, and it's an advertisement of it, that a business is giving money to the government.

197
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
So it's very transparent.

198
00:22:21,000 --> 00:23:18,000
So if we're going to have a private entity giving money to a government I would much prefer it be the public so everyone knows about it but also it being used not to go to a politicians pockets but to be used to literally fund that new fire truck we need right so so on a smaller level or if Amazon does buy ads they're literally giving money to the government to be used for a program So it's not going to you know some congressman's pocket or to some foreign country Corrupt politician is going to literally helping a town with schools and fire trucks so Yeah, that's what I would say.

199
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:35,000
It's literally helping the town raise more money And it's better in public view than more kind of under the table Corrupt donations as far as lobbying or unofficial lobbying or other corrupt stuff.

200
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Representative Almey.

201
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Thank you.

202
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
I come from Lebanon.

203
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:48,500
Lebanon is right on 89, has three exits, four maybe if you count them right.

204
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:52,500
we have the center we are the center.

205
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:57,500
We are the center of a micropolis of 100,000 people.

206
00:23:57,500 --> 00:24:20,500
We have an excellent opportunity, if you did this, to buy up all the advertising that the advertisers are going to want to use and leave Hanover, which is off this system, and all of the smaller bedroom towns around us with a no revenue source.

207
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:30,000
Why would an advertiser, except a local person, want to fund the fire trucks in Canaan or in Hanover?

208
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:44,000
I'm not sure I understood the first part, but as far as the latest thing you asked, why would a bigger company want to do it, mostly local?

209
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
I don't know.

210
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:51,500
Again, I can't say for sure because this hasn't happened before.

211
00:24:51,500 --> 00:25:05,000
I would think a lot of local businesses would certainly want to help out their town and get publicity on a local level in the micro economy.

212
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:19,500
I also think I could totally see larger companies wanting to get great publicity as far as helping to fund that new fire truck and school and police department.

213
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:22,000
But also, it is advertising.

214
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,500
So they're doing calculations, right?

215
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:31,000
So Amazon and Google are doing calculations every day with their advertising budget.

216
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:39,000
So maybe Amazon spends $1 billion a year on advertising, and some of it is big.

217
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
It's on national things.

218
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:46,500
Some of it is going to be Super Bowl and YouTube.

219
00:25:46,500 --> 00:26:04,000
Some of it is going to be on local fire departments, and then they can come out with a press release saying, we're helping 400 fire departments around the United States buy new fire trucks.

220
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,500
So that's great publicity, too.

221
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:08,500
But you're right.

222
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:16,500
It's probably going to be more local, but I don't know, I can't say for sure.

223
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:34,500
But I do see this being very much local businesses wanting to get great publicity for helping their town and get actual benefit from advertising from people seeing their logo, their business and around the town.

224
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:36,500
Thank you.

225
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:40,000
Could I just have a short follow-up?

226
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
Follow-up.

227
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:54,000
Do you believe that if you went out into the smaller towns of our state, that you would not find even a gas station?

228
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
I'm not sure.

229
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
Thank you.

230
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
Representative Decette.

231
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
Thank you, Mr.

232
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
Chair.

233
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,000
Thank you for taking my question.

234
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:37,500
I kind of, in thinking about this briefly, if I read the legislation, proposed legislation correctly, it's up to the towns, the localities accept the dollars now if we had organization a offer to sponsor a police cruiser an organization B offered to sponsor a police cruiser the town decides to go with the organization A as opposed to organization B.

235
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:39,500
Whose exposure is that?

236
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:52,500
And I need not elaborate on where I'm going with this, but there are some organizations I don't want on my fire truck in my town.

237
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:56,000
So what's your thoughts on that, Elliot?

238
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,500
Yeah, that's a great question.

239
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:06,000
And I think we thought about that over the last few weeks a little bit.

240
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,500
There's a few things we could say.

241
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:12,000
And, again, that's not clear.

242
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:17,000
Right now in the legislation, it's very short, simple legislation.

243
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
It's not clear.

244
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:39,000
So on one hand, the town manager or on the state level, the governor, may choose to accept the highest bidder, and we could amend the bill, or that could just be the policy where they accept the highest bidder.

245
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:58,000
Or if it's a business you don't want to associate with because either it's for adults only or something like that, or just an organization that that government doesn't want to associate with, they could choose not to.

246
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:12,000
But on the other hand, we have to make sure there isn't too much corruption as far as going with a friend's business as far as corrupt contracts.

247
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
So that's a concern.

248
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:20,000
And again, I don't have the answer to how to remedy that.

249
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:26,000
On one hand, you could say you should accept the highest bidder.

250
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:36,500
That way, the government can get the most money for that advertisement, that limited space of advertisement on that limited billboard.

251
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:43,500
On the other hand, maybe there should be some businesses that they don't accept.

252
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:45,500
I don't know.

253
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:52,000
But that's something that could be either amended or up to each executive.

254
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:58,500
So again, a state should trust its governor to make those judgment calls.

255
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:18,000
A town should trust their town manager or a city should trust their mayor to do the right thing as far as taking the highest bidder and or taking the most appropriate business, if that makes a little sense.

256
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
Follow up, Mr.

257
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
Chair.

258
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:40,000
I'm just wondering where, if the thought process in drafting this, if, how do I say this without being offensive, if, in fact, whomever the organization, party, group, or whatever is chosen, they're the high bidder.

259
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:44,500
If there is a loss, whose exposure is that?

260
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:47,000
Is that the locality's exposure?

261
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:59,000
If there's a legal action after that, or do you think it'd be the state and the legislature's exposure in bringing this into law?

262
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:09,000
I'm not sure, and I probably couldn't answer it anyway, but what sort of legal action are you concerned with?

263
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:51,500
If, in fact, let's say an organization that has proven to be detrimental to the community, just big picture here and they come in with with the biggest bid and they put on a fire truck whatever their logo is and they caused harm to the community as opposed to another organization that does good for the community I'm just trying to think ahead of legal action we may be exposed to either as a state or as a locality in my town of Salem.

264
00:31:51,500 --> 00:32:07,000
Without invoking names of organizations, I can see organizations coming forward and wanting to buy ad space on my fire truck that I don't necessarily want ad space from that organization.

265
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:22,000
And if I don't agree with my town manager, my town manager wants to have that ad space on his fire truck, there may be some exposure for somebody there.

266
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:26,000
Yeah, I probably couldn't answer that question satisfactorily.

267
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:39,000
As far as a logo being on the side of a fire truck hurting someone, I've never heard of seeing a logo physically hurting a person.

268
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,500
But will there be lawsuits?

269
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:43,500
Yes.

270
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:54,500
Because if some, you know, I think Amazon, some people think, is not the best organization for the environment in the world.

271
00:32:54,500 --> 00:33:13,000
And if they have a logo on my police car in my town, someone in the town is going to sue and say that, you know, that is contributing to harming the environment or something like that.

272
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:16,000
And there's going to be lawsuits.

273
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:20,500
So I'm sure there have been plenty of lawsuits.

274
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:25,000
I'm sure there will be lawsuits in the future.

275
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:28,000
That I have no doubt about.

276
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:35,000
And I probably couldn't answer that perfectly as far as who would handle that.

277
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:41,000
If it's on a town level, it would probably be the town.

278
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:50,500
If this is on a state level ad, it would probably be the state as far as their lawyers.

279
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:54,500
But yeah, I probably couldn't answer that perfectly.

280
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:56,500
It's an interesting question.

281
00:33:56,500 --> 00:34:00,500
Representative Urily followed by Representative Gamalo and Abramny.

282
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:02,500
Thank you, Mr.

283
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:04,500
Chair.

284
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:06,500
Thank you, Mr.

285
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:08,500
Chair.

286
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:24,500
Following up a little bit on what Representative Doucette started down that path, let's say I'm a manufacturer of fire trucks, Rescue 1, because they're in New England, not on the Cape.

287
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:40,500
If I were Rescue 1 and I wanted Town A to buy my fire trucks, I'd be willing to give them a discount if they put Rescue 1 all over the side.

288
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:47,000
That would be considered, if done outside of this law, quid pro quo.

289
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:53,500
But with this law, are you not creating a legalized quid pro quo?

290
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:55,500
Yeah, that's certainly possible.

291
00:34:55,500 --> 00:35:04,000
And again, we'd have to speak to the exact lawyers as far as what that would create.

292
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,500
I think I understand you.

293
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:12,000
And now I think that I don't necessarily see massive downside.

294
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,500
I understand quid pro quo.

295
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:21,000
I don't see massive downside in the taxpayer saving a few million dollars.

296
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:27,000
In my town, I would love to save a few million dollars.

297
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:30,000
We just bought a fire truck.

298
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,000
It cost a few million dollars.

299
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:36,500
I think $1 million for an engine.

300
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:44,500
And if we could have gotten a discount on that, I would have been very happy.

301
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:46,500
So I understand that.

302
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:57,000
And I think some fire trucks, you know, in the ambulance business and all fire trucks, the logo is there, right?

303
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:06,500
So, for instance, almost every single ambulance in the United States, every ambulance I've been on is a Ford.

304
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:11,500
I've been on a few Chevys back in New York.

305
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:14,500
So that logo is there, right?

306
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:17,000
So they're getting free advertisement.

307
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:21,500
Ford is getting essentially free advertisement from every ambulance.

308
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:25,500
And it says Ford right there in front.

309
00:36:25,500 --> 00:37:06,000
The logo is few inches big everyone sees an ambulance they see Ford is it quid pro quo does Ford give a discount to ambulance companies I don't know but I understand you know there's some concern with nepotism quid pro quo on the other hand if there are discounts discounts are good if taxpayers are saving money so I see both sides of that ultimately I would not probably not mind erring on the side of saving taxpayers' money, right?

310
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
Follow-up.

311
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
Thank you, Mr.

312
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
Chair.

313
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:40,000
The comment I would have on that, there's a world of difference between the badge of the vehicle owner, Ford for the Ford Explorer for the police cruisers or the F-350s for the trucks, for the ambulance trucks, or Seagrave or Rescue One or whichever one happens to be manufacturing the fire truck at the time.

314
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,500
France used to make them.

315
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:53,500
That's far different from the badge logo than having it donated by or on the side of it, which says one thing.

316
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:58,500
Do you see a difference in those things or not?

317
00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:20,500
Yeah, I would agree that having a Ford, a vehicle being made by a Ford, is a little different than the vehicle being made and outfitted and then given to the town as far as a donation or a contract with them, for sure.

318
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:28,500
I think, at least, I don't know, fire trucks in the ambulance business, this already happens.

319
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:36,500
For instance, it's Ford, and then there's a company called Medix, M-E-D-I-X, that outfits the ambulances.

320
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:47,000
And that logo is on the inside, maybe the outside too, but on the inside of the ambulance, they're pretty big.

321
00:38:47,000 --> 00:39:32,500
Their logo, they're the ones who outfitted the ambulance to make it an ambulance So it's already happening a little bit again I totally understand the concern of nepotism corporatism, you know advertising selling out to private businesses on the side of your fire engines It's supposed to be public admissible and it looks like it's private or Corrupt contracts or anything like that, but as far as quid pro quo But saving taxpayers money I think is a little just a little higher on my list as far as priorities.

322
00:39:32,500 --> 00:40:15,500
If we could save taxpayers, you know, that grandma whose taxes are going up and she has to choose to pay her property tax bill or buy food for herself for the month, if we could save her a few hundred dollars that month and people have to see a logo on the side of a fire truck, I think I'd rather harm someone by making them see a logo on a fire truck than harm my grandmother by making her starve, if that makes sense.

323
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:18,500
Representative Grumato, followed by Representative Bromley.

324
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:20,500
Thank you, Mr.

325
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:22,500
Chair.

326
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:33,000
I read this a couple weeks ago, and I've perused it three or four times, and I see nothing about advertising.

327
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:40,000
I see that there can be voluntary donations made and acknowledgement on a website.

328
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:46,000
I see nothing about advertising so I'm wondering where that comes from.

329
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,500
Yeah that's a great question.

330
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:50,500
Thank you.

331
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:56,500
So I had some discussions with Representative Soty in crafting the bill.

332
00:40:56,500 --> 00:41:07,000
I thought of it as more of an advertisement bill and he was thinking of it more as a donation bill.

333
00:41:07,000 --> 00:42:14,000
But then when I read it, if you read the bill, it says acknowledgement for the donation as determined by the executive on the state level or town or city level being made essentially in concert between the donor, meaning the payer for the advertisement, and the executive, So town manager or governor so so by acknowledging for instance if I have a billboard and you were to donate money to me or give me money and I would acknowledge that by putting your business on my billboard that's essentially advertising so I know the bill it is you know interesting and I didn't write the bill it's interesting to say the word advertisement if I wrote it or I were OLS, I probably would have put the word advertisement in there for sure.

334
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:35,500
But by giving money and acknowledging that someone is a donor, by giving them either a plaque in a hospital or on a park bench or a bigger billboard type thing, I think that satisfies that it is an advertisement type of program.

335
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:37,500
Representative Brownlee.

336
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:39,500
Thank you, Mr.

337
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:41,500
Chair.

338
00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:45,000
Yeah, thanks again for taking my question.

339
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:49,000
Yeah, I was going to bring this up.

340
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,500
It's actually line 16, everybody.

341
00:42:51,500 --> 00:42:59,000
It says the governing body may approve suitable recognition of donations as they see fit.

342
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:07,000
So I guess you're interpreting that as if the town wants to advertise, they can advertise.

343
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:28,500
Yeah, and what I'm hoping that does is I'm hoping that kind of makes like a contract where if I give you money, either I trust you or we have some kind of contract where I'm going to give you $1,000 a month.

344
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:39,000
I'm hoping you will put my website logo on the side of your fire trucks and police cars as I requested.

345
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:46,000
So that's not 100% clear, but I'm hoping that's kind of where it goes.

346
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:56,000
I'd like you, but I'm not going to give you $1,000 a month if I don't get anything in return.

347
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,500
So that's what I'm hoping.

348
00:43:58,500 --> 00:44:07,000
So it's not unheard of of quasi-public entities like the Metropolitan Transit Authority in New York City.

349
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:11,500
They put placards up on their subway cars, etc.

350
00:44:11,500 --> 00:44:15,500
But I'm not too thrilled with this idea.

351
00:44:15,500 --> 00:44:20,500
How would you feel if that line, 16, is eliminated?

352
00:44:20,500 --> 00:44:25,500
Most of this conversation has been around the advertising part.

353
00:44:25,500 --> 00:44:32,500
And, you know, it's up to the committee how we all feel about that.

354
00:44:32,500 --> 00:44:43,500
But the essence of the bill would still be there if people want to donate to the town or to the state.

355
00:44:43,500 --> 00:45:14,500
But I could see problems, too, in terms of you can upset somebody if you're advertising one product versus another product on a town or a state property so I just need you to react to that if we were to edit that out and amend that out would it how much damage would it do to the bill in your mind?

356
00:45:14,500 --> 00:45:18,000
Cutting out line 16 says what exactly?

357
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:26,000
Line 16 says, the governing body may approve suitable recognition of donations as they see fit.

358
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:32,000
And that's the only line that seems to kind of imply advertising.

359
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
Yeah.

360
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:37,500
Because there's nothing in here about advertising.

361
00:45:37,500 --> 00:45:39,500
That's the only line.

362
00:45:39,500 --> 00:45:41,500
Yeah.

363
00:45:41,500 --> 00:45:51,000
Well, without that line, I don't know how many people will donate to the state government and towns, right?

364
00:45:51,000 --> 00:46:13,000
So as much as people may love you, if they're not going to get recognition for it, meaning advertisement, I'm not going to be giving you a few million dollars of my hard-earned money if I'm not going to get anything in return, right?

365
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:17,500
So, you know, people, you know, it's very simple.

366
00:46:17,500 --> 00:46:21,500
People do things in exchange for other things.

367
00:46:21,500 --> 00:46:23,500
It's just transaction, right?

368
00:46:23,500 --> 00:46:30,500
There are people who donate things to charities and sometimes get recognition, sometimes don't.

369
00:46:30,500 --> 00:46:44,000
But as far as anonymous donors to charities or government, which, you know, people are a little more sympathetic to various charities than they are to government.

370
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:51,500
So without recognition as far as advertisement, that's what I think makes this bill special.

371
00:46:51,500 --> 00:46:58,000
When I said the state government can raise $6 billion, I wasn't joking.

372
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
I wasn't exaggerating.

373
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:07,000
They can if they give people reason to donate six billion a year, right?

374
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:18,000
If you give someone a reason to give you money by giving them a product or a service, they'll give you money.

375
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:34,000
If you don't, if I don't offer anything and I ask for money, I'm probably going to get very little money if I just ask for money and give nothing in return.

376
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:38,000
So I think that's what makes this bill.

377
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:47,500
And you also mentioned that if a town accepts one bid and doesn't the other, someone could be offended.

378
00:47:47,500 --> 00:47:49,500
And that's true.

379
00:47:49,500 --> 00:47:51,500
Someone could be offended.

380
00:47:51,500 --> 00:48:11,000
And that's why there will be price discovery by bidding and the price will be bid up, which is a good thing because the town will get more money by willing payers without taking money by forced by taxation.

381
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:50,500
If I bid $100, Amazon bids $150, I bid $200, the town just got $200 it's it's it's it's bidding so it's I forget the word for yes it's a bidding up the price essentially so that's I think it's a good thing if the town is getting more money so if there's competition that's a good thing even if someone might be offended if they lose if they lose that I think I think you made your point.

382
00:48:50,500 --> 00:48:52,500
Thank you.

383
00:48:52,500 --> 00:48:54,500
Thank you.

384
00:48:54,500 --> 00:48:56,500
Any further questions?

385
00:48:56,500 --> 00:48:59,000
We have a couple more.

386
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,000
Representative Janine.

387
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,000
Thank you, Mr.

388
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,000
Chairman.

389
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,000
Just a quick question.

390
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:17,000
I agree with Representative Abrami that line 16 does seem to be where most of the controversy in this is.

391
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:27,500
And if that was taken out, it may decrease donations a little bit, but the donator or the person Thank you.

392
00:49:27,500 --> 00:49:44,000
most of the controversy in this is, and if that was taken out, it may decrease donations a little bit, but the donator or the person making a donation still has the website.

393
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:59,500
And there'll be a, people will begin to learn in town and states that if I want to see who's funding certain things, they still have the website to go through.

394
00:49:59,500 --> 00:50:11,500
So I think the website ends up being a less, you know, there will be people offended by various organizations they don't agree with.

395
00:50:11,500 --> 00:50:22,000
But on the website, I think that, would you believe, I think that would probably not be as big a deal.

396
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:34,000
Yes, I think that part, so line 16 is the controversial part of the bill, but it's also, it makes the bill a bill.

397
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:37,500
Without it, it would be essentially neutered.

398
00:50:37,500 --> 00:50:39,500
It wouldn't do anything.

399
00:50:39,500 --> 00:50:57,000
So the bill essentially allows the government to raise money, because right now, I'm sure you guys know this, in the Liffordie State, there are hundreds of thousands of people who don't like paying taxes.

400
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:01,000
They want to pay little to no taxes.

401
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:22,000
And this bill would make them all very happy because it would start the process of explaining and clarifying that the government and encouraging the government to raise money voluntarily, without force, without taxation, voluntarily raising money by offering something in return.

402
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:31,000
And there is something the government can offer in return is they already have all this real estate.

403
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:44,500
We have the LOB, we have the state house and tons of buildings and vehicles and the roads and like you said, websites are digital billboards essentially.

404
00:51:44,500 --> 00:51:48,000
There's a lot of advertising on websites.

405
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:57,500
If they were recognized on the website, yes, that would be worth like three dollars to me a month.

406
00:51:57,500 --> 00:52:02,500
I'm just thinking myself for my small business, my publication.

407
00:52:02,500 --> 00:52:15,500
I would donate around three dollars maybe a month to the state if I were recognized in a small part of the website saying I donated.

408
00:52:15,500 --> 00:52:38,000
If you were to put my logo of my big beautiful website, Liberty Block, on the side of the LOB, if it's a 10 foot by 5 foot poster, I would probably pay a few hundred or a few thousand dollars a month for that.

409
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:41,500
And the bids go up from there.

410
00:52:41,500 --> 00:53:09,500
So, you know, a bigger company with more money, my advertising budget is not very big, it's a few dollars, but a bigger company that's going to spend billions a year, if you really give them a reason to give you money by giving them ad space, then they might give millions or billions a year.

411
00:53:09,500 --> 00:53:14,000
So I think that's what makes it a bill.

412
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:22,000
I understand it's controversial, and that's the sticking point for everyone here, and I understand that.

413
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:27,000
But without line 16, the bill doesn't really do anything.

414
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,000
Thank you.

415
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,000
Any further questions?

416
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:33,000
And no further questions.

417
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,500
Thank you for your testimony.

418
00:53:35,500 --> 00:53:37,500
Thank you very much.

419
00:53:37,500 --> 00:53:45,500
Next, we have Russon Chester from Bedford, New Hampshire, in support of the bill, representing himself.

420
00:53:45,500 --> 00:53:47,500
Russin.

421
00:53:47,500 --> 00:53:49,500
No worries.

422
00:53:49,500 --> 00:53:51,500
I'm sorry.

423
00:53:51,500 --> 00:53:53,500
No worries.

424
00:53:53,500 --> 00:53:56,000
It's the first time ever.

425
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,000
Dad's name's Russell.

426
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,000
Mother's name's Sandra.

427
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:04,500
Born in the 60s here in Concord, New Hampshire.

428
00:54:04,500 --> 00:54:06,500
Well, welcome aboard.

429
00:54:06,500 --> 00:54:08,500
Thank you.

430
00:54:08,500 --> 00:54:12,500
I am here in support of this bill.

431
00:54:12,500 --> 00:54:54,500
I recently became a lot more aware of the monies that are going to my tax dollars that are going to all these different programs some of which I approve of some of which I don't both on a state level local level state level and federal level so the bottom line is is this bill just takes that money from out from under to put it out there where people say well, they obviously are being paid to put that on their thing.

432
00:54:54,500 --> 00:54:59,000
I mean, liken this bill to the car dealerships.

433
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:09,500
When you go to a car dealership and you buy a car, they put their little logo right on the side.

434
00:55:09,500 --> 00:55:13,000
Everybody knows where you bought that car.

435
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:16,000
Free advertisement for that car company.

436
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:54,500
And hopefully you got a good deal from the salesman so that people will you know there'll be conversations about that speak a little bit about I'm going to use Amazon no no offense but I know a lot about the Amazon situation with Hookset and for instance there are a lot of people that were really not comfortable with the amount of, with Amazon being able to go into the old skating rink facility in Hookset.

437
00:55:54,500 --> 00:55:59,000
A lot of people were really uncomfortable with that.

438
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:09,000
They felt that there was some unhandedness about monies being passed to the people in power to get that approved.

439
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:13,500
And this bill would take that power away too.

440
00:56:13,500 --> 00:56:20,000
So the way I feel about this bill is it's much more transparent.

441
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,000
It allows for transparency.

442
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:42,000
For instance, we have a House of Representatives person right now who almost $90,000 of his $200,000 campaign fund, $90,000 that came from big pharmaceutical and medical agencies, and he is the one that's supporting all of these vaccine mandates.

443
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:48,000
You have a lot of people that are very upset about that.

444
00:56:48,000 --> 00:57:07,500
So if we pass this type of bill, we're saying we are, we, the state of New Hampshire, agrees to be a more transparent government for our people, and we understand that people may be upset about our choices.

445
00:57:07,500 --> 00:57:13,000
For instance, Manchester does do a lot of the advertising now.

446
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:16,500
They actually have representation through a body.

447
00:57:16,500 --> 00:57:29,500
So when someone says, I want to advertise on your buses, what happens is someone comes in and says, I want to advertise on your buses.

448
00:57:29,500 --> 00:57:32,000
And they're like, okay, great.

449
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:36,000
Tell us a little bit about your company.

450
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,500
Let us do some vetting.

451
00:57:38,500 --> 00:57:49,500
And we'll see if you, you know, we'll develop a proposal for you on how much we're willing to spend or give.

452
00:57:49,500 --> 00:58:33,000
very similar to what happens in the National Racing Committee you know you still you're sponsored by people but you they still have the oversight as to who or what you can put on your vehicles or so I really think that this bill is a very positive bill it's's a way to start giving back some of the trust in the people of New Hampshire, because a lot of people in New Hampshire has lost a lot of trust in our local, state, and federal government.

453
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:45,000
They don't believe in us anymore as a body, and they are starting to begin to feel as though they're being taxed without representation.

454
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:49,500
And that is a terrible, terrible way to feel.

455
00:58:49,500 --> 00:58:52,000
Thank you for your testimony.

456
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,000
Questions from the committee?

457
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,000
Representative Bromley.

458
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,000
Okay.

459
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,000
Thank you, Mr.

460
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,000
Chair.

461
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:05,000
Thank you for taking my question.

462
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:15,000
so to me if we keep this line 16 and we're really looking at commercializing the state in our towns.

463
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:29,500
I mean, plus, Amazon, for example, you'd be upsetting all of Main Street, all of our Main Streets, all of our Main Street stores who are competing against Amazon.

464
00:59:29,500 --> 00:59:34,500
I can see that being a real problem as well.

465
00:59:34,500 --> 00:59:37,000
I'm going to ask you.

466
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:39,000
Yes, I do.

467
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:44,500
So would you accept if we got rid of line 16?

468
00:59:44,500 --> 00:59:49,000
I agree with Elliot with regards to line 16.

469
00:59:49,000 --> 01:00:01,500
I mean, the thing is, is the towns, the town municipalities, we the people trust our local government more than our state and federal government.

470
01:00:01,500 --> 01:00:35,500
So the town municipality could create a committee or a group, let's say city council, town council, some kind of group that can further hone this state bill so that in your towns and municipalities, they would be able to hone it in such a way that says, and we do not allow, we will not allow corporations of over $2.4 billion to advertise in our local municipality.

471
01:00:35,500 --> 01:00:43,000
If you want to do it on a state level, you know, that's one thing.

472
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:49,500
But if you want to do it in our town of Concord, no.

473
01:00:49,500 --> 01:01:01,500
The town of Concord is going to be for our main street, our little guys, which is what makes New Hampshire and Concord fantastic.

474
01:01:01,500 --> 01:01:04,500
And that would solve two problems.

475
01:01:04,500 --> 01:01:13,500
One, it would stop the Amazons and some of the other huge corporations, including the large chain restaurants.

476
01:01:13,500 --> 01:01:27,000
It would put life back into the little mom and pop restaurants because they have budgets that could afford to put the advertising in word of mouth.

477
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:38,500
The other thing is that by taking it to the point where it's just on the website, you're losing a lot of traffic.

478
01:01:38,500 --> 01:02:28,000
The state of New Hampshire, the population in the state of New Hampshire, although some are very, very computer savvy and use the internet and the website a lot, many people on Main Street, you can go down on Main Street and you can talk to the people, and a lot of them don't often visit websites or are involved in that process whereas if there was a little in it doesn't have to necessarily be huge but there's something on there that says I'm gonna check that out I think it's important to start allowing people to have...

479
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:37,000
So by taking that out, we're eliminating some of our population by having it just on the website.

480
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:39,000
Any further questions?

481
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:41,000
No further representative?

482
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:43,000
Hold on one second.

483
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:45,000
Thank you, Mr.

484
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:47,000
Chair.

485
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:49,000
Yeah, thank you.

486
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:51,500
Over here in the corner.

487
01:02:51,500 --> 01:02:55,500
Thank you so much, Rossanne, for your testimony.

488
01:02:55,500 --> 01:02:58,500
I have not your last name.

489
01:02:58,500 --> 01:03:00,500
Could you?

490
01:03:00,500 --> 01:03:02,500
Chester.

491
01:03:02,500 --> 01:03:04,500
Chester.

492
01:03:04,500 --> 01:03:06,500
Thank you, Ms.

493
01:03:06,500 --> 01:03:08,500
Chester.

494
01:03:08,500 --> 01:03:23,000
You know, I'm reading the language of this bill and I'm having some real difficulty understanding, I guess, security concerns that I think are relevant for our election system.

495
01:03:23,000 --> 01:04:14,500
In particular, what would you say to the idea that a foreign entity or a large corporate shell company could be established in which they provide an extreme amount of dark money that is not regulated by our current election laws and makes the suggestion suggestion to the state or to a municipality we're going to give you so much money to replace all of your outdated voting system equipment and we're going to allow you to conduct an audit of the last election that you conducted to make sure that this new equipment is better suited to assist your future election systems.

496
01:04:14,500 --> 01:04:37,000
Do you see that there could be any sort of place of mistrust for any of these corporations or foreign entities who set up these shell companies and provide these donations to our state or municipalities for a free and fair election in your state?

497
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:39,000
That's a great question.

498
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:41,000
Thank you for that.

499
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:50,500
I'm actually very involved with trying to get the voting machines out of the state of New Hampshire, period.

500
01:04:50,500 --> 01:04:56,000
So I just want to be up front and totally transparent.

501
01:04:56,000 --> 01:05:38,500
the company that we are currently using is a huge conglomerate company and is a shell corporation so that's a perfect example it would allow us to be transparent and we would have things in place where companies like this can be appropriately vetted so in my opinion this helps eliminate some of the chance for the nefarious money coming in because this would give all of us, the people of New Hampshire, our local and state government to take that what is happening now.

502
01:05:38,500 --> 01:05:42,000
It goes out to the highest bidder.

503
01:05:42,000 --> 01:06:23,000
We don't know that that bidder of that the PPE for 2020 was a nefarious company something like this you know I'm just I'm going off topic here a little bit but what I can say is something like this would make us more transparent because we would create appropriate resources to do vetting of companies to try and prevent some of this money that we don't want coming into our state or some of these quid pro quo type of things.

504
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:34,000
It would actually prevent it because that committee could actually start vetting the agencies appropriately instead of always taking the highest bidder.

505
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:37,000
If you have a short question.

506
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:40,000
I do have a short follow-up.

507
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:42,000
Thank you.

508
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:45,000
And hopefully response should be short.

509
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:47,000
Okay, thank you.

510
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:53,500
So I'm looking at page two of the language of the proposed bill.

511
01:06:53,500 --> 01:06:59,000
In particular, this relates to the voluntary donations to the state.

512
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:12,000
You'll see on line 2 that it says the name of the donor of the donation under paragraph 1 shall be noted on the state's website.

513
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:15,000
In addition, oh, excuse me, yeah.

514
01:07:15,000 --> 01:08:12,000
I'm not seeing anything here about, you know, any required disclosure about who the donor is other than a name so I'm not sure that we would be able to to vet them where were you getting that indication so on a state level or on a state level the way we would vet them is we would create a it would probably go through a finance group or finance committee along with another committee so it would be generating a committee that could do this this this bill in and of itself is very very broad and it allows for if we do this then eventually then eventually we can hone it in.

515
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:27,000
So this is kind of the big ball of marbles, and we want to get down here, but this will allow us to start working towards developing a good system.

516
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:30,500
Thank you so much for your testimony.

517
01:08:30,500 --> 01:08:32,500
Any further questions?

518
01:08:32,500 --> 01:08:38,000
Seeing none, then we'll go on to our next pink card.

519
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:40,000
Thank you.

520
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:48,500
And this is from Catherine Heck from the New Hampshire Municipal Association in support of the bill.

521
01:08:48,500 --> 01:08:50,500
Good morning.

522
01:08:50,500 --> 01:09:03,500
My name is Catherine Heck from the New Hampshire Municipal Association, and I'm here to testify in support of HB 1189 as it relates to municipalities.

523
01:09:03,500 --> 01:10:32,500
So this bill provides a new financial tool for potential revenue capture for municipalities in the form of private donations outside of taxation so while donations are currently permitted and allowed and accepted by municipalities this bill actually creates a trust which allows a governing body to create an un-non lapsing trust fund and the voluntary donations can go into the trust that fit within the eligible uses outlined in the bill currently we have municipalities that accept donations to build a bandstand and the donors name might be on the bandstand or build a theater at their local school they also have street lights that were put up in a community by many donors and no names were placed just out of the kindness of their heart or our local municipal meeting places our ancient town halls are renovated with capital campaigns that don't necessarily have any donor names attached so while this is already occurring this does allow the governing body rather than the legislative body to create a trust and capture this form of revenue.

524
01:10:32,500 --> 01:10:59,500
So due to the limits of taxation repairing a bridge is a costly endeavor maintaining parks roads and large capital projects could be funded through this financial tool it also allows for the grant making process which can highly competitive, to have an alternative option to seek private donations in a very transparent way.

525
01:10:59,500 --> 01:11:02,000
So I appreciate your opportunity.

526
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:04,500
I did submit a letter.

527
01:11:04,500 --> 01:11:10,500
And if you have any questions, I'd be happy to take them.

528
01:11:10,500 --> 01:11:13,000
Thank you for your testimony.

529
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:16,000
Representative Bromley followed by Representative Almey.

530
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:18,000
All right.

531
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:20,500
Thank you for your testimony.

532
01:11:20,500 --> 01:11:22,500
Appreciate it.

533
01:11:22,500 --> 01:11:39,000
So I guess actually Representative Almey pointed out that if you go to the second page, lines three and four, it says, in addition, the governor may provide for suitable recognition of donations.

534
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:43,000
So that would be for the state properties.

535
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:46,500
I know you're just addressing the municipalities.

536
01:11:46,500 --> 01:11:52,000
I asked you the same question I asked the other two.

537
01:11:52,000 --> 01:12:05,000
If we took the line 16 out, what do you think will happen to the bill in terms of its effectiveness if we took 16 out?

538
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:10,000
We would not object to the removal of that line.

539
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:12,000
Okay, thank you.

540
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:14,000
Representative Almey.

541
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:16,000
Thank you.

542
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:24,000
I'm very confused about both parts of it, but the municipal part, which you deal with.

543
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:33,000
It sounds like the trust fund would be a common trust fund for any donations that came in.

544
01:12:33,000 --> 01:13:16,500
It doesn't talk about whether each of those donations would come in with a stated purpose, which might not be a purpose that this municipal government actually wants to use it for, or it would come to a point where it was impossible to use it for that, and what would happen in that case, just anything that's in the trust fund and the trust fund's last sentence is any other authorized expenditure on including election audit costs which is totally unrelated to infrastructure or reducing taxation.

545
01:13:16,500 --> 01:13:26,500
So I'd read that as saying that you could use this money for anything once it hit the trust fund.

546
01:13:26,500 --> 01:13:30,500
Is that the way you look at this?

547
01:13:30,500 --> 01:14:02,000
Or can you see depend on each town to make its own controls, which does vary in our state whether you're going to do that or not on or would it need a lot more work so currently under practice a town receiving any gift or donation has to account for that and use it for the purpose for which it was intended.

548
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:04,000
Exactly.

549
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:08,000
And accounting practices, best practices already require that.

550
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:18,000
So if they're following best practices and accounting standards, they would be using the gift for which it was intended.

551
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:21,000
And there's sub-accounting that would occur.

552
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:32,000
So every donation made should have a purpose attached to it so it can be tracked and followed through the accounting system.

553
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:36,000
So that would be an accounting best practice.

554
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:41,000
I can't speak to what authorized other expenditures would mean.

555
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:45,000
I think that would be the bill sponsor.

556
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:49,000
I can't speak to what those would be.

557
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:51,000
Follow-up.

558
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:53,000
Thank you.

559
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:55,000
Just a quick follow-up.

560
01:14:55,000 --> 01:15:26,000
I don't really understand your distinction between I come from a city we've got a city council we have SB1 too in the school system but your distinction between the trust fund being under control of the municipal government or the legislative body, do you mean that in most towns that you have to take it for a vote of the citizenry?

561
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:28,000
That's correct.

562
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:36,000
And, well, we've done a lot of fundraising for our library system, for parks, for everything.

563
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:38,500
And we don't need this.

564
01:15:38,500 --> 01:15:46,000
What is it that people really need that distinguishes this from what we already do?

565
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:52,500
All it does, you're absolutely correct that we do not necessarily need this.

566
01:15:52,500 --> 01:16:07,500
The law already allows us to accept gifts and donations and to do a certain amount of fundraising for projects that the governing body or the legislative body sees fit.

567
01:16:07,500 --> 01:16:15,000
This just allows another financial tool in which to do it by creating that trust.

568
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:17,000
Rep Son Urily.

569
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:22,500
I have two questions, and I would appreciate just succinct answers.

570
01:16:22,500 --> 01:16:34,500
The first question is, is there any provision in this bill to reduce the tax rate as opposed to just spending money on stuff?

571
01:16:34,500 --> 01:16:44,000
The bill allows for you to use the funds to reduce the tax rate or spend money on stuff.

572
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:46,500
It depends on donor intent.

573
01:16:46,500 --> 01:16:48,500
Okay.

574
01:16:48,500 --> 01:17:05,000
And the second question, is there any provision in this bill to prevent, say, I'll use a 1930s term, the Deutsche Bund organization from purchasing advertising on the side of a police cruiser?

575
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:08,000
I can't answer that legal question.

576
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:12,500
Are you aware of what the Deutsche Bund was?

577
01:17:12,500 --> 01:17:14,500
No, sir.

578
01:17:14,500 --> 01:17:16,500
Shall I explain?

579
01:17:16,500 --> 01:17:18,500
A short explanation.

580
01:17:18,500 --> 01:17:23,000
It was a pro-Nazi organization in the United States.

581
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:25,000
Thank you, sir.

582
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:27,000
Further questions?

583
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:29,000
Representative Ames.

584
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:34,000
I'm puzzling over what this bill adds to current law.

585
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:38,500
And you said that it allows another financial tool.

586
01:17:38,500 --> 01:17:43,500
I guess you're referring to the Voluntary Donations Trust Fund?

587
01:17:43,500 --> 01:17:45,500
That's correct.

588
01:17:45,500 --> 01:17:55,000
Isn't it the case that a municipality can set up a voluntary donations trust fund already under current law?

589
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:57,000
For a specific purpose.

590
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:59,000
Excuse me?

591
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:10,000
I could qualify that answer, but my understanding is any trust fund has to be set up for a very specific purpose.

592
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:17,500
This broadens those purposes rather than having it be set up for a specific purpose.

593
01:18:17,500 --> 01:18:23,000
If you find out any differently, would you let us know?

594
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:25,000
Yes, sir.

595
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:27,000
Thank you.

596
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:29,000
Any further questions?

597
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:31,000
Representative Gamal.

598
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:33,000
Very brief.

599
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:54,500
Did the municipal association take into account that it might cost the town money to vet these companies and have somebody manage a trust fund and the inflowing donations and with some kind of system to track if it does work as anticipated?

600
01:18:54,500 --> 01:19:18,500
Well, because it's under local control and a municipality can decide for itself whether or not they would like to engage in it, I would suppose that they would take that into account before they would accept the provision of this law and create this type of trust.

601
01:19:18,500 --> 01:19:20,500
Any further questions?

602
01:19:20,500 --> 01:19:22,500
Representative Malloy.

603
01:19:22,500 --> 01:19:24,500
Thank you.

604
01:19:24,500 --> 01:19:27,500
Thank you for taking my question.

605
01:19:27,500 --> 01:19:42,500
To that last point, do you believe that there would be professional administrative staff to manage these donations to ensure they're applied to the purpose for which they were intended?

606
01:19:42,500 --> 01:19:49,500
and that there would be another layer of management needed to execute this plan.

607
01:19:49,500 --> 01:20:10,500
I believe the level of management needed to execute this plan, in my professional opinion, would be the same as it is under the current law, which allows municipalities to accept gifts and donations and administer those as they're currently already doing.

608
01:20:10,500 --> 01:20:12,500
Any further questions?

609
01:20:12,500 --> 01:20:16,000
Seeing none, thank you for your testimony.

610
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:18,000
Thank you.

611
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:23,500
Anybody else wish to testify for or against House Bill 1189?

612
01:20:23,500 --> 01:20:29,000
Seeing none, I'm closing the public hearing on House Bill 1189.

613
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:31,000
Thank you.

614
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:33,000
Okay.

615
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:35,000
Okay.

616
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:45,500
I'm going to open the hearing on House Bill 1228 relative to the recommendations of the Joint Committee on Dedicated Funds.

617
01:20:45,500 --> 01:20:48,500
I don't have any pink cards.

618
01:20:48,500 --> 01:20:50,500
You can provide them.

619
01:20:50,500 --> 01:20:52,500
Oh, we do.

620
01:20:52,500 --> 01:20:54,500
We do.

621
01:20:54,500 --> 01:20:56,500
We do.

622
01:20:56,500 --> 01:20:58,500
Okay, Representative Major.

623
01:20:58,500 --> 01:21:04,500
And there was a handout that was handed out, this document here.

624
01:21:04,500 --> 01:21:21,500
I'm representing non-major from Rockingham district 14 representing the towns of Atkinson and Plasto I was the prime sponsor on hospital 122828, FN, relative to the recommendations of a joint committee on dedicated funds.

625
01:21:21,500 --> 01:21:25,500
Joint committee on dedicated funds meets every year.

626
01:21:25,500 --> 01:23:04,000
And each year we review one-third of all the dedicated funds that dedicated funds is over 300 of them a lot of these funds never get used they probably were used 10 years ago but the last few years haven't been used so we take the agencies associated with this and we look and you can tell if you go to page two Starting on line 10 all the way to the end of page 3 you can see in the first year we review the dedicated funds associated with the Department of Safety police standards and training council Department of Employment Security Department of Business and Economic Affairs and Department of State and this is what we reviewed last year the next year of a five-year cycle I'm not going to read them all we review another group of agencies and we go on for five years and then we started all over again when we review these agencies we asked the agency head he's number one do you have any dedicated funds with no activity over the last two years and do you agree it should be eliminated or why should it not be eliminated?

627
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:49,000
We go through and we'll end up some of them that have had no activity such as the fund for the denuclearization of nuclear power station that money is in there so when they do turn it off and they can use it to depower whatever they do so we'll keep that fun so as a result of reviewing of these five agencies if you go to the first page of the bill section one it repeals five different dedicated funds and that's associated with the division of motor vehicles.

628
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:53,500
Do you have any questions on any of them?

629
01:23:53,500 --> 01:23:55,500
Fine.

630
01:23:55,500 --> 01:24:34,000
And section two, make some changes in the amendments associated with dedicated funds and when you sometimes we find a dedicated fund doing something it's not spelled out and we need to fix that by an amendment or when we get rid of a dedicated fund we also need to check the amendments that need to be deleted also so that's essentially in section two section three is associated with the department of business and economic Affairs.

631
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:36,000
Four.

632
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:51,000
business and economic affairs for is also associated with that and there's a job grant fund is repealed section 5 repeals funds and also funds associated division of economic development.

633
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:55,500
Seven is associated with the division of economic development.

634
01:24:55,500 --> 01:24:59,000
Eight is the driver's license fee fund.

635
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:21,000
9 has to do with the privilege license fund and then the rest of the bill has to do the general fund that means there's nothing otherwise it would have gone to the general fund it's It's like on the uninsured mortars fund, $144,000.

636
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:25,000
So that will go to the general fund.

637
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:27,000
A follow-up question, Mr.

638
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:29,000
Chairman.

639
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:45,000
So I guess what I'm trying to look at is, does the state have any other fund that is dealing with promotion outside the country, or is that Representative Almi's expertise area?

640
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:47,000
Yes, they do.

641
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:49,000
Okay.

642
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:51,000
Thank you very much.

643
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:53,000
Thank you, Chairman.

644
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:55,000
Any other questions?

645
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:58,000
Let me just add to that.

646
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:03,500
This was agreed to by the commissioner of this particular agency.

647
01:26:03,500 --> 01:26:07,000
Any other questions of Representative Major Sinan?

648
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:09,000
Thank you very much.

649
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:11,000
Oh, I'm sorry.

650
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:13,000
Representative Ames.

651
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:20,500
I just wanted to first thank you and Representative Almi for some very hard work.

652
01:26:20,500 --> 01:26:27,000
I know this is tedious stuff, but it's really important, so it's appreciated.

653
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:40,000
And then I think what's involved here is getting to a level of confidence that a particular fund is inactive and needs to be closed out.

654
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:50,500
And you go through a process, this is my understanding of review, it starts with there's no activity in a fund.

655
01:26:50,500 --> 01:26:56,000
And then you ask questions and you go through a process.

656
01:26:56,000 --> 01:27:03,500
And in the end, you have a bill, which we have in front of us.

657
01:27:03,500 --> 01:27:18,500
And even at this point, it's part of the process of assuring oneself, government, that this is indeed the end of the line for this fund, and it should be.

658
01:27:18,500 --> 01:27:37,000
And so we have this process, and I think, as I recall, looking back over the many years that you've been working on this, that on rare occasions there has been new information that has come forward.

659
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:42,500
So that's part of the process, and then we reach closure.

660
01:27:42,500 --> 01:27:46,500
Is that an accurate way of describing it?

661
01:27:46,500 --> 01:28:02,500
So at the end of that closure, we have a high degree of confidence that we're not taking money out of a place where maybe next year it will really be needed.

662
01:28:02,500 --> 01:28:04,500
Right.

663
01:28:04,500 --> 01:28:24,000
We go through this process, and even right up to the last moment, if somebody out there feels that this fund needs to be kept, it gives them an opportunity to come and give us a reason of why.

664
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:27,000
And that's happened a few times.

665
01:28:27,000 --> 01:29:08,500
But over the years, at least the five years now, we we probably eliminated like about 80 funds that were in existence that well again I thank you so much for doing this I just want to point out that this is a joint committee so it's addition to Representative Major and Almey, there's Representative Edwards and Umberger, and then Senator Gaida and Senator Gray on this that have been working on this, and then the alternates are Senator D'Alessandro and Representative Leishman.

666
01:29:08,500 --> 01:29:15,500
So I guess we should thank them all for their hard work on this.

667
01:29:15,500 --> 01:29:17,500
Thank you.

668
01:29:17,500 --> 01:29:22,500
Representative Almey, do you want to say a few words?

669
01:29:22,500 --> 01:29:26,000
I'm Representative Susan Alamey, City of Lebanon.

670
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:32,500
When we started working on these funds, it was me and the LBAO.

671
01:29:32,500 --> 01:29:40,500
There were a lot of funds that the agencies didn't know they were in charge of.

672
01:29:40,500 --> 01:29:52,000
There were a number of funds that had not had money or were still holding money that had not been used for decades.

673
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:59,000
And it's been a very long process of getting all of these funds discovered.

674
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:10,500
We're still occasionally discovering something in the state government and getting them out in the open in what I call a telephone book.

675
01:30:10,500 --> 01:30:13,000
It's a listing of everything.

676
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:15,000
It's now online.

677
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:17,500
It's now easy to find.

678
01:30:17,500 --> 01:30:26,500
They hid it for several years because it was complicated and people were going to ask them questions.

679
01:30:26,500 --> 01:30:30,000
So, and then we created this committee.

680
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:44,500
Before that, we were having a really hard time getting the heads of committees to pay attention to the funds that we had declared were in their interest area.

681
01:30:44,500 --> 01:30:55,000
This committee has got, as you said, people from finance on it in both House and Senate as well as us.

682
01:30:55,000 --> 01:31:13,500
The finance people, not the ultimate so much, but have actually been showing up and feel like they've learned something from it because the finance people in the budget do not pay much attention to dedicated funds.

683
01:31:13,500 --> 01:31:16,500
There are too many of them.

684
01:31:16,500 --> 01:31:18,500
It takes too long.

685
01:31:18,500 --> 01:31:23,500
They've got too much to do with the general budget.

686
01:31:23,500 --> 01:31:27,500
So this has been very valuable for us.

687
01:31:27,500 --> 01:31:30,000
It's a five-year rotating scheme.

688
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:34,000
We are finally back in the first year.

689
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:46,500
We didn't do the first year very well in the beginning, and we've been learning over time, but I think we've got it down now.

690
01:31:46,500 --> 01:31:52,500
And I just wanted to take you very quickly through these items.

691
01:31:52,500 --> 01:32:03,000
The first two repeals are something that we looked at safety and we said to them, why are these dedicated funds?

692
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:05,000
They have no money.

693
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:15,500
And they said, oh yeah, we just moved the money straight over to the parts of the budget that need it.

694
01:32:15,500 --> 01:32:19,000
We don't put it through these funds.

695
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:23,500
So we said, can we get rid of these?

696
01:32:23,500 --> 01:32:59,500
And they said, said yes that is the state jobs grant fund this committee in 2005 the state budget included an item for co-host and Sullivan counties to help them develop jobs it was due to expire in 2009, and it came to our committee, and we modified it a little and recognized the fact that Sullivan had spent all of their side of the money, and COAS hadn't done anything yet.

697
01:32:59,500 --> 01:33:05,500
And we gave them, I think, until the money would run out.

698
01:33:05,500 --> 01:33:07,500
It was $800,000 originally.

699
01:33:07,500 --> 01:33:10,000
And it was still there.

700
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:22,000
It hadn't been used at all for at least five years, probably more than that, because it's a little complicated for COAS to use.

701
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:24,000
Thank you.

702
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:33,000
for at least five years, probably more than that, because it's a little complicated for co-hosts to use.

703
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:35,500
And Sullivan had used everything.

704
01:33:35,500 --> 01:33:43,500
It was divided into thirds, and they'd used the middle third as well as their own.

705
01:33:43,500 --> 01:33:50,000
So there's $136,000 that was left in there that had been sitting there.

706
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:57,000
And Business and Economic Affairs said, we don't, I mean, it's just sitting there.

707
01:33:57,000 --> 01:33:59,500
Let's get rid of it.

708
01:33:59,500 --> 01:34:05,000
We said, yeah, it's about time to get rid of it.

709
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:20,500
Limited Privilege License Fund was established to pay for the administrative side of special licenses, restricted licenses for DWI offenders so that they could go to their treatment and to work.

710
01:34:20,500 --> 01:34:23,500
and it's a very good program.

711
01:34:23,500 --> 01:34:26,000
Department of Safety loves it.

712
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:46,500
For a number of years now the Department of Motor Vehicles had decided it couldn't pay the the license amount which is $50 a, was not enough to pay for their administrative costs, so they just included it in their budget.

713
01:34:46,500 --> 01:35:00,500
And what this does is simply to get rid of the $50 fund and recognize that the money has been put into the Department of Motor Vehicles budget.

714
01:35:00,500 --> 01:35:09,500
And because that's part of the highway fund, the money that's in it lapses to the highway fund.

715
01:35:09,500 --> 01:35:19,000
And the last one is another one of several things that Business and Economic Affairs asked us to do.

716
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:30,500
When dread was divided up, a great deal of chaos was created in cultural and natural resources and in Business and Economic Affairs.

717
01:35:30,500 --> 01:35:42,000
And this is And we worked very hard and got the cultural and natural resources part of it straightened out the year before.

718
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:46,500
But this year, this was business and economic affairs.

719
01:35:46,500 --> 01:35:59,000
This is a very old program that wasn't doing anything anymore and that is being lapsed into another program that does very closely related stuff.

720
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:03,500
Both of them are paid for by business contributions.

721
01:36:03,500 --> 01:36:08,500
And so that essentially is what we did with those.

722
01:36:08,500 --> 01:36:15,000
Another piece of this, the International Trade Promotion Fund, is still in existence.

723
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:25,500
on it, when it was created, the language which was still existing says, the monies in this fund shall be non-lapsing.

724
01:36:25,500 --> 01:36:29,500
Somebody had been lapsing the money every year.

725
01:36:29,500 --> 01:36:46,000
So we talked it over with the comptroller, we talked it over with BEA, and we decided that the finance people actually on the committee decided that let's just say that it lapses.

726
01:36:46,000 --> 01:37:09,500
And it's zero because we're just doing what the current practice is and that occurs occasionally fairly often so that I think is all of them and it's easier to get through them than it was last year because we were doing two years at a time.

727
01:37:09,500 --> 01:37:11,500
Thank you, Representative.

728
01:37:11,500 --> 01:37:13,500
I'll meet.

729
01:37:13,500 --> 01:37:18,000
Representative Horrigan, did you fill out a print card?

730
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:20,000
Yes.

731
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:22,000
Okay.

732
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:24,000
Watch the wires.

733
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:41,000
Watch the wires watch the wires watch the wires okay I'm going to open the public hearing on House Bill 1509, an act relative to the termination of the FRM Victims Contribution Recovery Fund.

734
01:37:41,000 --> 01:37:44,000
This is sponsored by Representative Horrigan.

735
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:50,500
Representative Horrigan, it's filled out a pink card in support of the bill.

736
01:37:50,500 --> 01:37:54,000
And Representative Horrigan introduced House Bill 1509.

737
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:56,000
Thank you very much.

738
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:58,500
My name is Representative Horrigan.

739
01:37:58,500 --> 01:38:02,500
I represent the director of the District 6.

740
01:38:02,500 --> 01:38:05,000
House of Syrup and Massbury.

741
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:07,000
Colled date.

742
01:38:07,000 --> 01:38:12,000
Are we going to hear anything from the Attorney General?

743
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:14,000
Thank you.

744
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:19,500
And if I could ask just one question to Representative Horrigan.

745
01:38:19,500 --> 01:38:21,500
Yes.

746
01:38:21,500 --> 01:38:23,500
Thank you.

747
01:38:23,500 --> 01:38:32,000
have you read or been able to get to the part of our laws which Thank you.

748
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:53,500
Have you read or been able to get to the part of our laws, which is in case law or whatever you call that section that we aren't allowed to look at because our laws were sold by Acts the Tax long ago?

749
01:38:53,500 --> 01:39:01,000
on 216, 293, 4 to 5, relative to the disposition of funds in the victim.

750
01:39:01,000 --> 01:39:11,000
That particular thing, if it dated back to the Mel Thompson era, I probably would not have seen it yet.

751
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:27,500
I had a relatively short amount of time to research this because I was involved with other things, and then I didn't know this hearing was coming up today until like January 7th.

752
01:39:27,500 --> 01:39:32,500
Anyway, yes, whatever it is is probably worth looking at.

753
01:39:32,500 --> 01:39:54,500
So the LBAO has the chapter law in its office, and we ought to be able to get a copy of whatever this is for the committee as well as talking to the Attorney General's office yes thank you representing early thank you mr.

754
01:39:54,500 --> 01:40:12,000
Church thank you for taking my question representative um listening to your presentation and in reading this bill I'm a little confused and I hope you can give me a succinct answer to this question.

755
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:28,500
Do you believe that the state or the state bureaucracy has no liability because of the bureaucracy of the agency's myths and malfeasance involved with the fraud that was perpetrated on its citizens?

756
01:40:28,500 --> 01:40:33,500
Well, they were not the ones who perpetrated the fraud.

757
01:40:33,500 --> 01:40:39,500
There's certainly, as I said, a lot of blame to go around.

758
01:40:39,500 --> 01:40:48,000
I don't think the taxpayers automatically have a claim against people who were victimized by these schemes.

759
01:40:48,000 --> 01:41:00,000
So no, but I, and of course the bureaucracy is what it is because to a large extent because we wanted it that way.

760
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:13,000
We wanted minimal regulation and certainly Farrah and Dodge and the others, they certainly did design it to fall through the cracks of the existing system.

761
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:19,500
So I'm not sure whether we necessarily owe these individuals the $10 million.

762
01:41:19,500 --> 01:41:25,500
I mean, there were certainly a lot of ridiculous things going on.

763
01:41:25,500 --> 01:41:37,500
Like, for example, they had many complaints to the Attorney General's Office of Computer Fraud Hotline, which was, I think, staffed entirely by retirees.

764
01:41:37,500 --> 01:42:20,000
So it's basically just people coming in for a few hours a week to get out of retired people coming in to get out of the house who were basically doing these changes for a cup of coffee and a donut or knowing the state government maybe they didn't even provide the coffee and there was a lot of yes I mean there's a lot of like a lot of things that are wrong with the regulations and then of course it's to change them.

765
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:31,500
Like we did change RSA 397A, which is the banking regulation law, shortly after, and then we got sued by somebody who was...

766
01:42:31,500 --> 01:42:34,000
Representative Urily has a follow-up.

767
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:36,000
Okay, thanks.

768
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:40,000
Maybe I should have just said no, but...

769
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:42,000
Yeah.

770
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:45,000
That would have been succinct, Representative.

771
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:49,500
Yeah, you did ask me to be succinct tonight.

772
01:42:49,500 --> 01:43:15,000
You're aware, however, that there was a resignation by the commissioner of the banking division because his division didn't do its job, and you're aware of the difficulties within the AG's department because the AG didn't do its job and then foisted it over to the federal banks for their operations.

773
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:26,500
And you're aware that it didn't, that there was an active element to excuse the acronym CYA on the part of the agencies.

774
01:43:26,500 --> 01:43:28,500
So, I'm...

775
01:43:28,500 --> 01:43:31,000
Well, it was a mess.

776
01:43:31,000 --> 01:43:33,000
I know about that.

777
01:43:33,000 --> 01:43:38,500
I know about, I'm familiar, familiar with a lot of it.

778
01:43:38,500 --> 01:43:40,500
Thank you, Representative.

779
01:43:40,500 --> 01:43:43,000
I appreciate you acknowledging that.

780
01:43:43,000 --> 01:43:45,000
Any further questions?

781
01:43:45,000 --> 01:43:49,500
Seeing none, thank you for your testimony, Representative Horrigan.

782
01:43:49,500 --> 01:43:54,000
Next, we have Representative Hobson followed by Representative Silver.

783
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:58,500
And Representative Hobson is testifying to oppose the bill.

784
01:43:58,500 --> 01:44:03,000
Thank you, Chair Major, and thank you, honorable colleagues.

785
01:44:03,000 --> 01:44:21,500
I am here today to read some testimony from Ken Wyler, and I believe that it's important to read this so that the viewers at home who are watching this on livestream can hear Representative Wyler's viewpoint.

786
01:44:21,500 --> 01:44:24,500
So this comes direct from Rep.

787
01:44:24,500 --> 01:44:26,500
Wyler.

788
01:44:26,500 --> 01:44:38,500
Number one, the FRM scandal was unique in New Hampshire government for its size and the cover-up by leaders in at least two agencies.

789
01:44:38,500 --> 01:44:41,500
The losses were around $30 million.

790
01:44:41,500 --> 01:44:55,500
The commissioner, number two, I'm sorry, the commissioner of the banking division was forced to retire, and the attorney general for the consumer affairs division was let go.

791
01:44:55,500 --> 01:45:03,000
number three I bring two copies of the third investigative report from November 30, 2011.

792
01:45:03,000 --> 01:45:19,000
It details the findings of the committee, and while we decided that the cover-up, there is a book with the title Cover-Up, written by Mark Conley, past director of securities, as Rep.

793
01:45:19,000 --> 01:45:29,000
Horrigan mentioned, was so egregious that the state rightly owed some small portion of the investor's losses from state funds.

794
01:45:29,000 --> 01:45:37,500
If any other member wishes to have a copy, please email Ken Weiler at kweiler at AOL.com.

795
01:45:37,500 --> 01:45:42,500
This payment, number four, this payment has a long history.

796
01:45:42,500 --> 01:45:58,000
We decided on $10 million, but in several other budget bills, that amount was looked at as low-hanging fruit that some other group grabbed to bring some other program in balance.

797
01:45:58,000 --> 01:46:10,000
Number five, about six years ago, we were able to put into the forms and methods whereby the AG's office would determine the awards.

798
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:20,000
Number six, in the House version this past year, I devised sources of money that could not be used elsewhere.

799
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:24,500
The Senate had surpluses and changed to general funds.

800
01:46:24,500 --> 01:46:33,000
Number seven, the AG Charitable Trust Division has begun the application of the distribution to the victims.

801
01:46:33,000 --> 01:46:39,000
This would be a very poor time to bring this legislation forward.

802
01:46:39,000 --> 01:46:46,000
The victims of the FRM Ponzi scheme have been victimized at least three times.

803
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:54,000
First by the FRM scheme enabled by false statements by the banking division and the AG.

804
01:46:54,000 --> 01:47:00,000
Next, by the AG turning the case over to federal bankruptcy court.

805
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:09,500
Thirdly, by the federally appointed trustee who browbeat some remaining funds from the investors to pad his own fees.

806
01:47:09,500 --> 01:47:15,000
Do not let an additional attempt to defraud these victims occur.

807
01:47:15,000 --> 01:47:18,500
There is no reason for this bill.

808
01:47:18,500 --> 01:47:21,000
It is wrongheaded and vindictive.

809
01:47:21,000 --> 01:47:25,000
Please make this HB 1509 inexpedient to legislate.

810
01:47:25,000 --> 01:47:30,500
The argument as to making victims quote whole unquote is false.

811
01:47:30,500 --> 01:47:43,500
The equation for this fund is the amount lost minus the totals of the interest accrued and any and all funds received from the Thank you.

812
01:47:43,500 --> 01:47:47,000
and this was testimony by Representative Weiler.

813
01:47:47,000 --> 01:47:56,000
Yep, and you should all have a copy, and I've asked him to forward it digitally through email.

814
01:47:56,000 --> 01:47:58,500
So thank you for listening.

815
01:47:58,500 --> 01:48:01,000
Will you take any questions?

816
01:48:01,000 --> 01:48:04,500
I'm sorry, I'm not prepared for questions.

817
01:48:04,500 --> 01:48:06,500
Thank you.

818
01:48:06,500 --> 01:48:13,000
I bring two copies of the third investigative report that's in the testimony.

819
01:48:13,000 --> 01:48:15,500
Are those two copies provided?

820
01:48:15,500 --> 01:48:17,500
Do we have them?

821
01:48:17,500 --> 01:48:19,500
Yes, they are.

822
01:48:19,500 --> 01:48:31,500
We have hard copy, and I think it says if you want to email Ken Weiler to get a copy of this, you can.

823
01:48:31,500 --> 01:48:36,000
Maybe we could make hard copies for all members.

824
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:38,000
Is it long?

825
01:48:38,000 --> 01:48:40,000
We'll make hard copies.

826
01:48:40,000 --> 01:48:42,500
No, it's a short report.

827
01:48:42,500 --> 01:48:52,000
No, it is very short, and I think that further testifiers will have some information to answer your questions.

828
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:54,000
Thank you.

829
01:48:54,000 --> 01:48:56,000
Thank you.

830
01:48:56,000 --> 01:48:58,000
Representatives Silber.

831
01:48:58,000 --> 01:49:01,000
Testifying in opposition to the bill.

832
01:49:01,000 --> 01:49:03,000
Thank you, Mr.

833
01:49:03,000 --> 01:49:05,000
Chairman and colleagues.

834
01:49:05,000 --> 01:49:19,000
First of all, I'm Norman Silber, a state representative from Belknap County District 2, the towns of Guilford and Meredith, Meredith being the epicenter of the FRM scandal.

835
01:49:19,000 --> 01:49:30,500
As a side note, I am not wearing a mask this morning because I had COVID last year and successfully recovered from it.

836
01:49:30,500 --> 01:49:36,500
So my doctor says I have a lot of high national immunity.

837
01:49:36,500 --> 01:49:56,500
A hundred years ago or so, anybody who wanted to open a bank could just hang out a shingle saying at XYZ Bank and people would put their money in there, and when the monies disappeared, there was no recourse.

838
01:49:56,500 --> 01:50:03,500
So the government, federal and state, established funds to repay depositors for lost monies.

839
01:50:03,500 --> 01:50:28,500
Similarly, a hundred and some odd years ago, if you wanted to have a Ponzi scheme involving securities, unless you got caught, you basically there was almost no recourse and so the federal and state government established extensive regulatory schemes to protect investors in securities and there are recovery funds.

840
01:50:28,500 --> 01:50:37,500
For example, the Securities Investor Protection Corporation has a fund, the FDIC and banking has a fund, etc.

841
01:50:37,500 --> 01:50:50,000
And both the SEC and the securities area, the comptroller of the currency and the FDIC all do extensive examinations of these highly regulated industries.

842
01:50:50,000 --> 01:50:56,000
Now we move to FRM, which was supposedly a mortgage investment operation.

843
01:50:56,000 --> 01:51:01,000
Many of you probably know some of the sordid history.

844
01:51:01,000 --> 01:51:29,500
Some of you relatively new may not know the sordid history but obviously it was it turned out a Ponzi scheme where people's monies later investors monies was used to pay off initial or earlier investors and there were actually little or no actual investments in real estate mortgages which was the purpose of the scheme supposedly.

845
01:51:29,500 --> 01:51:35,500
So some people a couple of people other promoters went to jail.

846
01:51:35,500 --> 01:51:39,000
Now who were the investors in FRM?

847
01:51:39,000 --> 01:51:41,000
Were they big companies?

848
01:51:41,000 --> 01:51:46,000
Were they big rich investors?, I think, uniformly is no.

849
01:51:46,000 --> 01:52:08,500
The investors, for the most part, while not exclusively centered in my county, Belknap County, but certainly most of them were from Belknap County, were hardworking individuals who had accumulated some funds at a time when banks were paying little or no interest on funds.

850
01:52:08,500 --> 01:52:20,500
And they were induced to invest with the promise that they were going to get a secure investment with a decent rate of return.

851
01:52:20,500 --> 01:52:25,000
And of course it didn't turn out that way.

852
01:52:25,000 --> 01:52:29,000
It turned out that they lost their money.

853
01:52:29,000 --> 01:52:45,500
People who know me in my politics for the two terms I've been in the legislature know that I am probably the last person in the legislature to advocate giving away taxpayer money.

854
01:52:45,500 --> 01:52:48,500
I am a low tax guy.

855
01:52:48,500 --> 01:53:38,000
But it seems to me that when you are dealing with a highly regulated industry, which is what mortgage banking is supposed to be in our state and you have several agencies involved in that regulation and those agencies fail the taxpayers many times because there were many opportunities for them to have caught the scheme early on and prevented the level of losses and there are reports and I don't know if they're true or not, that there were relatives of one of the heads of one of our state departments were actually investors, equity investors in FRM.

856
01:53:38,000 --> 01:53:46,000
So the only people that went to jail were the people who were the actual promoters.

857
01:53:46,000 --> 01:54:22,500
But we had people in the banking department and we had people in the attorney general's office who completely ignored and not only ignored their obligation to the taxpayers to regulate and to call a halt to any fraudulent schemes, but when asked by prospective investors to these agencies, they were reassured that FRM was sound, notwithstanding the fact that there were approximately 70 indicia over the years that fraud was taking place.

858
01:54:22,500 --> 01:54:48,000
So my view is that when the government has utterly failed our citizenry, who paid taxes in the expectation that a regulated industry is going to be properly regulated, that if we have the ability to provide for some sort of recompense, and let's talk about the numbers, five and five.

859
01:54:48,000 --> 01:54:56,000
Those numbers have been kicked around by the state senate and by the house for years.

860
01:54:56,000 --> 01:55:09,000
And we finally ended up with a proposal in the budget bill passed by the house and the senate to fund this fund, this recompense fund.

861
01:55:09,000 --> 01:55:14,500
What does it give you, what does it give people back?

862
01:55:14,500 --> 01:55:17,000
Does it make them whole?

863
01:55:17,000 --> 01:55:19,500
Not by a long shot.

864
01:55:19,500 --> 01:55:26,000
It makes gives them a slight percentage of what they've lost in recovery.

865
01:55:26,000 --> 01:55:43,500
I personally know constituents and members of this general court who were investors who had to go through personal bankruptcy as a result of losses through the FRM scandal, which the state failed our citizens.

866
01:55:43,500 --> 01:56:03,500
So that's why I believe that we were able to pass finally, after many years of talking and discussion and debate, in the House and the Senate and in the budget bill this fund, which gives a nominal amount of...

867
01:56:03,500 --> 01:56:17,000
and discussion and debate in the House and the Senate and in the budget bill, this fund, which gives a nominal amount of recovery to the investors.

868
01:56:17,000 --> 01:56:23,000
I recommend that the committee vote this bill in expedient to legislate.

869
01:56:23,000 --> 01:56:26,000
Thank you for your testimony, Representative.

870
01:56:26,000 --> 01:56:28,000
Would you take questions?

871
01:56:28,000 --> 01:56:30,000
Absolutely.

872
01:56:30,000 --> 01:56:33,000
Representative Almey followed by Representative Bromney.

873
01:56:33,000 --> 01:56:37,000
I may have to give you lawyerly answers.

874
01:56:37,000 --> 01:56:39,000
That's okay.

875
01:56:39,000 --> 01:57:35,500
I've been around here a long time and i can't remember when this started to break but i wanted to ask you because you probably know the answer to this on at the time what they were talking about was that the Finance Committee had decided to reorganize the responsibilities of the Banking Commission, the Securities Division, in the Secretary of State's office, which also was tangled into this as one of the people who might have made it worse, and the Attorney General's office, and that they left out some responsibilities when they reorganized them, and that the agencies, it was the legislature somewhat more than the agencies that created this problem.

876
01:57:35,500 --> 01:57:39,500
Do you, had you heard anything like that?

877
01:57:39,500 --> 01:57:51,000
What I have heard is that the Securities Division was the only state agency that seemed to be not asleep at the switch.

878
01:57:51,000 --> 01:58:07,500
That the Banking Department and the Attorney General's office were not only asleep at the switch, but in fact facil the fraud by their some of their answers to inquiries by prospective investors.

879
01:58:07,500 --> 01:58:11,500
So I don't know what reorganization was done.

880
01:58:11,500 --> 01:58:23,500
Keep in mind that the members, the staff, unless they have committed an actual criminal act, are going to be immune under sovereign immunity.

881
01:58:23,500 --> 01:58:45,000
So while I might have a personal view as to what some of the folks in the AG's office and the banking department, where they should be playing tennis in some fed somewhere, and they're not, that can't happen, and that didn't happen.

882
01:58:45,000 --> 01:59:03,500
So I don't know what happened other than the fact that I have been told by people who were intimately involved that the securities division were the only people who seemed to know what was going on.

883
01:59:03,500 --> 01:59:07,500
I don't know if that answers your question.

884
01:59:07,500 --> 01:59:10,000
Gives me a second perspective.

885
01:59:10,000 --> 01:59:12,000
Thank you.

886
01:59:12,000 --> 01:59:14,000
Thank you, Mr.

887
01:59:14,000 --> 01:59:16,000
Chair.

888
01:59:16,000 --> 01:59:19,000
Thank you for taking my question.

889
01:59:19,000 --> 01:59:33,500
So I think he answered the question about is there any additional money in the fund because it sounds like this is the first budget that we're funding this.

890
01:59:33,500 --> 01:59:35,500
Is that correct?

891
01:59:35,500 --> 01:59:37,500
Correct.

892
01:59:37,500 --> 01:59:39,500
Yes.

893
01:59:39,500 --> 01:59:43,000
So what does the $10 million do?

894
01:59:43,000 --> 01:59:53,000
What percent of the, well, first off, do we know how many folks will actually request money from this fund?

895
01:59:53,000 --> 01:59:57,500
The answer is we do not know how many.

896
01:59:57,500 --> 02:00:14,000
Historically, in cases like this or in class actions, which are very similar, and they establish a recovery fund, if you get a 60% application rate, 60% to 70% rate, that's probably high.

897
02:00:14,000 --> 02:00:23,000
So 20% to 30% of people just say, you know, I've lost the money and they walk away.

898
02:00:23,000 --> 02:00:26,500
So we don't know that's number one.

899
02:00:26,500 --> 02:00:41,500
And number two, we don't know the percentage because it's done pro rata, but it's going to be somewhere in 20% to 30% of their out-of One more follow up.

900
02:00:41,500 --> 02:00:43,500
Follow up.

901
02:00:43,500 --> 02:00:57,000
So would you say that, depending how many people actually apply over the next two years, really, what are the chances of the legislature approving additional money?

902
02:00:57,000 --> 02:01:06,500
Do you think that's necessary, first off, and do you know if that will happen in the next biennium?

903
02:01:06,500 --> 02:01:14,500
Some might think it would be necessary, but I would not be in favor of it.

904
02:01:14,500 --> 02:01:16,500
Thank you.

905
02:01:16,500 --> 02:01:18,500
Representative Yule.

906
02:01:18,500 --> 02:01:20,500
Thank you, Mr.

907
02:01:20,500 --> 02:01:22,500
Chair.

908
02:01:22,500 --> 02:01:24,500
Thank you, fellow survivor.

909
02:01:24,500 --> 02:01:31,500
Although you seem to have made out better than I did, but that's okay.

910
02:01:31,500 --> 02:01:35,500
I have two questions, if don't mind Mr.

911
02:01:35,500 --> 02:01:59,000
Chair quickly uh the first one is a real simple one and I think you kind of answered it but I just want to hear a really short answer so is it your opinion personally that the current bill is a process to make the investors whole?

912
02:01:59,000 --> 02:02:04,500
The budget bill that was passed gives the investors partial recovery.

913
02:02:04,500 --> 02:02:08,500
The existing bill removes any chance of recovery.

914
02:02:08,500 --> 02:02:12,500
This bill we're hearing today wipes that out.

915
02:02:12,500 --> 02:02:21,000
And just to be fair, so I'll ask you the same question I asked the previous representative.

916
02:02:21,000 --> 02:02:33,000
Do you believe the state has any liability for the bureaucratic myths and malfeasance that has been clearly demonstrated with regards to the investors?

917
02:02:33,000 --> 02:02:36,000
I'll give you the lawyerly answer.

918
02:02:36,000 --> 02:02:39,500
No, I want a yes or no.

919
02:02:39,500 --> 02:02:45,000
There is no legal liability, but there is certainly moral liability.

920
02:02:45,000 --> 02:02:47,000
Thank you, sir.

921
02:02:47,000 --> 02:02:49,000
Further questions?

922
02:02:49,000 --> 02:02:51,000
Rep.

923
02:02:51,000 --> 02:02:53,000
Schoenberg.

924
02:02:53,000 --> 02:02:55,000
Thank you, Mr.

925
02:02:55,000 --> 02:02:57,000
Chairman.

926
02:02:57,000 --> 02:03:00,500
Thank you, Representative, for taking my question.

927
02:03:00,500 --> 02:03:18,500
The FRM Victims Contribution Recovery Fund that was in the budget bill, was that ever presented to a New Hampshire State House committee as a form of a bill for public discussion this past legislative session?

928
02:03:18,500 --> 02:03:43,500
I believe it was, along with many other so-called policy bills, and they were then passed to the Senate, and the Senate adopted them, and then they were all folded into the budget bill in that cluster, whatever we were doing to throw so much stuff into the budget bill.

929
02:03:43,500 --> 02:03:50,000
But I do believe it was heard by both Senate and House committees.

930
02:03:50,000 --> 02:03:52,000
Follow-up question, Mr.

931
02:03:52,000 --> 02:03:54,000
Chairman.

932
02:03:54,000 --> 02:03:56,000
Follow-up.

933
02:03:56,000 --> 02:04:03,000
Would you be able to get the House committee that did hear that bill?

934
02:04:03,000 --> 02:04:06,000
I will endeavor to do so.

935
02:04:06,000 --> 02:04:08,000
Thank you, sir.

936
02:04:08,000 --> 02:04:10,000
Appreciate it.

937
02:04:10,000 --> 02:04:12,000
Further questions?

938
02:04:12,000 --> 02:04:14,000
Representative Gamalo.

939
02:04:14,000 --> 02:04:16,000
Thank you, Mr.

940
02:04:16,000 --> 02:04:18,000
Chair.

941
02:04:18,000 --> 02:04:21,000
Thank you for taking my question.

942
02:04:21,000 --> 02:04:36,500
What I understood from the sponsor of the bill was that this act comes into effect July 1 of 2023, in essence giving victims two years to access the $10 million.

943
02:04:36,500 --> 02:04:39,000
Is that correct or incorrect?

944
02:04:39,000 --> 02:04:47,000
I'm not that familiar with the intricacies of the procedure to follow for applying for recovery.

945
02:04:47,000 --> 02:04:50,500
I can't say that I know that.

946
02:04:50,500 --> 02:04:52,500
Further questions?

947
02:04:52,500 --> 02:04:54,500
Thank you.

948
02:04:54,500 --> 02:04:59,000
I see none, so thank you for your testimony.

949

Chair Mr.

952
02:05:16,000 --> 02:05:31,000
Chair, over here I just want to underscore and repeat that we really need to hear from the Attorney General's office on the status of the administration of this responsibility.

953
02:05:31,000 --> 02:05:33,000
I certainly agree.

954
02:05:33,000 --> 02:05:35,000
Mr.

955
02:05:35,000 --> 02:05:37,000

Representative Hogan.

I just have some.

958
02:05:41,000 --> 02:05:53,000
Representative Hobson mentioned the Weiler report, and I printed it up and left that one at home, but I've got several other printouts here.

959
02:05:53,000 --> 02:06:35,500
I mean, research staff will take up all this stuff pretty shortly anyway, but would you like me to leave this with the clerk and they can put it in the bill file like these extra copies of it sure Yeah, yeah the Wiley report I looked at he was on a committee I think it was in 2013 and I have looked at it, but I fortunately did not bring that copy of it although apparently anyway Thank you On the blue sheet, Jennifer.

There are some.

963
02:06:41,500 --> 02:06:44,000

Yes.

965
02:06:46,000 --> 02:06:48,500

I close the public hearing.

977
02:07:25,500 --> 02:07:31,000

I have the same problem with my fluid, just not being able to keep my windshield clean.

1017
02:08:56,500 --> 02:08:59,500
I'm wondering if it's a little.

1018
02:08:59,500 --> 02:09:05,500
Well, once again, but the light is for, it releases other stuff.

1045
02:10:43,500 --> 02:10:46,000
It's our state's service commission.

1046
02:10:46,000 --> 02:11:06,000
Volunteer New Hampshire is a granted states partner to the federal agency AmeriCorps which works with local and national partners to tap the power of the American people to tackle our country's most pressing challenges through national and community service.

1047
02:11:06,000 --> 02:11:16,000
Colleagues I'm here today today to introduce House Bill 1524 to establish a National Service Alumni Attraction and Retention Fund.

1048
02:11:16,000 --> 02:11:21,000
It's the first of its kind anywhere in the country.

1049
02:11:21,000 --> 02:11:51,000
It would set aside American Rescue Plans Act funding to be made available to colleges and universities and employers across the state as scholarships and bonuses for National Service alumni from all across the country, showing that New Hampshire really values the experience of civilian national service, individuals who have served on diverse teams, worked under pressure, and solved problems.

1050
02:11:51,000 --> 02:11:55,000
First, a little bit of background on AmeriCorps.

1051
02:11:55,000 --> 02:12:08,500
In 2020, more than 2,500 Americans of all ages and backgrounds united to meet local needs, strengthen communities, and expand opportunity through national service in New Hampshire.

1052
02:12:08,500 --> 02:12:23,000
AmeriCorps invested more than $6.6 million in federal funding to support cost-effective community solutions, working hand-in-hand with local partners to empower individuals to help communities tackle their toughest challenges.

1053
02:12:23,000 --> 02:12:27,500
AmeriCorps members are preparing today's students for tomorrow's jobs.

1054
02:12:27,500 --> 02:12:31,500
They're helping communities and families impacted by COVID-19.

1055
02:12:31,500 --> 02:12:34,500
They're reducing crime and reviving cities.

1056
02:12:34,500 --> 02:12:37,000
They're connecting veterans to services.

1057
02:12:37,000 --> 02:12:40,500
They're fighting to end the opioid epidemic.

1058
02:12:40,500 --> 02:12:46,000
They're helping seniors live independently, and they're rebuilding communities after disasters.

1059
02:12:46,000 --> 02:13:04,000
AmeriCorps members served at more than 300 locations across New Hampshire, very likely in many of your districts, including schools, food banks, homeless shelters, health clinics, youth centers, veterans facilities, and other non-profit and faith-based organizations.

1060
02:13:04,000 --> 02:13:16,500
AmeriCorps and its partners generated more than $5.7 million in outside resources from businesses, foundations, public agencies, and other sources in New Hampshire in 2020.

1061
02:13:16,500 --> 02:13:23,000
This local support strengthened community impact and increased the return on taxpayer dollars.

1062
02:13:23,000 --> 02:13:47,500
A recent study by ICF commissioned by Voices for National Service and funded by the Charles Stewart Mott Foundation found that national service programs that leverage the skills and to address unmet community needs, they offer substantial monetary benefits for all stakeholder groups and a significant return on investment.

1063
02:13:47,500 --> 02:13:59,000
Economists report that for every dollar that Congress appropriates to AmeriCorps, it returns more than $17 to society, program members, and the government.

1064
02:13:59,000 --> 02:14:04,500
Personally, AmeriCorps is where I got my start in public service.

1065
02:14:04,500 --> 02:14:36,500
It was my first job after graduating from Plymouth State College as a team leader with City or New Hampshire, training and supporting a diverse team of young adults from all across the country, from all different backgrounds and walks of life, who came together to serve as AmeriCorps National Service members in some of our state's highest need and most under-resourced public schools.

1066
02:14:36,500 --> 02:14:53,500
We served as full-time tutors, mentors, and role models, all for a modest living stipend, an education award equal to the Pell Grant, which I used to pay back some of my student loans.

1067
02:14:53,500 --> 02:14:56,500
That experience really changed my life.

1068
02:14:56,500 --> 02:15:10,500
It was my very first job, and it was the very best job that I've ever had, and it started me down a career path of public service.

1069
02:15:10,500 --> 02:15:13,000
I'm originally from New Hampshire.

1070
02:15:13,000 --> 02:15:23,000
I grew up in Nashua, went to college in Plymouth, served on the seacoast, and put down roots in Manchester.

1071
02:15:23,000 --> 02:15:37,500
My wife Jody is also an AmeriCorps alum, originally from New Jersey, so she's a transplant, and we're raising two future AmeriCorps members, our eight-year-old Ben and six-year-old Rosie.

1072
02:15:37,500 --> 02:16:10,500
Some of our family's best friends came to New Hampshire from all across the country to do their service year in New Hampshire and we love that they stayed however for each of them there are hundreds who pack up after their service here and put New Hampshire in their rearview mirror permanently each taking with them their Segal AmeriCorps Education Award valued at around $7,000.

1073
02:16:10,500 --> 02:16:21,500
And they take with them also their skills in high-demand fields like education and health care that our state so desperately needs.

1074
02:16:21,500 --> 02:16:55,500
So that's why when I was first elected to the legislature in 2018, I wanted to figure out how to leverage the proven power and the unrealized potential of civilian national service to address New Hampshire's brain drain in order to attract and retain more community-minded and service-driven AmeriCorps alumni and returned Peace Corps volunteers for an affordable degree or credential and a meaningful career in our state.

1075
02:16:55,500 --> 02:17:03,000
So my first bill as a state rep established a National Service Workforce Pathways Commission.

1076
02:17:03,000 --> 02:17:17,000
It's a bipartisan bill passed unanimously through both the House and the Senate on the consent calendar in both chambers, was enthusiastically signed into law by Governor Sununu.

1077
02:17:17,000 --> 02:17:30,500
I chaired that commission, which included leaders from across sectors, and we came up with recommendations, two of which are included in the bill before you today.

1078
02:17:30,500 --> 02:18:04,000
Recommendation number two is within the the Service Year Workforce Commission recommendations is to strengthen existing and establish new pathways from AmeriCorps and the Peace Corps to post-secondary education including increasing the number of public and private institutions of higher education that participate in the Siegel AmeriCorps Education Award matching program, which has since been rebranded as AmeriCorps Schools of Service, as well as the Paul D.

1079
02:18:04,000 --> 02:18:11,000
Coverdell Fellows Program for returned Peace Corps volunteers, and that's a graduate school program.

1080
02:18:11,000 --> 02:18:35,500
Recommendation number three from our commission was to strengthen existing and establish new pathways from AmeriCorps and the Peace Corps to employment in New Hampshire, including increasing the number of companies, non-profit organizations, and government agencies that participate in the Employers of National Service program for National Service alumni.

1081
02:18:35,500 --> 02:18:52,500
So House Bill 1524, it establishes a national service alumni attraction and retention fund, really to provide a carrot for New Hampshire employers and institutions of higher ed to join these nationally recognized programs.

1082
02:18:52,500 --> 02:19:12,500
By growing our state's participation in these programs, we can make New Hampshire the top post-service destination for AmeriCorps alumni and returned Peace Corps volunteers, and it can make a real dent in our state's brain drain and workforce challenges.

1083
02:19:12,500 --> 02:19:43,500
Funded by the American Rescue Plan Act and administered by Volunteer New Hampshire and the State Department of Administrative Services, it would grant to enrolled employers of national service, sorry, grants to enrolled employers of national service could be set up as a one-for-one, dollar-for-dollar match for employers, offering sign-on and or annual bonuses to AmeriCorps alumni and returned Peace Corps volunteers.

1084
02:19:43,500 --> 02:20:26,500
And grants to enrolled schools of service and Coverdell Fellows institutions could be set up as one to one to one match for colleges where students could use their federal education award college match and the National Service Alumni Attraction and Retention Fund to match as well with the high cost of higher education in the state of New, I think it would go a long way to get colleges to come to the table to say, we're going to put some skin in the game.

1085
02:20:26,500 --> 02:20:36,000
We know that the young person who wants to get their education here has some skin in the game.

1086
02:20:36,000 --> 02:20:51,000
The education award that they earned during their year of service and then for the state to be able to match that with ARPA funds could go a long way.

1087
02:20:51,000 --> 02:21:39,000
So by leveraging federal funding and at no additional cost to New Hampshire taxpayers, we have an opportunity to make New Hampshire stand out as a destination for hardworking young Americans to not only pursue national and community service, but also stay for an affordable college degree or credential and a meaningful career, especially in high-demand public service jobs like health care and education so colleagues I urge you to adopt a bipartisan ought to pass recommendation hearing committee and I welcome your questions thank you for your testimony represent Romney thank you Thank you, Mr.

1088
02:21:39,000 --> 02:21:41,000
Chair.

1089
02:21:41,000 --> 02:21:43,500
Thank you for your testimony.

1090
02:21:43,500 --> 02:21:46,000
Thank you for being here.

1091
02:21:46,000 --> 02:21:50,500
So let's start with the American Rescue Plan funds.

1092
02:21:50,500 --> 02:22:02,500
I know in Rockingham County, I was involved in coming up with the plan to spend the funds, the $60 million that Rockingham got.

1093
02:22:02,500 --> 02:22:05,500
So all that money is obligated.

1094
02:22:05,500 --> 02:22:18,000
So are you saying that there's still money not obligated that went to the state of New Hampshire that's still available to put into this?

1095
02:22:18,000 --> 02:22:20,000
That's my understanding, yes.

1096
02:22:20,000 --> 02:22:22,000
Okay.

1097
02:22:22,000 --> 02:22:34,000
Because that's an important piece of this, that there's money left to, and what this bill is going to direct some of that money.

1098
02:22:34,000 --> 02:22:38,500
My understanding is the committee that's looking at this.

1099
02:22:38,500 --> 02:22:43,000
Maybe the chair can help me out with that.

1100
02:22:43,000 --> 02:22:47,500
But okay, so I just want to understand that.

1101
02:22:47,500 --> 02:22:50,000
But this money isn't forever.

1102
02:22:50,000 --> 02:22:52,000
So what happens?

1103
02:22:52,000 --> 02:22:54,000
Sorry, Mr.

1104
02:22:54,000 --> 02:22:56,000
Chair, follow up.

1105
02:22:56,000 --> 02:22:58,000
This money isn't forever.

1106
02:22:58,000 --> 02:23:06,500
So how do we replace that money in future years once this rescue plan money goes away?

1107
02:23:06,500 --> 02:23:09,500
Thank you, Representative, for the question.

1108
02:23:09,500 --> 02:23:16,500
I, you know, this, in many ways, I look at as a pilot program.

1109
02:23:16,500 --> 02:23:27,500
These are one-time funds that are available to the state of New Hampshire that could be allocated for this workforce development purpose.

1110
02:23:27,500 --> 02:23:35,000
You know, I think we need to evaluate the program like we would any program.

1111
02:23:35,000 --> 02:24:00,000
And if this is something that the state wanted to continue, if they felt like it was a good return on investment, if there were other federal funds that could be used to support that program in the future, I think that's a conversation that can happen down the line.

1112
02:24:00,000 --> 02:24:17,500
But I think it would be important to make clear with the launch of the program to employers and to institutions of higher ed that this is one-time money that's available for a limited time.

1113
02:24:17,500 --> 02:25:03,500
But I think what it does, this invests in these programs that are so important and that have been underutilized by employers and colleges and universities in the state up until now I've got a list I could tell you what the colleges and universities that have already signed up for you know to match these education awards that these young people get when they finish their year of service and employers that say hey you know anything from we'll guarantee you a job interview if you've done a year of service.

1114
02:25:03,500 --> 02:25:11,000
There are a few other things that they can do to qualify for the program.

1115
02:25:11,000 --> 02:25:32,500
But what it would allow the state of New Hampshire to do, it's kind of the carrot to encourage these organizations to provide some additional incentives to young people as they're trying to figure out what they want to do with their lives.

1116
02:25:32,500 --> 02:25:39,000
And hopefully hopefully encourage some of them to do a year of service.

1117
02:25:39,000 --> 02:25:50,000
So there's no specific dollar amount in the bill in terms of what you'd like to see from the American Rescue Plan.

1118
02:25:50,000 --> 02:25:57,000
Is it if we pass this, then you would have to argue your point?

1119
02:25:57,000 --> 02:25:59,000
Is that the strategy?

1120
02:25:59,000 --> 02:26:08,500
Then after this is passed, that you would have to argue with others for that American Rescue Fund money?

1121
02:26:08,500 --> 02:26:10,500
Yeah.

1122
02:26:10,500 --> 02:26:29,000
I mean, my understanding is that if this comes to this committee first, goes to the floor, passes the floor, it will get kicked over to fiscal, and we would need to have a conversation about it.

1123
02:26:29,000 --> 02:26:35,500
Yeah, because, again, there's no amount here that you're going to be requesting.

1124
02:26:35,500 --> 02:26:37,500
So, okay, thank you.

1125
02:26:37,500 --> 02:26:39,500
You're welcome.

1126
02:26:39,500 --> 02:26:42,000
For other questions, Representative Almey.

1127
02:26:42,000 --> 02:26:44,000
Thank you, Mr.

1128
02:26:44,000 --> 02:26:46,000
Chairman.

1129
02:26:46,000 --> 02:26:53,500
First, I wanted to just confirm with you on the structure of Volunteer New Hampshire.

1130
02:26:53,500 --> 02:26:58,000
There is a board of directors, an executive director.

1131
02:26:58,000 --> 02:27:00,500
They're administratively attached to DAS.

1132
02:27:00,500 --> 02:27:02,500
That's correct.

1133
02:27:02,500 --> 02:27:04,500
That's true?

1134
02:27:04,500 --> 02:27:06,500
Thank you.

1135
02:27:06,500 --> 02:27:25,000
And then I wanted to ask, you specifically state in the bill, the commissioner, who is DAS, shall credit all state funds received from the American Rescue Plan for the purpose of this subdivision to the fund.

1136
02:27:25,000 --> 02:28:06,000
That is, you know that there is in the American Rescue Plan a section which is funding for something that is covered by this yes and all of that money according to this bill would go there well and perhaps we need to adjust it thank you for the question representative i think you know there needs to be a specific amount i mean the way the bill is drafted there is is no specific amount that is allocated to this fund.

1137
02:28:06,000 --> 02:29:01,000
And so what I'm hearing from committees is that it's going to be important to clarify what that is and how much money is in there so that it's not all ARPA funds that are accredited to the state of New Hampshire for workforce development, let's say, go to this program do you know sorry do you know where where we would get that information from I can double check or the chair can double check who we need to talk to to find out how much money we're talking about because if it's $50,000 a year and it costs $42,000 to administer it in DAS, we've got a problem.

1138
02:29:01,000 --> 02:29:03,000
Right.

1139
02:29:03,000 --> 02:29:05,000
Thank you.

1140
02:29:05,000 --> 02:29:07,000
You're welcome.

1141
02:29:07,000 --> 02:29:09,000
Other questions?

1142
02:29:09,000 --> 02:29:11,000
Representative Brown.

1143
02:29:11,000 --> 02:29:13,000
More clarifying.

1144
02:29:13,000 --> 02:29:15,000
Thank you, Representative Almey.

1145
02:29:15,000 --> 02:29:17,000
I missed that.

1146
02:29:17,000 --> 02:29:27,000
They're asking for the money that's allocated and the American Rescue Plan is a certain amount that you can allocate.

1147
02:29:27,000 --> 02:29:29,000
And I agree.

1148
02:29:29,000 --> 02:29:32,500
We need to know what that is.

1149
02:29:32,500 --> 02:29:35,000
Not leave it to finance.

1150
02:29:35,000 --> 02:29:37,000
Right.

1151
02:29:37,000 --> 02:29:39,000
So OK.

1152
02:29:39,000 --> 02:29:41,500
Well, that clarifies my thinking.

1153
02:29:41,500 --> 02:29:45,000
I just want to make that statement.

1154
02:29:45,000 --> 02:29:47,000
Thank you for that.

1155
02:29:47,000 --> 02:29:49,000
Great.

1156
02:29:49,000 --> 02:29:51,000
Thank you.

1157
02:29:51,000 --> 02:29:53,000
Further questions.

1158
02:29:53,000 --> 02:29:55,500
I see no further questions.

1159
02:29:55,500 --> 02:29:57,500
So thank you.

1160
02:29:57,500 --> 02:29:59,500
Thank you, Chairman.

1161
02:29:59,500 --> 02:30:05,000
Anybody else wish to testify for or against House Bill 1524?

1162
02:30:05,000 --> 02:30:08,000
Jennifer, nothing on the blue sheet.

1163
02:30:08,000 --> 02:30:14,000
So I'm going to close the public hearing on House Bill 1524.

1164
02:30:14,000 --> 02:30:16,000
Mr.

1165
02:30:16,000 --> 02:30:18,000
Chairman?

1166
02:30:18,000 --> 02:30:20,000
Yes.

1167
02:30:20,000 --> 02:30:28,000
We do have the ability to sign up in favor or oppose to legislation online still.

1168
02:30:28,000 --> 02:30:30,500
I just discovered that yesterday.

1169
02:30:30,500 --> 02:30:32,500
I didn't know that.

1170
02:30:32,500 --> 02:30:39,500
Yeah, so there's a possibility there would be people for several of these bills.

1171
02:30:39,500 --> 02:30:41,500
Thanks.

1172
02:30:41,500 --> 02:30:43,500
Mr.

1173
02:30:43,500 --> 02:30:56,000
Chair, to clarify what Representative Almey said, I guess you're saying if they're online that we should read them into the record at some point?

1174
02:30:56,000 --> 02:30:58,000
Yeah.

1175
02:30:58,000 --> 02:31:00,000
Okay.

1176
02:31:00,000 --> 02:31:02,000
Okay.

1177
02:31:02,000 --> 02:31:04,000
Okay.

1178
02:31:04,000 --> 02:31:11,500
Jennifer, could you check on that, and then we will read those into the record?

1179
02:31:11,500 --> 02:31:13,500
Thank you.

1180
02:31:13,500 --> 02:31:18,500
For 50.4 on the line, there are 24 and 24.

1181
02:31:18,500 --> 02:31:26,000
Would you like to share any of the other bills for today in the morning?

1182
02:31:26,000 --> 02:31:28,000
Right.

1183
02:31:28,000 --> 02:31:35,000
Well, if you can get a copy, then we'll read them in this afternoon.

1184
02:31:35,000 --> 02:31:37,000
Okay.

1185
02:31:37,000 --> 02:31:42,500
Just so you know, these sheets are open until midnight tonight.

1186
02:31:42,500 --> 02:31:44,500
Oh.

1187
02:31:44,500 --> 02:31:47,500
So they may not be completed.

1188
02:31:47,500 --> 02:31:50,000
They'll be completed until then.

1189
02:31:50,000 --> 02:31:52,000
Oh, that's great.

1190
02:31:52,000 --> 02:31:54,000
The hearing is over.

1191
02:31:54,000 --> 02:31:57,500
Okay, I guess we have no choice.

1192
02:31:57,500 --> 02:32:01,000
And we'll read them in on Thursday.

1193
02:32:01,000 --> 02:32:05,500
People are not, however, allowed to testify that way.

1194
02:32:05,500 --> 02:32:07,500
Anything else?

1195
02:32:07,500 --> 02:32:11,500
If not, we're on break until 1 o'clock.

1196
02:32:11,500 --> 02:32:13,500
Thank you.

1197
02:32:13,500 --> 02:32:15,500
Thank you.

1198
02:32:15,500 --> 02:32:17,500
Thank you.

1199
02:32:17,500 --> 02:32:19,500
Thank you.

1200
02:32:19,500 --> 02:32:21,500
Thank you.

1201
02:32:21,500 --> 02:32:23,500
Thank you.

1202
02:32:23,500 --> 02:32:25,500
Thank you.

1203
02:32:25,500 --> 02:32:27,500
Thank you.

1204
02:32:27,500 --> 02:32:29,500
Thank you.

1205
02:32:29,500 --> 02:32:31,500
Thank you.

1206
02:32:31,500 --> 02:32:33,500
Thank you.

1207
02:32:33,500 --> 02:32:35,500
Thank you.

1208
02:32:35,500 --> 02:32:37,500
Thank you.

1209
02:32:37,500 --> 02:32:39,500
Thank you.

1210
02:32:39,500 --> 02:32:41,500
Thank you.

1211
02:32:41,500 --> 02:32:43,500
Thank you.

1212
02:32:43,500 --> 02:32:45,500
Thank you.

1213
02:32:45,500 --> 02:32:47,500
Thank you.

1214
02:32:47,500 --> 02:32:49,500
Thank you.

1215
02:32:49,500 --> 02:32:51,500
Thank you.

1216
02:32:51,500 --> 02:32:53,500
Thank you.

1217
02:32:53,500 --> 02:32:55,500
Thank you.

1218
02:32:55,500 --> 02:32:57,500
Thank you.

1219
02:32:57,500 --> 02:32:59,500
Thank you.

1220
02:32:59,500 --> 02:33:01,500
Thank you.

1221
02:33:01,500 --> 02:33:03,500
Thank you.

1222
02:33:03,500 --> 02:33:05,500
Thank you.

1223
02:33:05,500 --> 02:33:07,500
Thank you.

1224
02:33:07,500 --> 02:33:09,500
Thank you.

1225
02:33:09,500 --> 02:33:11,500
Thank you.

1226
02:33:11,500 --> 02:33:13,500
Thank you.

1227
02:33:13,500 --> 02:33:15,500
Thank you.

1228
02:33:15,500 --> 02:33:17,500
Thank you.

1229
02:33:17,500 --> 02:33:19,500
Thank you.

1230
02:33:19,500 --> 02:33:21,500
Thank you.

1231
02:33:21,500 --> 02:33:23,500
Thank you.

1232
02:33:23,500 --> 02:33:25,500
Thank you.

1233
02:33:25,500 --> 02:33:27,500
Thank you.

1234
02:33:27,500 --> 02:33:29,500
Thank you.

1235
02:33:29,500 --> 02:33:31,500
Thank you.

1236
02:33:31,500 --> 02:33:33,500
Thank you.

1237
02:33:33,500 --> 02:33:35,500
Thank you.

1238
02:33:35,500 --> 02:33:37,500
Thank you.

1239
02:33:37,500 --> 02:33:39,500
Thank you.

1240
02:33:39,500 --> 02:33:41,500
Thank you.

1241
02:33:41,500 --> 02:33:43,500
Thank you.

1242
02:33:43,500 --> 02:33:45,500
Thank you.

1243
02:33:45,500 --> 02:33:47,500
Thank you.

1244
02:33:47,500 --> 02:33:49,500
Thank you.

1245
02:33:49,500 --> 02:33:51,500
Thank you.

1246
02:33:51,500 --> 02:33:53,500
Thank you.

1247
02:33:53,500 --> 02:33:55,500
Thank you.

1248
02:33:55,500 --> 02:33:57,500
Thank you.

1249
02:33:57,500 --> 02:33:59,500
Thank you.

1250
02:33:59,500 --> 02:34:01,500
Thank you.

1251
02:34:01,500 --> 02:34:03,500
Thank you.

1252
02:34:03,500 --> 02:34:05,500
Thank you.

1253
02:34:05,500 --> 02:34:07,500
Thank you.

1254
02:34:07,500 --> 02:34:09,500
Thank you.

1255
02:34:09,500 --> 02:34:11,500
Thank you.

1256
02:34:11,500 --> 02:34:13,500
Thank you.

1257
02:34:13,500 --> 02:34:15,500
Thank you.

1258
02:34:15,500 --> 02:34:17,500
Thank you.

1259
02:34:17,500 --> 02:34:19,500
Thank you.

1260
02:34:19,500 --> 02:34:21,500
Thank you.

1261
02:34:21,500 --> 02:34:23,500
Thank you.

1262
02:34:23,500 --> 02:34:25,500
Thank you.

1263
02:34:25,500 --> 02:34:27,500
Thank you.

1264
02:34:27,500 --> 02:34:29,500
Thank you.

1265
02:34:29,500 --> 02:34:31,500
Thank you.

1266
02:34:31,500 --> 02:34:33,500
Thank you.

1267
02:34:33,500 --> 02:34:35,500
Thank you.

1268
02:34:35,500 --> 02:34:37,500
Thank you.

1269
02:34:37,500 --> 02:34:39,500
Thank you.

1270
02:34:39,500 --> 02:34:41,500
Thank you.

1271
02:34:41,500 --> 02:34:43,500
Thank you.

1272
02:34:43,500 --> 02:34:45,500
Thank you.

1273
02:34:45,500 --> 02:34:47,500
Thank you.

1274
02:34:47,500 --> 02:34:49,500
Thank you.

1275
02:34:49,500 --> 02:34:51,500
Thank you.

1276
02:34:51,500 --> 02:34:53,500
Thank you.

1277
02:34:53,500 --> 02:34:55,500
Thank you.

1278
02:34:55,500 --> 02:35:01,500
So for the audience, this clock is fast, that clock is slow.

1279
02:35:01,500 --> 02:35:04,000
We'll go by my clock.

1280
02:35:04,000 --> 02:35:06,000
We've got three minutes.

1281
02:35:06,000 --> 02:35:08,000
Thank you.

1282
02:35:08,000 --> 02:35:10,000
Thank you.

1283
02:35:10,000 --> 02:35:16,500
So we're going to call the hearing on House Bill 525 to order.

1284
02:35:16,500 --> 02:35:21,000
I just want to announce it for the committee.

1285
02:35:21,000 --> 02:35:28,000
Representative Major, some of you may know, he had some car trouble this morning.

1286
02:35:28,000 --> 02:35:32,000
His car was overheating, and he got nervous.

1287
02:35:32,000 --> 02:35:38,000
And his local car dealer said they're fully booked until next week.

1288
02:35:38,000 --> 02:35:40,000
It's amazing.

1289
02:35:40,000 --> 02:35:49,000
So he had to scramble and try to find a dealer around here that could help him out.

1290
02:35:49,000 --> 02:35:56,000
So he didn't want to be driving in the nighttime with a car problem.

1291
02:35:56,000 --> 02:35:58,000
So with that...

1292
02:35:58,000 --> 02:36:01,000
Did he buy a new car?

1293
02:36:01,000 --> 02:36:03,000
Maybe.

1294
02:36:03,000 --> 02:36:06,500
I told him to take his antifreeze.

1295
02:36:06,500 --> 02:36:11,500
So the prime sponsor of the bill is Judy Aaron.

1296
02:36:11,500 --> 02:36:13,500
Representative Judy Aaron.

1297
02:36:13,500 --> 02:36:15,500
Representative Judy Aaron.

1298
02:36:15,500 --> 02:36:21,000
We're all getting used to this new sound system and all.

1299
02:36:21,000 --> 02:36:23,000
Good afternoon, Mr.

1300
02:36:23,000 --> 02:36:26,000
Chair and members of the committee.

1301
02:36:26,000 --> 02:36:33,500
Thank you so much for having me come today to introduce this bill, HB 1525.

1302
02:36:33,500 --> 02:36:40,000
I'm introducing this bill to establish a county nursing home capital reserve fund.

1303
02:36:40,000 --> 02:36:46,000
Our county nursing homes are valuable and necessary facilities in our state.

1304
02:36:46,000 --> 02:36:52,500
We have 11 county nursing homes, two of which are in Coloss County.

1305
02:36:52,500 --> 02:37:12,000
While these facilities are not statutorily required, they have long been part of each county's mission to provide health care services to citizens of the county, especially for our elderly population in need of skilled nursing and medical care.

1306
02:37:12,000 --> 02:37:24,000
They provide a home and a place for people to receive nursing care that would otherwise be unavailable to them in their own home.

1307
02:37:24,000 --> 02:37:33,500
And they are an important health care investment and asset to our municipalities, our counties, and to our state.

1308
02:37:33,500 --> 02:37:50,000
With the desire to keep these facilities running and keeping them updated and fully functional for a few counties, we are fast running into maintenance issues and infrastructure as their infrastructure ages out.

1309
02:37:50,000 --> 02:37:59,000
When buildings begin to age out, there are issues with basic infrastructure such as electrical, heating, and plumbing.

1310
02:37:59,000 --> 02:38:08,500
And when maintenance finally becomes a series of band-aids, then it's time to consider renovations and possibly new construction.

1311
02:38:08,500 --> 02:38:10,500
Here's the problem.

1312
02:38:10,500 --> 02:38:18,000
The cost of doing these renovations or new construction has become unmanageable for our counties.

1313
02:38:18,000 --> 02:38:27,500
Counties can no longer determine their own fate with the changes they wish to make when buildings need updating.

1314
02:38:27,500 --> 02:38:48,500
They are at the mercy of federal guidelines, especially the Facilities Guidelines Institute, known as the FGI, which determined for counties the space requirements per resident, as well as for a host of other space requirements for other functions in the facility.

1315
02:38:48,500 --> 02:39:08,500
For example, changes from the 2014 to the 2018 version of FGI added 19 square feet to just one bed space, and when you multiply that to how many beds a facility has, it can mount up quickly in cost.

1316
02:39:08,500 --> 02:39:16,000
Right now, the requirement is for semi-private rooms where two people may share a room.

1317
02:39:16,000 --> 02:39:24,500
You cannot have more people than that, and there are specific requirements for bathroom spaces as well.

1318
02:39:24,500 --> 02:39:33,000
So in any renovation, you have to adhere to these space requirements, and they require a number.

1319
02:39:33,000 --> 02:39:39,500
The FGI also requires a number of bariatric rooms for obese patients too.

1320
02:39:39,500 --> 02:39:53,500
Additionally, it has been noted in a recent preview of their white paper that the next version of FGI will likely require these facilities have private rooms only.

1321
02:39:53,500 --> 02:40:08,000
That being said, we have to also take into account inflation and the cost of labor and materials to do the renovations or new builds in accordance with FGI.

1322
02:40:08,000 --> 02:40:11,000
So what are counties to do?

1323
02:40:11,000 --> 02:40:21,000
They cannot ignore the need for facility upgrades, nor can they continue to put band-aids on infrastructure that's aging out.

1324
02:40:21,000 --> 02:40:36,500
They also don't want to cause county taxes to skyrocket and cause a huge tax burden on citizens, especially since the nursing homes are not the only function that counties provide.

1325
02:40:36,500 --> 02:40:52,000
They also don't want to close the nursing home facilities because people are in need of care, especially as the baby boomer generation is reaching the age of needing these facilities.

1326
02:40:52,000 --> 02:41:08,500
Counties can try and cut renovation or rebuild costs as best, or their rebuild costs as best as possible without compromising quality while adhering to guidelines, but sometimes that just can't be accomplished.

1327
02:41:08,500 --> 02:41:17,500
They also can't go cutting down bed space because that can cause further financial damage to the county.

1328
02:41:17,500 --> 02:41:28,500
So here you have a need to upgrade facilities conflicting with the taxpayers' ability to pay for a very necessary county function.

1329
02:41:28,500 --> 02:41:33,500
This is why counties now need help from the state.

1330
02:41:33,500 --> 02:41:36,500
Our counties are at a crossroads.

1331
02:41:36,500 --> 02:41:50,500
Those counties who are looking to upgrade their facilities can no longer do so for the sums of money that used to be manageable by the county alone.

1332
02:41:50,500 --> 02:42:04,000
The state is in a position to help because of its ability to get grant money from the federal government, as well as income from other sources.

1333
02:42:04,000 --> 02:42:13,000
Now, I know this is an off-budget year, and this is a very challenging ask in this bill.

1334
02:42:13,000 --> 02:42:22,500
But we also have much ARPA money available to be used to help fund this new capital reserve fund.

1335
02:42:22,500 --> 02:42:34,000
And some of that money is destined to be used for upgrading ventilation systems to help mitigate viral transmission and stuff like that.

1336
02:42:34,000 --> 02:42:40,500
So this is a natural good use for much of that ARPA funding.

1337
02:42:40,500 --> 02:43:02,000
So money from ARPA can be utilized to help with viral infection mitigation infrastructure with these renovations and new builds and the state has an interest in keeping these facilities updated and continuing to provide care for the most vulnerable in our society.

1338
02:43:02,000 --> 02:43:09,500
These places are important assets to our state and should be a source of pride.

1339
02:43:09,500 --> 02:43:19,500
The bill I present to you today was modeled after the school building aid program already in place in statute.

1340
02:43:19,500 --> 02:43:30,500
Establishing a County Nursing Home Capital Reserve Fund administered by DHHS is appropriate since DHHS works alongside these County Nursing Home projects.

1341
02:43:30,500 --> 02:43:38,500
They approve plans and make sure the requirements are met and licenses can be kept intact.

1342
02:43:38,500 --> 02:43:48,500
They therefore understand the need, the plans, and the cost of any county nursing home renovation or new build project.

1343
02:43:48,500 --> 02:44:04,500
They can also help determine how much money the project would be eligible for from a fund, such as this, based on the number of beds and who those beds will serve.

1344
02:44:04,500 --> 02:44:10,500
It will be an easy fit for DHHS to administer this fund.

1345
02:44:10,500 --> 02:44:25,500
I'm proposing that the state seeds this fund with $25 million by June 30, 2022 and then continue to fund it with an appropriation of $15 million every year after.

1346
02:44:25,500 --> 02:44:30,500
There's a $30 million cap that I've put on this.

1347
02:44:30,500 --> 02:44:51,500
In addition to DHS applying for any federal grants that may be available and appropriate to be placed into this fund, the point is to have money in this fund to help our counties deal with the escalating costs of upgrading facilities.

1348
02:44:51,500 --> 02:44:53,500
We must do this.

1349
02:44:53,500 --> 02:45:08,000
We must pass this bill and help our counties deal with the cost of keeping these facilities in good working order and to upgrade with the codes and guidelines.

1350
02:45:08,000 --> 02:45:23,000
And otherwise, they will simply close or worse yet, deteriorate into unsafe and horrible places that no one would want to send their loved ones to in their twilight years.

1351
02:45:23,000 --> 02:45:45,500
New Hampshire should take an active part in seeing that these facilities are the best they can be and become a partner with our 10 counties to make sure we can continue to have health care for our elderly that we can be proud of.

1352
02:45:45,500 --> 02:45:54,000
I also want to add that I'm very proud to see a bipartisan support for this bill.

1353
02:45:54,000 --> 02:46:01,500
Everyone should see the importance of making sure that these facilities don't go into ruin.

1354
02:46:01,500 --> 02:46:08,000
And with that, I would be happy to entertain any of your questions.

1355
02:46:08,000 --> 02:46:13,000
First, I want to make a comment to the committee.

1356
02:46:13,000 --> 02:46:15,500
This is a two-committee bill.

1357
02:46:15,500 --> 02:46:24,000
We're looking at the whole thing, but we're here looking at the fund, setting up this fund.

1358
02:46:24,000 --> 02:46:28,000
That's why it came to Ways and Means.

1359
02:46:28,000 --> 02:46:39,000
But then it will be going to finance to address the asks here, the $25 million and then the $15 million thereafter.

1360
02:46:39,000 --> 02:46:41,500
So with that, any questions?

1361
02:46:41,500 --> 02:46:43,500
Representative Schaumburg.

1362
02:46:43,500 --> 02:46:45,500
Thank you, Mr.

1363
02:46:45,500 --> 02:46:50,000
Chairman, and thank you, Representative, for taking my questions.

1364
02:46:50,000 --> 02:46:52,500
It's a three-part question, Mr.

1365
02:46:52,500 --> 02:46:54,500
Chairman.

1366
02:46:54,500 --> 02:47:02,500
Do you know if all the counties have established a capital improvement program by their commissioners?

1367
02:47:02,500 --> 02:47:08,000
I would imagine that would be good practice to do so.

1368
02:47:08,000 --> 02:47:14,000
I don't know for sure, but I would believe that that's true.

1369
02:47:14,000 --> 02:47:20,500
I know Sullivan County, we have a fund that we put money into.

1370
02:47:20,500 --> 02:47:48,000
Thank follow up will the CRF be distributed in equal amounts to all county nursing homes for renovation or new construction I notice there's a number on here that has to be at least five million I think, I believe the way I envision this is we have several counties who have already completed renovations.

1371
02:47:48,000 --> 02:47:52,500
They may not need money for quite a while.

1372
02:47:52,500 --> 02:48:11,000
For those few, one or two, that are looking at doing renovations, they would be discussing their needs with DHHS for funding from this to help them so that they would not have to raise taxes exorbitantly.

1373
02:48:11,000 --> 02:48:22,500
Even if the state could kick in $5-10 million to a project, it relieves a huge burden for the taxpayers of the county.

1374
02:48:22,500 --> 02:48:33,500
And the third follow-up, on line 14, page 2, you mentioned that the state should maybe seed this CRF with $25 million.

1375
02:48:33,500 --> 02:48:41,000
What would be the source, or where would the source of this revenue come from?

1376
02:48:41,000 --> 02:48:49,500
Well, I think that we certainly have sufficient funds coming from what we have with ARPA money.

1377
02:48:49,500 --> 02:48:54,000
I would imagine we could get that from there.

1378
02:48:54,000 --> 02:48:59,500
I've spoken to members of the finance committee ahead of this.

1379
02:48:59,500 --> 02:49:04,000
They said there's plenty of money to be had.

1380
02:49:04,000 --> 02:49:15,000
So I would see that, you know, as the finance committee could probably figure out where they could get that money from.

1381
02:49:15,000 --> 02:49:18,500
Thank you very much for your answers.

1382
02:49:18,500 --> 02:49:20,500
Representative Rulery.

1383
02:49:20,500 --> 02:49:22,500
Thank you, Mr..

1384
02:49:22,500 --> 02:49:42,500
chair thank you for taking my question Hillsborough County capital reserve fund for the nursing home alone somewhere approaching 30 million dollars so would you be taxing the residents of Hillsborough County to fund a nursing home in Coas County?

1385
02:49:42,500 --> 02:49:58,500
I, well, if we would be asking the state to put funds aside in this capital reserve fund, I'm not sure where the source of, you know, that funds would be from.

1386
02:49:58,500 --> 02:50:13,500
Would be from our taxpayers or fees that are paid from out of state or, you know, that's something I think the finance committee would be able to figure out.

1387
02:50:13,500 --> 02:50:15,500
Follow up, Mr.

1388
02:50:15,500 --> 02:50:17,500
Chairman.

1389
02:50:17,500 --> 02:50:42,500
Would you agree with me that not each county needs the same amount of improvement absolutely Merrimack is brand new Rockingham just redid theirs we just put an addition on down in in Gossetown, a new roof, new air conditioner stuff, and we're still using ARPA funds for that directly.

1390
02:50:42,500 --> 02:50:46,500
The counties can apply for ARPA funds directly.

1391
02:50:46,500 --> 02:50:59,000
So would you agree with me that having the state duplicate what the counties can already do as constitutional entities may be duplicative, that word?

1392
02:50:59,000 --> 02:51:01,500
I wouldn't call them duplicative.

1393
02:51:01,500 --> 02:51:13,000
I would call them, you know, that they would be kind of filling a gap that the county can't manage on its own.

1394
02:51:13,000 --> 02:51:27,000
The costs of these renovation projects have become so exorbitant that we're finding, and yes, there are some counties that have already done their renovations, and they're fine.

1395
02:51:27,000 --> 02:51:30,500
They're good for a bunch of years.

1396
02:51:30,500 --> 02:51:35,500
10, 15 years, they wouldn't have to be doing anything.

1397
02:51:35,500 --> 02:51:42,500
But there are county nursing homes that are in dire need, especially Sullivan County.

1398
02:51:42,500 --> 02:51:49,500
You know, we've got a building that's 90 years old that's not functional anymore.

1399
02:51:49,500 --> 02:51:54,500
So we're looking to do a renovation in Sullivan County.

1400
02:51:54,500 --> 02:52:04,500
There may be, you know, with Coas County, they may need something in the next two years or three years.

1401
02:52:04,500 --> 02:52:21,500
The fact is that we have 11 nursing homes, so it's not like you're going to have 100 or, you 100 or all of them all at once asking for money from this fund.

1402
02:52:21,500 --> 02:52:44,500
As these counties come across doing and needing these upgrades and these renovations, they can then apply to, as I said, DHHS is involved in the process anyway, so they would be certainly in touch and in tune with what the needs are for these renovations.

1403
02:52:44,500 --> 02:53:07,500
And indeed, if a county already has a substantial capital reserve fund, I would imagine DHHS would take a look at that and say, well, you already have $30 million at your disposal, so you don't need $30 million from us or $10 million from us.

1404
02:53:07,500 --> 02:53:10,500
We just want to make up...

1405
02:53:10,500 --> 02:53:26,000
I just want the state to help and maybe provide some gap funding to help these counties be able to afford these renovations because they are so exorbitant in cost now.

1406
02:53:26,000 --> 02:53:28,000
Thank you, Mr.

1407
02:53:28,000 --> 02:53:30,000
Chairman.

1408
02:53:30,000 --> 02:53:33,500
Representative Ames and then Representative Jude Garion.

1409
02:53:33,500 --> 02:53:35,500
Hi, I'm Representative Ames.

1410
02:53:35,500 --> 02:53:38,000
So I'm from Cheshire County.

1411
02:53:38,000 --> 02:53:49,500
We've just finished building, rebuilding but expanding a very fine nursing home, Maplewood Nursing Home, which five years ago was in bad shape.

1412
02:53:49,500 --> 02:53:54,500
Overheated rooms from poor ventilation and all sorts of problems.

1413
02:53:54,500 --> 02:53:58,000
I can't even begin to catalog them.

1414
02:53:58,000 --> 02:54:17,000
And over a period of time, with the leadership provided by the county commissioners and by the legislative delegation, county administrator, and particularly the nursing home administrator, I should add, a plan was developed to redo this facility.

1415
02:54:17,000 --> 02:54:24,000
And now it's happened to the tune of about, well, it's above $30 million.

1416
02:54:24,000 --> 02:54:28,500
Representative Gamarlo may have a better number than me.

1417
02:54:28,500 --> 02:54:31,000
She's also from Cheshire County.

1418
02:54:31,000 --> 02:54:33,000
But above $30 million.

1419
02:54:33,000 --> 02:54:39,500
And that's been covered by the taxpayers of the towns in Cheshire County.

1420
02:54:39,500 --> 02:54:45,000
So now we've got a very fine, very modern nursing home.

1421
02:54:45,000 --> 02:54:53,500
Not as full as it should be because we can't hire staff, but that's a different issue.

1422
02:54:53,500 --> 02:55:27,500
and so why would I as a representative of some but that's a different issue and so why would I as a representative of some segment of the taxpayers in Cheshire County support something like this where other counties should be able to we would say devise a way with prudent savings, capital improvement programs, and so forth, a way to do the same thing that we did.

1423
02:55:27,500 --> 02:55:31,000
Thank you for your question, Representative Ames.

1424
02:55:31,000 --> 02:55:44,000
I am aware of the renovations that Cheshire County made to their nursing home facility, and I commend them for the beautiful job that they did.

1425
02:55:44,000 --> 02:55:59,000
I would like to make it known though that if you were to do those renovations now under the current FGI, it would probably cost you 30% more in costs.

1426
02:55:59,000 --> 02:56:03,500
And what we're seeing happening is just this escalation.

1427
02:56:03,500 --> 02:56:10,000
Sullivan County Nursing Home, we are looking at a $50 million dollar project.

1428
02:56:10,000 --> 02:56:16,000
And that kind of renovation, yes, we've put money aside for it.

1429
02:56:16,000 --> 02:56:18,000
We've saved for it.

1430
02:56:18,000 --> 02:56:32,000
But as these renovation costs escalate with inflation and scarcity of supply, it just becomes a little bit, it's sort of like we're chasing this escalation in costs.

1431
02:56:32,000 --> 02:56:43,500
And it's becoming more and more difficult to be able to do, for counties to be able to do these renovations without help.

1432
02:56:43,500 --> 02:56:48,000
And so what happens is, how long can you?

1433
02:56:48,000 --> 02:57:12,500
Putting band-aids on infrastructure that's failing While you're putting aside money and saving Because what's happening is we're ending up having to take that capital reserve dollars to put towards these band-aids instead of putting them aside to save and Actually do the renovations that need to be done.

1434
02:57:12,500 --> 02:57:29,500
And further to your point, if it were to be that Cheshire County Nursing Home was full and needed space for residents, they could probably come up and use space up in Sullivan County.

1435
02:57:29,500 --> 02:57:41,500
It's, you know, travel distance would be more, but if the facilities are available, that's where, you know, people may be able to go.

1436
02:57:41,500 --> 02:57:43,500
Yeah.

1437
02:57:43,500 --> 02:58:22,000
I don't think we're debating the need for the nursing home beds, and it certainly should be a sharing system and I guess I'm wondering if there isn't some way to the extent to which there is an agreement that a fund like this may be needed to have in it a local share requirement or something that ensures that everybody's doing their fair share of what it takes to build or to rebuild or to renovate.

1438
02:58:22,000 --> 02:58:43,500
In other words, if the next county, Sullivan, knocks on the door, gets 100% of the cost, yeah, it's a greater cost, but if they got that and the next door county down, Cheshire County, had paid for it all, it seems unfair.

1439
02:58:43,500 --> 02:58:57,000
But maybe there's a way of digging into that and ensuring that what we're talking about is a boost from the state rather than the whole thing.

1440
02:58:57,000 --> 02:59:10,000
And thank you for that comment because the intention of this is not for the state to pay the entire cost of a renovation or rebuild.

1441
02:59:10,000 --> 02:59:32,000
The intention is to help a county fill the gap that they cannot raise taxes for or would find that raising taxes, that there would be a portion of that cost that the state could kick in for, not the entire cost at all.

1442
02:59:32,000 --> 02:59:35,000
Representative Janagi and then Representative Ami.

1443
02:59:35,000 --> 02:59:37,000
Thank you, Mr.

1444
02:59:37,000 --> 02:59:39,000
Chairman.

1445
02:59:39,000 --> 02:59:42,000
Thank you for taking my question.

1446
02:59:42,000 --> 02:59:54,000
You said Sullivan County has already put some money aside, and you said it looks like the cost of renovation is about $50 million.

1447
02:59:54,000 --> 03:00:05,000
Have you looked into ARPA money, and is the ARPA money plus what you've put aside close to what you would need?

1448
03:00:05,000 --> 03:00:07,000
Yeah.

1449
03:00:07,000 --> 03:00:14,000
Well, when the county manager comes to give his testimony, he can clarify that.

1450
03:00:14,000 --> 03:00:47,000
But, yes a Sullivan County received I believe eight million dollars in ARPA funds which is far less than many other counties received and a good portion of that will be going towards the renovation of the of the nursing home facility but the county itself is very limited as to how much of the you know how much ARPA funding they were able to receive.

1451
03:00:47,000 --> 03:00:55,500
And we've put that money alongside with money that we've saved in our own capital reserve funds.

1452
03:00:55,500 --> 03:00:59,000
It just isn't going to be enough.

1453
03:00:59,000 --> 03:01:02,000
And we're also looking at bonding.

1454
03:01:02,000 --> 03:01:07,000
Certainly you want to bond a portion of this too.

1455
03:01:07,000 --> 03:01:19,000
But if we were to go out and bond for the whole remaining amount, the county tax rate would just be a huge increase.

1456
03:01:19,000 --> 03:01:21,000
Thank you.

1457
03:01:21,000 --> 03:01:23,000
Representative Almey.

1458
03:01:23,000 --> 03:01:25,000
Thank you, Mr.

1459
03:01:25,000 --> 03:01:27,000
Chairman.

1460
03:01:27,000 --> 03:01:42,000
The thing that worries me about this is that most dedicated funds, which is what you're asking us to talk about, is the trust fund, the dedicated fund for this.

1461
03:01:42,000 --> 03:02:04,500
They are funded by some revenue source other than the general fund, which, I mean, if this bill asks for it to come from whatever surplus there is that the governor can find, and we aren't going to be having surpluses in a few years.

1462
03:02:04,500 --> 03:02:21,500
When we stop getting the federal money and you've cut the taxes, there are more taxes that are trying to be cut this year as well, that surplus is not going to be there.

1463
03:02:21,500 --> 03:02:36,500
So the question is, we've already got an affordable housing commitment of $5 million a year that got put into the budget, which is housing for everybody in the state.

1464
03:02:36,500 --> 03:02:42,000
This one is asking for up to $15 million every year.

1465
03:02:42,000 --> 03:03:05,000
and it seems like it's going it would require intolerable cuts in a lot of other services which the towns then as usual have to make up with their own services or face the wrath of their constituents it's that's why our property tax keeps rising.

1466
03:03:05,000 --> 03:03:14,000
So I just, this is my problem with it, and I'm wondering if you can help me out.

1467
03:03:14,000 --> 03:03:16,000
Sure.

1468
03:03:16,000 --> 03:03:19,500
Thank you so much for that question.

1469
03:03:19,500 --> 03:03:27,500
And what I've done here is I put a cap on this fund of $30 million.

1470
03:03:27,500 --> 03:03:40,500
So you would not necessarily have to add $15 million every year after, you know, $25 million to begin with and then $15 million every year.

1471
03:03:40,500 --> 03:03:48,500
But if there's $30 million in the fund, you don't have to put any money in.

1472
03:03:48,500 --> 03:04:00,000
And being that we have 11 county nursing homes, I don't see that there's going to be requests for money every single year.

1473
03:04:00,000 --> 03:04:15,000
Because, you know, if a nursing facility has completed their renovations or their rebuild or whatever, there would be no need for them to ask for money from the fund.

1474
03:04:15,000 --> 03:04:22,500
I think it's just for these exorbitant projects that are in process or being contemplated.

1475
03:04:22,500 --> 03:04:37,500
And I think we can kind of plan out, based on the number of nursing homes that are gonna be needing some sort of funding in the next 10 years.

1476
03:04:37,500 --> 03:04:48,000
But again, I put a cap on this fund so that you don't have to put money in every single year.

1477
03:04:48,000 --> 03:04:50,000
Representative Camarlo.

1478
03:04:50,000 --> 03:04:52,000
Thank you, Mr.

1479
03:04:52,000 --> 03:04:54,000
Chair.

1480
03:04:54,000 --> 03:05:05,000
Can you explain how the paragraph beginning at line 28, funds shall be allocated using the long-term care beds in the county?

1481
03:05:05,000 --> 03:05:07,000
How does that work?

1482
03:05:07,000 --> 03:05:15,500
And is it the existing beds or the beds that would be coming into the new project?

1483
03:05:15,500 --> 03:05:17,500
I don't know.

1484
03:05:17,500 --> 03:05:21,500
I just don't understand quite how that works.

1485
03:05:21,500 --> 03:05:34,500
Well, we wanted to put in some sort of way in which we could establish the amount of money that would be coming to a project.

1486
03:05:34,500 --> 03:06:06,000
And it made sense to figure it out by What the long-term beds in that county the count of that is because that kind of gives you a sense of what the need is for that particular project or for the county and so we looked at that as being the long-term beds in the county that are in the nursing home facility.

1487
03:06:06,000 --> 03:06:19,500
And if you're licensed for, say, 156 beds, I don't think that you're going to be asking for more money than what you already have license for.

1488
03:06:19,500 --> 03:06:34,500
so it just seemed to be sort of a benchmark that we could use to determine how much money a particular project may be able to get from the fund.

1489
03:06:34,500 --> 03:06:36,500
And you might...

1490
03:06:36,500 --> 03:06:47,000
Our county director of our nursing home may be able to explain that in a little bit more detail as well.

1491
03:06:47,000 --> 03:06:55,000
As a follow-up, do you think there might be a need for a cap per county?

1492
03:06:55,000 --> 03:07:07,000
Isn't it feasible without some kind of a cap that if one county needed money one year, they could use the whole $30 million?

1493
03:07:07,000 --> 03:07:11,000
I suppose we could consider that in this.

1494
03:07:11,000 --> 03:07:13,000
Okay.

1495
03:07:13,000 --> 03:07:15,000
Thank you.

1496
03:07:15,000 --> 03:07:17,000
Any other questions?

1497
03:07:17,000 --> 03:07:19,000
I see no hands.

1498
03:07:19,000 --> 03:07:21,000
Thank you very much.

1499
03:07:21,000 --> 03:07:26,500
Thank you very much, and I appreciate your consideration on this.

1500
03:07:26,500 --> 03:07:28,500
Representative Stapleton.

1501
03:07:28,500 --> 03:07:30,500
Good afternoon, Mr.

1502
03:07:30,500 --> 03:07:32,500
Chair and Committee.

1503
03:07:32,500 --> 03:07:37,000
Walter Stapleton, Sullivan County District 5, Claremont Ward 3.

1504
03:07:37,000 --> 03:08:19,500
I'm a co-sponsor and a supporter of this bill, and I've heard from many of our constituents, Sullivan County, Claremont has a large proportion of seniors that are concerned about their future as they age and are going to require more care and in the facility setting like we have at Sullivan County Nursing Home we've been working on this for several years and we've got three facilities one built 1930 another in the 70s and the latest the latest one in the early 90s.

1505
03:08:19,500 --> 03:08:24,000
The oldest one in 1930 is no longer usable.

1506
03:08:24,000 --> 03:08:30,000
It's out of code, it's out of spec, and it's not suitable.

1507
03:08:30,000 --> 03:08:34,500
It's just not suitable for patient occupancy and care.

1508
03:08:34,500 --> 03:08:50,500
When we started the project, you know, we were looking at the 20, 30 million dollar field and then comes COVID and all of a sudden building materials are going sky high.

1509
03:08:50,500 --> 03:08:54,000
Labor is a shortage, a severe shortage.

1510
03:08:54,000 --> 03:09:01,500
And when we've got the re-quote from the contractor, we were up to $54 million.

1511
03:09:01,500 --> 03:09:08,500
Now, I understand that there are, you know, it's tough running county nursing homes.

1512
03:09:08,500 --> 03:09:18,000
And I understand that most of our nursing homes are having trouble breaking even and some working at deficit.

1513
03:09:18,000 --> 03:09:29,000
Sullivan County hasn't got the population that Merrimack does or other counties downstate and the load would otherwise fall onto the taxpayers.

1514
03:09:29,000 --> 03:09:36,500
But along with COVID comes also CARES, ARPA and infrastructure and jobs in the work.

1515
03:09:36,500 --> 03:09:53,000
And I would suspect that money from ARPA and infrastructure, if and when it can pass and come down, will come to the state, and that is a source of money for this.

1516
03:09:53,000 --> 03:10:01,500
And we hope that this bill and the reserve will provide a component, not the whole nut.

1517
03:10:01,500 --> 03:10:12,000
We don't anticipate asking for $25 million to relieve the $54 million cost or mitigate it, but a component of it.

1518
03:10:12,000 --> 03:10:14,500
And how to measure that?

1519
03:10:14,500 --> 03:10:16,500
How about proportionality?

1520
03:10:16,500 --> 03:10:19,000
We got 156 bed allocation.

1521
03:10:19,000 --> 03:10:22,500
Other counties may have more or less.

1522
03:10:22,500 --> 03:10:30,500
how about putting a cap on these in a proportional manner to the bed service allocation.

1523
03:10:30,500 --> 03:10:41,000
Constituents have asked me to support the county home rehabilitation, and I haven't got one constituent who was opposed to it.

1524
03:10:41,000 --> 03:10:54,000
And as I said, we have a growing senior population, and they're concerned where they're going to be, and they want to stay in the community.

1525
03:10:54,000 --> 03:11:01,500
And I suppose this is something that's a concern of seniors all over the state.

1526
03:11:01,500 --> 03:11:38,000
And I would suggest that a statewide approach to this with this reserve bill is a good way to get started with it not unlike what we faced with the school adequacy and funding issue yeah I know we've got wealthy or donor towns and we've also got towns and cities in need and so the state stepping in to balance and mitigate those needs and assist is where we're headed with education.

1527
03:11:38,000 --> 03:11:51,000
I suggest that with the county homes this is an important component of our society and we need to do similar or the same with that.

1528
03:11:51,000 --> 03:11:59,000
Out of the three facilities, as I say, we've only got two that are really functional.

1529
03:11:59,000 --> 03:12:08,500
The third one, 1930, is actually going to be demolished because it's only suitable for storage and office space.

1530
03:12:08,500 --> 03:12:11,500
And the 1970s unit needs upgrade.

1531
03:12:11,500 --> 03:12:13,500
It's under par.

1532
03:12:13,500 --> 03:13:07,000
And how would any of us like to go into a facility in our older age that is not adequate or suitable for the proper care of patients the 1992 1990s facility is better shape but it still needs modifications to come up to code and the codes are always changing and they're always getting more stringent the county people here can testify more to that in detail because that's what they're working with every day but I'm asking the committee to consider the wider scope of the options and the needs that we have here this is a state concern concern, not just a local one.

1533
03:13:07,000 --> 03:13:16,500
And if we can strengthen nursing homes statewide, sure, I'm looking for Sullivan County because that's what I represent.

1534
03:13:16,500 --> 03:13:31,500
But if we can do this on a statewide basis with this particular bill as a starting point, I think we'd be well served to address needs in the future.

1535
03:13:31,500 --> 03:13:36,500
And that's all I really can say at this point.

1536
03:13:36,500 --> 03:13:38,500
Okay, thank you.

1537
03:13:38,500 --> 03:13:40,500
Any questions from members?

1538
03:13:40,500 --> 03:13:42,500
I see no questions.

1539
03:13:42,500 --> 03:13:45,000
Thank you very much, Representative.

1540
03:13:45,000 --> 03:13:47,000
Appreciate it.

1541
03:13:47,000 --> 03:13:49,500
I had one more point.

1542
03:13:49,500 --> 03:13:52,000
I'm sorry, I lost track.

1543
03:13:52,000 --> 03:14:01,500
We talked with the offices of Senator Hassan and Shaheen, and they're working on ARPA and the infrastructure bill.

1544
03:14:01,500 --> 03:14:10,500
And in the detail, the infrastructure bill, there wasn't specifically a place for nursing homes and medical infrastructure.

1545
03:14:10,500 --> 03:14:21,500
But they were going to work to open that up as they got the working on the bill and refined it more.

1546
03:14:21,500 --> 03:14:34,500
So if that can be passed, then we have another source to fund the state in order to administer and to fund this particular reserve account.

1547
03:14:34,500 --> 03:14:36,500
Okay, thank you.

1548
03:14:36,500 --> 03:14:38,500
Thank you.

1549
03:14:38,500 --> 03:14:41,500
Okay, we have one more representative.

1550
03:14:41,500 --> 03:14:43,500
Representative Clodier.

1551
03:14:43,500 --> 03:14:45,500
Yep, there you are.

1552
03:14:45,500 --> 03:14:50,000
I'm going to take my mask off to testify.

1553
03:14:50,000 --> 03:14:52,500
So can everybody hear me?

1554
03:14:52,500 --> 03:14:54,500
Thank you, Mr.

1555
03:14:54,500 --> 03:14:56,500
Chairman.

1556
03:14:56,500 --> 03:15:06,500
For the record, I'm State Representative John Cloutier from Sullivan County District 10, which comprises the entire city of Claremont.

1557
03:15:06,500 --> 03:15:33,000
And I'm here today to testify in favor and as a co-sponsor of House Bill 1525 establishing a county nursing home capital reserve fund and first of all I want to take applaud Representative Aaron the prime sponsor for initiative in sponsoring this bipartisan bill and I'm very pleased to be a co-sponsor.

1558
03:15:33,000 --> 03:15:42,000
As Representative Aaron and Representative Stapleton have alluded to, I mean we've had our problems with Sullivan County.

1559
03:15:42,000 --> 03:15:53,500
This is one of the reasons this bill came about, but this bill can benefit the entire state, all of our nursing homes.

1560
03:15:53,500 --> 03:16:02,500
And remember we have 11 nursing homes, one for each county in the case of Coas County, two.

1561
03:16:02,500 --> 03:16:32,500
And this is a real problem and I sort of liken this bill to what we have the school building aid fund where school building aid fund helps build design facilities for people our citizens who are in the dawn of life this fund if it was established would help our citizens who are in the sunset of their lives.

1562
03:16:32,500 --> 03:16:40,000
I I think we all agree we need to take care of our senior citizens.

1563
03:16:40,000 --> 03:16:52,000
And I know some of you who may have just had new nursing homes renovated or completed and say, why should I support this?

1564
03:16:52,000 --> 03:16:55,000
Because we're being taken care of.

1565
03:16:55,000 --> 03:16:57,500
This is for the future.

1566
03:16:57,500 --> 03:16:59,500
This benefits us all.

1567
03:16:59,500 --> 03:17:08,000
Who knows what can happen down the road, even though you may have built a new facility.

1568
03:17:08,000 --> 03:17:16,500
Who knows, maybe a bad storm hurricane could devastate your nursing home, and you may need help.

1569
03:17:16,500 --> 03:17:26,500
Or you may want to build, because of demand, a larger facility, either an addition or even a separate facility.

1570
03:17:26,500 --> 03:17:31,500
This bill I'd foreseen as maybe help in the future.

1571
03:17:31,500 --> 03:18:07,000
So it would all county nursing homes not just Sullivan County but we've had our struggles in Sullivan County as delegation chair this term this is and I've been chair several terms the most one of the most divisive issues I've ever ever had to deal with and I see both sides I see the need for a new nursing facility and a lot of my constituents have told me that.

1572
03:18:07,000 --> 03:18:18,000
But I also hear from constituents that says we cannot afford this brand new nursing home at a $50 million price tag.

1573
03:18:18,000 --> 03:18:20,000
It's unsustainable.

1574
03:18:20,000 --> 03:18:25,000
So I'm just, we are working now as a delegation.

1575
03:18:25,000 --> 03:18:27,000
We finally came together.

1576
03:18:27,000 --> 03:18:38,500
We established a nursing home work group consisting of four members of the delegation and a commissioner to try to work something out.

1577
03:18:38,500 --> 03:18:41,500
And we're still undergoing that process.

1578
03:18:41,500 --> 03:18:50,000
I've been involved in this for nearly four years when I was first approached about this issue.

1579
03:18:50,000 --> 03:18:57,000
This is a serious issue, and we really need some state help with this.

1580
03:18:57,000 --> 03:19:07,000
and another thing philosophically, the state doesn't, the counties, excuse me, don't have to establish and run county nursing homes.

1581
03:19:07,000 --> 03:19:09,500
It's my understanding, it's optional.

1582
03:19:09,500 --> 03:19:17,000
What if all of a sudden our counties got out of the nursing home business?

1583
03:19:17,000 --> 03:19:23,500
Where would our people go who maybe need some help, those on Medicaid?

1584
03:19:23,500 --> 03:19:33,500
Something would have to happen, and the state would probably have to step in, maybe at a more expensive cost.

1585
03:19:33,500 --> 03:19:56,500
So I think we've got to think about this, and we've got to help our counties, a lot of whom are, I can't speak for all counties, but I know Sullivan, among others, and maybe, you know, Coas, and maybe some of the others are struggling.

1586
03:19:56,500 --> 03:20:06,500
We need help from the state of New Hampshire, and this is one of the ways we can do it.

1587
03:20:06,500 --> 03:20:10,000
And I think it's a reasonable bill.

1588
03:20:10,000 --> 03:20:15,500
As far as revenue, right now we've got plenty of revenue.

1589
03:20:15,500 --> 03:20:28,500
I know down the road we're going to have to maybe deal with needed revenue, and maybe we need to establish a dedicated fund on this.

1590
03:20:28,500 --> 03:20:31,500
Remember, these are our senior citizens.

1591
03:20:31,500 --> 03:20:39,000
We're all, you know, if we live long, we're all headed in the same direction.

1592
03:20:39,000 --> 03:20:45,500
So I want to be taken care of when I reach that age.

1593
03:20:45,500 --> 03:20:59,000
And I know it's very personal to me because I remember as a kid visiting the Sullivan County Nursing Home 60 years ago to visit my great-grandmother.

1594
03:20:59,000 --> 03:21:16,000
I remember one of the buildings that is now closed, my great-grandmother was in there, and then she was moved to the Sanders building, which is the main target of this proposed renovation project.

1595
03:21:16,000 --> 03:21:21,000
She was one of the first new people in there.

1596
03:21:21,000 --> 03:21:34,000
This is very, I expect I'll probably be going there, you know, if nobody can take care of any more, and I can live long enough.

1597
03:21:34,000 --> 03:21:44,500
So I really think we've got to do something about our nursing homes and give them a little bit of help.

1598
03:21:44,500 --> 03:21:52,500
And I don't think Representative Aaron and the rest of us are asking for very much.

1599
03:21:52,500 --> 03:22:00,500
So I hope you'll give this bill 1525 serious consideration and approve it in some form.

1600
03:22:00,500 --> 03:22:02,500
Thank you very much.

1601
03:22:02,500 --> 03:22:04,500
Mr.

1602
03:22:04,500 --> 03:22:07,000
Chairman, members of the committee.

1603
03:22:07,000 --> 03:22:13,000
Representative Cooley, I actually have a question I should have asked earlier.

1604
03:22:13,000 --> 03:22:21,500
So the project has to be $5 million or more, is what I read in the bill.

1605
03:22:21,500 --> 03:22:23,500
Yeah, that's correct.

1606
03:22:23,500 --> 03:22:25,500
It is written.

1607
03:22:25,500 --> 03:22:32,000
And so it's not going to, you know, I think that's reasonable fiscally.

1608
03:22:32,000 --> 03:22:39,000
It just doesn't fund any sort of facility that costs less than $5 million.

1609
03:22:39,000 --> 03:22:44,500
Right, but there's no cap on the grant that can be.

1610
03:22:44,500 --> 03:22:48,500
I don't see any limitation on the grant.

1611
03:22:48,500 --> 03:22:59,500
Is that something that would come out of rules, something that is going to leave up to HHS to make that decision?

1612
03:22:59,500 --> 03:23:01,500
There's no cap.

1613
03:23:01,500 --> 03:23:03,500
I can't speculate.

1614
03:23:03,500 --> 03:23:15,000
Of course, it may be if you as a committee wanted to amend it to put in some sort of cap or guidelines.

1615
03:23:15,000 --> 03:23:18,000
I mean, I would be open.

1616
03:23:18,000 --> 03:23:29,500
I can't speak for the rest of the co-sponsors, but I would be open to it in order to get the bill passed.

1617
03:23:29,500 --> 03:23:41,000
So I can see your point because you don't want to, you know, we should be careful about spending a lot of money.

1618
03:23:41,000 --> 03:23:43,500
We have to be careful.

1619
03:23:43,500 --> 03:23:57,500
And if you put in some caps as part of an amendment, I'd be open to it, as I said, but I can't speak for the other co-sponsors.

1620
03:23:57,500 --> 03:23:59,500
Okay.

1621
03:23:59,500 --> 03:24:02,500
Well, thank you for that answer.

1622
03:24:02,500 --> 03:24:04,500
Oh, you're welcome.

1623
03:24:04,500 --> 03:24:06,500
Okay.

1624
03:24:06,500 --> 03:24:08,500
Any other questions?

1625
03:24:08,500 --> 03:24:10,500
Representative Almey.

1626
03:24:10,500 --> 03:24:12,500
Thank you.

1627
03:24:12,500 --> 03:24:16,500
Do you know this Federal Guidelines Institute, too?

1628
03:24:16,500 --> 03:24:30,500
Grafton put in, we put in a new wing of the nursing home, and we turned the oldest wing into administrative offices, and we upgraded the middle wing.

1629
03:24:30,500 --> 03:24:49,000
It was extremely painful to have to pay for that, and we all voted at the request of the head of the delegation, who was an engineer and a friend of mine and a very strong Republican.

1630
03:24:49,000 --> 03:24:53,000
We all voted to cut the cost down.

1631
03:24:53,000 --> 03:25:11,500
Nobody mentioned anything about an FGI, but in fact, we had to pay, I think it was three times what we'd saved in cutting that cost down because we did some very stupid things in the cutting.

1632
03:25:11,500 --> 03:25:25,000
And I was just wondering if this Federal Guidelines Institute is a new thing that is overseeing the counties or whether it's been there a long time.

1633
03:25:25,000 --> 03:25:34,500
And if anybody is doing anything to try to get them to do cost-benefit analysis as they do this.

1634
03:25:34,500 --> 03:25:37,000
Okay, thank you, Representative Almey.

1635
03:25:37,000 --> 03:25:48,000
I'm not sure, hopefully there'd be people behind me who will come afterwards who will be able to answer the question better.

1636
03:25:48,000 --> 03:25:52,500
I'll admit I am not an expert on that.

1637
03:25:52,500 --> 03:26:02,000
I realize there's certain federal guidelines, which I think sometimes are, you know, you'll wonder whether they're worth it.

1638
03:26:02,000 --> 03:26:15,000
And so hopefully they would be able to answer that question better because, yes, some of these federal are driving up the cost of nursing homes.

1639
03:26:15,000 --> 03:26:18,500
And, of course, it's a real pain.

1640
03:26:18,500 --> 03:26:31,500
I mean, I also feel, I don't know, the federal government, if they put in all these mandates, maybe they ought to kick in more money.

1641
03:26:31,500 --> 03:26:35,500
But that's an issue we're not in Congress.

1642
03:26:35,500 --> 03:26:39,500
We're at the New Hampshire House, of course.

1643
03:26:39,500 --> 03:27:16,500
Representative, we have three members in Sutherland County that are going to speak so they may have an answer any follow-up I did if I could just one slightly different question you compared it with the education the the school school building it's a rough building aid and the problem with the school building aid idea was that the richest towns were the ones that could pass the warrant articles and build new buildings.

1644
03:27:16,500 --> 03:27:25,500
So we ended up with Salem, for instance, having this palace that I was invited to see once.

1645
03:27:25,500 --> 03:27:37,000
and a lot of towns, including mine, until the last minute, not being able to do anything about any of our school buildings.

1646
03:27:37,000 --> 03:27:52,500
Okay, I wasn't aware of that, Representative, about the problems with the school building aid fund, so it's something that, considering this bill, I guess you've got to consider the details.

1647
03:27:52,500 --> 03:27:57,500
And I don't know, making maybe some suggested language changes.

1648
03:27:57,500 --> 03:28:01,000
Of course, I'm always speaking for myself.

1649
03:28:01,000 --> 03:28:03,000
I mean, I'm open.

1650
03:28:03,000 --> 03:28:10,000
But I think the important thing is to get this nursing home fund created.

1651
03:28:10,000 --> 03:28:21,500
And I think the important thing is to get the principle started, to get it started and get it off to a start.

1652
03:28:21,500 --> 03:28:27,000
And I mean, I think this bill is for the future.

1653
03:28:27,000 --> 03:28:40,500
I mean, maybe the real positive of this are going to be felt years and years after we're all along and gone, at least from this house.

1654
03:28:40,500 --> 03:28:53,000
But I think we've got to make, as a state, realize that we have an important investment in all 11 of our county nursing homes.

1655
03:28:53,000 --> 03:29:16,000
And I think we'd all like to continue because if the counties, you know, don't stay in the nursing home business, we're probably going to have a lot of problems in this state, frankly, because I don't know who's going to pick up the ball, frankly.

1656
03:29:16,000 --> 03:29:21,500
So I'm more than happy, I think, to consult with you.

1657
03:29:21,500 --> 03:29:33,500
I think all the rest of the prime sponsor and the co-sponsor are more than willing to work with you on amending this bill.

1658
03:29:33,500 --> 03:29:48,500
But the important thing is to iron out the details to get to the principle, I think, which we as all the sponsors want, creation of a capital reserve fund.

1659
03:29:48,500 --> 03:29:55,500
So I don't know if I answered your question, but I see your point.

1660
03:29:55,500 --> 03:29:57,500
Any other questions?

1661
03:29:57,500 --> 03:29:59,500
Oh, yes, Representative Malloy.

1662
03:29:59,500 --> 03:30:01,500
I'm sorry.

1663
03:30:01,500 --> 03:30:03,500
Thank you, Mr.

1664
03:30:03,500 --> 03:30:05,500
Chair.

1665
03:30:05,500 --> 03:30:09,000
Thank you, Representative, for taking my question.

1666
03:30:09,000 --> 03:30:11,000
Oh, you're welcome.

1667
03:30:11,000 --> 03:30:20,500
And I'm looking at page two, line four, where you talk about adopting the rules pursuant to RSA 541-a.

1668
03:30:20,500 --> 03:30:23,000
Okay, this is page 2.

1669
03:30:23,000 --> 03:30:26,000
Page 2, line 4, Roman numeral.

1670
03:30:26,000 --> 03:30:28,000
Roman, okay.

1671
03:30:28,000 --> 03:30:30,000
Yeah.

1672
03:30:30,000 --> 03:30:32,000
I'm sorry.

1673
03:30:32,000 --> 03:30:34,000
That's okay.

1674
03:30:34,000 --> 03:30:43,000
I admittedly, I've not read RSA 541-a, how to develop grant application forms, procedure, that kind of thing.

1675
03:30:43,000 --> 03:31:14,000
I just would, and there may not be an answer to this, that's fine but I was wondering if in there or if you've talked about this among your group that there's a opportunity for matching grant matching funds to for to move forward and you know prime the pump for some of this money that's all that's all that's all my.

1676
03:31:14,000 --> 03:31:16,500
I'm not sure the group.

1677
03:31:16,500 --> 03:31:33,000
I mean, I know we have our nursing home working group, so maybe some of the reps that have been involved and commissioners and county may be able to help answer that question.

1678
03:31:33,000 --> 03:31:38,500
I assume we're looking at everything as far as matching grants.

1679
03:31:38,500 --> 03:31:53,500
In fact, I know one public official encouraged us to do like the hospitals do, establish a capital campaign fund, and I don't know whether we're considering that or not.

1680
03:31:53,500 --> 03:31:56,500
We're looking, I think, at everything.

1681
03:31:56,500 --> 03:32:05,000
I mean, the federal government, the state government, whatever we can do to help fund our nursing.

1682
03:32:05,000 --> 03:32:13,500
And we don't expect, you know, the state and federal government to pick up all the costs.

1683
03:32:13,500 --> 03:32:36,000
But I think we need some help, frankly, because the counties are doing the work of the state when it comes to nursing homes and I just feel strongly we need to the state needs to do a little bit more to help them out.

1684
03:32:36,000 --> 03:32:38,000
You're welcome.

1685
03:32:38,000 --> 03:32:40,000
Any other questions?

1686
03:32:40,000 --> 03:32:42,000
Thank you very much.

1687
03:32:42,000 --> 03:32:45,000
Okay thank you very much Mr.

1688
03:32:45,000 --> 03:32:47,000
Chairman.

1689
03:32:47,000 --> 03:32:52,500
I misspoke there were actually four representatives that wanted to speak.

1690
03:32:52,500 --> 03:33:04,000
Do you to speak represent Sullivan come on up representative Brian Sullivan Sullivan County District 1 which is Cornish Springfield Plainfield and Grantham.

1691
03:33:04,000 --> 03:33:12,000
And speaking to the federal codes that are in place, those actually took effect in 2019.

1692
03:33:12,000 --> 03:33:18,000
So partway through the process of designing the renovation, the codes changed.

1693
03:33:18,000 --> 03:33:22,500
And at that point, the price went up substantially.

1694
03:33:22,500 --> 03:33:33,500
As has been said earlier, when we first started looking at this, we were looking at about $35 million for renovation cost.

1695
03:33:33,500 --> 03:34:18,500
When the cost came in at $54 million, that cost was put in front of the delegation and it was voted down overwhelmingly I think there was only one vote in favor of going forward over the course of months that followed two lines of thinking developed one was we've got to find a way to get these costs down because 54 million dollars is outrageous the other line line of thinking is we need to go forward as quickly as possible because the nursing home is in dire need.

1696
03:34:18,500 --> 03:34:20,500
Both groups were right.

1697
03:34:20,500 --> 03:34:26,000
And however, we struggled mightily with the conflict in the delegation.

1698
03:34:26,000 --> 03:34:55,500
eventually we did put together a work group as representative Kludier discussed and I was asked to chair that work group representative Aaron was on that work group as well along with two other reps and a commissioner we did a deep dive into ways in which we could cut costs on this, ways we could change the design.

1699
03:34:55,500 --> 03:36:52,500
But due to the constraints put on us by the federal government, we came to the conclusion that in order to maintain what we needed for the county and what our seniors needed from us, there was no practical way to substantially cut the costs so we ended up with the same design moving forward again and we are now waiting for a cost estimate prior to actually going forward with with a bond or a re-bidding of the process so what we were unanimous about I think all along some perhaps didn't believe it but I think we all believed that the nursing home needed to be upgraded we needed to take care of our seniors what we concluded through the process was that there was no practical way of reducing the cost of the project or the scope of the project in a way that would bring the price down substantially in the end we had a unanimous vote of the workgroup to move forward and then we presented to the delegation and we had a unanimous vote of the delegation to move forward with the next step of the process so if there's a question is whether or not we have looked at ways to reducing the cost we're not building the Taj Mahal we're building what our county needs our seniors, according to the codes that are presently in place.

1700
03:36:52,500 --> 03:37:00,500
And I would further add that when I moved into Grantham, we built a brand-new house.

1701
03:37:00,500 --> 03:37:32,500
I figured we were set, that we were good for life life that was 20 years ago and the renovations are well underway so I would say to counties that have already done a renovation this is not a short-term fund this fund will be there when those renovations get old and need to be redone or when a building needs to be rebuilt.

1702
03:37:32,500 --> 03:37:41,500
So this will benefit every county in the state at some point or another, some sooner than others.

1703
03:37:41,500 --> 03:37:43,500
And I'll stop there.

1704
03:37:43,500 --> 03:37:45,500
I've got a question.

1705
03:37:45,500 --> 03:37:50,500
How many beds are we talking about for long-term care?

1706
03:37:50,500 --> 03:37:54,500
Is there also rehab beds as well involved?

1707
03:37:54,500 --> 03:37:56,500
There are both.

1708
03:37:56,500 --> 03:38:04,000
I want to say 156 beds, and some of those beds are dedicated to rehab.

1709
03:38:04,000 --> 03:38:06,000
Okay.

1710
03:38:06,000 --> 03:38:09,500
I'll ask the folks from the time.

1711
03:38:09,500 --> 03:38:11,500
I'll ask.

1712
03:38:11,500 --> 03:38:13,500
Okay.

1713
03:38:13,500 --> 03:38:16,000
They've got the numbers pinned.

1714
03:38:16,000 --> 03:38:18,000
Thank you.

1715
03:38:18,000 --> 03:38:20,000
Any questions?

1716
03:38:20,000 --> 03:38:22,000
Okay.

1717
03:38:22,000 --> 03:38:25,500
I'll ask the folks from the county.

1718
03:38:25,500 --> 03:38:27,500
I'll ask.

1719
03:38:27,500 --> 03:38:29,500
Okay.

1720
03:38:29,500 --> 03:38:32,000
They've got the numbers pinned.

1721
03:38:32,000 --> 03:38:34,000
Thank you.

1722
03:38:34,000 --> 03:38:36,000
Any questions?

1723
03:38:36,000 --> 03:38:38,000
Okay.

1724
03:38:38,000 --> 03:38:40,000
Thank you.

1725
03:38:40,000 --> 03:38:42,000
Thank you.

1726
03:38:42,000 --> 03:38:44,000
All right.

1727
03:38:44,000 --> 03:38:47,500
We have three representatives from Sullivan County.

1728
03:38:47,500 --> 03:38:49,500
We have Mary Bork.

1729
03:38:49,500 --> 03:38:51,500
Good afternoon, Mr.

1730
03:38:51,500 --> 03:38:55,000
Chair and distinguished members of the committee.

1731
03:38:55,000 --> 03:40:13,500
My name name is Mary Burke I'm the director of facilities and operations for Sullivan County and have spent more than 25 years of my professional career in managing facilities and capital improvement projects thank you for the opportunity to appear before you in support of HB 1525 establishing a capital reserve fund to support county-run nursing homes across the state the design construction and renovation of nursing homes is a highly complex and regulated process enforced at the state level by dhhs and at the federal level level by the centers for medicare and medicaid services construction and renovation projects require compliance with current facility Guid guidelines Institute or FGI as we spoke about already with the FGI being the minimum standard for health care facilities to meet it serves as the building code for health care spaces within our nursing homes beyond the FGI nursing homes must also comply with current building codes and regulations.

1732
03:40:13,500 --> 03:40:26,500
When I joined Sullivan County in 2017, the county had recently completed a feasibility study to address the outdated building and infrastructure of its nursing home.

1733
03:40:26,500 --> 03:45:03,000
As the initial estimates for the project in 2016 were overwhelming, the project moved forward slowly in an effort to evaluate different options with a full design effort for a renovation and addition completed in 2020 from the initial study in 2016 until the final design in 2020 the state of New Hampshire had adopted two new iterations of the FGI in 2000 2014 version and 2018 version as well as a new iteration of the International Building Code or IBC with each new version requirements became more complex and restrictive as FGI moved towards resident centered care with more home-like environments which is an approach very different to the hospital style layouts of nursing home used at the time of construction of many nursing homes in New Hampshire including ours in Sullivan County this layout could not be accommodated within the footburner of our current building compliance that was achievable with a small addition when the project was first initiated in 2016 by 2020 needed a much larger addition at an estimated cost of additional eight million dollars to our project in addition we estimate that in the fall of 2019 when New Hampshire adopted the 2018 IBC and the 2018 FDI our project increased by more than three and a half million for these one-time code changes the new FGI increased the room size again and added even larger rooms to accommodate persons of size the changes increase the average resident room in 2019 by approximately 10% with the next iteration of FGI due to be published in 2022 we can only expect that these codes to become more rigorous when we review the interim guidance published in March of 2021 by FGI in response to the COVID-19 pandemic we can foresee even larger resident rooms an increased number of bathrooms as the code transitions to private rooms because of of funding for the proposed renovation Sullivan County has been in a standstill since 2020 during that time construction costs have continued to rise and we anticipate this delay to have cost Sullivan County nearly six million dollars increased construction costs by the time we hope to rebuild this project later this year the progression of restoring and modernizing the Sullivan County nursing home has ultimately been slowed by the unaffordability of the project to the county the impacts that I have described add up over to 17 million dollars making what would have been a 33 million dollar project in 2016 to what will likely be more than a 50 million dollar project now the cost of delay on such an important project makes it even more unattainable as the next round of code of code changes looms ahead of us New Hampshire counties are charged with caring for some of the most vulnerable citizens in our state it's not only a Sullivan County issue other counties will also be facing needed capital restoration to their aging facilities that no longer provide the safest environment for residents nor allow staff to provide resident-centered care that results in more positive outcomes for our seniors the covid19 pandemic has highlighted seriously serious inadequacies of current buildings and systems where lack of ventilation, shared bathrooms, cramped living spaces for residents, and limited workspace for staff ultimately contribute to the spread of the virus.

1734
03:45:03,000 --> 03:47:24,500
While we wait for this project to move forward, we have operated and maintained our facilities in a very reactive mode as systems continue to deteriorate we've had significant failures including sanitary waste piping leaking sewage into occupied office areas flooding of resident rooms with 180 degree water from the heating system leaking steam and water piping failures that flood stairwells with today's supply chain issues we have great concern that major components with our building systems will fail and replacements won't be readily available as we operate in this reactive environment a nursing home capital reserve fund like that for new hampshire school system will ensure the county-run nursing homes can pursue renovation and construction projects in a timely manner and prevent delay of needed improvements to facilities and instruct infrastructure by preventing such delays and deferments this bill supports compliance with the adopted regulations by the state of New Hampshire and supports the mission of New Hampshire counties to provide our elderly residents often with dementia Disabling conditions and no place else to go a safe and comfortable environment Thank you very much for your consideration and I encourage the committee to support HB 1525 I will just make a comment to a question I heard earlier In regards to the bill there is a cap that is proposed on the bill for funding an individual project based on the percentage of the beds in the county so for example in the county in Sullivan County we have 57 percent of the beds in the entire county for nursing homes and so our eligibility for a disbursement out of this fund would be capped at 57% of the total project cost.

1735
03:47:24,500 --> 03:47:26,500
Any questions?

1736
03:47:26,500 --> 03:47:28,500
I see none.

1737
03:47:28,500 --> 03:47:31,500
Representative Almey, you're thinking about it?

1738
03:47:31,500 --> 03:47:33,500
Representative Almey.

1739
03:47:33,500 --> 03:47:35,500
Yes.

1740
03:47:35,500 --> 03:47:43,500
I'm wondering how you decided that that was the significant way to put a cap in.

1741
03:47:43,500 --> 03:48:23,500
Because a county that had, for other reasons, a fairly large number of commercial beds would doom its nursing home, which could be full and decaying, as someone pointed out could to not being able to get money from the fund I would have to defer that to the sponsors of the committee I was only offering that fact as in response to a question that I heard go unanswered earlier representative are do you want to answer that question?

1742
03:48:23,500 --> 03:48:27,500
Do you have an answer to that question?

1743
03:48:27,500 --> 03:48:29,500
Okay, Mr.

1744
03:48:29,500 --> 03:48:31,500
Purdy, you're next.

1745
03:48:31,500 --> 03:48:33,500
He's next.

1746
03:48:33,500 --> 03:48:35,500
Okay, thank you.

1747
03:48:35,500 --> 03:48:37,500
Oh, where's that?

1748
03:48:37,500 --> 03:48:39,500
I'm sorry.

1749
03:48:39,500 --> 03:48:41,500
Sounds like Mr.

1750
03:48:41,500 --> 03:48:45,000
Purdy would have an answer to this.

1751
03:48:45,000 --> 03:48:50,000
It doesn't say on the card what his position is.

1752
03:48:50,000 --> 03:48:53,500
That would be best answered by Mr.

1753
03:48:53,500 --> 03:49:02,000
Purdy, and I'm willing to defer my any remaining time that I have for him to speak.

1754
03:49:02,000 --> 03:49:04,000
Okay.

1755
03:49:04,000 --> 03:49:06,000
Thank you very much.

1756
03:49:06,000 --> 03:49:08,000
Mr.

1757
03:49:08,000 --> 03:49:10,000
Purdy, you're very popular.

1758
03:49:10,000 --> 03:49:13,000
I want to hear from you.

1759
03:49:13,000 --> 03:49:15,000
Good afternoon Mr.

1760
03:49:15,000 --> 03:49:17,000
Chair.

1761
03:49:17,000 --> 03:49:19,000
I'm Ted Purdy.

1762
03:49:19,000 --> 03:50:01,500
I'm the nursing administrator for Southern accounting health care one question I come up we are our 156 bed facility we're duly certified meaning we can accept Medicare and Medicaid throughout the building currently we have our skilled unit as you allude to is a 20 bed unit our renovations are looking at a 16 bed definitive unit to be able to provide skilled services to the community if I may county nursing homes represent 25% of the licensed beds in New Hampshire Thank you.

1763
03:50:01,500 --> 03:50:32,500
to the community if I may county nursing homes represent 25% of the licensed beds in New Hampshire and provide a significant resource to our elderly citizens in care for a greater percentage of Medicaid patients than private facilities the requirements of participation promulgated by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid services determine the level and quality of services to licensed facilities.

1764
03:50:32,500 --> 03:50:41,500
Current requirements and updated life safety and construction codes positively impact the environment of care for our elderly.

1765
03:50:41,500 --> 03:52:45,000
The major contributions are to infection control, resident safety, and resident dignity and home-like environment the key components minimizing the spread of infectious diseases including COVID-19 are social distancing and appropriate ventilation the current requirements codify those components spacing between resident beds and furniture along with distances for maneuvering wheelchairs and equipment strengthen the safety of residents and staff when care is provided the requirement to have a bathroom in each of the resident rooms provides for more dignity and personal care is provided along with an enhanced home-like environment county nursing homes are supported by county taxpayers to various degrees primarily due to the high percentage of Medicaid and that the Medicaid does not cover all of our cost smaller counties such as southern co-host Grafton and Cheshire operated a greater percentage of total nursing home beds and thus impact the county tax rate to a larger extent than counties with larger populations for instance as alluded to in Sullivan County we represent 56% of our total beds within the county Coas County with their two facilities represent 47% of beds Grafton County represents 32% Cheshire County represents 29% so it so happens to be that the smaller facilities the smaller counties have a larger impact on the number of beds and also any cost relating to the nursing facility there's not covered by Medicaid Medicare and reimbursement has a larger extent to impact on the taxpayers that I ask for your support of HB 1525.

1766
03:52:45,000 --> 03:52:47,500
Who wants to go first?

1767
03:52:47,500 --> 03:52:50,000
Representative Almy or Representative Ames?

1768
03:52:50,000 --> 03:52:52,000
You have a question.

1769
03:52:52,000 --> 03:52:54,000
Representative?

1770
03:52:54,000 --> 03:52:57,500
Representative Almy, you want to go first?

1771
03:52:57,500 --> 03:52:59,500
Oh, Representative Ames.

1772
03:52:59,500 --> 03:53:01,500
You don't have one.

1773
03:53:01,500 --> 03:53:03,500
Okay, thank you.

1774
03:53:03,500 --> 03:53:05,500
Okay, Representative Gamalo.

1775
03:53:05,500 --> 03:53:07,500
Thank you.

1776
03:53:07,500 --> 03:53:16,000
So that paragraph that I referenced earlier on page 1, line 28, about the long-term care beds.

1777
03:53:16,000 --> 03:53:31,500
So you're talking other facilities in the county that are not county-run and the amount of beds they have and has a percentage of what your facility has is 56 percent.

1778
03:53:31,500 --> 03:53:33,500
Correct.

1779
03:53:33,500 --> 03:53:40,000
So in Cheshire, we have several Genesis facilities, even in Winchester and other.

1780
03:53:40,000 --> 03:53:42,000
Okay.

1781
03:53:42,000 --> 03:53:44,000
Now I understand.

1782
03:53:44,000 --> 03:53:46,000
Thank you.

1783
03:53:46,000 --> 03:53:48,000
Thank you.

1784
03:53:48,000 --> 03:53:51,500
I have a question about the 156.

1785
03:53:51,500 --> 03:53:54,000
You currently have 156 beds.

1786
03:53:54,000 --> 03:54:01,000
Is the project, when the project's done, you're still going to have 156 beds?

1787
03:54:01,000 --> 03:54:03,000
Yes.

1788
03:54:03,000 --> 03:54:05,000
Okay.

1789
03:54:05,000 --> 03:54:08,500
There's no change in the bed number.

1790
03:54:08,500 --> 03:54:10,500
No.

1791
03:54:10,500 --> 03:54:12,500
Thank you.

1792
03:54:12,500 --> 03:54:14,500
How about the mix?

1793
03:54:14,500 --> 03:54:22,500
The mix, we traditionally run roughly 85% Medicaid, another 10% private, and the rest Medicare skilled.

1794
03:54:22,500 --> 03:54:27,500
I meant a mix of skilled versus nursing home beds.

1795
03:54:27,500 --> 03:54:29,500
Right.

1796
03:54:29,500 --> 03:54:33,500
And so that's what I was alluding to.

1797
03:54:33,500 --> 03:54:35,500
We traditionally run about...

1798
03:54:35,500 --> 03:54:40,500
Oh, when you say Medicare, that would be the skill.

1799
03:54:40,500 --> 03:54:42,500
Right, Medicare part A.

1800
03:54:42,500 --> 03:54:46,500
So usually around 10% to 12% Medicare priority.

1801
03:54:46,500 --> 03:54:48,500
Okay.

1802
03:54:48,500 --> 03:54:50,500
Thank you.

1803
03:54:50,500 --> 03:54:52,500
Okay, Rips.

1804
03:54:52,500 --> 03:54:54,500
Thank you, sir.

1805
03:54:54,500 --> 03:55:01,500
So of the 156 bed capacity that you currently have, is that fully occupied?

1806
03:55:01,500 --> 03:55:04,500
Is it used at that level?

1807
03:55:04,500 --> 03:55:12,000
Currently, we've been running on average over the last 10 years about 135, 136 patients.

1808
03:55:12,000 --> 03:55:14,000
Uh-huh.

1809
03:55:14,000 --> 03:55:25,000
As in all facilities throughout New Hampshire due to COVID and various other aspects, count statewide occupancy is around 70 to 75%.

1810
03:55:25,000 --> 03:55:29,000
Yeah, I think that's true in Cheshire County.

1811
03:55:29,000 --> 03:55:33,000
Yeah, we've been running currently, we're at 125.

1812
03:55:33,000 --> 03:55:35,000
Thank you.

1813
03:55:35,000 --> 03:55:37,500
All right, any other questions?

1814
03:55:37,500 --> 03:55:39,500
Mr.

1815
03:55:39,500 --> 03:55:41,500
Velmi?

1816
03:55:41,500 --> 03:55:46,500
Yes, I'm still trying to understand the rationale for your...

1817
03:55:46,500 --> 03:56:00,500
Sorry, I'm still trying to understand the rationale for the bills using of the percentage of nursing home beds in the county that are county nursing home beds.

1818
03:56:00,500 --> 03:56:04,500
Because it depends a lot on the geography.

1819
03:56:04,500 --> 03:56:08,500
In COAS, people just can't get very well.

1820
03:56:08,500 --> 03:56:14,000
That's why they have two nursing homes, which are killing them.

1821
03:56:14,000 --> 03:56:17,000
But they can't get to places.

1822
03:56:17,000 --> 03:56:25,000
And if they live closer to a commercial nursing home, they're going to go to it.

1823
03:56:25,000 --> 03:56:28,500
The same thing happens in my county.

1824
03:56:28,500 --> 03:56:52,500
I'm continually trying to get people to go to our really good Alzheimer's unit up north but it's an hour up north and the family isn't going to be able to see them very often so they go to Genesis or a couple of other smaller alternatives around.

1825
03:56:52,500 --> 03:56:54,500
Is there a question?

1826
03:56:54,500 --> 03:56:58,000
The question is, what rationale is there?

1827
03:56:58,000 --> 03:57:01,000
And that's what I started with.

1828
03:57:01,000 --> 03:57:54,000
So I believe certainly it's part of the sponsors desires to at least recognize the aspect of say Sullivan County in particular co-ops is another one and even Grafton is that is to recognize that our the percentage of total beds is is higher than than it is other statewide so it's a mechanism at least to consider you know what percentage of total beds are provided by Sullivan County and other nursing facilities to help determine would just like nice and we're not supposed to say anything now okay all right any other questions represent packing Phillips thank you thank you mr partyardier, I believe.

1829
03:57:54,000 --> 03:58:04,000
I just had a question about the same section that you were just taking a look at of the law.

1830
03:58:04,000 --> 03:58:43,000
When it speaks about allocation, the funding allocation for the proportion of beds, the next line says that priorities should be granted to nursing homes with a larger percent of long-term care beds in their facility when compared to other county nursing homes and i guess i just don't understand um the prioritization that's set up here do you have any kind of uh narrative that you can help shed some light about what that priority should be?

1831
03:58:43,000 --> 03:59:01,500
I think that there again, the details certainly, we're certainly comfortable with any type of kind of consideration as to how that's done or leave it to Department of Health and Human Services to how it's done.

1832
03:59:01,500 --> 04:00:18,500
What we been trying to certainly say into is to indicate that because that the nursing facilities in the smaller counties Sullivan being one has a higher percentage of total beds within the county it impacts and the populations are lower within the counties it impacts the taxpayers to a greater extent when when additional support is needed for the nursing well I think just maybe some clarification and the language might be needed in this section to really get that point across um clearly the folks at ols uh you know are the experts but um i it is um not clear to me in the in this two line section that um you know what your intent or the group's intent is coming across with the language presented so um it might be a little area of refining that's needed thank you okay thank you representative amos i think you Thank you.

1833
04:00:18,500 --> 04:00:20,500
Okay, thank you.

1834
04:00:20,500 --> 04:00:24,500
Representative Ames, I think you had one more.

1835
04:00:24,500 --> 04:00:30,500
Yeah, my question was pointed to the same part of this bill.

1836
04:00:30,500 --> 04:00:33,000
And it's really both sentences.

1837
04:00:33,000 --> 04:00:35,500
The first is the allocation.

1838
04:00:35,500 --> 04:00:40,500
Funds shall be allocated as a percentage of the portion.

1839
04:00:40,500 --> 04:00:43,000
I don't really understand that.

1840
04:00:43,000 --> 04:00:49,500
And then there's the second sentence that you were just discussing, the prioritization.

1841
04:00:49,500 --> 04:00:55,000
I think maybe an example to show what the intent is.

1842
04:00:55,000 --> 04:01:13,000
If there were indeed $25 million available and more than one project from more than one county with different percentages in the terms described here, what would be the allocation and how would it be prioritized?

1843
04:01:13,000 --> 04:01:16,000
I don't have that specific story.

1844
04:01:16,000 --> 04:01:32,500
I know you don't, but I'm saying that feedback to us clarifying the intent might lead to some wording changes that would enable all of us to understand it in the same way.

1845
04:01:32,500 --> 04:01:45,000
Representative Ames, we do have a representative from HHS here who hasn't submitted a PIN but will answer questions at the end if we need.

1846
04:01:45,000 --> 04:01:50,500
Although she said to me she's not really a fiscal person.

1847
04:01:50,500 --> 04:01:57,000
But at least she could bring that question back to HHS for us.

1848
04:01:57,000 --> 04:01:59,000
All right.

1849
04:01:59,000 --> 04:02:01,000
Thank you.

1850
04:02:01,000 --> 04:02:03,000
Thank you.

1851
04:02:03,000 --> 04:02:13,000
We have one more card, one more gentlemen, I know we're over time, so I will try to be succinct.

1852
04:02:13,000 --> 04:02:15,000
We appreciate that.

1853
04:02:15,000 --> 04:02:17,500
My name is Derek Furland.

1854
04:02:17,500 --> 04:02:21,000
I'm the county manager for Sullivan County.

1855
04:02:21,000 --> 04:02:57,000
So thank you very much for the time to hear our testimony today I'll focus on the costs of long-term care there are two components to this cost is the annual operating cost and then the capital cost that we have to incur for major projects so it's important to note there's a representative that mentioned earlier that Hillsborough County has a nursing home reserve fund with over $30 million in it.

1856
04:02:57,000 --> 04:03:07,000
Hillsborough County is the only county of the 10 that operates at an annual surplus from their nursing home operations.

1857
04:03:07,000 --> 04:03:20,000
Most counties lose anywhere from one and a half to two and a half million dollars a year, as I'm sure you all probably know already.

1858
04:03:20,000 --> 04:03:47,500
So that's already a pretty significant investment from each of the county's taxpayers just to maintain the operation and the reason why counties tend to lose money is because the majority of our resident population is supported through the Medicaid program and as we know Medicaid reimbursements do not adequately cover the cost of care.

1859
04:03:47,500 --> 04:04:00,000
So in addition to this annual deficit, we now face significant capital costs, which has been articulated as largely being driven by these federal regulations.

1860
04:04:00,000 --> 04:04:10,500
Also, the scarcity of labor and demand for materials in more recent years is another significant factor that's increasing these costs.

1861
04:04:10,500 --> 04:04:26,500
The projected impact to just Sullivan County if we were to bond for this 50 plus million dollar project would be roughly a 25 percent increase to our current county tax rate.

1862
04:04:26,500 --> 04:04:46,000
That would be a pretty big pill to swallow which in fact is the reason why for the past couple of years we've been at basically an impasse because it's just a too big of a pill to swallow.

1863
04:04:46,000 --> 04:04:53,000
I think this approach is sensible in terms of what the bill is proposing.

1864
04:04:53,000 --> 04:04:55,000
It is Thank you.

1865
04:04:55,000 --> 04:05:06,000
past couple of years we've been on a basically an impasse because it's just a too big of a pill to swallow.

1866
04:05:06,000 --> 04:05:13,000
I think this approach is sensible in terms of what the bill is proposing.

1867
04:05:13,000 --> 04:05:26,000
It is patterned after the state and county or the state collaboration that already exists with the the public education construction fund as we mentioned before.

1868
04:05:26,000 --> 04:05:44,500
I think a key difference though is that there are only 11 county nursing homes in the state and I think that the the reality would be that the withdrawals from this fund would be very infrequent.

1869
04:05:44,500 --> 04:05:52,500
We mentioned that a few of the counties have actually done major renovations in recent years.

1870
04:05:52,500 --> 04:06:02,500
And so it's likely another 30 or 40 years, in some cases, before a major project would be required again.

1871
04:06:02,500 --> 04:06:41,500
Another question that was asked before was how much does Sullivan County have in the bank right now we do have a capital reserve fund with about five million dollars in it we have been steadily trying to set aside money for this for this requirement we also have about seven million dollars remaining of our just over eight million that we received in ARPA funding so about 12 million is what is what we can kick in.

1872
04:06:41,500 --> 04:06:53,500
Again, we don't know what the next cost estimate will be for the project, but it will be most certainly north of $50 million.

1873
04:06:53,500 --> 04:07:00,500
So there will be a pretty sizable chunk left for our taxpayers to absorb.

1874
04:07:00,500 --> 04:07:05,000
I think that is all I wanted to say.

1875
04:07:05,000 --> 04:07:12,500
I can be mindful of the time, but I'm happy to answer any other questions.

1876
04:07:12,500 --> 04:07:14,500
Thank you.

1877
04:07:14,500 --> 04:07:17,000
Thank you for your testimony.

1878
04:07:17,000 --> 04:07:22,000
What was that, a 30-year bond you were looking at?

1879
04:07:22,000 --> 04:07:27,000
A 30-year, yes, a 29-year bond through the bond bank.

1880
04:07:27,000 --> 04:08:26,500
We ran different scenarios and that's okay representative Ames going forward with this on your own would lead to a 25% increase in the tax rate what is the tax rate now in the county on average is about three dollars per thousand but our tax the tax I should have said not tax rate the total taxes and we are our county tax bill is about 14 million dollars right now so a bond would be anywhere from three to four million depending on the term and the rate on average that's correct and one other point to just take other stab at trying to clarify the proportional issue based on the number of beds for the county.

1881
04:08:26,500 --> 04:08:33,000
We mentioned 56% of the beds in Sullivan County are at our facility.

1882
04:08:33,000 --> 04:08:41,000
And I think what we've observed is that the poorer counties are the more rural counties.

1883
04:08:41,000 --> 04:08:48,500
And those counties tend to have the higher percentage of beds at their county facility.

1884
04:08:48,500 --> 04:08:52,000
I think the reason is fairly evident.

1885
04:08:52,000 --> 04:08:59,500
It's that there's not as much private sector involvement in long-term care in those counties.

1886
04:08:59,500 --> 04:09:34,000
That's generally more of a you know the larger cities are the ones that enjoy greater involvement from the private sector so the burden there's a greater responsibility maybe not burdens probably not the right word but there's a greater responsibility for those poorer and more rural counties to provide this function for our seniors, but because they're the poorer counties, they have a harder time meeting this requirement.

1887
04:09:34,000 --> 04:09:48,000
So it's kind of an inverse relationship between the demand for these beds in the counties and the ability of those counties to pay for this mission set.

1888
04:09:48,000 --> 04:10:01,500
So I do think perhaps some additional discussions on putting a cap beyond the percentage that we've articulated in this draft would certainly be something worth discussing.

1889
04:10:01,500 --> 04:10:12,500
But the fact remains that it's a pretty big bill, and we're talking about counties with limited means to pay for this.

1890
04:10:12,500 --> 04:10:19,500
So can this project, contemplating the $50 million project, be broken into logical pieces?

1891
04:10:19,500 --> 04:10:22,500
Well, we have a phasing strategy.

1892
04:10:22,500 --> 04:10:24,500
That's what I meant.

1893
04:10:24,500 --> 04:10:35,000
Yes, it's being phased, but it can't be phased in distinct, separate projects that could be funded, say, five years apart.

1894
04:10:35,000 --> 04:10:47,000
I mean, all told, it's going to be about a three-year project with the various dominoes of trying to, you know, construct a piece.

1895
04:10:47,000 --> 04:10:52,500
You've got to keep the building going at the same time.

1896
04:10:52,500 --> 04:10:54,500
Right.

1897
04:10:54,500 --> 04:11:00,000
If we were building new, it would be a different animal.

1898
04:11:00,000 --> 04:11:18,500
But because we're trying to renovate and add on to it, we have to try to manage that appropriately so that we don't lose census during construction, which would create another fiscal impact during the construction period.

1899
04:11:18,500 --> 04:11:20,500
Any other questions?

1900
04:11:20,500 --> 04:11:22,500
Representative Janagian.

1901
04:11:22,500 --> 04:11:24,500
Thank you, Mr.

1902
04:11:24,500 --> 04:11:26,500
Chairman.

1903
04:11:26,500 --> 04:11:28,500
Just a quick question.

1904
04:11:28,500 --> 04:11:31,500
Thank you for taking my question.

1905
04:11:31,500 --> 04:11:37,000
You said you had about $7 million in ARPA money now.

1906
04:11:37,000 --> 04:11:44,000
Can you still apply for more, or are you already limited to that amount?

1907
04:11:44,000 --> 04:11:49,000
Based on your application, did you apply for $50 million?

1908
04:11:49,000 --> 04:11:52,000
I mean, how does that work?

1909
04:11:52,000 --> 04:11:55,000
How much can you apply for?

1910
04:11:55,000 --> 04:11:57,000
Thanks for your question.

1911
04:11:57,000 --> 04:12:01,000
The ARPA funding was just a flat number.

1912
04:12:01,000 --> 04:12:03,500
It was based on population.

1913
04:12:03,500 --> 04:12:07,500
So our allocation was just under $8.4 million.

1914
04:12:07,500 --> 04:12:17,500
We allocated about $1.4 million for some premium pay for our first responders, nursing staff, and our county attorney staff.

1915
04:12:17,500 --> 04:12:22,500
So 7 million is about what we'll have left over.

1916
04:12:22,500 --> 04:12:47,500
We have applied, and I think Chairman Cloutier mentioned this, through Senator Shaheen's office for a congressionally directed spending request, which my understanding was it was approved, but because the federal budget hasn't been passed yet, we have no word as to whether that will provide any additional federal funding.

1917
04:12:47,500 --> 04:12:50,500
That was a $2 million request.

1918
04:12:50,500 --> 04:13:02,000
So even if it is approved, it's really not going to be the answer to all of our prayers, but it certainly helps.

1919
04:13:02,000 --> 04:13:14,500
In terms of additional spending through the pending infrastructure bills, we don't foresee anything specific to nursing homes or long-term care facilities in those bills.

1920
04:13:14,500 --> 04:13:20,500
The focus is on a lot of other things, but not this.

1921
04:13:20,500 --> 04:13:35,500
So we've certainly kept our eyes out for any other opportunities through the federal government, but our own ARPA allocation is really all we've been told to expect to receive.

1922
04:13:35,500 --> 04:13:48,500
And again, small population, 44,000 people equated to about an $8 million total ARPA allocation, which is pretty small compared to what some other counties got.

1923
04:13:48,500 --> 04:14:00,500
So that 88 million allocation, you said based on population, but it wasn't necessarily a request directly for the nursing home build or rebuild.

1924
04:14:00,500 --> 04:14:07,500
No, the eligible uses for ARPA funding were specified by the Department of Treasury.

1925
04:14:07,500 --> 04:14:15,000
So that's what we're – we've kept most of it set aside for that purpose.

1926
04:14:15,000 --> 04:14:17,000
So follow-up.

1927
04:14:17,000 --> 04:14:23,000
So could you make a request for ARPA funding directly for renovations?

1928
04:14:23,000 --> 04:14:25,000
We could.

1929
04:14:25,000 --> 04:14:35,500
I don't know to whom that request would be directed because to my understanding there's no additional pot of ARPA funding.

1930
04:14:35,500 --> 04:14:43,500
Local governments got what they got, and so there was a formula that derived that amount.

1931
04:14:43,500 --> 04:14:48,500
And my understanding is there's no more to be had.

1932
04:14:48,500 --> 04:14:59,000
If there was, I probably would have heard about it by now, but I'll certainly be happy to continue exploring options.

1933
04:14:59,000 --> 04:15:01,000
Thank you.

1934
04:15:01,000 --> 04:15:09,500
So as a follow-up to that, so you've already submitted your plan for your upper money, correct?

1935
04:15:09,500 --> 04:15:12,500
Counties were fewer than, oh, gosh.

1936
04:15:12,500 --> 04:15:15,000
There was a population threshold.

1937
04:15:15,000 --> 04:15:17,500
We were below it, obviously.

1938
04:15:17,500 --> 04:15:21,000
We didn't have to submit a plan.

1939
04:15:21,000 --> 04:15:24,500
We didn't have to submit a plan.

1940
04:15:24,500 --> 04:15:31,000
We just have to follow the guidelines that were obligated by the Treasury.

1941
04:15:31,000 --> 04:15:33,000
Okay, thank you.

1942
04:15:33,000 --> 04:15:35,000
We're rocking in.

1943
04:15:35,000 --> 04:15:38,000
We had to submit a plan.

1944
04:15:38,000 --> 04:15:40,000
That's why.

1945
04:15:40,000 --> 04:15:42,000
Thanks.

1946
04:15:42,000 --> 04:15:44,500
All right, any other questions?

1947
04:15:44,500 --> 04:15:47,500
All right, thank you very much.

1948
04:15:47,500 --> 04:15:49,500
Thank you.

1949
04:15:49,500 --> 04:15:51,500
Miss Tom?

1950
04:15:51,500 --> 04:15:53,500
Tom?

1951
04:15:53,500 --> 04:15:55,500
Yes.

1952
04:15:55,500 --> 04:16:00,500
You can fill out a pink card when we're done.

1953
04:16:00,500 --> 04:16:02,500
Sure.

1954
04:16:02,500 --> 04:16:05,500
But if we have any, HHS.

1955
04:16:05,500 --> 04:16:07,500
Yes, good afternoon.

1956
04:16:07,500 --> 04:16:10,000
My name is Kelly Tom.

1957
04:16:10,000 --> 04:16:13,000
I'm the department representative here today.

1958
04:16:13,000 --> 04:16:15,000
I am an attorney.

1959
04:16:15,000 --> 04:16:19,000
I am with the Bureau of General Counsel.

1960
04:16:19,000 --> 04:16:23,500
Specifically, I represent the Bureau of Licensing and Certifications.

1961
04:16:23,500 --> 04:16:27,500
So I am the Department Representative here today.

1962
04:16:27,500 --> 04:16:33,000
I'm happy to take back any questions that you do have.

1963
04:16:33,000 --> 04:16:46,500
Unfortunately, I am not the accountant in the Department, so I have limited expertise to share with you in regards to the funds within this proposed bill.

1964
04:16:46,500 --> 04:16:48,500
Okay.

1965
04:16:48,500 --> 04:16:54,000
I don't think we need to come up with questions today.

1966
04:16:54,000 --> 04:17:05,000
I think we can sleep on this, and then we can submit the questions to you to forward to the correct person.

1967
04:17:05,000 --> 04:17:10,000
Yes, we have my contact information, and I can certainly...

1968
04:17:10,000 --> 04:17:20,500
And then, especially when we get to work session on this, when we talk this through, we may have some questions.

1969
04:17:20,500 --> 04:17:22,500
Excellent.

1970
04:17:22,500 --> 04:17:24,500
Thank you so much.

1971
04:17:24,500 --> 04:17:26,500
Okay.

1972
04:17:26,500 --> 04:17:28,500
Anybody have questions, though?

1973
04:17:28,500 --> 04:17:30,500
I don't want to...

1974
04:17:30,500 --> 04:17:32,500
Okay.

1975
04:17:32,500 --> 04:17:34,500
None.

1976
04:17:34,500 --> 04:17:36,500
Thank you very much.

1977
04:17:36,500 --> 04:17:38,500
Sure.

1978
04:17:38,500 --> 04:17:40,500
Okay.

1979
04:17:40,500 --> 04:17:46,000
Can we, Representative Janai Ging, see if any names on the...

1980
04:17:46,000 --> 04:17:49,000
Oh, first, anybody else want to.

1981
04:17:49,000 --> 04:17:51,000
Okay.

1982
04:17:51,000 --> 04:17:53,000
None.

1983
04:17:53,000 --> 04:17:55,000
Thank you very much.

1984
04:17:55,000 --> 04:17:57,000
Okay.

1985
04:17:57,000 --> 04:18:02,000
Can we, Representative Janicki, see if any names on the...

1986
04:18:02,000 --> 04:18:07,000
Oh, first, anybody else want to testify on this bill?

1987
04:18:07,000 --> 04:18:09,000
No?

1988
04:18:09,000 --> 04:18:16,000
And we want to read the blue sheet if there's any names on there?

1989
04:18:16,000 --> 04:18:18,000
Yes.

1990
04:18:18,000 --> 04:18:20,000
No?

1991
04:18:20,000 --> 04:18:24,000
Oh, yes, it is because of the money.

1992
04:18:24,000 --> 04:18:27,000
Yes, yes, yes, yes, it is.

1993
04:18:27,000 --> 04:18:29,000
Representative Major knows.

1994
04:18:29,000 --> 04:18:32,500
I think in two or three weeks.

1995
04:18:32,500 --> 04:18:34,500
I think early February.

1996
04:18:34,500 --> 04:18:36,500
Right.

1997
04:18:36,500 --> 04:18:38,500
Yep.

1998
04:18:38,500 --> 04:18:41,000
How many names are there?

1999
04:18:41,000 --> 04:18:44,000
There's seven, four, and one against.

2000
04:18:44,000 --> 04:18:47,000
Just read the names real quick.

2001
04:18:47,000 --> 04:18:49,000
Okay.

2002
04:18:49,000 --> 04:19:03,000
So four, Judy Aaron, Derek Furland, Mary Bork, Ted Purdy, Kate Horgan, Representative Gary, sorry, I can't read the last name, and Representative Walt Stapleton against Greg Moore.

2003
04:19:03,000 --> 04:19:05,000
Okay.

2004
04:19:05,000 --> 04:19:07,000
All right.

2005
04:19:07,000 --> 04:19:09,000
Thank you.

2006
04:19:09,000 --> 04:19:11,000
No further testimony.

2007
04:19:11,000 --> 04:19:16,000
I'm going to close the hearing on House Bill 1525.

2008
04:19:16,000 --> 04:19:19,000
Thank you all for being here.

2009
04:19:19,000 --> 04:19:21,000
Representative Almey.

2010
04:19:21,000 --> 04:19:27,500
I'm going to ask people that you don't sign it when you're testifying.

2011
04:19:27,500 --> 04:19:29,500
Yeah.

2012
04:19:29,500 --> 04:19:34,000
I have to leave at like five minutes too.

2013
04:19:34,000 --> 04:19:39,000
So I have to have a meeting with the governor.

2014
04:19:39,000 --> 04:19:41,000
So I can't.

2015
04:19:41,000 --> 04:19:44,000
So would you mind taking over?

2016
04:19:44,000 --> 04:19:46,000
When the time comes.

2017
04:19:46,000 --> 04:19:48,000
When the time comes.

2018
04:19:48,000 --> 04:19:50,000
Okay.

2019
04:19:50,000 --> 04:19:52,000
And the prime sponsor.

2020
04:19:52,000 --> 04:19:54,000
Okay.

2021
04:19:54,000 --> 04:20:00,000
I'm going to call the hearing on House Bill 1565 to order.

2022
04:20:00,000 --> 04:20:03,000
The prime sponsor Thank you, committee.

2023
04:20:03,000 --> 04:20:05,000
Thank you, committee.

2024
04:20:05,000 --> 04:20:11,000
Thank you, chairman and committee members for hearing this bill again today.

2025
04:20:11,000 --> 04:20:15,000
It is a doubleheader for me, I guess.

2026
04:20:15,000 --> 04:20:53,000
So today I present this bill to you along with an amendment to it because we wanted to clear up some language and I sent the amendment to you beforehand so you have that in front of you as well as the original bill but let me let me go through some things here in talking about this opioid abatement trust fund this fund for those of you who don't know, was established in March 2020.

2027
04:20:53,000 --> 04:20:56,500
Representative, you said there was an amendment?

2028
04:20:56,500 --> 04:21:01,000
Yeah, I sent it via email to the committee.

2029
04:21:01,000 --> 04:21:04,500
We do have a copy of it.

2030
04:21:04,500 --> 04:21:06,500
Oh, I'm sorry.

2031
04:21:06,500 --> 04:21:13,000
And I didn't see it myself, so, but she can speak to it.

2032
04:21:13,000 --> 04:21:15,000
I mean.

2033
04:21:15,000 --> 04:21:21,500
Let's see if I have a, I may have a copy of it.

2034
04:21:21,500 --> 04:21:23,500
Yeah, please, can you?

2035
04:21:23,500 --> 04:21:25,500
We'll get it printed.

2036
04:21:25,500 --> 04:21:27,500
Okay, thank you.

2037
04:21:27,500 --> 04:21:29,500
Our researcher isn't here.

2038
04:21:29,500 --> 04:21:32,000
She would make the run.

2039
04:21:32,000 --> 04:21:34,000
Oh, okay, good enough.

2040
04:21:34,000 --> 04:21:36,000
Thank you.

2041
04:21:36,000 --> 04:21:38,500
So do you have the.

2042
04:21:38,500 --> 04:21:41,000
We're going to get copies.

2043
04:21:41,000 --> 04:21:43,000
You have the number?

2044
04:21:43,000 --> 04:21:45,000
All right, thank you.

2045
04:21:45,000 --> 04:21:47,500
I'm so sorry about that.

2046
04:21:47,500 --> 04:21:58,500
So the Opioid Abatement Trust Fund was established in March 2020 through HB 1639, along with the advisory commission that oversees it.

2047
04:21:58,500 --> 04:22:07,500
The fund is used to support programs associated with the prevention, treatment, and recovery of substance use disorders.

2048
04:22:07,500 --> 04:22:25,000
Representative Snow, Senator Gary Danielson, and Senator Rosenwald did a fine job of crafting that initial legislation to get it all established quickly because a large settlement from the national litigation in Ohio seemed imminent.

2049
04:22:25,000 --> 04:22:33,500
It made perfect sense to establish a trust for New Hampshire given the situation at the time.

2050
04:22:33,500 --> 04:22:43,000
Stakeholders were told that the states with trusts would receive more money under the basic plus bonus settlement model.

2051
04:22:43,000 --> 04:23:00,000
And this model is a formula that rewards states with a larger settlement amount if they have a trust in place and get political subdivisions to agree to the settlements to avoid further litigation.

2052
04:23:00,000 --> 04:23:12,000
There were 23 political subdivisions here in our state, 10 counties and 13 municipalities, that joined the national litigation prior to September 1st, 2019.

2053
04:23:12,000 --> 04:23:20,500
In the calculation, the base is determined by factors such as each state's population, opioid fatalities, etc.

2054
04:23:20,500 --> 04:23:28,500
And the bonus is determined by the percentage of political subdivisions that agreed to the deal.

2055
04:23:28,500 --> 04:23:37,500
New Hampshire largely followed the 70-15-15 model recommended by the judge presiding over the national litigation in Ohio.

2056
04:23:37,500 --> 04:23:43,500
And 70% goes to the opioid abatement trust established by RSA 126A83.

2057
04:23:43,500 --> 04:23:56,000
And 15% goes to the 23 political subdivisions, again, the 10 counties and 13 municipalities that joined the national litigation prior to September 1st, 2019.

2058
04:23:56,000 --> 04:24:00,500
The default model includes 15% share for the state.

2059
04:24:00,500 --> 04:24:07,000
However, New Hampshire has decided to allocate its 15% portion to the trust.

2060
04:24:07,000 --> 04:24:17,000
So currently, it's 85% to the trust and 15% to the 23 political subdivisions that engaged in the original litigation.

2061
04:24:17,000 --> 04:24:38,500
What I'm proposing today is to make changes to that allocation in order to fix a population penalty and provide a more equitable distribution of settlement dollars to the 23 political subdivisions that represent the front lines in New Hampshire's ongoing opioid crisis.

2062
04:24:38,500 --> 04:24:49,500
These 23 subdivisions already have viable and successful programs that should continue to be funded to combat opioid prevention, addiction, and rehabilitation.

2063
04:24:49,500 --> 04:24:59,000
The population penalty that I referred to happens because of how the population is counted in the current formula.

2064
04:24:59,000 --> 04:25:10,500
Right now, the county share is decreased based on the population of a city or town that also participated in the original litigation.

2065
04:25:10,500 --> 04:25:28,000
So, for example, the population of Manchester and Nashua, which is 109,565 and 86,494 respectively, are deducted from the county population of Hillsborough County, 400,721, before calculating it against the total population in New Hampshire.

2066
04:25:28,000 --> 04:25:32,500
This reduces the county's share of the litigation award.

2067
04:25:32,500 --> 04:25:39,000
Counties are therefore penalized because municipalities in their county joined onto the litigation.

2068
04:25:39,000 --> 04:25:59,500
The amount of the penalization happens to Belknap is 39%, Cheshire 30%, Coas 30%, Hillsborough 49%, Merrimack 35%, Rockingham 19%, Stratford 49%, Sullivan County 31%, Carroll County and Grafton County did not have any reductions, did not have any population penalty.

2069
04:25:59,500 --> 04:26:14,500
So this is significant to the counties involved because it reduces funding for the whole range of opioid abatement activities that they already actively engage in at the county level.

2070
04:26:14,500 --> 04:26:23,000
The 23 entities join the litigation because they are the front lines for fighting the opioid epidemic.

2071
04:26:23,000 --> 04:26:32,000
This legislation I propose today increases the share for these 23 political subdivisions from 15% to approximately 53%.

2072
04:26:32,000 --> 04:26:40,000
That still leaves plenty of money in the fund for other municipalities to have access to.

2073
04:26:40,000 --> 04:27:00,500
It also ensures that significant amounts of money are not sitting in the fund being unused because the purpose of the settlement is to get money into the hands of effective programs to combat the opioid problem as soon as possible.

2074
04:27:00,500 --> 04:27:07,000
Getting the money out and distributed to these programs is of utmost importance.

2075
04:27:07,000 --> 04:27:16,500
There will still be plenty of money left in the fund for other political subdivisions to make use of.

2076
04:27:16,500 --> 04:27:26,000
Any other community in the state will be allowed to apply to the abatement trust to fund eligible activities.

2077
04:27:26,000 --> 04:27:34,000
The abatement trust will still receive a significant amount of any present or future settlement dollars.

2078
04:27:34,000 --> 04:27:41,500
And I believe that I'm presenting an equitable formula that is fair to all parties.

2079
04:27:41,500 --> 04:27:56,500
By allowing each subdivision a share of the settlement based on their full population, counties will receive their full and fair share of settlement dollars and solves this population penalty.

2080
04:27:56,500 --> 04:28:02,000
The municipality gets its full share, and so does the county.

2081
04:28:02,000 --> 04:28:08,000
With regard to the current allocation formula, look at it this way.

2082
04:28:08,000 --> 04:28:17,000
15% of any settlement is distributed among the 23 political subdivisions that sued prior to September 1st, 2019.

2083
04:28:17,000 --> 04:28:21,000
So let's say hypothetically the settlement was $1,000.

2084
04:28:21,000 --> 04:28:25,500
In this case, 23 subdivisions would divide up $150.

2085
04:28:25,500 --> 04:28:30,500
And each allocation would be prorated by each subdivision's population.

2086
04:28:30,500 --> 04:28:46,500
The problem is that because there's a mixture of counties and municipalities in the population-based distribution, some people would be counted twice, and you'd end up with a percentage amount over 100%.

2087
04:28:46,500 --> 04:29:00,000
In order to stay within the $150 amount allocated to the entire group, an adjustment, this population penalty, had to be applied to make the math work.

2088
04:29:00,000 --> 04:29:24,500
So really what I want to do here is change it so that the allocation factor calculates each of the 23 political subdivisions' fair share of the settlement first, based on their full population, as opposed to the current model, which calculates a pool of money that is shared.

2089
04:29:24,500 --> 04:29:40,000
So again the current formula creates a pool of funding that is then distributed among the 23 entities by population, whereas my change calculates each entity's direct share of settlement funds.

2090
04:29:40,000 --> 04:29:42,000
Why the difference?

2091
04:29:42,000 --> 04:29:55,000
Because we have a mix of counties and municipalities and we can't evenly distribute a pool of funding because of the double counting of some people.

2092
04:29:55,000 --> 04:29:59,500
And it's needed in order to not penalize counties.

2093
04:29:59,500 --> 04:30:09,000
And that's why I call the 40% number an allocation factor and not just simply call it a distribution.

2094
04:30:09,000 --> 04:30:11,000
So why 40%?

2095
04:30:11,000 --> 04:30:30,000
The basis for choosing 40% allocation factor was to achieve an equitable solution that would provide resources as fast and efficiently as possible to the communities in New Hampshire that represent the front lines of the opioid crisis.

2096
04:30:30,000 --> 04:30:34,500
Other states have changed their allocation models as well.

2097
04:30:34,500 --> 04:30:38,000
Arizona's model provides 56% to local governments.

2098
04:30:38,000 --> 04:30:48,000
Colorado provides 60%, and North Carolina provides 80%, with an additional 15% if they agree to work with the state.

2099
04:30:48,000 --> 04:31:14,000
That is the essence of this bill and the amendment I bring along with it just clarifies the calculation method as well as incorporates a few excellent points and changes that exist in a bill that Senator Rosenwald will also be presenting to her body and that's for them to look at.

2100
04:31:14,000 --> 04:31:27,500
So thank you for sharing your attention and I hope you'll correct the current allocation and equities by passing this bill and its amendment through the committee.

2101
04:31:27,500 --> 04:31:46,500
I also want to add that this bill also makes provisions for changes in when the distributions happen and some reporting changes to the current statute with regard to when the distributions are, how they're managed and distributed.

2102
04:31:46,500 --> 04:31:50,000
So that's basically it for this bill.

2103
04:31:50,000 --> 04:32:15,000
Again, the amendment that I am bringing adds a couple of points that were outlined in Senator Rosenwald's bill, which is to make a change so that the county nursing home supervisor or designee is not appointed by the governor, but is appointed by the New Hampshire Association of Counties.

2104
04:32:15,000 --> 04:32:31,500
And also, we want to add that the duties of the Opioid Abatement Advisory Commission, one of the goals that they want to do is support evidence-based prevention programs and service Thank you.

2105
04:32:31,500 --> 04:32:53,000
that the duties of the Opioid Abatement Advisory Commission, one of the goals that they want to do is support evidence-based prevention programs and services, including efforts to promote healthy, drug-free lifestyles, reduce isolation, build skills and competence, and facilitate community-based prevention efforts.

2106
04:32:53,000 --> 04:33:16,000
So that's the essence of the amendment, is basically to clear up a little bit of the wording for how the calculation is going to, you know, the funds are going to be distributed, as well as add these couple of points from the Senate bill.

2107
04:33:16,000 --> 04:33:19,000
I've got a couple of questions.

2108
04:33:19,000 --> 04:33:27,000
So, so are you trying to make the Senate bill and the House bill more similar?

2109
04:33:27,000 --> 04:33:29,000
A little bit, yeah.

2110
04:33:29,000 --> 04:33:32,000
Is that why you're doing that?

2111
04:33:32,000 --> 04:33:42,500
I figured since I was making a change to clarify one of the paragraphs that I'd also incorporate some of those.

2112
04:33:42,500 --> 04:33:47,500
But even with this, there's still differences between the two?

2113
04:33:47,500 --> 04:33:49,500
No, no.

2114
04:33:49,500 --> 04:33:57,500
I think the only other change was in the Senate bill was that instead of saying...

2115
04:33:57,500 --> 04:33:59,500
That's okay.

2116
04:33:59,500 --> 04:34:02,000
No, no, no, no, no.

2117
04:34:02,000 --> 04:34:04,000
It's very simple.

2118
04:34:04,000 --> 04:34:19,000
Instead of saying that the distribution of funds shall be based on the 2020 census, I think Senator Rosenwald added that it was supposed to be the last decennial census.

2119
04:34:19,000 --> 04:34:38,500
So I'm sitting in for Representative Major, and this kind of thing he always asks, can you provide us a chart of the current law and how the money is allocated, and the bill, how the money is allocated?

2120
04:34:38,500 --> 04:34:43,000
I have a spreadsheet, actually, that would show that.

2121
04:34:43,000 --> 04:34:47,500
Is that something you can give to the committee?

2122
04:34:47,500 --> 04:34:50,500
Yeah, I'll email it to you.

2123
04:34:50,500 --> 04:34:52,500
Can you?

2124
04:34:52,500 --> 04:34:54,500
Sure.

2125
04:34:54,500 --> 04:34:56,500
That would be helpful.

2126
04:34:56,500 --> 04:34:58,500
Sure.

2127
04:34:58,500 --> 04:35:00,500
Okay.

2128
04:35:00,500 --> 04:35:02,500
Representative Elmy.

2129
04:35:02,500 --> 04:35:04,500
Thank you, Mr.

2130
04:35:04,500 --> 04:35:06,500
Chairman.

2131
04:35:06,500 --> 04:35:38,000
Is there a way to do this so that the counties get a fair amount of money, but that you aren't privileging the 13 municipalities, so I have no idea who they were, but managed to join the lawsuit from all the other municipalities in the state that are targeted by the opioid crisis and have been trying to do something about it.

2132
04:35:38,000 --> 04:35:40,000
I'm sorry, I don't...

2133
04:35:40,000 --> 04:36:20,000
It doesn't seem to me that joining the lawsuit qualifies you as at the front of the opioid crisis in this state the counties represent the whole state right but thank you for your question I just want to clarify that the the entities that were initially involved in the lawsuit, they felt that they wanted to put the work in to join the lawsuit because the settlement dollars were very important for programs that they already had in place.

2134
04:36:20,000 --> 04:36:33,500
But the way in which this allocation was initially drawn up penalizes the counties because it's a mixed allocation between counties and the municipalities within those counties.

2135
04:36:33,500 --> 04:36:43,000
And I just wanted to make it more equitable so that the counties are not losing out on dollars.

2136
04:36:43,000 --> 04:37:04,500
Now, the other municipalities that did not join in to the litigation certainly have the ability to apply for funds from this fund for any programs that they may be drawing up or coming up with or ones they already have in place.

2137
04:37:04,500 --> 04:37:23,500
but it's just that so these entities that were at the forefront of this fight and in the legal battle for this you know they can be served more quickly by allocating this out to them more quickly.

2138
04:37:23,500 --> 04:37:25,500
Could I ask...

2139
04:37:25,500 --> 04:37:27,500
Follow, follow.

2140
04:37:27,500 --> 04:37:29,500
Yes, follow.

2141
04:37:29,500 --> 04:37:31,500
Please, thank you.

2142
04:37:31,500 --> 04:37:45,000
What is going on in HHS, which apparently is going to be what all the other towns in the state are going to have to depend on.

2143
04:37:45,000 --> 04:37:48,000
And on is there money yet?

2144
04:37:48,000 --> 04:37:51,500
So do we know what's going on?

2145
04:37:51,500 --> 04:38:14,000
Or do they have plans yet for how they're funding through to be doing this I'm not a heroin problem us and northern Sullivan County since a woman moved in from Boston about 25 years ago and started addicting everybody in the area to heroin.

2146
04:38:14,000 --> 04:38:19,000
And the opioid crisis is dumped on top of that.

2147
04:38:19,000 --> 04:38:33,000
And Dartmouth-Hitchcock has made itself, and we have a number of other places that are working on it too, but has made itself a leader in this area.

2148
04:38:33,000 --> 04:38:35,000
Thank you for that.

2149
04:38:35,000 --> 04:38:41,500
I only know what the allocation is through this opioid abatement trust fund.

2150
04:38:41,500 --> 04:38:59,000
I'm not aware of what other projects or programs DHHS may have which will help municipalities deal with this addiction problem thank you so you mentioned a spreadsheet that I think you're going to provide.

2151
04:38:59,000 --> 04:39:08,500
Does that have on it the list of the identities of the group that did file in the lawsuit?

2152
04:39:08,500 --> 04:39:10,500
Yes.

2153
04:39:10,500 --> 04:39:12,500
So, okay.

2154
04:39:12,500 --> 04:39:14,500
Yes.

2155
04:39:14,500 --> 04:39:18,500
I want to be sure we get that.

2156
04:39:18,500 --> 04:39:22,000
That's all I'm going to have to.

2157
04:39:22,000 --> 04:39:24,000
Yeah, absolutely.

2158
04:39:24,000 --> 04:39:29,000
I can read them out to you if you'd like.

2159
04:39:29,000 --> 04:39:31,000
Well.

2160
04:39:31,000 --> 04:39:33,000
we can wait.

2161
04:39:33,000 --> 04:39:35,000
Okay.

2162
04:39:35,000 --> 04:39:37,000
Okay.

2163
04:39:37,000 --> 04:39:39,500
Thank you very, very much.

2164
04:39:39,500 --> 04:39:41,500
Any other questions?

2165
04:39:41,500 --> 04:39:43,500
No, thank you.

2166
04:39:43,500 --> 04:39:45,500
Appreciate it.

2167
04:39:45,500 --> 04:39:47,500
Thank you.

2168
04:39:47,500 --> 04:39:57,500
Before we call up a net witness, I've got to everybody, I have to meet with the governor at three.

2169
04:39:57,500 --> 04:40:03,000
So about five minutes to three, I'm going to be leaving.

2170
04:40:03,000 --> 04:40:07,500
Representative Almi's ranking member is going to be chairing.

2171
04:40:07,500 --> 04:40:14,000
So I'm going to call up James Buffetti from the Department of Justice.

2172
04:40:14,000 --> 04:40:21,500
And I apologize that I may be leaving in the middle of your testimony, sir.

2173
04:40:21,500 --> 04:40:25,500
And there are two other cards after that.

2174
04:40:25,500 --> 04:40:27,500
Thank you much mr.

2175
04:40:27,500 --> 04:41:13,000
chairman my name is James Buffetti I'm an associate attorney general I'm the director of the division of legal counsel at the DOJ and since 2015 I've been the state's lead prosecutor in all of its opioid litigation and there are many cases that are working its way where we're going to begin a trial on February 1st in Merrimack County Superior Court against Johnson & Johnson for what we allege are their deceptive opioid sales and for bringing in huge amounts of opioids into this state, causing a public nuisance.

2176
04:41:13,000 --> 04:41:18,000
I'm here to testify in strong opposition to this bill.

2177
04:41:18,000 --> 04:41:21,500
And let me explain to you why.

2178
04:41:21,500 --> 04:41:28,000
When this legislation was crafted, we reached an agreement with the litigating subdivisions.

2179
04:41:28,000 --> 04:41:38,500
And that was an agreement where we all shook hands and said, this is a fair way of using the money.

2180
04:41:38,500 --> 04:41:47,000
15% of whatever money would come in off the top would go to those 23 litigating subdivisions.

2181
04:41:47,000 --> 04:41:56,000
The state would take no money and put all of the 85% into the opioid abatement trust fund.

2182
04:41:56,000 --> 04:42:01,000
So let's talk a little bit about these litigating subdivisions.

2183
04:42:01,000 --> 04:42:06,500
I've been litigating cases against the opioid companies for since 2015.

2184
04:42:06,500 --> 04:42:16,500
All of the work, all of the work in litigating these cases have been done by the Department of Justice.

2185
04:42:16,500 --> 04:42:22,000
None of the work have been done by these litigating subdivisions.

2186
04:42:22,000 --> 04:42:24,000
Here's some frank talk.

2187
04:42:24,000 --> 04:42:45,000
What happened here was an outside law firm came in and convinced the counties and some political subdivisions to file a generic lawsuit and that they would work on a contingency fee basis and they promised them them huge amounts of money.

2188
04:42:45,000 --> 04:42:58,500
All of those cases were then sent to the federal court in Ohio, which is a multi-district litigation court, and all of those cases have been stayed.

2189
04:42:58,500 --> 04:43:03,500
There has been absolutely no litigation done on those cases.

2190
04:43:03,500 --> 04:43:13,000
It is not true to say that they are on the forefront because I applaud them for filing lawsuits.

2191
04:43:13,000 --> 04:43:16,000
They didn't join a national lawsuit.

2192
04:43:16,000 --> 04:43:22,500
They filed individual generic complaints and all of those cases have been stayed.

2193
04:43:22,500 --> 04:43:28,000
There has been no discovery, no depositions, no litigation at all.

2194
04:43:28,000 --> 04:44:21,000
So the question is how do they do those 23 subdivisions that filed these generic lawsuits with the help of contingency fee council how to how do they get the bulk of this money to the exclusion of every other community in New Hampshire and there's no good answer for that because you know go to go to Exeter or go to Portsmouth or go to Hudson or Hooksit or Pelham or Peterborough and say to them you didn't get pitched a deal by an outside counsel you didn't file this generic lawsuit therefore you don't get any of these We think that is completely unfair.

2195
04:44:21,000 --> 04:44:33,500
We think it doesn't address the opioid abatement problem in this state and we strongly oppose it and would urge you to reject this bill.

2196
04:44:33,500 --> 04:44:45,500
There is a there is a format in place and the format provides that 85% of this money goes to an opioid abatement commission.

2197
04:44:45,500 --> 04:44:49,500
That commission hasn't even begun its work yet.

2198
04:44:49,500 --> 04:44:51,500
We just approved rules.

2199
04:44:51,500 --> 04:44:56,500
Those are going in front of Jelka later this year.

2200
04:44:56,500 --> 04:44:59,000
Hopefully they will approve it.

2201
04:44:59,000 --> 04:45:22,500
The object is to take all that money to receive applications from any political subdivision in the state and to figure out what is the best way of spending money to abate the opioid crisis, whether it's to a state agency or to the town of Hudson.

2202
04:45:22,500 --> 04:45:30,500
But each agency would have the opportunity to make an application to the Opioid Abatement Commission.

2203
04:45:30,500 --> 04:45:37,000
We would then try and figure out how to juggle those competing interests.

2204
04:45:37,000 --> 04:45:52,500
And then what our recommendations would be made to the governor and executive council for them to award contracts that they thought were the best way of dealing with this crisis.

2205
04:45:52,500 --> 04:45:55,500
That's the system for doing it.

2206
04:45:55,500 --> 04:45:59,000
That's the fair system for doing it.

2207
04:45:59,000 --> 04:46:08,500
That's a way that we can have a commission that is made up of state of the state rep.

2208
04:46:08,500 --> 04:46:10,500
There's a state senator.

2209
04:46:10,500 --> 04:46:19,500
There are county officials, city town officials, treatment people, a broad range of 22 or so commission members.

2210
04:46:19,500 --> 04:46:27,500
We can work as a group to figure out the best way of spending this money.

2211
04:46:27,500 --> 04:46:30,500
That's the way to do it.

2212
04:46:30,500 --> 04:46:50,500
And frankly, I'm disappointed that the people who sat across the table and shook my hand and agreed to a compromise bill that became what is law have now reneged on that because that's not what we had agreed to.

2213
04:46:50,500 --> 04:47:02,500
And this was a framework that should be allowed to actually play out and to see if we need to change it, that's fine.

2214
04:47:02,500 --> 04:47:06,500
The time for doing that is not now.

2215
04:47:06,500 --> 04:47:11,000
Okay, I got a quick question before I leave.

2216
04:47:11,000 --> 04:47:15,500
I hate to leave, and this is very interesting.

2217
04:47:15,500 --> 04:47:19,000
So how much money has been settled?

2218
04:47:19,000 --> 04:47:23,500
How much money are we talking about right now?

2219
04:47:23,500 --> 04:47:29,000
I know that it sounds like there's other cases as well.

2220
04:47:29,000 --> 04:47:39,500
It sounds like the AG's office is going to be managing those funds, like you're doing a lot of other settlements.

2221
04:47:39,500 --> 04:47:46,000
So how much, how much, is any settlement money come in as yet?

2222
04:47:46,000 --> 04:47:48,000
Yes.

2223
04:47:48,000 --> 04:47:58,500
So there has been one small settlement, which by the way, that those, those 23 political subdivisions never got involved with.

2224
04:47:58,500 --> 04:48:04,000
They never even named that person, that company, as a defendant.

2225
04:48:04,000 --> 04:48:15,000
It was a company called McKinsey, which was an advertising group that helped Purdue Pharma and Johnson & Johnson hyper-sale their opioids.

2226
04:48:15,000 --> 04:48:17,000
They settled.

2227
04:48:17,000 --> 04:48:21,500
New Hampshire received their first payment of $2.7 million.

2228
04:48:21,500 --> 04:48:56,000
Under the statute, 15% of that was distributed to those 23 subdivisions so for approximately four hundred and fifteen thousand dollars were distributed according to the population of those of those districts so that money has gone out there was approximately two point three million dollars in the opioid trust fund we're waiting for Jelka to approve the rules so that we can beginning getting get that money out.

2229
04:48:56,000 --> 04:49:05,500
Trust me, our goal is to get that money and to get it out as quickly as we can.

2230
04:49:05,500 --> 04:49:14,000
I expect with all the different settlements that we're talking millions of dollars over maybe 18 years.

2231
04:49:14,000 --> 04:49:29,000
But I mean, I, 150 million, I don't, I mean, it's hard to predict, but it's gonna be millions of dollars that will come into the state over 18 years.

2232
04:49:29,000 --> 04:49:43,500
And the goal is to figure out the best way of doing it so that we can prevent people from dying on the streets of Nashua from opioid overdoses.

2233
04:49:43,500 --> 04:49:45,500
Okay, questions, Urza, Ames.

2234
04:49:45,500 --> 04:49:58,500
So as I understand it, you had a handshake deal that did provide 15% to this group of political subdivisions and counties, I guess, who filed.

2235
04:49:58,500 --> 04:50:10,500
And that tells me that going into the discussion that led to that handshake deal, your position was they should get less than 15%.

2236
04:50:10,500 --> 04:50:12,500
Right.

2237
04:50:12,500 --> 04:50:18,000
And that's sort of consistent with what you've said to us.

2238
04:50:18,000 --> 04:50:21,000
And so you made a deal.

2239
04:50:21,000 --> 04:50:26,500
And 15% was a little above what you thought was right.

2240
04:50:26,500 --> 04:50:31,500
It was below, obviously, what that group thought was right.

2241
04:50:31,500 --> 04:50:34,000
And that was the deal.

2242
04:50:34,000 --> 04:50:36,500
Do I understand it correctly?

2243
04:50:36,500 --> 04:50:38,500
Yes.

2244
04:50:38,500 --> 04:50:51,500
So our position is, and I think the state law supports it, the complaints that these subdivisions brought, they shouldn't have been bringing them at all.

2245
04:50:51,500 --> 04:50:53,500
They weren't state claims.

2246
04:50:53,500 --> 04:50:55,500
They weren't local claims.

2247
04:50:55,500 --> 04:50:58,500
They didn't belong to Sullivan County.

2248
04:50:58,500 --> 04:51:00,500
Those were state claims.

2249
04:51:00,500 --> 04:51:11,500
And that so we could have gone into court and asked a court to extinguish all of those cases the subdivisions brought.

2250
04:51:11,500 --> 04:51:13,500
And they knew that.

2251
04:51:13,500 --> 04:51:28,500
And because they knew that, we were able to reach, we figured, look, it's much better to try and reach an agreement, right, instead of having to go and litigate.

2252
04:51:28,500 --> 04:51:42,500
So they all knew that, and we showed them the case that said you can't bring these, these aren't state claims, these aren't local claims, they're state claims.

2253
04:51:42,500 --> 04:51:51,000
And so as a compromise we said how about if 15% off the top goes to you.

2254
04:51:51,000 --> 04:52:52,000
I still don't understand why they should get 15% because again they didn't I mean they filed complaints I get it there their contingency fee council on their behalf filed these generic complaints but that's all they did why does that entitle them to to these extra payments to the exclusion of all the rest of the state it no one can answer that question for me there's not a good answer for that and frankly it's a it's you know it's a problem but it's a it's a deal that we reached and so when that money came in from McKinsey we we complied with the statute we paid the 15% out as quickly as we could to those litigating subdivisions.

2255
04:52:52,000 --> 04:52:59,500
And and can I just say that there was a point made about double counting.

2256
04:52:59,500 --> 04:53:08,500
So you know know, I mean, I haven't seen the amendment, so I can't speak to the amendment.

2257
04:53:08,500 --> 04:53:19,500
But I can tell you that the original copy of the bill, it changed dramatically the way that this money was distributed.

2258
04:53:19,500 --> 04:53:23,500
So we don't want to double count people.

2259
04:53:23,500 --> 04:53:31,500
So for instance, in Hillsborough County, Manchester was one of those litigating subdivisions, as was Nashua.

2260
04:53:31,500 --> 04:54:51,000
And so in order to be fair to the rest of the state, we have to deduct the population of Manchester, the population of Nashua from Hillsborough County to figure out how much that Hillsborough County should get because Nashua and Manchester are getting a portion of that and so that's not that's that's preventing double counting so that that there is money then they can go to to Belknap County and to Coas County that because otherwise Hillsborough would get all the money in this in the settlement and let me say also that you know maybe this has changed in the amendment but if you read in the the bill from line 7 to 9 this is what this is what the bill says the distribution of funds shall be based on the 2020 census population of each qualifying county and political subdivision, multiplied by the amount of the settlement, multiplied by an allocation factor of 40.

2261
04:54:51,000 --> 04:54:53,500
Well, I'm not a mathematician.

2262
04:54:53,500 --> 04:54:56,000
I would readily admit it.

2263
04:54:56,000 --> 04:55:02,000
But if you spin that out, so Manchester has 109,000 people approximately.

2264
04:55:02,000 --> 04:55:06,000
Say we get a settlement of $5 million.

2265
04:55:06,000 --> 04:55:12,500
You multiply 109 by 5 million, which is what it says you do.

2266
04:55:12,500 --> 04:55:16,000
You get a figure of 545 billion.

2267
04:55:16,000 --> 04:55:21,500
And then you multiply it by 40%, you get $218 billion.

2268
04:55:21,500 --> 04:55:23,500
That can't be right.

2269
04:55:23,500 --> 04:55:30,000
I don't know what that formula means, but it's not a usable formula.

2270
04:55:30,000 --> 04:55:55,000
The other thing that hasn't been mentioned is that there's a provision, maybe this has changed in the amendment, but there's a provision starting in line 12 that says that no later than January 15, any outstanding balance in the trust fund shall be distributed just to those 23 subdivisions.

2271
04:55:55,000 --> 04:56:04,500
So, for instance, we settle with a company and we get a payment on January 5th of $10 million.

2272
04:56:04,500 --> 04:56:06,500
Right?

2273
04:56:06,500 --> 04:56:08,500
$10 million.

2274
04:56:08,500 --> 04:57:11,500
According to this bill, on January 15th, all $10 million goes just to those 23 subdivisions how can that be I mean that just that just that just can't that does is not a workable thing and and not to mention this you know there's this questions about if there's encumbered funds that have been awarded but not yet left the the trust fund the legislation doesn't mention that but you know those are things that obviously could be clarified the general the general principle though that you would reward these subdivisions to the exclusion of so many others in the state it is something that at the AG's office looking at the larger picture of the entire state and the needs, we could not support.

2275
04:57:11,500 --> 04:57:13,500
All set, Representative.

2276
04:57:13,500 --> 04:57:30,000
And to the point you just made, and maybe my question is relative, it may not be, but was the handshake agreement on the first settlement, or is it all settlements going forward?

2277
04:57:30,000 --> 04:57:32,000
It's all settlements.

2278
04:57:32,000 --> 04:57:40,500
So it was way before that settlement was It was prior to this legislation of being proposed.

2279
04:57:40,500 --> 04:57:45,500
So we as a group of City and County officials.

2280
04:57:45,500 --> 04:57:48,000
It was a working group.

2281
04:57:48,000 --> 04:58:45,500
We put together this bill that became what is now RSA 126 a 83 to 86 and and we it because we we knew that we needed to have a structure in place to deal with these opioid funds and we knew that we had to use these monies these monies for opioid abatement purposes because we wouldn't have been able to accept the monies because this is how they were coming through with these settlements so the the bankruptcy judge in Purdue Pharma, right, in White Plains, New York, made it very clear that all of the money that we would receive, when we do receive it, has to be used for opioid abatement.

2282
04:58:45,500 --> 04:58:59,000
So we needed a structure in the state to deal with this influx of opioid funds from any source to any source, any subdivision that received money.

2283
04:58:59,000 --> 04:59:01,500
So we proposed this bill.

2284
04:59:01,500 --> 04:59:08,500
We had hearings in the House and the Senate, and the bill was passed.

2285
04:59:08,500 --> 04:59:17,500
This settlement that I talked about, this McKinsey settlement, happened a year or so after all that happened.

2286
04:59:17,500 --> 04:59:19,500
Any further questions?

2287
04:59:19,500 --> 04:59:21,500
Okay.

2288
04:59:21,500 --> 04:59:23,500
Thank you questions?

2289
04:59:23,500 --> 04:59:25,500
Okay.

2290
04:59:25,500 --> 04:59:28,000
Thank you for your testimony.

2291
04:59:28,000 --> 04:59:30,000
Thank you very much.

2292
04:59:30,000 --> 04:59:33,500
Derek Furland, if I'm pronouncing this correctly.

2293
04:59:33,500 --> 04:59:35,500
Thank you.

2294
04:59:35,500 --> 04:59:37,500
thank you mr.

2295
04:59:37,500 --> 05:00:15,500
chair and once again ladies and gentlemen of the committee thank you for providing me this opportunity to speak with you today once again Derek Furland I'm the county manager for Sullivan County passing around my written testimony as well as a letter of support from the New Hampshire Association of counties so rather than review what's being provided to you right now I guess I probably make better use of my time responding to mr.

2296
05:00:15,500 --> 05:00:17,500
some of mr.

2297
05:00:17,500 --> 05:00:26,000
buffetti's, as well as some of the questions that have been asked thus far of Representative Aaron.

2298
05:00:26,000 --> 05:00:30,000
I think the handshake deal characterized by Mr.

2299
05:00:30,000 --> 05:00:39,000
Buffetti and the fact that it was legislation that was crafted, I think the word crafted is generous.

2300
05:00:39,000 --> 05:00:45,000
I think this legislation was put together in a very compressed timeline.

2301
05:00:45,000 --> 05:00:51,000
And I don't mean to say that as a negative or derogatory.

2302
05:00:51,000 --> 05:00:59,500
That timeline was thrust upon us and was driven by events in that national litigation in Ohio.

2303
05:00:59,500 --> 05:01:22,000
The thought process at the time was that a settlement was imminent and that states that had a trust that would protect these funds and ensure that they were spent on opioid abatement activities would in fact get a larger share of the settlement dollars.

2304
05:01:22,000 --> 05:01:26,000
So it was one to protect the funds.

2305
05:01:26,000 --> 05:01:36,500
I think there was too much institutional memory of the tobacco settlement when funding did not go towards tobacco related abatement.

2306
05:01:36,500 --> 05:01:50,500
So it was a hedge against to protect the interests of the defendants as well as a deal to try to get more cooperation from among the states.

2307
05:01:50,500 --> 05:02:00,500
So that all happened in the fall of 2019 after the normal process and window for submitting legislation had passed.

2308
05:02:00,500 --> 05:03:13,000
So it was, again, I'd say rushed through, but I don't mean to say that in a negative or derogatory manner it was just simply a pragmatic way to try to get this legislation done um so it subsequently was not subject to the standard uh review process that most bills are subject to like what we're doing here today um and then by the time that the final bill was being circulated it was now march of 2020 and everyone's collective focus was was squarely on covid so it just didn't quite have the same level of scrutiny and i think some of the uh what i would characterize as defects of that original legislation are what we're trying to rectify through this proposed bill um but as far as the handshake deal there there never was a grand bargain of all 23 entities.

2309
05:03:13,000 --> 05:03:18,000
I mean Sullivan County was never represented in those negotiations.

2310
05:03:18,000 --> 05:03:39,500
So I'm not exactly who was in the room with the Attorney General's staff, but I can assure you that it was not anything that was representative of all the interests and equities of the 23 parties that had joined that national litigation.

2311
05:03:39,500 --> 05:03:56,000
As far as the claim that the subdivisions haven't done any work, there's been a lot of work done, just maybe not that has been on the radar of the Attorney General's office.

2312
05:03:56,000 --> 05:04:11,000
We've spent hundreds of hours justifying the past expenses, working with our national attorneys in hopes of trying to bolster those negotiations of what that future settlement would look like.

2313
05:04:11,000 --> 05:04:26,000
But when the focus was not so much on past claims as it was on future abatement activities, a lot of that work unfortunately has kind of gone for naught.

2314
05:04:26,000 --> 05:04:30,500
But it doesn't eliminate the fact that we did.

2315
05:04:30,500 --> 05:04:45,500
The county staff spent hundreds of hours detailing all of the opioid-related costs that we've incurred, whether it's through the county attorney's offices, the sheriff's offices, or our county jails.

2316
05:04:45,500 --> 05:04:48,500
And those costs have been significant.

2317
05:04:48,500 --> 05:04:53,500
Yes, it's true the state is suing Johnson & Johnson.

2318
05:04:53,500 --> 05:05:03,500
I guess I'd remind the committee that Johnson & Johnson currently is 2-0 in their various lawsuits across the country.

2319
05:05:03,500 --> 05:05:11,500
So I wish the Attorney General's staff well, and I hope that they have better success.

2320
05:05:11,500 --> 05:05:18,500
But so far, they've proven to be a pretty formidable opponent in other courts.

2321
05:05:18,500 --> 05:05:25,000
The national litigation that we have joined has over 30 litigants and defendants.

2322
05:05:25,000 --> 05:05:29,500
The state has taken action against just a handful.

2323
05:05:29,500 --> 05:05:43,500
So the prospect of more settlement dollars coming to the state ostensibly will be a result of the fact that we are taking action against the 30-plus defendants.

2324
05:05:43,500 --> 05:06:02,500
Again, those resources will be shared according to the formula in the trust, I want to make it sound like this is an adversarial thing between the counties and the municipalities that joined in the Attorney General's office.

2325
05:06:02,500 --> 05:06:07,500
I think there's been a tremendous opportunity for some collaboration.

2326
05:06:07,500 --> 05:06:35,000
I mean, by working together, we're going to enhance the amount of settlement dollars that come to the state of New Hampshire, and that's driven by the base plus bonus scheme that the national settlement is proposing, which simply just the more subdivisions join in with the state, then the greater the share will be.

2327
05:06:35,000 --> 05:06:48,500
So I know Sullivan County has agreed to join in, and I'm quite confident that most, if not all, of the other 23 subdivisions have as well.

2328
05:06:48,500 --> 05:07:08,500
As far as a previous comment or question about the perceived unfairness with the 23 that did decide to join and other towns and cities in the state that did not join, all I can simply say is two points.

2329
05:07:08,500 --> 05:07:16,500
Number one, there was a 15-month window where any entity could have joined this national lawsuit.

2330
05:07:16,500 --> 05:07:26,000
We joined in June of 2018, and any entity had until September 1st of 2019 to decide to join.

2331
05:07:26,000 --> 05:07:31,500
And I'll say that the bar for joining was very low.

2332
05:07:31,500 --> 05:07:40,000
It was simply a letter signed by our governing board authorizing us to join the national litigation.

2333
05:07:40,000 --> 05:07:43,000
So very, very easy to join.

2334
05:07:43,000 --> 05:07:58,500
Number two is that even with this revised formula, there is still going to be a significant amount of funding under the purview of this trust and governed by the commission.

2335
05:07:58,500 --> 05:08:18,000
So any entity that decided not to join for whatever reason can still avail themselves of this trust, which again will have a significant amount of funding in it to help them with their opioid abatement activities and programs.

2336
05:08:18,000 --> 05:08:58,500
One other note on the population penalty, you know, this just, the urgency and the importance with which we wanted to address this in this bill was simply because the counties are a separate entity and we have our own programs that are distinct, and I would argue in some cases, maybe not for all 10 counties, but certainly in Sullivan, the programs that we run absolutely dwarf any of the opioid abatement activities that are performed by our municipal brethren.

2337
05:08:58,500 --> 05:09:03,500
Our county jail, we have in-house, in-resident drug treatment programs.

2338
05:09:03,500 --> 05:09:06,000
We have counselors and clinicians.

2339
05:09:06,000 --> 05:09:08,000
We provide medical-assisted treatment.

2340
05:09:08,000 --> 05:09:14,500
And these programs and these people, they cost quite a bit of money.

2341
05:09:14,500 --> 05:09:34,000
We also are in the final stages of opening a transitional housing facility in the city of Claremont that's going to have up to 28 beds for people who are transitioning out of our Department of Corrections treatment program.

2342
05:09:34,000 --> 05:09:39,000
That program will also cost quite a bit of money.

2343
05:09:39,000 --> 05:09:48,500
So to the extent that we can leverage these funds, it just saves our county taxpayers that much money.

2344
05:09:48,500 --> 05:09:50,500
The distribution language Mr.

2345
05:09:50,500 --> 05:09:53,500
Buffetti pointed out, he's absolutely right.

2346
05:09:53,500 --> 05:10:07,000
That language was confusing, and it was absolutely not the intent of the original bill that was drafted to drain the fund no later than January 15th.

2347
05:10:07,000 --> 05:10:14,500
That language has subsequently been rectified in the proposed amendment that Representative Aaron has provided.

2348
05:10:14,500 --> 05:10:51,000
So we concurred with his with his concerns that that it was confusing and we and we took steps to fix that and then as far one last point I wanted to make too is with regard to where are the front lines in this crisis yes every community has been touched by this there's no doubt about it we have believe, 232 towns and cities or 234, and we have 10 counties.

2349
05:10:51,000 --> 05:11:06,000
And there's not a single person in this room who probably hasn't personally got some experience of the negative side of opioid addiction and the evils that come with it.

2350
05:11:06,000 --> 05:11:20,500
I will say that of the 23 entities that joined the national litigation, the 13 municipalities represent 10 of the 13 largest cities in the state of New Hampshire.

2351
05:11:20,500 --> 05:11:26,500
Altogether is about 40, approaching 40 percent of the state's total population.

2352
05:11:26,500 --> 05:11:42,500
So giving more resources directly to those entities, I think, is a sensible and pragmatic thing to do given the amount of people that we're talking, the communities that we're talking about.

2353
05:11:42,500 --> 05:11:45,500
It's Manchester, Nashua, Concord, Keene, Laconia.

2354
05:11:45,500 --> 05:11:52,000
You know, this is where the largest population centers are in the state.

2355
05:11:52,000 --> 05:11:58,000
That's where the biggest opioid problems are on a per capita basis.

2356
05:11:58,000 --> 05:12:16,000
And so I think it's right to provide those resources directly to them and not have to necessarily go through the bureaucracy and I don't again don't mean that in a pejorative manner but as Mr.

2357
05:12:16,000 --> 05:13:07,000
Buffetti mentioned the the commission is still a year onward trying to figure out their rules for for getting those grants I'll tell you that the $9,300 that Sullivan County received last year as part of that McKinsey settlement we had spent within a month it was easy easy because we had the construction for our sober housing project, but it just goes to show that we have ongoing plans and programs that need funding and having to wait for rulemaking and to compete with other grants, I think, um, is not the best way to go about combating the opioid crisis.

2358
05:13:07,000 --> 05:13:10,500
Pending any questions, that concludes my statement.

2359
05:13:10,500 --> 05:13:37,000
Thank you for your time okay representative Ames thank you so I'm back to the handshake deal I'm just trying to understand what happened and maybe it's a misnomer for all I know but was this group of litigating, filing municipalities and counties represented by the same council or group of law firms?

2360
05:13:37,000 --> 05:13:40,000
There are a few law firms.

2361
05:13:40,000 --> 05:14:19,500
My understanding is that the national firm that we have represents most of the counties but not all and a handful of the municipalities, but I couldn't you who they are off the top of my head so where I'm going to and you may see this but it's one thing if if the deal really didn't involve everybody and that you weren't wasn't a point person or a point law firm that was talking to the Attorney General.

2362
05:14:19,500 --> 05:14:26,500
If that's the case, if there wasn't such an arrangement, then there's no deal.

2363
05:14:26,500 --> 05:14:42,500
But if indeed you were talking, you had somebody who was negotiating with the Attorney General, then that sounds very different to me and something that we have to worry about here.

2364
05:14:42,500 --> 05:14:54,000
Well, I can tell you our attorney did not support the legislation that's drafted, so I don't know if our attorney had conversations.

2365
05:14:54,000 --> 05:15:03,000
I mean, there's a lot going on, and so I haven't really kept up with every single conversation.

2366
05:15:03,000 --> 05:15:06,000
I'll also mention the 70-15-15 structure.

2367
05:15:06,000 --> 05:15:13,500
That was a default structure of an allocation model that Judge Polster in Ohio recommended.

2368
05:15:13,500 --> 05:15:19,000
This wasn't something that we crafted in whatever those negotiations were.

2369
05:15:19,000 --> 05:15:24,000
So that was just, that was the standard default model.

2370
05:15:24,000 --> 05:15:38,000
And as Representative Aaron mentioned, some states have decided that's not going to work for them and they want more money to go directly to the front lines.

2371
05:15:38,000 --> 05:15:41,500
And I think we should follow suit.

2372
05:15:41,500 --> 05:15:44,500
Any further questions thank you mr.

2373
05:15:44,500 --> 05:15:59,500
Furland testimony I've got one last pink card and for the life of me I can't make out Tom's skin no worries no worries my My name is Tom Mullins.

2374
05:15:59,500 --> 05:16:04,000
I'm the city attorney for the city of Keene.

2375
05:16:04,000 --> 05:16:13,000
And thank you to the chair and to the committee for taking the time to talk with us.

2376
05:16:13,000 --> 05:16:22,500
I was only coming here basically to tell you that I support the bill as amended at this point.

2377
05:16:22,500 --> 05:16:33,500
But I have to tell you quite frankly that after hearing the comments of the associate attorney general, I'm a bit shocked.

2378
05:16:33,500 --> 05:16:35,500
I'm also very unhappy.

2379
05:16:35,500 --> 05:16:42,500
It's hard for me not to take some personal and professional umbrage at that.

2380
05:16:42,500 --> 05:16:54,000
I'm sure that Attorney Buffetti wasn't expecting anything like that and I'm sure that we could shake hands and move on after this.

2381
05:16:54,000 --> 05:16:56,000
But here's the reality.

2382
05:16:56,000 --> 05:17:13,500
The reality is that we met with the Attorney General at that point and with Attorney Buffetti, a number of us, the communities, the counties, when this issue about creating this trust was first raised.

2383
05:17:13,500 --> 05:17:23,000
And I know that I specifically objected to using the MBTE trust as a model for these settlement proceeds.

2384
05:17:23,000 --> 05:17:29,500
We also objected to the 15% that was being suggested at that point.

2385
05:17:29,500 --> 05:17:45,500
At that meeting, there was a request on the members who were there to participate in a working group to try and craft some legislation to present with respect to these issues.

2386
05:17:45,500 --> 05:17:53,500
I know I volunteered to be on that group and I think that there were others.

2387
05:17:53,500 --> 05:18:00,500
I never heard another word from the Attorney General's office with respect to this.

2388
05:18:00,500 --> 05:18:17,000
I've worked very closely with our outside legal counsel and as far as I understand and know any conversations that they had with the Attorney General's office also echoed those concerns and comments.

2389
05:18:17,000 --> 05:18:25,500
To the extent that the Attorney General picked a working group, that's certainly the Attorney General's prerogative.

2390
05:18:25,500 --> 05:18:28,500
I wasn't involved in that group.

2391
05:18:28,500 --> 05:18:31,500
That's certainly the Attorney General's prerogative.

2392
05:18:31,500 --> 05:18:49,000
but to represent that all of us who participated either in that meeting or with respect to the underlying litigation signed off on this agreement in some kind of deal is really troubling to me.

2393
05:18:49,000 --> 05:18:56,000
As far as I'm concerned, that raises the question of bad faith in negotiations.

2394
05:18:56,000 --> 05:19:07,000
In order to have bad faith in negotiations, it seems to me you need to be in negotiations in the first place.

2395
05:19:07,000 --> 05:19:09,500
So none of that happened.

2396
05:19:09,500 --> 05:19:14,500
So with all due respect to the Associate Attorney General.

2397
05:19:14,500 --> 05:19:30,500
With respect to the amendments that are being proposed on this, the way it first went into the committee and the way you have it now was something even I objected to.

2398
05:19:30,500 --> 05:19:34,500
I know that Attorney Buffetti raised that concern.

2399
05:19:34,500 --> 05:19:49,500
When you first read the language, all of the proceeds essentially went to the 23 municipalities or the settling entities, and then everybody else got cut out of that process.

2400
05:19:49,500 --> 05:19:51,500
We had that conversation.

2401
05:19:51,500 --> 05:19:54,000
I said, that's not appropriate.

2402
05:19:54,000 --> 05:20:03,500
That wasn't what the intention was at this point, and they needed to be able to have those funds.

2403
05:20:03,500 --> 05:20:12,000
With respect to who's on the forefront and who isn't, I think that there's a confusion here.

2404
05:20:12,000 --> 05:20:15,500
The forefront isn't necessarily the litigation itself.

2405
05:20:15,500 --> 05:20:27,000
The forefront is all the human cost that's happened out there in these municipalities and in the counties with respect to this crisis.

2406
05:20:27,000 --> 05:20:36,000
To say that we haven't been on the forefront of the opioid crisis is beyond disingenuous, quite frankly.

2407
05:20:36,000 --> 05:20:44,000
Our police, our fire, our human services, our hospitals, they're the ones dealing with this crisis.

2408
05:20:44,000 --> 05:20:57,000
And as the county administrator pointed out, the 23 municipalities and counties that are involved in this are the bulk of the population in this state.

2409
05:20:57,000 --> 05:20:59,000
We need these funds.

2410
05:20:59,000 --> 05:21:13,500
I'm here to support the 40% allocation directly to these municipalities with the understanding that the town of Greenfield can file a request for money if they need that.

2411
05:21:13,500 --> 05:21:16,000
That was never the intention.

2412
05:21:16,000 --> 05:21:27,500
But the obvious reality is we need to be able to have the resources because this is a continuing crisis at this point.

2413
05:21:27,500 --> 05:21:29,500
I know, Mr.

2414
05:21:29,500 --> 05:21:35,000
Chairman, you're looking at your watch, and I apologize for that.

2415
05:21:35,000 --> 05:21:37,000
I said five minutes.

2416
05:21:37,000 --> 05:21:39,000
Not my purpose.

2417
05:21:39,000 --> 05:21:47,500
I had to take a few of those minutes to assuage my professional unhappiness at this point.

2418
05:21:47,500 --> 05:22:07,000
So I would urge you to consider and to pass and to make a recommendation on this, on the 40% allocation, for us to take the money to be able to do what we need to do with it.

2419
05:22:07,000 --> 05:22:25,500
And I suppose the last comment that I'd like to make, barring any questions at this point, and again, and I do have to correct the Associate Attorney General, he made reference to a case Thank you.

2420
05:22:25,500 --> 05:22:49,500
comment that I'd like to make, barring any questions at this point, and again, and I do have to correct the Associate Attorney General, he made reference to a case that the Attorney General's office represented would just allow them to scoop whatever litigation we had out there.

2421
05:22:49,500 --> 05:22:56,000
That was the city of Dover, the state via the city of Dover.

2422
05:22:56,000 --> 05:22:58,000
It happened in 2006.

2423
05:22:58,000 --> 05:23:09,000
Just point out to the committee and anybody who may be otherwise listening, that case arose in a very different procedural context.

2424
05:23:09,000 --> 05:23:26,000
This is not a slam dump for the Attorney General's office to pull these cases away from the municipalities and into the state, and I raised that with the Attorney General at that meeting.

2425
05:23:26,000 --> 05:23:35,000
The reality is we, City of Keene, the other municipalities initiated a lawsuit, numerous lawsuits on this crisis.

2426
05:23:35,000 --> 05:23:42,000
And I believe, I could be wrong about this, before the state initiated anything.

2427
05:23:42,000 --> 05:23:50,500
This idea that we didn't do anything as part of this litigation is again just not factual.

2428
05:23:50,500 --> 05:24:11,000
We had to collect information through our fire department, police department, human services department, all of the information we collect with respect to the cost that we had to expend for this crisis and are continuing to expend on this crisis.

2429
05:24:11,000 --> 05:24:28,500
So I would urge you please to consider this amendment and to adopt the HB 1565 as the amendment has been presented to you and I'm happy to answer any questions that you may have.

2430
05:24:28,500 --> 05:24:30,500
Thank you.

2431
05:24:30,500 --> 05:24:32,500
Any questions?

2432
05:24:32,500 --> 05:24:34,500
Representative Balmy.

2433
05:24:34,500 --> 05:24:36,500
Thank you.

2434
05:24:36,500 --> 05:25:11,000
I can sympathize with you, but I wanted to ask if you would be willing to accept that we are all on the forefront of this, that there is no forefront, that it is all over the state, that the very small towns, that the small cities that did not participate because they don't have as much capacity as the bigger ones do to do that, also need help.

2435
05:25:11,000 --> 05:25:31,000
and does that context does this the way it is written now give twice as much help per population to the bigger places than to the smaller places on its face the bill provides more resources to those 23 municipalities.

2436
05:25:31,000 --> 05:25:34,000
There is no doubt about that.

2437
05:25:34,000 --> 05:25:42,500
But again, as was pointed out, those municipalities constitute a bulk of the population in the state.

2438
05:25:42,500 --> 05:25:55,000
In response to your question, it's still true that the other municipalities who didn't participate, who didn't have either the technical expertise or didn't understand.

2439
05:25:55,000 --> 05:25:59,000
I used to live in a small community.

2440
05:25:59,000 --> 05:26:01,000
I know that.

2441
05:26:01,000 --> 05:26:05,500
I used to be the moderator in my town.

2442
05:26:05,500 --> 05:26:13,000
We could never call outside legal counsel because it costs money to do that, right?

2443
05:26:13,000 --> 05:26:26,500
So we understand that and the bill doesn't take away anything from them other than the additional monies that are going to go to the 23 municipalities.

2444
05:26:26,500 --> 05:26:41,000
And back to your comment earlier that was made, if you don't mind, Madam, is the idea that the counties, remember, the counties and the municipalities have different responsibilities.

2445
05:26:41,000 --> 05:27:23,000
The municipalities have the fire departments, have the police departments, have the human services departments, not that the counties don don't have human services but there's a mix of responsibilities between those two so just providing the funds to the counties would not resolve the issues on the local level thank you but being that they are different I've been doing this for 26 years now so I pretty well and I started with the county stuff on that given that they are different.

2446
05:27:23,000 --> 05:27:40,500
I've been doing this for 26 years now, so I pretty well, and I started with the county stuff, that given that they are different, doing different things, you can't say there are 23 municipalities.

2447
05:27:40,500 --> 05:28:51,500
There are 10 counties which are operating on county stuff all over the state, and there are the 13 largest cities in the state yes and then leaving out everybody else uh well rather leaving out everybody else not leaving them out right but leaving them in a much later and lesser position in terms of getting funding well remember even Even under the existing bill bill those entities that didn't file a lawsuit prior to September 1st of 2019 are still in the same position with respect to that they still have to apply through the committee for grant funding and not in that kind of thing and just to point out we have concerns about that as well I to our public works director before I came over here, because this is modeled on the MBTE settlement that was approved.

2448
05:28:51,500 --> 05:29:01,000
And we've had unbelievable difficulties trying to get any money out of the MBTE settlement with respect to that.

2449
05:29:01,000 --> 05:29:10,000
And I hear that primarily part of the reason for that is there's a rules problem on that.

2450
05:29:10,000 --> 05:29:17,000
And we've heard that this entity hasn't established its rules either at this point.

2451
05:29:17,000 --> 05:29:24,500
So going through that bureaucracy to try and get funding is going to be challenging.

2452
05:29:24,500 --> 05:29:26,500
Okay.

2453
05:29:26,500 --> 05:29:28,500
Which means left out.

2454
05:29:28,500 --> 05:29:30,500
Representative Schomburg.

2455
05:29:30,500 --> 05:29:32,500
Thank you, Mr.

2456
05:29:32,500 --> 05:29:34,500
Chairman.

2457
05:29:34,500 --> 05:29:37,000
Thank you for your presentation.

2458
05:29:37,000 --> 05:29:39,000
You mentioned about accounting.

2459
05:29:39,000 --> 05:29:50,000
Is there an accounting procedure that each of these towns or subdivisions or counties will have to submit to the AG's office?

2460
05:29:50,000 --> 05:29:52,500
The simple answer is yes.

2461
05:29:52,500 --> 05:30:00,500
Funds that come in even through the statute as amended are needed to be accounted for.

2462
05:30:00,500 --> 05:30:05,000
They're through the committee and HHS, I'm pretty sure.

2463
05:30:05,000 --> 05:30:11,500
Is that a simpler process than what is being asked of you now?

2464
05:30:11,500 --> 05:30:19,000
Well, so far we've only received $7,500, so it's been fairly simple at this point.

2465
05:30:19,000 --> 05:30:38,500
But our finance department has already geared up to account for the funds and other spent any further question fantastic thank you very much for your time all right and seeing no other pink slips close testimony on 1565.

2466
05:30:38,500 --> 05:30:42,000
Oh, I didn't have the blue sheet.

2467
05:30:42,000 --> 05:30:45,000
John, Representative Janigian, do you mind?

2468
05:30:45,000 --> 05:30:47,000
My apologies.

2469
05:30:47,000 --> 05:30:49,000
Thank you.

2470
05:30:49,000 --> 05:30:51,500
I didn't want the job.

2471
05:30:51,500 --> 05:30:53,500
Okay, four.

2472
05:30:53,500 --> 05:30:56,000
We have seven people, four.

2473
05:30:56,000 --> 05:31:04,500
Representative Judy Aaron, Derek Furland, Mary Bork, Kate Horgan, Walter Stapleton, Representative Cloutier, Tom Mullins, James Buffetti.

2474
05:31:04,500 --> 05:31:06,500
I'm sorry.

2475
05:31:06,500 --> 05:31:08,500
Those were the four.

2476
05:31:08,500 --> 05:31:12,500
And against are James Profetti and Kate Frey.

2477
05:31:12,500 --> 05:31:14,500
Thank you, Representative.

2478
05:31:14,500 --> 05:31:30,000
I'd just like to request in future that since we don't, people don't remember the rules anymore, but if you're doing the testimony, you aren't supposed to sign the blue sheet.

2479
05:31:30,000 --> 05:31:35,500
So maybe we could just not read those that have testified.

2480
05:31:35,500 --> 05:31:37,500
Thank you.

2481
05:31:37,500 --> 05:31:39,500
Thank you all.

2482
05:31:39,500 --> 05:31:41,500
See you Thursday.

2483
05:31:41,500 --> 05:31:44,000
Here, you edited it, correct?

2484
05:31:44,000 --> 05:31:46,000
Thank you.

2485
05:31:46,000 --> 05:31:48,000
Thank you.
