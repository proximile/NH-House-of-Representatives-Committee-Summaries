9 uh the the amended version which came
 
00:08:04.629 --> 00:08:04.639 align:start position:0%
before the house last session after
 
00:08:08.390 --> 00:08:08.400 align:start position:0%
being retained from the 2019
 
00:08:12.550 --> 00:08:12.560 align:start position:0%
session um the election law committee as
 
00:08:16.390 --> 00:08:16.400 align:start position:0%
it existed then held several bipartisan
 
00:08:19.909 --> 00:08:19.919 align:start position:0%
subcommittee work sessions on that
 
00:08:22.629 --> 00:08:22.639 align:start position:0%
Amendment and after reaching
 
00:08:26.430 --> 00:08:26.440 align:start position:0%
comes to satisfy members on both sides
 
00:08:30.950 --> 00:08:30.960 align:start position:0%
produce the cacr that you have you today
 
00:08:33.909 --> 00:08:33.919 align:start position:0%
I hope that all of us can agree that
 
00:08:36.990 --> 00:08:37.000 align:start position:0%
redistri can affect our own chances
 
00:08:39.670 --> 00:08:39.680 align:start position:0%
being Mander
 
00:08:42.310 --> 00:08:42.320 align:start position:0%
against on who does the
 
00:08:45.550 --> 00:08:45.560 align:start position:0%
redistricting this cacr does not go into
 
00:08:49.509 --> 00:08:49.519 align:start position:0%
the details of creating a
 
00:08:52.230 --> 00:08:52.240 align:start position:0%
non-biased uh commission but would
 
00:08:55.150 --> 00:08:55.160 align:start position:0%
simply put into the Constitution the
 
00:08:58.190 --> 00:08:58.200 align:start position:0%
will of the people that one should be
 
00:09:02.430 --> 00:09:02.440 align:start position:0%
cre uh leaving the details of that
 
00:09:06.110 --> 00:09:06.120 align:start position:0%
commission to be placed into statute uh
 
00:09:09.230 --> 00:09:09.240 align:start position:0%
the idea with that being that uh if the
 
00:09:12.670 --> 00:09:12.680 align:start position:0%
commission details need to be tweaked
 
00:09:13.829 --> 00:09:13.839 align:start position:0%
after its
 
00:09:17.230 --> 00:09:17.240 align:start position:0%
creation that's more simply done through
 
00:09:21.269 --> 00:09:21.279 align:start position:0%
statute rather than re amending the
 
00:09:23.750 --> 00:09:23.760 align:start position:0%
Constitution uh I know this committee
 
00:09:27.190 --> 00:09:27.200 align:start position:0%
has House Bill 121 before it which
 
00:09:29.710 --> 00:09:29.720 align:start position:0%
proposes one method for Crea creting
 
00:09:33.230 --> 00:09:33.240 align:start position:0%
such a commission and how that would
 
00:09:37.150 --> 00:09:37.160 align:start position:0%
F at on HP
 
00:09:40.470 --> 00:09:40.480 align:start position:0%
1221 uh I heard one legislator who was
 
00:09:44.030 --> 00:09:44.040 align:start position:0%
opposed to that bill CIT lack of
 
00:09:47.150 --> 00:09:47.160 align:start position:0%
constitutional Authority as his reason
 
00:09:50.710 --> 00:09:50.720 align:start position:0%
for opposing that bill because it names
 
00:09:54.829 --> 00:09:54.839 align:start position:0%
the legislature as the source for
 
00:09:57.230 --> 00:09:57.240 align:start position:0%
redistricting that is one of the reasons
 
00:10:00.670 --> 00:10:00.680 align:start position:0%
I bring this cacr for forward to have
 
00:10:04.110 --> 00:10:04.120 align:start position:0%
the Constitutional enable such a
 
00:10:06.750 --> 00:10:06.760 align:start position:0%
statute but in the final analysis this
 
00:10:09.910 --> 00:10:09.920 align:start position:0%
would allow the voters of New Hampshire
 
00:10:12.230 --> 00:10:12.240 align:start position:0%
to decide if this would be the fairest
 
00:10:14.670 --> 00:10:14.680 align:start position:0%
way to
 
00:10:16.670 --> 00:10:16.680 align:start position:0%
redistricting and that's my main
 
00:10:19.750 --> 00:10:19.760 align:start position:0%
objective is to give the people the
 
00:10:23.030 --> 00:10:23.040 align:start position:0%
right to weigh in on this
 
00:10:27.150 --> 00:10:27.160 align:start position:0%
subject I have also presented for your
 
00:10:31.550 --> 00:10:31.560 align:start position:0%
consideration uh the amendment Z
 
00:10:36.750 --> 00:10:36.760 align:start position:0%
29h which just rewords the uh o
 
00:10:39.550 --> 00:10:39.560 align:start position:0%
Clause just a little additional
 
00:10:42.710 --> 00:10:42.720 align:start position:0%
language um which was actually suggested
 
00:10:43.949 --> 00:10:43.959 align:start position:0%
by a
 
00:10:46.750 --> 00:10:46.760 align:start position:0%
constituent um that concludes my
 
00:10:49.389 --> 00:10:49.399 align:start position:0%
presentation if there are questions I
 
00:10:51.550 --> 00:10:51.560 align:start position:0%

and transparent system for redistricting
 
00:12:30.670 --> 00:12:30.680 align:start position:0%
our state specifically they want an
 
00:12:32.949 --> 00:12:32.959 align:start position:0%
independent redistricting commission to
 
00:12:36.590 --> 00:12:36.600 align:start position:0%
do the work it's important to them how
 
00:12:39.110 --> 00:12:39.120 align:start position:0%
do I know this because at last year's
 
00:12:41.670 --> 00:12:41.680 align:start position:0%
town meeting the residents of Hillsboro
 
00:12:44.030 --> 00:12:44.040 align:start position:0%
passed a resolution in support of the
 
00:12:47.230 --> 00:12:47.240 align:start position:0%
establishment of such a commission I've
 
00:12:48.990 --> 00:12:49.000 align:start position:0%
received a letter from the selectman
 
00:12:51.870 --> 00:12:51.880 align:start position:0%
asking me to dis to support the
 
00:12:53.790 --> 00:12:53.800 align:start position:0%
establishment of an independent
 
00:12:55.949 --> 00:12:55.959 align:start position:0%
redistricting commission whenever it
 
00:12:57.509 --> 00:12:57.519 align:start position:0%
comes before us
 
00:13:00.470 --> 00:13:00.480 align:start position:0%
here we know that bills to establish a
 
00:13:02.269 --> 00:13:02.279 align:start position:0%
redistricting commission had
 
00:13:04.870 --> 00:13:04.880 align:start position:0%
overwhelming bipartisan support in the
 
00:13:08.590 --> 00:13:08.600 align:start position:0%
past but the belief was that the con was
 
00:13:10.949 --> 00:13:10.959 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional and it prevented them
 
00:13:13.829 --> 00:13:13.839 align:start position:0%
from becoming law Madame chair and
 
00:13:15.829 --> 00:13:15.839 align:start position:0%
members of the committee this is a
 
00:13:19.550 --> 00:13:19.560 align:start position:0%
nonpartisan request from my purplish red
 
00:13:22.189 --> 00:13:22.199 align:start position:0%
District it's time that we put the
 
00:13:24.110 --> 00:13:24.120 align:start position:0%
voters of the
 
00:13:26.790 --> 00:13:26.800 align:start position:0%
state allow them to make their wishes
 
00:13:29.470 --> 00:13:29.480 align:start position:0%

an
 
00:15:24.590 --> 00:15:24.600 align:start position:0%
amendment uh that I don't know if you

00:15:30.949 --> 00:15:30.959 align:start position:0%
the details in it that the original Bill
 
00:15:34.550 --> 00:15:34.560 align:start position:0%
did when I wrote my testimony yesterday
 
00:15:36.910 --> 00:15:36.920 align:start position:0%
and sent it to you electronically I did
 
00:15:39.990 --> 00:15:40.000 align:start position:0%
not have this amendment however I knew
 
00:15:42.590 --> 00:15:42.600 align:start position:0%
there was one coming so I'd like to
 
00:15:46.309 --> 00:15:46.319 align:start position:0%
address the concept of a redistricting
 
00:15:48.990 --> 00:15:49.000 align:start position:0%
commission uh and then try to address
 
00:15:51.430 --> 00:15:51.440 align:start position:0%
this um amended
 
00:15:54.550 --> 00:15:54.560 align:start position:0%
version however I would direct you to my
 
00:15:56.230 --> 00:15:56.240 align:start position:0%
testimony that
 
00:15:59.110 --> 00:15:59.120 align:start position:0%
details the very negative negative
 
00:16:01.790 --> 00:16:01.800 align:start position:0%
process that happened in 2011 that
 
00:16:04.870 --> 00:16:04.880 align:start position:0%
resulted in lawsuits that made the
 
00:16:06.910 --> 00:16:06.920 align:start position:0%
public very angry about the
 
00:16:09.389 --> 00:16:09.399 align:start position:0%
redistricting process that's what we
 
00:16:12.870 --> 00:16:12.880 align:start position:0%
want to avoid this year already there
 
00:16:15.829 --> 00:16:15.839 align:start position:0%
are 15 States including two of our
 
00:16:18.309 --> 00:16:18.319 align:start position:0%
neighbors Maine and Vermont and two
 
00:16:20.509 --> 00:16:20.519 align:start position:0%
other states of the Northeast New York
 
00:16:23.430 --> 00:16:23.440 align:start position:0%
and Rhode Island that have independent
 
00:16:23.440 --> 00:16:25.030 align:start position:0%
and Rhode Island that have independent
redistricting

00:16:25.030 --> 00:16:25.040 align:start position:0%
redistricting
 
00:16:27.670 --> 00:16:27.680 align:start position:0%
commissions and they adopted those
 
00:16:29.790 --> 00:16:29.800 align:start position:0%
commissions because of the Public's
 
00:16:35.189 --> 00:16:35.199 align:start position:0%
demand for a fair process in 2019 in the
 
00:16:38.550 --> 00:16:38.560 align:start position:0%
uh Supreme Court case of rucho versus
 
00:16:41.430 --> 00:16:41.440 align:start position:0%
North Carolina and Maryland the Supreme
 
00:16:44.189 --> 00:16:44.199 align:start position:0%
Court basically said it's not up to us
 
00:16:46.910 --> 00:16:46.920 align:start position:0%
to cure the problems of partisan
 
00:16:50.590 --> 00:16:50.600 align:start position:0%
districting it is up to the states and
 
00:16:52.790 --> 00:16:52.800 align:start position:0%
that's what I hope we will do here in
 
00:16:52.800 --> 00:16:53.710 align:start position:0%
that's what I hope we will do here in
New

00:16:53.710 --> 00:16:53.720 align:start position:0%
New
 
00:16:56.949 --> 00:16:56.959 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um I'm sure everybody in this
 
00:17:00.389 --> 00:17:00.399 align:start position:0%
room was as appalled as I was when on
 
00:17:05.189 --> 00:17:05.199 align:start position:0%
January 23rd Steve stepanic running for
 
00:17:08.829 --> 00:17:08.839 align:start position:0%
um a partisan uh leadership position
 
00:17:13.150 --> 00:17:13.160 align:start position:0%
within his party um pointed out that one
 
00:17:15.990 --> 00:17:16.000 align:start position:0%
party was in the majority and said
 
00:17:19.189 --> 00:17:19.199 align:start position:0%
because of this we control redistricting
 
00:17:21.909 --> 00:17:21.919 align:start position:0%
I can stand here today and guarantee you
 
00:17:24.270 --> 00:17:24.280 align:start position:0%
that we will send a Conservative
 
00:17:27.510 --> 00:17:27.520 align:start position:0%
Republican to Washington DC as a
 
00:17:29.950 --> 00:17:29.960 align:start position:0%
congress person in
 
00:17:32.750 --> 00:17:32.760 align:start position:0%
2022 no matter which party you were on
 
00:17:35.669 --> 00:17:35.679 align:start position:0%
I'm sure you're appalled at the idea
 
00:17:38.870 --> 00:17:38.880 align:start position:0%
that here is a leader in the party
 
00:17:42.830 --> 00:17:42.840 align:start position:0%
saying we will gerrymander to ensure
 
00:17:45.870 --> 00:17:45.880 align:start position:0%
congressional representation from one
 
00:17:49.310 --> 00:17:49.320 align:start position:0%
party uh so it is in that spirit that I
 
00:17:53.669 --> 00:17:53.679 align:start position:0%
ask you please to consider this bill as
 
00:17:57.190 --> 00:17:57.200 align:start position:0%
a way to make sure the voters voices
 
00:17:58.950 --> 00:17:58.960 align:start position:0%
will be heard
 
00:18:01.870 --> 00:18:01.880 align:start position:0%
the voters that want Fair districting
 
00:18:03.990 --> 00:18:04.000 align:start position:0%
they want their candidates to stand an
 
00:18:07.070 --> 00:18:07.080 align:start position:0%
equal chance um no matter which party
 
00:18:09.710 --> 00:18:09.720 align:start position:0%
they're from uh and this is an
 
00:18:12.630 --> 00:18:12.640 align:start position:0%
opportunity to do that it calls for
 
00:18:16.029 --> 00:18:16.039 align:start position:0%
transparency it calls for nonpartisan
 
00:18:19.470 --> 00:18:19.480 align:start position:0%
criteria in this process so I thank you
 
00:18:22.029 --> 00:18:22.039 align:start position:0%
for this opportunity to speak to you
 
00:18:24.430 --> 00:18:24.440 align:start position:0%
again uh and I'd be glad to take
 
00:18:26.590 --> 00:18:26.600 align:start position:0%
questions if you have any and I'd
 
00:18:28.909 --> 00:18:28.919 align:start position:0%
certainly take questions uh
 
00:18:31.510 --> 00:18:31.520 align:start position:0%
via email if you have any to my uh
 
00:18:34.549 --> 00:18:34.559 align:start position:0%
written testimony thank you very much
 
00:18:37.029 --> 00:18:37.039 align:start position:0%
thank you questions for members from the
 
00:18:38.830 --> 00:18:38.840 align:start position:0%
committee president in the
 
00:18:42.070 --> 00:18:42.080 align:start position:0%
room representative Bri thank you madam
 
00:18:46.909 --> 00:18:46.919 align:start position:0%
chair since 2011 when the Republicans
 
00:18:49.590 --> 00:18:49.600 align:start position:0%
were in charge of redistricting in the
 
00:18:52.390 --> 00:18:52.400 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire have we only
 
00:18:57.110 --> 00:18:57.120 align:start position:0%
elected Republican members to the
 
00:18:59.789 --> 00:18:59.799 align:start position:0%
Congress uh thank you for that question
 
00:19:03.630 --> 00:19:03.640 align:start position:0%
no in fact the reverse is true uh
 
00:19:06.110 --> 00:19:06.120 align:start position:0%
redistricting that's done for partisan
 
00:19:09.950 --> 00:19:09.960 align:start position:0%
purposes is not necessarily
 
00:19:12.310 --> 00:19:12.320 align:start position:0%
successful uh the districts could be
 
00:19:14.990 --> 00:19:15.000 align:start position:0%
drawn differently so that there would be
 
00:19:19.230 --> 00:19:19.240 align:start position:0%
that outcome uh in fact in District One
 
00:19:21.750 --> 00:19:21.760 align:start position:0%
the position of Congress person has
 
00:19:24.270 --> 00:19:24.280 align:start position:0%
flipped back and forth from Republican
 
00:19:27.430 --> 00:19:27.440 align:start position:0%
to Democrat several times over those
 
00:19:27.440 --> 00:19:28.990 align:start position:0%
to Democrat several times over those
years

00:19:28.990 --> 00:19:29.000 align:start position:0%
years
 
00:19:31.830 --> 00:19:31.840 align:start position:0%
um there are certainly other diff
 
00:19:34.950 --> 00:19:34.960 align:start position:0%
differences the state senate has been
 
00:19:38.590 --> 00:19:38.600 align:start position:0%
perhaps more impacted and certainly the
 
00:19:41.230 --> 00:19:41.240 align:start position:0%
executive Council in New Hampshire has
 
00:19:43.549 --> 00:19:43.559 align:start position:0%
been more impacted by deliberate
 
00:19:49.909 --> 00:19:49.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:52.430 --> 00:19:52.440 align:start position:0%

um my name is Louise Spencer I'm from
 
00:20:45.549 --> 00:20:45.559 align:start position:0%
Conquer New Hampshire and I am a
 
00:20:48.310 --> 00:20:48.320 align:start position:0%
co-founder of the Kent Street Coalition
 
00:20:51.190 --> 00:20:51.200 align:start position:0%
we're an all volunteer Grassroots
 
00:20:51.200 --> 00:20:52.549 align:start position:0%
we're an all volunteer Grassroots
advocacy

00:20:52.549 --> 00:20:52.559 align:start position:0%
advocacy
 
00:20:54.990 --> 00:20:55.000 align:start position:0%
organization um which at this point has
 
00:20:57.149 --> 00:20:57.159 align:start position:0%
members from across the state and I
 
00:21:01.830 --> 00:21:01.840 align:start position:0%
would say that uh all of universally our
 
00:21:04.830 --> 00:21:04.840 align:start position:0%
members support and in fact actively
 
00:21:07.830 --> 00:21:07.840 align:start position:0%
advocate for nonpartisan redistricting
 
00:21:11.950 --> 00:21:11.960 align:start position:0%
it's one of our our top priority issues
 
00:21:15.110 --> 00:21:15.120 align:start position:0%
um like but today I I am here speaking
 
00:21:17.390 --> 00:21:17.400 align:start position:0%
on my own behalf from my own
 
00:21:20.070 --> 00:21:20.080 align:start position:0%
experiences and one of which is like
 
00:21:22.750 --> 00:21:22.760 align:start position:0%
many of you I've uh I have my own
 
00:21:25.710 --> 00:21:25.720 align:start position:0%
political leanings and I'm not afraid to
 
00:21:28.310 --> 00:21:28.320 align:start position:0%
fight as hard as I can for the things I
 
00:21:30.870 --> 00:21:30.880 align:start position:0%
believe in fighting in a in a peaceful
 
00:21:34.710 --> 00:21:34.720 align:start position:0%
way um but I do believe in a fair fight
 
00:21:37.269 --> 00:21:37.279 align:start position:0%
and I believe that competition usually
 
00:21:39.789 --> 00:21:39.799 align:start position:0%
brings us closer to compromise and the
 
00:21:42.590 --> 00:21:42.600 align:start position:0%
best path forward and that's why I'm
 
00:21:47.269 --> 00:21:47.279 align:start position:0%
here today I ask you to support cacr 4
 
00:21:49.590 --> 00:21:49.600 align:start position:0%
which would enshrine this concept of
 
00:21:53.549 --> 00:21:53.559 align:start position:0%
fairness into our state constitution uh
 
00:21:56.549 --> 00:21:56.559 align:start position:0%
making clear that the right to choose
 
00:21:58.909 --> 00:21:58.919 align:start position:0%
our elected representatives
 
00:22:02.310 --> 00:22:02.320 align:start position:0%
belongs solely to the people and not to
 
00:22:06.190 --> 00:22:06.200 align:start position:0%
a party or to vested special interests
 
00:22:09.789 --> 00:22:09.799 align:start position:0%
we I believe must unequivocally declare
 
00:22:13.430 --> 00:22:13.440 align:start position:0%
that anyone buying for the privilege to
 
00:22:15.669 --> 00:22:15.679 align:start position:0%
represent the goodest citizens of our
 
00:22:18.430 --> 00:22:18.440 align:start position:0%
state uh must be prepared to come
 
00:22:21.269 --> 00:22:21.279 align:start position:0%
forward with good ideas and intent not
 
00:22:23.909 --> 00:22:23.919 align:start position:0%
with jiggered maps all but guaranteeing
 
00:22:28.149 --> 00:22:28.159 align:start position:0%
a win if like me you have gone door too
 
00:22:31.390 --> 00:22:31.400 align:start position:0%
knocking you've heard it many times over
 
00:22:34.230 --> 00:22:34.240 align:start position:0%
and over again probably as I have that
 
00:22:36.950 --> 00:22:36.960 align:start position:0%
voting doesn't matter and that no one
 
00:22:40.990 --> 00:22:41.000 align:start position:0%
cares what I think we hear cries to
 
00:22:44.669 --> 00:22:44.679 align:start position:0%
throw the bums out drain the swamp um
 
00:22:47.909 --> 00:22:47.919 align:start position:0%
cries for term limits and these are the
 
00:22:50.149 --> 00:22:50.159 align:start position:0%
cries of frustration by people who don't
 
00:22:53.269 --> 00:22:53.279 align:start position:0%
think their voice or their vote
 
00:22:57.029 --> 00:22:57.039 align:start position:0%
matters uh too often the culprit too
 
00:22:59.350 --> 00:22:59.360 align:start position:0%
often the right actually and too often
 
00:23:03.110 --> 00:23:03.120 align:start position:0%
the culprit is um partisan Jerry
 
00:23:06.750 --> 00:23:06.760 align:start position:0%
mandering um the election is already
 
00:23:09.909 --> 00:23:09.919 align:start position:0%
determined before a single vote is cast
 
00:23:12.870 --> 00:23:12.880 align:start position:0%
um or it's determined in a primary where
 
00:23:14.990 --> 00:23:15.000 align:start position:0%
the winning candidate of one party is
 
00:23:17.549 --> 00:23:17.559 align:start position:0%
all but guaranteed a win in the general
 
00:23:19.950 --> 00:23:19.960 align:start position:0%
election we see that in the US House
 
00:23:22.630 --> 00:23:22.640 align:start position:0%
only about 60 seats are considered truly
 
00:23:24.990 --> 00:23:25.000 align:start position:0%
competitive the others have been favored
 
00:23:26.990 --> 00:23:27.000 align:start position:0%
to drawn have been drawn to favor
 
00:23:30.190 --> 00:23:30.200 align:start position:0%
incumbents of one party or the other
 
00:23:31.510 --> 00:23:31.520 align:start position:0%
that means that in
 
00:23:34.390 --> 00:23:34.400 align:start position:0%
86% of these districts the results have
 
00:23:37.390 --> 00:23:37.400 align:start position:0%
already been declared and decided I'm
 
00:23:39.549 --> 00:23:39.559 align:start position:0%
not declared I'm sorry but decided by
 
00:23:41.230 --> 00:23:41.240 align:start position:0%
the November
 
00:23:44.549 --> 00:23:44.559 align:start position:0%
election um and this is a problem of
 
00:23:47.470 --> 00:23:47.480 align:start position:0%
both parties the lore of power is just
 
00:23:50.310 --> 00:23:50.320 align:start position:0%
too tempting elections are supposed to
 
00:23:52.950 --> 00:23:52.960 align:start position:0%
be a check on that Temptation not an
 
00:23:55.950 --> 00:23:55.960 align:start position:0%
endorsement of it maps are drawn to
 
00:23:58.430 --> 00:23:58.440 align:start position:0%
protect parties to protect incum to
 
00:24:01.549 --> 00:24:01.559 align:start position:0%
protect special interests uh to protect
 
00:24:05.830 --> 00:24:05.840 align:start position:0%
everyone but the voter with cacr 4 we
 
00:24:08.669 --> 00:24:08.679 align:start position:0%
have the opportunity to change that to
 
00:24:11.430 --> 00:24:11.440 align:start position:0%
restore fairness and power to Those whom
 
00:24:14.149 --> 00:24:14.159 align:start position:0%
our con Constitution is supposed to
 
00:24:17.190 --> 00:24:17.200 align:start position:0%
protect and that's the voter so I I
 
00:24:20.510 --> 00:24:20.520 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my testimony and um
 
00:24:23.789 --> 00:24:23.799 align:start position:0%
again would incourage support for this
 
00:24:26.070 --> 00:24:26.080 align:start position:0%
bill in a firmly

7th 2006 constitutional amendment to R
 
00:28:59.789 --> 00:28:59.799 align:start position:0%
districting that our towns had uh that
 
00:29:02.190 --> 00:29:02.200 align:start position:0%
our communities passed and this really
 
00:29:05.110 --> 00:29:05.120 align:start position:0%
called on towns with a significant
 
00:29:07.669 --> 00:29:07.679 align:start position:0%
population to have their own
 
00:29:10.549 --> 00:29:10.559 align:start position:0%
representative um 10 years ago
 
00:29:12.750 --> 00:29:12.760 align:start position:0%
legislators ignored our
 
00:29:16.789 --> 00:29:16.799 align:start position:0%
Constitution and the voters wishes 62
 
00:29:21.190 --> 00:29:21.200 align:start position:0%
towns out of 152 were denied their own
 
00:29:23.269 --> 00:29:23.279 align:start position:0%
representation I want you to know that
 
00:29:25.590 --> 00:29:25.600 align:start position:0%
voters supported this Constitutional
 
00:29:30.789 --> 00:29:30.799 align:start position:0%
Amendment um in 200 six 240,000 voters
 
00:29:33.549 --> 00:29:33.559 align:start position:0%
to 100,000 voters so this was favored by
 
00:29:37.549 --> 00:29:37.559 align:start position:0%
the by a large majority of people um Liz
 
00:29:40.269 --> 00:29:40.279 align:start position:0%
tantarelli from the league um quoted the
 
00:29:42.870 --> 00:29:42.880 align:start position:0%
party leadership but I wanted to just
 
00:29:46.190 --> 00:29:46.200 align:start position:0%
comment that I really hope that this
 
00:29:48.029 --> 00:29:48.039 align:start position:0%
committee the special committee on
 
00:29:50.350 --> 00:29:50.360 align:start position:0%
redistricting and the whole legislative
 
00:29:53.310 --> 00:29:53.320 align:start position:0%
body will be accountable to the voters
 
00:29:55.269 --> 00:29:55.279 align:start position:0%
and not party
 
00:29:57.389 --> 00:29:57.399 align:start position:0%
leadership and I'm going to quote Daniel
 
00:30:00.389 --> 00:30:00.399 align:start position:0%
Webster um in his quote The People's
 
00:30:03.350 --> 00:30:03.360 align:start position:0%
Government is made for the people made
 
00:30:05.590 --> 00:30:05.600 align:start position:0%
by the people and accountable to the
 
00:30:08.909 --> 00:30:08.919 align:start position:0%
people partisan Jerry Mandarin is
 
00:30:12.710 --> 00:30:12.720 align:start position:0%
perpetuated by Bad actors of any party
 
00:30:15.909 --> 00:30:15.919 align:start position:0%
and is bad for towns it's bad for the
 
00:30:19.669 --> 00:30:19.679 align:start position:0%
voters and no matter what happens I
 
00:30:21.750 --> 00:30:21.760 align:start position:0%
think it's really important that voters
 
00:30:24.509 --> 00:30:24.519 align:start position:0%
have faith in the process um and they
 
00:30:27.549 --> 00:30:27.559 align:start position:0%
believe in an honest and in um
 
00:30:29.389 --> 00:30:29.399 align:start position:0%
government of
 
00:30:32.870 --> 00:30:32.880 align:start position:0%
Integrity executive District Council 2
 
00:30:35.230 --> 00:30:35.240 align:start position:0%
is a district that really can
 
00:30:38.350 --> 00:30:38.360 align:start position:0%
demonstrate um what happens when you
 
00:30:41.870 --> 00:30:41.880 align:start position:0%
pack uh Democratic voters into one
 
00:30:46.590 --> 00:30:46.600 align:start position:0%
District um I do also want to um 10
 
00:30:50.830 --> 00:30:50.840 align:start position:0%
years ago when when the house passed
 
00:30:53.029 --> 00:30:53.039 align:start position:0%
redistricting um according to the house
 
00:30:57.629 --> 00:30:57.639 align:start position:0%
journal and um Senator uh Republican I
 
00:31:00.149 --> 00:31:00.159 align:start position:0%
representative David Pierce I wanted to
 
00:31:01.310 --> 00:31:01.320 align:start position:0%
call him a senator because that's what
 
00:31:02.870 --> 00:31:02.880 align:start position:0%
he was after he was a member of your
 
00:31:05.470 --> 00:31:05.480 align:start position:0%
committee but 10 years ago he cited in
 
00:31:07.590 --> 00:31:07.600 align:start position:0%
the house Journal that there was a
 
00:31:10.509 --> 00:31:10.519 align:start position:0%
24-hour notice for the public to give
 
00:31:13.750 --> 00:31:13.760 align:start position:0%
com to give public input on the plan and
 
00:31:17.549 --> 00:31:17.559 align:start position:0%
I think it's really um as you all look
 
00:31:19.110 --> 00:31:19.120 align:start position:0%
at this bill and look at the
 
00:31:21.230 --> 00:31:21.240 align:start position:0%
redistricting process moving forward I
 
00:31:26.149 --> 00:31:26.159 align:start position:0%
hope you will um care for a
 
00:31:28.710 --> 00:31:28.720 align:start position:0%
transparent process that allows voters
 
00:31:31.029 --> 00:31:31.039 align:start position:0%
input and allows New Hampshire to be
 
00:31:33.789 --> 00:31:33.799 align:start position:0%
represented Fairly New Hampshire has a
 
00:31:36.509 --> 00:31:36.519 align:start position:0%
proud tradition of civic participation
 
00:31:39.230 --> 00:31:39.240 align:start position:0%

i' like to preface this with Now for
 
00:33:20.750 --> 00:33:20.760 align:start position:0%
Something Completely
 
00:33:23.750 --> 00:33:23.760 align:start position:0%
Different okay this is this is an act
 
00:33:26.029 --> 00:33:26.039 align:start position:0%
requiring town and City Clerks to
 
00:33:29.269 --> 00:33:29.279 align:start position:0%
provide electronic dailying notification
 
00:33:32.389 --> 00:33:32.399 align:start position:0%
to the Secretary of State this bill I
 
00:33:34.350 --> 00:33:34.360 align:start position:0%
was planning on doing this some years
 
00:33:36.590 --> 00:33:36.600 align:start position:0%
ago and I keep forgetting so anyway this
 
00:33:38.830 --> 00:33:38.840 align:start position:0%
is my seventh
 
00:33:41.110 --> 00:33:41.120 align:start position:0%
term this bill was brought up because
 
00:33:43.149 --> 00:33:43.159 align:start position:0%
some Town clerks are waiting until the
 
00:33:46.389 --> 00:33:46.399 align:start position:0%
last day of filing before sending in the
 
00:33:48.909 --> 00:33:48.919 align:start position:0%
documentations documents to Secretary
 
00:33:51.470 --> 00:33:51.480 align:start position:0%
State how you know the Secretary State
 
00:33:53.950 --> 00:33:53.960 align:start position:0%
records daily the filings of all office
 
00:33:56.629 --> 00:33:56.639 align:start position:0%
C candidates this is a way for residents
 
00:33:59.789 --> 00:33:59.799 align:start position:0%
to see see who or if anyone has filed
 
00:34:01.950 --> 00:34:01.960 align:start position:0%
talking to my town clerk she was under
 
00:34:04.549 --> 00:34:04.559 align:start position:0%
the impression that these documents must
 
00:34:08.270 --> 00:34:08.280 align:start position:0%
be mailed daily even if this is a rule
 
00:34:10.790 --> 00:34:10.800 align:start position:0%
by the Secretary of State it is not
 
00:34:14.589 --> 00:34:14.599 align:start position:0%
being followed and even for example by
 
00:34:17.149 --> 00:34:17.159 align:start position:0%
mail especially today it is not very
 
00:34:20.190 --> 00:34:20.200 align:start position:0%
timely for example I filed the first day
 
00:34:22.710 --> 00:34:22.720 align:start position:0%
my town clerk mailed it that day picked
 
00:34:24.829 --> 00:34:24.839 align:start position:0%
up by the Postal Service the following
 
00:34:27.430 --> 00:34:27.440 align:start position:0%
Mo morning it was Monday before it
 
00:34:30.550 --> 00:34:30.560 align:start position:0%
showed up in the Secretary of State's
 
00:34:33.389 --> 00:34:33.399 align:start position:0%
report my town clerk thinks this is a
 
00:34:36.389 --> 00:34:36.399 align:start position:0%
very good idea and a comment was doesn't
 
00:34:39.389 --> 00:34:39.399 align:start position:0%
everybody have email all us you would
 
00:34:41.589 --> 00:34:41.599 align:start position:0%
like this to even go further and a lot
 
00:34:43.389 --> 00:34:43.399 align:start position:0%
of documents to be scanned and
 
00:34:46.510 --> 00:34:46.520 align:start position:0%
electronically sent up all of the
 
00:34:48.190 --> 00:34:48.200 align:start position:0%
candidates filed the Secretary of
 
00:34:51.069 --> 00:34:51.079 align:start position:0%
State's office except for state
 
00:34:52.909 --> 00:34:52.919 align:start position:0%
representative and their filings
 
00:34:55.750 --> 00:34:55.760 align:start position:0%
appeared that day on the Secretary of
 
00:34:58.589 --> 00:34:58.599 align:start position:0%
State's database why should our office
 
00:35:02.030 --> 00:35:02.040 align:start position:0%
of State Rep be second rate to other
 
00:35:04.390 --> 00:35:04.400 align:start position:0%
offices and how much time will this take
 
00:35:08.230 --> 00:35:08.240 align:start position:0%
by the town clerk 30 seconds the $2 fee
 
00:35:10.349 --> 00:35:10.359 align:start position:0%
will easy pay for any extra time they
 
00:35:12.470 --> 00:35:12.480 align:start position:0%
use and in the towns that this is
 
00:35:14.910 --> 00:35:14.920 align:start position:0%
happening in there are only a couple of
 
00:35:17.230 --> 00:35:17.240 align:start position:0%
candidates and also from talking some
 
00:35:18.870 --> 00:35:18.880 align:start position:0%
years ago to the Secretary of State's
 
00:35:21.270 --> 00:35:21.280 align:start position:0%
office some Town clerks have forgotten
 
00:35:24.150 --> 00:35:24.160 align:start position:0%
to send the documents in this will make
 
00:35:25.990 --> 00:35:26.000 align:start position:0%
it easy for the Secretary of State to
 
00:35:28.390 --> 00:35:28.400 align:start position:0%
follow up on paperwork and
 
00:35:30.630 --> 00:35:30.640 align:start position:0%

telling the the town clerks to mail in
 
00:36:13.390 --> 00:36:13.400 align:start position:0%

representative um there actually is a
 
00:37:41.630 --> 00:37:41.640 align:start position:0%
state law currently it's RSA 655 colon
 
00:37:44.309 --> 00:37:44.319 align:start position:0%
18 which states that each city or town
 
00:37:46.550 --> 00:37:46.560 align:start position:0%
clerk shall forward each Declaration of
 
00:37:48.950 --> 00:37:48.960 align:start position:0%
candidacy filed with him or her to the
 
00:37:50.829 --> 00:37:50.839 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State on the day of filing
 
00:37:53.790 --> 00:37:53.800 align:start position:0%
of the same uh rather than introduce a
 
00:37:56.670 --> 00:37:56.680 align:start position:0%
whole new section uh could we just modif
 
00:37:58.790 --> 00:37:58.800 align:start position:0%
ify the existing law and say that they
 
00:38:01.430 --> 00:38:01.440 align:start position:0%
shall submit that to the Secretary of
 
00:38:02.790 --> 00:38:02.800 align:start position:0%

00:38:25.510 --> 00:38:25.520 align:start position:0%

and follow up with the paperwork this is
 
00:38:32.710 --> 00:38:32.720 align:start position:0%

that also includes by facts if a town or
 
00:38:47.550 --> 00:38:47.560 align:start position:0%
city clerk chose to do it that way
 
00:38:50.430 --> 00:38:50.440 align:start position:0%
rather than by email sure I mean that's
 
00:38:52.589 --> 00:38:52.599 align:start position:0%
what whatever this that's why I left it
 
00:38:54.950 --> 00:38:54.960 align:start position:0%
open for whatever the Secretary State
 
00:38:57.109 --> 00:38:57.119 align:start position:0%

00:39:09.670 --> 00:39:09.680 align:start position:0%
further questions from anybody here in
 
00:39:19.790 --> 00:39:19.800 align:start position:0%

morning

00:39:25.430 --> 00:39:25.440 align:start position:0%
morning
 
00:39:28.670 --> 00:39:28.680 align:start position:0%
yes thank you I hear you thank you thank
 
00:39:31.109 --> 00:39:31.119 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question my thought is
 
00:39:33.230 --> 00:39:33.240 align:start position:0%
um say for example there are no filings
 
00:39:35.950 --> 00:39:35.960 align:start position:0%
on a particular day uh does the town
 
00:39:38.910 --> 00:39:38.920 align:start position:0%
clerk is he or she required to take any
 
00:39:41.589 --> 00:39:41.599 align:start position:0%
action and is the law clear on that
 
00:39:43.230 --> 00:39:43.240 align:start position:0%
point or does it need to be clear on
 
00:39:45.150 --> 00:39:45.160 align:start position:0%
that point no I don't think it need to
 
00:39:47.069 --> 00:39:47.079 align:start position:0%
be clear I mean people that file it
 
00:39:49.390 --> 00:39:49.400 align:start position:0%
should be a file a daily filing I if
 
00:39:52.030 --> 00:39:52.040 align:start position:0%
nobody files then you know in some cases
 
00:39:54.349 --> 00:39:54.359 align:start position:0%
where towns only have like in litfield
 
00:39:56.589 --> 00:39:56.599 align:start position:0%
there's only two people four people the
 
00:39:59.550 --> 00:39:59.560 align:start position:0%
most are going to file yeah so it's not
 
00:40:01.950 --> 00:40:01.960 align:start position:0%
going to be a daily filing and also I
 
00:40:03.630 --> 00:40:03.640 align:start position:0%
see represent Mooney you and I are both
 
00:40:07.150 --> 00:40:07.160 align:start position:0%

00:40:11.319 --> 00:40:13.030 align:start position:0%

so without the word
 
00:40:23.230 --> 00:40:23.240 align:start position:0%
electronic in this wording here of of
 
00:40:23.240 --> 00:40:24.230 align:start position:0%
electronic in this wording here of of
the

00:40:24.230 --> 00:40:24.240 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:40:27.470 --> 00:40:27.480 align:start position:0%
bill does that mean that a clerk could
 
00:40:29.950 --> 00:40:29.960 align:start position:0%
interpret this to me just mail it as is
 
00:40:33.309 --> 00:40:33.319 align:start position:0%
done now which you find to be somewhat
 
00:40:37.109 --> 00:40:37.119 align:start position:0%
slow in some cases so electronic is not
 
00:40:39.550 --> 00:40:39.560 align:start position:0%
in there they could mail it they could
 
00:40:41.829 --> 00:40:41.839 align:start position:0%
they could phone it in they could carry
 
00:40:43.030 --> 00:40:43.040 align:start position:0%
a pigeon it
 
00:40:46.829 --> 00:40:46.839 align:start position:0%

00:40:59.030 --> 00:40:59.040 align:start position:0%
electronically and I noticed that but
 
00:41:04.430 --> 00:41:04.440 align:start position:0%
the the bill itself on line five states
 
00:41:10.030 --> 00:41:10.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:12.390 --> 00:41:12.400 align:start position:0%

00:41:14.160 --> 00:41:15.710 align:start position:0%
representative for being here with us

00:41:15.710 --> 00:41:15.720 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:41:19.829 --> 00:41:19.839 align:start position:0%
morning I Al no one else has signed up
 
00:41:23.710 --> 00:41:23.720 align:start position:0%
to speak on this bill I do have a Mr
 
00:41:26.309 --> 00:41:26.319 align:start position:0%
Healey who has his hand raised and the
 
00:41:29.309 --> 00:41:29.319 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State um I'm going to
 
00:41:33.950 --> 00:41:33.960 align:start position:0%
promote repres Mr Healey uh to join us
 
00:41:36.470 --> 00:41:36.480 align:start position:0%
with a comment on
 
00:41:41.109 --> 00:41:41.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:44.710 --> 00:41:44.720 align:start position:0%
Healey hi uh Daniel hilly Derry town
 
00:41:48.349 --> 00:41:48.359 align:start position:0%
clerk um I've talked to a few Town
 
00:41:52.470 --> 00:41:52.480 align:start position:0%
clerks uh we all seem to like this bill
 
00:41:54.069 --> 00:41:54.079 align:start position:0%
I think it's a good idea to send the
 
00:41:57.230 --> 00:41:57.240 align:start position:0%
electronic uh filings daily
 
00:41:59.349 --> 00:41:59.359 align:start position:0%
um I know right now my office does
 
00:42:01.190 --> 00:42:01.200 align:start position:0%
forward everything up to the Secretary
 
00:42:03.950 --> 00:42:03.960 align:start position:0%
of State on a daily basis but mail can
 
00:42:07.230 --> 00:42:07.240 align:start position:0%
take a few days and I hate seeing um you
 
00:42:08.589 --> 00:42:08.599 align:start position:0%
know when the filing perod ends on a
 
00:42:10.829 --> 00:42:10.839 align:start position:0%
Friday that on a Wednesday or a Thursday
 
00:42:12.510 --> 00:42:12.520 align:start position:0%
the next week names are added to the
 
00:42:14.630 --> 00:42:14.640 align:start position:0%
list I think the Secretary of State
 
00:42:16.790 --> 00:42:16.800 align:start position:0%
really should have all the the names of
 
00:42:20.069 --> 00:42:20.079 align:start position:0%
the people on the you know the deadline
 
00:42:22.270 --> 00:42:22.280 align:start position:0%
at 5:00 pm and know who has signed up
 
00:42:24.030 --> 00:42:24.040 align:start position:0%
and know what to be expecting in the
 
00:42:27.790 --> 00:42:27.800 align:start position:0%
mail um and I thank uh representative
 
00:42:31.390 --> 00:42:31.400 align:start position:0%
berson for for stating that RSA um if
 
00:42:33.069 --> 00:42:33.079 align:start position:0%
clerks aren't doing that aren't
 
00:42:35.510 --> 00:42:35.520 align:start position:0%
following that I think the Secretary of
 
00:42:37.309 --> 00:42:37.319 align:start position:0%
State should be following up with them
 
00:42:39.829 --> 00:42:39.839 align:start position:0%
um if they're not sending it daily um
 
00:42:41.309 --> 00:42:41.319 align:start position:0%
but that is something that our office
 
00:42:43.510 --> 00:42:43.520 align:start position:0%
does uh I know many clerks all the
 
00:42:45.750 --> 00:42:45.760 align:start position:0%
clerks that I talk to have been been
 
00:42:47.950 --> 00:42:47.960 align:start position:0%
following that but I do think the
 
00:42:51.069 --> 00:42:51.079 align:start position:0%
electronic uh filing is is a good
 
00:42:54.829 --> 00:42:54.839 align:start position:0%
idea um I also do think that on a day if
 
00:42:57.549 --> 00:42:57.559 align:start position:0%
there are no filings that the town clerk
 
00:42:59.990 --> 00:43:00.000 align:start position:0%
should send something up saying uh the
 
00:43:02.270 --> 00:43:02.280 align:start position:0%
date and not we have no filings for this
 
00:43:05.910 --> 00:43:05.920 align:start position:0%
date to report uh it just kind of
 
00:43:09.109 --> 00:43:09.119 align:start position:0%
reinforces um the transparency with when
 
00:43:12.750 --> 00:43:12.760 align:start position:0%
when people file but um I would be in
 
00:43:14.750 --> 00:43:14.760 align:start position:0%
support of of this
 
00:43:17.549 --> 00:43:17.559 align:start position:0%

Zoom meetings this summer for the safe

elections committee that what was the
 
00:43:59.950 --> 00:43:59.960 align:start position:0%

Deputy well thank you madam chair I'm
 
00:44:11.230 --> 00:44:11.240 align:start position:0%
here um I'm David scanland deputy
 
00:44:13.790 --> 00:44:13.800 align:start position:0%
secretary of state and you know I would
 
00:44:15.589 --> 00:44:15.599 align:start position:0%
like to say that you know we I think we
 
00:44:18.670 --> 00:44:18.680 align:start position:0%
would be happy to receive information on
 
00:44:21.630 --> 00:44:21.640 align:start position:0%
who has filed for state representative
 
00:44:24.109 --> 00:44:24.119 align:start position:0%
or delegate to the Republican convention
 
00:44:26.950 --> 00:44:26.960 align:start position:0%
uh from the town Clerks the day of those
 
00:44:30.069 --> 00:44:30.079 align:start position:0%
filings um I would like to say that that
 
00:44:32.870 --> 00:44:32.880 align:start position:0%
most Town clerks have been getting that
 
00:44:35.990 --> 00:44:36.000 align:start position:0%
information uh to us in the mail on the
 
00:44:37.990 --> 00:44:38.000 align:start position:0%
day of the filing so there have been a
 
00:44:40.390 --> 00:44:40.400 align:start position:0%
few instances where uh some of the
 
00:44:43.910 --> 00:44:43.920 align:start position:0%
clerks have batched them and sent them
 
00:44:46.190 --> 00:44:46.200 align:start position:0%
uh every three or four days or you know
 
00:44:49.510 --> 00:44:49.520 align:start position:0%
even at the end of the uh filing
 
00:44:51.829 --> 00:44:51.839 align:start position:0%
period and there have been some
 
00:44:55.549 --> 00:44:55.559 align:start position:0%
instances where filings have got or you
 
00:44:58.270 --> 00:44:58.280 align:start position:0%
know dro behind a desk and not found for
 
00:45:00.990 --> 00:45:01.000 align:start position:0%
some time after the fact and those
 
00:45:04.589 --> 00:45:04.599 align:start position:0%
situations do cause problems um just a
 
00:45:06.510 --> 00:45:06.520 align:start position:0%
couple things I'd like to mention is
 
00:45:09.309 --> 00:45:09.319 align:start position:0%
that not not every clerk's office is
 
00:45:12.190 --> 00:45:12.200 align:start position:0%
open every day uh during the filing
 
00:45:14.630 --> 00:45:14.640 align:start position:0%
period and I'm sure in a large town like
 
00:45:17.030 --> 00:45:17.040 align:start position:0%
Derry um you know they meet their
 
00:45:20.109 --> 00:45:20.119 align:start position:0%
offices open every day uh for normal
 
00:45:22.190 --> 00:45:22.200 align:start position:0%
business hours but when you get up into
 
00:45:24.950 --> 00:45:24.960 align:start position:0%
the North Country there are Clerk's
 
00:45:27.510 --> 00:45:27.520 align:start position:0%
offices that may be open a couple of
 
00:45:30.309 --> 00:45:30.319 align:start position:0%
days a week and and not even for a full
 
00:45:33.950 --> 00:45:33.960 align:start position:0%
day so um you know I think we have to
 
00:45:36.950 --> 00:45:36.960 align:start position:0%
recognize uh that the hours aren't
 
00:45:39.950 --> 00:45:39.960 align:start position:0%
consistent um and in terms of receiving
 
00:45:41.390 --> 00:45:41.400 align:start position:0%
the information
 
00:45:43.510 --> 00:45:43.520 align:start position:0%
electronically uh we may have to think
 
00:45:46.829 --> 00:45:46.839 align:start position:0%
about how that process would work and
 
00:45:48.990 --> 00:45:49.000 align:start position:0%
and uh you know maybe change it a little
 
00:45:52.230 --> 00:45:52.240 align:start position:0%
bit over time uh it's important for us
 
00:45:55.950 --> 00:45:55.960 align:start position:0%
to receive the hard copy the signed de
 
00:45:58.950 --> 00:45:58.960 align:start position:0%
aration of candidacy uh we review it in
 
00:46:00.470 --> 00:46:00.480 align:start position:0%
this office to make sure that the
 
00:46:02.950 --> 00:46:02.960 align:start position:0%
information is correct uh and the
 
00:46:05.710 --> 00:46:05.720 align:start position:0%
candidate is actually qualified to run
 
00:46:07.950 --> 00:46:07.960 align:start position:0%
for the office and occasionally there
 
00:46:09.829 --> 00:46:09.839 align:start position:0%
are a few that you know that slip by
 
00:46:13.710 --> 00:46:13.720 align:start position:0%
that scrutiny but um you know we don't
 
00:46:16.670 --> 00:46:16.680 align:start position:0%
we don't necessarily uh have that
 
00:46:18.829 --> 00:46:18.839 align:start position:0%
information until we receive the signed
 
00:46:21.670 --> 00:46:21.680 align:start position:0%
declaration so what we receive
 
00:46:23.470 --> 00:46:23.480 align:start position:0%
electronically at least to start could
 
00:46:26.270 --> 00:46:26.280 align:start position:0%
be posted as an unofficial list of
 
00:46:29.069 --> 00:46:29.079 align:start position:0%
filings and then once we receive the
 
00:46:30.349 --> 00:46:30.359 align:start position:0%
actual sign
 
00:46:34.030 --> 00:46:34.040 align:start position:0%
declarations uh we can change that uh to
 
00:46:35.510 --> 00:46:35.520 align:start position:0%
an official
 
00:46:38.510 --> 00:46:38.520 align:start position:0%
list um but again I just I want to re
 
00:46:41.790 --> 00:46:41.800 align:start position:0%
reiterate that most clerks uh in New
 
00:46:44.829 --> 00:46:44.839 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh do their job very well and
 
00:46:48.710 --> 00:46:48.720 align:start position:0%
they get these filings uh uh in the mail
 
00:46:50.829 --> 00:46:50.839 align:start position:0%
as required by the statute on the day
 
00:46:52.510 --> 00:46:52.520 align:start position:0%
that they're filed and they're just a
 
00:46:56.030 --> 00:46:56.040 align:start position:0%
few rare instances where uh uh you know
 
00:46:58.150 --> 00:46:58.160 align:start position:0%
some of the clerks don't uh actually
 
00:47:01.030 --> 00:47:01.040 align:start position:0%
follow that process and bat them or send
 
00:47:02.910 --> 00:47:02.920 align:start position:0%
them to us on the last day and when
 
00:47:05.109 --> 00:47:05.119 align:start position:0%
those happen we do follow up so with
 
00:47:06.870 --> 00:47:06.880 align:start position:0%
that I'd be happy to answer any
 
00:47:09.390 --> 00:47:09.400 align:start position:0%
questions question for Deputy scan for
 
00:47:11.670 --> 00:47:11.680 align:start position:0%

00:47:11.680 --> 00:47:13.190 align:start position:0%

00:47:17.150 --> 00:47:17.160 align:start position:0%
scan would a scan copy of the sign
 
00:47:19.470 --> 00:47:19.480 align:start position:0%
declaration be adequate for you to make
 
00:47:22.430 --> 00:47:22.440 align:start position:0%
an official uh
 
00:47:25.109 --> 00:47:25.119 align:start position:0%
review report official that was sent in
 
00:47:27.510 --> 00:47:27.520 align:start position:0%

285 how many dead people are still on
 
00:59:03.990 --> 00:59:04.000 align:start position:0%
the checklist in your town the dairy
 
00:59:05.750 --> 00:59:05.760 align:start position:0%
supervisors of the checklist removed
 
00:59:07.510 --> 00:59:07.520 align:start position:0%
over 40 dead voters this fall that
 
00:59:09.750 --> 00:59:09.760 align:start position:0%
weren't caught by the current system how
 
00:59:11.109 --> 00:59:11.119 align:start position:0%
many slipped through the cracks in your
 
00:59:13.510 --> 00:59:13.520 align:start position:0%
town or city and over the whole state
 
00:59:15.029 --> 00:59:15.039 align:start position:0%
this isn't because of lack of effort
 
00:59:17.029 --> 00:59:17.039 align:start position:0%
from our supervisors but there's a
 
00:59:18.829 --> 00:59:18.839 align:start position:0%
culture of following the minimum prescri
 
00:59:20.670 --> 00:59:20.680 align:start position:0%
prescription of the law so as not to
 
00:59:22.870 --> 00:59:22.880 align:start position:0%
disenfranchise anybody and I understand
 
00:59:24.870 --> 00:59:24.880 align:start position:0%
why they do that but these good
 
00:59:27.390 --> 00:59:27.400 align:start position:0%
intentions lead to a bloated checklist
 
00:59:29.510 --> 00:59:29.520 align:start position:0%
one with costs both in dollar figures
 
00:59:32.549 --> 00:59:32.559 align:start position:0%
and in the right to cast one whole vote
 
00:59:35.029 --> 00:59:35.039 align:start position:0%
HB 285 will step up that minimum
 
00:59:37.230 --> 00:59:37.240 align:start position:0%
standard bringing it in line with towns
 
00:59:39.470 --> 00:59:39.480 align:start position:0%
like London which take a more proactive
 
00:59:41.230 --> 00:59:41.240 align:start position:0%
approach and actively use the
 
00:59:41.240 --> 00:59:42.589 align:start position:0%
approach and actively use the
notification

00:59:42.589 --> 00:59:42.599 align:start position:0%
notification
 
00:59:45.309 --> 00:59:45.319 align:start position:0%
system voter disenfranchisement is a
 
00:59:47.789 --> 00:59:47.799 align:start position:0%
serious issue our checklist protects the
 
00:59:49.589 --> 00:59:49.599 align:start position:0%
right of each inhabitant in the state to
 
00:59:51.549 --> 00:59:51.559 align:start position:0%
have an equal right to vote in any
 
00:59:53.549 --> 00:59:53.559 align:start position:0%
election which is spelled out in the New
 
00:59:57.230 --> 00:59:57.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Constitution article 11 part 1
 
00:59:59.549 --> 00:59:59.559 align:start position:0%
allowing duplicate or out ofd names on
 
01:00:01.549 --> 01:00:01.559 align:start position:0%
the checklist violates this right
 
01:00:03.349 --> 01:00:03.359 align:start position:0%
because this dilutes the equality of
 
01:00:06.349 --> 01:00:06.359 align:start position:0%
each valid Vote many towns and cities
 
01:00:08.029 --> 01:00:08.039 align:start position:0%
follow the minimum requirements
 
01:00:09.910 --> 01:00:09.920 align:start position:0%
concerned about the risk of potentially
 
01:00:12.390 --> 01:00:12.400 align:start position:0%
moving a valid voter that is
 
01:00:14.109 --> 01:00:14.119 align:start position:0%
understandable but it misses a larger
 
01:00:16.910 --> 01:00:16.920 align:start position:0%
Point leaving invalid voters on the
 
01:00:18.990 --> 01:00:19.000 align:start position:0%
checklist means that there's a honey pot
 
01:00:21.549 --> 01:00:21.559 align:start position:0%
for dishonest people and if this leads
 
01:00:23.309 --> 01:00:23.319 align:start position:0%
to fraud it will deny equal
 
01:00:24.990 --> 01:00:25.000 align:start position:0%
representation to the quality ified
 
01:00:27.309 --> 01:00:27.319 align:start position:0%
voters this too is
 
01:00:30.190 --> 01:00:30.200 align:start position:0%
disenfranchisement HB 285 provides the
 
01:00:31.990 --> 01:00:32.000 align:start position:0%
checks needed to protect this sacred
 
01:00:34.589 --> 01:00:34.599 align:start position:0%
right for each voter to cast one whole
 
01:00:36.950 --> 01:00:36.960 align:start position:0%
vote as you look through this bill the
 
01:00:38.470 --> 01:00:38.480 align:start position:0%
cost of annually running the list
 
01:00:39.990 --> 01:00:40.000 align:start position:0%
through the national change of address
 
01:00:42.349 --> 01:00:42.359 align:start position:0%
system will come to mind I'm sure the
 
01:00:45.029 --> 01:00:45.039 align:start position:0%
cost of more mailings will too I believe
 
01:00:47.150 --> 01:00:47.160 align:start position:0%
that we can and should invest in free
 
01:00:49.630 --> 01:00:49.640 align:start position:0%
and fair elections however I believe
 
01:00:51.510 --> 01:00:51.520 align:start position:0%
that fixing our bloated checklist will
 
01:00:54.510 --> 01:00:54.520 align:start position:0%
save money too as you're well aware many
 
01:00:56.029 --> 01:00:56.039 align:start position:0%
voting procedures like the count of
 
01:00:58.309 --> 01:00:58.319 align:start position:0%
voting booths is prescribed based upon
 
01:01:00.750 --> 01:01:00.760 align:start position:0%
the number of Voters on the checklist
 
01:01:02.549 --> 01:01:02.559 align:start position:0%
the 4,000 residents flagged as
 
01:01:04.029 --> 01:01:04.039 align:start position:0%
permanently moved from dairy and my
 
01:01:06.870 --> 01:01:06.880 align:start position:0%
check of 24,000 names on the checklist
 
01:01:09.549 --> 01:01:09.559 align:start position:0%
represents one six of the list that's a
 
01:01:11.589 --> 01:01:11.599 align:start position:0%
lot of extra capacity at elections which
 
01:01:14.150 --> 01:01:14.160 align:start position:0%
comes at a real cost we do catch those
 
01:01:16.549 --> 01:01:16.559 align:start position:0%
voters on the 10-year clean but that's a
 
01:01:20.710 --> 01:01:20.720 align:start position:0%
safety valve and not a solution HB 285
 
01:01:23.029 --> 01:01:23.039 align:start position:0%
presents a solution to drive ongoing
 
01:01:25.069 --> 01:01:25.079 align:start position:0%
maintenance of the checklist add
 
01:01:27.150 --> 01:01:27.160 align:start position:0%
standardization of addresses which is
 
01:01:29.430 --> 01:01:29.440 align:start position:0%
needed and to check the list annually
 
01:01:32.870 --> 01:01:32.880 align:start position:0%
for permanent moves the cost of HB 285
 
01:01:35.630 --> 01:01:35.640 align:start position:0%
should be neutral but the cost of not
 
01:01:38.829 --> 01:01:38.839 align:start position:0%
passing HB 285 could mean that your vote
 
01:01:41.870 --> 01:01:41.880 align:start position:0%
counts as only 56 of a vote I urge you
 
01:01:43.950 --> 01:01:43.960 align:start position:0%
to vote op to pass and I'm available to
 
01:01:43.960 --> 01:01:45.349 align:start position:0%

01:02:11.710 --> 01:02:11.720 align:start position:0%
they feel about this the town clerks
 
01:02:13.109 --> 01:02:13.119 align:start position:0%
Association or anything like that have
 
01:02:15.430 --> 01:02:15.440 align:start position:0%
you have you worked with them on
 
01:02:17.670 --> 01:02:17.680 align:start position:0%
this um thank you very much for the
 
01:02:20.750 --> 01:02:20.760 align:start position:0%
question representative PR of O'Brien I
 
01:02:22.390 --> 01:02:22.400 align:start position:0%
as I was working through the checklist
 
01:02:24.750 --> 01:02:24.760 align:start position:0%
this summer and identified some of these
 
01:02:26.390 --> 01:02:26.400 align:start position:0%
some of these voters that should have
 
01:02:28.269 --> 01:02:28.279 align:start position:0%
come off the list I worked closely with
 
01:02:30.710 --> 01:02:30.720 align:start position:0%
our town clerk Our Town mod moderator
 
01:02:33.069 --> 01:02:33.079 align:start position:0%
and supervisor of the checklist um these
 
01:02:34.549 --> 01:02:34.559 align:start position:0%
are things that are normally caught at
 
01:02:37.390 --> 01:02:37.400 align:start position:0%
the 10-year Purge and it's something
 
01:02:39.349 --> 01:02:39.359 align:start position:0%
that is a lot harder for them to follow
 
01:02:41.390 --> 01:02:41.400 align:start position:0%
they appreciated my efforts and they saw
 
01:02:44.190 --> 01:02:44.200 align:start position:0%
these opportunities for improvement and
 
01:02:46.470 --> 01:02:46.480 align:start position:0%
they shared my excitement about the
 
01:02:48.990 --> 01:02:49.000 align:start position:0%
ability to improve this process in a way
 
01:02:51.750 --> 01:02:51.760 align:start position:0%
that would not be overly burdensome and
 
01:02:54.549 --> 01:02:54.559 align:start position:0%
would incre would um would improve these
 
01:02:56.109 --> 01:02:56.119 align:start position:0%
check list and improve the
 
01:03:00.549 --> 01:03:00.559 align:start position:0%
Integrity thank you thank you thank you
 
01:03:03.510 --> 01:03:03.520 align:start position:0%
questions from Members attending
 
01:03:06.109 --> 01:03:06.119 align:start position:0%
electronically representative
 
01:03:09.349 --> 01:03:09.359 align:start position:0%
Lane yes thank you madam chair um
 
01:03:11.269 --> 01:03:11.279 align:start position:0%
representative I notice that there's a
 
01:03:15.190 --> 01:03:15.200 align:start position:0%
provision that you it's to be sent into
 
01:03:18.430 --> 01:03:18.440 align:start position:0%
the DMV well the DMV has a a task under
 
01:03:20.829 --> 01:03:20.839 align:start position:0%
this bill have you talked to them and
 
01:03:22.549 --> 01:03:22.559 align:start position:0%
are they okay with that
 
01:03:27.589 --> 01:03:27.599 align:start position:0%
because um my experience is sometimes
 
01:03:29.789 --> 01:03:29.799 align:start position:0%
otherwise um thank you very much for the
 
01:03:31.950 --> 01:03:31.960 align:start position:0%
question representative I actually did
 
01:03:35.109 --> 01:03:35.119 align:start position:0%
not talk to the DMV about this um I I
 
01:03:37.069 --> 01:03:37.079 align:start position:0%
apologize for that oversight but this is
 
01:03:38.630 --> 01:03:38.640 align:start position:0%
something where it is important to be
 
01:03:40.589 --> 01:03:40.599 align:start position:0%
able to get those change of address in
 
01:03:42.910 --> 01:03:42.920 align:start position:0%
my discussions with the moderator and
 
01:03:45.309 --> 01:03:45.319 align:start position:0%
with other people there already is an
 
01:03:47.150 --> 01:03:47.160 align:start position:0%
ongoing back and forth but it hasn't
 
01:03:49.390 --> 01:03:49.400 align:start position:0%
been codified and so it's something
 
01:03:51.190 --> 01:03:51.200 align:start position:0%
where the data is sometimes passed back
 
01:03:53.269 --> 01:03:53.279 align:start position:0%
and forth but this the information does
 
01:03:55.309 --> 01:03:55.319 align:start position:0%
not always get transmitted back and
 
01:03:57.470 --> 01:03:57.480 align:start position:0%
forth so I believe that this would be a
 
01:03:59.470 --> 01:03:59.480 align:start position:0%
good step for
 
01:04:02.750 --> 01:04:02.760 align:start position:0%
clarification thank you representative I
 
01:04:05.670 --> 01:04:05.680 align:start position:0%
see you have your hand up but you're on
 
01:04:08.670 --> 01:04:08.680 align:start position:0%
the phone so I think you have to hit
 
01:04:12.950 --> 01:04:12.960 align:start position:0%
star six anybody star six or Star n
 
01:04:12.960 --> 01:04:13.789 align:start position:0%
star six anybody star six or Star n
thank

01:04:13.789 --> 01:04:13.799 align:start position:0%
thank
 
01:04:17.750 --> 01:04:17.760 align:start position:0%
you thank you madam
 
01:04:21.789 --> 01:04:21.799 align:start position:0%
chair um I uh just wondered uh I wanted
 
01:04:23.390 --> 01:04:23.400 align:start position:0%
to thank you representative for your
 
01:04:25.430 --> 01:04:25.440 align:start position:0%
testimony and I just wanted um to get a
 
01:04:26.950 --> 01:04:26.960 align:start position:0%
little clarification on the numbers and
 
01:04:29.269 --> 01:04:29.279 align:start position:0%
Barry you said there you discovered 40
 
01:04:30.990 --> 01:04:31.000 align:start position:0%
people who had recently passed away who
 
01:04:32.950 --> 01:04:32.960 align:start position:0%
are on the checklist and then also
 
01:04:35.269 --> 01:04:35.279 align:start position:0%
mentioned the number 4,000 and I'm
 
01:04:37.269 --> 01:04:37.279 align:start position:0%
guessing I'm sorry if I didn't follow
 
01:04:38.829 --> 01:04:38.839 align:start position:0%
you clearly enough but I'm guessing that
 
01:04:42.109 --> 01:04:42.119 align:start position:0%
you found something like um about 4,000
 
01:04:44.230 --> 01:04:44.240 align:start position:0%
people who had moved out of town and
 
01:04:46.510 --> 01:04:46.520 align:start position:0%
were still on the checklist is is that
 
01:04:48.510 --> 01:04:48.520 align:start position:0%
right thank you very much for the
 
01:04:50.829 --> 01:04:50.839 align:start position:0%
question representative yes I did
 
01:04:54.150 --> 01:04:54.160 align:start position:0%
identify I identified 100 potential vot
 
01:04:56.750 --> 01:04:56.760 align:start position:0%
voters who had passed away there were um
 
01:04:58.710 --> 01:04:58.720 align:start position:0%
several dozen that had been caught by
 
01:05:01.349 --> 01:05:01.359 align:start position:0%
this three-point check system right now
 
01:05:03.630 --> 01:05:03.640 align:start position:0%
death records when they match the voter
 
01:05:06.390 --> 01:05:06.400 align:start position:0%
name date of birth and the town of
 
01:05:08.470 --> 01:05:08.480 align:start position:0%
residence are transmitted automatically
 
01:05:10.150 --> 01:05:10.160 align:start position:0%
to the checklist and that's a
 
01:05:11.670 --> 01:05:11.680 align:start position:0%
three-point match when there's a
 
01:05:13.109 --> 01:05:13.119 align:start position:0%
two-point match because somebody has
 
01:05:14.870 --> 01:05:14.880 align:start position:0%
moved to a nursing home or another
 
01:05:16.990 --> 01:05:17.000 align:start position:0%
temporary facility or they die out of
 
01:05:19.190 --> 01:05:19.200 align:start position:0%
their Hometown it misses that
 
01:05:21.390 --> 01:05:21.400 align:start position:0%
three-point match and those two-point
 
01:05:23.430 --> 01:05:23.440 align:start position:0%
matches are a serious point of
 
01:05:25.910 --> 01:05:25.920 align:start position:0%
consideration especially es especially
 
01:05:28.349 --> 01:05:28.359 align:start position:0%
with nursing homes involved so those 42
 
01:05:30.029 --> 01:05:30.039 align:start position:0%
voters uh were followed up by the
 
01:05:32.109 --> 01:05:32.119 align:start position:0%
supervisor of the checklist they found
 
01:05:35.910 --> 01:05:35.920 align:start position:0%
death notices and the procedure in HB
 
01:05:39.029 --> 01:05:39.039 align:start position:0%
285 would would codify that and make it
 
01:05:41.230 --> 01:05:41.240 align:start position:0%
so that the towns would be notified
 
01:05:44.109 --> 01:05:44.119 align:start position:0%
about potential two-point matches and
 
01:05:45.829 --> 01:05:45.839 align:start position:0%
they could further investigate those in
 
01:05:48.430 --> 01:05:48.440 align:start position:0%
order to better clear the voter lists in
 
01:05:50.870 --> 01:05:50.880 align:start position:0%
dery the 4,000 voters who had moved we
 
01:05:52.670 --> 01:05:52.680 align:start position:0%
have some very very large apartment
 
01:05:54.829 --> 01:05:54.839 align:start position:0%
complexes and we do have a relatively
 
01:05:57.549 --> 01:05:57.559 align:start position:0%
High turnover rate in town these are
 
01:05:59.390 --> 01:05:59.400 align:start position:0%
voters that I'm not saying that they
 
01:06:01.430 --> 01:06:01.440 align:start position:0%
would have voted I'm just saying that
 
01:06:03.029 --> 01:06:03.039 align:start position:0%
right now the way that they're cleared
 
01:06:05.789 --> 01:06:05.799 align:start position:0%
off is on the 10-year Purge and we are
 
01:06:07.589 --> 01:06:07.599 align:start position:0%
getting ready to do that right after the
 
01:06:10.349 --> 01:06:10.359 align:start position:0%
Census Data this year in Derry this
 
01:06:12.109 --> 01:06:12.119 align:start position:0%
takes the better part of the year for
 
01:06:14.430 --> 01:06:14.440 align:start position:0%
them to do the 30-day notifications and
 
01:06:17.069 --> 01:06:17.079 align:start position:0%
to clear out people who have moved out
 
01:06:18.870 --> 01:06:18.880 align:start position:0%
of town and haven't voted in the in the
 
01:06:21.630 --> 01:06:21.640 align:start position:0%
previous elections this is a process
 
01:06:26.430 --> 01:06:26.440 align:start position:0%
that is slow Bur some and does leave a
 
01:06:28.309 --> 01:06:28.319 align:start position:0%
lot of residents who move out of towns
 
01:06:32.349 --> 01:06:32.359 align:start position:0%
as large and um and transient as dairy I
 
01:06:33.589 --> 01:06:33.599 align:start position:0%
I know that our town is doing a
 
01:06:35.150 --> 01:06:35.160 align:start position:0%
phenomenal job but I think that we can
 
01:06:37.549 --> 01:06:37.559 align:start position:0%
give them better tools through the rsas
 
01:06:40.630 --> 01:06:40.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:44.950 --> 01:06:44.960 align:start position:0%
285 thank you thank you thank you any
 
01:06:48.150 --> 01:06:48.160 align:start position:0%
other questions from committee members
 
01:06:48.160 --> 01:06:50.750 align:start position:0%
other questions from committee members
attending

01:06:50.750 --> 01:06:50.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:53.029 --> 01:06:53.039 align:start position:0%
electronically in the room
 
01:06:55.349 --> 01:06:55.359 align:start position:0%
representative it thank you madam chair
 
01:06:56.950 --> 01:06:56.960 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for taking my
 
01:06:59.549 --> 01:06:59.559 align:start position:0%
question in in the process of doing your
 
01:07:03.549 --> 01:07:03.559 align:start position:0%
research for this uh Bill have you seen
 
01:07:06.950 --> 01:07:06.960 align:start position:0%
any data that indicates for same day
 
01:07:08.750 --> 01:07:08.760 align:start position:0%
registrations particularly in a town
 
01:07:10.710 --> 01:07:10.720 align:start position:0%
like yours where you have a lot of
 
01:07:12.190 --> 01:07:12.200 align:start position:0%
apartment complexes where people come
 
01:07:15.029 --> 01:07:15.039 align:start position:0%
and go what percentage of those voters
 
01:07:18.990 --> 01:07:19.000 align:start position:0%
May uh have moved out of town say in in
 
01:07:21.829 --> 01:07:21.839 align:start position:0%
an election period or even on a yearly
 
01:07:24.029 --> 01:07:24.039 align:start position:0%
basis there any data that shows how many
 
01:07:27.150 --> 01:07:27.160 align:start position:0%
same day registrations are back on the
 
01:07:29.710 --> 01:07:29.720 align:start position:0%
list again in
 
01:07:31.950 --> 01:07:31.960 align:start position:0%
town uh thank you for your question
 
01:07:33.750 --> 01:07:33.760 align:start position:0%
representative and that is a very
 
01:07:36.029 --> 01:07:36.039 align:start position:0%
poignant question I don't have that
 
01:07:39.670 --> 01:07:39.680 align:start position:0%
information because um the the data by
 
01:07:42.109 --> 01:07:42.119 align:start position:0%
the time it came through um it was it
 
01:07:43.589 --> 01:07:43.599 align:start position:0%
was harder to correlate that and check
 
01:07:45.349 --> 01:07:45.359 align:start position:0%
that against those numbers that is
 
01:07:47.190 --> 01:07:47.200 align:start position:0%
something that I could look into if you
 
01:07:49.549 --> 01:07:49.559 align:start position:0%
will not be executing this soon I can
 
01:07:51.309 --> 01:07:51.319 align:start position:0%
get that information to the committee
 
01:07:52.549 --> 01:07:52.559 align:start position:0%
and also speaking to the previous
 
01:07:54.190 --> 01:07:54.200 align:start position:0%
Representatives comment I can get in
 
01:07:56.430 --> 01:07:56.440 align:start position:0%
touch with the DMP and see see what
 
01:07:57.990 --> 01:07:58.000 align:start position:0%
their opinion is and share that with you
 
01:08:00.670 --> 01:08:00.680 align:start position:0%
as well but I I are you worried
 
01:08:02.910 --> 01:08:02.920 align:start position:0%
representative toosan about people
 
01:08:04.269 --> 01:08:04.279 align:start position:0%
losing their vote because they're
 
01:08:06.109 --> 01:08:06.119 align:start position:0%
removed from the checklist and then
 
01:08:07.750 --> 01:08:07.760 align:start position:0%
coming back on because they moved to a
 
01:08:10.109 --> 01:08:10.119 align:start position:0%
different apartment in dairy or within a
 
01:08:12.750 --> 01:08:12.760 align:start position:0%
town or are you worri concerned more
 
01:08:15.430 --> 01:08:15.440 align:start position:0%
about um potential validity of those
 
01:08:18.229 --> 01:08:18.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:21.149 --> 01:08:21.159 align:start position:0%
voters it's the
 
01:08:25.189 --> 01:08:25.199 align:start position:0%
validity thank you thank you
 
01:08:27.470 --> 01:08:27.480 align:start position:0%
um I that that's not within the scope of
 
01:08:29.510 --> 01:08:29.520 align:start position:0%
this bill but it looks I from perusing
 
01:08:30.789 --> 01:08:30.799 align:start position:0%
the bills that you have in front of you
 
01:08:31.870 --> 01:08:31.880 align:start position:0%
I think that there are already some
 
01:08:33.550 --> 01:08:33.560 align:start position:0%
wonderful bills to address that to your
 
01:08:37.229 --> 01:08:37.239 align:start position:0%
committee thank you thank you any other
 
01:08:38.910 --> 01:08:38.920 align:start position:0%

and

01:09:09.630 --> 01:09:09.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:13.070 --> 01:09:13.080 align:start position:0%

01:09:32.110 --> 01:09:32.120 align:start position:0%
Ms Robinson um but I did want to just uh
 
01:09:35.870 --> 01:09:35.880 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for seeing me and um
 
01:09:37.749 --> 01:09:37.759 align:start position:0%
hearing to hearing my comments today
 
01:09:41.550 --> 01:09:41.560 align:start position:0%
excuse me I'm trying to get rid of that
 
01:09:44.430 --> 01:09:44.440 align:start position:0%
there we go much better thank you thank
 
01:09:46.870 --> 01:09:46.880 align:start position:0%
you sorry
 
01:09:52.309 --> 01:09:52.319 align:start position:0%
um I am uh pleased with the bill itself
 
01:09:55.110 --> 01:09:55.120 align:start position:0%
as far as it goes I think that every
 
01:09:57.350 --> 01:09:57.360 align:start position:0%
every one of the Town clerks would agree
 
01:09:59.189 --> 01:09:59.199 align:start position:0%
that we want to have the best
 
01:10:01.070 --> 01:10:01.080 align:start position:0%
information possible as long as it
 
01:10:03.709 --> 01:10:03.719 align:start position:0%
doesn't put a huge boatload of work on
 
01:10:07.270 --> 01:10:07.280 align:start position:0%
them however I would like to say uh to
 
01:10:09.709 --> 01:10:09.719 align:start position:0%
request consideration of two additional
 
01:10:16.550 --> 01:10:16.560 align:start position:0%
things one is that um in section four uh
 
01:10:19.510 --> 01:10:19.520 align:start position:0%
1A there's a mention of what the voter
 
01:10:21.310 --> 01:10:21.320 align:start position:0%
database would
 
01:10:24.709 --> 01:10:24.719 align:start position:0%
include and right now the voter database
 
01:10:30.590 --> 01:10:30.600 align:start position:0%
as accessible does not include date of
 
01:10:33.189 --> 01:10:33.199 align:start position:0%
registration and that information would
 
01:10:35.669 --> 01:10:35.679 align:start position:0%
be very helpful there's always an
 
01:10:38.870 --> 01:10:38.880 align:start position:0%
interest from candidates as well as from
 
01:10:41.070 --> 01:10:41.080 align:start position:0%
organizations and making sure that new
 
01:10:44.750 --> 01:10:44.760 align:start position:0%
voters are familiar with if they come
 
01:10:48.110 --> 01:10:48.120 align:start position:0%
from out of state with how New Hampshire
 
01:10:51.669 --> 01:10:51.679 align:start position:0%
uh election laws work and how our
 
01:10:53.790 --> 01:10:53.800 align:start position:0%
government works and it would be very
 
01:10:56.189 --> 01:10:56.199 align:start position:0%
helpful to know that right now it's a
 
01:11:00.350 --> 01:11:00.360 align:start position:0%
very conversome uh hand process to be
 
01:11:02.950 --> 01:11:02.960 align:start position:0%
able to find that out and including that
 
01:11:04.430 --> 01:11:04.440 align:start position:0%
date would be very
 
01:11:06.950 --> 01:11:06.960 align:start position:0%
helpful the other piece I would
 
01:11:11.149 --> 01:11:11.159 align:start position:0%
encourage is uh I suspect there's always
 
01:11:14.510 --> 01:11:14.520 align:start position:0%
an interest in making sure that voting
 
01:11:16.750 --> 01:11:16.760 align:start position:0%
information follows the
 
01:11:19.470 --> 01:11:19.480 align:start position:0%
voter however it's rare that that
 
01:11:22.550 --> 01:11:22.560 align:start position:0%
actually happens so for example my
 
01:11:25.709 --> 01:11:25.719 align:start position:0%
husband and I live lived in conquer for
 
01:11:28.390 --> 01:11:28.400 align:start position:0%
a couple of years and voted there we now
 
01:11:29.310 --> 01:11:29.320 align:start position:0%
live in
 
01:11:32.950 --> 01:11:32.960 align:start position:0%
Grantham um all of our voter
 
01:11:32.960 --> 01:11:34.790 align:start position:0%
Grantham um all of our voter
information

01:11:34.790 --> 01:11:34.800 align:start position:0%
information
 
01:11:37.990 --> 01:11:38.000 align:start position:0%
disappeared uh when we
 
01:11:40.590 --> 01:11:40.600 align:start position:0%
re-registered in uh
 
01:11:43.990 --> 01:11:44.000 align:start position:0%
Grantham so it would be very helpful if
 
01:11:47.189 --> 01:11:47.199 align:start position:0%
uh more attention could be paid to when
 
01:11:50.189 --> 01:11:50.199 align:start position:0%
somebody has moved within the state that
 
01:11:51.830 --> 01:11:51.840 align:start position:0%
that information on how they've been
 
01:11:56.390 --> 01:11:56.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:58.590 --> 01:11:58.600 align:start position:0%
available thank you for the opportunity
 
01:12:00.149 --> 01:12:00.159 align:start position:0%

hb25 as you know I a co-sponsor to the
 
01:13:15.990 --> 01:13:16.000 align:start position:0%
record my name is dou
 
01:13:18.750 --> 01:13:18.760 align:start position:0%
represent and also Vice chair the
 
01:13:24.189 --> 01:13:24.199 align:start position:0%
science technology comme on speak uh
 
01:13:25.910 --> 01:13:25.920 align:start position:0%
it's my strong belief that having an
 
01:13:27.669 --> 01:13:27.679 align:start position:0%
accurate B registration list is
 
01:13:29.149 --> 01:13:29.159 align:start position:0%
necessary and
 
01:13:32.229 --> 01:13:32.239 align:start position:0%
critical uh to ensure in confidence with
 
01:13:34.030 --> 01:13:34.040 align:start position:0%
the voting public that only those who
 
01:13:36.430 --> 01:13:36.440 align:start position:0%
can legally vote in our state in federal
 
01:13:37.870 --> 01:13:37.880 align:start position:0%
elections do
 
01:13:41.590 --> 01:13:41.600 align:start position:0%
so this bill deals with the process of
 
01:13:43.430 --> 01:13:43.440 align:start position:0%
keeping the voter list up to date on a
 
01:13:46.830 --> 01:13:46.840 align:start position:0%
regular basis of has already provided
 
01:13:48.310 --> 01:13:48.320 align:start position:0%
details I just want to add some
 
01:13:50.590 --> 01:13:50.600 align:start position:0%
background information I was interested
 
01:13:53.629 --> 01:13:53.639 align:start position:0%
in similar idea and when I learned that
 
01:13:56.470 --> 01:13:56.480 align:start position:0%
was working on this well I met with her
 
01:13:59.229 --> 01:13:59.239 align:start position:0%
and we combined our forces to come up
 
01:14:03.310 --> 01:14:03.320 align:start position:0%
with this bill I arranged a meeting with
 
01:14:07.470 --> 01:14:07.480 align:start position:0%
our with lary's Town supervisor of
 
01:14:11.070 --> 01:14:11.080 align:start position:0%
checklist Miss
 
01:14:15.350 --> 01:14:15.360 align:start position:0%
chur and we went over our ideas and much
 
01:14:18.550 --> 01:14:18.560 align:start position:0%
my pleasant surprise I learned that lary
 
01:14:20.910 --> 01:14:20.920 align:start position:0%
was already doing the practices that we
 
01:14:25.070 --> 01:14:25.080 align:start position:0%
were thinking about recommending so
 
01:14:28.070 --> 01:14:28.080 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm proud to announce that although
 
01:14:31.110 --> 01:14:31.120 align:start position:0%
this is not going to see it we had good
 
01:14:33.709 --> 01:14:33.719 align:start position:0%
good elction results in process has got
 
01:14:38.390 --> 01:14:38.400 align:start position:0%
smoothly and I for a fact that
 
01:14:41.229 --> 01:14:41.239 align:start position:0%
this has regular meetings to update the
 
01:14:43.510 --> 01:14:43.520 align:start position:0%
checklist so I believe these processes
 
01:14:46.310 --> 01:14:46.320 align:start position:0%
are a good foundation that perhaps old
 
01:14:48.629 --> 01:14:48.639 align:start position:0%
towns might like to do and that's one
 
01:14:51.350 --> 01:14:51.360 align:start position:0%
reason why we like to codify this to get
 
01:14:54.430 --> 01:14:54.440 align:start position:0%
into state law also had a conversation
 
01:14:58.110 --> 01:14:58.120 align:start position:0%
with our town clerk Cheryl Ferell who I
 
01:14:59.910 --> 01:14:59.920 align:start position:0%
believe I
 
01:15:04.229 --> 01:15:04.239 align:start position:0%
think chair presid of Association and I
 
01:15:06.030 --> 01:15:06.040 align:start position:0%
had a conversation with her last night
 
01:15:06.040 --> 01:15:09.149 align:start position:0%
had a conversation with her last night
she

01:15:09.149 --> 01:15:09.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:12.870 --> 01:15:12.880 align:start position:0%
said well this bill truly was a
 
01:15:16.790 --> 01:15:16.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:20.430 --> 01:15:20.440 align:start position:0%
knation and she gr draft Bill to
 
01:15:24.110 --> 01:15:24.120 align:start position:0%
complete agreement what we I'm try to
 
01:15:29.229 --> 01:15:29.239 align:start position:0%
say that uh you know I know that the um
 
01:15:32.709 --> 01:15:32.719 align:start position:0%
that the team inary work diligently to
 
01:15:34.750 --> 01:15:34.760 align:start position:0%
keep the checklist updated and I hope
 
01:15:37.149 --> 01:15:37.159 align:start position:0%
that this process in bill can give
 
01:15:38.709 --> 01:15:38.719 align:start position:0%
guidance to
 
01:15:41.350 --> 01:15:41.360 align:start position:0%
others same thing so I think it's a
 
01:15:44.070 --> 01:15:44.080 align:start position:0%
positive step and I hope that
 
01:15:47.149 --> 01:15:47.159 align:start position:0%

just like to say you know I I I don't
 
01:16:41.750 --> 01:16:41.760 align:start position:0%
see anything in this bill that is a
 
01:16:44.149 --> 01:16:44.159 align:start position:0%
problem for us to do but I would like to
 
01:16:47.229 --> 01:16:47.239 align:start position:0%
just State um the process that we
 
01:16:49.750 --> 01:16:49.760 align:start position:0%
currently have and the most fundamental
 
01:16:52.110 --> 01:16:52.120 align:start position:0%
thing about maintaining the checklist in
 
01:16:54.709 --> 01:16:54.719 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is that we have locally
 
01:16:58.110 --> 01:16:58.120 align:start position:0%
elected officials that maintain the
 
01:17:01.390 --> 01:17:01.400 align:start position:0%
checklist the only individuals that are
 
01:17:04.709 --> 01:17:04.719 align:start position:0%
authorized to put names on the checklist
 
01:17:07.669 --> 01:17:07.679 align:start position:0%
or take names off of the checklist are
 
01:17:09.550 --> 01:17:09.560 align:start position:0%
locally elected supervisors of the
 
01:17:11.950 --> 01:17:11.960 align:start position:0%
checklist or in case of cities there may
 
01:17:15.510 --> 01:17:15.520 align:start position:0%
be a board of registers uh for that
 
01:17:18.550 --> 01:17:18.560 align:start position:0%
purpose um the division of Vital Records
 
01:17:20.390 --> 01:17:20.400 align:start position:0%
is a division within the Secretary of
 
01:17:23.270 --> 01:17:23.280 align:start position:0%
State's office so we do receive the
 
01:17:27.430 --> 01:17:27.440 align:start position:0%
death data uh of uh of uh New Hampshire
 
01:17:30.110 --> 01:17:30.120 align:start position:0%
citizens that pass away um whether
 
01:17:31.870 --> 01:17:31.880 align:start position:0%
they're in state or whether they are out
 
01:17:35.270 --> 01:17:35.280 align:start position:0%
of state that information is transferred
 
01:17:37.390 --> 01:17:37.400 align:start position:0%
I believe it goes to the clerk's office
 
01:17:39.669 --> 01:17:39.679 align:start position:0%
who then make that information we should
 
01:17:41.229 --> 01:17:41.239 align:start position:0%
make that information available to the
 
01:17:43.870 --> 01:17:43.880 align:start position:0%
supervisors of the checklist so that
 
01:17:45.830 --> 01:17:45.840 align:start position:0%
they can confirm that those individuals
 
01:17:48.350 --> 01:17:48.360 align:start position:0%
did in fact pass away and that they are
 
01:17:50.870 --> 01:17:50.880 align:start position:0%
voters uh in the
 
01:17:54.350 --> 01:17:54.360 align:start position:0%
town um so that already happens I
 
01:17:58.189 --> 01:17:58.199 align:start position:0%
believe that there is uh uh currently
 
01:18:01.350 --> 01:18:01.360 align:start position:0%
exercises utilizing the the Postal
 
01:18:04.390 --> 01:18:04.400 align:start position:0%
Service change of address uh uh to
 
01:18:06.550 --> 01:18:06.560 align:start position:0%
notify local election officials of
 
01:18:10.189 --> 01:18:10.199 align:start position:0%
potential moves of Voters um there is
 
01:18:11.910 --> 01:18:11.920 align:start position:0%
nothing in there that is automatic that
 
01:18:13.270 --> 01:18:13.280 align:start position:0%
the Secretary of State make those
 
01:18:15.390 --> 01:18:15.400 align:start position:0%
changes because again the only ones
 
01:18:19.510 --> 01:18:19.520 align:start position:0%
authorized to uh uh make changes to the
 
01:18:22.550 --> 01:18:22.560 align:start position:0%
voter checklist are uh supervisors of
 
01:18:25.510 --> 01:18:25.520 align:start position:0%
the check list it's also important to
 
01:18:28.629 --> 01:18:28.639 align:start position:0%
understand that the checklist is
 
01:18:32.790 --> 01:18:32.800 align:start position:0%
dynamic it is changing minute to minute
 
01:18:34.950 --> 01:18:34.960 align:start position:0%
uh voters moving in registering voters
 
01:18:37.350 --> 01:18:37.360 align:start position:0%
passing away and being removed voters
 
01:18:40.790 --> 01:18:40.800 align:start position:0%
moov so it is always in a state of flux
 
01:18:42.430 --> 01:18:42.440 align:start position:0%
and because of that there is always
 
01:18:46.629 --> 01:18:46.639 align:start position:0%
going to be uh uh you know information
 
01:18:48.189 --> 01:18:48.199 align:start position:0%
on voters that may no longer be
 
01:18:50.510 --> 01:18:50.520 align:start position:0%
qualified either because they've died or
 
01:18:53.990 --> 01:18:54.000 align:start position:0%
or because they've moved I know that our
 
01:18:57.950 --> 01:18:57.960 align:start position:0%
office spends a great deal of time uh
 
01:18:59.790 --> 01:18:59.800 align:start position:0%
reviewing the names on the checklist
 
01:19:03.070 --> 01:19:03.080 align:start position:0%
looking for duplicate matches and when
 
01:19:05.910 --> 01:19:05.920 align:start position:0%
they can be confirmed make sure that
 
01:19:09.350 --> 01:19:09.360 align:start position:0%
that information is cleaned up and as
 
01:19:11.629 --> 01:19:11.639 align:start position:0%
the sponsor of the bill mentioned uh we
 
01:19:14.110 --> 01:19:14.120 align:start position:0%
will be conducting a purge of the
 
01:19:16.950 --> 01:19:16.960 align:start position:0%
checklist uh after the census is
 
01:19:20.790 --> 01:19:20.800 align:start position:0%
completed and uh that will remove I
 
01:19:23.229 --> 01:19:23.239 align:start position:0%
won't say it will remove any vote who
 
01:19:25.470 --> 01:19:25.480 align:start position:0%
has not been active for two election
 
01:19:28.950 --> 01:19:28.960 align:start position:0%
Cycles or four-year period uh will
 
01:19:31.470 --> 01:19:31.480 align:start position:0%
receive a 30-day letter sent to them by
 
01:19:33.990 --> 01:19:34.000 align:start position:0%
the supervisors of the checklist which
 
01:19:36.830 --> 01:19:36.840 align:start position:0%
is a request for information are you
 
01:19:41.070 --> 01:19:41.080 align:start position:0%
still are you still in town uh and and
 
01:19:43.310 --> 01:19:43.320 align:start position:0%
should remain on the checklist and if
 
01:19:45.550 --> 01:19:45.560 align:start position:0%
there is no response to that 30-day
 
01:19:49.030 --> 01:19:49.040 align:start position:0%
letter then th those names are uh are
 
01:19:51.870 --> 01:19:51.880 align:start position:0%
removed so after a purge we see a pretty
 
01:19:54.229 --> 01:19:54.239 align:start position:0%
dramatic drop in the increase of names
 
01:19:56.070 --> 01:19:56.080 align:start position:0%
on the checklist and then usually what
 
01:19:58.669 --> 01:19:58.679 align:start position:0%
happens is the following election cycle
 
01:20:00.590 --> 01:20:00.600 align:start position:0%
the numbers jump right back up again
 
01:20:02.990 --> 01:20:03.000 align:start position:0%
because the voters names who have been
 
01:20:05.470 --> 01:20:05.480 align:start position:0%
removed from the list surface somewhere
 
01:20:08.110 --> 01:20:08.120 align:start position:0%
and re-register to vote uh usually on
 
01:20:09.149 --> 01:20:09.159 align:start position:0%
the day of the
 
01:20:13.990 --> 01:20:14.000 align:start position:0%
election um so I would uh Madam chair it
 
01:20:17.110 --> 01:20:17.120 align:start position:0%
might be helpful at some point to have
 
01:20:19.990 --> 01:20:20.000 align:start position:0%
our hav office give a presentation on
 
01:20:21.990 --> 01:20:22.000 align:start position:0%
the uh centralized voter database that
 
01:20:24.189 --> 01:20:24.199 align:start position:0%
we have how it's maintained you know
 
01:20:27.149 --> 01:20:27.159 align:start position:0%
what information it contains that uh I
 
01:20:28.550 --> 01:20:28.560 align:start position:0%
think that would be really useful
 
01:20:30.590 --> 01:20:30.600 align:start position:0%
information for the committee and I
 
01:20:32.750 --> 01:20:32.760 align:start position:0%
would be happy to set that up and with
 
01:20:34.390 --> 01:20:34.400 align:start position:0%
that I'd be happy to answer any
 
01:20:36.669 --> 01:20:36.679 align:start position:0%
questions thank you Deputy scan we're
 
01:20:39.350 --> 01:20:39.360 align:start position:0%

box
 
01:21:27.470 --> 01:21:27.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:30.189 --> 01:21:30.199 align:start position:0%
here uh do you have to have a post
 
01:21:32.110 --> 01:21:32.120 align:start position:0%
office box we have people in my
 
01:21:34.310 --> 01:21:34.320 align:start position:0%
constituency who don't have Post Office
 
01:21:37.189 --> 01:21:37.199 align:start position:0%

address representative word you dropped
 
01:21:41.830 --> 01:21:41.840 align:start position:0%
off at the end you have constituents who

don't have a post office box or or a
 
01:21:47.149 --> 01:21:47.159 align:start position:0%

01:21:47.159 --> 01:21:48.070 align:start position:0%
fixed domicile their home houseless
people

01:21:48.070 --> 01:21:48.080 align:start position:0%
people
 
01:21:51.030 --> 01:21:51.040 align:start position:0%
B the if I understand the question
 
01:21:53.510 --> 01:21:53.520 align:start position:0%
correctly the domicile address can also
 
01:21:56.790 --> 01:21:56.800 align:start position:0%
be the mailing address um so a person
 
01:21:58.510 --> 01:21:58.520 align:start position:0%
does not have to provide a post office
 
01:22:01.229 --> 01:22:01.239 align:start position:0%
box to be able to register to be on the
 
01:22:04.550 --> 01:22:04.560 align:start position:0%
checklist as a voter uh but they can use
 
01:22:06.550 --> 01:22:06.560 align:start position:0%
a post office box as their mailing
 
01:22:08.430 --> 01:22:08.440 align:start position:0%
address as long as they provide a
 
01:22:11.830 --> 01:22:11.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:15.910 --> 01:22:15.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:19.070 --> 01:22:19.080 align:start position:0%
you the questions from anybody in the
 
01:22:22.110 --> 01:22:22.120 align:start position:0%
room Deputy scen I I do have a question
 
01:22:23.110 --> 01:22:23.120 align:start position:0%
it goes
 
01:22:26.229 --> 01:22:26.239 align:start position:0%
to just when the most registrations
 
01:22:28.910 --> 01:22:28.920 align:start position:0%
occur in the state I live in a community
 
01:22:31.790 --> 01:22:31.800 align:start position:0%
GS down which also has
 
01:22:34.550 --> 01:22:34.560 align:start position:0%
um I won't say transient but a lot of
 
01:22:36.070 --> 01:22:36.080 align:start position:0%
departments with people moving around
 
01:22:39.390 --> 01:22:39.400 align:start position:0%
not a dairy but certainly a lot and you
 
01:22:42.110 --> 01:22:42.120 align:start position:0%
mentioned that most of the registrations
 
01:22:46.270 --> 01:22:46.280 align:start position:0%
are on Election Day so is is there a
 
01:22:48.550 --> 01:22:48.560 align:start position:0%
ball park for what the percentage of
 
01:22:50.390 --> 01:22:50.400 align:start position:0%
registrations are that are occurring
 
01:22:52.750 --> 01:22:52.760 align:start position:0%
during the year as compared to on
 
01:22:52.760 --> 01:22:54.830 align:start position:0%
during the year as compared to on
election

01:22:54.830 --> 01:22:54.840 align:start position:0%
election
 
01:22:58.070 --> 01:22:58.080 align:start position:0%
day uh I would be happy to try and get
 
01:23:00.310 --> 01:23:00.320 align:start position:0%
that information for you I you know I I
 
01:23:03.030 --> 01:23:03.040 align:start position:0%
ass to recall that in any given election
 
01:23:05.430 --> 01:23:05.440 align:start position:0%
there might be 10% that actually
 
01:23:07.950 --> 01:23:07.960 align:start position:0%
register on the day of the election 10%
 
01:23:10.709 --> 01:23:10.719 align:start position:0%
of the voters on the checklist and you
 
01:23:13.990 --> 01:23:14.000 align:start position:0%
know I would say that that that is a
 
01:23:16.669 --> 01:23:16.679 align:start position:0%
high figure when you compare to the
 
01:23:19.189 --> 01:23:19.199 align:start position:0%
registrations that take place uh
 
01:23:21.709 --> 01:23:21.719 align:start position:0%
otherwise in the town clerk's office or
 
01:23:24.110 --> 01:23:24.120 align:start position:0%
at supervisor sessions in the balance of
 
01:23:27.030 --> 01:23:27.040 align:start position:0%
the year um I'll try and get that number
 
01:23:29.510 --> 01:23:29.520 align:start position:0%
for I see if I can break that out thank
 
01:23:31.629 --> 01:23:31.639 align:start position:0%
you wuty the reason I ask that is
 
01:23:35.430 --> 01:23:35.440 align:start position:0%
because I know in my community amount of
 
01:23:38.229 --> 01:23:38.239 align:start position:0%
registrations either directly before or
 
01:23:41.229 --> 01:23:41.239 align:start position:0%
on on Election Day
 
01:23:45.310 --> 01:23:45.320 align:start position:0%
is and this bill is addressing issue of
 
01:23:47.470 --> 01:23:47.480 align:start position:0%
correcting that list sort
 
01:23:49.950 --> 01:23:49.960 align:start position:0%
of where we have to get to the point
 
01:23:51.470 --> 01:23:51.480 align:start position:0%
where it's the bigger process
 
01:23:51.480 --> 01:23:53.270 align:start position:0%
where it's the bigger process
maintaining

01:23:53.270 --> 01:23:53.280 align:start position:0%
maintaining
 
01:23:56.030 --> 01:23:56.040 align:start position:0%
is there also a piece that the Secretary
 
01:23:57.950 --> 01:23:57.960 align:start position:0%
of State's office has thought about in
 
01:24:00.750 --> 01:24:00.760 align:start position:0%
regards to how to maintain the list in
 
01:24:02.149 --> 01:24:02.159 align:start position:0%
getting people to
 
01:24:04.750 --> 01:24:04.760 align:start position:0%
register as they move I mean because
 
01:24:06.390 --> 01:24:06.400 align:start position:0%
that's really what's going on like in a
 
01:24:09.590 --> 01:24:09.600 align:start position:0%
community like Dairy to a great extent
 
01:24:12.149 --> 01:24:12.159 align:start position:0%
nobody's re-registering when they they
 
01:24:15.830 --> 01:24:15.840 align:start position:0%
move how do has this the office thought
 
01:24:17.470 --> 01:24:17.480 align:start position:0%
at all about that because it seems to me
 
01:24:19.870 --> 01:24:19.880 align:start position:0%
make it a lot easier for our communities
 
01:24:21.510 --> 01:24:21.520 align:start position:0%
if we could sort of get that information
 
01:24:23.310 --> 01:24:23.320 align:start position:0%
out there
 
01:24:24.709 --> 01:24:24.719 align:start position:0%
there's there's no requirement that a
 
01:24:27.870 --> 01:24:27.880 align:start position:0%
voter has to let the town know that
 
01:24:30.750 --> 01:24:30.760 align:start position:0%
they're skipping Town they're leaving um
 
01:24:32.910 --> 01:24:32.920 align:start position:0%
we do have a have a line on the voter
 
01:24:35.990 --> 01:24:36.000 align:start position:0%
registration form so that if a voter uh
 
01:24:39.189 --> 01:24:39.199 align:start position:0%
registers in a new town or a different
 
01:24:43.109 --> 01:24:43.119 align:start position:0%
ward in a city that they can provide the
 
01:24:46.310 --> 01:24:46.320 align:start position:0%
last location uh that they were a voter
 
01:24:48.310 --> 01:24:48.320 align:start position:0%
and that information shows up in the
 
01:24:52.030 --> 01:24:52.040 align:start position:0%
database um and is provided to the town
 
01:24:54.550 --> 01:24:54.560 align:start position:0%
or the Ward City that they used to live
 
01:24:57.310 --> 01:24:57.320 align:start position:0%
in so that that that voter's name can be
 
01:25:00.149 --> 01:25:00.159 align:start position:0%
automatically removed by the
 
01:25:02.830 --> 01:25:02.840 align:start position:0%
supervisors uh in that
 
01:25:04.669 --> 01:25:04.679 align:start position:0%
situation um I don't know if that
 
01:25:08.109 --> 01:25:08.119 align:start position:0%
answered your question but but uh but
 
01:25:10.990 --> 01:25:11.000 align:start position:0%
there is a lag between the time that you
 
01:25:13.629 --> 01:25:13.639 align:start position:0%
know you have a a big wave of election
 
01:25:13.639 --> 01:25:14.629 align:start position:0%
know you have a a big wave of election
day

01:25:14.629 --> 01:25:14.639 align:start position:0%
day
 
01:25:17.270 --> 01:25:17.280 align:start position:0%
registrations and then cleaning up the
 
01:25:20.070 --> 01:25:20.080 align:start position:0%
duplicates that exist because those same
 
01:25:22.750 --> 01:25:22.760 align:start position:0%
voters are still on the checklist in the
 
01:25:26.470 --> 01:25:26.480 align:start position:0%
old town that they came from thank you
 
01:25:28.390 --> 01:25:28.400 align:start position:0%
representative thank you madam chair
 
01:25:30.550 --> 01:25:30.560 align:start position:0%
thanks again Deputy for taking the
 
01:25:32.550 --> 01:25:32.560 align:start position:0%
question I'd ask the prime form I'm
 
01:25:34.510 --> 01:25:34.520 align:start position:0%
going to follow with you on this if we
 
01:25:40.229 --> 01:25:40.239 align:start position:0%
keep any statistics or data to show same
 
01:25:42.629 --> 01:25:42.639 align:start position:0%
day voter registrations for example
 
01:25:45.109 --> 01:25:45.119 align:start position:0%
let's say in a particular town 200
 
01:25:47.709 --> 01:25:47.719 align:start position:0%
people signed up to register to vote the
 
01:25:50.390 --> 01:25:50.400 align:start position:0%
same day how many of those return in the
 
01:25:52.830 --> 01:25:52.840 align:start position:0%
next election cycle out of you know we
 
01:25:56.870 --> 01:25:56.880 align:start position:0%
keep any kind of data or statistic on
 
01:26:00.550 --> 01:26:00.560 align:start position:0%
that uh we do have a voter history
 
01:26:03.310 --> 01:26:03.320 align:start position:0%
um you know I'm sure because it's in the
 
01:26:06.109 --> 01:26:06.119 align:start position:0%
database that some analysis can be made
 
01:26:08.750 --> 01:26:08.760 align:start position:0%
of that
 
01:26:11.470 --> 01:26:11.480 align:start position:0%
um you know if if you have more specific
 
01:26:13.470 --> 01:26:13.480 align:start position:0%
questions I might be able to see if if
 
01:26:15.990 --> 01:26:16.000 align:start position:0%
in aggregate form we can you know we can
 
01:26:19.590 --> 01:26:19.600 align:start position:0%
pull some uh you know some
 
01:26:24.709 --> 01:26:24.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:27.390 --> 01:26:27.400 align:start position:0%
yes thank you uh Madam chair and thank
 
01:26:27.400 --> 01:26:30.750 align:start position:0%
yes thank you uh Madam chair and thank
you

01:26:30.750 --> 01:26:30.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:32.750 --> 01:26:32.760 align:start position:0%
secretary the
 
01:26:37.990 --> 01:26:38.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:44.149 --> 01:26:44.159 align:start position:0%
London it how widespread is that I know
 
01:26:45.910 --> 01:26:45.920 align:start position:0%
I mean I could give you an anecdotal
 
01:26:45.920 --> 01:26:47.510 align:start position:0%
I mean I could give you an anecdotal
example

01:26:47.510 --> 01:26:47.520 align:start position:0%
example
 
01:26:50.270 --> 01:26:50.280 align:start position:0%
but the 10
 
01:26:53.070 --> 01:26:53.080 align:start position:0%
year when I I question
 
01:26:56.750 --> 01:26:56.760 align:start position:0%
this process before the 10e scrub was
 
01:26:58.870 --> 01:26:58.880 align:start position:0%
the extent of the process as it was
 
01:27:01.709 --> 01:27:01.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:05.550 --> 01:27:05.560 align:start position:0%
me they uh appear to have been and the
 
01:27:06.870 --> 01:27:06.880 align:start position:0%
sorts of things that are in this
 
01:27:11.109 --> 01:27:11.119 align:start position:0%
legislation how widespread in the
 
01:27:14.910 --> 01:27:14.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:14.920 --> 01:27:17.510 align:start position:0%
 
more

01:27:17.510 --> 01:27:17.520 align:start position:0%
more
 
01:27:21.109 --> 01:27:21.119 align:start position:0%
forward positive
 
01:27:21.119 --> 01:27:24.470 align:start position:0%
forward positive
process

01:27:24.470 --> 01:27:24.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:29.470 --> 01:27:29.480 align:start position:0%
um if if I understand your your question
 
01:27:32.070 --> 01:27:32.080 align:start position:0%
it's uh you know how many other towns go
 
01:27:35.430 --> 01:27:35.440 align:start position:0%
through the process that Derry did um in
 
01:27:38.350 --> 01:27:38.360 align:start position:0%
cleaning up their list you know I think
 
01:27:42.070 --> 01:27:42.080 align:start position:0%
towns uh because we have a system that
 
01:27:45.189 --> 01:27:45.199 align:start position:0%
relies on the local communities and the
 
01:27:47.669 --> 01:27:47.679 align:start position:0%
local election officials to actually run
 
01:27:50.229 --> 01:27:50.239 align:start position:0%
the elections whether it's uh taking
 
01:27:51.590 --> 01:27:51.600 align:start position:0%
care of voter registrations and
 
01:27:53.270 --> 01:27:53.280 align:start position:0%
maintaining the checklist at the local
 
01:27:55.310 --> 01:27:55.320 align:start position:0%
level to actually running the
 
01:27:58.910 --> 01:27:58.920 align:start position:0%
elections um they there are different
 
01:28:01.669 --> 01:28:01.679 align:start position:0%
levels of of
 
01:28:04.950 --> 01:28:04.960 align:start position:0%
um uh I'll say proactiveness in in
 
01:28:07.510 --> 01:28:07.520 align:start position:0%
getting that job done and it it reflects
 
01:28:08.669 --> 01:28:08.679 align:start position:0%
you know the people that are actually
 
01:28:12.350 --> 01:28:12.360 align:start position:0%
doing the job and uh overall you know I
 
01:28:13.870 --> 01:28:13.880 align:start position:0%
think it works well for the State of New
 
01:28:15.430 --> 01:28:15.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I mean are there some areas
 
01:28:17.310 --> 01:28:17.320 align:start position:0%
where you maybe the job isn't getting
 
01:28:20.590 --> 01:28:20.600 align:start position:0%
done as it should absolutely um and then
 
01:28:22.310 --> 01:28:22.320 align:start position:0%
you have the Other Extreme where you
 
01:28:24.590 --> 01:28:24.600 align:start position:0%
know you have communities that are just
 
01:28:27.950 --> 01:28:27.960 align:start position:0%
really keeping up with um you know with
 
01:28:29.390 --> 01:28:29.400 align:start position:0%
the changes on the
 
01:28:32.350 --> 01:28:32.360 align:start position:0%
checklist and and that's just it's
 
01:28:35.669 --> 01:28:35.679 align:start position:0%
ingrained in our system um what I can
 
01:28:37.430 --> 01:28:37.440 align:start position:0%
tell you is that you know we have had
 
01:28:41.750 --> 01:28:41.760 align:start position:0%
exercises in uh in cleaning the list up
 
01:28:43.750 --> 01:28:43.760 align:start position:0%
uh we did go through the effort probably
 
01:28:47.990 --> 01:28:48.000 align:start position:0%
six uh six or so years ago where New
 
01:28:49.870 --> 01:28:49.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire participated in the interstate
 
01:28:52.350 --> 01:28:52.360 align:start position:0%
cross check program uh that was
 
01:28:56.070 --> 01:28:56.080 align:start position:0%
controversial at the time um but we did
 
01:28:59.950 --> 01:28:59.960 align:start position:0%
receive uh I think it was 99,000 matches
 
01:29:02.709 --> 01:29:02.719 align:start position:0%
of duplicate voters with the same name
 
01:29:05.870 --> 01:29:05.880 align:start position:0%
same date of birth uh in in New
 
01:29:07.510 --> 01:29:07.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and other states around the
 
01:29:10.870 --> 01:29:10.880 align:start position:0%
country and uh after we paired through
 
01:29:13.470 --> 01:29:13.480 align:start position:0%
we we actually spent the time to winnow
 
01:29:16.590 --> 01:29:16.600 align:start position:0%
that down uh to just a few hundred
 
01:29:19.550 --> 01:29:19.560 align:start position:0%
voters where uh you know we had to do
 
01:29:22.109 --> 01:29:22.119 align:start position:0%
more research to make sure that that
 
01:29:24.390 --> 01:29:24.400 align:start position:0%
those people were not the same
 
01:29:26.750 --> 01:29:26.760 align:start position:0%
individual and what is amazing is how
 
01:29:28.229 --> 01:29:28.239 align:start position:0%
many people in this
 
01:29:31.390 --> 01:29:31.400 align:start position:0%
country have your name and your date of
 
01:29:34.270 --> 01:29:34.280 align:start position:0%
birth it is it's it's
 
01:29:37.990 --> 01:29:38.000 align:start position:0%
frightening um but but uh but getting
 
01:29:39.950 --> 01:29:39.960 align:start position:0%
back to to the results I mean we
 
01:29:43.229 --> 01:29:43.239 align:start position:0%
continued to pair that down to a list of
 
01:29:45.950 --> 01:29:45.960 align:start position:0%
you know it was less than a hundred uh
 
01:29:49.310 --> 01:29:49.320 align:start position:0%
where it did appear that there were uh
 
01:29:52.350 --> 01:29:52.360 align:start position:0%
individuals same name same date of birth
 
01:29:55.229 --> 01:29:55.239 align:start position:0%
voting in the same election uh in
 
01:29:57.629 --> 01:29:57.639 align:start position:0%
different locations and with the
 
01:29:59.229 --> 01:29:59.239 align:start position:0%
attorney general's review they did end
 
01:29:59.239 --> 01:30:00.189 align:start position:0%
attorney general's review they did end
up

01:30:00.189 --> 01:30:00.199 align:start position:0%
up
 
01:30:02.189 --> 01:30:02.199 align:start position:0%
Prosecuting uh you know wasn't a lot of
 
01:30:06.510 --> 01:30:06.520 align:start position:0%
people but um you know it it was enough
 
01:30:08.990 --> 01:30:09.000 align:start position:0%
to say that you know there is there are
 
01:30:12.070 --> 01:30:12.080 align:start position:0%
isolated instances of of uh fraudulent
 
01:30:15.030 --> 01:30:15.040 align:start position:0%
voting out there um not on a grand scale
 
01:30:17.669 --> 01:30:17.679 align:start position:0%
not organized but but in individual
 
01:30:20.070 --> 01:30:20.080 align:start position:0%
cases there are people that try and game
 
01:30:22.950 --> 01:30:22.960 align:start position:0%
the system and so that was an exercise
 
01:30:24.910 --> 01:30:24.920 align:start position:0%
where you know we were able to you know
 
01:30:27.910 --> 01:30:27.920 align:start position:0%
do some list cleaning uh you know verify
 
01:30:30.350 --> 01:30:30.360 align:start position:0%
voters but it was incredibly time
 
01:30:33.510 --> 01:30:33.520 align:start position:0%
consuming and and there are resources
 
01:30:36.270 --> 01:30:36.280 align:start position:0%
you know in terms of Staff time and and
 
01:30:39.070 --> 01:30:39.080 align:start position:0%
finances that are required to do that
 
01:30:41.669 --> 01:30:41.679 align:start position:0%
and so you know these things can be done
 
01:30:43.709 --> 01:30:43.719 align:start position:0%
but it also has to be recognized that
 
01:30:45.189 --> 01:30:45.199 align:start position:0%
that there is a cost that goes along
 
01:30:45.199 --> 01:30:46.070 align:start position:0%
that there is a cost that goes along
with

01:30:46.070 --> 01:30:46.080 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:30:48.669 --> 01:30:48.679 align:start position:0%
that thank you further questions for

you I'm not sure what the cause of the
 
01:31:49.870 --> 01:31:49.880 align:start position:0%
delay was but thank you again my name's

Louise Spencer I'm from conquered New
 
01:31:55.270 --> 01:31:55.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um I hadn't initially intended
 
01:31:58.550 --> 01:31:58.560 align:start position:0%
to speak but upon hearing the discussion
 
01:32:01.629 --> 01:32:01.639 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to note a few things in
 
01:32:05.870 --> 01:32:05.880 align:start position:0%
regard to deputy secretary scanlan's
 
01:32:09.790 --> 01:32:09.800 align:start position:0%
testimony um which was regarding the
 
01:32:13.390 --> 01:32:13.400 align:start position:0%
cross check process that the state went
 
01:32:16.270 --> 01:32:16.280 align:start position:0%
through um it was an incredibly time
 
01:32:19.870 --> 01:32:19.880 align:start position:0%
consuming process with many many many
 
01:32:22.430 --> 01:32:22.440 align:start position:0%
false positives other in other words
 
01:32:24.950 --> 01:32:24.960 align:start position:0%
people that were identified as po
 
01:32:28.270 --> 01:32:28.280 align:start position:0%
potentially not being qualified voters
 
01:32:31.229 --> 01:32:31.239 align:start position:0%
who upon further investigation were
 
01:32:37.030 --> 01:32:37.040 align:start position:0%
determined to um in fact be um eligible
 
01:32:42.350 --> 01:32:42.360 align:start position:0%
or to have legitimately moved um one way
 
01:32:46.189 --> 01:32:46.199 align:start position:0%
or the other there is a um an
 
01:32:49.030 --> 01:32:49.040 align:start position:0%
alternative solution that can help
 
01:32:53.070 --> 01:32:53.080 align:start position:0%
provide um much useful d data in real
 
01:32:56.390 --> 01:32:56.400 align:start position:0%
time and um your own colleague here on
 
01:32:58.870 --> 01:32:58.880 align:start position:0%
this committee representative silver
 
01:33:01.590 --> 01:33:01.600 align:start position:0%
mentioned it at a prior hearing and that
 
01:33:05.550 --> 01:33:05.560 align:start position:0%
is the Eric system and this is a system
 
01:33:09.189 --> 01:33:09.199 align:start position:0%
that um is expanding I believe there
 
01:33:12.109 --> 01:33:12.119 align:start position:0%
there are well over 30 States now that
 
01:33:16.109 --> 01:33:16.119 align:start position:0%
participate and share data there is also
 
01:33:19.390 --> 01:33:19.400 align:start position:0%
information that come flows through the
 
01:33:24.830 --> 01:33:24.840 align:start position:0%
DMV that identify voters that have moved
 
01:33:27.270 --> 01:33:27.280 align:start position:0%
um both out of state and within the
 
01:33:31.830 --> 01:33:31.840 align:start position:0%
state so that uh towns have the ability
 
01:33:35.790 --> 01:33:35.800 align:start position:0%
to um would have the ability to keep
 
01:33:39.310 --> 01:33:39.320 align:start position:0%
their checklists more up to date um this
 
01:33:42.149 --> 01:33:42.159 align:start position:0%
is a critically important issue for the
 
01:33:44.149 --> 01:33:44.159 align:start position:0%
Integrity of our
 
01:33:47.950 --> 01:33:47.960 align:start position:0%
elections um it is uh I think we all
 
01:33:52.030 --> 01:33:52.040 align:start position:0%
agree that it is essential that um we
 
01:33:54.310 --> 01:33:54.320 align:start position:0%
have the most update uh up-to-date
 
01:33:57.910 --> 01:33:57.920 align:start position:0%
information that we can have it saves um
 
01:34:01.070 --> 01:34:01.080 align:start position:0%
tremendous amount of work for our
 
01:34:03.550 --> 01:34:03.560 align:start position:0%
election officials who are already so
 
01:34:06.709 --> 01:34:06.719 align:start position:0%
incredibly hardworking it's it's I I
 
01:34:09.709 --> 01:34:09.719 align:start position:0%
think that was completely underscored by
 
01:34:13.510 --> 01:34:13.520 align:start position:0%
uh the last election cycle and it also
 
01:34:17.070 --> 01:34:17.080 align:start position:0%
helps ensure the public that um you know
 
01:34:20.189 --> 01:34:20.199 align:start position:0%
to the extent possible that these roles
 
01:34:24.590 --> 01:34:24.600 align:start position:0%
reflect all of those folks who are um
 
01:34:28.750 --> 01:34:28.760 align:start position:0%
who are legitimately uh registered and
 
01:34:31.149 --> 01:34:31.159 align:start position:0%
um you know
 
01:34:35.790 --> 01:34:35.800 align:start position:0%
constitutionally um eligible voters so
 
01:34:39.229 --> 01:34:39.239 align:start position:0%
uh I just wanted to add that point um
 
01:34:41.709 --> 01:34:41.719 align:start position:0%
and I'm happy to send along additional
 
01:34:44.590 --> 01:34:44.600 align:start position:0%
information about
 
01:34:48.590 --> 01:34:48.600 align:start position:0%
Eric I'm happy to take
 
01:34:50.550 --> 01:34:50.560 align:start position:0%
questions questions for anybody

01:36:29.629 --> 01:36:29.639 align:start position:0%
secretary about the time that went into
 
01:36:32.830 --> 01:36:32.840 align:start position:0%
looking through the cross check data and
 
01:36:35.550 --> 01:36:35.560 align:start position:0%
the staff costs associated with that
 
01:36:39.390 --> 01:36:39.400 align:start position:0%
Eric for a um fee of around 20 to
 
01:36:42.629 --> 01:36:42.639 align:start position:0%
$225,000 a year uh would provide the

01:36:54.669 --> 01:36:54.679 align:start position:0%
having to come through all that data by
 
01:36:58.149 --> 01:36:58.159 align:start position:0%
just getting a file sent to Eric um so
 
01:36:59.870 --> 01:36:59.880 align:start position:0%
just wanted to you know as I read
 
01:37:01.590 --> 01:37:01.600 align:start position:0%
through this bill it really does touch
 
01:37:04.430 --> 01:37:04.440 align:start position:0%
on a lot of the work Eric could do um
 
01:37:06.470 --> 01:37:06.480 align:start position:0%
and at a much more coste efficient uh
 
01:37:08.830 --> 01:37:08.840 align:start position:0%
price point Thank you thank you
 
01:37:11.950 --> 01:37:11.960 align:start position:0%

the bipar and hous Bill in a small way
 
01:38:25.790 --> 01:38:25.800 align:start position:0%
modern the way conduct our elction
 
01:38:29.430 --> 01:38:29.440 align:start position:0%
CA 2020 we saw a record number of Bot
 
01:38:32.510 --> 01:38:32.520 align:start position:0%
request due to the covid-19 pmic while
 
01:38:34.709 --> 01:38:34.719 align:start position:0%
2020 was certainly not a normal year
 
01:38:36.350 --> 01:38:36.360 align:start position:0%
what is normal is the growing number of
 
01:38:41.229 --> 01:38:41.239 align:start position:0%
abely B reest perent of the are
 
01:38:45.870 --> 01:38:45.880 align:start position:0%
State sh increase in importance in
 
01:38:50.470 --> 01:38:50.480 align:start position:0%
identifying voters and as a Cate early
 
01:38:52.109 --> 01:38:52.119 align:start position:0%
we put you know that when somebody
 
01:38:53.950 --> 01:38:53.960 align:start position:0%
requests an absente ballot that they are
 
01:38:57.030 --> 01:38:57.040 align:start position:0%
going to vote in 2020 well over 90% of
 
01:38:59.350 --> 01:38:59.360 align:start position:0%
abente ballots will returned as a
 
01:39:01.270 --> 01:39:01.280 align:start position:0%
candidate we need to be able to contact
 
01:39:03.910 --> 01:39:03.920 align:start position:0%
these voters in a kindly man once they
 
01:39:05.270 --> 01:39:05.280 align:start position:0%
have passed their
 
01:39:08.510 --> 01:39:08.520 align:start position:0%
vote in reality they're not taking it
 
01:39:11.990 --> 01:39:12.000 align:start position:0%
back enter HB 326 this bill would
 
01:39:13.990 --> 01:39:14.000 align:start position:0%
require that town clerk provid list of
 
01:39:16.910 --> 01:39:16.920 align:start position:0%
ab request electronically if requested
 
01:39:18.910 --> 01:39:18.920 align:start position:0%
by the candidate this is the list that
 
01:39:21.070 --> 01:39:21.080 align:start position:0%
is already that is already currently
 
01:39:23.229 --> 01:39:23.239 align:start position:0%
aable to candidates but what is not
 
01:39:24.910 --> 01:39:24.920 align:start position:0%
required for the town clerks to provide
 
01:39:27.629 --> 01:39:27.639 align:start position:0%
them electronically there are some Town
 
01:39:29.750 --> 01:39:29.760 align:start position:0%
clerks who will withhold the list unless
 
01:39:31.589 --> 01:39:31.599 align:start position:0%
the candidate or the representative
 
01:39:33.430 --> 01:39:33.440 align:start position:0%
physically shows up at the office and
 
01:39:35.589 --> 01:39:35.599 align:start position:0%
requests it with payment in
 
01:39:37.629 --> 01:39:37.639 align:start position:0%
hand as we are currently in the
 
01:39:40.950 --> 01:39:40.960 align:start position:0%
electronic page this isly ridiculous to
 
01:39:42.709 --> 01:39:42.719 align:start position:0%
force candidates who in New Hampshire
 
01:39:44.990 --> 01:39:45.000 align:start position:0%
are already volunteers to physically be
 
01:39:46.790 --> 01:39:46.800 align:start position:0%
at the town clerk's office during work
 
01:39:49.470 --> 01:39:49.480 align:start position:0%
hours is an unnecessary burden the
 
01:39:51.470 --> 01:39:51.480 align:start position:0%
clerks all have electronic system and
 
01:39:53.990 --> 01:39:54.000 align:start position:0%
record keeping so so simply forwarding
 
01:39:56.750 --> 01:39:56.760 align:start position:0%
said L is not an undo or overbearing
 
01:39:59.070 --> 01:39:59.080 align:start position:0%
request candidates for higher office and
 
01:40:01.189 --> 01:40:01.199 align:start position:0%
candidates who represent multiple towns
 
01:40:02.830 --> 01:40:02.840 align:start position:0%
should not be handicapped in attempting
 
01:40:05.189 --> 01:40:05.199 align:start position:0%
to conduct more modern fastpaced
 
01:40:07.950 --> 01:40:07.960 align:start position:0%
campaign one house be fun bills that
 
01:40:10.070 --> 01:40:10.080 align:start position:0%
prohibit Town clerks from withholding
 
01:40:12.229 --> 01:40:12.239 align:start position:0%
the list in Le of payment as there have
 
01:40:13.910 --> 01:40:13.920 align:start position:0%
been issues in the past with some clerks
 
01:40:15.790 --> 01:40:15.800 align:start position:0%
using that as an excuse to not provide
 
01:40:18.270 --> 01:40:18.280 align:start position:0%
the list in a timely man I look forward
 
01:40:19.669 --> 01:40:19.679 align:start position:0%
to hearing the committee's thoughts on
 
01:40:21.669 --> 01:40:21.679 align:start position:0%
this and of course I urge the consider a
 
01:40:23.990 --> 01:40:24.000 align:start position:0%
recommendation of to pass and I am happy
 
01:40:27.270 --> 01:40:27.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:29.990 --> 01:40:30.000 align:start position:0%
questions representative sweet thank you
 
01:40:31.470 --> 01:40:31.480 align:start position:0%
madam chair and thank you representative
 
01:40:33.310 --> 01:40:33.320 align:start position:0%
Barry for uh for testifying and taking
 
01:40:35.589 --> 01:40:35.599 align:start position:0%
my question um you your bill would
 
01:40:37.030 --> 01:40:37.040 align:start position:0%
essentially make it so that they would
 
01:40:38.629 --> 01:40:38.639 align:start position:0%
email the list over to candidates
 
01:40:40.990 --> 01:40:41.000 align:start position:0%
instead of printing them on paper so how
 
01:40:42.990 --> 01:40:43.000 align:start position:0%
much paper do you think we would save
 
01:40:45.629 --> 01:40:45.639 align:start position:0%
from being discarded in the environment
 
01:40:47.510 --> 01:40:47.520 align:start position:0%
I don't know if quantify the amount of
 
01:40:49.270 --> 01:40:49.280 align:start position:0%
paper we say but there is an
 
01:40:50.990 --> 01:40:51.000 align:start position:0%
environmental impact to this bill you
 
01:40:52.910 --> 01:40:52.920 align:start position:0%
know having people drive unnecessarily
 
01:40:55.149 --> 01:40:55.159 align:start position:0%
to their town clerk's office to say hey
 
01:40:57.510 --> 01:40:57.520 align:start position:0%
I'm here hand a list um that there's
 
01:41:05.790 --> 01:41:05.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:09.030 --> 01:41:09.040 align:start position:0%
Environ representative Brian thank you
 
01:41:12.310 --> 01:41:12.320 align:start position:0%
madam chair have you heard anything from
 
01:41:15.070 --> 01:41:15.080 align:start position:0%
clerks who say that this will cost their
 
01:41:17.310 --> 01:41:17.320 align:start position:0%
Town's money I I don't know how this
 
01:41:19.669 --> 01:41:19.679 align:start position:0%
will C to money they're already maintain
 
01:41:21.790 --> 01:41:21.800 align:start position:0%
electronic list I believe State's office
 
01:41:24.070 --> 01:41:24.080 align:start position:0%
actually assists them with maintaining
 
01:41:27.629 --> 01:41:27.639 align:start position:0%
abute electronically um this is 2021 no
 
01:41:29.750 --> 01:41:29.760 align:start position:0%
one has a paper L anymore if they're not
 
01:41:31.510 --> 01:41:31.520 align:start position:0%
keeping this electronically that's a
 
01:41:34.990 --> 01:41:35.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:37.270 --> 01:41:37.280 align:start position:0%
problem further questions from committee
 
01:41:38.310 --> 01:41:38.320 align:start position:0%
members in
 
01:41:42.149 --> 01:41:42.159 align:start position:0%
attendance representative berser on yes
 
01:41:44.109 --> 01:41:44.119 align:start position:0%
uh thank you madam chairman uh
 
01:41:45.870 --> 01:41:45.880 align:start position:0%
representative just a couple quick
 
01:41:49.270 --> 01:41:49.280 align:start position:0%
questions if I may um first how much
 
01:41:50.870 --> 01:41:50.880 align:start position:0%
time do you think the clerk should have
 
01:41:53.990 --> 01:41:54.000 align:start position:0%
have have to respond to a request for
 
01:42:02.149 --> 01:42:02.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:06.030 --> 01:42:06.040 align:start position:0%
be but in my opinion should be a daily
 
01:42:07.870 --> 01:42:07.880 align:start position:0%
response requested we're talking about
 
01:42:10.149 --> 01:42:10.159 align:start position:0%
sending an
 
01:42:12.589 --> 01:42:12.599 align:start position:0%
email okay a further question Madam
 
01:42:12.599 --> 01:42:14.790 align:start position:0%
email okay a further question Madam
chair

01:42:14.790 --> 01:42:14.800 align:start position:0%
chair
 
01:42:17.070 --> 01:42:17.080 align:start position:0%
representa um should there be
 
01:42:19.870 --> 01:42:19.880 align:start position:0%
established a flat fee uh because I know
 
01:42:21.510 --> 01:42:21.520 align:start position:0%
that cities and towns probably have
 
01:42:24.070 --> 01:42:24.080 align:start position:0%
various fees if there were a flat fee
 
01:42:25.830 --> 01:42:25.840 align:start position:0%
then payment perhaps could be paid
 
01:42:28.030 --> 01:42:28.040 align:start position:0%
either by check or by credit card in
 
01:42:30.750 --> 01:42:30.760 align:start position:0%
advance of releasing the information so
 
01:42:34.629 --> 01:42:34.639 align:start position:0%
I did consider this um and I I would
 
01:42:36.430 --> 01:42:36.440 align:start position:0%
love if there was a flat Fe across the
 
01:42:38.790 --> 01:42:38.800 align:start position:0%
board based on the let's say the size of
 
01:42:40.589 --> 01:42:40.599 align:start position:0%
the Town you're requesting it in right
 
01:42:42.109 --> 01:42:42.119 align:start position:0%
there's obviously different record
 
01:42:43.629 --> 01:42:43.639 align:start position:0%
keeping requirements for larger and
 
01:42:45.950 --> 01:42:45.960 align:start position:0%
smaller town I did not include that in
 
01:42:48.589 --> 01:42:48.599 align:start position:0%
this bill because I did not want that to
 
01:42:51.390 --> 01:42:51.400 align:start position:0%
be reason not to pass it because do have
 
01:42:54.830 --> 01:42:54.840 align:start position:0%
towns that set the cost of producing
 
01:42:57.030 --> 01:42:57.040 align:start position:0%
documents largely for 918 and right to
 
01:42:58.830 --> 01:42:58.840 align:start position:0%
no request and I didn't want you tangle
 
01:43:01.589 --> 01:43:01.599 align:start position:0%
up into that debate if you feel that we
 
01:43:04.510 --> 01:43:04.520 align:start position:0%
can pass that legislation on a thatly
 
01:43:06.310 --> 01:43:06.320 align:start position:0%
basis I would be an enthusiastic
 
01:43:07.629 --> 01:43:07.639 align:start position:0%
supporter of that I didn't want to
 
01:43:10.430 --> 01:43:10.440 align:start position:0%
hinder the overall idea okay thank you
 
01:43:12.430 --> 01:43:12.440 align:start position:0%
very much no further
 
01:43:14.910 --> 01:43:14.920 align:start position:0%
questions thank you further questions
 
01:43:19.669 --> 01:43:19.679 align:start position:0%
from any committee members on this
 
01:43:19.679 --> 01:43:22.629 align:start position:0%
from any committee members on this

bill
 
01:43:24.790 --> 01:43:24.800 align:start position:0%
I'm not seeing any representative here
 
01:43:28.310 --> 01:43:28.320 align:start position:0%
thank you repr for introducing the bill
 
01:43:31.669 --> 01:43:31.679 align:start position:0%
also signed up to speak on this bill is
 
01:43:34.589 --> 01:43:34.599 align:start position:0%
Miss Robinson Miss Robinson I believe
 
01:43:39.070 --> 01:43:39.080 align:start position:0%
you are with us as the welcome thank you
 
01:43:43.270 --> 01:43:43.280 align:start position:0%
very much um I wanted can you hear me
 
01:43:45.310 --> 01:43:45.320 align:start position:0%
yes we can but okay great thank you very
 
01:43:48.430 --> 01:43:48.440 align:start position:0%
much sorry um I appreciate this bill
 
01:43:51.109 --> 01:43:51.119 align:start position:0%
being considered and espe especially
 
01:43:52.470 --> 01:43:52.480 align:start position:0%
having worked with a number of
 
01:43:55.350 --> 01:43:55.360 align:start position:0%
candidates I wanted to Simply make a
 
01:43:59.550 --> 01:43:59.560 align:start position:0%
clarification under line six of the bill
 
01:44:04.109 --> 01:44:04.119 align:start position:0%
um it says electronic copies and I would
 
01:44:06.350 --> 01:44:06.360 align:start position:0%
appreciate it if it could say electronic
 
01:44:10.510 --> 01:44:10.520 align:start position:0%
data file what we have found in the past
 
01:44:15.709 --> 01:44:15.719 align:start position:0%
is that uh yes Town clerks will provide
 
01:44:20.149 --> 01:44:20.159 align:start position:0%
an electronic list and it is a PDF file
 
01:44:23.669 --> 01:44:23.679 align:start position:0%
which is almost impossible to use and
 
01:44:25.310 --> 01:44:25.320 align:start position:0%
requires if you're going to mail
 
01:44:30.229 --> 01:44:30.239 align:start position:0%
somebody something uh to invite them to
 
01:44:33.629 --> 01:44:33.639 align:start position:0%
uh vote for the candidate as with their
 
01:44:36.990 --> 01:44:37.000 align:start position:0%
absentee ballot it requires transferring
 
01:44:40.910 --> 01:44:40.920 align:start position:0%
all that information into
 
01:44:44.229 --> 01:44:44.239 align:start position:0%
um an Excel file or something like that
 
01:44:46.910 --> 01:44:46.920 align:start position:0%
that cannot be used as far as
 
01:44:46.920 --> 01:44:48.470 align:start position:0%
that cannot be used as far as
electronically

01:44:48.470 --> 01:44:48.480 align:start position:0%
electronically
 
01:44:50.870 --> 01:44:50.880 align:start position:0%
manipulated and so that would be having
 
01:44:55.229 --> 01:44:55.239 align:start position:0%
a sortable file would be really helpful
 
01:45:00.870 --> 01:45:00.880 align:start position:0%
um and as to the question of the um cost
 
01:45:03.189 --> 01:45:03.199 align:start position:0%
of the list I'd like to weigh in on that
 
01:45:05.430 --> 01:45:05.440 align:start position:0%
as well and that is
 
01:45:09.790 --> 01:45:09.800 align:start position:0%
that right now there is a ceiling on the
 
01:45:13.790 --> 01:45:13.800 align:start position:0%
charge for the checklist which is
 
01:45:17.669 --> 01:45:17.679 align:start position:0%
$25 and we have had uh at least in the
 
01:45:21.709 --> 01:45:21.719 align:start position:0%
last uh election we had charges of a
 
01:45:28.189 --> 01:45:28.199 align:start position:0%
dollar per uh page for the checklist and
 
01:45:30.070 --> 01:45:30.080 align:start position:0%
even in the excuse me not for the
 
01:45:32.830 --> 01:45:32.840 align:start position:0%
checklist for the absentee ballot list
 
01:45:35.870 --> 01:45:35.880 align:start position:0%
and even in the case of Grantham of all
 
01:45:41.910 --> 01:45:41.920 align:start position:0%
places um we had uh list that cost up to
 
01:45:44.830 --> 01:45:44.840 align:start position:0%
$58 because we were looking at the cost
 
01:45:48.589 --> 01:45:48.599 align:start position:0%
per page where if it were provided an
 
01:45:51.030 --> 01:45:51.040 align:start position:0%
ass sortable data file it would just be
 
01:45:52.109 --> 01:45:52.119 align:start position:0%
the same
 
01:45:52.119 --> 01:45:53.629 align:start position:0%
the same
price

01:45:53.629 --> 01:45:53.639 align:start position:0%
price
 
01:45:56.030 --> 01:45:56.040 align:start position:0%
regardless um so that would be really
 
01:45:57.470 --> 01:45:57.480 align:start position:0%
helpful if we could have some
 
01:46:00.189 --> 01:46:00.199 align:start position:0%
consistency there thank
 
01:46:02.830 --> 01:46:02.840 align:start position:0%
you thank you M Robinson any questions
 
01:46:06.990 --> 01:46:07.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:09.830 --> 01:46:09.840 align:start position:0%
Robinson I'm not seeing any questions so
 
01:46:11.550 --> 01:46:11.560 align:start position:0%
thank you for staying with us and
 
01:46:14.510 --> 01:46:14.520 align:start position:0%
joining us again my pleasure thank
 
01:46:19.189 --> 01:46:19.199 align:start position:0%
you HB 326 is in regards to electronic
 
01:46:22.070 --> 01:46:22.080 align:start position:0%
lists of absent to request persons is
 
01:46:23.750 --> 01:46:23.760 align:start position:0%
there anybody else in attendance who
 
01:46:27.030 --> 01:46:27.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:29.830 --> 01:46:29.840 align:start position:0%
bill I have a couple of
 
01:46:29.840 --> 01:46:31.430 align:start position:0%
bill I have a couple of
people

01:46:31.430 --> 01:46:31.440 align:start position:0%
people
 
01:46:34.430 --> 01:46:34.440 align:start position:0%
um representative Lane did you have a
 
01:46:35.990 --> 01:46:36.000 align:start position:0%
question and I missed
 
01:46:38.669 --> 01:46:38.679 align:start position:0%
it I have a general question I probably
 
01:46:42.589 --> 01:46:42.599 align:start position:0%
should have asked um the sponsors but my
 
01:46:44.709 --> 01:46:44.719 align:start position:0%
my question
 
01:46:47.830 --> 01:46:47.840 align:start position:0%
is I I'm going to show my ignorance here
 
01:46:49.910 --> 01:46:49.920 align:start position:0%
why do you need this list what what's
 
01:46:51.589 --> 01:46:51.599 align:start position:0%
the purpose purpose of getting the
 
01:46:59.790 --> 01:46:59.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:06.470 --> 01:47:06.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:09.750 --> 01:47:09.760 align:start position:0%
well is this better representative yes
 
01:47:11.629 --> 01:47:11.639 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:47:15.109 --> 01:47:15.119 align:start position:0%
so let's take 2020 for for an example
 
01:47:17.350 --> 01:47:17.360 align:start position:0%
where about 30% of the absentee ballots
 
01:47:21.109 --> 01:47:21.119 align:start position:0%
are cast in an election so
 
01:47:23.870 --> 01:47:23.880 align:start position:0%
in in 2020 alone uh because of the
 
01:47:25.870 --> 01:47:25.880 align:start position:0%
covid-19 changes in the election law
 
01:47:27.390 --> 01:47:27.400 align:start position:0%
voters were allowed to for the first
 
01:47:29.669 --> 01:47:29.679 align:start position:0%
time request vote the primary and
 
01:47:31.270 --> 01:47:31.280 align:start position:0%
general election abute ballot at the
 
01:47:34.510 --> 01:47:34.520 align:start position:0%
same time right so if you know that 30%
 
01:47:36.550 --> 01:47:36.560 align:start position:0%
of the ballots effectively in that
 
01:47:38.589 --> 01:47:38.599 align:start position:0%
election are going to go out within a
 
01:47:40.470 --> 01:47:40.480 align:start position:0%
week or two of the end of the primary
 
01:47:42.070 --> 01:47:42.080 align:start position:0%
you have to know to get to those voters
 
01:47:43.790 --> 01:47:43.800 align:start position:0%
quickly right because as candidates we
 
01:47:45.669 --> 01:47:45.679 align:start position:0%
want to be able to make our pitch say
 
01:47:48.350 --> 01:47:48.360 align:start position:0%
why you should vote for us right and I
 
01:47:50.310 --> 01:47:50.320 align:start position:0%
understand that there's provision where
 
01:47:52.270 --> 01:47:52.280 align:start position:0%
somebody sends in the M ballot they can
 
01:47:53.990 --> 01:47:54.000 align:start position:0%
show up to the polls on Election Day
 
01:47:55.910 --> 01:47:55.920 align:start position:0%
Before 6 a.m. to change it we all know
 
01:47:57.470 --> 01:47:57.480 align:start position:0%
no one does that we all know that that's
 
01:47:59.510 --> 01:47:59.520 align:start position:0%
just not a thing it's it's allowed but
 
01:48:00.790 --> 01:48:00.800 align:start position:0%
voters don't know they can do it and
 
01:48:03.550 --> 01:48:03.560 align:start position:0%
they flly don't exercise the right so
 
01:48:05.830 --> 01:48:05.840 align:start position:0%
when you're trying to convince voters to
 
01:48:07.790 --> 01:48:07.800 align:start position:0%
vote for you you need to know who's
 
01:48:09.390 --> 01:48:09.400 align:start position:0%
going to cast their vote and when and
 
01:48:10.910 --> 01:48:10.920 align:start position:0%
you know when people are casting their
 
01:48:12.510 --> 01:48:12.520 align:start position:0%
ballot you need to get to them early

a candidate last fall and I am in
 
01:49:25.070 --> 01:49:25.080 align:start position:0%
support of this bill I just wanted to
 
01:49:28.430 --> 01:49:28.440 align:start position:0%
give my uh a few of my experiences or my
 
01:49:31.390 --> 01:49:31.400 align:start position:0%
experience um last fall I did request
 
01:49:33.830 --> 01:49:33.840 align:start position:0%
the absentee ballot list from my town
 
01:49:35.229 --> 01:49:35.239 align:start position:0%
clerk which which was fine they were
 
01:49:38.149 --> 01:49:38.159 align:start position:0%
great getting it to me but my charge was
 
01:49:39.550 --> 01:49:39.560 align:start position:0%
a little bit more than the previous
 
01:49:43.189 --> 01:49:43.199 align:start position:0%
speaker I was charged a125 a page and in
 
01:49:45.629 --> 01:49:45.639 align:start position:0%
our pretty small town of Amhurst 56
 
01:49:50.189 --> 01:49:50.199 align:start position:0%
Pages came to $70 I believe so I I
 
01:49:51.430 --> 01:49:51.440 align:start position:0%
definitely would have preferred an
 
01:49:54.189 --> 01:49:54.199 align:start position:0%
electronic copy and not have to put out
 
01:49:56.790 --> 01:49:56.800 align:start position:0%
funds for that I was on a pretty limited
 
01:50:00.790 --> 01:50:00.800 align:start position:0%
budget for the um for the run for office
 
01:50:03.830 --> 01:50:03.840 align:start position:0%
and I I think you'll you'll see support
 
01:50:06.109 --> 01:50:06.119 align:start position:0%
all around from everyone that probably a
 
01:50:08.550 --> 01:50:08.560 align:start position:0%
cap on that or or if the elect if this
 
01:50:10.910 --> 01:50:10.920 align:start position:0%
bill passes electronic would be fine but
 
01:50:14.229 --> 01:50:14.239 align:start position:0%
maybe consider a cap on the cost of uh
 
01:50:16.589 --> 01:50:16.599 align:start position:0%
paper as
 
01:50:19.550 --> 01:50:19.560 align:start position:0%

for election law um this this bill is
 
01:59:09.149 --> 01:59:09.159 align:start position:0%
passed our committee last
 
01:59:13.669 --> 01:59:13.679 align:start position:0%
year 100% And it passed the house but
 
01:59:15.629 --> 01:59:15.639 align:start position:0%
then it died of covid before it could
 
01:59:18.669 --> 01:59:18.679 align:start position:0%
make it to the Senate so this is this
 
01:59:23.069 --> 01:59:23.079 align:start position:0%
bill is to make um um to make our
 
01:59:25.750 --> 01:59:25.760 align:start position:0%

multiple voting
 
01:59:33.950 --> 01:59:33.960 align:start position:0%
districts um because the current law
 
01:59:38.790 --> 01:59:38.800 align:start position:0%
makes it illegal to H uh to hire
 
01:59:42.470 --> 01:59:42.480 align:start position:0%
assistant moderators and assistant Town
 
01:59:46.069 --> 01:59:46.079 align:start position:0%

02:00:48.119 --> 02:00:50.270 align:start position:0%

02:00:50.270 --> 02:00:50.280 align:start position:0%

02:00:52.350 --> 02:00:52.360 align:start position:0%
questions from people attending
 
02:00:56.310 --> 02:00:56.320 align:start position:0%
online representative L yes thank you
 
02:01:00.550 --> 02:01:00.560 align:start position:0%
hello representative gay um I have a
 
02:01:04.270 --> 02:01:04.280 align:start position:0%
question about section two of the bill
 
02:01:06.910 --> 02:01:06.920 align:start position:0%
it says that each assistant moderator
 
02:01:09.149 --> 02:01:09.159 align:start position:0%
and assistant clerk shall have their
 
02:01:12.470 --> 02:01:12.480 align:start position:0%
domicile in the city Ward where they
 
02:01:16.109 --> 02:01:16.119 align:start position:0%
were served I wouldn't it be in the city
 
02:01:19.750 --> 02:01:19.760 align:start position:0%
where they live to make it equivalent to
 
02:01:21.550 --> 02:01:21.560 align:start position:0%
what the town is wouldn't it just be the
 
02:01:23.510 --> 02:01:23.520 align:start position:0%
city rather than the ward because I know
 
02:01:25.750 --> 02:01:25.760 align:start position:0%
I have a very small Ward and I know that
 
02:01:27.510 --> 02:01:27.520 align:start position:0%
our moderator has a problem getting
 
02:01:29.149 --> 02:01:29.159 align:start position:0%
people that live in the
 
02:01:31.470 --> 02:01:31.480 align:start position:0%
ward actually I'm gonna ask
 
02:01:33.669 --> 02:01:33.679 align:start position:0%
representative vergon to chime in on
 
02:01:38.350 --> 02:01:38.360 align:start position:0%
this given his uh experience in NASA
 
02:01:41.270 --> 02:01:41.280 align:start position:0%
because I have same thing occurred to me
 
02:01:43.950 --> 02:01:43.960 align:start position:0%
when I looked at it but I'm not
 
02:01:47.990 --> 02:01:48.000 align:start position:0%
pro um sure Madam chair be happy to um a
 
02:01:52.229 --> 02:01:52.239 align:start position:0%
City ward is a uh single voting district
 
02:01:55.310 --> 02:01:55.320 align:start position:0%
in the same way the town is uh as I
 
02:01:58.270 --> 02:01:58.280 align:start position:0%
interpreted this if a City ward wanted
 
02:02:00.589 --> 02:02:00.599 align:start position:0%
to have an additional polling place it
 
02:02:03.149 --> 02:02:03.159 align:start position:0%
could do so uh and then it would fall
 
02:02:05.310 --> 02:02:05.320 align:start position:0%
within the same kinds of guidelines and
 
02:02:07.709 --> 02:02:07.719 align:start position:0%
parameters that are being outlined for a
 
02:02:11.390 --> 02:02:11.400 align:start position:0%
town um in other words a an assistant
 
02:02:13.149 --> 02:02:13.159 align:start position:0%
moderator working at a second place
 
02:02:15.189 --> 02:02:15.199 align:start position:0%
within a ward is still a registered
 
02:02:18.430 --> 02:02:18.440 align:start position:0%
voter in that ward in the same way that
 
02:02:21.069 --> 02:02:21.079 align:start position:0%
they uh an assistant moderator in the
 
02:02:24.310 --> 02:02:24.320 align:start position:0%
town of uh Bedford uh was working at an
 
02:02:25.629 --> 02:02:25.639 align:start position:0%
additional place there's still a
 
02:02:28.510 --> 02:02:28.520 align:start position:0%
registered voter in the town of Bedford
 
02:02:30.709 --> 02:02:30.719 align:start position:0%
um so we we can't have I don't think we
 
02:02:33.229 --> 02:02:33.239 align:start position:0%
can have people moving uh out of one
 
02:02:35.030 --> 02:02:35.040 align:start position:0%
Ward to work in another they're they're
 
02:02:37.589 --> 02:02:37.599 align:start position:0%
essentially then moving from uh Bedford
 
02:02:39.430 --> 02:02:39.440 align:start position:0%
to Goffstown for example to help out the
 
02:02:41.390 --> 02:02:41.400 align:start position:0%
people in gtown I don't know if that
 
02:02:43.350 --> 02:02:43.360 align:start position:0%
that helps clarify anything but that's
 
02:02:46.629 --> 02:02:46.639 align:start position:0%
my understanding of of state
 
02:02:49.830 --> 02:02:49.840 align:start position:0%
law thank you for that clarification
 
02:02:52.270 --> 02:02:52.280 align:start position:0%

02:02:58.910 --> 02:02:58.920 align:start position:0%

set okay I finally finally was able to
 
02:27:10.389 --> 02:27:10.399 align:start position:0%
unmute greetings everybody thank you
 
02:27:17.269 --> 02:27:17.279 align:start position:0%
madam chair um it's a very very short uh
 
02:27:20.190 --> 02:27:20.200 align:start position:0%
a very short Bill requiring a person who
 
02:27:23.670 --> 02:27:23.680 align:start position:0%
registers to vote without identification
 
02:27:26.429 --> 02:27:26.439 align:start position:0%
has to have their photo made uh and this
 
02:27:29.190 --> 02:27:29.200 align:start position:0%
was inspired because we already know
 
02:27:32.910 --> 02:27:32.920 align:start position:0%
that if you're voting and you don't have
 
02:27:37.510 --> 02:27:37.520 align:start position:0%
uh a photo ID you can fill out the uh
 
02:27:39.990 --> 02:27:40.000 align:start position:0%
the same kind of affidavit that you can
 
02:27:44.230 --> 02:27:44.240 align:start position:0%
use to register to vote and uh then they
 
02:27:46.830 --> 02:27:46.840 align:start position:0%
want to take your picture but you can
 
02:27:49.389 --> 02:27:49.399 align:start position:0%
refuse if you can say with a straight
 
02:27:51.349 --> 02:27:51.359 align:start position:0%
face that it's against your
 
02:27:54.309 --> 02:27:54.319 align:start position:0%
religion and uh the reason this bill was
 
02:27:57.469 --> 02:27:57.479 align:start position:0%
submitted is that there is no current
 
02:28:00.469 --> 02:28:00.479 align:start position:0%
bill no current RS say right now that
 
02:28:05.710 --> 02:28:05.720 align:start position:0%
requires a photo if you register to vote
 
02:28:08.590 --> 02:28:08.600 align:start position:0%
with use by using
 
02:28:12.870 --> 02:28:12.880 align:start position:0%
affidavits um and so excuse me so this
 
02:28:15.190 --> 02:28:15.200 align:start position:0%
was for two reasons number one to say
 
02:28:17.910 --> 02:28:17.920 align:start position:0%
that you should have a photo
 
02:28:22.110 --> 02:28:22.120 align:start position:0%
and the other uh is to say well one is
 
02:28:25.150 --> 02:28:25.160 align:start position:0%
to say you that's part of the procedure
 
02:28:27.230 --> 02:28:27.240 align:start position:0%
but the other is to take away that
 
02:28:29.870 --> 02:28:29.880 align:start position:0%
option to say oh it's against my
 
02:28:32.670 --> 02:28:32.680 align:start position:0%
religion I'm sorry if it's against your
 
02:28:35.030 --> 02:28:35.040 align:start position:0%
religion bring in some kind of proof of
 
02:28:38.750 --> 02:28:38.760 align:start position:0%
who you are so um
 
02:28:42.309 --> 02:28:42.319 align:start position:0%
um I guess that's the simple as it is uh
 
02:28:45.230 --> 02:28:45.240 align:start position:0%
you can ask me questions to fill in the
 
02:28:47.790 --> 02:28:47.800 align:start position:0%
holes thank you representative gay are
 
02:28:50.510 --> 02:28:50.520 align:start position:0%
there members of the committee
 
02:28:50.520 --> 02:28:52.550 align:start position:0%
there members of the committee
here

02:28:52.550 --> 02:28:52.560 align:start position:0%
here
 
02:28:55.070 --> 02:28:55.080 align:start position:0%
who have questions members of the
 
02:29:02.349 --> 02:29:02.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:06.230 --> 02:29:06.240 align:start position:0%
remotely Madame chair may I say one more
 
02:29:08.910 --> 02:29:08.920 align:start position:0%
sentence Okay the reason that this is
 
02:29:14.389 --> 02:29:14.399 align:start position:0%
submitted is I was not aware but um I'm
 
02:29:17.990 --> 02:29:18.000 align:start position:0%
I met a new rep who was working at a
 
02:29:22.790 --> 02:29:22.800 align:start position:0%
poll in November and a a group of like
 
02:29:26.469 --> 02:29:26.479 align:start position:0%
college age people came in he said 20
 
02:29:29.349 --> 02:29:29.359 align:start position:0%
something that he did not recognize they
 
02:29:32.389 --> 02:29:32.399 align:start position:0%
came in as a group they said we want to
 
02:29:35.150 --> 02:29:35.160 align:start position:0%
register we don't have any ID none of
 
02:29:38.349 --> 02:29:38.359 align:start position:0%
them claimed to have any ID so they gave
 
02:29:40.309 --> 02:29:40.319 align:start position:0%
them the affidavits and then they said
 
02:29:44.670 --> 02:29:44.680 align:start position:0%
we're take your picture and they said oh
 
02:29:46.870 --> 02:29:46.880 align:start position:0%
no we don't want to have our picture
 
02:29:49.110 --> 02:29:49.120 align:start position:0%
made so they got to vote and
 
02:29:53.150 --> 02:29:53.160 align:start position:0%
leave and so when I talked with um I was
 
02:29:56.349 --> 02:29:56.359 align:start position:0%
checking out the validity of my bills so
 
02:29:59.230 --> 02:29:59.240 align:start position:0%
when I CH talked to Deputy scanland he
 
02:30:01.389 --> 02:30:01.399 align:start position:0%
said that should have been reported to
 
02:30:04.510 --> 02:30:04.520 align:start position:0%
us is he still here I'm
 
02:30:08.190 --> 02:30:08.200 align:start position:0%
hoping is Deputy scanland still here so
 
02:30:10.790 --> 02:30:10.800 align:start position:0%
anyway there there he is he's just not
 
02:30:12.750 --> 02:30:12.760 align:start position:0%
sitting in front of his computer so I
 
02:30:14.510 --> 02:30:14.520 align:start position:0%
would like to hear you know it would be
 
02:30:17.550 --> 02:30:17.560 align:start position:0%
helpful if he says explains this but
 
02:30:20.950 --> 02:30:20.960 align:start position:0%
that was my understanding that uh they
 
02:30:23.510 --> 02:30:23.520 align:start position:0%
sh they shouldn't have been permitted to
 
02:30:26.269 --> 02:30:26.279 align:start position:0%
do that but it's not in statute it's in
 
02:30:28.830 --> 02:30:28.840 align:start position:0%
statute that you take the picture when
 
02:30:32.230 --> 02:30:32.240 align:start position:0%
you're voting but not this just fills it
 
02:30:35.790 --> 02:30:35.800 align:start position:0%
in and says when you're registering so
 
02:30:39.389 --> 02:30:39.399 align:start position:0%

02:30:39.399 --> 02:30:40.630 align:start position:0%

02:31:29.950 --> 02:31:29.960 align:start position:0%

02:31:33.630 --> 02:31:33.640 align:start position:0%
that anecdote concerning the um 20-some
 
02:31:38.230 --> 02:31:38.240 align:start position:0%
so what town um or polling place uh did
 
02:31:41.269 --> 02:31:41.279 align:start position:0%
that um did that happen at and according
 
02:31:43.110 --> 02:31:43.120 align:start position:0%
to the representative who conveyed the
 
02:31:45.349 --> 02:31:45.359 align:start position:0%
story thank
 
02:31:45.359 --> 02:31:48.990 align:start position:0%
story thank

02:31:48.990 --> 02:31:49.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:52.150 --> 02:31:52.160 align:start position:0%
Madam chair go ahead representative G
 
02:31:55.590 --> 02:31:55.600 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I don't know I didn't I didn't
 
02:31:59.150 --> 02:31:59.160 align:start position:0%
ask him when he told us right Al I
 
02:32:00.750 --> 02:32:00.760 align:start position:0%
should have called him and asked him to
 
02:32:02.030 --> 02:32:02.040 align:start position:0%
call in
 
02:32:05.429 --> 02:32:05.439 align:start position:0%
today all right thank you um
 
02:32:08.429 --> 02:32:08.439 align:start position:0%
representative Veron yes thank you madam
 
02:32:11.230 --> 02:32:11.240 align:start position:0%
chairman representative gay welcome back
 
02:32:14.070 --> 02:32:14.080 align:start position:0%
um just a a quick question is is it your
 
02:32:16.750 --> 02:32:16.760 align:start position:0%
intention that this voter would have his
 
02:32:19.590 --> 02:32:19.600 align:start position:0%
or her photo taken twice once at the
 
02:32:22.110 --> 02:32:22.120 align:start position:0%
voter registration table then have to go
 
02:32:23.469 --> 02:32:23.479 align:start position:0%
through the process again at the
 
02:32:25.910 --> 02:32:25.920 align:start position:0%
checklist table or is it your intent
 
02:32:27.950 --> 02:32:27.960 align:start position:0%
that it's just done once but it's done
 
02:32:31.429 --> 02:32:31.439 align:start position:0%
at the voter registration uh table uh
 
02:32:34.590 --> 02:32:34.600 align:start position:0%
first or
 
02:32:38.269 --> 02:32:38.279 align:start position:0%
only well I wish I had thought of that
 
02:32:40.630 --> 02:32:40.640 align:start position:0%
um because it would be silly to take it
 
02:32:43.429 --> 02:32:43.439 align:start position:0%
take the picture twice but if they do
 
02:32:46.389 --> 02:32:46.399 align:start position:0%
have to attach the photo it's like polar
 
02:32:49.070 --> 02:32:49.080 align:start position:0%
Ides it's a different brand but I did
 
02:32:51.790 --> 02:32:51.800 align:start position:0%
learn that uh the state provided the
 
02:32:54.389 --> 02:32:54.399 align:start position:0%
cameras and that's what's in the FI they
 
02:32:58.590 --> 02:32:58.600 align:start position:0%
still have the cameras uh uh Deputy
 
02:33:01.550 --> 02:33:01.560 align:start position:0%
scandin did his best to figure to make a
 
02:33:03.950 --> 02:33:03.960 align:start position:0%
guess at how many they'd have to replace
 
02:33:06.790 --> 02:33:06.800 align:start position:0%
as well as the cost of the film um you
 
02:33:11.910 --> 02:33:11.920 align:start position:0%
do attach the picture to the document so
 
02:33:13.910 --> 02:33:13.920 align:start position:0%
for a person who is
 
02:33:17.750 --> 02:33:17.760 align:start position:0%
registering and then voting
 
02:33:20.389 --> 02:33:20.399 align:start position:0%
um I guess they would have to take the
 
02:33:22.990 --> 02:33:23.000 align:start position:0%
picture twice because there there would
 
02:33:24.550 --> 02:33:24.560 align:start position:0%
be two
 
02:33:27.190 --> 02:33:27.200 align:start position:0%
documents but that's not really my my
 
02:33:30.230 --> 02:33:30.240 align:start position:0%
field that's really a moderator
 
02:33:32.510 --> 02:33:32.520 align:start position:0%
question okay thank
 
02:33:39.550 --> 02:33:39.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:42.150 --> 02:33:42.160 align:start position:0%

02:34:04.670 --> 02:34:04.680 align:start position:0%
bit on the fiscal note um you know this
 
02:34:06.510 --> 02:34:06.520 align:start position:0%
pretty much reflects the cost of
 
02:34:09.429 --> 02:34:09.439 align:start position:0%
purchasing the cameras for the photo ID
 
02:34:12.830 --> 02:34:12.840 align:start position:0%
law that went into effect in
 
02:34:16.269 --> 02:34:16.279 align:start position:0%
2012 and uh that system once it was
 
02:34:19.870 --> 02:34:19.880 align:start position:0%
implemented uh worked really well to the
 
02:34:22.630 --> 02:34:22.640 align:start position:0%
point that uh you know very few voters
 
02:34:24.870 --> 02:34:24.880 align:start position:0%
going through the polling place without
 
02:34:27.030 --> 02:34:27.040 align:start position:0%
an acceptable form of ID end up having
 
02:34:29.510 --> 02:34:29.520 align:start position:0%
their photo taken because they they have
 
02:34:32.429 --> 02:34:32.439 align:start position:0%
an ID that that works for
 
02:34:35.269 --> 02:34:35.279 align:start position:0%
them the thinking with this legislation
 
02:34:37.429 --> 02:34:37.439 align:start position:0%
was that there would be more photos
 
02:34:40.550 --> 02:34:40.560 align:start position:0%
taken uh because of Voters that
 
02:34:42.790 --> 02:34:42.800 align:start position:0%
otherwise would fill out a qualified
 
02:34:44.590 --> 02:34:44.600 align:start position:0%
voter affidavit to prove
 
02:34:47.429 --> 02:34:47.439 align:start position:0%
identity um you're requiring a
 
02:34:52.230 --> 02:34:52.240 align:start position:0%
photograph being taken of them um and it
 
02:34:54.510 --> 02:34:54.520 align:start position:0%
would probably be easier at that point
 
02:34:55.910 --> 02:34:55.920 align:start position:0%
to have the photo taken at the
 
02:34:58.389 --> 02:34:58.399 align:start position:0%
registration table as opposed to a
 
02:35:03.150 --> 02:35:03.160 align:start position:0%
central place um uh you know where the
 
02:35:05.469 --> 02:35:05.479 align:start position:0%
voters are doing the same thing to
 
02:35:08.070 --> 02:35:08.080 align:start position:0%
obtain a ballot um because there would
 
02:35:10.110 --> 02:35:10.120 align:start position:0%
be more photos taken and there might be
 
02:35:12.429 --> 02:35:12.439 align:start position:0%
additional cameras needed in a polling
 
02:35:15.469 --> 02:35:15.479 align:start position:0%
place especially larger polling places
 
02:35:18.230 --> 02:35:18.240 align:start position:0%
um you know it may also shorten the life
 
02:35:21.070 --> 02:35:21.080 align:start position:0%
of the cameras that uh we purchased in
 
02:35:23.630 --> 02:35:23.640 align:start position:0%
2012 and you know they're they're now
 
02:35:26.790 --> 02:35:26.800 align:start position:0%
approaching a decade old and at some
 
02:35:28.269 --> 02:35:28.279 align:start position:0%
point are going to need to be replaced
 
02:35:31.670 --> 02:35:31.680 align:start position:0%
anyway so um I just want to say if the
 
02:35:33.070 --> 02:35:33.080 align:start position:0%
committee decides that this is
 
02:35:35.030 --> 02:35:35.040 align:start position:0%
appropriate uh you know I think it's
 
02:35:37.790 --> 02:35:37.800 align:start position:0%
doable um there will be a a minimal cost
 
02:35:40.750 --> 02:35:40.760 align:start position:0%
for additional cameras and um I'd be
 
02:35:43.990 --> 02:35:44.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:47.830 --> 02:35:47.840 align:start position:0%
questions questions forut scanland
 
02:35:49.950 --> 02:35:49.960 align:start position:0%
representative thank you madam
 
02:35:55.309 --> 02:35:55.319 align:start position:0%
chair uh Deputy scanland how many
 
02:35:59.429 --> 02:35:59.439 align:start position:0%
people um wanted a religious exemption
 
02:36:01.750 --> 02:36:01.760 align:start position:0%
in the last election that you're aware
 
02:36:04.070 --> 02:36:04.080 align:start position:0%
of they did not want their photograph
 
02:36:06.830 --> 02:36:06.840 align:start position:0%
taken because it was graveen
 
02:36:10.630 --> 02:36:10.640 align:start position:0%
image I don't have that number but I but
 
02:36:14.030 --> 02:36:14.040 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm sure it's a very low
 
02:36:17.070 --> 02:36:17.080 align:start position:0%
number follow up follow when you mean
 
02:36:19.269 --> 02:36:19.279 align:start position:0%
when you say low do you mean lower than
 
02:36:23.070 --> 02:36:23.080 align:start position:0%
a thousand 100 10 have a GU
 
02:36:23.080 --> 02:36:25.230 align:start position:0%
a thousand 100 10 have a GU
estimate

02:36:25.230 --> 02:36:25.240 align:start position:0%
estimate
 
02:36:28.429 --> 02:36:28.439 align:start position:0%
um just an educated guess you know I'd
 
02:36:31.590 --> 02:36:31.600 align:start position:0%
say it's less than a 100 um you know it
 
02:36:35.309 --> 02:36:35.319 align:start position:0%
less than it's just a fraction of 1% of
 
02:36:37.389 --> 02:36:37.399 align:start position:0%
Voters that need to have their photo
 
02:36:38.830 --> 02:36:38.840 align:start position:0%
taken because they don't have an
 
02:36:41.950 --> 02:36:41.960 align:start position:0%
acceptable form of ID and so those that
 
02:36:43.670 --> 02:36:43.680 align:start position:0%
are claiming the religious exemption
 
02:36:46.150 --> 02:36:46.160 align:start position:0%
would would be a fraction of that so
 
02:36:47.710 --> 02:36:47.720 align:start position:0%
it's a it's a number that certainly is
 
02:36:51.750 --> 02:36:51.760 align:start position:0%
less than 100 representative growan that
 
02:36:54.950 --> 02:36:54.960 align:start position:0%
answered my question M representative
 
02:36:57.630 --> 02:36:57.640 align:start position:0%
bar than SC thank you for being here
 
02:37:00.230 --> 02:37:00.240 align:start position:0%
today um the last time we testified on a
 
02:37:04.269 --> 02:37:04.279 align:start position:0%
bill about registering I asked you if a
 
02:37:06.309 --> 02:37:06.319 align:start position:0%
person who had been in the state for 30
 
02:37:07.870 --> 02:37:07.880 align:start position:0%
seconds could walk into the polling
 
02:37:10.830 --> 02:37:10.840 align:start position:0%
location present no ID no proof of down
 
02:37:13.469 --> 02:37:13.479 align:start position:0%
asile not have their picture taken and
 
02:37:16.110 --> 02:37:16.120 align:start position:0%
have their ballot passed and you
 
02:37:17.429 --> 02:37:17.439 align:start position:0%
explained that the answer to that
 
02:37:20.349 --> 02:37:20.359 align:start position:0%
question is is effectively yes right
 
02:37:20.359 --> 02:37:21.910 align:start position:0%
question is is effectively yes right
correct

02:37:21.910 --> 02:37:21.920 align:start position:0%
correct
 
02:37:25.550 --> 02:37:25.560 align:start position:0%
yes um would this bill in the opinion of
 
02:37:27.429 --> 02:37:27.439 align:start position:0%
secretary state's office at least move
 
02:37:30.870 --> 02:37:30.880 align:start position:0%
us an inch in the direction towards some
 
02:37:32.630 --> 02:37:32.640 align:start position:0%
voter Integrity measures because
 
02:37:34.710 --> 02:37:34.720 align:start position:0%
currently it is my understanding that we
 
02:37:40.710 --> 02:37:40.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:44.710 --> 02:37:44.720 align:start position:0%
country well this this is a balancing
 
02:37:47.309 --> 02:37:47.319 align:start position:0%
act and and The Balancing Act is making
 
02:37:50.910 --> 02:37:50.920 align:start position:0%
it easy for voters to vote but at the
 
02:37:53.510 --> 02:37:53.520 align:start position:0%
same time making sure that the voters
 
02:37:57.190 --> 02:37:57.200 align:start position:0%
that are voting are qualified to vote
 
02:37:59.830 --> 02:37:59.840 align:start position:0%
and so to the extent that you make the
 
02:38:02.710 --> 02:38:02.720 align:start position:0%
process easy um you know you may have to
 
02:38:05.590 --> 02:38:05.600 align:start position:0%
take some steps to be able to verify uh
 
02:38:08.550 --> 02:38:08.560 align:start position:0%
on the other end and I would see this as
 
02:38:11.389 --> 02:38:11.399 align:start position:0%
a tool uh you know to just
 
02:38:15.349 --> 02:38:15.359 align:start position:0%
verify uh in a process that um you know
 
02:38:18.630 --> 02:38:18.640 align:start position:0%
in New is fairly easy to
 
02:38:21.230 --> 02:38:21.240 align:start position:0%
do thank you representative Lane did I
 
02:38:25.710 --> 02:38:25.720 align:start position:0%
see you with the hand up yes I did
 
02:38:28.750 --> 02:38:28.760 align:start position:0%
um even though you're it's a balancing
 
02:38:32.630 --> 02:38:32.640 align:start position:0%
act at P scalin would you um say that
 
02:38:34.830 --> 02:38:34.840 align:start position:0%
there's rampant fraud or that we've seen
 
02:38:36.950 --> 02:38:36.960 align:start position:0%
any evidence of
 
02:38:36.960 --> 02:38:38.550 align:start position:0%
any evidence of
that

02:38:38.550 --> 02:38:38.560 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:38:41.469 --> 02:38:41.479 align:start position:0%
uh we know and as I mentioned in my
 
02:38:43.510 --> 02:38:43.520 align:start position:0%
earlier testimony today on another bill
 
02:38:46.269 --> 02:38:46.279 align:start position:0%
that there are isolated instances
 
02:38:48.070 --> 02:38:48.080 align:start position:0%
have been prosecuted recently by the
 
02:38:50.830 --> 02:38:50.840 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office where uh
 
02:38:54.469 --> 02:38:54.479 align:start position:0%
voters have uh exercised that right
 
02:38:58.389 --> 02:38:58.399 align:start position:0%
inappropriately and um and in some in
 
02:39:00.830 --> 02:39:00.840 align:start position:0%
instances they voted in you know more
 
02:39:03.150 --> 02:39:03.160 align:start position:0%
than one election have voted more than
 
02:39:05.710 --> 02:39:05.720 align:start position:0%
one time in the same election so we do
 
02:39:08.150 --> 02:39:08.160 align:start position:0%
know that it exists uh we do not have
 
02:39:11.110 --> 02:39:11.120 align:start position:0%
any evidence that there this is
 
02:39:14.030 --> 02:39:14.040 align:start position:0%
happening on a large scale or an
 
02:39:16.750 --> 02:39:16.760 align:start position:0%
organized scale
 
02:39:19.429 --> 02:39:19.439 align:start position:0%
okay thank you further questions from
 
02:39:21.429 --> 02:39:21.439 align:start position:0%
committee members representative to ro
 
02:39:22.710 --> 02:39:22.720 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you Deputy
 
02:39:24.870 --> 02:39:24.880 align:start position:0%
for taking the questions so in your
 
02:39:27.590 --> 02:39:27.600 align:start position:0%
opinion um if we were to enact this
 
02:39:30.870 --> 02:39:30.880 align:start position:0%
legislation would would taking a photo
 
02:39:33.269 --> 02:39:33.279 align:start position:0%
be helpful and reducing numbers of
 
02:39:35.110 --> 02:39:35.120 align:start position:0%
people that do
 
02:39:35.120 --> 02:39:39.429 align:start position:0%
people that do
this

02:39:39.429 --> 02:39:39.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:41.790 --> 02:39:41.800 align:start position:0%
inappropriately well I I I think it's a
 
02:39:43.910 --> 02:39:43.920 align:start position:0%
check on the system I I think if a if a
 
02:39:46.190 --> 02:39:46.200 align:start position:0%
photograph is required at the Reg
 
02:39:49.830 --> 02:39:49.840 align:start position:0%
rtion uh table or voters get used to the
 
02:39:51.190 --> 02:39:51.200 align:start position:0%
fact or know that they're going to have
 
02:39:54.150 --> 02:39:54.160 align:start position:0%
to provide some form of identification
 
02:39:57.790 --> 02:39:57.800 align:start position:0%
or have a photo taken um our experience
 
02:40:00.429 --> 02:40:00.439 align:start position:0%
with the voter ID to obtain a ballot has
 
02:40:02.910 --> 02:40:02.920 align:start position:0%
been that the voters seem to find the
 
02:40:04.870 --> 02:40:04.880 align:start position:0%
documentation that they
 
02:40:07.750 --> 02:40:07.760 align:start position:0%
need thank you thank you further
 
02:40:10.070 --> 02:40:10.080 align:start position:0%
questions for Deputy
 
02:40:13.469 --> 02:40:13.479 align:start position:0%
scan mam chair representative Sweeney
 
02:40:15.070 --> 02:40:15.080 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you deputy
 
02:40:17.150 --> 02:40:17.160 align:start position:0%
scandin for uh for being here with us
 
02:40:19.710 --> 02:40:19.720 align:start position:0%
and answering our questions uh last year
 
02:40:22.429 --> 02:40:22.439 align:start position:0%
it was uh it was made news that in 2016
 
02:40:24.150 --> 02:40:24.160 align:start position:0%
there was a gentleman from West Lebanon
 
02:40:26.510 --> 02:40:26.520 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire uh who had voted in the
 
02:40:29.710 --> 02:40:29.720 align:start position:0%
2016 presidential election uh left the
 
02:40:32.590 --> 02:40:32.600 align:start position:0%
poing location put on a wig in his car
 
02:40:33.910 --> 02:40:33.920 align:start position:0%
and then went back into the ploy
 
02:40:36.830 --> 02:40:36.840 align:start position:0%
location and voted under the identity of
 
02:40:40.269 --> 02:40:40.279 align:start position:0%
a of a female uh that he had by all
 
02:40:43.710 --> 02:40:43.720 align:start position:0%
accounts concocted up a life story for
 
02:40:46.469 --> 02:40:46.479 align:start position:0%
um if we had this P process in place
 
02:40:49.230 --> 02:40:49.240 align:start position:0%
during the 2016 election where when he
 
02:40:52.030 --> 02:40:52.040 align:start position:0%
went in to register as this new
 
02:40:53.750 --> 02:40:53.760 align:start position:0%
individual uh do you think would have
 
02:40:55.990 --> 02:40:56.000 align:start position:0%
been potential with the photograph that
 
02:40:58.990 --> 02:40:59.000 align:start position:0%
it wouldn't have taken four years to for
 
02:41:01.190 --> 02:41:01.200 align:start position:0%
the Attorney General's office to find
 
02:41:05.030 --> 02:41:05.040 align:start position:0%
and discover this this case of motor
 
02:41:08.070 --> 02:41:08.080 align:start position:0%
fraud uh yeah ver Sweeney I I don't know
 
02:41:09.950 --> 02:41:09.960 align:start position:0%
that I know the answer to that whether
 
02:41:12.349 --> 02:41:12.359 align:start position:0%
it would have taken any less time to
 
02:41:14.230 --> 02:41:14.240 align:start position:0%
come to that conclusion it's probably a
 
02:41:15.590 --> 02:41:15.600 align:start position:0%
better question asked the attorney
 
02:41:15.600 --> 02:41:16.990 align:start position:0%
better question asked the attorney
General's

02:41:16.990 --> 02:41:17.000 align:start position:0%
General's
 
02:41:20.429 --> 02:41:20.439 align:start position:0%
office thank you thank you further
 
02:41:23.550 --> 02:41:23.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:27.309 --> 02:41:27.319 align:start position:0%
members seeing none I'm going to close
 
02:41:30.830 --> 02:41:30.840 align:start position:0%

here will get it okay I will do that all
 
04:10:04.630 --> 04:10:04.640 align:start position:0%
right for a little break in the action
 
04:10:08.630 --> 04:10:08.640 align:start position:0%
um we should all have the blue
 
04:10:13.389 --> 04:10:13.399 align:start position:0%
2021 election law handbook I queried
 
04:10:16.910 --> 04:10:16.920 align:start position:0%
about a supplement for changes to the
 
04:10:19.469 --> 04:10:19.479 align:start position:0%
law because there are some things that
 
04:10:21.429 --> 04:10:21.439 align:start position:0%
are not in it and what they do in the
 
04:10:23.910 --> 04:10:23.920 align:start position:0%
off year is they print them in a sheet
 
04:10:25.830 --> 04:10:25.840 align:start position:0%
so that you have them to supplement your
 
04:10:28.469 --> 04:10:28.479 align:start position:0%
books they have just been delivered to
 
04:10:31.149 --> 04:10:31.159 align:start position:0%
the committee room and I have asked that
 
04:10:33.309 --> 04:10:33.319 align:start position:0%
they be email to everybody on the
 
04:10:35.910 --> 04:10:35.920 align:start position:0%
committee so if you're present you could
 
04:10:37.790 --> 04:10:37.800 align:start position:0%
pick up a paper copy if you want want
 
04:10:39.550 --> 04:10:39.560 align:start position:0%
but all committee members should be
 
04:10:43.070 --> 04:10:43.080 align:start position:0%
getting a copy and you would use that
 
04:10:46.910 --> 04:10:46.920 align:start position:0%
with your RSA book on Election laws it
 
04:10:50.030 --> 04:10:50.040 align:start position:0%
reflects the changes that were made from
 
04:10:52.349 --> 04:10:52.359 align:start position:0%
last year because I think if you've been
 
04:10:55.750 --> 04:10:55.760 align:start position:0%
watching a couple of the OS bills we
 
04:10:58.309 --> 04:10:58.319 align:start position:0%
have have modified a bill but if you go
 
04:11:00.630 --> 04:11:00.640 align:start position:0%
to the statute as printed it's not
 
04:11:04.030 --> 04:11:04.040 align:start position:0%
exactly the same and that's why so that
 
04:11:06.429 --> 04:11:06.439 align:start position:0%
was what that was all about so thank you
 
04:11:09.269 --> 04:11:09.279 align:start position:0%
for allowing me to interrupt to address
 
04:11:13.870 --> 04:11:13.880 align:start position:0%
that the next item is House Bill
 
04:11:17.790 --> 04:11:17.800 align:start position:0%
105 House Bill 105 is relative to
 
04:11:20.670 --> 04:11:20.680 align:start position:0%
political contributions by limited
 
04:11:20.680 --> 04:11:22.429 align:start position:0%
political contributions by limited
liability

04:11:22.429 --> 04:11:22.439 align:start position:0%
liability
 
04:11:26.469 --> 04:11:26.479 align:start position:0%
companies um is there a motion on House
 
04:11:28.910 --> 04:11:28.920 align:start position:0%
Bill HB
 
04:11:32.349 --> 04:11:32.359 align:start position:0%
105 yes Madam chair representative swee
 
04:11:35.429 --> 04:11:35.439 align:start position:0%
yes Madam chair I move that HB 105 as
 
04:11:38.309 --> 04:11:38.319 align:start position:0%
inexpedient to legisl
 
04:11:40.550 --> 04:11:40.560 align:start position:0%
is there a second I'll
 
04:11:45.429 --> 04:11:45.439 align:start position:0%
second so HB 105 has been moved to itl
 
04:11:47.790 --> 04:11:47.800 align:start position:0%
by representative Sweeny and it has been
 
04:11:50.630 --> 04:11:50.640 align:start position:0%
seconded by representative McDonald
 
04:11:52.229 --> 04:11:52.239 align:start position:0%
representative Sweeney would you like to
 
04:11:54.229 --> 04:11:54.239 align:start position:0%
speak to your motion yes thank you madam
 
04:11:56.229 --> 04:11:56.239 align:start position:0%
chair uh the state of New Hampshire does
 
04:11:58.550 --> 04:11:58.560 align:start position:0%
not track or list the membership of
 
04:12:00.830 --> 04:12:00.840 align:start position:0%
registered llc's and therefore this
 
04:12:03.269 --> 04:12:03.279 align:start position:0%
proposed change would not be enforcable
 
04:12:04.990 --> 04:12:05.000 align:start position:0%
further in numerous United States
 
04:12:06.590 --> 04:12:06.600 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court decisions campaign
 
04:12:08.950 --> 04:12:08.960 align:start position:0%
contributions have been seen as an act
 
04:12:10.910 --> 04:12:10.920 align:start position:0%
of free speech protected under the First
 
04:12:12.149 --> 04:12:12.159 align:start position:0%
Amendment of the United States
 
04:12:14.429 --> 04:12:14.439 align:start position:0%
Constitution therefore we as the house
 
04:12:15.830 --> 04:12:15.840 align:start position:0%
election law committee and as a
 
04:12:17.990 --> 04:12:18.000 align:start position:0%
legislative body should avoid placing
 
04:12:19.710 --> 04:12:19.720 align:start position:0%
any further limits on our current system
 
04:12:21.630 --> 04:12:21.640 align:start position:0%
of campaign finance and ensure that
 
04:12:24.670 --> 04:12:24.680 align:start position:0%
entities such as llc's can continue to
 
04:12:26.429 --> 04:12:26.439 align:start position:0%
practice their political autonomy and
 
04:12:29.429 --> 04:12:29.439 align:start position:0%
expression as currently
 
04:12:33.710 --> 04:12:33.720 align:start position:0%
allow thank you is there anyone else who

current Law requires any contribution
 
04:19:32.990 --> 04:19:33.000 align:start position:0%
above $25 to be reported this limit has

been in place since
 
04:19:37.469 --> 04:19:37.479 align:start position:0%
1984 the purpose of this legislation is
 
04:19:40.229 --> 04:19:40.239 align:start position:0%
to report potential Financial influence
 
04:19:42.710 --> 04:19:42.720 align:start position:0%
on elections I think we can all agree
 
04:19:45.070 --> 04:19:45.080 align:start position:0%
that in light of the funding levels of
 
04:19:47.870 --> 04:19:47.880 align:start position:0%
elections today a single or aggregate

contribution of1 does not represent
 
04:19:54.910 --> 04:19:54.920 align:start position:0%
undue influence on elections this bill
 
04:19:57.590 --> 04:19:57.600 align:start position:0%

there are so far going to be at least 11
 
04:24:02.469 --> 04:24:02.479 align:start position:0%
no votes on this because the the report

anything other than the chair's
 
04:24:11.070 --> 04:24:11.080 align:start position:0%
negligence scheduling and voting uh that
 
04:24:15.349 --> 04:24:15.359 align:start position:0%
would have any impact on this

04:26:42.550 --> 04:26:42.560 align:start position:0%
you madam
 
04:26:47.229 --> 04:26:47.239 align:start position:0%
chair a motion that House Bill 483 is in
 
04:26:50.990 --> 04:26:51.000 align:start position:0%
expedient legisl is there a
 
04:26:53.510 --> 04:26:53.520 align:start position:0%
second second the motion representative
 
04:26:56.590 --> 04:26:56.600 align:start position:0%
quy seconds the motion so the motion on
 
04:27:00.870 --> 04:27:00.880 align:start position:0%
the floor for 483 is inexpedient to
 
04:27:03.189 --> 04:27:03.199 align:start position:0%
legislate representative ter Roan would
 
04:27:05.030 --> 04:27:05.040 align:start position:0%
you like to speak to your motion yes
 
04:27:08.229 --> 04:27:08.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:11.349 --> 04:27:11.359 align:start position:0%
this bill for me was problematic is that
 
04:27:14.710 --> 04:27:14.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:17.710 --> 04:27:17.720 align:start position:0%
restricted candidate to be had in an
 
04:27:20.710 --> 04:27:20.720 align:start position:0%
inment from free speech on what or how
 
04:27:24.229 --> 04:27:24.239 align:start position:0%
he may have voted on some legislation so
 
04:27:26.189 --> 04:27:26.199 align:start position:0%
if this bill if we pass would violate
 
04:27:28.550 --> 04:27:28.560 align:start position:0%
the First Amendment right of a new
 
04:27:31.389 --> 04:27:31.399 align:start position:0%
candidate by not allowing them to say
 
04:27:33.710 --> 04:27:33.720 align:start position:0%
how they might have voted or would vote
 
04:27:36.910 --> 04:27:36.920 align:start position:0%
on an issue but another candidate that
 
04:27:40.429 --> 04:27:40.439 align:start position:0%
was an incumbent to have that right so
 
04:27:43.550 --> 04:27:43.560 align:start position:0%
would certainly create a unfair uneven
 
04:27:43.560 --> 04:27:47.950 align:start position:0%
would certainly create a unfair uneven
playing

04:27:47.950 --> 04:27:47.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:51.950 --> 04:27:51.960 align:start position:0%
fi so for that reason recomend
 
04:27:54.229 --> 04:27:54.239 align:start position:0%
vote legis
 
04:27:56.830 --> 04:27:56.840 align:start position:0%
thank anybody else like to speak to this
 
04:27:56.840 --> 04:27:58.710 align:start position:0%
thank anybody else like to speak to this
bill

04:27:58.710 --> 04:27:58.720 align:start position:0%
bill
 
04:28:01.149 --> 04:28:01.159 align:start position:0%
representative thank you uh I started
 
04:28:04.309 --> 04:28:04.319 align:start position:0%
off feeling very sympathetic to this
 
04:28:08.030 --> 04:28:08.040 align:start position:0%
bill um because in my own election I
 
04:28:10.950 --> 04:28:10.960 align:start position:0%
experienced a situation where um a
 
04:28:13.750 --> 04:28:13.760 align:start position:0%
letter was sent out full of inaccuracies
 
04:28:16.950 --> 04:28:16.960 align:start position:0%
about my own record and one of them for
 
04:28:18.870 --> 04:28:18.880 align:start position:0%
example was that I voted against Granite
 
04:28:20.710 --> 04:28:20.720 align:start position:0%
Hammer when I actually voted in favor of
 
04:28:23.870 --> 04:28:23.880 align:start position:0%
granite Hammer so I was sympathetic to
 
04:28:26.389 --> 04:28:26.399 align:start position:0%
this bill but people can check that
 
04:28:29.429 --> 04:28:29.439 align:start position:0%
record of mine and there were other
 
04:28:31.030 --> 04:28:31.040 align:start position:0%
things in here that they can't check
 
04:28:35.030 --> 04:28:35.040 align:start position:0%
that it's kind of crazy but um people
 
04:28:37.070 --> 04:28:37.080 align:start position:0%
could also call
 
04:28:40.109 --> 04:28:40.119 align:start position:0%
so they could check that uh with with
 
04:28:40.119 --> 04:28:42.070 align:start position:0%
so they could check that uh with with
this

04:28:42.070 --> 04:28:42.080 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:28:44.469 --> 04:28:44.479 align:start position:0%
situation they can make an assumption
 
04:28:46.229 --> 04:28:46.239 align:start position:0%
that because the person is not actually
 
04:28:48.389 --> 04:28:48.399 align:start position:0%
B in office you can't say how they would
 
04:28:49.750 --> 04:28:49.760 align:start position:0%
or would not
 
04:28:53.830 --> 04:28:53.840 align:start position:0%
vote um I agree that the First Amendment
 
04:28:57.429 --> 04:28:57.439 align:start position:0%
issues are are Paramount so I will be
 
04:29:02.870 --> 04:29:02.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:10.149 --> 04:29:10.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:12.790 --> 04:29:12.800 align:start position:0%
representative I want to thank sponsor
 
04:29:15.950 --> 04:29:15.960 align:start position:0%
Bo this well legislation um I think he
 
04:29:18.189 --> 04:29:18.199 align:start position:0%
makes extremely valid points about the
 
04:29:21.590 --> 04:29:21.600 align:start position:0%
way political advertisement is going and
 
04:29:24.109 --> 04:29:24.119 align:start position:0%
the lies that are told about people
 
04:29:25.510 --> 04:29:25.520 align:start position:0%
however there are serious First
 
04:29:28.910 --> 04:29:28.920 align:start position:0%
Amendment concerns so I will be voting
 
04:29:31.389 --> 04:29:31.399 align:start position:0%
down thank you is there anybody else
 
04:29:34.710 --> 04:29:34.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:37.910 --> 04:29:37.920 align:start position:0%
speak not see anything so there's a
 
04:29:42.429 --> 04:29:42.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:45.389 --> 04:29:45.399 align:start position:0%
43 recommend to the house that it be
 
04:29:48.469 --> 04:29:48.479 align:start position:0%
voted inexpedient to legislate to ask
 
04:29:50.910 --> 04:29:50.920 align:start position:0%
