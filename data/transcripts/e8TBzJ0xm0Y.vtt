about sections 21
23

and 28
 
00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:02.400 align:start position:0%
then i've asked uh mr ripple to prepare
 
00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:04.720 align:start position:0%
to give us sort of a little
 
00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:08.640 align:start position:0%

lapses
 
00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:11.760 align:start position:0%
because i've i've heard about it three
 
00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:14.480 align:start position:0%
or four times and i i think i have a
 
00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:17.040 align:start position:0%
general idea but i i need to hear it
 
00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:20.239 align:start position:0%
another time to be more clear on it
 
00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:21.909 align:start position:0%
another time to be more clear on it
um

00:04:21.909 --> 00:04:21.919 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:04:21.919 --> 00:04:22.790 align:start position:0%
um
we

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:22.800 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:23.749 align:start position:0%
we
uh

00:04:23.749 --> 00:04:23.759 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:04:25.909 --> 00:04:25.919 align:start position:0%
if we have time i'd like to continue
 
00:04:29.749 --> 00:04:29.759 align:start position:0%
having us talk about hb2 items
 
00:04:32.469 --> 00:04:32.479 align:start position:0%
uh we heard from the veterans home uh i
 
00:04:34.629 --> 00:04:34.639 align:start position:0%
believe it was sections
 
00:04:34.639 --> 00:04:35.830 align:start position:0%
believe it was sections
106

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:35.840 align:start position:0%
106
 
00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:38.000 align:start position:0%
107 108
 
00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:40.240 align:start position:0%
and we can we can just introduce those
 
00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:42.320 align:start position:0%
and and talk about them and see if uh
 
00:04:43.909 --> 00:04:43.919 align:start position:0%
what the general sense of the committee
 
00:04:46.629 --> 00:04:46.639 align:start position:0%
is relative to them
 
00:04:46.639 --> 00:04:47.749 align:start position:0%
is relative to them
um

00:04:47.749 --> 00:04:47.759 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:50.160 align:start position:0%
and then i i would like us
 
00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:54.880 align:start position:0%
to uh take sort of a focused
 
00:04:57.670 --> 00:04:57.680 align:start position:0%
re-dive around
 
00:04:59.830 --> 00:04:59.840 align:start position:0%

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:12.080 align:start position:0%
mmis and the county cap
 
00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:14.320 align:start position:0%
when we're talking about the county cap
 
00:05:16.469 --> 00:05:16.479 align:start position:0%
i want us to take a look
 
00:05:19.189 --> 00:05:19.199 align:start position:0%
at a word document that the governor's
 
00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:22.160 align:start position:0%
office shared with us yesterday evening
 
00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:24.240 align:start position:0%
showing what they project to be coming
 
00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:26.080 align:start position:0%
from the federal government and how it's
 
00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:28.320 align:start position:0%
going to be distributed in a way that
 
00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:31.680 align:start position:0%
bypasses the state to work completely
 
00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:34.720 align:start position:0%
and goes uh straight to counties uh
 
00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:36.880 align:start position:0%
cities and municipalities so we should
 
00:05:39.909 --> 00:05:39.919 align:start position:0%
be we should have such a situational
 
00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:42.320 align:start position:0%
awareness of of that money as we take a
 
00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:44.560 align:start position:0%
look at the county cap
 
00:05:47.029 --> 00:05:47.039 align:start position:0%
um so so that's
 
00:05:49.189 --> 00:05:49.199 align:start position:0%
that's what i think our agenda is for
 
00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:52.880 align:start position:0%
today uh one of our members uh has a
 
00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:54.880 align:start position:0%
medical appointment at three and needs
 
00:05:57.189 --> 00:05:57.199 align:start position:0%
to leave before that to get there
 
00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:00.000 align:start position:0%
so i'm i'm kind of hoping to be done
 
00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:03.520 align:start position:0%
uh around two ish 2 15 or so
 
00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:04.309 align:start position:0%
uh around two ish 2 15 or so
um

00:06:04.309 --> 00:06:04.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:06.240 align:start position:0%
and then uh
 
00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:08.160 align:start position:0%
that so that's kind of my plan
 
00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:10.000 align:start position:0%
representative nordgren
 
00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:12.400 align:start position:0%
oh yes uh could we please have our lunch
 
00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:15.840 align:start position:0%
break at 12 15 to 1 o'clock
 
00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:18.080 align:start position:0%
let's try for that i i don't see why we
 
00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:18.950 align:start position:0%
let's try for that i i don't see why we
couldn't

00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:18.960 align:start position:0%
couldn't
 
00:06:21.749 --> 00:06:21.759 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
00:06:23.029 --> 00:06:23.039 align:start position:0%
are there any other
 
00:06:25.909 --> 00:06:25.919 align:start position:0%
questions or comments about what we're
 
00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:28.720 align:start position:0%
why we're gathered here today
 
00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:29.350 align:start position:0%
why we're gathered here today
i

00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:29.360 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:32.000 align:start position:0%
i do want to do one more update um and
 
00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:32.950 align:start position:0%
i do want to do one more update um and
i'll

00:06:32.950 --> 00:06:32.960 align:start position:0%
i'll
 
00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:35.360 align:start position:0%
i'll bring you in mr uh representative
 
00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:36.560 align:start position:0%
weiler go ahead
 
00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:37.840 align:start position:0%
what do you
 
00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:39.520 align:start position:0%
what would you like to answer
 
00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:40.629 align:start position:0%
what would you like to answer
um

00:06:40.629 --> 00:06:40.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:06:42.629 --> 00:06:42.639 align:start position:0%
we were having that eight o'clock
 
00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:44.400 align:start position:0%
meeting with the governor this morning
 
00:06:47.029 --> 00:06:47.039 align:start position:0%
on this money that's coming in
 
00:06:48.390 --> 00:06:48.400 align:start position:0%
from this
 
00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:51.360 align:start position:0%
recovery act and it appears that it will
 
00:06:53.350 --> 00:06:53.360 align:start position:0%
all come through the state
 
00:06:55.990 --> 00:06:56.000 align:start position:0%
and in some cases uh some of the small
 
00:06:57.589 --> 00:06:57.599 align:start position:0%
towns and so on
 
00:06:59.830 --> 00:06:59.840 align:start position:0%
will just be kind of pulling it down
 
00:07:01.909 --> 00:07:01.919 align:start position:0%
because that way they they avoid the
 
00:07:04.070 --> 00:07:04.080 align:start position:0%
auditing and the accounting that the
 
00:07:06.469 --> 00:07:06.479 align:start position:0%
state would then have to do so
 
00:07:08.230 --> 00:07:08.240 align:start position:0%
it's liable to come through the state
 
00:07:09.350 --> 00:07:09.360 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:07:11.749 --> 00:07:11.759 align:start position:0%
uh so i i have a question for you on
 
00:07:15.350 --> 00:07:15.360 align:start position:0%
that is that just an administrative uh
 
00:07:17.430 --> 00:07:17.440 align:start position:0%
through though is it do we have the
 
00:07:20.790 --> 00:07:20.800 align:start position:0%
authority as a state to change um dollar
 
00:07:23.510 --> 00:07:23.520 align:start position:0%
amounts for any designated counties or
 
00:07:25.990 --> 00:07:26.000 align:start position:0%
designated municipalities
 
00:07:28.230 --> 00:07:28.240 align:start position:0%
or is it just administratively passed
 
00:07:30.230 --> 00:07:30.240 align:start position:0%
through us administratively passed
 
00:07:31.909 --> 00:07:31.919 align:start position:0%
through but of course the other warning
 
00:07:33.430 --> 00:07:33.440 align:start position:0%
is it's going to be a while before it's
 
00:07:35.430 --> 00:07:35.440 align:start position:0%
all there and it won't all come right
 
00:07:38.309 --> 00:07:38.319 align:start position:0%
away and you might get 50 of it at a
 
00:07:40.070 --> 00:07:40.080 align:start position:0%
time and it might
 
00:07:43.110 --> 00:07:43.120 align:start position:0%
go to the next year so
 
00:07:44.869 --> 00:07:44.879 align:start position:0%
don't get excited and spend it all at
 
00:07:46.390 --> 00:07:46.400 align:start position:0%
once kind of thing
 
00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:47.270 align:start position:0%
once kind of thing
okay

00:07:47.270 --> 00:07:47.280 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:07:49.589 --> 00:07:49.599 align:start position:0%
thank you for that and we'll we'll we'll
 
00:07:51.589 --> 00:07:51.599 align:start position:0%
come back to it and have a deeper talk
 
00:07:54.230 --> 00:07:54.240 align:start position:0%
uh representative wallner do you did you
 
00:07:57.110 --> 00:07:57.120 align:start position:0%
i think that i think uh
 
00:07:59.430 --> 00:07:59.440 align:start position:0%
chairman weiler just answered my
 
00:08:01.189 --> 00:08:01.199 align:start position:0%
question i guess
 
00:08:03.270 --> 00:08:03.280 align:start position:0%
my question was when do we think we're
 
00:08:04.390 --> 00:08:04.400 align:start position:0%
going to
 
00:08:07.430 --> 00:08:07.440 align:start position:0%
receive this uh money and it sounds like
 
00:08:09.830 --> 00:08:09.840 align:start position:0%
it's sort of up in the air
 
00:08:13.029 --> 00:08:13.039 align:start position:0%
yeah it may not be till the fall
 
00:08:13.039 --> 00:08:14.150 align:start position:0%
yeah it may not be till the fall
okay

00:08:14.150 --> 00:08:14.160 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:08:16.950 --> 00:08:16.960 align:start position:0%
and uh robert weiler do you know and i
 
00:08:19.029 --> 00:08:19.039 align:start position:0%
should i certainly could
 
00:08:21.029 --> 00:08:21.039 align:start position:0%
take a look at this myself but do you
 
00:08:23.189 --> 00:08:23.199 align:start position:0%
know if there's going to be
 
00:08:25.670 --> 00:08:25.680 align:start position:0%
like in that first um
 
00:08:27.110 --> 00:08:27.120 align:start position:0%
cares act
 
00:08:29.350 --> 00:08:29.360 align:start position:0%
there were timelines around when the
 
00:08:31.510 --> 00:08:31.520 align:start position:0%
money had to be spent
 
00:08:32.550 --> 00:08:32.560 align:start position:0%
is that
 
00:08:36.389 --> 00:08:36.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:39.430 --> 00:08:39.440 align:start position:0%
you know if that's going to be if if
 
00:08:41.909 --> 00:08:41.919 align:start position:0%
counties and towns and are going to have
 
00:08:45.110 --> 00:08:45.120 align:start position:0%
to expend the money by a certain date
 
00:08:47.430 --> 00:08:47.440 align:start position:0%
there was uh no information on that yet
 
00:08:48.949 --> 00:08:48.959 align:start position:0%
they're still waiting they think some of
 
00:08:50.710 --> 00:08:50.720 align:start position:0%
it may come through the treasury the
 
00:08:52.389 --> 00:08:52.399 align:start position:0%
treasury may be the ones making the
 
00:08:54.870 --> 00:08:54.880 align:start position:0%
rules so that's going to be a while
 
00:08:57.670 --> 00:08:57.680 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
00:09:00.710 --> 00:09:00.720 align:start position:0%
so just an update on on on that i i
 
00:09:02.310 --> 00:09:02.320 align:start position:0%
received uh
 
00:09:05.350 --> 00:09:05.360 align:start position:0%
naomi and i received our 2 800 overnight
 
00:09:07.190 --> 00:09:07.200 align:start position:0%
and it was a nice little
 
00:09:09.190 --> 00:09:09.200 align:start position:0%
christmas present this morning
 
00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:10.389 align:start position:0%
christmas present this morning
so

00:09:10.389 --> 00:09:10.399 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:09:12.470 --> 00:09:12.480 align:start position:0%
uh so some of the money's flowing
 
00:09:14.630 --> 00:09:14.640 align:start position:0%
through the system already
 
00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:15.750 align:start position:0%
through the system already
uh

00:09:15.750 --> 00:09:15.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:09:17.990 --> 00:09:18.000 align:start position:0%
mr ripple did you did you mean to say
 
00:09:19.910 --> 00:09:19.920 align:start position:0%

00:09:22.630 --> 00:09:22.640 align:start position:0%
i'm all set
 
00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:23.430 align:start position:0%
i'm all set
um

00:09:23.430 --> 00:09:23.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:09:24.710 --> 00:09:24.720 align:start position:0%
all right so
 
00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:25.910 align:start position:0%
all right so
um

00:09:25.910 --> 00:09:25.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:09:29.110 --> 00:09:29.120 align:start position:0%
to to to close out a conversation point
 
00:09:31.269 --> 00:09:31.279 align:start position:0%
that we had yesterday around whether or
 
00:09:33.269 --> 00:09:33.279 align:start position:0%
not we would post
 
00:09:38.550 --> 00:09:38.560 align:start position:0%
um our working document uh i i've i've
 
00:09:41.430 --> 00:09:41.440 align:start position:0%
with mr ripple's help and uh mr
 
00:09:44.550 --> 00:09:44.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:45.750 align:start position:0%
 
input

00:09:45.750 --> 00:09:45.760 align:start position:0%
input
 
00:09:47.829 --> 00:09:47.839 align:start position:0%
i've decided that we should just go
 
00:09:52.310 --> 00:09:52.320 align:start position:0%
ahead and post our working document
 
00:09:54.310 --> 00:09:54.320 align:start position:0%
i would like every
 
00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:55.590 align:start position:0%
i would like every
page

00:09:55.590 --> 00:09:55.600 align:start position:0%
page
 
00:09:57.750 --> 00:09:57.760 align:start position:0%
clearly marked
 
00:10:01.030 --> 00:10:01.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:03.750 --> 00:10:03.760 align:start position:0%
subject of frequent changes
 
00:10:05.509 --> 00:10:05.519 align:start position:0%
and our final
 
00:10:06.710 --> 00:10:06.720 align:start position:0%
is due
 
00:10:08.949 --> 00:10:08.959 align:start position:0%
24 march
 
00:10:11.509 --> 00:10:11.519 align:start position:0%
because i i'm still concerned that
 
00:10:13.910 --> 00:10:13.920 align:start position:0%
posting a working document that changes
 
00:10:15.670 --> 00:10:15.680 align:start position:0%
every few minutes
 
00:10:17.990 --> 00:10:18.000 align:start position:0%
is not good communication with the
 
00:10:20.069 --> 00:10:20.079 align:start position:0%
public it's going to be more confusing
 
00:10:20.079 --> 00:10:20.949 align:start position:0%
public it's going to be more confusing
so

00:10:20.949 --> 00:10:20.959 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:10:23.350 --> 00:10:23.360 align:start position:0%
i i just want that document when it's
 
00:10:25.829 --> 00:10:25.839 align:start position:0%
shared on the website to be properly
 
00:10:27.670 --> 00:10:27.680 align:start position:0%
disclaimed because
 
00:10:29.829 --> 00:10:29.839 align:start position:0%
it will immediately frighten people who
 
00:10:31.350 --> 00:10:31.360 align:start position:0%
think that uh
 
00:10:33.430 --> 00:10:33.440 align:start position:0%
who are concerned that their accounts
 
00:10:34.470 --> 00:10:34.480 align:start position:0%
will be
 
00:10:38.310 --> 00:10:38.320 align:start position:0%
uh diminished and um and that that is
 
00:10:40.550 --> 00:10:40.560 align:start position:0%
not the right way to view it
 
00:10:41.990 --> 00:10:42.000 align:start position:0%
so but
 
00:10:43.910 --> 00:10:43.920 align:start position:0%
we can't control how people will view
 
00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:44.949 align:start position:0%
we can't control how people will view
things

00:10:44.949 --> 00:10:44.959 align:start position:0%
things
 
00:10:47.670 --> 00:10:47.680 align:start position:0%
um with that
 
00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:49.509 align:start position:0%
um with that
i

00:10:49.509 --> 00:10:49.519 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:10:53.030 --> 00:10:53.040 align:start position:0%
think we're ready to talk about
 
00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:54.069 align:start position:0%
think we're ready to talk about
section

00:10:54.069 --> 00:10:54.079 align:start position:0%
section
 
00:10:54.079 --> 00:10:55.990 align:start position:0%
section
21.

00:10:55.990 --> 00:10:56.000 align:start position:0%
21.
 
00:10:57.670 --> 00:10:57.680 align:start position:0%
do you want to can are you ready to
 
00:10:59.509 --> 00:10:59.519 align:start position:0%
share it mr ripple can you put it up so
 
00:11:24.069 --> 00:11:24.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:26.230 --> 00:11:26.240 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:11:29.590 --> 00:11:29.600 align:start position:0%
okay so um i i think you all have looked
 
00:11:32.790 --> 00:11:32.800 align:start position:0%
at this a number of times this this is
 
00:11:35.829 --> 00:11:35.839 align:start position:0%
about um allowing authority
 
00:11:37.269 --> 00:11:37.279 align:start position:0%
uh for
 
00:11:39.910 --> 00:11:39.920 align:start position:0%
unfunded positions to be funded
 
00:11:43.190 --> 00:11:43.200 align:start position:0%
based on the availability of money
 
00:11:44.630 --> 00:11:44.640 align:start position:0%
and i think
 
00:11:47.030 --> 00:11:47.040 align:start position:0%
uh as i remember our discussion around
 
00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:48.150 align:start position:0%
uh as i remember our discussion around
this

00:11:48.150 --> 00:11:48.160 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:11:49.910 --> 00:11:49.920 align:start position:0%
representative weiler
 
00:11:52.550 --> 00:11:52.560 align:start position:0%
you had some thoughts on it and
 
00:11:56.470 --> 00:11:56.480 align:start position:0%
and i i i'd like to just verify that if
 
00:11:58.470 --> 00:11:58.480 align:start position:0%
if you have an amendment or whether you
 
00:12:01.269 --> 00:12:01.279 align:start position:0%
would like it this section dropped
 
00:12:02.870 --> 00:12:02.880 align:start position:0%
i'd like to know what you're thinking so
 
00:12:06.069 --> 00:12:06.079 align:start position:0%
that mr ripple can work on it
 
00:12:06.079 --> 00:12:07.430 align:start position:0%
that mr ripple can work on it
okay

00:12:07.430 --> 00:12:07.440 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:12:09.509 --> 00:12:09.519 align:start position:0%
this is similar to what we did in the
 
00:12:11.110 --> 00:12:11.120 align:start position:0%
previous budget
 
00:12:13.670 --> 00:12:13.680 align:start position:0%
but what we did was we said here's your
 
00:12:13.680 --> 00:12:14.550 align:start position:0%
but what we did was we said here's your
limit

00:12:14.550 --> 00:12:14.560 align:start position:0%
limit
 
00:12:16.629 --> 00:12:16.639 align:start position:0%
and i think we limited the number of
 
00:12:18.629 --> 00:12:18.639 align:start position:0%
employees as well
 
00:12:20.949 --> 00:12:20.959 align:start position:0%
and if they wanted if they had a couple
 
00:12:24.150 --> 00:12:24.160 align:start position:0%
of retirements or people resigning then
 
00:12:26.389 --> 00:12:26.399 align:start position:0%
that left gaps that they could fill with
 
00:12:29.030 --> 00:12:29.040 align:start position:0%
some positions that were unfunded at
 
00:12:31.670 --> 00:12:31.680 align:start position:0%
that moment but approved so
 
00:12:34.470 --> 00:12:34.480 align:start position:0%
this wouldn't change it that much
 
00:12:36.389 --> 00:12:36.399 align:start position:0%
according to what we put in the budget
 
00:12:39.670 --> 00:12:39.680 align:start position:0%
for positions so
 
00:12:41.509 --> 00:12:41.519 align:start position:0%
if we accepted this we'd still have
 
00:12:43.750 --> 00:12:43.760 align:start position:0%
control by how much
 
00:12:46.389 --> 00:12:46.399 align:start position:0%
money we put in class 10
 
00:12:48.069 --> 00:12:48.079 align:start position:0%
and so
 
00:12:48.079 --> 00:12:48.949 align:start position:0%
and so
it

00:12:48.949 --> 00:12:48.959 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:12:50.790 --> 00:12:50.800 align:start position:0%
it's kind of like what we did before
 
00:12:52.710 --> 00:12:52.720 align:start position:0%
it's a little more generous but
 
00:12:54.389 --> 00:12:54.399 align:start position:0%
we could probably stand it i don't know
 
00:12:58.710 --> 00:12:58.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:00.790 --> 00:13:00.800 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
00:13:03.190 --> 00:13:03.200 align:start position:0%
because i studied computer science i got
 
00:13:05.509 --> 00:13:05.519 align:start position:0%
to be really precise on this i'm sorry
 
00:13:07.750 --> 00:13:07.760 align:start position:0%
what i what i think i just heard you say
 
00:13:07.760 --> 00:13:08.710 align:start position:0%
what i what i think i just heard you say
is

00:13:08.710 --> 00:13:08.720 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:13:10.470 --> 00:13:10.480 align:start position:0%
you you have no
 
00:13:13.670 --> 00:13:13.680 align:start position:0%
recommended changes to section 21 that
 
00:13:15.509 --> 00:13:15.519 align:start position:0%
you would accept that word for word
 
00:13:17.269 --> 00:13:17.279 align:start position:0%
comma for comma
 
00:13:17.279 --> 00:13:22.949 align:start position:0%
comma for comma
correct

00:13:22.949 --> 00:13:22.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:25.030 --> 00:13:25.040 align:start position:0%
is there is there any other
 
00:13:25.040 --> 00:13:26.230 align:start position:0%
is there is there any other
committee

00:13:26.230 --> 00:13:26.240 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:13:34.150 --> 00:13:34.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:37.910 --> 00:13:37.920 align:start position:0%
i'm not seeing any um
 
00:13:39.590 --> 00:13:39.600 align:start position:0%
for the public
 
00:13:41.750 --> 00:13:41.760 align:start position:0%
the way i would like to do this is to
 
00:13:43.590 --> 00:13:43.600 align:start position:0%
get through all of the sections that we
 
00:13:45.590 --> 00:13:45.600 align:start position:0%
plan on talking today
 
00:13:47.030 --> 00:13:47.040 align:start position:0%
about today
 
00:13:49.030 --> 00:13:49.040 align:start position:0%
if you if you want to speak on any of
 
00:13:51.910 --> 00:13:51.920 align:start position:0%
these sections we'll entertain questions
 
00:13:54.069 --> 00:13:54.079 align:start position:0%
about what we've discussed
 
00:13:57.910 --> 00:13:57.920 align:start position:0%
uh before uh we take any votes so
 
00:13:57.920 --> 00:13:58.949 align:start position:0%
uh before uh we take any votes so
um

00:13:58.949 --> 00:13:58.959 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:14:01.350 --> 00:14:01.360 align:start position:0%
did you have a question representative
 
00:14:04.550 --> 00:14:04.560 align:start position:0%
you went for your screen
 
00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:06.949 align:start position:0%
you went for your screen
no

00:14:06.949 --> 00:14:06.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:09.750 --> 00:14:09.760 align:start position:0%
no i'm i'm i'm fine with this section
 
00:14:11.430 --> 00:14:11.440 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
00:14:25.189 --> 00:14:25.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:27.189 --> 00:14:27.199 align:start position:0%
go ahead represent walter it sounds like
 
00:14:28.470 --> 00:14:28.480 align:start position:0%
you do have something you might want
 
00:14:30.310 --> 00:14:30.320 align:start position:0%
well no i just wondered are we going to
 
00:14:33.430 --> 00:14:33.440 align:start position:0%
vote on these as we go along or
 
00:14:36.470 --> 00:14:36.480 align:start position:0%
i i think uh if uh i'm going to try
 
00:14:38.069 --> 00:14:38.079 align:start position:0%
something different i'm going to try a
 
00:14:41.269 --> 00:14:41.279 align:start position:0%
block vote at the end if we have
 
00:14:43.030 --> 00:14:43.040 align:start position:0%
you know what seems to be strong
 
00:14:44.790 --> 00:14:44.800 align:start position:0%
agreement on all of them
 
00:14:46.870 --> 00:14:46.880 align:start position:0%
so like for example the one we just
 
00:14:48.310 --> 00:14:48.320 align:start position:0%
talked about
 
00:14:50.710 --> 00:14:50.720 align:start position:0%
i might couple it with two or three
 
00:14:53.189 --> 00:14:53.199 align:start position:0%
other ones if we if nobody's voicing any
 
00:14:54.949 --> 00:14:54.959 align:start position:0%
concerns about them
 
00:14:57.750 --> 00:14:57.760 align:start position:0%
so i'm trying to figure out ways
 
00:15:00.870 --> 00:15:00.880 align:start position:0%
to to have our votes and and be a little
 
00:15:03.430 --> 00:15:03.440 align:start position:0%
quicker about about it
 
00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:05.350 align:start position:0%
quicker about about it
um

00:15:05.350 --> 00:15:05.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:06.230 align:start position:0%
um
okay

00:15:06.230 --> 00:15:06.240 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:15:10.550 --> 00:15:10.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:12.870 --> 00:15:12.880 align:start position:0%
section 23.
 
00:15:14.629 --> 00:15:14.639 align:start position:0%
uh this is uh
 
00:15:14.639 --> 00:15:15.590 align:start position:0%
uh this is uh
about

00:15:15.590 --> 00:15:15.600 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:17.030 align:start position:0%
about
allowing

00:15:17.030 --> 00:15:17.040 align:start position:0%
allowing
 
00:15:18.710 --> 00:15:18.720 align:start position:0%
the the
 
00:15:20.069 --> 00:15:20.079 align:start position:0%
the colas
 
00:15:23.750 --> 00:15:23.760 align:start position:0%
to increase eligibility levels
 
00:15:24.870 --> 00:15:24.880 align:start position:0%
so that
 
00:15:27.030 --> 00:15:27.040 align:start position:0%
uh people don't
 
00:15:30.230 --> 00:15:30.240 align:start position:0%
fall out of eligibility due to a cost of
 
00:15:32.310 --> 00:15:32.320 align:start position:0%
living adjustment
 
00:15:35.910 --> 00:15:35.920 align:start position:0%
so um i think as i remember my notes on
 
00:15:35.920 --> 00:15:37.590 align:start position:0%
so um i think as i remember my notes on
this

00:15:37.590 --> 00:15:37.600 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:15:40.550 --> 00:15:40.560 align:start position:0%
this this is something that may actually
 
00:15:42.870 --> 00:15:42.880 align:start position:0%
be required by federal law for us to
 
00:15:45.590 --> 00:15:45.600 align:start position:0%
continue receiving some federal funds
 
00:15:48.710 --> 00:15:48.720 align:start position:0%
is does anyone have any further
 
00:15:51.509 --> 00:15:51.519 align:start position:0%
con and my conclusion is i'm i think i'm
 
00:15:54.310 --> 00:15:54.320 align:start position:0%
fine with section 23.
 
00:15:56.949 --> 00:15:56.959 align:start position:0%
but i want to hear from anyone who may
 
00:15:59.829 --> 00:15:59.839 align:start position:0%
have uh other information or other
 
00:15:59.839 --> 00:16:03.110 align:start position:0%
have uh other information or other
viewpoints

00:16:03.110 --> 00:16:03.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:06.790 --> 00:16:06.800 align:start position:0%
i think i'd ask uh mr ripple if this is
 
00:16:09.269 --> 00:16:09.279 align:start position:0%
in there on a routine basis i think it
 
00:16:09.279 --> 00:16:11.030 align:start position:0%
in there on a routine basis i think it
is

00:16:11.030 --> 00:16:11.040 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:16:12.629 --> 00:16:12.639 align:start position:0%
it is it's definitely in the current
 
00:16:15.350 --> 00:16:15.360 align:start position:0%
2021 trailer bill um
 
00:16:16.949 --> 00:16:16.959 align:start position:0%
i have to go back further than that but
 
00:16:18.310 --> 00:16:18.320 align:start position:0%
i think it's been in for the past
 
00:16:21.189 --> 00:16:21.199 align:start position:0%
several bills yes yeah
 
00:16:23.829 --> 00:16:23.839 align:start position:0%
out of curiosity oh i see karen rounds
 
00:16:25.590 --> 00:16:25.600 align:start position:0%
on there too
 
00:16:27.590 --> 00:16:27.600 align:start position:0%
at some point we might just pull her in
 
00:16:31.189 --> 00:16:31.199 align:start position:0%
as a panelist um okay
 
00:16:33.110 --> 00:16:33.120 align:start position:0%
do you want me to do that now
 
00:16:34.870 --> 00:16:34.880 align:start position:0%
i think it's fine
 
00:16:37.030 --> 00:16:37.040 align:start position:0%
i think i think we may end up with a
 
00:16:42.310 --> 00:16:42.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:47.670 --> 00:16:47.680 align:start position:0%
now section 24 county reimbursement
 
00:16:50.230 --> 00:16:50.240 align:start position:0%
this is this is a lot on the county cap
 
00:16:52.870 --> 00:16:52.880 align:start position:0%
area this i think we need to talk about
 
00:16:55.110 --> 00:16:55.120 align:start position:0%
this in conjunction
 
00:16:55.120 --> 00:16:56.150 align:start position:0%
this in conjunction
with

00:16:56.150 --> 00:16:56.160 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:16:56.160 --> 00:16:57.110 align:start position:0%
with
um

00:16:57.110 --> 00:16:57.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:59.990 --> 00:17:00.000 align:start position:0%
the federal money that's coming down
 
00:17:03.269 --> 00:17:03.279 align:start position:0%
so uh i would i would like to defer 24 a
 
00:17:04.470 --> 00:17:04.480 align:start position:0%
little bit
 
00:17:06.549 --> 00:17:06.559 align:start position:0%
so that we can knock out some of these
 
00:17:09.029 --> 00:17:09.039 align:start position:0%
other sections that may be uh
 
00:17:10.470 --> 00:17:10.480 align:start position:0%
more approachable
 
00:17:10.480 --> 00:17:11.429 align:start position:0%
more approachable
so

00:17:11.429 --> 00:17:11.439 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:17:15.189 --> 00:17:15.199 align:start position:0%
so we're going to come back to 24
 
00:17:17.829 --> 00:17:17.839 align:start position:0%
but let's let's for a moment go to
 
00:17:23.270 --> 00:17:23.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:23.280 --> 00:17:24.150 align:start position:0%
 
now

00:17:24.150 --> 00:17:24.160 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:17:26.949 --> 00:17:26.959 align:start position:0%
my notes on section 25
 
00:17:26.959 --> 00:17:28.630 align:start position:0%
my notes on section 25
uh

00:17:28.630 --> 00:17:28.640 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:17:31.590 --> 00:17:31.600 align:start position:0%
had had me a little bit confused what i
 
00:17:35.669 --> 00:17:35.679 align:start position:0%
think section 25 the effect of 25 is
 
00:17:38.390 --> 00:17:38.400 align:start position:0%
is if we ex accept
 
00:17:40.230 --> 00:17:40.240 align:start position:0%
the uh amendment
 
00:17:42.630 --> 00:17:42.640 align:start position:0%
from 2023
 
00:17:46.310 --> 00:17:46.320 align:start position:0%
22 from 2021 to 2023
 
00:17:48.230 --> 00:17:48.240 align:start position:0%
that that we will
 
00:17:51.029 --> 00:17:51.039 align:start position:0%
continue a trend that started in around
 
00:17:51.039 --> 00:17:53.190 align:start position:0%
continue a trend that started in around
2011

00:17:53.190 --> 00:17:53.200 align:start position:0%
2011
 
00:17:56.549 --> 00:17:56.559 align:start position:0%
and and that this in effect saves the
 
00:17:58.310 --> 00:17:58.320 align:start position:0%
state some money
 
00:18:00.950 --> 00:18:00.960 align:start position:0%
and if we decided to quit doing this we
 
00:18:02.789 --> 00:18:02.799 align:start position:0%
would have to find some money to put
 
00:18:05.270 --> 00:18:05.280 align:start position:0%
into one of our activity codes i think
 
00:18:07.430 --> 00:18:07.440 align:start position:0%
that's the background on this does
 
00:18:08.630 --> 00:18:08.640 align:start position:0%
anyone have
 
00:18:11.190 --> 00:18:11.200 align:start position:0%
uh any comments if the committee doesn't
 
00:18:13.350 --> 00:18:13.360 align:start position:0%
have any comments this is one i'd like
 
00:18:15.830 --> 00:18:15.840 align:start position:0%
to just hear from uh either mr ripple or
 
00:18:17.110 --> 00:18:17.120 align:start position:0%
ms rounds
 
00:18:19.430 --> 00:18:19.440 align:start position:0%
on to to make sure that uh
 
00:18:21.190 --> 00:18:21.200 align:start position:0%
we're clear on the
 
00:18:23.430 --> 00:18:23.440 align:start position:0%
effect of this
 
00:18:25.270 --> 00:18:25.280 align:start position:0%
uh before we do that
 
00:18:26.549 --> 00:18:26.559 align:start position:0%
representative wallner do you want to
 
00:18:29.029 --> 00:18:29.039 align:start position:0%
let this round speak first and then and
 
00:18:31.510 --> 00:18:31.520 align:start position:0%
then you ask okay that's what that's
 
00:18:33.029 --> 00:18:33.039 align:start position:0%
what i was that's what i was going to
 
00:18:34.950 --> 00:18:34.960 align:start position:0%
ask you to do bring up karen to talk
 
00:18:36.390 --> 00:18:36.400 align:start position:0%
about this section
 
00:18:37.350 --> 00:18:37.360 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:18:40.310 --> 00:18:40.320 align:start position:0%
yes ma'am um ms rounds
 
00:18:42.950 --> 00:18:42.960 align:start position:0%
good morning so i'm just looking at the
 
00:18:45.110 --> 00:18:45.120 align:start position:0%
notes that uh john williams provided to
 
00:18:46.230 --> 00:18:46.240 align:start position:0%
me so
 
00:18:49.590 --> 00:18:49.600 align:start position:0%
um i do know that he did provide me some
 
00:18:51.590 --> 00:18:51.600 align:start position:0%
language um
 
00:18:55.590 --> 00:18:55.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:59.430 --> 00:18:59.440 align:start position:0%
putting off the repeal since 2011
 
00:18:59.440 --> 00:19:00.470 align:start position:0%
putting off the repeal since 2011
so

00:19:00.470 --> 00:19:00.480 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:19:02.150 --> 00:19:02.160 align:start position:0%
he did provide me with language to
 
00:19:04.150 --> 00:19:04.160 align:start position:0%
repeal the repeal so this would no
 
00:19:06.630 --> 00:19:06.640 align:start position:0%
longer need to be in every trailer bill
 
00:19:08.230 --> 00:19:08.240 align:start position:0%
um if that's something the committee's
 
00:19:13.510 --> 00:19:13.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:15.350 --> 00:19:15.360 align:start position:0%
and i'm just hold on just one second i
 
00:19:16.710 --> 00:19:16.720 align:start position:0%
just want to make sure that i say this
 
00:19:16.720 --> 00:19:26.870 align:start position:0%
just want to make sure that i say this
correctly

00:19:26.870 --> 00:19:26.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:28.310 --> 00:19:28.320 align:start position:0%
yeah so the
 
00:19:31.110 --> 00:19:31.120 align:start position:0%
hb 191 which was the original law for
 
00:19:33.830 --> 00:19:33.840 align:start position:0%
this apparently um
 
00:19:37.270 --> 00:19:37.280 align:start position:0%
allowed cmhcs to prioritize delivery of
 
00:19:39.430 --> 00:19:39.440 align:start position:0%
services based on an individual's
 
00:19:41.430 --> 00:19:41.440 align:start position:0%
clinical needs essentially allowing for
 
00:19:42.630 --> 00:19:42.640 align:start position:0%
a wait list
 
00:19:45.110 --> 00:19:45.120 align:start position:0%
that has not been needed and there's not
 
00:19:47.669 --> 00:19:47.679 align:start position:0%
been a wait list so
 
00:19:51.669 --> 00:19:51.679 align:start position:0%
we continue to hold off on this
 
00:19:53.430 --> 00:19:53.440 align:start position:0%
on this because of that that it's been
 
00:19:55.190 --> 00:19:55.200 align:start position:0%
properly funded and there's not been an
 
00:19:57.909 --> 00:19:57.919 align:start position:0%
issue so i i think it's fine to leave it
 
00:19:59.510 --> 00:19:59.520 align:start position:0%
the way it is but if we want to stop
 
00:20:01.750 --> 00:20:01.760 align:start position:0%
putting in hb2 year after year it's been
 
00:20:03.909 --> 00:20:03.919 align:start position:0%
10 years and we've kept it the same we
 
00:20:03.919 --> 00:20:05.029 align:start position:0%
10 years and we've kept it the same we
can

00:20:05.029 --> 00:20:05.039 align:start position:0%
can
 
00:20:07.750 --> 00:20:07.760 align:start position:0%
do something to eliminate it completely
 
00:20:09.590 --> 00:20:09.600 align:start position:0%
all right representative i i have a
 
00:20:11.909 --> 00:20:11.919 align:start position:0%
question for you on there but i i see mr
 
00:20:13.590 --> 00:20:13.600 align:start position:0%
or excuse me representative weiler's
 
00:20:15.750 --> 00:20:15.760 align:start position:0%
hand is up and i know representative may
 
00:20:17.110 --> 00:20:17.120 align:start position:0%
have a question
 
00:20:19.270 --> 00:20:19.280 align:start position:0%
representative weiler thank you mr
 
00:20:20.549 --> 00:20:20.559 align:start position:0%
chairman so
 
00:20:21.909 --> 00:20:21.919 align:start position:0%
if we did
 
00:20:24.549 --> 00:20:24.559 align:start position:0%
have uh more people coming becoming
 
00:20:26.390 --> 00:20:26.400 align:start position:0%
eligible than we had funds for we'd
 
00:20:28.789 --> 00:20:28.799 align:start position:0%
still have to go to a waiting list so
 
00:20:31.830 --> 00:20:31.840 align:start position:0%
maybe we shouldn't eliminate um this if
 
00:20:37.669 --> 00:20:37.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:37.679 --> 00:20:38.630 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:20:38.630 --> 00:20:38.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:20:40.470 --> 00:20:40.480 align:start position:0%
quick quick question
 
00:20:42.149 --> 00:20:42.159 align:start position:0%
yes all right do you mind if we bring
 
00:20:43.830 --> 00:20:43.840 align:start position:0%
katya over
 
00:20:45.510 --> 00:20:45.520 align:start position:0%
she uh katy is the director for
 
00:20:46.950 --> 00:20:46.960 align:start position:0%
behavioral health she can probably give
 
00:20:48.789 --> 00:20:48.799 align:start position:0%
you a more in-depth explanation than i
 
00:20:48.799 --> 00:20:50.070 align:start position:0%
you a more in-depth explanation than i
can

00:20:50.070 --> 00:20:50.080 align:start position:0%
can
 
00:20:52.230 --> 00:20:52.240 align:start position:0%
okay this is bigger than behavioral
 
00:20:53.750 --> 00:20:53.760 align:start position:0%
health though isn't it this is the whole
 
00:20:55.909 --> 00:20:55.919 align:start position:0%
medicaid program isn't it
 
00:20:58.230 --> 00:20:58.240 align:start position:0%
um it is but conti is familiar with the
 
00:21:01.830 --> 00:21:01.840 align:start position:0%
behavioral health pieces of the medicaid
 
00:21:04.470 --> 00:21:04.480 align:start position:0%
performance fox speaks i i think we got
 
00:21:06.230 --> 00:21:06.240 align:start position:0%
to put a couple more things out on the
 
00:21:08.710 --> 00:21:08.720 align:start position:0%
table uh representative weiler your hand
 
00:21:10.950 --> 00:21:10.960 align:start position:0%
is still up okay representative did you
 
00:21:12.310 --> 00:21:12.320 align:start position:0%
have something
 
00:21:13.990 --> 00:21:14.000 align:start position:0%
no but i would like to hear from miss
 
00:21:17.190 --> 00:21:17.200 align:start position:0%
fox for sure about this one okay so the
 
00:21:19.430 --> 00:21:19.440 align:start position:0%
idea of uh
 
00:21:22.070 --> 00:21:22.080 align:start position:0%
of having a wait list
 
00:21:24.549 --> 00:21:24.559 align:start position:0%
um it can be called different sorts of
 
00:21:28.230 --> 00:21:28.240 align:start position:0%
things but oregon implemented
 
00:21:28.240 --> 00:21:29.350 align:start position:0%
things but oregon implemented
a

00:21:29.350 --> 00:21:29.360 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:21:32.470 --> 00:21:32.480 align:start position:0%
system several many many years ago it
 
00:21:34.549 --> 00:21:34.559 align:start position:0%
could well over a decade
 
00:21:34.559 --> 00:21:35.350 align:start position:0%
could well over a decade
where

00:21:35.350 --> 00:21:35.360 align:start position:0%
where
 
00:21:36.549 --> 00:21:36.559 align:start position:0%
um they
 
00:21:38.470 --> 00:21:38.480 align:start position:0%
racked and stacked
 
00:21:41.190 --> 00:21:41.200 align:start position:0%
all of the drgs
 
00:21:44.710 --> 00:21:44.720 align:start position:0%
uh that medicaid was paying for from the
 
00:21:44.720 --> 00:21:45.590 align:start position:0%
uh that medicaid was paying for from the
most

00:21:45.590 --> 00:21:45.600 align:start position:0%
most
 
00:21:48.230 --> 00:21:48.240 align:start position:0%
clinically useful to the least
 
00:21:50.549 --> 00:21:50.559 align:start position:0%
clinically effective
 
00:21:53.590 --> 00:21:53.600 align:start position:0%
and so if they ever ran into a shortage
 
00:21:54.710 --> 00:21:54.720 align:start position:0%
of money
 
00:21:58.029 --> 00:21:58.039 align:start position:0%
they would use that list to start
 
00:21:58.039 --> 00:21:59.669 align:start position:0%
they would use that list to start
prioritizing

00:21:59.669 --> 00:21:59.679 align:start position:0%
prioritizing
 
00:22:01.669 --> 00:22:01.679 align:start position:0%
which clinical procedures they would
 
00:22:03.669 --> 00:22:03.679 align:start position:0%
continue to pay for
 
00:22:05.750 --> 00:22:05.760 align:start position:0%
and which ones would have to be
 
00:22:07.110 --> 00:22:07.120 align:start position:0%
weighed out
 
00:22:09.270 --> 00:22:09.280 align:start position:0%
until there was more money available in
 
00:22:10.390 --> 00:22:10.400 align:start position:0%
the state
 
00:22:13.110 --> 00:22:13.120 align:start position:0%
and although i don't like that system
 
00:22:15.669 --> 00:22:15.679 align:start position:0%
i can see the potential for needing to
 
00:22:18.549 --> 00:22:18.559 align:start position:0%
have a system such as that
 
00:22:22.310 --> 00:22:22.320 align:start position:0%
and so so what i would like to know is
 
00:22:25.590 --> 00:22:25.600 align:start position:0%
if we if we leave this language in here
 
00:22:28.710 --> 00:22:28.720 align:start position:0%
does this leave us with the authority to
 
00:22:28.720 --> 00:22:30.470 align:start position:0%
does this leave us with the authority to
create

00:22:30.470 --> 00:22:30.480 align:start position:0%
create
 
00:22:30.480 --> 00:22:32.070 align:start position:0%
create
effectively

00:22:32.070 --> 00:22:32.080 align:start position:0%
effectively
 
00:22:34.710 --> 00:22:34.720 align:start position:0%
a waiting list if if we if we needed to
 
00:22:37.350 --> 00:22:37.360 align:start position:0%
do that in a worse case
 
00:22:37.360 --> 00:22:38.390 align:start position:0%
do that in a worse case
so

00:22:38.390 --> 00:22:38.400 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:22:41.750 --> 00:22:41.760 align:start position:0%
representative weiler your hand is up
 
00:22:43.510 --> 00:22:43.520 align:start position:0%
yes thank you mr chair
 
00:22:45.990 --> 00:22:46.000 align:start position:0%
uh you run into the complication of you
 
00:22:48.230 --> 00:22:48.240 align:start position:0%
put money aside in this fund
 
00:22:51.110 --> 00:22:51.120 align:start position:0%
and now you ran short of it in that fund
 
00:22:53.270 --> 00:22:53.280 align:start position:0%
and you have to transfer money from one
 
00:22:55.669 --> 00:22:55.679 align:start position:0%
fund to another you got to go to fiscal
 
00:22:57.909 --> 00:22:57.919 align:start position:0%
some delays um
 
00:22:57.919 --> 00:22:58.710 align:start position:0%
some delays um
and

00:22:58.710 --> 00:22:58.720 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:23:00.549 --> 00:23:00.559 align:start position:0%
you know and then people that are
 
00:23:01.990 --> 00:23:02.000 align:start position:0%
looking at the money and the fund you
 
00:23:03.669 --> 00:23:03.679 align:start position:0%
took it from why you're taking it out of
 
00:23:05.430 --> 00:23:05.440 align:start position:0%
our fund you know
 
00:23:07.270 --> 00:23:07.280 align:start position:0%
it's not as easy as it looks because
 
00:23:10.070 --> 00:23:10.080 align:start position:0%
it's all in separate funds plus the
 
00:23:12.230 --> 00:23:12.240 align:start position:0%
percentages in each fund
 
00:23:14.230 --> 00:23:14.240 align:start position:0%
between federal and
 
00:23:15.669 --> 00:23:15.679 align:start position:0%
agency and
 
00:23:16.950 --> 00:23:16.960 align:start position:0%
general funds
 
00:23:19.909 --> 00:23:19.919 align:start position:0%
could be different in each case so
 
00:23:19.919 --> 00:23:20.710 align:start position:0%
could be different in each case so
it's

00:23:20.710 --> 00:23:20.720 align:start position:0%
it's
 
00:23:23.110 --> 00:23:23.120 align:start position:0%
not as simple as it looks
 
00:23:24.870 --> 00:23:24.880 align:start position:0%
to adopt that system
 
00:23:25.990 --> 00:23:26.000 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:23:27.669 --> 00:23:27.679 align:start position:0%
thank you sir uh
 
00:23:29.909 --> 00:23:29.919 align:start position:0%
so if representative or representative
 
00:23:31.909 --> 00:23:31.919 align:start position:0%
if ms fox is
 
00:23:35.350 --> 00:23:35.360 align:start position:0%
ready to speak to us i'd love to hear
 
00:23:38.630 --> 00:23:38.640 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and members of the
 
00:23:40.950 --> 00:23:40.960 align:start position:0%
committee for the record i'm katya foxx
 
00:23:42.390 --> 00:23:42.400 align:start position:0%
i'm the director of the division for
 
00:23:45.590 --> 00:23:45.600 align:start position:0%
behavioral health for the department and
 
00:23:48.310 --> 00:23:48.320 align:start position:0%
what um this language is so confusing
 
00:23:50.310 --> 00:23:50.320 align:start position:0%
and every single time it comes up we
 
00:23:53.190 --> 00:23:53.200 align:start position:0%
have to go back and do the history on it
 
00:23:55.190 --> 00:23:55.200 align:start position:0%
um if you think about the time period
 
00:23:57.990 --> 00:23:58.000 align:start position:0%
when it was put in it was when we were
 
00:24:01.110 --> 00:24:01.120 align:start position:0%
struggling with our budget and had uh
 
00:24:04.870 --> 00:24:04.880 align:start position:0%
revenue issues as well so this was put
 
00:24:06.710 --> 00:24:06.720 align:start position:0%
in to protect the community mental
 
00:24:09.190 --> 00:24:09.200 align:start position:0%
health centers essentially so that they
 
00:24:11.190 --> 00:24:11.200 align:start position:0%
were not stuck on
 
00:24:12.710 --> 00:24:12.720 align:start position:0%
having to
 
00:24:15.590 --> 00:24:15.600 align:start position:0%
provide services when the state was not
 
00:24:18.390 --> 00:24:18.400 align:start position:0%
providing enough funding and so this
 
00:24:19.990 --> 00:24:20.000 align:start position:0%
allowed them to
 
00:24:23.190 --> 00:24:23.200 align:start position:0%
create the so-called waitlists
 
00:24:24.950 --> 00:24:24.960 align:start position:0%
for services
 
00:24:26.789 --> 00:24:26.799 align:start position:0%
and as
 
00:24:28.310 --> 00:24:28.320 align:start position:0%
karen round said
 
00:24:30.710 --> 00:24:30.720 align:start position:0%
this has never had to happen but it was
 
00:24:33.110 --> 00:24:33.120 align:start position:0%
a safety net so it's really a safety net
 
00:24:34.710 --> 00:24:34.720 align:start position:0%
for the centers
 
00:24:37.990 --> 00:24:38.000 align:start position:0%
because of the continuous
 
00:24:39.990 --> 00:24:40.000 align:start position:0%
inclusion of this in
 
00:24:41.510 --> 00:24:41.520 align:start position:0%
the trailer bill
 
00:24:44.549 --> 00:24:44.559 align:start position:0%
we're fine with it going away and we're
 
00:24:46.630 --> 00:24:46.640 align:start position:0%
also fine with it staying
 
00:24:49.510 --> 00:24:49.520 align:start position:0%
but that really is is the point of it is
 
00:24:51.190 --> 00:24:51.200 align:start position:0%
to protect the community mental health
 
00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:52.149 align:start position:0%
to protect the community mental health
centers

00:24:52.149 --> 00:24:52.159 align:start position:0%
centers
 
00:24:55.029 --> 00:24:55.039 align:start position:0%
um so they don't have to continue
 
00:24:57.430 --> 00:24:57.440 align:start position:0%
services when they don't have the means
 
00:25:00.390 --> 00:25:00.400 align:start position:0%
to um to pay for their staff and and for
 
00:25:02.950 --> 00:25:02.960 align:start position:0%
the services
 
00:25:02.960 --> 00:25:04.789 align:start position:0%
the services
right

00:25:04.789 --> 00:25:04.799 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:25:04.799 --> 00:25:06.630 align:start position:0%
right
so

00:25:06.630 --> 00:25:06.640 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:25:09.430 --> 00:25:09.440 align:start position:0%
so if if we ever got into a worst-case
 
00:25:12.710 --> 00:25:12.720 align:start position:0%
scenario and the state didn't have money
 
00:25:14.630 --> 00:25:14.640 align:start position:0%
wouldn't it be reasonable to say that
 
00:25:17.590 --> 00:25:17.600 align:start position:0%
the providers shouldn't be forced to
 
00:25:19.350 --> 00:25:19.360 align:start position:0%
provide services if they're not going to
 
00:25:22.549 --> 00:25:22.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:24.149 --> 00:25:24.159 align:start position:0%
ms fox
 
00:25:29.590 --> 00:25:29.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:31.350 --> 00:25:31.360 align:start position:0%
thank you uh for
 
00:25:35.350 --> 00:25:35.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:36.789 --> 00:25:36.799 align:start position:0%
so are
 
00:25:38.710 --> 00:25:38.720 align:start position:0%
are there any other
 
00:25:41.110 --> 00:25:41.120 align:start position:0%
comments from the committee
 
00:25:43.669 --> 00:25:43.679 align:start position:0%
i is there a hand up in the audience
 
00:25:46.390 --> 00:25:46.400 align:start position:0%
there uh mr ripple there is could i
 
00:25:48.230 --> 00:25:48.240 align:start position:0%
actually make one comment if you don't
 
00:25:48.240 --> 00:25:49.110 align:start position:0%
actually make one comment if you don't
sure

00:25:49.110 --> 00:25:49.120 align:start position:0%
sure
 
00:25:51.590 --> 00:25:51.600 align:start position:0%
um i think he would want to get a good
 
00:25:53.909 --> 00:25:53.919 align:start position:0%
look at the department's language before
 
00:25:55.590 --> 00:25:55.600 align:start position:0%
deciding what it would do because as i
 
00:25:55.600 --> 00:25:56.470 align:start position:0%
deciding what it would do because as i
understand

00:25:56.470 --> 00:25:56.480 align:start position:0%
understand
 
00:25:58.950 --> 00:25:58.960 align:start position:0%
i think if it repeals the repeal
 
00:26:00.470 --> 00:26:00.480 align:start position:0%
that would have the effect of leaving
 
00:26:03.029 --> 00:26:03.039 align:start position:0%
the existing language in place and the
 
00:26:05.190 --> 00:26:05.200 align:start position:0%
existing language
 
00:26:06.789 --> 00:26:06.799 align:start position:0%
continues to make
 
00:26:08.470 --> 00:26:08.480 align:start position:0%
mental health services subject to
 
00:26:10.549 --> 00:26:10.559 align:start position:0%
available appropriations so if you're
 
00:26:12.549 --> 00:26:12.559 align:start position:0%
repealing the repeal
 
00:26:14.470 --> 00:26:14.480 align:start position:0%
you would be making that limitation
 
00:26:14.480 --> 00:26:15.990 align:start position:0%
you would be making that limitation
permanent

00:26:15.990 --> 00:26:16.000 align:start position:0%
permanent
 
00:26:17.669 --> 00:26:17.679 align:start position:0%
rather than extending it for another two
 
00:26:17.679 --> 00:26:20.549 align:start position:0%
rather than extending it for another two
years

00:26:20.549 --> 00:26:20.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:22.390 --> 00:26:22.400 align:start position:0%
that's confusing i'm sorry
 
00:26:23.590 --> 00:26:23.600 align:start position:0%
no no
 
00:26:23.600 --> 00:26:24.549 align:start position:0%
no no
you

00:26:24.549 --> 00:26:24.559 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:26:27.350 --> 00:26:27.360 align:start position:0%
you just ran into headspace limitations
 
00:26:30.390 --> 00:26:30.400 align:start position:0%
on my part is all uh that's
 
00:26:30.400 --> 00:26:31.190 align:start position:0%
on my part is all uh that's
um

00:26:31.190 --> 00:26:31.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:26:34.549 --> 00:26:34.559 align:start position:0%
okay so so so the bottom line
 
00:26:34.559 --> 00:26:36.630 align:start position:0%
okay so so so the bottom line
is

00:26:36.630 --> 00:26:36.640 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:26:40.149 --> 00:26:40.159 align:start position:0%
i don't want to leave the possibility
 
00:26:42.950 --> 00:26:42.960 align:start position:0%
that if the state runs out of money
 
00:26:45.510 --> 00:26:45.520 align:start position:0%
that we would be compelling providers to
 
00:26:49.909 --> 00:26:49.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:52.230 --> 00:26:52.240 align:start position:0%
so if that was the position we wanted to
 
00:26:54.230 --> 00:26:54.240 align:start position:0%
end up with
 
00:26:57.029 --> 00:26:57.039 align:start position:0%
do we accept this language as it is and
 
00:26:59.669 --> 00:26:59.679 align:start position:0%
kick the can down to 2023
 
00:27:01.830 --> 00:27:01.840 align:start position:0%
or do we go with the williams language
 
00:27:03.990 --> 00:27:04.000 align:start position:0%
to repeal the repeal
 
00:27:06.870 --> 00:27:06.880 align:start position:0%
i mean they can't both do the same thing
 
00:27:09.029 --> 00:27:09.039 align:start position:0%
i believe they they both do the same
 
00:27:10.549 --> 00:27:10.559 align:start position:0%
thing this this
 
00:27:12.310 --> 00:27:12.320 align:start position:0%
does it for two years and my
 
00:27:14.470 --> 00:27:14.480 align:start position:0%
understanding of the hhs language is it
 
00:27:16.630 --> 00:27:16.640 align:start position:0%
would do it permanently
 
00:27:18.549 --> 00:27:18.559 align:start position:0%
is mr williams in the audience with us
 
00:27:18.559 --> 00:27:20.950 align:start position:0%
is mr williams in the audience with us
today

00:27:20.950 --> 00:27:20.960 align:start position:0%
today
 
00:27:27.510 --> 00:27:27.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:29.590 --> 00:27:29.600 align:start position:0%
he's more than welcome
 
00:27:32.149 --> 00:27:32.159 align:start position:0%
or or if ms rounds from her notes with
 
00:27:35.110 --> 00:27:35.120 align:start position:0%
mr williams can speak to that that
 
00:27:36.230 --> 00:27:36.240 align:start position:0%
that that
 
00:27:38.310 --> 00:27:38.320 align:start position:0%
leaving the existing language and using
 
00:27:40.230 --> 00:27:40.240 align:start position:0%
the williams language
 
00:27:42.470 --> 00:27:42.480 align:start position:0%
gets us to the same place it gets us to
 
00:27:44.389 --> 00:27:44.399 align:start position:0%
the point where the state can't compel
 
00:27:47.590 --> 00:27:47.600 align:start position:0%
providers to provide services
 
00:27:49.750 --> 00:27:49.760 align:start position:0%
that is my understanding and i i believe
 
00:27:52.789 --> 00:27:52.799 align:start position:0%
that um i i just sent kevin the email
 
00:27:54.789 --> 00:27:54.799 align:start position:0%
with the language from mr williams and i
 
00:27:56.310 --> 00:27:56.320 align:start position:0%
think he had
 
00:27:59.669 --> 00:27:59.679 align:start position:0%
ols maybe look at it or as well so i
 
00:28:01.350 --> 00:28:01.360 align:start position:0%
know it would go through them again but
 
00:28:04.310 --> 00:28:04.320 align:start position:0%
um i do believe that that's what it does
 
00:28:08.549 --> 00:28:08.559 align:start position:0%
so i think based on that we know um
 
00:28:11.029 --> 00:28:11.039 align:start position:0%
we know enough and i see mr scabie with
 
00:28:12.950 --> 00:28:12.960 align:start position:0%
his hands up but i think what what we
 
00:28:12.960 --> 00:28:13.990 align:start position:0%
his hands up but i think what what we
know

00:28:13.990 --> 00:28:14.000 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:28:15.510 --> 00:28:15.520 align:start position:0%
is that
 
00:28:17.830 --> 00:28:17.840 align:start position:0%
we can't vote on this today we we need
 
00:28:18.950 --> 00:28:18.960 align:start position:0%
to share
 
00:28:20.789 --> 00:28:20.799 align:start position:0%
mr williams language with the committee
 
00:28:22.710 --> 00:28:22.720 align:start position:0%
members and have everyone think about
 
00:28:24.470 --> 00:28:24.480 align:start position:0%
which way they want to go
 
00:28:27.029 --> 00:28:27.039 align:start position:0%
if we end up in the same spot
 
00:28:28.389 --> 00:28:28.399 align:start position:0%
by either
 
00:28:30.789 --> 00:28:30.799 align:start position:0%
sticking with hb2 as is
 
00:28:33.510 --> 00:28:33.520 align:start position:0%
or by using mr williams language i would
 
00:28:35.269 --> 00:28:35.279 align:start position:0%
prefer the solution
 
00:28:37.990 --> 00:28:38.000 align:start position:0%
that is more long term so that we get
 
00:28:40.710 --> 00:28:40.720 align:start position:0%
out of this kick in the can mode but but
 
00:28:43.110 --> 00:28:43.120 align:start position:0%
we need to all individually look at this
 
00:28:44.470 --> 00:28:44.480 align:start position:0%
and think about it
 
00:28:46.470 --> 00:28:46.480 align:start position:0%
are there any questions about the
 
00:28:49.269 --> 00:28:49.279 align:start position:0%
committee i'd like to i'd like to close
 
00:28:49.279 --> 00:28:50.149 align:start position:0%
committee i'd like to i'd like to close
out

00:28:50.149 --> 00:28:50.159 align:start position:0%
out
 
00:28:52.230 --> 00:28:52.240 align:start position:0%
discussion on
 
00:28:56.630 --> 00:28:56.640 align:start position:0%
which one are we on we're on section 25
 
00:28:59.669 --> 00:28:59.679 align:start position:0%
pending uh a further discussion after we
 
00:29:04.389 --> 00:29:04.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:07.669 --> 00:29:07.679 align:start position:0%
i'm not i'm not seeing any objections
 
00:29:07.679 --> 00:29:09.430 align:start position:0%
i'm not i'm not seeing any objections
um

00:29:09.430 --> 00:29:09.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:29:11.830 --> 00:29:11.840 align:start position:0%
mr skibby took your hand down i was just
 
00:29:14.710 --> 00:29:14.720 align:start position:0%
about to call you if you if you think
 
00:29:16.710 --> 00:29:16.720 align:start position:0%
you have something um
 
00:29:19.190 --> 00:29:19.200 align:start position:0%
relevant to to the particular decision
 
00:29:21.750 --> 00:29:21.760 align:start position:0%
we're trying to make right now uh we we
 
00:29:25.269 --> 00:29:25.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:27.669 --> 00:29:27.679 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um mike skibby from
 
00:29:31.029 --> 00:29:31.039 align:start position:0%
the disability rights center um
 
00:29:31.909 --> 00:29:31.919 align:start position:0%
i think
 
00:29:34.710 --> 00:29:34.720 align:start position:0%
it's important to recognize that the the
 
00:29:40.389 --> 00:29:40.399 align:start position:0%
law before the fiscal crisis of 2011
 
00:29:40.399 --> 00:29:42.310 align:start position:0%
law before the fiscal crisis of 2011
was

00:29:42.310 --> 00:29:42.320 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:29:43.590 --> 00:29:43.600 align:start position:0%
and i'll read it to you because it's
 
00:29:45.590 --> 00:29:45.600 align:start position:0%
right in the statute books
 
00:29:48.789 --> 00:29:48.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:50.470 --> 00:29:50.480 align:start position:0%
admission to the
 
00:29:52.389 --> 00:29:52.399 align:start position:0%
mental health services
 
00:29:53.669 --> 00:29:53.679 align:start position:0%
system the state's mental health
 
00:29:55.590 --> 00:29:55.600 align:start position:0%
services system which includes the
 
00:29:57.110 --> 00:29:57.120 align:start position:0%
mental health centers but it also
 
00:29:59.990 --> 00:30:00.000 align:start position:0%
includes other components of the state's
 
00:30:02.070 --> 00:30:02.080 align:start position:0%
mental health system
 
00:30:04.149 --> 00:30:04.159 align:start position:0%
shall not be denied
 
00:30:06.830 --> 00:30:06.840 align:start position:0%
um based on inability to pay so
 
00:30:10.070 --> 00:30:10.080 align:start position:0%
basically before 2011 there was a
 
00:30:13.909 --> 00:30:13.919 align:start position:0%
commitment by the state to care for
 
00:30:17.269 --> 00:30:17.279 align:start position:0%
poor people who are mentally ill
 
00:30:19.909 --> 00:30:19.919 align:start position:0%
and in 2011 the mental health center
 
00:30:19.919 --> 00:30:20.789 align:start position:0%
and in 2011 the mental health center
said

00:30:20.789 --> 00:30:20.799 align:start position:0%
said
 
00:30:23.269 --> 00:30:23.279 align:start position:0%
we are concerned about that continuing
 
00:30:25.990 --> 00:30:26.000 align:start position:0%
in statute under the current
 
00:30:28.549 --> 00:30:28.559 align:start position:0%
crisis circumstances so we would like to
 
00:30:30.870 --> 00:30:30.880 align:start position:0%
have the authority to create a wait list
 
00:30:32.630 --> 00:30:32.640 align:start position:0%
for mental health services it's not a
 
00:30:32.640 --> 00:30:33.669 align:start position:0%
for mental health services it's not a
broad

00:30:33.669 --> 00:30:33.679 align:start position:0%
broad
 
00:30:35.909 --> 00:30:35.919 align:start position:0%
medicaid provision it's completely
 
00:30:37.830 --> 00:30:37.840 align:start position:0%
focused on poor people with mental
 
00:30:39.830 --> 00:30:39.840 align:start position:0%
health problems
 
00:30:41.350 --> 00:30:41.360 align:start position:0%
and so
 
00:30:43.110 --> 00:30:43.120 align:start position:0%
a temporary
 
00:30:44.950 --> 00:30:44.960 align:start position:0%
change to the statute was adopted by the
 
00:30:47.510 --> 00:30:47.520 align:start position:0%
legislature and it was to expire in two
 
00:30:47.520 --> 00:30:49.110 align:start position:0%
legislature and it was to expire in two
years

00:30:49.110 --> 00:30:49.120 align:start position:0%
years
 
00:30:52.310 --> 00:30:52.320 align:start position:0%
so that has been repeatedly
 
00:30:54.310 --> 00:30:54.320 align:start position:0%
you know the can has been repeatedly
 
00:30:56.470 --> 00:30:56.480 align:start position:0%
been kicked down the road by saying okay
 
00:30:57.990 --> 00:30:58.000 align:start position:0%
it's not gonna expire this time it'll
 
00:30:59.909 --> 00:30:59.919 align:start position:0%
expire two years from now and that's
 
00:31:02.549 --> 00:31:02.559 align:start position:0%
happened um several times and here we
 
00:31:04.710 --> 00:31:04.720 align:start position:0%
are again with kicking the can down the
 
00:31:04.720 --> 00:31:05.830 align:start position:0%
are again with kicking the can down the
road

00:31:05.830 --> 00:31:05.840 align:start position:0%
road
 
00:31:05.840 --> 00:31:07.509 align:start position:0%
road
um

00:31:07.509 --> 00:31:07.519 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:31:07.519 --> 00:31:08.389 align:start position:0%
um
so

00:31:08.389 --> 00:31:08.399 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:31:10.710 --> 00:31:10.720 align:start position:0%
i guess the question is
 
00:31:12.230 --> 00:31:12.240 align:start position:0%
is there some reason that we should
 
00:31:14.230 --> 00:31:14.240 align:start position:0%
continue to operate as though we are
 
00:31:16.830 --> 00:31:16.840 align:start position:0%
under a fiscal crisis like we were in
 
00:31:19.110 --> 00:31:19.120 align:start position:0%
2011. it seems to me that there is a
 
00:31:20.630 --> 00:31:20.640 align:start position:0%
theoretical possibility that we're going
 
00:31:22.070 --> 00:31:22.080 align:start position:0%
to run out of money for mental health
 
00:31:24.470 --> 00:31:24.480 align:start position:0%
services but i really doubt that
 
00:31:27.110 --> 00:31:27.120 align:start position:0%
you're going to run out of money for
 
00:31:29.350 --> 00:31:29.360 align:start position:0%
for admitting people to the new
 
00:31:31.029 --> 00:31:31.039 align:start position:0%
hampshire hospital who are poor for
 
00:31:31.039 --> 00:31:32.549 align:start position:0%
hampshire hospital who are poor for
example

00:31:32.549 --> 00:31:32.559 align:start position:0%
example
 
00:31:34.789 --> 00:31:34.799 align:start position:0%
and it seems to me that
 
00:31:36.789 --> 00:31:36.799 align:start position:0%
it makes sense to remove this provision
 
00:31:38.230 --> 00:31:38.240 align:start position:0%
completely and return to the
 
00:31:38.240 --> 00:31:39.669 align:start position:0%
completely and return to the
pre-existing

00:31:39.669 --> 00:31:39.679 align:start position:0%
pre-existing
 
00:31:42.549 --> 00:31:42.559 align:start position:0%
i would say you know morally sound
 
00:31:45.509 --> 00:31:45.519 align:start position:0%
commitment by the state to care for the
 
00:31:47.269 --> 00:31:47.279 align:start position:0%
for poor people who are extremely
 
00:31:48.630 --> 00:31:48.640 align:start position:0%
mentally ill
 
00:31:48.640 --> 00:31:50.549 align:start position:0%
mentally ill
um

00:31:50.549 --> 00:31:50.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:31:52.789 --> 00:31:52.799 align:start position:0%
i would like to get a distinction here
 
00:31:52.799 --> 00:31:53.590 align:start position:0%
i would like to get a distinction here
though

00:31:53.590 --> 00:31:53.600 align:start position:0%
though
 
00:31:56.789 --> 00:31:56.799 align:start position:0%
it is as it was described prior to your
 
00:31:56.799 --> 00:31:58.149 align:start position:0%
it is as it was described prior to your
testimony

00:31:58.149 --> 00:31:58.159 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
00:32:00.389 --> 00:32:00.399 align:start position:0%
this was about whether or not the state
 
00:32:02.470 --> 00:32:02.480 align:start position:0%
had money to pay
 
00:32:03.990 --> 00:32:04.000 align:start position:0%
the provider
 
00:32:06.710 --> 00:32:06.720 align:start position:0%
i i don't i don't i i think pretty much
 
00:32:08.870 --> 00:32:08.880 align:start position:0%
everyone has accepted
 
00:32:08.880 --> 00:32:10.549 align:start position:0%
everyone has accepted
that

00:32:10.549 --> 00:32:10.559 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:32:12.789 --> 00:32:12.799 align:start position:0%
our health the american health system
 
00:32:15.830 --> 00:32:15.840 align:start position:0%
accepts every poor patient
 
00:32:19.350 --> 00:32:19.360 align:start position:0%
regardless of their ability to pay
 
00:32:22.389 --> 00:32:22.399 align:start position:0%
but but this this is this reads a little
 
00:32:24.789 --> 00:32:24.799 align:start position:0%
different to me if it's really that the
 
00:32:27.590 --> 00:32:27.600 align:start position:0%
state is no longer in a position to
 
00:32:30.870 --> 00:32:30.880 align:start position:0%
reimburse the provider
 
00:32:31.830 --> 00:32:31.840 align:start position:0%
and so
 
00:32:34.950 --> 00:32:34.960 align:start position:0%
uh so i i see that um
 
00:32:37.350 --> 00:32:37.360 align:start position:0%
mr ripple has highlighted what he
 
00:32:40.070 --> 00:32:40.080 align:start position:0%
believes to be the critical part of the
 
00:32:43.029 --> 00:32:43.039 align:start position:0%
the law um but would you just address
 
00:32:44.070 --> 00:32:44.080 align:start position:0%
that or
 
00:32:45.990 --> 00:32:46.000 align:start position:0%
are we talking about
 
00:32:47.909 --> 00:32:47.919 align:start position:0%
which of these two things are we talking
 
00:32:50.630 --> 00:32:50.640 align:start position:0%
about the state's inability to pay or
 
00:32:54.870 --> 00:32:54.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:57.029 --> 00:32:57.039 align:start position:0%
well the language refers to the state
 
00:32:59.269 --> 00:32:59.279 align:start position:0%
mental health services system
 
00:33:00.950 --> 00:33:00.960 align:start position:0%
which is composed of the community
 
00:33:02.870 --> 00:33:02.880 align:start position:0%
services that are administered by the
 
00:33:04.549 --> 00:33:04.559 align:start position:0%
state and the institutional services
 
00:33:06.870 --> 00:33:06.880 align:start position:0%
that are administered by the state so
 
00:33:09.269 --> 00:33:09.279 align:start position:0%
the community services are largely but
 
00:33:10.549 --> 00:33:10.559 align:start position:0%
not solely
 
00:33:11.990 --> 00:33:12.000 align:start position:0%
administered by the community mental
 
00:33:13.669 --> 00:33:13.679 align:start position:0%
health system the community mental
 
00:33:15.190 --> 00:33:15.200 align:start position:0%
health centers
 
00:33:17.750 --> 00:33:17.760 align:start position:0%
so the language is not
 
00:33:21.509 --> 00:33:21.519 align:start position:0%
is is not only focused on
 
00:33:23.590 --> 00:33:23.600 align:start position:0%
community services but i agree it's
 
00:33:25.909 --> 00:33:25.919 align:start position:0%
largely because of their concerns that
 
00:33:27.830 --> 00:33:27.840 align:start position:0%
it was adopted so the highlighted
 
00:33:29.509 --> 00:33:29.519 align:start position:0%
language is the current law which
 
00:33:32.389 --> 00:33:32.399 align:start position:0%
expires in july of this year
 
00:33:35.750 --> 00:33:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:38.310 --> 00:33:38.320 align:start position:0%
but what was the prior law and what will
 
00:33:39.750 --> 00:33:39.760 align:start position:0%
become law
 
00:33:41.350 --> 00:33:41.360 align:start position:0%
on july 1
 
00:33:43.590 --> 00:33:43.600 align:start position:0%
is that eligibility shall not be denied
 
00:33:45.509 --> 00:33:45.519 align:start position:0%
based on a number of things including
 
00:33:47.430 --> 00:33:47.440 align:start position:0%
inability to pay
 
00:33:49.350 --> 00:33:49.360 align:start position:0%
period paragraph not paragraph but not
 
00:33:51.269 --> 00:33:51.279 align:start position:0%
the but without
 
00:33:53.430 --> 00:33:53.440 align:start position:0%
the additional authority to create a
 
00:33:54.789 --> 00:33:54.799 align:start position:0%
wait list
 
00:33:54.799 --> 00:33:55.830 align:start position:0%
wait list
so

00:33:55.830 --> 00:33:55.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:33:57.430 --> 00:33:57.440 align:start position:0%
it's the question that you ought to be
 
00:33:59.350 --> 00:33:59.360 align:start position:0%
asking yourself is is there some reason
 
00:34:02.070 --> 00:34:02.080 align:start position:0%
that we should walk away permanently
 
00:34:05.029 --> 00:34:05.039 align:start position:0%
from that commitment to poor people
 
00:34:07.190 --> 00:34:07.200 align:start position:0%
or should we continue to make it a
 
00:34:09.589 --> 00:34:09.599 align:start position:0%
temporary walking away from that you
 
00:34:11.829 --> 00:34:11.839 align:start position:0%
know unqualified commitment or should we
 
00:34:13.430 --> 00:34:13.440 align:start position:0%
or should we
 
00:34:15.990 --> 00:34:16.000 align:start position:0%
you know just put put it off
 
00:34:18.069 --> 00:34:18.079 align:start position:0%
for another two years so
 
00:34:20.869 --> 00:34:20.879 align:start position:0%
um i think that i i don't think that
 
00:34:22.950 --> 00:34:22.960 align:start position:0%
there's any reason to think that we are
 
00:34:25.030 --> 00:34:25.040 align:start position:0%
still in the emergency situation we were
 
00:34:25.950 --> 00:34:25.960 align:start position:0%
in in
 
00:34:28.550 --> 00:34:28.560 align:start position:0%
2011 and that there ought to be some
 
00:34:31.030 --> 00:34:31.040 align:start position:0%
presumption that we returned to the
 
00:34:33.190 --> 00:34:33.200 align:start position:0%
commitment that was made you know many
 
00:34:34.550 --> 00:34:34.560 align:start position:0%
years ago
 
00:34:34.560 --> 00:34:36.550 align:start position:0%
years ago
um

00:34:36.550 --> 00:34:36.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:34:39.270 --> 00:34:39.280 align:start position:0%
and there's really no reason um you know
 
00:34:41.109 --> 00:34:41.119 align:start position:0%
to think that that commitment is not
 
00:34:42.629 --> 00:34:42.639 align:start position:0%
something that that we can follow
 
00:34:43.669 --> 00:34:43.679 align:start position:0%
through on
 
00:34:46.389 --> 00:34:46.399 align:start position:0%
yeah okay so i do appreciate your
 
00:34:49.349 --> 00:34:49.359 align:start position:0%
testimony and and i think you've uh
 
00:34:52.310 --> 00:34:52.320 align:start position:0%
helped ratify the decision to postpone a
 
00:34:54.389 --> 00:34:54.399 align:start position:0%
further discussion and a vote on this
 
00:34:56.629 --> 00:34:56.639 align:start position:0%
because we need to see mr williams
 
00:34:56.639 --> 00:34:57.589 align:start position:0%
because we need to see mr williams
language

00:34:57.589 --> 00:34:57.599 align:start position:0%
language
 
00:35:01.510 --> 00:35:01.520 align:start position:0%
and um i you know i i need to get into
 
00:35:01.520 --> 00:35:02.790 align:start position:0%
and um i you know i i need to get into
this

00:35:02.790 --> 00:35:02.800 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:35:04.710 --> 00:35:04.720 align:start position:0%
this paragraph that mr ripple is
 
00:35:06.550 --> 00:35:06.560 align:start position:0%
highlighting for us
 
00:35:06.560 --> 00:35:08.710 align:start position:0%
highlighting for us
um

00:35:08.710 --> 00:35:08.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:35:11.990 --> 00:35:12.000 align:start position:0%
and i just i just would say that i i
 
00:35:13.990 --> 00:35:14.000 align:start position:0%
as i'm reading this i'm going to try to
 
00:35:16.630 --> 00:35:16.640 align:start position:0%
be making the distinction between
 
00:35:19.030 --> 00:35:19.040 align:start position:0%
providing emergency services to the
 
00:35:19.040 --> 00:35:20.069 align:start position:0%
providing emergency services to the
indigent

00:35:20.069 --> 00:35:20.079 align:start position:0%
indigent
 
00:35:21.750 --> 00:35:21.760 align:start position:0%
which is which has
 
00:35:23.750 --> 00:35:23.760 align:start position:0%
become an american value of our health
 
00:35:23.760 --> 00:35:25.030 align:start position:0%
become an american value of our health
system

00:35:25.030 --> 00:35:25.040 align:start position:0%
system
 
00:35:25.040 --> 00:35:25.990 align:start position:0%
system
and

00:35:25.990 --> 00:35:26.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:35:29.270 --> 00:35:29.280 align:start position:0%
whether or not the state can compel
 
00:35:32.150 --> 00:35:32.160 align:start position:0%
private individuals to provide services
 
00:35:34.470 --> 00:35:34.480 align:start position:0%
that the state knows it's unable to pay
 
00:35:34.480 --> 00:35:35.589 align:start position:0%
that the state knows it's unable to pay
for

00:35:35.589 --> 00:35:35.599 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:35:38.550 --> 00:35:38.560 align:start position:0%
that second category
 
00:35:40.950 --> 00:35:40.960 align:start position:0%
gets into a bit of an enslavement issue
 
00:35:42.310 --> 00:35:42.320 align:start position:0%
if you compel people without
 
00:35:44.630 --> 00:35:44.640 align:start position:0%
reimbursement to do work so
 
00:35:47.109 --> 00:35:47.119 align:start position:0%
so i i do think these are different
 
00:35:49.190 --> 00:35:49.200 align:start position:0%
issues and there's a philosophical
 
00:35:50.630 --> 00:35:50.640 align:start position:0%
nuance in there
 
00:35:53.030 --> 00:35:53.040 align:start position:0%
and i don't know which side of that uh
 
00:35:55.030 --> 00:35:55.040 align:start position:0%
divide we're on until i
 
00:35:58.550 --> 00:35:58.560 align:start position:0%
i i re-read all this so
 
00:35:58.560 --> 00:35:59.510 align:start position:0%
i i re-read all this so
um

00:35:59.510 --> 00:35:59.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:36:01.190 --> 00:36:01.200 align:start position:0%
well i think i do think
 
00:36:03.510 --> 00:36:03.520 align:start position:0%
i do think that you can
 
00:36:06.710 --> 00:36:06.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:08.710 --> 00:36:08.720 align:start position:0%
i don't i don't i don't want to debate
 
00:36:11.109 --> 00:36:11.119 align:start position:0%
if you if you if you have some more
 
00:36:14.150 --> 00:36:14.160 align:start position:0%
uh written input for us as we as we
 
00:36:16.150 --> 00:36:16.160 align:start position:0%
review this overnight
 
00:36:16.160 --> 00:36:16.950 align:start position:0%
review this overnight
uh

00:36:16.950 --> 00:36:16.960 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:36:18.870 --> 00:36:18.880 align:start position:0%
it'd be great we'd i'd be happy to have
 
00:36:20.710 --> 00:36:20.720 align:start position:0%
us review it but but i would like to
 
00:36:22.390 --> 00:36:22.400 align:start position:0%
continue because we have we do have a
 
00:36:26.230 --> 00:36:26.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:27.910 --> 00:36:27.920 align:start position:0%
um thank you
 
00:36:29.190 --> 00:36:29.200 align:start position:0%
thank you sir
 
00:36:30.950 --> 00:36:30.960 align:start position:0%
uh unless you have something that you
 
00:36:32.550 --> 00:36:32.560 align:start position:0%
think is really relevant right now i
 
00:36:33.990 --> 00:36:34.000 align:start position:0%
don't want to i don't want to shut you
 
00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:36.470 align:start position:0%
don't want to i don't want to shut you
down

00:36:36.470 --> 00:36:36.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:38.630 --> 00:36:38.640 align:start position:0%
oh my i think i removed his ability to
 
00:36:49.589 --> 00:36:49.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:51.349 --> 00:36:51.359 align:start position:0%
all i was going to say is that i think
 
00:36:52.950 --> 00:36:52.960 align:start position:0%
you can
 
00:36:55.190 --> 00:36:55.200 align:start position:0%
you can modify the statute so that you
 
00:36:57.190 --> 00:36:57.200 align:start position:0%
relieve community mental health programs
 
00:36:58.790 --> 00:36:58.800 align:start position:0%
of being
 
00:37:00.710 --> 00:37:00.720 align:start position:0%
um required to provide services without
 
00:37:03.030 --> 00:37:03.040 align:start position:0%
payment without without you know walking
 
00:37:04.470 --> 00:37:04.480 align:start position:0%
away from the commitment to poor people
 
00:37:06.230 --> 00:37:06.240 align:start position:0%
and i'll i'll send you some suggested
 
00:37:06.240 --> 00:37:07.349 align:start position:0%
and i'll i'll send you some suggested
language

00:37:07.349 --> 00:37:07.359 align:start position:0%
language
 
00:37:09.670 --> 00:37:09.680 align:start position:0%
thank you sir appreciate it
 
00:37:09.680 --> 00:37:12.310 align:start position:0%
thank you sir appreciate it
um

00:37:12.310 --> 00:37:12.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:14.950 --> 00:37:14.960 align:start position:0%
all right so uh
 
00:37:16.870 --> 00:37:16.880 align:start position:0%
i don't want to unilaterally make that
 
00:37:20.230 --> 00:37:20.240 align:start position:0%
decision but i'm i'm prepared to
 
00:37:23.589 --> 00:37:23.599 align:start position:0%
postpone further discussion on 25 until
 
00:37:26.150 --> 00:37:26.160 align:start position:0%
tomorrow or the day after if anyone
 
00:37:28.630 --> 00:37:28.640 align:start position:0%
disagrees uh you know on the committee
 
00:37:30.069 --> 00:37:30.079 align:start position:0%
let me know
 
00:37:33.030 --> 00:37:33.040 align:start position:0%
uh otherwise i think we're ready to take
 
00:37:43.750 --> 00:37:43.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:43.760 --> 00:37:47.109 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:37:47.109 --> 00:37:47.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:47.119 --> 00:37:47.990 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:37:47.990 --> 00:37:48.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:37:50.150 --> 00:37:50.160 align:start position:0%
miss rounds i'm going to invite you in
 
00:37:51.990 --> 00:37:52.000 align:start position:0%
here in just a moment but as i
 
00:37:55.510 --> 00:37:55.520 align:start position:0%
understand what section 28 does
 
00:37:57.190 --> 00:37:57.200 align:start position:0%
is it it
 
00:37:59.589 --> 00:37:59.599 align:start position:0%
it allows for
 
00:38:01.990 --> 00:38:02.000 align:start position:0%
there to be a fund
 
00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:03.430 align:start position:0%
there to be a fund
that

00:38:03.430 --> 00:38:03.440 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:38:05.270 --> 00:38:05.280 align:start position:0%
people can donate to
 
00:38:06.870 --> 00:38:06.880 align:start position:0%
and that that fund would then be
 
00:38:08.790 --> 00:38:08.800 align:start position:0%
available to help pay for emergency
 
00:38:08.800 --> 00:38:09.829 align:start position:0%
available to help pay for emergency
services

00:38:09.829 --> 00:38:09.839 align:start position:0%
services
 
00:38:13.190 --> 00:38:13.200 align:start position:0%
am i close or how far off am i no you're
 
00:38:15.109 --> 00:38:15.119 align:start position:0%
pretty close um
 
00:38:16.829 --> 00:38:16.839 align:start position:0%
your volume is really low for some
 
00:38:19.910 --> 00:38:19.920 align:start position:0%
reason that's weird let me try is that
 
00:38:20.950 --> 00:38:20.960 align:start position:0%
any better
 
00:38:23.109 --> 00:38:23.119 align:start position:0%
that's much better okay all right i will
 
00:38:25.270 --> 00:38:25.280 align:start position:0%
stay like this um kevin could you bring
 
00:38:27.670 --> 00:38:27.680 align:start position:0%
over rebecca ross just in case i forget
 
00:38:30.390 --> 00:38:30.400 align:start position:0%
to say something she can she can add um
 
00:38:33.670 --> 00:38:33.680 align:start position:0%
she's the legislative liaison for dcyf
 
00:38:33.680 --> 00:38:34.710 align:start position:0%
she's the legislative liaison for dcyf
um

00:38:34.710 --> 00:38:34.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:38:37.910 --> 00:38:37.920 align:start position:0%
so actually section 28 and section 29 go
 
00:38:40.870 --> 00:38:40.880 align:start position:0%
together um so i know you don't have 29
 
00:38:42.790 --> 00:38:42.800 align:start position:0%
slated until tomorrow but i'm just going
 
00:38:44.790 --> 00:38:44.800 align:start position:0%
to talk about them
 
00:38:46.390 --> 00:38:46.400 align:start position:0%
together because they're they're really
 
00:38:47.990 --> 00:38:48.000 align:start position:0%
for the same purpose
 
00:38:51.030 --> 00:38:51.040 align:start position:0%
28 adds the fund to
 
00:38:53.349 --> 00:38:53.359 align:start position:0%
um the revolving account part of the
 
00:38:55.510 --> 00:38:55.520 align:start position:0%
statute and establishes the revolving
 
00:38:57.910 --> 00:38:57.920 align:start position:0%
account and 29 talks about what the
 
00:39:01.349 --> 00:39:01.359 align:start position:0%
purpose of it is
 
00:39:03.270 --> 00:39:03.280 align:start position:0%
so to talk about the purpose and basic
 
00:39:03.280 --> 00:39:04.710 align:start position:0%
so to talk about the purpose and basic
terms

00:39:04.710 --> 00:39:04.720 align:start position:0%
terms
 
00:39:07.349 --> 00:39:07.359 align:start position:0%
so dcyf
 
00:39:10.310 --> 00:39:10.320 align:start position:0%
has times when there is an emergency
 
00:39:13.510 --> 00:39:13.520 align:start position:0%
type situation that they need to resolve
 
00:39:15.589 --> 00:39:15.599 align:start position:0%
something immediately so that a child
 
00:39:15.599 --> 00:39:16.390 align:start position:0%
something immediately so that a child
can

00:39:16.390 --> 00:39:16.400 align:start position:0%
can
 
00:39:19.109 --> 00:39:19.119 align:start position:0%
stay in their home with their parents or
 
00:39:21.030 --> 00:39:21.040 align:start position:0%
so that a foster family is fully
 
00:39:23.510 --> 00:39:23.520 align:start position:0%
prepared in that moment to take a child
 
00:39:25.349 --> 00:39:25.359 align:start position:0%
so it could mean
 
00:39:28.470 --> 00:39:28.480 align:start position:0%
purchasing a crib or a car seat
 
00:39:28.480 --> 00:39:29.430 align:start position:0%
purchasing a crib or a car seat
or

00:39:29.430 --> 00:39:29.440 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:39:31.829 --> 00:39:31.839 align:start position:0%
formula or something like that
 
00:39:33.510 --> 00:39:33.520 align:start position:0%
and it's literally something that needs
 
00:39:34.550 --> 00:39:34.560 align:start position:0%
to happen
 
00:39:37.190 --> 00:39:37.200 align:start position:0%
right now right so uh so this is
 
00:39:39.750 --> 00:39:39.760 align:start position:0%
something that currently happens in dcyf
 
00:39:41.270 --> 00:39:41.280 align:start position:0%
there's about
 
00:39:43.510 --> 00:39:43.520 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars a year in general funds
 
00:39:45.750 --> 00:39:45.760 align:start position:0%
budgeted in the dcyf budget
 
00:39:47.349 --> 00:39:47.359 align:start position:0%
for this purpose
 
00:39:47.359 --> 00:39:48.310 align:start position:0%
for this purpose
um

00:39:48.310 --> 00:39:48.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:39:51.430 --> 00:39:51.440 align:start position:0%
so about a year ago
 
00:39:53.349 --> 00:39:53.359 align:start position:0%
uh i would say it was about a year ago a
 
00:39:55.589 --> 00:39:55.599 align:start position:0%
year and a half ago i became more aware
 
00:39:58.710 --> 00:39:58.720 align:start position:0%
of this process and what i wanted to do
 
00:40:00.330 --> 00:40:00.340 align:start position:0%
is to make it um
 
00:40:00.340 --> 00:40:01.510 align:start position:0%
is to make it um
[Music]

00:40:01.510 --> 00:40:01.520 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:40:03.030 --> 00:40:03.040 align:start position:0%
a little bit more
 
00:40:04.550 --> 00:40:04.560 align:start position:0%
of a
 
00:40:04.560 --> 00:40:06.150 align:start position:0%
of a
uh

00:40:06.150 --> 00:40:06.160 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:40:08.309 --> 00:40:08.319 align:start position:0%
to put more controls on it that's what
 
00:40:09.670 --> 00:40:09.680 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to say to put more controls
 
00:40:12.309 --> 00:40:12.319 align:start position:0%
on it by establishing this account for
 
00:40:15.030 --> 00:40:15.040 align:start position:0%
this to happen in and for it to only
 
00:40:18.390 --> 00:40:18.400 align:start position:0%
happen in this account um and so that is
 
00:40:20.150 --> 00:40:20.160 align:start position:0%
the purpose of setting this up the other
 
00:40:21.829 --> 00:40:21.839 align:start position:0%
thing as we were working on this
 
00:40:23.750 --> 00:40:23.760 align:start position:0%
language with john williams and rebecca
 
00:40:23.760 --> 00:40:25.030 align:start position:0%
language with john williams and rebecca
ross

00:40:25.030 --> 00:40:25.040 align:start position:0%
ross
 
00:40:28.069 --> 00:40:28.079 align:start position:0%
and and director ribsum
 
00:40:29.510 --> 00:40:29.520 align:start position:0%
is one thing that i learned is that
 
00:40:32.309 --> 00:40:32.319 align:start position:0%
there are times that people call dcyf
 
00:40:34.550 --> 00:40:34.560 align:start position:0%
and want to make a donation and we could
 
00:40:36.390 --> 00:40:36.400 align:start position:0%
certainly take a donation to the
 
00:40:39.030 --> 00:40:39.040 align:start position:0%
department but it doesn't necessarily go
 
00:40:39.040 --> 00:40:39.750 align:start position:0%
department but it doesn't necessarily go
it

00:40:39.750 --> 00:40:39.760 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:40:41.270 --> 00:40:41.280 align:start position:0%
it's a little bit harder to make it for
 
00:40:43.670 --> 00:40:43.680 align:start position:0%
a specific purpose this account now
 
00:40:45.829 --> 00:40:45.839 align:start position:0%
allows us to have a very specific
 
00:40:47.190 --> 00:40:47.200 align:start position:0%
purpose that we can say if you would
 
00:40:48.390 --> 00:40:48.400 align:start position:0%
like to make a donation to the
 
00:40:51.109 --> 00:40:51.119 align:start position:0%
department we have this fund that we use
 
00:40:52.790 --> 00:40:52.800 align:start position:0%
to um
 
00:40:55.109 --> 00:40:55.119 align:start position:0%
to help families with you know emergent
 
00:40:57.910 --> 00:40:57.920 align:start position:0%
needs and that's what your donation
 
00:41:00.950 --> 00:41:00.960 align:start position:0%
would go to and so hoping therefore in
 
00:41:02.630 --> 00:41:02.640 align:start position:0%
the longer run that we start to offset
 
00:41:04.550 --> 00:41:04.560 align:start position:0%
those general funds that we're currently
 
00:41:07.990 --> 00:41:08.000 align:start position:0%
using for those emergent needs um
 
00:41:10.390 --> 00:41:10.400 align:start position:0%
rebecca is there anything i missed
 
00:41:12.230 --> 00:41:12.240 align:start position:0%
no i think that's that's an accurate
 
00:41:12.240 --> 00:41:14.390 align:start position:0%
no i think that's that's an accurate
summary

00:41:14.390 --> 00:41:14.400 align:start position:0%
summary
 
00:41:16.550 --> 00:41:16.560 align:start position:0%
so so thank you i
 
00:41:16.560 --> 00:41:18.470 align:start position:0%
so so thank you i
okay

00:41:18.470 --> 00:41:18.480 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:41:20.870 --> 00:41:20.880 align:start position:0%
so this was written by the department
 
00:41:24.790 --> 00:41:24.800 align:start position:0%
and in this language from line 8
 
00:41:28.630 --> 00:41:28.640 align:start position:0%
to line 17 in section 29
 
00:41:29.589 --> 00:41:29.599 align:start position:0%
i i
 
00:41:31.510 --> 00:41:31.520 align:start position:0%
i think what you're letting us know is
 
00:41:33.589 --> 00:41:33.599 align:start position:0%
that this has not gone to a policy
 
00:41:35.109 --> 00:41:35.119 align:start position:0%
committee anywhere
 
00:41:37.510 --> 00:41:37.520 align:start position:0%
is that true
 
00:41:39.910 --> 00:41:39.920 align:start position:0%
correct yes this is this is the
 
00:41:41.829 --> 00:41:41.839 align:start position:0%
language the language that establishes
 
00:41:43.829 --> 00:41:43.839 align:start position:0%
it it's pretty common to have revolving
 
00:41:46.309 --> 00:41:46.319 align:start position:0%
accounts established in hb2
 
00:41:48.630 --> 00:41:48.640 align:start position:0%
yeah well so that my next several
 
00:41:51.510 --> 00:41:51.520 align:start position:0%
questions shouldn't be implied to be
 
00:41:53.589 --> 00:41:53.599 align:start position:0%
against the bill or anything i i just
 
00:41:54.950 --> 00:41:54.960 align:start position:0%
want to make sure i
 
00:41:58.230 --> 00:41:58.240 align:start position:0%
i ask some process questions sure okay
 
00:42:02.390 --> 00:42:02.400 align:start position:0%
so so i i have a bias in favor of policy
 
00:42:04.150 --> 00:42:04.160 align:start position:0%
committees reviewing
 
00:42:05.510 --> 00:42:05.520 align:start position:0%
new things
 
00:42:08.950 --> 00:42:08.960 align:start position:0%
because it's i i have seen many times
 
00:42:10.790 --> 00:42:10.800 align:start position:0%
i've read something before committee
 
00:42:10.800 --> 00:42:11.990 align:start position:0%
i've read something before committee
hearings

00:42:11.990 --> 00:42:12.000 align:start position:0%
hearings
 
00:42:13.990 --> 00:42:14.000 align:start position:0%
where i thought i understood exactly
 
00:42:15.430 --> 00:42:15.440 align:start position:0%
every issue
 
00:42:17.349 --> 00:42:17.359 align:start position:0%
and somebody would come in
 
00:42:19.109 --> 00:42:19.119 align:start position:0%
to the hearing and they would point out
 
00:42:22.150 --> 00:42:22.160 align:start position:0%
a comma or they would point out a word
 
00:42:25.589 --> 00:42:25.599 align:start position:0%
and and it's something i didn't even see
 
00:42:27.829 --> 00:42:27.839 align:start position:0%
that needed to be changed or amended and
 
00:42:27.839 --> 00:42:28.870 align:start position:0%
that needed to be changed or amended and
so

00:42:28.870 --> 00:42:28.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:42:30.390 --> 00:42:30.400 align:start position:0%
so without having
 
00:42:30.400 --> 00:42:31.349 align:start position:0%
so without having
eyes

00:42:31.349 --> 00:42:31.359 align:start position:0%
eyes
 
00:42:33.990 --> 00:42:34.000 align:start position:0%
on this i'm i'm kind i'm a little
 
00:42:35.670 --> 00:42:35.680 align:start position:0%
concerned that we're
 
00:42:38.870 --> 00:42:38.880 align:start position:0%
using a potentially faulty process
 
00:42:40.950 --> 00:42:40.960 align:start position:0%
that that's just that's just commentary
 
00:42:42.550 --> 00:42:42.560 align:start position:0%
about process
 
00:42:45.750 --> 00:42:45.760 align:start position:0%
uh on line 14 for example where it says
 
00:42:47.910 --> 00:42:47.920 align:start position:0%
the funds may be comprised of public
 
00:42:47.920 --> 00:42:49.109 align:start position:0%
the funds may be comprised of public
funds

00:42:49.109 --> 00:42:49.119 align:start position:0%
funds
 
00:42:51.349 --> 00:42:51.359 align:start position:0%
gifts grants donations
 
00:42:54.230 --> 00:42:54.240 align:start position:0%
the idea of using this for gifts grants
 
00:42:56.230 --> 00:42:56.240 align:start position:0%
and donations
 
00:42:59.430 --> 00:42:59.440 align:start position:0%
seems to be in line with the intent of
 
00:43:00.790 --> 00:43:00.800 align:start position:0%
this fund
 
00:43:03.270 --> 00:43:03.280 align:start position:0%
but then when you insert the term public
 
00:43:03.280 --> 00:43:04.790 align:start position:0%
but then when you insert the term public
funds

00:43:04.790 --> 00:43:04.800 align:start position:0%
funds
 
00:43:07.510 --> 00:43:07.520 align:start position:0%
what then distinguishes this account
 
00:43:10.230 --> 00:43:10.240 align:start position:0%
from any other account that we would
 
00:43:14.230 --> 00:43:14.240 align:start position:0%
use for or put general funds into
 
00:43:17.670 --> 00:43:17.680 align:start position:0%
so the reason that i wanted to so it
 
00:43:20.309 --> 00:43:20.319 align:start position:0%
it offers more transparency it creates a
 
00:43:22.870 --> 00:43:22.880 align:start position:0%
revolving account that gets reported out
 
00:43:22.880 --> 00:43:24.230 align:start position:0%
revolving account that gets reported out
annually

00:43:24.230 --> 00:43:24.240 align:start position:0%
annually
 
00:43:26.230 --> 00:43:26.240 align:start position:0%
there's an annual report that has to be
 
00:43:28.950 --> 00:43:28.960 align:start position:0%
filed with revolving funds it also
 
00:43:32.150 --> 00:43:32.160 align:start position:0%
allows us to segregate this um as a
 
00:43:35.589 --> 00:43:35.599 align:start position:0%
separate fund uh so it really is about
 
00:43:39.030 --> 00:43:39.040 align:start position:0%
more transparency and more control over
 
00:43:41.109 --> 00:43:41.119 align:start position:0%
this part of the program
 
00:43:43.190 --> 00:43:43.200 align:start position:0%
yes ma'am i i don't believe you answered
 
00:43:45.190 --> 00:43:45.200 align:start position:0%
my question though okay
 
00:43:48.630 --> 00:43:48.640 align:start position:0%
if if we keep the term public funds on
 
00:43:50.550 --> 00:43:50.560 align:start position:0%
line 14
 
00:43:52.550 --> 00:43:52.560 align:start position:0%
doesn't this become
 
00:43:52.560 --> 00:43:53.430 align:start position:0%
doesn't this become
really

00:43:53.430 --> 00:43:53.440 align:start position:0%
really
 
00:43:53.440 --> 00:43:54.390 align:start position:0%
really
another

00:43:54.390 --> 00:43:54.400 align:start position:0%
another
 
00:43:57.190 --> 00:43:57.200 align:start position:0%
line of expense that we would we could
 
00:43:59.750 --> 00:43:59.760 align:start position:0%
put gen or line of revenue that that
 
00:44:02.309 --> 00:44:02.319 align:start position:0%
would be open to having general funds
 
00:44:04.069 --> 00:44:04.079 align:start position:0%
put into it
 
00:44:04.079 --> 00:44:05.510 align:start position:0%
put into it
yes

00:44:05.510 --> 00:44:05.520 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:44:07.750 --> 00:44:07.760 align:start position:0%
yes we are already using general funds
 
00:44:09.589 --> 00:44:09.599 align:start position:0%
for this purpose
 
00:44:11.589 --> 00:44:11.599 align:start position:0%
okay for this purpose but not for this
 
00:44:14.230 --> 00:44:14.240 align:start position:0%
fund because this fund doesn't exist
 
00:44:14.240 --> 00:44:15.190 align:start position:0%
fund because this fund doesn't exist
correct

00:44:15.190 --> 00:44:15.200 align:start position:0%
correct
 
00:44:17.510 --> 00:44:17.520 align:start position:0%
correct so we would move the general
 
00:44:19.190 --> 00:44:19.200 align:start position:0%
funds that we already use for this
 
00:44:25.030 --> 00:44:25.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:26.870 --> 00:44:26.880 align:start position:0%
could the fiscal committee do that if
 
00:44:29.349 --> 00:44:29.359 align:start position:0%
the words public funds were stricken
 
00:44:32.069 --> 00:44:32.079 align:start position:0%
from line 14
 
00:44:33.990 --> 00:44:34.000 align:start position:0%
yes because it also says or any other
 
00:44:37.670 --> 00:44:37.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:40.790 --> 00:44:40.800 align:start position:0%
representative wallner your hand is up
 
00:44:43.910 --> 00:44:43.920 align:start position:0%
yes karen would we start to see in the
 
00:44:43.920 --> 00:44:45.270 align:start position:0%
yes karen would we start to see in the
budget

00:44:45.270 --> 00:44:45.280 align:start position:0%
budget
 
00:44:48.150 --> 00:44:48.160 align:start position:0%
a line where it would be i labeled i
 
00:44:50.470 --> 00:44:50.480 align:start position:0%
guess emergency funds
 
00:44:52.870 --> 00:44:52.880 align:start position:0%
we start to see that line in the budget
 
00:44:54.230 --> 00:44:54.240 align:start position:0%
where now
 
00:44:55.829 --> 00:44:55.839 align:start position:0%
we don't see it
 
00:44:58.710 --> 00:44:58.720 align:start position:0%
correct correct and right now it's just
 
00:44:58.720 --> 00:44:59.750 align:start position:0%
correct correct and right now it's just
within

00:44:59.750 --> 00:44:59.760 align:start position:0%
within
 
00:45:03.109 --> 00:45:03.119 align:start position:0%
another class line of 2958 this would we
 
00:45:05.030 --> 00:45:05.040 align:start position:0%
would either put it in its own separate
 
00:45:06.950 --> 00:45:06.960 align:start position:0%
accounting unit or put it in its own
 
00:45:10.390 --> 00:45:10.400 align:start position:0%
class line in 2958
 
00:45:12.870 --> 00:45:12.880 align:start position:0%
and just to follow up so it would
 
00:45:15.349 --> 00:45:15.359 align:start position:0%
possibly be the general funds that are
 
00:45:17.670 --> 00:45:17.680 align:start position:0%
showing up someplace else that we really
 
00:45:17.680 --> 00:45:18.790 align:start position:0%
showing up someplace else that we really
don't

00:45:18.790 --> 00:45:18.800 align:start position:0%
don't
 
00:45:20.870 --> 00:45:20.880 align:start position:0%
know exactly what they're
 
00:45:23.030 --> 00:45:23.040 align:start position:0%
that they're in there so those would be
 
00:45:24.470 --> 00:45:24.480 align:start position:0%
there and then
 
00:45:24.480 --> 00:45:25.430 align:start position:0%
there and then
if

00:45:25.430 --> 00:45:25.440 align:start position:0%
if
 
00:45:27.270 --> 00:45:27.280 align:start position:0%
you did receive
 
00:45:29.589 --> 00:45:29.599 align:start position:0%
donations from
 
00:45:32.069 --> 00:45:32.079 align:start position:0%
organizations or individuals who wanted
 
00:45:34.090 --> 00:45:34.100 align:start position:0%
to be sure to help um
 
00:45:34.100 --> 00:45:36.870 align:start position:0%
to be sure to help um
[Music]

00:45:36.870 --> 00:45:36.880 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:45:39.430 --> 00:45:39.440 align:start position:0%
children in an emergency situation those
 
00:45:41.030 --> 00:45:41.040 align:start position:0%
would go there so they would be the
 
00:45:43.349 --> 00:45:43.359 align:start position:0%
public would be able to see that those
 
00:45:45.910 --> 00:45:45.920 align:start position:0%
funds were going to that emergency fund
 
00:45:47.750 --> 00:45:47.760 align:start position:0%
and not just dump into the regular
 
00:45:50.069 --> 00:45:50.079 align:start position:0%
budget correct and
 
00:45:50.079 --> 00:45:50.950 align:start position:0%
budget correct and
those

00:45:50.950 --> 00:45:50.960 align:start position:0%
those
 
00:45:52.470 --> 00:45:52.480 align:start position:0%
this account
 
00:45:54.230 --> 00:45:54.240 align:start position:0%
it's established as a revolving account
 
00:45:55.349 --> 00:45:55.359 align:start position:0%
so it would be
 
00:45:57.430 --> 00:45:57.440 align:start position:0%
non-lapsed and continuously appropriated
 
00:45:59.190 --> 00:45:59.200 align:start position:0%
so those donations that were that would
 
00:46:01.430 --> 00:46:01.440 align:start position:0%
be made to this fund could not be moved
 
00:46:03.190 --> 00:46:03.200 align:start position:0%
for any other purpose and would not be
 
00:46:05.589 --> 00:46:05.599 align:start position:0%
lapsed they they would be there until
 
00:46:07.589 --> 00:46:07.599 align:start position:0%
they were spent
 
00:46:08.790 --> 00:46:08.800 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:46:12.550 --> 00:46:12.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:14.470 --> 00:46:14.480 align:start position:0%
thank you um i think
 
00:46:18.470 --> 00:46:18.480 align:start position:0%
bottom line is this is a transparency
 
00:46:18.480 --> 00:46:20.790 align:start position:0%
bottom line is this is a transparency
transparency

00:46:20.790 --> 00:46:20.800 align:start position:0%
transparency
 
00:46:23.990 --> 00:46:24.000 align:start position:0%
so that the public has knowledge of
 
00:46:26.150 --> 00:46:26.160 align:start position:0%
where the money's come from and where
 
00:46:30.390 --> 00:46:30.400 align:start position:0%
it's gone this is something we would be
 
00:46:31.750 --> 00:46:31.760 align:start position:0%
wise to
 
00:46:37.190 --> 00:46:37.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:38.950 --> 00:46:38.960 align:start position:0%
thank you for that
 
00:46:41.030 --> 00:46:41.040 align:start position:0%
i'm generally
 
00:46:43.270 --> 00:46:43.280 align:start position:0%
thinking i'm agreeing with you
 
00:46:47.349 --> 00:46:47.359 align:start position:0%
and now i'm down deep into the weeds um
 
00:46:49.589 --> 00:46:49.599 align:start position:0%
so so let me say this back to you miss
 
00:46:51.349 --> 00:46:51.359 align:start position:0%
your hand is still up represent waller
 
00:46:55.030 --> 00:46:55.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:56.870 --> 00:46:56.880 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
00:46:58.630 --> 00:46:58.640 align:start position:0%
so i'm i just want to make sure i'm
 
00:47:01.910 --> 00:47:01.920 align:start position:0%
getting this clear if we on line 14 if
 
00:47:03.270 --> 00:47:03.280 align:start position:0%
we struck the
 
00:47:05.990 --> 00:47:06.000 align:start position:0%
term public funds from it
 
00:47:08.790 --> 00:47:08.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:10.790 --> 00:47:10.800 align:start position:0%
that would have the effect
 
00:47:13.430 --> 00:47:13.440 align:start position:0%
of taking it out of our normal two-year
 
00:47:16.150 --> 00:47:16.160 align:start position:0%
budgeting process we wouldn't be
 
00:47:18.790 --> 00:47:18.800 align:start position:0%
putting money into it on our two-year
 
00:47:20.790 --> 00:47:20.800 align:start position:0%
budgeting process
 
00:47:24.230 --> 00:47:24.240 align:start position:0%
but if for some reason there was a money
 
00:47:26.630 --> 00:47:26.640 align:start position:0%
available that the department wanted to
 
00:47:29.829 --> 00:47:29.839 align:start position:0%
transfer general funds into this account
 
00:47:31.670 --> 00:47:31.680 align:start position:0%
they would still have a mechanism for
 
00:47:33.829 --> 00:47:33.839 align:start position:0%
doing that by going to the joint fiscal
 
00:47:33.839 --> 00:47:35.030 align:start position:0%
doing that by going to the joint fiscal
committee

00:47:35.030 --> 00:47:35.040 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:47:35.040 --> 00:47:35.829 align:start position:0%
committee
and

00:47:35.829 --> 00:47:35.839 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:47:37.990 --> 00:47:38.000 align:start position:0%
under the the part of this that says
 
00:47:41.109 --> 00:47:41.119 align:start position:0%
that the it can accept any other source
 
00:47:42.309 --> 00:47:42.319 align:start position:0%
of funds
 
00:47:45.190 --> 00:47:45.200 align:start position:0%
the joint legislative fiscal committee
 
00:47:47.270 --> 00:47:47.280 align:start position:0%
would would have the authority to move
 
00:47:50.390 --> 00:47:50.400 align:start position:0%
general funds into this new fund is
 
00:47:53.190 --> 00:47:53.200 align:start position:0%
is that correct i don't i don't think
 
00:47:55.270 --> 00:47:55.280 align:start position:0%
that removing public funds would would
 
00:47:57.270 --> 00:47:57.280 align:start position:0%
keep it from being in the two-year
 
00:47:59.670 --> 00:47:59.680 align:start position:0%
budget cycle i think it's still
 
00:48:01.750 --> 00:48:01.760 align:start position:0%
we have other revolving funds some that
 
00:48:03.829 --> 00:48:03.839 align:start position:0%
have no general funds we still put it in
 
00:48:06.309 --> 00:48:06.319 align:start position:0%
the two-year budget cycle and budget
 
00:48:08.870 --> 00:48:08.880 align:start position:0%
funds in it so i don't and i don't think
 
00:48:10.230 --> 00:48:10.240 align:start position:0%
it would restrict us from budgeting
 
00:48:14.710 --> 00:48:14.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:16.150 --> 00:48:16.160 align:start position:0%
i mean i would defer to kevin a little
 
00:48:19.030 --> 00:48:19.040 align:start position:0%
bit but i i don't think it would
 
00:48:21.030 --> 00:48:21.040 align:start position:0%
no i i agree with that i think as long
 
00:48:23.270 --> 00:48:23.280 align:start position:0%
as it says any other source of funds
 
00:48:25.589 --> 00:48:25.599 align:start position:0%
that could include
 
00:48:27.430 --> 00:48:27.440 align:start position:0%
funds or any other appropriation that
 
00:48:33.030 --> 00:48:33.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:35.270 --> 00:48:35.280 align:start position:0%
but it would be the
 
00:48:37.030 --> 00:48:37.040 align:start position:0%
you would see it as a separate class
 
00:48:38.950 --> 00:48:38.960 align:start position:0%
line or a separate accounting unit so
 
00:48:40.870 --> 00:48:40.880 align:start position:0%
you would see if we were we were
 
00:48:43.030 --> 00:48:43.040 align:start position:0%
budgeting funds into this account it
 
00:48:45.109 --> 00:48:45.119 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be
 
00:48:48.630 --> 00:48:48.640 align:start position:0%
okay so so i so given that i i like the
 
00:48:51.670 --> 00:48:51.680 align:start position:0%
general idea uh why am i asking these
 
00:48:54.549 --> 00:48:54.559 align:start position:0%
kinds of questions it's because
 
00:48:56.390 --> 00:48:56.400 align:start position:0%
every time we open up a revolving
 
00:48:58.790 --> 00:48:58.800 align:start position:0%
account we're essentially
 
00:48:58.800 --> 00:49:00.309 align:start position:0%
account we're essentially
obligating

00:49:00.309 --> 00:49:00.319 align:start position:0%
obligating
 
00:49:03.030 --> 00:49:03.040 align:start position:0%
future legislatures because once the
 
00:49:04.630 --> 00:49:04.640 align:start position:0%
money gets in there
 
00:49:07.030 --> 00:49:07.040 align:start position:0%
future legislatures aren't going to
 
00:49:09.510 --> 00:49:09.520 align:start position:0%
reach into this revolving fund and pull
 
00:49:11.109 --> 00:49:11.119 align:start position:0%
money out and so
 
00:49:11.119 --> 00:49:12.710 align:start position:0%
money out and so
we're

00:49:12.710 --> 00:49:12.720 align:start position:0%
we're
 
00:49:15.910 --> 00:49:15.920 align:start position:0%
we're sort of put inserting ourselves
 
00:49:18.390 --> 00:49:18.400 align:start position:0%
into this category of
 
00:49:20.390 --> 00:49:20.400 align:start position:0%
of permanency
 
00:49:22.150 --> 00:49:22.160 align:start position:0%
that i don't think is appropriate for
 
00:49:24.150 --> 00:49:24.160 align:start position:0%
one legislature to
 
00:49:25.510 --> 00:49:25.520 align:start position:0%
find another
 
00:49:25.520 --> 00:49:27.030 align:start position:0%
find another
so

00:49:27.030 --> 00:49:27.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:49:29.349 --> 00:49:29.359 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm just i'm just a little concerned
 
00:49:31.190 --> 00:49:31.200 align:start position:0%
about the impact of this
 
00:49:31.200 --> 00:49:32.549 align:start position:0%
about the impact of this
um

00:49:32.549 --> 00:49:32.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:49:32.559 --> 00:49:33.589 align:start position:0%
um
so

00:49:33.589 --> 00:49:33.599 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:49:35.589 --> 00:49:35.599 align:start position:0%
i i'd like to
 
00:49:38.069 --> 00:49:38.079 align:start position:0%
go ahead uh representative morgan
 
00:49:40.150 --> 00:49:40.160 align:start position:0%
no i just want to clarify this is
 
00:49:42.390 --> 00:49:42.400 align:start position:0%
setting up a process
 
00:49:44.710 --> 00:49:44.720 align:start position:0%
a public process
 
00:49:47.349 --> 00:49:47.359 align:start position:0%
for money that
 
00:49:50.470 --> 00:49:50.480 align:start position:0%
would otherwise probably be hidden
 
00:49:52.870 --> 00:49:52.880 align:start position:0%
from everyone knowing what was coming
 
00:49:54.950 --> 00:49:54.960 align:start position:0%
and going is this setting up a
 
00:49:59.430 --> 00:49:59.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:01.750 --> 00:50:01.760 align:start position:0%
yes ma'am and i love that part of it and
 
00:50:03.910 --> 00:50:03.920 align:start position:0%
if and if this only said gifts grants or
 
00:50:03.920 --> 00:50:05.190 align:start position:0%
if and if this only said gifts grants or
donations

00:50:05.190 --> 00:50:05.200 align:start position:0%
donations
 
00:50:08.390 --> 00:50:08.400 align:start position:0%
i i'd already be ready to move on it's
 
00:50:10.710 --> 00:50:10.720 align:start position:0%
it's it's the idea that we could put
 
00:50:12.710 --> 00:50:12.720 align:start position:0%
general money general funds money into
 
00:50:15.030 --> 00:50:15.040 align:start position:0%
this and that it would have this sort of
 
00:50:15.040 --> 00:50:16.230 align:start position:0%
this and that it would have this sort of
multi

00:50:16.230 --> 00:50:16.240 align:start position:0%
multi
 
00:50:19.190 --> 00:50:19.200 align:start position:0%
biennium budget effect that is the thing
 
00:50:21.349 --> 00:50:21.359 align:start position:0%
that i'm trying to wrap my head around
 
00:50:23.750 --> 00:50:23.760 align:start position:0%
because i don't think one legislature
 
00:50:26.790 --> 00:50:26.800 align:start position:0%
should should should bind the decisions
 
00:50:26.800 --> 00:50:27.510 align:start position:0%
should should should bind the decisions
of

00:50:27.510 --> 00:50:27.520 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:50:30.710 --> 00:50:30.720 align:start position:0%
coming legislatures but so um
 
00:50:32.309 --> 00:50:32.319 align:start position:0%
representative erf if you had your hand
 
00:50:34.069 --> 00:50:34.079 align:start position:0%
up and then represented walnut will come
 
00:50:35.109 --> 00:50:35.119 align:start position:0%
to you
 
00:50:37.589 --> 00:50:37.599 align:start position:0%
i just have a quick question for karen
 
00:50:39.990 --> 00:50:40.000 align:start position:0%
how would we see
 
00:50:41.430 --> 00:50:41.440 align:start position:0%
general funds
 
00:50:43.510 --> 00:50:43.520 align:start position:0%
being allocated to a revolving fund i
 
00:50:44.790 --> 00:50:44.800 align:start position:0%
just don't recall
 
00:50:47.109 --> 00:50:47.119 align:start position:0%
running into that in the budget process
 
00:50:48.549 --> 00:50:48.559 align:start position:0%
sure it would be
 
00:50:51.109 --> 00:50:51.119 align:start position:0%
either in its own accounting unit or
 
00:50:52.950 --> 00:50:52.960 align:start position:0%
in its own class line
 
00:50:55.030 --> 00:50:55.040 align:start position:0%
and the revenue source is typically
 
00:50:57.349 --> 00:50:57.359 align:start position:0%
revolving funds at the bottom so like
 
00:51:00.150 --> 00:51:00.160 align:start position:0%
the vaccine fund i think says revolving
 
00:51:02.470 --> 00:51:02.480 align:start position:0%
funds if i remember correctly
 
00:51:04.950 --> 00:51:04.960 align:start position:0%
there's a couple um
 
00:51:06.870 --> 00:51:06.880 align:start position:0%
that have the revenue sources revolving
 
00:51:06.880 --> 00:51:10.230 align:start position:0%
that have the revenue sources revolving
funds

00:51:10.230 --> 00:51:10.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:10.240 --> 00:51:11.030 align:start position:0%
 
oh

00:51:11.030 --> 00:51:11.040 align:start position:0%
oh
 
00:51:11.040 --> 00:51:13.270 align:start position:0%
oh
okay

00:51:13.270 --> 00:51:13.280 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:51:15.990 --> 00:51:16.000 align:start position:0%
so the red the vaccines says this is
 
00:51:19.430 --> 00:51:19.440 align:start position:0%
5177. it says funding revolving funds
 
00:51:21.270 --> 00:51:21.280 align:start position:0%
and then it as general funds zero so
 
00:51:22.790 --> 00:51:22.800 align:start position:0%
that oh that would always show up the
 
00:51:24.309 --> 00:51:24.319 align:start position:0%
general fund's zeroed we're giving an
 
00:51:25.990 --> 00:51:26.000 align:start position:0%
indication that general funds could go
 
00:51:27.349 --> 00:51:27.359 align:start position:0%
into that account
 
00:51:30.309 --> 00:51:30.319 align:start position:0%
right but the um if there are not any
 
00:51:32.470 --> 00:51:32.480 align:start position:0%
budgeted there's not any budgeting okay
 
00:51:33.829 --> 00:51:33.839 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:51:33.839 --> 00:51:37.750 align:start position:0%
thank you
representative

00:51:37.750 --> 00:51:37.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:39.670 --> 00:51:39.680 align:start position:0%
sorry i got sidetracked i had somebody
 
00:51:41.430 --> 00:51:41.440 align:start position:0%
else ask me a question here in the house
 
00:51:43.829 --> 00:51:43.839 align:start position:0%
so i got sidetracked but karen we're
 
00:51:46.390 --> 00:51:46.400 align:start position:0%
already we're already appropriating
 
00:51:47.910 --> 00:51:47.920 align:start position:0%
money for this purpose isn't that
 
00:51:50.390 --> 00:51:50.400 align:start position:0%
correct that's correct
 
00:51:51.990 --> 00:51:52.000 align:start position:0%
we are and so i
 
00:51:54.069 --> 00:51:54.079 align:start position:0%
this was a project of mine to try to
 
00:51:55.670 --> 00:51:55.680 align:start position:0%
make it more transparent and track it
 
00:51:55.680 --> 00:51:56.549 align:start position:0%
make it more transparent and track it
better

00:51:56.549 --> 00:51:56.559 align:start position:0%
better
 
00:51:59.270 --> 00:51:59.280 align:start position:0%
okay we just don't we just don't see it
 
00:51:59.280 --> 00:52:01.430 align:start position:0%
okay we just don't we just don't see it
correct

00:52:01.430 --> 00:52:01.440 align:start position:0%
correct
 
00:52:01.440 --> 00:52:02.309 align:start position:0%
correct
so

00:52:02.309 --> 00:52:02.319 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:52:05.109 --> 00:52:05.119 align:start position:0%
okay it's about 50 000 a year it's not a
 
00:52:06.950 --> 00:52:06.960 align:start position:0%
significant amount of money
 
00:52:09.829 --> 00:52:09.839 align:start position:0%
um but it's just something that given
 
00:52:11.670 --> 00:52:11.680 align:start position:0%
the type of expenditure it's something
 
00:52:13.270 --> 00:52:13.280 align:start position:0%
that it's good to have good controls
 
00:52:13.280 --> 00:52:14.549 align:start position:0%
that it's good to have good controls
over

00:52:14.549 --> 00:52:14.559 align:start position:0%
over
 
00:52:16.870 --> 00:52:16.880 align:start position:0%
right thank you very much
 
00:52:20.790 --> 00:52:20.800 align:start position:0%
and so in your view it's it it
 
00:52:23.270 --> 00:52:23.280 align:start position:0%
although the term public funds is
 
00:52:25.670 --> 00:52:25.680 align:start position:0%
redundant because we say any other
 
00:52:27.349 --> 00:52:27.359 align:start position:0%
source of funds
 
00:52:29.109 --> 00:52:29.119 align:start position:0%
it it
 
00:52:30.549 --> 00:52:30.559 align:start position:0%
would be your position that we should
 
00:52:34.230 --> 00:52:34.240 align:start position:0%
keep the phrase public funds in there
 
00:52:36.549 --> 00:52:36.559 align:start position:0%
i i mean i i don't
 
00:52:37.910 --> 00:52:37.920 align:start position:0%
i don't think it matters if you leave it
 
00:52:39.670 --> 00:52:39.680 align:start position:0%
or take it out
 
00:52:41.190 --> 00:52:41.200 align:start position:0%
as long as it says any other source of
 
00:52:41.200 --> 00:52:42.870 align:start position:0%
as long as it says any other source of
funds

00:52:42.870 --> 00:52:42.880 align:start position:0%
funds
 
00:52:45.270 --> 00:52:45.280 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
00:52:48.549 --> 00:52:48.559 align:start position:0%
about section 29 we we did we did bring
 
00:52:50.549 --> 00:52:50.559 align:start position:0%
it forward from tomorrow
 
00:52:54.150 --> 00:52:54.160 align:start position:0%
um but are there any other questions
 
00:53:01.750 --> 00:53:01.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:03.430 --> 00:53:03.440 align:start position:0%
i'm not i'm not seeing any from the
 
00:53:06.470 --> 00:53:06.480 align:start position:0%
committee so
 
00:53:06.480 --> 00:53:07.510 align:start position:0%
committee so
what

00:53:07.510 --> 00:53:07.520 align:start position:0%
what
 
00:53:10.710 --> 00:53:10.720 align:start position:0%
what i'm thinking we can do and and uh
 
00:53:13.990 --> 00:53:14.000 align:start position:0%
mr ripple if if you've got a
 
00:53:16.630 --> 00:53:16.640 align:start position:0%
a pencil to write some of this down
 
00:53:19.430 --> 00:53:19.440 align:start position:0%
i i think i think i'd like to
 
00:53:21.030 --> 00:53:21.040 align:start position:0%
have us
 
00:53:23.349 --> 00:53:23.359 align:start position:0%
entertain and debate a motion
 
00:53:23.359 --> 00:53:24.230 align:start position:0%
entertain and debate a motion
on

00:53:24.230 --> 00:53:24.240 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:53:27.030 --> 00:53:27.040 align:start position:0%
having the committee accept
 
00:53:27.040 --> 00:53:28.470 align:start position:0%
having the committee accept
sections

00:53:28.470 --> 00:53:28.480 align:start position:0%
sections
 
00:53:28.480 --> 00:53:33.670 align:start position:0%
sections
21

00:53:33.670 --> 00:53:33.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:33.680 --> 00:53:43.349 align:start position:0%
 
23

00:53:43.349 --> 00:53:43.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:46.470 --> 00:53:46.480 align:start position:0%
28 and 29.
 
00:53:46.480 --> 00:53:49.990 align:start position:0%
28 and 29.
okay

00:53:49.990 --> 00:53:50.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:51.430 --> 00:53:51.440 align:start position:0%
in other words
 
00:53:53.190 --> 00:53:53.200 align:start position:0%
i think we need to
 
00:53:55.349 --> 00:53:55.359 align:start position:0%
talk more today about the county
 
00:53:58.950 --> 00:53:58.960 align:start position:0%
reimbursement the section 24.
 
00:54:01.589 --> 00:54:01.599 align:start position:0%
and i think on section 25 we said we
 
00:54:02.870 --> 00:54:02.880 align:start position:0%
wanted to see
 
00:54:05.270 --> 00:54:05.280 align:start position:0%
uh mr williams language and and i
 
00:54:08.549 --> 00:54:08.559 align:start position:0%
personally want to go read the
 
00:54:08.559 --> 00:54:09.589 align:start position:0%
personally want to go read the
rsa

00:54:09.589 --> 00:54:09.599 align:start position:0%
rsa
 
00:54:11.750 --> 00:54:11.760 align:start position:0%
section more closely
 
00:54:11.760 --> 00:54:12.710 align:start position:0%
section more closely
so

00:54:12.710 --> 00:54:12.720 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:54:17.109 --> 00:54:17.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:19.270 --> 00:54:19.280 align:start position:0%
i would like to entertain a motion mr
 
00:54:21.510 --> 00:54:21.520 align:start position:0%
vice chair on
 
00:54:25.109 --> 00:54:25.119 align:start position:0%
whether or not uh the committee approves
 
00:54:28.549 --> 00:54:28.559 align:start position:0%
the four sections i just listed uh would
 
00:54:30.549 --> 00:54:30.559 align:start position:0%
you read them and back again mr ripple
 
00:54:35.270 --> 00:54:35.280 align:start position:0%
those four yep they're sections 21 23 28
 
00:54:41.510 --> 00:54:41.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:43.910 --> 00:54:43.920 align:start position:0%
okay so just so i'm clear you weren't in
 
00:54:45.270 --> 00:54:45.280 align:start position:0%
the previous conversation putting those
 
00:54:46.470 --> 00:54:46.480 align:start position:0%
off for another day you wanted to make
 
00:54:48.309 --> 00:54:48.319 align:start position:0%
the motion now is that correct
 
00:54:50.630 --> 00:54:50.640 align:start position:0%
these there are there we've gone over
 
00:54:53.430 --> 00:54:53.440 align:start position:0%
six sections four of them i think
 
00:54:55.829 --> 00:54:55.839 align:start position:0%
it feels like we're ready to vote on two
 
00:54:59.109 --> 00:54:59.119 align:start position:0%
of them were deferring okay so
 
00:55:02.230 --> 00:55:02.240 align:start position:0%
i'd like to move that we
 
00:55:05.030 --> 00:55:05.040 align:start position:0%
support item number 23 and hb2 keeping
 
00:55:06.789 --> 00:55:06.799 align:start position:0%
it in the
 
00:55:09.670 --> 00:55:09.680 align:start position:0%
in hb2 as written
 
00:55:11.510 --> 00:55:11.520 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry sorry the wrong number but
 
00:55:12.870 --> 00:55:12.880 align:start position:0%
going backwards
 
00:55:16.230 --> 00:55:16.240 align:start position:0%
same thing with number 21 in hb2
 
00:55:18.069 --> 00:55:18.079 align:start position:0%
and the same thing with numbers 28 and
 
00:55:23.349 --> 00:55:23.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:26.789 --> 00:55:26.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:29.430 --> 00:55:29.440 align:start position:0%
uh representative seconds
 
00:55:32.390 --> 00:55:32.400 align:start position:0%
is there any discussion on the motion
 
00:55:36.150 --> 00:55:36.160 align:start position:0%
which again is we're we're about to vote
 
00:55:38.150 --> 00:55:38.160 align:start position:0%
on whether or not we accept
 
00:55:41.430 --> 00:55:41.440 align:start position:0%
sections uh say them again mr ripple
 
00:55:43.030 --> 00:55:43.040 align:start position:0%
because i don't want to screw it up
 
00:55:50.470 --> 00:55:50.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:52.470 --> 00:55:52.480 align:start position:0%
so is there any discussion on whether or
 
00:55:53.829 --> 00:55:53.839 align:start position:0%
not we accept
 
00:55:58.150 --> 00:55:58.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:00.230 --> 00:56:00.240 align:start position:0%
i'm not seeing any
 
00:56:04.069 --> 00:56:04.079 align:start position:0%
so mr clerk are you ready to take a roll
 
00:56:07.990 --> 00:56:08.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:09.990 --> 00:56:10.000 align:start position:0%
all right on the motion
 
00:56:11.750 --> 00:56:11.760 align:start position:0%
if you're in favor you'll say yes if i
 
00:56:13.030 --> 00:56:13.040 align:start position:0%
oppose no

um
 
00:56:49.359 --> 00:56:52.470 align:start position:0%
um
so

00:56:52.470 --> 00:56:52.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:55.270 --> 00:56:55.280 align:start position:0%
we want to take a break at 12 15 so we
 
00:56:59.990 --> 00:57:00.000 align:start position:0%
still have uh plenty of time um
 
00:57:02.630 --> 00:57:02.640 align:start position:0%
let's let's improvise a little bit and
 
00:57:06.150 --> 00:57:06.160 align:start position:0%
drop down to section 106 please
 
00:57:07.990 --> 00:57:08.000 align:start position:0%
can you can you do that on your screen
 
00:57:09.270 --> 00:57:09.280 align:start position:0%
mr ripple
 
00:57:29.750 --> 00:57:29.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:33.910 --> 00:57:33.920 align:start position:0%
what what page on you're on page 51
 
00:57:33.920 --> 00:57:36.710 align:start position:0%
what what page on you're on page 51
46

00:57:36.710 --> 00:57:36.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:38.829 --> 00:57:38.839 align:start position:0%
yeah i was looking at the pdf
 
00:57:38.839 --> 00:57:40.789 align:start position:0%
yeah i was looking at the pdf
number

00:57:40.789 --> 00:57:40.799 align:start position:0%
number
 
00:57:40.799 --> 00:57:41.829 align:start position:0%
number
okay

00:57:41.829 --> 00:57:41.839 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:57:41.839 --> 00:57:42.630 align:start position:0%
okay
so

00:57:42.630 --> 00:57:42.640 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:57:42.640 --> 00:57:44.870 align:start position:0%
so
um

00:57:44.870 --> 00:57:44.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:57:49.829 --> 00:57:49.839 align:start position:0%
these are three hb2 line items
 
00:57:52.150 --> 00:57:52.160 align:start position:0%
from the veterans home
 
00:57:52.160 --> 00:57:53.430 align:start position:0%
from the veterans home
these

00:57:53.430 --> 00:57:53.440 align:start position:0%
these
 
00:57:53.440 --> 00:57:54.549 align:start position:0%
these
sound

00:57:54.549 --> 00:57:54.559 align:start position:0%
sound
 
00:57:59.190 --> 00:57:59.200 align:start position:0%
like they've all been in previous hb2s
 
00:58:01.990 --> 00:58:02.000 align:start position:0%
in that these in combination with with
 
00:58:03.349 --> 00:58:03.359 align:start position:0%
one another
 
00:58:07.510 --> 00:58:07.520 align:start position:0%
give the commandant flexibility to
 
00:58:10.710 --> 00:58:10.720 align:start position:0%
use personnel money and personnel slots
 
00:58:12.230 --> 00:58:12.240 align:start position:0%
uh to
 
00:58:14.230 --> 00:58:14.240 align:start position:0%
do what she needs to do to get people
 
00:58:16.950 --> 00:58:16.960 align:start position:0%
there at the bedside whether it's via
 
00:58:19.510 --> 00:58:19.520 align:start position:0%
contracts or per diems or
 
00:58:20.829 --> 00:58:20.839 align:start position:0%
or whatever
 
00:58:23.510 --> 00:58:23.520 align:start position:0%
so um
 
00:58:25.910 --> 00:58:25.920 align:start position:0%
so i'm because we're we're sort of
 
00:58:28.230 --> 00:58:28.240 align:start position:0%
accelerating this and these are not on
 
00:58:29.750 --> 00:58:29.760 align:start position:0%
the schedule
 
00:58:32.309 --> 00:58:32.319 align:start position:0%
i did want to just introduce them and
 
00:58:33.910 --> 00:58:33.920 align:start position:0%
have us
 
00:58:37.270 --> 00:58:37.280 align:start position:0%
take a look at it and and for you more
 
00:58:38.950 --> 00:58:38.960 align:start position:0%
experienced people
 
00:58:40.789 --> 00:58:40.799 align:start position:0%
you've probably seen this language
 
00:58:40.799 --> 00:58:41.750 align:start position:0%
you've probably seen this language
before

00:58:41.750 --> 00:58:41.760 align:start position:0%
before
 
00:58:45.190 --> 00:58:45.200 align:start position:0%
so so mr ripple would you
 
00:58:47.349 --> 00:58:47.359 align:start position:0%
can you confirm
 
00:58:48.870 --> 00:58:48.880 align:start position:0%
i am putting you on the spike but can
 
00:58:51.510 --> 00:58:51.520 align:start position:0%
you confirm that these three sections
 
00:58:55.670 --> 00:58:55.680 align:start position:0%
have been in previous hb2s as written
 
00:58:57.430 --> 00:58:57.440 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure that the veterans home has
 
00:58:59.750 --> 00:58:59.760 align:start position:0%
had section 106 before the unfunded
 
00:59:03.030 --> 00:59:03.040 align:start position:0%
positions they have had 107. sorry i
 
00:59:04.870 --> 00:59:04.880 align:start position:0%
just lost it the transfer among accounts
 
00:59:06.470 --> 00:59:06.480 align:start position:0%
and classes
 
00:59:09.510 --> 00:59:09.520 align:start position:0%
i would just comment here that they also
 
00:59:13.109 --> 00:59:13.119 align:start position:0%
have sections 108 through 110 which are
 
00:59:16.150 --> 00:59:16.160 align:start position:0%
duplicative of language elsewhere
 
00:59:18.870 --> 00:59:18.880 align:start position:0%
either in house bill 1 or in section
 
00:59:18.880 --> 00:59:20.230 align:start position:0%
either in house bill 1 or in section
106.

00:59:20.230 --> 00:59:20.240 align:start position:0%
106.
 
00:59:21.990 --> 00:59:22.000 align:start position:0%
what i mean by that is
 
00:59:24.950 --> 00:59:24.960 align:start position:0%
we go down to section 109
 
00:59:27.270 --> 00:59:27.280 align:start position:0%
you can see on line 8
 
00:59:30.390 --> 00:59:30.400 align:start position:0%
it refers to a waiver from rsa 917 a
 
00:59:30.400 --> 00:59:33.910 align:start position:0%
it refers to a waiver from rsa 917 a
limitations

00:59:33.910 --> 00:59:33.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:37.829 --> 00:59:37.839 align:start position:0%
if you go back up to section 107
 
00:59:42.630 --> 00:59:42.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:42.640 --> 00:59:43.750 align:start position:0%
 
like

00:59:43.750 --> 00:59:43.760 align:start position:0%
like
 
00:59:45.670 --> 00:59:45.680 align:start position:0%
section 1010 refers to a waiver from
 
00:59:45.680 --> 00:59:47.750 align:start position:0%
section 1010 refers to a waiver from
rsa917c

00:59:47.750 --> 00:59:47.760 align:start position:0%
rsa917c
 
00:59:50.309 --> 00:59:50.319 align:start position:0%
that can be found on line 35.
 
00:59:52.069 --> 00:59:52.079 align:start position:0%
so i think if you were to accept section
 
00:59:54.710 --> 00:59:54.720 align:start position:0%
107 it's in its entirety
 
00:59:57.190 --> 00:59:57.200 align:start position:0%
you could remove sections 109 and 110
 
01:00:01.030 --> 01:00:01.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:02.950 --> 01:00:02.960 align:start position:0%
and also
 
01:00:05.190 --> 01:00:05.200 align:start position:0%
section 108 here on line one per diem
 
01:00:07.589 --> 01:00:07.599 align:start position:0%
payments this reads the same as the
 
01:00:09.430 --> 01:00:09.440 align:start position:0%
class note
 
01:00:10.789 --> 01:00:10.799 align:start position:0%
that is in house bill 1 that the
 
01:00:13.109 --> 01:00:13.119 align:start position:0%
veterans home talked about the other day
 
01:00:15.829 --> 01:00:15.839 align:start position:0%
so i think you could remove that as well
 
01:00:18.470 --> 01:00:18.480 align:start position:0%
or we could move remove the class node
 
01:00:18.480 --> 01:00:19.270 align:start position:0%
or we could move remove the class node
yep

01:00:19.270 --> 01:00:19.280 align:start position:0%
yep
 
01:00:20.630 --> 01:00:20.640 align:start position:0%
either way
 
01:00:20.640 --> 01:00:21.589 align:start position:0%
either way
so

01:00:21.589 --> 01:00:21.599 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:00:24.069 --> 01:00:24.079 align:start position:0%
so as as the new guy
 
01:00:26.069 --> 01:00:26.079 align:start position:0%
i think i'd rather remove the class
 
01:00:28.390 --> 01:00:28.400 align:start position:0%
nodes because hb2
 
01:00:30.710 --> 01:00:30.720 align:start position:0%
is more visible
 
01:00:32.630 --> 01:00:32.640 align:start position:0%
to the public and therefore
 
01:00:35.430 --> 01:00:35.440 align:start position:0%
we would have a more transparent policy
 
01:00:37.430 --> 01:00:37.440 align:start position:0%
if it was an hb2 and removed from the
 
01:00:38.789 --> 01:00:38.799 align:start position:0%
class nodes
 
01:00:43.109 --> 01:00:43.119 align:start position:0%
is that correct or wrong
 
01:00:44.789 --> 01:00:44.799 align:start position:0%
well well i'm not sure which is more
 
01:00:46.789 --> 01:00:46.799 align:start position:0%
transparent they both have the force of
 
01:00:49.829 --> 01:00:49.839 align:start position:0%
law so either one would work
 
01:00:51.829 --> 01:00:51.839 align:start position:0%
but for transparency where the public
 
01:00:53.829 --> 01:00:53.839 align:start position:0%
can readily look at it and know what
 
01:00:55.109 --> 01:00:55.119 align:start position:0%
we're doing
 
01:00:56.710 --> 01:00:56.720 align:start position:0%
which one is more
 
01:00:59.910 --> 01:00:59.920 align:start position:0%
transparent to the public
 
01:01:01.750 --> 01:01:01.760 align:start position:0%
well i'm not sure which bill the public
 
01:01:05.270 --> 01:01:05.280 align:start position:0%
is more is more likely to look at
 
01:01:06.870 --> 01:01:06.880 align:start position:0%
so i don't really know the answer to
 
01:01:06.880 --> 01:01:08.150 align:start position:0%
so i don't really know the answer to
that

01:01:08.150 --> 01:01:08.160 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:01:10.309 --> 01:01:10.319 align:start position:0%
representative walner you had your hand
 
01:01:13.430 --> 01:01:13.440 align:start position:0%
up and then representative weiler
 
01:01:16.390 --> 01:01:16.400 align:start position:0%
i wondered i wondered how we um ended up
 
01:01:18.470 --> 01:01:18.480 align:start position:0%
in a situation where
 
01:01:21.430 --> 01:01:21.440 align:start position:0%
it was in both documents um
 
01:01:23.109 --> 01:01:23.119 align:start position:0%
there must have been a reason for it at
 
01:01:24.390 --> 01:01:24.400 align:start position:0%
the time
 
01:01:27.670 --> 01:01:27.680 align:start position:0%
the reason why it was in both documents
 
01:01:29.270 --> 01:01:29.280 align:start position:0%
do you know kevin
 
01:01:35.589 --> 01:01:35.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:35.599 --> 01:01:37.750 align:start position:0%
 
well

01:01:37.750 --> 01:01:37.760 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:01:39.510 --> 01:01:39.520 align:start position:0%
i remember seeing this when we were
 
01:01:41.430 --> 01:01:41.440 align:start position:0%
going through the veterans homeland
 
01:01:43.270 --> 01:01:43.280 align:start position:0%
earlier this week or
 
01:01:45.349 --> 01:01:45.359 align:start position:0%
maybe it was last week but anyway when
 
01:01:46.549 --> 01:01:46.559 align:start position:0%
we were going through the veterans home
 
01:01:49.109 --> 01:01:49.119 align:start position:0%
i remember seeing this on their line and
 
01:01:50.390 --> 01:01:50.400 align:start position:0%
i thought
 
01:01:52.470 --> 01:01:52.480 align:start position:0%
that that's that's sort of interesting
 
01:01:55.190 --> 01:01:55.200 align:start position:0%
because it's really sort of helpful
 
01:01:57.589 --> 01:01:57.599 align:start position:0%
because it pertained to that line in the
 
01:01:57.599 --> 01:01:58.870 align:start position:0%
because it pertained to that line in the
budget

01:01:58.870 --> 01:01:58.880 align:start position:0%
budget
 
01:02:00.390 --> 01:02:00.400 align:start position:0%
and it was kind of helped you'll see it
 
01:02:02.230 --> 01:02:02.240 align:start position:0%
right there
 
01:02:04.309 --> 01:02:04.319 align:start position:0%
if i didn't know to go looking and how
 
01:02:06.150 --> 01:02:06.160 align:start position:0%
if it wasn't there and i didn't know to
 
01:02:09.270 --> 01:02:09.280 align:start position:0%
go looking in house bill 2
 
01:02:10.630 --> 01:02:10.640 align:start position:0%
i probably
 
01:02:12.390 --> 01:02:12.400 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have ever known it was in house
 
01:02:14.950 --> 01:02:14.960 align:start position:0%
bill 2.
 
01:02:17.190 --> 01:02:17.200 align:start position:0%
so it seems like there's some benefit to
 
01:02:19.829 --> 01:02:19.839 align:start position:0%
having it in house bill 1.
 
01:02:19.839 --> 01:02:21.029 align:start position:0%
having it in house bill 1.
i'm

01:02:21.029 --> 01:02:21.039 align:start position:0%
i'm
 
01:02:23.029 --> 01:02:23.039 align:start position:0%
open to
 
01:02:24.470 --> 01:02:24.480 align:start position:0%
hearing other
 
01:02:26.230 --> 01:02:26.240 align:start position:0%
thoughts about it and i didn't know
 
01:02:28.069 --> 01:02:28.079 align:start position:0%
whether the commandant maybe had a
 
01:02:28.079 --> 01:02:30.390 align:start position:0%
whether the commandant maybe had a
preference

01:02:30.390 --> 01:02:30.400 align:start position:0%
preference
 
01:02:32.870 --> 01:02:32.880 align:start position:0%
so so i'm open to learning from you so
 
01:02:34.870 --> 01:02:34.880 align:start position:0%
what i think i just took away from your
 
01:02:38.470 --> 01:02:38.480 align:start position:0%
comment representative walner is is that
 
01:02:40.150 --> 01:02:40.160 align:start position:0%
you you you don't think it really should
 
01:02:42.390 --> 01:02:42.400 align:start position:0%
be in both places and if we were to
 
01:02:44.789 --> 01:02:44.799 align:start position:0%
choose one place you would want it in
 
01:02:48.789 --> 01:02:48.799 align:start position:0%
the organizational notes
 
01:02:50.710 --> 01:02:50.720 align:start position:0%
yes i think so
 
01:02:52.789 --> 01:02:52.799 align:start position:0%
representative weiler do you have a
 
01:02:55.190 --> 01:02:55.200 align:start position:0%
question sir or comment
 
01:02:56.870 --> 01:02:56.880 align:start position:0%
i was going to say the same thing that
 
01:02:58.789 --> 01:02:58.799 align:start position:0%
representative walnut just said if
 
01:03:00.549 --> 01:03:00.559 align:start position:0%
you're talking about transparency and
 
01:03:02.150 --> 01:03:02.160 align:start position:0%
someone's looking up a budget they'd
 
01:03:03.190 --> 01:03:03.200 align:start position:0%
look up
 
01:03:04.950 --> 01:03:04.960 align:start position:0%
you know the veterans home they wouldn't
 
01:03:05.910 --> 01:03:05.920 align:start position:0%
look in
 
01:03:07.670 --> 01:03:07.680 align:start position:0%
they wouldn't even imagine it being in
 
01:03:10.069 --> 01:03:10.079 align:start position:0%
hb2 so if you're looking up something
 
01:03:11.670 --> 01:03:11.680 align:start position:0%
about the veterans home you go to the
 
01:03:13.670 --> 01:03:13.680 align:start position:0%
budget first and then you see the the
 
01:03:16.069 --> 01:03:16.079 align:start position:0%
line note and that's that's far more
 
01:03:18.069 --> 01:03:18.079 align:start position:0%
transparent than as she said you
 
01:03:21.510 --> 01:03:21.520 align:start position:0%
wouldn't normally go looking in hb2
 
01:03:23.029 --> 01:03:23.039 align:start position:0%
representative walter your hand is still
 
01:03:24.390 --> 01:03:24.400 align:start position:0%
up or is it
 
01:03:27.510 --> 01:03:27.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:28.470 --> 01:03:28.480 align:start position:0%
all right
 
01:03:28.480 --> 01:03:29.430 align:start position:0%
all right
so

01:03:29.430 --> 01:03:29.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:03:29.440 --> 01:03:30.549 align:start position:0%
so
um

01:03:30.549 --> 01:03:30.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:03:33.190 --> 01:03:33.200 align:start position:0%
is does the veterans home
 
01:03:35.990 --> 01:03:36.000 align:start position:0%
send a legislative liaison do they have
 
01:03:37.430 --> 01:03:37.440 align:start position:0%
anyone actually
 
01:03:40.789 --> 01:03:40.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:44.390 --> 01:03:44.400 align:start position:0%
to hear us and to take comments
 
01:03:46.870 --> 01:03:46.880 align:start position:0%
i suspect they don't and i see no hands
 
01:03:50.630 --> 01:03:50.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:50.640 --> 01:03:51.510 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:03:51.510 --> 01:03:51.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:03:53.349 --> 01:03:53.359 align:start position:0%
uh i would like
 
01:03:54.870 --> 01:03:54.880 align:start position:0%
to add
 
01:03:58.230 --> 01:03:58.240 align:start position:0%
uh discussion and decisions around 106
 
01:04:01.589 --> 01:04:01.599 align:start position:0%
to what was the last one you said 110
 
01:04:03.990 --> 01:04:04.000 align:start position:0%
110 yes
 
01:04:06.470 --> 01:04:06.480 align:start position:0%
i would like to add those to
 
01:04:08.069 --> 01:04:08.079 align:start position:0%
our agenda for
 
01:04:08.079 --> 01:04:09.670 align:start position:0%
our agenda for
friday

01:04:09.670 --> 01:04:09.680 align:start position:0%
friday
 
01:04:09.680 --> 01:04:11.510 align:start position:0%
friday
and

01:04:11.510 --> 01:04:11.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:04:14.390 --> 01:04:14.400 align:start position:0%
and if we could if we could get an email
 
01:04:14.400 --> 01:04:15.270 align:start position:0%
and if we could if we could get an email
uh

01:04:15.270 --> 01:04:15.280 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:04:17.910 --> 01:04:17.920 align:start position:0%
to to uh the commandant
 
01:04:19.670 --> 01:04:19.680 align:start position:0%
to let her know that we want some more
 
01:04:22.069 --> 01:04:22.079 align:start position:0%
input on this and that we're thinking
 
01:04:22.079 --> 01:04:23.670 align:start position:0%
input on this and that we're thinking
about

01:04:23.670 --> 01:04:23.680 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:04:25.829 --> 01:04:25.839 align:start position:0%
removing redundancy in a couple of
 
01:04:28.309 --> 01:04:28.319 align:start position:0%
different ways removing
 
01:04:28.319 --> 01:04:29.589 align:start position:0%
different ways removing
one

01:04:29.589 --> 01:04:29.599 align:start position:0%
one
 
01:04:31.270 --> 01:04:31.280 align:start position:0%
section that's referring to another
 
01:04:33.910 --> 01:04:33.920 align:start position:0%
section of hb2 and then
 
01:04:36.309 --> 01:04:36.319 align:start position:0%
removing some hb2 language it's already
 
01:04:39.589 --> 01:04:39.599 align:start position:0%
in an organizational node so so i
 
01:04:41.510 --> 01:04:41.520 align:start position:0%
i think we could just clean up this area
 
01:04:45.150 --> 01:04:45.160 align:start position:0%
and maybe they wouldn't lose anything um
 
01:04:47.190 --> 01:04:47.200 align:start position:0%
10106 though is
 
01:04:49.190 --> 01:04:49.200 align:start position:0%
is a new concept is what i'm also
 
01:04:49.200 --> 01:04:50.710 align:start position:0%
is a new concept is what i'm also
hearing

01:04:50.710 --> 01:04:50.720 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
01:04:53.349 --> 01:04:53.359 align:start position:0%
so uh representative irf do you have a
 
01:04:53.359 --> 01:04:56.069 align:start position:0%
so uh representative irf do you have a
comment

01:04:56.069 --> 01:04:56.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:57.990 --> 01:04:58.000 align:start position:0%
just a quick question for kevin what
 
01:05:00.150 --> 01:05:00.160 align:start position:0%
page number is that in the pdf where the
 
01:05:01.750 --> 01:05:01.760 align:start position:0%
class note is is it
 
01:05:06.870 --> 01:05:06.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:09.349 --> 01:05:09.359 align:start position:0%
those are the two that i see
 
01:05:12.069 --> 01:05:12.079 align:start position:0%
class notes on
 
01:05:13.510 --> 01:05:13.520 align:start position:0%
those would be the two the only two
 
01:05:15.510 --> 01:05:15.520 align:start position:0%
class no i don't have the document up in
 
01:05:16.789 --> 01:05:16.799 align:start position:0%
front of me but those are the only two
 
01:05:18.150 --> 01:05:18.160 align:start position:0%
class notes that they have and i believe
 
01:05:20.309 --> 01:05:20.319 align:start position:0%
they read the same for both accounting
 
01:05:20.319 --> 01:05:21.190 align:start position:0%
they read the same for both accounting
units

01:05:21.190 --> 01:05:21.200 align:start position:0%
units
 
01:05:23.029 --> 01:05:23.039 align:start position:0%
okay and what does that one tied to back
 
01:05:26.870 --> 01:05:26.880 align:start position:0%
in hp2 which number and hp 2
 
01:05:28.950 --> 01:05:28.960 align:start position:0%
the section number yes
 
01:05:31.750 --> 01:05:31.760 align:start position:0%
uh sections
 
01:05:33.670 --> 01:05:33.680 align:start position:0%
section 108.
 
01:05:37.190 --> 01:05:37.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:38.950 --> 01:05:38.960 align:start position:0%
okay um
 
01:05:41.589 --> 01:05:41.599 align:start position:0%
representative weiler i'm gonna i'm
 
01:05:43.589 --> 01:05:43.599 align:start position:0%
gonna put you on the spot a little bit
 
01:05:46.150 --> 01:05:46.160 align:start position:0%
sir uh you can defer if you if you want
 
01:05:47.750 --> 01:05:47.760 align:start position:0%
uh more time but
 
01:05:51.029 --> 01:05:51.039 align:start position:0%
as you read section 106
 
01:05:55.270 --> 01:05:55.280 align:start position:0%
lines 21 through 24
 
01:05:58.870 --> 01:05:58.880 align:start position:0%
how how do you react to that sir
 
01:06:02.069 --> 01:06:02.079 align:start position:0%
similar to what we've done with hhs if
 
01:06:04.710 --> 01:06:04.720 align:start position:0%
you know it allows you some flexibility
 
01:06:06.230 --> 01:06:06.240 align:start position:0%
if you uh
 
01:06:08.069 --> 01:06:08.079 align:start position:0%
if you have someone leaving and you have
 
01:06:10.630 --> 01:06:10.640 align:start position:0%
positions you've got to fill then
 
01:06:12.360 --> 01:06:12.370 align:start position:0%
you would be able to do that
 
01:06:12.370 --> 01:06:13.910 align:start position:0%
you would be able to do that
[Music]

01:06:13.910 --> 01:06:13.920 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:06:15.190 --> 01:06:15.200 align:start position:0%
you know as long as you don't exceed
 
01:06:18.470 --> 01:06:18.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:21.190 --> 01:06:21.200 align:start position:0%
so i'm interpreting that to mean you you
 
01:06:22.230 --> 01:06:22.240 align:start position:0%
have no
 
01:06:22.240 --> 01:06:23.430 align:start position:0%
have no
um

01:06:23.430 --> 01:06:23.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:06:27.029 --> 01:06:27.039 align:start position:0%
no reason no problems i have no problem
 
01:06:27.039 --> 01:06:27.990 align:start position:0%
no reason no problems i have no problem
okay

01:06:27.990 --> 01:06:28.000 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:28.789 align:start position:0%
okay
um

01:06:28.789 --> 01:06:28.799 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:06:30.950 --> 01:06:30.960 align:start position:0%
so let's see if we can get it off the
 
01:06:35.750 --> 01:06:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:39.510 --> 01:06:39.520 align:start position:0%
there any 107 needs to be resolved with
 
01:06:43.589 --> 01:06:43.599 align:start position:0%
108 i believe you said mr ripple
 
01:06:46.069 --> 01:06:46.079 align:start position:0%
107 isn't in conflict with 108 but it
 
01:06:47.670 --> 01:06:47.680 align:start position:0%
includes some language that's also
 
01:06:50.789 --> 01:06:50.799 align:start position:0%
included in 109.
 
01:06:53.270 --> 01:06:53.280 align:start position:0%
consider that redundancy conflict just
 
01:06:53.280 --> 01:06:59.430 align:start position:0%
consider that redundancy conflict just
because

01:06:59.430 --> 01:06:59.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:03.029 --> 01:07:03.039 align:start position:0%
i i i think i think we should just defer
 
01:07:03.039 --> 01:07:03.990 align:start position:0%
i i i think i think we should just defer
all

01:07:03.990 --> 01:07:04.000 align:start position:0%
all
 
01:07:06.710 --> 01:07:06.720 align:start position:0%
five of these 106 to 110
 
01:07:10.390 --> 01:07:10.400 align:start position:0%
uh for consideration on friday and
 
01:07:13.270 --> 01:07:13.280 align:start position:0%
um i i don't think anyone has a problem
 
01:07:16.390 --> 01:07:16.400 align:start position:0%
with 106 but but in terms of uh
 
01:07:18.549 --> 01:07:18.559 align:start position:0%
redundancy i think we
 
01:07:18.559 --> 01:07:19.670 align:start position:0%
redundancy i think we
just

01:07:19.670 --> 01:07:19.680 align:start position:0%
just
 
01:07:21.270 --> 01:07:21.280 align:start position:0%
for the good of the state may want to
 
01:07:22.549 --> 01:07:22.559 align:start position:0%
clean that up
 
01:07:22.559 --> 01:07:22.870 align:start position:0%
clean that up
um

01:07:22.870 --> 01:07:22.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:07:22.880 --> 01:07:24.069 align:start position:0%
um
[Music]

01:07:24.069 --> 01:07:24.079 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:07:25.910 --> 01:07:25.920 align:start position:0%
all right
 
01:07:28.230 --> 01:07:28.240 align:start position:0%
does anyone disagree with that approach
 
01:07:28.240 --> 01:07:29.910 align:start position:0%
does anyone disagree with that approach
nope

01:07:29.910 --> 01:07:29.920 align:start position:0%
nope
 
01:07:32.390 --> 01:07:32.400 align:start position:0%
all right no disagreement
 
01:07:36.230 --> 01:07:36.240 align:start position:0%
okay so uh mr ripple
 
01:07:38.710 --> 01:07:38.720 align:start position:0%
are are you ready to to
 
01:07:40.309 --> 01:07:40.319 align:start position:0%
to give us another
 
01:07:43.430 --> 01:07:43.440 align:start position:0%
uh bite at the apple a tutorial on
 
01:07:48.390 --> 01:07:48.400 align:start position:0%
the uses of lapses in our final prod
 
01:07:50.470 --> 01:07:50.480 align:start position:0%
product that that's good that's due on
 
01:07:54.549 --> 01:07:54.559 align:start position:0%
the 24th the uses of lapses uh and kind
 
01:07:56.950 --> 01:07:56.960 align:start position:0%
of the history of how lapses get used as
 
01:07:59.589 --> 01:07:59.599 align:start position:0%
part of the budgeting process
 
01:08:02.390 --> 01:08:02.400 align:start position:0%
sure i can give you a brief history um i
 
01:08:04.150 --> 01:08:04.160 align:start position:0%
think as far as what division three has
 
01:08:06.710 --> 01:08:06.720 align:start position:0%
to produce by the 24th
 
01:08:08.710 --> 01:08:08.720 align:start position:0%
you don't necessarily have to be
 
01:08:10.470 --> 01:08:10.480 align:start position:0%
concerned with the lapse because we
 
01:08:12.390 --> 01:08:12.400 align:start position:0%
won't identify a department's specific
 
01:08:13.589 --> 01:08:13.599 align:start position:0%
lapse number
 
01:08:15.990 --> 01:08:16.000 align:start position:0%
we'll only identify a statewide lapse
 
01:08:18.229 --> 01:08:18.239 align:start position:0%
number on our surplus statement
 
01:08:20.550 --> 01:08:20.560 align:start position:0%
and i can go down and find that
 
01:08:22.870 --> 01:08:22.880 align:start position:0%
in our surplus statement for the current
 
01:08:26.070 --> 01:08:26.080 align:start position:0%
in just a moment but as far as
 
01:08:28.149 --> 01:08:28.159 align:start position:0%
the lapse is concerned
 
01:08:30.149 --> 01:08:30.159 align:start position:0%
budgeting for relapse really goes back
 
01:08:30.159 --> 01:08:30.870 align:start position:0%
budgeting for relapse really goes back
to

01:08:30.870 --> 01:08:30.880 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:08:32.950 --> 01:08:32.960 align:start position:0%
1980s i think prior to that the state
 
01:08:34.550 --> 01:08:34.560 align:start position:0%
didn't do it
 
01:08:36.550 --> 01:08:36.560 align:start position:0%
and i think to provide some historical
 
01:08:37.990 --> 01:08:38.000 align:start position:0%
perspective frankly the way it came
 
01:08:39.430 --> 01:08:39.440 align:start position:0%
about was
 
01:08:41.590 --> 01:08:41.600 align:start position:0%
the legislature needed to find a way to
 
01:08:44.470 --> 01:08:44.480 align:start position:0%
balance its budget
 
01:08:46.550 --> 01:08:46.560 align:start position:0%
in one of those sessions in the 80s and
 
01:08:48.070 --> 01:08:48.080 align:start position:0%
somebody came up with the idea to say
 
01:08:49.189 --> 01:08:49.199 align:start position:0%
well hey
 
01:08:51.030 --> 01:08:51.040 align:start position:0%
state agencies don't spend every dime of
 
01:08:52.709 --> 01:08:52.719 align:start position:0%
their appropriation
 
01:08:55.590 --> 01:08:55.600 align:start position:0%
let's assume that agencies will last 10
 
01:08:57.189 --> 01:08:57.199 align:start position:0%
million 20 million whatever of the
 
01:08:58.789 --> 01:08:58.799 align:start position:0%
amount they've given them
 
01:09:02.070 --> 01:09:02.080 align:start position:0%
and that allows us to balance the budget
 
01:09:03.430 --> 01:09:03.440 align:start position:0%
and so
 
01:09:05.669 --> 01:09:05.679 align:start position:0%
for that reason every budget since has
 
01:09:08.149 --> 01:09:08.159 align:start position:0%
included a statewide general fund lapse
 
01:09:08.159 --> 01:09:13.510 align:start position:0%
included a statewide general fund lapse
figure

01:09:13.510 --> 01:09:13.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:15.669 --> 01:09:15.679 align:start position:0%
the percentage of that that lapse amount
 
01:09:18.070 --> 01:09:18.080 align:start position:0%
varies it's been between two percent
 
01:09:19.430 --> 01:09:19.440 align:start position:0%
four percent of general fund
 
01:09:19.440 --> 01:09:21.189 align:start position:0%
four percent of general fund
expenditures

01:09:21.189 --> 01:09:21.199 align:start position:0%
expenditures
 
01:09:22.550 --> 01:09:22.560 align:start position:0%
and it can be raised and lowered
 
01:09:24.550 --> 01:09:24.560 align:start position:0%
throughout the process
 
01:09:27.189 --> 01:09:27.199 align:start position:0%
as i said it is a statewide figure
 
01:09:29.829 --> 01:09:29.839 align:start position:0%
so you don't assume an hhs specific
 
01:09:32.470 --> 01:09:32.480 align:start position:0%
lapse but generally speaking
 
01:09:33.990 --> 01:09:34.000 align:start position:0%
the governor's office will assign a
 
01:09:36.709 --> 01:09:36.719 align:start position:0%
lapse target to each agency and expect
 
01:09:39.349 --> 01:09:39.359 align:start position:0%
each agencies to manage to that figure
 
01:09:43.510 --> 01:09:43.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:43.520 --> 01:09:44.789 align:start position:0%
 
and

01:09:44.789 --> 01:09:44.799 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:09:47.030 --> 01:09:47.040 align:start position:0%
really the only other thing i would add
 
01:09:48.630 --> 01:09:48.640 align:start position:0%
is that
 
01:09:50.229 --> 01:09:50.239 align:start position:0%
the lapse requirement though contained
 
01:09:51.990 --> 01:09:52.000 align:start position:0%
on our surplus statement is not
 
01:09:53.590 --> 01:09:53.600 align:start position:0%
contained anywhere in state law so
 
01:09:55.910 --> 01:09:55.920 align:start position:0%
there's an expectations expectation that
 
01:09:58.870 --> 01:09:58.880 align:start position:0%
late agencies will manage to the lapse
 
01:10:01.270 --> 01:10:01.280 align:start position:0%
but there's no legal aspect there's no
 
01:10:04.390 --> 01:10:04.400 align:start position:0%
legal requirement that they do so so hhs
 
01:10:06.229 --> 01:10:06.239 align:start position:0%
for example could theoretically spend
 
01:10:08.310 --> 01:10:08.320 align:start position:0%
every dime of its appropriation but in
 
01:10:11.510 --> 01:10:11.520 align:start position:0%
practice that just doesn't happen
 
01:10:13.910 --> 01:10:13.920 align:start position:0%
so let me pull up our surplus statement
 
01:10:15.590 --> 01:10:15.600 align:start position:0%
here just to give you an idea of what
 
01:10:18.070 --> 01:10:18.080 align:start position:0%
i'm talking about
 
01:10:37.510 --> 01:10:37.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:40.630 --> 01:10:40.640 align:start position:0%
okay so i'm about to share
 
01:10:44.709 --> 01:10:44.719 align:start position:0%
our surplus statement for the 2021
 
01:10:44.719 --> 01:10:50.630 align:start position:0%
our surplus statement for the 2021
biennium

01:10:50.630 --> 01:10:50.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:53.430 --> 01:10:53.440 align:start position:0%
and you'll see here on lines
 
01:10:55.510 --> 01:10:55.520 align:start position:0%
9 and 10 budget appropriations and
 
01:10:57.669 --> 01:10:57.679 align:start position:0%
appropriation adjustments so that line
 
01:10:59.430 --> 01:10:59.440 align:start position:0%
nine budget appropriations is everything
 
01:11:01.669 --> 01:11:01.679 align:start position:0%
you would find in house bill one
 
01:11:03.430 --> 01:11:03.440 align:start position:0%
line ten appropriation adjustments is
 
01:11:04.870 --> 01:11:04.880 align:start position:0%
any spending that you would find either
 
01:11:06.790 --> 01:11:06.800 align:start position:0%
in the trailer bill or any other bills
 
01:11:08.390 --> 01:11:08.400 align:start position:0%
that the legislature has passed for that
 
01:11:11.030 --> 01:11:11.040 align:start position:0%
year and then on line 11 you'll see less
 
01:11:13.430 --> 01:11:13.440 align:start position:0%
general fund lapse estimate so for
 
01:11:16.070 --> 01:11:16.080 align:start position:0%
fiscal 20 for example we assume that the
 
01:11:19.750 --> 01:11:19.760 align:start position:0%
general fund lapse would be 56.7 million
 
01:11:22.470 --> 01:11:22.480 align:start position:0%
and then in 21 that it would be 75.4
 
01:11:24.950 --> 01:11:24.960 align:start position:0%
million uh in reality the actual figure
 
01:11:26.950 --> 01:11:26.960 align:start position:0%
is going to be much higher than that i
 
01:11:28.709 --> 01:11:28.719 align:start position:0%
think the the governor's surplus
 
01:11:31.270 --> 01:11:31.280 align:start position:0%
statement assumes a lapse of 150.5
 
01:11:34.790 --> 01:11:34.800 align:start position:0%
million dollars in fiscal 21.
 
01:11:36.310 --> 01:11:36.320 align:start position:0%
but down here on line 12 total
 
01:11:37.910 --> 01:11:37.920 align:start position:0%
appropriations you'll see that's simply
 
01:11:39.189 --> 01:11:39.199 align:start position:0%
the net of everything that's been
 
01:11:40.870 --> 01:11:40.880 align:start position:0%
appropriated either in the operating
 
01:11:42.630 --> 01:11:42.640 align:start position:0%
budget or other bills
 
01:11:45.189 --> 01:11:45.199 align:start position:0%
minus that statewide lapse estimate for
 
01:11:46.790 --> 01:11:46.800 align:start position:0%
the year and that's how we arrive at net
 
01:11:46.800 --> 01:11:48.630 align:start position:0%
the year and that's how we arrive at net
appropriations

01:11:48.630 --> 01:11:48.640 align:start position:0%
appropriations
 
01:11:49.990 --> 01:11:50.000 align:start position:0%
so i think that's a really quick
 
01:11:51.510 --> 01:11:51.520 align:start position:0%
overview i don't know if you have any
 
01:11:53.750 --> 01:11:53.760 align:start position:0%
questions about that
 
01:11:58.070 --> 01:11:58.080 align:start position:0%
well that helps me a great deal and um
 
01:12:00.229 --> 01:12:00.239 align:start position:0%
and what was really valuable was that i
 
01:12:04.310 --> 01:12:04.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:05.750 --> 01:12:05.760 align:start position:0%
that's true division three does not have
 
01:12:08.790 --> 01:12:08.800 align:start position:0%
to assume any less so thank you for for
 
01:12:10.709 --> 01:12:10.719 align:start position:0%
not bearing the lead in houston that is
 
01:12:12.229 --> 01:12:12.239 align:start position:0%
one of your thesis statements i
 
01:12:13.990 --> 01:12:14.000 align:start position:0%
appreciate it
 
01:12:16.630 --> 01:12:16.640 align:start position:0%
so uh representative irf
 
01:12:21.030 --> 01:12:21.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:22.630 --> 01:12:22.640 align:start position:0%
okay i'm good
 
01:12:22.640 --> 01:12:24.390 align:start position:0%
okay i'm good
okay

01:12:24.390 --> 01:12:24.400 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:12:27.110 --> 01:12:27.120 align:start position:0%
do any of our uh other committee members
 
01:12:29.830 --> 01:12:29.840 align:start position:0%
want to uh just comment in general about
 
01:12:32.470 --> 01:12:32.480 align:start position:0%
what mr ripple just said
 
01:12:34.470 --> 01:12:34.480 align:start position:0%
some of you have seen this a couple of
 
01:12:34.480 --> 01:12:37.030 align:start position:0%
some of you have seen this a couple of
times

01:12:37.030 --> 01:12:37.040 align:start position:0%
times
 
01:12:39.270 --> 01:12:39.280 align:start position:0%
no i'm not really seeing any
 
01:12:39.280 --> 01:12:40.709 align:start position:0%
no i'm not really seeing any
um

01:12:40.709 --> 01:12:40.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:12:42.390 --> 01:12:42.400 align:start position:0%
well thank you
 
01:12:42.400 --> 01:12:43.430 align:start position:0%
well thank you
welcome

01:12:43.430 --> 01:12:43.440 align:start position:0%
welcome
 
01:12:47.990 --> 01:12:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:50.870 --> 01:12:50.880 align:start position:0%
have you share the
 
01:12:53.750 --> 01:12:53.760 align:start position:0%
portion of the governor's budget
 
01:12:55.590 --> 01:12:55.600 align:start position:0%
related to
 
01:12:55.600 --> 01:12:58.950 align:start position:0%
related to
medicaid

01:12:58.950 --> 01:12:58.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:58.960 --> 01:13:05.910 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:13:05.910 --> 01:13:05.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:08.790 --> 01:13:08.800 align:start position:0%
and then representative irf
 
01:13:12.070 --> 01:13:12.080 align:start position:0%
in in background will you take a look at
 
01:13:12.080 --> 01:13:13.350 align:start position:0%
in in background will you take a look at
um

01:13:13.350 --> 01:13:13.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:13:15.750 --> 01:13:15.760 align:start position:0%
the working document you put together so
 
01:13:16.870 --> 01:13:16.880 align:start position:0%
that we can
 
01:13:22.550 --> 01:13:22.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:23.990 --> 01:13:24.000 align:start position:0%
yes sir
 
01:13:25.270 --> 01:13:25.280 align:start position:0%
all right
 
01:13:27.350 --> 01:13:27.360 align:start position:0%
now there are medicaid funds throughout
 
01:13:29.350 --> 01:13:29.360 align:start position:0%
the hhs budget i wasn't sure what
 
01:13:31.189 --> 01:13:31.199 align:start position:0%
account specifically you wanted to look
 
01:13:33.189 --> 01:13:33.199 align:start position:0%
at so i just pulled up the biggest one
 
01:13:40.950 --> 01:13:40.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:43.830 --> 01:13:43.840 align:start position:0%
this is and this is the money i just i'm
 
01:13:47.270 --> 01:13:47.280 align:start position:0%
just verifying this is the money that
 
01:13:50.229 --> 01:13:50.239 align:start position:0%
that we match with the feds
 
01:13:52.070 --> 01:13:52.080 align:start position:0%
and this is what
 
01:13:53.830 --> 01:13:53.840 align:start position:0%
funds our
 
01:13:55.590 --> 01:13:55.600 align:start position:0%
contracts with the managed care
 
01:13:57.990 --> 01:13:58.000 align:start position:0%
organizations to provide actual hands-on
 
01:14:01.510 --> 01:14:01.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:04.390 --> 01:14:04.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:04.400 --> 01:14:05.350 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:14:05.350 --> 01:14:05.360 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:14:05.360 --> 01:14:08.070 align:start position:0%
so
um

01:14:08.070 --> 01:14:08.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:10.630 --> 01:14:10.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:13.110 --> 01:14:13.120 align:start position:0%
working assumption is that
 
01:14:15.990 --> 01:14:16.000 align:start position:0%
uh we need to fully fund the general
 
01:14:20.149 --> 01:14:20.159 align:start position:0%
fund's obligations to to fully receive
 
01:14:22.390 --> 01:14:22.400 align:start position:0%
the federal funds
 
01:14:25.350 --> 01:14:25.360 align:start position:0%
that that's that's my working theory
 
01:14:25.360 --> 01:14:26.229 align:start position:0%
that that's that's my working theory
um

01:14:26.229 --> 01:14:26.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:14:26.239 --> 01:14:26.950 align:start position:0%
um
so

01:14:26.950 --> 01:14:26.960 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:14:26.960 --> 01:14:29.430 align:start position:0%
so
what

01:14:29.430 --> 01:14:29.440 align:start position:0%
what
 
01:14:32.390 --> 01:14:32.400 align:start position:0%
what what number are we looking at here
 
01:14:35.189 --> 01:14:35.199 align:start position:0%
uh for the total general funds to fund
 
01:14:39.350 --> 01:14:39.360 align:start position:0%
this is it the 75 no it's the 397 number
 
01:14:40.790 --> 01:14:40.800 align:start position:0%
no it's the
 
01:14:44.790 --> 01:14:44.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:44.800 --> 01:14:46.310 align:start position:0%
 
now

01:14:46.310 --> 01:14:46.320 align:start position:0%
now
 
01:14:46.320 --> 01:14:47.990 align:start position:0%
now
representative

01:14:47.990 --> 01:14:48.000 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:14:49.270 --> 01:14:49.280 align:start position:0%
in in your
 
01:14:51.510 --> 01:14:51.520 align:start position:0%
okay representative waller you have a
 
01:14:51.520 --> 01:14:52.390 align:start position:0%
okay representative waller you have a
question

01:14:52.390 --> 01:14:52.400 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:14:54.310 --> 01:14:54.320 align:start position:0%
kevin i'm just wondering
 
01:14:58.070 --> 01:14:58.080 align:start position:0%
what page is it in what page is it on
 
01:15:00.229 --> 01:15:00.239 align:start position:0%
well you know what i'm saying
 
01:15:01.990 --> 01:15:02.000 align:start position:0%
i see now that i'm looking up house bill
 
01:15:03.350 --> 01:15:03.360 align:start position:0%
one rather than the governor's
 
01:15:05.030 --> 01:15:05.040 align:start position:0%
recommended so let me just go back and
 
01:15:07.430 --> 01:15:07.440 align:start position:0%
pull up the
 
01:15:08.790 --> 01:15:08.800 align:start position:0%
it's the same accounting unit and the
 
01:15:10.310 --> 01:15:10.320 align:start position:0%
same numbers of course but you aren't
 
01:15:14.229 --> 01:15:14.239 align:start position:0%
able to see the comparison with 2021 so
 
01:15:16.470 --> 01:15:16.480 align:start position:0%
right pull that up
 
01:15:27.030 --> 01:15:27.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:30.950 --> 01:15:30.960 align:start position:0%
account 7948 on page
 
01:15:49.510 --> 01:15:49.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:49.520 --> 01:15:53.990 align:start position:0%
 
there

01:15:53.990 --> 01:15:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:55.590 --> 01:15:55.600 align:start position:0%
i'll just highlight the general fun
 
01:15:57.590 --> 01:15:57.600 align:start position:0%
totals for everybody to see
 
01:16:01.669 --> 01:16:01.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:06.390 --> 01:16:06.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:09.189 --> 01:16:09.199 align:start position:0%
feels to me to be about
 
01:16:09.199 --> 01:16:10.229 align:start position:0%
feels to me to be about
um

01:16:10.229 --> 01:16:10.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:16:17.830 --> 01:16:17.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:21.590 --> 01:16:21.600 align:start position:0%
do we know why the governor recommended
 
01:16:23.830 --> 01:16:23.840 align:start position:0%
that exact number because it's all all
 
01:16:26.070 --> 01:16:26.080 align:start position:0%
the way down to the last dollar it's
 
01:16:26.080 --> 01:16:27.590 align:start position:0%
the way down to the last dollar it's
exactly

01:16:27.590 --> 01:16:27.600 align:start position:0%
exactly
 
01:16:28.510 --> 01:16:28.520 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:16:31.669 --> 01:16:31.679 align:start position:0%
189 million 220
 
01:16:31.679 --> 01:16:33.590 align:start position:0%
189 million 220
908

01:16:33.590 --> 01:16:33.600 align:start position:0%
908
 
01:16:35.590 --> 01:16:35.600 align:start position:0%
or 909
 
01:16:35.600 --> 01:16:36.310 align:start position:0%
or 909
so

01:16:36.310 --> 01:16:36.320 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:16:39.510 --> 01:16:39.520 align:start position:0%
so that's a very precise number and that
 
01:16:39.520 --> 01:16:41.110 align:start position:0%
so that's a very precise number and that
implies

01:16:41.110 --> 01:16:41.120 align:start position:0%
implies
 
01:16:44.630 --> 01:16:44.640 align:start position:0%
some very precise assumptions and so
 
01:16:44.640 --> 01:16:45.910 align:start position:0%
some very precise assumptions and so
uh

01:16:45.910 --> 01:16:45.920 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:16:47.030 --> 01:16:47.040 align:start position:0%
is is
 
01:16:48.550 --> 01:16:48.560 align:start position:0%
ms rounds on
 
01:16:50.390 --> 01:16:50.400 align:start position:0%
do you want to do you want to tell us
 
01:16:54.070 --> 01:16:54.080 align:start position:0%
about what you can about that 189 number
 
01:16:57.189 --> 01:16:57.199 align:start position:0%
or in the government on youtube
 
01:16:57.199 --> 01:16:57.990 align:start position:0%
or in the government on youtube
so

01:16:57.990 --> 01:16:58.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:17:01.270 --> 01:17:01.280 align:start position:0%
as far as the preciseness of it i i um
 
01:17:03.350 --> 01:17:03.360 align:start position:0%
i would just speak briefly the athena
 
01:17:06.229 --> 01:17:06.239 align:start position:0%
gagnon is the medicaid finance director
 
01:17:08.070 --> 01:17:08.080 align:start position:0%
who works for me and works directly with
 
01:17:11.030 --> 01:17:11.040 align:start position:0%
medicaid uh she has been doing medicaid
 
01:17:12.870 --> 01:17:12.880 align:start position:0%
finance for
 
01:17:15.590 --> 01:17:15.600 align:start position:0%
oh i don't know 20-ish years i would
 
01:17:18.390 --> 01:17:18.400 align:start position:0%
guess at least kevin knows her well um
 
01:17:18.400 --> 01:17:19.750 align:start position:0%
guess at least kevin knows her well um
she

01:17:19.750 --> 01:17:19.760 align:start position:0%
she
 
01:17:21.510 --> 01:17:21.520 align:start position:0%
so she is very precise with her
 
01:17:24.550 --> 01:17:24.560 align:start position:0%
budgeting so in addition to funding
 
01:17:26.709 --> 01:17:26.719 align:start position:0%
the um
 
01:17:28.950 --> 01:17:28.960 align:start position:0%
the managed care organization contracts
 
01:17:31.430 --> 01:17:31.440 align:start position:0%
in this budget it also is the fee for
 
01:17:31.440 --> 01:17:32.470 align:start position:0%
in this budget it also is the fee for
service

01:17:32.470 --> 01:17:32.480 align:start position:0%
service
 
01:17:35.270 --> 01:17:35.280 align:start position:0%
um as well as some other uh smaller
 
01:17:35.280 --> 01:17:36.950 align:start position:0%
um as well as some other uh smaller
expenditures

01:17:36.950 --> 01:17:36.960 align:start position:0%
expenditures
 
01:17:39.110 --> 01:17:39.120 align:start position:0%
so what i would do to explain the
 
01:17:43.189 --> 01:17:43.199 align:start position:0%
changes here is to start at line 101
 
01:17:44.470 --> 01:17:44.480 align:start position:0%
and what you're seeing
 
01:17:46.870 --> 01:17:46.880 align:start position:0%
is a decrease
 
01:17:46.880 --> 01:17:48.229 align:start position:0%
is a decrease
from

01:17:48.229 --> 01:17:48.239 align:start position:0%
from
 
01:17:50.070 --> 01:17:50.080 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 22
 
01:17:50.080 --> 01:17:50.870 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 22
to

01:17:50.870 --> 01:17:50.880 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:17:54.390 --> 01:17:54.400 align:start position:0%
from fiscal year 21 of 731 million
 
01:17:57.669 --> 01:17:57.679 align:start position:0%
to 706 million and the largest change
 
01:17:59.990 --> 01:18:00.000 align:start position:0%
here is the establishment of the chip
 
01:18:03.270 --> 01:18:03.280 align:start position:0%
account um and balancing what is in this
 
01:18:04.790 --> 01:18:04.800 align:start position:0%
accounting unit versus what is in the
 
01:18:08.630 --> 01:18:08.640 align:start position:0%
chip accounting unit uh in 1819
 
01:18:10.950 --> 01:18:10.960 align:start position:0%
chip was within this accounting unit was
 
01:18:14.790 --> 01:18:14.800 align:start position:0%
within 79.48 in 2021 we created the chip
 
01:18:18.390 --> 01:18:18.400 align:start position:0%
account and so in 2223 we're trying to
 
01:18:19.990 --> 01:18:20.000 align:start position:0%
balance what should be here and what
 
01:18:21.270 --> 01:18:21.280 align:start position:0%
should be in the flip account we
 
01:18:23.110 --> 01:18:23.120 align:start position:0%
actually have a fiscal item
 
01:18:24.550 --> 01:18:24.560 align:start position:0%
that you'll see not on this week's
 
01:18:26.470 --> 01:18:26.480 align:start position:0%
fiscal committee agenda but the next
 
01:18:28.870 --> 01:18:28.880 align:start position:0%
fiscal committee agenda moving funds
 
01:18:32.070 --> 01:18:32.080 align:start position:0%
from 7948 to the chip account
 
01:18:35.270 --> 01:18:35.280 align:start position:0%
so that is uh the change in 101.
 
01:18:38.390 --> 01:18:38.400 align:start position:0%
lines 535 and 563
 
01:18:40.870 --> 01:18:40.880 align:start position:0%
are um
 
01:18:43.590 --> 01:18:43.600 align:start position:0%
are transferred from the dcyf budget
 
01:18:46.310 --> 01:18:46.320 align:start position:0%
they were previously in 2958.
 
01:18:48.070 --> 01:18:48.080 align:start position:0%
if you remember during the presentations
 
01:18:50.390 --> 01:18:50.400 align:start position:0%
both in dcyf and in medicaid we talked
 
01:18:52.790 --> 01:18:52.800 align:start position:0%
about um how we're trying to put all of
 
01:18:54.470 --> 01:18:54.480 align:start position:0%
the medicaid expenditures into the
 
01:18:57.110 --> 01:18:57.120 align:start position:0%
medicaid budget for contracted medicaid
 
01:18:57.120 --> 01:18:58.390 align:start position:0%
medicaid budget for contracted medicaid
expenditures

01:18:58.390 --> 01:18:58.400 align:start position:0%
expenditures
 
01:19:01.030 --> 01:19:01.040 align:start position:0%
or fee for service and so that
 
01:19:03.750 --> 01:19:03.760 align:start position:0%
represents that change
 
01:19:05.910 --> 01:19:05.920 align:start position:0%
and then when we go down to the overall
 
01:19:08.470 --> 01:19:08.480 align:start position:0%
source of funds here
 
01:19:10.310 --> 01:19:10.320 align:start position:0%
so there's a lot of moving parts when it
 
01:19:12.149 --> 01:19:12.159 align:start position:0%
comes to the source of funds
 
01:19:17.750 --> 01:19:17.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:20.310 --> 01:19:20.320 align:start position:0%
the agency income i'm sorry the private
 
01:19:22.790 --> 01:19:22.800 align:start position:0%
local funds on zero zero five are
 
01:19:25.830 --> 01:19:25.840 align:start position:0%
related to the medicaid enhancement tax
 
01:19:29.350 --> 01:19:29.360 align:start position:0%
so that can vary based on that um
 
01:19:29.360 --> 01:19:30.550 align:start position:0%
so that can vary based on that um
the

01:19:30.550 --> 01:19:30.560 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:19:33.510 --> 01:19:33.520 align:start position:0%
general federal mix here in fiscal year
 
01:19:37.270 --> 01:19:37.280 align:start position:0%
22 is different than 23 not only because
 
01:19:39.430 --> 01:19:39.440 align:start position:0%
of the um
 
01:19:41.110 --> 01:19:41.120 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry the mets is staying the same
 
01:19:42.630 --> 01:19:42.640 align:start position:0%
there the difference there is the
 
01:19:44.310 --> 01:19:44.320 align:start position:0%
federal funds and the reason for that is
 
01:19:46.709 --> 01:19:46.719 align:start position:0%
during the governor's budget we adjusted
 
01:19:48.390 --> 01:19:48.400 align:start position:0%
the federal funds
 
01:19:51.910 --> 01:19:51.920 align:start position:0%
because it has been told to governors by
 
01:19:53.350 --> 01:19:53.360 align:start position:0%
the federal government that the public
 
01:19:55.510 --> 01:19:55.520 align:start position:0%
health emergency is likely to continue
 
01:19:57.510 --> 01:19:57.520 align:start position:0%
through december so we made an
 
01:19:59.110 --> 01:19:59.120 align:start position:0%
adjustment to the federal funds in
 
01:20:01.750 --> 01:20:01.760 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 22
 
01:20:05.110 --> 01:20:05.120 align:start position:0%
to reflect an additional urn of federal
 
01:20:07.110 --> 01:20:07.120 align:start position:0%
uh due to that enhanced
 
01:20:07.120 --> 01:20:09.590 align:start position:0%
uh due to that enhanced
fmap

01:20:09.590 --> 01:20:09.600 align:start position:0%
fmap
 
01:20:10.950 --> 01:20:10.960 align:start position:0%
that was a lot of words so i'm going to
 
01:20:10.960 --> 01:20:11.830 align:start position:0%
that was a lot of words so i'm going to
stop

01:20:11.830 --> 01:20:11.840 align:start position:0%
stop
 
01:20:13.830 --> 01:20:13.840 align:start position:0%
and see if there is
 
01:20:16.070 --> 01:20:16.080 align:start position:0%
there's a lot a lot there so
 
01:20:17.830 --> 01:20:17.840 align:start position:0%
representative waller you had your hand
 
01:20:19.350 --> 01:20:19.360 align:start position:0%
up and you've taken it down was your
 
01:20:23.430 --> 01:20:23.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:26.470 --> 01:20:26.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:29.910 --> 01:20:29.920 align:start position:0%
okay yes i'm fine
 
01:20:33.350 --> 01:20:33.360 align:start position:0%
representative uh weiler
 
01:20:35.510 --> 01:20:35.520 align:start position:0%
i noticed the difference
 
01:20:37.830 --> 01:20:37.840 align:start position:0%
in federal funds general funds were
 
01:20:39.990 --> 01:20:40.000 align:start position:0%
from 22 to 23.
 
01:20:42.550 --> 01:20:42.560 align:start position:0%
the general funds went up but the
 
01:20:44.629 --> 01:20:44.639 align:start position:0%
federal funds went down and then i heard
 
01:20:47.189 --> 01:20:47.199 align:start position:0%
a talk about advanced f map that might
 
01:20:49.669 --> 01:20:49.679 align:start position:0%
be the explanation for why the
 
01:20:51.590 --> 01:20:51.600 align:start position:0%
we seem to be going up while they go
 
01:20:53.590 --> 01:20:53.600 align:start position:0%
down so that that i guess that answered
 
01:20:55.430 --> 01:20:55.440 align:start position:0%
that question is that correct correct mr
 
01:21:00.550 --> 01:21:00.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:03.030 --> 01:21:03.040 align:start position:0%
do you think um your explanation would
 
01:21:05.350 --> 01:21:05.360 align:start position:0%
be significantly enhanced if we got ms
 
01:21:08.149 --> 01:21:08.159 align:start position:0%
gagnon in here uh this afternoon
 
01:21:10.310 --> 01:21:10.320 align:start position:0%
so the only i would say the the piece
 
01:21:13.030 --> 01:21:13.040 align:start position:0%
that uh that athena could provide that i
 
01:21:16.070 --> 01:21:16.080 align:start position:0%
don't know as well is all of the um
 
01:21:18.870 --> 01:21:18.880 align:start position:0%
expenditures that make up 101 she could
 
01:21:21.350 --> 01:21:21.360 align:start position:0%
tell you why that number is so precise
 
01:21:23.669 --> 01:21:23.679 align:start position:0%
um that would be what she could probably
 
01:21:25.910 --> 01:21:25.920 align:start position:0%
add for you
 
01:21:27.910 --> 01:21:27.920 align:start position:0%
representative or you you have a
 
01:21:27.920 --> 01:21:28.870 align:start position:0%
representative or you you have a
question

01:21:28.870 --> 01:21:28.880 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:21:30.310 --> 01:21:30.320 align:start position:0%
i do
 
01:21:32.709 --> 01:21:32.719 align:start position:0%
can you explain why the
 
01:21:35.910 --> 01:21:35.920 align:start position:0%
uh double o5 private local funds the met
 
01:21:38.310 --> 01:21:38.320 align:start position:0%
why why is that budget much lower than
 
01:21:40.229 --> 01:21:40.239 align:start position:0%
what much lower than actual and 20 and
 
01:21:41.910 --> 01:21:41.920 align:start position:0%
somewhat lower than than this year's
 
01:21:43.910 --> 01:21:43.920 align:start position:0%
adjusted authorized
 
01:21:47.270 --> 01:21:47.280 align:start position:0%
uh that is because it the uh medicaid
 
01:21:49.590 --> 01:21:49.600 align:start position:0%
enhancement tax is based on the previous
 
01:21:53.590 --> 01:21:53.600 align:start position:0%
year and so fiscal year uh 22 would be
 
01:21:58.550 --> 01:21:58.560 align:start position:0%
based on calendar year 21 um and the
 
01:22:00.629 --> 01:22:00.639 align:start position:0%
hospitals are anticipated to have less
 
01:22:03.350 --> 01:22:03.360 align:start position:0%
revenue in fiscal year 21 than what was
 
01:22:06.070 --> 01:22:06.080 align:start position:0%
i mean yeah in calendar year 21 than
 
01:22:08.950 --> 01:22:08.960 align:start position:0%
what was previously budgeted for fiscal
 
01:22:12.950 --> 01:22:12.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:14.790 --> 01:22:14.800 align:start position:0%
because the medicaid enhancement tax is
 
01:22:18.709 --> 01:22:18.719 align:start position:0%
based on net patient service revenue
 
01:22:20.229 --> 01:22:20.239 align:start position:0%
oh i don't have all right not not
 
01:22:21.910 --> 01:22:21.920 align:start position:0%
relevant okay have a follow-up
 
01:22:21.920 --> 01:22:23.590 align:start position:0%
relevant okay have a follow-up
representative

01:22:23.590 --> 01:22:23.600 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:22:23.600 --> 01:22:25.830 align:start position:0%
representative
no

01:22:25.830 --> 01:22:25.840 align:start position:0%
no
 
01:22:27.990 --> 01:22:28.000 align:start position:0%
you're not moving oh there you go sorry
 
01:22:31.350 --> 01:22:31.360 align:start position:0%
no i thought you could hear me not bad
 
01:22:31.360 --> 01:22:32.229 align:start position:0%
no i thought you could hear me not bad
so

01:22:32.229 --> 01:22:32.239 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:22:33.990 --> 01:22:34.000 align:start position:0%
uh i have a question for you
 
01:22:36.229 --> 01:22:36.239 align:start position:0%
representative verv
 
01:22:37.270 --> 01:22:37.280 align:start position:0%
yes sir
 
01:22:38.870 --> 01:22:38.880 align:start position:0%
in the
 
01:22:38.880 --> 01:22:40.070 align:start position:0%
in the
worksheet

01:22:40.070 --> 01:22:40.080 align:start position:0%
worksheet
 
01:22:42.470 --> 01:22:42.480 align:start position:0%
that you've worked so hard on
 
01:22:42.480 --> 01:22:43.350 align:start position:0%
that you've worked so hard on
um

01:22:43.350 --> 01:22:43.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:22:46.310 --> 01:22:46.320 align:start position:0%
for the general funds
 
01:22:49.270 --> 01:22:49.280 align:start position:0%
under 79.48
 
01:22:53.030 --> 01:22:53.040 align:start position:0%
the governor's recommended is 189
 
01:22:53.040 --> 01:22:55.830 align:start position:0%
the governor's recommended is 189
229.

01:22:55.830 --> 01:22:55.840 align:start position:0%
229.
 
01:22:58.149 --> 01:22:58.159 align:start position:0%
what number are you carrying in your
 
01:22:58.159 --> 01:22:59.430 align:start position:0%
what number are you carrying in your
worksheet

01:22:59.430 --> 01:22:59.440 align:start position:0%
worksheet
 
01:23:02.390 --> 01:23:02.400 align:start position:0%
that's comparable to that number
 
01:23:04.950 --> 01:23:04.960 align:start position:0%
so the number that's currently there is
 
01:23:07.510 --> 01:23:07.520 align:start position:0%
the fy 21 adjusted authorized which is
 
01:23:09.830 --> 01:23:09.840 align:start position:0%
about 172 million dollars
 
01:23:12.709 --> 01:23:12.719 align:start position:0%
and to get up to the governor's numbers
 
01:23:13.950 --> 01:23:13.960 align:start position:0%
requires about
 
01:23:18.149 --> 01:23:18.159 align:start position:0%
16.7 million dollars in fy 22
 
01:23:21.990 --> 01:23:22.000 align:start position:0%
and about 34.5 million dollars in
 
01:23:25.510 --> 01:23:25.520 align:start position:0%
fy 23 to get to the two-hole that takes
 
01:23:27.189 --> 01:23:27.199 align:start position:0%
her the 207 million dollars he has
 
01:23:29.910 --> 01:23:29.920 align:start position:0%
budgeted there
 
01:23:32.390 --> 01:23:32.400 align:start position:0%
i that's a that's good information but
 
01:23:34.390 --> 01:23:34.400 align:start position:0%
it's not the answer to my question
 
01:23:35.910 --> 01:23:35.920 align:start position:0%
oh i'm sorry
 
01:23:38.709 --> 01:23:38.719 align:start position:0%
that's right let me let me try it again
 
01:23:38.719 --> 01:23:40.070 align:start position:0%
that's right let me let me try it again
so

01:23:40.070 --> 01:23:40.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:23:42.629 --> 01:23:42.639 align:start position:0%
in in this particular
 
01:23:44.149 --> 01:23:44.159 align:start position:0%
uh cell
 
01:23:48.149 --> 01:23:48.159 align:start position:0%
of fy22 governors recommended
 
01:23:50.550 --> 01:23:50.560 align:start position:0%
you have a comparable cell on your
 
01:23:50.560 --> 01:23:51.990 align:start position:0%
you have a comparable cell on your
worksheet

01:23:51.990 --> 01:23:52.000 align:start position:0%
worksheet
 
01:23:55.669 --> 01:23:55.679 align:start position:0%
that used the fy 21 base
 
01:23:57.750 --> 01:23:57.760 align:start position:0%
and then
 
01:23:59.750 --> 01:23:59.760 align:start position:0%
projected a
 
01:24:01.189 --> 01:24:01.199 align:start position:0%
working number
 
01:24:03.030 --> 01:24:03.040 align:start position:0%
i'm asking you what your working number
 
01:24:03.040 --> 01:24:03.990 align:start position:0%
i'm asking you what your working number
was

01:24:03.990 --> 01:24:04.000 align:start position:0%
was
 
01:24:06.470 --> 01:24:06.480 align:start position:0%
that's comparable to the fy 22
 
01:24:09.750 --> 01:24:09.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:11.910 --> 01:24:11.920 align:start position:0%
it is the fy 21 adjusted authorized i
 
01:24:13.910 --> 01:24:13.920 align:start position:0%
did not make up numbers in between i
 
01:24:15.669 --> 01:24:15.679 align:start position:0%
either picked from
 
01:24:15.679 --> 01:24:16.470 align:start position:0%
either picked from
the

01:24:16.470 --> 01:24:16.480 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:24:18.950 --> 01:24:18.960 align:start position:0%
fy 22 governor
 
01:24:20.790 --> 01:24:20.800 align:start position:0%
budget for a particular account
 
01:24:23.430 --> 01:24:23.440 align:start position:0%
or i think from the fy 21 adjusted
 
01:24:26.070 --> 01:24:26.080 align:start position:0%
authorized foreign account in some cases
 
01:24:27.990 --> 01:24:28.000 align:start position:0%
after i'd picked one of the other
 
01:24:29.910 --> 01:24:29.920 align:start position:0%
the other one had lower lines i might
 
01:24:31.189 --> 01:24:31.199 align:start position:0%
have drawn a couple of those over but
 
01:24:32.709 --> 01:24:32.719 align:start position:0%
that was very rare
 
01:24:34.950 --> 01:24:34.960 align:start position:0%
okay so right now
 
01:24:38.629 --> 01:24:38.639 align:start position:0%
the the the the working number that uh
 
01:24:41.750 --> 01:24:41.760 align:start position:0%
your work document reflects is the 172
 
01:24:41.760 --> 01:24:42.950 align:start position:0%
your work document reflects is the 172
number

01:24:42.950 --> 01:24:42.960 align:start position:0%
number
 
01:24:45.830 --> 01:24:45.840 align:start position:0%
and it seems like we have a strong
 
01:24:48.149 --> 01:24:48.159 align:start position:0%
argument to bring it up to fully fund
 
01:24:49.430 --> 01:24:49.440 align:start position:0%
the governor's
 
01:24:52.790 --> 01:24:52.800 align:start position:0%
request 189 229
 
01:24:54.950 --> 01:24:54.960 align:start position:0%
and then in fy 23
 
01:24:57.590 --> 01:24:57.600 align:start position:0%
to 207 132.
 
01:25:00.550 --> 01:25:00.560 align:start position:0%
if if we were to do that
 
01:25:02.310 --> 01:25:02.320 align:start position:0%
what what's that total
 
01:25:04.629 --> 01:25:04.639 align:start position:0%
the the additional amount
 
01:25:09.270 --> 01:25:09.280 align:start position:0%
so in year one it's 16.6 or 16.7 roughly
 
01:25:12.070 --> 01:25:12.080 align:start position:0%
in year two 34.5
 
01:25:13.430 --> 01:25:13.440 align:start position:0%
if you have those together you get
 
01:25:16.310 --> 01:25:16.320 align:start position:0%
around what 51 million dollars over the
 
01:25:19.910 --> 01:25:19.920 align:start position:0%
two-year biennium difference
 
01:25:22.550 --> 01:25:22.560 align:start position:0%
so just to put that 51 million in
 
01:25:22.560 --> 01:25:25.030 align:start position:0%
so just to put that 51 million in
context

01:25:25.030 --> 01:25:25.040 align:start position:0%
context
 
01:25:29.270 --> 01:25:29.280 align:start position:0%
we had assumed i believe that we had
 
01:25:31.270 --> 01:25:31.280 align:start position:0%
about a hundred million dollars that we
 
01:25:33.350 --> 01:25:33.360 align:start position:0%
could add back from your working
 
01:25:36.229 --> 01:25:36.239 align:start position:0%
document and this is about 51 million so
 
01:25:38.390 --> 01:25:38.400 align:start position:0%
this is a this is a big
 
01:25:41.030 --> 01:25:41.040 align:start position:0%
a big bill so
 
01:25:42.870 --> 01:25:42.880 align:start position:0%
um but it seems like it's
 
01:25:45.590 --> 01:25:45.600 align:start position:0%
it's an appropriate bill
 
01:25:48.629 --> 01:25:48.639 align:start position:0%
i i i think we need to seriously
 
01:25:48.639 --> 01:25:49.990 align:start position:0%
i i i think we need to seriously
consider

01:25:49.990 --> 01:25:50.000 align:start position:0%
consider
 
01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:51.030 align:start position:0%
consider
uh

01:25:51.030 --> 01:25:51.040 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:25:54.070 --> 01:25:54.080 align:start position:0%
accepting the governor's recommended fy
 
01:25:56.870 --> 01:25:56.880 align:start position:0%
22 and 23 numbers for
 
01:25:56.880 --> 01:26:01.430 align:start position:0%
22 and 23 numbers for
79.48

01:26:01.430 --> 01:26:01.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:03.750 --> 01:26:03.760 align:start position:0%
is there any is there any discussion
 
01:26:06.229 --> 01:26:06.239 align:start position:0%
amongst the committee members on that
 
01:26:07.590 --> 01:26:07.600 align:start position:0%
that point
 
01:26:10.149 --> 01:26:10.159 align:start position:0%
representative wallner
 
01:26:11.910 --> 01:26:11.920 align:start position:0%
well i
 
01:26:13.990 --> 01:26:14.000 align:start position:0%
i just want to be sure that
 
01:26:16.229 --> 01:26:16.239 align:start position:0%
what we're doing here is
 
01:26:18.709 --> 01:26:18.719 align:start position:0%
um correct i i haven't even
 
01:26:20.470 --> 01:26:20.480 align:start position:0%
actually to tell you the truth and i
 
01:26:22.550 --> 01:26:22.560 align:start position:0%
haven't even found it in earth's
 
01:26:24.629 --> 01:26:24.639 align:start position:0%
representative earth's document
 
01:26:24.639 --> 01:26:25.830 align:start position:0%
representative earth's document
um

01:26:25.830 --> 01:26:25.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:26:27.189 --> 01:26:27.199 align:start position:0%
so i mean it's
 
01:26:29.830 --> 01:26:29.840 align:start position:0%
hard to find things in it and so i
 
01:26:31.270 --> 01:26:31.280 align:start position:0%
i would like to
 
01:26:34.629 --> 01:26:34.639 align:start position:0%
i'd like to have a minute to to look at
 
01:26:41.110 --> 01:26:41.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:42.470 --> 01:26:42.480 align:start position:0%
you're right the document that you're
 
01:26:43.830 --> 01:26:43.840 align:start position:0%
looking at that i've been looking at is
 
01:26:45.510 --> 01:26:45.520 align:start position:0%
out of order from the
 
01:26:47.350 --> 01:26:47.360 align:start position:0%
the pdf document
 
01:26:49.350 --> 01:26:49.360 align:start position:0%
um it's roughly a quarter of the way
 
01:26:49.360 --> 01:26:50.790 align:start position:0%
um it's roughly a quarter of the way
through

01:26:50.790 --> 01:26:50.800 align:start position:0%
through
 
01:26:52.550 --> 01:26:52.560 align:start position:0%
um it's in
 
01:26:52.560 --> 01:26:53.270 align:start position:0%
um it's in
the

01:26:53.270 --> 01:26:53.280 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:26:54.629 --> 01:26:54.639 align:start position:0%
the medic
 
01:26:56.470 --> 01:26:56.480 align:start position:0%
the division medicaid services title
 
01:26:58.310 --> 01:26:58.320 align:start position:0%
which is in i think is included in that
 
01:26:59.590 --> 01:26:59.600 align:start position:0%
document i'm looking not looking at it
 
01:27:01.590 --> 01:27:01.600 align:start position:0%
right now
 
01:27:03.830 --> 01:27:03.840 align:start position:0%
what's the second column from the left
 
01:27:05.910 --> 01:27:05.920 align:start position:0%
well one thing about it is it's got 80
 
01:27:08.629 --> 01:27:08.639 align:start position:0%
pages this document so it does have page
 
01:27:10.629 --> 01:27:10.639 align:start position:0%
numbers so if we could at least get to
 
01:27:13.110 --> 01:27:13.120 align:start position:0%
the page numbers i think it would be
 
01:27:15.189 --> 01:27:15.199 align:start position:0%
i think i just got to the page number i
 
01:27:18.310 --> 01:27:18.320 align:start position:0%
think if as we talk about this i think
 
01:27:20.390 --> 01:27:20.400 align:start position:0%
if we can at least get to the correct
 
01:27:22.550 --> 01:27:22.560 align:start position:0%
page numbers i don't see how anyone's
 
01:27:23.990 --> 01:27:24.000 align:start position:0%
ever going to be able to follow what
 
01:27:25.750 --> 01:27:25.760 align:start position:0%
we're doing here
 
01:27:27.669 --> 01:27:27.679 align:start position:0%
if we can't even let me let me get there
 
01:27:29.590 --> 01:27:29.600 align:start position:0%
so i can do that with you i was
 
01:27:29.600 --> 01:27:30.830 align:start position:0%
so i can do that with you i was
i

01:27:30.830 --> 01:27:30.840 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:27:33.189 --> 01:27:33.199 align:start position:0%
apologize i would like to take the
 
01:27:35.910 --> 01:27:35.920 align:start position:0%
tutorial on representative irf's
 
01:27:35.920 --> 01:27:37.189 align:start position:0%
tutorial on representative irf's
worksheet

01:27:37.189 --> 01:27:37.199 align:start position:0%
worksheet
 
01:27:39.189 --> 01:27:39.199 align:start position:0%
uh offline
 
01:27:41.430 --> 01:27:41.440 align:start position:0%
um because i do think
 
01:27:44.149 --> 01:27:44.159 align:start position:0%
that we have in on this particular line
 
01:27:44.159 --> 01:27:45.430 align:start position:0%
that we have in on this particular line
item

01:27:45.430 --> 01:27:45.440 align:start position:0%
item
 
01:27:47.669 --> 01:27:47.679 align:start position:0%
the clarity that is really important
 
01:27:48.709 --> 01:27:48.719 align:start position:0%
which is
 
01:27:50.790 --> 01:27:50.800 align:start position:0%
that if we accept the governor's
 
01:27:52.390 --> 01:27:52.400 align:start position:0%
recommended budget
 
01:27:57.270 --> 01:27:57.280 align:start position:0%
for 22 and 23 in account 79.48
 
01:27:58.709 --> 01:27:58.719 align:start position:0%
then that
 
01:28:00.790 --> 01:28:00.800 align:start position:0%
is going to
 
01:28:03.350 --> 01:28:03.360 align:start position:0%
require us to apply
 
01:28:06.310 --> 01:28:06.320 align:start position:0%
approximately 51 million
 
01:28:07.270 --> 01:28:07.280 align:start position:0%
of the
 
01:28:07.280 --> 01:28:08.870 align:start position:0%
of the
approximately

01:28:08.870 --> 01:28:08.880 align:start position:0%
approximately
 
01:28:10.470 --> 01:28:10.480 align:start position:0%
100 million
 
01:28:10.480 --> 01:28:11.750 align:start position:0%
100 million
that

01:28:11.750 --> 01:28:11.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:28:14.149 --> 01:28:14.159 align:start position:0%
that representative earth identified in
 
01:28:17.830 --> 01:28:17.840 align:start position:0%
this process so so we just spent half
 
01:28:20.709 --> 01:28:20.719 align:start position:0%
of the funds that we have available for
 
01:28:21.990 --> 01:28:22.000 align:start position:0%
add backs
 
01:28:33.030 --> 01:28:33.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:34.390 --> 01:28:34.400 align:start position:0%
mr chairman
 
01:28:36.950 --> 01:28:36.960 align:start position:0%
this uh page isn't it a summation of
 
01:28:39.750 --> 01:28:39.760 align:start position:0%
several previous earlier pages and uh
 
01:28:41.510 --> 01:28:41.520 align:start position:0%
earlier aus
 
01:28:44.310 --> 01:28:44.320 align:start position:0%
that are included in this these figures
 
01:28:46.870 --> 01:28:46.880 align:start position:0%
is that true mr ripple
 
01:28:49.430 --> 01:28:49.440 align:start position:0%
these represent one accounting unit only
 
01:28:52.070 --> 01:28:52.080 align:start position:0%
7948 medicaid care management it does
 
01:28:53.750 --> 01:28:53.760 align:start position:0%
not reflect the other
 
01:29:04.629 --> 01:29:04.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:07.030 --> 01:29:07.040 align:start position:0%
i think that answers your question but
 
01:29:08.870 --> 01:29:08.880 align:start position:0%
just to restate what i'm assuming we're
 
01:29:10.709 --> 01:29:10.719 align:start position:0%
looking at is we're looking at the money
 
01:29:13.590 --> 01:29:13.600 align:start position:0%
that becomes available for contracts to
 
01:29:17.830 --> 01:29:17.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:22.149 --> 01:29:22.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:22.159 --> 01:29:23.030 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:29:23.030 --> 01:29:23.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:29:25.110 --> 01:29:25.120 align:start position:0%
representative nordgren i see you have
 
01:29:26.870 --> 01:29:26.880 align:start position:0%
your hand up
 
01:29:29.910 --> 01:29:29.920 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um i guess i have a
 
01:29:33.430 --> 01:29:33.440 align:start position:0%
problem with offline discussions i think
 
01:29:35.510 --> 01:29:35.520 align:start position:0%
all of us probably have the same
 
01:29:38.629 --> 01:29:38.639 align:start position:0%
concerns that representative wallner has
 
01:29:40.390 --> 01:29:40.400 align:start position:0%
so i'm not sure
 
01:29:42.790 --> 01:29:42.800 align:start position:0%
what an offline discussion with her
 
01:29:42.800 --> 01:29:43.750 align:start position:0%
what an offline discussion with her
might

01:29:43.750 --> 01:29:43.760 align:start position:0%
might
 
01:29:46.070 --> 01:29:46.080 align:start position:0%
help the rest of us
 
01:29:46.080 --> 01:29:47.270 align:start position:0%
help the rest of us
just

01:29:47.270 --> 01:29:47.280 align:start position:0%
just
 
01:29:49.590 --> 01:29:49.600 align:start position:0%
i i hear you yeah
 
01:29:49.600 --> 01:29:50.390 align:start position:0%
i i hear you yeah
remember

01:29:50.390 --> 01:29:50.400 align:start position:0%
remember
 
01:29:52.950 --> 01:29:52.960 align:start position:0%
mr wait a second
 
01:29:55.350 --> 01:29:55.360 align:start position:0%
representative nordgren i i i accept
 
01:29:56.629 --> 01:29:56.639 align:start position:0%
your premise
 
01:30:00.149 --> 01:30:00.159 align:start position:0%
um and i will schedule a chance for
 
01:30:02.470 --> 01:30:02.480 align:start position:0%
uh representative irf to walk through
 
01:30:04.229 --> 01:30:04.239 align:start position:0%
his working document
 
01:30:06.709 --> 01:30:06.719 align:start position:0%
uh representative irf
 
01:30:09.110 --> 01:30:09.120 align:start position:0%
tomorrow morning would you
 
01:30:10.950 --> 01:30:10.960 align:start position:0%
be prepared please
 
01:30:14.550 --> 01:30:14.560 align:start position:0%
to give us a tutorial on the uses and
 
01:30:14.560 --> 01:30:16.470 align:start position:0%
to give us a tutorial on the uses and
limitations

01:30:16.470 --> 01:30:16.480 align:start position:0%
limitations
 
01:30:19.350 --> 01:30:19.360 align:start position:0%
of your working document i think it's
 
01:30:21.430 --> 01:30:21.440 align:start position:0%
important to keep note
 
01:30:24.790 --> 01:30:24.800 align:start position:0%
of what it is not it is not our proposal
 
01:30:26.550 --> 01:30:26.560 align:start position:0%
it's just a
 
01:30:29.189 --> 01:30:29.199 align:start position:0%
baseline for us to reference as we add
 
01:30:29.199 --> 01:30:30.709 align:start position:0%
baseline for us to reference as we add
back

01:30:30.709 --> 01:30:30.719 align:start position:0%
back
 
01:30:33.430 --> 01:30:33.440 align:start position:0%
money to these lines
 
01:30:34.950 --> 01:30:34.960 align:start position:0%
the short answer is yes but let me just
 
01:30:36.629 --> 01:30:36.639 align:start position:0%
expound a little bit i would just not
 
01:30:39.030 --> 01:30:39.040 align:start position:0%
prepare to give page numbers i am i can
 
01:30:41.590 --> 01:30:41.600 align:start position:0%
do it now see at the same time i i do
 
01:30:43.590 --> 01:30:43.600 align:start position:0%
not want to do that but that would just
 
01:30:46.390 --> 01:30:46.400 align:start position:0%
help them see the numbers it's very easy
 
01:30:49.350 --> 01:30:49.360 align:start position:0%
i do not want to do that now i want to
 
01:30:51.910 --> 01:30:51.920 align:start position:0%
stay on the agenda and stay talking
 
01:30:51.920 --> 01:30:52.950 align:start position:0%
stay on the agenda and stay talking
about

01:30:52.950 --> 01:30:52.960 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:30:54.149 --> 01:30:54.159 align:start position:0%
the five
 
01:30:57.270 --> 01:30:57.280 align:start position:0%
major funds that we have to discuss
 
01:30:59.189 --> 01:30:59.199 align:start position:0%
we're now talking about one of them
 
01:31:01.910 --> 01:31:01.920 align:start position:0%
we're talking about medicaid i i want to
 
01:31:03.910 --> 01:31:03.920 align:start position:0%
make sure that we leave time to talk
 
01:31:05.590 --> 01:31:05.600 align:start position:0%
about chip
 
01:31:08.149 --> 01:31:08.159 align:start position:0%
uh i want to talk about tanf i want to
 
01:31:10.470 --> 01:31:10.480 align:start position:0%
talk about mmis
 
01:31:12.390 --> 01:31:12.400 align:start position:0%
and can i just tell them what page to
 
01:31:13.510 --> 01:31:13.520 align:start position:0%
look at
 
01:31:13.520 --> 01:31:14.390 align:start position:0%
look at
sure

01:31:14.390 --> 01:31:14.400 align:start position:0%
sure
 
01:31:16.470 --> 01:31:16.480 align:start position:0%
mr chairman so it's the bottom on page
 
01:31:21.510 --> 01:31:21.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:23.189 --> 01:31:23.199 align:start position:0%
mr chair
 
01:31:25.270 --> 01:31:25.280 align:start position:0%
yes thank you
 
01:31:28.870 --> 01:31:28.880 align:start position:0%
thank you i don't have a copy of that 80
 
01:31:31.590 --> 01:31:31.600 align:start position:0%
page document and i'm not planning
 
01:31:34.790 --> 01:31:34.800 align:start position:0%
to spend my printer ink on it so
 
01:31:37.030 --> 01:31:37.040 align:start position:0%
it's a little difficult
 
01:31:40.790 --> 01:31:40.800 align:start position:0%
to try to figure it out when we're
 
01:31:43.189 --> 01:31:43.199 align:start position:0%
we don't have availability of it but we
 
01:31:44.870 --> 01:31:44.880 align:start position:0%
could i guess we'll put it up on our
 
01:31:46.870 --> 01:31:46.880 align:start position:0%
computers and hopefully we'll figure it
 
01:31:46.880 --> 01:31:50.550 align:start position:0%
computers and hopefully we'll figure it
out

01:31:50.550 --> 01:31:50.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:52.470 --> 01:31:52.480 align:start position:0%
the representative i mean i represent
 
01:31:53.990 --> 01:31:54.000 align:start position:0%
could kevin put it up
 
01:31:56.390 --> 01:31:56.400 align:start position:0%
i can give him page numbers as we go yup
 
01:32:08.550 --> 01:32:08.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:11.189 --> 01:32:11.199 align:start position:0%
gonna rely on hope we're going to rely
 
01:32:14.870 --> 01:32:14.880 align:start position:0%
on making sure again that this document
 
01:32:17.030 --> 01:32:17.040 align:start position:0%
is available to you we talked this
 
01:32:18.790 --> 01:32:18.800 align:start position:0%
morning about how it's going to be hung
 
01:32:21.510 --> 01:32:21.520 align:start position:0%
on our public website once it's properly
 
01:32:21.520 --> 01:32:22.950 align:start position:0%
on our public website once it's properly
watermarked

01:32:22.950 --> 01:32:22.960 align:start position:0%
watermarked
 
01:32:25.270 --> 01:32:25.280 align:start position:0%
and tomorrow morning representative
 
01:32:28.950 --> 01:32:28.960 align:start position:0%
earth is going to give us a tutorial on
 
01:32:33.189 --> 01:32:33.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:39.350 --> 01:32:39.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:40.550 --> 01:32:40.560 align:start position:0%
and there's the account there at the
 
01:32:47.270 --> 01:32:47.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:51.350 --> 01:32:51.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:55.270 --> 01:32:55.280 align:start position:0%
it's down thank you
 
01:32:56.149 --> 01:32:56.159 align:start position:0%
all right
 
01:32:56.159 --> 01:32:57.510 align:start position:0%
all right
so

01:32:57.510 --> 01:32:57.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:32:57.520 --> 01:32:59.270 align:start position:0%
so
um

01:32:59.270 --> 01:32:59.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:33:01.189 --> 01:33:01.199 align:start position:0%
let's go back to the page you were
 
01:33:03.750 --> 01:33:03.760 align:start position:0%
sharing mr ripple on
 
01:33:03.760 --> 01:33:04.629 align:start position:0%
sharing mr ripple on
um

01:33:04.629 --> 01:33:04.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:33:08.070 --> 01:33:08.080 align:start position:0%
the governor's budget
 
01:33:11.189 --> 01:33:11.199 align:start position:0%
uh yes let me just find where i
 
01:33:11.199 --> 01:33:19.510 align:start position:0%
uh yes let me just find where i
right

01:33:19.510 --> 01:33:19.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:20.870 --> 01:33:20.880 align:start position:0%
there we are
 
01:33:25.110 --> 01:33:25.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:26.229 --> 01:33:26.239 align:start position:0%
all right
 
01:33:28.229 --> 01:33:28.239 align:start position:0%
so so what hopefully
 
01:33:31.110 --> 01:33:31.120 align:start position:0%
we're taking from this discussion
 
01:33:32.070 --> 01:33:32.080 align:start position:0%
is that
 
01:33:36.629 --> 01:33:36.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:39.669 --> 01:33:39.679 align:start position:0%
we probably ought to as a division
 
01:33:42.390 --> 01:33:42.400 align:start position:0%
uh agree to fully fund the governor's
 
01:33:42.400 --> 01:33:43.910 align:start position:0%
uh agree to fully fund the governor's
recommended

01:33:43.910 --> 01:33:43.920 align:start position:0%
recommended
 
01:33:45.830 --> 01:33:45.840 align:start position:0%
budget and
 
01:33:49.110 --> 01:33:49.120 align:start position:0%
and if we do that that will
 
01:33:49.120 --> 01:33:50.390 align:start position:0%
and if we do that that will
absorb

01:33:50.390 --> 01:33:50.400 align:start position:0%
absorb
 
01:33:53.110 --> 01:33:53.120 align:start position:0%
about 50 percent of the flexibility we
 
01:33:58.629 --> 01:33:58.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:58.639 --> 01:33:59.669 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:33:59.669 --> 01:33:59.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:34:03.110 --> 01:34:03.120 align:start position:0%
so we we will be talking about that uh
 
01:34:05.430 --> 01:34:05.440 align:start position:0%
in future meetings but but i think i
 
01:34:07.270 --> 01:34:07.280 align:start position:0%
think that's i want to put a stake in
 
01:34:10.950 --> 01:34:10.960 align:start position:0%
the ground here for us to talk about
 
01:34:13.750 --> 01:34:13.760 align:start position:0%
can we go to chip now can you do the
 
01:34:15.830 --> 01:34:15.840 align:start position:0%
same thing for chip
 
01:34:17.750 --> 01:34:17.760 align:start position:0%
yes and this is
 
01:34:19.189 --> 01:34:19.199 align:start position:0%
easy because it's the next accounting
 
01:34:19.199 --> 01:34:30.830 align:start position:0%
easy because it's the next accounting
unit

01:34:30.830 --> 01:34:30.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:33.270 --> 01:34:33.280 align:start position:0%
so excuse me
 
01:34:35.910 --> 01:34:35.920 align:start position:0%
so i see the general funds going up from
 
01:34:38.149 --> 01:34:38.159 align:start position:0%
essentially 24 million
 
01:34:40.709 --> 01:34:40.719 align:start position:0%
to essentially 38. that's
 
01:34:43.669 --> 01:34:43.679 align:start position:0%
about just in just under 14 million and
 
01:34:43.679 --> 01:34:45.669 align:start position:0%
about just in just under 14 million and
22

01:34:45.669 --> 01:34:45.679 align:start position:0%
22
 
01:34:49.510 --> 01:34:49.520 align:start position:0%
and that it barely goes up in 23.
 
01:34:51.910 --> 01:34:51.920 align:start position:0%
so so so ms rounds if you want to come
 
01:34:54.709 --> 01:34:54.719 align:start position:0%
in and tell us things like why it goes
 
01:34:57.350 --> 01:34:57.360 align:start position:0%
up so little in 23 and goes up so much
 
01:35:01.669 --> 01:35:01.679 align:start position:0%
in 22 that would be great sure so uh as
 
01:35:03.430 --> 01:35:03.440 align:start position:0%
i mentioned with the standard medicaid
 
01:35:06.470 --> 01:35:06.480 align:start position:0%
account with 7948 this is the first time
 
01:35:08.470 --> 01:35:08.480 align:start position:0%
or the second biennium
 
01:35:10.790 --> 01:35:10.800 align:start position:0%
that the chip accounting unit has
 
01:35:13.109 --> 01:35:13.119 align:start position:0%
existed and the first biennium that i
 
01:35:14.790 --> 01:35:14.800 align:start position:0%
would say that we're trying to actually
 
01:35:16.790 --> 01:35:16.800 align:start position:0%
level set this accounting unit where we
 
01:35:18.950 --> 01:35:18.960 align:start position:0%
anticipate it will be
 
01:35:18.960 --> 01:35:19.990 align:start position:0%
anticipate it will be
um

01:35:19.990 --> 01:35:20.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:35:22.310 --> 01:35:22.320 align:start position:0%
and we do as i mentioned have a fiscal
 
01:35:26.629 --> 01:35:26.639 align:start position:0%
committee uh item going um for the april
 
01:35:30.550 --> 01:35:30.560 align:start position:0%
agenda to transfer funds from 7948 to
 
01:35:33.189 --> 01:35:33.199 align:start position:0%
this accounting unit 7051 which would
 
01:35:35.189 --> 01:35:35.199 align:start position:0%
then change the adjusted authorized on
 
01:35:37.669 --> 01:35:37.679 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 21.
 
01:35:37.679 --> 01:35:38.629 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 21.
um

01:35:38.629 --> 01:35:38.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:35:41.430 --> 01:35:41.440 align:start position:0%
this is what is being reflected as some
 
01:35:44.550 --> 01:35:44.560 align:start position:0%
of the reduction in class line 101 uh
 
01:35:46.790 --> 01:35:46.800 align:start position:0%
when we looked at 79.48
 
01:35:49.990 --> 01:35:50.000 align:start position:0%
there was a reduction from 21
 
01:35:54.070 --> 01:35:54.080 align:start position:0%
to 22 in the uh total expenditure and
 
01:35:57.830 --> 01:35:57.840 align:start position:0%
that is essentially being moved to here
 
01:36:01.510 --> 01:36:01.520 align:start position:0%
the fund mix um is a little different in
 
01:36:03.510 --> 01:36:03.520 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 20
 
01:36:05.590 --> 01:36:05.600 align:start position:0%
because of the enhanced f map and the
 
01:36:07.510 --> 01:36:07.520 align:start position:0%
case will also be the same in fiscal
 
01:36:09.189 --> 01:36:09.199 align:start position:0%
year 22
 
01:36:11.270 --> 01:36:11.280 align:start position:0%
however on this account we have not made
 
01:36:13.189 --> 01:36:13.199 align:start position:0%
an adjustment for fiscal year
 
01:36:15.669 --> 01:36:15.679 align:start position:0%
i mean for fiscal year 21 we'll also
 
01:36:18.229 --> 01:36:18.239 align:start position:0%
have some enhanced fm we have not made
 
01:36:20.550 --> 01:36:20.560 align:start position:0%
an adjustment for fiscal year 22 in this
 
01:36:24.070 --> 01:36:24.080 align:start position:0%
accounting unit because we are still um
 
01:36:25.990 --> 01:36:26.000 align:start position:0%
trying to uh
 
01:36:29.109 --> 01:36:29.119 align:start position:0%
process if you will the most recent uh
 
01:36:31.350 --> 01:36:31.360 align:start position:0%
bill that passed at the federal level
 
01:36:33.590 --> 01:36:33.600 align:start position:0%
and it seems like the enhanced fmap
 
01:36:36.149 --> 01:36:36.159 align:start position:0%
might not apply to chip anymore and
 
01:36:38.310 --> 01:36:38.320 align:start position:0%
we're trying to understand and process
 
01:36:40.550 --> 01:36:40.560 align:start position:0%
uh that completely so we did not make
 
01:36:41.830 --> 01:36:41.840 align:start position:0%
any changes
 
01:36:44.790 --> 01:36:44.800 align:start position:0%
uh to fiscal year 22 regarding in an
 
01:36:46.950 --> 01:36:46.960 align:start position:0%
enhanced fm
 
01:36:49.910 --> 01:36:49.920 align:start position:0%
so the summary of that
 
01:36:52.470 --> 01:36:52.480 align:start position:0%
is that if you were to make adjustments
 
01:36:54.070 --> 01:36:54.080 align:start position:0%
based on some of the things you're
 
01:36:55.669 --> 01:36:55.679 align:start position:0%
thinking about
 
01:36:57.270 --> 01:36:57.280 align:start position:0%
would that
 
01:37:00.229 --> 01:37:00.239 align:start position:0%
increase the 37 million requests you
 
01:37:02.470 --> 01:37:02.480 align:start position:0%
think or would it decrease the 37
 
01:37:04.149 --> 01:37:04.159 align:start position:0%
million request
 
01:37:06.629 --> 01:37:06.639 align:start position:0%
so if the enhanced fmap does
 
01:37:09.750 --> 01:37:09.760 align:start position:0%
uh apply to the chip kids it would
 
01:37:11.750 --> 01:37:11.760 align:start position:0%
decrease the general funds
 
01:37:13.430 --> 01:37:13.440 align:start position:0%
um the other thing i should have
 
01:37:14.870 --> 01:37:14.880 align:start position:0%
mentioned on the standard medicaid
 
01:37:16.229 --> 01:37:16.239 align:start position:0%
account and of course applies to
 
01:37:17.910 --> 01:37:17.920 align:start position:0%
anywhere that we're making a medicaid
 
01:37:21.350 --> 01:37:21.360 align:start position:0%
payment is the 3.1 rate increase that
 
01:37:24.709 --> 01:37:24.719 align:start position:0%
happened um 1-1 of 21
 
01:37:27.830 --> 01:37:27.840 align:start position:0%
so anywhere in fiscal year 21 would only
 
01:37:30.310 --> 01:37:30.320 align:start position:0%
represent half a year of that rate
 
01:37:30.320 --> 01:37:32.470 align:start position:0%
represent half a year of that rate
increase

01:37:32.470 --> 01:37:32.480 align:start position:0%
increase
 
01:37:36.709 --> 01:37:36.719 align:start position:0%
okay i i i think you may have said it
 
01:37:38.550 --> 01:37:38.560 align:start position:0%
different than i was expecting to hear
 
01:37:38.560 --> 01:37:39.270 align:start position:0%
different than i was expecting to hear
it

01:37:39.270 --> 01:37:39.280 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:37:41.669 --> 01:37:41.679 align:start position:0%
i think what you were saying is that
 
01:37:46.709 --> 01:37:46.719 align:start position:0%
that in fy 22 for the 37.7 million
 
01:37:51.030 --> 01:37:51.040 align:start position:0%
you assumed the enhanced f map
 
01:37:53.350 --> 01:37:53.360 align:start position:0%
and that if you don't get the enhanced f
 
01:37:53.360 --> 01:37:54.390 align:start position:0%
and that if you don't get the enhanced f
map

01:37:54.390 --> 01:37:54.400 align:start position:0%
map
 
01:37:56.149 --> 01:37:56.159 align:start position:0%
then we have to come back and adjust
 
01:37:59.109 --> 01:37:59.119 align:start position:0%
this number if we have less enhanced
 
01:38:01.510 --> 01:38:01.520 align:start position:0%
fmap it seems to me like the general
 
01:38:04.390 --> 01:38:04.400 align:start position:0%
fund amount would have to go up
 
01:38:07.109 --> 01:38:07.119 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry no we we did not include any
 
01:38:10.149 --> 01:38:10.159 align:start position:0%
enhanced death map in 22 or 23
 
01:38:11.830 --> 01:38:11.840 align:start position:0%
in this accounting unit because we're
 
01:38:15.270 --> 01:38:15.280 align:start position:0%
not sure if it will change so it
 
01:38:17.270 --> 01:38:17.280 align:start position:0%
if we do end up getting the enhanced
 
01:38:19.910 --> 01:38:19.920 align:start position:0%
fmap we knew would need less general
 
01:38:22.470 --> 01:38:22.480 align:start position:0%
funds here but we don't have clarity yet
 
01:38:24.390 --> 01:38:24.400 align:start position:0%
as to whether we will
 
01:38:27.030 --> 01:38:27.040 align:start position:0%
appreciate that uh representative weiler
 
01:38:30.149 --> 01:38:30.159 align:start position:0%
do you have a question sir
 
01:38:32.229 --> 01:38:32.239 align:start position:0%
i'm curious as to why we go up more than
 
01:38:36.550 --> 01:38:36.560 align:start position:0%
50 from 21 to 22.
 
01:38:39.590 --> 01:38:39.600 align:start position:0%
so fiscal year 21 20 and 21 was the
 
01:38:41.270 --> 01:38:41.280 align:start position:0%
first biennium that we had this
 
01:38:43.350 --> 01:38:43.360 align:start position:0%
accounting unit and so we weren't
 
01:38:45.109 --> 01:38:45.119 align:start position:0%
entirely sure how
 
01:38:47.590 --> 01:38:47.600 align:start position:0%
at what level to budget it uh so fiscal
 
01:38:50.470 --> 01:38:50.480 align:start position:0%
year 21 is under budget it's it's not
 
01:38:52.070 --> 01:38:52.080 align:start position:0%
enough money and we have a fiscal
 
01:38:54.790 --> 01:38:54.800 align:start position:0%
committee item to adjust that to be
 
01:38:54.800 --> 01:38:57.590 align:start position:0%
committee item to adjust that to be
higher

01:38:57.590 --> 01:38:57.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:58.629 --> 01:38:58.639 align:start position:0%
yes sir
 
01:39:00.070 --> 01:39:00.080 align:start position:0%
i thought we'd had
 
01:39:02.950 --> 01:39:02.960 align:start position:0%
ships uh this children's health
 
01:39:06.790 --> 01:39:06.800 align:start position:0%
insurance program for for a decade
 
01:39:09.990 --> 01:39:10.000 align:start position:0%
we did and uh it used to be that these
 
01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:10.790 align:start position:0%
we did and uh it used to be that these
uh

01:39:10.790 --> 01:39:10.800 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:39:12.629 --> 01:39:12.639 align:start position:0%
these expenditures were just part of
 
01:39:12.639 --> 01:39:14.229 align:start position:0%
these expenditures were just part of
7948.

01:39:14.229 --> 01:39:14.239 align:start position:0%
7948.
 
01:39:16.910 --> 01:39:16.920 align:start position:0%
uh if you remember the single audit from
 
01:39:19.109 --> 01:39:19.119 align:start position:0%
2018 there was a finding on the
 
01:39:21.910 --> 01:39:21.920 align:start position:0%
department about our medicaid revenues
 
01:39:24.870 --> 01:39:24.880 align:start position:0%
not being transparent enough and so we
 
01:39:27.030 --> 01:39:27.040 align:start position:0%
created several accounting units um
 
01:39:29.189 --> 01:39:29.199 align:start position:0%
including this one to break out what was
 
01:39:32.629 --> 01:39:32.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:34.229 --> 01:39:34.239 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:39:35.590 --> 01:39:35.600 align:start position:0%
so to
 
01:39:35.600 --> 01:39:36.790 align:start position:0%
so to
visualize

01:39:36.790 --> 01:39:36.800 align:start position:0%
visualize
 
01:39:38.870 --> 01:39:38.880 align:start position:0%
the answer to representative weiler can
 
01:39:41.910 --> 01:39:41.920 align:start position:0%
can we scroll back up mr ripple to uh
 
01:39:45.350 --> 01:39:45.360 align:start position:0%
medicaid where we see fy22 dropping to
 
01:39:48.070 --> 01:39:48.080 align:start position:0%
the 706 number or whatever i think it's
 
01:39:49.669 --> 01:39:49.679 align:start position:0%
a little further up
 
01:39:54.709 --> 01:39:54.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:56.149 --> 01:39:56.159 align:start position:0%
so so
 
01:39:58.790 --> 01:39:58.800 align:start position:0%
i think on line 101 representative
 
01:39:58.800 --> 01:39:59.830 align:start position:0%
i think on line 101 representative
weiler

01:39:59.830 --> 01:39:59.840 align:start position:0%
weiler
 
01:40:03.350 --> 01:40:03.360 align:start position:0%
you'll you'll you'll see that uh in 20
 
01:40:03.360 --> 01:40:05.030 align:start position:0%
you'll you'll you'll see that uh in 20
um

01:40:05.030 --> 01:40:05.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:40:07.189 --> 01:40:07.199 align:start position:0%
20 and 21
 
01:40:09.430 --> 01:40:09.440 align:start position:0%
it was basically higher than it's going
 
01:40:11.990 --> 01:40:12.000 align:start position:0%
to be in 22 on this line item and that's
 
01:40:15.030 --> 01:40:15.040 align:start position:0%
because in part chip got moved
 
01:40:17.910 --> 01:40:17.920 align:start position:0%
and money money came out of this and got
 
01:40:20.709 --> 01:40:20.719 align:start position:0%
added to the chip line
 
01:40:24.550 --> 01:40:24.560 align:start position:0%
is it is that right ms rounds yes
 
01:40:27.350 --> 01:40:27.360 align:start position:0%
doesn't look like the same amount
 
01:40:29.910 --> 01:40:29.920 align:start position:0%
it wouldn't be because of that 3.1 rate
 
01:40:29.920 --> 01:40:32.070 align:start position:0%
it wouldn't be because of that 3.1 rate
increase

01:40:32.070 --> 01:40:32.080 align:start position:0%
increase
 
01:40:34.310 --> 01:40:34.320 align:start position:0%
that's that's going to affect it
 
01:40:38.550 --> 01:40:38.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:38.560 --> 01:40:40.470 align:start position:0%
 
officer

01:40:40.470 --> 01:40:40.480 align:start position:0%
officer
 
01:40:42.310 --> 01:40:42.320 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:40:44.550 --> 01:40:44.560 align:start position:0%
all right um
 
01:40:46.310 --> 01:40:46.320 align:start position:0%
let's go back to the chip line where we
 
01:40:50.870 --> 01:40:50.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:50.880 --> 01:40:53.030 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:40:53.030 --> 01:40:53.040 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:40:53.040 --> 01:40:54.390 align:start position:0%
okay
so

01:40:54.390 --> 01:40:54.400 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:40:58.070 --> 01:40:58.080 align:start position:0%
miss rounds i'm i'm so sorry let's let's
 
01:41:01.830 --> 01:41:01.840 align:start position:0%
just for for for people uh out in the
 
01:41:05.669 --> 01:41:05.679 align:start position:0%
audience and for me as well
 
01:41:08.070 --> 01:41:08.080 align:start position:0%
tell me again exactly
 
01:41:11.669 --> 01:41:11.679 align:start position:0%
who is eligible for the chip program and
 
01:41:11.679 --> 01:41:12.550 align:start position:0%
who is eligible for the chip program and
and

01:41:12.550 --> 01:41:12.560 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:41:15.590 --> 01:41:15.600 align:start position:0%
and how that's used to purchase
 
01:41:16.830 --> 01:41:16.840 align:start position:0%
direct health
 
01:41:16.840 --> 01:41:18.550 align:start position:0%
direct health
care

01:41:18.550 --> 01:41:18.560 align:start position:0%
care
 
01:41:18.560 --> 01:41:19.669 align:start position:0%
care
so

01:41:19.669 --> 01:41:19.679 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:41:21.350 --> 01:41:21.360 align:start position:0%
i'm just looking through the attendees
 
01:41:23.910 --> 01:41:23.920 align:start position:0%
to see if henry was on or
 
01:41:26.790 --> 01:41:26.800 align:start position:0%
um i i can't answer that
 
01:41:27.910 --> 01:41:27.920 align:start position:0%
and not
 
01:41:27.920 --> 01:41:28.950 align:start position:0%
and not
okay

01:41:28.950 --> 01:41:28.960 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:41:31.910 --> 01:41:31.920 align:start position:0%
but he needed its children and they are
 
01:41:34.149 --> 01:41:34.159 align:start position:0%
part this these payments would also go
 
01:41:36.310 --> 01:41:36.320 align:start position:0%
to the mcos it's all part of the mco
 
01:41:36.320 --> 01:41:37.510 align:start position:0%
to the mcos it's all part of the mco
contract

01:41:37.510 --> 01:41:37.520 align:start position:0%
contract
 
01:41:39.510 --> 01:41:39.520 align:start position:0%
okay i thought this might be part of a
 
01:41:41.350 --> 01:41:41.360 align:start position:0%
fee for service
 
01:41:43.669 --> 01:41:43.679 align:start position:0%
section of what we spend money on
 
01:41:45.430 --> 01:41:45.440 align:start position:0%
because it's more of an insurance
 
01:41:45.440 --> 01:41:47.350 align:start position:0%
because it's more of an insurance
product

01:41:47.350 --> 01:41:47.360 align:start position:0%
product
 
01:41:51.189 --> 01:41:51.199 align:start position:0%
no they they are part of the mcos
 
01:41:51.199 --> 01:41:52.070 align:start position:0%
no they they are part of the mcos
okay

01:41:52.070 --> 01:41:52.080 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:41:54.390 --> 01:41:54.400 align:start position:0%
a different uh eligibility group if you
 
01:41:54.400 --> 01:41:55.669 align:start position:0%
a different uh eligibility group if you
will

01:41:55.669 --> 01:41:55.679 align:start position:0%
will
 
01:41:55.679 --> 01:41:56.550 align:start position:0%
will
okay

01:41:56.550 --> 01:41:56.560 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:41:56.560 --> 01:41:57.830 align:start position:0%
okay
so

01:41:57.830 --> 01:41:57.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:41:57.840 --> 01:41:58.629 align:start position:0%
so
uh

01:41:58.629 --> 01:41:58.639 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:42:02.229 --> 01:42:02.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:05.910 --> 01:42:05.920 align:start position:0%
so what i'm thinking is as we look at
 
01:42:09.990 --> 01:42:10.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:11.590 --> 01:42:11.600 align:start position:0%
we probably
 
01:42:13.109 --> 01:42:13.119 align:start position:0%
are are
 
01:42:15.430 --> 01:42:15.440 align:start position:0%
wanting to fully fund the governor's
 
01:42:17.430 --> 01:42:17.440 align:start position:0%
recommended budget
 
01:42:19.910 --> 01:42:19.920 align:start position:0%
because i think this is money
 
01:42:22.790 --> 01:42:22.800 align:start position:0%
that that ends up setting up
 
01:42:24.629 --> 01:42:24.639 align:start position:0%
direct health care
 
01:42:29.590 --> 01:42:29.600 align:start position:0%
and and to me that's um a priority
 
01:42:29.600 --> 01:42:30.390 align:start position:0%
and and to me that's um a priority
so

01:42:30.390 --> 01:42:30.400 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:42:30.400 --> 01:42:31.270 align:start position:0%
so
um

01:42:31.270 --> 01:42:31.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:42:33.669 --> 01:42:33.679 align:start position:0%
and i'm now did you or can you can you
 
01:42:35.830 --> 01:42:35.840 align:start position:0%
keep that highlighted uh mr ripple
 
01:42:37.990 --> 01:42:38.000 align:start position:0%
because i lose sight of it
 
01:42:41.669 --> 01:42:41.679 align:start position:0%
it looks like um that's going to
 
01:42:41.679 --> 01:42:43.430 align:start position:0%
it looks like um that's going to
absorb

01:42:43.430 --> 01:42:43.440 align:start position:0%
absorb
 
01:42:46.629 --> 01:42:46.639 align:start position:0%
about 27 to 28 million
 
01:42:46.639 --> 01:42:47.510 align:start position:0%
about 27 to 28 million
of

01:42:47.510 --> 01:42:47.520 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:42:47.520 --> 01:42:49.270 align:start position:0%
of
the

01:42:49.270 --> 01:42:49.280 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:42:51.109 --> 01:42:51.119 align:start position:0%
funds that we have available for add
 
01:42:51.119 --> 01:42:54.149 align:start position:0%
funds that we have available for add
back

01:42:54.149 --> 01:42:54.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:54.950 --> 01:42:54.960 align:start position:0%
do you
 
01:42:56.950 --> 01:42:56.960 align:start position:0%
do you agree with that representative if
 
01:42:59.990 --> 01:43:00.000 align:start position:0%
we if we add this if we add
 
01:43:03.430 --> 01:43:03.440 align:start position:0%
to your work document fy 22 general
 
01:43:08.550 --> 01:43:08.560 align:start position:0%
funds for 70 51 and 23
 
01:43:12.149 --> 01:43:12.159 align:start position:0%
that that that that takes another 27 28
 
01:43:14.310 --> 01:43:14.320 align:start position:0%
million doesn't it
 
01:43:16.870 --> 01:43:16.880 align:start position:0%
correct and that's on page 18
 
01:43:18.790 --> 01:43:18.800 align:start position:0%
of the pdf
 
01:43:21.270 --> 01:43:21.280 align:start position:0%
if we take 50 and 28
 
01:43:23.430 --> 01:43:23.440 align:start position:0%
we're now at 78
 
01:43:26.950 --> 01:43:26.960 align:start position:0%
million of the approximately 100 million
 
01:43:28.470 --> 01:43:28.480 align:start position:0%
that we
 
01:43:30.070 --> 01:43:30.080 align:start position:0%
have overall
 
01:43:32.070 --> 01:43:32.080 align:start position:0%
that right now based on the ways and
 
01:43:34.709 --> 01:43:34.719 align:start position:0%
means estimate that we can add back
 
01:43:37.990 --> 01:43:38.000 align:start position:0%
so we're down to about 22 million or so
 
01:43:39.830 --> 01:43:39.840 align:start position:0%
and in this one
 
01:43:41.590 --> 01:43:41.600 align:start position:0%
we give ourselves a little bit of a
 
01:43:41.600 --> 01:43:42.709 align:start position:0%
we give ourselves a little bit of a
problem

01:43:42.709 --> 01:43:42.719 align:start position:0%
problem
 
01:43:44.870 --> 01:43:44.880 align:start position:0%
in that we're expecting those revenue
 
01:43:47.270 --> 01:43:47.280 align:start position:0%
flows to come in
 
01:43:52.070 --> 01:43:52.080 align:start position:0%
um greater in 23 than 22 and and we're
 
01:43:53.910 --> 01:43:53.920 align:start position:0%
we're using the same number in both
 
01:43:53.920 --> 01:43:55.430 align:start position:0%
we're using the same number in both
years

01:43:55.430 --> 01:43:55.440 align:start position:0%
years
 
01:43:57.830 --> 01:43:57.840 align:start position:0%
i think we were trying to keep a
 
01:43:59.830 --> 01:43:59.840 align:start position:0%
one-third two-thirds
 
01:44:02.709 --> 01:44:02.719 align:start position:0%
rule but this would violate that
 
01:44:04.470 --> 01:44:04.480 align:start position:0%
representative nordgren do you have a
 
01:44:07.270 --> 01:44:07.280 align:start position:0%
comment or a question yeah i'm sorry
 
01:44:08.629 --> 01:44:08.639 align:start position:0%
this is probably
 
01:44:10.950 --> 01:44:10.960 align:start position:0%
not the right place to ask it but you
 
01:44:12.229 --> 01:44:12.239 align:start position:0%
did mention
 
01:44:13.990 --> 01:44:14.000 align:start position:0%
the ways and means committee and i was
 
01:44:16.629 --> 01:44:16.639 align:start position:0%
just wondering what the status was of
 
01:44:18.310 --> 01:44:18.320 align:start position:0%
the conversations
 
01:44:18.320 --> 01:44:19.109 align:start position:0%
the conversations
that

01:44:19.109 --> 01:44:19.119 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:44:21.350 --> 01:44:21.360 align:start position:0%
a representative weiler has been having
 
01:44:24.390 --> 01:44:24.400 align:start position:0%
with uh representative major in ways and
 
01:44:27.030 --> 01:44:27.040 align:start position:0%
means are they planning to revisit their
 
01:44:27.040 --> 01:44:28.149 align:start position:0%
means are they planning to revisit their
numbers

01:44:28.149 --> 01:44:28.159 align:start position:0%
numbers
 
01:44:28.159 --> 01:44:28.950 align:start position:0%
numbers
i

01:44:28.950 --> 01:44:28.960 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:44:30.950 --> 01:44:30.960 align:start position:0%
the short answer to that is yes and i'll
 
01:44:32.870 --> 01:44:32.880 align:start position:0%
let representative weiler provide a
 
01:44:36.070 --> 01:44:36.080 align:start position:0%
longer answer if he if he cares to
 
01:44:40.229 --> 01:44:40.239 align:start position:0%
but at this point in this exercise
 
01:44:42.629 --> 01:44:42.639 align:start position:0%
we have not been told anything other
 
01:44:44.790 --> 01:44:44.800 align:start position:0%
than the ways and means estimate that
 
01:44:46.790 --> 01:44:46.800 align:start position:0%
the house voted on that we're still
 
01:44:49.510 --> 01:44:49.520 align:start position:0%
using that for our planning
 
01:44:53.350 --> 01:44:53.360 align:start position:0%
so if we are are lucky enough for ways
 
01:44:55.350 --> 01:44:55.360 align:start position:0%
and means to come back and give us more
 
01:44:55.360 --> 01:44:56.229 align:start position:0%
and means to come back and give us more
money

01:44:56.229 --> 01:44:56.239 align:start position:0%
money
 
01:44:58.229 --> 01:44:58.239 align:start position:0%
this exercise we're going through right
 
01:45:01.350 --> 01:45:01.360 align:start position:0%
now is still useful and relevant
 
01:45:04.310 --> 01:45:04.320 align:start position:0%
so representative weiler do you want to
 
01:45:06.390 --> 01:45:06.400 align:start position:0%
talk about where you're at with ways and
 
01:45:08.310 --> 01:45:08.320 align:start position:0%
means sir
 
01:45:12.950 --> 01:45:12.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:14.870 --> 01:45:14.880 align:start position:0%
that's that's really soon i didn't think
 
01:45:17.350 --> 01:45:17.360 align:start position:0%
we'd hear until tuesday the 23rd so i
 
01:45:19.350 --> 01:45:19.360 align:start position:0%
like a friday answer better
 
01:45:21.270 --> 01:45:21.280 align:start position:0%
well i'm not sure that's that was a kind
 
01:45:22.950 --> 01:45:22.960 align:start position:0%
of a preliminary thing
 
01:45:26.550 --> 01:45:26.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:29.510 --> 01:45:29.520 align:start position:0%
did representative
 
01:45:31.910 --> 01:45:31.920 align:start position:0%
yes so when i was looking at uh
 
01:45:34.390 --> 01:45:34.400 align:start position:0%
representative erf's documents
 
01:45:34.400 --> 01:45:35.510 align:start position:0%
representative erf's documents
um

01:45:35.510 --> 01:45:35.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:45:38.229 --> 01:45:38.239 align:start position:0%
it looked like
 
01:45:41.629 --> 01:45:41.639 align:start position:0%
he had reduced the governor's budget by
 
01:45:45.430 --> 01:45:45.440 align:start position:0%
159 million
 
01:45:45.440 --> 01:45:46.629 align:start position:0%
159 million
no

01:45:46.629 --> 01:45:46.639 align:start position:0%
no
 
01:45:48.950 --> 01:45:48.960 align:start position:0%
no no no no
 
01:45:52.629 --> 01:45:52.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:56.950 --> 01:45:56.960 align:start position:0%
well it's 50 159 million less
 
01:45:59.990 --> 01:46:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:04.310 --> 01:46:04.320 align:start position:0%
the governor's budget is uh 159 million
 
01:46:04.320 --> 01:46:05.430 align:start position:0%
the governor's budget is uh 159 million
more

01:46:05.430 --> 01:46:05.440 align:start position:0%
more
 
01:46:05.440 --> 01:46:06.310 align:start position:0%
more
than

01:46:06.310 --> 01:46:06.320 align:start position:0%
than
 
01:46:10.870 --> 01:46:10.880 align:start position:0%
the fy 21 adjusted base and
 
01:46:13.030 --> 01:46:13.040 align:start position:0%
and he uses a different revenue
 
01:46:16.149 --> 01:46:16.159 align:start position:0%
estimation process and so he had
 
01:46:18.390 --> 01:46:18.400 align:start position:0%
greater amounts of revenues to use in
 
01:46:21.590 --> 01:46:21.600 align:start position:0%
his separate distinguishable independent
 
01:46:21.600 --> 01:46:22.790 align:start position:0%
his separate distinguishable independent
effort

01:46:22.790 --> 01:46:22.800 align:start position:0%
effort
 
01:46:26.950 --> 01:46:26.960 align:start position:0%
we are using the new hampshire house
 
01:46:26.960 --> 01:46:28.229 align:start position:0%
we are using the new hampshire house
process

01:46:28.229 --> 01:46:28.239 align:start position:0%
process
 
01:46:31.350 --> 01:46:31.360 align:start position:0%
of of of taking a look at our current
 
01:46:31.360 --> 01:46:32.390 align:start position:0%
of of of taking a look at our current
budget

01:46:32.390 --> 01:46:32.400 align:start position:0%
budget
 
01:46:34.709 --> 01:46:34.719 align:start position:0%
taking a look at the ways and means
 
01:46:34.719 --> 01:46:35.910 align:start position:0%
taking a look at the ways and means
estimates

01:46:35.910 --> 01:46:35.920 align:start position:0%
estimates
 
01:46:38.550 --> 01:46:38.560 align:start position:0%
and determining how much that weighs and
 
01:46:41.750 --> 01:46:41.760 align:start position:0%
means estimate how much money that gives
 
01:46:41.760 --> 01:46:42.550 align:start position:0%
means estimate how much money that gives
us

01:46:42.550 --> 01:46:42.560 align:start position:0%
us
 
01:46:46.149 --> 01:46:46.159 align:start position:0%
to enhance the fy 21 base
 
01:46:49.750 --> 01:46:49.760 align:start position:0%
we're using different techniques
 
01:46:52.229 --> 01:46:52.239 align:start position:0%
than the governor because he has more
 
01:46:54.790 --> 01:46:54.800 align:start position:0%
flexibility on revenue estimates than we
 
01:46:54.800 --> 01:46:55.510 align:start position:0%
flexibility on revenue estimates than we
do

01:46:55.510 --> 01:46:55.520 align:start position:0%
do
 
01:46:57.350 --> 01:46:57.360 align:start position:0%
okay i i understand that part but i'm
 
01:46:59.189 --> 01:46:59.199 align:start position:0%
just trying to i'm just trying to figure
 
01:47:02.229 --> 01:47:02.239 align:start position:0%
out so you're saying you're
 
01:47:05.350 --> 01:47:05.360 align:start position:0%
to your base you're adding back 100
 
01:47:05.360 --> 01:47:06.870 align:start position:0%
to your base you're adding back 100
million

01:47:06.870 --> 01:47:06.880 align:start position:0%
million
 
01:47:08.950 --> 01:47:08.960 align:start position:0%
that's your goal
 
01:47:11.270 --> 01:47:11.280 align:start position:0%
yes ma'am i think the ways and that's
 
01:47:13.270 --> 01:47:13.280 align:start position:0%
trying to reach where where
 
01:47:15.270 --> 01:47:15.280 align:start position:0%
where you're going so that means it's
 
01:47:18.550 --> 01:47:18.560 align:start position:0%
about 59 million
 
01:47:18.560 --> 01:47:20.629 align:start position:0%
about 59 million
that

01:47:20.629 --> 01:47:20.639 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:47:23.030 --> 01:47:23.040 align:start position:0%
is reduced
 
01:47:23.040 --> 01:47:24.149 align:start position:0%
is reduced
no

01:47:24.149 --> 01:47:24.159 align:start position:0%
no
 
01:47:25.350 --> 01:47:25.360 align:start position:0%
if you add that
 
01:47:28.310 --> 01:47:28.320 align:start position:0%
no no that 59 million is is an
 
01:47:31.430 --> 01:47:31.440 align:start position:0%
irrelevant useless number to us
 
01:47:34.310 --> 01:47:34.320 align:start position:0%
we we have a process where we must use
 
01:47:36.709 --> 01:47:36.719 align:start position:0%
the ways and means revenue estimate
 
01:47:38.950 --> 01:47:38.960 align:start position:0%
the ways and means revenue estimate
 
01:47:41.669 --> 01:47:41.679 align:start position:0%
gives us a delta
 
01:47:44.870 --> 01:47:44.880 align:start position:0%
between the ways and means estimate as
 
01:47:47.590 --> 01:47:47.600 align:start position:0%
is voted on by the new hampshire house
 
01:47:50.709 --> 01:47:50.719 align:start position:0%
between that revenue estimate and the
 
01:47:52.070 --> 01:47:52.080 align:start position:0%
money's being
 
01:47:54.790 --> 01:47:54.800 align:start position:0%
spent in the fy21 budget
 
01:47:57.350 --> 01:47:57.360 align:start position:0%
what we are doing is we're using our own
 
01:47:59.910 --> 01:47:59.920 align:start position:0%
independent process to build from an
 
01:48:03.750 --> 01:48:03.760 align:start position:0%
fy21 base to allocate the funds that are
 
01:48:05.750 --> 01:48:05.760 align:start position:0%
available as a result of the ways and
 
01:48:07.990 --> 01:48:08.000 align:start position:0%
means revenue estimate
 
01:48:10.950 --> 01:48:10.960 align:start position:0%
it's it's parallel but it's completely
 
01:48:12.790 --> 01:48:12.800 align:start position:0%
separate from
 
01:48:14.149 --> 01:48:14.159 align:start position:0%
the governor's
 
01:48:14.159 --> 01:48:16.390 align:start position:0%
the governor's
process

01:48:16.390 --> 01:48:16.400 align:start position:0%
process
 
01:48:22.149 --> 01:48:22.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:24.229 --> 01:48:24.239 align:start position:0%
well i'm just trying to get to i'm i'm
 
01:48:27.109 --> 01:48:27.119 align:start position:0%
just trying to get a simple number
 
01:48:29.030 --> 01:48:29.040 align:start position:0%
of i'm just trying to get to a point
 
01:48:29.040 --> 01:48:30.470 align:start position:0%
of i'm just trying to get to a point
where

01:48:30.470 --> 01:48:30.480 align:start position:0%
where
 
01:48:33.270 --> 01:48:33.280 align:start position:0%
i understand how much either you're
 
01:48:36.229 --> 01:48:36.239 align:start position:0%
adding back and it looked like it looked
 
01:48:40.149 --> 01:48:40.159 align:start position:0%
like you were 159 million
 
01:48:40.159 --> 01:48:41.590 align:start position:0%
like you were 159 million
under

01:48:41.590 --> 01:48:41.600 align:start position:0%
under
 
01:48:43.830 --> 01:48:43.840 align:start position:0%
the governor's budget
 
01:48:48.790 --> 01:48:48.800 align:start position:0%
the governor estimated 159 million over
 
01:48:51.830 --> 01:48:51.840 align:start position:0%
the fy 21 base that's what 159
 
01:48:53.750 --> 01:48:53.760 align:start position:0%
represents and from your base you're
 
01:48:55.990 --> 01:48:56.000 align:start position:0%
trying to add back
 
01:48:57.750 --> 01:48:57.760 align:start position:0%
100 million
 
01:48:59.510 --> 01:48:59.520 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to stay within the ways and
 
01:49:02.149 --> 01:49:02.159 align:start position:0%
means revenue estimate and that allows
 
01:49:05.270 --> 01:49:05.280 align:start position:0%
us 100 million at this point right okay
 
01:49:06.790 --> 01:49:06.800 align:start position:0%
we're on the same we're on the same
 
01:49:06.800 --> 01:49:07.750 align:start position:0%
we're on the same we're on the same
track

01:49:07.750 --> 01:49:07.760 align:start position:0%
track
 
01:49:10.070 --> 01:49:10.080 align:start position:0%
every single one of us wants the ways
 
01:49:12.470 --> 01:49:12.480 align:start position:0%
and means estimate on friday to be
 
01:49:14.550 --> 01:49:14.560 align:start position:0%
greater so that there's more than 100
 
01:49:14.560 --> 01:49:15.910 align:start position:0%
greater so that there's more than 100
million

01:49:15.910 --> 01:49:15.920 align:start position:0%
million
 
01:49:17.830 --> 01:49:17.840 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
01:49:20.550 --> 01:49:20.560 align:start position:0%
there's 59 million
 
01:49:22.950 --> 01:49:22.960 align:start position:0%
as of today using the ways and means
 
01:49:22.960 --> 01:49:24.390 align:start position:0%
as of today using the ways and means
estimates

01:49:24.390 --> 01:49:24.400 align:start position:0%
estimates
 
01:49:27.750 --> 01:49:27.760 align:start position:0%
doing 100 there's 59 million
 
01:49:30.870 --> 01:49:30.880 align:start position:0%
that's still out there
 
01:49:33.109 --> 01:49:33.119 align:start position:0%
that the governor's budget
 
01:49:35.669 --> 01:49:35.679 align:start position:0%
is higher
 
01:49:37.589 --> 01:49:37.599 align:start position:0%
than if we if we did add back the
 
01:49:37.599 --> 01:49:39.270 align:start position:0%
than if we if we did add back the
hundred

01:49:39.270 --> 01:49:39.280 align:start position:0%
hundred
 
01:49:41.189 --> 01:49:41.199 align:start position:0%
i would i would say it differently as
 
01:49:43.589 --> 01:49:43.599 align:start position:0%
you wouldn't be surprised i would say
 
01:49:43.599 --> 01:49:45.350 align:start position:0%
you wouldn't be surprised i would say
that

01:49:45.350 --> 01:49:45.360 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:49:47.430 --> 01:49:47.440 align:start position:0%
the revenue estimation
 
01:49:47.440 --> 01:49:48.870 align:start position:0%
the revenue estimation
techniques

01:49:48.870 --> 01:49:48.880 align:start position:0%
techniques
 
01:49:51.830 --> 01:49:51.840 align:start position:0%
used by others and not us
 
01:49:53.750 --> 01:49:53.760 align:start position:0%
the governor's revenue estimation
 
01:49:55.910 --> 01:49:55.920 align:start position:0%
technique and the ways and means revenue
 
01:49:58.229 --> 01:49:58.239 align:start position:0%
estimation technique
 
01:50:00.790 --> 01:50:00.800 align:start position:0%
disagree with each other and
 
01:50:04.790 --> 01:50:04.800 align:start position:0%
to the tune of about 59 million dollars
 
01:50:05.750 --> 01:50:05.760 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:50:08.470 --> 01:50:08.480 align:start position:0%
and and that we have no control over
 
01:50:11.189 --> 01:50:11.199 align:start position:0%
that we we are downstream
 
01:50:12.790 --> 01:50:12.800 align:start position:0%
from the people who do the revenue
 
01:50:15.750 --> 01:50:15.760 align:start position:0%
estimate and so we we can only
 
01:50:18.310 --> 01:50:18.320 align:start position:0%
spend what we've got and what we've got
 
01:50:18.320 --> 01:50:19.189 align:start position:0%
spend what we've got and what we've got
is

01:50:19.189 --> 01:50:19.199 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:50:23.270 --> 01:50:23.280 align:start position:0%
about 100 million over the fy21 base and
 
01:50:25.270 --> 01:50:25.280 align:start position:0%
right yeah
 
01:50:27.109 --> 01:50:27.119 align:start position:0%
i i think we're on the same i think
 
01:50:30.070 --> 01:50:30.080 align:start position:0%
we're at the same place so if
 
01:50:32.229 --> 01:50:32.239 align:start position:0%
just as an example ways and means came
 
01:50:33.830 --> 01:50:33.840 align:start position:0%
in on friday
 
01:50:37.109 --> 01:50:37.119 align:start position:0%
and had an additional 10 million dollars
 
01:50:39.990 --> 01:50:40.000 align:start position:0%
yeah then we would
 
01:50:45.350 --> 01:50:45.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:47.830 --> 01:50:47.840 align:start position:0%
again the 49 million would be irrelevant
 
01:50:49.750 --> 01:50:49.760 align:start position:0%
we would have an additional 10 million
 
01:50:52.870 --> 01:50:52.880 align:start position:0%
to put on to the fy 21 base
 
01:51:00.390 --> 01:51:00.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:01.669 --> 01:51:01.679 align:start position:0%
so you'll note
 
01:51:04.229 --> 01:51:04.239 align:start position:0%
that i'm fastidiously avoiding
 
01:51:05.669 --> 01:51:05.679 align:start position:0%
the term cut
 
01:51:07.830 --> 01:51:07.840 align:start position:0%
because we're not cutting anything
 
01:51:10.550 --> 01:51:10.560 align:start position:0%
we we are adding we're using our
 
01:51:13.270 --> 01:51:13.280 align:start position:0%
legislatively approved process to add
 
01:51:16.229 --> 01:51:16.239 align:start position:0%
money back we're not cutting anything
 
01:51:19.669 --> 01:51:19.679 align:start position:0%
so um that's my position i'm sticking to
 
01:51:19.679 --> 01:51:20.950 align:start position:0%
so um that's my position i'm sticking to
it

01:51:20.950 --> 01:51:20.960 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:51:22.790 --> 01:51:22.800 align:start position:0%
so representative waller do you do you
 
01:51:24.390 --> 01:51:24.400 align:start position:0%
want no
 
01:51:26.070 --> 01:51:26.080 align:start position:0%
that's fine i
 
01:51:27.830 --> 01:51:27.840 align:start position:0%
just think it's
 
01:51:30.390 --> 01:51:30.400 align:start position:0%
sometimes amusing okay thank you
 
01:51:33.589 --> 01:51:33.599 align:start position:0%
i i try sometimes to be amusing i i hope
 
01:51:36.310 --> 01:51:36.320 align:start position:0%
we're in sync
 
01:51:36.320 --> 01:51:37.189 align:start position:0%
we're in sync
so

01:51:37.189 --> 01:51:37.199 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:51:39.109 --> 01:51:39.119 align:start position:0%
um okay
 
01:51:41.830 --> 01:51:41.840 align:start position:0%
so where were we when we we last looked
 
01:51:43.830 --> 01:51:43.840 align:start position:0%
at chip
 
01:51:46.550 --> 01:51:46.560 align:start position:0%
if we went with the governor's numbers
 
01:51:50.790 --> 01:51:50.800 align:start position:0%
we would have consumed about 78 million
 
01:51:53.350 --> 01:51:53.360 align:start position:0%
of the 100 million that ways and means
 
01:51:55.030 --> 01:51:55.040 align:start position:0%
said we had
 
01:51:58.229 --> 01:51:58.239 align:start position:0%
so so we got another 22 million
 
01:52:00.310 --> 01:52:00.320 align:start position:0%
that we could potentially add back on
 
01:52:02.550 --> 01:52:02.560 align:start position:0%
other lines
 
01:52:04.470 --> 01:52:04.480 align:start position:0%
are there are there any comments or
 
01:52:06.229 --> 01:52:06.239 align:start position:0%
questions about where we are because
 
01:52:08.390 --> 01:52:08.400 align:start position:0%
because i think we're about to go look
 
01:52:13.270 --> 01:52:13.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:15.910 --> 01:52:15.920 align:start position:0%
okay so i i would like us all to be
 
01:52:17.270 --> 01:52:17.280 align:start position:0%
thinking through
 
01:52:19.910 --> 01:52:19.920 align:start position:0%
the possibility that we're division
 
01:52:23.589 --> 01:52:23.599 align:start position:0%
three's recommendation for line 7051
 
01:52:28.070 --> 01:52:28.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:30.149 --> 01:52:30.159 align:start position:0%
representative walnut your hand is up is
 
01:52:31.990 --> 01:52:32.000 align:start position:0%
that a
 
01:52:33.669 --> 01:52:33.679 align:start position:0%
do you have another question
 
01:52:36.310 --> 01:52:36.320 align:start position:0%
yes i do i i wondered if karen was still
 
01:52:36.320 --> 01:52:37.750 align:start position:0%
yes i do i i wondered if karen was still
on

01:52:37.750 --> 01:52:37.760 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:52:40.070 --> 01:52:40.080 align:start position:0%
i mean i know that there is medicaid in
 
01:52:42.950 --> 01:52:42.960 align:start position:0%
a number of other spots in this budget
 
01:52:45.830 --> 01:52:45.840 align:start position:0%
and how does accepting
 
01:52:49.510 --> 01:52:49.520 align:start position:0%
some lines without other lines
 
01:52:52.310 --> 01:52:52.320 align:start position:0%
affect all of that
 
01:52:54.550 --> 01:52:54.560 align:start position:0%
have we hit all of the uh
 
01:52:56.709 --> 01:52:56.719 align:start position:0%
medicaid lines in the budget
 
01:53:00.470 --> 01:53:00.480 align:start position:0%
so the other large medicaid
 
01:53:04.149 --> 01:53:04.159 align:start position:0%
provider type payments are in
 
01:53:04.159 --> 01:53:05.510 align:start position:0%
provider type payments are in
um

01:53:05.510 --> 01:53:05.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:53:07.270 --> 01:53:07.280 align:start position:0%
developmental disabilities and long-term
 
01:53:09.990 --> 01:53:10.000 align:start position:0%
supports and services and
 
01:53:11.750 --> 01:53:11.760 align:start position:0%
uh well actually it's all in long-term
 
01:53:13.750 --> 01:53:13.760 align:start position:0%
supports and services it's long-term
 
01:53:17.189 --> 01:53:17.199 align:start position:0%
care which is mostly a county match
 
01:53:20.470 --> 01:53:20.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:23.990 --> 01:53:24.000 align:start position:0%
the developmental disabilities accounts
 
01:53:25.910 --> 01:53:25.920 align:start position:0%
so so let's um
 
01:53:28.709 --> 01:53:28.719 align:start position:0%
let's let's let's react here on the fly
 
01:53:31.270 --> 01:53:31.280 align:start position:0%
i get uh miss ripple if you would just
 
01:53:33.109 --> 01:53:33.119 align:start position:0%
think about how you would get us to the
 
01:53:33.119 --> 01:53:34.390 align:start position:0%
think about how you would get us to the
development

01:53:34.390 --> 01:53:34.400 align:start position:0%
development
 
01:53:37.189 --> 01:53:37.199 align:start position:0%
disabilities uh line
 
01:53:38.950 --> 01:53:38.960 align:start position:0%
representative wallner your hand is
 
01:53:41.669 --> 01:53:41.679 align:start position:0%
still up is that a follow-up no i no i
 
01:53:43.510 --> 01:53:43.520 align:start position:0%
just wanted to i just want to be sure
 
01:53:46.149 --> 01:53:46.159 align:start position:0%
we've seen all of the medicaid lines
 
01:53:48.229 --> 01:53:48.239 align:start position:0%
i think that's a great question and i i
 
01:53:50.229 --> 01:53:50.239 align:start position:0%
share your concern and i appreciate miss
 
01:53:51.750 --> 01:53:51.760 align:start position:0%
round's answer
 
01:53:54.390 --> 01:53:54.400 align:start position:0%
um and and i will adapt to it
 
01:53:57.510 --> 01:53:57.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:00.070 --> 01:54:00.080 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair i would like to ask
 
01:54:01.350 --> 01:54:01.360 align:start position:0%
the surrounds
 
01:54:05.030 --> 01:54:05.040 align:start position:0%
on the a m uh report it's they
 
01:54:07.030 --> 01:54:07.040 align:start position:0%
pointed out how
 
01:54:07.040 --> 01:54:08.070 align:start position:0%
pointed out how
the

01:54:08.070 --> 01:54:08.080 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:54:11.109 --> 01:54:11.119 align:start position:0%
hhs was not achieving the maximum amount
 
01:54:13.830 --> 01:54:13.840 align:start position:0%
of medicaid because of the way you filed
 
01:54:15.990 --> 01:54:16.000 align:start position:0%
has there been any changes in the way
 
01:54:18.790 --> 01:54:18.800 align:start position:0%
you file and what are they reflected in
 
01:54:21.030 --> 01:54:21.040 align:start position:0%
the 2223
 
01:54:21.040 --> 01:54:24.070 align:start position:0%
the 2223
budget

01:54:24.070 --> 01:54:24.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:26.629 --> 01:54:26.639 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure if i know
 
01:54:29.109 --> 01:54:29.119 align:start position:0%
exactly which finding you're referring
 
01:54:31.830 --> 01:54:31.840 align:start position:0%
to there there is a finding about 4e
 
01:54:36.629 --> 01:54:36.639 align:start position:0%
that we're not claiming enough for e um
 
01:54:38.709 --> 01:54:38.719 align:start position:0%
that is not fully reflected in the
 
01:54:40.470 --> 01:54:40.480 align:start position:0%
budget because we have not been able to
 
01:54:42.149 --> 01:54:42.159 align:start position:0%
implement all of the changes that need
 
01:54:44.629 --> 01:54:44.639 align:start position:0%
to happen to do that
 
01:54:44.639 --> 01:54:46.870 align:start position:0%
to happen to do that
um

01:54:46.870 --> 01:54:46.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:54:49.589 --> 01:54:49.599 align:start position:0%
there was also some discussion about i
 
01:54:50.870 --> 01:54:50.880 align:start position:0%
think the
 
01:54:53.270 --> 01:54:53.280 align:start position:0%
medicaid reports that we file and having
 
01:54:55.589 --> 01:54:55.599 align:start position:0%
some technology difficulties related to
 
01:55:00.070 --> 01:55:00.080 align:start position:0%
mmis and again the the funds to
 
01:55:03.350 --> 01:55:03.360 align:start position:0%
upgrade mmis are in the capital budget
 
01:55:05.510 --> 01:55:05.520 align:start position:0%
um so that would probably likely be
 
01:55:09.589 --> 01:55:09.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:11.910 --> 01:55:11.920 align:start position:0%
thank you is there a plan to adopt some
 
01:55:13.830 --> 01:55:13.840 align:start position:0%
of their recommendations
 
01:55:18.149 --> 01:55:18.159 align:start position:0%
yes yes and um i know that the hb2 part
 
01:55:21.510 --> 01:55:21.520 align:start position:0%
of that is coming up on friday and i
 
01:55:25.270 --> 01:55:25.280 align:start position:0%
will have folks from a m available to uh
 
01:55:27.589 --> 01:55:27.599 align:start position:0%
speak to their findings as well
 
01:55:27.599 --> 01:55:28.390 align:start position:0%
speak to their findings as well
um

01:55:28.390 --> 01:55:28.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:55:30.950 --> 01:55:30.960 align:start position:0%
but we are planning on implementing i
 
01:55:34.149 --> 01:55:34.159 align:start position:0%
believe um
 
01:55:36.870 --> 01:55:36.880 align:start position:0%
almost all of them and and really all of
 
01:55:40.470 --> 01:55:40.480 align:start position:0%
them in time uh there's a couple that uh
 
01:55:43.430 --> 01:55:43.440 align:start position:0%
you can't take on simultaneously so it
 
01:55:45.990 --> 01:55:46.000 align:start position:0%
will come later in the process hopefully
 
01:55:48.629 --> 01:55:48.639 align:start position:0%
but there's four or five six that were
 
01:55:51.589 --> 01:55:51.599 align:start position:0%
that we're starting work on right now
 
01:55:55.990 --> 01:55:56.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:59.030 --> 01:55:59.040 align:start position:0%
okay uh i'm not seeing any other hands
 
01:56:00.470 --> 01:56:00.480 align:start position:0%
up um
 
01:56:01.830 --> 01:56:01.840 align:start position:0%
let's let's
 
01:56:05.350 --> 01:56:05.360 align:start position:0%
if you're ready to take us to the uh
 
01:56:07.350 --> 01:56:07.360 align:start position:0%
the activity code for the
 
01:56:09.830 --> 01:56:09.840 align:start position:0%
developmentally disabled
 
01:56:11.270 --> 01:56:11.280 align:start position:0%
yeah karen do you have that accounting
 
01:56:12.709 --> 01:56:12.719 align:start position:0%
unit off the top of your head because i
 
01:56:17.830 --> 01:56:17.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:19.910 --> 01:56:19.920 align:start position:0%
let's take a let's take a five minute
 
01:56:22.470 --> 01:56:22.480 align:start position:0%
bio break here and and we'll come back
 
01:56:24.870 --> 01:56:24.880 align:start position:0%
and we'll we'll go to developmentally
 
01:56:26.790 --> 01:56:26.800 align:start position:0%
disabled and then we'll go to long-term
 
01:56:29.109 --> 01:56:29.119 align:start position:0%
care supports and then we'll try to hit
 
01:56:29.119 --> 01:56:30.149 align:start position:0%
care supports and then we'll try to hit
tanf

01:56:30.149 --> 01:56:30.159 align:start position:0%
tanf
 
01:56:36.390 --> 01:56:36.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:40.950 --> 01:56:40.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:43.109 --> 01:56:43.119 align:start position:0%
appendix a that's probably the easiest
 
01:56:44.790 --> 01:56:44.800 align:start position:0%
thing to work from
 
01:56:44.800 --> 01:57:02.149 align:start position:0%
thing to work from
okay

01:57:02.149 --> 01:57:02.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:04.950 --> 01:57:04.960 align:start position:0%
do you want me to resend it over to you
 
01:57:07.910 --> 01:57:07.920 align:start position:0%
if you don't mind no i don't mind
 
01:57:07.920 --> 01:57:19.670 align:start position:0%
if you don't mind no i don't mind
oops

01:57:19.670 --> 01:57:19.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:19.680 --> 01:57:21.910 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

01:57:21.910 --> 01:57:21.920 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:57:23.270 --> 01:57:23.280 align:start position:0%
and that is a little easier because it
 
01:57:44.629 --> 01:57:44.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:44.639 --> 01:57:56.229 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:57:56.229 --> 01:57:56.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:56.239 --> 01:57:56.950 align:start position:0%
 
it's

01:57:56.950 --> 01:57:56.960 align:start position:0%
it's
 
01:57:59.910 --> 01:57:59.920 align:start position:0%
agency 93
 
01:58:01.830 --> 01:58:01.840 align:start position:0%
so long-term supports and services is
 
01:58:05.270 --> 01:58:05.280 align:start position:0%
two different agencies so it starts
 
01:58:07.750 --> 01:58:07.760 align:start position:0%
on page 11 32.
 
01:58:09.750 --> 01:58:09.760 align:start position:0%
okay thank you you're welcome i'm just
 
01:58:09.760 --> 01:58:10.629 align:start position:0%
okay thank you you're welcome i'm just
going

01:58:10.629 --> 01:58:10.639 align:start position:0%
going
 
01:58:16.790 --> 01:58:16.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:18.229 --> 01:58:18.239 align:start position:0%
when you find a camera just let me know
 
01:58:19.430 --> 01:58:19.440 align:start position:0%
the account number
 
01:58:21.750 --> 01:58:21.760 align:start position:0%
yep sure
 
01:58:35.830 --> 01:58:35.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:44.310 --> 01:58:44.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:47.030 --> 01:58:47.040 align:start position:0%
professional care
 
01:58:50.149 --> 01:58:50.159 align:start position:0%
should be called developmental services
 
01:58:53.030 --> 01:58:53.040 align:start position:0%
oh no wrong stuff odd because i thought
 
01:59:00.070 --> 01:59:00.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:01.669 --> 01:59:01.679 align:start position:0%
okay got it do you happen to know what
 
01:59:03.750 --> 01:59:03.760 align:start position:0%
the other one is going to be the um
 
01:59:03.760 --> 01:59:05.350 align:start position:0%
the other one is going to be the um
long-term

01:59:05.350 --> 01:59:05.360 align:start position:0%
long-term
 
01:59:07.109 --> 01:59:07.119 align:start position:0%
care once you mentioned
 
01:59:07.119 --> 01:59:10.229 align:start position:0%
care once you mentioned
i

01:59:10.229 --> 01:59:10.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:12.709 --> 01:59:12.719 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure what that one would be okay
 
01:59:14.390 --> 01:59:14.400 align:start position:0%
okay we'll get there
 
01:59:17.750 --> 01:59:17.760 align:start position:0%
i know that
 
01:59:19.669 --> 01:59:19.679 align:start position:0%
so later we'll be looking at tanf and i
 
01:59:22.790 --> 01:59:22.800 align:start position:0%
know that's 6146.
 
01:59:24.070 --> 01:59:24.080 align:start position:0%
yeah attend if i can find you i can
 
01:59:28.550 --> 01:59:28.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:29.830 --> 01:59:29.840 align:start position:0%
it's when they make up these names that
 
01:59:31.350 --> 01:59:31.360 align:start position:0%
aren't in this spreadsheet i can't find
 
01:59:37.669 --> 01:59:37.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:40.390 --> 01:59:40.400 align:start position:0%
and just so you know it's page
 
01:59:44.790 --> 01:59:44.800 align:start position:0%
10 has the oh no that's not it either
 
01:59:44.800 --> 01:59:47.189 align:start position:0%
10 has the oh no that's not it either
700.

01:59:47.189 --> 01:59:47.199 align:start position:0%
700.
 
01:59:48.950 --> 01:59:48.960 align:start position:0%
i still gotta find out that's there's
 
01:59:51.109 --> 01:59:51.119 align:start position:0%
two there's too many 7100s
 
01:59:55.030 --> 01:59:55.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:00.550 --> 02:00:00.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:02.470 --> 02:00:02.480 align:start position:0%
i think that's kind of where he's
 
02:00:08.709 --> 02:00:08.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:11.189 --> 02:00:11.199 align:start position:0%
page 64 if we get to that point
 
02:00:27.669 --> 02:00:27.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:29.990 --> 02:00:30.000 align:start position:0%
so i'm i'm personally ready to get going
 
02:00:32.149 --> 02:00:32.159 align:start position:0%
again um
 
02:00:37.430 --> 02:00:37.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:39.350 --> 02:00:39.360 align:start position:0%
i'm here i think karen was just taking a
 
02:00:41.910 --> 02:00:41.920 align:start position:0%
quick break she'll be right back
 
02:00:45.350 --> 02:00:45.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:46.950 --> 02:00:46.960 align:start position:0%
it's not that she couldn't catch up
 
02:00:48.310 --> 02:00:48.320 align:start position:0%
quickly i just
 
02:00:52.070 --> 02:00:52.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:53.350 --> 02:00:53.360 align:start position:0%
you want to go ahead and share your
 
02:00:56.149 --> 02:00:56.159 align:start position:0%
document them though on the
 
02:00:56.159 --> 02:01:17.109 align:start position:0%
document them though on the
shore

02:01:17.109 --> 02:01:17.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:19.350 --> 02:01:19.360 align:start position:0%
hey keith
 
02:01:20.470 --> 02:01:20.480 align:start position:0%
yes sir
 
02:01:24.229 --> 02:01:24.239 align:start position:0%
um on your on your worksheet
 
02:01:27.189 --> 02:01:27.199 align:start position:0%
would you just tell me
 
02:01:29.350 --> 02:01:29.360 align:start position:0%
which of the numbers you put into your
 
02:01:31.910 --> 02:01:31.920 align:start position:0%
worksheet did you put in
 
02:01:33.270 --> 02:01:33.280 align:start position:0%
the 1
 
02:01:36.790 --> 02:01:36.800 align:start position:0%
64 5 number from the adjusted authorized
 
02:01:42.229 --> 02:01:42.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:43.750 --> 02:01:43.760 align:start position:0%
i put in the
 
02:01:43.760 --> 02:01:45.350 align:start position:0%
i put in the
160.1

02:01:45.350 --> 02:01:45.360 align:start position:0%
160.1
 
02:01:48.310 --> 02:01:48.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:49.750 --> 02:01:49.760 align:start position:0%
since that's a lower number than the
 
02:01:49.760 --> 02:01:51.350 align:start position:0%
since that's a lower number than the
164.

02:01:51.350 --> 02:01:51.360 align:start position:0%
164.
 
02:01:53.990 --> 02:01:54.000 align:start position:0%
and i just at this point
 
02:01:57.990 --> 02:01:58.000 align:start position:0%
23 was the same as 22.
 
02:01:59.189 --> 02:01:59.199 align:start position:0%
so the only difference here in other
 
02:02:01.910 --> 02:02:01.920 align:start position:0%
words is would be the 15 million
 
02:02:01.920 --> 02:02:02.830 align:start position:0%
words is would be the 15 million
and

02:02:02.830 --> 02:02:02.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:02:02.840 --> 02:02:04.629 align:start position:0%
and
23.

02:02:04.629 --> 02:02:04.639 align:start position:0%
23.
 
02:02:06.310 --> 02:02:06.320 align:start position:0%
does that make sense
 
02:02:20.070 --> 02:02:20.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:22.950 --> 02:02:22.960 align:start position:0%
do we have an enhanced f map for that
 
02:02:22.960 --> 02:02:27.750 align:start position:0%
do we have an enhanced f map for that
23.

02:02:27.750 --> 02:02:27.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:29.910 --> 02:02:29.920 align:start position:0%
i don't think there would be enhanced f
 
02:02:33.189 --> 02:02:33.199 align:start position:0%
map in 23 and if i heard ms rounds right
 
02:02:35.910 --> 02:02:35.920 align:start position:0%
we're not assuming any enhanced f map in
 
02:02:39.270 --> 02:02:39.280 align:start position:0%
22 even even though we may get it and it
 
02:02:41.350 --> 02:02:41.360 align:start position:0%
might look like a windfall when it
 
02:02:43.430 --> 02:02:43.440 align:start position:0%
happens she didn't use the term windfall
 
02:02:43.440 --> 02:02:44.950 align:start position:0%
happens she didn't use the term windfall
though

02:02:44.950 --> 02:02:44.960 align:start position:0%
though
 
02:02:46.629 --> 02:02:46.639 align:start position:0%
she did assume it in
 
02:02:48.470 --> 02:02:48.480 align:start position:0%
the large the very with a really large
 
02:02:51.589 --> 02:02:51.599 align:start position:0%
medicaid account because that one
 
02:02:54.629 --> 02:02:54.639 align:start position:0%
they are allowing he's back now hi hi
 
02:02:57.589 --> 02:02:57.599 align:start position:0%
miss rounds hello
 
02:03:00.070 --> 02:03:00.080 align:start position:0%
i think uh representative weiler just
 
02:03:03.910 --> 02:03:03.920 align:start position:0%
wants to sync up on you with you on on
 
02:03:07.270 --> 02:03:07.280 align:start position:0%
enhanced fmap and how it affects the
 
02:03:10.390 --> 02:03:10.400 align:start position:0%
planning assumptions for 22 and 23.
 
02:03:10.400 --> 02:03:11.430 align:start position:0%
planning assumptions for 22 and 23.
okay

02:03:11.430 --> 02:03:11.440 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:03:13.589 --> 02:03:13.599 align:start position:0%
um so
 
02:03:15.270 --> 02:03:15.280 align:start position:0%
the only
 
02:03:16.870 --> 02:03:16.880 align:start position:0%
accounting unit that we made an
 
02:03:20.229 --> 02:03:20.239 align:start position:0%
adjustment for the enhanced fmap for 22
 
02:03:23.510 --> 02:03:23.520 align:start position:0%
only uh was 79.48
 
02:03:25.830 --> 02:03:25.840 align:start position:0%
we are hearing that the enhanced fmap is
 
02:03:29.189 --> 02:03:29.199 align:start position:0%
likely to go through until december 31st
 
02:03:31.430 --> 02:03:31.440 align:start position:0%
it is dependent on
 
02:03:33.830 --> 02:03:33.840 align:start position:0%
when the public health emergency ends at
 
02:03:35.430 --> 02:03:35.440 align:start position:0%
the federal level
 
02:03:38.070 --> 02:03:38.080 align:start position:0%
so uh we have received indications that
 
02:03:39.510 --> 02:03:39.520 align:start position:0%
it will continue through the end of the
 
02:03:41.270 --> 02:03:41.280 align:start position:0%
calendar year so we made the adjustment
 
02:03:43.030 --> 02:03:43.040 align:start position:0%
in 79.48
 
02:03:44.790 --> 02:03:44.800 align:start position:0%
we have not made it anywhere else
 
02:03:47.910 --> 02:03:47.920 align:start position:0%
including this accounting unit
 
02:03:50.550 --> 02:03:50.560 align:start position:0%
so if we get okay i want i just want to
 
02:03:52.709 --> 02:03:52.719 align:start position:0%
make sure again i'm understanding what
 
02:03:54.870 --> 02:03:54.880 align:start position:0%
you're telling us i i think
 
02:03:57.589 --> 02:03:57.599 align:start position:0%
what we're saying is that for
 
02:03:57.599 --> 02:03:58.629 align:start position:0%
what we're saying is that for
line

02:03:58.629 --> 02:03:58.639 align:start position:0%
line
 
02:03:58.639 --> 02:04:00.390 align:start position:0%
line
um

02:04:00.390 --> 02:04:00.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:04:02.709 --> 02:04:02.719 align:start position:0%
seven one zero zero
 
02:04:02.719 --> 02:04:03.470 align:start position:0%
seven one zero zero
the

02:04:03.470 --> 02:04:03.480 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:04:07.510 --> 02:04:07.520 align:start position:0%
160.1 million that's in fy22
 
02:04:10.310 --> 02:04:10.320 align:start position:0%
assumes a traditional match it does not
 
02:04:12.790 --> 02:04:12.800 align:start position:0%
assume the enhanced depth map
 
02:04:13.990 --> 02:04:14.000 align:start position:0%
but that if
 
02:04:16.790 --> 02:04:16.800 align:start position:0%
but that if we get the enhanced f map
 
02:04:18.229 --> 02:04:18.239 align:start position:0%
it would it would look and i'm going to
 
02:04:20.950 --> 02:04:20.960 align:start position:0%
use the word windfall a lot of budget
 
02:04:23.109 --> 02:04:23.119 align:start position:0%
people don't like the term but i i think
 
02:04:25.189 --> 02:04:25.199 align:start position:0%
i think it's going to be
 
02:04:27.109 --> 02:04:27.119 align:start position:0%
surplus money that we didn't count on
 
02:04:30.310 --> 02:04:30.320 align:start position:0%
and therefore it looks like a windfall
 
02:04:32.229 --> 02:04:32.239 align:start position:0%
and it's also possible that we're going
 
02:04:35.189 --> 02:04:35.199 align:start position:0%
to get more guidance from the feds
 
02:04:36.629 --> 02:04:36.639 align:start position:0%
between now
 
02:04:36.639 --> 02:04:37.589 align:start position:0%
between now
and

02:04:37.589 --> 02:04:37.599 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:04:39.750 --> 02:04:39.760 align:start position:0%
say the committee at conference
 
02:04:42.069 --> 02:04:42.079 align:start position:0%
and so before the final budget gets
 
02:04:43.109 --> 02:04:43.119 align:start position:0%
locked in
 
02:04:44.950 --> 02:04:44.960 align:start position:0%
maybe we'll have a different better
 
02:04:47.990 --> 02:04:48.000 align:start position:0%
grounded estimate for this account yes
 
02:04:49.350 --> 02:04:49.360 align:start position:0%
we would definitely
 
02:04:51.270 --> 02:04:51.280 align:start position:0%
try to make any adjustments we can
 
02:04:53.750 --> 02:04:53.760 align:start position:0%
before committing a conference um based
 
02:04:56.149 --> 02:04:56.159 align:start position:0%
on the guidance at that time
 
02:04:57.910 --> 02:04:57.920 align:start position:0%
but so for now we're assuming no
 
02:04:59.910 --> 02:04:59.920 align:start position:0%
enhanced map
 
02:04:59.920 --> 02:05:01.589 align:start position:0%
enhanced map
correct

02:05:01.589 --> 02:05:01.599 align:start position:0%
correct
 
02:05:03.350 --> 02:05:03.360 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
02:05:04.830 --> 02:05:04.840 align:start position:0%
uh for the
 
02:05:07.990 --> 02:05:08.000 align:start position:0%
developmental developmentally disabled
 
02:05:08.000 --> 02:05:10.229 align:start position:0%
developmental developmentally disabled
services

02:05:10.229 --> 02:05:10.239 align:start position:0%
services
 
02:05:13.589 --> 02:05:13.599 align:start position:0%
i would like on line 7100
 
02:05:14.550 --> 02:05:14.560 align:start position:0%
i would
 
02:05:16.550 --> 02:05:16.560 align:start position:0%
like us to discuss
 
02:05:18.790 --> 02:05:18.800 align:start position:0%
the idea that we should accept the
 
02:05:21.030 --> 02:05:21.040 align:start position:0%
governor's recommended budget
 
02:05:23.750 --> 02:05:23.760 align:start position:0%
and and to get to that conversation why
 
02:05:25.350 --> 02:05:25.360 align:start position:0%
don't we start out
 
02:05:28.149 --> 02:05:28.159 align:start position:0%
uh mr ripple or ms ms rounds off either
 
02:05:29.109 --> 02:05:29.119 align:start position:0%
of you
 
02:05:32.390 --> 02:05:32.400 align:start position:0%
on explaining the difference between
 
02:05:35.950 --> 02:05:35.960 align:start position:0%
uh the fy 21 one
 
02:05:35.960 --> 02:05:37.510 align:start position:0%
uh the fy 21 one
64.5

02:05:37.510 --> 02:05:37.520 align:start position:0%
64.5
 
02:05:40.470 --> 02:05:40.480 align:start position:0%
and the 160.1 because it goes down in
 
02:05:43.669 --> 02:05:43.679 align:start position:0%
the first year of the governor's budget
 
02:05:46.830 --> 02:05:46.840 align:start position:0%
sure i can i can do that uh
 
02:05:50.069 --> 02:05:50.079 align:start position:0%
the this accounting unit was established
 
02:05:53.669 --> 02:05:53.679 align:start position:0%
to be a revolving account um in
 
02:05:57.270 --> 02:05:57.280 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 2021. um this to the
 
02:05:58.870 --> 02:05:58.880 align:start position:0%
discussion earlier with representative
 
02:06:00.629 --> 02:06:00.639 align:start position:0%
irf doesn't show revolving funds because
 
02:06:03.589 --> 02:06:03.599 align:start position:0%
it is funded with the general fund
 
02:06:06.390 --> 02:06:06.400 align:start position:0%
and with the federal match
 
02:06:08.390 --> 02:06:08.400 align:start position:0%
because of it now being a revolving
 
02:06:10.790 --> 02:06:10.800 align:start position:0%
account the fiscal year
 
02:06:13.510 --> 02:06:13.520 align:start position:0%
22 budget
 
02:06:16.709 --> 02:06:16.719 align:start position:0%
has been requested assuming that we will
 
02:06:19.189 --> 02:06:19.199 align:start position:0%
have about a 38 million dollar carry
 
02:06:19.199 --> 02:06:20.149 align:start position:0%
have about a 38 million dollar carry
forward

02:06:20.149 --> 02:06:20.159 align:start position:0%
forward
 
02:06:24.870 --> 02:06:24.880 align:start position:0%
uh in total funds from 21 into 22.
 
02:06:26.709 --> 02:06:26.719 align:start position:0%
so the reality is that budget is
 
02:06:26.719 --> 02:06:27.830 align:start position:0%
so the reality is that budget is
actually

02:06:27.830 --> 02:06:27.840 align:start position:0%
actually
 
02:06:27.840 --> 02:06:28.870 align:start position:0%
actually
um

02:06:28.870 --> 02:06:28.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:06:30.310 --> 02:06:30.320 align:start position:0%
you know what would be available in
 
02:06:33.390 --> 02:06:33.400 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 21 is more like
 
02:06:37.430 --> 02:06:37.440 align:start position:0%
350 million um and of course
 
02:06:39.990 --> 02:06:40.000 align:start position:0%
being anticipated it is anticipated that
 
02:06:41.430 --> 02:06:41.440 align:start position:0%
some of those funds would not get used
 
02:06:44.950 --> 02:06:44.960 align:start position:0%
in 22 and would carry forward to 23. um
 
02:06:46.629 --> 02:06:46.639 align:start position:0%
so that is why you're seeing a reduction
 
02:06:47.990 --> 02:06:48.000 align:start position:0%
there it's not
 
02:06:49.430 --> 02:06:49.440 align:start position:0%
actually a
 
02:06:51.990 --> 02:06:52.000 align:start position:0%
reduction in what's available to be
 
02:06:54.069 --> 02:06:54.079 align:start position:0%
spent but it is a reduction in what is
 
02:06:57.830 --> 02:06:57.840 align:start position:0%
being requested for general funds in 22.
 
02:07:00.709 --> 02:07:00.719 align:start position:0%
so do you do you know if the department
 
02:07:00.719 --> 02:07:02.229 align:start position:0%
so do you do you know if the department
uh

02:07:02.229 --> 02:07:02.239 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:07:03.750 --> 02:07:03.760 align:start position:0%
i mean obviously they work for the
 
02:07:06.550 --> 02:07:06.560 align:start position:0%
governor but uh the does does the
 
02:07:08.950 --> 02:07:08.960 align:start position:0%
department agree on the three lines that
 
02:07:11.350 --> 02:07:11.360 align:start position:0%
we've discussed so far with the
 
02:07:14.069 --> 02:07:14.079 align:start position:0%
governor's budget number
 
02:07:16.470 --> 02:07:16.480 align:start position:0%
so our request was a little bit higher
 
02:07:18.550 --> 02:07:18.560 align:start position:0%
than the governor's request than the
 
02:07:20.950 --> 02:07:20.960 align:start position:0%
governor's budget i'm sorry uh
 
02:07:23.030 --> 02:07:23.040 align:start position:0%
but we believe that the governor's
 
02:07:27.990 --> 02:07:28.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:28.000 --> 02:07:28.870 align:start position:0%
 
so

02:07:28.870 --> 02:07:28.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:07:32.229 --> 02:07:32.239 align:start position:0%
so are there questions or comments about
 
02:07:32.239 --> 02:07:33.270 align:start position:0%
so are there questions or comments about
uh

02:07:33.270 --> 02:07:33.280 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:07:36.390 --> 02:07:36.400 align:start position:0%
the 7100 line i i think
 
02:07:38.069 --> 02:07:38.079 align:start position:0%
if we were to accept the governor's
 
02:07:40.629 --> 02:07:40.639 align:start position:0%
budget what what that would mean in
 
02:07:42.550 --> 02:07:42.560 align:start position:0%
terms of
 
02:07:44.870 --> 02:07:44.880 align:start position:0%
our ability to use the ways and means
 
02:07:47.109 --> 02:07:47.119 align:start position:0%
estimate that would mean
 
02:07:47.119 --> 02:07:49.790 align:start position:0%
estimate that would mean
that

02:07:49.790 --> 02:07:49.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:49.800 --> 02:07:51.669 align:start position:0%
 
fy22

02:07:51.669 --> 02:07:51.679 align:start position:0%
fy22
 
02:07:53.589 --> 02:07:53.599 align:start position:0%
is what
 
02:07:57.589 --> 02:07:57.599 align:start position:0%
work document assumes fy23
 
02:07:59.669 --> 02:07:59.679 align:start position:0%
would add
 
02:08:01.589 --> 02:08:01.599 align:start position:0%
15 million
 
02:08:01.599 --> 02:08:02.550 align:start position:0%
15 million
so

02:08:02.550 --> 02:08:02.560 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:08:04.629 --> 02:08:04.639 align:start position:0%
if you take the 78
 
02:08:07.109 --> 02:08:07.119 align:start position:0%
plus the 15
 
02:08:08.550 --> 02:08:08.560 align:start position:0%
we're now
 
02:08:11.270 --> 02:08:11.280 align:start position:0%
uh at about 93 million
 
02:08:13.669 --> 02:08:13.679 align:start position:0%
of the 100
 
02:08:14.870 --> 02:08:14.880 align:start position:0%
that we had
 
02:08:18.149 --> 02:08:18.159 align:start position:0%
have available to to add back into
 
02:08:21.189 --> 02:08:21.199 align:start position:0%
the fy21 base
 
02:08:24.310 --> 02:08:24.320 align:start position:0%
so so we're at 93 million at this point
 
02:08:25.510 --> 02:08:25.520 align:start position:0%
i think
 
02:08:27.510 --> 02:08:27.520 align:start position:0%
are there are
 
02:08:29.589 --> 02:08:29.599 align:start position:0%
are there any questions i i happen to
 
02:08:31.990 --> 02:08:32.000 align:start position:0%
think that this is a line that we would
 
02:08:38.229 --> 02:08:38.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:40.870 --> 02:08:40.880 align:start position:0%
i'm not i'm not seeing any uh questions
 
02:08:44.470 --> 02:08:44.480 align:start position:0%
here so let's go to
 
02:08:47.910 --> 02:08:47.920 align:start position:0%
the long-term care support line
 
02:08:49.830 --> 02:08:49.840 align:start position:0%
before we do that there are actually two
 
02:08:51.910 --> 02:08:51.920 align:start position:0%
other accounting units associated with
 
02:08:51.920 --> 02:08:52.950 align:start position:0%
other accounting units associated with
um

02:08:52.950 --> 02:08:52.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:08:54.470 --> 02:08:54.480 align:start position:0%
that are
 
02:08:56.069 --> 02:08:56.079 align:start position:0%
also associated with developmental
 
02:08:56.079 --> 02:08:57.270 align:start position:0%
also associated with developmental
services

02:08:57.270 --> 02:08:57.280 align:start position:0%
services
 
02:08:58.709 --> 02:08:58.719 align:start position:0%
which is
 
02:09:02.790 --> 02:09:02.800 align:start position:0%
acquired brain disorder which is 7016
 
02:09:02.800 --> 02:09:03.750 align:start position:0%
acquired brain disorder which is 7016
and

02:09:03.750 --> 02:09:03.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:09:18.470 --> 02:09:18.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:20.229 --> 02:09:20.239 align:start position:0%
revolving accounts
 
02:09:23.030 --> 02:09:23.040 align:start position:0%
yeah so these um
 
02:09:24.870 --> 02:09:24.880 align:start position:0%
the governor's budget
 
02:09:28.550 --> 02:09:28.560 align:start position:0%
represents a decrease in what's in fy 21
 
02:09:31.270 --> 02:09:31.280 align:start position:0%
but because it's a revolving account you
 
02:09:33.669 --> 02:09:33.679 align:start position:0%
think you have the resources to to do
 
02:09:37.189 --> 02:09:37.199 align:start position:0%
what's needed for 7016 over the coming
 
02:09:40.790 --> 02:09:40.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:43.350 --> 02:09:43.360 align:start position:0%
correct so that's why you see a decrease
 
02:09:45.910 --> 02:09:45.920 align:start position:0%
in general funds from fiscal year 21 in
 
02:09:47.510 --> 02:09:47.520 align:start position:0%
both years
 
02:09:50.069 --> 02:09:50.079 align:start position:0%
but i believe um
 
02:09:52.550 --> 02:09:52.560 align:start position:0%
from what i've been explained of
 
02:09:54.870 --> 02:09:54.880 align:start position:0%
representative or spreadsheet it may be
 
02:09:58.310 --> 02:09:58.320 align:start position:0%
that the 22 total appropriation would be
 
02:10:01.589 --> 02:10:01.599 align:start position:0%
represented in both 22 and 23.
 
02:10:04.149 --> 02:10:04.159 align:start position:0%
his working document in this case i
 
02:10:06.790 --> 02:10:06.800 align:start position:0%
believe assumes the governor's budget
 
02:10:08.390 --> 02:10:08.400 align:start position:0%
numbers could you confirm that
 
02:10:10.629 --> 02:10:10.639 align:start position:0%
representative yes yes sir that is
 
02:10:10.639 --> 02:10:11.510 align:start position:0%
representative yes yes sir that is
correct

02:10:11.510 --> 02:10:11.520 align:start position:0%
correct
 
02:10:14.390 --> 02:10:14.400 align:start position:0%
okay so we could we could ex we could
 
02:10:18.149 --> 02:10:18.159 align:start position:0%
on 7016 accept the governor's budget and
 
02:10:21.030 --> 02:10:21.040 align:start position:0%
it would no would not have an impact
 
02:10:23.350 --> 02:10:23.360 align:start position:0%
on the amount of money we have available
 
02:10:25.510 --> 02:10:25.520 align:start position:0%
for add-backs no it actually would
 
02:10:27.910 --> 02:10:27.920 align:start position:0%
increase because in the second year it's
 
02:10:30.390 --> 02:10:30.400 align:start position:0%
14 million in the governor's budget so
 
02:10:31.910 --> 02:10:31.920 align:start position:0%
that would be three million dollars
 
02:10:33.189 --> 02:10:33.199 align:start position:0%
higher than the
 
02:10:35.350 --> 02:10:35.360 align:start position:0%
and the eleven oh
 
02:10:36.950 --> 02:10:36.960 align:start position:0%
okay so there's a
 
02:10:41.990 --> 02:10:42.000 align:start position:0%
there's a a 2.6 million dollar
 
02:10:44.069 --> 02:10:44.079 align:start position:0%
bill here
 
02:10:45.189 --> 02:10:45.199 align:start position:0%
is that right
 
02:10:47.750 --> 02:10:47.760 align:start position:0%
i i can't do mental math very well well
 
02:10:49.430 --> 02:10:49.440 align:start position:0%
i was saying three but 2.6 is probably
 
02:10:51.589 --> 02:10:51.599 align:start position:0%
right yes it's in that range
 
02:10:51.599 --> 02:10:52.470 align:start position:0%
right yes it's in that range
so

02:10:52.470 --> 02:10:52.480 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:10:54.629 --> 02:10:54.639 align:start position:0%
let's go ahead and keep it free just to
 
02:10:56.870 --> 02:10:56.880 align:start position:0%
keep it simple so
 
02:10:58.709 --> 02:10:58.719 align:start position:0%
if we were at
 
02:11:04.149 --> 02:11:04.159 align:start position:0%
93 we're now at about 96.
 
02:11:06.629 --> 02:11:06.639 align:start position:0%
um so so let's
 
02:11:23.270 --> 02:11:23.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:24.870 --> 02:11:24.880 align:start position:0%
so this looks like
 
02:11:24.880 --> 02:11:26.069 align:start position:0%
so this looks like
from

02:11:26.069 --> 02:11:26.079 align:start position:0%
from
 
02:11:28.950 --> 02:11:28.960 align:start position:0%
your work document
 
02:11:31.830 --> 02:11:31.840 align:start position:0%
the only uh
 
02:11:33.990 --> 02:11:34.000 align:start position:0%
effect of the of accepting the
 
02:11:35.589 --> 02:11:35.599 align:start position:0%
governor's budget
 
02:11:36.830 --> 02:11:36.840 align:start position:0%
is that the
 
02:11:40.470 --> 02:11:40.480 align:start position:0%
4.4 in fy 23
 
02:11:43.750 --> 02:11:43.760 align:start position:0%
represents about a 700 000
 
02:11:47.589 --> 02:11:47.599 align:start position:0%
increase from your work document
 
02:11:47.599 --> 02:11:51.510 align:start position:0%
increase from your work document
correct

02:11:51.510 --> 02:11:51.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:55.270 --> 02:11:55.280 align:start position:0%
so we were at 96 let's say we're at
 
02:11:55.280 --> 02:11:56.950 align:start position:0%
so we were at 96 let's say we're at
97

02:11:56.950 --> 02:11:56.960 align:start position:0%
97
 
02:11:58.790 --> 02:11:58.800 align:start position:0%
out of 100.
 
02:12:02.149 --> 02:12:02.159 align:start position:0%
so is there any discussion around
 
02:12:04.790 --> 02:12:04.800 align:start position:0%
accepting or modifying the governor's
 
02:12:07.589 --> 02:12:07.599 align:start position:0%
proposal on this line item we talked
 
02:12:07.599 --> 02:12:08.790 align:start position:0%
proposal on this line item we talked
about

02:12:08.790 --> 02:12:08.800 align:start position:0%
about
 
02:12:11.669 --> 02:12:11.679 align:start position:0%
is this uh is this this is 7110 we
 
02:12:15.109 --> 02:12:15.119 align:start position:0%
talked about 7100 7016.
 
02:12:17.830 --> 02:12:17.840 align:start position:0%
so far all three of them
 
02:12:20.790 --> 02:12:20.800 align:start position:0%
the the working conversation is around
 
02:12:23.270 --> 02:12:23.280 align:start position:0%
accepting the governor's budget proposal
 
02:12:25.109 --> 02:12:25.119 align:start position:0%
on these lines
 
02:12:27.430 --> 02:12:27.440 align:start position:0%
does any of the committee want to
 
02:12:30.950 --> 02:12:30.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:32.950 --> 02:12:32.960 align:start position:0%
all right
 
02:12:34.709 --> 02:12:34.719 align:start position:0%
well now let's go to long-term care
 
02:12:34.719 --> 02:12:41.910 align:start position:0%
well now let's go to long-term care
supports

02:12:41.910 --> 02:12:41.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:44.390 --> 02:12:44.400 align:start position:0%
so what accounts specifically i'm sorry
 
02:12:46.149 --> 02:12:46.159 align:start position:0%
what account do you mean by long-term
 
02:12:46.159 --> 02:13:01.030 align:start position:0%
what account do you mean by long-term
supports

02:13:01.030 --> 02:13:01.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:04.390 --> 02:13:04.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:07.510 --> 02:13:07.520 align:start position:0%
counting cap discussion
 
02:13:08.709 --> 02:13:08.719 align:start position:0%
it is
 
02:13:10.390 --> 02:13:10.400 align:start position:0%
yes yeah
 
02:13:11.910 --> 02:13:11.920 align:start position:0%
i want to postpone that to this
 
02:13:13.430 --> 02:13:13.440 align:start position:0%
afternoon anyways
 
02:13:15.990 --> 02:13:16.000 align:start position:0%
is there what well what else
 
02:13:20.709 --> 02:13:20.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:23.109 --> 02:13:23.119 align:start position:0%
that that's it that's
 
02:13:24.950 --> 02:13:24.960 align:start position:0%
everything else is just
 
02:13:27.109 --> 02:13:27.119 align:start position:0%
not just it's medicaid administration
 
02:13:30.790 --> 02:13:30.800 align:start position:0%
not payments to providers so that's um
 
02:13:34.390 --> 02:13:34.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:34.400 --> 02:13:35.350 align:start position:0%
 
so

02:13:35.350 --> 02:13:35.360 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:13:35.360 --> 02:13:36.709 align:start position:0%
so
um

02:13:36.709 --> 02:13:36.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:13:39.750 --> 02:13:39.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:43.030 --> 02:13:43.040 align:start position:0%
i think we're ready to go look at tanf
 
02:13:44.629 --> 02:13:44.639 align:start position:0%
uh representative wallner do you have a
 
02:13:46.950 --> 02:13:46.960 align:start position:0%
question could we just take a look at
 
02:13:49.589 --> 02:13:49.599 align:start position:0%
the medicaid administration lines
 
02:13:56.149 --> 02:13:56.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:58.870 --> 02:13:58.880 align:start position:0%
how we how that is
 
02:14:02.390 --> 02:14:02.400 align:start position:0%
if if that's a lot lower
 
02:14:05.030 --> 02:14:05.040 align:start position:0%
than the governor's
 
02:14:05.040 --> 02:14:08.470 align:start position:0%
than the governor's
budget

02:14:08.470 --> 02:14:08.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:09.990 --> 02:14:10.000 align:start position:0%
i'd have to wonder how they're going to
 
02:14:12.790 --> 02:14:12.800 align:start position:0%
be able to
 
02:14:16.310 --> 02:14:16.320 align:start position:0%
do all this work okay
 
02:14:16.320 --> 02:14:18.229 align:start position:0%
do all this work okay
so

02:14:18.229 --> 02:14:18.239 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:14:18.239 --> 02:14:19.109 align:start position:0%
so
just

02:14:19.109 --> 02:14:19.119 align:start position:0%
just
 
02:14:23.669 --> 02:14:23.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:31.669 --> 02:14:31.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:34.149 --> 02:14:34.159 align:start position:0%
now medicaid administration we earn all
 
02:14:36.709 --> 02:14:36.719 align:start position:0%
across the department it's not just in
 
02:14:38.390 --> 02:14:38.400 align:start position:0%
one area
 
02:14:38.400 --> 02:14:40.950 align:start position:0%
one area
um

02:14:40.950 --> 02:14:40.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:14:42.629 --> 02:14:42.639 align:start position:0%
but there is
 
02:14:44.950 --> 02:14:44.960 align:start position:0%
the medicaid administration accounting
 
02:14:46.550 --> 02:14:46.560 align:start position:0%
unit which is just related to
 
02:14:48.069 --> 02:14:48.079 align:start position:0%
administering the standard medicaid
 
02:14:50.390 --> 02:14:50.400 align:start position:0%
account which is 7937
 
02:14:52.790 --> 02:14:52.800 align:start position:0%
it's on page 990.
 
02:14:52.800 --> 02:15:08.229 align:start position:0%
it's on page 990.
9.90

02:15:08.229 --> 02:15:08.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:10.390 --> 02:15:10.400 align:start position:0%
so ms rounds um
 
02:15:12.629 --> 02:15:12.639 align:start position:0%
while uh representative uh
 
02:15:14.550 --> 02:15:14.560 align:start position:0%
walnut looks at that and gets ready to
 
02:15:16.310 --> 02:15:16.320 align:start position:0%
ask you questions
 
02:15:16.320 --> 02:15:18.229 align:start position:0%
ask you questions
um

02:15:18.229 --> 02:15:18.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:15:18.239 --> 02:15:19.189 align:start position:0%
um
i

02:15:19.189 --> 02:15:19.199 align:start position:0%
i
 
02:15:21.669 --> 02:15:21.679 align:start position:0%
based on what i've been thinking i would
 
02:15:23.510 --> 02:15:23.520 align:start position:0%
like to see
 
02:15:28.149 --> 02:15:28.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:30.709 --> 02:15:30.719 align:start position:0%
authorized personnel
 
02:15:34.390 --> 02:15:34.400 align:start position:0%
do you happen to know how many personnel
 
02:15:37.510 --> 02:15:37.520 align:start position:0%
permanent authorized there were for 19
 
02:15:40.149 --> 02:15:40.159 align:start position:0%
in this line
 
02:15:44.470 --> 02:15:44.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:44.480 --> 02:15:45.510 align:start position:0%
 
so

02:15:45.510 --> 02:15:45.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:15:45.520 --> 02:15:47.270 align:start position:0%
so
so

02:15:47.270 --> 02:15:47.280 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:15:49.510 --> 02:15:49.520 align:start position:0%
it's going to be very difficult to
 
02:15:49.520 --> 02:15:50.790 align:start position:0%
it's going to be very difficult to
compare

02:15:50.790 --> 02:15:50.800 align:start position:0%
compare
 
02:15:53.589 --> 02:15:53.599 align:start position:0%
the adjusted authorized numbers
 
02:15:56.229 --> 02:15:56.239 align:start position:0%
by accounting unit for fiscal year 19
 
02:15:58.870 --> 02:15:58.880 align:start position:0%
because we moved a lot of positions in
 
02:16:02.149 --> 02:16:02.159 align:start position:0%
20 and 21 to be in the right place
 
02:16:02.159 --> 02:16:02.950 align:start position:0%
20 and 21 to be in the right place
so

02:16:02.950 --> 02:16:02.960 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:16:04.629 --> 02:16:04.639 align:start position:0%
it would be very difficult to do by
 
02:16:06.950 --> 02:16:06.960 align:start position:0%
accounting unit
 
02:16:09.830 --> 02:16:09.840 align:start position:0%
so you know in general what i'm what i'm
 
02:16:12.149 --> 02:16:12.159 align:start position:0%
thinking about proposing
 
02:16:13.750 --> 02:16:13.760 align:start position:0%
is for us to
 
02:16:13.760 --> 02:16:15.270 align:start position:0%
is for us to
uh

02:16:15.270 --> 02:16:15.280 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:16:18.229 --> 02:16:18.239 align:start position:0%
use all of the 2019
 
02:16:21.109 --> 02:16:21.119 align:start position:0%
uh authorized permanent positions
 
02:16:23.270 --> 02:16:23.280 align:start position:0%
and not the 21
 
02:16:26.470 --> 02:16:26.480 align:start position:0%
and not the proposal in 23.
 
02:16:26.480 --> 02:16:27.510 align:start position:0%
and not the proposal in 23.
so

02:16:27.510 --> 02:16:27.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:16:27.520 --> 02:16:28.470 align:start position:0%
so
so

02:16:28.470 --> 02:16:28.480 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:16:29.830 --> 02:16:29.840 align:start position:0%
i don't know how to have that
 
02:16:31.830 --> 02:16:31.840 align:start position:0%
conversation because that that sounds
 
02:16:34.309 --> 02:16:34.319 align:start position:0%
like it would be a very complicated
 
02:16:36.309 --> 02:16:36.319 align:start position:0%
hard thing to do but
 
02:16:37.509 --> 02:16:37.519 align:start position:0%
but i
 
02:16:39.349 --> 02:16:39.359 align:start position:0%
i would like to have
 
02:16:40.389 --> 02:16:40.399 align:start position:0%
go ahead
 
02:16:42.309 --> 02:16:42.319 align:start position:0%
i so i
 
02:16:43.990 --> 02:16:44.000 align:start position:0%
i mean i i really can't have that
 
02:16:45.910 --> 02:16:45.920 align:start position:0%
conversation without telling you all of
 
02:16:47.750 --> 02:16:47.760 align:start position:0%
the potential consequences right like
 
02:16:49.110 --> 02:16:49.120 align:start position:0%
we're not going to have as many beds at
 
02:16:51.349 --> 02:16:51.359 align:start position:0%
new hampshire hospital available
 
02:16:54.230 --> 02:16:54.240 align:start position:0%
our case loads per caseworker and dcyf
 
02:16:56.549 --> 02:16:56.559 align:start position:0%
would go up uh you know i'm not going to
 
02:16:58.389 --> 02:16:58.399 align:start position:0%
file reports timely with the federal
 
02:17:01.429 --> 02:17:01.439 align:start position:0%
government uh we're not going to get con
 
02:17:03.429 --> 02:17:03.439 align:start position:0%
every contract that goes to gnc will
 
02:17:05.830 --> 02:17:05.840 align:start position:0%
probably be retroactive and
 
02:17:07.589 --> 02:17:07.599 align:start position:0%
you know like there are serious
 
02:17:11.349 --> 02:17:11.359 align:start position:0%
consequences for going to that level
 
02:17:14.230 --> 02:17:14.240 align:start position:0%
so can i tell you my simple perhaps
 
02:17:17.349 --> 02:17:17.359 align:start position:0%
overly naive assumption though sure
 
02:17:19.750 --> 02:17:19.760 align:start position:0%
and and why i didn't think it was a
 
02:17:22.709 --> 02:17:22.719 align:start position:0%
crazy idea to begin with and that is
 
02:17:22.719 --> 02:17:23.509 align:start position:0%
crazy idea to begin with and that is
that

02:17:23.509 --> 02:17:23.519 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:17:27.110 --> 02:17:27.120 align:start position:0%
whenever we heard the department talking
 
02:17:29.910 --> 02:17:29.920 align:start position:0%
they had vacancy rates
 
02:17:31.509 --> 02:17:31.519 align:start position:0%
and um
 
02:17:33.589 --> 02:17:33.599 align:start position:0%
and when i looked at the
 
02:17:36.309 --> 02:17:36.319 align:start position:0%
in general and i wasn't looking line by
 
02:17:38.790 --> 02:17:38.800 align:start position:0%
line but in sort of a top down big
 
02:17:40.230 --> 02:17:40.240 align:start position:0%
picture view
 
02:17:43.190 --> 02:17:43.200 align:start position:0%
it appeared that the actual number of
 
02:17:43.200 --> 02:17:44.549 align:start position:0%
it appeared that the actual number of
personnel

02:17:44.549 --> 02:17:44.559 align:start position:0%
personnel
 
02:17:47.270 --> 02:17:47.280 align:start position:0%
employed in the permanent classified
 
02:17:47.280 --> 02:17:48.790 align:start position:0%
employed in the permanent classified
line

02:17:48.790 --> 02:17:48.800 align:start position:0%
line
 
02:17:50.070 --> 02:17:50.080 align:start position:0%
was lower
 
02:17:52.709 --> 02:17:52.719 align:start position:0%
than the fy 19
 
02:17:55.990 --> 02:17:56.000 align:start position:0%
personal personnel a permanent
 
02:17:56.000 --> 02:17:57.509 align:start position:0%
personal personnel a permanent
authorized

02:17:57.509 --> 02:17:57.519 align:start position:0%
authorized
 
02:18:00.549 --> 02:18:00.559 align:start position:0%
and and and that gap
 
02:18:02.790 --> 02:18:02.800 align:start position:0%
would theoretically provide an
 
02:18:05.750 --> 02:18:05.760 align:start position:0%
opportunity to continue to hire
 
02:18:08.870 --> 02:18:08.880 align:start position:0%
and continue to
 
02:18:10.790 --> 02:18:10.800 align:start position:0%
become how help the department become
 
02:18:12.309 --> 02:18:12.319 align:start position:0%
more effective
 
02:18:15.110 --> 02:18:15.120 align:start position:0%
that that rolling back to 19 didn't
 
02:18:19.030 --> 02:18:19.040 align:start position:0%
actually represent a cut in employees
 
02:18:20.709 --> 02:18:20.719 align:start position:0%
because there was still room between
 
02:18:23.429 --> 02:18:23.439 align:start position:0%
that number and the vacancy number
 
02:18:23.439 --> 02:18:24.549 align:start position:0%
that number and the vacancy number
now now

02:18:24.549 --> 02:18:24.559 align:start position:0%
now now
 
02:18:26.790 --> 02:18:26.800 align:start position:0%
so we should schedule it and have a have
 
02:18:28.709 --> 02:18:28.719 align:start position:0%
a discussion about that i don't i don't
 
02:18:31.910 --> 02:18:31.920 align:start position:0%
want to do anything stupid you know but
 
02:18:33.990 --> 02:18:34.000 align:start position:0%
but i do want to talk through that
 
02:18:34.000 --> 02:18:35.349 align:start position:0%
but i do want to talk through that
concept

02:18:35.349 --> 02:18:35.359 align:start position:0%
concept
 
02:18:37.270 --> 02:18:37.280 align:start position:0%
okay yeah and i think it's a little
 
02:18:38.870 --> 02:18:38.880 align:start position:0%
difficult uh
 
02:18:40.549 --> 02:18:40.559 align:start position:0%
right now because we've just come off of
 
02:18:42.709 --> 02:18:42.719 align:start position:0%
a year-long hiring freeze
 
02:18:45.509 --> 02:18:45.519 align:start position:0%
during that year which we hired maybe 30
 
02:18:47.910 --> 02:18:47.920 align:start position:0%
people um which when you're considering
 
02:18:51.589 --> 02:18:51.599 align:start position:0%
a 3 000 employee department it is
 
02:18:53.589 --> 02:18:53.599 align:start position:0%
it's a little difficult to think that we
 
02:18:55.110 --> 02:18:55.120 align:start position:0%
could stay at the staffing levels we're
 
02:18:56.389 --> 02:18:56.399 align:start position:0%
at right now
 
02:18:58.790 --> 02:18:58.800 align:start position:0%
yes ma'am i i know that's why we should
 
02:19:01.270 --> 02:19:01.280 align:start position:0%
have that conversation and
 
02:19:03.509 --> 02:19:03.519 align:start position:0%
we'll schedule it
 
02:19:07.669 --> 02:19:07.679 align:start position:0%
okay all right so representative
 
02:19:09.990 --> 02:19:10.000 align:start position:0%
i'm just looking at the uh medicaid
 
02:19:10.000 --> 02:19:11.669 align:start position:0%
i'm just looking at the uh medicaid
administration

02:19:11.669 --> 02:19:11.679 align:start position:0%
administration
 
02:19:14.389 --> 02:19:14.399 align:start position:0%
lines um
 
02:19:18.790 --> 02:19:18.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:22.230 --> 02:19:22.240 align:start position:0%
i i assume you what what what number is
 
02:19:24.870 --> 02:19:24.880 align:start position:0%
on the um
 
02:19:27.349 --> 02:19:27.359 align:start position:0%
representative earth's document
 
02:19:30.870 --> 02:19:30.880 align:start position:0%
i i would say it's probably the fy 21
 
02:19:32.389 --> 02:19:32.399 align:start position:0%
number of
 
02:19:35.030 --> 02:19:35.040 align:start position:0%
5 million okay so that's what i was
 
02:19:37.270 --> 02:19:37.280 align:start position:0%
thinking so it looks like we're about
 
02:19:40.469 --> 02:19:40.479 align:start position:0%
three million dollars
 
02:19:44.070 --> 02:19:44.080 align:start position:0%
short in each year of general funds
 
02:19:46.629 --> 02:19:46.639 align:start position:0%
yeah so that would be a fresh six
 
02:19:50.230 --> 02:19:50.240 align:start position:0%
million uh request and given our last
 
02:19:51.910 --> 02:19:51.920 align:start position:0%
number i think
 
02:19:54.389 --> 02:19:54.399 align:start position:0%
uh was 97 million
 
02:19:57.270 --> 02:19:57.280 align:start position:0%
that would make us at 103.
 
02:19:59.349 --> 02:19:59.359 align:start position:0%
so representative er if you want to
 
02:20:00.830 --> 02:20:00.840 align:start position:0%
correct us or
 
02:20:02.790 --> 02:20:02.800 align:start position:0%
clarify no
 
02:20:04.469 --> 02:20:04.479 align:start position:0%
i just want to point out that so far
 
02:20:06.710 --> 02:20:06.720 align:start position:0%
what we've been increasing is the
 
02:20:09.270 --> 02:20:09.280 align:start position:0%
amounts like the 3.1 increase and all
 
02:20:11.110 --> 02:20:11.120 align:start position:0%
that not necessarily increasing the
 
02:20:13.030 --> 02:20:13.040 align:start position:0%
workload which i think is what would be
 
02:20:16.790 --> 02:20:16.800 align:start position:0%
in this account i'm not mistaken
 
02:20:18.630 --> 02:20:18.640 align:start position:0%
i think your point is that the
 
02:20:20.950 --> 02:20:20.960 align:start position:0%
administration line ought to be able to
 
02:20:23.349 --> 02:20:23.359 align:start position:0%
absorb the work because we're increasing
 
02:20:24.469 --> 02:20:24.479 align:start position:0%
the the
 
02:20:27.190 --> 02:20:27.200 align:start position:0%
dollars moving but not necessarily the
 
02:20:31.110 --> 02:20:31.120 align:start position:0%
workload underneath it
 
02:20:33.030 --> 02:20:33.040 align:start position:0%
is that what you
 
02:20:34.630 --> 02:20:34.640 align:start position:0%
i want you i just want to understand
 
02:20:36.309 --> 02:20:36.319 align:start position:0%
representative first
 
02:20:39.270 --> 02:20:39.280 align:start position:0%
yes sir i'm sorry yes
 
02:20:41.270 --> 02:20:41.280 align:start position:0%
can i see representative irv spreadsheet
 
02:20:44.950 --> 02:20:44.960 align:start position:0%
on the screen yeah
 
02:20:47.429 --> 02:20:47.439 align:start position:0%
what is this accounting unit um
 
02:20:49.349 --> 02:20:49.359 align:start position:0%
you turn on the medicaid services one
 
02:20:52.309 --> 02:20:52.319 align:start position:0%
yeah four seven zero zero
 
02:20:52.319 --> 02:20:53.030 align:start position:0%
yeah four seven zero zero
uh

02:20:53.030 --> 02:20:53.040 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:21:05.990 --> 02:21:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:06.000 --> 02:21:09.030 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:21:09.030 --> 02:21:09.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:10.389 --> 02:21:10.399 align:start position:0%
it seems like there's something else
 
02:21:12.550 --> 02:21:12.560 align:start position:0%
going on here because we're we're
 
02:21:15.429 --> 02:21:15.439 align:start position:0%
collecting a lot more federal money on
 
02:21:16.710 --> 02:21:16.720 align:start position:0%
this line
 
02:21:19.349 --> 02:21:19.359 align:start position:0%
than ever before so i
 
02:21:21.429 --> 02:21:21.439 align:start position:0%
would like to
 
02:21:26.309 --> 02:21:26.319 align:start position:0%
hear what an explanation of that is too
 
02:21:27.990 --> 02:21:28.000 align:start position:0%
18 19 kevin
 
02:21:28.000 --> 02:21:38.870 align:start position:0%
18 19 kevin
okay

02:21:38.870 --> 02:21:38.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:42.710 --> 02:21:42.720 align:start position:0%
so looking at like class 10
 
02:21:44.150 --> 02:21:44.160 align:start position:0%
so going a little bit back to the
 
02:21:47.790 --> 02:21:47.800 align:start position:0%
personnel discussion we're just having
 
02:21:51.349 --> 02:21:51.359 align:start position:0%
22 and 23 are budgeted
 
02:21:55.190 --> 02:21:55.200 align:start position:0%
to include things like um step increases
 
02:21:57.830 --> 02:21:57.840 align:start position:0%
which are required by the union contract
 
02:21:59.590 --> 02:21:59.600 align:start position:0%
and then of course there's an extra pay
 
02:22:01.670 --> 02:22:01.680 align:start position:0%
period in 23.
 
02:22:05.190 --> 02:22:05.200 align:start position:0%
so by level funding it to 21 on the
 
02:22:07.270 --> 02:22:07.280 align:start position:0%
salary class line you have essentially
 
02:22:09.190 --> 02:22:09.200 align:start position:0%
cut positions
 
02:22:10.389 --> 02:22:10.399 align:start position:0%
and if that's what's happened all
 
02:22:11.670 --> 02:22:11.680 align:start position:0%
throughout this document you've already
 
02:22:12.870 --> 02:22:12.880 align:start position:0%
cut positions all throughout the
 
02:22:12.880 --> 02:22:13.910 align:start position:0%
cut positions all throughout the
document

02:22:13.910 --> 02:22:13.920 align:start position:0%
document
 
02:22:15.830 --> 02:22:15.840 align:start position:0%
because we won't be able to hire all the
 
02:22:18.309 --> 02:22:18.319 align:start position:0%
positions because we'll have to absorb
 
02:22:21.190 --> 02:22:21.200 align:start position:0%
any step increases in employees pay as
 
02:22:24.790 --> 02:22:24.800 align:start position:0%
well as that extra pay period in 23.
 
02:22:25.990 --> 02:22:26.000 align:start position:0%
you don't happen to know what your
 
02:22:29.270 --> 02:22:29.280 align:start position:0%
vacancies are in this line item though
 
02:22:30.469 --> 02:22:30.479 align:start position:0%
that would be
 
02:22:32.469 --> 02:22:32.479 align:start position:0%
that would be a level of
 
02:22:34.550 --> 02:22:34.560 align:start position:0%
detail that no person could carry around
 
02:22:37.030 --> 02:22:37.040 align:start position:0%
in their head i don't but i i guess i'm
 
02:22:38.550 --> 02:22:38.560 align:start position:0%
just saying if that's what you've done
 
02:22:40.630 --> 02:22:40.640 align:start position:0%
in every personnel section there are
 
02:22:42.870 --> 02:22:42.880 align:start position:0%
sections where
 
02:22:45.349 --> 02:22:45.359 align:start position:0%
they're it's fully staffed and so we
 
02:22:45.359 --> 02:22:46.790 align:start position:0%
they're it's fully staffed and so we
would

02:22:46.790 --> 02:22:46.800 align:start position:0%
would
 
02:22:48.870 --> 02:22:48.880 align:start position:0%
we would need to transfer funds around
 
02:22:52.550 --> 02:22:52.560 align:start position:0%
the department to not lay people off
 
02:22:52.560 --> 02:22:55.030 align:start position:0%
the department to not lay people off
um

02:22:55.030 --> 02:22:55.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:56.950 --> 02:22:56.960 align:start position:0%
and then do not you want to know what my
 
02:22:59.750 --> 02:22:59.760 align:start position:0%
real hope is ms
 
02:23:02.070 --> 02:23:02.080 align:start position:0%
okay so here's my real hope
 
02:23:04.790 --> 02:23:04.800 align:start position:0%
that division three
 
02:23:04.800 --> 02:23:06.309 align:start position:0%
that division three
pass

02:23:06.309 --> 02:23:06.319 align:start position:0%
pass
 
02:23:09.830 --> 02:23:09.840 align:start position:0%
passes a really good conceptual budget
 
02:23:12.870 --> 02:23:12.880 align:start position:0%
that um
 
02:23:15.349 --> 02:23:15.359 align:start position:0%
that the senate will will use as a
 
02:23:17.030 --> 02:23:17.040 align:start position:0%
reference point
 
02:23:19.990 --> 02:23:20.000 align:start position:0%
and that the department will have a
 
02:23:22.389 --> 02:23:22.399 align:start position:0%
little bit more time to look at and and
 
02:23:25.510 --> 02:23:25.520 align:start position:0%
be able to offer some good fine-tuning
 
02:23:28.230 --> 02:23:28.240 align:start position:0%
uh recommendations to the senate
 
02:23:30.790 --> 02:23:30.800 align:start position:0%
and that and that after the senate works
 
02:23:33.670 --> 02:23:33.680 align:start position:0%
on it we still have a few months before
 
02:23:35.110 --> 02:23:35.120 align:start position:0%
the committee conference locks
 
02:23:36.710 --> 02:23:36.720 align:start position:0%
everything down
 
02:23:40.469 --> 02:23:40.479 align:start position:0%
and so i i'm not my goal and maybe i'm
 
02:23:43.110 --> 02:23:43.120 align:start position:0%
wrong but my goal is not to pass a
 
02:23:44.950 --> 02:23:44.960 align:start position:0%
perfect budget
 
02:23:47.590 --> 02:23:47.600 align:start position:0%
but a really good one that communicates
 
02:23:50.150 --> 02:23:50.160 align:start position:0%
clearly a conceptual framework of what
 
02:23:52.070 --> 02:23:52.080 align:start position:0%
we're trying to do
 
02:23:53.270 --> 02:23:53.280 align:start position:0%
knowing that
 
02:23:53.280 --> 02:23:54.230 align:start position:0%
knowing that
it's

02:23:54.230 --> 02:23:54.240 align:start position:0%
it's
 
02:23:55.670 --> 02:23:55.680 align:start position:0%
whatever we do
 
02:23:58.230 --> 02:23:58.240 align:start position:0%
is going to get amended twice and and
 
02:24:00.070 --> 02:24:00.080 align:start position:0%
that we've got a couple months to get
 
02:24:02.550 --> 02:24:02.560 align:start position:0%
smarter and to make those amendments and
 
02:24:06.150 --> 02:24:06.160 align:start position:0%
fine-tuning not not us our division
 
02:24:08.309 --> 02:24:08.319 align:start position:0%
but the senate and the committee
 
02:24:08.319 --> 02:24:09.590 align:start position:0%
but the senate and the committee
conference

02:24:09.590 --> 02:24:09.600 align:start position:0%
conference
 
02:24:11.670 --> 02:24:11.680 align:start position:0%
so i kind of trust the process that
 
02:24:13.750 --> 02:24:13.760 align:start position:0%
comes after us
 
02:24:16.710 --> 02:24:16.720 align:start position:0%
to to clean up some of the details
 
02:24:16.720 --> 02:24:19.110 align:start position:0%
to to clean up some of the details
okay

02:24:19.110 --> 02:24:19.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:20.790 --> 02:24:20.800 align:start position:0%
at the same time
 
02:24:22.790 --> 02:24:22.800 align:start position:0%
i don't want to
 
02:24:24.150 --> 02:24:24.160 align:start position:0%
hand off
 
02:24:26.389 --> 02:24:26.399 align:start position:0%
a mess
 
02:24:29.030 --> 02:24:29.040 align:start position:0%
so so the more so we're going to talk
 
02:24:32.070 --> 02:24:32.080 align:start position:0%
about the personnel issue and and if my
 
02:24:32.080 --> 02:24:33.110 align:start position:0%
about the personnel issue and and if my
concept

02:24:33.110 --> 02:24:33.120 align:start position:0%
concept
 
02:24:35.190 --> 02:24:35.200 align:start position:0%
doesn't really work
 
02:24:37.830 --> 02:24:37.840 align:start position:0%
i'll change it
 
02:24:39.990 --> 02:24:40.000 align:start position:0%
okay no and i appreciate that i'm just
 
02:24:41.830 --> 02:24:41.840 align:start position:0%
trying to give you real-time feedback on
 
02:24:43.510 --> 02:24:43.520 align:start position:0%
what i'm seeing
 
02:24:45.910 --> 02:24:45.920 align:start position:0%
um in this document and i would have
 
02:24:47.190 --> 02:24:47.200 align:start position:0%
some of the same concerns with the
 
02:24:49.510 --> 02:24:49.520 align:start position:0%
benefits line we we don't have any
 
02:24:51.750 --> 02:24:51.760 align:start position:0%
control over what the benefits cost and
 
02:24:54.469 --> 02:24:54.479 align:start position:0%
if people have changed plans and all
 
02:24:56.469 --> 02:24:56.479 align:start position:0%
that type of stuff that that certainly
 
02:24:59.349 --> 02:24:59.359 align:start position:0%
in fact impacts the budget line
 
02:25:01.110 --> 02:25:01.120 align:start position:0%
the other thing i would
 
02:25:02.150 --> 02:25:02.160 align:start position:0%
go ahead
 
02:25:04.230 --> 02:25:04.240 align:start position:0%
no no i i
 
02:25:07.030 --> 02:25:07.040 align:start position:0%
it was rude so i'm sorry
 
02:25:08.790 --> 02:25:08.800 align:start position:0%
the other thing i was just going to
 
02:25:13.110 --> 02:25:13.120 align:start position:0%
mention is that class lines 40 41 and 42
 
02:25:14.790 --> 02:25:14.800 align:start position:0%
are all 100
 
02:25:16.790 --> 02:25:16.800 align:start position:0%
non-general funds
 
02:25:16.800 --> 02:25:17.910 align:start position:0%
non-general funds
so

02:25:17.910 --> 02:25:17.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:25:19.990 --> 02:25:20.000 align:start position:0%
any changes you've made to those three
 
02:25:22.309 --> 02:25:22.319 align:start position:0%
class lines would not impact the general
 
02:25:24.950 --> 02:25:24.960 align:start position:0%
funds in this accounting unit
 
02:25:26.790 --> 02:25:26.800 align:start position:0%
are in any accounting unit
 
02:25:29.270 --> 02:25:29.280 align:start position:0%
that 40 41 and 42 or
 
02:25:32.790 --> 02:25:32.800 align:start position:0%
are always 100 federal or 100 other or
 
02:25:34.389 --> 02:25:34.399 align:start position:0%
some mix of federal and other there are
 
02:25:36.150 --> 02:25:36.160 align:start position:0%
never general funds in those three class
 
02:25:36.160 --> 02:25:37.429 align:start position:0%
never general funds in those three class
lines

02:25:37.429 --> 02:25:37.439 align:start position:0%
lines
 
02:25:38.950 --> 02:25:38.960 align:start position:0%
and that's the other thing too when it
 
02:25:40.630 --> 02:25:40.640 align:start position:0%
comes to some of these class lines there
 
02:25:42.230 --> 02:25:42.240 align:start position:0%
are times where the fund mix is
 
02:25:45.990 --> 02:25:46.000 align:start position:0%
different than just dividing um
 
02:25:47.830 --> 02:25:47.840 align:start position:0%
by the numbers at the bottom some class
 
02:25:49.910 --> 02:25:49.920 align:start position:0%
lines may have a different fund mix than
 
02:25:51.270 --> 02:25:51.280 align:start position:0%
others especially when it comes to the
 
02:25:56.070 --> 02:25:56.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:58.950 --> 02:25:58.960 align:start position:0%
so i think that's why most budget people
 
02:26:01.429 --> 02:26:01.439 align:start position:0%
really like to have the ability to
 
02:26:03.429 --> 02:26:03.439 align:start position:0%
increase funding because they don't have
 
02:26:06.710 --> 02:26:06.720 align:start position:0%
to worry about the details of having
 
02:26:06.720 --> 02:26:07.990 align:start position:0%
to worry about the details of having
scarcity

02:26:07.990 --> 02:26:08.000 align:start position:0%
scarcity
 
02:26:09.910 --> 02:26:09.920 align:start position:0%
and and we're in a situation where we
 
02:26:12.790 --> 02:26:12.800 align:start position:0%
have to manage scarcity and i don't know
 
02:26:12.800 --> 02:26:13.910 align:start position:0%
have to manage scarcity and i don't know
how

02:26:13.910 --> 02:26:13.920 align:start position:0%
how
 
02:26:16.630 --> 02:26:16.640 align:start position:0%
you know in the in the few weeks
 
02:26:18.550 --> 02:26:18.560 align:start position:0%
even if even if i'd been looking at this
 
02:26:20.550 --> 02:26:20.560 align:start position:0%
budget for you know 10 years i don't
 
02:26:22.389 --> 02:26:22.399 align:start position:0%
know how in a few weeks
 
02:26:24.790 --> 02:26:24.800 align:start position:0%
i would know all the fine-tuning issues
 
02:26:26.309 --> 02:26:26.319 align:start position:0%
around scarcity
 
02:26:28.710 --> 02:26:28.720 align:start position:0%
so represent representative nordgren uh
 
02:26:30.870 --> 02:26:30.880 align:start position:0%
you have your hand up ma'am
 
02:26:30.880 --> 02:26:32.309 align:start position:0%
you have your hand up ma'am
yes

02:26:32.309 --> 02:26:32.319 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:26:35.190 --> 02:26:35.200 align:start position:0%
yes um i guess
 
02:26:37.510 --> 02:26:37.520 align:start position:0%
uh karen brings up
 
02:26:39.910 --> 02:26:39.920 align:start position:0%
concerns that we're all having who've
 
02:26:41.830 --> 02:26:41.840 align:start position:0%
been doing people who've been doing this
 
02:26:45.429 --> 02:26:45.439 align:start position:0%
for 20 30 years that this is a new way
 
02:26:47.750 --> 02:26:47.760 align:start position:0%
of doing it and i think it's really
 
02:26:50.309 --> 02:26:50.319 align:start position:0%
important for her to point out
 
02:26:53.750 --> 02:26:53.760 align:start position:0%
the ramifications of this different
 
02:26:56.230 --> 02:26:56.240 align:start position:0%
process so i would hope we could
 
02:26:56.240 --> 02:26:57.429 align:start position:0%
process so i would hope we could
continue

02:26:57.429 --> 02:26:57.439 align:start position:0%
continue
 
02:27:00.389 --> 02:27:00.399 align:start position:0%
to go through the various line items
 
02:27:01.670 --> 02:27:01.680 align:start position:0%
that she
 
02:27:04.630 --> 02:27:04.640 align:start position:0%
thinks uh we're taking a risk
 
02:27:06.469 --> 02:27:06.479 align:start position:0%
in um how we're
 
02:27:09.110 --> 02:27:09.120 align:start position:0%
doing the process thank you
 
02:27:12.469 --> 02:27:12.479 align:start position:0%
i i agree with you completely
 
02:27:15.349 --> 02:27:15.359 align:start position:0%
and i i am yeah i'm i'm con my biggest
 
02:27:18.710 --> 02:27:18.720 align:start position:0%
concern is the amount of of work that
 
02:27:22.870 --> 02:27:22.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:25.510 --> 02:27:25.520 align:start position:0%
it's not inconceivable that
 
02:27:27.190 --> 02:27:27.200 align:start position:0%
i would have to do a department-wide
 
02:27:29.190 --> 02:27:29.200 align:start position:0%
transfer like
 
02:27:31.030 --> 02:27:31.040 align:start position:0%
by month four of the first year of the
 
02:27:33.270 --> 02:27:33.280 align:start position:0%
fiscal year if what i'm seeing here is
 
02:27:35.270 --> 02:27:35.280 align:start position:0%
is true throughout the other class line
 
02:27:37.110 --> 02:27:37.120 align:start position:0%
so that's my concern
 
02:27:37.120 --> 02:27:38.070 align:start position:0%
so that's my concern
um

02:27:38.070 --> 02:27:38.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:27:40.230 --> 02:27:40.240 align:start position:0%
i think
 
02:27:40.240 --> 02:27:43.270 align:start position:0%
i think
that

02:27:43.270 --> 02:27:43.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:44.710 --> 02:27:44.720 align:start position:0%
i don't know i don't i don't know
 
02:27:46.550 --> 02:27:46.560 align:start position:0%
exactly what to say but
 
02:27:48.950 --> 02:27:48.960 align:start position:0%
certainly if you have
 
02:27:52.550 --> 02:27:52.560 align:start position:0%
areas that um
 
02:27:54.150 --> 02:27:54.160 align:start position:0%
that you would like to see the funding
 
02:27:55.910 --> 02:27:55.920 align:start position:0%
change because you have
 
02:27:57.349 --> 02:27:57.359 align:start position:0%
you know a different
 
02:27:59.990 --> 02:28:00.000 align:start position:0%
uh mission or you know a different way
 
02:28:01.670 --> 02:28:01.680 align:start position:0%
that you think we should do it i i can
 
02:28:03.990 --> 02:28:04.000 align:start position:0%
help a lot and and giving you
 
02:28:06.309 --> 02:28:06.319 align:start position:0%
information to help you understand
 
02:28:06.319 --> 02:28:07.190 align:start position:0%
information to help you understand
what

02:28:07.190 --> 02:28:07.200 align:start position:0%
what
 
02:28:09.429 --> 02:28:09.439 align:start position:0%
changing different funding areas are but
 
02:28:11.429 --> 02:28:11.439 align:start position:0%
it's really hard when it when it's every
 
02:28:14.469 --> 02:28:14.479 align:start position:0%
class line like this because we've made
 
02:28:17.750 --> 02:28:17.760 align:start position:0%
very specific decisions on how to reduce
 
02:28:20.150 --> 02:28:20.160 align:start position:0%
and increase things
 
02:28:20.160 --> 02:28:21.830 align:start position:0%
and increase things
to

02:28:21.830 --> 02:28:21.840 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:28:24.630 --> 02:28:24.640 align:start position:0%
to try to come to a
 
02:28:27.110 --> 02:28:27.120 align:start position:0%
you know a fair budget so
 
02:28:28.790 --> 02:28:28.800 align:start position:0%
that's just my immediate reaction having
 
02:28:30.469 --> 02:28:30.479 align:start position:0%
not spent a lot of time looking at this
 
02:28:30.479 --> 02:28:31.510 align:start position:0%
not spent a lot of time looking at this
document

02:28:31.510 --> 02:28:31.520 align:start position:0%
document
 
02:28:35.349 --> 02:28:35.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:38.150 --> 02:28:38.160 align:start position:0%
okay so to be fair with you what so what
 
02:28:40.870 --> 02:28:40.880 align:start position:0%
my concern is is i look at the the
 
02:28:43.590 --> 02:28:43.600 align:start position:0%
personnel growth over the last
 
02:28:45.590 --> 02:28:45.600 align:start position:0%
the prior budget the current budget the
 
02:28:47.990 --> 02:28:48.000 align:start position:0%
proposed budget
 
02:28:51.110 --> 02:28:51.120 align:start position:0%
we're growing and and realizing that the
 
02:28:54.550 --> 02:28:54.560 align:start position:0%
pandemic cost of hiring freeze
 
02:28:56.870 --> 02:28:56.880 align:start position:0%
you know midway through the
 
02:28:59.750 --> 02:28:59.760 align:start position:0%
current year it's created a big vacancy
 
02:28:59.760 --> 02:29:01.030 align:start position:0%
current year it's created a big vacancy
number

02:29:01.030 --> 02:29:01.040 align:start position:0%
number
 
02:29:01.040 --> 02:29:01.750 align:start position:0%
number
so

02:29:01.750 --> 02:29:01.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:29:05.190 --> 02:29:05.200 align:start position:0%
my concern is that with that that growth
 
02:29:07.270 --> 02:29:07.280 align:start position:0%
rate and the fact that we had
 
02:29:09.510 --> 02:29:09.520 align:start position:0%
the pandemic induced
 
02:29:11.510 --> 02:29:11.520 align:start position:0%
vacancy rate
 
02:29:14.950 --> 02:29:14.960 align:start position:0%
if we accept the personnel growth as it
 
02:29:14.960 --> 02:29:17.030 align:start position:0%
if we accept the personnel growth as it
is

02:29:17.030 --> 02:29:17.040 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:29:19.110 --> 02:29:19.120 align:start position:0%
we're asking the taxpayers of new
 
02:29:19.120 --> 02:29:20.230 align:start position:0%
we're asking the taxpayers of new
hampshire

02:29:20.230 --> 02:29:20.240 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
02:29:23.910 --> 02:29:23.920 align:start position:0%
to fund government at a rate faster than
 
02:29:26.150 --> 02:29:26.160 align:start position:0%
the economy is growing
 
02:29:29.190 --> 02:29:29.200 align:start position:0%
and i that is not a sustainable position
 
02:29:30.790 --> 02:29:30.800 align:start position:0%
we can't do that
 
02:29:32.790 --> 02:29:32.800 align:start position:0%
and every time we hire
 
02:29:35.510 --> 02:29:35.520 align:start position:0%
a permanent classified employee
 
02:29:37.110 --> 02:29:37.120 align:start position:0%
we end up
 
02:29:37.120 --> 02:29:38.070 align:start position:0%
we end up
with

02:29:38.070 --> 02:29:38.080 align:start position:0%
with
 
02:29:41.030 --> 02:29:41.040 align:start position:0%
a long-term tail that is also
 
02:29:43.270 --> 02:29:43.280 align:start position:0%
unsustainable we already have huge
 
02:29:45.990 --> 02:29:46.000 align:start position:0%
problems with our pension funds so every
 
02:29:47.670 --> 02:29:47.680 align:start position:0%
person we put onto the
 
02:29:50.070 --> 02:29:50.080 align:start position:0%
pension fund we're just aggravating that
 
02:29:51.429 --> 02:29:51.439 align:start position:0%
problem to
 
02:29:52.630 --> 02:29:52.640 align:start position:0%
another level
 
02:29:52.640 --> 02:29:53.590 align:start position:0%
another level
so

02:29:53.590 --> 02:29:53.600 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:29:56.389 --> 02:29:56.399 align:start position:0%
i think i think what
 
02:29:58.469 --> 02:29:58.479 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to do and maybe others are
 
02:30:00.550 --> 02:30:00.560 align:start position:0%
trying to do with this budget
 
02:30:02.150 --> 02:30:02.160 align:start position:0%
is to figure out
 
02:30:03.110 --> 02:30:03.120 align:start position:0%
how to
 
02:30:05.910 --> 02:30:05.920 align:start position:0%
dramatically rein in the rate of growth
 
02:30:08.070 --> 02:30:08.080 align:start position:0%
and personnel
 
02:30:10.389 --> 02:30:10.399 align:start position:0%
because it's not sustainable
 
02:30:12.150 --> 02:30:12.160 align:start position:0%
but do it in a way
 
02:30:14.230 --> 02:30:14.240 align:start position:0%
in which we protect
 
02:30:16.630 --> 02:30:16.640 align:start position:0%
the current employees we don't want to
 
02:30:18.389 --> 02:30:18.399 align:start position:0%
screw with their step increases their
 
02:30:20.790 --> 02:30:20.800 align:start position:0%
promotions we don't want to we don't
 
02:30:23.830 --> 02:30:23.840 align:start position:0%
want to stop uh vital hiring
 
02:30:23.840 --> 02:30:24.950 align:start position:0%
want to stop uh vital hiring
but

02:30:24.950 --> 02:30:24.960 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:30:28.150 --> 02:30:28.160 align:start position:0%
but at the same time we have to ask
 
02:30:28.160 --> 02:30:29.670 align:start position:0%
but at the same time we have to ask
management

02:30:29.670 --> 02:30:29.680 align:start position:0%
management
 
02:30:32.469 --> 02:30:32.479 align:start position:0%
that in the context of an economy that
 
02:30:34.790 --> 02:30:34.800 align:start position:0%
just got sucker punched and
 
02:30:36.389 --> 02:30:36.399 align:start position:0%
can we please
 
02:30:38.230 --> 02:30:38.240 align:start position:0%
tighten our belt
 
02:30:39.670 --> 02:30:39.680 align:start position:0%
the way
 
02:30:41.429 --> 02:30:41.439 align:start position:0%
businesses have had to tighten their
 
02:30:41.439 --> 02:30:42.389 align:start position:0%
businesses have had to tighten their
belt

02:30:42.389 --> 02:30:42.399 align:start position:0%
belt
 
02:30:44.389 --> 02:30:44.399 align:start position:0%
there are no businesses that i know of
 
02:30:46.389 --> 02:30:46.399 align:start position:0%
that are growing their personnel numbers
 
02:30:47.910 --> 02:30:47.920 align:start position:0%
at this rate
 
02:30:51.349 --> 02:30:51.359 align:start position:0%
and and i i have a hard time being part
 
02:30:53.510 --> 02:30:53.520 align:start position:0%
of a process that
 
02:30:53.520 --> 02:30:55.830 align:start position:0%
of a process that
allows

02:30:55.830 --> 02:30:55.840 align:start position:0%
allows
 
02:30:55.840 --> 02:30:56.710 align:start position:0%
allows
what

02:30:56.710 --> 02:30:56.720 align:start position:0%
what
 
02:30:58.469 --> 02:30:58.479 align:start position:0%
many people from the business world
 
02:31:00.550 --> 02:31:00.560 align:start position:0%
would consider to be
 
02:31:04.230 --> 02:31:04.240 align:start position:0%
an out-of-control personnel growth rate
 
02:31:07.190 --> 02:31:07.200 align:start position:0%
so so i'm trying to figure out how to
 
02:31:09.990 --> 02:31:10.000 align:start position:0%
balance this this this this macro
 
02:31:10.000 --> 02:31:11.110 align:start position:0%
balance this this this this macro
concern

02:31:11.110 --> 02:31:11.120 align:start position:0%
concern
 
02:31:13.670 --> 02:31:13.680 align:start position:0%
with the reality of the department
 
02:31:14.710 --> 02:31:14.720 align:start position:0%
because i don't want to break the
 
02:31:14.720 --> 02:31:16.150 align:start position:0%
because i don't want to break the
department

02:31:16.150 --> 02:31:16.160 align:start position:0%
department
 
02:31:20.870 --> 02:31:20.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:23.510 --> 02:31:23.520 align:start position:0%
and fully stating that i i don't support
 
02:31:25.349 --> 02:31:25.359 align:start position:0%
reducing any of our positions i i want
 
02:31:28.150 --> 02:31:28.160 align:start position:0%
to make that really clear but if you
 
02:31:28.160 --> 02:31:29.110 align:start position:0%
to make that really clear but if you
were

02:31:29.110 --> 02:31:29.120 align:start position:0%
were
 
02:31:30.630 --> 02:31:30.640 align:start position:0%
looking to
 
02:31:30.640 --> 02:31:31.910 align:start position:0%
looking to
um

02:31:31.910 --> 02:31:31.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:31:34.469 --> 02:31:34.479 align:start position:0%
to reduce the number of positions that
 
02:31:37.349 --> 02:31:37.359 align:start position:0%
and reduce the cost so it's about a
 
02:31:39.670 --> 02:31:39.680 align:start position:0%
hundred positions
 
02:31:41.670 --> 02:31:41.680 align:start position:0%
equals five million dollars in general
 
02:31:41.680 --> 02:31:42.389 align:start position:0%
equals five million dollars in general
funds

02:31:42.389 --> 02:31:42.399 align:start position:0%
funds
 
02:31:43.990 --> 02:31:44.000 align:start position:0%
now some people would want to break that
 
02:31:45.830 --> 02:31:45.840 align:start position:0%
down as one position as fifty thousand
 
02:31:48.070 --> 02:31:48.080 align:start position:0%
dollars but
 
02:31:49.590 --> 02:31:49.600 align:start position:0%
to really get to the five million it
 
02:31:51.429 --> 02:31:51.439 align:start position:0%
takes a hundred different positions
 
02:31:52.630 --> 02:31:52.640 align:start position:0%
right because
 
02:31:54.469 --> 02:31:54.479 align:start position:0%
cost allocation every position is a
 
02:31:56.469 --> 02:31:56.479 align:start position:0%
little bit different so i i wouldn't
 
02:31:59.110 --> 02:31:59.120 align:start position:0%
want to break that down to 50 000 per
 
02:32:01.190 --> 02:32:01.200 align:start position:0%
position but it's about 100 positions is
 
02:32:03.590 --> 02:32:03.600 align:start position:0%
5 million dollars in general funds so if
 
02:32:05.429 --> 02:32:05.439 align:start position:0%
you were looking to
 
02:32:05.439 --> 02:32:07.349 align:start position:0%
you were looking to
um

02:32:07.349 --> 02:32:07.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:32:08.870 --> 02:32:08.880 align:start position:0%
to reduce the number of positions in the
 
02:32:10.870 --> 02:32:10.880 align:start position:0%
department by 100 positions i'm just
 
02:32:13.030 --> 02:32:13.040 align:start position:0%
using that as an example you could put a
 
02:32:15.190 --> 02:32:15.200 align:start position:0%
provision in hb2 that says the
 
02:32:17.510 --> 02:32:17.520 align:start position:0%
department's personnel line personnel
 
02:32:19.190 --> 02:32:19.200 align:start position:0%
lines i should say because they could be
 
02:32:21.510 --> 02:32:21.520 align:start position:0%
salary or benefits
 
02:32:23.750 --> 02:32:23.760 align:start position:0%
shall be reduced by 5 million dollars
 
02:32:25.990 --> 02:32:26.000 align:start position:0%
during the biennium or
 
02:32:27.590 --> 02:32:27.600 align:start position:0%
it would 100 positions would be 10
 
02:32:29.110 --> 02:32:29.120 align:start position:0%
million for the biennium it's 5 million
 
02:32:29.990 --> 02:32:30.000 align:start position:0%
a year
 
02:32:30.000 --> 02:32:30.950 align:start position:0%
a year
um

02:32:30.950 --> 02:32:30.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:32:32.389 --> 02:32:32.399 align:start position:0%
so you could do something like that
 
02:32:33.590 --> 02:32:33.600 align:start position:0%
which would then allow us the
 
02:32:35.429 --> 02:32:35.439 align:start position:0%
flexibility to
 
02:32:37.270 --> 02:32:37.280 align:start position:0%
manage within
 
02:32:39.349 --> 02:32:39.359 align:start position:0%
a cost
 
02:32:42.550 --> 02:32:42.560 align:start position:0%
and not have as many positions filled at
 
02:32:44.870 --> 02:32:44.880 align:start position:0%
any one time
 
02:32:47.190 --> 02:32:47.200 align:start position:0%
that would also save the lba from having
 
02:32:49.990 --> 02:32:50.000 align:start position:0%
to go in and key a lot of lines
 
02:32:52.550 --> 02:32:52.560 align:start position:0%
of information so uh mr ripple can you
 
02:32:54.870 --> 02:32:54.880 align:start position:0%
scroll down oh no that's right already
 
02:32:59.870 --> 02:32:59.880 align:start position:0%
there so it's just really faint um on
 
02:32:59.880 --> 02:33:01.429 align:start position:0%
there so it's just really faint um on
7937

02:33:01.429 --> 02:33:01.439 align:start position:0%
7937
 
02:33:03.750 --> 02:33:03.760 align:start position:0%
permanent unclassified
 
02:33:06.950 --> 02:33:06.960 align:start position:0%
is is 28 um
 
02:33:09.030 --> 02:33:09.040 align:start position:0%
and i guess that's on um
 
02:33:11.110 --> 02:33:11.120 align:start position:0%
are we looking at representative earth's
 
02:33:11.120 --> 02:33:12.309 align:start position:0%
are we looking at representative earth's
worksheet

02:33:12.309 --> 02:33:12.319 align:start position:0%
worksheet
 
02:33:12.319 --> 02:33:13.510 align:start position:0%
worksheet
yes

02:33:13.510 --> 02:33:13.520 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:33:13.520 --> 02:33:14.710 align:start position:0%
yes
okay

02:33:14.710 --> 02:33:14.720 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:33:14.720 --> 02:33:16.790 align:start position:0%
okay
so

02:33:16.790 --> 02:33:16.800 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:33:18.950 --> 02:33:18.960 align:start position:0%
i would also like to
 
02:33:21.510 --> 02:33:21.520 align:start position:0%
be able to cause some of these lines to
 
02:33:24.790 --> 02:33:24.800 align:start position:0%
be keyed so that they get reduced
 
02:33:27.270 --> 02:33:27.280 align:start position:0%
so that we maintain
 
02:33:29.270 --> 02:33:29.280 align:start position:0%
a baseline somewhere
 
02:33:31.110 --> 02:33:31.120 align:start position:0%
there's got to be a baseline
 
02:33:35.670 --> 02:33:35.680 align:start position:0%
whether it's 19 or 21 i you know i like
 
02:33:37.830 --> 02:33:37.840 align:start position:0%
i said my goal isn't to break things but
 
02:33:40.150 --> 02:33:40.160 align:start position:0%
my goal is to represent the taxpayers
 
02:33:40.160 --> 02:33:41.429 align:start position:0%
my goal is to represent the taxpayers
interests

02:33:41.429 --> 02:33:41.439 align:start position:0%
interests
 
02:33:43.429 --> 02:33:43.439 align:start position:0%
in having the management of department
 
02:33:45.349 --> 02:33:45.359 align:start position:0%
of health and human services
 
02:33:47.270 --> 02:33:47.280 align:start position:0%
accept the business realities of the
 
02:33:50.070 --> 02:33:50.080 align:start position:0%
underlying economy that pays the bills
 
02:33:52.790 --> 02:33:52.800 align:start position:0%
and we need to we we can't allow
 
02:33:54.469 --> 02:33:54.479 align:start position:0%
personnel growth at this rate it just
 
02:33:57.990 --> 02:33:58.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:00.309 --> 02:34:00.319 align:start position:0%
could you could force that in the hb2
 
02:34:04.150 --> 02:34:04.160 align:start position:0%
language and say that we must reduce the
 
02:34:08.309 --> 02:34:08.319 align:start position:0%
class lines in the appropriation
 
02:34:10.630 --> 02:34:10.640 align:start position:0%
all right so then when you come back for
 
02:34:13.830 --> 02:34:13.840 align:start position:0%
24 25 those reductions would be
 
02:34:16.389 --> 02:34:16.399 align:start position:0%
represented in the class lines we would
 
02:34:17.990 --> 02:34:18.000 align:start position:0%
go through the we would go through and
 
02:34:19.349 --> 02:34:19.359 align:start position:0%
tell department of administrative
 
02:34:22.070 --> 02:34:22.080 align:start position:0%
services where to make reductions
 
02:34:24.070 --> 02:34:24.080 align:start position:0%
because a lot can happen between now and
 
02:34:25.750 --> 02:34:25.760 align:start position:0%
june too which is the other thing that
 
02:34:27.670 --> 02:34:27.680 align:start position:0%
makes me a little nervous about reducing
 
02:34:30.309 --> 02:34:30.319 align:start position:0%
class lines in particular areas that the
 
02:34:32.309 --> 02:34:32.319 align:start position:0%
decision we might say today well if
 
02:34:34.070 --> 02:34:34.080 align:start position:0%
you're telling us we have to unfund this
 
02:34:36.070 --> 02:34:36.080 align:start position:0%
i would do it here might be a little
 
02:34:37.990 --> 02:34:38.000 align:start position:0%
different four months from now
 
02:34:40.070 --> 02:34:40.080 align:start position:0%
that's an excellent point
 
02:34:43.830 --> 02:34:43.840 align:start position:0%
so if if you wouldn't mind
 
02:34:45.910 --> 02:34:45.920 align:start position:0%
some language around that
 
02:34:47.670 --> 02:34:47.680 align:start position:0%
and sharing it with us
 
02:34:49.590 --> 02:34:49.600 align:start position:0%
then i think
 
02:34:53.349 --> 02:34:53.359 align:start position:0%
you would be fulfilling the role of
 
02:34:55.190 --> 02:34:55.200 align:start position:0%
helping me so i don't
 
02:34:57.270 --> 02:34:57.280 align:start position:0%
for us so that we don't break the
 
02:34:57.280 --> 02:34:58.389 align:start position:0%
for us so that we don't break the
department

02:34:58.389 --> 02:34:58.399 align:start position:0%
department
 
02:35:00.870 --> 02:35:00.880 align:start position:0%
but but that we do we do something to
 
02:35:03.590 --> 02:35:03.600 align:start position:0%
put some personnel controls in place
 
02:35:05.510 --> 02:35:05.520 align:start position:0%
i don't think anyone
 
02:35:07.349 --> 02:35:07.359 align:start position:0%
view you as a trader for doing that
 
02:35:08.870 --> 02:35:08.880 align:start position:0%
because you're on the record of saying
 
02:35:11.190 --> 02:35:11.200 align:start position:0%
you don't support any of these cuts
 
02:35:13.670 --> 02:35:13.680 align:start position:0%
and i i would um i'll work with kevin on
 
02:35:15.830 --> 02:35:15.840 align:start position:0%
that and i would just say that it won't
 
02:35:18.070 --> 02:35:18.080 align:start position:0%
break the department from a financial
 
02:35:19.910 --> 02:35:19.920 align:start position:0%
management point of view but the
 
02:35:21.349 --> 02:35:21.359 align:start position:0%
commissioner would absolutely say that
 
02:35:22.630 --> 02:35:22.640 align:start position:0%
it would break the department from being
 
02:35:24.870 --> 02:35:24.880 align:start position:0%
able to run it effectively
 
02:35:26.950 --> 02:35:26.960 align:start position:0%
i understand i never ran into a
 
02:35:28.550 --> 02:35:28.560 align:start position:0%
subordinate commander who didn't think
 
02:35:30.950 --> 02:35:30.960 align:start position:0%
they needed more people to do something
 
02:35:30.960 --> 02:35:32.309 align:start position:0%
they needed more people to do something
so

02:35:32.309 --> 02:35:32.319 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:35:35.830 --> 02:35:35.840 align:start position:0%
um so rep representative walner i think
 
02:35:39.670 --> 02:35:39.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:43.990 --> 02:35:44.000 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you so just to go back to
 
02:35:44.000 --> 02:35:45.270 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you so just to go back to
this

02:35:45.270 --> 02:35:45.280 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:35:45.280 --> 02:35:46.790 align:start position:0%
this
area

02:35:46.790 --> 02:35:46.800 align:start position:0%
area
 
02:35:49.910 --> 02:35:49.920 align:start position:0%
so i i'm looking at this and um i have a
 
02:35:51.910 --> 02:35:51.920 align:start position:0%
note to myself here
 
02:35:51.920 --> 02:35:52.830 align:start position:0%
note to myself here
that

02:35:52.830 --> 02:35:52.840 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:35:54.870 --> 02:35:54.880 align:start position:0%
um class
 
02:35:58.070 --> 02:35:58.080 align:start position:0%
the transfer to other state agencies
 
02:36:01.270 --> 02:36:01.280 align:start position:0%
here is a transfer to new hampshire
 
02:36:01.280 --> 02:36:03.190 align:start position:0%
here is a transfer to new hampshire
hospital

02:36:03.190 --> 02:36:03.200 align:start position:0%
hospital
 
02:36:05.750 --> 02:36:05.760 align:start position:0%
and first i assume that new hampshire
 
02:36:08.469 --> 02:36:08.479 align:start position:0%
hospital has earned
 
02:36:11.910 --> 02:36:11.920 align:start position:0%
this amount of medicaid
 
02:36:11.920 --> 02:36:13.510 align:start position:0%
this amount of medicaid
funding

02:36:13.510 --> 02:36:13.520 align:start position:0%
funding
 
02:36:16.230 --> 02:36:16.240 align:start position:0%
and yet because the way the document is
 
02:36:17.510 --> 02:36:17.520 align:start position:0%
you is
 
02:36:17.520 --> 02:36:18.710 align:start position:0%
you is
designed

02:36:18.710 --> 02:36:18.720 align:start position:0%
designed
 
02:36:20.550 --> 02:36:20.560 align:start position:0%
we use a
 
02:36:22.630 --> 02:36:22.640 align:start position:0%
much less
 
02:36:26.630 --> 02:36:26.640 align:start position:0%
um line to fund them i mean it goes from
 
02:36:26.640 --> 02:36:27.750 align:start position:0%
um line to fund them i mean it goes from
actually

02:36:27.750 --> 02:36:27.760 align:start position:0%
actually
 
02:36:30.150 --> 02:36:30.160 align:start position:0%
34 million in the governor's budget and
 
02:36:33.270 --> 02:36:33.280 align:start position:0%
then 36 in the in the 23
 
02:36:36.309 --> 02:36:36.319 align:start position:0%
down to 20 to new hampshire hospital i
 
02:36:38.150 --> 02:36:38.160 align:start position:0%
mean what
 
02:36:40.550 --> 02:36:40.560 align:start position:0%
what does that what kind of a
 
02:36:42.309 --> 02:36:42.319 align:start position:0%
what kind of an error is that going to
 
02:36:47.750 --> 02:36:47.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:50.550 --> 02:36:50.560 align:start position:0%
that is a class line that is 100 federal
 
02:36:53.429 --> 02:36:53.439 align:start position:0%
funds i did submit a change request to
 
02:36:56.550 --> 02:36:56.560 align:start position:0%
reduce it a little bit because it is
 
02:36:58.550 --> 02:36:58.560 align:start position:0%
it is a little bit too high to match to
 
02:37:01.349 --> 02:37:01.359 align:start position:0%
what new hampshire hospital budgeted
 
02:37:01.359 --> 02:37:02.389 align:start position:0%
what new hampshire hospital budgeted
but

02:37:02.389 --> 02:37:02.399 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:37:04.950 --> 02:37:04.960 align:start position:0%
we if that line was reduced below where
 
02:37:06.309 --> 02:37:06.319 align:start position:0%
it needed to be i would have to go to
 
02:37:07.670 --> 02:37:07.680 align:start position:0%
fiscal committee and accept the
 
02:37:09.590 --> 02:37:09.600 align:start position:0%
additional federal funds to transfer to
 
02:37:12.870 --> 02:37:12.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:13.990 --> 02:37:14.000 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
02:37:15.750 --> 02:37:15.760 align:start position:0%
that's outside of what we're working on
 
02:37:17.510 --> 02:37:17.520 align:start position:0%
today i don't think we're messing with
 
02:37:19.910 --> 02:37:19.920 align:start position:0%
federal funds
 
02:37:22.389 --> 02:37:22.399 align:start position:0%
but all of this i mean to me in my mind
 
02:37:24.070 --> 02:37:24.080 align:start position:0%
all of this
 
02:37:28.230 --> 02:37:28.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:29.750 --> 02:37:29.760 align:start position:0%
it's because when you get down to the
 
02:37:31.190 --> 02:37:31.200 align:start position:0%
bottom and you you're looking the
 
02:37:33.750 --> 02:37:33.760 align:start position:0%
federal funds are going to drop
 
02:37:36.630 --> 02:37:36.640 align:start position:0%
to 28 million
 
02:37:37.990 --> 02:37:38.000 align:start position:0%
when the
 
02:37:41.990 --> 02:37:42.000 align:start position:0%
general funds dropped to 5 million in 22
 
02:37:44.070 --> 02:37:44.080 align:start position:0%
and then
 
02:37:46.070 --> 02:37:46.080 align:start position:0%
let's bring representative irf in here
 
02:37:48.389 --> 02:37:48.399 align:start position:0%
because he's been he's been working on
 
02:37:50.550 --> 02:37:50.560 align:start position:0%
these lines too and i'd be interested in
 
02:37:54.150 --> 02:37:54.160 align:start position:0%
what what he has to say about it
 
02:37:55.270 --> 02:37:55.280 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:37:58.550 --> 02:37:58.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:01.830 --> 02:38:01.840 align:start position:0%
a lot of this discussion is moot
 
02:38:04.070 --> 02:38:04.080 align:start position:0%
for the following reasons
 
02:38:05.990 --> 02:38:06.000 align:start position:0%
i've been waiting karen to speak
 
02:38:07.590 --> 02:38:07.600 align:start position:0%
directly with you
 
02:38:09.110 --> 02:38:09.120 align:start position:0%
i'm well aware
 
02:38:11.110 --> 02:38:11.120 align:start position:0%
of these issues in fact i've gone
 
02:38:11.120 --> 02:38:11.910 align:start position:0%
of these issues in fact i've gone
through

02:38:11.910 --> 02:38:11.920 align:start position:0%
through
 
02:38:13.590 --> 02:38:13.600 align:start position:0%
the document you provided us that shows
 
02:38:15.910 --> 02:38:15.920 align:start position:0%
line by line general fund federal fund
 
02:38:17.590 --> 02:38:17.600 align:start position:0%
kind of breakdowns and in some cases
 
02:38:20.389 --> 02:38:20.399 align:start position:0%
i've actually applied them
 
02:38:22.950 --> 02:38:22.960 align:start position:0%
the suggestion you just made regarding
 
02:38:22.960 --> 02:38:24.309 align:start position:0%
the suggestion you just made regarding
the

02:38:24.309 --> 02:38:24.319 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:38:26.630 --> 02:38:26.640 align:start position:0%
wages if you tell me what class lines
 
02:38:27.910 --> 02:38:27.920 align:start position:0%
they are in other words it's not
 
02:38:29.990 --> 02:38:30.000 align:start position:0%
obviously it's not just 10 and 12 but
 
02:38:31.190 --> 02:38:31.200 align:start position:0%
the the
 
02:38:33.990 --> 02:38:34.000 align:start position:0%
the benefits and all that kind of thing
 
02:38:35.429 --> 02:38:35.439 align:start position:0%
i can go through and make all those
 
02:38:38.070 --> 02:38:38.080 align:start position:0%
adjustments and then we'll know exactly
 
02:38:40.150 --> 02:38:40.160 align:start position:0%
what the total is the total differential
 
02:38:40.160 --> 02:38:41.110 align:start position:0%
what the total is the total differential
is

02:38:41.110 --> 02:38:41.120 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:38:43.270 --> 02:38:43.280 align:start position:0%
and then we could say yes um we need to
 
02:38:45.590 --> 02:38:45.600 align:start position:0%
reduce 50 positions 100 positions
 
02:38:47.590 --> 02:38:47.600 align:start position:0%
whatever the number may be
 
02:38:50.630 --> 02:38:50.640 align:start position:0%
with regard to the point that um
 
02:38:52.790 --> 02:38:52.800 align:start position:0%
representative walling just brought up
 
02:38:53.990 --> 02:38:54.000 align:start position:0%
again that's something else that would
 
02:38:56.230 --> 02:38:56.240 align:start position:0%
automatically change this was never
 
02:38:58.469 --> 02:38:58.479 align:start position:0%
intended to be
 
02:39:00.870 --> 02:39:00.880 align:start position:0%
a budget it's not a budget
 
02:39:02.550 --> 02:39:02.560 align:start position:0%
it's a it's it's a place where we're
 
02:39:04.230 --> 02:39:04.240 align:start position:0%
going to where it was easy for me to add
 
02:39:05.670 --> 02:39:05.680 align:start position:0%
things back in and all the things that
 
02:39:06.950 --> 02:39:06.960 align:start position:0%
we've talked about this morning that
 
02:39:06.960 --> 02:39:08.150 align:start position:0%
we've talked about this morning that
representative

02:39:08.150 --> 02:39:08.160 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:39:10.950 --> 02:39:10.960 align:start position:0%
excuse me mr chairman has brought up
 
02:39:12.790 --> 02:39:12.800 align:start position:0%
have been added back in so we can see
 
02:39:14.870 --> 02:39:14.880 align:start position:0%
those totals and i can do that
 
02:39:16.950 --> 02:39:16.960 align:start position:0%
progressively when you have time karen i
 
02:39:18.389 --> 02:39:18.399 align:start position:0%
would love to uh
 
02:39:21.910 --> 02:39:21.920 align:start position:0%
representative i mean uh miss rounds um
 
02:39:23.429 --> 02:39:23.439 align:start position:0%
i would love to start with you and again
 
02:39:24.550 --> 02:39:24.560 align:start position:0%
because i can make these kinds of
 
02:39:29.990 --> 02:39:30.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:33.190 --> 02:39:33.200 align:start position:0%
so probably we could go back to the uh
 
02:39:35.030 --> 02:39:35.040 align:start position:0%
the governor's budget instead of
 
02:39:37.910 --> 02:39:37.920 align:start position:0%
representative erf's uh working document
 
02:39:39.270 --> 02:39:39.280 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:39:41.830 --> 02:39:41.840 align:start position:0%
um so uh
 
02:39:43.590 --> 02:39:43.600 align:start position:0%
representative weiler you've had your
 
02:39:46.790 --> 02:39:46.800 align:start position:0%
hand up for quite a while sir
 
02:39:48.870 --> 02:39:48.880 align:start position:0%
yes thank you um
 
02:39:50.870 --> 02:39:50.880 align:start position:0%
i don't remember before seeing in all
 
02:39:53.349 --> 02:39:53.359 align:start position:0%
these budgets all this additional fringe
 
02:39:54.870 --> 02:39:54.880 align:start position:0%
benefits now the
 
02:39:57.110 --> 02:39:57.120 align:start position:0%
the benefits are already a seat
 
02:39:59.830 --> 02:39:59.840 align:start position:0%
getting close to 60 70 percent of the of
 
02:40:02.309 --> 02:40:02.319 align:start position:0%
the wages and if this is this just an
 
02:40:03.510 --> 02:40:03.520 align:start position:0%
excuse to
 
02:40:05.030 --> 02:40:05.040 align:start position:0%
hide the fact they might be at 80
 
02:40:07.510 --> 02:40:07.520 align:start position:0%
percent what are additional fringe
 
02:40:08.950 --> 02:40:08.960 align:start position:0%
benefits we never used to see them in
 
02:40:11.349 --> 02:40:11.359 align:start position:0%
the budget now i see it every line thank
 
02:40:11.359 --> 02:40:13.429 align:start position:0%
the budget now i see it every line thank
you

02:40:13.429 --> 02:40:13.439 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:40:15.990 --> 02:40:16.000 align:start position:0%
you want to address that ms rounds kevin
 
02:40:17.590 --> 02:40:17.600 align:start position:0%
could you bring over michelle carraway
 
02:40:20.630 --> 02:40:20.640 align:start position:0%
maybe to explain it from das sure you
 
02:40:22.630 --> 02:40:22.640 align:start position:0%
know let's let's do it this way it's
 
02:40:24.469 --> 02:40:24.479 align:start position:0%
it's 2 11.
 
02:40:24.479 --> 02:40:25.269 align:start position:0%
it's 2 11.
um

02:40:25.269 --> 02:40:25.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:40:27.110 --> 02:40:27.120 align:start position:0%
we're we're kind of at a good spot to
 
02:40:28.710 --> 02:40:28.720 align:start position:0%
break for lunch
 
02:40:30.870 --> 02:40:30.880 align:start position:0%
so so let's do that at one o'clock if
 
02:40:32.070 --> 02:40:32.080 align:start position:0%
you wouldn't mind
 
02:40:33.990 --> 02:40:34.000 align:start position:0%
uh representative walter do you have a
 
02:40:37.190 --> 02:40:37.200 align:start position:0%
question or comment before we go
 
02:40:37.200 --> 02:40:38.309 align:start position:0%
question or comment before we go
okay

02:40:38.309 --> 02:40:38.319 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:40:38.319 --> 02:40:39.429 align:start position:0%
okay
yes

02:40:39.429 --> 02:40:39.439 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:40:42.150 --> 02:40:42.160 align:start position:0%
so um because i sense that that may be a
 
02:40:44.870 --> 02:40:44.880 align:start position:0%
longer conversation and a good one let's
 
02:40:47.190 --> 02:40:47.200 align:start position:0%
let's uh use it to start the uh at one
 
02:40:47.200 --> 02:40:49.190 align:start position:0%
let's uh use it to start the uh at one
o'clock

02:40:49.190 --> 02:40:49.200 align:start position:0%
o'clock
 
02:40:50.950 --> 02:40:50.960 align:start position:0%
so i are with you representative weiler
 
02:40:50.960 --> 02:40:53.670 align:start position:0%
so i are with you representative weiler
sir

02:40:53.670 --> 02:40:53.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:53.680 --> 02:40:55.030 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:40:55.030 --> 02:40:55.040 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:40:57.750 --> 02:40:57.760 align:start position:0%
all right so um
 
02:40:59.910 --> 02:40:59.920 align:start position:0%
is there anything that you need to say
 
02:41:01.910 --> 02:41:01.920 align:start position:0%
or want to say here ms rounds
 
02:41:03.670 --> 02:41:03.680 align:start position:0%
before we lose our train of thought is
 
02:41:05.110 --> 02:41:05.120 align:start position:0%
there something that you've got on the
 
02:41:06.870 --> 02:41:06.880 align:start position:0%
tip of your tongue
 
02:41:09.830 --> 02:41:09.840 align:start position:0%
i don't i don't think so i i
 
02:41:11.750 --> 02:41:11.760 align:start position:0%
i guess i would say to uh representative
 
02:41:14.630 --> 02:41:14.640 align:start position:0%
ruff about your request to sit down i i
 
02:41:16.150 --> 02:41:16.160 align:start position:0%
we would definitely need to schedule
 
02:41:18.309 --> 02:41:18.319 align:start position:0%
time and i would need to have probably
 
02:41:20.230 --> 02:41:20.240 align:start position:0%
all of my finance directors part of that
 
02:41:21.590 --> 02:41:21.600 align:start position:0%
meeting because there are things in
 
02:41:23.990 --> 02:41:24.000 align:start position:0%
every accounting unit that are really
 
02:41:26.790 --> 02:41:26.800 align:start position:0%
specific that i don't necessarily know
 
02:41:26.800 --> 02:41:27.670 align:start position:0%
specific that i don't necessarily know
so

02:41:27.670 --> 02:41:27.680 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:41:32.309 --> 02:41:32.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:34.870 --> 02:41:34.880 align:start position:0%
so if if if you
 
02:41:37.590 --> 02:41:37.600 align:start position:0%
um could work on some language how long
 
02:41:39.830 --> 02:41:39.840 align:start position:0%
would it take you to come up with some
 
02:41:42.630 --> 02:41:42.640 align:start position:0%
hp2 language that might
 
02:41:44.630 --> 02:41:44.640 align:start position:0%
get most of what i'm looking for which
 
02:41:47.269 --> 02:41:47.279 align:start position:0%
is some sort of a personnel ceiling
 
02:41:49.510 --> 02:41:49.520 align:start position:0%
uh that's lower than what's
 
02:41:49.520 --> 02:41:51.190 align:start position:0%
uh that's lower than what's
projected

02:41:51.190 --> 02:41:51.200 align:start position:0%
projected
 
02:41:52.469 --> 02:41:52.479 align:start position:0%
i don't i don't think that would take
 
02:41:54.309 --> 02:41:54.319 align:start position:0%
long i defer to kevin but i don't think
 
02:41:55.590 --> 02:41:55.600 align:start position:0%
it'll take long
 
02:41:57.030 --> 02:41:57.040 align:start position:0%
we should be able to get you something
 
02:41:59.910 --> 02:41:59.920 align:start position:0%
by the end of the day today
 
02:42:01.349 --> 02:42:01.359 align:start position:0%
let's let's think that we're going to
 
02:42:04.870 --> 02:42:04.880 align:start position:0%
talk about it tomorrow then please okay
 
02:42:06.950 --> 02:42:06.960 align:start position:0%
representative earth your hand is up
 
02:42:09.990 --> 02:42:10.000 align:start position:0%
it's 2 13. you got 120 seconds this will
 
02:42:11.110 --> 02:42:11.120 align:start position:0%
be very quick
 
02:42:12.870 --> 02:42:12.880 align:start position:0%
miss rounds i understand that if you
 
02:42:14.469 --> 02:42:14.479 align:start position:0%
could i know you could quickly give me
 
02:42:15.990 --> 02:42:16.000 align:start position:0%
the basic class lines if you just tell
 
02:42:17.670 --> 02:42:17.680 align:start position:0%
me what those are i can get going i
 
02:42:19.190 --> 02:42:19.200 align:start position:0%
realize that's not the full answer that
 
02:42:22.469 --> 02:42:22.479 align:start position:0%
would okay that's part way there uh 10
 
02:42:22.479 --> 02:42:24.830 align:start position:0%
would okay that's part way there uh 10
11

02:42:24.830 --> 02:42:24.840 align:start position:0%
11
 
02:42:29.670 --> 02:42:29.680 align:start position:0%
12 17 18 19
 
02:42:35.269 --> 02:42:35.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:37.590 --> 02:42:37.600 align:start position:0%
okay and does the
 
02:42:39.429 --> 02:42:39.439 align:start position:0%
does the gff
 
02:42:41.670 --> 02:42:41.680 align:start position:0%
match vary from line to from person to
 
02:42:43.750 --> 02:42:43.760 align:start position:0%
from account to account

sign mr ripple that will be back at one
 
02:43:01.910 --> 02:43:01.920 align:start position:0%
o'clock and turn off the recording uh
 
02:43:03.590 --> 02:43:03.600 align:start position:0%
then that would be great
 
02:43:04.790 --> 02:43:04.800 align:start position:0%
i will
