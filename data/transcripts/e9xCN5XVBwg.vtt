00:00:59.790 --> 00:00:59.800 align:start position:0%
everybody we're meeting here because um
 
00:01:02.189 --> 00:01:02.199 align:start position:0%
when we've heard Senate Bill 485 last
 
00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 align:start position:0%
week we noticed that it was remarkably
 
00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 align:start position:0%
similar to House Bill
 
00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:09.680 align:start position:0%
1385 so the objective of uh the meeting
 
00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:13.240 align:start position:0%
is to look to see what we need to do to
 
00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:16.720 align:start position:0%
make to to Senate Bill 485 to to make it
 
00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 align:start position:0%
harmonious with Senate bill with House
 
00:01:22.749 --> 00:01:22.759 align:start position:0%
Bill 1385 or
 
00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:27.200 align:start position:0%
um oop sorry if Senate Bill uh 485 is
 
00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:30.680 align:start position:0%
needed at all in light of house bill
 
00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 align:start position:0%
1385 so um representative Carol would
 
00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 align:start position:0%
you like to um discuss what you the
 
00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 align:start position:0%
analogy the the comparisons that you
 
00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:43.479 align:start position:0%
made on both the bills uh thank you sure
 
00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:46.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:47.910 align:start position:0%
 
everybody

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:47.920 align:start position:0%
everybody
 
00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:51.040 align:start position:0%
uh so let's see I don't know if
 
00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 align:start position:0%
everybody has a copy of
 
00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:58.000 align:start position:0%
each um of the amendment to 1385 which
 
00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:02.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 align:start position:0%
I got one we can share and is that
 
00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 align:start position:0%
Amendment did that replace the bill in
 
00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 align:start position:0%
its entirety yes
 
00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 align:start position:0%
okay um and that's what we voted on here
 
00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:17.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:19.869 --> 00:02:19.879 align:start position:0%
485 so I I think that the short
 
00:02:21.509 --> 00:02:21.519 align:start position:0%
explanation is there's a number of
 
00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:26.200 align:start position:0%
changes that we made in uh uh 1385 in
 
00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:28.280 align:start position:0%
the amendment that were at the
 
00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:30.640 align:start position:0%
suggestion of oplc and
 
00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 align:start position:0%
DMV uh clarifying language to go along
 
00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 align:start position:0%
with all the changes that you folks have
 
00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.040 align:start position:0%
made in the past few years and some
 
00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:42.440 align:start position:0%
language to make sure that active that
 
00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:45.680 align:start position:0%
that people transitioning that we made
 
00:02:47.309 --> 00:02:47.319 align:start position:0%
sure put the word veterans in there to
 
00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 align:start position:0%
make sure that that was clear and not
 
00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:52.040 align:start position:0%
just spouses so most of that is what
 
00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:55.400 align:start position:0%
this is as as a uh uh looking from the
 
00:02:58.270 --> 00:02:58.280 align:start position:0%
30,000 foot view um I think the main
 
00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 align:start position:0%
piece of 485 was at the senator was
 
00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:02.640 align:start position:0%
looking for the digitally
 
00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:04.670 align:start position:0%
looking for the digitally
verifiable

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 align:start position:0%
verifiable
 
00:03:07.789 --> 00:03:07.799 align:start position:0%
um licensing piece and and there's an
 
00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:09.360 align:start position:0%
entire paragraph of the back that was
 
00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:12.840 align:start position:0%
added that I think oplc and DMV should
 
00:03:16.309 --> 00:03:16.319 align:start position:0%
put in for should put in the comment on
 
00:03:18.509 --> 00:03:18.519 align:start position:0%
so with that said I don't know if you
 
00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:20.000 align:start position:0%
want me to kind of go if it makes sense
 
00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:22.080 align:start position:0%
just to go through it a little bit line
 
00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:26.680 align:start position:0%
at a time so do we
 
00:03:30.509 --> 00:03:30.519 align:start position:0%
um uh you're welcome to to use that that
 
00:03:34.149 --> 00:03:34.159 align:start position:0%
waren if if you want to and I didn't
 
00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:36.959 align:start position:0%
have any extra copies of 1385 my
 
00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:40.920 align:start position:0%
apologies for that but so going down
 
00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:43.840 align:start position:0%
this little uh comparison sheet so on
 
00:03:47.869 --> 00:03:47.879 align:start position:0%
1385 on the amendment page one in its
 
00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:50.920 align:start position:0%
entirety isn't addressed in 485 because
 
00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:53.840 align:start position:0%
it's all new material that we put in so
 
00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:56.200 align:start position:0%
there's no change needed on 1090 and
 
00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:57.840 align:start position:0%
it's not
 
00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:00.400 align:start position:0%
relevant um on page
 
00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:02.680 align:start position:0%
1385 just a moment I just want to make
 
00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:06.760 align:start position:0%
sure so um we don't have any say in 1090
 
00:04:09.509 --> 00:04:09.519 align:start position:0%
anymore because it's gone to the Senate
 
00:04:11.229 --> 00:04:11.239 align:start position:0%
but do we the fact that it's not
 
00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:16.280 align:start position:0%
addressed in Senate Bill 485 is that an
 
00:04:19.349 --> 00:04:19.359 align:start position:0%
issue um those first two lines are not
 
00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:20.110 align:start position:0%
issue um those first two lines are not
an

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:20.120 align:start position:0%
an
 
00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:23.080 align:start position:0%
issue because 485 doesn't address any of
 
00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:25.720 align:start position:0%
that okay and is that something then
 
00:04:27.749 --> 00:04:27.759 align:start position:0%
that okay that's fine okay so we don't
 
00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:30.840 align:start position:0%
need to do anything okay uh um on 1385
 
00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:34.320 align:start position:0%
in page two the changes that we made in
 
00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:36.320 align:start position:0%
the title added veterans and it removed
 
00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:37.680 align:start position:0%
the words temporary
 
00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:40.600 align:start position:0%
license and I would think that that
 
00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:44.320 align:start position:0%
should also be reflected in 485 if I'm
 
00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:45.720 align:start position:0%
understanding the process correctly and
 
00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:48.560 align:start position:0%
certainly director Courtney can jump in
 
00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:50.000 align:start position:0%
but I think that those were changes
 
00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:53.800 align:start position:0%
suggested by oplc and dmav to make our
 
00:04:57.230 --> 00:04:57.240 align:start position:0%
our bill make sense so I would say that
 
00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:00.160 align:start position:0%
what's on page two line 8 in 138 5
 
00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:04.000 align:start position:0%
should be put into 485 if that's the
 
00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:06.280 align:start position:0%
process okay does anybody does anybody
 
00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:08.600 align:start position:0%
have any comments on
 
00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:10.880 align:start position:0%
that yeah I would agree with that
 
00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:13.230 align:start position:0%
that yeah I would agree with that
representative

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:13.240 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:16.800 align:start position:0%
okay the next line down again similar
 
00:05:19.189 --> 00:05:19.199 align:start position:0%
changes that were were suggested by OPC
 
00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:20.600 align:start position:0%
I think clarifying
 
00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:23.440 align:start position:0%
language um
 
00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:26.080 align:start position:0%
uh words were added as you can see under
 
00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:29.000 align:start position:0%
RC 45a and the word the' was added to
 
00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:30.960 align:start position:0%
make a make the sentence
 
00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:34.120 align:start position:0%
grammatically more proper and it deleted
 
00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:35.800 align:start position:0%
the words of the officer of professional
 
00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:38.160 align:start position:0%
licenser and certification because we
 
00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:41.960 align:start position:0%
changed that globally across all of our
 
00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:44.560 align:start position:0%
bills so I believe those changes should
 
00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:46.960 align:start position:0%
be put into 485 as
 
00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:49.469 align:start position:0%
be put into 485 as
well

00:05:49.469 --> 00:05:49.479 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:52.600 align:start position:0%
okay any comments you're good everybody
 
00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:55.240 align:start position:0%
good okay I think my only comment would
 
00:05:58.629 --> 00:05:58.639 align:start position:0%
be that I think the language that's in
 
00:05:58.639 --> 00:06:00.510 align:start position:0%
be that I think the language that's in
31016

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:00.520 align:start position:0%
31016
 
00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:03.400 align:start position:0%
um at least one and we can talk about
 
00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:06.160 align:start position:0%
the other Roman numerals but I think the
 
00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:09.000 align:start position:0%
language that's in
 
00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:11.800 align:start position:0%
1385 is probably the language that we
 
00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:14.840 align:start position:0%
want to keep whether or not it be moved
 
00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:17.120 align:start position:0%
over to 485 or whether it just be taken
 
00:06:20.909 --> 00:06:20.919 align:start position:0%
out of 485 and we rely on 13 95 however
 
00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:22.840 align:start position:0%
we want to do that I think that's the
 
00:06:25.589 --> 00:06:25.599 align:start position:0%
language that the office would
 
00:06:29.189 --> 00:06:29.199 align:start position:0%
like okay it's just minored yep that's
 
00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:31.240 align:start position:0%
fine that's fine right and and I don't
 
00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:33.880 align:start position:0%
know enough about how this works to know
 
00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:36.800 align:start position:0%
so right what we had in 1385 I think we
 
00:06:38.589 --> 00:06:38.599 align:start position:0%
want to keep whether we have to put that
 
00:06:41.469 --> 00:06:41.479 align:start position:0%
in 485 or in the long run it changes the
 
00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:43.720 align:start position:0%
law when they're both done it changes
 
00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:46.120 align:start position:0%
the law regardless right right so up
 
00:06:49.629 --> 00:06:49.639 align:start position:0%
until now what I my sense is that
 
00:06:52.629 --> 00:06:52.639 align:start position:0%
there's nothing that's in 485 that is
 
00:06:54.950 --> 00:06:54.960 align:start position:0%
not in
 
00:07:00.909 --> 00:07:00.919 align:start position:0%
1385 as amended and that 1385 as amended
 
00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:04.240 align:start position:0%
represents the latest version of is that
 
00:07:07.150 --> 00:07:07.160 align:start position:0%
are we all in agreement with
 
00:07:10.950 --> 00:07:10.960 align:start position:0%
that okay so if if you want me to jump
 
00:07:15.350 --> 00:07:15.360 align:start position:0%
to where I think there's a conflict yes
 
00:07:19.189 --> 00:07:19.199 align:start position:0%
um uh can I just you may
 
00:07:23.110 --> 00:07:23.120 align:start position:0%
yeah just so uh can think about the
 
00:07:25.110 --> 00:07:25.120 align:start position:0%
direction we're we're
 
00:07:27.909 --> 00:07:27.919 align:start position:0%
headed uh there is an an opportunity
 
00:07:30.749 --> 00:07:30.759 align:start position:0%
here maybe to in to change and then
 
00:07:30.759 --> 00:07:31.869 align:start position:0%
here maybe to in to change and then
endorse

00:07:31.869 --> 00:07:31.879 align:start position:0%
endorse
 
00:07:35.909 --> 00:07:35.919 align:start position:0%
1385 and maybe reject 485
 
00:07:39.510 --> 00:07:39.520 align:start position:0%
as like the committee already passed
 
00:07:43.110 --> 00:07:43.120 align:start position:0%
1385 amended with 1098 we did that
 
00:07:44.790 --> 00:07:44.800 align:start position:0%
already so we're not going to amend it
 
00:07:46.749 --> 00:07:46.759 align:start position:0%
again we're not amending it so what
 
00:07:49.390 --> 00:07:49.400 align:start position:0%
we're doing is we're looking at 485 to
 
00:07:52.430 --> 00:07:52.440 align:start position:0%
either correct conflicts or just add
 
00:07:55.869 --> 00:07:55.879 align:start position:0%
something new or to even determine if we
 
00:07:59.149 --> 00:07:59.159 align:start position:0%
need 4 485 because it might be that at
 
00:08:02.029 --> 00:08:02.039 align:start position:0%
the end the day the corrections that we
 
00:08:04.790 --> 00:08:04.800 align:start position:0%
might to make to 485 are going to be
 
00:08:07.350 --> 00:08:07.360 align:start position:0%
such that all it's an improvement of
 
00:08:10.309 --> 00:08:10.319 align:start position:0%
1385 so so if we if if we were to
 
00:08:13.869 --> 00:08:13.879 align:start position:0%
endorse 485 yes would there have to be
 
00:08:15.950 --> 00:08:15.960 align:start position:0%
some Committee of conference to put the
 
00:08:18.589 --> 00:08:18.599 align:start position:0%
the two bills together to uh work out
 
00:08:20.830 --> 00:08:20.840 align:start position:0%
differences well if we were to change
 
00:08:25.230 --> 00:08:25.240 align:start position:0%
the 4 485 significantly enough we would
 
00:08:27.029 --> 00:08:27.039 align:start position:0%
ask the Senate to concur with our
 
00:08:29.909 --> 00:08:29.919 align:start position:0%
changes right we wouldn't have we
 
00:08:32.509 --> 00:08:32.519 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have to we could do that in a
 
00:08:34.310 --> 00:08:34.320 align:start position:0%
discussion with the Senate with the
 
00:08:36.070 --> 00:08:36.080 align:start position:0%
Senate Edna
 
00:08:40.389 --> 00:08:40.399 align:start position:0%
group thank you sure go ahead um Mr
 
00:08:44.389 --> 00:08:44.399 align:start position:0%
representative Brown so let's go down to
 
00:08:46.590 --> 00:08:46.600 align:start position:0%
where it says page three line 2 through
 
00:08:51.829 --> 00:08:51.839 align:start position:0%
five on HB 1385 so that is on 485 if you
 
00:08:56.750 --> 00:08:56.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:00.069 --> 00:09:00.079 align:start position:0%
11 where it says the executive un
 
00:09:01.630 --> 00:09:01.640 align:start position:0%
let me back up one more to where it says
 
00:09:05.509 --> 00:09:05.519 align:start position:0%
not addressed in 1385 so the on page two
 
00:09:07.949 --> 00:09:07.959 align:start position:0%
line 2 through
 
00:09:10.590 --> 00:09:10.600 align:start position:0%
7 the word
 
00:09:12.790 --> 00:09:12.800 align:start position:0%
commensurate appear I'm I'm making the
 
00:09:15.790 --> 00:09:15.800 align:start position:0%
note that the word commensurate appears
 
00:09:18.710 --> 00:09:18.720 align:start position:0%
in 1385 farther down and in here it does
 
00:09:21.110 --> 00:09:21.120 align:start position:0%
say the old language is substantially
 
00:09:22.829 --> 00:09:22.839 align:start position:0%
similar that I think we talked about it
 
00:09:25.750 --> 00:09:25.760 align:start position:0%
at nauseum this session whether we
 
00:09:29.110 --> 00:09:29.120 align:start position:0%
wanted that in there or not so I guess I
 
00:09:30.790 --> 00:09:30.800 align:start position:0%
would leave that to others
 
00:09:33.550 --> 00:09:33.560 align:start position:0%
to I'm just making the
 
00:09:33.560 --> 00:09:36.150 align:start position:0%
to I'm just making the
point

00:09:36.150 --> 00:09:36.160 align:start position:0%
point
 
00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:38.350 align:start position:0%
point
um

00:09:38.350 --> 00:09:38.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:09:40.550 --> 00:09:40.560 align:start position:0%
yeah representative Courtney do you have
 
00:09:44.430 --> 00:09:44.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:48.350 --> 00:09:48.360 align:start position:0%
that director Coury thank you so I think
 
00:09:50.870 --> 00:09:50.880 align:start position:0%
that the language in 1385 was distilled
 
00:09:52.870 --> 00:09:52.880 align:start position:0%
down to what we'd like it to be in terms
 
00:09:55.630 --> 00:09:55.640 align:start position:0%
of requiring the office to adopt rules
 
00:09:58.790 --> 00:09:58.800 align:start position:0%
to to determine what military training
 
00:10:03.590 --> 00:10:03.600 align:start position:0%
education experience is um acceptable to
 
00:10:05.829 --> 00:10:05.839 align:start position:0%
basically obtain a license I think that
 
00:10:09.430 --> 00:10:09.440 align:start position:0%
the distinction is that the language um
 
00:10:12.310 --> 00:10:12.320 align:start position:0%
in 485 includes that language that
 
00:10:15.470 --> 00:10:15.480 align:start position:0%
Senator Carson was interested in which
 
00:10:18.190 --> 00:10:18.200 align:start position:0%
includes digitally verifiable license
 
00:10:20.949 --> 00:10:20.959 align:start position:0%
and that's not included in
 
00:10:25.550 --> 00:10:25.560 align:start position:0%
1385 um but in terms of directing the
 
00:10:25.560 --> 00:10:26.910 align:start position:0%
1385 um but in terms of directing the
office

00:10:26.910 --> 00:10:26.920 align:start position:0%
office
 
00:10:30.790 --> 00:10:30.800 align:start position:0%
to uh adopt rules establishing you know
 
00:10:32.550 --> 00:10:32.560 align:start position:0%
the basis for obtaining a license I
 
00:10:35.590 --> 00:10:35.600 align:start position:0%
think the language in 1385 is is the
 
00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:37.069 align:start position:0%
think the language in 1385 is is the
preferable

00:10:37.069 --> 00:10:37.079 align:start position:0%
preferable
 
00:10:40.230 --> 00:10:40.240 align:start position:0%
language do you agree with that so so
 
00:10:42.750 --> 00:10:42.760 align:start position:0%
yeah my my two cents are the the benefit
 
00:10:45.269 --> 00:10:45.279 align:start position:0%
of 485 is it just adds the digitally
 
00:10:47.910 --> 00:10:47.920 align:start position:0%
verifiable license piece and the more
 
00:10:50.190 --> 00:10:50.200 align:start position:0%
the more exactly the same the language
 
00:10:52.470 --> 00:10:52.480 align:start position:0%
is the better because it just avoids
 
00:10:54.550 --> 00:10:54.560 align:start position:0%
Confusion And depending on which one of
 
00:10:57.069 --> 00:10:57.079 align:start position:0%
these gets signed Last by the governor
 
00:10:59.350 --> 00:10:59.360 align:start position:0%
that's what becomes the statute right so
 
00:11:00.949 --> 00:11:00.959 align:start position:0%
want them to be the same we want the
 
00:11:03.150 --> 00:11:03.160 align:start position:0%
language to be the same and at the end
 
00:11:05.790 --> 00:11:05.800 align:start position:0%
of the day it's just it's just happy to
 
00:11:08.790 --> 00:11:08.800 align:start position:0%
Glad in terms of commensurate versus you
 
00:11:11.389 --> 00:11:11.399 align:start position:0%
know substantially similar so they we
 
00:11:14.790 --> 00:11:14.800 align:start position:0%
should be looking to modify 485 so the
 
00:11:17.350 --> 00:11:17.360 align:start position:0%
language is exactly the same as it is in
 
00:11:20.870 --> 00:11:20.880 align:start position:0%
1385 as amended and that that's just it
 
00:11:22.629 --> 00:11:22.639 align:start position:0%
it makes sense and what we get out of
 
00:11:25.550 --> 00:11:25.560 align:start position:0%
485 rather than kill it is the is the
 
00:11:27.750 --> 00:11:27.760 align:start position:0%
digitally verifiable piece so that's an
 
00:11:29.550 --> 00:11:29.560 align:start position:0%
advantage and if that's what you want
 
00:11:32.150 --> 00:11:32.160 align:start position:0%
incent Bill 485 that's the part we can
 
00:11:35.269 --> 00:11:35.279 align:start position:0%
just make that
 
00:11:35.279 --> 00:11:37.470 align:start position:0%
just make that
a

00:11:37.470 --> 00:11:37.480 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:11:41.590 --> 00:11:41.600 align:start position:0%
uh an amendment to 1385 right because
 
00:11:44.030 --> 00:11:44.040 align:start position:0%
because if this if the governor signs
 
00:11:48.949 --> 00:11:48.959 align:start position:0%
1385 and then in 480 485 we we add the
 
00:11:51.710 --> 00:11:51.720 align:start position:0%
digital the the least the what I'm
 
00:11:53.470 --> 00:11:53.480 align:start position:0%
trying to say
 
00:11:57.030 --> 00:11:57.040 align:start position:0%
is um we should use the least number of
 
00:12:00.949 --> 00:12:00.959 align:start position:0%
words in 485 so we don't have conflict
 
00:12:04.389 --> 00:12:04.399 align:start position:0%
and we do what we wanted to do and at
 
00:12:05.750 --> 00:12:05.760 align:start position:0%
the end of the day representative I
 
00:12:07.550 --> 00:12:07.560 align:start position:0%
think that achieves the intent that the
 
00:12:10.069 --> 00:12:10.079 align:start position:0%
department would like to see okay so
 
00:12:11.670 --> 00:12:11.680 align:start position:0%
really with 485 what we're really
 
00:12:13.670 --> 00:12:13.680 align:start position:0%
looking for is the digitally verifiable
 
00:12:16.150 --> 00:12:16.160 align:start position:0%
license piece so what we're looking for
 
00:12:18.110 --> 00:12:18.120 align:start position:0%
is on
 
00:12:22.550 --> 00:12:22.560 align:start position:0%
page one of the bill from line
 
00:12:25.829 --> 00:12:25.839 align:start position:0%
26 right starting at 26 because that
 
00:12:28.509 --> 00:12:28.519 align:start position:0%
that's the section that has the digital
 
00:12:32.470 --> 00:12:32.480 align:start position:0%
licensing it's on page two line three to
 
00:12:34.310 --> 00:12:34.320 align:start position:0%
facilitate the license of a licensed
 
00:12:36.829 --> 00:12:36.839 align:start position:0%
digitally verifi license certificate I
 
00:12:38.030 --> 00:12:38.040 align:start position:0%
mean that's
 
00:12:40.990 --> 00:12:41.000 align:start position:0%
where that's what we want to do correct
 
00:12:46.069 --> 00:12:46.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:48.590 --> 00:12:48.600 align:start position:0%
ma'am Lindsay does what I said make
 
00:12:51.350 --> 00:12:51.360 align:start position:0%
sense I mean it yes it makes complete
 
00:12:53.550 --> 00:12:53.560 align:start position:0%
sense we've had issues with enrollment
 
00:12:55.629 --> 00:12:55.639 align:start position:0%
in the last couple of years uh when
 
00:12:58.629 --> 00:12:58.639 align:start position:0%
there are conflicts in the law um I
 
00:13:00.069 --> 00:13:00.079 align:start position:0%
think you could do it that way I think
 
00:13:01.550 --> 00:13:01.560 align:start position:0%
you could just essentially take what's
 
00:13:06.110 --> 00:13:06.120 align:start position:0%
in 1385 and put it in 485 the other
 
00:13:09.389 --> 00:13:09.399 align:start position:0%
thing you could do is just is just
 
00:13:12.069 --> 00:13:12.079 align:start position:0%
remove anything in 485 except the
 
00:13:14.150 --> 00:13:14.160 align:start position:0%
requirement that we adopt procedures to
 
00:13:16.189 --> 00:13:16.199 align:start position:0%
establish D digitally verifiable
 
00:13:18.110 --> 00:13:18.120 align:start position:0%
licenses you could do it that way as
 
00:13:20.910 --> 00:13:20.920 align:start position:0%
well and it would be a fairly small bill
 
00:13:23.629 --> 00:13:23.639 align:start position:0%
so my preference is to make things as
 
00:13:26.470 --> 00:13:26.480 align:start position:0%
small as possible because you never know
 
00:13:28.670 --> 00:13:28.680 align:start position:0%
how these things are going to you I
 
00:13:30.230 --> 00:13:30.240 align:start position:0%
don't want to get get tripped up later
 
00:13:31.949 --> 00:13:31.959 align:start position:0%
because of some Clause that we put in
 
00:13:33.269 --> 00:13:33.279 align:start position:0%
that we didn't know was going to be a
 
00:13:36.509 --> 00:13:36.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:39.350 --> 00:13:39.360 align:start position:0%
sense and I think that you know it it
 
00:13:41.310 --> 00:13:41.320 align:start position:0%
probably is worth our time to reach out
 
00:13:42.829 --> 00:13:42.839 align:start position:0%
to the prime sponsor in the Senate and
 
00:13:45.389 --> 00:13:45.399 align:start position:0%
say this is we've done this already in
 
00:13:47.509 --> 00:13:47.519 align:start position:0%
1385 and we're just gonna we're going to
 
00:13:49.750 --> 00:13:49.760 align:start position:0%
pair this down to avoid conflicts and my
 
00:13:51.310 --> 00:13:51.320 align:start position:0%
gut tells me that Senator Carson would
 
00:13:54.110 --> 00:13:54.120 align:start position:0%
be amable to that my gut tells me that
 
00:13:56.230 --> 00:13:56.240 align:start position:0%
yes and she I just met her in the uh on
 
00:13:57.870 --> 00:13:57.880 align:start position:0%
the way over here and she's going to
 
00:13:59.710 --> 00:13:59.720 align:start position:0%
spend a significant part of her morning
 
00:14:01.910 --> 00:14:01.920 align:start position:0%
here and that's something we can discuss
 
00:14:05.350 --> 00:14:05.360 align:start position:0%
with her so if everyone is
 
00:14:08.230 --> 00:14:08.240 align:start position:0%
agreeable that will be the discussion
 
00:14:11.509 --> 00:14:11.519 align:start position:0%
that I have with her yes
 
00:14:15.230 --> 00:14:15.240 align:start position:0%
yes um yeah and and just to underscore
 
00:14:17.150 --> 00:14:17.160 align:start position:0%
the importance of having that language
 
00:14:20.790 --> 00:14:20.800 align:start position:0%
in there for the portability of licenses
 
00:14:23.829 --> 00:14:23.839 align:start position:0%
for military spouses or Veterans as they
 
00:14:26.389 --> 00:14:26.399 align:start position:0%
move from one state to another that's
 
00:14:28.829 --> 00:14:28.839 align:start position:0%
absolutely essential um by it's not just
 
00:14:31.949 --> 00:14:31.959 align:start position:0%
a matter of having an online or digital
 
00:14:34.949 --> 00:14:34.959 align:start position:0%
application and processing uh system in
 
00:14:36.870 --> 00:14:36.880 align:start position:0%
place but it's also the ability for
 
00:14:39.150 --> 00:14:39.160 align:start position:0%
spouses take those licenses which are
 
00:14:41.990 --> 00:14:42.000 align:start position:0%
verified digitally with them into new
 
00:14:43.870 --> 00:14:43.880 align:start position:0%
places when they permanently change
 
00:14:46.310 --> 00:14:46.320 align:start position:0%
station for example and facilitate their
 
00:14:48.189 --> 00:14:48.199 align:start position:0%
ability to be recognized more quickly
 
00:14:53.670 --> 00:14:53.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:56.550 --> 00:14:56.560 align:start position:0%
well yes um representative Brown thank
 
00:15:00.350 --> 00:15:00.360 align:start position:0%
you so on page two of 485 y so that
 
00:15:02.269 --> 00:15:02.279 align:start position:0%
starting on line two that entire
 
00:15:04.710 --> 00:15:04.720 align:start position:0%
paragraph that says the procedure shall
 
00:15:07.509 --> 00:15:07.519 align:start position:0%
that entire paragraph is added and it
 
00:15:08.870 --> 00:15:08.880 align:start position:0%
looks like it only has to do with
 
00:15:14.230 --> 00:15:14.240 align:start position:0%
digitally verifiable licensing so uh uh
 
00:15:16.110 --> 00:15:16.120 align:start position:0%
General Perry and director Courtney are
 
00:15:18.389 --> 00:15:18.399 align:start position:0%
you okay with that entire paragraph
 
00:15:21.110 --> 00:15:21.120 align:start position:0%
because that's not in 1385 that whole
 
00:15:23.430 --> 00:15:23.440 align:start position:0%
paragraph is starting with the procedur
 
00:15:25.389 --> 00:15:25.399 align:start position:0%
shall include
 
00:15:28.509 --> 00:15:28.519 align:start position:0%
okay actually down to line seven sorry
 
00:15:28.519 --> 00:15:33.629 align:start position:0%
okay actually down to line seven sorry
MH

00:15:33.629 --> 00:15:33.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:34.990 --> 00:15:35.000 align:start position:0%
I I think I'm comfortable with that
 
00:15:36.430 --> 00:15:36.440 align:start position:0%
language I will
 
00:15:39.350 --> 00:15:39.360 align:start position:0%
say we currently have the
 
00:15:42.629 --> 00:15:42.639 align:start position:0%
language in our statute that requires us
 
00:15:45.389 --> 00:15:45.399 align:start position:0%
to facilitate the issuance of a license
 
00:15:48.949 --> 00:15:48.959 align:start position:0%
and no one really knows what that means
 
00:15:51.350 --> 00:15:51.360 align:start position:0%
in terms of implementing so if there is
 
00:15:55.749 --> 00:15:55.759 align:start position:0%
an opportunity I think to to clarify
 
00:15:59.389 --> 00:15:59.399 align:start position:0%
exactly what what what that means to
 
00:16:01.150 --> 00:16:01.160 align:start position:0%
facilitate a license I think the
 
00:16:05.150 --> 00:16:05.160 align:start position:0%
language the procedure shall include um
 
00:16:07.949 --> 00:16:07.959 align:start position:0%
it works for us but I think it has
 
00:16:10.550 --> 00:16:10.560 align:start position:0%
created confusion when we've implemented
 
00:16:14.710 --> 00:16:14.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:17.470 --> 00:16:17.480 align:start position:0%
past it's fine with me if it's fine with
 
00:16:17.480 --> 00:16:18.629 align:start position:0%
past it's fine with me if it's fine with
everybody

00:16:18.629 --> 00:16:18.639 align:start position:0%
everybody
 
00:16:20.949 --> 00:16:20.959 align:start position:0%
else I'm good with it as long as it's
 
00:16:22.990 --> 00:16:23.000 align:start position:0%
consistent you know the substantially
 
00:16:24.990 --> 00:16:25.000 align:start position:0%
similar language is consistent across
 
00:16:27.350 --> 00:16:27.360 align:start position:0%
all of the statutes right so and I and I
 
00:16:28.949 --> 00:16:28.959 align:start position:0%
I get confused you know where we use
 
00:16:30.470 --> 00:16:30.480 align:start position:0%
commerate where we use substantially
 
00:16:32.389 --> 00:16:32.399 align:start position:0%
similar and I know that was a you know
 
00:16:35.230 --> 00:16:35.240 align:start position:0%
that was a a pretty uh substantial
 
00:16:38.189 --> 00:16:38.199 align:start position:0%
debate earlier uh but so as long as it's
 
00:16:40.430 --> 00:16:40.440 align:start position:0%
the same and we don't have this other
 
00:16:42.189 --> 00:16:42.199 align:start position:0%
you know we don't we don't create some
 
00:16:44.870 --> 00:16:44.880 align:start position:0%
other sense of Confusion by like just
 
00:16:49.110 --> 00:16:49.120 align:start position:0%
non non exactly the same
 
00:16:51.790 --> 00:16:51.800 align:start position:0%
language so would it make sense to
 
00:16:53.430 --> 00:16:53.440 align:start position:0%
change those two words to commensurate
 
00:16:56.189 --> 00:16:56.199 align:start position:0%
as we've put that in 1385
 
00:16:58.230 --> 00:16:58.240 align:start position:0%
already I think it should be consistent
 
00:16:59.550 --> 00:16:59.560 align:start position:0%
with 138
 
00:17:02.350 --> 00:17:02.360 align:start position:0%
5 say say again sorry I think it should
 
00:17:04.110 --> 00:17:04.120 align:start position:0%
be consistent with
 
00:17:06.710 --> 00:17:06.720 align:start position:0%
1385 so that's on line five we would
 
00:17:09.270 --> 00:17:09.280 align:start position:0%
remove suly similar and put
 
00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:14.029 align:start position:0%
remove suly similar and put
commensurate

00:17:14.029 --> 00:17:14.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:19.429 --> 00:17:19.439 align:start position:0%
right starting with line two at the end
 
00:17:22.669 --> 00:17:22.679 align:start position:0%
yes right and then I have a comment on
 
00:17:25.669 --> 00:17:25.679 align:start position:0%
uh section three the same page line 16
 
00:17:29.510 --> 00:17:29.520 align:start position:0%
and 17 procedure for issuing digitally
 
00:17:32.950 --> 00:17:32.960 align:start position:0%
verify licenses do we is that
 
00:17:37.870 --> 00:17:37.880 align:start position:0%
in is that is Clause 38 I'm sorry three
 
00:17:43.430 --> 00:17:43.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:46.870 --> 00:17:46.880 align:start position:0%
the okay so we should probably put
 
00:17:49.669 --> 00:17:49.679 align:start position:0%
everything from the procedure down to
 
00:17:57.830 --> 00:17:57.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:01.669 --> 00:18:01.679 align:start position:0%
that I'm just I'm just verifying here
 
00:18:04.190 --> 00:18:04.200 align:start position:0%
yeah that and I think that gets at
 
00:18:06.270 --> 00:18:06.280 align:start position:0%
Lindsay's comment about how do we do
 
00:18:08.310 --> 00:18:08.320 align:start position:0%
this and this says do it by rules right
 
00:18:10.510 --> 00:18:10.520 align:start position:0%
I mean essentially that's what that
 
00:18:12.990 --> 00:18:13.000 align:start position:0%
said yes so I think you could just add a
 
00:18:15.270 --> 00:18:15.280 align:start position:0%
requirement that we adopt
 
00:18:15.280 --> 00:18:16.909 align:start position:0%
requirement that we adopt
procedures

00:18:16.909 --> 00:18:16.919 align:start position:0%
procedures
 
00:18:19.029 --> 00:18:19.039 align:start position:0%
um you know essentially copy the
 
00:18:21.870 --> 00:18:21.880 align:start position:0%
language that's in 485 right now and
 
00:18:26.230 --> 00:18:26.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:28.390 --> 00:18:28.400 align:start position:0%
obligation so yeah there there's some
 
00:18:31.830 --> 00:18:31.840 align:start position:0%
slight differences so on 485 on on page
 
00:18:34.430 --> 00:18:34.440 align:start position:0%
three on line 10 MH it says what
 
00:18:36.470 --> 00:18:36.480 align:start position:0%
constitutes military education training
 
00:18:39.070 --> 00:18:39.080 align:start position:0%
or service acceptable blah blah blah but
 
00:18:42.549 --> 00:18:42.559 align:start position:0%
in what we approved in 1385 it
 
00:18:45.070 --> 00:18:45.080 align:start position:0%
says for what constitutes commenor
 
00:18:46.950 --> 00:18:46.960 align:start position:0%
military education training or service
 
00:18:50.710 --> 00:18:50.720 align:start position:0%
so it and then it does refer to 337 g7i
 
00:18:53.549 --> 00:18:53.559 align:start position:0%
which is one which is what one of the
 
00:18:55.149 --> 00:18:55.159 align:start position:0%
main things we wanted to make sure we
 
00:18:58.070 --> 00:18:58.080 align:start position:0%
didn't miss so that language is a little
 
00:18:58.080 --> 00:18:59.590 align:start position:0%
didn't miss so that language is a little
different

00:18:59.590 --> 00:18:59.600 align:start position:0%
different
 
00:18:59.600 --> 00:19:02.549 align:start position:0%
different
uh

00:19:02.549 --> 00:19:02.559 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:19:07.350 --> 00:19:07.360 align:start position:0%
uh BC and D on 485 aren't in
 
00:19:13.270 --> 00:19:13.280 align:start position:0%
our uh Amendment 1385 Amendment yeah I I
 
00:19:15.430 --> 00:19:15.440 align:start position:0%
don't I I don't know if that those are
 
00:19:17.350 --> 00:19:17.360 align:start position:0%
needed or not director if that's
 
00:19:20.029 --> 00:19:20.039 align:start position:0%
something you have elsewhere or if
 
00:19:23.750 --> 00:19:23.760 align:start position:0%
I so that would be lines 12 uh 12
 
00:19:27.710 --> 00:19:27.720 align:start position:0%
through 17 on 485 page
 
00:19:27.720 --> 00:19:30.110 align:start position:0%
through 17 on 485 page
two

00:19:30.110 --> 00:19:30.120 align:start position:0%
two
 
00:19:31.990 --> 00:19:32.000 align:start position:0%
so I think arguably we already have rle
 
00:19:33.990 --> 00:19:34.000 align:start position:0%
making Authority for
 
00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:36.870 align:start position:0%
making Authority for
b

00:19:36.870 --> 00:19:36.880 align:start position:0%
b
 
00:19:39.630 --> 00:19:39.640 align:start position:0%
c we probably already have it for D our
 
00:19:41.669 --> 00:19:41.679 align:start position:0%
Ru making Authority is pretty broad with
 
00:19:43.070 --> 00:19:43.080 align:start position:0%
respect to
 
00:19:45.070 --> 00:19:45.080 align:start position:0%
procedures I think if it were me and I
 
00:19:46.830 --> 00:19:46.840 align:start position:0%
were just going
 
00:19:51.789 --> 00:19:51.799 align:start position:0%
to do this what what I would do is I
 
00:19:54.149 --> 00:19:54.159 align:start position:0%
would obviously
 
00:19:58.350 --> 00:19:58.360 align:start position:0%
1385 is moving forward I would do a
 
00:20:01.350 --> 00:20:01.360 align:start position:0%
repeat in replace um or an amendment to
 
00:20:03.990 --> 00:20:04.000 align:start position:0%
replace the entirety of 485 and
 
00:20:06.149 --> 00:20:06.159 align:start position:0%
basically just establish another
 
00:20:07.909 --> 00:20:07.919 align:start position:0%
provision under
 
00:20:10.590 --> 00:20:10.600 align:start position:0%
31016 setting forth exactly what a
 
00:20:13.549 --> 00:20:13.559 align:start position:0%
digitally verifiable license is a
 
00:20:16.830 --> 00:20:16.840 align:start position:0%
requirement that the office uh make
 
00:20:19.190 --> 00:20:19.200 align:start position:0%
available uh or use digitally verifiable
 
00:20:21.270 --> 00:20:21.280 align:start position:0%
licenses at least for military service
 
00:20:23.630 --> 00:20:23.640 align:start position:0%
members and then give the office roeming
 
00:20:24.870 --> 00:20:24.880 align:start position:0%
Authority and I think that would
 
00:20:27.470 --> 00:20:27.480 align:start position:0%
accomplish uh Senator Carson's intent
 
00:20:30.350 --> 00:20:30.360 align:start position:0%
assuming she's she would be agreeable to
 
00:20:31.830 --> 00:20:31.840 align:start position:0%
moving in that direction I think that
 
00:20:34.950 --> 00:20:34.960 align:start position:0%
would be the cleanest route as opposed
 
00:20:37.470 --> 00:20:37.480 align:start position:0%
to trying to crossw walk this and make
 
00:20:44.710 --> 00:20:44.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:47.230 --> 00:20:47.240 align:start position:0%
conflicts so saying that do you want to
 
00:20:50.950 --> 00:20:50.960 align:start position:0%
help us write the amend the the re the
 
00:20:53.870 --> 00:20:53.880 align:start position:0%
amended version of 485 I I can certainly
 
00:20:55.830 --> 00:20:55.840 align:start position:0%
do that
 
00:20:58.750 --> 00:20:58.760 align:start position:0%
um and I know and I'm and I'm happy to
 
00:21:00.590 --> 00:21:00.600 align:start position:0%
talk to Senator Carson too about that to
 
00:21:01.990 --> 00:21:02.000 align:start position:0%
make sure she would be comfortable with
 
00:21:04.669 --> 00:21:04.679 align:start position:0%
that approach right so in summary what
 
00:21:07.310 --> 00:21:07.320 align:start position:0%
we're saying is we're going to
 
00:21:11.070 --> 00:21:11.080 align:start position:0%
add on page two from line two to line
 
00:21:12.669 --> 00:21:12.679 align:start position:0%
seven that
 
00:21:16.549 --> 00:21:16.559 align:start position:0%
paragraph and then we're going
 
00:21:20.390 --> 00:21:20.400 align:start position:0%
to give the oplc
 
00:21:23.590 --> 00:21:23.600 align:start position:0%
office Clarity on the procedure for
 
00:21:26.070 --> 00:21:26.080 align:start position:0%
issuing digitally verified licenses is
 
00:21:27.510 --> 00:21:27.520 align:start position:0%
that what we're
 
00:21:27.520 --> 00:21:29.110 align:start position:0%
that what we're
saying

00:21:29.110 --> 00:21:29.120 align:start position:0%
saying
 
00:21:30.430 --> 00:21:30.440 align:start position:0%
yes and I would just make sure we have R
 
00:21:33.470 --> 00:21:33.480 align:start position:0%
making authority to flesh that
 
00:21:33.480 --> 00:21:36.909 align:start position:0%
making authority to flesh that
out

00:21:36.909 --> 00:21:36.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:40.710 --> 00:21:40.720 align:start position:0%
okay and then there's one more piece yep
 
00:21:42.430 --> 00:21:42.440 align:start position:0%
so on the second page I what I handed
 
00:21:46.789 --> 00:21:46.799 align:start position:0%
you if if you recall um when when this
 
00:21:49.669 --> 00:21:49.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:52.070 --> 00:21:52.080 align:start position:0%
committee the history of this is that
 
00:21:56.029 --> 00:21:56.039 align:start position:0%
332 G7 requires all boards to create a
 
00:21:57.590 --> 00:21:57.600 align:start position:0%
crosswalk and a matrix and they haven't
 
00:22:01.029 --> 00:22:01.039 align:start position:0%
done it so uh director Courtney said
 
00:22:02.510 --> 00:22:02.520 align:start position:0%
that oplc would pick up that
 
00:22:04.070 --> 00:22:04.080 align:start position:0%
responsibility and guaranteed rules
 
00:22:06.230 --> 00:22:06.240 align:start position:0%
would be done within whatever frame we
 
00:22:09.070 --> 00:22:09.080 align:start position:0%
put in under the boards that were for
 
00:22:10.789 --> 00:22:10.799 align:start position:0%
the boards that are under oplc which
 
00:22:15.230 --> 00:22:15.240 align:start position:0%
leaves a few boards outside of that we
 
00:22:17.029 --> 00:22:17.039 align:start position:0%
didn't put that amendment in 1385
 
00:22:19.110 --> 00:22:19.120 align:start position:0%
because it was too late we didn't change
 
00:22:21.990 --> 00:22:22.000 align:start position:0%
that so the second page that I handed
 
00:22:25.789 --> 00:22:25.799 align:start position:0%
you is what we had agreed on I think
 
00:22:29.190 --> 00:22:29.200 align:start position:0%
between uh General Perry and director C
 
00:22:32.669 --> 00:22:32.679 align:start position:0%
Courtney um about an amendment to cover
 
00:22:34.710 --> 00:22:34.720 align:start position:0%
the boards that are not under oplc so
 
00:22:36.630 --> 00:22:36.640 align:start position:0%
this would be an
 
00:22:40.669 --> 00:22:40.679 align:start position:0%
addition to 485 then so you're talking
 
00:22:42.350 --> 00:22:42.360 align:start position:0%
about Clause
 
00:22:46.230 --> 00:22:46.240 align:start position:0%
four yes uh if it ends up being four at
 
00:22:49.630 --> 00:22:49.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:53.230 --> 00:22:53.240 align:start position:0%
yes right I remember that
 
00:22:55.310 --> 00:22:55.320 align:start position:0%
conversation does anybody have any
 
00:22:59.350 --> 00:22:59.360 align:start position:0%
comments on that no okay and I and I
 
00:23:02.710 --> 00:23:02.720 align:start position:0%
don't think director there's no no
 
00:23:05.269 --> 00:23:05.279 align:start position:0%
reason that some of those lines are bold
 
00:23:09.950 --> 00:23:09.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:12.510 --> 00:23:12.520 align:start position:0%
error all right so does anybody else
 
00:23:15.430 --> 00:23:15.440 align:start position:0%
have any comments because if not I think
 
00:23:16.390 --> 00:23:16.400 align:start position:0%
we've done
 
00:23:18.870 --> 00:23:18.880 align:start position:0%
our work for the
 
00:23:21.549 --> 00:23:21.559 align:start position:0%
subcommittee yes so there was some
 
00:23:23.190 --> 00:23:23.200 align:start position:0%
concern in the committee about whether a
 
00:23:26.350 --> 00:23:26.360 align:start position:0%
digitally verifiable licensing piece was
 
00:23:28.149 --> 00:23:28.159 align:start position:0%
necessary and I think the senator wants
 
00:23:28.159 --> 00:23:29.070 align:start position:0%
necessary and I think the senator wants
that

00:23:29.070 --> 00:23:29.080 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:23:30.870 --> 00:23:30.880 align:start position:0%
is someone here that can explain exactly
 
00:23:31.789 --> 00:23:31.799 align:start position:0%
what that
 
00:23:34.990 --> 00:23:35.000 align:start position:0%
is because the director had said we have
 
00:23:38.549 --> 00:23:38.559 align:start position:0%
some capability already or or is it not
 
00:23:40.149 --> 00:23:40.159 align:start position:0%
a thing I need to worry
 
00:23:42.870 --> 00:23:42.880 align:start position:0%
about so I do think that representative
 
00:23:44.870 --> 00:23:44.880 align:start position:0%
McGuire made a few comments and there's
 
00:23:48.269 --> 00:23:48.279 align:start position:0%
a desire to have that better fleshed out
 
00:23:51.950 --> 00:23:51.960 align:start position:0%
um as to what exactly that
 
00:23:54.590 --> 00:23:54.600 align:start position:0%
entails I'm not the person to be able to
 
00:23:57.430 --> 00:23:57.440 align:start position:0%
do that so
 
00:24:01.510 --> 00:24:01.520 align:start position:0%
if I mean mer Meritt is very happy to
 
00:24:03.750 --> 00:24:03.760 align:start position:0%
present uh what this looks like uh we've
 
00:24:05.310 --> 00:24:05.320 align:start position:0%
been working very closely with a number
 
00:24:07.070 --> 00:24:07.080 align:start position:0%
of other states to include Kansas Rhode
 
00:24:09.230 --> 00:24:09.240 align:start position:0%
Island Illinois on on what this looks
 
00:24:11.269 --> 00:24:11.279 align:start position:0%
like and and what shape that could take
 
00:24:12.909 --> 00:24:12.919 align:start position:0%
so we could definitely organize
 
00:24:14.590 --> 00:24:14.600 align:start position:0%
something for either the subcommittee or
 
00:24:17.310 --> 00:24:17.320 align:start position:0%
for yourself or both uh in in in terms
 
00:24:19.269 --> 00:24:19.279 align:start position:0%
of what that could potentially look like
 
00:24:20.830 --> 00:24:20.840 align:start position:0%
for you so we're we're more than happy
 
00:24:22.909 --> 00:24:22.919 align:start position:0%
to to do
 
00:24:26.149 --> 00:24:26.159 align:start position:0%
that okay great I think it would be
 
00:24:28.510 --> 00:24:28.520 align:start position:0%
helpful to have some language as
 
00:24:30.710 --> 00:24:30.720 align:start position:0%
essentially you know if if the office is
 
00:24:32.269 --> 00:24:32.279 align:start position:0%
going to have an
 
00:24:34.750 --> 00:24:34.760 align:start position:0%
obligation to have a system or software
 
00:24:36.430 --> 00:24:36.440 align:start position:0%
or whatever that may be I think we need
 
00:24:39.669 --> 00:24:39.679 align:start position:0%
to have that better defined in statute
 
00:24:41.630 --> 00:24:41.640 align:start position:0%
and so is there some language that you
 
00:24:44.070 --> 00:24:44.080 align:start position:0%
could send me that I can include in the
 
00:24:46.750 --> 00:24:46.760 align:start position:0%
in the draft proposed amendment that
 
00:24:49.269 --> 00:24:49.279 align:start position:0%
would better better
 
00:24:51.710 --> 00:24:51.720 align:start position:0%
Define what is meant by a digitally
 
00:24:51.720 --> 00:24:53.750 align:start position:0%
Define what is meant by a digitally
verifiable

00:24:53.750 --> 00:24:53.760 align:start position:0%
verifiable
 
00:24:56.630 --> 00:24:56.640 align:start position:0%
license I I actually already made a note
 
00:24:59.510 --> 00:24:59.520 align:start position:0%
uh to to to to get you some uh to take a
 
00:25:01.590 --> 00:25:01.600 align:start position:0%
look at so uh as soon as we're finished
 
00:25:04.029 --> 00:25:04.039 align:start position:0%
here I'll be in touch with uh with with
 
00:25:06.149 --> 00:25:06.159 align:start position:0%
my people and then uh I'll pass it along
 
00:25:10.110 --> 00:25:10.120 align:start position:0%
to Eric to to to provide to you perfect
 
00:25:13.029 --> 00:25:13.039 align:start position:0%
yes just and I think what just go back
 
00:25:16.389 --> 00:25:16.399 align:start position:0%
to lay people right not not experts in
 
00:25:20.029 --> 00:25:20.039 align:start position:0%
licensing but just a definition right
 
00:25:21.029 --> 00:25:21.039 align:start position:0%
that's I think that's what we're looking
 
00:25:23.350 --> 00:25:23.360 align:start position:0%
for a definition of digitally verifiable
 
00:25:24.549 --> 00:25:24.559 align:start position:0%
license that's really what we're looking
 
00:25:26.029 --> 00:25:26.039 align:start position:0%
for right that's I think that's the
 
00:25:28.909 --> 00:25:28.919 align:start position:0%
question you asked okay yeah thank you
 
00:25:30.830 --> 00:25:30.840 align:start position:0%
sorry that's
 
00:25:36.669 --> 00:25:36.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:40.950 --> 00:25:40.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:43.750 --> 00:25:43.760 align:start position:0%
question so I just want to confirm then
 
00:25:45.510 --> 00:25:45.520 align:start position:0%
what we'll do is um we'll have an
 
00:25:48.990 --> 00:25:49.000 align:start position:0%
amendment for next Wednesday on the 17th
 
00:25:50.630 --> 00:25:50.640 align:start position:0%
we'll have a very short subcommittee
 
00:25:53.110 --> 00:25:53.120 align:start position:0%
meeting where we can agree on the
 
00:25:55.789 --> 00:25:55.799 align:start position:0%
amendment and thanks everybody for your
 
00:25:57.990 --> 00:25:58.000 align:start position:0%

Bron uh chair Maguire is in Senate Edna
 
01:00:08.710 --> 01:00:08.720 align:start position:0%
at the moment so um she asked me to get
 
01:00:10.549 --> 01:00:10.559 align:start position:0%
the public hearings going so it being 10
 
01:00:11.750 --> 01:00:11.760 align:start position:0%
o'clock I'm going to open the public
 
01:00:14.470 --> 01:00:14.480 align:start position:0%
hearing on SB 599 and welcome
 
01:00:16.029 --> 01:00:16.039 align:start position:0%
representative Greta to introduce the
 
01:00:18.789 --> 01:00:18.799 align:start position:0%
Bill thank thank you Mr chair um so
 
01:00:21.349 --> 01:00:21.359 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 599 is relative to the state
 
01:00:24.150 --> 01:00:24.160 align:start position:0%
fire code you might know that the um
 
01:00:26.069 --> 01:00:26.079 align:start position:0%
building code is one is a bill that we
 
01:00:30.309 --> 01:00:30.319 align:start position:0%
passed in the house in our in our um
 
01:00:33.630 --> 01:00:33.640 align:start position:0%
committee recently and the state codes
 
01:00:36.750 --> 01:00:36.760 align:start position:0%
are independent of the building codes
 
01:00:38.390 --> 01:00:38.400 align:start position:0%
and that's why they require a separate
 
01:00:40.270 --> 01:00:40.280 align:start position:0%
bill and I'm here just to introduce the
 
01:00:42.029 --> 01:00:42.039 align:start position:0%
bill and I'm sure there are other people
 
01:00:45.349 --> 01:00:45.359 align:start position:0%
here who could speak about it more apply
 
01:00:46.950 --> 01:00:46.960 align:start position:0%
thank you very
 
01:00:54.910 --> 01:00:54.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:54.920 --> 01:00:59.750 align:start position:0%
 
Tumi

01:00:59.750 --> 01:00:59.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:01.549 --> 01:01:01.559 align:start position:0%
good morning Sean Tumi the State Fire
 
01:01:03.029 --> 01:01:03.039 align:start position:0%
Marshall for the record thank you for
 
01:01:06.029 --> 01:01:06.039 align:start position:0%
allowing me to speak this morning um so
 
01:01:08.029 --> 01:01:08.039 align:start position:0%
as representative mentioned the state
 
01:01:09.670 --> 01:01:09.680 align:start position:0%
fire code is is separate from the
 
01:01:12.390 --> 01:01:12.400 align:start position:0%
building code uh we are currently in the
 
01:01:15.430 --> 01:01:15.440 align:start position:0%
2018 edition of the uh State Fire code
 
01:01:17.510 --> 01:01:17.520 align:start position:0%
our goal is in the codes as we've heard
 
01:01:20.510 --> 01:01:20.520 align:start position:0%
is to stay one code cycle behind we are
 
01:01:23.230 --> 01:01:23.240 align:start position:0%
uh looking to move forward with the 2021
 
01:01:25.549 --> 01:01:25.559 align:start position:0%
codes which would be NFPA 1 and 101 at
 
01:01:30.510 --> 01:01:30.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:32.750 --> 01:01:32.760 align:start position:0%
pause yeah I knew you were busy so
 
01:01:34.750 --> 01:01:34.760 align:start position:0%
Jackie just introduced it so good I'll
 
01:01:38.309 --> 01:01:38.319 align:start position:0%
finish it for you sorry Mr Jimmy no no
 
01:01:41.549 --> 01:01:41.559 align:start position:0%
problem um so we're as I said going to
 
01:01:43.750 --> 01:01:43.760 align:start position:0%
the 20121 addition of the codes the uh
 
01:01:46.069 --> 01:01:46.079 align:start position:0%
Board of Fire Control and my office have
 
01:01:48.549 --> 01:01:48.559 align:start position:0%
uh worked together with stakeholders to
 
01:01:50.829 --> 01:01:50.839 align:start position:0%
look at necessary amendments there was
 
01:01:52.230 --> 01:01:52.240 align:start position:0%
public hearings with the board of Fire
 
01:01:55.430 --> 01:01:55.440 align:start position:0%
Control uh and we uh had uh several
 
01:01:57.750 --> 01:01:57.760 align:start position:0%
carry amendments and then I'll go over a
 
01:01:59.789 --> 01:01:59.799 align:start position:0%
couple other amendments that we're doing
 
01:02:01.109 --> 01:02:01.119 align:start position:0%
uh they were heard in public hearing
 
01:02:03.990 --> 01:02:04.000 align:start position:0%
passed uh we moved it to the advisory
 
01:02:06.029 --> 01:02:06.039 align:start position:0%
the legislative advisory on building
 
01:02:08.029 --> 01:02:08.039 align:start position:0%
fire codes and received support from
 
01:02:09.710 --> 01:02:09.720 align:start position:0%
that committee and then moved to a bill
 
01:02:11.870 --> 01:02:11.880 align:start position:0%
so a couple of the highlights for the
 
01:02:16.069 --> 01:02:16.079 align:start position:0%
moving from the 2018 to 21 in the uh
 
01:02:18.349 --> 01:02:18.359 align:start position:0%
requirements for restaurants and bars
 
01:02:20.269 --> 01:02:20.279 align:start position:0%
the in the assembly aumy so anything
 
01:02:22.829 --> 01:02:22.839 align:start position:0%
over 50 people the 21 codes were going
 
01:02:23.990 --> 01:02:24.000 align:start position:0%
to get much more aggressive on the
 
01:02:26.510 --> 01:02:26.520 align:start position:0%
requirements for sprinklers so uh
 
01:02:29.109 --> 01:02:29.119 align:start position:0%
anything over 50 would require uh
 
01:02:31.069 --> 01:02:31.079 align:start position:0%
sprinkler system for even a small
 
01:02:33.670 --> 01:02:33.680 align:start position:0%
restaurant and uh so what we did was we
 
01:02:35.710 --> 01:02:35.720 align:start position:0%
chose to keep it the same as what we are
 
01:02:39.829 --> 01:02:39.839 align:start position:0%
today um and no change from the 2018s we
 
01:02:42.109 --> 01:02:42.119 align:start position:0%
we thought that that would be uncessary
 
01:02:45.390 --> 01:02:45.400 align:start position:0%
B burden on uh folks in New Hampshire to
 
01:02:47.230 --> 01:02:47.240 align:start position:0%
try to have to sprinkle like a small
 
01:02:49.430 --> 01:02:49.440 align:start position:0%
Diner or something like that uh
 
01:02:52.230 --> 01:02:52.240 align:start position:0%
similarly on daycares uh all new
 
01:02:54.710 --> 01:02:54.720 align:start position:0%
daycares were going to be required to be
 
01:02:58.750 --> 01:02:58.760 align:start position:0%
sprinkled uh and instead of uh
 
01:03:00.549 --> 01:03:00.559 align:start position:0%
regardless of size and things like that
 
01:03:02.510 --> 01:03:02.520 align:start position:0%
so we kept it to maintain the same
 
01:03:06.190 --> 01:03:06.200 align:start position:0%
requirements under the 2018 chapter um
 
01:03:07.910 --> 01:03:07.920 align:start position:0%
there were some requirements that came
 
01:03:10.109 --> 01:03:10.119 align:start position:0%
into play and there's a fight about um
 
01:03:12.470 --> 01:03:12.480 align:start position:0%
portable generator spacing and then you
 
01:03:15.670 --> 01:03:15.680 align:start position:0%
can read um anywhere from 5T up to 20 ft
 
01:03:17.910 --> 01:03:17.920 align:start position:0%
of the distance between a port for a
 
01:03:20.029 --> 01:03:20.039 align:start position:0%
portable generator away from a house we
 
01:03:21.589 --> 01:03:21.599 align:start position:0%
know we want people not to run their
 
01:03:23.390 --> 01:03:23.400 align:start position:0%
generators in their homes in their
 
01:03:24.950 --> 01:03:24.960 align:start position:0%
garages because of their fear of carbon
 
01:03:26.870 --> 01:03:26.880 align:start position:0%
monoxide poison
 
01:03:30.230 --> 01:03:30.240 align:start position:0%
um so you can run a stationary generator
 
01:03:32.789 --> 01:03:32.799 align:start position:0%
about 5 ft from your house um but we so
 
01:03:33.990 --> 01:03:34.000 align:start position:0%
we thought it was a little bit
 
01:03:36.230 --> 01:03:36.240 align:start position:0%
unnecessary to say that to force someone
 
01:03:38.549 --> 01:03:38.559 align:start position:0%
to go to 20 ft um most of the people
 
01:03:40.710 --> 01:03:40.720 align:start position:0%
that have the cord sets preset cord sets
 
01:03:42.630 --> 01:03:42.640 align:start position:0%
are not set up to go that distance so
 
01:03:44.269 --> 01:03:44.279 align:start position:0%
then people would be doing some funny
 
01:03:45.549 --> 01:03:45.559 align:start position:0%
stuff electrically which we thought
 
01:03:48.390 --> 01:03:48.400 align:start position:0%
would be add risk so uh we're going to
 
01:03:51.150 --> 01:03:51.160 align:start position:0%
keep the distance um as it is in the
 
01:03:53.150 --> 01:03:53.160 align:start position:0%
2018 codes and just encourage people to
 
01:03:54.829 --> 01:03:54.839 align:start position:0%
get them as far away from their homes
 
01:03:56.470 --> 01:03:56.480 align:start position:0%
and open window openings and door
 
01:03:58.390 --> 01:03:58.400 align:start position:0%
openings as we can to minimize any
 
01:03:59.789 --> 01:03:59.799 align:start position:0%
dangers around carbon monoxide
 
01:04:01.910 --> 01:04:01.920 align:start position:0%
protection so maintaining what we have
 
01:04:04.349 --> 01:04:04.359 align:start position:0%
is is the kind of the trend I would tell
 
01:04:07.269 --> 01:04:07.279 align:start position:0%
you that the biggest uh amendment that
 
01:04:09.470 --> 01:04:09.480 align:start position:0%
we dealt with is the the issue about res
 
01:04:11.470 --> 01:04:11.480 align:start position:0%
residential sprinkle protection for
 
01:04:14.109 --> 01:04:14.119 align:start position:0%
existing uh dwelling units up to four
 
01:04:18.109 --> 01:04:18.119 align:start position:0%
four so we've had the uh exemption for
 
01:04:19.670 --> 01:04:19.680 align:start position:0%
sprinklers for one and two family homes
 
01:04:22.470 --> 01:04:22.480 align:start position:0%
on the books for quite some time uh we
 
01:04:25.829 --> 01:04:25.839 align:start position:0%
are seeing a lot of inquiries lately um
 
01:04:27.990 --> 01:04:28.000 align:start position:0%
you know think the old Main Street um
 
01:04:31.150 --> 01:04:31.160 align:start position:0%
buildings that were once all residential
 
01:04:32.910 --> 01:04:32.920 align:start position:0%
somewhere along the line they went to a
 
01:04:34.470 --> 01:04:34.480 align:start position:0%
commercial like a business use on the
 
01:04:36.190 --> 01:04:36.200 align:start position:0%
first floor and now they're looking to
 
01:04:39.190 --> 01:04:39.200 align:start position:0%
go back to residential and uh maybe
 
01:04:40.789 --> 01:04:40.799 align:start position:0%
adding one or two units on that first
 
01:04:43.029 --> 01:04:43.039 align:start position:0%
floor where there's two above say that
 
01:04:44.470 --> 01:04:44.480 align:start position:0%
would require the whole building to be
 
01:04:48.990 --> 01:04:49.000 align:start position:0%
sprinkled um which was pretty uh uh
 
01:04:50.990 --> 01:04:51.000 align:start position:0%
difficult to do when a lot of cases um
 
01:04:52.829 --> 01:04:52.839 align:start position:0%
in some cases if there was Municipal
 
01:04:54.910 --> 01:04:54.920 align:start position:0%
Water it cost more money to get into the
 
01:04:56.390 --> 01:04:56.400 align:start position:0%
street to get to the water then it would
 
01:04:59.269 --> 01:04:59.279 align:start position:0%
be to sprinkle the entire building um
 
01:05:01.349 --> 01:05:01.359 align:start position:0%
and you know there's not room to put
 
01:05:03.750 --> 01:05:03.760 align:start position:0%
tanks and pumps and things like that so
 
01:05:07.230 --> 01:05:07.240 align:start position:0%
what we decided to do is um say that for
 
01:05:12.069 --> 01:05:12.079 align:start position:0%
up to four units on a uh existing
 
01:05:13.549 --> 01:05:13.559 align:start position:0%
building it just needs to meet the
 
01:05:16.029 --> 01:05:16.039 align:start position:0%
existing apartment chapter so it would
 
01:05:17.789 --> 01:05:17.799 align:start position:0%
be very unlikely that it would require a
 
01:05:19.230 --> 01:05:19.240 align:start position:0%
sprinkler unless there's some really
 
01:05:20.789 --> 01:05:20.799 align:start position:0%
weird unique circumstances they're
 
01:05:22.349 --> 01:05:22.359 align:start position:0%
trying to stuff something on a like in
 
01:05:24.510 --> 01:05:24.520 align:start position:0%
an attic or down in a basement with no
 
01:05:26.349 --> 01:05:26.359 align:start position:0%
windows or something like that but
 
01:05:29.750 --> 01:05:29.760 align:start position:0%
generally speaking this would allow uh
 
01:05:33.029 --> 01:05:33.039 align:start position:0%
conversions of four units um to not have
 
01:05:36.510 --> 01:05:36.520 align:start position:0%
to had to add sprinkler systems um and
 
01:05:39.029 --> 01:05:39.039 align:start position:0%
just meet the existing chapters so that
 
01:05:40.589 --> 01:05:40.599 align:start position:0%
was probably the most debated one but I
 
01:05:42.230 --> 01:05:42.240 align:start position:0%
think we got to a good compromise we
 
01:05:44.230 --> 01:05:44.240 align:start position:0%
balance Life Safety we meet the existing
 
01:05:46.710 --> 01:05:46.720 align:start position:0%
codes um so we have a benchmark for
 
01:05:49.470 --> 01:05:49.480 align:start position:0%
safety I think there the rest of it uh
 
01:05:50.990 --> 01:05:51.000 align:start position:0%
amendments were carry forward amendments
 
01:05:54.230 --> 01:05:54.240 align:start position:0%
and some cleanup of existing um you
 
01:05:56.230 --> 01:05:56.240 align:start position:0%
remember crop mazes we've we pulled out
 
01:05:58.470 --> 01:05:58.480 align:start position:0%
quite some time ago we removed Board of
 
01:06:00.230 --> 01:06:00.240 align:start position:0%
appeal language and let that fall back
 
01:06:03.309 --> 01:06:03.319 align:start position:0%
to the locals uh we we maintain some
 
01:06:05.269 --> 01:06:05.279 align:start position:0%
language on the frequency of existing
 
01:06:07.589 --> 01:06:07.599 align:start position:0%
inspections in the 2018 they came up
 
01:06:09.549 --> 01:06:09.559 align:start position:0%
with a a schedule of required
 
01:06:11.430 --> 01:06:11.440 align:start position:0%
inspections so last year we took it out
 
01:06:12.870 --> 01:06:12.880 align:start position:0%
figuring that that should be a decision
 
01:06:15.230 --> 01:06:15.240 align:start position:0%
for the locals based on Staffing and
 
01:06:17.150 --> 01:06:17.160 align:start position:0%
decisions that the town makes but the
 
01:06:20.430 --> 01:06:20.440 align:start position:0%
guidance was there um we did some uh
 
01:06:22.390 --> 01:06:22.400 align:start position:0%
last year or two years ago we did some
 
01:06:24.750 --> 01:06:24.760 align:start position:0%
language on solar to help make it easier
 
01:06:26.750 --> 01:06:26.760 align:start position:0%
to put solar on roofs in New Hampshire
 
01:06:28.190 --> 01:06:28.200 align:start position:0%
we've maintained that langu which so
 
01:06:29.710 --> 01:06:29.720 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of M the kind of
 
01:06:32.589 --> 01:06:32.599 align:start position:0%
maintaining existing so I H I can go
 
01:06:34.390 --> 01:06:34.400 align:start position:0%
through it all but uh I can share it in
 
01:06:36.430 --> 01:06:36.440 align:start position:0%
an email if you'd like the a little bit
 
01:06:38.670 --> 01:06:38.680 align:start position:0%
more of the detail um and I'm happy to
 
01:06:40.309 --> 01:06:40.319 align:start position:0%
answer any questions but so that that's
 
01:06:41.549 --> 01:06:41.559 align:start position:0%
kind of the highlights I hope you can
 
01:06:44.750 --> 01:06:44.760 align:start position:0%
support moving forward to the 2021 helps
 
01:06:46.549 --> 01:06:46.559 align:start position:0%
us keep Pace with the technology Keeps
 
01:06:48.390 --> 01:06:48.400 align:start position:0%
Us in Pace with that kind of staying
 
01:06:51.589 --> 01:06:51.599 align:start position:0%
threeyear behind cycle um so happy to
 
01:06:53.349 --> 01:06:53.359 align:start position:0%
answer any questions that you may have
 
01:06:54.750 --> 01:06:54.760 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your testimony
 
01:06:58.150 --> 01:06:58.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:00.190 --> 01:07:00.200 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
01:07:04.630 --> 01:07:04.640 align:start position:0%
my question you briefly went over the
 
01:07:08.470 --> 01:07:08.480 align:start position:0%
catching up with the technology solar um
 
01:07:11.150 --> 01:07:11.160 align:start position:0%
and those uh caught my attention have
 
01:07:14.990 --> 01:07:15.000 align:start position:0%
you also looked at the storage batteries
 
01:07:16.150 --> 01:07:16.160 align:start position:0%
that the
 
01:07:19.950 --> 01:07:19.960 align:start position:0%
residential uh component
 
01:07:22.990 --> 01:07:23.000 align:start position:0%
that you know not just uh
 
01:07:25.710 --> 01:07:25.720 align:start position:0%
multi-unit but also single single Le
 
01:07:28.510 --> 01:07:28.520 align:start position:0%
family with that has there been any
 
01:07:32.990 --> 01:07:33.000 align:start position:0%
adjustment to presence of backup battery
 
01:07:36.190 --> 01:07:36.200 align:start position:0%
solar other components that have added
 
01:07:39.470 --> 01:07:39.480 align:start position:0%
to the mix sure thank you so we did uh
 
01:07:41.349 --> 01:07:41.359 align:start position:0%
adopt trying to see you but the things
 
01:07:45.269 --> 01:07:45.279 align:start position:0%
in the way sorry uh we did adopt NFP 855
 
01:07:47.510 --> 01:07:47.520 align:start position:0%
as part of the package in the last cycle
 
01:07:49.269 --> 01:07:49.279 align:start position:0%
which addresses commercial and has a
 
01:07:51.510 --> 01:07:51.520 align:start position:0%
residential component for uh energy
 
01:07:54.510 --> 01:07:54.520 align:start position:0%
storage systems uh it it asks typically
 
01:07:56.789 --> 01:07:56.799 align:start position:0%
to have like a 5/8 sheetrock 1H hour
 
01:07:59.789 --> 01:07:59.799 align:start position:0%
rating and whatever space um you're uh
 
01:08:01.990 --> 01:08:02.000 align:start position:0%
putting the battery storage which is
 
01:08:03.349 --> 01:08:03.359 align:start position:0%
most of the time people putting them in
 
01:08:05.510 --> 01:08:05.520 align:start position:0%
garages and that would uh historically
 
01:08:08.510 --> 01:08:08.520 align:start position:0%
be uh sheetrocked anyways if you have up
 
01:08:10.470 --> 01:08:10.480 align:start position:0%
against living quarters so we do have
 
01:08:12.829 --> 01:08:12.839 align:start position:0%
some guidance um I will tell you it's
 
01:08:14.670 --> 01:08:14.680 align:start position:0%
not caught up with some of the current
 
01:08:17.070 --> 01:08:17.080 align:start position:0%
concerns around battery lithium ion
 
01:08:18.550 --> 01:08:18.560 align:start position:0%
batteries in general but I think we have
 
01:08:20.229 --> 01:08:20.239 align:start position:0%
a good we're in a good spot at this
 
01:08:21.789 --> 01:08:21.799 align:start position:0%
point in time for that we do have
 
01:08:24.430 --> 01:08:24.440 align:start position:0%
guidance on the books follow
 
01:08:24.440 --> 01:08:26.390 align:start position:0%
guidance on the books follow
up

01:08:26.390 --> 01:08:26.400 align:start position:0%
up
 
01:08:30.149 --> 01:08:30.159 align:start position:0%
so has the to follow up to that has the
 
01:08:34.349 --> 01:08:34.359 align:start position:0%
firefighting techniques have adopted to
 
01:08:36.910 --> 01:08:36.920 align:start position:0%
putting out battery
 
01:08:39.470 --> 01:08:39.480 align:start position:0%
fires so that wouldn't be in the code
 
01:08:41.709 --> 01:08:41.719 align:start position:0%
where um there's a lot we're learning a
 
01:08:44.630 --> 01:08:44.640 align:start position:0%
lot as a fire service about batteries um
 
01:08:46.309 --> 01:08:46.319 align:start position:0%
and there's a lot of studies going on
 
01:08:48.709 --> 01:08:48.719 align:start position:0%
nationally about batteries uh what we do
 
01:08:50.390 --> 01:08:50.400 align:start position:0%
know is it typically takes much more
 
01:08:53.349 --> 01:08:53.359 align:start position:0%
water and more time uh the batteries uh
 
01:08:54.910 --> 01:08:54.920 align:start position:0%
if they get into that thermal Runway
 
01:08:56.309 --> 01:08:56.319 align:start position:0%
State they don't typically want to go
 
01:09:00.590 --> 01:09:00.600 align:start position:0%
out so it's uh you know we know we know
 
01:09:02.189 --> 01:09:02.199 align:start position:0%
what's going on it's a more challenging
 
01:09:04.269 --> 01:09:04.279 align:start position:0%
fire I and I think that we've done a
 
01:09:05.709 --> 01:09:05.719 align:start position:0%
pretty good job in New Hampshire about
 
01:09:07.910 --> 01:09:07.920 align:start position:0%
educating that through the fire academy
 
01:09:09.709 --> 01:09:09.719 align:start position:0%
messaging through my office and through
 
01:09:10.910 --> 01:09:10.920 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Fire Chiefs
 
01:09:12.030 --> 01:09:12.040 align:start position:0%
Association and the professional
 
01:09:13.630 --> 01:09:13.640 align:start position:0%
firefighters we're just sharing out as
 
01:09:15.709 --> 01:09:15.719 align:start position:0%
much information as we can to keep our
 
01:09:18.910 --> 01:09:18.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:22.030 --> 01:09:22.040 align:start position:0%
state representative dlan thank you Mr
 
01:09:24.470 --> 01:09:24.480 align:start position:0%
chair um thank you for taking my
 
01:09:26.110 --> 01:09:26.120 align:start position:0%
question I have a
 
01:09:26.120 --> 01:09:27.309 align:start position:0%
question I have a
there's

01:09:27.309 --> 01:09:27.319 align:start position:0%
there's
 
01:09:32.269 --> 01:09:32.279 align:start position:0%
a a uh a proliferation of of what we
 
01:09:35.470 --> 01:09:35.480 align:start position:0%
call adus or additional dwelling units
 
01:09:38.590 --> 01:09:38.600 align:start position:0%
in in legislation and in
 
01:09:42.070 --> 01:09:42.080 align:start position:0%
practice what if anything do do you or
 
01:09:44.990 --> 01:09:45.000 align:start position:0%
do we need to be thinking of as more and
 
01:09:50.149 --> 01:09:50.159 align:start position:0%
more of these uh alternative structures
 
01:09:53.749 --> 01:09:53.759 align:start position:0%
uh to to be residing in uh as they
 
01:09:56.189 --> 01:09:56.199 align:start position:0%
become more popular
 
01:09:58.870 --> 01:09:58.880 align:start position:0%
more more prevalent is there anything we
 
01:10:01.590 --> 01:10:01.600 align:start position:0%
need to do to adjust our fire codes or
 
01:10:05.590 --> 01:10:05.600 align:start position:0%
or to alert uh local fire stations of
 
01:10:08.750 --> 01:10:08.760 align:start position:0%
how to how to manage uh a fire and
 
01:10:11.709 --> 01:10:11.719 align:start position:0%
something like that uh thank you I think
 
01:10:13.270 --> 01:10:13.280 align:start position:0%
we're in relatively good shape on the
 
01:10:16.189 --> 01:10:16.199 align:start position:0%
fire code side of things like I the the
 
01:10:17.590 --> 01:10:17.600 align:start position:0%
things that come to my mind in those
 
01:10:19.950 --> 01:10:19.960 align:start position:0%
situations are working smok and carbon
 
01:10:22.310 --> 01:10:22.320 align:start position:0%
monoxide alarms and and means of Escape
 
01:10:23.669 --> 01:10:23.679 align:start position:0%
right just like in the home hopefully
 
01:10:25.470 --> 01:10:25.480 align:start position:0%
that we're living in now and the our
 
01:10:27.310 --> 01:10:27.320 align:start position:0%
fire codes currently address that pretty
 
01:10:31.630 --> 01:10:31.640 align:start position:0%
well I think the the the only potential
 
01:10:34.149 --> 01:10:34.159 align:start position:0%
challenge might be is the uh requirement
 
01:10:37.149 --> 01:10:37.159 align:start position:0%
for the sprinkler system um and you know
 
01:10:39.030 --> 01:10:39.040 align:start position:0%
I think we're if we're in one dwelling
 
01:10:42.830 --> 01:10:42.840 align:start position:0%
unit and we add an Adu for say a family
 
01:10:45.910 --> 01:10:45.920 align:start position:0%
member something like that um one to two
 
01:10:49.550 --> 01:10:49.560 align:start position:0%
is easy we're covered I think the the um
 
01:10:51.470 --> 01:10:51.480 align:start position:0%
Amendment that's before us right now to
 
01:10:53.990 --> 01:10:54.000 align:start position:0%
go up to four units would uh help
 
01:10:56.270 --> 01:10:56.280 align:start position:0%
alleviate the cost around sprinklers but
 
01:10:58.310 --> 01:10:58.320 align:start position:0%
then still keep us safe CU it follows
 
01:11:00.310 --> 01:11:00.320 align:start position:0%
our existing code does that answer your
 
01:11:02.910 --> 01:11:02.920 align:start position:0%
question yes thank you thank
 
01:11:05.070 --> 01:11:05.080 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
01:11:08.790 --> 01:11:08.800 align:start position:0%
Gera thank you Mr chair so fire Marsh
 
01:11:11.430 --> 01:11:11.440 align:start position:0%
Tumi you offered to send to us a summary
 
01:11:13.870 --> 01:11:13.880 align:start position:0%
of the changes and if you could kindly
 
01:11:15.590 --> 01:11:15.600 align:start position:0%
do that I'd appreciate it I would happy
 
01:11:17.790 --> 01:11:17.800 align:start position:0%
to do that thank you thank you yes
 
01:11:19.630 --> 01:11:19.640 align:start position:0%
representative leus thank you I think I
 
01:11:21.750 --> 01:11:21.760 align:start position:0%
heard you say in passing something about
 
01:11:23.669 --> 01:11:23.679 align:start position:0%
changes related to a board of appeal
 
01:11:26.030 --> 01:11:26.040 align:start position:0%
what what was that about yeah yeah so
 
01:11:28.350 --> 01:11:28.360 align:start position:0%
the in the uh in the NFPA 1 which is
 
01:11:30.229 --> 01:11:30.239 align:start position:0%
part of the fire code there's a it
 
01:11:32.830 --> 01:11:32.840 align:start position:0%
spells out a board of appeals process
 
01:11:35.870 --> 01:11:35.880 align:start position:0%
and um we've taken that out so it can be
 
01:11:37.870 --> 01:11:37.880 align:start position:0%
dealt with at the local level someone
 
01:11:39.709 --> 01:11:39.719 align:start position:0%
can still come to a variance to my
 
01:11:41.030 --> 01:11:41.040 align:start position:0%
office and then appeal it through the
 
01:11:43.030 --> 01:11:43.040 align:start position:0%
building code review board so we still
 
01:11:44.629 --> 01:11:44.639 align:start position:0%
have that side of the process we're not
 
01:11:47.030 --> 01:11:47.040 align:start position:0%
removing any of that it's more of the
 
01:11:50.189 --> 01:11:50.199 align:start position:0%
local the local official I'm sorry the
 
01:11:53.910 --> 01:11:53.920 align:start position:0%
local uh board of appeals process so um
 
01:11:55.870 --> 01:11:55.880 align:start position:0%
that's we've reserved that for the
 
01:11:58.390 --> 01:11:58.400 align:start position:0%
locals just follow up follow up so was
 
01:12:00.270 --> 01:12:00.280 align:start position:0%
there a requirement before for some
 
01:12:02.310 --> 01:12:02.320 align:start position:0%
local board of appeals in addition to
 
01:12:07.430 --> 01:12:07.440 align:start position:0%
the the state the um there's other
 
01:12:10.390 --> 01:12:10.400 align:start position:0%
language on appeals uh in different
 
01:12:14.110 --> 01:12:14.120 align:start position:0%
parts of the statute now so um there's a
 
01:12:16.149 --> 01:12:16.159 align:start position:0%
requirement for building code uh
 
01:12:18.390 --> 01:12:18.400 align:start position:0%
building code appeals boards at the
 
01:12:20.390 --> 01:12:20.400 align:start position:0%
local level and typically it will go
 
01:12:22.470 --> 01:12:22.480 align:start position:0%
through there um sometimes that's a
 
01:12:23.950 --> 01:12:23.960 align:start position:0%
board of Selectmen sometimes that's a
 
01:12:26.310 --> 01:12:26.320 align:start position:0%
zoning board right there's there's a
 
01:12:28.910 --> 01:12:28.920 align:start position:0%
another bill that's here uh I think it's
 
01:12:31.870 --> 01:12:31.880 align:start position:0%
part of the next bill that will have um
 
01:12:35.629 --> 01:12:35.639 align:start position:0%
if the bill if the the the code appeal
 
01:12:39.350 --> 01:12:39.360 align:start position:0%
stuff goes to uh like a zba instead it
 
01:12:40.470 --> 01:12:40.480 align:start position:0%
would might potentially go to the
 
01:12:41.990 --> 01:12:42.000 align:start position:0%
building code review board for someone
 
01:12:43.870 --> 01:12:43.880 align:start position:0%
that would be more uh familiar with the
 
01:12:46.070 --> 01:12:46.080 align:start position:0%
code process rather than um someone that
 
01:12:47.470 --> 01:12:47.480 align:start position:0%
doesn't have familiar with the code
 
01:12:49.669 --> 01:12:49.679 align:start position:0%
process so there's local systems in
 
01:12:52.350 --> 01:12:52.360 align:start position:0%
place it was just trying to not have uh
 
01:12:54.350 --> 01:12:54.360 align:start position:0%
overlap or conflicting documentation
 
01:12:56.270 --> 01:12:56.280 align:start position:0%
that's been out for a long a long long
 
01:12:57.870 --> 01:12:57.880 align:start position:0%
time all right thank
 
01:13:00.110 --> 01:13:00.120 align:start position:0%
you yes representative
 
01:13:03.390 --> 01:13:03.400 align:start position:0%
Goldie thank you Mr chair um thank you
 
01:13:05.270 --> 01:13:05.280 align:start position:0%
for being here just one quick question
 
01:13:08.350 --> 01:13:08.360 align:start position:0%
this uh deals with all the Amendments uh
 
01:13:10.510 --> 01:13:10.520 align:start position:0%
as of September 20th there hasn't been
 
01:13:12.070 --> 01:13:12.080 align:start position:0%
any other after that has there that we
 
01:13:13.750 --> 01:13:13.760 align:start position:0%
need to include correct we haven't done
 
01:13:16.270 --> 01:13:16.280 align:start position:0%
any additional amendments at this
 
01:13:19.149 --> 01:13:19.159 align:start position:0%
time any other questions yes
 
01:13:24.110 --> 01:13:24.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:26.470 --> 01:13:26.480 align:start position:0%
chairman is there any metrics to
 
01:13:28.590 --> 01:13:28.600 align:start position:0%
determine if increasing the stringency
 
01:13:31.149 --> 01:13:31.159 align:start position:0%
of the fire code is decreasing property
 
01:13:33.870 --> 01:13:33.880 align:start position:0%
damage and deaths or it's just something
 
01:13:35.390 --> 01:13:35.400 align:start position:0%
we we feel we need to do because
 
01:13:37.189 --> 01:13:37.199 align:start position:0%
everyone else is doing it I'm just
 
01:13:41.390 --> 01:13:41.400 align:start position:0%
curious um so that's a tough one right
 
01:13:41.400 --> 01:13:42.950 align:start position:0%
curious um so that's a tough one right
um

01:13:42.950 --> 01:13:42.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:13:45.149 --> 01:13:45.159 align:start position:0%
NFPA is probably the National Fire
 
01:13:46.510 --> 01:13:46.520 align:start position:0%
Protection Association is probably the
 
01:13:49.550 --> 01:13:49.560 align:start position:0%
best to attract uh historical data um
 
01:13:51.669 --> 01:13:51.679 align:start position:0%
which is based on uh incident reporting
 
01:13:54.669 --> 01:13:54.679 align:start position:0%
from the local fire departments and uh
 
01:13:56.550 --> 01:13:56.560 align:start position:0%
and many many cases code changes we can
 
01:14:00.149 --> 01:14:00.159 align:start position:0%
see is a steep decline in uh dollar loss
 
01:14:02.629 --> 01:14:02.639 align:start position:0%
and uh injuries and deaths um and
 
01:14:05.110 --> 01:14:05.120 align:start position:0%
there's charts for each of the different
 
01:14:09.229 --> 01:14:09.239 align:start position:0%
occupancies um you'll on the sprinkler
 
01:14:10.830 --> 01:14:10.840 align:start position:0%
requirement which I I think that bill is
 
01:14:12.350 --> 01:14:12.360 align:start position:0%
going to come to you guys at some point
 
01:14:13.830 --> 01:14:13.840 align:start position:0%
there's a separate bill on the sprinkler
 
01:14:15.709 --> 01:14:15.719 align:start position:0%
for three and four family one of the
 
01:14:18.350 --> 01:14:18.360 align:start position:0%
decision points on why we chose to do
 
01:14:20.390 --> 01:14:20.400 align:start position:0%
the three and four fam is that that
 
01:14:22.590 --> 01:14:22.600 align:start position:0%
curve has essentially been flat when you
 
01:14:26.830 --> 01:14:26.840 align:start position:0%
did the um sprinkler versus the when
 
01:14:28.830 --> 01:14:28.840 align:start position:0%
when the sprinkler requirement came in
 
01:14:30.790 --> 01:14:30.800 align:start position:0%
when the when smoke alarms came into
 
01:14:32.910 --> 01:14:32.920 align:start position:0%
play in the 70s we saw a steep decline
 
01:14:35.629 --> 01:14:35.639 align:start position:0%
in the deaths around uh in residential
 
01:14:38.830 --> 01:14:38.840 align:start position:0%
structures so um I think some you see a
 
01:14:42.310 --> 01:14:42.320 align:start position:0%
greater return quicker um and others you
 
01:14:43.870 --> 01:14:43.880 align:start position:0%
don't but there there's there is some
 
01:14:46.030 --> 01:14:46.040 align:start position:0%
data I can share this I can share the
 
01:14:49.229 --> 01:14:49.239 align:start position:0%
reports with you uh if you if you'd like
 
01:14:51.750 --> 01:14:51.760 align:start position:0%
uh followup followup I appreciate that
 
01:14:53.430 --> 01:14:53.440 align:start position:0%
but is this New Hampshire specific or
 
01:14:55.510 --> 01:14:55.520 align:start position:0%
this is more National based uh New
 
01:14:57.510 --> 01:14:57.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh National basee we don't we
 
01:14:59.110 --> 01:14:59.120 align:start position:0%
don't we haven't drilled into that uh
 
01:15:00.550 --> 01:15:00.560 align:start position:0%
local it's something we're trying to
 
01:15:02.709 --> 01:15:02.719 align:start position:0%
start working on now uh we have a
 
01:15:04.709 --> 01:15:04.719 align:start position:0%
part-time data person they barely keep
 
01:15:07.070 --> 01:15:07.080 align:start position:0%
up with just shifting the stuff to the
 
01:15:08.790 --> 01:15:08.800 align:start position:0%
US fire Administration for their stuff
 
01:15:11.070 --> 01:15:11.080 align:start position:0%
so I appreciate I just my personal
 
01:15:12.950 --> 01:15:12.960 align:start position:0%
concern is that this is a major
 
01:15:14.790 --> 01:15:14.800 align:start position:0%
financial burden on some people and I
 
01:15:16.470 --> 01:15:16.480 align:start position:0%
just want to know that there is actual
 
01:15:18.990 --> 01:15:19.000 align:start position:0%
return versus just sure so thank you I
 
01:15:21.430 --> 01:15:21.440 align:start position:0%
don't I would you're welcome I don't um
 
01:15:22.950 --> 01:15:22.960 align:start position:0%
one of the things we consider obviously
 
01:15:24.229 --> 01:15:24.239 align:start position:0%
in the amendment process and the
 
01:15:26.910 --> 01:15:26.920 align:start position:0%
adoption process is looking at the costs
 
01:15:30.709 --> 01:15:30.719 align:start position:0%
uh there's um you know we don't
 
01:15:32.149 --> 01:15:32.159 align:start position:0%
anticipate it's very difficult to figure
 
01:15:33.669 --> 01:15:33.679 align:start position:0%
out the exact cost but unlike the
 
01:15:35.110 --> 01:15:35.120 align:start position:0%
building code and the energy code
 
01:15:37.149 --> 01:15:37.159 align:start position:0%
conversations we've had right we don't I
 
01:15:39.270 --> 01:15:39.280 align:start position:0%
can't point to one one thing other than
 
01:15:41.550 --> 01:15:41.560 align:start position:0%
the ones we took out the sprinklers uh
 
01:15:43.229 --> 01:15:43.239 align:start position:0%
of saying this is going to be a big
 
01:15:47.189 --> 01:15:47.199 align:start position:0%
increase in cost for developers um if we
 
01:15:48.990 --> 01:15:49.000 align:start position:0%
add for the sprinklers for like the bars
 
01:15:50.270 --> 01:15:50.280 align:start position:0%
and restaurants that would be a big
 
01:15:51.830 --> 01:15:51.840 align:start position:0%
change especially in areas in our state
 
01:15:54.510 --> 01:15:54.520 align:start position:0%
that have no Municipal Water um and the
 
01:15:56.390 --> 01:15:56.400 align:start position:0%
daycare would have a big impact on the
 
01:15:59.790 --> 01:15:59.800 align:start position:0%
availability of child care and um I have
 
01:16:04.350 --> 01:16:04.360 align:start position:0%
a sick half sickish kid with me but um
 
01:16:06.590 --> 01:16:06.600 align:start position:0%
uh you know the child care thing is a
 
01:16:08.990 --> 01:16:09.000 align:start position:0%
big issue right so if we add burden to
 
01:16:10.629 --> 01:16:10.639 align:start position:0%
the sprinkler requirement on something
 
01:16:12.830 --> 01:16:12.840 align:start position:0%
that's been pretty safe for years Based
 
01:16:15.149 --> 01:16:15.159 align:start position:0%
on data um that's why we backed it off
 
01:16:16.510 --> 01:16:16.520 align:start position:0%
so I think we do a pretty good job on
 
01:16:18.709 --> 01:16:18.719 align:start position:0%
the fire cat side of um balancing all
 
01:16:23.470 --> 01:16:23.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:25.390 --> 01:16:25.400 align:start position:0%
you any other question questions yes
 
01:16:25.400 --> 01:16:27.510 align:start position:0%
you any other question questions yes
representative

01:16:27.510 --> 01:16:27.520 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:16:30.470 --> 01:16:30.480 align:start position:0%
Schmidt thank you Mr chairman uh good
 
01:16:34.669 --> 01:16:34.679 align:start position:0%
morning for Marshall so
 
01:16:39.390 --> 01:16:39.400 align:start position:0%
uh are we seeing a um
 
01:16:42.350 --> 01:16:42.360 align:start position:0%
a kind of a steady situation with fires
 
01:16:44.070 --> 01:16:44.080 align:start position:0%
or are we seeing that the number of
 
01:16:47.070 --> 01:16:47.080 align:start position:0%
fires is going down as people for
 
01:16:49.550 --> 01:16:49.560 align:start position:0%
example one of the one of the things is
 
01:16:52.990 --> 01:16:53.000 align:start position:0%
uh smoking was was a very frequent cause
 
01:16:55.110 --> 01:16:55.120 align:start position:0%
of fires right people fall asleep in bed
 
01:16:59.830 --> 01:16:59.840 align:start position:0%
with a cigarette burn their house down
 
01:17:03.189 --> 01:17:03.199 align:start position:0%
uh people's habits are changing a
 
01:17:06.910 --> 01:17:06.920 align:start position:0%
lot so are we seeing a result uh I I
 
01:17:11.030 --> 01:17:11.040 align:start position:0%
remember seeing um neighbors of mine
 
01:17:13.910 --> 01:17:13.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:16.990 --> 01:17:17.000 align:start position:0%
smokers he he would they'd come outside
 
01:17:19.229 --> 01:17:19.239 align:start position:0%
after a while I see them come outside to
 
01:17:22.070 --> 01:17:22.080 align:start position:0%
smoke then they stop
 
01:17:26.910 --> 01:17:26.920 align:start position:0%
smoking um and so can you speak to that
 
01:17:29.430 --> 01:17:29.440 align:start position:0%
issue sure so generally speaking I would
 
01:17:33.430 --> 01:17:33.440 align:start position:0%
say fires are down um we see about
 
01:17:35.510 --> 01:17:35.520 align:start position:0%
approximately 12 fire fatalities in New
 
01:17:38.750 --> 01:17:38.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire each year um our fire losses
 
01:17:41.070 --> 01:17:41.080 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire generally now uh either
 
01:17:44.550 --> 01:17:44.560 align:start position:0%
heating related or cooking related um
 
01:17:46.790 --> 01:17:46.800 align:start position:0%
and largely when we see the the
 
01:17:48.870 --> 01:17:48.880 align:start position:0%
fatalities it's uh unfortunately due to
 
01:17:52.390 --> 01:17:52.400 align:start position:0%
lack of working smoke alarms um but
 
01:17:54.229 --> 01:17:54.239 align:start position:0%
Heating and cooking tend to be our our
 
01:17:56.709 --> 01:17:56.719 align:start position:0%
biggies and New Hampshire but um there
 
01:17:59.790 --> 01:17:59.800 align:start position:0%
is a sort of a maybe a little bit of
 
01:18:02.350 --> 01:18:02.360 align:start position:0%
upward Trend uh nationally that we're
 
01:18:05.229 --> 01:18:05.239 align:start position:0%
looking at and concerned with and it's
 
01:18:07.990 --> 01:18:08.000 align:start position:0%
um you know we talk about the batteries
 
01:18:09.430 --> 01:18:09.440 align:start position:0%
issues that we're watching closely to
 
01:18:11.910 --> 01:18:11.920 align:start position:0%
see what that's going to do um you know
 
01:18:14.550 --> 01:18:14.560 align:start position:0%
the the changes in construction types
 
01:18:16.070 --> 01:18:16.080 align:start position:0%
and and the progression of how fast
 
01:18:18.830 --> 01:18:18.840 align:start position:0%
fires move uh changes in furniture and
 
01:18:21.229 --> 01:18:21.239 align:start position:0%
and things like that that the synthetics
 
01:18:24.149 --> 01:18:24.159 align:start position:0%
uh burn quicker so you know it's a lot
 
01:18:26.550 --> 01:18:26.560 align:start position:0%
of these things take time uh for them to
 
01:18:29.750 --> 01:18:29.760 align:start position:0%
vet out but um I would say generally
 
01:18:31.629 --> 01:18:31.639 align:start position:0%
over the last several decades we've seen
 
01:18:34.910 --> 01:18:34.920 align:start position:0%
an a downward Trend and and fire loss uh
 
01:18:36.470 --> 01:18:36.480 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire fire ad fire
 
01:18:38.590 --> 01:18:38.600 align:start position:0%
department's largely response to Medical
 
01:18:41.310 --> 01:18:41.320 align:start position:0%
calls at this point not fire calls um
 
01:18:47.270 --> 01:18:47.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:51.149 --> 01:18:51.159 align:start position:0%
enough so uh so some of that is it would
 
01:18:53.390 --> 01:18:53.400 align:start position:0%
be in response to people's habits
 
01:18:58.430 --> 01:18:58.440 align:start position:0%
changing but also uh I mean I know I see
 
01:19:02.310 --> 01:19:02.320 align:start position:0%
on I'm online a lot I see on YouTube I
 
01:19:05.510 --> 01:19:05.520 align:start position:0%
see tremendous amount of advertising for
 
01:19:08.350 --> 01:19:08.360 align:start position:0%
all kinds of gear to protect yourself
 
01:19:11.709 --> 01:19:11.719 align:start position:0%
from everything imaginable um and one of
 
01:19:14.870 --> 01:19:14.880 align:start position:0%
the things obviously out there is home
 
01:19:18.950 --> 01:19:18.960 align:start position:0%
uh not only smoke detectors but also uh
 
01:19:23.750 --> 01:19:23.760 align:start position:0%
fire suppression equipment uh and can
 
01:19:25.229 --> 01:19:25.239 align:start position:0%
you can you different
 
01:19:27.709 --> 01:19:27.719 align:start position:0%
differentiate between the difference
 
01:19:31.110 --> 01:19:31.120 align:start position:0%
between individual habits changing for
 
01:19:35.189 --> 01:19:35.199 align:start position:0%
example number smokers is going down uh
 
01:19:39.870 --> 01:19:39.880 align:start position:0%
but also um stuff like fire
 
01:19:43.350 --> 01:19:43.360 align:start position:0%
extinguishers and so forth and the I see
 
01:19:46.229 --> 01:19:46.239 align:start position:0%
this thing where they got this
 
01:19:49.110 --> 01:19:49.120 align:start position:0%
cloth that you throw on the fire on the
 
01:19:54.270 --> 01:19:54.280 align:start position:0%
pan that's on fire right uh so new gear
 
01:19:56.510 --> 01:19:56.520 align:start position:0%
uh so can you speak to that just getting
 
01:19:59.229 --> 01:19:59.239 align:start position:0%
off subject here to the fire code I I i'
 
01:20:00.990 --> 01:20:01.000 align:start position:0%
would agree with that I'm not sure

today were appropriate to this uh to
 
01:23:16.990 --> 01:23:17.000 align:start position:0%
this bill first of all we've agreed to
 
01:23:19.310 --> 01:23:19.320 align:start position:0%
stay one Cod behind on the fire codes
 
01:23:21.189 --> 01:23:21.199 align:start position:0%
and this will put us exactly where we
 
01:23:25.189 --> 01:23:25.199 align:start position:0%
need to be the other is that the um
 
01:23:27.350 --> 01:23:27.360 align:start position:0%
codes and the the ratification and
 
01:23:31.430 --> 01:23:31.440 align:start position:0%
revisions were considered in lie of the
 
01:23:35.709 --> 01:23:35.719 align:start position:0%
um business climate and the uh
 
01:23:38.270 --> 01:23:38.280 align:start position:0%
residential needs of the people of New
 
01:23:41.950 --> 01:23:41.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so with those two um important
 
01:23:43.830 --> 01:23:43.840 align:start position:0%
um and I like the fact that the the
 
01:23:45.750 --> 01:23:45.760 align:start position:0%
board of appeal was moved to a local
 
01:23:48.470 --> 01:23:48.480 align:start position:0%
level so these are all reasons why we
 
01:23:50.709 --> 01:23:50.719 align:start position:0%

01:31:05.470 --> 01:31:05.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:09.310 --> 01:31:09.320 align:start position:0%
have in our State Building uh codes um
 
01:31:13.229 --> 01:31:13.239 align:start position:0%
it was a hardfought bill a lot of
 
01:31:16.910 --> 01:31:16.920 align:start position:0%
compromise and uh it eventually passed
 
01:31:18.830 --> 01:31:18.840 align:start position:0%
and the governor signed that particular
 
01:31:21.390 --> 01:31:21.400 align:start position:0%
bill into law but what happened was
 
01:31:24.109 --> 01:31:24.119 align:start position:0%
there was a window between the time time
 
01:31:28.229 --> 01:31:28.239 align:start position:0%
it was signed into law and the time um
 
01:31:31.430 --> 01:31:31.440 align:start position:0%
that it became effective and what I
 
01:31:33.350 --> 01:31:33.360 align:start position:0%
discovered because it was brought to my
 
01:31:36.470 --> 01:31:36.480 align:start position:0%
attention that some municipalities took
 
01:31:40.109 --> 01:31:40.119 align:start position:0%
advantage of that time frame that a
 
01:31:44.390 --> 01:31:44.400 align:start position:0%
couple of months and passed a lot of um
 
01:31:47.310 --> 01:31:47.320 align:start position:0%
local ordinances concerning the state
 
01:31:49.990 --> 01:31:50.000 align:start position:0%
their version of the State Building Code
 
01:31:53.270 --> 01:31:53.280 align:start position:0%
in my opinion that was something that
 
01:31:58.189 --> 01:31:58.199 align:start position:0%
was not appropriate the bill was signed
 
01:32:00.590 --> 01:32:00.600 align:start position:0%
it just had not taken effective and I
 
01:32:03.669 --> 01:32:03.679 align:start position:0%
felt that the municipalities that did
 
01:32:08.790 --> 01:32:08.800 align:start position:0%
this took an unfair um advantage of that
 
01:32:12.430 --> 01:32:12.440 align:start position:0%
time period especially when um we were
 
01:32:14.990 --> 01:32:15.000 align:start position:0%
working on the bill and they had come in
 
01:32:18.310 --> 01:32:18.320 align:start position:0%
and asked for that time period not to
 
01:32:20.189 --> 01:32:20.199 align:start position:0%
have it take effect
 
01:32:23.510 --> 01:32:23.520 align:start position:0%
immediately so um that's one reason why
 
01:32:26.229 --> 01:32:26.239 align:start position:0%
I filed um Senate Bill
 
01:32:30.149 --> 01:32:30.159 align:start position:0%
437 I felt it was entirely inappropriate
 
01:32:31.709 --> 01:32:31.719 align:start position:0%
for them to do
 
01:32:31.719 --> 01:32:33.310 align:start position:0%
for them to do
this

01:32:33.310 --> 01:32:33.320 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:32:36.189 --> 01:32:36.199 align:start position:0%
um the other thing and if you remember
 
01:32:39.270 --> 01:32:39.280 align:start position:0%
about that original legislation what it
 
01:32:42.310 --> 01:32:42.320 align:start position:0%
did was it said look you can adopt these
 
01:32:45.709 --> 01:32:45.719 align:start position:0%
local codes but if you're going to do
 
01:32:48.830 --> 01:32:48.840 align:start position:0%
that before you put them on a ballot or
 
01:32:51.870 --> 01:32:51.880 align:start position:0%
you adopt them submit them to the to the
 
01:32:54.350 --> 01:32:54.360 align:start position:0%
State Building Code review board they
 
01:32:57.590 --> 01:32:57.600 align:start position:0%
can look at them they can't tell you
 
01:33:00.390 --> 01:33:00.400 align:start position:0%
that you can't adopt them but as you
 
01:33:03.229 --> 01:33:03.239 align:start position:0%
know the uh State Building Code review
 
01:33:05.830 --> 01:33:05.840 align:start position:0%
board they're responsible for putting
 
01:33:09.350 --> 01:33:09.360 align:start position:0%
all of these together and anyone and
 
01:33:12.430 --> 01:33:12.440 align:start position:0%
Builders electricians plumbers they look
 
01:33:15.390 --> 01:33:15.400 align:start position:0%
at that because those are the building
 
01:33:18.189 --> 01:33:18.199 align:start position:0%
codes and if a municipality is going to
 
01:33:20.830 --> 01:33:20.840 align:start position:0%
go beyond that they should also know
 
01:33:23.350 --> 01:33:23.360 align:start position:0%
that as well and the State Building Code
 
01:33:26.350 --> 01:33:26.360 align:start position:0%
review board is the Clearing House it's
 
01:33:29.470 --> 01:33:29.480 align:start position:0%
the place where people go to find
 
01:33:33.270 --> 01:33:33.280 align:start position:0%
information so you know again that's why
 
01:33:37.189 --> 01:33:37.199 align:start position:0%
that original bill was filed so let me
 
01:33:39.910 --> 01:33:39.920 align:start position:0%
talk a little bit more about this um
 
01:33:42.709 --> 01:33:42.719 align:start position:0%
Bill the main purpose of this bill and
 
01:33:45.109 --> 01:33:45.119 align:start position:0%
the accompanying amendment is to clarify
 
01:33:47.430 --> 01:33:47.440 align:start position:0%
the rsas that are in place now with
 
01:33:50.030 --> 01:33:50.040 align:start position:0%
regards to following the State Building
 
01:33:52.510 --> 01:33:52.520 align:start position:0%
Code so that it follows the intent of
 
01:33:54.950 --> 01:33:54.960 align:start position:0%
the legislature at the time it was
 
01:33:57.830 --> 01:33:57.840 align:start position:0%
passed this bill requires all local
 
01:33:59.910 --> 01:33:59.920 align:start position:0%
ordinances amending the state building
 
01:34:02.790 --> 01:34:02.800 align:start position:0%
code to comply with the procedures in
 
01:34:05.629 --> 01:34:05.639 align:start position:0%
law for review and approval of
 
01:34:07.990 --> 01:34:08.000 align:start position:0%
additional local regulations to the
 
01:34:09.629 --> 01:34:09.639 align:start position:0%
State Building
 
01:34:14.109 --> 01:34:14.119 align:start position:0%
Code excuse me it also closes loopholes
 
01:34:17.990 --> 01:34:18.000 align:start position:0%
allowing for entire codes to be adopted
 
01:34:20.189 --> 01:34:20.199 align:start position:0%
with disregard to the most recently
 
01:34:23.510 --> 01:34:23.520 align:start position:0%
adopted State Building Codes now all of
 
01:34:25.750 --> 01:34:25.760 align:start position:0%
you you know because we have a bill in
 
01:34:28.390 --> 01:34:28.400 align:start position:0%
Edna concerning an update of the
 
01:34:30.629 --> 01:34:30.639 align:start position:0%
building code um the build State
 
01:34:33.709 --> 01:34:33.719 align:start position:0%
Building Codes we are two years behind
 
01:34:36.669 --> 01:34:36.679 align:start position:0%
this is something that the Senate Edna
 
01:34:40.510 --> 01:34:40.520 align:start position:0%
and house Edna at the time agreed upon
 
01:34:42.790 --> 01:34:42.800 align:start position:0%
because what was happening they were
 
01:34:46.510 --> 01:34:46.520 align:start position:0%
lagging far beyond two years and there
 
01:34:49.310 --> 01:34:49.320 align:start position:0%
were some serious ramifications for that
 
01:34:53.310 --> 01:34:53.320 align:start position:0%
lag including um higher Insurance costs
 
01:34:55.310 --> 01:34:55.320 align:start position:0%
on buildings because they were not
 
01:34:57.510 --> 01:34:57.520 align:start position:0%
building they especially commercial
 
01:34:59.950 --> 01:34:59.960 align:start position:0%
buildings were not being built to
 
01:35:02.350 --> 01:35:02.360 align:start position:0%
updated codes and because of that it was
 
01:35:04.590 --> 01:35:04.600 align:start position:0%
costing people who own commercial
 
01:35:08.709 --> 01:35:08.719 align:start position:0%
buildings more money in their in their
 
01:35:12.149 --> 01:35:12.159 align:start position:0%
insurance for the buildings so between
 
01:35:14.470 --> 01:35:14.480 align:start position:0%
your chair and myself who chaired our
 
01:35:17.870 --> 01:35:17.880 align:start position:0%
Senate Edna at a time we created a
 
01:35:22.030 --> 01:35:22.040 align:start position:0%
method and it it's worked there's no
 
01:35:24.750 --> 01:35:24.760 align:start position:0%
fighting there's no ARG arguing they
 
01:35:26.629 --> 01:35:26.639 align:start position:0%
work it out and then they come to the
 
01:35:29.229 --> 01:35:29.239 align:start position:0%
legislature with what they've what
 
01:35:32.030 --> 01:35:32.040 align:start position:0%
they've worked on and this committee has
 
01:35:36.510 --> 01:35:36.520 align:start position:0%
passed them as well as uh Senate
 
01:35:42.510 --> 01:35:42.520 align:start position:0%
Edna so um again um I I digress a little
 
01:35:45.550 --> 01:35:45.560 align:start position:0%
bit because I was really kind of
 
01:35:49.669 --> 01:35:49.679 align:start position:0%
concerned at the Brazen behavior that
 
01:35:51.669 --> 01:35:51.679 align:start position:0%
had occurred during that small time
 
01:35:54.470 --> 01:35:54.480 align:start position:0%
period where some municipal alties just
 
01:35:57.790 --> 01:35:57.800 align:start position:0%
adopted State Building Codes the whole
 
01:36:01.470 --> 01:36:01.480 align:start position:0%
thing an updated version that is
 
01:36:05.270 --> 01:36:05.280 align:start position:0%
contrary to what this legislature
 
01:36:08.189 --> 01:36:08.199 align:start position:0%
adopted we know that the building codes
 
01:36:09.629 --> 01:36:09.639 align:start position:0%
come through
 
01:36:14.350 --> 01:36:14.360 align:start position:0%
here so anyway there's also conern uh
 
01:36:17.390 --> 01:36:17.400 align:start position:0%
consistency in wording and location when
 
01:36:19.550 --> 01:36:19.560 align:start position:0%
looking at the bill there were a few
 
01:36:21.950 --> 01:36:21.960 align:start position:0%
locations throughout New Hampshire's
 
01:36:24.669 --> 01:36:24.679 align:start position:0%
rsas that touch on the requirements
 
01:36:26.830 --> 01:36:26.840 align:start position:0%
which allow adoption of
 
01:36:30.270 --> 01:36:30.280 align:start position:0%
additional uh codes or amendments this
 
01:36:32.149 --> 01:36:32.159 align:start position:0%
particular Bill attempts to make the
 
01:36:34.990 --> 01:36:35.000 align:start position:0%
wording consistent and then simplifies
 
01:36:38.229 --> 01:36:38.239 align:start position:0%
where to find the wording in the law by
 
01:36:40.430 --> 01:36:40.440 align:start position:0%
using RSA
 
01:36:46.590 --> 01:36:46.600 align:start position:0%
474 colon 51 and 47 colon 22 both which
 
01:36:49.270 --> 01:36:49.280 align:start position:0%
Define The Authority given to local
 
01:36:51.709 --> 01:36:51.719 align:start position:0%
municipalities these two sections Define
 
01:36:54.709 --> 01:36:54.719 align:start position:0%
the intent and then it simply
 
01:36:57.669 --> 01:36:57.679 align:start position:0%
refers any other locations where this
 
01:37:00.669 --> 01:37:00.679 align:start position:0%
Authority is mentioned back to them
 
01:37:03.270 --> 01:37:03.280 align:start position:0%
again it's about the
 
01:37:05.870 --> 01:37:05.880 align:start position:0%
consistency um and it also assists the
 
01:37:08.629 --> 01:37:08.639 align:start position:0%
Fire Marshall to comply with recent
 
01:37:10.629 --> 01:37:10.639 align:start position:0%
legislation it will Aid the fire
 
01:37:13.430 --> 01:37:13.440 align:start position:0%
Marshall's office to accomplish the tax
 
01:37:16.750 --> 01:37:16.760 align:start position:0%
task it was given by recent legislation
 
01:37:20.270 --> 01:37:20.280 align:start position:0%
which is to catalog and list all local
 
01:37:23.669 --> 01:37:23.679 align:start position:0%
city town and Municipal amendments on on
 
01:37:26.189 --> 01:37:26.199 align:start position:0%
the brbc website which is the build and
 
01:37:28.830 --> 01:37:28.840 align:start position:0%
code review board this bill will
 
01:37:31.669 --> 01:37:31.679 align:start position:0%
accomplish this by effectively hitting
 
01:37:34.750 --> 01:37:34.760 align:start position:0%
the reset button and allowing for a
 
01:37:38.950 --> 01:37:38.960 align:start position:0%
fresh start for the process um this
 
01:37:40.790 --> 01:37:40.800 align:start position:0%
amendment was a collaborative the
 
01:37:42.910 --> 01:37:42.920 align:start position:0%
amendment was a collaborative effort
 
01:37:45.390 --> 01:37:45.400 align:start position:0%
from many of the stakeholders and I hope
 
01:37:48.149 --> 01:37:48.159 align:start position:0%
that this amendment will address their
 
01:37:50.589 --> 01:37:50.599 align:start position:0%
concerns I will at this point conclude
 
01:37:52.950 --> 01:37:52.960 align:start position:0%
my testimony and if you have any
 
01:37:55.430 --> 01:37:55.440 align:start position:0%
questions I will try to answer them
 
01:37:56.629 --> 01:37:56.639 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony are there
 
01:37:58.709 --> 01:37:58.719 align:start position:0%
any questions yes representative leus
 
01:38:02.270 --> 01:38:02.280 align:start position:0%
thank you and uh welcome Senator um so
 
01:38:05.109 --> 01:38:05.119 align:start position:0%
first of all and I think I'm hoping the
 
01:38:07.950 --> 01:38:07.960 align:start position:0%
answer to this is no but does this allow
 
01:38:09.510 --> 01:38:09.520 align:start position:0%
and separate from the issue of the Gap
 
01:38:11.270 --> 01:38:11.280 align:start position:0%
and what was done during the Gap does
 
01:38:14.629 --> 01:38:14.639 align:start position:0%
this allow municipalities to make any
 
01:38:15.950 --> 01:38:15.960 align:start position:0%
amendments to the building code that
 
01:38:17.990 --> 01:38:18.000 align:start position:0%
were not you know they they can't do
 
01:38:20.310 --> 01:38:20.320 align:start position:0%
under current law does it expand that in
 
01:38:23.669 --> 01:38:23.679 align:start position:0%
any way no what this bill does is it
 
01:38:26.550 --> 01:38:26.560 align:start position:0%
looks at that Gap period And basically
 
01:38:29.229 --> 01:38:29.239 align:start position:0%
says no no no you shouldn't have done
 
01:38:31.790 --> 01:38:31.800 align:start position:0%
that and make them go through this
 
01:38:34.070 --> 01:38:34.080 align:start position:0%
process that was outlined in the
 
01:38:36.229 --> 01:38:36.239 align:start position:0%
legislation that was signed but it
 
01:38:39.229 --> 01:38:39.239 align:start position:0%
hadn't taken effect yet follow up follow
 
01:38:42.669 --> 01:38:42.679 align:start position:0%
up okay and um the way I read it and
 
01:38:44.070 --> 01:38:44.080 align:start position:0%
again I'm looking for
 
01:38:46.669 --> 01:38:46.679 align:start position:0%
confirmation um a municipality could not
 
01:38:49.589 --> 01:38:49.599 align:start position:0%
adopt a whole chunk of exist of building
 
01:38:51.750 --> 01:38:51.760 align:start position:0%
code for example I don't know what the
 
01:38:53.109 --> 01:38:53.119 align:start position:0%
Senate's going to do or if they've acted
 
01:38:55.629 --> 01:38:55.639 align:start position:0%
on it but but we chose not to adopt the
 
01:39:00.910 --> 01:39:00.920 align:start position:0%
uh the new um uh energy code and I mean
 
01:39:02.750 --> 01:39:02.760 align:start position:0%
as I read it a municipality couldn't
 
01:39:03.910 --> 01:39:03.920 align:start position:0%
decide on their own they were going to
 
01:39:07.030 --> 01:39:07.040 align:start position:0%
do that is that correct under because
 
01:39:09.990 --> 01:39:10.000 align:start position:0%
that original legislation is in effect
 
01:39:13.030 --> 01:39:13.040 align:start position:0%
they can't do that okay
 
01:39:16.470 --> 01:39:16.480 align:start position:0%
um they're they're in Edna now in on the
 
01:39:18.229 --> 01:39:18.239 align:start position:0%
Senate side we're hearing that and we've
 
01:39:21.510 --> 01:39:21.520 align:start position:0%
been getting a lot of email concerning
 
01:39:23.870 --> 01:39:23.880 align:start position:0%
um that particular issue and I believe
 
01:39:26.589 --> 01:39:26.599 align:start position:0%
an amendment is going to be presented to
 
01:39:29.030 --> 01:39:29.040 align:start position:0%
US Senate Edna this morning all right
 
01:39:30.870 --> 01:39:30.880 align:start position:0%
well that that's not on this bill but um
 
01:39:32.750 --> 01:39:32.760 align:start position:0%
and and finally one final follow-up
 
01:39:34.109 --> 01:39:34.119 align:start position:0%
follow you're referring to amendment I
 
01:39:36.310 --> 01:39:36.320 align:start position:0%
assume that's the Senate amendment that
 
01:39:38.270 --> 01:39:38.280 align:start position:0%
the Senate adopted okay thank
 
01:39:40.990 --> 01:39:41.000 align:start position:0%
you yes representative Gard thank you
 
01:39:42.589 --> 01:39:42.599 align:start position:0%
chairman just quick question something
 
01:39:44.629 --> 01:39:44.639 align:start position:0%
you said that commercial buildings will
 
01:39:46.750 --> 01:39:46.760 align:start position:0%
cost have cost more to ensure because
 
01:39:48.350 --> 01:39:48.360 align:start position:0%
they weren't built to the current
 
01:39:50.270 --> 01:39:50.280 align:start position:0%
building standards
 
01:39:53.750 --> 01:39:53.760 align:start position:0%
yes so the responsibility is falling on
 
01:39:55.030 --> 01:39:55.040 align:start position:0%
the state for that wouldn't that
 
01:39:58.149 --> 01:39:58.159 align:start position:0%
oversight be to The Architects or the
 
01:39:59.430 --> 01:39:59.440 align:start position:0%
the project managers I'm a little
 
01:40:02.350 --> 01:40:02.360 align:start position:0%
confused okay thank you for the question
 
01:40:04.470 --> 01:40:04.480 align:start position:0%
we have the Statewide building code
 
01:40:07.109 --> 01:40:07.119 align:start position:0%
which sets a standard for how buildings
 
01:40:08.950 --> 01:40:08.960 align:start position:0%
are supposed to be built here in New
 
01:40:12.390 --> 01:40:12.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire there's the the board which is
 
01:40:14.310 --> 01:40:14.320 align:start position:0%
made up of people from all different
 
01:40:16.430 --> 01:40:16.440 align:start position:0%
Industries and they actually go through
 
01:40:19.149 --> 01:40:19.159 align:start position:0%
these things and under the system that
 
01:40:21.950 --> 01:40:21.960 align:start position:0%
representative Maguire and I created
 
01:40:25.550 --> 01:40:25.560 align:start position:0%
they go through them this and they come
 
01:40:28.270 --> 01:40:28.280 align:start position:0%
up with what they want us to do because
 
01:40:31.709 --> 01:40:31.719 align:start position:0%
prior to this we would get a code book
 
01:40:34.149 --> 01:40:34.159 align:start position:0%
was like this thick and there was no way
 
01:40:37.149 --> 01:40:37.159 align:start position:0%
that we could actually go through that
 
01:40:40.270 --> 01:40:40.280 align:start position:0%
so we put the responsibility on them to
 
01:40:44.189 --> 01:40:44.199 align:start position:0%
go through that and to then present um
 
01:40:47.149 --> 01:40:47.159 align:start position:0%
updates to the legislation and
 
01:40:49.750 --> 01:40:49.760 align:start position:0%
representative Maguire and I had thought
 
01:40:52.149 --> 01:40:52.159 align:start position:0%
the best place to start would be in
 
01:40:54.390 --> 01:40:54.400 align:start position:0%
house Edna you have more
 
01:40:57.149 --> 01:40:57.159 align:start position:0%
members um you have subcommittees that
 
01:40:59.990 --> 01:41:00.000 align:start position:0%
could go through this and look at it so
 
01:41:02.109 --> 01:41:02.119 align:start position:0%
by the time we got it in the Senate
 
01:41:03.790 --> 01:41:03.800 align:start position:0%
there might be a few tweaks here and
 
01:41:07.589 --> 01:41:07.599 align:start position:0%
there but really the um the board I mean
 
01:41:09.950 --> 01:41:09.960 align:start position:0%
we listen to the board and what their
 
01:41:11.750 --> 01:41:11.760 align:start position:0%
suggestions are and we debate and
 
01:41:14.430 --> 01:41:14.440 align:start position:0%
discuss what they're proposing did I
 
01:41:17.149 --> 01:41:17.159 align:start position:0%
answer your question I might be wording
 
01:41:18.870 --> 01:41:18.880 align:start position:0%
in correctly I yeah I'm just a little
 
01:41:21.070 --> 01:41:21.080 align:start position:0%
confused that that operates but thank
 
01:41:24.510 --> 01:41:24.520 align:start position:0%
you representative Le us if I could help
 
01:41:26.950 --> 01:41:26.960 align:start position:0%
and this is I'm not sure uh I understand
 
01:41:28.070 --> 01:41:28.080 align:start position:0%
what you're getting at but the question
 
01:41:30.550 --> 01:41:30.560 align:start position:0%
would be um is there anything that would
 
01:41:33.030 --> 01:41:33.040 align:start position:0%
prevent a business that wants the lower
 
01:41:35.629 --> 01:41:35.639 align:start position:0%
Insurance to require that the building
 
01:41:39.070 --> 01:41:39.080 align:start position:0%
be built to some newer or higher
 
01:41:40.790 --> 01:41:40.800 align:start position:0%
building code thank you for the question
 
01:41:42.149 --> 01:41:42.159 align:start position:0%
it's my understanding they could do that
 
01:41:44.950 --> 01:41:44.960 align:start position:0%
on their own the state building CO code
 
01:41:48.030 --> 01:41:48.040 align:start position:0%
is kind of like a skeleton or a floor I
 
01:41:51.629 --> 01:41:51.639 align:start position:0%
mean a municipality can add but all that
 
01:41:54.350 --> 01:41:54.360 align:start position:0%
original legislation just just said look
 
01:41:56.550 --> 01:41:56.560 align:start position:0%
run it through the state uh the building
 
01:41:58.709 --> 01:41:58.719 align:start position:0%
code review board and they're going to
 
01:42:02.830 --> 01:42:02.840 align:start position:0%
take a look at it and then they're they
 
01:42:05.990 --> 01:42:06.000 align:start position:0%
can say whoa whoa whoa you're you're
 
01:42:08.109 --> 01:42:08.119 align:start position:0%
what you're doing doesn't even meet the
 
01:42:10.709 --> 01:42:10.719 align:start position:0%
floor and ask them to go back and take a
 
01:42:13.229 --> 01:42:13.239 align:start position:0%
look at it but if a municipality wants
 
01:42:15.910 --> 01:42:15.920 align:start position:0%
to go beyond that all that legislation
 
01:42:18.669 --> 01:42:18.679 align:start position:0%
said was we're going to look at it and
 
01:42:20.430 --> 01:42:20.440 align:start position:0%
then we're going to send it back to you
 
01:42:22.870 --> 01:42:22.880 align:start position:0%
and it was to really assist the fire
 
01:42:22.880 --> 01:42:23.870 align:start position:0%
and it was to really assist the fire
mark

01:42:23.870 --> 01:42:23.880 align:start position:0%
mark
 
01:42:25.589 --> 01:42:25.599 align:start position:0%
in putting together these codes that
 
01:42:29.870 --> 01:42:29.880 align:start position:0%
there be one place where anyone can go
 
01:42:34.430 --> 01:42:34.440 align:start position:0%
any contractor developer to know in this
 
01:42:36.430 --> 01:42:36.440 align:start position:0%
particular town this is what you have to
 
01:42:40.470 --> 01:42:40.480 align:start position:0%
do because part of the problem was the
 
01:42:42.189 --> 01:42:42.199 align:start position:0%
state there were so many different
 
01:42:44.270 --> 01:42:44.280 align:start position:0%
places in the state that were doing
 
01:42:47.229 --> 01:42:47.239 align:start position:0%
different things and developers
 
01:42:49.550 --> 01:42:49.560 align:start position:0%
contractors it took them a long time to
 
01:42:52.070 --> 01:42:52.080 align:start position:0%
be able to gather that information to
 
01:42:54.589 --> 01:42:54.599 align:start position:0%
know well in I'm just going to use the
 
01:42:57.189 --> 01:42:57.199 align:start position:0%
town of Epsom they have to do things
 
01:42:59.790 --> 01:42:59.800 align:start position:0%
this way rather than the town of
 
01:43:02.270 --> 01:43:02.280 align:start position:0%
londondary requires something
 
01:43:04.669 --> 01:43:04.679 align:start position:0%
different so it's about it's about
 
01:43:06.189 --> 01:43:06.199 align:start position:0%
conveying that
 
01:43:08.790 --> 01:43:08.800 align:start position:0%
information thank
 
01:43:10.990 --> 01:43:11.000 align:start position:0%
you any other questions yes
 
01:43:13.790 --> 01:43:13.800 align:start position:0%
representative Gera you thank you um Mr
 
01:43:16.310 --> 01:43:16.320 align:start position:0%
chair Senator Carson I just want some
 
01:43:18.950 --> 01:43:18.960 align:start position:0%
clarification so what you had said was
 
01:43:21.350 --> 01:43:21.360 align:start position:0%
there was that any municipality who had
 
01:43:24.310 --> 01:43:24.320 align:start position:0%
taken advantage of that window mhm we
 
01:43:26.910 --> 01:43:26.920 align:start position:0%
need to re would need to submit their
 
01:43:29.709 --> 01:43:29.719 align:start position:0%
ordinances yeah the changes and it says
 
01:43:32.550 --> 01:43:32.560 align:start position:0%
that any ordinance shall be submitted to
 
01:43:34.709 --> 01:43:34.719 align:start position:0%
the State Building co-w I'm on page
 
01:43:39.830 --> 01:43:39.840 align:start position:0%
three line 18 and 19 for review and
 
01:43:43.390 --> 01:43:43.400 align:start position:0%
Confirmation is is that terminology sign
 
01:43:45.109 --> 01:43:45.119 align:start position:0%
does that mean something to what does
 
01:43:47.430 --> 01:43:47.440 align:start position:0%
that mean by well review but
 
01:43:47.440 --> 01:43:49.589 align:start position:0%
that mean by well review but
confirmation

01:43:49.589 --> 01:43:49.599 align:start position:0%
confirmation
 
01:43:53.310 --> 01:43:53.320 align:start position:0%
confirmation I'm I'm just trying to okay
 
01:43:56.030 --> 01:43:56.040 align:start position:0%
figure out what the consequences will be
 
01:43:57.229 --> 01:43:57.239 align:start position:0%
for those
 
01:44:00.790 --> 01:44:00.800 align:start position:0%
municipalities who have used that
 
01:44:04.189 --> 01:44:04.199 align:start position:0%
window and then they're they do submit
 
01:44:06.229 --> 01:44:06.239 align:start position:0%
the information to the building code
 
01:44:06.239 --> 01:44:07.109 align:start position:0%
the information to the building code
review

01:44:07.109 --> 01:44:07.119 align:start position:0%
review
 
01:44:10.390 --> 01:44:10.400 align:start position:0%
board and then if the building I'm just
 
01:44:12.229 --> 01:44:12.239 align:start position:0%
trying to find out what the consequences
 
01:44:14.229 --> 01:44:14.239 align:start position:0%
will be for that community that the
 
01:44:15.870 --> 01:44:15.880 align:start position:0%
municipality who took advantage of that
 
01:44:18.910 --> 01:44:18.920 align:start position:0%
time thank you for that question um I
 
01:44:21.310 --> 01:44:21.320 align:start position:0%
have not reviewed the original bill I
 
01:44:24.270 --> 01:44:24.280 align:start position:0%
haven't gone back but um Mr Sherman is
 
01:44:26.149 --> 01:44:26.159 align:start position:0%
here from the building code review board
 
01:44:28.790 --> 01:44:28.800 align:start position:0%
and I think he could answer that um I
 
01:44:32.470 --> 01:44:32.480 align:start position:0%
don't believe I put penalties in here um
 
01:44:34.229 --> 01:44:34.239 align:start position:0%
it's just we're just saying
 
01:44:37.470 --> 01:44:37.480 align:start position:0%
look send take those send them to the
 
01:44:39.109 --> 01:44:39.119 align:start position:0%
building code review board and have them
 
01:44:42.270 --> 01:44:42.280 align:start position:0%
take a look at it that's all thank you
 
01:44:43.830 --> 01:44:43.840 align:start position:0%
so much thank
 
01:44:47.189 --> 01:44:47.199 align:start position:0%
you further
 
01:44:49.030 --> 01:44:49.040 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you very
 
01:44:51.669 --> 01:44:51.679 align:start position:0%
much Senator thank you very much Mr
 
01:44:54.390 --> 01:44:54.400 align:start position:0%
chairman William mckenny New Hampshire
 
01:45:05.870 --> 01:45:05.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:08.589 --> 01:45:08.599 align:start position:0%
you yes good morning Mr chairman members
 
01:45:09.870 --> 01:45:09.880 align:start position:0%
of the committee my name is William
 
01:45:10.990 --> 01:45:11.000 align:start position:0%
mckenny I'm the president of the New
 
01:45:13.109 --> 01:45:13.119 align:start position:0%
Hampshire building officials Association
 
01:45:15.390 --> 01:45:15.400 align:start position:0%
we represent roughly 200 uh code
 
01:45:16.990 --> 01:45:17.000 align:start position:0%
officials throughout the state we also
 
01:45:19.350 --> 01:45:19.360 align:start position:0%
have membership from licens design
 
01:45:21.030 --> 01:45:21.040 align:start position:0%
professionals such as Architects
 
01:45:23.709 --> 01:45:23.719 align:start position:0%
engineers and as well as um contractors
 
01:45:25.350 --> 01:45:25.360 align:start position:0%
around the state would you mind speaking
 
01:45:27.030 --> 01:45:27.040 align:start position:0%
just a little bit closer to the mic I
 
01:45:29.070 --> 01:45:29.080 align:start position:0%
can certainly do that thank you is that
 
01:45:31.229 --> 01:45:31.239 align:start position:0%
better thank
 
01:45:35.669 --> 01:45:35.679 align:start position:0%
you so Senate Bill 437 helps to clarify
 
01:45:38.189 --> 01:45:38.199 align:start position:0%
and limit uh The Authority for local
 
01:45:40.229 --> 01:45:40.239 align:start position:0%
communities to amend the State Building
 
01:45:43.070 --> 01:45:43.080 align:start position:0%
Code and for that purpose nhpa supports
 
01:45:47.109 --> 01:45:47.119 align:start position:0%
the bill um this helps to move um away
 
01:45:50.950 --> 01:45:50.960 align:start position:0%
from uh when communities start to adopt
 
01:45:53.830 --> 01:45:53.840 align:start position:0%
entire codes and really start to amend
 
01:45:55.870 --> 01:45:55.880 align:start position:0%
the State Building Code it moves us away
 
01:45:58.350 --> 01:45:58.360 align:start position:0%
from the intent the original intent of
 
01:46:01.510 --> 01:46:01.520 align:start position:0%
155a RSA 155a which is the Statewide
 
01:46:03.270 --> 01:46:03.280 align:start position:0%
building code and we start to end up
 
01:46:05.229 --> 01:46:05.239 align:start position:0%
with pockets and islands of different
 
01:46:07.470 --> 01:46:07.480 align:start position:0%
codes and if you recall prior to the
 
01:46:09.070 --> 01:46:09.080 align:start position:0%
Statewide building code being adopted
 
01:46:10.470 --> 01:46:10.480 align:start position:0%
that was the biggest concern from
 
01:46:13.070 --> 01:46:13.080 align:start position:0%
developers was that you didn't know what
 
01:46:15.310 --> 01:46:15.320 align:start position:0%
code you were working under depending
 
01:46:17.790 --> 01:46:17.800 align:start position:0%
upon what community you were building in
 
01:46:21.750 --> 01:46:21.760 align:start position:0%
and so RSA 155a was adopted to address
 
01:46:25.229 --> 01:46:25.239 align:start position:0%
that issue in the state of mixed codes
 
01:46:26.870 --> 01:46:26.880 align:start position:0%
all around so we should have one
 
01:46:29.149 --> 01:46:29.159 align:start position:0%
Statewide building code it still
 
01:46:31.470 --> 01:46:31.480 align:start position:0%
preserves the right for the communities
 
01:46:33.870 --> 01:46:33.880 align:start position:0%
to adopt more stringent Provisions which
 
01:46:35.910 --> 01:46:35.920 align:start position:0%
means as a code official you would need
 
01:46:38.589 --> 01:46:38.599 align:start position:0%
to look at the code specifically dra
 
01:46:40.350 --> 01:46:40.360 align:start position:0%
look at the section that you have a
 
01:46:42.470 --> 01:46:42.480 align:start position:0%
concern with and propose an amendment to
 
01:46:43.990 --> 01:46:44.000 align:start position:0%
that that may be more stringent than the
 
01:46:45.910 --> 01:46:45.920 align:start position:0%
building code and then that would have
 
01:46:47.430 --> 01:46:47.440 align:start position:0%
to be reviewed by the building code
 
01:46:49.430 --> 01:46:49.440 align:start position:0%
review board this is a process that's
 
01:46:52.629 --> 01:46:52.639 align:start position:0%
been adopted for several years now um
 
01:46:54.950 --> 01:46:54.960 align:start position:0%
that were a few communities that um did
 
01:46:58.070 --> 01:46:58.080 align:start position:0%
find a way that they could um put their
 
01:47:00.589 --> 01:47:00.599 align:start position:0%
code amendments through um before uh an
 
01:47:03.629 --> 01:47:03.639 align:start position:0%
effective date of the last legislation
 
01:47:06.310 --> 01:47:06.320 align:start position:0%
and for that we support what is being
 
01:47:09.709 --> 01:47:09.719 align:start position:0%
proposed here in s SB
 
01:47:14.189 --> 01:47:14.199 align:start position:0%
437 we do have concerns however with um
 
01:47:18.109 --> 01:47:18.119 align:start position:0%
page two from lines 28 through 37 and
 
01:47:22.669 --> 01:47:22.679 align:start position:0%
page three lines 1 through 8 um as far
 
01:47:26.550 --> 01:47:26.560 align:start position:0%
as is the
 
01:47:26.560 --> 01:47:28.390 align:start position:0%
as is the
um

01:47:28.390 --> 01:47:28.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:47:31.510 --> 01:47:31.520 align:start position:0%
retroactive um effectiveness of some of
 
01:47:33.669 --> 01:47:33.679 align:start position:0%
the provisions there such as if you have
 
01:47:36.310 --> 01:47:36.320 align:start position:0%
adopted legal even through the legal
 
01:47:39.629 --> 01:47:39.639 align:start position:0%
process have adopted that those um
 
01:47:41.550 --> 01:47:41.560 align:start position:0%
amendments may basically become
 
01:47:44.390 --> 01:47:44.400 align:start position:0%
ineffective it's a concern I I wouldn't
 
01:47:46.990 --> 01:47:47.000 align:start position:0%
say it should be a deal breaker but it's
 
01:47:48.430 --> 01:47:48.440 align:start position:0%
something that I think we should look at
 
01:47:50.990 --> 01:47:51.000 align:start position:0%
and legally um make sure that you know
 
01:47:52.830 --> 01:47:52.840 align:start position:0%
no Community can come through and file
 
01:47:56.510 --> 01:47:56.520 align:start position:0%
suit against that so um with that uh I
 
01:47:59.750 --> 01:47:59.760 align:start position:0%
would say that I would ask support um
 
01:48:01.950 --> 01:48:01.960 align:start position:0%
from this committee for Senate Bill four
 
01:48:04.750 --> 01:48:04.760 align:start position:0%
uh 437 and help close up some of the
 
01:48:07.470 --> 01:48:07.480 align:start position:0%
loopholes that we currently have in our
 
01:48:07.480 --> 01:48:08.270 align:start position:0%
loopholes that we currently have in our
uh

01:48:08.270 --> 01:48:08.280 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:48:10.109 --> 01:48:10.119 align:start position:0%
process with that I'll take any
 
01:48:11.910 --> 01:48:11.920 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much are there
 
01:48:13.709 --> 01:48:13.719 align:start position:0%
any questions yes representative
 
01:48:15.910 --> 01:48:15.920 align:start position:0%
Fitzpatrick I'm going to follow up on
 
01:48:18.990 --> 01:48:19.000 align:start position:0%
what representative groa was uh brought
 
01:48:23.750 --> 01:48:23.760 align:start position:0%
up with the previous uh speaker
 
01:48:29.310 --> 01:48:29.320 align:start position:0%
on page three lines four and five upon
 
01:48:31.390 --> 01:48:31.400 align:start position:0%
withholding of confirmation of a
 
01:48:33.510 --> 01:48:33.520 align:start position:0%
submitted local amendment by the State
 
01:48:36.470 --> 01:48:36.480 align:start position:0%
Fire Marshall local amendments shall not
 
01:48:36.480 --> 01:48:37.669 align:start position:0%
Fire Marshall local amendments shall not
be

01:48:37.669 --> 01:48:37.679 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:48:40.950 --> 01:48:40.960 align:start position:0%
enforced what does that mean that would
 
01:48:43.030 --> 01:48:43.040 align:start position:0%
be the specific language that you know
 
01:48:45.189 --> 01:48:45.199 align:start position:0%
members of our association are concerned
 
01:48:47.550 --> 01:48:47.560 align:start position:0%
with um that that also shows up under
 
01:48:50.709 --> 01:48:50.719 align:start position:0%
the building code um uh piece of it as
 
01:48:53.830 --> 01:48:53.840 align:start position:0%
well um so what that would say is that
 
01:48:56.750 --> 01:48:56.760 align:start position:0%
um any any if for some reason the
 
01:48:58.470 --> 01:48:58.480 align:start position:0%
building code review board finds that
 
01:49:00.109 --> 01:49:00.119 align:start position:0%
anything that was adopted even if it's
 
01:49:03.229 --> 01:49:03.239 align:start position:0%
through the legal process um doesn't
 
01:49:06.870 --> 01:49:06.880 align:start position:0%
comply with this RSA then you could no
 
01:49:08.950 --> 01:49:08.960 align:start position:0%
longer enforce that and I think that's
 
01:49:12.470 --> 01:49:12.480 align:start position:0%
opens the door to a legal battle that I
 
01:49:14.950 --> 01:49:14.960 align:start position:0%
I I don't have enough knowledge about
 
01:49:18.510 --> 01:49:18.520 align:start position:0%
followup followup because enforced by
 
01:49:21.589 --> 01:49:21.599 align:start position:0%
who by State Fire Marshal by the local
 
01:49:23.270 --> 01:49:23.280 align:start position:0%
building codes
 
01:49:24.830 --> 01:49:24.840 align:start position:0%
it it would not be enforceable by the
 
01:49:24.840 --> 01:49:26.350 align:start position:0%
it it would not be enforceable by the
local

01:49:26.350 --> 01:49:26.360 align:start position:0%
local
 
01:49:29.189 --> 01:49:29.199 align:start position:0%
community further followup and and would
 
01:49:33.270 --> 01:49:33.280 align:start position:0%
probably also lead to uh AUD
 
01:49:38.270 --> 01:49:38.280 align:start position:0%
adjud adjudication uh by uh developers
 
01:49:40.629 --> 01:49:40.639 align:start position:0%
and and it could just be a mess it seems
 
01:49:44.510 --> 01:49:44.520 align:start position:0%
to me again that that particular section
 
01:49:47.149 --> 01:49:47.159 align:start position:0%
of this does cause us some concern the
 
01:49:50.669 --> 01:49:50.679 align:start position:0%
rest of the bill is well
 
01:49:53.510 --> 01:49:53.520 align:start position:0%
crafted thank you you're welcome
 
01:49:53.520 --> 01:49:54.589 align:start position:0%
crafted thank you you're welcome
representative

01:49:54.589 --> 01:49:54.599 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:49:57.430 --> 01:49:57.440 align:start position:0%
Schmidt thank you Mr chairman so was
 
01:50:00.189 --> 01:50:00.199 align:start position:0%
this issue already raised in the
 
01:50:03.270 --> 01:50:03.280 align:start position:0%
senate representative F Patrick's
 
01:50:06.430 --> 01:50:06.440 align:start position:0%
question yes sir it was it was uh raised
 
01:50:08.270 --> 01:50:08.280 align:start position:0%
in the in the one of the hearings at the
 
01:50:11.870 --> 01:50:11.880 align:start position:0%
Senate and and again it's here I can't
 
01:50:15.109 --> 01:50:15.119 align:start position:0%
speak to the to the legal
 
01:50:17.910 --> 01:50:17.920 align:start position:0%
um results of that but I I would say
 
01:50:19.229 --> 01:50:19.239 align:start position:0%
that you know some of those communities
 
01:50:22.109 --> 01:50:22.119 align:start position:0%
that have adopted through the process
 
01:50:23.189 --> 01:50:23.199 align:start position:0%
that was
 
01:50:28.030 --> 01:50:28.040 align:start position:0%
available to them may question the um
 
01:50:30.830 --> 01:50:30.840 align:start position:0%
being able to have retroactive action so
 
01:50:35.270 --> 01:50:35.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:39.229 --> 01:50:39.239 align:start position:0%
subcommittee I'm I'm sorry I I'm sorry
 
01:50:42.270 --> 01:50:42.280 align:start position:0%
I'm late the Senate was working on I
 
01:50:45.950 --> 01:50:45.960 align:start position:0%
just barely got out of the Senate uh if
 
01:50:48.069 --> 01:50:48.079 align:start position:0%
it's do you think it should go to sub
 
01:50:48.079 --> 01:50:49.149 align:start position:0%
it's do you think it should go to sub
commmittee

01:50:49.149 --> 01:50:49.159 align:start position:0%
commmittee
 
01:50:51.149 --> 01:50:51.159 align:start position:0%
um maybe we should hear from everybody
 
01:50:52.510 --> 01:50:52.520 align:start position:0%
else first to see if it gets cleared up
 
01:50:54.990 --> 01:50:55.000 align:start position:0%
by but yes but I know that Mr McKinley
 
01:50:56.589 --> 01:50:56.599 align:start position:0%
will work with the subcommittee if there
 
01:51:00.790 --> 01:51:00.800 align:start position:0%
is one I mean I I if this isue has
 
01:51:03.390 --> 01:51:03.400 align:start position:0%
already been raised a senate has made a
 
01:51:05.790 --> 01:51:05.800 align:start position:0%
decision uh then we certainly have to
 
01:51:08.669 --> 01:51:08.679 align:start position:0%
look at whether we think this is a
 
01:51:11.390 --> 01:51:11.400 align:start position:0%
workable situation or a good solution or
 
01:51:15.109 --> 01:51:15.119 align:start position:0%
whatever and I chairman Sherman is
 
01:51:17.390 --> 01:51:17.400 align:start position:0%
probably going to testify on this is he
 
01:51:19.310 --> 01:51:19.320 align:start position:0%
got a carded he does yeah that's what
 
01:51:21.189 --> 01:51:21.199 align:start position:0%
I'm saying maybe we just exp we hear
 
01:51:22.270 --> 01:51:22.280 align:start position:0%
everybody out and then we'll make a call
 
01:51:24.310 --> 01:51:24.320 align:start position:0%
from there exactly thank you Mr
 
01:51:27.189 --> 01:51:27.199 align:start position:0%
chairman yes representative Mani thank
 
01:51:29.910 --> 01:51:29.920 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair uh thank you for taking my
 
01:51:33.629 --> 01:51:33.639 align:start position:0%
question isn't this totally opposite of
 
01:51:35.550 --> 01:51:35.560 align:start position:0%
uh what New Hampshire does usually the
 
01:51:40.870 --> 01:51:40.880 align:start position:0%
local control is very um top priority
 
01:51:44.030 --> 01:51:44.040 align:start position:0%
and so in this particular instance the
 
01:51:48.350 --> 01:51:48.360 align:start position:0%
take local control is taken away and
 
01:51:53.350 --> 01:51:53.360 align:start position:0%
state controls it so is that normal or
 
01:51:55.350 --> 01:51:55.360 align:start position:0%
not thank you that's a very good
 
01:51:57.030 --> 01:51:57.040 align:start position:0%
question uh I don't believe local
 
01:51:59.149 --> 01:51:59.159 align:start position:0%
control is being taken away at this I
 
01:52:02.069 --> 01:52:02.079 align:start position:0%
believe it is limiting what the locals
 
01:52:04.870 --> 01:52:04.880 align:start position:0%
local communities can do to you know
 
01:52:07.750 --> 01:52:07.760 align:start position:0%
massage the State Building Code um RSA
 
01:52:11.629 --> 01:52:11.639 align:start position:0%
155 a when it was adopted and I believe
 
01:52:13.510 --> 01:52:13.520 align:start position:0%
was early
 
01:52:16.750 --> 01:52:16.760 align:start position:0%
2000s had the limit in that that the
 
01:52:19.270 --> 01:52:19.280 align:start position:0%
communities could adopt more stringent
 
01:52:22.229 --> 01:52:22.239 align:start position:0%
provisions of the State Building Code or
 
01:52:25.030 --> 01:52:25.040 align:start position:0%
or adopted codes it never had the intent
 
01:52:26.629 --> 01:52:26.639 align:start position:0%
or never had the language in it that you
 
01:52:28.430 --> 01:52:28.440 align:start position:0%
could adopt an entire
 
01:52:31.229 --> 01:52:31.239 align:start position:0%
code um communities have gone through
 
01:52:33.990 --> 01:52:34.000 align:start position:0%
and adopted entire codes and then put in
 
01:52:36.030 --> 01:52:36.040 align:start position:0%
the provisions there in Provisions in
 
01:52:37.910 --> 01:52:37.920 align:start position:0%
their ordinance that says oh unless the
 
01:52:39.430 --> 01:52:39.440 align:start position:0%
state building code is more restrictive
 
01:52:40.390 --> 01:52:40.400 align:start position:0%
than you have to follow the State
 
01:52:42.950 --> 01:52:42.960 align:start position:0%
Building Code knowing that there may be
 
01:52:44.310 --> 01:52:44.320 align:start position:0%
Provisions in the code that they've
 
01:52:46.229 --> 01:52:46.239 align:start position:0%
adopted that are less stringent than the
 
01:52:48.550 --> 01:52:48.560 align:start position:0%
state code so what this does is prevents
 
01:52:51.510 --> 01:52:51.520 align:start position:0%
communities from adopting an entire book
 
01:52:53.069 --> 01:52:53.079 align:start position:0%
of code
 
01:52:54.950 --> 01:52:54.960 align:start position:0%
without going through the process of
 
01:52:56.350 --> 01:52:56.360 align:start position:0%
vetting that code to make sure that
 
01:52:57.990 --> 01:52:58.000 align:start position:0%
there's nothing in there that's less
 
01:53:00.270 --> 01:53:00.280 align:start position:0%
stringent than the state
 
01:53:04.310 --> 01:53:04.320 align:start position:0%
code followup a followup so you're just
 
01:53:08.629 --> 01:53:08.639 align:start position:0%
confirming my confusion as to if it is
 
01:53:12.149 --> 01:53:12.159 align:start position:0%
Le if the local communities adopt a less
 
01:53:15.870 --> 01:53:15.880 align:start position:0%
strting stringent code than State that's
 
01:53:19.109 --> 01:53:19.119 align:start position:0%
not allowed but if they are local
 
01:53:22.870 --> 01:53:22.880 align:start position:0%
communities are adopting more stringent
 
01:53:26.069 --> 01:53:26.079 align:start position:0%
than the state it is
 
01:53:28.790 --> 01:53:28.800 align:start position:0%
okay again I believe this bill brings it
 
01:53:32.189 --> 01:53:32.199 align:start position:0%
brings back RSA 15's original intent is
 
01:53:34.069 --> 01:53:34.079 align:start position:0%
that you would need to adopt line by
 
01:53:35.750 --> 01:53:35.760 align:start position:0%
line provisions of the code that you
 
01:53:41.109 --> 01:53:41.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:44.350 --> 01:53:44.360 align:start position:0%
stringent representative Brown uh thank
 
01:53:45.870 --> 01:53:45.880 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair thanks for taking my
 
01:53:47.790 --> 01:53:47.800 align:start position:0%
question so going going back a little
 
01:53:49.709 --> 01:53:49.719 align:start position:0%
bit to where you were on page two line
 
01:53:54.870 --> 01:53:54.880 align:start position:0%
26 to 37 or let's say line 26
 
01:53:58.990 --> 01:53:59.000 align:start position:0%
to35 the the first part on line 26 27
 
01:54:01.750 --> 01:54:01.760 align:start position:0%
28 so now I understand what I didn't
 
01:54:03.149 --> 01:54:03.159 align:start position:0%
understand the times I've read this at
 
01:54:06.510 --> 01:54:06.520 align:start position:0%
home I believe that that prior to July
 
01:54:09.750 --> 01:54:09.760 align:start position:0%
2024 n RSA 155 is that Gap that the
 
01:54:12.589 --> 01:54:12.599 align:start position:0%
senator was speaking of correct yes sir
 
01:54:15.510 --> 01:54:15.520 align:start position:0%
thank you and then going down to line 33
 
01:54:18.310 --> 01:54:18.320 align:start position:0%
to 35 it has that same language that uh
 
01:54:19.910 --> 01:54:19.920 align:start position:0%
representative Fitzpatrick mentioned on
 
01:54:23.790 --> 01:54:23.800 align:start position:0%
the next page line 30 3 to 35 is for the
 
01:54:26.310 --> 01:54:26.320 align:start position:0%
building code changes whereas on page
 
01:54:30.830 --> 01:54:30.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:33.550 --> 01:54:33.560 align:start position:0%
code is that correct that is correct sir
 
01:54:34.709 --> 01:54:34.719 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:54:37.830 --> 01:54:37.840 align:start position:0%
and would it make sense that when it
 
01:54:39.629 --> 01:54:39.639 align:start position:0%
says shall not be enforced that would
 
01:54:41.709 --> 01:54:41.719 align:start position:0%
not follow the normal enforcement
 
01:54:46.550 --> 01:54:46.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:50.109 --> 01:54:50.119 align:start position:0%
body again there are at least two
 
01:54:51.870 --> 01:54:51.880 align:start position:0%
communities I believe that follow the
 
01:54:54.229 --> 01:54:54.239 align:start position:0%
legal process that was in effect at the
 
01:54:56.629 --> 01:54:56.639 align:start position:0%
time and the question would be and and
 
01:54:58.870 --> 01:54:58.880 align:start position:0%
maybe it just needs clarification from
 
01:55:00.350 --> 01:55:00.360 align:start position:0%
you know the legal experts here in
 
01:55:03.510 --> 01:55:03.520 align:start position:0%
conquered of whether
 
01:55:05.629 --> 01:55:05.639 align:start position:0%
retroactively not allowing them to
 
01:55:08.589 --> 01:55:08.599 align:start position:0%
enforce that if they had adopted that
 
01:55:10.430 --> 01:55:10.440 align:start position:0%
prior to July 1
 
01:55:13.709 --> 01:55:13.719 align:start position:0%
2024 um if that's legal or not and that
 
01:55:16.109 --> 01:55:16.119 align:start position:0%
is our only concern and I believe it it
 
01:55:18.589 --> 01:55:18.599 align:start position:0%
affects truthfully two communities in
 
01:55:20.510 --> 01:55:20.520 align:start position:0%
the state okay thank
 
01:55:23.310 --> 01:55:23.320 align:start position:0%
you any further questions
 
01:55:24.470 --> 01:55:24.480 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
01:55:26.510 --> 01:55:26.520 align:start position:0%
goalie thank you Mr chair do we know
 
01:55:28.189 --> 01:55:28.199 align:start position:0%
what those two communities
 
01:55:30.149 --> 01:55:30.159 align:start position:0%
are excuse
 
01:55:33.589 --> 01:55:33.599 align:start position:0%
me Durham what are the two communities
 
01:55:34.950 --> 01:55:34.960 align:start position:0%
the two communities that would be of
 
01:55:39.870 --> 01:55:39.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:42.589 --> 01:55:42.599 align:start position:0%
Portsmith see excuse me
 
01:55:45.310 --> 01:55:45.320 align:start position:0%
represent Mr Greenland if you could get
 
01:55:50.950 --> 01:55:50.960 align:start position:0%
with our legal team and find out what is
 
01:55:52.870 --> 01:55:52.880 align:start position:0%
with that issue
 
01:55:52.880 --> 01:55:55.149 align:start position:0%
with that issue
thank

01:55:55.149 --> 01:55:55.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:57.310 --> 01:55:57.320 align:start position:0%

representative gard's uh question about
 
01:56:04.790 --> 01:56:04.800 align:start position:0%
insurance and insurance ratings that he
 
01:56:07.790 --> 01:56:07.800 align:start position:0%
asked um Senator
 
01:56:10.510 --> 01:56:10.520 align:start position:0%
Carson um maybe if you could do it
 
01:56:12.069 --> 01:56:12.079 align:start position:0%
afterwards with him individually that
 
01:56:13.629 --> 01:56:13.639 align:start position:0%
that would probably be better absolutely
 
01:56:17.830 --> 01:56:17.840 align:start position:0%

Industrial uh contractors subcontractors

and suppliers I'm here today today in
 
01:56:54.990 --> 01:56:55.000 align:start position:0%
support of Senate Bill
 
01:56:58.669 --> 01:56:58.679 align:start position:0%
437 I was here years before when we
 
01:57:00.750 --> 01:57:00.760 align:start position:0%
supported the original legislation that
 
01:57:02.910 --> 01:57:02.920 align:start position:0%
talked about filing
 
01:57:05.550 --> 01:57:05.560 align:start position:0%
amendments there really is two major
 
01:57:08.950 --> 01:57:08.960 align:start position:0%
benefits for my industry with this bill
 
01:57:09.910 --> 01:57:09.920 align:start position:0%
and the
 
01:57:13.109 --> 01:57:13.119 align:start position:0%
clarification what this bill is just Rec
 
01:57:16.189 --> 01:57:16.199 align:start position:0%
clarifying uh that when municipalities
 
01:57:18.790 --> 01:57:18.800 align:start position:0%
make amendments to the code it gets
 
01:57:20.709 --> 01:57:20.719 align:start position:0%
filed with the building code review
 
01:57:23.030 --> 01:57:23.040 align:start position:0%
board they revie view it to make sure
 
01:57:25.470 --> 01:57:25.480 align:start position:0%
it's not in Conflict which is great for
 
01:57:28.629 --> 01:57:28.639 align:start position:0%
us that it gets filed and therefore is
 
01:57:31.350 --> 01:57:31.360 align:start position:0%
an easy resource for the industry to go
 
01:57:33.750 --> 01:57:33.760 align:start position:0%
there and look at what the differences
 
01:57:36.310 --> 01:57:36.320 align:start position:0%
are with specific cities and towns now
 
01:57:39.470 --> 01:57:39.480 align:start position:0%
when the first legislation drafted
 
01:57:42.350 --> 01:57:42.360 align:start position:0%
this there becomes some unclarity of how
 
01:57:45.629 --> 01:57:45.639 align:start position:0%
this would work in totality and many
 
01:57:48.109 --> 01:57:48.119 align:start position:0%
communities didn't file so the resource
 
01:57:50.990 --> 01:57:51.000 align:start position:0%
right now for us is not totally there
 
01:57:53.430 --> 01:57:53.440 align:start position:0%
not all the community are particip
 
01:57:55.669 --> 01:57:55.679 align:start position:0%
participating in filing their
 
01:57:58.430 --> 01:57:58.440 align:start position:0%
amendments now I will tell you the the
 
01:58:01.030 --> 01:58:01.040 align:start position:0%
other issue for us is I'm still
 
01:58:03.149 --> 01:58:03.159 align:start position:0%
mystified I was around back when we
 
01:58:05.510 --> 01:58:05.520 align:start position:0%
adopted the Statewide building codes so
 
01:58:07.229 --> 01:58:07.239 align:start position:0%
we went from towns having their own
 
01:58:09.870 --> 01:58:09.880 align:start position:0%
building codes to the state and the
 
01:58:11.550 --> 01:58:11.560 align:start position:0%
reason for that is most towns were
 
01:58:14.709 --> 01:58:14.719 align:start position:0%
behind in the code and the industry and
 
01:58:17.709 --> 01:58:17.719 align:start position:0%
others were saying we can't be 10 years
 
01:58:20.870 --> 01:58:20.880 align:start position:0%
back in a code so the codes got moved up
 
01:58:22.750 --> 01:58:22.760 align:start position:0%
today it's I find it very interesting
 
01:58:24.990 --> 01:58:25.000 align:start position:0%
that we're talking about towns who go
 
01:58:28.470 --> 01:58:28.480 align:start position:0%
beyond uh the code when in fact like
 
01:58:30.709 --> 01:58:30.719 align:start position:0%
right now we're about to adopt the 21
 
01:58:32.470 --> 01:58:32.480 align:start position:0%
code so the Amendments that have been
 
01:58:36.189 --> 01:58:36.199 align:start position:0%
filed are against the 2018 code well
 
01:58:37.550 --> 01:58:37.560 align:start position:0%
guess what those amendments aren't going
 
01:58:40.030 --> 01:58:40.040 align:start position:0%
to work for town when we adopt the 21
 
01:58:42.629 --> 01:58:42.639 align:start position:0%
code if they amended the 18 because the
 
01:58:45.109 --> 01:58:45.119 align:start position:0%
21 language is going to be different so
 
01:58:46.589 --> 01:58:46.599 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of work for cities and
 
01:58:48.870 --> 01:58:48.880 align:start position:0%
towns to do to make sure their
 
01:58:51.550 --> 01:58:51.560 align:start position:0%
amendments match and I think this bill
 
01:58:53.990 --> 01:58:54.000 align:start position:0%
tries to clarify some of that because
 
01:58:55.870 --> 01:58:55.880 align:start position:0%
some of those amendments may not make
 
01:58:57.589 --> 01:58:57.599 align:start position:0%
sense anymore because they don't match
 
01:59:00.270 --> 01:59:00.280 align:start position:0%
up with the new 21 code that we're
 
01:59:02.629 --> 01:59:02.639 align:start position:0%
adopting so I I want to put that on the
 
01:59:05.149 --> 01:59:05.159 align:start position:0%
table I really towns are putting
 
01:59:06.390 --> 01:59:06.400 align:start position:0%
themselves through a lot of work to
 
01:59:08.910 --> 01:59:08.920 align:start position:0%
amend a code that with are being one
 
01:59:11.189 --> 01:59:11.199 align:start position:0%
cycle back doesn't make a lot of sense
 
01:59:14.350 --> 01:59:14.360 align:start position:0%
to me but if a town does it this bill
 
01:59:16.669 --> 01:59:16.679 align:start position:0%
kind of outlines that process that they
 
01:59:19.550 --> 01:59:19.560 align:start position:0%
go to the building code review board and
 
01:59:21.430 --> 01:59:21.440 align:start position:0%
here comes the second most important for
 
01:59:21.440 --> 01:59:23.149 align:start position:0%
here comes the second most important for
us

01:59:23.149 --> 01:59:23.159 align:start position:0%
us
 
01:59:25.790 --> 01:59:25.800 align:start position:0%
we wanted to reduce the number of future
 
01:59:28.950 --> 01:59:28.960 align:start position:0%
Municipal Code conflicts that's where we
 
01:59:31.270 --> 01:59:31.280 align:start position:0%
get into trouble we try to build a
 
01:59:33.629 --> 01:59:33.639 align:start position:0%
building and you have a municipal code
 
01:59:35.189 --> 01:59:35.199 align:start position:0%
that's different than the State Building
 
01:59:38.510 --> 01:59:38.520 align:start position:0%
Code and we end up in a a mess trying to
 
01:59:40.830 --> 01:59:40.840 align:start position:0%
build a project so that's the second
 
01:59:43.149 --> 01:59:43.159 align:start position:0%
reason we really like this bill is it
 
01:59:46.229 --> 01:59:46.239 align:start position:0%
tries to do that we're getting on track
 
01:59:48.629 --> 01:59:48.639 align:start position:0%
the chairman and others and Senator
 
01:59:50.589 --> 01:59:50.599 align:start position:0%
Carson over the years have done a great
 
01:59:53.270 --> 01:59:53.280 align:start position:0%
job of getting this building code in the
 
01:59:55.709 --> 01:59:55.719 align:start position:0%
adoption of amendments the adoption of
 
01:59:58.870 --> 01:59:58.880 align:start position:0%
the code being one year behind I think
 
02:00:01.709 --> 02:00:01.719 align:start position:0%
this puts structure to those local
 
02:00:04.109 --> 02:00:04.119 align:start position:0%
amendments to be filed and again we're
 
02:00:07.310 --> 02:00:07.320 align:start position:0%
not saying the town can't do this or
 
02:00:11.189 --> 02:00:11.199 align:start position:0%
can't adopt a a an individual Amendment
 
02:00:14.430 --> 02:00:14.440 align:start position:0%
to the code the problem is is in one
 
02:00:15.750 --> 02:00:15.760 align:start position:0%
section you're gonna you're probably
 
02:00:18.229 --> 02:00:18.239 align:start position:0%
going to highlight adopting completely
 
02:00:20.589 --> 02:00:20.599 align:start position:0%
different codes and whatever it could be
 
02:00:23.109 --> 02:00:23.119 align:start position:0%
that would be a huge conf for us because
 
02:00:25.830 --> 02:00:25.840 align:start position:0%
it doesn't match it completely takes out
 
02:00:28.870 --> 02:00:28.880 align:start position:0%
what everybody's trained to do so this
 
02:00:31.270 --> 02:00:31.280 align:start position:0%
bill tries to put in guard rails and I
 
02:00:34.350 --> 02:00:34.360 align:start position:0%
put it as guard rails to keep everybody
 
02:00:36.990 --> 02:00:37.000 align:start position:0%
moving in the same direction and then we
 
02:00:38.750 --> 02:00:38.760 align:start position:0%
work on the next code in the building
 
02:00:40.750 --> 02:00:40.760 align:start position:0%
code review board and the experts work
 
02:00:44.030 --> 02:00:44.040 align:start position:0%
on it so I think this bill it may be a
 
02:00:45.950 --> 02:00:45.960 align:start position:0%
little fuzzy things now but it's nowhere
 
02:00:48.350 --> 02:00:48.360 align:start position:0%
near how fuzzy the one we had already
 
02:00:51.149 --> 02:00:51.159 align:start position:0%
passed this bill clears up a lot and
 
02:00:54.149 --> 02:00:54.159 align:start position:0%
sets in the guard rails for the future
 
02:00:57.470 --> 02:00:57.480 align:start position:0%
so we're here in total support of this
 
02:00:59.950 --> 02:00:59.960 align:start position:0%
new language that helps give it
 
02:01:03.069 --> 02:01:03.079 align:start position:0%
guidelines for cities and towns because
 
02:01:05.109 --> 02:01:05.119 align:start position:0%
the other issue that this addresses if
 
02:01:08.910 --> 02:01:08.920 align:start position:0%
it's filed we know it is a legally
 
02:01:12.109 --> 02:01:12.119 align:start position:0%
approved amendment by the town we don't
 
02:01:14.910 --> 02:01:14.920 align:start position:0%
want somebody just changing a building
 
02:01:17.270 --> 02:01:17.280 align:start position:0%
code that hasn't gone through the
 
02:01:20.030 --> 02:01:20.040 align:start position:0%
process with the town to get it legal
 
02:01:21.750 --> 02:01:21.760 align:start position:0%
and then get it filed when it goes to
 
02:01:24.030 --> 02:01:24.040 align:start position:0%
the the state so there is a couple of
 
02:01:26.350 --> 02:01:26.360 align:start position:0%
things that this does for us so we're
 
02:01:28.950 --> 02:01:28.960 align:start position:0%
here in total support of this amendment
 
02:01:31.830 --> 02:01:31.840 align:start position:0%
that you've got and uh we appreciate and
 
02:01:34.669 --> 02:01:34.679 align:start position:0%
like to have you guys ought to pass
 
02:01:36.629 --> 02:01:36.639 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you very much
 
02:01:39.430 --> 02:01:39.440 align:start position:0%
any questions uh yeah representative
 
02:01:40.210 --> 02:01:40.220 align:start position:0%
schmi and then
 
02:01:40.220 --> 02:01:41.589 align:start position:0%
schmi and then
[Music]

02:01:41.589 --> 02:01:41.599 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:01:44.629 --> 02:01:44.639 align:start position:0%
Fitzpatrick thank you Mr chairman so you
 
02:01:47.270 --> 02:01:47.280 align:start position:0%
heard Bill McKenna just now talk about
 
02:01:50.229 --> 02:01:50.239 align:start position:0%
his issues uh I'm sure that's not
 
02:01:52.350 --> 02:01:52.360 align:start position:0%
something you never heard of before
 
02:01:54.790 --> 02:01:54.800 align:start position:0%
so what's your position on his
 
02:01:56.790 --> 02:01:56.800 align:start position:0%
reservations well I I think his
 
02:01:59.430 --> 02:01:59.440 align:start position:0%
reservations are and this is just I
 
02:02:01.189 --> 02:02:01.199 align:start position:0%
don't want to offend him at all but it's
 
02:02:04.310 --> 02:02:04.320 align:start position:0%
it's more on the minor side of you know
 
02:02:07.589 --> 02:02:07.599 align:start position:0%
what happens when your amendment is no
 
02:02:09.790 --> 02:02:09.800 align:start position:0%
longer matching up with what the new
 
02:02:11.910 --> 02:02:11.920 align:start position:0%
code is I think that's where it's
 
02:02:13.950 --> 02:02:13.960 align:start position:0%
putting in language to
 
02:02:16.830 --> 02:02:16.840 align:start position:0%
say that Amendment doesn't apply anymore
 
02:02:19.950 --> 02:02:19.960 align:start position:0%
it's got to go away somehow and uh I
 
02:02:21.910 --> 02:02:21.920 align:start position:0%
think that's what's in here it's not in
 
02:02:23.910 --> 02:02:23.920 align:start position:0%
intended to go away like we're ignoring
 
02:02:27.270 --> 02:02:27.280 align:start position:0%
it but it has to go away in some process
 
02:02:29.709 --> 02:02:29.719 align:start position:0%
and I don't think this is the end all I
 
02:02:31.830 --> 02:02:31.840 align:start position:0%
I imagine in the future you're going to
 
02:02:34.229 --> 02:02:34.239 align:start position:0%
deal with some of those issues as we get
 
02:02:36.910 --> 02:02:36.920 align:start position:0%
more clarity but I think this is a great
 
02:02:36.920 --> 02:02:38.189 align:start position:0%
more clarity but I think this is a great
step

02:02:38.189 --> 02:02:38.199 align:start position:0%
step
 
02:02:40.950 --> 02:02:40.960 align:start position:0%
forward so if if it goes to the
 
02:02:43.030 --> 02:02:43.040 align:start position:0%
subcommittee as it may you're going to
 
02:02:44.589 --> 02:02:44.599 align:start position:0%
be you guys going to be available to
 
02:02:48.189 --> 02:02:48.199 align:start position:0%
help us work this out sure thank you
 
02:02:50.870 --> 02:02:50.880 align:start position:0%
representative Fitzpatrick thank you m
 
02:02:55.669 --> 02:02:55.679 align:start position:0%
Mr chair um just to uh clarify I'm 100%
 
02:02:57.910 --> 02:02:57.920 align:start position:0%
in favor of Statewide building codes and
 
02:03:01.350 --> 02:03:01.360 align:start position:0%
I could even be Co convinced that that
 
02:03:03.229 --> 02:03:03.239 align:start position:0%
local governments don't have the ability
 
02:03:06.870 --> 02:03:06.880 align:start position:0%
to adopt anything more more stringent
 
02:03:10.030 --> 02:03:10.040 align:start position:0%
but I'm having a very difficult time
 
02:03:12.510 --> 02:03:12.520 align:start position:0%
being told that uh local local
 
02:03:14.830 --> 02:03:14.840 align:start position:0%
governments can adopt a building codes
 
02:03:17.390 --> 02:03:17.400 align:start position:0%
more uh more AR stringent when I'm
 
02:03:22.870 --> 02:03:22.880 align:start position:0%
reading again on uh page page three
 
02:03:28.030 --> 02:03:28.040 align:start position:0%
lines four and five and six that uh
 
02:03:29.669 --> 02:03:29.679 align:start position:0%
local governments don't have that
 
02:03:32.470 --> 02:03:32.480 align:start position:0%
ability so could you help me und
 
02:03:37.470 --> 02:03:37.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:40.510 --> 02:03:40.520 align:start position:0%
seeing I guess I would prefer the two
 
02:03:43.149 --> 02:03:43.159 align:start position:0%
experts that are in the room okay so you
 
02:03:44.629 --> 02:03:44.639 align:start position:0%
can't answer that question yeah I would
 
02:03:47.430 --> 02:03:47.440 align:start position:0%
prefer to you know the whole Enforcement
 
02:03:49.790 --> 02:03:49.800 align:start position:0%
issue from the Fire Marshall and the
 
02:03:51.950 --> 02:03:51.960 align:start position:0%
other it might be appropriate with those
 
02:03:54.830 --> 02:03:54.840 align:start position:0%
answering the question okay thank
 
02:03:57.910 --> 02:03:57.920 align:start position:0%
you yes representative man py thank you
 
02:04:02.790 --> 02:04:02.800 align:start position:0%
Mr chair with regards to building codes
 
02:04:06.750 --> 02:04:06.760 align:start position:0%
for multifam with the housing crisis
 
02:04:11.549 --> 02:04:11.559 align:start position:0%
more like 150 to 100 units that would be
 
02:04:16.069 --> 02:04:16.079 align:start position:0%
more commercial correct so how does that
 
02:04:19.470 --> 02:04:19.480 align:start position:0%
impact if the building codes that the
 
02:04:24.030 --> 02:04:24.040 align:start position:0%
state laid out is is 3 to four years
 
02:04:28.310 --> 02:04:28.320 align:start position:0%
behind we are adopting just now 2021 we
 
02:04:29.950 --> 02:04:29.960 align:start position:0%
are in
 
02:04:32.310 --> 02:04:32.320 align:start position:0%
2024 well well there's rule when you get
 
02:04:35.069 --> 02:04:35.079 align:start position:0%
into codes there's rules like when it
 
02:04:37.830 --> 02:04:37.840 align:start position:0%
becomes effective in a grace period for
 
02:04:39.910 --> 02:04:39.920 align:start position:0%
those that are in the process of
 
02:04:42.790 --> 02:04:42.800 align:start position:0%
developing those large projects to get
 
02:04:45.430 --> 02:04:45.440 align:start position:0%
it approved and going so they don't have
 
02:04:47.390 --> 02:04:47.400 align:start position:0%
to make the adjustment to the latest
 
02:04:50.549 --> 02:04:50.559 align:start position:0%
code but at the same time most
 
02:04:52.870 --> 02:04:52.880 align:start position:0%
contractors of they know when these
 
02:04:55.189 --> 02:04:55.199 align:start position:0%
codes are coming they they know they
 
02:04:57.430 --> 02:04:57.440 align:start position:0%
know through guys like me that we're
 
02:05:00.790 --> 02:05:00.800 align:start position:0%
updating the codes to the 21 code I I
 
02:05:04.270 --> 02:05:04.280 align:start position:0%
hadn't finished my question in terms of
 
02:05:06.069 --> 02:05:06.079 align:start position:0%
how would it impact not just the
 
02:05:10.270 --> 02:05:10.280 align:start position:0%
insurance but also financing investor
 
02:05:13.910 --> 02:05:13.920 align:start position:0%
financing if the basic code is not
 
02:05:18.510 --> 02:05:18.520 align:start position:0%
available in a state for example cpce is
 
02:05:22.669 --> 02:05:22.679 align:start position:0%
not available then the funding which can
 
02:05:27.310 --> 02:05:27.320 align:start position:0%
cover 30 to 40% of a large building will
 
02:05:30.790 --> 02:05:30.800 align:start position:0%
not come in to the state to provide the
 
02:05:34.189 --> 02:05:34.199 align:start position:0%
investment so how would that offset or
 
02:05:37.990 --> 02:05:38.000 align:start position:0%
is there a provision for developers to
 
02:05:42.390 --> 02:05:42.400 align:start position:0%
uh meet that I I guess what I would I
 
02:05:45.790 --> 02:05:45.800 align:start position:0%
don't think this bill does anything
 
02:05:48.149 --> 02:05:48.159 align:start position:0%
regarding that this really deals with
 
02:05:51.069 --> 02:05:51.079 align:start position:0%
just amendments by the municipality to
 
02:05:53.510 --> 02:05:53.520 align:start position:0%
the state Wide building code it doesn't
 
02:05:54.629 --> 02:05:54.639 align:start position:0%
really go
 
02:05:57.990 --> 02:05:58.000 align:start position:0%
into the code change and the financial
 
02:06:01.910 --> 02:06:01.920 align:start position:0%
impact I think that's I think that's
 
02:06:04.390 --> 02:06:04.400 align:start position:0%
fair any further
 
02:06:06.310 --> 02:06:06.320 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you for your
 
02:06:07.950 --> 02:06:07.960 align:start position:0%
testimony thank
 
02:06:10.910 --> 02:06:10.920 align:start position:0%
you Philip Sherman building code review
 
02:06:16.510 --> 02:06:16.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:18.990 --> 02:06:19.000 align:start position:0%
599 thank you Mr chair members of the
 
02:06:21.189 --> 02:06:21.199 align:start position:0%
committee um for the record my name is
 
02:06:22.390 --> 02:06:22.400 align:start position:0%
Philip chairman the chair of the
 
02:06:24.470 --> 02:06:24.480 align:start position:0%
building code review board speak in
 
02:06:28.310 --> 02:06:28.320 align:start position:0%
support of SP 437 as amended um I have
 
02:06:29.910 --> 02:06:29.920 align:start position:0%
some prepared remarks and then I can
 
02:06:31.589 --> 02:06:31.599 align:start position:0%
cover some of the questions that are are
 
02:06:34.629 --> 02:06:34.639 align:start position:0%
sort of outstanding here uh so first
 
02:06:37.189 --> 02:06:37.199 align:start position:0%
local governments have been required to
 
02:06:38.750 --> 02:06:38.760 align:start position:0%
provide their local
 
02:06:42.069 --> 02:06:42.079 align:start position:0%
amendments uh to the building code
 
02:06:44.229 --> 02:06:44.239 align:start position:0%
review board for posting on the website
 
02:06:47.669 --> 02:06:47.679 align:start position:0%
for a long time now a total of five
 
02:06:50.549 --> 02:06:50.559 align:start position:0%
municipalities have done so we have a
 
02:06:52.390 --> 02:06:52.400 align:start position:0%
problem here
 
02:06:54.350 --> 02:06:54.360 align:start position:0%
uh the requirement to submit all code
 
02:06:56.510 --> 02:06:56.520 align:start position:0%
amendments and their enabling ordinances
 
02:06:58.750 --> 02:06:58.760 align:start position:0%
for review does not raise the bar for
 
02:07:01.229 --> 02:07:01.239 align:start position:0%
any amendments this is information that
 
02:07:03.790 --> 02:07:03.800 align:start position:0%
was supposed to be submitted in the past
 
02:07:06.709 --> 02:07:06.719 align:start position:0%
anyway the additional prohibition on
 
02:07:08.709 --> 02:07:08.719 align:start position:0%
adopting later additions of the model
 
02:07:10.629 --> 02:07:10.639 align:start position:0%
codes included in the State Building
 
02:07:13.709 --> 02:07:13.719 align:start position:0%
Code attempts to resurrect the original
 
02:07:16.270 --> 02:07:16.280 align:start position:0%
intent that the State Building Code
 
02:07:19.030 --> 02:07:19.040 align:start position:0%
would apply Statewide with limited
 
02:07:21.510 --> 02:07:21.520 align:start position:0%
amendments but not that entire code
 
02:07:24.149 --> 02:07:24.159 align:start position:0%
codes would be replaced by the
 
02:07:27.149 --> 02:07:27.159 align:start position:0%
municipality we can't have it both ways
 
02:07:29.589 --> 02:07:29.599 align:start position:0%
either we have a Statewide building code
 
02:07:31.709 --> 02:07:31.719 align:start position:0%
or we pretty much go back to a Time
 
02:07:35.109 --> 02:07:35.119 align:start position:0%
prior to 2002 where every town and city
 
02:07:36.750 --> 02:07:36.760 align:start position:0%
does whatever they
 
02:07:39.750 --> 02:07:39.760 align:start position:0%
want having multiple codes in effect is
 
02:07:42.069 --> 02:07:42.079 align:start position:0%
problematic at a number of levels
 
02:07:44.709 --> 02:07:44.719 align:start position:0%
electricians plumbers gas Fitters and
 
02:07:47.669 --> 02:07:47.679 align:start position:0%
others answer to licensing boards and
 
02:07:49.910 --> 02:07:49.920 align:start position:0%
the continuing education requirements
 
02:07:52.549 --> 02:07:52.559 align:start position:0%
based on the State Building code
 
02:07:54.350 --> 02:07:54.360 align:start position:0%
training for building officials is
 
02:07:56.430 --> 02:07:56.440 align:start position:0%
provided based on the current State
 
02:07:59.430 --> 02:07:59.440 align:start position:0%
Building Code frequently local code
 
02:08:01.629 --> 02:08:01.639 align:start position:0%
adoption and perhaps the amendment
 
02:08:03.830 --> 02:08:03.840 align:start position:0%
process are driven by one or more
 
02:08:06.270 --> 02:08:06.280 align:start position:0%
forceful individuals at a single point
 
02:08:09.709 --> 02:08:09.719 align:start position:0%
in time then voted on by a small subset
 
02:08:12.069 --> 02:08:12.079 align:start position:0%
of the people impacted by the code
 
02:08:14.030 --> 02:08:14.040 align:start position:0%
because obviously only residents of that
 
02:08:16.510 --> 02:08:16.520 align:start position:0%
town are voting on
 
02:08:19.790 --> 02:08:19.800 align:start position:0%
it this bypasses the more democratic
 
02:08:22.830 --> 02:08:22.840 align:start position:0%
process at the state level involving all
 
02:08:26.589 --> 02:08:26.599 align:start position:0%
interested groups the bcrb the
 
02:08:28.830 --> 02:08:28.840 align:start position:0%
legislature and ultimately the
 
02:08:31.229 --> 02:08:31.239 align:start position:0%
governor the proposed amendment would
 
02:08:34.030 --> 02:08:34.040 align:start position:0%
make existing ordinances adopting later
 
02:08:36.790 --> 02:08:36.800 align:start position:0%
additions of the model codes invalid and
 
02:08:39.270 --> 02:08:39.280 align:start position:0%
makes it clear that adopting most or all
 
02:08:41.350 --> 02:08:41.360 align:start position:0%
of a new code through multiple
 
02:08:44.270 --> 02:08:44.280 align:start position:0%
amendments hand us 500 amendments to get
 
02:08:47.750 --> 02:08:47.760 align:start position:0%
to a new code is not permitted so the
 
02:08:50.750 --> 02:08:50.760 align:start position:0%
existing language is ambiguous it
 
02:08:53.069 --> 02:08:53.079 align:start position:0%
basically says says to something to the
 
02:08:55.549 --> 02:08:55.559 align:start position:0%
effect that municipalities can adopt
 
02:08:57.669 --> 02:08:57.679 align:start position:0%
codes that are not in the State Building
 
02:09:00.510 --> 02:09:00.520 align:start position:0%
Code the reason that that's there and it
 
02:09:03.430 --> 02:09:03.440 align:start position:0%
and it remains is to permit the adoption
 
02:09:05.549 --> 02:09:05.559 align:start position:0%
of housing codes Property Maintenance
 
02:09:07.430 --> 02:09:07.440 align:start position:0%
codes and things like that which many of
 
02:09:09.149 --> 02:09:09.159 align:start position:0%
the at least of the larger cities have
 
02:09:12.109 --> 02:09:12.119 align:start position:0%
done and that's not the problem here the
 
02:09:14.229 --> 02:09:14.239 align:start position:0%
problem is adopting later additions of
 
02:09:16.629 --> 02:09:16.639 align:start position:0%
the codes that are in fact in the State
 
02:09:20.030 --> 02:09:20.040 align:start position:0%
Building Code so this proposed amend
 
02:09:21.950 --> 02:09:21.960 align:start position:0%
proposed bill as amended
 
02:09:23.669 --> 02:09:23.679 align:start position:0%
tries to correct two long-standing
 
02:09:25.549 --> 02:09:25.559 align:start position:0%
problems with the local amendment
 
02:09:28.950 --> 02:09:28.960 align:start position:0%
process one as previously testified the
 
02:09:31.430 --> 02:09:31.440 align:start position:0%
lack of an ability to have a cohesive
 
02:09:34.189 --> 02:09:34.199 align:start position:0%
location in other words our website
 
02:09:35.990 --> 02:09:36.000 align:start position:0%
where somebody can say here are all the
 
02:09:38.950 --> 02:09:38.960 align:start position:0%
local amendments that apply and two this
 
02:09:41.390 --> 02:09:41.400 align:start position:0%
issue of adopting later additions of the
 
02:09:45.069 --> 02:09:45.079 align:start position:0%
model codes which basically deletes the
 
02:09:47.790 --> 02:09:47.800 align:start position:0%
idea of a Statewide building code happy
 
02:09:49.229 --> 02:09:49.239 align:start position:0%
to answer any
 
02:09:52.229 --> 02:09:52.239 align:start position:0%
questions thank you representative us
 
02:09:54.589 --> 02:09:54.599 align:start position:0%
thank you um don't want to get into
 
02:09:56.709 --> 02:09:56.719 align:start position:0%
detail on this here but could you send a
 
02:10:01.669 --> 02:10:01.679 align:start position:0%
link to uh if you have it to at least
 
02:10:04.669 --> 02:10:04.679 align:start position:0%
the uh Municipal amendments or updates
 
02:10:06.549 --> 02:10:06.559 align:start position:0%
the building code um at least the ones
 
02:10:08.990 --> 02:10:09.000 align:start position:0%
you've been informed of as you should be
 
02:10:10.750 --> 02:10:10.760 align:start position:0%
I'd like to get a feel for what kind of
 
02:10:12.390 --> 02:10:12.400 align:start position:0%
uh things the uh municipalities are
 
02:10:15.350 --> 02:10:15.360 align:start position:0%
actually trying to do I will be happy to
 
02:10:17.709 --> 02:10:17.719 align:start position:0%
work with the State Fire Marshall in
 
02:10:20.229 --> 02:10:20.239 align:start position:0%
that our website just got restrung to a
 
02:10:22.709 --> 02:10:22.719 align:start position:0%
new system and I'm still coming up to
 
02:10:25.030 --> 02:10:25.040 align:start position:0%
speed on where various things are I'll
 
02:10:27.950 --> 02:10:27.960 align:start position:0%
find it for you all right thank you
 
02:10:32.069 --> 02:10:32.079 align:start position:0%
represent fuk then thank you is the
 
02:10:34.350 --> 02:10:34.360 align:start position:0%
intent of this
 
02:10:34.360 --> 02:10:36.270 align:start position:0%
intent of this
bill

02:10:36.270 --> 02:10:36.280 align:start position:0%
bill
 
02:10:43.669 --> 02:10:43.679 align:start position:0%
to only make uh local uh changes
 
02:10:46.549 --> 02:10:46.559 align:start position:0%
enforceable if they go through the
 
02:10:50.030 --> 02:10:50.040 align:start position:0%
process of the of the
 
02:10:53.270 --> 02:10:53.280 align:start position:0%
submission and let me and but in other
 
02:10:55.950 --> 02:10:55.960 align:start position:0%
words they're not enforced they won't be
 
02:11:00.830 --> 02:11:00.840 align:start position:0%
enforced if they're not submitted to uh
 
02:11:04.549 --> 02:11:04.559 align:start position:0%
the office to be re reviewed and
 
02:11:08.390 --> 02:11:08.400 align:start position:0%
commented on but if they are then they
 
02:11:10.830 --> 02:11:10.840 align:start position:0%
are in enforceable this what I'm trying
 
02:11:14.189 --> 02:11:14.199 align:start position:0%
to understand this and please let let me
 
02:11:17.109 --> 02:11:17.119 align:start position:0%
see if I can can parse that out first
 
02:11:19.189 --> 02:11:19.199 align:start position:0%
there was a question about review and
 
02:11:21.870 --> 02:11:21.880 align:start position:0%
Confirmation those were carefully worked
 
02:11:25.830 --> 02:11:25.840 align:start position:0%
out terms when we did the original uh
 
02:11:28.830 --> 02:11:28.840 align:start position:0%
have the bcrb review these prior to that
 
02:11:30.149 --> 02:11:30.159 align:start position:0%
all they had to do was send them in we
 
02:11:31.669 --> 02:11:31.679 align:start position:0%
didn't even read them just post them but
 
02:11:34.790 --> 02:11:34.800 align:start position:0%
nobody did that so as of I think January
 
02:11:34.800 --> 02:11:35.549 align:start position:0%
nobody did that so as of I think January
of

02:11:35.549 --> 02:11:35.559 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:11:39.030 --> 02:11:39.040 align:start position:0%
23 we started to review and confirm
 
02:11:41.430 --> 02:11:41.440 align:start position:0%
these the reason that those words were
 
02:11:44.470 --> 02:11:44.480 align:start position:0%
used is we have absolutely nothing to
 
02:11:47.149 --> 02:11:47.159 align:start position:0%
say about the technical validity of any
 
02:11:49.589 --> 02:11:49.599 align:start position:0%
of these amendments all we're looking
 
02:11:51.990 --> 02:11:52.000 align:start position:0%
for is to be sure one one that they were
 
02:11:53.709 --> 02:11:53.719 align:start position:0%
legally adopted through whatever
 
02:11:56.790 --> 02:11:56.800 align:start position:0%
ordinance process applies and two that
 
02:11:58.390 --> 02:11:58.400 align:start position:0%
they're more stringent than the state
 
02:12:01.069 --> 02:12:01.079 align:start position:0%
code or they not less stringent and
 
02:12:03.189 --> 02:12:03.199 align:start position:0%
three that they don't conflict with the
 
02:12:05.030 --> 02:12:05.040 align:start position:0%
fire code by simply reviewing it with
 
02:12:08.030 --> 02:12:08.040 align:start position:0%
the State Fire Marshal so if somebody
 
02:12:10.549 --> 02:12:10.559 align:start position:0%
wants to you know tell you you need a 20
 
02:12:12.549 --> 02:12:12.559 align:start position:0%
foot high ceiling in this room that's
 
02:12:14.149 --> 02:12:14.159 align:start position:0%
not what we're looking at all we're
 
02:12:17.310 --> 02:12:17.320 align:start position:0%
saying is the code says 76 you say 20
 
02:12:20.109 --> 02:12:20.119 align:start position:0%
check on you go have a legal ordinance
 
02:12:22.189 --> 02:12:22.199 align:start position:0%
it doesn't conflict with the fire code
 
02:12:25.350 --> 02:12:25.360 align:start position:0%
that's all we've done um furthermore
 
02:12:27.709 --> 02:12:27.719 align:start position:0%
there are three main areas that we don't
 
02:12:29.990 --> 02:12:30.000 align:start position:0%
even look at and that's permitting
 
02:12:32.830 --> 02:12:32.840 align:start position:0%
process fee structures and certificates
 
02:12:35.109 --> 02:12:35.119 align:start position:0%
of occupancy so those for many years
 
02:12:36.669 --> 02:12:36.679 align:start position:0%
have been reserved for the Loca
 
02:12:40.549 --> 02:12:40.559 align:start position:0%
municipalities and we defined the uh our
 
02:12:44.229 --> 02:12:44.239 align:start position:0%
review ordinance the part of 155a and
 
02:12:46.669 --> 02:12:46.679 align:start position:0%
67451 to eliminate those so you don't
 
02:12:52.589 --> 02:12:52.599 align:start position:0%
have to send them to us um so basic
 
02:12:56.189 --> 02:12:56.199 align:start position:0%
if the city of Nashua adopted a legal
 
02:12:58.470 --> 02:12:58.480 align:start position:0%
ordinance all they do is just send us
 
02:13:00.790 --> 02:13:00.800 align:start position:0%
the link and they're done it's legal
 
02:13:02.790 --> 02:13:02.800 align:start position:0%
it's there we'll take a quick peek at it
 
02:13:04.589 --> 02:13:04.599 align:start position:0%
yep it's more stringent or nope it
 
02:13:07.229 --> 02:13:07.239 align:start position:0%
doesn't apply and then they're finished
 
02:13:09.390 --> 02:13:09.400 align:start position:0%
so nobody is coming back and saying that
 
02:13:12.910 --> 02:13:12.920 align:start position:0%
a legally adopted ordinance is no longer
 
02:13:15.350 --> 02:13:15.360 align:start position:0%
valid I think just for clarification on
 
02:13:17.189 --> 02:13:17.199 align:start position:0%
that there in your example State
 
02:13:19.109 --> 02:13:19.119 align:start position:0%
Building Code says 7 and2 ft Portsmouth
 
02:13:21.830 --> 02:13:21.840 align:start position:0%
wants it to be 20t if they don't submit
 
02:13:23.950 --> 02:13:23.960 align:start position:0%
that to you in the process can they
 
02:13:26.109 --> 02:13:26.119 align:start position:0%
enforce that can they still enforce the
 
02:13:28.870 --> 02:13:28.880 align:start position:0%
20 that's what this bill is trying to do
 
02:13:31.430 --> 02:13:31.440 align:start position:0%
is to force them to submit it for two
 
02:13:34.390 --> 02:13:34.400 align:start position:0%
reasons one to check the the issues and
 
02:13:37.069 --> 02:13:37.079 align:start position:0%
two to provide this list of local
 
02:13:39.189 --> 02:13:39.199 align:start position:0%
amendments on the website so people know
 
02:13:41.069 --> 02:13:41.079 align:start position:0%
what they've got to got to deal with so
 
02:13:42.549 --> 02:13:42.559 align:start position:0%
if this were to pass it would not be
 
02:13:44.870 --> 02:13:44.880 align:start position:0%
enforcable until they came to
 
02:13:47.430 --> 02:13:47.440 align:start position:0%
you if they have a legal ordinance all
 
02:13:49.350 --> 02:13:49.360 align:start position:0%
they have to do is send us to us within
 
02:13:52.910 --> 02:13:52.920 align:start position:0%
60 days and they're done then we'll look
 
02:13:55.229 --> 02:13:55.239 align:start position:0%
at it and provided it was
 
02:13:59.510 --> 02:13:59.520 align:start position:0%
legal no no mus no fuss uh thank you I
 
02:14:01.430 --> 02:14:01.440 align:start position:0%
all right I understand what you're what
 
02:14:04.589 --> 02:14:04.599 align:start position:0%
you're doing now thank you uh I support
 
02:14:06.350 --> 02:14:06.360 align:start position:0%
it but I do think that this uh bill
 
02:14:07.830 --> 02:14:07.840 align:start position:0%
needs some clarification and it's
 
02:14:10.669 --> 02:14:10.679 align:start position:0%
wording thank you representative meny
 
02:14:13.030 --> 02:14:13.040 align:start position:0%
and then representative L thank you Mr
 
02:14:14.990 --> 02:14:15.000 align:start position:0%
chair so you
 
02:14:19.470 --> 02:14:19.480 align:start position:0%
mentioned uh something with the five
 
02:14:22.709 --> 02:14:22.719 align:start position:0%
commune municipalities ities have
 
02:14:26.990 --> 02:14:27.000 align:start position:0%
adopted or submitted Amendment out of
 
02:14:30.430 --> 02:14:30.440 align:start position:0%
280 some municipalities in state of New
 
02:14:33.189 --> 02:14:33.199 align:start position:0%
Hampshire was this the amendment to the
 
02:14:36.430 --> 02:14:36.440 align:start position:0%
code that building state code that they
 
02:14:40.750 --> 02:14:40.760 align:start position:0%
wanted to amend or what was in relation
 
02:14:43.750 --> 02:14:43.760 align:start position:0%
I didn't quite get your point on that so
 
02:14:45.310 --> 02:14:45.320 align:start position:0%
there are 200 and some odd
 
02:14:47.669 --> 02:14:47.679 align:start position:0%
municipalities somewhere around half of
 
02:14:50.030 --> 02:14:50.040 align:start position:0%
those enforc the Statewide building code
 
02:14:52.589 --> 02:14:52.599 align:start position:0%
the others Statewide code applies but
 
02:14:54.870 --> 02:14:54.880 align:start position:0%
the towns are not enforcing it so they
 
02:14:56.069 --> 02:14:56.079 align:start position:0%
don't have any amendments because
 
02:14:58.430 --> 02:14:58.440 align:start position:0%
they're not enforcing It Anyway of the
 
02:15:01.629 --> 02:15:01.639 align:start position:0%
towns that towns and cities that do have
 
02:15:04.549 --> 02:15:04.559 align:start position:0%
amendments uh we don't know how many
 
02:15:07.069 --> 02:15:07.079 align:start position:0%
there were we only know that five of
 
02:15:10.510 --> 02:15:10.520 align:start position:0%
them have sent it to us so it's this
 
02:15:13.149 --> 02:15:13.159 align:start position:0%
it's this old requirement just to send
 
02:15:15.549 --> 02:15:15.559 align:start position:0%
them for posting that isn't even wasn't
 
02:15:17.910 --> 02:15:17.920 align:start position:0%
even being complied with and we know
 
02:15:20.069 --> 02:15:20.079 align:start position:0%
that there are many more than five who
 
02:15:21.709 --> 02:15:21.719 align:start position:0%
have amendments because we can go on the
 
02:15:25.750 --> 02:15:25.760 align:start position:0%
website and look at them represent m y
 
02:15:29.109 --> 02:15:29.119 align:start position:0%
thank you so follow up to that is this
 
02:15:31.870 --> 02:15:31.880 align:start position:0%
bill clarifying that if they haven't
 
02:15:34.229 --> 02:15:34.239 align:start position:0%
submitted there's an amendment there's a
 
02:15:38.390 --> 02:15:38.400 align:start position:0%
penalty or enforcement that they have to
 
02:15:41.189 --> 02:15:41.199 align:start position:0%
submit is their provision on this this
 
02:15:44.270 --> 02:15:44.280 align:start position:0%
this basically forces them to send it to
 
02:15:47.709 --> 02:15:47.719 align:start position:0%
us it just recycles that process because
 
02:15:50.270 --> 02:15:50.280 align:start position:0%
so many of the municipalities were not
 
02:15:53.149 --> 02:15:53.159 align:start position:0%
not following anyway this forces them to
 
02:15:55.549 --> 02:15:55.559 align:start position:0%
send it to us or they can't enforce the
 
02:15:59.510 --> 02:15:59.520 align:start position:0%
thing representative leus thank you um
 
02:16:00.990 --> 02:16:01.000 align:start position:0%
so a number of times you're talking
 
02:16:03.870 --> 02:16:03.880 align:start position:0%
about a legal ordinance does the for it
 
02:16:06.510 --> 02:16:06.520 align:start position:0%
to be legal does that mean that it's met
 
02:16:08.189 --> 02:16:08.199 align:start position:0%
those three things that you said you
 
02:16:10.629 --> 02:16:10.639 align:start position:0%
review or is it does it mean something
 
02:16:14.390 --> 02:16:14.400 align:start position:0%
else we became aware uh within the last
 
02:16:16.750 --> 02:16:16.760 align:start position:0%
month or so of a town that was using
 
02:16:18.950 --> 02:16:18.960 align:start position:0%
their zoning board of appeals as the
 
02:16:20.629 --> 02:16:20.639 align:start position:0%
building code review or building code
 
02:16:22.750 --> 02:16:22.760 align:start position:0%
appeal F board and never had an
 
02:16:27.629 --> 02:16:27.639 align:start position:0%
ordinance to do that we're much aware of
 
02:16:30.149 --> 02:16:30.159 align:start position:0%
local officials over time a little less
 
02:16:32.190 --> 02:16:32.200 align:start position:0%
of it now just saying this is what I
 
02:16:35.990 --> 02:16:36.000 align:start position:0%
want in my town so the whole process was
 
02:16:38.150 --> 02:16:38.160 align:start position:0%
intended to say this has to be done
 
02:16:40.070 --> 02:16:40.080 align:start position:0%
through an ordinance that or you know
 
02:16:42.790 --> 02:16:42.800 align:start position:0%
the appropriate legal process to adopt
 
02:16:47.950 --> 02:16:47.960 align:start position:0%
these follow up follow up um so it it's
 
02:16:50.910 --> 02:16:50.920 align:start position:0%
a legal process even if it let's say is
 
02:16:52.389 --> 02:16:52.399 align:start position:0%
less stringent the existing building
 
02:16:54.070 --> 02:16:54.080 align:start position:0%
code or tries to replace the whole code
 
02:16:56.270 --> 02:16:56.280 align:start position:0%
or the other thing there was another
 
02:16:59.110 --> 02:16:59.120 align:start position:0%
well no that was it um cuz you said that
 
02:17:02.309 --> 02:17:02.319 align:start position:0%
if they submit it to you within 16 days
 
02:17:04.509 --> 02:17:04.519 align:start position:0%
as long as it's a legal ordinance which
 
02:17:05.830 --> 02:17:05.840 align:start position:0%
from what you just said would mean that
 
02:17:07.830 --> 02:17:07.840 align:start position:0%
it's been adopted through some legal
 
02:17:10.750 --> 02:17:10.760 align:start position:0%
process that they can then enforce it
 
02:17:14.070 --> 02:17:14.080 align:start position:0%
but the bill I think says that it has to
 
02:17:16.270 --> 02:17:16.280 align:start position:0%
be confirmed let's say there was an
 
02:17:19.709 --> 02:17:19.719 align:start position:0%
ordinance adopted that that provided for
 
02:17:21.910 --> 02:17:21.920 align:start position:0%
a requirement that was less stringent
 
02:17:24.190 --> 02:17:24.200 align:start position:0%
than the building code was never legal
 
02:17:27.110 --> 02:17:27.120 align:start position:0%
in the first place okay all right thank
 
02:17:29.950 --> 02:17:29.960 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
02:17:33.110 --> 02:17:33.120 align:start position:0%
Schmidt thank you Mr chairman so I think
 
02:17:35.790 --> 02:17:35.800 align:start position:0%
we're all I think we we're all concerned
 
02:17:40.469 --> 02:17:40.479 align:start position:0%
about situations where uh a lack of
 
02:17:43.429 --> 02:17:43.439 align:start position:0%
Standards puts people at risk but aren't
 
02:17:48.030 --> 02:17:48.040 align:start position:0%
the building code officials and and uh
 
02:17:49.589 --> 02:17:49.599 align:start position:0%
like the general
 
02:17:52.589 --> 02:17:52.599 align:start position:0%
contractors those those people Al also
 
02:17:55.509 --> 02:17:55.519 align:start position:0%
have ethical responsibilities don't they
 
02:17:57.589 --> 02:17:57.599 align:start position:0%
so that in the smaller towns where they
 
02:18:00.309 --> 02:18:00.319 align:start position:0%
don't have the necessary
 
02:18:02.870 --> 02:18:02.880 align:start position:0%
infrastructure regulation wise and so
 
02:18:04.950 --> 02:18:04.960 align:start position:0%
forth to oversee it where it's
 
02:18:04.960 --> 02:18:06.270 align:start position:0%
forth to oversee it where it's
potentially

02:18:06.270 --> 02:18:06.280 align:start position:0%
potentially
 
02:18:10.629 --> 02:18:10.639 align:start position:0%
the excuse me the silman's
 
02:18:14.389 --> 02:18:14.399 align:start position:0%
brother-in-law who uh is maybe building
 
02:18:17.469 --> 02:18:17.479 align:start position:0%
things and so forth where you get
 
02:18:23.030 --> 02:18:23.040 align:start position:0%
sloppiness or or failure to comply with
 
02:18:26.270 --> 02:18:26.280 align:start position:0%
safety standards and so forth but but
 
02:18:29.589 --> 02:18:29.599 align:start position:0%
aren't we somewhat protected because the
 
02:18:32.469 --> 02:18:32.479 align:start position:0%
contractors also are supposed to be
 
02:18:34.629 --> 02:18:34.639 align:start position:0%
adhering to
 
02:18:39.549 --> 02:18:39.559 align:start position:0%
codes yes somewhat somewhat but sounds
 
02:18:41.150 --> 02:18:41.160 align:start position:0%
like we're getting more organized and
 
02:18:42.870 --> 02:18:42.880 align:start position:0%
that's a good
 
02:18:46.030 --> 02:18:46.040 align:start position:0%
thing any other questions I have just
 
02:18:47.349 --> 02:18:47.359 align:start position:0%
one for clarification if you could
 
02:18:49.709 --> 02:18:49.719 align:start position:0%
clarify something that was spoken before
 
02:18:51.790 --> 02:18:51.800 align:start position:0%
um if we were to pass this the governor
 
02:18:54.110 --> 02:18:54.120 align:start position:0%
was to sign it um ironically it would
 
02:18:55.750 --> 02:18:55.760 align:start position:0%
probably be about 60 days in between his
 
02:18:57.070 --> 02:18:57.080 align:start position:0%
signing and when it actually takes
 
02:19:01.349 --> 02:19:01.359 align:start position:0%
effect before um would this
 
02:19:04.669 --> 02:19:04.679 align:start position:0%
make that window that occurred before
 
02:19:07.190 --> 02:19:07.200 align:start position:0%
would it make those codes those uh
 
02:19:09.150 --> 02:19:09.160 align:start position:0%
Municipal codes obsolete would they have
 
02:19:11.469 --> 02:19:11.479 align:start position:0%
to change them anyway to meet the new
 
02:19:13.549 --> 02:19:13.559 align:start position:0%
code AS was stated
 
02:19:16.309 --> 02:19:16.319 align:start position:0%
earlier you have to look at two parts of
 
02:19:18.709 --> 02:19:18.719 align:start position:0%
this uh the permitting the fees the
 
02:19:20.709 --> 02:19:20.719 align:start position:0%
certificate of occupancy the board of
 
02:19:22.389 --> 02:19:22.399 align:start position:0%
appeals kind of stuff that's reserved
 
02:19:24.830 --> 02:19:24.840 align:start position:0%
for the locals probably not because
 
02:19:27.549 --> 02:19:27.559 align:start position:0%
those while they override some of the
 
02:19:29.110 --> 02:19:29.120 align:start position:0%
stuff that's in the model codes it's
 
02:19:31.110 --> 02:19:31.120 align:start position:0%
clearly reserved for the locals and and
 
02:19:32.790 --> 02:19:32.800 align:start position:0%
we don't have a lot of problems with
 
02:19:36.309 --> 02:19:36.319 align:start position:0%
that on the technical side uh an
 
02:19:39.150 --> 02:19:39.160 align:start position:0%
amendment is to a code almost by
 
02:19:41.389 --> 02:19:41.399 align:start position:0%
definition so once that code is no
 
02:19:43.349 --> 02:19:43.359 align:start position:0%
longer in effect you need a new
 
02:19:46.190 --> 02:19:46.200 align:start position:0%
amendment is that is that understood
 
02:19:48.509 --> 02:19:48.519 align:start position:0%
between the the localities and the state
 
02:19:50.230 --> 02:19:50.240 align:start position:0%
though that they would have to do that I
 
02:19:52.590 --> 02:19:52.600 align:start position:0%
can tell tell you that in my cursory
 
02:19:54.870 --> 02:19:54.880 align:start position:0%
review of a few websites have found
 
02:19:58.110 --> 02:19:58.120 align:start position:0%
major cities in the state where websites
 
02:20:00.469 --> 02:20:00.479 align:start position:0%
and presumably ordinances had not been
 
02:20:03.469 --> 02:20:03.479 align:start position:0%
adopt not been updated even to reflect
 
02:20:06.030 --> 02:20:06.040 align:start position:0%
the current State Building Code these
 
02:20:08.110 --> 02:20:08.120 align:start position:0%
things take on a lot of energy and then
 
02:20:09.990 --> 02:20:10.000 align:start position:0%
they go to sleep and people tend to
 
02:20:12.270 --> 02:20:12.280 align:start position:0%
forget about
 
02:20:15.110 --> 02:20:15.120 align:start position:0%
them so I guess my final question in
 
02:20:17.870 --> 02:20:17.880 align:start position:0%
that train of thought then is this would
 
02:20:20.389 --> 02:20:20.399 align:start position:0%
require any new amendments to come to
 
02:20:20.399 --> 02:20:21.630 align:start position:0%
require any new amendments to come to
you

02:20:21.630 --> 02:20:21.640 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:20:24.429 --> 02:20:24.439 align:start position:0%
does it State anything about updating
 
02:20:26.110 --> 02:20:26.120 align:start position:0%
old amendments and having those come to
 
02:20:32.910 --> 02:20:32.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:36.070 --> 02:20:36.080 align:start position:0%
renewed the the statute as it sits today
 
02:20:39.309 --> 02:20:39.319 align:start position:0%
requires new amendments to come to us
 
02:20:41.710 --> 02:20:41.720 align:start position:0%
that that's since January of
 
02:20:45.590 --> 02:20:45.600 align:start position:0%
23 um I'm having difficulty
 
02:20:47.070 --> 02:20:47.080 align:start position:0%
understanding an amendment that would
 
02:20:50.030 --> 02:20:50.040 align:start position:0%
carry from one addition of a code to the
 
02:20:52.469 --> 02:20:52.479 align:start position:0%
next because an amendment is an
 
02:20:55.230 --> 02:20:55.240 align:start position:0%
amendment to a version of a code right I
 
02:20:56.950 --> 02:20:56.960 align:start position:0%
I agree with you 100% on that I'm I'm
 
02:20:59.429 --> 02:20:59.439 align:start position:0%
saying do the localities know that do
 
02:21:01.070 --> 02:21:01.080 align:start position:0%
they know that it doesn't transfer so
 
02:21:03.309 --> 02:21:03.319 align:start position:0%
they make an amendment to the 2018 code
 
02:21:05.830 --> 02:21:05.840 align:start position:0%
and then we move to the 2021 does the
 
02:21:07.510 --> 02:21:07.520 align:start position:0%
locality know that their Amendment to
 
02:21:09.590 --> 02:21:09.600 align:start position:0%
the 2018 is now Obsolete and they'll
 
02:21:11.710 --> 02:21:11.720 align:start position:0%
have to update it you're used to this
 
02:21:12.710 --> 02:21:12.720 align:start position:0%
because you have to do it every couple
 
02:21:14.950 --> 02:21:14.960 align:start position:0%
of years municipalities may not be as
 
02:21:16.550 --> 02:21:16.560 align:start position:0%
familiar with the with the process do
 
02:21:18.070 --> 02:21:18.080 align:start position:0%
they know to do that and is there a way
 
02:21:20.030 --> 02:21:20.040 align:start position:0%
to hold them accountable to doing that
 
02:21:22.389 --> 02:21:22.399 align:start position:0%
the the build officials Association does
 
02:21:24.950 --> 02:21:24.960 align:start position:0%
a wonderful job at education for the
 
02:21:27.950 --> 02:21:27.960 align:start position:0%
people that are within their their view
 
02:21:31.309 --> 02:21:31.319 align:start position:0%
uh I can't say that everybody gets to
 
02:21:31.319 --> 02:21:32.309 align:start position:0%
uh I can't say that everybody gets to
that

02:21:32.309 --> 02:21:32.319 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:21:35.950 --> 02:21:35.960 align:start position:0%
education uh and I'm not really familiar
 
02:21:39.150 --> 02:21:39.160 align:start position:0%
with how towns become aware of New rsas
 
02:21:43.750 --> 02:21:43.760 align:start position:0%
U whether they read them or not okay
 
02:21:46.469 --> 02:21:46.479 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr shman thank you
 
02:21:46.479 --> 02:21:49.510 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr shman thank you
Sean

02:21:49.510 --> 02:21:49.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:49.520 --> 02:22:00.070 align:start position:0%
 
timy

02:22:00.070 --> 02:22:00.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:01.910 --> 02:22:01.920 align:start position:0%
morning again Sean tum many State Fire
 
02:22:03.070 --> 02:22:03.080 align:start position:0%
Marshal for the record I was trying to
 
02:22:04.790 --> 02:22:04.800 align:start position:0%
hide back there but the State Fire
 
02:22:06.349 --> 02:22:06.359 align:start position:0%
Marshall came up a few times so I should
 
02:22:09.150 --> 02:22:09.160 align:start position:0%
probably figured it should come up um
 
02:22:11.469 --> 02:22:11.479 align:start position:0%
quick so we have four communities that I
 
02:22:12.870 --> 02:22:12.880 align:start position:0%
just brought it up four communities that
 
02:22:14.590 --> 02:22:14.600 align:start position:0%
are currently listed Portsmouth
 
02:22:17.950 --> 02:22:17.960 align:start position:0%
Manchester Durham and Amherst um Port
 
02:22:20.190 --> 02:22:20.200 align:start position:0%
Smith adopted the fully adopted a later
 
02:22:22.309 --> 02:22:22.319 align:start position:0%
addition of the electrical code which
 
02:22:24.550 --> 02:22:24.560 align:start position:0%
has created some conflicts between our
 
02:22:26.230 --> 02:22:26.240 align:start position:0%
adopted currently adopted state
 
02:22:29.070 --> 02:22:29.080 align:start position:0%
electrical code and portsmiths which is
 
02:22:31.590 --> 02:22:31.600 align:start position:0%
um created some challenges for
 
02:22:34.030 --> 02:22:34.040 align:start position:0%
electricians um Durham as we know
 
02:22:35.550 --> 02:22:35.560 align:start position:0%
adopted the later addition of the energy
 
02:22:38.309 --> 02:22:38.319 align:start position:0%
code um Manchester in their building
 
02:22:41.030 --> 02:22:41.040 align:start position:0%
code uh it's mostly are some procedural
 
02:22:42.790 --> 02:22:42.800 align:start position:0%
stuff and like for the helping to
 
02:22:44.309 --> 02:22:44.319 align:start position:0%
identify what the snow load or the wind
 
02:22:46.190 --> 02:22:46.200 align:start position:0%
load or the seismic requirements are
 
02:22:48.150 --> 02:22:48.160 align:start position:0%
which I think is helpful information and
 
02:22:49.870 --> 02:22:49.880 align:start position:0%
that's what their Amendment largely does
 
02:22:53.030 --> 02:22:53.040 align:start position:0%
that those typ to things Amherst um just
 
02:22:54.790 --> 02:22:54.800 align:start position:0%
a quick review I'm not didn't go through
 
02:22:56.990 --> 02:22:57.000 align:start position:0%
the full documents but talks about some
 
02:22:59.230 --> 02:22:59.240 align:start position:0%
water well testing and PFA and P you
 
02:23:00.910 --> 02:23:00.920 align:start position:0%
know p and those types of things try to
 
02:23:05.710 --> 02:23:05.720 align:start position:0%
clarify so not huge types of items um
 
02:23:07.630 --> 02:23:07.640 align:start position:0%
I'm going to say in general the Fire
 
02:23:08.830 --> 02:23:08.840 align:start position:0%
Marshals office and Department of Safety
 
02:23:10.670 --> 02:23:10.680 align:start position:0%
is neutral on the bill I think it's uh
 
02:23:12.309 --> 02:23:12.319 align:start position:0%
you know it's up to the general court as
 
02:23:14.070 --> 02:23:14.080 align:start position:0%
how how we want to restrict local
 
02:23:17.469 --> 02:23:17.479 align:start position:0%
communities on the the scope of uh the
 
02:23:18.830 --> 02:23:18.840 align:start position:0%
what they can and cannot do with the
 
02:23:21.309 --> 02:23:21.319 align:start position:0%
codes um
 
02:23:23.070 --> 02:23:23.080 align:start position:0%
the you know I think we're really
 
02:23:24.550 --> 02:23:24.560 align:start position:0%
talking about two communities as we
 
02:23:25.910 --> 02:23:25.920 align:start position:0%
already talked about that have gone way
 
02:23:28.790 --> 02:23:28.800 align:start position:0%
above and beyond uh the the small
 
02:23:32.510 --> 02:23:32.520 align:start position:0%
changes I I think work well the my
 
02:23:33.990 --> 02:23:34.000 align:start position:0%
office where you've come up the
 
02:23:35.830 --> 02:23:35.840 align:start position:0%
questions come up in the past my office
 
02:23:37.389 --> 02:23:37.399 align:start position:0%
has been asked for the building code
 
02:23:38.510 --> 02:23:38.520 align:start position:0%
review board and the board of Fire
 
02:23:41.550 --> 02:23:41.560 align:start position:0%
Control to sort of catalog those so
 
02:23:43.670 --> 02:23:43.680 align:start position:0%
we're trying to create and the ask was
 
02:23:45.990 --> 02:23:46.000 align:start position:0%
from the general court create a One-Stop
 
02:23:47.870 --> 02:23:47.880 align:start position:0%
shop so anyone in the state whether
 
02:23:51.030 --> 02:23:51.040 align:start position:0%
you're a homeowner a developer or a
 
02:23:53.710 --> 02:23:53.720 align:start position:0%
design firm can find this is the state
 
02:23:55.590 --> 02:23:55.600 align:start position:0%
fire code these are the state amendments
 
02:23:57.230 --> 02:23:57.240 align:start position:0%
and oh by the way this is where I find
 
02:23:58.389 --> 02:23:58.399 align:start position:0%
the local amendments whether you're
 
02:23:59.870 --> 02:23:59.880 align:start position:0%
talking about the building code or fire
 
02:24:02.389 --> 02:24:02.399 align:start position:0%
code and we've been trying very hard
 
02:24:03.710 --> 02:24:03.720 align:start position:0%
over the last couple years to try to
 
02:24:05.830 --> 02:24:05.840 align:start position:0%
pull that together and frankly it's like
 
02:24:07.910 --> 02:24:07.920 align:start position:0%
a hide and seek game for us and I think
 
02:24:07.920 --> 02:24:09.630 align:start position:0%
a hide and seek game for us and I think
that

02:24:09.630 --> 02:24:09.640 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:24:12.870 --> 02:24:12.880 align:start position:0%
um I I think this uh statute or the
 
02:24:15.630 --> 02:24:15.640 align:start position:0%
proposed uh revision and Bill would help
 
02:24:17.710 --> 02:24:17.720 align:start position:0%
clean up some of that stuff and try to
 
02:24:19.389 --> 02:24:19.399 align:start position:0%
really achieve what we're after is try
 
02:24:21.389 --> 02:24:21.399 align:start position:0%
to help simplify process codes are
 
02:24:23.349 --> 02:24:23.359 align:start position:0%
difficult and it's anyways and if we can
 
02:24:26.070 --> 02:24:26.080 align:start position:0%
help make it easier for the end users um
 
02:24:28.309 --> 02:24:28.319 align:start position:0%
I think that's a win happy to be part of
 
02:24:30.150 --> 02:24:30.160 align:start position:0%
a conversation on subcommittee try to
 
02:24:31.469 --> 02:24:31.479 align:start position:0%
figure out how to navigate and make it
 
02:24:33.590 --> 02:24:33.600 align:start position:0%
better um but I think everyone that's
 
02:24:35.429 --> 02:24:35.439 align:start position:0%
sitting here today is is really trying
 
02:24:37.870 --> 02:24:37.880 align:start position:0%
to make it a little bit better um and
 
02:24:39.510 --> 02:24:39.520 align:start position:0%
the process a little bit smoother and
 
02:24:40.630 --> 02:24:40.640 align:start position:0%
that's what we've been trying to work
 
02:24:42.670 --> 02:24:42.680 align:start position:0%
for for I would say the last six years
 
02:24:45.110 --> 02:24:45.120 align:start position:0%
that I've been involved with um so happy
 
02:24:46.550 --> 02:24:46.560 align:start position:0%
to try to answer questions just want to
 
02:24:49.389 --> 02:24:49.399 align:start position:0%
try to help frame that a little bit so
 
02:24:51.110 --> 02:24:51.120 align:start position:0%
sorry one quick thing the enforcement
 
02:24:53.830 --> 02:24:53.840 align:start position:0%
side um probably every other week we get
 
02:24:55.389 --> 02:24:55.399 align:start position:0%
a phone call sometimes on the building
 
02:24:57.670 --> 02:24:57.680 align:start position:0%
code definitely on the fire code side of
 
02:24:59.830 --> 02:24:59.840 align:start position:0%
um a Fire official wanting that wanting
 
02:25:01.510 --> 02:25:01.520 align:start position:0%
to like I want to enforce something I
 
02:25:04.070 --> 02:25:04.080 align:start position:0%
want I want smoke alarms to be smoking
 
02:25:05.950 --> 02:25:05.960 align:start position:0%
carbon monoxide alarms and have no Rhyme
 
02:25:08.790 --> 02:25:08.800 align:start position:0%
or Reason to do that and they want to
 
02:25:10.349 --> 02:25:10.359 align:start position:0%
enforce that I think the enforcement
 
02:25:12.950 --> 02:25:12.960 align:start position:0%
side of you you can't enforce madeup
 
02:25:15.950 --> 02:25:15.960 align:start position:0%
stuff unless it's gone through the local
 
02:25:17.870 --> 02:25:17.880 align:start position:0%
process and then we just do a quick
 
02:25:19.510 --> 02:25:19.520 align:start position:0%
check to say is it conflicting with the
 
02:25:21.230 --> 02:25:21.240 align:start position:0%
State Fire Cod not and similarly on the
 
02:25:23.830 --> 02:25:23.840 align:start position:0%
building code side so um it's not trying
 
02:25:25.710 --> 02:25:25.720 align:start position:0%
to be a stronghold it's just like trying
 
02:25:27.910 --> 02:25:27.920 align:start position:0%
to I think trying to make it easier for
 
02:25:29.510 --> 02:25:29.520 align:start position:0%
the end user that's that's how I keep
 
02:25:31.550 --> 02:25:31.560 align:start position:0%
coming back to in my head so sorry I
 
02:25:34.790 --> 02:25:34.800 align:start position:0%
think I'm done fine thank you any
 
02:25:37.269 --> 02:25:37.279 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you Mr thank
 
02:25:39.950 --> 02:25:39.960 align:start position:0%
you Stephen B
 
02:25:39.960 --> 02:25:49.230 align:start position:0%
you Stephen B
Court

02:25:49.230 --> 02:25:49.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:51.070 --> 02:25:51.080 align:start position:0%
electricians morning Mr chairman and
 
02:25:52.469 --> 02:25:52.479 align:start position:0%
committee members my name is Steven
 
02:25:54.590 --> 02:25:54.600 align:start position:0%
rancot I'm uh a liced electrician in the
 
02:25:55.750 --> 02:25:55.760 align:start position:0%
state of of Hampshire and also here
 
02:25:57.230 --> 02:25:57.240 align:start position:0%
representing the ecba electrical
 
02:25:59.670 --> 02:25:59.680 align:start position:0%
contractors Business Association um let
 
02:26:00.990 --> 02:26:01.000 align:start position:0%
me start off if I could by saying that
 
02:26:02.389 --> 02:26:02.399 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of time and effort put
 
02:26:03.950 --> 02:26:03.960 align:start position:0%
into this bill to try to come up with
 
02:26:05.550 --> 02:26:05.560 align:start position:0%
the right wording with all the
 
02:26:07.349 --> 02:26:07.359 align:start position:0%
interested parties or most of them if
 
02:26:09.790 --> 02:26:09.800 align:start position:0%
possible we did we didn't just you know
 
02:26:11.349 --> 02:26:11.359 align:start position:0%
come up with it we tried to see how it
 
02:26:13.910 --> 02:26:13.920 align:start position:0%
affected it as Senator Carson um
 
02:26:16.070 --> 02:26:16.080 align:start position:0%
mentioned it cleans up the bill because
 
02:26:17.630 --> 02:26:17.640 align:start position:0%
it was mentioned what their Authority
 
02:26:19.469 --> 02:26:19.479 align:start position:0%
was in so many different spots through
 
02:26:21.469 --> 02:26:21.479 align:start position:0%
the rsas that there's always different
 
02:26:23.190 --> 02:26:23.200 align:start position:0%
interpretation this trying clarifies it
 
02:26:25.670 --> 02:26:25.680 align:start position:0%
and references to it to try to make it
 
02:26:25.680 --> 02:26:26.550 align:start position:0%
and references to it to try to make it
um

02:26:26.550 --> 02:26:26.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:26:30.990 --> 02:26:31.000 align:start position:0%
easier um the a lot of the towns as far
 
02:26:32.870 --> 02:26:32.880 align:start position:0%
as uh one of the questions that came up
 
02:26:34.910 --> 02:26:34.920 align:start position:0%
was the um how would the towns know
 
02:26:37.389 --> 02:26:37.399 align:start position:0%
about it in uh and talking to Bill
 
02:26:38.590 --> 02:26:38.600 align:start position:0%
mckenny he mentioned that the New
 
02:26:40.190 --> 02:26:40.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Municipal Association is
 
02:26:41.670 --> 02:26:41.680 align:start position:0%
usually where the municipalities get
 
02:26:42.950 --> 02:26:42.960 align:start position:0%
their information and that the New
 
02:26:44.030 --> 02:26:44.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire building officials would be
 
02:26:45.710 --> 02:26:45.720 align:start position:0%
glad to provide that updated information
 
02:26:47.710 --> 02:26:47.720 align:start position:0%
to them so they could get it so that's
 
02:26:48.990 --> 02:26:49.000 align:start position:0%
typically how they they get their
 
02:26:51.790 --> 02:26:51.800 align:start position:0%
information so um that just to answer
 
02:26:54.510 --> 02:26:54.520 align:start position:0%
that question the other one of the other
 
02:26:56.389 --> 02:26:56.399 align:start position:0%
issues was it talked about the date so
 
02:26:59.030 --> 02:26:59.040 align:start position:0%
it talks about July 1st 2024 I think on
 
02:27:00.990 --> 02:27:01.000 align:start position:0%
page two line
 
02:27:03.790 --> 02:27:03.800 align:start position:0%
27 and that was meant to try to give the
 
02:27:05.630 --> 02:27:05.640 align:start position:0%
fire marshal to get this on the website
 
02:27:08.389 --> 02:27:08.399 align:start position:0%
a reset like you said everybody even
 
02:27:09.510 --> 02:27:09.520 align:start position:0%
those who have submitted before they
 
02:27:10.630 --> 02:27:10.640 align:start position:0%
don't have to go through the legal
 
02:27:12.150 --> 02:27:12.160 align:start position:0%
process again they just have to resubmit
 
02:27:14.429 --> 02:27:14.439 align:start position:0%
it because it has to follow what's been
 
02:27:16.630 --> 02:27:16.640 align:start position:0%
an existing law I think that's probably
 
02:27:19.190 --> 02:27:19.200 align:start position:0%
the most important thing that this law
 
02:27:22.830 --> 02:27:22.840 align:start position:0%
exists already and we find is many or
 
02:27:24.870 --> 02:27:24.880 align:start position:0%
quite a few towns municipalities aren't
 
02:27:26.910 --> 02:27:26.920 align:start position:0%
aware of this we we had a meeting
 
02:27:29.269 --> 02:27:29.279 align:start position:0%
probably eight years ago back when a
 
02:27:30.950 --> 02:27:30.960 align:start position:0%
previous Fire Marshal everybody was
 
02:27:32.230 --> 02:27:32.240 align:start position:0%
there a big thing and it was brought to
 
02:27:34.150 --> 02:27:34.160 align:start position:0%
our attention by the legal councel from
 
02:27:36.510 --> 02:27:36.520 align:start position:0%
the municipalities that this is the
 
02:27:39.150 --> 02:27:39.160 align:start position:0%
process they're supposed to follow
 
02:27:41.510 --> 02:27:41.520 align:start position:0%
nobody really knew that so we're only
 
02:27:42.790 --> 02:27:42.800 align:start position:0%
trying to one make sure they're
 
02:27:44.389 --> 02:27:44.399 align:start position:0%
following the legal process a lot of
 
02:27:45.790 --> 02:27:45.800 align:start position:0%
them don't even know that they don't
 
02:27:47.510 --> 02:27:47.520 align:start position:0%
even know the legal process it has to go
 
02:27:48.950 --> 02:27:48.960 align:start position:0%
through a vote through the
 
02:27:53.550 --> 02:27:53.560 align:start position:0%
town like like any situation some you
 
02:27:54.550 --> 02:27:54.560 align:start position:0%
know there's
 
02:27:57.349 --> 02:27:57.359 align:start position:0%
no um there's no requirements for
 
02:27:59.389 --> 02:27:59.399 align:start position:0%
inspectors in town in states in the
 
02:28:01.190 --> 02:28:01.200 align:start position:0%
municipalities while many of them are
 
02:28:02.990 --> 02:28:03.000 align:start position:0%
qualified but there's a lot of them as
 
02:28:05.030 --> 02:28:05.040 align:start position:0%
you get to you know outskirts in the
 
02:28:06.510 --> 02:28:06.520 align:start position:0%
smaller towns and cities that it's you
 
02:28:08.269 --> 02:28:08.279 align:start position:0%
know they they have volunteer people
 
02:28:10.469 --> 02:28:10.479 align:start position:0%
help and and sometimes you know they'll
 
02:28:13.030 --> 02:28:13.040 align:start position:0%
take an put an amendment in or something
 
02:28:15.110 --> 02:28:15.120 align:start position:0%
they require because that's what they
 
02:28:17.429 --> 02:28:17.439 align:start position:0%
want and they don't follow the legal
 
02:28:19.550 --> 02:28:19.560 align:start position:0%
process to make it happen we're just
 
02:28:21.590 --> 02:28:21.600 align:start position:0%
asking the follow that we have to follow
 
02:28:23.309 --> 02:28:23.319 align:start position:0%
the law I would think you would want the
 
02:28:25.349 --> 02:28:25.359 align:start position:0%
municipalities to follow the law in
 
02:28:27.469 --> 02:28:27.479 align:start position:0%
putting these amendments forward they
 
02:28:29.910 --> 02:28:29.920 align:start position:0%
you know we've all heard of it I'm sure
 
02:28:32.429 --> 02:28:32.439 align:start position:0%
but I had one situation one town where I
 
02:28:34.150 --> 02:28:34.160 align:start position:0%
he required he asked me to do a certain
 
02:28:35.950 --> 02:28:35.960 align:start position:0%
thing for grounding I showed him the
 
02:28:38.550 --> 02:28:38.560 align:start position:0%
codebook where it said I did it proper I
 
02:28:40.670 --> 02:28:40.680 align:start position:0%
talked to the state inspector to NFPA
 
02:28:42.349 --> 02:28:42.359 align:start position:0%
representative and multiple people very
 
02:28:44.230 --> 02:28:44.240 align:start position:0%
high in the industry they all said I was
 
02:28:45.670 --> 02:28:45.680 align:start position:0%
correct and then he finally said well
 
02:28:48.030 --> 02:28:48.040 align:start position:0%
that's what I want that makes it very
 
02:28:50.670 --> 02:28:50.680 align:start position:0%
tough for us right I mean honestly it's
 
02:28:51.990 --> 02:28:52.000 align:start position:0%
just you know we just want like I said
 
02:28:53.269 --> 02:28:53.279 align:start position:0%
if it's on the website the State
 
02:28:55.349 --> 02:28:55.359 align:start position:0%
Building Code website and it's listed
 
02:28:57.030 --> 02:28:57.040 align:start position:0%
there and we go and we have to bid a job
 
02:28:59.150 --> 02:28:59.160 align:start position:0%
or do something we can say oh this town
 
02:29:01.389 --> 02:29:01.399 align:start position:0%
requires this okay this town requires
 
02:29:04.469 --> 02:29:04.479 align:start position:0%
this so it does make it easier it helps
 
02:29:07.750 --> 02:29:07.760 align:start position:0%
make it more efficient and just stops
 
02:29:10.590 --> 02:29:10.600 align:start position:0%
you know um it from being just what they
 
02:29:12.469 --> 02:29:12.479 align:start position:0%
may want in that particular town for no
 
02:29:14.269 --> 02:29:14.279 align:start position:0%
particular reason
 
02:29:16.750 --> 02:29:16.760 align:start position:0%
um the
 
02:29:19.269 --> 02:29:19.279 align:start position:0%
uh yeah so this is just requiring exist
 
02:29:20.790 --> 02:29:20.800 align:start position:0%
this is just clearing up that
 
02:29:22.990 --> 02:29:23.000 align:start position:0%
requirement that they have to do to put
 
02:29:24.990 --> 02:29:25.000 align:start position:0%
forth an amendment in the town itself
 
02:29:26.150 --> 02:29:26.160 align:start position:0%
and trying to give it some sort of
 
02:29:28.349 --> 02:29:28.359 align:start position:0%
oversight with some technical expertise
 
02:29:29.670 --> 02:29:29.680 align:start position:0%
at the state billing code board
 
02:29:30.950 --> 02:29:30.960 align:start position:0%
sometimes these inspectors might put
 
02:29:32.670 --> 02:29:32.680 align:start position:0%
them through or the billing officials in
 
02:29:34.670 --> 02:29:34.680 align:start position:0%
the town don't have anywhere near the
 
02:29:36.550 --> 02:29:36.560 align:start position:0%
amount of experience that the state
 
02:29:38.710 --> 02:29:38.720 align:start position:0%
billing code board has and it gives a
 
02:29:39.910 --> 02:29:39.920 align:start position:0%
look over to make sure it's not
 
02:29:43.230 --> 02:29:43.240 align:start position:0%
conflicting not less stringent than and
 
02:29:46.030 --> 02:29:46.040 align:start position:0%
then from there the confirmation process
 
02:29:47.950 --> 02:29:47.960 align:start position:0%
is if you're going to put in a code and
 
02:29:50.269 --> 02:29:50.279 align:start position:0%
you're going to say this is what I want
 
02:29:51.990 --> 02:29:52.000 align:start position:0%
and I have to do
 
02:29:55.469 --> 02:29:55.479 align:start position:0%
that everybody was concerned about um
 
02:29:57.990 --> 02:29:58.000 align:start position:0%
unless it's um confirmed shall not be
 
02:29:59.590 --> 02:29:59.600 align:start position:0%
enforced well that wording was put in
 
02:30:02.030 --> 02:30:02.040 align:start position:0%
there for just that example okay so this
 
02:30:03.510 --> 02:30:03.520 align:start position:0%
person decides that's what they want but
 
02:30:05.269 --> 02:30:05.279 align:start position:0%
they didn't go through the legal process
 
02:30:07.670 --> 02:30:07.680 align:start position:0%
so now I have to follow something that
 
02:30:09.590 --> 02:30:09.600 align:start position:0%
hasn't been done legally that would be
 
02:30:10.830 --> 02:30:10.840 align:start position:0%
like me saying well I think it should be
 
02:30:12.550 --> 02:30:12.560 align:start position:0%
85 miles an hour in the highway so I'm
 
02:30:14.389 --> 02:30:14.399 align:start position:0%
just going to go that speed you know I
 
02:30:16.389 --> 02:30:16.399 align:start position:0%
the law is there tells them the process
 
02:30:18.469 --> 02:30:18.479 align:start position:0%
to adopt it and if they haven't gone
 
02:30:21.309 --> 02:30:21.319 align:start position:0%
through that why should I have to follow
 
02:30:23.630 --> 02:30:23.640 align:start position:0%
their their requirement once they've
 
02:30:25.349 --> 02:30:25.359 align:start position:0%
gone through the legal process no
 
02:30:27.670 --> 02:30:27.680 align:start position:0%
problem so it's trying to clarify that
 
02:30:29.590 --> 02:30:29.600 align:start position:0%
as well
 
02:30:31.950 --> 02:30:31.960 align:start position:0%
um it it creates a Level Playing Field
 
02:30:35.150 --> 02:30:35.160 align:start position:0%
for everybody and it it makes it so that
 
02:30:37.429 --> 02:30:37.439 align:start position:0%
you know what town wants what when it's
 
02:30:41.269 --> 02:30:41.279 align:start position:0%
been adopted all these the what Senator
 
02:30:43.990 --> 02:30:44.000 align:start position:0%
um Carson spoke about was for years we
 
02:30:45.670 --> 02:30:45.680 align:start position:0%
went through and Tred to correct this
 
02:30:48.030 --> 02:30:48.040 align:start position:0%
issue and and make it something that was
 
02:30:50.630 --> 02:30:50.640 align:start position:0%
workable for everybody and we basically
 
02:30:51.870 --> 02:30:51.880 align:start position:0%
they were years behind with the
 
02:30:54.230 --> 02:30:54.240 align:start position:0%
insurance concern with on the codes and
 
02:30:55.510 --> 02:30:55.520 align:start position:0%
this brought it up to basically the
 
02:30:58.910 --> 02:30:58.920 align:start position:0%
codes try to stay one cycle behind now
 
02:31:00.070 --> 02:31:00.080 align:start position:0%
they're in the process of trying to
 
02:31:02.190 --> 02:31:02.200 align:start position:0%
adopt those other ones but that one
 
02:31:04.389 --> 02:31:04.399 align:start position:0%
cycle just for instance for us we had
 
02:31:05.990 --> 02:31:06.000 align:start position:0%
issues that came up and there were I
 
02:31:09.590 --> 02:31:09.600 align:start position:0%
think 14 um temporary amendments to like
 
02:31:10.910 --> 02:31:10.920 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts let's just say just to
 
02:31:12.790 --> 02:31:12.800 align:start position:0%
give an example for our electrical code
 
02:31:14.269 --> 02:31:14.279 align:start position:0%
because one of the things they required
 
02:31:15.710 --> 02:31:15.720 align:start position:0%
the manufacturers didn't even make they
 
02:31:17.630 --> 02:31:17.640 align:start position:0%
were having problems with split systems
 
02:31:19.630 --> 02:31:19.640 align:start position:0%
everywhere that required ground fall
 
02:31:21.870 --> 02:31:21.880 align:start position:0%
potenti protction anything 250 Volt or
 
02:31:24.070 --> 02:31:24.080 align:start position:0%
more and it was causing issues
 
02:31:25.750 --> 02:31:25.760 align:start position:0%
everywhere and they had to stop it so we
 
02:31:28.309 --> 02:31:28.319 align:start position:0%
kind of let them go through that problem
 
02:31:30.550 --> 02:31:30.560 align:start position:0%
by one cycle behind they fix those
 
02:31:32.630 --> 02:31:32.640 align:start position:0%
things because and then when we adopt
 
02:31:35.030 --> 02:31:35.040 align:start position:0%
the code that one cycle behind you know
 
02:31:36.630 --> 02:31:36.640 align:start position:0%
about the issues you're either able to
 
02:31:38.469 --> 02:31:38.479 align:start position:0%
address them or not or they've already
 
02:31:40.030 --> 02:31:40.040 align:start position:0%
taken care of them from the manufacturer
 
02:31:42.469 --> 02:31:42.479 align:start position:0%
standpoint so that one code cycle behind
 
02:31:44.550 --> 02:31:44.560 align:start position:0%
is very important to let that happen
 
02:31:47.790 --> 02:31:47.800 align:start position:0%
because a lot of times these codes in
 
02:31:49.349 --> 02:31:49.359 align:start position:0%
our situation manufacturers who go to
 
02:31:51.030 --> 02:31:51.040 align:start position:0%
the code make panels and they try to
 
02:31:52.309 --> 02:31:52.319 align:start position:0%
that's how they sell product right we're
 
02:31:53.870 --> 02:31:53.880 align:start position:0%
going to we're going to make you acquire
 
02:31:56.349 --> 02:31:56.359 align:start position:0%
Arc faults or ground faults or you know
 
02:31:59.269 --> 02:31:59.279 align:start position:0%
T you know tamperproof Outlet so this
 
02:32:00.790 --> 02:32:00.800 align:start position:0%
just helps to let those work themselves
 
02:32:03.070 --> 02:32:03.080 align:start position:0%
out if there's no process and stay that
 
02:32:05.230 --> 02:32:05.240 align:start position:0%
one cycle behind so I hope that the
 
02:32:06.469 --> 02:32:06.479 align:start position:0%
committee would vote in favor of this
 
02:32:07.670 --> 02:32:07.680 align:start position:0%
there was a lot of time and effort put
 
02:32:08.950 --> 02:32:08.960 align:start position:0%
into it try to make the wording we can
 
02:32:09.990 --> 02:32:10.000 align:start position:0%
definitely make sure that it doesn't
 
02:32:12.190 --> 02:32:12.200 align:start position:0%
cause an issue with Shell Con form but
 
02:32:14.269 --> 02:32:14.279 align:start position:0%
that Shell Con form is just saying hey
 
02:32:15.670 --> 02:32:15.680 align:start position:0%
if you didn't follow the process then
 
02:32:17.110 --> 02:32:17.120 align:start position:0%
you shouldn't be able to enforce it I
 
02:32:18.710 --> 02:32:18.720 align:start position:0%
would think that the entire committee
 
02:32:20.110 --> 02:32:20.120 align:start position:0%
agrees if you don't follow the law you
 
02:32:21.830 --> 02:32:21.840 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be able to make somebody do
 
02:32:23.670 --> 02:32:23.680 align:start position:0%
something so that's where that comes
 
02:32:25.349 --> 02:32:25.359 align:start position:0%
from and I'll take any questions if need
 
02:32:26.790 --> 02:32:26.800 align:start position:0%
thank you for your time thank you for
 
02:32:27.990 --> 02:32:28.000 align:start position:0%
your testimony any
 
02:32:31.070 --> 02:32:31.080 align:start position:0%
questions representa Gart thank you
 
02:32:33.110 --> 02:32:33.120 align:start position:0%
chairman very quickly is there any
 
02:32:34.750 --> 02:32:34.760 align:start position:0%
liability for a building inspector that
 
02:32:36.230 --> 02:32:36.240 align:start position:0%
goes off the reservation and starts
 
02:32:38.910 --> 02:32:38.920 align:start position:0%
making up things you can go through the
 
02:32:41.150 --> 02:32:41.160 align:start position:0%
legal process which is very expensive to
 
02:32:42.830 --> 02:32:42.840 align:start position:0%
show that you didn't have to follow that
 
02:32:46.429 --> 02:32:46.439 align:start position:0%
but I mean but it's not yeah it's not
 
02:32:49.070 --> 02:32:49.080 align:start position:0%
easily this gives you that kind of some
 
02:32:50.429 --> 02:32:50.439 align:start position:0%
sort of
 
02:32:52.670 --> 02:32:52.680 align:start position:0%
Statewide you know process to make sure
 
02:32:54.830 --> 02:32:54.840 align:start position:0%
that for us if we go to the town too not
 
02:32:57.309 --> 02:32:57.319 align:start position:0%
to we can I can go to a town and they
 
02:32:58.790 --> 02:32:58.800 align:start position:0%
say hey I want this I just go on to the
 
02:33:01.309 --> 02:33:01.319 align:start position:0%
website I look it up on on the bi Marsh
 
02:33:02.910 --> 02:33:02.920 align:start position:0%
website and I can see if they posted
 
02:33:04.630 --> 02:33:04.640 align:start position:0%
their Amendment so it tells me when I'm
 
02:33:06.230 --> 02:33:06.240 align:start position:0%
getting a permit if this town has
 
02:33:07.710 --> 02:33:07.720 align:start position:0%
actually followed the process if it's
 
02:33:10.110 --> 02:33:10.120 align:start position:0%
not there then at least I know I have a
 
02:33:11.469 --> 02:33:11.479 align:start position:0%
I can have a discussion with them about
 
02:33:11.479 --> 02:33:12.790 align:start position:0%
I can have a discussion with them about
it

02:33:12.790 --> 02:33:12.800 align:start position:0%
it
 
02:33:15.429 --> 02:33:15.439 align:start position:0%
thank any other questions seeing none
 
02:33:17.070 --> 02:33:17.080 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your testimony
 
02:33:18.389 --> 02:33:18.399 align:start position:0%
is there anybody else who wishes to
 
02:33:22.230 --> 02:33:22.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:23.630 --> 02:33:23.640 align:start position:0%
the chair gave me the gavel for two
 
02:33:26.190 --> 02:33:26.200 align:start position:0%
bills and we're 16 minutes behind seeing
 
02:33:28.269 --> 02:33:28.279 align:start position:0%
none I will close the public hearing and
 
02:33:29.590 --> 02:33:29.600 align:start position:0%
hand the gavel
 
02:33:33.070 --> 02:33:33.080 align:start position:0%
off all right thank you I'm opening the
 
02:33:36.750 --> 02:33:36.760 align:start position:0%
public hearing on Senate Bill 367 and I
 
02:33:48.710 --> 02:33:48.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:48.720 --> 02:33:59.389 align:start position:0%
 
bson

02:33:59.389 --> 02:33:59.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:59.399 --> 02:34:01.349 align:start position:0%
 
good

02:34:01.349 --> 02:34:01.359 align:start position:0%
good
 
02:34:04.309 --> 02:34:04.319 align:start position:0%
morning uh for the record my name is
 
02:34:06.510 --> 02:34:06.520 align:start position:0%
Regina berzel I'm the state senator for
 
02:34:09.269 --> 02:34:09.279 align:start position:0%
district 19 which encompasses the towns
 
02:34:13.070 --> 02:34:13.080 align:start position:0%
of um Dairy Hamstead and Windham and I'm
 
02:34:17.230 --> 02:34:17.240 align:start position:0%
here as the prime sponsor of Senate Bill
 
02:34:20.990 --> 02:34:21.000 align:start position:0%
367 um Senate Bill 367 is a continuation
 
02:34:24.030 --> 02:34:24.040 align:start position:0%
of the um PTSD commission that we've
 
02:34:26.349 --> 02:34:26.359 align:start position:0%
that I've been chairing for probably the
 
02:34:29.590 --> 02:34:29.600 align:start position:0%
last um four maybe five years if not
 
02:34:32.429 --> 02:34:32.439 align:start position:0%
more longer than that um we've had some
 
02:34:35.670 --> 02:34:35.680 align:start position:0%
pretty recent uh accomplishments um as
 
02:34:39.269 --> 02:34:39.279 align:start position:0%
we put a subcommittee together to um put
 
02:34:41.429 --> 02:34:41.439 align:start position:0%
some to start in looking at some
 
02:34:43.110 --> 02:34:43.120 align:start position:0%
standards for what we call the Comfort
 
02:34:45.269 --> 02:34:45.279 align:start position:0%
dogs you I'm sure you're aware of
 
02:34:48.830 --> 02:34:48.840 align:start position:0%
Liberty from conquered and um Patches
 
02:34:50.550 --> 02:34:50.560 align:start position:0%
from Manchester
 
02:34:53.750 --> 02:34:53.760 align:start position:0%
um apparently there's a um there is no
 
02:34:56.110 --> 02:34:56.120 align:start position:0%
standard in nowhere in um the United
 
02:34:57.389 --> 02:34:57.399 align:start position:0%
States do they have a standard for
 
02:34:59.910 --> 02:34:59.920 align:start position:0%
Comfort dogs um and New Hampshire is
 
02:35:01.950 --> 02:35:01.960 align:start position:0%
looking to be one of the first ones
 
02:35:04.389 --> 02:35:04.399 align:start position:0%
we've brought on uh on the subcommittee
 
02:35:08.110 --> 02:35:08.120 align:start position:0%
is the owner of hero pups uh Laura
 
02:35:11.550 --> 02:35:11.560 align:start position:0%
Barker um and the Manchester police
 
02:35:14.030 --> 02:35:14.040 align:start position:0%
department and Laura Barker she
 
02:35:16.269 --> 02:35:16.279 align:start position:0%
typically um she does all the training
 
02:35:18.230 --> 02:35:18.240 align:start position:0%
and the breeding of the dogs that some
 
02:35:20.910 --> 02:35:20.920 align:start position:0%
of these Comfort dogs are used so um
 
02:35:23.670 --> 02:35:23.680 align:start position:0%
we're trying to get um some standards
 
02:35:25.309 --> 02:35:25.319 align:start position:0%
put together so they're not confused
 
02:35:27.070 --> 02:35:27.080 align:start position:0%
with some of the Comfort dogs the
 
02:35:29.429 --> 02:35:29.439 align:start position:0%
general Comfort dogs that people use on
 
02:35:34.389 --> 02:35:34.399 align:start position:0%
on um planes and and things such as that
 
02:35:36.630 --> 02:35:36.640 align:start position:0%
um we also put in uh training a
 
02:35:39.190 --> 02:35:39.200 align:start position:0%
requirement for training on PTSD for our
 
02:35:42.070 --> 02:35:42.080 align:start position:0%
First Responders which include the um
 
02:35:45.309 --> 02:35:45.319 align:start position:0%
which would include new hires um and
 
02:35:48.750 --> 02:35:48.760 align:start position:0%
continuing uh education during their uh
 
02:35:51.389 --> 02:35:51.399 align:start position:0%
during the lifetime of their career and
 
02:35:54.550 --> 02:35:54.560 align:start position:0%
also at retirement and after retirement
 
02:35:58.790 --> 02:35:58.800 align:start position:0%
because a lot of uh lot what we find um
 
02:36:00.309 --> 02:36:00.319 align:start position:0%
during that commission we found that a
 
02:36:03.030 --> 02:36:03.040 align:start position:0%
lot of the First Responders after they
 
02:36:07.230 --> 02:36:07.240 align:start position:0%
retire is where PTSD really kind of kick
 
02:36:09.269 --> 02:36:09.279 align:start position:0%
sometimes kicks in and that's where a
 
02:36:12.630 --> 02:36:12.640 align:start position:0%
lot of the suicides happen so um we put
 
02:36:14.830 --> 02:36:14.840 align:start position:0%
that some of the earlier accomplishments
 
02:36:17.590 --> 02:36:17.600 align:start position:0%
we've done is we put in a presumption
 
02:36:23.030 --> 02:36:23.040 align:start position:0%
for PTSD uh we also uh put in uh author
 
02:36:25.950 --> 02:36:25.960 align:start position:0%
we as put in a bill to allow life
 
02:36:27.830 --> 02:36:27.840 align:start position:0%
insurance for families of First
 
02:36:30.469 --> 02:36:30.479 align:start position:0%
Responders who do commit
 
02:36:32.630 --> 02:36:32.640 align:start position:0%
suicide and also the commission has
 
02:36:34.750 --> 02:36:34.760 align:start position:0%
brought to light some seminars on mental
 
02:36:36.590 --> 02:36:36.600 align:start position:0%
health and
 
02:36:39.110 --> 02:36:39.120 align:start position:0%
resiliency excuse me to help change the
 
02:36:42.190 --> 02:36:42.200 align:start position:0%
culture of leadership because we what we
 
02:36:44.190 --> 02:36:44.200 align:start position:0%
what when we first started
 
02:36:47.590 --> 02:36:47.600 align:start position:0%
the um the commission we found that
 
02:36:50.110 --> 02:36:50.120 align:start position:0%
there were some uh standard that
 
02:36:53.670 --> 02:36:53.680 align:start position:0%
leadership wasn't um paying attention to
 
02:36:57.670 --> 02:36:57.680 align:start position:0%
uh the results of PTSD in their in their
 
02:37:01.750 --> 02:37:01.760 align:start position:0%
um in their employees so the commission
 
02:37:03.630 --> 02:37:03.640 align:start position:0%
has put to brought to light some of
 
02:37:06.429 --> 02:37:06.439 align:start position:0%
these issues and um there are some
 
02:37:09.030 --> 02:37:09.040 align:start position:0%
Mental Health Providers along with um
 
02:37:11.349 --> 02:37:11.359 align:start position:0%
the firefighters have put together these
 
02:37:14.150 --> 02:37:14.160 align:start position:0%
seminars which bring the leadership of
 
02:37:15.990 --> 02:37:16.000 align:start position:0%
our First Responders
 
02:37:19.710 --> 02:37:19.720 align:start position:0%
into um train them train them to see
 
02:37:24.950 --> 02:37:24.960 align:start position:0%
some of the um PTSD signs
 
02:37:28.950 --> 02:37:28.960 align:start position:0%
um our Target for this next commission
 
02:37:32.630 --> 02:37:32.640 align:start position:0%
um as you can see in the duties um we
 
02:37:34.030 --> 02:37:34.040 align:start position:0%
want to put some options for
 
02:37:36.110 --> 02:37:36.120 align:start position:0%
streamlining workers compensation
 
02:37:37.429 --> 02:37:37.439 align:start position:0%
process in order to avoid
 
02:37:40.030 --> 02:37:40.040 align:start position:0%
retraumatization of First Responders
 
02:37:42.710 --> 02:37:42.720 align:start position:0%
with PTSD so what happens is a lot of
 
02:37:44.830 --> 02:37:44.840 align:start position:0%
times when a first responder goes into
 
02:37:48.030 --> 02:37:48.040 align:start position:0%
to try and
 
02:37:52.910 --> 02:37:52.920 align:start position:0%
um claim workers comp claim for a uh
 
02:37:57.590 --> 02:37:57.600 align:start position:0%
PTSD um episode uh what happens is we
 
02:38:01.190 --> 02:38:01.200 align:start position:0%
found that they are made to interview
 
02:38:03.990 --> 02:38:04.000 align:start position:0%
numerous times throughout the
 
02:38:08.230 --> 02:38:08.240 align:start position:0%
process um thereby compounding the issue
 
02:38:10.230 --> 02:38:10.240 align:start position:0%
so what we're going to be looking at is
 
02:38:15.230 --> 02:38:15.240 align:start position:0%
trying to allow them to testify once in
 
02:38:18.150 --> 02:38:18.160 align:start position:0%
front of a number of people um so that
 
02:38:21.150 --> 02:38:21.160 align:start position:0%
they can um um so they won't be
 
02:38:23.790 --> 02:38:23.800 align:start position:0%
continually having to tell their story
 
02:38:27.070 --> 02:38:27.080 align:start position:0%
on a consistent basis um we're
 
02:38:30.510 --> 02:38:30.520 align:start position:0%
also I my plan is within the next two
 
02:38:33.269 --> 02:38:33.279 align:start position:0%
years is to make sure that we do have um
 
02:38:35.910 --> 02:38:35.920 align:start position:0%
comfort dog standards the the commiss
 
02:38:38.190 --> 02:38:38.200 align:start position:0%
the committee is uh hopefully doing
 
02:38:40.030 --> 02:38:40.040 align:start position:0%
their work now within the next two years
 
02:38:41.590 --> 02:38:41.600 align:start position:0%
we should have some standards or within
 
02:38:43.070 --> 02:38:43.080 align:start position:0%
the next year I'm hoping to have some
 
02:38:46.469 --> 02:38:46.479 align:start position:0%
standards on these Comfort dogs um in
 
02:38:48.190 --> 02:38:48.200 align:start position:0%
addition the other thing we want to
 
02:38:50.110 --> 02:38:50.120 align:start position:0%
study is
 
02:38:53.389 --> 02:38:53.399 align:start position:0%
um one thing we found when we were in
 
02:38:55.150 --> 02:38:55.160 align:start position:0%
the commission there's a lot there's not
 
02:38:58.830 --> 02:38:58.840 align:start position:0%
a lot of data on how many suicides um
 
02:39:01.510 --> 02:39:01.520 align:start position:0%
are First Responders and one of the one
 
02:39:06.110 --> 02:39:06.120 align:start position:0%
of the black holes is when when you're
 
02:39:08.070 --> 02:39:08.080 align:start position:0%
we did find that Funeral Directors
 
02:39:09.429 --> 02:39:09.439 align:start position:0%
actually do have a lot of the
 
02:39:12.510 --> 02:39:12.520 align:start position:0%
information but what they don't have is
 
02:39:14.950 --> 02:39:14.960 align:start position:0%
information from let's say First
 
02:39:18.710 --> 02:39:18.720 align:start position:0%
Responders um part-time volunteers so we
 
02:39:21.429 --> 02:39:21.439 align:start position:0%
don't have a lot of data on Vol um the
 
02:39:25.429 --> 02:39:25.439 align:start position:0%
volunteer and part- timers so uh we've
 
02:39:27.550 --> 02:39:27.560 align:start position:0%
talked with the funeral directors we
 
02:39:29.110 --> 02:39:29.120 align:start position:0%
want to start looking into that and find
 
02:39:30.950 --> 02:39:30.960 align:start position:0%
out what we need to do to allow the
 
02:39:34.590 --> 02:39:34.600 align:start position:0%
funeral directors to start um tracking
 
02:39:37.550 --> 02:39:37.560 align:start position:0%
that information so we have better data
 
02:39:40.870 --> 02:39:40.880 align:start position:0%
um as far as the PTSD committed uh
 
02:39:43.429 --> 02:39:43.439 align:start position:0%
suicides so with that I'll try and
 
02:39:45.230 --> 02:39:45.240 align:start position:0%
entertain any questions I know there's a
 
02:39:46.550 --> 02:39:46.560 align:start position:0%
number of people that would like to
 
02:39:49.389 --> 02:39:49.399 align:start position:0%
speak as well yes I have a a question
 
02:39:51.750 --> 02:39:51.760 align:start position:0%
question you said that you have you
 
02:39:54.910 --> 02:39:54.920 align:start position:0%
instituted PTSD training for First
 
02:39:57.590 --> 02:39:57.600 align:start position:0%
Responders how did you how did you do
 
02:40:00.830 --> 02:40:00.840 align:start position:0%
that in rules no we actually put bills
 
02:40:04.750 --> 02:40:04.760 align:start position:0%
in okay so so you are submitting putting
 
02:40:08.750 --> 02:40:08.760 align:start position:0%
most of this into statute yep thank
 
02:40:13.910 --> 02:40:13.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:17.429 --> 02:40:17.439 align:start position:0%
Shu thank you madam chair um good
 
02:40:19.990 --> 02:40:20.000 align:start position:0%
morning Senator thank you for taking my
 
02:40:22.950 --> 02:40:22.960 align:start position:0%
question you mentioned uh the importance
 
02:40:26.990 --> 02:40:27.000 align:start position:0%
of data um but in the commission's
 
02:40:30.030 --> 02:40:30.040 align:start position:0%
duties I don't see a reference to
 
02:40:33.590 --> 02:40:33.600 align:start position:0%
collecting data would would you
 
02:40:35.760 --> 02:40:35.770 align:start position:0%
uh that would
 
02:40:35.770 --> 02:40:39.269 align:start position:0%
uh that would
[Music]

02:40:39.269 --> 02:40:39.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:44.550 --> 02:40:44.560 align:start position:0%
um so number three on page two um under
 
02:40:46.630 --> 02:40:46.640 align:start position:0%
Roman numeral 2 the addition of
 
02:40:48.670 --> 02:40:48.680 align:start position:0%
part-time volunteer first responder to a
 
02:40:50.550 --> 02:40:50.560 align:start position:0%
funeral director death certificate drop
 
02:40:53.110 --> 02:40:53.120 align:start position:0%
down menu that's part of where we're um
 
02:40:54.429 --> 02:40:54.439 align:start position:0%
trying to find the
 
02:40:57.710 --> 02:40:57.720 align:start position:0%
data okay so you're you would recommend
 
02:41:00.990 --> 02:41:01.000 align:start position:0%
getting data from other sources not uh
 
02:41:02.950 --> 02:41:02.960 align:start position:0%
the state creating
 
02:41:05.830 --> 02:41:05.840 align:start position:0%
data well no what what we're looking to
 
02:41:07.950 --> 02:41:07.960 align:start position:0%
do is find out what we need to do
 
02:41:09.830 --> 02:41:09.840 align:start position:0%
because what the funeral directors we're
 
02:41:11.630 --> 02:41:11.640 align:start position:0%
really directing at the funeral
 
02:41:14.469 --> 02:41:14.479 align:start position:0%
directors um because what they do is
 
02:41:16.750 --> 02:41:16.760 align:start position:0%
typically they have a drop- down menu
 
02:41:20.349 --> 02:41:20.359 align:start position:0%
and um they can choose whether it's a
 
02:41:22.710 --> 02:41:22.720 align:start position:0%
firefighter uh but they don't have the
 
02:41:25.429 --> 02:41:25.439 align:start position:0%
different a full-time part-time
 
02:41:29.030 --> 02:41:29.040 align:start position:0%
volunteer so we want us look into how we
 
02:41:31.309 --> 02:41:31.319 align:start position:0%
go go ahead and have I think it comes
 
02:41:32.269 --> 02:41:32.279 align:start position:0%
from the
 
02:41:34.710 --> 02:41:34.720 align:start position:0%
archives um the Secretary of State's
 
02:41:37.790 --> 02:41:37.800 align:start position:0%
office so we want to figure out how we
 
02:41:40.510 --> 02:41:40.520 align:start position:0%
can get that information into the
 
02:41:42.590 --> 02:41:42.600 align:start position:0%
funeral director's drop down menu so
 
02:41:45.070 --> 02:41:45.080 align:start position:0%
that they can start targeting that and
 
02:41:46.950 --> 02:41:46.960 align:start position:0%
that'll generate a question from the
 
02:41:50.469 --> 02:41:50.479 align:start position:0%
funeral director to the family um was
 
02:41:55.309 --> 02:41:55.319 align:start position:0%
your um loved one uh first responder um
 
02:42:00.190 --> 02:42:00.200 align:start position:0%
if he was was he or she was she a um uh
 
02:42:03.190 --> 02:42:03.200 align:start position:0%
part-time full-time volunteer so we can
 
02:42:05.750 --> 02:42:05.760 align:start position:0%
start extrapolating some of that data
 
02:42:08.070 --> 02:42:08.080 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Gart and then
 
02:42:09.990 --> 02:42:10.000 align:start position:0%
representative goalie thank you madam
 
02:42:12.990 --> 02:42:13.000 align:start position:0%
chair as far as standards go for the
 
02:42:15.630 --> 02:42:15.640 align:start position:0%
comfort dogs is there has there been an
 
02:42:18.190 --> 02:42:18.200 align:start position:0%
issue of them not comforting correct I'm
 
02:42:20.389 --> 02:42:20.399 align:start position:0%
a little confused as to what the the
 
02:42:21.630 --> 02:42:21.640 align:start position:0%
problem would be why would you need a
 
02:42:24.389 --> 02:42:24.399 align:start position:0%
standard for for those dogs because
 
02:42:29.030 --> 02:42:29.040 align:start position:0%
these are Public public owned um dogs
 
02:42:31.469 --> 02:42:31.479 align:start position:0%
basically and a lot of times what
 
02:42:32.870 --> 02:42:32.880 align:start position:0%
happens is they get
 
02:42:35.269 --> 02:42:35.279 align:start position:0%
confused the these Comfort dogs get
 
02:42:38.190 --> 02:42:38.200 align:start position:0%
confused and are have a lot more
 
02:42:41.190 --> 02:42:41.200 align:start position:0%
training than let's say a dog that would
 
02:42:43.870 --> 02:42:43.880 align:start position:0%
a comfort dog that would um company you
 
02:42:47.429 --> 02:42:47.439 align:start position:0%
want a on a plane so we want to make
 
02:42:50.150 --> 02:42:50.160 align:start position:0%
sure that even if we're the first ones
 
02:42:52.550 --> 02:42:52.560 align:start position:0%
in the US to be because a lot of states
 
02:42:55.790 --> 02:42:55.800 align:start position:0%
have comfort dogs but there are no there
 
02:42:58.710 --> 02:42:58.720 align:start position:0%
are no um
 
02:43:02.190 --> 02:43:02.200 align:start position:0%
regulations um and standards and we want
 
02:43:04.230 --> 02:43:04.240 align:start position:0%
to be one of the first ones to do that
 
02:43:06.870 --> 02:43:06.880 align:start position:0%
but they go through rigorous training
 
02:43:09.070 --> 02:43:09.080 align:start position:0%
where a lot of the other dogs do not so
 
02:43:10.870 --> 02:43:10.880 align:start position:0%
we want to make sure that if you're
 
02:43:13.469 --> 02:43:13.479 align:start position:0%
considered a public Comfort dog you have
 
02:43:14.790 --> 02:43:14.800 align:start position:0%
the right
 
02:43:17.830 --> 02:43:17.840 align:start position:0%
training okay thank you
 
02:43:19.790 --> 02:43:19.800 align:start position:0%
goie thank you thank Madam chair and
 
02:43:21.429 --> 02:43:21.439 align:start position:0%
thank you senator for uh the work you're
 
02:43:24.110 --> 02:43:24.120 align:start position:0%
doing on this commission and uh the
 
02:43:25.309 --> 02:43:25.319 align:start position:0%
commitment you're putting forward with
 
02:43:28.190 --> 02:43:28.200 align:start position:0%
it um just a quick question on I see
 
02:43:30.469 --> 02:43:30.479 align:start position:0%
there's a large group of individuals
 
02:43:32.110 --> 02:43:32.120 align:start position:0%
listed to this are they all
 
02:43:34.630 --> 02:43:34.640 align:start position:0%
participating at this time with we have
 
02:43:37.790 --> 02:43:37.800 align:start position:0%
had a really good um it's a kind of a
 
02:43:39.510 --> 02:43:39.520 align:start position:0%
well-oiled machine because we've been
 
02:43:41.550 --> 02:43:41.560 align:start position:0%
working together for for a number of
 
02:43:43.710 --> 02:43:43.720 align:start position:0%
years and there's a lot of knowledge on
 
02:43:46.469 --> 02:43:46.479 align:start position:0%
it so yeah they typically everyone shows
 
02:43:50.510 --> 02:43:50.520 align:start position:0%
up thank you okay thank
 
02:43:55.269 --> 02:43:55.279 align:start position:0%
you represent lus thank you so um is the
 
02:43:57.070 --> 02:43:57.080 align:start position:0%
existing commission going away or is
 
02:43:59.190 --> 02:43:59.200 align:start position:0%
this intended to change something about
 
02:44:03.630 --> 02:44:03.640 align:start position:0%
the current one or well the by law we
 
02:44:06.110 --> 02:44:06.120 align:start position:0%
only extended out for two years we're
 
02:44:09.309 --> 02:44:09.319 align:start position:0%
now kind of um in limbo we're waiting
 
02:44:10.870 --> 02:44:10.880 align:start position:0%
for this one to be extended so we can
 
02:44:13.950 --> 02:44:13.960 align:start position:0%
all get back together again thank
 
02:44:18.150 --> 02:44:18.160 align:start position:0%
you okay Simon thank you mam chair
 
02:44:19.710 --> 02:44:19.720 align:start position:0%
Senator thank you for taking question
 
02:44:21.230 --> 02:44:21.240 align:start position:0%
just for clarification so has the
 
02:44:23.349 --> 02:44:23.359 align:start position:0%
commission lapsed like has there been a
 
02:44:25.269 --> 02:44:25.279 align:start position:0%
twoyear gap or just like a short Gap in
 
02:44:26.910 --> 02:44:26.920 align:start position:0%
between you finished up your first set
 
02:44:28.389 --> 02:44:28.399 align:start position:0%
of work and now you want to start up in
 
02:44:30.750 --> 02:44:30.760 align:start position:0%
your next one I believe when our final
 
02:44:33.429 --> 02:44:33.439 align:start position:0%
report was due in November that um I
 
02:44:35.750 --> 02:44:35.760 align:start position:0%
think October was our last meeting Okay
 
02:44:37.790 --> 02:44:37.800 align:start position:0%
so we've we've we've had to lapse
 
02:44:39.830 --> 02:44:39.840 align:start position:0%
because we had no authorization to meet

02:45:00.389 --> 02:45:00.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:04.550 --> 02:45:04.560 align:start position:0%
representative Mark PR Hillsboro 15 uh
 
02:45:06.110 --> 02:45:06.120 align:start position:0%
thank you for letting me speak I'll make
 
02:45:09.950 --> 02:45:09.960 align:start position:0%
it quick um I was on the commission uh
 
02:45:12.469 --> 02:45:12.479 align:start position:0%
years ago then I didn't run one term
 
02:45:15.429 --> 02:45:15.439 align:start position:0%
last term um but I did actually go to
 
02:45:17.190 --> 02:45:17.200 align:start position:0%
the commission meetings because I felt
 
02:45:19.670 --> 02:45:19.680 align:start position:0%
it was very important I've been involved
 
02:45:21.910 --> 02:45:21.920 align:start position:0%
in critical instance Stress Management
 
02:45:23.670 --> 02:45:23.680 align:start position:0%
which is pretty much the prevention of
 
02:45:26.230 --> 02:45:26.240 align:start position:0%
PTSD or trying to do that with a team
 
02:45:29.990 --> 02:45:30.000 align:start position:0%
state run team uh and I know this
 
02:45:33.630 --> 02:45:33.640 align:start position:0%
commission has up the standard for the
 
02:45:38.830 --> 02:45:38.840 align:start position:0%
teams in the state um and to the uh
 
02:45:41.750 --> 02:45:41.760 align:start position:0%
Comfort dog there is specific training
 
02:45:44.670 --> 02:45:44.680 align:start position:0%
for the dogs that work with Public
 
02:45:46.830 --> 02:45:46.840 align:start position:0%
Safety and we want to make sure they
 
02:45:48.190 --> 02:45:48.200 align:start position:0%
meet that requirement when they're
 
02:45:49.550 --> 02:45:49.560 align:start position:0%
working with us
 
02:45:49.560 --> 02:45:51.190 align:start position:0%
working with us
so

02:45:51.190 --> 02:45:51.200 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:45:53.550 --> 02:45:53.560 align:start position:0%
um gathering
 
02:45:55.790 --> 02:45:55.800 align:start position:0%
information putting it out doing
 
02:45:57.790 --> 02:45:57.800 align:start position:0%
training for First Responders first time
 
02:45:59.990 --> 02:46:00.000 align:start position:0%
ever became mandatory for firefighters
 
02:46:02.389 --> 02:46:02.399 align:start position:0%
that they actually had to sit and watch
 
02:46:04.830 --> 02:46:04.840 align:start position:0%
the the training right and get signed
 
02:46:06.790 --> 02:46:06.800 align:start position:0%
off so
 
02:46:09.550 --> 02:46:09.560 align:start position:0%
awareness is a big part of what we all
 
02:46:13.710 --> 02:46:13.720 align:start position:0%
do um so I I do believe this commission
 
02:46:15.990 --> 02:46:16.000 align:start position:0%
is very important and still has a lot of
 
02:46:19.670 --> 02:46:19.680 align:start position:0%
work to do because um unfortunately
 
02:46:22.349 --> 02:46:22.359 align:start position:0%
police fire and EMS are committing
 
02:46:26.269 --> 02:46:26.279 align:start position:0%
suicide at a higher rate than joq public
 
02:46:29.030 --> 02:46:29.040 align:start position:0%
and almost as much as the veterans so we
 
02:46:31.510 --> 02:46:31.520 align:start position:0%
have a lot of work still to do and I
 
02:46:35.710 --> 02:46:35.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:38.870 --> 02:46:38.880 align:start position:0%
questions I don't see any thank you very
 
02:46:41.550 --> 02:46:41.560 align:start position:0%
much representative Brown sorry we we
 
02:46:43.469 --> 02:46:43.479 align:start position:0%
can I was a little slow there thank you
 
02:46:49.150 --> 02:46:49.160 align:start position:0%
madam shair um would you so what is I I
 
02:46:51.190 --> 02:46:51.200 align:start position:0%
understand a comfort dog well could you
 
02:46:52.510 --> 02:46:52.520 align:start position:0%
explain that a little bit for me how's
 
02:46:54.429 --> 02:46:54.439 align:start position:0%
that if I maybe I don't understand it
 
02:46:57.110 --> 02:46:57.120 align:start position:0%
that that and to be honest I don't
 
02:46:59.389 --> 02:46:59.399 align:start position:0%
understand it all very well myself I
 
02:47:01.910 --> 02:47:01.920 align:start position:0%
just know that there is certain training
 
02:47:04.870 --> 02:47:04.880 align:start position:0%
for Comfort dogs that work with
 
02:47:09.750 --> 02:47:09.760 align:start position:0%
PTSD as opposed to um grandma in the
 
02:47:12.269 --> 02:47:12.279 align:start position:0%
nursing home that they just come around
 
02:47:15.070 --> 02:47:15.080 align:start position:0%
and and you can Pat the dog and and that
 
02:47:17.309 --> 02:47:17.319 align:start position:0%
makes you feel better as opposed to the
 
02:47:19.990 --> 02:47:20.000 align:start position:0%
Comfort dog that can sense that this
 
02:47:23.750 --> 02:47:23.760 align:start position:0%
guy's stressed and goes up to them
 
02:47:25.269 --> 02:47:25.279 align:start position:0%
they'll pick you right out of a crowd
 
02:47:27.590 --> 02:47:27.600 align:start position:0%
and walk up to you and yeah just patting
 
02:47:31.070 --> 02:47:31.080 align:start position:0%
the dog and the dog being able to
 
02:47:32.349 --> 02:47:32.359 align:start position:0%
understand what's going on with that
 
02:47:36.710 --> 02:47:36.720 align:start position:0%
person to a point uh and and providing
 
02:47:39.630 --> 02:47:39.640 align:start position:0%
you know that care and it truly is care
 
02:47:42.389 --> 02:47:42.399 align:start position:0%
right perfect thank
 
02:47:46.630 --> 02:47:46.640 align:start position:0%
you man py thank you Madame chair so
 
02:47:49.190 --> 02:47:49.200 align:start position:0%
this is not a personal dog like or
 
02:47:53.070 --> 02:47:53.080 align:start position:0%
diabetes or uh autism where you know you
 
02:47:56.349 --> 02:47:56.359 align:start position:0%
have uh no seizure dogs that sense the
 
02:48:00.190 --> 02:48:00.200 align:start position:0%
aura this is a firefighter will be
 
02:48:03.510 --> 02:48:03.520 align:start position:0%
taking a dog into a crowd or into public
 
02:48:06.110 --> 02:48:06.120 align:start position:0%
and they will be sensing
 
02:48:09.670 --> 02:48:09.680 align:start position:0%
another individual in public that might
 
02:48:11.269 --> 02:48:11.279 align:start position:0%
be stress and that might be
 
02:48:13.190 --> 02:48:13.200 align:start position:0%
contemplating soci so there
 
02:48:15.790 --> 02:48:15.800 align:start position:0%
are two different categories and both of
 
02:48:17.429 --> 02:48:17.439 align:start position:0%
those are are the categories right
 
02:48:20.870 --> 02:48:20.880 align:start position:0%
because uh you seen veterans and I
 
02:48:22.469 --> 02:48:22.479 align:start position:0%
actually know a couple of firefighters
 
02:48:25.510 --> 02:48:25.520 align:start position:0%
that have their own Comfort dog that go
 
02:48:28.230 --> 02:48:28.240 align:start position:0%
with them everywhere uh one of the
 
02:48:29.870 --> 02:48:29.880 align:start position:0%
things that my team does is what we call
 
02:48:31.630 --> 02:48:31.640 align:start position:0%
a debriefing right we get everybody
 
02:48:33.070 --> 02:48:33.080 align:start position:0%
involved in the incident we sit around
 
02:48:35.630 --> 02:48:35.640 align:start position:0%
in a in a circle and we discuss a call
 
02:48:38.110 --> 02:48:38.120 align:start position:0%
and and do some things and a dog will
 
02:48:40.269 --> 02:48:40.279 align:start position:0%
come in and walk the
 
02:48:43.790 --> 02:48:43.800 align:start position:0%
circle right and maybe sit down in front
 
02:48:45.870 --> 02:48:45.880 align:start position:0%
of somebody for a little bit they get to
 
02:48:48.550 --> 02:48:48.560 align:start position:0%
Pat them while other people are talking
 
02:48:50.590 --> 02:48:50.600 align:start position:0%
uh and once the dog kind of senses that
 
02:48:53.070 --> 02:48:53.080 align:start position:0%
that guy's a little bit better because
 
02:48:54.429 --> 02:48:54.439 align:start position:0%
as you're talking about the incident
 
02:48:56.830 --> 02:48:56.840 align:start position:0%
you're going to bring up those emotions
 
02:48:59.910 --> 02:48:59.920 align:start position:0%
again uh and for some people it's pretty
 
02:49:01.910 --> 02:49:01.920 align:start position:0%
significant and the dog will go right
 
02:49:04.830 --> 02:49:04.840 align:start position:0%
over and and and it takes away that
 
02:49:09.190 --> 02:49:09.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:14.630 --> 02:49:14.640 align:start position:0%
watch I'm sh it thank you madam chair um
 
02:49:17.950 --> 02:49:17.960 align:start position:0%
are thank you for taking my question do
 
02:49:22.110 --> 02:49:22.120 align:start position:0%
you foresee that these dogs would for
 
02:49:25.870 --> 02:49:25.880 align:start position:0%
example be able to Intuit someone who is
 
02:49:25.880 --> 02:49:27.150 align:start position:0%
example be able to Intuit someone who is
in

02:49:27.150 --> 02:49:27.160 align:start position:0%
in
 
02:49:30.910 --> 02:49:30.920 align:start position:0%
stress um because that followup that to
 
02:49:34.349 --> 02:49:34.359 align:start position:0%
me would be more a designation as a
 
02:49:37.950 --> 02:49:37.960 align:start position:0%
service dog Comfort dogs usually do
 
02:49:41.190 --> 02:49:41.200 align:start position:0%
apply to dogs that go into hospitals and
 
02:49:43.910 --> 02:49:43.920 align:start position:0%
just provide comp it I think that's
 
02:49:45.790 --> 02:49:45.800 align:start position:0%
something that we can discuss when
 
02:49:47.550 --> 02:49:47.560 align:start position:0%
they've got their outline of what the
 
02:49:50.309 --> 02:49:50.319 align:start position:0%
rules are oh I just wanted to establish
 
02:49:52.550 --> 02:49:52.560 align:start position:0%
what what they felt the dog was supposed
 
02:49:56.269 --> 02:49:56.279 align:start position:0%
to do so uh like I said I'm not a
 
02:49:59.229 --> 02:49:59.239 align:start position:0%
Comforts service dog expert I just know
 
02:50:01.309 --> 02:50:01.319 align:start position:0%
that there's just different standards
 
02:50:04.429 --> 02:50:04.439 align:start position:0%
and I've seen them work so I'm not
 
02:50:06.590 --> 02:50:06.600 align:start position:0%
sure and that's what the commission's
 
02:50:08.269 --> 02:50:08.279 align:start position:0%
for to figure all that
 
02:50:11.110 --> 02:50:11.120 align:start position:0%
out thank you anyone
 
02:50:14.030 --> 02:50:14.040 align:start position:0%

responder law enforcement officer for
 
02:53:48.070 --> 02:53:48.080 align:start position:0%
almost 39 years um I just wanted to come
 
02:53:49.510 --> 02:53:49.520 align:start position:0%
in because I've been the department of
 
02:53:51.830 --> 02:53:51.840 align:start position:0%
safety representative to this commission
 
02:53:54.630 --> 02:53:54.640 align:start position:0%
since its Inception and just to let
 
02:53:56.510 --> 02:53:56.520 align:start position:0%
everybody know that apart from the other
 
02:53:58.150 --> 02:53:58.160 align:start position:0%
things that were brought up and all
 
02:54:00.110 --> 02:54:00.120 align:start position:0%
great points and appreciate Nami and
 
02:54:03.070 --> 02:54:03.080 align:start position:0%
certainly uh representative PR and all
 
02:54:05.070 --> 02:54:05.080 align:start position:0%
the work that Senator burnel has done
 
02:54:08.030 --> 02:54:08.040 align:start position:0%
but how much uh it has become a focal
 
02:54:10.750 --> 02:54:10.760 align:start position:0%
point for First Responders and helping
 
02:54:13.150 --> 02:54:13.160 align:start position:0%
themselves and having the ability to see
 
02:54:14.630 --> 02:54:14.640 align:start position:0%
things that we really weren't keeping
 
02:54:17.229 --> 02:54:17.239 align:start position:0%
track of when I started there was there
 
02:54:20.269 --> 02:54:20.279 align:start position:0%
was next to no mental health or any
 
02:54:23.550 --> 02:54:23.560 align:start position:0%
training at all that would leave you to
 
02:54:25.790 --> 02:54:25.800 align:start position:0%
understand postt Trum traumatic or acute
 
02:54:28.830 --> 02:54:28.840 align:start position:0%
stress or all the all the damaging
 
02:54:31.790 --> 02:54:31.800 align:start position:0%
effects of the job um and unfortunately
 
02:54:34.630 --> 02:54:34.640 align:start position:0%
we've lost um you know First Responders
 
02:54:37.269 --> 02:54:37.279 align:start position:0%
to suicides that I have personally known
 
02:54:39.070 --> 02:54:39.080 align:start position:0%
we have had people enter into
 
02:54:41.229 --> 02:54:41.239 align:start position:0%
retirements that are not peaceful and
 
02:54:42.469 --> 02:54:42.479 align:start position:0%
even though they may have earned one
 
02:54:45.030 --> 02:54:45.040 align:start position:0%
we've had a lot of U careers cut short
 
02:54:48.830 --> 02:54:48.840 align:start position:0%
and you know uh uh numerous marriages
 
02:54:51.030 --> 02:54:51.040 align:start position:0%
and relationships dissolved uh because
 
02:54:52.790 --> 02:54:52.800 align:start position:0%
of some of the stresses of the job so
 
02:54:55.429 --> 02:54:55.439 align:start position:0%
this commission has brought together uh
 
02:54:56.950 --> 02:54:56.960 align:start position:0%
the right people and the right people
 
02:54:58.910 --> 02:54:58.920 align:start position:0%
are at the table it is a very well
 
02:55:02.590 --> 02:55:02.600 align:start position:0%
attended commission uh every meeting um
 
02:55:04.469 --> 02:55:04.479 align:start position:0%
and it gives us the ability to look at
 
02:55:06.030 --> 02:55:06.040 align:start position:0%
what are really the important issues
 
02:55:07.389 --> 02:55:07.399 align:start position:0%
because the people that are sitting at
 
02:55:09.469 --> 02:55:09.479 align:start position:0%
the table have experienced them
 
02:55:12.910 --> 02:55:12.920 align:start position:0%
themselves so um it has been a
 
02:55:14.870 --> 02:55:14.880 align:start position:0%
tremendous value to those people that
 
02:55:16.630 --> 02:55:16.640 align:start position:0%
are actually doing the work and I
 
02:55:18.750 --> 02:55:18.760 align:start position:0%
oversee all the PE peer Serv services
 
02:55:21.309 --> 02:55:21.319 align:start position:0%
for state police and uh for the
 
02:55:24.150 --> 02:55:24.160 align:start position:0%
Department of Safety and that um we are
 
02:55:26.750 --> 02:55:26.760 align:start position:0%
helping people get through uh incidents
 
02:55:28.550 --> 02:55:28.560 align:start position:0%
where they have acute and post-traumatic
 
02:55:30.389 --> 02:55:30.399 align:start position:0%
stress and keep them from entering a
 
02:55:33.429 --> 02:55:33.439 align:start position:0%
phase where it becomes so debilitating
 
02:55:35.469 --> 02:55:35.479 align:start position:0%
that they can't come to work or that
 
02:55:37.950 --> 02:55:37.960 align:start position:0%
they have uh you know are considering
 
02:55:41.429 --> 02:55:41.439 align:start position:0%
suicidal ideations as an option and I
 
02:55:43.110 --> 02:55:43.120 align:start position:0%
know there's been a couple of questions
 
02:55:46.309 --> 02:55:46.319 align:start position:0%
but uh suicide with First Responders is
 
02:55:47.950 --> 02:55:47.960 align:start position:0%
something that's very hard to track and
 
02:55:49.790 --> 02:55:49.800 align:start position:0%
it's something we talk about a lot and I
 
02:55:52.030 --> 02:55:52.040 align:start position:0%
could tell you anecdotally I responded
 
02:55:55.190 --> 02:55:55.200 align:start position:0%
to First Responders in crisis that were
 
02:55:57.229 --> 02:55:57.239 align:start position:0%
having suicidal ideations and got them
 
02:56:00.309 --> 02:56:00.319 align:start position:0%
to a place where they were cared for and
 
02:56:02.309 --> 02:56:02.319 align:start position:0%
got them to professionals and I know we
 
02:56:04.309 --> 02:56:04.319 align:start position:0%
saved lives
 
02:56:06.950 --> 02:56:06.960 align:start position:0%
unfortunately um the statistics are
 
02:56:09.510 --> 02:56:09.520 align:start position:0%
shocking uh when it comes to uh First
 
02:56:11.070 --> 02:56:11.080 align:start position:0%
Responders suicides and I'm talking
 
02:56:13.110 --> 02:56:13.120 align:start position:0%
First Responders as a whole firefighters
 
02:56:15.389 --> 02:56:15.399 align:start position:0%
and police dispatchers and police
 
02:56:18.030 --> 02:56:18.040 align:start position:0%
officers and and EMTs had the whole
 
02:56:20.110 --> 02:56:20.120 align:start position:0%
group group as a whole so it's something
 
02:56:22.110 --> 02:56:22.120 align:start position:0%
that has to be worked on and frankly
 
02:56:24.670 --> 02:56:24.680 align:start position:0%
unless we have commissions like this
 
02:56:26.790 --> 02:56:26.800 align:start position:0%
literally with their foot on the gas all
 
02:56:28.830 --> 02:56:28.840 align:start position:0%
the time assuring that we're looking at
 
02:56:30.429 --> 02:56:30.439 align:start position:0%
this and hearing from the right people
 
02:56:31.870 --> 02:56:31.880 align:start position:0%
we have some tremendous speakers that
 
02:56:35.269 --> 02:56:35.279 align:start position:0%
come to these meetings um uh that it's
 
02:56:38.469 --> 02:56:38.479 align:start position:0%
it's it's a tough one to nail down and
 
02:56:39.870 --> 02:56:39.880 align:start position:0%
you have direct questions and they're
 
02:56:41.389 --> 02:56:41.399 align:start position:0%
very hard to answer because
 
02:56:44.590 --> 02:56:44.600 align:start position:0%
realistically there's been very little
 
02:56:47.110 --> 02:56:47.120 align:start position:0%
um that has been done to focus and this
 
02:56:49.389 --> 02:56:49.399 align:start position:0%
particular Commission in this group is
 
02:56:51.710 --> 02:56:51.720 align:start position:0%
one that is not repeated very often in
 
02:56:54.469 --> 02:56:54.479 align:start position:0%
the country um so I think it's it's of
 
02:56:58.229 --> 02:56:58.239 align:start position:0%
tremendous value it it it reminds me of
 
02:56:59.990 --> 02:57:00.000 align:start position:0%
why I've been so proud to be a
 
02:57:01.309 --> 02:57:01.319 align:start position:0%
professional in New Hampshire and that
 
02:57:03.510 --> 02:57:03.520 align:start position:0%
we are usually out in front of a lot of
 
02:57:06.630 --> 02:57:06.640 align:start position:0%
important issues so I just uh wanted to
 
02:57:08.710 --> 02:57:08.720 align:start position:0%
just add just a couple of comments on
 
02:57:10.910 --> 02:57:10.920 align:start position:0%
the value of it and the value of it to
 
02:57:13.229 --> 02:57:13.239 align:start position:0%
First Responders not only like me uh
 
02:57:15.830 --> 02:57:15.840 align:start position:0%
that came on when I did but all the new
 
02:57:17.870 --> 02:57:17.880 align:start position:0%
people entering the profession and if
 
02:57:19.950 --> 02:57:19.960 align:start position:0%
you came into the first responder
 
02:57:23.389 --> 02:57:23.399 align:start position:0%
profession within the last 10 years uh
 
02:57:25.429 --> 02:57:25.439 align:start position:0%
when we really got things off the ground
 
02:57:27.229 --> 02:57:27.239 align:start position:0%
you would know it no different there
 
02:57:28.990 --> 02:57:29.000 align:start position:0%
will always be help for you there will
 
02:57:30.510 --> 02:57:30.520 align:start position:0%
always be professionals there will
 
02:57:32.990 --> 02:57:33.000 align:start position:0%
always be people that are willing to get
 
02:57:34.590 --> 02:57:34.600 align:start position:0%
you through a very rough spot in your
 
02:57:36.790 --> 02:57:36.800 align:start position:0%
career and that is going to make a huge
 
02:57:38.389 --> 02:57:38.399 align:start position:0%
difference and I don't know how you know
 
02:57:40.710 --> 02:57:40.720 align:start position:0%
hopefully we can track it by all these
 
02:57:42.830 --> 02:57:42.840 align:start position:0%
great young professionals that enter the
 
02:57:44.670 --> 02:57:44.680 align:start position:0%

Madame chair
 
04:03:59.830 --> 04:03:59.840 align:start position:0%
um it has been the policy of this
 
04:04:02.830 --> 04:04:02.840 align:start position:0%
committee not to adopt special
 
04:04:05.950 --> 04:04:05.960 align:start position:0%
days not because we don't care about
 
04:04:08.830 --> 04:04:08.840 align:start position:0%
them but because there is no vehicle
 
04:04:14.590 --> 04:04:14.600 align:start position:0%
that really um allows the promotion or
 
04:04:17.670 --> 04:04:17.680 align:start position:0%
expansion of the information that is
 
04:04:21.030 --> 04:04:21.040 align:start position:0%
expected as a result of this special day
 
04:04:24.830 --> 04:04:24.840 align:start position:0%
and until we have that I don't we have
 
04:04:24.840 --> 04:04:25.870 align:start position:0%
and until we have that I don't we have
decided

04:04:25.870 --> 04:04:25.880 align:start position:0%
decided
 
04:04:30.349 --> 04:04:30.359 align:start position:0%
to um itl these bills in
 
04:04:34.269 --> 04:04:34.279 align:start position:0%
committee any represent go thank you
 
04:04:37.590 --> 04:04:37.600 align:start position:0%
madam chair I will say we have
 
04:04:41.469 --> 04:04:41.479 align:start position:0%
numerous days in the statute that a lot
 
04:04:44.070 --> 04:04:44.080 align:start position:0%
of people don't even know are are there
 
04:04:46.830 --> 04:04:46.840 align:start position:0%
due to the um inactivity of these
 
04:04:49.590 --> 04:04:49.600 align:start position:0%
organizations once they petition this
 
04:04:52.309 --> 04:04:52.319 align:start position:0%
committee to get them put into statute
 
04:04:54.070 --> 04:04:54.080 align:start position:0%
um we just heard from the individual
 
04:04:57.429 --> 04:04:57.439 align:start position:0%
that uh the senator had the governor do
 
04:04:59.870 --> 04:04:59.880 align:start position:0%
a proclamation which I think is very
 
04:04:59.880 --> 04:05:01.389 align:start position:0%
a proclamation which I think is very
appropriate

04:05:01.389 --> 04:05:01.399 align:start position:0%
appropriate
 
04:05:06.349 --> 04:05:06.359 align:start position:0%
to yearly go to the governor and justify
 
04:05:08.269 --> 04:05:08.279 align:start position:0%
why the proclamation should be made
 
04:05:09.870 --> 04:05:09.880 align:start position:0%
versus just putting it in statute and
 
04:05:12.070 --> 04:05:12.080 align:start position:0%
letting it be buried there um so I think
 
04:05:14.389 --> 04:05:14.399 align:start position:0%
we have a uh heard from this gentleman
 
04:05:16.630 --> 04:05:16.640 align:start position:0%
that it was done before and I think
 
04:05:18.229 --> 04:05:18.239 align:start position:0%
continuing to do that will bring these
 
04:05:20.389 --> 04:05:20.399 align:start position:0%
groups out to petition the governor
 
04:05:22.429 --> 04:05:22.439 align:start position:0%
thank you all
 
04:05:25.630 --> 04:05:25.640 align:start position:0%

goalie if there's no one else then the
 
04:05:37.149 --> 04:05:37.159 align:start position:0%

important to me to watch the work this
 
04:08:27.269 --> 04:08:27.279 align:start position:0%
commission does um as everyone knows I'm
 
04:08:30.790 --> 04:08:30.800 align:start position:0%
a retired captain manchest of fire and
 
04:08:33.790 --> 04:08:33.800 align:start position:0%
for the last day of my work and my
 
04:08:37.309 --> 04:08:37.319 align:start position:0%
career was going to the funeral of one
 
04:08:38.349 --> 04:08:38.359 align:start position:0%
of my
 
04:08:41.510 --> 04:08:41.520 align:start position:0%
working one of the men that worked at my
 
04:08:45.030 --> 04:08:45.040 align:start position:0%
station that had committed suicide
 
04:08:47.550 --> 04:08:47.560 align:start position:0%
so this is near and dear to my heart and
 
04:08:51.030 --> 04:08:51.040 align:start position:0%
I hope we can support this thank you
 
04:08:51.040 --> 04:08:52.189 align:start position:0%
I hope we can support this thank you
anyone

04:08:52.189 --> 04:08:52.199 align:start position:0%
anyone
 
04:08:55.830 --> 04:08:55.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:58.830 --> 04:08:58.840 align:start position:0%
Gard yeah I'd like to comment that I'm
 
04:09:00.950 --> 04:09:00.960 align:start position:0%
very optimistic about this Commission
 
04:09:02.550 --> 04:09:02.560 align:start position:0%
because there is not one person
 
04:09:04.309 --> 04:09:04.319 align:start position:0%
appointed by the governor and
 
04:09:07.710 --> 04:09:07.720 align:start position:0%
counsel every everybody is appointed by
 
04:09:10.229 --> 04:09:10.239 align:start position:0%
an organization that cares about the
 
04:09:12.149 --> 04:09:12.159 align:start position:0%
results so they will get people
 
04:09:15.510 --> 04:09:15.520 align:start position:0%
appointed quickly and get rolling fast
 
04:09:15.520 --> 04:09:17.309 align:start position:0%
appointed quickly and get rolling fast
so

04:09:17.309 --> 04:09:17.319 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:09:20.670 --> 04:09:20.680 align:start position:0%
I'm more impressed than I am with most
 
04:09:24.910 --> 04:09:24.920 align:start position:0%
commissions anyone else representative
 
04:09:27.510 --> 04:09:27.520 align:start position:0%
Schmid thank you madam chair and I share
 
04:09:29.429 --> 04:09:29.439 align:start position:0%
the sentiments that my colleagues have
 
04:09:33.109 --> 04:09:33.119 align:start position:0%
expressed already this this is a a real
 
04:09:36.990 --> 04:09:37.000 align:start position:0%
issue and this is there's also something
 
04:09:38.910 --> 04:09:38.920 align:start position:0%
that can be done about it and these
 
04:09:41.189 --> 04:09:41.199 align:start position:0%
these Comfort dogs and so forth but the
 
04:09:42.950 --> 04:09:42.960 align:start position:0%
recognition of the stress that these
 
04:09:44.149 --> 04:09:44.159 align:start position:0%
people are
 
04:09:49.030 --> 04:09:49.040 align:start position:0%
under uh dealing with trauma that that
 
04:09:51.389 --> 04:09:51.399 align:start position:0%
most of us never experiened and never
 
04:09:53.790 --> 04:09:53.800 align:start position:0%
even hear about and they're dealing with
 
04:09:58.070 --> 04:09:58.080 align:start position:0%
it on a daily basis so I'm totally in
 
04:10:02.750 --> 04:10:02.760 align:start position:0%
support of this Bill thank you anyone

04:11:12.229 --> 04:11:12.239 align:start position:0%
minutes so do we want to talk about uh
 
04:11:12.239 --> 04:11:15.650 align:start position:0%
minutes so do we want to talk about uh
437

04:11:15.650 --> 04:11:15.660 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:15.660 --> 04:11:28.630 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

04:11:28.630 --> 04:11:28.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:33.790 --> 04:11:33.800 align:start position:0%
no can we speak about 437 if we can talk
 
04:11:37.070 --> 04:11:37.080 align:start position:0%
about it without Noti it because it was
 
04:11:39.229 --> 04:11:39.239 align:start position:0%
it's we heard it today therefore we can
 
04:11:42.670 --> 04:11:42.680 align:start position:0%
talk we don't have to vote on it but uh
 
04:11:49.309 --> 04:11:49.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:51.750 --> 04:11:51.760 align:start position:0%
about well if we can if we can talk
 
04:11:53.710 --> 04:11:53.720 align:start position:0%
about it um
 
04:11:57.389 --> 04:11:57.399 align:start position:0%
representative Maguire representative um
 
04:11:59.349 --> 04:11:59.359 align:start position:0%
oh my gosh it's Patrick and I talked
 
04:12:02.269 --> 04:12:02.279 align:start position:0%
about this because I think essentially
 
04:12:05.469 --> 04:12:05.479 align:start position:0%
what the bill is trying to do is trying
 
04:12:09.590 --> 04:12:09.600 align:start position:0%
to um say to municipalities that if they
 
04:12:12.750 --> 04:12:12.760 align:start position:0%
do not send their their amendments to
 
04:12:15.550 --> 04:12:15.560 align:start position:0%
the bill R you their fire amendments or
 
04:12:17.429 --> 04:12:17.439 align:start position:0%
their oh my God amendments the state
 
04:12:20.590 --> 04:12:20.600 align:start position:0%
fire code or the state building codes to
 
04:12:22.630 --> 04:12:22.640 align:start position:0%
the appropriate person either the State
 
04:12:24.950 --> 04:12:24.960 align:start position:0%
Fire marcial or the building review the
 
04:12:27.630 --> 04:12:27.640 align:start position:0%
building code review board then those
 
04:12:30.070 --> 04:12:30.080 align:start position:0%
amendments won't will not be enforced
 
04:12:31.349 --> 04:12:31.359 align:start position:0%
until they've been
 
04:12:31.359 --> 04:12:33.510 align:start position:0%
until they've been
submitted

04:12:33.510 --> 04:12:33.520 align:start position:0%
submitted
 
04:12:36.469 --> 04:12:36.479 align:start position:0%
appropriately and I
 
04:12:39.349 --> 04:12:39.359 align:start position:0%
guess we'd like to I like to we both
 
04:12:41.229 --> 04:12:41.239 align:start position:0%
would like a sentence that says
 
04:12:43.950 --> 04:12:43.960 align:start position:0%
municipalities who submit local
 
04:12:47.349 --> 04:12:47.359 align:start position:0%
amendments in compliance with this
 
04:12:47.359 --> 04:12:50.229 align:start position:0%
amendments in compliance with this
statute

04:12:50.229 --> 04:12:50.239 align:start position:0%
statute
 
04:12:54.590 --> 04:12:54.600 align:start position:0%
um have amendments that are fully
 
04:12:57.309 --> 04:12:57.319 align:start position:0%
enforcable and I don't know whether or
 
04:13:00.149 --> 04:13:00.159 align:start position:0%
not I don't know how we're going to
 
04:13:01.790 --> 04:13:01.800 align:start position:0%
enforce that who's going to be
 
04:13:04.510 --> 04:13:04.520 align:start position:0%
responsible for not enforcing that's the
 
04:13:07.710 --> 04:13:07.720 align:start position:0%
part that I can't okay representative
 
04:13:10.429 --> 04:13:10.439 align:start position:0%
laus yeah so I think that according to
 
04:13:12.309 --> 04:13:12.319 align:start position:0%
this they not only have to submit it but
 
04:13:14.269 --> 04:13:14.279 align:start position:0%
they have to be confirmed confirmed what
 
04:13:16.710 --> 04:13:16.720 align:start position:0%
he said confirmation is just making sure
 
04:13:19.149 --> 04:13:19.159 align:start position:0%
that they passed it through a legal
 
04:13:21.590 --> 04:13:21.600 align:start position:0%
process it doesn't conflict with the
 
04:13:24.189 --> 04:13:24.199 align:start position:0%
statute violate the statute which are
 
04:13:25.830 --> 04:13:25.840 align:start position:0%
things like it can't be less stringent
 
04:13:27.149 --> 04:13:27.159 align:start position:0%
in the building code it can't try and
 
04:13:28.990 --> 04:13:29.000 align:start position:0%
replace a whole chunk and all that and
 
04:13:29.950 --> 04:13:29.960 align:start position:0%
then it's
 
04:13:35.510 --> 04:13:35.520 align:start position:0%
automatic um so is the concern that you
 
04:13:37.109 --> 04:13:37.119 align:start position:0%
want them to be able to enforce it
 
04:13:38.990 --> 04:13:39.000 align:start position:0%
before that confirmation has occurred
 
04:13:40.389 --> 04:13:40.399 align:start position:0%
and if so is the concern the building
 
04:13:41.910 --> 04:13:41.920 align:start position:0%
code review board isn't is going to sit
 
04:13:45.149 --> 04:13:45.159 align:start position:0%
on it or no what I'm saying is how is it
 
04:13:48.030 --> 04:13:48.040 align:start position:0%
that well municipalities who don't abide
 
04:13:48.040 --> 04:13:49.109 align:start position:0%
that well municipalities who don't abide
by

04:13:49.109 --> 04:13:49.119 align:start position:0%
by
 
04:13:52.710 --> 04:13:52.720 align:start position:0%
this right yeah to begin with why would
 
04:13:55.070 --> 04:13:55.080 align:start position:0%
they not enforce see this is the thing
 
04:13:56.790 --> 04:13:56.800 align:start position:0%
who's going to make sure that those
 
04:14:00.229 --> 04:14:00.239 align:start position:0%
building that those amendments are not
 
04:14:04.149 --> 04:14:04.159 align:start position:0%
being enforced so I I I mean somebody I
 
04:14:06.189 --> 04:14:06.199 align:start position:0%
don't know somebody could complain so I
 
04:14:07.349 --> 04:14:07.359 align:start position:0%
mean you could sue them and if they're
 
04:14:08.429 --> 04:14:08.439 align:start position:0%
not if they're trying to enforce
 
04:14:10.429 --> 04:14:10.439 align:start position:0%
amendments which are not but who's going
 
04:14:12.550 --> 04:14:12.560 align:start position:0%
to sue who who's going to Su you town
 
04:14:14.830 --> 04:14:14.840 align:start position:0%
the Builder or somebody who's building
 
04:14:16.469 --> 04:14:16.479 align:start position:0%
that they're being told they can't do by
 
04:14:19.670 --> 04:14:19.680 align:start position:0%
the okay the okay the unapproved
 
04:14:22.790 --> 04:14:22.800 align:start position:0%
ordinance no okay would be able to soo
 
04:14:24.630 --> 04:14:24.640 align:start position:0%
the town and I don't know if anybody
 
04:14:26.189 --> 04:14:26.199 align:start position:0%
could just go to the AG and report them
 
04:14:27.389 --> 04:14:27.399 align:start position:0%
if they do anything I don't know how
 
04:14:30.149 --> 04:14:30.159 align:start position:0%
that works the AG I don't think would be
 
04:14:31.790 --> 04:14:31.800 align:start position:0%
the right place to take a complaint
 
04:14:35.710 --> 04:14:35.720 align:start position:0%
against a town it would be um super
 
04:14:38.910 --> 04:14:38.920 align:start position:0%
Court yeah the town might take
 
04:14:41.550 --> 04:14:41.560 align:start position:0%
a take
 
04:14:44.309 --> 04:14:44.319 align:start position:0%
a somebody applying for an illicit
 
04:14:47.389 --> 04:14:47.399 align:start position:0%
building permit to the AG but not not
 
04:14:49.630 --> 04:14:49.640 align:start position:0%
the other way around okay I was and then
 
04:14:50.670 --> 04:14:50.680 align:start position:0%
that would be a defense if they're
 
04:14:52.109 --> 04:14:52.119 align:start position:0%
trying to enforce something they not
 
04:14:53.269 --> 04:14:53.279 align:start position:0%
have they don't have the legal right to
 
04:14:55.990 --> 04:14:56.000 align:start position:0%
do and yeah yeah I mean the the trouble
 
04:14:58.030 --> 04:14:58.040 align:start position:0%
is that in many cases if the building
 
04:15:00.030 --> 04:15:00.040 align:start position:0%
inspector decides he wants it done this
 
04:15:03.750 --> 04:15:03.760 align:start position:0%
way even without a formal
 
04:15:05.870 --> 04:15:05.880 align:start position:0%
ordinance he can make life very
 
04:15:07.910 --> 04:15:07.920 align:start position:0%
miserable for anybody involved I've
 
04:15:09.910 --> 04:15:09.920 align:start position:0%
talked to people who've been doing work
 
04:15:11.630 --> 04:15:11.640 align:start position:0%
in some towns where that's what what
 
04:15:14.510 --> 04:15:14.520 align:start position:0%
goes on they make up their own rules and
 
04:15:16.429 --> 04:15:16.439 align:start position:0%
and if you don't go along with it life's
 
04:15:19.510 --> 04:15:19.520 align:start position:0%
going to be difficult so goalie thank
 
04:15:20.670 --> 04:15:20.680 align:start position:0%
you m
 
04:15:25.710 --> 04:15:25.720 align:start position:0%
chair I like what this is doing I just
 
04:15:27.070 --> 04:15:27.080 align:start position:0%
wish we
 
04:15:30.309 --> 04:15:30.319 align:start position:0%
could put some teeth to it like we've
 
04:15:31.950 --> 04:15:31.960 align:start position:0%
done with the reporting requirements for
 
04:15:33.429 --> 04:15:33.439 align:start position:0%
the retirement system and if you don't
 
04:15:35.469 --> 04:15:35.479 align:start position:0%
do it there's a penalty associated with
 
04:15:38.070 --> 04:15:38.080 align:start position:0%
it because I don't think it's fair to
 
04:15:40.469 --> 04:15:40.479 align:start position:0%
those Builders to have to now pick up
 
04:15:42.670 --> 04:15:42.680 align:start position:0%
court costs and attorney fees because
 
04:15:44.910 --> 04:15:44.920 align:start position:0%
hey town is going gone Rogue and wanting
 
04:15:46.790 --> 04:15:46.800 align:start position:0%
to enforce their own rules however they
 
04:15:50.950 --> 04:15:50.960 align:start position:0%
feel fit and that's just an issue I have
 
04:15:52.429 --> 04:15:52.439 align:start position:0%
I mean I have no problem passing this
 
04:15:54.309 --> 04:15:54.319 align:start position:0%
without it but I think there should be
 
04:15:56.349 --> 04:15:56.359 align:start position:0%
some teeth to it I I agree with you
 
04:15:58.550 --> 04:15:58.560 align:start position:0%
completely representative
 
04:16:00.910 --> 04:16:00.920 align:start position:0%
Gart I'm wondering though if it's
 
04:16:04.309 --> 04:16:04.319 align:start position:0%
possible to to quantify those costs so
 
04:16:05.990 --> 04:16:06.000 align:start position:0%
if you if you have a job lined up you
 
04:16:07.670 --> 04:16:07.680 align:start position:0%
have different subcontracts coming in at
 
04:16:09.269 --> 04:16:09.279 align:start position:0%
different times if the building
 
04:16:11.630 --> 04:16:11.640 align:start position:0%
inspector wants to make up some fugazi
 
04:16:13.830 --> 04:16:13.840 align:start position:0%
elect you know electrical requirements
 
04:16:15.269 --> 04:16:15.279 align:start position:0%
and now you miss your other
 
04:16:17.149 --> 04:16:17.159 align:start position:0%
subcontractors D it's going to be hard
 
04:16:18.710 --> 04:16:18.720 align:start position:0%
to say how much money you've really lost
 
04:16:20.630 --> 04:16:20.640 align:start position:0%
and I think it would also set up maybe
 
04:16:23.349 --> 04:16:23.359 align:start position:0%
potential for false lawsuits and I don't
 
04:16:25.070 --> 04:16:25.080 align:start position:0%
know I just that might get kind of messy
 
04:16:30.349 --> 04:16:30.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:33.189 --> 04:16:33.199 align:start position:0%
hand the town should be penalized for
 
04:16:35.389 --> 04:16:35.399 align:start position:0%
not putting on to submitting to the
 
04:16:37.309 --> 04:16:37.319 align:start position:0%
building code review board or the Fire
 
04:16:39.990 --> 04:16:40.000 align:start position:0%
Control Board their amendments showing
 
04:16:41.670 --> 04:16:41.680 align:start position:0%
so that they're posted online what they
 
04:16:43.590 --> 04:16:43.600 align:start position:0%
are my
 
04:16:44.990 --> 04:16:45.000 align:start position:0%
my point being is if the building
 
04:16:46.630 --> 04:16:46.640 align:start position:0%
inspector just went off the reservation
 
04:16:48.070 --> 04:16:48.080 align:start position:0%
by himself it wasn't something do you
 
04:16:49.149 --> 04:16:49.159 align:start position:0%
know what I mean he's just making stuff
 
04:16:51.030 --> 04:16:51.040 align:start position:0%
up it happens I'm just saying so we've
 
04:16:53.429 --> 04:16:53.439 align:start position:0%
heard representative lus yeah I'm just
 
04:16:57.389 --> 04:16:57.399 align:start position:0%
wondering on that one um so who who
 
04:16:59.229 --> 04:16:59.239 align:start position:0%
would how would that be enforced who
 
04:17:00.750 --> 04:17:00.760 align:start position:0%
would be responsible if you're not if
 
04:17:03.349 --> 04:17:03.359 align:start position:0%
it's not going to be a civil suit by a a
 
04:17:06.269 --> 04:17:06.279 align:start position:0%
builder or something then you know could
 
04:17:09.710 --> 04:17:09.720 align:start position:0%
be reported to some somebody who in the
 
04:17:11.030 --> 04:17:11.040 align:start position:0%
government who then does something or
 
04:17:14.510 --> 04:17:14.520 align:start position:0%
how how do you envision that working
 
04:17:14.520 --> 04:17:15.950 align:start position:0%
how how do you envision that working
representative

04:17:15.950 --> 04:17:15.960 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:17:18.750 --> 04:17:18.760 align:start position:0%
Schmidt thank you madam chair well if if
 
04:17:20.710 --> 04:17:20.720 align:start position:0%
we have these concerns I think we ought
 
04:17:23.189 --> 04:17:23.199 align:start position:0%
to have a subcommittee but the but the
 
04:17:26.309 --> 04:17:26.319 align:start position:0%
bottom line is the building code review
 
04:17:30.229 --> 04:17:30.239 align:start position:0%
board uh and um Carol you you you know
 
04:17:33.590 --> 04:17:33.600 align:start position:0%
you've been dealing with this issue for
 
04:17:36.269 --> 04:17:36.279 align:start position:0%
almost as long as I have uh and that the
 
04:17:39.309 --> 04:17:39.319 align:start position:0%
building code review board is a very
 
04:17:42.990 --> 04:17:43.000 align:start position:0%
experienced uh in institution that
 
04:17:45.550 --> 04:17:45.560 align:start position:0%
headed by a real sharp guy Phil Sherman
 
04:17:47.910 --> 04:17:47.920 align:start position:0%
has been on top of the situation for
 
04:17:49.670 --> 04:17:49.680 align:start position:0%
about four or five years now as the
 
04:17:55.670 --> 04:17:55.680 align:start position:0%
chair uh and um and the and and Gary
 
04:17:57.429 --> 04:17:57.439 align:start position:0%
Abbott has
 
04:18:01.070 --> 04:18:01.080 align:start position:0%
been 20 years I've been here and he's
 
04:18:04.070 --> 04:18:04.080 align:start position:0%
been coming in with all with regard to
 
04:18:06.870 --> 04:18:06.880 align:start position:0%
all these issues but there is there was
 
04:18:09.870 --> 04:18:09.880 align:start position:0%
some question about some language you
 
04:18:12.910 --> 04:18:12.920 align:start position:0%
remember that was a little bit stickier
 
04:18:14.790 --> 04:18:14.800 align:start position:0%
they weren't sure and I think we ought
 
04:18:17.510 --> 04:18:17.520 align:start position:0%
to take a look at that and and see it
 
04:18:20.349 --> 04:18:20.359 align:start position:0%
but it's w with with this group I think
 
04:18:22.790 --> 04:18:22.800 align:start position:0%
you're and you have Bill McKenna has
 
04:18:25.429 --> 04:18:25.439 align:start position:0%
been here for all the time I've been on
 
04:18:29.349 --> 04:18:29.359 align:start position:0%
Edna as well uh and the Builders
 
04:18:32.149 --> 04:18:32.159 align:start position:0%
Association and build building
 
04:18:36.229 --> 04:18:36.239 align:start position:0%
officials uh City oversight officials
 
04:18:38.790 --> 04:18:38.800 align:start position:0%
they're all working together uh and
 
04:18:41.349 --> 04:18:41.359 align:start position:0%
monitoring this and so forth and I think
 
04:18:43.510 --> 04:18:43.520 align:start position:0%
they have a a pretty good enforcement
 
04:18:45.590 --> 04:18:45.600 align:start position:0%
procedure worked out but we ought to
 
04:18:47.670 --> 04:18:47.680 align:start position:0%
look at that the language and see if we
 
04:18:49.950 --> 04:18:49.960 align:start position:0%
can't perfect it as long as we have some
 
04:18:53.030 --> 04:18:53.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:57.109 --> 04:18:57.119 align:start position:0%
him I mean I'm I'm I'm ready to vote on
 
04:18:59.670 --> 04:18:59.680 align:start position:0%
yes on the bill but but why not fix it
 
04:19:01.790 --> 04:19:01.800 align:start position:0%
if it's got some
 
04:19:03.990 --> 04:19:04.000 align:start position:0%
issues thank you madam chair so there's
 
04:19:05.550 --> 04:19:05.560 align:start position:0%
there's two we're talking about two
 
04:19:08.389 --> 04:19:08.399 align:start position:0%
different enforcement pieces one is the
 
04:19:11.389 --> 04:19:11.399 align:start position:0%
person to enforce against the town for
 
04:19:13.910 --> 04:19:13.920 align:start position:0%
for making them follow a code that
 
04:19:17.590 --> 04:19:17.600 align:start position:0%
wasn't approved and the other one is can
 
04:19:19.910 --> 04:19:19.920 align:start position:0%
the state somehow enforce against the
 
04:19:21.990 --> 04:19:22.000 align:start position:0%
towns that don't follow this law that's
 
04:19:25.710 --> 04:19:25.720 align:start position:0%
what you're saying right how do we track
 
04:19:29.670 --> 04:19:29.680 align:start position:0%
whether the towns do follow this or not
 
04:19:33.149 --> 04:19:33.159 align:start position:0%
that's a always a challenge put notice
 
04:19:36.870 --> 04:19:36.880 align:start position:0%
as a followup I would say on we know how
 
04:19:39.670 --> 04:19:39.680 align:start position:0%
they if they do follow the procedure we
 
04:19:42.149 --> 04:19:42.159 align:start position:0%
know about it because they've submitted
 
04:19:43.389 --> 04:19:43.399 align:start position:0%
their amend
 
04:19:45.349 --> 04:19:45.359 align:start position:0%
if however a
 
04:19:47.950 --> 04:19:47.960 align:start position:0%
municipality doesn't have any amendments
 
04:19:49.550 --> 04:19:49.560 align:start position:0%
you don't know if it's because they
 
04:19:51.189 --> 04:19:51.199 align:start position:0%
haven't bothered to tell us or because
 
04:19:53.910 --> 04:19:53.920 align:start position:0%
they don't want to make any
 
04:19:56.389 --> 04:19:56.399 align:start position:0%
amendments repres blackis right I mean
 
04:19:59.070 --> 04:19:59.080 align:start position:0%
maybe um if there's some place whether
 
04:20:00.750 --> 04:20:00.760 align:start position:0%
it's building code review board or
 
04:20:03.990 --> 04:20:04.000 align:start position:0%
somebody else where someone who is aware
 
04:20:06.710 --> 04:20:06.720 align:start position:0%
that you know they've created these uh
 
04:20:08.550 --> 04:20:08.560 align:start position:0%
rules without going through the
 
04:20:11.590 --> 04:20:11.600 align:start position:0%
process um you know maybe something
 
04:20:13.630 --> 04:20:13.640 align:start position:0%
could be done for whether it's building
 
04:20:14.870 --> 04:20:14.880 align:start position:0%
cone review board or someone else to
 
04:20:16.950 --> 04:20:16.960 align:start position:0%
deal with it but I think I mean either
 
04:20:18.349 --> 04:20:18.359 align:start position:0%
it's going to be reported by somebody
 
04:20:21.429 --> 04:20:21.439 align:start position:0%
who becomes aware of it or the case
 
04:20:23.229 --> 04:20:23.239 align:start position:0%
where somebody objects to what they're
 
04:20:25.469 --> 04:20:25.479 align:start position:0%
doing and and either they're being sued
 
04:20:27.910 --> 04:20:27.920 align:start position:0%
or they sue the town or you'd have to
 
04:20:29.309 --> 04:20:29.319 align:start position:0%
have you know somebody do some kind of
 
04:20:30.870 --> 04:20:30.880 align:start position:0%
Investigation of all the ordinances of
 
04:20:32.389 --> 04:20:32.399 align:start position:0%
all the municipalities which I don't see
 
04:20:34.550 --> 04:20:34.560 align:start position:0%
happening so but if there's a way for
 
04:20:37.229 --> 04:20:37.239 align:start position:0%
somebody who notices as a problem to
 
04:20:39.389 --> 04:20:39.399 align:start position:0%
report it and then an investigation be
 
04:20:41.630 --> 04:20:41.640 align:start position:0%
done then maybe that could
 
04:20:45.429 --> 04:20:45.439 align:start position:0%
work remember two two things number one
 
04:20:50.750 --> 04:20:50.760 align:start position:0%
the fire marshal said um that
 
04:20:54.030 --> 04:20:54.040 align:start position:0%
that you got all these professional
 
04:20:56.269 --> 04:20:56.279 align:start position:0%
firefighters in the bigger towns or
 
04:20:59.070 --> 04:20:59.080 align:start position:0%
cities okay and you got volunteer
 
04:21:01.550 --> 04:21:01.560 align:start position:0%
firefighters and they know but he
 
04:21:04.269 --> 04:21:04.279 align:start position:0%
mentioned the fact that they had uh in
 
04:21:06.710 --> 04:21:06.720 align:start position:0%
one of the towns I think that they were
 
04:21:08.950 --> 04:21:08.960 align:start position:0%
putting it through the
 
04:21:13.990 --> 04:21:14.000 align:start position:0%
zoning zba right and it was not a legal
 
04:21:16.990 --> 04:21:17.000 align:start position:0%
thing at all there was no legally
 
04:21:19.469 --> 04:21:19.479 align:start position:0%
adopted ordinance in the town they were
 
04:21:22.510 --> 04:21:22.520 align:start position:0%
letting the zba do it completely
 
04:21:25.309 --> 04:21:25.319 align:start position:0%
inappropriate and not
 
04:21:27.750 --> 04:21:27.760 align:start position:0%
legal and so forth but they're getting a
 
04:21:30.269 --> 04:21:30.279 align:start position:0%
handle on all this and it's much more
 
04:21:31.790 --> 04:21:31.800 align:start position:0%
effective than it used to be in my
 
04:21:34.109 --> 04:21:34.119 align:start position:0%
opinion but let's ask the questions that
 
04:21:34.119 --> 04:21:34.830 align:start position:0%
opinion but let's ask the questions that
we

04:21:34.830 --> 04:21:34.840 align:start position:0%
we
 
04:21:37.469 --> 04:21:37.479 align:start position:0%
have Peter on your
 
04:21:39.630 --> 04:21:39.640 align:start position:0%
subcomittee okay I think there are
 
04:21:41.990 --> 04:21:42.000 align:start position:0%
enough questions that we should schedule
 
04:21:45.990 --> 04:21:46.000 align:start position:0%
a sub committee um particularly since I
 
04:21:48.229 --> 04:21:48.239 align:start position:0%
asked about the legal question we
 
04:21:51.229 --> 04:21:51.239 align:start position:0%
haven't got a response back yet uh yes
 
04:21:54.469 --> 04:21:54.479 align:start position:0%
represent goie thank you madam chair and
 
04:21:56.149 --> 04:21:56.159 align:start position:0%
I guess I apologize for bringing up and
 
04:21:59.870 --> 04:21:59.880 align:start position:0%
throwing the bomb into the works but um
 
04:22:02.910 --> 04:22:02.920 align:start position:0%
it it was just a thought obviously I
 
04:22:04.670 --> 04:22:04.680 align:start position:0%
don't think we have the time to work on
 
04:22:07.710 --> 04:22:07.720 align:start position:0%
something of that aspect this year but I
 
04:22:09.229 --> 04:22:09.239 align:start position:0%
just think if we're going to do
 
04:22:11.670 --> 04:22:11.680 align:start position:0%
something requiring cities and towns to
 
04:22:13.550 --> 04:22:13.560 align:start position:0%
do it there ought to be some sort of
 
04:22:15.309 --> 04:22:15.319 align:start position:0%
penalty like reporting in the retirement
 
04:22:17.630 --> 04:22:17.640 align:start position:0%
system at a later date to make sure it's
 
04:22:20.109 --> 04:22:20.119 align:start position:0%
done appropriately and on time
 
04:22:23.349 --> 04:22:23.359 align:start position:0%
MH okay representative Simon I think
 
04:22:25.870 --> 04:22:25.880 align:start position:0%
your question your comment uh yes just
 
04:22:28.950 --> 04:22:28.960 align:start position:0%
real briefly if I remember correctly um
 
04:22:31.950 --> 04:22:31.960 align:start position:0%
the legality issue was kind of circling
 
04:22:33.910 --> 04:22:33.920 align:start position:0%
around whether or not we could
 
04:22:36.189 --> 04:22:36.199 align:start position:0%
retroactively um take away the
 
04:22:37.550 --> 04:22:37.560 align:start position:0%
enforcement ability of the
 
04:22:39.309 --> 04:22:39.319 align:start position:0%
municipalities to enforce the code that
 
04:22:42.950 --> 04:22:42.960 align:start position:0%
they had put in the interim but if I
 
04:22:44.590 --> 04:22:44.600 align:start position:0%
understood Mr Sherman correctly that's
 
04:22:46.030 --> 04:22:46.040 align:start position:0%
going to be a moot point because as soon
 
04:22:48.309 --> 04:22:48.319 align:start position:0%
as this bill is passed we'll be updating
 
04:22:51.070 --> 04:22:51.080 align:start position:0%
to the 2021 codes in the 2018 codes
 
04:22:53.469 --> 04:22:53.479 align:start position:0%

um the um commission thank you very much
 
04:30:02.910 --> 04:30:02.920 align:start position:0%
um this W this bill um was a request
 
04:30:06.189 --> 04:30:06.199 align:start position:0%
from the EV emergency response Round
 
04:30:08.750 --> 04:30:08.760 align:start position:0%
Table um it's been a discussion I know
 
04:30:09.950 --> 04:30:09.960 align:start position:0%
it's been a discussion at the New
 
04:30:11.710 --> 04:30:11.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Transportation Council when I
 
04:30:13.790 --> 04:30:13.800 align:start position:0%
was member and chair of
 
04:30:15.790 --> 04:30:15.800 align:start position:0%
Transportation um also I went to a
 
04:30:18.590 --> 04:30:18.600 align:start position:0%
couple of the EV uh Round Table meetings
 
04:30:21.349 --> 04:30:21.359 align:start position:0%
and there is a lot of concern from our
 
04:30:24.469 --> 04:30:24.479 align:start position:0%
First Responders on how to handle EV
 
04:30:26.349 --> 04:30:26.359 align:start position:0%
fires and lithium
 
04:30:30.389 --> 04:30:30.399 align:start position:0%
batteries so uh and we just heard a bill
 
04:30:32.990 --> 04:30:33.000 align:start position:0%
a house bill actually in the in Senate
 
04:30:35.910 --> 04:30:35.920 align:start position:0%
energy which I'm a member of as well um
 
04:30:39.149 --> 04:30:39.159 align:start position:0%
on um correct disposal of lithium
 
04:30:42.550 --> 04:30:42.560 align:start position:0%
batteries so this mission is required is
 
04:30:44.510 --> 04:30:44.520 align:start position:0%
required to study the occurrence of
 
04:30:46.750 --> 04:30:46.760 align:start position:0%
electric vehicles lithium ion battery
 
04:30:49.710 --> 04:30:49.720 align:start position:0%
and E Mobility device fire department
 
04:30:51.309 --> 04:30:51.319 align:start position:0%
responses in New Hampshire and I might
 
04:30:53.950 --> 04:30:53.960 align:start position:0%
add I just saw on the news today um
 
04:30:55.269 --> 04:30:55.279 align:start position:0%
there was a
 
04:30:58.790 --> 04:30:58.800 align:start position:0%
spontaneous ebike that um blew up and
 
04:31:01.269 --> 04:31:01.279 align:start position:0%
caught on fire in London and I guess
 
04:31:04.670 --> 04:31:04.680 align:start position:0%
there's been a few in the US as well so
 
04:31:07.030 --> 04:31:07.040 align:start position:0%
that's something to be aware of um it's
 
04:31:08.630 --> 04:31:08.640 align:start position:0%
also going to study the impacts of
 
04:31:10.590 --> 04:31:10.600 align:start position:0%
Public Safety and it's a council it's
 
04:31:12.790 --> 04:31:12.800 align:start position:0%
not a commission
 
04:31:15.469 --> 04:31:15.479 align:start position:0%
um the impacts of Public Safety response
 
04:31:18.070 --> 04:31:18.080 align:start position:0%
and personal protective equipment the
 
04:31:20.790 --> 04:31:20.800 align:start position:0%
impacts to the built environment one of
 
04:31:22.149 --> 04:31:22.159 align:start position:0%
the things that came up in the New
 
04:31:25.870 --> 04:31:25.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Transportation Council when um
 
04:31:28.990 --> 04:31:29.000 align:start position:0%
Victoria Sheen was still our
 
04:31:32.229 --> 04:31:32.239 align:start position:0%
um uh Commissioner of
 
04:31:35.510 --> 04:31:35.520 align:start position:0%
Transportation the discussion was around
 
04:31:39.830 --> 04:31:39.840 align:start position:0%
the EV fires and how hot they burned and
 
04:31:42.990 --> 04:31:43.000 align:start position:0%
her concern came out that okay so what
 
04:31:45.030 --> 04:31:45.040 align:start position:0%
happens if one of these cars catches on
 
04:31:46.309 --> 04:31:46.319 align:start position:0%
fire in the middle of the White
 
04:31:49.389 --> 04:31:49.399 align:start position:0%
Mountains we don't have 4,000 was it
 
04:31:49.399 --> 04:31:50.229 align:start position:0%
Mountains we don't have 4,000 was it
four

04:31:50.229 --> 04:31:50.239 align:start position:0%
four
 
04:31:50.239 --> 04:31:52.149 align:start position:0%
four
4,000

04:31:52.149 --> 04:31:52.159 align:start position:0%
4,000
 
04:31:55.309 --> 04:31:55.319 align:start position:0%
gallons 4,000 gallons or more to put
 
04:31:58.750 --> 04:31:58.760 align:start position:0%
this fire out the the comment was well
 
04:32:00.870 --> 04:32:00.880 align:start position:0%
then you have to let it burn out well at
 
04:32:03.670 --> 04:32:03.680 align:start position:0%
4,000 and whatever however many
 
04:32:05.790 --> 04:32:05.800 align:start position:0%
thousands of degrees it is that means
 
04:32:09.349 --> 04:32:09.359 align:start position:0%
the road is going to melt um wherever
 
04:32:12.670 --> 04:32:12.680 align:start position:0%
that EV is so when we say built
 
04:32:15.950 --> 04:32:15.960 align:start position:0%
environment we um we talk we we're
 
04:32:17.710 --> 04:32:17.720 align:start position:0%
talking about the roads we're also
 
04:32:19.790 --> 04:32:19.800 align:start position:0%
talking about garages that are attached
 
04:32:23.870 --> 04:32:23.880 align:start position:0%
to buildings that have EV Chargers um so
 
04:32:25.710 --> 04:32:25.720 align:start position:0%
that's when when we say built
 
04:32:27.269 --> 04:32:27.279 align:start position:0%
environments that's what we're talking
 
04:32:29.710 --> 04:32:29.720 align:start position:0%
about um the impacts to the environment
 
04:32:32.830 --> 04:32:32.840 align:start position:0%
to include air water ground pollution
 
04:32:34.710 --> 04:32:34.720 align:start position:0%
impacts to the as I said the State
 
04:32:37.630 --> 04:32:37.640 align:start position:0%
Transportation Systems which I just um
 
04:32:39.910 --> 04:32:39.920 align:start position:0%
explained the cost in administration of
 
04:32:42.670 --> 04:32:42.680 align:start position:0%
first responder training and impacts to
 
04:32:45.550 --> 04:32:45.560 align:start position:0%
building and fire codes because that
 
04:32:49.189 --> 04:32:49.199 align:start position:0%
that is one thing that I'm um we had a
 
04:32:52.830 --> 04:32:52.840 align:start position:0%
cond I'm in a condo and their tow houses
 
04:32:55.830 --> 04:32:55.840 align:start position:0%
and are they're four units each with a
 
04:32:58.950 --> 04:32:58.960 align:start position:0%
um Garage in between each unit and I
 
04:33:01.429 --> 04:33:01.439 align:start position:0%
brought it up at our last meeting that
 
04:33:03.990 --> 04:33:04.000 align:start position:0%
we need to start putting some rules in
 
04:33:06.070 --> 04:33:06.080 align:start position:0%
our condos about it because if if
 
04:33:08.590 --> 04:33:08.600 align:start position:0%
someone comes in with and puts a car
 
04:33:11.029 --> 04:33:11.039 align:start position:0%
charger in there that's going to impact
 
04:33:13.349 --> 04:33:13.359 align:start position:0%
us if anything happen happens to it um
 
04:33:15.429 --> 04:33:15.439 align:start position:0%
you can guarantee that all four of those
 
04:33:17.629 --> 04:33:17.639 align:start position:0%
units are going to go up if one of those
 
04:33:19.070 --> 04:33:19.080 align:start position:0%
because they burn at a pretty high rate
 
04:33:24.510 --> 04:33:24.520 align:start position:0%
and pretty fast so um this this uh
 
04:33:26.070 --> 04:33:26.080 align:start position:0%
council is going to be studying those
 
04:33:27.869 --> 04:33:27.879 align:start position:0%
things and I'm sure that's why the Fire
 
04:33:29.750 --> 04:33:29.760 align:start position:0%
Marshall is
 
04:33:34.109 --> 04:33:34.119 align:start position:0%
here so I will entertain any
 
04:33:36.670 --> 04:33:36.680 align:start position:0%
questions okay thank you I'd like to
 
04:33:38.470 --> 04:33:38.480 align:start position:0%
commend you for
 
04:33:42.150 --> 04:33:42.160 align:start position:0%
selecting um your council members that
 
04:33:43.670 --> 04:33:43.680 align:start position:0%
the governor and Council don't have to
 
04:33:46.150 --> 04:33:46.160 align:start position:0%
be involved that that tends to be a
 
04:33:49.189 --> 04:33:49.199 align:start position:0%
delaying Factor you're
 
04:33:52.869 --> 04:33:52.879 align:start position:0%
welcome anyone other questions seeing
 
04:33:55.709 --> 04:33:55.719 align:start position:0%
none thank you not
 
04:34:06.990 --> 04:34:07.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:09.910 --> 04:34:09.920 align:start position:0%
toi good afternoon Sean Tumi State Fire
 
04:34:12.830 --> 04:34:12.840 align:start position:0%
Marshall um
 
04:34:14.789 --> 04:34:14.799 align:start position:0%
so I think Senator Bell did a great job
 
04:34:17.551 --> 04:34:17.561 align:start position:0%
introducing the bill um I can tell you
 
04:34:21.349 --> 04:34:21.359 align:start position:0%
that the uh our office um started some
 
04:34:23.390 --> 04:34:23.400 align:start position:0%
sort of Round Table discussions if you
 
04:34:25.551 --> 04:34:25.561 align:start position:0%
will this summer um and trying to bring
 
04:34:27.429 --> 04:34:27.439 align:start position:0%
stakeholders together uh from the
 
04:34:29.869 --> 04:34:29.879 align:start position:0%
different disciplines just to talk about
 
04:34:33.109 --> 04:34:33.119 align:start position:0%
the hazards uh and any concerns around
 
04:34:34.949 --> 04:34:34.959 align:start position:0%
electric vehicle fires and lithium ion
 
04:34:36.990 --> 04:34:37.000 align:start position:0%
battery fires and trying to figure out
 
04:34:39.510 --> 04:34:39.520 align:start position:0%
how to educate um the the fire service
 
04:34:40.990 --> 04:34:41.000 align:start position:0%
and First Responders we include law
 
04:34:42.230 --> 04:34:42.240 align:start position:0%
enforcement as well on this because
 
04:34:43.709 --> 04:34:43.719 align:start position:0%
they'll be responding to some of these
 
04:34:47.150 --> 04:34:47.160 align:start position:0%
incidents um and and trying to figure
 
04:34:50.070 --> 04:34:50.080 align:start position:0%
out Outreach to the consumers as well um
 
04:34:52.429 --> 04:34:52.439 align:start position:0%
we're not looking to block any of these
 
04:34:54.429 --> 04:34:54.439 align:start position:0%
devices they're here we have them I have
 
04:34:55.551 --> 04:34:55.561 align:start position:0%
two phones on me they both have
 
04:34:57.869 --> 04:34:57.879 align:start position:0%
batteries in them um you know but I
 
04:35:00.470 --> 04:35:00.480 align:start position:0%
think the education and being thoughtful
 
04:35:03.390 --> 04:35:03.400 align:start position:0%
about uh how to handle them and and
 
04:35:05.830 --> 04:35:05.840 align:start position:0%
making any necessary changes to codes
 
04:35:09.310 --> 04:35:09.320 align:start position:0%
and and practice make sense so uh
 
04:35:12.109 --> 04:35:12.119 align:start position:0%
Senator Birdsell was kind enough to work
 
04:35:14.910 --> 04:35:14.920 align:start position:0%
with us to um sponsor this bill really
 
04:35:16.551 --> 04:35:16.561 align:start position:0%
to bring together we had asked initially
 
04:35:18.390 --> 04:35:18.400 align:start position:0%
was a commission change to council but
 
04:35:21.189 --> 04:35:21.199 align:start position:0%
just sort of formalize the group that we
 
04:35:23.670 --> 04:35:23.680 align:start position:0%
developed the suar hopefully to get the
 
04:35:25.189 --> 04:35:25.199 align:start position:0%
bulk of the stakeholders that would be
 
04:35:28.029 --> 04:35:28.039 align:start position:0%
involved and um bring forth the report
 
04:35:29.670 --> 04:35:29.680 align:start position:0%
preliminary report in November of this
 
04:35:31.230 --> 04:35:31.240 align:start position:0%
year and a final report following
 
04:35:35.310 --> 04:35:35.320 align:start position:0%
November to um recommend any changes uh
 
04:35:37.590 --> 04:35:37.600 align:start position:0%
if necessary to around the areas of
 
04:35:39.150 --> 04:35:39.160 align:start position:0%
electric vehicle fires and lithium
 
04:35:42.070 --> 04:35:42.080 align:start position:0%
battery fires um as far as electric
 
04:35:44.709 --> 04:35:44.719 align:start position:0%
vehicle fires we have 3 or 400 car fires
 
04:35:46.750 --> 04:35:46.760 align:start position:0%
in the state a year we think there's
 
04:35:49.029 --> 04:35:49.039 align:start position:0%
only been uh two or three electric
 
04:35:52.070 --> 04:35:52.080 align:start position:0%
vehicle Fires at this point um so the
 
04:35:54.709 --> 04:35:54.719 align:start position:0%
occurrence isn't huge uh but when they
 
04:35:57.910 --> 04:35:57.920 align:start position:0%
do occur they typically are much more uh
 
04:36:00.310 --> 04:36:00.320 align:start position:0%
intensive as far as resourc driven for
 
04:36:02.750 --> 04:36:02.760 align:start position:0%
uh the Water Supply uh just to put them
 
04:36:07.551 --> 04:36:07.561 align:start position:0%
out um the the e-mobility type devices
 
04:36:09.750 --> 04:36:09.760 align:start position:0%
are susceptible to Thermal thermal
 
04:36:11.070 --> 04:36:11.080 align:start position:0%
Runway if they're typically if they're
 
04:36:12.910 --> 04:36:12.920 align:start position:0%
damaged mismatch with devices for
 
04:36:15.390 --> 04:36:15.400 align:start position:0%
charging and things like that and we're
 
04:36:16.990 --> 04:36:17.000 align:start position:0%
you know especially concerned about
 
04:36:19.390 --> 04:36:19.400 align:start position:0%
educating consumers about using listed
 
04:36:21.709 --> 04:36:21.719 align:start position:0%
devices um charging with appropriate
 
04:36:23.709 --> 04:36:23.719 align:start position:0%
equipment and you know following
 
04:36:25.269 --> 04:36:25.279 align:start position:0%
manufacturers and recommendations when
 
04:36:27.230 --> 04:36:27.240 align:start position:0%
they're in use uh so we've been pushing
 
04:36:28.910 --> 04:36:28.920 align:start position:0%
a lot of that information messaging and
 
04:36:30.590 --> 04:36:30.600 align:start position:0%
stuff through our social media outlets
 
04:36:33.789 --> 04:36:33.799 align:start position:0%
and and such but um if they do have a
 
04:36:35.910 --> 04:36:35.920 align:start position:0%
fire you know as as a center di mention
 
04:36:38.670 --> 04:36:38.680 align:start position:0%
like in a condo situation um especially
 
04:36:41.070 --> 04:36:41.080 align:start position:0%
more like an apartment buildings we want
 
04:36:43.670 --> 04:36:43.680 align:start position:0%
uh you know put store them store them in
 
04:36:45.189 --> 04:36:45.199 align:start position:0%
the appropriate places don't put them in
 
04:36:47.230 --> 04:36:47.240 align:start position:0%
the means of egress and things like that
 
04:36:52.470 --> 04:36:52.480 align:start position:0%
there was a a fire in um uh term at UNH
 
04:36:55.470 --> 04:36:55.480 align:start position:0%
earlier this year it was a makeshift uh
 
04:36:58.310 --> 04:36:58.320 align:start position:0%
ebike uh that had a fire in one of the
 
04:37:00.470 --> 04:37:00.480 align:start position:0%
dorms fortunately there was no uh
 
04:37:02.789 --> 04:37:02.799 align:start position:0%
injuries or um anything but you know
 
04:37:04.070 --> 04:37:04.080 align:start position:0%
that those are things we need to think
 
04:37:06.789 --> 04:37:06.799 align:start position:0%
about so um I guess our ask for you is
 
04:37:09.070 --> 04:37:09.080 align:start position:0%
just to help formalize that group and
 
04:37:11.109 --> 04:37:11.119 align:start position:0%
then for us to you know for us to bring
 
04:37:13.189 --> 04:37:13.199 align:start position:0%
back our our task be bring back any
 
04:37:14.869 --> 04:37:14.879 align:start position:0%
recommendations there's a lot of
 
04:37:17.470 --> 04:37:17.480 align:start position:0%
national National interest at this point
 
04:37:19.230 --> 04:37:19.240 align:start position:0%
on the code side and the fire service
 
04:37:21.750 --> 04:37:21.760 align:start position:0%
side studying this uh Underwriters Labs
 
04:37:23.789 --> 04:37:23.799 align:start position:0%
or UL has got a big has funded a big
 
04:37:25.510 --> 04:37:25.520 align:start position:0%
study through the fire service research
 
04:37:28.150 --> 04:37:28.160 align:start position:0%
institute NFPA who does the fire codes
 
04:37:29.750 --> 04:37:29.760 align:start position:0%
is they through their Research
 
04:37:31.990 --> 04:37:32.000 align:start position:0%
Foundation is devoted a bunch of stuff
 
04:37:33.990 --> 04:37:34.000 align:start position:0%
and then ICC who does our building codes
 
04:37:36.189 --> 04:37:36.199 align:start position:0%
it's got an ad hoc committee uh working
 
04:37:38.230 --> 04:37:38.240 align:start position:0%
to look at the building code so we're
 
04:37:40.269 --> 04:37:40.279 align:start position:0%
you know we're looking to them and their
 
04:37:42.109 --> 04:37:42.119 align:start position:0%
expertise as well to guide us a little
 
04:37:44.310 --> 04:37:44.320 align:start position:0%
bit on some of this so happy to try to
 
04:37:47.670 --> 04:37:47.680 align:start position:0%
answer any questions thank you repres
 
04:37:50.789 --> 04:37:50.799 align:start position:0%
and then Dolan Andi thank you madam
 
04:37:52.709 --> 04:37:52.719 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for taking my question I
 
04:37:55.551 --> 04:37:55.561 align:start position:0%
have two uh questions one you did
 
04:37:58.269 --> 04:37:58.279 align:start position:0%
mention about the phones and the
 
04:38:01.670 --> 04:38:01.680 align:start position:0%
batteries are here and we just heard the
 
04:38:06.230 --> 04:38:06.240 align:start position:0%
laptop catching fire in next state over
 
04:38:09.150 --> 04:38:09.160 align:start position:0%
so are we going you know we can't ban
 
04:38:12.551 --> 04:38:12.561 align:start position:0%
everything so how do we deal with that
 
04:38:15.349 --> 04:38:15.359 align:start position:0%
um batteries are here to stay and the
 
04:38:16.830 --> 04:38:16.840 align:start position:0%
Technologies are
 
04:38:22.910 --> 04:38:22.920 align:start position:0%
changing my second part to it is how are
 
04:38:26.510 --> 04:38:26.520 align:start position:0%
other states that have EV infrastructure
 
04:38:30.590 --> 04:38:30.600 align:start position:0%
and EV vehicles are dealing with that as
 
04:38:32.230 --> 04:38:32.240 align:start position:0%
the technology
 
04:38:35.629 --> 04:38:35.639 align:start position:0%
changes and uh how is New Hampshire
 
04:38:37.029 --> 04:38:37.039 align:start position:0%
keeping up with
 
04:38:39.629 --> 04:38:39.639 align:start position:0%
that I think we're behind a little bit
 
04:38:41.551 --> 04:38:41.561 align:start position:0%
on some of the other the advancement of
 
04:38:43.670 --> 04:38:43.680 align:start position:0%
EV technology in our state I I don't
 
04:38:45.109 --> 04:38:45.119 align:start position:0%
have the numbers off the top of my head
 
04:38:47.029 --> 04:38:47.039 align:start position:0%
right now the number of EVS that we have
 
04:38:48.709 --> 04:38:48.719 align:start position:0%
but compared to other states I know
 
04:38:51.910 --> 04:38:51.920 align:start position:0%
we're we're behind a bit right um our
 
04:38:54.390 --> 04:38:54.400 align:start position:0%
Curren of fires are much less but I
 
04:38:57.789 --> 04:38:57.799 align:start position:0%
think that um they are here to stay I
 
04:38:59.470 --> 04:38:59.480 align:start position:0%
think the good news is there's a lot of
 
04:39:01.789 --> 04:39:01.799 align:start position:0%
work going on science to try to change
 
04:39:03.109 --> 04:39:03.119 align:start position:0%
the batteries and the stability of the
 
04:39:06.470 --> 04:39:06.480 align:start position:0%
batteries which will help um but I think
 
04:39:08.750 --> 04:39:08.760 align:start position:0%
we I think my focus is really on the
 
04:39:11.349 --> 04:39:11.359 align:start position:0%
education consumer education and making
 
04:39:13.590 --> 04:39:13.600 align:start position:0%
you know making sure that uh we have
 
04:39:16.429 --> 04:39:16.439 align:start position:0%
that information that's out there but um
 
04:39:18.869 --> 04:39:18.879 align:start position:0%
we want we want to watch the numbers we
 
04:39:21.949 --> 04:39:21.959 align:start position:0%
don't want to overreact to you
 
04:39:23.869 --> 04:39:23.879 align:start position:0%
there one
 
04:39:26.869 --> 04:39:26.879 align:start position:0%
followup thank you so how will this
 
04:39:31.310 --> 04:39:31.320 align:start position:0%
impact are tourism the tra uh tourists
 
04:39:33.551 --> 04:39:33.561 align:start position:0%
from outside of the state they're using
 
04:39:34.949 --> 04:39:34.959 align:start position:0%
more and more
 
04:39:37.948 --> 04:39:37.958 align:start position:0%
EV how will this Council impact tourism
 
04:39:40.110 --> 04:39:40.120 align:start position:0%
not Council if we don't have the
 
04:39:41.948 --> 04:39:41.958 align:start position:0%
infrastructure if we don't have the
 
04:39:44.948 --> 04:39:44.958 align:start position:0%
charging station if you don't encourage
 
04:39:47.030 --> 04:39:47.040 align:start position:0%
that um representative maner py that's
 
04:39:49.350 --> 04:39:49.360 align:start position:0%
totally beyond the scope of this this
 
04:39:49.360 --> 04:39:52.788 align:start position:0%
totally beyond the scope of this this
this

04:39:52.788 --> 04:39:52.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:54.990 --> 04:39:55.000 align:start position:0%
council do you have a question that's
 
04:39:56.750 --> 04:39:56.760 align:start position:0%
related to The
 
04:40:00.390 --> 04:40:00.400 align:start position:0%
Bill yes so the council is looking at
 
04:40:01.590 --> 04:40:01.600 align:start position:0%
how to
 
04:40:07.948 --> 04:40:07.958 align:start position:0%
address the EV and the fire and what it
 
04:40:11.470 --> 04:40:11.480 align:start position:0%
takes so how that impacts if you don't
 
04:40:14.788 --> 04:40:14.798 align:start position:0%
look at it and find a solution we may
 
04:40:17.270 --> 04:40:17.280 align:start position:0%
not have EVS in our state but how will
 
04:40:20.270 --> 04:40:20.280 align:start position:0%
it affect the Travelers that come to our
 
04:40:23.390 --> 04:40:23.400 align:start position:0%
state if you don't have well I suspect
 
04:40:25.788 --> 04:40:25.798 align:start position:0%
that if the uh this commission finds
 
04:40:28.628 --> 04:40:28.638 align:start position:0%
that EV Chargers are a major fire hazard
 
04:40:29.830 --> 04:40:29.840 align:start position:0%
which I don't think they're going to
 
04:40:32.150 --> 04:40:32.160 align:start position:0%
find but if they do then we would not
 
04:40:34.350 --> 04:40:34.360 align:start position:0%
build anymore we would not allow anyone
 
04:40:36.910 --> 04:40:36.920 align:start position:0%
to build anymore and we would warn
 
04:40:39.590 --> 04:40:39.600 align:start position:0%
people not to bring your EVS into New
 
04:40:41.910 --> 04:40:41.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I mean that would be
 
04:40:44.708 --> 04:40:44.718 align:start position:0%
the worst case or the best case
 
04:40:46.230 --> 04:40:46.240 align:start position:0%
depending on how you thought about it
 
04:40:48.628 --> 04:40:48.638 align:start position:0%
but that would be one
 
04:40:48.638 --> 04:40:50.510 align:start position:0%
but that would be one
extreme

04:40:50.510 --> 04:40:50.520 align:start position:0%
extreme
 
04:40:57.030 --> 04:40:57.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:58.990 --> 04:40:59.000 align:start position:0%
mind yeah I don't know I'm not sure how
 
04:41:00.430 --> 04:41:00.440 align:start position:0%
to quite answer I think that's outside
 
04:41:02.910 --> 04:41:02.920 align:start position:0%
the scope of what we were looking at but
 
04:41:05.430 --> 04:41:05.440 align:start position:0%
okay representative dlan had a question
 
04:41:07.070 --> 04:41:07.080 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you for
 
04:41:09.510 --> 04:41:09.520 align:start position:0%
taking my question this so this question
 
04:41:12.150 --> 04:41:12.160 align:start position:0%
is um
 
04:41:14.310 --> 04:41:14.320 align:start position:0%
might the answer might be that's why
 
04:41:15.830 --> 04:41:15.840 align:start position:0%
they we're going to do the study and
 
04:41:18.708 --> 04:41:18.718 align:start position:0%
that the question is uh with lithium
 
04:41:18.718 --> 04:41:20.070 align:start position:0%
that the question is uh with lithium
iron

04:41:20.070 --> 04:41:20.080 align:start position:0%
iron
 
04:41:20.080 --> 04:41:23.150 align:start position:0%
iron
batteries

04:41:23.150 --> 04:41:23.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:28.708 --> 04:41:28.718 align:start position:0%
U is there any uh consideration of not
 
04:41:33.190 --> 04:41:33.200 align:start position:0%
allowing those EVS to to be parked in
 
04:41:35.590 --> 04:41:35.600 align:start position:0%
parking garages where a fire could start
 
04:41:37.628 --> 04:41:37.638 align:start position:0%
and not be able to be put out or is that
 
04:41:38.830 --> 04:41:38.840 align:start position:0%
something that you're going to be
 
04:41:42.470 --> 04:41:42.480 align:start position:0%
studying with this bill uh I think the
 
04:41:44.390 --> 04:41:44.400 align:start position:0%
the impacts to building of fire codes is
 
04:41:46.150 --> 04:41:46.160 align:start position:0%
what we were looking at so that would be
 
04:41:49.230 --> 04:41:49.240 align:start position:0%
probably uh connected to that there's
 
04:41:50.830 --> 04:41:50.840 align:start position:0%
there are studies nationally that are
 
04:41:52.830 --> 04:41:52.840 align:start position:0%
going on that looking at the parking
 
04:41:55.590 --> 04:41:55.600 align:start position:0%
garages parking garage fires in general
 
04:41:58.390 --> 04:41:58.400 align:start position:0%
right now because the data what we've
 
04:42:00.868 --> 04:42:00.878 align:start position:0%
learned the the the design fires and
 
04:42:03.070 --> 04:42:03.080 align:start position:0%
such for parking garages and car fires
 
04:42:04.948 --> 04:42:04.958 align:start position:0%
is based on car fires from the 70s and
 
04:42:07.070 --> 04:42:07.080 align:start position:0%
80s and now that we've introduced
 
04:42:09.628 --> 04:42:09.638 align:start position:0%
Plastics into all of our cars that's a
 
04:42:10.750 --> 04:42:10.760 align:start position:0%
very different fire than what the
 
04:42:13.390 --> 04:42:13.400 align:start position:0%
designs are anyway so um you know I
 
04:42:15.270 --> 04:42:15.280 align:start position:0%
think that the car fires in parking
 
04:42:17.350 --> 04:42:17.360 align:start position:0%
garages in general is being studied not
 
04:42:20.590 --> 04:42:20.600 align:start position:0%
only because of EVS so um all of that
 
04:42:22.868 --> 04:42:22.878 align:start position:0%
data will be I would Envision being
 
04:42:26.830 --> 04:42:26.840 align:start position:0%
incorporated as part of this um
 
04:42:29.310 --> 04:42:29.320 align:start position:0%
Council representative
 
04:42:32.150 --> 04:42:32.160 align:start position:0%
sh thank you madam chair well I mean
 
04:42:34.430 --> 04:42:34.440 align:start position:0%
we're all aware that we're most of us
 
04:42:37.390 --> 04:42:37.400 align:start position:0%
are driving around in vehicles that are
 
04:42:41.510 --> 04:42:41.520 align:start position:0%
potential explosive bombs right we got
 
04:42:45.230 --> 04:42:45.240 align:start position:0%
20 gallons or however many gallons you
 
04:42:49.628 --> 04:42:49.638 align:start position:0%
got in your tank you know that uh
 
04:42:51.750 --> 04:42:51.760 align:start position:0%
carfire is not a nice thing no matter
 
04:42:54.190 --> 04:42:54.200 align:start position:0%
what the heck you're powering it with uh
 
04:42:57.788 --> 04:42:57.798 align:start position:0%
but the bottom line is uh that we have
 
04:43:01.150 --> 04:43:01.160 align:start position:0%
all these devices they're here to stay
 
04:43:02.990 --> 04:43:03.000 align:start position:0%
maybe the batteries will be completely
 
04:43:06.910 --> 04:43:06.920 align:start position:0%
redesigned but the the the question I
 
04:43:09.708 --> 04:43:09.718 align:start position:0%
have is there's no fiscal
 
04:43:13.030 --> 04:43:13.040 align:start position:0%
note uh but it's go I you're going to
 
04:43:15.550 --> 04:43:15.560 align:start position:0%
have to do some research I presume that
 
04:43:18.190 --> 04:43:18.200 align:start position:0%
you're I didn't look to see are you the
 
04:43:20.430 --> 04:43:20.440 align:start position:0%
head of it or I I learned I am the head
 
04:43:22.030 --> 04:43:22.040 align:start position:0%
of it I'm going to be the chair of this
 
04:43:24.510 --> 04:43:24.520 align:start position:0%
I I think that happened in the amendment
 
04:43:27.150 --> 04:43:27.160 align:start position:0%
but that's fine the design yeah I'm good
 
04:43:29.830 --> 04:43:29.840 align:start position:0%
with that uh so this this is all good
 
04:43:32.270 --> 04:43:32.280 align:start position:0%
but I'm just kind of a secondary
 
04:43:34.708 --> 04:43:34.718 align:start position:0%
question is I mean we have UNH over
 
04:43:35.868 --> 04:43:35.878 align:start position:0%
there with
 
04:43:39.948 --> 04:43:39.958 align:start position:0%
chemists uh scientists uh physicists and
 
04:43:41.708 --> 04:43:41.718 align:start position:0%
so forth and so on
 
04:43:44.670 --> 04:43:44.680 align:start position:0%
uh uh are we looking at whether we have
 
04:43:46.910 --> 04:43:46.920 align:start position:0%
some homegrown research so that we're
 
04:43:48.430 --> 04:43:48.440 align:start position:0%
not completely dependent on what they're
 
04:43:50.628 --> 04:43:50.638 align:start position:0%
doing down in Massachusetts or
 
04:43:52.670 --> 04:43:52.680 align:start position:0%
California or wherever where they've got
 
04:43:54.190 --> 04:43:54.200 align:start position:0%
many times our
 
04:43:56.430 --> 04:43:56.440 align:start position:0%
population I I believe we have a pretty
 
04:43:58.030 --> 04:43:58.040 align:start position:0%
good representation in the group that we
 
04:43:59.708 --> 04:43:59.718 align:start position:0%
identified auto dealers the tow
 
04:44:02.948 --> 04:44:02.958 align:start position:0%
associations the fire chiefs Dees dot
 
04:44:04.550 --> 04:44:04.560 align:start position:0%
like I mean we have I think we have a
 
04:44:06.510 --> 04:44:06.520 align:start position:0%
good mix and then you know it does talk
 
04:44:08.390 --> 04:44:08.400 align:start position:0%
about being able to bring in others so I
 
04:44:10.750 --> 04:44:10.760 align:start position:0%
think we have I think between what we
 
04:44:13.750 --> 04:44:13.760 align:start position:0%
have and tapping into a few friends
 
04:44:15.390 --> 04:44:15.400 align:start position:0%
around we I think we'll be in pretty
 
04:44:17.470 --> 04:44:17.480 align:start position:0%
good shape it's my guess thank you thank
 
04:44:20.510 --> 04:44:20.520 align:start position:0%
you B blackis yeah this is uh I think a
 
04:44:21.788 --> 04:44:21.798 align:start position:0%
question for the chair whoever can
 
04:44:23.910 --> 04:44:23.920 align:start position:0%
answer it what what's the uh sort of
 
04:44:26.030 --> 04:44:26.040 align:start position:0%
technical def difference between a
 
04:44:28.430 --> 04:44:28.440 align:start position:0%
council and a commission and a committee
 
04:44:30.230 --> 04:44:30.240 align:start position:0%
committee commission I think I I know
 
04:44:32.910 --> 04:44:32.920 align:start position:0%
what a committee is that's legislators
 
04:44:33.868 --> 04:44:33.878 align:start position:0%
what's the difference do you know the
 
04:44:34.948 --> 04:44:34.958 align:start position:0%
difference between a council and a
 
04:44:36.990 --> 04:44:37.000 align:start position:0%
commission I don't so my understand we
 
04:44:38.470 --> 04:44:38.480 align:start position:0%
came at it with a commission which would
 
04:44:41.350 --> 04:44:41.360 align:start position:0%
have had um a couple of reps on it and
 
04:44:44.110 --> 04:44:44.120 align:start position:0%
and Senator on it and then what we
 
04:44:47.550 --> 04:44:47.560 align:start position:0%
learned from recent changes is that the
 
04:44:49.868 --> 04:44:49.878 align:start position:0%
the commissions it has to be made up of
 
04:44:51.390 --> 04:44:51.400 align:start position:0%
more members of the general court than
 
04:44:53.190 --> 04:44:53.200 align:start position:0%
there are people on the committee y I
 
04:44:55.310 --> 04:44:55.320 align:start position:0%
remember that um and this as council is
 
04:44:58.030 --> 04:44:58.040 align:start position:0%
new I don't know as amended it has no
 
04:45:00.550 --> 04:45:00.560 align:start position:0%
members of the legislature yes yes thank
 
04:45:03.948 --> 04:45:03.958 align:start position:0%
you for you talk to us and explain what
 
04:45:06.628 --> 04:45:06.638 align:start position:0%
we'll read your uh reports and uh take
 
04:45:09.030 --> 04:45:09.040 align:start position:0%
action if necessary yeah okay
 
04:45:11.948 --> 04:45:11.958 align:start position:0%
representative Shu and then Brown
 
04:45:13.948 --> 04:45:13.958 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you Fire
 
04:45:16.550 --> 04:45:16.560 align:start position:0%
Marshall um and I'm not sure if this is
 
04:45:19.430 --> 04:45:19.440 align:start position:0%
too appropriate but I'm just curious if
 
04:45:22.788 --> 04:45:22.798 align:start position:0%
you know if you can tell us do these
 
04:45:25.350 --> 04:45:25.360 align:start position:0%
fires start because of the lithium
 
04:45:28.310 --> 04:45:28.320 align:start position:0%
battery because of the charger the
 
04:45:31.110 --> 04:45:31.120 align:start position:0%
connection between the two or is it like
 
04:45:32.510 --> 04:45:32.520 align:start position:0%
all of the
 
04:45:34.550 --> 04:45:34.560 align:start position:0%
above typically it's some sort of
 
04:45:38.430 --> 04:45:38.440 align:start position:0%
failure mechanism um in the cars it's
 
04:45:40.510 --> 04:45:40.520 align:start position:0%
usually typically some sort of damage or
 
04:45:40.520 --> 04:45:41.510 align:start position:0%
usually typically some sort of damage or
some

04:45:41.510 --> 04:45:41.520 align:start position:0%
some
 
04:45:43.948 --> 04:45:43.958 align:start position:0%
impurity and type thing in the batter is
 
04:45:45.470 --> 04:45:45.480 align:start position:0%
seems to be what the thing is and then
 
04:45:47.590 --> 04:45:47.600 align:start position:0%
it causes thermal Runway which causes
 
04:45:51.550 --> 04:45:51.560 align:start position:0%
the the fire event so um I don't the
 
04:45:53.430 --> 04:45:53.440 align:start position:0%
charger itself doesn't seem to be the
 
04:45:56.070 --> 04:45:56.080 align:start position:0%
culprit most of the times but it can
 
04:46:00.070 --> 04:46:00.080 align:start position:0%
happen right um so um it's usually a
 
04:46:01.910 --> 04:46:01.920 align:start position:0%
damage or an impurity type thing is what
 
04:46:03.550 --> 04:46:03.560 align:start position:0%
most of them seem to be coming at this
 
04:46:05.190 --> 04:46:05.200 align:start position:0%
point but we're still learning a lot
 
04:46:07.510 --> 04:46:07.520 align:start position:0%
right and that's I think we'll continue
 
04:46:09.550 --> 04:46:09.560 align:start position:0%
to learn a bit for a
 
04:46:12.030 --> 04:46:12.040 align:start position:0%
while Brown you had a question uh yes
 
04:46:13.390 --> 04:46:13.400 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair uh thanks for
 
04:46:15.590 --> 04:46:15.600 align:start position:0%
taking my question I think it doesn't
 
04:46:18.350 --> 04:46:18.360 align:start position:0%
say this specifically but should this
 
04:46:21.230 --> 04:46:21.240 align:start position:0%
apply to um solar systems and the
 
04:46:23.510 --> 04:46:23.520 align:start position:0%
batteries and houses and you could
 
04:46:25.030 --> 04:46:25.040 align:start position:0%
probably just go there anyway but it
 
04:46:27.110 --> 04:46:27.120 align:start position:0%
doesn't say that
 
04:46:27.120 --> 04:46:29.708 align:start position:0%
doesn't say that
specifically

04:46:29.708 --> 04:46:29.718 align:start position:0%
specifically
 
04:46:32.830 --> 04:46:32.840 align:start position:0%
um we could probably lump that in on
 
04:46:34.510 --> 04:46:34.520 align:start position:0%
lithium biome batteries and impacts on
 
04:46:35.430 --> 04:46:35.440 align:start position:0%
the building
 
04:46:38.270 --> 04:46:38.280 align:start position:0%
codes um without too much of a stretch I
 
04:46:38.280 --> 04:46:39.830 align:start position:0%
codes um without too much of a stretch I
would

04:46:39.830 --> 04:46:39.840 align:start position:0%
would
 
04:46:39.840 --> 04:46:41.670 align:start position:0%
would
say

04:46:41.670 --> 04:46:41.680 align:start position:0%
say
 
04:46:43.750 --> 04:46:43.760 align:start position:0%
follow Madam chair thank you I know uh
 
04:46:45.548 --> 04:46:45.558 align:start position:0%
my neighbors have a battery system that
 
04:46:47.230 --> 04:46:47.240 align:start position:0%
will last them for seven days to run
 
04:46:48.430 --> 04:46:48.440 align:start position:0%
everything in their
 
04:46:52.390 --> 04:46:52.400 align:start position:0%
house and um but so I'm assuming that
 
04:46:54.510 --> 04:46:54.520 align:start position:0%
those could be a pretty good source of
 
04:46:56.708 --> 04:46:56.718 align:start position:0%
uh some heat if they were a fire in the
 
04:46:58.830 --> 04:46:58.840 align:start position:0%
home so enough said thank
 
04:47:01.350 --> 04:47:01.360 align:start position:0%
you good
 
04:47:07.470 --> 04:47:07.480 align:start position:0%
point any anyone else yes ah repr of
 
04:47:10.190 --> 04:47:10.200 align:start position:0%
Gard than matter CH just quick question
 
04:47:12.390 --> 04:47:12.400 align:start position:0%
for you as as far as because I've seen
 
04:47:14.390 --> 04:47:14.400 align:start position:0%
some video online of electric cars
 
04:47:15.910 --> 04:47:15.920 align:start position:0%
hitting each other and the explosions
 
04:47:18.708 --> 04:47:18.718 align:start position:0%
it's pretty intense the the amount you
 
04:47:19.990 --> 04:47:20.000 align:start position:0%
said there's only three I believe
 
04:47:21.990 --> 04:47:22.000 align:start position:0%
electric car accidents or vehicle
 
04:47:24.150 --> 04:47:24.160 align:start position:0%
collisions or fires I'm sorry yeah is
 
04:47:25.548 --> 04:47:25.558 align:start position:0%
that due maybe you don't know I'm just
 
04:47:27.628 --> 04:47:27.638 align:start position:0%
curious is that due to the technology on
 
04:47:29.270 --> 04:47:29.280 align:start position:0%
these cars that stops collisions like
 
04:47:31.190 --> 04:47:31.200 align:start position:0%
the self-driving aspect or is that just
 
04:47:33.070 --> 04:47:33.080 align:start position:0%
chance or is it just you don't know the
 
04:47:35.470 --> 04:47:35.480 align:start position:0%
two of them are involved in accidents um
 
04:47:37.750 --> 04:47:37.760 align:start position:0%
and I'm not sure quite about the third
 
04:47:39.590 --> 04:47:39.600 align:start position:0%
um is what happened but beyond that the
 
04:47:41.390 --> 04:47:41.400 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire ones I don't know
 
04:47:43.270 --> 04:47:43.280 align:start position:0%
okay I mean I as I say I mean the when
 
04:47:44.708 --> 04:47:44.718 align:start position:0%
you look at some of the data like even
 
04:47:46.390 --> 04:47:46.400 align:start position:0%
on Tesla and stuff when you really drill
 
04:47:48.430 --> 04:47:48.440 align:start position:0%
into it some of them are crashing into
 
04:47:50.070 --> 04:47:50.080 align:start position:0%
things right so cars when they crash
 
04:47:51.830 --> 04:47:51.840 align:start position:0%
into things Catch Fire unfortunately we
 
04:47:54.910 --> 04:47:54.920 align:start position:0%
had the the death yesterday in in um in
 
04:47:57.110 --> 04:47:57.120 align:start position:0%
B right unfor the motorcycle there was a
 
04:47:59.110 --> 04:47:59.120 align:start position:0%
fire involved in that right I we it
 
04:48:00.628 --> 04:48:00.638 align:start position:0%
seems like every year we have someone
 
04:48:03.190 --> 04:48:03.200 align:start position:0%
that crashes a car into a tree or or the
 
04:48:05.750 --> 04:48:05.760 align:start position:0%
um the toll boost or something like that
 
04:48:09.548 --> 04:48:09.558 align:start position:0%
and it catches fire so uh I think that
 
04:48:11.270 --> 04:48:11.280 align:start position:0%
that unfortunately that current those
 
04:48:14.868 --> 04:48:14.878 align:start position:0%
accidents do happen Okay thank you yeah
 
04:48:14.878 --> 04:48:16.030 align:start position:0%
accidents do happen Okay thank you yeah
okay

04:48:16.030 --> 04:48:16.040 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:48:19.590 --> 04:48:19.600 align:start position:0%
represent thank you um thank you chair
 
04:48:23.030 --> 04:48:23.040 align:start position:0%
um Mr Fire Marshall is
 
04:48:27.628 --> 04:48:27.638 align:start position:0%
the the scope of the of the study do you
 
04:48:30.548 --> 04:48:30.558 align:start position:0%
feel that there's enough time within a
 
04:48:34.750 --> 04:48:34.760 align:start position:0%
year to do all these things I hope so
 
04:48:37.510 --> 04:48:37.520 align:start position:0%
that I mean it's a pretty hefty
 
04:48:39.750 --> 04:48:39.760 align:start position:0%
lift I think we'll get some preliminary
 
04:48:41.230 --> 04:48:41.240 align:start position:0%
information out and then I think that's
 
04:48:42.750 --> 04:48:42.760 align:start position:0%
why it gives us another year to get us
 
04:48:44.470 --> 04:48:44.480 align:start position:0%
hopefully get some more information is
 
04:48:47.628 --> 04:48:47.638 align:start position:0%
is my hope um you know will we solve it
 
04:48:49.350 --> 04:48:49.360 align:start position:0%
all probably not but I think we'll we'll
 
04:48:52.788 --> 04:48:52.798 align:start position:0%
have a better sense um okay you we we'll
 
04:48:54.310 --> 04:48:54.320 align:start position:0%
have a better sense within that time
 
04:48:56.030 --> 04:48:56.040 align:start position:0%
representative laus yep there's uh two
 
04:48:57.628 --> 04:48:57.638 align:start position:0%
deadlines one do at the end of this year
 
04:49:01.948 --> 04:49:01.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:05.590 --> 04:49:05.600 align:start position:0%
yeah okay anyone
 
04:49:09.190 --> 04:49:09.200 align:start position:0%
else all right thank you very much thank
 
04:49:21.750 --> 04:49:21.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:24.350 --> 04:49:24.360 align:start position:0%
oler good afternoon Rebecca erer
 
04:49:26.110 --> 04:49:26.120 align:start position:0%
Department of Environmental Services I'm
 
04:49:28.350 --> 04:49:28.360 align:start position:0%
in the air Resources Division uh the
 
04:49:29.868 --> 04:49:29.878 align:start position:0%
department is very supportive of this
 
04:49:32.110 --> 04:49:32.120 align:start position:0%
bill we look forward to taking the
 
04:49:35.548 --> 04:49:35.558 align:start position:0%
opportunity to get more data um I I was
 
04:49:37.270 --> 04:49:37.280 align:start position:0%
hoping that I could get a response to to
 
04:49:38.750 --> 04:49:38.760 align:start position:0%
a text to tell you exactly how many
 
04:49:41.070 --> 04:49:41.080 align:start position:0%
electric vehicles we have register in
 
04:49:43.470 --> 04:49:43.480 align:start position:0%
the state but my best guess is going to
 
04:49:46.470 --> 04:49:46.480 align:start position:0%
be in the 1800 to
 
04:49:50.390 --> 04:49:50.400 align:start position:0%
2000 um range right now but it's
 
04:49:52.750 --> 04:49:52.760 align:start position:0%
certainly growing we we're seeing the
 
04:49:56.670 --> 04:49:56.680 align:start position:0%
the rate of EV adoption grow um at an
 
04:49:59.868 --> 04:49:59.878 align:start position:0%
accelerating rate I I myself own an EV
 
04:50:03.150 --> 04:50:03.160 align:start position:0%
so um you know obviously from an air
 
04:50:05.470 --> 04:50:05.480 align:start position:0%
quality standpoint we are excited about
 
04:50:07.628 --> 04:50:07.638 align:start position:0%
the Advent of electric vehicles I mean
 
04:50:10.708 --> 04:50:10.718 align:start position:0%
even factoring in all of the manufact
 
04:50:12.390 --> 04:50:12.400 align:start position:0%
cure of all of the components of the
 
04:50:15.470 --> 04:50:15.480 align:start position:0%
vehicle it's still a far less polluting
 
04:50:18.030 --> 04:50:18.040 align:start position:0%
vehicle option than than an internal
 
04:50:20.628 --> 04:50:20.638 align:start position:0%
combustion engine but from the other
 
04:50:22.548 --> 04:50:22.558 align:start position:0%
side of my agency from the Water
 
04:50:24.070 --> 04:50:24.080 align:start position:0%
Division from the waste division we're
 
04:50:25.948 --> 04:50:25.958 align:start position:0%
also concerned about the disposal of
 
04:50:28.548 --> 04:50:28.558 align:start position:0%
batteries about the potential for for
 
04:50:32.150 --> 04:50:32.160 align:start position:0%
contamination from fires uh and so the
 
04:50:34.788 --> 04:50:34.798 align:start position:0%
makeup of this commission seems to bring
 
04:50:36.510 --> 04:50:36.520 align:start position:0%
bring all of the right players to the
 
04:50:38.628 --> 04:50:38.638 align:start position:0%
table and we look very we we look
 
04:50:39.788 --> 04:50:39.798 align:start position:0%
forward to being part of this
 
04:50:41.948 --> 04:50:41.958 align:start position:0%
conversation and and working to bring as
 
04:50:45.070 --> 04:50:45.080 align:start position:0%
much information to the table as we can
 
04:50:47.750 --> 04:50:47.760 align:start position:0%
thank you thank any
 
04:50:51.110 --> 04:50:51.120 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you for your
 
04:50:53.350 --> 04:50:53.360 align:start position:0%
testimony does anyone else wish to
 
04:50:56.150 --> 04:50:56.160 align:start position:0%
testify on Senate Bill
 
04:51:07.230 --> 04:51:07.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:09.830 --> 04:51:09.840 align:start position:0%
hearing okay we'll go into executive
 
04:51:16.190 --> 04:51:16.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:18.788 --> 04:51:18.798 align:start position:0%
motion I'll move out to pass Madam
 
04:51:18.798 --> 04:51:26.270 align:start position:0%
motion I'll move out to pass Madam
chair

04:51:26.270 --> 04:51:26.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:28.270 --> 04:51:28.280 align:start position:0%
okay representative Schmidt is
 
04:51:30.910 --> 04:51:30.920 align:start position:0%
maintaining his position as the official
 
04:51:33.150 --> 04:51:33.160 align:start position:0%
second representative Simon do you to
 
04:51:35.230 --> 04:51:35.240 align:start position:0%
speak to your motion thank you madam
 
04:51:36.708 --> 04:51:36.718 align:start position:0%
chair it seems like all the interested
 
04:51:38.510 --> 04:51:38.520 align:start position:0%
parties are actually interested in
 
04:51:41.030 --> 04:51:41.040 align:start position:0%
having this conversation um be good to
 
04:51:42.590 --> 04:51:42.600 align:start position:0%
gather the information that they're
 
04:51:45.708 --> 04:51:45.718 align:start position:0%
looking into I think it' be useful and
 
04:51:48.230 --> 04:51:48.240 align:start position:0%
uh so I guess for those reasons uh I
 
04:51:49.548 --> 04:51:49.558 align:start position:0%
would move out to pass I'd also just
 
04:51:51.830 --> 04:51:51.840 align:start position:0%
like to add that if we have found a way
 
04:51:53.190 --> 04:51:53.200 align:start position:0%
to do these things without any
 
04:51:54.788 --> 04:51:54.798 align:start position:0%
legislators involved we're probably
 
04:51:57.070 --> 04:51:57.080 align:start position:0%
going to see more councils in the future
 
04:51:58.788 --> 04:51:58.798 align:start position:0%
and fewer committee and commissions
 
04:52:02.390 --> 04:52:02.400 align:start position:0%
that's that's my guess so I would so we
 
04:52:03.830 --> 04:52:03.840 align:start position:0%
might as well give one a try and see how
 
04:52:06.310 --> 04:52:06.320 align:start position:0%
it goes all right representative Schmidt
 
04:52:08.590 --> 04:52:08.600 align:start position:0%
do you wish to speak to your second I do
 
04:52:12.190 --> 04:52:12.200 align:start position:0%
M yes um I mean this is a proverbial
 
04:52:14.390 --> 04:52:14.400 align:start position:0%
no-brainer we we've got something that's
 
04:52:18.590 --> 04:52:18.600 align:start position:0%
coming at us like a car at 80 mil an
 
04:52:22.628 --> 04:52:22.638 align:start position:0%
hour uh that has all kinds of unknown
 
04:52:24.868 --> 04:52:24.878 align:start position:0%
aspects in terms of having a personal
 
04:52:28.190 --> 04:52:28.200 align:start position:0%
experience with it as I said earlier
 
04:52:31.070 --> 04:52:31.080 align:start position:0%
we're most of us are driving around with
 
04:52:33.430 --> 04:52:33.440 align:start position:0%
with things that have got a highly
 
04:52:37.830 --> 04:52:37.840 align:start position:0%
flammable highly explosive thing uh that
 
04:52:37.840 --> 04:52:39.030 align:start position:0%
flammable highly explosive thing uh that
and

04:52:39.030 --> 04:52:39.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:52:40.990 --> 04:52:41.000 align:start position:0%
and that's
 
04:52:44.990 --> 04:52:45.000 align:start position:0%
going 60 or 70 M hour down the road with
 
04:52:47.350 --> 04:52:47.360 align:start position:0%
other vehicles coming in other direction
 
04:52:52.350 --> 04:52:52.360 align:start position:0%
so uh we we have gas furnaces gas water
 
04:52:55.390 --> 04:52:55.400 align:start position:0%
heaters uh gas stoves and so forth in
 
04:52:58.628 --> 04:52:58.638 align:start position:0%
our houses uh and we've learned to live
 
04:53:01.788 --> 04:53:01.798 align:start position:0%
and sometimes die by the all these
 
04:53:05.230 --> 04:53:05.240 align:start position:0%
things so this is a no-brainer to have
 
04:53:08.150 --> 04:53:08.160 align:start position:0%
this Council to look into this and
 
04:53:12.190 --> 04:53:12.200 align:start position:0%
develop more expertise to advise us
 
04:53:13.868 --> 04:53:13.878 align:start position:0%
wisely in terms of how we're going to
 
04:53:16.750 --> 04:53:16.760 align:start position:0%
deal with this as it gets more and more
 
04:53:20.230 --> 04:53:20.240 align:start position:0%
and more uh
 
04:53:23.548 --> 04:53:23.558 align:start position:0%
ubiquitous representative uh Gart and
 
04:53:26.030 --> 04:53:26.040 align:start position:0%
then Dolan well I'm almost done and that
 
04:53:28.948 --> 04:53:28.958 align:start position:0%
is we're all we're also we're also
 
04:53:32.788 --> 04:53:32.798 align:start position:0%
carrying little heaters in our pockets
 
04:53:35.750 --> 04:53:35.760 align:start position:0%
right you ever touch it and go like wow
 
04:53:38.030 --> 04:53:38.040 align:start position:0%
this is hotter than I thought you know
 
04:53:40.830 --> 04:53:40.840 align:start position:0%
so forth and it's got an lithium ion
 
04:53:43.110 --> 04:53:43.120 align:start position:0%
battery in it ever see how they're
 
04:53:46.548 --> 04:53:46.558 align:start position:0%
created they're all wound up and so
 
04:53:49.750 --> 04:53:49.760 align:start position:0%
forth and so forth so we need to learn
 
04:53:53.310 --> 04:53:53.320 align:start position:0%
more about this except by personal
 
04:53:55.548 --> 04:53:55.558 align:start position:0%
experience thank you we'll try not to
 
04:53:58.190 --> 04:53:58.200 align:start position:0%
let anybody burn burn up from their
 
04:54:00.750 --> 04:54:00.760 align:start position:0%
phones representative
 
04:54:04.390 --> 04:54:04.400 align:start position:0%
Gart thank you madam chair I'm
 
04:54:06.310 --> 04:54:06.320 align:start position:0%
questioning so we're going to look at
 
04:54:09.030 --> 04:54:09.040 align:start position:0%
not we they we'll look at the effects on
 
04:54:10.868 --> 04:54:10.878 align:start position:0%
the environment well
 
04:54:12.590 --> 04:54:12.600 align:start position:0%
I'm concerned that we're not looking at
 
04:54:14.628 --> 04:54:14.638 align:start position:0%
the full effects as in how the lithium
 
04:54:16.548 --> 04:54:16.558 align:start position:0%
is mined I think that's kind of a larger
 
04:54:18.548 --> 04:54:18.558 align:start position:0%
equation I mean that is an effect on the
 
04:54:21.390 --> 04:54:21.400 align:start position:0%
environment and some uh local
 
04:54:23.750 --> 04:54:23.760 align:start position:0%
geopolitical aspects so just saying
 
04:54:25.470 --> 04:54:25.480 align:start position:0%
something I was thinking about okay
 
04:54:25.480 --> 04:54:27.430 align:start position:0%
something I was thinking about okay
represent

04:54:27.430 --> 04:54:27.440 align:start position:0%
represent
 
04:54:30.868 --> 04:54:30.878 align:start position:0%
Dolan thank you madam chair uh my
 
04:54:34.750 --> 04:54:34.760 align:start position:0%
question is more administrative in that
 
04:54:38.150 --> 04:54:38.160 align:start position:0%
uh we're rounding up a a fairly large
 
04:54:41.510 --> 04:54:41.520 align:start position:0%
population of state employees to do this
 
04:54:45.548 --> 04:54:45.558 align:start position:0%
this work um and probably some people
 
04:54:47.150 --> 04:54:47.160 align:start position:0%
that are on the higher end of the pay
 
04:54:48.510 --> 04:54:48.520 align:start position:0%
scale of state
 
04:54:51.430 --> 04:54:51.440 align:start position:0%
employees uh yet we have no fiscal node
 
04:54:53.548 --> 04:54:53.558 align:start position:0%
do we do we think that we're going to be
 
04:54:56.990 --> 04:54:57.000 align:start position:0%
able to accomplish this for for no
 
04:55:00.470 --> 04:55:00.480 align:start position:0%
cost uh the thing is that all those high
 
04:55:03.670 --> 04:55:03.680 align:start position:0%
level state employees such as the fire
 
04:55:07.430 --> 04:55:07.440 align:start position:0%
marshal are considered to be
 
04:55:09.830 --> 04:55:09.840 align:start position:0%
unclassified they do not have to punch a
 
04:55:11.030 --> 04:55:11.040 align:start position:0%
time clock
 
04:55:13.868 --> 04:55:13.878 align:start position:0%
and if they H we our expectation is
 
04:55:16.150 --> 04:55:16.160 align:start position:0%
usually that they will work extra hours
 
04:55:18.548 --> 04:55:18.558 align:start position:0%
if necessary to make this
 
04:55:22.110 --> 04:55:22.120 align:start position:0%
happen thank you I would just point out
 
04:55:25.990 --> 04:55:26.000 align:start position:0%
a lot of them have or design
 
04:55:29.868 --> 04:55:29.878 align:start position:0%
also yes yes or they have staff that are
 
04:55:31.788 --> 04:55:31.798 align:start position:0%
sitting around twiddling their thumbs
 
04:55:33.628 --> 04:55:33.638 align:start position:0%
not answering the phones that they can
 
04:55:35.310 --> 04:55:35.320 align:start position:0%
go to these
 
04:55:35.320 --> 04:55:36.948 align:start position:0%
go to these
meetings

04:55:36.948 --> 04:55:36.958 align:start position:0%
meetings
 
04:55:39.830 --> 04:55:39.840 align:start position:0%
um representative Brown and then maner
 
04:55:39.840 --> 04:55:40.948 align:start position:0%
um representative Brown and then maner
buy

04:55:40.948 --> 04:55:40.958 align:start position:0%
buy
 
04:55:42.350 --> 04:55:42.360 align:start position:0%
uh thank you madam chair a couple of
 
04:55:44.590 --> 04:55:44.600 align:start position:0%
comments I know I read this at home and
 
04:55:46.470 --> 04:55:46.480 align:start position:0%
I made a note under the environment to
 
04:55:48.430 --> 04:55:48.440 align:start position:0%
representative gard's comment I said why
 
04:55:52.670 --> 04:55:52.680 align:start position:0%
is this under 154 so uh RSA 154 is fire
 
04:55:56.510 --> 04:55:56.520 align:start position:0%
hazards so if it if it as it's under 154
 
04:55:59.628 --> 04:55:59.638 align:start position:0%
and fire hazards then it shouldn't be
 
04:56:01.990 --> 04:56:02.000 align:start position:0%
jumping over to other topics that that I
 
04:56:03.470 --> 04:56:03.480 align:start position:0%
think that you and I were I was
 
04:56:04.990 --> 04:56:05.000 align:start position:0%
concerned at home for the same question
 
04:56:08.750 --> 04:56:08.760 align:start position:0%
you had okay and appreciate that
 
04:56:10.990 --> 04:56:11.000 align:start position:0%
represent man py
 
04:56:14.628 --> 04:56:14.638 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair I I'm trying to
 
04:56:18.788 --> 04:56:18.798 align:start position:0%
control my comment all I'll say is
 
04:56:21.470 --> 04:56:21.480 align:start position:0%
knowledge is power ignorance is not
 
04:56:25.030 --> 04:56:25.040 align:start position:0%
Bliss that's all thank
 
04:56:28.230 --> 04:56:28.240 align:start position:0%
you yes represent Brown sorry madam
 
04:56:30.310 --> 04:56:30.320 align:start position:0%
chair just as a followup I I think this
 
04:56:33.150 --> 04:56:33.160 align:start position:0%
is a good idea because a number of times
 
04:56:34.590 --> 04:56:34.600 align:start position:0%
this year we've had this conversation
 
04:56:36.430 --> 04:56:36.440 align:start position:0%
about how many have these fires have
 
04:56:37.788 --> 04:56:37.798 align:start position:0%
there been and where have they been and
 
04:56:40.430 --> 04:56:40.440 align:start position:0%
fire parking garages so I think it's a a
 
04:56:43.150 --> 04:56:43.160 align:start position:0%
wonderful idea yes it will help us to
 
04:56:46.390 --> 04:56:46.400 align:start position:0%
deal with our study our interim study of
 
04:56:49.270 --> 04:56:49.280 align:start position:0%
the bill to ban EVS because we can refer
 
04:56:52.390 --> 04:56:52.400 align:start position:0%

for for your consideration this
 
05:01:14.190 --> 05:01:14.200 align:start position:0%
afternoon Senate Bill 210 which seeks to
 
05:01:16.628 --> 05:01:16.638 align:start position:0%
require all software contracts entered
 
05:01:19.830 --> 05:01:19.840 align:start position:0%
into by a state agency not to limit the
 
05:01:22.070 --> 05:01:22.080 align:start position:0%
agency's ability to run and install
 
05:01:24.470 --> 05:01:24.480 align:start position:0%
software on the infrastructure of the
 
05:01:27.110 --> 05:01:27.120 align:start position:0%
agency's choosing and approved by the
 
05:01:29.350 --> 05:01:29.360 align:start position:0%
department of Information Technology
 
05:01:31.548 --> 05:01:31.558 align:start position:0%
subject to certain statutory
 
05:01:31.558 --> 05:01:33.110 align:start position:0%
subject to certain statutory
Provisions

05:01:33.110 --> 05:01:33.120 align:start position:0%
Provisions
 
05:01:36.230 --> 05:01:36.240 align:start position:0%
um this legislation would improve the
 
05:01:38.590 --> 05:01:38.600 align:start position:0%
state's negotiation ability to prevent
 
05:01:41.510 --> 05:01:41.520 align:start position:0%
restrictive software licensing terms and
 
05:01:44.350 --> 05:01:44.360 align:start position:0%
business practices ensure greater choice
 
05:01:46.948 --> 05:01:46.958 align:start position:0%
and more competition and protect against
 
05:01:49.548 --> 05:01:49.558 align:start position:0%
surprise cost increases borne by the
 
05:01:53.230 --> 05:01:53.240 align:start position:0%
state and taxpayers one area where this
 
05:01:55.390 --> 05:01:55.400 align:start position:0%
legislation is particularly important it
 
05:01:58.868 --> 05:01:58.878 align:start position:0%
is in cloud computing the evolution of
 
05:02:01.548 --> 05:02:01.558 align:start position:0%
it systems has seen the rise in Cloud
 
05:02:04.350 --> 05:02:04.360 align:start position:0%
Computing Services aimed at reducing
 
05:02:07.230 --> 05:02:07.240 align:start position:0%
costs improving in efficiencies and
 
05:02:09.350 --> 05:02:09.360 align:start position:0%
workflows and strengthening cyber
 
05:02:09.360 --> 05:02:10.430 align:start position:0%
workflows and strengthening cyber
security

05:02:10.430 --> 05:02:10.440 align:start position:0%
security
 
05:02:12.510 --> 05:02:12.520 align:start position:0%
but States Across the Nation have been
 
05:02:14.830 --> 05:02:14.840 align:start position:0%
discovering restrictions buried in
 
05:02:17.190 --> 05:02:17.200 align:start position:0%
contracts on licensed portability and
 
05:02:19.708 --> 05:02:19.718 align:start position:0%
additional charges for trying to use
 
05:02:22.390 --> 05:02:22.400 align:start position:0%
software on anything other than the
 
05:02:25.788 --> 05:02:25.798 align:start position:0%
other software providers own cloud
 
05:02:28.270 --> 05:02:28.280 align:start position:0%
platform I believe it is important to
 
05:02:30.310 --> 05:02:30.320 align:start position:0%
ensure our state agencies are
 
05:02:32.670 --> 05:02:32.680 align:start position:0%
safeguarded against the potential
 
05:02:35.590 --> 05:02:35.600 align:start position:0%
anti-competitive actions that tie the
 
05:02:38.670 --> 05:02:38.680 align:start position:0%
hands of our it professionals and agency
 
05:02:42.070 --> 05:02:42.080 align:start position:0%
personnel and place our systems data and
 
05:02:45.350 --> 05:02:45.360 align:start position:0%
taxpayers at risk this bill is supported
 
05:02:47.430 --> 05:02:47.440 align:start position:0%

flexibility for the customer this
 
05:03:21.868 --> 05:03:21.878 align:start position:0%
legislation is forward-looking and would
 
05:03:23.910 --> 05:03:23.920 align:start position:0%
not impact current contractual
 
05:03:26.670 --> 05:03:26.680 align:start position:0%
arrangements for software Hardware or
 
05:03:30.150 --> 05:03:30.160 align:start position:0%
the cloud importantly the bill does not
 
05:03:32.270 --> 05:03:32.280 align:start position:0%
mandate the state do anything
 
05:03:36.390 --> 05:03:36.400 align:start position:0%
differently unless it chooses to do so
 
05:03:39.788 --> 05:03:39.798 align:start position:0%
doit and its partner agencies maintain
 
05:03:42.750 --> 05:03:42.760 align:start position:0%
full discretion and choice for it
 
05:03:44.310 --> 05:03:44.320 align:start position:0%
procurement and
 
05:03:46.830 --> 05:03:46.840 align:start position:0%
Contracting the bill aims only to
 
05:03:50.868 --> 05:03:50.878 align:start position:0%
provide state agencies and doit more
 
05:03:53.510 --> 05:03:53.520 align:start position:0%
leverage in the contract negotiations
 
05:03:56.910 --> 05:03:56.920 align:start position:0%
for it which safeguards against rigid
 
05:03:59.470 --> 05:03:59.480 align:start position:0%
expensive or predatory licensing
 
05:04:02.470 --> 05:04:02.480 align:start position:0%
agreements that box New Hampshire into
 
05:04:05.868 --> 05:04:05.878 align:start position:0%
costly less secure and less Innovative
 
05:04:08.830 --> 05:04:08.840 align:start position:0%
products technology is advancing at an
 
05:04:11.470 --> 05:04:11.480 align:start position:0%
amazing pace and our state should have
 
05:04:14.190 --> 05:04:14.200 align:start position:0%
as much flexibility to make the choices
 
05:04:17.708 --> 05:04:17.718 align:start position:0%
that best fit our needs in the future
 
05:04:20.670 --> 05:04:20.680 align:start position:0%
the Senate passed uh this bipartisan
 
05:04:23.430 --> 05:04:23.440 align:start position:0%
legislation by Voice Voice vote in
 
05:04:25.868 --> 05:04:25.878 align:start position:0%
January it's worth noting that during
 
05:04:27.990 --> 05:04:28.000 align:start position:0%
the Senate's consideration of Senate
 
05:04:31.190 --> 05:04:31.200 align:start position:0%
Bill 210 there was no public testimony
 
05:04:33.910 --> 05:04:33.920 align:start position:0%
offered in opposition to this bill
 
05:04:36.830 --> 05:04:36.840 align:start position:0%
furthermore the commissioner of doit has
 
05:04:39.110 --> 05:04:39.120 align:start position:0%
indicated that the bill will have zero
 
05:04:41.470 --> 05:04:41.480 align:start position:0%
fiscal impact on the
 
05:04:44.350 --> 05:04:44.360 align:start position:0%
state similar legislation has been acted
 
05:04:48.390 --> 05:04:48.400 align:start position:0%
in Colorado Indiana Missouri Illinois
 
05:04:50.310 --> 05:04:50.320 align:start position:0%
and Minnesota and is currently be
 
05:04:52.750 --> 05:04:52.760 align:start position:0%
considered in Massachusetts New Jersey
 
05:04:55.548 --> 05:04:55.558 align:start position:0%
and here it is also being introduced in
 
05:04:58.190 --> 05:04:58.200 align:start position:0%
more than a doen dozen other states
 
05:05:00.430 --> 05:05:00.440 align:start position:0%
because state governments like Private
 
05:05:02.990 --> 05:05:03.000 align:start position:0%
Industry should not have Technology
 
05:05:06.230 --> 05:05:06.240 align:start position:0%
Solutions forced upon them but rather be
 
05:05:08.910 --> 05:05:08.920 align:start position:0%
afforded options that make technological
 
05:05:11.510 --> 05:05:11.520 align:start position:0%
and Financial sense for their agencies
 
05:05:14.030 --> 05:05:14.040 align:start position:0%
and their citizens um at this point

05:06:13.830 --> 05:06:13.840 align:start position:0%
perspective um and doit itself is not

on the Senate side uh that you know you
 
05:06:23.310 --> 05:06:23.320 align:start position:0%

05:06:24.868 --> 05:06:24.878 align:start position:0%
and I want to make sure you you knew
 
05:06:27.070 --> 05:06:27.080 align:start position:0%
that that we're not concerned with that
 
05:06:29.030 --> 05:06:29.040 align:start position:0%
that respect and also I'm here to answer
 
05:06:31.270 --> 05:06:31.280 align:start position:0%
any questions from our perspective if
 
05:06:33.868 --> 05:06:33.878 align:start position:0%
need be thank you for being here are
 
05:06:36.230 --> 05:06:36.240 align:start position:0%
there any
 
05:06:38.910 --> 05:06:38.920 align:start position:0%
questions represent leus thanks could
 
05:06:41.150 --> 05:06:41.160 align:start position:0%
you give us at least least one example
 
05:06:43.868 --> 05:06:43.878 align:start position:0%
of some kind of a have there been
 
05:06:45.830 --> 05:06:45.840 align:start position:0%
situations where there has been software
 
05:06:47.548 --> 05:06:47.558 align:start position:0%
that the states wanted to purchase that
 
05:06:49.948 --> 05:06:49.958 align:start position:0%
had restrictive requirements this bill
 
05:06:51.670 --> 05:06:51.680 align:start position:0%
would prohibit at least have some feel
 
05:06:54.948 --> 05:06:54.958 align:start position:0%
for sure what what we're seeing um is
 
05:06:58.628 --> 05:06:58.638 align:start position:0%
some in some cases companies who have um
 
05:06:59.868 --> 05:06:59.878 align:start position:0%
you know invested in vertical
 
05:07:02.030 --> 05:07:02.040 align:start position:0%
integration so who have the you know the
 
05:07:04.190 --> 05:07:04.200 align:start position:0%
ability to license software or subscri
 
05:07:06.350 --> 05:07:06.360 align:start position:0%
software subscriptions and also own
 
05:07:08.868 --> 05:07:08.878 align:start position:0%
infrastructure um do differentiate their
 
05:07:10.910 --> 05:07:10.920 align:start position:0%
pricing based on whether you're hosting
 
05:07:13.350 --> 05:07:13.360 align:start position:0%
in their environments or in one of their
 
05:07:16.708 --> 05:07:16.718 align:start position:0%
competitor's environments or in your own
 
05:07:18.788 --> 05:07:18.798 align:start position:0%
environment followup
 
05:07:22.190 --> 05:07:22.200 align:start position:0%
followup um I'm seeing here
 
05:07:25.470 --> 05:07:25.480 align:start position:0%
that it it can't be required to run you
 
05:07:26.628 --> 05:07:26.638 align:start position:0%
they can't keep you from running on the
 
05:07:28.510 --> 05:07:28.520 align:start position:0%
software you're choosing but it would
 
05:07:30.230 --> 05:07:30.240 align:start position:0%
prevent uh I don't I'm not seeing where
 
05:07:32.510 --> 05:07:32.520 align:start position:0%
prevent a difference in
 
05:07:36.510 --> 05:07:36.520 align:start position:0%
pricing well you know I've I I would
 
05:07:38.390 --> 05:07:38.400 align:start position:0%
agree with you sir um I you know I've
 
05:07:39.868 --> 05:07:39.878 align:start position:0%
scratched my head about this language a
 
05:07:41.628 --> 05:07:41.638 align:start position:0%
little bit and and wonder what the next
 
05:07:44.150 --> 05:07:44.160 align:start position:0%
step is in in the you know I see this as
 
05:07:46.270 --> 05:07:46.280 align:start position:0%
probably maybe a longer term
 
05:07:50.510 --> 05:07:50.520 align:start position:0%
process that um that the um Coalition is
 
05:07:52.310 --> 05:07:52.320 align:start position:0%
involved in I've asked them that
 
05:07:54.430 --> 05:07:54.440 align:start position:0%
question explicitly what's the next
 
05:07:56.548 --> 05:07:56.558 align:start position:0%
action and I have not received an answer
 
05:07:58.390 --> 05:07:58.400 align:start position:0%
to that right thank you the Coalition is
 
05:08:01.030 --> 05:08:01.040 align:start position:0%
the next next person to testify
 
05:08:03.110 --> 05:08:03.120 align:start position:0%
representative Dolan thank you madam
 
05:08:03.120 --> 05:08:05.190 align:start position:0%
representative Dolan thank you madam
chair

05:08:05.190 --> 05:08:05.200 align:start position:0%
chair
 
05:08:09.190 --> 05:08:09.200 align:start position:0%
and the question that I have is uh one
 
05:08:11.868 --> 05:08:11.878 align:start position:0%
that I know the federal government is is
 
05:08:14.590 --> 05:08:14.600 align:start position:0%
wrestling with and that is are you does
 
05:08:16.350 --> 05:08:16.360 align:start position:0%
this legislation or would this
 
05:08:20.110 --> 05:08:20.120 align:start position:0%
legislation restrict yourself or the
 
05:08:23.350 --> 05:08:23.360 align:start position:0%
Governor from the executive uh uh side
 
05:08:26.430 --> 05:08:26.440 align:start position:0%
of the government restricting state
 
05:08:28.750 --> 05:08:28.760 align:start position:0%
agencies from using C certain social
 
05:08:30.910 --> 05:08:30.920 align:start position:0%
media platforms that I know like I said
 
05:08:32.750 --> 05:08:32.760 align:start position:0%
the federal government is currently
 
05:08:35.590 --> 05:08:35.600 align:start position:0%
wrestling with uh no I I don't see this
 
05:08:37.230 --> 05:08:37.240 align:start position:0%
as relating to that although you know
 
05:08:38.910 --> 05:08:38.920 align:start position:0%
there is an executive order out there
 
05:08:38.920 --> 05:08:39.910 align:start position:0%
there is an executive order out there
that

05:08:39.910 --> 05:08:39.920 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:08:44.830 --> 05:08:44.840 align:start position:0%
that um is um restricting the use of of
 
05:08:47.750 --> 05:08:47.760 align:start position:0%
um certain Chinese Technologies on uh on
 
05:08:49.430 --> 05:08:49.440 align:start position:0%
the state networks and we're enforcing
 
05:08:51.310 --> 05:08:51.320 align:start position:0%
that but that's that's that's where I
 
05:08:56.830 --> 05:08:56.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:08.350 --> 05:09:08.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:08.360 --> 05:09:15.150 align:start position:0%
 
Drexel

05:09:15.150 --> 05:09:15.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:17.030 --> 05:09:17.040 align:start position:0%
thank you m please turn your microphone
 
05:09:19.590 --> 05:09:19.600 align:start position:0%
M my apologies thank you madam chair and
 
05:09:21.510 --> 05:09:21.520 align:start position:0%
members of the committee for having me U
 
05:09:23.150 --> 05:09:23.160 align:start position:0%
my name is Scott Drexel and I'm here on
 
05:09:24.948 --> 05:09:24.958 align:start position:0%
behalf of the Coalition for fair
 
05:09:27.110 --> 05:09:27.120 align:start position:0%
software licensing the Coalition was
 
05:09:30.150 --> 05:09:30.160 align:start position:0%
launched in 2022 and it's comprised of
 
05:09:31.830 --> 05:09:31.840 align:start position:0%
North American companies and trade
 
05:09:33.350 --> 05:09:33.360 align:start position:0%
organizations representing AC
 
05:09:35.270 --> 05:09:35.280 align:start position:0%
cross-section of key Industries
 
05:09:37.830 --> 05:09:37.840 align:start position:0%
including Health Care Financial Services
 
05:09:40.270 --> 05:09:40.280 align:start position:0%
manufacturing software and cloud and
 
05:09:42.548 --> 05:09:42.558 align:start position:0%
cyber security providers the goals of
 
05:09:44.310 --> 05:09:44.320 align:start position:0%
the Coalition are rooted in nine
 
05:09:46.708 --> 05:09:46.718 align:start position:0%
principles of fair software licensing a
 
05:09:48.510 --> 05:09:48.520 align:start position:0%
set of Industry practices aimed at
 
05:09:51.390 --> 05:09:51.400 align:start position:0%
creating greater transparency Innovation
 
05:09:54.110 --> 05:09:54.120 align:start position:0%
choice and Security in the cloud the
 
05:09:55.788 --> 05:09:55.798 align:start position:0%
cloud offers significant opportunities
 
05:09:57.868 --> 05:09:57.878 align:start position:0%
for software customers especially state
 
05:09:59.430 --> 05:09:59.440 align:start position:0%
and local governments uh and other
 
05:10:01.548 --> 05:10:01.558 align:start position:0%
public agencies to realize a wide swath
 
05:10:03.910 --> 05:10:03.920 align:start position:0%
of public of benefits including cost
 
05:10:06.390 --> 05:10:06.400 align:start position:0%
savings workflow efficiencies greater
 
05:10:08.670 --> 05:10:08.680 align:start position:0%
flexibility for an evolving Workforce
 
05:10:10.430 --> 05:10:10.440 align:start position:0%
and ultimately an increased capacity on
 
05:10:12.150 --> 05:10:12.160 align:start position:0%
the part of State institutions to
 
05:10:13.910 --> 05:10:13.920 align:start position:0%
provide critical services to their
 
05:10:15.708 --> 05:10:15.718 align:start position:0%
constituents but in order to take
 
05:10:17.948 --> 05:10:17.958 align:start position:0%
advantage of these possibilities that
 
05:10:20.070 --> 05:10:20.080 align:start position:0%
the cloud has to offer public and
 
05:10:22.150 --> 05:10:22.160 align:start position:0%
private entities should come together
 
05:10:24.070 --> 05:10:24.080 align:start position:0%
around standards of fairness
 
05:10:26.670 --> 05:10:26.680 align:start position:0%
transparency and choice for the customer
 
05:10:28.310 --> 05:10:28.320 align:start position:0%
the legislation before you today takes
 
05:10:30.270 --> 05:10:30.280 align:start position:0%
an important step toward that goal
 
05:10:32.030 --> 05:10:32.040 align:start position:0%
particularly as it relates to the choice
 
05:10:34.750 --> 05:10:34.760 align:start position:0%
of the customer in this case the state
 
05:10:37.390 --> 05:10:37.400 align:start position:0%
very simply sb210 requires that
 
05:10:39.070 --> 05:10:39.080 align:start position:0%
contracts for the purchase of software
 
05:10:41.548 --> 05:10:41.558 align:start position:0%
by the state do not limit the ability of
 
05:10:43.590 --> 05:10:43.600 align:start position:0%
state agencies to run that software
 
05:10:45.830 --> 05:10:45.840 align:start position:0%
using the cloud provider of their choice
 
05:10:49.470 --> 05:10:49.480 align:start position:0%
now why is this necessary prior to 2019
 
05:10:51.150 --> 05:10:51.160 align:start position:0%
this was typical industry practice it
 
05:10:54.070 --> 05:10:54.080 align:start position:0%
was called Bol bring your own license
 
05:10:55.990 --> 05:10:56.000 align:start position:0%
once a customer purchased software
 
05:10:58.110 --> 05:10:58.120 align:start position:0%
licenses the customer was allowed to
 
05:10:59.910 --> 05:10:59.920 align:start position:0%
choose the hardware environment that
 
05:11:01.948 --> 05:11:01.958 align:start position:0%
best met its business needs and that was
 
05:11:03.990 --> 05:11:04.000 align:start position:0%
good it encouraged uh greater
 
05:11:06.390 --> 05:11:06.400 align:start position:0%
interoperability vendor diversification
 
05:11:08.230 --> 05:11:08.240 align:start position:0%
which is in the end good for cyber
 
05:11:11.350 --> 05:11:11.360 align:start position:0%
security but in 2019 some Legacy
 
05:11:13.430 --> 05:11:13.440 align:start position:0%
software providers began restricting out
 
05:11:15.390 --> 05:11:15.400 align:start position:0%
of out of no particular technical
 
05:11:17.868 --> 05:11:17.878 align:start position:0%
necessity where their software could be
 
05:11:20.910 --> 05:11:20.920 align:start position:0%
run that new restriction was intended to
 
05:11:23.350 --> 05:11:23.360 align:start position:0%
leverage the popularity of one product
 
05:11:25.470 --> 05:11:25.480 align:start position:0%
line to sell additional goods and
 
05:11:28.270 --> 05:11:28.280 align:start position:0%
services beyond the scope of any RFP
 
05:11:29.910 --> 05:11:29.920 align:start position:0%
regardless of whether the customer
 
05:11:31.750 --> 05:11:31.760 align:start position:0%
needed or wanted those additional
 
05:11:34.070 --> 05:11:34.080 align:start position:0%
products uh it was intended to gain an
 
05:11:36.110 --> 05:11:36.120 align:start position:0%
advantage in an increasingly competitive
 
05:11:39.270 --> 05:11:39.280 align:start position:0%
cloud computing Market sp210 would
 
05:11:41.470 --> 05:11:41.480 align:start position:0%
correct that Dynamic by ensuring that
 
05:11:43.310 --> 05:11:43.320 align:start position:0%
the ultimate Choice belongs to the state
 
05:11:45.708 --> 05:11:45.718 align:start position:0%
and Central it it would prevent the
 
05:11:47.788 --> 05:11:47.798 align:start position:0%
vendor from dictating to the customer
 
05:11:50.628 --> 05:11:50.638 align:start position:0%
again in this case the state um how the
 
05:11:52.190 --> 05:11:52.200 align:start position:0%
customer can use the products that it's
 
05:11:55.190 --> 05:11:55.200 align:start position:0%
already purchased at its core sp210 is a
 
05:11:57.070 --> 05:11:57.080 align:start position:0%
technology procurement Good Housekeeping
 
05:11:59.788 --> 05:11:59.798 align:start position:0%
bill it's narrowly tailored it applies
 
05:12:01.750 --> 05:12:01.760 align:start position:0%
only to Future procurement contracts it
 
05:12:03.230 --> 05:12:03.240 align:start position:0%
doesn't implicate any that are already
 
05:12:05.990 --> 05:12:06.000 align:start position:0%
in effect uh it does not constrain the
 
05:12:07.948 --> 05:12:07.958 align:start position:0%
state in its choice of software or of
 
05:12:09.868 --> 05:12:09.878 align:start position:0%
cloud provider instead empowering state
 
05:12:12.070 --> 05:12:12.080 align:start position:0%
agencies to select the software vendors
 
05:12:13.910 --> 05:12:13.920 align:start position:0%
or Hardware environments that best meet
 
05:12:15.830 --> 05:12:15.840 align:start position:0%
their business needs in fact it doesn't
 
05:12:17.830 --> 05:12:17.840 align:start position:0%
require anything of the state at all uh
 
05:12:19.628 --> 05:12:19.638 align:start position:0%
it incentivizes vendor
 
05:12:21.910 --> 05:12:21.920 align:start position:0%
diversification um and again strengthens
 
05:12:24.110 --> 05:12:24.120 align:start position:0%
cyber security it does not ask the state
 
05:12:25.868 --> 05:12:25.878 align:start position:0%
to pick winners and losers instead it
 
05:12:27.470 --> 05:12:27.480 align:start position:0%
Fosters healthy competition in the
 
05:12:29.548 --> 05:12:29.558 align:start position:0%
public Cloud which lowers cost to
 
05:12:31.750 --> 05:12:31.760 align:start position:0%
taxpayers it's a critical facet of free
 
05:12:33.910 --> 05:12:33.920 align:start position:0%
enterprise right uh greater competition
 
05:12:36.310 --> 05:12:36.320 align:start position:0%
in the marketplace lowers cost and it
 
05:12:38.830 --> 05:12:38.840 align:start position:0%
Fosters Innovation uh prioritizes the
 
05:12:40.750 --> 05:12:40.760 align:start position:0%
needs of the state over the preference
 
05:12:43.910 --> 05:12:43.920 align:start position:0%
of the software vendor so um I I'll stop
 
05:12:45.350 --> 05:12:45.360 align:start position:0%
there I just want to um sort of
 
05:12:47.390 --> 05:12:47.400 align:start position:0%
reiterate this is um this is not a novel
 
05:12:49.548 --> 05:12:49.558 align:start position:0%
bill it's it's already passed in
 
05:12:52.270 --> 05:12:52.280 align:start position:0%
Colorado Missouri uh Illinois and most
 
05:12:55.430 --> 05:12:55.440 align:start position:0%
recently Indiana um in in every case
 
05:12:57.910 --> 05:12:57.920 align:start position:0%
overwhelmingly um because this is again
 
05:13:00.830 --> 05:13:00.840 align:start position:0%
something that that really uh I think
 
05:13:03.670 --> 05:13:03.680 align:start position:0%
treats the stewardship of of taxpayer
 
05:13:06.150 --> 05:13:06.160 align:start position:0%
dollars um with a a high degree of
 
05:13:09.510 --> 05:13:09.520 align:start position:0%
priority and um you know with with a
 
05:13:12.590 --> 05:13:12.600 align:start position:0%
best practices for the industry in mind
 
05:13:14.868 --> 05:13:14.878 align:start position:0%
um and again I I believe I've emailed it
 
05:13:17.070 --> 05:13:17.080 align:start position:0%
to all of the committee members but
 
05:13:18.430 --> 05:13:18.440 align:start position:0%
there's a joint letter in support of
 
05:13:21.548 --> 05:13:21.558 align:start position:0%
this legislation from a number of of um
 
05:13:24.310 --> 05:13:24.320 align:start position:0%
software industry groups including my my
 
05:13:25.990 --> 05:13:26.000 align:start position:0%
group The Coalition for fair software
 
05:13:28.830 --> 05:13:28.840 align:start position:0%
licensing net Choice um ccia the
 
05:13:30.270 --> 05:13:30.280 align:start position:0%
computer Communications industry
 
05:13:32.390 --> 05:13:32.400 align:start position:0%
Association and the alliance for digital
 
05:13:35.070 --> 05:13:35.080 align:start position:0%
Innovation thank you very much thank you
 
05:13:38.030 --> 05:13:38.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:40.708 --> 05:13:40.718 align:start position:0%
questions pres Brown thank you madam
 
05:13:42.708 --> 05:13:42.718 align:start position:0%
chair uh thanks for taking my question
 
05:13:44.310 --> 05:13:44.320 align:start position:0%
thanks for being here is there so there
 
05:13:48.670 --> 05:13:48.680 align:start position:0%
must be a a a benefit to software
 
05:13:51.510 --> 05:13:51.520 align:start position:0%
Sellers from this am I am I reading
 
05:13:52.948 --> 05:13:52.958 align:start position:0%
between the lines of what you're saying
 
05:13:57.750 --> 05:13:57.760 align:start position:0%
to that a benefit to software sellers um
 
05:14:02.030 --> 05:14:02.040 align:start position:0%
yes when you are a a um especially from
 
05:14:03.628 --> 05:14:03.638 align:start position:0%
a standpoint of innovation right if you
 
05:14:06.150 --> 05:14:06.160 align:start position:0%
have a a startup or a midsize company
 
05:14:08.788 --> 05:14:08.798 align:start position:0%
that's able to sell their product um in
 
05:14:11.670 --> 05:14:11.680 align:start position:0%
a way that that is that frees the state
 
05:14:14.030 --> 05:14:14.040 align:start position:0%
from constraint around what additional
 
05:14:16.510 --> 05:14:16.520 align:start position:0%
products and services it has to buy then
 
05:14:19.190 --> 05:14:19.200 align:start position:0%
your product stands you know on its own
 
05:14:20.548 --> 05:14:20.558 align:start position:0%
against the other product that that the
 
05:14:23.110 --> 05:14:23.120 align:start position:0%
big guy offering so it is it is a net
 
05:14:26.030 --> 05:14:26.040 align:start position:0%
benefit to software providers in the
 
05:14:28.390 --> 05:14:28.400 align:start position:0%
sense that you you're you're not having
 
05:14:30.788 --> 05:14:30.798 align:start position:0%
sort of um anti-competitive behavior on
 
05:14:32.868 --> 05:14:32.878 align:start position:0%
the part of large companies that are
 
05:14:34.990 --> 05:14:35.000 align:start position:0%
preventing smaller and midsize
 
05:14:37.110 --> 05:14:37.120 align:start position:0%
innovators in the marketplace from from
 
05:14:38.750 --> 05:14:38.760 align:start position:0%
offering a product that could benefit
 
05:14:41.708 --> 05:14:41.718 align:start position:0%
the the the state or or the
 
05:14:44.390 --> 05:14:44.400 align:start position:0%
customer thank you thank you sir any
 
05:14:44.400 --> 05:14:48.590 align:start position:0%
customer thank you thank you sir any
other

05:14:48.590 --> 05:14:48.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:50.788 --> 05:14:50.798 align:start position:0%
questions excellent job thank you very
 
05:14:53.030 --> 05:14:53.040 align:start position:0%
much thank you madam chair is there
 
05:14:54.990 --> 05:14:55.000 align:start position:0%
anyone else who wishes to testify on
 
05:14:58.510 --> 05:14:58.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:06.628 --> 05:15:06.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:11.670 --> 05:15:11.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:14.628 --> 05:15:14.638 align:start position:0%
M okay we'll go into executive session
 
05:15:16.628 --> 05:15:16.638 align:start position:0%
does someone have a motion sure I'll
 
05:15:18.670 --> 05:15:18.680 align:start position:0%
make the motion of ought to pass on
 
05:15:20.708 --> 05:15:20.718 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill
 
05:15:26.350 --> 05:15:26.360 align:start position:0%
210 is there a second uh second
 
05:15:31.628 --> 05:15:31.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:33.830 --> 05:15:33.840 align:start position:0%
um I mean this doesn't put any
 
05:15:37.708 --> 05:15:37.718 align:start position:0%
restrictions on no I
 
05:15:41.708 --> 05:15:41.718 align:start position:0%
guess it it gives the dit and other
 
05:15:43.390 --> 05:15:43.400 align:start position:0%
state agencies the ability to run this
 
05:15:44.990 --> 05:15:45.000 align:start position:0%
on whatever platform makes the best
 
05:15:48.590 --> 05:15:48.600 align:start position:0%
sense from uh you know a financial or
 
05:15:50.470 --> 05:15:50.480 align:start position:0%
other consideration point of view which
 
05:15:54.230 --> 05:15:54.240 align:start position:0%
I think is positive and um it also
 
05:15:55.910 --> 05:15:55.920 align:start position:0%
prevents a possible situation where
 
05:15:57.628 --> 05:15:57.638 align:start position:0%
you've got you want software from a
 
05:15:59.230 --> 05:15:59.240 align:start position:0%
number of different vendors they require
 
05:16:00.990 --> 05:16:01.000 align:start position:0%
their software to run on different
 
05:16:02.350 --> 05:16:02.360 align:start position:0%
platforms so now you got to deal with
 
05:16:03.708 --> 05:16:03.718 align:start position:0%
these different platforms if you want
 
05:16:06.030 --> 05:16:06.040 align:start position:0%
their software which is which
 
05:16:08.910 --> 05:16:08.920 align:start position:0%
complicates uh the job and probably
 
05:16:10.190 --> 05:16:10.200 align:start position:0%
makes it more expensive so I think in
 
05:16:12.670 --> 05:16:12.680 align:start position:0%
general it's a good idea representative
 
05:16:15.150 --> 05:16:15.160 align:start position:0%
Brown um I thank you madam chair I I
 
05:16:17.548 --> 05:16:17.558 align:start position:0%
would just mention that that while I was
 
05:16:20.868 --> 05:16:20.878 align:start position:0%
a Dees we spent a very large sum of of
 
05:16:23.150 --> 05:16:23.160 align:start position:0%
of money on uh of Homeland Security gram
 
05:16:26.868 --> 05:16:26.878 align:start position:0%
money on a an air modeling software that
 
05:16:29.470 --> 05:16:29.480 align:start position:0%
would help the track toxics released in
 
05:16:31.150 --> 05:16:31.160 align:start position:0%
the air in an emergency
 
05:16:33.548 --> 05:16:33.558 align:start position:0%
situation and it came down to the fact
 
05:16:36.150 --> 05:16:36.160 align:start position:0%
that um we had one device it could be
 
05:16:38.548 --> 05:16:38.558 align:start position:0%
used on and when that person left and
 
05:16:40.788 --> 05:16:40.798 align:start position:0%
moved we were not allowed to move it or
 
05:16:42.708 --> 05:16:42.718 align:start position:0%
put it on another device or do anything
 
05:16:45.270 --> 05:16:45.280 align:start position:0%
with it and it became defunct in about
 
05:16:49.270 --> 05:16:49.280 align:start position:0%
10 months so I'm so sorry to hear
 
05:16:52.110 --> 05:16:52.120 align:start position:0%
that anyone
 
05:16:56.150 --> 05:16:56.160 align:start position:0%
else all right in that case the motion
 
05:16:58.470 --> 05:16:58.480 align:start position:0%
is ought to pass by representative
 
05:17:01.470 --> 05:17:01.480 align:start position:0%

all right good afternoon everyone I'm
 
05:29:45.670 --> 05:29:45.680 align:start position:0%
opening the the public hearing on Senate
 
05:30:06.948 --> 05:30:06.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:06.958 --> 05:30:08.910 align:start position:0%

05:30:08.910 --> 05:30:08.920 align:start position:0%
Bradley
 
05:30:11.750 --> 05:30:11.760 align:start position:0%
good afternoon uh Madam chair members of
 
05:30:14.470 --> 05:30:14.480 align:start position:0%
the committee for the record uh Jeb
 
05:30:15.948 --> 05:30:15.958 align:start position:0%
Bradley from
 
05:30:20.910 --> 05:30:20.920 align:start position:0%
wolfboro and here um as the sponsor of
 
05:30:24.310 --> 05:30:24.320 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 439 which obviously passed
 
05:30:27.430 --> 05:30:27.440 align:start position:0%
the Senate and now is up for your
 
05:30:30.990 --> 05:30:31.000 align:start position:0%
consideration um this bill is building
 
05:30:34.190 --> 05:30:34.200 align:start position:0%
upon the executive action of the
 
05:30:37.110 --> 05:30:37.120 align:start position:0%
governor um to say that executive
 
05:30:41.230 --> 05:30:41.240 align:start position:0%
agencies cannot um participate in
 
05:30:43.590 --> 05:30:43.600 align:start position:0%
anything that would be part of
 
05:30:43.600 --> 05:30:45.390 align:start position:0%
anything that would be part of
boycotting

05:30:45.390 --> 05:30:45.400 align:start position:0%
boycotting
 
05:30:48.350 --> 05:30:48.360 align:start position:0%
Israel uh the
 
05:30:51.948 --> 05:30:51.958 align:start position:0%
governor created that executive order a
 
05:30:55.110 --> 05:30:55.120 align:start position:0%
little over a year ago as I recall and I
 
05:30:57.708 --> 05:30:57.718 align:start position:0%
felt that this legislation was important
 
05:31:01.150 --> 05:31:01.160 align:start position:0%
in light of um what happened on October
 
05:31:06.310 --> 05:31:06.320 align:start position:0%
7th and um the ongoing controversy so
 
05:31:11.270 --> 05:31:11.280 align:start position:0%
the nuts and Bolt of the bill are
 
05:31:13.948 --> 05:31:13.958 align:start position:0%
starting on page two where there's a new
 
05:31:17.390 --> 05:31:17.400 align:start position:0%
section of RSA
 
05:31:21.750 --> 05:31:21.760 align:start position:0%
211 um that starts with a definition of
 
05:31:24.030 --> 05:31:24.040 align:start position:0%
what boycotting Israel
 
05:31:28.670 --> 05:31:28.680 align:start position:0%
means um and then really the heart of
 
05:31:33.708 --> 05:31:33.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:37.310 --> 05:31:37.320 align:start position:0%
203 and four that notwithstanding any
 
05:31:39.070 --> 05:31:39.080 align:start position:0%
other provision ision of law no
 
05:31:42.708 --> 05:31:42.718 align:start position:0%
executive branch agency May adopt any
 
05:31:44.628 --> 05:31:44.638 align:start position:0%
investment policy that would have the
 
05:31:47.910 --> 05:31:47.920 align:start position:0%
effect of requiring or inducing any
 
05:31:52.030 --> 05:31:52.040 align:start position:0%
person to boycott Israel so
 
05:31:54.990 --> 05:31:55.000 align:start position:0%
um with regard to executive branch
 
05:31:57.430 --> 05:31:57.440 align:start position:0%
agencies they cannot invest in
 
05:32:00.150 --> 05:32:00.160 align:start position:0%
companies um found to be boycotting
 
05:32:02.548 --> 05:32:02.558 align:start position:0%
Israel they can't contract with
 
05:32:06.470 --> 05:32:06.480 align:start position:0%
companies um this is the policy that the
 
05:32:10.150 --> 05:32:10.160 align:start position:0%
governor adopted this would put it into
 
05:32:13.470 --> 05:32:13.480 align:start position:0%
law and then as it goes further onto
 
05:32:17.110 --> 05:32:17.120 align:start position:0%
page three um talks about what would
 
05:32:21.070 --> 05:32:21.080 align:start position:0%
happen if there is a company boycotting
 
05:32:24.430 --> 05:32:24.440 align:start position:0%
or an executive agency Israel so I think
 
05:32:26.190 --> 05:32:26.200 align:start position:0%
you know to get back to the beginning of
 
05:32:28.990 --> 05:32:29.000 align:start position:0%
the bill uh the purpose statement sort
 
05:32:33.470 --> 05:32:33.480 align:start position:0%
of says the why um this is
 
05:32:33.480 --> 05:32:35.548 align:start position:0%
of says the why um this is
important

05:32:35.548 --> 05:32:35.558 align:start position:0%
important
 
05:32:39.230 --> 05:32:39.240 align:start position:0%
um New Hampshire as I understand it does
 
05:32:43.990 --> 05:32:44.000 align:start position:0%
a over aund million of exports as of
 
05:32:46.708 --> 05:32:46.718 align:start position:0%
2021 um that means
 
05:32:46.718 --> 05:32:48.270 align:start position:0%
2021 um that means
substantial

05:32:48.270 --> 05:32:48.280 align:start position:0%
substantial
 
05:32:53.070 --> 05:32:53.080 align:start position:0%
job growth in this state
 
05:32:56.270 --> 05:32:56.280 align:start position:0%
um the purpose statement goes on to say
 
05:32:59.030 --> 05:32:59.040 align:start position:0%
that any boycott of entities or
 
05:33:02.390 --> 05:33:02.400 align:start position:0%
individuals um amount to an ethnic
 
05:33:05.708 --> 05:33:05.718 align:start position:0%
religious racial and or nationality
 
05:33:09.070 --> 05:33:09.080 align:start position:0%
discrimination and it is consistent
 
05:33:12.430 --> 05:33:12.440 align:start position:0%
um as outlined on line 17 and 18 that
 
05:33:14.788 --> 05:33:14.798 align:start position:0%
it's the public policy of the United
 
05:33:18.230 --> 05:33:18.240 align:start position:0%
States that's enshrined in several laws
 
05:33:23.830 --> 05:33:23.840 align:start position:0%
that boycotts against Israel um are not
 
05:33:27.548 --> 05:33:27.558 align:start position:0%
um are not to be tolerated
 
05:33:31.310 --> 05:33:31.320 align:start position:0%
so that's the bill um as I said it
 
05:33:33.708 --> 05:33:33.718 align:start position:0%
passed the Senate I believe
 
05:33:36.868 --> 05:33:36.878 align:start position:0%
unanimously and I as I recall on a Voice
 
05:33:40.470 --> 05:33:40.480 align:start position:0%
vote um sponsored by most of the
 
05:33:44.430 --> 05:33:44.440 align:start position:0%
Senators and I hope that it will receive
 
05:33:48.190 --> 05:33:48.200 align:start position:0%
a favorable reaction from you
 
05:33:51.628 --> 05:33:51.638 align:start position:0%
folks thank you Senator we do have some
 
05:33:54.390 --> 05:33:54.400 align:start position:0%
questions I'm Shu and then
 
05:33:56.670 --> 05:33:56.680 align:start position:0%
lus thank you madam chair thank you
 
05:34:01.270 --> 05:34:01.280 align:start position:0%
Senator uh for appearing before us um so
 
05:34:04.230 --> 05:34:04.240 align:start position:0%
this is basically codifying the
 
05:34:06.990 --> 05:34:07.000 align:start position:0%
governor's executive order and can you
 
05:34:10.830 --> 05:34:10.840 align:start position:0%
tell us what's the difference between uh
 
05:34:13.788 --> 05:34:13.798 align:start position:0%
codification and an executive order why
 
05:34:17.590 --> 05:34:17.600 align:start position:0%
would this be better well I'm sorry
 
05:34:19.470 --> 05:34:19.480 align:start position:0%
potentially an executive order could be
 
05:34:22.230 --> 05:34:22.240 align:start position:0%
countermanded by a successive Governor
 
05:34:24.830 --> 05:34:24.840 align:start position:0%
um if a successive Governor didn't issue
 
05:34:27.110 --> 05:34:27.120 align:start position:0%
an executive order so this codifies it
 
05:34:30.110 --> 05:34:30.120 align:start position:0%
it gives it the strength of
 
05:34:33.470 --> 05:34:33.480 align:start position:0%
law representative lus thank you um I
 
05:34:36.590 --> 05:34:36.600 align:start position:0%
see this is in uh 21i administrative
 
05:34:39.190 --> 05:34:39.200 align:start position:0%
Services um um which includes
 
05:34:42.470 --> 05:34:42.480 align:start position:0%
procurement um so would this affect or
 
05:34:44.430 --> 05:34:44.440 align:start position:0%
not affect with the governor's executive
 
05:34:45.910 --> 05:34:45.920 align:start position:0%
order does it affect uh the New
 
05:34:48.070 --> 05:34:48.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire retirement
 
05:34:51.390 --> 05:34:51.400 align:start position:0%
system uh the New Hampshire retirement
 
05:34:52.990 --> 05:34:53.000 align:start position:0%
system is
 
05:34:57.030 --> 05:34:57.040 align:start position:0%
not an executive Ranch but I believe
 
05:35:00.470 --> 05:35:00.480 align:start position:0%
that um the governor's executive order
 
05:35:02.270 --> 05:35:02.280 align:start position:0%
covered the retirement system and so
 
05:35:04.910 --> 05:35:04.920 align:start position:0%
this were my understanding is
 
05:35:08.350 --> 05:35:08.360 align:start position:0%
also okay does followup followup
 
05:35:10.070 --> 05:35:10.080 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm not seeing it included in here
 
05:35:11.948 --> 05:35:11.958 align:start position:0%
so it doesn't seem like this legislation
 
05:35:14.110 --> 05:35:14.120 align:start position:0%
would do that but I was wondering about
 
05:35:16.030 --> 05:35:16.040 align:start position:0%
the uh the governor's executive order
 
05:35:19.510 --> 05:35:19.520 align:start position:0%
but uh uh that is a good question I'm
 
05:35:21.390 --> 05:35:21.400 align:start position:0%
sorry I don't have an answer all right
 
05:35:21.400 --> 05:35:22.510 align:start position:0%
sorry I don't have an answer all right
thank

05:35:22.510 --> 05:35:22.520 align:start position:0%
thank
 
05:35:25.590 --> 05:35:25.600 align:start position:0%
you anyone
 
05:35:29.310 --> 05:35:29.320 align:start position:0%
else thank you madam chair um Senator
 
05:35:32.548 --> 05:35:32.558 align:start position:0%
Bradley the title is discrimination
 
05:35:34.868 --> 05:35:34.878 align:start position:0%
boycots of Israel in state procurement
 
05:35:38.030 --> 05:35:38.040 align:start position:0%
and Investments so if it would not
 
05:35:39.708 --> 05:35:39.718 align:start position:0%
include the New Hampshire retirement
 
05:35:42.590 --> 05:35:42.600 align:start position:0%
system what investments would the state
 
05:35:44.708 --> 05:35:44.718 align:start position:0%
make other than that we'll let him
 
05:35:47.948 --> 05:35:47.958 align:start position:0%
answer sorry so if I I guess what I
 
05:35:50.350 --> 05:35:50.360 align:start position:0%
would suggest is let me do a little
 
05:35:51.990 --> 05:35:52.000 align:start position:0%
research and
 
05:35:55.708 --> 05:35:55.718 align:start position:0%
determine whether the retirement system
 
05:35:58.070 --> 05:35:58.080 align:start position:0%
is included in this or not my thought
 
05:36:00.470 --> 05:36:00.480 align:start position:0%
was it was but you might be right
 
05:36:00.480 --> 05:36:01.948 align:start position:0%
was it was but you might be right
representative

05:36:01.948 --> 05:36:01.958 align:start position:0%

repr thank you madam chair thank you uh
 
05:36:10.150 --> 05:36:10.160 align:start position:0%
Senator Bradley for appearing taking my
 
05:36:13.390 --> 05:36:13.400 align:start position:0%
question um this legislation is
 
05:36:13.400 --> 05:36:14.830 align:start position:0%
question um this legislation is
obviously

05:36:14.830 --> 05:36:14.840 align:start position:0%
obviously
 
05:36:19.948 --> 05:36:19.958 align:start position:0%
targeted uh to prohibit uh boycotts of
 
05:36:23.868 --> 05:36:23.878 align:start position:0%
Israel uh other what other
 
05:36:28.110 --> 05:36:28.120 align:start position:0%
countries are there currently uh issues
 
05:36:31.708 --> 05:36:31.718 align:start position:0%
with procurement other than Israel uh I
 
05:36:33.548 --> 05:36:33.558 align:start position:0%
mean what what what countries are we
 
05:36:35.430 --> 05:36:35.440 align:start position:0%
currently discriminating against other
 
05:36:35.440 --> 05:36:36.510 align:start position:0%
currently discriminating against other
than

05:36:36.510 --> 05:36:36.520 align:start position:0%
than
 
05:36:39.628 --> 05:36:39.638 align:start position:0%
Israel I don't know if there are
 
05:36:41.628 --> 05:36:41.638 align:start position:0%
any but
 
05:36:45.990 --> 05:36:46.000 align:start position:0%
I I'm just I'm not certain of that
 
05:36:48.430 --> 05:36:48.440 align:start position:0%
either thank
 
05:36:52.110 --> 05:36:52.120 align:start position:0%
you representative Gard thank you madam
 
05:36:56.430 --> 05:36:56.440 align:start position:0%
chair just a little bit confused on page
 
05:37:00.708 --> 05:37:00.718 align:start position:0%
that two I guess but
 
05:37:03.910 --> 05:37:03.920 align:start position:0%
line 22 it starts Roman numeral 7
 
05:37:05.430 --> 05:37:05.440 align:start position:0%
there's no exhaustive definition of
 
05:37:07.750 --> 05:37:07.760 align:start position:0%
anti-semitism as it can take many forms
 
05:37:09.270 --> 05:37:09.280 align:start position:0%
then it goes on with the quote
 
05:37:10.910 --> 05:37:10.920 align:start position:0%
anti-Semitism a certain perception of
 
05:37:12.788 --> 05:37:12.798 align:start position:0%
Jews which maybe expresses hatred toward
 
05:37:15.830 --> 05:37:15.840 align:start position:0%
Jews and it goes on my question is is
 
05:37:18.470 --> 05:37:18.480 align:start position:0%
this to say that boycotting Israel is
 
05:37:19.910 --> 05:37:19.920 align:start position:0%
anti-Semitic because it doesn't
 
05:37:21.590 --> 05:37:21.600 align:start position:0%
specifically state that but it's just
 
05:37:25.510 --> 05:37:25.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:29.830 --> 05:37:29.840 align:start position:0%
there as I think is intended in this
 
05:37:29.840 --> 05:37:30.990 align:start position:0%
there as I think is intended in this
purpose

05:37:30.990 --> 05:37:31.000 align:start position:0%
purpose
 
05:37:31.000 --> 05:37:33.030 align:start position:0%
purpose
statement

05:37:33.030 --> 05:37:33.040 align:start position:0%
statement
 
05:37:35.590 --> 05:37:35.600 align:start position:0%
um there as it says there's no
 
05:37:37.990 --> 05:37:38.000 align:start position:0%
exhaustive definition of
 
05:37:42.350 --> 05:37:42.360 align:start position:0%
anti-Semitism but um as you see further
 
05:37:45.628 --> 05:37:45.638 align:start position:0%
down um on line 26 it's a certain
 
05:37:49.110 --> 05:37:49.120 align:start position:0%
perception of Jewish people which may be
 
05:37:53.590 --> 05:37:53.600 align:start position:0%
expressed as hatred um so rhetorical and
 
05:37:55.910 --> 05:37:55.920 align:start position:0%
physical manifestations which a boycott
 
05:37:59.190 --> 05:37:59.200 align:start position:0%
would be I think are covered by that
 
05:37:59.200 --> 05:38:00.628 align:start position:0%
would be I think are covered by that
thank

05:38:00.628 --> 05:38:00.638 align:start position:0%
thank
 
05:38:03.310 --> 05:38:03.320 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
05:38:06.750 --> 05:38:06.760 align:start position:0%
schm thank you madam chair so I want to
 
05:38:09.190 --> 05:38:09.200 align:start position:0%
pick up on what representative Gard was
 
05:38:12.190 --> 05:38:12.200 align:start position:0%
starting into and that is that there is
 
05:38:15.510 --> 05:38:15.520 align:start position:0%
a number of references uh or a number of
 
05:38:17.590 --> 05:38:17.600 align:start position:0%
references with regard to
 
05:38:22.390 --> 05:38:22.400 align:start position:0%
anti-jewish or anti-israel or
 
05:38:25.190 --> 05:38:25.200 align:start position:0%
anti-Semitism and you referen in your
 
05:38:29.868 --> 05:38:29.878 align:start position:0%
opening remarks uh that the October
 
05:38:29.878 --> 05:38:31.830 align:start position:0%
opening remarks uh that the October
7th

05:38:31.830 --> 05:38:31.840 align:start position:0%
7th
 
05:38:35.830 --> 05:38:35.840 align:start position:0%
attack that um we're all very familiar
 
05:38:38.230 --> 05:38:38.240 align:start position:0%
with uh are there there are no other
 
05:38:40.990 --> 05:38:41.000 align:start position:0%
reasons for the for
 
05:38:41.000 --> 05:38:43.390 align:start position:0%
reasons for the for
possible

05:38:43.390 --> 05:38:43.400 align:start position:0%
possible
 
05:38:48.910 --> 05:38:48.920 align:start position:0%
um anti- Israeli government uh action
 
05:38:52.150 --> 05:38:52.160 align:start position:0%
with regard to the current situation
 
05:38:55.948 --> 05:38:55.958 align:start position:0%
which is seeing as you know thousands of
 
05:39:00.190 --> 05:39:00.200 align:start position:0%
gin in in Jeopardy uh on a whole series
 
05:39:00.200 --> 05:39:01.468 align:start position:0%
gin in in Jeopardy uh on a whole series
of

05:39:01.468 --> 05:39:01.478 align:start position:0%
of
 
05:39:04.468 --> 05:39:04.478 align:start position:0%
bases not enough food not enough clean
 
05:39:07.510 --> 05:39:07.520 align:start position:0%
water uh not enough medical supplies not
 
05:39:10.390 --> 05:39:10.400 align:start position:0%
enough fuel not enough electricity if
 
05:39:15.350 --> 05:39:15.360 align:start position:0%
any and so forth so um I'm I'm troubled
 
05:39:19.510 --> 05:39:19.520 align:start position:0%
by the idea that that they this seems to
 
05:39:21.990 --> 05:39:22.000 align:start position:0%
be focused on the idea of
 
05:39:25.910 --> 05:39:25.920 align:start position:0%
anti-Semitism so the point I was trying
 
05:39:30.030 --> 05:39:30.040 align:start position:0%
to make is that the governor's executive
 
05:39:33.548 --> 05:39:33.558 align:start position:0%
order um came out before October 7th and
 
05:39:35.708 --> 05:39:35.718 align:start position:0%
that in light of October 7th I thought
 
05:39:38.910 --> 05:39:38.920 align:start position:0%
it was important to ctif it in a bill
 
05:39:41.270 --> 05:39:41.280 align:start position:0%
given what happened on October 7th and
 
05:39:43.150 --> 05:39:43.160 align:start position:0%
that's why the
 
05:39:47.590 --> 05:39:47.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:50.030 --> 05:39:50.040 align:start position:0%
you other questions rep
 
05:39:53.830 --> 05:39:53.840 align:start position:0%
in I would I could have missed it but
 
05:39:56.628 --> 05:39:56.638 align:start position:0%
when you mentioned $100 million in
 
05:40:00.788 --> 05:40:00.798 align:start position:0%
exports new Hamp from New Hampshire
 
05:40:03.510 --> 05:40:03.520 align:start position:0%
exports this is a total number or is
 
05:40:06.310 --> 05:40:06.320 align:start position:0%
this exports I'm just trying to
 
05:40:09.310 --> 05:40:09.320 align:start position:0%
understand the qualifications of that
 
05:40:09.320 --> 05:40:10.868 align:start position:0%
understand the qualifications of that
$100

05:40:10.868 --> 05:40:10.878 align:start position:0%
$100
 
05:40:13.430 --> 05:40:13.440 align:start position:0%
million so that's my understanding and
 
05:40:17.110 --> 05:40:17.120 align:start position:0%
the research that we did with
 
05:40:20.110 --> 05:40:20.120 align:start position:0%
um the Bureau of economic Affairs that
 
05:40:22.788 --> 05:40:22.798 align:start position:0%
there's over aund million of exports in
 
05:40:29.030 --> 05:40:29.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:29.040 --> 05:40:31.990 align:start position:0%
 
Israel

05:40:31.990 --> 05:40:32.000 align:start position:0%
Israel
 
05:40:36.230 --> 05:40:36.240 align:start position:0%
other I have a question um isn't you've
 
05:40:37.750 --> 05:40:37.760 align:start position:0%
cited several cases
 
05:40:41.430 --> 05:40:41.440 align:start position:0%
where discrimination against Israel or
 
05:40:44.830 --> 05:40:44.840 align:start position:0%
whatever is
 
05:40:48.190 --> 05:40:48.200 align:start position:0%
illegal and do you think it's necessary
 
05:40:50.830 --> 05:40:50.840 align:start position:0%
for us to pass a law to say that we
 
05:40:53.590 --> 05:40:53.600 align:start position:0%
won't do business with with companies
 
05:40:57.030 --> 05:40:57.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:00.708 --> 05:41:00.718 align:start position:0%
acts that's why I'm here so yes okay
 
05:41:03.230 --> 05:41:03.240 align:start position:0%
thank you I glad to have that out in the
 
05:41:06.390 --> 05:41:06.400 align:start position:0%
open representative Brown uh thank you
 
05:41:08.868 --> 05:41:08.878 align:start position:0%
madam chair uh thank you Senator did in
 
05:41:10.868 --> 05:41:10.878 align:start position:0%
in your research or other testimony was
 
05:41:10.878 --> 05:41:11.628 align:start position:0%
in your research or other testimony was
there

05:41:11.628 --> 05:41:11.638 align:start position:0%
there
 
05:41:15.070 --> 05:41:15.080 align:start position:0%
any um information about the impact that
 
05:41:18.190 --> 05:41:18.200 align:start position:0%
this would have on any companies that
 
05:41:22.110 --> 05:41:22.120 align:start position:0%
that do employ boycotts against
 
05:41:26.110 --> 05:41:26.120 align:start position:0%
Israel no okay and followup followup
 
05:41:28.390 --> 05:41:28.400 align:start position:0%
and I I'll guess that there was no
 
05:41:30.070 --> 05:41:30.080 align:start position:0%
information on New Hampshire companies
 
05:41:32.628 --> 05:41:32.638 align:start position:0%
that might be in that position none that
 
05:41:33.948 --> 05:41:33.958 align:start position:0%
I'm aware
 
05:41:40.110 --> 05:41:40.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:43.750 --> 05:41:43.760 align:start position:0%
um the governor already I issued an
 
05:41:47.948 --> 05:41:47.958 align:start position:0%
executive order this just codifies it
 
05:41:51.868 --> 05:41:51.878 align:start position:0%
than Senator do you have the fiscal
 
05:41:54.110 --> 05:41:54.120 align:start position:0%
note um this version doesn't have
 
05:41:56.350 --> 05:41:56.360 align:start position:0%
anything mentioned it says we don't have
 
05:41:59.670 --> 05:41:59.680 align:start position:0%
it yet and I have the uh fiscal note of
 
05:42:01.390 --> 05:42:01.400 align:start position:0%
the introduced bill and I don't believe
 
05:42:02.510 --> 05:42:02.520 align:start position:0%
there was an
 
05:42:04.990 --> 05:42:05.000 align:start position:0%
amendment no there wasn't that we know
 
05:42:08.590 --> 05:42:08.600 align:start position:0%
of uh what is the fiscal note
 
05:42:08.600 --> 05:42:10.750 align:start position:0%
of uh what is the fiscal note
uh

05:42:10.750 --> 05:42:10.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:42:13.430 --> 05:42:13.440 align:start position:0%
well no change to
 
05:42:13.440 --> 05:42:15.110 align:start position:0%
well no change to
revenue

05:42:15.110 --> 05:42:15.120 align:start position:0%
revenue
 
05:42:20.110 --> 05:42:20.120 align:start position:0%
um an indeterminable increase of
 
05:42:23.390 --> 05:42:23.400 align:start position:0%
expenditures and no
 
05:42:26.270 --> 05:42:26.280 align:start position:0%
Appropriations so the fiscal note should
 
05:42:29.628 --> 05:42:29.638 align:start position:0%
be attached to the bill um but that's
 
05:42:31.150 --> 05:42:31.160 align:start position:0%
what it says I think we got the original
 
05:42:33.070 --> 05:42:33.080 align:start position:0%
version the in the original version
 
05:42:36.110 --> 05:42:36.120 align:start position:0%
that's correct okay thank
 
05:42:36.120 --> 05:42:41.110 align:start position:0%
that's correct okay thank
you

05:42:41.110 --> 05:42:41.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:41.120 --> 05:42:42.310 align:start position:0%
 
other

05:42:42.310 --> 05:42:42.320 align:start position:0%
other
 
05:42:45.230 --> 05:42:45.240 align:start position:0%
questions being none thank you Senator
 
05:42:58.590 --> 05:42:58.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:00.990 --> 05:43:01.000 align:start position:0%
Shapiro thank you madam chair and
 
05:43:04.468 --> 05:43:04.478 align:start position:0%
committee members I think um for the
 
05:43:07.190 --> 05:43:07.200 align:start position:0%
record um I representative Joe Shapiro
 
05:43:10.468 --> 05:43:10.478 align:start position:0%
from Keen representing keen and nine
 
05:43:13.390 --> 05:43:13.400 align:start position:0%
small surrounding communities also for
 
05:43:15.868 --> 05:43:15.878 align:start position:0%
the record I am Jewish with my mother's
 
05:43:17.910 --> 05:43:17.920 align:start position:0%
parents arriving from Romania and my
 
05:43:20.190 --> 05:43:20.200 align:start position:0%
father's from Lithuania in the early
 
05:43:23.628 --> 05:43:23.638 align:start position:0%
20th century while they escaped European
 
05:43:25.830 --> 05:43:25.840 align:start position:0%
the European Holocaust not all of their
 
05:43:27.750 --> 05:43:27.760 align:start position:0%
extended families were able to come to
 
05:43:30.430 --> 05:43:30.440 align:start position:0%
America and undoubtedly many of them
 
05:43:32.270 --> 05:43:32.280 align:start position:0%
perished at the hands of the
 
05:43:35.270 --> 05:43:35.280 align:start position:0%
Nazis so why would I come here today to
 
05:43:38.390 --> 05:43:38.400 align:start position:0%
speak in opposition to SB
 
05:43:40.750 --> 05:43:40.760 align:start position:0%
429 which would prevent the state of New
 
05:43:42.270 --> 05:43:42.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire from doing business with
 
05:43:43.708 --> 05:43:43.718 align:start position:0%
companies who have been involved in
 
05:43:45.670 --> 05:43:45.680 align:start position:0%
boycotting the state of
 
05:43:48.990 --> 05:43:49.000 align:start position:0%
Israel let me be clear it is not because
 
05:43:51.510 --> 05:43:51.520 align:start position:0%
I'm against Israel I have traveled to
 
05:43:53.910 --> 05:43:53.920 align:start position:0%
Israel it is an amazing place with
 
05:43:55.628 --> 05:43:55.638 align:start position:0%
amazing people who have made
 
05:43:57.670 --> 05:43:57.680 align:start position:0%
extraordinary accomplishments in the
 
05:44:00.350 --> 05:44:00.360 align:start position:0%
face of hostility and threats of
 
05:44:02.510 --> 05:44:02.520 align:start position:0%
annihilation here are my reasons for
 
05:44:04.070 --> 05:44:04.080 align:start position:0%
opposing this
 
05:44:07.150 --> 05:44:07.160 align:start position:0%
bill first I believe this bill restricts
 
05:44:10.030 --> 05:44:10.040 align:start position:0%
constitutionally protected free speech
 
05:44:11.548 --> 05:44:11.558 align:start position:0%
in fact while the results have been
 
05:44:13.948 --> 05:44:13.958 align:start position:0%
mixed in federal courts a number of
 
05:44:16.548 --> 05:44:16.558 align:start position:0%
States including Kansas Arizona Texas
 
05:44:19.070 --> 05:44:19.080 align:start position:0%
and Arkansas have had similar laws
 
05:44:21.070 --> 05:44:21.080 align:start position:0%
blocked by federal
 
05:44:24.670 --> 05:44:24.680 align:start position:0%
courts second this bill dishonors a
 
05:44:26.830 --> 05:44:26.840 align:start position:0%
proud and historically important
 
05:44:29.190 --> 05:44:29.200 align:start position:0%
tradition of nonviolent political
 
05:44:31.390 --> 05:44:31.400 align:start position:0%
boycotts to bring social
 
05:44:34.070 --> 05:44:34.080 align:start position:0%
change please consider the Montgomery
 
05:44:36.990 --> 05:44:37.000 align:start position:0%
bus bus boycott started when Rosa Parks
 
05:44:39.150 --> 05:44:39.160 align:start position:0%
refused to move to the back of the
 
05:44:43.310 --> 05:44:43.320 align:start position:0%
bus in December of 1955 and ended with
 
05:44:45.910 --> 05:44:45.920 align:start position:0%
desegregation of public transportation
 
05:44:49.150 --> 05:44:49.160 align:start position:0%
in the South a year later also consider
 
05:44:49.160 --> 05:44:50.310 align:start position:0%
in the South a year later also consider
the

05:44:50.310 --> 05:44:50.320 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:44:53.350 --> 05:44:53.360 align:start position:0%
movement in the US and worldwide in the
 
05:44:55.868 --> 05:44:55.878 align:start position:0%
1980s to devest in the government of
 
05:44:58.548 --> 05:44:58.558 align:start position:0%
South Africa which led to the end of a
 
05:45:00.548 --> 05:45:00.558 align:start position:0%
partide and the election of Nelson
 
05:45:03.310 --> 05:45:03.320 align:start position:0%
Mandela a few years later in
 
05:45:08.788 --> 05:45:08.798 align:start position:0%
1964 1994 excuse me third if you believe
 
05:45:11.510 --> 05:45:11.520 align:start position:0%
as I do that the attack on October 7th
 
05:45:14.590 --> 05:45:14.600 align:start position:0%
was a Savage genocidal terrorist attack
 
05:45:17.750 --> 05:45:17.760 align:start position:0%
against innocent Israeli civilians and
 
05:45:20.110 --> 05:45:20.120 align:start position:0%
that it was not an isolated incident
 
05:45:22.468 --> 05:45:22.478 align:start position:0%
during the second inapa in Israel
 
05:45:26.628 --> 05:45:26.638 align:start position:0%
between 2000 and 2005 Israel's Israelis
 
05:45:29.350 --> 05:45:29.360 align:start position:0%
were routinely routinely blown up on
 
05:45:31.990 --> 05:45:32.000 align:start position:0%
buses merely for the fact of traveling
 
05:45:33.948 --> 05:45:33.958 align:start position:0%
to work or going to
 
05:45:36.510 --> 05:45:36.520 align:start position:0%
school if you believe that violence
 
05:45:39.230 --> 05:45:39.240 align:start position:0%
against Israeli civilians has been a
 
05:45:41.868 --> 05:45:41.878 align:start position:0%
frequently used tactic then why would
 
05:45:44.190 --> 05:45:44.200 align:start position:0%
you choose to prohibit a protest tactic
 
05:45:46.628 --> 05:45:46.638 align:start position:0%
that is nonviolent in J in nature
 
05:45:48.788 --> 05:45:48.798 align:start position:0%
doesn't this incentivize
 
05:45:51.830 --> 05:45:51.840 align:start position:0%
violence last reason representatives in
 
05:45:53.948 --> 05:45:53.958 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire house should know more
 
05:45:56.510 --> 05:45:56.520 align:start position:0%
than anyone that one can disagree with
 
05:45:59.430 --> 05:45:59.440 align:start position:0%
current laws be critical of certain
 
05:46:01.990 --> 05:46:02.000 align:start position:0%
policies and make every effort to change
 
05:46:04.750 --> 05:46:04.760 align:start position:0%
the direction of a government all while
 
05:46:07.110 --> 05:46:07.120 align:start position:0%
remaining patriotic and fiercely loyal
 
05:46:11.628 --> 05:46:11.638 align:start position:0%
to our state the same is true of Israel
 
05:46:13.910 --> 05:46:13.920 align:start position:0%
laws that prohibit disagreement over
 
05:46:16.868 --> 05:46:16.878 align:start position:0%
policy and ban nonviolent actions such
 
05:46:19.868 --> 05:46:19.878 align:start position:0%
as boycotts to change such policies even
 
05:46:21.708 --> 05:46:21.718 align:start position:0%
if you think some of the people doing so
 
05:46:25.548 --> 05:46:25.558 align:start position:0%
are wrongheaded are just a step too far
 
05:46:27.830 --> 05:46:27.840 align:start position:0%
I am not a member of the BDS movement
 
05:46:29.750 --> 05:46:29.760 align:start position:0%
nor do I necessarily support the
 
05:46:32.830 --> 05:46:32.840 align:start position:0%
specific goals of the BDS leadership but
 
05:46:34.590 --> 05:46:34.600 align:start position:0%
I do not think that the state of New
 
05:46:37.110 --> 05:46:37.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire should participate in Banning
 
05:46:39.548 --> 05:46:39.558 align:start position:0%
political speech and I hope you will
 
05:46:44.750 --> 05:46:44.760 align:start position:0%
agree with me thank you are there any
 
05:46:47.468 --> 05:46:47.478 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
05:46:49.788 --> 05:46:49.798 align:start position:0%
Schmidt thank you madam chair so I'd
 
05:46:51.590 --> 05:46:51.600 align:start position:0%
like to pursue the line of questioning
 
05:46:56.110 --> 05:46:56.120 align:start position:0%
that I started with uh Senator
 
05:46:59.230 --> 05:46:59.240 align:start position:0%
Bradley uh there are repeated references
 
05:46:59.240 --> 05:47:01.430 align:start position:0%
Bradley uh there are repeated references
to

05:47:01.430 --> 05:47:01.440 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:47:01.440 --> 05:47:03.910 align:start position:0%
to
anti-Semitism

05:47:03.910 --> 05:47:03.920 align:start position:0%
anti-Semitism
 
05:47:05.830 --> 05:47:05.840 align:start position:0%
uh and
 
05:47:09.510 --> 05:47:09.520 align:start position:0%
I and I asked him whether it was not
 
05:47:14.030 --> 05:47:14.040 align:start position:0%
possible to be uh against some of the
 
05:47:17.990 --> 05:47:18.000 align:start position:0%
things that were happening um in Israel
 
05:47:20.548 --> 05:47:20.558 align:start position:0%
without having anything to do with
 
05:47:22.868 --> 05:47:22.878 align:start position:0%
anti-Semitism can you speak to that
 
05:47:22.878 --> 05:47:30.190 align:start position:0%
anti-Semitism can you speak to that
particular

05:47:30.190 --> 05:47:30.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:33.110 --> 05:47:33.120 align:start position:0%
aspect um the answer is yes I think that
 
05:47:36.830 --> 05:47:36.840 align:start position:0%
one can um be a supporter of Israel
 
05:47:39.110 --> 05:47:39.120 align:start position:0%
believe in Israel's right to exist
 
05:47:41.430 --> 05:47:41.440 align:start position:0%
believe in Israel's right to exist as a
 
05:47:46.468 --> 05:47:46.478 align:start position:0%
religious um country um and disagree
 
05:47:48.510 --> 05:47:48.520 align:start position:0%
with some of the policies of the Israeli
 
05:47:50.788 --> 05:47:50.798 align:start position:0%
government um just like we do all the
 
05:47:55.070 --> 05:47:55.080 align:start position:0%
time here um and unfortunately I think
 
05:47:58.070 --> 05:47:58.080 align:start position:0%
the terminology of
 
05:48:02.788 --> 05:48:02.798 align:start position:0%
anti-Semitism anti-Semitism is real I
 
05:48:05.390 --> 05:48:05.400 align:start position:0%
mean I mean I don't want to pull out my
 
05:48:07.628 --> 05:48:07.638 align:start position:0%
emails and show you some of the vile
 
05:48:10.150 --> 05:48:10.160 align:start position:0%
anti-semitic emails that I've gotten
 
05:48:12.350 --> 05:48:12.360 align:start position:0%
serving in the legislature it is a real
 
05:48:19.390 --> 05:48:19.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:22.750 --> 05:48:22.760 align:start position:0%
when when CR criticisms of certain
 
05:48:25.270 --> 05:48:25.280 align:start position:0%
policies whether they been be in Israel
 
05:48:30.548 --> 05:48:30.558 align:start position:0%
or any place else um is um is suppressed
 
05:48:34.070 --> 05:48:34.080 align:start position:0%
by calling those people anti-semitic and
 
05:48:35.708 --> 05:48:35.718 align:start position:0%
that sometimes
 
05:48:35.718 --> 05:48:37.270 align:start position:0%
that sometimes
happens

05:48:37.270 --> 05:48:37.280 align:start position:0%
happens
 
05:48:42.948 --> 05:48:42.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:45.190 --> 05:48:45.200 align:start position:0%
questions thank you for your testimony
 
05:48:48.070 --> 05:48:48.080 align:start position:0%
and I appreciate your uh keeping keeping
 
05:48:51.030 --> 05:48:51.040 align:start position:0%
your remarks to the intent of the Bill
 
05:48:51.040 --> 05:48:56.230 align:start position:0%
your remarks to the intent of the Bill
thank

05:48:56.230 --> 05:48:56.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:58.590 --> 05:48:58.600 align:start position:0%
you speaking of that we have a whole lot
 
05:49:02.150 --> 05:49:02.160 align:start position:0%
of people who are opposed to the bill I
 
05:49:05.150 --> 05:49:05.160 align:start position:0%
will will give you all a chance to speak
 
05:49:08.110 --> 05:49:08.120 align:start position:0%
but I would like to say firstly that we
 
05:49:11.670 --> 05:49:11.680 align:start position:0%
ought to concentrate on the bill I will
 
05:49:11.680 --> 05:49:13.230 align:start position:0%
ought to concentrate on the bill I will
not

05:49:13.230 --> 05:49:13.240 align:start position:0%
not
 
05:49:13.240 --> 05:49:14.830 align:start position:0%
not
tolerate

05:49:14.830 --> 05:49:14.840 align:start position:0%
tolerate
 
05:49:17.910 --> 05:49:17.920 align:start position:0%
saying trash talking Israel
 
05:49:22.468 --> 05:49:22.478 align:start position:0%
essentially or blame or
 
05:49:25.030 --> 05:49:25.040 align:start position:0%
um or and I would hope that you would
 
05:49:26.628 --> 05:49:26.638 align:start position:0%
not be
 
05:49:29.110 --> 05:49:29.120 align:start position:0%
repetitive we will listen to all of you
 
05:49:33.030 --> 05:49:33.040 align:start position:0%
but uh believe me the the fifth time
 
05:49:34.990 --> 05:49:35.000 align:start position:0%
something is said is way less effective
 
05:49:47.350 --> 05:49:47.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:49.670 --> 05:49:49.680 align:start position:0%
kti I hope you will try that's why
 
05:49:49.680 --> 05:49:51.708 align:start position:0%
kti I hope you will try that's why
you're

05:49:51.708 --> 05:49:51.718 align:start position:0%
you're
 
05:49:54.868 --> 05:49:54.878 align:start position:0%
first question yes please turn your
 
05:49:57.830 --> 05:49:57.840 align:start position:0%
microphone on and introduce yourself my
 
05:50:01.430 --> 05:50:01.440 align:start position:0%
name is AJ klei I'm 18 I've lived in New
 
05:50:02.948 --> 05:50:02.958 align:start position:0%
Hampshire my whole
 
05:50:07.468 --> 05:50:07.478 align:start position:0%
life um gez yeah I don't really know
 
05:50:10.310 --> 05:50:10.320 align:start position:0%
where to start I guess I'll start here
 
05:50:14.350 --> 05:50:14.360 align:start position:0%
where it says um on line 11 that these
 
05:50:16.948 --> 05:50:16.958 align:start position:0%
boy cots you know often amount to ethnic
 
05:50:19.310 --> 05:50:19.320 align:start position:0%
religious racial or nationality
 
05:50:22.350 --> 05:50:22.360 align:start position:0%
discrimination um and I think that's
 
05:50:24.868 --> 05:50:24.878 align:start position:0%
what representative Schmidt was just
 
05:50:27.590 --> 05:50:27.600 align:start position:0%
talking about how and and the other
 
05:50:29.990 --> 05:50:30.000 align:start position:0%
person who was just up here
 
05:50:33.590 --> 05:50:33.600 align:start position:0%
equating being against a violent thing
 
05:50:36.270 --> 05:50:36.280 align:start position:0%
that's going on to being against an
 
05:50:40.070 --> 05:50:40.080 align:start position:0%
entire group of religious people or any
 
05:50:42.628 --> 05:50:42.638 align:start position:0%
sort of group of people like you can
 
05:50:44.628 --> 05:50:44.638 align:start position:0%
that's apples and oranges you can be
 
05:50:47.910 --> 05:50:47.920 align:start position:0%
against the death and destruction and
 
05:50:52.230 --> 05:50:52.240 align:start position:0%
famine and exploitation of millions of
 
05:50:55.830 --> 05:50:55.840 align:start position:0%
people while also not hating Jewish
 
05:50:59.708 --> 05:50:59.718 align:start position:0%
people I think that is very very obvious
 
05:51:03.310 --> 05:51:03.320 align:start position:0%
and um yeah it's literally just the
 
05:51:05.670 --> 05:51:05.680 align:start position:0%
freedom of political speech we I've
 
05:51:09.110 --> 05:51:09.120 align:start position:0%
grown up hearing Live Free or Die I dude
 
05:51:14.030 --> 05:51:14.040 align:start position:0%
like I'm so sick of the whole shtick of
 
05:51:16.110 --> 05:51:16.120 align:start position:0%
freedom and this and that oh just just
 
05:51:17.990 --> 05:51:18.000 align:start position:0%
get good grades just go to school and
 
05:51:19.788 --> 05:51:19.798 align:start position:0%
you'll go to college and you'll be able
 
05:51:22.270 --> 05:51:22.280 align:start position:0%
to get a house just like us and start a
 
05:51:24.230 --> 05:51:24.240 align:start position:0%
family that's we're all figuring out
 
05:51:26.670 --> 05:51:26.680 align:start position:0%
that that's total crap and and we're not
 
05:51:28.670 --> 05:51:28.680 align:start position:0%
just going to sit by and and let it
 
05:51:30.390 --> 05:51:30.400 align:start position:0%
happen I mean I'm
 
05:51:32.750 --> 05:51:32.760 align:start position:0%
glad that I knew that this was going on
 
05:51:34.628 --> 05:51:34.638 align:start position:0%
there's a whole lot of people in my age
 
05:51:37.430 --> 05:51:37.440 align:start position:0%
that feel the same way as as me and as
 
05:51:39.030 --> 05:51:39.040 align:start position:0%
these other people but don't even know
 
05:51:41.510 --> 05:51:41.520 align:start position:0%
that things like this are happening um
 
05:51:43.150 --> 05:51:43.160 align:start position:0%
so the last thing that we need is the
 
05:51:47.868 --> 05:51:47.878 align:start position:0%
suppression of nonviolent boycotts like
 
05:51:51.628 --> 05:51:51.638 align:start position:0%
in front of City Hall again nonviolent
 
05:51:57.830 --> 05:51:57.840 align:start position:0%
have signs chanting like can you get
 
05:52:01.628 --> 05:52:01.638 align:start position:0%
any what would be the alternative it's
 
05:52:03.430 --> 05:52:03.440 align:start position:0%
exactly like that the last person was
 
05:52:05.190 --> 05:52:05.200 align:start position:0%
saying it's almost like you're
 
05:52:07.590 --> 05:52:07.600 align:start position:0%
incentivizing of of violent protest
 
05:52:08.830 --> 05:52:08.840 align:start position:0%
because if you're left with no other
 
05:52:11.750 --> 05:52:11.760 align:start position:0%
choice people are still angry people are
 
05:52:13.270 --> 05:52:13.280 align:start position:0%
not going to change their minds just
 
05:52:15.230 --> 05:52:15.240 align:start position:0%
because money isn't flowing to them not
 
05:52:17.548 --> 05:52:17.558 align:start position:0%
everyone makes up their mind based on
 
05:52:19.948 --> 05:52:19.958 align:start position:0%
how much cash is in their pockets and
 
05:52:22.590 --> 05:52:22.600 align:start position:0%
I'm really sick of realizing growing up
 
05:52:24.468 --> 05:52:24.478 align:start position:0%
and realizing that that's literally what
 
05:52:26.110 --> 05:52:26.120 align:start position:0%
drives every single force in this
 
05:52:29.830 --> 05:52:29.840 align:start position:0%
country I mean all the anti-boycott laws
 
05:52:31.468 --> 05:52:31.478 align:start position:0%
that are around the country right now
 
05:52:33.670 --> 05:52:33.680 align:start position:0%
which I was reading I think 220 million
 
05:52:36.468 --> 05:52:36.478 align:start position:0%
Americans which is about 78% of americ
 
05:52:39.590 --> 05:52:39.600 align:start position:0%
am an live in places where there are
 
05:52:42.628 --> 05:52:42.638 align:start position:0%
already anti-b boycotting laws that's
 
05:52:45.750 --> 05:52:45.760 align:start position:0%
literally insane to me that's insane I
 
05:52:48.070 --> 05:52:48.080 align:start position:0%
don't understand how you can hear that
 
05:52:50.190 --> 05:52:50.200 align:start position:0%
and not think that's insane when we are
 
05:52:52.350 --> 05:52:52.360 align:start position:0%
the land of the free and Home of the
 
05:52:52.360 --> 05:52:55.150 align:start position:0%
the land of the free and Home of the
Brave

05:52:55.150 --> 05:52:55.160 align:start position:0%
Brave
 
05:52:59.030 --> 05:52:59.040 align:start position:0%
um yeah um I don't know I'm going to I
 
05:53:00.990 --> 05:53:01.000 align:start position:0%
guess read something really quick that I
 
05:53:03.548 --> 05:53:03.558 align:start position:0%
I said to the Manchester Board of Mayor
 
05:53:05.430 --> 05:53:05.440 align:start position:0%
and Alderman and it was about a
 
05:53:08.910 --> 05:53:08.920 align:start position:0%
ceasefire resolution then it's not this
 
05:53:11.430 --> 05:53:11.440 align:start position:0%
paragraph doesn't really touch upon that
 
05:53:13.190 --> 05:53:13.200 align:start position:0%
citizens around the world have been
 
05:53:14.750 --> 05:53:14.760 align:start position:0%
conditioned to turn a blind eye to
 
05:53:16.948 --> 05:53:16.958 align:start position:0%
catastrophe and our ancient values of
 
05:53:18.670 --> 05:53:18.680 align:start position:0%
connectedness to our communities and to
 
05:53:20.708 --> 05:53:20.718 align:start position:0%
the Earth have been replaced by self-
 
05:53:22.948 --> 05:53:22.958 align:start position:0%
entitlement in the endless compulsion to
 
05:53:25.270 --> 05:53:25.280 align:start position:0%
consume we are moths drawn to the flame
 
05:53:27.390 --> 05:53:27.400 align:start position:0%
of industrialization and it's burning us
 
05:53:30.030 --> 05:53:30.040 align:start position:0%
all up the majority of us mostly the
 
05:53:31.948 --> 05:53:31.958 align:start position:0%
older Generations have slipped into a
 
05:53:33.910 --> 05:53:33.920 align:start position:0%
sense of false Comfort inside a system
 
05:53:35.868 --> 05:53:35.878 align:start position:0%
that exploits the working class for
 
05:53:37.788 --> 05:53:37.798 align:start position:0%
everything we have but leaves us with
 
05:53:40.230 --> 05:53:40.240 align:start position:0%
scraps because it's all we've ever known
 
05:53:42.468 --> 05:53:42.478 align:start position:0%
someone please explain to me how natural
 
05:53:44.830 --> 05:53:44.840 align:start position:0%
complex systems have sustained on Earth
 
05:53:47.110 --> 05:53:47.120 align:start position:0%
for Millennia yet the modern Homo Sapien
 
05:53:48.868 --> 05:53:48.878 align:start position:0%
is convinced he knows better based on
 
05:53:50.070 --> 05:53:50.080 align:start position:0%
these past 200 years of
 
05:53:51.948 --> 05:53:51.958 align:start position:0%
industrialization and the glorification
 
05:53:54.628 --> 05:53:54.638 align:start position:0%
of rugged individualism if you ask me
 
05:53:56.270 --> 05:53:56.280 align:start position:0%
the ongoing promotion of rugged
 
05:53:58.310 --> 05:53:58.320 align:start position:0%
individualism within a hierarchial
 
05:54:00.910 --> 05:54:00.920 align:start position:0%
society in which very few possess more
 
05:54:02.590 --> 05:54:02.600 align:start position:0%
money and power than millions of us
 
05:54:04.948 --> 05:54:04.958 align:start position:0%
combined it's simply or it's simply
 
05:54:06.670 --> 05:54:06.680 align:start position:0%
something to keep taxpayers on their
 
05:54:10.350 --> 05:54:10.360 align:start position:0%
hamster wheels I'm I'm sick of this crap
 
05:54:12.868 --> 05:54:12.878 align:start position:0%
a lot of people are sick of this crap
 
05:54:15.110 --> 05:54:15.120 align:start position:0%
the state divesting what does that have
 
05:54:16.430 --> 05:54:16.440 align:start position:0%
to do with this
 
05:54:18.910 --> 05:54:18.920 align:start position:0%
bill what does it not have to do with
 
05:54:21.708 --> 05:54:21.718 align:start position:0%
this bill this bill prohibits a
 
05:54:25.548 --> 05:54:25.558 align:start position:0%
discriminatory boycotts of Israel but
 
05:54:27.670 --> 05:54:27.680 align:start position:0%
then it also says no that's
 
05:54:31.030 --> 05:54:31.040 align:start position:0%
anti-Semitism but then it's also
 
05:54:33.030 --> 05:54:33.040 align:start position:0%
anti-israeli government like can we
 
05:54:34.788 --> 05:54:34.798 align:start position:0%
actually separate these things
 
05:54:37.468 --> 05:54:37.478 align:start position:0%
anti-Semitism is being anti-jewish
 
05:54:41.150 --> 05:54:41.160 align:start position:0%
people being anti-israeli government in
 
05:54:43.670 --> 05:54:43.680 align:start position:0%
anti-israeli government policies is a
 
05:54:47.270 --> 05:54:47.280 align:start position:0%
completely different thing so
 
05:54:50.030 --> 05:54:50.040 align:start position:0%
different thank you that's all you got
 
05:54:52.190 --> 05:54:52.200 align:start position:0%
to say to me real sweet thank you for

05:55:13.350 --> 05:55:13.360 align:start position:0%
um would you equate not buying Nike
 
05:55:16.270 --> 05:55:16.280 align:start position:0%
sneakers from that company because of a
 
05:55:20.670 --> 05:55:20.680 align:start position:0%
policy they have to a boycott of Israel
 
05:55:23.430 --> 05:55:23.440 align:start position:0%
is that is that a similar in your mind
 
05:55:24.868 --> 05:55:24.878 align:start position:0%
is that a
 
05:55:27.948 --> 05:55:27.958 align:start position:0%
similar um free
 
05:55:31.590 --> 05:55:31.600 align:start position:0%
speech uh expression of free speech I
 
05:55:34.070 --> 05:55:34.080 align:start position:0%
mean yeah I mean it's not really like
 
05:55:36.310 --> 05:55:36.320 align:start position:0%
Speech cuz you might not talk about it
 
05:55:38.510 --> 05:55:38.520 align:start position:0%
but like I've decided to stop buying
 
05:55:40.670 --> 05:55:40.680 align:start position:0%
McDonald's stop buying staru not that I
 
05:55:42.468 --> 05:55:42.478 align:start position:0%
was ever have Celiac I don't really buy

that crap anyways but like you can make
 
05:55:49.788 --> 05:55:49.798 align:start position:0%
decisions and have them be off of your
 
05:55:51.868 --> 05:55:51.878 align:start position:0%
morality and then not shove it down
 
05:55:54.548 --> 05:55:54.558 align:start position:0%
other people's throat and or you know
 
05:55:56.510 --> 05:55:56.520 align:start position:0%
make it illegal to do the opposite like
 
05:55:58.670 --> 05:55:58.680 align:start position:0%
I don't know yeah it's I I could choose
 
05:56:01.350 --> 05:56:01.360 align:start position:0%
not to buy Nikes because um first of all
 
05:56:03.670 --> 05:56:03.680 align:start position:0%
I'm broke I'll go to Savers and get some

like I'll get ones for five bucks at
 
05:56:07.948 --> 05:56:07.958 align:start position:0%
Savers I mean it's more sustainable I
 
05:56:09.670 --> 05:56:09.680 align:start position:0%
stopped buying fast fashion in general
 
05:56:11.670 --> 05:56:11.680 align:start position:0%

schmith has a question thank you madam
 
05:56:44.830 --> 05:56:44.840 align:start position:0%
chair so you were here I believe uh when
 
05:56:47.030 --> 05:56:47.040 align:start position:0%
Senator Bradley referenced that this
 
05:56:50.150 --> 05:56:50.160 align:start position:0%
bill is about codifying the governor's
 
05:56:52.310 --> 05:56:52.320 align:start position:0%
executive order
 
05:56:56.310 --> 05:56:56.320 align:start position:0%
from half a year ago yeah has anything
 
05:56:58.788 --> 05:56:58.798 align:start position:0%
changed uh with regard to the state of
 
05:57:03.190 --> 05:57:03.200 align:start position:0%
is Israel since then that might change
 
05:57:06.190 --> 05:57:06.200 align:start position:0%
the idea behind the governor's executive
 
05:57:08.590 --> 05:57:08.600 align:start position:0%
order uh yeah I think definitely things
 
05:57:12.030 --> 05:57:12.040 align:start position:0%
have changed yeah like October 7th
 
05:57:13.590 --> 05:57:13.600 align:start position:0%
happened and then in
 
05:57:16.070 --> 05:57:16.080 align:start position:0%
response we know what's going on I'm I'm
 
05:57:17.510 --> 05:57:17.520 align:start position:0%
not going to sit here and tell you all
 
05:57:18.948 --> 05:57:18.958 align:start position:0%
what's going on I hope to God that
 
05:57:20.990 --> 05:57:21.000 align:start position:0%
you're all educating yourselves on
 
05:57:22.788 --> 05:57:22.798 align:start position:0%
what's going on in the world since it's
 
05:57:26.868 --> 05:57:26.878 align:start position:0%
like your job but anyway yeah I mean but
 
05:57:29.788 --> 05:57:29.798 align:start position:0%
I also have to say like it's not just
 
05:57:31.788 --> 05:57:31.798 align:start position:0%
like an entire shift in perspective
 
05:57:34.150 --> 05:57:34.160 align:start position:0%
because of this one Massacre that's now
 
05:57:37.990 --> 05:57:38.000 align:start position:0%
been going on for five six months 7
 
05:57:40.868 --> 05:57:40.878 align:start position:0%
months like there's over 30,000 people
 
05:57:43.590 --> 05:57:43.600 align:start position:0%
dead like yeah that's a very very big
 
05:57:45.190 --> 05:57:45.200 align:start position:0%
thing to worry about but also there's
 
05:57:47.430 --> 05:57:47.440 align:start position:0%
been massacres before this against the
 
05:57:49.990 --> 05:57:50.000 align:start position:0%
Palestinian people um I mean I'm not
 
05:57:52.310 --> 05:57:52.320 align:start position:0%
going to I'm not going to yeah I'm not
 
05:57:54.150 --> 05:57:54.160 align:start position:0%
going to sit here and be like you know I
 
05:57:56.510 --> 05:57:56.520 align:start position:0%
know every single one but I can tell you
 
05:57:58.510 --> 05:57:58.520 align:start position:0%
for a fact it it didn't start with
 
05:58:00.590 --> 05:58:00.600 align:start position:0%
October 7th and I
 
05:58:03.190 --> 05:58:03.200 align:start position:0%
honestly I don't think it should matter
 
05:58:05.270 --> 05:58:05.280 align:start position:0%
when where who started it there's
 
05:58:08.030 --> 05:58:08.040 align:start position:0%
innocent people dying I think it's like
 
05:58:10.070 --> 05:58:10.080 align:start position:0%
totally justified to be freaked out
 
05:58:12.670 --> 05:58:12.680 align:start position:0%
about it if we weren't also exposed to
 
05:58:16.070 --> 05:58:16.080 align:start position:0%
like violence and media like we would
 
05:58:17.628 --> 05:58:17.638 align:start position:0%
all be we would see the footage of
 
05:58:19.468 --> 05:58:19.478 align:start position:0%
what's going on over there we'd either
 
05:58:21.948 --> 05:58:21.958 align:start position:0%
be lighting buildings on fire or like
 
05:58:25.110 --> 05:58:25.120 align:start position:0%
curled up in a ball crying like that
 
05:58:27.270 --> 05:58:27.280 align:start position:0%
that I should not have to open Instagram
 
05:58:30.110 --> 05:58:30.120 align:start position:0%
and see dead children and I'm not like
 
05:58:31.590 --> 05:58:31.600 align:start position:0%
I'll delete Instagram I know I have the
 
05:58:33.590 --> 05:58:33.600 align:start position:0%
freedom to do that I'm just saying like
 
05:58:36.788 --> 05:58:36.798 align:start position:0%
that's messed up I
 
05:58:38.990 --> 05:58:39.000 align:start position:0%
I if if this is all I can do about the
 
05:58:41.390 --> 05:58:41.400 align:start position:0%
dead children I see on my social media
 
05:58:44.948 --> 05:58:44.958 align:start position:0%
Pages then I'm going to do it and if if
 
05:58:44.958 --> 05:58:46.948 align:start position:0%
Pages then I'm going to do it and if if
boycotting

05:58:46.948 --> 05:58:46.958 align:start position:0%
boycotting
 
05:58:50.070 --> 05:58:50.080 align:start position:0%
non-violently uh a state and that is
 
05:58:53.390 --> 05:58:53.400 align:start position:0%
using its policies and its power to
 
05:58:55.670 --> 05:58:55.680 align:start position:0%
carry out a genocide and ethnic
 
05:58:58.628 --> 05:58:58.638 align:start position:0%
cleansing um yeah I think that's I think
 
05:59:00.070 --> 05:59:00.080 align:start position:0%
that makes a lot of sense to be angry
 
05:59:03.948 --> 05:59:03.958 align:start position:0%
about that or at least you know
 
05:59:06.990 --> 05:59:07.000 align:start position:0%
concerned yeah
 
05:59:08.830 --> 05:59:08.840 align:start position:0%
seems like you've been doing a lot of
 
05:59:12.270 --> 05:59:12.280 align:start position:0%
thinking uh the last couple years
 
05:59:14.430 --> 05:59:14.440 align:start position:0%

has been 2 and 1/2 months since we were
 
06:00:06.548 --> 06:00:06.558 align:start position:0%
last here testifying against this bill
 
06:00:08.310 --> 06:00:08.320 align:start position:0%
and in those 2 and a half months the
 
06:00:11.150 --> 06:00:11.160 align:start position:0%
level of violence cruelty destruction
 
06:00:11.160 --> 06:00:11.948 align:start position:0%
level of violence cruelty destruction
and

06:00:11.948 --> 06:00:11.958 align:start position:0%

the

06:00:15.350 --> 06:00:15.360 align:start position:0%

you this is concentrating on the bill
 
06:00:25.190 --> 06:00:25.200 align:start position:0%
because this bill is dealing with the
 
06:00:27.590 --> 06:00:27.600 align:start position:0%
state of Israel and it is concentrating
 
06:00:29.468 --> 06:00:29.478 align:start position:0%
on the bill to make sure that we are all
 
06:00:31.230 --> 06:00:31.240 align:start position:0%
aware of what the state of Israel is
 
06:00:33.830 --> 06:00:33.840 align:start position:0%
currently doing in Gaza right now so I
 
06:00:42.030 --> 06:00:42.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:44.548 --> 06:00:44.558 align:start position:0%
I we
 
06:00:47.750 --> 06:00:47.760 align:start position:0%
have please continue but I think that we
 
06:00:49.990 --> 06:00:50.000 align:start position:0%
need to concentrate on the actions of
 
06:00:52.390 --> 06:00:52.400 align:start position:0%
our state government because that's what
 
06:00:55.030 --> 06:00:55.040 align:start position:0%
we're here for so and I plan to speak to
 
06:00:57.788 --> 06:00:57.798 align:start position:0%
that as well thank
 
06:01:00.350 --> 06:01:00.360 align:start position:0%
you and in those two and a half months
 
06:01:02.350 --> 06:01:02.360 align:start position:0%
the level of violence cruelty
 
06:01:04.628 --> 06:01:04.638 align:start position:0%
destruction and inhumanity that we are
 
06:01:07.590 --> 06:01:07.600 align:start position:0%
witnessing Gaza has only increased
 
06:01:10.750 --> 06:01:10.760 align:start position:0%
exponentially as starvation is used as a
 
06:01:14.230 --> 06:01:14.240 align:start position:0%
weapon as desperate people are massacred
 
06:01:16.948 --> 06:01:16.958 align:start position:0%
over bags of flour as the targeted
 
06:01:19.190 --> 06:01:19.200 align:start position:0%
murder of Aid workers and First
 
06:01:22.150 --> 06:01:22.160 align:start position:0%
Responders only increases as we see
 
06:01:24.390 --> 06:01:24.400 align:start position:0%
evidence of the horrific atrocities at
 
06:01:27.190 --> 06:01:27.200 align:start position:0%
alifa hospital it is hard to believe
 
06:01:29.110 --> 06:01:29.120 align:start position:0%
that this bill is still being considered
 
06:01:32.948 --> 06:01:32.958 align:start position:0%
by this body we are now 6 months into a
 
06:01:35.270 --> 06:01:35.280 align:start position:0%
genocide that has been live streamed for
 
06:01:38.030 --> 06:01:38.040 align:start position:0%
the entire world to see that is being
 
06:01:41.150 --> 06:01:41.160 align:start position:0%
funded by our tax dollars and it is an
 
06:01:44.310 --> 06:01:44.320 align:start position:0%
evil thing that the only response of the
 
06:01:47.310 --> 06:01:47.320 align:start position:0%
government of this state to this moment
 
06:01:49.190 --> 06:01:49.200 align:start position:0%
is an attempt to crack down on the
 
06:01:51.990 --> 06:01:52.000 align:start position:0%
boycott of Israel a legitimate form of
 
06:01:54.510 --> 06:01:54.520 align:start position:0%
protest and free expression for any
 
06:01:56.868 --> 06:01:56.878 align:start position:0%
person or business of conscience who
 
06:01:58.948 --> 06:01:58.958 align:start position:0%
stands against the horrors we are
 
06:02:01.468 --> 06:02:01.478 align:start position:0%
currently witnessing in Gaza and the
 
06:02:04.270 --> 06:02:04.280 align:start position:0%
entirety of over 75 years of occupation
 
06:02:07.510 --> 06:02:07.520 align:start position:0%
that the Palestinian people have
 
06:02:09.468 --> 06:02:09.478 align:start position:0%
I urge this committee to understand the
 
06:02:11.590 --> 06:02:11.600 align:start position:0%
role that you play at this pivotal time
 
06:02:13.948 --> 06:02:13.958 align:start position:0%
in history the chance that you have
 
06:02:15.708 --> 06:02:15.718 align:start position:0%
right now to stand for something beyond
 
06:02:18.190 --> 06:02:18.200 align:start position:0%
the mundane politicking that seems to be
 
06:02:19.910 --> 06:02:19.920 align:start position:0%
the majority of what goes on in these
 
06:02:22.310 --> 06:02:22.320 align:start position:0%
Chambers to do what you can to throw
 
06:02:24.468 --> 06:02:24.478 align:start position:0%
sand into the Machinery of genocide even
 
06:02:26.990 --> 06:02:27.000 align:start position:0%
in the smallest way and to vote no on
 
06:02:30.990 --> 06:02:31.000 align:start position:0%
this Bill thank you thank

06:02:41.070 --> 06:02:41.080 align:start position:0%
prepared statement could you send it to

06:03:02.590 --> 06:03:02.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:05.390 --> 06:03:05.400 align:start position:0%
you um good afternoon my name is Maria
 
06:03:07.788 --> 06:03:07.798 align:start position:0%
so Kennedy um I'm from
 
06:03:10.510 --> 06:03:10.520 align:start position:0%
Lebanon uh New Hampshire I'm a law
 
06:03:12.708 --> 06:03:12.718 align:start position:0%
student and I'm graduating next month um
 
06:03:14.830 --> 06:03:14.840 align:start position:0%
I took time away from my coursework and
 
06:03:17.910 --> 06:03:17.920 align:start position:0%
I drove over an hour today to ask you to
 
06:03:19.868 --> 06:03:19.878 align:start position:0%
oppose SB
 
06:03:22.390 --> 06:03:22.400 align:start position:0%
439 this is a ridiculous and
 
06:03:24.708 --> 06:03:24.718 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional waste of this body's
 
06:03:27.830 --> 06:03:27.840 align:start position:0%
time and of taxpayer money if the state
 
06:03:31.150 --> 06:03:31.160 align:start position:0%
passes SB 439 and codifies the
 
06:03:33.230 --> 06:03:33.240 align:start position:0%
governor's order they might as well cut
 
06:03:35.150 --> 06:03:35.160 align:start position:0%
an enormous check to a civil liberties
 
06:03:35.160 --> 06:03:36.310 align:start position:0%
an enormous check to a civil liberties
organization

06:03:36.310 --> 06:03:36.320 align:start position:0%
organization
 
06:03:39.548 --> 06:03:39.558 align:start position:0%
legal organization like care or the ACLU
 
06:03:41.468 --> 06:03:41.478 align:start position:0%
that is because anti-boycott bills like
 
06:03:43.750 --> 06:03:43.760 align:start position:0%
this represent a blatant violation of
 
06:03:46.150 --> 06:03:46.160 align:start position:0%
our first amendment rights in fact I
 
06:03:47.510 --> 06:03:47.520 align:start position:0%
used to work with First Amendment
 
06:03:50.190 --> 06:03:50.200 align:start position:0%
lawyers and they referred to anti-bds
 
06:03:52.990 --> 06:03:53.000 align:start position:0%
bills as donation or fundraising bills
 
06:03:54.788 --> 06:03:54.798 align:start position:0%
because this type of legislation is so
 
06:03:57.110 --> 06:03:57.120 align:start position:0%
frequently introduced and is also so
 
06:03:58.910 --> 06:03:58.920 align:start position:0%
frequently judicially
 
06:04:01.150 --> 06:04:01.160 align:start position:0%
defeated I have to ask when there are so
 
06:04:03.548 --> 06:04:03.558 align:start position:0%
many issues New Hampshire residents face
 
06:04:05.670 --> 06:04:05.680 align:start position:0%
homelessness Rising costs in health
 
06:04:08.030 --> 06:04:08.040 align:start position:0%
healthare and education the opioid
 
06:04:10.270 --> 06:04:10.280 align:start position:0%
epidemic why the state would gamble with
 
06:04:12.628 --> 06:04:12.638 align:start position:0%
taxpayer money this way instead of
 
06:04:14.430 --> 06:04:14.440 align:start position:0%
investing in our communities this bill
 
06:04:16.868 --> 06:04:16.878 align:start position:0%
seeks to ensure that the state of Israel
 
06:04:18.590 --> 06:04:18.600 align:start position:0%
which is the largest recipient of US
 
06:04:20.708 --> 06:04:20.718 align:start position:0%
foreign aid receives even more of our
 
06:04:23.270 --> 06:04:23.280 align:start position:0%
financial support and this comes at the
 
06:04:25.830 --> 06:04:25.840 align:start position:0%
expense of local services and at a great
 
06:04:28.670 --> 06:04:28.680 align:start position:0%
cost to overburden State officials who
 
06:04:31.510 --> 06:04:31.520 align:start position:0%
will now have to screen and verify BDS
 
06:04:33.468 --> 06:04:33.478 align:start position:0%
activity by companies while overseeing
 
06:04:36.310 --> 06:04:36.320 align:start position:0%
State Investments and contracts
 
06:04:38.070 --> 06:04:38.080 align:start position:0%
finally I am shocked that New Hampshire
 
06:04:39.948 --> 06:04:39.958 align:start position:0%
is debating whether to sacrifice its
 
06:04:41.990 --> 06:04:42.000 align:start position:0%
residents Free Speech rights in order to
 
06:04:44.110 --> 06:04:44.120 align:start position:0%
privilege a foreign state currently
 
06:04:46.750 --> 06:04:46.760 align:start position:0%
committing genocide Israel has killed
 
06:04:49.990 --> 06:04:50.000 align:start position:0%
over 40,000 Palestinians in Gaza the us
 
06:04:51.788 --> 06:04:51.798 align:start position:0%
and our federal Representatives like
 
06:04:53.708 --> 06:04:53.718 align:start position:0%
Senators Hassen and Shaheen have
 
06:04:55.628 --> 06:04:55.638 align:start position:0%
supported and facilitated this mass
 
06:04:58.110 --> 06:04:58.120 align:start position:0%
murder if anything the state legislature
 
06:05:00.070 --> 06:05:00.080 align:start position:0%
should be doing everything it can to
 
06:05:01.910 --> 06:05:01.920 align:start position:0%
pressure our federal delegation to bring
 
06:05:04.590 --> 06:05:04.600 align:start position:0%
on an end to the ongoing Slaughter thank

06:05:08.750 --> 06:05:08.760 align:start position:0%

Campbell hello my name is Evelyn kle I'm
 
06:05:35.030 --> 06:05:35.040 align:start position:0%
from Lebanon and I'm here to oppose sen
 
06:05:38.390 --> 06:05:38.400 align:start position:0%
a bill 4 39 as it was defeated last year
 
06:05:40.548 --> 06:05:40.558 align:start position:0%
like this bill is an unacceptable attack
 
06:05:43.070 --> 06:05:43.080 align:start position:0%
on New Hampshire people and businesses
 
06:05:45.830 --> 06:05:45.840 align:start position:0%
ability to oppose genocide in Palestine
 
06:05:48.150 --> 06:05:48.160 align:start position:0%
it infringes on our expressive conduct
 
06:05:51.030 --> 06:05:51.040 align:start position:0%
and silences the explanatory speech this
 
06:05:53.430 --> 06:05:53.440 align:start position:0%
is an attack on both our first amendment
 
06:05:55.430 --> 06:05:55.440 align:start position:0%
rights to free speech and our 14th
 
06:05:57.990 --> 06:05:58.000 align:start position:0%

time to speak uh I'm dram Abu I'm a
 
06:08:00.990 --> 06:08:01.000 align:start position:0%
Palestinian American constituent of the
 
06:08:04.910 --> 06:08:04.920 align:start position:0%
State of New Hampshire I'm here today on
 
06:08:06.590 --> 06:08:06.600 align:start position:0%
which is one of the two major holidays
 
06:08:09.030 --> 06:08:09.040 align:start position:0%
in My Religion a holiday that is a
 
06:08:11.390 --> 06:08:11.400 align:start position:0%
somber reminder of loss and grief to
 
06:08:14.070 --> 06:08:14.080 align:start position:0%
everyone in GDA right now I'm testifying
 
06:08:16.070 --> 06:08:16.080 align:start position:0%
an opposition of New Hampshire State
 
06:08:19.310 --> 06:08:19.320 align:start position:0%
Bill 439 because I am deeply concerned
 
06:08:21.750 --> 06:08:21.760 align:start position:0%
about my family who are just trying to S
 
06:08:23.670 --> 06:08:23.680 align:start position:0%
survive the horror that is taking place
 
06:08:26.190 --> 06:08:26.200 align:start position:0%
right now in Reza and the West
 
06:08:28.628 --> 06:08:28.638 align:start position:0%
Bank the grounds for this legislation is
 
06:08:30.510 --> 06:08:30.520 align:start position:0%
to prevent discrimination and
 
06:08:32.990 --> 06:08:33.000 align:start position:0%
anti-Semitism however as many of us have
 
06:08:35.270 --> 06:08:35.280 align:start position:0%
seen anti-Semitism has become weaponized
 
06:08:37.788 --> 06:08:37.798 align:start position:0%
by Israel as a means to allow them to do
 
06:08:40.070 --> 06:08:40.080 align:start position:0%
whatever they so choose to Palestinians
 
06:08:42.910 --> 06:08:42.920 align:start position:0%
and pro Palestinians around the world
 
06:08:44.708 --> 06:08:44.718 align:start position:0%
definitions are important so please
 
06:08:46.788 --> 06:08:46.798 align:start position:0%
allow me to clarify that anti-Semitism
 
06:08:48.750 --> 06:08:48.760 align:start position:0%
means anyone who is against people that
 
06:08:51.430 --> 06:08:51.440 align:start position:0%
speak semetic languages which includes
 
06:08:53.548 --> 06:08:53.558 align:start position:0%
Arabic therefore this language is
 
06:08:55.270 --> 06:08:55.280 align:start position:0%
anti-Semitic as it is supporting an
 
06:08:58.150 --> 06:08:58.160 align:start position:0%
illegal apartheid state that murders and
 
06:09:00.830 --> 06:09:00.840 align:start position:0%
ethnically cleanses indigenous
 
06:09:03.628 --> 06:09:03.638 align:start position:0%
Arabs we should be able to criticize any
 
06:09:05.350 --> 06:09:05.360 align:start position:0%
government without conflation of disc
 
06:09:07.030 --> 06:09:07.040 align:start position:0%
discrimination of its
 
06:09:09.468 --> 06:09:09.478 align:start position:0%
people the boycott divestments and
 
06:09:12.030 --> 06:09:12.040 align:start position:0%
sanctions or BDS movement is the most
 
06:09:14.310 --> 06:09:14.320 align:start position:0%
powerful form of protest and removing
 
06:09:15.948 --> 06:09:15.958 align:start position:0%
this fundamental right is an attack on
 
06:09:18.628 --> 06:09:18.638 align:start position:0%
Free Speech as well as
 
06:09:20.910 --> 06:09:20.920 align:start position:0%
democracy in removing our ability to
 
06:09:23.190 --> 06:09:23.200 align:start position:0%
utilize BDS this legislation is
 
06:09:25.150 --> 06:09:25.160 align:start position:0%
extremely harmful towards individuals
 
06:09:26.910 --> 06:09:26.920 align:start position:0%
who are experiencing persecution
 
06:09:29.948 --> 06:09:29.958 align:start position:0%
oppression and genocide the US has not
 
06:09:31.788 --> 06:09:31.798 align:start position:0%
done this for a single other country
 
06:09:31.798 --> 06:09:32.868 align:start position:0%
done this for a single other country
including

06:09:32.868 --> 06:09:32.878 align:start position:0%
including

06:18:35.468 --> 06:18:35.478 align:start position:0%
anti-semitic um standing up for human
 
06:18:38.628 --> 06:18:38.638 align:start position:0%
rights for international law for free
 
06:18:41.948 --> 06:18:41.958 align:start position:0%
speech and for basic decency is not
 
06:18:44.430 --> 06:18:44.440 align:start position:0%
anti-semitic the Zionist political
 
06:18:47.150 --> 06:18:47.160 align:start position:0%
movement has taken over my religion and
 
06:18:52.150 --> 06:18:52.160 align:start position:0%
taken out God law ethics and culture and
 
06:18:54.270 --> 06:18:54.280 align:start position:0%
replace them with nationalism and
 
06:18:56.270 --> 06:18:56.280 align:start position:0%
allegiance to a particular
 
06:18:59.030 --> 06:18:59.040 align:start position:0%
country then it tries to legitimize
 
06:19:01.830 --> 06:19:01.840 align:start position:0%
Israel's atrocious Behavior by claiming
 
06:19:04.270 --> 06:19:04.280 align:start position:0%
that this represents Jewish interests
 
06:19:06.110 --> 06:19:06.120 align:start position:0%
and it keeps people afraid of speaking
 
06:19:08.310 --> 06:19:08.320 align:start position:0%
out lest they be called
 
06:19:10.670 --> 06:19:10.680 align:start position:0%
anti-semitic New Hampshire does not need
 
06:19:12.628 --> 06:19:12.638 align:start position:0%
to accept
 
06:19:16.468 --> 06:19:16.478 align:start position:0%
this um I'm very unhappy with some of
 
06:19:19.670 --> 06:19:19.680 align:start position:0%
the logic that this bill is using um to
 
06:19:22.230 --> 06:19:22.240 align:start position:0%
try to protect Israel from boycott at
 
06:19:24.750 --> 06:19:24.760 align:start position:0%
the cost of our Free
 
06:19:27.350 --> 06:19:27.360 align:start position:0%
Speech boycotting Israel is not
 
06:19:29.670 --> 06:19:29.680 align:start position:0%
discrimination against anyone it would
 
06:19:33.788 --> 06:19:33.798 align:start position:0%
be silly to argue that someone choosing
 
06:19:36.750 --> 06:19:36.760 align:start position:0%
to boycott country that was Christian or
 
06:19:39.190 --> 06:19:39.200 align:start position:0%
that was Muslim because of Human Rights
 
06:19:40.948 --> 06:19:40.958 align:start position:0%
abuses is discriminating against
 
06:19:43.750 --> 06:19:43.760 align:start position:0%
Christian or Muslim people or that
 
06:19:46.430 --> 06:19:46.440 align:start position:0%
boycotting Russian or Chinese goods for
 
06:19:48.910 --> 06:19:48.920 align:start position:0%
human rights reasons is discriminating
 
06:19:51.708 --> 06:19:51.718 align:start position:0%
against Russian or Chinese people and
 
06:19:54.708 --> 06:19:54.718 align:start position:0%
it's similarly silly to claim that a
 
06:19:56.868 --> 06:19:56.878 align:start position:0%
boycott against Israel constitutes
 
06:19:59.070 --> 06:19:59.080 align:start position:0%
discrimination against Jews or any group
 
06:20:01.830 --> 06:20:01.840 align:start position:0%
of people in New
 
06:20:04.190 --> 06:20:04.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire at the senate committee
 
06:20:06.990 --> 06:20:07.000 align:start position:0%
hearing on this bill a senator asked a
 
06:20:09.350 --> 06:20:09.360 align:start position:0%
testifier whether she believes Israel
 
06:20:11.670 --> 06:20:11.680 align:start position:0%
has the right to
 
06:20:15.110 --> 06:20:15.120 align:start position:0%
exist criticism of Israel's human rights
 
06:20:17.788 --> 06:20:17.798 align:start position:0%
abuses is often put down by saying well
 
06:20:19.788 --> 06:20:19.798 align:start position:0%
Israel has a right to
 
06:20:22.548 --> 06:20:22.558 align:start position:0%
exist as if violating human rights and
 
06:20:25.110 --> 06:20:25.120 align:start position:0%
international law please con please
 
06:20:27.910 --> 06:20:27.920 align:start position:0%
concentrate on on the bill we we don't
 
06:20:30.628 --> 06:20:30.638 align:start position:0%
need to know what convinced the Senate
 
06:20:33.548 --> 06:20:33.558 align:start position:0%
to to go forward with it okay thank you
 
06:20:38.468 --> 06:20:38.478 align:start position:0%

holiday please let me finish there's a
 
06:22:14.830 --> 06:22:14.840 align:start position:0%
major point over here a year ago
 
06:22:16.910 --> 06:22:16.920 align:start position:0%
children were buying new clothes for the
 
06:22:21.070 --> 06:22:21.080 align:start position:0%
holiday this year children are in burial
 
06:22:23.628 --> 06:22:23.638 align:start position:0%
shrouds on this holiday I say this to
 
06:22:26.468 --> 06:22:26.478 align:start position:0%
say that this bill is being heard on Eid
 
06:22:28.628 --> 06:22:28.638 align:start position:0%
the Muslim holiday a day when many
 
06:22:30.190 --> 06:22:30.200 align:start position:0%
people who are Muslim in the state who
 
06:22:32.990 --> 06:22:33.000 align:start position:0%
are directly affected by this bill again
 
06:22:35.230 --> 06:22:35.240 align:start position:0%
a bill that says that businesses that
 
06:22:38.150 --> 06:22:38.160 align:start position:0%
support Palestinian protest that are you
 
06:22:40.030 --> 06:22:40.040 align:start position:0%
know BDS against Israel again many
 
06:22:42.230 --> 06:22:42.240 align:start position:0%
Muslims in this state have a say in this
 
06:22:44.788 --> 06:22:44.798 align:start position:0%
have a stake in this debate this hearing
 
06:22:46.548 --> 06:22:46.558 align:start position:0%
is on the Muslim holiday it's the same
 
06:22:48.548 --> 06:22:48.558 align:start position:0%
as if you this bill was being heard on
 
06:22:50.350 --> 06:22:50.360 align:start position:0%
Christmas right how many people could
 
06:22:51.750 --> 06:22:51.760 align:start position:0%
make it in that circumstance so I really
 
06:22:53.110 --> 06:22:53.120 align:start position:0%
want this to be something if you can
 
06:22:55.190 --> 06:22:55.200 align:start position:0%
flag this for the Dei committee for the
 
06:22:57.868 --> 06:22:57.878 align:start position:0%
future uh just I'm sure it was an
 
06:22:59.430 --> 06:22:59.440 align:start position:0%
accident I'm sure like you know it
 
06:23:01.110 --> 06:23:01.120 align:start position:0%
happens there's so many dates but if you
 
06:23:02.670 --> 06:23:02.680 align:start position:0%
be flagged for the Dei committee because
 
06:23:04.510 --> 06:23:04.520 align:start position:0%
again it affects Muslim residents of the
 
06:23:06.548 --> 06:23:06.558 align:start position:0%
State directly quite often I would
 
06:23:08.590 --> 06:23:08.600 align:start position:0%
really really greatly appreciate that
 
06:23:10.468 --> 06:23:10.478 align:start position:0%
now to to add to that okay I am a
 
06:23:13.750 --> 06:23:13.760 align:start position:0%
ethnically Jewish Muslim American I work
 
06:23:15.628 --> 06:23:15.638 align:start position:0%
with Palestinian students I work with
 
06:23:16.670 --> 06:23:16.680 align:start position:0%
many students who want to start
 
06:23:17.990 --> 06:23:18.000 align:start position:0%
businesses in the state who want to do
 
06:23:20.030 --> 06:23:20.040 align:start position:0%
work in the state and their work they
 
06:23:21.830 --> 06:23:21.840 align:start position:0%
Envision they they want to be involved
 
06:23:23.590 --> 06:23:23.600 align:start position:0%
in boycott they want to be able to
 
06:23:25.750 --> 06:23:25.760 align:start position:0%
express their economic free speech and
 
06:23:28.310 --> 06:23:28.320 align:start position:0%
for this state house to not give them
 
06:23:29.670 --> 06:23:29.680 align:start position:0%
that ability to to say that we're not
 
06:23:31.110 --> 06:23:31.120 align:start position:0%
going to work with you if you do this in
 
06:23:32.910 --> 06:23:32.920 align:start position:0%
the future it economically damages our
 
06:23:36.030 --> 06:23:36.040 align:start position:0%
state frankly it is a blatant violation
 
06:23:39.230 --> 06:23:39.240 align:start position:0%
of free speech and I really really hope
 
06:23:40.628 --> 06:23:40.638 align:start position:0%
and I know last year when it came to
 
06:23:43.350 --> 06:23:43.360 align:start position:0%
this committee uh you know it didn't
 
06:23:44.830 --> 06:23:44.840 align:start position:0%
move past the committee I really hope
 
06:23:46.830 --> 06:23:46.840 align:start position:0%
it's the case again this year uh because
 
06:23:48.590 --> 06:23:48.600 align:start position:0%
it's strange to be here again A year
 
06:23:51.708 --> 06:23:51.718 align:start position:0%
later after so much more has happened
 
06:23:53.788 --> 06:23:53.798 align:start position:0%
and to and to see how in nearby States
 
06:23:55.830 --> 06:23:55.840 align:start position:0%
we've seen Palestinian protesters in
 
06:23:58.150 --> 06:23:58.160 align:start position:0%
Burlington be physically harmed and now
 
06:24:00.070 --> 06:24:00.080 align:start position:0%
to say that economically there's
 
06:24:01.670 --> 06:24:01.680 align:start position:0%
restrictions on what they're able to do
 
06:24:03.150 --> 06:24:03.160 align:start position:0%
I really really hope that it does not
 
06:24:05.270 --> 06:24:05.280 align:start position:0%
move past this committee and I thank you
 
06:24:07.070 --> 06:24:07.080 align:start position:0%
for your time and I'm sorry to have
 
06:24:08.230 --> 06:24:08.240 align:start position:0%
stopped you from saying that over there
 
06:24:09.708 --> 06:24:09.718 align:start position:0%
against the holiday you know it's an
 
06:24:12.390 --> 06:24:12.400 align:start position:0%
emotional day I appreciate it thank you

06:24:16.708 --> 06:24:16.718 align:start position:0%
the the list of holidays to the I will
 
06:24:19.030 --> 06:24:19.040 align:start position:0%

06:24:21.548 --> 06:24:21.558 align:start position:0%

06:24:23.110 --> 06:24:23.120 align:start position:0%

06:24:24.910 --> 06:24:24.920 align:start position:0%

New Hampshire I sent you a long detail

get statements so I don't want to repeat
 
06:25:07.788 --> 06:25:07.798 align:start position:0%
that but I wanted to add a little
 
06:25:10.788 --> 06:25:10.798 align:start position:0%
context uh and also to say that I
 
06:25:12.510 --> 06:25:12.520 align:start position:0%
understand the impetus for this bill and
 
06:25:16.990 --> 06:25:17.000 align:start position:0%
a way to protect me a and mine um and uh
 
06:25:18.590 --> 06:25:18.600 align:start position:0%
I haven't really slept well since
 
06:25:22.468 --> 06:25:22.478 align:start position:0%
October 7th um uh but I speak in strong
 
06:25:24.390 --> 06:25:24.400 align:start position:0%
opposition to this bill I was born and
 
06:25:26.110 --> 06:25:26.120 align:start position:0%
grew up in New York City not that long
 
06:25:28.868 --> 06:25:28.878 align:start position:0%
after the Holocaust wiped out most of my
 
06:25:31.430 --> 06:25:31.440 align:start position:0%
uh family my parents sent me and my
 
06:25:34.310 --> 06:25:34.320 align:start position:0%
older sister to an Orthodox Jewish Day
 
06:25:36.750 --> 06:25:36.760 align:start position:0%
school and I had to take public
 
06:25:38.510 --> 06:25:38.520 align:start position:0%
transportation back and forth and I
 
06:25:40.548 --> 06:25:40.558 align:start position:0%
still remember the scowl on the face of
 
06:25:42.910 --> 06:25:42.920 align:start position:0%
the public uh
 
06:25:46.468 --> 06:25:46.478 align:start position:0%
Q7 bus driver uh where he would open the
 
06:25:49.750 --> 06:25:49.760 align:start position:0%
door shout out and just drive by
 
06:25:52.390 --> 06:25:52.400 align:start position:0%
without stopping the bus I was it was
 
06:25:55.708 --> 06:25:55.718 align:start position:0%
not until I was 15 that I and my family
 
06:25:57.830 --> 06:25:57.840 align:start position:0%
uh could go to so-called exclusive
 
06:26:00.230 --> 06:26:00.240 align:start position:0%
Resorts such as Wentworth by the Sea
 
06:26:02.708 --> 06:26:02.718 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire uh exclusive meant
 
06:26:05.468 --> 06:26:05.478 align:start position:0%
that it excluded people like like me uh
 
06:26:07.150 --> 06:26:07.160 align:start position:0%
so we've had a lot of progress but I
 
06:26:08.830 --> 06:26:08.840 align:start position:0%
still experienced a lot of
 
06:26:11.788 --> 06:26:11.798 align:start position:0%
anti-Semitic uh incidents and with that
 
06:26:14.390 --> 06:26:14.400 align:start position:0%
discrimination uh background it felt
 
06:26:16.468 --> 06:26:16.478 align:start position:0%
like a life-saving miracle that there
 
06:26:18.590 --> 06:26:18.600 align:start position:0%
was this country formed the day year
 
06:26:21.110 --> 06:26:21.120 align:start position:0%
before I was born uh with our ancient
 
06:26:23.350 --> 06:26:23.360 align:start position:0%
Homeland like walking through the Bible
 
06:26:25.910 --> 06:26:25.920 align:start position:0%
where Jews with a majority and where we
 
06:26:28.670 --> 06:26:28.680 align:start position:0%
would be equal and where my Israeli
 
06:26:32.510 --> 06:26:32.520 align:start position:0%
cousins miraculously were taller more
 
06:26:36.510 --> 06:26:36.520 align:start position:0%
athletic more uh uh uh Stronger looking
 
06:26:41.110 --> 06:26:41.120 align:start position:0%
than uh me and my uh e Exile cousins uh
 
06:26:43.788 --> 06:26:43.798 align:start position:0%
Israel as your text your bill says as
 
06:26:47.590 --> 06:26:47.600 align:start position:0%
many great wonders and ancient and Tech
 
06:26:50.750 --> 06:26:50.760 align:start position:0%
Modern and technological high-tech um
 
06:26:56.468 --> 06:26:56.478 align:start position:0%
and um but as I've reflected more on
 
06:26:59.310 --> 06:26:59.320 align:start position:0%
this uh equality that I had I could
 
06:27:03.270 --> 06:27:03.280 align:start position:0%
become an instant citizen of Israel uh
 
06:27:05.590 --> 06:27:05.600 align:start position:0%
anyone with one Jewish grandparent can
 
06:27:08.070 --> 06:27:08.080 align:start position:0%
become a citizen of Israel and by God I
 
06:27:09.708 --> 06:27:09.718 align:start position:0%
had all
 
06:27:12.948 --> 06:27:12.958 align:start position:0%
four and but that is but then what that
 
06:27:15.750 --> 06:27:15.760 align:start position:0%
means is that this is discrimination in
 
06:27:19.190 --> 06:27:19.200 align:start position:0%
my favor and it's uh discrimination
 
06:27:21.548 --> 06:27:21.558 align:start position:0%
against people who living there and
 
06:27:25.270 --> 06:27:25.280 align:start position:0%
those people support and about the bill
 
06:27:27.070 --> 06:27:27.080 align:start position:0%
those many of those people support a
 
06:27:30.788 --> 06:27:30.798 align:start position:0%
boycott because of Israel illegally
 
06:27:33.708 --> 06:27:33.718 align:start position:0%
occupying uh West Bank and East
 
06:27:38.230 --> 06:27:38.240 align:start position:0%
Jerusalem for 56 years and as uh Amnesty
 
06:27:40.670 --> 06:27:40.680 align:start position:0%
International and Human Rights group and
 
06:27:43.190 --> 06:27:43.200 align:start position:0%
the Israeli Human Rights group at selum
 
06:27:44.948 --> 06:27:44.958 align:start position:0%
which means in the image in the image of
 
06:27:49.468 --> 06:27:49.478 align:start position:0%
God and uh hundreds of uh whistleblower
 
06:27:52.390 --> 06:27:52.400 align:start position:0%
soldiers IDF soldiers talk about massive
 
06:27:56.070 --> 06:27:56.080 align:start position:0%
discri discrimination and uh you know it
 
06:27:58.510 --> 06:27:58.520 align:start position:0%
took many many of us maybe longer than
 
06:28:01.628 --> 06:28:01.638 align:start position:0%
it should have to realize this this uh
 
06:28:07.070 --> 06:28:07.080 align:start position:0%
status and U you have in uh I mean the
 
06:28:08.948 --> 06:28:08.958 align:start position:0%
what you're prohibiting is people in
 
06:28:11.590 --> 06:28:11.600 align:start position:0%
this bill if it were to pass you would
 
06:28:14.510 --> 06:28:14.520 align:start position:0%
prohibit people uh against checkpoints
 
06:28:17.310 --> 06:28:17.320 align:start position:0%
travel bans Jews only roads nighttime
 
06:28:19.590 --> 06:28:19.600 align:start position:0%
home invasions threats and verbal abuse
 
06:28:22.510 --> 06:28:22.520 align:start position:0%
arbitrary arrest beatings EXT digal
 
06:28:24.788 --> 06:28:24.798 align:start position:0%
killing this bill is about New Hampshire
 
06:28:27.190 --> 06:28:27.200 align:start position:0%
I'm afraid we don't well you're limiting
 
06:28:29.230 --> 06:28:29.240 align:start position:0%
people in New Hampshire
 
06:28:32.990 --> 06:28:33.000 align:start position:0%
from from uh joining this B and I
 
06:28:35.350 --> 06:28:35.360 align:start position:0%
personally at this moment have not
 
06:28:36.868 --> 06:28:36.878 align:start position:0%
joined the boycot but I certainly
 
06:28:38.628 --> 06:28:38.638 align:start position:0%
recognize the rights of people to do
 
06:28:40.788 --> 06:28:40.798 align:start position:0%
that as a form of nonviolent protests
 
06:28:42.310 --> 06:28:42.320 align:start position:0%
and also in terms of the protection of
 
06:28:44.628 --> 06:28:44.638 align:start position:0%
me when you eliminate as other people
 
06:28:46.910 --> 06:28:46.920 align:start position:0%
have said the opportunity for people to
 
06:28:48.990 --> 06:28:49.000 align:start position:0%
protest non-violently as happened in
 
06:28:51.830 --> 06:28:51.840 align:start position:0%
South Africa uh you make you put me in
 
06:28:55.230 --> 06:28:55.240 align:start position:0%
mine at at at greater risk because then
 
06:28:57.628 --> 06:28:57.638 align:start position:0%
we are more targeted for the only form
 
06:29:00.230 --> 06:29:00.240 align:start position:0%
of protest that allows now and I
 
06:29:04.110 --> 06:29:04.120 align:start position:0%
detailed some background of that also as
 
06:29:07.030 --> 06:29:07.040 align:start position:0%
has been hinted out here um one of the
 
06:29:09.070 --> 06:29:09.080 align:start position:0%
reasons there's a sharp rise in
 
06:29:11.310 --> 06:29:11.320 align:start position:0%
so-called anti-semitic
 
06:29:14.750 --> 06:29:14.760 align:start position:0%
incidents in in uh in the country and
 
06:29:17.190 --> 06:29:17.200 align:start position:0%
the world is because groups like the
 
06:29:20.990 --> 06:29:21.000 align:start position:0%
Anti-Defamation League Define anyone who
 
06:29:23.468 --> 06:29:23.478 align:start position:0%
asks who supports the boycott or Pro who
 
06:29:26.430 --> 06:29:26.440 align:start position:0%
asks for a ceased fire or uses from The
 
06:29:28.708 --> 06:29:28.718 align:start position:0%
River To The Sea phrase as being
 
06:29:30.868 --> 06:29:30.878 align:start position:0%
anti-semitic so I don't think those are
 
06:29:33.750 --> 06:29:33.760 align:start position:0%
anti-semitic and I think this I I think
 
06:29:36.670 --> 06:29:36.680 align:start position:0%
this bill is actually more anti-semitic
 
06:29:39.628 --> 06:29:39.638 align:start position:0%
because it puts me and and other Jews
 
06:29:42.350 --> 06:29:42.360 align:start position:0%
and also interestingly archaeological
 
06:29:44.468 --> 06:29:44.478 align:start position:0%
digs show that Palestinians and Jews
 
06:29:47.110 --> 06:29:47.120 align:start position:0%
have common DNA we are our we are
 
06:29:50.430 --> 06:29:50.440 align:start position:0%
Semitic people and the Peace of Israelis
 
06:29:52.788 --> 06:29:52.798 align:start position:0%
Israeli Jews and the Peace of
 
06:29:54.948 --> 06:29:54.958 align:start position:0%
Palestinians are intertwined we cannot
 
06:29:58.110 --> 06:29:58.120 align:start position:0%
really be safe alone without the other
 
06:30:00.070 --> 06:30:00.080 align:start position:0%
being being safe and some of the
 
06:30:02.628 --> 06:30:02.638 align:start position:0%
high-tech wonders as we've we learned in
 
06:30:05.070 --> 06:30:05.080 align:start position:0%
recent days in Israel have been used to
 
06:30:08.468 --> 06:30:08.478 align:start position:0%
use AI to identify targets and to kill
 
06:30:10.670 --> 06:30:10.680 align:start position:0%
whole families and the neighbors so I I
 
06:30:14.190 --> 06:30:14.200 align:start position:0%
strongly urge you uh not to uh support
 
06:30:16.230 --> 06:30:16.240 align:start position:0%
this bill to let people have free
 
06:30:18.670 --> 06:30:18.680 align:start position:0%
association and free views and to work
 
06:30:22.150 --> 06:30:22.160 align:start position:0%
for a stronger more just world where we
 
06:30:24.510 --> 06:30:24.520 align:start position:0%
are we are protected by protecting each
 
06:30:27.670 --> 06:30:27.680 align:start position:0%
other thank you very much thank you and
 
06:30:29.190 --> 06:30:29.200 align:start position:0%
I'm sure representative Schmidt would
 
06:30:32.910 --> 06:30:32.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:30:37.350 --> 06:30:37.360 align:start position:0%
test if representative Dolan and then
 
06:30:40.548 --> 06:30:40.558 align:start position:0%
Brown thank you madam chair um and thank
 
06:30:44.150 --> 06:30:44.160 align:start position:0%
you for taking a question as a
 
06:30:48.070 --> 06:30:48.080 align:start position:0%
professor um I'm curious to know what
 
06:30:51.270 --> 06:30:51.280 align:start position:0%
you are currently teaching your students
 
06:30:55.750 --> 06:30:55.760 align:start position:0%
about things like this and do do you are
 
06:30:58.270 --> 06:30:58.280 align:start position:0%
you discussing Hamas and how they
 
06:31:00.070 --> 06:31:00.080 align:start position:0%
started this mess that we find ourselves
 
06:31:02.548 --> 06:31:02.558 align:start position:0%
in representative billan could we please
 
06:31:05.990 --> 06:31:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:31:08.350 --> 06:31:08.360 align:start position:0%
so should I respond to that question if
 
06:31:11.430 --> 06:31:11.440 align:start position:0%
you can briefly I'm sure we're we're all
 
06:31:15.788 --> 06:31:15.798 align:start position:0%
fascinated well since I'm uh retired I'm
 
06:31:18.070 --> 06:31:18.080 align:start position:0%
my teaching at the moment is directed
 
06:31:20.350 --> 06:31:20.360 align:start position:0%
more at
 
06:31:22.948 --> 06:31:22.958 align:start position:0%
you and I you know I like to have not
 
06:31:24.468 --> 06:31:24.478 align:start position:0%
just five minutes but at least 50
 
06:31:26.430 --> 06:31:26.440 align:start position:0%
minutes prefer an hour and 20 or two
 
06:31:28.270 --> 06:31:28.280 align:start position:0%
hours so but we can communicate that
 
06:31:31.388 --> 06:31:31.398 align:start position:0%
later but uh what I try in in in my
 
06:31:33.190 --> 06:31:33.200 align:start position:0%
teaching what I try to do is teach
 
06:31:35.910 --> 06:31:35.920 align:start position:0%
Concepts that help people understand uh
 
06:31:38.270 --> 06:31:38.280 align:start position:0%
the interaction one of them with
 
06:31:40.670 --> 06:31:40.680 align:start position:0%
Israel uh and Hamas is actually to look
 
06:31:43.628 --> 06:31:43.638 align:start position:0%
at it as a relationship where how they
 
06:31:45.270 --> 06:31:45.280 align:start position:0%
each bring out in the other the very
 
06:31:47.230 --> 06:31:47.240 align:start position:0%
thing they claim they do not want to
 
06:31:49.868 --> 06:31:49.878 align:start position:0%
have and they give each other the
 
06:31:52.388 --> 06:31:52.398 align:start position:0%
necessary uh provocation to keep
 
06:31:54.548 --> 06:31:54.558 align:start position:0%
attacking each other so it's also it's
 
06:31:57.510 --> 06:31:57.520 align:start position:0%
almost like applying a marital therapy
 
06:32:01.310 --> 06:32:01.320 align:start position:0%
concept to uh where often the couple
 
06:32:03.310 --> 06:32:03.320 align:start position:0%
agrees on the facts but not who starts
 
06:32:06.670 --> 06:32:06.680 align:start position:0%
each inter action he drinks a lot he and
 
06:32:09.388 --> 06:32:09.398 align:start position:0%
she nags him she says he drinks so I nag
 
06:32:12.350 --> 06:32:12.360 align:start position:0%
him he says I nag him she he said she
 
06:32:14.150 --> 06:32:14.160 align:start position:0%
nags me so I drink and they just keep
 
06:32:16.310 --> 06:32:16.320 align:start position:0%
increasing that spiral and that's what
 
06:32:18.590 --> 06:32:18.600 align:start position:0%
part of what uh can explain a lot of
 
06:32:20.670 --> 06:32:20.680 align:start position:0%
things that happen with a MOS but Israel
 
06:32:23.310 --> 06:32:23.320 align:start position:0%
Israel started Hamas as a way of
 
06:32:25.270 --> 06:32:25.280 align:start position:0%
splitting the Palestinians and having a
 
06:32:27.868 --> 06:32:27.878 align:start position:0%
poster child yes for why no peace was
 
06:32:29.030 --> 06:32:29.040 align:start position:0%
possible and they wouldn't have to give
 
06:32:30.990 --> 06:32:31.000 align:start position:0%
up the land so we look at conceptual
 
06:32:32.788 --> 06:32:32.798 align:start position:0%
things in in that country and in other
 
06:32:35.468 --> 06:32:35.478 align:start position:0%
countries around the world
 
06:32:38.110 --> 06:32:38.120 align:start position:0%
and I'm accessible to provide a lot more
 
06:32:40.310 --> 06:32:40.320 align:start position:0%
information if people want by phone or
 
06:32:44.310 --> 06:32:44.320 align:start position:0%
by writing and I I I deeply footnoted
 
06:32:47.110 --> 06:32:47.120 align:start position:0%
what I sent you with a rich set of stuff
 
06:32:48.590 --> 06:32:48.600 align:start position:0%
to dig
 
06:32:51.230 --> 06:32:51.240 align:start position:0%
into uh thank you madam chair certainly
 
06:32:52.830 --> 06:32:52.840 align:start position:0%
if you think it's not if it's not
 
06:32:54.750 --> 06:32:54.760 align:start position:0%
related let me
 
06:32:57.110 --> 06:32:57.120 align:start position:0%
know going back to the question I asked
 
06:32:59.868 --> 06:32:59.878 align:start position:0%
the first young man that came up here I
 
06:33:02.030 --> 06:33:02.040 align:start position:0%
I really need clarified by you or
 
06:33:06.110 --> 06:33:06.120 align:start position:0%
someone if I decide to boycott Nike
 
06:33:11.190 --> 06:33:11.200 align:start position:0%
because I don't like their policy on
 
06:33:15.270 --> 06:33:15.280 align:start position:0%
whatever is that the same as boycotting
 
06:33:16.708 --> 06:33:16.718 align:start position:0%
let me let me back up a little bit
 
06:33:20.150 --> 06:33:20.160 align:start position:0%
there's one piece can you tell me
 
06:33:22.430 --> 06:33:22.440 align:start position:0%
boycotting of Israel is that just a
 
06:33:24.110 --> 06:33:24.120 align:start position:0%
statement that I don't agree with them
 
06:33:27.590 --> 06:33:27.600 align:start position:0%
or is that an effort to hurt the
 
06:33:30.110 --> 06:33:30.120 align:start position:0%
country in some way or another those are
 
06:33:32.030 --> 06:33:32.040 align:start position:0%
two different things to me right well I
 
06:33:34.510 --> 06:33:34.520 align:start position:0%
think different PE I think
 
06:33:36.910 --> 06:33:36.920 align:start position:0%
the motivations vary because this is an
 
06:33:39.948 --> 06:33:39.958 align:start position:0%
opportunity but the the the use the part
 
06:33:41.510 --> 06:33:41.520 align:start position:0%
of it that I think all of us who have
 
06:33:44.110 --> 06:33:44.120 align:start position:0%
been spoken against the bill share is
 
06:33:46.750 --> 06:33:46.760 align:start position:0%
that people who want to try to change
 
06:33:48.830 --> 06:33:48.840 align:start position:0%
bad policies and move things toward a
 
06:33:52.948 --> 06:33:52.958 align:start position:0%
more peaceful tomorrow uh want to use a
 
06:33:56.510 --> 06:33:56.520 align:start position:0%
nonviolent means of protesting uh
 
06:33:59.510 --> 06:33:59.520 align:start position:0%
rampant violations of international law
 
06:34:02.788 --> 06:34:02.798 align:start position:0%
and take away the power of violent uh
 
06:34:06.670 --> 06:34:06.680 align:start position:0%
violent protest in you know in 2018 2019
 
06:34:09.750 --> 06:34:09.760 align:start position:0%
there was Hamas did a nonviolent protest
 
06:34:12.310 --> 06:34:12.320 align:start position:0%
where they simply marched to the Border
 
06:34:15.430 --> 06:34:15.440 align:start position:0%
uh of Gaza and Israeli snipers killed
 
06:34:17.788 --> 06:34:17.798 align:start position:0%
over 200 of them and wounded many many
 
06:34:20.270 --> 06:34:20.280 align:start position:0%
others so that taught them nonviolence
 
06:34:22.510 --> 06:34:22.520 align:start position:0%
is not an option we need as many
 
06:34:25.750 --> 06:34:25.760 align:start position:0%
nonviolent options as as we can and this
 
06:34:28.110 --> 06:34:28.120 align:start position:0%
bill is working against that and it's
 
06:34:30.750 --> 06:34:30.760 align:start position:0%
not uh it's not it's not the way to go
 
06:34:32.468 --> 06:34:32.478 align:start position:0%
we want to leave people freedom of
 
06:34:34.468 --> 06:34:34.478 align:start position:0%
Association freedom of as freedom of
 
06:34:36.350 --> 06:34:36.360 align:start position:0%
action for multiple
 
06:34:39.750 --> 06:34:39.760 align:start position:0%
motivations but Let Freedom Ring thank
 
06:34:43.708 --> 06:34:43.718 align:start position:0%
you thank you representative
 
06:34:47.270 --> 06:34:47.280 align:start position:0%
Schmidt thank you Madame chairman so I
 
06:34:48.788 --> 06:34:48.798 align:start position:0%
believe you were here at the beginning
 
06:34:51.788 --> 06:34:51.798 align:start position:0%
when Senator Bradley was introducing his
 
06:34:55.030 --> 06:34:55.040 align:start position:0%
bill um and I reference the fact that
 
06:34:58.868 --> 06:34:58.878 align:start position:0%
that the first page references
 
06:34:58.878 --> 06:35:00.468 align:start position:0%
that the first page references
anti-Semitism

06:35:00.468 --> 06:35:00.478 align:start position:0%
anti-Semitism
 
06:35:04.350 --> 06:35:04.360 align:start position:0%
repeatedly um he said that this bill
 
06:35:04.360 --> 06:35:05.190 align:start position:0%
repeatedly um he said that this bill
is

06:35:05.190 --> 06:35:05.200 align:start position:0%
is
 
06:35:09.548 --> 06:35:09.558 align:start position:0%
to is to codify the
 
06:35:12.830 --> 06:35:12.840 align:start position:0%
governor's executive order back
 
06:35:17.708 --> 06:35:17.718 align:start position:0%
then um six months have happened in the
 
06:35:22.468 --> 06:35:22.478 align:start position:0%
meantime so if if the
 
06:35:24.388 --> 06:35:24.398 align:start position:0%
situation has
 
06:35:28.548 --> 06:35:28.558 align:start position:0%
changed and if uh if there are other
 
06:35:33.150 --> 06:35:33.160 align:start position:0%
ways of other reasons for opposing
 
06:35:33.160 --> 06:35:34.230 align:start position:0%
ways of other reasons for opposing
Israeli

06:35:34.230 --> 06:35:34.240 align:start position:0%
Israeli
 
06:35:38.468 --> 06:35:38.478 align:start position:0%
policy or the policy of the government
 
06:35:38.478 --> 06:35:39.350 align:start position:0%
policy or the policy of the government
of

06:35:39.350 --> 06:35:39.360 align:start position:0%
of
 
06:35:44.708 --> 06:35:44.718 align:start position:0%
Israel uh would that in any way be
 
06:35:47.190 --> 06:35:47.200 align:start position:0%
anti-semitic not at all and that's again
 
06:35:48.750 --> 06:35:48.760 align:start position:0%
with this odd thing
 
06:35:48.760 --> 06:35:50.270 align:start position:0%
with this odd thing
that

06:35:50.270 --> 06:35:50.280 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:35:53.430 --> 06:35:53.440 align:start position:0%
an anti-Semitism has become broadly
 
06:35:55.708 --> 06:35:55.718 align:start position:0%
expanded to include anyone who raises
 
06:35:59.230 --> 06:35:59.240 align:start position:0%
any question about an Israeli
 
06:36:01.110 --> 06:36:01.120 align:start position:0%
government's policies and Israel you
 
06:36:05.270 --> 06:36:05.280 align:start position:0%
know we Israel is not the isra of yak
 
06:36:10.030 --> 06:36:10.040 align:start position:0%
Rabin and uh uh and uh the peacemakers
 
06:36:14.030 --> 06:36:14.040 align:start position:0%
and uh Shimon perz Israel now is led by
 
06:36:17.388 --> 06:36:17.398 align:start position:0%
ministers who agree that yak Rabin was
 
06:36:19.548 --> 06:36:19.558 align:start position:0%
appropriately assassinated because he
 
06:36:21.510 --> 06:36:21.520 align:start position:0%
was going to give away land that God
 
06:36:24.548 --> 06:36:24.558 align:start position:0%
gave to the Jews and uh thank you for
 
06:36:26.628 --> 06:36:26.638 align:start position:0%
answering I'll just say you see I'll
 
06:36:29.468 --> 06:36:29.478 align:start position:0%
just say one final horrifying thing many
 
06:36:31.468 --> 06:36:31.478 align:start position:0%
of the in the government see October 7th
 
06:36:32.948 --> 06:36:32.958 align:start position:0%
as the opportunity they've been waiting
 
06:36:37.990 --> 06:36:38.000 align:start position:0%
for to De make Gaza uh uninhabitable and
 
06:36:40.388 --> 06:36:40.398 align:start position:0%
to reestablish Jewish settlements and
 
06:36:43.070 --> 06:36:43.080 align:start position:0%
land given to them by God this is not a
 
06:36:44.750 --> 06:36:44.760 align:start position:0%
this is not a philosophy I think New
 
06:36:47.468 --> 06:36:47.478 align:start position:0%
Hampshire wants to
 
06:36:49.510 --> 06:36:49.520 align:start position:0%

we've um I had the luxury of living uh
 
06:37:35.910 --> 06:37:35.920 align:start position:0%
living and learning in the state of
 
06:37:39.310 --> 06:37:39.320 align:start position:0%
Israel and there's a lot of things when
 
06:37:41.190 --> 06:37:41.200 align:start position:0%
you actually have been there and you've
 
06:37:43.430 --> 06:37:43.440 align:start position:0%
seen things understanding what's going
 
06:37:46.830 --> 06:37:46.840 align:start position:0%
on makes a lot more sense the uh
 
06:37:48.990 --> 06:37:49.000 align:start position:0%
Palestinian Christian Community have
 
06:37:53.868 --> 06:37:53.878 align:start position:0%
reached out to the world and to to on to
 
06:37:56.548 --> 06:37:56.558 align:start position:0%
for BDS which is this what this bill is
 
06:37:59.628 --> 06:37:59.638 align:start position:0%
about this bill is discussing BDS and is
 
06:38:02.430 --> 06:38:02.440 align:start position:0%
and saying we to to prevent any state
 
06:38:05.030 --> 06:38:05.040 align:start position:0%
contracts the BDS movement was started
 
06:38:07.310 --> 06:38:07.320 align:start position:0%
by the Palestinians and it's reaching
 
06:38:10.310 --> 06:38:10.320 align:start position:0%
out and saying we need a we want peace
 
06:38:12.948 --> 06:38:12.958 align:start position:0%
and to P they have put the Christian
 
06:38:15.190 --> 06:38:15.200 align:start position:0%
Palestinian Community has put together
 
06:38:18.388 --> 06:38:18.398 align:start position:0%
the BDS and to pull from their statement
 
06:38:20.310 --> 06:38:20.320 align:start position:0%
that they made the Kiros doc which is
 
06:38:21.990 --> 06:38:22.000 align:start position:0%
the word of Christian Palestinians to
 
06:38:23.468 --> 06:38:23.478 align:start position:0%
the world about what's happening in the
 
06:38:26.388 --> 06:38:26.398 align:start position:0%
state of state of Israel the Palestinian
 
06:38:28.670 --> 06:38:28.680 align:start position:0%
Christians asks us to engage in boycots
 
06:38:30.468 --> 06:38:30.478 align:start position:0%
device and sanctions against the Israeli
 
06:38:32.548 --> 06:38:32.558 align:start position:0%
occupation they asked us to put pressure
 
06:38:34.310 --> 06:38:34.320 align:start position:0%
on Israel to take uh measure legal
 
06:38:35.868 --> 06:38:35.878 align:start position:0%
measures to obligate his government to
 
06:38:38.468 --> 06:38:38.478 align:start position:0%
end its disregard and they seek to end
 
06:38:40.910 --> 06:38:40.920 align:start position:0%
the existing e evil to liberate both
 
06:38:43.708 --> 06:38:43.718 align:start position:0%
perator and victims of Injustice this
 
06:38:47.830 --> 06:38:47.840 align:start position:0%
bill claims aims to prevent
 
06:38:50.468 --> 06:38:50.478 align:start position:0%
anti-Semitism but it is actually the the
 
06:38:53.388 --> 06:38:53.398 align:start position:0%
breeding ground of anti-Semitism this
 
06:38:55.548 --> 06:38:55.558 align:start position:0%
you know you know the state of Israel
 
06:38:57.190 --> 06:38:57.200 align:start position:0%
has a strong propaganda machine they
 
06:38:59.868 --> 06:38:59.878 align:start position:0%
make outlandish claims of and their
 
06:39:01.910 --> 06:39:01.920 align:start position:0%
crimes and as long as someone buys into
 
06:39:04.910 --> 06:39:04.920 align:start position:0%
the claim even as until it's debunked it
 
06:39:06.868 --> 06:39:06.878 align:start position:0%
allows them to Foster their crimes this
 
06:39:09.788 --> 06:39:09.798 align:start position:0%
is the point of BDS is to actually call
 
06:39:12.030 --> 06:39:12.040 align:start position:0%
this out and to St it in a peaceful
 
06:39:14.910 --> 06:39:14.920 align:start position:0%
manner Senate Bill 439 claims that New
 
06:39:16.750 --> 06:39:16.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is benefits from dealings with
 
06:39:19.388 --> 06:39:19.398 align:start position:0%
the state of Israel but these benefits
 
06:39:22.230 --> 06:39:22.240 align:start position:0%
are spying in surveillance they aid in
 
06:39:24.070 --> 06:39:24.080 align:start position:0%
the suppression of protest distance and
 
06:39:25.990 --> 06:39:26.000 align:start position:0%
healthy political discourse the things
 
06:39:27.868 --> 06:39:27.878 align:start position:0%
that we're trying to just do here and
 
06:39:29.628 --> 06:39:29.638 align:start position:0%
today these benefits are useful in
 
06:39:32.310 --> 06:39:32.320 align:start position:0%
totalitarian regime and not in
 
06:39:32.320 --> 06:39:35.948 align:start position:0%
totalitarian regime and not in
democracy

06:39:35.948 --> 06:39:35.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:39:38.830 --> 06:39:38.840 align:start position:0%
the state of Israel does not represent
 
06:39:41.788 --> 06:39:41.798 align:start position:0%
the Jewish people the Bale say talks
 
06:39:45.708 --> 06:39:45.718 align:start position:0%
about uh preventing seism and this is a
 
06:39:48.708 --> 06:39:48.718 align:start position:0%
political entity and I with many rabbis
 
06:39:50.430 --> 06:39:50.440 align:start position:0%
and Jewish voice for peace and many
 
06:39:52.190 --> 06:39:52.200 align:start position:0%
other organizations
 
06:39:56.230 --> 06:39:56.240 align:start position:0%
asked to actually do the be to support
 
06:39:58.030 --> 06:39:58.040 align:start position:0%
the BDS movement and this Veil is
 
06:40:00.230 --> 06:40:00.240 align:start position:0%
explicitly trying to silence
 
06:40:03.430 --> 06:40:03.440 align:start position:0%
us our Jewish brothers and Christians in
 
06:40:05.510 --> 06:40:05.520 align:start position:0%
the Holy Land are asking us for this
 
06:40:08.070 --> 06:40:08.080 align:start position:0%
request and it's our obligations as
 
06:40:09.788 --> 06:40:09.798 align:start position:0%
fellow citizens of the world of a
 
06:40:12.310 --> 06:40:12.320 align:start position:0%
community this will affect us here
 
06:40:14.590 --> 06:40:14.600 align:start position:0%

06:40:36.680 --> 06:40:38.350 align:start position:0%
 
good

06:40:38.350 --> 06:40:38.360 align:start position:0%
good
 
06:40:41.270 --> 06:40:41.280 align:start position:0%
afternoon my name is Saia Ahmed I'm a
 
06:40:43.190 --> 06:40:43.200 align:start position:0%
resident of Lebanon New Hampshire and
 
06:40:45.830 --> 06:40:45.840 align:start position:0%
I'm a Staff attorney at Palestine legal
 
06:40:47.788 --> 06:40:47.798 align:start position:0%
I'm here today to voice my opposition to
 
06:40:50.150 --> 06:40:50.160 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 439 which threatens to keep
 
06:40:52.230 --> 06:40:52.240 align:start position:0%
companies who boycott Israel from
 
06:40:53.910 --> 06:40:53.920 align:start position:0%
receiving State funding and completely
 
06:40:55.750 --> 06:40:55.760 align:start position:0%
mischaracterizes the boycott movement in
 
06:40:57.670 --> 06:40:57.680 align:start position:0%
support of Palestine as a movement for
 
06:41:00.590 --> 06:41:00.600 align:start position:0%
hate s SP 439 seeks to prohibit
 
06:41:02.628 --> 06:41:02.638 align:start position:0%
businesses that choose to boycott Israel
 
06:41:04.548 --> 06:41:04.558 align:start position:0%
from receiving State Investments and
 
06:41:07.388 --> 06:41:07.398 align:start position:0%
contracts in a nutshell what this bill
 
06:41:10.708 --> 06:41:10.718 align:start position:0%
is attempting to do is to silence speech

government restrictions like this cannot
 
06:41:22.750 --> 06:41:22.760 align:start position:0%
be based on the desire to punish or curb

06:41:42.510 --> 06:41:42.520 align:start position:0%
said that government officials
 
06:41:44.708 --> 06:41:44.718 align:start position:0%
determinations about what constitutes an
 
06:41:47.750 --> 06:41:47.760 align:start position:0%

right to freely Express their political
 
06:41:53.708 --> 06:41:53.718 align:start position:0%
views this is what SB 439 is attempting
 
06:41:56.788 --> 06:41:56.798 align:start position:0%
to do it wants to quash speech that its
 
06:42:00.230 --> 06:42:00.240 align:start position:0%
drafters disagree with by making sure
 
06:42:01.948 --> 06:42:01.958 align:start position:0%
that anyone who disagrees with them
 
06:42:04.110 --> 06:42:04.120 align:start position:0%
faces Financial
 
06:42:06.590 --> 06:42:06.600 align:start position:0%
consequences boycotts based on issues of
 
06:42:08.830 --> 06:42:08.840 align:start position:0%
ethical concern also Run Deep in our
 
06:42:11.430 --> 06:42:11.440 align:start position:0%
history as a country boycotts to oppose
 
06:42:13.350 --> 06:42:13.360 align:start position:0%
racial segregation or apartheid South
 
06:42:15.670 --> 06:42:15.680 align:start position:0%
Africa for example why would boycotts
 
06:42:18.430 --> 06:42:18.440 align:start position:0%
for Palestinian rights be treated any
 
06:42:20.548 --> 06:42:20.558 align:start position:0%
differently what this legislation would
 
06:42:23.548 --> 06:42:23.558 align:start position:0%
do is Chill speech in New Hampshire is
 
06:42:25.948 --> 06:42:25.958 align:start position:0%
that what this body is trying to do it
 
06:42:27.468 --> 06:42:27.478 align:start position:0%
would tell New Hampshire residents like
 
06:42:29.628 --> 06:42:29.638 align:start position:0%
myself that if we speak out for human
 
06:42:31.510 --> 06:42:31.520 align:start position:0%
rights we could be held accountable we
 
06:42:33.670 --> 06:42:33.680 align:start position:0%
could face consequences
 
06:42:35.510 --> 06:42:35.520 align:start position:0%
this bill is aimed at businesses and the
 
06:42:38.070 --> 06:42:38.080 align:start position:0%
Free Speech rights of business owners
 
06:42:40.910 --> 06:42:40.920 align:start position:0%
but its implications will not stop there
 
06:42:42.868 --> 06:42:42.878 align:start position:0%
similar laws have been misrepresented
 
06:42:45.388 --> 06:42:45.398 align:start position:0%
and abused in order to chill activism in
 
06:42:47.868 --> 06:42:47.878 align:start position:0%
support of Palestine in general to
 
06:42:49.990 --> 06:42:50.000 align:start position:0%
cancel cultural events to prevent public
 
06:42:52.468 --> 06:42:52.478 align:start position:0%
talks at universities your actions in
 
06:42:54.670 --> 06:42:54.680 align:start position:0%
supporting this one bill could have
 
06:42:56.750 --> 06:42:56.760 align:start position:0%
devastating consequences beyond what
 
06:42:58.468 --> 06:42:58.478 align:start position:0%
this bill is even aimed to
 
06:43:01.430 --> 06:43:01.440 align:start position:0%
do lastly SP
 
06:43:05.150 --> 06:43:05.160 align:start position:0%
439 also also wholly relies on
 
06:43:09.388 --> 06:43:09.398 align:start position:0%
falsehoods Section 1 v15 describes the
 
06:43:11.388 --> 06:43:11.398 align:start position:0%
movement for boycotting Israel as a
 
06:43:14.708 --> 06:43:14.718 align:start position:0%
quote unquote dedicated hate movement s
 
06:43:17.510 --> 06:43:17.520 align:start position:0%
SP 439 grossly uses this lie as a
 
06:43:20.070 --> 06:43:20.080 align:start position:0%
premise to justify silencing speech in
 
06:43:22.310 --> 06:43:22.320 align:start position:0%
support of Palestinian rights the
 
06:43:23.910 --> 06:43:23.920 align:start position:0%
movement to boycott Israel let's be
 
06:43:26.230 --> 06:43:26.240 align:start position:0%
clear is not a hate movement it is a
 
06:43:28.310 --> 06:43:28.320 align:start position:0%
Grassroots movement for people to use
 
06:43:30.788 --> 06:43:30.798 align:start position:0%
their individual financial decisions to
 
06:43:32.590 --> 06:43:32.600 align:start position:0%
avoid complicity in the Israeli
 
06:43:34.628 --> 06:43:34.638 align:start position:0%
government's actions and to use their
 
06:43:36.468 --> 06:43:36.478 align:start position:0%
Collective economic pressure to
 
06:43:39.030 --> 06:43:39.040 align:start position:0%

06:43:40.590 --> 06:43:40.600 align:start position:0%
discriminatory
 
06:43:44.270 --> 06:43:44.280 align:start position:0%
practices SB 439 then goes on to
 
06:43:45.350 --> 06:43:45.360 align:start position:0%
reference the definition of
 
06:43:47.230 --> 06:43:47.240 align:start position:0%
anti-semitism under the international
 
06:43:49.070 --> 06:43:49.080 align:start position:0%
Holocaust remembrance act or otherwise
 
06:43:51.230 --> 06:43:51.240 align:start position:0%
known as Ira which conflates
 
06:43:52.868 --> 06:43:52.878 align:start position:0%
anti-zionism with
 
06:43:55.030 --> 06:43:55.040 align:start position:0%
anti-Semitism this legislature needs to
 
06:43:57.750 --> 06:43:57.760 align:start position:0%
be very clear it is a protected right to
 
06:43:59.708 --> 06:43:59.718 align:start position:0%
be able to express anti-zionist
 
06:44:02.230 --> 06:44:02.240 align:start position:0%
political views one's views against a
 
06:44:06.150 --> 06:44:06.160 align:start position:0%
political entity like Israel SP 439
 
06:44:08.350 --> 06:44:08.360 align:start position:0%
illegally attempts to infringe on that
 
06:44:10.990 --> 06:44:11.000 align:start position:0%
right freedom of speech a core tenant of
 
06:44:14.628 --> 06:44:14.638 align:start position:0%
our state and of our nation thank you
 
06:44:18.150 --> 06:44:18.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:44:22.590 --> 06:44:22.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:44:29.910 --> 06:44:29.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:44:33.230 --> 06:44:33.240 align:start position:0%

covered so many of these meetings and
 
06:44:50.030 --> 06:44:50.040 align:start position:0%
I've heard so many people repeat
 
06:44:52.948 --> 06:44:52.958 align:start position:0%
themselves so I know what you're going
 
06:44:57.708 --> 06:44:57.718 align:start position:0%
through um so I'm speaking here as a
 
06:44:59.548 --> 06:44:59.558 align:start position:0%
former business reporter for New
 
06:45:02.990 --> 06:45:03.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Business Review um the that
 
06:45:04.830 --> 06:45:04.840 align:start position:0%
can now speak out on issues because I'm
 
06:45:09.310 --> 06:45:09.320 align:start position:0%
no longer a reporter and um and also as
 
06:45:14.468 --> 06:45:14.478 align:start position:0%
a Jew who organized an A A an open
 
06:45:18.430 --> 06:45:18.440 align:start position:0%
letter uh against what Israel is doing
 
06:45:20.110 --> 06:45:20.120 align:start position:0%
um that's
 
06:45:25.110 --> 06:45:25.120 align:start position:0%
64 uh 67 Jews have signed on to in New
 
06:45:29.150 --> 06:45:29.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um so and this was in one
 
06:45:32.628 --> 06:45:32.638 align:start position:0%
week uh By Word of Mouth and by word of
 
06:45:36.468 --> 06:45:36.478 align:start position:0%
email now not not social media not going
 
06:45:39.070 --> 06:45:39.080 align:start position:0%
viral anything and this just was
 
06:45:39.080 --> 06:45:40.190 align:start position:0%
viral anything and this just was
released

06:45:40.190 --> 06:45:40.200 align:start position:0%
released
 
06:45:42.948 --> 06:45:42.958 align:start position:0%
today um and that was to the
 
06:45:46.070 --> 06:45:46.080 align:start position:0%
Congressional Delegation but back to the
 
06:45:46.080 --> 06:45:47.708 align:start position:0%
Congressional Delegation but back to the
bill

06:45:47.708 --> 06:45:47.718 align:start position:0%
bill
 
06:45:51.070 --> 06:45:51.080 align:start position:0%
um uh one thing I've learned as a
 
06:45:52.910 --> 06:45:52.920 align:start position:0%
reporter is businesses don't like
 
06:45:55.030 --> 06:45:55.040 align:start position:0%
government telling them what to
 
06:45:59.350 --> 06:45:59.360 align:start position:0%
do and this is telling businesses what
 
06:46:03.110 --> 06:46:03.120 align:start position:0%
to do it's not this that say don't do do
 
06:46:05.350 --> 06:46:05.360 align:start position:0%
this because you might hurt the public
 
06:46:07.150 --> 06:46:07.160 align:start position:0%
or don't do this because you might
 
06:46:10.150 --> 06:46:10.160 align:start position:0%
pollute the you know the air or don't do
 
06:46:12.708 --> 06:46:12.718 align:start position:0%
it's don't do this because we don't
 
06:46:15.270 --> 06:46:15.280 align:start position:0%
agree with your opinion and we're going
 
06:46:18.788 --> 06:46:18.798 align:start position:0%
to take your contracts away because we
 
06:46:21.388 --> 06:46:21.398 align:start position:0%
don't like what you're saying or what
 
06:46:23.830 --> 06:46:23.840 align:start position:0%
you're doing you said we we don't like
 
06:46:25.350 --> 06:46:25.360 align:start position:0%
the fact that you're not doing business
 
06:46:28.388 --> 06:46:28.398 align:start position:0%
with Israel so no contract we don't like
 
06:46:30.868 --> 06:46:30.878 align:start position:0%
the and it could do this with any
 
06:46:32.990 --> 06:46:33.000 align:start position:0%
country we don't like what you're you
 
06:46:34.868 --> 06:46:34.878 align:start position:0%
know if if you're not doing business in
 
06:46:36.990 --> 06:46:37.000 align:start position:0%
Canada for some reason you know we'll
 
06:46:38.150 --> 06:46:38.160 align:start position:0%
pull your
 
06:46:41.310 --> 06:46:41.320 align:start position:0%
contract I mean I think that's why you
 
06:46:43.670 --> 06:46:43.680 align:start position:0%
rejected this last time and I expect
 
06:46:47.030 --> 06:46:47.040 align:start position:0%
this why you're going to reject it again
 
06:46:49.948 --> 06:46:49.958 align:start position:0%
um I just want to say in terms of the
 
06:46:52.590 --> 06:46:52.600 align:start position:0%
anti-em this has been said many times by
 
06:46:57.110 --> 06:46:57.120 align:start position:0%
other people but just 67 Jews in New
 
06:46:59.270 --> 06:46:59.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and this just who found out
 
06:47:02.070 --> 06:47:02.080 align:start position:0%
about it are saying that what Israel is
 
06:47:03.388 --> 06:47:03.398 align:start position:0%
doing is wrong
 
06:47:05.150 --> 06:47:05.160 align:start position:0%
they're saying they want to ceasefire
 
06:47:09.270 --> 06:47:09.280 align:start position:0%
they want to cut off Aid um uh military
 
06:47:12.628 --> 06:47:12.638 align:start position:0%
aid to Israel and they want humanitarian
 
06:47:15.670 --> 06:47:15.680 align:start position:0%
Aid to get in there so there're are all
 
06:47:17.708 --> 06:47:17.718 align:start position:0%
these Jews anti-semitic because they're
 
06:47:17.718 --> 06:47:19.388 align:start position:0%
these Jews anti-semitic because they're
criticizing

06:47:19.388 --> 06:47:19.398 align:start position:0%
criticizing
 
06:47:21.990 --> 06:47:22.000 align:start position:0%
Israel are they
 
06:47:25.868 --> 06:47:25.878 align:start position:0%
self-hating I mean that's kind of what
 
06:47:28.350 --> 06:47:28.360 align:start position:0%
the the bill implies in its opening
 
06:47:31.628 --> 06:47:31.638 align:start position:0%
statement um that if you criticize
 
06:47:34.190 --> 06:47:34.200 align:start position:0%
Israel You're anti-Semitic and I think
 
06:47:37.190 --> 06:47:37.200 align:start position:0%
that's this is you know evidence that
 
06:47:38.548 --> 06:47:38.558 align:start position:0%
that's not
 
06:47:41.468 --> 06:47:41.478 align:start position:0%
true so that's all I have to say thank
 
06:47:43.070 --> 06:47:43.080 align:start position:0%
you I appreciate if you want I a
 
06:47:46.430 --> 06:47:46.440 align:start position:0%

06:47:51.150 --> 06:47:51.160 align:start position:0%
directly related to this but it shows
 
06:47:53.030 --> 06:47:53.040 align:start position:0%
the number of Jews that have opposed in
 
06:47:58.110 --> 06:47:58.120 align:start position:0%

madam here I'm here to introduce Senate
Bill

06:50:06.030 --> 06:50:06.040 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
06:50:08.590 --> 06:50:08.600 align:start position:0%
318 which is relative to the adoption of
 
06:50:11.468 --> 06:50:11.478 align:start position:0%
a social work ler
 
06:50:13.948 --> 06:50:13.958 align:start position:0%
compact I believe that this is very
 
06:50:17.110 --> 06:50:17.120 align:start position:0%
similar to the house bill that passed
 
06:50:19.750 --> 06:50:19.760 align:start position:0%
the house um although it left the
 
06:50:21.510 --> 06:50:21.520 align:start position:0%
committee without recommendation left
 
06:50:24.430 --> 06:50:24.440 align:start position:0%
the committee without recommendation and
 
06:50:28.070 --> 06:50:28.080 align:start position:0%
um I believe there are some people here
 
06:50:31.310 --> 06:50:31.320 align:start position:0%
from oplc who might be able to answer
 
06:50:33.150 --> 06:50:33.160 align:start position:0%
any questions but they may not be
 
06:50:36.948 --> 06:50:36.958 align:start position:0%
necessary no the um I have no no
 
06:50:41.708 --> 06:50:41.718 align:start position:0%

06:50:50.868 --> 06:50:50.878 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
06:50:54.830 --> 06:50:54.840 align:start position:0%
1190 which has a passed the house and is
 
06:50:55.708 --> 06:50:55.718 align:start position:0%
in the
 
06:50:59.190 --> 06:50:59.200 align:start position:0%
Senate and therefore we don't need to do
 
06:51:02.150 --> 06:51:02.160 align:start position:0%
anything with this and I'm going to T
 
06:51:04.230 --> 06:51:04.240 align:start position:0%

gohe
 
06:52:05.868 --> 06:52:05.878 align:start position:0%
this this amendment which completely
 
06:52:08.388 --> 06:52:08.398 align:start position:0%
replaces the unnecessary content of
 
06:52:10.708 --> 06:52:10.718 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill
 
06:52:10.718 --> 06:52:12.350 align:start position:0%

318
 
06:52:17.468 --> 06:52:17.478 align:start position:0%
is basically four sections from the
 
06:52:20.430 --> 06:52:20.440 align:start position:0%
amendment to House Bill
 
06:52:24.270 --> 06:52:24.280 align:start position:0%
1271 that the subcommittee works so hard
 
06:52:28.150 --> 06:52:28.160 align:start position:0%
on it does not address the Guardians at
 
06:52:33.670 --> 06:52:33.680 align:start position:0%
lium or the acupuncturists which were of
 
06:52:35.830 --> 06:52:35.840 align:start position:0%
concern to various members of the
 
06:52:39.708 --> 06:52:39.718 align:start position:0%
committee IT addresses the Manufacturing
 
06:52:39.718 --> 06:52:41.310 align:start position:0%
committee IT addresses the Manufacturing
Housing

06:52:41.310 --> 06:52:41.320 align:start position:0%
Housing
 
06:52:44.150 --> 06:52:44.160 align:start position:0%
installation board made
 
06:52:48.510 --> 06:52:48.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:52:51.190 --> 06:52:51.200 align:start position:0%
the uh what's the next
 
06:52:54.948 --> 06:52:54.958 align:start position:0%
part s the nursing home administrators
 
06:52:58.990 --> 06:52:59.000 align:start position:0%
board made advisory which is also not a
 
06:53:01.590 --> 06:53:01.600 align:start position:0%
problem and not strongly opposed by the
 
06:53:06.910 --> 06:53:06.920 align:start position:0%
board it it combines the boards of
 
06:53:09.910 --> 06:53:09.920 align:start position:0%
Massage Therapy
 
06:53:09.920 --> 06:53:11.990 align:start position:0%
Massage Therapy
and

06:53:11.990 --> 06:53:12.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:53:15.910 --> 06:53:15.920 align:start position:0%
uh raiki and other Asian Bodywork
 
06:53:18.708 --> 06:53:18.718 align:start position:0%
techniques at their request they're
 
06:53:20.788 --> 06:53:20.798 align:start position:0%
already an Advisory Board this just
 
06:53:24.070 --> 06:53:24.080 align:start position:0%
gives them a bit of a broader scope
 
06:53:26.948 --> 06:53:26.958 align:start position:0%
reflexology of course and then it
 
06:53:30.990 --> 06:53:31.000 align:start position:0%
deletes the registration of medical
 
06:53:33.350 --> 06:53:33.360 align:start position:0%
technicians because the medical
 
06:53:33.360 --> 06:53:35.030 align:start position:0%
technicians because the medical
technicians

06:53:35.030 --> 06:53:35.040 align:start position:0%
technicians
 
06:53:37.510 --> 06:53:37.520 align:start position:0%
didn't don't consider themselves
 
06:53:39.910 --> 06:53:39.920 align:start position:0%
Professionals in that way they haven't
 
06:53:42.030 --> 06:53:42.040 align:start position:0%
there's never been a board the board
 
06:53:44.708 --> 06:53:44.718 align:start position:0%
they've never been able to do anything
 
06:53:47.830 --> 06:53:47.840 align:start position:0%
and uh the subcommittee strongly felt
 
06:53:51.948 --> 06:53:51.958 align:start position:0%
that we didn't want to give people the
 
06:53:54.030 --> 06:53:54.040 align:start position:0%
illusion that we were regulating medical
 
06:53:57.350 --> 06:53:57.360 align:start position:0%
technicians when we actually weren't so
 
06:54:00.190 --> 06:54:00.200 align:start position:0%
this is as I said a small portion of
 
06:54:02.990 --> 06:54:03.000 align:start position:0%
what was in that Amendment um
 
06:54:03.948 --> 06:54:03.958 align:start position:0%
it should
 
06:54:07.270 --> 06:54:07.280 align:start position:0%
be relatively non-controversial and I
 
06:54:09.788 --> 06:54:09.798 align:start position:0%
hope you will support it thank you very
 
06:54:10.948 --> 06:54:10.958 align:start position:0%
much are there any questions yes
 
06:54:12.868 --> 06:54:12.878 align:start position:0%
representative leas yeah uh if I'm
 
06:54:14.750 --> 06:54:14.760 align:start position:0%
remembering correctly ask I'm asking if
 
06:54:15.750 --> 06:54:15.760 align:start position:0%
I'm remembering correctly that we
 
06:54:18.350 --> 06:54:18.360 align:start position:0%
actually got rid of the registration
 
06:54:20.270 --> 06:54:20.280 align:start position:0%
medical technicians and I think House
 
06:54:22.310 --> 06:54:22.320 align:start position:0%
Bill 1410 if I remembering the number
 
06:54:24.750 --> 06:54:24.760 align:start position:0%
right but since it was in this bill it
 
06:54:27.750 --> 06:54:27.760 align:start position:0%
had to be removed well we that this bill
 
06:54:30.150 --> 06:54:30.160 align:start position:0%
is in fact going to subcommittee because
 
06:54:32.628 --> 06:54:32.638 align:start position:0%
just because it's you know it's a the
 
06:54:34.230 --> 06:54:34.240 align:start position:0%
amendment we need to make sure that
 
06:54:37.030 --> 06:54:37.040 align:start position:0%
there aren't any stupid mistakes in it
 
06:54:38.868 --> 06:54:38.878 align:start position:0%
uh and that's one thing is we've already
 
06:54:40.708 --> 06:54:40.718 align:start position:0%
repealed that board we don't need to do
 
06:54:40.718 --> 06:54:41.468 align:start position:0%
repealed that board we don't need to do
it

06:54:41.468 --> 06:54:41.478 align:start position:0%

06:54:44.670 --> 06:54:44.680 align:start position:0%
twice okay thank you yeah I well sub
 
06:54:47.388 --> 06:54:47.398 align:start position:0%
commmittee can deal with it but yeah the
 
06:54:49.830 --> 06:54:49.840 align:start position:0%
intent is this is a small portion of
 
06:54:54.350 --> 06:54:54.360 align:start position:0%
that Amendment carefully selected to be
 
06:54:59.990 --> 06:55:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:55:03.788 --> 06:55:03.798 align:start position:0%
