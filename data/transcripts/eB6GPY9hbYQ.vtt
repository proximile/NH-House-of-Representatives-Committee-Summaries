health professionals in the state for
 
00:05:01.909 --> 00:05:01.919 align:start position:0%
their cooperation and assistance during
 
00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:04.600 align:start position:0%
the audit there was a lot of effort and
 
00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:08.000 align:start position:0%
coordination on this audit on their part
 
00:05:10.029 --> 00:05:10.039 align:start position:0%

presenting the audit report of the
 
00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:31.120 align:start position:0%
Mental Health licensing uh um of the uh
 
00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:33.800 align:start position:0%
mental health Workforce licensing audit
 
00:05:35.469 --> 00:05:35.479 align:start position:0%
um the purpose of our audit was to
 
00:05:37.189 --> 00:05:37.199 align:start position:0%
determine whether there were significant
 
00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:39.160 align:start position:0%
barriers to entry into the Mental Health
 
00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:41.440 align:start position:0%
Professions imposed by State Licensing
 
00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:43.680 align:start position:0%
boards during State fiscal year
 
00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:46.000 align:start position:0%
2022 our audit reviewed initial
 
00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:48.520 align:start position:0%
licensing requirements for 15 Mental
 
00:05:50.749 --> 00:05:50.759 align:start position:0%
Health Professions overseen by the
 
00:05:53.309 --> 00:05:53.319 align:start position:0%
boards of mental health practice
 
00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:55.600 align:start position:0%
psychologists licensing for alcohol and
 
00:05:58.270 --> 00:05:58.280 align:start position:0%

medicine and nursing
 
00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:02.560 align:start position:0%
we also reviewed oplc processes to
 
00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:05.880 align:start position:0%
determine their impact on initial
 
00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:08.560 align:start position:0%
licensing our executive summary starts
 
00:06:11.749 --> 00:06:11.759 align:start position:0%
on page one for most Mental Health
 
00:06:13.629 --> 00:06:13.639 align:start position:0%
Professions we found New Hampshire's
 
00:06:16.469 --> 00:06:16.479 align:start position:0%
education pre-license pre-licensed
 
00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:18.880 align:start position:0%
practice supervision and examination
 
00:06:21.029 --> 00:06:21.039 align:start position:0%
requirements generally aligned with
 
00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:23.240 align:start position:0%
those established by each profession's
 
00:06:25.670 --> 00:06:25.680 align:start position:0%
National Organization and for most
 
00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:27.280 align:start position:0%
professions we found New Hampshire's
 
00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:28.840 align:start position:0%
requirements were in the middle or
 
00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:30.720 align:start position:0%
slightly lower when compared to other
 
00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:32.400 align:start position:0%
states that we
 
00:06:34.510 --> 00:06:34.520 align:start position:0%
reviewed while we found statutes and
 
00:06:36.189 --> 00:06:36.199 align:start position:0%
rules did not impose substantial
 
00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:38.000 align:start position:0%
licensing barriers some board's
 
00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:40.000 align:start position:0%
procedures may have unnecessarily
 
00:06:42.189 --> 00:06:42.199 align:start position:0%
prolonged the application process and
 
00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:45.080 align:start position:0%
impeded streamlining for example some
 
00:06:47.350 --> 00:06:47.360 align:start position:0%
boards required case-by casee review of
 
00:06:49.189 --> 00:06:49.199 align:start position:0%
every application at a monthly board
 
00:06:51.749 --> 00:06:51.759 align:start position:0%
meeting regardless of the licensing risk
 
00:06:53.469 --> 00:06:53.479 align:start position:0%
posed which prolonged the time it took
 
00:06:55.869 --> 00:06:55.879 align:start position:0%
to get a license and reviewing all
 
00:06:57.749 --> 00:06:57.759 align:start position:0%
criminal convictions regardless of how
 
00:06:59.350 --> 00:06:59.360 align:start position:0%
long ago they occurred or whether
 
00:07:01.029 --> 00:07:01.039 align:start position:0%
whether they were substantially or
 
00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:03.440 align:start position:0%
directly related to the profession also
 
00:07:05.070 --> 00:07:05.080 align:start position:0%
hindered faster
 
00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:07.560 align:start position:0%
processing additionally mechanisms
 
00:07:09.430 --> 00:07:09.440 align:start position:0%
implemented by some boards to expedite
 
00:07:11.469 --> 00:07:11.479 align:start position:0%
licensing for individuals already
 
00:07:13.589 --> 00:07:13.599 align:start position:0%

00:07:15.469 --> 00:07:15.479 align:start position:0%
appear to save time or reduce

00:07:17.230 --> 00:07:17.240 align:start position:0%
documentation
 
00:07:20.070 --> 00:07:20.080 align:start position:0%
requirements laws passed at the end of
 
00:07:22.909 --> 00:07:22.919 align:start position:0%
of the 2023 legislative session
 
00:07:23.950 --> 00:07:23.960 align:start position:0%
transferred some of these
 
00:07:26.589 --> 00:07:26.599 align:start position:0%
responsibilities over to to the oplc and
 
00:07:28.790 --> 00:07:28.800 align:start position:0%
it could facilitate more streamline
 
00:07:30.749 --> 00:07:30.759 align:start position:0%
approach however some rules still need
 
00:07:33.790 --> 00:07:33.800 align:start position:0%
to be developed to implement these
 
00:07:36.150 --> 00:07:36.160 align:start position:0%
laws as shown in our recommendation
 
00:07:38.350 --> 00:07:38.360 align:start position:0%
summary starting on page three our
 
00:07:41.270 --> 00:07:41.280 align:start position:0%
report contains 12 observations with
 
00:07:43.830 --> 00:07:43.840 align:start position:0%
recommendations all five boards in oplc
 
00:07:46.029 --> 00:07:46.039 align:start position:0%
concurred with all 12 observations and
 
00:07:48.790 --> 00:07:48.800 align:start position:0%
six observations may require legislative
 
00:07:51.070 --> 00:07:51.080 align:start position:0%
attention as I go through the report
 
00:07:53.110 --> 00:07:53.120 align:start position:0%
I'll pause after each observation or set
 
00:07:54.790 --> 00:07:54.800 align:start position:0%
of observations to see if the committee
 
00:07:57.869 --> 00:07:57.879 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:00.270 --> 00:08:00.280 align:start position:0%
questions our back background starts on
 
00:08:02.670 --> 00:08:02.680 align:start position:0%
page 11 where we describe the types of
 
00:08:04.670 --> 00:08:04.680 align:start position:0%
Mental Health Professions licensed or
 
00:08:07.869 --> 00:08:07.879 align:start position:0%
certified in the state our table on page
 
00:08:10.189 --> 00:08:10.199 align:start position:0%

00:08:11.909 --> 00:08:11.919 align:start position:0%

00:08:20.029 --> 00:08:20.039 align:start position:0%
2022 so our first chapter on licensed
 
00:08:22.469 --> 00:08:22.479 align:start position:0%
portability starts on page
 
00:08:25.469 --> 00:08:25.479 align:start position:0%
15 portability is generally defined as
 
00:08:27.950 --> 00:08:27.960 align:start position:0%
the ability for individuals who are
 
00:08:29.629 --> 00:08:29.639 align:start position:0%
determined qualified to practice ice in
 
00:08:31.149 --> 00:08:31.159 align:start position:0%
one state to transfer their
 
00:08:33.430 --> 00:08:33.440 align:start position:0%
qualifications to another state
 
00:08:34.990 --> 00:08:35.000 align:start position:0%
nationally states have been reviewing

00:08:44.230 --> 00:08:44.240 align:start position:0%
issues our first observation starting on
 
00:08:46.630 --> 00:08:46.640 align:start position:0%
page 17 addresses the need to improve
 
00:08:49.470 --> 00:08:49.480 align:start position:0%
portability in New Hampshire during the
 
00:08:51.829 --> 00:08:51.839 align:start position:0%
audit period state laws required boards
 
00:08:54.269 --> 00:08:54.279 align:start position:0%
to facilitate license portability by
 
00:08:56.430 --> 00:08:56.440 align:start position:0%
identifying the states that have equal
 
00:08:58.590 --> 00:08:58.600 align:start position:0%
or substantially equivalent licensing
 
00:08:58.600 --> 00:08:59.829 align:start position:0%
or substantially equivalent licensing
requirements

00:08:59.829 --> 00:08:59.839 align:start position:0%
requirements
 
00:09:01.790 --> 00:09:01.800 align:start position:0%
it also required boards to publish a
 
00:09:03.630 --> 00:09:03.640 align:start position:0%
list of states with which New Hampshire
 
00:09:05.910 --> 00:09:05.920 align:start position:0%
had reciprocity agreements or had
 
00:09:08.630 --> 00:09:08.640 align:start position:0%
entered into multi-state compacts none
 
00:09:10.590 --> 00:09:10.600 align:start position:0%
of the boards had a process to identify
 
00:09:12.269 --> 00:09:12.279 align:start position:0%
the states that may have equal or
 
00:09:13.990 --> 00:09:14.000 align:start position:0%
substantially equivalent licensing
 
00:09:16.110 --> 00:09:16.120 align:start position:0%
requirements and no boards had entered
 
00:09:18.030 --> 00:09:18.040 align:start position:0%
into reciprocity
 
00:09:20.590 --> 00:09:20.600 align:start position:0%
agreements during our audit we reviewed
 
00:09:22.630 --> 00:09:22.640 align:start position:0%
basic licensing requirements for 15
 
00:09:24.150 --> 00:09:24.160 align:start position:0%
states and compared them to New
 
00:09:26.590 --> 00:09:26.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's as shown in the figures on

pages 19 through 23 we found New

Hampshire's requirements for many of the
 
00:09:33.990 --> 00:09:34.000 align:start position:0%
licenses we reviewed were generally
 
00:09:36.509 --> 00:09:36.519 align:start position:0%
comparable to other states for scope of
 
00:09:39.990 --> 00:09:40.000 align:start position:0%

license types that were a little harder
 
00:09:50.350 --> 00:09:50.360 align:start position:0%
to compare are found in appendix D at
 
00:09:51.910 --> 00:09:51.920 align:start position:0%
the end of the
 
00:09:54.310 --> 00:09:54.320 align:start position:0%
report we also found most boards
 
00:09:56.430 --> 00:09:56.440 align:start position:0%
required applicants applying through
 
00:09:58.550 --> 00:09:58.560 align:start position:0%
endorsement a process that should have
 
00:10:00.990 --> 00:10:01.000 align:start position:0%
facilitated reduced documentation and
 
00:10:03.389 --> 00:10:03.399 align:start position:0%
processing time to follow the same
 
00:10:05.110 --> 00:10:05.120 align:start position:0%
process as someone seeking a license for
 
00:10:06.069 --> 00:10:06.079 align:start position:0%
the first
 
00:10:08.350 --> 00:10:08.360 align:start position:0%
time laws that became effective at the
 
00:10:10.910 --> 00:10:10.920 align:start position:0%
end of August 2023 place the
 
00:10:13.230 --> 00:10:13.240 align:start position:0%
responsibility of determining what is
 
00:10:15.069 --> 00:10:15.079 align:start position:0%
considered substantially equivalent
 
00:10:17.230 --> 00:10:17.240 align:start position:0%
under the purview of the oplc executive
 
00:10:19.630 --> 00:10:19.640 align:start position:0%
director interim rules defining
 
00:10:21.269 --> 00:10:21.279 align:start position:0%
substantial equivalence have been
 
00:10:23.590 --> 00:10:23.600 align:start position:0%
developed for most of the professions um
 
00:10:25.350 --> 00:10:25.360 align:start position:0%
for most of these professions effective
 
00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:27.670 align:start position:0%
for most of these professions effective
October

00:10:27.670 --> 00:10:27.680 align:start position:0%
October
 
00:10:30.069 --> 00:10:30.079 align:start position:0%
2023 I'll pause here for any questions
 
00:10:36.069 --> 00:10:36.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:39.509 --> 00:10:39.519 align:start position:0%
one earlier in the presentation you said
 
00:10:42.870 --> 00:10:42.880 align:start position:0%
that some of the responsibility of the
 
00:10:45.990 --> 00:10:46.000 align:start position:0%
um licensing had been transferred to
 
00:10:48.430 --> 00:10:48.440 align:start position:0%
oplc how much time do you think you
 
00:10:50.430 --> 00:10:50.440 align:start position:0%
would take for that kind of change of
 
00:10:52.590 --> 00:10:52.600 align:start position:0%
procedure to know whether or not it's
 
00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:53.750 align:start position:0%
procedure to know whether or not it's
been

00:10:53.750 --> 00:10:53.760 align:start position:0%
been
 
00:10:57.230 --> 00:10:57.240 align:start position:0%
effective that's hard to to answer um
 
00:10:59.990 --> 00:11:00.000 align:start position:0%
basically the laws became effective at
 
00:11:03.590 --> 00:11:03.600 align:start position:0%
the end of the last um session so I
 
00:11:05.030 --> 00:11:05.040 align:start position:0%
would imagine that they would still need
 
00:11:07.550 --> 00:11:07.560 align:start position:0%
to develop some interim rules which um
 
00:11:10.350 --> 00:11:10.360 align:start position:0%
they have some interim rules now they
 
00:11:12.350 --> 00:11:12.360 align:start position:0%
would have to go through a process to
 
00:11:14.389 --> 00:11:14.399 align:start position:0%
get those rules uh made into regular
 
00:11:16.430 --> 00:11:16.440 align:start position:0%
rules and then there's going to be a
 
00:11:17.629 --> 00:11:17.639 align:start position:0%
process where it's going to be a little
 
00:11:20.829 --> 00:11:20.839 align:start position:0%
bumpy at first uh for oplc to implement
 
00:11:23.590 --> 00:11:23.600 align:start position:0%
yes some of these procedures um the
 
00:11:26.230 --> 00:11:26.240 align:start position:0%
outline of the re reciprocity rule has
 
00:11:28.310 --> 00:11:28.320 align:start position:0%
been approved but not all professions
 
00:11:31.790 --> 00:11:31.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:33.629 --> 00:11:33.639 align:start position:0%
oh it's hard to answer that question I
 
00:11:36.829 --> 00:11:36.839 align:start position:0%
think thank you you're
 
00:11:36.839 --> 00:11:38.350 align:start position:0%
think thank you you're
welcome

00:11:38.350 --> 00:11:38.360 align:start position:0%
welcome
 
00:11:41.670 --> 00:11:41.680 align:start position:0%
okay um observation number two starting
 
00:11:45.470 --> 00:11:45.480 align:start position:0%
on page 27 addresses expedited lure
 
00:11:47.790 --> 00:11:47.800 align:start position:0%
state laws required boards to identify
 
00:11:49.629 --> 00:11:49.639 align:start position:0%
the states with which they have
 
00:11:51.990 --> 00:11:52.000 align:start position:0%
established criteria for Lure by
 
00:11:54.629 --> 00:11:54.639 align:start position:0%
endorsement endorsement is an expedited
 
00:11:56.350 --> 00:11:56.360 align:start position:0%
process where States consider the
 
00:11:58.990 --> 00:11:59.000 align:start position:0%
qualifications of of an applicant who
 
00:12:00.990 --> 00:12:01.000 align:start position:0%
already holds a license in another state
 
00:12:02.350 --> 00:12:02.360 align:start position:0%
to determine whether those
 
00:12:04.190 --> 00:12:04.200 align:start position:0%
qualifications can be considered
 
00:12:06.990 --> 00:12:07.000 align:start position:0%
substantially equivalent to their own
 
00:12:09.269 --> 00:12:09.279 align:start position:0%
board processes intended to expedite
 
00:12:11.110 --> 00:12:11.120 align:start position:0%
licensing for individuals already
 
00:12:13.069 --> 00:12:13.079 align:start position:0%
practicing in another state did not
 
00:12:14.790 --> 00:12:14.800 align:start position:0%
significantly reduce the amount of time
 
00:12:17.430 --> 00:12:17.440 align:start position:0%
for them to obtain a license for some
 
00:12:19.150 --> 00:12:19.160 align:start position:0%
professions applicants were still
 
00:12:20.949 --> 00:12:20.959 align:start position:0%
required to provide most of the same
 
00:12:22.590 --> 00:12:22.600 align:start position:0%
documents as someone who had never been
 
00:12:25.110 --> 00:12:25.120 align:start position:0%
licensed before and most boards still
 
00:12:26.949 --> 00:12:26.959 align:start position:0%
require these applicants to be reviewed
 
00:12:30.189 --> 00:12:30.199 align:start position:0%
on a case-by Case basis
 
00:12:33.150 --> 00:12:33.160 align:start position:0%
any questions on observation two for
 
00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:35.310 align:start position:0%
any questions on observation two for
exped

00:12:35.310 --> 00:12:35.320 align:start position:0%
exped
 
00:12:38.150 --> 00:12:38.160 align:start position:0%
lure just that I'm very disappointed
 
00:12:42.590 --> 00:12:42.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:45.629 --> 00:12:45.639 align:start position:0%
case right
 
00:12:47.629 --> 00:12:47.639 align:start position:0%
representative just need to get back to
 
00:12:50.069 --> 00:12:50.079 align:start position:0%
the beginning but was that one that um
 
00:12:51.870 --> 00:12:51.880 align:start position:0%
sugest were you suggested any
 
00:12:55.430 --> 00:12:55.440 align:start position:0%
legislative changes or um I have not uh
 
00:12:57.069 --> 00:12:57.079 align:start position:0%
gotten to any of the observations that
 
00:12:59.150 --> 00:12:59.160 align:start position:0%
require legislative changes yet I guess
 
00:13:00.870 --> 00:13:00.880 align:start position:0%
the question then is what what would
 
00:13:04.269 --> 00:13:04.279 align:start position:0%
need to change there to U fix that
 
00:13:07.189 --> 00:13:07.199 align:start position:0%
problem and uh you know would the
 
00:13:08.790 --> 00:13:08.800 align:start position:0%
legislature need to be involved at all
 
00:13:10.750 --> 00:13:10.760 align:start position:0%
in that uh are you referring to
 
00:13:13.870 --> 00:13:13.880 align:start position:0%
observations number one and two two um
 
00:13:16.470 --> 00:13:16.480 align:start position:0%
so the process see state laws ALS
 
00:13:19.150 --> 00:13:19.160 align:start position:0%
already require most boards to have an
 
00:13:21.550 --> 00:13:21.560 align:start position:0%
expedit process it's how they Implement
 
00:13:23.829 --> 00:13:23.839 align:start position:0%
those expedit processes that seem to be
 
00:13:27.150 --> 00:13:27.160 align:start position:0%
a hindrance to um faster processing time
 
00:13:28.990 --> 00:13:29.000 align:start position:0%
so as I said there are some documents
 
00:13:31.710 --> 00:13:31.720 align:start position:0%
ation requirements that boards require
 
00:13:35.310 --> 00:13:35.320 align:start position:0%
documents that boards require that may
 
00:13:37.910 --> 00:13:37.920 align:start position:0%
not necessarily need to be reverified if
 
00:13:39.470 --> 00:13:39.480 align:start position:0%
the person's already been licensed and
 
00:13:41.710 --> 00:13:41.720 align:start position:0%
verified in another state for example
 
00:13:44.350 --> 00:13:44.360 align:start position:0%
education requirements for social
 
00:13:47.150 --> 00:13:47.160 align:start position:0%
work um social work is one of the social
 
00:13:49.189 --> 00:13:49.199 align:start position:0%
workers are one of the professions
 
00:13:51.509 --> 00:13:51.519 align:start position:0%
that's very well standardized throughout
 
00:13:53.509 --> 00:13:53.519 align:start position:0%
the whole country so the requirements
 
00:13:55.629 --> 00:13:55.639 align:start position:0%
there are a master's degree if another
 
00:13:57.189 --> 00:13:57.199 align:start position:0%
state has already verified that I have a
 
00:13:58.790 --> 00:13:58.800 align:start position:0%
master's degree in social work does new
 
00:14:01.430 --> 00:14:01.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire need to reverifying them to
 
00:14:02.829 --> 00:14:02.839 align:start position:0%
look I understand and agree followup
 
00:14:04.910 --> 00:14:04.920 align:start position:0%
sorry follow up please um so what I'm
 
00:14:07.590 --> 00:14:07.600 align:start position:0%
trying to get at is the board apparently
 
00:14:09.269 --> 00:14:09.279 align:start position:0%
in this regard isn't doing what they're
 
00:14:11.829 --> 00:14:11.839 align:start position:0%
supposed to do and the question is you
 
00:14:13.790 --> 00:14:13.800 align:start position:0%
know what can be done to get them to do
 
00:14:16.269 --> 00:14:16.279 align:start position:0%
it if not if you're not recommending
 
00:14:18.550 --> 00:14:18.560 align:start position:0%
legislation you know do you have some
 
00:14:20.389 --> 00:14:20.399 align:start position:0%
reason to believe this might improve and
 
00:14:23.590 --> 00:14:23.600 align:start position:0%
if so some of the legislation has
 
00:14:25.590 --> 00:14:25.600 align:start position:0%
already been made that could help
 
00:14:29.110 --> 00:14:29.120 align:start position:0%
address this particular issue um as I
 
00:14:30.749 --> 00:14:30.759 align:start position:0%
said in observation number one some of
 
00:14:33.269 --> 00:14:33.279 align:start position:0%
these uh processes have been transferred
 
00:14:36.350 --> 00:14:36.360 align:start position:0%
to oplc and Licensing is one of them so
 
00:14:38.350 --> 00:14:38.360 align:start position:0%
the ability to approve or deny a license
 
00:14:40.389 --> 00:14:40.399 align:start position:0%
has been transferred to oplc so as far
 
00:14:42.629 --> 00:14:42.639 align:start position:0%
as the expedit process it would be up to
 
00:14:45.389 --> 00:14:45.399 align:start position:0%
oplc to streamline those expedited
 
00:14:48.030 --> 00:14:48.040 align:start position:0%
processes to make it easier and to make
 
00:14:52.189 --> 00:14:52.199 align:start position:0%
it um a little bit uh document less
 
00:14:54.550 --> 00:14:54.560 align:start position:0%
documentation requirements okay thank
 
00:14:56.749 --> 00:14:56.759 align:start position:0%
you that answers it you're welcome I
 
00:14:59.230 --> 00:14:59.240 align:start position:0%
have a question represent ver um you
 
00:15:01.030 --> 00:15:01.040 align:start position:0%
touched a little bit about this are
 
00:15:02.629 --> 00:15:02.639 align:start position:0%
there any federal
 
00:15:05.629 --> 00:15:05.639 align:start position:0%
reciprocity um regulations that could
 
00:15:08.749 --> 00:15:08.759 align:start position:0%
apply that could help us especially in
 
00:15:12.430 --> 00:15:12.440 align:start position:0%
the medical field I'm not well-versed in
 
00:15:14.069 --> 00:15:14.079 align:start position:0%
any of the federal reciprocity
 
00:15:16.230 --> 00:15:16.240 align:start position:0%
requirements I would need to do a lot
 
00:15:18.990 --> 00:15:19.000 align:start position:0%
more research on that that's okay thank
 
00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.509 align:start position:0%
more research on that that's okay thank
you

00:15:21.509 --> 00:15:21.519 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:15:24.870 --> 00:15:24.880 align:start position:0%
okay um so observation number three
 
00:15:26.949 --> 00:15:26.959 align:start position:0%
which may require legislative action
 
00:15:29.269 --> 00:15:29.279 align:start position:0%
starts on page 32 and addresses
 
00:15:32.350 --> 00:15:32.360 align:start position:0%
temporary lure board laws allowing
 
00:15:34.470 --> 00:15:34.480 align:start position:0%
individuals already licensed in another
 
00:15:36.350 --> 00:15:36.360 align:start position:0%
state to practice temporarily while
 
00:15:37.829 --> 00:15:37.839 align:start position:0%
their application was pending in New
 
00:15:39.949 --> 00:15:39.959 align:start position:0%
Hampshire were not aligned with more
 
00:15:42.749 --> 00:15:42.759 align:start position:0%
recent overarching state law the process
 
00:15:44.629 --> 00:15:44.639 align:start position:0%
also appeared to be underutilized during
 
00:15:47.590 --> 00:15:47.600 align:start position:0%
the audit period overarching state laws
 
00:15:50.710 --> 00:15:50.720 align:start position:0%
passed in 2020 establish specific
 
00:15:52.470 --> 00:15:52.480 align:start position:0%
criteria for obtaining a temporary
 
00:15:55.110 --> 00:15:55.120 align:start position:0%
license however some boards laws and
 
00:15:57.269 --> 00:15:57.279 align:start position:0%
rules imposed other
 
00:15:59.230 --> 00:15:59.240 align:start position:0%
requirements addition Al while
 
00:16:01.189 --> 00:16:01.199 align:start position:0%
overarching state laws allow temporary
 
00:16:04.430 --> 00:16:04.440 align:start position:0%
licenses to be valid for up to 120 days
 
00:16:06.189 --> 00:16:06.199 align:start position:0%
time frames in board's laws and rules
 
00:16:08.350 --> 00:16:08.360 align:start position:0%
allowed them to be valid from between 30
 
00:16:10.509 --> 00:16:10.519 align:start position:0%
days and 180
 
00:16:13.590 --> 00:16:13.600 align:start position:0%
days finally while oplc rules and
 
00:16:16.110 --> 00:16:16.120 align:start position:0%
board's laws required individuals hold
 
00:16:17.590 --> 00:16:17.600 align:start position:0%
the license in a state with
 
00:16:19.389 --> 00:16:19.399 align:start position:0%
substantially equivalent licensing
 
00:16:21.430 --> 00:16:21.440 align:start position:0%
requirements before being issued a
 
00:16:23.910 --> 00:16:23.920 align:start position:0%
temporary license overarching state law
 
00:16:26.150 --> 00:16:26.160 align:start position:0%
did not this conflict may require
 
00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:27.509 align:start position:0%
did not this conflict may require
legislative

00:16:27.509 --> 00:16:27.519 align:start position:0%
legislative
 
00:16:27.519 --> 00:16:29.670 align:start position:0%
legislative
clarification

00:16:29.670 --> 00:16:29.680 align:start position:0%
clarification
 
00:16:31.550 --> 00:16:31.560 align:start position:0%
there any questions on that one before
 
00:16:31.560 --> 00:16:35.309 align:start position:0%
there any questions on that one before
we

00:16:35.309 --> 00:16:35.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:35.319 --> 00:16:37.309 align:start position:0%
 
proceed

00:16:37.309 --> 00:16:37.319 align:start position:0%
proceed
 
00:16:40.230 --> 00:16:40.240 align:start position:0%
okay observation four which may also
 
00:16:42.350 --> 00:16:42.360 align:start position:0%
require legislative action starts on
 
00:16:45.670 --> 00:16:45.680 align:start position:0%
page 36 and addresses applications from
 
00:16:48.269 --> 00:16:48.279 align:start position:0%
military members and their spouses state
 
00:16:50.790 --> 00:16:50.800 align:start position:0%
law required boards to develop processes
 
00:16:52.949 --> 00:16:52.959 align:start position:0%
to facilitate portability for members of
 
00:16:55.269 --> 00:16:55.279 align:start position:0%
the military and Military spouses who
 
00:16:57.829 --> 00:16:57.839 align:start position:0%
already held a license in another state
 
00:17:00.350 --> 00:17:00.360 align:start position:0%
however no board s have developed these
 
00:17:02.790 --> 00:17:02.800 align:start position:0%
processes state law and rules also
 
00:17:05.110 --> 00:17:05.120 align:start position:0%
required the oplc to issue a temporary
 
00:17:07.350 --> 00:17:07.360 align:start position:0%
license to military Affiliated
 
00:17:09.230 --> 00:17:09.240 align:start position:0%
applicants who already held an active
 
00:17:11.750 --> 00:17:11.760 align:start position:0%
license in another state it could allow
 
00:17:13.470 --> 00:17:13.480 align:start position:0%
them to practice temporarily for up to
 
00:17:16.470 --> 00:17:16.480 align:start position:0%
one year however overarching state law
 
00:17:18.949 --> 00:17:18.959 align:start position:0%
addressing temporary lure in general and
 
00:17:20.510 --> 00:17:20.520 align:start position:0%
the more specific law addressing
 
00:17:23.350 --> 00:17:23.360 align:start position:0%
temporary lure for military Affiliated
 
00:17:26.110 --> 00:17:26.120 align:start position:0%
Affiliated applicants conflicted about
 
00:17:27.710 --> 00:17:27.720 align:start position:0%
whether the applicant had to hold a
 
00:17:29.630 --> 00:17:29.640 align:start position:0%
license in a state with similar
 
00:17:31.669 --> 00:17:31.679 align:start position:0%
licensing requirements before obtaining
 
00:17:34.150 --> 00:17:34.160 align:start position:0%
a temporary license this conflict may
 
00:17:35.710 --> 00:17:35.720 align:start position:0%
require legislative
 
00:17:40.070 --> 00:17:40.080 align:start position:0%
attention so what what I get from that
 
00:17:42.310 --> 00:17:42.320 align:start position:0%
finding is that we have multiple laws
 
00:17:44.630 --> 00:17:44.640 align:start position:0%
addressing the same issues and they
 
00:17:46.310 --> 00:17:46.320 align:start position:0%
don't always agree with each other
 
00:17:46.320 --> 00:17:47.310 align:start position:0%
don't always agree with each other
that's

00:17:47.310 --> 00:17:47.320 align:start position:0%
that's
 
00:17:49.950 --> 00:17:49.960 align:start position:0%
correct I was afraid of that thank you I
 
00:17:52.110 --> 00:17:52.120 align:start position:0%
think there are some other areas too
 
00:17:53.789 --> 00:17:53.799 align:start position:0%
where there are some conflicts and I'll
 
00:17:55.669 --> 00:17:55.679 align:start position:0%
go through those as well all right thank
 
00:17:57.390 --> 00:17:57.400 align:start position:0%
you any other
 
00:17:57.400 --> 00:17:58.909 align:start position:0%
you any other
questions

00:17:58.909 --> 00:17:58.919 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:17:58.919 --> 00:18:00.029 align:start position:0%
questions
all

00:18:00.029 --> 00:18:00.039 align:start position:0%
all
 
00:18:03.669 --> 00:18:03.679 align:start position:0%
right our next chapter on initial
 
00:18:06.470 --> 00:18:06.480 align:start position:0%
licensing initial application processing
 
00:18:08.549 --> 00:18:08.559 align:start position:0%
starts on page
 
00:18:11.750 --> 00:18:11.760 align:start position:0%
41 observations five and six starting on
 
00:18:13.750 --> 00:18:13.760 align:start position:0%
page 41 address timeliness of
 
00:18:16.669 --> 00:18:16.679 align:start position:0%
application processing observation Five
 
00:18:20.149 --> 00:18:20.159 align:start position:0%
May uh may require legislative action
 
00:18:22.350 --> 00:18:22.360 align:start position:0%
state laws required boards to complete
 
00:18:24.070 --> 00:18:24.080 align:start position:0%
certain aspects of the application
 
00:18:26.669 --> 00:18:26.679 align:start position:0%
process within specified time limits
 
00:18:28.390 --> 00:18:28.400 align:start position:0%
however we found time limits in three
 
00:18:30.070 --> 00:18:30.080 align:start position:0%
board's rules during the audit period
 
00:18:32.110 --> 00:18:32.120 align:start position:0%
did not align with corresponding state
 
00:18:34.909 --> 00:18:34.919 align:start position:0%
laws by the end of the audit two of the
 
00:18:36.750 --> 00:18:36.760 align:start position:0%
three boards had filed rules to align
 
00:18:38.230 --> 00:18:38.240 align:start position:0%
their time limits with corresponding
 
00:18:40.590 --> 00:18:40.600 align:start position:0%
laws we also found one board was
 
00:18:42.510 --> 00:18:42.520 align:start position:0%
statutorily allowed half the time of
 
00:18:44.630 --> 00:18:44.640 align:start position:0%
other boards to process applications and
 
00:18:46.870 --> 00:18:46.880 align:start position:0%
we questioned the efficiency of tracking
 
00:18:50.110 --> 00:18:50.120 align:start position:0%
different time limits for similar
 
00:18:52.549 --> 00:18:52.559 align:start position:0%
processes while we found boards met
 
00:18:54.270 --> 00:18:54.280 align:start position:0%
processing timelines established in
 
00:18:56.830 --> 00:18:56.840 align:start position:0%
statute most of the time they could not
 
00:18:58.350 --> 00:18:58.360 align:start position:0%
actually monitor whether they were
 
00:19:00.110 --> 00:19:00.120 align:start position:0%
meeting them because the licensing
 
00:19:02.110 --> 00:19:02.120 align:start position:0%
system did not collect dates associated
 
00:19:04.110 --> 00:19:04.120 align:start position:0%
with Key activities that would have been
 
00:19:05.990 --> 00:19:06.000 align:start position:0%
necessary to monitor
 
00:19:08.230 --> 00:19:08.240 align:start position:0%
compliance nor was there a process to
 
00:19:10.789 --> 00:19:10.799 align:start position:0%
manually manually collect these dates to
 
00:19:14.070 --> 00:19:14.080 align:start position:0%
ensure that they were timely any
 
00:19:17.270 --> 00:19:17.280 align:start position:0%
questions thank you so at this time when
 
00:19:19.590 --> 00:19:19.600 align:start position:0%
when this audit was being conducted was
 
00:19:21.630 --> 00:19:21.640 align:start position:0%
the applications for licensing still
 
00:19:25.549 --> 00:19:25.559 align:start position:0%
being done by paper yes followup
 
00:19:28.870 --> 00:19:28.880 align:start position:0%
followup so there is supposedly a new
 
00:19:30.710 --> 00:19:30.720 align:start position:0%
portal system now that's going to be
 
00:19:33.549 --> 00:19:33.559 align:start position:0%
implemented by oplc more like a general
 
00:19:36.909 --> 00:19:36.919 align:start position:0%
Administration function and that I would
 
00:19:39.950 --> 00:19:39.960 align:start position:0%
think might be would when you say it
 
00:19:41.789 --> 00:19:41.799 align:start position:0%
needs further legislation we've already
 
00:19:44.789 --> 00:19:44.799 align:start position:0%
passed that legislation right so that's
 
00:19:47.510 --> 00:19:47.520 align:start position:0%
my question earlier do we wait like a
 
00:19:49.190 --> 00:19:49.200 align:start position:0%
couple of years before we see how
 
00:19:50.950 --> 00:19:50.960 align:start position:0%
effective this is or do we wait three
 
00:19:52.630 --> 00:19:52.640 align:start position:0%
years you know I I know we not going to
 
00:19:54.669 --> 00:19:54.679 align:start position:0%
have an answer in six months or a year
 
00:19:57.270 --> 00:19:57.280 align:start position:0%
right that that's correct so at the end
 
00:20:00.549 --> 00:20:00.559 align:start position:0%
of the audit they uh oplc was discussing
 
00:20:02.230 --> 00:20:02.240 align:start position:0%
uh transitioning to a new licensing
 
00:20:05.190 --> 00:20:05.200 align:start position:0%
portal and um from their discussion
 
00:20:07.470 --> 00:20:07.480 align:start position:0%
there would be those uh a portal where
 
00:20:09.430 --> 00:20:09.440 align:start position:0%
somebody could log in enter all their
 
00:20:11.310 --> 00:20:11.320 align:start position:0%
information and it there it would be
 
00:20:13.190 --> 00:20:13.200 align:start position:0%
filling out their application online
 
00:20:16.149 --> 00:20:16.159 align:start position:0%
rather than printing it out and um
 
00:20:19.470 --> 00:20:19.480 align:start position:0%
handing it in VIA mail um I'm not
 
00:20:21.830 --> 00:20:21.840 align:start position:0%
exactly sure how far along that process
 
00:20:24.110 --> 00:20:24.120 align:start position:0%
is at this point I know that uh at the
 
00:20:25.549 --> 00:20:25.559 align:start position:0%
end of the audit they were still
 
00:20:29.870 --> 00:20:29.880 align:start position:0%
discussing it oh thank you um because I
 
00:20:32.630 --> 00:20:32.640 align:start position:0%
think one of the delays in the licensing
 
00:20:34.750 --> 00:20:34.760 align:start position:0%
maybe you can confirm that the licensing
 
00:20:36.950 --> 00:20:36.960 align:start position:0%
application is that an applicant will
 
00:20:38.750 --> 00:20:38.760 align:start position:0%
send in their information but it's not
 
00:20:41.350 --> 00:20:41.360 align:start position:0%
completed which forces oplc to send it
 
00:20:43.789 --> 00:20:43.799 align:start position:0%
back and then you know this back and
 
00:20:47.830 --> 00:20:47.840 align:start position:0%
forth in the mail thing happens and that
 
00:20:53.430 --> 00:20:53.440 align:start position:0%
is a an issue for both parties right yes
 
00:20:55.270 --> 00:20:55.280 align:start position:0%
uh yeah so when we were going through
 
00:20:57.470 --> 00:20:57.480 align:start position:0%
the audit that that is the process that
 
00:20:59.190 --> 00:20:59.200 align:start position:0%
uh was explained to us and that we could
 
00:21:01.029 --> 00:21:01.039 align:start position:0%
we could see also through the files that
 
00:21:03.750 --> 00:21:03.760 align:start position:0%
we were reviewing so somebody could send
 
00:21:06.230 --> 00:21:06.240 align:start position:0%
in an application it could let's say
 
00:21:08.270 --> 00:21:08.280 align:start position:0%
they were missing certain pieces oplc
 
00:21:11.950 --> 00:21:11.960 align:start position:0%
had 30 days to identify what was missing
 
00:21:13.470 --> 00:21:13.480 align:start position:0%
and then tell the applicant that they
 
00:21:14.789 --> 00:21:14.799 align:start position:0%
were missing these
 
00:21:17.269 --> 00:21:17.279 align:start position:0%
documents and then at that point oplc
 
00:21:18.510 --> 00:21:18.520 align:start position:0%
and the boards were waiting on the
 
00:21:20.390 --> 00:21:20.400 align:start position:0%
applicant to submit that information
 
00:21:23.110 --> 00:21:23.120 align:start position:0%
back so there there are inefficiencies
 
00:21:25.669 --> 00:21:25.679 align:start position:0%
in that respect from my understanding
 
00:21:28.710 --> 00:21:28.720 align:start position:0%
the uh licensing um system that they
 
00:21:31.029 --> 00:21:31.039 align:start position:0%
were going to transition to would kind
 
00:21:33.950 --> 00:21:33.960 align:start position:0%
of eliminate that or at least reduce it
 
00:21:36.070 --> 00:21:36.080 align:start position:0%
where an applicant an application would
 
00:21:39.029 --> 00:21:39.039 align:start position:0%
not be submitted to oplc until all of
 
00:21:43.190 --> 00:21:43.200 align:start position:0%
the pieces were complete so that's my
 
00:21:44.590 --> 00:21:44.600 align:start position:0%
understanding thank
 
00:21:48.390 --> 00:21:48.400 align:start position:0%
you oh okay good yes and there's also
 
00:21:51.350 --> 00:21:51.360 align:start position:0%
the issue that even if the applicants
 
00:21:53.269 --> 00:21:53.279 align:start position:0%
done everything necessary the criminal
 
00:21:55.669 --> 00:21:55.679 align:start position:0%
background check might not be ready
 
00:21:57.549 --> 00:21:57.559 align:start position:0%
that's correct and that's usually one of
 
00:22:00.669 --> 00:22:00.679 align:start position:0%
the last pieces es that um the oplc and
 
00:22:01.830 --> 00:22:01.840 align:start position:0%
the boards are waiting for because
 
00:22:03.510 --> 00:22:03.520 align:start position:0%
they're they're waiting on State Police
 
00:22:05.110 --> 00:22:05.120 align:start position:0%
at that point
 
00:22:09.549 --> 00:22:09.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:12.950 --> 00:22:12.960 align:start position:0%
Pro observations seven and eight both of
 
00:22:14.669 --> 00:22:14.679 align:start position:0%
which may require legislative action
 
00:22:18.029 --> 00:22:18.039 align:start position:0%
start on page 51 and address developing
 
00:22:19.830 --> 00:22:19.840 align:start position:0%
or expanding a tiered approach to
 
00:22:22.470 --> 00:22:22.480 align:start position:0%
approving license applications a tiered
 
00:22:24.549 --> 00:22:24.559 align:start position:0%
approach including approvals at levels
 
00:22:26.510 --> 00:22:26.520 align:start position:0%
below the full board could have reduced
 
00:22:28.430 --> 00:22:28.440 align:start position:0%
approval time for some application s
 
00:22:30.990 --> 00:22:31.000 align:start position:0%
presenting low licensing risk allowing
 
00:22:33.549 --> 00:22:33.559 align:start position:0%
these applicants to practice sooner two
 
00:22:35.750 --> 00:22:35.760 align:start position:0%
boards required all applications be
 
00:22:37.830 --> 00:22:37.840 align:start position:0%
reviewed at a monthly board meeting even
 
00:22:40.549 --> 00:22:40.559 align:start position:0%
those that posed lower risk one board
 
00:22:42.549 --> 00:22:42.559 align:start position:0%
allowed oplc staff to approve some
 
00:22:45.110 --> 00:22:45.120 align:start position:0%
applications and issue licenses however
 
00:22:47.149 --> 00:22:47.159 align:start position:0%
other types of lower risk applications
 
00:22:48.789 --> 00:22:48.799 align:start position:0%
could have potentially been approved
 
00:22:50.789 --> 00:22:50.799 align:start position:0%
without full Board review reducing that
 
00:22:55.029 --> 00:22:55.039 align:start position:0%
time further in July 2023 the oplc
 
00:22:57.070 --> 00:22:57.080 align:start position:0%
became responsible for approving or
 
00:22:58.830 --> 00:22:58.840 align:start position:0%
denying license applications
 
00:23:01.070 --> 00:23:01.080 align:start position:0%
facilitating this tiered approach
 
00:23:03.390 --> 00:23:03.400 align:start position:0%
board's laws may need to be reviewed to
 
00:23:05.190 --> 00:23:05.200 align:start position:0%
remove some negated language given the
 
00:23:07.510 --> 00:23:07.520 align:start position:0%
opl's authority over this
 
00:23:11.909 --> 00:23:11.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:14.510 --> 00:23:14.520 align:start position:0%
questions blackis this one actually goes
 
00:23:16.430 --> 00:23:16.440 align:start position:0%
back to the prior to um just a
 
00:23:16.440 --> 00:23:18.070 align:start position:0%
back to the prior to um just a
clarification

00:23:18.070 --> 00:23:18.080 align:start position:0%
clarification
 
00:23:22.070 --> 00:23:22.080 align:start position:0%
so do do you know I mean you recommend a
 
00:23:25.310 --> 00:23:25.320 align:start position:0%
possible legislative action um do you
 
00:23:26.909 --> 00:23:26.919 align:start position:0%
know or at least have a feeling as to
 
00:23:29.510 --> 00:23:29.520 align:start position:0%
whether the legislation that took place
 
00:23:29.520 --> 00:23:30.390 align:start position:0%
whether the legislation that took place
last

00:23:30.390 --> 00:23:30.400 align:start position:0%
last
 
00:23:33.310 --> 00:23:33.320 align:start position:0%
year um would meet that or do you have
 
00:23:35.510 --> 00:23:35.520 align:start position:0%
specific additional legislative action
 
00:23:37.230 --> 00:23:37.240 align:start position:0%
you believe would be needed and I
 
00:23:39.029 --> 00:23:39.039 align:start position:0%
suppose that could apply to to this one
 
00:23:42.590 --> 00:23:42.600 align:start position:0%
as well yes so um in this observation in
 
00:23:44.710 --> 00:23:44.720 align:start position:0%
particular uh 7 and8 we do we do
 
00:23:47.070 --> 00:23:47.080 align:start position:0%
recognize that that licensing Authority
 
00:23:48.510 --> 00:23:48.520 align:start position:0%
the authority to approve or deny
 
00:23:50.750 --> 00:23:50.760 align:start position:0%
applications which the boards held
 
00:23:52.390 --> 00:23:52.400 align:start position:0%
before is now being transferred has now
 
00:23:55.990 --> 00:23:56.000 align:start position:0%
been transferred to oplc so it should
 
00:23:58.510 --> 00:23:58.520 align:start position:0%
address some of the expedited license uh
 
00:24:00.390 --> 00:24:00.400 align:start position:0%
process that you asked me about earlier
 
00:24:02.149 --> 00:24:02.159 align:start position:0%
so the oplc is now responsible for that
 
00:24:04.630 --> 00:24:04.640 align:start position:0%
so they'll craft a process around that
 
00:24:07.470 --> 00:24:07.480 align:start position:0%
to hopefully make it faster uh for this
 
00:24:10.350 --> 00:24:10.360 align:start position:0%
one um legislation has already been
 
00:24:12.950 --> 00:24:12.960 align:start position:0%
implemented has already passed to
 
00:24:15.990 --> 00:24:16.000 align:start position:0%
transfer uh that authority to oplc so as
 
00:24:18.510 --> 00:24:18.520 align:start position:0%
far as we're concerned that piece
 
00:24:22.070 --> 00:24:22.080 align:start position:0%
addresses the core of our observation
 
00:24:23.750 --> 00:24:23.760 align:start position:0%
the rest of the legislative changes that
 
00:24:27.070 --> 00:24:27.080 align:start position:0%
need to be made in this um observation
 
00:24:28.230 --> 00:24:28.240 align:start position:0%
go back to what we're representative
 
00:24:29.990 --> 00:24:30.000 align:start position:0%
McGuire was asking clean up of the
 
00:24:31.590 --> 00:24:31.600 align:start position:0%
language where there is still
 
00:24:33.630 --> 00:24:33.640 align:start position:0%
conflicting language on who has the
 
00:24:35.350 --> 00:24:35.360 align:start position:0%
authority so that's where we're
 
00:24:37.070 --> 00:24:37.080 align:start position:0%
recommending additional changes to
 
00:24:44.750 --> 00:24:44.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:47.430 --> 00:24:47.440 align:start position:0%
welcome observation nine starting on
 
00:24:50.470 --> 00:24:50.480 align:start position:0%
page 61 addresses board practices for
 
00:24:52.510 --> 00:24:52.520 align:start position:0%
reviewing applicants criminal
 
00:24:55.029 --> 00:24:55.039 align:start position:0%
convictions state law allowed boards to
 
00:24:57.190 --> 00:24:57.200 align:start position:0%
disqualify applicants for convictions
 
00:24:59.430 --> 00:24:59.440 align:start position:0%
that have a substantial or direct
 
00:25:02.190 --> 00:25:02.200 align:start position:0%
relationship to their profession and if
 
00:25:04.430 --> 00:25:04.440 align:start position:0%
disqualifying the applicant protected
 
00:25:07.149 --> 00:25:07.159 align:start position:0%
Public Safety however boards did not
 
00:25:08.789 --> 00:25:08.799 align:start position:0%
identify which convictions were
 
00:25:10.510 --> 00:25:10.520 align:start position:0%
substantially or directly related to
 
00:25:12.470 --> 00:25:12.480 align:start position:0%
their profession and three boards
 
00:25:14.590 --> 00:25:14.600 align:start position:0%
required applicants disclose criminal
 
00:25:17.430 --> 00:25:17.440 align:start position:0%
charges even if they did not result in a
 
00:25:19.990 --> 00:25:20.000 align:start position:0%
conviction laws also allowed boards to
 
00:25:21.710 --> 00:25:21.720 align:start position:0%
consider the time passed since the
 
00:25:23.389 --> 00:25:23.399 align:start position:0%
conviction but none of the board's laws
 
00:25:25.510 --> 00:25:25.520 align:start position:0%
or rules considered this and applicants
 
00:25:27.070 --> 00:25:27.080 align:start position:0%
were required to disclose all
 
00:25:29.149 --> 00:25:29.159 align:start position:0%
convictions regardless of how long ago
 
00:25:29.159 --> 00:25:30.110 align:start position:0%
convictions regardless of how long ago
they

00:25:30.110 --> 00:25:30.120 align:start position:0%
they
 
00:25:32.870 --> 00:25:32.880 align:start position:0%
occurred state laws also allowed anyone
 
00:25:34.789 --> 00:25:34.799 align:start position:0%
to petition a board to determine whether
 
00:25:36.549 --> 00:25:36.559 align:start position:0%
their criminal record would disqualify
 
00:25:39.110 --> 00:25:39.120 align:start position:0%
them from a license or certification it
 
00:25:41.590 --> 00:25:41.600 align:start position:0%
also required the oplc to track and
 
00:25:43.590 --> 00:25:43.600 align:start position:0%
annually report information on these
 
00:25:45.789 --> 00:25:45.799 align:start position:0%
petitions however the process was not
 
00:25:48.310 --> 00:25:48.320 align:start position:0%
outlined in any of the board's uh
 
00:25:51.350 --> 00:25:51.360 align:start position:0%
websites or opl's websites and oplc did
 
00:25:53.070 --> 00:25:53.080 align:start position:0%
not provide any annual reporting on
 
00:25:53.080 --> 00:25:54.510 align:start position:0%
not provide any annual reporting on
these

00:25:54.510 --> 00:25:54.520 align:start position:0%
these
 
00:25:57.269 --> 00:25:57.279 align:start position:0%
petitions any questions on observation
 
00:25:59.510 --> 00:25:59.520 align:start position:0%
number nine
 
00:26:00.870 --> 00:26:00.880 align:start position:0%
actually this might be a question that
 
00:26:04.070 --> 00:26:04.080 align:start position:0%
you could help with and that is um on
 
00:26:07.070 --> 00:26:07.080 align:start position:0%
the decisions on on which possible
 
00:26:09.990 --> 00:26:10.000 align:start position:0%
criminal background issues uh might
 
00:26:12.230 --> 00:26:12.240 align:start position:0%
disqualify or not that's still with the
 
00:26:15.310 --> 00:26:15.320 align:start position:0%
boards is that correct yes okay yes but
 
00:26:17.470 --> 00:26:17.480 align:start position:0%
is the process going to be administered
 
00:26:20.789 --> 00:26:20.799 align:start position:0%
and managed by oplc which might help
 
00:26:22.710 --> 00:26:22.720 align:start position:0%
with some of this I would certainly hope
 
00:26:22.720 --> 00:26:24.070 align:start position:0%
with some of this I would certainly hope
so

00:26:24.070 --> 00:26:24.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:26:26.789 --> 00:26:26.799 align:start position:0%
um but is is there some yes we have
 
00:26:28.669 --> 00:26:28.679 align:start position:0%
somebody here from the PLC if you'd care
 
00:26:28.679 --> 00:26:33.870 align:start position:0%
somebody here from the PLC if you'd care
to

00:26:33.870 --> 00:26:33.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:38.909 --> 00:26:38.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:41.789 --> 00:26:41.799 align:start position:0%
yes Bethany Katrell division director at
 
00:26:44.669 --> 00:26:44.679 align:start position:0%
oplc um we are currently working with
 
00:26:47.549 --> 00:26:47.559 align:start position:0%
our national regulatory agency clear who
 
00:26:49.269 --> 00:26:49.279 align:start position:0%
is going to help us work with each of
 
00:26:51.950 --> 00:26:51.960 align:start position:0%
the boards to set those rules and re
 
00:26:53.870 --> 00:26:53.880 align:start position:0%
requirements to go through the process
 
00:26:57.830 --> 00:26:57.840 align:start position:0%
so that way they can outline um what
 
00:27:01.029 --> 00:27:01.039 align:start position:0%
falls under 332g how that affects those
 
00:27:03.669 --> 00:27:03.679 align:start position:0%
license types um and then we will have a
 
00:27:06.549 --> 00:27:06.559 align:start position:0%
process inhouse for the appropriate
 
00:27:08.310 --> 00:27:08.320 align:start position:0%
hearings so that way we it will
 
00:27:10.310 --> 00:27:10.320 align:start position:0%
streamline that process as well all
 
00:27:12.630 --> 00:27:12.640 align:start position:0%
right thank you are you working on
 
00:27:15.549 --> 00:27:15.559 align:start position:0%
getting the pre-clearance involved
 
00:27:17.470 --> 00:27:17.480 align:start position:0%
because that was something we put into
 
00:27:19.590 --> 00:27:19.600 align:start position:0%
law just recently I didn't hear the
 
00:27:20.430 --> 00:27:20.440 align:start position:0%
first part of that representative
 
00:27:23.070 --> 00:27:23.080 align:start position:0%
McGuire I'm sorry the requirement that
 
00:27:25.430 --> 00:27:25.440 align:start position:0%
somebody can petition a board to say
 
00:27:27.630 --> 00:27:27.640 align:start position:0%
this is my criminal record would it
 
00:27:31.990 --> 00:27:32.000 align:start position:0%
disqualify me so um yes so they can do a
 
00:27:34.669 --> 00:27:34.679 align:start position:0%
declaratory ruling or a waiver for that
 
00:27:37.110 --> 00:27:37.120 align:start position:0%
request but the goal is to our goal in
 
00:27:39.070 --> 00:27:39.080 align:start position:0%
the office in some other states Texas is
 
00:27:41.350 --> 00:27:41.360 align:start position:0%
one is to be able to have all of this
 
00:27:43.669 --> 00:27:43.679 align:start position:0%
outlined so that way it's on the website
 
00:27:46.509 --> 00:27:46.519 align:start position:0%
prior to them even applying to say these
 
00:27:48.269 --> 00:27:48.279 align:start position:0%
are the types of charges that would
 
00:27:50.350 --> 00:27:50.360 align:start position:0%
disqualify you but here's how you could
 
00:27:52.750 --> 00:27:52.760 align:start position:0%
request a waiver or still
 
00:27:55.909 --> 00:27:55.919 align:start position:0%
apply okay I'm so you're working on it
 
00:28:06.590 --> 00:28:06.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:10.269 --> 00:28:10.279 align:start position:0%
you observations 10 and 11 start on page
 
00:28:12.950 --> 00:28:12.960 align:start position:0%
68 and address the need to develop rules
 
00:28:15.590 --> 00:28:15.600 align:start position:0%
for some licensing processes used by the
 
00:28:17.310 --> 00:28:17.320 align:start position:0%
boards as well as ensuring those
 
00:28:19.310 --> 00:28:19.320 align:start position:0%
requirements are clearly and
 
00:28:21.990 --> 00:28:22.000 align:start position:0%
consistently applied we found rules were
 
00:28:24.029 --> 00:28:24.039 align:start position:0%
not developed for obtaining a license as
 
00:28:26.350 --> 00:28:26.360 align:start position:0%
a licensed social worker licensed Social
 
00:28:29.310 --> 00:28:29.320 align:start position:0%
Work associate School social worker or
 
00:28:31.990 --> 00:28:32.000 align:start position:0%
school psychologist additionally some
 
00:28:33.830 --> 00:28:33.840 align:start position:0%
processes used by the boards were not
 
00:28:35.789 --> 00:28:35.799 align:start position:0%
outlined in their rules while some
 
00:28:37.470 --> 00:28:37.480 align:start position:0%
processes were unclear and
 
00:28:40.310 --> 00:28:40.320 align:start position:0%
inconsistently applied in
 
00:28:46.990 --> 00:28:47.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:50.029 --> 00:28:50.039 align:start position:0%
one Madam chair yes please thank you
 
00:28:51.549 --> 00:28:51.559 align:start position:0%
could could you repeat that for me
 
00:28:53.590 --> 00:28:53.600 align:start position:0%
please it was it was short but I I
 
00:28:55.350 --> 00:28:55.360 align:start position:0%
missed part of the beginning sure they
 
00:28:57.110 --> 00:28:57.120 align:start position:0%
they did not have processes is that what
 
00:28:59.070 --> 00:28:59.080 align:start position:0%
you said so they didn't have uh
 
00:29:01.430 --> 00:29:01.440 align:start position:0%
requirements in outlined in rules for
 
00:29:03.870 --> 00:29:03.880 align:start position:0%
certain license types so a licensed
 
00:29:05.389 --> 00:29:05.399 align:start position:0%
social worker there were no rules during
 
00:29:08.029 --> 00:29:08.039 align:start position:0%
the audit period for that um licensed
 
00:29:10.630 --> 00:29:10.640 align:start position:0%
Social Work associate School uh School
 
00:29:12.389 --> 00:29:12.399 align:start position:0%
social worker and school psychologist
 
00:29:14.990 --> 00:29:15.000 align:start position:0%
there were no rules on that at all um we
 
00:29:17.190 --> 00:29:17.200 align:start position:0%
also found that some processes that were
 
00:29:18.909 --> 00:29:18.919 align:start position:0%
used by the boards weren't outlined in
 
00:29:21.389 --> 00:29:21.399 align:start position:0%
their rules so it was a process that was
 
00:29:24.509 --> 00:29:24.519 align:start position:0%
imposed on people uh outside of the
 
00:29:27.430 --> 00:29:27.440 align:start position:0%
agency that just was not outlined
 
00:29:29.470 --> 00:29:29.480 align:start position:0%
anywhere and then some of the processes
 
00:29:38.990 --> 00:29:39.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:42.389 --> 00:29:42.399 align:start position:0%
applied so finally observation 12 which
 
00:29:44.789 --> 00:29:44.799 align:start position:0%
may require legislative action starts on
 
00:29:48.110 --> 00:29:48.120 align:start position:0%
page 75 and addresses exam requirements
 
00:29:49.990 --> 00:29:50.000 align:start position:0%
that may be too restrictive that they
 
00:29:52.350 --> 00:29:52.360 align:start position:0%
delay licensing or hinder portability
 
00:29:54.190 --> 00:29:54.200 align:start position:0%
for applicants already licensed in
 
00:29:56.830 --> 00:29:56.840 align:start position:0%
another state during the audit period
 
00:29:58.909 --> 00:29:58.919 align:start position:0%
two board boards required applicants
 
00:30:00.990 --> 00:30:01.000 align:start position:0%
submit a written case study or answer
 
00:30:03.750 --> 00:30:03.760 align:start position:0%
essay questions the process requires
 
00:30:05.470 --> 00:30:05.480 align:start position:0%
case-by case analysis of each
 
00:30:07.710 --> 00:30:07.720 align:start position:0%
application which hinders streamlining
 
00:30:09.870 --> 00:30:09.880 align:start position:0%
and potentially results in
 
00:30:12.029 --> 00:30:12.039 align:start position:0%
inefficiencies finally state laws
 
00:30:14.710 --> 00:30:14.720 align:start position:0%
allowed boards to define the exam
 
00:30:17.789 --> 00:30:17.799 align:start position:0%
requirements for most professions
 
00:30:19.669 --> 00:30:19.679 align:start position:0%
however state laws regarding exams for
 
00:30:21.269 --> 00:30:21.279 align:start position:0%
licensed clinical Mental Health
 
00:30:22.750 --> 00:30:22.760 align:start position:0%
Counselors and marriage and family
 
00:30:25.350 --> 00:30:25.360 align:start position:0%
therapists were more prescriptive naming
 
00:30:28.230 --> 00:30:28.240 align:start position:0%
the specific exam or examination body in
 
00:30:30.590 --> 00:30:30.600 align:start position:0%
statute this would prevent a licensed
 
00:30:32.710 --> 00:30:32.720 align:start position:0%
clinical mental health counselor already
 
00:30:34.389 --> 00:30:34.399 align:start position:0%
practicing in another state from being
 
00:30:36.669 --> 00:30:36.679 align:start position:0%
licensed in New Hampshire if they passed
 
00:30:38.830 --> 00:30:38.840 align:start position:0%
a different exam the prescriptive
 
00:30:40.549 --> 00:30:40.559 align:start position:0%
language could also create a similar
 
00:30:44.029 --> 00:30:44.039 align:start position:0%
restriction for marriage and family
 
00:30:46.909 --> 00:30:46.919 align:start position:0%
therapists any questions on that one
 
00:30:48.990 --> 00:30:49.000 align:start position:0%
repr laus and then
 
00:30:53.310 --> 00:30:53.320 align:start position:0%
gr thank you um so as I recall there
 
00:30:56.830 --> 00:30:56.840 align:start position:0%
were some changes in statute last year
 
00:30:58.509 --> 00:30:58.519 align:start position:0%
around around I forget the exact
 
00:31:02.549 --> 00:31:02.559 align:start position:0%
language but um subjective or the essay
 
00:31:05.389 --> 00:31:05.399 align:start position:0%
essay questions and if I recall
 
00:31:07.389 --> 00:31:07.399 align:start position:0%
correctly those actually aren't
 
00:31:09.950 --> 00:31:09.960 align:start position:0%
permitted anymore is there's somebody
 
00:31:11.870 --> 00:31:11.880 align:start position:0%
I'm getting a headshake from a lady from
 
00:31:15.470 --> 00:31:15.480 align:start position:0%
oplc the board the response to that
 
00:31:17.629 --> 00:31:17.639 align:start position:0%
finding was the board of psychologists
 
00:31:19.269 --> 00:31:19.279 align:start position:0%
said they agree with the recommendation
 
00:31:20.950 --> 00:31:20.960 align:start position:0%
and they've removed written essays from
 
00:31:23.269 --> 00:31:23.279 align:start position:0%
its requirement ah excellent thank you
 
00:31:24.789 --> 00:31:24.799 align:start position:0%
and the lead out board has also
 
00:31:27.230 --> 00:31:27.240 align:start position:0%
developed their rules to eliminate their
 
00:31:29.909 --> 00:31:29.919 align:start position:0%
written um case study uh requirement as
 
00:31:31.590 --> 00:31:31.600 align:start position:0%
well okay thank you you're welcome
 
00:31:33.830 --> 00:31:33.840 align:start position:0%
that's so nice to hear they've
 
00:31:36.230 --> 00:31:36.240 align:start position:0%
eliminated what was a major obstacle for
 
00:31:40.230 --> 00:31:40.240 align:start position:0%
a lot of people okay this concludes my
 
00:31:42.029 --> 00:31:42.039 align:start position:0%
presentation if you have other questions
 
00:31:43.669 --> 00:31:43.679 align:start position:0%
we'd be happy to answer them and Bethany
 
00:31:48.230 --> 00:31:48.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:50.990 --> 00:31:51.000 align:start position:0%
answer so I have a question you said
 
00:31:55.070 --> 00:31:55.080 align:start position:0%
that there's no requirement for for
 
00:31:58.029 --> 00:31:58.039 align:start position:0%
licensing social workers
 
00:32:01.190 --> 00:32:01.200 align:start position:0%
there were no rules in place so there
 
00:32:03.629 --> 00:32:03.639 align:start position:0%
were laws established certain
 
00:32:05.629 --> 00:32:05.639 align:start position:0%
requirements but the boards were also
 
00:32:08.669 --> 00:32:08.679 align:start position:0%
required to develop rules surrounding um
 
00:32:10.230 --> 00:32:10.240 align:start position:0%
those requirements and spelling them out
 
00:32:12.909 --> 00:32:12.919 align:start position:0%
a little bit more um and as far as the
 
00:32:14.950 --> 00:32:14.960 align:start position:0%
end of the audit they still had they had
 
00:32:16.830 --> 00:32:16.840 align:start position:0%
not developed those rules Bethany may be
 
00:32:20.669 --> 00:32:20.679 align:start position:0%
able to um give us a little bit more
 
00:32:20.679 --> 00:32:26.070 align:start position:0%
able to um give us a little bit more
insight

00:32:26.070 --> 00:32:26.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:26.080 --> 00:32:30.870 align:start position:0%
 
please

00:32:30.870 --> 00:32:30.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:33.389 --> 00:32:33.399 align:start position:0%
um the boards had been given this as a
 
00:32:35.629 --> 00:32:35.639 align:start position:0%
priority and so those rules have been
 
00:32:38.549 --> 00:32:38.559 align:start position:0%
drafted and are going to Jael car um
 
00:32:40.830 --> 00:32:40.840 align:start position:0%
this month so we are currently working
 
00:32:40.840 --> 00:32:42.310 align:start position:0%
this month so we are currently working
on

00:32:42.310 --> 00:32:42.320 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:32:42.320 --> 00:32:44.669 align:start position:0%
on
that

00:32:44.669 --> 00:32:44.679 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:32:48.549 --> 00:32:48.559 align:start position:0%
excellent all right representative Brown
 
00:32:51.470 --> 00:32:51.480 align:start position:0%
uh thank you madam chair going back I
 
00:32:53.110 --> 00:32:53.120 align:start position:0%
think to number
 
00:32:56.070 --> 00:32:56.080 align:start position:0%
four if if I understood what you said
 
00:32:56.080 --> 00:32:58.070 align:start position:0%
four if if I understood what you said
correctly

00:32:58.070 --> 00:32:58.080 align:start position:0%
correctly
 
00:33:00.750 --> 00:33:00.760 align:start position:0%
uh paraphrasing what you said that a
 
00:33:02.110 --> 00:33:02.120 align:start position:0%
number of boards haven't followed
 
00:33:04.549 --> 00:33:04.559 align:start position:0%
through on the law that requires them to
 
00:33:07.950 --> 00:33:07.960 align:start position:0%
adopt rules and I'm I'm not sure if
 
00:33:12.269 --> 00:33:12.279 align:start position:0%
you're talking about 332 RSA 332
 
00:33:12.279 --> 00:33:15.230 align:start position:0%
you're talking about 332 RSA 332
G7

00:33:15.230 --> 00:33:15.240 align:start position:0%
G7
 
00:33:17.789 --> 00:33:17.799 align:start position:0%
um working on this in another vein which
 
00:33:19.470 --> 00:33:19.480 align:start position:0%
is the only reason I happen to have this
 
00:33:23.470 --> 00:33:23.480 align:start position:0%
piece of paper but um it is there do you
 
00:33:25.870 --> 00:33:25.880 align:start position:0%
have a feel you you may not if the
 
00:33:28.789 --> 00:33:28.799 align:start position:0%
legislature put a timeline on that if
 
00:33:31.070 --> 00:33:31.080 align:start position:0%
that would help that process so under
 
00:33:33.190 --> 00:33:33.200 align:start position:0%
there there's it says every Board of
 
00:33:34.590 --> 00:33:34.600 align:start position:0%
commission shall it up rules but there
 
00:33:36.509 --> 00:33:36.519 align:start position:0%
is no timeline on
 
00:33:44.149 --> 00:33:44.159 align:start position:0%
it so as far as I recall um the rule
 
00:33:48.190 --> 00:33:48.200 align:start position:0%
the law requiring a process for uh to
 
00:33:49.629 --> 00:33:49.639 align:start position:0%
develop a process for military
 
00:33:52.430 --> 00:33:52.440 align:start position:0%
applicants has been in place since
 
00:33:56.070 --> 00:33:56.080 align:start position:0%
2014 um we finished our fieldwork in
 
00:33:58.509 --> 00:33:58.519 align:start position:0%
Andrea remind
 
00:34:00.789 --> 00:34:00.799 align:start position:0%
me Summer of
 
00:34:00.799 --> 00:34:02.470 align:start position:0%
me Summer of
2023

00:34:02.470 --> 00:34:02.480 align:start position:0%
2023
 
00:34:05.750 --> 00:34:05.760 align:start position:0%
so 11 years since uh the law was
 
00:34:08.430 --> 00:34:08.440 align:start position:0%
implemented and none of the boards had
 
00:34:13.710 --> 00:34:13.720 align:start position:0%
had um implemented these rules yet um
 
00:34:15.750 --> 00:34:15.760 align:start position:0%
so in
 
00:34:19.310 --> 00:34:19.320 align:start position:0%
2022 there was additional uh legislative
 
00:34:22.710 --> 00:34:22.720 align:start position:0%
changes to RSA 31016 that required the
 
00:34:26.069 --> 00:34:26.079 align:start position:0%
oplc to be responsible for issuing uh
 
00:34:27.389 --> 00:34:27.399 align:start position:0%
those licenses
 
00:34:30.190 --> 00:34:30.200 align:start position:0%
um for up to Temporary licenses for
 
00:34:31.950 --> 00:34:31.960 align:start position:0%
military uh
 
00:34:35.030 --> 00:34:35.040 align:start position:0%
Affiliated applications um so I think
 
00:34:38.069 --> 00:34:38.079 align:start position:0%
maybe the oplc could speak to how
 
00:34:44.349 --> 00:34:44.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:46.589 --> 00:34:46.599 align:start position:0%
process good morning Lindsay Courtney
 
00:34:47.909 --> 00:34:47.919 align:start position:0%
executive director
 
00:34:51.589 --> 00:34:51.599 align:start position:0%
oplc um yeah we are we do have rules in
 
00:34:53.470 --> 00:34:53.480 align:start position:0%
place that are required by RSA chapter
 
00:34:56.149 --> 00:34:56.159 align:start position:0%
310 I don't think that putting a time
 
00:34:58.150 --> 00:34:58.160 align:start position:0%
limit is going to solve the problem I
 
00:35:00.109 --> 00:35:00.119 align:start position:0%
think the problem is multifaceted I
 
00:35:02.430 --> 00:35:02.440 align:start position:0%
think it's a historic lack of internal
 
00:35:03.990 --> 00:35:04.000 align:start position:0%
controls which multiple performance
 
00:35:06.150 --> 00:35:06.160 align:start position:0%
audits have shown I think it
 
00:35:08.230 --> 00:35:08.240 align:start position:0%
historically has been a resource problem
 
00:35:11.030 --> 00:35:11.040 align:start position:0%
which we are resolving um and plan to
 
00:35:13.470 --> 00:35:13.480 align:start position:0%
contract out some of this work I think
 
00:35:16.150 --> 00:35:16.160 align:start position:0%
part of it is really just a not a desire
 
00:35:19.630 --> 00:35:19.640 align:start position:0%
to engage in that analysis you know few
 
00:35:22.950 --> 00:35:22.960 align:start position:0%
a few um professions um there's a
 
00:35:26.109 --> 00:35:26.119 align:start position:0%
there's always um that issue as well so
 
00:35:27.829 --> 00:35:27.839 align:start position:0%
I don't think it's Quick
 
00:35:31.270 --> 00:35:31.280 align:start position:0%
Fix um as you may recall we had the same
 
00:35:32.550 --> 00:35:32.560 align:start position:0%
language in
 
00:35:36.670 --> 00:35:36.680 align:start position:0%
332g and um in 594 you know essentially
 
00:35:38.230 --> 00:35:38.240 align:start position:0%
gave that authority to the office but it
 
00:35:40.430 --> 00:35:40.440 align:start position:0%
was the same problem you know language
 
00:35:42.829 --> 00:35:42.839 align:start position:0%
had existed for years and and really the
 
00:35:45.190 --> 00:35:45.200 align:start position:0%
rules had not been drafted but I'm very
 
00:35:47.310 --> 00:35:47.320 align:start position:0%
confident that as we move forward we
 
00:35:48.990 --> 00:35:49.000 align:start position:0%
establish internal controls we get
 
00:35:51.270 --> 00:35:51.280 align:start position:0%
additional rul making assistance we've
 
00:35:53.750 --> 00:35:53.760 align:start position:0%
standardized the procedures I'm very
 
00:35:55.630 --> 00:35:55.640 align:start position:0%
confident in the next year or two that
 
00:35:57.870 --> 00:35:57.880 align:start position:0%
we will have rules in place place um
 
00:35:59.309 --> 00:35:59.319 align:start position:0%
this is a high priority and we are
 
00:36:01.550 --> 00:36:01.560 align:start position:0%
working with dmav to get this
 
00:36:04.510 --> 00:36:04.520 align:start position:0%
done represent laus yeah and actually
 
00:36:06.910 --> 00:36:06.920 align:start position:0%
this might be for oplc and that is um I
 
00:36:08.069 --> 00:36:08.079 align:start position:0%
don't know if you've had a chance to
 
00:36:12.270 --> 00:36:12.280 align:start position:0%
look at it but uh the audit but um do
 
00:36:15.069 --> 00:36:15.079 align:start position:0%
you feel that the changes that were made
 
00:36:17.829 --> 00:36:17.839 align:start position:0%
in statute last year and the process to
 
00:36:19.630 --> 00:36:19.640 align:start position:0%
to have rules and put that all in place
 
00:36:21.910 --> 00:36:21.920 align:start position:0%
do you think that will address most all
 
00:36:25.190 --> 00:36:25.200 align:start position:0%
or whatever of the issues uh raised here
 
00:36:28.390 --> 00:36:28.400 align:start position:0%
certainly I think that uh I think that
 
00:36:30.630 --> 00:36:30.640 align:start position:0%
the legislative changes and the rules
 
00:36:32.270 --> 00:36:32.280 align:start position:0%
and the processes implementing those
 
00:36:34.470 --> 00:36:34.480 align:start position:0%
changes will address most of the issues
 
00:36:37.230 --> 00:36:37.240 align:start position:0%
that were identified in the audit um a
 
00:36:40.069 --> 00:36:40.079 align:start position:0%
lot of the challenges uh identified or
 
00:36:42.510 --> 00:36:42.520 align:start position:0%
the issues identified concerned
 
00:36:45.829 --> 00:36:45.839 align:start position:0%
endorsement um we we are resolving that
 
00:36:48.390 --> 00:36:48.400 align:start position:0%
with 594 and we have some interim rules
 
00:36:50.069 --> 00:36:50.079 align:start position:0%
in effect I think that covers all of
 
00:36:52.750 --> 00:36:52.760 align:start position:0%
these license types we are um we had
 
00:36:54.349 --> 00:36:54.359 align:start position:0%
filed our fiscal impact statement so
 
00:36:55.790 --> 00:36:55.800 align:start position:0%
we're moving forward with permanent rle
 
00:36:59.069 --> 00:36:59.079 align:start position:0%
making we're migrating to a new solution
 
00:37:03.230 --> 00:37:03.240 align:start position:0%
thankfully um very soon um which there
 
00:37:05.150 --> 00:37:05.160 align:start position:0%
are a lot of issues identified regarding
 
00:37:06.870 --> 00:37:06.880 align:start position:0%
the technological pieces which are
 
00:37:08.710 --> 00:37:08.720 align:start position:0%
outside of the opl's control outside of
 
00:37:10.589 --> 00:37:10.599 align:start position:0%
the board's control that the state
 
00:37:12.589 --> 00:37:12.599 align:start position:0%
really needs to see some
 
00:37:16.309 --> 00:37:16.319 align:start position:0%
improvements um and so yes we certainly
 
00:37:19.990 --> 00:37:20.000 align:start position:0%
I think have have or will resolve
 
00:37:22.670 --> 00:37:22.680 align:start position:0%
shortly most of the issues as a result
 
00:37:24.870 --> 00:37:24.880 align:start position:0%
of the legislative changes followup
 
00:37:26.950 --> 00:37:26.960 align:start position:0%
follow up um what what these
 
00:37:29.829 --> 00:37:29.839 align:start position:0%
technological issues you're referring to
 
00:37:32.349 --> 00:37:32.359 align:start position:0%
yes so if you the audit this audit and
 
00:37:35.030 --> 00:37:35.040 align:start position:0%
other audits discuss our licensing
 
00:37:37.309 --> 00:37:37.319 align:start position:0%
solution which is my license online
 
00:37:39.069 --> 00:37:39.079 align:start position:0%
which is a Statewide Enterprise Solution
 
00:37:40.190 --> 00:37:40.200 align:start position:0%
procured by the department of
 
00:37:44.910 --> 00:37:44.920 align:start position:0%
Information Technology it is um it is an
 
00:37:48.190 --> 00:37:48.200 align:start position:0%
old system it's uh it does not meet our
 
00:37:50.069 --> 00:37:50.079 align:start position:0%
needs there are some data Integrity
 
00:37:52.270 --> 00:37:52.280 align:start position:0%
issues it has not been managed well has
 
00:37:55.270 --> 00:37:55.280 align:start position:0%
not been resourced well it's it's really
 
00:37:57.230 --> 00:37:57.240 align:start position:0%
uh the last piece of the puzzle to to
 
00:37:59.950 --> 00:37:59.960 align:start position:0%
Bringing New Hampshire's licensing um
 
00:38:04.270 --> 00:38:04.280 align:start position:0%
into this Century in my opinion um but
 
00:38:05.589 --> 00:38:05.599 align:start position:0%
we're going we're working with
 
00:38:07.470 --> 00:38:07.480 align:start position:0%
partnering with do and we're getting it
 
00:38:10.030 --> 00:38:10.040 align:start position:0%
done okay one one more followup one
 
00:38:12.309 --> 00:38:12.319 align:start position:0%
follow um and that if you could if there
 
00:38:14.510 --> 00:38:14.520 align:start position:0%
are uh any of the legislative change
 
00:38:17.750 --> 00:38:17.760 align:start position:0%
requests in here that you think are not
 
00:38:19.550 --> 00:38:19.560 align:start position:0%
going to be covered by the existing
 
00:38:21.630 --> 00:38:21.640 align:start position:0%
changes rules and process if you could
 
00:38:23.510 --> 00:38:23.520 align:start position:0%
please let us know what those are
 
00:38:24.990 --> 00:38:25.000 align:start position:0%
certainly absolutely representative
 
00:38:28.030 --> 00:38:28.040 align:start position:0%
right thank you thank you okay
 
00:38:31.910 --> 00:38:31.920 align:start position:0%
represa if I may I have two um comments
 
00:38:34.470 --> 00:38:34.480 align:start position:0%
and one of them is to um to this
 
00:38:36.430 --> 00:38:36.440 align:start position:0%
afternoon we're having a a discussion
 
00:38:38.510 --> 00:38:38.520 align:start position:0%
about Ru making the rule making
 
00:38:41.510 --> 00:38:41.520 align:start position:0%
committee so I would love to be kept
 
00:38:44.349 --> 00:38:44.359 align:start position:0%
informed as to um how the how these
 
00:38:46.109 --> 00:38:46.119 align:start position:0%
rules are going to be implemented so the
 
00:38:49.710 --> 00:38:49.720 align:start position:0%
committee itself can can walk through it
 
00:38:51.150 --> 00:38:51.160 align:start position:0%
I think it would be a good example for
 
00:38:54.790 --> 00:38:54.800 align:start position:0%
everybody to learn um second of all I'm
 
00:38:57.190 --> 00:38:57.200 align:start position:0%
hopeful that after after we've all
 
00:38:59.470 --> 00:38:59.480 align:start position:0%
digested this we get a chance to sit
 
00:39:01.630 --> 00:39:01.640 align:start position:0%
down with you in a meeting and just go
 
00:39:03.910 --> 00:39:03.920 align:start position:0%
over these things so that we all are on
 
00:39:06.270 --> 00:39:06.280 align:start position:0%
the same page when we leave the room
 
00:39:08.710 --> 00:39:08.720 align:start position:0%
that would be helpful I think certainly
 
00:39:11.910 --> 00:39:11.920 align:start position:0%
we'd welcome that opportunity happy to
 
00:39:14.950 --> 00:39:14.960 align:start position:0%
host any other questions
 
00:39:14.960 --> 00:39:17.230 align:start position:0%
host any other questions
comments

00:39:17.230 --> 00:39:17.240 align:start position:0%

00:39:19.829 --> 00:39:19.839 align:start position:0%

us

03:02:31.870 --> 03:02:31.880 align:start position:0%
us
 
03:02:34.990 --> 03:02:35.000 align:start position:0%
hi so what I've asked um representative
 
03:02:38.790 --> 03:02:38.800 align:start position:0%
shu to do is actually because people in
 
03:02:41.550 --> 03:02:41.560 align:start position:0%
the committee who are in the rules
 
03:02:44.269 --> 03:02:44.279 align:start position:0%
committee that represent resentative shu
 
03:02:44.279 --> 03:02:45.790 align:start position:0%
committee that represent resentative shu
is

03:02:45.790 --> 03:02:45.800 align:start position:0%
is
 
03:02:48.550 --> 03:02:48.560 align:start position:0%
on they're getting that confused with
 
03:02:50.750 --> 03:02:50.760 align:start position:0%
our subcommittee which is on rulemaking
 
03:02:53.750 --> 03:02:53.760 align:start position:0%
so could we ask representative shu to
 
03:02:56.070 --> 03:02:56.080 align:start position:0%
Define them so that everyone knows what
 
03:02:57.630 --> 03:02:57.640 align:start position:0%
we're supposed to be doing I think
 
03:03:00.070 --> 03:03:00.080 align:start position:0%
that's a great idea yeah good luck
 
03:03:02.910 --> 03:03:02.920 align:start position:0%
Dan thanks for
 
03:03:06.030 --> 03:03:06.040 align:start position:0%
that um well my understanding is the
 
03:03:09.469 --> 03:03:09.479 align:start position:0%
subcommittee of Edna dealing with rules
 
03:03:12.990 --> 03:03:13.000 align:start position:0%
is basically to work on bills that are
 
03:03:15.630 --> 03:03:15.640 align:start position:0%
presented to the committee that have to
 
03:03:19.750 --> 03:03:19.760 align:start position:0%
do with rules and they will be heard and
 
03:03:22.590 --> 03:03:22.600 align:start position:0%
then the chair will assign them to our
 
03:03:24.790 --> 03:03:24.800 align:start position:0%
subcommittee if it's felt further
 
03:03:26.590 --> 03:03:26.600 align:start position:0%
investigation is
 
03:03:29.110 --> 03:03:29.120 align:start position:0%
necessary this committee from my
 
03:03:32.710 --> 03:03:32.720 align:start position:0%
understanding is looking at Ru making in
 
03:03:35.030 --> 03:03:35.040 align:start position:0%
general uh because obviously this
 
03:03:36.950 --> 03:03:36.960 align:start position:0%
committee is heavily involved with that
 
03:03:40.389 --> 03:03:40.399 align:start position:0%
and many of our members serve on jel car
 
03:03:42.990 --> 03:03:43.000 align:start position:0%
so that's the best I can do off the top
 
03:03:45.790 --> 03:03:45.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:50.389 --> 03:03:50.399 align:start position:0%
yeah represent leas so Ju Just so I
 
03:03:52.309 --> 03:03:52.319 align:start position:0%
understand which I I don't think I do uh
 
03:03:54.710 --> 03:03:54.720 align:start position:0%
so the committee that handles
 
03:03:56.910 --> 03:03:56.920 align:start position:0%
rules is it a matter mean if we have a
 
03:03:59.150 --> 03:03:59.160 align:start position:0%
bill that gives 541a rulle making
 
03:04:02.229 --> 03:04:02.239 align:start position:0%
authority to some you know to oplc or
 
03:04:06.030 --> 03:04:06.040 align:start position:0%
whatever that that committee looks at
 
03:04:08.750 --> 03:04:08.760 align:start position:0%
the rules that will probably are we want
 
03:04:12.309 --> 03:04:12.319 align:start position:0%
to have generated from that statute or
 
03:04:17.510 --> 03:04:17.520 align:start position:0%
no no no no the Diane's subcommittee yes
 
03:04:21.510 --> 03:04:21.520 align:start position:0%
looks at bills that address rules there
 
03:04:24.070 --> 03:04:24.080 align:start position:0%
are some bills that say per rul making
 
03:04:26.590 --> 03:04:26.600 align:start position:0%
for example and her subcommittee would
 
03:04:30.510 --> 03:04:30.520 align:start position:0%
look at that to make sure that um that
 
03:04:33.309 --> 03:04:33.319 align:start position:0%
the bill is written is clear enough or
 
03:04:35.389 --> 03:04:35.399 align:start position:0%
doesn't need any any Amendment so is
 
03:04:37.389 --> 03:04:37.399 align:start position:0%
that a bill that would change
 
03:04:41.309 --> 03:04:41.319 align:start position:0%
541a no okay I'm missing it okay okay so
 
03:04:43.990 --> 03:04:44.000 align:start position:0%
let's say we have a
 
03:04:46.190 --> 03:04:46.200 align:start position:0%
a bill that says let's just just use the
 
03:04:48.830 --> 03:04:48.840 align:start position:0%
example of last year where we had the
 
03:04:51.630 --> 03:04:51.640 align:start position:0%
hairdressing Bill and it said that the
 
03:04:53.429 --> 03:04:53.439 align:start position:0%
Board of
 
03:04:56.870 --> 03:04:56.880 align:start position:0%
Cosmetology would issue licenses based
 
03:05:00.670 --> 03:05:00.680 align:start position:0%
on Ru making on their rul making we have
 
03:05:03.309 --> 03:05:03.319 align:start position:0%
nothing to do with those rules but her
 
03:05:05.710 --> 03:05:05.720 align:start position:0%
subcommittee would look at that bill to
 
03:05:08.469 --> 03:05:08.479 align:start position:0%
see if it was a if it apply if it was
 
03:05:11.150 --> 03:05:11.160 align:start position:0%
referring to the right statute or it
 
03:05:13.990 --> 03:05:14.000 align:start position:0%
would look at the vehicle the bill
 
03:05:18.389 --> 03:05:18.399 align:start position:0%
itself okay we whereas this
 
03:05:22.990 --> 03:05:23.000 align:start position:0%
committee which is Diane me Shane and
 
03:05:27.990 --> 03:05:28.000 align:start position:0%
Matt looks at specific rule making that
 
03:05:30.750 --> 03:05:30.760 align:start position:0%
has to do with bills that are under the
 
03:05:33.429 --> 03:05:33.439 align:start position:0%
offices of this committee okay each
 
03:05:37.870 --> 03:05:37.880 align:start position:0%
committee has a Ru making group that is
 
03:05:41.469 --> 03:05:41.479 align:start position:0%
looking at the rules that apply to bills
 
03:05:45.550 --> 03:05:45.560 align:start position:0%
underneath their so that they understand
 
03:05:47.990 --> 03:05:48.000 align:start position:0%
that the rules
 
03:05:52.030 --> 03:05:52.040 align:start position:0%
are that are that are written do not
 
03:05:54.389 --> 03:05:54.399 align:start position:0%
conflict with the legislative intent of
 
03:05:54.399 --> 03:05:56.190 align:start position:0%
conflict with the legislative intent of
the

03:05:56.190 --> 03:05:56.200 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:05:58.429 --> 03:05:58.439 align:start position:0%
rule um just so you're I just want to
 
03:06:00.550 --> 03:06:00.560 align:start position:0%
make sure you and have you follow me so
 
03:06:03.590 --> 03:06:03.600 align:start position:0%
far I have a followup question if I I
 
03:06:06.309 --> 03:06:06.319 align:start position:0%
could this may hopefully answer your
 
03:06:09.190 --> 03:06:09.200 align:start position:0%
question um the speaker has said you
 
03:06:11.830 --> 03:06:11.840 align:start position:0%
know the speaker was anxious to get more
 
03:06:14.830 --> 03:06:14.840 align:start position:0%
members of the legislature involved with
 
03:06:16.830 --> 03:06:16.840 align:start position:0%
the administrative rules that are being
 
03:06:21.510 --> 03:06:21.520 align:start position:0%
made and he has requested each policy
 
03:06:24.670 --> 03:06:24.680 align:start position:0%
committee to have a group like this to
 
03:06:27.950 --> 03:06:27.960 align:start position:0%
look at rules that are involved with the
 
03:06:31.670 --> 03:06:31.680 align:start position:0%
policy they are enacting okay and that's
 
03:06:34.190 --> 03:06:34.200 align:start position:0%
that I that I get okay the question I
 
03:06:35.910 --> 03:06:35.920 align:start position:0%
had is on the first one so you're
 
03:06:38.870 --> 03:06:38.880 align:start position:0%
looking at a bill that gives or changes
 
03:06:41.190 --> 03:06:41.200 align:start position:0%
some rul making authority to an
 
03:06:43.389 --> 03:06:43.399 align:start position:0%
agency um so it might be things things
 
03:06:45.790 --> 03:06:45.800 align:start position:0%
like you know does my this is my
 
03:06:48.110 --> 03:06:48.120 align:start position:0%
question is this correct so it might
 
03:06:50.910 --> 03:06:50.920 align:start position:0%
provide look at it and say you know does
 
03:06:54.429 --> 03:06:54.439 align:start position:0%
the statute provide proper guidance to
 
03:06:56.190 --> 03:06:56.200 align:start position:0%
the rul making process that we're asking
 
03:06:57.990 --> 03:06:58.000 align:start position:0%
to take place something like that is
 
03:07:00.550 --> 03:07:00.560 align:start position:0%
that okay all right thank
 
03:07:04.229 --> 03:07:04.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:10.110 --> 03:07:10.120 align:start position:0%
think um okay so one of the things that
 
03:07:13.870 --> 03:07:13.880 align:start position:0%
uh well this was a couple of terms ago
 
03:07:15.429 --> 03:07:15.439 align:start position:0%
but I think everybody on the committee
 
03:07:17.389 --> 03:07:17.399 align:start position:0%
was already there may maybe you weren't
 
03:07:21.750 --> 03:07:21.760 align:start position:0%
Matt um but um this was going to be a
 
03:07:24.309 --> 03:07:24.319 align:start position:0%
bill that was going to change Jael car
 
03:07:27.389 --> 03:07:27.399 align:start position:0%
fund fundamentally okay
 
03:07:30.229 --> 03:07:30.239 align:start position:0%
fundamentally Bill I'm just saying I'm
 
03:07:32.630 --> 03:07:32.640 align:start position:0%
just saying that one of the things that
 
03:07:36.190 --> 03:07:36.200 align:start position:0%
was part of that bill was the idea that
 
03:07:40.110 --> 03:07:40.120 align:start position:0%
that every bill that
 
03:07:44.830 --> 03:07:44.840 align:start position:0%
involved a profession for example
 
03:07:47.150 --> 03:07:47.160 align:start position:0%
was was going to after the rule after
 
03:07:49.830 --> 03:07:49.840 align:start position:0%
Jael car weighed in on it and approved
 
03:07:52.429 --> 03:07:52.439 align:start position:0%
rules that rule was then going to come
 
03:07:55.150 --> 03:07:55.160 align:start position:0%
back to the policy committee for
 
03:07:57.630 --> 03:07:57.640 align:start position:0%
approval as well now that doesn't really
 
03:08:00.030 --> 03:08:00.040 align:start position:0%
work and it's I think I think it's
 
03:08:02.550 --> 03:08:02.560 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional but this may have
 
03:08:05.790 --> 03:08:05.800 align:start position:0%
something along that line I think it
 
03:08:07.269 --> 03:08:07.279 align:start position:0%
provided for the opportunity for the
 
03:08:08.910 --> 03:08:08.920 align:start position:0%
committee to get invol but yeah the
 
03:08:10.910 --> 03:08:10.920 align:start position:0%
intent of this
 
03:08:13.790 --> 03:08:13.800 align:start position:0%
subcommittee which is on every single
 
03:08:17.429 --> 03:08:17.439 align:start position:0%
policy committee is to prevent that
 
03:08:20.309 --> 03:08:20.319 align:start position:0%
before the rules become are presented to
 
03:08:24.070 --> 03:08:24.080 align:start position:0%
Jael car if there is a concern or
 
03:08:27.870 --> 03:08:27.880 align:start position:0%
objection raised by the by the policy
 
03:08:30.429 --> 03:08:30.439 align:start position:0%
committee it will be done earlier in the
 
03:08:35.030 --> 03:08:35.040 align:start position:0%
rule M making process as opposed to um
 
03:08:37.550 --> 03:08:37.560 align:start position:0%
so let's just take for
 
03:08:41.910 --> 03:08:41.920 align:start position:0%
example how Matt and I Diane and Shane
 
03:08:44.990 --> 03:08:45.000 align:start position:0%
Envision this every week we get from
 
03:08:45.000 --> 03:08:46.510 align:start position:0%
Envision this every week we get from
Danielle

03:08:46.510 --> 03:08:46.520 align:start position:0%
Danielle
 
03:08:53.110 --> 03:08:53.120 align:start position:0%
rberg a registry of rules that are under
 
03:08:56.510 --> 03:08:56.520 align:start position:0%
process we look at that the four of us
 
03:08:59.950 --> 03:08:59.960 align:start position:0%
look at that registry and we say aha
 
03:09:02.870 --> 03:09:02.880 align:start position:0%
here is a rule that applies
 
03:09:05.429 --> 03:09:05.439 align:start position:0%
to I'm going to make something up the
 
03:09:09.030 --> 03:09:09.040 align:start position:0%
building codes or oplc or the New
 
03:09:10.870 --> 03:09:10.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire retirement system they're
 
03:09:15.190 --> 03:09:15.200 align:start position:0%
under our purview right as a policy as a
 
03:09:18.229 --> 03:09:18.239 align:start position:0%
policy committee we will discuss this
 
03:09:21.389 --> 03:09:21.399 align:start position:0%
this with the members of the committee
 
03:09:25.590 --> 03:09:25.600 align:start position:0%
to make sure that that the rule process
 
03:09:28.630 --> 03:09:28.640 align:start position:0%
is in agreement with the legislative
 
03:09:31.910 --> 03:09:31.920 align:start position:0%
intent of the law that we passed in the
 
03:09:35.030 --> 03:09:35.040 align:start position:0%
house that went through this
 
03:09:37.950 --> 03:09:37.960 align:start position:0%
committee that that's that is possibly a
 
03:09:39.990 --> 03:09:40.000 align:start position:0%
good idea one of the problems it was
 
03:09:43.030 --> 03:09:43.040 align:start position:0%
going to have is how is that going to
 
03:09:45.950 --> 03:09:45.960 align:start position:0%
work in the months when the policy
 
03:09:48.990 --> 03:09:49.000 align:start position:0%
committee ain't meeting because Jael car
 
03:09:51.630 --> 03:09:51.640 align:start position:0%
meets every month at least once and
 
03:09:54.910 --> 03:09:54.920 align:start position:0%
twice if necessary and and and those
 
03:09:58.429 --> 03:09:58.439 align:start position:0%
rules are considered and the the Jael
 
03:09:58.439 --> 03:09:59.510 align:start position:0%
rules are considered and the the Jael
car

03:09:59.510 --> 03:09:59.520 align:start position:0%
car
 
03:10:03.590 --> 03:10:03.600 align:start position:0%
cannot um cannot pocket veto something
 
03:10:06.150 --> 03:10:06.160 align:start position:0%
we we have a we have a deadline
 
03:10:09.670 --> 03:10:09.680 align:start position:0%
requirement for acting on a on a rule
 
03:10:11.110 --> 03:10:11.120 align:start position:0%
and how's that going to work in a
 
03:10:13.630 --> 03:10:13.640 align:start position:0%
September October November when the when
 
03:10:16.550 --> 03:10:16.560 align:start position:0%
the when our committee is not meeting
 
03:10:18.950 --> 03:10:18.960 align:start position:0%
well I will first of all Peter I'm glad
 
03:10:21.229 --> 03:10:21.239 align:start position:0%
that you're asking that question because
 
03:10:23.269 --> 03:10:23.279 align:start position:0%
you have a sense of optimism which I
 
03:10:26.910 --> 03:10:26.920 align:start position:0%
must tell you I am very you know I I
 
03:10:29.469 --> 03:10:29.479 align:start position:0%
know what's involved here and I wish I
 
03:10:31.710 --> 03:10:31.720 align:start position:0%
was as optimistic as you that we could
 
03:10:34.429 --> 03:10:34.439 align:start position:0%
get this thing going I'm not optimistic
 
03:10:36.590 --> 03:10:36.600 align:start position:0%
I'm just telling you the problem I have
 
03:10:38.429 --> 03:10:38.439 align:start position:0%
right off the B right well I'm going to
 
03:10:40.510 --> 03:10:40.520 align:start position:0%
we'll ask that question and we will get
 
03:10:41.830 --> 03:10:41.840 align:start position:0%
back to
 
03:10:41.840 --> 03:10:43.349 align:start position:0%
back to
you

03:10:43.349 --> 03:10:43.359 align:start position:0%
you
 
03:10:45.110 --> 03:10:45.120 align:start position:0%
I think the intent is that we would also
 
03:10:49.110 --> 03:10:49.120 align:start position:0%
be meeting through the summer months um
 
03:10:50.590 --> 03:10:50.600 align:start position:0%
I think that's the intent I'm not sure
 
03:10:53.429 --> 03:10:53.439 align:start position:0%
that that will manifest itself as often
 
03:10:55.590 --> 03:10:55.600 align:start position:0%
as they would like for it to happen but
 
03:10:58.469 --> 03:10:58.479 align:start position:0%
that is so we like um representative
 
03:11:00.190 --> 03:11:00.200 align:start position:0%
grto was saying we'll review the
 
03:11:03.070 --> 03:11:03.080 align:start position:0%
register week in and week out um
 
03:11:05.510 --> 03:11:05.520 align:start position:0%
we've kind of talked about the idea of
 
03:11:07.030 --> 03:11:07.040 align:start position:0%
splitting it up week by week so that
 
03:11:08.510 --> 03:11:08.520 align:start position:0%
each of us will take a week in turn so
 
03:11:11.269 --> 03:11:11.279 align:start position:0%
that we're not on it all of the time and
 
03:11:13.030 --> 03:11:13.040 align:start position:0%
um at least three of the four of us have
 
03:11:15.510 --> 03:11:15.520 align:start position:0%
a you guys more than me but have
 
03:11:18.190 --> 03:11:18.200 align:start position:0%
experience dealing with it um and then
 
03:11:20.510 --> 03:11:20.520 align:start position:0%
Shane has a lot more obligations outside
 
03:11:21.870 --> 03:11:21.880 align:start position:0%
so maybe we can help him a little bit
 
03:11:24.150 --> 03:11:24.160 align:start position:0%
more with his share of it um but we'll
 
03:11:25.349 --> 03:11:25.359 align:start position:0%
take a look at the rules that are coming
 
03:11:27.389 --> 03:11:27.399 align:start position:0%
up maybe just meet go over the rule that
 
03:11:29.910 --> 03:11:29.920 align:start position:0%
we've seen make comment as to whether or
 
03:11:32.110 --> 03:11:32.120 align:start position:0%
not there's concern with something we
 
03:11:33.870 --> 03:11:33.880 align:start position:0%
can discuss that and you know take it
 
03:11:36.269 --> 03:11:36.279 align:start position:0%
from there but I I did review the rules
 
03:11:38.070 --> 03:11:38.080 align:start position:0%
from this last register so I'm prepared
 
03:11:40.510 --> 03:11:40.520 align:start position:0%
to bring that up I'm not sure if you've
 
03:11:41.990 --> 03:11:42.000 align:start position:0%
had a chance to do that or not but I I
 
03:11:43.309 --> 03:11:43.319 align:start position:0%
did look at it so
 
03:11:44.630 --> 03:11:44.640 align:start position:0%
I just also want to make sure that
 
03:11:46.830 --> 03:11:46.840 align:start position:0%
everybody knows that our meetings are
 
03:11:50.389 --> 03:11:50.399 align:start position:0%
public so they will be occurring here
 
03:11:52.190 --> 03:11:52.200 align:start position:0%
and they will be they will be on the SK
 
03:11:54.110 --> 03:11:54.120 align:start position:0%
on the calendar and we will probably
 
03:11:56.590 --> 03:11:56.600 align:start position:0%
refer to a rule because we have to refer
 
03:11:59.070 --> 03:11:59.080 align:start position:0%
to something on the calendar right that
 
03:12:01.710 --> 03:12:01.720 align:start position:0%
has to be ironed of too with the clerk
 
03:12:04.950 --> 03:12:04.960 align:start position:0%
right and and I'll State further I I'm
 
03:12:07.990 --> 03:12:08.000 align:start position:0%
pretty sure that J car usually only
 
03:12:10.429 --> 03:12:10.439 align:start position:0%
meets about once a month during the
 
03:12:13.229 --> 03:12:13.239 align:start position:0%
summer um it meets once a month
 
03:12:16.190 --> 03:12:16.200 align:start position:0%
year round well there are once a month
 
03:12:19.309 --> 03:12:19.319 align:start position:0%
or twice if the if our burden our work
 
03:12:21.469 --> 03:12:21.479 align:start position:0%
burden requires it right maybe twice a
 
03:12:23.830 --> 03:12:23.840 align:start position:0%
month year round every month the Jael
 
03:12:25.590 --> 03:12:25.600 align:start position:0%
Cary but during the summer it's usually
 
03:12:28.469 --> 03:12:28.479 align:start position:0%
once a month so it's not going to be a
 
03:12:30.510 --> 03:12:30.520 align:start position:0%
heavy burden it's usually once a month
 
03:12:33.469 --> 03:12:33.479 align:start position:0%
anyway because we're able to get through
 
03:12:36.150 --> 03:12:36.160 align:start position:0%
oured that if I if if I could make a
 
03:12:39.389 --> 03:12:39.399 align:start position:0%
request that we we conduct this meeting
 
03:12:42.790 --> 03:12:42.800 align:start position:0%
a little bit more uh more intentionally
 
03:12:44.630 --> 03:12:44.640 align:start position:0%
so we're not talking over each other
 
03:12:45.670 --> 03:12:45.680 align:start position:0%
that would probably good it's kind of
 
03:12:47.150 --> 03:12:47.160 align:start position:0%
turned into just a conversation at the
 
03:12:49.150 --> 03:12:49.160 align:start position:0%
table uh if we take turns that would
 
03:12:50.830 --> 03:12:50.840 align:start position:0%
probably be good representatively did
 
03:12:52.349 --> 03:12:52.359 align:start position:0%
you want to share something yeah I think
 
03:12:53.910 --> 03:12:53.920 align:start position:0%
representative gr made it answer my
 
03:12:55.790 --> 03:12:55.800 align:start position:0%
question because I was going to ask if
 
03:12:58.990 --> 03:12:59.000 align:start position:0%
uh the committee as a whole had some way
 
03:13:02.389 --> 03:13:02.399 align:start position:0%
of finding out what um rules the
 
03:13:03.870 --> 03:13:03.880 align:start position:0%
subcommittee was going to address in
 
03:13:05.469 --> 03:13:05.479 align:start position:0%
case we have an interest and if they're
 
03:13:06.710 --> 03:13:06.720 align:start position:0%
going to be in the
 
03:13:08.670 --> 03:13:08.680 align:start position:0%
calendar yeah I think it's it's going to
 
03:13:09.870 --> 03:13:09.880 align:start position:0%
be one of those situations where we're
 
03:13:11.150 --> 03:13:11.160 align:start position:0%
going to have to wait for the register
 
03:13:12.870 --> 03:13:12.880 align:start position:0%
to come out it comes out Thursday after
 
03:13:15.510 --> 03:13:15.520 align:start position:0%
afternoons um see what's in there and
 
03:13:18.150 --> 03:13:18.160 align:start position:0%
then set a meeting with the rules listed
 
03:13:19.990 --> 03:13:20.000 align:start position:0%
for the one from the previous register
 
03:13:22.110 --> 03:13:22.120 align:start position:0%
and then my assumption is the meetings
 
03:13:23.830 --> 03:13:23.840 align:start position:0%
won't be terribly long most of the time
 
03:13:25.429 --> 03:13:25.439 align:start position:0%
so it'll probably be on the front end or
 
03:13:28.630 --> 03:13:28.640 align:start position:0%
back end of a of a committee full
 
03:13:33.070 --> 03:13:33.080 align:start position:0%
committee meeting um so yeses go so
 
03:13:34.870 --> 03:13:34.880 align:start position:0%
representative Simon would you kindly
 
03:13:37.429 --> 03:13:37.439 align:start position:0%
tell us what was in this week's report I
 
03:13:39.510 --> 03:13:39.520 align:start position:0%
would love to thank you for asking um so
 
03:13:43.590 --> 03:13:43.600 align:start position:0%
we had two rules um PLC uh 1700 00 which
 
03:13:46.469 --> 03:13:46.479 align:start position:0%
regulates the um Prof uh regulates
 
03:13:49.309 --> 03:13:49.319 align:start position:0%
professional bail bondsmen um it was
 
03:13:51.630 --> 03:13:51.640 align:start position:0%
just the initial publication calling for
 
03:13:53.510 --> 03:13:53.520 align:start position:0%
public hearing for input uh we've never
 
03:13:56.469 --> 03:13:56.479 align:start position:0%
had professional um bail bouns before so
 
03:13:58.750 --> 03:13:58.760 align:start position:0%
this is a completely new thing uh it was
 
03:14:00.790 --> 03:14:00.800 align:start position:0%
put under their purview last year uh it
 
03:14:03.070 --> 03:14:03.080 align:start position:0%
was under Insurance before that so this
 
03:14:05.750 --> 03:14:05.760 align:start position:0%
is a a new thing for oplc uh to be
 
03:14:08.150 --> 03:14:08.160 align:start position:0%
handling so they've put out a request a
 
03:14:10.030 --> 03:14:10.040 align:start position:0%
request for public input uh the meeting
 
03:14:11.710 --> 03:14:11.720 align:start position:0%
is going to be early February I think it
 
03:14:13.950 --> 03:14:13.960 align:start position:0%
was February 6th
 
03:14:16.269 --> 03:14:16.279 align:start position:0%
um and they haven't written anything on
 
03:14:17.550 --> 03:14:17.560 align:start position:0%
that yet so there's really nothing to
 
03:14:20.590 --> 03:14:20.600 align:start position:0%
discuss uh the second is PLC 1600 and
 
03:14:21.990 --> 03:14:22.000 align:start position:0%
that had to deal with the registration
 
03:14:24.349 --> 03:14:24.359 align:start position:0%
of uh nursing agencies uh which we
 
03:14:27.269 --> 03:14:27.279 align:start position:0%
talked about a lot last year um actually
 
03:14:29.790 --> 03:14:29.800 align:start position:0%
let me pull that up um I did not see
 
03:14:31.349 --> 03:14:31.359 align:start position:0%
anything that was of concern in fact it
 
03:14:33.469 --> 03:14:33.479 align:start position:0%
was kind of nice to see some of the
 
03:14:35.469 --> 03:14:35.479 align:start position:0%
concerns we had last year kind of
 
03:14:38.030 --> 03:14:38.040 align:start position:0%
written in um page three of
 
03:14:42.469 --> 03:14:42.479 align:start position:0%
that um paragraph B it says understand
 
03:14:43.510 --> 03:14:43.520 align:start position:0%
stands and shall adhere to the
 
03:14:46.389 --> 03:14:46.399 align:start position:0%
obligations of RSA 326 M3 namely nurse
 
03:14:48.110 --> 03:14:48.120 align:start position:0%
agency shall not commit the services of
 
03:14:49.950 --> 03:14:49.960 align:start position:0%
a single nurse or licensed nursing
 
03:14:51.790 --> 03:14:51.800 align:start position:0%
assistant to more than one healthc care
 
03:14:53.670 --> 03:14:53.680 align:start position:0%
facility for the same time period or
 
03:14:55.710 --> 03:14:55.720 align:start position:0%
shift and cancel the commitment to a
 
03:14:57.510 --> 03:14:57.520 align:start position:0%
facility or compel that facility to bid
 
03:14:59.950 --> 03:14:59.960 align:start position:0%
again for services already promised it
 
03:15:01.950 --> 03:15:01.960 align:start position:0%
two nurse agency shall not recruit
 
03:15:03.309 --> 03:15:03.319 align:start position:0%
potential employees on the premises of
 
03:15:05.790 --> 03:15:05.800 align:start position:0%
healthcare facility three nurse agency
 
03:15:07.750 --> 03:15:07.760 align:start position:0%
shall not change a healthcare facility
 
03:15:09.630 --> 03:15:09.640 align:start position:0%
uh charge a healthcare facility a higher
 
03:15:11.269 --> 03:15:11.279 align:start position:0%
amount based upon the presence in that
 
03:15:13.590 --> 03:15:13.600 align:start position:0%
facility of a communicable virus except
 
03:15:14.990 --> 03:15:15.000 align:start position:0%
in the case of a state or local
 
03:15:17.429 --> 03:15:17.439 align:start position:0%
Declaration of a public health emergency
 
03:15:19.150 --> 03:15:19.160 align:start position:0%
and for nurse agencies shall not
 
03:15:20.910 --> 03:15:20.920 align:start position:0%
facilitate the placement of any licensed
 
03:15:22.630 --> 03:15:22.640 align:start position:0%
professional with a license that's been
 
03:15:25.870 --> 03:15:25.880 align:start position:0%
suspended um so I I felt like that hit
 
03:15:27.990 --> 03:15:28.000 align:start position:0%
the intent that we were looking for and
 
03:15:30.510 --> 03:15:30.520 align:start position:0%
then um 4B deals with the 2-year renewal
 
03:15:32.990 --> 03:15:33.000 align:start position:0%
process and um the process following
 
03:15:34.110 --> 03:15:34.120 align:start position:0%
after that it's 12 pages long but
 
03:15:36.070 --> 03:15:36.080 align:start position:0%
following after that is uh dealing with
 
03:15:38.510 --> 03:15:38.520 align:start position:0%
suspended licenses and renewal licenses
 
03:15:41.150 --> 03:15:41.160 align:start position:0%
and all of that stuff so um I didn't see
 
03:15:42.630 --> 03:15:42.640 align:start position:0%
anything personally that raised any red
 
03:15:43.990 --> 03:15:44.000 align:start position:0%
flags it seemed like they followed the
 
03:15:46.950 --> 03:15:46.960 align:start position:0%
intent and um what we had put into the
 
03:15:49.630 --> 03:15:49.640 align:start position:0%
statute uh but uh open for conversation
 
03:15:49.640 --> 03:15:51.870 align:start position:0%
statute uh but uh open for conversation
on

03:15:51.870 --> 03:15:51.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:51.880 --> 03:15:54.070 align:start position:0%
 
it

03:15:54.070 --> 03:15:54.080 align:start position:0%
it
 
03:15:57.150 --> 03:15:57.160 align:start position:0%
okay that's all of the work that I have
 
03:15:59.110 --> 03:15:59.120 align:start position:0%
for today unless anybody has anything
 
03:16:01.750 --> 03:16:01.760 align:start position:0%
else or any other
 
03:16:05.910 --> 03:16:05.920 align:start position:0%
comments Peter sorry representative
 
03:16:10.910 --> 03:16:10.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:13.950 --> 03:16:13.960 align:start position:0%
representative get I get too formal here
 
03:16:16.150 --> 03:16:16.160 align:start position:0%
um anyway
 
03:16:18.910 --> 03:16:18.920 align:start position:0%
so I I have to give you a little bit of
 
03:16:22.750 --> 03:16:22.760 align:start position:0%
a of a tutorial here
 
03:16:25.990 --> 03:16:26.000 align:start position:0%
because as as you probably know rules
 
03:16:29.309 --> 03:16:29.319 align:start position:0%
have the force and effect of law right
 
03:16:30.830 --> 03:16:30.840 align:start position:0%
and this is something which the
 
03:16:34.150 --> 03:16:34.160 align:start position:0%
legislature has agreed to because the
 
03:16:36.830 --> 03:16:36.840 align:start position:0%
legislature is the body of the PO part
 
03:16:40.950 --> 03:16:40.960 align:start position:0%
of government that makes laws right so
 
03:16:43.429 --> 03:16:43.439 align:start position:0%
we have given is this something that has
 
03:16:46.590 --> 03:16:46.600 align:start position:0%
to be on record or can we talk about it
 
03:16:48.670 --> 03:16:48.680 align:start position:0%
afterwards I'm sorry say your question
 
03:16:49.830 --> 03:16:49.840 align:start position:0%
does this have to be on record or can we
 
03:16:51.189 --> 03:16:51.199 align:start position:0%
just talk about it afterwards because I
 
03:16:53.550 --> 03:16:53.560 align:start position:0%
know Jackie's got to go that's fine too
 
03:16:55.349 --> 03:16:55.359 align:start position:0%
okay um at that in that case I'm going
 
03:16:57.830 --> 03:16:57.840 align:start position:0%
to end um the session on the
 
03:16:59.910 --> 03:16:59.920 align:start position:0%
subcommittee over I don't know what is
 
03:17:02.590 --> 03:17:02.600 align:start position:0%
it rules it's not sub rule making okay
 
03:17:04.910 --> 03:17:04.920 align:start position:0%
subcommittee on Ru making and uh we will
 
03:17:06.469 --> 03:17:06.479 align:start position:0%
reconvene after we look at the next
 
03:17:10.429 --> 03:17:10.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:14.950 --> 03:17:14.960 align:start position:0%
you okay so the idea a is that the the
 
03:17:18.670 --> 03:17:18.680 align:start position:0%
legislature gives up a portion of its
 
03:17:24.309 --> 03:17:24.319 align:start position:0%
power to the um to the executive body to
 
03:17:26.150 --> 03:17:26.160 align:start position:0%
make rules which have the force and
 
03:17:28.429 --> 03:17:28.439 align:start position:0%
effect of law which is the prerogative
 
03:17:30.349 --> 03:17:30.359 align:start position:0%
of the legislature
 
03:17:35.389 --> 03:17:35.399 align:start position:0%
right uh we we we do that uh in in in
 
03:17:39.510 --> 03:17:39.520 align:start position:0%
order to have the laws that we make
 
03:17:39.520 --> 03:17:41.189 align:start position:0%
order to have the laws that we make
successfully

03:17:41.189 --> 03:17:41.199 align:start position:0%
successfully
 
03:17:43.870 --> 03:17:43.880 align:start position:0%
implemented successfully implemented
 
03:17:46.070 --> 03:17:46.080 align:start position:0%
right and the method of determining
 
03:17:49.950 --> 03:17:49.960 align:start position:0%
whether the rules are appropriate to
 
03:17:54.870 --> 03:17:54.880 align:start position:0%
implement the statute is that is the
 
03:17:57.790 --> 03:17:57.800 align:start position:0%
task uh and the objective of the Jael
 
03:18:01.670 --> 03:18:01.680 align:start position:0%
car one last one last bite at the Apple
 
03:18:03.550 --> 03:18:03.560 align:start position:0%
because once the rules
 
03:18:05.750 --> 03:18:05.760 align:start position:0%
are are are
 
03:18:09.550 --> 03:18:09.560 align:start position:0%
promulgated by the agency right in
 
03:18:12.990 --> 03:18:13.000 align:start position:0%
collaboration with the practitioners
 
03:18:15.670 --> 03:18:15.680 align:start position:0%
and then they come to the jel car for
 
03:18:15.680 --> 03:18:16.469 align:start position:0%
and then they come to the jel car for
for

03:18:16.469 --> 03:18:16.479 align:start position:0%
for
 
03:18:21.510 --> 03:18:21.520 align:start position:0%
oversight um then uh the gelar has one
 
03:18:24.510 --> 03:18:24.520 align:start position:0%
last bite at the Apple to say do these
 
03:18:27.670 --> 03:18:27.680 align:start position:0%
rules actually implement the statute
 
03:18:30.110 --> 03:18:30.120 align:start position:0%
correctly not exceeding legislative
 
03:18:32.790 --> 03:18:32.800 align:start position:0%
Authority or violating legislative
 
03:18:35.830 --> 03:18:35.840 align:start position:0%
intent th those are the fundamental main
 
03:18:39.550 --> 03:18:39.560 align:start position:0%
pillars of the Jael car um but once a
 
03:18:43.070 --> 03:18:43.080 align:start position:0%
statute has been passed
 
03:18:47.229 --> 03:18:47.239 align:start position:0%
and the jel car has had its uh bite at
 
03:18:49.469 --> 03:18:49.479 align:start position:0%
that Apple
 
03:18:54.990 --> 03:18:55.000 align:start position:0%
then then the legislature has no further
 
03:18:58.269 --> 03:18:58.279 align:start position:0%
oversight because the executive body
 
03:18:59.950 --> 03:18:59.960 align:start position:0%
they're the ones are supposed to carry
 
03:19:01.830 --> 03:19:01.840 align:start position:0%
out the law
 
03:19:05.750 --> 03:19:05.760 align:start position:0%
right the the governor and and and all
 
03:19:07.990 --> 03:19:08.000 align:start position:0%
of his administrative agency PE
 
03:19:09.950 --> 03:19:09.960 align:start position:0%
Personnel right their job is to
 
03:19:13.750 --> 03:19:13.760 align:start position:0%
implement that statute and so to the
 
03:19:16.950 --> 03:19:16.960 align:start position:0%
degree that the that the rule comes
 
03:19:19.269 --> 03:19:19.279 align:start position:0%
back that's why this is important why I
 
03:19:21.510 --> 03:19:21.520 align:start position:0%
mention it's potentially
 
03:19:23.830 --> 03:19:23.840 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional with if the rule comes
 
03:19:28.309 --> 03:19:28.319 align:start position:0%
back to the legislature and is seen by
 
03:19:31.309 --> 03:19:31.319 align:start position:0%
any one of the policy committees now
 
03:19:34.910 --> 03:19:34.920 align:start position:0%
we're Edis we're exercising oversight
 
03:19:39.469 --> 03:19:39.479 align:start position:0%
over the Executive body yeah and that's
 
03:19:42.229 --> 03:19:42.239 align:start position:0%
that's not what we're doing here so we
 
03:19:44.349 --> 03:19:44.359 align:start position:0%
have to be mindful that it's a very
 
03:19:47.070 --> 03:19:47.080 align:start position:0%
delicate thing and to the degree that
 
03:19:49.070 --> 03:19:49.080 align:start position:0%
the that the
 
03:19:54.429 --> 03:19:54.439 align:start position:0%
committee is acting to Pro make
 
03:19:58.269 --> 03:19:58.279 align:start position:0%
pronouncements about that situation then
 
03:20:00.990 --> 03:20:01.000 align:start position:0%
they are doing something that that they
 
03:20:03.990 --> 03:20:04.000 align:start position:0%
have no real authority to do because now
 
03:20:07.990 --> 03:20:08.000 align:start position:0%
one committee is acting on behalf of the
 
03:20:10.229 --> 03:20:10.239 align:start position:0%
legislature and ordinarily it would have
 
03:20:13.150 --> 03:20:13.160 align:start position:0%
to be it have to be approved by the
 
03:20:15.950 --> 03:20:15.960 align:start position:0%
entire house and I think but I think
 
03:20:18.830 --> 03:20:18.840 align:start position:0%
that's I think the intent so one two
 
03:20:23.189 --> 03:20:23.199 align:start position:0%
things uh one we're just watching preil
 
03:20:25.630 --> 03:20:25.640 align:start position:0%
car before it even comes to you to so
 
03:20:27.110 --> 03:20:27.120 align:start position:0%
that we can inform people if they want
 
03:20:28.950 --> 03:20:28.960 align:start position:0%
to go to public testimony so that they
 
03:20:31.870 --> 03:20:31.880 align:start position:0%
can testify that aspect of it I agree
 
03:20:34.189 --> 03:20:34.199 align:start position:0%
with if we're doing it before we're
 
03:20:36.110 --> 03:20:36.120 align:start position:0%
doing it before jail car and then the
 
03:20:38.229 --> 03:20:38.239 align:start position:0%
second part would be part of keeping
 
03:20:39.750 --> 03:20:39.760 align:start position:0%
people trying I believe part of the
 
03:20:41.590 --> 03:20:41.600 align:start position:0%
intent of keeping people involved in the
 
03:20:41.600 --> 03:20:42.710 align:start position:0%
intent of keeping people involved in the
process

03:20:42.710 --> 03:20:42.720 align:start position:0%
process
 
03:20:45.510 --> 03:20:45.520 align:start position:0%
is so that if we feel like the executive
 
03:20:48.429 --> 03:20:48.439 align:start position:0%
brance implements a rule um that goes
 
03:20:50.950 --> 03:20:50.960 align:start position:0%
outside of the scope of the legislative
 
03:20:53.269 --> 03:20:53.279 align:start position:0%
intent I mean we can still correct that
 
03:20:55.030 --> 03:20:55.040 align:start position:0%
with future legislation it would have to
 
03:20:56.269 --> 03:20:56.279 align:start position:0%
go through the whole process but at
 
03:20:58.590 --> 03:20:58.600 align:start position:0%
least we're aware that it's happening so
 
03:21:00.510 --> 03:21:00.520 align:start position:0%
that we can address it with legislation
 
03:21:02.070 --> 03:21:02.080 align:start position:0%
uh I think there was some concern that
 
03:21:03.349 --> 03:21:03.359 align:start position:0%
those things are just kind of falling
 
03:21:05.269 --> 03:21:05.279 align:start position:0%
through the cracks sometimes and not
 
03:21:07.510 --> 03:21:07.520 align:start position:0%
everybody's noticing so they've just as
 
03:21:09.189 --> 03:21:09.199 align:start position:0%
opposed to just having jail car look at
 
03:21:10.750 --> 03:21:10.760 align:start position:0%
at the you know the times that they look
 
03:21:12.870 --> 03:21:12.880 align:start position:0%
at it they've added a another pre-layer
 
03:21:15.389 --> 03:21:15.399 align:start position:0%
to it in all of the policy committees
 
03:21:17.870 --> 03:21:17.880 align:start position:0%
that have interaction with rulle making
 
03:21:19.469 --> 03:21:19.479 align:start position:0%
um so that everybody is watching their
 
03:21:21.830 --> 03:21:21.840 align:start position:0%
own particular group of laws that they
 
03:21:23.590 --> 03:21:23.600 align:start position:0%
put into place and how they're being
 
03:21:25.429 --> 03:21:25.439 align:start position:0%
implemented in rules and then they'll
 
03:21:27.189 --> 03:21:27.199 align:start position:0%
they'll all still after that process
 
03:21:29.510 --> 03:21:29.520 align:start position:0%
they'll all still come to ja car and for
 
03:21:31.030 --> 03:21:31.040 align:start position:0%
those for that part of the process well
 
03:21:33.710 --> 03:21:33.720 align:start position:0%
one of the done one of the concerns has
 
03:21:38.389 --> 03:21:38.399 align:start position:0%
been and this was this was uh enunciated
 
03:21:41.070 --> 03:21:41.080 align:start position:0%
back in the day when when we had you
 
03:21:42.550 --> 03:21:42.560 align:start position:0%
were definitely not on the committee at
 
03:21:45.830 --> 03:21:45.840 align:start position:0%
that point but Tony and the Diane and I
 
03:21:50.269 --> 03:21:50.279 align:start position:0%
were um was that the concern that some
 
03:21:53.150 --> 03:21:53.160 align:start position:0%
of the agencies are being
 
03:21:56.070 --> 03:21:56.080 align:start position:0%
heavy-handed they are they are this is
 
03:21:58.150 --> 03:21:58.160 align:start position:0%
maybe maybe their idea is a good one but
 
03:22:00.510 --> 03:22:00.520 align:start position:0%
there's no legislative Authority for it
 
03:22:02.429 --> 03:22:02.439 align:start position:0%
and they're out there kind of making
 
03:22:05.590 --> 03:22:05.600 align:start position:0%
their making up their own y their own
 
03:22:08.150 --> 03:22:08.160 align:start position:0%
rules uh and I know that Jeff goalie for
 
03:22:10.830 --> 03:22:10.840 align:start position:0%
example was you remember why you don't
 
03:22:12.750 --> 03:22:12.760 align:start position:0%
because you weren't here but Tony and
 
03:22:14.870 --> 03:22:14.880 align:start position:0%
Diana and I will remember with this
 
03:22:16.349 --> 03:22:16.359 align:start position:0%
incident about
 
03:22:19.590 --> 03:22:19.600 align:start position:0%
the the restaurant out
 
03:22:23.389 --> 03:22:23.399 align:start position:0%
in Northwest someplace that had been
 
03:22:27.150 --> 03:22:27.160 align:start position:0%
that had been a it had been I think an
 
03:22:32.990 --> 03:22:33.000 align:start position:0%
ice cream place it was converted into a
 
03:22:40.750 --> 03:22:40.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:40.760 --> 03:22:45.469 align:start position:0%
 
uh

03:22:45.469 --> 03:22:45.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:46.550 --> 03:22:46.560 align:start position:0%
well we're not
 
03:22:48.429 --> 03:22:48.439 align:start position:0%
official yeah we're not official at this
 
03:22:50.950 --> 03:22:50.960 align:start position:0%
point we're just hanging
 
03:22:50.960 --> 03:22:53.070 align:start position:0%
point we're just hanging
out

03:22:53.070 --> 03:22:53.080 align:start position:0%
out
 
03:22:53.080 --> 03:23:01.790 align:start position:0%
out
[Music]

03:23:01.790 --> 03:23:01.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:06.189 --> 03:23:06.199 align:start position:0%
PL well the thing is it it went from
 
03:23:09.630 --> 03:23:09.640 align:start position:0%
being an ice cream place where they were
 
03:23:11.389 --> 03:23:11.399 align:start position:0%
scooping out the ice cream and handing
 
03:23:13.910 --> 03:23:13.920 align:start position:0%
it to the customers it became a Clam
 
03:23:17.469 --> 03:23:17.479 align:start position:0%
Shack now they were largely
 
03:23:22.830 --> 03:23:22.840 align:start position:0%
consuming the product in the restaurant
 
03:23:26.030 --> 03:23:26.040 align:start position:0%
which required more bathrooms all kinds
 
03:23:29.469 --> 03:23:29.479 align:start position:0%
of stuff and you're putting stuff down
 
03:23:31.630 --> 03:23:31.640 align:start position:0%
if you're if you're frying clams you're
 
03:23:33.429 --> 03:23:33.439 align:start position:0%
putting stuff down into the ground
 
03:23:40.670 --> 03:23:40.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:40.680 --> 03:23:52.830 align:start position:0%
 
environment

03:23:52.830 --> 03:23:52.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:54.750 --> 03:23:54.760 align:start position:0%
I think I think you could but anyway the
 
03:23:58.469 --> 03:23:58.479 align:start position:0%
idea was that they they prescribed a
 
03:24:01.110 --> 03:24:01.120 align:start position:0%
mammoth 1,000
 
03:24:05.550 --> 03:24:05.560 align:start position:0%
gallon grease trap grease trap which was
 
03:24:08.229 --> 03:24:08.239 align:start position:0%
way too big way way way bigger than
 
03:24:10.630 --> 03:24:10.640 align:start position:0%
necessary and so forth uh I have heard
 
03:24:11.620 --> 03:24:11.630 align:start position:0%
about the gree trap
 
03:24:11.630 --> 03:24:13.469 align:start position:0%
about the gree trap
[Laughter]

03:24:13.469 --> 03:24:13.479 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
03:24:26.060 --> 03:24:26.070 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:26.070 --> 03:24:29.429 align:start position:0%
 
[Laughter]

03:24:29.429 --> 03:24:29.439 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
03:24:29.439 --> 03:24:31.830 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
yeah

03:24:31.830 --> 03:24:31.840 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
03:24:34.710 --> 03:24:34.720 align:start position:0%
ini they
 
03:24:36.790 --> 03:24:36.800 align:start position:0%
ended the
 
03:24:36.800 --> 03:24:39.229 align:start position:0%
ended the
building

03:24:39.229 --> 03:24:39.239 align:start position:0%
building
 
03:24:42.790 --> 03:24:42.800 align:start position:0%
ands agreed to get together
 
03:24:46.550 --> 03:24:46.560 align:start position:0%
and um come come up with some solution
 
03:24:49.150 --> 03:24:49.160 align:start position:0%
problem and they did and they and they
 
03:24:50.870 --> 03:24:50.880 align:start position:0%
proposed some stuff I had some comments
 
03:24:50.880 --> 03:24:51.750 align:start position:0%
proposed some stuff I had some comments
on

03:24:51.750 --> 03:24:51.760 align:start position:0%
on
 
03:24:55.630 --> 03:24:55.640 align:start position:0%
it work they fin came changing R
 
03:24:55.640 --> 03:24:57.990 align:start position:0%
it work they fin came changing R
making

03:24:57.990 --> 03:24:58.000 align:start position:0%
making
 
03:24:58.000 --> 03:25:01.429 align:start position:0%
making
and

03:25:01.429 --> 03:25:01.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:04.870 --> 03:25:04.880 align:start position:0%
trainings and they actually I think
 
03:25:08.309 --> 03:25:08.319 align:start position:0%
right thing and that place could have
 
03:25:17.830 --> 03:25:17.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:21.550 --> 03:25:21.560 align:start position:0%
under yeah that's a huge greas
 
03:25:28.349 --> 03:25:28.359 align:start position:0%
