00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:26.720 align:start position:0%
introduction in several other State
 
00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:29.200 align:start position:0%
Legislative CH Chambers now therefore
 
00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:32.680 align:start position:0%
let it be resolved by the House of
 
00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:34.040 align:start position:0%
Representatives that the New Hampshire
 
00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:35.840 align:start position:0%
legislature reaffirms its ratification
 
00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:37.200 align:start position:0%
of the child labor Amendment to the
 
00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:41.080 align:start position:0%
United States Constitution um so yeah
 
00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:45.760 align:start position:0%
among the um other state legislature
 
00:03:48.229 --> 00:03:48.239 align:start position:0%
Chambers legislative Chambers mentioned
 
00:03:51.589 --> 00:03:51.599 align:start position:0%
um the one that this resolution is act
 
00:03:55.309 --> 00:03:55.319 align:start position:0%
is based off of is Minnesota since um
 
00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:58.680 align:start position:0%
Minnesota Minnesota passed a uh similar
 
00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:04.040 align:start position:0%
resolution um so yeah um the this
 
00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:05.560 align:start position:0%
amendment to the
 
00:04:08.869 --> 00:04:08.879 align:start position:0%
Constitution has already been uh
 
00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:12.680 align:start position:0%
ratified by the majority of States but
 
00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:15.720 align:start position:0%
um not quite the number
 
00:04:19.349 --> 00:04:19.359 align:start position:0%
necessary to actually be adopted since
 
00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:23.040 align:start position:0%
you know there's that um there's that
 
00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:26.880 align:start position:0%
requirement that I I forget um the exact
 
00:04:30.189 --> 00:04:30.199 align:start position:0%
number but it it's like 2/3 or 3/4s
 
00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:33.360 align:start position:0%
or something um that so we haven't quite
 
00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:35.080 align:start position:0%
reached the threshold for full
 
00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:39.600 align:start position:0%
ratification yet um and
 
00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:42.360 align:start position:0%
um the thing is the amendment didn't
 
00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:44.720 align:start position:0%
come with any sort of expiration date on
 
00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:47.520 align:start position:0%
it and neither do our
 
00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:49.880 align:start position:0%
ratifications so our previous
 
00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:53.160 align:start position:0%
ratification is still valid um and there
 
00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:54.600 align:start position:0%
is still time for additional
 
00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:56.680 align:start position:0%
ratifications you'll you you'll see the
 
00:04:58.830 --> 00:04:58.840 align:start position:0%
same thing happened with the most recent
 
00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:01.720 align:start position:0%
Amendment to the Constitution the um
 
00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:03.840 align:start position:0%
27th Amendment which had been around
 
00:05:05.029 --> 00:05:05.039 align:start position:0%
since the
 
00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:08.800 align:start position:0%
1700s and um people's old ra States old
 
00:05:10.909 --> 00:05:10.919 align:start position:0%
ratifications were found to still be
 
00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:17.360 align:start position:0%
valid and um then led to a renewed
 
00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:19.160 align:start position:0%
interest in it
 
00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:20.670 align:start position:0%
interest in it
um

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:20.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:23.560 align:start position:0%
and ratification
 
00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:26.080 align:start position:0%
um yeah
 
00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:32.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:36.440 align:start position:0%
so um if if you look at
 
00:05:40.189 --> 00:05:40.199 align:start position:0%
the if you look at the map of states
 
00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:43.160 align:start position:0%
that have ratified the child labor
 
00:05:46.909 --> 00:05:46.919 align:start position:0%
Amendment um
 
00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:49.600 align:start position:0%
so you know here in the New Hampshire
 
00:05:51.469 --> 00:05:51.479 align:start position:0%
legislature we often like to say oh
 
00:05:54.309 --> 00:05:54.319 align:start position:0%
we're not like our neighboring states um
 
00:05:57.909 --> 00:05:57.919 align:start position:0%
so yeah that's true in this case too um
 
00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:01.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:04.909 --> 00:06:04.919 align:start position:0%
um the the majority of uh other New
 
00:06:04.919 --> 00:06:05.950 align:start position:0%
um the the majority of uh other New
England

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:05.960 align:start position:0%
England
 
00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:10.800 align:start position:0%
states have actually um not ratified it
 
00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:13.680 align:start position:0%
yet um it it's just New Hampshire and
 
00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:15.240 align:start position:0%
Maine are the only two New England
 
00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:17.680 align:start position:0%
states that have ratified it but Vermont
 
00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:20.080 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts Rhode Island Connecticut
 
00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:22.280 align:start position:0%
and New York have not ratified it yet
 
00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:24.840 align:start position:0%
though which is kind
 
00:06:28.749 --> 00:06:28.759 align:start position:0%
of the opposite um from what you'd
 
00:06:32.589 --> 00:06:32.599 align:start position:0%
expect based on um modern
 
00:06:36.469 --> 00:06:36.479 align:start position:0%
political uh Coalition breakdowns but um
 
00:06:37.950 --> 00:06:37.960 align:start position:0%
yeah it just kind of goes to show you
 
00:06:40.230 --> 00:06:40.240 align:start position:0%
how political coalitions change over
 
00:06:44.629 --> 00:06:44.639 align:start position:0%
time and so I think um I think the fact
 
00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:48.000 align:start position:0%
that we did this in the past is um a
 
00:06:51.749 --> 00:06:51.759 align:start position:0%
Good Thing Worth recognizing um
 
00:06:55.189 --> 00:06:55.199 align:start position:0%
especially since yeah we the reason it
 
00:06:59.150 --> 00:06:59.160 align:start position:0%
says um in the resolution that there's
 
00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:01.280 align:start position:0%
been renewed interest in ratification of
 
00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:03.840 align:start position:0%
it is because more states have been
 
00:07:07.189 --> 00:07:07.199 align:start position:0%
trying to legalize child labor and I
 
00:07:12.469 --> 00:07:12.479 align:start position:0%
think that's bad and that um we should
 
00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:15.840 align:start position:0%
allow we should allow Congress to pass
 
00:07:21.909 --> 00:07:21.919 align:start position:0%
legislation about it um so yeah this
 
00:07:23.909 --> 00:07:23.919 align:start position:0%
resolution uh
 
00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:26.440 align:start position:0%
basically signal support for it and
 
00:07:29.029 --> 00:07:29.039 align:start position:0%
hopefully some of our neighboring states
 
00:07:32.510 --> 00:07:32.520 align:start position:0%
will notice and
 
00:07:34.589 --> 00:07:34.599 align:start position:0%
um will
 
00:07:37.110 --> 00:07:37.120 align:start position:0%
then get around
 
00:07:40.270 --> 00:07:40.280 align:start position:0%
to signing their own ratifications to it
 
00:07:44.189 --> 00:07:44.199 align:start position:0%
so we can um finally get this amendment
 
00:07:46.029 --> 00:07:46.039 align:start position:0%
to the Constitution
 
00:07:50.270 --> 00:07:50.280 align:start position:0%
pass uh so thanks and I'll take
 
00:07:55.309 --> 00:07:55.319 align:start position:0%
questions uh I have uh one question uh
 
00:07:57.390 --> 00:07:57.400 align:start position:0%
representative Gallagher you your
 
00:07:59.990 --> 00:08:00.000 align:start position:0%
resolution states that the last state to
 
00:08:02.790 --> 00:08:02.800 align:start position:0%
ratify this amendment was in 1937 is
 
00:08:14.350 --> 00:08:14.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:17.589 --> 00:08:17.599 align:start position:0%
correctly sorry let um let me just find
 
00:08:20.510 --> 00:08:20.520 align:start position:0%
what that was that was that was can
 
00:08:25.070 --> 00:08:25.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:27.510 --> 00:08:27.520 align:start position:0%
1937 and this amendment is still short
 
00:08:31.070 --> 00:08:31.080 align:start position:0%
of the 38 necessary yeah
 
00:08:34.870 --> 00:08:34.880 align:start position:0%
um do do you 28 states have ratified it
 
00:08:38.230 --> 00:08:38.240 align:start position:0%
so far so so my question is my
 
00:08:40.430 --> 00:08:40.440 align:start position:0%
understanding of amendment ratification
 
00:08:44.630 --> 00:08:44.640 align:start position:0%
is that there's a seven-year window uh
 
00:08:46.430 --> 00:08:46.440 align:start position:0%
where for example the Equal Rights
 
00:08:49.829 --> 00:08:49.839 align:start position:0%
Amendment in the 70s got to 35 and then
 
00:08:53.070 --> 00:08:53.080 align:start position:0%
after seven years they didn't get to 38
 
00:08:56.150 --> 00:08:56.160 align:start position:0%
but they there was an extension granted
 
00:08:59.829 --> 00:08:59.839 align:start position:0%
uh so my my my question is it's long
 
00:09:05.430 --> 00:09:05.440 align:start position:0%
it's been uh so many years uh it
 
00:09:09.710 --> 00:09:09.720 align:start position:0%
can can a state still we and we've
 
00:09:12.790 --> 00:09:12.800 align:start position:0%
already uh according to your resolution
 
00:09:15.990 --> 00:09:16.000 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire was already ratified the
 
00:09:18.389 --> 00:09:18.399 align:start position:0%
child labor
 
00:09:21.829 --> 00:09:21.839 align:start position:0%
Amendment um so yeah the Equal Rights
 
00:09:25.790 --> 00:09:25.800 align:start position:0%
Amendment was unique in that it included
 
00:09:28.910 --> 00:09:28.920 align:start position:0%
a deadline for ratification which is
 
00:09:30.190 --> 00:09:30.200 align:start position:0%
something something that most other
 
00:09:33.110 --> 00:09:33.120 align:start position:0%
Constitutional Amendments have not
 
00:09:36.590 --> 00:09:36.600 align:start position:0%
included so yeah an amendment has to
 
00:09:38.829 --> 00:09:38.839 align:start position:0%
specify explicitly whether or not it's
 
00:09:40.630 --> 00:09:40.640 align:start position:0%
going to have a deadline attached to it
 
00:09:42.350 --> 00:09:42.360 align:start position:0%
and the child labor Amendment did not
 
00:09:46.150 --> 00:09:46.160 align:start position:0%
have such um a a deadline attached to it
 
00:09:49.829 --> 00:09:49.839 align:start position:0%
so yeah again I'd point you to the 27th
 
00:09:52.310 --> 00:09:52.320 align:start position:0%
Amendment um the one saying that no
 
00:09:55.670 --> 00:09:55.680 align:start position:0%
variation and Congressional pay shall
 
00:09:59.190 --> 00:09:59.200 align:start position:0%
take effect until after there's been um
 
00:10:02.230 --> 00:10:02.240 align:start position:0%
a new election of Representatives the
 
00:10:04.590 --> 00:10:04.600 align:start position:0%
first ratification for that was in
 
00:10:07.230 --> 00:10:07.240 align:start position:0%
1789 and then the last ratification for
 
00:10:08.389 --> 00:10:08.399 align:start position:0%
that was in
 
00:10:11.670 --> 00:10:11.680 align:start position:0%
1992 so yeah again that's a period of
 
00:10:15.949 --> 00:10:15.959 align:start position:0%
over 200 years so this sort of I I think
 
00:10:19.790 --> 00:10:19.800 align:start position:0%
um a 90-year gap is a lot less than that
 
00:10:24.190 --> 00:10:24.200 align:start position:0%
and um so yeah it wouldn't be quite as
 
00:10:27.670 --> 00:10:27.680 align:start position:0%
extreme of a case as with the 27th
 
00:10:29.389 --> 00:10:29.399 align:start position:0%
Amendment okay thank you thank you for
 
00:10:33.790 --> 00:10:33.800 align:start position:0%
that any other questions uh
 
00:10:35.550 --> 00:10:35.560 align:start position:0%
representative thank you for taking my
 
00:10:37.430 --> 00:10:37.440 align:start position:0%
question this is a genuine legal
 
00:10:39.150 --> 00:10:39.160 align:start position:0%
question that I don't know the answer to
 
00:10:40.829 --> 00:10:40.839 align:start position:0%
and perhaps either another member of the
 
00:10:43.990 --> 00:10:44.000 align:start position:0%
committee somebody here may know if we
 
00:10:47.350 --> 00:10:47.360 align:start position:0%
were to reject this as an itl would that
 
00:10:49.430 --> 00:10:49.440 align:start position:0%
serve as a recision of the state's
 
00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:51.110 align:start position:0%
serve as a recision of the state's
previous

00:10:51.110 --> 00:10:51.120 align:start position:0%
previous
 
00:10:54.110 --> 00:10:54.120 align:start position:0%
uh ratifica or ratification of the
 
00:10:58.030 --> 00:10:58.040 align:start position:0%
amendment no um yeah I I was my my
 
00:10:59.870 --> 00:10:59.880 align:start position:0%
understanding is that it would would not
 
00:11:02.670 --> 00:11:02.680 align:start position:0%
um and that
 
00:11:06.030 --> 00:11:06.040 align:start position:0%
um yeah cuz there are there are other
 
00:11:07.430 --> 00:11:07.440 align:start position:0%
states that
 
00:11:13.710 --> 00:11:13.720 align:start position:0%
have um since um failed to pass
 
00:11:16.590 --> 00:11:16.600 align:start position:0%
resolutions like this one um but are
 
00:11:20.310 --> 00:11:20.320 align:start position:0%
still listed as having ratified it um so
 
00:11:22.230 --> 00:11:22.240 align:start position:0%
yeah I think
 
00:11:25.389 --> 00:11:25.399 align:start position:0%
um so yeah we're still going to have
 
00:11:28.470 --> 00:11:28.480 align:start position:0%
ratified it either way the main point um
 
00:11:30.750 --> 00:11:30.760 align:start position:0%
in passing this resolution now is just
 
00:11:33.030 --> 00:11:33.040 align:start position:0%
to show that we're still interested in
 
00:11:36.190 --> 00:11:36.200 align:start position:0%
it and yeah basically to reaffirm our
 
00:11:39.110 --> 00:11:39.120 align:start position:0%
previous support of it as it says to
 
00:11:43.670 --> 00:11:43.680 align:start position:0%
um try to inspire other states to uh
 
00:11:48.069 --> 00:11:48.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:50.470 --> 00:11:50.480 align:start position:0%
it thank you representative Philo this
 
00:11:52.190 --> 00:11:52.200 align:start position:0%
interesting question as representative
 
00:11:54.350 --> 00:11:54.360 align:start position:0%
shortliffe shook his head and this is a
 
00:11:56.310 --> 00:11:56.320 align:start position:0%
resolution and this would whatever
 
00:11:59.829 --> 00:11:59.839 align:start position:0%
happens here would not impact our that's
 
00:12:01.590 --> 00:12:01.600 align:start position:0%
was my understanding to interesting
 
00:12:03.710 --> 00:12:03.720 align:start position:0%
question any other
 
00:12:06.230 --> 00:12:06.240 align:start position:0%
questions San thank you representative
 
00:12:07.629 --> 00:12:07.639 align:start position:0%
Gallagher Prime
 
00:12:09.949 --> 00:12:09.959 align:start position:0%
sponsor okay and I think my uh
 
00:12:12.829 --> 00:12:12.839 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor representative Reed uh will
 
00:12:16.470 --> 00:12:16.480 align:start position:0%
now be presenting next you say hopefully
 
00:12:18.750 --> 00:12:18.760 align:start position:0%
but without a pink card there is no she
 
00:12:27.870 --> 00:12:27.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:38.430 align:start position:0%
 
now

00:12:38.430 --> 00:12:38.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:40.629 --> 00:12:40.639 align:start position:0%
have I been recognized Mr chair uh not
 
00:12:43.910 --> 00:12:43.920 align:start position:0%
yet uh there is a pink card on the way
 
00:12:46.670 --> 00:12:46.680 align:start position:0%
it's not we're very strict about such
 
00:12:49.230 --> 00:12:49.240 align:start position:0%
things in filled out I should have done
 
00:12:52.269 --> 00:12:52.279 align:start position:0%
it for her I just I planned on finishing
 
00:12:54.590 --> 00:12:54.600 align:start position:0%
it after I I don't I only have like one
 
00:12:57.949 --> 00:12:57.959 align:start position:0%
minute which is uh yes okay I see a pink
 
00:12:59.590 --> 00:12:59.600 align:start position:0%
card in the way uh welcome
 
00:13:01.629 --> 00:13:01.639 align:start position:0%
representative uh representative Reed
 
00:13:04.550 --> 00:13:04.560 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor co-sponsor yes thank you Mr
 
00:13:07.470 --> 00:13:07.480 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you honorable members um
 
00:13:11.189 --> 00:13:11.199 align:start position:0%
so I just uh am not here so much on a
 
00:13:12.710 --> 00:13:12.720 align:start position:0%
technical side but I'm happy to try to
 
00:13:15.750 --> 00:13:15.760 align:start position:0%
answer technical questions except to say
 
00:13:19.829 --> 00:13:19.839 align:start position:0%
that uh my general support and I I feel
 
00:13:23.310 --> 00:13:23.320 align:start position:0%
like I shouldn't have to say in the year
 
00:13:27.550 --> 00:13:27.560 align:start position:0%
2024 that child labor is bad that
 
00:13:29.629 --> 00:13:29.639 align:start position:0%
children are human beings beings and
 
00:13:33.790 --> 00:13:33.800 align:start position:0%
child children's rights are human rights
 
00:13:37.350 --> 00:13:37.360 align:start position:0%
and um I really hope that we continue to
 
00:13:39.790 --> 00:13:39.800 align:start position:0%
support what we have supported in the
 
00:13:42.910 --> 00:13:42.920 align:start position:0%
distant past getting rid of child labor
 
00:13:45.269 --> 00:13:45.279 align:start position:0%
um because it would be a shame to
 
00:13:48.110 --> 00:13:48.120 align:start position:0%
recognize fewer human rights as we
 
00:13:51.269 --> 00:13:51.279 align:start position:0%
evolve through our um our overall Arc of
 
00:13:53.990 --> 00:13:54.000 align:start position:0%
society than we've recognized in the
 
00:13:56.389 --> 00:13:56.399 align:start position:0%
past I hope that we we aren't going
 
00:13:59.269 --> 00:13:59.279 align:start position:0%
backwards so I am fully in support um it
 
00:14:03.389 --> 00:14:03.399 align:start position:0%
is true that it does not um resend our
 
00:14:06.590 --> 00:14:06.600 align:start position:0%
previous uh ratification if this sort to
 
00:14:09.470 --> 00:14:09.480 align:start position:0%
fail it's just a resolution that
 
00:14:12.110 --> 00:14:12.120 align:start position:0%
reaffirms our support and that's really
 
00:14:13.430 --> 00:14:13.440 align:start position:0%
all I
 
00:14:17.550 --> 00:14:17.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:20.389 --> 00:14:20.399 align:start position:0%
questions uh seeing none uh thank you
 
00:14:25.310 --> 00:14:25.320 align:start position:0%
for that seeing no other pink cards at
 
00:14:29.749 --> 00:14:29.759 align:start position:0%
this time uh we will close this hearing
 
00:14:32.030 --> 00:14:32.040 align:start position:0%
a minute early that gives us a minute to
 
00:14:34.990 --> 00:14:35.000 align:start position:0%
prep for uh the next measure which uh
 
00:14:57.670 --> 00:14:57.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:57.680 --> 00:15:27.590 align:start position:0%
 
for

00:15:27.590 --> 00:15:27.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:41.949 align:start position:0%
 
probably

00:15:41.949 --> 00:15:41.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:44.309 --> 00:15:44.319 align:start position:0%
okay being uh of time like to open up
 
00:15:46.269 --> 00:15:46.279 align:start position:0%
the hearing on
 
00:15:48.790 --> 00:15:48.800 align:start position:0%
hr19 first person I like to call would
 
00:15:55.949 --> 00:15:55.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:00.189 --> 00:16:00.199 align:start position:0%
Moffett thank you Mr chair hr19 Jones
 
00:16:03.030 --> 00:16:03.040 align:start position:0%
act uh I'm going to repre some of the
 
00:16:06.350 --> 00:16:06.360 align:start position:0%
arguments put forth several years ago by
 
00:16:09.150 --> 00:16:09.160 align:start position:0%
uh gentleman named Brian Riley uh who
 
00:16:11.670 --> 00:16:11.680 align:start position:0%
worked at the KO Institute and spent a
 
00:16:13.749 --> 00:16:13.759 align:start position:0%
lot of time on the Jones act so the
 
00:16:16.309 --> 00:16:16.319 align:start position:0%
Jones act uh is Shand for the Merchant
 
00:16:20.389 --> 00:16:20.399 align:start position:0%
Marine Act of 1920 passed over a century
 
00:16:25.269 --> 00:16:25.279 align:start position:0%
ago uh and Mr Riley thought that this
 
00:16:27.910 --> 00:16:27.920 align:start position:0%
provides a lesson on how economic
 
00:16:29.910 --> 00:16:29.920 align:start position:0%
controls can can
 
00:16:32.509 --> 00:16:32.519 align:start position:0%
backfire so the Jones Act is described
 
00:16:34.350 --> 00:16:34.360 align:start position:0%
by the US Department of Homeland
 
00:16:37.990 --> 00:16:38.000 align:start position:0%
Security as a protectionist policy
 
00:16:40.790 --> 00:16:40.800 align:start position:0%
intended to intended to protect and
 
00:16:42.910 --> 00:16:42.920 align:start position:0%
develop the American Merchant Marine and
 
00:16:45.870 --> 00:16:45.880 align:start position:0%
US ship building now protectionist
 
00:16:47.670 --> 00:16:47.680 align:start position:0%
elements of the Jones act include
 
00:16:49.949 --> 00:16:49.959 align:start position:0%
requirements that ships transporting
 
00:16:52.509 --> 00:16:52.519 align:start position:0%
goods within the United States must be
 
00:16:55.870 --> 00:16:55.880 align:start position:0%
us crewed us owned and US built that's
 
00:16:56.949 --> 00:16:56.959 align:start position:0%
in the
 
00:16:59.189 --> 00:16:59.199 align:start position:0%
law and
 
00:17:01.829 --> 00:17:01.839 align:start position:0%
Mr Riley and others think that these
 
00:17:04.390 --> 00:17:04.400 align:start position:0%
Provisions are not only un unnecessary
 
00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:05.669 align:start position:0%
Provisions are not only un unnecessary
but

00:17:05.669 --> 00:17:05.679 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:17:07.710 --> 00:17:07.720 align:start position:0%
counterproductive so the Jones act
 
00:17:09.630 --> 00:17:09.640 align:start position:0%
Defenders and and you'll hear from some
 
00:17:11.669 --> 00:17:11.679 align:start position:0%
of these folks later uh they alleged
 
00:17:14.549 --> 00:17:14.559 align:start position:0%
that requiring the use of us Crews for
 
00:17:17.390 --> 00:17:17.400 align:start position:0%
demestic shipping protects Americans
 
00:17:20.069 --> 00:17:20.079 align:start position:0%
against foreign terrorists and spies
 
00:17:22.189 --> 00:17:22.199 align:start position:0%
freely traversing the Mississippi River
 
00:17:25.429 --> 00:17:25.439 align:start position:0%
for example disguised as ship
 
00:17:29.190 --> 00:17:29.200 align:start position:0%
operators uh and I think that's largely
 
00:17:31.590 --> 00:17:31.600 align:start position:0%
a scare tactic because with or without
 
00:17:33.909 --> 00:17:33.919 align:start position:0%
the Jones act it's illegal for someone
 
00:17:36.789 --> 00:17:36.799 align:start position:0%
to work in the US without a permanent
 
00:17:40.110 --> 00:17:40.120 align:start position:0%
resident card or a work permit uh or an
 
00:17:43.270 --> 00:17:43.280 align:start position:0%
employment related visa and this is true
 
00:17:45.110 --> 00:17:45.120 align:start position:0%
whether they're transporting merchandise
 
00:17:48.750 --> 00:17:48.760 align:start position:0%
between us ports or or doing any other
 
00:17:52.110 --> 00:17:52.120 align:start position:0%
job so the Jones act requirement that
 
00:17:54.549 --> 00:17:54.559 align:start position:0%
ships transporting goods between
 
00:17:57.390 --> 00:17:57.400 align:start position:0%
domestic ports must be us-owned
 
00:18:00.350 --> 00:18:00.360 align:start position:0%
deprives the industry of beneficial
 
00:18:00.360 --> 00:18:01.870 align:start position:0%
deprives the industry of beneficial
foreign

00:18:01.870 --> 00:18:01.880 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
00:18:04.390 --> 00:18:04.400 align:start position:0%
investment areas of the economy that are
 
00:18:06.830 --> 00:18:06.840 align:start position:0%
open to foreign investment account for
 
00:18:09.870 --> 00:18:09.880 align:start position:0%
over 7 million us jobs and other
 
00:18:12.310 --> 00:18:12.320 align:start position:0%
analysts have pointed out uh that
 
00:18:14.510 --> 00:18:14.520 align:start position:0%
removing ownership limits would provide
 
00:18:16.350 --> 00:18:16.360 align:start position:0%
more opportunities for Americans
 
00:18:18.830 --> 00:18:18.840 align:start position:0%
involved in domestic waterborne
 
00:18:22.789 --> 00:18:22.799 align:start position:0%
transportation to also benefit from uh
 
00:18:25.270 --> 00:18:25.280 align:start position:0%
job creating foreign
 
00:18:27.390 --> 00:18:27.400 align:start position:0%
investment and as with foreign
 
00:18:30.070 --> 00:18:30.080 align:start position:0%
investment in other Industries besides
 
00:18:33.149 --> 00:18:33.159 align:start position:0%
shipping ownership of vessels providing
 
00:18:35.669 --> 00:18:35.679 align:start position:0%
waterborne Transportation would be
 
00:18:38.270 --> 00:18:38.280 align:start position:0%
screened by the committee on foreign
 
00:18:41.590 --> 00:18:41.600 align:start position:0%
investment uh which is cfius to mitigate
 
00:18:44.470 --> 00:18:44.480 align:start position:0%
any national security risk so the so the
 
00:18:46.630 --> 00:18:46.640 align:start position:0%
National Security argument I think is is
 
00:18:50.310 --> 00:18:50.320 align:start position:0%
minimal if if it exists at all it's also
 
00:18:53.270 --> 00:18:53.280 align:start position:0%
been argued that the modern ownership
 
00:18:55.990 --> 00:18:56.000 align:start position:0%
Arrangements render the Jones act
 
00:18:58.950 --> 00:18:58.960 align:start position:0%
ownership requirement being American to
 
00:18:58.960 --> 00:19:00.029 align:start position:0%
ownership requirement being American to
be

00:19:00.029 --> 00:19:00.039 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:19:02.549 --> 00:19:02.559 align:start position:0%
obsolete but the the most criticized
 
00:19:05.830 --> 00:19:05.840 align:start position:0%
element of the Jones act has been its
 
00:19:08.310 --> 00:19:08.320 align:start position:0%
ban on the use of foreign built ships
 
00:19:11.310 --> 00:19:11.320 align:start position:0%
for domestic shipping now this is unique
 
00:19:12.510 --> 00:19:12.520 align:start position:0%
in terms of
 
00:19:15.950 --> 00:19:15.960 align:start position:0%
regulation for example no similar
 
00:19:17.950 --> 00:19:17.960 align:start position:0%
restrictions apply to domestic
 
00:19:20.630 --> 00:19:20.640 align:start position:0%
transportation of merchandise by air
 
00:19:23.990 --> 00:19:24.000 align:start position:0%
rail or truck so you can have uh trucks
 
00:19:25.870 --> 00:19:25.880 align:start position:0%
that are built in other countries and we
 
00:19:28.710 --> 00:19:28.720 align:start position:0%
do move stuff around you can have
 
00:19:31.190 --> 00:19:31.200 align:start position:0%
aircraft to a lesser extent from other
 
00:19:33.230 --> 00:19:33.240 align:start position:0%
countries moving stuff around but we
 
00:19:35.669 --> 00:19:35.679 align:start position:0%
can't have ships that are built in other
 
00:19:39.149 --> 00:19:39.159 align:start position:0%
countries moving stuff around in this
 
00:19:42.830 --> 00:19:42.840 align:start position:0%
country uh in according to a 2017
 
00:19:45.029 --> 00:19:45.039 align:start position:0%
Congressional research service report
 
00:19:47.590 --> 00:19:47.600 align:start position:0%
Coastal siiz container ships built in
 
00:19:50.270 --> 00:19:50.280 align:start position:0%
the United States cost six to eight
 
00:19:52.630 --> 00:19:52.640 align:start position:0%
times more than comparable foreign built
 
00:19:54.789 --> 00:19:54.799 align:start position:0%
ships so we're having a real tough time
 
00:19:56.710 --> 00:19:56.720 align:start position:0%
building ships in this country the ships
 
00:19:59.029 --> 00:19:59.039 align:start position:0%
the few ships that we now build build
 
00:20:02.070 --> 00:20:02.080 align:start position:0%
cost way more than ships that are out
 
00:20:04.710 --> 00:20:04.720 align:start position:0%
there from other countries but we can't
 
00:20:06.750 --> 00:20:06.760 align:start position:0%
we have to use these expensive ships
 
00:20:09.070 --> 00:20:09.080 align:start position:0%
that we're not building
 
00:20:11.029 --> 00:20:11.039 align:start position:0%
anymore and this is something that needs
 
00:20:13.350 --> 00:20:13.360 align:start position:0%
attention that's why this this measure
 
00:20:15.350 --> 00:20:15.360 align:start position:0%
we're hearing this measure today so the
 
00:20:17.630 --> 00:20:17.640 align:start position:0%
the argument made by proponents of the
 
00:20:20.549 --> 00:20:20.559 align:start position:0%
Jones act back in 1920 and and you'll
 
00:20:23.390 --> 00:20:23.400 align:start position:0%
hear some today I'm sure the argument
 
00:20:25.230 --> 00:20:25.240 align:start position:0%
for the Jones Act is simple the United
 
00:20:27.029 --> 00:20:27.039 align:start position:0%
States needs a strong ship building
 
00:20:28.630 --> 00:20:28.640 align:start position:0%
industry and the way to real Iz this
 
00:20:30.750 --> 00:20:30.760 align:start position:0%
goal is by freeing it of the obligation
 
00:20:30.760 --> 00:20:31.990 align:start position:0%
goal is by freeing it of the obligation
to

00:20:31.990 --> 00:20:32.000 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:20:35.630 --> 00:20:35.640 align:start position:0%
compete it's it's it's a it's like a
 
00:20:38.470 --> 00:20:38.480 align:start position:0%
tariff but High tariffs don't
 
00:20:40.870 --> 00:20:40.880 align:start position:0%
necessarily make Industries stronger
 
00:20:43.470 --> 00:20:43.480 align:start position:0%
they actually can make them weaker by
 
00:20:46.430 --> 00:20:46.440 align:start position:0%
reducing competition the Jones act
 
00:20:48.549 --> 00:20:48.559 align:start position:0%
reduces the incentive for US ship
 
00:20:50.630 --> 00:20:50.640 align:start position:0%
Builders to
 
00:20:54.110 --> 00:20:54.120 align:start position:0%
innovate take cars for example foreign
 
00:20:58.390 --> 00:20:58.400 align:start position:0%
car competition for example has prompted
 
00:21:01.270 --> 00:21:01.280 align:start position:0%
I believe many of us believe that this
 
00:21:03.710 --> 00:21:03.720 align:start position:0%
competition is has been good for
 
00:21:06.750 --> 00:21:06.760 align:start position:0%
American car manufacturers the fact that
 
00:21:10.630 --> 00:21:10.640 align:start position:0%
somebody could buy a Toyota years ago or
 
00:21:16.549 --> 00:21:16.559 align:start position:0%
or today um makes Ford or GM uh it
 
00:21:20.029 --> 00:21:20.039 align:start position:0%
pressures them to to do better if if you
 
00:21:21.990 --> 00:21:22.000 align:start position:0%
couldn't buy a foreign
 
00:21:25.390 --> 00:21:25.400 align:start position:0%
car like you can't use a foreign ship
 
00:21:29.669 --> 00:21:29.679 align:start position:0%
then the the uh the the car makers
 
00:21:31.990 --> 00:21:32.000 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have the same pressures to to
 
00:21:34.269 --> 00:21:34.279 align:start position:0%
perform or or for
 
00:21:36.630 --> 00:21:36.640 align:start position:0%
excellence so I think I think you get my
 
00:21:38.070 --> 00:21:38.080 align:start position:0%
point there so according to the US
 
00:21:39.630 --> 00:21:39.640 align:start position:0%
Maritime Administration the United
 
00:21:41.750 --> 00:21:41.760 align:start position:0%
States non-defense oceangoing vessel
 
00:21:44.630 --> 00:21:44.640 align:start position:0%
fleet has declined from 193 ships in
 
00:21:48.430 --> 00:21:48.440 align:start position:0%
2000 to 96 as of 2018 it's probably less
 
00:21:51.710 --> 00:21:51.720 align:start position:0%
than that now in our Navy and again this
 
00:21:54.590 --> 00:21:54.600 align:start position:0%
is veterans committee our Navy is down
 
00:21:58.990 --> 00:21:59.000 align:start position:0%
to about 280 ships China is pushing 500
 
00:22:01.990 --> 00:22:02.000 align:start position:0%
ships our ship building industry is in
 
00:22:04.669 --> 00:22:04.679 align:start position:0%
in crisis I think many of us think and
 
00:22:07.510 --> 00:22:07.520 align:start position:0%
the Jones act this protectionist Jones
 
00:22:10.470 --> 00:22:10.480 align:start position:0%
Act is is impacting uh ship building not
 
00:22:12.789 --> 00:22:12.799 align:start position:0%
only in the on the civilian side but you
 
00:22:16.110 --> 00:22:16.120 align:start position:0%
know the the places that are involved in
 
00:22:19.149 --> 00:22:19.159 align:start position:0%
ship building uh on the military side uh
 
00:22:20.549 --> 00:22:20.559 align:start position:0%
are also
 
00:22:22.669 --> 00:22:22.679 align:start position:0%
impacted uh some of the strongest
 
00:22:24.870 --> 00:22:24.880 align:start position:0%
Transportation manufacturing Industries
 
00:22:26.950 --> 00:22:26.960 align:start position:0%
in the United States operate in a low
 
00:22:30.269 --> 00:22:30.279 align:start position:0%
tariff environment free trade Freer
 
00:22:33.070 --> 00:22:33.080 align:start position:0%
trade uh us production of aircraft
 
00:22:36.390 --> 00:22:36.400 align:start position:0%
Railroad stock automobiles big trucks
 
00:22:38.950 --> 00:22:38.960 align:start position:0%
has been increasing because there's
 
00:22:41.070 --> 00:22:41.080 align:start position:0%
competition and we can have foreign
 
00:22:43.590 --> 00:22:43.600 align:start position:0%
trucks I already made that point
 
00:22:46.430 --> 00:22:46.440 align:start position:0%
moreover the effective tariff rate for
 
00:22:49.350 --> 00:22:49.360 align:start position:0%
imported recreational boats uh you know
 
00:22:52.029 --> 00:22:52.039 align:start position:0%
if you ever been to Winn or lake
 
00:22:54.029 --> 00:22:54.039 align:start position:0%
the boats are everywhere some of these
 
00:22:57.110 --> 00:22:57.120 align:start position:0%
boats are built uh in other countries
 
00:22:58.990 --> 00:22:59.000 align:start position:0%
and they're not these recreational boats
 
00:23:01.149 --> 00:23:01.159 align:start position:0%
are not covered by the Jones act so we
 
00:23:04.190 --> 00:23:04.200 align:start position:0%
have all kinds of uh boats uh
 
00:23:06.549 --> 00:23:06.559 align:start position:0%
recreational boats that this does that
 
00:23:09.909 --> 00:23:09.919 align:start position:0%
aren't that we're fine so clearly
 
00:23:11.630 --> 00:23:11.640 align:start position:0%
American manufacturers don't require
 
00:23:13.710 --> 00:23:13.720 align:start position:0%
High tariffs to be successful in fact
 
00:23:15.710 --> 00:23:15.720 align:start position:0%
this success is contingent on low
 
00:23:17.350 --> 00:23:17.360 align:start position:0%
tariffs free
 
00:23:20.549 --> 00:23:20.559 align:start position:0%
trade um you know we don't we don't need
 
00:23:23.230 --> 00:23:23.240 align:start position:0%
barriers that that prevent Innovation
 
00:23:28.070 --> 00:23:28.080 align:start position:0%
and competition and quality so to head
 
00:23:29.830 --> 00:23:29.840 align:start position:0%
down the home stretch here here's a
 
00:23:31.710 --> 00:23:31.720 align:start position:0%
specific example there were many of them
 
00:23:34.310 --> 00:23:34.320 align:start position:0%
here's one of how the Jones act hurts
 
00:23:37.149 --> 00:23:37.159 align:start position:0%
America uh a Washington State fishing
 
00:23:39.590 --> 00:23:39.600 align:start position:0%
company called Fisherman's finest uh
 
00:23:41.350 --> 00:23:41.360 align:start position:0%
they commission a new ship as I said
 
00:23:43.350 --> 00:23:43.360 align:start position:0%
it's it's unfortunately it's hard to
 
00:23:46.029 --> 00:23:46.039 align:start position:0%
build ships now but we still build a few
 
00:23:48.630 --> 00:23:48.640 align:start position:0%
and so uh Fisherman's finest commission
 
00:23:52.070 --> 00:23:52.080 align:start position:0%
a new ship from uh a ship Builder Dakota
 
00:23:56.750 --> 00:23:56.760 align:start position:0%
Creek Industries however because 7% of
 
00:23:58.549 --> 00:23:58.559 align:start position:0%
that ship Steel
 
00:23:59.549 --> 00:23:59.559 align:start position:0%
was from
 
00:24:02.149 --> 00:24:02.159 align:start position:0%
Holland the ship was not allowed to fish
 
00:24:03.470 --> 00:24:03.480 align:start position:0%
in coastal
 
00:24:06.630 --> 00:24:06.640 align:start position:0%
Waters um I'm a George wool fan George
 
00:24:11.590 --> 00:24:11.600 align:start position:0%
Will wrote quote fomenting spous
 
00:24:14.470 --> 00:24:14.480 align:start position:0%
National Security anxieties is the first
 
00:24:17.510 --> 00:24:17.520 align:start position:0%
Refuge of rent seeking rent seeking
 
00:24:20.470 --> 00:24:20.480 align:start position:0%
Scoundrels who tired up protectionism is
 
00:24:23.070 --> 00:24:23.080 align:start position:0%
patriotism when they inv vagal
 
00:24:24.789 --> 00:24:24.799 align:start position:0%
government into lining their pockets
 
00:24:28.110 --> 00:24:28.120 align:start position:0%
with their fellow citizens money unquote
 
00:24:30.470 --> 00:24:30.480 align:start position:0%
so trade barriers undermine US security
 
00:24:33.310 --> 00:24:33.320 align:start position:0%
by weakening the economy and creating uh
 
00:24:36.710 --> 00:24:36.720 align:start position:0%
conflict with our allies by diminishing
 
00:24:40.149 --> 00:24:40.159 align:start position:0%
free trade so to make this relevant to
 
00:24:42.389 --> 00:24:42.399 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire New England here in New
 
00:24:44.630 --> 00:24:44.640 align:start position:0%
England we need fuel oil natural gas it
 
00:24:46.430 --> 00:24:46.440 align:start position:0%
was 5 degrees this morning I know it's
 
00:24:49.710 --> 00:24:49.720 align:start position:0%
been warm lately uh it was 5 degrees in
 
00:24:51.110 --> 00:24:51.120 align:start position:0%
Lowden I'm sure it was colder than that
 
00:24:54.110 --> 00:24:54.120 align:start position:0%
in Littleton I'm going to guess up North
 
00:24:56.230 --> 00:24:56.240 align:start position:0%
so it gets cold excuse me it gets cold
 
00:24:59.389 --> 00:24:59.399 align:start position:0%
here and we need fuel oil we need
 
00:25:02.149 --> 00:25:02.159 align:start position:0%
natural gas pipelines are great but some
 
00:25:03.909 --> 00:25:03.919 align:start position:0%
of you may know they're largely tapped
 
00:25:06.310 --> 00:25:06.320 align:start position:0%
out and regulations make it harder to
 
00:25:08.909 --> 00:25:08.919 align:start position:0%
build new ones we'd love many people
 
00:25:10.830 --> 00:25:10.840 align:start position:0%
love to have a pipeline but New York
 
00:25:13.510 --> 00:25:13.520 align:start position:0%
won't let the pipeline come to us so
 
00:25:15.310 --> 00:25:15.320 align:start position:0%
because New York won't let the pipeline
 
00:25:17.630 --> 00:25:17.640 align:start position:0%
come to us with for natural gas or
 
00:25:21.549 --> 00:25:21.559 align:start position:0%
whatever we need uh fuel oil or natural
 
00:25:25.110 --> 00:25:25.120 align:start position:0%
gas or whatever to come by
 
00:25:25.120 --> 00:25:26.669 align:start position:0%
gas or whatever to come by
ship

00:25:26.669 --> 00:25:26.679 align:start position:0%
ship
 
00:25:26.679 --> 00:25:28.310 align:start position:0%
ship
so

00:25:28.310 --> 00:25:28.320 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:25:30.950 --> 00:25:30.960 align:start position:0%
a recent Wall Street Journal
 
00:25:33.430 --> 00:25:33.440 align:start position:0%
article stated that the Jones act
 
00:25:36.029 --> 00:25:36.039 align:start position:0%
limitations add
 
00:25:36.039 --> 00:25:40.430 align:start position:0%
limitations add
costs

00:25:40.430 --> 00:25:40.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:43.310 --> 00:25:43.320 align:start position:0%
um the these added costs encourage fuel
 
00:25:47.590 --> 00:25:47.600 align:start position:0%
to be exported overseas and here's the a
 
00:25:49.830 --> 00:25:49.840 align:start position:0%
problem a good
 
00:25:52.630 --> 00:25:52.640 align:start position:0%
example there's a lot of O oil for
 
00:25:55.630 --> 00:25:55.640 align:start position:0%
example is comes out of Louisiana or
 
00:25:57.149 --> 00:25:57.159 align:start position:0%
that part of the country the the the
 
00:26:00.669 --> 00:26:00.679 align:start position:0%
southeast uh and because of the Jones
 
00:26:04.510 --> 00:26:04.520 align:start position:0%
act ships could take this oil to Holland
 
00:26:05.350 --> 00:26:05.360 align:start position:0%
to the
 
00:26:07.789 --> 00:26:07.799 align:start position:0%
Netherlands and they couldn't take it to
 
00:26:09.750 --> 00:26:09.760 align:start position:0%
New England so this this oil American
 
00:26:13.190 --> 00:26:13.200 align:start position:0%
Oil had to go to Europe and then uh
 
00:26:16.190 --> 00:26:16.200 align:start position:0%
ships in the Netherlands uh would take
 
00:26:19.269 --> 00:26:19.279 align:start position:0%
the soil to to New England so if you're
 
00:26:22.750 --> 00:26:22.760 align:start position:0%
tracking me uh they you go because of
 
00:26:24.710 --> 00:26:24.720 align:start position:0%
the Jones act this oil couldn't come to
 
00:26:26.510 --> 00:26:26.520 align:start position:0%
us from Louisiana it had to go to Europe
 
00:26:27.870 --> 00:26:27.880 align:start position:0%
and then come to us to meet the
 
00:26:29.750 --> 00:26:29.760 align:start position:0%
requirements of the Jones act I just
 
00:26:31.669 --> 00:26:31.679 align:start position:0%
don't think that increases costs
 
00:26:34.230 --> 00:26:34.240 align:start position:0%
increases uh expenses the expenses make
 
00:26:35.870 --> 00:26:35.880 align:start position:0%
fuel more expensive how much more
 
00:26:38.510 --> 00:26:38.520 align:start position:0%
expensive you know people debate that so
 
00:26:40.230 --> 00:26:40.240 align:start position:0%
anyway to finish up the Jones Z is over
 
00:26:42.590 --> 00:26:42.600 align:start position:0%
100 years old instead of receiving
 
00:26:44.950 --> 00:26:44.960 align:start position:0%
unending protection from International
 
00:26:48.029 --> 00:26:48.039 align:start position:0%
competition ship Builders should operate
 
00:26:50.549 --> 00:26:50.559 align:start position:0%
in the same low tariff policy under
 
00:26:52.789 --> 00:26:52.799 align:start position:0%
which manufacturers of trucks
 
00:26:55.190 --> 00:26:55.200 align:start position:0%
automobiles aircraft and other
 
00:26:58.029 --> 00:26:58.039 align:start position:0%
Industries are thriving the Jones act
 
00:27:00.269 --> 00:27:00.279 align:start position:0%
should not be allowed to inflict another
 
00:27:02.510 --> 00:27:02.520 align:start position:0%
100 years or another 10 years or another
 
00:27:04.549 --> 00:27:04.559 align:start position:0%
one year of of damage in the United
 
00:27:06.549 --> 00:27:06.559 align:start position:0%
States economy so I hope in this gets to
 
00:27:07.950 --> 00:27:07.960 align:start position:0%
exec session you'll support this
 
00:27:09.750 --> 00:27:09.760 align:start position:0%
resolution I know you'll hear more about
 
00:27:11.350 --> 00:27:11.360 align:start position:0%
it today and you'll have plenty of time
 
00:27:13.830 --> 00:27:13.840 align:start position:0%
to uh review all the testimony and I'll
 
00:27:15.350 --> 00:27:15.360 align:start position:0%
be happy to take any questions if there
 
00:27:18.430 --> 00:27:18.440 align:start position:0%
are any do I have any questions
 
00:27:21.029 --> 00:27:21.039 align:start position:0%
represent Char thank you thank you for
 
00:27:23.830 --> 00:27:23.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:27.789 --> 00:27:27.799 align:start position:0%
question um the Jones act requires uh
 
00:27:30.190 --> 00:27:30.200 align:start position:0%
cargo being transported between us ports
 
00:27:32.750 --> 00:27:32.760 align:start position:0%
to go on US flag
 
00:27:35.789 --> 00:27:35.799 align:start position:0%
carriers we have uh several islands
 
00:27:39.669 --> 00:27:39.679 align:start position:0%
Virgin Islands Squam Hawaii American
 
00:27:43.710 --> 00:27:43.720 align:start position:0%
Samoa um Puerto Rico uh that don't have
 
00:27:46.389 --> 00:27:46.399 align:start position:0%
the capability of producing food enough
 
00:27:48.029 --> 00:27:48.039 align:start position:0%
food in those islands for their own
 
00:27:50.789 --> 00:27:50.799 align:start position:0%
people Everything Must Go On American
 
00:27:53.230 --> 00:27:53.240 align:start position:0%
flag carrier to those islands do you
 
00:27:57.630 --> 00:27:57.640 align:start position:0%
have any idea what that may cost the
 
00:28:00.430 --> 00:28:00.440 align:start position:0%
increasing cost for those people and
 
00:28:03.269 --> 00:28:03.279 align:start position:0%
many of them are lowincome to have food
 
00:28:05.310 --> 00:28:05.320 align:start position:0%
shipped to those islands on American
 
00:28:07.870 --> 00:28:07.880 align:start position:0%
flag caras thank you for the question I
 
00:28:08.909 --> 00:28:08.919 align:start position:0%
hadn't thought of that it's a great
 
00:28:10.870 --> 00:28:10.880 align:start position:0%
question now now that you mentioned it I
 
00:28:13.110 --> 00:28:13.120 align:start position:0%
don't have a an immediate answer to that
 
00:28:15.430 --> 00:28:15.440 align:start position:0%
but that's something I want to look into
 
00:28:17.350 --> 00:28:17.360 align:start position:0%
I had mentioned the the problems with
 
00:28:19.990 --> 00:28:20.000 align:start position:0%
fuel um but you you bring up the
 
00:28:22.350 --> 00:28:22.360 align:start position:0%
problems with some places with food I
 
00:28:23.830 --> 00:28:23.840 align:start position:0%
hadn't thought of that but that's
 
00:28:24.950 --> 00:28:24.960 align:start position:0%
something I'm going to find out more
 
00:28:26.630 --> 00:28:26.640 align:start position:0%
about because that's a great question
 
00:28:28.110 --> 00:28:28.120 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:28:30.149 --> 00:28:30.159 align:start position:0%
I think food is important to be able to
 
00:28:32.190 --> 00:28:32.200 align:start position:0%
move freely in our country as well as
 
00:28:35.750 --> 00:28:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:37.870 --> 00:28:37.880 align:start position:0%
question another
 
00:28:40.230 --> 00:28:40.240 align:start position:0%
question representative Manion
 
00:28:42.470 --> 00:28:42.480 align:start position:0%
representative Manion excuse me I had my
 
00:28:42.480 --> 00:28:43.230 align:start position:0%
representative Manion excuse me I had my
hand

00:28:43.230 --> 00:28:43.240 align:start position:0%
hand
 
00:28:46.950 --> 00:28:46.960 align:start position:0%
up I had my hand up first okay finny
 
00:28:48.750 --> 00:28:48.760 align:start position:0%
he's Manion I'm
 
00:28:51.070 --> 00:28:51.080 align:start position:0%
finny uh thanks I just wanted to know if
 
00:28:52.509 --> 00:28:52.519 align:start position:0%
you know how many states have already
 
00:28:54.509 --> 00:28:54.519 align:start position:0%
pushed this through through through the
 
00:28:57.110 --> 00:28:57.120 align:start position:0%
legislators question I think I heard was
 
00:28:59.310 --> 00:28:59.320 align:start position:0%
how many many other states are pushing
 
00:29:02.029 --> 00:29:02.039 align:start position:0%
uh this type of resolution to pressure
 
00:29:04.950 --> 00:29:04.960 align:start position:0%
Congress into repealing the Jones act uh
 
00:29:07.909 --> 00:29:07.919 align:start position:0%
a good number of other states are
 
00:29:10.870 --> 00:29:10.880 align:start position:0%
um the reason I brought this up was that
 
00:29:12.950 --> 00:29:12.960 align:start position:0%
I was at a legislative conference where
 
00:29:14.549 --> 00:29:14.559 align:start position:0%
there was a session on this that I just
 
00:29:17.110 --> 00:29:17.120 align:start position:0%
happened to sit in on that much better
 
00:29:18.990 --> 00:29:19.000 align:start position:0%
much better than I just did explained
 
00:29:20.470 --> 00:29:20.480 align:start position:0%
the the concerns and problems with the
 
00:29:24.029 --> 00:29:24.039 align:start position:0%
Jones act so I know that uh other states
 
00:29:25.710 --> 00:29:25.720 align:start position:0%
are doing the same thing in terms of
 
00:29:26.950 --> 00:29:26.960 align:start position:0%
trying to shine a light and raise
 
00:29:28.269 --> 00:29:28.279 align:start position:0%
awareness about the problems of the
 
00:29:30.149 --> 00:29:30.159 align:start position:0%
Jones act so I don't know how many other
 
00:29:32.990 --> 00:29:33.000 align:start position:0%
states but I know uh this is also being
 
00:29:35.149 --> 00:29:35.159 align:start position:0%
uh addressed elsewhere as well thank you
 
00:29:37.430 --> 00:29:37.440 align:start position:0%
for the
 
00:29:40.669 --> 00:29:40.679 align:start position:0%
question go ahead
 
00:29:42.630 --> 00:29:42.640 align:start position:0%
representative thank you for taking my
 
00:29:45.029 --> 00:29:45.039 align:start position:0%
question um the concerns that I'd seen
 
00:29:48.630 --> 00:29:48.640 align:start position:0%
on on this particular Bill were um
 
00:29:52.149 --> 00:29:52.159 align:start position:0%
around security um and on supplies being
 
00:29:54.710 --> 00:29:54.720 align:start position:0%
delivered specifically to um us cargo
 
00:29:58.029 --> 00:29:58.039 align:start position:0%
ships and I was curious if um um you
 
00:30:00.549 --> 00:30:00.559 align:start position:0%
could address some of that and is there
 
00:30:02.310 --> 00:30:02.320 align:start position:0%
any way that you have looked into this
 
00:30:05.710 --> 00:30:05.720 align:start position:0%
to somehow divest that piece of it from
 
00:30:08.590 --> 00:30:08.600 align:start position:0%
the piece that is the ship building um
 
00:30:11.430 --> 00:30:11.440 align:start position:0%
which seems to be the higher cost sure
 
00:30:13.230 --> 00:30:13.240 align:start position:0%
good question uh with regard to
 
00:30:15.430 --> 00:30:15.440 align:start position:0%
separating the security concerns from
 
00:30:17.830 --> 00:30:17.840 align:start position:0%
the the ship building piece there yeah
 
00:30:20.070 --> 00:30:20.080 align:start position:0%
the different pieces
 
00:30:23.950 --> 00:30:23.960 align:start position:0%
are involved with the Jones act uh the
 
00:30:26.389 --> 00:30:26.399 align:start position:0%
security part I did touch on that and
 
00:30:28.870 --> 00:30:28.880 align:start position:0%
this may come up later
 
00:30:32.830 --> 00:30:32.840 align:start position:0%
uh concern that have come up are that if
 
00:30:36.070 --> 00:30:36.080 align:start position:0%
you have foreign ships uh moving about
 
00:30:38.870 --> 00:30:38.880 align:start position:0%
the the Mississippi River I I've heard
 
00:30:38.880 --> 00:30:40.110 align:start position:0%
the the Mississippi River I I've heard
that

00:30:40.110 --> 00:30:40.120 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:30:43.269 --> 00:30:43.279 align:start position:0%
or in any Harbor you know could have
 
00:30:44.870 --> 00:30:44.880 align:start position:0%
foreign ship with that increase the
 
00:30:47.590 --> 00:30:47.600 align:start position:0%
likelihood of like terrorism uh so that
 
00:30:49.269 --> 00:30:49.279 align:start position:0%
security concern has come up I I
 
00:30:51.070 --> 00:30:51.080 align:start position:0%
mentioned it earlier and you asked a
 
00:30:53.269 --> 00:30:53.279 align:start position:0%
good question about it but as I
 
00:30:55.310 --> 00:30:55.320 align:start position:0%
mentioned earlier
 
00:31:00.190 --> 00:31:00.200 align:start position:0%
uh there are all kind kinds of of uh U
 
00:31:04.789 --> 00:31:04.799 align:start position:0%
protocols in place to ensure that anyone
 
00:31:08.029 --> 00:31:08.039 align:start position:0%
who is working in any capacity legally
 
00:31:10.230 --> 00:31:10.240 align:start position:0%
anyway working legally in any capacity
 
00:31:12.789 --> 00:31:12.799 align:start position:0%
has to uh you know show who they are
 
00:31:14.830 --> 00:31:14.840 align:start position:0%
they have to have uh visas or work
 
00:31:17.149 --> 00:31:17.159 align:start position:0%
permits uh green cards and that type of
 
00:31:19.470 --> 00:31:19.480 align:start position:0%
thing so th those security measures are
 
00:31:20.629 --> 00:31:20.639 align:start position:0%
in place
 
00:31:27.430 --> 00:31:27.440 align:start position:0%
for uh all kinds of jobs um and so this
 
00:31:30.629 --> 00:31:30.639 align:start position:0%
the security concerns that the Jones act
 
00:31:34.629 --> 00:31:34.639 align:start position:0%
supposedly helps to prevent uh I think
 
00:31:36.549 --> 00:31:36.559 align:start position:0%
really aren't relevant you know if if
 
00:31:38.310 --> 00:31:38.320 align:start position:0%
somebody can
 
00:31:41.710 --> 00:31:41.720 align:start position:0%
work for a bus transport or Train
 
00:31:46.789 --> 00:31:46.799 align:start position:0%
Transport or trucks uh and they're not
 
00:31:49.590 --> 00:31:49.600 align:start position:0%
citizens you know or Americans you know
 
00:31:54.990 --> 00:31:55.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:01.310 --> 00:32:01.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:05.990 --> 00:32:06.000 align:start position:0%
during co uh we experienced a situation
 
00:32:08.470 --> 00:32:08.480 align:start position:0%
where we didn't have any microchips for
 
00:32:10.389 --> 00:32:10.399 align:start position:0%
any of our Electronics because they were
 
00:32:13.190 --> 00:32:13.200 align:start position:0%
all made out of the country can you see
 
00:32:16.430 --> 00:32:16.440 align:start position:0%
a situation where because we are unable
 
00:32:18.830 --> 00:32:18.840 align:start position:0%
to do ship building in our own country
 
00:32:21.590 --> 00:32:21.600 align:start position:0%
and a reliant on outside of our country
 
00:32:25.029 --> 00:32:25.039 align:start position:0%
to get our ships we might experience a
 
00:32:25.039 --> 00:32:26.070 align:start position:0%
to get our ships we might experience a
similar

00:32:26.070 --> 00:32:26.080 align:start position:0%
similar
 
00:32:27.909 --> 00:32:27.919 align:start position:0%
situation yeah thank you for the
 
00:32:31.230 --> 00:32:31.240 align:start position:0%
question um and you mentioned uh
 
00:32:34.070 --> 00:32:34.080 align:start position:0%
computer chips uh many of which are made
 
00:32:36.149 --> 00:32:36.159 align:start position:0%
in Taiwan uh which goes to a different
 
00:32:39.830 --> 00:32:39.840 align:start position:0%
resolution that I had a week ago um but
 
00:32:42.389 --> 00:32:42.399 align:start position:0%
yeah I touched on that that's a a great
 
00:32:46.029 --> 00:32:46.039 align:start position:0%
point is there a security concern if if
 
00:32:50.629 --> 00:32:50.639 align:start position:0%
uh if ships are if we depend on
 
00:32:53.310 --> 00:32:53.320 align:start position:0%
foreign uh help with for whether it's
 
00:32:56.509 --> 00:32:56.519 align:start position:0%
foreign steel or foreign pirats uh I
 
00:32:58.430 --> 00:32:58.440 align:start position:0%
mentioned in my testimony just because
 
00:33:01.389 --> 00:33:01.399 align:start position:0%
7% of the steel in a in a certain ship
 
00:33:04.549 --> 00:33:04.559 align:start position:0%
came from non-american sources then that
 
00:33:07.909 --> 00:33:07.919 align:start position:0%
uh ship uh was not qualified under the
 
00:33:09.830 --> 00:33:09.840 align:start position:0%
Jones act so to your point to your
 
00:33:12.629 --> 00:33:12.639 align:start position:0%
question uh that I think is a very valid
 
00:33:15.190 --> 00:33:15.200 align:start position:0%
concern for SEC uh not only for economic
 
00:33:17.590 --> 00:33:17.600 align:start position:0%
reasons but national security reasons if
 
00:33:20.389 --> 00:33:20.399 align:start position:0%
if our ship building industry is is is
 
00:33:23.549 --> 00:33:23.559 align:start position:0%
waned as much as it has uh you know as a
 
00:33:26.149 --> 00:33:26.159 align:start position:0%
military person I I'm very concerned
 
00:33:30.190 --> 00:33:30.200 align:start position:0%
about the our shrinking Navy and U you
 
00:33:33.110 --> 00:33:33.120 align:start position:0%
know Portsmouth Naval Shipyard does do
 
00:33:36.190 --> 00:33:36.200 align:start position:0%
some fitting of ships and they you'll
 
00:33:39.950 --> 00:33:39.960 align:start position:0%
build a submarine there uh up in Maine
 
00:33:42.750 --> 00:33:42.760 align:start position:0%
um at the Iron Works that they build
 
00:33:46.549 --> 00:33:46.559 align:start position:0%
ships and it takes forever and and uh we
 
00:33:48.389 --> 00:33:48.399 align:start position:0%
just don't build ships like we used to
 
00:33:50.990 --> 00:33:51.000 align:start position:0%
and part of the reason the Jones act uh
 
00:33:53.830 --> 00:33:53.840 align:start position:0%
thank you for that that great
 
00:33:53.840 --> 00:33:55.669 align:start position:0%
thank you for that that great
question

00:33:55.669 --> 00:33:55.679 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:33:57.549 --> 00:33:57.559 align:start position:0%
representative thank you for taking my
 
00:34:00.110 --> 00:34:00.120 align:start position:0%
question last year on Commerce Committee
 
00:34:02.190 --> 00:34:02.200 align:start position:0%
we heard very similar testimony to a
 
00:34:04.590 --> 00:34:04.600 align:start position:0%
bill concerning the Jones act uh and
 
00:34:07.110 --> 00:34:07.120 align:start position:0%
commerce voted 18 18 to Zer to place
 
00:34:09.669 --> 00:34:09.679 align:start position:0%
that on a consent calendar itl which was
 
00:34:12.230 --> 00:34:12.240 align:start position:0%
adopted by the house in what Manner does
 
00:34:15.589 --> 00:34:15.599 align:start position:0%
this bill uh differ from Senate Bill 102
 
00:34:17.030 --> 00:34:17.040 align:start position:0%
and what has changed since last year
 
00:34:18.310 --> 00:34:18.320 align:start position:0%
regarding the Jones act which would
 
00:34:20.669 --> 00:34:20.679 align:start position:0%
prompt this action now sure thank you
 
00:34:22.629 --> 00:34:22.639 align:start position:0%
for the question uh I think you're
 
00:34:24.950 --> 00:34:24.960 align:start position:0%
referring to a bill and I'd have to look
 
00:34:26.550 --> 00:34:26.560 align:start position:0%
at the language of the bill you're ahead
 
00:34:29.190 --> 00:34:29.200 align:start position:0%
of me that this is not a bill this is a
 
00:34:31.109 --> 00:34:31.119 align:start position:0%
resolution and the intent of this
 
00:34:34.629 --> 00:34:34.639 align:start position:0%
resolution is to uh raise awareness
 
00:34:37.109 --> 00:34:37.119 align:start position:0%
about the problems with the Jones act
 
00:34:39.430 --> 00:34:39.440 align:start position:0%
and hopefully to prompt eventually
 
00:34:42.470 --> 00:34:42.480 align:start position:0%
congressional action to repeal it uh and
 
00:34:44.349 --> 00:34:44.359 align:start position:0%
so just the fact that we're having this
 
00:34:46.389 --> 00:34:46.399 align:start position:0%
sharing we're talking about it and that
 
00:34:49.869 --> 00:34:49.879 align:start position:0%
um people are watching and will watch on
 
00:34:52.030 --> 00:34:52.040 align:start position:0%
YouTube and then there'll be more
 
00:34:54.190 --> 00:34:54.200 align:start position:0%
testimony and we'll have an exec session
 
00:34:56.310 --> 00:34:56.320 align:start position:0%
so that's the intent of the resolution
 
00:34:58.950 --> 00:34:58.960 align:start position:0%
um I very interesting I and I want to
 
00:35:01.030 --> 00:35:01.040 align:start position:0%
find out more about the what you
 
00:35:03.069 --> 00:35:03.079 align:start position:0%
described because if there are
 
00:35:05.870 --> 00:35:05.880 align:start position:0%
precedents in in terms of addressing the
 
00:35:10.030 --> 00:35:10.040 align:start position:0%
Jones act in in this body uh um I'd be
 
00:35:11.750 --> 00:35:11.760 align:start position:0%
interested to to go back and read
 
00:35:13.550 --> 00:35:13.560 align:start position:0%
whatever went to Commerce Committee
 
00:35:15.470 --> 00:35:15.480 align:start position:0%
which I I think that was a bill though
 
00:35:18.190 --> 00:35:18.200 align:start position:0%
not a resolution correct uh correct it
 
00:35:19.750 --> 00:35:19.760 align:start position:0%
was a it was a Senate bill which was
 
00:35:21.349 --> 00:35:21.359 align:start position:0%
actually to create a a study committee
 
00:35:23.870 --> 00:35:23.880 align:start position:0%
to send a similar resolution to Congress
 
00:35:26.150 --> 00:35:26.160 align:start position:0%
regarding the Jones act so it prompted
 
00:35:27.710 --> 00:35:27.720 align:start position:0%
very similar testimony to what we've
 
00:35:31.589 --> 00:35:31.599 align:start position:0%
just heard which prompted the 18 itl so
 
00:35:34.630 --> 00:35:34.640 align:start position:0%
that if I may may ask you a question uh
 
00:35:37.710 --> 00:35:37.720 align:start position:0%
Mr chair may I ask him a question
 
00:35:40.630 --> 00:35:40.640 align:start position:0%
absolutely um so so the measure you
 
00:35:42.430 --> 00:35:42.440 align:start position:0%
described was a Senate bill that passed
 
00:35:44.390 --> 00:35:44.400 align:start position:0%
the Senate came to the house Commerce
 
00:35:45.990 --> 00:35:46.000 align:start position:0%
Committee where it didn't move forward
 
00:35:48.430 --> 00:35:48.440 align:start position:0%
is that correct uh that that's correct I
 
00:35:50.550 --> 00:35:50.560 align:start position:0%
don't know what the vote was in the
 
00:35:52.510 --> 00:35:52.520 align:start position:0%
Senate but it did move to house Commerce
 
00:35:55.150 --> 00:35:55.160 align:start position:0%
where it was uh ited and I actually
 
00:35:57.150 --> 00:35:57.160 align:start position:0%
wrote the report on it which is why I to
 
00:36:00.510 --> 00:36:00.520 align:start position:0%
remember uh this particular Bill okay
 
00:36:01.589 --> 00:36:01.599 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm very interested I want to find
 
00:36:03.030 --> 00:36:03.040 align:start position:0%
out more about that if it passed the
 
00:36:05.630 --> 00:36:05.640 align:start position:0%
Senate it must have had some value but
 
00:36:08.550 --> 00:36:08.560 align:start position:0%
uh not every Senate measure U makes it
 
00:36:12.109 --> 00:36:12.119 align:start position:0%
through our our U our
 
00:36:14.910 --> 00:36:14.920 align:start position:0%
body any further
 
00:36:16.829 --> 00:36:16.839 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you
 
00:36:21.510 --> 00:36:21.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:24.069 --> 00:36:24.079 align:start position:0%
chair next one up Dan Maguire
 
00:36:25.710 --> 00:36:25.720 align:start position:0%
representative Dan
 
00:36:25.720 --> 00:36:33.150 align:start position:0%
representative Dan
mgu

00:36:33.150 --> 00:36:33.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:34.790 --> 00:36:34.800 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and members of the
 
00:36:36.470 --> 00:36:36.480 align:start position:0%
committee for the record my name is Dan
 
00:36:39.309 --> 00:36:39.319 align:start position:0%
Maguire I represent the town of Epsom
 
00:36:44.230 --> 00:36:44.240 align:start position:0%
I'm a co-sponsor of this bill and um I
 
00:36:47.470 --> 00:36:47.480 align:start position:0%
also handed out to you a short article
 
00:36:51.510 --> 00:36:51.520 align:start position:0%
um for more short C shipping get the
 
00:36:55.030 --> 00:36:55.040 align:start position:0%
federal government out of the way um I
 
00:36:57.630 --> 00:36:57.640 align:start position:0%
just want to add I I agree with uh
 
00:37:01.510 --> 00:37:01.520 align:start position:0%
representative moffett's uh um testimony
 
00:37:03.870 --> 00:37:03.880 align:start position:0%
but I I'll add you know a couple more
 
00:37:07.109 --> 00:37:07.119 align:start position:0%
examples to to try to bring things um a
 
00:37:10.910 --> 00:37:10.920 align:start position:0%
little bit more into our own lives um if
 
00:37:13.190 --> 00:37:13.200 align:start position:0%
you're somebody like me who likes to
 
00:37:17.670 --> 00:37:17.680 align:start position:0%
take cruises for example um you you know
 
00:37:19.910 --> 00:37:19.920 align:start position:0%
you'll notice pretty e quickly that if
 
00:37:22.309 --> 00:37:22.319 align:start position:0%
you want to take a cruise out of Boston
 
00:37:24.589 --> 00:37:24.599 align:start position:0%
you have basically two choices you can
 
00:37:26.790 --> 00:37:26.800 align:start position:0%
cruise up to Canada or you can go to ber
 
00:37:31.030 --> 00:37:31.040 align:start position:0%
muda right um for some reason you can't
 
00:37:33.870 --> 00:37:33.880 align:start position:0%
take a cruise from Boston down the East
 
00:37:36.750 --> 00:37:36.760 align:start position:0%
Coast you know and stop in New York and
 
00:37:39.030 --> 00:37:39.040 align:start position:0%
Charleston and Florida and stuff like
 
00:37:41.510 --> 00:37:41.520 align:start position:0%
that well why is that that's the Jones
 
00:37:45.390 --> 00:37:45.400 align:start position:0%
act right uh similar reason you can't
 
00:37:48.390 --> 00:37:48.400 align:start position:0%
fly to Hawaii and just take a cruise
 
00:37:50.190 --> 00:37:50.200 align:start position:0%
right around the Hawaiian islands and
 
00:37:53.430 --> 00:37:53.440 align:start position:0%
fly home you have to cruise the Hawaiian
 
00:37:55.910 --> 00:37:55.920 align:start position:0%
islands and then your cruise ship has to
 
00:37:57.109 --> 00:37:57.119 align:start position:0%
take a short
 
00:37:59.790 --> 00:37:59.800 align:start position:0%
you know go off to vanatu or some other
 
00:38:03.430 --> 00:38:03.440 align:start position:0%
little island nation somewhere or you
 
00:38:05.470 --> 00:38:05.480 align:start position:0%
have to start in Los Angeles go to
 
00:38:08.150 --> 00:38:08.160 align:start position:0%
Hawaii come back to Mexico and then come
 
00:38:11.270 --> 00:38:11.280 align:start position:0%
back to Los Angeles that's the Jones act
 
00:38:14.030 --> 00:38:14.040 align:start position:0%
for you the Jones act because all cruise
 
00:38:17.750 --> 00:38:17.760 align:start position:0%
ships and most Cruise crew are uh
 
00:38:20.430 --> 00:38:20.440 align:start position:0%
foreign right because it's so much
 
00:38:24.990 --> 00:38:25.000 align:start position:0%
cheaper um the Jones act requires that
 
00:38:27.750 --> 00:38:27.760 align:start position:0%
such trips include foreign stop they
 
00:38:32.990 --> 00:38:33.000 align:start position:0%
can't be 100% domestic and so um it
 
00:38:35.230 --> 00:38:35.240 align:start position:0%
affects us I mean that's a simple one
 
00:38:37.990 --> 00:38:38.000 align:start position:0%
but it but it does affect us the the
 
00:38:40.270 --> 00:38:40.280 align:start position:0%
more serious example is the one
 
00:38:42.870 --> 00:38:42.880 align:start position:0%
representative Moffett mentioned
 
00:38:46.990 --> 00:38:47.000 align:start position:0%
fuel right so so an extremely important
 
00:38:52.109 --> 00:38:52.119 align:start position:0%
fuel um for New England is natural gas
 
00:38:53.990 --> 00:38:54.000 align:start position:0%
that's why we're in a nice warm room
 
00:38:55.790 --> 00:38:55.800 align:start position:0%
today and right outside that window it's
 
00:38:55.800 --> 00:38:57.710 align:start position:0%
today and right outside that window it's
25°

00:38:57.710 --> 00:38:57.720 align:start position:0%
25°
 
00:39:00.510 --> 00:39:00.520 align:start position:0%
um it's and and that's what's keeping
 
00:39:03.870 --> 00:39:03.880 align:start position:0%
our lights on is natural gas and so the
 
00:39:06.390 --> 00:39:06.400 align:start position:0%
the consequence of the Jones Act is we
 
00:39:09.430 --> 00:39:09.440 align:start position:0%
pay twice as much for electricity as
 
00:39:12.750 --> 00:39:12.760 align:start position:0%
they do down South for example because
 
00:39:15.910 --> 00:39:15.920 align:start position:0%
we have to import all our fuel and it
 
00:39:19.430 --> 00:39:19.440 align:start position:0%
has to come by very expensive means
 
00:39:22.470 --> 00:39:22.480 align:start position:0%
right so we can't just a natural gas
 
00:39:25.910 --> 00:39:25.920 align:start position:0%
ship can't go from Louisiana to Boston
 
00:39:29.430 --> 00:39:29.440 align:start position:0%
and drop off its gas right we have to
 
00:39:31.750 --> 00:39:31.760 align:start position:0%
all the ships that leave Louisiana with
 
00:39:35.630 --> 00:39:35.640 align:start position:0%
with gas go to Europe and we import at
 
00:39:38.870 --> 00:39:38.880 align:start position:0%
least we used to from Russia our natural
 
00:39:41.109 --> 00:39:41.119 align:start position:0%
gas we can't use American natural gas I
 
00:39:43.109 --> 00:39:43.119 align:start position:0%
mean it's just it's just really
 
00:39:46.670 --> 00:39:46.680 align:start position:0%
ridiculous and and it causes our prices
 
00:39:49.870 --> 00:39:49.880 align:start position:0%
to just be out of this world
 
00:39:52.750 --> 00:39:52.760 align:start position:0%
um so that's the Jones act for you I
 
00:39:57.309 --> 00:39:57.319 align:start position:0%
mean and and um if you're worried about
 
00:40:00.150 --> 00:40:00.160 align:start position:0%
you know American industry Etc the the
 
00:40:03.349 --> 00:40:03.359 align:start position:0%
thing is even with the Jones act we
 
00:40:05.870 --> 00:40:05.880 align:start position:0%
don't have a ship building industry
 
00:40:08.710 --> 00:40:08.720 align:start position:0%
natural gas ships for example um there
 
00:40:11.390 --> 00:40:11.400 align:start position:0%
are a handful of natural gas ships made
 
00:40:13.670 --> 00:40:13.680 align:start position:0%
in the United States but they're little
 
00:40:17.309 --> 00:40:17.319 align:start position:0%
tiny ones that just move they refuel
 
00:40:19.270 --> 00:40:19.280 align:start position:0%
other ships right they have little tiny
 
00:40:22.550 --> 00:40:22.560 align:start position:0%
amounts of gas big big you know the
 
00:40:25.069 --> 00:40:25.079 align:start position:0%
ships that are made in South Korea or
 
00:40:26.870 --> 00:40:26.880 align:start position:0%
Germany or whatever
 
00:40:30.990 --> 00:40:31.000 align:start position:0%
those ships hand have 50 or 40 times as
 
00:40:32.750 --> 00:40:32.760 align:start position:0%
much natural gas those are the real
 
00:40:36.309 --> 00:40:36.319 align:start position:0%
ships that that ship things in bulk and
 
00:40:38.349 --> 00:40:38.359 align:start position:0%
and and those are simply not made in the
 
00:40:40.990 --> 00:40:41.000 align:start position:0%
United States so so even the purpose of
 
00:40:44.270 --> 00:40:44.280 align:start position:0%
the Jones act isn't working right so if
 
00:40:46.630 --> 00:40:46.640 align:start position:0%
the purpose was to to boost American
 
00:40:50.069 --> 00:40:50.079 align:start position:0%
industry well it's not doing it right so
 
00:40:53.190 --> 00:40:53.200 align:start position:0%
um and if you want a a simple in another
 
00:40:55.950 --> 00:40:55.960 align:start position:0%
uh field if you want a simple example of
 
00:40:58.870 --> 00:40:58.880 align:start position:0%
the benefits of deregulation of of of
 
00:41:02.030 --> 00:41:02.040 align:start position:0%
getting rid of protectionism in this way
 
00:41:05.309 --> 00:41:05.319 align:start position:0%
just go read up on uh New Zealand and
 
00:41:09.829 --> 00:41:09.839 align:start position:0%
the uh Farm um deregulation they did in
 
00:41:12.750 --> 00:41:12.760 align:start position:0%
the in the 80s because it's been a
 
00:41:16.109 --> 00:41:16.119 align:start position:0%
tremendous boost to to uh New Zealand
 
00:41:18.829 --> 00:41:18.839 align:start position:0%
farming they used to have subsidies they
 
00:41:20.710 --> 00:41:20.720 align:start position:0%
used to have protectionism they used to
 
00:41:22.430 --> 00:41:22.440 align:start position:0%
have stuff that's equivalent to the
 
00:41:25.150 --> 00:41:25.160 align:start position:0%
Jones act they got rid of it they had a
 
00:41:26.910 --> 00:41:26.920 align:start position:0%
little hiccups for a while
 
00:41:30.069 --> 00:41:30.079 align:start position:0%
but they're they currently um New
 
00:41:32.829 --> 00:41:32.839 align:start position:0%
Zealand has 5 million people but they
 
00:41:35.150 --> 00:41:35.160 align:start position:0%
make enough food for 40 million people
 
00:41:38.950 --> 00:41:38.960 align:start position:0%
you know so uh their farming business is
 
00:41:41.829 --> 00:41:41.839 align:start position:0%
is tremendous so um thank you very much
 
00:41:44.790 --> 00:41:44.800 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman will you take any questions
 
00:41:46.710 --> 00:41:46.720 align:start position:0%
uh sure I I listened to a few of the
 
00:41:49.150 --> 00:41:49.160 align:start position:0%
others I'm not sure I can answer almost
 
00:41:51.589 --> 00:41:51.599 align:start position:0%
any of them I'll I'll make a comment on
 
00:41:54.390 --> 00:41:54.400 align:start position:0%
this um study committee thing uh part of
 
00:41:57.109 --> 00:41:57.119 align:start position:0%
the reason the the house
 
00:41:58.990 --> 00:41:59.000 align:start position:0%
the Senate loves study committees and
 
00:42:00.829 --> 00:42:00.839 align:start position:0%
they they pass them like candy or
 
00:42:03.470 --> 00:42:03.480 align:start position:0%
something but but uh the house doesn't
 
00:42:04.950 --> 00:42:04.960 align:start position:0%
and so that could have been what
 
00:42:06.910 --> 00:42:06.920 align:start position:0%
happened to to the bill that was talking
 
00:42:10.790 --> 00:42:10.800 align:start position:0%

testifying today in opposition to
 
00:43:02.430 --> 00:43:02.440 align:start position:0%
hr19 uh the Jones act known formerly as
 
00:43:04.510 --> 00:43:04.520 align:start position:0%
the merchant Mariner Act of 1920 is the
 
00:43:06.390 --> 00:43:06.400 align:start position:0%
United States law requiring cargo move
 
00:43:08.069 --> 00:43:08.079 align:start position:0%
between us ports be transported on
 
00:43:10.470 --> 00:43:10.480 align:start position:0%
vessels owned by us companies built in
 
00:43:13.270 --> 00:43:13.280 align:start position:0%
US shipyards and crewed by us Mariners
 
00:43:14.630 --> 00:43:14.640 align:start position:0%
the men and women of the US Towing
 
00:43:16.870 --> 00:43:16.880 align:start position:0%
industry comprise the largest segment of
 
00:43:20.150 --> 00:43:20.160 align:start position:0%
the 40,000 vessel strong Jones act Fleet
 
00:43:21.270 --> 00:43:21.280 align:start position:0%
and they play a vital role in the
 
00:43:23.750 --> 00:43:23.760 align:start position:0%
nation's supply chain the US Maritime
 
00:43:26.270 --> 00:43:26.280 align:start position:0%
industry supports more than 650,000
 
00:43:28.470 --> 00:43:28.480 align:start position:0%
people and contributes more than $150
 
00:43:30.829 --> 00:43:30.839 align:start position:0%
billion in economic input in New
 
00:43:32.510 --> 00:43:32.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire alone the maritime industry
 
00:43:34.790 --> 00:43:34.800 align:start position:0%
contributes over $230 million annually
 
00:43:36.870 --> 00:43:36.880 align:start position:0%
the state economy provides good family
 
00:43:39.230 --> 00:43:39.240 align:start position:0%
wage jobs for New Hampshire residents
 
00:43:41.470 --> 00:43:41.480 align:start position:0%
the Jones act has broad support across
 
00:43:43.270 --> 00:43:43.280 align:start position:0%
the political Spectrum as well as across
 
00:43:45.630 --> 00:43:45.640 align:start position:0%
the United States uh to address your
 
00:43:47.270 --> 00:43:47.280 align:start position:0%
question representative finny no state
 
00:43:50.349 --> 00:43:50.359 align:start position:0%
has passed a resolution uh calling for
 
00:43:52.670 --> 00:43:52.680 align:start position:0%
abolishing the Jones
 
00:43:56.069 --> 00:43:56.079 align:start position:0%
act um ensuring that Americans serve
 
00:43:57.549 --> 00:43:57.559 align:start position:0%
Americans helps both workers and
 
00:43:59.430 --> 00:43:59.440 align:start position:0%
businesses but the Jones act also serves
 
00:44:00.750 --> 00:44:00.760 align:start position:0%
the United States another important
 
00:44:02.990 --> 00:44:03.000 align:start position:0%
respect being National Security
 
00:44:04.630 --> 00:44:04.640 align:start position:0%
addressing the text of the resolution I
 
00:44:05.950 --> 00:44:05.960 align:start position:0%
want to start with the first Clause that
 
00:44:07.270 --> 00:44:07.280 align:start position:0%
states the Jones act has been a
 
00:44:09.910 --> 00:44:09.920 align:start position:0%
detriment to National Security I agree
 
00:44:12.790 --> 00:44:12.800 align:start position:0%
100% with with the bill sponsor that uh
 
00:44:14.549 --> 00:44:14.559 align:start position:0%
a more comprehensive Maritime strategy
 
00:44:16.750 --> 00:44:16.760 align:start position:0%
is needed to bolster US ship building
 
00:44:18.150 --> 00:44:18.160 align:start position:0%
but there's no dispute that our military
 
00:44:19.510 --> 00:44:19.520 align:start position:0%
leaders have spoken in full-throated
 
00:44:21.910 --> 00:44:21.920 align:start position:0%
support of the Jones act just last year
 
00:44:23.790 --> 00:44:23.800 align:start position:0%
General Jacqueline van oest commander of
 
00:44:26.349 --> 00:44:26.359 align:start position:0%
us Transportation command testified in a
 
00:44:28.589 --> 00:44:28.599 align:start position:0%
US House armed services Committee
 
00:44:30.430 --> 00:44:30.440 align:start position:0%
hearing that the Jones act along with
 
00:44:32.670 --> 00:44:32.680 align:start position:0%
other federal laws and policies ensure
 
00:44:34.390 --> 00:44:34.400 align:start position:0%
that we have the necessary US flag
 
00:44:36.510 --> 00:44:36.520 align:start position:0%
capability and US Mariners during peace
 
00:44:38.309 --> 00:44:38.319 align:start position:0%
time and are ready to move sensitive
 
00:44:40.670 --> 00:44:40.680 align:start position:0%
defense materials during a National
 
00:44:43.069 --> 00:44:43.079 align:start position:0%
Emergency additionally in 2020 a
 
00:44:44.990 --> 00:44:45.000 align:start position:0%
bipartisan group of national lawmakers
 
00:44:47.230 --> 00:44:47.240 align:start position:0%
described the Jones act as an important
 
00:44:49.470 --> 00:44:49.480 align:start position:0%
asset to our military noting that us
 
00:44:51.270 --> 00:44:51.280 align:start position:0%
crude vessels around the world expand
 
00:44:53.150 --> 00:44:53.160 align:start position:0%
our military's Horizon by serving as the
 
00:44:55.270 --> 00:44:55.280 align:start position:0%
eyes and ears of our nation and in
 
00:44:57.470 --> 00:44:57.480 align:start position:0%
keeping our mil milary well supplied
 
00:44:59.109 --> 00:44:59.119 align:start position:0%
losing the Jones act They concluded
 
00:45:00.790 --> 00:45:00.800 align:start position:0%
would hurt our ability to project power
 
00:45:02.470 --> 00:45:02.480 align:start position:0%
during a time of war or National
 
00:45:04.750 --> 00:45:04.760 align:start position:0%
Emergency this is no less true for New
 
00:45:06.870 --> 00:45:06.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire the port of Portsmouth is one
 
00:45:08.270 --> 00:45:08.280 align:start position:0%
of the US Navy's most important
 
00:45:10.390 --> 00:45:10.400 align:start position:0%
operational areas in the country and the
 
00:45:12.030 --> 00:45:12.040 align:start position:0%
Jones act ensures that the Navy can
 
00:45:13.750 --> 00:45:13.760 align:start position:0%
Charter American vessels with American
 
00:45:15.710 --> 00:45:15.720 align:start position:0%
workers both of which are regulated by
 
00:45:17.710 --> 00:45:17.720 align:start position:0%
the US Coast Guard to assist with its
 
00:45:19.910 --> 00:45:19.920 align:start position:0%
operations it also Bears mentioning the
 
00:45:21.710 --> 00:45:21.720 align:start position:0%
Jones act helps preserve a domestic ship
 
00:45:23.069 --> 00:45:23.079 align:start position:0%
building industry and ensures skilled
 
00:45:24.670 --> 00:45:24.680 align:start position:0%
workers in the industrial base needed to
 
00:45:26.710 --> 00:45:26.720 align:start position:0%
ramp up ship building if needed for war
 
00:45:28.710 --> 00:45:28.720 align:start position:0%
including at the poron Naval Shipyard
 
00:45:31.069 --> 00:45:31.079 align:start position:0%
just across the border the importance of
 
00:45:32.710 --> 00:45:32.720 align:start position:0%
the Jones Act of National Security is
 
00:45:34.430 --> 00:45:34.440 align:start position:0%
further highlighted by recent stories
 
00:45:35.510 --> 00:45:35.520 align:start position:0%
you may have seen in the Wall Street
 
00:45:37.790 --> 00:45:37.800 align:start position:0%
Journal uh regarding the possible use of
 
00:45:40.109 --> 00:45:40.119 align:start position:0%
Chinese manufactured Harbor cranes by
 
00:45:41.670 --> 00:45:41.680 align:start position:0%
the Chinese Communist party to gather
 
00:45:43.150 --> 00:45:43.160 align:start position:0%
information about American ports which
 
00:45:44.910 --> 00:45:44.920 align:start position:0%
are some of our most critical pieces of
 
00:45:46.750 --> 00:45:46.760 align:start position:0%
infrastructure weakening of the Jones
 
00:45:47.990 --> 00:45:48.000 align:start position:0%
act would go beyond that allowing
 
00:45:49.390 --> 00:45:49.400 align:start position:0%
foreign Nationals to move products
 
00:45:50.670 --> 00:45:50.680 align:start position:0%
including Dangerous Ones such as
 
00:45:52.589 --> 00:45:52.599 align:start position:0%
petroleum products and fertilizer
 
00:45:53.910 --> 00:45:53.920 align:start position:0%
throughout our nation's extensive
 
00:45:56.150 --> 00:45:56.160 align:start position:0%
Coastal and inland waterways this is
 
00:45:57.750 --> 00:45:57.760 align:start position:0%
just one more reason the Jones act has
 
00:46:00.069 --> 00:46:00.079 align:start position:0%
such strong support from our military I
 
00:46:03.109 --> 00:46:03.119 align:start position:0%
also want to comment briefly um on the
 
00:46:07.190 --> 00:46:07.200 align:start position:0%
protectionist nature of this um the US
 
00:46:09.109 --> 00:46:09.119 align:start position:0%
House select committee on China as well
 
00:46:10.349 --> 00:46:10.359 align:start position:0%
as the Hudson Institute have done a
 
00:46:12.510 --> 00:46:12.520 align:start position:0%
tremendous amount of research on this uh
 
00:46:14.349 --> 00:46:14.359 align:start position:0%
the Chinese government subsidizes ship
 
00:46:15.950 --> 00:46:15.960 align:start position:0%
building to about hundred billion dollar
 
00:46:18.309 --> 00:46:18.319 align:start position:0%
a year and they build ships they don't
 
00:46:21.270 --> 00:46:21.280 align:start position:0%
need sell them at cut rates and uh
 
00:46:23.069 --> 00:46:23.079 align:start position:0%
there's no telling what would happen if
 
00:46:24.630 --> 00:46:24.640 align:start position:0%
our ship building industry dissolved
 
00:46:27.150 --> 00:46:27.160 align:start position:0%
that we needed to move cargo over
 
00:46:29.430 --> 00:46:29.440 align:start position:0%
um if if the Chinese government would
 
00:46:32.549 --> 00:46:32.559 align:start position:0%
simply allow that um to speak to what
 
00:46:34.309 --> 00:46:34.319 align:start position:0%
the resolution States about energy costs
 
00:46:36.109 --> 00:46:36.119 align:start position:0%
I want to share the most recent study
 
00:46:37.750 --> 00:46:37.760 align:start position:0%
done on the impact of the Jones act on
 
00:46:39.470 --> 00:46:39.480 align:start position:0%
us petroleum markets which was completed
 
00:46:40.910 --> 00:46:40.920 align:start position:0%
by the National Bureau for economic
 
00:46:43.069 --> 00:46:43.079 align:start position:0%
research was released just this last
 
00:46:45.230 --> 00:46:45.240 align:start position:0%
December with regard to the New England
 
00:46:46.829 --> 00:46:46.839 align:start position:0%
Market the study found that the Jones
 
00:46:48.510 --> 00:46:48.520 align:start position:0%
act adds
 
00:46:51.470 --> 00:46:51.480 align:start position:0%
.003 to each gallon of gasoline and the
 
00:46:53.190 --> 00:46:53.200 align:start position:0%
results for diesel natural gas and home
 
00:46:55.230 --> 00:46:55.240 align:start position:0%
heating fuel would be comparable in
 
00:46:57.710 --> 00:46:57.720 align:start position:0%
other words the Jones act adds 0.3 cents
 
00:47:00.309 --> 00:47:00.319 align:start position:0%
to a gallon of gas and that study has a
 
00:47:01.589 --> 00:47:01.599 align:start position:0%
fatal flaw that assumes that
 
00:47:03.069 --> 00:47:03.079 align:start position:0%
International carriers would pass that

nominal savings on the consumers rather
 
00:47:07.309 --> 00:47:07.319 align:start position:0%
than pocketed as profit which is what we
 
00:47:08.870 --> 00:47:08.880 align:start position:0%
have seen repeatedly whenever A Jones
 
00:47:11.470 --> 00:47:11.480 align:start position:0%
act waiver has been granted the study
 
00:47:13.030 --> 00:47:13.040 align:start position:0%

among others there's no industry that
 
00:47:22.309 --> 00:47:22.319 align:start position:0%
can do
 
00:47:25.190 --> 00:47:25.200 align:start position:0%
that that 0.3 cents per gallon I
 
00:47:26.790 --> 00:47:26.800 align:start position:0%
mentioned was compared to the costs of
 
00:47:28.990 --> 00:47:29.000 align:start position:0%
crude oil taxes distribution and
 
00:47:31.950 --> 00:47:31.960 align:start position:0%
refining reflects an infimal cost and
 
00:47:33.589 --> 00:47:33.599 align:start position:0%
refutes the resolution's assertion that
 
00:47:35.270 --> 00:47:35.280 align:start position:0%
the Jones act pushes more carbon
 
00:47:37.630 --> 00:47:37.640 align:start position:0%

00:47:39.589 --> 00:47:39.599 align:start position:0%

00:47:41.910 --> 00:47:41.920 align:start position:0%
for any bulk product Maritime shipping
 
00:47:43.230 --> 00:47:43.240 align:start position:0%
is the greenest safest and most
 
00:47:45.750 --> 00:47:45.760 align:start position:0%
cost-effective way to move that product
 
00:47:48.109 --> 00:47:48.119 align:start position:0%

00:47:53.670 --> 00:47:53.680 align:start position:0%

472 Mi by Rail and just 151 Mi by truck
 
00:48:04.230 --> 00:48:04.240 align:start position:0%
I would be remiss if I didn't share that
 
00:48:05.710 --> 00:48:05.720 align:start position:0%
the United States domestic Maritime

in tandem to provide timely delivery of
 
00:48:12.190 --> 00:48:12.200 align:start position:0%
fuel for New Hampshire in 2022 the port
 
00:48:14.230 --> 00:48:14.240 align:start position:0%
of Portsmith saw 96 vessel deliveries of

00:48:18.069 --> 00:48:18.079 align:start position:0%
products amounting to about two arrivals
 
00:48:19.710 --> 00:48:19.720 align:start position:0%
per week totaling millions of barrels of
 
00:48:21.190 --> 00:48:21.200 align:start position:0%
fuel for New Hampshire
 
00:48:23.950 --> 00:48:23.960 align:start position:0%
residents however owing largely to New
 
00:48:25.910 --> 00:48:25.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's proximity to Canada around
 
00:48:28.270 --> 00:48:28.280 align:start position:0%
2third of your fuel comes from Canada
 
00:48:30.109 --> 00:48:30.119 align:start position:0%
from uh Irving's refiner in St John's
 
00:48:30.119 --> 00:48:30.790 align:start position:0%
from uh Irving's refiner in St John's

Brunswick and that's brought in
 
00:48:35.069 --> 00:48:35.079 align:start position:0%
international vessels so nonjon act
 
00:48:38.030 --> 00:48:38.040 align:start position:0%
vessels um so for two-thirds of the fuel
 
00:48:39.270 --> 00:48:39.280 align:start position:0%
you're getting the Jones Act is already
 
00:48:42.109 --> 00:48:42.119 align:start position:0%
not a factor well us vessels have a
 
00:48:43.390 --> 00:48:43.400 align:start position:0%
healthy presence in Portsmouth
 
00:48:44.829 --> 00:48:44.839 align:start position:0%

00:48:46.589 --> 00:48:46.599 align:start position:0%

00:48:48.510 --> 00:48:48.520 align:start position:0%
New England shipyards to support the
 
00:48:50.150 --> 00:48:50.160 align:start position:0%
market it is erroneous to direct
 
00:48:51.750 --> 00:48:51.760 align:start position:0%
concerns over the cost of energy towards
 
00:48:53.190 --> 00:48:53.200 align:start position:0%
the Jones act when two-thirds of New
 
00:48:54.430 --> 00:48:54.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's fuel shipments are made at
 
00:48:56.270 --> 00:48:56.280 align:start position:0%
International vessels
 
00:48:58.549 --> 00:48:58.559 align:start position:0%
indeed hr19 references terminating the
 
00:49:00.190 --> 00:49:00.200 align:start position:0%
Jones act as a way to decrease fuel
 
00:49:01.990 --> 00:49:02.000 align:start position:0%
costs but the cost of shipping has
 
00:49:03.829 --> 00:49:03.839 align:start position:0%
virtually no impact on the cost of fuel
 
00:49:06.390 --> 00:49:06.400 align:start position:0%
to Consumers fuel prices around the
 
00:49:08.349 --> 00:49:08.359 align:start position:0%
world are determined by oil companies
 
00:49:09.990 --> 00:49:10.000 align:start position:0%
and any transportation savings are
 
00:49:12.510 --> 00:49:12.520 align:start position:0%
pocketed by energy traders in short when
 
00:49:14.829 --> 00:49:14.839 align:start position:0%
the Jones Act is waved it is oil Traders
 
00:49:16.589 --> 00:49:16.599 align:start position:0%
not consumers and certainly not American
 
00:49:18.549 --> 00:49:18.559 align:start position:0%
Mariners who benefit there's no reason
 
00:49:19.750 --> 00:49:19.760 align:start position:0%
to believe that terminating the Jones
 
00:49:22.270 --> 00:49:22.280 align:start position:0%
act would have a different result awo
 
00:49:23.789 --> 00:49:23.799 align:start position:0%
members and partner companies are proud
 
00:49:25.069 --> 00:49:25.079 align:start position:0%
to serve the people of New Hampshire as
 
00:49:26.789 --> 00:49:26.799 align:start position:0%
a Frontline industry vital to its supply
 
00:49:28.750 --> 00:49:28.760 align:start position:0%
chain and studies on the impact of the
 
00:49:30.510 --> 00:49:30.520 align:start position:0%
Jones act have repeatedly affirmed its
 
00:49:32.470 --> 00:49:32.480 align:start position:0%
importance to the nation for these
 
00:49:33.870 --> 00:49:33.880 align:start position:0%
reasons we urge this committee to vote
 
00:49:35.829 --> 00:49:35.839 align:start position:0%
against hr19 and remain committed to
 
00:49:37.109 --> 00:49:37.119 align:start position:0%
working with all legislators in New
 
00:49:39.270 --> 00:49:39.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire on Maritime issues I uh I
 
00:49:40.549 --> 00:49:40.559 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your time and
 
00:49:41.870 --> 00:49:41.880 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to answer any questions you
 
00:49:44.109 --> 00:49:44.119 align:start position:0%
have do we have any
 
00:49:46.750 --> 00:49:46.760 align:start position:0%
questions yes representative Manion
 
00:49:48.190 --> 00:49:48.200 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question uh you
 
00:49:49.829 --> 00:49:49.839 align:start position:0%
mentioned the two-thirds comes uh
 
00:49:50.910 --> 00:49:50.920 align:start position:0%
internationally do you think that's a
 
00:49:52.309 --> 00:49:52.319 align:start position:0%
chicken and egg thing like we wouldn't
 
00:49:54.190 --> 00:49:54.200 align:start position:0%
be getting two-thirds if their Jones act
 
00:49:55.670 --> 00:49:55.680 align:start position:0%
didn't exist we would have more domestic
 
00:49:58.630 --> 00:49:58.640 align:start position:0%
trade uh I think in that case um you are
 
00:49:59.990 --> 00:50:00.000 align:start position:0%
much closer to Canada than you are in
 
00:50:01.430 --> 00:50:01.440 align:start position:0%
New York or Philadelphia where the major
 
00:50:03.910 --> 00:50:03.920 align:start position:0%
energy ports are uh in north in in the
 
00:50:05.910 --> 00:50:05.920 align:start position:0%
United States so I think it's it's a uh
 
00:50:06.710 --> 00:50:06.720 align:start position:0%
it's a
 
00:50:10.150 --> 00:50:10.160 align:start position:0%
geographic uh matter and I know uh Mr
 
00:50:11.670 --> 00:50:11.680 align:start position:0%
Moffett mentioned something about
 
00:50:15.230 --> 00:50:15.240 align:start position:0%
product going from Louisiana to Holland
 
00:50:17.270 --> 00:50:17.280 align:start position:0%
back here I I would love to see evidence
 
00:50:20.750 --> 00:50:20.760 align:start position:0%
of that because you know my my testimony
 
00:50:22.230 --> 00:50:22.240 align:start position:0%
uh Bears out and the research Bears out
 
00:50:26.069 --> 00:50:26.079 align:start position:0%
the transportation costs um the the
 
00:50:27.589 --> 00:50:27.599 align:start position:0%
distance you're traveling vastly
 
00:50:29.870 --> 00:50:29.880 align:start position:0%
outweighs the uh the the additional cost
 
00:50:32.670 --> 00:50:32.680 align:start position:0%
that Jones act might might Levy I I have
 
00:50:33.910 --> 00:50:33.920 align:start position:0%
not heard of that and I i' would love to
 
00:50:35.390 --> 00:50:35.400 align:start position:0%
get more information about
 
00:50:37.750 --> 00:50:37.760 align:start position:0%
it any further
 
00:50:40.710 --> 00:50:40.720 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you sir
 
00:50:43.990 --> 00:50:44.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:47.030 --> 00:50:47.040 align:start position:0%
everybody okay next person I like to
 
00:50:52.950 --> 00:50:52.960 align:start position:0%
call up is Andrew St stala is it I'm
 
00:50:56.750 --> 00:50:56.760 align:start position:0%
sure I mispronounced that go correct
 
00:50:59.309 --> 00:50:59.319 align:start position:0%
me could you please uh spell your name
 
00:51:01.630 --> 00:51:01.640 align:start position:0%
for the record yes good morning my name
 
00:51:07.470 --> 00:51:07.480 align:start position:0%
is Andrew strel s r o s a l and I'm an
 
00:51:09.510 --> 00:51:09.520 align:start position:0%
attorney and a former Merchant Mariner
 
00:51:12.309 --> 00:51:12.319 align:start position:0%
from Dover New Hampshire um I'm here
 
00:51:14.990 --> 00:51:15.000 align:start position:0%
today to speak in opposition to hr19 the
 
00:51:17.670 --> 00:51:17.680 align:start position:0%
resolution to repeal the Jones act and
 
00:51:20.630 --> 00:51:20.640 align:start position:0%
also to offer some testimony to previous
 
00:51:23.950 --> 00:51:23.960 align:start position:0%
testimony delivered this morning um
 
00:51:26.270 --> 00:51:26.280 align:start position:0%
listening to Kyle's test Tony he's taken
 
00:51:27.829 --> 00:51:27.839 align:start position:0%
some of the wind out of my sales because
 
00:51:29.670 --> 00:51:29.680 align:start position:0%
we shared many of the same facts and
 
00:51:35.190 --> 00:51:35.200 align:start position:0%
figures um but uh the quote that um
 
00:51:39.390 --> 00:51:39.400 align:start position:0%
fourar General uh van o alast of the
 
00:51:40.630 --> 00:51:40.640 align:start position:0%
commander of United States
 
00:51:44.309 --> 00:51:44.319 align:start position:0%
Transportation command delivered was the
 
00:51:47.309 --> 00:51:47.319 align:start position:0%
Jones act and cargo preference laws work
 
00:51:49.829 --> 00:51:49.839 align:start position:0%
to ensure that we have the necessary US
 
00:51:53.190 --> 00:51:53.200 align:start position:0%
flag capability and US Mariners during
 
00:51:55.789 --> 00:51:55.799 align:start position:0%
peace time and readiness to move
 
00:51:58.150 --> 00:51:58.160 align:start position:0%
sensitive defense material during a
 
00:51:58.160 --> 00:51:59.910 align:start position:0%
sensitive defense material during a
National

00:51:59.910 --> 00:51:59.920 align:start position:0%
National
 
00:52:02.430 --> 00:52:02.440 align:start position:0%
Emergency we rely on Commercial
 
00:52:04.630 --> 00:52:04.640 align:start position:0%
capabilities that enable the Department
 
00:52:07.670 --> 00:52:07.680 align:start position:0%
of Defense joint power projection and
 
00:52:09.710 --> 00:52:09.720 align:start position:0%
highlight the Strategic nature of our
 
00:52:12.829 --> 00:52:12.839 align:start position:0%
shipyards and sea ports as a reason why
 
00:52:15.750 --> 00:52:15.760 align:start position:0%
investments in Grant programs like the
 
00:52:18.190 --> 00:52:18.200 align:start position:0%
port infrastructure development program
 
00:52:19.710 --> 00:52:19.720 align:start position:0%
are essential in expanding
 
00:52:22.710 --> 00:52:22.720 align:start position:0%
Transportation nodes and
 
00:52:24.829 --> 00:52:24.839 align:start position:0%
capacity as I mentioned I'm from dber
 
00:52:26.789 --> 00:52:26.799 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire I'm a graduate of Maine
 
00:52:28.829 --> 00:52:28.839 align:start position:0%
Maritime Academy and I'm the vice
 
00:52:30.710 --> 00:52:30.720 align:start position:0%
president of the main Maritime Academy
 
00:52:33.430 --> 00:52:33.440 align:start position:0%
alumni association I believe uh some
 
00:52:35.510 --> 00:52:35.520 align:start position:0%
graduates from Main Maritime Academy
 
00:52:37.789 --> 00:52:37.799 align:start position:0%
have written to members of the committee
 
00:52:41.750 --> 00:52:41.760 align:start position:0%
and uh submitted um their opinion uh and
 
00:52:45.430 --> 00:52:45.440 align:start position:0%
testimony for you I'm a former Mariner
 
00:52:49.630 --> 00:52:49.640 align:start position:0%
uh I'm master of unlimited tonnage um in
 
00:52:51.990 --> 00:52:52.000 align:start position:0%
rebuttal to some of the testimony today
 
00:52:54.390 --> 00:52:54.400 align:start position:0%
I worked on real ships that ship things
 
00:52:56.710 --> 00:52:56.720 align:start position:0%
that were built in the the United States
 
00:52:59.309 --> 00:52:59.319 align:start position:0%
I'm a plank owner of a us-built ship uh
 
00:53:01.910 --> 00:53:01.920 align:start position:0%
that was built in San Diego California
 
00:53:04.510 --> 00:53:04.520 align:start position:0%
it was about 900 ft long it was an
 
00:53:07.390 --> 00:53:07.400 align:start position:0%
underway replenishment ship I brought
 
00:53:10.309 --> 00:53:10.319 align:start position:0%
food Fuel and ammunition uh to warships
 
00:53:14.549 --> 00:53:14.559 align:start position:0%
at Sea as a US flag Mariner uh those
 
00:53:16.789 --> 00:53:16.799 align:start position:0%
same Mariners are also Jones act
 
00:53:19.270 --> 00:53:19.280 align:start position:0%
Mariners I I was a Jones act Mariner as
 
00:53:22.309 --> 00:53:22.319 align:start position:0%
well uh the the graduates from the
 
00:53:23.950 --> 00:53:23.960 align:start position:0%
maritime is in New England and
 
00:53:26.349 --> 00:53:26.359 align:start position:0%
throughout the country serve as the
 
00:53:29.829 --> 00:53:29.839 align:start position:0%
officers on board these vessels uh they

previously uh the National Bureau of

you raised representative shirtliff
 
00:56:18.630 --> 00:56:18.640 align:start position:0%
earlier um I have personal knowledge
 
00:56:20.589 --> 00:56:20.599 align:start position:0%
that uh regarding the Jones act in
 
00:56:24.349 --> 00:56:24.359 align:start position:0%

2017 uh a few of the American uh
 
00:56:32.349 --> 00:56:32.359 align:start position:0%
carriers the Jones act carriers at
 
00:56:35.309 --> 00:56:35.319 align:start position:0%
service PTO Rico regularly had
 
00:56:38.750 --> 00:56:38.760 align:start position:0%
pre-staged um cargo containers on the
 
00:56:41.270 --> 00:56:41.280 align:start position:0%
ground in Puerto Rico anchored them down
 
00:56:43.710 --> 00:56:43.720 align:start position:0%
to weather the storm so that once the
 
00:56:47.069 --> 00:56:47.079 align:start position:0%
storm had passed there was food and
 
00:56:49.990 --> 00:56:50.000 align:start position:0%
water re readily available for the

people of Puerto
 
00:56:55.390 --> 00:56:55.400 align:start position:0%
Rico because of the Jones Act those
 
00:56:57.029 --> 00:56:57.039 align:start position:0%
carriers regularly service they have a
 
00:56:58.910 --> 00:56:58.920 align:start position:0%
liner service between the mainland and
 
00:57:01.910 --> 00:57:01.920 align:start position:0%
Puerto Rico so they had employees ready
 
00:57:06.069 --> 00:57:06.079 align:start position:0%
to unpack unpack those containers and
 
00:57:08.549 --> 00:57:08.559 align:start position:0%
distribute that uh food and water to the
 
00:57:10.430 --> 00:57:10.440 align:start position:0%
people of Puerto Rico that were in need
 
00:57:14.270 --> 00:57:14.280 align:start position:0%
when the power was out similarly uh the
 
00:57:16.750 --> 00:57:16.760 align:start position:0%
Hawaiian Islands are uh supported by
 
00:57:19.309 --> 00:57:19.319 align:start position:0%
Jones act carriers that provide regular
 
00:57:23.309 --> 00:57:23.319 align:start position:0%
service and uh the leadership of Hawaii
 
00:57:25.750 --> 00:57:25.760 align:start position:0%
recognizes the import
 
00:57:28.549 --> 00:57:28.559 align:start position:0%
of the Jones act so that they have that
 
00:57:30.990 --> 00:57:31.000 align:start position:0%
reliability of service so that their
 
00:57:35.190 --> 00:57:35.200 align:start position:0%
grocery stores have food uh their um gas
 
00:57:38.430 --> 00:57:38.440 align:start position:0%
stations have gasoline and they have
 
00:57:42.150 --> 00:57:42.160 align:start position:0%
really uh available uh fresh water and
 
00:57:46.390 --> 00:57:46.400 align:start position:0%
other food uh needed in case of natural
 
00:57:49.270 --> 00:57:49.280 align:start position:0%
disaster uh it's the reliability of
 
00:57:52.270 --> 00:57:52.280 align:start position:0%
those United States companies United
 
00:57:55.510 --> 00:57:55.520 align:start position:0%
States ships United States Mariners that
 
00:57:57.470 --> 00:57:57.480 align:start position:0%
is so important and why the Jones Act is
 
00:57:59.270 --> 00:57:59.280 align:start position:0%
so important
 
00:58:02.230 --> 00:58:02.240 align:start position:0%
domestically uh I have no nothing to add
 
00:58:08.630 --> 00:58:08.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:10.670 --> 00:58:10.680 align:start position:0%
questions thank you Mr chairman thank
 
00:58:12.270 --> 00:58:12.280 align:start position:0%
you for taking my
 
00:58:15.549 --> 00:58:15.559 align:start position:0%
question uh you mentioned um American
 
00:58:19.109 --> 00:58:19.119 align:start position:0%
shipping taking care of uh the Hawaiian
 
00:58:22.549 --> 00:58:22.559 align:start position:0%
islands and and other Islands uh just
 
00:58:25.069 --> 00:58:25.079 align:start position:0%
curious on my part how did America
 
00:58:27.670 --> 00:58:27.680 align:start position:0%
shipping how what did they do when the
 
00:58:29.510 --> 00:58:29.520 align:start position:0%
Maui had those massive
 
00:58:34.270 --> 00:58:34.280 align:start position:0%
fires I am unaware of what uh personally
 
00:58:36.630 --> 00:58:36.640 align:start position:0%
the the shipping did uh during that I
 
00:58:39.950 --> 00:58:39.960 align:start position:0%
know that um there is regular service to
 
00:58:43.109 --> 00:58:43.119 align:start position:0%
Maui and there are is regular service by
 
00:58:45.950 --> 00:58:45.960 align:start position:0%
Jon act vessels between the Hawaiian
 
00:58:49.190 --> 00:58:49.200 align:start position:0%
Islands so um whether there was support
 
00:58:52.630 --> 00:58:52.640 align:start position:0%
that came from aahu uh the big on over
 
00:58:56.109 --> 00:58:56.119 align:start position:0%
to Maui or there was uh further support
 
00:58:58.710 --> 00:58:58.720 align:start position:0%
from the mainland over to Hawaii and
 
00:59:01.750 --> 00:59:01.760 align:start position:0%
then those um that cargo was distributed
 
00:59:03.750 --> 00:59:03.760 align:start position:0%
between the islands there is regular
 
00:59:07.029 --> 00:59:07.039 align:start position:0%
service in place there that is part of
 
00:59:10.029 --> 00:59:10.039 align:start position:0%
the Jones act to support
 
00:59:13.430 --> 00:59:13.440 align:start position:0%
Maui followup Mr
 
00:59:16.789 --> 00:59:16.799 align:start position:0%
chairman followup Mr
 
00:59:21.150 --> 00:59:21.160 align:start position:0%
chairman absolutely thank you um you
 
00:59:23.589 --> 00:59:23.599 align:start position:0%
talked earlier about the pollution that
 
00:59:27.510 --> 00:59:27.520 align:start position:0%
trains produced that vehicles produce uh
 
00:59:29.630 --> 00:59:29.640 align:start position:0%
ships at Sea I'm a I was a Tin Can
 
00:59:31.910 --> 00:59:31.920 align:start position:0%
Sailor back in the last century so ships
 
00:59:35.470 --> 00:59:35.480 align:start position:0%
at Sea uh routinely pump
 
00:59:39.430 --> 00:59:39.440 align:start position:0%
vges and that lends to the pollution uh
 
00:59:41.789 --> 00:59:41.799 align:start position:0%
do you have any information on how much
 
00:59:45.190 --> 00:59:45.200 align:start position:0%
pollution that would be so um thank you
 
00:59:48.870 --> 00:59:48.880 align:start position:0%
for your service in the tinan fleet um
 
00:59:50.510 --> 00:59:50.520 align:start position:0%
environmental regulations have become
 
00:59:53.470 --> 00:59:53.480 align:start position:0%
much more stringent uh there's uh such
 
00:59:55.630 --> 00:59:55.640 align:start position:0%
things as oily water separators on board
 
00:59:58.710 --> 00:59:58.720 align:start position:0%
vessels and other things but you are not
 
01:00:02.150 --> 01:00:02.160 align:start position:0%
permitted to uh dump Villages overboard
 
01:00:05.109 --> 01:00:05.119 align:start position:0%
uh and so the the environmental
 
01:00:06.630 --> 01:00:06.640 align:start position:0%
regulations both nationally and
 
01:00:09.750 --> 01:00:09.760 align:start position:0%
internationally prevent the um
 
01:00:12.190 --> 01:00:12.200 align:start position:0%
distribution of oil into our oceans and
 
01:00:14.670 --> 01:00:14.680 align:start position:0%
garbage over the side uh so those
 
01:00:17.510 --> 01:00:17.520 align:start position:0%
environmental regulations have been um
 
01:00:20.630 --> 01:00:20.640 align:start position:0%
changed updated and our coasts and our
 
01:00:22.789 --> 01:00:22.799 align:start position:0%
waterways are protected because of it
 
01:00:25.069 --> 01:00:25.079 align:start position:0%
yeah I served in the 60s so I'm sure
 
01:00:25.079 --> 01:00:26.950 align:start position:0%
yeah I served in the 60s so I'm sure
things

01:00:26.950 --> 01:00:26.960 align:start position:0%
things
 
01:00:29.549 --> 01:00:29.559 align:start position:0%
changed yes representative Manion thank
 
01:00:30.710 --> 01:00:30.720 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair thanks for taking my
 
01:00:33.309 --> 01:00:33.319 align:start position:0%
question the uh 0.03 cents that it keeps
 
01:00:35.190 --> 01:00:35.200 align:start position:0%
mentioning is that gasoline and natural
 
01:00:37.029 --> 01:00:37.039 align:start position:0%
gas or just
 
01:00:41.190 --> 01:00:41.200 align:start position:0%
gasoline uh I have according to my facts
 
01:00:42.990 --> 01:00:43.000 align:start position:0%
and figures that I have in front of me
 
01:00:45.549 --> 01:00:45.559 align:start position:0%
it's gasoline okay thank
 
01:00:48.150 --> 01:00:48.160 align:start position:0%
you any further questions yes
 
01:00:49.990 --> 01:00:50.000 align:start position:0%
representative yeah I've had a question
 
01:00:52.390 --> 01:00:52.400 align:start position:0%
all along I'm not sure who can really
 
01:00:54.029 --> 01:00:54.039 align:start position:0%
answer it but it keeps coming up in my
 
01:00:57.750 --> 01:00:57.760 align:start position:0%
mind is is um how much of this is
 
01:01:01.109 --> 01:01:01.119 align:start position:0%
related to like the extra like you know
 
01:01:03.470 --> 01:01:03.480 align:start position:0%
stops and everything are related to the
 
01:01:05.589 --> 01:01:05.599 align:start position:0%
getting the oil to a Refinery than to
 
01:01:09.549 --> 01:01:09.559 align:start position:0%
its destination if anyone knows that
 
01:01:12.630 --> 01:01:12.640 align:start position:0%
possibly um so I'm not sure that that's
 
01:01:15.430 --> 01:01:15.440 align:start position:0%
related to the Jones act the um
 
01:01:18.549 --> 01:01:18.559 align:start position:0%
Logistics of between when the oil is
 
01:01:20.750 --> 01:01:20.760 align:start position:0%
retrieve from the ground to refinement
 
01:01:25.430 --> 01:01:25.440 align:start position:0%
to the gas pump okay all right thank
 
01:01:28.910 --> 01:01:28.920 align:start position:0%
you any further questions seeing none
 
01:01:35.069 --> 01:01:35.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:37.589 --> 01:01:37.599 align:start position:0%
you that say right
 
01:01:39.829 --> 01:01:39.839 align:start position:0%
there okay the next one uh
 
01:01:48.349 --> 01:01:48.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:50.190 --> 01:01:50.200 align:start position:0%
mlof thank you Mr chairman
 
01:01:53.390 --> 01:01:53.400 align:start position:0%
representative Tim MCU from marac
 
01:01:55.390 --> 01:01:55.400 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor of the bill I have written
 
01:01:57.269 --> 01:01:57.279 align:start position:0%
testimony for the clerk I'll give you a
 
01:01:59.430 --> 01:01:59.440 align:start position:0%
copy not going to spend too much time on
 
01:02:01.710 --> 01:02:01.720 align:start position:0%
the written testimony because uh there's
 
01:02:04.269 --> 01:02:04.279 align:start position:0%
been a few folks ahead of me so I'm here
 
01:02:06.710 --> 01:02:06.720 align:start position:0%
to speak for the consumer the consumer
 
01:02:08.789 --> 01:02:08.799 align:start position:0%
that benefits from increased
 
01:02:11.750 --> 01:02:11.760 align:start position:0%
Supply the consumer that benefits from
 
01:02:15.269 --> 01:02:15.279 align:start position:0%
lower cost of goods sold including those
 
01:02:15.279 --> 01:02:16.510 align:start position:0%
lower cost of goods sold including those
shipping

01:02:16.510 --> 01:02:16.520 align:start position:0%
shipping
 
01:02:19.430 --> 01:02:19.440 align:start position:0%
costs so my nephew my oldest nephew was
 
01:02:22.910 --> 01:02:22.920 align:start position:0%
a graduate of Sunni Maritime captain on
 
01:02:24.630 --> 01:02:24.640 align:start position:0%
their football team and an unlimited T
 
01:02:28.430 --> 01:02:28.440 align:start position:0%
Master running inline tugs up and down
 
01:02:32.230 --> 01:02:32.240 align:start position:0%
the coast of San Diego to Alaska
 
01:02:35.589 --> 01:02:35.599 align:start position:0%
Etc my uh one of my older brothers is 40
 
01:02:37.029 --> 01:02:37.039 align:start position:0%
years in the natural gas and oil
 
01:02:39.190 --> 01:02:39.200 align:start position:0%
business out of Houston Texas so as you
 
01:02:40.789 --> 01:02:40.799 align:start position:0%
can imagine this is a topic that we've
 
01:02:43.829 --> 01:02:43.839 align:start position:0%
discussed around an occasional dinner
 
01:02:46.829 --> 01:02:46.839 align:start position:0%
table Gregory's now uh out of that out
 
01:02:47.789 --> 01:02:47.799 align:start position:0%
of that
 
01:02:50.589 --> 01:02:50.599 align:start position:0%
business he saw the issues in in the
 
01:02:53.109 --> 01:02:53.119 align:start position:0%
industry and also saw an opportunity to
 
01:02:55.990 --> 01:02:56.000 align:start position:0%
be a coder like like many folks have
 
01:02:58.430 --> 01:02:58.440 align:start position:0%
done in in California so let me talk a
 
01:03:00.430 --> 01:03:00.440 align:start position:0%
little bit about the simple economics of
 
01:03:04.269 --> 01:03:04.279 align:start position:0%
this is there anyone here that doesn't
 
01:03:06.390 --> 01:03:06.400 align:start position:0%
believe if you increase
 
01:03:09.510 --> 01:03:09.520 align:start position:0%
Supply that that 03 cents which actually
 
01:03:12.589 --> 01:03:12.599 align:start position:0%
is a little larger than that won't come
 
01:03:15.670 --> 01:03:15.680 align:start position:0%
down and it'll be a net decrease to the
 
01:03:17.750 --> 01:03:17.760 align:start position:0%
cost of goods who hasn't seen the
 
01:03:20.349 --> 01:03:20.359 align:start position:0%
hundreds of ships backed up holding your
 
01:03:23.150 --> 01:03:23.160 align:start position:0%
Amazon deliveries or whatever it might
 
01:03:27.190 --> 01:03:27.200 align:start position:0%
be off the coast of pick a port my
 
01:03:28.549 --> 01:03:28.559 align:start position:0%
parents lived in Savannah Georgia for
 
01:03:31.109 --> 01:03:31.119 align:start position:0%
over 20 years busiest port in the
 
01:03:35.109 --> 01:03:35.119 align:start position:0%
country you can see the impact in the
 
01:03:37.789 --> 01:03:37.799 align:start position:0%
bottleneck of the supply chain and this
 
01:03:39.630 --> 01:03:39.640 align:start position:0%
is one of the most basic economic
 
01:03:43.870 --> 01:03:43.880 align:start position:0%
Concepts on the planet increased
 
01:03:46.549 --> 01:03:46.559 align:start position:0%
supply cost will come down increase the
 
01:03:48.309 --> 01:03:48.319 align:start position:0%
cost or decrease the cost of shipping
 
01:03:50.029 --> 01:03:50.039 align:start position:0%
and operating those
 
01:03:52.750 --> 01:03:52.760 align:start position:0%
ships it has nothing to do with our Port
 
01:03:54.990 --> 01:03:55.000 align:start position:0%
security or our ability to enforce
 
01:03:56.950 --> 01:03:56.960 align:start position:0%
National Security we have an incredibly
 
01:04:01.309 --> 01:04:01.319 align:start position:0%
competent military coast guard etc etc
 
01:04:03.069 --> 01:04:03.079 align:start position:0%
I've been on those ships as well by the
 
01:04:05.230 --> 01:04:05.240 align:start position:0%
way I've sold medical devices into those
 
01:04:07.470 --> 01:04:07.480 align:start position:0%
into many of those ships and supplied
 
01:04:11.029 --> 01:04:11.039 align:start position:0%
them off their giant Manual of things
 
01:04:12.630 --> 01:04:12.640 align:start position:0%
that they can order order from I
 
01:04:14.430 --> 01:04:14.440 align:start position:0%
forgotten the name of that huge manual
 
01:04:15.630 --> 01:04:15.640 align:start position:0%
I'm sure the gentleman behind me can
 
01:04:18.309 --> 01:04:18.319 align:start position:0%
tell me tell me so that's really the
 
01:04:19.910 --> 01:04:19.920 align:start position:0%
bottom line on this it's got a little
 
01:04:21.950 --> 01:04:21.960 align:start position:0%
more detailed written testimony but it's
 
01:04:24.470 --> 01:04:24.480 align:start position:0%
a hundredy old Act Right the Merchant
 
01:04:25.950 --> 01:04:25.960 align:start position:0%
Marine Act of
 
01:04:28.069 --> 01:04:28.079 align:start position:0%
1920 and it's
 
01:04:30.990 --> 01:04:31.000 align:start position:0%
archaic we we didn't Envision the kinds
 
01:04:33.789 --> 01:04:33.799 align:start position:0%
of bottlenecks and the need uh and the
 
01:04:35.829 --> 01:04:35.839 align:start position:0%
disruption in the global supply chain
 
01:04:38.630 --> 01:04:38.640 align:start position:0%
that this kind of protectionist act
 
01:04:41.829 --> 01:04:41.839 align:start position:0%
would have a 100 years later at the time
 
01:04:44.309 --> 01:04:44.319 align:start position:0%
it was right on point and probably a lot
 
01:04:46.069 --> 01:04:46.079 align:start position:0%
of for many years since
 
01:04:49.269 --> 01:04:49.279 align:start position:0%
then but now it's a different global
 
01:04:51.510 --> 01:04:51.520 align:start position:0%
economy we have and by the way Senate
 
01:04:53.670 --> 01:04:53.680 align:start position:0%
Bill 102 that came through Commerce
 
01:04:56.549 --> 01:04:56.559 align:start position:0%
which is my primary committee now uh had
 
01:04:58.990 --> 01:04:59.000 align:start position:0%
to do with studying the effects of
 
01:05:01.789 --> 01:05:01.799 align:start position:0%
heating and energy costs and it was a
 
01:05:03.549 --> 01:05:03.559 align:start position:0%
study committee in a budget year that
 
01:05:07.230 --> 01:05:07.240 align:start position:0%
had $250,000 attached to it so three
 
01:05:08.549 --> 01:05:08.559 align:start position:0%
strikes and you're out on that in a
 
01:05:11.069 --> 01:05:11.079 align:start position:0%
budget year house hates well Commerce in
 
01:05:12.269 --> 01:05:12.279 align:start position:0%
particular and the house in general
 
01:05:14.630 --> 01:05:14.640 align:start position:0%
doesn't like study committees we had a
 
01:05:16.829 --> 01:05:16.839 align:start position:0%
special commission to get rid of some of
 
01:05:20.150 --> 01:05:20.160 align:start position:0%
them and the fact is that any chairman
 
01:05:22.430 --> 01:05:22.440 align:start position:0%
as you know Mr chairman can make a study
 
01:05:24.589 --> 01:05:24.599 align:start position:0%
committee without legislation
 
01:05:27.150 --> 01:05:27.160 align:start position:0%
to study any issue so that's why that
 
01:05:29.549 --> 01:05:29.559 align:start position:0%
bill died but it did pass the Senate
 
01:05:30.990 --> 01:05:31.000 align:start position:0%
unanimously because they do happen to
 
01:05:32.269 --> 01:05:32.279 align:start position:0%
like study committees especially when
 
01:05:33.829 --> 01:05:33.839 align:start position:0%
there aren't any Senators on
 
01:05:36.670 --> 01:05:36.680 align:start position:0%
them so that's their habit we send them
 
01:05:37.710 --> 01:05:37.720 align:start position:0%
a study committee they take all the
 
01:05:39.870 --> 01:05:39.880 align:start position:0%
Senate membership off and and I'm sure a
 
01:05:42.069 --> 01:05:42.079 align:start position:0%
former speaker is well aware of
 
01:05:45.950 --> 01:05:45.960 align:start position:0%
that so this is a simply an act or or or
 
01:05:48.990 --> 01:05:49.000 align:start position:0%
an urging of repealing an act to support
 
01:05:51.349 --> 01:05:51.359 align:start position:0%
free trade that ultimately benefits the
 
01:05:53.829 --> 01:05:53.839 align:start position:0%
consumers consumers who I hear time and
 
01:05:56.470 --> 01:05:56.480 align:start position:0%
time again and I say this on almost any
 
01:05:58.990 --> 01:05:59.000 align:start position:0%
Bill like this the most common thing I
 
01:06:00.910 --> 01:06:00.920 align:start position:0%
hear is how are we going to put food on
 
01:06:03.190 --> 01:06:03.200 align:start position:0%
the table and gas in the tank
 
01:06:05.029 --> 01:06:05.039 align:start position:0%
representative shirtliff asked about how
 
01:06:07.710 --> 01:06:07.720 align:start position:0%
does this affect US Virgin Islands well
 
01:06:10.430 --> 01:06:10.440 align:start position:0%
I was fortunate enough to escape to St
 
01:06:12.029 --> 01:06:12.039 align:start position:0%
Thomas for a short time during the
 
01:06:14.789 --> 01:06:14.799 align:start position:0%
height of covid and the biggest shock
 
01:06:18.109 --> 01:06:18.119 align:start position:0%
was $49 a pound for
 
01:06:22.549 --> 01:06:22.559 align:start position:0%
swordfish 70% of the fish in St Thomas
 
01:06:24.910 --> 01:06:24.920 align:start position:0%
is imported I know that seems crazy
 
01:06:26.230 --> 01:06:26.240 align:start position:0%
that's a whole different issue I'll tell
 
01:06:30.150 --> 01:06:30.160 align:start position:0%
tell you about it sometime $14 a pound
 
01:06:32.990 --> 01:06:33.000 align:start position:0%
for butter and I don't mean fancy butter
 
01:06:36.109 --> 01:06:36.119 align:start position:0%
at the tourist Whole Foods I'm talking
 
01:06:39.390 --> 01:06:39.400 align:start position:0%
about the public grocery that's where we
 
01:06:42.069 --> 01:06:42.079 align:start position:0%
would shop we would go I mean it's
 
01:06:43.870 --> 01:06:43.880 align:start position:0%
there's only about three grocery stores
 
01:06:47.390 --> 01:06:47.400 align:start position:0%
major grocery stores uh on that island
 
01:06:50.470 --> 01:06:50.480 align:start position:0%
but $4 a pound for a pound of
 
01:06:53.430 --> 01:06:53.440 align:start position:0%
butter I mean un staggering price
 
01:06:55.390 --> 01:06:55.400 align:start position:0%
staggering prices it's because of that
 
01:06:57.950 --> 01:06:57.960 align:start position:0%
bottleneck and that Monopoly so if you
 
01:07:00.430 --> 01:07:00.440 align:start position:0%
want to do something about that open up
 
01:07:03.029 --> 01:07:03.039 align:start position:0%
free trade break up this Monopoly that
 
01:07:05.269 --> 01:07:05.279 align:start position:0%
has it will have no effect on Port
 
01:07:06.870 --> 01:07:06.880 align:start position:0%
security if you're confident in the
 
01:07:08.670 --> 01:07:08.680 align:start position:0%
ability of our Coast Guard and our
 
01:07:08.680 --> 01:07:10.150 align:start position:0%
ability of our Coast Guard and our
homeland

01:07:10.150 --> 01:07:10.160 align:start position:0%
homeland
 
01:07:12.829 --> 01:07:12.839 align:start position:0%
security urge our Congress to repeal
 
01:07:16.670 --> 01:07:16.680 align:start position:0%
this archaic piece of
 
01:07:18.750 --> 01:07:18.760 align:start position:0%
legislation not sure I can answer any
 
01:07:20.349 --> 01:07:20.359 align:start position:0%
technical questions but I'm happy to
 
01:07:22.910 --> 01:07:22.920 align:start position:0%
answer questions related to my
 
01:07:26.230 --> 01:07:26.240 align:start position:0%
testimony seeing no questions thank you
 
01:07:26.240 --> 01:07:28.630 align:start position:0%
testimony seeing no questions thank you
sir

01:07:28.630 --> 01:07:28.640 align:start position:0%
sir
 
01:07:31.750 --> 01:07:31.760 align:start position:0%
representative got two cards left next
 
01:07:34.269 --> 01:07:34.279 align:start position:0%
one up is all right this is kind of a
 
01:07:37.190 --> 01:07:37.200 align:start position:0%
squiggly line JD and it stats with a be
 
01:07:37.200 --> 01:07:38.670 align:start position:0%
squiggly line JD and it stats with a be
last

01:07:38.670 --> 01:07:38.680 align:start position:0%
last
 
01:07:43.029 --> 01:07:43.039 align:start position:0%
name Bernat okay I see
 
01:07:45.269 --> 01:07:45.279 align:start position:0%
you could you spell your name for the
 
01:07:45.279 --> 01:07:47.789 align:start position:0%
you could you spell your name for the
record

01:07:47.789 --> 01:07:47.799 align:start position:0%
record
 
01:07:53.029 --> 01:07:53.039 align:start position:0%
please yes thank you b r n a r d y I'm
 
01:07:55.470 --> 01:07:55.480 align:start position:0%
uh I represent Rockingham 36 which is
 
01:07:55.480 --> 01:07:56.470 align:start position:0%
uh I represent Rockingham 36 which is
Hampton

01:07:56.470 --> 01:07:56.480 align:start position:0%
Hampton
 
01:07:59.309 --> 01:07:59.319 align:start position:0%
Falls Kensington Southampton Newton and
 
01:08:02.549 --> 01:08:02.559 align:start position:0%
plastow um I wasn't planning to testify
 
01:08:04.870 --> 01:08:04.880 align:start position:0%
but after some of the things I heard I
 
01:08:08.029 --> 01:08:08.039 align:start position:0%
had to step up here I sit on the Science
 
01:08:12.390 --> 01:08:12.400 align:start position:0%
Tech and energy committee um so we deal
 
01:08:15.829 --> 01:08:15.839 align:start position:0%
with those electric costs that uh keep
 
01:08:19.110 --> 01:08:19.120 align:start position:0%
this building warm and uh those those
 
01:08:21.070 --> 01:08:21.080 align:start position:0%
lights on
 
01:08:24.870 --> 01:08:24.880 align:start position:0%
um and it is true as as rep Moffett said
 
01:08:29.110 --> 01:08:29.120 align:start position:0%
that uh it is natural gas which is the
 
01:08:32.950 --> 01:08:32.960 align:start position:0%
primary fuel that's uh providing uh all
 
01:08:35.510 --> 01:08:35.520 align:start position:0%
the all the additional power beyond
 
01:08:37.669 --> 01:08:37.679 align:start position:0%
which comes from uh that which comes
 
01:08:41.070 --> 01:08:41.080 align:start position:0%
from seabook or from Hydro that we have
 
01:08:42.550 --> 01:08:42.560 align:start position:0%
on the Connecticut
 
01:08:45.829 --> 01:08:45.839 align:start position:0%
River uh and because New York and
 
01:08:49.110 --> 01:08:49.120 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts have uh created pipeline
 
01:08:53.829 --> 01:08:53.839 align:start position:0%
bands um we have to get uh the remainder
 
01:08:57.709 --> 01:08:57.719 align:start position:0%
of our natural gas by
 
01:09:00.950 --> 01:09:00.960 align:start position:0%
ship uh so the comments from some of the
 
01:09:03.709 --> 01:09:03.719 align:start position:0%
previous speakers that oil fuel oil and
 
01:09:06.709 --> 01:09:06.719 align:start position:0%
gas come from Canada very well two3
 
01:09:09.189 --> 01:09:09.199 align:start position:0%
two-thirds of it very well may be true
 
01:09:10.990 --> 01:09:11.000 align:start position:0%
that's not the relevant issue the
 
01:09:13.709 --> 01:09:13.719 align:start position:0%
relevant issue is where do we get our
 
01:09:17.070 --> 01:09:17.080 align:start position:0%
natural gas that keeps the electricity
 
01:09:19.990 --> 01:09:20.000 align:start position:0%
on and the natural gas because of the
 
01:09:22.030 --> 01:09:22.040 align:start position:0%
pipeline constraints and because in the
 
01:09:24.430 --> 01:09:24.440 align:start position:0%
winter time uh
 
01:09:27.749 --> 01:09:27.759 align:start position:0%
home heating gets
 
01:09:31.309 --> 01:09:31.319 align:start position:0%
priority the the uh power companies are
 
01:09:34.669 --> 01:09:34.679 align:start position:0%
last in line for what's in that pipeline
 
01:09:38.630 --> 01:09:38.640 align:start position:0%
we have to get that peaking gas uh from
 
01:09:40.709 --> 01:09:40.719 align:start position:0%
uh from Ships coming in and where are
 
01:09:44.430 --> 01:09:44.440 align:start position:0%
they coming from Trinidad and Tobago
 
01:09:48.550 --> 01:09:48.560 align:start position:0%
bringing Venezuelan oil oil Russia or
 
01:09:52.390 --> 01:09:52.400 align:start position:0%
Iran those are the three highest uh
 
01:09:54.990 --> 01:09:55.000 align:start position:0%
company or areas is where we get our oil
 
01:09:58.070 --> 01:09:58.080 align:start position:0%
Mo our natural gas most of it's coming
 
01:09:59.709 --> 01:09:59.719 align:start position:0%
from Trinidad and
 
01:10:02.630 --> 01:10:02.640 align:start position:0%
Tobago it would be much better if we
 
01:10:04.470 --> 01:10:04.480 align:start position:0%
didn't have the Jones act if we could
 
01:10:08.669 --> 01:10:08.679 align:start position:0%
get natural gas from Texas and Louisiana
 
01:10:11.669 --> 01:10:11.679 align:start position:0%
but we can't do that it has to go to
 
01:10:15.350 --> 01:10:15.360 align:start position:0%
some foreign Port first and as rep mafa
 
01:10:17.669 --> 01:10:17.679 align:start position:0%
said most likely it ends up in Europe
 
01:10:19.990 --> 01:10:20.000 align:start position:0%
and then gets trans shipped back
 
01:10:24.709 --> 01:10:24.719 align:start position:0%
here so uh you all experienced a
 
01:10:30.430 --> 01:10:30.440 align:start position:0%
tremendous spike in electric rates uh in
 
01:10:32.390 --> 01:10:32.400 align:start position:0%
July of
 
01:10:37.630 --> 01:10:37.640 align:start position:0%
22 all because of uh what what had G on
 
01:10:39.990 --> 01:10:40.000 align:start position:0%
with the administration shutting down
 
01:10:44.350 --> 01:10:44.360 align:start position:0%
pipeline gas as well as the the war in
 
01:10:48.270 --> 01:10:48.280 align:start position:0%
Ukraine the price of natural gas uh
 
01:10:50.550 --> 01:10:50.560 align:start position:0%
being L having to be liquefied to be
 
01:10:52.630 --> 01:10:52.640 align:start position:0%
carried on a ship which adds to the
 
01:10:55.189 --> 01:10:55.199 align:start position:0%
expense as opposed to be in a pipeline
 
01:10:58.270 --> 01:10:58.280 align:start position:0%
where it isn't liquid doesn't need that
 
01:11:03.510 --> 01:11:03.520 align:start position:0%
uh that extra cost um went from $10 to
 
01:11:10.669 --> 01:11:10.679 align:start position:0%
$72 uh a u mil million BT BTUs um in
 
01:11:13.910 --> 01:11:13.920 align:start position:0%
Europe and we ended up then picking up
 
01:11:15.750 --> 01:11:15.760 align:start position:0%
that Freight New
 
01:11:19.270 --> 01:11:19.280 align:start position:0%
England area suffers because of the lack
 
01:11:21.830 --> 01:11:21.840 align:start position:0%
of pipeline access to natural gas we
 
01:11:24.390 --> 01:11:24.400 align:start position:0%
have to get it by ship and the Jones Act
 
01:11:27.950 --> 01:11:27.960 align:start position:0%
is a real detriment in in that whole
 
01:11:32.350 --> 01:11:32.360 align:start position:0%
process we need to uh move to to make
 
01:11:35.430 --> 01:11:35.440 align:start position:0%
natural gas availability uh much greater
 
01:11:38.110 --> 01:11:38.120 align:start position:0%
than it currently
 
01:11:40.470 --> 01:11:40.480 align:start position:0%
is will you take any
 
01:11:44.270 --> 01:11:44.280 align:start position:0%
questions if I can yes do we have any
 
01:11:52.030 --> 01:11:52.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:54.030 --> 01:11:54.040 align:start position:0%
representative okay down to to our last
 
01:11:58.950 --> 01:11:58.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:01.270 --> 01:12:01.280 align:start position:0%
please thank you Mr chair thank you
 
01:12:03.390 --> 01:12:03.400 align:start position:0%
again members of the committee uh as it
 
01:12:06.310 --> 01:12:06.320 align:start position:0%
happens and I had no inkling of this
 
01:12:08.790 --> 01:12:08.800 align:start position:0%
bill whatsoever as it happens I am a
 
01:12:11.830 --> 01:12:11.840 align:start position:0%
coast guard license 50 gross ton master
 
01:12:14.390 --> 01:12:14.400 align:start position:0%
myself and um I am not taking a position
 
01:12:16.189 --> 01:12:16.199 align:start position:0%
on this bill again didn't even know this
 
01:12:18.990 --> 01:12:19.000 align:start position:0%
bill existed here for other things but I
 
01:12:21.070 --> 01:12:21.080 align:start position:0%
am doing a favor for my brethren in the
 
01:12:22.990 --> 01:12:23.000 align:start position:0%
room and answering a couple questions
 
01:12:24.229 --> 01:12:24.239 align:start position:0%
that went
 
01:12:27.510 --> 01:12:27.520 align:start position:0%
unanswered um the first is regarding the
 
01:12:30.149 --> 01:12:30.159 align:start position:0%
Maui fires and I have a captain friend
 
01:12:33.110 --> 01:12:33.120 align:start position:0%
who works out of lahina in Maui um who I
 
01:12:35.229 --> 01:12:35.239 align:start position:0%
visited a couple of times uh towing
 
01:12:37.550 --> 01:12:37.560 align:start position:0%
companies brought food water baby
 
01:12:39.910 --> 01:12:39.920 align:start position:0%
formula generators and fuel from other
 
01:12:44.430 --> 01:12:44.440 align:start position:0%
Islands to Maui on Jones act vessels uh
 
01:12:46.550 --> 01:12:46.560 align:start position:0%
the other thing that went unanswered is
 
01:12:48.910 --> 01:12:48.920 align:start position:0%
that the Virg uh the Virgin Islands are
 
01:12:51.350 --> 01:12:51.360 align:start position:0%
exempt from the Jones act and there you
 
01:12:54.590 --> 01:12:54.600 align:start position:0%
go that's all I got
 
01:12:56.030 --> 01:12:56.040 align:start position:0%
thank you representative any question
 
01:12:58.510 --> 01:12:58.520 align:start position:0%
vastly outranked in this question I
 
01:13:00.310 --> 01:13:00.320 align:start position:0%
would take questions if but I wouldn't
 
01:13:01.750 --> 01:13:01.760 align:start position:0%
be able to answer them probably do we
 
01:13:04.950 --> 01:13:04.960 align:start position:0%
have any questions seeing none thank you
 
01:13:09.510 --> 01:13:09.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:22.350 --> 01:13:22.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:22.360 --> 01:13:27.189 align:start position:0%
 
forgot

01:13:27.189 --> 01:13:27.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:28.790 --> 01:13:28.800 align:start position:0%
okay in just about a minute or so we
 
01:13:30.510 --> 01:13:30.520 align:start position:0%
will uh we have two more measures this
 
01:13:32.830 --> 01:13:32.840 align:start position:0%
morning they related to Article 5 uh in
 
01:13:52.350 --> 01:13:52.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:52.360 --> 01:14:20.590 align:start position:0%
 
hearing

01:14:20.590 --> 01:14:20.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:20.600 --> 01:14:21.709 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:14:21.709 --> 01:14:21.719 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:14:24.910 --> 01:14:24.920 align:start position:0%
hcr8 house con resolution 8 applying to
 
01:14:27.030 --> 01:14:27.040 align:start position:0%
Congress for a limited national
 
01:14:29.590 --> 01:14:29.600 align:start position:0%
Convention for the exclusive purpose of
 
01:14:31.669 --> 01:14:31.679 align:start position:0%
proposing an amendment to the United
 
01:14:34.270 --> 01:14:34.280 align:start position:0%
States Constitution relative to
 
01:14:37.430 --> 01:14:37.440 align:start position:0%
elections Prime sponsor is here I've
 
01:14:39.910 --> 01:14:39.920 align:start position:0%
seen her uh just a few moments ago
 
01:14:42.229 --> 01:14:42.239 align:start position:0%
representative Reed welcome back thank
 
01:14:44.669 --> 01:14:44.679 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and thank you again uh
 
01:14:48.030 --> 01:14:48.040 align:start position:0%
members of the committee uh at risk of
 
01:14:52.070 --> 01:14:52.080 align:start position:0%
making you sick of my face today um so I
 
01:14:54.669 --> 01:14:54.679 align:start position:0%
not to begin my testimony in a kind of
 
01:14:57.750 --> 01:14:57.760 align:start position:0%
uh bombastic way but uh the United
 
01:14:59.870 --> 01:14:59.880 align:start position:0%
States has frequently been called the
 
01:15:03.030 --> 01:15:03.040 align:start position:0%
great experiment and the reason that is
 
01:15:05.350 --> 01:15:05.360 align:start position:0%
is because at the time that we broke
 
01:15:08.030 --> 01:15:08.040 align:start position:0%
away from England through violence it's
 
01:15:12.510 --> 01:15:12.520 align:start position:0%
worth noting um self-governance was
 
01:15:14.189 --> 01:15:14.199 align:start position:0%
something that had only been done in the
 
01:15:17.470 --> 01:15:17.480 align:start position:0%
distant past and had failed so starting
 
01:15:18.950 --> 01:15:18.960 align:start position:0%
a whole new experiment on
 
01:15:21.110 --> 01:15:21.120 align:start position:0%
self-governance was a pretty radical
 
01:15:23.510 --> 01:15:23.520 align:start position:0%
idea at the time and something we
 
01:15:25.830 --> 01:15:25.840 align:start position:0%
believed passionately in because we had
 
01:15:29.950 --> 01:15:29.960 align:start position:0%
suffered um through a lack of
 
01:15:32.709 --> 01:15:32.719 align:start position:0%
representation and we were willing at
 
01:15:34.470 --> 01:15:34.480 align:start position:0%
after decades and Decades of that to
 
01:15:40.390 --> 01:15:40.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:42.950 --> 01:15:42.960 align:start position:0%
experiment so democracy I need to Define
 
01:15:44.070 --> 01:15:44.080 align:start position:0%
this because sometimes you hear people
 
01:15:45.629 --> 01:15:45.639 align:start position:0%
saying we're not a democracy we're a
 
01:15:46.950 --> 01:15:46.960 align:start position:0%
republic which is a little bit like
 
01:15:48.910 --> 01:15:48.920 align:start position:0%
saying that's not a dog it's a German
 
01:15:51.750 --> 01:15:51.760 align:start position:0%
Shepherd um a republic is a
 
01:15:54.390 --> 01:15:54.400 align:start position:0%
representative democracy as opposed to a
 
01:15:57.149 --> 01:15:57.159 align:start position:0%
direct democracy so democracy is ruled
 
01:15:58.470 --> 01:15:58.480 align:start position:0%
by the people in other words that
 
01:16:01.149 --> 01:16:01.159 align:start position:0%
self-governance that our Founders were
 
01:16:04.590 --> 01:16:04.600 align:start position:0%
striving for um and I have to tell you
 
01:16:06.189 --> 01:16:06.199 align:start position:0%
and you may have already heard because
 
01:16:08.030 --> 01:16:08.040 align:start position:0%
this study is 10 years old but it has
 
01:16:10.350 --> 01:16:10.360 align:start position:0%
been studied in depth as to what level
 
01:16:12.430 --> 01:16:12.440 align:start position:0%
we are a democracy as our Founders
 
01:16:14.270 --> 01:16:14.280 align:start position:0%
wanted us to be and it has been
 
01:16:16.669 --> 01:16:16.679 align:start position:0%
determined that we are actually
 
01:16:20.910 --> 01:16:20.920 align:start position:0%
not functionally not a democracy anymore
 
01:16:24.030 --> 01:16:24.040 align:start position:0%
um there was a famous study over 20
 
01:16:27.910 --> 01:16:27.920 align:start position:0%
years by Northwestern and Princeton um
 
01:16:30.870 --> 01:16:30.880 align:start position:0%
in 2014 that studied 1,800 pieces of
 
01:16:33.070 --> 01:16:33.080 align:start position:0%
legislation on the Congressional level
 
01:16:37.430 --> 01:16:37.440 align:start position:0%
the federal level um and they
 
01:16:41.149 --> 01:16:41.159 align:start position:0%
measured according to what entity wanted
 
01:16:43.590 --> 01:16:43.600 align:start position:0%
a bill to pass or a measure to pass
 
01:16:47.470 --> 01:16:47.480 align:start position:0%
either um moneyed special interests
 
01:16:51.430 --> 01:16:51.440 align:start position:0%
corporations or average citizens and
 
01:16:54.310 --> 01:16:54.320 align:start position:0%
while there was a direct correlation
 
01:16:57.030 --> 01:16:57.040 align:start position:0%
between the will of wealthy special
 
01:16:59.310 --> 01:16:59.320 align:start position:0%
interests and corporations on whether or
 
01:17:01.870 --> 01:17:01.880 align:start position:0%
not a bill passed it was determined and
 
01:17:04.189 --> 01:17:04.199 align:start position:0%
this is a direct quote that the major
 
01:17:06.669 --> 01:17:06.679 align:start position:0%
the majoritarian electorate had quote
 
01:17:10.990 --> 01:17:11.000 align:start position:0%
only a minuscule near zero statistically
 
01:17:14.590 --> 01:17:14.600 align:start position:0%
nonsignificant impact upon public policy
 
01:17:17.430 --> 01:17:17.440 align:start position:0%
the people are not governing we're not
 
01:17:19.470 --> 01:17:19.480 align:start position:0%
in charge of our
 
01:17:21.790 --> 01:17:21.800 align:start position:0%
government and this actually doesn't
 
01:17:25.270 --> 01:17:25.280 align:start position:0%
surprise most people it may surprise
 
01:17:27.270 --> 01:17:27.280 align:start position:0%
people to say that we're not a democracy
 
01:17:29.629 --> 01:17:29.639 align:start position:0%
but it it doesn't really the the effect
 
01:17:31.830 --> 01:17:31.840 align:start position:0%
when you say that we don't impact public
 
01:17:33.950 --> 01:17:33.960 align:start position:0%
policy even though we are the great
 
01:17:36.470 --> 01:17:36.480 align:start position:0%
experiment of democracy in the world
 
01:17:38.550 --> 01:17:38.560 align:start position:0%
people aren't surprised because the
 
01:17:42.430 --> 01:17:42.440 align:start position:0%
people regardless of of party leaning
 
01:17:45.709 --> 01:17:45.719 align:start position:0%
have a deep knowledge over decades
 
01:17:48.310 --> 01:17:48.320 align:start position:0%
now that their government does not
 
01:17:49.910 --> 01:17:49.920 align:start position:0%
respond to
 
01:17:52.590 --> 01:17:52.600 align:start position:0%
them and this is left or right and I you
 
01:17:56.550 --> 01:17:56.560 align:start position:0%
know it risk of you know naming parties
 
01:17:59.470 --> 01:17:59.480 align:start position:0%
from the far right magot people to the
 
01:18:03.870 --> 01:18:03.880 align:start position:0%
farle Bernie people Everyone agrees that
 
01:18:05.629 --> 01:18:05.639 align:start position:0%
the government's not representing us you
 
01:18:07.550 --> 01:18:07.560 align:start position:0%
may have heard of the term income
 
01:18:08.950 --> 01:18:08.960 align:start position:0%
disparity but there's something else
 
01:18:12.030 --> 01:18:12.040 align:start position:0%
called representational disparity and it
 
01:18:14.750 --> 01:18:14.760 align:start position:0%
turns out if you're not one of the
 
01:18:16.790 --> 01:18:16.800 align:start position:0%
Buddies of the powerful if you're not in
 
01:18:18.910 --> 01:18:18.920 align:start position:0%
the very wealthy extremely wealthy
 
01:18:21.229 --> 01:18:21.239 align:start position:0%
billionaire class you're really not
 
01:18:24.709 --> 01:18:24.719 align:start position:0%
getting represented
 
01:18:26.830 --> 01:18:26.840 align:start position:0%
and this has led to increasing levels of
 
01:18:29.149 --> 01:18:29.159 align:start position:0%
civil unrest again both sides it doesn't
 
01:18:31.430 --> 01:18:31.440 align:start position:0%
matter what you believe the solution is
 
01:18:34.350 --> 01:18:34.360 align:start position:0%
on a policy level everyone agrees that
 
01:18:36.270 --> 01:18:36.280 align:start position:0%
we aren't being represented and while
 
01:18:38.669 --> 01:18:38.679 align:start position:0%
the government is not responding to us
 
01:18:41.990 --> 01:18:42.000 align:start position:0%
right or left policies they are
 
01:18:45.310 --> 01:18:45.320 align:start position:0%
responding to their wealthy lobbyists
 
01:18:47.270 --> 01:18:47.280 align:start position:0%
they are responding to their campaign
 
01:18:49.229 --> 01:18:49.239 align:start position:0%
donors they are responding to the
 
01:18:50.910 --> 01:18:50.920 align:start position:0%
billionaires that run the super Pacs
 
01:18:52.910 --> 01:18:52.920 align:start position:0%
that determine elections we all know
 
01:18:52.920 --> 01:18:54.030 align:start position:0%
that determine elections we all know
know

01:18:54.030 --> 01:18:54.040 align:start position:0%
know
 
01:18:58.270 --> 01:18:58.280 align:start position:0%
this so now Article 5 the Constitution
 
01:18:59.629 --> 01:18:59.639 align:start position:0%
the framers of the Constitution and
 
01:19:02.229 --> 01:19:02.239 align:start position:0%
their great wisdom gave us a couple ways
 
01:19:04.149 --> 01:19:04.159 align:start position:0%
to amend the
 
01:19:07.350 --> 01:19:07.360 align:start position:0%
Constitution the first is the one that's
 
01:19:09.669 --> 01:19:09.679 align:start position:0%
we've only ever done successfully which
 
01:19:09.679 --> 01:19:10.910 align:start position:0%
we've only ever done successfully which
is

01:19:10.910 --> 01:19:10.920 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:19:15.390 --> 01:19:15.400 align:start position:0%
congressionally um New Hampshire in 2019
 
01:19:18.310 --> 01:19:18.320 align:start position:0%
because of my bill uh became the 20th
 
01:19:20.950 --> 01:19:20.960 align:start position:0%
State to call for Congressional
 
01:19:23.870 --> 01:19:23.880 align:start position:0%
constitutional amendment to address this
 
01:19:26.629 --> 01:19:26.639 align:start position:0%
issue the issue of money and
 
01:19:29.149 --> 01:19:29.159 align:start position:0%
politics so we're out of options as a
 
01:19:31.229 --> 01:19:31.239 align:start position:0%
state at this point we've done
 
01:19:33.189 --> 01:19:33.199 align:start position:0%
everything we can do to influence
 
01:19:35.030 --> 01:19:35.040 align:start position:0%
Congress to reform itself but the
 
01:19:38.270 --> 01:19:38.280 align:start position:0%
framers knew that power corrupts the
 
01:19:41.310 --> 01:19:41.320 align:start position:0%
framers knew that we can't trust
 
01:19:43.550 --> 01:19:43.560 align:start position:0%
Congress to reform itself we can't trust
 
01:19:45.550 --> 01:19:45.560 align:start position:0%
people in power to reform themselves in
 
01:19:47.669 --> 01:19:47.679 align:start position:0%
general as a principle and so they gave
 
01:19:50.990 --> 01:19:51.000 align:start position:0%
the states the ability to also call for
 
01:19:52.870 --> 01:19:52.880 align:start position:0%
a Constitutional Amendment which you are
 
01:19:55.870 --> 01:19:55.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:59.790 --> 01:19:59.800 align:start position:0%
of so that's the last thing that we have
 
01:20:02.590 --> 01:20:02.600 align:start position:0%
to do except for one and I'll get to
 
01:20:05.110 --> 01:20:05.120 align:start position:0%
that but the arguments you frequently
 
01:20:06.870 --> 01:20:06.880 align:start position:0%
hear against an article five which
 
01:20:08.350 --> 01:20:08.360 align:start position:0%
you've heard many many times in this
 
01:20:10.669 --> 01:20:10.679 align:start position:0%
committee The Runaway
 
01:20:13.669 --> 01:20:13.679 align:start position:0%
convention well as you know it requires
 
01:20:16.629 --> 01:20:16.639 align:start position:0%
a super majority of states to call for a
 
01:20:19.030 --> 01:20:19.040 align:start position:0%
convention it requires a super majority
 
01:20:21.390 --> 01:20:21.400 align:start position:0%
of states to ratify a constitutional
 
01:20:24.070 --> 01:20:24.080 align:start position:0%
amendment that comes out of a convention
 
01:20:26.350 --> 01:20:26.360 align:start position:0%
there's also the question of how can a
 
01:20:27.590 --> 01:20:27.600 align:start position:0%
convention be controlled when
 
01:20:29.149 --> 01:20:29.159 align:start position:0%
conventions set their own rules the
 
01:20:32.030 --> 01:20:32.040 align:start position:0%
rules aren't given to us in the
 
01:20:35.430 --> 01:20:35.440 align:start position:0%
Constitution um and that's why we have
 
01:20:37.910 --> 01:20:37.920 align:start position:0%
delegate instruction bills and if the
 
01:20:40.070 --> 01:20:40.080 align:start position:0%
majority of States followed the lead of
 
01:20:42.550 --> 01:20:42.560 align:start position:0%
this committee last year in passing
 
01:20:44.709 --> 01:20:44.719 align:start position:0%
delegate instruction bills there would
 
01:20:46.790 --> 01:20:46.800 align:start position:0%
be no argument about a runaway
 
01:20:49.870 --> 01:20:49.880 align:start position:0%
convention and so I find it really odd
 
01:20:51.709 --> 01:20:51.719 align:start position:0%
that the same people who
 
01:20:54.790 --> 01:20:54.800 align:start position:0%
will I'll say fearmonger around the idea
 
01:20:56.430 --> 01:20:56.440 align:start position:0%
of a runaway convention are the same
 
01:20:57.990 --> 01:20:58.000 align:start position:0%
people who oppose delicate instruction
 
01:21:01.830 --> 01:21:01.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:04.229 --> 01:21:04.239 align:start position:0%
threat there's also the Strategic
 
01:21:08.110 --> 01:21:08.120 align:start position:0%
element because it's not just we will
 
01:21:10.750 --> 01:21:10.760 align:start position:0%
take control away from Congress and do
 
01:21:13.590 --> 01:21:13.600 align:start position:0%
the amendment ourselves but also we have
 
01:21:15.910 --> 01:21:15.920 align:start position:0%
the power through calling for a
 
01:21:19.390 --> 01:21:19.400 align:start position:0%
convention to force congress's hand to
 
01:21:21.470 --> 01:21:21.480 align:start position:0%
act and that is how in fact we got the
 
01:21:23.149 --> 01:21:23.159 align:start position:0%
17th Amendment which is the direct
 
01:21:25.830 --> 01:21:25.840 align:start position:0%
election of senators it was also
 
01:21:29.110 --> 01:21:29.120 align:start position:0%
influential in getting the Bill of
 
01:21:31.709 --> 01:21:31.719 align:start position:0%
Rights and
 
01:21:33.950 --> 01:21:33.960 align:start position:0%
finally the reason that this really
 
01:21:37.310 --> 01:21:37.320 align:start position:0%
needs to happen when we talk about okay
 
01:21:39.110 --> 01:21:39.120 align:start position:0%
this is scary we haven't done this
 
01:21:42.030 --> 01:21:42.040 align:start position:0%
before we've never actually had uh an
 
01:21:44.629 --> 01:21:44.639 align:start position:0%
amendment convention before why should
 
01:21:45.910 --> 01:21:45.920 align:start position:0%
we do
 
01:21:48.149 --> 01:21:48.159 align:start position:0%
this and it goes back to the civil
 
01:21:50.590 --> 01:21:50.600 align:start position:0%
unrest that that we're experiencing in
 
01:21:52.229 --> 01:21:52.239 align:start position:0%
increasing amounts because everyone
 
01:21:53.669 --> 01:21:53.679 align:start position:0%
across the board knows that this
 
01:21:56.030 --> 01:21:56.040 align:start position:0%
government isn't functioning the way it
 
01:21:58.189 --> 01:21:58.199 align:start position:0%
was designed
 
01:22:00.430 --> 01:22:00.440 align:start position:0%
anyway and the thing is is I look at it
 
01:22:03.070 --> 01:22:03.080 align:start position:0%
like a sick patient we've tried all the
 
01:22:05.430 --> 01:22:05.440 align:start position:0%
conventional medicines when you have a
 
01:22:07.669 --> 01:22:07.679 align:start position:0%
sick patient you try the Tylenol or the
 
01:22:09.470 --> 01:22:09.480 align:start position:0%
antibiotics or whatever you throw
 
01:22:11.270 --> 01:22:11.280 align:start position:0%
whatever you have that's normal and
 
01:22:13.470 --> 01:22:13.480 align:start position:0%
standard and safe and then if the
 
01:22:15.750 --> 01:22:15.760 align:start position:0%
patient isn't responding and it looks
 
01:22:17.189 --> 01:22:17.199 align:start position:0%
like the patient's getting worse and
 
01:22:19.070 --> 01:22:19.080 align:start position:0%
potentially dying well it's time to
 
01:22:21.350 --> 01:22:21.360 align:start position:0%
maybe try something a little bit more
 
01:22:25.470 --> 01:22:25.480 align:start position:0%
experimental now there is an even more
 
01:22:28.270 --> 01:22:28.280 align:start position:0%
dangerous medication and that's actually
 
01:22:30.990 --> 01:22:31.000 align:start position:0%
provided for well in general but
 
01:22:32.270 --> 01:22:32.280 align:start position:0%
specifically in the New Hampshire
 
01:22:34.030 --> 01:22:34.040 align:start position:0%
Constitution Article 10 the right of
 
01:22:37.270 --> 01:22:37.280 align:start position:0%
Revolution which is based on our
 
01:22:39.910 --> 01:22:39.920 align:start position:0%
movement to become a nation to begin
 
01:22:42.550 --> 01:22:42.560 align:start position:0%
with and I know you've all heard it
 
01:22:44.629 --> 01:22:44.639 align:start position:0%
before but I'm going to read it
 
01:22:46.189 --> 01:22:46.199 align:start position:0%
government being instituted for the
 
01:22:48.910 --> 01:22:48.920 align:start position:0%
common benefit protection and security
 
01:22:52.550 --> 01:22:52.560 align:start position:0%
of the whole community and not for the
 
01:22:55.470 --> 01:22:55.480 align:start position:0%
private interest or ment that's
 
01:22:59.390 --> 01:22:59.400 align:start position:0%
profit of any one man family or class of
 
01:23:01.709 --> 01:23:01.719 align:start position:0%
men therefore whenever the ends of
 
01:23:03.669 --> 01:23:03.679 align:start position:0%
government are perverted which we know
 
01:23:05.870 --> 01:23:05.880 align:start position:0%
that they are now and the public Liberty
 
01:23:07.790 --> 01:23:07.800 align:start position:0%
manifestly endangered and all other
 
01:23:10.030 --> 01:23:10.040 align:start position:0%
means of redress are ineffectual this is
 
01:23:12.550 --> 01:23:12.560 align:start position:0%
the last means of
 
01:23:15.910 --> 01:23:15.920 align:start position:0%
redress the people may and of right
 
01:23:19.189 --> 01:23:19.199 align:start position:0%
ought to reform the old or establish a
 
01:23:21.030 --> 01:23:21.040 align:start position:0%
new government the doctrine of
 
01:23:23.470 --> 01:23:23.480 align:start position:0%
non-resistance against arbit power and
 
01:23:26.070 --> 01:23:26.080 align:start position:0%
oppression is absurd slavish and
 
01:23:28.550 --> 01:23:28.560 align:start position:0%
destructive of the good and happiness of
 
01:23:32.390 --> 01:23:32.400 align:start position:0%
mankind and the thing is that in order
 
01:23:35.910 --> 01:23:35.920 align:start position:0%
to prevent that medicine this is the
 
01:23:38.669 --> 01:23:38.679 align:start position:0%
last option we have whether it's to
 
01:23:41.950 --> 01:23:41.960 align:start position:0%
force congress's hand to act would they
 
01:23:43.990 --> 01:23:44.000 align:start position:0%
actually reform themselves I don't know
 
01:23:46.910 --> 01:23:46.920 align:start position:0%
or we go ahead and hold a convention and
 
01:23:48.910 --> 01:23:48.920 align:start position:0%
have those delegate instruction bills
 
01:23:51.870 --> 01:23:51.880 align:start position:0%
but either way we're at that point when
 
01:23:54.470 --> 01:23:54.480 align:start position:0%
we see civil unrest
 
01:23:57.950 --> 01:23:57.960 align:start position:0%
increase um I have experts in the room
 
01:24:00.070 --> 01:24:00.080 align:start position:0%
multiple experts in the room uh
 
01:24:03.030 --> 01:24:03.040 align:start position:0%
recognized National experts on Article 5
 
01:24:05.470 --> 01:24:05.480 align:start position:0%
conventions including experts who helped
 
01:24:06.830 --> 01:24:06.840 align:start position:0%
this committee pass the delegate
 
01:24:10.430 --> 01:24:10.440 align:start position:0%
instruction Bill last year so um I am
 
01:24:13.110 --> 01:24:13.120 align:start position:0%
happy to answer questions but I might
 
01:24:16.629 --> 01:24:16.639 align:start position:0%
defer to better Minds than
 
01:24:18.990 --> 01:24:19.000 align:start position:0%
mine thank you representative for that
 
01:24:21.629 --> 01:24:21.639 align:start position:0%

measure your
 
01:24:27.070 --> 01:24:27.080 align:start position:0%
resolution ACR uh questions for the
 
01:24:27.080 --> 01:24:30.149 align:start position:0%
resolution ACR uh questions for the
prime

01:24:30.149 --> 01:24:30.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:32.870 --> 01:24:32.880 align:start position:0%
sponsor sweet seeing none I do have 10
 
01:24:34.350 --> 01:24:34.360 align:start position:0%
cards here there's a lot of interest in
 
01:24:37.270 --> 01:24:37.280 align:start position:0%
this um seven are in favor three are
 
01:24:39.990 --> 01:24:40.000 align:start position:0%
opposed um I would and we're very glad
 
01:24:42.629 --> 01:24:42.639 align:start position:0%
you're here especially on this cold day
 
01:24:45.709 --> 01:24:45.719 align:start position:0%
and uh your testimony is being recorded
 
01:24:48.310 --> 01:24:48.320 align:start position:0%
uh probably will be out there forever on
 
01:24:51.149 --> 01:24:51.159 align:start position:0%
YouTube immortalized so to speak but I
 
01:24:53.830 --> 01:24:53.840 align:start position:0%
would ask uh especially if if there are
 
01:24:56.709 --> 01:24:56.719 align:start position:0%
seven people in support of the bill um
 
01:24:58.270 --> 01:24:58.280 align:start position:0%
to try to give the committee new
 
01:25:00.510 --> 01:25:00.520 align:start position:0%
information um so that we can keep
 
01:25:03.870 --> 01:25:03.880 align:start position:0%
moving and uh and you don't need to
 
01:25:07.950 --> 01:25:07.960 align:start position:0%
repeat uh unless you really need to uh
 
01:25:10.109 --> 01:25:10.119 align:start position:0%
material has already been said all right
 
01:25:14.270 --> 01:25:14.280 align:start position:0%
uh my next card here is uh JD Bernardi
 
01:25:16.629 --> 01:25:16.639 align:start position:0%
representative Bernardi I recognize the
 
01:25:21.270 --> 01:25:21.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:21.280 --> 01:25:29.950 align:start position:0%
 
representative

01:25:29.950 --> 01:25:29.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:31.750 --> 01:25:31.760 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and and committee
 
01:25:35.830 --> 01:25:35.840 align:start position:0%
again JD Bernardi Rockingham 36 um so
 
01:25:38.629 --> 01:25:38.639 align:start position:0%
just a little bit of of a
 
01:25:42.109 --> 01:25:42.119 align:start position:0%
history in the initial
 
01:25:45.270 --> 01:25:45.280 align:start position:0%
uh preparation of the Constitution James
 
01:25:48.870 --> 01:25:48.880 align:start position:0%
Madison's Virginia Plan was the was the
 
01:25:51.590 --> 01:25:51.600 align:start position:0%
language that was initially discussed
 
01:25:53.430 --> 01:25:53.440 align:start position:0%
for how
 
01:25:57.149 --> 01:25:57.159 align:start position:0%
uh the uh Constitution could be amended
 
01:26:01.270 --> 01:26:01.280 align:start position:0%
which was Congress proposes and States
 
01:26:05.430 --> 01:26:05.440 align:start position:0%
ratify Colonel George Mason made the
 
01:26:07.270 --> 01:26:07.280 align:start position:0%
point and he's the author of the
 
01:26:09.550 --> 01:26:09.560 align:start position:0%
Virginia Declaration of Rights that
 
01:26:12.550 --> 01:26:12.560 align:start position:0%
Congress can abuse its power and refuse
 
01:26:15.550 --> 01:26:15.560 align:start position:0%
to consent to amendments therefore we
 
01:26:18.149 --> 01:26:18.159 align:start position:0%
needed to have the States involved so
 
01:26:18.159 --> 01:26:19.070 align:start position:0%
needed to have the States involved so
Governor

01:26:19.070 --> 01:26:19.080 align:start position:0%
Governor
 
01:26:22.709 --> 01:26:22.719 align:start position:0%
Morris of of Pennsylvania and elge Jerry
 
01:26:26.070 --> 01:26:26.080 align:start position:0%
of Massachusetts created a resolution or
 
01:26:28.990 --> 01:26:29.000 align:start position:0%
an an amendment to that process that
 
01:26:31.990 --> 01:26:32.000 align:start position:0%
proposed that any amendment can also be
 
01:26:35.310 --> 01:26:35.320 align:start position:0%
offered by 2third of the states and then
 
01:26:39.310 --> 01:26:39.320 align:start position:0%
James Wilson of Pennsylvania said uh or
 
01:26:41.669 --> 01:26:41.679 align:start position:0%
added that it need should be ratified
 
01:26:43.590 --> 01:26:43.600 align:start position:0%
not by the states but by three quarters
 
01:26:44.910 --> 01:26:44.920 align:start position:0%
of the
 
01:26:47.750 --> 01:26:47.760 align:start position:0%
states clearing up what kind of majority
 
01:26:49.270 --> 01:26:49.280 align:start position:0%
might be
 
01:26:51.750 --> 01:26:51.760 align:start position:0%
necessary when that amendment was
 
01:26:51.760 --> 01:26:53.030 align:start position:0%
necessary when that amendment was
finally

01:26:53.030 --> 01:26:53.040 align:start position:0%
finally
 
01:26:56.510 --> 01:26:56.520 align:start position:0%
uh created it passed
 
01:27:00.390 --> 01:27:00.400 align:start position:0%
unanimously without any debate it's one
 
01:27:03.510 --> 01:27:03.520 align:start position:0%
of the few issues in the Constitutional
 
01:27:06.550 --> 01:27:06.560 align:start position:0%
Convention that the notes indicate that
 
01:27:11.510 --> 01:27:11.520 align:start position:0%
this process was 100% accepted by the
 
01:27:14.149 --> 01:27:14.159 align:start position:0%
delegates I think that's very important
 
01:27:14.159 --> 01:27:16.149 align:start position:0%
delegates I think that's very important
to

01:27:16.149 --> 01:27:16.159 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:27:18.669 --> 01:27:18.679 align:start position:0%
consider secondly I'd like to add that I
 
01:27:21.350 --> 01:27:21.360 align:start position:0%
had the uh wonderful opportunity along
 
01:27:23.990 --> 01:27:24.000 align:start position:0%
with represent pres of mamea to
 
01:27:27.830 --> 01:27:27.840 align:start position:0%
participate in a uh uh simulated
 
01:27:29.750 --> 01:27:29.760 align:start position:0%
convention last year Convention of
 
01:27:32.470 --> 01:27:32.480 align:start position:0%
states where we looked at three
 
01:27:36.109 --> 01:27:36.119 align:start position:0%
different areas of potential amendments
 
01:27:40.109 --> 01:27:40.119 align:start position:0%
that's term limits or for uh Congress as
 
01:27:44.430 --> 01:27:44.440 align:start position:0%
well as uh members serving in in the uh
 
01:27:48.109 --> 01:27:48.119 align:start position:0%
executive staff uh fiscal restraints
 
01:27:49.950 --> 01:27:49.960 align:start position:0%
largely generally called the Balan
 
01:27:53.229 --> 01:27:53.239 align:start position:0%
budget amendment uh idea and then
 
01:27:55.750 --> 01:27:55.760 align:start position:0%
legislative and executive power
 
01:27:58.229 --> 01:27:58.239 align:start position:0%
limitations so we divided into three
 
01:28:00.870 --> 01:28:00.880 align:start position:0%
committees or three groups and we worked
 
01:28:03.629 --> 01:28:03.639 align:start position:0%
on our amendments that we thought might
 
01:28:06.070 --> 01:28:06.080 align:start position:0%
be appropriate in those
 
01:28:09.550 --> 01:28:09.560 align:start position:0%
areas we didn't run away we didn't go
 
01:28:12.430 --> 01:28:12.440 align:start position:0%
off scope we stayed on target we
 
01:28:15.430 --> 01:28:15.440 align:start position:0%
presented a group of amendments that
 
01:28:18.629 --> 01:28:18.639 align:start position:0%
were focused on the specific area that
 
01:28:21.390 --> 01:28:21.400 align:start position:0%
we were tasked to deal with and
 
01:28:24.390 --> 01:28:24.400 align:start position:0%
presented those to the uh to the
 
01:28:27.629 --> 01:28:27.639 align:start position:0%
Congress as a whole and that group was
 
01:28:31.109 --> 01:28:31.119 align:start position:0%
composed of people just like you and me
 
01:28:33.590 --> 01:28:33.600 align:start position:0%
and representative mamila these were
 
01:28:36.189 --> 01:28:36.199 align:start position:0%
representatives from the various States
 
01:28:39.350 --> 01:28:39.360 align:start position:0%
that's exactly how a convention Article
 
01:28:42.629 --> 01:28:42.639 align:start position:0%
5 convention would operate and work and
 
01:28:45.109 --> 01:28:45.119 align:start position:0%
and to believe that it's going to be
 
01:28:48.149 --> 01:28:48.159 align:start position:0%
some craz runaway event and and we're
 
01:28:50.109 --> 01:28:50.119 align:start position:0%
going to throw out the Constitution
 
01:28:52.030 --> 01:28:52.040 align:start position:0%
we're going to decide that we're we're
 
01:28:55.870 --> 01:28:55.880 align:start position:0%
going to uh uh eliminate the Second
 
01:28:58.950 --> 01:28:58.960 align:start position:0%
Amendment and whatnot is that is not the
 
01:29:01.590 --> 01:29:01.600 align:start position:0%
kind of activity that was ever discussed
 
01:29:04.790 --> 01:29:04.800 align:start position:0%
or ever even considered we stayed
 
01:29:07.430 --> 01:29:07.440 align:start position:0%
entirely focused on the issues that were
 
01:29:10.390 --> 01:29:10.400 align:start position:0%
in front of us now this bill asks us to
 
01:29:12.550 --> 01:29:12.560 align:start position:0%
look at or this resolution asks us to
 
01:29:15.109 --> 01:29:15.119 align:start position:0%
look at free and fair elections so some
 
01:29:18.629 --> 01:29:18.639 align:start position:0%
of the major items that that the public
 
01:29:21.270 --> 01:29:21.280 align:start position:0%
is concerned with are are issues like
 
01:29:22.590 --> 01:29:22.600 align:start position:0%
voter IDE
 
01:29:24.830 --> 01:29:24.840 align:start position:0%
should we have absentee ballots what are
 
01:29:26.390 --> 01:29:26.400 align:start position:0%
the constraints on that should we have
 
01:29:26.400 --> 01:29:27.830 align:start position:0%
the constraints on that should we have
voter

01:29:27.830 --> 01:29:27.840 align:start position:0%
voter
 
01:29:31.550 --> 01:29:31.560 align:start position:0%
harvesting there it would be useful in
 
01:29:33.790 --> 01:29:33.800 align:start position:0%
the United States to get some consensus
 
01:29:36.790 --> 01:29:36.800 align:start position:0%
on this and drive to the ability to have
 
01:29:39.189 --> 01:29:39.199 align:start position:0%
free and fair elections or elections
 
01:29:41.390 --> 01:29:41.400 align:start position:0%
that our public believes are freeer and
 
01:29:45.950 --> 01:29:45.960 align:start position:0%
fair so I support the process I support
 
01:29:48.310 --> 01:29:48.320 align:start position:0%
this uh this resolution and willing to
 
01:29:49.669 --> 01:29:49.679 align:start position:0%
take any
 
01:29:51.590 --> 01:29:51.600 align:start position:0%
questions thank you representative
 
01:29:56.030 --> 01:29:56.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:59.030 --> 01:29:59.040 align:start position:0%
Bernardi seeing none thank you so much
 
01:30:01.350 --> 01:30:01.360 align:start position:0%
for that uh
 
01:30:03.470 --> 01:30:03.480 align:start position:0%
testimony uh another representative who
 
01:30:04.910 --> 01:30:04.920 align:start position:0%
is here who opposes the bill is
 
01:30:07.109 --> 01:30:07.119 align:start position:0%
representative Granger welcome
 
01:30:19.669 --> 01:30:19.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:22.550 --> 01:30:22.560 align:start position:0%
back thank you uh thanks for having me
 
01:30:25.629 --> 01:30:25.639 align:start position:0%
back so I was planning to come here in
 
01:30:28.149 --> 01:30:28.159 align:start position:0%
favor of uh hcr9 but I didn't know there
 
01:30:31.229 --> 01:30:31.239 align:start position:0%
were two uh Article 5 convention bills
 
01:30:33.590 --> 01:30:33.600 align:start position:0%
here today um I'll so I'll try to keep
 
01:30:35.510 --> 01:30:35.520 align:start position:0%
it brief so I don't have to restate the
 
01:30:37.270 --> 01:30:37.280 align:start position:0%
same thing twice in two different pieces
 
01:30:37.280 --> 01:30:38.149 align:start position:0%
same thing twice in two different pieces
of

01:30:38.149 --> 01:30:38.159 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:30:40.470 --> 01:30:40.480 align:start position:0%
testimony the idea that there are
 
01:30:43.629 --> 01:30:43.639 align:start position:0%
Article 5 convention experts is simply
 
01:30:46.910 --> 01:30:46.920 align:start position:0%
false there is no such thing as an
 
01:30:49.430 --> 01:30:49.440 align:start position:0%
article 5 convention expert because
 
01:30:51.390 --> 01:30:51.400 align:start position:0%
there has never been an article 5
 
01:30:51.400 --> 01:30:52.590 align:start position:0%
there has never been an article 5
convention

01:30:52.590 --> 01:30:52.600 align:start position:0%
convention
 
01:30:55.109 --> 01:30:55.119 align:start position:0%
what the Constitution says about Article
 
01:30:57.990 --> 01:30:58.000 align:start position:0%
5 conventions is about amendments in
 
01:31:00.510 --> 01:31:00.520 align:start position:0%
general and it says the Congress
 
01:31:01.990 --> 01:31:02.000 align:start position:0%
whenever two-thirds of both houses shall
 
01:31:03.790 --> 01:31:03.800 align:start position:0%
deem it necessary shall propose
 
01:31:06.229 --> 01:31:06.239 align:start position:0%
amendments to this Constitution that
 
01:31:08.430 --> 01:31:08.440 align:start position:0%
doesn't have to do with a con a
 
01:31:10.550 --> 01:31:10.560 align:start position:0%
Convention of states or a constitutional
 
01:31:12.790 --> 01:31:12.800 align:start position:0%
convention or on the application of the
 
01:31:14.830 --> 01:31:14.840 align:start position:0%
legislatures of 2third of the several
 
01:31:16.830 --> 01:31:16.840 align:start position:0%
States okay that's probably that's what
 
01:31:18.109 --> 01:31:18.119 align:start position:0%
we're actually talking about so there's
 
01:31:19.149 --> 01:31:19.159 align:start position:0%
a sentence about what we're talking
 
01:31:20.709 --> 01:31:20.719 align:start position:0%
about shall call a convention for
 
01:31:22.590 --> 01:31:22.600 align:start position:0%
proposing amendments which either case
 
01:31:24.229 --> 01:31:24.239 align:start position:0%
shall be valid to all intents and
 
01:31:25.750 --> 01:31:25.760 align:start position:0%
purposes as part of this constitution
 
01:31:27.390 --> 01:31:27.400 align:start position:0%
when ratified by the legislatur of three
 
01:31:28.709 --> 01:31:28.719 align:start position:0%
fours of the several States or by
 
01:31:31.350 --> 01:31:31.360 align:start position:0%
conventions of three fours thereof okay
 
01:31:33.629 --> 01:31:33.639 align:start position:0%
that does not tell you how the delegates
 
01:31:36.590 --> 01:31:36.600 align:start position:0%
are selected that does not tell you what
 
01:31:39.470 --> 01:31:39.480 align:start position:0%
their goals are and it doesn't tell you
 
01:31:42.070 --> 01:31:42.080 align:start position:0%
how the actual process will work um
 
01:31:44.109 --> 01:31:44.119 align:start position:0%
other parts of the Constitution sort of
 
01:31:46.470 --> 01:31:46.480 align:start position:0%
take effect there Congress determines
 
01:31:48.629 --> 01:31:48.639 align:start position:0%
how the delegates are elected they could
 
01:31:51.030 --> 01:31:51.040 align:start position:0%
have special elections and every state
 
01:31:52.470 --> 01:31:52.480 align:start position:0%
to select the delegates to this
 
01:31:54.550 --> 01:31:54.560 align:start position:0%
Constitutional Convention they could
 
01:31:56.790 --> 01:31:56.800 align:start position:0%
decide that the ranking Senator is the
 
01:31:58.270 --> 01:31:58.280 align:start position:0%
Delegate for the constitutional
 
01:32:00.310 --> 01:32:00.320 align:start position:0%
convention uh they could just say the
 
01:32:02.189 --> 01:32:02.199 align:start position:0%
Speaker of the House of every state
 
01:32:04.830 --> 01:32:04.840 align:start position:0%
house is the is the delegate they could
 
01:32:06.709 --> 01:32:06.719 align:start position:0%
do whatever they want their Congress and
 
01:32:09.470 --> 01:32:09.480 align:start position:0%
their job at this point is to facilitate
 
01:32:10.830 --> 01:32:10.840 align:start position:0%
getting the Constitutional Convention
 
01:32:12.590 --> 01:32:12.600 align:start position:0%
underway you may have heard this called
 
01:32:14.189 --> 01:32:14.199 align:start position:0%
the convention of states and supporters
 
01:32:16.270 --> 01:32:16.280 align:start position:0%
of the of uh con of Article 5
 
01:32:18.229 --> 01:32:18.239 align:start position:0%
conventions will generally call it a
 
01:32:20.149 --> 01:32:20.159 align:start position:0%
Convention of states it is not a
 
01:32:22.310 --> 01:32:22.320 align:start position:0%
Convention of states the states have
 
01:32:25.590 --> 01:32:25.600 align:start position:0%
zero ability to control what happens at
 
01:32:27.270 --> 01:32:27.280 align:start position:0%
these conventions and the reason they
 
01:32:29.189 --> 01:32:29.199 align:start position:0%
don't have any ability to control what
 
01:32:31.590 --> 01:32:31.600 align:start position:0%
happens at these conventions is because
 
01:32:33.910 --> 01:32:33.920 align:start position:0%
the authority of the delegates does not
 
01:32:36.790 --> 01:32:36.800 align:start position:0%
come from the legislature the authority
 
01:32:40.790 --> 01:32:40.800 align:start position:0%
of the delegates comes directly from the
 
01:32:44.390 --> 01:32:44.400 align:start position:0%
people so what does that mean exactly so
 
01:32:45.750 --> 01:32:45.760 align:start position:0%
this country was not founded by the
 
01:32:47.270 --> 01:32:47.280 align:start position:0%
Constitution it existed before the
 
01:32:50.070 --> 01:32:50.080 align:start position:0%
current US Constitution it was the
 
01:32:52.590 --> 01:32:52.600 align:start position:0%
Declaration of Independence said what
 
01:32:54.149 --> 01:32:54.159 align:start position:0%
this country feels is the right way
 
01:32:56.109 --> 01:32:56.119 align:start position:0%
where government actually comes from we
 
01:32:57.350 --> 01:32:57.360 align:start position:0%
hold these truths to be self-evident
 
01:32:58.709 --> 01:32:58.719 align:start position:0%
that all men are created equal that they
 
01:32:59.790 --> 01:32:59.800 align:start position:0%
are endowed by their creator with
 
01:33:01.149 --> 01:33:01.159 align:start position:0%
certain unalienable rights that among
 
01:33:02.270 --> 01:33:02.280 align:start position:0%
these are life liberty and the proce of
 
01:33:04.350 --> 01:33:04.360 align:start position:0%
happiness you all learned that in school
 
01:33:06.030 --> 01:33:06.040 align:start position:0%
that to secure these rights governments
 
01:33:08.310 --> 01:33:08.320 align:start position:0%
are instituted among men deriving their
 
01:33:10.070 --> 01:33:10.080 align:start position:0%
just powers from the consent of the
 
01:33:12.550 --> 01:33:12.560 align:start position:0%
governor governed that whenever any form
 
01:33:14.030 --> 01:33:14.040 align:start position:0%
of government becomes destructive to the
 
01:33:16.390 --> 01:33:16.400 align:start position:0%
ends it's the right of the people the
 
01:33:18.950 --> 01:33:18.960 align:start position:0%
people not the legislators to alter or
 
01:33:20.550 --> 01:33:20.560 align:start position:0%
to abolish it and Institute a new
 
01:33:23.310 --> 01:33:23.320 align:start position:0%
government okay so what does that mean
 
01:33:25.030 --> 01:33:25.040 align:start position:0%
that means that the constitution we
 
01:33:28.310 --> 01:33:28.320 align:start position:0%
currently have now is authorized by the
 
01:33:30.310 --> 01:33:30.320 align:start position:0%
people all right and that and the
 
01:33:32.070 --> 01:33:32.080 align:start position:0%
historical precedent for this is the
 
01:33:34.149 --> 01:33:34.159 align:start position:0%
Articles of Confederation being replaced
 
01:33:36.830 --> 01:33:36.840 align:start position:0%
by the Constitution so when this current
 
01:33:38.750 --> 01:33:38.760 align:start position:0%
constitution was put into place it had
 
01:33:39.870 --> 01:33:39.880 align:start position:0%
to go to the various States for
 
01:33:41.870 --> 01:33:41.880 align:start position:0%
ratification all right and the
 
01:33:44.149 --> 01:33:44.159 align:start position:0%
justification that and at the time Rhode
 
01:33:46.750 --> 01:33:46.760 align:start position:0%
Island did not attend the convention
 
01:33:47.709 --> 01:33:47.719 align:start position:0%
here's some information about the
 
01:33:49.189 --> 01:33:49.199 align:start position:0%
Articles of Confederation you might find
 
01:33:50.510 --> 01:33:50.520 align:start position:0%
interesting the Articles of
 
01:33:52.189 --> 01:33:52.199 align:start position:0%
Confederation was much more more strict
 
01:33:53.870 --> 01:33:53.880 align:start position:0%
on amendments than the current
 
01:33:55.750 --> 01:33:55.760 align:start position:0%
constitution is in order to amend the
 
01:33:57.270 --> 01:33:57.280 align:start position:0%
Articles of Confederation back when
 
01:34:00.189 --> 01:34:00.199 align:start position:0%
there were 13 members you needed to have
 
01:34:03.390 --> 01:34:03.400 align:start position:0%
a unanimous approval of all the states
 
01:34:06.229 --> 01:34:06.239 align:start position:0%
all 13 states needed to be on board to
 
01:34:08.550 --> 01:34:08.560 align:start position:0%
make amendments or to alter or abolish
 
01:34:10.070 --> 01:34:10.080 align:start position:0%
the existing Constitution which was the
 
01:34:12.189 --> 01:34:12.199 align:start position:0%
Articles of the Confederation Rhode
 
01:34:13.910 --> 01:34:13.920 align:start position:0%
Island boycotted the Constitutional
 
01:34:16.390 --> 01:34:16.400 align:start position:0%
Convention it was impossible for them to
 
01:34:19.470 --> 01:34:19.480 align:start position:0%
have any unanimity unanimity on that so
 
01:34:21.950 --> 01:34:21.960 align:start position:0%
what they did instead was they defined a
 
01:34:24.390 --> 01:34:24.400 align:start position:0%
new ratification
 
01:34:26.790 --> 01:34:26.800 align:start position:0%
process and that's what would happen if
 
01:34:28.830 --> 01:34:28.840 align:start position:0%
we have another article 5 today the new
 
01:34:30.910 --> 01:34:30.920 align:start position:0%
ratification process was defined in the
 
01:34:33.510 --> 01:34:33.520 align:start position:0%
Constitution and they just needed three4
 
01:34:35.709 --> 01:34:35.719 align:start position:0%
or 2/3 one of those they needed a
 
01:34:38.270 --> 01:34:38.280 align:start position:0%
certain number it wasn't unanimous New
 
01:34:39.990 --> 01:34:40.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire was the last of the 13
 
01:34:42.390 --> 01:34:42.400 align:start position:0%
colonies that triggered the ratification
 
01:34:44.550 --> 01:34:44.560 align:start position:0%
um the old ratification process was
 
01:34:47.189 --> 01:34:47.199 align:start position:0%
ignored entirely uh because it didn't
 
01:34:48.550 --> 01:34:48.560 align:start position:0%
matter what does that mean well that
 
01:34:49.750 --> 01:34:49.760 align:start position:0%
means that in our nation it is
 
01:34:51.109 --> 01:34:51.119 align:start position:0%
precedented for a constitutional
 
01:34:53.270 --> 01:34:53.280 align:start position:0%
convention to have the new constitution
 
01:34:56.030 --> 01:34:56.040 align:start position:0%
Define the ratification process so this
 
01:34:58.350 --> 01:34:58.360 align:start position:0%
means that if you come if they come out
 
01:34:59.910 --> 01:34:59.920 align:start position:0%
with some new Constitution which is well
 
01:35:02.149 --> 01:35:02.159 align:start position:0%
within their rights that ratification
 
01:35:03.990 --> 01:35:04.000 align:start position:0%
process defined in the new constitution
 
01:35:06.070 --> 01:35:06.080 align:start position:0%
takes precedent all right so they can
 
01:35:07.590 --> 01:35:07.600 align:start position:0%
send that out to the states and they
 
01:35:09.310 --> 01:35:09.320 align:start position:0%
could say well let's just have special
 
01:35:13.109 --> 01:35:13.119 align:start position:0%
elections in every state and if 50 plus
 
01:35:15.870 --> 01:35:15.880 align:start position:0%
one of the people decide to ratify the
 
01:35:17.830 --> 01:35:17.840 align:start position:0%
Constitution then it's valid all right
 
01:35:20.070 --> 01:35:20.080 align:start position:0%
so any claims that a certain number of
 
01:35:22.750 --> 01:35:22.760 align:start position:0%
states need to ratify this Con stion not
 
01:35:25.470 --> 01:35:25.480 align:start position:0%
not supported by history because uh
 
01:35:27.830 --> 01:35:27.840 align:start position:0%
interesting T tidbit my district uh
 
01:35:30.070 --> 01:35:30.080 align:start position:0%
which was at the time northern Rochester
 
01:35:32.350 --> 01:35:32.360 align:start position:0%
um uh which is still northern Rochester
 
01:35:34.510 --> 01:35:34.520 align:start position:0%
is in my district but Milton didn't
 
01:35:37.109 --> 01:35:37.119 align:start position:0%
exist as a town back then uh they voted
 
01:35:38.950 --> 01:35:38.960 align:start position:0%
against the new constitution now they on
 
01:35:41.109 --> 01:35:41.119 align:start position:0%
their own are not capable of you know if
 
01:35:42.270 --> 01:35:42.280 align:start position:0%
they were the only ones they wouldn't be
 
01:35:43.590 --> 01:35:43.600 align:start position:0%
able to say nope Constitution doesn't
 
01:35:44.830 --> 01:35:44.840 align:start position:0%
apply it would need to be the states the
 
01:35:47.109 --> 01:35:47.119 align:start position:0%
state would have to uh a single state
 
01:35:49.189 --> 01:35:49.199 align:start position:0%
would need to not ratify the
 
01:35:51.709 --> 01:35:51.719 align:start position:0%
Constitution under the old scheme but uh
 
01:35:53.310 --> 01:35:53.320 align:start position:0%
that's just interesting that uh they
 
01:35:57.350 --> 01:35:57.360 align:start position:0%
didn't like it so the other claim is one
 
01:36:01.470 --> 01:36:01.480 align:start position:0%
of the other popular claims is that I
 
01:36:02.110 --> 01:36:02.120 align:start position:0%
have it written
 
01:36:02.120 --> 01:36:04.149 align:start position:0%
have it written
[Music]

01:36:04.149 --> 01:36:04.159 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:36:07.830 --> 01:36:07.840 align:start position:0%
here all right so states can put in
 
01:36:10.109 --> 01:36:10.119 align:start position:0%
legislation that limits what delegates
 
01:36:13.590 --> 01:36:13.600 align:start position:0%
can do this is not possible at all
 
01:36:15.910 --> 01:36:15.920 align:start position:0%
because the delegates outrank the
 
01:36:18.390 --> 01:36:18.400 align:start position:0%
legislator because the delegates derive
 
01:36:20.590 --> 01:36:20.600 align:start position:0%
their just power from the people the
 
01:36:23.870 --> 01:36:23.880 align:start position:0%
legislator derive their power from the
 
01:36:26.109 --> 01:36:26.119 align:start position:0%
Constitution so what does that mean that
 
01:36:27.510 --> 01:36:27.520 align:start position:0%
means let's say we make a rule saying
 
01:36:29.070 --> 01:36:29.080 align:start position:0%
you can only make this amendment this
 
01:36:30.149 --> 01:36:30.159 align:start position:0%
amendment this amendment you are not
 
01:36:31.430 --> 01:36:31.440 align:start position:0%
allowed to stray outside those
 
01:36:33.470 --> 01:36:33.480 align:start position:0%
boundaries well they can just ignore
 
01:36:35.070 --> 01:36:35.080 align:start position:0%
that you might as well have a peasant
 
01:36:36.750 --> 01:36:36.760 align:start position:0%
telling a king a sovereign that they are
 
01:36:39.109 --> 01:36:39.119 align:start position:0%
not allowed to do whatever they want the
 
01:36:42.390 --> 01:36:42.400 align:start position:0%
king is not is is not something that is
 
01:36:44.430 --> 01:36:44.440 align:start position:0%
going to listen to something that a
 
01:36:46.430 --> 01:36:46.440 align:start position:0%
peasant says and we are as legislators
 
01:36:48.270 --> 01:36:48.280 align:start position:0%
are mere peasants compared to a delegate
 
01:36:50.109 --> 01:36:50.119 align:start position:0%
a delegate has Supreme Sovereign
 
01:36:52.990 --> 01:36:53.000 align:start position:0%
authority to write what whatever they
 
01:36:56.229 --> 01:36:56.239 align:start position:0%
want all right so the Constitution we
 
01:36:57.950 --> 01:36:57.960 align:start position:0%
currently have just to make this point
 
01:36:59.310 --> 01:36:59.320 align:start position:0%
clear in case there's any confusion the
 
01:37:01.229 --> 01:37:01.239 align:start position:0%
Constitution that we currently have
 
01:37:03.790 --> 01:37:03.800 align:start position:0%
authorizes legislator all right the
 
01:37:06.990 --> 01:37:07.000 align:start position:0%
legislator get their power from the
 
01:37:08.750 --> 01:37:08.760 align:start position:0%
Constitution all right the either the
 
01:37:10.030 --> 01:37:10.040 align:start position:0%
state legislature or the federal
 
01:37:12.870 --> 01:37:12.880 align:start position:0%
legislature all right we are bound by
 
01:37:15.350 --> 01:37:15.360 align:start position:0%
that Constitution to follow certain
 
01:37:18.310 --> 01:37:18.320 align:start position:0%
rules the delegates do not get their
 
01:37:20.430 --> 01:37:20.440 align:start position:0%
just powers from the Constitution that
 
01:37:22.629 --> 01:37:22.639 align:start position:0%
means that the Supreme court has no
 
01:37:25.229 --> 01:37:25.239 align:start position:0%
bearing whatsoever on their actions
 
01:37:28.070 --> 01:37:28.080 align:start position:0%
there is no way to limit their actions
 
01:37:30.430 --> 01:37:30.440 align:start position:0%
at convention they could simply put in
 
01:37:32.550 --> 01:37:32.560 align:start position:0%
the new constitution delegates cannot be
 
01:37:34.070 --> 01:37:34.080 align:start position:0%
held responsible for the things they do
 
01:37:36.350 --> 01:37:36.360 align:start position:0%
in convention and then bam whatever new
 
01:37:38.430 --> 01:37:38.440 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court they come up with um
 
01:37:40.189 --> 01:37:40.199 align:start position:0%
whether it's the uh modification of the
 
01:37:41.550 --> 01:37:41.560 align:start position:0%
current Supreme Court or whatever else
 
01:37:44.270 --> 01:37:44.280 align:start position:0%
the case may be uh suddenly is now uh
 
01:37:46.430 --> 01:37:46.440 align:start position:0%
Banning States from enforcing their
 
01:37:49.070 --> 01:37:49.080 align:start position:0%
actions there's basically no way you can
 
01:37:50.870 --> 01:37:50.880 align:start position:0%
control the me convention the purpose of
 
01:37:53.229 --> 01:37:53.239 align:start position:0%
article Article 5 uh or at least when it
 
01:37:55.470 --> 01:37:55.480 align:start position:0%
comes to Article 5 conventions is to
 
01:37:57.550 --> 01:37:57.560 align:start position:0%
allow us to totally abolish the
 
01:38:00.390 --> 01:38:00.400 align:start position:0%
Constitution if such a need arises that
 
01:38:02.550 --> 01:38:02.560 align:start position:0%
is the function and if you doubt this
 
01:38:04.149 --> 01:38:04.159 align:start position:0%
then where in the current then you
 
01:38:06.189 --> 01:38:06.199 align:start position:0%
should ask yourself where in the current
 
01:38:08.629 --> 01:38:08.639 align:start position:0%
constitution does it allow the people to
 
01:38:11.350 --> 01:38:11.360 align:start position:0%
totally abolish their form of government
 
01:38:13.229 --> 01:38:13.239 align:start position:0%
because the founders knew that it was
 
01:38:15.149 --> 01:38:15.159 align:start position:0%
very important that people the people
 
01:38:16.830 --> 01:38:16.840 align:start position:0%
would be allowed to abolish their
 
01:38:19.229 --> 01:38:19.239 align:start position:0%
government and Institute a new one they
 
01:38:21.910 --> 01:38:21.920 align:start position:0%
put in an a mechanism to allow us to do
 
01:38:23.790 --> 01:38:23.800 align:start position:0%
that because well they were
 
01:38:27.510 --> 01:38:27.520 align:start position:0%
revolutionary sorts all right Article 5
 
01:38:29.750 --> 01:38:29.760 align:start position:0%
is how they actually go about abolishing
 
01:38:32.629 --> 01:38:32.639 align:start position:0%
the current Constitution and to assume
 
01:38:34.629 --> 01:38:34.639 align:start position:0%
that we have any level of control it do
 
01:38:37.310 --> 01:38:37.320 align:start position:0%
and to drive this point home it could be
 
01:38:40.430 --> 01:38:40.440 align:start position:0%
anything it could be any bill you want I
 
01:38:42.589 --> 01:38:42.599 align:start position:0%
dis you maybe you disagree with me on
 
01:38:44.550 --> 01:38:44.560 align:start position:0%
this I really don't like the 16th
 
01:38:47.390 --> 01:38:47.400 align:start position:0%
Amendment it authorizes an income tax if
 
01:38:49.870 --> 01:38:49.880 align:start position:0%
there was a bill to or a house
 
01:38:51.830 --> 01:38:51.840 align:start position:0%
resolution to authorize an Article 5
 
01:38:54.550 --> 01:38:54.560 align:start position:0%
convention to get rid of the income tax
 
01:38:56.390 --> 01:38:56.400 align:start position:0%
I would have to say no to that extremely
 
01:38:56.400 --> 01:38:57.750 align:start position:0%
I would have to say no to that extremely
juicy

01:38:57.750 --> 01:38:57.760 align:start position:0%
juicy
 
01:38:59.910 --> 01:38:59.920 align:start position:0%
carrot anybody who knows me knows how
 
01:39:03.189 --> 01:39:03.199 align:start position:0%
much I hate income taxes so it it
 
01:39:05.030 --> 01:39:05.040 align:start position:0%
doesn't matter how good the juice is it
 
01:39:06.830 --> 01:39:06.840 align:start position:0%
doesn't matter because the point isn't
 
01:39:10.750 --> 01:39:10.760 align:start position:0%
to get that actual policy passed a lot
 
01:39:12.589 --> 01:39:12.599 align:start position:0%
of times the policy is simply to get an
 
01:39:15.109 --> 01:39:15.119 align:start position:0%
article 5 convention maybe we just
 
01:39:16.470 --> 01:39:16.480 align:start position:0%
shouldn't get rid of the Constitution
 
01:39:18.189 --> 01:39:18.199 align:start position:0%
maybe we should just keep it as is it is
 
01:39:20.070 --> 01:39:20.080 align:start position:0%
the oldest document that oldest
 
01:39:21.629 --> 01:39:21.639 align:start position:0%
constitution that's still around we
 
01:39:23.149 --> 01:39:23.159 align:start position:0%
should probably keep it that way thank
 
01:39:24.830 --> 01:39:24.840 align:start position:0%
you I am available for
 
01:39:28.189 --> 01:39:28.199 align:start position:0%

01:39:30.550 --> 01:39:30.560 align:start position:0%
questions at this time seeing none at
 
01:39:32.830 --> 01:39:32.840 align:start position:0%

uh our committee before um in favor of
 
01:40:05.510 --> 01:40:05.520 align:start position:0%
an article 5 convention I want to point
 
01:40:06.990 --> 01:40:07.000 align:start position:0%
out a couple things the language of the
 
01:40:09.030 --> 01:40:09.040 align:start position:0%
bill I could direct your attention to
 
01:40:13.629 --> 01:40:13.639 align:start position:0%
lines 23 through 28 the state of New
 
01:40:16.589 --> 01:40:16.599 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh desires that the delegates
 
01:40:18.229 --> 01:40:18.239 align:start position:0%
to said convention shall be comprised
 
01:40:20.270 --> 01:40:20.280 align:start position:0%
equally of individuals currently
 
01:40:25.030 --> 01:40:25.040 align:start position:0%
currently elected a state and uh uh uh
 
01:40:28.229 --> 01:40:28.239 align:start position:0%
local office or be selected by election
 
01:40:30.270 --> 01:40:30.280 align:start position:0%
in each Congressional
 
01:40:30.280 --> 01:40:32.430 align:start position:0%
in each Congressional
uh

01:40:32.430 --> 01:40:32.440 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:40:34.830 --> 01:40:34.840 align:start position:0%
uh yes thank you for the purpose of
 
01:40:36.390 --> 01:40:36.400 align:start position:0%
serving as a delegate though all
 
01:40:37.950 --> 01:40:37.960 align:start position:0%
individuals elected or appointed to
 
01:40:39.950 --> 01:40:39.960 align:start position:0%
federal office now or in the past be
 
01:40:44.109 --> 01:40:44.119 align:start position:0%
prohibited from serving as a as a um a
 
01:40:46.030 --> 01:40:46.040 align:start position:0%
delegate to the convention and intends
 
01:40:48.510 --> 01:40:48.520 align:start position:0%
to retain the ability to restrict or
 
01:40:50.629 --> 01:40:50.639 align:start position:0%
expand the power of delegates within uh
 
01:40:53.430 --> 01:40:53.440 align:start position:0%
the limits expressed so
 
01:40:55.750 --> 01:40:55.760 align:start position:0%
basically what we're talking about is is
 
01:40:58.550 --> 01:40:58.560 align:start position:0%
a specific topic for Article 5
 
01:40:59.950 --> 01:40:59.960 align:start position:0%
convention it's not to rewrite the
 
01:41:02.790 --> 01:41:02.800 align:start position:0%
Constitution it's not to create uh a new
 
01:41:04.830 --> 01:41:04.840 align:start position:0%
power structure in America it's simply
 
01:41:07.390 --> 01:41:07.400 align:start position:0%
to to limit the scope of the convention
 
01:41:09.350 --> 01:41:09.360 align:start position:0%
to the issue of our elections in this
 
01:41:11.350 --> 01:41:11.360 align:start position:0%
country I want to point out a few things
 
01:41:11.360 --> 01:41:12.229 align:start position:0%
country I want to point out a few things
to

01:41:12.229 --> 01:41:12.239 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:41:15.910 --> 01:41:15.920 align:start position:0%
you um unless you live under Iraq which
 
01:41:17.350 --> 01:41:17.360 align:start position:0%
we don't because we're all serving in
 
01:41:19.109 --> 01:41:19.119 align:start position:0%
the government we know that voters are
 
01:41:22.550 --> 01:41:22.560 align:start position:0%
losing faith in the system
 
01:41:24.270 --> 01:41:24.280 align:start position:0%
it doesn't make sense to me that we
 
01:41:26.470 --> 01:41:26.480 align:start position:0%
don't do anything except continue to
 
01:41:28.350 --> 01:41:28.360 align:start position:0%
complain about the problems in the
 
01:41:31.149 --> 01:41:31.159 align:start position:0%
system we keep electing the same wrong
 
01:41:33.510 --> 01:41:33.520 align:start position:0%
people to office who use their office
 
01:41:37.149 --> 01:41:37.159 align:start position:0%
for um personal gain and increasingly
 
01:41:38.589 --> 01:41:38.599 align:start position:0%
the political class in America is
 
01:41:40.990 --> 01:41:41.000 align:start position:0%
turning into a plutocracy where we have
 
01:41:43.510 --> 01:41:43.520 align:start position:0%
a separate elitist group of people who
 
01:41:45.030 --> 01:41:45.040 align:start position:0%
decides what happens to the rest of the
 
01:41:48.510 --> 01:41:48.520 align:start position:0%
country to the you know to the uh uh uh
 
01:41:50.189 --> 01:41:50.199 align:start position:0%
the detriment of the rest of the states
 
01:41:52.589 --> 01:41:52.599 align:start position:0%
and the people who elected people um to
 
01:41:55.030 --> 01:41:55.040 align:start position:0%
to Congress we have a duty to protect
 
01:41:56.830 --> 01:41:56.840 align:start position:0%
the Electoral Integrity not just in New
 
01:41:58.470 --> 01:41:58.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but you know for the entire
 
01:42:00.350 --> 01:42:00.360 align:start position:0%
country if we continue to allow
 
01:42:02.830 --> 01:42:02.840 align:start position:0%
corporations and special interest groups
 
01:42:04.629 --> 01:42:04.639 align:start position:0%
to retain power in America and have a
 
01:42:08.669 --> 01:42:08.679 align:start position:0%
say over our public policy then uh we
 
01:42:11.470 --> 01:42:11.480 align:start position:0%
don't have any power to protect anybody
 
01:42:14.430 --> 01:42:14.440 align:start position:0%
you know we're we're simply just a stop
 
01:42:18.070 --> 01:42:18.080 align:start position:0%
Gap in between um the increases in power
 
01:42:19.629 --> 01:42:19.639 align:start position:0%
that we see in our federal
 
01:42:22.990 --> 01:42:23.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:25.430 --> 01:42:25.440 align:start position:0%
we're we're seeing more of a partisan
 
01:42:27.629 --> 01:42:27.639 align:start position:0%
divide which is based on electoral
 
01:42:29.830 --> 01:42:29.840 align:start position:0%
Monopoly I've only having a two-party
 
01:42:31.990 --> 01:42:32.000 align:start position:0%
system that we we you know simply just
 
01:42:33.910 --> 01:42:33.920 align:start position:0%
need to admit is not going to continue
 
01:42:36.270 --> 01:42:36.280 align:start position:0%
to work for the future we're almost $40
 
01:42:39.550 --> 01:42:39.560 align:start position:0%
trillion in debt is an unfathomable it's
 
01:42:41.750 --> 01:42:41.760 align:start position:0%
an unfathomable amount of money that we
 
01:42:44.270 --> 01:42:44.280 align:start position:0%
will never be able to pay off and as
 
01:42:46.149 --> 01:42:46.159 align:start position:0%
long as that keeps increasing our
 
01:42:48.830 --> 01:42:48.840 align:start position:0%
economy is going to fail we have to stop
 
01:42:51.109 --> 01:42:51.119 align:start position:0%
electing people that continuously spend
 
01:42:53.229 --> 01:42:53.239 align:start position:0%
our money with no regard for you know
 
01:42:56.070 --> 01:42:56.080 align:start position:0%
for the future the reason I co-sponsored
 
01:42:59.310 --> 01:42:59.320 align:start position:0%
this uh convention bill was that we have
 
01:43:03.510 --> 01:43:03.520 align:start position:0%
too much influence of bad powerful money
 
01:43:07.149 --> 01:43:07.159 align:start position:0%
in the um in the electoral process and
 
01:43:09.270 --> 01:43:09.280 align:start position:0%
the only way to change that is to Force
 
01:43:12.350 --> 01:43:12.360 align:start position:0%
congress's Hand by saying as a state we
 
01:43:14.350 --> 01:43:14.360 align:start position:0%
no longer going to put up with this crap
 
01:43:16.470 --> 01:43:16.480 align:start position:0%
we want to we want to do something about
 
01:43:18.350 --> 01:43:18.360 align:start position:0%
it here's what we
 
01:43:21.229 --> 01:43:21.239 align:start position:0%
propose um it's not to weapon
 
01:43:23.109 --> 01:43:23.119 align:start position:0%
the the the convention against any other
 
01:43:25.790 --> 01:43:25.800 align:start position:0%
partisan group it's not it's not to to
 
01:43:29.030 --> 01:43:29.040 align:start position:0%
re you know to abolish or or to uh
 
01:43:31.550 --> 01:43:31.560 align:start position:0%
create a new you know a new government
 
01:43:33.109 --> 01:43:33.119 align:start position:0%
that is simply going to continue to do
 
01:43:34.669 --> 01:43:34.679 align:start position:0%
the same things that's happening now
 
01:43:37.030 --> 01:43:37.040 align:start position:0%
we're specifically talking
 
01:43:41.709 --> 01:43:41.719 align:start position:0%
about uh the electoral process in
 
01:43:44.470 --> 01:43:44.480 align:start position:0%
itself um I I've heard I've heard things
 
01:43:46.430 --> 01:43:46.440 align:start position:0%
about if we were to allow a convention
 
01:43:48.629 --> 01:43:48.639 align:start position:0%
to go through that they would change the
 
01:43:50.189 --> 01:43:50.199 align:start position:0%
Second Amendment we would no longer have
 
01:43:52.990 --> 01:43:53.000 align:start position:0%
our rights to you know to um to defend
 
01:43:54.910 --> 01:43:54.920 align:start position:0%
ourselves or our property or our family
 
01:43:57.510 --> 01:43:57.520 align:start position:0%
and friends which isn't true because
 
01:44:00.990 --> 01:44:01.000 align:start position:0%
these uh this HCR and and other Article
 
01:44:03.910 --> 01:44:03.920 align:start position:0%
5 um uh things that we've had in the
 
01:44:06.070 --> 01:44:06.080 align:start position:0%
past are are are limited in scope
 
01:44:10.229 --> 01:44:10.239 align:start position:0%
specifically to certain um issues so
 
01:44:13.830 --> 01:44:13.840 align:start position:0%
we're only talking about an exclusive
 
01:44:17.310 --> 01:44:17.320 align:start position:0%
topic um the point of a convention is to
 
01:44:20.270 --> 01:44:20.280 align:start position:0%
propose uh reforms to force the federal
 
01:44:22.589 --> 01:44:22.599 align:start position:0%
government to acques to the states based
 
01:44:25.510 --> 01:44:25.520 align:start position:0%
on our 10th Amendment right which is the
 
01:44:28.109 --> 01:44:28.119 align:start position:0%
the the foundation of why I personally
 
01:44:30.030 --> 01:44:30.040 align:start position:0%
continue to sponsor Article 5 convention
 
01:44:31.709 --> 01:44:31.719 align:start position:0%
bills because I believe in that power of
 
01:44:33.550 --> 01:44:33.560 align:start position:0%
the 10th Amendment for us as a as a
 
01:44:35.910 --> 01:44:35.920 align:start position:0%
sovereign state to say you know Congress
 
01:44:38.709 --> 01:44:38.719 align:start position:0%
is not do you know doing their job uh
 
01:44:41.189 --> 01:44:41.199 align:start position:0%
they keep spending our money you know
 
01:44:43.430 --> 01:44:43.440 align:start position:0%
putting us in foreign conflicts without
 
01:44:46.870 --> 01:44:46.880 align:start position:0%
um you know Congress uh saying that we
 
01:44:51.070 --> 01:44:51.080 align:start position:0%
can you know uh legally excuse me
 
01:44:53.830 --> 01:44:53.840 align:start position:0%
and uh we're we're not going to put up
 
01:44:57.270 --> 01:44:57.280 align:start position:0%
with them sucking anymore so uh I guess
 
01:44:59.070 --> 01:44:59.080 align:start position:0%
with that I will take any questions if
 
01:45:00.229 --> 01:45:00.239 align:start position:0%
you have
 
01:45:04.350 --> 01:45:04.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:07.189 --> 01:45:07.199 align:start position:0%
questions and saying none uh I thank you

01:45:54.750 --> 01:45:54.760 align:start position:0%
I bring some good news um on Friday we
 
01:45:56.790 --> 01:45:56.800 align:start position:0%
had a article 5 resolution actually a
 
01:46:00.709 --> 01:46:00.719 align:start position:0%
resolution passed the um veterans and
 
01:46:02.870 --> 01:46:02.880 align:start position:0%
legal Affairs committee it's a unique
 
01:46:05.149 --> 01:46:05.159 align:start position:0%
resolution it's an article 5 application
 
01:46:08.070 --> 01:46:08.080 align:start position:0%
for congressional terms as well as a
 
01:46:10.189 --> 01:46:10.199 align:start position:0%
separate Article 5 application for this
 
01:46:12.790 --> 01:46:12.800 align:start position:0%
subject matter right here today and it
 
01:46:16.229 --> 01:46:16.239 align:start position:0%
passed bipartisan supports it had eight
 
01:46:18.470 --> 01:46:18.480 align:start position:0%
sponsors on the resolution four
 
01:46:20.470 --> 01:46:20.480 align:start position:0%
Democrats four Republicans and it passed
 
01:46:23.669 --> 01:46:23.679 align:start position:0%
pass the committee by an 8 to5 vote for
 
01:46:27.830 --> 01:46:27.840 align:start position:0%
Republicans for Democrats so that is
 
01:46:30.750 --> 01:46:30.760 align:start position:0%
nice to see people coming together to
 
01:46:32.589 --> 01:46:32.599 align:start position:0%
try to solve some of these major
 
01:46:36.149 --> 01:46:36.159 align:start position:0%
problems in our country and um I know I
 
01:46:40.870 --> 01:46:40.880 align:start position:0%
don't tout myself as a expert I think I
 
01:46:44.470 --> 01:46:44.480 align:start position:0%
know Article 5 fairly well um I do have
 
01:46:47.350 --> 01:46:47.360 align:start position:0%
a document here from a true expert
 
01:46:50.709 --> 01:46:50.719 align:start position:0%
Michael Ferris and um the information I
 
01:46:53.070 --> 01:46:53.080 align:start position:0%
heard from the previous speaker and
 
01:46:55.550 --> 01:46:55.560 align:start position:0%
against as you probably saw he didn't
 
01:46:58.189 --> 01:46:58.199 align:start position:0%
offer one shred of evidence because
 
01:46:59.790 --> 01:46:59.800 align:start position:0%
everything that he said against the
 
01:47:01.750 --> 01:47:01.760 align:start position:0%
Article 5 convention he cannot back up
 
01:47:05.750 --> 01:47:05.760 align:start position:0%
with any facts um what I will provide to
 
01:47:07.790 --> 01:47:07.800 align:start position:0%
you in a
 
01:47:11.550 --> 01:47:11.560 align:start position:0%
document is virtually every that has
 
01:47:13.350 --> 01:47:13.360 align:start position:0%
been stated against an article 5
 
01:47:16.350 --> 01:47:16.360 align:start position:0%
convention is the actual original Source
 
01:47:18.030 --> 01:47:18.040 align:start position:0%
documents from the
 
01:47:21.109 --> 01:47:21.119 align:start position:0%
framers refuting the Char charge that
 
01:47:22.470 --> 01:47:22.480 align:start position:0%
they have no control over the
 
01:47:25.950 --> 01:47:25.960 align:start position:0%
legislature in fact I have a document
 
01:47:28.390 --> 01:47:28.400 align:start position:0%
from the main State Legislature
 
01:47:30.350 --> 01:47:30.360 align:start position:0%
1861 it's a
 
01:47:33.790 --> 01:47:33.800 align:start position:0%
commission it's the commission to send
 
01:47:36.030 --> 01:47:36.040 align:start position:0%
delegates to the Washington peace
 
01:47:38.990 --> 01:47:39.000 align:start position:0%
conference which was a true and official
 
01:47:41.109 --> 01:47:41.119 align:start position:0%
Convention of the States called by the
 
01:47:42.149 --> 01:47:42.159 align:start position:0%
state of
 
01:47:45.310 --> 01:47:45.320 align:start position:0%
Virginia to address the issue of slavery
 
01:47:47.270 --> 01:47:47.280 align:start position:0%
to propose amendments to the US
 
01:47:49.470 --> 01:47:49.480 align:start position:0%
Constitution in that commission it
 
01:47:52.870 --> 01:47:52.880 align:start position:0%
states that the Commissioners are under
 
01:47:56.229 --> 01:47:56.239 align:start position:0%
control at all times by the state
 
01:47:59.470 --> 01:47:59.480 align:start position:0%
legislature all times the state
 
01:48:01.870 --> 01:48:01.880 align:start position:0%
legislators control their delegates or
 
01:48:05.030 --> 01:48:05.040 align:start position:0%
their Commissioners in fact in 2020 the
 
01:48:07.870 --> 01:48:07.880 align:start position:0%
US Supreme Court had a UNAM decision in
 
01:48:11.430 --> 01:48:11.440 align:start position:0%
the shfo versus Washington case where
 
01:48:14.350 --> 01:48:14.360 align:start position:0%
the state legislators control the
 
01:48:17.430 --> 01:48:17.440 align:start position:0%
Electoral delegates to electoral
 
01:48:21.470 --> 01:48:21.480 align:start position:0%
college that they are bound by their
 
01:48:24.870 --> 01:48:24.880 align:start position:0%
pledge that pledge and that decision
 
01:48:27.430 --> 01:48:27.440 align:start position:0%
obviously applies to any commissioner
 
01:48:30.910 --> 01:48:30.920 align:start position:0%
appointed by the state legislatures so
 
01:48:33.830 --> 01:48:33.840 align:start position:0%
this idea that they do not represent you
 
01:48:36.470 --> 01:48:36.480 align:start position:0%
is completely unfounded it's not based
 
01:48:39.390 --> 01:48:39.400 align:start position:0%
upon our history it's not a based upon
 
01:48:43.070 --> 01:48:43.080 align:start position:0%
laws and it's not a based upon our
 
01:48:44.790 --> 01:48:44.800 align:start position:0%
overwhelming precedent and of
 
01:48:47.189 --> 01:48:47.199 align:start position:0%
conventions in the past in fact this
 
01:48:48.629 --> 01:48:48.639 align:start position:0%
year right now your legislature your
 
01:48:51.430 --> 01:48:51.440 align:start position:0%
Senate just passed a bill
 
01:48:53.750 --> 01:48:53.760 align:start position:0%
um I have the number I I'm not going to
 
01:48:58.270 --> 01:48:58.280 align:start position:0%
pull it up uh this year it was this bill
 
01:49:00.189 --> 01:49:00.199 align:start position:0%
has to do with real estate law it came
 
01:49:02.189 --> 01:49:02.199 align:start position:0%
from a an official Convention of the
 
01:49:03.669 --> 01:49:03.679 align:start position:0%
States known as the uniform law
 
01:49:06.270 --> 01:49:06.280 align:start position:0%
commission so you are already using this
 
01:49:08.310 --> 01:49:08.320 align:start position:0%
process I know you've heard me say this
 
01:49:10.790 --> 01:49:10.800 align:start position:0%
in the past but you're actually using
 
01:49:13.669 --> 01:49:13.679 align:start position:0%
the process now that convention meets
 
01:49:14.910 --> 01:49:14.920 align:start position:0%
once a
 
01:49:17.870 --> 01:49:17.880 align:start position:0%
year the states in New Hampshire your
 
01:49:19.550 --> 01:49:19.560 align:start position:0%
Governor appoints the Commissioners but
 
01:49:21.070 --> 01:49:21.080 align:start position:0%
most of the states are appointed by the
 
01:49:21.080 --> 01:49:21.870 align:start position:0%
most of the states are appointed by the
state

01:49:21.870 --> 01:49:21.880 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:49:24.870 --> 01:49:24.880 align:start position:0%
legislatures it's a limited convention
 
01:49:28.629 --> 01:49:28.639 align:start position:0%
on prub subjects um subjects that they
 
01:49:31.189 --> 01:49:31.199 align:start position:0%
determine ahead of time it's one state
 
01:49:33.070 --> 01:49:33.080 align:start position:0%
one vote just like an article 5
 
01:49:35.189 --> 01:49:35.199 align:start position:0%
convention and then whatever they pass
 
01:49:36.669 --> 01:49:36.679 align:start position:0%
if those Commissioners want to bring it
 
01:49:39.669 --> 01:49:39.679 align:start position:0%
back to the state to adopt a state law
 
01:49:42.629 --> 01:49:42.639 align:start position:0%
they find a sponsor like you did here in
 
01:49:45.870 --> 01:49:45.880 align:start position:0%
the Senate so with that I am going to
 
01:49:49.149 --> 01:49:49.159 align:start position:0%
leave all of the factual information
 
01:49:51.350 --> 01:49:51.360 align:start position:0%
behind so you can read for yourself from
 
01:49:54.390 --> 01:49:54.400 align:start position:0%
the framers about this process refuting
 
01:49:57.109 --> 01:49:57.119 align:start position:0%
that the 1787 Convention was a runaway
 
01:49:58.669 --> 01:49:58.679 align:start position:0%
that's complete nonsense let's not
 
01:50:00.830 --> 01:50:00.840 align:start position:0%
dishonor our framers and let's not
 
01:50:04.350 --> 01:50:04.360 align:start position:0%
listen to The Fear let's have faith and
 
01:50:08.070 --> 01:50:08.080 align:start position:0%
not fear and I want to uh appreciate
 
01:50:09.430 --> 01:50:09.440 align:start position:0%
your time and I'll take any questions
 
01:50:12.629 --> 01:50:12.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:17.149 --> 01:50:17.159 align:start position:0%
you thanks so much Mr
 
01:50:20.750 --> 01:50:20.760 align:start position:0%
questions represent cber yeah um um so
 
01:50:23.350 --> 01:50:23.360 align:start position:0%
it seems like I I guess my question is
 
01:50:23.360 --> 01:50:24.270 align:start position:0%
it seems like I I guess my question is
why

01:50:24.270 --> 01:50:24.280 align:start position:0%
why
 
01:50:27.149 --> 01:50:27.159 align:start position:0%
not you know be more straightforward
 
01:50:29.109 --> 01:50:29.119 align:start position:0%
instead of being kind of broad about
 
01:50:31.550 --> 01:50:31.560 align:start position:0%
election processes why don't why
 
01:50:34.109 --> 01:50:34.119 align:start position:0%
wouldn't we just you know ask for an
 
01:50:37.709 --> 01:50:37.719 align:start position:0%
article 5 convention regarding ending
 
01:50:40.310 --> 01:50:40.320 align:start position:0%
jury mandering or or to end jury
 
01:50:41.990 --> 01:50:42.000 align:start position:0%
mandering and be like direct and
 
01:50:43.830 --> 01:50:43.840 align:start position:0%
straightforward and P that and the
 
01:50:45.709 --> 01:50:45.719 align:start position:0%
number of states that needs to be passed
 
01:50:47.870 --> 01:50:47.880 align:start position:0%
and then you already have like that
 
01:50:50.589 --> 01:50:50.599 align:start position:0%
closed subject matter that would be you
 
01:50:52.910 --> 01:50:52.920 align:start position:0%
know that people would really stand
 
01:50:55.629 --> 01:50:55.639 align:start position:0%
behind uh yes well I I believe that was
 
01:51:01.790 --> 01:51:01.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:04.149 --> 01:51:04.159 align:start position:0%
point state did include Jerry anding as
 
01:51:06.350 --> 01:51:06.360 align:start position:0%
well as
 
01:51:09.229 --> 01:51:09.239 align:start position:0%
money um as you know this process and I
 
01:51:12.149 --> 01:51:12.159 align:start position:0%
can't see you um it's hard enough to get
 
01:51:13.990 --> 01:51:14.000 align:start position:0%
states to agree on one subject let alone
 
01:51:15.470 --> 01:51:15.480 align:start position:0%
more than one and so that's why this is
 
01:51:17.350 --> 01:51:17.360 align:start position:0%
a this process is limited the framer's
 
01:51:19.430 --> 01:51:19.440 align:start position:0%
intent was an article 5 convention was
 
01:51:21.750 --> 01:51:21.760 align:start position:0%
for a single Amendment if you read
 
01:51:24.510 --> 01:51:24.520 align:start position:0%
federals 85 uh Alexander Hamilton
 
01:51:27.350 --> 01:51:27.360 align:start position:0%
specifically says that that it's if
 
01:51:30.270 --> 01:51:30.280 align:start position:0%
2third of the states are united in a
 
01:51:33.629 --> 01:51:33.639 align:start position:0%
particular Amendment that's the then
 
01:51:35.470 --> 01:51:35.480 align:start position:0%
they need to apply for it and then three
 
01:51:37.510 --> 01:51:37.520 align:start position:0%
quarters could ratify that particular
 
01:51:40.229 --> 01:51:40.239 align:start position:0%
Amendment so that's why these
 
01:51:43.109 --> 01:51:43.119 align:start position:0%
applications are limited and that's why
 
01:51:44.870 --> 01:51:44.880 align:start position:0%
you introduce too many subject matter it
 
01:51:46.790 --> 01:51:46.800 align:start position:0%
becomes very difficult for a legislature
 
01:51:51.750 --> 01:51:51.760 align:start position:0%
to agree upon that thanks
 
01:51:54.270 --> 01:51:54.280 align:start position:0%
other questions representative finny
 
01:51:56.030 --> 01:51:56.040 align:start position:0%
repes representative finny you're a
 
01:51:56.040 --> 01:51:58.750 align:start position:0%
repes representative finny you're a
co-sponsor

01:51:58.750 --> 01:51:58.760 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor
 
01:52:03.030 --> 01:52:03.040 align:start position:0%
correct uh our tradition is to uh have
 
01:52:04.910 --> 01:52:04.920 align:start position:0%
co-sponsors refrain from
 
01:52:07.149 --> 01:52:07.159 align:start position:0%
engaging especially after having already
 
01:52:11.109 --> 01:52:11.119 align:start position:0%
testified uh other
 
01:52:14.430 --> 01:52:14.440 align:start position:0%
questions thank you Mr quinnn okay next
 
01:52:16.189 --> 01:52:16.199 align:start position:0%
year uh we still have quite a few cards
 
01:52:18.229 --> 01:52:18.239 align:start position:0%
to go through here so we'll uh ask folks
 
01:52:21.669 --> 01:52:21.679 align:start position:0%
to be uh efficient and expeditious as we
 
01:52:23.350 --> 01:52:23.360 align:start position:0%
move forward uh Al
 
01:52:25.669 --> 01:52:25.679 align:start position:0%
brandano has been here before welcome
 
01:52:33.430 --> 01:52:33.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:35.270 --> 01:52:35.280 align:start position:0%
brandano may
 
01:52:39.629 --> 01:52:39.639 align:start position:0%
I proceed yeah yes pass those uh right
 
01:52:46.310 --> 01:52:46.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:00.750 --> 01:53:00.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:02.669 --> 01:53:02.679 align:start position:0%
my name is uh Al brandano I'm from
 
01:53:04.030 --> 01:53:04.040 align:start position:0%
Kensington New Hampshire and I'm
 
01:53:06.830 --> 01:53:06.840 align:start position:0%
representing myself today uh we heard
 
01:53:08.669 --> 01:53:08.679 align:start position:0%
something earlier that there are no
 
01:53:12.149 --> 01:53:12.159 align:start position:0%
experts in the room and I agree with
 
01:53:15.589 --> 01:53:15.599 align:start position:0%
that so let me read from an expert this
 
01:53:18.030 --> 01:53:18.040 align:start position:0%
is George Washington's Farewell Address
 
01:53:20.629 --> 01:53:20.639 align:start position:0%
the bottom part
 
01:53:22.709 --> 01:53:22.719 align:start position:0%
the basis of political systems is the
 
01:53:25.790 --> 01:53:25.800 align:start position:0%
right of people to make and to alter
 
01:53:28.430 --> 01:53:28.440 align:start position:0%
their constitutions their constitutions
 
01:53:31.310 --> 01:53:31.320 align:start position:0%
of government but that the Constitution
 
01:53:34.950 --> 01:53:34.960 align:start position:0%
which at at any any time exists till
 
01:53:38.310 --> 01:53:38.320 align:start position:0%
Changed by an explicit and authentic Act
 
01:53:39.669 --> 01:53:39.679 align:start position:0%
of the whole
 
01:53:43.910 --> 01:53:43.920 align:start position:0%
people is sacredly obligatory upon all
 
01:53:46.990 --> 01:53:47.000 align:start position:0%
the very idea of the power and the right
 
01:53:49.430 --> 01:53:49.440 align:start position:0%
of the people to establish government
 
01:53:52.310 --> 01:53:52.320 align:start position:0%
pre supposes the duty of every
 
01:53:55.750 --> 01:53:55.760 align:start position:0%
individual to obey the established
 
01:53:58.629 --> 01:53:58.639 align:start position:0%
government I think it's safe to say that
 
01:54:01.229 --> 01:54:01.239 align:start position:0%
what we've learned about Article 5 uh
 
01:54:04.990 --> 01:54:05.000 align:start position:0%
Colonel Mason before they signed the
 
01:54:07.510 --> 01:54:07.520 align:start position:0%
Constitution 10 years after the
 
01:54:08.790 --> 01:54:08.800 align:start position:0%
Declaration of
 
01:54:11.830 --> 01:54:11.840 align:start position:0%
Independence they basically said they
 
01:54:13.189 --> 01:54:13.199 align:start position:0%
knew that the federal government would
 
01:54:15.350 --> 01:54:15.360 align:start position:0%
run away and they needed to put some God
 
01:54:17.790 --> 01:54:17.800 align:start position:0%
reils up and what were those God reils
 
01:54:20.189 --> 01:54:20.199 align:start position:0%
it's the only amendment
 
01:54:22.910 --> 01:54:22.920 align:start position:0%
uh to the that they had brought forth
 
01:54:27.470 --> 01:54:27.480 align:start position:0%
that they voted unanimously on Article 5
 
01:54:31.109 --> 01:54:31.119 align:start position:0%
uh what I what I gave to you is an an
 
01:54:34.030 --> 01:54:34.040 align:start position:0%
example of how hard the process is the
 
01:54:36.470 --> 01:54:36.480 align:start position:0%
founding fathers did this for reason
 
01:54:38.189 --> 01:54:38.199 align:start position:0%
they didn't want people amending the
 
01:54:41.149 --> 01:54:41.159 align:start position:0%
Constitution without a very difficult
 
01:54:43.709 --> 01:54:43.719 align:start position:0%
and very high bar the document in front
 
01:54:46.109 --> 01:54:46.119 align:start position:0%
of you shows and outlines what the
 
01:54:48.510 --> 01:54:48.520 align:start position:0%
Congress has to do compared to what the
 
01:54:50.830 --> 01:54:50.840 align:start position:0%
people have to do and if you look at it
 
01:54:54.030 --> 01:54:54.040 align:start position:0%
it's twice as hard right more difficult
 
01:54:56.430 --> 01:54:56.440 align:start position:0%
um so with that I'm not going to go into
 
01:54:59.229 --> 01:54:59.239 align:start position:0%
how many states as you well know the key
 
01:55:02.390 --> 01:55:02.400 align:start position:0%
part of the this this uh Amendment uh
 
01:55:05.189 --> 01:55:05.199 align:start position:0%
the Article 5 movement is the Congress
 
01:55:08.109 --> 01:55:08.119 align:start position:0%
when 23ds of both houses shall deem it
 
01:55:11.910 --> 01:55:11.920 align:start position:0%
necessary necessary shall propose
 
01:55:14.030 --> 01:55:14.040 align:start position:0%
amendments and this is the key word to
 
01:55:17.550 --> 01:55:17.560 align:start position:0%
this constitution it doesn't talk about
 
01:55:19.870 --> 01:55:19.880 align:start position:0%
throwing the Constitution away or adding
 
01:55:22.189 --> 01:55:22.199 align:start position:0%
a new constitution it's very specific if
 
01:55:24.510 --> 01:55:24.520 align:start position:0%
we just read the words and I'm not going
 
01:55:26.629 --> 01:55:26.639 align:start position:0%
to read the entire thing to you but one
 
01:55:28.470 --> 01:55:28.480 align:start position:0%
of the most amazing parts for me in
 
01:55:30.550 --> 01:55:30.560 align:start position:0%
studying this at length is you know you
 
01:55:33.910 --> 01:55:33.920 align:start position:0%
need in this case 34 states 34s to start
 
01:55:37.790 --> 01:55:37.800 align:start position:0%
2/3 rather 34 states 34 states call for
 
01:55:41.430 --> 01:55:41.440 align:start position:0%
a a Convention of an article five they
 
01:55:44.550 --> 01:55:44.560 align:start position:0%
meet they come together they propose
 
01:55:46.669 --> 01:55:46.679 align:start position:0%
amendments that's it it's they don't
 
01:55:49.430 --> 01:55:49.440 align:start position:0%
change the Constitution just propose it
 
01:55:51.310 --> 01:55:51.320 align:start position:0%
then then they send it out to the state
 
01:55:53.830 --> 01:55:53.840 align:start position:0%
legislator houses and senates so think
 
01:55:56.709 --> 01:55:56.719 align:start position:0%
about it every there's about uh there's
 
01:55:58.990 --> 01:55:59.000 align:start position:0%
one house I think Nebraska only has one
 
01:56:02.870 --> 01:56:02.880 align:start position:0%
chamber so 99 state legislators have a
 
01:56:05.430 --> 01:56:05.440 align:start position:0%
chance to take a look at this evaluate
 
01:56:08.910 --> 01:56:08.920 align:start position:0%
it and then at the very end 38 states
 
01:56:12.910 --> 01:56:12.920 align:start position:0%
have to vote to adopt it's pretty
 
01:56:15.109 --> 01:56:15.119 align:start position:0%
amazing bar this fear that we're all
 
01:56:18.030 --> 01:56:18.040 align:start position:0%
talking about my God if we believe that
 
01:56:20.790 --> 01:56:20.800 align:start position:0%
38 States want to do something then by
 
01:56:22.990 --> 01:56:23.000 align:start position:0%
God we should do it because we're not
 
01:56:24.310 --> 01:56:24.320 align:start position:0%
doing it
 
01:56:26.629 --> 01:56:26.639 align:start position:0%
now and let's be honest the federal
 
01:56:28.589 --> 01:56:28.599 align:start position:0%
government is really run away right it's
 
01:56:31.750 --> 01:56:31.760 align:start position:0%
run away from the people um I think
 
01:56:34.069 --> 01:56:34.079 align:start position:0%
Article Five is to break the glass in
 
01:56:35.990 --> 01:56:36.000 align:start position:0%
case of emergency that's where we're at
 
01:56:39.589 --> 01:56:39.599 align:start position:0%
right now 34 trillion in debt that's 332
 
01:56:41.069 --> 01:56:41.079 align:start position:0%
million is
 
01:56:44.310 --> 01:56:44.320 align:start position:0%
$102,000 per person we are in debt uh if
 
01:56:46.310 --> 01:56:46.320 align:start position:0%
you laid dollar bills from end to end it
 
01:56:49.629 --> 01:56:49.639 align:start position:0%
would go around the earth 118,000 times
 
01:56:52.510 --> 01:56:52.520 align:start position:0%
we're in trouble uh additionally
 
01:56:54.990 --> 01:56:55.000 align:start position:0%
specifically related to this bill over
 
01:56:58.669 --> 01:56:58.679 align:start position:0%
80% of the incumbents are reelected and
 
01:57:02.229 --> 01:57:02.239 align:start position:0%
that data is from 1964 to 2020 and the
 
01:57:05.229 --> 01:57:05.239 align:start position:0%
source of that is open Secrets in
 
01:57:09.109 --> 01:57:09.119 align:start position:0%
closing from 1789 to 2019 the house and
 
01:57:12.510 --> 01:57:12.520 align:start position:0%
the Senate have proposed
 
01:57:15.750 --> 01:57:15.760 align:start position:0%
11,484 amendments to the Constitution
 
01:57:19.149 --> 01:57:19.159 align:start position:0%
only 27 have passed so why fear the
 
01:57:19.159 --> 01:57:20.470 align:start position:0%
only 27 have passed so why fear the
state

01:57:20.470 --> 01:57:20.480 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:57:23.310 --> 01:57:23.320 align:start position:0%
if 38 States and 76 state legislatures
 
01:57:25.830 --> 01:57:25.840 align:start position:0%
that are the closest to the people see
 
01:57:28.069 --> 01:57:28.079 align:start position:0%
that the country is in trouble and want
 
01:57:31.470 --> 01:57:31.480 align:start position:0%
to amend and we the people do not use
 
01:57:34.310 --> 01:57:34.320 align:start position:0%
the peaceful enumerated powers these are
 
01:57:35.870 --> 01:57:35.880 align:start position:0%
enumerated powers that we're talking
 
01:57:37.830 --> 01:57:37.840 align:start position:0%
about that were given to us that are
 
01:57:41.189 --> 01:57:41.199 align:start position:0%
ours under Article 5 Powers as a way to
 
01:57:43.830 --> 01:57:43.840 align:start position:0%
address this then we'll simply just lose
 
01:57:43.840 --> 01:57:44.870 align:start position:0%
address this then we'll simply just lose
the

01:57:44.870 --> 01:57:44.880 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:57:47.750 --> 01:57:47.760 align:start position:0%
Republic any
 
01:57:50.350 --> 01:57:50.360 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr br
 
01:57:54.030 --> 01:57:54.040 align:start position:0%
questions uh yes I was to fill you up
 
01:57:55.830 --> 01:57:55.840 align:start position:0%
thank you for your thoughtful testimony
 
01:57:57.709 --> 01:57:57.719 align:start position:0%
we've heard a lot today about what an
 
01:57:59.709 --> 01:57:59.719 align:start position:0%
article 5 convention could or could not
 
01:58:01.990 --> 01:58:02.000 align:start position:0%
do or what various experts have said on
 
01:58:05.149 --> 01:58:05.159 align:start position:0%
it what has the Supreme Court alined on
 
01:58:07.189 --> 01:58:07.199 align:start position:0%
an article 5 convention what a
 
01:58:10.629 --> 01:58:10.639 align:start position:0%
convention could or could not do um
 
01:58:13.189 --> 01:58:13.199 align:start position:0%
there is no the Supreme Court I I'm not
 
01:58:15.030 --> 01:58:15.040 align:start position:0%
an expert on the Supreme Court but I can
 
01:58:17.069 --> 01:58:17.079 align:start position:0%
tell you about New Hampshire I can tell
 
01:58:18.310 --> 01:58:18.320 align:start position:0%
you about New
 
01:58:22.629 --> 01:58:22.639 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um in 2015 the house and the
 
01:58:24.629 --> 01:58:24.639 align:start position:0%
Senate came together and passed a bill I
 
01:58:29.430 --> 01:58:29.440 align:start position:0%
think it HP 146 which identified the
 
01:58:31.550 --> 01:58:31.560 align:start position:0%
responsibilities of faithful delegates
 
01:58:33.870 --> 01:58:33.880 align:start position:0%
or Commissioners we did that we passed
 
01:58:35.950 --> 01:58:35.960 align:start position:0%
it and it ended up going to Maggie
 
01:58:37.790 --> 01:58:37.800 align:start position:0%
hasson's desk and it wasn't signed and
 
01:58:39.510 --> 01:58:39.520 align:start position:0%
it couldn't be overridden because it
 
01:58:42.189 --> 01:58:42.199 align:start position:0%
didn't have enough votes since then we
 
01:58:45.990 --> 01:58:46.000 align:start position:0%
have had five attempts uh and last last
 
01:58:46.000 --> 01:58:47.030 align:start position:0%
have had five attempts uh and last last
year

01:58:47.030 --> 01:58:47.040 align:start position:0%
year
 
01:58:50.990 --> 01:58:51.000 align:start position:0%
hc4 was fateful delegate so for for you
 
01:58:54.189 --> 01:58:54.199 align:start position:0%
your legislators to be able to put uh
 
01:58:57.310 --> 01:58:57.320 align:start position:0%
guide rails or or direction to our
 
01:58:59.750 --> 01:58:59.760 align:start position:0%
commissioners are faithful delegates but
 
01:59:02.470 --> 01:59:02.480 align:start position:0%
unfortunately it hasn't passed here so I
 
01:59:04.229 --> 01:59:04.239 align:start position:0%
think the strongest thing you could do
 
01:59:08.629 --> 01:59:08.639 align:start position:0%
is uh I support this uh this bill and if
 
01:59:11.390 --> 01:59:11.400 align:start position:0%
you believe like I do that if you need
 
01:59:13.589 --> 01:59:13.599 align:start position:0%
to give people more Direction then do it
 
01:59:16.629 --> 01:59:16.639 align:start position:0%
by legislation through through the um
 
01:59:19.709 --> 01:59:19.719 align:start position:0%
Commissioners or fateful delegate and
 
01:59:21.790 --> 01:59:21.800 align:start position:0%
allow this to to move forward because it
 
01:59:24.830 --> 01:59:24.840 align:start position:0%
really does need we're in trouble I mean
 
01:59:27.350 --> 01:59:27.360 align:start position:0%
every day you turn on the news it you
 
01:59:29.830 --> 01:59:29.840 align:start position:0%
don't have to go very far I and I hope I
 
01:59:32.470 --> 01:59:32.480 align:start position:0%

of an Amendment to the US Constitution
 
02:00:29.830 --> 02:00:29.840 align:start position:0%

02:00:38.270 --> 02:00:38.280 align:start position:0%
guaranteed work that funds my retirement

I might be homeless or dead I'm neurod

02:00:54.430 --> 02:00:54.440 align:start position:0%
support that I
 
02:00:57.390 --> 02:00:57.400 align:start position:0%
had when I struggled in school my mother
 
02:00:59.430 --> 02:00:59.440 align:start position:0%
was there to help
 
02:01:02.149 --> 02:01:02.159 align:start position:0%
me but there are too many families now
 
02:01:04.030 --> 02:01:04.040 align:start position:0%
that are two income families that have
 
02:01:06.629 --> 02:01:06.639 align:start position:0%
to be two income
 
02:01:09.470 --> 02:01:09.480 align:start position:0%
families they don't have the resources
 
02:01:12.510 --> 02:01:12.520 align:start position:0%
to take the time off from work to spend
 
02:01:14.870 --> 02:01:14.880 align:start position:0%
the time with their children that need
 
02:01:18.030 --> 02:01:18.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:18.040 --> 02:01:20.550 align:start position:0%
 
help

02:01:20.550 --> 02:01:20.560 align:start position:0%
help
 
02:01:22.750 --> 02:01:22.760 align:start position:0%
I am fortunate that my income and
 
02:01:24.910 --> 02:01:24.920 align:start position:0%
medical coverage allows me to access to
 
02:01:27.430 --> 02:01:27.440 align:start position:0%
the mental health care I need but those
 
02:01:29.990 --> 02:01:30.000 align:start position:0%
who do not have the Privileges I enjoyed
 
02:01:32.870 --> 02:01:32.880 align:start position:0%
the support that I received continue to
 
02:01:34.629 --> 02:01:34.639 align:start position:0%
be left in the cold because they cannot
 
02:01:37.109 --> 02:01:37.119 align:start position:0%
afford the cost of mental health care
 
02:01:39.270 --> 02:01:39.280 align:start position:0%
whether due to medication prices or
 
02:01:39.280 --> 02:01:42.189 align:start position:0%
whether due to medication prices or
covered

02:01:42.189 --> 02:01:42.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:44.350 --> 02:01:44.360 align:start position:0%
conditions corporate money going to
 
02:01:46.669 --> 02:01:46.679 align:start position:0%
politicians leads these politicians to
 
02:01:49.069 --> 02:01:49.079 align:start position:0%
voting against letting Medicare and
 
02:01:51.510 --> 02:01:51.520 align:start position:0%
Medicaid negotiate for lower costs
 
02:01:53.669 --> 02:01:53.679 align:start position:0%
voting against increasing the minimum
 
02:01:56.229 --> 02:01:56.239 align:start position:0%
wage and Paid Family Leave against
 
02:01:58.950 --> 02:01:58.960 align:start position:0%
single-payer Health Care all these
 
02:02:00.950 --> 02:02:00.960 align:start position:0%
things that make make it difficult for
 
02:02:03.109 --> 02:02:03.119 align:start position:0%
lower income families to afford the
 
02:02:05.189 --> 02:02:05.199 align:start position:0%
medical services they
 
02:02:07.750 --> 02:02:07.760 align:start position:0%
need in holding a constitutional
 
02:02:10.550 --> 02:02:10.560 align:start position:0%
convention with a specific goal and
 
02:02:13.470 --> 02:02:13.480 align:start position:0%
guidelines to limit the topics addressed
 
02:02:15.950 --> 02:02:15.960 align:start position:0%
we can define a change that ensures our
 
02:02:18.390 --> 02:02:18.400 align:start position:0%
Senators and representatives are working
 
02:02:22.669 --> 02:02:22.679 align:start position:0%
for the people instead of for
 
02:02:24.830 --> 02:02:24.840 align:start position:0%
corporations again I thank you for your
 
02:02:28.189 --> 02:02:28.199 align:start position:0%

sherff here and we um yes so I'm a uh uh
 
02:03:10.629 --> 02:03:10.639 align:start position:0%
US Army veteran uh member of the S
 
02:03:13.270 --> 02:03:13.280 align:start position:0%
sunsay American Revolution like my uh my
 
02:03:16.270 --> 02:03:16.280 align:start position:0%
cousin here and uh lived up here since
 
02:03:16.280 --> 02:03:17.229 align:start position:0%

02:03:17.229 --> 02:03:17.239 align:start position:0%

02:03:20.589 --> 02:03:20.599 align:start position:0%
2020 and I come before you of course to
 
02:03:24.990 --> 02:03:25.000 align:start position:0%
oppose um or itl HCR um
 
02:03:28.149 --> 02:03:28.159 align:start position:0%
hcr8 um it sounds very lofty free and
 
02:03:30.390 --> 02:03:30.400 align:start position:0%
fair elections I think anybody any
 
02:03:32.109 --> 02:03:32.119 align:start position:0%
reasonable person wants such free and
 
02:03:34.750 --> 02:03:34.760 align:start position:0%
fair elections but generally I believe
 
02:03:37.830 --> 02:03:37.840 align:start position:0%
this amendment may give more power to
 
02:03:38.910 --> 02:03:38.920 align:start position:0%
the federal
 
02:03:40.830 --> 02:03:40.840 align:start position:0%
government over
 
02:03:43.189 --> 02:03:43.199 align:start position:0%
elections I am in sympathy with many
 
02:03:45.669 --> 02:03:45.679 align:start position:0%
people Advocate an arle convention I
 
02:03:47.430 --> 02:03:47.440 align:start position:0%
have a number of friends who are support
 
02:03:49.549 --> 02:03:49.559 align:start position:0%
one I've have conven some of them to
 
02:03:52.189 --> 02:03:52.199 align:start position:0%
change the position and some I have not
 
02:03:53.589 --> 02:03:53.599 align:start position:0%
uh but I don't think adding amendments
 
02:03:55.549 --> 02:03:55.559 align:start position:0%
to the Constitution will solve our
 
02:03:58.109 --> 02:03:58.119 align:start position:0%
nation's problems I think we have a
 
02:04:00.510 --> 02:04:00.520 align:start position:0%
pretty good Constitution as it is and
 
02:04:03.189 --> 02:04:03.199 align:start position:0%
the problem is that it's largely ignored
 
02:04:06.350 --> 02:04:06.360 align:start position:0%
at the federal level um and by by the
 
02:04:08.430 --> 02:04:08.440 align:start position:0%
way both parties are involved not just
 
02:04:10.790 --> 02:04:10.800 align:start position:0%
both major parties uh these are some of
 
02:04:13.470 --> 02:04:13.480 align:start position:0%
the reasons why I oppose an article 5
 
02:04:15.750 --> 02:04:15.760 align:start position:0%
convention it cannot be limited to one
 
02:04:18.510 --> 02:04:18.520 align:start position:0%
Amendment or topic regardless of what
 
02:04:21.270 --> 02:04:21.280 align:start position:0%
people may say because Article 5 doesn't
 
02:04:24.149 --> 02:04:24.159 align:start position:0%
specify that you get you go to you go to
 
02:04:26.510 --> 02:04:26.520 align:start position:0%
the Constitution and this is the powers
 
02:04:28.870 --> 02:04:28.880 align:start position:0%
and the duties and it doesn't say one
 
02:04:32.350 --> 02:04:32.360 align:start position:0%
Amendment or a topic it says
 
02:04:36.069 --> 02:04:36.079 align:start position:0%
amendments um there are no laws or rules
 
02:04:38.790 --> 02:04:38.800 align:start position:0%
concerning an article 5 convention a few
 
02:04:40.750 --> 02:04:40.760 align:start position:0%
states have passed waywood delegate or
 
02:04:43.229 --> 02:04:43.239 align:start position:0%
faithful delegate laws which actually
 
02:04:45.069 --> 02:04:45.079 align:start position:0%
indicates that maybe some of them will
 
02:04:47.990 --> 02:04:48.000 align:start position:0%
not be faithful to the instructions that
 
02:04:49.549 --> 02:04:49.559 align:start position:0%
they might be given given at by the
 
02:04:49.559 --> 02:04:51.390 align:start position:0%
they might be given given at by the
state

02:04:51.390 --> 02:04:51.400 align:start position:0%
state
 
02:04:53.870 --> 02:04:53.880 align:start position:0%
legislatures um I think New Hampshire
 
02:04:55.950 --> 02:04:55.960 align:start position:0%
has a bill that seeks to do the same it
 
02:04:58.709 --> 02:04:58.719 align:start position:0%
is the job of Congress to make the rules
 
02:05:00.870 --> 02:05:00.880 align:start position:0%
under Article 1 Section 8 the last
 
02:05:03.390 --> 02:05:03.400 align:start position:0%
Clause is necessary and proper clause
 
02:05:06.069 --> 02:05:06.079 align:start position:0%
and for proof of that I'm not going to
 
02:05:10.189 --> 02:05:10.199 align:start position:0%
read this but this was uh 1979 there was
 
02:05:11.790 --> 02:05:11.800 align:start position:0%
several bills that went to the Senate
 
02:05:15.109 --> 02:05:15.119 align:start position:0%
Judiciary Committee uh concerning the
 
02:05:17.950 --> 02:05:17.960 align:start position:0%
rules of laws of an article 5 nothing
 
02:05:20.790 --> 02:05:20.800 align:start position:0%
was passed I have this in a PDF version
 
02:05:22.470 --> 02:05:22.480 align:start position:0%
if you like I can send it to you just
 
02:05:25.430 --> 02:05:25.440 align:start position:0%
just to say yes Congress does believe
 
02:05:27.350 --> 02:05:27.360 align:start position:0%
although it hasn't passed any that it
 
02:05:30.189 --> 02:05:30.199 align:start position:0%
does control an article 5
 
02:05:33.030 --> 02:05:33.040 align:start position:0%
convention um we have no idea who the
 
02:05:36.430 --> 02:05:36.440 align:start position:0%
delegates will be this resolution by the
 
02:05:38.589 --> 02:05:38.599 align:start position:0%
way actually lists several ways that the
 
02:05:41.189 --> 02:05:41.199 align:start position:0%
delegates will be chosen and then also
 
02:05:43.229 --> 02:05:43.239 align:start position:0%
those that will be restricted but that
 
02:05:44.910 --> 02:05:44.920 align:start position:0%
to me is null and void because it does
 
02:05:46.910 --> 02:05:46.920 align:start position:0%
not have the power the states do not
 
02:05:50.109 --> 02:05:50.119 align:start position:0%
have that power it's not in article
 
02:05:53.709 --> 02:05:53.719 align:start position:0%
5 um state legislators may not have an
 
02:05:55.589 --> 02:05:55.599 align:start position:0%
opportunity to vote on any proposed
 
02:05:57.310 --> 02:05:57.320 align:start position:0%
amendments now we just heard one of the
 
02:06:00.149 --> 02:06:00.159 align:start position:0%
gentlemen well-intentioned he said that
 
02:06:02.669 --> 02:06:02.679 align:start position:0%
uh it has to go to the three four three4
 
02:06:05.470 --> 02:06:05.480 align:start position:0%
of the state legislator but Congress has
 
02:06:08.069 --> 02:06:08.079 align:start position:0%
another mode which is in Article 5 they
 
02:06:09.709 --> 02:06:09.719 align:start position:0%
seem to fail to mention it's called
 
02:06:11.750 --> 02:06:11.760 align:start position:0%
ratifying conventions so Congress can
 
02:06:13.669 --> 02:06:13.679 align:start position:0%
say here are the amendments who are
 
02:06:16.189 --> 02:06:16.199 align:start position:0%
going to choose a ratifying convention
 
02:06:18.229 --> 02:06:18.239 align:start position:0%
so you won't have you may never get a
 
02:06:19.990 --> 02:06:20.000 align:start position:0%
chance to to vote on any amendments
 
02:06:22.549 --> 02:06:22.559 align:start position:0%
proposed at a convention and the
 
02:06:25.310 --> 02:06:25.320 align:start position:0%
precedent is um the 18th amendment that
 
02:06:27.870 --> 02:06:27.880 align:start position:0%
was concerning the prohibition that was
 
02:06:30.510 --> 02:06:30.520 align:start position:0%
a ratifying convention it didn't go to
 
02:06:31.750 --> 02:06:31.760 align:start position:0%
the legis
 
02:06:31.760 --> 02:06:33.510 align:start position:0%
the legis
legislates

02:06:33.510 --> 02:06:33.520 align:start position:0%
legislates
 
02:06:36.310 --> 02:06:36.320 align:start position:0%
um uh will the vote at a convention be
 
02:06:39.069 --> 02:06:39.079 align:start position:0%
one state or one state one vote or
 
02:06:41.030 --> 02:06:41.040 align:start position:0%
baseed on electoral representation we
 
02:06:43.549 --> 02:06:43.559 align:start position:0%
don't know that and nobody can say that
 
02:06:46.390 --> 02:06:46.400 align:start position:0%
they that will be one state one vote so
 
02:06:48.950 --> 02:06:48.960 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire will have four votes Cali
 
02:06:50.430 --> 02:06:50.440 align:start position:0%
has something like 50
 
02:06:54.430 --> 02:06:54.440 align:start position:0%
votes um New Hampshire voters rejected a
 
02:06:57.350 --> 02:06:57.360 align:start position:0%
State Convention by a wide margin 66% in
 
02:06:59.589 --> 02:06:59.599 align:start position:0%
the last election while State
 
02:07:01.270 --> 02:07:01.280 align:start position:0%
constitutional conventions are different
 
02:07:03.350 --> 02:07:03.360 align:start position:0%
from an article 5 convention it does
 
02:07:05.470 --> 02:07:05.480 align:start position:0%
indicate a basic distrust of conventions
 
02:07:09.470 --> 02:07:09.480 align:start position:0%
that concern a constitution since 2016
 
02:07:11.750 --> 02:07:11.760 align:start position:0%
eight states have rescinded all of their
 
02:07:13.669 --> 02:07:13.679 align:start position:0%
applications and I have I won't go I
 
02:07:16.030 --> 02:07:16.040 align:start position:0%
just save the time I won't mention it
 
02:07:19.910 --> 02:07:19.920 align:start position:0%
interesting in the resolution HCR um
 
02:07:22.310 --> 02:07:22.320 align:start position:0%
hcr8 it says that New Jersey and
 
02:07:24.790 --> 02:07:24.800 align:start position:0%
Illinois passed this resolution but it
 
02:07:27.310 --> 02:07:27.320 align:start position:0%
also has since resend rescinded that
 
02:07:30.629 --> 02:07:30.639 align:start position:0%
resolution now um I don't accept the
 
02:07:32.830 --> 02:07:32.840 align:start position:0%
concept of a runaway convention because
 
02:07:35.189 --> 02:07:35.199 align:start position:0%
that presupposes one can be limited to a
 
02:07:35.199 --> 02:07:36.270 align:start position:0%
that presupposes one can be limited to a
certain

02:07:36.270 --> 02:07:36.280 align:start position:0%
certain
 
02:07:39.109 --> 02:07:39.119 align:start position:0%
topic but I was at an event at Harvey
 
02:07:43.629 --> 02:07:43.639 align:start position:0%
University in 2011 it was called um the
 
02:07:45.709 --> 02:07:45.719 align:start position:0%
uh uh conference on the Constitutional
 
02:07:47.629 --> 02:07:47.639 align:start position:0%
Convention it was co-chaired by Mark
 
02:07:49.990 --> 02:07:50.000 align:start position:0%
mecka who ended ended up co-founding
 
02:07:53.470 --> 02:07:53.480 align:start position:0%
Convention of states and Larry leik a
 
02:07:55.950 --> 02:07:55.960 align:start position:0%
Harvard law professor a gentleman by the
 
02:07:57.830 --> 02:07:57.840 align:start position:0%
name of Chen yuger at the time I didn't
 
02:08:00.229 --> 02:08:00.239 align:start position:0%
know who he was he was interviewing
 
02:08:03.149 --> 02:08:03.159 align:start position:0%
Larry lesk outside of the uh and I got
 
02:08:04.830 --> 02:08:04.840 align:start position:0%
it on video and I have a link there on
 
02:08:07.830 --> 02:08:07.840 align:start position:0%
my testimony they were hoping for a
 
02:08:10.189 --> 02:08:10.199 align:start position:0%
runaway they were laughing about it
 
02:08:11.750 --> 02:08:11.760 align:start position:0%
hahaa we should have one it would be
 
02:08:15.510 --> 02:08:15.520 align:start position:0%
great so the founder of of Wolfpack who
 
02:08:17.510 --> 02:08:17.520 align:start position:0%
was the me this organization's pushing
 
02:08:19.990 --> 02:08:20.000 align:start position:0%
this notes that there can be a runaway
 
02:08:21.510 --> 02:08:21.520 align:start position:0%
there maybe there can be but again I
 
02:08:23.430 --> 02:08:23.440 align:start position:0%
don't accept the concept of runaway
 
02:08:25.709 --> 02:08:25.719 align:start position:0%
because that presupposes that one can be
 
02:08:28.229 --> 02:08:28.239 align:start position:0%
limited so uh I want again thank you
 
02:08:29.709 --> 02:08:29.719 align:start position:0%
that's all that's all I have I thank you
 
02:08:31.870 --> 02:08:31.880 align:start position:0%
for your uh listening any questions I
 
02:08:34.390 --> 02:08:34.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:38.149 --> 02:08:38.159 align:start position:0%
answer thank thank you so much
 
02:08:41.350 --> 02:08:41.360 align:start position:0%
questions thank you see uh before I go
 
02:08:44.109 --> 02:08:44.119 align:start position:0%
to the next speaker um the the I made a
 
02:08:45.510 --> 02:08:45.520 align:start position:0%
note to myself when you mentioned
 
02:08:47.350 --> 02:08:47.360 align:start position:0%
ratifying convention I want to get a
 
02:08:49.350 --> 02:08:49.360 align:start position:0%
little bit more informed on that so
 
02:08:52.350 --> 02:08:52.360 align:start position:0%
before we exec this in a week or two um
 
02:08:53.910 --> 02:08:53.920 align:start position:0%
maybe the
 
02:08:57.549 --> 02:08:57.559 align:start position:0%
the the prime uh we don't have time no
 
02:08:59.430 --> 02:08:59.440 align:start position:0%
you go ahead you can stand down I'm just
 
02:09:01.109 --> 02:09:01.119 align:start position:0%
making I'm picking up on your comment
 
02:09:04.069 --> 02:09:04.079 align:start position:0%
about a ratifying convention which um I
 
02:09:05.870 --> 02:09:05.880 align:start position:0%
know I perhaps some of the other members
 
02:09:09.510 --> 02:09:09.520 align:start position:0%
w't understand better by the time we EXA
 
02:09:14.549 --> 02:09:14.559 align:start position:0%
this um Haley Shaw from Allenstown
 
02:09:17.030 --> 02:09:17.040 align:start position:0%
supports the bill is
 
02:09:20.790 --> 02:09:20.800 align:start position:0%
Haley here looks like that must be Haley
 
02:09:26.430 --> 02:09:26.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:29.510 --> 02:09:29.520 align:start position:0%
minutes hi everyone I'm Haley Shaw from
 
02:09:32.109 --> 02:09:32.119 align:start position:0%
Allenstown New Hampshire uh and I
 
02:09:34.870 --> 02:09:34.880 align:start position:0%
represent Convention of States um I'm
 
02:09:36.510 --> 02:09:36.520 align:start position:0%
going to keep this really brief because
 
02:09:37.990 --> 02:09:38.000 align:start position:0%
everybody has said a lot of the same
 
02:09:41.189 --> 02:09:41.199 align:start position:0%
things that I want to say but um we
 
02:09:42.870 --> 02:09:42.880 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be afraid of having an article
 
02:09:46.350 --> 02:09:46.360 align:start position:0%
5 convention it's simply a conversation
 
02:09:49.470 --> 02:09:49.480 align:start position:0%
amongst states and and to say that
 
02:09:51.629 --> 02:09:51.639 align:start position:0%
states are going to have you know go
 
02:09:54.109 --> 02:09:54.119 align:start position:0%
crazy or go Rogue just simply having a
 
02:09:56.669 --> 02:09:56.679 align:start position:0%
conversation really just says that
 
02:09:58.830 --> 02:09:58.840 align:start position:0%
people like yourselves are going to go
 
02:10:02.310 --> 02:10:02.320 align:start position:0%
to a convention and and bring in chaos
 
02:10:04.189 --> 02:10:04.199 align:start position:0%
which I just simply don't believe that
 
02:10:07.430 --> 02:10:07.440 align:start position:0%
is true and this is the checkin balance
 
02:10:10.069 --> 02:10:10.079 align:start position:0%
for the people through you to have you
 
02:10:11.629 --> 02:10:11.639 align:start position:0%
know on the states to have on the
 
02:10:14.510 --> 02:10:14.520 align:start position:0%
federal government and to simply not use
 
02:10:17.149 --> 02:10:17.159 align:start position:0%
that uh that's not really utilizing the
 
02:10:19.350 --> 02:10:19.360 align:start position:0%
Constitution to the full list so I
 
02:10:21.669 --> 02:10:21.679 align:start position:0%
believe that you should start to see
 
02:10:24.470 --> 02:10:24.480 align:start position:0%
more of these applications because we
 
02:10:27.149 --> 02:10:27.159 align:start position:0%
should have more conventions among
 
02:10:30.270 --> 02:10:30.280 align:start position:0%
states to have conversations for simple
 
02:10:33.030 --> 02:10:33.040 align:start position:0%
subject of you know single subjects
 
02:10:35.350 --> 02:10:35.360 align:start position:0%
conversations simply because the federal
 
02:10:36.990 --> 02:10:37.000 align:start position:0%
government is not listening and not
 
02:10:38.709 --> 02:10:38.719 align:start position:0%
taking into account what the states and
 
02:10:41.109 --> 02:10:41.119 align:start position:0%
the people want so I think everybody
 
02:10:43.229 --> 02:10:43.239 align:start position:0%
should get used to having a convention
 
02:10:45.350 --> 02:10:45.360 align:start position:0%
and we should see more conventions and
 
02:10:48.430 --> 02:10:48.440 align:start position:0%
so I think just simply making it more
 
02:10:51.390 --> 02:10:51.400 align:start position:0%
common uh makes us less afraid and it's
 
02:10:54.109 --> 02:10:54.119 align:start position:0%
going to take one to start this process
 
02:10:56.030 --> 02:10:56.040 align:start position:0%
and let's stop being afraid of what it
 
02:10:58.510 --> 02:10:58.520 align:start position:0%
could be and actually call one and see
 
02:11:00.549 --> 02:11:00.559 align:start position:0%
what it's going to be and I think you
 
02:11:01.790 --> 02:11:01.800 align:start position:0%
should have a lot more faith in
 
02:11:04.350 --> 02:11:04.360 align:start position:0%
yourselves and faith in other members
 
02:11:06.629 --> 02:11:06.639 align:start position:0%
like you in from other states to call
 
02:11:09.030 --> 02:11:09.040 align:start position:0%
these conventions and that's simply just
 
02:11:11.629 --> 02:11:11.639 align:start position:0%
all I'm going to say
 
02:11:14.910 --> 02:11:14.920 align:start position:0%
thanks questions for
 
02:11:18.229 --> 02:11:18.239 align:start position:0%
Haley question for the chair uh yes uh
 
02:11:20.790 --> 02:11:20.800 align:start position:0%
representative uh thank you Mr chairman
 
02:11:22.229 --> 02:11:22.239 align:start position:0%
uh you mentioned about getting more
 
02:11:24.069 --> 02:11:24.079 align:start position:0%
information about what a ratifying
 
02:11:25.390 --> 02:11:25.400 align:start position:0%
convention is I think that's an
 
02:11:27.629 --> 02:11:27.639 align:start position:0%
excellent idea we going to go through
 
02:11:29.830 --> 02:11:29.840 align:start position:0%
our committee researcher or office of
 
02:11:32.790 --> 02:11:32.800 align:start position:0%
legislative services to get that sure
 
02:11:34.549 --> 02:11:34.559 align:start position:0%
the question if you didn't hear was was
 
02:11:36.750 --> 02:11:36.760 align:start position:0%
from representative shlif I raised a
 
02:11:39.149 --> 02:11:39.159 align:start position:0%
point about uh understanding ratifying
 
02:11:41.750 --> 02:11:41.760 align:start position:0%
convention concept better uh yeah I
 
02:11:43.229 --> 02:11:43.239 align:start position:0%
think our researcher certainly could
 
02:11:46.629 --> 02:11:46.639 align:start position:0%
help with that and I was going to invite
 
02:11:49.790 --> 02:11:49.800 align:start position:0%
the prime sponsor as well to respond to
 
02:11:50.830 --> 02:11:50.840 align:start position:0%
uh the
 
02:11:53.430 --> 02:11:53.440 align:start position:0%
ratifying convention issue you decided
 
02:11:55.189 --> 02:11:55.199 align:start position:0%
to mention I the prime earlier that's
 
02:11:57.870 --> 02:11:57.880 align:start position:0%
why I raised this question with all due
 
02:11:59.549 --> 02:11:59.559 align:start position:0%
respect to the prime sponsors and those
 
02:12:03.310 --> 02:12:03.320 align:start position:0%
that have SP spoken support of this uh
 
02:12:05.589 --> 02:12:05.599 align:start position:0%
uh piece of legislation I think it would
 
02:12:08.790 --> 02:12:08.800 align:start position:0%
be better for us to get it from uh House
 
02:12:11.510 --> 02:12:11.520 align:start position:0%
services just so we know that uh it's
 
02:12:15.270 --> 02:12:15.280 align:start position:0%
from a disinterested third party that
 
02:12:18.109 --> 02:12:18.119 align:start position:0%
information e excellent point uh if you
 
02:12:20.510 --> 02:12:20.520 align:start position:0%
didn't hear that uh in getting
 
02:12:24.069 --> 02:12:24.079 align:start position:0%
clarification on anything uh we have yes
 
02:12:27.030 --> 02:12:27.040 align:start position:0%
to to go to neutral sources to to find
 
02:12:28.549 --> 02:12:28.559 align:start position:0%
that information that's not to say
 
02:12:32.310 --> 02:12:32.320 align:start position:0%
anyone certainly can can amplify uh to
 
02:12:35.470 --> 02:12:35.480 align:start position:0%
any of us any anything that came up uh
 
02:12:37.750 --> 02:12:37.760 align:start position:0%
to help us to understand anything better
 
02:12:41.549 --> 02:12:41.559 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for that um Matthew
 
02:12:44.470 --> 02:12:44.480 align:start position:0%
rhods opposes the bill uh Matthew
 
02:12:47.390 --> 02:12:47.400 align:start position:0%
welcome you were here early today asked
 
02:12:49.430 --> 02:12:49.440 align:start position:0%
for 3 minutes Matthew came all the way
 
02:12:54.790 --> 02:12:54.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:58.310 --> 02:12:58.320 align:start position:0%
Maine hi everybody how you doing um can
 
02:13:01.390 --> 02:13:01.400 align:start position:0%
you hear me great okay thank you I just
 
02:13:02.549 --> 02:13:02.559 align:start position:0%
want to warn the committee that I'm a
 
02:13:03.910 --> 02:13:03.920 align:start position:0%
little hard of hearing so if you ask me
 
02:13:06.390 --> 02:13:06.400 align:start position:0%
a question I might not hear you so you
 
02:13:08.510 --> 02:13:08.520 align:start position:0%
just have to shout it out really loud so
 
02:13:11.830 --> 02:13:11.840 align:start position:0%
anyway I'm here to oppose HDR 8 because
 
02:13:14.109 --> 02:13:14.119 align:start position:0%
um I believe that the convention of
 
02:13:16.790 --> 02:13:16.800 align:start position:0%
State Lobby is uh is a very misleading
 
02:13:20.310 --> 02:13:20.320 align:start position:0%
Lobby uh they tend to pre on people's uh
 
02:13:22.390 --> 02:13:22.400 align:start position:0%
heartstrings with things like election
 
02:13:26.030 --> 02:13:26.040 align:start position:0%
Integrity like today or uh balance
 
02:13:28.310 --> 02:13:28.320 align:start position:0%
budget amendments or term limits and and
 
02:13:30.030 --> 02:13:30.040 align:start position:0%
all the while talking to us about how
 
02:13:33.430 --> 02:13:33.440 align:start position:0%
evil Congress is so the one thing that
 
02:13:35.430 --> 02:13:35.440 align:start position:0%
we do know about a Convention of states
 
02:13:38.069 --> 02:13:38.079 align:start position:0%
is that or an article 5 convention is
 
02:13:40.350 --> 02:13:40.360 align:start position:0%
there's no mechanism or blueprint for
 
02:13:42.830 --> 02:13:42.840 align:start position:0%
how that will take place so for me if
 
02:13:44.350 --> 02:13:44.360 align:start position:0%
I'm going to engage in any kind of
 
02:13:46.589 --> 02:13:46.599 align:start position:0%
activity I would imagine that I want
 
02:13:48.830 --> 02:13:48.840 align:start position:0%
would want at least a rule book in place
 
02:13:50.950 --> 02:13:50.960 align:start position:0%
before I get started you know that would
 
02:13:52.549 --> 02:13:52.559 align:start position:0%
be like starting a game of football and
 
02:13:54.750 --> 02:13:54.760 align:start position:0%
saying well you you know you only have
 
02:13:56.549 --> 02:13:56.559 align:start position:0%
to get to the fifth yard line to get a
 
02:13:59.189 --> 02:13:59.199 align:start position:0%
touchdown so I would think that in any
 
02:14:01.510 --> 02:14:01.520 align:start position:0%
honest uh group of people before you
 
02:14:03.589 --> 02:14:03.599 align:start position:0%
engage in any kind of activity at the
 
02:14:05.709 --> 02:14:05.719 align:start position:0%
government level you would say this is
 
02:14:06.950 --> 02:14:06.960 align:start position:0%
what we're going to do this is how the
 
02:14:08.750 --> 02:14:08.760 align:start position:0%
rulebook is going to be played out and
 
02:14:10.669 --> 02:14:10.679 align:start position:0%
so far that rule book really hasn't been
 
02:14:13.069 --> 02:14:13.079 align:start position:0%
established that's a simple fact we can
 
02:14:15.189 --> 02:14:15.199 align:start position:0%
talk about it all we want we could say
 
02:14:17.950 --> 02:14:17.960 align:start position:0%
hey this is these reassurances over here
 
02:14:19.229 --> 02:14:19.239 align:start position:0%
it's going to be limited to this it's
 
02:14:21.270 --> 02:14:21.280 align:start position:0%
going to be limited to that but the
 
02:14:23.390 --> 02:14:23.400 align:start position:0%
Constitution is silent on the mechanisms
 
02:14:25.189 --> 02:14:25.199 align:start position:0%
and blueprints by which an article 5
 
02:14:29.030 --> 02:14:29.040 align:start position:0%
convention will take place so um we know
 
02:14:30.910 --> 02:14:30.920 align:start position:0%
that the uh the Articles of
 
02:14:33.549 --> 02:14:33.559 align:start position:0%
Confederation were thrown out when there
 
02:14:36.109 --> 02:14:36.119 align:start position:0%
was uh rules already attached to how
 
02:14:38.069 --> 02:14:38.079 align:start position:0%
that convention would take place and the
 
02:14:39.709 --> 02:14:39.719 align:start position:0%
delegates came in said nope we're not
 
02:14:43.189 --> 02:14:43.199 align:start position:0%
going to play it that way um we also
 
02:14:45.830 --> 02:14:45.840 align:start position:0%
know you know and we talk about uh
 
02:14:48.310 --> 02:14:48.320 align:start position:0%
Congress all the time you know and it
 
02:14:49.950 --> 02:14:49.960 align:start position:0%
always sounds Noble to people oh
 
02:14:52.109 --> 02:14:52.119 align:start position:0%
congress is evil Congress is bad let's
 
02:14:54.709 --> 02:14:54.719 align:start position:0%
reign in Congress but all the time these
 
02:14:57.470 --> 02:14:57.480 align:start position:0%
state legislators and I I'm not pointing
 
02:14:59.470 --> 02:14:59.480 align:start position:0%
any fingers and I'm not intending to
 
02:15:02.510 --> 02:15:02.520 align:start position:0%
insult people but they're taking the
 
02:15:04.510 --> 02:15:04.520 align:start position:0%
Congressional funds I mean look at the
 
02:15:06.149 --> 02:15:06.159 align:start position:0%
dependency that the states have on
 
02:15:08.750 --> 02:15:08.760 align:start position:0%
federal money I can't I can promise you
 
02:15:10.470 --> 02:15:10.480 align:start position:0%
that most of it's probably not
 
02:15:12.709 --> 02:15:12.719 align:start position:0%
constitutional however the state
 
02:15:15.270 --> 02:15:15.280 align:start position:0%
legislators take the money or and
 
02:15:16.990 --> 02:15:17.000 align:start position:0%
they're complicit in the same crimes as
 
02:15:19.990 --> 02:15:20.000 align:start position:0%
Congress so here's the
 
02:15:23.589 --> 02:15:23.599 align:start position:0%
thing um the States created the Federal
 
02:15:26.069 --> 02:15:26.079 align:start position:0%
Government they didn't create us so for
 
02:15:28.310 --> 02:15:28.320 align:start position:0%
us to go to them and ask for permission
 
02:15:30.430 --> 02:15:30.440 align:start position:0%
as to how we can conduct ourselves and
 
02:15:33.990 --> 02:15:34.000 align:start position:0%
where we get our freedom from is is a
 
02:15:37.589 --> 02:15:37.599 align:start position:0%
bad precedent okay so the states do have
 
02:15:40.950 --> 02:15:40.960 align:start position:0%
the uh the ability to push back on on
 
02:15:42.430 --> 02:15:42.440 align:start position:0%
the federal government it's called
 
02:15:45.149 --> 02:15:45.159 align:start position:0%
nullification article six so we should
 
02:15:48.790 --> 02:15:48.800 align:start position:0%
start trying to do that um
 
02:15:51.709 --> 02:15:51.719 align:start position:0%
so now when we talk about our delegates
 
02:15:54.549 --> 02:15:54.559 align:start position:0%
and people that are uh coming to this
 
02:15:56.510 --> 02:15:56.520 align:start position:0%
convention this whatever this limited
 
02:15:59.669 --> 02:15:59.679 align:start position:0%
convention that they're imagining um are
 
02:16:01.549 --> 02:16:01.559 align:start position:0%
they educated on the Constitution are
 
02:16:03.510 --> 02:16:03.520 align:start position:0%
they moral are they good people we don't
 
02:16:06.790 --> 02:16:06.800 align:start position:0%
know that we don't and and again once
 
02:16:08.270 --> 02:16:08.280 align:start position:0%
you know we're not insulting anybody by
 
02:16:09.629 --> 02:16:09.639 align:start position:0%
saying they're not educated on the
 
02:16:11.750 --> 02:16:11.760 align:start position:0%
Constitution but the simple fact is I've
 
02:16:13.669 --> 02:16:13.679 align:start position:0%
met many delegated partic delegates
 
02:16:16.149 --> 02:16:16.159 align:start position:0%
particularly in state of Maine and they
 
02:16:17.910 --> 02:16:17.920 align:start position:0%
don't know the Constitution at all to
 
02:16:20.830 --> 02:16:20.840 align:start position:0%
send these people to Washington to start
 
02:16:22.270 --> 02:16:22.280 align:start position:0%
talking about stuff that they don't know
 
02:16:24.430 --> 02:16:24.440 align:start position:0%
anything about um the other thing that I
 
02:16:27.669 --> 02:16:27.679 align:start position:0%
did notice too and um and initially I
 
02:16:29.270 --> 02:16:29.280 align:start position:0%
will be honest like a few years ago I
 
02:16:31.069 --> 02:16:31.079 align:start position:0%
was very interested in what cosos had to
 
02:16:32.830 --> 02:16:32.840 align:start position:0%
say but I started looking at some of the
 
02:16:35.709 --> 02:16:35.719 align:start position:0%
stuff that they were doing and in Maine
 
02:16:39.150 --> 02:16:39.160 align:start position:0%
where I'm from for instance like they
 
02:16:42.110 --> 02:16:42.120 align:start position:0%
literally try to pass like sp9 to change
 
02:16:45.709 --> 02:16:45.719 align:start position:0%
the rules for how you know a a bill
 
02:16:47.429 --> 02:16:47.439 align:start position:0%
could be passed so that they can push
 
02:16:49.190 --> 02:16:49.200 align:start position:0%
through in Article 5 you know get the
 
02:16:51.469 --> 02:16:51.479 align:start position:0%
Article 5 votes over there I mean so
 
02:16:53.190 --> 02:16:53.200 align:start position:0%
when Convention of States doesn't want
 
02:16:55.750 --> 02:16:55.760 align:start position:0%
get their way they'll sue the states
 
02:16:57.389 --> 02:16:57.399 align:start position:0%
like the state constitution like they're
 
02:16:59.509 --> 02:16:59.519 align:start position:0%
doing out in Kansas or they'll just
 
02:17:01.309 --> 02:17:01.319 align:start position:0%
change the rules to suit themselves to
 
02:17:03.910 --> 02:17:03.920 align:start position:0%
get what they want but here all the time
 
02:17:06.110 --> 02:17:06.120 align:start position:0%
they're boning the immorality of
 
02:17:08.349 --> 02:17:08.359 align:start position:0%
Congress Now isn't that something huh
 
02:17:10.830 --> 02:17:10.840 align:start position:0%
Congress is immoral all the time but
 
02:17:12.910 --> 02:17:12.920 align:start position:0%
somehow the states are not somehow
 
02:17:15.070 --> 02:17:15.080 align:start position:0%
complicit in things that are bad so I
 
02:17:16.950 --> 02:17:16.960 align:start position:0%
say I say to people you people here
 
02:17:18.309 --> 02:17:18.319 align:start position:0%
today uh
 
02:17:20.950 --> 02:17:20.960 align:start position:0%
and uh that maybe we could start looking
 
02:17:22.830 --> 02:17:22.840 align:start position:0%
at some of the solutions uh from our
 
02:17:24.469 --> 02:17:24.479 align:start position:0%
state level what we can do if we want to
 
02:17:26.629 --> 02:17:26.639 align:start position:0%
be fiscally responsible let's figure out
 
02:17:27.910 --> 02:17:27.920 align:start position:0%
ways to do that if we don't want the
 
02:17:29.870 --> 02:17:29.880 align:start position:0%
state to be a burden on the taxpayers
 
02:17:31.469 --> 02:17:31.479 align:start position:0%
let's figure out how we can do it at the
 
02:17:34.309 --> 02:17:34.319 align:start position:0%
state level but opening up the entire
 
02:17:37.110 --> 02:17:37.120 align:start position:0%
country to an article 5 convention is
 
02:17:39.910 --> 02:17:39.920 align:start position:0%
completely irresponsible considering the
 
02:17:41.870 --> 02:17:41.880 align:start position:0%
political climate that we're in today
 
02:17:44.429 --> 02:17:44.439 align:start position:0%
and um I want to thank you for letting
 
02:17:46.910 --> 02:17:46.920 align:start position:0%
me speak do you have any questions thank
 
02:17:49.230 --> 02:17:49.240 align:start position:0%
you Mr roads
 
02:17:51.629 --> 02:17:51.639 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none uh thank you for
 
02:17:51.639 --> 02:17:52.950 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none uh thank you for
traveling

02:17:52.950 --> 02:17:52.960 align:start position:0%
traveling
 
02:17:56.950 --> 02:17:56.960 align:start position:0%
here uh we still have uh four more cards
 
02:18:00.030 --> 02:18:00.040 align:start position:0%
um asking for three minutes five minutes
 
02:18:02.830 --> 02:18:02.840 align:start position:0%
uh two minutes and two minutes and uh
 
02:18:05.429 --> 02:18:05.439 align:start position:0%
again as I said before uh you do not
 
02:18:08.110 --> 02:18:08.120 align:start position:0%
need to we don't encourage repetition
 
02:18:10.910 --> 02:18:10.920 align:start position:0%
we're looking for some new thoughts and
 
02:18:13.589 --> 02:18:13.599 align:start position:0%
that said Anna Ben Ben aenas from
 
02:18:16.509 --> 02:18:16.519 align:start position:0%
conquer or Guilford I'm sorry Anna well
 
02:18:16.519 --> 02:18:19.030 align:start position:0%
conquer or Guilford I'm sorry Anna well
welcome

02:18:19.030 --> 02:18:19.040 align:start position:0%
welcome
 
02:18:24.589 --> 02:18:24.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:27.309 --> 02:18:27.319 align:start position:0%
AES um so I had something written down
 
02:18:29.950 --> 02:18:29.960 align:start position:0%
but kind of everybody else said who's in
 
02:18:33.429 --> 02:18:33.439 align:start position:0%
favor of this said what I wanted to say
 
02:18:38.030 --> 02:18:38.040 align:start position:0%
um except that um I'm a mom of a
 
02:18:41.429 --> 02:18:41.439 align:start position:0%
16-year-old I am a school librarian and
 
02:18:44.709 --> 02:18:44.719 align:start position:0%
um regarding comments about experts um I
 
02:18:46.469 --> 02:18:46.479 align:start position:0%
was just looking up the definition back
 
02:18:48.389 --> 02:18:48.399 align:start position:0%
there and it doesn't mean that that they
 
02:18:52.230 --> 02:18:52.240 align:start position:0%
are the Beall end all of everything and
 
02:18:53.990 --> 02:18:54.000 align:start position:0%
perfect people who know exactly what
 
02:18:55.910 --> 02:18:55.920 align:start position:0%
they are but they are very people who
 
02:18:59.469 --> 02:18:59.479 align:start position:0%
are experts in something are very
 
02:19:03.230 --> 02:19:03.240 align:start position:0%
um they've researched which is the whole
 
02:19:05.150 --> 02:19:05.160 align:start position:0%
thing about being a librarian and you
 
02:19:06.429 --> 02:19:06.439 align:start position:0%
know while going to grad school I
 
02:19:08.150 --> 02:19:08.160 align:start position:0%
learned the critical importance of
 
02:19:12.030 --> 02:19:12.040 align:start position:0%
careful and unbiased research and
 
02:19:15.950 --> 02:19:15.960 align:start position:0%
um I wanted to say also that I feel this
 
02:19:19.270 --> 02:19:19.280 align:start position:0%
is a big problem I don't know a lot
 
02:19:22.309 --> 02:19:22.319 align:start position:0%
about the political system I'm a very
 
02:19:25.750 --> 02:19:25.760 align:start position:0%
skeptical person and my husband and I um
 
02:19:27.389 --> 02:19:27.399 align:start position:0%
he's part of an organization who
 
02:19:30.469 --> 02:19:30.479 align:start position:0%
supports this this resolution as well
 
02:19:32.270 --> 02:19:32.280 align:start position:0%
and we will have conversations where I
 
02:19:33.709 --> 02:19:33.719 align:start position:0%
will constantly play The Devil's
 
02:19:37.030 --> 02:19:37.040 align:start position:0%
Advocate because that's just how I am um
 
02:19:40.870 --> 02:19:40.880 align:start position:0%
and he'll throw back data data data and
 
02:19:42.509 --> 02:19:42.519 align:start position:0%
although I don't ConEd at the dinner
 
02:19:45.110 --> 02:19:45.120 align:start position:0%
table I have to say now that he
 
02:19:48.230 --> 02:19:48.240 align:start position:0%
definitely has researched and he is an
 
02:19:50.910 --> 02:19:50.920 align:start position:0%
expert in this
 
02:19:55.309 --> 02:19:55.319 align:start position:0%
um a big problem requires a big solution
 
02:19:59.309 --> 02:19:59.319 align:start position:0%
I have never known where to turn um in
 
02:20:01.389 --> 02:20:01.399 align:start position:0%
order to help with something like this
 
02:20:06.550 --> 02:20:06.560 align:start position:0%
so I thank my husband as well as his
 
02:20:08.910 --> 02:20:08.920 align:start position:0%

other people who volunteer and support
 
02:20:14.910 --> 02:20:14.920 align:start position:0%
this resolution because um I trust in
 
02:20:16.270 --> 02:20:16.280 align:start position:0%
what they have said because I've seen
 
02:20:18.910 --> 02:20:18.920 align:start position:0%
the research what in the research that
 
02:20:21.230 --> 02:20:21.240 align:start position:0%
they have done over many many years I
 
02:20:24.910 --> 02:20:24.920 align:start position:0%
think 9 years is how long um some of the
 
02:20:27.550 --> 02:20:27.560 align:start position:0%
people I know who have told me about
 
02:20:30.070 --> 02:20:30.080 align:start position:0%
these things have been in it um I just
 
02:20:35.309 --> 02:20:35.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:38.270 --> 02:20:38.280 align:start position:0%

probably already do but I feel that that
 
02:21:19.990 --> 02:21:20.000 align:start position:0%
a lot of times um
 
02:21:23.349 --> 02:21:23.359 align:start position:0%
opinions get in the way and that no
 
02:21:26.670 --> 02:21:26.680 align:start position:0%
matter where we are um we should rely on
 
02:21:29.990 --> 02:21:30.000 align:start position:0%

02:22:14.950 --> 02:22:14.960 align:start position:0%
I'm from Guilford resident of Guilford
 
02:22:17.910 --> 02:22:17.920 align:start position:0%
um I think it was in 200 8 when I
 
02:22:19.750 --> 02:22:19.760 align:start position:0%
finally realized how corrupt our
 
02:22:21.990 --> 02:22:22.000 align:start position:0%
government really was um that our
 
02:22:24.389 --> 02:22:24.399 align:start position:0%
federal politicians are charged with
 
02:22:26.870 --> 02:22:26.880 align:start position:0%
representing us were representing a
 
02:22:29.309 --> 02:22:29.319 align:start position:0%
specific population of people that could
 
02:22:32.070 --> 02:22:32.080 align:start position:0%
uh spend billions in elections to buy
 
02:22:34.830 --> 02:22:34.840 align:start position:0%
them um so I began searching for
 
02:22:37.070 --> 02:22:37.080 align:start position:0%
organizations that were trying to fight
 
02:22:39.870 --> 02:22:39.880 align:start position:0%
back um and after looking at many of
 
02:22:42.070 --> 02:22:42.080 align:start position:0%
them I found Wolfpack uh this
 
02:22:44.750 --> 02:22:44.760 align:start position:0%
organization stood out to me as having
 
02:22:47.270 --> 02:22:47.280 align:start position:0%
the most effective and verified method
 
02:22:49.230 --> 02:22:49.240 align:start position:0%
of getting the change to amend the
 
02:22:51.429 --> 02:22:51.439 align:start position:0%
Constitution to uh address this
 
02:22:53.710 --> 02:22:53.720 align:start position:0%
corrupting influence
 
02:22:56.110 --> 02:22:56.120 align:start position:0%
um uh and they do it by using the
 
02:22:58.990 --> 02:22:59.000 align:start position:0%
Article 5 convention process now being a
 
02:23:00.990 --> 02:23:01.000 align:start position:0%
former librarian I did not take what
 
02:23:02.830 --> 02:23:02.840 align:start position:0%
they said at face value I needed to do
 
02:23:05.030 --> 02:23:05.040 align:start position:0%
the research myself I needed to back up
 
02:23:07.070 --> 02:23:07.080 align:start position:0%
what they were saying by reading the
 
02:23:09.630 --> 02:23:09.640 align:start position:0%
Articles um so I started doing my own
 
02:23:13.190 --> 02:23:13.200 align:start position:0%
research and after going through many
 
02:23:15.150 --> 02:23:15.160 align:start position:0%
many peer-reviewed articles and getting
 
02:23:17.389 --> 02:23:17.399 align:start position:0%
crosseyed at all the reports that been
 
02:23:19.070 --> 02:23:19.080 align:start position:0%
written on this subject that are peer-
 
02:23:22.910 --> 02:23:22.920 align:start position:0%
reviewed that have been reviewed by uh
 
02:23:26.309 --> 02:23:26.319 align:start position:0%
experts Congressional researchers um I
 
02:23:28.030 --> 02:23:28.040 align:start position:0%
found out that there was a common theme
 
02:23:30.469 --> 02:23:30.479 align:start position:0%
among all of them that although there
 
02:23:33.110 --> 02:23:33.120 align:start position:0%
was opposition this is a safe process
 
02:23:34.990 --> 02:23:35.000 align:start position:0%
and even though it's never been used it
 
02:23:37.469 --> 02:23:37.479 align:start position:0%
will go exactly the way that we think it
 
02:23:40.990 --> 02:23:41.000 align:start position:0%
will it will go it will propose an
 
02:23:43.630 --> 02:23:43.640 align:start position:0%
amendment and it will be ratified and
 
02:23:44.830 --> 02:23:44.840 align:start position:0%
that's how it was that was the
 
02:23:46.790 --> 02:23:46.800 align:start position:0%
conclusion of every single one there is
 
02:23:48.750 --> 02:23:48.760 align:start position:0%
I could could not find I searched I
 
02:23:51.710 --> 02:23:51.720 align:start position:0%
could not find one peer-reviewed article
 
02:23:53.550 --> 02:23:53.560 align:start position:0%
that said that this would go off the
 
02:23:55.469 --> 02:23:55.479 align:start position:0%
rails that it would get out of control
 
02:23:57.110 --> 02:23:57.120 align:start position:0%
that would rewrite the Constitution that
 
02:23:58.630 --> 02:23:58.640 align:start position:0%
it would be able to ratify at the
 
02:24:00.870 --> 02:24:00.880 align:start position:0%
convention there's not one that says
 
02:24:04.150 --> 02:24:04.160 align:start position:0%
that um all those are books opinion
 
02:24:07.710 --> 02:24:07.720 align:start position:0%
articles op-eds at which do not go to
 
02:24:10.230 --> 02:24:10.240 align:start position:0%
peer-reviewed process and do not go
 
02:24:12.510 --> 02:24:12.520 align:start position:0%
before researchers and as they said in
 
02:24:14.070 --> 02:24:14.080 align:start position:0%
those peer-reviewed articles that is
 
02:24:16.309 --> 02:24:16.319 align:start position:0%
because in order to make that argument
 
02:24:18.750 --> 02:24:18.760 align:start position:0%
you have to ignore more history fact and
 
02:24:22.590 --> 02:24:22.600 align:start position:0%
precedent in all those cases so um I
 
02:24:24.190 --> 02:24:24.200 align:start position:0%
would just I would implore you to look
 
02:24:27.150 --> 02:24:27.160 align:start position:0%
at some of that research um in doing so
 
02:24:29.190 --> 02:24:29.200 align:start position:0%
furthermore it has been proven tool to
 
02:24:31.389 --> 02:24:31.399 align:start position:0%
put pressure on Congress as our Prime
 
02:24:33.590 --> 02:24:33.600 align:start position:0%
sponsor said during the 17th Amendment
 
02:24:36.790 --> 02:24:36.800 align:start position:0%
it was used effectively almost every
 
02:24:38.990 --> 02:24:39.000 align:start position:0%
movement in this country in the past has
 
02:24:41.389 --> 02:24:41.399 align:start position:0%
used this method as part of putting
 
02:24:42.950 --> 02:24:42.960 align:start position:0%
pressure on Congress the women's
 
02:24:44.710 --> 02:24:44.720 align:start position:0%
suffrage movement the Civil Rights
 
02:24:47.190 --> 02:24:47.200 align:start position:0%
Movement all of them used Article 5 five
 
02:24:50.510 --> 02:24:50.520 align:start position:0%
convention calls to as an addition
 
02:24:53.309 --> 02:24:53.319 align:start position:0%
strategy to make their point and to get
 
02:24:55.630 --> 02:24:55.640 align:start position:0%
Congress to do what they wanted to
 
02:24:55.640 --> 02:24:57.150 align:start position:0%
Congress to do what they wanted to
do

02:24:57.150 --> 02:24:57.160 align:start position:0%
do
 
02:25:00.510 --> 02:25:00.520 align:start position:0%
um as my wife you know she gives me too
 
02:25:02.670 --> 02:25:02.680 align:start position:0%
much credit I'm not an expert in this
 
02:25:04.790 --> 02:25:04.800 align:start position:0%
field at all I've done a lot of research
 
02:25:06.510 --> 02:25:06.520 align:start position:0%
but I'm not an expert I don't propose to
 
02:25:08.590 --> 02:25:08.600 align:start position:0%
be an expert I thank her though for for
 
02:25:11.790 --> 02:25:11.800 align:start position:0%
her faith in me um and for the last nine
 
02:25:15.429 --> 02:25:15.439 align:start position:0%
years I have um you know I've been
 
02:25:17.150 --> 02:25:17.160 align:start position:0%
working on this issue I've been vol
 
02:25:19.510 --> 02:25:19.520 align:start position:0%
ering with Wolfpack I first testified in
 
02:25:21.830 --> 02:25:21.840 align:start position:0%
front of this committee uh when my child
 
02:25:25.910 --> 02:25:25.920 align:start position:0%
was 7 years old and I had the naive hope
 
02:25:28.190 --> 02:25:28.200 align:start position:0%
that some change would happen by the
 
02:25:30.429 --> 02:25:30.439 align:start position:0%
time they reached voting
 
02:25:35.070 --> 02:25:35.080 align:start position:0%
age um and unfortunately uh they are 16
 
02:25:37.429 --> 02:25:37.439 align:start position:0%
now and this problem has only gotten
 
02:25:40.910 --> 02:25:40.920 align:start position:0%
worse um I've you know we've received
 
02:25:43.389 --> 02:25:43.399 align:start position:0%
empty promises of change symbolic
 
02:25:46.190 --> 02:25:46.200 align:start position:0%
gestures that really make no difference
 
02:25:46.200 --> 02:25:47.550 align:start position:0%
gestures that really make no difference
um

02:25:47.550 --> 02:25:47.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:25:50.429 --> 02:25:50.439 align:start position:0%
you know the illusion of change so you
 
02:25:52.349 --> 02:25:52.359 align:start position:0%
might ask why am I still here why am I
 
02:25:55.429 --> 02:25:55.439 align:start position:0%
why do I keep fighting and the truth is
 
02:25:58.150 --> 02:25:58.160 align:start position:0%
it's for them um so I can look into my
 
02:26:00.910 --> 02:26:00.920 align:start position:0%
child's eyes and tell them that I did
 
02:26:04.190 --> 02:26:04.200 align:start position:0%
everything at my disposal to try to fix
 
02:26:08.309 --> 02:26:08.319 align:start position:0%
this problem for them and I hope that
 
02:26:10.510 --> 02:26:10.520 align:start position:0%
you can stay this say the same after
 
02:26:12.510 --> 02:26:12.520 align:start position:0%
this I hope that you are using every
 
02:26:15.269 --> 02:26:15.279 align:start position:0%
method at your disposal to get this
 
02:26:17.550 --> 02:26:17.560 align:start position:0%
problem fixed for the people of New
 
02:26:21.110 --> 02:26:21.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um so in closing um I'll leave
 
02:26:23.910 --> 02:26:23.920 align:start position:0%
the committee with a final word urgency
 
02:26:26.790 --> 02:26:26.800 align:start position:0%
every day we do not act our Democratic
 
02:26:29.269 --> 02:26:29.279 align:start position:0%
Republic slips a little further away
 
02:26:32.309 --> 02:26:32.319 align:start position:0%
from us every day we allow lobbyists to
 
02:26:35.950 --> 02:26:35.960 align:start position:0%
roam these Halls uh or special interests
 
02:26:37.990 --> 02:26:38.000 align:start position:0%
to drown out the voices of American
 
02:26:40.590 --> 02:26:40.600 align:start position:0%
systems with buckets of money uh we
 
02:26:42.710 --> 02:26:42.720 align:start position:0%
break our Oaths and pledges to The
 
02:26:45.230 --> 02:26:45.240 align:start position:0%
Republic and to our democracy I
 
02:26:48.070 --> 02:26:48.080 align:start position:0%
respectfully urge you to to pass this
 
02:26:50.349 --> 02:26:50.359 align:start position:0%
important legislation out of committee
 
02:26:52.110 --> 02:26:52.120 align:start position:0%
and again I thank the committee for its
 
02:26:54.550 --> 02:26:54.560 align:start position:0%

Navy veteran I've been a resident of
 
02:27:33.790 --> 02:27:33.800 align:start position:0%
stem New Hampshire for over 50 years um
 
02:27:35.630 --> 02:27:35.640 align:start position:0%
I hadn't plan on speaking today and I
 
02:27:37.190 --> 02:27:37.200 align:start position:0%
just heard so many comments that I
 
02:27:39.070 --> 02:27:39.080 align:start position:0%
thought maybe I could contribute to
 
02:27:42.950 --> 02:27:42.960 align:start position:0%
simplify it a bit all all the fear about
 
02:27:44.190 --> 02:27:44.200 align:start position:0%
what would happen would there be a
 
02:27:47.030 --> 02:27:47.040 align:start position:0%
runaway convention or delegate it's not
 
02:27:49.309 --> 02:27:49.319 align:start position:0%
going to follow the rules that they have
 
02:27:50.510 --> 02:27:50.520 align:start position:0%
when you come down to it it really
 
02:27:50.520 --> 02:27:51.550 align:start position:0%
when you come down to it it really
doesn't

02:27:51.550 --> 02:27:51.560 align:start position:0%
doesn't
 
02:27:55.630 --> 02:27:55.640 align:start position:0%
matter uh Article 5 gives the authority
 
02:27:58.550 --> 02:27:58.560 align:start position:0%
to propose amendments it doesn't matter
 
02:28:01.030 --> 02:28:01.040 align:start position:0%
how the delegates are chosen it doesn't
 
02:28:03.269 --> 02:28:03.279 align:start position:0%
matter what they vote on and how they do
 
02:28:05.750 --> 02:28:05.760 align:start position:0%
make their rules uh the House of
 
02:28:07.550 --> 02:28:07.560 align:start position:0%
Representatives makes its own rules the
 
02:28:09.630 --> 02:28:09.640 align:start position:0%
Senate makes its own rules it's not done
 
02:28:12.190 --> 02:28:12.200 align:start position:0%
by the federal government Article 5 is
 
02:28:14.110 --> 02:28:14.120 align:start position:0%
to bypass the government because the
 
02:28:16.630 --> 02:28:16.640 align:start position:0%
government at this point to have an AR
 
02:28:19.070 --> 02:28:19.080 align:start position:0%
Article 5 is shown that they're unable
 
02:28:22.590 --> 02:28:22.600 align:start position:0%
to do the job but no matter what it's
 
02:28:24.870 --> 02:28:24.880 align:start position:0%
proposed I can propose an amendment now
 
02:28:26.710 --> 02:28:26.720 align:start position:0%
I can go to my legislature and propose
 
02:28:29.269 --> 02:28:29.279 align:start position:0%
an amendment anybody can propose an
 
02:28:32.790 --> 02:28:32.800 align:start position:0%
amendment all Article 5 convention does
 
02:28:35.550 --> 02:28:35.560 align:start position:0%
is propos amendments the final decision
 
02:28:38.950 --> 02:28:38.960 align:start position:0%
is made by the states you have to get 38
 
02:28:41.429 --> 02:28:41.439 align:start position:0%
of the 50 states to agree to what was
 
02:28:43.269 --> 02:28:43.279 align:start position:0%
done it doesn't matter how it was done
 
02:28:46.670 --> 02:28:46.680 align:start position:0%
or who proposed it but these people at
 
02:28:49.070 --> 02:28:49.080 align:start position:0%
invention going to come to some
 
02:28:51.910 --> 02:28:51.920 align:start position:0%
agreement and there's two ways to make
 
02:28:54.389 --> 02:28:54.399 align:start position:0%
an amendment Congress could do it and if
 
02:28:56.070 --> 02:28:56.080 align:start position:0%
Congress doesn't do it then the
 
02:28:58.309 --> 02:28:58.319 align:start position:0%
convention of states can do it there's a
 
02:29:01.429 --> 02:29:01.439 align:start position:0%
movement of Convention of states and
 
02:29:03.150 --> 02:29:03.160 align:start position:0%
hopefully Congress will turn around and
 
02:29:04.790 --> 02:29:04.800 align:start position:0%
do something as a result of that some
 
02:29:07.190 --> 02:29:07.200 align:start position:0%
bills have passed in that
 
02:29:11.790 --> 02:29:11.800 align:start position:0%
manner if of the two ways of proposing a
 
02:29:13.750 --> 02:29:13.760 align:start position:0%
bill Congress could write it or the
 
02:29:15.950 --> 02:29:15.960 align:start position:0%
convention of States could write it if
 
02:29:17.950 --> 02:29:17.960 align:start position:0%
Congress writes it it's probably going
 
02:29:17.960 --> 02:29:18.670 align:start position:0%
Congress writes it it's probably going
to

02:29:18.670 --> 02:29:18.680 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:29:21.870 --> 02:29:21.880 align:start position:0%
have uh exceptions for them they'll have
 
02:29:23.790 --> 02:29:23.800 align:start position:0%
this doesn't happen until some effective
 
02:29:25.950 --> 02:29:25.960 align:start position:0%
date but they'll write it into to
 
02:29:29.950 --> 02:29:29.960 align:start position:0%
maintain their own uh Powers if it's
 
02:29:31.670 --> 02:29:31.680 align:start position:0%
done by a Convention of States you've
 
02:29:33.630 --> 02:29:33.640 align:start position:0%
got a group of representatives from 50
 
02:29:35.950 --> 02:29:35.960 align:start position:0%
people no matter how they were chosen
 
02:29:37.590 --> 02:29:37.600 align:start position:0%
they don't have rules because they're
 
02:29:39.550 --> 02:29:39.560 align:start position:0%
going to make their own rules they're
 
02:29:41.710 --> 02:29:41.720 align:start position:0%
going to elect their offices that's the
 
02:29:43.590 --> 02:29:43.600 align:start position:0%
way State conventions have done in the
 
02:29:45.990 --> 02:29:46.000 align:start position:0%
past they're going to select their own
 
02:29:47.790 --> 02:29:47.800 align:start position:0%
rules the simulation that was done in
 
02:29:49.429 --> 02:29:49.439 align:start position:0%
August proved this and the people that
 
02:29:51.269 --> 02:29:51.279 align:start position:0%
went to that had an opportunity to see
 
02:29:53.870 --> 02:29:53.880 align:start position:0%
it so the convention of states is
 
02:29:56.389 --> 02:29:56.399 align:start position:0%
powerless they cannot make a law they
 
02:29:57.630 --> 02:29:57.640 align:start position:0%
cannot make an
 
02:29:59.950 --> 02:29:59.960 align:start position:0%
amendment you don't need permission from
 
02:30:01.269 --> 02:30:01.279 align:start position:0%
the government to throw out the
 
02:30:03.230 --> 02:30:03.240 align:start position:0%
government you write a new Declaration
 
02:30:05.429 --> 02:30:05.439 align:start position:0%
of Independence we're not controlled by
 
02:30:07.349 --> 02:30:07.359 align:start position:0%
the Declaration that was our
 
02:30:09.110 --> 02:30:09.120 align:start position:0%
justification for having the
 
02:30:11.870 --> 02:30:11.880 align:start position:0%
Constitution we're controlled by the
 
02:30:14.429 --> 02:30:14.439 align:start position:0%
Constitution that's all I have I'll
 
02:30:19.309 --> 02:30:19.319 align:start position:0%
answer any questions thank you Mr Hansen
 
02:30:22.830 --> 02:30:22.840 align:start position:0%

welcome well hello my name is deshun
 
02:30:54.670 --> 02:30:54.680 align:start position:0%
Oliver and I'm a citizen here in New
 
02:30:56.910 --> 02:30:56.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire for two years now uh as you
 
02:30:59.309 --> 02:30:59.319 align:start position:0%
may know I'm here to speak to you all on
 
02:31:01.990 --> 02:31:02.000 align:start position:0%
house resolution 9 which is Article 5
 
02:31:06.550 --> 02:31:06.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:09.269 --> 02:31:09.279 align:start position:0%
con I'm
 
02:31:12.550 --> 02:31:12.560 align:start position:0%
sorry oh sorry I misread I misspoke
 
02:31:15.389 --> 02:31:15.399 align:start position:0%
sorry house resolution nine sorry okay
 
02:31:17.070 --> 02:31:17.080 align:start position:0%
eight okay
 
02:31:18.309 --> 02:31:18.319 align:start position:0%
you want to speak to eight cuz we're
 
02:31:20.750 --> 02:31:20.760 align:start position:0%
going to do nine in just a bit okay
 
02:31:23.910 --> 02:31:23.920 align:start position:0%
Carry On eight sorry I misspoke um
 
02:31:26.630 --> 02:31:26.640 align:start position:0%
whatever you like to call it this is
 
02:31:28.469 --> 02:31:28.479 align:start position:0%
this would allow delegates or otherwise
 
02:31:30.910 --> 02:31:30.920 align:start position:0%
to amend the Constitution I truly
 
02:31:33.950 --> 02:31:33.960 align:start position:0%
believe passing house resolution 8 is a
 
02:31:36.110 --> 02:31:36.120 align:start position:0%
mistake especially since over the course
 
02:31:37.710 --> 02:31:37.720 align:start position:0%
of the past Century all three branches
 
02:31:39.630 --> 02:31:39.640 align:start position:0%
of the federal government executive
 
02:31:41.790 --> 02:31:41.800 align:start position:0%
judicial and legislative branch has
 
02:31:44.190 --> 02:31:44.200 align:start position:0%
vastly expanded their powers amending
 
02:31:45.990 --> 02:31:46.000 align:start position:0%
the Constitution today will most
 
02:31:47.389 --> 02:31:47.399 align:start position:0%
certainly result in our god-given
 
02:31:49.510 --> 02:31:49.520 align:start position:0%
liberties being Stripped Away a most
 
02:31:51.309 --> 02:31:51.319 align:start position:0%
recent example of this would be
 
02:31:54.309 --> 02:31:54.319 align:start position:0%
political martyr Douglas Mackey Douglas
 
02:31:55.750 --> 02:31:55.760 align:start position:0%
Mackey was a political prisoner for
 
02:31:57.910 --> 02:31:57.920 align:start position:0%
seven months for simply posting memes
 
02:32:00.309 --> 02:32:00.319 align:start position:0%
about Hillary Clinton in 2016 his speech
 
02:32:01.790 --> 02:32:01.800 align:start position:0%
was meant to be protected under the
 
02:32:03.790 --> 02:32:03.800 align:start position:0%
First Amendment this is merely one
 
02:32:06.710 --> 02:32:06.720 align:start position:0%
example amongst many others Free Speech
 
02:32:08.630 --> 02:32:08.640 align:start position:0%
religion privacy gun rights and many
 
02:32:10.510 --> 02:32:10.520 align:start position:0%
more of our constitutional rights are
 
02:32:12.550 --> 02:32:12.560 align:start position:0%
being violated because of big government
 
02:32:14.550 --> 02:32:14.560 align:start position:0%
the entire purpose of the Constitution
 
02:32:17.469 --> 02:32:17.479 align:start position:0%
is meant to keep the government small
 
02:32:20.469 --> 02:32:20.479 align:start position:0%
enough to not violate our rights but big
 
02:32:23.150 --> 02:32:23.160 align:start position:0%
enough to enforce them if Article 5
 
02:32:25.830 --> 02:32:25.840 align:start position:0%
convention were to occur we would have a
 
02:32:27.389 --> 02:32:27.399 align:start position:0%
gathering of delegates from all 50
 
02:32:28.910 --> 02:32:28.920 align:start position:0%
states for the purpose of proposing
 
02:32:30.990 --> 02:32:31.000 align:start position:0%
amendments to the Constitution who will
 
02:32:32.830 --> 02:32:32.840 align:start position:0%
the delegates
 
02:32:35.309 --> 02:32:35.319 align:start position:0%
be who are the delegates who will they
 
02:32:37.150 --> 02:32:37.160 align:start position:0%
be and are they Constitution
 
02:32:39.190 --> 02:32:39.200 align:start position:0%
constitutionally minded these are all
 
02:32:41.510 --> 02:32:41.520 align:start position:0%
legitimate questions another danger and
 
02:32:42.870 --> 02:32:42.880 align:start position:0%
probably the most dangerous is that we
 
02:32:45.630 --> 02:32:45.640 align:start position:0%
could see a runaway convention consider
 
02:32:48.870 --> 02:32:48.880 align:start position:0%
the constit tional convention in 1787
 
02:32:50.750 --> 02:32:50.760 align:start position:0%
they did not stop revising the Articles
 
02:32:52.309 --> 02:32:52.319 align:start position:0%
of Confederation they simply they
 
02:32:55.030 --> 02:32:55.040 align:start position:0%
completely rewrote them a total rewrite
 
02:32:55.040 --> 02:32:56.150 align:start position:0%
completely rewrote them a total rewrite
in

02:32:56.150 --> 02:32:56.160 align:start position:0%
in
 
02:32:58.870 --> 02:32:58.880 align:start position:0%
1787 may have been needed but under the
 
02:33:00.870 --> 02:33:00.880 align:start position:0%
current political climate today could
 
02:33:05.349 --> 02:33:05.359 align:start position:0%
spark a political collapse we do not
 
02:33:07.630 --> 02:33:07.640 align:start position:0%
have the Statesmen of the past we have
 
02:33:09.309 --> 02:33:09.319 align:start position:0%
politicians of the president of the
 
02:33:11.830 --> 02:33:11.840 align:start position:0%
present that helped create the mess we
 
02:33:14.590 --> 02:33:14.600 align:start position:0%
are in now ask yourself is the
 
02:33:17.510 --> 02:33:17.520 align:start position:0%
Constitution truly the problem or is it
 
02:33:19.550 --> 02:33:19.560 align:start position:0%
the outof control federal government
 
02:33:21.469 --> 02:33:21.479 align:start position:0%
that ignores the Constitution as it
 
02:33:23.990 --> 02:33:24.000 align:start position:0%
stands today thank
 
02:33:28.110 --> 02:33:28.120 align:start position:0%
you thank you for coming up uh qu
 
02:33:34.429 --> 02:33:34.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:38.670 --> 02:33:38.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:41.950 --> 02:33:41.960 align:start position:0%
work sorry yes I'm sorry can I ask who
 
02:33:45.150 --> 02:33:45.160 align:start position:0%
you work for um I'm with the John bur
 
02:33:45.160 --> 02:33:47.510 align:start position:0%
you work for um I'm with the John bur
Society

02:33:47.510 --> 02:33:47.520 align:start position:0%
Society
 
02:33:50.710 --> 02:33:50.720 align:start position:0%
thank you other
 
02:33:52.870 --> 02:33:52.880 align:start position:0%
questions okay we have one more pink
 
02:33:57.030 --> 02:33:57.040 align:start position:0%
card uh also from uh representing
 
02:33:59.269 --> 02:33:59.279 align:start position:0%
Wolfpack asking for three minutes in
 
02:34:02.150 --> 02:34:02.160 align:start position:0%
support of the bill is Sam Fel Felman
 
02:34:05.550 --> 02:34:05.560 align:start position:0%
Sam has been here before uh Sam Sam up
 
02:34:07.309 --> 02:34:07.319 align:start position:0%
to three minutes uh if you have
 
02:34:08.550 --> 02:34:08.560 align:start position:0%
presumably you have something we haven't
 
02:34:12.590 --> 02:34:12.600 align:start position:0%
heard yet uh so uh welcome uh thank you
 
02:34:14.710 --> 02:34:14.720 align:start position:0%
very much and I appreciate your time uh
 
02:34:16.710 --> 02:34:16.720 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and members of the committee
 
02:34:19.910 --> 02:34:19.920 align:start position:0%
um I've been as I said I've been you
 
02:34:22.269 --> 02:34:22.279 align:start position:0%
said I've been here before uh last year
 
02:34:25.510 --> 02:34:25.520 align:start position:0%
talking about uh delegate uh bills and
 
02:34:26.910 --> 02:34:26.920 align:start position:0%
and others as
 
02:34:29.150 --> 02:34:29.160 align:start position:0%
well and the reason why I started
 
02:34:30.790 --> 02:34:30.800 align:start position:0%
working with Wolfpack originally why I
 
02:34:32.710 --> 02:34:32.720 align:start position:0%
originally got into this was for two
 
02:34:34.510 --> 02:34:34.520 align:start position:0%
reasons their names are Hannah and Jenny
 
02:34:37.510 --> 02:34:37.520 align:start position:0%
they're my twin daughters uh this was in
 
02:34:40.870 --> 02:34:40.880 align:start position:0%
uh 2011 shortly before they were born um
 
02:34:42.710 --> 02:34:42.720 align:start position:0%
and I started researching this process
 
02:34:44.429 --> 02:34:44.439 align:start position:0%
trying to find a way to ensure that they
 
02:34:46.790 --> 02:34:46.800 align:start position:0%
would grow up in a world where they
 
02:34:48.389 --> 02:34:48.399 align:start position:0%
actually had some say in how their
 
02:34:50.510 --> 02:34:50.520 align:start position:0%
government would work uh that they're
 
02:34:54.469 --> 02:34:54.479 align:start position:0%
now 12 years old and that and I'm still
 
02:34:57.910 --> 02:34:57.920 align:start position:0%
working on that in that time uh I've uh
 
02:35:00.429 --> 02:35:00.439 align:start position:0%
spoken I've read an enormous amount of
 
02:35:03.710 --> 02:35:03.720 align:start position:0%
research I've spoken to experts such as
 
02:35:06.590 --> 02:35:06.600 align:start position:0%
uh John Kaminsky uh John FK whose
 
02:35:09.389 --> 02:35:09.399 align:start position:0%
testimony you can read in Mr Sheriff's
 
02:35:12.150 --> 02:35:12.160 align:start position:0%
uh giant PDF he testified before that uh
 
02:35:16.030 --> 02:35:16.040 align:start position:0%
Committee in the Senate um uh Larry leig
 
02:35:19.110 --> 02:35:19.120 align:start position:0%
Rob nen Michael Stern uh every one of
 
02:35:21.590 --> 02:35:21.600 align:start position:0%
them also recognizes me as an expert and
 
02:35:23.550 --> 02:35:23.560 align:start position:0%
the expert that I've become over that
 
02:35:25.150 --> 02:35:25.160 align:start position:0%
time in Reading thousands and thousands
 
02:35:27.469 --> 02:35:27.479 align:start position:0%
of pages about this process and the one
 
02:35:28.910 --> 02:35:28.920 align:start position:0%
argument that I've never heard in all of
 
02:35:32.510 --> 02:35:32.520 align:start position:0%
that time is that I don't exist um so
 
02:35:36.550 --> 02:35:36.560 align:start position:0%
that was a new one but um the the
 
02:35:38.870 --> 02:35:38.880 align:start position:0%
process of the convention that that we
 
02:35:42.670 --> 02:35:42.680 align:start position:0%
see uh is not limited to just that one
 
02:35:45.750 --> 02:35:45.760 align:start position:0%
brief line in uh in the US Constitution
 
02:35:48.910 --> 02:35:48.920 align:start position:0%
the structure of the Constitution itself
 
02:35:50.630 --> 02:35:50.640 align:start position:0%
um has baked into it a system of
 
02:35:52.710 --> 02:35:52.720 align:start position:0%
federalism that I've testified about to
 
02:35:55.590 --> 02:35:55.600 align:start position:0%
you before that ensures a safety net
 
02:35:57.110 --> 02:35:57.120 align:start position:0%
with different parts of the process
 
02:35:58.510 --> 02:35:58.520 align:start position:0%
being given to different branches of
 
02:36:00.590 --> 02:36:00.600 align:start position:0%
government at different levels in the
 
02:36:04.469 --> 02:36:04.479 align:start position:0%
state and federal uh level um and um
 
02:36:07.230 --> 02:36:07.240 align:start position:0%
will happily send uh you can see a great
 
02:36:09.830 --> 02:36:09.840 align:start position:0%
deal of uh of the research cited and
 
02:36:12.590 --> 02:36:12.600 align:start position:0%
link to at wolfpack.com review which I
 
02:36:13.950 --> 02:36:13.960 align:start position:0%
will send out and make available to the
 
02:36:16.830 --> 02:36:16.840 align:start position:0%
committee um I will also send that to uh
 
02:36:19.910 --> 02:36:19.920 align:start position:0%
to miss Dyer who uh is the committee um
 
02:36:21.710 --> 02:36:21.720 align:start position:0%
researcher and I will also send her as
 
02:36:24.870 --> 02:36:24.880 align:start position:0%
you requested uh there's a 1938 uh
 
02:36:27.309 --> 02:36:27.319 align:start position:0%
primary source compendium on the uh
 
02:36:29.150 --> 02:36:29.160 align:start position:0%
ratification conventions and I will send
 
02:36:32.349 --> 02:36:32.359 align:start position:0%
her that and I've read extensively on
 
02:36:37.230 --> 02:36:37.240 align:start position:0%
those as well and uh the concept of um
 
02:36:38.670 --> 02:36:38.680 align:start position:0%
restricting delegates in fact the
 
02:36:42.870 --> 02:36:42.880 align:start position:0%
delegate uh uh limitation bill that this
 
02:36:45.150 --> 02:36:45.160 align:start position:0%
committee passed last year was based in
 
02:36:47.469 --> 02:36:47.479 align:start position:0%
a large part on the language that came
 
02:36:51.910 --> 02:36:51.920 align:start position:0%
out of the uh Article 5 uh uh proposing
 
02:36:53.510 --> 02:36:53.520 align:start position:0%
Convent Article 5 ratification
 
02:36:55.590 --> 02:36:55.600 align:start position:0%
conventions that we had in
 
02:36:58.070 --> 02:36:58.080 align:start position:0%
1933 uh those were for the 21st
 
02:37:00.190 --> 02:37:00.200 align:start position:0%
amendment not the 18th as was previously
 
02:37:03.510 --> 02:37:03.520 align:start position:0%
stated um and that process showed used
 
02:37:05.710 --> 02:37:05.720 align:start position:0%
limitations to make sure that the people
 
02:37:07.429 --> 02:37:07.439 align:start position:0%
could vote on
 
02:37:10.309 --> 02:37:10.319 align:start position:0%
resolution people could vote for uh for
 
02:37:13.110 --> 02:37:13.120 align:start position:0%
or against different uh positions on
 
02:37:15.510 --> 02:37:15.520 align:start position:0%
whether or not to repeal prohibition it
 
02:37:15.520 --> 02:37:16.630 align:start position:0%
whether or not to repeal prohibition it
passed

02:37:16.630 --> 02:37:16.640 align:start position:0%
passed
 
02:37:19.030 --> 02:37:19.040 align:start position:0%
ra rather easily um and the process
 
02:37:20.790 --> 02:37:20.800 align:start position:0%
worked very well uh and that was a
 
02:37:22.030 --> 02:37:22.040 align:start position:0%
process that people were scared of at
 
02:37:24.389 --> 02:37:24.399 align:start position:0%
the time because we hadn't seen uh the
 
02:37:26.830 --> 02:37:26.840 align:start position:0%
Article 5 convention process used for
 
02:37:29.950 --> 02:37:29.960 align:start position:0%
either ratifications or for proposal we
 
02:37:32.070 --> 02:37:32.080 align:start position:0%
used it for ratifications we know how
 
02:37:34.110 --> 02:37:34.120 align:start position:0%
that worked it worked very well and we
 
02:37:36.469 --> 02:37:36.479 align:start position:0%
can do the same for proposals right now
 
02:37:38.389 --> 02:37:38.399 align:start position:0%
uh and I'm happy to take any and all
 
02:37:40.630 --> 02:37:40.640 align:start position:0%
questions uh as I said I've I've spent a
 
02:37:43.550 --> 02:37:43.560 align:start position:0%
long time researching
 
02:37:47.349 --> 02:37:47.359 align:start position:0%
this thanks representative
 
02:37:51.469 --> 02:37:51.479 align:start position:0%
gagy thank you Mr chairman
 
02:37:54.910 --> 02:37:54.920 align:start position:0%
um I've heard your explanation and I've
 
02:37:57.870 --> 02:37:57.880 align:start position:0%
heard from the opposition that seem some
 
02:38:01.070 --> 02:38:01.080 align:start position:0%
of the who are opposed to hcr8 that
 
02:38:05.550 --> 02:38:05.560 align:start position:0%
state now they use the phrase runaway
 
02:38:09.349 --> 02:38:09.359 align:start position:0%
convention could you explain to me why
 
02:38:12.230 --> 02:38:12.240 align:start position:0%
they might feel that way sure and
 
02:38:15.590 --> 02:38:15.600 align:start position:0%
whether they're safeguards sure um the
 
02:38:18.830 --> 02:38:18.840 align:start position:0%
uh a lot of it is based on the the
 
02:38:21.510 --> 02:38:21.520 align:start position:0%
notion the the false notion that the
 
02:38:23.710 --> 02:38:23.720 align:start position:0%
best precedent for this is the
 
02:38:26.429 --> 02:38:26.439 align:start position:0%
1787 uh convention and it's also based
 
02:38:28.349 --> 02:38:28.359 align:start position:0%
on some misconceptions about that that
 
02:38:31.910 --> 02:38:31.920 align:start position:0%
Convention as well um first I want to
 
02:38:34.469 --> 02:38:34.479 align:start position:0%
point out that um there are a great
 
02:38:36.469 --> 02:38:36.479 align:start position:0%
number of different types of conventions
 
02:38:39.469 --> 02:38:39.479 align:start position:0%
that we have precedent for uh the Trea
 
02:38:42.110 --> 02:38:42.120 align:start position:0%
by Jameson in the mid 19th century and
 
02:38:45.269 --> 02:38:45.279 align:start position:0%
then by in 1910 as a as a followup
 
02:38:46.309 --> 02:38:46.319 align:start position:0%
to that
 
02:38:47.910 --> 02:38:47.920 align:start position:0%
uh were the first really detailed
 
02:38:50.349 --> 02:38:50.359 align:start position:0%
scholarly studies of different types of
 
02:38:52.750 --> 02:38:52.760 align:start position:0%
convention processes and they compared
 
02:38:54.710 --> 02:38:54.720 align:start position:0%
and contrasted different kinds of
 
02:38:58.150 --> 02:38:58.160 align:start position:0%
conventions and we can see um based on
 
02:39:00.110 --> 02:39:00.120 align:start position:0%
the way they laid out their
 
02:39:02.190 --> 02:39:02.200 align:start position:0%
categorizations where where certain ones
 
02:39:04.230 --> 02:39:04.240 align:start position:0%
have similarities and differences to the
 
02:39:06.710 --> 02:39:06.720 align:start position:0%
Article 5 proposing convention and use
 
02:39:09.389 --> 02:39:09.399 align:start position:0%
the precedent from each of those uh and
 
02:39:11.309 --> 02:39:11.319 align:start position:0%
I gave a a talk specifically just about
 
02:39:13.070 --> 02:39:13.080 align:start position:0%
that issue a couple years ago in
 
02:39:16.870 --> 02:39:16.880 align:start position:0%
Colorado um the where we can use the
 
02:39:18.469 --> 02:39:18.479 align:start position:0%
Precedence from each of those and
 
02:39:20.389 --> 02:39:20.399 align:start position:0%
compare to establish what the
 
02:39:22.389 --> 02:39:22.399 align:start position:0%
precedences are for control of the
 
02:39:25.469 --> 02:39:25.479 align:start position:0%
article 5 uh proposing convention but
 
02:39:29.230 --> 02:39:29.240 align:start position:0%
specifically the 1787 Convention um the
 
02:39:31.230 --> 02:39:31.240 align:start position:0%
notion has been put forth that because
 
02:39:33.790 --> 02:39:33.800 align:start position:0%
the Articles of Confederation required
 
02:39:36.349 --> 02:39:36.359 align:start position:0%
unanimity to make a change that that
 
02:39:40.190 --> 02:39:40.200 align:start position:0%
meant that the 1787 Convention um was a
 
02:39:41.950 --> 02:39:41.960 align:start position:0%
runaway that it didn't do what its
 
02:39:45.309 --> 02:39:45.319 align:start position:0%
mandate was in fact the 1787 Convention
 
02:39:47.630 --> 02:39:47.640 align:start position:0%
uh was was proposed originally by the
 
02:39:50.590 --> 02:39:50.600 align:start position:0%
Annapolis convention report um that
 
02:39:53.429 --> 02:39:53.439 align:start position:0%
report was written by Alexander Hamilton
 
02:39:56.510 --> 02:39:56.520 align:start position:0%
um because the Annapolis convention uh
 
02:39:58.309 --> 02:39:58.319 align:start position:0%
was called for The Limited purpose of
 
02:40:00.830 --> 02:40:00.840 align:start position:0%
dealing with economic issues um but at
 
02:40:02.910 --> 02:40:02.920 align:start position:0%
the time there was the uh Shae Rebellion
 
02:40:05.190 --> 02:40:05.200 align:start position:0%
going on and that scared everybody so
 
02:40:07.670 --> 02:40:07.680 align:start position:0%
New Jersey asent their delegate with
 
02:40:10.910 --> 02:40:10.920 align:start position:0%
much broader authority to um to address
 
02:40:13.710 --> 02:40:13.720 align:start position:0%
the exigencies of the Union um but they
 
02:40:15.110 --> 02:40:15.120 align:start position:0%
were the only delegate that did that
 
02:40:16.590 --> 02:40:16.600 align:start position:0%
they were the only state that authorized
 
02:40:18.429 --> 02:40:18.439 align:start position:0%
that the convention was not authorized
 
02:40:20.309 --> 02:40:20.319 align:start position:0%
for that as a whole and no state had
 
02:40:22.230 --> 02:40:22.240 align:start position:0%
authorized their delegates to to address
 
02:40:24.630 --> 02:40:24.640 align:start position:0%
those issues so the instead Hamilton
 
02:40:26.389 --> 02:40:26.399 align:start position:0%
took that language exigencies of the
 
02:40:28.190 --> 02:40:28.200 align:start position:0%
Union put it in the report for the
 
02:40:30.510 --> 02:40:30.520 align:start position:0%
Annapolis convention that same language
 
02:40:32.950 --> 02:40:32.960 align:start position:0%
then ended up in the call from Congress
 
02:40:35.190 --> 02:40:35.200 align:start position:0%
that uh that they used to suggest that
 
02:40:38.590 --> 02:40:38.600 align:start position:0%
the states meet in convention um but
 
02:40:40.429 --> 02:40:40.439 align:start position:0%
Congress was also particularly concerned
 
02:40:43.230 --> 02:40:43.240 align:start position:0%
that this was not a convention under the
 
02:40:45.110 --> 02:40:45.120 align:start position:0%
Articles of Confederation the articles
 
02:40:47.150 --> 02:40:47.160 align:start position:0%
of confeder Federation had no convention
 
02:40:49.269 --> 02:40:49.279 align:start position:0%
procedure this was an informal
 
02:40:51.630 --> 02:40:51.640 align:start position:0%
convention called by the states that
 
02:40:54.070 --> 02:40:54.080 align:start position:0%
Congress was simply suggesting that the
 
02:40:57.469 --> 02:40:57.479 align:start position:0%
states uh attend through their language
 
02:40:58.950 --> 02:40:58.960 align:start position:0%
and they were very concerned not to
 
02:41:00.590 --> 02:41:00.600 align:start position:0%
appear that they were taking over the
 
02:41:04.830 --> 02:41:04.840 align:start position:0%
process um the the states met uh all all
 
02:41:07.710 --> 02:41:07.720 align:start position:0%
of them except for possibly New York had
 
02:41:10.150 --> 02:41:10.160 align:start position:0%
that exigencies of the Union language uh
 
02:41:11.630 --> 02:41:11.640 align:start position:0%
New York two of the three delegates
 
02:41:13.710 --> 02:41:13.720 align:start position:0%
ended up leaving and the state did not
 
02:41:16.110 --> 02:41:16.120 align:start position:0%
vote upon after that because they didn't
 
02:41:18.870 --> 02:41:18.880 align:start position:0%
feel that it was within their purview um
 
02:41:20.630 --> 02:41:20.640 align:start position:0%
okay okay I don't I don't I don't need
 
02:41:22.710 --> 02:41:22.720 align:start position:0%
the whole history Sor about that follow
 
02:41:24.990 --> 02:41:25.000 align:start position:0%
up M Mr chairman I just want to know
 
02:41:26.950 --> 02:41:26.960 align:start position:0%
what are the safeguards that would be in
 
02:41:31.750 --> 02:41:31.760 align:start position:0%
place today sure um so there are uh the
 
02:41:34.790 --> 02:41:34.800 align:start position:0%
process is divided into what I refer to
 
02:41:36.750 --> 02:41:36.760 align:start position:0%
as the safety net there are roles for
 
02:41:40.030 --> 02:41:40.040 align:start position:0%
the courts to play in uh in ensuring uh
 
02:41:42.030 --> 02:41:42.040 align:start position:0%
delegate limitation bills that different
 
02:41:44.750 --> 02:41:44.760 align:start position:0%
states have those bills add to the
 
02:41:46.550 --> 02:41:46.560 align:start position:0%
safety they are not required a lot of
 
02:41:49.550 --> 02:41:49.560 align:start position:0%
this is baked in without them uh courts
 
02:41:52.990 --> 02:41:53.000 align:start position:0%
also enforce um ratification procedures
 
02:41:55.670 --> 02:41:55.680 align:start position:0%
we've seen precedent of Courts ruling on
 
02:41:58.349 --> 02:41:58.359 align:start position:0%
Article 5 issues and we've also seen an
 
02:42:00.510 --> 02:42:00.520 align:start position:0%
analogous uh State Court decision in
 
02:42:02.950 --> 02:42:02.960 align:start position:0%
Florida on a very similar set of facts
 
02:42:04.309 --> 02:42:04.319 align:start position:0%
where they did not allow something to go
 
02:42:05.670 --> 02:42:05.680 align:start position:0%
on for ratification because it was
 
02:42:08.630 --> 02:42:08.640 align:start position:0%
outside of the scope we've also seen um
 
02:42:10.710 --> 02:42:10.720 align:start position:0%
Congress has an extensive role to play
 
02:42:12.349 --> 02:42:12.359 align:start position:0%
Congress can only send things on for
 
02:42:14.429 --> 02:42:14.439 align:start position:0%
ratification that have been properly
 
02:42:16.670 --> 02:42:16.680 align:start position:0%
proposed that true whether it's proposed
 
02:42:18.190 --> 02:42:18.200 align:start position:0%
by Congress they couldn't send something
 
02:42:19.990 --> 02:42:20.000 align:start position:0%
on that was proposed by a simple
 
02:42:21.790 --> 02:42:21.800 align:start position:0%
majority it would have to be proposed by
 
02:42:23.870 --> 02:42:23.880 align:start position:0%
two-thirds of each house the same is
 
02:42:25.750 --> 02:42:25.760 align:start position:0%
true for an article 5 convention they
 
02:42:27.550 --> 02:42:27.560 align:start position:0%
could only send something on that's been
 
02:42:29.830 --> 02:42:29.840 align:start position:0%
properly proposed by a convention and at
 
02:42:31.389 --> 02:42:31.399 align:start position:0%
the state level whether it's through the
 
02:42:32.990 --> 02:42:33.000 align:start position:0%
state legislatures or through State
 
02:42:34.910 --> 02:42:34.920 align:start position:0%
conventions we've seen both processes
 
02:42:36.790 --> 02:42:36.800 align:start position:0%
work extremely well to reflect the will
 
02:42:38.990 --> 02:42:39.000 align:start position:0%
of the people um and then the delegate
 
02:42:40.750 --> 02:42:40.760 align:start position:0%
selection itself the delegates are sent
 
02:42:44.070 --> 02:42:44.080 align:start position:0%
there for the uh for a specific limited
 
02:42:46.230 --> 02:42:46.240 align:start position:0%
purpose not with wedge ISS issues or all
 
02:42:48.150 --> 02:42:48.160 align:start position:0%
kinds of other issues and when we see
 
02:42:50.070 --> 02:42:50.080 align:start position:0%
people sent to someplace for a specific
 
02:42:52.349 --> 02:42:52.359 align:start position:0%
purpose we tend to get people who are
 
02:42:54.269 --> 02:42:54.279 align:start position:0%
serious about that issue and making sure
 
02:42:56.230 --> 02:42:56.240 align:start position:0%
that it's handled properly and those
 
02:42:59.030 --> 02:42:59.040 align:start position:0%
four separate is um parties I don't
 
02:43:01.349 --> 02:43:01.359 align:start position:0%
trust any one of them on their own but I
 
02:43:02.870 --> 02:43:02.880 align:start position:0%
trust the network built into the
 
02:43:05.030 --> 02:43:05.040 align:start position:0%
framework of our constitution for all of
 
02:43:07.110 --> 02:43:07.120 align:start position:0%
them working
 
02:43:10.150 --> 02:43:10.160 align:start position:0%
together thank you uh any other pressing
 
02:43:13.550 --> 02:43:13.560 align:start position:0%
questions uh representative
 
02:43:16.030 --> 02:43:16.040 align:start position:0%
filio it was addressed somewhat in the
 
02:43:17.990 --> 02:43:18.000 align:start position:0%
previous answer but I am concerned about
 
02:43:20.830 --> 02:43:20.840 align:start position:0%
the justic ability of the article 5
 
02:43:22.030 --> 02:43:22.040 align:start position:0%
issues and particularly whether the
 
02:43:23.550 --> 02:43:23.560 align:start position:0%
courts are going to view this as a
 
02:43:25.550 --> 02:43:25.560 align:start position:0%
political question while there's been
 
02:43:27.710 --> 02:43:27.720 align:start position:0%
analogies drawn to the faith of selector
 
02:43:30.349 --> 02:43:30.359 align:start position:0%
question which is certainly a justable
 
02:43:33.150 --> 02:43:33.160 align:start position:0%
issue because it concerns election law
 
02:43:34.550 --> 02:43:34.560 align:start position:0%
my concern is that if we were to give
 
02:43:36.190 --> 02:43:36.200 align:start position:0%
for example limiting instructions the
 
02:43:37.830 --> 02:43:37.840 align:start position:0%
court may actually throw their hands up
 
02:43:40.469 --> 02:43:40.479 align:start position:0%
in the air because it's a political
 
02:43:42.429 --> 02:43:42.439 align:start position:0%
question that is specifically delegated
 
02:43:44.870 --> 02:43:44.880 align:start position:0%
to the political branches do you have
 
02:43:46.870 --> 02:43:46.880 align:start position:0%
any case law or any opinion on to
 
02:43:48.070 --> 02:43:48.080 align:start position:0%
whether or not this would actually be
 
02:43:51.710 --> 02:43:51.720 align:start position:0%
justiciable if it came to that yes so um
 
02:43:53.630 --> 02:43:53.640 align:start position:0%
and I believe hawy Smith which is
 
02:43:55.670 --> 02:43:55.680 align:start position:0%
referenced in the material sent out by
 
02:43:59.750 --> 02:43:59.760 align:start position:0%
the um uh by your uh researcher uh it it
 
02:44:02.590 --> 02:44:02.600 align:start position:0%
references that um that certain things
 
02:44:04.990 --> 02:44:05.000 align:start position:0%
that are especially things in Article 5
 
02:44:07.230 --> 02:44:07.240 align:start position:0%
that may be assigned to a legislature
 
02:44:08.990 --> 02:44:09.000 align:start position:0%
are not inherently
 
02:44:10.990 --> 02:44:11.000 align:start position:0%
legislative uh that that is the case
 
02:44:13.230 --> 02:44:13.240 align:start position:0%
here as well uh you can see in Article 5
 
02:44:15.389 --> 02:44:15.399 align:start position:0%
of The Constitution uses the word
 
02:44:17.630 --> 02:44:17.640 align:start position:0%
Congress must do this or that it is not
 
02:44:19.269 --> 02:44:19.279 align:start position:0%
discretionary it is not their normal
 
02:44:22.230 --> 02:44:22.240 align:start position:0%
legislative activity Article 5 is also
 
02:44:24.230 --> 02:44:24.240 align:start position:0%
not article one um where their
 
02:44:28.030 --> 02:44:28.040 align:start position:0%
legislative activity comes from um and
 
02:44:30.349 --> 02:44:30.359 align:start position:0%
uh because of that I'm I'm very
 
02:44:32.429 --> 02:44:32.439 align:start position:0%
confident that courts would see fit to
 
02:44:34.429 --> 02:44:34.439 align:start position:0%
step in and they have stepped in before
 
02:44:36.990 --> 02:44:37.000 align:start position:0%
and dealt with Article 5 related issues
 
02:44:39.070 --> 02:44:39.080 align:start position:0%
uh not just limited to the list that's
 
02:44:41.550 --> 02:44:41.560 align:start position:0%
um that's on the back of that case uh
 
02:44:45.110 --> 02:44:45.120 align:start position:0%
but including that list um and uh we
 
02:44:46.469 --> 02:44:46.479 align:start position:0%
we've seen that numerous times as well
 
02:44:48.190 --> 02:44:48.200 align:start position:0%
as that Florida case that is on an
 
02:44:50.030 --> 02:44:50.040 align:start position:0%
analogous set of issues where the court
 
02:44:53.389 --> 02:44:53.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:58.389 --> 02:44:58.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:01.710 --> 02:45:01.720 align:start position:0%
Sam S no Hans thank you uh so much for
 
02:45:03.230 --> 02:45:03.240 align:start position:0%
coming back thank you and with your
 
02:45:06.990 --> 02:45:07.000 align:start position:0%
comprehensive answers at this
 
02:45:09.830 --> 02:45:09.840 align:start position:0%
time uh we'll call a termination to this
 
02:45:11.469 --> 02:45:11.479 align:start position:0%
sharing we have one more measure this
 
02:45:15.590 --> 02:45:15.600 align:start position:0%
morning uh and this measure hcr9 is uh
 
02:45:18.230 --> 02:45:18.240 align:start position:0%
very much kind of the flip side of hcr8
 
02:45:22.990 --> 02:45:23.000 align:start position:0%
hcr8 was uh uh in favor uh supportive of
 
02:45:26.590 --> 02:45:26.600 align:start position:0%
an article 5 situation uh hcr9 is is the
 
02:45:27.870 --> 02:45:27.880 align:start position:0%
flip side of
 
02:45:31.590 --> 02:45:31.600 align:start position:0%
that excuse me so I'm looking at the uh
 
02:45:33.269 --> 02:45:33.279 align:start position:0%
prospective speakers and it's a lot of
 
02:45:35.910 --> 02:45:35.920 align:start position:0%
the same folks who spoke the last time
 
02:45:39.349 --> 02:45:39.359 align:start position:0%
now I'm going to ask uh uh the the prime
 
02:45:41.590 --> 02:45:41.600 align:start position:0%
sponsor has all the time that she needs
 
02:45:45.550 --> 02:45:45.560 align:start position:0%
to completely uh present the bill um the
 
02:45:48.150 --> 02:45:48.160 align:start position:0%
folks who want to speak to it what the I
 
02:45:50.190 --> 02:45:50.200 align:start position:0%
think I can speak for the committee uh
 
02:45:53.309 --> 02:45:53.319 align:start position:0%
we do not need to hear you say the same
 
02:45:56.349 --> 02:45:56.359 align:start position:0%
thing for or against uh Article 5
 
02:45:58.910 --> 02:45:58.920 align:start position:0%
convention that we just heard uh over
 
02:46:01.389 --> 02:46:01.399 align:start position:0%
the last couple of hours and so I'm
 
02:46:04.630 --> 02:46:04.640 align:start position:0%
going to ask that you if you uh are just
 
02:46:06.710 --> 02:46:06.720 align:start position:0%
going to repeat what you said before
 
02:46:09.590 --> 02:46:09.600 align:start position:0%
only flipping it uh we already have that
 
02:46:13.150 --> 02:46:13.160 align:start position:0%
and we get that so uh once we get to the
 
02:46:14.750 --> 02:46:14.760 align:start position:0%
pink cards I'm going to ask you to keep
 
02:46:16.990 --> 02:46:17.000 align:start position:0%
it to a minute or two and and and you're
 
02:46:18.830 --> 02:46:18.840 align:start position:0%
welcome also to wave I also want to
 
02:46:20.990 --> 02:46:21.000 align:start position:0%
respect anybody who who has not yet
 
02:46:24.389 --> 02:46:24.399 align:start position:0%
spoken uh who's traveled here uh we want
 
02:46:26.030 --> 02:46:26.040 align:start position:0%
to hear what you have to say and let it
 
02:46:28.910 --> 02:46:28.920 align:start position:0%
be recorded so all that said here's
 
02:46:32.510 --> 02:46:32.520 align:start position:0%
another pink card um let's get right to
 
02:46:34.469 --> 02:46:34.479 align:start position:0%
it representative maarda the prime
 
02:46:36.349 --> 02:46:36.359 align:start position:0%
sponsor you have as much time as you
 
02:46:39.230 --> 02:46:39.240 align:start position:0%
would like and uh and again as I said I
 
02:46:42.030 --> 02:46:42.040 align:start position:0%
hope that the uh the following speakers
 
02:46:45.030 --> 02:46:45.040 align:start position:0%
will keep it to a minute uh or two uh
 
02:46:47.830 --> 02:46:47.840 align:start position:0%
welcome R mcarter thank you Mr chair uh
 
02:46:50.190 --> 02:46:50.200 align:start position:0%
Nicki mcarter from Belmont representing
 
02:46:54.510 --> 02:46:54.520 align:start position:0%
belnap uh County District 8 um a lot of
 
02:46:56.309 --> 02:46:56.319 align:start position:0%
uh the materials obviously have already
 
02:46:58.309 --> 02:46:58.319 align:start position:0%
been covered as you indicated so I'm not
 
02:47:00.870 --> 02:47:00.880 align:start position:0%
going to belabor the issue um I
 
02:47:06.469 --> 02:47:06.479 align:start position:0%
submitted um the draft for hcr9 at the
 
02:47:09.150 --> 02:47:09.160 align:start position:0%
um urging of several constituents one of
 
02:47:11.590 --> 02:47:11.600 align:start position:0%
them is in this room uh to speak to this
 
02:47:14.469 --> 02:47:14.479 align:start position:0%
today and um it was proposed to me in
 
02:47:18.590 --> 02:47:18.600 align:start position:0%
such a fashion that I couldn't um I
 
02:47:20.469 --> 02:47:20.479 align:start position:0%
couldn't say that it wasn't a good idea
 
02:47:23.510 --> 02:47:23.520 align:start position:0%
to submit this legislation
 
02:47:26.349 --> 02:47:26.359 align:start position:0%
um I don't know about any of you with
 
02:47:28.990 --> 02:47:29.000 align:start position:0%
regards to what the federal government
 
02:47:31.469 --> 02:47:31.479 align:start position:0%
is doing now has been doing historically
 
02:47:34.590 --> 02:47:34.600 align:start position:0%
over several decades but I don't trust
 
02:47:36.830 --> 02:47:36.840 align:start position:0%
them I don't trust that they have any of
 
02:47:40.070 --> 02:47:40.080 align:start position:0%
our uh interests in uh our best
 
02:47:42.070 --> 02:47:42.080 align:start position:0%
interests at heart when they make the
 
02:47:45.910 --> 02:47:45.920 align:start position:0%
decisions um at the federal level so I
 
02:47:48.750 --> 02:47:48.760 align:start position:0%
can um agree with several of the
 
02:47:51.150 --> 02:47:51.160 align:start position:0%
previous speakers that I think what we
 
02:47:53.230 --> 02:47:53.240 align:start position:0%
need to do is start here at home to make
 
02:47:57.590 --> 02:47:57.600 align:start position:0%
some changes um let go of the federal uh
 
02:48:00.110 --> 02:48:00.120 align:start position:0%
wallet that they keep handing to us to
 
02:48:02.510 --> 02:48:02.520 align:start position:0%
grab I I just think that we need to
 
02:48:05.790 --> 02:48:05.800 align:start position:0%
start here at home and opening up the
 
02:48:08.710 --> 02:48:08.720 align:start position:0%
most uh beautiful historical document
 
02:48:12.429 --> 02:48:12.439 align:start position:0%
that uh our country exists on today is
 
02:48:15.389 --> 02:48:15.399 align:start position:0%
probably a very dangerous thing in this
 
02:48:17.990 --> 02:48:18.000 align:start position:0%
political climate perhaps another time
 
02:48:20.429 --> 02:48:20.439 align:start position:0%
in history it may have been uh a
 
02:48:22.150 --> 02:48:22.160 align:start position:0%
workable thing where we can all trust
 
02:48:23.590 --> 02:48:23.600 align:start position:0%
each other and Trust who's there and
 
02:48:24.830 --> 02:48:24.840 align:start position:0%
Trust what they're going to do and the
 
02:48:27.429 --> 02:48:27.439 align:start position:0%
issues are only going to be uh uh
 
02:48:29.950 --> 02:48:29.960 align:start position:0%
specific to you know what this what what
 
02:48:31.630 --> 02:48:31.640 align:start position:0%
this is going to resend the balance
 
02:48:37.269 --> 02:48:37.279 align:start position:0%
budget um article and application but
 
02:48:39.510 --> 02:48:39.520 align:start position:0%
right now there is a house concurrent
 
02:48:41.710 --> 02:48:41.720 align:start position:0%
resolution in the US House of
 
02:48:44.230 --> 02:48:44.240 align:start position:0%
Representatives that um is looking to
 
02:48:46.510 --> 02:48:46.520 align:start position:0%
aggregate all of the open applications
 
02:48:50.630 --> 02:48:50.640 align:start position:0%
together into one um one pile so that
 
02:48:54.110 --> 02:48:54.120 align:start position:0%
they can get to the 34 states that they
 
02:48:59.030 --> 02:48:59.040 align:start position:0%
need and that tells me this convention
 
02:49:01.870 --> 02:49:01.880 align:start position:0%
will not be issue specific for each
 
02:49:03.750 --> 02:49:03.760 align:start position:0%
application it tells me that they're
 
02:49:07.190 --> 02:49:07.200 align:start position:0%
going to lump it all together and uh go
 
02:49:11.150 --> 02:49:11.160 align:start position:0%
on a distruction spree I just I fear
 
02:49:12.550 --> 02:49:12.560 align:start position:0%
that and I think it's pretty
 
02:49:15.349 --> 02:49:15.359 align:start position:0%
well-founded uh fear at this point
 
02:49:19.269 --> 02:49:19.279 align:start position:0%
I would uh just urge you to uh ought to
 
02:49:23.790 --> 02:49:23.800 align:start position:0%
pass or vote a to pass um for hcr9 I
 
02:49:25.670 --> 02:49:25.680 align:start position:0%
have some plenty of people here in the
 
02:49:27.990 --> 02:49:28.000 align:start position:0%
room that I'm sure can back me up on
 
02:49:30.750 --> 02:49:30.760 align:start position:0%
this or speak against I guess so thanks
 
02:49:32.389 --> 02:49:32.399 align:start position:0%
for your time
 
02:49:34.790 --> 02:49:34.800 align:start position:0%
today thank you refer mcarter uh

asked for five minutes I'm going to give
 
02:50:00.790 --> 02:50:00.800 align:start position:0%
you one to two to be I have to be
 
02:50:03.870 --> 02:50:03.880 align:start position:0%
consistent I I understand so uh I'm just
 
02:50:05.630 --> 02:50:05.640 align:start position:0%
going to go through a a list in that
 
02:50:09.110 --> 02:50:09.120 align:start position:0%
case uh thank you for having me on here
 
02:50:11.269 --> 02:50:11.279 align:start position:0%
uh I would like to reiterate that uh any
 
02:50:13.469 --> 02:50:13.479 align:start position:0%
research that you can do on an article 5
 
02:50:16.269 --> 02:50:16.279 align:start position:0%
convention is a research into conjecture
 
02:50:19.630 --> 02:50:19.640 align:start position:0%
there is no existing case of an article
 
02:50:21.950 --> 02:50:21.960 align:start position:0%
5 convention being used therefore any
 
02:50:24.830 --> 02:50:24.840 align:start position:0%
claims that you can be an expert in it
 
02:50:26.389 --> 02:50:26.399 align:start position:0%
or that you've done a lot of research or
 
02:50:27.950 --> 02:50:27.960 align:start position:0%
anything like that it it doesn't matter
 
02:50:29.269 --> 02:50:29.279 align:start position:0%
because you're talking about something
 
02:50:30.990 --> 02:50:31.000 align:start position:0%
that's never happened before it's all
 
02:50:32.190 --> 02:50:32.200 align:start position:0%
just mere
 
02:50:35.150 --> 02:50:35.160 align:start position:0%
hypothesis uh one of the previous
 
02:50:36.309 --> 02:50:36.319 align:start position:0%
speakers mentioned that they supported
 
02:50:37.750 --> 02:50:37.760 align:start position:0%
Article 5 conventions in Maine on
 
02:50:39.910 --> 02:50:39.920 align:start position:0%
multiple topics isn't that a little
 
02:50:42.150 --> 02:50:42.160 align:start position:0%
interesting it's almost as though
 
02:50:44.830 --> 02:50:44.840 align:start position:0%
perhaps uh there is an interest in many
 
02:50:46.870 --> 02:50:46.880 align:start position:0%
people's minds to support Article 5
 
02:50:50.309 --> 02:50:50.319 align:start position:0%
conventions generally not for the exact
 
02:50:51.630 --> 02:50:51.640 align:start position:0%
claims that they're pushing this
 
02:50:55.070 --> 02:50:55.080 align:start position:0%
specific one on all right um the
 
02:50:56.590 --> 02:50:56.600 align:start position:0%
Constitutional Convention that brought
 
02:50:58.030 --> 02:50:58.040 align:start position:0%
about our current
 
02:51:01.030 --> 02:51:01.040 align:start position:0%
constitution was intended to only
 
02:51:02.670 --> 02:51:02.680 align:start position:0%
provide amendments to the Articles of
 
02:51:04.389 --> 02:51:04.399 align:start position:0%
Confederation that's why all the states
 
02:51:05.790 --> 02:51:05.800 align:start position:0%
were on board with that except Rhode
 
02:51:07.110 --> 02:51:07.120 align:start position:0%
Island Rhode Island had nothing to do
 
02:51:08.870 --> 02:51:08.880 align:start position:0%
with it they were they didn't want
 
02:51:11.070 --> 02:51:11.080 align:start position:0%
anything to do with that um they walked
 
02:51:12.870 --> 02:51:12.880 align:start position:0%
out with a whole new constitution uh
 
02:51:14.309 --> 02:51:14.319 align:start position:0%
this is I don't want to belabor that
 
02:51:16.429 --> 02:51:16.439 align:start position:0%
point but I did want to bring that
 
02:51:20.190 --> 02:51:20.200 align:start position:0%
up so here's a question do current are
 
02:51:22.110 --> 02:51:22.120 align:start position:0%
the politicians and the Statesmen and
 
02:51:24.990 --> 02:51:25.000 align:start position:0%
the people we have now morally
 
02:51:27.349 --> 02:51:27.359 align:start position:0%
equivalent of the people that existed
 
02:51:29.429 --> 02:51:29.439 align:start position:0%
back then are we of the same character
 
02:51:31.349 --> 02:51:31.359 align:start position:0%
as the people in this late 1700s who
 
02:51:33.510 --> 02:51:33.520 align:start position:0%
fought a revolution against the British
 
02:51:36.070 --> 02:51:36.080 align:start position:0%
I don't think we are um I like myself
 
02:51:37.429 --> 02:51:37.439 align:start position:0%
and I like most of the people on this
 
02:51:40.349 --> 02:51:40.359 align:start position:0%
committee but we are not those people we
 
02:51:42.429 --> 02:51:42.439 align:start position:0%
are good people we're not nearly as good
 
02:51:44.190 --> 02:51:44.200 align:start position:0%
as they were and any Constitutional
 
02:51:46.030 --> 02:51:46.040 align:start position:0%
Convention that takes place will not
 
02:51:47.870 --> 02:51:47.880 align:start position:0%
result in a constitution that's nearly
 
02:51:50.229 --> 02:51:50.239 align:start position:0%
as good as the one we got by mere fluke
 
02:51:51.990 --> 02:51:52.000 align:start position:0%
the fact that our constitution is this
 
02:51:55.750 --> 02:51:55.760 align:start position:0%
good is a weird it's a bizarre nature of
 
02:51:57.469 --> 02:51:57.479 align:start position:0%
reality thing there's no there's
 
02:51:59.389 --> 02:51:59.399 align:start position:0%
basically no chance of a constitution
 
02:52:00.830 --> 02:52:00.840 align:start position:0%
ever coming out of anybody that's as
 
02:52:02.590 --> 02:52:02.600 align:start position:0%
good as the one we have we should be
 
02:52:04.150 --> 02:52:04.160 align:start position:0%
thanking our lucky stars that we have
 
02:52:06.269 --> 02:52:06.279 align:start position:0%
one that's as good as it is and uh we
 
02:52:08.870 --> 02:52:08.880 align:start position:0%
should not try to change it at all if
 
02:52:10.830 --> 02:52:10.840 align:start position:0%
congression thank you representative I I
 
02:52:12.429 --> 02:52:12.439 align:start position:0%
have to be consistent here I'm going to
 
02:52:13.910 --> 02:52:13.920 align:start position:0%
be holding other people to one to two
 
02:52:17.630 --> 02:52:17.640 align:start position:0%
minutes um and so I have to be uh that
 
02:52:21.510 --> 02:52:21.520 align:start position:0%
way W with you uh uh thank you I won't
 
02:52:22.510 --> 02:52:22.520 align:start position:0%
be able to stay for the rest of the
 
02:52:25.950 --> 02:52:25.960 align:start position:0%
testimony though okay uh we'll carry on
 
02:52:34.990 --> 02:52:35.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:38.830 --> 02:52:38.840 align:start position:0%
here right Matthew uh please take a
 
02:52:40.950 --> 02:52:40.960 align:start position:0%
minute or two to uh hopefully give us
 
02:52:44.269 --> 02:52:44.279 align:start position:0%
something um something new something new
 
02:52:46.030 --> 02:52:46.040 align:start position:0%
oh okay well I'll do that for you my
 
02:52:47.950 --> 02:52:47.960 align:start position:0%
name is Matthew rhods and if I didn't
 
02:52:49.710 --> 02:52:49.720 align:start position:0%
mention this before I am a proud member
 
02:52:51.830 --> 02:52:51.840 align:start position:0%
of the John Birch Society the reason I
 
02:52:54.750 --> 02:52:54.760 align:start position:0%
didn't mention it is because I'm not a
 
02:52:56.190 --> 02:52:56.200 align:start position:0%
uh what do they call them lobbyist you
 
02:52:57.790 --> 02:52:57.800 align:start position:0%
know like that make six figures a year
 
02:52:59.190 --> 02:52:59.200 align:start position:0%
that come in to speak for special
 
02:53:00.630 --> 02:53:00.640 align:start position:0%
interest groups I come as a private
 
02:53:02.630 --> 02:53:02.640 align:start position:0%
citizen so I want to make sure that
 
02:53:04.309 --> 02:53:04.319 align:start position:0%
because uh you guys are aware of that
 
02:53:06.670 --> 02:53:06.680 align:start position:0%
there was no deception intended because
 
02:53:08.870 --> 02:53:08.880 align:start position:0%
we have Ken Quinn with the uh term
 
02:53:12.590 --> 02:53:12.600 align:start position:0%
limits USA doxing me on social media by
 
02:53:14.710 --> 02:53:14.720 align:start position:0%
showing my picture that I'm JBS to the
 
02:53:17.990 --> 02:53:18.000 align:start position:0%
audience here so let me say one thing
 
02:53:19.590 --> 02:53:19.600 align:start position:0%
new for you
 
02:53:22.070 --> 02:53:22.080 align:start position:0%
guys you don't want to be in bed with
 
02:53:23.830 --> 02:53:23.840 align:start position:0%
these people they are
 
02:53:26.110 --> 02:53:26.120 align:start position:0%
immoral okay they are bullies they'll
 
02:53:29.110 --> 02:53:29.120 align:start position:0%
push you around and they will intimidate
 
02:53:30.750 --> 02:53:30.760 align:start position:0%
you and they will put their hands on you
 
02:53:32.750 --> 02:53:32.760 align:start position:0%
and if I had to get sworn testimony to
 
02:53:35.150 --> 02:53:35.160 align:start position:0%
that fact I could do it very easily how
 
02:53:38.389 --> 02:53:38.399 align:start position:0%
I've been shoved pushed and intimidated
 
02:53:40.830 --> 02:53:40.840 align:start position:0%
so I think that what I'm going to say
 
02:53:42.790 --> 02:53:42.800 align:start position:0%
you guys if you could we we're
 
02:53:44.590 --> 02:53:44.600 align:start position:0%
interested in you speaking to to the
 
02:53:49.110 --> 02:53:49.120 align:start position:0%
measure and not about the personal well
 
02:53:51.670 --> 02:53:51.680 align:start position:0%
character was brought up by Ken Quinn
 
02:53:53.750 --> 02:53:53.760 align:start position:0%
and that was that was intimated by him
 
02:53:55.429 --> 02:53:55.439 align:start position:0%
pointing out that I was a member of JBS
 
02:53:57.150 --> 02:53:57.160 align:start position:0%
so I figured that was an it was open uh
 
02:53:59.950 --> 02:53:59.960 align:start position:0%
for for that so what I would say is that
 
02:54:01.750 --> 02:54:01.760 align:start position:0%
I think we have to be very careful about
 
02:54:04.469 --> 02:54:04.479 align:start position:0%
who we do business with in politics and
 
02:54:06.150 --> 02:54:06.160 align:start position:0%
be very careful about their moral
 
02:54:08.830 --> 02:54:08.840 align:start position:0%
compass that they're pushing Us in uh
 
02:54:12.710 --> 02:54:12.720 align:start position:0%
hcr9 is a great way to restore the
 
02:54:15.990 --> 02:54:16.000 align:start position:0%
states to their sovereign powers and to
 
02:54:17.550 --> 02:54:17.560 align:start position:0%
begin pushing back on the federal
 
02:54:19.550 --> 02:54:19.560 align:start position:0%
government and I thank you very much for
 
02:54:22.309 --> 02:54:22.319 align:start position:0%
hearing me and thank you I have a
 
02:54:24.389 --> 02:54:24.399 align:start position:0%
message that represent of kale is here
 
02:54:27.990 --> 02:54:28.000 align:start position:0%
represent kale uh uh you did not speak
 
02:54:30.389 --> 02:54:30.399 align:start position:0%
to the last measure correct and again
 
02:54:33.030 --> 02:54:33.040 align:start position:0%
these are related measures so uh you're
 
02:54:36.910 --> 02:54:36.920 align:start position:0%
welcome to take a couple of minutes um
 
02:54:39.229 --> 02:54:39.239 align:start position:0%
and and speak uh I don't have I don't
 
02:54:42.910 --> 02:54:42.920 align:start position:0%
see a card for you I turned in a card
 
02:54:45.750 --> 02:54:45.760 align:start position:0%
okay so just uh if you could let if your
 
02:54:48.750 --> 02:54:48.760 align:start position:0%
position for or against and uh and we'll
 
02:54:50.670 --> 02:54:50.680 align:start position:0%
give you a couple minutes for sure thank
 
02:54:52.469 --> 02:54:52.479 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair thank you uh honorable
 
02:54:54.670 --> 02:54:54.680 align:start position:0%
committee members um I I'm opposed to
 
02:54:54.680 --> 02:54:55.429 align:start position:0%
committee members um I I'm opposed to
this

02:54:55.429 --> 02:54:55.439 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:54:59.030 --> 02:54:59.040 align:start position:0%
legislation um and and I won't go into
 
02:55:00.469 --> 02:55:00.479 align:start position:0%
everything that you've already heard
 
02:55:02.309 --> 02:55:02.319 align:start position:0%
over and over again in multiple hearings
 
02:55:04.830 --> 02:55:04.840 align:start position:0%
over multiple years I'm just going to
 
02:55:09.229 --> 02:55:09.239 align:start position:0%
bring up um this fact imagine just for a
 
02:55:12.830 --> 02:55:12.840 align:start position:0%
second that we had never ratified the
 
02:55:15.870 --> 02:55:15.880 align:start position:0%
19th Amendment to the US Constitution
 
02:55:18.070 --> 02:55:18.080 align:start position:0%
and we never gave women the right to
 
02:55:22.830 --> 02:55:22.840 align:start position:0%
vote what tool then could they be using
 
02:55:26.269 --> 02:55:26.279 align:start position:0%
now to get the right to vote an article
 
02:55:29.150 --> 02:55:29.160 align:start position:0%
5 convention would be a tool that they
 
02:55:32.429 --> 02:55:32.439 align:start position:0%
could use to get the right to vote I
 
02:55:35.469 --> 02:55:35.479 align:start position:0%
also believe that we can't just accept
 
02:55:38.389 --> 02:55:38.399 align:start position:0%
one piece of the Constitution and cut it
 
02:55:41.389 --> 02:55:41.399 align:start position:0%
apart we have to accept all pieces of
 
02:55:43.750 --> 02:55:43.760 align:start position:0%
the Constitution and I don't think we
 
02:55:45.429 --> 02:55:45.439 align:start position:0%
should silence the voice of the
 
02:55:48.910 --> 02:55:48.920 align:start position:0%
legislative body that voted to adopt
 
02:55:51.070 --> 02:55:51.080 align:start position:0%
this resolution in the past and I think
 
02:55:53.870 --> 02:55:53.880 align:start position:0%
we should leave it as it is and I'll
 
02:55:56.229 --> 02:55:56.239 align:start position:0%
take any questions thank you for that
 
02:55:59.510 --> 02:55:59.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:03.469 --> 02:56:03.479 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none uh thank you thank
 
02:56:05.070 --> 02:56:05.080 align:start position:0%
you very
 
02:56:08.590 --> 02:56:08.600 align:start position:0%
much okay Eric Benitas has spoken before
 
02:56:11.630 --> 02:56:11.640 align:start position:0%
uh in support of the previous measure uh
 
02:56:15.229 --> 02:56:15.239 align:start position:0%
opposed obviously to this measure uh
 
02:56:17.990 --> 02:56:18.000 align:start position:0%
Eric uh take a minute or two yeah I I'll
 
02:56:21.710 --> 02:56:21.720 align:start position:0%
be really quick um uh I Eric Ben is
 
02:56:23.830 --> 02:56:23.840 align:start position:0%
Guilford uh opposed to this uh
 
02:56:26.910 --> 02:56:26.920 align:start position:0%
resolution um I'm not opposed the the
 
02:56:30.190 --> 02:56:30.200 align:start position:0%
resolution itself um mentions a previous
 
02:56:31.870 --> 02:56:31.880 align:start position:0%
resolution that is trying to resend a
 
02:56:33.790 --> 02:56:33.800 align:start position:0%
specific one and I do not have a problem
 
02:56:35.790 --> 02:56:35.800 align:start position:0%
with that like if you have problem with
 
02:56:37.830 --> 02:56:37.840 align:start position:0%
the subject matter of a resolution for
 
02:56:40.110 --> 02:56:40.120 align:start position:0%
Article 5 that's totally fine like if if
 
02:56:41.830 --> 02:56:41.840 align:start position:0%
you don't agree with the amendment that
 
02:56:44.590 --> 02:56:44.600 align:start position:0%
it's proposing that's totally fine what
 
02:56:47.710 --> 02:56:47.720 align:start position:0%
we need to do is separate the Article 5
 
02:56:49.590 --> 02:56:49.600 align:start position:0%
process and the subject matter that is
 
02:56:51.590 --> 02:56:51.600 align:start position:0%
brought up on the Article 5 process is
 
02:56:53.950 --> 02:56:53.960 align:start position:0%
just a method if you don't like laws
 
02:56:55.510 --> 02:56:55.520 align:start position:0%
that are being passed in New Hampshire
 
02:56:57.190 --> 02:56:57.200 align:start position:0%
you don't go after the process of us
 
02:56:59.030 --> 02:56:59.040 align:start position:0%
passing laws you don't say we should not
 
02:57:01.389 --> 02:57:01.399 align:start position:0%
pass any laws because I don't agree with
 
02:57:04.349 --> 02:57:04.359 align:start position:0%
this law right it's it's a process
 
02:57:06.269 --> 02:57:06.279 align:start position:0%
that's in the Constitution given to us
 
02:57:08.990 --> 02:57:09.000 align:start position:0%
as a state as a right for us to be able
 
02:57:11.590 --> 02:57:11.600 align:start position:0%
to pass res uh amendments the same as
 
02:57:14.830 --> 02:57:14.840 align:start position:0%
Congress does so uh I think that we just
 
02:57:17.150 --> 02:57:17.160 align:start position:0%
need to separate these two methods and
 
02:57:18.590 --> 02:57:18.600 align:start position:0%
if you don't agree with the subject
 
02:57:20.510 --> 02:57:20.520 align:start position:0%
matter of something that's totally fine
 
02:57:22.790 --> 02:57:22.800 align:start position:0%
you can push to resend that subject
 
02:57:24.870 --> 02:57:24.880 align:start position:0%
matter but putting all this language in
 
02:57:27.070 --> 02:57:27.080 align:start position:0%
fearmongering against the Article 5
 
02:57:29.590 --> 02:57:29.600 align:start position:0%
process is what I disagree with because
 
02:57:31.150 --> 02:57:31.160 align:start position:0%
that is just a process in the
 
02:57:34.349 --> 02:57:34.359 align:start position:0%
Constitution that we are using utilizing
 
02:57:36.510 --> 02:57:36.520 align:start position:0%
to get our state's rights so that's all
 
02:57:38.070 --> 02:57:38.080 align:start position:0%
I have to
 
02:57:42.510 --> 02:57:42.520 align:start position:0%
say thank you for that pressing question
 
02:57:43.750 --> 02:57:43.760 align:start position:0%
we don't want to miss any pressing
 
02:57:45.910 --> 02:57:45.920 align:start position:0%
question questions all right thank you
 
02:57:49.070 --> 02:57:49.080 align:start position:0%
so much uh Hal schliff is still here is
 
02:57:51.269 --> 02:57:51.279 align:start position:0%
Hal yes Hal was spoken earlier he said
 
02:57:54.190 --> 02:57:54.200 align:start position:0%
he has uh written testimony and yes I'm
 
02:57:55.389 --> 02:57:55.399 align:start position:0%
going to do it a little quick I'm not
 
02:57:57.429 --> 02:57:57.439 align:start position:0%
going to address what I already did but
 
02:57:59.349 --> 02:57:59.359 align:start position:0%
this uh particular resolution will
 
02:58:02.349 --> 02:58:02.359 align:start position:0%
resend New Hampshire's only application
 
02:58:03.429 --> 02:58:03.439 align:start position:0%
because in
 
02:58:06.830 --> 02:58:06.840 align:start position:0%
2010 the uh you wisely rended all of
 
02:58:09.550 --> 02:58:09.560 align:start position:0%
them and in 2012 this was added it's
 
02:58:11.870 --> 02:58:11.880 align:start position:0%
calling for a balanced budget amendment
 
02:58:14.030 --> 02:58:14.040 align:start position:0%
and most people in this room like the
 
02:58:16.030 --> 02:58:16.040 align:start position:0%
that idea of a balanced budget me but
 
02:58:18.469 --> 02:58:18.479 align:start position:0%
you have to examine it I have a copy of
 
02:58:21.070 --> 02:58:21.080 align:start position:0%
the resolution and the resolution says
 
02:58:25.349 --> 02:58:25.359 align:start position:0%
that um the balanced budget with certain
 
02:58:28.030 --> 02:58:28.040 align:start position:0%
exceptions ah this the Escape Clause
 
02:58:29.349 --> 02:58:29.359 align:start position:0%
that they don't mention in the
 
02:58:32.269 --> 02:58:32.279 align:start position:0%
resolution well all of the proposed um
 
02:58:33.990 --> 02:58:34.000 align:start position:0%
balanced budget Amendments have two
 
02:58:37.349 --> 02:58:37.359 align:start position:0%
Escape Clauses war and National
 
02:58:40.110 --> 02:58:40.120 align:start position:0%
Emergency we are right now there are 41
 
02:58:41.349 --> 02:58:41.359 align:start position:0%
National emergencies that we are
 
02:58:44.070 --> 02:58:44.080 align:start position:0%
currently in going back to Jimmy Carter
 
02:58:46.990 --> 02:58:47.000 align:start position:0%
okay and um National National
 
02:58:49.349 --> 02:58:49.359 align:start position:0%
emergencies are not in the Constitution
 
02:58:51.550 --> 02:58:51.560 align:start position:0%
so if this is passed You' not only will
 
02:58:53.870 --> 02:58:53.880 align:start position:0%
you give Congress no incentive or the
 
02:58:55.670 --> 02:58:55.680 align:start position:0%
president to get out of a national
 
02:58:57.990 --> 02:58:58.000 align:start position:0%
emergency you'll make that
 
02:59:00.150 --> 02:59:00.160 align:start position:0%
constitutional okay the other thing too
 
02:59:02.750 --> 02:59:02.760 align:start position:0%
is uh a balanced budget again we need a
 
02:59:04.950 --> 02:59:04.960 align:start position:0%
constitutional budget not a balanced
 
02:59:07.630 --> 02:59:07.640 align:start position:0%
budget a balanced budget May mean
 
02:59:11.269 --> 02:59:11.279 align:start position:0%
massive tax hikes it may mean massive
 
02:59:12.870 --> 02:59:12.880 align:start position:0%
cutting of federal funds at the state
 
02:59:14.790 --> 02:59:14.800 align:start position:0%
level which in my opinion it wasn't such
 
02:59:17.030 --> 02:59:17.040 align:start position:0%
a bad idea which then if you don't cut
 
02:59:18.349 --> 02:59:18.359 align:start position:0%
the size of government you'll have to
 
02:59:21.349 --> 02:59:21.359 align:start position:0%
raise state taxes so say sometimes
 
02:59:23.389 --> 02:59:23.399 align:start position:0%
things sound good in fact in 1988 when I
 
02:59:24.790 --> 02:59:24.800 align:start position:0%
first heard about this I thought what
 
02:59:26.150 --> 02:59:26.160 align:start position:0%
would be against a balanced budget
 
02:59:27.750 --> 02:59:27.760 align:start position:0%
amendment but then you got to read the
 
02:59:30.389 --> 02:59:30.399 align:start position:0%
fine print and with that I thank
 
02:59:34.870 --> 02:59:34.880 align:start position:0%
you thank you Mr Sheriff uh pressing
 
02:59:38.030 --> 02:59:38.040 align:start position:0%
questions if you have one uh sound
 
02:59:40.870 --> 02:59:40.880 align:start position:0%
off okay Haley Shaw is still is Haley
 
02:59:43.830 --> 02:59:43.840 align:start position:0%
still there Haley spoke earlier um Haley
 
02:59:45.309 --> 02:59:45.319 align:start position:0%
if you could take a minute or two to
 
02:59:51.269 --> 02:59:51.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:54.070 --> 02:59:54.080 align:start position:0%
measure hi Haley Shaw Allenstown New
 
02:59:56.150 --> 02:59:56.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire representing uh Convention of
 
02:59:58.830 --> 02:59:58.840 align:start position:0%
States action um I'm going to keep it
 
03:00:00.990 --> 03:00:01.000 align:start position:0%
really simple I think it's in the best
 
03:00:03.429 --> 03:00:03.439 align:start position:0%
interest of New Hampshire moving
 
03:00:06.309 --> 03:00:06.319 align:start position:0%
forward uh I'm against this by the way I
 
03:00:09.670 --> 03:00:09.680 align:start position:0%
forgot to say that sorry
 
03:00:13.030 --> 03:00:13.040 align:start position:0%
um well just have to make it clear um I
 
03:00:14.550 --> 03:00:14.560 align:start position:0%
think it's probably the best interest of
 
03:00:16.750 --> 03:00:16.760 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire moving forward with
 
03:00:19.990 --> 03:00:20.000 align:start position:0%
discussions of runaway conventions or
 
03:00:21.750 --> 03:00:21.760 align:start position:0%
Rogue Commissioners or anything like
 
03:00:23.150 --> 03:00:23.160 align:start position:0%
that I think it's in the best interest
 
03:00:26.070 --> 03:00:26.080 align:start position:0%
of your state to you know feel if you
 
03:00:30.030 --> 03:00:30.040 align:start position:0%
need to protect yourself and pass what I
 
03:00:32.750 --> 03:00:32.760 align:start position:0%
would call a model legislation uh for
 
03:00:35.229 --> 03:00:35.239 align:start position:0%
selecting Commissioners so what is the
 
03:00:37.150 --> 03:00:37.160 align:start position:0%
process for selecting a commissioner in
 
03:00:39.150 --> 03:00:39.160 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire um I have something
 
03:00:41.309 --> 03:00:41.319 align:start position:0%
similar to that right here but that
 
03:00:43.790 --> 03:00:43.800 align:start position:0%
displays and walks through the entire
 
03:00:46.269 --> 03:00:46.279 align:start position:0%
process for any delegate that would go
 
03:00:49.150 --> 03:00:49.160 align:start position:0%
to a convention for New Hampshire uh it
 
03:00:51.990 --> 03:00:52.000 align:start position:0%
also would identify what would happen if
 
03:00:55.510 --> 03:00:55.520 align:start position:0%
they do go Rogue um and you could you
 
03:00:57.630 --> 03:00:57.640 align:start position:0%
know have criminal penalties put on them
 
03:00:59.950 --> 03:00:59.960 align:start position:0%
so I would say moving forward it's
 
03:01:02.110 --> 03:01:02.120 align:start position:0%
probably in your best interest to pass
 
03:01:04.030 --> 03:01:04.040 align:start position:0%
legislation that protects you and the
 
03:01:06.349 --> 03:01:06.359 align:start position:0%
way to do that is with something like a
 
03:01:08.990 --> 03:01:09.000 align:start position:0%
faithful delegate so that's that's all I
 
03:01:10.269 --> 03:01:10.279 align:start position:0%
have to say
 
03:01:12.630 --> 03:01:12.640 align:start position:0%
thanks thank you
 
03:01:12.640 --> 03:01:15.110 align:start position:0%
thanks thank you
Haley

03:01:15.110 --> 03:01:15.120 align:start position:0%
Haley
 
03:01:17.790 --> 03:01:17.800 align:start position:0%
okay uh Al B brandino has opposed to the
 
03:01:19.750 --> 03:01:19.760 align:start position:0%
bill of course he supported the previous
 
03:01:23.550 --> 03:01:23.560 align:start position:0%
measure uh Al's already spoken um on the
 
03:01:25.030 --> 03:01:25.040 align:start position:0%
previous measure Al if you could take a
 
03:01:27.550 --> 03:01:27.560 align:start position:0%
minute or two on on this
 
03:01:30.070 --> 03:01:30.080 align:start position:0%
one thank you sir
 
03:01:33.429 --> 03:01:33.439 align:start position:0%
um I am opposed uh to this bill and I'm
 
03:01:36.030 --> 03:01:36.040 align:start position:0%
representing the convention of States uh
 
03:01:37.309 --> 03:01:37.319 align:start position:0%
I'm the state director here in New
 
03:01:40.030 --> 03:01:40.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire on this um I want to just
 
03:01:41.950 --> 03:01:41.960 align:start position:0%
start with the word courage and the noun
 
03:01:43.630 --> 03:01:43.640 align:start position:0%
it's a noun the ability to do something
 
03:01:45.790 --> 03:01:45.800 align:start position:0%
something that frightens
 
03:01:49.070 --> 03:01:49.080 align:start position:0%
one so what is the solution I ask the
 
03:01:50.910 --> 03:01:50.920 align:start position:0%
people in opposition to this what is the
 
03:01:54.550 --> 03:01:54.560 align:start position:0%
solution hope is no longer an option uh
 
03:01:57.070 --> 03:01:57.080 align:start position:0%
all of us are you swore an oath and if
 
03:01:58.429 --> 03:01:58.439 align:start position:0%
you're in the military swear oath
 
03:02:00.349 --> 03:02:00.359 align:start position:0%
forever I didn't realize that but you
 
03:02:02.389 --> 03:02:02.399 align:start position:0%
swear an oath to the Constitution New
 
03:02:04.950 --> 03:02:04.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and the US Constitution and
 
03:02:06.830 --> 03:02:06.840 align:start position:0%
specifically for us you know our civic
 
03:02:09.950 --> 03:02:09.960 align:start position:0%
duty puts us above
 
03:02:13.190 --> 03:02:13.200 align:start position:0%
um a above party right we do this for
 
03:02:14.870 --> 03:02:14.880 align:start position:0%
our country country we do it for the
 
03:02:17.190 --> 03:02:17.200 align:start position:0%
Constitution so if you look specifically
 
03:02:21.229 --> 03:02:21.239 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire part one article 18 and 38
 
03:02:23.550 --> 03:02:23.560 align:start position:0%
gives you your direction and our
 
03:02:25.950 --> 03:02:25.960 align:start position:0%
Direction so to the fair Merchants that
 
03:02:27.349 --> 03:02:27.359 align:start position:0%
we heard today what else in the
 
03:02:29.710 --> 03:02:29.720 align:start position:0%
Constitution shouldn't we follow think
 
03:02:32.150 --> 03:02:32.160 align:start position:0%
about those young soldiers or men and
 
03:02:34.309 --> 03:02:34.319 align:start position:0%
women in a foxhole in Afghanistan or
 
03:02:36.469 --> 03:02:36.479 align:start position:0%
Iran when they were being overrun did
 
03:02:38.070 --> 03:02:38.080 align:start position:0%
they sit there and say gez I want
 
03:02:39.630 --> 03:02:39.640 align:start position:0%
everyone to know that I was only for the
 
03:02:41.910 --> 03:02:41.920 align:start position:0%
first and third uh amendment I wasn't
 
03:02:43.070 --> 03:02:43.080 align:start position:0%
for all the amendments of the
 
03:02:45.590 --> 03:02:45.600 align:start position:0%
Constitution does that make any sense
 
03:02:47.990 --> 03:02:48.000 align:start position:0%
doesn't make any sense at all it's all
 
03:02:50.630 --> 03:02:50.640 align:start position:0%
or none you can't pick and
 
03:02:53.110 --> 03:02:53.120 align:start position:0%
choose uh the most despicable fear of
 
03:02:54.790 --> 03:02:54.800 align:start position:0%
all I heard today was that men and women
 
03:02:56.710 --> 03:02:56.720 align:start position:0%
don't have the intestinal fortitude and
 
03:02:59.670 --> 03:02:59.680 align:start position:0%
they aren't the people that they were in
 
03:03:03.670 --> 03:03:03.680 align:start position:0%
1789 oh my gosh do I beg to disagree I
 
03:03:05.870 --> 03:03:05.880 align:start position:0%
have to tell you do you think uh Abraham
 
03:03:07.389 --> 03:03:07.399 align:start position:0%
Lincoln's father knew he was going to
 
03:03:09.590 --> 03:03:09.600 align:start position:0%
have Abraham Lincoln a Mother Teresa's
 
03:03:10.950 --> 03:03:10.960 align:start position:0%
mother knew she was going to have mother
 
03:03:15.110 --> 03:03:15.120 align:start position:0%
traser or uh and and with the people we
 
03:03:16.710 --> 03:03:16.720 align:start position:0%
don't know what we're going to be you
 
03:03:18.309 --> 03:03:18.319 align:start position:0%
didn't know as Representatives that you
 
03:03:20.030 --> 03:03:20.040 align:start position:0%
were going to be here but something
 
03:03:21.990 --> 03:03:22.000 align:start position:0%
changed in your life that made you do it
 
03:03:24.389 --> 03:03:24.399 align:start position:0%
it's courage right courage to do
 
03:03:26.269 --> 03:03:26.279 align:start position:0%
something that we're afraid
 
03:03:29.309 --> 03:03:29.319 align:start position:0%
of and the last bit that really troubles
 
03:03:29.319 --> 03:03:30.790 align:start position:0%
of and the last bit that really troubles
me

03:03:30.790 --> 03:03:30.800 align:start position:0%
me
 
03:03:33.830 --> 03:03:33.840 align:start position:0%
is the nonsense of fearmongers the last
 
03:03:36.190 --> 03:03:36.200 align:start position:0%
one a substitute of the Constitution is
 
03:03:37.830 --> 03:03:37.840 align:start position:0%
that you're going to have George Soros
 
03:03:40.070 --> 03:03:40.080 align:start position:0%
and Mark meckler and everyone else
 
03:03:42.870 --> 03:03:42.880 align:start position:0%
appoint and create a constitution come
 
03:03:44.750 --> 03:03:44.760 align:start position:0%
on this is really nonsense and shouldn't
 
03:03:47.150 --> 03:03:47.160 align:start position:0%
even be considered I want to leave you
 
03:03:49.910 --> 03:03:49.920 align:start position:0%
with this with courage with the ability
 
03:03:51.910 --> 03:03:51.920 align:start position:0%
to do something that makes you afraid
 
03:03:53.950 --> 03:03:53.960 align:start position:0%
and do what's right for the people
 
03:03:58.870 --> 03:03:58.880 align:start position:0%
please thank you thank you Mr
 
03:04:02.469 --> 03:04:02.479 align:start position:0%
brandano saying no hands up uh we'll go
 
03:04:05.830 --> 03:04:05.840 align:start position:0%
to representative JD Bernardi who spoke
 
03:04:08.349 --> 03:04:08.359 align:start position:0%
earlier uh in support of the previous
 
03:04:12.550 --> 03:04:12.560 align:start position:0%
Bill and he's opposing this bill um
 
03:04:15.150 --> 03:04:15.160 align:start position:0%
welcome representative
 
03:04:16.429 --> 03:04:16.439 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
03:04:19.110 --> 03:04:19.120 align:start position:0%
committee uh again JD Bernardi
 
03:04:22.910 --> 03:04:22.920 align:start position:0%
Rockingham 36 uh I I just want to
 
03:04:25.469 --> 03:04:25.479 align:start position:0%
reflect again on one of the statements I
 
03:04:28.510 --> 03:04:28.520 align:start position:0%
made earlier I served in a simulated uh
 
03:04:30.670 --> 03:04:30.680 align:start position:0%
convention this last summer with
 
03:04:33.190 --> 03:04:33.200 align:start position:0%
representative massamillo we stayed on
 
03:04:36.229 --> 03:04:36.239 align:start position:0%
target we didn't pass any resolution to
 
03:04:38.190 --> 03:04:38.200 align:start position:0%
get rid of the Second Amendment we
 
03:04:41.950 --> 03:04:41.960 align:start position:0%
stayed on target runaway was not the
 
03:04:44.229 --> 03:04:44.239 align:start position:0%
problem the other point I want to make
 
03:04:46.429 --> 03:04:46.439 align:start position:0%
is we've heard again and again that that
 
03:04:50.150 --> 03:04:50.160 align:start position:0%
that because the article itself Article
 
03:04:52.830 --> 03:04:52.840 align:start position:0%
5 doesn't have any mechanism of how the
 
03:04:55.469 --> 03:04:55.479 align:start position:0%
convention is supposed to be conducted
 
03:04:57.990 --> 03:04:58.000 align:start position:0%
it you know it's it's going to be a
 
03:05:00.469 --> 03:05:00.479 align:start position:0%
crazed event that's going to go all over
 
03:05:03.790 --> 03:05:03.800 align:start position:0%
the place well the Constitution's only
 
03:05:07.510 --> 03:05:07.520 align:start position:0%
about 4,000 plus words and it has a lot
 
03:05:10.150 --> 03:05:10.160 align:start position:0%
of things in it that are not highly
 
03:05:13.510 --> 03:05:13.520 align:start position:0%
specified we pass laws to deal with
 
03:05:16.750 --> 03:05:16.760 align:start position:0%
flushing those things out and we use
 
03:05:19.469 --> 03:05:19.479 align:start position:0%
tradition and the tradition of
 
03:05:23.150 --> 03:05:23.160 align:start position:0%
conventions has been one state one vote
 
03:05:26.229 --> 03:05:26.239 align:start position:0%
delegates chosen by the state
 
03:05:29.070 --> 03:05:29.080 align:start position:0%
legislators those those delegates are
 
03:05:31.710 --> 03:05:31.720 align:start position:0%
faithful to the state
 
03:05:34.670 --> 03:05:34.680 align:start position:0%
legislators so you have an example of
 
03:05:38.429 --> 03:05:38.439 align:start position:0%
that in the 1861 peace conference which
 
03:05:41.429 --> 03:05:41.439 align:start position:0%
was an article 5 convention to try to
 
03:05:44.110 --> 03:05:44.120 align:start position:0%
thwart what was going on with the what
 
03:05:46.790 --> 03:05:46.800 align:start position:0%
became the Civil War so there are
 
03:05:49.550 --> 03:05:49.560 align:start position:0%
examples it works it worked in the
 
03:05:51.710 --> 03:05:51.720 align:start position:0%
simulated convention it it's worked in
 
03:05:55.590 --> 03:05:55.600 align:start position:0%
our history uh I urge you to reject this
 
03:05:58.070 --> 03:05:58.080 align:start position:0%
resolution and continue to support the
 
03:06:02.030 --> 03:06:02.040 align:start position:0%
need for a Balan budget amendment uh or
 
03:06:04.670 --> 03:06:04.680 align:start position:0%
or and and I want to reflect on the
 
03:06:07.349 --> 03:06:07.359 align:start position:0%
words that uh Mr shirtliff said that
 
03:06:10.429 --> 03:06:10.439 align:start position:0%
because it it had uh some Escape clause
 
03:06:14.030 --> 03:06:14.040 align:start position:0%
in there remember the resolution allows
 
03:06:16.750 --> 03:06:16.760 align:start position:0%
the representative to go to the
 
03:06:18.870 --> 03:06:18.880 align:start position:0%
convention and discuss with the
 
03:06:20.950 --> 03:06:20.960 align:start position:0%
delegates from the other states and
 
03:06:24.389 --> 03:06:24.399 align:start position:0%
craft the amendment that resolution is
 
03:06:27.150 --> 03:06:27.160 align:start position:0%
not the amendment it's the operating
 
03:06:29.990 --> 03:06:30.000 align:start position:0%
parameters which you use to generate
 
03:06:32.150 --> 03:06:32.160 align:start position:0%
Amendment which then comes back to the
 
03:06:34.950 --> 03:06:34.960 align:start position:0%
to at least 38 states to ratify thank
 
03:06:37.550 --> 03:06:37.560 align:start position:0%
you very much thank you
 
03:06:41.269 --> 03:06:41.279 align:start position:0%
representative and uh seeing No Hands we
 
03:06:44.870 --> 03:06:44.880 align:start position:0%
will Press On uh Sam fieldman has asked
 
03:06:47.110 --> 03:06:47.120 align:start position:0%
for one to two minutes to uh speak in
 
03:06:49.510 --> 03:06:49.520 align:start position:0%
opposition to the bill Sam has spoken
 
03:06:52.150 --> 03:06:52.160 align:start position:0%
earlier and there he is uh welcome back
 
03:06:53.349 --> 03:06:53.359 align:start position:0%
thank you I promise it'll be nothing
 
03:06:57.790 --> 03:06:57.800 align:start position:0%
that I've said before um the the groups
 
03:06:59.790 --> 03:06:59.800 align:start position:0%
that you're seeing here um opposing this
 
03:07:02.710 --> 03:07:02.720 align:start position:0%
resolution are groups like Wolfpack uh
 
03:07:04.870 --> 03:07:04.880 align:start position:0%
Convention of States us term limits
 
03:07:06.670 --> 03:07:06.680 align:start position:0%
these are all separate groups none of
 
03:07:08.429 --> 03:07:08.439 align:start position:0%
whom have any particular interest in
 
03:07:10.870 --> 03:07:10.880 align:start position:0%
this particular resolution they are all
 
03:07:13.790 --> 03:07:13.800 align:start position:0%
as as Mr venidas pointed out uh pushing
 
03:07:15.429 --> 03:07:15.439 align:start position:0%
back against the language in this
 
03:07:17.469 --> 03:07:17.479 align:start position:0%
Precision if you were sined simply
 
03:07:19.990 --> 03:07:20.000 align:start position:0%
because you no longer agree with the
 
03:07:22.510 --> 03:07:22.520 align:start position:0%
balanced budget amendment uh effort I
 
03:07:24.030 --> 03:07:24.040 align:start position:0%
have no problem with that I don't think
 
03:07:27.190 --> 03:07:27.200 align:start position:0%
any of the other groups are um and it's
 
03:07:28.229 --> 03:07:28.239 align:start position:0%
important to keep in mind that these
 
03:07:30.550 --> 03:07:30.560 align:start position:0%
groups are also separate from each other
 
03:07:31.910 --> 03:07:31.920 align:start position:0%
and things that apply to one do not
 
03:07:33.670 --> 03:07:33.680 align:start position:0%
necessarily apply to another in terms of
 
03:07:35.510 --> 03:07:35.520 align:start position:0%
their political activity I make it a
 
03:07:37.030 --> 03:07:37.040 align:start position:0%
point to be an expert not only on the
 
03:07:38.910 --> 03:07:38.920 align:start position:0%
convention process itself but also on
 
03:07:40.630 --> 03:07:40.640 align:start position:0%
the political activity of the different
 
03:07:43.389 --> 03:07:43.399 align:start position:0%
groups and how they operate and in
 
03:07:44.990 --> 03:07:45.000 align:start position:0%
particular you'll notice one group that
 
03:07:46.790 --> 03:07:46.800 align:start position:0%
you are not seeing here is any group
 
03:07:48.630 --> 03:07:48.640 align:start position:0%
that is specifically working on the
 
03:07:49.870 --> 03:07:49.880 align:start position:0%
effort to get a balanced budget
 
03:07:51.469 --> 03:07:51.479 align:start position:0%
amendment and there's an important
 
03:07:54.269 --> 03:07:54.279 align:start position:0%
reason for that uh they also don't
 
03:07:55.990 --> 03:07:56.000 align:start position:0%
particularly care one way or the other
 
03:07:59.469 --> 03:07:59.479 align:start position:0%
if you resend this uh 2012 call from uh
 
03:08:01.309 --> 03:08:01.319 align:start position:0%
from New Hampshire and the reason is
 
03:08:02.870 --> 03:08:02.880 align:start position:0%
after doing further research they've
 
03:08:04.670 --> 03:08:04.680 align:start position:0%
come to the conclusion and frankly I
 
03:08:07.429 --> 03:08:07.439 align:start position:0%
think they are correct uh that in as of
 
03:08:11.870 --> 03:08:11.880 align:start position:0%
1983 there were already 34 calls for a
 
03:08:13.710 --> 03:08:13.720 align:start position:0%
uh a convention Limited to the issue of
 
03:08:16.110 --> 03:08:16.120 align:start position:0%
fiscal responsibility and once you hit
 
03:08:19.790 --> 03:08:19.800 align:start position:0%
34 subsequent recisions no longer matter
 
03:08:21.590 --> 03:08:21.600 align:start position:0%
you've got an agreement from the states
 
03:08:23.630 --> 03:08:23.640 align:start position:0%
for a convention limited to that subject
 
03:08:25.870 --> 03:08:25.880 align:start position:0%
matter and whatever happens after that
 
03:08:28.190 --> 03:08:28.200 align:start position:0%
doesn't matter it's already enforcable
 
03:08:31.830 --> 03:08:31.840 align:start position:0%
as of that point um that is many of
 
03:08:32.990 --> 03:08:33.000 align:start position:0%
those convention calls that they are
 
03:08:34.950 --> 03:08:34.960 align:start position:0%
relying on have since been rescinded and
 
03:08:36.710 --> 03:08:36.720 align:start position:0%
are not available to be used by the
 
03:08:40.150 --> 03:08:40.160 align:start position:0%
other uh groups which is why this has uh
 
03:08:42.030 --> 03:08:42.040 align:start position:0%
their argument has no bearing on what
 
03:08:44.590 --> 03:08:44.600 align:start position:0%
the other groups are working on um and
 
03:08:46.630 --> 03:08:46.640 align:start position:0%
also why they don't care about this
 
03:08:48.429 --> 03:08:48.439 align:start position:0%
particular recision and the ones who do
 
03:08:50.950 --> 03:08:50.960 align:start position:0%
care about uh about it care only about
 
03:08:53.269 --> 03:08:53.279 align:start position:0%
the language not the actual attempt to
 
03:08:57.190 --> 03:08:57.200 align:start position:0%
resend um it's also very similar HCR 24
 
03:08:59.870 --> 03:08:59.880 align:start position:0%
in Congress is uh doing something very
 
03:09:00.990 --> 03:09:01.000 align:start position:0%
similar and that it's looking
 
03:09:02.990 --> 03:09:03.000 align:start position:0%
specifically at these different calls
 
03:09:04.349 --> 03:09:04.359 align:start position:0%
limited to the issue of fiscal
 
03:09:06.590 --> 03:09:06.600 align:start position:0%
responsibility as well I think that
 
03:09:09.229 --> 03:09:09.239 align:start position:0%
particular resolution is not worded
 
03:09:10.510 --> 03:09:10.520 align:start position:0%
particularly well but it's also not
 
03:09:11.630 --> 03:09:11.640 align:start position:0%
going to pass so it doesn't really
 
03:09:14.670 --> 03:09:14.680 align:start position:0%
matter um so it's easy to misconstrue as
 
03:09:15.910 --> 03:09:15.920 align:start position:0%
something that's intended to combine
 
03:09:17.269 --> 03:09:17.279 align:start position:0%
different topics but that is not the
 
03:09:19.750 --> 03:09:19.760 align:start position:0%
intent or what it actually
 
03:09:25.190 --> 03:09:25.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:27.950 --> 03:09:27.960 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thanks again uh
 
03:09:33.590 --> 03:09:33.600 align:start position:0%
Sam I have two more cards here on hcr9
 
03:09:36.790 --> 03:09:36.800 align:start position:0%
um Ken Quinn has spoken earlier uh Mr
 
03:09:40.550 --> 03:09:40.560 align:start position:0%
Quinn uh there he is you mentioned uh
 
03:09:42.309 --> 03:09:42.319 align:start position:0%
you have written testimony which we
 
03:09:45.950 --> 03:09:45.960 align:start position:0%
appreciate um was that the for the
 
03:09:48.349 --> 03:09:48.359 align:start position:0%
previous measure or for this one or for
 
03:09:50.710 --> 03:09:50.720 align:start position:0%
both the the written testimony that
 
03:09:52.630 --> 03:09:52.640 align:start position:0%
you're cired mentions yeah I provided
 
03:09:53.990 --> 03:09:54.000 align:start position:0%
one for
 
03:09:57.030 --> 03:09:57.040 align:start position:0%
each testimony so there's there's a
 
03:09:59.229 --> 03:09:59.239 align:start position:0%
separate written testimony for nine as
 
03:10:01.790 --> 03:10:01.800 align:start position:0%
opposed to exactly for both yeah I I I
 
03:10:04.510 --> 03:10:04.520 align:start position:0%
handed it in for nine as well okay I got
 
03:10:08.830 --> 03:10:08.840 align:start position:0%
you speak um okay and uh we have a
 
03:10:10.590 --> 03:10:10.600 align:start position:0%
couple minutes for you to speak to this
 
03:10:13.110 --> 03:10:13.120 align:start position:0%
one as well thank you so much yes I uh
 
03:10:15.110 --> 03:10:15.120 align:start position:0%
again Ken Quinn
 
03:10:17.990 --> 03:10:18.000 align:start position:0%
um I will give you some new information
 
03:10:20.710 --> 03:10:20.720 align:start position:0%
it's actually old information and I'm
 
03:10:22.630 --> 03:10:22.640 align:start position:0%
like to just point out that this
 
03:10:26.190 --> 03:10:26.200 align:start position:0%
resolution hcr9 was downloaded by the
 
03:10:28.269 --> 03:10:28.279 align:start position:0%
John off of the John bir society's
 
03:10:30.349 --> 03:10:30.359 align:start position:0%
website this is their model language for
 
03:10:30.359 --> 03:10:31.510 align:start position:0%
website this is their model language for
resend

03:10:31.510 --> 03:10:31.520 align:start position:0%
resend
 
03:10:33.389 --> 03:10:33.399 align:start position:0%
resolutions and I find it quite
 
03:10:35.790 --> 03:10:35.800 align:start position:0%
interesting that even in their model
 
03:10:39.110 --> 03:10:39.120 align:start position:0%
language they mention a limited
 
03:10:43.550 --> 03:10:43.560 align:start position:0%
convention so I I find that very ironic
 
03:10:46.030 --> 03:10:46.040 align:start position:0%
um something about the John bir society
 
03:10:47.750 --> 03:10:47.760 align:start position:0%
and and this is what you really need to
 
03:10:50.349 --> 03:10:50.359 align:start position:0%
understand the John bir Society from its
 
03:10:52.950 --> 03:10:52.960 align:start position:0%
very beginning uses fear let me just
 
03:10:54.910 --> 03:10:54.920 align:start position:0%
give you some examples the founder
 
03:10:58.269 --> 03:10:58.279 align:start position:0%
Robert Welch okay um M Mr qu really want
 
03:11:01.110 --> 03:11:01.120 align:start position:0%
to focus on the language of the proposed
 
03:11:03.710 --> 03:11:03.720 align:start position:0%
resolution I will as opposed to uh
 
03:11:08.429 --> 03:11:08.439 align:start position:0%
getting into uh the the motives and the
 
03:11:13.070 --> 03:11:13.080 align:start position:0%
character of uh I understand so uh carry
 
03:11:16.309 --> 03:11:16.319 align:start position:0%
on the resolution itself is very uh
 
03:11:18.030 --> 03:11:18.040 align:start position:0%
convoluted because it refers to the
 
03:11:20.349 --> 03:11:20.359 align:start position:0%
Declaration of Independence um the
 
03:11:22.910 --> 03:11:22.920 align:start position:0%
Declaration of Independence is from
 
03:11:26.950 --> 03:11:26.960 align:start position:0%
1776 Article 5 was not established at
 
03:11:29.190 --> 03:11:29.200 align:start position:0%
that time so the law the current law
 
03:11:30.670 --> 03:11:30.680 align:start position:0%
that we are under and that the states
 
03:11:33.150 --> 03:11:33.160 align:start position:0%
are under is Article 5 under the
 
03:11:36.150 --> 03:11:36.160 align:start position:0%
Constitution which was ratified by New
 
03:11:38.630 --> 03:11:38.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire the 9th state in
 
03:11:42.550 --> 03:11:42.560 align:start position:0%
1788 so to try to use the language from
 
03:11:45.070 --> 03:11:45.080 align:start position:0%
the Declaration of Independence as a
 
03:11:47.229 --> 03:11:47.239 align:start position:0%
sovereign convention under Article 5
 
03:11:51.790 --> 03:11:51.800 align:start position:0%
makes absolutely no sense it is just
 
03:11:55.269 --> 03:11:55.279 align:start position:0%
what article 5 is is the principle of
 
03:11:57.590 --> 03:11:57.600 align:start position:0%
allowing the people to alter their form
 
03:11:59.269 --> 03:11:59.279 align:start position:0%
of government when they feel it's
 
03:12:00.990 --> 03:12:01.000 align:start position:0%
necessary so they actually put that
 
03:12:05.110 --> 03:12:05.120 align:start position:0%
principle in Article 5 and that's why we
 
03:12:07.630 --> 03:12:07.640 align:start position:0%
have this ability Congress can propose
 
03:12:09.550 --> 03:12:09.560 align:start position:0%
amendments if you notice the language of
 
03:12:12.790 --> 03:12:12.800 align:start position:0%
Article 5 says amendments in the plural
 
03:12:14.429 --> 03:12:14.439 align:start position:0%
but it's in plural for both when
 
03:12:17.990 --> 03:12:18.000 align:start position:0%
Congress proposes and when the states
 
03:12:21.030 --> 03:12:21.040 align:start position:0%
propose now the only time out of the
 
03:12:23.190 --> 03:12:23.200 align:start position:0%
11,000 amendments Congress has ever
 
03:12:25.030 --> 03:12:25.040 align:start position:0%
proposed more than one amendment was the
 
03:12:27.389 --> 03:12:27.399 align:start position:0%
Bill of Rights so every other amendment
 
03:12:31.070 --> 03:12:31.080 align:start position:0%
has been a single Amendment which means
 
03:12:33.469 --> 03:12:33.479 align:start position:0%
since Article 5 is equal between the
 
03:12:35.710 --> 03:12:35.720 align:start position:0%
state legislatures and Congress the
 
03:12:37.750 --> 03:12:37.760 align:start position:0%
states have the authority and the right
 
03:12:40.670 --> 03:12:40.680 align:start position:0%
to propose a single Amendment and that's
 
03:12:44.790 --> 03:12:44.800 align:start position:0%
exactly what Federalist paper state
 
03:12:47.710 --> 03:12:47.720 align:start position:0%
federal st85 if the unit if the states
 
03:12:51.349 --> 03:12:51.359 align:start position:0%
are united in a particular Amendment so
 
03:12:53.590 --> 03:12:53.600 align:start position:0%
it's very clear and I'm glad that the
 
03:12:56.030 --> 03:12:56.040 align:start position:0%
John Birch society's model language
 
03:13:00.389 --> 03:13:00.399 align:start position:0%
identifies a limited convention um this
 
03:13:02.950 --> 03:13:02.960 align:start position:0%
idea of a runaway again is all based on
 
03:13:04.790 --> 03:13:04.800 align:start position:0%
a misunderstanding or rewriting of
 
03:13:07.070 --> 03:13:07.080 align:start position:0%
History where it's a dishonoring of the
 
03:13:08.710 --> 03:13:08.720 align:start position:0%
framers they want you to believe that we
 
03:13:11.429 --> 03:13:11.439 align:start position:0%
have an illegal Constitution the framers
 
03:13:13.790 --> 03:13:13.800 align:start position:0%
did not violate their Commissions in
 
03:13:18.030 --> 03:13:18.040 align:start position:0%
fact if you read the Virginia call it
 
03:13:20.830 --> 03:13:20.840 align:start position:0%
does not require the state legislators
 
03:13:24.670 --> 03:13:24.680 align:start position:0%
to confirm the uh the ratification or
 
03:13:28.590 --> 03:13:28.600 align:start position:0%
the adoption of the uh Constitution the
 
03:13:31.389 --> 03:13:31.399 align:start position:0%
ratification process was left in the if
 
03:13:34.750 --> 03:13:34.760 align:start position:0%
you read the the language to the states
 
03:13:37.190 --> 03:13:37.200 align:start position:0%
meaning either state legislators could
 
03:13:39.590 --> 03:13:39.600 align:start position:0%
ratify the Constitution or the people in
 
03:13:41.630 --> 03:13:41.640 align:start position:0%
convention so they even provided for
 
03:13:44.309 --> 03:13:44.319 align:start position:0%
that so to claim that they violated the
 
03:13:47.750 --> 03:13:47.760 align:start position:0%
very ratification process is absolutely
 
03:13:50.349 --> 03:13:50.359 align:start position:0%
untrue so with that I will end my
 
03:13:52.190 --> 03:13:52.200 align:start position:0%
testimony thank
 
03:13:56.190 --> 03:13:56.200 align:start position:0%
you thanks again Mr Quinn uh
 
03:13:56.200 --> 03:13:58.030 align:start position:0%
you thanks again Mr Quinn uh
questions

03:13:58.030 --> 03:13:58.040 align:start position:0%
questions
 
03:14:01.870 --> 03:14:01.880 align:start position:0%
uh we do have uh one more now two more
 
03:14:05.510 --> 03:14:05.520 align:start position:0%
cards uh Jim Jim
 
03:14:08.630 --> 03:14:08.640 align:start position:0%
loose 69 old Hancock road I don't know
 
03:14:10.990 --> 03:14:11.000 align:start position:0%
what community that is but I'm sure
 
03:14:15.229 --> 03:14:15.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:17.750 --> 03:14:17.760 align:start position:0%
in Hancock New Hampshire all right uh M
 
03:14:20.910 --> 03:14:20.920 align:start position:0%
loose uh you you did not speak to the
 
03:14:22.389 --> 03:14:22.399 align:start position:0%
you haven't spoken yet today is that
 
03:14:24.990 --> 03:14:25.000 align:start position:0%
correct no right so uh take at least a
 
03:14:27.389 --> 03:14:27.399 align:start position:0%
couple minutes sure uh welcome I'll try
 
03:14:29.389 --> 03:14:29.399 align:start position:0%
to be thank you very much Mr chairman
 
03:14:33.190 --> 03:14:33.200 align:start position:0%
and thank you all uh I know I I don't
 
03:14:35.830 --> 03:14:35.840 align:start position:0%
attend these and I'm very impressed with
 
03:14:37.830 --> 03:14:37.840 align:start position:0%
the manner in which this is conducted
 
03:14:39.550 --> 03:14:39.560 align:start position:0%
which I believe in effect would be the
 
03:14:42.150 --> 03:14:42.160 align:start position:0%
manner in which uh Convention of States
 
03:14:44.349 --> 03:14:44.359 align:start position:0%
would be conducted I happen to be
 
03:14:48.630 --> 03:14:48.640 align:start position:0%
against this resolution uh to resend uh
 
03:14:50.190 --> 03:14:50.200 align:start position:0%
simply because I think it's a bit of a
 
03:14:53.030 --> 03:14:53.040 align:start position:0%
troan horse and I think it was designed
 
03:14:56.950 --> 03:14:56.960 align:start position:0%
to uh probably undermine the capacity to
 
03:15:00.550 --> 03:15:00.560 align:start position:0%
uh conduct uh similar types of uh uh
 
03:15:03.790 --> 03:15:03.800 align:start position:0%
conventions uh and I think if it's if
 
03:15:05.309 --> 03:15:05.319 align:start position:0%
it's accepted unfortunately it's going
 
03:15:07.590 --> 03:15:07.600 align:start position:0%
to undermine that that opportunity in
 
03:15:10.150 --> 03:15:10.160 align:start position:0%
the future and I'm all in favor I think
 
03:15:12.190 --> 03:15:12.200 align:start position:0%
we are uh here in New Hampshire live
 
03:15:15.469 --> 03:15:15.479 align:start position:0%
free die U and I've only lived here for
 
03:15:18.590 --> 03:15:18.600 align:start position:0%
the past four years uh but I I love the
 
03:15:20.910 --> 03:15:20.920 align:start position:0%
spirit of New Hampshire and I think uh
 
03:15:23.790 --> 03:15:23.800 align:start position:0%
the convention of States uh carries that
 
03:15:26.630 --> 03:15:26.640 align:start position:0%
very same kind of spirit which is uh
 
03:15:29.189 --> 03:15:29.199 align:start position:0%
namely we have to have faith uh we can't
 
03:15:31.950 --> 03:15:31.960 align:start position:0%
operate out of fear uh when I hear that
 
03:15:36.309 --> 03:15:36.319 align:start position:0%
U the quality of uh of Americans has
 
03:15:39.189 --> 03:15:39.199 align:start position:0%
dropped uh individually and that's a
 
03:15:42.189 --> 03:15:42.199 align:start position:0%
cause for us not to uh to do this I I
 
03:15:44.110 --> 03:15:44.120 align:start position:0%
I'm offended I know someone else
 
03:15:46.349 --> 03:15:46.359 align:start position:0%
mentioned that I think uh we all have
 
03:15:49.309 --> 03:15:49.319 align:start position:0%
the you know the capacity to rise to the
 
03:15:52.030 --> 03:15:52.040 align:start position:0%
occasion uh and I just wanted to make
 
03:15:55.830 --> 03:15:55.840 align:start position:0%
that clear uh I uh I have faith in the
 
03:15:57.990 --> 03:15:58.000 align:start position:0%
manner which uh this could be carried
 
03:16:01.510 --> 03:16:01.520 align:start position:0%
out um and I think it will be done in a
 
03:16:04.469 --> 03:16:04.479 align:start position:0%
uh professional way and uh we should
 
03:16:08.710 --> 03:16:08.720 align:start position:0%
have uh less concern about fear and we
 
03:16:10.990 --> 03:16:11.000 align:start position:0%
should operate on the basis of faith and
 
03:16:12.870 --> 03:16:12.880 align:start position:0%
courage going forward
 
03:16:16.030 --> 03:16:16.040 align:start position:0%
so I just wanted to share that thank you
 
03:16:18.150 --> 03:16:18.160 align:start position:0%
Mr loose thank you for coming to New
 
03:16:20.229 --> 03:16:20.239 align:start position:0%
Hampshire thank you for coming to the uh
 
03:16:22.189 --> 03:16:22.199 align:start position:0%
to conquer today and thank you for the
 
03:16:28.189 --> 03:16:28.199 align:start position:0%
kind words uh questions for uh Mr
 
03:16:31.590 --> 03:16:31.600 align:start position:0%
loose thanks again thank you the I have
 
03:16:34.389 --> 03:16:34.399 align:start position:0%
in my hand the final pink card uh
 
03:16:37.189 --> 03:16:37.199 align:start position:0%
individuals asked for 30 seconds and we
 
03:16:39.750 --> 03:16:39.760 align:start position:0%
can approximately approximately and we
 
03:16:41.870 --> 03:16:41.880 align:start position:0%
can round that up as necessary uh
 
03:16:44.469 --> 03:16:44.479 align:start position:0%
represent Reed welcome welcome back
 
03:16:47.150 --> 03:16:47.160 align:start position:0%
thank you once again I missed you all um
 
03:16:51.269 --> 03:16:51.279 align:start position:0%
so I am not stating a support or against
 
03:16:54.070 --> 03:16:54.080 align:start position:0%
for this uh particular piece of
 
03:16:56.990 --> 03:16:57.000 align:start position:0%
legislation um if you want to resend a
 
03:16:59.389 --> 03:16:59.399 align:start position:0%
call you should do so on policy my
 
03:17:03.110 --> 03:17:03.120 align:start position:0%
position is um the mechanism here is
 
03:17:04.710 --> 03:17:04.720 align:start position:0%
solid as you already know for all the
 
03:17:07.590 --> 03:17:07.600 align:start position:0%
reasons that have been uh testified to
 
03:17:09.870 --> 03:17:09.880 align:start position:0%
but I did want to challenge one argument
 
03:17:11.670 --> 03:17:11.680 align:start position:0%
we've heard repeatedly whether it's from
 
03:17:14.189 --> 03:17:14.199 align:start position:0%
members of the John Birch Society or
 
03:17:18.030 --> 03:17:18.040 align:start position:0%
whatever opposition um whether or not
 
03:17:20.030 --> 03:17:20.040 align:start position:0%
they properly identified themselves and
 
03:17:22.469 --> 03:17:22.479 align:start position:0%
that is the idea that the federal
 
03:17:25.510 --> 03:17:25.520 align:start position:0%
government the big government is bad The
 
03:17:27.469 --> 03:17:27.479 align:start position:0%
Constitution's purpose the entire
 
03:17:29.229 --> 03:17:29.239 align:start position:0%
purpose of the Constitution the function
 
03:17:31.550 --> 03:17:31.560 align:start position:0%
it has is to limit and restrain the
 
03:17:33.469 --> 03:17:33.479 align:start position:0%
government so they'll say that the big
 
03:17:36.670 --> 03:17:36.680 align:start position:0%
government is bad but we don't want to
 
03:17:38.469 --> 03:17:38.479 align:start position:0%
actually change the Constitution that is
 
03:17:40.110 --> 03:17:40.120 align:start position:0%
actually empowering that government
 
03:17:41.429 --> 03:17:41.439 align:start position:0%
because the Constitution is perfect but
 
03:17:43.510 --> 03:17:43.520 align:start position:0%
if the Constitution is perfect then why
 
03:17:45.790 --> 03:17:45.800 align:start position:0%
is the government bad and that is the
 
03:17:48.349 --> 03:17:48.359 align:start position:0%
kind of Disconnect I wanted to call out
 
03:17:50.790 --> 03:17:50.800 align:start position:0%
and finally I there's the question of
 
03:17:52.790 --> 03:17:52.800 align:start position:0%
whether or not we have the power or you
 
03:17:54.990 --> 03:17:55.000 align:start position:0%
know should we have the power and the
 
03:17:57.070 --> 03:17:57.080 align:start position:0%
Constitution that perfect document that
 
03:17:59.910 --> 03:17:59.920 align:start position:0%
they themselves think is perfect um does
 
03:18:01.670 --> 03:18:01.680 align:start position:0%
operate on federalism it is one of our
 
03:18:03.229 --> 03:18:03.239 align:start position:0%
checks and balances we frequently think
 
03:18:04.630 --> 03:18:04.640 align:start position:0%
of the three branches of government as a
 
03:18:06.429 --> 03:18:06.439 align:start position:0%
check and balance but also it is
 
03:18:08.590 --> 03:18:08.600 align:start position:0%
federalism the tension between the small
 
03:18:10.790 --> 03:18:10.800 align:start position:0%
and the large governments and it's
 
03:18:12.990 --> 03:18:13.000 align:start position:0%
throughout the entire con Constitution
 
03:18:15.830 --> 03:18:15.840 align:start position:0%
that we operate on that principle but I
 
03:18:18.070 --> 03:18:18.080 align:start position:0%
just want to read one specific piece of
 
03:18:20.070 --> 03:18:20.080 align:start position:0%
the Constitution that will reaffirm
 
03:18:21.269 --> 03:18:21.279 align:start position:0%
because when the framers wrote the
 
03:18:22.910 --> 03:18:22.920 align:start position:0%
Constitution they made sure to cover
 
03:18:25.189 --> 03:18:25.199 align:start position:0%
their bases they basically said whatever
 
03:18:27.710 --> 03:18:27.720 align:start position:0%
we didn't cover here is up to the states
 
03:18:29.550 --> 03:18:29.560 align:start position:0%
that is the 10th amendment in the Bill
 
03:18:31.189 --> 03:18:31.199 align:start position:0%
of Rights of the Constitution which says
 
03:18:33.229 --> 03:18:33.239 align:start position:0%
the powers not delegated to the United
 
03:18:35.269 --> 03:18:35.279 align:start position:0%
States by the Constitution nor
 
03:18:38.070 --> 03:18:38.080 align:start position:0%
prohibited by it to the states are
 
03:18:40.229 --> 03:18:40.239 align:start position:0%
reserved to the states respectively or
 
03:18:43.349 --> 03:18:43.359 align:start position:0%
to the people it means whatever we
 
03:18:45.670 --> 03:18:45.680 align:start position:0%

hcr1 passed over 30 years ago the New
 
04:06:59.910 --> 04:06:59.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire legislature in 1991 saw the
 
04:07:02.389 --> 04:07:02.399 align:start position:0%
importance of these clinical trials and
 
04:07:04.790 --> 04:07:04.800 align:start position:0%
took action by passing the resolution to
 
04:07:08.229 --> 04:07:08.239 align:start position:0%
send a message both to the US FDA and
 
04:07:10.590 --> 04:07:10.600 align:start position:0%
also to Granite Staters about their
 
04:07:13.110 --> 04:07:13.120 align:start position:0%
priorities and their bipartisan support
 
04:07:16.149 --> 04:07:16.159 align:start position:0%
for safe legal abortion now we find
 
04:07:17.189 --> 04:07:17.199 align:start position:0%
ourselves in
 
04:07:20.030 --> 04:07:20.040 align:start position:0%
2024 with the very real threat of this
 
04:07:22.510 --> 04:07:22.520 align:start position:0%
Access to Health Care being taken away
 
04:07:25.349 --> 04:07:25.359 align:start position:0%
as the US Supreme Court takes up a case
 
04:07:27.830 --> 04:07:27.840 align:start position:0%
challenging the fda's approval of
 
04:07:30.910 --> 04:07:30.920 align:start position:0%

controversial for decades mffa prisone
 
04:07:39.189 --> 04:07:39.199 align:start position:0%
has been a safe an effective means to
 
04:07:42.269 --> 04:07:42.279 align:start position:0%
obtain an abortion early in
 
04:07:45.189 --> 04:07:45.199 align:start position:0%
pregnancy since the fall of roie Wade
 
04:07:47.309 --> 04:07:47.319 align:start position:0%
there are no longer Federal protections
 
04:07:48.990 --> 04:07:49.000 align:start position:0%
assuring people that they will be able
 
04:07:51.830 --> 04:07:51.840 align:start position:0%
to access abortion we have seen this
 
04:07:54.510 --> 04:07:54.520 align:start position:0%
play out across the country with over 20
 
04:07:56.189 --> 04:07:56.199 align:start position:0%
states banning
 
04:07:58.950 --> 04:07:58.960 align:start position:0%
abortion this Supreme Court case however
 
04:08:02.070 --> 04:08:02.080 align:start position:0%
is not about a specific State ban
 
04:08:05.510 --> 04:08:05.520 align:start position:0%
instead it would impact all states even
 
04:08:06.630 --> 04:08:06.640 align:start position:0%
here in New
 
04:08:06.640 --> 04:08:08.189 align:start position:0%
here in New
Hampshire

04:08:08.189 --> 04:08:08.199 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
04:08:11.109 --> 04:08:11.119 align:start position:0%
where abortion is legal until 24
 
04:08:13.990 --> 04:08:14.000 align:start position:0%
weeks medication abortion is critical
 
04:08:15.790 --> 04:08:15.800 align:start position:0%
for patients in New Hampshire
 
04:08:18.429 --> 04:08:18.439 align:start position:0%
particularly for constituents in rural
 
04:08:21.229 --> 04:08:21.239 align:start position:0%
areas rural Access to Health Care
 
04:08:23.149 --> 04:08:23.159 align:start position:0%
remains a challenge in all areas of
 
04:08:25.830 --> 04:08:25.840 align:start position:0%
Health Care when it comes to sexual and
 
04:08:27.870 --> 04:08:27.880 align:start position:0%
reproductive Health Care people should
 
04:08:30.149 --> 04:08:30.159 align:start position:0%
be able to get their abortion care in
 
04:08:32.950 --> 04:08:32.960 align:start position:0%
the way that works best for their lives
 
04:08:34.870 --> 04:08:34.880 align:start position:0%
and for many patients medication
 
04:08:37.750 --> 04:08:37.760 align:start position:0%
abortion including mha pistone is what
 
04:08:41.109 --> 04:08:41.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:43.670 --> 04:08:43.680 align:start position:0%
them since the court case came out of
 
04:08:45.309 --> 04:08:45.319 align:start position:0%
Texas and has been taken up by the
 
04:08:47.309 --> 04:08:47.319 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court I've been looking for a
 
04:08:49.229 --> 04:08:49.239 align:start position:0%
way to stand up for our constituents
 
04:08:50.229 --> 04:08:50.239 align:start position:0%
here in New
 
04:08:53.790 --> 04:08:53.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I can't emphasize this enough
 
04:08:56.750 --> 04:08:56.760 align:start position:0%
this case will impact the entire country
 
04:08:59.229 --> 04:08:59.239 align:start position:0%
even in States like ours where abortion
 
04:09:01.870 --> 04:09:01.880 align:start position:0%
is legal the people who brought this
 
04:09:04.550 --> 04:09:04.560 align:start position:0%
case forward have one goal to ban
 
04:09:06.950 --> 04:09:06.960 align:start position:0%
abortion outright and they're using the
 
04:09:09.750 --> 04:09:09.760 align:start position:0%
courts to to try to accomplish this goal
 
04:09:11.469 --> 04:09:11.479 align:start position:0%
just like we saw with the overturning of
 
04:09:12.630 --> 04:09:12.640 align:start position:0%
Row versus
 
04:09:15.269 --> 04:09:15.279 align:start position:0%
Wade and the newest case regarding
 
04:09:17.309 --> 04:09:17.319 align:start position:0%
emergency abortion care when a woman's
 
04:09:20.309 --> 04:09:20.319 align:start position:0%
life is at risk we cannot allow these
 
04:09:23.830 --> 04:09:23.840 align:start position:0%
politically motivated attacks to go
 
04:09:27.630 --> 04:09:27.640 align:start position:0%
unchecked supporting hcr1 is a concrete
 
04:09:29.269 --> 04:09:29.279 align:start position:0%
action the state of New Hampshire can
 
04:09:31.670 --> 04:09:31.680 align:start position:0%
take to show support for medication
 
04:09:35.429 --> 04:09:35.439 align:start position:0%
abortion access mistone is exceptionally
 
04:09:37.830 --> 04:09:37.840 align:start position:0%
safe highly effective and has has been
 
04:09:39.990 --> 04:09:40.000 align:start position:0%
used by more than 5 million people in
 
04:09:42.550 --> 04:09:42.560 align:start position:0%
the United States since the FDA approved
 
04:09:44.269 --> 04:09:44.279 align:start position:0%
it more than 20 years
 
04:09:46.469 --> 04:09:46.479 align:start position:0%
ago with this house concurrent
 
04:09:48.710 --> 04:09:48.720 align:start position:0%
resolution we have a chance to return to
 
04:09:51.550 --> 04:09:51.560 align:start position:0%
Our Roots we can act as our legislature
 
04:09:54.710 --> 04:09:54.720 align:start position:0%
did in 1991 in a bipartisan vote and
 
04:09:56.790 --> 04:09:56.800 align:start position:0%
assure our constituents that we will
 
04:09:59.030 --> 04:09:59.040 align:start position:0%
fight against medically unnecessary
 
04:10:00.990 --> 04:10:01.000 align:start position:0%
restrictions on medication
 
04:10:03.510 --> 04:10:03.520 align:start position:0%
abortion let's do everything we can to
 
04:10:05.550 --> 04:10:05.560 align:start position:0%
ensure that Granite Staters have access
 
04:10:08.590 --> 04:10:08.600 align:start position:0%
to the best possible reprodu healthare
 
04:10:10.870 --> 04:10:10.880 align:start position:0%

the 24 week uh La uh post 24 weeks uh I
 
04:11:58.469 --> 04:11:58.479 align:start position:0%
don't know so I'm asking and you may
 
04:12:03.590 --> 04:12:03.600 align:start position:0%
medicinal abortions uh post 24 weeks
 
04:12:07.670 --> 04:12:07.680 align:start position:0%
um Can can a pregnancy be termin ated
 
04:12:10.670 --> 04:12:10.680 align:start position:0%
after 24 weeks medically I do actually
 
04:12:13.630 --> 04:12:13.640 align:start position:0%
know the answer to that question no so
 
04:12:16.550 --> 04:12:16.560 align:start position:0%
medication abortion can only be used
 
04:12:20.229 --> 04:12:20.239 align:start position:0%
early in pregnancy I I think up until 11
 
04:12:22.790 --> 04:12:22.800 align:start position:0%
weeks you can confirm that number but I
 
04:12:24.910 --> 04:12:24.920 align:start position:0%
don't think it can be used after 11
 
04:12:27.269 --> 04:12:27.279 align:start position:0%
weeks okay that's an important question
 
04:12:30.630 --> 04:12:30.640 align:start position:0%
and and uh that's was kind of my
 
04:12:32.349 --> 04:12:32.359 align:start position:0%
understanding but you can thanks for
 
04:12:35.149 --> 04:12:35.159 align:start position:0%
confirming that and I'm I'm sure others
 
04:12:36.990 --> 04:12:37.000 align:start position:0%
will speak to that as well other
 
04:12:38.510 --> 04:12:38.520 align:start position:0%
question questions for the prime
 
04:12:38.520 --> 04:12:40.109 align:start position:0%
question questions for the prime
representative

04:12:40.109 --> 04:12:40.119 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:12:42.830 --> 04:12:42.840 align:start position:0%
filot thank you for taking my question
 
04:12:45.189 --> 04:12:45.199 align:start position:0%
in the resolution it says that the state
 
04:12:48.269 --> 04:12:48.279 align:start position:0%
will seek to protect and expand access
 
04:12:50.710 --> 04:12:50.720 align:start position:0%
to medication abortion can you explain
 
04:12:53.830 --> 04:12:53.840 align:start position:0%
what it means to expand access to
 
04:12:56.750 --> 04:12:56.760 align:start position:0%
abortion sure thank you for the question
 
04:13:01.750 --> 04:13:01.760 align:start position:0%
so um some of our rural areas have um
 
04:13:04.030 --> 04:13:04.040 align:start position:0%
limited access to reproductive
 
04:13:06.149 --> 04:13:06.159 align:start position:0%
Healthcare across the spectrum of
 
04:13:07.710 --> 04:13:07.720 align:start position:0%
reproductive Healthcare
 
04:13:09.269 --> 04:13:09.279 align:start position:0%
and so
 
04:13:12.630 --> 04:13:12.640 align:start position:0%
um it's just a consistent thing that I I
 
04:13:15.349 --> 04:13:15.359 align:start position:0%
believe that our um we should do as the
 
04:13:17.229 --> 04:13:17.239 align:start position:0%
state is to make sure that everybody has
 
04:13:19.790 --> 04:13:19.800 align:start position:0%
access to health care so I would say
 
04:13:21.990 --> 04:13:22.000 align:start position:0%
access to reproductive health care of
 
04:13:24.630 --> 04:13:24.640 align:start position:0%
which medication abortion is a piece is
 
04:13:26.269 --> 04:13:26.279 align:start position:0%
is important for all of our Granite
 
04:13:26.279 --> 04:13:28.309 align:start position:0%
is important for all of our Granite
Staters

04:13:28.309 --> 04:13:28.319 align:start position:0%
Staters
 
04:13:31.429 --> 04:13:31.439 align:start position:0%
yeah represent levit thank you chair I'm
 
04:13:32.990 --> 04:13:33.000 align:start position:0%
off for taking my
 
04:13:35.030 --> 04:13:35.040 align:start position:0%
question does no other states should
 
04:13:38.870 --> 04:13:38.880 align:start position:0%
have any legislation like this um and
 
04:13:42.149 --> 04:13:42.159 align:start position:0%
process I don't know how other states do
 
04:13:44.830 --> 04:13:44.840 align:start position:0%
um resolutions okay I'm sorry I'm not
 
04:13:46.670 --> 04:13:46.680 align:start position:0%
sure if someone behind me does know that
 
04:13:49.070 --> 04:13:49.080 align:start position:0%
but I I'm unsure of how other states
 
04:13:51.870 --> 04:13:51.880 align:start position:0%
deal with a resolution So currently are
 
04:13:55.189 --> 04:13:55.199 align:start position:0%
there any states that have this law in
 
04:13:57.550 --> 04:13:57.560 align:start position:0%
effect that people are able to take this
 
04:13:57.560 --> 04:13:59.389 align:start position:0%
effect that people are able to take this
medication

04:13:59.389 --> 04:13:59.399 align:start position:0%
medication
 
04:14:03.070 --> 04:14:03.080 align:start position:0%
currently oh so you're not speaking of
 
04:14:04.830 --> 04:14:04.840 align:start position:0%
this so this piece of legislation pull
 
04:14:06.790 --> 04:14:06.800 align:start position:0%
away from that just pull away from that
 
04:14:09.870 --> 04:14:09.880 align:start position:0%
current ly are there and if there are
 
04:14:12.269 --> 04:14:12.279 align:start position:0%
what states if any are
 
04:14:15.950 --> 04:14:15.960 align:start position:0%
currently able to use this
 
04:14:20.590 --> 04:14:20.600 align:start position:0%
medication um every state that allows
 
04:14:23.870 --> 04:14:23.880 align:start position:0%
abortion access early in pregnancy is
 
04:14:26.590 --> 04:14:26.600 align:start position:0%
able to use medication abortion as far
 
04:14:29.830 --> 04:14:29.840 align:start position:0%
as I know I do think we should ask a
 
04:14:32.070 --> 04:14:32.080 align:start position:0%
provider who may be in touch with folks
 
04:14:34.109 --> 04:14:34.119 align:start position:0%
in other states but medication abortion
 
04:14:38.469 --> 04:14:38.479 align:start position:0%
is a very regular way for um folks to
 
04:14:40.750 --> 04:14:40.760 align:start position:0%
receive abortion early in pregnancy so
 
04:14:43.030 --> 04:14:43.040 align:start position:0%
in any state that allows that they would
 
04:14:45.070 --> 04:14:45.080 align:start position:0%
allow okay thank you for that answering
 
04:14:48.830 --> 04:14:48.840 align:start position:0%
that are there any that do not followup
 
04:14:52.630 --> 04:14:52.640 align:start position:0%
chair Moffett followup are there any
 
04:14:56.349 --> 04:14:56.359 align:start position:0%

medical practice in New Hampshire are
 
04:17:41.429 --> 04:17:41.439 align:start position:0%
pushing him to stop offering his
 
04:17:44.030 --> 04:17:44.040 align:start position:0%
Provider Services in New Hampshire and
 
04:17:46.590 --> 04:17:46.600 align:start position:0%
move his clinical practice exclusively

to
 
04:17:50.870 --> 04:17:50.880 align:start position:0%
Vermont he feels that laws regulating
 
04:17:54.149 --> 04:17:54.159 align:start position:0%
abortion care are an unfair intrusion on

national standards of

04:18:06.070 --> 04:18:06.080 align:start position:0%
experience this resolution if passed
 
04:18:09.070 --> 04:18:09.080 align:start position:0%
would provide him an important signal of
 
04:18:11.389 --> 04:18:11.399 align:start position:0%
support that New Hampshire trusts its
 
04:18:14.269 --> 04:18:14.279 align:start position:0%
OBGYN Physicians and values their
 
04:18:15.790 --> 04:18:15.800 align:start position:0%
difficult but meaningful
 
04:18:18.870 --> 04:18:18.880 align:start position:0%
work protecting vital access to abortion
 
04:18:21.070 --> 04:18:21.080 align:start position:0%
medication is an important part of his
 
04:18:23.389 --> 04:18:23.399 align:start position:0%
clinical work and passing this
 
04:18:25.990 --> 04:18:26.000 align:start position:0%
resolution will assure doctors like him
 
04:18:28.229 --> 04:18:28.239 align:start position:0%
that New Hampshire is serious about
 
04:18:31.429 --> 04:18:31.439 align:start position:0%
giving providers all the tools they need
 
04:18:32.990 --> 04:18:33.000 align:start position:0%
to best serve their
 
04:18:35.710 --> 04:18:35.720 align:start position:0%
patients an important moral Victory
 
04:18:38.269 --> 04:18:38.279 align:start position:0%
after these reason attacks on his
 
04:18:40.510 --> 04:18:40.520 align:start position:0%
profession and it will restore
 
04:18:42.309 --> 04:18:42.319 align:start position:0%
confidence in New
 
04:18:45.389 --> 04:18:45.399 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's um Physicians that their
 
04:18:48.349 --> 04:18:48.359 align:start position:0%
legislators are putting people and their
 
04:18:50.389 --> 04:18:50.399 align:start position:0%
health care before
 
04:18:52.830 --> 04:18:52.840 align:start position:0%
politics for that reason I hope you will
 
04:18:55.670 --> 04:18:55.680 align:start position:0%
support this resolution but secondly I'm
 
04:18:58.830 --> 04:18:58.840 align:start position:0%
here personally to express my really
 
04:19:01.269 --> 04:19:01.279 align:start position:0%
just deep disappointment that we even
 
04:19:03.550 --> 04:19:03.560 align:start position:0%
need to expend this kind of collective
 
04:19:07.070 --> 04:19:07.080 align:start position:0%
energy and these resources to ener Ain
 
04:19:09.630 --> 04:19:09.640 align:start position:0%
resolutions like this protecting
 
04:19:11.910 --> 04:19:11.920 align:start position:0%
reproductive health care for women
 
04:19:15.550 --> 04:19:15.560 align:start position:0%
without acknowledging and without naming
 
04:19:17.950 --> 04:19:17.960 align:start position:0%
the true discrimination that pregnant
 
04:19:20.149 --> 04:19:20.159 align:start position:0%
individuals in New Hampshire are facing
 
04:19:22.429 --> 04:19:22.439 align:start position:0%
due to these ongoing political
 
04:19:24.790 --> 04:19:24.800 align:start position:0%
attacks the mere fact that we're not
 
04:19:28.070 --> 04:19:28.080 align:start position:0%
discussing the efficacy and wisdom of
 
04:19:30.189 --> 04:19:30.199 align:start position:0%
condemning medically unnecessary
 
04:19:32.269 --> 04:19:32.279 align:start position:0%
restrictions on Mal's reproductive
 
04:19:34.590 --> 04:19:34.600 align:start position:0%
Health Care decisions and
 
04:19:37.149 --> 04:19:37.159 align:start position:0%
medications which for the record
 
04:19:39.550 --> 04:19:39.560 align:start position:0%
are not nearly as safe or effective as
 
04:19:42.830 --> 04:19:42.840 align:start position:0%
abortion medications demonstrates the
 
04:19:45.790 --> 04:19:45.800 align:start position:0%
true discrimination against an injustice
 
04:19:48.349 --> 04:19:48.359 align:start position:0%
thrust upon women and pregnant people
 
04:19:49.469 --> 04:19:49.479 align:start position:0%
here in New
 
04:19:52.670 --> 04:19:52.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire this is the point that really
 
04:19:54.070 --> 04:19:54.080 align:start position:0%
gets me
 
04:19:56.670 --> 04:19:56.680 align:start position:0%
going attacks on access to women's
 
04:19:58.910 --> 04:19:58.920 align:start position:0%
health care but not Men's Health Care is
 
04:20:01.710 --> 04:20:01.720 align:start position:0%
blatant discrimination on
 
04:20:04.469 --> 04:20:04.479 align:start position:0%
sex based upon sex and it's a
 
04:20:06.189 --> 04:20:06.199 align:start position:0%
substantial government interference into
 
04:20:06.199 --> 04:20:07.550 align:start position:0%
substantial government interference into
Medical

04:20:07.550 --> 04:20:07.560 align:start position:0%
Medical
 
04:20:10.309 --> 04:20:10.319 align:start position:0%
privacy even though I am obviously very
 
04:20:13.550 --> 04:20:13.560 align:start position:0%
upset by this uh and and these recent
 
04:20:16.590 --> 04:20:16.600 align:start position:0%
attacks on my constituent Physicians but
 
04:20:19.870 --> 04:20:19.880 align:start position:0%
also on my body I am dedicated to
 
04:20:21.990 --> 04:20:22.000 align:start position:0%
climbing every proverbial Mountain to
 
04:20:25.750 --> 04:20:25.760 align:start position:0%
support bills like this resolution
 
04:20:28.429 --> 04:20:28.439 align:start position:0%
hcr1 to ensure access to safe and
 
04:20:31.910 --> 04:20:31.920 align:start position:0%
effective medication and
 
04:20:35.670 --> 04:20:35.680 align:start position:0%
um for women's reproductive healthare or
 
04:20:37.790 --> 04:20:37.800 align:start position:0%
you know continue into the future and i'
 
04:20:40.630 --> 04:20:40.640 align:start position:0%
just like to say for those two reasons
 
04:20:42.030 --> 04:20:42.040 align:start position:0%
I'm going to urge this committee to
 
04:20:45.030 --> 04:20:45.040 align:start position:0%
please pass hcr1 thank
 
04:20:48.990 --> 04:20:49.000 align:start position:0%
you thank you representative questions
 
04:20:51.189 --> 04:20:51.199 align:start position:0%
oh would you take questions if there are
 
04:20:53.710 --> 04:20:53.720 align:start position:0%
any Jen if I could just add one more
 
04:20:56.429 --> 04:20:56.439 align:start position:0%
thing um certainly so I have a close
 
04:20:58.670 --> 04:20:58.680 align:start position:0%
relationship with the chair of obst
 
04:21:02.830 --> 04:21:02.840 align:start position:0%
obric and Gynecology at dhmc and I just
 
04:21:05.030 --> 04:21:05.040 align:start position:0%
was recently speaking with her uh last
 
04:21:09.189 --> 04:21:09.199 align:start position:0%
week and um I think that we need to
 
04:21:12.109 --> 04:21:12.119 align:start position:0%
recognize that the current situation in
 
04:21:14.070 --> 04:21:14.080 align:start position:0%
our Marketplace for New Hampshire's
 
04:21:17.149 --> 04:21:17.159 align:start position:0%
women reproductive healthare is quite
 
04:21:19.030 --> 04:21:19.040 align:start position:0%
desperate at the moment there are
 
04:21:20.950 --> 04:21:20.960 align:start position:0%
several members of seniority from that
 
04:21:22.670 --> 04:21:22.680 align:start position:0%
department who have recently retired or
 
04:21:24.710 --> 04:21:24.720 align:start position:0%
left and they're in the middle of a
 
04:21:28.149 --> 04:21:28.159 align:start position:0%
recruitment um wave of young Physicians
 
04:21:31.870 --> 04:21:31.880 align:start position:0%
trying to study the field of practice
 
04:21:31.880 --> 04:21:33.149 align:start position:0%
trying to study the field of practice
that

04:21:33.149 --> 04:21:33.159 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:21:35.910 --> 04:21:35.920 align:start position:0%
they are in and they're having
 
04:21:37.950 --> 04:21:37.960 align:start position:0%
difficulty recruiting top quality
 
04:21:40.830 --> 04:21:40.840 align:start position:0%
candidates to our state as well this is
 
04:21:43.229 --> 04:21:43.239 align:start position:0%
not I'm sorry I'm making a third point I
 
04:21:43.239 --> 04:21:44.070 align:start position:0%
not I'm sorry I'm making a third point I
just

04:21:44.070 --> 04:21:44.080 align:start position:0%
just
 
04:21:46.910 --> 04:21:46.920 align:start position:0%
realized it's not something that is
 
04:21:49.469 --> 04:21:49.479 align:start position:0%
inconsequential and I you know we're
 
04:21:49.479 --> 04:21:51.189 align:start position:0%
inconsequential and I you know we're
losing

04:21:51.189 --> 04:21:51.199 align:start position:0%
losing
 
04:21:54.269 --> 04:21:54.279 align:start position:0%
Trusted Senior members of gynecological
 
04:21:56.950 --> 04:21:56.960 align:start position:0%
services for our state which you know
 
04:21:58.510 --> 04:21:58.520 align:start position:0%
you can count how many there are there's
 
04:22:01.070 --> 04:22:01.080 align:start position:0%
not many departments in the state that
 
04:22:02.149 --> 04:22:02.159 align:start position:0%
offer these
 
04:22:04.750 --> 04:22:04.760 align:start position:0%
services and they're also having trouble
 
04:22:06.550 --> 04:22:06.560 align:start position:0%
recruiting new members to these
 
04:22:09.550 --> 04:22:09.560 align:start position:0%
departments so um I just want you to
 
04:22:11.830 --> 04:22:11.840 align:start position:0%
recognize this is a real problem in real
 
04:22:15.109 --> 04:22:15.119 align:start position:0%
time and that this resolution can go a
 
04:22:17.309 --> 04:22:17.319 align:start position:0%
long way to helping resolve those
 
04:22:21.469 --> 04:22:21.479 align:start position:0%
problems so please please heed the the
 
04:22:23.830 --> 04:22:23.840 align:start position:0%
information I'm sharing with you today
 
04:22:25.670 --> 04:22:25.680 align:start position:0%
and of course I'm happy to answer any
 
04:22:28.189 --> 04:22:28.199 align:start position:0%
questions you mentioned dhmc that's
 
04:22:30.469 --> 04:22:30.479 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical Center yeah
 
04:22:33.389 --> 04:22:33.399 align:start position:0%
okay sort of it's currently called um
 
04:22:35.710 --> 04:22:35.720 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth Health now the larger Network
 
04:22:38.109 --> 04:22:38.119 align:start position:0%
umbrella but dhmc is the specific
 
04:22:41.309 --> 04:22:41.319 align:start position:0%
Lebanon tertiary care system that
 
04:22:45.389 --> 04:22:45.399 align:start position:0%
handles most of these reproductive
 
04:22:48.670 --> 04:22:48.680 align:start position:0%
procedures other
 
04:22:50.469 --> 04:22:50.479 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you

thank you Mr chair and thank you to the
 
04:23:13.109 --> 04:23:13.119 align:start position:0%
committee I'm Katie peternell
 
04:23:15.389 --> 04:23:15.399 align:start position:0%
representative of wol BR in tooro Carrol
 
04:23:18.309 --> 04:23:18.319 align:start position:0%
district 6 I am here in opposition to
 
04:23:25.229 --> 04:23:25.239 align:start position:0%
this bill um this HCR to begin with um
 
04:23:27.429 --> 04:23:27.439 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure when an abortion is truly
 
04:23:29.830 --> 04:23:29.840 align:start position:0%
ever medically necessary it should
 
04:23:32.910 --> 04:23:32.920 align:start position:0%
really only ever be used when a woman's
 
04:23:36.429 --> 04:23:36.439 align:start position:0%
health is in danger and I am actually
 
04:23:38.229 --> 04:23:38.239 align:start position:0%
one of those women and if you would ever
 
04:23:40.750 --> 04:23:40.760 align:start position:0%
care to hear my story I was a patient at
 
04:23:43.630 --> 04:23:43.640 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth Hitchcock and they did save my
 
04:23:45.630 --> 04:23:45.640 align:start position:0%
life but I could tell you a lot about
 
04:23:48.910 --> 04:23:48.920 align:start position:0%
the attitude of the Physicians there um
 
04:23:51.710 --> 04:23:51.720 align:start position:0%
as I go through this HCR um when I get
 
04:23:55.670 --> 04:23:55.680 align:start position:0%
to line six and um they're talking about
 
04:23:57.870 --> 04:23:57.880 align:start position:0%
in 1991 New Hampshire was the first
 
04:24:00.590 --> 04:24:00.600 align:start position:0%
state in the nation to adopt um a
 
04:24:03.469 --> 04:24:03.479 align:start position:0%
resolution encouraging the use the
 
04:24:06.309 --> 04:24:06.319 align:start position:0%
clinical trials of myth prisone but I
 
04:24:07.830 --> 04:24:07.840 align:start position:0%
really don't see that that's anything
 
04:24:09.429 --> 04:24:09.439 align:start position:0%
that the state of New Hampshire has to
 
04:24:13.830 --> 04:24:13.840 align:start position:0%
be proud of um the next line line 10 or
 
04:24:17.229 --> 04:24:17.239 align:start position:0%
down in line 10 there's a statement that
 
04:24:19.830 --> 04:24:19.840 align:start position:0%
um accessing abortion is Central to
 
04:24:23.070 --> 04:24:23.080 align:start position:0%
people's ability to participate equally
 
04:24:26.710 --> 04:24:26.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:29.910 --> 04:24:29.920 align:start position:0%
life I'm not sure what equally means in
 
04:24:32.830 --> 04:24:32.840 align:start position:0%
this sentence because I'm pretty sure
 
04:24:35.550 --> 04:24:35.560 align:start position:0%
men aren't able to have babies so if we
 
04:24:37.550 --> 04:24:37.560 align:start position:0%
were truly equal then that would mean
 
04:24:39.429 --> 04:24:39.439 align:start position:0%
that men would also be allowed to have
 
04:24:40.790 --> 04:24:40.800 align:start position:0%
babies and then they would have to make
 
04:24:43.149 --> 04:24:43.159 align:start position:0%
a decision about how they were going to
 
04:24:45.630 --> 04:24:45.640 align:start position:0%
participate equally in economic and
 
04:24:45.640 --> 04:24:47.870 align:start position:0%
participate equally in economic and
social

04:24:47.870 --> 04:24:47.880 align:start position:0%
social
 
04:24:52.710 --> 04:24:52.720 align:start position:0%
life as we go down to line
 
04:24:58.590 --> 04:24:58.600 align:start position:0%
27 um more than 4 million 4
 
04:25:01.070 --> 04:25:01.080 align:start position:0%
million that's a pretty big number we
 
04:25:03.309 --> 04:25:03.319 align:start position:0%
have uh commissioned to study um
 
04:25:05.030 --> 04:25:05.040 align:start position:0%
genocide and the Holocaust in our
 
04:25:07.590 --> 04:25:07.600 align:start position:0%
committee so I'll just let you stew on
 
04:25:09.870 --> 04:25:09.880 align:start position:0%
that four million number but four
 
04:25:11.550 --> 04:25:11.560 align:start position:0%
million women in the country have used
 
04:25:13.389 --> 04:25:13.399 align:start position:0%
Mis for pry Stone to Ender pregnancy
 
04:25:13.399 --> 04:25:14.269 align:start position:0%
Mis for pry Stone to Ender pregnancy
since

04:25:14.269 --> 04:25:14.279 align:start position:0%
since
 
04:25:17.670 --> 04:25:17.680 align:start position:0%
200000 if you do some calculations based
 
04:25:19.710 --> 04:25:19.720 align:start position:0%
on the population of New Hampshire that
 
04:25:22.670 --> 04:25:22.680 align:start position:0%
means since 2000 about since the year
 
04:25:25.030 --> 04:25:25.040 align:start position:0%
2000 about
 
04:25:28.750 --> 04:25:28.760 align:start position:0%
12,000 women have had abortions in our
 
04:25:32.990 --> 04:25:33.000 align:start position:0%
state maybe some are repeat whatever to
 
04:25:35.070 --> 04:25:35.080 align:start position:0%
take the rough
 
04:25:35.080 --> 04:25:36.670 align:start position:0%
take the rough
figures

04:25:36.670 --> 04:25:36.680 align:start position:0%
figures
 
04:25:42.109 --> 04:25:42.119 align:start position:0%
so now I fully realize that no one ever
 
04:25:45.189 --> 04:25:45.199 align:start position:0%
wants to have an abortion they don't
 
04:25:47.670 --> 04:25:47.680 align:start position:0%
make this decision lightly but I think
 
04:25:50.070 --> 04:25:50.080 align:start position:0%
that we can do the women in our state a
 
04:25:52.910 --> 04:25:52.920 align:start position:0%
much better job if you just think about
 
04:25:54.750 --> 04:25:54.760 align:start position:0%
the statistics of the numbers of
 
04:25:57.030 --> 04:25:57.040 align:start position:0%
abortions that have occurred in our
 
04:25:58.990 --> 04:25:59.000 align:start position:0%
state and of course we don't have the
 
04:26:00.550 --> 04:26:00.560 align:start position:0%
actual statistics so I have to
 
04:26:04.870 --> 04:26:04.880 align:start position:0%
extrapolate that from National Data but
 
04:26:06.670 --> 04:26:06.680 align:start position:0%
that that's a huge number and we talk
 
04:26:09.229 --> 04:26:09.239 align:start position:0%
all the time about the increasing age of
 
04:26:11.630 --> 04:26:11.640 align:start position:0%
our population declining School
 
04:26:14.790 --> 04:26:14.800 align:start position:0%
enrollment decreasing Workforce across
 
04:26:17.309 --> 04:26:17.319 align:start position:0%
various sectors of the state I think
 
04:26:18.830 --> 04:26:18.840 align:start position:0%
that New Hampshire has a compelling
 
04:26:22.630 --> 04:26:22.640 align:start position:0%
State interest to not pass this HCR and
 
04:26:25.469 --> 04:26:25.479 align:start position:0%
instead encourage women to do the most
 
04:26:29.349 --> 04:26:29.359 align:start position:0%
important job that only women can do
 
04:26:29.359 --> 04:26:30.830 align:start position:0%
important job that only women can do
thank

04:26:30.830 --> 04:26:30.840 align:start position:0%
thank
 
04:26:33.469 --> 04:26:33.479 align:start position:0%
you would you take
 
04:26:35.750 --> 04:26:35.760 align:start position:0%
questions I'll try to answer whatever I
 
04:26:35.760 --> 04:26:36.750 align:start position:0%
questions I'll try to answer whatever I
can

04:26:36.750 --> 04:26:36.760 align:start position:0%
can
 
04:26:39.510 --> 04:26:39.520 align:start position:0%
I see hand representative finny thank
 
04:26:42.070 --> 04:26:42.080 align:start position:0%
you I just have one question um do you
 
04:26:43.950 --> 04:26:43.960 align:start position:0%
believe it is the role of the state to
 
04:26:47.710 --> 04:26:47.720 align:start position:0%
to legislate human uh
 
04:26:49.910 --> 04:26:49.920 align:start position:0%
reproduction like like should the state
 
04:26:51.950 --> 04:26:51.960 align:start position:0%
force people to give birth against their
 
04:26:55.109 --> 04:26:55.119 align:start position:0%
will I actually
 
04:26:57.670 --> 04:26:57.680 align:start position:0%
don't I think this is a slippery slope
 
04:27:01.070 --> 04:27:01.080 align:start position:0%
quite honestly
 
04:27:04.670 --> 04:27:04.680 align:start position:0%
because the more we encourage this
 
04:27:07.229 --> 04:27:07.239 align:start position:0%
reproductive right which is really the
 
04:27:11.269 --> 04:27:11.279 align:start position:0%
right to not reproduce I think the state
 
04:27:13.269 --> 04:27:13.279 align:start position:0%
might take the opposite stance and start
 
04:27:15.950 --> 04:27:15.960 align:start position:0%
telling people that they should not have
 
04:27:18.309 --> 04:27:18.319 align:start position:0%
children that their babies aren't worth
 
04:27:21.510 --> 04:27:21.520 align:start position:0%
it that their job is better
 
04:27:24.070 --> 04:27:24.080 align:start position:0%
off in a f working in a factory or
 
04:27:25.550 --> 04:27:25.560 align:start position:0%
something somewhere I think it's a
 
04:27:25.560 --> 04:27:29.109 align:start position:0%
something somewhere I think it's a
slippery

04:27:29.109 --> 04:27:29.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:32.269 --> 04:27:32.279 align:start position:0%
slope other
 
04:27:34.870 --> 04:27:34.880 align:start position:0%
questions representative levit thank you
 
04:27:36.910 --> 04:27:36.920 align:start position:0%
chair m
 
04:27:40.030 --> 04:27:40.040 align:start position:0%
so these numbers are pretty big
 
04:27:44.630 --> 04:27:44.640 align:start position:0%
numbers so this medication is being used
 
04:27:44.640 --> 04:27:45.590 align:start position:0%
numbers so this medication is being used
rather

04:27:45.590 --> 04:27:45.600 align:start position:0%
rather
 
04:27:49.189 --> 04:27:49.199 align:start position:0%
frequently do you have an idea of some
 
04:27:51.309 --> 04:27:51.319 align:start position:0%
of the states that are using this more
 
04:27:54.910 --> 04:27:54.920 align:start position:0%
than others and a follow-up question do
 
04:27:57.630 --> 04:27:57.640 align:start position:0%
you think that
 
04:27:59.910 --> 04:27:59.920 align:start position:0%
um the bordering
 
04:28:03.510 --> 04:28:03.520 align:start position:0%
states that have this is something that
 
04:28:04.510 --> 04:28:04.520 align:start position:0%
could be
 
04:28:09.870 --> 04:28:09.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:12.590 --> 04:28:12.600 align:start position:0%
you first of all I don't know what other
 
04:28:17.590 --> 04:28:17.600 align:start position:0%
states are doing in terms of mistone
 
04:28:20.790 --> 04:28:20.800 align:start position:0%
prescriptions I guess my answer back
 
04:28:20.800 --> 04:28:21.510 align:start position:0%
prescriptions I guess my answer back
would

04:28:21.510 --> 04:28:21.520 align:start position:0%
would
 
04:28:24.590 --> 04:28:24.600 align:start position:0%
be do we want to be known as the live
 
04:28:27.109 --> 04:28:27.119 align:start position:0%
for your die State or the come here to
 
04:28:27.119 --> 04:28:34.790 align:start position:0%
for your die State or the come here to
die

04:28:34.790 --> 04:28:34.800 align:start position:0%

04:28:36.790 --> 04:28:36.800 align:start position:0%
state
 
04:28:36.800 --> 04:28:40.070 align:start position:0%
state
other

04:28:40.070 --> 04:28:40.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:42.109 --> 04:28:42.119 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you
 
04:28:48.510 --> 04:28:48.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:51.349 --> 04:28:51.359 align:start position:0%
much okay I have two names in this card
 
04:28:56.309 --> 04:28:56.319 align:start position:0%
uh Caleb Montgomery and Liz Canada
 
04:28:58.910 --> 04:28:58.920 align:start position:0%
um I interpret that as meaning you wish
 
04:29:02.149 --> 04:29:02.159 align:start position:0%
to uh testify in tandem looks that way
 
04:29:05.030 --> 04:29:05.040 align:start position:0%
okay and uh you have written testimony
 
04:29:06.750 --> 04:29:06.760 align:start position:0%
has that been passed
 
04:29:13.790 --> 04:29:13.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:15.870 --> 04:29:15.880 align:start position:0%
submitted the opposite because it's red
 
04:29:19.189 --> 04:29:19.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:23.469 --> 04:29:23.479 align:start position:0%
confusing right um thank you H and yes
 
04:29:26.349 --> 04:29:26.359 align:start position:0%
we're gonna be um testifying together if
 
04:29:28.990 --> 04:29:29.000 align:start position:0%
if that works for everyone um my name is
 
04:29:30.429 --> 04:29:30.439 align:start position:0%
Kayla Montgomery I'm the vice president
 
04:29:32.149 --> 04:29:32.159 align:start position:0%
of public affairs for Planned Parenthood
 
04:29:33.790 --> 04:29:33.800 align:start position:0%
of Northern New England and Planned
 
04:29:35.790 --> 04:29:35.800 align:start position:0%
Parenthood New Hampshire action fund um
 
04:29:37.149 --> 04:29:37.159 align:start position:0%
um so I'm just going to talk a little
 
04:29:40.670 --> 04:29:40.680 align:start position:0%
bit about Healthcare and the way that um
 
04:29:42.550 --> 04:29:42.560 align:start position:0%
medication abortion is delivered here in
 
04:29:44.229 --> 04:29:44.239 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire um and then I'm going to
 
04:29:45.389 --> 04:29:45.399 align:start position:0%
turn over to my colleague Liz who's
 
04:29:46.349 --> 04:29:46.359 align:start position:0%
going to talk a little bit more about
 
04:29:48.870 --> 04:29:48.880 align:start position:0%
the legal landscape in this country so
 
04:29:51.269 --> 04:29:51.279 align:start position:0%
that is why we um are testifying
 
04:29:54.070 --> 04:29:54.080 align:start position:0%
together um and I will just say as a
 
04:29:56.229 --> 04:29:56.239 align:start position:0%
quick note I have been a lobbyist in the
 
04:29:58.389 --> 04:29:58.399 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire for 14 years and
 
04:29:59.990 --> 04:30:00.000 align:start position:0%
I have never once been before this
 
04:30:02.030 --> 04:30:02.040 align:start position:0%
committee so this is very exciting for
 
04:30:03.630 --> 04:30:03.640 align:start position:0%
me thank you for having us it's
 
04:30:08.030 --> 04:30:08.040 align:start position:0%
wonderful to be here um okay so um we
 
04:30:10.189 --> 04:30:10.199 align:start position:0%
are here in support of this um
 
04:30:11.990 --> 04:30:12.000 align:start position:0%
resolution so medication
 
04:30:14.790 --> 04:30:14.800 align:start position:0%
abortion also known as the abortion pill
 
04:30:17.189 --> 04:30:17.199 align:start position:0%
it is a safe and effective way to end an
 
04:30:19.590 --> 04:30:19.600 align:start position:0%
early pregnancy so when we say early
 
04:30:22.429 --> 04:30:22.439 align:start position:0%
pregnancy that's up to 11 weeks or
 
04:30:26.550 --> 04:30:26.560 align:start position:0%
another way to say that is 77 days after
 
04:30:28.750 --> 04:30:28.760 align:start position:0%
the first date of your last Miss period
 
04:30:32.389 --> 04:30:32.399 align:start position:0%
77 days if you are 78 days you are not
 
04:30:34.189 --> 04:30:34.199 align:start position:0%
eligible for medication abortion at
 
04:30:37.109 --> 04:30:37.119 align:start position:0%
Planned Parenthood so serious
 
04:30:39.630 --> 04:30:39.640 align:start position:0%
complications they happen in less than
 
04:30:42.510 --> 04:30:42.520 align:start position:0%
onethird of 1% of cases medication
 
04:30:46.870 --> 04:30:46.880 align:start position:0%
abortion is in fact um safer than common
 
04:30:49.309 --> 04:30:49.319 align:start position:0%
uh medicines like penicillin and
 
04:30:51.670 --> 04:30:51.680 align:start position:0%
Viagra at plan parent of Northern New
 
04:30:53.670 --> 04:30:53.680 align:start position:0%
England we provide medication abortion
 
04:30:55.349 --> 04:30:55.359 align:start position:0%
at three out of four of our health
 
04:30:57.870 --> 04:30:57.880 align:start position:0%
centers Manchester and keen and as of
 
04:31:00.750 --> 04:31:00.760 align:start position:0%
last month in Dairy as well so it is
 
04:31:02.830 --> 04:31:02.840 align:start position:0%
also an option for some patients via
 
04:31:05.030 --> 04:31:05.040 align:start position:0%
tella Health with our trained and uh
 
04:31:05.040 --> 04:31:06.189 align:start position:0%
tella Health with our trained and uh
licensed

04:31:06.189 --> 04:31:06.199 align:start position:0%
licensed
 
04:31:09.870 --> 04:31:09.880 align:start position:0%
clinicians now we say abortion pill but
 
04:31:12.590 --> 04:31:12.600 align:start position:0%
it's actually a series of five pills
 
04:31:15.469 --> 04:31:15.479 align:start position:0%
using two different drugs so the first
 
04:31:18.030 --> 04:31:18.040 align:start position:0%
one is called myph aistone that is the
 
04:31:20.750 --> 04:31:20.760 align:start position:0%
subject of today's uh resolution the
 
04:31:22.950 --> 04:31:22.960 align:start position:0%
second one is called misoprostol so the
 
04:31:25.149 --> 04:31:25.159 align:start position:0%
first one the patient will take one
 
04:31:27.870 --> 04:31:27.880 align:start position:0%
mistone and that is the drug that blocks
 
04:31:30.349 --> 04:31:30.359 align:start position:0%
progesterone and that is a hormone that
 
04:31:31.670 --> 04:31:31.680 align:start position:0%
is needed for
 
04:31:34.349 --> 04:31:34.359 align:start position:0%
pregnancy and then the patient after
 
04:31:36.870 --> 04:31:36.880 align:start position:0%
that take the first pill they then take
 
04:31:39.790 --> 04:31:39.800 align:start position:0%
four misool pills they can insert them
 
04:31:41.910 --> 04:31:41.920 align:start position:0%
in their cheek and let them dissolve and
 
04:31:43.790 --> 04:31:43.800 align:start position:0%
that is the drug that empties the
 
04:31:45.790 --> 04:31:45.800 align:start position:0%
contents of the uterus so this
 
04:31:48.990 --> 04:31:49.000 align:start position:0%
combination this five pill two drug uh
 
04:31:51.710 --> 04:31:51.720 align:start position:0%
combination is standard medication
 
04:31:51.720 --> 04:31:53.750 align:start position:0%
combination is standard medication
abortion

04:31:53.750 --> 04:31:53.760 align:start position:0%
abortion
 
04:31:56.189 --> 04:31:56.199 align:start position:0%
protocol and we treat medication
 
04:31:57.710 --> 04:31:57.720 align:start position:0%
abortion the same way that we would
 
04:31:59.990 --> 04:32:00.000 align:start position:0%
treat a procedural abortion so the
 
04:32:01.990 --> 04:32:02.000 align:start position:0%
intake procedures the counseling
 
04:32:04.349 --> 04:32:04.359 align:start position:0%
procedures those are all the same the
 
04:32:06.950 --> 04:32:06.960 align:start position:0%
difference is that medic abortion the
 
04:32:09.309 --> 04:32:09.319 align:start position:0%
actual abortion happens in a person's
 
04:32:11.750 --> 04:32:11.760 align:start position:0%
home whereas in procedural abortion it
 
04:32:13.670 --> 04:32:13.680 align:start position:0%
happens in our health
 
04:32:15.950 --> 04:32:15.960 align:start position:0%
centers and this fact has been stated
 
04:32:18.510 --> 04:32:18.520 align:start position:0%
but one um over five million people in
 
04:32:20.750 --> 04:32:20.760 align:start position:0%
the United States have used mistone
 
04:32:24.510 --> 04:32:24.520 align:start position:0%
which has been FDA approved for 20 years
 
04:32:27.469 --> 04:32:27.479 align:start position:0%
now many patients will choose medication
 
04:32:30.510 --> 04:32:30.520 align:start position:0%
abortion um nationally that number is
 
04:32:33.910 --> 04:32:33.920 align:start position:0%
about 50% but here um at Planned
 
04:32:35.830 --> 04:32:35.840 align:start position:0%
Parenthood of Northern New England that
 
04:32:39.030 --> 04:32:39.040 align:start position:0%
numberers much higher about 70% of
 
04:32:41.149 --> 04:32:41.159 align:start position:0%
patients who are seeking abortion choose
 
04:32:43.429 --> 04:32:43.439 align:start position:0%
medication abortion and they choose
 
04:32:45.510 --> 04:32:45.520 align:start position:0%
medication abortion over a procedural
 
04:32:48.269 --> 04:32:48.279 align:start position:0%
abortion for a number of reasons uh most
 
04:32:51.429 --> 04:32:51.439 align:start position:0%
commonly uh because patients want to be
 
04:32:53.229 --> 04:32:53.239 align:start position:0%
in the comfort of their own home on
 
04:32:55.189 --> 04:32:55.199 align:start position:0%
their own schedules some people feel
 
04:32:57.750 --> 04:32:57.760 align:start position:0%
it's less invasive but it is not for
 
04:33:00.070 --> 04:33:00.080 align:start position:0%
everyone it's a personal choice and that
 
04:33:02.790 --> 04:33:02.800 align:start position:0%
is why of course we offer both uh
 
04:33:04.070 --> 04:33:04.080 align:start position:0%
options at Planned
 
04:33:06.830 --> 04:33:06.840 align:start position:0%
Parenthood and it is also important to
 
04:33:09.510 --> 04:33:09.520 align:start position:0%
note that medication abortion and
 
04:33:11.949 --> 04:33:11.959 align:start position:0%
emergency contraception are not the same
 
04:33:14.310 --> 04:33:14.320 align:start position:0%
thing so medication abortion again the
 
04:33:16.990 --> 04:33:17.000 align:start position:0%
subject of today's resolution is taken
 
04:33:19.551 --> 04:33:19.561 align:start position:0%
to safely end a pregnancy whereas
 
04:33:21.949 --> 04:33:21.959 align:start position:0%
emergency contraception is one pill and
 
04:33:23.910 --> 04:33:23.920 align:start position:0%
it's available over the counter and it's
 
04:33:26.310 --> 04:33:26.320 align:start position:0%
taken after unprotected sex occurs to
 
04:33:27.709 --> 04:33:27.719 align:start position:0%
make sure that a pregnancy doesn't
 
04:33:30.551 --> 04:33:30.561 align:start position:0%
happen not the same thing emergency
 
04:33:32.230 --> 04:33:32.240 align:start position:0%
contraception will not end a
 
04:33:34.551 --> 04:33:34.561 align:start position:0%
pregnancy and um it was mentioned by the
 
04:33:36.590 --> 04:33:36.600 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor but I I think it's also worth
 
04:33:38.670 --> 04:33:38.680 align:start position:0%
um bringing up again that New Hampshire
 
04:33:40.189 --> 04:33:40.199 align:start position:0%
was indeed the first state in the nation
 
04:33:43.109 --> 04:33:43.119 align:start position:0%
to adopt a resolution urging the FDA to
 
04:33:45.551 --> 04:33:45.561 align:start position:0%
allow clinical trials of mea prone and
 
04:33:47.709 --> 04:33:47.719 align:start position:0%
medication abortion back in 1991 so we
 
04:33:50.230 --> 04:33:50.240 align:start position:0%
have a long proud history and um I'm
 
04:33:52.070 --> 04:33:52.080 align:start position:0%
happy to take any questions if not I
 
04:33:57.869 --> 04:33:57.879 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:00.949 --> 04:34:00.959 align:start position:0%
Liz great that sounds wonderful so hi
 
04:34:02.750 --> 04:34:02.760 align:start position:0%
everyone my name is Liz Canada I'm the
 
04:34:04.551 --> 04:34:04.561 align:start position:0%
advocacy director at plan Parenthood New
 
04:34:06.189 --> 04:34:06.199 align:start position:0%
Hampshire action fund and Planned
 
04:34:08.310 --> 04:34:08.320 align:start position:0%
Parenthood of Northern New England so as
 
04:34:11.150 --> 04:34:11.160 align:start position:0%
Kayla talked about um the subject of
 
04:34:13.750 --> 04:34:13.760 align:start position:0%
this uh house concurrent resolution is
 
04:34:15.429 --> 04:34:15.439 align:start position:0%
medication abortion but specifically
 
04:34:17.830 --> 04:34:17.840 align:start position:0%
mtha prisone which is the first pill
 
04:34:20.310 --> 04:34:20.320 align:start position:0%
because right now the US Supreme Court
 
04:34:22.789 --> 04:34:22.799 align:start position:0%
has taken up a case related to myher
 
04:34:35.269 --> 04:34:35.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:39.349 --> 04:34:39.359 align:start position:0%
sued the FDA over its approval of myph
 
04:34:42.670 --> 04:34:42.680 align:start position:0%
aistone now the case uses junk science
 
04:34:45.029 --> 04:34:45.039 align:start position:0%
to allege that mistone was wrongly
 
04:34:48.269 --> 04:34:48.279 align:start position:0%
approved by the FDA 22 years ago and
 
04:34:50.910 --> 04:34:50.920 align:start position:0%
it's seeking to remove
 
04:34:54.470 --> 04:34:54.480 align:start position:0%
mistone from the shelves entirely so
 
04:34:55.590 --> 04:34:55.600 align:start position:0%
that would impact I've heard the
 
04:34:57.070 --> 04:34:57.080 align:start position:0%
question come up of what states are able
 
04:35:00.349 --> 04:35:00.359 align:start position:0%
to use it this case would impact every
 
04:35:02.109 --> 04:35:02.119 align:start position:0%
state in the country including in New
 
04:35:05.269 --> 04:35:05.279 align:start position:0%
Hampshire where abortion is legal until
 
04:35:05.279 --> 04:35:07.189 align:start position:0%
Hampshire where abortion is legal until
24

04:35:07.189 --> 04:35:07.199 align:start position:0%
24
 
04:35:10.390 --> 04:35:10.400 align:start position:0%
weeks and not just in in New Hampshire
 
04:35:12.789 --> 04:35:12.799 align:start position:0%
but also in states that have passed
 
04:35:14.349 --> 04:35:14.359 align:start position:0%
Constitutional Amendments they've
 
04:35:16.590 --> 04:35:16.600 align:start position:0%
amended their constitution to protect
 
04:35:19.349 --> 04:35:19.359 align:start position:0%
abortion like our neighbors in Vermont
 
04:35:21.470 --> 04:35:21.480 align:start position:0%
it would affect them as well the outcome
 
04:35:25.551 --> 04:35:25.561 align:start position:0%
of this case so the purpose the reason
 
04:35:27.189 --> 04:35:27.199 align:start position:0%
why these folks have brought this case
 
04:35:31.390 --> 04:35:31.400 align:start position:0%
is to try to pass a deao um abortion ban
 
04:35:33.510 --> 04:35:33.520 align:start position:0%
Nationwide they're using this as a
 
04:35:37.551 --> 04:35:37.561 align:start position:0%
mechanism to take One Way um one method
 
04:35:40.510 --> 04:35:40.520 align:start position:0%
of abortion Out Of Reach for patients
 
04:35:41.551 --> 04:35:41.561 align:start position:0%
this is what they are trying to do
 
04:35:42.990 --> 04:35:43.000 align:start position:0%
through this through this case
 
04:35:45.150 --> 04:35:45.160 align:start position:0%
specifically so this is an outrageous
 
04:35:47.789 --> 04:35:47.799 align:start position:0%
attack it's politically motivated it's
 
04:35:49.990 --> 04:35:50.000 align:start position:0%
instigated and funded by extreme
 
04:35:52.470 --> 04:35:52.480 align:start position:0%
anti-abortion actors because they are
 
04:35:54.551 --> 04:35:54.561 align:start position:0%
trying to ban abortion they're trying to
 
04:35:56.510 --> 04:35:56.520 align:start position:0%
restrict even birth control and so forth
 
04:35:58.949 --> 04:35:58.959 align:start position:0%
and they're using the courts to do
 
04:36:02.629 --> 04:36:02.639 align:start position:0%
so now that we are expecting this ruling
 
04:36:04.551 --> 04:36:04.561 align:start position:0%
from the US Supreme Court to happen
 
04:36:06.590 --> 04:36:06.600 align:start position:0%
probably in June similar to what we saw
 
04:36:09.150 --> 04:36:09.160 align:start position:0%
when they overturned roie Wade in 2022
 
04:36:11.310 --> 04:36:11.320 align:start position:0%
we saw that outcome uh at the end of
 
04:36:14.629 --> 04:36:14.639 align:start position:0%
June and since that decision came out
 
04:36:16.551 --> 04:36:16.561 align:start position:0%
over 20 states have banned abortion
 
04:36:18.709 --> 04:36:18.719 align:start position:0%
outright so in those States and I heard
 
04:36:20.230 --> 04:36:20.240 align:start position:0%
the prime sponsor say this but I want to
 
04:36:22.910 --> 04:36:22.920 align:start position:0%
just reiterate in states where abortion
 
04:36:26.150 --> 04:36:26.160 align:start position:0%
is banned patients cannot access mistone
 
04:36:27.990 --> 04:36:28.000 align:start position:0%
that is not allowed because it is banned
 
04:36:31.230 --> 04:36:31.240 align:start position:0%
in their states here in New Hampshire
 
04:36:33.429 --> 04:36:33.439 align:start position:0%
abortion is safe and legal up to 24
 
04:36:34.629 --> 04:36:34.639 align:start position:0%
weeks and then we know that there are
 
04:36:37.709 --> 04:36:37.719 align:start position:0%
exceptions after 24 weeks as well but
 
04:36:41.670 --> 04:36:41.680 align:start position:0%
mistone is only uh used up till the 11th
 
04:36:43.949 --> 04:36:43.959 align:start position:0%
week and so this case would impact New
 
04:36:47.551 --> 04:36:47.561 align:start position:0%
Hampshire where we have a law um that's
 
04:36:49.230 --> 04:36:49.240 align:start position:0%
affecting abortion later in pregnancy
 
04:36:51.349 --> 04:36:51.359 align:start position:0%
this is about abortion earlier in
 
04:36:53.990 --> 04:36:54.000 align:start position:0%
pregnancy so we would really urge you to
 
04:36:57.830 --> 04:36:57.840 align:start position:0%
pass this resolution and you know let
 
04:37:00.349 --> 04:37:00.359 align:start position:0%
the uh Federal delegation know you know
 
04:37:01.949 --> 04:37:01.959 align:start position:0%
send that message from New Hampshire
 
04:37:04.349 --> 04:37:04.359 align:start position:0%
just as the legislature did in 1991 of
 
04:37:05.670 --> 04:37:05.680 align:start position:0%
what your commit
 
04:37:07.869 --> 04:37:07.879 align:start position:0%
to abortion earlier in pregnancy up to
 
04:37:10.230 --> 04:37:10.240 align:start position:0%
11 weeks and so now I know that there
 
04:37:12.349 --> 04:37:12.359 align:start position:0%
are questions but I'll I'll stop there
 
04:37:12.359 --> 04:37:14.070 align:start position:0%
are questions but I'll I'll stop there
thank

04:37:14.070 --> 04:37:14.080 align:start position:0%
thank
 
04:37:17.230 --> 04:37:17.240 align:start position:0%
you you know there were questions okay
 
04:37:19.949 --> 04:37:19.959 align:start position:0%
uh yes you're right there's a question
 
04:37:21.269 --> 04:37:21.279 align:start position:0%
right there from representative fin I
 
04:37:23.750 --> 04:37:23.760 align:start position:0%
have two questions if that's okay my
 
04:37:25.470 --> 04:37:25.480 align:start position:0%
first question is it is it the position
 
04:37:27.910 --> 04:37:27.920 align:start position:0%
of Planned Parenthood to only offer
 
04:37:30.869 --> 04:37:30.879 align:start position:0%
abortion or or you know do you ever
 
04:37:33.390 --> 04:37:33.400 align:start position:0%
encourage a woman to to to carry a
 
04:37:36.629 --> 04:37:36.639 align:start position:0%
pregnancy to term
 
04:37:40.590 --> 04:37:40.600 align:start position:0%
so um plan Parenthood along with
 
04:37:43.949 --> 04:37:43.959 align:start position:0%
um family planning providers um all have
 
04:37:47.150 --> 04:37:47.160 align:start position:0%
a very uh serious uh intake procedure
 
04:37:50.551 --> 04:37:50.561 align:start position:0%
that includes counseling it is um by law
 
04:37:53.150 --> 04:37:53.160 align:start position:0%
but also it is medically accurate and so
 
04:37:56.310 --> 04:37:56.320 align:start position:0%
all um patients who come in who do for
 
04:37:58.109 --> 04:37:58.119 align:start position:0%
an abortion whether it's a medication
 
04:38:00.629 --> 04:38:00.639 align:start position:0%
abortion or whether it is a procedural
 
04:38:02.629 --> 04:38:02.639 align:start position:0%
abortion whether it is via tella health
 
04:38:04.109 --> 04:38:04.119 align:start position:0%
or whether it is in the health center
 
04:38:06.869 --> 04:38:06.879 align:start position:0%
there is a a counseling procedure that
 
04:38:08.910 --> 04:38:08.920 align:start position:0%
is discussed and all options of what to
 
04:38:10.830 --> 04:38:10.840 align:start position:0%
do with a pregnancy are discussed at
 
04:38:13.390 --> 04:38:13.400 align:start position:0%
that counseling okay my other question
 
04:38:15.070 --> 04:38:15.080 align:start position:0%
is I and I really need an answer to this
 
04:38:16.510 --> 04:38:16.520 align:start position:0%
from from everybody who's going to
 
04:38:18.869 --> 04:38:18.879 align:start position:0%
testify do do you believe it is the role
 
04:38:22.590 --> 04:38:22.600 align:start position:0%
of the state to legislate human
 
04:38:26.910 --> 04:38:26.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:32.029 --> 04:38:32.039 align:start position:0%
you representative levit thank you chair
 
04:38:37.070 --> 04:38:37.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:43.189 --> 04:38:43.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:45.349 --> 04:38:45.359 align:start position:0%
legislation by this
 
04:38:48.310 --> 04:38:48.320 align:start position:0%
house would be subject to the
 
04:38:52.189 --> 04:38:52.199 align:start position:0%
outcome of the let the litigation in the
 
04:38:54.910 --> 04:38:54.920 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court I mean it's Common
 
04:38:59.670 --> 04:38:59.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:01.709 --> 04:39:01.719 align:start position:0%
that thank you for the question I think
 
04:39:04.310 --> 04:39:04.320 align:start position:0%
I understand the question so the outcome
 
04:39:07.109 --> 04:39:07.119 align:start position:0%
of this US Supreme Court case will
 
04:39:09.789 --> 04:39:09.799 align:start position:0%
impact New Hampshire so uh the lower
 
04:39:14.551 --> 04:39:14.561 align:start position:0%
court um has ruled that medication
 
04:39:17.150 --> 04:39:17.160 align:start position:0%
abortion MTH aistone the the FDA
 
04:39:19.789 --> 04:39:19.799 align:start position:0%
approval process should be rolled back
 
04:39:21.830 --> 04:39:21.840 align:start position:0%
that myth aistone should be more
 
04:39:24.070 --> 04:39:24.080 align:start position:0%
restricted so right now it's up to 11
 
04:39:26.109 --> 04:39:26.119 align:start position:0%
weeks that it's available one of the
 
04:39:27.590 --> 04:39:27.600 align:start position:0%
decisions from the lower court is that
 
04:39:29.150 --> 04:39:29.160 align:start position:0%
it should only be available until the
 
04:39:31.150 --> 04:39:31.160 align:start position:0%
sixth week so that would mean that
 
04:39:33.510 --> 04:39:33.520 align:start position:0%
patients seeking abortion after 6 weeks
 
04:39:36.029 --> 04:39:36.039 align:start position:0%
before our ban of 24 weeks would not
 
04:39:38.230 --> 04:39:38.240 align:start position:0%
have myth ayone available to them so yes
 
04:39:41.470 --> 04:39:41.480 align:start position:0%
it would impact but this is not changing
 
04:39:44.230 --> 04:39:44.240 align:start position:0%
state law and the 1991 resolution was
 
04:39:47.670 --> 04:39:47.680 align:start position:0%
also not a state law this is uh the FDA
 
04:39:50.030 --> 04:39:50.040 align:start position:0%
approval process so it would impact uh
 
04:39:52.190 --> 04:39:52.200 align:start position:0%
Nationwide um the availability of myth
 
04:39:52.200 --> 04:39:54.150 align:start position:0%
Nationwide um the availability of myth
of

04:39:54.150 --> 04:39:54.160 align:start position:0%
of
 
04:39:54.160 --> 04:39:56.390 align:start position:0%
of
priston

04:39:56.390 --> 04:39:56.400 align:start position:0%
priston
 
04:39:59.190 --> 04:39:59.200 align:start position:0%
follow follow
 
04:40:01.470 --> 04:40:01.480 align:start position:0%
up so
 
04:40:05.510 --> 04:40:05.520 align:start position:0%
again any legislation that is passed by
 
04:40:09.830 --> 04:40:09.840 align:start position:0%
this house is going to be subject to the
 
04:40:12.830 --> 04:40:12.840 align:start position:0%
litigation that the Supreme Court passes
 
04:40:16.150 --> 04:40:16.160 align:start position:0%
or does not pass is that
 
04:40:16.160 --> 04:40:17.948 align:start position:0%
or does not pass is that
correct

04:40:17.948 --> 04:40:17.958 align:start position:0%
correct
 
04:40:20.750 --> 04:40:20.760 align:start position:0%
so are you referring to this resolution
 
04:40:24.510 --> 04:40:24.520 align:start position:0%
specifically or other perhaps upcoming
 
04:40:26.550 --> 04:40:26.560 align:start position:0%
uh attempts to restrict
 
04:40:29.788 --> 04:40:29.798 align:start position:0%
abortion any in all
 
04:40:33.030 --> 04:40:33.040 align:start position:0%
legislation resolution the
 
04:40:35.550 --> 04:40:35.560 align:start position:0%
FDA Supreme Court needs to make a
 
04:40:39.070 --> 04:40:39.080 align:start position:0%
decision on this it seems mute to me
 
04:40:42.030 --> 04:40:42.040 align:start position:0%
that we pass or do not pass something
 
04:40:45.430 --> 04:40:45.440 align:start position:0%
that is in court being litigated right
 
04:40:49.868 --> 04:40:49.878 align:start position:0%
now I mean we spend hours and hours of
 
04:40:56.230 --> 04:40:56.240 align:start position:0%
committee in um house and subcommittee
 
04:40:57.430 --> 04:40:57.440 align:start position:0%
and then
 
04:40:59.830 --> 04:40:59.840 align:start position:0%
the um and I don't want to get into a
 
04:41:02.990 --> 04:41:03.000 align:start position:0%
debate and then the Supreme Court comes
 
04:41:06.510 --> 04:41:06.520 align:start position:0%
down and rules against it it's it's kind
 
04:41:08.470 --> 04:41:08.480 align:start position:0%
of mute so the purpose of this
 
04:41:10.628 --> 04:41:10.638 align:start position:0%
resolution is to send a message while
 
04:41:12.270 --> 04:41:12.280 align:start position:0%
waiting for the Supreme Court like that
 
04:41:15.670 --> 04:41:15.680 align:start position:0%
is the uh uh part of the resolution is
 
04:41:17.788 --> 04:41:17.798 align:start position:0%
to say while these decisions are stayed
 
04:41:19.310 --> 04:41:19.320 align:start position:0%
from the lower court waiting for the
 
04:41:21.150 --> 04:41:21.160 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court to weigh in that this is
 
04:41:22.708 --> 04:41:22.718 align:start position:0%
the message from New Hampshire of where
 
04:41:27.670 --> 04:41:27.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:33.070 --> 04:41:33.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:35.270 --> 04:41:35.280 align:start position:0%
ahead I think
 
04:41:38.110 --> 04:41:38.120 align:start position:0%
you're asking for a lot from
 
04:41:38.120 --> 04:41:42.390 align:start position:0%
you're asking for a lot from
us

04:41:42.390 --> 04:41:42.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:45.230 --> 04:41:45.240 align:start position:0%
because this is something that is
 
04:41:50.230 --> 04:41:50.240 align:start position:0%
already in an ongoing litigation that
 
04:41:53.150 --> 04:41:53.160 align:start position:0%
regardless of the outcome
 
04:41:57.110 --> 04:41:57.120 align:start position:0%
positive or not is going to be
 
04:42:00.030 --> 04:42:00.040 align:start position:0%
decided by the court
 
04:42:04.670 --> 04:42:04.680 align:start position:0%
system and I cannot see us going forward
 
04:42:09.470 --> 04:42:09.480 align:start position:0%
with something that is not going to be
 
04:42:12.948 --> 04:42:12.958 align:start position:0%
um what the outcome you prefer so I
 
04:42:14.430 --> 04:42:14.440 align:start position:0%
think that's the value of a house
 
04:42:16.230 --> 04:42:16.240 align:start position:0%
concurrent resolution that you as a
 
04:42:18.510 --> 04:42:18.520 align:start position:0%
legislature can say what your position
 
04:42:20.590 --> 04:42:20.600 align:start position:0%
is on this court case in the in the
 
04:42:23.948 --> 04:42:23.958 align:start position:0%
first place and I think that's really uh
 
04:42:26.030 --> 04:42:26.040 align:start position:0%
really fantastic about the New Hampshire
 
04:42:28.070 --> 04:42:28.080 align:start position:0%
state house and options that you have in
 
04:42:29.590 --> 04:42:29.600 align:start position:0%
terms of the types of bills and
 
04:42:31.590 --> 04:42:31.600 align:start position:0%
resolutions that can be introduced is
 
04:42:33.190 --> 04:42:33.200 align:start position:0%
that you can take that position as a
 
04:42:35.670 --> 04:42:35.680 align:start position:0%
legislature without uh changing state
 
04:42:37.550 --> 04:42:37.560 align:start position:0%
law in this
 
04:42:40.708 --> 04:42:40.718 align:start position:0%
wayes philio thank you Mr chairman if I
 
04:42:44.110 --> 04:42:44.120 align:start position:0%
may uh two unrelated questions the first
 
04:42:46.310 --> 04:42:46.320 align:start position:0%
to your knowledge were the house to pass
 
04:42:48.470 --> 04:42:48.480 align:start position:0%
this HCR would it commit the state or
 
04:42:51.670 --> 04:42:51.680 align:start position:0%
the house to any action
 
04:42:53.670 --> 04:42:53.680 align:start position:0%
whatsoever thank you for the question as
 
04:42:56.310 --> 04:42:56.320 align:start position:0%
far as I know uh no it would be truly a
 
04:42:58.350 --> 04:42:58.360 align:start position:0%
position and a message that is sent not
 
04:43:00.750 --> 04:43:00.760 align:start position:0%
just to the federal delegation or to
 
04:43:03.350 --> 04:43:03.360 align:start position:0%
Congress um but also to your
 
04:43:05.470 --> 04:43:05.480 align:start position:0%
constituents to let them know where you
 
04:43:08.110 --> 04:43:08.120 align:start position:0%
stand on abortion early in pregnancy I
 
04:43:09.910 --> 04:43:09.920 align:start position:0%
feel like there's been a lot of debate
 
04:43:12.350 --> 04:43:12.360 align:start position:0%
um from the you know recent abortion law
 
04:43:14.510 --> 04:43:14.520 align:start position:0%
that was passed in 2021 but this is
 
04:43:16.708 --> 04:43:16.718 align:start position:0%
truly about abortion earlier in
 
04:43:19.270 --> 04:43:19.280 align:start position:0%
pregnancy so where you stand for your
 
04:43:21.990 --> 04:43:22.000 align:start position:0%
constituents so as a followup to that
 
04:43:24.550 --> 04:43:24.560 align:start position:0%
were the Supreme Court to rule against
 
04:43:27.788 --> 04:43:27.798 align:start position:0%
access to M prone would the state be
 
04:43:29.990 --> 04:43:30.000 align:start position:0%
involved in any litigation wor the uh
 
04:43:31.628 --> 04:43:31.638 align:start position:0%
state to pass this
 
04:43:34.628 --> 04:43:34.638 align:start position:0%
HCR thank you for the question so there
 
04:43:39.110 --> 04:43:39.120 align:start position:0%
was another lawsuit um happening
 
04:43:41.430 --> 04:43:41.440 align:start position:0%
simultaneously we sort of referenced it
 
04:43:43.070 --> 04:43:43.080 align:start position:0%
as the Washington lawsuit New Hampshire
 
04:43:45.350 --> 04:43:45.360 align:start position:0%
didn't sign on to that so New Hampshire
 
04:43:47.270 --> 04:43:47.280 align:start position:0%
would be subject to whatever comes out
 
04:43:49.430 --> 04:43:49.440 align:start position:0%
of the US Supreme Court this resolution
 
04:43:52.070 --> 04:43:52.080 align:start position:0%
wouldn't impact that in any way thank
 
04:43:53.470 --> 04:43:53.480 align:start position:0%
you it sounds as though it's fairly low
 
04:43:55.670 --> 04:43:55.680 align:start position:0%
risk now the second question that I have
 
04:43:58.910 --> 04:43:58.920 align:start position:0%
regards access to M pistone for Planned
 
04:44:01.270 --> 04:44:01.280 align:start position:0%
Parenthood and other providers for
 
04:44:02.948 --> 04:44:02.958 align:start position:0%
individuals who are underinsured or
 
04:44:05.868 --> 04:44:05.878 align:start position:0%
uninsured how is is uh payment for M
 
04:44:05.878 --> 04:44:08.750 align:start position:0%
uninsured how is is uh payment for M
prone

04:44:08.750 --> 04:44:08.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:11.550 --> 04:44:11.560 align:start position:0%
accessed uh thank you for the question I
 
04:44:13.070 --> 04:44:13.080 align:start position:0%
will not speak for other providers of
 
04:44:14.910 --> 04:44:14.920 align:start position:0%
course I only represent plant Parenthood
 
04:44:18.750 --> 04:44:18.760 align:start position:0%
but we provide uh care for people uh
 
04:44:20.670 --> 04:44:20.680 align:start position:0%
regardless of income we do not turn
 
04:44:22.430 --> 04:44:22.440 align:start position:0%
people away so if someone needs an
 
04:44:24.310 --> 04:44:24.320 align:start position:0%
abortion care needs abortion care and
 
04:44:26.788 --> 04:44:26.798 align:start position:0%
they can't afford it um of course the
 
04:44:31.030 --> 04:44:31.040 align:start position:0%
state we cannot um use State funds but
 
04:44:32.830 --> 04:44:32.840 align:start position:0%
um there is some philanthropy available
 
04:44:35.430 --> 04:44:35.440 align:start position:0%
for people who need um um who need some
 
04:44:37.030 --> 04:44:37.040 align:start position:0%
extra funding in order to get the care
 
04:44:38.868 --> 04:44:38.878 align:start position:0%
that they need and again we do not turn
 
04:44:38.878 --> 04:44:43.830 align:start position:0%
that they need and again we do not turn
people

04:44:43.830 --> 04:44:43.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:47.150 --> 04:44:47.160 align:start position:0%
away there so Sebert yeah this was kind
 
04:44:49.670 --> 04:44:49.680 align:start position:0%
of touched on earlier but um I just
 
04:44:54.670 --> 04:44:54.680 align:start position:0%
wanted to correct me if I'm wrong but
 
04:44:59.190 --> 04:44:59.200 align:start position:0%
um sorry this bill sends a message to
 
04:45:04.430 --> 04:45:04.440 align:start position:0%
providers who perform other OBG wein um
 
04:45:07.948 --> 04:45:07.958 align:start position:0%
you know Services as well am I correct
 
04:45:11.670 --> 04:45:11.680 align:start position:0%
on that such as you know screenings um
 
04:45:14.590 --> 04:45:14.600 align:start position:0%
you know and the shortage of doctors
 
04:45:17.788 --> 04:45:17.798 align:start position:0%
that we already have to perform that
 
04:45:22.990 --> 04:45:23.000 align:start position:0%
sure so so mistone is used um in other
 
04:45:25.230 --> 04:45:25.240 align:start position:0%
areas of of reproductive Health Care as
 
04:45:28.510 --> 04:45:28.520 align:start position:0%
well mostly um miscarriage management so
 
04:45:31.590 --> 04:45:31.600 align:start position:0%
that is another um situation where it is
 
04:45:33.470 --> 04:45:33.480 align:start position:0%
um another way to attack reproductive
 
04:45:35.230 --> 04:45:35.240 align:start position:0%
Health Care outside of the scope of
 
04:45:37.030 --> 04:45:37.040 align:start position:0%
abortion care certainly I think that's
 
04:45:39.270 --> 04:45:39.280 align:start position:0%
your question I'm I'm sorry if I didn't
 
04:45:40.868 --> 04:45:40.878 align:start position:0%
yeah I guess I was just wondering how
 
04:45:44.470 --> 04:45:44.480 align:start position:0%
many doctors would leave the state um
 
04:45:45.830 --> 04:45:45.840 align:start position:0%
you know we already touched on that
 
04:45:47.910 --> 04:45:47.920 align:start position:0%
earlier obviously that there was a
 
04:45:50.590 --> 04:45:50.600 align:start position:0%
concern about that um in someone's
 
04:45:53.110 --> 04:45:53.120 align:start position:0%
district and do you have statistics on
 
04:45:56.390 --> 04:45:56.400 align:start position:0%
how bad that issue that problem is
 
04:45:58.390 --> 04:45:58.400 align:start position:0%
currently in the state I certainly don't
 
04:46:00.150 --> 04:46:00.160 align:start position:0%
have statistics in front of me but I
 
04:46:01.990 --> 04:46:02.000 align:start position:0%
would say anytime that we are
 
04:46:05.990 --> 04:46:06.000 align:start position:0%
criminalizing um Health Care Providers
 
04:46:07.788 --> 04:46:07.798 align:start position:0%
it's creating an environment which is
 
04:46:11.230 --> 04:46:11.240 align:start position:0%
more difficult for them to want to work
 
04:46:13.470 --> 04:46:13.480 align:start position:0%
and so we you know there is a it is
 
04:46:17.030 --> 04:46:17.040 align:start position:0%
difficult to recruit uh trained healthc
 
04:46:18.510 --> 04:46:18.520 align:start position:0%
care providers who are providing
 
04:46:21.230 --> 04:46:21.240 align:start position:0%
reproductive Health in a rural area and
 
04:46:23.708 --> 04:46:23.718 align:start position:0%
so um the state being sort of you know
 
04:46:25.708 --> 04:46:25.718 align:start position:0%
hostile towards Reproductive Rights
 
04:46:27.750 --> 04:46:27.760 align:start position:0%
including criminalization of doctors who
 
04:46:29.470 --> 04:46:29.480 align:start position:0%
perform abortion care is certainly not
 
04:46:35.628 --> 04:46:35.638 align:start position:0%
helpful for um the environment here
 
04:46:38.788 --> 04:46:38.798 align:start position:0%
okay represent gagy thank you Mr
 
04:46:41.030 --> 04:46:41.040 align:start position:0%
chairman um if I heard you right you're
 
04:46:43.310 --> 04:46:43.320 align:start position:0%
not getting any state funding is that
 
04:46:47.230 --> 04:46:47.240 align:start position:0%
correct that's correct okay so followup
 
04:46:50.628 --> 04:46:50.638 align:start position:0%
followup thank you uh how much money are
 
04:46:53.150 --> 04:46:53.160 align:start position:0%
you getting from the federal
 
04:46:56.990 --> 04:46:57.000 align:start position:0%
funding um so uh planed Parenthood of
 
04:46:59.510 --> 04:46:59.520 align:start position:0%
Northern New England is a part of the
 
04:47:01.548 --> 04:47:01.558 align:start position:0%
federal title 10
 
04:47:04.150 --> 04:47:04.160 align:start position:0%
program and that is a program which was
 
04:47:06.990 --> 04:47:07.000 align:start position:0%
reestablished under President Biden um
 
04:47:08.788 --> 04:47:08.798 align:start position:0%
we were not in it during President
 
04:47:11.310 --> 04:47:11.320 align:start position:0%
Trump's time uh we are now back in the
 
04:47:15.628 --> 04:47:15.638 align:start position:0%
program it's a um small fund I don't
 
04:47:16.910 --> 04:47:16.920 align:start position:0%
again I don't have the numbers exactly
 
04:47:19.548 --> 04:47:19.558 align:start position:0%
in front of me but it is to help
 
04:47:23.030 --> 04:47:23.040 align:start position:0%
reimburse the cost of seeing patients
 
04:47:26.310 --> 04:47:26.320 align:start position:0%
who um who do not have access to care
 
04:47:28.510 --> 04:47:28.520 align:start position:0%
otherwise because they can't afford it
 
04:47:30.910 --> 04:47:30.920 align:start position:0%
so we are a provider who provides care
 
04:47:32.948 --> 04:47:32.958 align:start position:0%
to everyone on a sliding scale so if
 
04:47:35.230 --> 04:47:35.240 align:start position:0%
someone comes to us and they need birth
 
04:47:37.310 --> 04:47:37.320 align:start position:0%
control we make sure that we're able to
 
04:47:39.030 --> 04:47:39.040 align:start position:0%
see them and that we can pay for it
 
04:47:42.628 --> 04:47:42.638 align:start position:0%
regardless of how much they can pay um
 
04:47:46.270 --> 04:47:46.280 align:start position:0%
in that title T10 that fund has it does
 
04:47:49.670 --> 04:47:49.680 align:start position:0%
not cover abortion care there is also a
 
04:47:52.628 --> 04:47:52.638 align:start position:0%
state um pot of funds but we are not in
 
04:47:53.948 --> 04:47:53.958 align:start position:0%
that because the executive Council
 
04:47:55.868 --> 04:47:55.878 align:start position:0%
defunded planed Parenthood loping
 
04:47:57.948 --> 04:47:57.958 align:start position:0%
inequality five times in the last three
 
04:48:00.670 --> 04:48:00.680 align:start position:0%
years so you're still getting tax funded
 
04:48:04.390 --> 04:48:04.400 align:start position:0%
from citizens U income tax and stuff
 
04:48:06.350 --> 04:48:06.360 align:start position:0%
like that is that correct we have some
 
04:48:09.350 --> 04:48:09.360 align:start position:0%
federal dollars that go to
 
04:48:11.628 --> 04:48:11.638 align:start position:0%
certain um certain care that is not
 
04:48:14.150 --> 04:48:14.160 align:start position:0%
included in in abortion funds are not
 
04:48:16.628 --> 04:48:16.638 align:start position:0%
included in that thank
 
04:48:18.788 --> 04:48:18.798 align:start position:0%
you and I just want to be clear that's
 
04:48:20.070 --> 04:48:20.080 align:start position:0%
only Planned Parenthood I'm only
 
04:48:23.030 --> 04:48:23.040 align:start position:0%
speaking for that that's not every um
 
04:48:24.868 --> 04:48:24.878 align:start position:0%
Family Planning
 
04:48:28.350 --> 04:48:28.360 align:start position:0%
provider re fny thank you one last
 
04:48:31.430 --> 04:48:31.440 align:start position:0%
question I I forgot to mention this um I
 
04:48:33.070 --> 04:48:33.080 align:start position:0%
don't remember what what we changed in
 
04:48:34.948 --> 04:48:34.958 align:start position:0%
this state as far as how this gets
 
04:48:36.590 --> 04:48:36.600 align:start position:0%
prescribed to minors but what is your
 
04:48:39.390 --> 04:48:39.400 align:start position:0%
policy on on on that I really need to
 
04:48:42.788 --> 04:48:42.798 align:start position:0%
know yeah so um the law in New Hampshire
 
04:48:44.470 --> 04:48:44.480 align:start position:0%
is clear around parental notification
 
04:48:48.670 --> 04:48:48.680 align:start position:0%
for miners so if um if a minor has
 
04:48:50.230 --> 04:48:50.240 align:start position:0%
parental notification then they can
 
04:48:52.270 --> 04:48:52.280 align:start position:0%
certainly have an abortion whether it's
 
04:48:54.590 --> 04:48:54.600 align:start position:0%
um procedural or medication but uh the
 
04:48:59.030 --> 04:48:59.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:02.070 --> 04:49:02.080 align:start position:0%
notification other
 
04:49:04.590 --> 04:49:04.600 align:start position:0%
questions thank you for your testim we
 
04:49:07.150 --> 04:49:07.160 align:start position:0%
certainly U put you to work uh in your
 
04:49:08.350 --> 04:49:08.360 align:start position:0%
first trip
 
04:49:08.360 --> 04:49:11.030 align:start position:0%
first trip
here

04:49:11.030 --> 04:49:11.040 align:start position:0%
here
 
04:49:12.948 --> 04:49:12.958 align:start position:0%
for okay we have a card here from
 
04:49:15.070 --> 04:49:15.080 align:start position:0%
representative Eric
 
04:49:16.990 --> 04:49:17.000 align:start position:0%
Turner of
 
04:49:26.628 --> 04:49:26.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:28.830 --> 04:49:28.840 align:start position:0%
representative thank you chairman Muffet
 
04:49:32.830 --> 04:49:32.840 align:start position:0%
thank you members of the committee um uh
 
04:49:34.830 --> 04:49:34.840 align:start position:0%
uh my name is Eric turer from Brentwood
 
04:49:38.868 --> 04:49:38.878 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and um Rockingham district
 
04:49:42.868 --> 04:49:42.878 align:start position:0%
6 and um I hadn't intended I'm a
 
04:49:45.150 --> 04:49:45.160 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor of this piece of legislation
 
04:49:46.430 --> 04:49:46.440 align:start position:0%
I hadn't intend to speak but I just kind
 
04:49:47.948 --> 04:49:47.958 align:start position:0%
of wanted to round out a couple of the
 
04:49:51.150 --> 04:49:51.160 align:start position:0%
points that had been made today um uh
 
04:49:52.670 --> 04:49:52.680 align:start position:0%
I'll start off by acknowledging my
 
04:49:54.590 --> 04:49:54.600 align:start position:0%
wife's an obstetrician gynecologist who
 
04:49:57.150 --> 04:49:57.160 align:start position:0%
practiced in New Hampshire for 25 years
 
04:49:59.590 --> 04:49:59.600 align:start position:0%
I'm not a physici uh I do work in public
 
04:50:01.470 --> 04:50:01.480 align:start position:0%
health specifically around access to
 
04:50:03.350 --> 04:50:03.360 align:start position:0%
health care for the state and and other
 
04:50:06.548 --> 04:50:06.558 align:start position:0%
states Ross the country and federally um
 
04:50:08.150 --> 04:50:08.160 align:start position:0%
so the intersection between my wife's
 
04:50:11.070 --> 04:50:11.080 align:start position:0%
work and mine is is basically access to
 
04:50:13.590 --> 04:50:13.600 align:start position:0%
to um Healthcare and specifically in her
 
04:50:16.670 --> 04:50:16.680 align:start position:0%
case for women um
 
04:50:19.708 --> 04:50:19.718 align:start position:0%
uh I wanted to make a couple of points
 
04:50:21.868 --> 04:50:21.878 align:start position:0%
about this that I think sort of broaden
 
04:50:24.430 --> 04:50:24.440 align:start position:0%
out the discussion um the bill as has
 
04:50:26.270 --> 04:50:26.280 align:start position:0%
been stated is specifically focused on
 
04:50:28.910 --> 04:50:28.920 align:start position:0%
the use of M Meer Prestone for
 
04:50:31.030 --> 04:50:31.040 align:start position:0%
medication abortion that's the language
 
04:50:33.430 --> 04:50:33.440 align:start position:0%
in the bill um I wanted to point out
 
04:50:38.350 --> 04:50:38.360 align:start position:0%
that my a pyone is um not just used for
 
04:50:42.230 --> 04:50:42.240 align:start position:0%
abortion Services it um is used in
 
04:50:45.470 --> 04:50:45.480 align:start position:0%
combination with M proel as was cited
 
04:50:48.350 --> 04:50:48.360 align:start position:0%
for uh the treatment of uh early loss of
 
04:50:52.070 --> 04:50:52.080 align:start position:0%
a pregnancy as well it's not necessary
 
04:50:54.510 --> 04:50:54.520 align:start position:0%
for that treatment um but it has been
 
04:50:56.030 --> 04:50:56.040 align:start position:0%
found and I can read you a quote from
 
04:50:57.708 --> 04:50:57.718 align:start position:0%
the American Academy of family
 
04:51:00.990 --> 04:51:01.000 align:start position:0%
practitioners um research showing that
 
04:51:02.510 --> 04:51:02.520 align:start position:0%
it increases the safety and
 
04:51:04.310 --> 04:51:04.320 align:start position:0%
effectiveness of
 
04:51:07.590 --> 04:51:07.600 align:start position:0%
um dealing with an uh early pregnancy
 
04:51:10.948 --> 04:51:10.958 align:start position:0%
loss um and again the the what has taken
 
04:51:12.910 --> 04:51:12.920 align:start position:0%
place at the federal level is not
 
04:51:16.030 --> 04:51:16.040 align:start position:0%
specific to its use it was an across
 
04:51:18.510 --> 04:51:18.520 align:start position:0%
theboard um challenge to whether or not
 
04:51:23.150 --> 04:51:23.160 align:start position:0%
this drug was properly um uh authorized
 
04:51:25.628 --> 04:51:25.638 align:start position:0%
by the FDA and I think that's a very
 
04:51:28.110 --> 04:51:28.120 align:start position:0%
important point that I want to make sure
 
04:51:31.910 --> 04:51:31.920 align:start position:0%
um comes across um I just also wanted to
 
04:51:33.750 --> 04:51:33.760 align:start position:0%
correct someone had uh one of the other
 
04:51:35.390 --> 04:51:35.400 align:start position:0%
Representatives here had mentioned that
 
04:51:36.910 --> 04:51:36.920 align:start position:0%
there are no medically necessary
 
04:51:39.390 --> 04:51:39.400 align:start position:0%
abortions I think the the hearing began
 
04:51:42.510 --> 04:51:42.520 align:start position:0%
with a discussion of ectopic pregnancy
 
04:51:44.150 --> 04:51:44.160 align:start position:0%
you know I would say there are
 
04:51:47.070 --> 04:51:47.080 align:start position:0%
definitely medically necessary you know
 
04:51:49.030 --> 04:51:49.040 align:start position:0%
abortions and ectopic pregnancy would be
 
04:51:51.708 --> 04:51:51.718 align:start position:0%
one of the most obvious examples of of
 
04:51:54.070 --> 04:51:54.080 align:start position:0%
that um and again this would be the type
 
04:51:56.830 --> 04:51:56.840 align:start position:0%
of medication that would be used in in
 
04:51:58.708 --> 04:51:58.718 align:start position:0%
circumstances like that to my
 
04:51:59.948 --> 04:51:59.958 align:start position:0%
understanding as a
 
04:52:02.110 --> 04:52:02.120 align:start position:0%
non-physician um you know and I think
 
04:52:05.590 --> 04:52:05.600 align:start position:0%
it's important that um that when that
 
04:52:08.190 --> 04:52:08.200 align:start position:0%
kind of care is provided that it's most
 
04:52:10.270 --> 04:52:10.280 align:start position:0%
provided in the way that's most safe and
 
04:52:13.110 --> 04:52:13.120 align:start position:0%
effective um both clinically and from a
 
04:52:16.110 --> 04:52:16.120 align:start position:0%
cost-effective standpoint so again
 
04:52:18.948 --> 04:52:18.958 align:start position:0%
another reason why I think uh access to
 
04:52:22.070 --> 04:52:22.080 align:start position:0%
this medication is is worth us making a
 
04:52:24.628 --> 04:52:24.638 align:start position:0%
statement and again I I do agree that
 
04:52:28.070 --> 04:52:28.080 align:start position:0%
this is a an HCR so it is is not going
 
04:52:29.830 --> 04:52:29.840 align:start position:0%
to be challenged in terms of its
 
04:52:32.628 --> 04:52:32.638 align:start position:0%
Effectiveness as far as I understand um
 
04:52:34.708 --> 04:52:34.718 align:start position:0%
it is a statement it is not a law that
 
04:52:36.548 --> 04:52:36.558 align:start position:0%
can be in conflict with something that
 
04:52:39.110 --> 04:52:39.120 align:start position:0%
that um that is done at the federal
 
04:52:39.120 --> 04:52:40.670 align:start position:0%
that um that is done at the federal
level

04:52:40.670 --> 04:52:40.680 align:start position:0%
level
 
04:52:43.510 --> 04:52:43.520 align:start position:0%
um so just final thing to broaden out
 
04:52:45.110 --> 04:52:45.120 align:start position:0%
the picture
 
04:52:47.830 --> 04:52:47.840 align:start position:0%
um I think what's the bigger picture in
 
04:52:49.750 --> 04:52:49.760 align:start position:0%
this um the reason to make a statement
 
04:52:52.990 --> 04:52:53.000 align:start position:0%
like this as a state is this is an
 
04:52:56.190 --> 04:52:56.200 align:start position:0%
example of the court
 
04:52:59.070 --> 04:52:59.080 align:start position:0%
system stepping into an area that it has
 
04:53:01.150 --> 04:53:01.160 align:start position:0%
never stepped into as far as I know in
 
04:53:04.150 --> 04:53:04.160 align:start position:0%
this way before and basically over
 
04:53:06.910 --> 04:53:06.920 align:start position:0%
ruling um uh an
 
04:53:10.590 --> 04:53:10.600 align:start position:0%
Administration um agency the FDA in its
 
04:53:12.910 --> 04:53:12.920 align:start position:0%
findings you know and it's not that they
 
04:53:14.708 --> 04:53:14.718 align:start position:0%
see something wrong in the short term
 
04:53:16.190 --> 04:53:16.200 align:start position:0%
this Drug's been available and used
 
04:53:21.830 --> 04:53:21.840 align:start position:0%
safely for a long time um so it's a I
 
04:53:23.310 --> 04:53:23.320 align:start position:0%
hate using the term slippery slope but I
 
04:53:25.270 --> 04:53:25.280 align:start position:0%
will say it can be a slippery slope if
 
04:53:28.310 --> 04:53:28.320 align:start position:0%
we do not make a statement at this point
 
04:53:31.628 --> 04:53:31.638 align:start position:0%
um drugs are incredibly effective
 
04:53:34.510 --> 04:53:34.520 align:start position:0%
they're also incredibly cost costly
 
04:53:36.270 --> 04:53:36.280 align:start position:0%
they're a huge component of the cost of
 
04:53:39.350 --> 04:53:39.360 align:start position:0%
our medical system if we go down the
 
04:53:43.270 --> 04:53:43.280 align:start position:0%
road of blending you know the work of
 
04:53:47.110 --> 04:53:47.120 align:start position:0%
the FDA to authorize drugs that are safe
 
04:53:49.350 --> 04:53:49.360 align:start position:0%
and effective that's their standards you
 
04:53:51.868 --> 04:53:51.878 align:start position:0%
know with
 
04:53:55.070 --> 04:53:55.080 align:start position:0%
external um parameters that really are
 
04:53:57.350 --> 04:53:57.360 align:start position:0%
not part of that equation um I don't
 
04:53:59.510 --> 04:53:59.520 align:start position:0%
know where that ends but it's not in a
 
04:54:01.830 --> 04:54:01.840 align:start position:0%
good place in my opinion and that's part
 
04:54:04.150 --> 04:54:04.160 align:start position:0%
of the reason I I signed on co-sponsor
 
04:54:07.990 --> 04:54:08.000 align:start position:0%
this legislation um and I have to re
 
04:54:10.670 --> 04:54:10.680 align:start position:0%
respect representative finny's request
 
04:54:13.390 --> 04:54:13.400 align:start position:0%
that everyone answer the question um no
 
04:54:17.390 --> 04:54:17.400 align:start position:0%
I do not think um that the the state
 
04:54:19.628 --> 04:54:19.638 align:start position:0%
should restrict people's Reproductive
 
04:54:25.110 --> 04:54:25.120 align:start position:0%
Rights um I introduced uh cicr 2 last
 
04:54:27.430 --> 04:54:27.440 align:start position:0%
year on the on the floor of the house um
 
04:54:31.110 --> 04:54:31.120 align:start position:0%
which was a broad um uh guarantee of
 
04:54:34.190 --> 04:54:34.200 align:start position:0%
reproductive Freedom um I do sort of
 
04:54:37.030 --> 04:54:37.040 align:start position:0%
feel that this aspect of people's lives
 
04:54:38.350 --> 04:54:38.360 align:start position:0%
and their relationship with their
 
04:54:40.270 --> 04:54:40.280 align:start position:0%
medical advice that they get around it
 
04:54:44.548 --> 04:54:44.558 align:start position:0%
is the most deeply held um personal
 
04:54:47.390 --> 04:54:47.400 align:start position:0%
private expression of freedom and
 
04:54:49.628 --> 04:54:49.638 align:start position:0%
liberty that we could give to someone
 
04:54:52.830 --> 04:54:52.840 align:start position:0%
here in the state and so um hope that
 
04:54:57.070 --> 04:54:57.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:00.030 --> 04:55:00.040 align:start position:0%
question that question was asked earlier
 
04:55:02.110 --> 04:55:02.120 align:start position:0%
uh thanks for remembering representative
 
04:55:05.390 --> 04:55:05.400 align:start position:0%
finny's question say us for to call call
 
04:55:08.590 --> 04:55:08.600 align:start position:0%
on him uh representative levit you mind
 
04:55:10.670 --> 04:55:10.680 align:start position:0%
taking more questions oh no please
 
04:55:12.948 --> 04:55:12.958 align:start position:0%
representative levit thank you chair
 
04:55:16.510 --> 04:55:16.520 align:start position:0%
Mett as a sponsor of this bill were you
 
04:55:18.868 --> 04:55:18.878 align:start position:0%
aware that there is ongoing litigation
 
04:55:22.430 --> 04:55:22.440 align:start position:0%
in the Supreme Court yes that that was
 
04:55:25.230 --> 04:55:25.240 align:start position:0%
actually a major component of why I
 
04:55:28.190 --> 04:55:28.200 align:start position:0%
signed on to sponsor this bill um but
 
04:55:29.590 --> 04:55:29.600 align:start position:0%
you know if if they rule against you
 
04:55:33.030 --> 04:55:33.040 align:start position:0%
it's follow up follow up chair sorry if
 
04:55:35.430 --> 04:55:35.440 align:start position:0%
they rule against you then there's no
 
04:55:38.788 --> 04:55:38.798 align:start position:0%
standing there's no standing it's done
 
04:55:41.510 --> 04:55:41.520 align:start position:0%
so this this litigation I mean this
 
04:55:44.350 --> 04:55:44.360 align:start position:0%
legislation that we're about to vote on
 
04:55:47.948 --> 04:55:47.958 align:start position:0%
could have no standing by June July
 
04:55:50.430 --> 04:55:50.440 align:start position:0%
whatever it comes down that's that's the
 
04:55:52.670 --> 04:55:52.680 align:start position:0%
fact would you agree with that well I
 
04:55:54.990 --> 04:55:55.000 align:start position:0%
I'm not a legal expert um in terms of
 
04:55:57.230 --> 04:55:57.240 align:start position:0%
what is or isn't standing I don't know
 
04:55:58.830 --> 04:55:58.840 align:start position:0%
and I I tried to say this at the
 
04:56:01.628 --> 04:56:01.638 align:start position:0%
beginning my impression is that as a
 
04:56:04.190 --> 04:56:04.200 align:start position:0%
resolution it's more of a statement and
 
04:56:06.110 --> 04:56:06.120 align:start position:0%
and couldn't be tested against any
 
04:56:09.430 --> 04:56:09.440 align:start position:0%
particular Federal Regulation or or
 
04:56:11.590 --> 04:56:11.600 align:start position:0%
decision that you know because it
 
04:56:14.230 --> 04:56:14.240 align:start position:0%
doesn't carry any weight of Law and
 
04:56:15.470 --> 04:56:15.480 align:start position:0%
again I'm speaking as though I'm a
 
04:56:17.910 --> 04:56:17.920 align:start position:0%
lawyer when I'm not um this is our
 
04:56:20.150 --> 04:56:20.160 align:start position:0%
ability as legislature to say that we
 
04:56:21.270 --> 04:56:21.280 align:start position:0%
see a
 
04:56:23.990 --> 04:56:24.000 align:start position:0%
problem um with what's going on at the
 
04:56:27.030 --> 04:56:27.040 align:start position:0%
federal level and my interest in signing
 
04:56:29.548 --> 04:56:29.558 align:start position:0%
on to this piece of legislation was to
 
04:56:32.030 --> 04:56:32.040 align:start position:0%
um essentially make that statement you
 
04:56:35.430 --> 04:56:35.440 align:start position:0%
know in real time such that um that can
 
04:56:38.430 --> 04:56:38.440 align:start position:0%
be part of the record in terms of how uh
 
04:56:40.990 --> 04:56:41.000 align:start position:0%
the federal system and the the Supreme
 
04:56:43.708 --> 04:56:43.718 align:start position:0%
Court potentially comes down on this so
 
04:56:45.548 --> 04:56:45.558 align:start position:0%
yeah it it was not an accident or an
 
04:56:47.350 --> 04:56:47.360 align:start position:0%
overstep it was a purposeful decision I
 
04:56:49.430 --> 04:56:49.440 align:start position:0%
think this is a very very
 
04:56:53.270 --> 04:56:53.280 align:start position:0%
important obstacle that needs to be
 
04:56:55.070 --> 04:56:55.080 align:start position:0%
that's not a question thank you thank
 
04:56:56.910 --> 04:56:56.920 align:start position:0%
you that's
 
04:57:00.150 --> 04:57:00.160 align:start position:0%
it representative Philly up would I be
 
04:57:02.110 --> 04:57:02.120 align:start position:0%
accurate in saying that we do not
 
04:57:03.830 --> 04:57:03.840 align:start position:0%
require standing to pass this bill
 
04:57:06.030 --> 04:57:06.040 align:start position:0%
because it's not part of litigation and
 
04:57:07.910 --> 04:57:07.920 align:start position:0%
even if we were to file an amicus brief
 
04:57:09.230 --> 04:57:09.240 align:start position:0%
we would have standing because you don't
 
04:57:12.270 --> 04:57:12.280 align:start position:0%
require standing to file an amicus brief
 
04:57:14.310 --> 04:57:14.320 align:start position:0%
um again I'm not going to try and and
 
04:57:17.590 --> 04:57:17.600 align:start position:0%
and weigh in on legal matters in terms
 
04:57:19.310 --> 04:57:19.320 align:start position:0%
of what does or doesn't constitute
 
04:57:21.948 --> 04:57:21.958 align:start position:0%
standing but my impression is that that
 
04:57:24.310 --> 04:57:24.320 align:start position:0%
passing this resolution does not put us
 
04:57:27.310 --> 04:57:27.320 align:start position:0%
in conflict with any um Federal
 
04:57:29.548 --> 04:57:29.558 align:start position:0%
decisions that are current or could come
 
04:57:30.830 --> 04:57:30.840 align:start position:0%
down in the
 
04:57:33.590 --> 04:57:33.600 align:start position:0%
future we have at least one lawyer on
 
04:57:35.510 --> 04:57:35.520 align:start position:0%
this committee and when these things
 
04:57:38.150 --> 04:57:38.160 align:start position:0%
come up um sometimes people look to the
 
04:57:40.350 --> 04:57:40.360 align:start position:0%
lawyer but I uh I'm going to try not to
 
04:57:42.070 --> 04:57:42.080 align:start position:0%
do that this is a
 
04:57:44.788 --> 04:57:44.798 align:start position:0%
hearing uh any other
 
04:57:47.150 --> 04:57:47.160 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none uh thank you
 
04:57:48.868 --> 04:57:48.878 align:start position:0%
representative thank you for your time
 
04:57:51.230 --> 04:57:51.240 align:start position:0%
and thank you for considering this
 
04:57:54.590 --> 04:57:54.600 align:start position:0%
bill and again this isn't it's it's not
 
04:57:58.190 --> 04:57:58.200 align:start position:0%
a uh Bill P it's a HCR it's a con host
 
04:57:58.200 --> 04:58:02.110 align:start position:0%
a uh Bill P it's a HCR it's a con host
concurrent

04:58:02.110 --> 04:58:02.120 align:start position:0%

perpetually stigmatized and litigated
 
04:59:35.708 --> 04:59:35.718 align:start position:0%
environment we have managed to see
 
04:59:38.110 --> 04:59:38.120 align:start position:0%
important advances in abortion care over
 
04:59:40.628 --> 04:59:40.638 align:start position:0%
this time we now have Decades of
 
04:59:42.190 --> 04:59:42.200 align:start position:0%

04:59:47.628 --> 04:59:47.638 align:start position:0%
myth
 
04:59:50.470 --> 04:59:50.480 align:start position:0%
aistone as it should be in all areas of
 
04:59:53.310 --> 04:59:53.320 align:start position:0%
Medical Care abortion practice advances
 
04:59:55.708 --> 04:59:55.718 align:start position:0%
and changes as science data and
 
04:59:58.708 --> 04:59:58.718 align:start position:0%
experience change as we would expect in
 
05:00:01.390 --> 05:00:01.400 align:start position:0%
any area of healthc care we can safely
 
05:00:03.990 --> 05:00:04.000 align:start position:0%
and if we can safely effectively offer a
 
05:00:08.150 --> 05:00:08.160 align:start position:0%
less invasive option for care we must
 
05:00:10.510 --> 05:00:10.520 align:start position:0%
when we can avoid invasive procedures
 
05:00:12.750 --> 05:00:12.760 align:start position:0%
and offer patients an option to manage
 
05:00:14.910 --> 05:00:14.920 align:start position:0%
their care at home with the support of
 
05:00:18.150 --> 05:00:18.160 align:start position:0%
their families we should when we can
 
05:00:20.868 --> 05:00:20.878 align:start position:0%
expand care to Rural and underserved
 
05:00:24.830 --> 05:00:24.840 align:start position:0%
areas keep costs uh affordable and make
 
05:00:27.150 --> 05:00:27.160 align:start position:0%
access possible for our lowest income
 
05:00:29.788 --> 05:00:29.798 align:start position:0%
neighbors and work toward true Equitable
 
05:00:32.070 --> 05:00:32.080 align:start position:0%
access to Medical Care in New Hampshire
 
05:00:36.230 --> 05:00:36.240 align:start position:0%
we should today over 50% of our patients
 
05:00:38.990 --> 05:00:39.000 align:start position:0%
choose medication abortion it's hard to
 
05:00:41.030 --> 05:00:41.040 align:start position:0%
overstate the importance of medication
 
05:00:42.788 --> 05:00:42.798 align:start position:0%
abortion in our modern Healthcare
 
05:00:45.948 --> 05:00:45.958 align:start position:0%
landscape for so many reasons we implore
 
05:00:47.750 --> 05:00:47.760 align:start position:0%
you to recognize the importance of this
 
05:00:50.788 --> 05:00:50.798 align:start position:0%
moment the Federal Protection backing up
 
05:00:53.350 --> 05:00:53.360 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's consistent bipartisan
 
05:00:55.628 --> 05:00:55.638 align:start position:0%
commitment to legal abortion care has
 
05:00:58.830 --> 05:00:58.840 align:start position:0%
ended because New Hampshire citizens and
 
05:01:01.030 --> 05:01:01.040 align:start position:0%
our elected bipartisan leaders have
 
05:01:03.548 --> 05:01:03.558 align:start position:0%
chosen to maintain legal abortion care
 
05:01:06.750 --> 05:01:06.760 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire we must actively resist
 
05:01:08.750 --> 05:01:08.760 align:start position:0%
any medically unnecessary restrictions
 
05:01:11.270 --> 05:01:11.280 align:start position:0%
on medication abortion the current
 
05:01:13.548 --> 05:01:13.558 align:start position:0%
threats to medication abortion are not
 
05:01:16.110 --> 05:01:16.120 align:start position:0%
based on best medical practice they're
 
05:01:18.110 --> 05:01:18.120 align:start position:0%
steps toward undermining our state's
 
05:01:19.788 --> 05:01:19.798 align:start position:0%
commitment to personal freedom in
 
05:01:22.708 --> 05:01:22.718 align:start position:0%

1970s so I've counseled lots of women
 
05:03:40.150 --> 05:03:40.160 align:start position:0%
who had questions about pregnancy and
 
05:03:43.430 --> 05:03:43.440 align:start position:0%
options related to their pregnancies
 
05:03:45.670 --> 05:03:45.680 align:start position:0%
I've always included legal abortion as
 
05:03:47.670 --> 05:03:47.680 align:start position:0%
part of the information that I've been
 
05:03:50.310 --> 05:03:50.320 align:start position:0%
given my patients and in those
 
05:03:52.470 --> 05:03:52.480 align:start position:0%
conversations I have learned so much
 
05:03:55.190 --> 05:03:55.200 align:start position:0%
I've learned about the multitude of
 
05:03:58.708 --> 05:03:58.718 align:start position:0%
personal circumstances which led some of
 
05:04:01.350 --> 05:04:01.360 align:start position:0%
the women I counseled to choose
 
05:04:04.270 --> 05:04:04.280 align:start position:0%
abortion I learned that abortion is an
 
05:04:06.948 --> 05:04:06.958 align:start position:0%
absolutely necessary element of taking
 
05:04:08.628 --> 05:04:08.638 align:start position:0%
care of women's
 
05:04:12.470 --> 05:04:12.480 align:start position:0%
health and that it is
 
05:04:15.670 --> 05:04:15.680 align:start position:0%
literally impossible and certainly
 
05:04:18.110 --> 05:04:18.120 align:start position:0%
inappropriate to try to craft
 
05:04:20.670 --> 05:04:20.680 align:start position:0%
legislation in this area in answer to
 
05:04:22.830 --> 05:04:22.840 align:start position:0%
the anticipated question I do not
 
05:04:27.270 --> 05:04:27.280 align:start position:0%
believe that legislation has any role in
 
05:04:29.990 --> 05:04:30.000 align:start position:0%
reproductive Health Care this is far too
 
05:04:33.510 --> 05:04:33.520 align:start position:0%
nuanced and far too personal a matter
 
05:04:38.628 --> 05:04:38.638 align:start position:0%
matter um I do know a lot about the FDA
 
05:04:40.868 --> 05:04:40.878 align:start position:0%
as an internist believe me I have
 
05:04:43.270 --> 05:04:43.280 align:start position:0%
prescribed lots of
 
05:04:46.708 --> 05:04:46.718 align:start position:0%
medicines that's what we do I've relied
 
05:04:48.590 --> 05:04:48.600 align:start position:0%
on guidance from the Food and Drug
 
05:04:49.990 --> 05:04:50.000 align:start position:0%
Administration so that I could be
 
05:04:52.548 --> 05:04:52.558 align:start position:0%
confident my patient care conformed to
 
05:04:56.270 --> 05:04:56.280 align:start position:0%
best medical practices you see the FDA
 
05:04:58.948 --> 05:04:58.958 align:start position:0%
has a very rigorous process prior to
 
05:05:01.788 --> 05:05:01.798 align:start position:0%
approving a medicine and after that
 
05:05:03.948 --> 05:05:03.958 align:start position:0%
medicine is prove they continue to
 
05:05:06.230 --> 05:05:06.240 align:start position:0%
collect reports about what happens to
 
05:05:08.948 --> 05:05:08.958 align:start position:0%
people who take the medicine so safety
 
05:05:10.830 --> 05:05:10.840 align:start position:0%
ongoing safety is very much their
 
05:05:12.990 --> 05:05:13.000 align:start position:0%
mission they get reports and case
 
05:05:14.948 --> 05:05:14.958 align:start position:0%
reports from doctors all over the
 
05:05:18.190 --> 05:05:18.200 align:start position:0%
country um Nations around the world
 
05:05:20.628 --> 05:05:20.638 align:start position:0%
emulate the standards of drug safety set
 
05:05:22.910 --> 05:05:22.920 align:start position:0%
by the FDA making it a global Authority
 
05:05:25.788 --> 05:05:25.798 align:start position:0%
and this case that we're talking about
 
05:05:29.030 --> 05:05:29.040 align:start position:0%
today past uh that's coming to the
 
05:05:30.910 --> 05:05:30.920 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court is really
 
05:05:34.030 --> 05:05:34.040 align:start position:0%
threatening our access to safe medicines
 
05:05:37.868 --> 05:05:37.878 align:start position:0%
in a in a much greater and broader sense
 
05:05:41.628 --> 05:05:41.638 align:start position:0%
if one medicine can be denied um that is
 
05:05:45.150 --> 05:05:45.160 align:start position:0%
safe effective and needed uh we could we
 
05:05:47.070 --> 05:05:47.080 align:start position:0%
could lose access to more we shouldn't
 
05:05:49.510 --> 05:05:49.520 align:start position:0%
lose track of that so as you consider
 
05:05:52.350 --> 05:05:52.360 align:start position:0%
hcr1 please keep in mind the stature of
 
05:05:55.070 --> 05:05:55.080 align:start position:0%
this important Federal agency whose
 
05:05:57.070 --> 05:05:57.080 align:start position:0%
mission and Authority I consider very
 
05:06:00.548 --> 05:06:00.558 align:start position:0%
important certainly to my practice and
 
05:06:02.510 --> 05:06:02.520 align:start position:0%
have um I do want to take you back to
 
05:06:06.070 --> 05:06:06.080 align:start position:0%
1991 for a moment when having a legal
 
05:06:08.548 --> 05:06:08.558 align:start position:0%
abortion in the United States meant you
 
05:06:10.548 --> 05:06:10.558 align:start position:0%
had to have a surgical procedure there
 
05:06:13.788 --> 05:06:13.798 align:start position:0%
was no non-surgical option in general if
 
05:06:15.750 --> 05:06:15.760 align:start position:0%
you ask a person would you rather have a
 
05:06:19.030 --> 05:06:19.040 align:start position:0%
surgical procedure or take some pills
 
05:06:20.868 --> 05:06:20.878 align:start position:0%
you're generally going to hear a lot of
 
05:06:23.110 --> 05:06:23.120 align:start position:0%
people prefer the pill option not
 
05:06:26.310 --> 05:06:26.320 align:start position:0%
everyone but it's an important option
 
05:06:30.990 --> 05:06:31.000 align:start position:0%
and um at the time 1991 there were no
 
05:06:32.750 --> 05:06:32.760 align:start position:0%
such options in the United States States
 
05:06:35.788 --> 05:06:35.798 align:start position:0%
but in France and in China there were
 
05:06:38.830 --> 05:06:38.840 align:start position:0%
there were medicines being used safely
 
05:06:41.948 --> 05:06:41.958 align:start position:0%
to non-surgically induce abortion under
 
05:06:44.190 --> 05:06:44.200 align:start position:0%
Reagan and Bush these were not allowed
 
05:06:46.708 --> 05:06:46.718 align:start position:0%
in the states the FDA was barring
 
05:06:48.830 --> 05:06:48.840 align:start position:0%
importation in of these drugs which
 
05:06:50.750 --> 05:06:50.760 align:start position:0%
included meph Prestone the one we're
 
05:06:53.310 --> 05:06:53.320 align:start position:0%
talking about today the majority of
 
05:06:55.070 --> 05:06:55.080 align:start position:0%
Americans who have always supported
 
05:06:58.990 --> 05:06:59.000 align:start position:0%
abortion access disagreed vehemently and
 
05:07:00.830 --> 05:07:00.840 align:start position:0%
I do have more to say about this that
 
05:07:02.430 --> 05:07:02.440 align:start position:0%
I'm going to give you in my written
 
05:07:04.430 --> 05:07:04.440 align:start position:0%
testimony cuz I know that my time is
 
05:07:07.230 --> 05:07:07.240 align:start position:0%
short but I'm going to summarize here
 
05:07:10.310 --> 05:07:10.320 align:start position:0%
and say that the nation listened to New
 
05:07:12.868 --> 05:07:12.878 align:start position:0%
Hampshire when the Republican dominated
 
05:07:14.430 --> 05:07:14.440 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire General Court in a
 
05:07:17.628 --> 05:07:17.638 align:start position:0%
bipartisan manner adopted the first
 
05:07:20.190 --> 05:07:20.200 align:start position:0%
resolution specifically urging the FDA
 
05:07:22.310 --> 05:07:22.320 align:start position:0%
to permit Research into medication
 
05:07:26.190 --> 05:07:26.200 align:start position:0%
abortion um the nation listened and
 
05:07:28.670 --> 05:07:28.680 align:start position:0%
today as we've heard these non-surgical
 
05:07:31.750 --> 05:07:31.760 align:start position:0%
safe Alternatives offer privacy and
 
05:07:31.760 --> 05:07:33.230 align:start position:0%
safe Alternatives offer privacy and
convenience

05:07:33.230 --> 05:07:33.240 align:start position:0%
convenience
 
05:07:36.510 --> 05:07:36.520 align:start position:0%
and are used widely and with confidence
 
05:07:39.070 --> 05:07:39.080 align:start position:0%
we should never be in a position where
 
05:07:41.470 --> 05:07:41.480 align:start position:0%
judges in Texas decide that Granite
 
05:07:44.990 --> 05:07:45.000 align:start position:0%
Staters can't get safe effective drugs
 
05:07:47.628 --> 05:07:47.638 align:start position:0%
please condemn in no uncertain terms all
 
05:07:50.390 --> 05:07:50.400 align:start position:0%
politically motivated intrusion into the
 
05:07:52.990 --> 05:07:53.000 align:start position:0%
valuable work of the FDA by voting ought
 
05:07:55.788 --> 05:07:55.798 align:start position:0%
to pass on hcr1 thank you very much for
 
05:07:58.190 --> 05:07:58.200 align:start position:0%
hearing my testimony and I would be
 
05:08:01.190 --> 05:08:01.200 align:start position:0%
willing to answer questions if I'm
 
05:08:01.200 --> 05:08:03.070 align:start position:0%
willing to answer questions if I'm
able

05:08:03.070 --> 05:08:03.080 align:start position:0%
able
 
05:08:04.868 --> 05:08:04.878 align:start position:0%
uh represent Finny the question that you
 
05:08:07.070 --> 05:08:07.080 align:start position:0%
wanted again if you could repeat oh so
 
05:08:10.030 --> 05:08:10.040 align:start position:0%
you you handled that up front Okay uh
 
05:08:12.868 --> 05:08:12.878 align:start position:0%
anything else representative
 
05:08:15.788 --> 05:08:15.798 align:start position:0%
gagy thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
05:08:19.310 --> 05:08:19.320 align:start position:0%
doctor for taking my question do they
 
05:08:22.310 --> 05:08:22.320 align:start position:0%
still do the hypocritic oath when in the
 
05:08:23.868 --> 05:08:23.878 align:start position:0%
in the medical you know I was reading up
 
05:08:25.190 --> 05:08:25.200 align:start position:0%
about that because I thought this might
 
05:08:27.868 --> 05:08:27.878 align:start position:0%
come up um there's several Hippocratic
 
05:08:29.948 --> 05:08:29.958 align:start position:0%
Oaths they're used in some medical
 
05:08:32.708 --> 05:08:32.718 align:start position:0%
schools not all and there's different
 
05:08:35.910 --> 05:08:35.920 align:start position:0%
versions so sometimes isn't there one
 
05:08:38.150 --> 05:08:38.160 align:start position:0%
that says first Do no harm there
 
05:08:38.160 --> 05:08:39.868 align:start position:0%
that says first Do no harm there
certainly

05:08:39.868 --> 05:08:39.878 align:start position:0%
certainly
 
05:08:44.390 --> 05:08:44.400 align:start position:0%
is so full disclosure I'm in favor of
 
05:08:47.830 --> 05:08:47.840 align:start position:0%
abortion to save the life of the
 
05:08:51.390 --> 05:08:51.400 align:start position:0%
mother however for me my personal
 
05:08:55.150 --> 05:08:55.160 align:start position:0%
opinion is that an abortion that is not
 
05:08:57.948 --> 05:08:57.958 align:start position:0%
necessary to save the life of the mother
 
05:09:00.310 --> 05:09:00.320 align:start position:0%
is the taking of an innocent human life
 
05:09:03.390 --> 05:09:03.400 align:start position:0%
you can take that to the bank
 
05:09:05.430 --> 05:09:05.440 align:start position:0%
well if that's a question I I would
 
05:09:08.590 --> 05:09:08.600 align:start position:0%
respond that you said a very important
 
05:09:10.750 --> 05:09:10.760 align:start position:0%
thing when you said in my personal
 
05:09:14.750 --> 05:09:14.760 align:start position:0%
opinion and you and any woman who feels
 
05:09:17.590 --> 05:09:17.600 align:start position:0%
the same should definitely not have to
 
05:09:18.708 --> 05:09:18.718 align:start position:0%
have an
 
05:09:21.788 --> 05:09:21.798 align:start position:0%
abortion absolutely this is a personal
 
05:09:25.990 --> 05:09:26.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:29.510 --> 05:09:29.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:32.750 --> 05:09:32.760 align:start position:0%
questions thank you Dr Lynn Dr Ry Hayes

last night and uh he's also sent me some
 
05:09:40.788 --> 05:09:40.798 align:start position:0%
information that yes if you could pass
 
05:09:43.030 --> 05:09:43.040 align:start position:0%
that that would be
 
05:09:46.230 --> 05:09:46.240 align:start position:0%

everyone deserves control over their
 
05:10:46.670 --> 05:10:46.680 align:start position:0%
life their body and their story and
 
05:10:50.030 --> 05:10:50.040 align:start position:0%
today I'd like to share my story with
 
05:10:52.830 --> 05:10:52.840 align:start position:0%
you I took my first pregnancy test
 
05:10:54.628 --> 05:10:54.638 align:start position:0%
during a lunch break from
 
05:10:57.990 --> 05:10:58.000 align:start position:0%
work I hadn't seriously confronted the
 
05:11:00.948 --> 05:11:00.958 align:start position:0%
possibility that I might actually be
 
05:11:04.190 --> 05:11:04.200 align:start position:0%
pregnant but then the accusatory double
 
05:11:06.910 --> 05:11:06.920 align:start position:0%
lines on the first test and the same on
 
05:11:09.750 --> 05:11:09.760 align:start position:0%
the second taken only minutes later as I
 
05:11:11.628 --> 05:11:11.638 align:start position:0%
crouched on the tile floor in my
 
05:11:14.590 --> 05:11:14.600 align:start position:0%
fluorescent lit dorm bathroom furiously
 
05:11:17.670 --> 05:11:17.680 align:start position:0%
Googling false positive pregnancy tests
 
05:11:20.230 --> 05:11:20.240 align:start position:0%
hoping Beyond hope that it was a
 
05:11:22.750 --> 05:11:22.760 align:start position:0%
fluke it
 
05:11:25.430 --> 05:11:25.440 align:start position:0%
wasn't I went back to work to finish out
 
05:11:27.548 --> 05:11:27.558 align:start position:0%
the day with the irrevocable knowledge
 
05:11:30.190 --> 05:11:30.200 align:start position:0%
that a process had begun Within Me
 
05:11:33.230 --> 05:11:33.240 align:start position:0%
Gathering momentum
 
05:11:35.150 --> 05:11:35.160 align:start position:0%
when I found out I was pregnant I was
 
05:11:38.310 --> 05:11:38.320 align:start position:0%
making minimum wage living in oncampus
 
05:11:40.910 --> 05:11:40.920 align:start position:0%
housing and still had no clue what my
 
05:11:42.788 --> 05:11:42.798 align:start position:0%
next step would be after my fellowship
 
05:11:45.470 --> 05:11:45.480 align:start position:0%
ended in nine months I did not know
 
05:11:48.230 --> 05:11:48.240 align:start position:0%
where I would be living what I wanted to
 
05:11:50.670 --> 05:11:50.680 align:start position:0%
do with my life what career I was
 
05:11:53.390 --> 05:11:53.400 align:start position:0%
interested in but I did know that I
 
05:11:54.948 --> 05:11:54.958 align:start position:0%
didn't want to be
 
05:11:57.430 --> 05:11:57.440 align:start position:0%
pregnant this was one area of my life
 
05:12:00.470 --> 05:12:00.480 align:start position:0%
where the path forward was absolutely
 
05:12:02.830 --> 05:12:02.840 align:start position:0%
clear I made an appointment at Planned
 
05:12:04.548 --> 05:12:04.558 align:start position:0%
Parenthood to confirm my pregnancy as
 
05:12:07.190 --> 05:12:07.200 align:start position:0%
quickly as possible at this point I was
 
05:12:09.670 --> 05:12:09.680 align:start position:0%
6 weeks along and then I made an
 
05:12:11.150 --> 05:12:11.160 align:start position:0%
appointment for the abortion which had
 
05:12:13.628 --> 05:12:13.638 align:start position:0%
to be two weeks
 
05:12:16.510 --> 05:12:16.520 align:start position:0%
out every single day I had to exist as a
 
05:12:19.070 --> 05:12:19.080 align:start position:0%
pregnant person was a struggle just the
 
05:12:20.868 --> 05:12:20.878 align:start position:0%
physical experience of being pregnant
 
05:12:20.878 --> 05:12:21.628 align:start position:0%
physical experience of being pregnant
was

05:12:21.628 --> 05:12:21.638 align:start position:0%
was
 
05:12:24.548 --> 05:12:24.558 align:start position:0%
horrifying my body was not my own it was
 
05:12:27.830 --> 05:12:27.840 align:start position:0%
sore tired and sick while a wanted
 
05:12:30.230 --> 05:12:30.240 align:start position:0%
pregnancy can be a magical thing this
 
05:12:31.948 --> 05:12:31.958 align:start position:0%
experience truly showed me that no one
 
05:12:33.270 --> 05:12:33.280 align:start position:0%
should be pregnant if they do not want
 
05:12:35.788 --> 05:12:35.798 align:start position:0%
to be it was a complete and total loss
 
05:12:38.350 --> 05:12:38.360 align:start position:0%
of control my body felt like it was at
 
05:12:41.310 --> 05:12:41.320 align:start position:0%
odds with me tormenting me the pregnancy
 
05:12:43.750 --> 05:12:43.760 align:start position:0%
and its consequences were all consuming
 
05:12:45.708 --> 05:12:45.718 align:start position:0%
I felt terrible I performed terribly at
 
05:12:48.708 --> 05:12:48.718 align:start position:0%
work and I didn't see most if any of my
 
05:12:51.990 --> 05:12:52.000 align:start position:0%
friends I had a medication abortion so I
 
05:12:53.788 --> 05:12:53.798 align:start position:0%
took one pill at the health center and
 
05:12:55.750 --> 05:12:55.760 align:start position:0%
then the next ones later that night at
 
05:12:58.430 --> 05:12:58.440 align:start position:0%
home when I woke up the next morning a
 
05:13:00.590 --> 05:13:00.600 align:start position:0%
great weight had been lifted and my body
 
05:13:02.310 --> 05:13:02.320 align:start position:0%
was still
 
05:13:04.948 --> 05:13:04.958 align:start position:0%
the sense of momentum had calmed and for
 
05:13:06.948 --> 05:13:06.958 align:start position:0%
the first time in weeks time stretched
 
05:13:09.390 --> 05:13:09.400 align:start position:0%
forward freely no looming and dreaded
 
05:13:11.390 --> 05:13:11.400 align:start position:0%
deadline approaching with every second
 
05:13:14.470 --> 05:13:14.480 align:start position:0%
that passed I felt at home in my body
 
05:13:16.590 --> 05:13:16.600 align:start position:0%
and at home in my
 
05:13:19.190 --> 05:13:19.200 align:start position:0%
life I am eternally grateful for my
 
05:13:21.470 --> 05:13:21.480 align:start position:0%
abortion everything in my life now that
 
05:13:23.310 --> 05:13:23.320 align:start position:0%
I have worked for a career I'm
 
05:13:25.110 --> 05:13:25.120 align:start position:0%
passionate about the graduate degree I'm
 
05:13:27.230 --> 05:13:27.240 align:start position:0%
in the process of earning wouldn't have
 
05:13:29.830 --> 05:13:29.840 align:start position:0%
been possible without my abortion I want
 
05:13:31.628 --> 05:13:31.638 align:start position:0%
every person to have the options I had
 
05:13:33.548 --> 05:13:33.558 align:start position:0%
with when I needed them I don't want
 
05:13:35.150 --> 05:13:35.160 align:start position:0%
anyone to be trapped in the suffocating
 
05:13:36.910 --> 05:13:36.920 align:start position:0%
feeling of an unwanted
 
05:13:40.470 --> 05:13:40.480 align:start position:0%
pregnancy I urge you to support hcr1
 
05:13:42.390 --> 05:13:42.400 align:start position:0%
which is a concrete action the state can
 
05:13:44.270 --> 05:13:44.280 align:start position:0%
do to show support for medication
 
05:13:46.750 --> 05:13:46.760 align:start position:0%
abortion access in New
 
05:13:48.990 --> 05:13:49.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire pure and simple my abortion
 
05:13:51.548 --> 05:13:51.558 align:start position:0%
gave me my life back I was able to write
 
05:13:54.150 --> 05:13:54.160 align:start position:0%
my own story the way I wanted and that's
 
05:13:56.510 --> 05:13:56.520 align:start position:0%
what we are fighting for for the right
 
05:13:57.948 --> 05:13:57.958 align:start position:0%
of people everywhere to control the
 
05:14:00.510 --> 05:14:00.520 align:start position:0%
trajectory of their very lives that's
 
05:14:02.628 --> 05:14:02.638 align:start position:0%
what I want to protect
 
05:14:07.070 --> 05:14:07.080 align:start position:0%

05:15:20.990 --> 05:15:21.000 align:start position:0%
anyway yeah um so thank you so much my
 
05:15:23.590 --> 05:15:23.600 align:start position:0%
name is Amanda Elizabeth tol and I um
 
05:15:25.310 --> 05:15:25.320 align:start position:0%
this is I've served on this committee
 
05:15:28.548 --> 05:15:28.558 align:start position:0%
for three years and um I've testified at
 
05:15:30.230 --> 05:15:30.240 align:start position:0%
many hearings before but this is
 
05:15:32.548 --> 05:15:32.558 align:start position:0%
actually my first time testifying
 
05:15:34.510 --> 05:15:34.520 align:start position:0%
without having a written statement and
 
05:15:36.350 --> 05:15:36.360 align:start position:0%
thinking I was going to testify and
 
05:15:39.110 --> 05:15:39.120 align:start position:0%
testifying on the spot and I just feel
 
05:15:43.230 --> 05:15:43.240 align:start position:0%
it's so important to speak to this issue
 
05:15:46.788 --> 05:15:46.798 align:start position:0%
um and to humanize this issue because
 
05:15:50.910 --> 05:15:50.920 align:start position:0%
it's a one where people have very very
 
05:15:53.390 --> 05:15:53.400 align:start position:0%
strong feelings and it's very easy to
 
05:15:55.868 --> 05:15:55.878 align:start position:0%
judge I think until you've walked in
 
05:15:58.868 --> 05:15:58.878 align:start position:0%
someone's shoes and so I was moved by
 
05:16:03.070 --> 05:16:03.080 align:start position:0%
the last speaker and um Wanted to add to
 
05:16:07.270 --> 05:16:07.280 align:start position:0%
that so um I grew up in Manchester New
 
05:16:10.548 --> 05:16:10.558 align:start position:0%
Hampshire in a Jewish Family I went to
 
05:16:13.948 --> 05:16:13.958 align:start position:0%
marac Valley Hebrew Elementary School um
 
05:16:15.590 --> 05:16:15.600 align:start position:0%
my family played a critical role in the
 
05:16:18.030 --> 05:16:18.040 align:start position:0%
founding of Temple Israel in Manchester
 
05:16:20.310 --> 05:16:20.320 align:start position:0%
I went to Camp gone Israel with Rabbi
 
05:16:23.350 --> 05:16:23.360 align:start position:0%
krinsky who's LED um the prayer here in
 
05:16:27.670 --> 05:16:27.680 align:start position:0%
the past and um I consider myself a
 
05:16:31.270 --> 05:16:31.280 align:start position:0%
woman of faith and when I was a teenager
 
05:16:33.750 --> 05:16:33.760 align:start position:0%
I had an unplanned
 
05:16:37.990 --> 05:16:38.000 align:start position:0%
pregnancy and it was a hard decision but
 
05:16:40.670 --> 05:16:40.680 align:start position:0%
it was the right decision for me to
 
05:16:44.070 --> 05:16:44.080 align:start position:0%
terminate that pregnancy I ended up
 
05:16:47.628 --> 05:16:47.638 align:start position:0%
going on to college graduate school I
 
05:16:49.470 --> 05:16:49.480 align:start position:0%
got a Masters in
 
05:16:52.110 --> 05:16:52.120 align:start position:0%
Education um I was uh the Harold
 
05:16:55.628 --> 05:16:55.638 align:start position:0%
grinspoon 2010 recipient of the Jewish
 
05:16:58.470 --> 05:16:58.480 align:start position:0%
educator of the Year award which is a
 
05:17:01.070 --> 05:17:01.080 align:start position:0%
very prestigious award in the Jewish
 
05:17:04.190 --> 05:17:04.200 align:start position:0%
community Community um for my work
 
05:17:07.868 --> 05:17:07.878 align:start position:0%
teaching social studies and um now I'm
 
05:17:11.230 --> 05:17:11.240 align:start position:0%
expecting my third baby I brought my son
 
05:17:14.310 --> 05:17:14.320 align:start position:0%
Jordy um who everyone on this committee
 
05:17:18.070 --> 05:17:18.080 align:start position:0%
knows very well um to every um day of
 
05:17:21.510 --> 05:17:21.520 align:start position:0%
session last year I didn't miss a single
 
05:17:24.830 --> 05:17:24.840 align:start position:0%
day of um session he came with me from
 
05:17:29.868 --> 05:17:29.878 align:start position:0%
when he was a week old and um I I so
 
05:17:31.430 --> 05:17:31.440 align:start position:0%
some of my colleagues have asked like
 
05:17:34.230 --> 05:17:34.240 align:start position:0%
does this matter and I would say it does
 
05:17:36.390 --> 05:17:36.400 align:start position:0%
matter because it's standing in
 
05:17:39.230 --> 05:17:39.240 align:start position:0%
solidarity with people who have needed
 
05:17:43.708 --> 05:17:43.718 align:start position:0%
this care and I can't emphasize enough
 
05:17:46.868 --> 05:17:46.878 align:start position:0%
how important that is with this Critical
 
05:17:50.030 --> 05:17:50.040 align:start position:0%
Care being under
 
05:17:50.040 --> 05:17:51.708 align:start position:0%
Care being under
attack

05:17:51.708 --> 05:17:51.718 align:start position:0%
attack
 
05:17:56.310 --> 05:17:56.320 align:start position:0%
and we know that Granite sters
 
05:18:00.310 --> 05:18:00.320 align:start position:0%
regardless of political party and
 
05:18:04.590 --> 05:18:04.600 align:start position:0%
persuasion are overwhelmingly pro-choice
 
05:18:06.548 --> 05:18:06.558 align:start position:0%
and I think in large part that's because
 
05:18:10.070 --> 05:18:10.080 align:start position:0%
everyone knows and loves someone who has
 
05:18:15.628 --> 05:18:15.638 align:start position:0%
needed this care last week I was at a
 
05:18:18.230 --> 05:18:18.240 align:start position:0%
different um hearing that related to
 
05:18:21.590 --> 05:18:21.600 align:start position:0%
abortion and one of um my Republican
 
05:18:23.990 --> 05:18:24.000 align:start position:0%
colleagues who she doesn't agree with me
 
05:18:26.990 --> 05:18:27.000 align:start position:0%
on anything like guns and we have very
 
05:18:30.430 --> 05:18:30.440 align:start position:0%
different opinions on political issues
 
05:18:33.350 --> 05:18:33.360 align:start position:0%
but she got up and she shared her story
 
05:18:36.310 --> 05:18:36.320 align:start position:0%
um and offered a republican pro-choice
 
05:18:39.270 --> 05:18:39.280 align:start position:0%
perspective um recently in the Keen
 
05:18:41.868 --> 05:18:41.878 align:start position:0%
Sentinel we saw um a letter to the
 
05:18:45.510 --> 05:18:45.520 align:start position:0%
editor by John winter um who was the
 
05:18:48.470 --> 05:18:48.480 align:start position:0%
former Vice chair of the Walpole
 
05:18:51.350 --> 05:18:51.360 align:start position:0%
Republicans and um was the Republican
 
05:18:53.590 --> 05:18:53.600 align:start position:0%
candidate for Walpole saying his
 
05:18:57.190 --> 05:18:57.200 align:start position:0%
pro-choice stance and I
 
05:19:01.470 --> 05:19:01.480 align:start position:0%
just think that this issue it trans
 
05:19:05.948 --> 05:19:05.958 align:start position:0%
sends party lines because this is about
 
05:19:08.470 --> 05:19:08.480 align:start position:0%
our private medical decisions this is
 
05:19:10.230 --> 05:19:10.240 align:start position:0%
about our freedom our civil liberties
 
05:19:12.910 --> 05:19:12.920 align:start position:0%
the sanctity of the patient provider
 
05:19:17.548 --> 05:19:17.558 align:start position:0%
relationship and so um I am asking you
 
05:19:20.030 --> 05:19:20.040 align:start position:0%
my colleagues to please support hcr1
 
05:19:23.150 --> 05:19:23.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:25.510 --> 05:19:25.520 align:start position:0%
much would you take any questions if

for the State of New Hampshire and it's
 
05:38:13.628 --> 05:38:13.638 align:start position:0%

05:39:55.830 --> 05:39:55.840 align:start position:0%
vote for
 
05:39:58.430 --> 05:39:58.440 align:start position:0%
itl uh representative toll typically as
 
05:40:00.868 --> 05:40:00.878 align:start position:0%
you probably know being a veteran of
 
05:40:04.868 --> 05:40:04.878 align:start position:0%
this committee um the person who makes a
 
05:40:08.590 --> 05:40:08.600 align:start position:0%
a motion oftentimes does a report uh can
 
05:40:12.390 --> 05:40:12.400 align:start position:0%
we look to you for that sure okay or we
 
05:40:14.190 --> 05:40:14.200 align:start position:0%
can we'll figure that out but uh
 
05:40:17.590 --> 05:40:17.600 align:start position:0%
speaking of reports uh be there is a a
 
05:40:19.788 --> 05:40:19.798 align:start position:0%
recommendation from the U from
 
05:40:21.750 --> 05:40:21.760 align:start position:0%
leadership that before anybody leaves
 
05:40:23.590 --> 05:40:23.600 align:start position:0%
who has a report that they give it to
 
05:40:25.990 --> 05:40:26.000 align:start position:0%
the chair that's not how I'm going to do
 
05:40:28.310 --> 05:40:28.320 align:start position:0%
business especially on a Friday
 
05:40:30.510 --> 05:40:30.520 align:start position:0%
afternoon I would ask that whoever is
 
05:40:32.510 --> 05:40:32.520 align:start position:0%
doing reports I have several be doing
 
05:40:34.868 --> 05:40:34.878 align:start position:0%
myself I suspect uh if you could get
 
05:40:38.350 --> 05:40:38.360 align:start position:0%
them to me electronically by uh Sunday
 
05:40:42.830 --> 05:40:42.840 align:start position:0%
evening say uh 1800 hours 6 o'clock okay
 
05:40:42.840 --> 05:40:43.788 align:start position:0%
evening say uh 1800 hours 6 o'clock okay
is

05:40:43.788 --> 05:40:43.798 align:start position:0%
is
 
05:40:46.110 --> 05:40:46.120 align:start position:0%
that representative toll gives a big
 
05:40:48.230 --> 05:40:48.240 align:start position:0%
thumbs up and so that sounds like we got
 
05:40:52.070 --> 05:40:52.080 align:start position:0%
a plan all right uh next uh consent on
 
05:40:55.948 --> 05:40:55.958 align:start position:0%
that uh consent um is there any
 
05:40:58.310 --> 05:40:58.320 align:start position:0%
objection to consent sometimes on
 
05:41:00.190 --> 05:41:00.200 align:start position:0%
resolution this is not resolution it was
 
05:41:04.110 --> 05:41:04.120 align:start position:0%
a cacr uh sometimes in resolutions they
 
05:41:07.628 --> 05:41:07.638 align:start position:0%
have to go to the full body but um I
 
05:41:10.948 --> 05:41:10.958 align:start position:0%
believe consent works on a cacr or it I
 
05:41:11.750 --> 05:41:11.760 align:start position:0%
may have to check with the
 
05:41:14.628 --> 05:41:14.638 align:start position:0%
parliamentarian on that cacr may have to
 
05:41:17.548 --> 05:41:17.558 align:start position:0%
come to a floor vote I will check uh put
 
05:41:21.070 --> 05:41:21.080 align:start position:0%
that on consent uh
 
05:41:22.910 --> 05:41:22.920 align:start position:0%
representative okay representative bone
 
05:41:24.590 --> 05:41:24.600 align:start position:0%
says let them worry about it for the
 
05:41:26.750 --> 05:41:26.760 align:start position:0%
record all right so it's not consent
 
05:41:29.910 --> 05:41:29.920 align:start position:0%
barring uh a uh
 
05:41:29.920 --> 05:41:31.628 align:start position:0%
barring uh a uh
parliamentary

05:41:31.628 --> 05:41:31.638 align:start position:0%
parliamentary
 
05:41:34.948 --> 05:41:34.958 align:start position:0%
requirement okay HB 1130 that is the
 
05:41:37.510 --> 05:41:37.520 align:start position:0%

order that I want to
 
05:42:28.468 --> 05:42:28.478 align:start position:0%
because he's the boss and and part of
 
05:42:30.910 --> 05:42:30.920 align:start position:0%
the reason for that that is uh some of

ones that that perhaps might be easier
done

05:42:38.270 --> 05:42:38.280 align:start position:0%

05:43:03.310 --> 05:43:03.320 align:start position:0%
is 11:30 is uh H it's a bill HB 1130 as
 
05:43:05.990 --> 05:43:06.000 align:start position:0%
I said this is on the uh the measure to
 
05:43:09.150 --> 05:43:09.160 align:start position:0%
to establish a commission to look at the
 
05:43:11.350 --> 05:43:11.360 align:start position:0%
secession Dynamics for New Hampshire
 
05:43:16.350 --> 05:43:16.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:19.310 --> 05:43:19.320 align:start position:0%
massamilla i' like to itl okay
 
05:43:21.990 --> 05:43:22.000 align:start position:0%
representative uh massam Miller motions
 
05:43:24.628 --> 05:43:24.638 align:start position:0%
itl in expedient to Liber uh to to
 
05:43:29.548 --> 05:43:29.558 align:start position:0%
liberate to uh legislate on hb130 and do
 
05:43:30.830 --> 05:43:30.840 align:start position:0%
we have a
 
05:43:33.548 --> 05:43:33.558 align:start position:0%
second represent philio thank you uh for
 
05:43:36.350 --> 05:43:36.360 align:start position:0%
that second represent filio am I saying
 
05:43:39.110 --> 05:43:39.120 align:start position:0%
that correctly representative yes thank
 
05:43:43.230 --> 05:43:43.240 align:start position:0%
you uh so representative Mass do you
 
05:43:57.990 --> 05:43:58.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:00.910 --> 05:44:00.920 align:start position:0%
1130 and the second on that again was
 
05:44:03.948 --> 05:44:03.958 align:start position:0%
representative philio uh would you like
 
05:44:05.750 --> 05:44:05.760 align:start position:0%
to speak to your
 
05:44:08.510 --> 05:44:08.520 align:start position:0%
second sure uh as I mentioned in the
 
05:44:09.830 --> 05:44:09.840 align:start position:0%
hearings on this I think that the state
 
05:44:11.628 --> 05:44:11.638 align:start position:0%
lacks the power to consider this anyhow
 
05:44:13.310 --> 05:44:13.320 align:start position:0%
given uh previous Supreme Court
 
05:44:15.670 --> 05:44:15.680 align:start position:0%
president and since the state likely
 
05:44:17.230 --> 05:44:17.240 align:start position:0%
doesn't have the power to secede
 
05:44:18.750 --> 05:44:18.760 align:start position:0%
regardless of what the study commission
 
05:44:23.150 --> 05:44:23.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:25.110 --> 05:44:25.120 align:start position:0%
anyhow thank
 
05:44:28.628 --> 05:44:28.638 align:start position:0%
you okay other comments uh anything else
 
05:44:31.350 --> 05:44:31.360 align:start position:0%
uh representative Manion go ahead yeah
 
05:44:32.868 --> 05:44:32.878 align:start position:0%
uh so the one thing I would say is like
 
05:44:34.868 --> 05:44:34.878 align:start position:0%
when this measure the secession has come
 
05:44:35.910 --> 05:44:35.920 align:start position:0%
before the committee before a lot of
 
05:44:36.670 --> 05:44:36.680 align:start position:0%
people was like there's a lot of
 
05:44:38.510 --> 05:44:38.520 align:start position:0%
unanswered questions so I understand the
 
05:44:39.830 --> 05:44:39.840 align:start position:0%
message behind the bill it's like well
 
05:44:40.868 --> 05:44:40.878 align:start position:0%
if you have a lot of unanswered
 
05:44:42.750 --> 05:44:42.760 align:start position:0%
questions form a committee and figure it
 
05:44:45.350 --> 05:44:45.360 align:start position:0%
out but I'm that's just my input on
 
05:44:48.070 --> 05:44:48.080 align:start position:0%
this thank you I saw their intent as
 
05:44:51.910 --> 05:44:51.920 align:start position:0%

we will take up in exact session is HCR
 
05:46:24.310 --> 05:46:24.320 align:start position:0%
house concurrent resolution 10 and that
 
05:46:28.868 --> 05:46:28.878 align:start position:0%
has to do with u the resolution asking
 
05:46:33.190 --> 05:46:33.200 align:start position:0%
calling calling for uh Washington to pay
 
05:46:36.030 --> 05:46:36.040 align:start position:0%
the share of special ed cost that they
 
05:46:40.310 --> 05:46:40.320 align:start position:0%
were expected to pay uh based on earlier
 
05:46:42.230 --> 05:46:42.240 align:start position:0%
promises and legislation but be before
 
05:46:45.230 --> 05:46:45.240 align:start position:0%
we look for a a motion I see
 
05:46:48.030 --> 05:46:48.040 align:start position:0%
representative Pani hand up thank you Mr
 
05:46:49.590 --> 05:46:49.600 align:start position:0%
chair I was listening to the recordings
 
05:46:51.390 --> 05:46:51.400 align:start position:0%
for these if you don't use the
 
05:46:54.190 --> 05:46:54.200 align:start position:0%
microphones you can't hear your vote
 
05:46:56.390 --> 05:46:56.400 align:start position:0%
okay so just keep that in mind I would
 
05:47:00.628 --> 05:47:00.638 align:start position:0%
think that might that would be helpful
 
05:47:02.590 --> 05:47:02.600 align:start position:0%
so when you're making your motions or
 
05:47:05.390 --> 05:47:05.400 align:start position:0%
when you're speaking if you could uh
 
05:47:08.030 --> 05:47:08.040 align:start position:0%
because uh this is public we want people
 
05:47:11.750 --> 05:47:11.760 align:start position:0%
to be able to hear your yay or nay thank
 
05:47:14.190 --> 05:47:14.200 align:start position:0%

05:47:18.110 --> 05:47:18.120 align:start position:0%
pman so back to hcr1 DC funding for

special ed that again uh we all have the
 
05:47:23.390 --> 05:47:23.400 align:start position:0%
measure in front of us or in our folders
 
05:47:26.310 --> 05:47:26.320 align:start position:0%
that was the resolution calling on uh
 
05:47:30.110 --> 05:47:30.120 align:start position:0%
the feds F federal government to pay the
 
05:47:32.788 --> 05:47:32.798 align:start position:0%
share of special ed funding that they
 
05:47:35.190 --> 05:47:35.200 align:start position:0%
had indicated that they would long
 
05:47:38.548 --> 05:47:38.558 align:start position:0%
ago uh representative Massa Miller uh I
 
05:47:39.830 --> 05:47:39.840 align:start position:0%
have a note here that you may have a
 
05:47:44.110 --> 05:47:44.120 align:start position:0%
motion yes I do I recommend a to
 
05:47:47.110 --> 05:47:47.120 align:start position:0%
pass okay the motion from representative
 
05:47:50.230 --> 05:47:50.240 align:start position:0%
Massa Miller is OTP ought to pass on
 
05:47:55.030 --> 05:47:55.040 align:start position:0%
acr10 and looking for a second from
 
05:48:00.230 --> 05:48:00.240 align:start position:0%
second second is from uh represent car
 
05:48:02.270 --> 05:48:02.280 align:start position:0%
uh okay rip and Miller would you care to
 
05:48:05.708 --> 05:48:05.718 align:start position:0%
speak to your OTP motion yes I would on
 
05:48:08.070 --> 05:48:08.080 align:start position:0%
a personal note I was an elementary
 
05:48:10.190 --> 05:48:10.200 align:start position:0%
teacher and a High School varsity
 
05:48:13.788 --> 05:48:13.798 align:start position:0%
basketball coach for several years and
 
05:48:17.390 --> 05:48:17.400 align:start position:0%
um I know what happens when you have a
 
05:48:20.468 --> 05:48:20.478 align:start position:0%
family that moves in with five children
 
05:48:23.390 --> 05:48:23.400 align:start position:0%
three of whom are and this is midy year
 
05:48:27.310 --> 05:48:27.320 align:start position:0%
and three of them have a spe special ed
 
05:48:30.430 --> 05:48:30.440 align:start position:0%
um itinerary and two of those were moved
 
05:48:33.030 --> 05:48:33.040 align:start position:0%
out of state for their special ed
 
05:48:36.350 --> 05:48:36.360 align:start position:0%
services and that absolutely devastates
 
05:48:39.788 --> 05:48:39.798 align:start position:0%
a local school board budget so that's
 
05:48:41.990 --> 05:48:42.000 align:start position:0%
why I'm voting on to pass because the
 
05:48:44.548 --> 05:48:44.558 align:start position:0%
government had agreed years ago they
 
05:48:47.230 --> 05:48:47.240 align:start position:0%
were going to contribute 40% to special
 
05:48:50.310 --> 05:48:50.320 align:start position:0%
ed and they have not um fulfilled their
 
05:48:52.948 --> 05:48:52.958 align:start position:0%
obligation I think it's time we put them
 
05:48:55.310 --> 05:48:55.320 align:start position:0%
on notice thank
 
05:48:57.430 --> 05:48:57.440 align:start position:0%
you representative K you were on a
 
05:49:00.110 --> 05:49:00.120 align:start position:0%
school board uh is the person who made
 
05:49:02.590 --> 05:49:02.600 align:start position:0%
the second do you want to uh speak to
 
05:49:04.468 --> 05:49:04.478 align:start position:0%
your second oh ju just briefly I've
 
05:49:06.548 --> 05:49:06.558 align:start position:0%
spent 18 years on a public school board
 
05:49:09.190 --> 05:49:09.200 align:start position:0%
s years on a charter school board uh
 
05:49:11.990 --> 05:49:12.000 align:start position:0%
roughly 25% of our population is special
 
05:49:14.788 --> 05:49:14.798 align:start position:0%
ed the government funds roughly 16% of
 
05:49:18.190 --> 05:49:18.200 align:start position:0%
the 40% they promised to provide so
 
05:49:22.030 --> 05:49:22.040 align:start position:0%
there is a a gap and I hope they will
 
05:49:26.030 --> 05:49:26.040 align:start position:0%
honor their agreement and fill that
 
05:49:28.990 --> 05:49:29.000 align:start position:0%
Gap I'm thank you representative other

05:51:42.430 --> 05:51:42.440 align:start position:0%
that's the resolution in support of
 
05:51:43.990 --> 05:51:44.000 align:start position:0%
Taiwan that happens to be the one that I
 
05:51:48.030 --> 05:51:48.040 align:start position:0%
was the uh sponsor for or the sponsor of
 
05:51:50.910 --> 05:51:50.920 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm going to make an OTP motion on
 
05:51:52.830 --> 05:51:52.840 align:start position:0%
on my own
 
05:51:54.910 --> 05:51:54.920 align:start position:0%
resolution I'll second
 
05:51:57.948 --> 05:51:57.958 align:start position:0%
it thank you representative Rollins uh I
 
05:52:00.628 --> 05:52:00.638 align:start position:0%
will speak to it
 
05:52:03.390 --> 05:52:03.400 align:start position:0%
um uh those of you in committee uh heard
 
05:52:05.070 --> 05:52:05.080 align:start position:0%
me or if you were not here you had the
 
05:52:08.548 --> 05:52:08.558 align:start position:0%
chance to look at the uh the Youtube and
 
05:52:11.430 --> 05:52:11.440 align:start position:0%
uh this resolution of support simply uh
 
05:52:14.430 --> 05:52:14.440 align:start position:0%
listed the reasons why I felt or many of
 
05:52:17.868 --> 05:52:17.878 align:start position:0%
us feel that Taiwan uh needs to know
 
05:52:20.190 --> 05:52:20.200 align:start position:0%
that uh there are people that are
 
05:52:22.830 --> 05:52:22.840 align:start position:0%
keeping an eye on what's happening in
 
05:52:25.708 --> 05:52:25.718 align:start position:0%
East Asia uh Taiwan just is perhaps the
 
05:52:28.230 --> 05:52:28.240 align:start position:0%
most vibrant freest democracy in East
 
05:52:30.948 --> 05:52:30.958 align:start position:0%
East Asia they just had an election last
 
05:52:33.190 --> 05:52:33.200 align:start position:0%
Saturday uh a free
 
05:52:37.430 --> 05:52:37.440 align:start position:0%
election and uh besides the the the idea
 
05:52:39.750 --> 05:52:39.760 align:start position:0%
or the notion that we want to support
 
05:52:44.830 --> 05:52:44.840 align:start position:0%
democracy um there's also uh profound um
 
05:52:47.830 --> 05:52:47.840 align:start position:0%
economic reasons with the the microchip
 
05:52:49.270 --> 05:52:49.280 align:start position:0%
issue and the trade issue and I
 
05:52:51.468 --> 05:52:51.478 align:start position:0%
mentioned uh we do a New Hampshire does
 
05:52:55.070 --> 05:52:55.080 align:start position:0%
a quarter of a billion dollar uh trade
 
05:52:57.350 --> 05:52:57.360 align:start position:0%
um business with Taiwan so anyway those
 
05:52:59.190 --> 05:52:59.200 align:start position:0%
are some of the highlights from my
 
05:53:01.708 --> 05:53:01.718 align:start position:0%
testimony uh and I I hope the committee
 
05:53:04.350 --> 05:53:04.360 align:start position:0%
will join me in in uh supporting this
 
05:53:06.468 --> 05:53:06.478 align:start position:0%
resolution of support for the Republic
 
05:53:07.830 --> 05:53:07.840 align:start position:0%
of China
 
05:53:10.350 --> 05:53:10.360 align:start position:0%
Taiwan uh representative Rollins you you
 
05:53:12.868 --> 05:53:12.878 align:start position:0%
did second that uh would you care to
 
05:53:15.390 --> 05:53:15.400 align:start position:0%
speak to your second no I think this is
 
05:53:17.390 --> 05:53:17.400 align:start position:0%
pretty cut and dry thank
 
05:53:20.750 --> 05:53:20.760 align:start position:0%
you uh other uh comments questions uh
 
05:53:23.070 --> 05:53:23.080 align:start position:0%
okay representative bone yeah thank you
 
05:53:25.270 --> 05:53:25.280 align:start position:0%
um right now the
 
05:53:28.150 --> 05:53:28.160 align:start position:0%
Taiwanese consider them 80% of the
 
05:53:31.030 --> 05:53:31.040 align:start position:0%
Taiwanese consider themselves Taiwanese
 
05:53:33.430 --> 05:53:33.440 align:start position:0%
they don't consider themselves Chinese
 
05:53:37.708 --> 05:53:37.718 align:start position:0%
anymore so I think why we should support
 
05:53:40.310 --> 05:53:40.320 align:start position:0%
this thank you representative uh
 
05:53:42.788 --> 05:53:42.798 align:start position:0%
representative Manion I I support the
 
05:53:44.788 --> 05:53:44.798 align:start position:0%
democracy and I love the free trade I
 
05:53:46.628 --> 05:53:46.638 align:start position:0%
just don't if they come under attack I
 
05:53:48.150 --> 05:53:48.160 align:start position:0%
do not think we should be committing
 
05:53:51.830 --> 05:53:51.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:55.110 --> 05:53:55.120 align:start position:0%
defense okay other comments questions
 
05:53:55.120 --> 05:53:56.230 align:start position:0%
defense okay other comments questions
representative

05:53:56.230 --> 05:53:56.240 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:53:58.350 --> 05:53:58.360 align:start position:0%
filio this is going to be a conf
 
05:54:00.030 --> 05:54:00.040 align:start position:0%
statement but I agree with all of the
 
05:54:01.190 --> 05:54:01.200 align:start position:0%
statements that have been previously
 
05:54:03.868 --> 05:54:03.878 align:start position:0%
made and I will be voting no simply
 
05:54:04.990 --> 05:54:05.000 align:start position:0%
because I don't believe that the state
 
05:54:07.430 --> 05:54:07.440 align:start position:0%
should be involved uh in international
 
05:54:09.190 --> 05:54:09.200 align:start position:0%
matters and should be expressing support
 
05:54:11.590 --> 05:54:11.600 align:start position:0%
on International matters either way it
 
05:54:12.788 --> 05:54:12.798 align:start position:0%
is simply an expression of what I think
 
05:54:14.990 --> 05:54:15.000 align:start position:0%
the limits of state power is rather than
 
05:54:17.350 --> 05:54:17.360 align:start position:0%
reg an opinion on Taiwan one way or the
 
05:54:19.110 --> 05:54:19.120 align:start position:0%
another fully support actually the
 
05:54:20.868 --> 05:54:20.878 align:start position:0%
statements have been made but I think we
 
05:54:23.150 --> 05:54:23.160 align:start position:0%
need to be cognizant of what state power
 
05:54:25.590 --> 05:54:25.600 align:start position:0%
is thank you representative uh
 
05:54:28.468 --> 05:54:28.478 align:start position:0%

submitted by representative levit it's
 
05:58:58.990 --> 05:58:59.000 align:start position:0%
uh um
 
05:59:03.230 --> 05:59:03.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:03.240 --> 05:59:04.868 align:start position:0%
 
0192

05:59:04.868 --> 05:59:04.878 align:start position:0%
0192
 
05:59:07.468 --> 05:59:07.478 align:start position:0%
H uh representative L would you care to
 
05:59:10.190 --> 05:59:10.200 align:start position:0%
speak to your proposed amendment yes
 
05:59:12.868 --> 05:59:12.878 align:start position:0%
thank you chair so I would like the
 
05:59:15.350 --> 05:59:15.360 align:start position:0%
committee to adopt the amendment to the
 
05:59:18.110 --> 05:59:18.120 align:start position:0%
original Bill HB
 
05:59:21.070 --> 05:59:21.080 align:start position:0%
11179 clearly states that any spouse or
 
05:59:24.430 --> 05:59:24.440 align:start position:0%
unmarried surviving spouse of a retired
 
05:59:27.350 --> 05:59:27.360 align:start position:0%
member of the Armed Forces will have
 
05:59:32.030 --> 05:59:32.040 align:start position:0%
access access to um State um parks and
 
05:59:42.670 --> 05:59:42.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:45.190 --> 05:59:45.200 align:start position:0%
residency is there a is there do we have
 
05:59:48.590 --> 05:59:48.600 align:start position:0%
a second for that okay so the amendment
 
05:59:51.030 --> 05:59:51.040 align:start position:0%
was submitted by representative levit he
 
05:59:53.310 --> 05:59:53.320 align:start position:0%
just spoke to it uh representative pman
 
05:59:57.070 --> 05:59:57.080 align:start position:0%
seconded it uh I have a a question on
 
05:59:58.150 --> 05:59:58.160 align:start position:0%
the C
 
06:00:00.548 --> 06:00:00.558 align:start position:0%
uh the amendment doesn't address this
 
06:00:02.910 --> 06:00:02.920 align:start position:0%
would involve an increased
 
06:00:07.230 --> 06:00:07.240 align:start position:0%
cost or loss of revenue for the state
 
06:00:09.270 --> 06:00:09.280 align:start position:0%
did did you get an estimate of what that
 
06:00:13.430 --> 06:00:13.440 align:start position:0%
might add up to so after careful
 
06:00:17.628 --> 06:00:17.638 align:start position:0%
consideration um in not being able to
 
06:00:22.468 --> 06:00:22.478 align:start position:0%
estimate correctly the cost of having a
 
06:00:22.478 --> 06:00:24.150 align:start position:0%
estimate correctly the cost of having a
Massachusetts

06:00:24.150 --> 06:00:24.160 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts
 
06:00:27.990 --> 06:00:28.000 align:start position:0%
resident use have access we decide to go
 
06:00:31.150 --> 06:00:31.160 align:start position:0%
with strictly a New Hampshire resident
 
06:00:33.390 --> 06:00:33.400 align:start position:0%
and that came up to
 
06:00:37.548 --> 06:00:37.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:42.510 --> 06:00:42.520 align:start position:0%
$5,600 thank thank you so the the C the
 
06:00:44.310 --> 06:00:44.320 align:start position:0%
cost in terms of loss Revenue was
 
06:00:48.548 --> 06:00:48.558 align:start position:0%
estimated you said 5600 5600 yes that's
 
06:00:51.190 --> 06:00:51.200 align:start position:0%
correct okay thank thank you for for
 
06:00:54.468 --> 06:00:54.478 align:start position:0%
providing that ref and Pimon uh
 
06:00:57.030 --> 06:00:57.040 align:start position:0%
seconding motion do you have anything to
 
06:00:59.110 --> 06:00:59.120 align:start position:0%
add or
 
06:01:01.548 --> 06:01:01.558 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker I yeah I just think
 
06:01:03.868 --> 06:01:03.878 align:start position:0%
it's a a good gesture to include the
 
06:01:06.390 --> 06:01:06.400 align:start position:0%
spous I know if I didn't include my
 
06:01:09.788 --> 06:01:09.798 align:start position:0%
spouse I would be somewhere
 
06:01:12.230 --> 06:01:12.240 align:start position:0%
else like on that couch or something you
 
06:01:15.830 --> 06:01:15.840 align:start position:0%
know but um I I just go for I think it's
 
06:01:18.030 --> 06:01:18.040 align:start position:0%
a great idea thank you representative
 
06:01:20.350 --> 06:01:20.360 align:start position:0%
representative shortliffe thank you Mr
 
06:01:22.590 --> 06:01:22.600 align:start position:0%
chairman with all due respect to the
 
06:01:25.270 --> 06:01:25.280 align:start position:0%
sponsor uh I'm going to vote against
 
06:01:27.670 --> 06:01:27.680 align:start position:0%
this um I think it's similar to our New
 
06:01:29.548 --> 06:01:29.558 align:start position:0%
Hampshire veterans license plates and
 
06:01:31.230 --> 06:01:31.240 align:start position:0%
that's always been a bone of contention
 
06:01:33.270 --> 06:01:33.280 align:start position:0%
because when the veteran dies the
 
06:01:35.708 --> 06:01:35.718 align:start position:0%
surviving spouse has to give up that
 
06:01:38.030 --> 06:01:38.040 align:start position:0%
plate and I think it's something of this
 
06:01:40.390 --> 06:01:40.400 align:start position:0%
magnitude uh I'd rather have the member
 
06:01:42.230 --> 06:01:42.240 align:start position:0%
bring it back as a bill in the next
 
06:01:44.468 --> 06:01:44.478 align:start position:0%
session so it can be invited by the full
 
06:01:47.868 --> 06:01:47.878 align:start position:0%
committee before we make a decision of I
 
06:01:49.190 --> 06:01:49.200 align:start position:0%
support the bill but I think the
 
06:01:51.788 --> 06:01:51.798 align:start position:0%
amendment um tic come back is a bill on
 
06:01:54.830 --> 06:01:54.840 align:start position:0%
its own thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
06:01:56.708 --> 06:01:56.718 align:start position:0%
representative question representative
 
06:01:59.830 --> 06:01:59.840 align:start position:0%
rung yes thank you Mr chair um I I have
 
06:02:01.468 --> 06:02:01.478 align:start position:0%
two questions actually one on the
 
06:02:04.510 --> 06:02:04.520 align:start position:0%
amendment um are children included of
 
06:02:06.990 --> 06:02:07.000 align:start position:0%
retired military or is it just
 
06:02:13.150 --> 06:02:13.160 align:start position:0%
spouses no again the um estimated cost
 
06:02:16.150 --> 06:02:16.160 align:start position:0%
um could not be correctly
 
06:02:20.310 --> 06:02:20.320 align:start position:0%
formulated and in order to get this done
 
06:02:26.350 --> 06:02:26.360 align:start position:0%
we figure the spouse is uh the most
 
06:02:29.430 --> 06:02:29.440 align:start position:0%
accessible individual to the
 
06:02:33.590 --> 06:02:33.600 align:start position:0%
retirement uh to the retired um
 
06:02:35.590 --> 06:02:35.600 align:start position:0%
Personnel okay so children aren't
 
06:02:38.708 --> 06:02:38.718 align:start position:0%
included then recovery no they're not
 
06:02:41.310 --> 06:02:41.320 align:start position:0%
okay um and then um Mr chair one other
 
06:02:43.948 --> 06:02:43.958 align:start position:0%
question um I serve on the resources
 
06:02:47.110 --> 06:02:47.120 align:start position:0%
Recreation and development committee and
 
06:02:49.910 --> 06:02:49.920 align:start position:0%
um we we have heard all the bills
 
06:02:51.708 --> 06:02:51.718 align:start position:0%
regarding State Park fees I was
 
06:02:53.468 --> 06:02:53.478 align:start position:0%
wondering is this going to that
 
06:02:55.910 --> 06:02:55.920 align:start position:0%
committee question was would the second
 
06:02:58.070 --> 06:02:58.080 align:start position:0%
committee for this be rrd
 
06:03:00.910 --> 06:03:00.920 align:start position:0%
uh actually I I also wondered at one
 
06:03:02.548 --> 06:03:02.558 align:start position:0%
point early on why this did not go to
 
06:03:04.670 --> 06:03:04.680 align:start position:0%
rrd but I think it's because it's it's a
 
06:03:07.150 --> 06:03:07.160 align:start position:0%
veteran related uh measure so it came to
 
06:03:11.350 --> 06:03:11.360 align:start position:0%
the veterans committee um I do not
 
06:03:13.628 --> 06:03:13.638 align:start position:0%
anticipate it going to
 
06:03:16.750 --> 06:03:16.760 align:start position:0%
rrd uh leadership could make it could go
 
06:03:19.750 --> 06:03:19.760 align:start position:0%
to finance uh because there is a small
 
06:03:22.350 --> 06:03:22.360 align:start position:0%
Financial component so to the best of my
 
06:03:24.390 --> 06:03:24.400 align:start position:0%
knowledge at this time uh I do not see
 
06:03:28.510 --> 06:03:28.520 align:start position:0%
it going to ird um it may go to finance
 
06:03:30.190 --> 06:03:30.200 align:start position:0%
uh but that's a call leadership would
 
06:03:33.708 --> 06:03:33.718 align:start position:0%
make uh Mr Speaker amus do you have any
 
06:03:36.468 --> 06:03:36.478 align:start position:0%
thoughts on that um it could go to a
 
06:03:38.190 --> 06:03:38.200 align:start position:0%
second I think you'd know by now if it
 
06:03:40.670 --> 06:03:40.680 align:start position:0%
was a second committee Bill and as far
 
06:03:42.430 --> 06:03:42.440 align:start position:0%
as going to finance normally the
 
06:03:45.190 --> 06:03:45.200 align:start position:0%
threshold is at least 10,000 uh cost to
 
06:03:47.430 --> 06:03:47.440 align:start position:0%
the state so I think Finance would wave
 
06:03:50.310 --> 06:03:50.320 align:start position:0%
it off if it should pass thank you for
 
06:03:53.030 --> 06:03:53.040 align:start position:0%
that um so that kind of answers the
 
06:03:55.628 --> 06:03:55.638 align:start position:0%
finance committee option not likely rrd
 
06:03:58.548 --> 06:03:58.558 align:start position:0%
I I don't haven't heard don't anticipate
 
06:04:02.030 --> 06:04:02.040 align:start position:0%
um that's a good question and uh if if
 
06:04:04.350 --> 06:04:04.360 align:start position:0%
the does if leadership does want it to
 
06:04:06.628 --> 06:04:06.638 align:start position:0%
go there they'll I'll I'll ask we'll
 
06:04:08.948 --> 06:04:08.958 align:start position:0%
find that out thank you Mr chair one
 
06:04:12.030 --> 06:04:12.040 align:start position:0%
other just a comment is the bills that
 
06:04:14.868 --> 06:04:14.878 align:start position:0%
we've heard um and every year we have
 
06:04:17.590 --> 06:04:17.600 align:start position:0%
bills where the state parks come in and
 
06:04:20.230 --> 06:04:20.240 align:start position:0%
and testify and they're operating on a
 
06:04:22.030 --> 06:04:22.040 align:start position:0%
shoestring right now I think actually
 
06:04:23.350 --> 06:04:23.360 align:start position:0%
they're in the red and they're supposed
 
06:04:26.548 --> 06:04:26.558 align:start position:0%
to be a self-sustaining division so um I
 
06:04:29.030 --> 06:04:29.040 align:start position:0%
am concerned concerned about any even
 
06:04:31.430 --> 06:04:31.440 align:start position:0%
though it seems like it's a low number
 
06:04:33.310 --> 06:04:33.320 align:start position:0%
um that's money that's going to come
 
06:04:35.788 --> 06:04:35.798 align:start position:0%
from somewhere else in their budget so I
 
06:04:37.390 --> 06:04:37.400 align:start position:0%
just want members to be aware of that
 
06:04:39.910 --> 06:04:39.920 align:start position:0%
when they're voting on this that it's
 
06:04:43.190 --> 06:04:43.200 align:start position:0%
it's a really feel-good bill um I I am
 
06:04:45.548 --> 06:04:45.558 align:start position:0%
the daughter of a man who uh spent his
 
06:04:48.190 --> 06:04:48.200 align:start position:0%
career in the military so I I understand
 
06:04:50.150 --> 06:04:50.160 align:start position:0%
the sacrifice that they make and their
 
06:04:53.030 --> 06:04:53.040 align:start position:0%
spouses make and their kids make too but
 
06:04:56.708 --> 06:04:56.718 align:start position:0%
um I think from a a finance perspective
 
06:04:58.548 --> 06:04:58.558 align:start position:0%
I I would have preferred if this goes to
 
06:05:01.390 --> 06:05:01.400 align:start position:0%
resources or or to a study where we
 
06:05:03.990 --> 06:05:04.000 align:start position:0%
could really look at the cost of this in
 
06:05:06.270 --> 06:05:06.280 align:start position:0%
relation to the entire Park's budget
 
06:05:09.910 --> 06:05:09.920 align:start position:0%
thank you like to comment on that U yes
 
06:05:13.670 --> 06:05:13.680 align:start position:0%
go ahead uh represent LE so this was
 
06:05:17.590 --> 06:05:17.600 align:start position:0%
brought up when we had um discussed the
 
06:05:21.628 --> 06:05:21.638 align:start position:0%
amendment and we were um able to squeeze
 
06:05:25.230 --> 06:05:25.240 align:start position:0%
it as much as possible as far as costs
 
06:05:29.628 --> 06:05:29.638 align:start position:0%
that's why there was no other
 
06:05:32.868 --> 06:05:32.878 align:start position:0%
um residents other than New Hampshire
 
06:05:36.788 --> 06:05:36.798 align:start position:0%
and also there were no children so I
 
06:05:41.350 --> 06:05:41.360 align:start position:0%
don't see the advantage of this um being
 
06:05:45.868 --> 06:05:45.878 align:start position:0%
um not OTP because it's always going to
 
06:05:49.948 --> 06:05:49.958 align:start position:0%
come down to what is the
 
06:05:53.310 --> 06:05:53.320 align:start position:0%
least effective and cost to get this
 
06:05:55.990 --> 06:05:56.000 align:start position:0%
done and this is what we came up
 
06:05:56.000 --> 06:05:58.190 align:start position:0%
done and this is what we came up
with

06:05:58.190 --> 06:05:58.200 align:start position:0%
with
 
06:06:00.750 --> 06:06:00.760 align:start position:0%
representative sherff just to follow up
 
06:06:02.830 --> 06:06:02.840 align:start position:0%
in our discussion on if this was going
 
06:06:05.190 --> 06:06:05.200 align:start position:0%
to resources if it was going to
 
06:06:06.948 --> 06:06:06.958 align:start position:0%
resources Mr chairman you'd have been
 
06:06:08.910 --> 06:06:08.920 align:start position:0%
told already it was the second committee
 
06:06:10.788 --> 06:06:10.798 align:start position:0%
Bill and to take it up early to get it
 
06:06:12.750 --> 06:06:12.760 align:start position:0%
out of committee so I believe this will
 
06:06:15.548 --> 06:06:15.558 align:start position:0%
be the one and only hearing on it
 
06:06:18.628 --> 06:06:18.638 align:start position:0%
correct and I have not heard anything so
 
06:06:24.150 --> 06:06:24.160 align:start position:0%
thank you for that uh other comments
 
06:06:27.030 --> 06:06:27.040 align:start position:0%
discussion okay we have a an amendment
 
06:06:28.910 --> 06:06:28.920 align:start position:0%
motion on the floor which is to amend
 
06:06:35.350 --> 06:06:35.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:39.830 --> 06:06:39.840 align:start position:0%
0192 uh so the motion is OTP on a to
 
06:06:42.708 --> 06:06:42.718 align:start position:0%

bill okay no it's not an early bill or
 
06:15:28.910 --> 06:15:28.920 align:start position:0%
it doesn't need a second committee so
 
06:15:32.150 --> 06:15:32.160 align:start position:0%
that should be good to go uh on consent
 
06:15:37.830 --> 06:15:37.840 align:start position:0%

there okay next up is uh another HB HB
 
06:15:57.948 --> 06:15:57.958 align:start position:0%
1338 this was the measure that had to do
 
06:15:59.750 --> 06:15:59.760 align:start position:0%
with uh The Selective
 
06:16:04.110 --> 06:16:04.120 align:start position:0%
Service and I'm looking for a motion um
 
06:16:06.868 --> 06:16:06.878 align:start position:0%
uh rson Manion do you you looking to
 
06:16:08.110 --> 06:16:08.120 align:start position:0%
make a motion on this yeah I'd like to
 
06:16:11.150 --> 06:16:11.160 align:start position:0%
make a motion to OTP motion of ought to
 
06:16:12.310 --> 06:16:12.320 align:start position:0%
pass on
 
06:16:15.910 --> 06:16:15.920 align:start position:0%
1338 uh is there a second representative
 
06:16:19.390 --> 06:16:19.400 align:start position:0%
finny seconds that um okay
 
06:16:21.510 --> 06:16:21.520 align:start position:0%
representative me would you care to
 
06:16:24.510 --> 06:16:24.520 align:start position:0%
speak to your OTP motion uh yes so this
 
06:16:26.990 --> 06:16:27.000 align:start position:0%
is a one of my bills it's going against
 
06:16:28.948 --> 06:16:28.958 align:start position:0%
the Selective Service Act it had three
 
06:16:30.310 --> 06:16:30.320 align:start position:0%
components one was a simple
 
06:16:32.030 --> 06:16:32.040 align:start position:0%
nullification saying that we wouldn't
 
06:16:33.628 --> 06:16:33.638 align:start position:0%
help the federal government enforce The
 
06:16:35.190 --> 06:16:35.200 align:start position:0%
Selective Service Act within our
 
06:16:37.910 --> 06:16:37.920 align:start position:0%
boundaries uh I am fearful that the
 
06:16:39.548 --> 06:16:39.558 align:start position:0%
federal government is moving us head
 
06:16:41.270 --> 06:16:41.280 align:start position:0%
headlong into like many multif front
 
06:16:43.150 --> 06:16:43.160 align:start position:0%
Wars potentially and I do not want to
 
06:16:45.070 --> 06:16:45.080 align:start position:0%
see our the Next Generation get dragged
 
06:16:46.430 --> 06:16:46.440 align:start position:0%
into conflicts that don't have anything
 
06:16:49.590 --> 06:16:49.600 align:start position:0%
to do with the United States directly um
 
06:16:51.910 --> 06:16:51.920 align:start position:0%
we've been lied into Iraq we spent 20
 
06:16:54.670 --> 06:16:54.680 align:start position:0%
years in Afghanistan most veterans don't
 
06:16:56.150 --> 06:16:56.160 align:start position:0%
from those conflicts don't think they
 
06:16:58.270 --> 06:16:58.280 align:start position:0%
were worth it ultimately I don't think a
 
06:17:02.510 --> 06:17:02.520 align:start position:0%
uh front a war against either uh China
 
06:17:05.948 --> 06:17:05.958 align:start position:0%
or uh Russia potentially Iran if some
 
06:17:08.430 --> 06:17:08.440 align:start position:0%
people win the presidential nomination
 
06:17:10.270 --> 06:17:10.280 align:start position:0%
uh these would be beneficial to the
 
06:17:11.830 --> 06:17:11.840 align:start position:0%
United States overall the second part of
 
06:17:13.708 --> 06:17:13.718 align:start position:0%
this bill was a removal of a uh
 
06:17:16.670 --> 06:17:16.680 align:start position:0%
restriction of if you want to apply to a
 
06:17:19.030 --> 06:17:19.040 align:start position:0%
um state college you'd have to be first
 
06:17:20.830 --> 06:17:20.840 align:start position:0%
registered with Selective Service I
 
06:17:21.510 --> 06:17:21.520 align:start position:0%
don't think that should be a
 
06:17:22.868 --> 06:17:22.878 align:start position:0%
prerequisite to go into education I
 
06:17:24.628 --> 06:17:24.638 align:start position:0%
don't understand why that's even in RSA
 
06:17:26.510 --> 06:17:26.520 align:start position:0%
it's been there since 99
 
06:17:28.390 --> 06:17:28.400 align:start position:0%
uh and then the third part was simply uh
 
06:17:29.990 --> 06:17:30.000 align:start position:0%
when you register for the draft as part
 
06:17:32.030 --> 06:17:32.040 align:start position:0%
of the uh when you get your license as I
 
06:17:34.350 --> 06:17:34.360 align:start position:0%
just added a check box that said uh I
 
06:17:37.110 --> 06:17:37.120 align:start position:0%
register as a um conscientious objector
 
06:17:38.190 --> 06:17:38.200 align:start position:0%
even though that's not the correct
 
06:17:39.590 --> 06:17:39.600 align:start position:0%
process I think it's important to send
 
06:17:44.350 --> 06:17:44.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:17:46.110 --> 06:17:46.120 align:start position:0%
that's thank you representative
 
06:17:47.590 --> 06:17:47.600 align:start position:0%
represent finny this you made the
 
06:17:50.548 --> 06:17:50.558 align:start position:0%
seconding motion um I would just add
 
06:17:52.948 --> 06:17:52.958 align:start position:0%
that uh we you know we don't want to
 
06:17:55.430 --> 06:17:55.440 align:start position:0%
encourage Force conscription um you know
 
06:17:57.110 --> 06:17:57.120 align:start position:0%
we do have an volunteer Force we should
 
06:17:59.390 --> 06:17:59.400 align:start position:0%
keep it that
 
06:18:03.070 --> 06:18:03.080 align:start position:0%
way thank you representative um I'm let
 
06:18:05.590 --> 06:18:05.600 align:start position:0%
me weigh in just a little bit on this uh
 
06:18:09.948 --> 06:18:09.958 align:start position:0%
I I I'm on a of a different mind on this
 
06:18:12.190 --> 06:18:12.200 align:start position:0%
I I think this is a vot your conscience
 
06:18:15.990 --> 06:18:16.000 align:start position:0%
measure uh as all measures should be um
 
06:18:16.000 --> 06:18:17.468 align:start position:0%
measure uh as all measures should be um
I

06:18:17.468 --> 06:18:17.478 align:start position:0%
I
 
06:18:20.510 --> 06:18:20.520 align:start position:0%
uh I understand the message you you
 
06:18:21.910 --> 06:18:21.920 align:start position:0%
mentioned sending a message I understand
 
06:18:23.868 --> 06:18:23.878 align:start position:0%
that message I I'm somewhat supportive
 
06:18:26.830 --> 06:18:26.840 align:start position:0%
of that message but um
 
06:18:28.510 --> 06:18:28.520 align:start position:0%
the reason we've kept selective service
 
06:18:32.030 --> 06:18:32.040 align:start position:0%
is just in case uh just in case there
 
06:18:35.910 --> 06:18:35.920 align:start position:0%
there's a need for people if we
 
06:18:38.830 --> 06:18:38.840 align:start position:0%
dismantle that system then uh I'm
 
06:18:41.030 --> 06:18:41.040 align:start position:0%
concerned that if that need ever came up
 
06:18:43.468 --> 06:18:43.478 align:start position:0%
that we uh would be stuck without a
 
06:18:46.350 --> 06:18:46.360 align:start position:0%
mechanism or process to get people that
 
06:18:48.628 --> 06:18:48.638 align:start position:0%
we might need I know there's a lot of
 
06:18:51.910 --> 06:18:51.920 align:start position:0%
pieces to this you know males females
 
06:18:56.628 --> 06:18:56.638 align:start position:0%
type uh so I I have uh I have questions
 
06:18:58.910 --> 06:18:58.920 align:start position:0%
in a in a problem with the OTP motion
 
06:19:01.150 --> 06:19:01.160 align:start position:0%
again that's me I know uh again this is
 
06:19:04.270 --> 06:19:04.280 align:start position:0%
a vote your conscience uh I the draft
 
06:19:06.910 --> 06:19:06.920 align:start position:0%
was eliminated in 1973 just as I turned
 
06:19:10.310 --> 06:19:10.320 align:start position:0%
18 uh and at the time I was pleased and
 
06:19:12.948 --> 06:19:12.958 align:start position:0%
who knew that uh nine years later I join
 
06:19:16.548 --> 06:19:16.558 align:start position:0%
the Marines on my own and and get 25
 
06:19:20.190 --> 06:19:20.200 align:start position:0%
years in as active in reserve uh also
 
06:19:23.510 --> 06:19:23.520 align:start position:0%
not that this affects this bill in 1973
 
06:19:25.110 --> 06:19:25.120 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire legislature and its
 
06:19:28.310 --> 06:19:28.320 align:start position:0%
wisdom Lo the drinking age to 18 on June
 
06:19:30.788 --> 06:19:30.798 align:start position:0%
1st the day after I turned 18
 
06:19:33.468 --> 06:19:33.478 align:start position:0%
so timing is everything they get rid of
 
06:19:34.948 --> 06:19:34.958 align:start position:0%
the draft and they lower the drinking
 
06:19:38.070 --> 06:19:38.080 align:start position:0%
age and uh and then uh anyway that's
 
06:19:40.430 --> 06:19:40.440 align:start position:0%
that's where I am on that I I it's going
 
06:19:42.150 --> 06:19:42.160 align:start position:0%
to be hard for me to support that other
 
06:19:46.510 --> 06:19:46.520 align:start position:0%
thoughts or representative uh who's okay
 
06:19:48.070 --> 06:19:48.080 align:start position:0%
represent M
 
06:19:51.548 --> 06:19:51.558 align:start position:0%
Miller um my concern is that you have
 
06:19:54.708 --> 06:19:54.718 align:start position:0%
the box of conscientious objector but
 
06:19:56.990 --> 06:19:57.000 align:start position:0%
people don't understand that in order to
 
06:20:00.868 --> 06:20:00.878 align:start position:0%
be exactly that there is a whole process
 
06:20:02.310 --> 06:20:02.320 align:start position:0%
that you have to go through you have to
 
06:20:05.030 --> 06:20:05.040 align:start position:0%
go to your local board you have to
 
06:20:07.948 --> 06:20:07.958 align:start position:0%
present information either documentary
 
06:20:11.628 --> 06:20:11.638 align:start position:0%
or with a a person attesting to your way
 
06:20:14.030 --> 06:20:14.040 align:start position:0%
of life that supports that conscientious
 
06:20:16.830 --> 06:20:16.840 align:start position:0%
obor and then if you want to appeal you
 
06:20:19.788 --> 06:20:19.798 align:start position:0%
have another set and I think it it makes
 
06:20:21.830 --> 06:20:21.840 align:start position:0%
it seem too simple that people don't
 
06:20:24.670 --> 06:20:24.680 align:start position:0%
realize there is a process and that
 
06:20:27.430 --> 06:20:27.440 align:start position:0%
process isn't in indicated on this so
 
06:20:29.270 --> 06:20:29.280 align:start position:0%
that's why I'll be voting against it but
 
06:20:29.280 --> 06:20:32.270 align:start position:0%
that's why I'll be voting against it but
thank

06:20:32.270 --> 06:20:32.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:35.350 --> 06:20:35.360 align:start position:0%
you other representative
 
06:20:39.910 --> 06:20:39.920 align:start position:0%
p uh thank you Mr chair and um I I have
 
06:20:42.628 --> 06:20:42.638 align:start position:0%
some concerns about this myself but it's
 
06:20:46.390 --> 06:20:46.400 align:start position:0%
almost like we're putting the horse in
 
06:20:48.708 --> 06:20:48.718 align:start position:0%
the cart in front of the horse here if
 
06:20:50.670 --> 06:20:50.680 align:start position:0%
we have a conflict you you want to be
 
06:20:52.830 --> 06:20:52.840 align:start position:0%
able to rely on the system we have in
 
06:20:55.190 --> 06:20:55.200 align:start position:0%
place now not something that the
 
06:20:57.390 --> 06:20:57.400 align:start position:0%
conflict happens and we have to rely on
 
06:21:02.270 --> 06:21:02.280 align:start position:0%
something new or not in existence so I I
 
06:21:04.350 --> 06:21:04.360 align:start position:0%
just uh I have some real concerns with
 
06:21:07.990 --> 06:21:08.000 align:start position:0%
that I think that that's that I I I will
 
06:21:08.000 --> 06:21:10.350 align:start position:0%
that I think that that's that I I I will
not

06:21:10.350 --> 06:21:10.360 align:start position:0%
not
 
06:21:12.510 --> 06:21:12.520 align:start position:0%
support than thank you
 
06:21:16.230 --> 06:21:16.240 align:start position:0%
representative other
 
06:21:19.990 --> 06:21:20.000 align:start position:0%
comments oh uh representative tol so um
 
06:21:21.830 --> 06:21:21.840 align:start position:0%
I I just want to say that like I I'm
 
06:21:21.840 --> 06:21:22.868 align:start position:0%
I I just want to say that like I I'm
leaning

06:21:22.868 --> 06:21:22.878 align:start position:0%
leaning
 
06:21:28.030 --> 06:21:28.040 align:start position:0%
towards supporting this because um I I'm
 
06:21:30.468 --> 06:21:30.478 align:start position:0%
an anti I consider myself in general
 
06:21:32.310 --> 06:21:32.320 align:start position:0%
whenever conflict can be avoided it
 
06:21:34.948 --> 06:21:34.958 align:start position:0%
should be and um conscientious obors
 
06:21:37.110 --> 06:21:37.120 align:start position:0%
should be supported but because Linda
 
06:21:39.670 --> 06:21:39.680 align:start position:0%
brings up um rep mamillo some really
 
06:21:42.628 --> 06:21:42.638 align:start position:0%
important concerns I I I would really
 
06:21:45.110 --> 06:21:45.120 align:start position:0%
like to see this amended on the floor um
 
06:21:49.150 --> 06:21:49.160 align:start position:0%
and so I I I'm are you willing to do
 
06:21:52.150 --> 06:21:52.160 align:start position:0%
that great then I'm willing to vote for
 
06:21:54.788 --> 06:21:54.798 align:start position:0%
it representative Jack uh thank you Mr
 
06:21:56.430 --> 06:21:56.440 align:start position:0%
chairman if I understood the speaker
 
06:21:58.230 --> 06:21:58.240 align:start position:0%
correctly there is a change to driver
 
06:22:00.230 --> 06:22:00.240 align:start position:0%
licensing and if that's the case it
 
06:22:01.830 --> 06:22:01.840 align:start position:0%
should come with funding to make the
 
06:22:03.670 --> 06:22:03.680 align:start position:0%
change to the computer system that they
 
06:22:07.750 --> 06:22:07.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:22:07.760 --> 06:22:09.510 align:start position:0%
 
checkbox

06:22:09.510 --> 06:22:09.520 align:start position:0%
checkbox
 
06:22:09.520 --> 06:22:11.350 align:start position:0%
checkbox
okay

06:22:11.350 --> 06:22:11.360 align:start position:0%

agenda um just just to clarify the uh
 
06:25:44.030 --> 06:25:44.040 align:start position:0%
the first motion failed um OTP filled 13
 
06:25:50.350 --> 06:25:50.360 align:start position:0%
to7 and then the motion for itl was
 
06:25:54.390 --> 06:25:54.400 align:start position:0%
14-6 I just make someone changed was it
 
06:25:56.350 --> 06:25:56.360 align:start position:0%
the rep
 
06:25:58.270 --> 06:25:58.280 align:start position:0%
which is okay I just want to make sure
 
06:26:00.750 --> 06:26:00.760 align:start position:0%
our numbers make and I second the motion
 
06:26:03.390 --> 06:26:03.400 align:start position:0%
itl I was going to give representative
 
06:26:04.990 --> 06:26:05.000 align:start position:0%
the benefit of the doubt but he was
 
06:26:07.910 --> 06:26:07.920 align:start position:0%
short by four votes so I changed mine
 
06:26:11.750 --> 06:26:11.760 align:start position:0%
okay so 14 to six it is uh represent
 
06:26:14.468 --> 06:26:14.478 align:start position:0%
Mass having made the prevailing motion
 
06:26:17.190 --> 06:26:17.200 align:start position:0%
if if you could uh make sure you or
 
06:26:20.830 --> 06:26:20.840 align:start position:0%
someone gets a report to me okay uh rep
 
06:26:22.230 --> 06:26:22.240 align:start position:0%
Manion I'm going to think you may want
 
06:26:24.150 --> 06:26:24.160 align:start position:0%
to do a Minority Report yeah I'll do a
 
06:26:26.350 --> 06:26:26.360 align:start position:0%
Minority Report
 
06:26:28.150 --> 06:26:28.160 align:start position:0%
okay so that one uh will not be on
 
06:26:30.310 --> 06:26:30.320 align:start position:0%
consent we'll have two reports coming to
 
06:26:38.390 --> 06:26:38.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:26:43.788 --> 06:26:43.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:26:48.868 --> 06:26:48.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:26:52.750 --> 06:26:52.760 align:start position:0%
uh U somebody have a question we good
 
06:26:54.230 --> 06:26:54.240 align:start position:0%
representative over there had his hands
 
06:26:56.510 --> 06:26:56.520 align:start position:0%
up I thought he was giving up
 
06:26:59.548 --> 06:26:59.558 align:start position:0%
uh no I'm just gesturing across the
 
06:27:01.948 --> 06:27:01.958 align:start position:0%
aisle okay
 
06:27:06.788 --> 06:27:06.798 align:start position:0%
uh next up is uh hr21 house resolution
 
06:27:10.548 --> 06:27:10.558 align:start position:0%
21 that has to do with the uh the
 
06:27:14.190 --> 06:27:14.200 align:start position:0%
militia um the militia measure uh it's a
 
06:27:19.468 --> 06:27:19.478 align:start position:0%
HR uh to support the militia uh R Manion
 
06:27:21.670 --> 06:27:21.680 align:start position:0%
um do you have a motion on that one yeah
 
06:27:24.868 --> 06:27:24.878 align:start position:0%
I motion OTP on this as well is there
 
06:27:26.510 --> 06:27:26.520 align:start position:0%
and and again representative finny
 
06:27:28.110 --> 06:27:28.120 align:start position:0%
second so representative Manion with a
 
06:27:29.430 --> 06:27:29.440 align:start position:0%
motion representative finny with a
 
06:27:30.750 --> 06:27:30.760 align:start position:0%
second representative Manion would you
 
06:27:33.350 --> 06:27:33.360 align:start position:0%
here to speak to your motion uh yeah so
 
06:27:33.360 --> 06:27:34.190 align:start position:0%
here to speak to your motion uh yeah so
the

06:27:34.190 --> 06:27:34.200 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:27:37.468 --> 06:27:37.478 align:start position:0%
um the the militia is uh a separate
 
06:27:38.430 --> 06:27:38.440 align:start position:0%
component so this would be the
 
06:27:40.910 --> 06:27:40.920 align:start position:0%
unorganized militia that's inside of our
 
06:27:43.390 --> 06:27:43.400 align:start position:0%
uh Constitution and the RSA also
 
06:27:46.430 --> 06:27:46.440 align:start position:0%
provides for this uh unorganized mil
 
06:27:48.510 --> 06:27:48.520 align:start position:0%
militia would be like any a able-body
 
06:27:50.670 --> 06:27:50.680 align:start position:0%
individual over the age of 18 you're
 
06:27:52.190 --> 06:27:52.200 align:start position:0%
responsible to train yourself you're
 
06:27:54.030 --> 06:27:54.040 align:start position:0%
responsible in being well versed in
 
06:27:55.708 --> 06:27:55.718 align:start position:0%
firearms and and things like that the
 
06:27:57.708 --> 06:27:57.718 align:start position:0%
idea of this would be to repel
 
06:27:59.990 --> 06:28:00.000 align:start position:0%
specifically The Invasion so like if the
 
06:28:01.548 --> 06:28:01.558 align:start position:0%
National Guard is you know Tapped Out
 
06:28:03.310 --> 06:28:03.320 align:start position:0%
sent overseas and God knows wherever and
 
06:28:05.510 --> 06:28:05.520 align:start position:0%
we get invaded uh the militia would be
 
06:28:07.468 --> 06:28:07.478 align:start position:0%
the last line of defense each and every
 
06:28:09.310 --> 06:28:09.320 align:start position:0%
one of us is capable of being a part of
 
06:28:10.590 --> 06:28:10.600 align:start position:0%
this militia and the reaffirming of the
 
06:28:12.910 --> 06:28:12.920 align:start position:0%
militia this you know HR is just
 
06:28:14.750 --> 06:28:14.760 align:start position:0%
basically saying we recognize that the
 
06:28:16.270 --> 06:28:16.280 align:start position:0%
militia is a component of our our
 
06:28:17.590 --> 06:28:17.600 align:start position:0%
current state law and it is something
 
06:28:22.990 --> 06:28:23.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:28:27.230 --> 06:28:27.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:28:29.190 --> 06:28:29.200 align:start position:0%
uh just uh real quick I just want to add
 
06:28:30.390 --> 06:28:30.400 align:start position:0%
that the militia is only made up of
 
06:28:33.070 --> 06:28:33.080 align:start position:0%
citizens not made up of uniformed um you
 
06:28:35.230 --> 06:28:35.240 align:start position:0%
know you know um like
 
06:28:37.830 --> 06:28:37.840 align:start position:0%
armed body it's not you know like you
 
06:28:38.990 --> 06:28:39.000 align:start position:0%
mentioned it's not part of the National
 
06:28:41.948 --> 06:28:41.958 align:start position:0%
Guard it's not part of the the reserves
 
06:28:45.070 --> 06:28:45.080 align:start position:0%
um is kind of related to the military um
 
06:28:47.150 --> 06:28:47.160 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry the The Selective Service
 
06:28:48.468 --> 06:28:48.478 align:start position:0%
component where if we're worried about
 
06:28:50.468 --> 06:28:50.478 align:start position:0%
not having enough people who want to
 
06:28:51.910 --> 06:28:51.920 align:start position:0%
join the military they still have the
 
06:28:53.670 --> 06:28:53.680 align:start position:0%
option to be in a militia and to trade
 
06:28:55.750 --> 06:28:55.760 align:start position:0%
and be proficient in firearms and and
 
06:28:57.030 --> 06:28:57.040 align:start position:0%
you know that kind of training I think
 
06:29:00.670 --> 06:29:00.680 align:start position:0%
it's important for all of us uh to be um
 
06:29:02.708 --> 06:29:02.718 align:start position:0%
be willing to to do that for themselves
 
06:29:04.230 --> 06:29:04.240 align:start position:0%
in their family we have a lot to to
 
06:29:05.948 --> 06:29:05.958 align:start position:0%
uphold and protect here and I don't see
 
06:29:07.670 --> 06:29:07.680 align:start position:0%
anything wrong with affirming
 
06:29:10.270 --> 06:29:10.280 align:start position:0%
it thank you representative I have a
 
06:29:13.670 --> 06:29:13.680 align:start position:0%
comment uh and it just has to do with uh
 
06:29:15.830 --> 06:29:15.840 align:start position:0%
some confusion that is out there we all
 
06:29:17.910 --> 06:29:17.920 align:start position:0%
I think we defend the guard bill this
 
06:29:21.670 --> 06:29:21.680 align:start position:0%
came up uh time and again a lot of folks
 
06:29:24.150 --> 06:29:24.160 align:start position:0%
don't understand that there different
 
06:29:26.708 --> 06:29:26.718 align:start position:0%
levels of mil I I I think some of us do
 
06:29:29.430 --> 06:29:29.440 align:start position:0%
in this committee um and that's what
 
06:29:32.270 --> 06:29:32.280 align:start position:0%
this is about this is not about as I
 
06:29:35.468 --> 06:29:35.478 align:start position:0%
understand it this is not about the
 
06:29:39.270 --> 06:29:39.280 align:start position:0%
National Guard it's about uh raising
 
06:29:41.990 --> 06:29:42.000 align:start position:0%
awareness and supporting the notion of
 
06:29:43.070 --> 06:29:43.080 align:start position:0%
the the
 
06:29:47.310 --> 06:29:47.320 align:start position:0%
militia um and I I have some mixed
 
06:29:50.310 --> 06:29:50.320 align:start position:0%
feelings about that part partly because
 
06:29:53.310 --> 06:29:53.320 align:start position:0%
uh I know there's there there will be
 
06:29:55.750 --> 06:29:55.760 align:start position:0%
there is confusion we this contribute to
 
06:29:57.868 --> 06:29:57.878 align:start position:0%
the confusion possibly is it our job to
 
06:29:59.430 --> 06:29:59.440 align:start position:0%
educate people or maybe that's what will
 
06:30:01.070 --> 06:30:01.080 align:start position:0%
come out of this is that that some
 
06:30:03.310 --> 06:30:03.320 align:start position:0%
people will learn that there's different
 
06:30:06.390 --> 06:30:06.400 align:start position:0%
levels of militia um again this is a v
 
06:30:09.788 --> 06:30:09.798 align:start position:0%
your conscience thing as as an earlier
 
06:30:12.990 --> 06:30:13.000 align:start position:0%
measure was uh I have some concerns
 
06:30:15.670 --> 06:30:15.680 align:start position:0%
about it I understand the intent um it's
 
06:30:17.070 --> 06:30:17.080 align:start position:0%
not an easy call for me I have some
 
06:30:19.670 --> 06:30:19.680 align:start position:0%
concerns about it I I know that the our
 
06:30:21.510 --> 06:30:21.520 align:start position:0%
friends in in
 
06:30:21.520 --> 06:30:23.070 align:start position:0%
friends in in
um

06:30:23.070 --> 06:30:23.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:30:27.788 --> 06:30:27.798 align:start position:0%
esac uh to include I I think the uh the
 
06:30:30.868 --> 06:30:30.878 align:start position:0%
the adant in general had had some um con
 
06:30:32.868 --> 06:30:32.878 align:start position:0%
questions and concern about out it too
 
06:30:35.510 --> 06:30:35.520 align:start position:0%
so anyway I I uh I have problems with it
 
06:30:38.070 --> 06:30:38.080 align:start position:0%
and that's that's where I'm at other
 
06:30:40.708 --> 06:30:40.718 align:start position:0%
thoughts uh representative
 
06:30:43.430 --> 06:30:43.440 align:start position:0%
levit uh we discussed this pretty well
 
06:30:46.270 --> 06:30:46.280 align:start position:0%
in the public hearing and um I don't see
 
06:30:50.948 --> 06:30:50.958 align:start position:0%
a needed law to have militia I mean I
 
06:30:52.670 --> 06:30:52.680 align:start position:0%
understand it just probably
 
06:30:55.430 --> 06:30:55.440 align:start position:0%
authenticates it but I mean on the fence
 
06:30:59.310 --> 06:30:59.320 align:start position:0%
too I mean the you know the testimony
 
06:31:03.948 --> 06:31:03.958 align:start position:0%
didn't sway me towards it but um I I
 
06:31:06.070 --> 06:31:06.080 align:start position:0%
probably would be okay with it but I'm
 
06:31:09.030 --> 06:31:09.040 align:start position:0%
not siding on the um positive side on
 
06:31:09.040 --> 06:31:10.230 align:start position:0%
not siding on the um positive side on
this

06:31:10.230 --> 06:31:10.240 align:start position:0%
this
 
06:31:12.590 --> 06:31:12.600 align:start position:0%
one thank you representative other
 
06:31:14.150 --> 06:31:14.160 align:start position:0%
thoughts represent
 
06:31:17.670 --> 06:31:17.680 align:start position:0%
Miller I'm one of those confused people
 
06:31:19.788 --> 06:31:19.798 align:start position:0%
because I looked up information and it
 
06:31:21.788 --> 06:31:21.798 align:start position:0%
said that in
 
06:31:24.910 --> 06:31:24.920 align:start position:0%
1879 the New Hampshire militia was
 
06:31:27.110 --> 06:31:27.120 align:start position:0%
designated as the New Hampshire National
 
06:31:29.230 --> 06:31:29.240 align:start position:0%
Guard and that in
 
06:31:32.430 --> 06:31:32.440 align:start position:0%
1916 the National Defense Act changed
 
06:31:34.590 --> 06:31:34.600 align:start position:0%
that to the na New Hampshire National
 
06:31:37.510 --> 06:31:37.520 align:start position:0%
Guard so can you give me some clarity
 
06:31:39.990 --> 06:31:40.000 align:start position:0%
here yeah so the uh what had been the
 
06:31:41.868 --> 06:31:41.878 align:start position:0%
militia for like the standing army the
 
06:31:43.708 --> 06:31:43.718 align:start position:0%
state whatever it may be had eventually
 
06:31:45.110 --> 06:31:45.120 align:start position:0%
been incorporated into the National
 
06:31:46.910 --> 06:31:46.920 align:start position:0%
Guard but our RSA provides for a
 
06:31:49.030 --> 06:31:49.040 align:start position:0%
separate organization and the agitant
 
06:31:51.670 --> 06:31:51.680 align:start position:0%
general did specify that we do have
 
06:31:53.230 --> 06:31:53.240 align:start position:0%
every single one of us an able-body
 
06:31:55.548 --> 06:31:55.558 align:start position:0%
individual it could be in the militia
 
06:31:57.830 --> 06:31:57.840 align:start position:0%
it's the unorganized militia the militia
 
06:32:00.150 --> 06:32:00.160 align:start position:0%
before the as you were saying the 1800s
 
06:32:02.110 --> 06:32:02.120 align:start position:0%
was cons has been rolled up into the
 
06:32:04.510 --> 06:32:04.520 align:start position:0%
National Guard each and every one of us
 
06:32:06.030 --> 06:32:06.040 align:start position:0%
is the militia like in the Second
 
06:32:07.310 --> 06:32:07.320 align:start position:0%
Amendment or the United States it
 
06:32:09.310 --> 06:32:09.320 align:start position:0%
mentions the well-regulated militia
 
06:32:11.190 --> 06:32:11.200 align:start position:0%
that's all of us that's exactly what
 
06:32:13.388 --> 06:32:13.398 align:start position:0%
this is describing you don't want me in
 
06:32:15.350 --> 06:32:15.360 align:start position:0%
your a militia that's okay it's it's
 
06:32:17.868 --> 06:32:17.878 align:start position:0%
voluntary it's not a cons I I oppose
 
06:32:22.628 --> 06:32:22.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:32:26.910 --> 06:32:26.920 align:start position:0%

that there's a lot of confusion around
 
06:34:44.030 --> 06:34:44.040 align:start position:0%
this and I think it needs to be uh
 
06:34:46.070 --> 06:34:46.080 align:start position:0%
clarified I certainly understand that a
 
06:34:47.750 --> 06:34:47.760 align:start position:0%
militia is recognized in the
 
06:34:49.948 --> 06:34:49.958 align:start position:0%
Constitution but um just making sure
 
06:34:53.388 --> 06:34:53.398 align:start position:0%

Rollins and uh okay repres Manion
 
06:37:31.548 --> 06:37:31.558 align:start position:0%
uh yep so when these uh men came in uh I
 
06:37:33.750 --> 06:37:33.760 align:start position:0%
when I first saw this bill filed I I was
 
06:37:35.310 --> 06:37:35.320 align:start position:0%
vaguely aware of the USS Liberty
 
06:37:37.310 --> 06:37:37.320 align:start position:0%
incident but I think what I understood
 
06:37:39.350 --> 06:37:39.360 align:start position:0%
was only the official story which is
 
06:37:41.030 --> 06:37:41.040 align:start position:0%
that that it was an accident and you
 
06:37:43.110 --> 06:37:43.120 align:start position:0%
know no malfant and the government did
 
06:37:44.830 --> 06:37:44.840 align:start position:0%
everything they could to investigate it
 
06:37:46.430 --> 06:37:46.440 align:start position:0%
and then having all of those veterans
 
06:37:48.230 --> 06:37:48.240 align:start position:0%
come in here and speak and tell their
 
06:37:50.350 --> 06:37:50.360 align:start position:0%
story from their perspective I
 
06:37:52.948 --> 06:37:52.958 align:start position:0%
understand how disconnected DC can be
 
06:37:54.750 --> 06:37:54.760 align:start position:0%
from like combat operations like things
 
06:37:56.830 --> 06:37:56.840 align:start position:0%
happen on the ground and the guys that
 
06:37:58.708 --> 06:37:58.718 align:start position:0%
have been there they know better than
 
06:38:00.708 --> 06:38:00.718 align:start position:0%
those guys sitting in the Pentagon they
 
06:38:02.350 --> 06:38:02.360 align:start position:0%
don't the guys over there that are doing
 
06:38:04.190 --> 06:38:04.200 align:start position:0%
their reports like they're just
 
06:38:05.948 --> 06:38:05.958 align:start position:0%
disconnected from reality and I feel
 
06:38:07.708 --> 06:38:07.718 align:start position:0%
like this goes back decades right this
 
06:38:10.150 --> 06:38:10.160 align:start position:0%
is in the 60s and I feel like nothing's
 
06:38:12.910 --> 06:38:12.920 align:start position:0%
changed in 50 years and they got like
 
06:38:15.230 --> 06:38:15.240 align:start position:0%
brushed over by congress with like they
 
06:38:16.708 --> 06:38:16.718 align:start position:0%
said what was it a five-day
 
06:38:18.230 --> 06:38:18.240 align:start position:0%
investigation where some of these other
 
06:38:20.150 --> 06:38:20.160 align:start position:0%
investigations have gone on for years
 
06:38:22.190 --> 06:38:22.200 align:start position:0%
for next to nothing like how long did
 
06:38:25.150 --> 06:38:25.160 align:start position:0%
the Clinton dress thing go on for right
 
06:38:28.110 --> 06:38:28.120 align:start position:0%
and like these men like were attacked by
 
06:38:33.388 --> 06:38:33.398 align:start position:0%
 
06:38:36.150 --> 06:38:36.160 align:start position:0%
hours right it took hour like the the
 
06:38:37.948 --> 06:38:37.958 align:start position:0%
combat like the the assault took hours
 
06:38:39.590 --> 06:38:39.600 align:start position:0%
and hours it was a lot more than just a
 
06:38:41.270 --> 06:38:41.280 align:start position:0%
mistaken identity if it was a mistaken
 
06:38:42.350 --> 06:38:42.360 align:start position:0%
identity it would have been a single
 
06:38:44.788 --> 06:38:44.798 align:start position:0%
shot and they would have flagged from my
 
06:38:46.910 --> 06:38:46.920 align:start position:0%
understanding these men had the U the US
 
06:38:49.310 --> 06:38:49.320 align:start position:0%
flag flying high and it was completely
 
06:38:52.830 --> 06:38:52.840 align:start position:0%
ignored I don't want to you know assign
 
06:38:54.468 --> 06:38:54.478 align:start position:0%
motivations or anything behind at all
 
06:38:55.948 --> 06:38:55.958 align:start position:0%
and that's what I think this committee
 
06:38:58.070 --> 06:38:58.080 align:start position:0%
should try to find we may not have
 
06:39:00.150 --> 06:39:00.160 align:start position:0%
subpoena power against like classified
 
06:39:01.510 --> 06:39:01.520 align:start position:0%
documents things that the government has
 
06:39:02.990 --> 06:39:03.000 align:start position:0%
locked away but I think it would be
 
06:39:06.150 --> 06:39:06.160 align:start position:0%
valuable to put these men in front of a
 
06:39:08.310 --> 06:39:08.320 align:start position:0%
committee get all of their record their
 
06:39:10.548 --> 06:39:10.558 align:start position:0%
testimony on record because all that
 
06:39:12.590 --> 06:39:12.600 align:start position:0%
they have is they've been maligned by
 
06:39:15.030 --> 06:39:15.040 align:start position:0%
the media they they're stuck like all
 
06:39:16.990 --> 06:39:17.000 align:start position:0%
they do is like they're on podcast just
 
06:39:18.190 --> 06:39:18.200 align:start position:0%
trying to get their truth out there and
 
06:39:19.910 --> 06:39:19.920 align:start position:0%
all they want is like their day in court
 
06:39:21.830 --> 06:39:21.840 align:start position:0%
so to speak and they never got it these
 
06:39:25.310 --> 06:39:25.320 align:start position:0%
men never got it
 
06:39:26.510 --> 06:39:26.520 align:start position:0%
thank you representative representive
 
06:39:28.788 --> 06:39:28.798 align:start position:0%
Rollins you you seconded
 
06:39:31.270 --> 06:39:31.280 align:start position:0%
it yes I'd like to also speak I'd like
 
06:39:33.910 --> 06:39:33.920 align:start position:0%
to take a a moment uh everybody here on
 
06:39:35.830 --> 06:39:35.840 align:start position:0%
this committee had I think well maybe
 
06:39:37.628 --> 06:39:37.638 align:start position:0%
not some of the subs but knows I'm a
 
06:39:40.868 --> 06:39:40.878 align:start position:0%
gold sta father I lost my son in Iraq
 
06:39:42.990 --> 06:39:43.000 align:start position:0%
the night before his last night home on
 
06:39:46.030 --> 06:39:46.040 align:start position:0%
leave um we went outside we were having
 
06:39:47.670 --> 06:39:47.680 align:start position:0%
a couple beer together he asked me to
 
06:39:49.388 --> 06:39:49.398 align:start position:0%
make him three promises if he didn't
 
06:39:51.190 --> 06:39:51.200 align:start position:0%
make it home I made him the three
 
06:39:53.670 --> 06:39:53.680 align:start position:0%
promises and I held to all three okay
 
06:39:56.150 --> 06:39:56.160 align:start position:0%
then he made me a promise the promise
 
06:39:59.750 --> 06:39:59.760 align:start position:0%
that made that he made me was not unique
 
06:40:02.590 --> 06:40:02.600 align:start position:0%
to my son but it is unique to everyone
 
06:40:05.190 --> 06:40:05.200 align:start position:0%
that has worn a uniform in this country
 
06:40:08.110 --> 06:40:08.120 align:start position:0%
ever since the Revolutionary War and it
 
06:40:11.510 --> 06:40:11.520 align:start position:0%
is unique to those men on the Liberty
 
06:40:13.150 --> 06:40:13.160 align:start position:0%
that were shot up that day where we lost
 
06:40:16.350 --> 06:40:16.360 align:start position:0%
over was 178 men I think it was and
 
06:40:16.360 --> 06:40:19.388 align:start position:0%
over was 178 men I think it was and
others

06:40:19.388 --> 06:40:19.398 align:start position:0%
 
06:40:22.310 --> 06:40:22.320 align:start position:0%
wounded that's a that's a promise that
 
06:40:23.948 --> 06:40:23.958 align:start position:0%
we need to make back to these people
 
06:40:26.788 --> 06:40:26.798 align:start position:0%
people that understanding the sacrifice
 
06:40:30.830 --> 06:40:30.840 align:start position:0%
that they make um they sign on the
 
06:40:32.230 --> 06:40:32.240 align:start position:0%
dotted line when you sign up for the
 
06:40:34.310 --> 06:40:34.320 align:start position:0%
service you sign on a dotted line up to
 
06:40:37.310 --> 06:40:37.320 align:start position:0%
and including including my own life okay
 
06:40:39.110 --> 06:40:39.120 align:start position:0%
that's understandable my son paid that
 
06:40:42.350 --> 06:40:42.360 align:start position:0%
price many many like several million
 
06:40:44.830 --> 06:40:44.840 align:start position:0%
people in history the United States has
 
06:40:47.948 --> 06:40:47.958 align:start position:0%
made that sacrifice and paid that price
 
06:40:51.708 --> 06:40:51.718 align:start position:0%
but for these men on this on that ship
 
06:40:53.990 --> 06:40:54.000 align:start position:0%
they did not sign up to be sacri
 
06:40:56.388 --> 06:40:56.398 align:start position:0%
official Lambs to a higher government
 
06:40:59.788 --> 06:40:59.798 align:start position:0%
order and be left there to die and hope
 
06:41:01.628 --> 06:41:01.638 align:start position:0%
that they were all the boat would sink
 
06:41:02.990 --> 06:41:03.000 align:start position:0%
and they would all go to the bottom of
 
06:41:03.000 --> 06:41:03.750 align:start position:0%
and they would all go to the bottom of
the

06:41:03.750 --> 06:41:03.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:41:07.150 --> 06:41:07.160 align:start position:0%
ocean that is wrong that is just dead
 
06:41:10.388 --> 06:41:10.398 align:start position:0%
wrong I will stand by every veteran for
 
06:41:13.230 --> 06:41:13.240 align:start position:0%
what my son serve for to my dying day
 
06:41:14.910 --> 06:41:14.920 align:start position:0%
and I'll take a bullet for any any
 
06:41:17.430 --> 06:41:17.440 align:start position:0%
veteran out there I cely hope that
 
06:41:20.110 --> 06:41:20.120 align:start position:0%
everyone put some serious consideration
 
06:41:22.388 --> 06:41:22.398 align:start position:0%
into voting ought to pass on this on
 
06:41:25.388 --> 06:41:25.398 align:start position:0%
this belt I know some people say well
 
06:41:27.150 --> 06:41:27.160 align:start position:0%
the timing is not good it's not about
 
06:41:29.548 --> 06:41:29.558 align:start position:0%
timing this is a simple house resolution
 
06:41:33.948 --> 06:41:33.958 align:start position:0%
bill just asking Washington to give them
 
06:41:37.030 --> 06:41:37.040 align:start position:0%
where the these men have been ignored
 
06:41:39.948 --> 06:41:39.958 align:start position:0%
for 56 years no state would ever take a
 
06:41:42.310 --> 06:41:42.320 align:start position:0%
resolution up like that New Hampshire is
 
06:41:45.670 --> 06:41:45.680 align:start position:0%
the first state that has actually said
 
06:41:48.230 --> 06:41:48.240 align:start position:0%
we will do we will take this resolution
 
06:41:50.388 --> 06:41:50.398 align:start position:0%
up and we will vote on it those men were
 
06:41:53.310 --> 06:41:53.320 align:start position:0%
EST static they're finally being heard
 
06:41:54.590 --> 06:41:54.600 align:start position:0%
these men
 
06:41:57.830 --> 06:41:57.840 align:start position:0%
deserve closure just like I had closure
 
06:42:00.270 --> 06:42:00.280 align:start position:0%
when my son's remains came home I hope
 
06:42:01.910 --> 06:42:01.920 align:start position:0%
that you can find it in your heart
 
06:42:04.150 --> 06:42:04.160 align:start position:0%
Overlook other things and to support
 
06:42:05.910 --> 06:42:05.920 align:start position:0%
these men for what they have been
 
06:42:07.670 --> 06:42:07.680 align:start position:0%
through for the last what they went
 
06:42:09.430 --> 06:42:09.440 align:start position:0%
through that day and what they've been
 
06:42:12.110 --> 06:42:12.120 align:start position:0%
through for the last 56 years where
 
06:42:14.830 --> 06:42:14.840 align:start position:0%
nobody nobody would listen to them and I
 
06:42:18.150 --> 06:42:18.160 align:start position:0%
am appalled that that's my saying Mr
 
06:42:21.628 --> 06:42:21.638 align:start position:0%
chairman M Mr chairman uh representative
 
06:42:25.468 --> 06:42:25.478 align:start position:0%
gagy thank you I share the
 
06:42:27.910 --> 06:42:27.920 align:start position:0%
sentiments I share got to keep my
 
06:42:30.830 --> 06:42:30.840 align:start position:0%
fingers to myself I share the sentiments
 
06:42:33.670 --> 06:42:33.680 align:start position:0%
of these two gentlemen here now I served
 
06:42:36.628 --> 06:42:36.638 align:start position:0%
in the 60s I served I got out just
 
06:42:37.990 --> 06:42:38.000 align:start position:0%
before this
 
06:42:41.030 --> 06:42:41.040 align:start position:0%
incident um I was on shipboard I never
 
06:42:43.548 --> 06:42:43.558 align:start position:0%
was in combat never did any shooting no
 
06:42:45.830 --> 06:42:45.840 align:start position:0%
no combat except a
 
06:42:47.990 --> 06:42:48.000 align:start position:0%
Shore and
 
06:42:51.510 --> 06:42:51.520 align:start position:0%
uh and I know in my
 
06:42:54.388 --> 06:42:54.398 align:start position:0%
heart that unfortunately
 
06:42:56.468 --> 06:42:56.478 align:start position:0%
this probably won't get any legs when it
 
06:43:00.270 --> 06:43:00.280 align:start position:0%
gets to the higher hierarchy however
 
06:43:03.270 --> 06:43:03.280 align:start position:0%
what I want for those Shipmates is
 
06:43:05.190 --> 06:43:05.200 align:start position:0%
closure and that's what they're looking
 
06:43:10.110 --> 06:43:10.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:43:12.350 --> 06:43:12.360 align:start position:0%
it uh representative
 
06:43:16.110 --> 06:43:16.120 align:start position:0%
n thank you and representative Rollins I
 
06:43:18.990 --> 06:43:19.000 align:start position:0%
I um respect you more than I can ever
 
06:43:20.830 --> 06:43:20.840 align:start position:0%
say and I have your son's picture
 
06:43:22.190 --> 06:43:22.200 align:start position:0%
hanging in my
 
06:43:24.350 --> 06:43:24.360 align:start position:0%
office I was not not here for the
 
06:43:27.628 --> 06:43:27.638 align:start position:0%
hearing I didn't hear what was said what
 
06:43:30.190 --> 06:43:30.200 align:start position:0%
I I I do understand it's to my
 
06:43:32.270 --> 06:43:32.280 align:start position:0%
understanding that this um the USS
 
06:43:34.230 --> 06:43:34.240 align:start position:0%
Liberty was fully investigated three
 
06:43:36.468 --> 06:43:36.478 align:start position:0%
times and Israel already apologized
 
06:43:39.270 --> 06:43:39.280 align:start position:0%
decades ago and with anti-Semitism On
 
06:43:42.030 --> 06:43:42.040 align:start position:0%
The Rise I fear that voting for this
 
06:43:44.830 --> 06:43:44.840 align:start position:0%
measure will get me labeled in the media
 
06:43:48.310 --> 06:43:48.320 align:start position:0%
by as an anti-semite and I don't I I
 
06:43:50.430 --> 06:43:50.440 align:start position:0%
don't want to do that so my vote does
 
06:43:56.910 --> 06:43:56.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:44:00.030 --> 06:44:00.040 align:start position:0%
here representative finny yeah we're not
 
06:44:02.388 --> 06:44:02.398 align:start position:0%
talking about you know stuff that that's
 
06:44:03.468 --> 06:44:03.478 align:start position:0%
happening now we're talking about
 
06:44:06.070 --> 06:44:06.080 align:start position:0%
something that happened in the 60s and
 
06:44:07.350 --> 06:44:07.360 align:start position:0%
if there was Bad actors in the
 
06:44:09.430 --> 06:44:09.440 align:start position:0%
government on the American side they
 
06:44:11.430 --> 06:44:11.440 align:start position:0%
should be called out for who they are if
 
06:44:13.990 --> 06:44:14.000 align:start position:0%
they sent those men to die as a as a
 
06:44:16.190 --> 06:44:16.200 align:start position:0%
political Pawn then they should be held
 
06:44:17.510 --> 06:44:17.520 align:start position:0%
accountable and that's what that you
 
06:44:18.788 --> 06:44:18.798 align:start position:0%
know that's what this bill is trying to
 
06:44:20.150 --> 06:44:20.160 align:start position:0%
do but it's only established as a
 
06:44:21.510 --> 06:44:21.520 align:start position:0%
commission we're not actually like going
 
06:44:23.310 --> 06:44:23.320 align:start position:0%
to the investigative process into this
 
06:44:25.150 --> 06:44:25.160 align:start position:0%
in it we're just establishing a
 
06:44:27.670 --> 06:44:27.680 align:start position:0%
commission to gain information so that's
 
06:44:31.910 --> 06:44:31.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:44:35.708 --> 06:44:35.718 align:start position:0%
it representative Sheriff thank you Mr
 
06:44:37.388 --> 06:44:37.398 align:start position:0%
chairman with all due respect from my
 
06:44:39.948 --> 06:44:39.958 align:start position:0%
friend from Newport uh I'm going to join
 
06:44:41.830 --> 06:44:41.840 align:start position:0%
my friend from meramac and vote against
 
06:44:43.708 --> 06:44:43.718 align:start position:0%
this and I'd like to tell the committee
 
06:44:43.718 --> 06:44:45.788 align:start position:0%
this and I'd like to tell the committee
why

06:44:45.788 --> 06:44:45.798 align:start position:0%
why
 
06:44:48.990 --> 06:44:49.000 align:start position:0%
um first of all if I wish this had if
 
06:44:51.510 --> 06:44:51.520 align:start position:0%
they wanted a study it was a house study
 
06:44:55.110 --> 06:44:55.120 align:start position:0%
and not a commission um I looked through
 
06:44:57.310 --> 06:44:57.320 align:start position:0%
the bill because I was really torn over
 
06:45:00.070 --> 06:45:00.080 align:start position:0%
this and I was in the Army at the time
 
06:45:02.750 --> 06:45:02.760 align:start position:0%
this happened and uh and it brings back
 
06:45:05.070 --> 06:45:05.080 align:start position:0%
a lot of sad memories of that
 
06:45:08.230 --> 06:45:08.240 align:start position:0%
time in this commission well first of
 
06:45:11.388 --> 06:45:11.398 align:start position:0%
all both the American Legion and the VFW
 
06:45:14.708 --> 06:45:14.718 align:start position:0%
are opposed to the bill and and I belong
 
06:45:16.788 --> 06:45:16.798 align:start position:0%
to both organization and I respect what
 
06:45:19.350 --> 06:45:19.360 align:start position:0%
they do my other concern looking through
 
06:45:24.388 --> 06:45:24.398 align:start position:0%
this bill they listed that the um a
 
06:45:26.750 --> 06:45:26.760 align:start position:0%
group uh known as the Council of
 
06:45:28.510 --> 06:45:28.520 align:start position:0%
national interest will have a seat on
 
06:45:28.520 --> 06:45:29.548 align:start position:0%
national interest will have a seat on
this

06:45:29.548 --> 06:45:29.558 align:start position:0%
this
 
06:45:33.510 --> 06:45:33.520 align:start position:0%
panel um the executive director of the
 
06:45:36.510 --> 06:45:36.520 align:start position:0%
Council of national interest is a man by
 
06:45:37.868 --> 06:45:37.878 align:start position:0%
the name of Phil
 
06:45:42.030 --> 06:45:42.040 align:start position:0%
Gerard Phil Gera previously served on
 
06:45:45.708 --> 06:45:45.718 align:start position:0%
the um campaign for Palestinian
 
06:45:49.468 --> 06:45:49.478 align:start position:0%
rights uh he was kicked off that group
 
06:45:54.230 --> 06:45:54.240 align:start position:0%
in 2017 because one of the bylaws of the
 
06:45:56.150 --> 06:45:56.160 align:start position:0%
campaign for Palestinian rights as
 
06:45:59.468 --> 06:45:59.478 align:start position:0%
you'll do no comments as anything
 
06:46:02.510 --> 06:46:02.520 align:start position:0%
anti-semitic he wrote an article for a p
 
06:46:06.388 --> 06:46:06.398 align:start position:0%
uh for a magazine uh un's review which
 
06:46:08.468 --> 06:46:08.478 align:start position:0%
the Palestinians felt to be very
 
06:46:10.430 --> 06:46:10.440 align:start position:0%
anti-semitic and kicked them off of that
 
06:46:12.910 --> 06:46:12.920 align:start position:0%
board his group is going to be part of
 
06:46:15.868 --> 06:46:15.878 align:start position:0%
those that are going to be investigating
 
06:46:19.270 --> 06:46:19.280 align:start position:0%
this I wish I wish they had never made
 
06:46:21.868 --> 06:46:21.878 align:start position:0%
this a commission I am troubled by the
 
06:46:24.070 --> 06:46:24.080 align:start position:0%
fact that they have someone who had has
 
06:46:26.150 --> 06:46:26.160 align:start position:0%
a Palestinian Rights group kicked off
 
06:46:28.868 --> 06:46:28.878 align:start position:0%
their board for being anti-semitic I
 
06:46:31.430 --> 06:46:31.440 align:start position:0%
think it brings uh dishonor to those
 
06:46:34.150 --> 06:46:34.160 align:start position:0%
poor veterans who served on the liberty
 
06:46:35.990 --> 06:46:36.000 align:start position:0%
and the fact that there are five
 
06:46:37.990 --> 06:46:38.000 align:start position:0%
represent five members of the
 
06:46:40.110 --> 06:46:40.120 align:start position:0%
legislature and eight people from
 
06:46:42.670 --> 06:46:42.680 align:start position:0%
outside sources on this that means
 
06:46:44.388 --> 06:46:44.398 align:start position:0%
outside sources will have a lot of
 
06:46:46.548 --> 06:46:46.558 align:start position:0%
control over what the final outcome will
 
06:46:50.190 --> 06:46:50.200 align:start position:0%
be and for that reason you know if there
 
06:46:52.110 --> 06:46:52.120 align:start position:0%
was anything to honor those people that
 
06:46:55.430 --> 06:46:55.440 align:start position:0%
served on this ship and to Ser honor my
 
06:46:58.670 --> 06:46:58.680 align:start position:0%
friend son I would support it but having
 
06:47:00.750 --> 06:47:00.760 align:start position:0%
found out about this one connection I
 
06:47:03.110 --> 06:47:03.120 align:start position:0%
cannot vote for this bill and I thank
 
06:47:04.030 --> 06:47:04.040 align:start position:0%
you Mr
 
06:47:06.468 --> 06:47:06.478 align:start position:0%
chair thank you representative I'm not
 
06:47:09.948 --> 06:47:09.958 align:start position:0%
sure who who's you you all okay uh
 
06:47:13.628 --> 06:47:13.638 align:start position:0%
representa M Miller go ahead um I concur
 
06:47:15.670 --> 06:47:15.680 align:start position:0%
I concur with what representative
 
06:47:19.788 --> 06:47:19.798 align:start position:0%
schliff said and also I I'm afraid I
 
06:47:21.430 --> 06:47:21.440 align:start position:0%
don't like the idea of a commission
 
06:47:23.830 --> 06:47:23.840 align:start position:0%
that's for sure um and and I do
 
06:47:26.468 --> 06:47:26.478 align:start position:0%
sympathize with the people that were on
 
06:47:29.868 --> 06:47:29.878 align:start position:0%
the USS Liberty I have a constituent who
 
06:47:33.070 --> 06:47:33.080 align:start position:0%
was on a ship that transported agent
 
06:47:36.670 --> 06:47:36.680 align:start position:0%
orange during Vietnam War and yet the
 
06:47:39.270 --> 06:47:39.280 align:start position:0%
government denied that that happened and
 
06:47:41.230 --> 06:47:41.240 align:start position:0%
so many of the members have come down
 
06:47:44.310 --> 06:47:44.320 align:start position:0%
with fatal cancers and things like that
 
06:47:46.948 --> 06:47:46.958 align:start position:0%
and they can't get any recognition by
 
06:47:49.750 --> 06:47:49.760 align:start position:0%
the US government for medical assistance
 
06:47:52.468 --> 06:47:52.478 align:start position:0%
and stuff like that and it just concerns
 
06:47:56.468 --> 06:47:56.478 align:start position:0%
me that if we do this and and you all
 
06:47:59.070 --> 06:47:59.080 align:start position:0%
deserve to be recognized I I have no
 
06:48:02.430 --> 06:48:02.440 align:start position:0%
problem with that in some way um that
 
06:48:06.468 --> 06:48:06.478 align:start position:0%
will open up all of the wrongs that have
 
06:48:09.430 --> 06:48:09.440 align:start position:0%
been done during that war where other
 
06:48:12.310 --> 06:48:12.320 align:start position:0%
people will seek commission type status
 
06:48:14.750 --> 06:48:14.760 align:start position:0%
to investigate and that's a big concern
 
06:48:16.590 --> 06:48:16.600 align:start position:0%
of mine thank
 
06:48:18.990 --> 06:48:19.000 align:start position:0%
you thank you representative uh
 
06:48:19.000 --> 06:48:20.270 align:start position:0%
you thank you representative uh
representative

06:48:20.270 --> 06:48:20.280 align:start position:0%
representative
 
06:48:23.310 --> 06:48:23.320 align:start position:0%
filot thank you Mr chairman I was not
 
06:48:24.868 --> 06:48:24.878 align:start position:0%
aware of this incident prior to the
 
06:48:27.070 --> 06:48:27.080 align:start position:0%
testimony that we had last week and as I
 
06:48:28.910 --> 06:48:28.920 align:start position:0%
was talking to other people about it who
 
06:48:30.388 --> 06:48:30.398 align:start position:0%
were equally unaware and the the
 
06:48:32.830 --> 06:48:32.840 align:start position:0%
following week the same word came up
 
06:48:34.310 --> 06:48:34.320 align:start position:0%
over and over again which was
 
06:48:37.310 --> 06:48:37.320 align:start position:0%
unconscionable and certainly what
 
06:48:41.030 --> 06:48:41.040 align:start position:0%
happened in the response afterwards was
 
06:48:43.990 --> 06:48:44.000 align:start position:0%
unconscionable and nothing that can be
 
06:48:46.110 --> 06:48:46.120 align:start position:0%
done nothing that can ever be done can
 
06:48:47.830 --> 06:48:47.840 align:start position:0%
take away the unconscionability of what
 
06:48:50.310 --> 06:48:50.320 align:start position:0%
was done or the sacrifices that were
 
06:48:51.948 --> 06:48:51.958 align:start position:0%
made not only by these men but all of
 
06:48:53.868 --> 06:48:53.878 align:start position:0%
our veterans to whom we owe deck that
 
06:48:55.350 --> 06:48:55.360 align:start position:0%
really can never be
 
06:48:58.670 --> 06:48:58.680 align:start position:0%
repaid my only concern is that the
 
06:49:01.628 --> 06:49:01.638 align:start position:0%
central sin of government and law is to
 
06:49:04.590 --> 06:49:04.600 align:start position:0%
give false hope and having sat across
 
06:49:07.590 --> 06:49:07.600 align:start position:0%
from clients and having to had the the
 
06:49:08.990 --> 06:49:09.000 align:start position:0%
tough conversation of saying there's
 
06:49:11.628 --> 06:49:11.638 align:start position:0%
nothing I can do for you I can file a
 
06:49:14.310 --> 06:49:14.320 align:start position:0%
suit but it's going to go nowhere is a
 
06:49:17.070 --> 06:49:17.080 align:start position:0%
tough conversation to have and my fear
 
06:49:18.788 --> 06:49:18.798 align:start position:0%
here is giving false hope for a
 
06:49:21.910 --> 06:49:21.920 align:start position:0%
commission that may go nowhere to lead
 
06:49:23.670 --> 06:49:23.680 align:start position:0%
back to where we are now and not provide
 
06:49:26.548 --> 06:49:26.558 align:start position:0%
the closure that is
 
06:49:30.510 --> 06:49:30.520 align:start position:0%
sought that the commission may seem like
 
06:49:33.830 --> 06:49:33.840 align:start position:0%
the way to go but state power is limited
 
06:49:36.468 --> 06:49:36.478 align:start position:0%
and it may be that other outcomes can
 
06:49:38.868 --> 06:49:38.878 align:start position:0%
provide the closure that state power
 
06:49:42.070 --> 06:49:42.080 align:start position:0%
cannot and that is my concern here I
 
06:49:43.430 --> 06:49:43.440 align:start position:0%
don't know how I'm going to vote yet and
 
06:49:46.510 --> 06:49:46.520 align:start position:0%
welcome to be convinced but I fear
 
06:49:48.350 --> 06:49:48.360 align:start position:0%
providing false hope that we end up in
 
06:49:49.830 --> 06:49:49.840 align:start position:0%
the same position that we are now in a
 
06:49:49.840 --> 06:49:51.628 align:start position:0%
the same position that we are now in a
couple

06:49:51.628 --> 06:49:51.638 align:start position:0%
couple
 
06:49:54.430 --> 06:49:54.440 align:start position:0%
years thank you reprentative represent

comment um
 
06:50:02.868 --> 06:50:02.878 align:start position:0%
wholeheartedly um about the false hope
 
06:50:04.990 --> 06:50:05.000 align:start position:0%
um and how far we can actually go with
 
06:50:07.110 --> 06:50:07.120 align:start position:0%
this and are we just going to get
 
06:50:10.070 --> 06:50:10.080 align:start position:0%
another you know redacted version and
 
06:50:13.788 --> 06:50:13.798 align:start position:0%
not be able to get an unredacted version
 
06:50:16.670 --> 06:50:16.680 align:start position:0%
of of events and things like that that
 
06:50:18.628 --> 06:50:18.638 align:start position:0%
are of National
 
06:50:21.788 --> 06:50:21.798 align:start position:0%
Security and um you know but I just
 
06:50:24.788 --> 06:50:24.798 align:start position:0%
wanted to say that I was extremely
 
06:50:27.868 --> 06:50:27.878 align:start position:0%
honored to have been here last Friday to
 
06:50:32.628 --> 06:50:32.638 align:start position:0%
hear everyone's stories I felt um
 
06:50:36.990 --> 06:50:37.000 align:start position:0%
extremely touched and um it almost
 
06:50:40.708 --> 06:50:40.718 align:start position:0%
brought tears to my eyes that um they
 
06:50:43.750 --> 06:50:43.760 align:start position:0%
were just happy to be able to speak here
 
06:50:47.468 --> 06:50:47.478 align:start position:0%
in front of an official committee about
 
06:50:51.190 --> 06:50:51.200 align:start position:0%
what they went through and I have the
 
06:50:53.910 --> 06:50:53.920 align:start position:0%
utmost respect for them their families
 
06:50:56.590 --> 06:50:56.600 align:start position:0%
especially that are here today as well
 
06:51:01.110 --> 06:51:01.120 align:start position:0%

06:51:04.350 --> 06:51:04.360 align:start position:0%
you thank you representative represent
 
06:51:07.270 --> 06:51:07.280 align:start position:0%
LE your lights on but
 
06:51:09.788 --> 06:51:09.798 align:start position:0%

06:51:12.590 --> 06:51:12.600 align:start position:0%
have your hand okay uh rep represent
 
06:51:15.990 --> 06:51:16.000 align:start position:0%
Lloyd hi thank you um I was just kind of
 
06:51:19.548 --> 06:51:19.558 align:start position:0%
curious um because I I I agree with the
 
06:51:21.270 --> 06:51:21.280 align:start position:0%
sentiment sentiments that have just been
 
06:51:23.388 --> 06:51:23.398 align:start position:0%
shared and then with um with
 
06:51:25.110 --> 06:51:25.120 align:start position:0%
representative shirtliff over there as
 
06:51:25.120 --> 06:51:26.868 align:start position:0%
representative shirtliff over there as
well

06:51:26.868 --> 06:51:26.878 align:start position:0%
well
 
06:51:30.110 --> 06:51:30.120 align:start position:0%
um are there any other options for us
 
06:51:32.270 --> 06:51:32.280 align:start position:0%
with this or or with something similar
 
06:51:35.190 --> 06:51:35.200 align:start position:0%
to workaround uh that we could Pro
 
06:51:37.548 --> 06:51:37.558 align:start position:0%
propose because again I just don't want
 
06:51:41.430 --> 06:51:41.440 align:start position:0%
to um deny these individuals their
 
06:51:47.110 --> 06:51:47.120 align:start position:0%
ability to um to uh try to apply for uh
 
06:51:49.230 --> 06:51:49.240 align:start position:0%
another hearing of some sort and a
 
06:51:51.628 --> 06:51:51.638 align:start position:0%
better investigation that satisfies what
 
06:51:54.110 --> 06:51:54.120 align:start position:0%
they want thank you repres
 
06:51:55.910 --> 06:51:55.920 align:start position:0%
representative Lloyd we have a motion on
 
06:51:58.150 --> 06:51:58.160 align:start position:0%
the floor at the moment which we need to
 
06:52:02.030 --> 06:52:02.040 align:start position:0%
tend to uh shortly um to your point
 
06:52:04.670 --> 06:52:04.680 align:start position:0%
about uh what other options are out
 
06:52:06.788 --> 06:52:06.798 align:start position:0%
there I think that that's something that
 
06:52:09.750 --> 06:52:09.760 align:start position:0%
would need to be discussed or what
 
06:52:12.350 --> 06:52:12.360 align:start position:0%
whatever uh after we tend to the motion
 
06:52:17.270 --> 06:52:17.280 align:start position:0%
on the floor uh I will say uh let me say
 
06:52:21.150 --> 06:52:21.160 align:start position:0%
this um this is a very unique measure um
 
06:52:23.190 --> 06:52:23.200 align:start position:0%
it's very unusual when this came to this
 
06:52:25.388 --> 06:52:25.398 align:start position:0%
committee when I first heard of it I I'm
 
06:52:28.190 --> 06:52:28.200 align:start position:0%
old enough to remember the Six Day War
 
06:52:30.990 --> 06:52:31.000 align:start position:0%
in this incident and uh I know there was
 
06:52:34.510 --> 06:52:34.520 align:start position:0%
one or two Congressional Medals of Honor
 
06:52:38.350 --> 06:52:38.360 align:start position:0%
um so when these gentlemen came from all
 
06:52:41.388 --> 06:52:41.398 align:start position:0%
over the country they were calling me uh
 
06:52:43.708 --> 06:52:43.718 align:start position:0%
for whatever reason asking how to get
 
06:52:46.070 --> 06:52:46.080 align:start position:0%
here from Baltimore or from Missouri or
 
06:52:49.948 --> 06:52:49.958 align:start position:0%
from Colorado so the fact that these
 
06:52:55.590 --> 06:52:55.600 align:start position:0%
guys uh wanted to come here and testify
 
06:52:58.868 --> 06:52:58.878 align:start position:0%
because this this Mo this measure was
 
06:53:04.230 --> 06:53:04.240 align:start position:0%
put in um was very moving and um and I
 
06:53:06.110 --> 06:53:06.120 align:start position:0%
told the prime sponsor ahead of time I
 
06:53:08.190 --> 06:53:08.200 align:start position:0%
said we have limited time to tend to
 
06:53:10.750 --> 06:53:10.760 align:start position:0%
this I want these guys to be taken care
 
06:53:12.628 --> 06:53:12.638 align:start position:0%
of and I made sure that there was
 
06:53:14.590 --> 06:53:14.600 align:start position:0%
something downstairs where they could
 
06:53:17.230 --> 06:53:17.240 align:start position:0%
talk uh once they were
 
06:53:21.510 --> 06:53:21.520 align:start position:0%
here uh I think um that we gave them a
 
06:53:24.750 --> 06:53:24.760 align:start position:0%
gift um by giving them our ears and our
 
06:53:27.628 --> 06:53:27.638 align:start position:0%
eyes uh I do not know how how this is
 
06:53:29.590 --> 06:53:29.600 align:start position:0%
going to this is a very unique measure
 
06:53:32.270 --> 06:53:32.280 align:start position:0%
uh I do not know it's a vulture
 
06:53:35.030 --> 06:53:35.040 align:start position:0%
conscience measure I I do not know how
 
06:53:38.590 --> 06:53:38.600 align:start position:0%
it's going to come out to your point uh
 
06:53:40.548 --> 06:53:40.558 align:start position:0%
however it comes out uh there there will
 
06:53:43.430 --> 06:53:43.440 align:start position:0%
be an option uh I can tell that it's
 
06:53:45.388 --> 06:53:45.398 align:start position:0%
going to be a a split vote don't know
 
06:53:47.110 --> 06:53:47.120 align:start position:0%
what it's going to be it will go to the
 
06:53:50.350 --> 06:53:50.360 align:start position:0%
house and uh there may be something that
 
06:53:53.750 --> 06:53:53.760 align:start position:0%
can be done there or not uh that's later
 
06:53:56.670 --> 06:53:56.680 align:start position:0%
for now we need to U vote on the motion
 
06:54:01.150 --> 06:54:01.160 align:start position:0%
on the floor uh this is uh presumably on
 
06:54:04.030 --> 06:54:04.040 align:start position:0%
on YouTube uh and maybe the gentlemen
 
06:54:05.990 --> 06:54:06.000 align:start position:0%
and their families and many others are
 
06:54:09.788 --> 06:54:09.798 align:start position:0%
are watching and I think I hope that the
 
06:54:12.030 --> 06:54:12.040 align:start position:0%
fact that we're paying attention to them
 
06:54:15.628 --> 06:54:15.638 align:start position:0%
in this fashion in ways that uh others
 
06:54:19.310 --> 06:54:19.320 align:start position:0%
have not for decades uh I hope is a gift
 
06:54:24.270 --> 06:54:24.280 align:start position:0%
to them because uh whatever happens
 
06:54:28.110 --> 06:54:28.120 align:start position:0%
people know many people know about this
 
06:54:32.070 --> 06:54:32.080 align:start position:0%
incident who did not know about it uh
 
06:54:35.388 --> 06:54:35.398 align:start position:0%
and yes there's some been some
 
06:54:38.110 --> 06:54:38.120 align:start position:0%
wonderful uh comments and discussion
 
06:54:40.948 --> 06:54:40.958 align:start position:0%
points uh on both sides that I think are
 
06:54:44.948 --> 06:54:44.958 align:start position:0%
very fair uh commissions uh you
 
06:54:47.510 --> 06:54:47.520 align:start position:0%
know represent Sher made some excellent
 
06:54:49.708 --> 06:54:49.718 align:start position:0%
points about some issues with the makeup
 
06:54:51.468 --> 06:54:51.478 align:start position:0%
of the commission and we want to be
 
06:54:53.388 --> 06:54:53.398 align:start position:0%
careful about commissions and committing
 
06:54:55.948 --> 06:54:55.958 align:start position:0%
time and resources and I think
 
06:54:58.190 --> 06:54:58.200 align:start position:0%
representative philo's point was
 
06:55:02.510 --> 06:55:02.520 align:start position:0%
excellent about the false hope thing um
 
06:55:04.830 --> 06:55:04.840 align:start position:0%
but my my point is this is a vulture
 
06:55:06.830 --> 06:55:06.840 align:start position:0%
conscious thing we'll run the role
 
06:55:11.510 --> 06:55:11.520 align:start position:0%
momentarily um I want the survivors who
 
06:55:13.708 --> 06:55:13.718 align:start position:0%
I know are watching or will watch to
 
06:55:17.590 --> 06:55:17.600 align:start position:0%
know that uh we all heard them uh a lot
 
06:55:19.430 --> 06:55:19.440 align:start position:0%
of people are going to get smarter about
 
06:55:21.788 --> 06:55:21.798 align:start position:0%
this uh their stories need to be
 
06:55:26.350 --> 06:55:26.360 align:start position:0%
remembered representative Rollin son um
 
06:55:30.830 --> 06:55:30.840 align:start position:0%
out of this uh is on our minds and his
 
06:55:34.030 --> 06:55:34.040 align:start position:0%
spirit and memory stays alive because of
 
06:55:37.350 --> 06:55:37.360 align:start position:0%
this motion that that's something that
 
06:55:38.708 --> 06:55:38.718 align:start position:0%
uh who
 
06:55:42.150 --> 06:55:42.160 align:start position:0%
knew so uh it's a vure concious thing I
 
06:55:45.190 --> 06:55:45.200 align:start position:0%
do not know how it's going to go um
 
06:55:47.590 --> 06:55:47.600 align:start position:0%
those are my quick thoughts um does
 
06:55:50.430 --> 06:55:50.440 align:start position:0%
anyone else uh representative Lev thank
 
06:55:53.230 --> 06:55:53.240 align:start position:0%
you chair Mett so after the debate
 
06:55:54.788 --> 06:55:54.798 align:start position:0%
everybody here would agree this I might
 
06:55:57.910 --> 06:55:57.920 align:start position:0%
answered questions that's without a
 
06:55:59.910 --> 06:55:59.920 align:start position:0%
doubt I think there should be an
 
06:56:02.948 --> 06:56:02.958 align:start position:0%
appropriate motion made after the vote
 
06:56:02.958 --> 06:56:05.190 align:start position:0%
appropriate motion made after the vote
thank

06:56:05.190 --> 06:56:05.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:56:08.548 --> 06:56:08.558 align:start position:0%
you uh representative
 
06:56:12.388 --> 06:56:12.398 align:start position:0%
B thank you Mr chair yeah I have a
 
06:56:13.830 --> 06:56:13.840 align:start position:0%
problem with the makeup of the
 
06:56:15.868 --> 06:56:15.878 align:start position:0%
commission as representative Sherl
 
06:56:18.468 --> 06:56:18.478 align:start position:0%
mentioned but
 
06:56:21.070 --> 06:56:21.080 align:start position:0%
remember a floor amendment can be done
 
06:56:22.788 --> 06:56:22.798 align:start position:0%
and also it's got to go to the Senate
 
06:56:25.150 --> 06:56:25.160 align:start position:0%
where those changes could be made but
 
06:56:27.788 --> 06:56:27.798 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm yeah it's up in the air to me
 
06:56:29.708 --> 06:56:29.718 align:start position:0%
because yeah I don't like the commission
 
06:56:32.590 --> 06:56:32.600 align:start position:0%
make up with somebody with an
 
06:56:36.510 --> 06:56:36.520 align:start position:0%
anti-Semitism um conscience so yeah I'm
 
06:56:39.990 --> 06:56:40.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:56:42.468 --> 06:56:42.478 align:start position:0%
happens uh represent
 
06:56:44.388 --> 06:56:44.398 align:start position:0%
Rollins yes you said you didn't know
 
06:56:46.468 --> 06:56:46.478 align:start position:0%
whether anybody be watching I'm not sure
 
06:56:48.270 --> 06:56:48.280 align:start position:0%
whether they are or not but I did
 
06:56:50.190 --> 06:56:50.200 align:start position:0%
contact Reverend Bryce Lockwood
 
06:56:53.270 --> 06:56:53.280 align:start position:0%
yesterday by email and told him that we
 
06:56:55.670 --> 06:56:55.680 align:start position:0%
may ex this this afternoon if we had
 
06:56:58.388 --> 06:56:58.398 align:start position:0%
time and I will follow through with a
 
06:57:01.510 --> 06:57:01.520 align:start position:0%
phone call to him immediately after this
 
06:57:03.190 --> 06:57:03.200 align:start position:0%
committee is done today so he'll know
 
06:57:05.350 --> 06:57:05.360 align:start position:0%
where he stands and know what the count
 
06:57:07.590 --> 06:57:07.600 align:start position:0%
is going into the going into onto the
 
06:57:07.600 --> 06:57:08.548 align:start position:0%
is going into the going into onto the
house

06:57:08.548 --> 06:57:08.558 align:start position:0%
house
 
06:57:11.270 --> 06:57:11.280 align:start position:0%
floor and I'm sure he has shared it with
 
06:57:14.430 --> 06:57:14.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:57:16.910 --> 06:57:16.920 align:start position:0%
I thank you repon
 
06:57:20.110 --> 06:57:20.120 align:start position:0%
Rollins uh any other comments uh
 
06:57:21.830 --> 06:57:21.840 align:start position:0%
representative Manion this one's real
 
06:57:23.270 --> 06:57:23.280 align:start position:0%
quick one thing I would say it's like
 
06:57:25.350 --> 06:57:25.360 align:start position:0%
the the anti-Semitism and the Israel
 
06:57:27.070 --> 06:57:27.080 align:start position:0%
thing to me the failure is from the
 
06:57:29.110 --> 06:57:29.120 align:start position:0%
United States government here more than
 
06:57:33.350 --> 06:57:33.360 align:start position:0%
anything like I I that's my take
 
06:57:37.070 --> 06:57:37.080 align:start position:0%
here anything else so I have a quick
 
06:57:38.590 --> 06:57:38.600 align:start position:0%
question only because of something
 
06:57:41.070 --> 06:57:41.080 align:start position:0%
representative Rollin said he said it
 
06:57:45.548 --> 06:57:45.558 align:start position:0%
was a resolution but it's in fact a bill
 
06:57:49.190 --> 06:57:49.200 align:start position:0%
oh a house bill sorry yeah yeah correct
 
06:57:50.468 --> 06:57:50.478 align:start position:0%
it's a bill to create a commission
 
06:57:52.910 --> 06:57:52.920 align:start position:0%
correct okay yeah all right so I think
 
06:57:55.548 --> 06:57:55.558 align:start position:0%
you know some folks may feel differently
 
06:57:59.070 --> 06:57:59.080 align:start position:0%
if it was a resolution versus a
 
06:57:59.080 --> 06:58:02.388 align:start position:0%
if it was a resolution versus a
commission

06:58:02.388 --> 06:58:02.398 align:start position:0%
 
06:58:05.548 --> 06:58:05.558 align:start position:0%
yeah that that's a a good point an
 
06:58:07.190 --> 06:58:07.200 align:start position:0%
interesting point if it were a
 
06:58:09.948 --> 06:58:09.958 align:start position:0%
resolution that would be obviously a
 
06:58:12.548 --> 06:58:12.558 align:start position:0%
different Dynamic than than a house bill
 
06:58:14.388 --> 06:58:14.398 align:start position:0%
that would require a
 
06:58:17.590 --> 06:58:17.600 align:start position:0%
commission anything
 
06:58:20.310 --> 06:58:20.320 align:start position:0%
else okay we need to uh attend to the
 
06:58:21.830 --> 06:58:21.840 align:start position:0%
motion on the floor the motion on the
 
06:58:25.430 --> 06:58:25.440 align:start position:0%
floor is uh is
 
06:58:27.990 --> 06:58:28.000 align:start position:0%

question do we have an alternative to
 
07:00:10.350 --> 07:00:10.360 align:start position:0%
putting it given that this is the second
 
07:00:12.788 --> 07:00:12.798 align:start position:0%
year of the term do we have an an option
 
07:00:14.788 --> 07:00:14.798 align:start position:0%
other than itl for this bill at least at
 
07:00:17.070 --> 07:00:17.080 align:start position:0%
this point terms uh representative
 
07:00:20.830 --> 07:00:20.840 align:start position:0%
shirtliff uh please thank you uh Mr
 
07:00:22.510 --> 07:00:22.520 align:start position:0%
chairman what I would recommend amend is
 
07:00:26.150 --> 07:00:26.160 align:start position:0%
that we table any further action on this
 
07:00:27.868 --> 07:00:27.878 align:start position:0%
bill for now we're going to be meeting I
 
07:00:30.310 --> 07:00:30.320 align:start position:0%
believe in a week or so and I think in
 
07:00:32.788 --> 07:00:32.798 align:start position:0%
the interim if we could come up with a
 
07:00:32.798 --> 07:00:34.948 align:start position:0%
the interim if we could come up with a
uh

07:00:34.948 --> 07:00:34.958 align:start position:0%
uh
 
07:00:38.990 --> 07:00:39.000 align:start position:0%
uh um a resolution simply honoring the
 
07:00:41.388 --> 07:00:41.398 align:start position:0%
men on the USS Liberty and their service
 
07:00:43.868 --> 07:00:43.878 align:start position:0%

say if you wanted just to vote uh to
 
07:01:27.788 --> 07:01:27.798 align:start position:0%

talk to the clerk even and get his
 
07:01:32.708 --> 07:01:32.718 align:start position:0%
Insight is the best way to go but not
 
07:01:34.350 --> 07:01:34.360 align:start position:0%
take any further action today and not
 
07:01:36.030 --> 07:01:36.040 align:start position:0%

bill we cannot retain the the options uh
 
07:02:12.110 --> 07:02:12.120 align:start position:0%
would be OTP having failed we could look
 
07:02:14.030 --> 07:02:14.040 align:start position:0%
at an interim study option we could look
 
07:02:17.430 --> 07:02:17.440 align:start position:0%
at a itl option uh but for now we're not
 
07:02:18.750 --> 07:02:18.760 align:start position:0%
going to look at any option we're going
 
07:02:21.110 --> 07:02:21.120 align:start position:0%
to come back to that that's uh that uh
 
07:02:23.230 --> 07:02:23.240 align:start position:0%

speaker if he thinks the appropriate
 
07:02:30.230 --> 07:02:30.240 align:start position:0%
thing is to recess this executive
 
07:02:33.388 --> 07:02:33.398 align:start position:0%
session at this time that was my
 
07:02:35.270 --> 07:02:35.280 align:start position:0%
suggestion to recess the talk with the

07:02:42.430 --> 07:02:42.440 align:start position:0%
we wanted to attend to uh can can we
 
07:02:44.670 --> 07:02:44.680 align:start position:0%

recess the hearing on
 
07:02:50.510 --> 07:02:50.520 align:start position:0%
this to to our next meeting I think it's
 
07:02:52.910 --> 07:02:52.920 align:start position:0%
February 2nd
 
07:02:55.430 --> 07:02:55.440 align:start position:0%
yes that's uh my intent and that's what
 
07:02:58.350 --> 07:02:58.360 align:start position:0%
I will do is that uh before I do that

that we will do exactly that we will
 
07:03:19.030 --> 07:03:19.040 align:start position:0%

economic justice issue and we should
 
07:04:21.270 --> 07:04:21.280 align:start position:0%

of uh
 
07:04:52.708 --> 07:04:52.718 align:start position:0%
OTP on uh cacr
 
07:04:54.468 --> 07:04:54.478 align:start position:0%
uh I want to
 
07:04:57.310 --> 07:04:57.320 align:start position:0%
mention uh to the to the committee uh
 
07:04:59.510 --> 07:04:59.520 align:start position:0%
one of my concerns on this had to do and
 
07:05:03.270 --> 07:05:03.280 align:start position:0%
I mention this dur during the hearing uh
 
07:05:05.628 --> 07:05:05.638 align:start position:0%
was with regard to
 
07:05:08.388 --> 07:05:08.398 align:start position:0%
Corrections and would If This Were to
 
07:05:09.910 --> 07:05:09.920 align:start position:0%
move forward if it were to become part
 
07:05:12.350 --> 07:05:12.360 align:start position:0%
of the Constitution would that hamstring
 
07:05:16.990 --> 07:05:17.000 align:start position:0%
or would it would it uh have a make it
 
07:05:19.350 --> 07:05:19.360 align:start position:0%
difficult for the corrections people to
 
07:05:22.628 --> 07:05:22.638 align:start position:0%
have uh incarcerated people do things
 
07:05:25.510 --> 07:05:25.520 align:start position:0%
without being uh subject to lawsuits for
 
07:05:28.310 --> 07:05:28.320 align:start position:0%
breaking the Constitution so
 
07:05:31.788 --> 07:05:31.798 align:start position:0%
I reached out and I got and I think I
 
07:05:33.388 --> 07:05:33.398 align:start position:0%
believe I sent this I shared this with
 
07:05:35.468 --> 07:05:35.478 align:start position:0%
committee members I got an opinion from
 
07:05:37.190 --> 07:05:37.200 align:start position:0%
the uh Commissioner of Department of
 
07:05:41.548 --> 07:05:41.558 align:start position:0%
Corrections from do uh Helen Hanks and
 
07:05:45.990 --> 07:05:46.000 align:start position:0%
uh she not only said that she uh had no
 
07:05:49.030 --> 07:05:49.040 align:start position:0%
problem with the measure but she
 
07:05:51.270 --> 07:05:51.280 align:start position:0%
actually uh enthusiastically supported
 
07:05:54.110 --> 07:05:54.120 align:start position:0%
it so that made a big difference for me
 
07:05:58.070 --> 07:05:58.080 align:start position:0%
were she have were were she had to were
 
07:06:00.070 --> 07:06:00.080 align:start position:0%
she to have said that this with
 
07:06:01.910 --> 07:06:01.920 align:start position:0%
hamstring Corrections and that's
 
07:06:03.548 --> 07:06:03.558 align:start position:0%
something that I think I would have had
 
07:06:05.868 --> 07:06:05.878 align:start position:0%
had wanted to spend more time on but
 
07:06:08.270 --> 07:06:08.280 align:start position:0%
given what I heard what we heard from
 
07:06:10.468 --> 07:06:10.478 align:start position:0%
Corrections commissioner uh that's not
 
07:06:12.670 --> 07:06:12.680 align:start position:0%
an issue for me that was my issue and
 
07:06:19.670 --> 07:06:19.680 align:start position:0%
 
07:06:23.070 --> 07:06:23.080 align:start position:0%
