00:16:52.310 --> 00:16:52.320 align:start position:0%
question and a suggestion with regard to

representative griffin who's apparently
 
00:16:55.670 --> 00:16:55.680 align:start position:0%
unable to
 
00:16:59.269 --> 00:16:59.279 align:start position:0%

consensus of the committee
 
00:17:05.350 --> 00:17:05.360 align:start position:0%

her voice
 
00:17:10.150 --> 00:17:10.160 align:start position:0%
so we have recognition there and uh
 
00:17:13.590 --> 00:17:13.600 align:start position:0%
as an exception to the rule that uh
 
00:17:16.829 --> 00:17:16.839 align:start position:0%
you're properly enforcing in all other
 
00:17:16.839 --> 00:17:18.549 align:start position:0%
you're properly enforcing in all other
respects

00:17:18.549 --> 00:17:18.559 align:start position:0%
respects
 
00:17:21.750 --> 00:17:21.760 align:start position:0%

00:17:31.510 --> 00:17:31.520 align:start position:0%
but you've got to be able to see the
 
00:17:31.520 --> 00:17:34.630 align:start position:0%
but you've got to be able to see the
person

00:17:34.630 --> 00:17:34.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:38.710 --> 00:17:38.720 align:start position:0%
i i agree with you representations
 
00:17:41.750 --> 00:17:41.760 align:start position:0%
and i try to make that happen
 
00:17:44.150 --> 00:17:44.160 align:start position:0%
well thank you for that and i regret
 
00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:45.029 align:start position:0%
well thank you for that and i regret
that

00:17:45.029 --> 00:17:45.039 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:17:47.909 --> 00:17:47.919 align:start position:0%
we're in this situation it's it's most
 
00:17:47.919 --> 00:17:49.350 align:start position:0%
we're in this situation it's it's most
unfortunate

00:17:49.350 --> 00:17:49.360 align:start position:0%
unfortunate
 
00:17:52.470 --> 00:17:52.480 align:start position:0%
it certainly is i tried as well
 
00:17:53.669 --> 00:17:53.679 align:start position:0%
representative major
 
00:17:55.270 --> 00:17:55.280 align:start position:0%
couldn't make the chairs meeting on
 
00:17:58.150 --> 00:17:58.160 align:start position:0%
monday i brought that up as well
 
00:18:01.590 --> 00:18:01.600 align:start position:0%
uh to the speaker and uh
 
00:18:03.669 --> 00:18:03.679 align:start position:0%
he took it under consideration but i
 
00:18:05.669 --> 00:18:05.679 align:start position:0%
think as representative major said
 
00:18:07.430 --> 00:18:07.440 align:start position:0%
it was he had wanted to start making
 
00:18:09.510 --> 00:18:09.520 align:start position:0%
exceptions and i used the same argument
 
00:18:09.990 --> 00:18:10.000 align:start position:0%
you did
 
00:18:12.870 --> 00:18:12.880 align:start position:0%
we all recognize her and i suggested it
 
00:18:12.880 --> 00:18:13.190 align:start position:0%
we all recognize her and i suggested it
if

00:18:13.190 --> 00:18:13.200 align:start position:0%
if
 
00:18:16.310 --> 00:18:16.320 align:start position:0%
if all the members of the committee
 
00:18:18.789 --> 00:18:18.799 align:start position:0%
agreed it was something that we should
 
00:18:19.990 --> 00:18:20.000 align:start position:0%
allow but
 
00:18:22.470 --> 00:18:22.480 align:start position:0%
you know didn't go anywhere i agree with
 
00:18:23.990 --> 00:18:24.000 align:start position:0%
you too dick
 
00:18:27.110 --> 00:18:27.120 align:start position:0%

00:18:30.470 --> 00:18:30.480 align:start position:0%
us as anybody else's so
 
00:18:32.230 --> 00:18:32.240 align:start position:0%
that's just that's what the rule is
 
00:18:40.830 --> 00:18:40.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:40.840 --> 00:18:43.909 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:18:43.909 --> 00:18:43.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:54.830 --> 00:18:54.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:54.840 --> 00:19:01.830 align:start position:0%
 
324.

00:19:01.830 --> 00:19:01.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:04.150 --> 00:19:04.160 align:start position:0%
house bill 324 relative to the
 
00:19:06.549 --> 00:19:06.559 align:start position:0%
administration of certain state taxes by
 
00:19:09.830 --> 00:19:09.840 align:start position:0%
the department of revenue administration
 
00:19:13.190 --> 00:19:13.200 align:start position:0%
this is a housekeeping bill
 
00:19:18.230 --> 00:19:18.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:22.950 --> 00:19:22.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:25.350 --> 00:19:25.360 align:start position:0%
making the motion so this is a reminder
 
00:19:26.310 --> 00:19:26.320 align:start position:0%
it does four things
 
00:19:27.909 --> 00:19:27.919 align:start position:0%
clarifies electronic following emails
 
00:19:29.830 --> 00:19:29.840 align:start position:0%
rooms taxes excel
 
00:19:32.870 --> 00:19:32.880 align:start position:0%
excludes interest for the 30-day period
 
00:19:34.630 --> 00:19:34.640 align:start position:0%
after notice of assessment of state
 
00:19:34.640 --> 00:19:35.990 align:start position:0%
after notice of assessment of state
taxes

00:19:35.990 --> 00:19:36.000 align:start position:0%
taxes
 
00:19:38.470 --> 00:19:38.480 align:start position:0%
for amounts paid within 30 day period
 
00:19:39.590 --> 00:19:39.600 align:start position:0%
removes the
 
00:19:41.350 --> 00:19:41.360 align:start position:0%
consideration of weighted apportionment
 
00:19:43.669 --> 00:19:43.679 align:start position:0%
factors under the business profits tax
 
00:19:45.590 --> 00:19:45.600 align:start position:0%
from exclusion in the tax exemption
 
00:19:45.600 --> 00:19:46.549 align:start position:0%
from exclusion in the tax exemption
report

00:19:46.549 --> 00:19:46.559 align:start position:0%
report
 
00:19:47.909 --> 00:19:47.919 align:start position:0%
and the fourth thing it does is it
 
00:19:50.390 --> 00:19:50.400 align:start position:0%
provides for conformity and business tax
 
00:19:51.350 --> 00:19:51.360 align:start position:0%
filing dates
 
00:19:53.990 --> 00:19:54.000 align:start position:0%
on nonprofit corporations and in this
 
00:19:55.350 --> 00:19:55.360 align:start position:0%
state with the united states internal
 
00:19:57.909 --> 00:19:57.919 align:start position:0%
revenue code filing dates
 
00:19:59.510 --> 00:19:59.520 align:start position:0%
and we really didn't have much
 
00:20:01.669 --> 00:20:01.679 align:start position:0%
discussion about this or
 
00:20:04.390 --> 00:20:04.400 align:start position:0%
uh when we heard the bill presented by
 
00:20:04.400 --> 00:20:05.029 align:start position:0%

uh yes i do house bill 354 is about the
 
00:25:06.390 --> 00:25:06.400 align:start position:0%
problem of
 
00:25:10.950 --> 00:25:10.960 align:start position:0%
liability the present wording says
 
00:25:14.230 --> 00:25:14.240 align:start position:0%
we are liable
 
00:25:16.230 --> 00:25:16.240 align:start position:0%
but that term is not very clear as to
 
00:25:17.269 --> 00:25:17.279 align:start position:0%
who we
 
00:25:19.990 --> 00:25:20.000 align:start position:0%
is the new wording is an attempt to make
 
00:25:22.070 --> 00:25:22.080 align:start position:0%
it perfectly clear
 
00:25:25.269 --> 00:25:25.279 align:start position:0%
that the town or city is the liable
 
00:25:28.230 --> 00:25:28.240 align:start position:0%
entity so in the case of my hometown

00:34:55.109 --> 00:34:55.119 align:start position:0%
i think there's still too many unknown
 
00:34:57.190 --> 00:34:57.200 align:start position:0%
factors that can affect
 
00:35:00.790 --> 00:35:00.800 align:start position:0%
the revenue projections um now how long
 
00:35:01.990 --> 00:35:02.000 align:start position:0%
will it take to move beyond
 
00:35:05.190 --> 00:35:05.200 align:start position:0%
the many impacts of the covid pandemic
 
00:35:08.069 --> 00:35:08.079 align:start position:0%
uh the timeline for public vaccination
 
00:35:09.910 --> 00:35:09.920 align:start position:0%

00:35:11.750 --> 00:35:11.760 align:start position:0%
some people are not following safety

00:35:23.910 --> 00:35:23.920 align:start position:0%
new hampshire economy will rebound
 
00:35:25.750 --> 00:35:25.760 align:start position:0%
the business tax picture is further
 
00:35:28.069 --> 00:35:28.079 align:start position:0%
complicated by the upcoming shift to
 
00:35:29.670 --> 00:35:29.680 align:start position:0%
market-based sourcing
 
00:35:31.670 --> 00:35:31.680 align:start position:0%
and the future use of the single sales
 
00:35:31.680 --> 00:35:33.190 align:start position:0%
and the future use of the single sales
factors

00:35:33.190 --> 00:35:33.200 align:start position:0%
factors
 
00:35:34.710 --> 00:35:34.720 align:start position:0%
with all the above questions still
 
00:35:37.510 --> 00:35:37.520 align:start position:0%
unanswered it seems prudent to maintain
 
00:35:39.510 --> 00:35:39.520 align:start position:0%
the current business tax percentages
 
00:35:42.950 --> 00:35:42.960 align:start position:0%
for the next biennium thank you
 
00:35:46.550 --> 00:35:46.560 align:start position:0%
thank you representative southwest
 
00:35:51.030 --> 00:35:51.040 align:start position:0%
representative thank you mr chairman
 
00:35:54.310 --> 00:35:54.320 align:start position:0%
on we we really don't have
 
00:35:57.030 --> 00:35:57.040 align:start position:0%
any idea yet what the next 12 months and
 
00:35:58.390 --> 00:35:58.400 align:start position:0%
the next budget
 
00:36:01.670 --> 00:36:01.680 align:start position:0%
is our term is going to bring
 
00:36:05.030 --> 00:36:05.040 align:start position:0%
on there are the medical community
 
00:36:06.950 --> 00:36:06.960 align:start position:0%
thinks that the variance
 
00:36:09.510 --> 00:36:09.520 align:start position:0%
on that we're going to end up in a race
 
00:36:11.349 --> 00:36:11.359 align:start position:0%
with the variants to get enough people
 
00:36:11.359 --> 00:36:12.230 align:start position:0%
with the variants to get enough people
vaccinated

00:36:12.230 --> 00:36:12.240 align:start position:0%
vaccinated
 
00:36:15.589 --> 00:36:15.599 align:start position:0%
so that they will not be mutating and
 
00:36:15.599 --> 00:36:17.190 align:start position:0%
so that they will not be mutating and
spreading

00:36:17.190 --> 00:36:17.200 align:start position:0%
spreading
 
00:36:19.910 --> 00:36:19.920 align:start position:0%
all over the country they are spreading
 
00:36:21.670 --> 00:36:21.680 align:start position:0%
in other parts of the world
 
00:36:25.510 --> 00:36:25.520 align:start position:0%
at this point and that has a huge
 
00:36:27.910 --> 00:36:27.920 align:start position:0%
effect on our economy and when we can
 
00:36:28.870 --> 00:36:28.880 align:start position:0%
start to come
 
00:36:33.030 --> 00:36:33.040 align:start position:0%
out of the coved era on
 
00:36:35.109 --> 00:36:35.119 align:start position:0%
both market-based sourcing and the
 
00:36:36.550 --> 00:36:36.560 align:start position:0%
single sales factor
 
00:36:39.910 --> 00:36:39.920 align:start position:0%
our current law on we're going to have
 
00:36:39.920 --> 00:36:40.630 align:start position:0%
our current law on we're going to have
to

00:36:40.630 --> 00:36:40.640 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:36:43.750 --> 00:36:43.760 align:start position:0%
take a wild stab at what they do when we
 
00:36:45.510 --> 00:36:45.520 align:start position:0%
do our revenue estimates
 
00:36:47.829 --> 00:36:47.839 align:start position:0%
that goes to the budget the budget is
 
00:36:49.430 --> 00:36:49.440 align:start position:0%
then going to add
 
00:36:53.670 --> 00:36:53.680 align:start position:0%
this i presume on end
 
00:36:57.030 --> 00:36:57.040 align:start position:0%
and we we will have an extremely
 
00:37:00.950 --> 00:37:00.960 align:start position:0%
risky on balance between
 
00:37:05.030 --> 00:37:05.040 align:start position:0%
expenditures and revenues
 
00:37:08.550 --> 00:37:08.560 align:start position:0%
when we get there uh
 
00:37:11.349 --> 00:37:11.359 align:start position:0%
at the bia summit this fall business
 
00:37:13.589 --> 00:37:13.599 align:start position:0%
ceos revealed that they are told by
 
00:37:14.550 --> 00:37:14.560 align:start position:0%
their accountants
 
00:37:17.670 --> 00:37:17.680 align:start position:0%
only what their total tax burden is not
 
00:37:18.550 --> 00:37:18.560 align:start position:0%
how much of it
 
00:37:21.510 --> 00:37:21.520 align:start position:0%
is federal taxes state taxes municipal
 
00:37:21.520 --> 00:37:21.990 align:start position:0%
is federal taxes state taxes municipal
property

00:37:21.990 --> 00:37:22.000 align:start position:0%
property
 
00:37:25.670 --> 00:37:25.680 align:start position:0%
taxes water district taxes or whatever
 
00:37:27.990 --> 00:37:28.000 align:start position:0%
it is also not near the top of their
 
00:37:29.430 --> 00:37:29.440 align:start position:0%
list of priorities
 
00:37:33.270 --> 00:37:33.280 align:start position:0%
in fact on average in 2019 slightly over
 
00:37:35.270 --> 00:37:35.280 align:start position:0%
half of their state and local
 
00:37:38.470 --> 00:37:38.480 align:start position:0%
tax and fee burden was property tax and
 
00:37:40.069 --> 00:37:40.079 align:start position:0%
less than a quarter of it was our
 
00:37:42.390 --> 00:37:42.400 align:start position:0%
business taxes
 
00:37:44.710 --> 00:37:44.720 align:start position:0%
the property tax share has been growing
 
00:37:46.230 --> 00:37:46.240 align:start position:0%
over the years
 
00:37:48.710 --> 00:37:48.720 align:start position:0%
as we cut state business taxes and
 
00:37:49.990 --> 00:37:50.000 align:start position:0%
shifted the cost to the
 
00:37:53.829 --> 00:37:53.839 align:start position:0%
towns our largest state level
 
00:37:56.550 --> 00:37:56.560 align:start position:0%
revenue source is paid overwhelmingly by
 
00:37:58.310 --> 00:37:58.320 align:start position:0%
multi-state and multinational
 
00:37:58.320 --> 00:37:59.430 align:start position:0%
multi-state and multinational
corporations

00:37:59.430 --> 00:37:59.440 align:start position:0%
corporations
 
00:38:01.750 --> 00:38:01.760 align:start position:0%
that regard new hampshire's taxes as
 
00:38:03.030 --> 00:38:03.040 align:start position:0%
very low on their
 
00:38:05.990 --> 00:38:06.000 align:start position:0%
list of reasons to operate here there
 
00:38:07.190 --> 00:38:07.200 align:start position:0%
are well over half
 
00:38:09.030 --> 00:38:09.040 align:start position:0%
of the state's businesses that have no
 
00:38:11.030 --> 00:38:11.040 align:start position:0%
tax liability at all
 
00:38:13.750 --> 00:38:13.760 align:start position:0%
for the business taxes and an unknowable
 
00:38:17.030 --> 00:38:17.040 align:start position:0%
number of them do not even file
 
00:38:20.870 --> 00:38:20.880 align:start position:0%
uh so you're aiming this tax
 
00:38:23.910 --> 00:38:23.920 align:start position:0%
decrease at businesses that really
 
00:38:26.069 --> 00:38:26.079 align:start position:0%
aren't paying attention
 
00:38:29.990 --> 00:38:30.000 align:start position:0%
to it on and further reduction of those
 
00:38:31.030 --> 00:38:31.040 align:start position:0%
business taxes
 
00:38:33.589 --> 00:38:33.599 align:start position:0%
is counterproductive both to our economy
 
00:38:35.990 --> 00:38:36.000 align:start position:0%
and to our citizenry
 
00:38:38.710 --> 00:38:38.720 align:start position:0%
because of this shift somebody has to
 
00:38:38.720 --> 00:38:39.270 align:start position:0%
because of this shift somebody has to
pay

00:38:39.270 --> 00:38:39.280 align:start position:0%
pay
 
00:38:41.750 --> 00:38:41.760 align:start position:0%
for the state government and for the
 
00:38:43.109 --> 00:38:43.119 align:start position:0%
town governments
 
00:38:45.270 --> 00:38:45.280 align:start position:0%
and we are sending more and more of that
 
00:38:47.670 --> 00:38:47.680 align:start position:0%
burden down to the town governments
 
00:38:52.390 --> 00:38:52.400 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you representative
 
00:38:55.510 --> 00:38:55.520 align:start position:0%
representative romney yeah thank you
 
00:38:58.310 --> 00:38:58.320 align:start position:0%
mr chair um yeah this brings us back to
 
00:38:59.829 --> 00:38:59.839 align:start position:0%
the house position of a couple of years
 
00:38:59.839 --> 00:39:01.270 align:start position:0%
the house position of a couple of years
ago

00:39:01.270 --> 00:39:01.280 align:start position:0%
ago
 
00:39:03.990 --> 00:39:04.000 align:start position:0%
as you know that in the last budget uh
 
00:39:05.190 --> 00:39:05.200 align:start position:0%
the compromise
 
00:39:07.670 --> 00:39:07.680 align:start position:0%
was triggers six percent i think it was
 
00:39:09.030 --> 00:39:09.040 align:start position:0%
six percent either way
 
00:39:11.750 --> 00:39:11.760 align:start position:0%
on on general and education fund
 
00:39:11.760 --> 00:39:13.109 align:start position:0%
on on general and education fund
revenues

00:39:13.109 --> 00:39:13.119 align:start position:0%
revenues
 
00:39:15.910 --> 00:39:15.920 align:start position:0%
if if they fell below six percent then
 
00:39:17.030 --> 00:39:17.040 align:start position:0%
we would revert
 
00:39:19.349 --> 00:39:19.359 align:start position:0%
back an increment from what had already
 
00:39:21.349 --> 00:39:21.359 align:start position:0%
been happened reduction would have
 
00:39:24.630 --> 00:39:24.640 align:start position:0%
been uh we had to go back a step and
 
00:39:26.150 --> 00:39:26.160 align:start position:0%
uh but the other six percent the other
 
00:39:29.109 --> 00:39:29.119 align:start position:0%
way was we could continue with
 
00:39:32.390 --> 00:39:32.400 align:start position:0%
the tax reductions if uh revenues
 
00:39:32.400 --> 00:39:33.030 align:start position:0%
the tax reductions if uh revenues
exceeded

00:39:33.030 --> 00:39:33.040 align:start position:0%
exceeded
 
00:39:36.630 --> 00:39:36.640 align:start position:0%
that revenue from education and the
 
00:39:36.640 --> 00:39:37.190 align:start position:0%
that revenue from education and the
general

00:39:37.190 --> 00:39:37.200 align:start position:0%
general
 
00:39:40.310 --> 00:39:40.320 align:start position:0%
trust fund money uh and
 
00:39:43.670 --> 00:39:43.680 align:start position:0%
neither those triggers were hit so the
 
00:39:46.790 --> 00:39:46.800 align:start position:0%
the the continuation of the tax
 
00:39:46.800 --> 00:39:47.430 align:start position:0%
the the continuation of the tax
reduction

00:39:47.430 --> 00:39:47.440 align:start position:0%
reduction
 
00:39:50.950 --> 00:39:50.960 align:start position:0%
stopped this bill just moves uh
 
00:39:54.150 --> 00:39:54.160 align:start position:0%
forward again um and
 
00:39:57.589 --> 00:39:57.599 align:start position:0%
as far as the uh pandemic
 
00:40:00.790 --> 00:40:00.800 align:start position:0%
uh it's we won't know until april
 
00:40:03.190 --> 00:40:03.200 align:start position:0%
uh march and april where we really stand
 
00:40:05.030 --> 00:40:05.040 align:start position:0%
with business taxes
 
00:40:07.030 --> 00:40:07.040 align:start position:0%
but all indications are that since we
 
00:40:08.630 --> 00:40:08.640 align:start position:0%
have so many large companies
 
00:40:11.990 --> 00:40:12.000 align:start position:0%
that make up the triangle there uh
 
00:40:13.670 --> 00:40:13.680 align:start position:0%
and they seem to have weathered so far
 
00:40:15.030 --> 00:40:15.040 align:start position:0%
it seems like they're weathering
 
00:40:17.910 --> 00:40:17.920 align:start position:0%
the pandemic quite well i'm a little bit
 
00:40:19.430 --> 00:40:19.440 align:start position:0%
more optimistic about where
 
00:40:22.150 --> 00:40:22.160 align:start position:0%
our business taxes will come in uh at
 
00:40:23.430 --> 00:40:23.440 align:start position:0%
the end of it by the end of this year
 
00:40:25.109 --> 00:40:25.119 align:start position:0%
and going forward
 
00:40:27.030 --> 00:40:27.040 align:start position:0%
those are my comments thank you thank
 
00:40:28.630 --> 00:40:28.640 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
00:40:33.589 --> 00:40:33.599 align:start position:0%
romney representative murphy
 
00:40:37.190 --> 00:40:37.200 align:start position:0%
oh thank you mr chairman um
 
00:40:39.910 --> 00:40:39.920 align:start position:0%
i i think that you know speaking from
 
00:40:41.030 --> 00:40:41.040 align:start position:0%
the medical community
 
00:40:44.230 --> 00:40:44.240 align:start position:0%
covid just like the the great recession
 
00:40:45.829 --> 00:40:45.839 align:start position:0%
has had obviously devastating
 
00:40:48.069 --> 00:40:48.079 align:start position:0%
consequences we've had over we will have
 
00:40:50.150 --> 00:40:50.160 align:start position:0%
over 500 000 dead
 
00:40:52.069 --> 00:40:52.079 align:start position:0%
in the country in the economic downturn
 
00:40:53.910 --> 00:40:53.920 align:start position:0%
has been significant so
 
00:40:55.829 --> 00:40:55.839 align:start position:0%
i know we have been trying to get a hold
 
00:40:55.839 --> 00:40:57.030 align:start position:0%
i know we have been trying to get a hold
of

00:40:57.030 --> 00:40:57.040 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:40:58.870 --> 00:40:58.880 align:start position:0%
authorities so to speak that can speak
 
00:41:01.589 --> 00:41:01.599 align:start position:0%
to the impact of covet going forward
 
00:41:03.190 --> 00:41:03.200 align:start position:0%
we have not been successful so i've
 
00:41:06.230 --> 00:41:06.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:07.990 --> 00:41:08.000 align:start position:0%
infectious disease and epidemiologists
 
00:41:10.470 --> 00:41:10.480 align:start position:0%
that i know well
 
00:41:13.030 --> 00:41:13.040 align:start position:0%
and their opinion about the near-term
 
00:41:14.630 --> 00:41:14.640 align:start position:0%
future especially in the first year of
 
00:41:16.150 --> 00:41:16.160 align:start position:0%
our biennium
 
00:41:18.950 --> 00:41:18.960 align:start position:0%
is that it's not predictable at all
 
00:41:19.670 --> 00:41:19.680 align:start position:0%
they're very
 
00:41:21.349 --> 00:41:21.359 align:start position:0%
positive about the vaccines and its
 
00:41:23.190 --> 00:41:23.200 align:start position:0%
effectiveness they're very positive
 
00:41:25.030 --> 00:41:25.040 align:start position:0%
about the fact that 85 percent of the
 
00:41:26.309 --> 00:41:26.319 align:start position:0%
country is now
 
00:41:28.710 --> 00:41:28.720 align:start position:0%
wearing masks but we know that the
 
00:41:28.720 --> 00:41:29.670 align:start position:0%
wearing masks but we know that the
variance

00:41:29.670 --> 00:41:29.680 align:start position:0%
variance
 
00:41:31.589 --> 00:41:31.599 align:start position:0%
in the vaccine effectiveness against
 
00:41:33.190 --> 00:41:33.200 align:start position:0%
these variants is
 
00:41:36.309 --> 00:41:36.319 align:start position:0%
unpredictable and not as good there was
 
00:41:37.910 --> 00:41:37.920 align:start position:0%
a recent article just yesterday in the
 
00:41:39.910 --> 00:41:39.920 align:start position:0%
valley news up here
 
00:41:43.349 --> 00:41:43.359 align:start position:0%
in the ap speaking to the fact that
 
00:41:45.829 --> 00:41:45.839 align:start position:0%
people that have had previous infections
 
00:41:47.829 --> 00:41:47.839 align:start position:0%
are not really certain to be immune
 
00:41:48.870 --> 00:41:48.880 align:start position:0%
going forward
 
00:41:50.710 --> 00:41:50.720 align:start position:0%
or they may not have the same immunity

as a vaccine provides so
 
00:41:54.790 --> 00:41:54.800 align:start position:0%
in that regard i would like to draw your
 
00:41:56.230 --> 00:41:56.240 align:start position:0%
attention to
 
00:41:58.069 --> 00:41:58.079 align:start position:0%
a article that came out just two days
 
00:42:00.230 --> 00:42:00.240 align:start position:0%
ago from the fiscal policy institute
 
00:42:02.309 --> 00:42:02.319 align:start position:0%
i think we know phil slatten well we
 
00:42:04.710 --> 00:42:04.720 align:start position:0%
know that he is fairly unbiased
 
00:42:06.550 --> 00:42:06.560 align:start position:0%
and it's apropos to our discussions
 
00:42:08.390 --> 00:42:08.400 align:start position:0%
today it's titled actually and i can
 
00:42:10.630 --> 00:42:10.640 align:start position:0%
send it to everybody if they want it

19.

00:42:16.630 --> 00:42:16.640 align:start position:0%
19.
 
00:42:19.349 --> 00:42:19.359 align:start position:0%
how appropriate is that and what their
 
00:42:19.359 --> 00:42:19.910 align:start position:0%
how appropriate is that and what their
research

00:42:19.910 --> 00:42:19.920 align:start position:0%
research
 
00:42:22.950 --> 00:42:22.960 align:start position:0%
shows is that during and after the great
 
00:42:22.960 --> 00:42:23.670 align:start position:0%
shows is that during and after the great
recession

00:42:23.670 --> 00:42:23.680 align:start position:0%
recession
 
00:42:27.109 --> 00:42:27.119 align:start position:0%
moody's analytics in the congressional
 
00:42:28.069 --> 00:42:28.079 align:start position:0%
budget office
 
00:42:31.589 --> 00:42:31.599 align:start position:0%
both looked hard at the
 
00:42:35.190 --> 00:42:35.200 align:start position:0%
economic or the policies that actually
 
00:42:37.510 --> 00:42:37.520 align:start position:0%
stimulate or do not stimulate economic
 
00:42:37.520 --> 00:42:38.390 align:start position:0%
stimulate or do not stimulate economic
growth

00:42:38.390 --> 00:42:38.400 align:start position:0%
growth
 
00:42:41.510 --> 00:42:41.520 align:start position:0%
the research suggested that deploying
 
00:42:41.520 --> 00:42:42.230 align:start position:0%
the research suggested that deploying
research

00:42:42.230 --> 00:42:42.240 align:start position:0%
research
 
00:42:45.589 --> 00:42:45.599 align:start position:0%
resources first to low income into
 
00:42:47.109 --> 00:42:47.119 align:start position:0%
public services
 
00:42:49.349 --> 00:42:49.359 align:start position:0%
goes a lot further in stimulating
 
00:42:51.270 --> 00:42:51.280 align:start position:0%
economic activity so for instance they
 
00:42:53.270 --> 00:42:53.280 align:start position:0%
gave specific numbers
 
00:42:55.670 --> 00:42:55.680 align:start position:0%
for every dollar in expenditures that
 
00:42:58.309 --> 00:42:58.319 align:start position:0%
they looked at after the great recession
 
00:43:01.910 --> 00:43:01.920 align:start position:0%
the snap program supplemental nutrition
 
00:43:04.790 --> 00:43:04.800 align:start position:0%
returned on an investment of 1.75
 
00:43:04.800 --> 00:43:05.430 align:start position:0%
returned on an investment of 1.75
basically

00:43:05.430 --> 00:43:05.440 align:start position:0%
basically
 
00:43:08.630 --> 00:43:08.640 align:start position:0%
uh 75 percent over the dollar invested
 
00:43:12.069 --> 00:43:12.079 align:start position:0%
unemployment insurance benefits
 
00:43:15.270 --> 00:43:15.280 align:start position:0%
about 60. public health infrastructure
 
00:43:18.390 --> 00:43:18.400 align:start position:0%
a buck 60. child tax credits
 
00:43:21.349 --> 00:43:21.359 align:start position:0%
about 40. these are all improvements or
 
00:43:22.390 --> 00:43:22.400 align:start position:0%
these are all
 
00:43:24.790 --> 00:43:24.800 align:start position:0%
measured in economic activity when they
 
00:43:26.710 --> 00:43:26.720 align:start position:0%
looked at corporate and business income
 
00:43:26.720 --> 00:43:27.510 align:start position:0%
looked at corporate and business income
tax

00:43:27.510 --> 00:43:27.520 align:start position:0%
tax
 
00:43:30.470 --> 00:43:30.480 align:start position:0%
reductions the return on one dollar was
 
00:43:30.480 --> 00:43:31.589 align:start position:0%
reductions the return on one dollar was
0.3

00:43:31.589 --> 00:43:31.599 align:start position:0%
0.3
 
00:43:34.309 --> 00:43:34.319 align:start position:0%
30 cents on a dollar that does not seem
 
00:43:34.319 --> 00:43:34.870 align:start position:0%
30 cents on a dollar that does not seem
good

00:43:34.870 --> 00:43:34.880 align:start position:0%
good
 
00:43:36.950 --> 00:43:36.960 align:start position:0%
i would just argue that given the
 
00:43:38.870 --> 00:43:38.880 align:start position:0%
uncertainty going forward especially in
 
00:43:40.390 --> 00:43:40.400 align:start position:0%
the first year of a
 
00:43:42.309 --> 00:43:42.319 align:start position:0%
biennium where we may have some
 
00:43:42.319 --> 00:43:44.950 align:start position:0%
biennium where we may have some
flexibility

00:43:44.950 --> 00:43:44.960 align:start position:0%
flexibility
 
00:43:46.950 --> 00:43:46.960 align:start position:0%
we can debate in the future whether or
 
00:43:49.190 --> 00:43:49.200 align:start position:0%
not you know the merits of decreased
 
00:43:51.030 --> 00:43:51.040 align:start position:0%
taxes are appropriate for corporate and
 
00:43:51.040 --> 00:43:52.230 align:start position:0%
taxes are appropriate for corporate and
businesses

00:43:52.230 --> 00:43:52.240 align:start position:0%
businesses
 
00:43:54.950 --> 00:43:54.960 align:start position:0%
however i think now in the middle of a
 
00:43:54.960 --> 00:43:55.750 align:start position:0%
however i think now in the middle of a
pandemic

00:43:55.750 --> 00:43:55.760 align:start position:0%
pandemic
 
00:43:58.309 --> 00:43:58.319 align:start position:0%
an uncertain future and given the
 
00:43:58.319 --> 00:43:58.950 align:start position:0%
an uncertain future and given the
research

00:43:58.950 --> 00:43:58.960 align:start position:0%
research
 
00:44:00.309 --> 00:44:00.319 align:start position:0%
in the experience from the great
 
00:44:02.950 --> 00:44:02.960 align:start position:0%
recession this is just not the time
 
00:44:04.950 --> 00:44:04.960 align:start position:0%
to be cutting corporate or business
 
00:44:07.510 --> 00:44:07.520 align:start position:0%
taxes and it's supported by research
 
00:44:09.510 --> 00:44:09.520 align:start position:0%
not in new hampshire but by the
 
00:44:11.750 --> 00:44:11.760 align:start position:0%
congressional budget office in moody's
 
00:44:13.270 --> 00:44:13.280 align:start position:0%
analytics so thank you very much for
 
00:44:13.280 --> 00:44:14.630 align:start position:0%
analytics so thank you very much for
listening

00:44:14.630 --> 00:44:14.640 align:start position:0%
listening
 
00:44:17.670 --> 00:44:17.680 align:start position:0%
well thank you representative
 
00:44:20.630 --> 00:44:20.640 align:start position:0%
why don't you go ahead and email that to
 
00:44:20.640 --> 00:44:21.270 align:start position:0%
why don't you go ahead and email that to
us

00:44:21.270 --> 00:44:21.280 align:start position:0%
us
 
00:44:23.670 --> 00:44:23.680 align:start position:0%
i will email you and sue so she can just
 
00:44:24.550 --> 00:44:24.560 align:start position:0%
you guys can
 
00:44:25.910 --> 00:44:25.920 align:start position:0%
send it out on the list service how's
 
00:44:27.910 --> 00:44:27.920 align:start position:0%
that sound okay thank you
 
00:44:34.829 --> 00:44:34.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:34.839 --> 00:44:35.990 align:start position:0%
 
baxter

00:44:35.990 --> 00:44:36.000 align:start position:0%
baxter
 
00:44:39.430 --> 00:44:39.440 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um obviously we are
 
00:44:41.030 --> 00:44:41.040 align:start position:0%
coming out of the pandemic
 
00:44:42.950 --> 00:44:42.960 align:start position:0%
you know a lot of the briefings we're
 
00:44:45.349 --> 00:44:45.359 align:start position:0%
seeing it appears that
 
00:44:47.109 --> 00:44:47.119 align:start position:0%
we might be turning this corner but
 
00:44:48.870 --> 00:44:48.880 align:start position:0%
there's still some uncertainty and i
 
00:44:50.710 --> 00:44:50.720 align:start position:0%
think especially because of that
 
00:44:50.720 --> 00:44:51.829 align:start position:0%
think especially because of that
uncertainty

00:44:51.829 --> 00:44:51.839 align:start position:0%
uncertainty
 
00:44:55.270 --> 00:44:55.280 align:start position:0%
is why we should be prioritizing um
 
00:44:57.670 --> 00:44:57.680 align:start position:0%
these these tax cuts and really it's a
 
00:45:00.630 --> 00:45:00.640 align:start position:0%
return to the already existing schedule
 
00:45:03.910 --> 00:45:03.920 align:start position:0%
so there's nothing that dramatic here
 
00:45:03.920 --> 00:45:04.309 align:start position:0%
so there's nothing that dramatic here
but

00:45:04.309 --> 00:45:04.319 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:45:07.829 --> 00:45:07.839 align:start position:0%
95 or more uh 96
 
00:45:09.510 --> 00:45:09.520 align:start position:0%
by some estimates of the employers in
 
00:45:11.510 --> 00:45:11.520 align:start position:0%
new hampshire are small businesses
 
00:45:13.109 --> 00:45:13.119 align:start position:0%
you know these these mom-and-pop
 
00:45:14.870 --> 00:45:14.880 align:start position:0%
businesses have been decimated during
 
00:45:14.880 --> 00:45:15.589 align:start position:0%
businesses have been decimated during
cobit

00:45:15.589 --> 00:45:15.599 align:start position:0%
cobit
 
00:45:18.550 --> 00:45:18.560 align:start position:0%
and this gradual reduction in the the
 
00:45:21.030 --> 00:45:21.040 align:start position:0%
business uh profit tax and the vet
 
00:45:23.910 --> 00:45:23.920 align:start position:0%
uh are very important to helping small
 
00:45:25.829 --> 00:45:25.839 align:start position:0%
businesses survive and turn the cor
 
00:45:27.510 --> 00:45:27.520 align:start position:0%
to turn the corner a lot of small
 
00:45:29.030 --> 00:45:29.040 align:start position:0%
businesses are struggling they've racked
 
00:45:29.829 --> 00:45:29.839 align:start position:0%
up debt
 
00:45:31.589 --> 00:45:31.599 align:start position:0%
they're on the brink of closing and so
 
00:45:34.309 --> 00:45:34.319 align:start position:0%
these these tax cuts on the margin can
 
00:45:35.349 --> 00:45:35.359 align:start position:0%
help keep
 
00:45:38.069 --> 00:45:38.079 align:start position:0%
our small businesses alive and it's done
 
00:45:39.990 --> 00:45:40.000 align:start position:0%
in a very responsible way
 
00:45:44.390 --> 00:45:44.400 align:start position:0%
um it's gradual and as pat pointed out
 
00:45:46.630 --> 00:45:46.640 align:start position:0%
the trigger still exists so if revenue
 
00:45:47.829 --> 00:45:47.839 align:start position:0%
does drop off
 
00:45:50.550 --> 00:45:50.560 align:start position:0%
um you know things will revert but i
 
00:45:51.829 --> 00:45:51.839 align:start position:0%
strongly support
 
00:45:55.670 --> 00:45:55.680 align:start position:0%
uh these tax cuts thank you mr chair
 
00:46:02.630 --> 00:46:02.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:02.640 --> 00:46:06.710 align:start position:0%
 
uh

00:46:06.710 --> 00:46:06.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:10.069 --> 00:46:10.079 align:start position:0%
we ought to change uh representative
 
00:46:10.079 --> 00:46:12.470 align:start position:0%
we ought to change uh representative
ames

00:46:12.470 --> 00:46:12.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:16.230 --> 00:46:16.240 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
00:46:19.750 --> 00:46:19.760 align:start position:0%
a couple of preliminaries representative
 
00:46:21.430 --> 00:46:21.440 align:start position:0%
baxter just said there
 
00:46:24.470 --> 00:46:24.480 align:start position:0%
the trigger still exists so far as i
 
00:46:26.470 --> 00:46:26.480 align:start position:0%
know it does not
 
00:46:30.950 --> 00:46:30.960 align:start position:0%
i think uh it does not either
 
00:46:34.309 --> 00:46:34.319 align:start position:0%
it's past history right so that needs to
 
00:46:35.349 --> 00:46:35.359 align:start position:0%
be clear
 
00:46:38.230 --> 00:46:38.240 align:start position:0%
and the second preliminary point is that
 
00:46:39.430 --> 00:46:39.440 align:start position:0%
i just sent
 
00:46:44.309 --> 00:46:44.319 align:start position:0%
to all members this early this morning
 
00:46:48.069 --> 00:46:48.079 align:start position:0%
a letter to andrew klein
 
00:46:50.390 --> 00:46:50.400 align:start position:0%
responding to a letter that he sent to
 
00:46:52.230 --> 00:46:52.240 align:start position:0%
all of us
 
00:46:55.190 --> 00:46:55.200 align:start position:0%
in which he referred to an article and
 
00:46:55.200 --> 00:46:56.390 align:start position:0%
in which he referred to an article and
sent

00:46:56.390 --> 00:46:56.400 align:start position:0%
sent
 
00:47:00.150 --> 00:47:00.160 align:start position:0%
well he sent us a link to an article
 
00:47:03.109 --> 00:47:03.119 align:start position:0%
that was published by one of the federal
 
00:47:04.790 --> 00:47:04.800 align:start position:0%
reserve branches
 
00:47:07.670 --> 00:47:07.680 align:start position:0%
and it's a staff working article and the
 
00:47:08.390 --> 00:47:08.400 align:start position:0%
letter that i
 
00:47:13.589 --> 00:47:13.599 align:start position:0%
sent points out that within that article
 
00:47:16.390 --> 00:47:16.400 align:start position:0%
there are caveats that essentially make
 
00:47:18.870 --> 00:47:18.880 align:start position:0%
it inapplicable to
 
00:47:20.870 --> 00:47:20.880 align:start position:0%
the situation we have here in new
 
00:47:20.880 --> 00:47:21.910 align:start position:0%
the situation we have here in new
hampshire

00:47:21.910 --> 00:47:21.920 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
00:47:25.589 --> 00:47:25.599 align:start position:0%
and i also drew attention to
 
00:47:28.630 --> 00:47:28.640 align:start position:0%
another article a more recent article
 
00:47:32.470 --> 00:47:32.480 align:start position:0%
um that comes to quite a different
 
00:47:35.270 --> 00:47:35.280 align:start position:0%
conclusion the the matter addressed in
 
00:47:36.230 --> 00:47:36.240 align:start position:0%
these articles
 
00:47:39.270 --> 00:47:39.280 align:start position:0%
is entrepreneurial activity particularly
 
00:47:39.280 --> 00:47:39.910 align:start position:0%
is entrepreneurial activity particularly
startup

00:47:39.910 --> 00:47:39.920 align:start position:0%
startup
 
00:47:43.030 --> 00:47:43.040 align:start position:0%
activity and the
 
00:47:45.910 --> 00:47:45.920 align:start position:0%
second article says that there's no
 
00:47:47.829 --> 00:47:47.839 align:start position:0%
evidence one way or the other as to the
 
00:47:49.349 --> 00:47:49.359 align:start position:0%
impact of
 
00:47:51.990 --> 00:47:52.000 align:start position:0%
the kinds of stack of tax changes we're
 
00:47:53.349 --> 00:47:53.359 align:start position:0%
talking about it
 
00:47:57.030 --> 00:47:57.040 align:start position:0%
here in the context of of uh
 
00:48:00.390 --> 00:48:00.400 align:start position:0%
house bill 10. so that's preliminary and
 
00:48:00.400 --> 00:48:00.790 align:start position:0%
house bill 10. so that's preliminary and
then

00:48:00.790 --> 00:48:00.800 align:start position:0%
then
 
00:48:04.710 --> 00:48:04.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:07.910 --> 00:48:07.920 align:start position:0%
make a more in-depth
 
00:48:11.349 --> 00:48:11.359 align:start position:0%
statement and point about
 
00:48:13.109 --> 00:48:13.119 align:start position:0%
the assertions responding to the
 
00:48:15.990 --> 00:48:16.000 align:start position:0%
assertions by supporters of this bill
 
00:48:18.950 --> 00:48:18.960 align:start position:0%
that business tax revenues will go up
 
00:48:21.829 --> 00:48:21.839 align:start position:0%
when rates go down
 
00:48:24.150 --> 00:48:24.160 align:start position:0%
i find that these assertions are backed
 
00:48:25.589 --> 00:48:25.599 align:start position:0%
only by
 
00:48:29.109 --> 00:48:29.119 align:start position:0%
anecdote and ideology or sometimes by
 
00:48:29.119 --> 00:48:30.150 align:start position:0%
anecdote and ideology or sometimes by
graphs

00:48:30.150 --> 00:48:30.160 align:start position:0%
graphs
 
00:48:33.109 --> 00:48:33.119 align:start position:0%
that display apparent historical
 
00:48:33.119 --> 00:48:34.470 align:start position:0%
that display apparent historical
correlations

00:48:34.470 --> 00:48:34.480 align:start position:0%
correlations
 
00:48:37.750 --> 00:48:37.760 align:start position:0%
between increased revenues and tax
 
00:48:40.630 --> 00:48:40.640 align:start position:0%
rate reductions particularly pointing to
 
00:48:41.829 --> 00:48:41.839 align:start position:0%
this last
 
00:48:43.910 --> 00:48:43.920 align:start position:0%
decade of experience that we've had here
 
00:48:45.990 --> 00:48:46.000 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire
 
00:48:49.430 --> 00:48:49.440 align:start position:0%
i suggest that these assertions are
 
00:48:51.589 --> 00:48:51.599 align:start position:0%
are not supported by a fact-based
 
00:48:51.599 --> 00:48:53.030 align:start position:0%
are not supported by a fact-based
inquiry

00:48:53.030 --> 00:48:53.040 align:start position:0%
inquiry
 
00:48:55.349 --> 00:48:55.359 align:start position:0%
there are complex and interacting
 
00:48:57.030 --> 00:48:57.040 align:start position:0%
variables that have to be taken into
 
00:48:57.040 --> 00:48:59.030 align:start position:0%
variables that have to be taken into
account

00:48:59.030 --> 00:48:59.040 align:start position:0%
account
 
00:49:00.950 --> 00:49:00.960 align:start position:0%
some of those developments that have
 
00:49:03.270 --> 00:49:03.280 align:start position:0%
increased new hampshire revenue
 
00:49:06.309 --> 00:49:06.319 align:start position:0%
through this past decade despite
 
00:49:09.990 --> 00:49:10.000 align:start position:0%
the bbt and bet tax rate cuts
 
00:49:12.630 --> 00:49:12.640 align:start position:0%
have included and here i'm going to go
 
00:49:14.630 --> 00:49:14.640 align:start position:0%
into a short list
 
00:49:17.430 --> 00:49:17.440 align:start position:0%

this
 
00:49:20.309 --> 00:49:20.319 align:start position:0%
at least those of us who've been with
 
00:49:22.470 --> 00:49:22.480 align:start position:0%
ways and means for a while
 
00:49:25.910 --> 00:49:25.920 align:start position:0%

assure you

we all know that future revenues

business tax cuts
 
00:52:18.790 --> 00:52:18.800 align:start position:0%

aside
 
00:52:26.230 --> 00:52:26.240 align:start position:0%
all the variables that i've just talked
 
00:52:28.230 --> 00:52:28.240 align:start position:0%
about it's just
 
00:52:31.430 --> 00:52:31.440 align:start position:0%
a mathematical calculation
 
00:52:34.710 --> 00:52:34.720 align:start position:0%
i believe that is the best estimate
 
00:52:38.630 --> 00:52:38.640 align:start position:0%
of impact that we have for this bill
 
00:52:41.109 --> 00:52:41.119 align:start position:0%
and i also believe that we cannot accept
 
00:52:43.270 --> 00:52:43.280 align:start position:0%
the level of revenue loss
 
00:52:46.309 --> 00:52:46.319 align:start position:0%
that enactment of hb 10 will expose us
 
00:52:46.319 --> 00:52:47.829 align:start position:0%
that enactment of hb 10 will expose us
to

00:52:47.829 --> 00:52:47.839 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:52:51.589 --> 00:52:51.599 align:start position:0%
this bill is fiscally irresponsible
 
00:52:55.910 --> 00:52:55.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:59.109 --> 00:52:59.119 align:start position:0%
thank you representative ames
 
00:53:04.870 --> 00:53:04.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:08.069 --> 00:53:08.079 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman uh
 
00:53:10.710 --> 00:53:10.720 align:start position:0%
uh representative uh almay and others
 
00:53:12.829 --> 00:53:12.839 align:start position:0%
have uh
 
00:53:16.150 --> 00:53:16.160 align:start position:0%
already uh talked about
 
00:53:19.430 --> 00:53:19.440 align:start position:0%
uh what businesses
 
00:53:22.630 --> 00:53:22.640 align:start position:0%
pay in terms of taxes and may not have a
 
00:53:26.549 --> 00:53:26.559 align:start position:0%
uh itemized idea
 
00:53:30.150 --> 00:53:30.160 align:start position:0%
of their property taxes business profits
 
00:53:30.160 --> 00:53:31.109 align:start position:0%
of their property taxes business profits
taxes

00:53:31.109 --> 00:53:31.119 align:start position:0%
taxes
 
00:53:33.430 --> 00:53:33.440 align:start position:0%
but they that we we're pretty sure they
 
00:53:35.109 --> 00:53:35.119 align:start position:0%
pay more in uh
 
00:53:39.109 --> 00:53:39.119 align:start position:0%
property taxes in this state than um
 
00:53:40.790 --> 00:53:40.800 align:start position:0%
they do business taxes and they've
 
00:53:43.190 --> 00:53:43.200 align:start position:0%
talked about that in surveys among
 
00:53:46.390 --> 00:53:46.400 align:start position:0%
bia members and others they
 
00:53:50.549 --> 00:53:50.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:52.470 --> 00:53:52.480 align:start position:0%
property taxes as being much more
 
00:53:55.510 --> 00:53:55.520 align:start position:0%
onerous and difficult to deal with than
 
00:54:00.230 --> 00:54:00.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:03.349 --> 00:54:03.359 align:start position:0%
and with with this and these these
 
00:54:04.470 --> 00:54:04.480 align:start position:0%
property taxes
 
00:54:07.190 --> 00:54:07.200 align:start position:0%
go up every year and a lot of that is
 
00:54:08.150 --> 00:54:08.160 align:start position:0%
due to the
 
00:54:10.390 --> 00:54:10.400 align:start position:0%
withdrawal of reduction of state aid for
 
00:54:11.750 --> 00:54:11.760 align:start position:0%
direct municipal and
 
00:54:14.630 --> 00:54:14.640 align:start position:0%
county subsidies and for provision of
 
00:54:17.109 --> 00:54:17.119 align:start position:0%
services such as police training
 
00:54:20.230 --> 00:54:20.240 align:start position:0%
elder and assistance in public health
 
00:54:24.470 --> 00:54:24.480 align:start position:0%
and of fixed public school system costs
 
00:54:28.069 --> 00:54:28.079 align:start position:0%
i uh was a selectman in
 
00:54:31.270 --> 00:54:31.280 align:start position:0%
a town right after the great recession
 
00:54:31.910 --> 00:54:31.920 align:start position:0%
or during
 
00:54:36.309 --> 00:54:36.319 align:start position:0%
right after it and um we saw
 
00:54:39.270 --> 00:54:39.280 align:start position:0%
firsthand what um a loss of state
 
00:54:39.280 --> 00:54:39.990 align:start position:0%
firsthand what um a loss of state
revenue

00:54:39.990 --> 00:54:40.000 align:start position:0%
revenue
 
00:54:43.430 --> 00:54:43.440 align:start position:0%
did uh and uh
 
00:54:47.430 --> 00:54:47.440 align:start position:0%
uh the to the to the towns
 
00:54:51.030 --> 00:54:51.040 align:start position:0%
uh and we had to scramble
 
00:54:54.069 --> 00:54:54.079 align:start position:0%
to make
 
00:54:57.109 --> 00:54:57.119 align:start position:0%
new budgets for this town
 
00:54:59.750 --> 00:54:59.760 align:start position:0%
and had to raise the property taxes it
 
00:54:59.760 --> 00:55:00.309 align:start position:0%
and had to raise the property taxes it
was

00:55:00.309 --> 00:55:00.319 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:55:03.270 --> 00:55:03.280 align:start position:0%
because we were forced to take up
 
00:55:03.280 --> 00:55:04.630 align:start position:0%
because we were forced to take up
expenses

00:55:04.630 --> 00:55:04.640 align:start position:0%
expenses
 
00:55:07.829 --> 00:55:07.839 align:start position:0%
that state had normally carried my
 
00:55:12.710 --> 00:55:12.720 align:start position:0%
most most notably the uh
 
00:55:15.589 --> 00:55:15.599 align:start position:0%
support of um retirement for public
 
00:55:17.270 --> 00:55:17.280 align:start position:0%
officials police fire
 
00:55:20.470 --> 00:55:20.480 align:start position:0%
and all that uh residents just couldn't
 
00:55:22.470 --> 00:55:22.480 align:start position:0%
understand why if there were tax cuts
 
00:55:23.829 --> 00:55:23.839 align:start position:0%
and budget cut
 
00:55:25.750 --> 00:55:25.760 align:start position:0%
why the state was spending less money
 
00:55:27.910 --> 00:55:27.920 align:start position:0%
why their property taxes went up
 
00:55:30.230 --> 00:55:30.240 align:start position:0%
and uh selectmen in towns all across the
 
00:55:31.670 --> 00:55:31.680 align:start position:0%
state were caught in a bind
 
00:55:35.430 --> 00:55:35.440 align:start position:0%
to try to explain that and it was tough
 
00:55:38.870 --> 00:55:38.880 align:start position:0%
and uh i just in my opinion
 
00:55:41.109 --> 00:55:41.119 align:start position:0%
having been in the trenches like that i
 
00:55:42.309 --> 00:55:42.319 align:start position:0%
think we're
 
00:55:46.549 --> 00:55:46.559 align:start position:0%
causing we could be causing our towns
 
00:55:49.190 --> 00:55:49.200 align:start position:0%
to look at this again force increases in
 
00:55:51.190 --> 00:55:51.200 align:start position:0%
property taxes because of the
 
00:55:54.390 --> 00:55:54.400 align:start position:0%
the word downshifting and i think that
 
00:55:55.670 --> 00:55:55.680 align:start position:0%
creates a burden
 
00:55:59.430 --> 00:55:59.440 align:start position:0%
on property taxpayers and that's
 
00:56:01.670 --> 00:56:01.680 align:start position:0%
clearly my position on this because i've
 
00:56:02.870 --> 00:56:02.880 align:start position:0%
experienced it
 
00:56:06.069 --> 00:56:06.079 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you hello
 
00:56:12.230 --> 00:56:12.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:13.829 --> 00:56:13.839 align:start position:0%
thank you excuse the printer in the
 
00:56:13.839 --> 00:56:15.430 align:start position:0%
thank you excuse the printer in the
background

00:56:15.430 --> 00:56:15.440 align:start position:0%
background
 
00:56:19.030 --> 00:56:19.040 align:start position:0%
i'm just looking up a few things
 
00:56:20.870 --> 00:56:20.880 align:start position:0%
the discussion thus far has been about a
 
00:56:22.549 --> 00:56:22.559 align:start position:0%
reduction in revenue
 
00:56:25.349 --> 00:56:25.359 align:start position:0%
and yet when these tax cuts uh business
 
00:56:26.230 --> 00:56:26.240 align:start position:0%
tax cuts were
 
00:56:28.950 --> 00:56:28.960 align:start position:0%
instituted there was a substantial
 
00:56:28.960 --> 00:56:30.069 align:start position:0%
instituted there was a substantial
increase

00:56:30.069 --> 00:56:30.079 align:start position:0%
increase
 
00:56:32.549 --> 00:56:32.559 align:start position:0%
in revenue across the nation there has
 
00:56:33.270 --> 00:56:33.280 align:start position:0%
been an
 
00:56:36.950 --> 00:56:36.960 align:start position:0%
in increase in revenue when tax cuts
 
00:56:37.750 --> 00:56:37.760 align:start position:0%
have been
 
00:56:40.870 --> 00:56:40.880 align:start position:0%
implemented a recent cnbc
 
00:56:44.390 --> 00:56:44.400 align:start position:0%
article she published
 
00:56:48.549 --> 00:56:48.559 align:start position:0%
geez february 8th of 2021
 
00:56:51.990 --> 00:56:52.000 align:start position:0%
indicates that there is a flow of jobs
 
00:56:55.750 --> 00:56:55.760 align:start position:0%
and cash and business opportunity
 
00:56:58.789 --> 00:56:58.799 align:start position:0%
from the high tax northeast to the low
 
00:56:58.799 --> 00:56:59.589 align:start position:0%
from the high tax northeast to the low
tax

00:56:59.589 --> 00:56:59.599 align:start position:0%
tax
 
00:57:02.549 --> 00:57:02.559 align:start position:0%
south so how do we stem that flow we
 
00:57:03.910 --> 00:57:03.920 align:start position:0%
keep talking about
 
00:57:06.630 --> 00:57:06.640 align:start position:0%
stimming the flow of the loss of
 
00:57:08.549 --> 00:57:08.559 align:start position:0%
students from the area that
 
00:57:11.510 --> 00:57:11.520 align:start position:0%
get a good education at unh or dartmouth
 
00:57:12.950 --> 00:57:12.960 align:start position:0%
and then leave
 
00:57:15.910 --> 00:57:15.920 align:start position:0%
we we talk about stemming the flow of
 
00:57:15.920 --> 00:57:17.270 align:start position:0%
we we talk about stemming the flow of
population

00:57:17.270 --> 00:57:17.280 align:start position:0%
population
 
00:57:21.190 --> 00:57:21.200 align:start position:0%
to the south well there's one way to do
 
00:57:21.200 --> 00:57:21.750 align:start position:0%
to the south well there's one way to do
that

00:57:21.750 --> 00:57:21.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:57:24.230 --> 00:57:24.240 align:start position:0%
let's make it more economically
 
00:57:24.240 --> 00:57:25.670 align:start position:0%
let's make it more economically
advantageous

00:57:25.670 --> 00:57:25.680 align:start position:0%
advantageous
 
00:57:30.390 --> 00:57:30.400 align:start position:0%
for people to stay in the northeast
 
00:57:34.230 --> 00:57:34.240 align:start position:0%
just today west virginia has
 
00:57:36.870 --> 00:57:36.880 align:start position:0%
introduced legislation to lower their
 
00:57:38.390 --> 00:57:38.400 align:start position:0%
business taxes and they say west
 
00:57:39.750 --> 00:57:39.760 align:start position:0%
virginia because
 
00:57:41.750 --> 00:57:41.760 align:start position:0%
like new hampshire there are mountains
 
00:57:42.950 --> 00:57:42.960 align:start position:0%
like new hampshire
 
00:57:46.710 --> 00:57:46.720 align:start position:0%
they have a population that
 
00:57:49.910 --> 00:57:49.920 align:start position:0%
has suffered for too long under a two
 
00:57:53.829 --> 00:57:53.839 align:start position:0%
heavy attacks burden there was also an
 
00:57:56.150 --> 00:57:56.160 align:start position:0%
argument that this shifts taxes down to
 
00:57:57.349 --> 00:57:57.359 align:start position:0%
the towns
 
00:57:59.990 --> 00:58:00.000 align:start position:0%
well who's responsible for what a town
 
00:58:00.000 --> 00:58:01.589 align:start position:0%
well who's responsible for what a town
spends

00:58:01.589 --> 00:58:01.599 align:start position:0%
spends
 
00:58:05.030 --> 00:58:05.040 align:start position:0%
the town is responsible the citizens
 
00:58:07.750 --> 00:58:07.760 align:start position:0%
are responsible if they want to build a
 
00:58:09.829 --> 00:58:09.839 align:start position:0%
brand spanking new high school every
 
00:58:11.190 --> 00:58:11.200 align:start position:0%
three years
 
00:58:13.829 --> 00:58:13.839 align:start position:0%
that's up to the town it's not up to the
 
00:58:13.839 --> 00:58:14.470 align:start position:0%
that's up to the town it's not up to the
state

00:58:14.470 --> 00:58:14.480 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:58:16.710 --> 00:58:16.720 align:start position:0%
to cover their other expenses so they
 
00:58:17.910 --> 00:58:17.920 align:start position:0%
can afford that
 
00:58:21.190 --> 00:58:21.200 align:start position:0%
they need to do that they need to
 
00:58:24.789 --> 00:58:24.799 align:start position:0%
address their own expenses
 
00:58:27.750 --> 00:58:27.760 align:start position:0%
tax cuts have a multiplier effect upon
 
00:58:29.589 --> 00:58:29.599 align:start position:0%
the economy they always have and they
 
00:58:30.789 --> 00:58:30.799 align:start position:0%
always will be
 
00:58:33.349 --> 00:58:33.359 align:start position:0%
whether it's the kennedy johnson uh tax
 
00:58:33.359 --> 00:58:34.390 align:start position:0%
whether it's the kennedy johnson uh tax
reductions

00:58:34.390 --> 00:58:34.400 align:start position:0%
reductions
 
00:58:37.510 --> 00:58:37.520 align:start position:0%
or the reagan tax reductions or the the
 
00:58:38.549 --> 00:58:38.559 align:start position:0%
bush trump
 
00:58:41.750 --> 00:58:41.760 align:start position:0%
uh tax uh income tax cuts
 
00:58:43.510 --> 00:58:43.520 align:start position:0%
they have a multiplier effect they
 
00:58:45.910 --> 00:58:45.920 align:start position:0%
stimulate the economy that make sure
 
00:58:49.349 --> 00:58:49.359 align:start position:0%
that the working man has
 
00:58:52.710 --> 00:58:52.720 align:start position:0%
money in his pocket because he has a job
 
00:58:55.190 --> 00:58:55.200 align:start position:0%
and he's getting paid
 
00:58:59.670 --> 00:58:59.680 align:start position:0%
so i have to
 
00:59:02.829 --> 00:59:02.839 align:start position:0%
thank that uh for that uh interruption
 
00:59:05.510 --> 00:59:05.520 align:start position:0%
sorry but the uh
 
00:59:08.950 --> 00:59:08.960 align:start position:0%
tax cuts work they always have worked
 
00:59:12.069 --> 00:59:12.079 align:start position:0%
they always will work so i'm in favor of
 
00:59:13.670 --> 00:59:13.680 align:start position:0%
passing this
 
00:59:15.750 --> 00:59:15.760 align:start position:0%
and it would make that motion right now
 
00:59:18.920 --> 00:59:18.930 align:start position:0%
if allowed
 
00:59:18.930 --> 00:59:22.470 align:start position:0%
if allowed

economic recovery if tax rate reductions

are implemented the source i believe

applied to house bill

01:05:22.870 --> 01:05:22.880 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:05:25.349 --> 01:05:25.359 align:start position:0%
as a business owner i do understand the
 
01:05:28.470 --> 01:05:28.480 align:start position:0%
desire to have lower business taxes
 
01:05:31.430 --> 01:05:31.440 align:start position:0%
but our business pays about eight times
 
01:05:33.190 --> 01:05:33.200 align:start position:0%
actually a little bit more
 
01:05:35.349 --> 01:05:35.359 align:start position:0%
in property taxes than we do in business
 
01:05:35.359 --> 01:05:37.109 align:start position:0%
in property taxes than we do in business
taxes

01:05:37.109 --> 01:05:37.119 align:start position:0%
taxes
 
01:05:39.829 --> 01:05:39.839 align:start position:0%
so if reducing these tax rates increases
 
01:05:43.190 --> 01:05:43.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:45.670 --> 01:05:45.680 align:start position:0%
and the taxes of the members of my town
 
01:05:47.829 --> 01:05:47.839 align:start position:0%
especially the elderly i think we need
 
01:05:49.750 --> 01:05:49.760 align:start position:0%
to think twice
 
01:05:52.309 --> 01:05:52.319 align:start position:0%
56 percent of new hampshire households
 
01:05:54.710 --> 01:05:54.720 align:start position:0%

01:05:55.829 --> 01:05:55.839 align:start position:0%
expenses
 
01:05:58.950 --> 01:05:58.960 align:start position:0%
in the past seven days this was in a
 
01:06:00.870 --> 01:06:00.880 align:start position:0%
recent survey done last month by the
 
01:06:04.069 --> 01:06:04.079 align:start position:0%
fiscal policy institute
 
01:06:05.910 --> 01:06:05.920 align:start position:0%
we can't cut the revenue stream that
 
01:06:09.029 --> 01:06:09.039 align:start position:0%
helps our citizens in times of trouble
 
01:06:11.190 --> 01:06:11.200 align:start position:0%
keeping dollars in the hands of people
 
01:06:12.069 --> 01:06:12.079 align:start position:0%
is the biggest
 
01:06:15.109 --> 01:06:15.119 align:start position:0%
economic multiplier cutting business
 
01:06:17.589 --> 01:06:17.599 align:start position:0%
taxes is one of the lowest
 
01:06:19.990 --> 01:06:20.000 align:start position:0%
i truly think this is a dangerous avenue
 
01:06:20.789 --> 01:06:20.799 align:start position:0%
to go down
 
01:06:24.230 --> 01:06:24.240 align:start position:0%
in these uncertain times uncertain times
 
01:06:26.390 --> 01:06:26.400 align:start position:0%
not only in regard to the pandemic
 
01:06:29.349 --> 01:06:29.359 align:start position:0%
economic impact but i also worry about
 
01:06:31.589 --> 01:06:31.599 align:start position:0%
other legislation that may compound the
 
01:06:31.599 --> 01:06:32.390 align:start position:0%
other legislation that may compound the
effect

01:06:32.390 --> 01:06:32.400 align:start position:0%
effect
 
01:06:36.470 --> 01:06:36.480 align:start position:0%
of these reductions in revenue
 
01:06:38.950 --> 01:06:38.960 align:start position:0%
and i also think we do have the lowest
 
01:06:40.950 --> 01:06:40.960 align:start position:0%
business tax in new england is that not
 
01:06:40.960 --> 01:06:43.670 align:start position:0%
business tax in new england is that not
correct

01:06:43.670 --> 01:06:43.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:47.349 --> 01:06:47.359 align:start position:0%
anyways um i think we need to be in this
 
01:06:47.359 --> 01:06:48.069 align:start position:0%
anyways um i think we need to be in this
together

01:06:48.069 --> 01:06:48.079 align:start position:0%
together
 
01:06:51.270 --> 01:06:51.280 align:start position:0%
and and try to take care of our populace
 
01:06:51.280 --> 01:06:51.750 align:start position:0%
and and try to take care of our populace
now

01:06:51.750 --> 01:06:51.760 align:start position:0%
now
 
01:06:53.670 --> 01:06:53.680 align:start position:0%
instead of trying to tempt business into
 
01:06:54.870 --> 01:06:54.880 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
01:06:57.589 --> 01:06:57.599 align:start position:0%
with reducing our business taxes further
 
01:06:59.430 --> 01:06:59.440 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:07:01.430 --> 01:07:01.440 align:start position:0%
thank you representative and
 
01:07:06.950 --> 01:07:06.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:10.309 --> 01:07:10.319 align:start position:0%
fair i just wanted to respond um
 
01:07:12.470 --> 01:07:12.480 align:start position:0%
to a couple of the arguments that have
 
01:07:14.870 --> 01:07:14.880 align:start position:0%
been presented this morning
 
01:07:18.309 --> 01:07:18.319 align:start position:0%
first from representative ulri his
 
01:07:21.990 --> 01:07:22.000 align:start position:0%
example of bringing up west virginia's
 
01:07:25.190 --> 01:07:25.200 align:start position:0%
business tax cuts he made the claim that
 
01:07:27.510 --> 01:07:27.520 align:start position:0%
you know the result of those business
 
01:07:29.829 --> 01:07:29.839 align:start position:0%
tax cuts was a revenue boom for the
 
01:07:29.839 --> 01:07:31.670 align:start position:0%
tax cuts was a revenue boom for the
state

01:07:31.670 --> 01:07:31.680 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:07:33.750 --> 01:07:33.760 align:start position:0%
i think we just need to take a step back
 
01:07:35.910 --> 01:07:35.920 align:start position:0%
and recognize that west virginia's
 
01:07:37.829 --> 01:07:37.839 align:start position:0%
variables for their economy were
 
01:07:39.829 --> 01:07:39.839 align:start position:0%
numerous and
 
01:07:41.990 --> 01:07:42.000 align:start position:0%
that you know the cut of the business
 
01:07:44.710 --> 01:07:44.720 align:start position:0%
tax may not have directly correlated to
 
01:07:45.829 --> 01:07:45.839 align:start position:0%
the revenue increase
 
01:07:47.670 --> 01:07:47.680 align:start position:0%
and i think specifically it's worthy to
 
01:07:48.870 --> 01:07:48.880 align:start position:0%
point out that
 
01:07:51.910 --> 01:07:51.920 align:start position:0%
west virginia does have an income tax
 
01:07:54.150 --> 01:07:54.160 align:start position:0%
so while that state's example is
 
01:07:54.160 --> 01:07:55.349 align:start position:0%
so while that state's example is
relevant

01:07:55.349 --> 01:07:55.359 align:start position:0%
relevant
 
01:07:58.150 --> 01:07:58.160 align:start position:0%
um to his argument i think we have a
 
01:07:59.510 --> 01:07:59.520 align:start position:0%
more compelling case
 
01:08:01.990 --> 01:08:02.000 align:start position:0%
to look at and that specifically relates
 
01:08:03.190 --> 01:08:03.200 align:start position:0%
to the
 
01:08:05.510 --> 01:08:05.520 align:start position:0%
state of kansas i'm not sure if everyone
 
01:08:07.349 --> 01:08:07.359 align:start position:0%
on our committee is familiar
 
01:08:12.069 --> 01:08:12.079 align:start position:0%
with that a recent um 2013-2017
 
01:08:12.079 --> 01:08:13.430 align:start position:0%
with that a recent um 2013-2017
experiment

01:08:13.430 --> 01:08:13.440 align:start position:0%
experiment
 
01:08:15.270 --> 01:08:15.280 align:start position:0%
by the state legislature and the
 
01:08:16.630 --> 01:08:16.640 align:start position:0%
governor there
 
01:08:19.030 --> 01:08:19.040 align:start position:0%
so as a brief brief rundown i'd just
 
01:08:20.789 --> 01:08:20.799 align:start position:0%
like to remind everyone
 
01:08:24.229 --> 01:08:24.239 align:start position:0%
that in 2013 governor
 
01:08:28.070 --> 01:08:28.080 align:start position:0%
sam brownback initiated a series of
 
01:08:32.229 --> 01:08:32.239 align:start position:0%
um i guess it was structured tax cuts
 
01:08:34.149 --> 01:08:34.159 align:start position:0%
for business taxes as well as a
 
01:08:35.510 --> 01:08:35.520 align:start position:0%
reduction in the state's
 
01:08:39.030 --> 01:08:39.040 align:start position:0%
income tax to levels that were much much
 
01:08:41.349 --> 01:08:41.359 align:start position:0%
lower than the previous experiment
 
01:08:44.470 --> 01:08:44.480 align:start position:0%
uh experience and um over
 
01:08:47.349 --> 01:08:47.359 align:start position:0%
a series of three to four years um it
 
01:08:48.149 --> 01:08:48.159 align:start position:0%
was his
 
01:08:51.430 --> 01:08:51.440 align:start position:0%
experiment or his hypothesis that
 
01:08:54.229 --> 01:08:54.239 align:start position:0%
you know these results from those tax
 
01:08:55.189 --> 01:08:55.199 align:start position:0%
cuts would
 
01:08:58.870 --> 01:08:58.880 align:start position:0%
bring um
 
01:09:01.749 --> 01:09:01.759 align:start position:0%
i guess like higher turnout higher
 
01:09:03.590 --> 01:09:03.600 align:start position:0%
increases of job availability
 
01:09:05.349 --> 01:09:05.359 align:start position:0%
as well as you know boosting this
 
01:09:06.630 --> 01:09:06.640 align:start position:0%
economic growth
 
01:09:09.669 --> 01:09:09.679 align:start position:0%
and making the overall constituents of
 
01:09:10.789 --> 01:09:10.799 align:start position:0%
kansas richer
 
01:09:13.829 --> 01:09:13.839 align:start position:0%
because of those cuts and you know
 
01:09:18.829 --> 01:09:18.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:20.950 --> 01:09:20.960 align:start position:0%
was just
 
01:09:23.349 --> 01:09:23.359 align:start position:0%
sheer economic destruction in the state
 
01:09:25.269 --> 01:09:25.279 align:start position:0%
with a very difficult time of supporting
 
01:09:26.470 --> 01:09:26.480 align:start position:0%
their systems
 
01:09:29.829 --> 01:09:29.839 align:start position:0%
and programs across the board and their
 
01:09:29.839 --> 01:09:30.550 align:start position:0%
and programs across the board and their
budgets

01:09:30.550 --> 01:09:30.560 align:start position:0%
budgets
 
01:09:33.910 --> 01:09:33.920 align:start position:0%
basically imploded and i think you know
 
01:09:35.430 --> 01:09:35.440 align:start position:0%
you don't have to take my word for it
 
01:09:37.430 --> 01:09:37.440 align:start position:0%
there are several
 
01:09:40.390 --> 01:09:40.400 align:start position:0%
worthy journalistic news articles about
 
01:09:40.400 --> 01:09:40.870 align:start position:0%
worthy journalistic news articles about
this

01:09:40.870 --> 01:09:40.880 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:09:43.990 --> 01:09:44.000 align:start position:0%
you know series of four years uh oh four
 
01:09:44.950 --> 01:09:44.960 align:start position:0%
and a half years
 
01:09:48.309 --> 01:09:48.319 align:start position:0%
of this implosion and you know
 
01:09:50.390 --> 01:09:50.400 align:start position:0%
the idea that trickle-down economics is
 
01:09:52.070 --> 01:09:52.080 align:start position:0%
going to work on a state basis by
 
01:09:52.080 --> 01:09:53.110 align:start position:0%
going to work on a state basis by
reducing

01:09:53.110 --> 01:09:53.120 align:start position:0%
reducing
 
01:09:55.590 --> 01:09:55.600 align:start position:0%
business taxes has been proven to have
 
01:09:55.600 --> 01:09:56.149 align:start position:0%
business taxes has been proven to have
failed

01:09:56.149 --> 01:09:56.159 align:start position:0%
failed
 
01:09:59.350 --> 01:09:59.360 align:start position:0%
it's the kansas experiment
 
01:10:01.669 --> 01:10:01.679 align:start position:0%
is not something we need to repeat here
 
01:10:02.950 --> 01:10:02.960 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire
 
01:10:05.270 --> 01:10:05.280 align:start position:0%
and we can do better we can learn from
 
01:10:06.630 --> 01:10:06.640 align:start position:0%
their mistakes
 
01:10:09.030 --> 01:10:09.040 align:start position:0%
and we can you know give our state the
 
01:10:09.040 --> 01:10:10.390 align:start position:0%
and we can you know give our state the
ability

01:10:10.390 --> 01:10:10.400 align:start position:0%
ability
 
01:10:13.830 --> 01:10:13.840 align:start position:0%
um to boost our revenues or at least
 
01:10:15.750 --> 01:10:15.760 align:start position:0%
keep them stable during a serious
 
01:10:15.760 --> 01:10:17.030 align:start position:0%
keep them stable during a serious
pandemic

01:10:17.030 --> 01:10:17.040 align:start position:0%
pandemic
 
01:10:20.070 --> 01:10:20.080 align:start position:0%
as opposed to trying to recreate
 
01:10:22.229 --> 01:10:22.239 align:start position:0%
the same failed experiment in new
 
01:10:24.950 --> 01:10:24.960 align:start position:0%
hampshire we we don't need to do kansas
 
01:10:28.070 --> 01:10:28.080 align:start position:0%
bidding here so let's let's use our
 
01:10:29.030 --> 01:10:29.040 align:start position:0%
brains let's
 
01:10:30.870 --> 01:10:30.880 align:start position:0%
see the experience that other states
 
01:10:33.110 --> 01:10:33.120 align:start position:0%
have had and know that it was an abject
 
01:10:33.120 --> 01:10:33.669 align:start position:0%
have had and know that it was an abject
failure

01:10:33.669 --> 01:10:33.679 align:start position:0%
failure
 
01:10:36.310 --> 01:10:36.320 align:start position:0%
and not be doomed to repeat that history
 
01:10:36.320 --> 01:10:37.270 align:start position:0%
and not be doomed to repeat that history
here

01:10:37.270 --> 01:10:37.280 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:10:39.910 --> 01:10:39.920 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you
 
01:10:39.920 --> 01:10:41.189 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you
representative

01:10:41.189 --> 01:10:41.199 align:start position:0%

01:10:43.910 --> 01:10:43.920 align:start position:0%
hacken phillips mr chairman may i
 
01:10:43.920 --> 01:10:44.550 align:start position:0%
hacken phillips mr chairman may i
speaking

01:10:44.550 --> 01:10:44.560 align:start position:0%
speaking
 
01:10:47.990 --> 01:10:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:51.270 --> 01:10:51.280 align:start position:0%
yes um
 
01:10:53.350 --> 01:10:53.360 align:start position:0%
representative hackenfeld's uh
 
01:10:54.790 --> 01:10:54.800 align:start position:0%
characterization of the
 
01:10:58.149 --> 01:10:58.159 align:start position:0%
kansas uh experiment uh was
 
01:11:01.669 --> 01:11:01.679 align:start position:0%
rather partisan and uh not entirely
 
01:11:01.679 --> 01:11:02.390 align:start position:0%
rather partisan and uh not entirely
accurate

01:11:02.390 --> 01:11:02.400 align:start position:0%
accurate
 
01:11:05.510 --> 01:11:05.520 align:start position:0%
according to recent activities uh if you
 
01:11:07.590 --> 01:11:07.600 align:start position:0%
take a look at your news feeds uh
 
01:11:10.550 --> 01:11:10.560 align:start position:0%
you'll see that kansas just uh rejected
 
01:11:10.560 --> 01:11:10.790 align:start position:0%
you'll see that kansas just uh rejected
an

01:11:10.790 --> 01:11:10.800 align:start position:0%
an
 
01:11:13.750 --> 01:11:13.760 align:start position:0%
increase in taxation you'll also notice
 
01:11:14.709 --> 01:11:14.719 align:start position:0%
if you look at
 
01:11:17.750 --> 01:11:17.760 align:start position:0%
several of the different uh ranking
 
01:11:19.590 --> 01:11:19.600 align:start position:0%
systems that exist throughout the state
 
01:11:20.709 --> 01:11:20.719 align:start position:0%
that kansas
 
01:11:23.030 --> 01:11:23.040 align:start position:0%
ranks relatively high and higher than
 
01:11:23.910 --> 01:11:23.920 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
01:11:26.630 --> 01:11:26.640 align:start position:0%
that new hampshire does in the tax
 
01:11:29.030 --> 01:11:29.040 align:start position:0%
burden on the taxpayers
 
01:11:33.750 --> 01:11:33.760 align:start position:0%
and their economic prosperity
 
01:11:37.430 --> 01:11:37.440 align:start position:0%
the to me biased information from the
 
01:11:39.669 --> 01:11:39.679 align:start position:0%
new hampshire physical institute
 
01:11:42.390 --> 01:11:42.400 align:start position:0%
having attended several of their uh
 
01:11:42.400 --> 01:11:43.030 align:start position:0%
having attended several of their uh
lectures

01:11:43.030 --> 01:11:43.040 align:start position:0%
lectures
 
01:11:45.350 --> 01:11:45.360 align:start position:0%
it was purely anti-republican and
 
01:11:45.360 --> 01:11:46.310 align:start position:0%
it was purely anti-republican and
partisan

01:11:46.310 --> 01:11:46.320 align:start position:0%
partisan
 
01:11:49.350 --> 01:11:49.360 align:start position:0%
uh i i disregard totally anything that
 
01:11:50.709 --> 01:11:50.719 align:start position:0%
they have to say
 
01:11:54.229 --> 01:11:54.239 align:start position:0%
uh because of their
 
01:11:57.590 --> 01:11:57.600 align:start position:0%
presentations that i've attended uh
 
01:12:02.390 --> 01:12:02.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:05.430 --> 01:12:05.440 align:start position:0%
at any rate the point that i wish to
 
01:12:06.070 --> 01:12:06.080 align:start position:0%
make is
 
01:12:09.590 --> 01:12:09.600 align:start position:0%
is that tax cuts work
 
01:12:12.790 --> 01:12:12.800 align:start position:0%
they have worked they have always worked
 
01:12:15.030 --> 01:12:15.040 align:start position:0%
they've worked on a national level they
 
01:12:17.669 --> 01:12:17.679 align:start position:0%
can work they work on a state level
 
01:12:20.310 --> 01:12:20.320 align:start position:0%
and kansas is a hell of a lot better off
 
01:12:22.149 --> 01:12:22.159 align:start position:0%
than new hampshire is as far as a
 
01:12:24.390 --> 01:12:24.400 align:start position:0%
tax burden is concerned thank you mr
 
01:12:26.709 --> 01:12:26.719 align:start position:0%
chair for the opportunity today
 
01:12:29.510 --> 01:12:29.520 align:start position:0%
thank you representative representative
 
01:12:31.270 --> 01:12:31.280 align:start position:0%
from gene
 
01:12:35.030 --> 01:12:35.040 align:start position:0%
again thank you uh ginnygan represent
 
01:12:36.390 --> 01:12:36.400 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
01:12:39.590 --> 01:12:39.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:42.630 --> 01:12:42.640 align:start position:0%
i just want to maybe take a look at this
 
01:12:43.590 --> 01:12:43.600 align:start position:0%
in a slightly
 
01:12:47.110 --> 01:12:47.120 align:start position:0%
different way um i agree with many of
 
01:12:49.270 --> 01:12:49.280 align:start position:0%
the things
 
01:12:52.310 --> 01:12:52.320 align:start position:0%
that uh representative uh baxter said
 
01:12:56.709 --> 01:12:56.719 align:start position:0%
and um and also those who have um
 
01:13:00.390 --> 01:13:00.400 align:start position:0%
talked about the decreases um
 
01:13:04.950 --> 01:13:04.960 align:start position:0%
when businesses are increasing in um
 
01:13:06.870 --> 01:13:06.880 align:start position:0%
in profitability when when taxes are
 
01:13:07.990 --> 01:13:08.000 align:start position:0%
decreased but i want to look at a
 
01:13:08.870 --> 01:13:08.880 align:start position:0%
slightly different
 
01:13:11.430 --> 01:13:11.440 align:start position:0%
way as well um i think i think new
 
01:13:13.669 --> 01:13:13.679 align:start position:0%
hampshire can potentially use
 
01:13:15.910 --> 01:13:15.920 align:start position:0%
um i mean the covid thing yes it's
 
01:13:18.149 --> 01:13:18.159 align:start position:0%
created a lot of uncertainty
 
01:13:21.590 --> 01:13:21.600 align:start position:0%
but let's not forget that
 
01:13:24.310 --> 01:13:24.320 align:start position:0%
we are competing with other states let's
 
01:13:26.149 --> 01:13:26.159 align:start position:0%
make new hampshire as competitive as
 
01:13:26.159 --> 01:13:27.430 align:start position:0%
make new hampshire as competitive as
possible

01:13:27.430 --> 01:13:27.440 align:start position:0%
possible
 
01:13:30.470 --> 01:13:30.480 align:start position:0%
let's win this thing and basically
 
01:13:32.630 --> 01:13:32.640 align:start position:0%
new hampshire as massachusetts for
 
01:13:34.390 --> 01:13:34.400 align:start position:0%
example i just looked it up on the state
 
01:13:36.310 --> 01:13:36.320 align:start position:0%
their state website they have an eight
 
01:13:38.870 --> 01:13:38.880 align:start position:0%
percent business profits tax
 
01:13:42.950 --> 01:13:42.960 align:start position:0%
um at 7.5 percent we begin to
 
01:13:45.270 --> 01:13:45.280 align:start position:0%
separate ourselves from massachusetts
 
01:13:46.950 --> 01:13:46.960 align:start position:0%
we're seeing that
 
01:13:49.750 --> 01:13:49.760 align:start position:0%
from states like new york i mean people
 
01:13:50.790 --> 01:13:50.800 align:start position:0%
are fleeing
 
01:13:52.470 --> 01:13:52.480 align:start position:0%
businesses are fleeing states like
 
01:13:54.709 --> 01:13:54.719 align:start position:0%
california new york
 
01:13:57.750 --> 01:13:57.760 align:start position:0%
places where the tax burden is high
 
01:14:02.229 --> 01:14:02.239 align:start position:0%
the the covered restrictions are high
 
01:14:03.830 --> 01:14:03.840 align:start position:0%
while we do have covered restrictions
 
01:14:05.990 --> 01:14:06.000 align:start position:0%
they're nowhere as near as onerous
 
01:14:09.910 --> 01:14:09.920 align:start position:0%
as the states i just mentioned so
 
01:14:13.030 --> 01:14:13.040 align:start position:0%
new hampshire so as as people
 
01:14:16.070 --> 01:14:16.080 align:start position:0%
look around and say you know maybe we
 
01:14:18.070 --> 01:14:18.080 align:start position:0%
want to relocate towards to a state that
 
01:14:19.110 --> 01:14:19.120 align:start position:0%
has lower taxes
 
01:14:21.669 --> 01:14:21.679 align:start position:0%
less restrictions let's also look at our
 
01:14:22.950 --> 01:14:22.960 align:start position:0%
coveted numbers
 
01:14:25.270 --> 01:14:25.280 align:start position:0%
i just looked at this morning's update
 
01:14:26.550 --> 01:14:26.560 align:start position:0%
and it looks like
 
01:14:29.510 --> 01:14:29.520 align:start position:0%
we currently have about 3 170 active
 
01:14:29.520 --> 01:14:30.070 align:start position:0%
we currently have about 3 170 active
cases

01:14:30.070 --> 01:14:30.080 align:start position:0%
cases
 
01:14:33.189 --> 01:14:33.199 align:start position:0%
in the state down from over 6 000 just
 
01:14:34.709 --> 01:14:34.719 align:start position:0%
about a month ago
 
01:14:37.510 --> 01:14:37.520 align:start position:0%
we also have about 159 hospitalizations
 
01:14:39.270 --> 01:14:39.280 align:start position:0%
down from over 350
 
01:14:41.910 --> 01:14:41.920 align:start position:0%
about a month ago so we are we are
 
01:14:41.920 --> 01:14:42.870 align:start position:0%
about a month ago so we are we are
moving

01:14:42.870 --> 01:14:42.880 align:start position:0%
moving
 
01:14:45.910 --> 01:14:45.920 align:start position:0%
in a in a good direction even though
 
01:14:48.550 --> 01:14:48.560 align:start position:0%
we're in february this is typically a
 
01:14:50.390 --> 01:14:50.400 align:start position:0%
very cold month
 
01:14:53.669 --> 01:14:53.679 align:start position:0%
uh infections are typically high
 
01:14:55.750 --> 01:14:55.760 align:start position:0%
and yet we're moving in a very positive
 
01:14:58.310 --> 01:14:58.320 align:start position:0%
direction as far as coving cases
 
01:15:00.950 --> 01:15:00.960 align:start position:0%
so i think we use this opportunity to
 
01:15:00.960 --> 01:15:01.590 align:start position:0%
so i think we use this opportunity to
make

01:15:01.590 --> 01:15:01.600 align:start position:0%
make
 
01:15:04.070 --> 01:15:04.080 align:start position:0%
let's make new hampshire stand out let's
 
01:15:05.750 --> 01:15:05.760 align:start position:0%
think of this as a competition with
 
01:15:06.870 --> 01:15:06.880 align:start position:0%
other states
 
01:15:09.750 --> 01:15:09.760 align:start position:0%
and not just if we reduce the tax 0.2
 
01:15:09.760 --> 01:15:10.550 align:start position:0%
and not just if we reduce the tax 0.2
percent

01:15:10.550 --> 01:15:10.560 align:start position:0%
percent
 
01:15:12.390 --> 01:15:12.400 align:start position:0%
it's not going to make any difference
 
01:15:13.830 --> 01:15:13.840 align:start position:0%
let's also think about
 
01:15:15.990 --> 01:15:16.000 align:start position:0%
how it affects people emotionally who
 
01:15:17.830 --> 01:15:17.840 align:start position:0%
want to move and relocate from other
 
01:15:19.910 --> 01:15:19.920 align:start position:0%
states and that could that can be a huge
 
01:15:19.920 --> 01:15:20.709 align:start position:0%
states and that could that can be a huge
boon

01:15:20.709 --> 01:15:20.719 align:start position:0%
boon
 
01:15:23.430 --> 01:15:23.440 align:start position:0%
to new hampshire long term so i just
 
01:15:25.430 --> 01:15:25.440 align:start position:0%
wanted to add that perspective to this
 
01:15:28.229 --> 01:15:28.239 align:start position:0%
discussion thank you mr chairman thank
 
01:15:33.270 --> 01:15:33.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:39.430 --> 01:15:39.440 align:start position:0%
uh next is representative
 
01:15:41.350 --> 01:15:41.360 align:start position:0%
it's gorg you've got the two of us back
 
01:15:42.950 --> 01:15:42.960 align:start position:0%
to back the hard names
 
01:15:45.350 --> 01:15:45.360 align:start position:0%
um i just wanted to actually uh
 
01:15:46.550 --> 01:15:46.560 align:start position:0%
representative spoke
 
01:15:48.630 --> 01:15:48.640 align:start position:0%
i i completely agree with him we are in
 
01:15:49.910 --> 01:15:49.920 align:start position:0%
a great
 
01:15:53.110 --> 01:15:53.120 align:start position:0%
direction and um to echo others
 
01:15:56.790 --> 01:15:56.800 align:start position:0%
it's hard to change things when we are
 
01:15:58.470 --> 01:15:58.480 align:start position:0%
already in such a great
 
01:16:01.669 --> 01:16:01.679 align:start position:0%
position um and i just i also
 
01:16:04.310 --> 01:16:04.320 align:start position:0%
just a small comment new hampshire is so
 
01:16:04.320 --> 01:16:05.030 align:start position:0%
just a small comment new hampshire is so
unique

01:16:05.030 --> 01:16:05.040 align:start position:0%
unique
 
01:16:09.110 --> 01:16:09.120 align:start position:0%
we all know that um and the fact that
 
01:16:11.270 --> 01:16:11.280 align:start position:0%
we're comparing ourselves to other
 
01:16:12.390 --> 01:16:12.400 align:start position:0%
states that are not
 
01:16:14.229 --> 01:16:14.239 align:start position:0%
in the new england region is very
 
01:16:14.239 --> 01:16:15.430 align:start position:0%
in the new england region is very
difficult

01:16:15.430 --> 01:16:15.440 align:start position:0%
difficult
 
01:16:18.630 --> 01:16:18.640 align:start position:0%
i actually did just look up the west
 
01:16:19.990 --> 01:16:20.000 align:start position:0%
virginia center on
 
01:16:23.430 --> 01:16:23.440 align:start position:0%
budget and policy has many articles
 
01:16:26.790 --> 01:16:26.800 align:start position:0%
actually about why the business tax cut
 
01:16:30.070 --> 01:16:30.080 align:start position:0%
failed um they ended up um
 
01:16:33.270 --> 01:16:33.280 align:start position:0%
having horrible issues with this and i
 
01:16:34.709 --> 01:16:34.719 align:start position:0%
would encourage everybody to do a little
 
01:16:36.390 --> 01:16:36.400 align:start position:0%
bit more research if we're comparing to
 
01:16:36.400 --> 01:16:37.030 align:start position:0%
bit more research if we're comparing to
them

01:16:37.030 --> 01:16:37.040 align:start position:0%
them
 
01:16:39.750 --> 01:16:39.760 align:start position:0%
um especially with their education
 
01:16:39.760 --> 01:16:40.310 align:start position:0%
um especially with their education
funding

01:16:40.310 --> 01:16:40.320 align:start position:0%
funding
 
01:16:43.350 --> 01:16:43.360 align:start position:0%
which of course we we're not unique in
 
01:16:45.430 --> 01:16:45.440 align:start position:0%
that we do obviously have our education
 
01:16:49.030 --> 01:16:49.040 align:start position:0%
issues um but
 
01:16:51.750 --> 01:16:51.760 align:start position:0%
i mean if we have a good thing going and
 
01:16:53.430 --> 01:16:53.440 align:start position:0%
people are moving here and we've been
 
01:16:54.790 --> 01:16:54.800 align:start position:0%
told that our
 
01:16:58.709 --> 01:16:58.719 align:start position:0%
um population is growing
 
01:17:01.270 --> 01:17:01.280 align:start position:0%
now is not the time to mess with what we
 
01:17:01.280 --> 01:17:02.390 align:start position:0%
now is not the time to mess with what we
have

01:17:02.390 --> 01:17:02.400 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:17:04.070 --> 01:17:04.080 align:start position:0%
i don't know since i'm new to the
 
01:17:06.149 --> 01:17:06.159 align:start position:0%
committee why there's a sense of urgency
 
01:17:07.189 --> 01:17:07.199 align:start position:0%
to this
 
01:17:10.310 --> 01:17:10.320 align:start position:0%
um but i would love to see
 
01:17:12.950 --> 01:17:12.960 align:start position:0%
next year or the year after we we look
 
01:17:13.830 --> 01:17:13.840 align:start position:0%
at this again
 
01:17:15.430 --> 01:17:15.440 align:start position:0%
and kind of ride it out for right now
 
01:17:17.669 --> 01:17:17.679 align:start position:0%
and see what ends up happening
 
01:17:20.229 --> 01:17:20.239 align:start position:0%
so thank you well thank you
 
01:17:20.239 --> 01:17:23.910 align:start position:0%
so thank you well thank you
representative

01:17:23.910 --> 01:17:23.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:28.870 --> 01:17:28.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:32.310 --> 01:17:32.320 align:start position:0%
thank you already on
 
01:17:35.590 --> 01:17:35.600 align:start position:0%
first i want to to point out that phil
 
01:17:37.669 --> 01:17:37.679 align:start position:0%
slatten came out of the
 
01:17:41.189 --> 01:17:41.199 align:start position:0%
totally nonpartisan lbao
 
01:17:45.910 --> 01:17:45.920 align:start position:0%
audit program he has a very long history
 
01:17:49.669 --> 01:17:49.679 align:start position:0%
of extremely detailed data-driven
 
01:17:52.790 --> 01:17:52.800 align:start position:0%
analysis and
 
01:17:56.310 --> 01:17:56.320 align:start position:0%
he has been trying for
 
01:17:58.550 --> 01:17:58.560 align:start position:0%
some time to balance between both
 
01:18:01.110 --> 01:18:01.120 align:start position:0%
parties i realized that in the past
 
01:18:03.110 --> 01:18:03.120 align:start position:0%
the republicans even decided that the
 
01:18:05.590 --> 01:18:05.600 align:start position:0%
center for public policy studies
 
01:18:07.669 --> 01:18:07.679 align:start position:0%
which was founded by a republican and
 
01:18:08.870 --> 01:18:08.880 align:start position:0%
which had
 
01:18:11.990 --> 01:18:12.000 align:start position:0%
on speaker um
 
01:18:15.750 --> 01:18:15.760 align:start position:0%
oh i'm losing names now but had
 
01:18:18.950 --> 01:18:18.960 align:start position:0%
had our only woman republican speaker
 
01:18:21.510 --> 01:18:21.520 align:start position:0%
who was quite conservative on the board
 
01:18:21.520 --> 01:18:22.870 align:start position:0%
who was quite conservative on the board
and

01:18:22.870 --> 01:18:22.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:18:25.350 --> 01:18:25.360 align:start position:0%
had a board that went from very far left
 
01:18:26.550 --> 01:18:26.560 align:start position:0%
to very far right
 
01:18:28.790 --> 01:18:28.800 align:start position:0%
and mostly in the middle they were all
 
01:18:31.189 --> 01:18:31.199 align:start position:0%
committed to data analysis
 
01:18:34.310 --> 01:18:34.320 align:start position:0%
on the republicans at that time started
 
01:18:36.070 --> 01:18:36.080 align:start position:0%
to try to characterize it
 
01:18:39.189 --> 01:18:39.199 align:start position:0%
as left-wing because there was
 
01:18:42.950 --> 01:18:42.960 align:start position:0%
no no left wing
 
01:18:45.350 --> 01:18:45.360 align:start position:0%
place and i think that that's what is
 
01:18:45.360 --> 01:18:45.990 align:start position:0%
place and i think that that's what is
happening

01:18:45.990 --> 01:18:46.000 align:start position:0%
happening
 
01:18:48.870 --> 01:18:48.880 align:start position:0%
again it is very unfortunate for
 
01:18:50.229 --> 01:18:50.239 align:start position:0%
data-driven research
 
01:18:53.350 --> 01:18:53.360 align:start position:0%
in this country in this state
 
01:18:56.470 --> 01:18:56.480 align:start position:0%
but on i
 
01:18:58.950 --> 01:18:58.960 align:start position:0%
also wanted to point out that the whole
 
01:18:58.960 --> 01:19:00.229 align:start position:0%
also wanted to point out that the whole
country

01:19:00.229 --> 01:19:00.239 align:start position:0%
country
 
01:19:02.550 --> 01:19:02.560 align:start position:0%
is going in the right direction at the
 
01:19:04.229 --> 01:19:04.239 align:start position:0%
moment on covid but that
 
01:19:07.430 --> 01:19:07.440 align:start position:0%
the medical community is
 
01:19:11.110 --> 01:19:11.120 align:start position:0%
very worried about on this reversing
 
01:19:13.189 --> 01:19:13.199 align:start position:0%
with the variance spread
 
01:19:17.110 --> 01:19:17.120 align:start position:0%
right now in the whole country
 
01:19:20.870 --> 01:19:20.880 align:start position:0%
and that we are
 
01:19:24.229 --> 01:19:24.239 align:start position:0%
a very small state with the
 
01:19:27.189 --> 01:19:27.199 align:start position:0%
a unique completely unique track tax
 
01:19:27.199 --> 01:19:28.149 align:start position:0%
a unique completely unique track tax
structure

01:19:28.149 --> 01:19:28.159 align:start position:0%
structure
 
01:19:30.229 --> 01:19:30.239 align:start position:0%
that people in other states always ask
 
01:19:31.189 --> 01:19:31.199 align:start position:0%
me how
 
01:19:34.830 --> 01:19:34.840 align:start position:0%
do you do that uh and
 
01:19:37.830 --> 01:19:37.840 align:start position:0%
on we can't compare ourselves
 
01:19:40.229 --> 01:19:40.239 align:start position:0%
with giants that have the problems of
 
01:19:40.239 --> 01:19:41.110 align:start position:0%
with giants that have the problems of
giants

01:19:41.110 --> 01:19:41.120 align:start position:0%
giants
 
01:19:44.550 --> 01:19:44.560 align:start position:0%
in new york and california
 
01:19:48.870 --> 01:19:48.880 align:start position:0%
uh and texas so
 
01:19:52.709 --> 01:19:52.719 align:start position:0%
on that being said
 
01:19:56.390 --> 01:19:56.400 align:start position:0%
i wanted to point out another data
 
01:19:56.400 --> 01:19:57.350 align:start position:0%
i wanted to point out another data
driven

01:19:57.350 --> 01:19:57.360 align:start position:0%
driven
 
01:20:01.350 --> 01:20:01.360 align:start position:0%
group which does have a left
 
01:20:05.350 --> 01:20:05.360 align:start position:0%
left side approach to things but it is
 
01:20:08.550 --> 01:20:08.560 align:start position:0%
on it has the best micro macro
 
01:20:11.350 --> 01:20:11.360 align:start position:0%
economic model for taxation outside the
 
01:20:13.270 --> 01:20:13.280 align:start position:0%
congressional budget office
 
01:20:18.550 --> 01:20:18.560 align:start position:0%
and it has been doing that for 30 years
 
01:20:22.070 --> 01:20:22.080 align:start position:0%
that is the dc base
 
01:20:24.229 --> 01:20:24.239 align:start position:0%
institute on taxation and economic
 
01:20:26.629 --> 01:20:26.639 align:start position:0%
policy itep
 
01:20:30.550 --> 01:20:30.560 align:start position:0%
in 2017 as the congress prepared to pass
 
01:20:33.350 --> 01:20:33.360 align:start position:0%
massive federal tax cuts for the rich
 
01:20:35.110 --> 01:20:35.120 align:start position:0%
itep wrote the following to the
 
01:20:35.120 --> 01:20:36.709 align:start position:0%
itep wrote the following to the
lawmakers

01:20:36.709 --> 01:20:36.719 align:start position:0%
lawmakers
 
01:20:39.270 --> 01:20:39.280 align:start position:0%
for more than four decades supply-side
 
01:20:41.510 --> 01:20:41.520 align:start position:0%
ideologues have promoted the myth
 
01:20:43.470 --> 01:20:43.480 align:start position:0%
that tax cuts for the wealthy are
 
01:20:43.480 --> 01:20:44.790 align:start position:0%
that tax cuts for the wealthy are
self-financing

01:20:44.790 --> 01:20:44.800 align:start position:0%
self-financing
 
01:20:47.110 --> 01:20:47.120 align:start position:0%
and the benefits eventually trickle down
 
01:20:47.910 --> 01:20:47.920 align:start position:0%
to everyone
 
01:20:51.189 --> 01:20:51.199 align:start position:0%
else despite real-life evidence that tax
 
01:20:54.070 --> 01:20:54.080 align:start position:0%
cuts for the rich benefit the rich
 
01:20:56.629 --> 01:20:56.639 align:start position:0%
not even the reality of 40 years of
 
01:20:56.639 --> 01:20:57.270 align:start position:0%
not even the reality of 40 years of
widening

01:20:57.270 --> 01:20:57.280 align:start position:0%
widening
 
01:21:00.470 --> 01:21:00.480 align:start position:0%
economic income inequality
 
01:21:02.950 --> 01:21:02.960 align:start position:0%
or the current economic expansion in
 
01:21:04.790 --> 01:21:04.800 align:start position:0%
which the benefits primarily
 
01:21:07.110 --> 01:21:07.120 align:start position:0%
flowed to wealthy households have
 
01:21:08.470 --> 01:21:08.480 align:start position:0%
stopped anti-tax
 
01:21:11.750 --> 01:21:11.760 align:start position:0%
proponents from peddling the enormous
 
01:21:14.870 --> 01:21:14.880 align:start position:0%
uh erroneous idea that top heavy tax
 
01:21:16.870 --> 01:21:16.880 align:start position:0%
cuts will eventually benefit
 
01:21:20.149 --> 01:21:20.159 align:start position:0%
ordinary working people
 
01:21:22.790 --> 01:21:22.800 align:start position:0%
we know also from the latest edition of
 
01:21:24.550 --> 01:21:24.560 align:start position:0%
iteps who pays
 
01:21:27.669 --> 01:21:27.679 align:start position:0%
that in 2017 in new hampshire
 
01:21:29.990 --> 01:21:30.000 align:start position:0%
the top one percent of families paid
 
01:21:31.750 --> 01:21:31.760 align:start position:0%
only three percent of their income
 
01:21:34.550 --> 01:21:34.560 align:start position:0%
in state and local taxes whereas the
 
01:21:36.310 --> 01:21:36.320 align:start position:0%
lower 80 percent
 
01:21:39.590 --> 01:21:39.600 align:start position:0%
paid six and a half to nine percent of
 
01:21:40.870 --> 01:21:40.880 align:start position:0%
their income
 
01:21:44.550 --> 01:21:44.560 align:start position:0%
in taxes our business profits tax
 
01:21:45.990 --> 01:21:46.000 align:start position:0%
has been working against these
 
01:21:47.830 --> 01:21:47.840 align:start position:0%
inequities slightly reducing the
 
01:21:49.189 --> 01:21:49.199 align:start position:0%
economic the extreme
 
01:21:51.910 --> 01:21:51.920 align:start position:0%
advantage of our richest citizens
 
01:21:53.990 --> 01:21:54.000 align:start position:0%
because of this the new business
 
01:21:56.790 --> 01:21:56.800 align:start position:0%
tax cuts will further erode tax equity
 
01:21:58.550 --> 01:21:58.560 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire
 
01:22:01.110 --> 01:22:01.120 align:start position:0%
and because they are slight and will
 
01:22:02.870 --> 01:22:02.880 align:start position:0%
have no effect whatsoever
 
01:22:04.950 --> 01:22:04.960 align:start position:0%
on the economy except that they are
 
01:22:06.149 --> 01:22:06.159 align:start position:0%
going to cut
 
01:22:08.830 --> 01:22:08.840 align:start position:0%
services the businesses and the citizens
 
01:22:11.270 --> 01:22:11.280 align:start position:0%
need on
 
01:22:14.950 --> 01:22:14.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:18.149 --> 01:22:18.159 align:start position:0%
this is not going to greatly reduce
 
01:22:21.030 --> 01:22:21.040 align:start position:0%
tax equity in new hampshire but it is
 
01:22:23.750 --> 01:22:23.760 align:start position:0%
the end of a long series of tax cuts
 
01:22:27.189 --> 01:22:27.199 align:start position:0%
which have happened to coincide
 
01:22:31.350 --> 01:22:31.360 align:start position:0%
on before the tax impact has been felt
 
01:22:33.350 --> 01:22:33.360 align:start position:0%
of those tax cuts has happened to
 
01:22:33.360 --> 01:22:34.790 align:start position:0%
of those tax cuts has happened to
coincide

01:22:34.790 --> 01:22:34.800 align:start position:0%
coincide
 
01:22:38.470 --> 01:22:38.480 align:start position:0%
with uh national level
 
01:22:42.390 --> 01:22:42.400 align:start position:0%
and and state tax
 
01:22:46.709 --> 01:22:46.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:49.750 --> 01:22:49.760 align:start position:0%
waves that are built in to
 
01:22:52.390 --> 01:22:52.400 align:start position:0%
our system and into the federal system
 
01:22:54.310 --> 01:22:54.320 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:22:56.629 --> 01:22:56.639 align:start position:0%
thank you representative representative
 
01:22:56.639 --> 01:23:01.430 align:start position:0%
thank you representative representative
walkman

01:23:01.430 --> 01:23:01.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:04.470 --> 01:23:04.480 align:start position:0%
yeah mute can you hear me all right yes
 
01:23:06.790 --> 01:23:06.800 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chairman um i just
 
01:23:08.470 --> 01:23:08.480 align:start position:0%
wanted to point out a couple of things
 
01:23:11.270 --> 01:23:11.280 align:start position:0%
you know something that was uh well
 
01:23:12.870 --> 01:23:12.880 align:start position:0%
understood in the last term
 
01:23:15.669 --> 01:23:15.679 align:start position:0%
and that's as we were sort of evaluating
 
01:23:17.990 --> 01:23:18.000 align:start position:0%
the impact of the tax cuts that were
 
01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:18.870 align:start position:0%
the impact of the tax cuts that were
made

01:23:18.870 --> 01:23:18.880 align:start position:0%
made
 
01:23:22.550 --> 01:23:22.560 align:start position:0%
um it was also made clear that the
 
01:23:24.390 --> 01:23:24.400 align:start position:0%
massive repatriation
 
01:23:27.750 --> 01:23:27.760 align:start position:0%
of profits and our ability to tax those
 
01:23:27.760 --> 01:23:28.470 align:start position:0%
of profits and our ability to tax those
profits

01:23:28.470 --> 01:23:28.480 align:start position:0%
profits
 
01:23:31.910 --> 01:23:31.920 align:start position:0%
resulted in a huge but temporary
 
01:23:35.350 --> 01:23:35.360 align:start position:0%
revenue boost which really
 
01:23:38.870 --> 01:23:38.880 align:start position:0%
uh blurred the the sort of return on
 
01:23:38.880 --> 01:23:40.149 align:start position:0%
uh blurred the the sort of return on
investment

01:23:40.149 --> 01:23:40.159 align:start position:0%
investment
 
01:23:42.709 --> 01:23:42.719 align:start position:0%
assessment on how those tax cuts
 
01:23:45.030 --> 01:23:45.040 align:start position:0%
affected us but it was made clear that
 
01:23:47.270 --> 01:23:47.280 align:start position:0%
a massive amount of revenue came from
 
01:23:49.350 --> 01:23:49.360 align:start position:0%
that temporary repatriation of funds
 
01:23:51.430 --> 01:23:51.440 align:start position:0%
which is a federal
 
01:23:53.510 --> 01:23:53.520 align:start position:0%
law that was passed the tax cuts and
 
01:23:55.350 --> 01:23:55.360 align:start position:0%
jobs act
 
01:23:58.629 --> 01:23:58.639 align:start position:0%
we can't depend on that to happen again
 
01:24:01.189 --> 01:24:01.199 align:start position:0%
we should not forget that that's where
 
01:24:03.430 --> 01:24:03.440 align:start position:0%
those revenues came from
 
01:24:05.430 --> 01:24:05.440 align:start position:0%
and so the idea that those tax cuts paid
 
01:24:08.310 --> 01:24:08.320 align:start position:0%
for themselves i think we know better
 
01:24:12.229 --> 01:24:12.239 align:start position:0%
secondly you know we should hesitate to
 
01:24:14.070 --> 01:24:14.080 align:start position:0%
compare business tax rates with other
 
01:24:14.080 --> 01:24:14.870 align:start position:0%
compare business tax rates with other
states

01:24:14.870 --> 01:24:14.880 align:start position:0%
states
 
01:24:16.550 --> 01:24:16.560 align:start position:0%
i think that's way too narrow of you
 
01:24:19.270 --> 01:24:19.280 align:start position:0%
considering you know we don't have taxes
 
01:24:22.310 --> 01:24:22.320 align:start position:0%
that those states do
 
01:24:24.229 --> 01:24:24.239 align:start position:0%
also our property taxes are a burden
 
01:24:26.070 --> 01:24:26.080 align:start position:0%
that those other states don't have
 
01:24:27.910 --> 01:24:27.920 align:start position:0%
and i think the most appropriate way to
 
01:24:30.550 --> 01:24:30.560 align:start position:0%
assess the tax burden for businesses
 
01:24:31.910 --> 01:24:31.920 align:start position:0%
that want to come to new hampshire or
 
01:24:33.430 --> 01:24:33.440 align:start position:0%
state new hampshire is to look at things
 
01:24:33.440 --> 01:24:35.270 align:start position:0%
state new hampshire is to look at things
holistically

01:24:35.270 --> 01:24:35.280 align:start position:0%
holistically
 
01:24:38.310 --> 01:24:38.320 align:start position:0%
and we already have a very friendly
 
01:24:39.830 --> 01:24:39.840 align:start position:0%
business tax environment when you
 
01:24:41.590 --> 01:24:41.600 align:start position:0%
consider all the taxes that we don't
 
01:24:41.600 --> 01:24:42.709 align:start position:0%
consider all the taxes that we don't
have

01:24:42.709 --> 01:24:42.719 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:24:44.390 --> 01:24:44.400 align:start position:0%
and if we're really interested in making
 
01:24:45.830 --> 01:24:45.840 align:start position:0%
things easier for business we should
 
01:24:46.870 --> 01:24:46.880 align:start position:0%
look at what we can do
 
01:24:50.070 --> 01:24:50.080 align:start position:0%
for property taxes uh and finally
 
01:24:52.629 --> 01:24:52.639 align:start position:0%
just sort of a kind of a personal
 
01:24:54.070 --> 01:24:54.080 align:start position:0%
opinion here you know
 
01:24:57.270 --> 01:24:57.280 align:start position:0%
we talk a lot about other states
 
01:24:59.750 --> 01:24:59.760 align:start position:0%
and the idea that people are businesses
 
01:25:02.070 --> 01:25:02.080 align:start position:0%
are fleeing these other states and
 
01:25:03.990 --> 01:25:04.000 align:start position:0%
disregard completely that these states
 
01:25:05.910 --> 01:25:05.920 align:start position:0%
have massive economies in part because
 
01:25:07.430 --> 01:25:07.440 align:start position:0%
of the investments they make in their
 
01:25:09.750 --> 01:25:09.760 align:start position:0%
infrastructure in education
 
01:25:12.870 --> 01:25:12.880 align:start position:0%
which makes people want to invest with
 
01:25:14.390 --> 01:25:14.400 align:start position:0%
their businesses and with their families
 
01:25:15.750 --> 01:25:15.760 align:start position:0%
in those states
 
01:25:18.470 --> 01:25:18.480 align:start position:0%
and it's always struck me as a bit
 
01:25:20.229 --> 01:25:20.239 align:start position:0%
disingenuous that we
 
01:25:23.030 --> 01:25:23.040 align:start position:0%
you know mock these states at the same
 
01:25:24.229 --> 01:25:24.239 align:start position:0%
time that we
 
01:25:26.149 --> 01:25:26.159 align:start position:0%
talk about wanting to pursue a greater
 
01:25:28.629 --> 01:25:28.639 align:start position:0%
and stronger economy for new hampshire
 
01:25:31.510 --> 01:25:31.520 align:start position:0%
we mock states that have rather
 
01:25:32.950 --> 01:25:32.960 align:start position:0%
impressive economies
 
01:25:36.229 --> 01:25:36.239 align:start position:0%
um so you know i i agree that new
 
01:25:37.990 --> 01:25:38.000 align:start position:0%
hampshire is a unique and special place
 
01:25:40.310 --> 01:25:40.320 align:start position:0%
and we should protect that
 
01:25:43.110 --> 01:25:43.120 align:start position:0%
but you know investments there's a
 
01:25:44.229 --> 01:25:44.239 align:start position:0%
difference between a cost and an
 
01:25:45.990 --> 01:25:46.000 align:start position:0%
investment and i i
 
01:25:47.830 --> 01:25:47.840 align:start position:0%
really fear for new hampshire's future
 
01:25:49.830 --> 01:25:49.840 align:start position:0%
if we continue to divest
 
01:25:53.270 --> 01:25:53.280 align:start position:0%
at a time when i think we could be
 
01:25:55.189 --> 01:25:55.199 align:start position:0%
protecting these revenue streams
 
01:25:57.030 --> 01:25:57.040 align:start position:0%
investing in education
 
01:26:00.229 --> 01:26:00.239 align:start position:0%
uh lowering property taxes uh
 
01:26:01.590 --> 01:26:01.600 align:start position:0%
and you know really investing in our
 
01:26:03.430 --> 01:26:03.440 align:start position:0%
future that's all i wanted to say thank
 
01:26:03.440 --> 01:26:06.070 align:start position:0%
future that's all i wanted to say thank

thank you representative uh
 
01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:09.189 align:start position:0%
thank you representative uh

01:26:09.199 --> 01:26:18.550 align:start position:0%
representative
romney

01:26:18.550 --> 01:26:18.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:22.229 --> 01:26:22.239 align:start position:0%
are you muted pat
 
01:26:25.430 --> 01:26:25.440 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair uh we've
 
01:26:27.510 --> 01:26:27.520 align:start position:0%
you know we've had our own experiment
 
01:26:27.520 --> 01:26:28.790 align:start position:0%
you know we've had our own experiment
here

01:26:28.790 --> 01:26:28.800 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:26:31.669 --> 01:26:31.679 align:start position:0%
we have actual real data if you looked
 
01:26:32.790 --> 01:26:32.800 align:start position:0%
at the graph that
 
01:26:34.629 --> 01:26:34.639 align:start position:0%
representative major used and when he
 
01:26:36.390 --> 01:26:36.400 align:start position:0%
introduced a bill
 
01:26:40.229 --> 01:26:40.239 align:start position:0%
from 2011 to 2015
 
01:26:43.510 --> 01:26:43.520 align:start position:0%
our our business tax growth was anemic
 
01:26:46.550 --> 01:26:46.560 align:start position:0%
it averaged about 534 million dollars
 
01:26:49.110 --> 01:26:49.120 align:start position:0%
annually but there was really no growth
 
01:26:50.709 --> 01:26:50.719 align:start position:0%
going on
 
01:26:54.870 --> 01:26:54.880 align:start position:0%
when you look at 2016 to 2020
 
01:26:57.669 --> 01:26:57.679 align:start position:0%
that number jumped to 727 million
 
01:26:57.679 --> 01:26:58.790 align:start position:0%
that number jumped to 727 million
average

01:26:58.790 --> 01:26:58.800 align:start position:0%
average
 
01:27:00.629 --> 01:27:00.639 align:start position:0%
so we compared average five years to
 
01:27:03.270 --> 01:27:03.280 align:start position:0%
another average five years 534 million
 
01:27:08.390 --> 01:27:08.400 align:start position:0%
to 727 million or 193 million growth
 
01:27:10.950 --> 01:27:10.960 align:start position:0%
yes it is true in that math for the last
 
01:27:11.910 --> 01:27:11.920 align:start position:0%
five years as
 
01:27:14.629 --> 01:27:14.639 align:start position:0%
was the repatriation but also for the
 
01:27:17.270 --> 01:27:17.280 align:start position:0%
last year in that number the 2020
 
01:27:20.149 --> 01:27:20.159 align:start position:0%
there was a hit due to covet which kind
 
01:27:21.270 --> 01:27:21.280 align:start position:0%
of i won't say it
 
01:27:24.950 --> 01:27:24.960 align:start position:0%
absolutely cancels out each other but uh
 
01:27:28.709 --> 01:27:28.719 align:start position:0%
but even if you said 193 million average
 
01:27:31.510 --> 01:27:31.520 align:start position:0%
growth was too high take out
 
01:27:31.520 --> 01:27:32.709 align:start position:0%
growth was too high take out
repatriation

01:27:32.709 --> 01:27:32.719 align:start position:0%
repatriation
 
01:27:35.110 --> 01:27:35.120 align:start position:0%
for that one year you know maybe that's
 
01:27:36.790 --> 01:27:36.800 align:start position:0%
maybe the average is 150 million
 
01:27:36.800 --> 01:27:37.350 align:start position:0%
maybe the average is 150 million
increase

01:27:37.350 --> 01:27:37.360 align:start position:0%
increase
 
01:27:39.750 --> 01:27:39.760 align:start position:0%
in revenues i mean if i came down from
 
01:27:41.350 --> 01:27:41.360 align:start position:0%
mars and i looked at this graph and i
 
01:27:41.360 --> 01:27:42.229 align:start position:0%
mars and i looked at this graph and i
said

01:27:42.229 --> 01:27:42.239 align:start position:0%
said
 
01:27:44.709 --> 01:27:44.719 align:start position:0%
wow look at those look at those first
 
01:27:46.629 --> 01:27:46.639 align:start position:0%
five years there boy that's
 
01:27:49.110 --> 01:27:49.120 align:start position:0%
that's not much growth at all and then
 
01:27:50.550 --> 01:27:50.560 align:start position:0%
it just jumped right off the scale when
 
01:27:51.590 --> 01:27:51.600 align:start position:0%
you look at the chart
 
01:27:54.709 --> 01:27:54.719 align:start position:0%
and it all started in 2016
 
01:27:56.070 --> 01:27:56.080 align:start position:0%
when we had our first incremental
 
01:27:58.390 --> 01:27:58.400 align:start position:0%
reduction in in taxes
 
01:28:01.270 --> 01:28:01.280 align:start position:0%
again i i'm i've i'm i'm i've no
 
01:28:01.280 --> 01:28:02.629 align:start position:0%
again i i'm i've i'm i'm i've no
statistics

01:28:02.629 --> 01:28:02.639 align:start position:0%
statistics
 
01:28:04.390 --> 01:28:04.400 align:start position:0%
i know this is really a multivariate
 
01:28:06.070 --> 01:28:06.080 align:start position:0%
issue but
 
01:28:08.149 --> 01:28:08.159 align:start position:0%
if we just focus on that and that cause
 
01:28:10.149 --> 01:28:10.159 align:start position:0%
and effect is caused by many things and
 
01:28:10.159 --> 01:28:10.870 align:start position:0%
and effect is caused by many things and
effective

01:28:10.870 --> 01:28:10.880 align:start position:0%
effective
 
01:28:14.070 --> 01:28:14.080 align:start position:0%
and all of that but i i i
 
01:28:15.750 --> 01:28:15.760 align:start position:0%
can't walk away by just looking at this
 
01:28:17.270 --> 01:28:17.280 align:start position:0%
chart by saying
 
01:28:19.110 --> 01:28:19.120 align:start position:0%
uh the tax cuts didn't have some
 
01:28:20.950 --> 01:28:20.960 align:start position:0%
positive impact on
 
01:28:24.070 --> 01:28:24.080 align:start position:0%
very increased significant increases in
 
01:28:25.830 --> 01:28:25.840 align:start position:0%
our our revenues
 
01:28:28.390 --> 01:28:28.400 align:start position:0%
from our businesses and we talk about
 
01:28:28.400 --> 01:28:29.690 align:start position:0%
from our businesses and we talk about
education

01:28:29.690 --> 01:28:29.700 align:start position:0%
education
 
01:28:29.700 --> 01:28:31.510 align:start position:0%
education
[Music]

01:28:31.510 --> 01:28:31.520 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:28:33.669 --> 01:28:33.679 align:start position:0%
we have to remind ourselves we are
 
01:28:33.679 --> 01:28:34.629 align:start position:0%
we have to remind ourselves we are
ranked

01:28:34.629 --> 01:28:34.639 align:start position:0%
ranked
 
01:28:37.350 --> 01:28:37.360 align:start position:0%
very very high on our education system
 
01:28:37.360 --> 01:28:38.310 align:start position:0%
very very high on our education system
here

01:28:38.310 --> 01:28:38.320 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:28:41.350 --> 01:28:41.360 align:start position:0%
doing things the way we do them uh
 
01:28:43.750 --> 01:28:43.760 align:start position:0%
we are the outcomes the outcome measures
 
01:28:45.669 --> 01:28:45.679 align:start position:0%
that which is the most important thing
 
01:28:48.550 --> 01:28:48.560 align:start position:0%
the outcome scores of our students in
 
01:28:49.510 --> 01:28:49.520 align:start position:0%
this state
 
01:28:51.189 --> 01:28:51.199 align:start position:0%
are extremely high compared to most
 
01:28:52.550 --> 01:28:52.560 align:start position:0%
other states
 
01:28:55.030 --> 01:28:55.040 align:start position:0%
so uh you know we can use all the
 
01:28:56.709 --> 01:28:56.719 align:start position:0%
arguments we want
 
01:28:59.110 --> 01:28:59.120 align:start position:0%
uh all we're trying to do with this bill
 
01:29:00.709 --> 01:29:00.719 align:start position:0%
is to continue to stimulus
 
01:29:03.510 --> 01:29:03.520 align:start position:0%
our business businesses to stay here and
 
01:29:04.870 --> 01:29:04.880 align:start position:0%
to move here
 
01:29:06.470 --> 01:29:06.480 align:start position:0%
and i think from the chart that was
 
01:29:08.550 --> 01:29:08.560 align:start position:0%
handed out and if you
 
01:29:10.790 --> 01:29:10.800 align:start position:0%
i find it hard to argue that there
 
01:29:12.870 --> 01:29:12.880 align:start position:0%
wasn't some success here
 
01:29:15.189 --> 01:29:15.199 align:start position:0%
uh you know the only only thing that you
 
01:29:16.149 --> 01:29:16.159 align:start position:0%
could argue is that maybe the
 
01:29:18.070 --> 01:29:18.080 align:start position:0%
repatriation helped
 
01:29:20.470 --> 01:29:20.480 align:start position:0%
but but even after the repatriation
 
01:29:20.480 --> 01:29:21.270 align:start position:0%
but but even after the repatriation
ended

01:29:21.270 --> 01:29:21.280 align:start position:0%
ended
 
01:29:24.470 --> 01:29:24.480 align:start position:0%
even in the covert year we were we were
 
01:29:27.030 --> 01:29:27.040 align:start position:0%
significantly above where we were you
 
01:29:28.550 --> 01:29:28.560 align:start position:0%
know five years ago
 
01:29:31.110 --> 01:29:31.120 align:start position:0%
or four years ago so i'll leave it at
 
01:29:31.120 --> 01:29:31.590 align:start position:0%
or four years ago so i'll leave it at
that

01:29:31.590 --> 01:29:31.600 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:29:33.830 --> 01:29:33.840 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you
 
01:29:35.110 --> 01:29:35.120 align:start position:0%
representative romney
 
01:29:39.189 --> 01:29:39.199 align:start position:0%
representative elliott
 
01:29:47.110 --> 01:29:47.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:50.629 --> 01:29:50.639 align:start position:0%
you're still muted bob okay
 
01:29:53.990 --> 01:29:54.000 align:start position:0%
yes sorry about that um
 
01:29:56.390 --> 01:29:56.400 align:start position:0%
correct me if i'm wrong but it's my
 
01:29:59.110 --> 01:29:59.120 align:start position:0%
understanding now that
 
01:30:03.189 --> 01:30:03.199 align:start position:0%
the businessman pays 35
 
01:30:06.390 --> 01:30:06.400 align:start position:0%
of our state budget
 
01:30:10.229 --> 01:30:10.239 align:start position:0%
um and i
 
01:30:13.750 --> 01:30:13.760 align:start position:0%
and i also believe that um
 
01:30:16.709 --> 01:30:16.719 align:start position:0%
many businesses are not in deep trouble
 
01:30:18.470 --> 01:30:18.480 align:start position:0%
right now but many of them have gone out
 
01:30:19.189 --> 01:30:19.199 align:start position:0%
of business
 
01:30:22.550 --> 01:30:22.560 align:start position:0%
completely so i look at this bill in a
 
01:30:25.430 --> 01:30:25.440 align:start position:0%
more simple way than the scholarly
 
01:30:28.310 --> 01:30:28.320 align:start position:0%
presentations that i've just heard
 
01:30:32.709 --> 01:30:32.719 align:start position:0%
as a way of helping the businessman
 
01:30:35.750 --> 01:30:35.760 align:start position:0%
because if i lower his tax bill
 
01:30:38.790 --> 01:30:38.800 align:start position:0%
by any uh measure that to me
 
01:30:41.189 --> 01:30:41.199 align:start position:0%
is going to help him and right now i
 
01:30:43.350 --> 01:30:43.360 align:start position:0%
feel that the businessman needs our help
 
01:30:44.390 --> 01:30:44.400 align:start position:0%
and that's the whole
 
01:30:48.229 --> 01:30:48.239 align:start position:0%
purpose of this bill now if i'm wrong
 
01:30:51.830 --> 01:30:51.840 align:start position:0%
and if it doesn't work out
 
01:30:54.470 --> 01:30:54.480 align:start position:0%
in two years we can always change the
 
01:30:55.510 --> 01:30:55.520 align:start position:0%
rate back
 
01:30:58.950 --> 01:30:58.960 align:start position:0%
to the present rate and that way
 
01:31:02.070 --> 01:31:02.080 align:start position:0%
uh the other side will have their
 
01:31:06.709 --> 01:31:06.719 align:start position:0%
victory as well so i'll be brief
 
01:31:09.830 --> 01:31:09.840 align:start position:0%
i'm in favor of this bill i think it
 
01:31:11.910 --> 01:31:11.920 align:start position:0%
time we help the business man thank you
 
01:31:14.709 --> 01:31:14.719 align:start position:0%
very much mr chairman
 
01:31:16.070 --> 01:31:16.080 align:start position:0%
thank you represent elliott

01:31:27.669 --> 01:31:27.679 align:start position:0%
yes i i wanted to uh read to you
 
01:31:29.830 --> 01:31:29.840 align:start position:0%
a letter that i got from a constituent
 
01:31:32.629 --> 01:31:32.639 align:start position:0%
that i actually don't know
 
01:31:34.470 --> 01:31:34.480 align:start position:0%

and in whitefield in particular we pay
 
01:32:32.950 --> 01:32:32.960 align:start position:0%
higher than average compared to the rest
 
01:32:34.390 --> 01:32:34.400 align:start position:0%
of the state
 
01:32:36.390 --> 01:32:36.400 align:start position:0%
where do you expect to make up this
 
01:32:38.550 --> 01:32:38.560 align:start position:0%
extra money
 
01:32:40.950 --> 01:32:40.960 align:start position:0%
and how do you expect people to continue
 
01:32:42.070 --> 01:32:42.080 align:start position:0%
living here
 
01:32:45.750 --> 01:32:45.760 align:start position:0%
if property rates continue to go up
 
01:32:47.510 --> 01:32:47.520 align:start position:0%
why would you eliminate a tax on
 
01:32:49.189 --> 01:32:49.199 align:start position:0%
interest in dividends
 
01:32:52.310 --> 01:32:52.320 align:start position:0%
in reality this tax only affects
 
01:32:54.870 --> 01:32:54.880 align:start position:0%
rich people but getting rid of it will
 
01:32:54.880 --> 01:32:55.430 align:start position:0%
rich people but getting rid of it will
affect

01:32:55.430 --> 01:32:55.440 align:start position:0%
affect
 
01:32:58.070 --> 01:32:58.080 align:start position:0%
all of us who are struggling just to pay
 
01:33:00.229 --> 01:33:00.239 align:start position:0%
our property taxes
 
01:33:02.070 --> 01:33:02.080 align:start position:0%
i think something needs to be done
 
01:33:02.080 --> 01:33:03.430 align:start position:0%
i think something needs to be done
statewide

01:33:03.430 --> 01:33:03.440 align:start position:0%
statewide
 
01:33:06.229 --> 01:33:06.239 align:start position:0%
to do something about our ridiculously
 
01:33:08.950 --> 01:33:08.960 align:start position:0%
high property tax rates
 
01:33:13.110 --> 01:33:13.120 align:start position:0%
so i think this is not an unusual
 
01:33:16.310 --> 01:33:16.320 align:start position:0%
view by citizens
 
01:33:18.310 --> 01:33:18.320 align:start position:0%
not only of the north country but across
 
01:33:19.430 --> 01:33:19.440 align:start position:0%
the state
 
01:33:23.669 --> 01:33:23.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:26.629 --> 01:33:26.639 align:start position:0%
state is picking up less of municipal
 
01:33:26.639 --> 01:33:28.950 align:start position:0%
state is picking up less of municipal
costs

01:33:28.950 --> 01:33:28.960 align:start position:0%
costs
 
01:33:31.350 --> 01:33:31.360 align:start position:0%
retirement costs so when you go to a
 
01:33:32.950 --> 01:33:32.960 align:start position:0%
selections meeting
 
01:33:35.669 --> 01:33:35.679 align:start position:0%
you hear them talk about these things
 
01:33:37.750 --> 01:33:37.760 align:start position:0%
that are in the municipal budgets
 
01:33:41.110 --> 01:33:41.120 align:start position:0%
that they can't control retirement costs
 
01:33:42.790 --> 01:33:42.800 align:start position:0%
being one of them
 
01:33:45.990 --> 01:33:46.000 align:start position:0%
other aspects of policing and so forth
 
01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:46.629 align:start position:0%
other aspects of policing and so forth
that

01:33:46.629 --> 01:33:46.639 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:33:49.750 --> 01:33:49.760 align:start position:0%
people want to have and it costs them
 
01:33:51.189 --> 01:33:51.199 align:start position:0%
more money now
 
01:33:54.790 --> 01:33:54.800 align:start position:0%
and this difficulty that people are
 
01:33:57.430 --> 01:33:57.440 align:start position:0%
having with paying their property taxes
 
01:33:59.590 --> 01:33:59.600 align:start position:0%
it means it's hard for young people to
 
01:34:01.270 --> 01:34:01.280 align:start position:0%
afford housing
 
01:34:03.990 --> 01:34:04.000 align:start position:0%
even if they can afford to buy the house
 
01:34:06.229 --> 01:34:06.239 align:start position:0%
then they have to pay the property tax
 
01:34:07.910 --> 01:34:07.920 align:start position:0%
every year
 
01:34:10.470 --> 01:34:10.480 align:start position:0%
and it affects the elder citizens and
 
01:34:12.070 --> 01:34:12.080 align:start position:0%
here in
 
01:34:15.030 --> 01:34:15.040 align:start position:0%
northern new hampshire i'm typical i'm
 
01:34:15.040 --> 01:34:15.510 align:start position:0%
northern new hampshire i'm typical i'm
an

01:34:15.510 --> 01:34:15.520 align:start position:0%
an
 
01:34:18.390 --> 01:34:18.400 align:start position:0%
older citizen and the property taxes
 
01:34:20.229 --> 01:34:20.239 align:start position:0%
become more difficult
 
01:34:24.390 --> 01:34:24.400 align:start position:0%
every year so i ask you
 
01:34:27.270 --> 01:34:27.280 align:start position:0%
not this year when we're struggling as a
 
01:34:27.280 --> 01:34:28.070 align:start position:0%
not this year when we're struggling as a
state

01:34:28.070 --> 01:34:28.080 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:34:29.750 --> 01:34:29.760 align:start position:0%
like the rest of the country to deal
 
01:34:31.990 --> 01:34:32.000 align:start position:0%
with what this pandemic will mean
 
01:34:36.149 --> 01:34:36.159 align:start position:0%
to us not to cut business taxes
 
01:34:41.590 --> 01:34:41.600 align:start position:0%
this year and not to support this bill
 
01:34:44.950 --> 01:34:44.960 align:start position:0%
thank you dr representative tucker uh
 
01:34:46.790 --> 01:34:46.800 align:start position:0%
representative model and then we're
 
01:34:50.550 --> 01:34:50.560 align:start position:0%
going to take a five minute break
 
01:34:54.790 --> 01:34:54.800 align:start position:0%
representative camaro thank you mr chair
 
01:34:57.510 --> 01:34:57.520 align:start position:0%
um i wanted to point out that the
 
01:34:59.270 --> 01:34:59.280 align:start position:0%
numbers that came in
 
01:35:01.910 --> 01:35:01.920 align:start position:0%
you know the final numbers for 2020 for
 
01:35:04.470 --> 01:35:04.480 align:start position:0%
the state in june
 
01:35:09.189 --> 01:35:09.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:11.109 --> 01:35:11.119 align:start position:0%
i would would it be the four months of
 
01:35:11.119 --> 01:35:12.550 align:start position:0%
i would would it be the four months of
covid

01:35:12.550 --> 01:35:12.560 align:start position:0%
covid
 
01:35:15.189 --> 01:35:15.199 align:start position:0%
march april may june though those
 
01:35:15.199 --> 01:35:16.470 align:start position:0%
march april may june though those
figures

01:35:16.470 --> 01:35:16.480 align:start position:0%
figures
 
01:35:21.830 --> 01:35:21.840 align:start position:0%
those those receipts were based on 2019
 
01:35:25.830 --> 01:35:25.840 align:start position:0%
profits from various businesses they had
 
01:35:29.189 --> 01:35:29.199 align:start position:0%
nothing to do with 2020. the only
 
01:35:31.910 --> 01:35:31.920 align:start position:0%
thing that had to do with 2020 is the
 
01:35:31.920 --> 01:35:33.430 align:start position:0%
thing that had to do with 2020 is the
estimates

01:35:33.430 --> 01:35:33.440 align:start position:0%
estimates
 
01:35:36.790 --> 01:35:36.800 align:start position:0%
which are based on 2019
 
01:35:38.790 --> 01:35:38.800 align:start position:0%
so i don't think we can look at the
 
01:35:40.629 --> 01:35:40.639 align:start position:0%
final numbers for that year
 
01:35:43.109 --> 01:35:43.119 align:start position:0%
and say oh look we did great even in the
 
01:35:44.470 --> 01:35:44.480 align:start position:0%
time of covid because
 
01:35:47.990 --> 01:35:48.000 align:start position:0%
we weren't in the time of covid in 2019
 
01:35:51.910 --> 01:35:51.920 align:start position:0%
and everything that came in
 
01:35:55.430 --> 01:35:55.440 align:start position:0%
from january to to june was based on
 
01:35:55.440 --> 01:35:57.109 align:start position:0%
from january to to june was based on
2019.

01:35:57.109 --> 01:35:57.119 align:start position:0%
2019.
 
01:35:59.109 --> 01:35:59.119 align:start position:0%
so i just wanted to point that out thank
 
01:35:59.119 --> 01:36:00.229 align:start position:0%
so i just wanted to point that out thank
you

01:36:00.229 --> 01:36:00.239 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:36:03.030 --> 01:36:03.040 align:start position:0%
okay uh there's no other hands let's
 
01:36:04.950 --> 01:36:04.960 align:start position:0%
take a five minute break
 
01:36:08.470 --> 01:36:08.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:12.310 --> 01:36:12.320 align:start position:0%
mr chair yes i there was one attendee
 
01:36:14.149 --> 01:36:14.159 align:start position:0%
that set his hand up the whole time
 
01:36:17.270 --> 01:36:17.280 align:start position:0%
i didn't know if you wanted to i will
 
01:36:19.270 --> 01:36:19.280 align:start position:0%
take him first right after
 
01:36:37.350 --> 01:36:37.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:37.360 --> 01:38:57.830 align:start position:0%
 
you

01:38:57.830 --> 01:38:57.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:57.840 --> 01:43:08.830 align:start position:0%
 
you

01:43:08.830 --> 01:43:08.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:08.840 --> 01:43:23.910 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:43:23.910 --> 01:43:23.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:23.920 --> 01:43:30.629 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:43:30.629 --> 01:43:30.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:36.550 --> 01:43:36.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:40.310 --> 01:43:40.320 align:start position:0%
that was a nice idea mr chairman
 
01:43:46.070 --> 01:43:46.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:49.189 --> 01:43:49.199 align:start position:0%
all right on house bill 10
 
01:43:52.629 --> 01:43:52.639 align:start position:0%
we've heard a lot of discussion we're
 
01:43:53.270 --> 01:43:53.280 align:start position:0%
going to
 
01:43:57.350 --> 01:43:57.360 align:start position:0%
uh exact that tomorrow
 
01:43:59.189 --> 01:43:59.199 align:start position:0%
and tomorrow when it comes to the exec
 
01:44:01.910 --> 01:44:01.920 align:start position:0%
for house bill 10
 
01:44:04.830 --> 01:44:04.840 align:start position:0%
we don't want to repeat any of the
 
01:44:04.840 --> 01:44:06.070 align:start position:0%
we don't want to repeat any of the
discussion

01:44:06.070 --> 01:44:06.080 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
01:44:09.350 --> 01:44:09.360 align:start position:0%
if there's any new discussion fine but i
 
01:44:09.360 --> 01:44:10.629 align:start position:0%
if there's any new discussion fine but i
think

01:44:10.629 --> 01:44:10.639 align:start position:0%
think
 
01:44:12.790 --> 01:44:12.800 align:start position:0%
people know how they really want to vote
 
01:44:14.470 --> 01:44:14.480 align:start position:0%
on this
 
01:44:18.149 --> 01:44:18.159 align:start position:0%
and and the good reason reason that they
 
01:44:20.070 --> 01:44:20.080 align:start position:0%
feel they want to vote on this on each
 
01:44:20.080 --> 01:44:21.510 align:start position:0%
feel they want to vote on this on each
side

01:44:21.510 --> 01:44:21.520 align:start position:0%
side
 
01:44:23.350 --> 01:44:23.360 align:start position:0%
i don't think we're going to change
 
01:44:25.590 --> 01:44:25.600 align:start position:0%
anybody's views
 
01:44:28.870 --> 01:44:28.880 align:start position:0%
so when we get back to house bill 10
 
01:44:28.880 --> 01:44:31.109 align:start position:0%
so when we get back to house bill 10
tomorrow

01:44:31.109 --> 01:44:31.119 align:start position:0%
tomorrow
 
01:44:33.590 --> 01:44:33.600 align:start position:0%
unless there's new information i think
 
01:44:35.910 --> 01:44:35.920 align:start position:0%
we need to
 
01:44:39.030 --> 01:44:39.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:42.790 --> 01:44:42.800 align:start position:0%
mr chairman there was apparently i have
 
01:44:44.149 --> 01:44:44.159 align:start position:0%
no idea who it was
 
01:44:46.070 --> 01:44:46.080 align:start position:0%
someone who had their hand up for quite
 
01:44:47.350 --> 01:44:47.360 align:start position:0%
a long time before
 
01:44:50.390 --> 01:44:50.400 align:start position:0%
and you said you'd take him or her after
 
01:44:57.350 --> 01:44:57.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:00.950 --> 01:45:00.960 align:start position:0%

01:53:57.430 --> 01:53:57.440 align:start position:0%
beginning
 
01:54:00.149 --> 01:54:00.159 align:start position:0%
because i was uh addressing a question
 
01:54:00.159 --> 01:54:00.790 align:start position:0%
because i was uh addressing a question
to

01:54:00.790 --> 01:54:00.800 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:54:05.030 --> 01:54:05.040 align:start position:0%
to the previous speaker can you hear me
 
01:54:07.589 --> 01:54:07.599 align:start position:0%
she's in and out i guess i'm too close
 
01:54:08.870 --> 01:54:08.880 align:start position:0%
to lebanon
 
01:54:11.270 --> 01:54:11.280 align:start position:0%
you were going out too tom yeah i can
 
01:54:12.790 --> 01:54:12.800 align:start position:0%
hear you now
 
01:54:16.229 --> 01:54:16.239 align:start position:0%
okay so can you hear me yeah
 
01:54:19.270 --> 01:54:19.280 align:start position:0%
he said he goes yes okay no i don't
 
01:54:22.470 --> 01:54:22.480 align:start position:0%
have any i do susan i don't have any
 
01:54:25.910 --> 01:54:25.920 align:start position:0%
uh facts or data on that this is a
 
01:54:29.030 --> 01:54:29.040 align:start position:0%
philosophical approach okay well i i
 
01:54:30.550 --> 01:54:30.560 align:start position:0%
will continue then
 
01:54:33.990 --> 01:54:34.000 align:start position:0%
the uh current
 
01:54:37.350 --> 01:54:37.360 align:start position:0%
small businesses that do
 
01:54:39.669 --> 01:54:39.679 align:start position:0%
collect and pay this tax that are
 
01:54:40.629 --> 01:54:40.639 align:start position:0%
resident in
 
01:54:43.669 --> 01:54:43.679 align:start position:0%
our towns in new hampshire and are
 
01:54:46.629 --> 01:54:46.639 align:start position:0%
have clients who are usually from out of
 
01:54:48.709 --> 01:54:48.719 align:start position:0%
state with second homeowners they rent
 
01:54:50.229 --> 01:54:50.239 align:start position:0%
their places
 
01:54:53.350 --> 01:54:53.360 align:start position:0%
on out to people on
 
01:54:57.189 --> 01:54:57.199 align:start position:0%
those facilitators are brick and mortar
 
01:54:59.430 --> 01:54:59.440 align:start position:0%
and they are already collecting and
 
01:55:00.550 --> 01:55:00.560 align:start position:0%
paying this tax
 
01:55:04.629 --> 01:55:04.639 align:start position:0%
to the dra on the dra
 
01:55:08.149 --> 01:55:08.159 align:start position:0%
also goes after people that on a less
 
01:55:12.149 --> 01:55:12.159 align:start position:0%
uh on frequent
 
01:55:15.270 --> 01:55:15.280 align:start position:0%
basis will will rent out a room for
 
01:55:17.510 --> 01:55:17.520 align:start position:0%
instance i had a guy who was quite upset
 
01:55:18.470 --> 01:55:18.480 align:start position:0%
about it who got
 
01:55:21.510 --> 01:55:21.520 align:start position:0%
caught in lebanon because he
 
01:55:23.350 --> 01:55:23.360 align:start position:0%
had decided that he could help pay for
 
01:55:25.350 --> 01:55:25.360 align:start position:0%
his apartment's rent by renting out the
 
01:55:27.750 --> 01:55:27.760 align:start position:0%
back room to visiting nurses
 
01:55:30.229 --> 01:55:30.239 align:start position:0%
and he hadn't realized that he owed a
 
01:55:31.990 --> 01:55:32.000 align:start position:0%
tax on that under our current law
 
01:55:35.510 --> 01:55:35.520 align:start position:0%
he does um and
 
01:55:39.510 --> 01:55:39.520 align:start position:0%
i had to tell him that uh so
 
01:55:43.030 --> 01:55:43.040 align:start position:0%
on this is the situation right now
 
01:55:47.109 --> 01:55:47.119 align:start position:0%
for rooms for cars
 
01:55:51.030 --> 01:55:51.040 align:start position:0%
on the only information that we have
 
01:55:52.149 --> 01:55:52.159 align:start position:0%
found has been
 
01:55:56.189 --> 01:55:56.199 align:start position:0%
very large on remote
 
01:55:59.669 --> 01:55:59.679 align:start position:0%
facilitators who are working
 
01:56:02.950 --> 01:56:02.960 align:start position:0%
nationwide from other states and who
 
01:56:04.149 --> 01:56:04.159 align:start position:0%
have the bandwidth
 
01:56:07.750 --> 01:56:07.760 align:start position:0%
to to uh
 
01:56:10.390 --> 01:56:10.400 align:start position:0%
advertise their product widely over the
 
01:56:10.400 --> 01:56:13.350 align:start position:0%
advertise their product widely over the
websites

01:56:13.350 --> 01:56:13.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:16.629 --> 01:56:16.639 align:start position:0%
and i don't know theoretically a
 
01:56:19.669 --> 01:56:19.679 align:start position:0%
a single small facilitator of that type
 
01:56:19.679 --> 01:56:20.070 align:start position:0%
a single small facilitator of that type
could

01:56:20.070 --> 01:56:20.080 align:start position:0%
could
 
01:56:23.350 --> 01:56:23.360 align:start position:0%
develop in new hampshire
 
01:56:26.629 --> 01:56:26.639 align:start position:0%
but on we haven't heard from anyone
 
01:56:29.830 --> 01:56:29.840 align:start position:0%
that was trying to do that and it does
 
01:56:32.310 --> 01:56:32.320 align:start position:0%
take quite a lot to make yourself
 
01:56:34.310 --> 01:56:34.320 align:start position:0%
nationally known
 
01:56:37.270 --> 01:56:37.280 align:start position:0%
sometimes it requires a certain amount
 
01:56:37.280 --> 01:56:37.830 align:start position:0%
sometimes it requires a certain amount
of

01:56:37.830 --> 01:56:37.840 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:56:42.229 --> 01:56:42.239 align:start position:0%
creativity but and could happen
 
01:56:44.709 --> 01:56:44.719 align:start position:0%
but given that what we are just trying
 
01:56:45.350 --> 01:56:45.360 align:start position:0%
to do
 
01:56:48.550 --> 01:56:48.560 align:start position:0%
is to even the playing field between
 
01:56:52.870 --> 01:56:52.880 align:start position:0%
the the remote sellers that are selling
 
01:56:55.750 --> 01:56:55.760 align:start position:0%
uh a product that is the same in the
 
01:56:55.760 --> 01:56:56.390 align:start position:0%
uh a product that is the same in the
same

01:56:56.390 --> 01:56:56.400 align:start position:0%
same
 
01:56:58.790 --> 01:56:58.800 align:start position:0%
manner as the people that are brick and
 
01:57:00.149 --> 01:57:00.159 align:start position:0%
mortar that are
 
01:57:03.510 --> 01:57:03.520 align:start position:0%
resident within our state and
 
01:57:07.109 --> 01:57:07.119 align:start position:0%
that is not a new tax that is
 
01:57:10.149 --> 01:57:10.159 align:start position:0%
making the tax fairer to
 
01:57:13.510 --> 01:57:13.520 align:start position:0%
to the same businesses and
 
01:57:15.990 --> 01:57:16.000 align:start position:0%
under our constitution and the supreme
 
01:57:16.000 --> 01:57:16.790 align:start position:0%
under our constitution and the supreme
court

01:57:16.790 --> 01:57:16.800 align:start position:0%
court
 
01:57:20.950 --> 01:57:20.960 align:start position:0%
generally decide when you go to them
 
01:57:23.030 --> 01:57:23.040 align:start position:0%
to that effect but we are waiting as i
 
01:57:24.229 --> 01:57:24.239 align:start position:0%
understand for the
 
01:57:25.990 --> 01:57:26.000 align:start position:0%
department of revenue administration to
 
01:57:29.830 --> 01:57:29.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:34.870 --> 01:57:34.880 align:start position:0%
okay representative romney
 
01:57:37.350 --> 01:57:37.360 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um yeah i was on that
 
01:57:37.360 --> 01:57:38.070 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um yeah i was on that
subcommittee

01:57:38.070 --> 01:57:38.080 align:start position:0%
subcommittee
 
01:57:40.629 --> 01:57:40.639 align:start position:0%
with that representative malloy uh
 
01:57:42.310 --> 01:57:42.320 align:start position:0%
chaired last year
 
01:57:43.750 --> 01:57:43.760 align:start position:0%
you know we spent a lot of time on this
 
01:57:45.589 --> 01:57:45.599 align:start position:0%
bill uh trying to get the language
 
01:57:45.599 --> 01:57:46.629 align:start position:0%
bill uh trying to get the language
correct

01:57:46.629 --> 01:57:46.639 align:start position:0%
correct
 
01:57:48.709 --> 01:57:48.719 align:start position:0%
uh we worked with sean thomas who
 
01:57:50.629 --> 01:57:50.639 align:start position:0%
unfortunately is no longer with the dra
 
01:57:51.189 --> 01:57:51.199 align:start position:0%
but he
 
01:57:53.350 --> 01:57:53.360 align:start position:0%
he's a lawyer who who wrote most of this
 
01:57:53.360 --> 01:57:54.310 align:start position:0%
he's a lawyer who who wrote most of this
language

01:57:54.310 --> 01:57:54.320 align:start position:0%
language
 
01:57:55.830 --> 01:57:55.840 align:start position:0%
and we went through a whole bunch of
 
01:57:57.430 --> 01:57:57.440 align:start position:0%
iterations on it
 
01:58:00.550 --> 01:58:00.560 align:start position:0%
uh but philosophically uh
 
01:58:01.910 --> 01:58:01.920 align:start position:0%
yes and there's some questions in our
 
01:58:03.990 --> 01:58:04.000 align:start position:0%
caucus about the language and that's why
 
01:58:06.550 --> 01:58:06.560 align:start position:0%
we we do want to hear uh not for me but
 
01:58:08.310 --> 01:58:08.320 align:start position:0%
from other members of our caucus
 
01:58:10.950 --> 01:58:10.960 align:start position:0%
that we we want to hear from dra i think
 
01:58:11.430 --> 01:58:11.440 align:start position:0%
we'll get
 
01:58:14.390 --> 01:58:14.400 align:start position:0%
satisfaction once we hear from dra on on
 
01:58:16.470 --> 01:58:16.480 align:start position:0%
some of the meaning of certain things
 
01:58:18.790 --> 01:58:18.800 align:start position:0%
but it is i mean we're not talking mom
 
01:58:19.589 --> 01:58:19.599 align:start position:0%
and pop here
 
01:58:21.990 --> 01:58:22.000 align:start position:0%
uh maybe you know we're talking airbnb
 
01:58:22.790 --> 01:58:22.800 align:start position:0%
we're talking
 
01:58:25.830 --> 01:58:25.840 align:start position:0%
on the on the uh room side and toro
 
01:58:27.430 --> 01:58:27.440 align:start position:0%
who's getting bigger by the day on the
 
01:58:28.870 --> 01:58:28.880 align:start position:0%
auto side
 
01:58:31.510 --> 01:58:31.520 align:start position:0%
and it's it we view this and we view it
 
01:58:32.390 --> 01:58:32.400 align:start position:0%
last year as a
 
01:58:35.430 --> 01:58:35.440 align:start position:0%
committee as a fairness issue uh
 
01:58:37.990 --> 01:58:38.000 align:start position:0%
between the brick and mortar and the you
 
01:58:39.910 --> 01:58:39.920 align:start position:0%
know hey we're in the
 
01:58:42.310 --> 01:58:42.320 align:start position:0%
you know 21st century now with all these
 
01:58:43.990 --> 01:58:44.000 align:start position:0%
platforms that are out there
 
01:58:46.950 --> 01:58:46.960 align:start position:0%
uh we felt that was appropriate to tax
 
01:58:48.149 --> 01:58:48.159 align:start position:0%
and all the facilitator does the
 
01:58:49.430 --> 01:58:49.440 align:start position:0%
facilitator is not being taxed the
 
01:58:49.440 --> 01:58:50.310 align:start position:0%
facilitator is not being taxed the
facilitator

01:58:50.310 --> 01:58:50.320 align:start position:0%
facilitator
 
01:58:54.229 --> 01:58:54.239 align:start position:0%
is making sure that the person uh
 
01:58:56.149 --> 01:58:56.159 align:start position:0%
renting the car from another individual
 
01:58:58.390 --> 01:58:58.400 align:start position:0%
or renting the room for another original
 
01:59:02.070 --> 01:59:02.080 align:start position:0%
uh tax on the the uh rumor males
 
01:59:04.950 --> 01:59:04.960 align:start position:0%
uh about the reveals the the uh the yeah
 
01:59:06.310 --> 01:59:06.320 align:start position:0%
room mail tax
 
01:59:09.350 --> 01:59:09.360 align:start position:0%
which is the uh uh and
 
01:59:11.510 --> 01:59:11.520 align:start position:0%
and the five percent and collects that
 
01:59:13.750 --> 01:59:13.760 align:start position:0%
his job is to collect that not tax him
 
01:59:15.990 --> 01:59:16.000 align:start position:0%
because we're actually taxing a person
 
01:59:17.430 --> 01:59:17.440 align:start position:0%
who rents the room
 
01:59:21.270 --> 01:59:21.280 align:start position:0%
and rents the car uh
 
01:59:22.709 --> 01:59:22.719 align:start position:0%
instead of from a brick and mortar
 
01:59:25.030 --> 01:59:25.040 align:start position:0%
operation from uh from an e
 
01:59:28.310 --> 01:59:28.320 align:start position:0%
e-commerce operation and uh so
 
01:59:30.310 --> 01:59:30.320 align:start position:0%
that just i just wanted to say those
 
01:59:31.669 --> 01:59:31.679 align:start position:0%
things and uh we'll see
 
01:59:33.990 --> 01:59:34.000 align:start position:0%
what happens tomorrow when we we have
 
01:59:37.109 --> 01:59:37.119 align:start position:0%
dras input thank you
 
01:59:40.629 --> 01:59:40.639 align:start position:0%
doctor ms spillsbury thank you mr
 
01:59:40.639 --> 01:59:41.830 align:start position:0%
doctor ms spillsbury thank you mr
chairman

01:59:41.830 --> 01:59:41.840 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
01:59:44.790 --> 01:59:44.800 align:start position:0%
i've had no involvement in this bill my
 
01:59:47.030 --> 01:59:47.040 align:start position:0%
exposure to it is purely in the work of
 
01:59:48.470 --> 01:59:48.480 align:start position:0%
this committee in the last couple of
 
01:59:48.480 --> 01:59:49.830 align:start position:0%
this committee in the last couple of
weeks

01:59:49.830 --> 01:59:49.840 align:start position:0%
weeks
 
01:59:51.910 --> 01:59:51.920 align:start position:0%
and in reading the language i don't find
 
01:59:51.920 --> 01:59:53.030 align:start position:0%
and in reading the language i don't find
anything

01:59:53.030 --> 01:59:53.040 align:start position:0%
anything
 
01:59:56.950 --> 01:59:56.960 align:start position:0%
to be ambiguous or controversial
 
01:59:59.109 --> 01:59:59.119 align:start position:0%
about this bill i think the bill is
 
02:00:01.589 --> 02:00:01.599 align:start position:0%
plainly and well written
 
02:00:04.790 --> 02:00:04.800 align:start position:0%
i view it from a marketing perspective
 
02:00:07.910 --> 02:00:07.920 align:start position:0%
the product hasn't changed what's
 
02:00:07.920 --> 02:00:08.629 align:start position:0%
the product hasn't changed what's
happened

02:00:08.629 --> 02:00:08.639 align:start position:0%
happened
 
02:00:11.830 --> 02:00:11.840 align:start position:0%
is a new channel of
 
02:00:14.629 --> 02:00:14.639 align:start position:0%
has been introduced and that channel of
 
02:00:14.639 --> 02:00:15.669 align:start position:0%
has been introduced and that channel of
distribution

02:00:15.669 --> 02:00:15.679 align:start position:0%
distribution
 
02:00:18.870 --> 02:00:18.880 align:start position:0%
is simply a new innovation
 
02:00:23.109 --> 02:00:23.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:25.830 --> 02:00:25.840 align:start position:0%
just simply a a different form of
 
02:00:27.830 --> 02:00:27.840 align:start position:0%
booking agent
 
02:00:30.629 --> 02:00:30.639 align:start position:0%
so i would grant some of what
 
02:00:32.870 --> 02:00:32.880 align:start position:0%
representative schaumburg said
 
02:00:35.270 --> 02:00:35.280 align:start position:0%
the definition of operator has been
 
02:00:35.280 --> 02:00:36.629 align:start position:0%
the definition of operator has been
expanded

02:00:36.629 --> 02:00:36.639 align:start position:0%
expanded
 
02:00:40.790 --> 02:00:40.800 align:start position:0%
to include these new innovative entities
 
02:00:43.350 --> 02:00:43.360 align:start position:0%
um and so we have rental facilitator and
 
02:00:46.149 --> 02:00:46.159 align:start position:0%
room facilitator they're both defined
 
02:00:48.149 --> 02:00:48.159 align:start position:0%
and they're defined very much in
 
02:00:48.159 --> 02:00:49.750 align:start position:0%
and they're defined very much in
parallel

02:00:49.750 --> 02:00:49.760 align:start position:0%
parallel
 
02:00:54.629 --> 02:00:54.639 align:start position:0%
if you look at line 25
 
02:00:59.030 --> 02:00:59.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:02.629 --> 02:01:02.639 align:start position:0%
the subject that's being
 
02:01:05.830 --> 02:01:05.840 align:start position:0%
or product that's being taxed
 
02:01:08.870 --> 02:01:08.880 align:start position:0%
is quote rental of a motor vehicle to a
 
02:01:08.880 --> 02:01:11.189 align:start position:0%
is quote rental of a motor vehicle to a
renter

02:01:11.189 --> 02:01:11.199 align:start position:0%
renter
 
02:01:14.470 --> 02:01:14.480 align:start position:0%
all of the words that come before that
 
02:01:18.390 --> 02:01:18.400 align:start position:0%
are just descriptors of a variety of
 
02:01:21.990 --> 02:01:22.000 align:start position:0%
marketing agents so
 
02:01:24.790 --> 02:01:24.800 align:start position:0%
rel facility means any person having any
 
02:01:24.800 --> 02:01:25.589 align:start position:0%
rel facility means any person having any
right

02:01:25.589 --> 02:01:25.599 align:start position:0%
right
 
02:01:28.790 --> 02:01:28.800 align:start position:0%

02:01:31.109 --> 02:01:31.119 align:start position:0%

02:01:33.350 --> 02:01:33.360 align:start position:0%

02:01:35.669 --> 02:01:35.679 align:start position:0%
coordinate or otherwise facilitate
 
02:01:40.070 --> 02:01:40.080 align:start position:0%
what rental of a motor vehicle
 
02:01:43.350 --> 02:01:43.360 align:start position:0%
to a renter rent rental
 
02:01:46.470 --> 02:01:46.480 align:start position:0%
of a motor vehicle to a renter is the
 
02:01:46.480 --> 02:01:47.189 align:start position:0%
of a motor vehicle to a renter is the
product

02:01:47.189 --> 02:01:47.199 align:start position:0%
product
 
02:01:50.229 --> 02:01:50.239 align:start position:0%
it hasn't changed the exact
 
02:01:53.750 --> 02:01:53.760 align:start position:0%
same structure occurs in the definition
 
02:01:55.189 --> 02:01:55.199 align:start position:0%
of room facilitator and
 
02:02:00.070 --> 02:02:00.080 align:start position:0%
page two in line three what's being text
 
02:02:04.149 --> 02:02:04.159 align:start position:0%
occupancy to an occupant the addition
 
02:02:07.109 --> 02:02:07.119 align:start position:0%
of someone facilitating doesn't change
 
02:02:07.119 --> 02:02:07.830 align:start position:0%
of someone facilitating doesn't change
that

02:02:07.830 --> 02:02:07.840 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:02:10.709 --> 02:02:10.719 align:start position:0%
so it's not a new tax and as
 
02:02:10.719 --> 02:02:11.430 align:start position:0%
so it's not a new tax and as
representative

02:02:11.430 --> 02:02:11.440 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:02:15.510 --> 02:02:15.520 align:start position:0%
raleigh just said the person being taxed
 
02:02:17.589 --> 02:02:17.599 align:start position:0%
is the person who's renting the room or
 
02:02:18.950 --> 02:02:18.960 align:start position:0%
the car
 
02:02:21.030 --> 02:02:21.040 align:start position:0%
all we're asking the facilitator to do
 
02:02:23.270 --> 02:02:23.280 align:start position:0%
is be responsible for collecting it
 
02:02:27.189 --> 02:02:27.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:29.669 --> 02:02:29.679 align:start position:0%
that's all thank you representative
 
02:02:34.870 --> 02:02:34.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:37.990 --> 02:02:38.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um
 
02:02:39.669 --> 02:02:39.679 align:start position:0%
yeah on on this bill i agree with
 
02:02:41.669 --> 02:02:41.679 align:start position:0%
representative almi and as abram
 
02:02:43.189 --> 02:02:43.199 align:start position:0%
others have said about the issue of
 
02:02:46.390 --> 02:02:46.400 align:start position:0%
fairness uh the market's changing and
 
02:02:49.109 --> 02:02:49.119 align:start position:0%
a pro growth and just a fair policy is
 
02:02:50.390 --> 02:02:50.400 align:start position:0%
applying attacks
 
02:02:53.430 --> 02:02:53.440 align:start position:0%
equally to different businesses of the
 
02:02:53.440 --> 02:02:54.070 align:start position:0%
equally to different businesses of the
same

02:02:54.070 --> 02:02:54.080 align:start position:0%
same
 
02:02:57.350 --> 02:02:57.360 align:start position:0%
tax um so this bill is not intended to
 
02:02:58.870 --> 02:02:58.880 align:start position:0%
create a new tax
 
02:03:01.589 --> 02:03:01.599 align:start position:0%
um i do think there's there's a concern
 
02:03:03.589 --> 02:03:03.599 align:start position:0%
about this potentially applying to
 
02:03:05.910 --> 02:03:05.920 align:start position:0%
travel agents as it's written which i
 
02:03:07.990 --> 02:03:08.000 align:start position:0%
know is not the intent of anyone
 
02:03:11.189 --> 02:03:11.199 align:start position:0%
so i think literally just a one sentence
 
02:03:13.510 --> 02:03:13.520 align:start position:0%
amendment in there saying this shall not
 
02:03:15.189 --> 02:03:15.199 align:start position:0%
apply to travel agents would be
 
02:03:15.199 --> 02:03:15.990 align:start position:0%
apply to travel agents would be
important

02:03:15.990 --> 02:03:16.000 align:start position:0%
important
 
02:03:17.750 --> 02:03:17.760 align:start position:0%
and i think that's why it's important to
 
02:03:19.270 --> 02:03:19.280 align:start position:0%
continue to tweak this
 
02:03:22.550 --> 02:03:22.560 align:start position:0%
but i think the bill is pretty close um
 
02:03:25.030 --> 02:03:25.040 align:start position:0%
so you know hopefully we can tweak it um
 
02:03:25.990 --> 02:03:26.000 align:start position:0%
and then
 
02:03:27.669 --> 02:03:27.679 align:start position:0%
um there sounds like there's a wide
 
02:03:29.430 --> 02:03:29.440 align:start position:0%
amount of support um
 
02:03:31.189 --> 02:03:31.199 align:start position:0%
among the committee and then we can get
 
02:03:34.229 --> 02:03:34.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:37.030 --> 02:03:37.040 align:start position:0%
thank you representative baxter uh
 
02:03:39.189 --> 02:03:39.199 align:start position:0%
representative salesforce
 
02:03:41.990 --> 02:03:42.000 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chairman just briefly i
 
02:03:44.149 --> 02:03:44.159 align:start position:0%
support this bill for two reasons
 
02:03:46.629 --> 02:03:46.639 align:start position:0%
uh first i really think the idea of
 
02:03:48.310 --> 02:03:48.320 align:start position:0%
fairness is very important
 
02:03:51.189 --> 02:03:51.199 align:start position:0%
and secondly for those who aren't there
 
02:03:53.910 --> 02:03:53.920 align:start position:0%
our subcommittee did a very thorough
 
02:03:57.109 --> 02:03:57.119 align:start position:0%
job researching this bill and so i think
 
02:03:59.109 --> 02:03:59.119 align:start position:0%
what we came up with was just based
 
02:04:08.830 --> 02:04:08.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:08.840 --> 02:04:11.189 align:start position:0%
 
representative

02:04:11.189 --> 02:04:11.199 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:04:14.550 --> 02:04:14.560 align:start position:0%
thank you can you hear me yes
 
02:04:17.669 --> 02:04:17.679 align:start position:0%
oh good on i just wanted to suggest we
 
02:04:19.589 --> 02:04:19.599 align:start position:0%
add the travel agent question
 
02:04:23.350 --> 02:04:23.360 align:start position:0%
to the dras list
 
02:04:26.069 --> 02:04:26.079 align:start position:0%
yeah because on i was under the
 
02:04:26.079 --> 02:04:26.950 align:start position:0%
yeah because on i was under the
impression

02:04:26.950 --> 02:04:26.960 align:start position:0%
impression
 
02:04:29.910 --> 02:04:29.920 align:start position:0%
on that if it's a room that they would
 
02:04:31.430 --> 02:04:31.440 align:start position:0%
pay i'm not sure
 
02:04:33.750 --> 02:04:33.760 align:start position:0%
on and i presume i mean they don't pay
 
02:04:34.950 --> 02:04:34.960 align:start position:0%
they collect and
 
02:04:37.350 --> 02:04:37.360 align:start position:0%
send it on and that the same thing would
 
02:04:39.189 --> 02:04:39.199 align:start position:0%
apply to cars
 
02:04:43.589 --> 02:04:43.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:46.629 --> 02:04:46.639 align:start position:0%
any other comments uh
 
02:04:50.870 --> 02:04:50.880 align:start position:0%
well representative romney has a hand up
 
02:04:52.390 --> 02:04:52.400 align:start position:0%
yeah i'm just trying to figure out where
 
02:04:54.470 --> 02:04:54.480 align:start position:0%
a travel agent fits in in this whole
 
02:04:57.910 --> 02:04:57.920 align:start position:0%
discussion i guess a travel agent
 
02:05:00.310 --> 02:05:00.320 align:start position:0%
if if someone said they wanted uh to go
 
02:05:01.350 --> 02:05:01.360 align:start position:0%
to their truck let's say they have a
 
02:05:03.189 --> 02:05:03.199 align:start position:0%
travel agent they use all the time
 
02:05:06.629 --> 02:05:06.639 align:start position:0%
and they said they wanted to rent a room
 
02:05:09.589 --> 02:05:09.599 align:start position:0%
through airbnb all the travel agent
 
02:05:10.950 --> 02:05:10.960 align:start position:0%
would do
 
02:05:12.950 --> 02:05:12.960 align:start position:0%
i would imagine i'm guessing here would
 
02:05:14.229 --> 02:05:14.239 align:start position:0%
be to contact
 
02:05:17.350 --> 02:05:17.360 align:start position:0%
airbnb which is the platform the
 
02:05:17.360 --> 02:05:18.629 align:start position:0%
airbnb which is the platform the
middleman

02:05:18.629 --> 02:05:18.639 align:start position:0%
middleman
 
02:05:21.750 --> 02:05:21.760 align:start position:0%
to in turn find a room for them
 
02:05:25.669 --> 02:05:25.679 align:start position:0%
to to rent uh so or you know or a house
 
02:05:27.189 --> 02:05:27.199 align:start position:0%
or whatever it might be
 
02:05:29.589 --> 02:05:29.599 align:start position:0%
so i'm not quite sure and then there we
 
02:05:31.030 --> 02:05:31.040 align:start position:0%
have a different financial relationship
 
02:05:33.270 --> 02:05:33.280 align:start position:0%
between the travel agent
 
02:05:35.830 --> 02:05:35.840 align:start position:0%
and the facilitator or air b in this
 
02:05:38.069 --> 02:05:38.079 align:start position:0%
case airbnb
 
02:05:41.830 --> 02:05:41.840 align:start position:0%
and i i don't see where in this language
 
02:05:44.629 --> 02:05:44.639 align:start position:0%
there'd be attacks on it but we can ask
 
02:05:45.030 --> 02:05:45.040 align:start position:0%
you know
 
02:05:46.310 --> 02:05:46.320 align:start position:0%
that's a good question representative
 
02:05:46.320 --> 02:05:48.149 align:start position:0%
that's a good question representative
baxter

02:05:48.149 --> 02:05:48.159 align:start position:0%
baxter
 
02:05:50.870 --> 02:05:50.880 align:start position:0%
let's clarify it and put it to bed once
 
02:05:51.589 --> 02:05:51.599 align:start position:0%
and for all
 
02:05:56.709 --> 02:05:56.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:00.550 --> 02:06:00.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:02.390 --> 02:06:02.400 align:start position:0%
i think the question on travel agency
 
02:06:04.709 --> 02:06:04.719 align:start position:0%
comes in on line 15 of the first page of
 
02:06:05.589 --> 02:06:05.599 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
02:06:08.870 --> 02:06:08.880 align:start position:0%
where it where it basically says um
 
02:06:10.629 --> 02:06:10.639 align:start position:0%
arkansas without any deduction of any
 
02:06:12.870 --> 02:06:12.880 align:start position:0%
account including any fees service or
 
02:06:15.109 --> 02:06:15.119 align:start position:0%
other charge required to be paid by
 
02:06:18.149 --> 02:06:18.159 align:start position:0%
by the occupancy of a room facilitator i
 
02:06:18.629 --> 02:06:18.639 align:start position:0%
think the
 
02:06:20.790 --> 02:06:20.800 align:start position:0%
travel agency's concern is that their
 
02:06:22.229 --> 02:06:22.239 align:start position:0%
service fee
 
02:06:24.629 --> 02:06:24.639 align:start position:0%
that they tack on to make money is being
 
02:06:24.639 --> 02:06:25.750 align:start position:0%
that they tack on to make money is being
taxed

02:06:25.750 --> 02:06:25.760 align:start position:0%
taxed
 
02:06:32.390 --> 02:06:32.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:38.629 --> 02:06:38.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:40.550 --> 02:06:40.560 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman i i think what was
 
02:06:41.830 --> 02:06:41.840 align:start position:0%
just said is
 
02:06:45.830 --> 02:06:45.840 align:start position:0%
accurate but not the point
 
02:06:48.069 --> 02:06:48.079 align:start position:0%
a fee that's tacked on as a booking fee
 
02:06:49.830 --> 02:06:49.840 align:start position:0%
it's a marketing expense is part of the
 
02:06:51.669 --> 02:06:51.679 align:start position:0%
process and the total cost of selling
 
02:07:00.229 --> 02:07:00.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:03.830 --> 02:07:03.840 align:start position:0%
representative bernstein thank you mr
 
02:07:03.840 --> 02:07:04.709 align:start position:0%
representative bernstein thank you mr
chair

02:07:04.709 --> 02:07:04.719 align:start position:0%
chair
 
02:07:07.589 --> 02:07:07.599 align:start position:0%
um i too was on the committee last term
 
02:07:09.510 --> 02:07:09.520 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee that looked at this
 
02:07:12.229 --> 02:07:12.239 align:start position:0%
bill and i have the bill pulled up on my
 
02:07:13.030 --> 02:07:13.040 align:start position:0%
screen it was
 
02:07:18.790 --> 02:07:18.800 align:start position:0%
um hb 1558 from 2019
 
02:07:22.390 --> 02:07:22.400 align:start position:0%
and the current iteration of this bill
 
02:07:24.310 --> 02:07:24.320 align:start position:0%
expands the scope of the bill and that
 
02:07:26.149 --> 02:07:26.159 align:start position:0%
that's why i'm just not
 
02:07:28.069 --> 02:07:28.079 align:start position:0%
i'm i still haven't rendered a final
 
02:07:29.830 --> 02:07:29.840 align:start position:0%
decision on how i'm going to vote
 
02:07:32.470 --> 02:07:32.480 align:start position:0%
i just have some concerns that this this
 
02:07:34.790 --> 02:07:34.800 align:start position:0%
bill is much more inclusive
 
02:07:38.149 --> 02:07:38.159 align:start position:0%
than the 19 line bill we we looked at
 
02:07:39.510 --> 02:07:39.520 align:start position:0%
two years ago
 
02:07:42.709 --> 02:07:42.719 align:start position:0%
um two years ago there was no mention
 
02:07:45.830 --> 02:07:45.840 align:start position:0%
of taxing fees or services
 
02:07:48.709 --> 02:07:48.719 align:start position:0%
it was simply a question of fairness
 
02:07:48.719 --> 02:07:49.430 align:start position:0%
it was simply a question of fairness
between

02:07:49.430 --> 02:07:49.440 align:start position:0%
between
 
02:07:52.709 --> 02:07:52.719 align:start position:0%
uh the platform that toro
 
02:07:55.270 --> 02:07:55.280 align:start position:0%
is operating on as compared to rental
 
02:07:56.550 --> 02:07:56.560 align:start position:0%
car agencies
 
02:07:58.390 --> 02:07:58.400 align:start position:0%
but now all of a sudden there's new
 
02:08:00.470 --> 02:08:00.480 align:start position:0%
language regarding fees and services and
 
02:08:02.470 --> 02:08:02.480 align:start position:0%
i'm reluctant to support it because
 
02:08:05.830 --> 02:08:05.840 align:start position:0%
i i think that perhaps we're
 
02:08:09.270 --> 02:08:09.280 align:start position:0%
casting too wide of net uh i will i
 
02:08:11.510 --> 02:08:11.520 align:start position:0%
i i'm looking forward to hearing from
 
02:08:11.520 --> 02:08:12.709 align:start position:0%
i i'm looking forward to hearing from
dra

02:08:12.709 --> 02:08:12.719 align:start position:0%
dra
 
02:08:14.310 --> 02:08:14.320 align:start position:0%
so we can get some interpretation of
 
02:08:16.229 --> 02:08:16.239 align:start position:0%
some of this language but
 
02:08:18.790 --> 02:08:18.800 align:start position:0%
um this is not the bill we looked at two
 
02:08:20.149 --> 02:08:20.159 align:start position:0%
years ago
 
02:08:23.189 --> 02:08:23.199 align:start position:0%
representative romney jump in
 
02:08:24.629 --> 02:08:24.639 align:start position:0%
when you when you pull that up did you
 
02:08:26.629 --> 02:08:26.639 align:start position:0%
pull up the original
 
02:08:27.830 --> 02:08:27.840 align:start position:0%
you got to make sure when you're looking
 
02:08:29.430 --> 02:08:29.440 align:start position:0%
at the bill it should be the bill that
 
02:08:29.910 --> 02:08:29.920 align:start position:0%
that we
 
02:08:33.910 --> 02:08:33.920 align:start position:0%
we voted on at the end not as introduced
 
02:08:35.350 --> 02:08:35.360 align:start position:0%
we did a lot of amending to the bill
 
02:08:36.629 --> 02:08:36.639 align:start position:0%
that went to the floor that we all
 
02:08:38.069 --> 02:08:38.079 align:start position:0%
passed so can you please double check
 
02:08:38.079 --> 02:08:38.629 align:start position:0%
passed so can you please double check
that

02:08:38.629 --> 02:08:38.639 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:08:40.709 --> 02:08:40.719 align:start position:0%
i i'm looking at the original bill and
 
02:08:42.709 --> 02:08:42.719 align:start position:0%
you're correct uh representative abrami
 
02:08:44.229 --> 02:08:44.239 align:start position:0%
and i will pull out the
 
02:08:46.550 --> 02:08:46.560 align:start position:0%
version we voted on thank you thank you
 
02:08:46.560 --> 02:08:47.350 align:start position:0%
version we voted on thank you thank you
okay

02:08:47.350 --> 02:08:47.360 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:08:50.870 --> 02:08:50.880 align:start position:0%
ruxin i don't see any of the
 
02:08:54.390 --> 02:08:54.400 align:start position:0%
hands so
 
02:08:57.189 --> 02:08:57.199 align:start position:0%
looks like we can move on and bring this
 
02:08:58.470 --> 02:08:58.480 align:start position:0%
up again tomorrow
 
02:09:01.589 --> 02:09:01.599 align:start position:0%
and hopefully we get the bra
 
02:09:10.069 --> 02:09:10.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:14.069 --> 02:09:14.079 align:start position:0%
the next is i'm going to skip over 210
 
02:09:17.430 --> 02:09:17.440 align:start position:0%
but go to house bill 306
 
02:09:28.870 --> 02:09:28.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:31.030 --> 02:09:31.040 align:start position:0%
relative to the revenue estimates while
 
02:09:33.270 --> 02:09:33.280 align:start position:0%
operating under emergency orders caused
 
02:09:33.280 --> 02:09:33.669 align:start position:0%
operating under emergency orders caused
by

02:09:33.669 --> 02:09:33.679 align:start position:0%
by
 
02:09:44.709 --> 02:09:44.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:47.910 --> 02:09:47.920 align:start position:0%
and susan you had some
 
02:09:54.629 --> 02:09:54.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:57.990 --> 02:09:58.000 align:start position:0%
yes on we were worried
 
02:10:00.069 --> 02:10:00.079 align:start position:0%
and i was particularly worried haven't
 
02:10:02.229 --> 02:10:02.239 align:start position:0%
had to deal with this for a long time
 
02:10:05.910 --> 02:10:05.920 align:start position:0%
that on this is our normal practice
 
02:10:08.550 --> 02:10:08.560 align:start position:0%
at this point that when the economy is
 
02:10:08.560 --> 02:10:09.750 align:start position:0%
at this point that when the economy is
shifting

02:10:09.750 --> 02:10:09.760 align:start position:0%
shifting
 
02:10:13.189 --> 02:10:13.199 align:start position:0%
we do revenue estimates more often
 
02:10:15.750 --> 02:10:15.760 align:start position:0%
and we both of us have had trouble
 
02:10:15.760 --> 02:10:16.390 align:start position:0%
and we both of us have had trouble
getting

02:10:16.390 --> 02:10:16.400 align:start position:0%
getting
 
02:10:20.470 --> 02:10:20.480 align:start position:0%
agencies at some points to uh cooperate
 
02:10:23.350 --> 02:10:23.360 align:start position:0%
with that and so i understand your
 
02:10:23.360 --> 02:10:23.910 align:start position:0%
with that and so i understand your
intent

02:10:23.910 --> 02:10:23.920 align:start position:0%
intent
 
02:10:27.030 --> 02:10:27.040 align:start position:0%
in doing this but in limiting it
 
02:10:30.870 --> 02:10:30.880 align:start position:0%
to just the emergency executive orders
 
02:10:35.589 --> 02:10:35.599 align:start position:0%
under covid and the fiscal years 21-23
 
02:10:38.870 --> 02:10:38.880 align:start position:0%
we are sending a signal that we are no
 
02:10:38.880 --> 02:10:39.589 align:start position:0%
we are sending a signal that we are no
longer

02:10:39.589 --> 02:10:39.599 align:start position:0%
longer
 
02:10:42.870 --> 02:10:42.880 align:start position:0%
when we need to do so going to be able
 
02:10:44.629 --> 02:10:44.639 align:start position:0%
to tell the agencies look
 
02:10:48.229 --> 02:10:48.239 align:start position:0%
we have to to do these revenue estimates
 
02:10:50.550 --> 02:10:50.560 align:start position:0%
on a more frequent basis
 
02:10:54.870 --> 02:10:54.880 align:start position:0%
and so on i wanted to suggest
 
02:10:58.470 --> 02:10:58.480 align:start position:0%
that on you
 
02:11:01.589 --> 02:11:01.599 align:start position:0%
take out everything amended and take out
 
02:11:02.790 --> 02:11:02.800 align:start position:0%
everything relevant
 
02:11:06.550 --> 02:11:06.560 align:start position:0%
to the fiscal years 21 23 and decoded
 
02:11:09.589 --> 02:11:09.599 align:start position:0%
pandemic and
 
02:11:12.870 --> 02:11:12.880 align:start position:0%
emergency maybe even emergency orders
 
02:11:15.910 --> 02:11:15.920 align:start position:0%
because we have quite frequently had
 
02:11:18.950 --> 02:11:18.960 align:start position:0%
had shaky economies at the same time
 
02:11:21.990 --> 02:11:22.000 align:start position:0%
without emergency orders being used
 
02:11:23.910 --> 02:11:23.920 align:start position:0%
in fact these are the first emergency
 
02:11:25.510 --> 02:11:25.520 align:start position:0%
orders since the bill
 
02:11:29.310 --> 02:11:29.320 align:start position:0%
put them in i think in our first year in
 
02:11:29.320 --> 02:11:31.990 align:start position:0%
put them in i think in our first year in
1996.

02:11:31.990 --> 02:11:32.000 align:start position:0%
1996.
 
02:11:35.189 --> 02:11:35.199 align:start position:0%
do you have a language that
 
02:11:38.470 --> 02:11:38.480 align:start position:0%
you would recommend but a
 
02:11:40.629 --> 02:11:40.639 align:start position:0%
but i could write it in five minutes
 
02:11:42.229 --> 02:11:42.239 align:start position:0%
after we finish
 
02:11:43.910 --> 02:11:43.920 align:start position:0%
that'll be fine and we can bring it up
 
02:11:45.510 --> 02:11:45.520 align:start position:0%
tomorrow okay
 
02:11:54.629 --> 02:11:54.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:57.790 --> 02:11:57.800 align:start position:0%
the next is house bill
 
02:12:01.589 --> 02:12:01.599 align:start position:0%
330. my hand was up
 
02:12:05.109 --> 02:12:05.119 align:start position:0%
my hand was up on the last bill on 306
 
02:12:08.470 --> 02:12:08.480 align:start position:0%
yep okay go ahead real quick uh
 
02:12:12.069 --> 02:12:12.079 align:start position:0%
represent army i agree 100 to broaden it
 
02:12:14.550 --> 02:12:14.560 align:start position:0%
and uh do we think we can get an
 
02:12:15.990 --> 02:12:16.000 align:start position:0%
amendment by tomorrow
 
02:12:17.830 --> 02:12:17.840 align:start position:0%
i don't know how quick they work over no
 
02:12:19.589 --> 02:12:19.599 align:start position:0%
oh us
 
02:12:23.589 --> 02:12:23.599 align:start position:0%
these days i know i'm
 
02:12:28.149 --> 02:12:28.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:30.790 --> 02:12:30.800 align:start position:0%
i think by the end of today when i sent
 
02:12:32.550 --> 02:12:32.560 align:start position:0%
to them late last night
 
02:12:35.750 --> 02:12:35.760 align:start position:0%
on another bill okay so i
 
02:12:37.830 --> 02:12:37.840 align:start position:0%
i think something like this that was
 
02:12:39.430 --> 02:12:39.440 align:start position:0%
also a very simple thing and
 
02:12:42.229 --> 02:12:42.239 align:start position:0%
we'll be getting to it i think okay
 
02:12:43.030 --> 02:12:43.040 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:12:43.040 --> 02:12:47.030 align:start position:0%
thank you
okay

02:12:47.030 --> 02:12:47.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:52.709 --> 02:12:52.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:00.830 --> 02:13:00.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:00.840 --> 02:13:05.910 align:start position:0%
 
locations

02:13:05.910 --> 02:13:05.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:05.920 --> 02:13:06.700 align:start position:0%
 
discussion

02:13:06.700 --> 02:13:06.710 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
02:13:06.710 --> 02:13:11.350 align:start position:0%
discussion
[Music]

02:13:11.350 --> 02:13:11.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:11.360 --> 02:13:14.950 align:start position:0%
 
representative

02:13:14.950 --> 02:13:14.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:18.229 --> 02:13:18.239 align:start position:0%
thank you on this
 
02:13:20.629 --> 02:13:20.639 align:start position:0%
is the other bill that i was talking
 
02:13:20.639 --> 02:13:21.350 align:start position:0%
is the other bill that i was talking
about

02:13:21.350 --> 02:13:21.360 align:start position:0%
about
 
02:13:25.910 --> 02:13:25.920 align:start position:0%
on we had on felt strongly
 
02:13:28.229 --> 02:13:28.239 align:start position:0%
on our side on we had agreed with
 
02:13:30.310 --> 02:13:30.320 align:start position:0%
representative abrami that
 
02:13:32.950 --> 02:13:32.960 align:start position:0%
the cap should not be lifted at this
 
02:13:32.960 --> 02:13:34.709 align:start position:0%
the cap should not be lifted at this
point

02:13:34.709 --> 02:13:34.719 align:start position:0%
point
 
02:13:38.390 --> 02:13:38.400 align:start position:0%
and so i sent for an amendment
 
02:13:42.229 --> 02:13:42.239 align:start position:0%
which would allow tier two sports wagers
 
02:13:43.350 --> 02:13:43.360 align:start position:0%
to go forward
 
02:13:48.149 --> 02:13:48.159 align:start position:0%
but avoid removing the cap
 
02:13:51.589 --> 02:13:51.599 align:start position:0%
okay and i think we just we discussed
 
02:13:55.030 --> 02:13:55.040 align:start position:0%
that uh before when we were
 
02:13:58.470 --> 02:13:58.480 align:start position:0%
hearing the bill about the importance
 
02:14:05.510 --> 02:14:05.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:07.830 --> 02:14:07.840 align:start position:0%
so you're going to have an amendment
 
02:14:07.840 --> 02:14:10.310 align:start position:0%
so you're going to have an amendment
that

02:14:10.310 --> 02:14:10.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:13.270 --> 02:14:13.280 align:start position:0%
yes yes it's already being done in the
 
02:14:13.280 --> 02:14:14.390 align:start position:0%
yes yes it's already being done in the
ols

02:14:14.390 --> 02:14:14.400 align:start position:0%
ols
 
02:14:17.750 --> 02:14:17.760 align:start position:0%
okay representative
 
02:14:21.270 --> 02:14:21.280 align:start position:0%
something to say yes uh
 
02:14:24.950 --> 02:14:24.960 align:start position:0%
i'm glad to hear that uh we all have a
 
02:14:27.109 --> 02:14:27.119 align:start position:0%
an understanding of the tier 2 system
 
02:14:29.350 --> 02:14:29.360 align:start position:0%
where you know we've got these two brick
 
02:14:30.709 --> 02:14:30.719 align:start position:0%
and mortar
 
02:14:33.750 --> 02:14:33.760 align:start position:0%
uh facilities and people apparently that
 
02:14:35.030 --> 02:14:35.040 align:start position:0%
go there to
 
02:14:37.030 --> 02:14:37.040 align:start position:0%
do some sports wagering or have dinner
 
02:14:38.629 --> 02:14:38.639 align:start position:0%
or whatever have to go on their mobile
 
02:14:40.310 --> 02:14:40.320 align:start position:0%
devices to uh
 
02:14:42.149 --> 02:14:42.159 align:start position:0%
to make bets that they can't make at the
 
02:14:43.750 --> 02:14:43.760 align:start position:0%
brick and mortar places
 
02:14:46.870 --> 02:14:46.880 align:start position:0%
along the lines of the uh expansion of
 
02:14:46.880 --> 02:14:47.990 align:start position:0%
along the lines of the uh expansion of
uh

02:14:47.990 --> 02:14:48.000 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:14:50.470 --> 02:14:50.480 align:start position:0%
you know the uh ten brick and mortar
 
02:14:50.480 --> 02:14:51.510 align:start position:0%
you know the uh ten brick and mortar
facilities

02:14:51.510 --> 02:14:51.520 align:start position:0%
facilities
 
02:14:54.069 --> 02:14:54.079 align:start position:0%
and if uh if charlie mcintyre is
 
02:14:55.350 --> 02:14:55.360 align:start position:0%
stalling the call
 
02:14:57.750 --> 02:14:57.760 align:start position:0%
like we spoke of briefly yesterday mr
 
02:14:58.470 --> 02:14:58.480 align:start position:0%
chairman i
 
02:15:01.589 --> 02:15:01.599 align:start position:0%
i think uh both the lottery
 
02:15:03.910 --> 02:15:03.920 align:start position:0%
and the vendor draftkings have a lot to
 
02:15:04.950 --> 02:15:04.960 align:start position:0%
say in that
 
02:15:08.950 --> 02:15:08.960 align:start position:0%
um and it's it's my understanding so i i
 
02:15:10.229 --> 02:15:10.239 align:start position:0%
don't think there'd be a problem with
 
02:15:12.790 --> 02:15:12.800 align:start position:0%
that being amended it's my understanding
 
02:15:15.669 --> 02:15:15.679 align:start position:0%
that uh they don't expect to get to the
 
02:15:18.629 --> 02:15:18.639 align:start position:0%
ten locations as it is so
 
02:15:23.030 --> 02:15:23.040 align:start position:0%
uh okay shall we one of the attendees i
 
02:15:24.709 --> 02:15:24.719 align:start position:0%
could bring him in
 
02:15:28.390 --> 02:15:28.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:33.350 --> 02:15:33.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:35.350 --> 02:15:35.360 align:start position:0%
uh good morning mr chairman can you hear
 
02:15:36.790 --> 02:15:36.800 align:start position:0%
me yes we can
 
02:15:39.510 --> 02:15:39.520 align:start position:0%
charlie hi good morning mr members of
 
02:15:41.109 --> 02:15:41.119 align:start position:0%
the committee charlie mcintyre hampshire
 
02:15:42.069 --> 02:15:42.079 align:start position:0%
lottery here
 
02:15:44.310 --> 02:15:44.320 align:start position:0%
um i believe the question is do we
 
02:15:45.430 --> 02:15:45.440 align:start position:0%
anticipate getting to
 
02:15:48.790 --> 02:15:48.800 align:start position:0%
10 locations in any time soon the answer
 
02:15:50.390 --> 02:15:50.400 align:start position:0%
is no so
 
02:15:53.430 --> 02:15:53.440 align:start position:0%
um we are two now
 
02:15:56.390 --> 02:15:56.400 align:start position:0%
we have two more we're looking at
 
02:15:58.550 --> 02:15:58.560 align:start position:0%
actively and a fifth one
 
02:16:01.750 --> 02:16:01.760 align:start position:0%
potentially so um within the next two
 
02:16:03.830 --> 02:16:03.840 align:start position:0%
years it would be incredibly unlikely we
 
02:16:03.840 --> 02:16:04.229 align:start position:0%
years it would be incredibly unlikely we
would

02:16:04.229 --> 02:16:04.239 align:start position:0%
would
 
02:16:09.270 --> 02:16:09.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:13.830 --> 02:16:13.840 align:start position:0%
okay so that shouldn't be a problem with
 
02:16:16.550 --> 02:16:16.560 align:start position:0%
the proposed amendment we don't i don't
 
02:16:19.669 --> 02:16:19.679 align:start position:0%
sir no okay
 
02:16:22.709 --> 02:16:22.719 align:start position:0%
any other questions i want to ask
 
02:16:22.719 --> 02:16:27.830 align:start position:0%
any other questions i want to ask
challenge

02:16:27.830 --> 02:16:27.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:31.510 --> 02:16:31.520 align:start position:0%
representative romney yeah this actually
 
02:16:32.309 --> 02:16:32.319 align:start position:0%
is a
 
02:16:35.669 --> 02:16:35.679 align:start position:0%
question for for uh charlie so
 
02:16:37.509 --> 02:16:37.519 align:start position:0%
yeah my hypothesis that i threw out
 
02:16:38.790 --> 02:16:38.800 align:start position:0%
there the other day
 
02:16:40.469 --> 02:16:40.479 align:start position:0%
when this bill was uh being uh
 
02:16:40.479 --> 02:16:42.070 align:start position:0%
when this bill was uh being uh
introduced

02:16:42.070 --> 02:16:42.080 align:start position:0%
introduced
 
02:16:46.549 --> 02:16:46.559 align:start position:0%
was would it be a disincentive
 
02:16:49.429 --> 02:16:49.439 align:start position:0%
given that there's a high risk here and
 
02:16:49.439 --> 02:16:49.910 align:start position:0%
given that there's a high risk here and
uh

02:16:49.910 --> 02:16:49.920 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:16:52.389 --> 02:16:52.399 align:start position:0%
to bender and then and then there's only
 
02:16:54.870 --> 02:16:54.880 align:start position:0%
so many people who are going to be
 
02:16:57.190 --> 02:16:57.200 align:start position:0%
willing to wager on sports betting in
 
02:16:58.549 --> 02:16:58.559 align:start position:0%
the state
 
02:17:01.589 --> 02:17:01.599 align:start position:0%
plus we do still have the the the the
 
02:17:03.349 --> 02:17:03.359 align:start position:0%
apps on their people's phones so not
 
02:17:04.150 --> 02:17:04.160 align:start position:0%
everybody's going to go to a
 
02:17:06.230 --> 02:17:06.240 align:start position:0%
brick-and-mortar place
 
02:17:10.150 --> 02:17:10.160 align:start position:0%
so what if i was thinking of jumping in
 
02:17:13.589 --> 02:17:13.599 align:start position:0%
as a business to being a location for
 
02:17:13.599 --> 02:17:14.549 align:start position:0%
as a business to being a location for
this

02:17:14.549 --> 02:17:14.559 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:17:16.389 --> 02:17:16.399 align:start position:0%
would it be a disincentive to them to
 
02:17:18.870 --> 02:17:18.880 align:start position:0%
jump in knowing that
 
02:17:22.150 --> 02:17:22.160 align:start position:0%
is unlimited number of locations
 
02:17:25.030 --> 02:17:25.040 align:start position:0%
potentially that would that would eat
 
02:17:26.230 --> 02:17:26.240 align:start position:0%
into the
 
02:17:29.110 --> 02:17:29.120 align:start position:0%
total number of uh you know total number
 
02:17:30.230 --> 02:17:30.240 align:start position:0%
of people that are going to bet
 
02:17:34.070 --> 02:17:34.080 align:start position:0%
anyway uh that was my only hypothesis
 
02:17:34.080 --> 02:17:34.389 align:start position:0%
anyway uh that was my only hypothesis
that

02:17:34.389 --> 02:17:34.399 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:17:36.629 --> 02:17:36.639 align:start position:0%
i i i don't know the answer to that i
 
02:17:37.750 --> 02:17:37.760 align:start position:0%
just don't know if you have an opinion
 
02:17:38.709 --> 02:17:38.719 align:start position:0%
on that
 
02:17:40.309 --> 02:17:40.319 align:start position:0%
knowing what you do about these folks
 
02:17:42.150 --> 02:17:42.160 align:start position:0%
that run the the charitable gaming
 
02:17:43.349 --> 02:17:43.359 align:start position:0%
locations or
 
02:17:44.950 --> 02:17:44.960 align:start position:0%
other locations they may want to jump
 
02:17:47.110 --> 02:17:47.120 align:start position:0%
into this
 
02:17:48.709 --> 02:17:48.719 align:start position:0%
i mean certainly we haven't had the
 
02:17:51.110 --> 02:17:51.120 align:start position:0%
issue yet only because they have been so
 
02:17:53.509 --> 02:17:53.519 align:start position:0%
separated in terms of the locations i
 
02:17:55.509 --> 02:17:55.519 align:start position:0%
imagine that's the case
 
02:17:57.030 --> 02:17:57.040 align:start position:0%
that a business would would be less
 
02:17:58.950 --> 02:17:58.960 align:start position:0%
likely to invest significant capital in
 
02:17:59.750 --> 02:17:59.760 align:start position:0%
making it a first
 
02:18:02.389 --> 02:18:02.399 align:start position:0%
class outfit i can tell you that the
 
02:18:04.150 --> 02:18:04.160 align:start position:0%
customer base between the physical
 
02:18:05.990 --> 02:18:06.000 align:start position:0%
locations and the mobile
 
02:18:08.950 --> 02:18:08.960 align:start position:0%
is entirely different folks who go to
 
02:18:10.469 --> 02:18:10.479 align:start position:0%
physical locations
 
02:18:11.910 --> 02:18:11.920 align:start position:0%
are folks who just aren't comfortable
 
02:18:14.469 --> 02:18:14.479 align:start position:0%
with their phone or like being in person
 
02:18:17.429 --> 02:18:17.439 align:start position:0%
uh and tend to be older and wealthier
 
02:18:19.349 --> 02:18:19.359 align:start position:0%
folks who do it on they use the phone
 
02:18:20.309 --> 02:18:20.319 align:start position:0%
and computer
 
02:18:23.190 --> 02:18:23.200 align:start position:0%
to be younger and not as wealthy and bet
 
02:18:24.870 --> 02:18:24.880 align:start position:0%
much less per wager
 
02:18:28.950 --> 02:18:28.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:31.270 --> 02:18:31.280 align:start position:0%
yep okay that actually does make sense
 
02:18:32.309 --> 02:18:32.319 align:start position:0%
joe thank you
 
02:18:36.230 --> 02:18:36.240 align:start position:0%
thank you okay
 
02:18:42.389 --> 02:18:42.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:45.429 --> 02:18:45.439 align:start position:0%
we had a brief discussion yesterday
 
02:18:48.230 --> 02:18:48.240 align:start position:0%
thanks to representative abrami about
 
02:18:50.950 --> 02:18:50.960 align:start position:0%
how it worked out for
 
02:18:54.150 --> 02:18:54.160 align:start position:0%
new hampshire on the super bowl game
 
02:18:55.990 --> 02:18:56.000 align:start position:0%
and maybe in a paragraph you could
 
02:18:57.830 --> 02:18:57.840 align:start position:0%
explain it
 
02:18:59.190 --> 02:18:59.200 align:start position:0%
um representative tucker not to get
 
02:19:00.709 --> 02:19:00.719 align:start position:0%
ahead of me i've been asked the question
 
02:19:02.389 --> 02:19:02.399 align:start position:0%
but i've been asked to present to you
 
02:19:03.669 --> 02:19:03.679 align:start position:0%
folks next week
 
02:19:05.750 --> 02:19:05.760 align:start position:0%
on this very question so i was going to
 
02:19:07.750 --> 02:19:07.760 align:start position:0%
prepare something ahead of it i'm not
 
02:19:08.709 --> 02:19:08.719 align:start position:0%
ready yet
 
02:19:16.070 --> 02:19:16.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:18.790 --> 02:19:18.800 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you any further
 
02:19:20.230 --> 02:19:20.240 align:start position:0%
questions with charlie
 
02:19:23.429 --> 02:19:23.439 align:start position:0%
or anybody
 
02:19:27.750 --> 02:19:27.760 align:start position:0%
i see no more hands up so then
 
02:19:30.469 --> 02:19:30.479 align:start position:0%
tomorrow hopefully we'll have that
 
02:19:30.479 --> 02:19:32.629 align:start position:0%
tomorrow hopefully we'll have that
amendment

02:19:32.629 --> 02:19:32.639 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
02:19:38.629 --> 02:19:38.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:42.150 --> 02:19:42.160 align:start position:0%
that leaves us i believe with two bills
 
02:19:42.160 --> 02:19:42.629 align:start position:0%
that leaves us i believe with two bills
left

02:19:42.629 --> 02:19:42.639 align:start position:0%
left
 
02:19:51.830 --> 02:19:51.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:55.830 --> 02:19:55.840 align:start position:0%
and 568 now 210
 
02:19:58.070 --> 02:19:58.080 align:start position:0%
is an act increasing exemptions under
 
02:20:00.070 --> 02:20:00.080 align:start position:0%
the interest and dividend tax
 
02:20:01.910 --> 02:20:01.920 align:start position:0%
and decrease in the total amount of
 
02:20:03.670 --> 02:20:03.680 align:start position:0%
research and development credits against
 
02:20:07.110 --> 02:20:07.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:10.230 --> 02:20:10.240 align:start position:0%
house bill 568
 
02:20:12.790 --> 02:20:12.800 align:start position:0%
is an act increasing the exemptions to
 
02:20:14.309 --> 02:20:14.319 align:start position:0%
the interest and dividends tax
 
02:20:20.150 --> 02:20:20.160 align:start position:0%
and repealing the tax in 2025
 
02:20:29.429 --> 02:20:29.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:34.309 --> 02:20:34.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:37.910 --> 02:20:37.920 align:start position:0%
is 210 lines built that is
 
02:20:41.429 --> 02:20:41.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:44.630 --> 02:20:44.640 align:start position:0%
that's i think i think there's
 
02:20:46.950 --> 02:20:46.960 align:start position:0%
uh well at least i'll speak to our
 
02:20:46.960 --> 02:20:48.230 align:start position:0%
uh well at least i'll speak to our
caucus

02:20:48.230 --> 02:20:48.240 align:start position:0%
caucus
 
02:20:50.150 --> 02:20:50.160 align:start position:0%
and i forget about the caucus first i
 
02:20:52.309 --> 02:20:52.319 align:start position:0%
mean i i kind of supported the idea of
 
02:20:54.950 --> 02:20:54.960 align:start position:0%
increasing the exemptions and it seems
 
02:20:56.630 --> 02:20:56.640 align:start position:0%
like our caucus
 
02:20:59.750 --> 02:20:59.760 align:start position:0%
agrees to that now the degree to that
 
02:21:02.070 --> 02:21:02.080 align:start position:0%
to how much they should be increased is
 
02:21:03.670 --> 02:21:03.680 align:start position:0%
still being debated
 
02:21:07.190 --> 02:21:07.200 align:start position:0%
within our caucus at this point
 
02:21:09.830 --> 02:21:09.840 align:start position:0%
so and i think we're also all in
 
02:21:11.429 --> 02:21:11.439 align:start position:0%
agreement that
 
02:21:14.710 --> 02:21:14.720 align:start position:0%
if we do something we should not uh
 
02:21:17.910 --> 02:21:17.920 align:start position:0%
reduce the uh the r d
 
02:21:22.230 --> 02:21:22.240 align:start position:0%
tax credit um i think we heard some
 
02:21:24.389 --> 02:21:24.399 align:start position:0%
testimony during our hearings a couple
 
02:21:26.230 --> 02:21:26.240 align:start position:0%
weeks ago from businesses that
 
02:21:29.270 --> 02:21:29.280 align:start position:0%
well two of them anyway that told us why
 
02:21:30.150 --> 02:21:30.160 align:start position:0%
they didn't
 
02:21:32.550 --> 02:21:32.560 align:start position:0%
see that as a good idea and i think the
 
02:21:33.510 --> 02:21:33.520 align:start position:0%
bia and other
 
02:21:37.270 --> 02:21:37.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:39.990 --> 02:21:40.000 align:start position:0%
really discouraging us to do that i mean
 
02:21:41.830 --> 02:21:41.840 align:start position:0%
that that this is a carrier bill from a
 
02:21:43.510 --> 02:21:43.520 align:start position:0%
couple years ago where we were making an
 
02:21:46.230 --> 02:21:46.240 align:start position:0%
attempt to make this a budget neutral
 
02:21:49.830 --> 02:21:49.840 align:start position:0%
uh thing that we would reduce the
 
02:21:53.030 --> 02:21:53.040 align:start position:0%
uh increase the ex exemptions
 
02:21:56.309 --> 02:21:56.319 align:start position:0%
and but pay for it by reducing the r d
 
02:22:00.389 --> 02:22:00.399 align:start position:0%
tax credit money so uh
 
02:22:03.110 --> 02:22:03.120 align:start position:0%
yeah i i think we're i think as a caucus
 
02:22:04.309 --> 02:22:04.319 align:start position:0%
we're going to come down one way or
 
02:22:04.319 --> 02:22:04.870 align:start position:0%
we're going to come down one way or
another

02:22:04.870 --> 02:22:04.880 align:start position:0%
another
 
02:22:07.990 --> 02:22:08.000 align:start position:0%
on this um but
 
02:22:09.830 --> 02:22:09.840 align:start position:0%
i don't think we're there yet uh other
 
02:22:11.270 --> 02:22:11.280 align:start position:0%
than those two principles
 
02:22:14.469 --> 02:22:14.479 align:start position:0%
are are definitely r d reduction in r d
 
02:22:15.590 --> 02:22:15.600 align:start position:0%
tax credit
 
02:22:17.030 --> 02:22:17.040 align:start position:0%
and as i'm also thinking of the other
 
02:22:18.389 --> 02:22:18.399 align:start position:0%
bill as well when i'm making the
 
02:22:18.399 --> 02:22:19.670 align:start position:0%
bill as well when i'm making the
statement

02:22:19.670 --> 02:22:19.680 align:start position:0%
statement
 
02:22:22.710 --> 02:22:22.720 align:start position:0%
uh and that let's this is one of those
 
02:22:24.070 --> 02:22:24.080 align:start position:0%
we hope that uh
 
02:22:26.550 --> 02:22:26.560 align:start position:0%
all of us can kind of come together on a
 
02:22:28.469 --> 02:22:28.479 align:start position:0%
sort of a happy medium here so
 
02:22:31.270 --> 02:22:31.280 align:start position:0%
as best we can but anyway that's where
 
02:22:31.830 --> 02:22:31.840 align:start position:0%
that's where
 
02:22:35.110 --> 02:22:35.120 align:start position:0%
my mind is on this uh and i i don't i
 
02:22:36.230 --> 02:22:36.240 align:start position:0%
don't think our caucus is
 
02:22:38.389 --> 02:22:38.399 align:start position:0%
is solidified behind uh a final
 
02:22:38.399 --> 02:22:40.469 align:start position:0%
is solidified behind uh a final
recommendation

02:22:40.469 --> 02:22:40.479 align:start position:0%
recommendation
 
02:22:43.830 --> 02:22:43.840 align:start position:0%
representation you want to speak
 
02:22:46.950 --> 02:22:46.960 align:start position:0%
thank you on this
 
02:22:50.309 --> 02:22:50.319 align:start position:0%
this tax is a very difficult one for
 
02:22:53.910 --> 02:22:53.920 align:start position:0%
my caucus because as i said yesterday
 
02:22:57.110 --> 02:22:57.120 align:start position:0%
on that triangle represents
 
02:23:00.230 --> 02:23:00.240 align:start position:0%
people at all income levels in
 
02:23:04.550 --> 02:23:04.560 align:start position:0%
in all of the lower level
 
02:23:08.309 --> 02:23:08.319 align:start position:0%
taxpayers the first three layers at
 
02:23:08.950 --> 02:23:08.960 align:start position:0%
least of
 
02:23:12.230 --> 02:23:12.240 align:start position:0%
low-level taxpayers and some of them
 
02:23:15.830 --> 02:23:15.840 align:start position:0%
are low-level but
 
02:23:17.990 --> 02:23:18.000 align:start position:0%
very wealthy otherwise since we do not
 
02:23:20.230 --> 02:23:20.240 align:start position:0%
have an income tax there's no way
 
02:23:23.510 --> 02:23:23.520 align:start position:0%
to do a reasonable exemption
 
02:23:26.550 --> 02:23:26.560 align:start position:0%
that for the poorest people who depend
 
02:23:27.910 --> 02:23:27.920 align:start position:0%
on that money
 
02:23:31.030 --> 02:23:31.040 align:start position:0%
on without also giving the exemption to
 
02:23:32.230 --> 02:23:32.240 align:start position:0%
people on
 
02:23:34.710 --> 02:23:34.720 align:start position:0%
that for whom that is just a very small
 
02:23:36.309 --> 02:23:36.319 align:start position:0%
part of a very large
 
02:23:39.510 --> 02:23:39.520 align:start position:0%
income that they have and
 
02:23:42.710 --> 02:23:42.720 align:start position:0%
um so
 
02:23:45.990 --> 02:23:46.000 align:start position:0%
i think we would be if the exemptions
 
02:23:48.070 --> 02:23:48.080 align:start position:0%
haven't been raised for a very long time
 
02:23:49.990 --> 02:23:50.000 align:start position:0%
and partly because of that reason
 
02:23:53.830 --> 02:23:53.840 align:start position:0%
and the tax uh provides
 
02:23:56.870 --> 02:23:56.880 align:start position:0%
a very significant amount of money to
 
02:24:00.070 --> 02:24:00.080 align:start position:0%
our budget on
 
02:24:03.349 --> 02:24:03.359 align:start position:0%
so we would be i think
 
02:24:06.389 --> 02:24:06.399 align:start position:0%
open to discussing an exemption
 
02:24:09.750 --> 02:24:09.760 align:start position:0%
that was uh lower than the one that is
 
02:24:10.469 --> 02:24:10.479 align:start position:0%
in here
 
02:24:13.510 --> 02:24:13.520 align:start position:0%
that would target to the lowest amounts
 
02:24:14.630 --> 02:24:14.640 align:start position:0%
that are paid
 
02:24:17.349 --> 02:24:17.359 align:start position:0%
it would also reduce the paperwork for a
 
02:24:18.230 --> 02:24:18.240 align:start position:0%
huge number
 
02:24:21.349 --> 02:24:21.359 align:start position:0%
of people that are now paying nothing or
 
02:24:24.389 --> 02:24:24.399 align:start position:0%
one dollar but have to file
 
02:24:26.630 --> 02:24:26.640 align:start position:0%
because they come in and out of that
 
02:24:28.550 --> 02:24:28.560 align:start position:0%
exemption level
 
02:24:32.309 --> 02:24:32.319 align:start position:0%
and um but on
 
02:24:35.349 --> 02:24:35.359 align:start position:0%
i i'd like to see
 
02:24:38.389 --> 02:24:38.399 align:start position:0%
the chair ask dra
 
02:24:41.429 --> 02:24:41.439 align:start position:0%
to to model what
 
02:24:44.950 --> 02:24:44.960 align:start position:0%
on how much it would cost at
 
02:24:47.429 --> 02:24:47.439 align:start position:0%
a couple of different exemptions of his
 
02:24:47.439 --> 02:24:48.469 align:start position:0%
a couple of different exemptions of his
choice

02:24:48.469 --> 02:24:48.479 align:start position:0%
choice
 
02:24:52.389 --> 02:24:52.399 align:start position:0%
on that we're in between what the bill
 
02:24:55.510 --> 02:24:55.520 align:start position:0%
offers uh which is about six million
 
02:24:55.520 --> 02:24:55.990 align:start position:0%
offers uh which is about six million
dollars

02:24:55.990 --> 02:24:56.000 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
02:25:00.230 --> 02:25:00.240 align:start position:0%
usually of of money to us to our budget
 
02:25:04.790 --> 02:25:04.800 align:start position:0%
on and and no increase
 
02:25:07.830 --> 02:25:07.840 align:start position:0%
in the exemption so uh
 
02:25:09.670 --> 02:25:09.680 align:start position:0%
and i think that they must be able to do
 
02:25:13.349 --> 02:25:13.359 align:start position:0%
that since they could do the triangle
 
02:25:16.469 --> 02:25:16.479 align:start position:0%
anything about the r d
 
02:25:19.830 --> 02:25:19.840 align:start position:0%
oh and uh yeah we we would rather
 
02:25:23.429 --> 02:25:23.439 align:start position:0%
not uh at this time consider
 
02:25:27.429 --> 02:25:27.439 align:start position:0%
reducing the r d tax credit
 
02:25:29.910 --> 02:25:29.920 align:start position:0%
we we have been getting some more
 
02:25:29.920 --> 02:25:30.710 align:start position:0%
we we have been getting some more
information

02:25:30.710 --> 02:25:30.720 align:start position:0%
information
 
02:25:34.070 --> 02:25:34.080 align:start position:0%
from the the people that are
 
02:25:36.790 --> 02:25:36.800 align:start position:0%
using it it would be really nice if we
 
02:25:37.670 --> 02:25:37.680 align:start position:0%
could get
 
02:25:40.870 --> 02:25:40.880 align:start position:0%
the business and economic affairs or the
 
02:25:40.880 --> 02:25:41.750 align:start position:0%
the business and economic affairs or the
dra

02:25:41.750 --> 02:25:41.760 align:start position:0%
dra
 
02:25:44.790 --> 02:25:44.800 align:start position:0%
to provide more information
 
02:25:48.150 --> 02:25:48.160 align:start position:0%
about how it's being used
 
02:25:52.710 --> 02:25:52.720 align:start position:0%
you want the incremental increase
 
02:25:56.309 --> 02:25:56.319 align:start position:0%
or decrease in taxes
 
02:25:59.750 --> 02:25:59.760 align:start position:0%
for increasing the exemption yes how
 
02:26:00.870 --> 02:26:00.880 align:start position:0%
much it would cost
 
02:26:03.349 --> 02:26:03.359 align:start position:0%
the budget right and our revenue
 
02:26:06.870 --> 02:26:06.880 align:start position:0%
estimates to uh to
 
02:26:10.389 --> 02:26:10.399 align:start position:0%
put the exemption at
 
02:26:14.550 --> 02:26:14.560 align:start position:0%
2000 or at 2 200.
 
02:26:19.750 --> 02:26:19.760 align:start position:0%
i forget where it starts at 2400.
 
02:26:22.710 --> 02:26:22.720 align:start position:0%
that's so sorry i was trying to remember
 
02:26:23.590 --> 02:26:23.600 align:start position:0%
i don't know why
 
02:26:26.309 --> 02:26:26.319 align:start position:0%
i've been paying this for years why it
 
02:26:26.319 --> 02:26:27.349 align:start position:0%
i've been paying this for years why it
would

02:26:27.349 --> 02:26:27.359 align:start position:0%
would
 
02:26:30.950 --> 02:26:30.960 align:start position:0%
would why it sticks in my head is 1800
 
02:26:34.150 --> 02:26:34.160 align:start position:0%
um but just go to go up
 
02:26:37.349 --> 02:26:37.359 align:start position:0%
above 2400 at at
 
02:26:42.309 --> 02:26:42.319 align:start position:0%
200 on 200 dollar increments
 
02:26:45.590 --> 02:26:45.600 align:start position:0%
in 200 well
 
02:26:49.030 --> 02:26:49.040 align:start position:0%
make the exemption 2600. and see
 
02:26:52.469 --> 02:26:52.479 align:start position:0%
what that does make the exemption at 20
 
02:26:56.790 --> 02:26:56.800 align:start position:0%
800 and see what that does
 
02:26:59.910 --> 02:26:59.920 align:start position:0%
yeah and these are steps in that
 
02:27:03.110 --> 02:27:03.120 align:start position:0%
about 3 000. because
 
02:27:07.270 --> 02:27:07.280 align:start position:0%
like going from 2400
 
02:27:13.750 --> 02:27:13.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:17.429 --> 02:27:17.439 align:start position:0%
yes it does but if we going from
 
02:27:21.030 --> 02:27:21.040 align:start position:0%
2400 to 3500 i guess is
 
02:27:24.150 --> 02:27:24.160 align:start position:0%
it it's about five million dollars
 
02:27:27.270 --> 02:27:27.280 align:start position:0%
if they want to reduce the
 
02:27:34.070 --> 02:27:34.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:37.110 --> 02:27:37.120 align:start position:0%
yeah the question is how many of those
 
02:27:40.070 --> 02:27:40.080 align:start position:0%
people are well for one thing some of
 
02:27:41.190 --> 02:27:41.200 align:start position:0%
them are couples
 
02:27:43.990 --> 02:27:44.000 align:start position:0%
with uh who are over 65 and they get
 
02:27:45.110 --> 02:27:45.120 align:start position:0%
more money
 
02:27:48.950 --> 02:27:48.960 align:start position:0%
uh more exemption but how many of those
 
02:27:50.389 --> 02:27:50.399 align:start position:0%
people who are paying
 
02:27:53.750 --> 02:27:53.760 align:start position:0%
one to 500 for instance are
 
02:27:57.110 --> 02:27:57.120 align:start position:0%
are actually
 
02:28:00.950 --> 02:28:00.960 align:start position:0%
covered by by a
 
02:28:04.389 --> 02:28:04.399 align:start position:0%
2600 to 2800 a 3 000
 
02:28:07.429 --> 02:28:07.439 align:start position:0%
exemption and i think that
 
02:28:10.550 --> 02:28:10.560 align:start position:0%
that the dra probably can
 
02:28:19.670 --> 02:28:19.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:22.790 --> 02:28:22.800 align:start position:0%
okay anything
 
02:28:27.510 --> 02:28:27.520 align:start position:0%
else on this particular bill
 
02:28:30.870 --> 02:28:30.880 align:start position:0%
representative janigan thank you mr
 
02:28:30.880 --> 02:28:31.429 align:start position:0%
representative janigan thank you mr
chairman

02:28:31.429 --> 02:28:31.439 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
02:28:35.670 --> 02:28:35.680 align:start position:0%
um yeah just a couple points one is
 
02:28:38.950 --> 02:28:38.960 align:start position:0%
i am for increasing the exemption to
 
02:28:42.230 --> 02:28:42.240 align:start position:0%
which would help people on the lower
 
02:28:45.510 --> 02:28:45.520 align:start position:0%
scale there and even at
 
02:28:48.230 --> 02:28:48.240 align:start position:0%
but if you only include intro increase
 
02:28:50.469 --> 02:28:50.479 align:start position:0%
it by 200
 
02:28:53.910 --> 02:28:53.920 align:start position:0%
205 percent of 200 is ten dollars so
 
02:28:54.870 --> 02:28:54.880 align:start position:0%
you'd only be
 
02:28:56.630 --> 02:28:56.640 align:start position:0%
relieving that taxpayer of ten dollars
 
02:28:58.150 --> 02:28:58.160 align:start position:0%
so you probably do need
 
02:29:00.309 --> 02:29:00.319 align:start position:0%
bigger and i would be for a bigger
 
02:29:01.670 --> 02:29:01.680 align:start position:0%
bigger increase
 
02:29:03.750 --> 02:29:03.760 align:start position:0%
um the and the other point i want to
 
02:29:05.190 --> 02:29:05.200 align:start position:0%
make it and it sounds like everyone is
 
02:29:06.950 --> 02:29:06.960 align:start position:0%
for not coupling these
 
02:29:09.510 --> 02:29:09.520 align:start position:0%
or most are for against not coupling
 
02:29:11.750 --> 02:29:11.760 align:start position:0%
this with the research and development
 
02:29:14.469 --> 02:29:14.479 align:start position:0%
uh tax credit i mean in my mind
 
02:29:16.230 --> 02:29:16.240 align:start position:0%
effectively you're trying to couple a
 
02:29:16.240 --> 02:29:17.190 align:start position:0%
effectively you're trying to couple a
personal

02:29:17.190 --> 02:29:17.200 align:start position:0%
personal
 
02:29:20.550 --> 02:29:20.560 align:start position:0%
tax with a with a with a
 
02:29:23.349 --> 02:29:23.359 align:start position:0%
exemption that helps businesses and
 
02:29:24.870 --> 02:29:24.880 align:start position:0%
probably not a good idea to be mixing
 
02:29:27.030 --> 02:29:27.040 align:start position:0%
personal and business taxes so
 
02:29:30.150 --> 02:29:30.160 align:start position:0%
um but anyways i just wanted to uh
 
02:29:33.270 --> 02:29:33.280 align:start position:0%
make that comment thank you mr chairman
 
02:29:36.790 --> 02:29:36.800 align:start position:0%
thank you representative representative
 
02:29:36.800 --> 02:29:40.230 align:start position:0%
thank you representative representative
baxter

02:29:40.230 --> 02:29:40.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:41.510 --> 02:29:41.520 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to speak to what
 
02:29:43.910 --> 02:29:43.920 align:start position:0%
representative genigean just said i
 
02:29:46.070 --> 02:29:46.080 align:start position:0%
i think he made a couple of great points
 
02:29:47.990 --> 02:29:48.000 align:start position:0%
regardless of what you think of the r d
 
02:29:49.590 --> 02:29:49.600 align:start position:0%
tax credit it doesn't really make a lot
 
02:29:51.030 --> 02:29:51.040 align:start position:0%
of sense to
 
02:29:52.870 --> 02:29:52.880 align:start position:0%
to have that be a part of the question
 
02:29:54.870 --> 02:29:54.880 align:start position:0%
on interest and dividends tax
 
02:29:57.990 --> 02:29:58.000 align:start position:0%
you're mixing personal business and and
 
02:29:58.000 --> 02:29:58.389 align:start position:0%
you're mixing personal business and and
i

02:29:58.389 --> 02:29:58.399 align:start position:0%
i
 
02:30:00.309 --> 02:30:00.319 align:start position:0%
agree with what he said that a lower
 
02:30:02.469 --> 02:30:02.479 align:start position:0%
exemption wouldn't necessarily have a
 
02:30:02.479 --> 02:30:03.670 align:start position:0%
exemption wouldn't necessarily have a
significant

02:30:03.670 --> 02:30:03.680 align:start position:0%
significant
 
02:30:06.790 --> 02:30:06.800 align:start position:0%
impact and even uh in
 
02:30:09.910 --> 02:30:09.920 align:start position:0%
house bill uh 568
 
02:30:13.030 --> 02:30:13.040 align:start position:0%
even going through that um
 
02:30:16.230 --> 02:30:16.240 align:start position:0%
that schedule of raising the exemptions
 
02:30:18.230 --> 02:30:18.240 align:start position:0%
we're still going to be able to keep
 
02:30:20.870 --> 02:30:20.880 align:start position:0%
uh the brunt of the revenue coming in
 
02:30:22.469 --> 02:30:22.479 align:start position:0%
because it's very much
 
02:30:24.790 --> 02:30:24.800 align:start position:0%
top-heavy so i think it's important that
 
02:30:26.389 --> 02:30:26.399 align:start position:0%
we continue to discuss this
 
02:30:29.030 --> 02:30:29.040 align:start position:0%
and listen from experts and we'll you
 
02:30:30.870 --> 02:30:30.880 align:start position:0%
know we'll have more
 
02:30:32.630 --> 02:30:32.640 align:start position:0%
debates and discussions about what the
 
02:30:34.389 --> 02:30:34.399 align:start position:0%
correct uh number is
 
02:30:37.510 --> 02:30:37.520 align:start position:0%
um and whether we go with 568 or scale
 
02:30:38.070 --> 02:30:38.080 align:start position:0%
it back
 
02:30:40.870 --> 02:30:40.880 align:start position:0%
um but i think um i think we're we're
 
02:30:41.910 --> 02:30:41.920 align:start position:0%
still the point where
 
02:30:44.150 --> 02:30:44.160 align:start position:0%
all members of the committee are um you
 
02:30:46.469 --> 02:30:46.479 align:start position:0%
know still thinking about um what their
 
02:30:49.590 --> 02:30:49.600 align:start position:0%
position is on the issue
 
02:30:53.110 --> 02:30:53.120 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative baxter
 
02:30:56.389 --> 02:30:56.399 align:start position:0%
uh representative yeah could i just
 
02:30:59.670 --> 02:30:59.680 align:start position:0%
add something that i don't think
 
02:31:02.150 --> 02:31:02.160 align:start position:0%
people may be thinking about which is
 
02:31:03.910 --> 02:31:03.920 align:start position:0%
that a lot of the people
 
02:31:07.830 --> 02:31:07.840 align:start position:0%
in that zero payment and one to 500
 
02:31:11.270 --> 02:31:11.280 align:start position:0%
payment are elderly people
 
02:31:14.870 --> 02:31:14.880 align:start position:0%
who are have to
 
02:31:17.349 --> 02:31:17.359 align:start position:0%
file because of where the exemption is
 
02:31:17.359 --> 02:31:18.150 align:start position:0%
file because of where the exemption is
now

02:31:18.150 --> 02:31:18.160 align:start position:0%
now
 
02:31:21.670 --> 02:31:21.680 align:start position:0%
and who have to find all of their income
 
02:31:24.790 --> 02:31:24.800 align:start position:0%
reports which can be difficult
 
02:31:27.349 --> 02:31:27.359 align:start position:0%
and take them down to the senior center
 
02:31:29.990 --> 02:31:30.000 align:start position:0%
or wherever and have a volunteer
 
02:31:32.630 --> 02:31:32.640 align:start position:0%
do it for them or they they feel they
 
02:31:33.510 --> 02:31:33.520 align:start position:0%
may feel that
 
02:31:36.630 --> 02:31:36.640 align:start position:0%
they have to pay h r block to do it for
 
02:31:36.640 --> 02:31:37.110 align:start position:0%
they have to pay h r block to do it for
them

02:31:37.110 --> 02:31:37.120 align:start position:0%
them
 
02:31:39.429 --> 02:31:39.439 align:start position:0%
which is going to cost them more money a
 
02:31:41.270 --> 02:31:41.280 align:start position:0%
lot more money than what they're paying
 
02:31:41.280 --> 02:31:43.030 align:start position:0%
lot more money than what they're paying
us

02:31:43.030 --> 02:31:43.040 align:start position:0%
us
 
02:31:47.270 --> 02:31:47.280 align:start position:0%
and on that raising the exemption just a
 
02:31:48.070 --> 02:31:48.080 align:start position:0%
little bit
 
02:31:51.349 --> 02:31:51.359 align:start position:0%
believes an awful lot of those people of
 
02:31:52.230 --> 02:31:52.240 align:start position:0%
the paperwork
 
02:31:55.429 --> 02:31:55.439 align:start position:0%
burden and possible cost of an
 
02:31:55.439 --> 02:31:56.790 align:start position:0%
burden and possible cost of an
accountant

02:31:56.790 --> 02:31:56.800 align:start position:0%
accountant
 
02:31:56.800 --> 02:32:00.469 align:start position:0%
accountant
thanks

02:32:00.469 --> 02:32:00.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:07.270 --> 02:32:07.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:10.150 --> 02:32:10.160 align:start position:0%
thank you yeah this just commenting on
 
02:32:12.389 --> 02:32:12.399 align:start position:0%
on that last uh
 
02:32:15.190 --> 02:32:15.200 align:start position:0%
observation by representative alame uh
 
02:32:15.990 --> 02:32:16.000 align:start position:0%
it triggered
 
02:32:19.429 --> 02:32:19.439 align:start position:0%
a thought uh we have in this uh
 
02:32:23.030 --> 02:32:23.040 align:start position:0%
this attacks a elderly exemption as well
 
02:32:23.040 --> 02:32:23.910 align:start position:0%
this attacks a elderly exemption as well
and

02:32:23.910 --> 02:32:23.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:32:26.950 --> 02:32:26.960 align:start position:0%
this bill i believe raises that
 
02:32:29.190 --> 02:32:29.200 align:start position:0%
along with the base exemption i assume
 
02:32:30.550 --> 02:32:30.560 align:start position:0%
that i don't have it right in front of
 
02:32:30.560 --> 02:32:32.150 align:start position:0%
that i don't have it right in front of
me

02:32:32.150 --> 02:32:32.160 align:start position:0%
me
 
02:32:35.750 --> 02:32:35.760 align:start position:0%
but in any event there is data that the
 
02:32:41.030 --> 02:32:41.040 align:start position:0%
dra has on people who are over 65
 
02:32:43.510 --> 02:32:43.520 align:start position:0%
because of that exemption and it should
 
02:32:43.520 --> 02:32:44.070 align:start position:0%
because of that exemption and it should
be

02:32:44.070 --> 02:32:44.080 align:start position:0%
be
 
02:32:46.870 --> 02:32:46.880 align:start position:0%
easy to access i think it'll be very
 
02:32:47.990 --> 02:32:48.000 align:start position:0%
helpful to all of us
 
02:32:51.830 --> 02:32:51.840 align:start position:0%
to understand the degree to which
 
02:32:55.110 --> 02:32:55.120 align:start position:0%
older people 65 years ago
 
02:32:59.030 --> 02:32:59.040 align:start position:0%
and over are in fact
 
02:33:02.469 --> 02:33:02.479 align:start position:0%
participants in this tax and
 
02:33:04.230 --> 02:33:04.240 align:start position:0%
to what degree they're benefiting from
 
02:33:06.230 --> 02:33:06.240 align:start position:0%
the current exemptions to the extent to
 
02:33:08.309 --> 02:33:08.319 align:start position:0%
which dra is able to provide that so i'm
 
02:33:10.550 --> 02:33:10.560 align:start position:0%
just that's just sort of an added
 
02:33:13.349 --> 02:33:13.359 align:start position:0%
uh part of the request to dra that i'm
 
02:33:13.359 --> 02:33:17.590 align:start position:0%
uh part of the request to dra that i'm
requesting

02:33:17.590 --> 02:33:17.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:20.550 --> 02:33:20.560 align:start position:0%
okay i just want to check the attendees
 
02:33:23.670 --> 02:33:23.680 align:start position:0%
melissa rollins is on
 
02:33:29.429 --> 02:33:29.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:32.469 --> 02:33:32.479 align:start position:0%
she's unmuted melissa
 
02:33:35.110 --> 02:33:35.120 align:start position:0%

02:33:36.950 --> 02:33:36.960 align:start position:0%
have anything you can add at this point
 
02:33:38.469 --> 02:33:38.479 align:start position:0%
in time
 
02:33:40.870 --> 02:33:40.880 align:start position:0%
sure um actually if you could unmute
 
02:33:43.270 --> 02:33:43.280 align:start position:0%

answers to you

over 65 i think he has the counts on
 
02:33:56.469 --> 02:33:56.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:58.950 --> 02:33:58.960 align:start position:0%
thank you melissa thank you chairman
 
02:33:59.910 --> 02:33:59.920 align:start position:0%
members of the committee
 
02:34:01.270 --> 02:34:01.280 align:start position:0%
this is devin roderick department of
 
02:34:05.110 --> 02:34:05.120 align:start position:0%
revenue um looking at tax here 2019 data
 
02:34:05.910 --> 02:34:05.920 align:start position:0%
for the ind
 
02:34:09.670 --> 02:34:09.680 align:start position:0%
tax um of the the um
 
02:34:13.429 --> 02:34:13.439 align:start position:0%
70 437
 
02:34:16.469 --> 02:34:16.479 align:start position:0%
ind returns filed
 
02:34:18.389 --> 02:34:18.399 align:start position:0%
and i can send you these numbers after
 
02:34:20.230 --> 02:34:20.240 align:start position:0%
oh yes please do
 
02:34:25.510 --> 02:34:25.520 align:start position:0%
yep i will 37 343 returns
 
02:34:28.950 --> 02:34:28.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:31.110 --> 02:34:31.120 align:start position:0%
those exemptions totaled and i'll break
 
02:34:33.110 --> 02:34:33.120 align:start position:0%
them down in a second for you
 
02:34:38.710 --> 02:34:38.720 align:start position:0%
those exemptions total 53 059
 
02:34:40.070 --> 02:34:40.080 align:start position:0%
so when we look at those total number
 
02:34:41.590 --> 02:34:41.600 align:start position:0%
exemptions some of those returns may
 
02:34:43.190 --> 02:34:43.200 align:start position:0%
claim of course more than one exemption
 
02:34:44.070 --> 02:34:44.080 align:start position:0%
depending on the
 
02:34:48.389 --> 02:34:48.399 align:start position:0%
qualifying factor of those 53 059
 
02:34:48.399 --> 02:34:50.070 align:start position:0%
qualifying factor of those 53 059
exemptions

02:34:50.070 --> 02:34:50.080 align:start position:0%
exemptions
 
02:34:53.190 --> 02:34:53.200 align:start position:0%
36 360
 
02:34:59.790 --> 02:34:59.800 align:start position:0%
or 65 or older or disabled
 
02:35:04.790 --> 02:35:04.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:08.870 --> 02:35:08.880 align:start position:0%
and 16471
 
02:35:12.710 --> 02:35:12.720 align:start position:0%
claimed the spouse being blind 65
 
02:35:15.590 --> 02:35:15.600 align:start position:0%
or older or disabled so this the spouse
 
02:35:18.230 --> 02:35:18.240 align:start position:0%
exemption is all grouped together
 
02:35:21.110 --> 02:35:21.120 align:start position:0%
that's based on the way our forms are
 
02:35:22.710 --> 02:35:22.720 align:start position:0%
the way the taxpayer completes our forms
 
02:35:24.309 --> 02:35:24.319 align:start position:0%
and the data that we have
 
02:35:25.750 --> 02:35:25.760 align:start position:0%
and we can most certainly take a look at
 
02:35:27.429 --> 02:35:27.439 align:start position:0%
what representative just um
 
02:35:29.830 --> 02:35:29.840 align:start position:0%
asked for a few minutes ago um at those
 
02:35:29.840 --> 02:35:30.630 align:start position:0%
asked for a few minutes ago um at those
varying

02:35:30.630 --> 02:35:30.640 align:start position:0%
varying
 
02:35:33.429 --> 02:35:33.439 align:start position:0%
levels of the um the actual income
 
02:35:33.439 --> 02:35:34.790 align:start position:0%
levels of the um the actual income
exemption

02:35:34.790 --> 02:35:34.800 align:start position:0%
exemption
 
02:35:37.910 --> 02:35:37.920 align:start position:0%
at levels of 2600 2800 and 3 000 we can
 
02:35:39.110 --> 02:35:39.120 align:start position:0%
take a look at that and get back to the
 
02:35:39.120 --> 02:35:39.590 align:start position:0%
take a look at that and get back to the
committee

02:35:39.590 --> 02:35:39.600 align:start position:0%
committee
 
02:35:42.710 --> 02:35:42.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:45.750 --> 02:35:45.760 align:start position:0%
okay and you'll send that to us
 
02:35:47.910 --> 02:35:47.920 align:start position:0%
and then i can make sure it gets the
 
02:35:47.920 --> 02:35:50.150 align:start position:0%
and then i can make sure it gets the
committee

02:35:50.150 --> 02:35:50.160 align:start position:0%
committee
 
02:35:53.030 --> 02:35:53.040 align:start position:0%

just wanted to comment briefly on the
 
02:36:05.670 --> 02:36:05.680 align:start position:0%
other half
 
02:36:08.790 --> 02:36:08.800 align:start position:0%
of the bill it's this research
 
02:36:11.510 --> 02:36:11.520 align:start position:0%
and development tax credit and uh say
 
02:36:13.349 --> 02:36:13.359 align:start position:0%
that i do agree with taking that out
 
02:36:15.990 --> 02:36:16.000 align:start position:0%
but i want to want to say that the
 
02:36:17.990 --> 02:36:18.000 align:start position:0%
reason it was in there i believe this is
 
02:36:18.000 --> 02:36:18.550 align:start position:0%
reason it was in there i believe this is
true

02:36:18.550 --> 02:36:18.560 align:start position:0%
true
 
02:36:20.790 --> 02:36:20.800 align:start position:0%
representative abrami can correct me if
 
02:36:23.429 --> 02:36:23.439 align:start position:0%
i'm wrong
 
02:36:26.870 --> 02:36:26.880 align:start position:0%
was that the thought of the proponents
 
02:36:27.670 --> 02:36:27.680 align:start position:0%
of the bill
 
02:36:29.670 --> 02:36:29.680 align:start position:0%
originally was that they wanted to
 
02:36:33.270 --> 02:36:33.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:35.590 --> 02:36:35.600 align:start position:0%
so that the revenue that would be lost
 
02:36:38.469 --> 02:36:38.479 align:start position:0%
by the increased exemptions would be
 
02:36:40.309 --> 02:36:40.319 align:start position:0%
balanced by revenue that would be gained
 
02:36:42.070 --> 02:36:42.080 align:start position:0%
from something else and what they chose
 
02:36:44.389 --> 02:36:44.399 align:start position:0%
was the research and development
 
02:36:46.150 --> 02:36:46.160 align:start position:0%
piece i've always opposed the bill
 
02:36:48.389 --> 02:36:48.399 align:start position:0%
actually for that reason because i
 
02:36:51.510 --> 02:36:51.520 align:start position:0%
i didn't want to go with that with
 
02:36:53.590 --> 02:36:53.600 align:start position:0%
removing that tax credit
 
02:36:57.190 --> 02:36:57.200 align:start position:0%
um but i i i do support the gen
 
02:37:01.030 --> 02:37:01.040 align:start position:0%
in general this uh
 
02:37:04.870 --> 02:37:04.880 align:start position:0%
effort to present a balance
 
02:37:08.070 --> 02:37:08.080 align:start position:0%
when we cut cut revenues
 
02:37:10.710 --> 02:37:10.720 align:start position:0%
uh trying to show how we'll match the
 
02:37:10.720 --> 02:37:12.550 align:start position:0%
uh trying to show how we'll match the
cut

02:37:12.550 --> 02:37:12.560 align:start position:0%
cut
 
02:37:15.429 --> 02:37:15.439 align:start position:0%
and sort of as a general principle if we
 
02:37:16.150 --> 02:37:16.160 align:start position:0%
keep this low
 
02:37:18.870 --> 02:37:18.880 align:start position:0%
enough and i think that's uh what we're
 
02:37:20.550 --> 02:37:20.560 align:start position:0%
talking about here it's a relatively
 
02:37:22.150 --> 02:37:22.160 align:start position:0%
small amount of money
 
02:37:25.750 --> 02:37:25.760 align:start position:0%
and it's certainly uh the the need for
 
02:37:27.349 --> 02:37:27.359 align:start position:0%
increasing the exemptions
 
02:37:30.870 --> 02:37:30.880 align:start position:0%
is uh i think uh is very real
 
02:37:33.429 --> 02:37:33.439 align:start position:0%
and relates to the fact that they
 
02:37:35.110 --> 02:37:35.120 align:start position:0%
haven't been raised for years and years
 
02:37:36.389 --> 02:37:36.399 align:start position:0%
and years i don't know how long it's
 
02:37:36.399 --> 02:37:37.910 align:start position:0%
and years i don't know how long it's
been

02:37:37.910 --> 02:37:37.920 align:start position:0%
been
 
02:37:40.950 --> 02:37:40.960 align:start position:0%
but so so that's good
 
02:37:44.630 --> 02:37:44.640 align:start position:0%
um i i guess i wish we could go much
 
02:37:46.790 --> 02:37:46.800 align:start position:0%
higher on the exemptions
 
02:37:49.190 --> 02:37:49.200 align:start position:0%
but then we got into big money so
 
02:37:50.870 --> 02:37:50.880 align:start position:0%
there's a balance here
 
02:37:53.590 --> 02:37:53.600 align:start position:0%
and going up some makes sense to me
 
02:37:56.389 --> 02:37:56.399 align:start position:0%
let's get a good handle on the costs and
 
02:37:59.510 --> 02:37:59.520 align:start position:0%
go into it with our eyes open so that's
 
02:38:01.830 --> 02:38:01.840 align:start position:0%
what i wanted to say
 
02:38:03.510 --> 02:38:03.520 align:start position:0%
cherry can i respond that's just my name
 
02:38:05.429 --> 02:38:05.439 align:start position:0%
was mentioned um
 
02:38:09.030 --> 02:38:09.040 align:start position:0%
representative romney thank you so yeah
 
02:38:11.990 --> 02:38:12.000 align:start position:0%
uh i'm trying to recall the the genesis
 
02:38:13.030 --> 02:38:13.040 align:start position:0%
of all of this but
 
02:38:17.030 --> 02:38:17.040 align:start position:0%
um when i was i i've been a legislation
 
02:38:20.389 --> 02:38:20.399 align:start position:0%
11 years now so when i first was uh
 
02:38:22.870 --> 02:38:22.880 align:start position:0%
you know let's go say 10 years ago the
 
02:38:24.070 --> 02:38:24.080 align:start position:0%
tax exemption
 
02:38:27.190 --> 02:38:27.200 align:start position:0%
the tax excuse me the tax credit for r d
 
02:38:30.070 --> 02:38:30.080 align:start position:0%
was a million dollars that was it
 
02:38:33.910 --> 02:38:33.920 align:start position:0%
and uh then we agreed a year or two
 
02:38:36.870 --> 02:38:36.880 align:start position:0%
after that that maybe we house and
 
02:38:38.469 --> 02:38:38.479 align:start position:0%
senate both agreed to raise it by a
 
02:38:40.150 --> 02:38:40.160 align:start position:0%
million dollars
 
02:38:42.630 --> 02:38:42.640 align:start position:0%
then somewhere along the line i think in
 
02:38:44.230 --> 02:38:44.240 align:start position:0%
the next budget
 
02:38:47.510 --> 02:38:47.520 align:start position:0%
the senate again acting on its own
 
02:38:50.870 --> 02:38:50.880 align:start position:0%
uh put into hb2 that that tax credit
 
02:38:50.880 --> 02:38:51.270 align:start position:0%
uh put into hb2 that that tax credit
would

02:38:51.270 --> 02:38:51.280 align:start position:0%
would
 
02:38:54.070 --> 02:38:54.080 align:start position:0%
be increased by five million dollars and
 
02:38:55.670 --> 02:38:55.680 align:start position:0%
in a bipartisan way
 
02:38:58.630 --> 02:38:58.640 align:start position:0%
on this committee we were not happy with
 
02:38:58.640 --> 02:38:59.190 align:start position:0%
on this committee we were not happy with
that

02:38:59.190 --> 02:38:59.200 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:39:02.550 --> 02:39:02.560 align:start position:0%
we were not happy that they did this
 
02:39:02.560 --> 02:39:03.590 align:start position:0%
we were not happy that they did this
without

02:39:03.590 --> 02:39:03.600 align:start position:0%
without
 
02:39:05.750 --> 02:39:05.760 align:start position:0%
conferring with us again once again they
 
02:39:07.429 --> 02:39:07.439 align:start position:0%
just put it in there
 
02:39:09.110 --> 02:39:09.120 align:start position:0%
and you know it's the magic of hp2 i
 
02:39:12.550 --> 02:39:12.560 align:start position:0%
call it you know things happen in hb2
 
02:39:15.590 --> 02:39:15.600 align:start position:0%
so when it i think the bill came
 
02:39:18.150 --> 02:39:18.160 align:start position:0%
to us about the exemptions and i'm
 
02:39:21.190 --> 02:39:21.200 align:start position:0%
guessing i can't recall exactly but
 
02:39:23.270 --> 02:39:23.280 align:start position:0%
it was it was midterm it was after the
 
02:39:24.790 --> 02:39:24.800 align:start position:0%
budget was set
 
02:39:26.550 --> 02:39:26.560 align:start position:0%
we wanted to do this we thought it would
 
02:39:29.510 --> 02:39:29.520 align:start position:0%
be higher probability of passing
 
02:39:31.990 --> 02:39:32.000 align:start position:0%
if we made it budget neutral because the
 
02:39:32.950 --> 02:39:32.960 align:start position:0%
budget had already been
 
02:39:35.429 --> 02:39:35.439 align:start position:0%
set so we took a bill that came to us
 
02:39:36.309 --> 02:39:36.319 align:start position:0%
probably the second
 
02:39:38.630 --> 02:39:38.640 align:start position:0%
year of the two years and we said let's
 
02:39:40.230 --> 02:39:40.240 align:start position:0%
let's pay for it
 
02:39:42.870 --> 02:39:42.880 align:start position:0%
and that's where the reduction came from
 
02:39:42.880 --> 02:39:43.270 align:start position:0%
and that's where the reduction came from
uh

02:39:43.270 --> 02:39:43.280 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:39:45.429 --> 02:39:45.439 align:start position:0%
but i don't think it passed because it
 
02:39:45.439 --> 02:39:46.870 align:start position:0%
but i don't think it passed because it
didn't

02:39:46.870 --> 02:39:46.880 align:start position:0%
didn't
 
02:39:48.150 --> 02:39:48.160 align:start position:0%
call now but it obviously didn't go
 
02:39:50.550 --> 02:39:50.560 align:start position:0%
anywhere because it's
 
02:39:53.110 --> 02:39:53.120 align:start position:0%
still a seven million dollar tax credit
 
02:39:54.630 --> 02:39:54.640 align:start position:0%
that's kind of the history of it
 
02:39:56.469 --> 02:39:56.479 align:start position:0%
and represent me if you want to jump in
 
02:39:57.750 --> 02:39:57.760 align:start position:0%
to say
 
02:39:59.510 --> 02:39:59.520 align:start position:0%
correct me if i was wrong about some of
 
02:40:02.150 --> 02:40:02.160 align:start position:0%
the feelings we had about
 
02:40:04.710 --> 02:40:04.720 align:start position:0%
going historically i'd appreciate it i
 
02:40:04.720 --> 02:40:05.349 align:start position:0%
going historically i'd appreciate it i
think

02:40:05.349 --> 02:40:05.359 align:start position:0%
think
 
02:40:09.030 --> 02:40:09.040 align:start position:0%
um representative spillsbury was
 
02:40:12.550 --> 02:40:12.560 align:start position:0%
okay next and then we'll go to represent
 
02:40:14.550 --> 02:40:14.560 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman just very briefly
 
02:40:16.070 --> 02:40:16.080 align:start position:0%
i i like um
 
02:40:18.950 --> 02:40:18.960 align:start position:0%
representative olney's request to model
 
02:40:20.309 --> 02:40:20.319 align:start position:0%
the increments
 
02:40:22.309 --> 02:40:22.319 align:start position:0%
uh but i would ask specifically that
 
02:40:24.389 --> 02:40:24.399 align:start position:0%
while dra is doing that
 
02:40:27.110 --> 02:40:27.120 align:start position:0%
that they also model the increments that
 
02:40:29.030 --> 02:40:29.040 align:start position:0%
are proposed in these two bills so
 
02:40:33.110 --> 02:40:33.120 align:start position:0%
in 210 3500
 
02:40:37.429 --> 02:40:37.439 align:start position:0%
and in 568 a progression of 4 800
 
02:40:43.990 --> 02:40:44.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:49.750 --> 02:40:49.760 align:start position:0%
fine devin did you hear that
 
02:40:50.950 --> 02:40:50.960 align:start position:0%
sure thing we'll definitely include that
 
02:40:53.590 --> 02:40:53.600 align:start position:0%
in our analysis okay thanks steven
 
02:40:56.790 --> 02:40:56.800 align:start position:0%

um would you say the last two numbers
 
02:41:11.830 --> 02:41:11.840 align:start position:0%
the last numbers are seven seven eight
 
02:41:16.150 --> 02:41:16.160 align:start position:0%

uh representative ober uh yes just a
 
02:41:56.150 --> 02:41:56.160 align:start position:0%
comment on the past if if you remember i
 
02:41:57.990 --> 02:41:58.000 align:start position:0%
was actually on ways and means when we
 
02:41:59.190 --> 02:41:59.200 align:start position:0%
went through this
 
02:42:02.150 --> 02:42:02.160 align:start position:0%
rigmarole about how to give money away
 
02:42:04.070 --> 02:42:04.080 align:start position:0%
to the people that do tech
 
02:42:06.870 --> 02:42:06.880 align:start position:0%
and we went from one we went to two and
 
02:42:08.710 --> 02:42:08.720 align:start position:0%
it was a big discussion
 
02:42:10.870 --> 02:42:10.880 align:start position:0%
when we went to two million dollars
 
02:42:13.750 --> 02:42:13.760 align:start position:0%
about what are we getting for our money
 
02:42:15.590 --> 02:42:15.600 align:start position:0%
and the the tech companies said well
 
02:42:17.269 --> 02:42:17.279 align:start position:0%
we're going to give you more people
 
02:42:19.269 --> 02:42:19.279 align:start position:0%
we're going to hire people our business
 
02:42:21.110 --> 02:42:21.120 align:start position:0%
is going to expand
 
02:42:23.429 --> 02:42:23.439 align:start position:0%
but we never heard what actually
 
02:42:23.439 --> 02:42:24.309 align:start position:0%
but we never heard what actually
happened

02:42:24.309 --> 02:42:24.319 align:start position:0%
happened
 
02:42:26.550 --> 02:42:26.560 align:start position:0%
and it moved to 7 million without our
 
02:42:27.910 --> 02:42:27.920 align:start position:0%
even knowing about it
 
02:42:30.950 --> 02:42:30.960 align:start position:0%
and we still don't know all those people
 
02:42:32.309 --> 02:42:32.319 align:start position:0%
that are getting this
 
02:42:35.190 --> 02:42:35.200 align:start position:0%
tax deferral we don't know that we're
 
02:42:36.870 --> 02:42:36.880 align:start position:0%
doing anything with that money are they
 
02:42:38.309 --> 02:42:38.319 align:start position:0%
hiring more people
 
02:42:40.230 --> 02:42:40.240 align:start position:0%
is their business expanding are they
 
02:42:41.670 --> 02:42:41.680 align:start position:0%
doing good with that money
 
02:42:43.349 --> 02:42:43.359 align:start position:0%
or are they just saying hey this is free
 
02:42:45.910 --> 02:42:45.920 align:start position:0%
money let's keep going at it
 
02:42:51.670 --> 02:42:51.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:54.950 --> 02:42:54.960 align:start position:0%
i got on the list of questions that need
 
02:43:03.269 --> 02:43:03.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:05.670 --> 02:43:05.680 align:start position:0%
anybody else with questions for the dra
 
02:43:05.680 --> 02:43:06.710 align:start position:0%
anybody else with questions for the dra
or

02:43:06.710 --> 02:43:06.720 align:start position:0%
or
 
02:43:10.070 --> 02:43:10.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:12.870 --> 02:43:12.880 align:start position:0%
i guess this is a question for the dra
 
02:43:13.830 --> 02:43:13.840 align:start position:0%
because we keep
 
02:43:16.230 --> 02:43:16.240 align:start position:0%
getting told by the business and
 
02:43:16.240 --> 02:43:17.349 align:start position:0%
getting told by the business and
economic

02:43:17.349 --> 02:43:17.359 align:start position:0%
economic
 
02:43:20.070 --> 02:43:20.080 align:start position:0%
uh affairs department or whatever it's
 
02:43:21.750 --> 02:43:21.760 align:start position:0%
called now
 
02:43:26.150 --> 02:43:26.160 align:start position:0%
all i know is the eea on that
 
02:43:28.950 --> 02:43:28.960 align:start position:0%
they can't answer us because they don't
 
02:43:31.110 --> 02:43:31.120 align:start position:0%
know who the people who took the credit
 
02:43:33.830 --> 02:43:33.840 align:start position:0%
are and the dra is the only one who
 
02:43:35.750 --> 02:43:35.760 align:start position:0%
knows who took the credit
 
02:43:39.190 --> 02:43:39.200 align:start position:0%
is there some way to be
 
02:43:42.309 --> 02:43:42.319 align:start position:0%
able to get more
 
02:43:45.830 --> 02:43:45.840 align:start position:0%
information about on well
 
02:43:49.110 --> 02:43:49.120 align:start position:0%
what concerns me most is how much our
 
02:43:51.910 --> 02:43:51.920 align:start position:0%
credit is relative to what they get
 
02:43:54.469 --> 02:43:54.479 align:start position:0%
from the federal government and we do
 
02:43:55.670 --> 02:43:55.680 align:start position:0%
know in the case
 
02:43:59.110 --> 02:43:59.120 align:start position:0%
of the uh person in
 
02:44:02.230 --> 02:44:02.240 align:start position:0%
on representative ames district that
 
02:44:05.510 --> 02:44:05.520 align:start position:0%
uh it's about 25 which i thought it
 
02:44:07.269 --> 02:44:07.279 align:start position:0%
would be less than that
 
02:44:11.349 --> 02:44:11.359 align:start position:0%
on and i've been worried that we were
 
02:44:14.150 --> 02:44:14.160 align:start position:0%
just a flea on the tail of the dog
 
02:44:17.349 --> 02:44:17.359 align:start position:0%
and that we were spending money with
 
02:44:20.389 --> 02:44:20.399 align:start position:0%
no real impact and
 
02:44:23.110 --> 02:44:23.120 align:start position:0%
and we've been asking for years for this
 
02:44:23.120 --> 02:44:23.590 align:start position:0%
and we've been asking for years for this
and

02:44:23.590 --> 02:44:23.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:44:26.070 --> 02:44:26.080 align:start position:0%
they haven't they told us that they
 
02:44:27.750 --> 02:44:27.760 align:start position:0%
couldn't reply
 
02:44:30.790 --> 02:44:30.800 align:start position:0%
and i'm hoping dra can figure out
 
02:44:36.150 --> 02:44:36.160 align:start position:0%
some way that discussing it with bea
 
02:44:39.030 --> 02:44:39.040 align:start position:0%
that they could get some responses from
 
02:44:40.550 --> 02:44:40.560 align:start position:0%
some of the people
 
02:44:42.870 --> 02:44:42.880 align:start position:0%
other people that have been involved
 
02:44:43.910 --> 02:44:43.920 align:start position:0%
with this program
 
02:44:45.830 --> 02:44:45.840 align:start position:0%
and what they actually did with the
 
02:44:47.110 --> 02:44:47.120 align:start position:0%
money uh
 
02:44:51.510 --> 02:44:51.520 align:start position:0%
every time we increase uh the credits
 
02:44:55.349 --> 02:44:55.359 align:start position:0%
on more people sign up for it
 
02:44:57.670 --> 02:44:57.680 align:start position:0%
because it's worth more worth the
 
02:44:58.870 --> 02:44:58.880 align:start position:0%
paperwork to them
 
02:45:01.590 --> 02:45:01.600 align:start position:0%
and the original intent was to help the
 
02:45:03.750 --> 02:45:03.760 align:start position:0%
struggling businesses at the bottom
 
02:45:05.910 --> 02:45:05.920 align:start position:0%
that were in research and development
 
02:45:08.550 --> 02:45:08.560 align:start position:0%
and that are the future of our economy
 
02:45:11.830 --> 02:45:11.840 align:start position:0%
thanks this is going to be a separate
 
02:45:11.840 --> 02:45:12.790 align:start position:0%
thanks this is going to be a separate
issue

02:45:12.790 --> 02:45:12.800 align:start position:0%
issue
 
02:45:15.990 --> 02:45:16.000 align:start position:0%
to be able to put our hands around
 
02:45:19.190 --> 02:45:19.200 align:start position:0%
this whole issue of the r d tax credit
 
02:45:22.790 --> 02:45:22.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:25.830 --> 02:45:25.840 align:start position:0%
that were as a result of it
 
02:45:29.269 --> 02:45:29.279 align:start position:0%
what have they done and so
 
02:45:33.190 --> 02:45:33.200 align:start position:0%
we don't have a specific bill for that
 
02:45:36.469 --> 02:45:36.479 align:start position:0%
refers to it in this bill so i'll put
 
02:45:38.630 --> 02:45:38.640 align:start position:0%
something together
 
02:45:41.429 --> 02:45:41.439 align:start position:0%
maybe i have to be an ad hoc committee
 
02:45:45.590 --> 02:45:45.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:48.389 --> 02:45:48.399 align:start position:0%
mr chairman if i could the tax
 
02:45:49.830 --> 02:45:49.840 align:start position:0%
expenditure committee
 
02:45:52.550 --> 02:45:52.560 align:start position:0%
was going to start trying to look at
 
02:45:53.830 --> 02:45:53.840 align:start position:0%
this this year
 
02:45:56.230 --> 02:45:56.240 align:start position:0%
and the senate seems to have decided to
 
02:46:00.630 --> 02:46:00.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:02.870 --> 02:46:02.880 align:start position:0%
it was in last year's one of their big
 
02:46:02.880 --> 02:46:05.030 align:start position:0%
it was in last year's one of their big
bills

02:46:05.030 --> 02:46:05.040 align:start position:0%
bills
 
02:46:07.750 --> 02:46:07.760 align:start position:0%
i do not know who the chairman of the
 
02:46:09.349 --> 02:46:09.359 align:start position:0%
tax expenditure committee that's going
 
02:46:12.150 --> 02:46:12.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:15.190 --> 02:46:15.200 align:start position:0%
representative ames didn't you get put
 
02:46:18.469 --> 02:46:18.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:22.070 --> 02:46:22.080 align:start position:0%
not to my knowledge i had recommended
 
02:46:22.080 --> 02:46:23.590 align:start position:0%
not to my knowledge i had recommended
you

02:46:23.590 --> 02:46:23.600 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:46:27.510 --> 02:46:27.520 align:start position:0%
okay i will find out
 
02:46:31.110 --> 02:46:31.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:33.830 --> 02:46:33.840 align:start position:0%
any further questions on this issue to
 
02:46:36.309 --> 02:46:36.319 align:start position:0%
kind of sum up
 
02:46:39.750 --> 02:46:39.760 align:start position:0%
on house bill 210 i think the vast
 
02:46:39.760 --> 02:46:41.190 align:start position:0%
on house bill 210 i think the vast
majority

02:46:41.190 --> 02:46:41.200 align:start position:0%
majority
 
02:46:45.430 --> 02:46:45.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:45.440 --> 02:46:46.950 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

02:46:46.950 --> 02:46:46.960 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:46:50.230 --> 02:46:50.240 align:start position:0%
divorce the r d development from
 
02:46:54.630 --> 02:46:54.640 align:start position:0%
the interest and dividend credits
 
02:46:57.750 --> 02:46:57.760 align:start position:0%
and uh our question then
 
02:47:01.190 --> 02:47:01.200 align:start position:0%
is on increments of changes from a
 
02:47:02.150 --> 02:47:02.160 align:start position:0%
couple hundred dollars
 
02:47:05.110 --> 02:47:05.120 align:start position:0%
increments what is that going to cost us
 
02:47:08.630 --> 02:47:08.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:11.910 --> 02:47:11.920 align:start position:0%
some people are just persistent
 
02:47:11.920 --> 02:47:15.190 align:start position:0%
some people are just persistent
um

02:47:15.190 --> 02:47:15.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:25.110 --> 02:47:25.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:28.309 --> 02:47:28.319 align:start position:0%
568 is increasing the exemption to the
 
02:47:30.389 --> 02:47:30.399 align:start position:0%
interest and dividend tax
 
02:47:35.110 --> 02:47:35.120 align:start position:0%
until eventually repealing it in 2025
 
02:47:37.510 --> 02:47:37.520 align:start position:0%
it has a lot of the same arguments that
 
02:47:38.469 --> 02:47:38.479 align:start position:0%
we had on
 
02:47:38.479 --> 02:47:41.990 align:start position:0%
we had on
210.

02:47:41.990 --> 02:47:42.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:45.429 --> 02:47:45.439 align:start position:0%
so i'm open to hear
 
02:47:53.670 --> 02:47:53.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:59.590 --> 02:47:59.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:01.990 --> 02:48:02.000 align:start position:0%
it would eventually settle down to about
 
02:48:03.750 --> 02:48:03.760 align:start position:0%
110 million dollar
 
02:48:07.750 --> 02:48:07.760 align:start position:0%
each year to our budget
 
02:48:12.550 --> 02:48:12.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:15.590 --> 02:48:15.600 align:start position:0%
representative southwood i thank you mr
 
02:48:15.600 --> 02:48:16.469 align:start position:0%
representative southwood i thank you mr
chairman

02:48:16.469 --> 02:48:16.479 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
02:48:19.269 --> 02:48:19.279 align:start position:0%
um i'm opposed to this bill again i
 
02:48:19.279 --> 02:48:19.750 align:start position:0%
um i'm opposed to this bill again i
think

02:48:19.750 --> 02:48:19.760 align:start position:0%
think
 
02:48:22.389 --> 02:48:22.399 align:start position:0%
we have too many variables going on and
 
02:48:24.630 --> 02:48:24.640 align:start position:0%
i don't really see an upside to reducing
 
02:48:24.640 --> 02:48:25.590 align:start position:0%
i don't really see an upside to reducing
revenue

02:48:25.590 --> 02:48:25.600 align:start position:0%
revenue
 
02:48:28.070 --> 02:48:28.080 align:start position:0%
um i could give a long spiel but i think
 
02:48:29.670 --> 02:48:29.680 align:start position:0%
to just say briefly
 
02:48:32.469 --> 02:48:32.479 align:start position:0%
my main concern is the result will be
 
02:48:34.070 --> 02:48:34.080 align:start position:0%
downshifting more costs
 
02:48:37.349 --> 02:48:37.359 align:start position:0%
to property taxpayers and i guess the
 
02:48:38.950 --> 02:48:38.960 align:start position:0%
two big things i see
 
02:48:41.110 --> 02:48:41.120 align:start position:0%
happening in the next two years are we
 
02:48:42.790 --> 02:48:42.800 align:start position:0%
don't really know what's happening with
 
02:48:45.269 --> 02:48:45.279 align:start position:0%
meals and rooms tax and we also don't
 
02:48:46.950 --> 02:48:46.960 align:start position:0%
know what exactly is going to happen
 
02:48:49.830 --> 02:48:49.840 align:start position:0%
with public education and those are big
 
02:48:50.870 --> 02:48:50.880 align:start position:0%
big things
 
02:48:53.110 --> 02:48:53.120 align:start position:0%
and uh you know i'm not sure it's a time
 
02:48:54.070 --> 02:48:54.080 align:start position:0%
to cut revenue
 
02:48:57.510 --> 02:48:57.520 align:start position:0%
thank you and if we don't know
 
02:49:01.190 --> 02:49:01.200 align:start position:0%
if the vast majority we don't know the
 
02:49:02.790 --> 02:49:02.800 align:start position:0%
answers of these questions
 
02:49:05.910 --> 02:49:05.920 align:start position:0%
yes mean that we need to
 
02:49:09.990 --> 02:49:10.000 align:start position:0%
either retain it or i tell it
 
02:49:12.790 --> 02:49:12.800 align:start position:0%
but i would i would report retention
 
02:49:14.389 --> 02:49:14.399 align:start position:0%
except i don't think we're going to know
 
02:49:15.190 --> 02:49:15.200 align:start position:0%
much about
 
02:49:17.830 --> 02:49:17.840 align:start position:0%
covet and some of that within one year
 
02:49:19.750 --> 02:49:19.760 align:start position:0%
let's hear from somebody else uh
 
02:49:21.590 --> 02:49:21.600 align:start position:0%
representative brownlee followed by
 
02:49:23.830 --> 02:49:23.840 align:start position:0%
representative elmer
 
02:49:26.950 --> 02:49:26.960 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um i'm for i'm
 
02:49:28.550 --> 02:49:28.560 align:start position:0%
personally not in favor of
 
02:49:31.429 --> 02:49:31.439 align:start position:0%
the the uh the end point uh with the
 
02:49:33.750 --> 02:49:33.760 align:start position:0%
total reduction of this tax
 
02:49:35.670 --> 02:49:35.680 align:start position:0%
uh this is something we're working
 
02:49:37.510 --> 02:49:37.520 align:start position:0%
through in our caucus
 
02:49:40.550 --> 02:49:40.560 align:start position:0%
and uh we're working on it and that's
 
02:49:42.950 --> 02:49:42.960 align:start position:0%
why i i viewed the two bills the 210 and
 
02:49:44.230 --> 02:49:44.240 align:start position:0%
this together
 
02:49:46.630 --> 02:49:46.640 align:start position:0%
somehow we got to combine these two and
 
02:49:46.640 --> 02:49:47.670 align:start position:0%
somehow we got to combine these two and
uh

02:49:47.670 --> 02:49:47.680 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:49:51.269 --> 02:49:51.279 align:start position:0%
come up with a strategy that uh at least
 
02:49:53.910 --> 02:49:53.920 align:start position:0%
you know that we can agree to we may not
 
02:49:53.920 --> 02:49:54.309 align:start position:0%
you know that we can agree to we may not
we

02:49:54.309 --> 02:49:54.319 align:start position:0%
we
 
02:49:55.750 --> 02:49:55.760 align:start position:0%
may not come to a total agreement
 
02:49:57.910 --> 02:49:57.920 align:start position:0%
between the caucuses
 
02:50:01.269 --> 02:50:01.279 align:start position:0%
but um again i i think
 
02:50:04.230 --> 02:50:04.240 align:start position:0%
eliminating 111 million dollars in a
 
02:50:06.710 --> 02:50:06.720 align:start position:0%
couple of years of revenue
 
02:50:08.950 --> 02:50:08.960 align:start position:0%
um that's a that's a hard one to just
 
02:50:10.309 --> 02:50:10.319 align:start position:0%
follow for me
 
02:50:13.830 --> 02:50:13.840 align:start position:0%
uh and i think it's a different dynamic
 
02:50:15.750 --> 02:50:15.760 align:start position:0%
than the business tax cuts and uh we
 
02:50:17.269 --> 02:50:17.279 align:start position:0%
could talk about that at some other time
 
02:50:17.279 --> 02:50:18.230 align:start position:0%
could talk about that at some other time
but

02:50:18.230 --> 02:50:18.240 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:50:20.309 --> 02:50:20.319 align:start position:0%
um i don't think it'll work the same way
 
02:50:22.150 --> 02:50:22.160 align:start position:0%
as business tax cuts
 
02:50:24.150 --> 02:50:24.160 align:start position:0%
so in terms of generating more revenue
 
02:50:25.349 --> 02:50:25.359 align:start position:0%
than uh
 
02:50:27.670 --> 02:50:27.680 align:start position:0%
than not so that's that's where i
 
02:50:29.349 --> 02:50:29.359 align:start position:0%
personally stand on it and uh
 
02:50:32.630 --> 02:50:32.640 align:start position:0%
we'll be working in our caucus uh to
 
02:50:34.469 --> 02:50:34.479 align:start position:0%
come up with some some kind of a
 
02:50:36.790 --> 02:50:36.800 align:start position:0%
strategy here thank you
 
02:50:40.070 --> 02:50:40.080 align:start position:0%
representative alamed
 
02:50:44.710 --> 02:50:44.720 align:start position:0%
thank you on this is 225 million
 
02:50:48.309 --> 02:50:48.319 align:start position:0%
a year uh a biennium for our biennial
 
02:50:48.319 --> 02:50:48.870 align:start position:0%
a year uh a biennium for our biennial
budget

02:50:48.870 --> 02:50:48.880 align:start position:0%
budget
 
02:50:52.070 --> 02:50:52.080 align:start position:0%
it is a very significant amount of money
 
02:50:55.349 --> 02:50:55.359 align:start position:0%
on we don't know
 
02:50:58.550 --> 02:50:58.560 align:start position:0%
can you hear me yeah would you say 225
 
02:50:58.560 --> 02:51:00.070 align:start position:0%
can you hear me yeah would you say 225
million

02:51:00.070 --> 02:51:00.080 align:start position:0%
million
 
02:51:05.670 --> 02:51:05.680 align:start position:0%
on per biennium it's 225
 
02:51:08.389 --> 02:51:08.399 align:start position:0%
and on we don't know where that would
 
02:51:09.590 --> 02:51:09.600 align:start position:0%
come from
 
02:51:12.070 --> 02:51:12.080 align:start position:0%
we wouldn't maybe we could we would
 
02:51:13.670 --> 02:51:13.680 align:start position:0%
would have to cut
 
02:51:15.990 --> 02:51:16.000 align:start position:0%
on the community colleges and training
 
02:51:19.110 --> 02:51:19.120 align:start position:0%
programs on which our economy depends
 
02:51:20.630 --> 02:51:20.640 align:start position:0%
maybe we would have to we would
 
02:51:22.309 --> 02:51:22.319 align:start position:0%
certainly be
 
02:51:23.910 --> 02:51:23.920 align:start position:0%
given the way people have been in the
 
02:51:26.550 --> 02:51:26.560 align:start position:0%
past be cutting out the substance abuse
 
02:51:29.190 --> 02:51:29.200 align:start position:0%
programs that our businesses depend on
 
02:51:30.790 --> 02:51:30.800 align:start position:0%
at least in my community the business
 
02:51:32.870 --> 02:51:32.880 align:start position:0%
businesses sure depend on it
 
02:51:36.070 --> 02:51:36.080 align:start position:0%
um and on there
 
02:51:39.990 --> 02:51:40.000 align:start position:0%
are the the courts would suffer
 
02:51:43.510 --> 02:51:43.520 align:start position:0%
we would have longer waits in the courts
 
02:51:44.389 --> 02:51:44.399 align:start position:0%
the courts are
 
02:51:47.670 --> 02:51:47.680 align:start position:0%
already heavily backed up
 
02:51:50.389 --> 02:51:50.399 align:start position:0%
before covid they were heavily backed up
 
02:51:52.870 --> 02:51:52.880 align:start position:0%
there's a whole range of government
 
02:51:52.880 --> 02:51:53.750 align:start position:0%
there's a whole range of government
services

02:51:53.750 --> 02:51:53.760 align:start position:0%
services
 
02:51:57.590 --> 02:51:57.600 align:start position:0%
that both our families and our
 
02:52:01.590 --> 02:52:01.600 align:start position:0%
our businesses depend on
 
02:52:05.269 --> 02:52:05.279 align:start position:0%
we cannot in this then the modern age
 
02:52:08.230 --> 02:52:08.240 align:start position:0%
run a government with no i mean run a
 
02:52:08.240 --> 02:52:08.870 align:start position:0%
run a government with no i mean run a
state

02:52:08.870 --> 02:52:08.880 align:start position:0%
state
 
02:52:12.550 --> 02:52:12.560 align:start position:0%
have a state or a nation
 
02:52:15.830 --> 02:52:15.840 align:start position:0%
without a government anarchy is not
 
02:52:19.480 --> 02:52:19.490 align:start position:0%
an option so i really
 
02:52:19.490 --> 02:52:20.790 align:start position:0%
an option so i really
[Music]

02:52:20.790 --> 02:52:20.800 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:52:24.070 --> 02:52:24.080 align:start position:0%
am totally opposed to
 
02:52:27.190 --> 02:52:27.200 align:start position:0%
further cuts in an already very closely
 
02:52:27.200 --> 02:52:28.550 align:start position:0%
further cuts in an already very closely
budgeted

02:52:28.550 --> 02:52:28.560 align:start position:0%
budgeted
 
02:52:33.190 --> 02:52:33.200 align:start position:0%
state thank you thank you representative
 
02:52:40.070 --> 02:52:40.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:44.389 --> 02:52:44.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:47.510 --> 02:52:47.520 align:start position:0%
time table yeah
 
02:52:49.429 --> 02:52:49.439 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i was slow to get to the
 
02:52:51.750 --> 02:52:51.760 align:start position:0%
unmute button
 
02:52:53.110 --> 02:52:53.120 align:start position:0%
there but i just wanted to point out
 
02:52:58.950 --> 02:52:58.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:01.349 --> 02:53:01.359 align:start position:0%
if you look at dra's annual report
 
02:53:03.269 --> 02:53:03.279 align:start position:0%
you'll see that
 
02:53:06.389 --> 02:53:06.399 align:start position:0%
that we first had uh tax on interest and
 
02:53:16.870 --> 02:53:16.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:20.070 --> 02:53:20.080 align:start position:0%
yes okay am i back on board
 
02:53:23.269 --> 02:53:23.279 align:start position:0%
yes gotta watch out for this cursor
 
02:53:26.790 --> 02:53:26.800 align:start position:0%
so this is a long-standing uh tax and
 
02:53:29.830 --> 02:53:29.840 align:start position:0%
it began in 1923
 
02:53:33.510 --> 02:53:33.520 align:start position:0%
and according to the dra annual report
 
02:53:38.389 --> 02:53:38.399 align:start position:0%
it was in 1964
 
02:53:41.429 --> 02:53:41.439 align:start position:0%
i think they make there's a typo here
 
02:53:44.550 --> 02:53:44.560 align:start position:0%
um could have been 75
 
02:53:48.070 --> 02:53:48.080 align:start position:0%
when the rate of 5 was settled upon
 
02:53:51.349 --> 02:53:51.359 align:start position:0%
so it's been at that 5 rate
 
02:53:54.120 --> 02:53:54.130 align:start position:0%
at least since 1975
 
02:53:54.130 --> 02:53:55.190 align:start position:0%
at least since 1975
[Music]

02:53:55.190 --> 02:53:55.200 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:53:58.710 --> 02:53:58.720 align:start position:0%
and it's as a steady
 
02:54:02.469 --> 02:54:02.479 align:start position:0%
part of our revenue structure i see no
 
02:54:05.990 --> 02:54:06.000 align:start position:0%
reason to to change that
 
02:54:08.790 --> 02:54:08.800 align:start position:0%
now and i hope will take i i hope that
 
02:54:10.070 --> 02:54:10.080 align:start position:0%
we'll reject
 
02:54:14.150 --> 02:54:14.160 align:start position:0%
uh that part of the bill thank you
 
02:54:17.910 --> 02:54:17.920 align:start position:0%
thank you representative ames uh
 
02:54:21.910 --> 02:54:21.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:23.750 --> 02:54:23.760 align:start position:0%
mr chairman a very quick question does
 
02:54:24.950 --> 02:54:24.960 align:start position:0%
anyone know
 
02:54:31.750 --> 02:54:31.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:35.190 --> 02:54:35.200 align:start position:0%
i just set it open the lba
 
02:54:39.510 --> 02:54:39.520 align:start position:0%
report should tell you that
 
02:54:42.790 --> 02:54:42.800 align:start position:0%
uh how about devin or melissa
 
02:54:44.790 --> 02:54:44.800 align:start position:0%
would you know the answer to that thank
 
02:54:45.990 --> 02:54:46.000 align:start position:0%
you chairman members with me this is
 
02:54:47.750 --> 02:54:47.760 align:start position:0%
devin roderick department of revenue
 
02:54:49.429 --> 02:54:49.439 align:start position:0%
going off of that annual our annual
 
02:54:51.590 --> 02:54:51.600 align:start position:0%
report from fiscal year 2020
 
02:54:52.950 --> 02:54:52.960 align:start position:0%
that representative ames was mentioning
 
02:54:55.830 --> 02:54:55.840 align:start position:0%
a minute ago the um
 
02:54:58.870 --> 02:54:58.880 align:start position:0%
exemption was increased to 1200 in
 
02:55:02.070 --> 02:55:02.080 align:start position:0%
1981 and then
 
02:55:05.190 --> 02:55:05.200 align:start position:0%
the threshold was increased to
 
02:55:08.790 --> 02:55:08.800 align:start position:0%
um twenty four hundred dollars um
 
02:55:12.150 --> 02:55:12.160 align:start position:0%
shortly thereafter so
 
02:55:17.429 --> 02:55:17.439 align:start position:0%
the effective date of that was
 
02:55:22.389 --> 02:55:22.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:24.790 --> 02:55:24.800 align:start position:0%
you're saying that the 2400 has been in
 
02:55:28.550 --> 02:55:28.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:30.150 --> 02:55:30.160 align:start position:0%
i wasn't around them but i believe based
 
02:55:32.790 --> 02:55:32.800 align:start position:0%
on my interpretation i believe so yes
 
02:55:42.830 --> 02:55:42.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:42.840 --> 02:55:45.269 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:55:45.269 --> 02:55:45.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:55:48.870 --> 02:55:48.880 align:start position:0%
do you have any further questions
 
02:55:53.830 --> 02:55:53.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:56.790 --> 02:55:56.800 align:start position:0%
represent bernstein thank you thank you
 
02:55:57.670 --> 02:55:57.680 align:start position:0%
mr chair
 
02:56:00.230 --> 02:56:00.240 align:start position:0%
just to to layer add a layer onto
 
02:56:01.750 --> 02:56:01.760 align:start position:0%
representative spillsbury's
 
02:56:04.790 --> 02:56:04.800 align:start position:0%
last comments if you go to the
 
02:56:07.110 --> 02:56:07.120 align:start position:0%
us bureau of labor statistics they have
 
02:56:07.990 --> 02:56:08.000 align:start position:0%
a cpi
 
02:56:11.750 --> 02:56:11.760 align:start position:0%
calculator now um and if you plug in a
 
02:56:11.760 --> 02:56:13.190 align:start position:0%
calculator now um and if you plug in a
2400

02:56:13.190 --> 02:56:13.200 align:start position:0%
2400
 
02:56:17.269 --> 02:56:17.279 align:start position:0%
exemption from july of 1981
 
02:56:20.389 --> 02:56:20.399 align:start position:0%
that would be equivalent to a 6800
 
02:56:23.110 --> 02:56:23.120 align:start position:0%
it would be equivalent to over 6 800
 
02:56:23.120 --> 02:56:24.630 align:start position:0%
it would be equivalent to over 6 800
today

02:56:24.630 --> 02:56:24.640 align:start position:0%
today
 
02:56:28.070 --> 02:56:28.080 align:start position:0%
so if the intent of this tax was to
 
02:56:29.269 --> 02:56:29.279 align:start position:0%
capture a certain
 
02:56:32.710 --> 02:56:32.720 align:start position:0%
um economic
 
02:56:36.309 --> 02:56:36.319 align:start position:0%
tier then we haven't
 
02:56:39.110 --> 02:56:39.120 align:start position:0%
adjusted this for inflation and um just
 
02:56:40.070 --> 02:56:40.080 align:start position:0%
the bottom line is
 
02:56:45.269 --> 02:56:45.279 align:start position:0%
2400 in 1981 is equal to 6850
 
02:56:48.870 --> 02:56:48.880 align:start position:0%
today i'll just ask you to consider that
 
02:56:52.309 --> 02:56:52.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:55.830 --> 02:56:55.840 align:start position:0%
thank you uh
 
02:56:58.870 --> 02:56:58.880 align:start position:0%
representative elmi
 
02:57:02.070 --> 02:57:02.080 align:start position:0%
thank you this is why uh this tax is
 
02:57:03.110 --> 02:57:03.120 align:start position:0%
very difficult
 
02:57:06.230 --> 02:57:06.240 align:start position:0%
for my caucus when the interest and
 
02:57:08.070 --> 02:57:08.080 align:start position:0%
dividends tax was created
 
02:57:12.550 --> 02:57:12.560 align:start position:0%
somewhere around 1913 uh or 17
 
02:57:16.550 --> 02:57:16.560 align:start position:0%
on it was meant to tax the people
 
02:57:20.309 --> 02:57:20.319 align:start position:0%
who were fairly wealthy
 
02:57:23.030 --> 02:57:23.040 align:start position:0%
because they were the only ones with
 
02:57:23.040 --> 02:57:23.830 align:start position:0%
because they were the only ones with
dividends

02:57:23.830 --> 02:57:23.840 align:start position:0%
dividends
 
02:57:27.030 --> 02:57:27.040 align:start position:0%
and interest in the bank on
 
02:57:30.230 --> 02:57:30.240 align:start position:0%
and it has over time as things have
 
02:57:32.070 --> 02:57:32.080 align:start position:0%
changed it has come
 
02:57:35.830 --> 02:57:35.840 align:start position:0%
to to uh
 
02:57:39.190 --> 02:57:39.200 align:start position:0%
a large number of people that
 
02:57:42.469 --> 02:57:42.479 align:start position:0%
really uh don't
 
02:57:46.469 --> 02:57:46.479 align:start position:0%
don't have very much money to live on
 
02:57:49.990 --> 02:57:50.000 align:start position:0%
but it is also a
 
02:57:53.910 --> 02:57:53.920 align:start position:0%
significant part of our tax structure
 
02:57:57.750 --> 02:57:57.760 align:start position:0%
and does tax on
 
02:58:00.230 --> 02:58:00.240 align:start position:0%
a lot of people who have a huge amount
 
02:58:01.510 --> 02:58:01.520 align:start position:0%
of money to live on
 
02:58:04.950 --> 02:58:04.960 align:start position:0%
in their old age so
 
02:58:07.990 --> 02:58:08.000 align:start position:0%
it's a very difficult issue i agree
 
02:58:10.950 --> 02:58:10.960 align:start position:0%
but we would have to find a replacement
 
02:58:12.150 --> 02:58:12.160 align:start position:0%
for the revenue
 
02:58:15.429 --> 02:58:15.439 align:start position:0%
or it would go on the local property tax
 
02:58:17.670 --> 02:58:17.680 align:start position:0%
for as part of it and another part of it
 
02:58:19.670 --> 02:58:19.680 align:start position:0%
would be services disappearing
 
02:58:21.269 --> 02:58:21.279 align:start position:0%
that both the businesses and the
 
02:58:23.030 --> 02:58:23.040 align:start position:0%
citizens need
 
02:58:27.990 --> 02:58:28.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:32.150 --> 02:58:32.160 align:start position:0%
representative tucker uh yes i had
 
02:58:35.830 --> 02:58:35.840 align:start position:0%
um a concern when
 
02:58:38.630 --> 02:58:38.640 align:start position:0%
uh members of both caucuses have been
 
02:58:40.230 --> 02:58:40.240 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
02:58:42.150 --> 02:58:42.160 align:start position:0%
dealing with this issue within their
 
02:58:43.910 --> 02:58:43.920 align:start position:0%
caucus because
 
02:58:47.190 --> 02:58:47.200 align:start position:0%
i think this issue
 
02:58:49.990 --> 02:58:50.000 align:start position:0%
is one that we we need to hear each
 
02:58:51.510 --> 02:58:51.520 align:start position:0%
other's views
 
02:58:54.389 --> 02:58:54.399 align:start position:0%
as just this conversation has been going
 
02:58:54.399 --> 02:58:55.349 align:start position:0%
as just this conversation has been going
on

02:58:55.349 --> 02:58:55.359 align:start position:0%
on
 
02:58:59.110 --> 02:58:59.120 align:start position:0%
we've learned new facts about how long
 
02:59:01.110 --> 02:59:01.120 align:start position:0%
exemption have been in place how long
 
02:59:03.110 --> 02:59:03.120 align:start position:0%
the tax has been in place
 
02:59:08.630 --> 02:59:08.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:11.510 --> 02:59:11.520 align:start position:0%
both caucuses to be able to individual
 
02:59:11.520 --> 02:59:12.309 align:start position:0%
both caucuses to be able to individual
members

02:59:12.309 --> 02:59:12.319 align:start position:0%
members
 
02:59:14.230 --> 02:59:14.240 align:start position:0%
to be able to raise questions and
 
02:59:14.240 --> 02:59:15.429 align:start position:0%
to be able to raise questions and
concerns

02:59:15.429 --> 02:59:15.439 align:start position:0%
concerns
 
02:59:18.389 --> 02:59:18.399 align:start position:0%
i think it's a really difficult issue
 
02:59:18.399 --> 02:59:19.269 align:start position:0%
i think it's a really difficult issue
and

02:59:19.269 --> 02:59:19.279 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:59:22.550 --> 02:59:22.560 align:start position:0%
we all need to hear each other i hope
 
02:59:24.710 --> 02:59:24.720 align:start position:0%
this is what we're doing right now
 
02:59:28.150 --> 02:59:28.160 align:start position:0%
yes i think we are
 
02:59:28.160 --> 02:59:34.870 align:start position:0%
yes i think we are
um

02:59:34.870 --> 02:59:34.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:36.990 --> 02:59:37.000 align:start position:0%
representative bromley followed by
 
02:59:37.000 --> 02:59:39.750 align:start position:0%
representative bromley followed by
representatives

02:59:39.750 --> 02:59:39.760 align:start position:0%
representatives
 
02:59:41.429 --> 02:59:41.439 align:start position:0%
my comment about our caucus still
 
02:59:42.870 --> 02:59:42.880 align:start position:0%
working together on this is
 
02:59:45.830 --> 02:59:45.840 align:start position:0%
i i'm assuming you're doing the same on
 
02:59:49.110 --> 02:59:49.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:50.550 --> 02:59:50.560 align:start position:0%
it's just so that we can come to some
 
02:59:52.389 --> 02:59:52.399 align:start position:0%
kind of a consensus among ourselves
 
02:59:56.389 --> 02:59:56.399 align:start position:0%
to pose to the larger group here uh and
 
02:59:57.590 --> 02:59:57.600 align:start position:0%
i'm sure all of the
 
02:59:59.269 --> 02:59:59.279 align:start position:0%
all of the comments are gonna come out
 
03:00:00.309 --> 03:00:00.319 align:start position:0%
eventually i'm sure we're gonna have
 
03:00:01.990 --> 03:00:02.000 align:start position:0%
another discussion on this
 
03:00:05.269 --> 03:00:05.279 align:start position:0%
this bill uh in another work session and
 
03:00:08.389 --> 03:00:08.399 align:start position:0%
uh i'll just leave it at that yes we're
 
03:00:09.990 --> 03:00:10.000 align:start position:0%
for open discussion no question
 
03:00:11.830 --> 03:00:11.840 align:start position:0%
and i think we may want to open it up
 
03:00:13.110 --> 03:00:13.120 align:start position:0%
we'll have it we'll have a full
 
03:00:14.550 --> 03:00:14.560 align:start position:0%
discussion right now but
 
03:00:18.230 --> 03:00:18.240 align:start position:0%
uh but i'll leave it at that thank you
 
03:00:21.750 --> 03:00:21.760 align:start position:0%
representative thank you mr chair
 
03:00:25.190 --> 03:00:25.200 align:start position:0%
um my comments are in response to
 
03:00:26.870 --> 03:00:26.880 align:start position:0%
representative almi's
 
03:00:29.990 --> 03:00:30.000 align:start position:0%
um recent comments and i i hope i can
 
03:00:31.990 --> 03:00:32.000 align:start position:0%
say this without sounding snarky or
 
03:00:33.429 --> 03:00:33.439 align:start position:0%
disrespectful because i
 
03:00:36.870 --> 03:00:36.880 align:start position:0%
i truly admire representative army and
 
03:00:39.510 --> 03:00:39.520 align:start position:0%
um she brings a lot to the table and i
 
03:00:41.269 --> 03:00:41.279 align:start position:0%
know how hard she's worked for the
 
03:00:46.550 --> 03:00:46.560 align:start position:0%
i i love you but it seems like
 
03:00:50.150 --> 03:00:50.160 align:start position:0%
reducing government resources is totally
 
03:00:51.429 --> 03:00:51.439 align:start position:0%
off the table
 
03:00:54.309 --> 03:00:54.319 align:start position:0%
in your opinion you know this pandemic
 
03:00:55.349 --> 03:00:55.359 align:start position:0%
has caused
 
03:00:57.830 --> 03:00:57.840 align:start position:0%
every household in new hampshire to
 
03:00:58.790 --> 03:00:58.800 align:start position:0%
scale back
 
03:01:01.830 --> 03:01:01.840 align:start position:0%
and live within its means this pandemic
 
03:01:04.469 --> 03:01:04.479 align:start position:0%
has asked every business in new
 
03:01:06.150 --> 03:01:06.160 align:start position:0%
hampshire to do the same thing to make
 
03:01:09.590 --> 03:01:09.600 align:start position:0%
tremendous sacrifices
 
03:01:11.910 --> 03:01:11.920 align:start position:0%
i i don't see where it should be off the
 
03:01:14.309 --> 03:01:14.319 align:start position:0%
table to ask the government to cut back
 
03:01:17.990 --> 03:01:18.000 align:start position:0%
as as well so i'm i'm not saying
 
03:01:21.110 --> 03:01:21.120 align:start position:0%
um i'm just saying that that should be
 
03:01:21.830 --> 03:01:21.840 align:start position:0%
in the
 
03:01:24.870 --> 03:01:24.880 align:start position:0%
array of possibilities that perhaps
 
03:01:25.750 --> 03:01:25.760 align:start position:0%
since we've asked
 
03:01:28.070 --> 03:01:28.080 align:start position:0%
every household and every business to
 
03:01:29.750 --> 03:01:29.760 align:start position:0%
scale back a little bit to tighten their
 
03:01:31.750 --> 03:01:31.760 align:start position:0%
belt to sacrifice
 
03:01:33.429 --> 03:01:33.439 align:start position:0%
but it's not out of the question it's
 
03:01:35.110 --> 03:01:35.120 align:start position:0%
not beyond the pale
 
03:01:36.950 --> 03:01:36.960 align:start position:0%
to ask the state government to do the
 
03:01:38.950 --> 03:01:38.960 align:start position:0%
same thing
 
03:01:41.190 --> 03:01:41.200 align:start position:0%
that sounded pretty respectful didn't it
 
03:01:42.230 --> 03:01:42.240 align:start position:0%
that's all right
 
03:01:45.670 --> 03:01:45.680 align:start position:0%
thank you could i reply
 
03:01:48.790 --> 03:01:48.800 align:start position:0%
represent railway thank you on
 
03:01:51.910 --> 03:01:51.920 align:start position:0%
i think we're looking at different sides
 
03:01:55.670 --> 03:01:55.680 align:start position:0%
of the problem on and
 
03:01:59.750 --> 03:01:59.760 align:start position:0%
the side that i'm trying that
 
03:02:02.469 --> 03:02:02.479 align:start position:0%
i and the i think the others in my
 
03:02:04.870 --> 03:02:04.880 align:start position:0%
caucus are trying to look at
 
03:02:07.910 --> 03:02:07.920 align:start position:0%
is that the government is not
 
03:02:11.110 --> 03:02:11.120 align:start position:0%
providing services that
 
03:02:14.469 --> 03:02:14.479 align:start position:0%
are unneeded and the people
 
03:02:17.750 --> 03:02:17.760 align:start position:0%
that benefit from those services are
 
03:02:20.150 --> 03:02:20.160 align:start position:0%
the same people that you're trying to
 
03:02:20.160 --> 03:02:21.510 align:start position:0%
the same people that you're trying to
get

03:02:21.510 --> 03:02:21.520 align:start position:0%
get
 
03:02:24.790 --> 03:02:24.800 align:start position:0%
more money to by cutting the resources
 
03:02:28.830 --> 03:02:28.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:32.070 --> 03:02:32.080 align:start position:0%
it's it's because we do
 
03:02:36.630 --> 03:02:36.640 align:start position:0%
budget so closely in this state
 
03:02:40.790 --> 03:02:40.800 align:start position:0%
on and we we frequently don't invest
 
03:02:43.110 --> 03:02:43.120 align:start position:0%
enough in the future because it would
 
03:02:45.349 --> 03:02:45.359 align:start position:0%
cost money now
 
03:02:48.630 --> 03:02:48.640 align:start position:0%
to be able to make things more efficient
 
03:02:51.910 --> 03:02:51.920 align:start position:0%
in the future but we also
 
03:02:54.469 --> 03:02:54.479 align:start position:0%
cut out services and i've seen many
 
03:02:54.479 --> 03:02:55.190 align:start position:0%
cut out services and i've seen many
services

03:02:55.190 --> 03:02:55.200 align:start position:0%
services
 
03:02:59.110 --> 03:02:59.120 align:start position:0%
cut out in my 25 years since i came home
 
03:03:02.230 --> 03:03:02.240 align:start position:0%
and joined the legislature on
 
03:03:05.110 --> 03:03:05.120 align:start position:0%
we cut out services that make things
 
03:03:05.120 --> 03:03:06.550 align:start position:0%
we cut out services that make things
harder

03:03:06.550 --> 03:03:06.560 align:start position:0%
harder
 
03:03:08.710 --> 03:03:08.720 align:start position:0%
for the families that make things harder
 
03:03:11.750 --> 03:03:11.760 align:start position:0%
for for the employees of businesses and
 
03:03:13.269 --> 03:03:13.279 align:start position:0%
that make things harder for the
 
03:03:13.279 --> 03:03:14.150 align:start position:0%
that make things harder for the
businesses

03:03:14.150 --> 03:03:14.160 align:start position:0%
businesses
 
03:03:16.950 --> 03:03:16.960 align:start position:0%
themselves because there is so much
 
03:03:18.230 --> 03:03:18.240 align:start position:0%
within our budget
 
03:03:20.870 --> 03:03:20.880 align:start position:0%
that is mandated either by our
 
03:03:20.880 --> 03:03:21.830 align:start position:0%
that is mandated either by our
constitution

03:03:21.830 --> 03:03:21.840 align:start position:0%
constitution
 
03:03:25.030 --> 03:03:25.040 align:start position:0%
or by the federal government or
 
03:03:27.590 --> 03:03:27.600 align:start position:0%
or just by the fact that the citizens
 
03:03:29.190 --> 03:03:29.200 align:start position:0%
have had this for a long time
 
03:03:32.630 --> 03:03:32.640 align:start position:0%
and they they get really upset when it
 
03:03:32.640 --> 03:03:33.670 align:start position:0%
and they they get really upset when it
disappears

03:03:33.670 --> 03:03:33.680 align:start position:0%
disappears
 
03:03:35.830 --> 03:03:35.840 align:start position:0%
and that's why a lot of it a lot of
 
03:03:38.070 --> 03:03:38.080 align:start position:0%
those services when you cut them out at
 
03:03:39.190 --> 03:03:39.200 align:start position:0%
the state level
 
03:03:42.870 --> 03:03:42.880 align:start position:0%
shift down to the towns and have to be
 
03:03:44.950 --> 03:03:44.960 align:start position:0%
paid for there or they're going to lose
 
03:03:44.960 --> 03:03:46.950 align:start position:0%
paid for there or they're going to lose
them

03:03:46.950 --> 03:03:46.960 align:start position:0%
them
 
03:03:50.550 --> 03:03:50.560 align:start position:0%
that's sorry that's being respectful
 
03:03:52.870 --> 03:03:52.880 align:start position:0%
back i really appreciate your
 
03:03:54.790 --> 03:03:54.800 align:start position:0%
your intelligence and thought to these
 
03:03:54.800 --> 03:03:56.150 align:start position:0%
your intelligence and thought to these
things

03:03:56.150 --> 03:03:56.160 align:start position:0%
things
 
03:03:59.510 --> 03:03:59.520 align:start position:0%
representative murphy thank you chairman
 
03:04:02.710 --> 03:04:02.720 align:start position:0%
um i just want to you know
 
03:04:04.950 --> 03:04:04.960 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to synthesize representative
 
03:04:06.790 --> 03:04:06.800 align:start position:0%
bernstein's opinion
 
03:04:10.309 --> 03:04:10.319 align:start position:0%
versus uh representative all me
 
03:04:12.790 --> 03:04:12.800 align:start position:0%
and as i look at it i don't look at it
 
03:04:12.800 --> 03:04:13.429 align:start position:0%
and as i look at it i don't look at it
as

03:04:13.429 --> 03:04:13.439 align:start position:0%
as
 
03:04:16.870 --> 03:04:16.880 align:start position:0%
the democrats simply wanting to
 
03:04:19.269 --> 03:04:19.279 align:start position:0%
you know spend money unnecessarily nor
 
03:04:21.429 --> 03:04:21.439 align:start position:0%
the republicans solely wanting to cut
 
03:04:22.790 --> 03:04:22.800 align:start position:0%
all taxes
 
03:04:25.590 --> 03:04:25.600 align:start position:0%
there is a middle ground when you live
 
03:04:26.710 --> 03:04:26.720 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire
 
03:04:28.630 --> 03:04:28.640 align:start position:0%
for as many years as i have over five
 
03:04:30.710 --> 03:04:30.720 align:start position:0%
decades and have taken care of people in
 
03:04:31.910 --> 03:04:31.920 align:start position:0%
the state for over
 
03:04:35.670 --> 03:04:35.680 align:start position:0%
four decades you come to realize
 
03:04:37.670 --> 03:04:37.680 align:start position:0%
that the services we're providing at the
 
03:04:39.030 --> 03:04:39.040 align:start position:0%
state level are
 
03:04:41.990 --> 03:04:42.000 align:start position:0%
significant and even not enough at this
 
03:04:43.030 --> 03:04:43.040 align:start position:0%
point and beyond
 
03:04:44.790 --> 03:04:44.800 align:start position:0%
school and education which we all
 
03:04:44.800 --> 03:04:46.230 align:start position:0%
school and education which we all
discuss

03:04:46.230 --> 03:04:46.240 align:start position:0%
discuss
 
03:04:48.150 --> 03:04:48.160 align:start position:0%
i was listening to west central last
 
03:04:48.160 --> 03:04:49.429 align:start position:0%
i was listening to west central last
night

03:04:49.429 --> 03:04:49.439 align:start position:0%
night
 
03:04:52.550 --> 03:04:52.560 align:start position:0%
in the state we have the third highest
 
03:04:55.429 --> 03:04:55.439 align:start position:0%
overdose rate in the country
 
03:04:58.630 --> 03:04:58.640 align:start position:0%
we have uh
 
03:05:00.309 --> 03:05:00.319 align:start position:0%
the number we're the number one state in
 
03:05:02.230 --> 03:05:02.240 align:start position:0%
alcohol consumption
 
03:05:05.190 --> 03:05:05.200 align:start position:0%
as a result of that there is right now
 
03:05:07.830 --> 03:05:07.840 align:start position:0%
one in five people in this state
 
03:05:10.230 --> 03:05:10.240 align:start position:0%
suffer from anxiety or depression so
 
03:05:11.910 --> 03:05:11.920 align:start position:0%
what i'm getting at is that the services
 
03:05:13.590 --> 03:05:13.600 align:start position:0%
that we provide
 
03:05:16.070 --> 03:05:16.080 align:start position:0%
are mental health which is under duress
 
03:05:17.269 --> 03:05:17.279 align:start position:0%
right now
 
03:05:19.349 --> 03:05:19.359 align:start position:0%
in the emergency room last year we were
 
03:05:20.870 --> 03:05:20.880 align:start position:0%
down to zero
 
03:05:22.870 --> 03:05:22.880 align:start position:0%
patients being housed in the emergency
 
03:05:24.309 --> 03:05:24.319 align:start position:0%
room that has
 
03:05:26.710 --> 03:05:26.720 align:start position:0%
gone way back up again it's very
 
03:05:28.309 --> 03:05:28.319 align:start position:0%
stressful for hospitals
 
03:05:30.150 --> 03:05:30.160 align:start position:0%
because we because you have to take care
 
03:05:31.670 --> 03:05:31.680 align:start position:0%
of the emergency room it's stressful for
 
03:05:33.349 --> 03:05:33.359 align:start position:0%
physicians and nurses
 
03:05:35.670 --> 03:05:35.680 align:start position:0%
it's stressful for other patients there
 
03:05:36.469 --> 03:05:36.479 align:start position:0%
as well so
 
03:05:38.070 --> 03:05:38.080 align:start position:0%
i'm saying that a lot of the services
 
03:05:39.830 --> 03:05:39.840 align:start position:0%
are things like mental health
 
03:05:42.309 --> 03:05:42.319 align:start position:0%
which we are not funding adequately
 
03:05:42.319 --> 03:05:43.110 align:start position:0%
which we are not funding adequately
medicaid

03:05:43.110 --> 03:05:43.120 align:start position:0%
medicaid
 
03:05:45.670 --> 03:05:45.680 align:start position:0%
we have which is uh as you know a
 
03:05:45.680 --> 03:05:46.309 align:start position:0%
we have which is uh as you know a
combined

03:05:46.309 --> 03:05:46.319 align:start position:0%
combined
 
03:05:50.309 --> 03:05:50.319 align:start position:0%
federal and state program we provide
 
03:05:54.150 --> 03:05:54.160 align:start position:0%
43 less revenues for medicaid than does
 
03:05:57.429 --> 03:05:57.439 align:start position:0%
our neighboring state in vermont um
 
03:05:59.269 --> 03:05:59.279 align:start position:0%
and so what i'm really arguing for is
 
03:06:01.269 --> 03:06:01.279 align:start position:0%
that not for
 
03:06:04.230 --> 03:06:04.240 align:start position:0%
simply just cut taxes or simply
 
03:06:04.240 --> 03:06:05.349 align:start position:0%
simply just cut taxes or simply
overspend

03:06:05.349 --> 03:06:05.359 align:start position:0%
overspend
 
03:06:08.230 --> 03:06:08.240 align:start position:0%
the taxpayer money i would like to think
 
03:06:09.190 --> 03:06:09.200 align:start position:0%
of ourselves
 
03:06:12.389 --> 03:06:12.399 align:start position:0%
as fiscally responsible but socially
 
03:06:12.399 --> 03:06:13.349 align:start position:0%
as fiscally responsible but socially
aware

03:06:13.349 --> 03:06:13.359 align:start position:0%
aware
 
03:06:15.990 --> 03:06:16.000 align:start position:0%
of the problems in the state and we have
 
03:06:17.910 --> 03:06:17.920 align:start position:0%
significant social issues and i'm just
 
03:06:19.590 --> 03:06:19.600 align:start position:0%
saying that
 
03:06:22.469 --> 03:06:22.479 align:start position:0%
we can only gut our revenue sources so
 
03:06:23.750 --> 03:06:23.760 align:start position:0%
much before people
 
03:06:26.630 --> 03:06:26.640 align:start position:0%
suffer and you see it day and night food
 
03:06:28.790 --> 03:06:28.800 align:start position:0%
insecurity in this state right now is
 
03:06:30.469 --> 03:06:30.479 align:start position:0%
going through the roof
 
03:06:32.870 --> 03:06:32.880 align:start position:0%
our unemployment rate is is twice what
 
03:06:34.710 --> 03:06:34.720 align:start position:0%
it was before the pandemic so
 
03:06:37.110 --> 03:06:37.120 align:start position:0%
i'm just trying to shed an overarching
 
03:06:38.469 --> 03:06:38.479 align:start position:0%
view of
 
03:06:40.150 --> 03:06:40.160 align:start position:0%
maybe a middle ground that we need to
 
03:06:41.670 --> 03:06:41.680 align:start position:0%
take with respect to
 
03:06:44.469 --> 03:06:44.479 align:start position:0%
taxes versus you know spending so thank
 
03:06:44.479 --> 03:06:46.230 align:start position:0%
taxes versus you know spending so thank
you

03:06:46.230 --> 03:06:46.240 align:start position:0%
you
 
03:06:47.910 --> 03:06:47.920 align:start position:0%
thank you representative murphy
 
03:06:47.920 --> 03:06:49.349 align:start position:0%
thank you representative murphy

and thank you uh representative murphy
 
03:06:58.710 --> 03:06:58.720 align:start position:0%
for that comment uh this
 
03:07:02.150 --> 03:07:02.160 align:start position:0%
uh uh i was in an unrelated meeting
 
03:07:05.269 --> 03:07:05.279 align:start position:0%
to in another meeting last night where i
 
03:07:05.279 --> 03:07:06.070 align:start position:0%
to in another meeting last night where i
learned

03:07:06.070 --> 03:07:06.080 align:start position:0%
learned
 
03:07:09.190 --> 03:07:09.200 align:start position:0%
just about this mental health situation
 
03:07:11.830 --> 03:07:11.840 align:start position:0%
that you're talking about um and the
 
03:07:13.670 --> 03:07:13.680 align:start position:0%
emergency room situation i also found
 
03:07:13.680 --> 03:07:14.389 align:start position:0%
emergency room situation i also found
out

03:07:14.389 --> 03:07:14.399 align:start position:0%
out
 
03:07:16.230 --> 03:07:16.240 align:start position:0%
in that meeting that we're sending kids
 
03:07:18.070 --> 03:07:18.080 align:start position:0%
down to anna jack's hospital
 
03:07:19.830 --> 03:07:19.840 align:start position:0%
because we can't do it here where
 
03:07:21.910 --> 03:07:21.920 align:start position:0%
there's it's over it's overflowing
 
03:07:23.429 --> 03:07:23.439 align:start position:0%
and they're they're hanging out in
 
03:07:25.030 --> 03:07:25.040 align:start position:0%
emergency rooms with these
 
03:07:28.950 --> 03:07:28.960 align:start position:0%
these same kinds of things so um
 
03:07:32.230 --> 03:07:32.240 align:start position:0%
what i'm what i what i want to use here
 
03:07:34.870 --> 03:07:34.880 align:start position:0%
is a response to representative
 
03:07:34.880 --> 03:07:35.750 align:start position:0%
is a response to representative
bernstein

03:07:35.750 --> 03:07:35.760 align:start position:0%
bernstein
 
03:07:40.630 --> 03:07:40.640 align:start position:0%
to say that there's a cost here
 
03:07:44.710 --> 03:07:44.720 align:start position:0%
a societal cost an infrastructure cost
 
03:07:46.950 --> 03:07:46.960 align:start position:0%
and i think this is still and i can i
 
03:07:48.950 --> 03:07:48.960 align:start position:0%
think this all goes to
 
03:07:51.510 --> 03:07:51.520 align:start position:0%
what kind of a state we are and do
 
03:07:53.110 --> 03:07:53.120 align:start position:0%
people look at us
 
03:07:55.269 --> 03:07:55.279 align:start position:0%
as a place to do business as a place to
 
03:07:57.190 --> 03:07:57.200 align:start position:0%
come to as a place to raise their family
 
03:07:58.070 --> 03:07:58.080 align:start position:0%
as a place
 
03:08:00.309 --> 03:08:00.319 align:start position:0%
that we're going to take care of our own
 
03:08:02.150 --> 03:08:02.160 align:start position:0%
and um
 
03:08:04.550 --> 03:08:04.560 align:start position:0%
and earlier another testimony i talked
 
03:08:06.550 --> 03:08:06.560 align:start position:0%
about how this trickles down to
 
03:08:08.469 --> 03:08:08.479 align:start position:0%
towns and property taxpayers and it does
 
03:08:09.990 --> 03:08:10.000 align:start position:0%
and i wasn't talking about building a
 
03:08:11.830 --> 03:08:11.840 align:start position:0%
new school
 
03:08:14.870 --> 03:08:14.880 align:start position:0%
uh with raising uh that money this is
 
03:08:14.880 --> 03:08:15.830 align:start position:0%
uh with raising uh that money this is
about

03:08:15.830 --> 03:08:15.840 align:start position:0%
about
 
03:08:17.830 --> 03:08:17.840 align:start position:0%
being able to keep and hire good
 
03:08:17.840 --> 03:08:18.870 align:start position:0%
being able to keep and hire good
policemen

03:08:18.870 --> 03:08:18.880 align:start position:0%
policemen
 
03:08:21.110 --> 03:08:21.120 align:start position:0%
keeping higher good firefighters keeping
 
03:08:23.110 --> 03:08:23.120 align:start position:0%
higher good teachers
 
03:08:24.870 --> 03:08:24.880 align:start position:0%
based upon the backs of the property
 
03:08:24.880 --> 03:08:26.230 align:start position:0%
based upon the backs of the property
taxpayers

03:08:26.230 --> 03:08:26.240 align:start position:0%
taxpayers
 
03:08:30.309 --> 03:08:30.319 align:start position:0%
so uh that's where that's my position
 
03:08:33.590 --> 03:08:33.600 align:start position:0%
and i believe that all of this goes to
 
03:08:36.630 --> 03:08:36.640 align:start position:0%
who we are and what we define as a as a
 
03:08:36.640 --> 03:08:37.349 align:start position:0%
who we are and what we define as a as a
quality

03:08:37.349 --> 03:08:37.359 align:start position:0%
quality
 
03:08:40.790 --> 03:08:40.800 align:start position:0%
place to live and encourage people to
 
03:08:42.710 --> 03:08:42.720 align:start position:0%
grow their families here
 
03:08:46.150 --> 03:08:46.160 align:start position:0%
end of conversation thank you thank you
 
03:08:46.160 --> 03:08:46.830 align:start position:0%
end of conversation thank you thank you
mr

03:08:46.830 --> 03:08:46.840 align:start position:0%
mr
 
03:08:46.840 --> 03:08:51.269 align:start position:0%
mr
representative

03:08:51.269 --> 03:08:51.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:57.750 --> 03:08:57.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:01.670 --> 03:09:01.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:04.309 --> 03:09:04.319 align:start position:0%
we're going to have to break the apple
 
03:09:06.150 --> 03:09:06.160 align:start position:0%
and make a decision on
 
03:09:10.790 --> 03:09:10.800 align:start position:0%
210 568.
 
03:09:14.309 --> 03:09:14.319 align:start position:0%
once you seriously consider we need to
 
03:09:17.030 --> 03:09:17.040 align:start position:0%
get it out by march 11th
 
03:09:19.030 --> 03:09:19.040 align:start position:0%
looks like we may not get it out this
 
03:09:19.040 --> 03:09:20.469 align:start position:0%
looks like we may not get it out this
week

03:09:20.469 --> 03:09:20.479 align:start position:0%
week
 
03:09:23.670 --> 03:09:23.680 align:start position:0%
uh but we'll see how things progress
 
03:09:26.950 --> 03:09:26.960 align:start position:0%
now tomorrow we have public hearings on
 
03:09:29.429 --> 03:09:29.439 align:start position:0%
so many bills what i was planning on is
 
03:09:29.439 --> 03:09:30.790 align:start position:0%
so many bills what i was planning on is
that

03:09:30.790 --> 03:09:30.800 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:09:33.030 --> 03:09:33.040 align:start position:0%
some of those bills aren't very long
 
03:09:35.190 --> 03:09:35.200 align:start position:0%
especially the ones in the morning
 
03:09:38.229 --> 03:09:38.239 align:start position:0%
that we could take some time in between
 
03:09:39.910 --> 03:09:39.920 align:start position:0%
the bills
 
03:09:43.590 --> 03:09:43.600 align:start position:0%
to at least exact
 
03:09:45.990 --> 03:09:46.000 align:start position:0%
a coup a few of these bills that we
 
03:09:48.229 --> 03:09:48.239 align:start position:0%
talked about today
 
03:09:51.510 --> 03:09:51.520 align:start position:0%
if the amendment on 3 30
 
03:09:56.830 --> 03:09:56.840 align:start position:0%
and 306 is ready that would be a big
 
03:09:56.840 --> 03:09:58.309 align:start position:0%
and 306 is ready that would be a big
help

03:09:58.309 --> 03:09:58.319 align:start position:0%
help
 
03:10:03.110 --> 03:10:03.120 align:start position:0%
for those that we don't exec
 
03:10:05.750 --> 03:10:05.760 align:start position:0%
tomorrow will have another bite of the
 
03:10:05.760 --> 03:10:06.790 align:start position:0%
tomorrow will have another bite of the
apple

03:10:06.790 --> 03:10:06.800 align:start position:0%
apple
 
03:10:08.950 --> 03:10:08.960 align:start position:0%
when we have public hearings again which
 
03:10:12.550 --> 03:10:12.560 align:start position:0%
would be
 
03:10:22.950 --> 03:10:22.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:28.550 --> 03:10:28.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:31.110 --> 03:10:31.120 align:start position:0%
on the 18th we're going to have to meet
 
03:10:31.120 --> 03:10:31.670 align:start position:0%
on the 18th we're going to have to meet
with

03:10:31.670 --> 03:10:31.680 align:start position:0%
with
 
03:10:34.790 --> 03:10:34.800 align:start position:0%
the governor's budget director and go
 
03:10:37.750 --> 03:10:37.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:41.750 --> 03:10:41.760 align:start position:0%
revenues on the 23rd like to get the
 
03:10:41.760 --> 03:10:43.110 align:start position:0%
revenues on the 23rd like to get the
draft

03:10:43.110 --> 03:10:43.120 align:start position:0%
draft
 
03:10:48.150 --> 03:10:48.160 align:start position:0%
numbers out of the revenue so we can
 
03:10:51.990 --> 03:10:52.000 align:start position:0%
send these numbers over to finance
 
03:10:55.190 --> 03:10:55.200 align:start position:0%
with or without an hr and that's what
 
03:10:59.990 --> 03:11:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:03.670 --> 03:11:03.680 align:start position:0%
that's essentially and then that's the
 
03:11:08.070 --> 03:11:08.080 align:start position:0%
23rd there isn't much time left between
 
03:11:12.150 --> 03:11:12.160 align:start position:0%
the 11th but we have
 
03:11:14.229 --> 03:11:14.239 align:start position:0%
all of these bills that we talked about
 
03:11:14.239 --> 03:11:15.910 align:start position:0%
all of these bills that we talked about
today

03:11:15.910 --> 03:11:15.920 align:start position:0%
today
 
03:11:20.830 --> 03:11:20.840 align:start position:0%
we have i think seven new bills just
 
03:11:20.840 --> 03:11:25.269 align:start position:0%
we have i think seven new bills just
here

03:11:25.269 --> 03:11:25.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:30.150 --> 03:11:30.160 align:start position:0%
on the 17th
 
03:11:32.710 --> 03:11:32.720 align:start position:0%
and then we'll pop we'll be getting
 
03:11:32.720 --> 03:11:33.590 align:start position:0%
and then we'll pop we'll be getting
bills

03:11:33.590 --> 03:11:33.600 align:start position:0%
bills
 
03:11:39.349 --> 03:11:39.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:42.150 --> 03:11:42.160 align:start position:0%
after they have the session on the 24th
 
03:11:43.910 --> 03:11:43.920 align:start position:0%
and the 25th
 
03:11:46.870 --> 03:11:46.880 align:start position:0%
those bills that the policy committees
 
03:11:46.880 --> 03:11:47.269 align:start position:0%
those bills that the policy committees
have

03:11:47.269 --> 03:11:47.279 align:start position:0%
have
 
03:11:50.469 --> 03:11:50.479 align:start position:0%
passed and they pass the
 
03:11:53.429 --> 03:11:53.439 align:start position:0%
session they deal with revenues look at
 
03:11:56.469 --> 03:11:56.479 align:start position:0%
getting those bills
 
03:11:58.150 --> 03:11:58.160 align:start position:0%
that's essentially where we stand at
 
03:12:00.469 --> 03:12:00.479 align:start position:0%
this point in time so
 
03:12:02.150 --> 03:12:02.160 align:start position:0%
i think we've done a great job this
 
03:12:04.389 --> 03:12:04.399 align:start position:0%
morning here it is just 12
 
03:12:07.030 --> 03:12:07.040 align:start position:0%
after 12. we've gone through an awful
 
03:12:07.040 --> 03:12:08.710 align:start position:0%
after 12. we've gone through an awful
lot

03:12:08.710 --> 03:12:08.720 align:start position:0%
lot
 
03:12:11.830 --> 03:12:11.840 align:start position:0%
thank everybody for participating
 
03:12:14.389 --> 03:12:14.399 align:start position:0%
we still have a few more people that we
 
03:12:16.550 --> 03:12:16.560 align:start position:0%
need to
 
03:12:19.830 --> 03:12:19.840 align:start position:0%
get them going because you know the only
 
03:12:20.710 --> 03:12:20.720 align:start position:0%
way this
 
03:12:23.750 --> 03:12:23.760 align:start position:0%
works is everybody contributes their
 
03:12:30.790 --> 03:12:30.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:33.269 --> 03:12:33.279 align:start position:0%

now

03:13:14.550 --> 03:13:14.560 align:start position:0%
now
 
03:13:18.630 --> 03:13:18.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:22.550 --> 03:13:22.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:24.150 --> 03:13:24.160 align:start position:0%
yesterday we uh when we were doing the
 
03:13:26.150 --> 03:13:26.160 align:start position:0%
revenues um
 
03:13:27.910 --> 03:13:27.920 align:start position:0%
we we were talking about the tobacco
 
03:13:30.309 --> 03:13:30.319 align:start position:0%
attacks in the mess in massachusetts
 
03:13:32.950 --> 03:13:32.960 align:start position:0%
um i did ask jennifer still on the on
 
03:13:33.910 --> 03:13:33.920 align:start position:0%
the call here
 
03:13:36.550 --> 03:13:36.560 align:start position:0%
i did ask jennifer to research what's
 
03:13:37.750 --> 03:13:37.760 align:start position:0%
going on in
 
03:13:40.229 --> 03:13:40.239 align:start position:0%
massachusetts so hopefully she'll have
 
03:13:41.510 --> 03:13:41.520 align:start position:0%
something for us by next
 
03:13:44.150 --> 03:13:44.160 align:start position:0%
next week in terms of any legislation i
 
03:13:45.429 --> 03:13:45.439 align:start position:0%
guess there's a senate bill that's
 
03:13:45.439 --> 03:13:46.389 align:start position:0%
guess there's a senate bill that's
active

03:13:46.389 --> 03:13:46.399 align:start position:0%
active
 
03:13:47.910 --> 03:13:47.920 align:start position:0%
but she's going to research as much as
 
03:13:50.309 --> 03:13:50.319 align:start position:0%
you can before next week for us
 
03:13:55.030 --> 03:13:55.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:57.990 --> 03:13:58.000 align:start position:0%
was jennifer on yeah she was but she had
 
03:13:59.349 --> 03:13:59.359 align:start position:0%
to take a break
 
03:14:01.190 --> 03:14:01.200 align:start position:0%
he's been monitoring you go to another
 
03:14:02.630 --> 03:14:02.640 align:start position:0%
room that's what i should
 
03:14:05.910 --> 03:14:05.920 align:start position:0%
he's monitoring a couple of uh we'll get
 
03:14:08.469 --> 03:14:08.479 align:start position:0%
that later then
 
03:14:10.070 --> 03:14:10.080 align:start position:0%
she's gonna she's going to report to us
 
03:14:11.670 --> 03:14:11.680 align:start position:0%
next week
 
03:14:14.950 --> 03:14:14.960 align:start position:0%
okay anything else from any of the
 
03:14:16.950 --> 03:14:16.960 align:start position:0%
committee members
 
03:14:21.110 --> 03:14:21.120 align:start position:0%
if not mr mr chairman yes representative
 
03:14:23.910 --> 03:14:23.920 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to let the new members
 
03:14:25.830 --> 03:14:25.840 align:start position:0%
know that if you
 
03:14:28.790 --> 03:14:28.800 align:start position:0%
volunteer to write a blurb the chairman
 
03:14:28.800 --> 03:14:29.670 align:start position:0%
volunteer to write a blurb the chairman
on

03:14:29.670 --> 03:14:29.680 align:start position:0%
on
 
03:14:32.710 --> 03:14:32.720 align:start position:0%
can work with you to make sure that
 
03:14:36.830 --> 03:14:36.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:36.840 --> 03:14:40.309 align:start position:0%
 
absolutely

03:14:40.309 --> 03:14:40.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:42.229 --> 03:14:42.239 align:start position:0%
and uh i already have one board but
 
03:14:45.590 --> 03:14:45.600 align:start position:0%
we've got to sit down with somebody
 
03:14:48.950 --> 03:14:48.960 align:start position:0%
and discuss it because the verb
 
03:14:53.590 --> 03:14:53.600 align:start position:0%
should clearly state what the bill does
 
03:14:55.750 --> 03:14:55.760 align:start position:0%
and if there's amendment you have to
 
03:14:57.830 --> 03:14:57.840 align:start position:0%
explain the amendment
 
03:15:01.590 --> 03:15:01.600 align:start position:0%
and then also explain
 
03:15:05.990 --> 03:15:06.000 align:start position:0%
why the committee is doing what they do
 
03:15:09.110 --> 03:15:09.120 align:start position:0%
and if it costs money how much yes
 
03:15:12.309 --> 03:15:12.319 align:start position:0%
or racism the effect
 
03:15:17.269 --> 03:15:17.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:19.190 --> 03:15:19.200 align:start position:0%
and if you have any problems you can
 
03:15:22.389 --> 03:15:22.399 align:start position:0%
always start by looking at
 
03:15:26.469 --> 03:15:26.479 align:start position:0%
last year's verbs
 
03:15:30.229 --> 03:15:30.239 align:start position:0%
and you'll find one that covers this
 
03:15:32.389 --> 03:15:32.399 align:start position:0%
subject similar to what you have and it
 
03:15:34.389 --> 03:15:34.399 align:start position:0%
gives you an idea because
 
03:15:35.990 --> 03:15:36.000 align:start position:0%
by the time the burp gets into the
 
03:15:38.389 --> 03:15:38.399 align:start position:0%
calendar it's reviewed by
 
03:15:41.830 --> 03:15:41.840 align:start position:0%
the chairman
 
03:15:44.070 --> 03:15:44.080 align:start position:0%
and then the clerks and then it goes to
 
03:15:46.469 --> 03:15:46.479 align:start position:0%
the house court and house court
 
03:15:48.630 --> 03:15:48.640 align:start position:0%
may make changes and you won't know that
 
03:15:49.670 --> 03:15:49.680 align:start position:0%
until it comes out
 
03:15:53.030 --> 03:15:53.040 align:start position:0%
in print and then
 
03:15:57.030 --> 03:15:57.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:00.550 --> 03:16:00.560 align:start position:0%
and we want that to reflect
 
03:16:02.950 --> 03:16:02.960 align:start position:0%
our committee doing their job there's
 
03:16:04.389 --> 03:16:04.399 align:start position:0%
nothing worse than
 
03:16:07.510 --> 03:16:07.520 align:start position:0%
reading somebody's board and uh
 
03:16:11.110 --> 03:16:11.120 align:start position:0%
we passed this committee want to pass a
 
03:16:15.830 --> 03:16:15.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:20.630 --> 03:16:20.640 align:start position:0%
all right have a good lunch
 
03:16:57.510 --> 03:16:57.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:00.550 --> 03:17:00.560 align:start position:0%
hey edie hi
 
03:17:03.429 --> 03:17:03.439 align:start position:0%
wonderful john jen to tell her we're all
 
03:17:03.439 --> 03:17:04.950 align:start position:0%
wonderful john jen to tell her we're all
done

03:17:04.950 --> 03:17:04.960 align:start position:0%
done
 
03:17:08.229 --> 03:17:08.239 align:start position:0%
well so we're coming back after lunch
 
03:17:11.510 --> 03:17:11.520 align:start position:0%
no i didn't think so
 
03:17:16.469 --> 03:17:16.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:18.550 --> 03:17:18.560 align:start position:0%
it's sunny out so maybe it's warmer i
 
03:17:19.830 --> 03:17:19.840 align:start position:0%
can go for a walk
 
03:17:23.110 --> 03:17:23.120 align:start position:0%
yeah it looks beautiful it made me
 
03:17:23.120 --> 03:17:23.670 align:start position:0%
yeah it looks beautiful it made me
nervous

03:17:23.670 --> 03:17:23.680 align:start position:0%
nervous
 
03:17:25.750 --> 03:17:25.760 align:start position:0%
when uh representative romney said
 
03:17:28.950 --> 03:17:28.960 align:start position:0%
they'd discuss this in caucus
 
03:17:33.349 --> 03:17:33.359 align:start position:0%
um yeah because that's a really
 
03:17:35.670 --> 03:17:35.680 align:start position:0%
you know there are lots of people in the
 
03:17:37.830 --> 03:17:37.840 align:start position:0%
north country who are in my position
 
03:17:38.630 --> 03:17:38.640 align:start position:0%
although i'm
 
03:17:41.349 --> 03:17:41.359 align:start position:0%
relatively fortunate economically but
 
03:17:42.389 --> 03:17:42.399 align:start position:0%
that is that
 
03:17:45.429 --> 03:17:45.439 align:start position:0%
they're widows and they're paying
 
03:17:48.469 --> 03:17:48.479 align:start position:0%
interest and dividends tax on they have
 
03:17:50.389 --> 03:17:50.399 align:start position:0%
social security
 
03:17:53.510 --> 03:17:53.520 align:start position:0%
which is less when they're just one
 
03:17:57.830 --> 03:17:57.840 align:start position:0%
survivor and you know
 
03:18:00.469 --> 03:18:00.479 align:start position:0%
that group that particular tier is
 
03:18:02.229 --> 03:18:02.239 align:start position:0%
really hard hit by that
 
03:18:05.030 --> 03:18:05.040 align:start position:0%
and i understand that the state counts
 
03:18:06.870 --> 03:18:06.880 align:start position:0%
on that revenue
 
03:18:10.950 --> 03:18:10.960 align:start position:0%
but you know and it's going to be worse
 
03:18:11.590 --> 03:18:11.600 align:start position:0%
and worse
 
03:18:13.990 --> 03:18:14.000 align:start position:0%
as more and more people don't have
 
03:18:14.000 --> 03:18:15.110 align:start position:0%
as more and more people don't have
pensions

03:18:15.110 --> 03:18:15.120 align:start position:0%
pensions
 
03:18:17.030 --> 03:18:17.040 align:start position:0%
or they're getting distributions for a
 
03:18:17.040 --> 03:18:18.790 align:start position:0%
or they're getting distributions for a
401k

03:18:18.790 --> 03:18:18.800 align:start position:0%
401k
 
03:18:20.830 --> 03:18:20.840 align:start position:0%
and i assume when they talk about
 
03:18:22.630 --> 03:18:22.640 align:start position:0%
distributions we've never really
 
03:18:24.070 --> 03:18:24.080 align:start position:0%
established that
 
03:18:27.510 --> 03:18:27.520 align:start position:0%
but is that what they're talking about
 
03:18:29.750 --> 03:18:29.760 align:start position:0%
i don't know i found that confusing but
 
03:18:31.429 --> 03:18:31.439 align:start position:0%
i was looking through some of our tax
 
03:18:32.469 --> 03:18:32.479 align:start position:0%
documents and
 
03:18:36.229 --> 03:18:36.239 align:start position:0%
i saw that word in there distributions
 
03:18:36.239 --> 03:18:37.590 align:start position:0%
i saw that word in there distributions
and

03:18:37.590 --> 03:18:37.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:18:41.590 --> 03:18:41.600 align:start position:0%
try and figure out you know what it is
 
03:18:45.269 --> 03:18:45.279 align:start position:0%
specifically well this year the
 
03:18:47.670 --> 03:18:47.680 align:start position:0%
the feds said you didn't need to take a
 
03:18:50.309 --> 03:18:50.319 align:start position:0%
minimum required distribution
 
03:18:53.830 --> 03:18:53.840 align:start position:0%
if you had ira or a 401k
 
03:18:57.349 --> 03:18:57.359 align:start position:0%
but most people did because in fact
 
03:18:59.910 --> 03:18:59.920 align:start position:0%
that's that's the income they're living
 
03:19:02.830 --> 03:19:02.840 align:start position:0%
on plus social security i mean they're
 
03:19:02.840 --> 03:19:04.229 align:start position:0%
on plus social security i mean they're
not

03:19:04.229 --> 03:19:04.239 align:start position:0%
not
 
03:19:07.110 --> 03:19:07.120 align:start position:0%
yeah only wealthy people should come
 
03:19:07.120 --> 03:19:07.510 align:start position:0%
yeah only wealthy people should come
over

03:19:07.510 --> 03:19:07.520 align:start position:0%
over
 
03:19:09.349 --> 03:19:09.359 align:start position:0%
and that shouldn't come under interest
 
03:19:11.510 --> 03:19:11.520 align:start position:0%
and dividends should it
 
03:19:14.150 --> 03:19:14.160 align:start position:0%
i i think we ought to ask whether that's
 
03:19:16.830 --> 03:19:16.840 align:start position:0%
a distribution or not
 
03:19:20.790 --> 03:19:20.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:23.269 --> 03:19:23.279 align:start position:0%
i don't know yeah but i mean if we're
 
03:19:25.110 --> 03:19:25.120 align:start position:0%
going to fiddle around with it
 
03:19:28.870 --> 03:19:28.880 align:start position:0%
we need to understand it better right
 
03:19:32.389 --> 03:19:32.399 align:start position:0%
because i think that with
 
03:19:36.630 --> 03:19:36.640 align:start position:0%
the world of pensions disappearing
 
03:19:38.870 --> 03:19:38.880 align:start position:0%
and certainly up here you know most of
 
03:19:40.309 --> 03:19:40.319 align:start position:0%
the people who worked at the mail who
 
03:19:40.319 --> 03:19:41.670 align:start position:0%
the people who worked at the mail who
expected

03:19:41.670 --> 03:19:41.680 align:start position:0%
expected
 
03:19:45.349 --> 03:19:45.359 align:start position:0%
get a pension right they never got it
 
03:19:49.269 --> 03:19:49.279 align:start position:0%
because the guy on the paper mill
 
03:19:52.950 --> 03:19:52.960 align:start position:0%
was a crook and
 
03:19:55.510 --> 03:19:55.520 align:start position:0%
you know he's still in jail i think in
 
03:19:57.590 --> 03:19:57.600 align:start position:0%
any case they never got their pensions
 
03:20:00.630 --> 03:20:00.640 align:start position:0%
so people who built a life of
 
03:20:03.030 --> 03:20:03.040 align:start position:0%
really hard work and a lot of those jobs
 
03:20:03.040 --> 03:20:04.309 align:start position:0%
really hard work and a lot of those jobs
were

03:20:04.309 --> 03:20:04.319 align:start position:0%
were
 
03:20:07.670 --> 03:20:07.680 align:start position:0%
i would consider really hard work
 
03:20:11.110 --> 03:20:11.120 align:start position:0%
working at the pulp mill but we probably
 
03:20:12.070 --> 03:20:12.080 align:start position:0%
should tell
 
03:20:16.389 --> 03:20:16.399 align:start position:0%
tom lochmann we're all done for the day
 
03:20:18.389 --> 03:20:18.399 align:start position:0%
okay good to know thank you i got
 
03:20:20.309 --> 03:20:20.319 align:start position:0%
disconnected i had a connectivity issue
 
03:20:21.510 --> 03:20:21.520 align:start position:0%
where it was
 
03:20:22.950 --> 03:20:22.960 align:start position:0%
i was trying to promote you from
