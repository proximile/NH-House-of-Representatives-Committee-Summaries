Department of Health and Human Services
 
00:06:50.749 --> 00:06:50.759 align:start position:0%
so I'm here today to walk you through
 
00:06:52.909 --> 00:06:52.919 align:start position:0%
what requests the department would like
 
00:06:55.189 --> 00:06:55.199 align:start position:0%
to make and which is brought forth in
 
00:06:58.010 --> 00:06:58.020 align:start position:0%
Senate bill 94.
 
00:07:01.010 --> 00:07:01.020 align:start position:0%
um the this proposed legislation wants
 
00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:02.520 align:start position:0%
to amend certain definitions to address
 
00:07:04.249 --> 00:07:04.259 align:start position:0%
some inconsistencies between the
 
00:07:06.370 --> 00:07:06.380 align:start position:0%
definition and to update others
 
00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:09.000 align:start position:0%
for the part one the child daycare
 
00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:11.940 align:start position:0%
licensing definitions the change that is
 
00:07:14.749 --> 00:07:14.759 align:start position:0%
being requested on page one in lines two
 
00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:16.560 align:start position:0%
through four and
 
00:07:19.550 --> 00:07:19.560 align:start position:0%
I I didn't see the copy that was
 
00:07:21.230 --> 00:07:21.240 align:start position:0%
presented here so I'm hoping that what I
 
00:07:22.850 --> 00:07:22.860 align:start position:0%
printed off the internet is what you
 
00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:24.720 align:start position:0%
what you have as well
 
00:07:27.230 --> 00:07:27.240 align:start position:0%
um but it's part one page one lines two
 
00:07:28.189 --> 00:07:28.199 align:start position:0%
through four
 
00:07:29.689 --> 00:07:29.699 align:start position:0%
um we're requesting to change the
 
00:07:31.490 --> 00:07:31.500 align:start position:0%
definition of
 
00:07:33.110 --> 00:07:33.120 align:start position:0%
um child daycare caring for children
 
00:07:35.270 --> 00:07:35.280 align:start position:0%
younger than three years of age instead
 
00:07:36.710 --> 00:07:36.720 align:start position:0%
of calling it a childcare Nursery we
 
00:07:38.210 --> 00:07:38.220 align:start position:0%
just wish to updates terminology to
 
00:07:41.029 --> 00:07:41.039 align:start position:0%
infant and toddler program
 
00:07:43.129 --> 00:07:43.139 align:start position:0%
um part two and three under day care
 
00:07:45.290 --> 00:07:45.300 align:start position:0%
licensing license renewal
 
00:07:47.150 --> 00:07:47.160 align:start position:0%
um this change adds the following to the
 
00:07:49.010 --> 00:07:49.020 align:start position:0%
renewal process for a child daycare
 
00:07:52.189 --> 00:07:52.199 align:start position:0%
licenses corrective action plans as part
 
00:07:54.170 --> 00:07:54.180 align:start position:0%
of the additional information required
 
00:07:56.330 --> 00:07:56.340 align:start position:0%
for a renewal application if the
 
00:07:57.890 --> 00:07:57.900 align:start position:0%
department has conducted an inspection
 
00:08:00.050 --> 00:08:00.060 align:start position:0%
and determined that the child daycare
 
00:08:01.550 --> 00:08:01.560 align:start position:0%
agency is out of compliance with
 
00:08:03.650 --> 00:08:03.660 align:start position:0%
licensing rules
 
00:08:05.210 --> 00:08:05.220 align:start position:0%
um at the requirement that corrective
 
00:08:07.309 --> 00:08:07.319 align:start position:0%
action plans are received prior to the
 
00:08:10.370 --> 00:08:10.380 align:start position:0%
renewal of a child daycare license and a
 
00:08:11.930 --> 00:08:11.940 align:start position:0%
new paragraph that allows the department
 
00:08:14.029 --> 00:08:14.039 align:start position:0%
to renew a license without inspecting
 
00:08:16.309 --> 00:08:16.319 align:start position:0%
the premises if the program is not
 
00:08:18.529 --> 00:08:18.539 align:start position:0%
operating provided local fire and health
 
00:08:19.969 --> 00:08:19.979 align:start position:0%
approvals have been completed as
 
00:08:21.710 --> 00:08:21.720 align:start position:0%
required that's already part of the
 
00:08:23.869 --> 00:08:23.879 align:start position:0%
application process this will ensure
 
00:08:25.550 --> 00:08:25.560 align:start position:0%
that there is no delay in renewing
 
00:08:27.350 --> 00:08:27.360 align:start position:0%
licenses for programs that do not
 
00:08:29.689 --> 00:08:29.699 align:start position:0%
operate year round or are closed for
 
00:08:31.610 --> 00:08:31.620 align:start position:0%
other unplanned reasons the department
 
00:08:33.170 --> 00:08:33.180 align:start position:0%
will be required to complete an
 
00:08:34.790 --> 00:08:34.800 align:start position:0%
inspection within 30 days of when the
 
00:08:36.709 --> 00:08:36.719 align:start position:0%
program opens
 
00:08:39.469 --> 00:08:39.479 align:start position:0%
and do you prefer that I read through
 
00:08:40.850 --> 00:08:40.860 align:start position:0%
the whole thing or do you want to stop
 
00:08:43.130 --> 00:08:43.140 align:start position:0%
section by section uh let's go Section
 
00:08:44.209 --> 00:08:44.219 align:start position:0%
by section I think we've got my
 
00:08:46.850 --> 00:08:46.860 align:start position:0%
preference then so all of it at once at
 
00:08:48.410 --> 00:08:48.420 align:start position:0%
least my brain wouldn't be able to
 
00:08:50.690 --> 00:08:50.700 align:start position:0%
handle all that so that's what yeah
 
00:08:52.490 --> 00:08:52.500 align:start position:0%
um so are there any questions
 
00:08:55.910 --> 00:08:55.920 align:start position:0%
for part two or three for the renewals
 
00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:56.990 align:start position:0%
for part two or three for the renewals
yes

00:08:56.990 --> 00:08:57.000 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:08:58.970 --> 00:08:58.980 align:start position:0%
represent McWilliams
 
00:09:00.710 --> 00:09:00.720 align:start position:0%
thank you chair um and thank you very
 
00:09:02.810 --> 00:09:02.820 align:start position:0%
much for bringing this bill
 
00:09:05.269 --> 00:09:05.279 align:start position:0%
um just a question about the timeline
 
00:09:07.550 --> 00:09:07.560 align:start position:0%
for the corrective action plan and then
 
00:09:09.410 --> 00:09:09.420 align:start position:0%
of course receipt and acknowledgment and
 
00:09:10.970 --> 00:09:10.980 align:start position:0%
approval of the corrective action plan
 
00:09:13.310 --> 00:09:13.320 align:start position:0%
do we have some rules through gel car as
 
00:09:14.750 --> 00:09:14.760 align:start position:0%
to how much time that can actually take
 
00:09:16.910 --> 00:09:16.920 align:start position:0%
right now um there's actually
 
00:09:19.250 --> 00:09:19.260 align:start position:0%
um statutes around that as well as and
 
00:09:20.810 --> 00:09:20.820 align:start position:0%
obviously we incorporate those statutes
 
00:09:23.810 --> 00:09:23.820 align:start position:0%
in our rules so there is um we need to
 
00:09:26.090 --> 00:09:26.100 align:start position:0%
when once we set the correct the
 
00:09:27.530 --> 00:09:27.540 align:start position:0%
statement of findings to the program
 
00:09:31.490 --> 00:09:31.500 align:start position:0%
they have 21 days to return a corrective
 
00:09:32.930 --> 00:09:32.940 align:start position:0%
action plan
 
00:09:34.730 --> 00:09:34.740 align:start position:0%
um and then we approve it and get it
 
00:09:36.829 --> 00:09:36.839 align:start position:0%
online okay yeah thank you you're
 
00:09:36.839 --> 00:09:37.910 align:start position:0%
online okay yeah thank you you're
welcome

00:09:37.910 --> 00:09:37.920 align:start position:0%
welcome
 
00:09:39.290 --> 00:09:39.300 align:start position:0%
the corrective action plan but there's
 
00:09:41.210 --> 00:09:41.220 align:start position:0%
one that's seven days right or five days
 
00:09:43.070 --> 00:09:43.080 align:start position:0%
if it's uh was it like a mandatory
 
00:09:44.990 --> 00:09:45.000 align:start position:0%
violation or something so
 
00:09:46.550 --> 00:09:46.560 align:start position:0%
uh a it's
 
00:09:48.590 --> 00:09:48.600 align:start position:0%
twin General if there's a directed
 
00:09:50.269 --> 00:09:50.279 align:start position:0%
corrective action plan where the
 
00:09:51.829 --> 00:09:51.839 align:start position:0%
department and that's defined in our
 
00:09:53.750 --> 00:09:53.760 align:start position:0%
rules where we determine that there's a
 
00:09:55.790 --> 00:09:55.800 align:start position:0%
imminent health and safety risk we can
 
00:09:57.290 --> 00:09:57.300 align:start position:0%
request a direct a corrective action
 
00:09:58.970 --> 00:09:58.980 align:start position:0%
plan and we ask those be returned within
 
00:10:01.250 --> 00:10:01.260 align:start position:0%
seven days
 
00:10:03.710 --> 00:10:03.720 align:start position:0%
that's also defined in rules
 
00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:06.650 align:start position:0%
that's also defined in rules
okay

00:10:06.650 --> 00:10:06.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:10.190 --> 00:10:10.200 align:start position:0%
is it should I proceed to part four okay
 
00:10:12.710 --> 00:10:12.720 align:start position:0%
um part four residential care and child
 
00:10:15.530 --> 00:10:15.540 align:start position:0%
placing agency licensing definitions so
 
00:10:18.110 --> 00:10:18.120 align:start position:0%
this starts on page one line 27 and it
 
00:10:21.290 --> 00:10:21.300 align:start position:0%
goes through Page four to line 31.
 
00:10:22.970 --> 00:10:22.980 align:start position:0%
um I'm not going to go through line by
 
00:10:24.650 --> 00:10:24.660 align:start position:0%
line I'll give an overview what that is
 
00:10:27.170 --> 00:10:27.180 align:start position:0%
and then I'm happy to answer questions
 
00:10:28.670 --> 00:10:28.680 align:start position:0%
um a change to the definition of child
 
00:10:31.990 --> 00:10:32.000 align:start position:0%
is being requested under RSA 170e 25
 
00:10:35.389 --> 00:10:35.399 align:start position:0%
Roman numeral one to read child means
 
00:10:38.750 --> 00:10:38.760 align:start position:0%
any person under 21 years of age and the
 
00:10:41.870 --> 00:10:41.880 align:start position:0%
changes or up to 22 years of age if the
 
00:10:43.970 --> 00:10:43.980 align:start position:0%
person is receiving special education or
 
00:10:45.670 --> 00:10:45.680 align:start position:0%
special education and related Services
 
00:10:48.110 --> 00:10:48.120 align:start position:0%
as identified by the child School
 
00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:49.190 align:start position:0%
as identified by the child School
District

00:10:49.190 --> 00:10:49.200 align:start position:0%
District
 
00:10:51.290 --> 00:10:51.300 align:start position:0%
this change is being requested to align
 
00:10:51.300 --> 00:10:52.329 align:start position:0%
this change is being requested to align
with

00:10:52.329 --> 00:10:52.339 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:10:55.490 --> 00:10:55.500 align:start position:0%
hb1513 which changed the definition of a
 
00:10:57.410 --> 00:10:57.420 align:start position:0%
child with a disability to include
 
00:10:59.509 --> 00:10:59.519 align:start position:0%
children between the ages of 3 and 21
 
00:10:59.519 --> 00:11:01.009 align:start position:0%
children between the ages of 3 and 21
inclusive

00:11:01.009 --> 00:11:01.019 align:start position:0%
inclusive
 
00:11:03.170 --> 00:11:03.180 align:start position:0%
and permit special education students to
 
00:11:05.090 --> 00:11:05.100 align:start position:0%
attend school up to their 22nd birthday
 
00:11:07.610 --> 00:11:07.620 align:start position:0%
the department licenses residential
 
00:11:09.530 --> 00:11:09.540 align:start position:0%
child care agencies for youth under 21
 
00:11:11.150 --> 00:11:11.160 align:start position:0%
years of age
 
00:11:13.069 --> 00:11:13.079 align:start position:0%
currently residential programs serve
 
00:11:14.509 --> 00:11:14.519 align:start position:0%
youth placed in their programs through
 
00:11:16.430 --> 00:11:16.440 align:start position:0%
school districts so this change would
 
00:11:18.110 --> 00:11:18.120 align:start position:0%
permit the department to license the
 
00:11:19.730 --> 00:11:19.740 align:start position:0%
residential programs for these students
 
00:11:23.389 --> 00:11:23.399 align:start position:0%
up to 21 years of age it's being done
 
00:11:26.150 --> 00:11:26.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:28.370 --> 00:11:28.380 align:start position:0%
um other changes are reorganization of
 
00:11:31.250 --> 00:11:31.260 align:start position:0%
the definitions of Child Care Agency as
 
00:11:33.110 --> 00:11:33.120 align:start position:0%
types of child care agencies were added
 
00:11:35.269 --> 00:11:35.279 align:start position:0%
to the statute over time rather than
 
00:11:38.750 --> 00:11:38.760 align:start position:0%
including them under RSA 170e
 
00:11:41.690 --> 00:11:41.700 align:start position:0%
25 Roman numeral two they became their
 
00:11:43.310 --> 00:11:43.320 align:start position:0%
own definition
 
00:11:45.230 --> 00:11:45.240 align:start position:0%
these changes move all child care
 
00:11:47.150 --> 00:11:47.160 align:start position:0%
agencies under the Child Care Agency
 
00:11:49.130 --> 00:11:49.140 align:start position:0%
definition and do not change the
 
00:11:50.870 --> 00:11:50.880 align:start position:0%
definition themselves
 
00:11:52.970 --> 00:11:52.980 align:start position:0%
this includes the definition of child
 
00:11:55.009 --> 00:11:55.019 align:start position:0%
care institution and independent living
 
00:11:57.829 --> 00:11:57.839 align:start position:0%
home as a result there are changes to
 
00:12:00.050 --> 00:12:00.060 align:start position:0%
the enumeration throughout along with
 
00:12:01.910 --> 00:12:01.920 align:start position:0%
elimination of the Redundant term Child
 
00:12:03.949 --> 00:12:03.959 align:start position:0%
Care institution and other definitions
 
00:12:05.930 --> 00:12:05.940 align:start position:0%
when the term Child Care Agency is used
 
00:12:08.150 --> 00:12:08.160 align:start position:0%
as child care institution will now be a
 
00:12:10.850 --> 00:12:10.860 align:start position:0%
type of Child Care Agency
 
00:12:12.590 --> 00:12:12.600 align:start position:0%
um and in addition the definition of
 
00:12:14.269 --> 00:12:14.279 align:start position:0%
experiential Wilderness facility has
 
00:12:15.650 --> 00:12:15.660 align:start position:0%
been removed as a type of Child Care
 
00:12:15.660 --> 00:12:18.829 align:start position:0%
been removed as a type of Child Care
Agency

00:12:18.829 --> 00:12:18.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:21.110 --> 00:12:21.120 align:start position:0%
and I'm happy to pause there to answer
 
00:12:22.670 --> 00:12:22.680 align:start position:0%
any questions on those definitions
 
00:12:22.680 --> 00:12:24.769 align:start position:0%
any questions on those definitions
representative

00:12:24.769 --> 00:12:24.779 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:12:26.509 --> 00:12:26.519 align:start position:0%
um just going back to lines one through
 
00:12:29.030 --> 00:12:29.040 align:start position:0%
three I know it's really hard to predict
 
00:12:30.290 --> 00:12:30.300 align:start position:0%
the future
 
00:12:32.150 --> 00:12:32.160 align:start position:0%
um but if there's any way that we could
 
00:12:35.930 --> 00:12:35.940 align:start position:0%
reword this instead of saying up to 22
 
00:12:37.269 --> 00:12:37.279 align:start position:0%
years of age
 
00:12:41.090 --> 00:12:41.100 align:start position:0%
simply up to the age aloud if the person
 
00:12:42.650 --> 00:12:42.660 align:start position:0%
is receiving special education or
 
00:12:44.150 --> 00:12:44.160 align:start position:0%
special education related Services
 
00:12:46.250 --> 00:12:46.260 align:start position:0%
understanding that that number may
 
00:12:47.930 --> 00:12:47.940 align:start position:0%
change in the future and it's kind of a
 
00:12:49.910 --> 00:12:49.920 align:start position:0%
pain for the legislature to have to
 
00:12:51.949 --> 00:12:51.959 align:start position:0%
revisit and redo a bill and vote on both
 
00:12:53.569 --> 00:12:53.579 align:start position:0%
houses and have the governor sign it
 
00:12:55.610 --> 00:12:55.620 align:start position:0%
perhaps it could be a little bit looser
 
00:12:57.230 --> 00:12:57.240 align:start position:0%
with the terminology would that be
 
00:12:58.370 --> 00:12:58.380 align:start position:0%
acceptable to the members of the
 
00:12:59.930 --> 00:12:59.940 align:start position:0%
committee instead of locking it in at
 
00:13:04.129 --> 00:13:04.139 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:05.870 --> 00:13:05.880 align:start position:0%
um so the only thing I would ask is if
 
00:13:08.090 --> 00:13:08.100 align:start position:0%
it points to a certain
 
00:13:10.790 --> 00:13:10.800 align:start position:0%
um other statute where wherever that age
 
00:13:12.110 --> 00:13:12.120 align:start position:0%
is being determined
 
00:13:13.910 --> 00:13:13.920 align:start position:0%
because up to the age a lot if we don't
 
00:13:16.430 --> 00:13:16.440 align:start position:0%
say a lot where so if we're pointing to
 
00:13:18.350 --> 00:13:18.360 align:start position:0%
that that would provide Clarity for us
 
00:13:20.449 --> 00:13:20.459 align:start position:0%
as well
 
00:13:22.129 --> 00:13:22.139 align:start position:0%
would your intention there uh
 
00:13:24.230 --> 00:13:24.240 align:start position:0%
representative to be to have it up to
 
00:13:26.329 --> 00:13:26.339 align:start position:0%
Loud by rule or
 
00:13:28.250 --> 00:13:28.260 align:start position:0%
just can you add a little clear I I mean
 
00:13:29.210 --> 00:13:29.220 align:start position:0%
you know I kind of I generally
 
00:13:30.350 --> 00:13:30.360 align:start position:0%
philosophically agree with what you just
 
00:13:31.190 --> 00:13:31.200 align:start position:0%
said so I just want to make sure we're
 
00:13:33.050 --> 00:13:33.060 align:start position:0%
on the same page I think Allowed by rule
 
00:13:35.269 --> 00:13:35.279 align:start position:0%
as opposed to Allowed by Statute simply
 
00:13:36.949 --> 00:13:36.959 align:start position:0%
because the statute process is kind of
 
00:13:38.990 --> 00:13:39.000 align:start position:0%
difficult and we would expect that there
 
00:13:40.750 --> 00:13:40.760 align:start position:0%
may be some revisiting in the future
 
00:13:43.310 --> 00:13:43.320 align:start position:0%
depending on research and understanding
 
00:13:48.470 --> 00:13:48.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:51.110 --> 00:13:51.120 align:start position:0%
so when my thought thought to that is
 
00:13:53.329 --> 00:13:53.339 align:start position:0%
that we are changing this based on
 
00:13:55.910 --> 00:13:55.920 align:start position:0%
Department of Education policy so I
 
00:13:58.870 --> 00:13:58.880 align:start position:0%
guess I would want to specify which rule
 
00:14:02.170 --> 00:14:02.180 align:start position:0%
our rules or their rule
 
00:14:05.090 --> 00:14:05.100 align:start position:0%
whoever's the subject matter actually
 
00:14:07.490 --> 00:14:07.500 align:start position:0%
okay on special education and related
 
00:14:09.590 --> 00:14:09.600 align:start position:0%
services so that's improving to bed
 
00:14:10.970 --> 00:14:10.980 align:start position:0%
they're the subject matter expert I
 
00:14:11.870 --> 00:14:11.880 align:start position:0%
think that's what we want to go with
 
00:14:14.470 --> 00:14:14.480 align:start position:0%
okay I'm just trying to prevent
 
00:14:17.449 --> 00:14:17.459 align:start position:0%
additional committee hearings and build
 
00:14:19.069 --> 00:14:19.079 align:start position:0%
changes on something that we could be a
 
00:14:21.110 --> 00:14:21.120 align:start position:0%
little more vague on to allow it to flow
 
00:14:26.509 --> 00:14:26.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:26.519 --> 00:14:28.129 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:14:28.129 --> 00:14:28.139 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:14:30.350 --> 00:14:30.360 align:start position:0%
I representative page
 
00:14:32.269 --> 00:14:32.279 align:start position:0%
uh could you provide me with a little
 
00:14:35.150 --> 00:14:35.160 align:start position:0%
bit more context on the experiential
 
00:14:37.850 --> 00:14:37.860 align:start position:0%
Wilderness facility piece and you know
 
00:14:41.090 --> 00:14:41.100 align:start position:0%
why that struck why that was problematic
 
00:14:42.769 --> 00:14:42.779 align:start position:0%
um a better understanding sure
 
00:14:44.509 --> 00:14:44.519 align:start position:0%
absolutely thank you for the question
 
00:14:46.490 --> 00:14:46.500 align:start position:0%
um it's we haven't licensed a program
 
00:14:49.009 --> 00:14:49.019 align:start position:0%
under that provision in a very long time
 
00:14:50.990 --> 00:14:51.000 align:start position:0%
we haven't had the need to we've had
 
00:14:52.550 --> 00:14:52.560 align:start position:0%
programs who
 
00:14:55.430 --> 00:14:55.440 align:start position:0%
operated more of a camp type situation
 
00:14:57.470 --> 00:14:57.480 align:start position:0%
and we've been able to do that under our
 
00:14:59.090 --> 00:14:59.100 align:start position:0%
existing rules and statutes without
 
00:15:01.490 --> 00:15:01.500 align:start position:0%
having to have a separate rule set or a
 
00:15:04.189 --> 00:15:04.199 align:start position:0%
separate provision for that type of
 
00:15:07.250 --> 00:15:07.260 align:start position:0%
um agency so we're just trying to it
 
00:15:09.710 --> 00:15:09.720 align:start position:0%
wasn't being used and we are we have had
 
00:15:12.050 --> 00:15:12.060 align:start position:0%
the ability to do that under our current
 
00:15:12.060 --> 00:15:13.850 align:start position:0%
the ability to do that under our current
rules

00:15:13.850 --> 00:15:13.860 align:start position:0%
rules
 
00:15:13.860 --> 00:15:15.350 align:start position:0%
rules
sure

00:15:15.350 --> 00:15:15.360 align:start position:0%
sure
 
00:15:17.509 --> 00:15:17.519 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee
 
00:15:21.050 --> 00:15:21.060 align:start position:0%
okay we can proceed okay thank you
 
00:15:23.870 --> 00:15:23.880 align:start position:0%
all right so the next section is part
 
00:15:26.269 --> 00:15:26.279 align:start position:0%
five which is residential care and child
 
00:15:28.730 --> 00:15:28.740 align:start position:0%
placing agency rule making consultation
 
00:15:32.569 --> 00:15:32.579 align:start position:0%
so this starts on page four line 32-34
 
00:15:34.550 --> 00:15:34.560 align:start position:0%
we are requesting to add to the
 
00:15:36.230 --> 00:15:36.240 align:start position:0%
rulemaking provision the process for
 
00:15:38.329 --> 00:15:38.339 align:start position:0%
requesting waivers to minimum standards
 
00:15:40.250 --> 00:15:40.260 align:start position:0%
for our child residential facilities
 
00:15:42.230 --> 00:15:42.240 align:start position:0%
this is currently part of all other
 
00:15:44.509 --> 00:15:44.519 align:start position:0%
facility licensing and DHHS and this is
 
00:15:46.129 --> 00:15:46.139 align:start position:0%
the one area that we don't have that
 
00:15:48.230 --> 00:15:48.240 align:start position:0%
provision in statute so we're looking to
 
00:15:49.850 --> 00:15:49.860 align:start position:0%
have that alignment and have that
 
00:15:53.810 --> 00:15:53.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:55.910 --> 00:15:55.920 align:start position:0%
representative McWilliams
 
00:15:58.910 --> 00:15:58.920 align:start position:0%
so how is that currently handled
 
00:16:01.310 --> 00:16:01.320 align:start position:0%
if there's a complaint
 
00:16:03.829 --> 00:16:03.839 align:start position:0%
um so it's a waiver process so it's um
 
00:16:06.110 --> 00:16:06.120 align:start position:0%
currently with the residential programs
 
00:16:09.170 --> 00:16:09.180 align:start position:0%
they are required to abide by our rules
 
00:16:10.850 --> 00:16:10.860 align:start position:0%
and there isn't the ability to waive
 
00:16:14.269 --> 00:16:14.279 align:start position:0%
them for residential 24-hour programs So
 
00:16:15.769 --> 00:16:15.779 align:start position:0%
currently we don't have the ability to
 
00:16:17.269 --> 00:16:17.279 align:start position:0%
grant them waivers so we want to have
 
00:16:19.550 --> 00:16:19.560 align:start position:0%
them to have that ability as any as like
 
00:16:22.009 --> 00:16:22.019 align:start position:0%
anybody else thank you sure
 
00:16:25.009 --> 00:16:25.019 align:start position:0%
can you elaborate on that we you can't
 
00:16:26.389 --> 00:16:26.399 align:start position:0%
grant them waivers why wouldn't we just
 
00:16:28.550 --> 00:16:28.560 align:start position:0%
allow it by Statute that's what I'm
 
00:16:29.389 --> 00:16:29.399 align:start position:0%
trying to do that's what you're trying
 
00:16:31.310 --> 00:16:31.320 align:start position:0%
to do yes I'm trying to add that to
 
00:16:32.689 --> 00:16:32.699 align:start position:0%
their statute it's not currently there
 
00:16:34.250 --> 00:16:34.260 align:start position:0%
okay so if we if we have this in there
 
00:16:36.350 --> 00:16:36.360 align:start position:0%
we don't have to issue waivers at all
 
00:16:38.090 --> 00:16:38.100 align:start position:0%
no I'm sorry if
 
00:16:40.670 --> 00:16:40.680 align:start position:0%
um by adding this ability to it's under
 
00:16:43.009 --> 00:16:43.019 align:start position:0%
the rulemaking process so by adding it
 
00:16:46.189 --> 00:16:46.199 align:start position:0%
the ability to have us create rules that
 
00:16:48.290 --> 00:16:48.300 align:start position:0%
allow for waivers we'll be able to add
 
00:16:49.730 --> 00:16:49.740 align:start position:0%
that to a rule then they'll be able to
 
00:16:52.490 --> 00:16:52.500 align:start position:0%
apply for them our rule making statute
 
00:16:54.410 --> 00:16:54.420 align:start position:0%
under residential Child Care programs
 
00:16:57.050 --> 00:16:57.060 align:start position:0%
does not have the ability for waivers so
 
00:16:58.670 --> 00:16:58.680 align:start position:0%
that's what we want to add so we can add
 
00:17:00.410 --> 00:17:00.420 align:start position:0%
it to our rules
 
00:17:03.170 --> 00:17:03.180 align:start position:0%
okay so I could follow I'm just kind of
 
00:17:04.730 --> 00:17:04.740 align:start position:0%
confused why we wouldn't just make it
 
00:17:06.590 --> 00:17:06.600 align:start position:0%
statutes where they could do whatever he
 
00:17:08.090 --> 00:17:08.100 align:start position:0%
was trying to waive or issue a waiver
 
00:17:10.610 --> 00:17:10.620 align:start position:0%
for I don't like waivers I've I don't
 
00:17:12.890 --> 00:17:12.900 align:start position:0%
like the idea of waivers if it's either
 
00:17:14.329 --> 00:17:14.339 align:start position:0%
needs to exist or doesn't exist right
 
00:17:16.010 --> 00:17:16.020 align:start position:0%
like waivers need to be the
 
00:17:19.309 --> 00:17:19.319 align:start position:0%
exception not the default so I guess
 
00:17:20.870 --> 00:17:20.880 align:start position:0%
that's my question I think we're not I
 
00:17:21.710 --> 00:17:21.720 align:start position:0%
don't even know if you're understanding
 
00:17:23.990 --> 00:17:24.000 align:start position:0%
me is if we're allowing you to issue a
 
00:17:27.350 --> 00:17:27.360 align:start position:0%
waiver why wouldn't we just allow
 
00:17:28.669 --> 00:17:28.679 align:start position:0%
whatever it is you're trying to issue
 
00:17:30.230 --> 00:17:30.240 align:start position:0%
the waiver forward to exist in statute
 
00:17:30.240 --> 00:17:31.930 align:start position:0%
the waiver forward to exist in statute
period

00:17:31.930 --> 00:17:31.940 align:start position:0%
period
 
00:17:34.970 --> 00:17:34.980 align:start position:0%
so our the waivers are for the waivers
 
00:17:36.950 --> 00:17:36.960 align:start position:0%
and rules so if we have a certain rule
 
00:17:39.049 --> 00:17:39.059 align:start position:0%
that for whatever the certain
 
00:17:41.990 --> 00:17:42.000 align:start position:0%
circumstances of the program doesn't fit
 
00:17:44.029 --> 00:17:44.039 align:start position:0%
what we have in rule we can then our
 
00:17:45.529 --> 00:17:45.539 align:start position:0%
value that fits the intent of the rules
 
00:17:47.450 --> 00:17:47.460 align:start position:0%
so that they can do what they need to do
 
00:17:49.909 --> 00:17:49.919 align:start position:0%
to operate and then we can grant a
 
00:17:51.230 --> 00:17:51.240 align:start position:0%
waiver to the rule they have that
 
00:17:52.850 --> 00:17:52.860 align:start position:0%
ability I understand so you can't
 
00:17:53.810 --> 00:17:53.820 align:start position:0%
currently grant them for these
 
00:17:55.549 --> 00:17:55.559 align:start position:0%
facilities at all this gives you more
 
00:17:56.990 --> 00:17:57.000 align:start position:0%
flexibility inside of it for a cart
 
00:17:58.789 --> 00:17:58.799 align:start position:0%
block if there's exceptions okay all
 
00:18:00.169 --> 00:18:00.179 align:start position:0%
right all right we can move on sorry I
 
00:18:01.909 --> 00:18:01.919 align:start position:0%
was a little confused there for a second
 
00:18:03.950 --> 00:18:03.960 align:start position:0%
but you got me back all right no my
 
00:18:05.570 --> 00:18:05.580 align:start position:0%
apologies if it wasn't clear so I'm glad
 
00:18:07.250 --> 00:18:07.260 align:start position:0%
we're there thank you for the
 
00:18:09.289 --> 00:18:09.299 align:start position:0%
clarification all right so under part
 
00:18:11.990 --> 00:18:12.000 align:start position:0%
six Recreation camp licensing
 
00:18:15.190 --> 00:18:15.200 align:start position:0%
definitions this is on page four line 35
 
00:18:17.930 --> 00:18:17.940 align:start position:0%
through page five line two
 
00:18:19.610 --> 00:18:19.620 align:start position:0%
we're requesting a change to the
 
00:18:21.350 --> 00:18:21.360 align:start position:0%
definition of recreation Camp by
 
00:18:24.049 --> 00:18:24.059 align:start position:0%
changing boys and girls to children and
 
00:18:26.029 --> 00:18:26.039 align:start position:0%
then to add that the definition does not
 
00:18:28.250 --> 00:18:28.260 align:start position:0%
apply to group day care centers and
 
00:18:31.430 --> 00:18:31.440 align:start position:0%
preschool programs as defined under RSA
 
00:18:33.950 --> 00:18:33.960 align:start position:0%
170 E2 so that would be our child day
 
00:18:36.770 --> 00:18:36.780 align:start position:0%
care statute which will create Clarity
 
00:18:37.970 --> 00:18:37.980 align:start position:0%
for the public and the department
 
00:18:39.770 --> 00:18:39.780 align:start position:0%
regarding which type of license and
 
00:18:42.289 --> 00:18:42.299 align:start position:0%
entity is required to obtain to provide
 
00:18:44.390 --> 00:18:44.400 align:start position:0%
you with a little context there child
 
00:18:45.850 --> 00:18:45.860 align:start position:0%
care licensing
 
00:18:49.610 --> 00:18:49.620 align:start position:0%
was given the authority to license camps
 
00:18:53.390 --> 00:18:53.400 align:start position:0%
starting 2020 it was currently licensed
 
00:18:54.830 --> 00:18:54.840 align:start position:0%
under the Department of Environmental
 
00:18:57.529 --> 00:18:57.539 align:start position:0%
Services since for a really long time
 
00:18:59.870 --> 00:18:59.880 align:start position:0%
and they you know it wasn't really the
 
00:19:01.549 --> 00:19:01.559 align:start position:0%
right place for it so they've brought it
 
00:19:04.730 --> 00:19:04.740 align:start position:0%
over to us as we've been working through
 
00:19:06.470 --> 00:19:06.480 align:start position:0%
the camp licensing and obviously the
 
00:19:07.789 --> 00:19:07.799 align:start position:0%
first year we had it was the first big
 
00:19:09.049 --> 00:19:09.059 align:start position:0%
year of covid there weren't a lot of
 
00:19:11.150 --> 00:19:11.160 align:start position:0%
camps operating so we've been learning
 
00:19:12.890 --> 00:19:12.900 align:start position:0%
over the past few Summers about what
 
00:19:14.690 --> 00:19:14.700 align:start position:0%
that looks like we're finding it
 
00:19:17.330 --> 00:19:17.340 align:start position:0%
increasingly challenging to identify if
 
00:19:19.190 --> 00:19:19.200 align:start position:0%
someone says hey I want to run this
 
00:19:21.049 --> 00:19:21.059 align:start position:0%
program for children and this is what
 
00:19:22.970 --> 00:19:22.980 align:start position:0%
we're going to be doing they could fit
 
00:19:25.310 --> 00:19:25.320 align:start position:0%
under either statute and we're trying to
 
00:19:26.450 --> 00:19:26.460 align:start position:0%
make sure there's a little more clarity
 
00:19:28.490 --> 00:19:28.500 align:start position:0%
as to which statute they need to follow
 
00:19:32.090 --> 00:19:32.100 align:start position:0%
so we're exempting their ability to have
 
00:19:34.130 --> 00:19:34.140 align:start position:0%
a camp license if they fit the
 
00:19:36.529 --> 00:19:36.539 align:start position:0%
definition of our group daycare or
 
00:19:38.990 --> 00:19:39.000 align:start position:0%
preschool programs as currently defined
 
00:19:43.610 --> 00:19:43.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:45.830 --> 00:19:45.840 align:start position:0%
and then if I move along to part seven
 
00:19:48.590 --> 00:19:48.600 align:start position:0%
that's okay under Recreation camp
 
00:19:50.810 --> 00:19:50.820 align:start position:0%
licensing confidentiality of an
 
00:19:52.850 --> 00:19:52.860 align:start position:0%
investigations we're requesting a new
 
00:19:54.650 --> 00:19:54.660 align:start position:0%
section to align with other licensed
 
00:19:56.270 --> 00:19:56.280 align:start position:0%
facilities in the department regarding
 
00:19:58.010 --> 00:19:58.020 align:start position:0%
the conducting of Investigations of
 
00:20:00.230 --> 00:20:00.240 align:start position:0%
complaints received for non-compliance
 
00:20:01.789 --> 00:20:01.799 align:start position:0%
of Licensing standards and the
 
00:20:03.529 --> 00:20:03.539 align:start position:0%
maintaining of confidentiality of the
 
00:20:05.090 --> 00:20:05.100 align:start position:0%
records compiled during investigations
 
00:20:07.490 --> 00:20:07.500 align:start position:0%
by the department when we adopted the
 
00:20:09.110 --> 00:20:09.120 align:start position:0%
camp program from the Department of
 
00:20:10.789 --> 00:20:10.799 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services they didn't have
 
00:20:12.590 --> 00:20:12.600 align:start position:0%
any provisions for investigation of
 
00:20:14.270 --> 00:20:14.280 align:start position:0%
complaints in the confidentiality of
 
00:20:16.549 --> 00:20:16.559 align:start position:0%
those investigations so we're looking to
 
00:20:20.090 --> 00:20:20.100 align:start position:0%
align what we do with our child care and
 
00:20:22.490 --> 00:20:22.500 align:start position:0%
other licensed facility programming in
 
00:20:24.110 --> 00:20:24.120 align:start position:0%
the department and bringing camp
 
00:20:24.120 --> 00:20:25.370 align:start position:0%
the department and bringing camp
licensing

00:20:25.370 --> 00:20:25.380 align:start position:0%
licensing
 
00:20:28.430 --> 00:20:28.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:31.669 --> 00:20:31.679 align:start position:0%
and that's it for my testimony and I'm
 
00:20:35.510 --> 00:20:35.520 align:start position:0%
happy to take any additional questions
 
00:20:38.690 --> 00:20:38.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:40.610 --> 00:20:40.620 align:start position:0%
thank you um just wanted to ask for
 
00:20:43.430 --> 00:20:43.440 align:start position:0%
clarity for the purposes of notes so
 
00:20:44.810 --> 00:20:44.820 align:start position:0%
um you were saying you were finding that
 
00:20:46.610 --> 00:20:46.620 align:start position:0%
many camp programs could fit under
 
00:20:48.409 --> 00:20:48.419 align:start position:0%
either the camp definition or the
 
00:20:50.930 --> 00:20:50.940 align:start position:0%
daycare definition and so now you're
 
00:20:53.029 --> 00:20:53.039 align:start position:0%
saying anything that goes that can fit
 
00:20:54.230 --> 00:20:54.240 align:start position:0%
under daycare should go under that
 
00:20:56.450 --> 00:20:56.460 align:start position:0%
otherwise Camp okay yes thank you yes
 
00:20:58.070 --> 00:20:58.080 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question the clarity
 
00:21:01.490 --> 00:21:01.500 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee
 
00:21:03.409 --> 00:21:03.419 align:start position:0%
all right sing none thank you okay thank
 
00:21:05.750 --> 00:21:05.760 align:start position:0%
you very much
 
00:21:07.970 --> 00:21:07.980 align:start position:0%
uh no is there anyone else wishing to
 
00:21:11.090 --> 00:21:11.100 align:start position:0%
speak to Senate Bill 94
 
00:21:12.650 --> 00:21:12.660 align:start position:0%
um if not representative Neil can you
 
00:21:15.049 --> 00:21:15.059 align:start position:0%
grab me the blue sheet for Senate I know
 
00:21:15.890 --> 00:21:15.900 align:start position:0%
it's kind of awkward going to walk

legislation to increase our child care
 
00:33:10.029 --> 00:33:10.039 align:start position:0%
capacity in New Hampshire
 
00:33:13.250 --> 00:33:13.260 align:start position:0%
sp170 would create a new regulatory
 
00:33:14.990 --> 00:33:15.000 align:start position:0%
category of daycare that allows
 
00:33:17.149 --> 00:33:17.159 align:start position:0%
licensing for 6 to 12 children outside
 
00:33:19.610 --> 00:33:19.620 align:start position:0%
of a residential setting and listening
 
00:33:21.470 --> 00:33:21.480 align:start position:0%
to our small businesses they said that
 
00:33:23.810 --> 00:33:23.820 align:start position:0%
finding a location to start a new child
 
00:33:25.789 --> 00:33:25.799 align:start position:0%
care business was their biggest barrier
 
00:33:27.710 --> 00:33:27.720 align:start position:0%
and this bill is intended to be
 
00:33:29.509 --> 00:33:29.519 align:start position:0%
responsive to that need
 
00:33:33.049 --> 00:33:33.059 align:start position:0%
in addition SB 170 clarifies the law to
 
00:33:34.730 --> 00:33:34.740 align:start position:0%
be consistent with fire code regulation
 
00:33:36.590 --> 00:33:36.600 align:start position:0%
concerning the presence of school-aged
 
00:33:38.570 --> 00:33:38.580 align:start position:0%
children on site at a licensed facility
 
00:33:40.850 --> 00:33:40.860 align:start position:0%
we understand this to be a needed change
 
00:33:42.649 --> 00:33:42.659 align:start position:0%
the fire marshal can speak to and we
 
00:33:45.110 --> 00:33:45.120 align:start position:0%
have also made
 
00:33:48.169 --> 00:33:48.179 align:start position:0%
um some changes in the sentence process
 
00:33:51.230 --> 00:33:51.240 align:start position:0%
to make sure that um as amended the bill
 
00:33:53.149 --> 00:33:53.159 align:start position:0%
reflected the fact that our goal of
 
00:33:55.310 --> 00:33:55.320 align:start position:0%
everyone's goal is to increase capacity
 
00:33:56.750 --> 00:33:56.760 align:start position:0%
for child care in the state and make
 
00:33:58.490 --> 00:33:58.500 align:start position:0%
sure that we're not um
 
00:34:00.950 --> 00:34:00.960 align:start position:0%
changing any existing capacity that's on
 
00:34:00.960 --> 00:34:01.870 align:start position:0%
changing any existing capacity that's on
site

00:34:01.870 --> 00:34:01.880 align:start position:0%
site
 
00:34:04.070 --> 00:34:04.080 align:start position:0%
sp170 is the result of collaborative
 
00:34:05.990 --> 00:34:06.000 align:start position:0%
working group that includes providers
 
00:34:08.389 --> 00:34:08.399 align:start position:0%
the child care licensing licensing unit
 
00:34:10.190 --> 00:34:10.200 align:start position:0%
and the Fire Marshal's Office this group
 
00:34:12.530 --> 00:34:12.540 align:start position:0%
met throughout last fall to bring you
 
00:34:13.970 --> 00:34:13.980 align:start position:0%

the piece of legislation in front of you
today

today
 
00:34:17.030 --> 00:34:17.040 align:start position:0%
currently and I don't need to tell this
 
00:34:19.669 --> 00:34:19.679 align:start position:0%
committee this I suppose but 46 percent
 
00:34:21.470 --> 00:34:21.480 align:start position:0%
of people live in child care deserts
 
00:34:23.089 --> 00:34:23.099 align:start position:0%
where there are three children waiting
 
00:34:25.310 --> 00:34:25.320 align:start position:0%
for every one available space this bill
 
00:34:27.109 --> 00:34:27.119 align:start position:0%
introduces a critical Solution by
 
00:34:29.210 --> 00:34:29.220 align:start position:0%
providing Child Care opportunities to 29
 
00:34:31.790 --> 00:34:31.800 align:start position:0%
more children freeing up parents to join
 
00:34:33.770 --> 00:34:33.780 align:start position:0%
the workforce a style of small group
 
00:34:35.270 --> 00:34:35.280 align:start position:0%
daycare also provides the flexibility
 
00:34:37.430 --> 00:34:37.440 align:start position:0%
and enrollment that is typical of a
 
00:34:38.750 --> 00:34:38.760 align:start position:0%
home-based daycare
 
00:34:40.550 --> 00:34:40.560 align:start position:0%
by creating new available commercial
 
00:34:42.349 --> 00:34:42.359 align:start position:0%
spaces for our child care businesses it
 
00:34:43.490 --> 00:34:43.500 align:start position:0%
would help break the single biggest
 
00:34:47.030 --> 00:34:47.040 align:start position:0%
barrier to child care location
 
00:34:47.040 --> 00:34:48.770 align:start position:0%
barrier to child care location

to write the bill
 
00:37:00.890 --> 00:37:00.900 align:start position:0%
um so I am very knowledgeable of most of
 
00:37:03.050 --> 00:37:03.060 align:start position:0%
the details of this at this point
 
00:37:04.849 --> 00:37:04.859 align:start position:0%
um we had a really great group working
 
00:37:06.290 --> 00:37:06.300 align:start position:0%
with us throughout the year of subject
 
00:37:08.150 --> 00:37:08.160 align:start position:0%
matter experts on this bill so a lot of
 
00:37:10.490 --> 00:37:10.500 align:start position:0%
time and effort has gone into it
 
00:37:10.500 --> 00:37:11.569 align:start position:0%
time and effort has gone into it
um

00:37:11.569 --> 00:37:11.579 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:37:14.210 --> 00:37:14.220 align:start position:0%

00:37:15.470 --> 00:37:15.480 align:start position:0%
um and I worked with Senator Coco
 
00:37:17.329 --> 00:37:17.339 align:start position:0%
writing and researching SB 170
 
00:37:19.130 --> 00:37:19.140 align:start position:0%
increasing Child Care capacity for New
 
00:37:21.470 --> 00:37:21.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire the bill before you represents
 
00:37:23.569 --> 00:37:23.579 align:start position:0%
a simple and efficient way for the state
 
00:37:25.190 --> 00:37:25.200 align:start position:0%
to allow for child care capacity
 
00:37:28.609 --> 00:37:28.619 align:start position:0%
building simply by capitalizing on all
 
00:37:30.710 --> 00:37:30.720 align:start position:0%
allowable spaces permitted by the fire
 
00:37:32.930 --> 00:37:32.940 align:start position:0%
codes this simple bill has the ability
 
00:37:35.870 --> 00:37:35.880 align:start position:0%
to increase capacity by 29 in the state
 
00:37:37.849 --> 00:37:37.859 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire amassing that you
 
00:37:40.190 --> 00:37:40.200 align:start position:0%
support SB 170 with a recommendation of
 
00:37:41.450 --> 00:37:41.460 align:start position:0%
ought to pass
 
00:37:44.150 --> 00:37:44.160 align:start position:0%
I began writing sv-170 last year in
 
00:37:45.829 --> 00:37:45.839 align:start position:0%
response to a gap I found in child care
 
00:37:48.050 --> 00:37:48.060 align:start position:0%
licensing rules and fire codes that
 
00:37:49.790 --> 00:37:49.800 align:start position:0%
could provide an opportunity to create a
 
00:37:51.770 --> 00:37:51.780 align:start position:0%
new category for child care John
 
00:37:53.810 --> 00:37:53.820 align:start position:0%
Randolph from Harmony Homes was seeking
 
00:37:55.730 --> 00:37:55.740 align:start position:0%
a pathway to incorporate both affordable
 
00:37:58.190 --> 00:37:58.200 align:start position:0%
housing and on-site Child Care into
 
00:37:59.690 --> 00:37:59.700 align:start position:0%
their business model
 
00:38:01.670 --> 00:38:01.680 align:start position:0%
I worked collaboratively drafting the
 
00:38:03.410 --> 00:38:03.420 align:start position:0%
bill language with Melissa Clement of
 
00:38:05.569 --> 00:38:05.579 align:start position:0%
child care licensing Mitch Katie from
 
00:38:07.190 --> 00:38:07.200 align:start position:0%
the Fire Marshal's office building
 
00:38:09.170 --> 00:38:09.180 align:start position:0%
inspectors Architects and many
 
00:38:12.050 --> 00:38:12.060 align:start position:0%
stakeholders in the Child Care community
 
00:38:14.569 --> 00:38:14.579 align:start position:0%
the bill is presented would not only
 
00:38:16.430 --> 00:38:16.440 align:start position:0%
preserve the existing capacity in
 
00:38:18.589 --> 00:38:18.599 align:start position:0%
licensed family care but will serve to
 
00:38:20.270 --> 00:38:20.280 align:start position:0%
create a new opportunity to increase
 
00:38:22.250 --> 00:38:22.260 align:start position:0%
capacity for child care in New Hampshire
 
00:38:24.950 --> 00:38:24.960 align:start position:0%
through the creation of small centers by
 
00:38:26.750 --> 00:38:26.760 align:start position:0%
adding Child Care opportunities for 12
 
00:38:29.930 --> 00:38:29.940 align:start position:0%
children in each new center created the
 
00:38:32.210 --> 00:38:32.220 align:start position:0%
small centers that will be created out
 
00:38:33.470 --> 00:38:33.480 align:start position:0%
of the adoption of the bill would be
 
00:38:35.329 --> 00:38:35.339 align:start position:0%
beneficial in Workforce housing units
 
00:38:38.630 --> 00:38:38.640 align:start position:0%
rural areas the hospitality industry and
 
00:38:40.910 --> 00:38:40.920 align:start position:0%
for businesses like Harmony Homes and
 
00:38:42.710 --> 00:38:42.720 align:start position:0%
Carriage Hill Assisted Living
 
00:38:44.569 --> 00:38:44.579 align:start position:0%
there is an absolute need to preserve
 
00:38:46.310 --> 00:38:46.320 align:start position:0%
every child care space we have in the
 
00:38:47.630 --> 00:38:47.640 align:start position:0%
state and the need to provide
 
00:38:49.609 --> 00:38:49.619 align:start position:0%
opportunities for growth as there are
 
00:38:51.530 --> 00:38:51.540 align:start position:0%
over 2 000 children we are unable to
 
00:38:54.530 --> 00:38:54.540 align:start position:0%
serve which means 29 of our Workforce is
 
00:38:56.930 --> 00:38:56.940 align:start position:0%
unable to return to work I am asking
 
00:38:58.849 --> 00:38:58.859 align:start position:0%
that you support SB 170 with a
 
00:39:03.109 --> 00:39:03.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:05.270 --> 00:39:05.280 align:start position:0%
will you be taking questions
 
00:39:06.950 --> 00:39:06.960 align:start position:0%
are there like are there questions from
 
00:39:08.390 --> 00:39:08.400 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
00:39:20.150 --> 00:39:20.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:23.210 --> 00:39:23.220 align:start position:0%
so small child care centers it's defined
 
00:39:26.990 --> 00:39:27.000 align:start position:0%
by NFPA 101 so the fire marshal could
 
00:39:28.609 --> 00:39:28.619 align:start position:0%
actually speak a little bit more clearly
 
00:39:29.890 --> 00:39:29.900 align:start position:0%
to that
 
00:39:31.910 --> 00:39:31.920 align:start position:0%
okay for the question I representative
 
00:39:31.920 --> 00:39:35.089 align:start position:0%
okay for the question I representative
claims

00:39:35.089 --> 00:39:35.099 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:36.829 --> 00:39:36.839 align:start position:0%
so I just want to ask the same question
 
00:39:39.950 --> 00:39:39.960 align:start position:0%
I asked before about this um striking up
 
00:39:41.810 --> 00:39:41.820 align:start position:0%
to three children attending a full day
 
00:39:43.550 --> 00:39:43.560 align:start position:0%
school program may be cared for up to
 
00:39:45.290 --> 00:39:45.300 align:start position:0%
five hours per day
 
00:39:47.210 --> 00:39:47.220 align:start position:0%
on school days and all day during school
 
00:39:49.190 --> 00:39:49.200 align:start position:0%
holidays is sort of this Flex time thing
 
00:39:50.930 --> 00:39:50.940 align:start position:0%
where you could take extra kids but
 
00:39:52.550 --> 00:39:52.560 align:start position:0%
we're removing it can you just give a
 
00:39:54.109 --> 00:39:54.119 align:start position:0%
little background as to what happened
 
00:39:56.270 --> 00:39:56.280 align:start position:0%
there so again that's something the fire
 
00:39:57.770 --> 00:39:57.780 align:start position:0%
marshal can probably speak to a little
 
00:40:00.109 --> 00:40:00.119 align:start position:0%
bit more clearly than me but the way the
 
00:40:01.670 --> 00:40:01.680 align:start position:0%
fire codes are written to my
 
00:40:03.290 --> 00:40:03.300 align:start position:0%
understanding is that the capacity is
 
00:40:05.089 --> 00:40:05.099 align:start position:0%
just for the number of children not for
 
00:40:08.030 --> 00:40:08.040 align:start position:0%
the ages of the children and the variety
 
00:40:09.950 --> 00:40:09.960 align:start position:0%
of children that are allowed so by
 
00:40:11.630 --> 00:40:11.640 align:start position:0%
strictly going to 12 you would still
 
00:40:14.569 --> 00:40:14.579 align:start position:0%
have the capacity to take up to 12
 
00:40:16.130 --> 00:40:16.140 align:start position:0%
children during holidays vacations
 
00:40:17.870 --> 00:40:17.880 align:start position:0%
weekend so you would still be able to do
 
00:40:19.790 --> 00:40:19.800 align:start position:0%
that okay so it's a fire code thing
 
00:40:21.710 --> 00:40:21.720 align:start position:0%
thank you very much further questions
 
00:40:24.170 --> 00:40:24.180 align:start position:0%
from the committee
 
00:40:26.150 --> 00:40:26.160 align:start position:0%
I'm saying none thank you Jen I'm sorry
 
00:40:28.849 --> 00:40:28.859 align:start position:0%
I like spaced we had like an hour-long
 
00:40:30.349 --> 00:40:30.359 align:start position:0%
conversation on Zoom like it's not like
 
00:40:31.790 --> 00:40:31.800 align:start position:0%
I don't know who you are
 
00:40:31.800 --> 00:40:33.109 align:start position:0%
I don't know who you are
um

00:40:33.109 --> 00:40:33.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:40:37.609 --> 00:40:37.619 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:44.569 --> 00:40:44.579 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:47.089 --> 00:40:47.099 align:start position:0%
Cal from Early Learning New Hampshire we
 
00:40:49.250 --> 00:40:49.260 align:start position:0%
are a Statewide non-profit
 
00:40:51.349 --> 00:40:51.359 align:start position:0%
um who uh represent Child Care programs
 
00:40:54.290 --> 00:40:54.300 align:start position:0%
and the families they serve and um we're
 
00:40:55.730 --> 00:40:55.740 align:start position:0%
in support of this bill and when this
 
00:40:57.950 --> 00:40:57.960 align:start position:0%
bill was created as Jen mentioned she
 
00:40:59.870 --> 00:40:59.880 align:start position:0%
really worked with a lot of people and
 
00:41:01.490 --> 00:41:01.500 align:start position:0%
we did find a few glitches in the very
 
00:41:02.930 --> 00:41:02.940 align:start position:0%
beginning and people were very
 
00:41:06.710 --> 00:41:06.720 align:start position:0%
responsive and um we co-host with nine
 
00:41:09.109 --> 00:41:09.119 align:start position:0%
other organizations twice a month the
 
00:41:10.810 --> 00:41:10.820 align:start position:0%
zoom calls with the Child Care community
 
00:41:13.370 --> 00:41:13.380 align:start position:0%
and back in the day before Zoom we used
 
00:41:14.930 --> 00:41:14.940 align:start position:0%
to have about 20 people who could show
 
00:41:17.270 --> 00:41:17.280 align:start position:0%
up to monthly meetings now we have twice
 
00:41:18.770 --> 00:41:18.780 align:start position:0%
a month meetings and there's over a
 
00:41:21.829 --> 00:41:21.839 align:start position:0%
hundred every every time so people can't
 
00:41:23.990 --> 00:41:24.000 align:start position:0%
get out as you know very well they can't
 
00:41:25.370 --> 00:41:25.380 align:start position:0%
get out of the building they couldn't
 
00:41:27.349 --> 00:41:27.359 align:start position:0%
even before the pandemic now they really
 
00:41:29.270 --> 00:41:29.280 align:start position:0%
can't so so
 
00:41:31.790 --> 00:41:31.800 align:start position:0%
um Jen came to those meetings and talked
 
00:41:33.710 --> 00:41:33.720 align:start position:0%
about the bill and um so we're very
 
00:41:35.650 --> 00:41:35.660 align:start position:0%
supportive of this bill
 
00:41:38.089 --> 00:41:38.099 align:start position:0%
uh will you be taking questions yes I
 
00:41:39.170 --> 00:41:39.180 align:start position:0%
will thank you any questions from the
 
00:41:39.180 --> 00:41:40.430 align:start position:0%
will thank you any questions from the
committee

00:41:40.430 --> 00:41:40.440 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:41:43.190 --> 00:41:43.200 align:start position:0%
arrested represent Warner
 
00:41:45.650 --> 00:41:45.660 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
00:41:47.390 --> 00:41:47.400 align:start position:0%
um Miss Cal
 
00:41:47.400 --> 00:41:48.530 align:start position:0%
um Miss Cal
so

00:41:48.530 --> 00:41:48.540 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:41:51.349 --> 00:41:51.359 align:start position:0%
even though the Senate did I thought a
 
00:41:54.829 --> 00:41:54.839 align:start position:0%
good amendment to allow family child
 
00:41:57.290 --> 00:41:57.300 align:start position:0%
care providers who now are caring for
 
00:41:59.390 --> 00:41:59.400 align:start position:0%
the extra children right after school
 
00:42:03.589 --> 00:42:03.599 align:start position:0%
and on holidays potentially as time goes
 
00:42:06.770 --> 00:42:06.780 align:start position:0%
by they'll be limited and do we have any
 
00:42:10.849 --> 00:42:10.859 align:start position:0%
idea how many spaces we are losing
 
00:42:14.569 --> 00:42:14.579 align:start position:0%
because of this action because it seems
 
00:42:17.450 --> 00:42:17.460 align:start position:0%
like this is a really important piece
 
00:42:20.210 --> 00:42:20.220 align:start position:0%
for families if your younger child goes
 
00:42:22.730 --> 00:42:22.740 align:start position:0%
to a family child care provider and your
 
00:42:24.710 --> 00:42:24.720 align:start position:0%
older child can go after school for an
 
00:42:27.770 --> 00:42:27.780 align:start position:0%
hour or two and so potentially I think
 
00:42:29.930 --> 00:42:29.940 align:start position:0%
there is going to be a loss of capacity
 
00:42:31.430 --> 00:42:31.440 align:start position:0%
thank you for that question I think
 
00:42:33.290 --> 00:42:33.300 align:start position:0%
that's something we'll want to watch one
 
00:42:34.849 --> 00:42:34.859 align:start position:0%
of the things we did do
 
00:42:37.730 --> 00:42:37.740 align:start position:0%
um based on the concern that current
 
00:42:39.109 --> 00:42:39.119 align:start position:0%
providers if there hadn't been a
 
00:42:41.750 --> 00:42:41.760 align:start position:0%
grandfathering current providers would
 
00:42:43.670 --> 00:42:43.680 align:start position:0%
have been able to serve fewer after
 
00:42:45.890 --> 00:42:45.900 align:start position:0%
school kids so even though they were
 
00:42:47.930 --> 00:42:47.940 align:start position:0%
grandfathered there's the point of these
 
00:42:49.490 --> 00:42:49.500 align:start position:0%
people then you know there'll be other
 
00:42:51.710 --> 00:42:51.720 align:start position:0%
people coming in who can't do what they
 
00:42:53.750 --> 00:42:53.760 align:start position:0%
used to do in terms of watching after
 
00:42:56.270 --> 00:42:56.280 align:start position:0%
school kids I don't have the stats on
 
00:42:58.130 --> 00:42:58.140 align:start position:0%
how many children are would be affected
 
00:43:00.470 --> 00:43:00.480 align:start position:0%
by that but it is very common for small
 
00:43:03.410 --> 00:43:03.420 align:start position:0%
sites family me to have the baby there
 
00:43:05.270 --> 00:43:05.280 align:start position:0%
the preschooler there in the after
 
00:43:07.190 --> 00:43:07.200 align:start position:0%
school child there and it is great for
 
00:43:07.200 --> 00:43:09.770 align:start position:0%
school child there and it is great for
families

00:43:09.770 --> 00:43:09.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:11.630 --> 00:43:11.640 align:start position:0%
so I think we should watch that
 
00:43:14.690 --> 00:43:14.700 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee
 
00:43:16.370 --> 00:43:16.380 align:start position:0%
thank you so much
 
00:43:20.690 --> 00:43:20.700 align:start position:0%
um last up DHHS Melissa Clement I assume
 
00:43:21.770 --> 00:43:21.780 align:start position:0%
it's the same thing as before we just
 
00:43:22.970 --> 00:43:22.980 align:start position:0%
bring you up and if we need others we
 
00:43:33.970 --> 00:43:33.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:36.109 --> 00:43:36.119 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair members of the
 
00:43:36.119 --> 00:43:37.069 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair members of the
committee

00:43:37.069 --> 00:43:37.079 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:43:38.809 --> 00:43:38.819 align:start position:0%
um for the record I'm Melissa Clement
 
00:43:39.770 --> 00:43:39.780 align:start position:0%
I'm the chief of the child care
 
00:43:41.270 --> 00:43:41.280 align:start position:0%
licensing unit for the Department of
 
00:43:44.270 --> 00:43:44.280 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services and
 
00:43:46.910 --> 00:43:46.920 align:start position:0%
um Senate Bill 170
 
00:43:48.410 --> 00:43:48.420 align:start position:0%
um this legislation creates a new
 
00:43:50.450 --> 00:43:50.460 align:start position:0%
category which you've heard before but
 
00:43:52.790 --> 00:43:52.800 align:start position:0%
I'll you know reiterate creates a new
 
00:43:54.710 --> 00:43:54.720 align:start position:0%
category of care for children up to 12
 
00:43:57.050 --> 00:43:57.060 align:start position:0%
children in a location other than a
 
00:43:59.030 --> 00:43:59.040 align:start position:0%
provider's home we currently do not have
 
00:44:01.010 --> 00:44:01.020 align:start position:0%
rules around that type of category of
 
00:44:02.930 --> 00:44:02.940 align:start position:0%
care and so those rules will be
 
00:44:05.089 --> 00:44:05.099 align:start position:0%
developed for this category and specific
 
00:44:06.890 --> 00:44:06.900 align:start position:0%
to the needs of a small child care
 
00:44:09.050 --> 00:44:09.060 align:start position:0%
setting in a setting other than the
 
00:44:11.569 --> 00:44:11.579 align:start position:0%
child provider's home
 
00:44:13.670 --> 00:44:13.680 align:start position:0%
um in addition this legislation aligns
 
00:44:16.030 --> 00:44:16.040 align:start position:0%
the statute with the life safety codes
 
00:44:18.530 --> 00:44:18.540 align:start position:0%
capacities for Family Daycare homes and
 
00:44:20.630 --> 00:44:20.640 align:start position:0%
family group daycare homes for Family
 
00:44:22.609 --> 00:44:22.619 align:start position:0%
Day Care the definition changes the
 
00:44:25.190 --> 00:44:25.200 align:start position:0%
capacity to six children and for family
 
00:44:27.170 --> 00:44:27.180 align:start position:0%
group daycare that changes the capacity
 
00:44:29.750 --> 00:44:29.760 align:start position:0%
to 12 children current statute permits
 
00:44:31.730 --> 00:44:31.740 align:start position:0%
the addition of school-aged children
 
00:44:34.010 --> 00:44:34.020 align:start position:0%
three for family child care and five for
 
00:44:35.930 --> 00:44:35.940 align:start position:0%
family group child care which is in
 
00:44:37.609 --> 00:44:37.619 align:start position:0%
conflict with the Life Safety Code for
 
00:44:39.349 --> 00:44:39.359 align:start position:0%
these categories of care
 
00:44:41.990 --> 00:44:42.000 align:start position:0%
these changes will only impact new
 
00:44:43.910 --> 00:44:43.920 align:start position:0%
programs licensed on or after the
 
00:44:46.190 --> 00:44:46.200 align:start position:0%
effective date of these rules unless the
 
00:44:47.630 --> 00:44:47.640 align:start position:0%
program is licensed prior to the
 
00:44:49.490 --> 00:44:49.500 align:start position:0%
enactment Do Not renew or their license
 
00:44:51.710 --> 00:44:51.720 align:start position:0%
becomes no longer valid
 
00:44:54.470 --> 00:44:54.480 align:start position:0%
and the new category of care will create
 
00:44:56.329 --> 00:44:56.339 align:start position:0%
more opportunities for child care
 
00:44:58.190 --> 00:44:58.200 align:start position:0%
programs with 12 or fewer children to
 
00:45:00.170 --> 00:45:00.180 align:start position:0%
operate in locations outside of a
 
00:45:02.030 --> 00:45:02.040 align:start position:0%
proprietor's home which will potentially
 
00:45:03.890 --> 00:45:03.900 align:start position:0%
increase the number of child care
 
00:45:05.690 --> 00:45:05.700 align:start position:0%
programs operating which create more
 
00:45:07.849 --> 00:45:07.859 align:start position:0%
child care options for families we find
 
00:45:09.950 --> 00:45:09.960 align:start position:0%
this is particularly true in smaller
 
00:45:11.930 --> 00:45:11.940 align:start position:0%
towns they don't have the ability to
 
00:45:15.410 --> 00:45:15.420 align:start position:0%
have a program that is large 25 50
 
00:45:16.910 --> 00:45:16.920 align:start position:0%
because they can't either they don't
 
00:45:17.870 --> 00:45:17.880 align:start position:0%
have enough staff or they don't have
 
00:45:19.670 --> 00:45:19.680 align:start position:0%
enough children to fund them so having a
 
00:45:23.750 --> 00:45:23.760 align:start position:0%
smaller category of care with different
 
00:45:25.609 --> 00:45:25.619 align:start position:0%
um operational costs would be easier
 
00:45:28.510 --> 00:45:28.520 align:start position:0%
underneath that having a small category
 
00:45:32.270 --> 00:45:32.280 align:start position:0%
and I will proactively answer some of
 
00:45:34.010 --> 00:45:34.020 align:start position:0%
the questions I heard before but feel
 
00:45:37.609 --> 00:45:37.619 align:start position:0%
free to ask some more so we currently
 
00:45:37.619 --> 00:45:39.470 align:start position:0%
free to ask some more so we currently
have

00:45:39.470 --> 00:45:39.480 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:45:42.109 --> 00:45:42.119 align:start position:0%
um about for family family group Child
 
00:45:44.329 --> 00:45:44.339 align:start position:0%
Care programs we have 122 and
 
00:45:45.890 --> 00:45:45.900 align:start position:0%
representative walner I heard you're
 
00:45:47.390 --> 00:45:47.400 align:start position:0%
concerned about what may happen in the
 
00:45:47.400 --> 00:45:48.230 align:start position:0%
concerned about what may happen in the
future

00:45:48.230 --> 00:45:48.240 align:start position:0%
future
 
00:45:51.290 --> 00:45:51.300 align:start position:0%
it I don't see it impacting a family
 
00:45:54.170 --> 00:45:54.180 align:start position:0%
Child Care Program as much so the
 
00:45:55.970 --> 00:45:55.980 align:start position:0%
individual provider because they will be
 
00:45:57.829 --> 00:45:57.839 align:start position:0%
able to be licensed at Family group and
 
00:46:00.349 --> 00:46:00.359 align:start position:0%
still have the nine children so that
 
00:46:02.030 --> 00:46:02.040 align:start position:0%
they'll just be a family group instead
 
00:46:04.069 --> 00:46:04.079 align:start position:0%
of family child care so that option
 
00:46:06.650 --> 00:46:06.660 align:start position:0%
won't be lost for those it's I could
 
00:46:09.589 --> 00:46:09.599 align:start position:0%
potentially see I to your point about in
 
00:46:11.270 --> 00:46:11.280 align:start position:0%
the future people will not be able to
 
00:46:13.430 --> 00:46:13.440 align:start position:0%
have a family group that has more than
 
00:46:15.349 --> 00:46:15.359 align:start position:0%
12. there are many towns currently
 
00:46:16.849 --> 00:46:16.859 align:start position:0%
though that do not allow for that
 
00:46:19.250 --> 00:46:19.260 align:start position:0%
because of zoning so you also have that
 
00:46:21.170 --> 00:46:21.180 align:start position:0%
restriction as well or you have the life
 
00:46:23.809 --> 00:46:23.819 align:start position:0%
safety codes they're not approving them
 
00:46:25.730 --> 00:46:25.740 align:start position:0%
and we have experts in the room who can
 
00:46:28.550 --> 00:46:28.560 align:start position:0%
speak to potentially why but family
 
00:46:30.470 --> 00:46:30.480 align:start position:0%
group right now there are not many that
 
00:46:32.569 --> 00:46:32.579 align:start position:0%
are being approved more than 12 because
 
00:46:34.790 --> 00:46:34.800 align:start position:0%
their towns won't allow it or their life
 
00:46:37.550 --> 00:46:37.560 align:start position:0%
safety code inspector limits them to 12
 
00:46:39.829 --> 00:46:39.839 align:start position:0%
because of the building and what they
 
00:46:41.750 --> 00:46:41.760 align:start position:0%
have in their building to meet the Life
 
00:46:43.309 --> 00:46:43.319 align:start position:0%
Safety Code the Life Safety Code
 
00:46:46.849 --> 00:46:46.859 align:start position:0%
increases once you get to 13 and above
 
00:46:49.309 --> 00:46:49.319 align:start position:0%
so that's
 
00:46:50.990 --> 00:46:51.000 align:start position:0%
my answer to that and I'm happy to
 
00:46:52.910 --> 00:46:52.920 align:start position:0%
answer any additional questions yes
 
00:46:55.849 --> 00:46:55.859 align:start position:0%
representative Warner so how many family
 
00:46:58.730 --> 00:46:58.740 align:start position:0%
group providers do we have family group
 
00:47:02.210 --> 00:47:02.220 align:start position:0%
we currently have 69 69 but we only have
 
00:47:04.430 --> 00:47:04.440 align:start position:0%
all right but to clarify two we only
 
00:47:04.440 --> 00:47:05.690 align:start position:0%
all right but to clarify two we only
have

00:47:05.690 --> 00:47:05.700 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:47:07.430 --> 00:47:07.440 align:start position:0%
um with those that are more than 12 out
 
00:47:10.130 --> 00:47:10.140 align:start position:0%
of that 69 is only 38.
 
00:47:12.770 --> 00:47:12.780 align:start position:0%
for family groups that are carrying more
 
00:47:14.990 --> 00:47:15.000 align:start position:0%
than 12.
 
00:47:18.050 --> 00:47:18.060 align:start position:0%
and a further question yes
 
00:47:18.060 --> 00:47:20.390 align:start position:0%
and a further question yes
um

00:47:20.390 --> 00:47:20.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:24.109 --> 00:47:24.119 align:start position:0%
so what the department intends to do is
 
00:47:26.210 --> 00:47:26.220 align:start position:0%
that if I'm at home and I'm taking care
 
00:47:28.490 --> 00:47:28.500 align:start position:0%
of six children and I have a license for
 
00:47:28.500 --> 00:47:30.109 align:start position:0%
of six children and I have a license for
six

00:47:30.109 --> 00:47:30.119 align:start position:0%
six
 
00:47:32.750 --> 00:47:32.760 align:start position:0%
you're saying that now I can be a family
 
00:47:35.569 --> 00:47:35.579 align:start position:0%
group provider and have a license for
 
00:47:38.750 --> 00:47:38.760 align:start position:0%
knowing aren't there other
 
00:47:41.809 --> 00:47:41.819 align:start position:0%
rules that govern
 
00:47:46.010 --> 00:47:46.020 align:start position:0%
what a family child care provider needs
 
00:47:49.790 --> 00:47:49.800 align:start position:0%
to have in place to be go from 6 to 12.
 
00:47:54.109 --> 00:47:54.119 align:start position:0%
yes so when they are caring for a family
 
00:47:54.119 --> 00:47:55.309 align:start position:0%
yes so when they are caring for a family
group

00:47:55.309 --> 00:47:55.319 align:start position:0%
group
 
00:47:57.470 --> 00:47:57.480 align:start position:0%
when a family group provider is working
 
00:48:00.349 --> 00:48:00.359 align:start position:0%
alone so there's only one provider
 
00:48:02.690 --> 00:48:02.700 align:start position:0%
currently the way the rule reads is that
 
00:48:04.970 --> 00:48:04.980 align:start position:0%
they can care for six preschool children
 
00:48:07.010 --> 00:48:07.020 align:start position:0%
plus three school-aged children and that
 
00:48:09.410 --> 00:48:09.420 align:start position:0%
rule would remain so they would still
 
00:48:12.109 --> 00:48:12.119 align:start position:0%
they'd be licensed as family group
 
00:48:14.270 --> 00:48:14.280 align:start position:0%
as a licenses family group when they're
 
00:48:15.829 --> 00:48:15.839 align:start position:0%
carrying when they only have one
 
00:48:18.530 --> 00:48:18.540 align:start position:0%
provider that rule is still is there now
 
00:48:21.530 --> 00:48:21.540 align:start position:0%
and we intend to keep that
 
00:48:23.329 --> 00:48:23.339 align:start position:0%
so they'll be in compliance with Life
 
00:48:26.150 --> 00:48:26.160 align:start position:0%
Safety Code with the capacity and then
 
00:48:28.250 --> 00:48:28.260 align:start position:0%
also they'll be meeting our rule okay so
 
00:48:32.569 --> 00:48:32.579 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:35.150 --> 00:48:35.160 align:start position:0%
um places for children will be in the
 
00:48:38.770 --> 00:48:38.780 align:start position:0%
family group the 38 or potentially more
 
00:48:40.910 --> 00:48:40.920 align:start position:0%
family group
 
00:48:43.430 --> 00:48:43.440 align:start position:0%
they'll be they'll always now be limited
 
00:48:46.370 --> 00:48:46.380 align:start position:0%
to 12. right yes and and as I mentioned
 
00:48:48.410 --> 00:48:48.420 align:start position:0%
there were I'm not sure how many I could
 
00:48:49.910 --> 00:48:49.920 align:start position:0%
try to see if I could find out how many
 
00:48:52.609 --> 00:48:52.619 align:start position:0%
have come on board recently
 
00:48:54.829 --> 00:48:54.839 align:start position:0%
that have been approved for more than 12
 
00:48:57.410 --> 00:48:57.420 align:start position:0%
because like I said there are many towns
 
00:48:59.329 --> 00:48:59.339 align:start position:0%
or Life Safety go where they're not able
 
00:49:01.309 --> 00:49:01.319 align:start position:0%
to meet that standard anyway so they are
 
00:49:03.490 --> 00:49:03.500 align:start position:0%
being limited to 12 through their local
 
00:49:05.990 --> 00:49:06.000 align:start position:0%
requirements not necessarily through
 
00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:07.010 align:start position:0%
requirements not necessarily through
license

00:49:07.010 --> 00:49:07.020 align:start position:0%
license
 
00:49:09.650 --> 00:49:09.660 align:start position:0%
as well but that could give us some
 
00:49:11.329 --> 00:49:11.339 align:start position:0%
additional Clarity on the issue as well
 
00:49:13.790 --> 00:49:13.800 align:start position:0%
okay thank you you're welcome so to
 
00:49:15.950 --> 00:49:15.960 align:start position:0%
follow up on what representative Wallen
 
00:49:18.349 --> 00:49:18.359 align:start position:0%
are saying in a world in which they
 
00:49:19.790 --> 00:49:19.800 align:start position:0%
could their local rules allowed them to
 
00:49:21.349 --> 00:49:21.359 align:start position:0%
have more than 12. this this would
 
00:49:23.089 --> 00:49:23.099 align:start position:0%
basically prohibit that
 
00:49:25.370 --> 00:49:25.380 align:start position:0%
yes and it has to do with the Life
 
00:49:26.510 --> 00:49:26.520 align:start position:0%
Safety Code
 
00:49:28.190 --> 00:49:28.200 align:start position:0%
as well so
 
00:49:28.200 --> 00:49:29.870 align:start position:0%
as well so
um

00:49:29.870 --> 00:49:29.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:49:31.609 --> 00:49:31.619 align:start position:0%
somebody from the Fire Marshal's office
 
00:49:34.190 --> 00:49:34.200 align:start position:0%
here okay well yes um we'll let you
 
00:49:35.809 --> 00:49:35.819 align:start position:0%
finish up Miss Clement before we do that
 
00:49:37.130 --> 00:49:37.140 align:start position:0%
but I think you guys aren't signed up to
 
00:49:38.690 --> 00:49:38.700 align:start position:0%
speak but I would like you to come up
 
00:49:39.770 --> 00:49:39.780 align:start position:0%
and I think answer some of these
 
00:49:39.780 --> 00:49:41.210 align:start position:0%
and I think answer some of these
questions

00:49:41.210 --> 00:49:41.220 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:49:45.890 --> 00:49:45.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:47.809 --> 00:49:47.819 align:start position:0%
representative McWilliams
 
00:49:48.890 --> 00:49:48.900 align:start position:0%
I know you've already had a whole bunch
 
00:49:48.900 --> 00:49:52.550 align:start position:0%
I know you've already had a whole bunch
of

00:49:52.550 --> 00:49:52.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:55.430 --> 00:49:55.440 align:start position:0%
bunch of disgusting and gotten in your
 
00:49:58.609 --> 00:49:58.619 align:start position:0%
heads so this this 12 number and I know
 
00:50:00.470 --> 00:50:00.480 align:start position:0%
the Fire Marshal's Office will speak a
 
00:50:02.630 --> 00:50:02.640 align:start position:0%
little bit more to it there's a
 
00:50:04.910 --> 00:50:04.920 align:start position:0%
potential for maybe 38 of these
 
00:50:06.950 --> 00:50:06.960 align:start position:0%
facilities who could have had more than
 
00:50:10.309 --> 00:50:10.319 align:start position:0%
12 that will now be locked to 12. is
 
00:50:12.349 --> 00:50:12.359 align:start position:0%
there a potential for exemption no so
 
00:50:13.970 --> 00:50:13.980 align:start position:0%
there's a grandfather clause in this
 
00:50:15.890 --> 00:50:15.900 align:start position:0%
amendment yes so anyone who's currently
 
00:50:18.410 --> 00:50:18.420 align:start position:0%
licensed under it's
 
00:50:23.510 --> 00:50:23.520 align:start position:0%
on page one on line 26 applicability the
 
00:50:25.010 --> 00:50:25.020 align:start position:0%
provisions of the Zac shall apply to
 
00:50:26.510 --> 00:50:26.520 align:start position:0%
programs licensed on or after the
 
00:50:27.829 --> 00:50:27.839 align:start position:0%
effective date
 
00:50:29.630 --> 00:50:29.640 align:start position:0%
so it's moving forward those who are
 
00:50:31.250 --> 00:50:31.260 align:start position:0%
currently licensed will keep that
 
00:50:33.410 --> 00:50:33.420 align:start position:0%
license and remain licensed the way they
 
00:50:33.420 --> 00:50:35.030 align:start position:0%
license and remain licensed the way they
are

00:50:35.030 --> 00:50:35.040 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:50:37.670 --> 00:50:37.680 align:start position:0%
but for a new facility that could
 
00:50:39.589 --> 00:50:39.599 align:start position:0%
potentially fall into what's currently
 
00:50:42.230 --> 00:50:42.240 align:start position:0%
happening with those 38 or so they
 
00:50:44.390 --> 00:50:44.400 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be able to go past 12 after the
 
00:50:47.630 --> 00:50:47.640 align:start position:0%
date of this is an act yes correct all
 
00:50:49.370 --> 00:50:49.380 align:start position:0%
right thank you you're welcome
 
00:50:52.730 --> 00:50:52.740 align:start position:0%
for the questions from the committee
 
00:50:55.370 --> 00:50:55.380 align:start position:0%
thank you and I'm just coming you're
 
00:50:57.290 --> 00:50:57.300 align:start position:0%
hanging around right I assume yes we may
 
00:50:59.410 --> 00:50:59.420 align:start position:0%
I get the feeling you may be coming back
 
00:51:02.569 --> 00:51:02.579 align:start position:0%
I'm here for the duration yes
 
00:51:05.270 --> 00:51:05.280 align:start position:0%
um I don't have any we do we do we're
 
00:51:06.410 --> 00:51:06.420 align:start position:0%
not having else time to speak I would
 
00:51:08.089 --> 00:51:08.099 align:start position:0%
like the Fire Marshal's Office to come
 
00:51:09.470 --> 00:51:09.480 align:start position:0%
forward I think there are some questions
 
00:51:11.030 --> 00:51:11.040 align:start position:0%
we'd like to hear from you guys is that
 
00:51:12.410 --> 00:51:12.420 align:start position:0%
the sentiment of committee when they
 
00:51:13.849 --> 00:51:13.859 align:start position:0%
haven't fill out the card I think I
 
00:51:15.170 --> 00:51:15.180 align:start position:0%
think we'd like we'd like that if we
 
00:51:15.180 --> 00:51:21.109 align:start position:0%
think we'd like we'd like that if we
could

00:51:21.109 --> 00:51:21.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:22.609 --> 00:51:22.619 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
00:51:24.770 --> 00:51:24.780 align:start position:0%
two chair thing I'm Sean to Mary I'm the
 
00:51:25.849 --> 00:51:25.859 align:start position:0%
State Farm Marshall I'm going to let
 
00:51:27.349 --> 00:51:27.359 align:start position:0%
Deputy Mitch Katie speak a little bit
 
00:51:29.030 --> 00:51:29.040 align:start position:0%
he's been integrally involved in the
 
00:51:30.589 --> 00:51:30.599 align:start position:0%
subcommittee work
 
00:51:32.450 --> 00:51:32.460 align:start position:0%
um so I can back him up but I just let
 
00:51:33.710 --> 00:51:33.720 align:start position:0%
him where he's been more involved I'll
 
00:51:36.230 --> 00:51:36.240 align:start position:0%
let him talk to that so we are very
 
00:51:38.270 --> 00:51:38.280 align:start position:0%
supportive of this process and the
 
00:51:40.849 --> 00:51:40.859 align:start position:0%
Village today but I'll let him to the
 
00:51:42.349 --> 00:51:42.359 align:start position:0%
questions good morning Mr chairman
 
00:51:44.390 --> 00:51:44.400 align:start position:0%
members of the committee uh like the
 
00:51:46.190 --> 00:51:46.200 align:start position:0%
Marshall said my name is Mitch Katie the
 
00:51:48.049 --> 00:51:48.059 align:start position:0%
deputy State Fire Marshal I oversee the
 
00:51:49.490 --> 00:51:49.500 align:start position:0%
building safety and Construction Group
 
00:51:52.069 --> 00:51:52.079 align:start position:0%
for the Marshal's office and we've been
 
00:51:54.349 --> 00:51:54.359 align:start position:0%
working very closely with Jen and her
 
00:51:56.230 --> 00:51:56.240 align:start position:0%
working group on
 
00:51:58.250 --> 00:51:58.260 align:start position:0%
aligning some of these discussions that
 
00:51:59.690 --> 00:51:59.700 align:start position:0%
we've been having to kind of clean up
 
00:52:02.690 --> 00:52:02.700 align:start position:0%
some of the discrepancies in DHHS rule
 
00:52:05.630 --> 00:52:05.640 align:start position:0%
as they relate to the state fire code to
 
00:52:07.130 --> 00:52:07.140 align:start position:0%
answer your question there's
 
00:52:10.309 --> 00:52:10.319 align:start position:0%
um the state adopts the 2018 edition of
 
00:52:11.569 --> 00:52:11.579 align:start position:0%
The Life Safety Code which is
 
00:52:14.210 --> 00:52:14.220 align:start position:0%
enforceable uh across the state and
 
00:52:16.630 --> 00:52:16.640 align:start position:0%
within that document there's rules
 
00:52:19.849 --> 00:52:19.859 align:start position:0%
relative to daycare occupancies and
 
00:52:21.650 --> 00:52:21.660 align:start position:0%
within those daycare occupancies on the
 
00:52:24.370 --> 00:52:24.380 align:start position:0%
Life Safety Code there's numbers of
 
00:52:27.530 --> 00:52:27.540 align:start position:0%
occupants that are set based upon that
 
00:52:29.750 --> 00:52:29.760 align:start position:0%
code so when we start talking about no
 
00:52:31.210 --> 00:52:31.220 align:start position:0%
more than 12
 
00:52:33.890 --> 00:52:33.900 align:start position:0%
those those numbers come out of the
 
00:52:36.230 --> 00:52:36.240 align:start position:0%
state fire code as it sits so if you
 
00:52:38.690 --> 00:52:38.700 align:start position:0%
were to go to uh commuting and open up a
 
00:52:41.569 --> 00:52:41.579 align:start position:0%
new daycare and you wanted to have 15 to
 
00:52:43.670 --> 00:52:43.680 align:start position:0%
20 kids per se you'd have to follow
 
00:52:45.829 --> 00:52:45.839 align:start position:0%
different requirements under the state
 
00:52:48.230 --> 00:52:48.240 align:start position:0%
fire code than you would if you only
 
00:52:50.390 --> 00:52:50.400 align:start position:0%
wanted to have six kids or five kids or
 
00:52:52.549 --> 00:52:52.559 align:start position:0%
whatever that number may be so 12 is
 
00:52:54.170 --> 00:52:54.180 align:start position:0%
kind of that magic threshold that we
 
00:52:57.170 --> 00:52:57.180 align:start position:0%
look at under the fire code for where
 
00:52:59.450 --> 00:52:59.460 align:start position:0%
different requirements fall so again
 
00:53:02.089 --> 00:53:02.099 align:start position:0%
depending on the number of children that
 
00:53:03.349 --> 00:53:03.359 align:start position:0%
are going to be
 
00:53:06.410 --> 00:53:06.420 align:start position:0%
occupying this daycare determines the no
 
00:53:08.990 --> 00:53:09.000 align:start position:0%
the the level of protection relative to
 
00:53:10.430 --> 00:53:10.440 align:start position:0%
building construction fire protection
 
00:53:12.470 --> 00:53:12.480 align:start position:0%
features and so on that would need to be
 
00:53:15.109 --> 00:53:15.119 align:start position:0%
present in that area if you will because
 
00:53:16.910 --> 00:53:16.920 align:start position:0%
again the point of this bill is to get
 
00:53:19.910 --> 00:53:19.920 align:start position:0%
these smaller daycares out of the home
 
00:53:21.890 --> 00:53:21.900 align:start position:0%
environment into a more commercial
 
00:53:24.170 --> 00:53:24.180 align:start position:0%
setting if you will which the fire code
 
00:53:26.750 --> 00:53:26.760 align:start position:0%
allows under the definition of
 
00:53:29.569 --> 00:53:29.579 align:start position:0%
um these day cares it's generally within
 
00:53:30.950 --> 00:53:30.960 align:start position:0%
a dwelling unit for some of these
 
00:53:33.470 --> 00:53:33.480 align:start position:0%
smaller uh daycares however part of the
 
00:53:35.510 --> 00:53:35.520 align:start position:0%
the point of this working group has been
 
00:53:38.030 --> 00:53:38.040 align:start position:0%
to expand that
 
00:53:41.030 --> 00:53:41.040 align:start position:0%
ability to open up some of these smaller
 
00:53:43.549 --> 00:53:43.559 align:start position:0%
daycares of less than 12 in some of your
 
00:53:47.750 --> 00:53:47.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:49.370 --> 00:53:49.380 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee I certainly
 
00:53:53.089 --> 00:53:53.099 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:54.589 --> 00:53:54.599 align:start position:0%
um okay I'll start off
 
00:53:54.599 --> 00:53:55.430 align:start position:0%
um okay I'll start off
um

00:53:55.430 --> 00:53:55.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:53:57.170 --> 00:53:57.180 align:start position:0%
so I think just kind of looking around I
 
00:53:58.450 --> 00:53:58.460 align:start position:0%
think there is some
 
00:54:01.130 --> 00:54:01.140 align:start position:0%
heartburn that the idea of that we would
 
00:54:02.450 --> 00:54:02.460 align:start position:0%
be grandfathering in some and then
 
00:54:04.549 --> 00:54:04.559 align:start position:0%
disallowing futures
 
00:54:06.349 --> 00:54:06.359 align:start position:0%
um so I guess kind of get to the
 
00:54:08.870 --> 00:54:08.880 align:start position:0%
philosophical question here which is if
 
00:54:11.930 --> 00:54:11.940 align:start position:0%
it's not safe to have more than 12 why
 
00:54:13.849 --> 00:54:13.859 align:start position:0%
are we grandfathering it
 
00:54:16.069 --> 00:54:16.079 align:start position:0%
um and if that is the case right I mean
 
00:54:17.210 --> 00:54:17.220 align:start position:0%
that's a legitimate question if it's not
 
00:54:18.710 --> 00:54:18.720 align:start position:0%
safe why we're doing it
 
00:54:20.750 --> 00:54:20.760 align:start position:0%
um and then if the I guess the follow-up
 
00:54:22.910 --> 00:54:22.920 align:start position:0%
to that would be couldn't we write in
 
00:54:24.290 --> 00:54:24.300 align:start position:0%
something into this bill I didn't really
 
00:54:27.410 --> 00:54:27.420 align:start position:0%
want to amend this bill but if if we do
 
00:54:28.970 --> 00:54:28.980 align:start position:0%
amend it could we write something in to
 
00:54:31.549 --> 00:54:31.559 align:start position:0%
where you know over 12 when it allow
 
00:54:33.589 --> 00:54:33.599 align:start position:0%
when when allowed when it meets the
 
00:54:35.750 --> 00:54:35.760 align:start position:0%
standards of the fire cup
 
00:54:37.190 --> 00:54:37.200 align:start position:0%
could we put something in there to kill
 
00:54:37.970 --> 00:54:37.980 align:start position:0%
that because I think there's some
 
00:54:39.829 --> 00:54:39.839 align:start position:0%
concern about that 12 number
 
00:54:42.770 --> 00:54:42.780 align:start position:0%
so just uh representative the the way
 
00:54:45.049 --> 00:54:45.059 align:start position:0%
the fire code is written it breaks down
 
00:54:45.059 --> 00:54:46.970 align:start position:0%
the fire code is written it breaks down
the

00:54:46.970 --> 00:54:46.980 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:54:49.910 --> 00:54:49.920 align:start position:0%
the daycares into a new daycare so to
 
00:54:51.049 --> 00:54:51.059 align:start position:0%
say you were going to build a brand new
 
00:54:53.510 --> 00:54:53.520 align:start position:0%
daycare at your home your residence and
 
00:54:55.490 --> 00:54:55.500 align:start position:0%
you wanted to build today you'd have to
 
00:54:57.109 --> 00:54:57.119 align:start position:0%
meet a certain set of standards that are
 
00:54:59.990 --> 00:55:00.000 align:start position:0%
established under the state fire code
 
00:55:01.670 --> 00:55:01.680 align:start position:0%
on the flip side of that there is
 
00:55:03.650 --> 00:55:03.660 align:start position:0%
Provisions for what they call existing
 
00:55:06.109 --> 00:55:06.119 align:start position:0%
daycares that have been in existence
 
00:55:07.390 --> 00:55:07.400 align:start position:0%
they've been up they've been operating
 
00:55:11.150 --> 00:55:11.160 align:start position:0%
and you know we would articulate that if
 
00:55:13.730 --> 00:55:13.740 align:start position:0%
there's more than 12 children in this
 
00:55:15.349 --> 00:55:15.359 align:start position:0%
daycare that they would have to meet the
 
00:55:16.790 --> 00:55:16.800 align:start position:0%
requirements under the state fire code
 
00:55:18.950 --> 00:55:18.960 align:start position:0%
for that occupancy
 
00:55:20.990 --> 00:55:21.000 align:start position:0%
um so as far as the fire code goes the
 
00:55:23.390 --> 00:55:23.400 align:start position:0%
fire code makes Provisions for a new
 
00:55:25.549 --> 00:55:25.559 align:start position:0%
daycare and an existing daycare again
 
00:55:28.309 --> 00:55:28.319 align:start position:0%
that number is the number of occupants
 
00:55:30.530 --> 00:55:30.540 align:start position:0%
is where they would have to fall in
 
00:55:32.270 --> 00:55:32.280 align:start position:0%
terms of what those requirements would
 
00:55:36.049 --> 00:55:36.059 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:38.390 --> 00:55:38.400 align:start position:0%
representatively Simoni
 
00:55:40.190 --> 00:55:40.200 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
00:55:44.809 --> 00:55:44.819 align:start position:0%
taking my question so the 2018 Life
 
00:55:48.049 --> 00:55:48.059 align:start position:0%
Safety Code currently says
 
00:55:50.809 --> 00:55:50.819 align:start position:0%
that over 12
 
00:55:54.049 --> 00:55:54.059 align:start position:0%
is unsafe
 
00:55:56.230 --> 00:55:56.240 align:start position:0%
can you can you explain what the 2018
 
00:56:00.950 --> 00:56:00.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:02.750 --> 00:56:02.760 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
00:56:06.290 --> 00:56:06.300 align:start position:0%
um so there the the threshold of 12 is
 
00:56:08.450 --> 00:56:08.460 align:start position:0%
the where
 
00:56:11.150 --> 00:56:11.160 align:start position:0%
you look at applying different safety
 
00:56:14.450 --> 00:56:14.460 align:start position:0%
features to those occupancies so if
 
00:56:16.490 --> 00:56:16.500 align:start position:0%
there's a if there's a daycare currently
 
00:56:18.530 --> 00:56:18.540 align:start position:0%
that's operating with I'll use an
 
00:56:22.130 --> 00:56:22.140 align:start position:0%
arbitrary number of 18. with 18 children
 
00:56:25.730 --> 00:56:25.740 align:start position:0%
That Daycare in theory should be meeting
 
00:56:27.470 --> 00:56:27.480 align:start position:0%
the requirements of the Life Safety Code
 
00:56:30.049 --> 00:56:30.059 align:start position:0%
for a daycare occupancy that has more
 
00:56:34.069 --> 00:56:34.079 align:start position:0%
than 12 kids 12 12 children so the the
 
00:56:37.069 --> 00:56:37.079 align:start position:0%
rules we're not necessarily saying one's
 
00:56:38.990 --> 00:56:39.000 align:start position:0%
more safe or less safe what we're saying
 
00:56:42.470 --> 00:56:42.480 align:start position:0%
is that there's the the numbers dictate
 
00:56:44.390 --> 00:56:44.400 align:start position:0%
what level of protection that the fire
 
00:56:46.010 --> 00:56:46.020 align:start position:0%
code requires
 
00:56:47.750 --> 00:56:47.760 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:56:49.490 --> 00:56:49.500 align:start position:0%
just follow
 
00:56:52.130 --> 00:56:52.140 align:start position:0%
thank you I I'm just trying to wrap my
 
00:56:53.630 --> 00:56:53.640 align:start position:0%
head around this to make sure that the
 
00:56:56.329 --> 00:56:56.339 align:start position:0%
kids are safe so
 
00:56:59.510 --> 00:56:59.520 align:start position:0%
if the new code requirements have to be
 
00:57:02.329 --> 00:57:02.339 align:start position:0%
met by new
 
00:57:04.670 --> 00:57:04.680 align:start position:0%
child care facilities
 
00:57:08.270 --> 00:57:08.280 align:start position:0%
why is it that the existing Child Care
 
00:57:11.990 --> 00:57:12.000 align:start position:0%
Facilities aren't required to come up to
 
00:57:15.109 --> 00:57:15.119 align:start position:0%
those standards upon renewal of
 
00:57:15.119 --> 00:57:16.990 align:start position:0%
those standards upon renewal of
licensure

00:57:16.990 --> 00:57:17.000 align:start position:0%
licensure
 
00:57:19.790 --> 00:57:19.800 align:start position:0%
there's the way that the codes are
 
00:57:22.930 --> 00:57:22.940 align:start position:0%
written is that they take account for
 
00:57:26.049 --> 00:57:26.059 align:start position:0%
upgrades and safety features upgrades in
 
00:57:29.150 --> 00:57:29.160 align:start position:0%
technology and so on so forth It's
 
00:57:31.130 --> 00:57:31.140 align:start position:0%
understanding that
 
00:57:33.290 --> 00:57:33.300 align:start position:0%
sometimes it becomes
 
00:57:35.870 --> 00:57:35.880 align:start position:0%
is a balance between practicality and
 
00:57:38.510 --> 00:57:38.520 align:start position:0%
Effectiveness so that when
 
00:57:40.010 --> 00:57:40.020 align:start position:0%
you go and you say you're going to
 
00:57:42.170 --> 00:57:42.180 align:start position:0%
upgrade your license the way the fire
 
00:57:44.329 --> 00:57:44.339 align:start position:0%
code is designed we wouldn't mandate
 
00:57:46.430 --> 00:57:46.440 align:start position:0%
that they get brought up to those new
 
00:57:48.650 --> 00:57:48.660 align:start position:0%
new construction standards if you will
 
00:57:51.710 --> 00:57:51.720 align:start position:0%
only just by nature of re-licensing and
 
00:57:53.930 --> 00:57:53.940 align:start position:0%
so on though the way the consensus
 
00:57:55.490 --> 00:57:55.500 align:start position:0%
documents are written or the codes are
 
00:57:57.589 --> 00:57:57.599 align:start position:0%
written is that they've been established
 
00:58:01.190 --> 00:58:01.200 align:start position:0%
to take into account that some of the
 
00:58:03.230 --> 00:58:03.240 align:start position:0%
building features
 
00:58:05.870 --> 00:58:05.880 align:start position:0%
may not be perfect but they're still
 
00:58:07.910 --> 00:58:07.920 align:start position:0%
safe under the guise of the code and
 
00:58:09.890 --> 00:58:09.900 align:start position:0%
that they're still safe under as we've
 
00:58:12.470 --> 00:58:12.480 align:start position:0%
adopted it here under state law and you
 
00:58:14.930 --> 00:58:14.940 align:start position:0%
know as the state fire code so that it's
 
00:58:17.450 --> 00:58:17.460 align:start position:0%
not a I don't want to call it a
 
00:58:18.890 --> 00:58:18.900 align:start position:0%
diminished level of safety because
 
00:58:20.390 --> 00:58:20.400 align:start position:0%
there's a there's an established level
 
00:58:23.150 --> 00:58:23.160 align:start position:0%
of safety for these existing daycares if
 
00:58:24.950 --> 00:58:24.960 align:start position:0%
these daycares have been inspected
 
00:58:27.410 --> 00:58:27.420 align:start position:0%
they've been re-licensed every you know
 
00:58:29.210 --> 00:58:29.220 align:start position:0%
on their their light re-licensing
 
00:58:31.490 --> 00:58:31.500 align:start position:0%
schedule you know part of that process
 
00:58:33.470 --> 00:58:33.480 align:start position:0%
is to have the fire department or the
 
00:58:34.849 --> 00:58:34.859 align:start position:0%
the building inspector the fire
 
00:58:36.710 --> 00:58:36.720 align:start position:0%
inspector whoever's in charge in that
 
00:58:40.270 --> 00:58:40.280 align:start position:0%
Community go out establish what's there
 
00:58:42.589 --> 00:58:42.599 align:start position:0%
compare it to what the state fire code
 
00:58:45.829 --> 00:58:45.839 align:start position:0%
says that is that we've established as a
 
00:58:47.390 --> 00:58:47.400 align:start position:0%
safe level of
 
00:58:47.400 --> 00:58:48.589 align:start position:0%
safe level of
um

00:58:48.589 --> 00:58:48.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:58:51.349 --> 00:58:51.359 align:start position:0%
uh building features that are provided
 
00:58:53.390 --> 00:58:53.400 align:start position:0%
to make sure that that building is code
 
00:58:55.849 --> 00:58:55.859 align:start position:0%
compliant for that use to make sure that
 
00:58:57.470 --> 00:58:57.480 align:start position:0%
the kids are safe
 
00:59:00.410 --> 00:59:00.420 align:start position:0%
does that make sense thank you
 
00:59:02.510 --> 00:59:02.520 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee
 
00:59:05.450 --> 00:59:05.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:08.510 --> 00:59:08.520 align:start position:0%
full disclosure I'm an architect
 
00:59:10.789 --> 00:59:10.799 align:start position:0%
so let's talk about some of the like
 
00:59:12.589 --> 00:59:12.599 align:start position:0%
must-have safety features right so when
 
00:59:14.150 --> 00:59:14.160 align:start position:0%
we're talking about 12 being the cut off
 
00:59:16.730 --> 00:59:16.740 align:start position:0%
okay if we have like a basement of a
 
00:59:17.990 --> 00:59:18.000 align:start position:0%
raised Ranch where we're putting
 
00:59:20.210 --> 00:59:20.220 align:start position:0%
children and they're a home daycare but
 
00:59:22.250 --> 00:59:22.260 align:start position:0%
maybe they want to take more than 12. I
 
00:59:23.450 --> 00:59:23.460 align:start position:0%
understand you're going to probably need
 
00:59:25.910 --> 00:59:25.920 align:start position:0%
two means of egress right to make sure
 
00:59:26.990 --> 00:59:27.000 align:start position:0%
that everybody can get out if there's a
 
00:59:28.370 --> 00:59:28.380 align:start position:0%
fire in one corner of the basement they
 
00:59:30.289 --> 00:59:30.299 align:start position:0%
can get out two different Corners two
 
00:59:31.970 --> 00:59:31.980 align:start position:0%
different directions it's a life safety
 
00:59:33.410 --> 00:59:33.420 align:start position:0%
thing and I totally get that and that
 
00:59:35.450 --> 00:59:35.460 align:start position:0%
makes sense right but some of these
 
00:59:37.190 --> 00:59:37.200 align:start position:0%
other requirements may not completely
 
00:59:40.130 --> 00:59:40.140 align:start position:0%
make sense for an existing facility to
 
00:59:41.569 --> 00:59:41.579 align:start position:0%
make them upgrade and add a second means
 
00:59:43.370 --> 00:59:43.380 align:start position:0%
of egress as the code gets stricter and
 
00:59:45.589 --> 00:59:45.599 align:start position:0%
stricter and I know this is also based
 
00:59:47.450 --> 00:59:47.460 align:start position:0%
on occupancy for the square footage of
 
00:59:49.490 --> 00:59:49.500 align:start position:0%
the space provided right so if we have a
 
00:59:50.990 --> 00:59:51.000 align:start position:0%
larger space you can probably have more
 
00:59:52.490 --> 00:59:52.500 align:start position:0%
kids if you have a smaller footprint
 
00:59:54.289 --> 00:59:54.299 align:start position:0%
then you're just limited for occupancy
 
00:59:56.150 --> 00:59:56.160 align:start position:0%
for the number of kids allowed within
 
00:59:58.309 --> 00:59:58.319 align:start position:0%
that basement facility right correct
 
01:00:00.289 --> 01:00:00.299 align:start position:0%
we're on the same page on this okay so I
 
01:00:01.789 --> 01:00:01.799 align:start position:0%
think the the fairness piece that we're
 
01:00:04.130 --> 01:00:04.140 align:start position:0%
grappling with is a committee is that if
 
01:00:05.630 --> 01:00:05.640 align:start position:0%
we're going to grandfather under
 
01:00:07.910 --> 01:00:07.920 align:start position:0%
previous codes some of these facilities
 
01:00:09.650 --> 01:00:09.660 align:start position:0%
but we're not going to allow new
 
01:00:11.569 --> 01:00:11.579 align:start position:0%
facilities to meet those requirements
 
01:00:13.430 --> 01:00:13.440 align:start position:0%
then it seems like there are some things
 
01:00:14.990 --> 01:00:15.000 align:start position:0%
that are squishy that can be allowable
 
01:00:16.609 --> 01:00:16.619 align:start position:0%
to get through
 
01:00:18.710 --> 01:00:18.720 align:start position:0%
right that are not necessarily two means
 
01:00:20.089 --> 01:00:20.099 align:start position:0%
of egress because that's an egregious
 
01:00:22.430 --> 01:00:22.440 align:start position:0%
thing but something that's a little bit
 
01:00:27.470 --> 01:00:27.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:29.750 --> 01:00:29.760 align:start position:0%
and thank you for the question and I I
 
01:00:31.670 --> 01:00:31.680 align:start position:0%
want to make sure we answer it so just
 
01:00:34.789 --> 01:00:34.799 align:start position:0%
if any time you know your two means of
 
01:00:36.650 --> 01:00:36.660 align:start position:0%
egress you know you you have a basement
 
01:00:38.630 --> 01:00:38.640 align:start position:0%
of a ranch a raised Ranch if you will
 
01:00:40.910 --> 01:00:40.920 align:start position:0%
you know that those the sleeping rooms
 
01:00:42.589 --> 01:00:42.599 align:start position:0%
would require a primary mean to be
 
01:00:44.150 --> 01:00:44.160 align:start position:0%
aggressive secondary means of Escape if
 
01:00:45.410 --> 01:00:45.420 align:start position:0%
there's no sprinkler system in the
 
01:00:47.089 --> 01:00:47.099 align:start position:0%
building so on so forth there's a number
 
01:00:49.010 --> 01:00:49.020 align:start position:0%
of a host of requirements that would be
 
01:00:51.470 --> 01:00:51.480 align:start position:0%
put into place the thought process being
 
01:00:53.950 --> 01:00:53.960 align:start position:0%
and and
 
01:00:57.170 --> 01:00:57.180 align:start position:0%
understanding that if these existing
 
01:00:59.030 --> 01:00:59.040 align:start position:0%
buildings let's say again they were
 
01:01:01.970 --> 01:01:01.980 align:start position:0%
licensed for 20 15 to 20 kids whatever
 
01:01:03.890 --> 01:01:03.900 align:start position:0%
that number may be more than 12. the
 
01:01:05.210 --> 01:01:05.220 align:start position:0%
fire department should have been
 
01:01:07.370 --> 01:01:07.380 align:start position:0%
inspecting that building to the
 
01:01:09.470 --> 01:01:09.480 align:start position:0%
appropriate occupancy chapter or the
 
01:01:11.030 --> 01:01:11.040 align:start position:0%
appropriate occupancy section of the
 
01:01:13.250 --> 01:01:13.260 align:start position:0%
daycare chapter to begin with because
 
01:01:16.730 --> 01:01:16.740 align:start position:0%
the fire code doesn't dictate licensing
 
01:01:19.190 --> 01:01:19.200 align:start position:0%
so when the fire inspector or the
 
01:01:20.329 --> 01:01:20.339 align:start position:0%
building inspector whoever that
 
01:01:22.609 --> 01:01:22.619 align:start position:0%
Authority having jurisdiction is went
 
01:01:25.069 --> 01:01:25.079 align:start position:0%
out however many years ago to look at
 
01:01:27.170 --> 01:01:27.180 align:start position:0%
this space and say we want to put 15
 
01:01:29.630 --> 01:01:29.640 align:start position:0%
children in this area they should have
 
01:01:31.250 --> 01:01:31.260 align:start position:0%
been looking at it under the
 
01:01:32.510 --> 01:01:32.520 align:start position:0%
prescriptive guise of the state fire
 
01:01:34.130 --> 01:01:34.140 align:start position:0%
code to make sure that those
 
01:01:36.950 --> 01:01:36.960 align:start position:0%
requirements were put into place
 
01:01:40.490 --> 01:01:40.500 align:start position:0%
at the time of the original application
 
01:01:42.650 --> 01:01:42.660 align:start position:0%
and then again those things those
 
01:01:44.690 --> 01:01:44.700 align:start position:0%
inspections have continued during the
 
01:01:46.970 --> 01:01:46.980 align:start position:0%
license renewal process to ensure that
 
01:01:49.069 --> 01:01:49.079 align:start position:0%
any safeguards that would have been had
 
01:01:51.109 --> 01:01:51.119 align:start position:0%
to have been adjusted or manipulated or
 
01:01:53.990 --> 01:01:54.000 align:start position:0%
done so as part of the re-licensing
 
01:01:58.190 --> 01:01:58.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:00.530 --> 01:02:00.540 align:start position:0%
yes of course so just so I understand
 
01:02:02.329 --> 01:02:02.339 align:start position:0%
so it sounds like there really aren't
 
01:02:03.890 --> 01:02:03.900 align:start position:0%
things that are acceptable as
 
01:02:05.270 --> 01:02:05.280 align:start position:0%
grandfathered but these annual
 
01:02:07.250 --> 01:02:07.260 align:start position:0%
inspections you are keeping up with the
 
01:02:09.770 --> 01:02:09.780 align:start position:0%
current fire code right so you're
 
01:02:11.990 --> 01:02:12.000 align:start position:0%
following 2018 even if it was licensed
 
01:02:13.670 --> 01:02:13.680 align:start position:0%
10 years ago and things that may have
 
01:02:15.049 --> 01:02:15.059 align:start position:0%
changed you're still going to check
 
01:02:17.470 --> 01:02:17.480 align:start position:0%
those changes and there may be some
 
01:02:19.549 --> 01:02:19.559 align:start position:0%
modifications required to the facility
 
01:02:22.130 --> 01:02:22.140 align:start position:0%
to keep up with the new codes but we're
 
01:02:24.170 --> 01:02:24.180 align:start position:0%
still going to allow those say 15 or 18
 
01:02:26.030 --> 01:02:26.040 align:start position:0%
kids instead of 12 for the facility
 
01:02:28.069 --> 01:02:28.079 align:start position:0%
that's been operating and successfully
 
01:02:30.470 --> 01:02:30.480 align:start position:0%
having that number of children as long
 
01:02:31.910 --> 01:02:31.920 align:start position:0%
as they've successfully passed their
 
01:02:33.049 --> 01:02:33.059 align:start position:0%
inspections their subsequent
 
01:02:36.349 --> 01:02:36.359 align:start position:0%
instructions and and those you know I
 
01:02:36.359 --> 01:02:38.150 align:start position:0%
instructions and and those you know I
don't

01:02:38.150 --> 01:02:38.160 align:start position:0%
don't
 
01:02:38.160 --> 01:02:39.710 align:start position:0%
don't
those

01:02:39.710 --> 01:02:39.720 align:start position:0%
those
 
01:02:42.109 --> 01:02:42.119 align:start position:0%
changes that have been made from code
 
01:02:44.630 --> 01:02:44.640 align:start position:0%
cycle to code cycle to code cycle
 
01:02:47.270 --> 01:02:47.280 align:start position:0%
under the existing use
 
01:02:47.280 --> 01:02:48.650 align:start position:0%
under the existing use
are

01:02:48.650 --> 01:02:48.660 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:02:50.990 --> 01:02:51.000 align:start position:0%
again I don't have the exact changes in
 
01:02:53.329 --> 01:02:53.339 align:start position:0%
front of me but they tend to be minimal
 
01:02:56.089 --> 01:02:56.099 align:start position:0%
in that sense that you know one year you
 
01:02:56.099 --> 01:02:57.049 align:start position:0%
in that sense that you know one year you
have

01:02:57.049 --> 01:02:57.059 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:02:59.750 --> 01:02:59.760 align:start position:0%
an established daycare and then three
 
01:03:01.910 --> 01:03:01.920 align:start position:0%
years later the fire department makes
 
01:03:03.829 --> 01:03:03.839 align:start position:0%
you put a sprinkler system in those
 
01:03:06.289 --> 01:03:06.299 align:start position:0%
those kind of changes don't occur from
 
01:03:07.910 --> 01:03:07.920 align:start position:0%
code Edition to code Edition in the
 
01:03:11.089 --> 01:03:11.099 align:start position:0%
existing section of the code unless
 
01:03:13.069 --> 01:03:13.079 align:start position:0%
those will all get vetted out through
 
01:03:14.809 --> 01:03:14.819 align:start position:0%
the board of Fire Control through the
 
01:03:16.430 --> 01:03:16.440 align:start position:0%
legislative process upon adoption of the
 
01:03:18.470 --> 01:03:18.480 align:start position:0%
state fire code itself so in these
 
01:03:19.910 --> 01:03:19.920 align:start position:0%
particular in these particular cases
 
01:03:21.470 --> 01:03:21.480 align:start position:0%
again if you have a daycare that's been
 
01:03:24.530 --> 01:03:24.540 align:start position:0%
in operation since the mid-2000s
 
01:03:27.770 --> 01:03:27.780 align:start position:0%
as the code changes those inspections
 
01:03:30.170 --> 01:03:30.180 align:start position:0%
have been done to those changes and any
 
01:03:31.910 --> 01:03:31.920 align:start position:0%
updates to that facility that would have
 
01:03:34.069 --> 01:03:34.079 align:start position:0%
had to have been done however small they
 
01:03:36.650 --> 01:03:36.660 align:start position:0%
may be would in theory have been done
 
01:03:38.870 --> 01:03:38.880 align:start position:0%
along the way so that when we get to
 
01:03:40.670 --> 01:03:40.680 align:start position:0%
this discussion that now that we're
 
01:03:41.870 --> 01:03:41.880 align:start position:0%
looking at
 
01:03:43.370 --> 01:03:43.380 align:start position:0%
again there's not necessarily A
 
01:03:44.990 --> 01:03:45.000 align:start position:0%
grandfathering as far as the fire code
 
01:03:46.370 --> 01:03:46.380 align:start position:0%
is concerned they have to meet the
 
01:03:48.170 --> 01:03:48.180 align:start position:0%
existing requirements of That Daycare
 
01:03:50.630 --> 01:03:50.640 align:start position:0%
chapter and in theory those should have
 
01:03:53.569 --> 01:03:53.579 align:start position:0%
been caught any changes to that should
 
01:03:55.490 --> 01:03:55.500 align:start position:0%
have been caught along the way during
 
01:03:57.349 --> 01:03:57.359 align:start position:0%
the subsequent re-licensing inspections
 
01:03:59.990 --> 01:04:00.000 align:start position:0%
by the fire department but just a second
 
01:04:01.549 --> 01:04:01.559 align:start position:0%
representative Williams
 
01:04:03.589 --> 01:04:03.599 align:start position:0%
um is anyone here from the Senate to
 
01:04:06.349 --> 01:04:06.359 align:start position:0%
introduce Senate Bill 221 currently
 
01:04:08.390 --> 01:04:08.400 align:start position:0%
there is um if it's right with you I'm
 
01:04:10.010 --> 01:04:10.020 align:start position:0%
going to recess this hearing I'm going
 
01:04:12.470 --> 01:04:12.480 align:start position:0%
to allow the senator to introduce SB 221
 
01:04:13.849 --> 01:04:13.859 align:start position:0%
just to respect their time and we're
 
01:04:15.109 --> 01:04:15.119 align:start position:0%
going to go right back into this hearing
 
01:04:17.150 --> 01:04:17.160 align:start position:0%
so I'm going to recess I'm going to
 
01:04:19.970 --> 01:04:19.980 align:start position:0%
recess SB 170 uh for the purpose of
 
01:04:23.150 --> 01:04:23.160 align:start position:0%
introduction of SB 221 to respect the
 
01:04:25.490 --> 01:04:25.500 align:start position:0%
Senator's time and we're going to come
 
01:04:27.230 --> 01:04:27.240 align:start position:0%
right back what I will do is I'll the
 
01:04:29.030 --> 01:04:29.040 align:start position:0%
center will introduce SB 221 I will
 
01:04:30.289 --> 01:04:30.299 align:start position:0%
immediately recess it we'll come right
 
01:04:36.170 --> 01:04:36.180 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:36.180 --> 01:04:38.390 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

01:04:38.390 --> 01:04:38.400 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
01:04:40.309 --> 01:04:40.319 align:start position:0%
thank you so I'm opening the hearing on
 
01:04:44.329 --> 01:04:44.339 align:start position:0%
SB 221 for the purpose of introduction
 
01:04:47.270 --> 01:04:47.280 align:start position:0%
good morning uh chair Barry and members
 
01:04:50.390 --> 01:04:50.400 align:start position:0%
of the special committee on child care
 
01:04:52.609 --> 01:04:52.619 align:start position:0%
it's great to be here this morning
 
01:04:54.349 --> 01:04:54.359 align:start position:0%
um the room was full so I decided to
 
01:04:55.849 --> 01:04:55.859 align:start position:0%
wait in the hall you know like abiding
 
01:04:57.109 --> 01:04:57.119 align:start position:0%
since the Fire Marshals here in
 
01:04:58.910 --> 01:04:58.920 align:start position:0%
particular where we should we should
 
01:05:02.390 --> 01:05:02.400 align:start position:0%
probably like pay attention to occupancy
 
01:05:04.730 --> 01:05:04.740 align:start position:0%
um so uh I come before you this morning
 
01:05:08.510 --> 01:05:08.520 align:start position:0%
to introduce Senate Bill 221 and it's an
 
01:05:10.069 --> 01:05:10.079 align:start position:0%
amended format so let me just talk you
 
01:05:11.750 --> 01:05:11.760 align:start position:0%
through just a little bit about where
 
01:05:13.730 --> 01:05:13.740 align:start position:0%
why we
 
01:05:16.250 --> 01:05:16.260 align:start position:0%
introduced this in the first initially
 
01:05:18.890 --> 01:05:18.900 align:start position:0%
and where we're at now so this bill as
 
01:05:21.109 --> 01:05:21.119 align:start position:0%
proposed as enabling legislation that
 
01:05:23.270 --> 01:05:23.280 align:start position:0%
would allow municipalities to adopt a
 
01:05:25.250 --> 01:05:25.260 align:start position:0%
property tax exception again this is for
 
01:05:26.809 --> 01:05:26.819 align:start position:0%
local legislative bodies if they so
 
01:05:29.630 --> 01:05:29.640 align:start position:0%
choose for child care agencies the
 
01:05:31.250 --> 01:05:31.260 align:start position:0%
purpose of this I mean this is an all
 
01:05:33.470 --> 01:05:33.480 align:start position:0%
hands on deck situation and trying to
 
01:05:37.390 --> 01:05:37.400 align:start position:0%
find solutions to the child care
 
01:05:40.609 --> 01:05:40.619 align:start position:0%
Workforce issue and the City of Lebanon
 
01:05:42.109 --> 01:05:42.119 align:start position:0%
working with
 
01:05:45.589 --> 01:05:45.599 align:start position:0%
oh it's over 470 businesses throughout
 
01:05:47.270 --> 01:05:47.280 align:start position:0%
the Upper Valley so you're going to see
 
01:05:49.990 --> 01:05:50.000 align:start position:0%
it's a study committee now but I just
 
01:05:53.569 --> 01:05:53.579 align:start position:0%
when it came out the door it was in this
 
01:05:56.150 --> 01:05:56.160 align:start position:0%
in in this format that's that's not what
 
01:05:59.510 --> 01:05:59.520 align:start position:0%
it says wait a minute so we should be
 
01:06:01.370 --> 01:06:01.380 align:start position:0%
looking at establishing a study
 
01:06:03.710 --> 01:06:03.720 align:start position:0%
committee to examine Day Care access and
 
01:06:06.109 --> 01:06:06.119 align:start position:0%
affordability and if you look at the
 
01:06:10.549 --> 01:06:10.559 align:start position:0%
what's it in section three on duties it
 
01:06:11.930 --> 01:06:11.940 align:start position:0%
talks about number three the feasibility
 
01:06:14.930 --> 01:06:14.940 align:start position:0%
and cost of an optional Municipal
 
01:06:16.670 --> 01:06:16.680 align:start position:0%
property tax exception for child day
 
01:06:18.470 --> 01:06:18.480 align:start position:0%
care agencies so that's why so it's
 
01:06:20.030 --> 01:06:20.040 align:start position:0%
still a study committee absolutely okay
 
01:06:21.589 --> 01:06:21.599 align:start position:0%
I started it with this
 
01:06:24.650 --> 01:06:24.660 align:start position:0%
is our initial proposal and then because
 
01:06:27.410 --> 01:06:27.420 align:start position:0%
often with study committees and I'm
 
01:06:29.569 --> 01:06:29.579 align:start position:0%
clear like we there's plenty of them and
 
01:06:31.309 --> 01:06:31.319 align:start position:0%
we have to be very judicious about
 
01:06:33.710 --> 01:06:33.720 align:start position:0%
putting these together but there were
 
01:06:35.210 --> 01:06:35.220 align:start position:0%
more questions and there were answers
 
01:06:37.970 --> 01:06:37.980 align:start position:0%
and this is a different opportunity a
 
01:06:39.470 --> 01:06:39.480 align:start position:0%
different type of solution at least the
 
01:06:41.750 --> 01:06:41.760 align:start position:0%
municipal tax exemption but it led to
 
01:06:43.190 --> 01:06:43.200 align:start position:0%
questions between the difference of
 
01:06:46.069 --> 01:06:46.079 align:start position:0%
charitable organizations and not for
 
01:06:48.890 --> 01:06:48.900 align:start position:0%
profits and that grew into questions
 
01:06:51.829 --> 01:06:51.839 align:start position:0%
about regulations around Workforce
 
01:06:54.049 --> 01:06:54.059 align:start position:0%
related as you can see in here Workforce
 
01:06:56.990 --> 01:06:57.000 align:start position:0%
related license restrictions it could
 
01:07:00.349 --> 01:07:00.359 align:start position:0%
limit Child Care Workforce limit access
 
01:07:02.750 --> 01:07:02.760 align:start position:0%
to local daycare options so the
 
01:07:04.549 --> 01:07:04.559 align:start position:0%
committee and consultation with the
 
01:07:06.650 --> 01:07:06.660 align:start position:0%
leadership of the committee I agreed
 
01:07:08.329 --> 01:07:08.339 align:start position:0%
that there were more issues than just
 
01:07:11.390 --> 01:07:11.400 align:start position:0%
this and we all again agreed that we
 
01:07:13.789 --> 01:07:13.799 align:start position:0%
have to be looking at things differently
 
01:07:14.930 --> 01:07:14.940 align:start position:0%
and trying to come up with different
 
01:07:17.569 --> 01:07:17.579 align:start position:0%
solutions I want to say in the initial
 
01:07:19.250 --> 01:07:19.260 align:start position:0%
version I'm just really proud of the
 
01:07:22.309 --> 01:07:22.319 align:start position:0%
fact that local businesses really banded
 
01:07:24.529 --> 01:07:24.539 align:start position:0%
together with government and tried to
 
01:07:26.569 --> 01:07:26.579 align:start position:0%
figure you know like how can we address
 
01:07:28.609 --> 01:07:28.619 align:start position:0%
this differently and that's how this all
 
01:07:32.089 --> 01:07:32.099 align:start position:0%
started so that's the background on how
 
01:07:34.789 --> 01:07:34.799 align:start position:0%
I got to how I how I initially got in
 
01:07:35.990 --> 01:07:36.000 align:start position:0%
front of a
 
01:07:38.029 --> 01:07:38.039 align:start position:0%
from the Senate on well what I
 
01:07:39.349 --> 01:07:39.359 align:start position:0%
introduced in the Senate and how it's
 
01:07:40.970 --> 01:07:40.980 align:start position:0%
grown over time because there are
 
01:07:43.130 --> 01:07:43.140 align:start position:0%
questions that we still um need to we
 
01:07:44.630 --> 01:07:44.640 align:start position:0%
need to resolve charitable organizations
 
01:07:47.029 --> 01:07:47.039 align:start position:0%
not all agencies are not-for-profit
 
01:07:48.589 --> 01:07:48.599 align:start position:0%
Licensing and Regulatory restrictions
 
01:07:50.809 --> 01:07:50.819 align:start position:0%
around operating a local daycare
 
01:07:53.809 --> 01:07:53.819 align:start position:0%
including Workforce so I agreed that we
 
01:07:57.710 --> 01:07:57.720 align:start position:0%
should we should uh embark on a study on
 
01:07:59.270 --> 01:07:59.280 align:start position:0%
this and that's why I'm before you today
 
01:08:01.430 --> 01:08:01.440 align:start position:0%
and I'm happy to answer any questions
 
01:08:04.430 --> 01:08:04.440 align:start position:0%
you have and I hope that I can find your
 
01:08:05.990 --> 01:08:06.000 align:start position:0%
support to move forward with this thank
 
01:08:07.609 --> 01:08:07.619 align:start position:0%
you okay are there brief questions on
 
01:08:08.809 --> 01:08:08.819 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
01:08:11.809 --> 01:08:11.819 align:start position:0%
okay as thing done thank you so much uh
 
01:08:14.569 --> 01:08:14.579 align:start position:0%
I'm going to recess SB 221 uh the public
 
01:08:15.770 --> 01:08:15.780 align:start position:0%
hearing we're going to go right back
 
01:08:17.809 --> 01:08:17.819 align:start position:0%
into this uh we we recessed the previous
 
01:08:19.370 --> 01:08:19.380 align:start position:0%
one to allow you to introduce to respect
 
01:08:21.169 --> 01:08:21.179 align:start position:0%
your time thank you you're welcome I I
 
01:08:22.669 --> 01:08:22.679 align:start position:0%
have sat out for hours waiting for
 
01:08:25.189 --> 01:08:25.199 align:start position:0%
probability introduce so I I I respect
 
01:08:27.289 --> 01:08:27.299 align:start position:0%
people's time um so we are it's not that
 
01:08:28.550 --> 01:08:28.560 align:start position:0%
we're disregarding your bill we're just
 
01:08:29.709 --> 01:08:29.719 align:start position:0%
coming back
 
01:08:32.329 --> 01:08:32.339 align:start position:0%
we're coming back to it all right thank
 
01:08:34.130 --> 01:08:34.140 align:start position:0%
you we're gonna so I'm gonna reopen the
 
01:08:36.769 --> 01:08:36.779 align:start position:0%
um public hearing on SB 170 uh relative
 
01:08:38.689 --> 01:08:38.699 align:start position:0%
to small group day centers I believe the
 
01:08:40.669 --> 01:08:40.679 align:start position:0%
deputy Fire Marshal was in the middle of
 
01:08:42.950 --> 01:08:42.960 align:start position:0%
a uh definitely not a debate with
 
01:08:44.269 --> 01:08:44.279 align:start position:0%
representative McWilliams put a question
 
01:08:47.269 --> 01:08:47.279 align:start position:0%
and answer period yeah and I apologize
 
01:08:49.130 --> 01:08:49.140 align:start position:0%
for interrupting represent McWilliams I
 
01:08:50.510 --> 01:08:50.520 align:start position:0%
hope you understand my reasoning behind
 
01:08:57.289 --> 01:08:57.299 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:59.510 --> 01:08:59.520 align:start position:0%
thank you because I really want to be
 
01:09:02.209 --> 01:09:02.219 align:start position:0%
fair and I'm concerned about fairness
 
01:09:03.709 --> 01:09:03.719 align:start position:0%
okay that's really the underlying
 
01:09:04.849 --> 01:09:04.859 align:start position:0%
concern here
 
01:09:09.610 --> 01:09:09.620 align:start position:0%
so the number 12 right 7 to 12 children
 
01:09:13.249 --> 01:09:13.259 align:start position:0%
I feel like that number 12 has in the
 
01:09:15.709 --> 01:09:15.719 align:start position:0%
past been more than 12 because the
 
01:09:18.349 --> 01:09:18.359 align:start position:0%
requirements are met for inspections and
 
01:09:19.849 --> 01:09:19.859 align:start position:0%
whatever the additional building
 
01:09:22.249 --> 01:09:22.259 align:start position:0%
components that are necessary to reach
 
01:09:24.590 --> 01:09:24.600 align:start position:0%
15 or 18 whatever that number is in a
 
01:09:25.669 --> 01:09:25.679 align:start position:0%
home child care
 
01:09:28.309 --> 01:09:28.319 align:start position:0%
and so
 
01:09:31.189 --> 01:09:31.199 align:start position:0%
the number 12 just looking at this from
 
01:09:32.689 --> 01:09:32.699 align:start position:0%
someone who's coming at this from the
 
01:09:34.309 --> 01:09:34.319 align:start position:0%
outside hasn't been attending your
 
01:09:36.829 --> 01:09:36.839 align:start position:0%
working sessions I feel like that is
 
01:09:40.070 --> 01:09:40.080 align:start position:0%
limiting for future new facilities
 
01:09:41.689 --> 01:09:41.699 align:start position:0%
within a home
 
01:09:43.610 --> 01:09:43.620 align:start position:0%
but it doesn't have to be because the
 
01:09:46.849 --> 01:09:46.859 align:start position:0%
code may actually allow 15 or 18. we are
 
01:09:48.950 --> 01:09:48.960 align:start position:0%
just deciding in statute the 12 is the
 
01:09:48.960 --> 01:09:50.390 align:start position:0%
just deciding in statute the 12 is the
cap

01:09:50.390 --> 01:09:50.400 align:start position:0%
cap
 
01:09:52.189 --> 01:09:52.199 align:start position:0%
is that your take on this or is there
 
01:09:53.930 --> 01:09:53.940 align:start position:0%
more to it
 
01:09:55.550 --> 01:09:55.560 align:start position:0%
um thank you for the question 12 is
 
01:09:59.330 --> 01:09:59.340 align:start position:0%
again 12 that number 12 comes directly
 
01:10:01.669 --> 01:10:01.679 align:start position:0%
out of the state fire code so that it
 
01:10:03.169 --> 01:10:03.179 align:start position:0%
wasn't an arbitrary number that the
 
01:10:06.470 --> 01:10:06.480 align:start position:0%
committee developed it was aligning
 
01:10:09.470 --> 01:10:09.480 align:start position:0%
these discussions with when we look at
 
01:10:13.130 --> 01:10:13.140 align:start position:0%
capacity you know you know
 
01:10:15.830 --> 01:10:15.840 align:start position:0%
that the numbers align with the
 
01:10:17.150 --> 01:10:17.160 align:start position:0%
prescriptive requirements under the
 
01:10:19.850 --> 01:10:19.860 align:start position:0%
state fire code so when we start talking
 
01:10:22.669 --> 01:10:22.679 align:start position:0%
about existing daycares that have been
 
01:10:24.590 --> 01:10:24.600 align:start position:0%
licensed for
 
01:10:26.510 --> 01:10:26.520 align:start position:0%
more than 12.
 
01:10:29.570 --> 01:10:29.580 align:start position:0%
understanding that they
 
01:10:31.729 --> 01:10:31.739 align:start position:0%
in the perfect world have already met
 
01:10:33.530 --> 01:10:33.540 align:start position:0%
the requirements that they would need to
 
01:10:36.350 --> 01:10:36.360 align:start position:0%
meet for those
 
01:10:37.910 --> 01:10:37.920 align:start position:0%
um the the under the prescriptive fire
 
01:10:40.669 --> 01:10:40.679 align:start position:0%
code we've run into situations I've run
 
01:10:42.830 --> 01:10:42.840 align:start position:0%
into it personally in the past where you
 
01:10:44.630 --> 01:10:44.640 align:start position:0%
have a daycare that has
 
01:10:47.090 --> 01:10:47.100 align:start position:0%
10 children and they want to go to 15
 
01:10:49.610 --> 01:10:49.620 align:start position:0%
they want to go to 20. then they would
 
01:10:51.169 --> 01:10:51.179 align:start position:0%
have to go through the process to make
 
01:10:52.790 --> 01:10:52.800 align:start position:0%
sure that they're meeting the
 
01:10:54.350 --> 01:10:54.360 align:start position:0%
appropriate requirements under the state
 
01:10:55.970 --> 01:10:55.980 align:start position:0%
fire code in the State Building Code so
 
01:10:58.370 --> 01:10:58.380 align:start position:0%
if that's if that's a business model
 
01:11:01.189 --> 01:11:01.199 align:start position:0%
that they choose to go down in in that
 
01:11:03.290 --> 01:11:03.300 align:start position:0%
endeavor and they want to expand beyond
 
01:11:05.510 --> 01:11:05.520 align:start position:0%
that 12 then they would have to meet the
 
01:11:07.130 --> 01:11:07.140 align:start position:0%
prescriptive requirements of the state
 
01:11:08.510 --> 01:11:08.520 align:start position:0%
fire code and the State Building Code as
 
01:11:10.209 --> 01:11:10.219 align:start position:0%
they sit
 
01:11:13.310 --> 01:11:13.320 align:start position:0%
well so talk to me about the process for
 
01:11:14.930 --> 01:11:14.940 align:start position:0%
doing that do we have a separate
 
01:11:19.490 --> 01:11:19.500 align:start position:0%
category for 13 to X so the way the fire
 
01:11:22.729 --> 01:11:22.739 align:start position:0%
code is written it's up to 12 uh and
 
01:11:27.110 --> 01:11:27.120 align:start position:0%
then more than 12 falls under a daycare
 
01:11:30.350 --> 01:11:30.360 align:start position:0%
occupancy under the fire code so
 
01:11:32.630 --> 01:11:32.640 align:start position:0%
three to six is
 
01:11:34.430 --> 01:11:34.440 align:start position:0%
Family Day Care
 
01:11:37.430 --> 01:11:37.440 align:start position:0%
six seven to twelve becomes group
 
01:11:42.050 --> 01:11:42.060 align:start position:0%
daycare and then more than 12 becomes a
 
01:11:43.970 --> 01:11:43.980 align:start position:0%
daycare center if you will or under the
 
01:11:45.950 --> 01:11:45.960 align:start position:0%
fire code and I'm transcribing those
 
01:11:47.689 --> 01:11:47.699 align:start position:0%
terms but it's three to six seven to
 
01:11:50.510 --> 01:11:50.520 align:start position:0%
twelve and more than 12. so depending on
 
01:11:52.910 --> 01:11:52.920 align:start position:0%
the number of children that the
 
01:11:56.510 --> 01:11:56.520 align:start position:0%
proprietor wants to take care of they
 
01:11:59.390 --> 01:11:59.400 align:start position:0%
would fall into one of those groups and
 
01:12:01.669 --> 01:12:01.679 align:start position:0%
if they wanted to move between the
 
01:12:03.470 --> 01:12:03.480 align:start position:0%
groups they would have to meet the
 
01:12:05.209 --> 01:12:05.219 align:start position:0%
prescriptive requirements
 
01:12:07.850 --> 01:12:07.860 align:start position:0%
that are necessary so again that magic
 
01:12:10.070 --> 01:12:10.080 align:start position:0%
number of 12 if you will has been
 
01:12:11.870 --> 01:12:11.880 align:start position:0%
established under the state fire code it
 
01:12:13.610 --> 01:12:13.620 align:start position:0%
wasn't just an arbitrary number we use
 
01:12:15.830 --> 01:12:15.840 align:start position:0%
that number deliberately understanding
 
01:12:18.470 --> 01:12:18.480 align:start position:0%
that the requirements change once you
 
01:12:20.810 --> 01:12:20.820 align:start position:0%
get over that more than 12.
 
01:12:22.550 --> 01:12:22.560 align:start position:0%
okay so I'm feeling like this
 
01:12:25.430 --> 01:12:25.440 align:start position:0%
grandfather piece is not applicable and
 
01:12:27.229 --> 01:12:27.239 align:start position:0%
the folks that have more than 12 should
 
01:12:29.090 --> 01:12:29.100 align:start position:0%
just go through the process of applying
 
01:12:31.970 --> 01:12:31.980 align:start position:0%
to become a daycare facility straight
 
01:12:31.980 --> 01:12:32.990 align:start position:0%
to become a daycare facility straight
out

01:12:32.990 --> 01:12:33.000 align:start position:0%
out
 
01:12:35.750 --> 01:12:35.760 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that the again the
 
01:12:38.570 --> 01:12:38.580 align:start position:0%
the fire code discussion is part of this
 
01:12:40.910 --> 01:12:40.920 align:start position:0%
is aligning the language in the fire
 
01:12:43.610 --> 01:12:43.620 align:start position:0%
code with the language in DHHS rules uh
 
01:12:46.850 --> 01:12:46.860 align:start position:0%
one thing that we've noticed is that
 
01:12:49.250 --> 01:12:49.260 align:start position:0%
when we have conversations with fire
 
01:12:51.410 --> 01:12:51.420 align:start position:0%
inspectors or fire officials the
 
01:12:53.689 --> 01:12:53.699 align:start position:0%
terminology becomes a little bit messy
 
01:12:55.729 --> 01:12:55.739 align:start position:0%
and one of the things that we've worked
 
01:12:57.649 --> 01:12:57.659 align:start position:0%
very hard to do with this group is clean
 
01:12:59.870 --> 01:12:59.880 align:start position:0%
up that language and again I can't I'm
 
01:13:01.310 --> 01:13:01.320 align:start position:0%
not going to speak to the licensing side
 
01:13:03.770 --> 01:13:03.780 align:start position:0%
of it but to be able to
 
01:13:06.050 --> 01:13:06.060 align:start position:0%
align the licensing language with the
 
01:13:07.850 --> 01:13:07.860 align:start position:0%
fire code language so that when you have
 
01:13:11.330 --> 01:13:11.340 align:start position:0%
a fire inspector in XYZ community that
 
01:13:13.729 --> 01:13:13.739 align:start position:0%
they're saying the same thing is that is
 
01:13:15.110 --> 01:13:15.120 align:start position:0%
found under the fire code because
 
01:13:19.490 --> 01:13:19.500 align:start position:0%
sometimes okay that the you know the
 
01:13:22.430 --> 01:13:22.440 align:start position:0%
fire inspector can say well you're only
 
01:13:24.470 --> 01:13:24.480 align:start position:0%
you know you can only have 12 but the
 
01:13:26.330 --> 01:13:26.340 align:start position:0%
license allows for 15. well no you're
 
01:13:28.189 --> 01:13:28.199 align:start position:0%
limited by the 12 under the fire code so
 
01:13:31.430 --> 01:13:31.440 align:start position:0%
there's this bill hopes to clean that
 
01:13:33.890 --> 01:13:33.900 align:start position:0%
clean up some of those discrepancies so
 
01:13:35.930 --> 01:13:35.940 align:start position:0%
that those don't become issues and it
 
01:13:38.209 --> 01:13:38.219 align:start position:0%
just becomes a point of confusion that
 
01:13:40.189 --> 01:13:40.199 align:start position:0%
they're able to be worked through on
 
01:13:42.050 --> 01:13:42.060 align:start position:0%
with discussion but if we can clean it
 
01:13:44.090 --> 01:13:44.100 align:start position:0%
up now it just makes it that much easier
 
01:13:46.370 --> 01:13:46.380 align:start position:0%
moving forward and uh
 
01:13:48.470 --> 01:13:48.480 align:start position:0%
so thank you I just I think that we
 
01:13:51.530 --> 01:13:51.540 align:start position:0%
would want to strike the um
 
01:13:53.330 --> 01:13:53.340 align:start position:0%
this actual not apply to programs
 
01:13:54.950 --> 01:13:54.960 align:start position:0%
already licensed before the effective
 
01:13:56.149 --> 01:13:56.159 align:start position:0%
date of this act I think we would want
 
01:13:58.850 --> 01:13:58.860 align:start position:0%
to strike that In fairness so that those
 
01:14:00.649 --> 01:14:00.659 align:start position:0%
programs that are already licensed but
 
01:14:02.870 --> 01:14:02.880 align:start position:0%
have more than 12 need to go and get
 
01:14:05.870 --> 01:14:05.880 align:start position:0%
licensed under the 13 plus category
 
01:14:08.030 --> 01:14:08.040 align:start position:0%
that's enough for me to speak but we'll
 
01:14:09.410 --> 01:14:09.420 align:start position:0%
have to have that that's uh we'll have
 
01:14:11.270 --> 01:14:11.280 align:start position:0%
to have that conversation in our duly
 
01:14:12.950 --> 01:14:12.960 align:start position:0%
noticed work schedule uh work session
 
01:14:14.990 --> 01:14:15.000 align:start position:0%
which starts in three minutes
 
01:14:16.790 --> 01:14:16.800 align:start position:0%
um allegedly
 
01:14:19.870 --> 01:14:19.880 align:start position:0%
um representative walner
 
01:14:23.810 --> 01:14:23.820 align:start position:0%
thank you so you refer often to the
 
01:14:25.970 --> 01:14:25.980 align:start position:0%
state fire code could this have been
 
01:14:28.689 --> 01:14:28.699 align:start position:0%
handled differently and actually have
 
01:14:30.830 --> 01:14:30.840 align:start position:0%
changed the number
 
01:14:33.590 --> 01:14:33.600 align:start position:0%
in the state fire code
 
01:14:33.600 --> 01:14:35.149 align:start position:0%
in the state fire code
from

01:14:35.149 --> 01:14:35.159 align:start position:0%
from
 
01:14:37.370 --> 01:14:37.380 align:start position:0%
a family Child Care Group family child
 
01:14:40.729 --> 01:14:40.739 align:start position:0%
care being 12 plus the after school
 
01:14:43.390 --> 01:14:43.400 align:start position:0%
could that have been done as opposed to
 
01:14:46.490 --> 01:14:46.500 align:start position:0%
the way it's being done anything's
 
01:14:46.500 --> 01:14:52.630 align:start position:0%
the way it's being done anything's
possible

01:14:52.630 --> 01:14:52.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:55.490 --> 01:14:55.500 align:start position:0%
there is a process to modify the state
 
01:14:56.810 --> 01:14:56.820 align:start position:0%
fire code
 
01:14:58.790 --> 01:14:58.800 align:start position:0%
um the decision the discussions that
 
01:15:01.070 --> 01:15:01.080 align:start position:0%
were had were to bring
 
01:15:03.530 --> 01:15:03.540 align:start position:0%
the Fire Marshal's Office on board with
 
01:15:05.209 --> 01:15:05.219 align:start position:0%
these discussions as a technical
 
01:15:07.850 --> 01:15:07.860 align:start position:0%
resource to ensure that as these the
 
01:15:09.770 --> 01:15:09.780 align:start position:0%
language of this bill was written that
 
01:15:11.390 --> 01:15:11.400 align:start position:0%
it didn't create a conflict with the
 
01:15:12.590 --> 01:15:12.600 align:start position:0%
state fire code or the State Building
 
01:15:16.310 --> 01:15:16.320 align:start position:0%
Code so that we were providing insight
 
01:15:19.070 --> 01:15:19.080 align:start position:0%
and information based upon the way that
 
01:15:22.030 --> 01:15:22.040 align:start position:0%
the code was prescriptively written
 
01:15:26.149 --> 01:15:26.159 align:start position:0%
yes so if I have 12 I have a license for
 
01:15:26.159 --> 01:15:27.470 align:start position:0%
yes so if I have 12 I have a license for
12

01:15:27.470 --> 01:15:27.480 align:start position:0%
12
 
01:15:27.480 --> 01:15:28.130 align:start position:0%
12
um

01:15:28.130 --> 01:15:28.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:15:30.470 --> 01:15:30.480 align:start position:0%
younger than probably younger than six
 
01:15:33.470 --> 01:15:33.480 align:start position:0%
that are in my home and I'm allowed to
 
01:15:33.480 --> 01:15:35.169 align:start position:0%
that are in my home and I'm allowed to
five

01:15:35.169 --> 01:15:35.179 align:start position:0%
five
 
01:15:38.750 --> 01:15:38.760 align:start position:0%
now if I don't have a license that I'm
 
01:15:41.689 --> 01:15:41.699 align:start position:0%
going to decide to have a 12 and I want
 
01:15:43.669 --> 01:15:43.679 align:start position:0%
to have five school-aged children after
 
01:15:47.390 --> 01:15:47.400 align:start position:0%
school I have to go now I can I can get
 
01:15:49.490 --> 01:15:49.500 align:start position:0%
a license but I have to go to the
 
01:15:52.550 --> 01:15:52.560 align:start position:0%
center-based license is that correct
 
01:15:54.590 --> 01:15:54.600 align:start position:0%
I'm not familiar with the licensing
 
01:15:57.050 --> 01:15:57.060 align:start position:0%
terms yeah yeah
 
01:15:59.570 --> 01:15:59.580 align:start position:0%
which means that I fall into a category
 
01:16:02.810 --> 01:16:02.820 align:start position:0%
that is more of a
 
01:16:02.820 --> 01:16:03.890 align:start position:0%
that is more of a
it

01:16:03.890 --> 01:16:03.900 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:16:07.850 --> 01:16:07.860 align:start position:0%
more regulated and it's a large it can
 
01:16:10.490 --> 01:16:10.500 align:start position:0%
go up to 100 children when so it goes
 
01:16:11.870 --> 01:16:11.880 align:start position:0%
from 12 to
 
01:16:13.390 --> 01:16:13.400 align:start position:0%
whatever thank you for your question
 
01:16:15.649 --> 01:16:15.659 align:start position:0%
initially when you initially went from
 
01:16:18.709 --> 01:16:18.719 align:start position:0%
your 12 plus 5 your your occupancy your
 
01:16:20.450 --> 01:16:20.460 align:start position:0%
building should have been inspected to
 
01:16:23.390 --> 01:16:23.400 align:start position:0%
17. the fire department or the the
 
01:16:25.370 --> 01:16:25.380 align:start position:0%
inspecting agencies never should have
 
01:16:27.290 --> 01:16:27.300 align:start position:0%
inspected it to 12 they should have
 
01:16:30.470 --> 01:16:30.480 align:start position:0%
inspected it to that 17 if you will and
 
01:16:32.390 --> 01:16:32.400 align:start position:0%
the requirements that would have been
 
01:16:35.149 --> 01:16:35.159 align:start position:0%
set forth your your property would
 
01:16:37.430 --> 01:16:37.440 align:start position:0%
already meet the requirements for having
 
01:16:40.490 --> 01:16:40.500 align:start position:0%
that number of student children in that
 
01:16:40.500 --> 01:16:42.050 align:start position:0%
that number of student children in that
occupancy

01:16:42.050 --> 01:16:42.060 align:start position:0%
occupancy
 
01:16:44.270 --> 01:16:44.280 align:start position:0%
so it wouldn't it's you were you would
 
01:16:47.570 --> 01:16:47.580 align:start position:0%
have been inspected at 17 the the plus
 
01:16:49.010 --> 01:16:49.020 align:start position:0%
five the plus three whatever that
 
01:16:51.830 --> 01:16:51.840 align:start position:0%
discussion is for licensing purposes is
 
01:16:53.810 --> 01:16:53.820 align:start position:0%
irrelevant to the fire code as as the
 
01:16:56.330 --> 01:16:56.340 align:start position:0%
fire code says 13 or more or more than
 
01:16:59.090 --> 01:16:59.100 align:start position:0%
12. you meet these requirements and in
 
01:17:00.490 --> 01:17:00.500 align:start position:0%
this particular case you would have been
 
01:17:02.570 --> 01:17:02.580 align:start position:0%
you would have met the requirements for
 
01:17:04.729 --> 01:17:04.739 align:start position:0%
your 17.
 
01:17:08.030 --> 01:17:08.040 align:start position:0%
so how much difference is there between
 
01:17:12.110 --> 01:17:12.120 align:start position:0%
the requirements for 12 and the
 
01:17:13.970 --> 01:17:13.980 align:start position:0%
requirements for this center-based
 
01:17:17.630 --> 01:17:17.640 align:start position:0%
license that could go up to a hundred
 
01:17:20.570 --> 01:17:20.580 align:start position:0%
I can I don't have them specifically I I
 
01:17:22.310 --> 01:17:22.320 align:start position:0%
don't it would be a disservice to try
 
01:17:24.830 --> 01:17:24.840 align:start position:0%
and repeat them verbatim without going
 
01:17:27.050 --> 01:17:27.060 align:start position:0%
through the document and providing those
 
01:17:28.790 --> 01:17:28.800 align:start position:0%
differences if that's something the
 
01:17:29.990 --> 01:17:30.000 align:start position:0%
committee would like we can certainly
 
01:17:32.030 --> 01:17:32.040 align:start position:0%
work on putting that together
 
01:17:33.830 --> 01:17:33.840 align:start position:0%
uh thank you would you say it's
 
01:17:33.840 --> 01:17:34.910 align:start position:0%
uh thank you would you say it's
significant

01:17:34.910 --> 01:17:34.920 align:start position:0%
significant
 
01:17:37.850 --> 01:17:37.860 align:start position:0%
potentially depending on it it depends
 
01:17:40.669 --> 01:17:40.679 align:start position:0%
right as an architect it depends it
 
01:17:40.679 --> 01:17:41.810 align:start position:0%
right as an architect it depends it
um

01:17:41.810 --> 01:17:41.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:17:44.510 --> 01:17:44.520 align:start position:0%
representative representation thank you
 
01:17:47.270 --> 01:17:47.280 align:start position:0%
um just for clarity for for General fire
 
01:17:49.850 --> 01:17:49.860 align:start position:0%
code not necessarily for daycare but is
 
01:17:53.530 --> 01:17:53.540 align:start position:0%
that sort of the same step like from 12
 
01:17:56.209 --> 01:17:56.219 align:start position:0%
has one thing and then it goes up to 100
 
01:17:58.370 --> 01:17:58.380 align:start position:0%
or are there sort of gradations normally
 
01:18:01.490 --> 01:18:01.500 align:start position:0%
for medium occupancies
 
01:18:03.649 --> 01:18:03.659 align:start position:0%
it depends on the occupancy
 
01:18:05.270 --> 01:18:05.280 align:start position:0%
um you know it depends on the use of the
 
01:18:08.390 --> 01:18:08.400 align:start position:0%
space uh it depends on what is occurring
 
01:18:10.729 --> 01:18:10.739 align:start position:0%
is it a is it a business use is it a
 
01:18:13.250 --> 01:18:13.260 align:start position:0%
restaurant is it a nightclub is it a
 
01:18:16.070 --> 01:18:16.080 align:start position:0%
daycare is it a school so the fire code
 
01:18:18.470 --> 01:18:18.480 align:start position:0%
the state fire code is full of occupancy
 
01:18:21.050 --> 01:18:21.060 align:start position:0%
limits in terms of numbers if if there's
 
01:18:22.610 --> 01:18:22.620 align:start position:0%
this many numbers you go here if there's
 
01:18:26.149 --> 01:18:26.159 align:start position:0%
this many people you go here so to say a
 
01:18:28.669 --> 01:18:28.679 align:start position:0%
small medium or large if you will is
 
01:18:31.130 --> 01:18:31.140 align:start position:0%
it it's not necessarily applicable to
 
01:18:34.010 --> 01:18:34.020 align:start position:0%
all occupancies but again when we look
 
01:18:36.530 --> 01:18:36.540 align:start position:0%
at occupancies as a as a whole
 
01:18:38.450 --> 01:18:38.460 align:start position:0%
the number of people that you can put
 
01:18:41.270 --> 01:18:41.280 align:start position:0%
into them obviously becomes Paramount to
 
01:18:42.649 --> 01:18:42.659 align:start position:0%
making sure that the proper safety
 
01:18:44.810 --> 01:18:44.820 align:start position:0%
features are put in place
 
01:18:44.820 --> 01:18:46.070 align:start position:0%
features are put in place
oh

01:18:46.070 --> 01:18:46.080 align:start position:0%
oh
 
01:18:48.590 --> 01:18:48.600 align:start position:0%
so you might have a situation where you
 
01:18:51.290 --> 01:18:51.300 align:start position:0%
know for an occupancy of 50 there's kind
 
01:18:55.850 --> 01:18:55.860 align:start position:0%
of a medium or medium features different
 
01:18:57.350 --> 01:18:57.360 align:start position:0%
features than it would be for an
 
01:19:00.649 --> 01:19:00.659 align:start position:0%
occupancy of 100 or for 200. so a an
 
01:19:02.209 --> 01:19:02.219 align:start position:0%
Excel I'll give you an example if you
 
01:19:05.390 --> 01:19:05.400 align:start position:0%
have a business if you will that has 30
 
01:19:07.669 --> 01:19:07.679 align:start position:0%
people in it you may only have to have
 
01:19:11.390 --> 01:19:11.400 align:start position:0%
one door out of that space if you have a
 
01:19:13.310 --> 01:19:13.320 align:start position:0%
business that has 100 people you may
 
01:19:15.229 --> 01:19:15.239 align:start position:0%
need two doors out of that space and
 
01:19:17.570 --> 01:19:17.580 align:start position:0%
where those doors are located is based
 
01:19:20.209 --> 01:19:20.219 align:start position:0%
upon how long it takes the people to get
 
01:19:22.189 --> 01:19:22.199 align:start position:0%
from point A to point B to the outside
 
01:19:24.169 --> 01:19:24.179 align:start position:0%
so it
 
01:19:27.590 --> 01:19:27.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:30.290 --> 01:19:30.300 align:start position:0%
for the questions for the deputy fire
 
01:19:31.810 --> 01:19:31.820 align:start position:0%
marshal or Deputy
 
01:19:33.530 --> 01:19:33.540 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
01:19:35.270 --> 01:19:35.280 align:start position:0%
okay uh thank you
 
01:19:37.370 --> 01:19:37.380 align:start position:0%
um can we make sure you fill out a pink
 
01:19:38.870 --> 01:19:38.880 align:start position:0%
card for me
 
01:19:41.689 --> 01:19:41.699 align:start position:0%
um I'm gonna recess
 
01:19:41.699 --> 01:19:42.350 align:start position:0%
um I'm gonna recess
um

01:19:42.350 --> 01:19:42.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:19:43.850 --> 01:19:43.860 align:start position:0%
this hearing real quickly I'm going to
 
01:19:45.709 --> 01:19:45.719 align:start position:0%
open up our work session because I have
 
01:19:47.570 --> 01:19:47.580 align:start position:0%
to put to a question to the committee uh
 
01:19:49.490 --> 01:19:49.500 align:start position:0%
before noon
 
01:19:49.500 --> 01:19:50.149 align:start position:0%
before noon
um

01:19:50.149 --> 01:19:50.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:19:52.790 --> 01:19:52.800 align:start position:0%
in order to meet the scheduling rules of
 
01:19:54.290 --> 01:19:54.300 align:start position:0%
the house if we wanted to meet next week
 
01:19:56.209 --> 01:19:56.219 align:start position:0%
I need to notice the bills that we are
 
01:19:57.290 --> 01:19:57.300 align:start position:0%
currently hearing because we haven't
 
01:19:59.149 --> 01:19:59.159 align:start position:0%
closed our public hearing yet
 
01:19:59.159 --> 01:20:00.060 align:start position:0%
closed our public hearing yet
um

01:20:00.060 --> 01:20:00.070 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:20:00.070 --> 01:20:01.189 align:start position:0%
um
[Music]

01:20:01.189 --> 01:20:01.199 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:20:04.610 --> 01:20:04.620 align:start position:0%
into our committee assistant by noon so
 
01:20:06.169 --> 01:20:06.179 align:start position:0%
the reason I'm I'm opening up a work
 
01:20:07.910 --> 01:20:07.920 align:start position:0%
session to ask this question is if we
 
01:20:09.530 --> 01:20:09.540 align:start position:0%
wanted to introduce a non-germaine
 
01:20:11.090 --> 01:20:11.100 align:start position:0%
Amendment obviously you need to be
 
01:20:13.189 --> 01:20:13.199 align:start position:0%
relative to child care please don't play
 
01:20:13.199 --> 01:20:14.450 align:start position:0%
relative to child care please don't play
games

01:20:14.450 --> 01:20:14.460 align:start position:0%
games
 
01:20:16.910 --> 01:20:16.920 align:start position:0%
um I we would need to we would need
 
01:20:18.350 --> 01:20:18.360 align:start position:0%
another week to schedule that
 
01:20:19.910 --> 01:20:19.920 align:start position:0%
non-germaine hearing because obviously
 
01:20:21.530 --> 01:20:21.540 align:start position:0%
it's not drafted
 
01:20:23.330 --> 01:20:23.340 align:start position:0%
um so I guess I'm just doing a quick
 
01:20:25.130 --> 01:20:25.140 align:start position:0%
pulse of the committee of do you want me
 
01:20:26.450 --> 01:20:26.460 align:start position:0%
to schedule the executive session for
 
01:20:28.070 --> 01:20:28.080 align:start position:0%
these bills that to one of which we have
 
01:20:29.390 --> 01:20:29.400 align:start position:0%
heard to which we are currently hearing
 
01:20:31.430 --> 01:20:31.440 align:start position:0%
uh next week or do you want me to put it
 
01:20:32.930 --> 01:20:32.940 align:start position:0%
into two weeks if it's in two weeks I
 
01:20:34.310 --> 01:20:34.320 align:start position:0%
don't need to send an email but if it's
 
01:20:35.510 --> 01:20:35.520 align:start position:0%
next week I need to send the email in
 
01:20:37.669 --> 01:20:37.679 align:start position:0%
the next uh 40 minutes
 
01:20:39.229 --> 01:20:39.239 align:start position:0%
so I just kind of wanted to survey the
 
01:20:39.239 --> 01:20:44.930 align:start position:0%
so I just kind of wanted to survey the
group

01:20:44.930 --> 01:20:44.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:46.970 --> 01:20:46.980 align:start position:0%
okay all right so next week would
 
01:20:48.530 --> 01:20:48.540 align:start position:0%
eliminate the possibility of any
 
01:20:49.970 --> 01:20:49.980 align:start position:0%
non-germain Amendment so if we get into
 
01:20:52.250 --> 01:20:52.260 align:start position:0%
work session and we find something that
 
01:20:53.689 --> 01:20:53.699 align:start position:0%
we review
 
01:20:55.010 --> 01:20:55.020 align:start position:0%
um that we've heard from our let's see
 
01:20:56.689 --> 01:20:56.699 align:start position:0%
the three four times we have met that we
 
01:20:58.910 --> 01:20:58.920 align:start position:0%
wish to introduce on to a bill that
 
01:21:01.189 --> 01:21:01.199 align:start position:0%
would effectively eliminate that option
 
01:21:03.709 --> 01:21:03.719 align:start position:0%
unless we were to notice the executive
 
01:21:06.229 --> 01:21:06.239 align:start position:0%
session uh and then recess it which we
 
01:21:07.790 --> 01:21:07.800 align:start position:0%
could do
 
01:21:10.729 --> 01:21:10.739 align:start position:0%
so is that the preference
 
01:21:12.830 --> 01:21:12.840 align:start position:0%
it's it's a question anybody can chime
 
01:21:14.330 --> 01:21:14.340 align:start position:0%
in it's a working session it's a it's a
 
01:21:15.830 --> 01:21:15.840 align:start position:0%
preference question
 
01:21:17.570 --> 01:21:17.580 align:start position:0%
I just need to know because I if I don't
 
01:21:19.370 --> 01:21:19.380 align:start position:0%
do it by noon then it's it's the
 
01:21:20.750 --> 01:21:20.760 align:start position:0%
questions it's no longer a question now
 
01:21:22.310 --> 01:21:22.320 align:start position:0%
we're doing it in two weeks yes
 
01:21:22.320 --> 01:21:24.890 align:start position:0%
we're doing it in two weeks yes
representative

01:21:24.890 --> 01:21:24.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:26.330 --> 01:21:26.340 align:start position:0%
so are we
 
01:21:30.470 --> 01:21:30.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:32.390 --> 01:21:32.400 align:start position:0%
that's my intention for the for the work
 
01:21:34.490 --> 01:21:34.500 align:start position:0%
session I didn't expect us to run um I
 
01:21:36.110 --> 01:21:36.120 align:start position:0%
thought this was I thought I did not
 
01:21:37.910 --> 01:21:37.920 align:start position:0%
expect our turnout given our historic uh
 
01:21:39.890 --> 01:21:39.900 align:start position:0%
attendance so I didn't expect this to go
 
01:21:41.810 --> 01:21:41.820 align:start position:0%
as long which I'm very excited about uh
 
01:21:43.729 --> 01:21:43.739 align:start position:0%
but is now creating a unique problem so
 
01:21:45.590 --> 01:21:45.600 align:start position:0%
I think makes sense for us as a
 
01:21:48.050 --> 01:21:48.060 align:start position:0%
committee to work next week and if we
 
01:21:49.610 --> 01:21:49.620 align:start position:0%
feel like we want to do an exact let's
 
01:21:51.229 --> 01:21:51.239 align:start position:0%
notice the exec at the end of the work
 
01:21:53.450 --> 01:21:53.460 align:start position:0%
session for next week and if we open and
 
01:21:55.669 --> 01:21:55.679 align:start position:0%
shut the exact we do that but it gives
 
01:21:57.590 --> 01:21:57.600 align:start position:0%
us the opportunity to at least work
 
01:21:59.270 --> 01:21:59.280 align:start position:0%
through some of these and maybe we get
 
01:22:01.250 --> 01:22:01.260 align:start position:0%
there maybe we don't okay so I think
 
01:22:02.570 --> 01:22:02.580 align:start position:0%
that that's probably the most logical
 
01:22:04.610 --> 01:22:04.620 align:start position:0%
approach that's that's fine by me and
 
01:22:05.930 --> 01:22:05.940 align:start position:0%
that's definitely an opportunity it
 
01:22:07.189 --> 01:22:07.199 align:start position:0%
obviously gives you a little bit shorter
 
01:22:07.199 --> 01:22:08.149 align:start position:0%
obviously gives you a little bit shorter
notice

01:22:08.149 --> 01:22:08.159 align:start position:0%
notice
 
01:22:09.770 --> 01:22:09.780 align:start position:0%
um for if we have to do a follow-up but
 
01:22:11.630 --> 01:22:11.640 align:start position:0%
as long as we're on the same page being
 
01:22:13.189 --> 01:22:13.199 align:start position:0%
transparent about it I don't I don't
 
01:22:14.450 --> 01:22:14.460 align:start position:0%
want to be accused of like pulling a
 
01:22:16.729 --> 01:22:16.739 align:start position:0%
fast one just these are these are the
 
01:22:18.290 --> 01:22:18.300 align:start position:0%
rules that they gave me
 
01:22:19.370 --> 01:22:19.380 align:start position:0%
um anybody else have any questions
 
01:22:20.930 --> 01:22:20.940 align:start position:0%
comments concerns about that and if
 
01:22:22.610 --> 01:22:22.620 align:start position:0%
that's the case I will just notice this
 
01:22:24.830 --> 01:22:24.840 align:start position:0%
for 10 a.m next Wednesday for the
 
01:22:26.030 --> 01:22:26.040 align:start position:0%
exactly then we'll go right back into
 
01:22:27.770 --> 01:22:27.780 align:start position:0%
our hearing
 
01:22:29.990 --> 01:22:30.000 align:start position:0%
um okay without objection I'll do that
 
01:22:31.550 --> 01:22:31.560 align:start position:0%
um so we're gonna we're gonna finish up
 
01:22:33.830 --> 01:22:33.840 align:start position:0%
the I'm going to close recess our work
 
01:22:35.570 --> 01:22:35.580 align:start position:0%
session which we'll come back to
 
01:22:38.149 --> 01:22:38.159 align:start position:0%
um a lot of recesses uh and we're going
 
01:22:41.149 --> 01:22:41.159 align:start position:0%
to reopen the public hearing on SB 170
 
01:22:42.229 --> 01:22:42.239 align:start position:0%
which I get the feeling I'm about to
 
01:22:42.239 --> 01:22:43.610 align:start position:0%
which I get the feeling I'm about to
close

01:22:43.610 --> 01:22:43.620 align:start position:0%
close
 
01:22:45.410 --> 01:22:45.420 align:start position:0%
um is anyone else I don't have any more
 
01:22:47.930 --> 01:22:47.940 align:start position:0%
cards on SB 170 does anyone else wish to
 
01:22:49.430 --> 01:22:49.440 align:start position:0%
speak anyone present wish to speak to SP
 
01:22:51.950 --> 01:22:51.960 align:start position:0%
170 anyone have any other questions we
 
01:22:53.030 --> 01:22:53.040 align:start position:0%
do have a work session so we have the
 
01:22:55.250 --> 01:22:55.260 align:start position:0%
opportunity to grab DHHS for the State
 
01:22:57.590 --> 01:22:57.600 align:start position:0%
Fire Marshal again shall you choose
 
01:22:59.030 --> 01:22:59.040 align:start position:0%
um all right hearing no up yes
 
01:23:00.590 --> 01:23:00.600 align:start position:0%
representative Nelson
 
01:23:02.390 --> 01:23:02.400 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I just have a
 
01:23:03.950 --> 01:23:03.960 align:start position:0%
question I'm not sure whom it would be
 
01:23:05.870 --> 01:23:05.880 align:start position:0%
directed towards but
 
01:23:08.510 --> 01:23:08.520 align:start position:0%
um if somebody could speak to the
 
01:23:12.410 --> 01:23:12.420 align:start position:0%
potential impact of us not allowing
 
01:23:18.830 --> 01:23:18.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:20.630 --> 01:23:20.640 align:start position:0%
um let's grab that in the work session
 
01:23:22.250 --> 01:23:22.260 align:start position:0%
okay I think
 
01:23:24.830 --> 01:23:24.840 align:start position:0%
um okay um representative can you grab
 
01:23:28.310 --> 01:23:28.320 align:start position:0%
me that blue sheet for SB 170
 
01:23:30.770 --> 01:23:30.780 align:start position:0%
so I can formally close the double
 
01:23:34.910 --> 01:23:34.920 align:start position:0%
recessed hearing don't worry here
 
01:23:36.290 --> 01:23:36.300 align:start position:0%
we're operating like the scent doesn't
 
01:23:37.550 --> 01:23:37.560 align:start position:0%
it feel nice you know with the beautiful
 
01:23:38.990 --> 01:23:39.000 align:start position:0%
people on the other side of the wall you
 
01:23:41.450 --> 01:23:41.460 align:start position:0%
get to just open close move left right
 
01:23:43.790 --> 01:23:43.800 align:start position:0%
up down uh there was one person signed
 
01:23:46.010 --> 01:23:46.020 align:start position:0%
in in support not speaking uh with that
 
01:23:48.290 --> 01:23:48.300 align:start position:0%
I will close the public hearing on SB
 
01:23:50.810 --> 01:23:50.820 align:start position:0%
170 and I will resume the public hearing
 
01:23:55.250 --> 01:23:55.260 align:start position:0%
on SB 221 it has been introduced by the
 
01:23:57.169 --> 01:23:57.179 align:start position:0%
bill sponsor
 
01:23:57.179 --> 01:24:00.410 align:start position:0%
bill sponsor
um

01:24:00.410 --> 01:24:00.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:03.169 --> 01:24:03.179 align:start position:0%
um that wants to introduce that so we
 
01:24:05.030 --> 01:24:05.040 align:start position:0%
will hear from
 
01:24:08.330 --> 01:24:08.340 align:start position:0%
um next up will be Devin Quinn
 
01:24:10.250 --> 01:24:10.260 align:start position:0%
from Concord
 
01:24:12.229 --> 01:24:12.239 align:start position:0%
Devin Quinn are you still here oh there
 
01:24:13.370 --> 01:24:13.380 align:start position:0%
you are I apologize I didn't see you
 
01:24:14.810 --> 01:24:14.820 align:start position:0%
walking on the back
 
01:24:16.430 --> 01:24:16.440 align:start position:0%
welcome to the house special committee
 
01:24:19.189 --> 01:24:19.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:19.199 --> 01:24:32.630 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:24:32.630 --> 01:24:32.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:34.490 --> 01:24:34.500 align:start position:0%
sorry about that I'm Devin Quinn from
 
01:24:36.110 --> 01:24:36.120 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire women's Foundation
 
01:24:38.510 --> 01:24:38.520 align:start position:0%
um we supported SB 221 as it was written
 
01:24:39.950 --> 01:24:39.960 align:start position:0%
originally and we continued to support
 
01:24:42.290 --> 01:24:42.300 align:start position:0%
it now as a study committee
 
01:24:44.689 --> 01:24:44.699 align:start position:0%
um uh we are specifically interested of
 
01:24:46.669 --> 01:24:46.679 align:start position:0%
course in child care as a women's issue
 
01:24:49.669 --> 01:24:49.679 align:start position:0%
because uh women are more likely than uh
 
01:24:51.410 --> 01:24:51.420 align:start position:0%
women with children are more likely to
 
01:24:54.590 --> 01:24:54.600 align:start position:0%
leave the workforce or reduce hours than
 
01:24:57.350 --> 01:24:57.360 align:start position:0%
men or fathers and single women
 
01:24:59.990 --> 01:25:00.000 align:start position:0%
particularly have a harder time at their
 
01:25:03.830 --> 01:25:03.840 align:start position:0%
median income affording child care then
 
01:25:06.590 --> 01:25:06.600 align:start position:0%
married couples so for Access and
 
01:25:08.030 --> 01:25:08.040 align:start position:0%
affordability reasons we're interested
 
01:25:10.250 --> 01:25:10.260 align:start position:0%
in Child Care Solutions
 
01:25:11.930 --> 01:25:11.940 align:start position:0%
um but this committee certainly knows
 
01:25:14.750 --> 01:25:14.760 align:start position:0%
about a child care issue um and so this
 
01:25:16.610 --> 01:25:16.620 align:start position:0%
isn't a study committee on child care as
 
01:25:19.610 --> 01:25:19.620 align:start position:0%
an issue but on specific clever Creative
 
01:25:19.620 --> 01:25:20.830 align:start position:0%
an issue but on specific clever Creative
Solutions

01:25:20.830 --> 01:25:20.840 align:start position:0%
Solutions
 
01:25:23.270 --> 01:25:23.280 align:start position:0%
specifically Senator Apprentice
 
01:25:26.930 --> 01:25:26.940 align:start position:0%
mentioned lines 12 through 16.
 
01:25:29.209 --> 01:25:29.219 align:start position:0%
um for regulatory burdens licensing
 
01:25:30.770 --> 01:25:30.780 align:start position:0%
restrictions and the feasibility and
 
01:25:33.669 --> 01:25:33.679 align:start position:0%
costs of optional useful tax credits
 
01:25:36.530 --> 01:25:36.540 align:start position:0%
the women's Foundation we run a program
 
01:25:38.510 --> 01:25:38.520 align:start position:0%
called women run and it's the only
 
01:25:40.850 --> 01:25:40.860 align:start position:0%
non-partisan program training and
 
01:25:43.130 --> 01:25:43.140 align:start position:0%
encouraging women to run for office at
 
01:25:44.990 --> 01:25:45.000 align:start position:0%
the local level of state and so we get a
 
01:25:45.890 --> 01:25:45.900 align:start position:0%
lot of
 
01:25:48.050 --> 01:25:48.060 align:start position:0%
women who are Democrats Republicans
 
01:25:49.910 --> 01:25:49.920 align:start position:0%
Independents or not politically
 
01:25:51.470 --> 01:25:51.480 align:start position:0%
Affiliated at all who just want to serve
 
01:25:53.149 --> 01:25:53.159 align:start position:0%
their community and they're often the
 
01:25:54.890 --> 01:25:54.900 align:start position:0%
women who are closest to the issue of
 
01:25:57.410 --> 01:25:57.420 align:start position:0%
child care as people struggling to find
 
01:25:59.030 --> 01:25:59.040 align:start position:0%
Child Care themselves their friends
 
01:26:01.729 --> 01:26:01.739 align:start position:0%
their neighbors they intimately know the
 
01:26:04.430 --> 01:26:04.440 align:start position:0%
child care facilities in their area and
 
01:26:06.370 --> 01:26:06.380 align:start position:0%
they're looking for municipal
 
01:26:08.450 --> 01:26:08.460 align:start position:0%
solutions to the problem they're seeing
 
01:26:10.970 --> 01:26:10.980 align:start position:0%
in their community and so the original
 
01:26:13.970 --> 01:26:13.980 align:start position:0%
bill would have been an opportunity for
 
01:26:16.550 --> 01:26:16.560 align:start position:0%
uh women at the local level to be able
 
01:26:20.390 --> 01:26:20.400 align:start position:0%
to provide some type of solution knowing
 
01:26:22.010 --> 01:26:22.020 align:start position:0%
that this needs a little bit more study
 
01:26:23.870 --> 01:26:23.880 align:start position:0%
the women's Foundation is really
 
01:26:25.490 --> 01:26:25.500 align:start position:0%
supportive and wants to be as helpful as
 
01:26:28.310 --> 01:26:28.320 align:start position:0%
possible in whatever this committee
 
01:26:31.490 --> 01:26:31.500 align:start position:0%
would need in terms of data or you know
 
01:26:33.229 --> 01:26:33.239 align:start position:0%
an audit of certain towns or cities in
 
01:26:34.910 --> 01:26:34.920 align:start position:0%
order to get that information for you to
 
01:26:37.209 --> 01:26:37.219 align:start position:0%
consider it so we wanted to
 
01:26:39.649 --> 01:26:39.659 align:start position:0%
say our support for the committee and be
 
01:26:41.930 --> 01:26:41.940 align:start position:0%
as helpful as possible
 
01:26:44.090 --> 01:26:44.100 align:start position:0%
are we retaining questions sure are
 
01:26:45.890 --> 01:26:45.900 align:start position:0%
there questions from the committee
 
01:26:47.990 --> 01:26:48.000 align:start position:0%
saying none thank you so much
 
01:26:50.270 --> 01:26:50.280 align:start position:0%
um next up Jackie Cowell from Concord
 
01:26:53.090 --> 01:26:53.100 align:start position:0%
and early learning New Hampshire
 
01:26:55.129 --> 01:26:55.139 align:start position:0%
welcome back
 
01:26:57.470 --> 01:26:57.480 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and hi again I'm
 
01:26:58.970 --> 01:26:58.980 align:start position:0%
Jackie Cowell from Early Learning New
 
01:27:01.850 --> 01:27:01.860 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and I simply support sb221 as
 
01:27:04.490 --> 01:27:04.500 align:start position:0%
a study committee and again
 
01:27:06.530 --> 01:27:06.540 align:start position:0%
um I'm glad it's around affordability
 
01:27:09.110 --> 01:27:09.120 align:start position:0%
accessibility I'm hoping Workforce which
 
01:27:11.090 --> 01:27:11.100 align:start position:0%
is the number one thing affecting
 
01:27:12.830 --> 01:27:12.840 align:start position:0%
affordability and accessibility right
 
01:27:15.229 --> 01:27:15.239 align:start position:0%
now is part of it the other thing I
 
01:27:17.209 --> 01:27:17.219 align:start position:0%
would suggest is adding the
 
01:27:19.189 --> 01:27:19.199 align:start position:0%
legislatively enacted New Hampshire
 
01:27:22.510 --> 01:27:22.520 align:start position:0%
Child Care advisory Council to the list
 
01:27:25.129 --> 01:27:25.139 align:start position:0%
and perhaps some other providers as well
 
01:27:26.870 --> 01:27:26.880 align:start position:0%
I'm sure the committee will bring folks
 
01:27:28.510 --> 01:27:28.520 align:start position:0%
in but that I think would be a good

and thank you chair and thank you
 
01:28:09.950 --> 01:28:09.960 align:start position:0%
members of the committee my name is
 
01:28:12.169 --> 01:28:12.179 align:start position:0%
Amanda Sears I'm the director of the
 
01:28:13.790 --> 01:28:13.800 align:start position:0%
campaign for family-friendly economy
 
01:28:15.649 --> 01:28:15.659 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire
 
01:28:17.570 --> 01:28:17.580 align:start position:0%
um I wanted to speak in support of this
 
01:28:19.669 --> 01:28:19.679 align:start position:0%
bill I do think you know at some level
 
01:28:21.950 --> 01:28:21.960 align:start position:0%
the creation of this committee
 
01:28:24.050 --> 01:28:24.060 align:start position:0%
um is to do the same thing that this
 
01:28:26.510 --> 01:28:26.520 align:start position:0%
bill seeks to do what is different is it
 
01:28:28.430 --> 01:28:28.440 align:start position:0%
adds a senator so it creates another
 
01:28:30.770 --> 01:28:30.780 align:start position:0%
body where the Senate is also working to
 
01:28:33.290 --> 01:28:33.300 align:start position:0%
think about Creative Solutions I mean I
 
01:28:34.070 --> 01:28:34.080 align:start position:0%
know that it would be a different
 
01:28:35.870 --> 01:28:35.880 align:start position:0%
different body so I'm not saying just as
 
01:28:39.050 --> 01:28:39.060 align:start position:0%
a senator um but it would be another way
 
01:28:42.590 --> 01:28:42.600 align:start position:0%
for this for you know members of the
 
01:28:44.629 --> 01:28:44.639 align:start position:0%
State House of Representatives to work
 
01:28:46.550 --> 01:28:46.560 align:start position:0%
together with the Senate to create
 
01:28:49.370 --> 01:28:49.380 align:start position:0%
buy-in on legislative policy moving
 
01:28:52.270 --> 01:28:52.280 align:start position:0%
forward to address the child care crisis
 
01:28:54.470 --> 01:28:54.480 align:start position:0%
just I don't want to I know you've all
 
01:28:56.090 --> 01:28:56.100 align:start position:0%
been learning a lot about what's what's
 
01:28:59.629 --> 01:28:59.639 align:start position:0%
address what's feeding into this but
 
01:29:02.209 --> 01:29:02.219 align:start position:0%
availability affordability and
 
01:29:04.310 --> 01:29:04.320 align:start position:0%
sustainability are the big pillars of
 
01:29:06.470 --> 01:29:06.480 align:start position:0%
what we're trying to address here
 
01:29:09.110 --> 01:29:09.120 align:start position:0%
um and particularly the workforce crisis
 
01:29:12.050 --> 01:29:12.060 align:start position:0%
just I wanted to add one little tidbit
 
01:29:13.970 --> 01:29:13.980 align:start position:0%
of information because I think that what
 
01:29:16.010 --> 01:29:16.020 align:start position:0%
elevates this from
 
01:29:18.770 --> 01:29:18.780 align:start position:0%
um you know at the uh budget hearings I
 
01:29:20.629 --> 01:29:20.639 align:start position:0%
was here for the Senate and the house
 
01:29:22.430 --> 01:29:22.440 align:start position:0%
I've heard so much about the workforce
 
01:29:23.990 --> 01:29:24.000 align:start position:0%
crisis and I think everywhere you go
 
01:29:26.810 --> 01:29:26.820 align:start position:0%
that's what you'll hear in New Hampshire
 
01:29:30.050 --> 01:29:30.060 align:start position:0%
uh the women's Workforce participation
 
01:29:32.689 --> 01:29:32.699 align:start position:0%
has taken a huge hit since the pandemic
 
01:29:35.570 --> 01:29:35.580 align:start position:0%
a 3.2 percent drop in women's labor
 
01:29:38.510 --> 01:29:38.520 align:start position:0%
force participation since 2019 which is
 
01:29:41.209 --> 01:29:41.219 align:start position:0%
enormous in terms of the amount of
 
01:29:44.330 --> 01:29:44.340 align:start position:0%
that's about about 19 000 women who are
 
01:29:46.010 --> 01:29:46.020 align:start position:0%
not in the workforce compared to who
 
01:29:48.830 --> 01:29:48.840 align:start position:0%
were in the workforce in 2019 and for
 
01:29:52.250 --> 01:29:52.260 align:start position:0%
every sector of the economy that is uh
 
01:29:54.649 --> 01:29:54.659 align:start position:0%
desperate for people to be working for
 
01:29:57.229 --> 01:29:57.239 align:start position:0%
them those 19 000 women who are no
 
01:29:58.550 --> 01:29:58.560 align:start position:0%
longer participating in the economy
 
01:30:01.010 --> 01:30:01.020 align:start position:0%
would really help and so I just wanted
 
01:30:02.750 --> 01:30:02.760 align:start position:0%
to take that add that into the
 
01:30:04.970 --> 01:30:04.980 align:start position:0%
conversation that not only is the child
 
01:30:07.189 --> 01:30:07.199 align:start position:0%
care Workforce struggling but so was the
 
01:30:08.510 --> 01:30:08.520 align:start position:0%
rest of the country the state's
 
01:30:11.390 --> 01:30:11.400 align:start position:0%
Workforce and that elevating the issue
 
01:30:13.250 --> 01:30:13.260 align:start position:0%
of child care for Solutions is a really
 
01:30:15.169 --> 01:30:15.179 align:start position:0%
important piece of that thank you
 
01:30:16.910 --> 01:30:16.920 align:start position:0%
will you be taking questions of course
 
01:30:18.590 --> 01:30:18.600 align:start position:0%
are there questions from the committee
 
01:30:21.350 --> 01:30:21.360 align:start position:0%
representative McWilliams
 
01:30:22.850 --> 01:30:22.860 align:start position:0%
committing an email and some of that
 
01:30:24.290 --> 01:30:24.300 align:start position:0%
data that you just shared I think that
 
01:30:25.790 --> 01:30:25.800 align:start position:0%
would be really helpful for us moving
 
01:30:27.649 --> 01:30:27.659 align:start position:0%
forward sure of course thank you further
 
01:30:27.659 --> 01:30:28.610 align:start position:0%
forward sure of course thank you further
questions

01:30:28.610 --> 01:30:28.620 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:30:30.470 --> 01:30:30.480 align:start position:0%

01:30:32.209 --> 01:30:32.219 align:start position:0%

foreign

01:30:50.390 --> 01:30:50.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:52.610 --> 01:30:52.620 align:start position:0%
no one was signed up uh who did not
 
01:30:54.709 --> 01:30:54.719 align:start position:0%

bill

01:30:55.669 --> 01:30:55.679 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:30:56.930 --> 01:30:56.940 align:start position:0%
um with that I will be closing the
 
01:30:58.910 --> 01:30:58.920 align:start position:0%
public hearing on Senate Bill 221 and I
 
01:31:02.149 --> 01:31:02.159 align:start position:0%
will be reopening our work session so
 
01:31:03.470 --> 01:31:03.480 align:start position:0%
work session
 
01:31:07.729 --> 01:31:07.739 align:start position:0%
let me kind of give where an overview of
 
01:31:10.070 --> 01:31:10.080 align:start position:0%
where we're at uh where we're going so
 
01:31:11.270 --> 01:31:11.280 align:start position:0%
obviously the committee gets determined
 
01:31:13.010 --> 01:31:13.020 align:start position:0%
kind of where we're going uh and what we
 
01:31:15.169 --> 01:31:15.179 align:start position:0%
have in front of us
 
01:31:15.179 --> 01:31:16.370 align:start position:0%
have in front of us
um

01:31:16.370 --> 01:31:16.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:31:18.830 --> 01:31:18.840 align:start position:0%
we're gonna meet at least one more time
 
01:31:20.270 --> 01:31:20.280 align:start position:0%
um obviously I just noticed that by the
 
01:31:21.410 --> 01:31:21.420 align:start position:0%
way that's why I was being so rude to
 
01:31:23.209 --> 01:31:23.219 align:start position:0%
the presenter um I was noticing our
 
01:31:25.850 --> 01:31:25.860 align:start position:0%
executive session so I apologize to the
 
01:31:28.189 --> 01:31:28.199 align:start position:0%
um to the testifier on that but we will
 
01:31:29.990 --> 01:31:30.000 align:start position:0%
meeting next week at 10 A.M we'll have a
 
01:31:31.910 --> 01:31:31.920 align:start position:0%
10 a.m uh noticed work session and then
 
01:31:33.470 --> 01:31:33.480 align:start position:0%
we'll start executing bills at 10 15.
 
01:31:34.790 --> 01:31:34.800 align:start position:0%
obviously we can roll that exact back
 
01:31:37.010 --> 01:31:37.020 align:start position:0%
that gives us at least 15 minutes where
 
01:31:37.910 --> 01:31:37.920 align:start position:0%
we're going to have to talk to each
 
01:31:37.920 --> 01:31:38.990 align:start position:0%
we're going to have to talk to each
other

01:31:38.990 --> 01:31:39.000 align:start position:0%
other
 
01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:39.770 align:start position:0%
other
um

01:31:39.770 --> 01:31:39.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:31:39.780 --> 01:31:41.149 align:start position:0%
um
so

01:31:41.149 --> 01:31:41.159 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:31:43.490 --> 01:31:43.500 align:start position:0%
um the way I look at the world as of
 
01:31:45.229 --> 01:31:45.239 align:start position:0%
today as we've had I believe we've met
 
01:31:46.610 --> 01:31:46.620 align:start position:0%
three or four times
 
01:31:48.290 --> 01:31:48.300 align:start position:0%
um we're gonna do one more session in
 
01:31:49.490 --> 01:31:49.500 align:start position:0%
the field most likely in Greater
 
01:31:49.500 --> 01:31:50.450 align:start position:0%
the field most likely in Greater
Manchester

01:31:50.450 --> 01:31:50.460 align:start position:0%
Manchester
 
01:31:52.790 --> 01:31:52.800 align:start position:0%
um I know that uh big thanks to
 
01:31:54.530 --> 01:31:54.540 align:start position:0%
representative Paige for shooting us up
 
01:31:57.649 --> 01:31:57.659 align:start position:0%
to Conway um it would be wrong to not do
 
01:31:58.970 --> 01:31:58.980 align:start position:0%
one at least in the Southern Tier I'm
 
01:32:00.950 --> 01:32:00.960 align:start position:0%
trying to push for a third one but
 
01:32:02.570 --> 01:32:02.580 align:start position:0%
sometimes I get some some negative
 
01:32:04.790 --> 01:32:04.800 align:start position:0%
negative pushback when I try to do
 
01:32:06.649 --> 01:32:06.659 align:start position:0%
things not in Concord but it's okay
 
01:32:09.470 --> 01:32:09.480 align:start position:0%
um so I am working on um a space for us
 
01:32:11.390 --> 01:32:11.400 align:start position:0%
to meet probably in June uh in Greater
 
01:32:12.830 --> 01:32:12.840 align:start position:0%
man in Manchester or greater Manchester
 
01:32:14.750 --> 01:32:14.760 align:start position:0%
or somewhere in there and I'm if I do
 
01:32:15.950 --> 01:32:15.960 align:start position:0%
one more it'll probably be either the
 
01:32:17.870 --> 01:32:17.880 align:start position:0%
Seacoast or Cheshire county Sullivan
 
01:32:19.310 --> 01:32:19.320 align:start position:0%
County that area
 
01:32:20.990 --> 01:32:21.000 align:start position:0%
um so if you have somebody that wants to
 
01:32:22.669 --> 01:32:22.679 align:start position:0%
spearhead uh Cheshire county or the
 
01:32:24.830 --> 01:32:24.840 align:start position:0%
Seacoast I know those are two vastly
 
01:32:26.270 --> 01:32:26.280 align:start position:0%
different things um but if you have
 
01:32:27.530 --> 01:32:27.540 align:start position:0%
somebody that wishes to spearhead that
 
01:32:29.209 --> 01:32:29.219 align:start position:0%
please let me know um because it's just
 
01:32:31.610 --> 01:32:31.620 align:start position:0%
one less thing that I have to do
 
01:32:31.620 --> 01:32:32.270 align:start position:0%
one less thing that I have to do
um

01:32:32.270 --> 01:32:32.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:32:34.610 --> 01:32:34.620 align:start position:0%
I I will take care of Manchester
 
01:32:37.970 --> 01:32:37.980 align:start position:0%
um because that's where I live
 
01:32:37.980 --> 01:32:40.070 align:start position:0%
um because that's where I live
um

01:32:40.070 --> 01:32:40.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:32:42.110 --> 01:32:42.120 align:start position:0%
that would be wonderful if you could yep
 
01:32:43.790 --> 01:32:43.800 align:start position:0%
um if you absolutely could that would be
 
01:32:45.290 --> 01:32:45.300 align:start position:0%
great thank you
 
01:32:45.300 --> 01:32:46.250 align:start position:0%
great thank you
um

01:32:46.250 --> 01:32:46.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:32:48.530 --> 01:32:48.540 align:start position:0%
the way I see the bills we have in front
 
01:32:49.310 --> 01:32:49.320 align:start position:0%
of us
 
01:32:52.070 --> 01:32:52.080 align:start position:0%
um so we have this one from DHHS which I
 
01:32:53.090 --> 01:32:53.100 align:start position:0%
think we'll discuss here in this work
 
01:32:54.410 --> 01:32:54.420 align:start position:0%
session with these changes that they've
 
01:32:57.890 --> 01:32:57.900 align:start position:0%
made we have the
 
01:33:01.970 --> 01:33:01.980 align:start position:0%
um we have SB 170 which I think we have
 
01:33:04.669 --> 01:33:04.679 align:start position:0%
some let's call it issues we have to
 
01:33:05.870 --> 01:33:05.880 align:start position:0%
work out with with the grandfather in
 
01:33:05.880 --> 01:33:07.189 align:start position:0%
work out with with the grandfather in
claws

01:33:07.189 --> 01:33:07.199 align:start position:0%
claws
 
01:33:11.330 --> 01:33:11.340 align:start position:0%
um and then we have SB 221 which is a
 
01:33:14.090 --> 01:33:14.100 align:start position:0%
study committee so I will kind of do the
 
01:33:15.410 --> 01:33:15.420 align:start position:0%
opening Salvo on what I think is the
 
01:33:17.870 --> 01:33:17.880 align:start position:0%
easy one which is the study committee
 
01:33:19.970 --> 01:33:19.980 align:start position:0%
um I I will not be supporting the study
 
01:33:19.980 --> 01:33:20.990 align:start position:0%
um I I will not be supporting the study
committee

01:33:20.990 --> 01:33:21.000 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:33:22.070 --> 01:33:22.080 align:start position:0%
um not because I don't believe the
 
01:33:23.510 --> 01:33:23.520 align:start position:0%
things in their value
 
01:33:25.129 --> 01:33:25.139 align:start position:0%
um just because I believe that this I
 
01:33:26.629 --> 01:33:26.639 align:start position:0%
believe this special committee is
 
01:33:28.490 --> 01:33:28.500 align:start position:0%
accomplishing those goals
 
01:33:30.950 --> 01:33:30.960 align:start position:0%
um so and that's not a attack on the
 
01:33:32.090 --> 01:33:32.100 align:start position:0%
sponsors it's not attack on their
 
01:33:33.110 --> 01:33:33.120 align:start position:0%
intentions I think it was well
 
01:33:34.850 --> 01:33:34.860 align:start position:0%
intentioned it was introduced obviously
 
01:33:36.470 --> 01:33:36.480 align:start position:0%
before the sub this special committee
 
01:33:38.330 --> 01:33:38.340 align:start position:0%
was formed um so it wasn't like they
 
01:33:39.709 --> 01:33:39.719 align:start position:0%
were trying to usurp us or any of that
 
01:33:42.169 --> 01:33:42.179 align:start position:0%
sort of stuff but I do view it as an
 
01:33:44.930 --> 01:33:44.940 align:start position:0%
opportunity as I kind of said in our the
 
01:33:46.250 --> 01:33:46.260 align:start position:0%
work section that I opened and closed
 
01:33:48.470 --> 01:33:48.480 align:start position:0%
which is we have a bill that I believe
 
01:33:51.229 --> 01:33:51.239 align:start position:0%
is at this point unnecessary
 
01:33:52.910 --> 01:33:52.920 align:start position:0%
um and if we do have something that we
 
01:33:54.290 --> 01:33:54.300 align:start position:0%
have heard from him in a listening
 
01:33:55.790 --> 01:33:55.800 align:start position:0%
session or our two or three meetings
 
01:33:57.470 --> 01:33:57.480 align:start position:0%
that we wish to introduce we have a
 
01:33:59.390 --> 01:33:59.400 align:start position:0%
vehicle that we can do it um it would be
 
01:34:00.950 --> 01:34:00.960 align:start position:0%
a non-germaine Amendment obviously but
 
01:34:02.390 --> 01:34:02.400 align:start position:0%
at least it'd be relative to child care
 
01:34:04.550 --> 01:34:04.560 align:start position:0%
so I view that bill
 
01:34:07.610 --> 01:34:07.620 align:start position:0%
um I view that I view SB 221 as that as
 
01:34:09.770 --> 01:34:09.780 align:start position:0%
our opportunity to do something
 
01:34:11.270 --> 01:34:11.280 align:start position:0%
um if we so discover in this next work
 
01:34:13.209 --> 01:34:13.219 align:start position:0%
session to do something to that bill
 
01:34:15.530 --> 01:34:15.540 align:start position:0%
originally it was my intention to do
 
01:34:17.390 --> 01:34:17.400 align:start position:0%
that to 170 because I thought that that
 
01:34:18.530 --> 01:34:18.540 align:start position:0%
was going to be a little more of a
 
01:34:20.270 --> 01:34:20.280 align:start position:0%
consensus but it was like with anything
 
01:34:21.830 --> 01:34:21.840 align:start position:0%
the more you started to pull on it the
 
01:34:22.970 --> 01:34:22.980 align:start position:0%
more you started realizing that's not
 
01:34:24.709 --> 01:34:24.719 align:start position:0%
the bill to go touch
 
01:34:26.810 --> 01:34:26.820 align:start position:0%
um and the good news is SB 221 land in
 
01:34:29.330 --> 01:34:29.340 align:start position:0%
their lab so that's kind of the world as
 
01:34:31.310 --> 01:34:31.320 align:start position:0%
I see it right now with our legislation
 
01:34:32.810 --> 01:34:32.820 align:start position:0%
in front of us
 
01:34:35.510 --> 01:34:35.520 align:start position:0%
um the upcoming meetings that we'll
 
01:34:36.830 --> 01:34:36.840 align:start position:0%
actually have in Concord we're going to
 
01:34:40.970 --> 01:34:40.980 align:start position:0%
do one on the quality Care Program
 
01:34:42.770 --> 01:34:42.780 align:start position:0%
um I'm I believe I've released research
 
01:34:45.830 --> 01:34:45.840 align:start position:0%
documents to the committee in regards to
 
01:34:48.430 --> 01:34:48.440 align:start position:0%
that we did hear about that in the
 
01:34:51.530 --> 01:34:51.540 align:start position:0%
listening session in North Conway I
 
01:34:53.149 --> 01:34:53.159 align:start position:0%
think there's opportunity there but
 
01:34:54.470 --> 01:34:54.480 align:start position:0%
there's going to be ruffled feathers
 
01:34:54.480 --> 01:34:55.430 align:start position:0%
there's going to be ruffled feathers
there

01:34:55.430 --> 01:34:55.440 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:34:57.770 --> 01:34:57.780 align:start position:0%
um but I do recommend that you read the
 
01:34:59.030 --> 01:34:59.040 align:start position:0%
I believe we I believe our committee
 
01:35:01.669 --> 01:35:01.679 align:start position:0%
researcher released I want to say five
 
01:35:03.350 --> 01:35:03.360 align:start position:0%
or six research documents that I asked
 
01:35:05.750 --> 01:35:05.760 align:start position:0%
her to compose one of which was about
 
01:35:09.110 --> 01:35:09.120 align:start position:0%
that program another thing to convey to
 
01:35:10.790 --> 01:35:10.800 align:start position:0%
the committee which I know we have heard
 
01:35:14.750 --> 01:35:14.760 align:start position:0%
about is the child care scholarship and
 
01:35:16.910 --> 01:35:16.920 align:start position:0%
the change that I went in so DHHS put in
 
01:35:20.090 --> 01:35:20.100 align:start position:0%
a budget request to move to the
 
01:35:22.490 --> 01:35:22.500 align:start position:0%
enrollment based system there was a
 
01:35:24.649 --> 01:35:24.659 align:start position:0%
legislative bill in the Senate I believe
 
01:35:28.010 --> 01:35:28.020 align:start position:0%
it was 237 227.
 
01:35:29.810 --> 01:35:29.820 align:start position:0%
um the Senate has the sentence in
 
01:35:31.090 --> 01:35:31.100 align:start position:0%
possession that we're not getting that
 
01:35:34.189 --> 01:35:34.199 align:start position:0%
but it is I did explore that because
 
01:35:36.229 --> 01:35:36.239 align:start position:0%
that was a legislative action to try to
 
01:35:38.270 --> 01:35:38.280 align:start position:0%
get to the enrollment based model and
 
01:35:40.550 --> 01:35:40.560 align:start position:0%
DHHS filed a budgetary action to get to
 
01:35:42.530 --> 01:35:42.540 align:start position:0%
that so I did have in the documents that
 
01:35:44.030 --> 01:35:44.040 align:start position:0%
released you to check to make sure that
 
01:35:46.850 --> 01:35:46.860 align:start position:0%
dhh just can do that with a jowcar
 
01:35:51.050 --> 01:35:51.060 align:start position:0%
change and it appears so so that is kind
 
01:35:52.910 --> 01:35:52.920 align:start position:0%
of the the good news is we don't have to
 
01:35:54.950 --> 01:35:54.960 align:start position:0%
vote on that um our friends in jail car
 
01:35:56.090 --> 01:35:56.100 align:start position:0%
are going to get to vote on that and our
 
01:35:58.010 --> 01:35:58.020 align:start position:0%
friends in the budget which I somehow
 
01:35:59.090 --> 01:35:59.100 align:start position:0%
get the feeling that representative
 
01:36:02.689 --> 01:36:02.699 align:start position:0%
walner may have had a hand in that uh
 
01:36:04.129 --> 01:36:04.139 align:start position:0%
say nothing
 
01:36:04.139 --> 01:36:04.850 align:start position:0%
say nothing
um

01:36:04.850 --> 01:36:04.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:36:07.370 --> 01:36:07.380 align:start position:0%
but um so that's I guess a good news
 
01:36:09.830 --> 01:36:09.840 align:start position:0%
there is that we won't have to touch
 
01:36:12.290 --> 01:36:12.300 align:start position:0%
that in this committee I believe it was
 
01:36:13.970 --> 01:36:13.980 align:start position:0%
uh I want to say it was it represented
 
01:36:15.830 --> 01:36:15.840 align:start position:0%
water was a 10 expansion was it going
 
01:36:17.930 --> 01:36:17.940 align:start position:0%
from 75 to 85 percent and then moving to
 
01:36:19.129 --> 01:36:19.139 align:start position:0%
the enrollment model it was both of
 
01:36:20.330 --> 01:36:20.340 align:start position:0%
those or was it just the moving to the
 
01:36:26.330 --> 01:36:26.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:26.340 --> 01:36:27.470 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:36:27.470 --> 01:36:27.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:36:28.910 --> 01:36:28.920 align:start position:0%
you can't print your microphone on first
 
01:36:32.090 --> 01:36:32.100 align:start position:0%
person the enrollment piece which the
 
01:36:34.250 --> 01:36:34.260 align:start position:0%
um pay by enrollment which the
 
01:36:36.950 --> 01:36:36.960 align:start position:0%
department had in their budget uh
 
01:36:39.290 --> 01:36:39.300 align:start position:0%
raising the eligibility for family
 
01:36:43.010 --> 01:36:43.020 align:start position:0%
assistance from for a scholarship for um
 
01:36:45.050 --> 01:36:45.060 align:start position:0%
from the present level which I can't
 
01:36:47.330 --> 01:36:47.340 align:start position:0%
even remember what it is up to 85
 
01:36:49.450 --> 01:36:49.460 align:start position:0%
percent of median income
 
01:36:54.229 --> 01:36:54.239 align:start position:0%
and the other is to pay providers at the
 
01:36:58.189 --> 01:36:58.199 align:start position:0%
75th percentile of the market rate or of
 
01:37:01.790 --> 01:37:01.800 align:start position:0%
a cost analysis which would be done by
 
01:37:03.350 --> 01:37:03.360 align:start position:0%
the department yes
 
01:37:06.050 --> 01:37:06.060 align:start position:0%
so as you can imagine as somebody who is
 
01:37:07.669 --> 01:37:07.679 align:start position:0%
business accepts that scholarship I was
 
01:37:08.990 --> 01:37:09.000 align:start position:0%
super excited not to have to sign a
 
01:37:10.250 --> 01:37:10.260 align:start position:0%
conflict of interest paperwork on that
 
01:37:10.260 --> 01:37:11.870 align:start position:0%
conflict of interest paperwork on that
so

01:37:11.870 --> 01:37:11.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:37:11.880 --> 01:37:12.890 align:start position:0%
so
um

01:37:12.890 --> 01:37:12.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:37:15.290 --> 01:37:15.300 align:start position:0%
so that's kind of um that's kind of a
 
01:37:17.030 --> 01:37:17.040 align:start position:0%
big check mark right there
 
01:37:20.209 --> 01:37:20.219 align:start position:0%
um that um that my largest concern to
 
01:37:21.770 --> 01:37:21.780 align:start position:0%
the Committees I did spend a significant
 
01:37:23.810 --> 01:37:23.820 align:start position:0%
period of time making sure that because
 
01:37:25.850 --> 01:37:25.860 align:start position:0%
I was a little bit confused because the
 
01:37:28.370 --> 01:37:28.380 align:start position:0%
Senate was taking legislative acts in
 
01:37:29.570 --> 01:37:29.580 align:start position:0%
um and then when you go and you read the
 
01:37:32.090 --> 01:37:32.100 align:start position:0%
actual statute that governs that program
 
01:37:35.510 --> 01:37:35.520 align:start position:0%
it's actually a very wide gives DHS a
 
01:37:37.189 --> 01:37:37.199 align:start position:0%
very wide
 
01:37:39.169 --> 01:37:39.179 align:start position:0%
um uh
 
01:37:40.790 --> 01:37:40.800 align:start position:0%
latitude to conduct that program
 
01:37:42.350 --> 01:37:42.360 align:start position:0%
basically the language says the
 
01:37:44.270 --> 01:37:44.280 align:start position:0%
department will conduct a program to the
 
01:37:46.669 --> 01:37:46.679 align:start position:0%
benefit of child care the child care
 
01:37:47.570 --> 01:37:47.580 align:start position:0%
system in the state of New Hampshire
 
01:37:49.010 --> 01:37:49.020 align:start position:0%
that's effectively what it says it's
 
01:37:52.189 --> 01:37:52.199 align:start position:0%
it's very open-ended so um you know um
 
01:37:53.870 --> 01:37:53.880 align:start position:0%
good news if you wanted that change bad
 
01:37:55.310 --> 01:37:55.320 align:start position:0%
news if you don't like open-ended
 
01:37:57.830 --> 01:37:57.840 align:start position:0%
bureaucracy uh either way it's getting
 
01:38:00.290 --> 01:38:00.300 align:start position:0%
changed uh assuming job car passes it
 
01:38:02.330 --> 01:38:02.340 align:start position:0%
and the budget doesn't pass and the
 
01:38:04.189 --> 01:38:04.199 align:start position:0%
budget passes and then job car passes it
 
01:38:05.209 --> 01:38:05.219 align:start position:0%
so I guess you know we're going to have
 
01:38:07.850 --> 01:38:07.860 align:start position:0%
to pass a budget um
 
01:38:10.250 --> 01:38:10.260 align:start position:0%
um so uh good news on that front anyways
 
01:38:12.229 --> 01:38:12.239 align:start position:0%
um in that case I want to open it up to
 
01:38:13.550 --> 01:38:13.560 align:start position:0%
the first thing I do is let's kind of
 
01:38:14.930 --> 01:38:14.940 align:start position:0%
knock out the things that I've talked
 
01:38:16.850 --> 01:38:16.860 align:start position:0%
about here in sequential order
 
01:38:16.860 --> 01:38:17.810 align:start position:0%
about here in sequential order
um

01:38:17.810 --> 01:38:17.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:38:19.850 --> 01:38:19.860 align:start position:0%
assuming we find something in our
 
01:38:20.990 --> 01:38:21.000 align:start position:0%
conversation that's about to take place
 
01:38:22.750 --> 01:38:22.760 align:start position:0%
uh is anybody
 
01:38:26.090 --> 01:38:26.100 align:start position:0%
really opposed to that change if we even
 
01:38:28.550 --> 01:38:28.560 align:start position:0%
find a change that change being put onto
 
01:38:30.530 --> 01:38:30.540 align:start position:0%
a replace all with sp221 is anyone is
 
01:38:32.450 --> 01:38:32.460 align:start position:0%
anyone opposed to that off the bat or is
 
01:38:34.970 --> 01:38:34.980 align:start position:0%
that just uh it's obviously not a
 
01:38:36.770 --> 01:38:36.780 align:start position:0%
dictatorship so I have to if we do find
 
01:38:39.890 --> 01:38:39.900 align:start position:0%
a change we would do it to 221.
 
01:38:42.950 --> 01:38:42.960 align:start position:0%
uh yes representative climbs
 
01:38:42.960 --> 01:38:43.850 align:start position:0%
uh yes representative climbs
um

01:38:43.850 --> 01:38:43.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:38:46.189 --> 01:38:46.199 align:start position:0%
I meant that I find
 
01:38:49.669 --> 01:38:49.679 align:start position:0%
a very creative solution here in 221 and
 
01:38:52.070 --> 01:38:52.080 align:start position:0%
I think it's worthy of this group kind
 
01:38:55.370 --> 01:38:55.380 align:start position:0%
of taking that on as one of our tasks to
 
01:38:57.050 --> 01:38:57.060 align:start position:0%
do these hearings
 
01:39:00.050 --> 01:39:00.060 align:start position:0%
um specifically regarding the municipal
 
01:39:02.689 --> 01:39:02.699 align:start position:0%
property tax exemption so I would like
 
01:39:04.669 --> 01:39:04.679 align:start position:0%
to actually notice and have some kind of
 
01:39:06.410 --> 01:39:06.420 align:start position:0%
a listening session as a committee on
 
01:39:08.090 --> 01:39:08.100 align:start position:0%
that specifically and commit to doing
 
01:39:10.129 --> 01:39:10.139 align:start position:0%
that if we're going to use this as our
 
01:39:12.290 --> 01:39:12.300 align:start position:0%
placeholder Bill to do other things with
 
01:39:14.149 --> 01:39:14.159 align:start position:0%
uh you have my you have my firm
 
01:39:17.570 --> 01:39:17.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:19.550 --> 01:39:19.560 align:start position:0%
um any other comments to that that idea
 
01:39:20.990 --> 01:39:21.000 align:start position:0%
if nobody objects to it I'm going to
 
01:39:22.970 --> 01:39:22.980 align:start position:0%
assume it's it's an okay idea and I
 
01:39:24.830 --> 01:39:24.840 align:start position:0%
won't they won't sharpen the pitchforks
 
01:39:26.570 --> 01:39:26.580 align:start position:0%
and light the torches on me uh
 
01:39:28.910 --> 01:39:28.920 align:start position:0%
representative page I I agree that it's
 
01:39:30.169 --> 01:39:30.179 align:start position:0%
the better vehicle if there's something
 
01:39:32.270 --> 01:39:32.280 align:start position:0%
we want to do this year
 
01:39:34.790 --> 01:39:34.800 align:start position:0%
um partly because I really support 170
 
01:39:36.950 --> 01:39:36.960 align:start position:0%
and I want to keep it clean yeah
 
01:39:38.629 --> 01:39:38.639 align:start position:0%
um and I
 
01:39:41.270 --> 01:39:41.280 align:start position:0%
second representative McWilliams on on
 
01:39:42.770 --> 01:39:42.780 align:start position:0%
the um
 
01:39:46.790 --> 01:39:46.800 align:start position:0%
Municipal property tax exemption piece
 
01:39:49.010 --> 01:39:49.020 align:start position:0%
um and seeing if we as a committee can
 
01:39:51.050 --> 01:39:51.060 align:start position:0%
can investigate that more seriously and
 
01:39:52.550 --> 01:39:52.560 align:start position:0%
I would love if we could get minutes
 
01:39:53.990 --> 01:39:54.000 align:start position:0%
from that Senate conversation it sounds
 
01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:54.830 align:start position:0%
from that Senate conversation it sounds
like

01:39:54.830 --> 01:39:54.840 align:start position:0%
like
 
01:39:54.840 --> 01:39:56.209 align:start position:0%
like
the

01:39:56.209 --> 01:39:56.219 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:39:59.390 --> 01:39:59.400 align:start position:0%
um the um there were some very specific
 
01:40:01.850 --> 01:40:01.860 align:start position:0%
questions and concerns which seemed very
 
01:40:03.649 --> 01:40:03.659 align:start position:0%
easy to chase down answers to if they
 
01:40:05.149 --> 01:40:05.159 align:start position:0%
are limited to what was what was
 
01:40:08.149 --> 01:40:08.159 align:start position:0%
presented in testimony so I'd love to to
 
01:40:09.290 --> 01:40:09.300 align:start position:0%
dig in
 
01:40:09.300 --> 01:40:10.610 align:start position:0%
dig in
okay

01:40:10.610 --> 01:40:10.620 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:40:12.649 --> 01:40:12.659 align:start position:0%
um any other just this kind of like this
 
01:40:13.850 --> 01:40:13.860 align:start position:0%
is the easy one right so I'll get the
 
01:40:15.470 --> 01:40:15.480 align:start position:0%
before is everybody going to that lunch
 
01:40:16.729 --> 01:40:16.739 align:start position:0%
by the way you know you get some it's a
 
01:40:18.050 --> 01:40:18.060 align:start position:0%
freelance overdose Steakhouse I hear
 
01:40:19.790 --> 01:40:19.800 align:start position:0%
steak tips can be very nice
 
01:40:21.050 --> 01:40:21.060 align:start position:0%
um all right so we're all we're all
 
01:40:22.729 --> 01:40:22.739 align:start position:0%
we're all on board with that right we're
 
01:40:24.590 --> 01:40:24.600 align:start position:0%
all good with that I'm not gonna it's
 
01:40:26.090 --> 01:40:26.100 align:start position:0%
not gonna be like a mob waiting for me
 
01:40:27.890 --> 01:40:27.900 align:start position:0%
okay all right so we'll we'll put that
 
01:40:28.910 --> 01:40:28.920 align:start position:0%
one aside
 
01:40:28.920 --> 01:40:31.030 align:start position:0%
one aside
um

01:40:31.030 --> 01:40:31.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:40:34.370 --> 01:40:34.380 align:start position:0%
let's say let's just save the the worst
 
01:40:36.169 --> 01:40:36.179 align:start position:0%
one for last I think um let's just go
 
01:40:37.250 --> 01:40:37.260 align:start position:0%
right into
 
01:40:41.270 --> 01:40:41.280 align:start position:0%
um uh not 170 but 94.
 
01:40:41.280 --> 01:40:42.410 align:start position:0%
um uh not 170 but 94.
okay

01:40:42.410 --> 01:40:42.420 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:40:46.189 --> 01:40:46.199 align:start position:0%
um trying to find my notes on 94 here
 
01:40:48.470 --> 01:40:48.480 align:start position:0%
remember we do have um executive session
 
01:40:51.350 --> 01:40:51.360 align:start position:0%
and work section notice now next week so
 
01:40:53.090 --> 01:40:53.100 align:start position:0%
if we don't find consensus today it's
 
01:40:55.010 --> 01:40:55.020 align:start position:0%
not the end of the world it's okay
 
01:40:56.270 --> 01:40:56.280 align:start position:0%
um but it just kind of gives us the
 
01:40:58.669 --> 01:40:58.679 align:start position:0%
opportunity to substance things out and
 
01:40:59.930 --> 01:40:59.940 align:start position:0%
if we do need to make an amendment it
 
01:41:01.250 --> 01:41:01.260 align:start position:0%
does get us time to get that Amendment
 
01:41:01.260 --> 01:41:02.030 align:start position:0%
does get us time to get that Amendment
ready

01:41:02.030 --> 01:41:02.040 align:start position:0%
ready
 
01:41:02.040 --> 01:41:03.470 align:start position:0%
ready
so

01:41:03.470 --> 01:41:03.480 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:41:06.110 --> 01:41:06.120 align:start position:0%
um I guess I'll uh where
 
01:41:07.610 --> 01:41:07.620 align:start position:0%
where I know it's on where's the I'm
 
01:41:08.810 --> 01:41:08.820 align:start position:0%
looking for my sorry I'm looking for my
 
01:41:10.910 --> 01:41:10.920 align:start position:0%
markup copy of one 94 and there it is
 
01:41:12.050 --> 01:41:12.060 align:start position:0%
all right
 
01:41:12.060 --> 01:41:13.729 align:start position:0%
all right
okay

01:41:13.729 --> 01:41:13.739 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:41:15.950 --> 01:41:15.960 align:start position:0%
um so let's talk about 194. does anybody
 
01:41:18.229 --> 01:41:18.239 align:start position:0%

01:41:24.050 --> 01:41:24.060 align:start position:0%
issues with the definition of child you
 
01:41:29.810 --> 01:41:29.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:31.430 --> 01:41:31.440 align:start position:0%
I want to commend the sponsor and
 
01:41:33.649 --> 01:41:33.659 align:start position:0%
everyone who worked together to put this
 
01:41:36.649 --> 01:41:36.659 align:start position:0%
um as a piece of legislation forward uh
 
01:41:38.510 --> 01:41:38.520 align:start position:0%
the the only change that I'm proposing
 
01:41:40.310 --> 01:41:40.320 align:start position:0%
and I have already sent a proposed
 
01:41:44.750 --> 01:41:44.760 align:start position:0%
amendment over to OLS is on page two
 
01:41:47.510 --> 01:41:47.520 align:start position:0%
line one section one I'm just going to
 
01:41:49.370 --> 01:41:49.380 align:start position:0%

01:42:05.410 --> 01:42:05.420 align:start position:0%
identified by the child School District
 
01:42:07.850 --> 01:42:07.860 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at DHS they're giving us a
 
01:42:09.470 --> 01:42:09.480 align:start position:0%
thumbs up on that so I'll tell you what
 
01:42:11.870 --> 01:42:11.880 align:start position:0%
uh representative if you could put me as
 
01:42:13.970 --> 01:42:13.980 align:start position:0%
a co-sponsor on that I'd appreciate it
 
01:42:16.669 --> 01:42:16.679 align:start position:0%
well so and uh you went on there as well
 
01:42:17.930 --> 01:42:17.940 align:start position:0%
representative decent money all right
 
01:42:19.250 --> 01:42:19.260 align:start position:0%
absolutely well there's ten of us who
 
01:42:21.770 --> 01:42:21.780 align:start position:0%
can all we can all sponsor we could all
 
01:42:24.050 --> 01:42:24.060 align:start position:0%
do it um let me know I'm going to send
 
01:42:25.010 --> 01:42:25.020 align:start position:0%
an email
 
01:42:26.090 --> 01:42:26.100 align:start position:0%
um okay
 
01:42:28.010 --> 01:42:28.020 align:start position:0%
um and then representative page you had
 
01:42:29.330 --> 01:42:29.340 align:start position:0%
actually concern that I had which is the
 
01:42:31.729 --> 01:42:31.739 align:start position:0%
elimination of this Wilderness Camp I
 
01:42:33.169 --> 01:42:33.179 align:start position:0%
imagine it's probably more relevant for
 
01:42:34.550 --> 01:42:34.560 align:start position:0%
you up in Conway than it is me in
 
01:42:35.629 --> 01:42:35.639 align:start position:0%
Manchester we have a different type of
 
01:42:35.639 --> 01:42:36.950 align:start position:0%
Manchester we have a different type of
wilderness

01:42:36.950 --> 01:42:36.960 align:start position:0%
wilderness
 
01:42:38.629 --> 01:42:38.639 align:start position:0%
um but I wanted to kind of get your
 
01:42:40.250 --> 01:42:40.260 align:start position:0%
thoughts on it I can say that I lived
 
01:42:41.689 --> 01:42:41.699 align:start position:0%
there I've lived there for 10 years I
 
01:42:43.370 --> 01:42:43.380 align:start position:0%
think it's I'm I'm comfortable with the
 
01:42:45.530 --> 01:42:45.540 align:start position:0%
change having heard the rationale in
 
01:42:48.229 --> 01:42:48.239 align:start position:0%
testimony okay if it's not if it's not a
 
01:42:50.149 --> 01:42:50.159 align:start position:0%
category that's being used at all then
 
01:42:52.370 --> 01:42:52.380 align:start position:0%
why retain it yeah I think my the only
 
01:42:53.510 --> 01:42:53.520 align:start position:0%
question I would have is that when was
 
01:42:55.250 --> 01:42:55.260 align:start position:0%
the last time it was used
 
01:42:56.990 --> 01:42:57.000 align:start position:0%
um but if it's not
 
01:42:58.550 --> 01:42:58.560 align:start position:0%
um you know speaking as to my
 
01:42:59.390 --> 01:42:59.400 align:start position:0%
constituency we don't have any
 
01:43:00.890 --> 01:43:00.900 align:start position:0%
Wilderness camps although I do represent
 
01:43:02.570 --> 01:43:02.580 align:start position:0%
Manchester's only state park just fun
 
01:43:04.250 --> 01:43:04.260 align:start position:0%
fact Smith Ferry Crossing you wouldn't
 
01:43:05.629 --> 01:43:05.639 align:start position:0%
know you wouldn't know it existed unless
 
01:43:08.149 --> 01:43:08.159 align:start position:0%
you lived by it which I do
 
01:43:08.159 --> 01:43:09.590 align:start position:0%
you lived by it which I do
um

01:43:09.590 --> 01:43:09.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:43:11.750 --> 01:43:11.760 align:start position:0%
I you did not you did not know it it's
 
01:43:13.129 --> 01:43:13.139 align:start position:0%
yeah and you can't here's the best part
 
01:43:14.689 --> 01:43:14.699 align:start position:0%
you cannot park there to get there um
 
01:43:16.669 --> 01:43:16.679 align:start position:0%
you can only if you live basically on my
 
01:43:17.750 --> 01:43:17.760 align:start position:0%
street only if you live there can you
 
01:43:18.590 --> 01:43:18.600 align:start position:0%
get there because there's no parking
 
01:43:18.600 --> 01:43:19.370 align:start position:0%
get there because there's no parking
yeah

01:43:19.370 --> 01:43:19.380 align:start position:0%

01:43:21.229 --> 01:43:21.239 align:start position:0%

01:43:58.980 --> 01:44:01.689 align:start position:0%
if there is a complaint of
non-compliance

01:44:01.689 --> 01:44:01.699 align:start position:0%
non-compliance
 
01:44:05.570 --> 01:44:05.580 align:start position:0%
and these generally aren't year-round so
 
01:44:08.229 --> 01:44:08.239 align:start position:0%
would there would there be an like
 
01:44:12.649 --> 01:44:12.659 align:start position:0%
expedited procedure for
 
01:44:14.570 --> 01:44:14.580 align:start position:0%
taking care of something that might be
 
01:44:18.050 --> 01:44:18.060 align:start position:0%
out of out of compliance or a complaint
 
01:44:18.060 --> 01:44:20.810 align:start position:0%
out of out of compliance or a complaint
um

01:44:20.810 --> 01:44:20.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:22.790 --> 01:44:22.800 align:start position:0%
I think that's a question for uh for
 
01:44:25.370 --> 01:44:25.380 align:start position:0%
Miss Clement who I uh
 
01:44:27.350 --> 01:44:27.360 align:start position:0%
I think she signs those letters or at
 
01:44:28.850 --> 01:44:28.860 align:start position:0%
least her staff signs of letters on her
 
01:44:28.860 --> 01:44:32.709 align:start position:0%
least her staff signs of letters on her
behalf

01:44:32.709 --> 01:44:32.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:34.609 --> 01:44:34.619 align:start position:0%
all right thank you Mr chair
 
01:44:36.290 --> 01:44:36.300 align:start position:0%
representative committee
 
01:44:37.790 --> 01:44:37.800 align:start position:0%
um do you need me to State my name no
 
01:44:39.410 --> 01:44:39.420 align:start position:0%
you're fine no it's work session I know
 
01:44:41.090 --> 01:44:41.100 align:start position:0%
it's a little different we know who you
 
01:44:42.590 --> 01:44:42.600 align:start position:0%
are um thank you for the question so
 
01:44:44.810 --> 01:44:44.820 align:start position:0%
anytime we receive a complaint we
 
01:44:46.729 --> 01:44:46.739 align:start position:0%
respond as quickly as possible we don't
 
01:44:48.770 --> 01:44:48.780 align:start position:0%
wait on that so if we receive a
 
01:44:50.629 --> 01:44:50.639 align:start position:0%
complaint that occurred after Camp
 
01:44:52.609 --> 01:44:52.619 align:start position:0%
season is over we do still contact
 
01:44:55.129 --> 01:44:55.139 align:start position:0%
relevant parties whether it's the person
 
01:44:57.350 --> 01:44:57.360 align:start position:0%
who made the complaint to us we'll talk
 
01:44:59.450 --> 01:44:59.460 align:start position:0%
to them we'll talk to the camp we do
 
01:45:01.850 --> 01:45:01.860 align:start position:0%
what we can when Camp is not in session
 
01:45:03.169 --> 01:45:03.179 align:start position:0%
if it's a complaint regarding the
 
01:45:04.609 --> 01:45:04.619 align:start position:0%
physical space that's obviously a little
 
01:45:06.169 --> 01:45:06.179 align:start position:0%
more difficult if they're not operating
 
01:45:08.090 --> 01:45:08.100 align:start position:0%
but we do follow up with the program we
 
01:45:09.770 --> 01:45:09.780 align:start position:0%
follow up with all relevant parties and
 
01:45:13.209 --> 01:45:13.219 align:start position:0%
conduct our investigation in that manner
 
01:45:15.830 --> 01:45:15.840 align:start position:0%
if there's something that's egregious
 
01:45:17.810 --> 01:45:17.820 align:start position:0%
and you know in week one
 
01:45:19.790 --> 01:45:19.800 align:start position:0%
um and there's only 12 weeks of that
 
01:45:19.800 --> 01:45:20.750 align:start position:0%
um and there's only 12 weeks of that
camp

01:45:20.750 --> 01:45:20.760 align:start position:0%
camp
 
01:45:24.229 --> 01:45:24.239 align:start position:0%
um would it be something that would
 
01:45:26.629 --> 01:45:26.639 align:start position:0%
I don't mean to say that every complaint
 
01:45:29.090 --> 01:45:29.100 align:start position:0%
isn't important but given that the the
 
01:45:31.910 --> 01:45:31.920 align:start position:0%
length of time that that kids will see
 
01:45:31.920 --> 01:45:32.990 align:start position:0%
length of time that that kids will see
there

01:45:32.990 --> 01:45:33.000 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:45:34.970 --> 01:45:34.980 align:start position:0%
um how is that handled I guess we would
 
01:45:37.189 --> 01:45:37.199 align:start position:0%
always go out there when we know that
 
01:45:38.990 --> 01:45:39.000 align:start position:0%
Camp's in session so if we get a
 
01:45:40.970 --> 01:45:40.980 align:start position:0%
complaint in week one and we know we
 
01:45:43.070 --> 01:45:43.080 align:start position:0%
know what weeks they're operating we
 
01:45:44.870 --> 01:45:44.880 align:start position:0%
ensure that somebody gets out there so
 
01:45:46.609 --> 01:45:46.619 align:start position:0%
that they can do the investigation thank
 
01:45:48.649 --> 01:45:48.659 align:start position:0%
you I appreciate it
 
01:45:50.870 --> 01:45:50.880 align:start position:0%
what are the questions from his Clement
 
01:45:52.370 --> 01:45:52.380 align:start position:0%
um probably something that I noticed in
 
01:45:53.810 --> 01:45:53.820 align:start position:0%
here is you know it allows them to show
 
01:45:55.609 --> 01:45:55.619 align:start position:0%
up unannounced which sort of 24-hour
 
01:45:57.950 --> 01:45:57.960 align:start position:0%
program but there's no way to get around
 
01:45:59.090 --> 01:45:59.100 align:start position:0%
that you have to be able to show up
 
01:46:01.550 --> 01:46:01.560 align:start position:0%
unannounced uh I just had this like it's
 
01:46:02.930 --> 01:46:02.940 align:start position:0%
like is this person going to be out at
 
01:46:04.550 --> 01:46:04.560 align:start position:0%
three o'clock in the morning but I I
 
01:46:07.250 --> 01:46:07.260 align:start position:0%
highly doubt that so it might like in
 
01:46:08.149 --> 01:46:08.159 align:start position:0%
the first course like in first
 
01:46:09.590 --> 01:46:09.600 align:start position:0%
legislative brain I'm like should we
 
01:46:11.209 --> 01:46:11.219 align:start position:0%
restrain that I'm like no we're not stop
 
01:46:13.250 --> 01:46:13.260 align:start position:0%
don't go down that path don't go down
 
01:46:15.050 --> 01:46:15.060 align:start position:0%
that path sorry it's just these are the
 
01:46:16.250 --> 01:46:16.260 align:start position:0%
things that go through might be typical
 
01:46:17.629 --> 01:46:17.639 align:start position:0%
now yeah that would be yeah it was like
 
01:46:19.910 --> 01:46:19.920 align:start position:0%
that juice is not worth the squeeze
 
01:46:19.920 --> 01:46:20.750 align:start position:0%
that juice is not worth the squeeze
um

01:46:20.750 --> 01:46:20.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:46:22.609 --> 01:46:22.619 align:start position:0%
so uh any other questions from his
 
01:46:24.290 --> 01:46:24.300 align:start position:0%
Clement while we have or um anything
 
01:46:26.149 --> 01:46:26.159 align:start position:0%
specifically about
 
01:46:26.159 --> 01:46:26.870 align:start position:0%
specifically about
um

01:46:26.870 --> 01:46:26.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:46:29.149 --> 01:46:29.159 align:start position:0%
other than the one amendment that
 
01:46:30.950 --> 01:46:30.960 align:start position:0%
represent McWilliams can report anything
 
01:46:33.229 --> 01:46:33.239 align:start position:0%
else on SB 94 before we start arguing
 
01:46:36.050 --> 01:46:36.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:37.850 --> 01:46:37.860 align:start position:0%
all right thank you Miss Clement um all
 
01:46:41.510 --> 01:46:41.520 align:start position:0%
right so gonna put SB 94 aside for next
 
01:46:41.520 --> 01:46:42.830 align:start position:0%
right so gonna put SB 94 aside for next
week

01:46:42.830 --> 01:46:42.840 align:start position:0%
week
 
01:46:45.109 --> 01:46:45.119 align:start position:0%
um and we'll um Mr McWilliams when you
 
01:46:46.490 --> 01:46:46.500 align:start position:0%
get that and I guess I'm on it so I'll
 
01:46:48.229 --> 01:46:48.239 align:start position:0%
see it too but when we get the finalized
 
01:46:49.490 --> 01:46:49.500 align:start position:0%
version of it we'll circulate it to the
 
01:46:51.649 --> 01:46:51.659 align:start position:0%
committee because uh we will do that all
 
01:46:54.950 --> 01:46:54.960 align:start position:0%
right so now let's talk about fire codes
 
01:46:58.669 --> 01:46:58.679 align:start position:0%
all right sb17 sb170 who's excited
 
01:46:58.679 --> 01:46:59.990 align:start position:0%
all right sb17 sb170 who's excited
okay

01:46:59.990 --> 01:47:00.000 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:47:02.390 --> 01:47:02.400 align:start position:0%
um so I'll kind of give uh chair usually
 
01:47:03.410 --> 01:47:03.420 align:start position:0%
goes last but I'll kind of give my
 
01:47:06.229 --> 01:47:06.239 align:start position:0%
opening thoughts on this um we need to
 
01:47:08.149 --> 01:47:08.159 align:start position:0%
need to need to bring
 
01:47:10.129 --> 01:47:10.139 align:start position:0%
when you find a way to bring this into
 
01:47:12.470 --> 01:47:12.480 align:start position:0%
law that we all are comfortable with
 
01:47:14.090 --> 01:47:14.100 align:start position:0%
um it definitely needs to happen IT
 
01:47:17.390 --> 01:47:17.400 align:start position:0%
addresses the number one problem uh with
 
01:47:18.649 --> 01:47:18.659 align:start position:0%
we haven't the state of New Hampshire
 
01:47:20.330 --> 01:47:20.340 align:start position:0%
now which is supply for child care
 
01:47:22.490 --> 01:47:22.500 align:start position:0%
supply is number one problem
 
01:47:22.500 --> 01:47:23.270 align:start position:0%
supply is number one problem
um

01:47:23.270 --> 01:47:23.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:47:25.850 --> 01:47:25.860 align:start position:0%
so there are legitimate I think there
 
01:47:28.010 --> 01:47:28.020 align:start position:0%
are legitimate concerns with um fairness
 
01:47:29.930 --> 01:47:29.940 align:start position:0%
and safety
 
01:47:32.510 --> 01:47:32.520 align:start position:0%
um uh speaking personally I I have issue
 
01:47:34.129 --> 01:47:34.139 align:start position:0%
I always take issue not just with child
 
01:47:35.390 --> 01:47:35.400 align:start position:0%
care but with everything I do
 
01:47:37.250 --> 01:47:37.260 align:start position:0%
legislative of rules for thee but not
 
01:47:38.390 --> 01:47:38.400 align:start position:0%
for me
 
01:47:39.890 --> 01:47:39.900 align:start position:0%
um it's just kind of a general guiding
 
01:47:41.209 --> 01:47:41.219 align:start position:0%
principle that I have
 
01:47:43.550 --> 01:47:43.560 align:start position:0%
um so I do take issue with um
 
01:47:45.350 --> 01:47:45.360 align:start position:0%
grandfathering some and then not
 
01:47:47.930 --> 01:47:47.940 align:start position:0%
allowing the others so my personal goal
 
01:47:49.669 --> 01:47:49.679 align:start position:0%
is that we could find a way to marry
 
01:47:51.109 --> 01:47:51.119 align:start position:0%
those two in
 
01:47:52.490 --> 01:47:52.500 align:start position:0%
um and I think represent Warner I think
 
01:47:53.810 --> 01:47:53.820 align:start position:0%
you hinted at something which should be
 
01:47:55.850 --> 01:47:55.860 align:start position:0%
instead of beating up the licensing
 
01:47:56.990 --> 01:47:57.000 align:start position:0%
requirement looking at the fire code
 
01:47:58.430 --> 01:47:58.440 align:start position:0%
requirement which is definitely outside
 
01:48:00.050 --> 01:48:00.060 align:start position:0%
of our scope at least am I putting words
 
01:48:01.729 --> 01:48:01.739 align:start position:0%
in your mouth I don't want to put words
 
01:48:03.290 --> 01:48:03.300 align:start position:0%
in your mouth if I am doing that but I
 
01:48:05.330 --> 01:48:05.340 align:start position:0%
think that's what you implied
 
01:48:08.270 --> 01:48:08.280 align:start position:0%
it was just a question yes okay it was a
 
01:48:10.310 --> 01:48:10.320 align:start position:0%
question it was an implication
 
01:48:10.320 --> 01:48:10.970 align:start position:0%
question it was an implication
um

01:48:10.970 --> 01:48:10.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:48:12.590 --> 01:48:12.600 align:start position:0%
but I do
 
01:48:15.350 --> 01:48:15.360 align:start position:0%
I I do have physics because it does it
 
01:48:17.570 --> 01:48:17.580 align:start position:0%
does raise the question which is there's
 
01:48:19.129 --> 01:48:19.139 align:start position:0%
38 centers that's what we heard right
 
01:48:20.629 --> 01:48:20.639 align:start position:0%
who fall who would be grandfathered and
 
01:48:23.030 --> 01:48:23.040 align:start position:0%
that's what we heard 38 centers so it
 
01:48:24.950 --> 01:48:24.960 align:start position:0%
does raise the very legitimate question
 
01:48:27.050 --> 01:48:27.060 align:start position:0%
which is
 
01:48:29.330 --> 01:48:29.340 align:start position:0%
if it's not safe why are these 38
 
01:48:32.090 --> 01:48:32.100 align:start position:0%
centers allowed to do it right so um and
 
01:48:33.290 --> 01:48:33.300 align:start position:0%
I get that their grandfather and I
 
01:48:35.750 --> 01:48:35.760 align:start position:0%
totally I totally get that but like okay
 
01:48:37.310 --> 01:48:37.320 align:start position:0%
so what's what's the deal then like if
 
01:48:38.570 --> 01:48:38.580 align:start position:0%
there's 38 they're getting grandfathered
 
01:48:42.189 --> 01:48:42.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:44.209 --> 01:48:44.219 align:start position:0%
Nelson you're more than welcome to speak
 
01:48:45.229 --> 01:48:45.239 align:start position:0%
when I was
 
01:48:47.450 --> 01:48:47.460 align:start position:0%
drinking that out there to them
 
01:48:47.460 --> 01:48:52.430 align:start position:0%
drinking that out there to them
um

01:48:52.430 --> 01:48:52.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:54.229 --> 01:48:54.239 align:start position:0%
so Sean to me on the State Fire Marshal
 
01:48:56.870 --> 01:48:56.880 align:start position:0%
I get what I want to I guess reiterate
 
01:48:58.609 --> 01:48:58.619 align:start position:0%
is that there's really there's no
 
01:49:00.830 --> 01:49:00.840 align:start position:0%
grandfather on the fire code so the
 
01:49:02.570 --> 01:49:02.580 align:start position:0%
centers are safe right so they're
 
01:49:04.010 --> 01:49:04.020 align:start position:0%
inspected periodically by the fire
 
01:49:07.609 --> 01:49:07.619 align:start position:0%
officials and is licensed by the um DHHS
 
01:49:10.430 --> 01:49:10.440 align:start position:0%
um through the licensing program
 
01:49:12.410 --> 01:49:12.420 align:start position:0%
the way I picture the grandfathering is
 
01:49:14.090 --> 01:49:14.100 align:start position:0%
it's administrative process on some of
 
01:49:16.370 --> 01:49:16.380 align:start position:0%
the name changes stuff
 
01:49:18.470 --> 01:49:18.480 align:start position:0%
um so the
 
01:49:21.350 --> 01:49:21.360 align:start position:0%
the group daycare Family Day Care all
 
01:49:23.689 --> 01:49:23.699 align:start position:0%
those different terms are a little bit
 
01:49:25.189 --> 01:49:25.199 align:start position:0%
clunky right now between the State
 
01:49:26.810 --> 01:49:26.820 align:start position:0%
Building Code the state fire code and
 
01:49:29.930 --> 01:49:29.940 align:start position:0%
DHHS language and we're trying to clean
 
01:49:32.149 --> 01:49:32.159 align:start position:0%
that all up which I think this bill does
 
01:49:33.950 --> 01:49:33.960 align:start position:0%
a great job at
 
01:49:36.290 --> 01:49:36.300 align:start position:0%
um what the bill also does is in the
 
01:49:37.850 --> 01:49:37.860 align:start position:0%
fire code
 
01:49:40.490 --> 01:49:40.500 align:start position:0%
um we look at those so small centers
 
01:49:43.669 --> 01:49:43.679 align:start position:0%
Under 12 can be in a home or outside of
 
01:49:46.070 --> 01:49:46.080 align:start position:0%
a home and still be called family group
 
01:49:48.169 --> 01:49:48.179 align:start position:0%
daycare they can beat a small under the
 
01:49:50.810 --> 01:49:50.820 align:start position:0%
as Deputy Katie mentioned like the three
 
01:49:52.910 --> 01:49:52.920 align:start position:0%
to sixes or up the seven to twelfths
 
01:49:56.090 --> 01:49:56.100 align:start position:0%
under DHHS rules currently those little
 
01:49:58.430 --> 01:49:58.440 align:start position:0%
centers are something else when they go
 
01:49:59.930 --> 01:49:59.940 align:start position:0%
outside into a business or something
 
01:50:01.970 --> 01:50:01.980 align:start position:0%
like that so we're trying to that's it's
 
01:50:04.550 --> 01:50:04.560 align:start position:0%
it's I know it's muddy right it's it's a
 
01:50:07.490 --> 01:50:07.500 align:start position:0%
the really the intent of 170 is to try
 
01:50:09.050 --> 01:50:09.060 align:start position:0%
to clean this all up and make it easier
 
01:50:12.109 --> 01:50:12.119 align:start position:0%
I would almost beg you not to try to
 
01:50:13.669 --> 01:50:13.679 align:start position:0%
change the fire code because then we'd
 
01:50:14.810 --> 01:50:14.820 align:start position:0%
also be trying to change the State
 
01:50:17.149 --> 01:50:17.159 align:start position:0%
Building Code too right now the same
 
01:50:18.410 --> 01:50:18.420 align:start position:0%
building code and the state fire code
 
01:50:21.350 --> 01:50:21.360 align:start position:0%
are really close and we've worked really
 
01:50:22.669 --> 01:50:22.679 align:start position:0%
hard over the last few years and
 
01:50:24.770 --> 01:50:24.780 align:start position:0%
representative Williams has been part of
 
01:50:27.890 --> 01:50:27.900 align:start position:0%
some of those conversations through Edna
 
01:50:30.649 --> 01:50:30.659 align:start position:0%
um we're really trying to minimize
 
01:50:32.270 --> 01:50:32.280 align:start position:0%
conflict with the codes to make it
 
01:50:34.250 --> 01:50:34.260 align:start position:0%
easier for the consumers whether it's a
 
01:50:36.649 --> 01:50:36.659 align:start position:0%
small business owner or a developer
 
01:50:38.330 --> 01:50:38.340 align:start position:0%
architect engineer designer whatever
 
01:50:40.970 --> 01:50:40.980 align:start position:0%
design professional they are it's we
 
01:50:44.209 --> 01:50:44.219 align:start position:0%
take National codes building or fire and
 
01:50:45.770 --> 01:50:45.780 align:start position:0%
hampshireize them a little bit through
 
01:50:48.410 --> 01:50:48.420 align:start position:0%
the respective processes get them uh
 
01:50:50.390 --> 01:50:50.400 align:start position:0%
ratified through the general court and
 
01:50:52.490 --> 01:50:52.500 align:start position:0%
we've done a great job at
 
01:50:54.709 --> 01:50:54.719 align:start position:0%
we got a little way to go but we've done
 
01:50:56.270 --> 01:50:56.280 align:start position:0%
a great job to clean those up over the
 
01:50:58.850 --> 01:50:58.860 align:start position:0%
last five years or so I'd hate to try to
 
01:51:01.370 --> 01:51:01.380 align:start position:0%
muddy the waters so we're we're taking
 
01:51:03.649 --> 01:51:03.659 align:start position:0%
some rules in some other statute
 
01:51:06.109 --> 01:51:06.119 align:start position:0%
language that's not in alignment and
 
01:51:08.450 --> 01:51:08.460 align:start position:0%
trying to align it is really what I I
 
01:51:10.669 --> 01:51:10.679 align:start position:0%
see this as doing I I want to repeat
 
01:51:10.679 --> 01:51:11.689 align:start position:0%
see this as doing I I want to repeat
myself

01:51:11.689 --> 01:51:11.699 align:start position:0%
myself
 
01:51:13.850 --> 01:51:13.860 align:start position:0%
the the centers are safe they're being
 
01:51:15.830 --> 01:51:15.840 align:start position:0%
inspected I'm going to say though
 
01:51:17.629 --> 01:51:17.639 align:start position:0%
there's some places in the state that
 
01:51:19.010 --> 01:51:19.020 align:start position:0%
maybe they're not getting expected quite
 
01:51:21.350 --> 01:51:21.360 align:start position:0%
to the level they should be and we can
 
01:51:23.270 --> 01:51:23.280 align:start position:0%
help them do that and make sure they are
 
01:51:25.669 --> 01:51:25.679 align:start position:0%
truly safe but the structure of the
 
01:51:28.609 --> 01:51:28.619 align:start position:0%
codes is in place new or existing to
 
01:51:30.229 --> 01:51:30.239 align:start position:0%
make sure they meet our our current
 
01:51:33.350 --> 01:51:33.360 align:start position:0%
building and fire code so I there I
 
01:51:35.570 --> 01:51:35.580 align:start position:0%
would really the grandfathering is is
 
01:51:38.570 --> 01:51:38.580 align:start position:0%
not safety related from the code
 
01:51:40.729 --> 01:51:40.739 align:start position:0%
perspective it's a DHHS grandfather not
 
01:51:43.810 --> 01:51:43.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:46.430 --> 01:51:46.440 align:start position:0%
it's more administrative
 
01:51:48.649 --> 01:51:48.659 align:start position:0%
grandfathering is the way I that's the
 
01:51:50.390 --> 01:51:50.400 align:start position:0%
way I've gotten it in my head to try to
 
01:51:53.510 --> 01:51:53.520 align:start position:0%
I don't like grandfathering either so
 
01:51:55.430 --> 01:51:55.440 align:start position:0%
um there's no one existing in my world
 
01:51:57.470 --> 01:51:57.480 align:start position:0%
and you meet one or the other
 
01:51:59.750 --> 01:51:59.760 align:start position:0%
um and and I will say if there's unique
 
01:52:01.850 --> 01:52:01.860 align:start position:0%
circumstances on the fire code
 
01:52:03.830 --> 01:52:03.840 align:start position:0%
me being the State Fire Marshal has the
 
01:52:05.149 --> 01:52:05.159 align:start position:0%
authority to issue a variance under
 
01:52:07.430 --> 01:52:07.440 align:start position:0%
specific circumstances if there's other
 
01:52:10.430 --> 01:52:10.440 align:start position:0%
Provisions that provide a degree of
 
01:52:13.370 --> 01:52:13.380 align:start position:0%
safety some equivalency so we have some
 
01:52:14.930 --> 01:52:14.940 align:start position:0%
options if we have some of those weird
 
01:52:14.940 --> 01:52:16.669 align:start position:0%
options if we have some of those weird
situations

01:52:16.669 --> 01:52:16.679 align:start position:0%
situations
 
01:52:17.870 --> 01:52:17.880 align:start position:0%
um that they would come to my office
 
01:52:20.270 --> 01:52:20.280 align:start position:0%
we'd process them go visit the site I
 
01:52:22.910 --> 01:52:22.920 align:start position:0%
was at one in in Lee just the other day
 
01:52:22.920 --> 01:52:24.350 align:start position:0%
was at one in in Lee just the other day
that's

01:52:24.350 --> 01:52:24.360 align:start position:0%
that's
 
01:52:25.790 --> 01:52:25.800 align:start position:0%
um we're working with the operator to
 
01:52:27.470 --> 01:52:27.480 align:start position:0%
make sure it's it's been operating for
 
01:52:29.689 --> 01:52:29.699 align:start position:0%
probably 30 years-ish
 
01:52:32.270 --> 01:52:32.280 align:start position:0%
and we we're going to let them they're
 
01:52:34.070 --> 01:52:34.080 align:start position:0%
going to make a few minor changes and
 
01:52:35.330 --> 01:52:35.340 align:start position:0%
they're going to be allowed to operate
 
01:52:37.729 --> 01:52:37.739 align:start position:0%
the way they are under a variance I
 
01:52:38.930 --> 01:52:38.940 align:start position:0%
appreciate that clarification I think
 
01:52:40.250 --> 01:52:40.260 align:start position:0%
that did help me representative someone
 
01:52:41.689 --> 01:52:41.699 align:start position:0%
you had a question
 
01:52:44.270 --> 01:52:44.280 align:start position:0%
thank you yes I do I I just want to be
 
01:52:47.390 --> 01:52:47.400 align:start position:0%
clear so existing
 
01:52:50.750 --> 01:52:50.760 align:start position:0%
currently existing licensed
 
01:52:50.760 --> 01:52:53.330 align:start position:0%
currently existing licensed
centers

01:52:53.330 --> 01:52:53.340 align:start position:0%
centers
 
01:52:57.470 --> 01:52:57.480 align:start position:0%
are in compliance with
 
01:53:03.169 --> 01:53:03.179 align:start position:0%
the the state fire codes supposed to be
 
01:53:06.530 --> 01:53:06.540 align:start position:0%
supposed to be so as far as I know thank
 
01:53:06.540 --> 01:53:08.330 align:start position:0%
supposed to be so as far as I know thank
you

01:53:08.330 --> 01:53:08.340 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:53:10.790 --> 01:53:10.800 align:start position:0%
as far as I know there could be there's
 
01:53:10.800 --> 01:53:12.649 align:start position:0%
as far as I know there could be there's
there's

01:53:12.649 --> 01:53:12.659 align:start position:0%
there's
 
01:53:14.750 --> 01:53:14.760 align:start position:0%
so why are we grandfathering anything
 
01:53:17.030 --> 01:53:17.040 align:start position:0%
because it's a deal it's a dhh
 
01:53:19.250 --> 01:53:19.260 align:start position:0%
administrative I see thank you because
 
01:53:21.229 --> 01:53:21.239 align:start position:0%
we're changing some names right so we're
 
01:53:23.390 --> 01:53:23.400 align:start position:0%
changing some names of some things in
 
01:53:26.090 --> 01:53:26.100 align:start position:0%
yeah it's trying to catch up with all of
 
01:53:28.430 --> 01:53:28.440 align:start position:0%
that is really I'm hearing some yeses
 
01:53:30.890 --> 01:53:30.900 align:start position:0%
behind us yeah yeah they were giving the
 
01:53:32.330 --> 01:53:32.340 align:start position:0%
thumbs up when I said it's a thcs
 
01:53:33.530 --> 01:53:33.540 align:start position:0%
grandfather and they were super excited
 
01:53:35.270 --> 01:53:35.280 align:start position:0%
that they're like representative you're
 
01:53:35.280 --> 01:53:36.109 align:start position:0%
that they're like representative you're
welcome

01:53:36.109 --> 01:53:36.119 align:start position:0%
welcome
 
01:53:36.119 --> 01:53:36.950 align:start position:0%
welcome
um

01:53:36.950 --> 01:53:36.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:53:49.370 --> 01:53:49.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:55.790 --> 01:53:55.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:55.800 --> 01:53:56.930 align:start position:0%
 
that

01:53:56.930 --> 01:53:56.940 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:54:06.109 --> 01:54:06.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:06.119 --> 01:54:08.229 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:54:08.229 --> 01:54:08.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:08.239 --> 01:54:09.790 align:start position:0%
 
or

01:54:09.790 --> 01:54:09.800 align:start position:0%
or
 
01:54:17.270 --> 01:54:17.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:19.790 --> 01:54:19.800 align:start position:0%
so I would stick to I just want to read
 
01:54:22.129 --> 01:54:22.139 align:start position:0%
this here I would stick to the the
 
01:54:25.070 --> 01:54:25.080 align:start position:0%
numbers of six and seven to twelve and
 
01:54:27.470 --> 01:54:27.480 align:start position:0%
things like that for alignment
 
01:54:29.149 --> 01:54:29.159 align:start position:0%
um I'm gonna just I'm gonna phone a
 
01:54:30.770 --> 01:54:30.780 align:start position:0%
friend in the back because I wasn't part
 
01:54:33.530 --> 01:54:33.540 align:start position:0%
of this original striking part of it but
 
01:54:33.540 --> 01:54:34.129 align:start position:0%
of this original striking part of it but
um

01:54:34.129 --> 01:54:34.139 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:54:36.709 --> 01:54:36.719 align:start position:0%
my concern I think is that if we
 
01:54:39.010 --> 01:54:39.020 align:start position:0%
unstrike something it's gonna
 
01:54:42.590 --> 01:54:42.600 align:start position:0%
go back to not aligning well with what
 
01:54:44.510 --> 01:54:44.520 align:start position:0%
we're trying to do
 
01:54:47.450 --> 01:54:47.460 align:start position:0%
um does that make sense I I think the
 
01:54:48.770 --> 01:54:48.780 align:start position:0%
concern of the committee not to speak
 
01:54:49.970 --> 01:54:49.980 align:start position:0%
representation but to try to speak
 
01:54:52.910 --> 01:54:52.920 align:start position:0%
verification is that if we if we don't
 
01:54:55.729 --> 01:54:55.739 align:start position:0%
unstrike that our representative's point
 
01:54:57.410 --> 01:54:57.420 align:start position:0%
is we unstrike it and put in a thing
 
01:54:58.910 --> 01:54:58.920 align:start position:0%
about so long as it complies with the
 
01:55:00.770 --> 01:55:00.780 align:start position:0%
state fire code right that's what you're
 
01:55:05.689 --> 01:55:05.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:10.250 --> 01:55:10.260 align:start position:0%
for DHHS for thhs uh and I think it's I
 
01:55:12.229 --> 01:55:12.239 align:start position:0%
think that the sentiment is the
 
01:55:14.510 --> 01:55:14.520 align:start position:0%
sentiment is that it's at least speaking
 
01:55:17.270 --> 01:55:17.280 align:start position:0%
personally is I'm fine if they're if
 
01:55:19.310 --> 01:55:19.320 align:start position:0%
they're misaligned to the extent that
 
01:55:21.890 --> 01:55:21.900 align:start position:0%
we're not choking the supply that's safe
 
01:55:23.570 --> 01:55:23.580 align:start position:0%
right so if it's to represent
 
01:55:25.370 --> 01:55:25.380 align:start position:0%
Christian's point if it's in alignment
 
01:55:27.850 --> 01:55:27.860 align:start position:0%
with the state fire code I'd rather
 
01:55:30.169 --> 01:55:30.179 align:start position:0%
unstrike it put in a closet it's got to
 
01:55:31.310 --> 01:55:31.320 align:start position:0%
comply with the state fire code
 
01:55:32.750 --> 01:55:32.760 align:start position:0%
regardless of the number if it's
 
01:55:35.450 --> 01:55:35.460 align:start position:0%
misaligned and not cut off that support
 
01:55:37.669 --> 01:55:37.679 align:start position:0%
potential Supply
 
01:55:39.649 --> 01:55:39.659 align:start position:0%
um I I think is that that's that that's
 
01:55:42.470 --> 01:55:42.480 align:start position:0%
my feeling on it I know just may not may
 
01:55:43.609 --> 01:55:43.619 align:start position:0%
not like that as much because it is
 
01:55:47.090 --> 01:55:47.100 align:start position:0%
misaligned but I I I I am I'm gonna have
 
01:55:49.310 --> 01:55:49.320 align:start position:0%
I want to pass this I really like I
 
01:55:51.470 --> 01:55:51.480 align:start position:0%
really really do I am going to have
 
01:55:54.470 --> 01:55:54.480 align:start position:0%
problems choking any Supply down right
 
01:55:54.480 --> 01:55:55.430 align:start position:0%
problems choking any Supply down right
now

01:55:55.430 --> 01:55:55.440 align:start position:0%
now
 
01:55:58.310 --> 01:55:58.320 align:start position:0%
um especially in the current situation
 
01:56:00.950 --> 01:56:00.960 align:start position:0%
I think one just
 
01:56:03.290 --> 01:56:03.300 align:start position:0%
trying to name things the same in
 
01:56:05.330 --> 01:56:05.340 align:start position:0%
different places
 
01:56:08.090 --> 01:56:08.100 align:start position:0%
um I think it's important because for
 
01:56:08.100 --> 01:56:09.229 align:start position:0%
um I think it's important because for
years

01:56:09.229 --> 01:56:09.239 align:start position:0%
years
 
01:56:11.689 --> 01:56:11.699 align:start position:0%
before I had this position I worked in
 
01:56:13.430 --> 01:56:13.440 align:start position:0%
Concord as an inspector for a long time
 
01:56:16.550 --> 01:56:16.560 align:start position:0%
too and trying to figure out okay I have
 
01:56:18.950 --> 01:56:18.960 align:start position:0%
dhhs's form that I have to sign off as a
 
01:56:20.689 --> 01:56:20.699 align:start position:0%
fire inspector this place is safe right
 
01:56:22.189 --> 01:56:22.199 align:start position:0%
I know the fire code I've been working
 
01:56:23.510 --> 01:56:23.520 align:start position:0%
on it and living in it for a long time
 
01:56:25.910 --> 01:56:25.920 align:start position:0%
but okay is this a daycare occupancy or
 
01:56:27.530 --> 01:56:27.540 align:start position:0%
is this a daycare home or is this a
 
01:56:29.990 --> 01:56:30.000 align:start position:0%
daycare center or is this like so as a
 
01:56:31.729 --> 01:56:31.739 align:start position:0%
Fire official and I think even for the
 
01:56:35.270 --> 01:56:35.280 align:start position:0%
operator it's confusing right I have I
 
01:56:36.709 --> 01:56:36.719 align:start position:0%
have this form that says this I'm
 
01:56:38.870 --> 01:56:38.880 align:start position:0%
calling the fire chief said I need to
 
01:56:40.850 --> 01:56:40.860 align:start position:0%
get a sign off on this and I'm sitting
 
01:56:42.109 --> 01:56:42.119 align:start position:0%
here scratching my house as a Fire
 
01:56:43.550 --> 01:56:43.560 align:start position:0%
official saying
 
01:56:46.250 --> 01:56:46.260 align:start position:0%
hmm I know if it just simply says
 
01:56:47.750 --> 01:56:47.760 align:start position:0%
compile with the state fire code it
 
01:56:49.010 --> 01:56:49.020 align:start position:0%
would make sense
 
01:56:52.850 --> 01:56:52.860 align:start position:0%
but then I need to know what I mean
 
01:56:54.050 --> 01:56:54.060 align:start position:0%
people they're going to put in there
 
01:56:56.450 --> 01:56:56.460 align:start position:0%
right so if it just says Cloud plot
 
01:56:58.070 --> 01:56:58.080 align:start position:0%
comply with a state fire code I go to
 
01:56:59.149 --> 01:56:59.159 align:start position:0%
say the Opera how many people are going
 
01:57:00.350 --> 01:57:00.360 align:start position:0%
to do I'm going to do 12. I'm going to
 
01:57:02.629 --> 01:57:02.639 align:start position:0%
do 20. okay I'm going to open my book to
 
01:57:04.010 --> 01:57:04.020 align:start position:0%
the chapter I'm going to go through my
 
01:57:05.629 --> 01:57:05.639 align:start position:0%
chapter I'm going to say yup yup yup you
 
01:57:07.370 --> 01:57:07.380 align:start position:0%
made all these things comply with State
 
01:57:08.450 --> 01:57:08.460 align:start position:0%
Fire code
 
01:57:09.830 --> 01:57:09.840 align:start position:0%
but then they're going to go to the
 
01:57:12.649 --> 01:57:12.659 align:start position:0%
licensing facility and say
 
01:57:15.050 --> 01:57:15.060 align:start position:0%
um I want this number of people in the
 
01:57:17.209 --> 01:57:17.219 align:start position:0%
in the this the numbers are different
 
01:57:19.370 --> 01:57:19.380 align:start position:0%
right so I'm going to go just real quick
 
01:57:21.410 --> 01:57:21.420 align:start position:0%
example we saw the liquor folks out in
 
01:57:23.030 --> 01:57:23.040 align:start position:0%
the hallway before we got here right and
 
01:57:25.370 --> 01:57:25.380 align:start position:0%
we overlap with them a bit right so we
 
01:57:27.470 --> 01:57:27.480 align:start position:0%
issue places as places of assembly
 
01:57:31.910 --> 01:57:31.920 align:start position:0%
permits by law and the we've worked
 
01:57:33.350 --> 01:57:33.360 align:start position:0%
really hard with them too to make sure
 
01:57:35.750 --> 01:57:35.760 align:start position:0%
that the numbers the number when they
 
01:57:37.550 --> 01:57:37.560 align:start position:0%
need an assembly permit to issue a
 
01:57:40.310 --> 01:57:40.320 align:start position:0%
liquor license the stuff matches as best
 
01:57:42.950 --> 01:57:42.960 align:start position:0%
as it can be so when I'm always I heard
 
01:57:44.870 --> 01:57:44.880 align:start position:0%
O's right when O's looks for Concord
 
01:57:46.370 --> 01:57:46.380 align:start position:0%
fire to issue the place of assembly
 
01:57:49.490 --> 01:57:49.500 align:start position:0%
permit they know 100 people they need us
 
01:57:51.350 --> 01:57:51.360 align:start position:0%
they need a permit we were the cogifier
 
01:57:52.669 --> 01:57:52.679 align:start position:0%
rates department they send the liquor
 
01:57:54.410 --> 01:57:54.420 align:start position:0%
and they get their liquor license and
 
01:57:56.629 --> 01:57:56.639 align:start position:0%
it's pretty smooth and I think that when
 
01:57:59.270 --> 01:57:59.280 align:start position:0%
I see Family Daycare home means this and
 
01:58:00.589 --> 01:58:00.599 align:start position:0%
then I go to the fire core and Family
 
01:58:02.629 --> 01:58:02.639 align:start position:0%
Daycare means the same thing that's a
 
01:58:04.850 --> 01:58:04.860 align:start position:0%
win right if
 
01:58:07.669 --> 01:58:07.679 align:start position:0%
and if it's I don't know if it's I I
 
01:58:09.770 --> 01:58:09.780 align:start position:0%
would refute that notion it's not a win
 
01:58:13.070 --> 01:58:13.080 align:start position:0%
if it constrains the supply of child
 
01:58:13.080 --> 01:58:14.229 align:start position:0%
if it constrains the supply of child
care

01:58:14.229 --> 01:58:14.239 align:start position:0%
care
 
01:58:14.239 --> 01:58:16.070 align:start position:0%
care
accessibility

01:58:16.070 --> 01:58:16.080 align:start position:0%
accessibility
 
01:58:18.470 --> 01:58:18.480 align:start position:0%
for the purpose of making things the
 
01:58:20.870 --> 01:58:20.880 align:start position:0%
same name I would my personal preference
 
01:58:22.910 --> 01:58:22.920 align:start position:0%
and I totally hear what you're saying um
 
01:58:26.390 --> 01:58:26.400 align:start position:0%
Marshall yeah and and I get it but it's
 
01:58:29.750 --> 01:58:29.760 align:start position:0%
it comes the argument that I believe is
 
01:58:32.089 --> 01:58:32.099 align:start position:0%
being bestowed is that it's it will
 
01:58:33.530 --> 01:58:33.540 align:start position:0%
confuse people less when they're trying
 
01:58:35.689 --> 01:58:35.699 align:start position:0%
to start their Center but I would rather
 
01:58:37.550 --> 01:58:37.560 align:start position:0%
there be some confusion and allow them
 
01:58:39.290 --> 01:58:39.300 align:start position:0%
to have 15
 
01:58:40.850 --> 01:58:40.860 align:start position:0%
um then just cap them down at 12 when
 
01:58:43.370 --> 01:58:43.380 align:start position:0%
they can safely have 15.
 
01:58:45.649 --> 01:58:45.659 align:start position:0%
um because it's just we're just not in a
 
01:58:48.109 --> 01:58:48.119 align:start position:0%
situation in the state right now to cut
 
01:58:51.169 --> 01:58:51.179 align:start position:0%
any supply of child care if they can
 
01:58:54.410 --> 01:58:54.420 align:start position:0%
safely be in that home and that's 13
 
01:58:57.410 --> 01:58:57.420 align:start position:0%
right I don't want a waiver issued I
 
01:58:59.629 --> 01:58:59.639 align:start position:0%
want it to be by right I don't want it
 
01:59:00.770 --> 01:59:00.780 align:start position:0%
to be
 
01:59:02.629 --> 01:59:02.639 align:start position:0%
um and and I get I get the alignment
 
01:59:04.129 --> 01:59:04.139 align:start position:0%
argument I totally get it it's it's
 
01:59:05.570 --> 01:59:05.580 align:start position:0%
would be less confusing you are 100
 
01:59:08.450 --> 01:59:08.460 align:start position:0%
right I just don't think it's worth it I
 
01:59:10.850 --> 01:59:10.860 align:start position:0%
I rather there be some confusion and
 
01:59:12.350 --> 01:59:12.360 align:start position:0%
have more
 
01:59:15.530 --> 01:59:15.540 align:start position:0%
supply of child care because you know we
 
01:59:16.729 --> 01:59:16.739 align:start position:0%
could have that argument in five years
 
01:59:18.709 --> 01:59:18.719 align:start position:0%
if the market had stabilized
 
01:59:20.089 --> 01:59:20.099 align:start position:0%
um and then maybe be like yeah but we
 
01:59:21.530 --> 01:59:21.540 align:start position:0%
are we all agreed like in the opening
 
01:59:22.910 --> 01:59:22.920 align:start position:0%
style that we're in a crisis right now
 
01:59:25.070 --> 01:59:25.080 align:start position:0%
that moms can't find cares for their
 
01:59:27.290 --> 01:59:27.300 align:start position:0%
infants and the idea that we're going to
 
01:59:30.290 --> 01:59:30.300 align:start position:0%
potentially limit the supply
 
01:59:30.300 --> 01:59:31.010 align:start position:0%
potentially limit the supply
um

01:59:31.010 --> 01:59:31.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:59:33.950 --> 01:59:33.960 align:start position:0%
so that things can be not as confusing
 
01:59:36.350 --> 01:59:36.360 align:start position:0%
it just it just doesn't the art it's
 
01:59:37.970 --> 01:59:37.980 align:start position:0%
just I get the argument it's not it's in
 
01:59:40.490 --> 01:59:40.500 align:start position:0%
a valid argument to make it's just the
 
01:59:42.830 --> 01:59:42.840 align:start position:0%
the good doesn't outweigh the bad if you
 
01:59:44.570 --> 01:59:44.580 align:start position:0%
see what I'm saying oh yeah I get you I
 
01:59:46.370 --> 01:59:46.380 align:start position:0%
guess I'd ask maybe Melissa to come up
 
01:59:47.750 --> 01:59:47.760 align:start position:0%
and talk about the specifics of the
 
01:59:49.370 --> 01:59:49.380 align:start position:0%
different license categories because I
 
01:59:50.870 --> 01:59:50.880 align:start position:0%
think that
 
01:59:50.880 --> 01:59:51.470 align:start position:0%
think that
um

01:59:51.470 --> 01:59:51.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:59:53.810 --> 01:59:53.820 align:start position:0%
you know one of the things that
 
01:59:57.169 --> 01:59:57.179 align:start position:0%
we can almost put a daycare is in a
 
01:59:58.790 --> 01:59:58.800 align:start position:0%
bunch of different places right it's
 
02:00:00.770 --> 02:00:00.780 align:start position:0%
just a for us it's the numbers we need
 
02:00:03.350 --> 02:00:03.360 align:start position:0%
those thresholds as I think as you are
 
02:00:05.330 --> 02:00:05.340 align:start position:0%
alluding to right if I have a hundred
 
02:00:07.010 --> 02:00:07.020 align:start position:0%
people in a space versus a thousand
 
02:00:08.270 --> 02:00:08.280 align:start position:0%
people in the space there's going to be
 
02:00:10.310 --> 02:00:10.320 align:start position:0%
different requirements right if I have
 
02:00:10.320 --> 02:00:11.629 align:start position:0%
different requirements right if I have
uh

02:00:11.629 --> 02:00:11.639 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:00:13.550 --> 02:00:13.560 align:start position:0%
um a daycare facility that's a wood
 
02:00:15.169 --> 02:00:15.179 align:start position:0%
frame building like our typical homes
 
02:00:17.089 --> 02:00:17.099 align:start position:0%
and you're on the first floor you're
 
02:00:18.350 --> 02:00:18.360 align:start position:0%
probably fine but when you have a
 
02:00:19.970 --> 02:00:19.980 align:start position:0%
three-story wood frame building you're
 
02:00:21.770 --> 02:00:21.780 align:start position:0%
putting your kids on the third floor we
 
02:00:22.790 --> 02:00:22.800 align:start position:0%
want it to be different because it's
 
02:00:24.410 --> 02:00:24.420 align:start position:0%
going to take longer you know longer for
 
02:00:25.850 --> 02:00:25.860 align:start position:0%
them to get out and the fire is going to
 
02:00:28.370 --> 02:00:28.380 align:start position:0%
move rapidly and things like that so we
 
02:00:30.530 --> 02:00:30.540 align:start position:0%
we just need those different thresholds
 
02:00:34.550 --> 02:00:34.560 align:start position:0%
to help Define the all the requirements
 
02:00:35.810 --> 02:00:35.820 align:start position:0%
um yeah if I just responding real fast
 
02:00:37.910 --> 02:00:37.920 align:start position:0%
then I'll let you hear um and I I don't
 
02:00:39.290 --> 02:00:39.300 align:start position:0%
speaking I can't speak the entire
 
02:00:40.550 --> 02:00:40.560 align:start position:0%
committee but I don't think anybody up
 
02:00:41.689 --> 02:00:41.699 align:start position:0%
here would agree with anything you just
 
02:00:41.699 --> 02:00:42.830 align:start position:0%
here would agree with anything you just
said

02:00:42.830 --> 02:00:42.840 align:start position:0%
said
 
02:00:44.689 --> 02:00:44.699 align:start position:0%
um I I think our disagreement would be
 
02:00:48.109 --> 02:00:48.119 align:start position:0%
just using DHHS to cap them down if if
 
02:00:49.910 --> 02:00:49.920 align:start position:0%
you use the fire marshal say hey this
 
02:00:51.410 --> 02:00:51.420 align:start position:0%
isn't safe you can't do this even though
 
02:00:53.629 --> 02:00:53.639 align:start position:0%
the DHHS license allows for it
 
02:00:55.609 --> 02:00:55.619 align:start position:0%
you can't do it it's not safe and nobody
 
02:00:58.609 --> 02:00:58.619 align:start position:0%
appears nobody here I I can't say nobody
 
02:00:59.629 --> 02:00:59.639 align:start position:0%
up here is going to disagree with you
 
02:00:59.639 --> 02:01:00.589 align:start position:0%
up here is going to disagree with you
right

02:01:00.589 --> 02:01:00.599 align:start position:0%
right
 
02:01:02.810 --> 02:01:02.820 align:start position:0%
um but if the fire if it is safe for
 
02:01:05.870 --> 02:01:05.880 align:start position:0%
them to be in there to cap down the DHHS
 
02:01:05.880 --> 02:01:07.910 align:start position:0%
them to be in there to cap down the DHHS
license

02:01:07.910 --> 02:01:07.920 align:start position:0%
license
 
02:01:11.810 --> 02:01:11.820 align:start position:0%
for the purposes of alignment just seems
 
02:01:14.330 --> 02:01:14.340 align:start position:0%
it it just doesn't see it just doesn't
 
02:01:16.010 --> 02:01:16.020 align:start position:0%
sit well with me anyways representative
 
02:01:17.810 --> 02:01:17.820 align:start position:0%
you want to go and I had to get that off
 
02:01:20.209 --> 02:01:20.219 align:start position:0%
my my brain before but thank you no I
 
02:01:22.070 --> 02:01:22.080 align:start position:0%
guess my only question was in my
 
02:01:23.870 --> 02:01:23.880 align:start position:0%
understanding of what this bill is
 
02:01:26.149 --> 02:01:26.159 align:start position:0%
intending to do it's intending to open
 
02:01:28.370 --> 02:01:28.380 align:start position:0%
up more buildings that are already you
 
02:01:30.290 --> 02:01:30.300 align:start position:0%
know commercial and probably are already
 
02:01:33.350 --> 02:01:33.360 align:start position:0%
Meeting those higher requirements so I
 
02:01:34.550 --> 02:01:34.560 align:start position:0%
guess I
 
02:01:38.149 --> 02:01:38.159 align:start position:0%
don't see it as super concerning I see
 
02:01:41.209 --> 02:01:41.219 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:43.430 --> 02:01:43.440 align:start position:0%
so if I could just propose splitting you
 
02:01:45.290 --> 02:01:45.300 align:start position:0%
know finding some Middle Ground here I
 
02:01:46.669 --> 02:01:46.679 align:start position:0%
think we can probably find Middle Ground
 
02:01:50.530 --> 02:01:50.540 align:start position:0%
if we were to keep in the two stricken
 
02:01:53.450 --> 02:01:53.460 align:start position:0%
pieces we would be calling a family
 
02:01:55.129 --> 02:01:55.139 align:start position:0%
daycare home and I think Melissa
 
02:01:56.330 --> 02:01:56.340 align:start position:0%
probably will come up for this
 
02:01:57.649 --> 02:01:57.659 align:start position:0%
discussion but I want to get your take
 
02:01:59.810 --> 02:01:59.820 align:start position:0%
on it before you leave the witness stand
 
02:02:01.790 --> 02:02:01.800 align:start position:0%
we would be calling Family Daycare home
 
02:02:04.729 --> 02:02:04.739 align:start position:0%
six children with the ability to flex to
 
02:02:06.050 --> 02:02:06.060 align:start position:0%
nine so when you're doing your
 
02:02:07.790 --> 02:02:07.800 align:start position:0%
inspection for a family daycare home
 
02:02:10.250 --> 02:02:10.260 align:start position:0%
you're inspecting for nine occupancy and
 
02:02:11.570 --> 02:02:11.580 align:start position:0%
then you would be saying family group
 
02:02:13.550 --> 02:02:13.560 align:start position:0%
daycare home would be 12 children with
 
02:02:16.070 --> 02:02:16.080 align:start position:0%
the ability to flex to 17 so your
 
02:02:18.830 --> 02:02:18.840 align:start position:0%
inspection is 417 children does that
 
02:02:20.629 --> 02:02:20.639 align:start position:0%
make sense to you would that be sort of
 
02:02:22.790 --> 02:02:22.800 align:start position:0%
a logical way to do the checklist yeah I
 
02:02:25.070 --> 02:02:25.080 align:start position:0%
mean for us it would be looking at is
 
02:02:26.810 --> 02:02:26.820 align:start position:0%
the Family Daycare home in the group
 
02:02:28.070 --> 02:02:28.080 align:start position:0%
daycare home would be just a little bit
 
02:02:29.450 --> 02:02:29.460 align:start position:0%
different for us that's all that's
 
02:02:31.070 --> 02:02:31.080 align:start position:0%
really what it would I mean from a fire
 
02:02:32.750 --> 02:02:32.760 align:start position:0%
code official that's
 
02:02:34.550 --> 02:02:34.560 align:start position:0%
that's what it would be like if we were
 
02:02:38.330 --> 02:02:38.340 align:start position:0%
at 17 I think I heard it would be uh it
 
02:02:41.750 --> 02:02:41.760 align:start position:0%
would be a daycare occupancy not a not a
 
02:02:44.330 --> 02:02:44.340 align:start position:0%
daycare a home per se that's all
 
02:02:46.189 --> 02:02:46.199 align:start position:0%
right in our world change the definition
 
02:02:49.310 --> 02:02:49.320 align:start position:0%
of family group daycare home 12 with the
 
02:02:51.830 --> 02:02:51.840 align:start position:0%
ability to flex to 17. right so that the
 
02:02:54.050 --> 02:02:54.060 align:start position:0%
fire inspection is for 17. right under
 
02:02:55.910 --> 02:02:55.920 align:start position:0%
the category of a family group daycare
 
02:02:55.920 --> 02:02:56.810 align:start position:0%
the category of a family group daycare
home

02:02:56.810 --> 02:02:56.820 align:start position:0%
home
 
02:03:00.290 --> 02:03:00.300 align:start position:0%
I I let the HHS figure out the naming of
 
02:03:02.689 --> 02:03:02.699 align:start position:0%
them your inspections you could have a
 
02:03:04.430 --> 02:03:04.440 align:start position:0%
checklist based on those occupancy
 
02:03:06.109 --> 02:03:06.119 align:start position:0%
numbers yeah it would still be okay and
 
02:03:08.450 --> 02:03:08.460 align:start position:0%
if they don't meet 17 they may only end
 
02:03:10.129 --> 02:03:10.139 align:start position:0%
up at 15 and that's what they're
 
02:03:11.810 --> 02:03:11.820 align:start position:0%
licensed for and everyone agrees that
 
02:03:13.609 --> 02:03:13.619 align:start position:0%
although the statute may allow them to
 
02:03:15.589 --> 02:03:15.599 align:start position:0%
go up to 17 their property doesn't allow
 
02:03:17.270 --> 02:03:17.280 align:start position:0%
that due to other constraints and so
 
02:03:19.729 --> 02:03:19.739 align:start position:0%
they're only licensed up to 15 and so
 
02:03:21.890 --> 02:03:21.900 align:start position:0%
it's really 12 but they could Flex three
 
02:03:24.169 --> 02:03:24.179 align:start position:0%
more under their conditions okay all
 
02:03:25.310 --> 02:03:25.320 align:start position:0%
right I think that there's a way to make
 
02:03:26.330 --> 02:03:26.340 align:start position:0%
this work
 
02:03:31.010 --> 02:03:31.020 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:31.020 --> 02:03:33.229 align:start position:0%
 
representative

02:03:33.229 --> 02:03:33.239 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:03:38.709 --> 02:03:38.719 align:start position:0%
at 17 as the family child care provider
 
02:03:41.750 --> 02:03:41.760 align:start position:0%
flipped over into an area that is a lot
 
02:03:43.370 --> 02:03:43.380 align:start position:0%
more restrictive
 
02:03:45.950 --> 02:03:45.960 align:start position:0%
so that they're now meeting them having
 
02:03:48.530 --> 02:03:48.540 align:start position:0%
to meet the requirements as would a
 
02:03:52.310 --> 02:03:52.320 align:start position:0%
center with 50. yes so yeah I mean
 
02:03:54.229 --> 02:03:54.239 align:start position:0%
there's a couple of I mean the hard part
 
02:03:56.750 --> 02:03:56.760 align:start position:0%
with the codes right is there's a lot of
 
02:03:58.609 --> 02:03:58.619 align:start position:0%
like what-ifs and exceptions and things
 
02:04:01.790 --> 02:04:01.800 align:start position:0%
like that but um the you know you're
 
02:04:03.770 --> 02:04:03.780 align:start position:0%
looking at maybe a sprinkler system
 
02:04:05.270 --> 02:04:05.280 align:start position:0%
depending on where and how the
 
02:04:08.030 --> 02:04:08.040 align:start position:0%
building's constructed and uh what level
 
02:04:09.830 --> 02:04:09.840 align:start position:0%
the floor what level what floor level
 
02:04:11.870 --> 02:04:11.880 align:start position:0%
they're on maybe a fire alarm a
 
02:04:13.189 --> 02:04:13.199 align:start position:0%
commercial fire alarm system like we
 
02:04:15.169 --> 02:04:15.179 align:start position:0%
have in this building not the you know
 
02:04:16.550 --> 02:04:16.560 align:start position:0%
in a home we're just we want smoke
 
02:04:18.470 --> 02:04:18.480 align:start position:0%
alarms and things like that so that yes
 
02:04:20.990 --> 02:04:21.000 align:start position:0%
as you there's there's changes that
 
02:04:22.550 --> 02:04:22.560 align:start position:0%
could be impacted the sprinklers
 
02:04:23.990 --> 02:04:24.000 align:start position:0%
probably is probably the is the biggest
 
02:04:26.629 --> 02:04:26.639 align:start position:0%
one we hear when you get into
 
02:04:29.149 --> 02:04:29.159 align:start position:0%
upper level Upper Floor levels and wood
 
02:04:30.709 --> 02:04:30.719 align:start position:0%
frame construction which is our the
 
02:04:32.270 --> 02:04:32.280 align:start position:0%
predominant construction type in our
 
02:04:32.280 --> 02:04:33.050 align:start position:0%
predominant construction type in our
area

02:04:33.050 --> 02:04:33.060 align:start position:0%
area
 
02:04:34.729 --> 02:04:34.739 align:start position:0%
and I think that's a business decision
 
02:04:37.010 --> 02:04:37.020 align:start position:0%
that that provider has to make and if
 
02:04:38.990 --> 02:04:39.000 align:start position:0%
they want to put all that in their
 
02:04:41.570 --> 02:04:41.580 align:start position:0%
locality of municipality allows for it I
 
02:04:43.070 --> 02:04:43.080 align:start position:0%
just don't want the DHHS license to
 
02:04:44.810 --> 02:04:44.820 align:start position:0%
restrict it
 
02:04:47.450 --> 02:04:47.460 align:start position:0%
I have another question could you tell
 
02:04:49.570 --> 02:04:49.580 align:start position:0%
me how long
 
02:04:49.580 --> 02:04:51.229 align:start position:0%
me how long
has

02:04:51.229 --> 02:04:51.239 align:start position:0%
has
 
02:04:53.570 --> 02:04:53.580 align:start position:0%
um this definition
 
02:04:58.550 --> 02:04:58.560 align:start position:0%
been in place for how many years I on in
 
02:05:01.189 --> 02:05:01.199 align:start position:0%
on the dhh side each side I have to ask
 
02:05:03.589 --> 02:05:03.599 align:start position:0%
ask my friends behind me
 
02:05:05.450 --> 02:05:05.460 align:start position:0%
um the fire code side I would suggest
 
02:05:07.250 --> 02:05:07.260 align:start position:0%
the stuff hasn't changed in quite some
 
02:05:07.260 --> 02:05:08.689 align:start position:0%
the stuff hasn't changed in quite some
time

02:05:08.689 --> 02:05:08.699 align:start position:0%
time
 
02:05:10.550 --> 02:05:10.560 align:start position:0%
um I could definitely look back but it's
 
02:05:13.070 --> 02:05:13.080 align:start position:0%
it's been it's been this way for quite a
 
02:05:15.770 --> 02:05:15.780 align:start position:0%
long time on the fire code
 
02:05:17.629 --> 02:05:17.639 align:start position:0%
does anyone else wish to lops and bombs
 
02:05:19.030 --> 02:05:19.040 align:start position:0%
at the fire marshal
 
02:05:21.830 --> 02:05:21.840 align:start position:0%
it's all good we don't get this very own
 
02:05:23.390 --> 02:05:23.400 align:start position:0%
all right um with that I think uh
 
02:05:25.070 --> 02:05:25.080 align:start position:0%
probably DHHS probably wants to come up
 
02:05:27.050 --> 02:05:27.060 align:start position:0%
and tell us why we're wrong and that's
 
02:05:29.450 --> 02:05:29.460 align:start position:0%
totally fine it's totally
 
02:05:31.310 --> 02:05:31.320 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you thank you uh Fire
 
02:05:31.320 --> 02:05:38.930 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you thank you uh Fire
Marshall

02:05:38.930 --> 02:05:38.940 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:40.609 --> 02:05:40.619 align:start position:0%
hello again
 
02:05:40.619 --> 02:05:42.050 align:start position:0%
hello again
so

02:05:42.050 --> 02:05:42.060 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:05:42.060 --> 02:05:43.430 align:start position:0%
so
for

02:05:43.430 --> 02:05:43.440 align:start position:0%
for
 
02:05:43.440 --> 02:05:45.350 align:start position:0%
for
our

02:05:45.350 --> 02:05:45.360 align:start position:0%
our
 
02:05:47.570 --> 02:05:47.580 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to like encapsulate
 
02:05:48.830 --> 02:05:48.840 align:start position:0%
everything that I've heard so far and
 
02:05:51.109 --> 02:05:51.119 align:start position:0%
hoping I'm providing a good response but
 
02:05:53.270 --> 02:05:53.280 align:start position:0%
obviously feel free to ask me for
 
02:05:56.330 --> 02:05:56.340 align:start position:0%
clarification so when looking at this
 
02:05:57.890 --> 02:05:57.900 align:start position:0%
we're asking for changes for family
 
02:06:01.550 --> 02:06:01.560 align:start position:0%
child care home which is limiting to six
 
02:06:03.589 --> 02:06:03.599 align:start position:0%
and then family group
 
02:06:08.270 --> 02:06:08.280 align:start position:0%
the anyone being if we allow this um
 
02:06:10.850 --> 02:06:10.860 align:start position:0%
exception where the current ones remain
 
02:06:13.370 --> 02:06:13.380 align:start position:0%
as is and then new people are limited
 
02:06:16.070 --> 02:06:16.080 align:start position:0%
based on the new statute it's not going
 
02:06:18.410 --> 02:06:18.420 align:start position:0%
to affect the family day care home that
 
02:06:20.750 --> 02:06:20.760 align:start position:0%
definition there's no effect because
 
02:06:23.149 --> 02:06:23.159 align:start position:0%
then if they're being approved for nine
 
02:06:24.350 --> 02:06:24.360 align:start position:0%
children they're going to be moved to
 
02:06:27.290 --> 02:06:27.300 align:start position:0%
family group daycare so as the fire
 
02:06:29.570 --> 02:06:29.580 align:start position:0%
inspectors are improving them their
 
02:06:30.649 --> 02:06:30.659 align:start position:0%
codes are going to they're going to be
 
02:06:31.910 --> 02:06:31.920 align:start position:0%
inspected at the same code because
 
02:06:34.129 --> 02:06:34.139 align:start position:0%
they're looking at 12 and under so
 
02:06:36.830 --> 02:06:36.840 align:start position:0%
there's no impact to Family Day Care
 
02:06:39.709 --> 02:06:39.719 align:start position:0%
any impact we might could have would be
 
02:06:41.450 --> 02:06:41.460 align:start position:0%
family group because they're the ones
 
02:06:44.149 --> 02:06:44.159 align:start position:0%
who will be capped at 12. the way it
 
02:06:48.229 --> 02:06:48.239 align:start position:0%
works now is we often have either the
 
02:06:51.530 --> 02:06:51.540 align:start position:0%
zoning office or the fire inspectors or
 
02:06:53.990 --> 02:06:54.000 align:start position:0%
the towns and the programs in the Life
 
02:06:56.750 --> 02:06:56.760 align:start position:0%
Safety Code inspector for the towns are
 
02:06:59.750 --> 02:06:59.760 align:start position:0%
confused about what they're being asked
 
02:07:02.689 --> 02:07:02.699 align:start position:0%
to approve because the code says they're
 
02:07:05.209 --> 02:07:05.219 align:start position:0%
12. they're in a you know they're in a
 
02:07:07.430 --> 02:07:07.440 align:start position:0%
home dwelling and then our rule says
 
02:07:09.770 --> 02:07:09.780 align:start position:0%
that this is a family group home so it's
 
02:07:11.689 --> 02:07:11.699 align:start position:0%
they're looking at a home so it is there
 
02:07:13.370 --> 02:07:13.380 align:start position:0%
is some confusion and there is things
 
02:07:14.930 --> 02:07:14.940 align:start position:0%
that we need to walk through for that
 
02:07:17.390 --> 02:07:17.400 align:start position:0%
there are also
 
02:07:17.400 --> 02:07:18.709 align:start position:0%
there are also
um

02:07:18.709 --> 02:07:18.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:07:21.410 --> 02:07:21.420 align:start position:0%
so I mean that was to speak to that part
 
02:07:23.270 --> 02:07:23.280 align:start position:0%
of it is that we're trying to make this
 
02:07:24.890 --> 02:07:24.900 align:start position:0%
process as smooth as possible because
 
02:07:27.950 --> 02:07:27.960 align:start position:0%
that is where the confusion comes up I
 
02:07:29.689 --> 02:07:29.699 align:start position:0%
had mentioned to representative Walnut
 
02:07:31.370 --> 02:07:31.380 align:start position:0%
earlier that I would like the ability to
 
02:07:33.410 --> 02:07:33.420 align:start position:0%
go back and see how many programs that
 
02:07:35.390 --> 02:07:35.400 align:start position:0%
we have been approving for more than 12
 
02:07:37.370 --> 02:07:37.380 align:start position:0%
in the recent years because that's
 
02:07:39.350 --> 02:07:39.360 align:start position:0%
happening less and less often due to
 
02:07:43.129 --> 02:07:43.139 align:start position:0%
town and local approvals so it seems to
 
02:07:45.709 --> 02:07:45.719 align:start position:0%
be that's already it's possible that
 
02:07:48.470 --> 02:07:48.480 align:start position:0%
it's already a constraint currently but
 
02:07:50.030 --> 02:07:50.040 align:start position:0%
we have so many programs that have been
 
02:07:52.970 --> 02:07:52.980 align:start position:0%
in existence for so long they may they
 
02:07:54.470 --> 02:07:54.480 align:start position:0%
because of previous rules they were
 
02:07:57.310 --> 02:07:57.320 align:start position:0%
allowed to do that so
 
02:08:01.070 --> 02:08:01.080 align:start position:0%
I would appreciate as the um State Fire
 
02:08:03.229 --> 02:08:03.239 align:start position:0%
Marshal of State Clarity on this because
 
02:08:05.330 --> 02:08:05.340 align:start position:0%
it is a process for providers to
 
02:08:07.070 --> 02:08:07.080 align:start position:0%
understand and they don't understand
 
02:08:08.750 --> 02:08:08.760 align:start position:0%
right now what it is that they need to
 
02:08:10.310 --> 02:08:10.320 align:start position:0%
get approvals for and how it needs to be
 
02:08:10.320 --> 02:08:12.910 align:start position:0%
get approvals for and how it needs to be
approved

02:08:12.910 --> 02:08:12.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:16.070 --> 02:08:16.080 align:start position:0%
representative walner
 
02:08:18.410 --> 02:08:18.420 align:start position:0%
how many how long do you think we've had
 
02:08:20.629 --> 02:08:20.639 align:start position:0%
this in law
 
02:08:23.990 --> 02:08:24.000 align:start position:0%
um I know the existence of 170e for
 
02:08:26.209 --> 02:08:26.219 align:start position:0%
child care that came in around 1990 I'm
 
02:08:28.129 --> 02:08:28.139 align:start position:0%
going to guess it's about the same time
 
02:08:29.510 --> 02:08:29.520 align:start position:0%
frame when those definitions were
 
02:08:31.370 --> 02:08:31.380 align:start position:0%
created I don't have the statute book in
 
02:08:33.589 --> 02:08:33.599 align:start position:0%
front of me I could refer to that but
 
02:08:35.510 --> 02:08:35.520 align:start position:0%
it's probably right around in that
 
02:08:44.109 --> 02:08:44.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:49.070 --> 02:08:49.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:52.370 --> 02:08:52.380 align:start position:0%
um I to your point so you say Family
 
02:08:54.649 --> 02:08:54.659 align:start position:0%
Daycare home won't be impacted but we
 
02:08:56.330 --> 02:08:56.340 align:start position:0%
could Impact Family Group daycare home
 
02:08:59.270 --> 02:08:59.280 align:start position:0%
yep and we currently have 38 that are
 
02:09:01.310 --> 02:09:01.320 align:start position:0%
licensed and there's fewer of those
 
02:09:03.350 --> 02:09:03.360 align:start position:0%
coming up
 
02:09:05.030 --> 02:09:05.040 align:start position:0%
restrictions that are placed because
 
02:09:06.470 --> 02:09:06.480 align:start position:0%
they're in neighborhoods these are
 
02:09:08.450 --> 02:09:08.460 align:start position:0%
residential and you said mostly due to
 
02:09:12.530 --> 02:09:12.540 align:start position:0%
Talent ordinances and it also there's an
 
02:09:12.540 --> 02:09:13.430 align:start position:0%
Talent ordinances and it also there's an
um

02:09:13.430 --> 02:09:13.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:09:15.589 --> 02:09:15.599 align:start position:0%
there's a ratio issue too where you're
 
02:09:17.570 --> 02:09:17.580 align:start position:0%
allowed you know when your family group
 
02:09:19.669 --> 02:09:19.679 align:start position:0%
you have two providers there are many
 
02:09:22.370 --> 02:09:22.380 align:start position:0%
towns that have
 
02:09:24.709 --> 02:09:24.719 align:start position:0%
um an ordinance where if you're in a
 
02:09:27.050 --> 02:09:27.060 align:start position:0%
residential area all of your employees
 
02:09:29.089 --> 02:09:29.099 align:start position:0%
need to live in your home so we've had
 
02:09:30.530 --> 02:09:30.540 align:start position:0%
people who've been constrained from
 
02:09:33.530 --> 02:09:33.540 align:start position:0%
becoming a family group because their
 
02:09:35.810 --> 02:09:35.820 align:start position:0%
worker that was going to be coming they
 
02:09:38.390 --> 02:09:38.400 align:start position:0%
don't live there so there there are
 
02:09:40.669 --> 02:09:40.679 align:start position:0%
other things that come into play here
 
02:09:42.890 --> 02:09:42.900 align:start position:0%
um that are limiting the family group
 
02:09:45.350 --> 02:09:45.360 align:start position:0%
it's it seems there's already limits
 
02:09:46.910 --> 02:09:46.920 align:start position:0%
there and we're just trying to align to
 
02:09:48.470 --> 02:09:48.480 align:start position:0%
make sure the fire inspections that are
 
02:09:50.870 --> 02:09:50.880 align:start position:0%
being done are the correct ones for the
 
02:09:52.729 --> 02:09:52.739 align:start position:0%
number of children the location where
 
02:09:53.990 --> 02:09:54.000 align:start position:0%
they are
 
02:09:57.050 --> 02:09:57.060 align:start position:0%
we have represent page just to
 
02:09:58.910 --> 02:09:58.920 align:start position:0%
just to make sure I'm following when we
 
02:10:01.010 --> 02:10:01.020 align:start position:0%
talk about it being confusing for the
 
02:10:04.310 --> 02:10:04.320 align:start position:0%
providers what it is they're asking for
 
02:10:05.450 --> 02:10:05.460 align:start position:0%
um do you think we could be in a
 
02:10:08.149 --> 02:10:08.159 align:start position:0%
situation where an inspector comes
 
02:10:10.129 --> 02:10:10.139 align:start position:0%
assuming that the facility is only ever
 
02:10:12.530 --> 02:10:12.540 align:start position:0%
going to have 12 children in it but that
 
02:10:14.570 --> 02:10:14.580 align:start position:0%
provider may actually be during the
 
02:10:16.609 --> 02:10:16.619 align:start position:0%
holidays taking 17 children and they've
 
02:10:18.109 --> 02:10:18.119 align:start position:0%
only been inspected as though their
 
02:10:19.430 --> 02:10:19.440 align:start position:0%
facility would never have that that
 
02:10:21.169 --> 02:10:21.179 align:start position:0%
capacity do you think that that is the
 
02:10:23.750 --> 02:10:23.760 align:start position:0%
situation that is that the the law is
 
02:10:25.970 --> 02:10:25.980 align:start position:0%
currently written is actually creating a
 
02:10:27.050 --> 02:10:27.060 align:start position:0%
problem there
 
02:10:28.970 --> 02:10:28.980 align:start position:0%
um I I'm hoping that doesn't happen
 
02:10:30.950 --> 02:10:30.960 align:start position:0%
because the fire inspection has to be
 
02:10:32.810 --> 02:10:32.820 align:start position:0%
done prior to us issuing the license and
 
02:10:34.370 --> 02:10:34.380 align:start position:0%
the fire inspector puts the maximum
 
02:10:36.290 --> 02:10:36.300 align:start position:0%
number of children that is allowed there
 
02:10:39.950 --> 02:10:39.960 align:start position:0%
so we cannot approve a license that goes
 
02:10:43.070 --> 02:10:43.080 align:start position:0%
beyond what the fire a fire inspector or
 
02:10:45.890 --> 02:10:45.900 align:start position:0%
a town has approved them for okay thank
 
02:10:47.930 --> 02:10:47.940 align:start position:0%
you that's helpful
 
02:10:51.649 --> 02:10:51.659 align:start position:0%
and your DHHS providers with a list of
 
02:10:54.470 --> 02:10:54.480 align:start position:0%
towns that do do that restriction I
 
02:10:56.149 --> 02:10:56.159 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be able to know
 
02:10:58.070 --> 02:10:58.080 align:start position:0%
um I know that I just saw in the news
 
02:10:59.390 --> 02:10:59.400 align:start position:0%
yesterday that there's a whole new
 
02:11:01.189 --> 02:11:01.199 align:start position:0%
zoning map out there I don't know if
 
02:11:03.410 --> 02:11:03.420 align:start position:0%
they have that was that information yeah
 
02:11:05.149 --> 02:11:05.159 align:start position:0%
that was for our friends on the special
 
02:11:06.890 --> 02:11:06.900 align:start position:0%
committee on housing
 
02:11:09.109 --> 02:11:09.119 align:start position:0%
um but I I think just kind of speaking
 
02:11:10.669 --> 02:11:10.679 align:start position:0%
out loud I probably wouldn't get
 
02:11:12.890 --> 02:11:12.900 align:start position:0%
unanimous approval on the uh from the
 
02:11:14.570 --> 02:11:14.580 align:start position:0%
committee on this but I might sponsor
 
02:11:16.010 --> 02:11:16.020 align:start position:0%
something that might just supersede that
 
02:11:19.370 --> 02:11:19.380 align:start position:0%
because that's uh
 
02:11:21.410 --> 02:11:21.420 align:start position:0%
that's uh well it's not even it's
 
02:11:23.270 --> 02:11:23.280 align:start position:0%
unfriendly to child care if you're gonna
 
02:11:27.290 --> 02:11:27.300 align:start position:0%
this I I I I view as you guys know I I
 
02:11:29.209 --> 02:11:29.219 align:start position:0%
own a license shocker so I own one of
 
02:11:30.410 --> 02:11:30.420 align:start position:0%
the bigger ones
 
02:11:33.470 --> 02:11:33.480 align:start position:0%
um I view Family Daycare and family
 
02:11:35.689 --> 02:11:35.699 align:start position:0%
group daycare home as one of the
 
02:11:37.910 --> 02:11:37.920 align:start position:0%
immediate relief valves for what we're
 
02:11:39.709 --> 02:11:39.719 align:start position:0%
experiencing now yeah um this is my
 
02:11:41.089 --> 02:11:41.099 align:start position:0%
personal view
 
02:11:44.930 --> 02:11:44.940 align:start position:0%
um and uh if if it's an issue where
 
02:11:46.970 --> 02:11:46.980 align:start position:0%
towns are going a little overboard on
 
02:11:49.010 --> 02:11:49.020 align:start position:0%
that um I have no problem trimming back
 
02:11:50.990 --> 02:11:51.000 align:start position:0%
the towns if it gets more mobs back in
 
02:11:53.089 --> 02:11:53.099 align:start position:0%
the workspace to overcome that three
 
02:11:55.370 --> 02:11:55.380 align:start position:0%
point one or three point nine percent uh
 
02:11:57.709 --> 02:11:57.719 align:start position:0%
drop off in a woman Workforce
 
02:11:59.030 --> 02:11:59.040 align:start position:0%
participation rate
 
02:12:00.169 --> 02:12:00.179 align:start position:0%
um so that's just that's just me
 
02:12:01.370 --> 02:12:01.380 align:start position:0%
speaking out loud on my personal
 
02:12:03.709 --> 02:12:03.719 align:start position:0%
opinions I wouldn't do it to this bill
 
02:12:05.030 --> 02:12:05.040 align:start position:0%
um because that would be a whole other
 
02:12:06.830 --> 02:12:06.840 align:start position:0%
can of worms but just you may see that
 
02:12:08.990 --> 02:12:09.000 align:start position:0%
coming from me in the fall just uh just
 
02:12:10.310 --> 02:12:10.320 align:start position:0%
an FYI
 
02:12:10.320 --> 02:12:11.149 align:start position:0%
an FYI
um

02:12:11.149 --> 02:12:11.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:12:14.930 --> 02:12:14.940 align:start position:0%
any other um questions before we um I
 
02:12:16.189 --> 02:12:16.199 align:start position:0%
will probably have five minutes of
 
02:12:17.930 --> 02:12:17.940 align:start position:0%
committee talk and then we'll I'll
 
02:12:19.310 --> 02:12:19.320 align:start position:0%
recess and we'll go over to those and
 
02:12:20.990 --> 02:12:21.000 align:start position:0%
get some steak tips
 
02:12:23.570 --> 02:12:23.580 align:start position:0%
uh any questions for Miss Clement
 
02:12:25.550 --> 02:12:25.560 align:start position:0%
thank you all right thank you um does
 
02:12:27.169 --> 02:12:27.179 align:start position:0%
anybody have any any of the committee
 
02:12:28.729 --> 02:12:28.739 align:start position:0%
members have any thoughts they wish to
 
02:12:28.739 --> 02:12:32.089 align:start position:0%
members have any thoughts they wish to
share

02:12:32.089 --> 02:12:32.099 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:36.350 --> 02:12:36.360 align:start position:0%
okay great uh all right um we I will uh
 
02:12:38.990 --> 02:12:39.000 align:start position:0%
I'll see you guys next
 
02:12:41.750 --> 02:12:41.760 align:start position:0%
um next Wednesday at 10 A.M I'll look
 
02:12:44.450 --> 02:12:44.460 align:start position:0%
forward to the amendment from
 
02:12:46.370 --> 02:12:46.380 align:start position:0%
representative McWilliams
 
02:12:48.350 --> 02:12:48.360 align:start position:0%
um and I will probably bring forward an
 
02:12:48.360 --> 02:12:49.550 align:start position:0%
um and I will probably bring forward an
amendment

02:12:49.550 --> 02:12:49.560 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
02:12:52.430 --> 02:12:52.440 align:start position:0%
um to bring back the language
 
02:12:52.440 --> 02:12:53.330 align:start position:0%
um to bring back the language
um

02:12:53.330 --> 02:12:53.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:12:54.950 --> 02:12:54.960 align:start position:0%
and we can discuss it I'll probably
 
02:12:57.290 --> 02:12:57.300 align:start position:0%
bring forward two amendments oh I'm
 
02:12:58.790 --> 02:12:58.800 align:start position:0%
sorry you're fine we're not adjourned
 
02:13:03.530 --> 02:13:03.540 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:04.910 --> 02:13:04.920 align:start position:0%
you're fine just make sure you press the
 
02:13:07.250 --> 02:13:07.260 align:start position:0%
silver button okay so um for those of
 
02:13:09.109 --> 02:13:09.119 align:start position:0%
you who I don't know I'm Dorian Shockley
 
02:13:10.850 --> 02:13:10.860 align:start position:0%
the manager of the Bureau of Licensing
 
02:13:12.890 --> 02:13:12.900 align:start position:0%
and certification at the department and
 
02:13:14.390 --> 02:13:14.400 align:start position:0%
I just want to clarify something because
 
02:13:16.669 --> 02:13:16.679 align:start position:0%
I mean everything that you're mentioning
 
02:13:18.410 --> 02:13:18.420 align:start position:0%
is very important
 
02:13:21.109 --> 02:13:21.119 align:start position:0%
um if we were to unstrike I just it's
 
02:13:23.450 --> 02:13:23.460 align:start position:0%
been in existence since 1991 but it's
 
02:13:25.609 --> 02:13:25.619 align:start position:0%
not what's happening in practice and I
 
02:13:27.229 --> 02:13:27.239 align:start position:0%
think that's the distinction that's not
 
02:13:27.239 --> 02:13:28.609 align:start position:0%
think that's the distinction that's not
clear

02:13:28.609 --> 02:13:28.619 align:start position:0%
clear
 
02:13:32.209 --> 02:13:32.219 align:start position:0%
um when we don't give a license based on
 
02:13:34.430 --> 02:13:34.440 align:start position:0%
our rules we give a license based on
 
02:13:36.290 --> 02:13:36.300 align:start position:0%
what the locals approve for the
 
02:13:38.870 --> 02:13:38.880 align:start position:0%
occupancy and the locals are approving
 
02:13:41.569 --> 02:13:41.579 align:start position:0%
to the revised language if they're not
 
02:13:43.970 --> 02:13:43.980 align:start position:0%
they're not allowing those three or six
 
02:13:47.089 --> 02:13:47.099 align:start position:0%
or extra if the if the code doesn't
 
02:13:48.950 --> 02:13:48.960 align:start position:0%
require it so I think that's a
 
02:13:50.450 --> 02:13:50.460 align:start position:0%
distinction that needs to be really
 
02:13:53.629 --> 02:13:53.639 align:start position:0%
clear this this amendment these changes
 
02:13:57.050 --> 02:13:57.060 align:start position:0%
are actually not only aligning our rules
 
02:13:59.089 --> 02:13:59.099 align:start position:0%
with the codes but they're now putting
 
02:14:01.490 --> 02:14:01.500 align:start position:0%
into practice the reality of the
 
02:14:03.470 --> 02:14:03.480 align:start position:0%
environment so I think that's an
 
02:14:05.270 --> 02:14:05.280 align:start position:0%
important distinction that I think the
 
02:14:07.310 --> 02:14:07.320 align:start position:0%
committee needs to know
 
02:14:09.109 --> 02:14:09.119 align:start position:0%
all right
 
02:14:11.390 --> 02:14:11.400 align:start position:0%
um well on that bombshell we'll close
 
02:14:14.930 --> 02:14:14.940 align:start position:0%
the uh we'll close uh the um the work
 
02:14:16.729 --> 02:14:16.739 align:start position:0%
session and I hope to see as many you
 
02:14:18.649 --> 02:14:18.659 align:start position:0%
over at O's as possible and you see me
 
02:14:20.870 --> 02:14:20.880 align:start position:0%
running over there next
 
02:14:23.330 --> 02:14:23.340 align:start position:0%
it's actually Hotel Concord just to be
 
02:14:24.830 --> 02:14:24.840 align:start position:0%
clear Hotel Concord which is actually
 
02:14:34.089 --> 02:14:34.099 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:36.589 --> 02:14:36.599 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:14:36.599 --> 02:14:39.079 align:start position:0%
thank you
