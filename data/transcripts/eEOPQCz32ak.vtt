00:09:27.070 --> 00:09:27.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:29.990 --> 00:09:30.000 align:start position:0%
good morning
 
00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:37.490 align:start position:0%
good morning
ready

00:09:37.490 --> 00:09:37.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:40.970 --> 00:09:40.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:43.250 --> 00:09:43.260 align:start position:0%
we will now open up the public hearing
 
00:09:46.070 --> 00:09:46.080 align:start position:0%
on Senate Bill 49 and recognize the
 
00:09:47.690 --> 00:09:47.700 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor Senator Tim Lang welcome
 
00:09:49.970 --> 00:09:49.980 align:start position:0%
to Ways and Means thank you members of
 
00:09:51.530 --> 00:09:51.540 align:start position:0%
ways and means and again this is still
 
00:09:52.790 --> 00:09:52.800 align:start position:0%
my favorite committee you can tell by
 
00:09:54.410 --> 00:09:54.420 align:start position:0%
how much time I'm spending here and I'm
 
00:09:56.509 --> 00:09:56.519 align:start position:0%
still a state senator as as I was
 
00:09:56.519 --> 00:09:57.829 align:start position:0%
still a state senator as as I was
earlier

00:09:57.829 --> 00:09:57.839 align:start position:0%
earlier
 
00:09:59.509 --> 00:09:59.519 align:start position:0%
um this bill in front of you Senate Bill
 
00:10:01.790 --> 00:10:01.800 align:start position:0%
49 is a pretty straightforward bill it
 
00:10:03.350 --> 00:10:03.360 align:start position:0%
came out of a study committee that
 
00:10:04.850 --> 00:10:04.860 align:start position:0%
representative ulrey and I served on
 
00:10:07.910 --> 00:10:07.920 align:start position:0%
from last year in Senate Bill 330 that
 
00:10:10.190 --> 00:10:10.200 align:start position:0%
looked at oplc there were three bills
 
00:10:11.810 --> 00:10:11.820 align:start position:0%
that were generated out of that study
 
00:10:14.150 --> 00:10:14.160 align:start position:0%
committee this being one of them
 
00:10:16.550 --> 00:10:16.560 align:start position:0%
um the idea was as many of you know that
 
00:10:19.130 --> 00:10:19.140 align:start position:0%
we have that 125 percent rule relative
 
00:10:21.110 --> 00:10:21.120 align:start position:0%
to fees that are charged that would not
 
00:10:24.110 --> 00:10:24.120 align:start position:0%
allow that we're supposed to recover our
 
00:10:27.350 --> 00:10:27.360 align:start position:0%
costs and up to and 25 more but not more
 
00:10:29.269 --> 00:10:29.279 align:start position:0%
than that or the the Supreme Court's
 
00:10:33.230 --> 00:10:33.240 align:start position:0%
rule that it's a tax versus a fee and so
 
00:10:36.410 --> 00:10:36.420 align:start position:0%
in oplc we ran into the issue where uh
 
00:10:38.230 --> 00:10:38.240 align:start position:0%
licensing fees that we were covering
 
00:10:41.389 --> 00:10:41.399 align:start position:0%
were exceeding the amount of expenditure
 
00:10:44.449 --> 00:10:44.459 align:start position:0%
and we were elapsing money back into the
 
00:10:47.389 --> 00:10:47.399 align:start position:0%
general fund so in 2019 we lapsed 3.4
 
00:10:50.569 --> 00:10:50.579 align:start position:0%
million in 2000 2020 we lapsed three
 
00:10:53.509 --> 00:10:53.519 align:start position:0%
thousand a 3.3 million twenty one we
 
00:10:56.389 --> 00:10:56.399 align:start position:0%
lapsed 4.1 and this year we lapsed where
 
00:10:59.750 --> 00:10:59.760 align:start position:0%
uh we allowed well in 22 was 2.6 so
 
00:11:01.550 --> 00:11:01.560 align:start position:0%
every year we're lapsing monies back to
 
00:11:03.530 --> 00:11:03.540 align:start position:0%
the general fund but the idea behind a
 
00:11:06.050 --> 00:11:06.060 align:start position:0%
fee is that it's supposed to go to serve
 
00:11:08.329 --> 00:11:08.339 align:start position:0%
the person who paid the fee and this is
 
00:11:10.009 --> 00:11:10.019 align:start position:0%
going to general fund Monies to use for
 
00:11:11.990 --> 00:11:12.000 align:start position:0%
whatever this legislature decides and
 
00:11:14.509 --> 00:11:14.519 align:start position:0%
not the person who paid the fee so the
 
00:11:16.370 --> 00:11:16.380 align:start position:0%
idea behind this bill is to make sure
 
00:11:18.410 --> 00:11:18.420 align:start position:0%
that fees go back to help the person
 
00:11:19.910 --> 00:11:19.920 align:start position:0%
paying the fee in this case the
 
00:11:22.790 --> 00:11:22.800 align:start position:0%
licensees so that if this if the agency
 
00:11:24.710 --> 00:11:24.720 align:start position:0%
collects more money than an anticipator
 
00:11:26.690 --> 00:11:26.700 align:start position:0%
that will use any excess money to lower
 
00:11:30.170 --> 00:11:30.180 align:start position:0%
the cost of licenses not to just fund
 
00:11:32.329 --> 00:11:32.339 align:start position:0%
the general fund so that's the short
 
00:11:34.310 --> 00:11:34.320 align:start position:0%
version of the bill the how the Senate
 
00:11:36.290 --> 00:11:36.300 align:start position:0%
amended this my original Bill to add a
 
00:11:38.870 --> 00:11:38.880 align:start position:0%
reporting requirement the idea that we
 
00:11:40.610 --> 00:11:40.620 align:start position:0%
had when when I put this bill forward
 
00:11:43.190 --> 00:11:43.200 align:start position:0%
was that I was expecting the commission
 
00:11:45.889 --> 00:11:45.899 align:start position:0%
of oplc to put basically a 10-year plan
 
00:11:47.750 --> 00:11:47.760 align:start position:0%
out right is that this is what we expect
 
00:11:50.389 --> 00:11:50.399 align:start position:0%
to kind of spend money on in the next 10
 
00:11:52.850 --> 00:11:52.860 align:start position:0%
years and so just like in all of our
 
00:11:54.530 --> 00:11:54.540 align:start position:0%
cities towns school districts we have
 
00:11:56.150 --> 00:11:56.160 align:start position:0%
capital reserve funds that we put money
 
00:11:57.290 --> 00:11:57.300 align:start position:0%
in because we know we've got a roofing
 
00:11:58.970 --> 00:11:58.980 align:start position:0%
project or something like that that the
 
00:12:01.670 --> 00:12:01.680 align:start position:0%
idea this Reserve fund would bet they
 
00:12:03.170 --> 00:12:03.180 align:start position:0%
would be able to slowly build upon if
 
00:12:04.670 --> 00:12:04.680 align:start position:0%
they knew they were going to be doing a
 
00:12:06.590 --> 00:12:06.600 align:start position:0%
large multi-million dollar expenditure
 
00:12:09.530 --> 00:12:09.540 align:start position:0%
or even smaller projects million dollar
 
00:12:11.090 --> 00:12:11.100 align:start position:0%
expenditures but over the next five or
 
00:12:12.949 --> 00:12:12.959 align:start position:0%
six years they could plan for those
 
00:12:15.650 --> 00:12:15.660 align:start position:0%
expenditures and not create spiking in
 
00:12:17.329 --> 00:12:17.339 align:start position:0%
fees where all of a sudden they've got
 
00:12:19.790 --> 00:12:19.800 align:start position:0%
to do an Erp uh enterprise resource
 
00:12:22.310 --> 00:12:22.320 align:start position:0%
planning upgrade software upgrade that's
 
00:12:24.350 --> 00:12:24.360 align:start position:0%
a five million dollar bump and because
 
00:12:25.730 --> 00:12:25.740 align:start position:0%
they're self-funded they've got to go
 
00:12:27.530 --> 00:12:27.540 align:start position:0%
raise everybody's fees to cover the five
 
00:12:28.970 --> 00:12:28.980 align:start position:0%
million dollars we didn't want to do
 
00:12:30.590 --> 00:12:30.600 align:start position:0%
that where we create a spike in the fee
 
00:12:32.569 --> 00:12:32.579 align:start position:0%
and then we drop it back down so the
 
00:12:34.670 --> 00:12:34.680 align:start position:0%
idea was to create this non-lapsing fund
 
00:12:36.470 --> 00:12:36.480 align:start position:0%
to allow them put money in identify
 
00:12:39.650 --> 00:12:39.660 align:start position:0%
their 10-year plan and then execute use
 
00:12:41.449 --> 00:12:41.459 align:start position:0%
this funding for that 10-year plan
 
00:12:43.370 --> 00:12:43.380 align:start position:0%
without having to affect licensures and
 
00:12:45.530 --> 00:12:45.540 align:start position:0%
then also recognize that anything that
 
00:12:47.150 --> 00:12:47.160 align:start position:0%
wasn't needed for the 10-year plan would
 
00:12:50.750 --> 00:12:50.760 align:start position:0%
be used to lower licensure fees so that
 
00:12:52.370 --> 00:12:52.380 align:start position:0%
was the bill the Senate added the
 
00:12:54.290 --> 00:12:54.300 align:start position:0%
reporting requirement the house out of
 
00:12:57.470 --> 00:12:57.480 align:start position:0%
the cap I'm not a great fan of the cap
 
00:12:59.930 --> 00:12:59.940 align:start position:0%
um I I again my my I would like to see
 
00:13:01.910 --> 00:13:01.920 align:start position:0%
the director be able to put a 10-year
 
00:13:03.350 --> 00:13:03.360 align:start position:0%
plan together
 
00:13:05.329 --> 00:13:05.339 align:start position:0%
um and say that this is how we expect we
 
00:13:07.250 --> 00:13:07.260 align:start position:0%
might be using some of these funds that
 
00:13:09.170 --> 00:13:09.180 align:start position:0%
would define the cap and then if we
 
00:13:10.490 --> 00:13:10.500 align:start position:0%
wanted to come back and put a cap on
 
00:13:12.050 --> 00:13:12.060 align:start position:0%
after she's had the opportunity to do
 
00:13:15.350 --> 00:13:15.360 align:start position:0%
that I think that would be smart but the
 
00:13:16.670 --> 00:13:16.680 align:start position:0%
house chose to put the three million
 
00:13:18.050 --> 00:13:18.060 align:start position:0%
dollar cap on which is I think what you
 
00:13:19.670 --> 00:13:19.680 align:start position:0%
did with your version of this bill as
 
00:13:22.670 --> 00:13:22.680 align:start position:0%
well but I my preference is not to have
 
00:13:24.350 --> 00:13:24.360 align:start position:0%
a cap and at least give the director the
 
00:13:25.850 --> 00:13:25.860 align:start position:0%
opportunity to put a 10-year plan
 
00:13:28.790 --> 00:13:28.800 align:start position:0%
together that will stabilize the license
 
00:13:28.800 --> 00:13:33.230 align:start position:0%
together that will stabilize the license
fees

00:13:33.230 --> 00:13:33.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:34.550 --> 00:13:34.560 align:start position:0%
thank you very much would you be open to
 
00:13:38.030 --> 00:13:38.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:41.030 --> 00:13:41.040 align:start position:0%
yeah Andrew Kimmy please Senator Lang we
 
00:13:42.769 --> 00:13:42.779 align:start position:0%
have a house bill that does the same
 
00:13:48.050 --> 00:13:48.060 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:51.290 --> 00:13:51.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:56.750 --> 00:13:56.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:58.610 --> 00:13:58.620 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair uh and thank you
 
00:14:00.530 --> 00:14:00.540 align:start position:0%
for taking the question
 
00:14:03.530 --> 00:14:03.540 align:start position:0%
um I'm curious about whether
 
00:14:06.710 --> 00:14:06.720 align:start position:0%
we are consistent whether this
 
00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:07.910 align:start position:0%
we are consistent whether this
um

00:14:07.910 --> 00:14:07.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:14:11.569 --> 00:14:11.579 align:start position:0%
bill and the idea of returning funds to
 
00:14:15.350 --> 00:14:15.360 align:start position:0%
lowering licensing fees is consistent or
 
00:14:18.170 --> 00:14:18.180 align:start position:0%
different from other Industries for
 
00:14:20.449 --> 00:14:20.459 align:start position:0%
example liquor The Liquor Commission if
 
00:14:23.590 --> 00:14:23.600 align:start position:0%
they have excess do they use it to lower
 
00:14:26.569 --> 00:14:26.579 align:start position:0%
licensing fees so thank you for the
 
00:14:28.069 --> 00:14:28.079 align:start position:0%
question so again I'm not sure that
 
00:14:30.410 --> 00:14:30.420 align:start position:0%
liquor has any licensing fees but what
 
00:14:32.449 --> 00:14:32.459 align:start position:0%
liquor does do is they are again a
 
00:14:34.550 --> 00:14:34.560 align:start position:0%
self-funded agency so they pay for their
 
00:14:35.990 --> 00:14:36.000 align:start position:0%
own buildings and they pay for their own
 
00:14:37.850 --> 00:14:37.860 align:start position:0%
so again when they build out a brand new
 
00:14:40.009 --> 00:14:40.019 align:start position:0%
building to I'll use the example in
 
00:14:41.389 --> 00:14:41.399 align:start position:0%
Tilton right that's built a brand new
 
00:14:42.949 --> 00:14:42.959 align:start position:0%
building a couple years ago right that
 
00:14:45.129 --> 00:14:45.139 align:start position:0%
that long-term bond that long-term
 
00:14:47.870 --> 00:14:47.880 align:start position:0%
mortgage is paid for added liquor fees
 
00:14:50.030 --> 00:14:50.040 align:start position:0%
because they're a self-funded agency so
 
00:14:52.670 --> 00:14:52.680 align:start position:0%
I don't believe liquor has any licensing
 
00:14:54.410 --> 00:14:54.420 align:start position:0%
fees that they could turn back to a
 
00:14:56.810 --> 00:14:56.820 align:start position:0%
taxpayer it's all done but liquor also
 
00:14:58.610 --> 00:14:58.620 align:start position:0%
manages the price of liquor in the state
 
00:15:00.530 --> 00:15:00.540 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire and so they help you
 
00:15:02.269 --> 00:15:02.279 align:start position:0%
know as as you can tell by the latest
 
00:15:03.829 --> 00:15:03.839 align:start position:0%
report which said that New Hampshire has
 
00:15:07.250 --> 00:15:07.260 align:start position:0%
the highest liquor per capita in the
 
00:15:09.470 --> 00:15:09.480 align:start position:0%
nation um they seem to do a pretty good
 
00:15:09.480 --> 00:15:11.090 align:start position:0%
nation um they seem to do a pretty good
uh

00:15:11.090 --> 00:15:11.100 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:15:12.949 --> 00:15:12.959 align:start position:0%
they do a pretty good job at managing
 
00:15:14.810 --> 00:15:14.820 align:start position:0%
pricing to encourage people to buy here
 
00:15:16.550 --> 00:15:16.560 align:start position:0%
in the state
 
00:15:18.769 --> 00:15:18.779 align:start position:0%
follow up follow thank you and I'm
 
00:15:20.629 --> 00:15:20.639 align:start position:0%
wondering if this is more for us rather
 
00:15:23.090 --> 00:15:23.100 align:start position:0%
than for Senator Lang
 
00:15:25.730 --> 00:15:25.740 align:start position:0%
are there any other situations where
 
00:15:28.910 --> 00:15:28.920 align:start position:0%
there are licensing fees and would are
 
00:15:31.490 --> 00:15:31.500 align:start position:0%
there would there be parallel situations
 
00:15:35.449 --> 00:15:35.459 align:start position:0%
with those groups where excess funds are
 
00:15:35.459 --> 00:15:36.470 align:start position:0%
with those groups where excess funds are
returned

00:15:36.470 --> 00:15:36.480 align:start position:0%
returned
 
00:15:40.790 --> 00:15:40.800 align:start position:0%
as uh lowering those fees or would all
 
00:15:44.689 --> 00:15:44.699 align:start position:0%
of those fees stay in the general fund
 
00:15:47.389 --> 00:15:47.399 align:start position:0%
I don't know yeah I can tell you that
 
00:15:50.750 --> 00:15:50.760 align:start position:0%
lots of agencies have licensing fees
 
00:15:53.090 --> 00:15:53.100 align:start position:0%
liquor definitely does I can tell you
 
00:15:55.610 --> 00:15:55.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:58.129 --> 00:15:58.139 align:start position:0%
um and they stay in liquor this is
 
00:15:59.750 --> 00:15:59.760 align:start position:0%
different this is a unique situation
 
00:16:02.329 --> 00:16:02.339 align:start position:0%
this is the oplc so this is the office
 
00:16:04.490 --> 00:16:04.500 align:start position:0%
of professional licensure so this is a
 
00:16:07.370 --> 00:16:07.380 align:start position:0%
different category so none of the others
 
00:16:09.290 --> 00:16:09.300 align:start position:0%
that I'm aware of go back to the general
 
00:16:09.300 --> 00:16:11.449 align:start position:0%
that I'm aware of go back to the general
fund

00:16:11.449 --> 00:16:11.459 align:start position:0%
fund
 
00:16:13.550 --> 00:16:13.560 align:start position:0%
that you
 
00:16:14.870 --> 00:16:14.880 align:start position:0%
let's I'll just throw that out on the
 
00:16:16.370 --> 00:16:16.380 align:start position:0%
liquor side and I saw some hands over
 
00:16:18.110 --> 00:16:18.120 align:start position:0%
here first of all representative Oliver
 
00:16:19.730 --> 00:16:19.740 align:start position:0%
yours is up
 
00:16:21.530 --> 00:16:21.540 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
00:16:23.870 --> 00:16:23.880 align:start position:0%
um so if I if I'm if I'm reading this
 
00:16:25.790 --> 00:16:25.800 align:start position:0%
correctly the difference is that the
 
00:16:28.910 --> 00:16:28.920 align:start position:0%
house bill did not have
 
00:16:28.920 --> 00:16:29.449 align:start position:0%
house bill did not have
um

00:16:29.449 --> 00:16:29.459 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:32.150 --> 00:16:32.160 align:start position:0%
the reporting requirement and the house
 
00:16:35.870 --> 00:16:35.880 align:start position:0%
bill did not have a split cap on
 
00:16:38.930 --> 00:16:38.940 align:start position:0%
dividing it's uh three and let's say for
 
00:16:41.389 --> 00:16:41.399 align:start position:0%
our show was set at five let's say two
 
00:16:44.930 --> 00:16:44.940 align:start position:0%
just for numbers uh so we split it up in
 
00:16:47.629 --> 00:16:47.639 align:start position:0%
that fish is that correct
 
00:16:50.329 --> 00:16:50.339 align:start position:0%
so if I my understanding is um so you're
 
00:16:52.189 --> 00:16:52.199 align:start position:0%
right on the reporting requirement and
 
00:16:55.069 --> 00:16:55.079 align:start position:0%
the second aspect was there was a cap
 
00:16:57.110 --> 00:16:57.120 align:start position:0%
put in the house but again anything over
 
00:16:58.970 --> 00:16:58.980 align:start position:0%
the cap went to the general fund this
 
00:17:00.590 --> 00:17:00.600 align:start position:0%
specifies that anything over the cap
 
00:17:02.449 --> 00:17:02.459 align:start position:0%
must be used to lower
 
00:17:02.459 --> 00:17:04.069 align:start position:0%
must be used to lower
fees

00:17:04.069 --> 00:17:04.079 align:start position:0%
fees
 
00:17:07.250 --> 00:17:07.260 align:start position:0%
so follow up Madam chair follow-up
 
00:17:09.650 --> 00:17:09.660 align:start position:0%
so you're using the three million
 
00:17:11.329 --> 00:17:11.339 align:start position:0%
dollars for Capital Improvements in
 
00:17:13.250 --> 00:17:13.260 align:start position:0%
Investments and anything left over that
 
00:17:17.689 --> 00:17:17.699 align:start position:0%
so that if the uh agent LPL PLC
 
00:17:20.929 --> 00:17:20.939 align:start position:0%
um spends one million dollars on a new
 
00:17:23.929 --> 00:17:23.939 align:start position:0%
computer software upgrade whatever
 
00:17:27.710 --> 00:17:27.720 align:start position:0%
overpriced but just numbers
 
00:17:30.470 --> 00:17:30.480 align:start position:0%
um for that that would leave two million
 
00:17:34.310 --> 00:17:34.320 align:start position:0%
of the three million of the cap and they
 
00:17:37.130 --> 00:17:37.140 align:start position:0%
do all of that money
 
00:17:40.130 --> 00:17:40.140 align:start position:0%
would then also go towards reducing the
 
00:17:41.870 --> 00:17:41.880 align:start position:0%
fees because it would go back into the
 
00:17:45.350 --> 00:17:45.360 align:start position:0%
operating budget of the oplc which would
 
00:17:47.690 --> 00:17:47.700 align:start position:0%
then reduce the fees before anything
 
00:17:49.669 --> 00:17:49.679 align:start position:0%
went to the general fund
 
00:17:51.890 --> 00:17:51.900 align:start position:0%
so in this model in the model in this
 
00:17:55.070 --> 00:17:55.080 align:start position:0%
bill the way the Senate Edna and the how
 
00:17:57.289 --> 00:17:57.299 align:start position:0%
cdna modified the bill no money ever
 
00:17:59.810 --> 00:17:59.820 align:start position:0%
goes to the general fund in this bill
 
00:18:02.510 --> 00:18:02.520 align:start position:0%
there's a three million dollar cap that
 
00:18:04.730 --> 00:18:04.740 align:start position:0%
they can hold after by at the end of the
 
00:18:06.169 --> 00:18:06.179 align:start position:0%
biennium if there's more than three
 
00:18:07.789 --> 00:18:07.799 align:start position:0%
million dollars they've received rather
 
00:18:11.090 --> 00:18:11.100 align:start position:0%
than expended then they could hold that
 
00:18:12.470 --> 00:18:12.480 align:start position:0%
three million dollars they can choose
 
00:18:13.850 --> 00:18:13.860 align:start position:0%
not to they can only hold two million
 
00:18:14.750 --> 00:18:14.760 align:start position:0%
and say we're gonna put a million
 
00:18:16.250 --> 00:18:16.260 align:start position:0%
dollars back into lowering fees too
 
00:18:17.930 --> 00:18:17.940 align:start position:0%
nothing requires them to hit the cap
 
00:18:20.029 --> 00:18:20.039 align:start position:0%
before they do that but they're allowed
 
00:18:22.190 --> 00:18:22.200 align:start position:0%
to keep up to three million dollars in
 
00:18:23.930 --> 00:18:23.940 align:start position:0%
in there for long-term planning be able
 
00:18:25.909 --> 00:18:25.919 align:start position:0%
to do your Capital expenditures and
 
00:18:28.549 --> 00:18:28.559 align:start position:0%
anything that is over that so
 
00:18:31.190 --> 00:18:31.200 align:start position:0%
um let's say they brought in 3.5 million
 
00:18:32.510 --> 00:18:32.520 align:start position:0%
dollars so they kept the three million
 
00:18:33.770 --> 00:18:33.780 align:start position:0%
dollars and a half a million dollars
 
00:18:35.810 --> 00:18:35.820 align:start position:0%
that they have left they would be
 
00:18:37.549 --> 00:18:37.559 align:start position:0%
required under this bill to take that
 
00:18:39.110 --> 00:18:39.120 align:start position:0%
half a million dollars and lower
 
00:18:41.210 --> 00:18:41.220 align:start position:0%
licensing fees over the next biennium by
 
00:18:44.810 --> 00:18:44.820 align:start position:0%
half a million dollars for our nurses
 
00:18:47.210 --> 00:18:47.220 align:start position:0%
and our electricians and plumbers and
 
00:18:49.930 --> 00:18:49.940 align:start position:0%
all the people who get a uh oplc license
 
00:18:54.049 --> 00:18:54.059 align:start position:0%
one more follow-up so
 
00:18:55.430 --> 00:18:55.440 align:start position:0%
choose your
 
00:18:59.150 --> 00:18:59.160 align:start position:0%
3.5 so you now get 500 000 goes into
 
00:19:02.210 --> 00:19:02.220 align:start position:0%
reducing fees that would be applied and
 
00:19:04.010 --> 00:19:04.020 align:start position:0%
this is would be probably be a question
 
00:19:07.970 --> 00:19:07.980 align:start position:0%
for the uh uh oplc administrative staff
 
00:19:10.430 --> 00:19:10.440 align:start position:0%
as to how is that going to be divided up
 
00:19:13.130 --> 00:19:13.140 align:start position:0%
equally or where to set up in their
 
00:19:16.370 --> 00:19:16.380 align:start position:0%
operating rules in some fashion yeah I
 
00:19:18.289 --> 00:19:18.299 align:start position:0%
that's a little gray right now so again
 
00:19:20.810 --> 00:19:20.820 align:start position:0%
having having served on that committee
 
00:19:23.330 --> 00:19:23.340 align:start position:0%
with you what we learned was that each
 
00:19:23.340 --> 00:19:24.409 align:start position:0%
with you what we learned was that each
board

00:19:24.409 --> 00:19:24.419 align:start position:0%
board
 
00:19:27.650 --> 00:19:27.660 align:start position:0%
is basically assigned a cost for lack of
 
00:19:28.909 --> 00:19:28.919 align:start position:0%
interface how much how much
 
00:19:30.710 --> 00:19:30.720 align:start position:0%
administrative time they use it's a pro
 
00:19:32.570 --> 00:19:32.580 align:start position:0%
rated cost based on the entire cost of
 
00:19:32.580 --> 00:19:34.130 align:start position:0%
rated cost based on the entire cost of
oplc

00:19:34.130 --> 00:19:34.140 align:start position:0%
oplc
 
00:19:35.630 --> 00:19:35.640 align:start position:0%
um they're they're assigned a cost and
 
00:19:36.890 --> 00:19:36.900 align:start position:0%
from that cost is what they Define
 
00:19:40.430 --> 00:19:40.440 align:start position:0%
licensure from so my expectation I'm
 
00:19:41.630 --> 00:19:41.640 align:start position:0%
sure the commission will correct me if
 
00:19:43.490 --> 00:19:43.500 align:start position:0%
I'm wrong is that if there's a half a
 
00:19:46.210 --> 00:19:46.220 align:start position:0%
million dollars left over that would be
 
00:19:49.909 --> 00:19:49.919 align:start position:0%
prorated to each board based on the the
 
00:19:51.710 --> 00:19:51.720 align:start position:0%
fee that would be charged to them for
 
00:19:54.169 --> 00:19:54.179 align:start position:0%
running that board to buy oplc
 
00:19:56.150 --> 00:19:56.160 align:start position:0%
that makes sense I'm not sure if that
 
00:20:00.470 --> 00:20:00.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:00.480 --> 00:20:02.510 align:start position:0%
 
no

00:20:02.510 --> 00:20:02.520 align:start position:0%
no
 
00:20:06.830 --> 00:20:06.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:09.049 --> 00:20:09.059 align:start position:0%
representative almi
 
00:20:10.549 --> 00:20:10.559 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:20:15.409 --> 00:20:15.419 align:start position:0%
um boy a number of things about this on
 
00:20:15.419 --> 00:20:17.210 align:start position:0%
um boy a number of things about this on
the

00:20:17.210 --> 00:20:17.220 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:20:20.450 --> 00:20:20.460 align:start position:0%
you're defining as capital expenditures
 
00:20:23.270 --> 00:20:23.280 align:start position:0%
purchase of software is that normally
 
00:20:27.529 --> 00:20:27.539 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:30.350 --> 00:20:30.360 align:start position:0%
a capital expense
 
00:20:32.870 --> 00:20:32.880 align:start position:0%
I I actually sometimes yes my apologize
 
00:20:34.970 --> 00:20:34.980 align:start position:0%
could you restate the question
 
00:20:38.810 --> 00:20:38.820 align:start position:0%
um is is purchase of software which is
 
00:20:42.710 --> 00:20:42.720 align:start position:0%
the only major expense that is left it
 
00:20:48.430 --> 00:20:48.440 align:start position:0%
seems to me on a capital expense
 
00:20:51.049 --> 00:20:51.059 align:start position:0%
so again I think capital expenditure is
 
00:20:52.970 --> 00:20:52.980 align:start position:0%
usually defined by a dollar amount I'm
 
00:20:54.470 --> 00:20:54.480 align:start position:0%
not sure what the dollar amount in the
 
00:20:56.810 --> 00:20:56.820 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire is I think it's
 
00:20:58.610 --> 00:20:58.620 align:start position:0%
for the purposes of like just a contract
 
00:20:59.870 --> 00:20:59.880 align:start position:0%
with the with the executive Council
 
00:21:01.250 --> 00:21:01.260 align:start position:0%
isn't it five thousand dollars anything
 
00:21:02.930 --> 00:21:02.940 align:start position:0%
over a five thousand dollar expenditure
 
00:21:04.730 --> 00:21:04.740 align:start position:0%
would have to go outside and go to a
 
00:21:07.730 --> 00:21:07.740 align:start position:0%
separate separate expenditure so
 
00:21:09.230 --> 00:21:09.240 align:start position:0%
um would go in front of the uh so I
 
00:21:11.510 --> 00:21:11.520 align:start position:0%
would I would view this at an uh
 
00:21:12.950 --> 00:21:12.960 align:start position:0%
especially because then they have a
 
00:21:14.450 --> 00:21:14.460 align:start position:0%
hundred and some odd employees that
 
00:21:17.990 --> 00:21:18.000 align:start position:0%
something like an Erp uh uh planning
 
00:21:20.090 --> 00:21:20.100 align:start position:0%
process a customer service process that
 
00:21:21.890 --> 00:21:21.900 align:start position:0%
allows them documentation you're talking
 
00:21:23.510 --> 00:21:23.520 align:start position:0%
a multi-million dollar project having
 
00:21:25.130 --> 00:21:25.140 align:start position:0%
been in the technology industry I can
 
00:21:27.650 --> 00:21:27.660 align:start position:0%
tell you that a software upgrade for an
 
00:21:29.870 --> 00:21:29.880 align:start position:0%
Erp system for 100 users is probably
 
00:21:31.310 --> 00:21:31.320 align:start position:0%
going to run you in the range of three
 
00:21:33.289 --> 00:21:33.299 align:start position:0%
to five million dollars so this would
 
00:21:34.850 --> 00:21:34.860 align:start position:0%
allow them to be able to use that
 
00:21:36.110 --> 00:21:36.120 align:start position:0%
depending on if it's a full replacement
 
00:21:38.870 --> 00:21:38.880 align:start position:0%
just a minor upgrade or just a tweak but
 
00:21:40.970 --> 00:21:40.980 align:start position:0%
um that kind of we're talking about
 
00:21:44.289 --> 00:21:44.299 align:start position:0%
again serious money
 
00:21:47.870 --> 00:21:47.880 align:start position:0%
and yeah and that particular one the the
 
00:21:52.370 --> 00:21:52.380 align:start position:0%
software industry to my distress has on
 
00:21:55.430 --> 00:21:55.440 align:start position:0%
moved to doing subscriptions rather than
 
00:21:55.440 --> 00:21:56.990 align:start position:0%
moved to doing subscriptions rather than
purchases

00:21:56.990 --> 00:21:57.000 align:start position:0%
purchases
 
00:21:59.210 --> 00:21:59.220 align:start position:0%
and quite frequently they only they
 
00:22:01.310 --> 00:22:01.320 align:start position:0%
require that you do it that way and I
 
00:22:03.890 --> 00:22:03.900 align:start position:0%
understood uh from her testimony before
 
00:22:08.390 --> 00:22:08.400 align:start position:0%
that uh on they are looking at doing
 
00:22:12.070 --> 00:22:12.080 align:start position:0%
those software upgrades as subscriptions
 
00:22:16.310 --> 00:22:16.320 align:start position:0%
which would even out the money over the
 
00:22:18.770 --> 00:22:18.780 align:start position:0%
years so again it would talk about
 
00:22:20.990 --> 00:22:21.000 align:start position:0%
whether you purchase or or SAS software
 
00:22:23.870 --> 00:22:23.880 align:start position:0%
as a service model but even in a
 
00:22:25.970 --> 00:22:25.980 align:start position:0%
software as a service model when you
 
00:22:28.130 --> 00:22:28.140 align:start position:0%
make changes to the base model so you
 
00:22:29.750 --> 00:22:29.760 align:start position:0%
can buy a piece of software I did this
 
00:22:30.950 --> 00:22:30.960 align:start position:0%
for I worked in the healthcare
 
00:22:32.510 --> 00:22:32.520 align:start position:0%
Information Technology electronic
 
00:22:34.490 --> 00:22:34.500 align:start position:0%
medical record systems and so when you
 
00:22:37.130 --> 00:22:37.140 align:start position:0%
do a change for a given office so if
 
00:22:39.529 --> 00:22:39.539 align:start position:0%
oplc wants a workflow a certain way and
 
00:22:41.570 --> 00:22:41.580 align:start position:0%
they want to modify that workflow that's
 
00:22:42.770 --> 00:22:42.780 align:start position:0%
not covered under your monthly
 
00:22:44.510 --> 00:22:44.520 align:start position:0%
subscription it's still going to be an
 
00:22:46.549 --> 00:22:46.559 align:start position:0%
additional cost to do that customized
 
00:22:48.590 --> 00:22:48.600 align:start position:0%
workflow process which will still be
 
00:22:50.570 --> 00:22:50.580 align:start position:0%
again if you're affecting 100 users in
 
00:22:53.390 --> 00:22:53.400 align:start position:0%
100 different version uh 100 computer
 
00:22:55.190 --> 00:22:55.200 align:start position:0%
systems that upgrade could be
 
00:22:56.750 --> 00:22:56.760 align:start position:0%
multi-million dollar upgrade depending
 
00:22:58.669 --> 00:22:58.679 align:start position:0%
on what the nature of the change is
 
00:23:00.529 --> 00:23:00.539 align:start position:0%
that's outside the out of the box
 
00:23:00.539 --> 00:23:02.210 align:start position:0%
that's outside the out of the box
software

00:23:02.210 --> 00:23:02.220 align:start position:0%
software
 
00:23:03.529 --> 00:23:03.539 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:23:07.210 --> 00:23:07.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:10.909 --> 00:23:10.919 align:start position:0%
I think I took it down thank you uh
 
00:23:12.770 --> 00:23:12.780 align:start position:0%
other representative fellows
 
00:23:16.070 --> 00:23:16.080 align:start position:0%
um yes ma'am cheer um I I have a list of
 
00:23:19.789 --> 00:23:19.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:23.149 --> 00:23:23.159 align:start position:0%
my my first question has to do with just
 
00:23:26.450 --> 00:23:26.460 align:start position:0%
the bill I looked at it and and I
 
00:23:27.710 --> 00:23:27.720 align:start position:0%
couldn't when I when I tried to figure
 
00:23:29.510 --> 00:23:29.520 align:start position:0%
out like what does the bill currently
 
00:23:32.029 --> 00:23:32.039 align:start position:0%
say now so take out you know the
 
00:23:34.370 --> 00:23:34.380 align:start position:0%
crossouts I couldn't put together a
 
00:23:36.110 --> 00:23:36.120 align:start position:0%
whole sentence there kind of in the
 
00:23:38.570 --> 00:23:38.580 align:start position:0%
middle of the first paragraph So I
 
00:23:40.669 --> 00:23:40.679 align:start position:0%
looked back I went to the rsas and
 
00:23:43.909 --> 00:23:43.919 align:start position:0%
looked at them and this this bill is not
 
00:23:45.710 --> 00:23:45.720 align:start position:0%
drafted correctly
 
00:23:49.070 --> 00:23:49.080 align:start position:0%
because the language like the part shall
 
00:23:51.110 --> 00:23:51.120 align:start position:0%
be used for Capital expenditures like
 
00:23:53.450 --> 00:23:53.460 align:start position:0%
that part of it's not in the current RSA
 
00:23:56.630 --> 00:23:56.640 align:start position:0%
and unless I'm missing something
 
00:23:58.130 --> 00:23:58.140 align:start position:0%
um I actually comment on that a little
 
00:23:59.930 --> 00:23:59.940 align:start position:0%
bit just the reason why representative
 
00:24:03.710 --> 00:24:03.720 align:start position:0%
McGuire the chairman of Edna tabled our
 
00:24:05.450 --> 00:24:05.460 align:start position:0%
bill is because she's working on another
 
00:24:08.270 --> 00:24:08.280 align:start position:0%
big piece of this which is re-codifying
 
00:24:08.280 --> 00:24:09.230 align:start position:0%
big piece of this which is re-codifying
everything

00:24:09.230 --> 00:24:09.240 align:start position:0%
everything
 
00:24:11.289 --> 00:24:11.299 align:start position:0%
so there is going to be some changing
 
00:24:13.490 --> 00:24:13.500 align:start position:0%
RSA numbers
 
00:24:15.350 --> 00:24:15.360 align:start position:0%
so that's why you may not be seeing it
 
00:24:16.730 --> 00:24:16.740 align:start position:0%
anywhere because there's other moving
 
00:24:16.740 --> 00:24:17.690 align:start position:0%
anywhere because there's other moving
parts

00:24:17.690 --> 00:24:17.700 align:start position:0%
parts
 
00:24:17.700 --> 00:24:20.390 align:start position:0%
parts
so

00:24:20.390 --> 00:24:20.400 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:24:23.270 --> 00:24:23.280 align:start position:0%
so are you saying that this bill is
 
00:24:25.730 --> 00:24:25.740 align:start position:0%
irrelevant because it's going to show up
 
00:24:28.850 --> 00:24:28.860 align:start position:0%
in another bill I believe not I believe
 
00:24:30.890 --> 00:24:30.900 align:start position:0%
the other bill is going to be more of
 
00:24:33.649 --> 00:24:33.659 align:start position:0%
redesigning the structure of oplc and
 
00:24:35.990 --> 00:24:36.000 align:start position:0%
this is more just on the
 
00:24:37.970 --> 00:24:37.980 align:start position:0%
how much money can they hold on so my
 
00:24:40.610 --> 00:24:40.620 align:start position:0%
comment is about the drafting because
 
00:24:44.390 --> 00:24:44.400 align:start position:0%
what I see here this is not
 
00:24:48.770 --> 00:24:48.780 align:start position:0%
the um the first sections is not that
 
00:24:53.330 --> 00:24:53.340 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:55.789 --> 00:24:55.799 align:start position:0%
so that that's a concern because we
 
00:25:01.549 --> 00:25:01.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:03.470 --> 00:25:03.480 align:start position:0%
representative Platt has had his hand
 
00:25:05.210 --> 00:25:05.220 align:start position:0%
waving over here so look you're okay
 
00:25:09.230 --> 00:25:09.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:11.810 --> 00:25:11.820 align:start position:0%
so are you are you responding to my
 
00:25:15.830 --> 00:25:15.840 align:start position:0%
comment yes please the way
 
00:25:18.830 --> 00:25:18.840 align:start position:0%
I think some of the confusion is this
 
00:25:20.690 --> 00:25:20.700 align:start position:0%
bill was modified in the modifications
 
00:25:22.430 --> 00:25:22.440 align:start position:0%
are the ones that are being shown not
 
00:25:23.810 --> 00:25:23.820 align:start position:0%
new language
 
00:25:26.570 --> 00:25:26.580 align:start position:0%
this entire thing could be in just plain
 
00:25:29.750 --> 00:25:29.760 align:start position:0%
if it was to replace the entire thing
 
00:25:33.110 --> 00:25:33.120 align:start position:0%
so whatever language shows up in here
 
00:25:36.289 --> 00:25:36.299 align:start position:0%
is going to go into law whether it's
 
00:25:38.029 --> 00:25:38.039 align:start position:0%
there now or not no
 
00:25:41.810 --> 00:25:41.820 align:start position:0%
so anyway I think I you know maybe you
 
00:25:43.789 --> 00:25:43.799 align:start position:0%
would need to check on that okay I mean
 
00:25:45.710 --> 00:25:45.720 align:start position:0%
I do understand and we can you know I
 
00:25:48.049 --> 00:25:48.059 align:start position:0%
have questions about the intent but I
 
00:25:49.490 --> 00:25:49.500 align:start position:0%
think that there's an issue with the
 
00:25:52.130 --> 00:25:52.140 align:start position:0%
drafting I would just remind folks that
 
00:25:54.230 --> 00:25:54.240 align:start position:0%
we are the second committee on this so
 
00:25:56.390 --> 00:25:56.400 align:start position:0%
we are not discussing the underlying
 
00:26:00.470 --> 00:26:00.480 align:start position:0%
policy as much as really focusing on the
 
00:26:03.169 --> 00:26:03.179 align:start position:0%
non-lapsing nature of the fund the cap
 
00:26:05.990 --> 00:26:06.000 align:start position:0%
on the fund that's really our Focus just
 
00:26:09.310 --> 00:26:09.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:13.789 --> 00:26:13.799 align:start position:0%
so again Senate Bill House Bill 350 655
 
00:26:15.649 --> 00:26:15.659 align:start position:0%
I think it is for 355 camera which which
 
00:26:18.169 --> 00:26:18.179 align:start position:0%
numbers but that was the oplc bill that
 
00:26:20.149 --> 00:26:20.159 align:start position:0%
again came out of the commission that uh
 
00:26:21.710 --> 00:26:21.720 align:start position:0%
representative ulry and I served on from
 
00:26:23.870 --> 00:26:23.880 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 355 which does
 
00:26:26.930 --> 00:26:26.940 align:start position:0%
huge modification to oplc but not around
 
00:26:30.230 --> 00:26:30.240 align:start position:0%
this topic so we divided the we divided
 
00:26:32.390 --> 00:26:32.400 align:start position:0%
the in the study commission we divided
 
00:26:34.850 --> 00:26:34.860 align:start position:0%
three changes that were required this
 
00:26:37.070 --> 00:26:37.080 align:start position:0%
was one of the three Senate bills House
 
00:26:39.649 --> 00:26:39.659 align:start position:0%
Bill 355 representative McGuire's bill I
 
00:26:40.549 --> 00:26:40.559 align:start position:0%
think it is
 
00:26:42.769 --> 00:26:42.779 align:start position:0%
um was the was the big policy change and
 
00:26:44.210 --> 00:26:44.220 align:start position:0%
then it was one other one I drawn a
 
00:26:45.649 --> 00:26:45.659 align:start position:0%
blank on what that one was
 
00:26:48.169 --> 00:26:48.179 align:start position:0%
so but there were three policy changes
 
00:26:50.510 --> 00:26:50.520 align:start position:0%
this one speak to to the Chairman's
 
00:26:51.950 --> 00:26:51.960 align:start position:0%
point this one is specifically about
 
00:26:54.110 --> 00:26:54.120 align:start position:0%
what happens to the lapses and the fact
 
00:26:57.470 --> 00:26:57.480 align:start position:0%
that the lapse needs should go to serve
 
00:26:59.630 --> 00:26:59.640 align:start position:0%
the people that paid the fee to begin
 
00:27:02.090 --> 00:27:02.100 align:start position:0%
with and to make sure that we use that
 
00:27:04.490 --> 00:27:04.500 align:start position:0%
to keep the costs as low as possible for
 
00:27:08.390 --> 00:27:08.400 align:start position:0%
the licenses licenses that we issue so
 
00:27:11.269 --> 00:27:11.279 align:start position:0%
so that was so so I told you about my
 
00:27:14.750 --> 00:27:14.760 align:start position:0%
first concern so my second concern is
 
00:27:14.760 --> 00:27:15.590 align:start position:0%
first concern so my second concern is
that

00:27:15.590 --> 00:27:15.600 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:27:19.730 --> 00:27:19.740 align:start position:0%
from the um your testimony it it occurs
 
00:27:21.950 --> 00:27:21.960 align:start position:0%
to me that we wouldn't be having this
 
00:27:28.010 --> 00:27:28.020 align:start position:0%
bill if the fees currently did not give
 
00:27:32.090 --> 00:27:32.100 align:start position:0%
the um the agency a surplus that was so
 
00:27:34.370 --> 00:27:34.380 align:start position:0%
big is the one as the ones that we're
 
00:27:36.830 --> 00:27:36.840 align:start position:0%
we're getting because that current loss
 
00:27:38.149 --> 00:27:38.159 align:start position:0%
is the
 
00:27:41.090 --> 00:27:41.100 align:start position:0%
they're not supposed to be generating
 
00:27:45.169 --> 00:27:45.179 align:start position:0%
more Revenue than 125 percent of what it
 
00:27:46.970 --> 00:27:46.980 align:start position:0%
costs to operate
 
00:27:46.980 --> 00:27:48.350 align:start position:0%
costs to operate
so

00:27:48.350 --> 00:27:48.360 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:27:51.289 --> 00:27:51.299 align:start position:0%
obviously the fees are too cumulative
 
00:27:53.450 --> 00:27:53.460 align:start position:0%
fees are too high now
 
00:27:53.460 --> 00:27:55.130 align:start position:0%
fees are too high now
and

00:27:55.130 --> 00:27:55.140 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:27:56.630 --> 00:27:56.640 align:start position:0%
um I
 
00:27:59.090 --> 00:27:59.100 align:start position:0%
you and I since we're both on gel car
 
00:28:01.789 --> 00:28:01.799 align:start position:0%
you may have looked at something that's
 
00:28:04.070 --> 00:28:04.080 align:start position:0%
coming up for the next meeting that had
 
00:28:06.950 --> 00:28:06.960 align:start position:0%
actually had several pages that
 
00:28:08.630 --> 00:28:08.640 align:start position:0%
identified all the different fees for
 
00:28:12.830 --> 00:28:12.840 align:start position:0%
all of them and clearly some to me in my
 
00:28:14.810 --> 00:28:14.820 align:start position:0%
mind some were like too high and some
 
00:28:18.490 --> 00:28:18.500 align:start position:0%
were too low but can you tell me
 
00:28:23.029 --> 00:28:23.039 align:start position:0%
what plans are in the works and how how
 
00:28:26.049 --> 00:28:26.059 align:start position:0%
would would the agency go about
 
00:28:29.690 --> 00:28:29.700 align:start position:0%
determining what the accurate
 
00:28:32.029 --> 00:28:32.039 align:start position:0%
um what appropriate
 
00:28:34.610 --> 00:28:34.620 align:start position:0%
bees would be as opposed to what's in
 
00:28:37.310 --> 00:28:37.320 align:start position:0%
there now sure so so understand that
 
00:28:40.630 --> 00:28:40.640 align:start position:0%
oplc has
 
00:28:43.310 --> 00:28:43.320 align:start position:0%
defense to the commissioner she's been
 
00:28:44.630 --> 00:28:44.640 align:start position:0%
trying to hit a moving Target because
 
00:28:46.370 --> 00:28:46.380 align:start position:0%
the legislature keeps changing it and
 
00:28:47.990 --> 00:28:48.000 align:start position:0%
she's trying to shoot at it hit it right
 
00:28:49.789 --> 00:28:49.799 align:start position:0%
and so I think she's doing the right
 
00:28:52.310 --> 00:28:52.320 align:start position:0%
things again we see that in 2002 the
 
00:28:54.350 --> 00:28:54.360 align:start position:0%
number dramatically reduced right it
 
00:28:57.710 --> 00:28:57.720 align:start position:0%
went from 4.1 million in 2001 and then
 
00:28:59.269 --> 00:28:59.279 align:start position:0%
they made some changes and it went down
 
00:29:02.149 --> 00:29:02.159 align:start position:0%
to 2.6 million so it dropped dropped
 
00:29:04.909 --> 00:29:04.919 align:start position:0%
over a million 1.5 million dollars do
 
00:29:08.330 --> 00:29:08.340 align:start position:0%
you mean 2021 from 2021 to 2022 it
 
00:29:10.549 --> 00:29:10.559 align:start position:0%
dropped by 1.5 million dollars Surplus
 
00:29:12.049 --> 00:29:12.059 align:start position:0%
reduction because they adjusted into
 
00:29:13.970 --> 00:29:13.980 align:start position:0%
doing so they're trying trying to
 
00:29:17.269 --> 00:29:17.279 align:start position:0%
correct and not have a dramatic Surplus
 
00:29:19.310 --> 00:29:19.320 align:start position:0%
um and so I I think they're doing a
 
00:29:21.169 --> 00:29:21.179 align:start position:0%
great job but again it's a moving Target
 
00:29:23.570 --> 00:29:23.580 align:start position:0%
we just like I said House Bill 355 is
 
00:29:25.850 --> 00:29:25.860 align:start position:0%
gonna or 655 whatever that number is is
 
00:29:27.409 --> 00:29:27.419 align:start position:0%
going to dramatically change stuff again
 
00:29:28.730 --> 00:29:28.740 align:start position:0%
for them
 
00:29:31.190 --> 00:29:31.200 align:start position:0%
um but I think they're doing a great job
 
00:29:33.230 --> 00:29:33.240 align:start position:0%
at trying to keep this Surplus down but
 
00:29:35.750 --> 00:29:35.760 align:start position:0%
in the event there is a surplus that
 
00:29:38.330 --> 00:29:38.340 align:start position:0%
what this build really says is it's not
 
00:29:40.250 --> 00:29:40.260 align:start position:0%
general fund money to go for Allstate
 
00:29:42.230 --> 00:29:42.240 align:start position:0%
for the entire state it should go back
 
00:29:43.730 --> 00:29:43.740 align:start position:0%
and be used for the purposes of the
 
00:29:46.549 --> 00:29:46.559 align:start position:0%
people who paid those fees in alignment
 
00:29:47.930 --> 00:29:47.940 align:start position:0%
with the superior the Supreme Court
 
00:29:50.149 --> 00:29:50.159 align:start position:0%
decision of 125 percent and anything
 
00:29:52.070 --> 00:29:52.080 align:start position:0%
above that is
 
00:29:55.430 --> 00:29:55.440 align:start position:0%
um consider the tax and be unfair tax
 
00:29:55.440 --> 00:29:57.590 align:start position:0%
um consider the tax and be unfair tax
representative

00:29:57.590 --> 00:29:57.600 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:30:00.409 --> 00:30:00.419 align:start position:0%
yes I'm curious uh Senator Lang what's
 
00:30:02.330 --> 00:30:02.340 align:start position:0%
your problem with the cap
 
00:30:04.730 --> 00:30:04.740 align:start position:0%
well again I'd like to I I don't I don't
 
00:30:07.130 --> 00:30:07.140 align:start position:0%
work in oplc so I don't know what their
 
00:30:09.169 --> 00:30:09.179 align:start position:0%
plans are for the next 10 years as they
 
00:30:11.570 --> 00:30:11.580 align:start position:0%
look at this and so I'd like to give the
 
00:30:14.029 --> 00:30:14.039 align:start position:0%
commission the opportunity to put a plan
 
00:30:16.669 --> 00:30:16.679 align:start position:0%
together to find out whether or not
 
00:30:18.649 --> 00:30:18.659 align:start position:0%
um you know just like I said our schools
 
00:30:20.210 --> 00:30:20.220 align:start position:0%
and towns know we've got to replace a
 
00:30:22.310 --> 00:30:22.320 align:start position:0%
roof on a building and so we may put
 
00:30:24.889 --> 00:30:24.899 align:start position:0%
aside 250 000 a year of undesignated
 
00:30:26.630 --> 00:30:26.640 align:start position:0%
fund balance a year for five six years
 
00:30:28.430 --> 00:30:28.440 align:start position:0%
to pay for a multi-million dollar roof
 
00:30:30.649 --> 00:30:30.659 align:start position:0%
on a Town building or a school rather
 
00:30:33.230 --> 00:30:33.240 align:start position:0%
than have that all hit in one year and
 
00:30:36.230 --> 00:30:36.240 align:start position:0%
jump the local tax rate up and so I'd
 
00:30:38.690 --> 00:30:38.700 align:start position:0%
like to you know my opinion was I
 
00:30:40.730 --> 00:30:40.740 align:start position:0%
trusted the commissioner not to be able
 
00:30:42.529 --> 00:30:42.539 align:start position:0%
to put a 10-year type plan together and
 
00:30:44.510 --> 00:30:44.520 align:start position:0%
understand what that looks like and
 
00:30:46.909 --> 00:30:46.919 align:start position:0%
manage that fund and do an a biannual
 
00:30:48.289 --> 00:30:48.299 align:start position:0%
report and if the legislature doesn't
 
00:30:50.870 --> 00:30:50.880 align:start position:0%
like what it sees it can go put a cap on
 
00:30:52.010 --> 00:30:52.020 align:start position:0%
it but at least give their first
 
00:30:54.409 --> 00:30:54.419 align:start position:0%
opportunity for not having a cap to let
 
00:30:58.130 --> 00:30:58.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:00.950 --> 00:31:00.960 align:start position:0%
you still open to more
 
00:31:02.269 --> 00:31:02.279 align:start position:0%
quickly you are today representative
 
00:31:02.279 --> 00:31:03.350 align:start position:0%
quickly you are today representative

00:31:03.350 --> 00:31:03.360 align:start position:0%
elberger
 
00:31:06.049 --> 00:31:06.059 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair first just a quick
 
00:31:07.510 --> 00:31:07.520 align:start position:0%
comment about
 
00:31:10.789 --> 00:31:10.799 align:start position:0%
subscriptions while
 
00:31:14.210 --> 00:31:14.220 align:start position:0%
it may be easier to spread cost over
 
00:31:16.310 --> 00:31:16.320 align:start position:0%
time the amount you're paying for
 
00:31:18.310 --> 00:31:18.320 align:start position:0%
something is almost invariably
 
00:31:20.510 --> 00:31:20.520 align:start position:0%
significantly higher than if you do an
 
00:31:23.090 --> 00:31:23.100 align:start position:0%
outright purchase
 
00:31:28.070 --> 00:31:28.080 align:start position:0%
and having gotten that off my chest I
 
00:31:30.649 --> 00:31:30.659 align:start position:0%
want to look at the other end
 
00:31:30.659 --> 00:31:32.210 align:start position:0%
want to look at the other end
um

00:31:32.210 --> 00:31:32.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:31:35.630 --> 00:31:35.640 align:start position:0%
what this Bill is saying is that there's
 
00:31:38.450 --> 00:31:38.460 align:start position:0%
a recognition that fees are too high or
 
00:31:40.010 --> 00:31:40.020 align:start position:0%
may be too high and when they are
 
00:31:43.610 --> 00:31:43.620 align:start position:0%
determined to be too high then the fees
 
00:31:46.010 --> 00:31:46.020 align:start position:0%
would be reduced I'm wondering about the
 
00:31:48.350 --> 00:31:48.360 align:start position:0%
reverse if it gets to be a situation
 
00:31:50.210 --> 00:31:50.220 align:start position:0%
where the fees are not covering the
 
00:31:50.220 --> 00:31:51.409 align:start position:0%
where the fees are not covering the
costs

00:31:51.409 --> 00:31:51.419 align:start position:0%
costs
 
00:31:51.419 --> 00:31:52.549 align:start position:0%
costs
is

00:31:52.549 --> 00:31:52.559 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:31:54.769 --> 00:31:54.779 align:start position:0%
it understood that the fees could be
 
00:31:57.350 --> 00:31:57.360 align:start position:0%
increased I don't see any language about
 
00:31:59.389 --> 00:31:59.399 align:start position:0%
that in here so again that's a different
 
00:32:01.850 --> 00:32:01.860 align:start position:0%
part of the law so two things could
 
00:32:04.610 --> 00:32:04.620 align:start position:0%
happen in that case so in the event that
 
00:32:07.010 --> 00:32:07.020 align:start position:0%
they lowered fees and then they ended up
 
00:32:09.049 --> 00:32:09.059 align:start position:0%
not taking enough Revenue in to cover
 
00:32:11.149 --> 00:32:11.159 align:start position:0%
the cost of oplc they could also use
 
00:32:13.190 --> 00:32:13.200 align:start position:0%
this fun to supplement that and to make
 
00:32:14.630 --> 00:32:14.640 align:start position:0%
sure that the fund was whole and that we
 
00:32:17.029 --> 00:32:17.039 align:start position:0%
didn't have a deficit in that agency so
 
00:32:18.430 --> 00:32:18.440 align:start position:0%
it could be used to supplant
 
00:32:21.110 --> 00:32:21.120 align:start position:0%
underperforming it licensors
 
00:32:21.120 --> 00:32:21.769 align:start position:0%
underperforming it licensors
um

00:32:21.769 --> 00:32:21.779 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:32:23.510 --> 00:32:23.520 align:start position:0%
so I
 
00:32:26.149 --> 00:32:26.159 align:start position:0%
so that to I guess I'm not sure if I
 
00:32:27.110 --> 00:32:27.120 align:start position:0%
understand the second half of your
 
00:32:28.010 --> 00:32:28.020 align:start position:0%
question the second part of your
 
00:32:29.870 --> 00:32:29.880 align:start position:0%
question so the question
 
00:32:31.370 --> 00:32:31.380 align:start position:0%
um if I may
 
00:32:31.380 --> 00:32:32.510 align:start position:0%
um if I may
um

00:32:32.510 --> 00:32:32.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:32:35.210 --> 00:32:35.220 align:start position:0%
what happens if it gets to a point where
 
00:32:38.690 --> 00:32:38.700 align:start position:0%
there is not enough in the fund
 
00:32:40.789 --> 00:32:40.799 align:start position:0%
to cover costs
 
00:32:44.690 --> 00:32:44.700 align:start position:0%
without increasing fees is it understood
 
00:32:47.870 --> 00:32:47.880 align:start position:0%
at that point that while
 
00:32:51.889 --> 00:32:51.899 align:start position:0%
that oplc has the option to both lower
 
00:32:54.350 --> 00:32:54.360 align:start position:0%
and raise thank you for the question so
 
00:32:58.370 --> 00:32:58.380 align:start position:0%
again in in that house bill 355 365 650
 
00:33:00.230 --> 00:33:00.240 align:start position:0%
right whatever that number is
 
00:33:02.149 --> 00:33:02.159 align:start position:0%
um I will say one of the things that we
 
00:33:04.070 --> 00:33:04.080 align:start position:0%
were cleaning up and we learned what
 
00:33:05.450 --> 00:33:05.460 align:start position:0%
representative ulry and I learned in
 
00:33:08.570 --> 00:33:08.580 align:start position:0%
that in that um committee was that we
 
00:33:10.730 --> 00:33:10.740 align:start position:0%
have conflicting law and we were trying
 
00:33:12.230 --> 00:33:12.240 align:start position:0%
to look at cleaning it up we have places
 
00:33:14.389 --> 00:33:14.399 align:start position:0%
where the oplc director has the right to
 
00:33:16.490 --> 00:33:16.500 align:start position:0%
set licensing fees and then we also give
 
00:33:18.830 --> 00:33:18.840 align:start position:0%
that same exact right to a board and the
 
00:33:20.330 --> 00:33:20.340 align:start position:0%
board has a right to set fees I don't
 
00:33:21.470 --> 00:33:21.480 align:start position:0%
know what happens if we have conflict
 
00:33:23.210 --> 00:33:23.220 align:start position:0%
between those two but the purpose of one
 
00:33:25.430 --> 00:33:25.440 align:start position:0%
of the purposes of that house bill was
 
00:33:28.250 --> 00:33:28.260 align:start position:0%
to clean up that conflict in law so the
 
00:33:31.009 --> 00:33:31.019 align:start position:0%
oplc director or the board uh under
 
00:33:32.810 --> 00:33:32.820 align:start position:0%
current law already has the right to
 
00:33:35.570 --> 00:33:35.580 align:start position:0%
raise and lower prices so we don't need
 
00:33:37.909 --> 00:33:37.919 align:start position:0%
to give that the question is if if the
 
00:33:40.610 --> 00:33:40.620 align:start position:0%
price is such that we end up with for
 
00:33:42.409 --> 00:33:42.419 align:start position:0%
some reason the giant Surplus what we do
 
00:33:43.730 --> 00:33:43.740 align:start position:0%
with that we want to make sure it goes
 
00:33:46.549 --> 00:33:46.559 align:start position:0%
back to pay back to the licensees thank
 
00:33:48.470 --> 00:33:48.480 align:start position:0%
you thank you madam
 
00:33:50.570 --> 00:33:50.580 align:start position:0%
okay other questions for Senator Lane
 
00:33:52.789 --> 00:33:52.799 align:start position:0%
keeping in mind uh I have no other pink
 
00:33:55.250 --> 00:33:55.260 align:start position:0%
cards but we might have an expert in the
 
00:33:58.130 --> 00:33:58.140 align:start position:0%
audience so representative homie yes I
 
00:33:59.690 --> 00:33:59.700 align:start position:0%
think I'll Reserve most of my questions
 
00:34:02.870 --> 00:34:02.880 align:start position:0%
for that but we are
 
00:34:02.880 --> 00:34:04.029 align:start position:0%
for that but we are
um

00:34:04.029 --> 00:34:04.039 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:34:07.909 --> 00:34:07.919 align:start position:0%
establishing a new precedent here
 
00:34:11.750 --> 00:34:11.760 align:start position:0%
um we did not have a precedent for 125
 
00:34:15.490 --> 00:34:15.500 align:start position:0%
percent for all fees before this time
 
00:34:21.109 --> 00:34:21.119 align:start position:0%
and we are now creating that on I had a
 
00:34:24.829 --> 00:34:24.839 align:start position:0%
run in with the Comptroller a year after
 
00:34:28.849 --> 00:34:28.859 align:start position:0%
she arrived on in that dedicated fund
 
00:34:33.829 --> 00:34:33.839 align:start position:0%
committee on in which on she insisted
 
00:34:36.409 --> 00:34:36.419 align:start position:0%
that since the legislature had put it
 
00:34:41.089 --> 00:34:41.099 align:start position:0%
into law that we were going to um
 
00:34:45.290 --> 00:34:45.300 align:start position:0%
have a set fee for a particular thing
 
00:34:48.409 --> 00:34:48.419 align:start position:0%
that has nothing to do with this agency
 
00:34:51.829 --> 00:34:51.839 align:start position:0%
um that and lapse the rest of it at the
 
00:34:53.750 --> 00:34:53.760 align:start position:0%
end of the year and they were routinely
 
00:34:57.430 --> 00:34:57.440 align:start position:0%
lapsing 75 of what the fee was
 
00:35:02.150 --> 00:35:02.160 align:start position:0%
to the general fund on that the
 
00:35:07.250 --> 00:35:07.260 align:start position:0%
legislative uh decision stood and the
 
00:35:10.430 --> 00:35:10.440 align:start position:0%
125 percent that the finance committee
 
00:35:12.849 --> 00:35:12.859 align:start position:0%
was using in the budget
 
00:35:16.670 --> 00:35:16.680 align:start position:0%
for a number of purposes was not a
 
00:35:16.680 --> 00:35:18.589 align:start position:0%
for a number of purposes was not a
general

00:35:18.589 --> 00:35:18.599 align:start position:0%
general
 
00:35:22.130 --> 00:35:22.140 align:start position:0%
law so we're we're making this a law now
 
00:35:25.510 --> 00:35:25.520 align:start position:0%
for oplc
 
00:35:28.670 --> 00:35:28.680 align:start position:0%
that they all do that and then we do run
 
00:35:31.490 --> 00:35:31.500 align:start position:0%
into the problem that there are a couple
 
00:35:36.349 --> 00:35:36.359 align:start position:0%
of Agents of groups that are licensed or
 
00:35:39.910 --> 00:35:39.920 align:start position:0%
or put into PLC
 
00:35:44.089 --> 00:35:44.099 align:start position:0%
in earlier days I think the manufactured
 
00:35:46.310 --> 00:35:46.320 align:start position:0%
housing was put in
 
00:35:49.190 --> 00:35:49.200 align:start position:0%
when we started is there a question for
 
00:35:52.430 --> 00:35:52.440 align:start position:0%
the senator yes and the question
 
00:35:55.609 --> 00:35:55.619 align:start position:0%
is do you recognize this is going on and
 
00:35:59.510 --> 00:35:59.520 align:start position:0%
and why are we doing this before we
 
00:36:03.050 --> 00:36:03.060 align:start position:0%
get representative McGuire's complete
 
00:36:06.050 --> 00:36:06.060 align:start position:0%
overhaul of the entire system
 
00:36:07.370 --> 00:36:07.380 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question number one
 
00:36:08.810 --> 00:36:08.820 align:start position:0%
you did get representative McGuire's you
 
00:36:10.010 --> 00:36:10.020 align:start position:0%
voted on already in the house it's
 
00:36:11.690 --> 00:36:11.700 align:start position:0%
already in the Senate Edna committee so
 
00:36:13.250 --> 00:36:13.260 align:start position:0%
you've already passed it
 
00:36:15.170 --> 00:36:15.180 align:start position:0%
um and it's over it's over in the uh
 
00:36:17.450 --> 00:36:17.460 align:start position:0%
Senate Edna and they're working if my
 
00:36:19.370 --> 00:36:19.380 align:start position:0%
understanding is
 
00:36:21.230 --> 00:36:21.240 align:start position:0%
um that bill is going to be passed
 
00:36:24.170 --> 00:36:24.180 align:start position:0%
unamended and and be done
 
00:36:25.970 --> 00:36:25.980 align:start position:0%
um to answer your other question there's
 
00:36:28.310 --> 00:36:28.320 align:start position:0%
no conversation here about 125 percent
 
00:36:30.290 --> 00:36:30.300 align:start position:0%
right you know that percentage is not
 
00:36:31.910 --> 00:36:31.920 align:start position:0%
anywhere in here all's we're saying is
 
00:36:33.650 --> 00:36:33.660 align:start position:0%
we want to keep license fees for our
 
00:36:35.930 --> 00:36:35.940 align:start position:0%
citizens as low as possible to be able
 
00:36:38.150 --> 00:36:38.160 align:start position:0%
to cover the cost of lplc not great a
 
00:36:40.250 --> 00:36:40.260 align:start position:0%
giant Surplus and if we do create a
 
00:36:41.690 --> 00:36:41.700 align:start position:0%
giant Surplus we wanted to go back to
 
00:36:42.890 --> 00:36:42.900 align:start position:0%
the citizens who are paying for those
 
00:36:44.630 --> 00:36:44.640 align:start position:0%
fees that's what this bill is
 
00:36:46.450 --> 00:36:46.460 align:start position:0%
establishing in law
 
00:36:48.290 --> 00:36:48.300 align:start position:0%
thank you other questions for the
 
00:36:49.790 --> 00:36:49.800 align:start position:0%
senator representative fellow um yeah
 
00:36:51.530 --> 00:36:51.540 align:start position:0%
this is just technical
 
00:36:54.589 --> 00:36:54.599 align:start position:0%
um I I thought I was looking at the rsas
 
00:36:57.050 --> 00:36:57.060 align:start position:0%
last night and I thought I saw that 125
 
00:36:59.089 --> 00:36:59.099 align:start position:0%
percent in there somewhere well again
 
00:37:01.370 --> 00:37:01.380 align:start position:0%
it's just not in this bill like we're
 
00:37:02.870 --> 00:37:02.880 align:start position:0%
not established and press it in this
 
00:37:04.310 --> 00:37:04.320 align:start position:0%
bill it may be in law somewhere else
 
00:37:06.530 --> 00:37:06.540 align:start position:0%
already in statute maybe can you just
 
00:37:08.089 --> 00:37:08.099 align:start position:0%
tell me about the two bills you were
 
00:37:09.710 --> 00:37:09.720 align:start position:0%
taught you've talked about two bills
 
00:37:13.069 --> 00:37:13.079 align:start position:0%
other than this one one is one got
 
00:37:17.690 --> 00:37:17.700 align:start position:0%
tabled in the house and one is now in
 
00:37:20.870 --> 00:37:20.880 align:start position:0%
um over in the Senate that are related
 
00:37:23.089 --> 00:37:23.099 align:start position:0%
to this well what I'll say is the only
 
00:37:25.069 --> 00:37:25.079 align:start position:0%
it's related in the fact that when we
 
00:37:27.109 --> 00:37:27.119 align:start position:0%
had the committee that
 
00:37:29.390 --> 00:37:29.400 align:start position:0%
um to look at oplc and the issues within
 
00:37:31.730 --> 00:37:31.740 align:start position:0%
oplc we came out with three
 
00:37:31.740 --> 00:37:33.349 align:start position:0%
oplc we came out with three
recommendations

00:37:33.349 --> 00:37:33.359 align:start position:0%
recommendations
 
00:37:35.870 --> 00:37:35.880 align:start position:0%
um and I and I believe
 
00:37:35.880 --> 00:37:36.530 align:start position:0%
um and I and I believe
um

00:37:36.530 --> 00:37:36.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:37:38.450 --> 00:37:38.460 align:start position:0%
I don't remember one of them I'm drawing
 
00:37:40.310 --> 00:37:40.320 align:start position:0%
a complete blank I apologize I didn't
 
00:37:41.870 --> 00:37:41.880 align:start position:0%
prepare for that for reading back that
 
00:37:43.250 --> 00:37:43.260 align:start position:0%
committee but
 
00:37:45.650 --> 00:37:45.660 align:start position:0%
um representative ulrey and I both took
 
00:37:47.930 --> 00:37:47.940 align:start position:0%
took uh this aspect which was the money
 
00:37:48.890 --> 00:37:48.900 align:start position:0%
because we knew it was going to go in
 
00:37:50.810 --> 00:37:50.820 align:start position:0%
front of ways and means so we Cho we we
 
00:37:53.930 --> 00:37:53.940 align:start position:0%
agreed to submit the um this bill
 
00:37:56.030 --> 00:37:56.040 align:start position:0%
um the other bill was Edna related
 
00:37:58.730 --> 00:37:58.740 align:start position:0%
relative to the operations of oplc and
 
00:38:00.530 --> 00:38:00.540 align:start position:0%
therefore uh representative McGuire
 
00:38:02.750 --> 00:38:02.760 align:start position:0%
agreed to take on that bill
 
00:38:04.670 --> 00:38:04.680 align:start position:0%
um that bill and I apologize I don't
 
00:38:06.170 --> 00:38:06.180 align:start position:0%
remember the number but that bill that's
 
00:38:08.450 --> 00:38:08.460 align:start position:0%
currently in the Senate DNA
 
00:38:11.510 --> 00:38:11.520 align:start position:0%
um is already been voted on by the house
 
00:38:12.890 --> 00:38:12.900 align:start position:0%
and you've already seen it it's already
 
00:38:14.569 --> 00:38:14.579 align:start position:0%
been seen and voted on by the house and
 
00:38:17.329 --> 00:38:17.339 align:start position:0%
passed if I want to say it was passed on
 
00:38:17.339 --> 00:38:18.829 align:start position:0%
passed if I want to say it was passed on
consent

00:38:18.829 --> 00:38:18.839 align:start position:0%
consent
 
00:38:22.190 --> 00:38:22.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:24.530 --> 00:38:24.540 align:start position:0%
thank you Senator
 
00:38:26.930 --> 00:38:26.940 align:start position:0%
um thank you thank you
 
00:38:29.930 --> 00:38:29.940 align:start position:0%
oh well I I had a question
 
00:38:33.650 --> 00:38:33.660 align:start position:0%
for the senator for the oplc I for I
 
00:38:35.390 --> 00:38:35.400 align:start position:0%
think for the senator because there is
 
00:38:39.650 --> 00:38:39.660 align:start position:0%
nobody here yet from lbao
 
00:38:44.569 --> 00:38:44.579 align:start position:0%
uh to answer this why do we have a zero
 
00:38:49.130 --> 00:38:49.140 align:start position:0%
fiscal note when it is clear that uh
 
00:38:52.130 --> 00:38:52.140 align:start position:0%
they are going to reduce the lapse to
 
00:38:55.609 --> 00:38:55.619 align:start position:0%
the general fund by 6.5 to 8 million
 
00:39:02.630 --> 00:39:02.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:04.609 --> 00:39:04.619 align:start position:0%
as an LBA question I honestly don't know
 
00:39:06.109 --> 00:39:06.119 align:start position:0%
why on the fiscal note they didn't
 
00:39:08.030 --> 00:39:08.040 align:start position:0%
assign a dollar figure or maybe the
 
00:39:09.770 --> 00:39:09.780 align:start position:0%
commissioner could answer that question
 
00:39:12.050 --> 00:39:12.060 align:start position:0%
yeah the commissioner actually is the
 
00:39:14.089 --> 00:39:14.099 align:start position:0%
one that produced the information so
 
00:39:17.390 --> 00:39:17.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:19.069 --> 00:39:19.079 align:start position:0%
thank you for accepting all these
 
00:39:21.170 --> 00:39:21.180 align:start position:0%
questions if I had to make a guess just
 
00:39:22.730 --> 00:39:22.740 align:start position:0%
to say it's because we don't actually
 
00:39:25.130 --> 00:39:25.140 align:start position:0%
reduce any fees or funds we just change
 
00:39:27.050 --> 00:39:27.060 align:start position:0%
the allocation on where it goes so the
 
00:39:28.670 --> 00:39:28.680 align:start position:0%
state doesn't see less Revenue it just
 
00:39:31.190 --> 00:39:31.200 align:start position:0%
sees a change in the allocation of the
 
00:39:31.200 --> 00:39:32.870 align:start position:0%
sees a change in the allocation of the
fund

00:39:32.870 --> 00:39:32.880 align:start position:0%
fund
 
00:39:36.410 --> 00:39:36.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:38.329 --> 00:39:38.339 align:start position:0%
I apologize I'm not sure if are you a
 
00:39:40.310 --> 00:39:40.320 align:start position:0%
commissioner or director
 
00:39:42.650 --> 00:39:42.660 align:start position:0%
director welcome uh thank you for
 
00:39:44.630 --> 00:39:44.640 align:start position:0%
filling out a pin card thank you for
 
00:39:50.750 --> 00:39:50.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:52.730 --> 00:39:52.740 align:start position:0%
could you please introduce introduce
 
00:39:54.770 --> 00:39:54.780 align:start position:0%
yourself for the uh committee and if you
 
00:39:56.450 --> 00:39:56.460 align:start position:0%
wouldn't mind if you can answer any of
 
00:39:57.950 --> 00:39:57.960 align:start position:0%
these questions that would be helpful
 
00:39:59.810 --> 00:39:59.820 align:start position:0%
certainly thank you madam chair members
 
00:40:01.430 --> 00:40:01.440 align:start position:0%
of the committee Lindsey Courtney I'm
 
00:40:02.810 --> 00:40:02.820 align:start position:0%
the executive director of the New
 
00:40:03.890 --> 00:40:03.900 align:start position:0%
Hampshire office of professional
 
00:40:06.410 --> 00:40:06.420 align:start position:0%
licensure and certification and I wish
 
00:40:08.690 --> 00:40:08.700 align:start position:0%
to thank Senator Lang for bringing this
 
00:40:11.750 --> 00:40:11.760 align:start position:0%
bill forward oplc fully supports
 
00:40:13.970 --> 00:40:13.980 align:start position:0%
um this bill
 
00:40:16.190 --> 00:40:16.200 align:start position:0%
um I wanted to start by addressing some
 
00:40:18.950 --> 00:40:18.960 align:start position:0%
of the questions specifically around the
 
00:40:21.349 --> 00:40:21.359 align:start position:0%
oplc Surplus
 
00:40:21.359 --> 00:40:23.870 align:start position:0%
oplc Surplus
so

00:40:23.870 --> 00:40:23.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:40:26.510 --> 00:40:26.520 align:start position:0%
the the cause of the Surplus is really
 
00:40:31.190 --> 00:40:31.200 align:start position:0%
twofold first up until last session over
 
00:40:33.589 --> 00:40:33.599 align:start position:0%
half the practice acts had fees set
 
00:40:36.950 --> 00:40:36.960 align:start position:0%
forth in statute and as all of you know
 
00:40:40.190 --> 00:40:40.200 align:start position:0%
we have no ability to change fees that
 
00:40:42.650 --> 00:40:42.660 align:start position:0%
are in statute
 
00:40:44.589 --> 00:40:44.599 align:start position:0%
um generally those fees were either 300
 
00:40:47.750 --> 00:40:47.760 align:start position:0%
or a hundred and ten dollars
 
00:40:52.010 --> 00:40:52.020 align:start position:0%
um generally the 300 fees were way above
 
00:40:55.670 --> 00:40:55.680 align:start position:0%
125 and 110 was a little bit below the
 
00:40:55.680 --> 00:40:56.569 align:start position:0%
125 and 110 was a little bit below the
100

00:40:56.569 --> 00:40:56.579 align:start position:0%
100
 
00:40:59.870 --> 00:40:59.880 align:start position:0%
um the 125 Mark
 
00:41:02.810 --> 00:41:02.820 align:start position:0%
um we had tried consistently since 2019
 
00:41:05.210 --> 00:41:05.220 align:start position:0%
to seek legislation to remove those
 
00:41:07.370 --> 00:41:07.380 align:start position:0%
statutory fees
 
00:41:07.380 --> 00:41:08.109 align:start position:0%
statutory fees
um

00:41:08.109 --> 00:41:08.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:41:13.190 --> 00:41:13.200 align:start position:0%
2019 we we sought legislation 2020 2021
 
00:41:15.349 --> 00:41:15.359 align:start position:0%
it wasn't until 2022 that we are
 
00:41:15.359 --> 00:41:16.490 align:start position:0%
it wasn't until 2022 that we are
successful

00:41:16.490 --> 00:41:16.500 align:start position:0%
successful
 
00:41:19.790 --> 00:41:19.800 align:start position:0%
then in 2022 we announced uh that we
 
00:41:21.530 --> 00:41:21.540 align:start position:0%
were going to start soliciting feedback
 
00:41:23.930 --> 00:41:23.940 align:start position:0%
from our boards and stakeholders as to
 
00:41:26.329 --> 00:41:26.339 align:start position:0%
what the fees should be it was at that
 
00:41:29.150 --> 00:41:29.160 align:start position:0%
point that a few stakeholders were
 
00:41:31.670 --> 00:41:31.680 align:start position:0%
became concerned that oplc had fee
 
00:41:34.310 --> 00:41:34.320 align:start position:0%
setting authority to begin with which
 
00:41:37.609 --> 00:41:37.619 align:start position:0%
dated back to 2015 actually which
 
00:41:40.690 --> 00:41:40.700 align:start position:0%
generated a lot of uh
 
00:41:43.849 --> 00:41:43.859 align:start position:0%
comments and stakeholder participation I
 
00:41:45.290 --> 00:41:45.300 align:start position:0%
think it was before Senate Ways and
 
00:41:48.050 --> 00:41:48.060 align:start position:0%
Means so at that point in time we were
 
00:41:51.410 --> 00:41:51.420 align:start position:0%
asked by the governor's office to put a
 
00:41:54.250 --> 00:41:54.260 align:start position:0%
pause on modifying our fees and
 
00:41:57.230 --> 00:41:57.240 align:start position:0%
representative fellows The Proposal that
 
00:41:59.089 --> 00:41:59.099 align:start position:0%
you are referencing that's going for
 
00:42:01.250 --> 00:42:01.260 align:start position:0%
jail car does not
 
00:42:03.770 --> 00:42:03.780 align:start position:0%
um with several minor exceptions does
 
00:42:05.810 --> 00:42:05.820 align:start position:0%
not include any changes to fees that
 
00:42:07.790 --> 00:42:07.800 align:start position:0%
have been in existence for years
 
00:42:09.950 --> 00:42:09.960 align:start position:0%
so that is one reason why we have a
 
00:42:12.530 --> 00:42:12.540 align:start position:0%
surplus which is that many of the fees
 
00:42:14.870 --> 00:42:14.880 align:start position:0%
were statutory other fees were
 
00:42:17.569 --> 00:42:17.579 align:start position:0%
established by boards for years
 
00:42:19.910 --> 00:42:19.920 align:start position:0%
um boards themselves are not responsible
 
00:42:22.370 --> 00:42:22.380 align:start position:0%
for paying the bills and you know I I
 
00:42:24.470 --> 00:42:24.480 align:start position:0%
would venture to say that many of the
 
00:42:27.349 --> 00:42:27.359 align:start position:0%
fees were to some extent arbitrary
 
00:42:29.210 --> 00:42:29.220 align:start position:0%
many of our boards are not covering
 
00:42:31.069 --> 00:42:31.079 align:start position:0%
their costs um I would say that
 
00:42:32.930 --> 00:42:32.940 align:start position:0%
barbering and cosmetology for example
 
00:42:36.650 --> 00:42:36.660 align:start position:0%
covers about 40 percent of their costs
 
00:42:40.490 --> 00:42:40.500 align:start position:0%
they have not had fee changes uh with
 
00:42:42.170 --> 00:42:42.180 align:start position:0%
the exception of one minor fee change
 
00:42:44.329 --> 00:42:44.339 align:start position:0%
last year to raise the cost of their fee
 
00:42:46.430 --> 00:42:46.440 align:start position:0%
by ten dollars they have not had fee
 
00:42:48.470 --> 00:42:48.480 align:start position:0%
changes in years
 
00:42:50.690 --> 00:42:50.700 align:start position:0%
and one of the concerns we have in the
 
00:42:52.910 --> 00:42:52.920 align:start position:0%
office is how do you increase fees
 
00:42:55.730 --> 00:42:55.740 align:start position:0%
dramatically because the board neglected
 
00:42:59.030 --> 00:42:59.040 align:start position:0%
to raise fees incrementally over the
 
00:43:01.130 --> 00:43:01.140 align:start position:0%
course of the years so these are the
 
00:43:02.870 --> 00:43:02.880 align:start position:0%
changes and the issues that we're
 
00:43:05.089 --> 00:43:05.099 align:start position:0%
grappling with as we talk about how to
 
00:43:09.530 --> 00:43:09.540 align:start position:0%
level set the fees for the boards the
 
00:43:11.870 --> 00:43:11.880 align:start position:0%
number two reason why we have a surplus
 
00:43:13.970 --> 00:43:13.980 align:start position:0%
is because when
 
00:43:16.609 --> 00:43:16.619 align:start position:0%
um revenues State revenues are up and
 
00:43:18.710 --> 00:43:18.720 align:start position:0%
things are going well the city has money
 
00:43:21.829 --> 00:43:21.839 align:start position:0%
to pay for its expenditures when
 
00:43:24.829 --> 00:43:24.839 align:start position:0%
revenues are not up uh state agencies
 
00:43:27.650 --> 00:43:27.660 align:start position:0%
are directed to cut costs and we were
 
00:43:32.170 --> 00:43:32.180 align:start position:0%
directed to cut costs back in 2019 2020
 
00:43:35.210 --> 00:43:35.220 align:start position:0%
-2019 2020 and what was called a Labs
 
00:43:35.220 --> 00:43:35.890 align:start position:0%
-2019 2020 and what was called a Labs
Target

00:43:35.890 --> 00:43:35.900 align:start position:0%
Target
 
00:43:38.990 --> 00:43:39.000 align:start position:0%
meaning that we lapse significantly more
 
00:43:41.930 --> 00:43:41.940 align:start position:0%
than we would have liked to cover our
 
00:43:43.790 --> 00:43:43.800 align:start position:0%
operating expenses
 
00:43:45.589 --> 00:43:45.599 align:start position:0%
the concern I have with the cap is that
 
00:43:46.609 --> 00:43:46.619 align:start position:0%
does not
 
00:43:48.890 --> 00:43:48.900 align:start position:0%
um that does not eliminate that
 
00:43:51.050 --> 00:43:51.060 align:start position:0%
possibility from occurring by virtue of
 
00:43:53.089 --> 00:43:53.099 align:start position:0%
the fact that we would propose to Labs
 
00:43:55.370 --> 00:43:55.380 align:start position:0%
funds to the general fund
 
00:43:58.309 --> 00:43:58.319 align:start position:0%
um we are subject to having
 
00:44:00.230 --> 00:44:00.240 align:start position:0%
um you know directives to essentially
 
00:44:02.569 --> 00:44:02.579 align:start position:0%
cut expenditures so that we can lapse
 
00:44:04.250 --> 00:44:04.260 align:start position:0%
more into the general fund to cover
 
00:44:07.550 --> 00:44:07.560 align:start position:0%
general fund operating expenses
 
00:44:10.010 --> 00:44:10.020 align:start position:0%
and I would just note that the committee
 
00:44:12.670 --> 00:44:12.680 align:start position:0%
which was a bipartisan committee found
 
00:44:15.349 --> 00:44:15.359 align:start position:0%
that Surplus fees Beyond agency
 
00:44:17.329 --> 00:44:17.339 align:start position:0%
expenditures are lapsed into the general
 
00:44:20.089 --> 00:44:20.099 align:start position:0%
fund the lapsing of these funds does not
 
00:44:22.670 --> 00:44:22.680 align:start position:0%
serve any purpose for the licensee and
 
00:44:24.890 --> 00:44:24.900 align:start position:0%
only serves to continually drive up fees
 
00:44:27.170 --> 00:44:27.180 align:start position:0%
the Surplus is not the only area where
 
00:44:29.150 --> 00:44:29.160 align:start position:0%
fees are concerned
 
00:44:29.160 --> 00:44:30.710 align:start position:0%
fees are concerned
so

00:44:30.710 --> 00:44:30.720 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:44:33.170 --> 00:44:33.180 align:start position:0%
um we we can certainly work within a cap
 
00:44:34.849 --> 00:44:34.859 align:start position:0%
because I think a cap is better than
 
00:44:36.770 --> 00:44:36.780 align:start position:0%
nothing but
 
00:44:38.870 --> 00:44:38.880 align:start position:0%
um but the purpose of licensure fees is
 
00:44:41.329 --> 00:44:41.339 align:start position:0%
to fund licensure operations and and
 
00:44:43.490 --> 00:44:43.500 align:start position:0%
that's it it is not to fund other parts
 
00:44:45.589 --> 00:44:45.599 align:start position:0%
of state government or the general fund
 
00:44:48.410 --> 00:44:48.420 align:start position:0%
and that is what's happening
 
00:44:49.790 --> 00:44:49.800 align:start position:0%
um the other thing that I wish to
 
00:44:53.210 --> 00:44:53.220 align:start position:0%
mention is that unlike other Revenue
 
00:44:55.069 --> 00:44:55.079 align:start position:0%
generating self-funded agencies like
 
00:44:56.930 --> 00:44:56.940 align:start position:0%
liquor and Lottery we are not a revenue
 
00:45:00.230 --> 00:45:00.240 align:start position:0%
generating Agency on July 1 we have we
 
00:45:02.450 --> 00:45:02.460 align:start position:0%
have no no money
 
00:45:05.870 --> 00:45:05.880 align:start position:0%
um on June 30th uh the large portion of
 
00:45:08.450 --> 00:45:08.460 align:start position:0%
our renewal cycle ends and this year
 
00:45:11.390 --> 00:45:11.400 align:start position:0%
unless we have some statutory change all
 
00:45:14.510 --> 00:45:14.520 align:start position:0%
of our funds will lapse to the general
 
00:45:16.490 --> 00:45:16.500 align:start position:0%
fund and we will have zero dollars on
 
00:45:17.930 --> 00:45:17.940 align:start position:0%
July one
 
00:45:19.550 --> 00:45:19.560 align:start position:0%
it doesn't mean that we have zero
 
00:45:21.829 --> 00:45:21.839 align:start position:0%
expenses underly one so this is another
 
00:45:23.870 --> 00:45:23.880 align:start position:0%
reason why we at least least need a
 
00:45:27.109 --> 00:45:27.119 align:start position:0%
buffer because our renewal Cycles are
 
00:45:29.089 --> 00:45:29.099 align:start position:0%
not consistent we have major renewal
 
00:45:32.270 --> 00:45:32.280 align:start position:0%
Cycles in June of every year and in
 
00:45:34.490 --> 00:45:34.500 align:start position:0%
December and then throughout the year we
 
00:45:37.069 --> 00:45:37.079 align:start position:0%
receive initial applications and some
 
00:45:39.109 --> 00:45:39.119 align:start position:0%
renew like nursing and real estate
 
00:45:39.119 --> 00:45:41.089 align:start position:0%
renew like nursing and real estate
consistently

00:45:41.089 --> 00:45:41.099 align:start position:0%
consistently
 
00:45:42.950 --> 00:45:42.960 align:start position:0%
um and it's difficult to project our
 
00:45:45.290 --> 00:45:45.300 align:start position:0%
Revenue because some of our revenue is
 
00:45:48.170 --> 00:45:48.180 align:start position:0%
impacted by the market when the housing
 
00:45:50.450 --> 00:45:50.460 align:start position:0%
is is doing really well we see a huge
 
00:45:51.890 --> 00:45:51.900 align:start position:0%
influx in real estate applications
 
00:45:55.309 --> 00:45:55.319 align:start position:0%
because people want to enter that field
 
00:45:57.829 --> 00:45:57.839 align:start position:0%
um during covid we saw a significant
 
00:45:59.450 --> 00:45:59.460 align:start position:0%
increase in the number of healthcare
 
00:46:01.250 --> 00:46:01.260 align:start position:0%
professionals seeking licensure here by
 
00:46:04.250 --> 00:46:04.260 align:start position:0%
endorsement but it's it's difficult to
 
00:46:06.109 --> 00:46:06.119 align:start position:0%
project how many licensing applications
 
00:46:07.790 --> 00:46:07.800 align:start position:0%
we will receive and therefore difficult
 
00:46:09.950 --> 00:46:09.960 align:start position:0%
to project revenue and that's why it
 
00:46:12.650 --> 00:46:12.660 align:start position:0%
does not make sense to have the oplc
 
00:46:15.710 --> 00:46:15.720 align:start position:0%
operate on um you know starting with
 
00:46:19.309 --> 00:46:19.319 align:start position:0%
zero dollars on July one of a biennium
 
00:46:19.319 --> 00:46:21.890 align:start position:0%
zero dollars on July one of a biennium
um

00:46:21.890 --> 00:46:21.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:23.270 --> 00:46:23.280 align:start position:0%
I'd be happy to answer any other
 
00:46:25.069 --> 00:46:25.079 align:start position:0%
questions I'm sure you have some other
 
00:46:27.050 --> 00:46:27.060 align:start position:0%
questions with respect to the fiscal
 
00:46:29.630 --> 00:46:29.640 align:start position:0%
note that is exactly right uh we don't
 
00:46:33.470 --> 00:46:33.480 align:start position:0%
see a change in in the amount of monies
 
00:46:35.630 --> 00:46:35.640 align:start position:0%
um to the state it's just a change in in
 
00:46:39.050 --> 00:46:39.060 align:start position:0%
where those um those funds go
 
00:46:40.430 --> 00:46:40.440 align:start position:0%
but that would be happy to answer any
 
00:46:43.190 --> 00:46:43.200 align:start position:0%
questions representative Platt I can't
 
00:46:45.950 --> 00:46:45.960 align:start position:0%
resist for Barbara cosmetology you're
 
00:46:50.089 --> 00:46:50.099 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:52.849 --> 00:46:52.859 align:start position:0%
apologize representative all me
 
00:46:57.230 --> 00:46:57.240 align:start position:0%
Madam chair on well two things I hope
 
00:47:00.050 --> 00:47:00.060 align:start position:0%
that we could get Chris Shea to come and
 
00:47:02.630 --> 00:47:02.640 align:start position:0%
talk to us about that fiscal note
 
00:47:05.990 --> 00:47:06.000 align:start position:0%
before we finish this hearing and um he
 
00:47:07.550 --> 00:47:07.560 align:start position:0%
just walked in
 
00:47:10.309 --> 00:47:10.319 align:start position:0%
and the second is
 
00:47:10.319 --> 00:47:11.690 align:start position:0%
and the second is
um

00:47:11.690 --> 00:47:11.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:47:14.690 --> 00:47:14.700 align:start position:0%
there is on a
 
00:47:19.190 --> 00:47:19.200 align:start position:0%
major question that involves money that
 
00:47:21.410 --> 00:47:21.420 align:start position:0%
apparently is being dealt with or maybe
 
00:47:24.290 --> 00:47:24.300 align:start position:0%
it's not being dealt with in the bill
 
00:47:27.290 --> 00:47:27.300 align:start position:0%
that is going is sitting in the Senate
 
00:47:29.809 --> 00:47:29.819 align:start position:0%
now that the Ways and Means Committee
 
00:47:32.630 --> 00:47:32.640 align:start position:0%
didn't see uh
 
00:47:35.450 --> 00:47:35.460 align:start position:0%
about the um
 
00:47:38.510 --> 00:47:38.520 align:start position:0%
the fact that we've got I don't know how
 
00:47:41.470 --> 00:47:41.480 align:start position:0%
many agencies that are
 
00:47:44.329 --> 00:47:44.339 align:start position:0%
groups that are being are underfunding
 
00:47:48.530 --> 00:47:48.540 align:start position:0%
their costs uh some of them because the
 
00:47:50.990 --> 00:47:51.000 align:start position:0%
people in them don't get paid very much
 
00:47:53.750 --> 00:47:53.760 align:start position:0%
and can't really afford the higher
 
00:47:55.270 --> 00:47:55.280 align:start position:0%
higher costs
 
00:47:58.910 --> 00:47:58.920 align:start position:0%
uh and others which are paying way too
 
00:47:58.920 --> 00:48:00.770 align:start position:0%
uh and others which are paying way too
much

00:48:00.770 --> 00:48:00.780 align:start position:0%
much
 
00:48:03.230 --> 00:48:03.240 align:start position:0%
and also you mentioned plumbers someone
 
00:48:05.630 --> 00:48:05.640 align:start position:0%
mentioned plumbers and I think aren't
 
00:48:07.670 --> 00:48:07.680 align:start position:0%
the plumbers still under safety or did
 
00:48:09.950 --> 00:48:09.960 align:start position:0%
you manage to grab them
 
00:48:11.870 --> 00:48:11.880 align:start position:0%
um yes they were they were transferred
 
00:48:13.870 --> 00:48:13.880 align:start position:0%
over us I wouldn't call it a grab
 
00:48:16.250 --> 00:48:16.260 align:start position:0%
but yes they were transferred over to us
 
00:48:18.410 --> 00:48:18.420 align:start position:0%
at the last budget cycle
 
00:48:23.030 --> 00:48:23.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:23.040 --> 00:48:24.230 align:start position:0%
 
cosmetology

00:48:24.230 --> 00:48:24.240 align:start position:0%
cosmetology
 
00:48:27.230 --> 00:48:27.240 align:start position:0%
so will passage of this bill help you to
 
00:48:29.150 --> 00:48:29.160 align:start position:0%
address that issue
 
00:48:30.829 --> 00:48:30.839 align:start position:0%
so I think what helped us to address
 
00:48:32.390 --> 00:48:32.400 align:start position:0%
that issue
 
00:48:34.130 --> 00:48:34.140 align:start position:0%
um it's really just the large package
 
00:48:37.010 --> 00:48:37.020 align:start position:0%
that was the result of the study
 
00:48:39.589 --> 00:48:39.599 align:start position:0%
committee established by 3 30.
 
00:48:41.089 --> 00:48:41.099 align:start position:0%
um because although we've had statutory
 
00:48:43.069 --> 00:48:43.079 align:start position:0%
Authority and a statutory directive
 
00:48:45.950 --> 00:48:45.960 align:start position:0%
since 2015 to establish fees we have not
 
00:48:47.990 --> 00:48:48.000 align:start position:0%
had stakeholder consensus and that's
 
00:48:49.670 --> 00:48:49.680 align:start position:0%
part of the problem with oplc generally
 
00:48:51.290 --> 00:48:51.300 align:start position:0%
is that it was created as part of a
 
00:48:53.390 --> 00:48:53.400 align:start position:0%
budget cycle nobody wanted us to exist
 
00:48:55.130 --> 00:48:55.140 align:start position:0%
and that continued to persist for years
 
00:48:57.109 --> 00:48:57.119 align:start position:0%
and there's still a group of
 
00:48:59.210 --> 00:48:59.220 align:start position:0%
stakeholders that would like to see the
 
00:49:02.390 --> 00:49:02.400 align:start position:0%
board set fees I think that's largely
 
00:49:06.290 --> 00:49:06.300 align:start position:0%
been worked out by now and so our
 
00:49:08.930 --> 00:49:08.940 align:start position:0%
initial jail car filing that will
 
00:49:11.150 --> 00:49:11.160 align:start position:0%
hopefully be adopted fairly soon is to
 
00:49:14.030 --> 00:49:14.040 align:start position:0%
just codify all existing fees in one um
 
00:49:18.050 --> 00:49:18.060 align:start position:0%
one document and then starting July 1 we
 
00:49:21.230 --> 00:49:21.240 align:start position:0%
are going to be instituting with the
 
00:49:23.750 --> 00:49:23.760 align:start position:0%
advice of Bureau of accounts some time
 
00:49:25.250 --> 00:49:25.260 align:start position:0%
tracking analysis through our New
 
00:49:26.690 --> 00:49:26.700 align:start position:0%
Hampshire first portal so that we can
 
00:49:28.849 --> 00:49:28.859 align:start position:0%
appropriately allocate administrative
 
00:49:31.190 --> 00:49:31.200 align:start position:0%
costs back to the boards and provide a
 
00:49:32.690 --> 00:49:32.700 align:start position:0%
recommendation as to what we need to do
 
00:49:35.150 --> 00:49:35.160 align:start position:0%
to increase fees to represent
 
00:49:38.089 --> 00:49:38.099 align:start position:0%
representative almi's Point regarding
 
00:49:39.650 --> 00:49:39.660 align:start position:0%
um whether or not we should be
 
00:49:41.930 --> 00:49:41.940 align:start position:0%
subsidizing certain professions who may
 
00:49:44.710 --> 00:49:44.720 align:start position:0%
or may not make that much money or
 
00:49:46.730 --> 00:49:46.740 align:start position:0%
our understanding based on the
 
00:49:48.589 --> 00:49:48.599 align:start position:0%
legislation is we don't have statutory
 
00:49:50.089 --> 00:49:50.099 align:start position:0%
authority to do that and we're not
 
00:49:52.609 --> 00:49:52.619 align:start position:0%
seeking that statutory Authority follow
 
00:49:55.730 --> 00:49:55.740 align:start position:0%
up follow up so these changes are moving
 
00:49:57.589 --> 00:49:57.599 align:start position:0%
you in the right direction yes certainly
 
00:49:59.089 --> 00:49:59.099 align:start position:0%
representative thank you
 
00:49:59.099 --> 00:50:01.250 align:start position:0%
representative thank you
representative

00:50:01.250 --> 00:50:01.260 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:50:02.750 --> 00:50:02.760 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you for
 
00:50:03.890 --> 00:50:03.900 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
00:50:06.410 --> 00:50:06.420 align:start position:0%
um just logistically um you said on July
 
00:50:08.390 --> 00:50:08.400 align:start position:0%
1st your fund balance goes to zero so
 
00:50:11.030 --> 00:50:11.040 align:start position:0%
how are you paying bills in July or
 
00:50:12.589 --> 00:50:12.599 align:start position:0%
August for that matter
 
00:50:15.050 --> 00:50:15.060 align:start position:0%
yeah so we're I mean we're allowed to
 
00:50:17.089 --> 00:50:17.099 align:start position:0%
to pay Personnel costs we're allowed to
 
00:50:19.370 --> 00:50:19.380 align:start position:0%
go in the rad for a person lcos
 
00:50:22.430 --> 00:50:22.440 align:start position:0%
um so typically by by August uh we have
 
00:50:24.770 --> 00:50:24.780 align:start position:0%
enough funds to start covering our our
 
00:50:24.780 --> 00:50:26.030 align:start position:0%
enough funds to start covering our our
regular

00:50:26.030 --> 00:50:26.040 align:start position:0%
regular
 
00:50:26.040 --> 00:50:26.890 align:start position:0%
regular
um

00:50:26.890 --> 00:50:26.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:50:30.589 --> 00:50:30.599 align:start position:0%
expenses if you will but we don't
 
00:50:34.730 --> 00:50:34.740 align:start position:0%
um we don't seek contracts out you know
 
00:50:36.230 --> 00:50:36.240 align:start position:0%
typically in the August September time
 
00:50:36.240 --> 00:50:37.730 align:start position:0%
typically in the August September time
frame

00:50:37.730 --> 00:50:37.740 align:start position:0%
frame
 
00:50:39.829 --> 00:50:39.839 align:start position:0%
representative spilsbury
 
00:50:42.530 --> 00:50:42.540 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair the way I read the
 
00:50:42.540 --> 00:50:43.550 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair the way I read the
bill

00:50:43.550 --> 00:50:43.560 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:50:46.970 --> 00:50:46.980 align:start position:0%
it essentially creates a four-tier
 
00:50:51.829 --> 00:50:51.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:53.870 --> 00:50:53.880 align:start position:0%
please confirm this if if I'm
 
00:50:56.270 --> 00:50:56.280 align:start position:0%
understanding it correctly
 
00:51:00.530 --> 00:51:00.540 align:start position:0%
so basically when fees uh are derived
 
00:51:02.390 --> 00:51:02.400 align:start position:0%
they go first to paying costs and
 
00:51:02.400 --> 00:51:03.349 align:start position:0%
they go first to paying costs and
salaries

00:51:03.349 --> 00:51:03.359 align:start position:0%
salaries
 
00:51:06.109 --> 00:51:06.119 align:start position:0%
correct and then as the bill says any
 
00:51:07.910 --> 00:51:07.920 align:start position:0%
remaining funds
 
00:51:10.970 --> 00:51:10.980 align:start position:0%
shall be used for Capital expenditures
 
00:51:14.630 --> 00:51:14.640 align:start position:0%
yes and then the bill goes on to say
 
00:51:17.150 --> 00:51:17.160 align:start position:0%
that you can keep up to three million
 
00:51:17.160 --> 00:51:18.470 align:start position:0%
that you can keep up to three million
dollars

00:51:18.470 --> 00:51:18.480 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
00:51:21.470 --> 00:51:21.480 align:start position:0%
I guess it's a reserve and then fourth
 
00:51:23.329 --> 00:51:23.339 align:start position:0%
any funds in excess of the three million
 
00:51:24.710 --> 00:51:24.720 align:start position:0%
dollar cap
 
00:51:27.650 --> 00:51:27.660 align:start position:0%
shall be used to reduce licensing and
 
00:51:29.750 --> 00:51:29.760 align:start position:0%
certification fees and as Senator Lang
 
00:51:31.309 --> 00:51:31.319 align:start position:0%
said you could
 
00:51:34.790 --> 00:51:34.800 align:start position:0%
deploy those for reductions before you
 
00:51:37.130 --> 00:51:37.140 align:start position:0%
reach the cap but you must deploy them
 
00:51:39.230 --> 00:51:39.240 align:start position:0%
for reductions once you've reached the
 
00:51:42.170 --> 00:51:42.180 align:start position:0%
Gap correct is that all correct yeah put
 
00:51:46.010 --> 00:51:46.020 align:start position:0%
that cap just as well be one million
 
00:51:47.990 --> 00:51:48.000 align:start position:0%
I think the cap could definitely be one
 
00:51:49.250 --> 00:51:49.260 align:start position:0%
million I think when we talk about
 
00:51:53.450 --> 00:51:53.460 align:start position:0%
oplc's budget a million dollars is not
 
00:51:56.270 --> 00:51:56.280 align:start position:0%
significant after all it's already not
 
00:51:58.609 --> 00:51:58.619 align:start position:0%
only met the operating costs and
 
00:52:02.030 --> 00:52:02.040 align:start position:0%
salaries it's also been available for
 
00:52:04.250 --> 00:52:04.260 align:start position:0%
Capital expenditures before it even
 
00:52:07.670 --> 00:52:07.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:10.490 --> 00:52:10.500 align:start position:0%
well the way I read this is that the
 
00:52:12.829 --> 00:52:12.839 align:start position:0%
capital expenditures could only be up to
 
00:52:14.329 --> 00:52:14.339 align:start position:0%
three million dollars because the
 
00:52:15.950 --> 00:52:15.960 align:start position:0%
capital expenditures has to reside
 
00:52:17.510 --> 00:52:17.520 align:start position:0%
somewhere and so that would have to be
 
00:52:21.950 --> 00:52:21.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:25.250 --> 00:52:25.260 align:start position:0%
and I think that's the issue from our
 
00:52:28.549 --> 00:52:28.559 align:start position:0%
perspective uh software typically the
 
00:52:30.349 --> 00:52:30.359 align:start position:0%
last time the state procured software is
 
00:52:32.329 --> 00:52:32.339 align:start position:0%
in the 3.7 million dollar range there
 
00:52:34.250 --> 00:52:34.260 align:start position:0%
was a significant amount of some for um
 
00:52:37.190 --> 00:52:37.200 align:start position:0%
some of uh funding for development work
 
00:52:39.770 --> 00:52:39.780 align:start position:0%
and likely we will need to amend that to
 
00:52:41.930 --> 00:52:41.940 align:start position:0%
increase it but there are other Capital
 
00:52:44.089 --> 00:52:44.099 align:start position:0%
expenditures that I think could be in
 
00:52:46.549 --> 00:52:46.559 align:start position:0%
excess of a million dollars and
 
00:52:48.410 --> 00:52:48.420 align:start position:0%
three million dollars so if I can just
 
00:52:48.420 --> 00:52:50.329 align:start position:0%
three million dollars so if I can just
clarify

00:52:50.329 --> 00:52:50.339 align:start position:0%
clarify
 
00:52:53.630 --> 00:52:53.640 align:start position:0%
um you are saying that the allowance for
 
00:52:55.549 --> 00:52:55.559 align:start position:0%
retaining up to 3 million is
 
00:52:57.109 --> 00:52:57.119 align:start position:0%
specifically for the purpose of covering
 
00:52:58.910 --> 00:52:58.920 align:start position:0%
Capital expenditures
 
00:53:00.589 --> 00:53:00.599 align:start position:0%
and I understand Capital expenditures
 
00:53:02.870 --> 00:53:02.880 align:start position:0%
going back to what was raised before as
 
00:53:05.390 --> 00:53:05.400 align:start position:0%
being essentially those that involve
 
00:53:07.370 --> 00:53:07.380 align:start position:0%
more than the current
 
00:53:10.010 --> 00:53:10.020 align:start position:0%
uh year something that is expended or
 
00:53:13.430 --> 00:53:13.440 align:start position:0%
has a life cycle of more than one year
 
00:53:15.109 --> 00:53:15.119 align:start position:0%
correct the way I'm reading this and I
 
00:53:16.250 --> 00:53:16.260 align:start position:0%
could be wrong but the way we would
 
00:53:18.530 --> 00:53:18.540 align:start position:0%
interpret it in the office is that we
 
00:53:20.390 --> 00:53:20.400 align:start position:0%
have our operation our operational
 
00:53:23.410 --> 00:53:23.420 align:start position:0%
expenses which are approved by the house
 
00:53:26.690 --> 00:53:26.700 align:start position:0%
and the Senate and the governor GNC
 
00:53:28.970 --> 00:53:28.980 align:start position:0%
contracts and the like and that anything
 
00:53:32.089 --> 00:53:32.099 align:start position:0%
in excess we currently retain in our
 
00:53:34.130 --> 00:53:34.140 align:start position:0%
operating accounts
 
00:53:36.950 --> 00:53:36.960 align:start position:0%
um and we we could do that up to three
 
00:53:38.870 --> 00:53:38.880 align:start position:0%
million dollars for the purpose of
 
00:53:41.150 --> 00:53:41.160 align:start position:0%
capital expenditures but anything beyond
 
00:53:43.790 --> 00:53:43.800 align:start position:0%
that we would not be able to retain past
 
00:53:47.569 --> 00:53:47.579 align:start position:0%
the biennium is how I read that
 
00:53:50.390 --> 00:53:50.400 align:start position:0%
representative Olney
 
00:53:55.849 --> 00:53:55.859 align:start position:0%
thank you and actually it as I read it
 
00:53:58.970 --> 00:53:58.980 align:start position:0%
on if at the end of the biennium you
 
00:54:01.910 --> 00:54:01.920 align:start position:0%
keep three million dollars you have
 
00:54:04.370 --> 00:54:04.380 align:start position:0%
until the end of the next biennium to
 
00:54:09.530 --> 00:54:09.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:12.230 --> 00:54:12.240 align:start position:0%
if you had a major software purchase
 
00:54:14.270 --> 00:54:14.280 align:start position:0%
that had to be made or something like
 
00:54:17.210 --> 00:54:17.220 align:start position:0%
that I I appreciate the reading of that
 
00:54:19.069 --> 00:54:19.079 align:start position:0%
I don't think we would interpret it to
 
00:54:23.030 --> 00:54:23.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:25.549 --> 00:54:25.559 align:start position:0%
I I think the the
 
00:54:27.770 --> 00:54:27.780 align:start position:0%
I think the intent is clear that that
 
00:54:29.210 --> 00:54:29.220 align:start position:0%
anything in excess of three million
 
00:54:30.109 --> 00:54:30.119 align:start position:0%
we're supposed to use to reduce
 
00:54:32.170 --> 00:54:32.180 align:start position:0%
licensing fees something that we support
 
00:54:34.490 --> 00:54:34.500 align:start position:0%
that said we can only reduce licensing
 
00:54:36.290 --> 00:54:36.300 align:start position:0%
fees if we're requiring others to
 
00:54:37.970 --> 00:54:37.980 align:start position:0%
actually increase their licensing fees
 
00:54:40.130 --> 00:54:40.140 align:start position:0%
so the one the one thing I want to leave
 
00:54:41.569 --> 00:54:41.579 align:start position:0%
this committee with is that there are
 
00:54:41.579 --> 00:54:42.589 align:start position:0%
this committee with is that there are
some

00:54:42.589 --> 00:54:42.599 align:start position:0%
some
 
00:54:44.329 --> 00:54:44.339 align:start position:0%
um uh professions that are paying well
 
00:54:45.950 --> 00:54:45.960 align:start position:0%
in advance of what they should be paying
 
00:54:47.510 --> 00:54:47.520 align:start position:0%
and then there are some that are not
 
00:54:49.130 --> 00:54:49.140 align:start position:0%
paying nearly enough and so that's
 
00:54:50.990 --> 00:54:51.000 align:start position:0%
that's part of what we're grappling with
 
00:54:52.910 --> 00:54:52.920 align:start position:0%
in the office
 
00:54:54.410 --> 00:54:54.420 align:start position:0%
um but I would read the intent of this
 
00:54:55.549 --> 00:54:55.559 align:start position:0%
legislation and I think that's
 
00:54:57.410 --> 00:54:57.420 align:start position:0%
consistent with the discussions at the
 
00:55:01.370 --> 00:55:01.380 align:start position:0%
by the Senate um committee is that we
 
00:55:04.250 --> 00:55:04.260 align:start position:0%
should be reducing licensing fees
 
00:55:08.270 --> 00:55:08.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:11.390 --> 00:55:11.400 align:start position:0%
follow up are you tackling the question
 
00:55:15.049 --> 00:55:15.059 align:start position:0%
of the groups that are being licensed
 
00:55:17.569 --> 00:55:17.579 align:start position:0%
that um
 
00:55:19.849 --> 00:55:19.859 align:start position:0%
include people who are earning very
 
00:55:21.770 --> 00:55:21.780 align:start position:0%
little money
 
00:55:21.780 --> 00:55:23.089 align:start position:0%
little money
and

00:55:23.089 --> 00:55:23.099 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:55:26.930 --> 00:55:26.940 align:start position:0%
if you have to increase the cost of the
 
00:55:29.270 --> 00:55:29.280 align:start position:0%
licenses a lot of them may drop out of
 
00:55:31.750 --> 00:55:31.760 align:start position:0%
whatever it is
 
00:55:31.760 --> 00:55:33.349 align:start position:0%
whatever it is
so

00:55:33.349 --> 00:55:33.359 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:55:35.930 --> 00:55:35.940 align:start position:0%
um here are my thoughts on that
 
00:55:35.940 --> 00:55:36.950 align:start position:0%
um here are my thoughts on that
um

00:55:36.950 --> 00:55:36.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:55:39.829 --> 00:55:39.839 align:start position:0%
under the 125 analysis which is
 
00:55:41.750 --> 00:55:41.760 align:start position:0%
presently in statute
 
00:55:44.390 --> 00:55:44.400 align:start position:0%
um each profession or each regulatory
 
00:55:47.030 --> 00:55:47.040 align:start position:0%
board has to support its own costs
 
00:55:50.329 --> 00:55:50.339 align:start position:0%
anything above 125 percent is considered
 
00:55:52.370 --> 00:55:52.380 align:start position:0%
an unconstitutional tax
 
00:55:55.609 --> 00:55:55.619 align:start position:0%
so essentially by lowering fees let's
 
00:55:58.069 --> 00:55:58.079 align:start position:0%
say for a profession for barbering at 40
 
00:55:58.079 --> 00:55:59.049 align:start position:0%
say for a profession for barbering at 40
percent

00:55:59.049 --> 00:55:59.059 align:start position:0%
percent
 
00:56:01.549 --> 00:56:01.559 align:start position:0%
you're asking another profession to
 
00:56:03.530 --> 00:56:03.540 align:start position:0%
subsidize the cost of another profession
 
00:56:05.990 --> 00:56:06.000 align:start position:0%
our current statutory framework does not
 
00:56:08.089 --> 00:56:08.099 align:start position:0%
allow that because that would be
 
00:56:10.130 --> 00:56:10.140 align:start position:0%
considered a tax and so I think it would
 
00:56:11.750 --> 00:56:11.760 align:start position:0%
be up to the legislature to make that
 
00:56:13.430 --> 00:56:13.440 align:start position:0%
determination as to whether certain
 
00:56:15.470 --> 00:56:15.480 align:start position:0%
professions should be subsidizing other
 
00:56:17.329 --> 00:56:17.339 align:start position:0%
professions but at present that's not
 
00:56:19.549 --> 00:56:19.559 align:start position:0%
part of our analysis
 
00:56:22.010 --> 00:56:22.020 align:start position:0%
representative what yes I have a serious
 
00:56:25.609 --> 00:56:25.619 align:start position:0%
question this time when you uh go into
 
00:56:28.010 --> 00:56:28.020 align:start position:0%
deficit July and August how deep a
 
00:56:28.020 --> 00:56:29.150 align:start position:0%
deficit July and August how deep a
deficit

00:56:29.150 --> 00:56:29.160 align:start position:0%
deficit
 
00:56:30.770 --> 00:56:30.780 align:start position:0%
I would have to bring those numbers back
 
00:56:32.210 --> 00:56:32.220 align:start position:0%
to you representative
 
00:56:34.849 --> 00:56:34.859 align:start position:0%
that was aimed at questioning whether 3
 
00:56:38.329 --> 00:56:38.339 align:start position:0%
million was enough too much whatever
 
00:56:39.710 --> 00:56:39.720 align:start position:0%
three million is certainly enough to
 
00:56:41.510 --> 00:56:41.520 align:start position:0%
cover any sort of deficit in July and
 
00:56:41.520 --> 00:56:43.370 align:start position:0%
cover any sort of deficit in July and
August

00:56:43.370 --> 00:56:43.380 align:start position:0%
August
 
00:56:44.750 --> 00:56:44.760 align:start position:0%
I just remind the committee that we've
 
00:56:46.430 --> 00:56:46.440 align:start position:0%
already done the hospital on this and we
 
00:56:48.349 --> 00:56:48.359 align:start position:0%
voted for it
 
00:56:50.390 --> 00:56:50.400 align:start position:0%
when we decided on the three million cap
 
00:56:53.270 --> 00:56:53.280 align:start position:0%
I understand but I'm not sure what basis
 
00:56:55.069 --> 00:56:55.079 align:start position:0%
we had for the three million and so I
 
00:56:57.049 --> 00:56:57.059 align:start position:0%
was going at basis yeah and that's
 
00:56:58.910 --> 00:56:58.920 align:start position:0%
because it was the the typical average
 
00:57:01.970 --> 00:57:01.980 align:start position:0%
and we should have notes on that other
 
00:57:04.670 --> 00:57:04.680 align:start position:0%
questions yes representative ORS thank
 
00:57:06.410 --> 00:57:06.420 align:start position:0%
you madam chair and thanks for taking my
 
00:57:08.569 --> 00:57:08.579 align:start position:0%
question so I I missed the number the
 
00:57:10.010 --> 00:57:10.020 align:start position:0%
last time you did a major computer
 
00:57:14.150 --> 00:57:14.160 align:start position:0%
upgrade what was the cost it was 3.7
 
00:57:16.309 --> 00:57:16.319 align:start position:0%
um and that was at
 
00:57:19.010 --> 00:57:19.020 align:start position:0%
Statewide Enterprise solution so it's a
 
00:57:21.049 --> 00:57:21.059 align:start position:0%
doit contract it wouldn't be under the
 
00:57:21.059 --> 00:57:22.670 align:start position:0%
doit contract it wouldn't be under the
office

00:57:22.670 --> 00:57:22.680 align:start position:0%
office
 
00:57:23.990 --> 00:57:24.000 align:start position:0%
um but what we're already discovering
 
00:57:26.569 --> 00:57:26.579 align:start position:0%
through our internal controls
 
00:57:29.450 --> 00:57:29.460 align:start position:0%
um projects is that many of the boards
 
00:57:31.730 --> 00:57:31.740 align:start position:0%
have obligations to license professions
 
00:57:33.890 --> 00:57:33.900 align:start position:0%
that they have not necessarily been
 
00:57:36.589 --> 00:57:36.599 align:start position:0%
enforcing and so we have to increase the
 
00:57:38.870 --> 00:57:38.880 align:start position:0%
number of licensed professions within
 
00:57:42.470 --> 00:57:42.480 align:start position:0%
that contract and so 3.7 is likely the
 
00:57:45.109 --> 00:57:45.119 align:start position:0%
ceiling and what year was that that was
 
00:57:47.690 --> 00:57:47.700 align:start position:0%
just last year okay and we likely will
 
00:57:49.910 --> 00:57:49.920 align:start position:0%
go out to bid for the procurement of the
 
00:57:51.530 --> 00:57:51.540 align:start position:0%
next contract within the next year or
 
00:57:51.540 --> 00:57:54.049 align:start position:0%
next contract within the next year or
two

00:57:54.049 --> 00:57:54.059 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:56.750 --> 00:57:56.760 align:start position:0%
other questions representative Ames has
 
00:57:58.130 --> 00:57:58.140 align:start position:0%
is up
 
00:58:00.410 --> 00:58:00.420 align:start position:0%
yeah just an easy one I
 
00:58:03.349 --> 00:58:03.359 align:start position:0%
um and maybe it's been answered but the
 
00:58:05.990 --> 00:58:06.000 align:start position:0%
Senate the bill that's now in the Senate
 
00:58:08.390 --> 00:58:08.400 align:start position:0%
do you have the number for that yes it's
 
00:58:10.490 --> 00:58:10.500 align:start position:0%
House Bill 655 it's currently before
 
00:58:14.870 --> 00:58:14.880 align:start position:0%
Senate Finance 655. thank you
 
00:58:17.510 --> 00:58:17.520 align:start position:0%
representative fellows
 
00:58:19.670 --> 00:58:19.680 align:start position:0%
yes thank you madam chair
 
00:58:23.930 --> 00:58:23.940 align:start position:0%
um can I'm concerned interested in how
 
00:58:26.809 --> 00:58:26.819 align:start position:0%
to get the fees back in line with where
 
00:58:30.349 --> 00:58:30.359 align:start position:0%
they should be so I know the 125 percent
 
00:58:32.390 --> 00:58:32.400 align:start position:0%
is somewhere in statute
 
00:58:35.210 --> 00:58:35.220 align:start position:0%
does and I know it has something to do
 
00:58:37.730 --> 00:58:37.740 align:start position:0%
with the court ruling that is that
 
00:58:39.829 --> 00:58:39.839 align:start position:0%
correct well
 
00:58:39.839 --> 00:58:40.490 align:start position:0%
correct well
um

00:58:40.490 --> 00:58:40.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:58:43.490 --> 00:58:43.500 align:start position:0%
the court did rule that yes correct um
 
00:58:44.930 --> 00:58:44.940 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure that the statute is based
 
00:58:47.089 --> 00:58:47.099 align:start position:0%
on the court ruling or vice versa but um
 
00:58:48.950 --> 00:58:48.960 align:start position:0%
it applies to all boards whether it be
 
00:58:50.990 --> 00:58:51.000 align:start position:0%
in a court ruling or
 
00:58:51.000 --> 00:58:52.549 align:start position:0%
in a court ruling or
um statute

00:58:52.549 --> 00:58:52.559 align:start position:0%
um statute
 
00:58:52.559 --> 00:58:53.750 align:start position:0%
um statute
so

00:58:53.750 --> 00:58:53.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:58:55.970 --> 00:58:55.980 align:start position:0%
so the requirement
 
00:58:55.980 --> 00:58:58.030 align:start position:0%
so the requirement
for

00:58:58.030 --> 00:58:58.040 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:59:00.670 --> 00:59:00.680 align:start position:0%
125 percent is
 
00:59:03.049 --> 00:59:03.059 align:start position:0%
per board
 
00:59:07.910 --> 00:59:07.920 align:start position:0%
or is it per all of oplc Erie is an
 
00:59:09.349 --> 00:59:09.359 align:start position:0%
interesting point
 
00:59:09.359 --> 00:59:10.910 align:start position:0%
interesting point
um

00:59:10.910 --> 00:59:10.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:59:13.549 --> 00:59:13.559 align:start position:0%
I understand it to be per board
 
00:59:17.030 --> 00:59:17.040 align:start position:0%
um I think we would see a
 
00:59:17.040 --> 00:59:19.329 align:start position:0%
um I think we would see a
um

00:59:19.329 --> 00:59:19.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:22.309 --> 00:59:22.319 align:start position:0%
I think stakeholders would be
 
00:59:24.770 --> 00:59:24.780 align:start position:0%
um concerned if the interpretation was
 
00:59:27.530 --> 00:59:27.540 align:start position:0%
at the it only applies to the agency
 
00:59:30.049 --> 00:59:30.059 align:start position:0%
there continues to be you know a lack of
 
00:59:32.870 --> 00:59:32.880 align:start position:0%
consensus as to what oplc should be able
 
00:59:34.490 --> 00:59:34.500 align:start position:0%
to control versus what the boards and I
 
00:59:35.809 --> 00:59:35.819 align:start position:0%
think the feedback that we've gotten
 
00:59:38.329 --> 00:59:38.339 align:start position:0%
from a lot of boards and from
 
00:59:40.789 --> 00:59:40.799 align:start position:0%
um the legislature and from stakeholders
 
00:59:43.250 --> 00:59:43.260 align:start position:0%
is that the fees of our particular
 
00:59:45.289 --> 00:59:45.299 align:start position:0%
profession should be used only for that
 
00:59:48.890 --> 00:59:48.900 align:start position:0%
profession and not for other professions
 
00:59:52.250 --> 00:59:52.260 align:start position:0%
but follow up follow up so but what
 
00:59:54.049 --> 00:59:54.059 align:start position:0%
you're telling me is what what the
 
00:59:56.329 --> 00:59:56.339 align:start position:0%
public wants it's not like it's not
 
00:59:58.730 --> 00:59:58.740 align:start position:0%
because of the Court ruling I'm just
 
01:00:00.170 --> 01:00:00.180 align:start position:0%
trying to figure out no what I'm saying
 
01:00:02.750 --> 01:00:02.760 align:start position:0%
is the ex the existing statute requires
 
01:00:04.549 --> 01:00:04.559 align:start position:0%
that each profession
 
01:00:06.710 --> 01:00:06.720 align:start position:0%
um support itself
 
01:00:10.190 --> 01:00:10.200 align:start position:0%
so profession so that means you have a
 
01:00:12.230 --> 01:00:12.240 align:start position:0%
board you know
 
01:00:14.750 --> 01:00:14.760 align:start position:0%
um the cosmetology and The Barbers and
 
01:00:16.609 --> 01:00:16.619 align:start position:0%
whatever they're all multiple
 
01:00:19.250 --> 01:00:19.260 align:start position:0%
professions are in one board I'm using
 
01:00:20.870 --> 01:00:20.880 align:start position:0%
the term profession Loosely I apologize
 
01:00:22.970 --> 01:00:22.980 align:start position:0%
representative each board is required to
 
01:00:25.490 --> 01:00:25.500 align:start position:0%
support itself and within each board
 
01:00:28.069 --> 01:00:28.079 align:start position:0%
they have multiple professions and they
 
01:00:29.390 --> 01:00:29.400 align:start position:0%
can choose whether they would like to
 
01:00:30.890 --> 01:00:30.900 align:start position:0%
subsidize certain license tapes or
 
01:00:34.069 --> 01:00:34.079 align:start position:0%
others and for example nursing has
 
01:00:36.890 --> 01:00:36.900 align:start position:0%
chosen to subsidize lnas
 
01:00:40.870 --> 01:00:40.880 align:start position:0%
um and and charge aprns and RNs more
 
01:00:44.990 --> 01:00:45.000 align:start position:0%
that that is their choice but what what
 
01:00:48.130 --> 01:00:48.140 align:start position:0%
is improper at least our interpretation
 
01:00:51.410 --> 01:00:51.420 align:start position:0%
with the advice of doj under the statute
 
01:00:54.349 --> 01:00:54.359 align:start position:0%
is to say pharmacies which pay two
 
01:00:55.910 --> 01:00:55.920 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars if they're a mail order
 
01:00:58.789 --> 01:00:58.799 align:start position:0%
pharmacy have to cover the cost of lnas
 
01:01:02.690 --> 01:01:02.700 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:02.700 --> 01:01:08.089 align:start position:0%
 
representative

01:01:08.089 --> 01:01:08.099 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:11.270 --> 01:01:11.280 align:start position:0%
also doj told you it's okay for
 
01:01:13.370 --> 01:01:13.380 align:start position:0%
pharmacies to cover some of the costs
 
01:01:16.069 --> 01:01:16.079 align:start position:0%
for lnas no that's the opposite of what
 
01:01:18.410 --> 01:01:18.420 align:start position:0%
I said a doj has advised that each board
 
01:01:20.450 --> 01:01:20.460 align:start position:0%
has to cover its own costs based on
 
01:01:22.130 --> 01:01:22.140 align:start position:0%
their interpretation of the statute and
 
01:01:24.770 --> 01:01:24.780 align:start position:0%
we agree with that interpretation so we
 
01:01:27.289 --> 01:01:27.299 align:start position:0%
we cannot require that Pharmacy for
 
01:01:29.750 --> 01:01:29.760 align:start position:0%
example just an example subsidize other
 
01:01:33.109 --> 01:01:33.119 align:start position:0%
professions like helenase and just as
 
01:01:36.349 --> 01:01:36.359 align:start position:0%
the last part of this is is this process
 
01:01:39.349 --> 01:01:39.359 align:start position:0%
for determining what the fees should be
 
01:01:41.329 --> 01:01:41.339 align:start position:0%
for each profession or you know with
 
01:01:44.030 --> 01:01:44.040 align:start position:0%
within the board are there rules related
 
01:01:45.770 --> 01:01:45.780 align:start position:0%
to that
 
01:01:45.780 --> 01:01:47.150 align:start position:0%
to that
so

01:01:47.150 --> 01:01:47.160 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:01:48.950 --> 01:01:48.960 align:start position:0%
um our
 
01:01:52.549 --> 01:01:52.559 align:start position:0%
this has been a long-standing project
 
01:01:55.190 --> 01:01:55.200 align:start position:0%
um there's a statute that requires us to
 
01:01:58.609 --> 01:01:58.619 align:start position:0%
seek a stakeholder and board feedback we
 
01:02:02.569 --> 01:02:02.579 align:start position:0%
began this process back in 2021 that's
 
01:02:02.579 --> 01:02:03.710 align:start position:0%
began this process back in 2021 that's
what

01:02:03.710 --> 01:02:03.720 align:start position:0%
what
 
01:02:06.530 --> 01:02:06.540 align:start position:0%
um led to a modification of Senate Bill
 
01:02:09.170 --> 01:02:09.180 align:start position:0%
330 actually and created a committee to
 
01:02:10.670 --> 01:02:10.680 align:start position:0%
study the issue because there were
 
01:02:12.970 --> 01:02:12.980 align:start position:0%
stakeholder feedback
 
01:02:14.809 --> 01:02:14.819 align:start position:0%
and then
 
01:02:14.819 --> 01:02:15.789 align:start position:0%
and then
um

01:02:15.789 --> 01:02:15.799 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:02:18.950 --> 01:02:18.960 align:start position:0%
we decided first rather than having
 
01:02:22.010 --> 01:02:22.020 align:start position:0%
rules in 54 different sets of rules that
 
01:02:24.349 --> 01:02:24.359 align:start position:0%
we would take the existing statutory and
 
01:02:26.030 --> 01:02:26.040 align:start position:0%
Regulatory fees and put them in one
 
01:02:28.130 --> 01:02:28.140 align:start position:0%
document that is currently before jail
 
01:02:30.410 --> 01:02:30.420 align:start position:0%
car and there's with few minor
 
01:02:33.109 --> 01:02:33.119 align:start position:0%
exceptions very few modifications to
 
01:02:33.119 --> 01:02:34.670 align:start position:0%
exceptions very few modifications to
fees

01:02:34.670 --> 01:02:34.680 align:start position:0%
fees
 
01:02:36.890 --> 01:02:36.900 align:start position:0%
um and then the next step is going to be
 
01:02:38.630 --> 01:02:38.640 align:start position:0%
changing the
 
01:02:40.849 --> 01:02:40.859 align:start position:0%
um how we uh
 
01:02:45.349 --> 01:02:45.359 align:start position:0%
cover or how we assess our time in the
 
01:02:48.010 --> 01:02:48.020 align:start position:0%
office and then
 
01:02:52.069 --> 01:02:52.079 align:start position:0%
redo the allocation of shared costs so
 
01:02:54.410 --> 01:02:54.420 align:start position:0%
that we can provide boards with their
 
01:02:57.109 --> 01:02:57.119 align:start position:0%
total costs operating costs for the
 
01:03:01.549 --> 01:03:01.559 align:start position:0%
biennium so that then we can propose new
 
01:03:04.430 --> 01:03:04.440 align:start position:0%
fees and we likely will have to do that
 
01:03:06.589 --> 01:03:06.599 align:start position:0%
fairly soon over the course of a
 
01:03:08.690 --> 01:03:08.700 align:start position:0%
six-month period
 
01:03:08.700 --> 01:03:10.370 align:start position:0%
six-month period
um

01:03:10.370 --> 01:03:10.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:03:12.410 --> 01:03:12.420 align:start position:0%
in order to make sure that all boards
 
01:03:13.910 --> 01:03:13.920 align:start position:0%
are are covering their costs and other
 
01:03:17.750 --> 01:03:17.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:17.760 --> 01:03:20.630 align:start position:0%
 
representative

01:03:20.630 --> 01:03:20.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:24.410 --> 01:03:24.420 align:start position:0%
things what court judgment is this new
 
01:03:27.890 --> 01:03:27.900 align:start position:0%
no it was a Supreme Court case
 
01:03:31.130 --> 01:03:31.140 align:start position:0%
um 30 40 years yes and I forget the name
 
01:03:33.109 --> 01:03:33.119 align:start position:0%
one that we've been operating under
 
01:03:35.870 --> 01:03:35.880 align:start position:0%
correct representative
 
01:03:40.670 --> 01:03:40.680 align:start position:0%
uh and then the other one is um
 
01:03:46.089 --> 01:03:46.099 align:start position:0%
they're under the on
 
01:03:46.099 --> 01:03:47.690 align:start position:0%
they're under the on
hb655

01:03:47.690 --> 01:03:47.700 align:start position:0%
hb655
 
01:03:50.930 --> 01:03:50.940 align:start position:0%
are you given authority to
 
01:03:54.049 --> 01:03:54.059 align:start position:0%
um on deconstruct
 
01:03:56.809 --> 01:03:56.819 align:start position:0%
some of the boards under your
 
01:03:59.750 --> 01:03:59.760 align:start position:0%
purview what do you mean by deconstructs
 
01:04:05.030 --> 01:04:05.040 align:start position:0%
well on uh end oh no uh
 
01:04:06.770 --> 01:04:06.780 align:start position:0%
oh no we wouldn't
 
01:04:08.809 --> 01:04:08.819 align:start position:0%
um no that that has not been proposed
 
01:04:11.569 --> 01:04:11.579 align:start position:0%
what was proposed in hp2 is to eliminate
 
01:04:13.370 --> 01:04:13.380 align:start position:0%
certain boards
 
01:04:15.109 --> 01:04:15.119 align:start position:0%
um I think that was largely taken out
 
01:04:17.390 --> 01:04:17.400 align:start position:0%
but there's nothing in 655 that would
 
01:04:20.030 --> 01:04:20.040 align:start position:0%
propose to repeal uh statutes
 
01:04:23.150 --> 01:04:23.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:25.250 --> 01:04:25.260 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:04:28.010 --> 01:04:28.020 align:start position:0%
other questions from the committee
 
01:04:29.690 --> 01:04:29.700 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much
 
01:04:31.670 --> 01:04:31.680 align:start position:0%
appreciate it and I would remind folks
 
01:04:33.650 --> 01:04:33.660 align:start position:0%
to just look back at your notes from the
 
01:04:35.510 --> 01:04:35.520 align:start position:0%
last bill that we dealt with was very
 
01:04:38.870 --> 01:04:38.880 align:start position:0%
very similar to this as we go for it
 
01:04:41.630 --> 01:04:41.640 align:start position:0%
okay any other uh representative Army
 
01:04:44.210 --> 01:04:44.220 align:start position:0%
could we ask Chris Shea to come and
 
01:04:47.150 --> 01:04:47.160 align:start position:0%
explain the fiscal note to us
 
01:04:50.569 --> 01:04:50.579 align:start position:0%
I don't know if he's uh prepared to do
 
01:04:53.030 --> 01:04:53.040 align:start position:0%
that of what we were talking about
 
01:04:55.309 --> 01:04:55.319 align:start position:0%
before you showed up but Chris I don't
 
01:04:56.750 --> 01:04:56.760 align:start position:0%
know if you're aware we're on Senate
 
01:04:59.210 --> 01:04:59.220 align:start position:0%
Bill 49 right
 
01:04:59.220 --> 01:05:00.770 align:start position:0%
Bill 49 right
and

01:05:00.770 --> 01:05:00.780 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:05:05.329 --> 01:05:05.339 align:start position:0%
it is quite clear that the lapse to the
 
01:05:08.049 --> 01:05:08.059 align:start position:0%
general fund at the end of next year
 
01:05:12.950 --> 01:05:12.960 align:start position:0%
will be will uh disappear and it's 6.5
 
01:05:17.870 --> 01:05:17.880 align:start position:0%
to 8 million dollars estimate on why is
 
01:05:17.880 --> 01:05:19.010 align:start position:0%
to 8 million dollars estimate on why is
the

01:05:19.010 --> 01:05:19.020 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:05:23.630 --> 01:05:23.640 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note zero zero zero zero zero
 
01:05:25.250 --> 01:05:25.260 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question for the
 
01:05:26.870 --> 01:05:26.880 align:start position:0%
record crochet legislative budget
 
01:05:29.569 --> 01:05:29.579 align:start position:0%
assistant the deputy for the office
 
01:05:31.250 --> 01:05:31.260 align:start position:0%
um the total revenue being collected
 
01:05:33.890 --> 01:05:33.900 align:start position:0%
isn't changing as a result of this bill
 
01:05:35.870 --> 01:05:35.880 align:start position:0%
it's just where the revenue is being
 
01:05:38.089 --> 01:05:38.099 align:start position:0%
deposited so now it's going to all
 
01:05:40.490 --> 01:05:40.500 align:start position:0%
remain within the dedicated oplc fund
 
01:05:42.170 --> 01:05:42.180 align:start position:0%
and that's why in The Narrative we
 
01:05:44.510 --> 01:05:44.520 align:start position:0%
explain that the general fund wouldn't
 
01:05:46.670 --> 01:05:46.680 align:start position:0%
get a piece of the revenue that it was
 
01:05:49.130 --> 01:05:49.140 align:start position:0%
getting under the current law but the
 
01:05:51.109 --> 01:05:51.119 align:start position:0%
total revenue doesn't change
 
01:05:52.910 --> 01:05:52.920 align:start position:0%
so that's why it's zeroed at the Top If
 
01:05:54.230 --> 01:05:54.240 align:start position:0%
we put a negative number there it would
 
01:05:55.490 --> 01:05:55.500 align:start position:0%
look like there's
 
01:05:58.250 --> 01:05:58.260 align:start position:0%
Revenue being lost but we're trying to
 
01:05:59.690 --> 01:05:59.700 align:start position:0%
explain because of the table's
 
01:06:02.630 --> 01:06:02.640 align:start position:0%
limitations that it's General funds and
 
01:06:04.430 --> 01:06:04.440 align:start position:0%
other funds that are being impacted and
 
01:06:06.829 --> 01:06:06.839 align:start position:0%
then in the narrative we explain what
 
01:06:06.839 --> 01:06:08.210 align:start position:0%
then in the narrative we explain what
happens

01:06:08.210 --> 01:06:08.220 align:start position:0%
happens
 
01:06:10.010 --> 01:06:10.020 align:start position:0%
so so that that's the only reason it's
 
01:06:11.809 --> 01:06:11.819 align:start position:0%
it's a net zero
 
01:06:11.819 --> 01:06:13.609 align:start position:0%
it's a net zero
impact

01:06:13.609 --> 01:06:13.619 align:start position:0%
impact
 
01:06:15.829 --> 01:06:15.839 align:start position:0%
between for the revenue collected by the
 
01:06:15.839 --> 01:06:19.010 align:start position:0%
between for the revenue collected by the
state

01:06:19.010 --> 01:06:19.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:21.230 --> 01:06:21.240 align:start position:0%
uh you open to other questions
 
01:06:23.690 --> 01:06:23.700 align:start position:0%
and representative fellows oh
 
01:06:26.750 --> 01:06:26.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:28.309 --> 01:06:28.319 align:start position:0%
I apologize would you yield for
 
01:06:32.809 --> 01:06:32.819 align:start position:0%
representative thank you on on so if
 
01:06:35.990 --> 01:06:36.000 align:start position:0%
under this bill it's 8 million that
 
01:06:37.789 --> 01:06:37.799 align:start position:0%
should have lapsed
 
01:06:41.390 --> 01:06:41.400 align:start position:0%
two million will laps because there's a
 
01:06:43.430 --> 01:06:43.440 align:start position:0%
three million no the 3 million is the
 
01:06:47.390 --> 01:06:47.400 align:start position:0%
biennium so 5 million would flaps based
 
01:06:49.010 --> 01:06:49.020 align:start position:0%
on the language in the bill I believe
 
01:06:51.049 --> 01:06:51.059 align:start position:0%
none lapses back to the general fund at
 
01:06:52.910 --> 01:06:52.920 align:start position:0%
this point
 
01:06:54.609 --> 01:06:54.619 align:start position:0%
so they'd have to
 
01:06:57.650 --> 01:06:57.660 align:start position:0%
any there's limitations on what they can
 
01:06:59.150 --> 01:06:59.160 align:start position:0%
have in the fund and there's ways that
 
01:06:59.160 --> 01:07:00.190 align:start position:0%
have in the fund and there's ways that
the

01:07:00.190 --> 01:07:00.200 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:07:02.930 --> 01:07:02.940 align:start position:0%
oplc is expected to expend that Revenue
 
01:07:06.650 --> 01:07:06.660 align:start position:0%
so they'll they'll have to expend up to
 
01:07:08.990 --> 01:07:09.000 align:start position:0%
two to five million dollars in the next
 
01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:10.010 align:start position:0%
two to five million dollars in the next
year

01:07:10.010 --> 01:07:10.020 align:start position:0%
year
 
01:07:12.049 --> 01:07:12.059 align:start position:0%
or reduce licensing and certification
 
01:07:16.069 --> 01:07:16.079 align:start position:0%
fees right well that's part of expending
 
01:07:18.589 --> 01:07:18.599 align:start position:0%
on this doesn't seem to be terribly
 
01:07:20.690 --> 01:07:20.700 align:start position:0%
helpful when they're dealing with what's
 
01:07:23.569 --> 01:07:23.579 align:start position:0%
in the general fund
 
01:07:25.609 --> 01:07:25.619 align:start position:0%
all right the fiscal note does have some
 
01:07:28.250 --> 01:07:28.260 align:start position:0%
limitations when there's a net zero
 
01:07:32.089 --> 01:07:32.099 align:start position:0%
impact on a funding or an expense
 
01:07:33.589 --> 01:07:33.599 align:start position:0%
um and that's why the narrative aspect
 
01:07:34.730 --> 01:07:34.740 align:start position:0%
of it becomes a little bit more
 
01:07:34.740 --> 01:07:36.289 align:start position:0%
of it becomes a little bit more
important

01:07:36.289 --> 01:07:36.299 align:start position:0%
important
 
01:07:38.809 --> 01:07:38.819 align:start position:0%
yeah and something that a lot of people
 
01:07:40.849 --> 01:07:40.859 align:start position:0%
don't read
 
01:07:43.190 --> 01:07:43.200 align:start position:0%
uh I can't help that if they don't read
 
01:07:45.589 --> 01:07:45.599 align:start position:0%
them the narrative part it's there to
 
01:07:47.750 --> 01:07:47.760 align:start position:0%
help you
 
01:07:50.510 --> 01:07:50.520 align:start position:0%
representative Phyllis thank you I have
 
01:07:53.210 --> 01:07:53.220 align:start position:0%
a question about Capital expenditures
 
01:07:55.430 --> 01:07:55.440 align:start position:0%
because this bill talks about money
 
01:07:57.529 --> 01:07:57.539 align:start position:0%
being available to the agency for
 
01:07:59.930 --> 01:07:59.940 align:start position:0%
Capital expenditures after they pay for
 
01:08:03.589 --> 01:08:03.599 align:start position:0%
their operating expenditures so
 
01:08:06.349 --> 01:08:06.359 align:start position:0%
um what is the process for spending
 
01:08:09.049 --> 01:08:09.059 align:start position:0%
Capital expenditures don't do they what
 
01:08:11.809 --> 01:08:11.819 align:start position:0%
can you give us a definition of what it
 
01:08:15.170 --> 01:08:15.180 align:start position:0%
means when as in this bill and what is
 
01:08:17.470 --> 01:08:17.480 align:start position:0%
the process for
 
01:08:20.329 --> 01:08:20.339 align:start position:0%
approving an expenditure can it be done
 
01:08:22.309 --> 01:08:22.319 align:start position:0%
by the agency does it have to be
 
01:08:24.289 --> 01:08:24.299 align:start position:0%
budgeted does it have to go to the
 
01:08:27.829 --> 01:08:27.839 align:start position:0%
capital whatever the committee
 
01:08:31.010 --> 01:08:31.020 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question this fund is
 
01:08:33.229 --> 01:08:33.239 align:start position:0%
non-lapsing and continually appropriated
 
01:08:36.470 --> 01:08:36.480 align:start position:0%
to the open oplc
 
01:08:39.349 --> 01:08:39.359 align:start position:0%
um and within that language
 
01:08:41.329 --> 01:08:41.339 align:start position:0%
they're allowed to spend the money in
 
01:08:43.970 --> 01:08:43.980 align:start position:0%
certain ways and so the oplc would
 
01:08:46.070 --> 01:08:46.080 align:start position:0%
potentially be able to
 
01:08:47.870 --> 01:08:47.880 align:start position:0%
um spend the money on a capital Project
 
01:08:50.809 --> 01:08:50.819 align:start position:0%
without needing to come back through the
 
01:08:53.090 --> 01:08:53.100 align:start position:0%
capital budget process or come back to
 
01:08:56.050 --> 01:08:56.060 align:start position:0%
fiscal or Finance
 
01:08:59.150 --> 01:08:59.160 align:start position:0%
because the authority is given to them
 
01:09:02.329 --> 01:09:02.339 align:start position:0%
to spend from the fund
 
01:09:03.829 --> 01:09:03.839 align:start position:0%
for those members who have been around
 
01:09:06.530 --> 01:09:06.540 align:start position:0%
for a while you may may recall back um
 
01:09:10.490 --> 01:09:10.500 align:start position:0%
probably eight years ago when this
 
01:09:12.610 --> 01:09:12.620 align:start position:0%
dedicated fund was starting
 
01:09:15.229 --> 01:09:15.239 align:start position:0%
a previous director wanted to use some
 
01:09:16.849 --> 01:09:16.859 align:start position:0%
of the fun to pave the parking lot at
 
01:09:18.530 --> 01:09:18.540 align:start position:0%
their old site and there were some
 
01:09:20.150 --> 01:09:20.160 align:start position:0%
questions on whether that was allowable
 
01:09:22.070 --> 01:09:22.080 align:start position:0%
so I don't know if that's part of the
 
01:09:24.650 --> 01:09:24.660 align:start position:0%
reason for getting this capital
 
01:09:25.970 --> 01:09:25.980 align:start position:0%
expenditure I heard the director
 
01:09:28.010 --> 01:09:28.020 align:start position:0%
mentioned that they had computer
 
01:09:30.590 --> 01:09:30.600 align:start position:0%
projects that they would want to expend
 
01:09:33.590 --> 01:09:33.600 align:start position:0%
funds on and are expending funds on
 
01:09:35.870 --> 01:09:35.880 align:start position:0%
um but the way this is structured they
 
01:09:37.490 --> 01:09:37.500 align:start position:0%
would have that ability to do can you
 
01:09:40.130 --> 01:09:40.140 align:start position:0%
define the capital what it what
 
01:09:43.789 --> 01:09:43.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:45.829 --> 01:09:45.839 align:start position:0%
I think it's typically thought of as
 
01:09:48.410 --> 01:09:48.420 align:start position:0%
like the structures and more recently
 
01:09:50.749 --> 01:09:50.759 align:start position:0%
it's the you start to include your
 
01:09:53.209 --> 01:09:53.219 align:start position:0%
larger IT projects
 
01:09:55.070 --> 01:09:55.080 align:start position:0%
you know so if there's a new system
 
01:09:56.930 --> 01:09:56.940 align:start position:0%
being put in that's been considered a
 
01:09:56.940 --> 01:09:57.850 align:start position:0%
being put in that's been considered a
capital

01:09:57.850 --> 01:09:57.860 align:start position:0%
capital
 
01:10:00.770 --> 01:10:00.780 align:start position:0%
expense at least in the capital budget
 
01:10:04.010 --> 01:10:04.020 align:start position:0%
but I would defer to oplc to give you a
 
01:10:05.090 --> 01:10:05.100 align:start position:0%
better definition of what they
 
01:10:08.090 --> 01:10:08.100 align:start position:0%
anticipate the term Capital expenditures
 
01:10:12.890 --> 01:10:12.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:14.510 --> 01:10:14.520 align:start position:0%
representative Omi and then we'll go
 
01:10:18.050 --> 01:10:18.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:22.430 --> 01:10:22.440 align:start position:0%
uh would would they be allowed to if
 
01:10:24.950 --> 01:10:24.960 align:start position:0%
they could find or build another place
 
01:10:26.930 --> 01:10:26.940 align:start position:0%
to move into that is slightly less
 
01:10:28.970 --> 01:10:28.980 align:start position:0%
expensive than the one they're stuck in
 
01:10:32.090 --> 01:10:32.100 align:start position:0%
now for eight years to spend money to
 
01:10:34.610 --> 01:10:34.620 align:start position:0%
break the lease and to move
 
01:10:36.410 --> 01:10:36.420 align:start position:0%
without having to go through capital
 
01:10:36.420 --> 01:10:38.689 align:start position:0%
without having to go through capital
budget

01:10:38.689 --> 01:10:38.699 align:start position:0%
budget
 
01:10:41.990 --> 01:10:42.000 align:start position:0%
so purchasing buildings is a function of
 
01:10:43.850 --> 01:10:43.860 align:start position:0%
administrative services
 
01:10:45.530 --> 01:10:45.540 align:start position:0%
so I think that there would be other
 
01:10:48.669 --> 01:10:48.679 align:start position:0%
processes in place if the
 
01:10:52.490 --> 01:10:52.500 align:start position:0%
oplc were to want to move and break its
 
01:10:54.050 --> 01:10:54.060 align:start position:0%
lease and move into a new facility I
 
01:10:54.890 --> 01:10:54.900 align:start position:0%
think there would be some other
 
01:10:57.890 --> 01:10:57.900 align:start position:0%
oversights around that
 
01:10:57.900 --> 01:11:00.350 align:start position:0%
oversights around that
um

01:11:00.350 --> 01:11:00.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:02.090 --> 01:11:02.100 align:start position:0%
representative spilsbury
 
01:11:04.070 --> 01:11:04.080 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
01:11:04.080 --> 01:11:05.030 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
um

01:11:05.030 --> 01:11:05.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:11:09.350 --> 01:11:09.360 align:start position:0%
taking your point about it's a wash and
 
01:11:13.070 --> 01:11:13.080 align:start position:0%
the limitations of the fiscal note
 
01:11:15.470 --> 01:11:15.480 align:start position:0%
isn't it nevertheless pretty much the
 
01:11:17.630 --> 01:11:17.640 align:start position:0%
bottom line that if
 
01:11:20.209 --> 01:11:20.219 align:start position:0%
the fund could be generating as much as
 
01:11:22.550 --> 01:11:22.560 align:start position:0%
eight million dollars over the biennium
 
01:11:24.470 --> 01:11:24.480 align:start position:0%
and that no longer defaults to the
 
01:11:25.850 --> 01:11:25.860 align:start position:0%
general fund
 
01:11:28.790 --> 01:11:28.800 align:start position:0%
and they're required by this bill
 
01:11:32.689 --> 01:11:32.699 align:start position:0%
to adjust fees downwards as soon as they
 
01:11:34.390 --> 01:11:34.400 align:start position:0%
hit the three million dollar threshold
 
01:11:37.610 --> 01:11:37.620 align:start position:0%
the the end result
 
01:11:40.910 --> 01:11:40.920 align:start position:0%
is this drives a process that reduces
 
01:11:46.130 --> 01:11:46.140 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:48.950 --> 01:11:48.960 align:start position:0%
I think timing becomes an issue so if
 
01:11:50.270 --> 01:11:50.280 align:start position:0%
you look at our fiscal note it goes
 
01:11:52.850 --> 01:11:52.860 align:start position:0%
through 26 so depending on when this
 
01:11:54.830 --> 01:11:54.840 align:start position:0%
might occur it might be outside that
 
01:11:57.770 --> 01:11:57.780 align:start position:0%
period so I don't think we would
 
01:11:59.750 --> 01:11:59.760 align:start position:0%
speculate at this point
 
01:12:01.430 --> 01:12:01.440 align:start position:0%
how much extra Revenue they would or
 
01:12:04.090 --> 01:12:04.100 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have to drive down fees
 
01:12:07.550 --> 01:12:07.560 align:start position:0%
that's relatively new to this version of
 
01:12:10.370 --> 01:12:10.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:14.990 --> 01:12:15.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:16.610 --> 01:12:16.620 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:12:16.620 --> 01:12:17.270 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

01:12:17.270 --> 01:12:17.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:12:19.490 --> 01:12:19.500 align:start position:0%
I know we talked about the spell and I
 
01:12:20.930 --> 01:12:20.940 align:start position:0%
know I'm new so some of my questions
 
01:12:23.570 --> 01:12:23.580 align:start position:0%
might be repeats
 
01:12:23.580 --> 01:12:24.530 align:start position:0%
might be repeats
um

01:12:24.530 --> 01:12:24.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:12:27.490 --> 01:12:27.500 align:start position:0%
so to follow up on representative spill
 
01:12:30.290 --> 01:12:30.300 align:start position:0%
spillsbury's question
 
01:12:33.890 --> 01:12:33.900 align:start position:0%
um fiscal notes are only looking at
 
01:12:38.270 --> 01:12:38.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:40.010 --> 01:12:40.020 align:start position:0%
they look at the current year you're in
 
01:12:42.830 --> 01:12:42.840 align:start position:0%
and then three years out okay because it
 
01:12:44.450 --> 01:12:44.460 align:start position:0%
does seem like the way this is
 
01:12:47.570 --> 01:12:47.580 align:start position:0%
constructed like by design it reduces
 
01:12:50.090 --> 01:12:50.100 align:start position:0%
Revenue like that's part of the reason
 
01:12:51.890 --> 01:12:51.900 align:start position:0%
it's written so it does seem strange
 
01:12:55.310 --> 01:12:55.320 align:start position:0%
that that that idea cannot be captured
 
01:12:57.530 --> 01:12:57.540 align:start position:0%
in the fiscal note design that we
 
01:12:58.850 --> 01:12:58.860 align:start position:0%
currently have
 
01:13:02.450 --> 01:13:02.460 align:start position:0%
so that might be problematic
 
01:13:05.149 --> 01:13:05.159 align:start position:0%
thank you for the comment um we look at
 
01:13:07.010 --> 01:13:07.020 align:start position:0%
our fiscal note every year and try to
 
01:13:09.590 --> 01:13:09.600 align:start position:0%
come up with ways to address
 
01:13:13.250 --> 01:13:13.260 align:start position:0%
all different aspects that we run into
 
01:13:15.770 --> 01:13:15.780 align:start position:0%
um it's very difficult to make
 
01:13:17.750 --> 01:13:17.760 align:start position:0%
every situation
 
01:13:19.390 --> 01:13:19.400 align:start position:0%
fit this framework
 
01:13:21.830 --> 01:13:21.840 align:start position:0%
we try to standardize it so that it's
 
01:13:25.010 --> 01:13:25.020 align:start position:0%
known and understood so any potential
 
01:13:27.169 --> 01:13:27.179 align:start position:0%
comments you know we receive that and
 
01:13:28.850 --> 01:13:28.860 align:start position:0%
we'll try to come up with some solutions
 
01:13:30.830 --> 01:13:30.840 align:start position:0%
and it may take us a little bit but
 
01:13:33.410 --> 01:13:33.420 align:start position:0%
agreed I mean it would be
 
01:13:34.910 --> 01:13:34.920 align:start position:0%
it would be better to have a deeper
 
01:13:36.530 --> 01:13:36.540 align:start position:0%
analysis on this maybe than what's on
 
01:13:38.030 --> 01:13:38.040 align:start position:0%
there currently
 
01:13:39.890 --> 01:13:39.900 align:start position:0%
um but we do have some limitations on
 
01:13:42.229 --> 01:13:42.239 align:start position:0%
how we can get that done thank you it's
 
01:13:43.430 --> 01:13:43.440 align:start position:0%
great to learn that this is something
 
01:13:46.010 --> 01:13:46.020 align:start position:0%
that you do sometimes tweak when when
 
01:13:47.810 --> 01:13:47.820 align:start position:0%
you have new information so thanks for
 
01:13:50.450 --> 01:13:50.460 align:start position:0%
sharing that the other question I have
 
01:13:52.850 --> 01:13:52.860 align:start position:0%
and I know we've discussed thank you I
 
01:13:54.890 --> 01:13:54.900 align:start position:0%
know we discussed this bill
 
01:13:56.510 --> 01:13:56.520 align:start position:0%
um before
 
01:13:56.520 --> 01:13:58.189 align:start position:0%
um before
um

01:13:58.189 --> 01:13:58.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:14:01.490 --> 01:14:01.500 align:start position:0%
so I I'm sorry to to ask the question
 
01:14:05.090 --> 01:14:05.100 align:start position:0%
again but if we have an I.T department
 
01:14:08.930 --> 01:14:08.940 align:start position:0%
and if we have the you know the capital
 
01:14:12.410 --> 01:14:12.420 align:start position:0%
budget process I guess I'm wondering why
 
01:14:15.410 --> 01:14:15.420 align:start position:0%
a department needs its own capital
 
01:14:15.420 --> 01:14:17.810 align:start position:0%
a department needs its own capital
budget

01:14:17.810 --> 01:14:17.820 align:start position:0%
budget
 
01:14:19.910 --> 01:14:19.920 align:start position:0%
I would defer the question to the oplc
 
01:14:22.630 --> 01:14:22.640 align:start position:0%
okay so I guess I'm wondering if if
 
01:14:25.610 --> 01:14:25.620 align:start position:0%
department-wide it seems odd it's not
 
01:14:27.290 --> 01:14:27.300 align:start position:0%
every single department has its own
 
01:14:29.209 --> 01:14:29.219 align:start position:0%
capital budget and its own I.T budget
 
01:14:31.250 --> 01:14:31.260 align:start position:0%
normally those function through a
 
01:14:32.810 --> 01:14:32.820 align:start position:0%
different process so thank you for the
 
01:14:36.830 --> 01:14:36.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:39.290 --> 01:14:39.300 align:start position:0%
we all are learning every day that's why
 
01:14:40.510 --> 01:14:40.520 align:start position:0%
we keep coming back
 
01:14:42.890 --> 01:14:42.900 align:start position:0%
representative fellows so just to follow
 
01:14:46.370 --> 01:14:46.380 align:start position:0%
up on that can you tell us like are
 
01:14:49.010 --> 01:14:49.020 align:start position:0%
there other agencies who have this kind
 
01:14:52.689 --> 01:14:52.699 align:start position:0%
of structure where they have non-lapsing
 
01:14:56.390 --> 01:14:56.400 align:start position:0%
fund and they can buy a new building
 
01:14:59.570 --> 01:14:59.580 align:start position:0%
without getting any legislative approval
 
01:15:01.310 --> 01:15:01.320 align:start position:0%
of that
 
01:15:03.709 --> 01:15:03.719 align:start position:0%
I don't know of any agency that has a
 
01:15:05.630 --> 01:15:05.640 align:start position:0%
dedicated fund where they could buy a
 
01:15:05.640 --> 01:15:06.410 align:start position:0%
dedicated fund where they could buy a
building

01:15:06.410 --> 01:15:06.420 align:start position:0%
building
 
01:15:08.689 --> 01:15:08.699 align:start position:0%
agencies there are a number of dedicated
 
01:15:10.970 --> 01:15:10.980 align:start position:0%
funds that are continually appropriated
 
01:15:14.090 --> 01:15:14.100 align:start position:0%
and non-lapsing to an entity either be a
 
01:15:16.390 --> 01:15:16.400 align:start position:0%
department or a commission or a function
 
01:15:20.030 --> 01:15:20.040 align:start position:0%
and that those funds can be used based
 
01:15:21.709 --> 01:15:21.719 align:start position:0%
on what the statute says it can be used
 
01:15:23.990 --> 01:15:24.000 align:start position:0%
for so in this case the statutes
 
01:15:25.970 --> 01:15:25.980 align:start position:0%
including Capital expenditures there may
 
01:15:27.890 --> 01:15:27.900 align:start position:0%
be examples of that I'm not aware of it
 
01:15:32.950 --> 01:15:32.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:36.890 --> 01:15:36.900 align:start position:0%
representative only there was the
 
01:15:36.900 --> 01:15:39.110 align:start position:0%
representative only there was the
the

01:15:39.110 --> 01:15:39.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:41.990 --> 01:15:42.000 align:start position:0%
Department of Safety when they needed to
 
01:15:44.030 --> 01:15:44.040 align:start position:0%
replace the building that was falling
 
01:15:47.830 --> 01:15:47.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:51.590 --> 01:15:51.600 align:start position:0%
you're referencing the e911
 
01:15:51.600 --> 01:15:54.530 align:start position:0%
you're referencing the e911
yeah

01:15:54.530 --> 01:15:54.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:57.649 --> 01:15:57.659 align:start position:0%
this was back Beyond before that this
 
01:16:00.050 --> 01:16:00.060 align:start position:0%
was during the Great Recession
 
01:16:02.090 --> 01:16:02.100 align:start position:0%
I think it was the second building for
 
01:16:05.390 --> 01:16:05.400 align:start position:0%
the it was the backup building for e911
 
01:16:07.610 --> 01:16:07.620 align:start position:0%
um no
 
01:16:10.189 --> 01:16:10.199 align:start position:0%
oh Marine Patrol
 
01:16:11.990 --> 01:16:12.000 align:start position:0%
I'd have to see how that project came
 
01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:14.830 align:start position:0%
I'd have to see how that project came
about

01:16:14.830 --> 01:16:14.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:18.649 --> 01:16:18.659 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah falling in when we decided to
 
01:16:22.070 --> 01:16:22.080 align:start position:0%
keep the money in the dedicated fund
 
01:16:25.090 --> 01:16:25.100 align:start position:0%
okay other questions
 
01:16:27.290 --> 01:16:27.300 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you for coming up on
 
01:16:29.990 --> 01:16:30.000 align:start position:0%
this bill I do not just one little one
 
01:16:32.450 --> 01:16:32.460 align:start position:0%
one little tiny representative so just
 
01:16:36.290 --> 01:16:36.300 align:start position:0%
in terms of money not be being available
 
01:16:38.390 --> 01:16:38.400 align:start position:0%
at the beginning of the year to cover
 
01:16:43.130 --> 01:16:43.140 align:start position:0%
costs of an agency I my understanding is
 
01:16:45.470 --> 01:16:45.480 align:start position:0%
that if they have an appropriation it
 
01:16:47.630 --> 01:16:47.640 align:start position:0%
doesn't it's not important that they
 
01:16:49.310 --> 01:16:49.320 align:start position:0%
don't have any cash right at the
 
01:16:50.930 --> 01:16:50.940 align:start position:0%
beginning of the year is that true or
 
01:16:53.990 --> 01:16:54.000 align:start position:0%
does it apply to oplc
 
01:16:56.450 --> 01:16:56.460 align:start position:0%
so agencies that are funded with other
 
01:16:59.330 --> 01:16:59.340 align:start position:0%
funds are a dedicated fund because of
 
01:17:02.270 --> 01:17:02.280 align:start position:0%
cash flow they may go into a red or into
 
01:17:04.130 --> 01:17:04.140 align:start position:0%
a negative at the start of a fiscal year
 
01:17:05.630 --> 01:17:05.640 align:start position:0%
but it's anticipated based on
 
01:17:07.370 --> 01:17:07.380 align:start position:0%
projections that they're going to earn
 
01:17:10.090 --> 01:17:10.100 align:start position:0%
enough Revenue it'll get caught up that
 
01:17:11.870 --> 01:17:11.880 align:start position:0%
Comptroller's office and Bureau of
 
01:17:15.110 --> 01:17:15.120 align:start position:0%
accounts would track that and and as
 
01:17:17.870 --> 01:17:17.880 align:start position:0%
they earn Revenue repay back the general
 
01:17:20.930 --> 01:17:20.940 align:start position:0%
fund for paying any costs up front
 
01:17:24.470 --> 01:17:24.480 align:start position:0%
so so paying the covering the payroll is
 
01:17:26.990 --> 01:17:27.000 align:start position:0%
not a problem not does not be coming
 
01:17:31.010 --> 01:17:31.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:33.590 --> 01:17:33.600 align:start position:0%
thank you very much uh Senator Lang did
 
01:17:35.270 --> 01:17:35.280 align:start position:0%
you have one more thing to add okay
 
01:17:37.070 --> 01:17:37.080 align:start position:0%
great come on up and then we'll we'll
 
01:17:39.050 --> 01:17:39.060 align:start position:0%
close this unless if there's anyone else
 
01:17:41.270 --> 01:17:41.280 align:start position:0%
who's here for setup of 49 please fill
 
01:17:43.430 --> 01:17:43.440 align:start position:0%
out a pin card for us now
 
01:17:45.410 --> 01:17:45.420 align:start position:0%
the thing I want to remind the committee
 
01:17:46.729 --> 01:17:46.739 align:start position:0%
is that the commissioner doesn't have
 
01:17:48.229 --> 01:17:48.239 align:start position:0%
the authority to spend money on a
 
01:17:49.610 --> 01:17:49.620 align:start position:0%
capital expenditure without going in
 
01:17:52.130 --> 01:17:52.140 align:start position:0%
front of the governor and Council so any
 
01:17:54.110 --> 01:17:54.120 align:start position:0%
contract that was any above five
 
01:17:55.790 --> 01:17:55.800 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars that they would seek so
 
01:17:57.290 --> 01:17:57.300 align:start position:0%
the software upgrade which she was
 
01:17:58.970 --> 01:17:58.980 align:start position:0%
talking about that would be potentially
 
01:18:01.250 --> 01:18:01.260 align:start position:0%
a 3.7 million dollars there was three
 
01:18:02.689 --> 01:18:02.699 align:start position:0%
million dollars an account they just
 
01:18:05.810 --> 01:18:05.820 align:start position:0%
can't go do it without if seeking uh
 
01:18:08.209 --> 01:18:08.219 align:start position:0%
approval from another body so I just
 
01:18:09.350 --> 01:18:09.360 align:start position:0%
want to make sure it was clear that
 
01:18:11.270 --> 01:18:11.280 align:start position:0%
doesn't give her a three million dollar
 
01:18:14.090 --> 01:18:14.100 align:start position:0%
check to write whenever she wants that
 
01:18:15.890 --> 01:18:15.900 align:start position:0%
that contract would still have to go in
 
01:18:17.149 --> 01:18:17.159 align:start position:0%
front of the governor and Council for
 
01:18:18.770 --> 01:18:18.780 align:start position:0%
and go through that process through
 
01:18:21.290 --> 01:18:21.300 align:start position:0%
those elected officials
 
01:18:22.669 --> 01:18:22.679 align:start position:0%
one more question are you open to that
 
01:18:25.669 --> 01:18:25.679 align:start position:0%
representative just related to that
 
01:18:28.729 --> 01:18:28.739 align:start position:0%
um it goes to governor and Council after
 
01:18:32.030 --> 01:18:32.040 align:start position:0%
the agency has done an RFP and so the
 
01:18:34.189 --> 01:18:34.199 align:start position:0%
governor and council is saying you know
 
01:18:36.950 --> 01:18:36.960 align:start position:0%
is is this an above board contract or
 
01:18:39.229 --> 01:18:39.239 align:start position:0%
the you know um
 
01:18:41.209 --> 01:18:41.219 align:start position:0%
if they put it out to bid where the
 
01:18:43.970 --> 01:18:43.980 align:start position:0%
procedures fare and where they evaluated
 
01:18:46.250 --> 01:18:46.260 align:start position:0%
correctly and they
 
01:18:49.729 --> 01:18:49.739 align:start position:0%
you know dot all the eyes and cross all
 
01:18:52.970 --> 01:18:52.980 align:start position:0%
the t's in terms of contracts but isn't
 
01:18:56.270 --> 01:18:56.280 align:start position:0%
it correct that governor and Council
 
01:19:00.590 --> 01:19:00.600 align:start position:0%
doesn't decide that the agency gets to
 
01:19:03.050 --> 01:19:03.060 align:start position:0%
purchase something they just look at the
 
01:19:06.350 --> 01:19:06.360 align:start position:0%
contract to make sure the contract is
 
01:19:09.770 --> 01:19:09.780 align:start position:0%
good correct so I guess I say that's not
 
01:19:12.229 --> 01:19:12.239 align:start position:0%
true again the governor would bring it
 
01:19:13.970 --> 01:19:13.980 align:start position:0%
would have to be put on the agenda so
 
01:19:16.490 --> 01:19:16.500 align:start position:0%
the governor has to approve the say that
 
01:19:19.250 --> 01:19:19.260 align:start position:0%
they want this to go forward and and put
 
01:19:21.830 --> 01:19:21.840 align:start position:0%
it on the council agenda so in by tacit
 
01:19:23.330 --> 01:19:23.340 align:start position:0%
approval the governor would have to say
 
01:19:25.070 --> 01:19:25.080 align:start position:0%
that it's a worthwhile project and goes
 
01:19:27.470 --> 01:19:27.480 align:start position:0%
in front of the executive Council just
 
01:19:29.990 --> 01:19:30.000 align:start position:0%
because I go an agency goes gets an RFP
 
01:19:31.910 --> 01:19:31.920 align:start position:0%
for something that nobody wants to do
 
01:19:33.530 --> 01:19:33.540 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean it's forced to go in front
 
01:19:34.970 --> 01:19:34.980 align:start position:0%
of the executive Council so again
 
01:19:36.950 --> 01:19:36.960 align:start position:0%
there's tacit approval by the executive
 
01:19:39.110 --> 01:19:39.120 align:start position:0%
Council the governor that not only is
 
01:19:42.649 --> 01:19:42.659 align:start position:0%
the contract process fair and uh and was
 
01:19:44.570 --> 01:19:44.580 align:start position:0%
a prop appropriate but also is that the
 
01:19:49.790 --> 01:19:49.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:51.410 --> 01:19:51.420 align:start position:0%
you may want to bring the director up
 
01:19:52.910 --> 01:19:52.920 align:start position:0%
just to talk about that process a little
 
01:19:54.770 --> 01:19:54.780 align:start position:0%
bit and she would be much more familiar
 
01:19:56.090 --> 01:19:56.100 align:start position:0%
with that than myself and probably
 
01:19:59.750 --> 01:19:59.760 align:start position:0%
Senator Lang with the director will be
 
01:20:00.950 --> 01:20:00.960 align:start position:0%
able to talk about the governor and
 
01:20:02.770 --> 01:20:02.780 align:start position:0%
Council process
 
01:20:05.510 --> 01:20:05.520 align:start position:0%
executive Council
 
01:20:07.850 --> 01:20:07.860 align:start position:0%
she knows more about the executive
 
01:20:09.890 --> 01:20:09.900 align:start position:0%
Council yeah the executive agencies
 
01:20:11.510 --> 01:20:11.520 align:start position:0%
other tend to meet with the exact
 
01:20:13.790 --> 01:20:13.800 align:start position:0%
executive Council more frequently
 
01:20:16.970 --> 01:20:16.980 align:start position:0%
okay we well I don't I think there's a
 
01:20:18.229 --> 01:20:18.239 align:start position:0%
lot more questions that some members
 
01:20:20.209 --> 01:20:20.219 align:start position:0%
have and I certainly encourage you to go
 
01:20:22.669 --> 01:20:22.679 align:start position:0%
to the director or whoever you need to
 
01:20:25.189 --> 01:20:25.199 align:start position:0%
any board member the senator
 
01:20:27.229 --> 01:20:27.239 align:start position:0%
um you know do your own research on this
 
01:20:28.850 --> 01:20:28.860 align:start position:0%
take the time we're not going to execute
 
01:20:28.860 --> 01:20:30.229 align:start position:0%
take the time we're not going to execute
today

01:20:30.229 --> 01:20:30.239 align:start position:0%
today
 
01:20:32.570 --> 01:20:32.580 align:start position:0%
um and take your time on that because we
 
01:20:34.189 --> 01:20:34.199 align:start position:0%
do have some presentations coming up and
 
01:20:36.470 --> 01:20:36.480 align:start position:0%
I want to make sure we we don't eat into
 
01:20:39.890 --> 01:20:39.900 align:start position:0%
that time too much okay okay great thank
 
01:20:41.030 --> 01:20:41.040 align:start position:0%
you so much and with that we'll close
 
01:20:43.310 --> 01:20:43.320 align:start position:0%
the public hearing on Senate bill 49.
 
01:20:45.290 --> 01:20:45.300 align:start position:0%
and we will take a five minute recess
 
01:20:47.450 --> 01:20:47.460 align:start position:0%
and we will come back and we will listen
 
01:20:50.930 --> 01:20:50.940 align:start position:0%
to presentations on Revenue updates so
 
01:20:53.510 --> 01:20:53.520 align:start position:0%
again make sure you get uh the
 
01:20:55.430 --> 01:20:55.440 align:start position:0%
director's direct contact information if
 
01:20:57.590 --> 01:20:57.600 align:start position:0%
you have more detailed questions she can
 
01:27:32.570 --> 01:27:32.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:36.290 --> 01:27:36.300 align:start position:0%
okay let's get started so we don't go
 
01:27:43.850 --> 01:27:43.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:46.189 --> 01:27:46.199 align:start position:0%
so as I think we've all seen reported in
 
01:27:49.370 --> 01:27:49.380 align:start position:0%
the press the Senate found 184 million
 
01:27:52.070 --> 01:27:52.080 align:start position:0%
dollars more than we found in incoming
 
01:27:54.910 --> 01:27:54.920 align:start position:0%
revenue and so now we're very curious
 
01:27:58.310 --> 01:27:58.320 align:start position:0%
where that is
 
01:28:00.350 --> 01:28:00.360 align:start position:0%
um so we're very pleased to have the
 
01:28:02.390 --> 01:28:02.400 align:start position:0%
commission of the dra and Chris Shea
 
01:28:05.330 --> 01:28:05.340 align:start position:0%
back to give us an update good morning
 
01:28:08.090 --> 01:28:08.100 align:start position:0%
for the record crochet Deputy LBA
 
01:28:10.610 --> 01:28:10.620 align:start position:0%
um before you you have four documents
 
01:28:12.590 --> 01:28:12.600 align:start position:0%
you have the dra document that's
 
01:28:15.470 --> 01:28:15.480 align:start position:0%
probably familiar to most of you
 
01:28:19.010 --> 01:28:19.020 align:start position:0%
you have a single page long sheet
 
01:28:23.870 --> 01:28:23.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:26.689 --> 01:28:26.699 align:start position:0%
then you have a long page which is just
 
01:28:28.070 --> 01:28:28.080 align:start position:0%
the difference between the house and the
 
01:28:28.080 --> 01:28:28.970 align:start position:0%
the difference between the house and the
Senate

01:28:28.970 --> 01:28:28.980 align:start position:0%
Senate
 
01:28:31.430 --> 01:28:31.440 align:start position:0%
and then there's a compare sheet
 
01:28:33.790 --> 01:28:33.800 align:start position:0%
and then the last thing is a worksheet
 
01:28:36.290 --> 01:28:36.300 align:start position:0%
again it's familiar the house has used
 
01:28:38.689 --> 01:28:38.699 align:start position:0%
this type of format
 
01:28:40.250 --> 01:28:40.260 align:start position:0%
so those are the four documents you'll
 
01:28:41.750 --> 01:28:41.760 align:start position:0%
have before you the first document I
 
01:28:43.850 --> 01:28:43.860 align:start position:0%
want to start with is the one
 
01:28:48.050 --> 01:28:48.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:51.649 --> 01:28:51.659 align:start position:0%
and what this document is is the dra
 
01:28:53.750 --> 01:28:53.760 align:start position:0%
information the range of estimates that
 
01:28:55.790 --> 01:28:55.800 align:start position:0%
they provided to the house that's on the
 
01:28:57.649 --> 01:28:57.659 align:start position:0%
left side and then the range of
 
01:28:59.450 --> 01:28:59.460 align:start position:0%
estimates that they provided to the
 
01:29:01.790 --> 01:29:01.800 align:start position:0%
Senate which is on the right side
 
01:29:04.250 --> 01:29:04.260 align:start position:0%
and to the chair's comment that the
 
01:29:06.950 --> 01:29:06.960 align:start position:0%
Senate found about 184 million dollars
 
01:29:10.430 --> 01:29:10.440 align:start position:0%
more in Revenue the reason for that is
 
01:29:12.410 --> 01:29:12.420 align:start position:0%
in your business taxes your meals and
 
01:29:14.689 --> 01:29:14.699 align:start position:0%
rentals tax you're interested in
 
01:29:17.689 --> 01:29:17.699 align:start position:0%
dividends tax the base number
 
01:29:20.450 --> 01:29:20.460 align:start position:0%
that the senate had to use was higher
 
01:29:22.010 --> 01:29:22.020 align:start position:0%
than what the house had
 
01:29:24.410 --> 01:29:24.420 align:start position:0%
so that they started at a higher point
 
01:29:26.090 --> 01:29:26.100 align:start position:0%
than what the house did when they were
 
01:29:27.890 --> 01:29:27.900 align:start position:0%
doing their estimates
 
01:29:30.590 --> 01:29:30.600 align:start position:0%
and if you look at the Shaded
 
01:29:30.600 --> 01:29:32.030 align:start position:0%
and if you look at the Shaded
um

01:29:32.030 --> 01:29:32.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:29:34.790 --> 01:29:34.800 align:start position:0%
pieces you'll see that the ranges that
 
01:29:37.729 --> 01:29:37.739 align:start position:0%
the the department grew the bases are
 
01:29:39.410 --> 01:29:39.420 align:start position:0%
the same so for instance under the
 
01:29:41.510 --> 01:29:41.520 align:start position:0%
business taxes row five
 
01:29:44.270 --> 01:29:44.280 align:start position:0%
they grew the base from zero percent to
 
01:29:45.590 --> 01:29:45.600 align:start position:0%
two percent
 
01:29:48.050 --> 01:29:48.060 align:start position:0%
each year that was the same growth that
 
01:29:49.910 --> 01:29:49.920 align:start position:0%
they provided to the Senate and you'll
 
01:29:52.669 --> 01:29:52.679 align:start position:0%
see that throughout
 
01:29:54.470 --> 01:29:54.480 align:start position:0%
the one place that there are some
 
01:29:56.209 --> 01:29:56.219 align:start position:0%
adjustments would be in the tax law
 
01:29:58.970 --> 01:29:58.980 align:start position:0%
changes so because you have collected
 
01:30:01.790 --> 01:30:01.800 align:start position:0%
Revenue through April for the Senate
 
01:30:03.830 --> 01:30:03.840 align:start position:0%
side the department was able to make
 
01:30:06.050 --> 01:30:06.060 align:start position:0%
some adjustments to say that we've
 
01:30:08.570 --> 01:30:08.580 align:start position:0%
accounted for some of those decreases in
 
01:30:11.510 --> 01:30:11.520 align:start position:0%
Revenue so going forward for instance on
 
01:30:14.870 --> 01:30:14.880 align:start position:0%
line six instead of 19.6 in fiscal year
 
01:30:17.450 --> 01:30:17.460 align:start position:0%
2023 for your business tax for the tax
 
01:30:26.270 --> 01:30:26.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:28.129 --> 01:30:28.139 align:start position:0%
so I just I just again wanted to put
 
01:30:29.570 --> 01:30:29.580 align:start position:0%
this in front of you just so you could
 
01:30:32.510 --> 01:30:32.520 align:start position:0%
see what your ranges were for those
 
01:30:35.270 --> 01:30:35.280 align:start position:0%
taxes that the dra collects and then
 
01:30:38.450 --> 01:30:38.460 align:start position:0%
what the ranges were for the Senate
 
01:30:40.430 --> 01:30:40.440 align:start position:0%
um and again that's really how most of
 
01:30:42.649 --> 01:30:42.659 align:start position:0%
this growth occurred
 
01:30:44.629 --> 01:30:44.639 align:start position:0%
because could you just explain what what
 
01:30:46.669 --> 01:30:46.679 align:start position:0%
tax law change reduce the business
 
01:30:51.950 --> 01:30:51.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:55.090 --> 01:30:55.100 align:start position:0%
so you had um House Bill 2 from 2021
 
01:30:59.030 --> 01:30:59.040 align:start position:0%
House Bill 2 credit carryover from 2021.
 
01:31:00.470 --> 01:31:00.480 align:start position:0%
so these are all things over the three
 
01:31:02.510 --> 01:31:02.520 align:start position:0%
years that would have impacted um your
 
01:31:06.709 --> 01:31:06.719 align:start position:0%
your uh revenues again uh 2022 you had
 
01:31:10.129 --> 01:31:10.139 align:start position:0%
House Bill 1221 which was a rate change
 
01:31:12.590 --> 01:31:12.600 align:start position:0%
um and then the apportionment for the
 
01:31:16.070 --> 01:31:16.080 align:start position:0%
nol and Senate Bill 435 in 2022 were all
 
01:31:18.290 --> 01:31:18.300 align:start position:0%
related to the business taxes and for
 
01:31:20.870 --> 01:31:20.880 align:start position:0%
each of those dra made an adjustment and
 
01:31:22.430 --> 01:31:22.440 align:start position:0%
I'll let Lindsay to speak to that if
 
01:31:24.530 --> 01:31:24.540 align:start position:0%
you'd like good morning Lindsey stuff
 
01:31:25.910 --> 01:31:25.920 align:start position:0%
commissioner New Hampshire Department of
 
01:31:25.920 --> 01:31:26.830 align:start position:0%
commissioner New Hampshire Department of
Revenue

01:31:26.830 --> 01:31:26.840 align:start position:0%
Revenue
 
01:31:29.810 --> 01:31:29.820 align:start position:0%
the change
 
01:31:33.649 --> 01:31:33.659 align:start position:0%
that results from the 19.6 in fiscal
 
01:31:35.930 --> 01:31:35.940 align:start position:0%
year 23 that we gave you in the house
 
01:31:37.370 --> 01:31:37.380 align:start position:0%
when you're doing your business tax
 
01:31:41.090 --> 01:31:41.100 align:start position:0%
estimates compared to the 17.1 million
 
01:31:43.970 --> 01:31:43.980 align:start position:0%
that we gave to the Senate that is
 
01:31:47.510 --> 01:31:47.520 align:start position:0%
solely due to the hb2 credit carryover
 
01:31:50.629 --> 01:31:50.639 align:start position:0%
cap we started to see some refunds
 
01:31:53.209 --> 01:31:53.219 align:start position:0%
issued as a result of that cap in the
 
01:31:55.250 --> 01:31:55.260 align:start position:0%
time period between when we gave you
 
01:31:57.169 --> 01:31:57.179 align:start position:0%
your estimates and when we did the
 
01:31:59.629 --> 01:31:59.639 align:start position:0%
Senate estimates
 
01:32:05.810 --> 01:32:05.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:07.790 --> 01:32:07.800 align:start position:0%
so I I guess for the committee's
 
01:32:10.370 --> 01:32:10.380 align:start position:0%
purposes I I'd move you to the long
 
01:32:13.250 --> 01:32:13.260 align:start position:0%
sheet that's multiple pages long
 
01:32:15.530 --> 01:32:15.540 align:start position:0%
and just kind of walk you through each
 
01:32:17.270 --> 01:32:17.280 align:start position:0%
of the taxes on the front page each of
 
01:32:19.070 --> 01:32:19.080 align:start position:0%
the revenues on the front page and where
 
01:32:24.169 --> 01:32:24.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:27.410 --> 01:32:27.420 align:start position:0%
so the longsheet starts with the
 
01:32:29.930 --> 01:32:29.940 align:start position:0%
House and Senate ways and means general
 
01:32:32.689 --> 01:32:32.699 align:start position:0%
fund education trust fund estimates
 
01:32:35.870 --> 01:32:35.880 align:start position:0%
the left side of the sheet you have the
 
01:32:37.490 --> 01:32:37.500 align:start position:0%
plan number and then the house passed
 
01:32:37.500 --> 01:32:38.390 align:start position:0%
plan number and then the house passed
Revenue

01:32:38.390 --> 01:32:38.400 align:start position:0%
Revenue
 
01:32:39.830 --> 01:32:39.840 align:start position:0%
the middle of the sheet you see the
 
01:32:41.570 --> 01:32:41.580 align:start position:0%
Senate Ways and Means estimates and then
 
01:32:42.770 --> 01:32:42.780 align:start position:0%
the last three columns are the
 
01:32:44.390 --> 01:32:44.400 align:start position:0%
differences between the Senate Ways and
 
01:32:47.810 --> 01:32:47.820 align:start position:0%
Means estimates and the house estimates
 
01:32:50.209 --> 01:32:50.219 align:start position:0%
right away you can if you go across the
 
01:32:52.970 --> 01:32:52.980 align:start position:0%
bolded business taxes you can see that
 
01:32:55.850 --> 01:32:55.860 align:start position:0%
the Senate was 25 million dollars higher
 
01:32:58.490 --> 01:32:58.500 align:start position:0%
in fiscal 23 47 million dollars higher
 
01:33:01.129 --> 01:33:01.139 align:start position:0%
in 24 and 41 million dollars higher in
 
01:33:03.290 --> 01:33:03.300 align:start position:0%
25. this is the bulk of the increase
 
01:33:06.229 --> 01:33:06.239 align:start position:0%
that we were talking about and again it
 
01:33:09.110 --> 01:33:09.120 align:start position:0%
has to do with the senate had the
 
01:33:11.270 --> 01:33:11.280 align:start position:0%
advantage of having the April and March
 
01:33:15.770 --> 01:33:15.780 align:start position:0%
revenues collected dra was able to do
 
01:33:17.629 --> 01:33:17.639 align:start position:0%
some work related to that and came up
 
01:33:19.310 --> 01:33:19.320 align:start position:0%
with some new analyzes on what they
 
01:33:19.320 --> 01:33:20.110 align:start position:0%
with some new analyzes on what they
thought

01:33:20.110 --> 01:33:20.120 align:start position:0%
thought
 
01:33:22.729 --> 01:33:22.739 align:start position:0%
the revenues might be over the next
 
01:33:25.550 --> 01:33:25.560 align:start position:0%
couple of years which created a higher
 
01:33:27.110 --> 01:33:27.120 align:start position:0%
base to start from
 
01:33:29.030 --> 01:33:29.040 align:start position:0%
in terms of projections from that base
 
01:33:32.570 --> 01:33:32.580 align:start position:0%
the Senate was within the same areas or
 
01:33:35.330 --> 01:33:35.340 align:start position:0%
ranges as the house you know it wasn't
 
01:33:36.709 --> 01:33:36.719 align:start position:0%
like the Senate said okay we're going to
 
01:33:38.930 --> 01:33:38.940 align:start position:0%
grow it by 10 and in fact in some
 
01:33:41.450 --> 01:33:41.460 align:start position:0%
instances the Senate grew their Base
 
01:33:43.189 --> 01:33:43.199 align:start position:0%
number a little bit less than the
 
01:33:44.570 --> 01:33:44.580 align:start position:0%
percentage growth that the house used
 
01:33:48.290 --> 01:33:48.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:51.470 --> 01:33:51.480 align:start position:0%
similar thing for meals and rooms as you
 
01:33:53.090 --> 01:33:53.100 align:start position:0%
recall with meals and rooms it's on a
 
01:33:56.330 --> 01:33:56.340 align:start position:0%
gross number then you uh
 
01:33:58.189 --> 01:33:58.199 align:start position:0%
reduce it by the amount that's going to
 
01:33:59.510 --> 01:33:59.520 align:start position:0%
be transferred to the municipal Revenue
 
01:34:01.610 --> 01:34:01.620 align:start position:0%
fund and that gives you the net number
 
01:34:03.950 --> 01:34:03.960 align:start position:0%
that would go to the general fund it
 
01:34:05.390 --> 01:34:05.400 align:start position:0%
just happened that for the senate in
 
01:34:07.689 --> 01:34:07.699 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 23 and 24 the number is
 
01:34:10.430 --> 01:34:10.440 align:start position:0%
320.6 but their gross number was
 
01:34:12.290 --> 01:34:12.300 align:start position:0%
slightly higher in the second year but
 
01:34:14.209 --> 01:34:14.219 align:start position:0%
there was more removed for the municipal
 
01:34:19.430 --> 01:34:19.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:22.850 --> 01:34:22.860 align:start position:0%
tobacco and liquor there were no excuse
 
01:34:22.860 --> 01:34:24.229 align:start position:0%
tobacco and liquor there were no excuse
me

01:34:24.229 --> 01:34:24.239 align:start position:0%
me
 
01:34:26.270 --> 01:34:26.280 align:start position:0%
tobacco there was a slight change in 25
 
01:34:29.270 --> 01:34:29.280 align:start position:0%
the the Senate was just under a million
 
01:34:31.570 --> 01:34:31.580 align:start position:0%
dollars higher there were some
 
01:34:35.030 --> 01:34:35.040 align:start position:0%
discussion that the some members didn't
 
01:34:37.370 --> 01:34:37.380 align:start position:0%
believe that it would reduce as steeply
 
01:34:39.770 --> 01:34:39.780 align:start position:0%
as the house had reduced it but again it
 
01:34:41.390 --> 01:34:41.400 align:start position:0%
was within less than a million dollars
 
01:34:43.490 --> 01:34:43.500 align:start position:0%
but other than that fiscal 23 and 24
 
01:34:45.110 --> 01:34:45.120 align:start position:0%
were the same
 
01:34:47.330 --> 01:34:47.340 align:start position:0%
liquor there was no change from what the
 
01:34:50.090 --> 01:34:50.100 align:start position:0%
agency provided to the senate or the
 
01:34:50.100 --> 01:34:51.350 align:start position:0%
agency provided to the senate or the
house

01:34:51.350 --> 01:34:51.360 align:start position:0%
house
 
01:34:53.810 --> 01:34:53.820 align:start position:0%
the IND is a 10 million dollar increase
 
01:34:55.430 --> 01:34:55.440 align:start position:0%
in all three years again that has to do
 
01:34:57.950 --> 01:34:57.960 align:start position:0%
with the base and if you look at the
 
01:35:00.229 --> 01:35:00.239 align:start position:0%
long sheet the Senate essentially took
 
01:35:04.790 --> 01:35:04.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:08.209 --> 01:35:08.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:10.850 --> 01:35:10.860 align:start position:0%
so they went with the low end of the
 
01:35:13.430 --> 01:35:13.440 align:start position:0%
range that this uh they had on their
 
01:35:13.440 --> 01:35:15.229 align:start position:0%
range that this uh they had on their
sheet

01:35:15.229 --> 01:35:15.239 align:start position:0%
sheet
 
01:35:17.270 --> 01:35:17.280 align:start position:0%
so it was 145 million that's what they
 
01:35:18.770 --> 01:35:18.780 align:start position:0%
stuck with and then they just grew up by
 
01:35:20.689 --> 01:35:20.699 align:start position:0%
the 10 million or reduced it by 10
 
01:35:20.699 --> 01:35:21.890 align:start position:0%
the 10 million or reduced it by 10
million

01:35:21.890 --> 01:35:21.900 align:start position:0%
million
 
01:35:23.750 --> 01:35:23.760 align:start position:0%
so it was exactly 10 million higher than
 
01:35:27.590 --> 01:35:27.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:29.810 --> 01:35:29.820 align:start position:0%
insurance tax
 
01:35:32.270 --> 01:35:32.280 align:start position:0%
so premiums were collected in April
 
01:35:33.649 --> 01:35:33.659 align:start position:0%
actually be in March and then
 
01:35:36.350 --> 01:35:36.360 align:start position:0%
adjustments are made in April after all
 
01:35:38.390 --> 01:35:38.400 align:start position:0%
that had been done the department came
 
01:35:40.129 --> 01:35:40.139 align:start position:0%
in and said they were 15.3 million
 
01:35:41.149 --> 01:35:41.159 align:start position:0%
dollars higher than what they
 
01:35:41.159 --> 01:35:42.830 align:start position:0%
dollars higher than what they
anticipated

01:35:42.830 --> 01:35:42.840 align:start position:0%
anticipated
 
01:35:44.390 --> 01:35:44.400 align:start position:0%
um when they were before the house so
 
01:35:47.030 --> 01:35:47.040 align:start position:0%
you'll see in 23 you see that adjustment
 
01:35:47.040 --> 01:35:48.350 align:start position:0%
you'll see in 23 you see that adjustment
up

01:35:48.350 --> 01:35:48.360 align:start position:0%
up
 
01:35:52.010 --> 01:35:52.020 align:start position:0%
for 24 and 25 the reason that there's a
 
01:35:53.689 --> 01:35:53.699 align:start position:0%
slight difference is that the Senate
 
01:35:56.270 --> 01:35:56.280 align:start position:0%
questioned the commissioner of a
 
01:35:58.370 --> 01:35:58.380 align:start position:0%
department of insurance and and said you
 
01:35:59.390 --> 01:35:59.400 align:start position:0%
were pretty conservative with your
 
01:36:01.550 --> 01:36:01.560 align:start position:0%
numbers why couldn't we go up slightly
 
01:36:05.330 --> 01:36:05.340 align:start position:0%
in 24 and 25 and there was an agreement
 
01:36:06.890 --> 01:36:06.900 align:start position:0%
to go up by the million dollars each
 
01:36:06.900 --> 01:36:08.689 align:start position:0%
to go up by the million dollars each
year

01:36:08.689 --> 01:36:08.699 align:start position:0%
year
 
01:36:12.410 --> 01:36:12.420 align:start position:0%
the agency felt that was reasonable
 
01:36:15.590 --> 01:36:15.600 align:start position:0%
communication Services tax
 
01:36:17.990 --> 01:36:18.000 align:start position:0%
again the base changed slightly so
 
01:36:20.510 --> 01:36:20.520 align:start position:0%
you'll see some of the growth that the
 
01:36:20.520 --> 01:36:21.410 align:start position:0%
you'll see some of the growth that the
um

01:36:21.410 --> 01:36:21.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:36:24.590 --> 01:36:24.600 align:start position:0%
the senate had over the house
 
01:36:27.169 --> 01:36:27.179 align:start position:0%
they did hold it flat almost flat all
 
01:36:29.510 --> 01:36:29.520 align:start position:0%
three years it was 30.3 and 23 and then
 
01:36:33.290 --> 01:36:33.300 align:start position:0%
30 million and 30 million and 24.25
 
01:36:35.090 --> 01:36:35.100 align:start position:0%
. if you need to jump in at any point
 
01:36:37.610 --> 01:36:37.620 align:start position:0%
feel free okay
 
01:36:37.620 --> 01:36:41.570 align:start position:0%
feel free okay
really

01:36:41.570 --> 01:36:41.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:43.910 --> 01:36:43.920 align:start position:0%
so I asked the question now when we're
 
01:36:45.530 --> 01:36:45.540 align:start position:0%
done oh sure would you be open to a
 
01:36:46.610 --> 01:36:46.620 align:start position:0%
question now yeah should representative
 
01:36:49.729 --> 01:36:49.739 align:start position:0%
Schaumburg on on the insurance
 
01:36:53.270 --> 01:36:53.280 align:start position:0%
that the Senate said they just requested
 
01:36:55.370 --> 01:36:55.380 align:start position:0%
was that backed up by any economic
 
01:36:58.250 --> 01:36:58.260 align:start position:0%
factors by the insurance department so
 
01:37:00.050 --> 01:37:00.060 align:start position:0%
so the insurance department you know
 
01:37:02.090 --> 01:37:02.100 align:start position:0%
testified that they tend to use a
 
01:37:03.590 --> 01:37:03.600 align:start position:0%
conservative approach to estimating
 
01:37:04.850 --> 01:37:04.860 align:start position:0%
their revenues
 
01:37:06.830 --> 01:37:06.840 align:start position:0%
so they were questioned as to why
 
01:37:08.030 --> 01:37:08.040 align:start position:0%
couldn't it be a little bit higher if
 
01:37:09.470 --> 01:37:09.480 align:start position:0%
you're being conservative why not be a
 
01:37:10.669 --> 01:37:10.679 align:start position:0%
little bit higher
 
01:37:13.010 --> 01:37:13.020 align:start position:0%
and and they agreed that it could be
 
01:37:19.430 --> 01:37:19.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:19.440 --> 01:37:20.570 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:37:20.570 --> 01:37:20.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:37:22.129 --> 01:37:22.139 align:start position:0%
so for moving down to the real estate
 
01:37:24.709 --> 01:37:24.719 align:start position:0%
transfer you'll see it's a decrease from
 
01:37:26.689 --> 01:37:26.699 align:start position:0%
the house position again the base was
 
01:37:28.910 --> 01:37:28.920 align:start position:0%
lower for the real estate transfer and
 
01:37:33.649 --> 01:37:33.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:36.410 --> 01:37:36.420 align:start position:0%
yes representative Southworth
 
01:37:39.590 --> 01:37:39.600 align:start position:0%
Stratford County our Register of Deeds
 
01:37:42.229 --> 01:37:42.239 align:start position:0%
has warned us that really was a rough
 
01:37:44.629 --> 01:37:44.639 align:start position:0%
period fortunately we found some ways to
 
01:37:46.250 --> 01:37:46.260 align:start position:0%
make up the funds but there was a pretty
 
01:37:49.550 --> 01:37:49.560 align:start position:0%
large hit just for our County
 
01:37:51.229 --> 01:37:51.239 align:start position:0%
you're talking on real estate transfer
 
01:37:53.570 --> 01:37:53.580 align:start position:0%
taxes yes okay thank you
 
01:37:57.709 --> 01:37:57.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:59.629 --> 01:37:59.639 align:start position:0%
and you'll see the senate had a you know
 
01:38:01.790 --> 01:38:01.800 align:start position:0%
13.5 million dollars less than the house
 
01:38:05.229 --> 01:38:05.239 align:start position:0%
and then five and five and 24.25
 
01:38:07.490 --> 01:38:07.500 align:start position:0%
reflecting some of what they heard in
 
01:38:12.290 --> 01:38:12.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:14.330 --> 01:38:14.340 align:start position:0%
court fines and fees you'll see a slight
 
01:38:16.250 --> 01:38:16.260 align:start position:0%
adjustment down the agency
 
01:38:18.110 --> 01:38:18.120 align:start position:0%
um many of you know Donna Raymond from
 
01:38:20.810 --> 01:38:20.820 align:start position:0%
the courts she re-looked at her figures
 
01:38:22.430 --> 01:38:22.440 align:start position:0%
and and came in slightly less than what
 
01:38:24.110 --> 01:38:24.120 align:start position:0%
she had presented to the house
 
01:38:26.750 --> 01:38:26.760 align:start position:0%
so you'll see it's a 200 000 adjustment
 
01:38:31.669 --> 01:38:31.679 align:start position:0%
down in 23 500 024 and five eight
 
01:38:33.709 --> 01:38:33.719 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand and twenty five and
 
01:38:35.149 --> 01:38:35.159 align:start position:0%
much of that has to do with some of the
 
01:38:38.689 --> 01:38:38.699 align:start position:0%
The Plea by mail related revenue and I
 
01:38:40.370 --> 01:38:40.380 align:start position:0%
think she testified to that before you
 
01:38:42.649 --> 01:38:42.659 align:start position:0%
that it's really hard to project how
 
01:38:44.330 --> 01:38:44.340 align:start position:0%
where that's going to land because
 
01:38:47.510 --> 01:38:47.520 align:start position:0%
there's been changes on how who collects
 
01:38:49.970 --> 01:38:49.980 align:start position:0%
that but also with covid and what the
 
01:38:52.129 --> 01:38:52.139 align:start position:0%
courts were doing some of the flow of
 
01:38:53.990 --> 01:38:54.000 align:start position:0%
that Revenue
 
01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:56.270 align:start position:0%
that Revenue
um

01:38:56.270 --> 01:38:56.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:58.129 --> 01:38:58.139 align:start position:0%
uh Securities Revenue there was no
 
01:38:59.390 --> 01:38:59.400 align:start position:0%
difference between the house and the
 
01:39:01.250 --> 01:39:01.260 align:start position:0%
senate had
 
01:39:04.790 --> 01:39:04.800 align:start position:0%
no difference in the beer tax
 
01:39:07.010 --> 01:39:07.020 align:start position:0%
the other Revenue you'll see a slight
 
01:39:10.850 --> 01:39:10.860 align:start position:0%
adjustment upward in 23 so now that they
 
01:39:12.649 --> 01:39:12.659 align:start position:0%
um again are through the month of April
 
01:39:14.870 --> 01:39:14.880 align:start position:0%
the department
 
01:39:17.209 --> 01:39:17.219 align:start position:0%
um controller and then the treasurer had
 
01:39:18.590 --> 01:39:18.600 align:start position:0%
a better sense of where we were going to
 
01:39:19.970 --> 01:39:19.980 align:start position:0%
land with some of those other revenues
 
01:39:22.490 --> 01:39:22.500 align:start position:0%
including interest revenue and the
 
01:39:24.770 --> 01:39:24.780 align:start position:0%
abandoned property Revenue so they were
 
01:39:27.590 --> 01:39:27.600 align:start position:0%
up by 2.3 over the house but slightly
 
01:39:31.189 --> 01:39:31.199 align:start position:0%
down in um 24 and 25 100 000 each year
 
01:39:33.110 --> 01:39:33.120 align:start position:0%
again it's just based on their
 
01:39:36.649 --> 01:39:36.659 align:start position:0%
forecasting of some of those revenues
 
01:39:38.810 --> 01:39:38.820 align:start position:0%
the lottery Revenue
 
01:39:42.129 --> 01:39:42.139 align:start position:0%
you're going to see it was up in 23
 
01:39:45.530 --> 01:39:45.540 align:start position:0%
the house had 170 million point eight
 
01:39:49.550 --> 01:39:49.560 align:start position:0%
the commission came in at 180 million
 
01:39:53.270 --> 01:39:53.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:55.550 --> 01:39:55.560 align:start position:0%
similar to Insurance
 
01:39:58.910 --> 01:39:58.920 align:start position:0%
um the the director of uh the Lottery
 
01:40:00.590 --> 01:40:00.600 align:start position:0%
Commission indicated that they budget
 
01:40:03.050 --> 01:40:03.060 align:start position:0%
their revenue pretty conservatively
 
01:40:04.729 --> 01:40:04.739 align:start position:0%
so the committee challenged them to
 
01:40:07.850 --> 01:40:07.860 align:start position:0%
maybe increase it slightly and the
 
01:40:10.430 --> 01:40:10.440 align:start position:0%
commission agreed with the CFO
 
01:40:13.669 --> 01:40:13.679 align:start position:0%
uh after looking at you know some of his
 
01:40:15.890 --> 01:40:15.900 align:start position:0%
projections agreed it could go up by 2
 
01:40:23.270 --> 01:40:23.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:25.910 --> 01:40:25.920 align:start position:0%
representative Southworth thank you
 
01:40:27.590 --> 01:40:27.600 align:start position:0%
um in talking with the lottery the
 
01:40:29.629 --> 01:40:29.639 align:start position:0%
different forms of gambling we've been
 
01:40:31.370 --> 01:40:31.380 align:start position:0%
hearing room for growth in our
 
01:40:33.890 --> 01:40:33.900 align:start position:0%
conversations but it doesn't look like
 
01:40:36.290 --> 01:40:36.300 align:start position:0%
the budget really showed room for growth
 
01:40:40.010 --> 01:40:40.020 align:start position:0%
is that just uh an unknown
 
01:40:43.490 --> 01:40:43.500 align:start position:0%
so if you recall when the director for
 
01:40:45.410 --> 01:40:45.420 align:start position:0%
the Lottery Commission spoke with you he
 
01:40:47.149 --> 01:40:47.159 align:start position:0%
talks about a lot of unknowns with the
 
01:40:50.090 --> 01:40:50.100 align:start position:0%
revenues Associated you need a couple of
 
01:40:54.790 --> 01:40:54.800 align:start position:0%
big Powerball type games and that the
 
01:40:58.729 --> 01:40:58.739 align:start position:0%
billion dollar lottery or prize is is
 
01:41:00.530 --> 01:41:00.540 align:start position:0%
becoming old people want to see
 
01:41:02.330 --> 01:41:02.340 align:start position:0%
something higher so the revenue
 
01:41:04.610 --> 01:41:04.620 align:start position:0%
generation is is slowing down slightly
 
01:41:06.649 --> 01:41:06.659 align:start position:0%
in addition you know you've got other
 
01:41:09.110 --> 01:41:09.120 align:start position:0%
games that are opening up and and he
 
01:41:11.810 --> 01:41:11.820 align:start position:0%
still hadn't fully realized the benefits
 
01:41:14.390 --> 01:41:14.400 align:start position:0%
or the impacts of on each other so he
 
01:41:15.770 --> 01:41:15.780 align:start position:0%
hadn't talked about a conservative
 
01:41:17.330 --> 01:41:17.340 align:start position:0%
approach to his revenues in the out
 
01:41:17.340 --> 01:41:18.709 align:start position:0%
approach to his revenues in the out
years

01:41:18.709 --> 01:41:18.719 align:start position:0%
years
 
01:41:21.470 --> 01:41:21.480 align:start position:0%
um I I think the Senate pushed him a
 
01:41:23.510 --> 01:41:23.520 align:start position:0%
little bit more than the house did on
 
01:41:25.310 --> 01:41:25.320 align:start position:0%
that aspect of being conservative in the
 
01:41:28.729 --> 01:41:28.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:28.739 --> 01:41:36.129 align:start position:0%
 
representatively

01:41:36.129 --> 01:41:36.139 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:38.629 --> 01:41:38.639 align:start position:0%
I turned it off instead of on I
 
01:41:40.910 --> 01:41:40.920 align:start position:0%
apologize sorry
 
01:41:40.920 --> 01:41:42.410 align:start position:0%
apologize sorry
um

01:41:42.410 --> 01:41:42.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:41:44.689 --> 01:41:44.699 align:start position:0%
so just to restate to make sure I
 
01:41:46.250 --> 01:41:46.260 align:start position:0%
understand this correctly it sounds like
 
01:41:49.970 --> 01:41:49.980 align:start position:0%
the Senate based on the first quarter
 
01:41:53.570 --> 01:41:53.580 align:start position:0%
revenues of this year
 
01:41:58.030 --> 01:41:58.040 align:start position:0%
um for FY 2023 pushed up their estimates
 
01:42:01.490 --> 01:42:01.500 align:start position:0%
is that correct so you have nine months
 
01:42:04.070 --> 01:42:04.080 align:start position:0%
of Revenue collected through April and
 
01:42:06.350 --> 01:42:06.360 align:start position:0%
based on what you've collected
 
01:42:08.570 --> 01:42:08.580 align:start position:0%
right so it's not just the first quarter
 
01:42:10.370 --> 01:42:10.380 align:start position:0%
it's actually nine months it's nine
 
01:42:12.830 --> 01:42:12.840 align:start position:0%
months so you have a good sign some of
 
01:42:14.629 --> 01:42:14.639 align:start position:0%
your Revenue collections you see most of
 
01:42:17.330 --> 01:42:17.340 align:start position:0%
that occur in April like your IND
 
01:42:20.450 --> 01:42:20.460 align:start position:0%
So based on some of these estimates that
 
01:42:22.550 --> 01:42:22.560 align:start position:0%
came in the senate had a better position
 
01:42:24.709 --> 01:42:24.719 align:start position:0%
in terms of their projections than this
 
01:42:26.870 --> 01:42:26.880 align:start position:0%
the house did if you recall the house
 
01:42:29.270 --> 01:42:29.280 align:start position:0%
you didn't really have March estimates
 
01:42:32.330 --> 01:42:32.340 align:start position:0%
or April estimates right so they're um
 
01:42:32.340 --> 01:42:33.729 align:start position:0%
or April estimates right so they're um
estimating

01:42:33.729 --> 01:42:33.739 align:start position:0%
estimating
 
01:42:36.830 --> 01:42:36.840 align:start position:0%
2023 really with only three months left
 
01:42:41.109 --> 01:42:41.119 align:start position:0%
right okay and then 2024 2025 numbers
 
01:42:44.830 --> 01:42:44.840 align:start position:0%
look lower because like us
 
01:42:47.570 --> 01:42:47.580 align:start position:0%
they're expecting the economy to slow
 
01:42:50.209 --> 01:42:50.219 align:start position:0%
down a little bit from 23.
 
01:42:53.209 --> 01:42:53.219 align:start position:0%
yes okay yes thank you representative
 
01:42:55.310 --> 01:42:55.320 align:start position:0%
plan yes thank you thank you for taking
 
01:42:58.729 --> 01:42:58.739 align:start position:0%
my question when did the senate pass its
 
01:43:01.070 --> 01:43:01.080 align:start position:0%
Revenue estimate how long ago
 
01:43:04.609 --> 01:43:04.619 align:start position:0%
last Wednesday okay so there's no
 
01:43:08.570 --> 01:43:08.580 align:start position:0%
updates from dra to have us further
 
01:43:11.390 --> 01:43:11.400 align:start position:0%
tweak and thank you no d8 but dra is
 
01:43:13.370 --> 01:43:13.380 align:start position:0%
here to if there was questions that were
 
01:43:17.390 --> 01:43:17.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:19.250 --> 01:43:19.260 align:start position:0%
yeah and again we're always the house is
 
01:43:20.689 --> 01:43:20.699 align:start position:0%
always a little bit of a disadvantage
 
01:43:22.669 --> 01:43:22.679 align:start position:0%
because the two major Revenue months are
 
01:43:24.470 --> 01:43:24.480 align:start position:0%
March and April and we didn't have that
 
01:43:27.470 --> 01:43:27.480 align:start position:0%
information so thank you uh
 
01:43:31.030 --> 01:43:31.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:33.470 --> 01:43:33.480 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you
 
01:43:36.830 --> 01:43:36.840 align:start position:0%
um for being here and helping us out
 
01:43:36.840 --> 01:43:38.570 align:start position:0%
um for being here and helping us out
um

01:43:38.570 --> 01:43:38.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:43:41.149 --> 01:43:41.159 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at the business tax
 
01:43:45.709 --> 01:43:45.719 align:start position:0%
uh and the net revenue and the amounts
 
01:43:47.770 --> 01:43:47.780 align:start position:0%
projected by
 
01:43:53.209 --> 01:43:53.219 align:start position:0%
uh by the Senate ways and Mains and um
 
01:43:55.609 --> 01:43:55.619 align:start position:0%
essentially they're sort of halfway
 
01:43:58.850 --> 01:43:58.860 align:start position:0%
between your high and low as I get it I
 
01:44:01.010 --> 01:44:01.020 align:start position:0%
mean that's rough but something like
 
01:44:01.020 --> 01:44:02.350 align:start position:0%
mean that's rough but something like
that

01:44:02.350 --> 01:44:02.360 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:44:07.430 --> 01:44:07.440 align:start position:0%
my question is to to you for to dra and
 
01:44:07.440 --> 01:44:08.450 align:start position:0%
my question is to to you for to dra and
uh

01:44:08.450 --> 01:44:08.460 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:44:11.930 --> 01:44:11.940 align:start position:0%
uh whether since you met with us because
 
01:44:13.490 --> 01:44:13.500 align:start position:0%
these are still the same it's the same
 
01:44:13.500 --> 01:44:14.830 align:start position:0%
these are still the same it's the same
spread

01:44:14.830 --> 01:44:14.840 align:start position:0%
spread
 
01:44:18.290 --> 01:44:18.300 align:start position:0%
factors that you used before whether
 
01:44:20.990 --> 01:44:21.000 align:start position:0%
you've uh a lot has happened in the
 
01:44:23.450 --> 01:44:23.460 align:start position:0%
economy in the last two months or it
 
01:44:25.070 --> 01:44:25.080 align:start position:0%
appears to have happened or you know
 
01:44:26.990 --> 01:44:27.000 align:start position:0%
we're all looking at it and wondering
 
01:44:28.310 --> 01:44:28.320 align:start position:0%
what's going on
 
01:44:34.129 --> 01:44:34.139 align:start position:0%
and um predictions are as usual you know
 
01:44:36.470 --> 01:44:36.480 align:start position:0%
impossible to make but we make them
 
01:44:38.830 --> 01:44:38.840 align:start position:0%
nonetheless and um
 
01:44:42.830 --> 01:44:42.840 align:start position:0%
and so you're still you're hanging in
 
01:44:46.070 --> 01:44:46.080 align:start position:0%
there with zero percent and two percent
 
01:44:54.950 --> 01:44:54.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:56.390 --> 01:44:56.400 align:start position:0%
all right
 
01:44:59.270 --> 01:44:59.280 align:start position:0%
I just fiddle with my hands and it
 
01:45:01.550 --> 01:45:01.560 align:start position:0%
yeah sure the factors that go into the
 
01:45:05.090 --> 01:45:05.100 align:start position:0%
zero to two percent range
 
01:45:06.709 --> 01:45:06.719 align:start position:0%
um so
 
01:45:08.689 --> 01:45:08.699 align:start position:0%
I will counter your statement of a lot
 
01:45:10.850 --> 01:45:10.860 align:start position:0%
has happened in the economy in the last
 
01:45:13.250 --> 01:45:13.260 align:start position:0%
few months to a lot of conversations
 
01:45:15.530 --> 01:45:15.540 align:start position:0%
about the economy have happened in the
 
01:45:18.830 --> 01:45:18.840 align:start position:0%
last few months although looking at
 
01:45:21.470 --> 01:45:21.480 align:start position:0%
our business tax revenues
 
01:45:24.229 --> 01:45:24.239 align:start position:0%
we're not seeing a lot of changes
 
01:45:28.669 --> 01:45:28.679 align:start position:0%
necessarily in the economy estimates for
 
01:45:34.370 --> 01:45:34.380 align:start position:0%
April were 23 ahead of the prior April
 
01:45:38.450 --> 01:45:38.460 align:start position:0%
um returns and extensions performed well
 
01:45:40.850 --> 01:45:40.860 align:start position:0%
up about five percent from the prior
 
01:45:40.860 --> 01:45:43.129 align:start position:0%
up about five percent from the prior
year

01:45:43.129 --> 01:45:43.139 align:start position:0%
year
 
01:45:45.350 --> 01:45:45.360 align:start position:0%
um and our tax notice revenue is still
 
01:45:48.830 --> 01:45:48.840 align:start position:0%
strong so I think those factors are kind
 
01:45:51.530 --> 01:45:51.540 align:start position:0%
of leading us to that two percent where
 
01:45:54.590 --> 01:45:54.600 align:start position:0%
we're still seeing strong revenues
 
01:45:57.410 --> 01:45:57.420 align:start position:0%
in the business taxes but it is those
 
01:45:59.450 --> 01:45:59.460 align:start position:0%
conversations about the economy I think
 
01:46:03.770 --> 01:46:03.780 align:start position:0%
that are causing us to lower that growth
 
01:46:06.350 --> 01:46:06.360 align:start position:0%
to that essentially stagnant growth at
 
01:46:07.910 --> 01:46:07.920 align:start position:0%
zero percent and the things that we're
 
01:46:11.270 --> 01:46:11.280 align:start position:0%
thinking about there are inflation
 
01:46:14.990 --> 01:46:15.000 align:start position:0%
um it seems to be calming down a little
 
01:46:15.000 --> 01:46:16.310 align:start position:0%
um it seems to be calming down a little
bit

01:46:16.310 --> 01:46:16.320 align:start position:0%
bit
 
01:46:18.770 --> 01:46:18.780 align:start position:0%
um and so it's not climbing at the same
 
01:46:21.729 --> 01:46:21.739 align:start position:0%
rate that it had in the prior year
 
01:46:24.290 --> 01:46:24.300 align:start position:0%
we are keeping an eye on employment
 
01:46:28.070 --> 01:46:28.080 align:start position:0%
numbers employment is still strong and
 
01:46:31.270 --> 01:46:31.280 align:start position:0%
the the expectations coming out of the
 
01:46:34.070 --> 01:46:34.080 align:start position:0%
Employment Security Department are that
 
01:46:36.290 --> 01:46:36.300 align:start position:0%
we're still doing quite well in terms of
 
01:46:38.629 --> 01:46:38.639 align:start position:0%
employment when that number starts to
 
01:46:40.370 --> 01:46:40.380 align:start position:0%
grow is when we kind of start we'll
 
01:46:41.930 --> 01:46:41.940 align:start position:0%
start to get a little bit more nervous
 
01:46:45.290 --> 01:46:45.300 align:start position:0%
about where the economy is heading
 
01:46:47.510 --> 01:46:47.520 align:start position:0%
I think though at this point the biggest
 
01:46:50.149 --> 01:46:50.159 align:start position:0%
unknown is the debt ceiling and what is
 
01:46:52.490 --> 01:46:52.500 align:start position:0%
going to happen there if nothing happens
 
01:46:54.590 --> 01:46:54.600 align:start position:0%
there these numbers would look very
 
01:46:54.600 --> 01:46:55.669 align:start position:0%
there these numbers would look very
different

01:46:55.669 --> 01:46:55.679 align:start position:0%
different
 
01:46:58.010 --> 01:46:58.020 align:start position:0%
um but that is is an unknown and
 
01:46:59.570 --> 01:46:59.580 align:start position:0%
something that we can't really factor in
 
01:47:00.890 --> 01:47:00.900 align:start position:0%
at this point but it's something that
 
01:47:02.570 --> 01:47:02.580 align:start position:0%
we're watching
 
01:47:04.070 --> 01:47:04.080 align:start position:0%
um so
 
01:47:05.990 --> 01:47:06.000 align:start position:0%
the zero to two percent like I said is
 
01:47:08.270 --> 01:47:08.280 align:start position:0%
really the result of our Revenue numbers
 
01:47:10.850 --> 01:47:10.860 align:start position:0%
still look really strong
 
01:47:12.890 --> 01:47:12.900 align:start position:0%
um but we know that there are at least
 
01:47:15.229 --> 01:47:15.239 align:start position:0%
some cooling factors in the economy and
 
01:47:17.270 --> 01:47:17.280 align:start position:0%
that we shouldn't expect the continued
 
01:47:19.729 --> 01:47:19.739 align:start position:0%
growth that we've seen and we should
 
01:47:22.850 --> 01:47:22.860 align:start position:0%
what we're feeling is a reduction in the
 
01:47:24.470 --> 01:47:24.480 align:start position:0%
growth but not necessarily a turn
 
01:47:26.450 --> 01:47:26.460 align:start position:0%
negative and so that's why the bottom is
 
01:47:30.410 --> 01:47:30.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:32.810 --> 01:47:32.820 align:start position:0%
representative Mommy
 
01:47:36.109 --> 01:47:36.119 align:start position:0%
thank you we have two factors coming
 
01:47:41.270 --> 01:47:41.280 align:start position:0%
into play starting in 24. on credit
 
01:47:44.209 --> 01:47:44.219 align:start position:0%
carry forward you mentioned
 
01:47:47.629 --> 01:47:47.639 align:start position:0%
um there's some changes initial changes
 
01:47:50.930 --> 01:47:50.940 align:start position:0%
in it and what were they so those were
 
01:47:53.149 --> 01:47:53.159 align:start position:0%
the same for fiscal 24 the Senate
 
01:47:55.550 --> 01:47:55.560 align:start position:0%
estimates use the same numbers that you
 
01:47:58.750 --> 01:47:58.760 align:start position:0%
had which was we're anticipating
 
01:48:04.010 --> 01:48:04.020 align:start position:0%
a two uh 13 and a half million dollar
 
01:48:06.470 --> 01:48:06.480 align:start position:0%
reduction in revenues or due to the CCO
 
01:48:09.950 --> 01:48:09.960 align:start position:0%
cap in 24 and a 3.8 million reduction in
 
01:48:12.590 --> 01:48:12.600 align:start position:0%
25 those numbers didn't change from the
 
01:48:14.930 --> 01:48:14.940 align:start position:0%
house to the Senate no what I said
 
01:48:19.010 --> 01:48:19.020 align:start position:0%
changed was fiscal 23 impact
 
01:48:21.229 --> 01:48:21.239 align:start position:0%
because we have started to see some
 
01:48:25.550 --> 01:48:25.560 align:start position:0%
refunds in fiscal 23. so the number that
 
01:48:29.750 --> 01:48:29.760 align:start position:0%
that no that's fine the number that the
 
01:48:33.350 --> 01:48:33.360 align:start position:0%
house was given in fiscal 23 for the
 
01:48:38.030 --> 01:48:38.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:40.550 --> 01:48:40.560 align:start position:0%
was 11 million
 
01:48:44.030 --> 01:48:44.040 align:start position:0%
and when we presented to the Senate we
 
01:48:45.770 --> 01:48:45.780 align:start position:0%
reduced that number to eight and a half
 
01:48:49.129 --> 01:48:49.139 align:start position:0%
million because we had seen some refunds
 
01:48:51.830 --> 01:48:51.840 align:start position:0%
starting to happen so it was only for
 
01:48:54.770 --> 01:48:54.780 align:start position:0%
fiscal 23 that we modified that number
 
01:48:57.490 --> 01:48:57.500 align:start position:0%
for the Senate
 
01:49:04.370 --> 01:49:04.380 align:start position:0%
so you don't one of the fears is that
 
01:49:07.250 --> 01:49:07.260 align:start position:0%
if we head towards recession that more
 
01:49:12.229 --> 01:49:12.239 align:start position:0%
on people are going to upfront their uh
 
01:49:14.689 --> 01:49:14.699 align:start position:0%
taking back what they've got in the
 
01:49:18.070 --> 01:49:18.080 align:start position:0%
treasury and you haven't seen any
 
01:49:21.050 --> 01:49:21.060 align:start position:0%
discussion even of that yet we have not
 
01:49:23.689 --> 01:49:23.699 align:start position:0%
and that decision is really a business
 
01:49:26.870 --> 01:49:26.880 align:start position:0%
by business decision some will choose to
 
01:49:29.209 --> 01:49:29.219 align:start position:0%
bring the cash back because they want
 
01:49:31.149 --> 01:49:31.159 align:start position:0%
the cash back in their own accounts
 
01:49:35.149 --> 01:49:35.159 align:start position:0%
others when the economy is looking like
 
01:49:37.790 --> 01:49:37.800 align:start position:0%
it is heading to into some sort of a
 
01:49:39.890 --> 01:49:39.900 align:start position:0%
Slowdown or a recession they will leave
 
01:49:42.109 --> 01:49:42.119 align:start position:0%
their CCO with us to make sure that they
 
01:49:43.550 --> 01:49:43.560 align:start position:0%
have enough money with us to make their
 
01:49:45.590 --> 01:49:45.600 align:start position:0%
payments and not occur additional
 
01:49:48.169 --> 01:49:48.179 align:start position:0%
penalties and interest so it really is a
 
01:49:50.390 --> 01:49:50.400 align:start position:0%
business by business decision
 
01:49:54.709 --> 01:49:54.719 align:start position:0%
could could I the second Factor on the
 
01:49:58.310 --> 01:49:58.320 align:start position:0%
single sales Factor we are losing
 
01:50:02.030 --> 01:50:02.040 align:start position:0%
a number of very large businesses that
 
01:50:05.510 --> 01:50:05.520 align:start position:0%
sell outside the state produce and sell
 
01:50:08.330 --> 01:50:08.340 align:start position:0%
outside the state on
 
01:50:10.250 --> 01:50:10.260 align:start position:0%
have few
 
01:50:13.310 --> 01:50:13.320 align:start position:0%
do you feel fairly confident that we're
 
01:50:16.550 --> 01:50:16.560 align:start position:0%
going to be able to replace those with
 
01:50:19.669 --> 01:50:19.679 align:start position:0%
companies that we haven't yet had much
 
01:50:23.209 --> 01:50:23.219 align:start position:0%
or any from that are going to be selling
 
01:50:28.010 --> 01:50:28.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:31.189 --> 01:50:31.199 align:start position:0%
the short answer to that question is yes
 
01:50:35.750 --> 01:50:35.760 align:start position:0%
I don't feel like businesses moving out
 
01:50:38.390 --> 01:50:38.400 align:start position:0%
of the state or only selling outside of
 
01:50:40.070 --> 01:50:40.080 align:start position:0%
the state
 
01:50:43.729 --> 01:50:43.739 align:start position:0%
um will will not be at least mostly made
 
01:50:46.669 --> 01:50:46.679 align:start position:0%
up by sales into the state for which we
 
01:50:46.679 --> 01:50:47.990 align:start position:0%
up by sales into the state for which we
didn't

01:50:47.990 --> 01:50:48.000 align:start position:0%
didn't
 
01:50:48.000 --> 01:50:48.709 align:start position:0%
didn't
um

01:50:48.709 --> 01:50:48.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:50:51.709 --> 01:50:51.719 align:start position:0%
we didn't count or get as much
 
01:50:54.709 --> 01:50:54.719 align:start position:0%
apportionment from previously so we
 
01:50:57.590 --> 01:50:57.600 align:start position:0%
cannot fully analyze that because that
 
01:50:59.570 --> 01:50:59.580 align:start position:0%
change is still relatively new but again
 
01:51:01.010 --> 01:51:01.020 align:start position:0%
the number the revenue numbers look
 
01:51:04.790 --> 01:51:04.800 align:start position:0%
strong so I'm not seeing it causing a
 
01:51:07.010 --> 01:51:07.020 align:start position:0%
drastic impact at this point on our
 
01:51:07.020 --> 01:51:08.629 align:start position:0%
drastic impact at this point on our
revenues

01:51:08.629 --> 01:51:08.639 align:start position:0%
revenues
 
01:51:10.850 --> 01:51:10.860 align:start position:0%
representative spilsbury
 
01:51:13.189 --> 01:51:13.199 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair I have two
 
01:51:15.169 --> 01:51:15.179 align:start position:0%
questions if I may okay
 
01:51:17.270 --> 01:51:17.280 align:start position:0%
work session so it's a little more fluid
 
01:51:20.629 --> 01:51:20.639 align:start position:0%
for questions thank you
 
01:51:23.390 --> 01:51:23.400 align:start position:0%
so the difference in timing of the house
 
01:51:26.390 --> 01:51:26.400 align:start position:0%
review in the Senate view is clear and
 
01:51:28.669 --> 01:51:28.679 align:start position:0%
the fact that March and April revenues
 
01:51:30.770 --> 01:51:30.780 align:start position:0%
continued to exceed particularly on the
 
01:51:34.310 --> 01:51:34.320 align:start position:0%
business and m r
 
01:51:35.990 --> 01:51:36.000 align:start position:0%
that's all clear
 
01:51:38.810 --> 01:51:38.820 align:start position:0%
so I don't find that at all surprising
 
01:51:41.390 --> 01:51:41.400 align:start position:0%
that it it's that it's reflected in FY
 
01:51:45.910 --> 01:51:45.920 align:start position:0%
23. I guess falling further on
 
01:51:49.609 --> 01:51:49.619 align:start position:0%
representative Ames line of inquiry
 
01:51:49.619 --> 01:51:51.229 align:start position:0%
representative Ames line of inquiry
what

01:51:51.229 --> 01:51:51.239 align:start position:0%
what
 
01:51:55.850 --> 01:51:55.860 align:start position:0%
what would give us hope that a recession
 
01:51:59.450 --> 01:51:59.460 align:start position:0%
isn't virtually inevitable given the
 
01:52:00.890 --> 01:52:00.900 align:start position:0%
fed's policy
 
01:52:00.900 --> 01:52:02.090 align:start position:0%
fed's policy
to

01:52:02.090 --> 01:52:02.100 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:52:04.490 --> 01:52:04.500 align:start position:0%
break things down
 
01:52:07.189 --> 01:52:07.199 align:start position:0%
uh and and why would we ex even if we're
 
01:52:07.199 --> 01:52:08.510 align:start position:0%
uh and and why would we ex even if we're
seeing

01:52:08.510 --> 01:52:08.520 align:start position:0%
seeing
 
01:52:11.390 --> 01:52:11.400 align:start position:0%
uh Stronger revenues in in 23 years we
 
01:52:13.669 --> 01:52:13.679 align:start position:0%
close out the final months why would we
 
01:52:17.629 --> 01:52:17.639 align:start position:0%
expect that to be repeated in 24 and 25.
 
01:52:20.689 --> 01:52:20.699 align:start position:0%
so the the fed's policy has been in
 
01:52:23.450 --> 01:52:23.460 align:start position:0%
place for quite a while now we've been
 
01:52:25.370 --> 01:52:25.380 align:start position:0%
they've been raising interest rates
 
01:52:28.450 --> 01:52:28.460 align:start position:0%
consistently for over a year
 
01:52:34.189 --> 01:52:34.199 align:start position:0%
and we haven't seen that yet result in a
 
01:52:34.199 --> 01:52:35.209 align:start position:0%
and we haven't seen that yet result in a
recession

01:52:35.209 --> 01:52:35.219 align:start position:0%
recession
 
01:52:36.830 --> 01:52:36.840 align:start position:0%
I think a lot of people expected that we
 
01:52:38.870 --> 01:52:38.880 align:start position:0%
would have seen a recession by now and
 
01:52:40.070 --> 01:52:40.080 align:start position:0%
we haven't
 
01:52:44.689 --> 01:52:44.699 align:start position:0%
so there is a part of me that hopes and
 
01:52:47.570 --> 01:52:47.580 align:start position:0%
believes that the FED is it being at
 
01:52:50.390 --> 01:52:50.400 align:start position:0%
least somewhat successful in cooling the
 
01:52:53.090 --> 01:52:53.100 align:start position:0%
economy without sending us into a
 
01:52:55.550 --> 01:52:55.560 align:start position:0%
recession I think what makes this a
 
01:52:57.709 --> 01:52:57.719 align:start position:0%
little bit different than
 
01:53:00.350 --> 01:53:00.360 align:start position:0%
prior instances of raising of interest
 
01:53:02.450 --> 01:53:02.460 align:start position:0%
rates is that there is a fair amount of
 
01:53:04.910 --> 01:53:04.920 align:start position:0%
money still in the economy as a result
 
01:53:07.189 --> 01:53:07.199 align:start position:0%
of the federal government infusion of
 
01:53:11.270 --> 01:53:11.280 align:start position:0%
Revenue during covid and so that may be
 
01:53:14.030 --> 01:53:14.040 align:start position:0%
helping to bolster what would have
 
01:53:16.609 --> 01:53:16.619 align:start position:0%
otherwise caused a recession as a result
 
01:53:20.270 --> 01:53:20.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:22.550 --> 01:53:22.560 align:start position:0%
um business taxes
 
01:53:26.689 --> 01:53:26.699 align:start position:0%
fiscal year to date
 
01:53:39.770 --> 01:53:39.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:41.510 --> 01:53:41.520 align:start position:0%
through April were five and a half
 
01:53:44.209 --> 01:53:44.219 align:start position:0%
percent ahead of Prior year
 
01:53:46.550 --> 01:53:46.560 align:start position:0%
so I don't anticipate that growth to
 
01:53:48.709 --> 01:53:48.719 align:start position:0%
continue which is how we kind of get to
 
01:53:52.669 --> 01:53:52.679 align:start position:0%
the zero to two I believe when the house
 
01:53:52.679 --> 01:53:54.189 align:start position:0%
the zero to two I believe when the house
did

01:53:54.189 --> 01:53:54.199 align:start position:0%
did
 
01:53:57.109 --> 01:53:57.119 align:start position:0%
their estimates you had a slightly
 
01:53:59.090 --> 01:53:59.100 align:start position:0%
negative growth before the tax law
 
01:54:01.609 --> 01:54:01.619 align:start position:0%
changes and then the Senate took a one
 
01:54:03.530 --> 01:54:03.540 align:start position:0%
percent growth took the middle of our
 
01:54:07.970 --> 01:54:07.980 align:start position:0%
range for 23 to 24. so just further on
 
01:54:09.590 --> 01:54:09.600 align:start position:0%
the first question yeah
 
01:54:11.689 --> 01:54:11.699 align:start position:0%
I think that's an outstanding
 
01:54:15.229 --> 01:54:15.239 align:start position:0%
explanation and I accept that anything
 
01:54:17.209 --> 01:54:17.219 align:start position:0%
that we try to project is just purely
 
01:54:17.219 --> 01:54:18.410 align:start position:0%
that we try to project is just purely
speculative

01:54:18.410 --> 01:54:18.420 align:start position:0%
speculative
 
01:54:21.410 --> 01:54:21.420 align:start position:0%
but I do work I'm less optimistic
 
01:54:23.510 --> 01:54:23.520 align:start position:0%
because I do think that it's the stated
 
01:54:26.390 --> 01:54:26.400 align:start position:0%
intention of the Fed
 
01:54:26.400 --> 01:54:27.649 align:start position:0%
intention of the Fed
to

01:54:27.649 --> 01:54:27.659 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:54:30.169 --> 01:54:30.179 align:start position:0%
yes they've been trying for a year to
 
01:54:31.850 --> 01:54:31.860 align:start position:0%
get a reaction and they haven't gotten
 
01:54:33.229 --> 01:54:33.239 align:start position:0%
it so they're basically saying we're
 
01:54:34.669 --> 01:54:34.679 align:start position:0%
going to keep doing this until something
 
01:54:38.090 --> 01:54:38.100 align:start position:0%
breaks sure that's that's my just to
 
01:54:39.530 --> 01:54:39.540 align:start position:0%
close out that first
 
01:54:41.209 --> 01:54:41.219 align:start position:0%
second question
 
01:54:44.270 --> 01:54:44.280 align:start position:0%
um I see uh in the entries at the bottom
 
01:54:46.810 --> 01:54:46.820 align:start position:0%
of the page the changes to current law
 
01:54:50.149 --> 01:54:50.159 align:start position:0%
uh the best item there
 
01:54:53.590 --> 01:54:53.600 align:start position:0%
is the acceleration of the IND repeal
 
01:54:57.109 --> 01:54:57.119 align:start position:0%
and since there's no action yet by the
 
01:54:57.119 --> 01:54:59.030 align:start position:0%
and since there's no action yet by the
Senate

01:54:59.030 --> 01:54:59.040 align:start position:0%
Senate
 
01:55:02.030 --> 01:55:02.040 align:start position:0%
um that magnifies the uh the difference
 
01:55:04.390 --> 01:55:04.400 align:start position:0%
in fy25
 
01:55:07.250 --> 01:55:07.260 align:start position:0%
but I'm just wondering status since I
 
01:55:08.689 --> 01:55:08.699 align:start position:0%
haven't been following where the
 
01:55:10.250 --> 01:55:10.260 align:start position:0%
Senate's at if they've just adopted
 
01:55:13.310 --> 01:55:13.320 align:start position:0%
these Revenue estimates last Wednesday
 
01:55:15.229 --> 01:55:15.239 align:start position:0%
where are they at with the budget Bill
 
01:55:17.930 --> 01:55:17.940 align:start position:0%
and are there tax law or tax rate
 
01:55:20.450 --> 01:55:20.460 align:start position:0%
changes that are likely to come forward
 
01:55:22.729 --> 01:55:22.739 align:start position:0%
in the Senate budget bill
 
01:55:24.950 --> 01:55:24.960 align:start position:0%
So currently the finance committee
 
01:55:26.450 --> 01:55:26.460 align:start position:0%
Senate finance committee is in the
 
01:55:30.290 --> 01:55:30.300 align:start position:0%
process of making some decisions they'll
 
01:55:32.750 --> 01:55:32.760 align:start position:0%
complete decisions potentially by next
 
01:55:35.770 --> 01:55:35.780 align:start position:0%
Friday or the following Tuesday
 
01:55:38.270 --> 01:55:38.280 align:start position:0%
they still have some outstanding issues
 
01:55:41.689 --> 01:55:41.699 align:start position:0%
that they're discussing and and still
 
01:55:43.669 --> 01:55:43.679 align:start position:0%
debating so there's not much I can say
 
01:55:45.649 --> 01:55:45.659 align:start position:0%
at this point there has been no action
 
01:55:47.870 --> 01:55:47.880 align:start position:0%
taken on the IND
 
01:55:47.880 --> 01:55:48.590 align:start position:0%
taken on the IND
um

01:55:48.590 --> 01:55:48.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:55:51.169 --> 01:55:51.179 align:start position:0%
suspect yet fair enough then would it be
 
01:55:53.450 --> 01:55:53.460 align:start position:0%
correct to say that
 
01:55:56.810 --> 01:55:56.820 align:start position:0%
the Senate's actions such as they may
 
01:55:59.030 --> 01:55:59.040 align:start position:0%
turn out to be are not yet reflected in
 
01:56:01.070 --> 01:56:01.080 align:start position:0%
this chart and may close that apparent
 
01:56:02.270 --> 01:56:02.280 align:start position:0%
Gap a bit
 
01:56:05.510 --> 01:56:05.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:06.830 --> 01:56:06.840 align:start position:0%
my hands up over here the first
 
01:56:08.629 --> 01:56:08.639 align:start position:0%
representative fellows so I'm sorry if I
 
01:56:10.430 --> 01:56:10.440 align:start position:0%
could just so really what you want to
 
01:56:12.830 --> 01:56:12.840 align:start position:0%
focus on is that the top part of that I
 
01:56:14.510 --> 01:56:14.520 align:start position:0%
put the bottom part on this just to
 
01:56:16.729 --> 01:56:16.739 align:start position:0%
remind you what the house did so as we
 
01:56:18.410 --> 01:56:18.420 align:start position:0%
move forward through the Senate phase if
 
01:56:19.669 --> 01:56:19.679 align:start position:0%
you're paying attention you'll say oh
 
01:56:21.229 --> 01:56:21.239 align:start position:0%
they did the same thing or they didn't
 
01:56:23.030 --> 01:56:23.040 align:start position:0%
and then you can make some adjustments
 
01:56:27.770 --> 01:56:27.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:31.189 --> 01:56:31.199 align:start position:0%
kind of on the same topic so I just
 
01:56:33.430 --> 01:56:33.440 align:start position:0%
wanted more clarification on those
 
01:56:36.229 --> 01:56:36.239 align:start position:0%
changes to current law or are they
 
01:56:39.590 --> 01:56:39.600 align:start position:0%
proposed changes to current law and then
 
01:56:42.470 --> 01:56:42.480 align:start position:0%
I see that there's something that
 
01:56:44.209 --> 01:56:44.219 align:start position:0%
doesn't have anything to do with Revenue
 
01:56:47.510 --> 01:56:47.520 align:start position:0%
total revenue but for the education
 
01:56:49.430 --> 01:56:49.440 align:start position:0%
between the general fund and the
 
01:56:52.910 --> 01:56:52.920 align:start position:0%
education trust fund that some of the
 
01:56:58.850 --> 01:56:58.860 align:start position:0%
bet money was being moved out out of the
 
01:57:01.370 --> 01:57:01.380 align:start position:0%
general fund right into the trust fund
 
01:57:05.209 --> 01:57:05.219 align:start position:0%
what so explain what that was
 
01:57:07.910 --> 01:57:07.920 align:start position:0%
So currently the it is proposed it's the
 
01:57:09.410 --> 01:57:09.420 align:start position:0%
house position it's the house proposed
 
01:57:11.270 --> 01:57:11.280 align:start position:0%
change it's the current law that you're
 
01:57:13.550 --> 01:57:13.560 align:start position:0%
seeing reflected there
 
01:57:16.250 --> 01:57:16.260 align:start position:0%
those changes are shown on the Surplus
 
01:57:18.050 --> 01:57:18.060 align:start position:0%
statement as you recall when I came
 
01:57:19.189 --> 01:57:19.199 align:start position:0%
before you
 
01:57:21.470 --> 01:57:21.480 align:start position:0%
um earlier this season
 
01:57:23.149 --> 01:57:23.159 align:start position:0%
um any current Law changes would be
 
01:57:25.550 --> 01:57:25.560 align:start position:0%
reflected on the the Surplus statement I
 
01:57:27.290 --> 01:57:27.300 align:start position:0%
carry them here just so you can see an
 
01:57:29.390 --> 01:57:29.400 align:start position:0%
Apples to Apples once all decisions are
 
01:57:29.400 --> 01:57:30.709 align:start position:0%
Apples to Apples once all decisions are
made

01:57:30.709 --> 01:57:30.719 align:start position:0%
made
 
01:57:32.570 --> 01:57:32.580 align:start position:0%
um because this is the general fund
 
01:57:35.209 --> 01:57:35.219 align:start position:0%
education trust fund combined you don't
 
01:57:36.950 --> 01:57:36.960 align:start position:0%
see the um
 
01:57:40.189 --> 01:57:40.199 align:start position:0%
the difference on where BPT b-e-t is
 
01:57:41.750 --> 01:57:41.760 align:start position:0%
going for the education trust funded
 
01:57:43.010 --> 01:57:43.020 align:start position:0%
general fund that I'll be showing on the
 
01:57:45.410 --> 01:57:45.420 align:start position:0%
next two pages so I haven't gotten there
 
01:57:47.149 --> 01:57:47.159 align:start position:0%
yet but there's a piece in House Bill
 
01:57:49.550 --> 01:57:49.560 align:start position:0%
too that would change how
 
01:57:51.890 --> 01:57:51.900 align:start position:0%
um the business taxes are allocated to
 
01:57:54.530 --> 01:57:54.540 align:start position:0%
the education trust fund and the
 
01:57:58.870 --> 01:57:58.880 align:start position:0%
um general fund okay so that switch is
 
01:58:03.350 --> 01:58:03.360 align:start position:0%
in the house version of hb2 that is
 
01:58:05.570 --> 01:58:05.580 align:start position:0%
correct okay and these are all things
 
01:58:08.330 --> 01:58:08.340 align:start position:0%
that were in the house version because
 
01:58:12.530 --> 01:58:12.540 align:start position:0%
we don't have the hb2 that's correct
 
01:58:15.770 --> 01:58:15.780 align:start position:0%
they haven't finished that work yet
 
01:58:15.780 --> 01:58:17.990 align:start position:0%
they haven't finished that work yet
representative

01:58:17.990 --> 01:58:18.000 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:58:19.669 --> 01:58:19.679 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking my
 
01:58:22.129 --> 01:58:22.139 align:start position:0%
question I share some of Representative
 
01:58:24.830 --> 01:58:24.840 align:start position:0%
spillsbury's concerns we haven't hit a
 
01:58:26.270 --> 01:58:26.280 align:start position:0%
recession yet
 
01:58:29.390 --> 01:58:29.400 align:start position:0%
but it's the last inflation or monthly
 
01:58:31.129 --> 01:58:31.139 align:start position:0%
inflation rate was five five and a half
 
01:58:33.709 --> 01:58:33.719 align:start position:0%
percent somewhere in that range well
 
01:58:35.330 --> 01:58:35.340 align:start position:0%
above the two percent
 
01:58:37.729 --> 01:58:37.739 align:start position:0%
Target that feds and I don't buy the two
 
01:58:40.010 --> 01:58:40.020 align:start position:0%
percent I'd make it zero but they have a
 
01:58:42.050 --> 01:58:42.060 align:start position:0%
two percent upper limit Target
 
01:58:44.209 --> 01:58:44.219 align:start position:0%
uh so they're going to continue to raise
 
01:58:46.729 --> 01:58:46.739 align:start position:0%
interest rates maybe at a slower Pace
 
01:58:49.310 --> 01:58:49.320 align:start position:0%
because of the impact on banking but as
 
01:58:51.530 --> 01:58:51.540 align:start position:0%
they do that it's eventually going to
 
01:58:53.330 --> 01:58:53.340 align:start position:0%
have an impact I one would think it may
 
01:58:55.189 --> 01:58:55.199 align:start position:0%
be delayed because uh
 
01:58:57.470 --> 01:58:57.480 align:start position:0%
of a federal money sloshing around from
 
01:58:59.330 --> 01:58:59.340 align:start position:0%
all the federal stimuli but that's
 
01:59:02.149 --> 01:59:02.159 align:start position:0%
frying up so you you share that Center
 
01:59:04.189 --> 01:59:04.199 align:start position:0%
but do you think are more optimistic
 
01:59:07.310 --> 01:59:07.320 align:start position:0%
than I am no I I do share that sentiment
 
01:59:12.070 --> 01:59:12.080 align:start position:0%
and so I think what it comes down to is
 
01:59:16.070 --> 01:59:16.080 align:start position:0%
does that impact on interest rates and
 
01:59:19.189 --> 01:59:19.199 align:start position:0%
hopefully lowering inflation cool the
 
01:59:23.270 --> 01:59:23.280 align:start position:0%
growth or result in negative growth
 
01:59:26.750 --> 01:59:26.760 align:start position:0%
and what we what we believe at this
 
01:59:28.609 --> 01:59:28.619 align:start position:0%
point is that it's going to cool that
 
01:59:31.490 --> 01:59:31.500 align:start position:0%
growth from the five purse five and a
 
01:59:32.750 --> 01:59:32.760 align:start position:0%
half almost six percent that we're
 
01:59:34.609 --> 01:59:34.619 align:start position:0%
seeing now
 
01:59:40.910 --> 01:59:40.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:44.270 --> 01:59:44.280 align:start position:0%
was at six percent so we have seen a
 
01:59:46.609 --> 01:59:46.619 align:start position:0%
little bit of a cooling of that growth I
 
01:59:48.589 --> 01:59:48.599 align:start position:0%
think that will continue and it will
 
01:59:50.810 --> 01:59:50.820 align:start position:0%
accelerate it will that we went from six
 
01:59:52.430 --> 01:59:52.440 align:start position:0%
and percent year-over-year growth we're
 
01:59:53.810 --> 01:59:53.820 align:start position:0%
currently at five and a half percent
 
01:59:56.510 --> 01:59:56.520 align:start position:0%
your over your growth I very much think
 
01:59:59.149 --> 01:59:59.159 align:start position:0%
that will cool hence the zero to two
 
02:00:01.370 --> 02:00:01.380 align:start position:0%
percent we are just at this point not
 
02:00:04.490 --> 02:00:04.500 align:start position:0%
predicting that it will go negative
 
02:00:06.649 --> 02:00:06.659 align:start position:0%
and we could be wrong
 
02:00:09.470 --> 02:00:09.480 align:start position:0%
but it and and to your point though the
 
02:00:12.470 --> 02:00:12.480 align:start position:0%
timing of you know potential Federal
 
02:00:15.050 --> 02:00:15.060 align:start position:0%
monies drying up
 
02:00:15.060 --> 02:00:16.370 align:start position:0%
monies drying up
um

02:00:16.370 --> 02:00:16.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:00:20.390 --> 02:00:20.400 align:start position:0%
the the timing of when you know if and
 
02:00:24.470 --> 02:00:24.480 align:start position:0%
when we see really employment issues in
 
02:00:26.390 --> 02:00:26.400 align:start position:0%
all sectors employment issues at the
 
02:00:29.270 --> 02:00:29.280 align:start position:0%
moment tend to be in certain industries
 
02:00:31.430 --> 02:00:31.440 align:start position:0%
you hear of you know Tech layoffs but
 
02:00:33.050 --> 02:00:33.060 align:start position:0%
then you hear of other industries that
 
02:00:35.030 --> 02:00:35.040 align:start position:0%
you know will hire anybody because they
 
02:00:37.669 --> 02:00:37.679 align:start position:0%
need bodies when that employment issue
 
02:00:40.930 --> 02:00:40.940 align:start position:0%
starts to become more even me
 
02:00:43.250 --> 02:00:43.260 align:start position:0%
when that employment issue starts to
 
02:00:44.810 --> 02:00:44.820 align:start position:0%
become if and when that becomes more
 
02:00:47.570 --> 02:00:47.580 align:start position:0%
broad-based or the impacts to Industries
 
02:00:49.490 --> 02:00:49.500 align:start position:0%
become more broad-based and we see the
 
02:00:53.030 --> 02:00:53.040 align:start position:0%
impacts affecting every business that's
 
02:00:56.870 --> 02:00:56.880 align:start position:0%
when I think we might go negative
 
02:00:59.089 --> 02:00:59.099 align:start position:0%
um and again as we've talked about
 
02:00:59.099 --> 02:01:00.589 align:start position:0%
um and again as we've talked about
previously

02:01:00.589 --> 02:01:00.599 align:start position:0%
previously
 
02:01:03.109 --> 02:01:03.119 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire doesn't tend to our
 
02:01:05.930 --> 02:01:05.940 align:start position:0%
revenues in a recession do not fall as
 
02:01:09.229 --> 02:01:09.239 align:start position:0%
far as other states we don't see you
 
02:01:11.689 --> 02:01:11.699 align:start position:0%
know a drastic decrease in revenues we
 
02:01:13.970 --> 02:01:13.980 align:start position:0%
don't fall as far but we take longer to
 
02:01:16.370 --> 02:01:16.380 align:start position:0%
recover so think of like the Nike Swoosh
 
02:01:18.830 --> 02:01:18.840 align:start position:0%
right it's a little bit of a drop and
 
02:01:21.830 --> 02:01:21.840 align:start position:0%
then a longer recovery so I think that
 
02:01:24.229 --> 02:01:24.239 align:start position:0%
historical perspective is factoring into
 
02:01:26.629 --> 02:01:26.639 align:start position:0%
our estimates as well
 
02:01:35.169 --> 02:01:35.179 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:38.930 --> 02:01:38.940 align:start position:0%
at ncsl on them I think four years ago
 
02:01:41.810 --> 02:01:41.820 align:start position:0%
on and I haven't been able to follow it
 
02:01:44.709 --> 02:01:44.719 align:start position:0%
up since there was a very good
 
02:01:49.490 --> 02:01:49.500 align:start position:0%
analyst who mentioned in response to a
 
02:01:53.510 --> 02:01:53.520 align:start position:0%
question of mind that there the feds
 
02:01:59.149 --> 02:01:59.159 align:start position:0%
are once a year on take a survey of all
 
02:02:02.689 --> 02:02:02.699 align:start position:0%
of the bank accounts in America and they
 
02:02:02.699 --> 02:02:04.510 align:start position:0%
of the bank accounts in America and they
uh

02:02:04.510 --> 02:02:04.520 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:02:08.030 --> 02:02:08.040 align:start position:0%
in the spring as I recall but you don't
 
02:02:11.890 --> 02:02:11.900 align:start position:0%
get the results until the fall and they
 
02:02:15.890 --> 02:02:15.900 align:start position:0%
analyze it by income level I don't know
 
02:02:19.129 --> 02:02:19.139 align:start position:0%
if they'd all they recall if they also
 
02:02:22.970 --> 02:02:22.980 align:start position:0%
do it by uh industrial sector or
 
02:02:24.589 --> 02:02:24.599 align:start position:0%
whatever that would be harder because
 
02:02:27.350 --> 02:02:27.360 align:start position:0%
they're mixing up all of the accounts
 
02:02:29.750 --> 02:02:29.760 align:start position:0%
not just the individual accounts
 
02:02:29.760 --> 02:02:31.070 align:start position:0%
not just the individual accounts
and

02:02:31.070 --> 02:02:31.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:02:34.189 --> 02:02:34.199 align:start position:0%
um I wonder if we could get a copy of
 
02:02:36.649 --> 02:02:36.659 align:start position:0%
last year's in the year before even
 
02:02:40.450 --> 02:02:40.460 align:start position:0%
knowing what it had been moving between
 
02:02:46.010 --> 02:02:46.020 align:start position:0%
21 and 22 would be some kind of
 
02:02:50.149 --> 02:02:50.159 align:start position:0%
of help on one of my theories and his
 
02:02:53.030 --> 02:02:53.040 align:start position:0%
actually was that that the money would
 
02:02:56.330 --> 02:02:56.340 align:start position:0%
die out of the accounts of lower income
 
02:03:00.229 --> 02:03:00.239 align:start position:0%
people first and then gradually come up
 
02:03:02.930 --> 02:03:02.940 align:start position:0%
to a level where you were talking people
 
02:03:05.149 --> 02:03:05.159 align:start position:0%
with real money or corporations with
 
02:03:06.910 --> 02:03:06.920 align:start position:0%
real money
 
02:03:09.530 --> 02:03:09.540 align:start position:0%
we both took a note of that so between
 
02:03:11.209 --> 02:03:11.219 align:start position:0%
the two of us hopefully we can track
 
02:03:16.729 --> 02:03:16.739 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:18.890 --> 02:03:18.900 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
02:03:22.669 --> 02:03:22.679 align:start position:0%
um I agree with the idea that um
 
02:03:24.530 --> 02:03:24.540 align:start position:0%
the FED is going to continue raising to
 
02:03:26.870 --> 02:03:26.880 align:start position:0%
get to two percent we don't know where
 
02:03:29.149 --> 02:03:29.159 align:start position:0%
that's going to land but this morning
 
02:03:30.950 --> 02:03:30.960 align:start position:0%
and previous to this morning I've read
 
02:03:33.229 --> 02:03:33.239 align:start position:0%
articles about how there's a continuing
 
02:03:33.239 --> 02:03:34.490 align:start position:0%
articles about how there's a continuing
credit

02:03:34.490 --> 02:03:34.500 align:start position:0%
credit
 
02:03:36.229 --> 02:03:36.239 align:start position:0%
crunch that's that's starting to grow
 
02:03:39.290 --> 02:03:39.300 align:start position:0%
where people are the other thing that's
 
02:03:41.030 --> 02:03:41.040 align:start position:0%
possibly leveling this out right now is
 
02:03:43.609 --> 02:03:43.619 align:start position:0%
people using their credit cards and with
 
02:03:45.350 --> 02:03:45.360 align:start position:0%
credit card balances continuing to
 
02:03:48.109 --> 02:03:48.119 align:start position:0%
increase at some point they can't
 
02:03:50.750 --> 02:03:50.760 align:start position:0%
increase anymore and so the the multiple
 
02:03:53.750 --> 02:03:53.760 align:start position:0%
factors of the FED uh stated goal of
 
02:03:55.550 --> 02:03:55.560 align:start position:0%
continuing to raise rates until they hit
 
02:03:59.109 --> 02:03:59.119 align:start position:0%
two percent inflation coupled with
 
02:04:02.089 --> 02:04:02.099 align:start position:0%
the credit card crunch that seems to be
 
02:04:02.099 --> 02:04:03.709 align:start position:0%
the credit card crunch that seems to be
increasing

02:04:03.709 --> 02:04:03.719 align:start position:0%
increasing
 
02:04:03.719 --> 02:04:04.370 align:start position:0%
increasing
um

02:04:04.370 --> 02:04:04.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:04:06.410 --> 02:04:06.420 align:start position:0%
could also could you know would you
 
02:04:08.930 --> 02:04:08.940 align:start position:0%
agree that that could also cause a
 
02:04:08.940 --> 02:04:10.129 align:start position:0%
agree that that could also cause a
Slowdown

02:04:10.129 --> 02:04:10.139 align:start position:0%
Slowdown
 
02:04:13.070 --> 02:04:13.080 align:start position:0%
I do agree and the other tax type to
 
02:04:14.510 --> 02:04:14.520 align:start position:0%
consider with that is the meals and
 
02:04:16.790 --> 02:04:16.800 align:start position:0%
rentals tax because that's how do you
 
02:04:18.410 --> 02:04:18.420 align:start position:0%
pay when you go out to dinner at a
 
02:04:19.850 --> 02:04:19.860 align:start position:0%
restaurant right most people play with
 
02:04:21.530 --> 02:04:21.540 align:start position:0%
your credit card how do you pay for
 
02:04:25.010 --> 02:04:25.020 align:start position:0%
hotel stays credit cards so that is
 
02:04:29.270 --> 02:04:29.280 align:start position:0%
another tax that we would keep an eye on
 
02:04:34.550 --> 02:04:34.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:34.560 --> 02:04:35.990 align:start position:0%
 
Philip

02:04:35.990 --> 02:04:36.000 align:start position:0%
Philip
 
02:04:38.629 --> 02:04:38.639 align:start position:0%
not completely Apollo but an additional
 
02:04:41.870 --> 02:04:41.880 align:start position:0%
concern for the economy is that I as a
 
02:04:44.629 --> 02:04:44.639 align:start position:0%
landlord over the past couple years have
 
02:04:47.810 --> 02:04:47.820 align:start position:0%
raised my rents because of increasing
 
02:04:50.810 --> 02:04:50.820 align:start position:0%
costs but one of the things I'm seeing
 
02:04:53.510 --> 02:04:53.520 align:start position:0%
is tenants are starting to max out on
 
02:04:54.830 --> 02:04:54.840 align:start position:0%
what they can afford
 
02:04:57.890 --> 02:04:57.900 align:start position:0%
that doesn't stop the cost side for me
 
02:05:00.410 --> 02:05:00.420 align:start position:0%
to keep increasing but
 
02:05:02.030 --> 02:05:02.040 align:start position:0%
you know I can't necessarily increase
 
02:05:04.129 --> 02:05:04.139 align:start position:0%
the rents anymore So eventually that's
 
02:05:05.990 --> 02:05:06.000 align:start position:0%
another factor and and not just
 
02:05:08.689 --> 02:05:08.699 align:start position:0%
landlords but you know any sort of uh
 
02:05:11.270 --> 02:05:11.280 align:start position:0%
store that's raising rates uh raising
 
02:05:13.850 --> 02:05:13.860 align:start position:0%
prices at some point the consumer just
 
02:05:16.010 --> 02:05:16.020 align:start position:0%
can't afford it anymore agreed I think
 
02:05:17.570 --> 02:05:17.580 align:start position:0%
we talked a little bit about that in
 
02:05:18.709 --> 02:05:18.719 align:start position:0%
this committee as well when you were
 
02:05:20.570 --> 02:05:20.580 align:start position:0%
doing your meals and rentals estimates
 
02:05:22.070 --> 02:05:22.080 align:start position:0%
right inflation is going to drive prices
 
02:05:23.450 --> 02:05:23.460 align:start position:0%
up costs are going to increase
 
02:05:24.890 --> 02:05:24.900 align:start position:0%
restaurants are going to increase prices
 
02:05:27.229 --> 02:05:27.239 align:start position:0%
which increases the tax since the tax is
 
02:05:29.629 --> 02:05:29.639 align:start position:0%
a function of the price until the point
 
02:05:31.970 --> 02:05:31.980 align:start position:0%
where either restaurants can't
 
02:05:33.470 --> 02:05:33.480 align:start position:0%
increase the price anymore because
 
02:05:35.810 --> 02:05:35.820 align:start position:0%
consumers just won't pay it the supply
 
02:05:38.629 --> 02:05:38.639 align:start position:0%
and demand doesn't work
 
02:05:41.930 --> 02:05:41.940 align:start position:0%
so effectively that could decrease m r
 
02:05:44.810 --> 02:05:44.820 align:start position:0%
taxes coming in and business profits
 
02:05:47.149 --> 02:05:47.159 align:start position:0%
taxed correct right okay other yes
 
02:05:49.189 --> 02:05:49.199 align:start position:0%
representative Schamberg or no
 
02:05:51.530 --> 02:05:51.540 align:start position:0%
Southworth thank you
 
02:05:53.330 --> 02:05:53.340 align:start position:0%
be partly propaganda but there have been
 
02:05:55.370 --> 02:05:55.380 align:start position:0%
several articles from people in that
 
02:05:57.709 --> 02:05:57.719 align:start position:0%
industry saying that their bookings are
 
02:05:59.330 --> 02:05:59.340 align:start position:0%
way up and they're expecting one of the
 
02:06:01.310 --> 02:06:01.320 align:start position:0%
biggest summers in many many years
 
02:06:03.410 --> 02:06:03.420 align:start position:0%
especially from people coming from
 
02:06:05.450 --> 02:06:05.460 align:start position:0%
Canada and so on so I know there's a lot
 
02:06:07.010 --> 02:06:07.020 align:start position:0%
of information it does seem kind of
 
02:06:09.890 --> 02:06:09.900 align:start position:0%
contradictory I think there was
 
02:06:11.510 --> 02:06:11.520 align:start position:0%
um a release yesterday from the division
 
02:06:14.089 --> 02:06:14.099 align:start position:0%
of travel and tourism expecting four and
 
02:06:17.990 --> 02:06:18.000 align:start position:0%
a half million dollars in Revenue to you
 
02:06:19.189 --> 02:06:19.199 align:start position:0%
know New Hampshire businesses this
 
02:06:22.609 --> 02:06:22.619 align:start position:0%
summer based on overnight stays so that
 
02:06:24.709 --> 02:06:24.719 align:start position:0%
it is expected that people will continue
 
02:06:28.490 --> 02:06:28.500 align:start position:0%
to travel here and stay here during the
 
02:06:30.770 --> 02:06:30.780 align:start position:0%
hearings in the Senate we also heard
 
02:06:33.709 --> 02:06:33.719 align:start position:0%
about the solar eclipse that is going to
 
02:06:38.450 --> 02:06:38.460 align:start position:0%
happen in April of next year and that
 
02:06:41.750 --> 02:06:41.760 align:start position:0%
bookings up north are already almost at
 
02:06:44.209 --> 02:06:44.219 align:start position:0%
capacity so if you haven't yet I would
 
02:06:46.310 --> 02:06:46.320 align:start position:0%
encourage you to to make a booking if
 
02:06:48.050 --> 02:06:48.060 align:start position:0%
you'd like to view that
 
02:06:49.669 --> 02:06:49.679 align:start position:0%
um and then we also in the Senate talked
 
02:06:51.050 --> 02:06:51.060 align:start position:0%
a little bit about the presidential
 
02:06:55.550 --> 02:06:55.560 align:start position:0%
primary as well with respect to m r and
 
02:06:57.470 --> 02:06:57.480 align:start position:0%
the fact that that can can generate some
 
02:07:02.390 --> 02:07:02.400 align:start position:0%
hostel stays and some meals and meals
 
02:07:05.810 --> 02:07:05.820 align:start position:0%
consumed drinks as well during that
 
02:07:09.770 --> 02:07:09.780 align:start position:0%
season so there it's all factors that
 
02:07:11.870 --> 02:07:11.880 align:start position:0%
need to be considered and I think the
 
02:07:15.729 --> 02:07:15.739 align:start position:0%
Senate did take that into account when
 
02:07:19.070 --> 02:07:19.080 align:start position:0%
estimating their growth rate for m r um
 
02:07:20.510 --> 02:07:20.520 align:start position:0%
thinking that some of these more special
 
02:07:23.270 --> 02:07:23.280 align:start position:0%
events May help bolster m r
 
02:07:28.189 --> 02:07:28.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:31.430 --> 02:07:31.440 align:start position:0%
representative yes the m r
 
02:07:34.129 --> 02:07:34.139 align:start position:0%
people raised their rent rates because
 
02:07:36.410 --> 02:07:36.420 align:start position:0%
to cover their costs that helps seminar
 
02:07:39.229 --> 02:07:39.239 align:start position:0%
correct and we're coming out of a
 
02:07:41.390 --> 02:07:41.400 align:start position:0%
post-covered lockdown essentially so
 
02:07:43.250 --> 02:07:43.260 align:start position:0%
people are traveling your right and
 
02:07:45.229 --> 02:07:45.239 align:start position:0%
spending money on meals but could you
 
02:07:47.270 --> 02:07:47.280 align:start position:0%
see that ending in other words they
 
02:07:50.050 --> 02:07:50.060 align:start position:0%
won't stop going out but to slow down
 
02:07:52.189 --> 02:07:52.199 align:start position:0%
in all honesty I thought we would have
 
02:07:55.729 --> 02:07:55.739 align:start position:0%
seen that already and and we haven't
 
02:07:57.790 --> 02:07:57.800 align:start position:0%
um and so the way we kind of refer to it
 
02:08:01.010 --> 02:08:01.020 align:start position:0%
at the dra when we're talking about it
 
02:08:04.850 --> 02:08:04.860 align:start position:0%
is kind of the new normal for m r we did
 
02:08:07.189 --> 02:08:07.199 align:start position:0%
expect a bump in m r Revenue coming out
 
02:08:09.410 --> 02:08:09.420 align:start position:0%
of covid but I expected that to kind of
 
02:08:11.209 --> 02:08:11.219 align:start position:0%
decrease pretty quickly right everybody
 
02:08:13.790 --> 02:08:13.800 align:start position:0%
catches up on their vacations
 
02:08:15.290 --> 02:08:15.300 align:start position:0%
um you know realizes how much they like
 
02:08:17.689 --> 02:08:17.699 align:start position:0%
to eat out they go out to dinner quite a
 
02:08:18.830 --> 02:08:18.840 align:start position:0%
bit but then they would kind of resort
 
02:08:22.070 --> 02:08:22.080 align:start position:0%
to their old habits but they we seem to
 
02:08:24.350 --> 02:08:24.360 align:start position:0%
have sustained a higher level of m r
 
02:08:27.109 --> 02:08:27.119 align:start position:0%
than we saw pre-pandemic one of the
 
02:08:28.430 --> 02:08:28.440 align:start position:0%
things that was mentioned during the
 
02:08:30.830 --> 02:08:30.840 align:start position:0%
Senate hearings that may be driving up
 
02:08:32.990 --> 02:08:33.000 align:start position:0%
that Revenue that may start to tail off
 
02:08:35.770 --> 02:08:35.780 align:start position:0%
is the pent-up demand for special events
 
02:08:39.050 --> 02:08:39.060 align:start position:0%
weddings business conferences large
 
02:08:42.830 --> 02:08:42.840 align:start position:0%
Gatherings of that sort there was a lot
 
02:08:44.570 --> 02:08:44.580 align:start position:0%
of pent-up demand for that that may have
 
02:08:46.850 --> 02:08:46.860 align:start position:0%
carried through the past few years that
 
02:08:49.609 --> 02:08:49.619 align:start position:0%
may be trailing off where you don't have
 
02:08:51.830 --> 02:08:51.840 align:start position:0%
you know weddings four or five nights a
 
02:08:54.229 --> 02:08:54.239 align:start position:0%
week because you had two years of people
 
02:08:56.149 --> 02:08:56.159 align:start position:0%
you know trying to get their events
 
02:09:01.570 --> 02:09:01.580 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:03.649 --> 02:09:03.659 align:start position:0%
representative only
 
02:09:06.830 --> 02:09:06.840 align:start position:0%
yes on I think it was about 10 years ago
 
02:09:13.189 --> 02:09:13.199 align:start position:0%
that I looked at the m r rates for March
 
02:09:16.490 --> 02:09:16.500 align:start position:0%
April May versus I'm not March April May
 
02:09:19.430 --> 02:09:19.440 align:start position:0%
but around the time the primary had
 
02:09:22.370 --> 02:09:22.380 align:start position:0%
happened and
 
02:09:26.570 --> 02:09:26.580 align:start position:0%
and outside of that time and didn't see
 
02:09:29.270 --> 02:09:29.280 align:start position:0%
any correlation
 
02:09:31.790 --> 02:09:31.800 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure that it results in a
 
02:09:35.209 --> 02:09:35.219 align:start position:0%
noticeable increase in m r When
 
02:09:37.970 --> 02:09:37.980 align:start position:0%
comparing to this to other months but I
 
02:09:40.490 --> 02:09:40.500 align:start position:0%
think more my point was it might help to
 
02:09:43.669 --> 02:09:43.679 align:start position:0%
kind of sustain m r in a period where it
 
02:09:46.070 --> 02:09:46.080 align:start position:0%
otherwise might be declining so maybe
 
02:09:48.050 --> 02:09:48.060 align:start position:0%
not a noticeable impact in normal times
 
02:09:50.330 --> 02:09:50.340 align:start position:0%
but it may help keep m r at a higher
 
02:09:53.030 --> 02:09:53.040 align:start position:0%
rate when it otherwise would decline
 
02:09:54.770 --> 02:09:54.780 align:start position:0%
representative leapley
 
02:09:56.390 --> 02:09:56.400 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:09:59.629 --> 02:09:59.639 align:start position:0%
um I'm looking at the differences column
 
02:10:04.850 --> 02:10:04.860 align:start position:0%
in FY 2024 and it looks like a lot a
 
02:10:06.490 --> 02:10:06.500 align:start position:0%
large number
 
02:10:11.689 --> 02:10:11.699 align:start position:0%
is the business taxes and m r right so
 
02:10:13.129 --> 02:10:13.139 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering
 
02:10:13.139 --> 02:10:14.030 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering
um

02:10:14.030 --> 02:10:14.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:10:15.709 --> 02:10:15.719 align:start position:0%
what happens
 
02:10:15.719 --> 02:10:17.870 align:start position:0%
what happens
if

02:10:17.870 --> 02:10:17.880 align:start position:0%
if
 
02:10:20.390 --> 02:10:20.400 align:start position:0%
the economy does slow down and those
 
02:10:22.490 --> 02:10:22.500 align:start position:0%
numbers look let's say they look like
 
02:10:24.830 --> 02:10:24.840 align:start position:0%
the 2023 numbers
 
02:10:24.840 --> 02:10:26.589 align:start position:0%
the 2023 numbers
and

02:10:26.589 --> 02:10:26.599 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:10:31.370 --> 02:10:31.380 align:start position:0%
the IND tax change passes
 
02:10:31.380 --> 02:10:33.050 align:start position:0%
the IND tax change passes
um

02:10:33.050 --> 02:10:33.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:10:35.770 --> 02:10:35.780 align:start position:0%
what would happen to our Revenue
 
02:10:38.330 --> 02:10:38.340 align:start position:0%
situation as a state
 
02:10:38.340 --> 02:10:40.189 align:start position:0%
situation as a state
so

02:10:40.189 --> 02:10:40.199 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:10:44.570 --> 02:10:44.580 align:start position:0%
I will mention that for business taxes
 
02:10:47.770 --> 02:10:47.780 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:50.930 --> 02:10:50.940 align:start position:0%
for the house for business taxes your
 
02:10:55.250 --> 02:10:55.260 align:start position:0%
growth rate from 24 to 25 was just under
 
02:10:58.189 --> 02:10:58.199 align:start position:0%
minus one percent you anticipated a
 
02:11:00.470 --> 02:11:00.480 align:start position:0%
decline in the tax
 
02:11:04.250 --> 02:11:04.260 align:start position:0%
and then 24 to 25 you anticipated a one
 
02:11:06.649 --> 02:11:06.659 align:start position:0%
and a half percent growth
 
02:11:09.770 --> 02:11:09.780 align:start position:0%
the senate had a one percent growth from
 
02:11:12.470 --> 02:11:12.480 align:start position:0%
23 to 24 and a one percent growth from
 
02:11:14.930 --> 02:11:14.940 align:start position:0%
24 to 25. so the house was a little more
 
02:11:17.149 --> 02:11:17.159 align:start position:0%
pessimistic 23 to 24 and a little more
 
02:11:20.689 --> 02:11:20.699 align:start position:0%
optimistic 24 to 25.
 
02:11:24.649 --> 02:11:24.659 align:start position:0%
for m r you anticipated a one and a half
 
02:11:29.089 --> 02:11:29.099 align:start position:0%
percent growth from 23 to 24 and the
 
02:11:32.330 --> 02:11:32.340 align:start position:0%
Senate anticipated two percent
 
02:11:34.729 --> 02:11:34.739 align:start position:0%
you anticipated two and a half percent
 
02:11:38.209 --> 02:11:38.219 align:start position:0%
from 24 to 25 and the Senate anticipated
 
02:11:40.490 --> 02:11:40.500 align:start position:0%
one and a half so your amounts are
 
02:11:41.750 --> 02:11:41.760 align:start position:0%
almost flipped
 
02:11:44.870 --> 02:11:44.880 align:start position:0%
so I think over the biennium you're
 
02:11:46.669 --> 02:11:46.679 align:start position:0%
fairly consistent in your growth rates
 
02:11:48.229 --> 02:11:48.239 align:start position:0%
just maybe disagree on which year is
 
02:11:50.570 --> 02:11:50.580 align:start position:0%
going to be better than the other okay
 
02:11:53.030 --> 02:11:53.040 align:start position:0%
in terms of the impact IND as Chris
 
02:11:54.890 --> 02:11:54.900 align:start position:0%
mentioned that would show on the Surplus
 
02:11:54.900 --> 02:11:56.390 align:start position:0%
mentioned that would show on the Surplus
statement

02:11:56.390 --> 02:11:56.400 align:start position:0%
statement
 
02:11:57.950 --> 02:11:57.960 align:start position:0%
um and so it would be kind of accounted
 
02:12:00.290 --> 02:12:00.300 align:start position:0%
for after you agree on your Revenue
 
02:12:00.300 --> 02:12:06.770 align:start position:0%
for after you agree on your Revenue
estimates

02:12:06.770 --> 02:12:06.780 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:08.810 --> 02:12:08.820 align:start position:0%
what I think your question might be if
 
02:12:10.729 --> 02:12:10.739 align:start position:0%
your revenues don't come in as forecast
 
02:12:12.350 --> 02:12:12.360 align:start position:0%
what happens
 
02:12:14.750 --> 02:12:14.760 align:start position:0%
and essentially the answer is the
 
02:12:17.510 --> 02:12:17.520 align:start position:0%
expense side would need to be reduced if
 
02:12:20.330 --> 02:12:20.340 align:start position:0%
you did if you budgeted to zero but we
 
02:12:21.709 --> 02:12:21.719 align:start position:0%
don't know that that's going to occur
 
02:12:23.589 --> 02:12:23.599 align:start position:0%
yet there may be um
 
02:12:26.689 --> 02:12:26.699 align:start position:0%
not every dollar will be budgeted right
 
02:12:29.030 --> 02:12:29.040 align:start position:0%
again the Senate you the house didn't
 
02:12:30.410 --> 02:12:30.420 align:start position:0%
budget everything there was some money
 
02:12:33.470 --> 02:12:33.480 align:start position:0%
that was going to go to the rainy day
 
02:12:35.810 --> 02:12:35.820 align:start position:0%
fund the Senate will have a plan that
 
02:12:38.149 --> 02:12:38.159 align:start position:0%
will deposit some money to the rainy day
 
02:12:40.310 --> 02:12:40.320 align:start position:0%
fund so there's a little bit of buffer
 
02:12:42.169 --> 02:12:42.179 align:start position:0%
in the Surplus I don't know what that
 
02:12:45.410 --> 02:12:45.420 align:start position:0%
number will be okay I I think what I'm
 
02:12:47.270 --> 02:12:47.280 align:start position:0%
thinking of is is everyone is kind of
 
02:12:49.189 --> 02:12:49.199 align:start position:0%
thinking through what might happen with
 
02:12:51.950 --> 02:12:51.960 align:start position:0%
the economy and and
 
02:12:54.830 --> 02:12:54.840 align:start position:0%
these numbers
 
02:12:56.930 --> 02:12:56.940 align:start position:0%
um leave a lot of things out right all
 
02:12:59.149 --> 02:12:59.159 align:start position:0%
the expenses are left out and I think
 
02:13:02.990 --> 02:13:03.000 align:start position:0%
the result if these numbers go down more
 
02:13:05.990 --> 02:13:06.000 align:start position:0%
than we expect is that you know more
 
02:13:07.310 --> 02:13:07.320 align:start position:0%
people would be homeless more people
 
02:13:08.990 --> 02:13:09.000 align:start position:0%
would be unemployed more people would
 
02:13:11.030 --> 02:13:11.040 align:start position:0%
need more services so it kind of Demands
 
02:13:14.030 --> 02:13:14.040 align:start position:0%
our expenses go up but if our revenues
 
02:13:16.189 --> 02:13:16.199 align:start position:0%
go down our expenses necessarily go down
 
02:13:18.890 --> 02:13:18.900 align:start position:0%
and I'm not sure again because I'm new
 
02:13:21.950 --> 02:13:21.960 align:start position:0%
how the rainy day fund
 
02:13:24.770 --> 02:13:24.780 align:start position:0%
is drawn on don't we have to have like a
 
02:13:24.780 --> 02:13:25.970 align:start position:0%
is drawn on don't we have to have like a
certain

02:13:25.970 --> 02:13:25.980 align:start position:0%
certain
 
02:13:28.310 --> 02:13:28.320 align:start position:0%
uh need before we can draw on that
 
02:13:30.109 --> 02:13:30.119 align:start position:0%
that's correct
 
02:13:32.270 --> 02:13:32.280 align:start position:0%
so there's a process there's a process
 
02:13:35.450 --> 02:13:35.460 align:start position:0%
that at the end of the biennium if
 
02:13:37.850 --> 02:13:37.860 align:start position:0%
there's a shortage in the revenue
 
02:13:40.910 --> 02:13:40.920 align:start position:0%
compared to your expenses then money can
 
02:13:43.430 --> 02:13:43.440 align:start position:0%
be drawn from the rainy day fund in the
 
02:13:45.649 --> 02:13:45.659 align:start position:0%
interim it would be up to the executive
 
02:13:48.770 --> 02:13:48.780 align:start position:0%
side to manage budgets and to what
 
02:13:50.930 --> 02:13:50.940 align:start position:0%
you've seen are budget reductions in the
 
02:13:52.490 --> 02:13:52.500 align:start position:0%
past when there's been an economic
 
02:13:55.609 --> 02:13:55.619 align:start position:0%
slowdown the governors have had
 
02:13:57.709 --> 02:13:57.719 align:start position:0%
executive orders where they have said to
 
02:13:59.390 --> 02:13:59.400 align:start position:0%
agencies you need to reduce your spend
 
02:14:02.330 --> 02:14:02.340 align:start position:0%
and then they come before fiscal to get
 
02:14:04.370 --> 02:14:04.380 align:start position:0%
that adopted
 
02:14:06.530 --> 02:14:06.540 align:start position:0%
so so there's processes in place to look
 
02:14:08.450 --> 02:14:08.460 align:start position:0%
at that the the executive side will
 
02:14:10.910 --> 02:14:10.920 align:start position:0%
monitor their expenses if revenues
 
02:14:12.530 --> 02:14:12.540 align:start position:0%
aren't coming in
 
02:14:14.510 --> 02:14:14.520 align:start position:0%
um you know at the end of the biennium
 
02:14:16.609 --> 02:14:16.619 align:start position:0%
if there's a negative because revenues
 
02:14:17.569 --> 02:14:17.579 align:start position:0%
weren't there compared to the
 
02:14:19.189 --> 02:14:19.199 align:start position:0%
expenditures and the rainy day fund
 
02:14:23.209 --> 02:14:23.219 align:start position:0%
would be drawn against to pay for that
 
02:14:23.219 --> 02:14:24.790 align:start position:0%
would be drawn against to pay for that
representative

02:14:24.790 --> 02:14:24.800 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:14:27.350 --> 02:14:27.360 align:start position:0%
this has to do with the business profits
 
02:14:29.510 --> 02:14:29.520 align:start position:0%
tax and I'm not going to question the
 
02:14:34.250 --> 02:14:34.260 align:start position:0%
numbers uh necessarily this is a test of
 
02:14:36.410 --> 02:14:36.420 align:start position:0%
how vulnerable we are to changes though
 
02:14:40.030 --> 02:14:40.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:43.010 --> 02:14:43.020 align:start position:0%
are we dependent on business profits tax
 
02:14:45.470 --> 02:14:45.480 align:start position:0%
for a couple of major multinationals
 
02:14:49.250 --> 02:14:49.260 align:start position:0%
creating most of it so let's say a GE
 
02:14:51.470 --> 02:14:51.480 align:start position:0%
falling apart after over the last four
 
02:14:54.169 --> 02:14:54.179 align:start position:0%
years if we had a major one like that if
 
02:14:56.149 --> 02:14:56.159 align:start position:0%
it collapsed how how would we be
 
02:14:56.159 --> 02:14:58.010 align:start position:0%
it collapsed how how would we be
affected

02:14:58.010 --> 02:14:58.020 align:start position:0%
affected
 
02:15:00.109 --> 02:15:00.119 align:start position:0%
so that's a good question
 
02:15:03.410 --> 02:15:03.420 align:start position:0%
um as we've shown in the triangles that
 
02:15:05.149 --> 02:15:05.159 align:start position:0%
we produce
 
02:15:07.609 --> 02:15:07.619 align:start position:0%
um the majority of business tax revenue
 
02:15:10.250 --> 02:15:10.260 align:start position:0%
comes from a few multinational
 
02:15:14.270 --> 02:15:14.280 align:start position:0%
corporations however I will note each
 
02:15:19.129 --> 02:15:19.139 align:start position:0%
year it's not necessarily the same few
 
02:15:22.430 --> 02:15:22.440 align:start position:0%
um so again during we'll use the
 
02:15:25.370 --> 02:15:25.380 align:start position:0%
pandemic as an example the multinational
 
02:15:27.649 --> 02:15:27.659 align:start position:0%
corporations that may have been in the
 
02:15:30.649 --> 02:15:30.659 align:start position:0%
tip of that triangle before the pandemic
 
02:15:33.770 --> 02:15:33.780 align:start position:0%
were not the same corporations in the
 
02:15:35.810 --> 02:15:35.820 align:start position:0%
tip of the triangle during the pandemic
 
02:15:37.550 --> 02:15:37.560 align:start position:0%
because certain industries fared better
 
02:15:39.189 --> 02:15:39.199 align:start position:0%
than others
 
02:15:42.950 --> 02:15:42.960 align:start position:0%
so again it kind of goes back to
 
02:15:42.960 --> 02:15:44.930 align:start position:0%
so again it kind of goes back to
we

02:15:44.930 --> 02:15:44.940 align:start position:0%
we
 
02:15:47.330 --> 02:15:47.340 align:start position:0%
are in an okay place
 
02:15:49.189 --> 02:15:49.199 align:start position:0%
even if there are certain industries
 
02:15:51.709 --> 02:15:51.719 align:start position:0%
that are being impacted by various
 
02:15:55.010 --> 02:15:55.020 align:start position:0%
things where we start to worry is when
 
02:15:57.410 --> 02:15:57.420 align:start position:0%
every industry is feeling the impact of
 
02:16:00.050 --> 02:16:00.060 align:start position:0%
a downturn or a recession if you have an
 
02:16:02.390 --> 02:16:02.400 align:start position:0%
industry like during covid like tourism
 
02:16:05.030 --> 02:16:05.040 align:start position:0%
that was not performing as well but you
 
02:16:06.649 --> 02:16:06.659 align:start position:0%
had another industry like healthcare
 
02:16:08.870 --> 02:16:08.880 align:start position:0%
that was performing well they can kind
 
02:16:11.629 --> 02:16:11.639 align:start position:0%
of offset each other but you are correct
 
02:16:13.910 --> 02:16:13.920 align:start position:0%
that that the
 
02:16:16.790 --> 02:16:16.800 align:start position:0%
that the tip of that triangle tends to
 
02:16:20.089 --> 02:16:20.099 align:start position:0%
be large multinational corporations
 
02:16:23.689 --> 02:16:23.699 align:start position:0%
um and so if they are impacted we could
 
02:16:25.910 --> 02:16:25.920 align:start position:0%
see an impact to that portion of the
 
02:16:25.920 --> 02:16:27.530 align:start position:0%
see an impact to that portion of the
revenue

02:16:27.530 --> 02:16:27.540 align:start position:0%
revenue
 
02:16:30.050 --> 02:16:30.060 align:start position:0%
representative fellows thank you
 
02:16:31.910 --> 02:16:31.920 align:start position:0%
um one of the things that we've seen
 
02:16:34.669 --> 02:16:34.679 align:start position:0%
over the last couple years in terms of
 
02:16:37.669 --> 02:16:37.679 align:start position:0%
inflation has been rental
 
02:16:41.950 --> 02:16:41.960 align:start position:0%
um costs so I assume that
 
02:16:46.009 --> 02:16:46.019 align:start position:0%
landlords pay business profits tax in
 
02:16:47.330 --> 02:16:47.340 align:start position:0%
some cases
 
02:16:51.770 --> 02:16:51.780 align:start position:0%
do you do you see any indication that
 
02:16:56.589 --> 02:16:56.599 align:start position:0%
the rising rental prices are showing
 
02:16:59.209 --> 02:16:59.219 align:start position:0%
additional Revenue coming into the state
 
02:17:00.650 --> 02:17:00.660 align:start position:0%
from that sector
 
02:17:03.469 --> 02:17:03.479 align:start position:0%
we have not analyzed that sector in
 
02:17:03.479 --> 02:17:05.330 align:start position:0%
we have not analyzed that sector in
particular

02:17:05.330 --> 02:17:05.340 align:start position:0%
particular
 
02:17:07.969 --> 02:17:07.979 align:start position:0%
um but it just with any sector to the
 
02:17:10.790 --> 02:17:10.800 align:start position:0%
extent that prices are higher whether
 
02:17:12.950 --> 02:17:12.960 align:start position:0%
it's rent whether it's meals whether
 
02:17:15.230 --> 02:17:15.240 align:start position:0%
it's the price of widgets that you sell
 
02:17:17.570 --> 02:17:17.580 align:start position:0%
to the extent that prices are higher and
 
02:17:20.330 --> 02:17:20.340 align:start position:0%
that is hitting your profits we will see
 
02:17:25.070 --> 02:17:25.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:28.370 --> 02:17:28.380 align:start position:0%
follow-up is it any
 
02:17:33.230 --> 02:17:33.240 align:start position:0%
um income from rental of residential
 
02:17:35.870 --> 02:17:35.880 align:start position:0%
you know Apartments
 
02:17:38.629 --> 02:17:38.639 align:start position:0%
um is that a very big sector at all in
 
02:17:40.250 --> 02:17:40.260 align:start position:0%
terms of the revenues coming from
 
02:17:42.230 --> 02:17:42.240 align:start position:0%
business profits I would say that's not
 
02:17:46.190 --> 02:17:46.200 align:start position:0%
a terribly large sector of the I don't I
 
02:17:48.169 --> 02:17:48.179 align:start position:0%
wouldn't want to venture I guess but I
 
02:17:50.150 --> 02:17:50.160 align:start position:0%
would say it's not
 
02:17:53.810 --> 02:17:53.820 align:start position:0%
a terribly significant industry when you
 
02:17:55.250 --> 02:17:55.260 align:start position:0%
look at all of the business profits
 
02:17:57.709 --> 02:17:57.719 align:start position:0%
taxes representative almi
 
02:18:01.190 --> 02:18:01.200 align:start position:0%
thank you two things
 
02:18:03.770 --> 02:18:03.780 align:start position:0%
sorry the the
 
02:18:07.910 --> 02:18:07.920 align:start position:0%
um if a if large businesses pull out of
 
02:18:10.969 --> 02:18:10.979 align:start position:0%
the state or aren't selling into the
 
02:18:14.870 --> 02:18:14.880 align:start position:0%
state the way we are now on
 
02:18:14.880 --> 02:18:16.150 align:start position:0%
state the way we are now on
it

02:18:16.150 --> 02:18:16.160 align:start position:0%
it
 
02:18:20.810 --> 02:18:20.820 align:start position:0%
affects our the ones that actually were
 
02:18:25.490 --> 02:18:25.500 align:start position:0%
in our state on also do not are not
 
02:18:28.669 --> 02:18:28.679 align:start position:0%
paying as much bet
 
02:18:30.730 --> 02:18:30.740 align:start position:0%
or any bet
 
02:18:34.730 --> 02:18:34.740 align:start position:0%
so we we really have to look at the
 
02:18:39.530 --> 02:18:39.540 align:start position:0%
effect from you too it seems to me on if
 
02:18:43.310 --> 02:18:43.320 align:start position:0%
we get into that kind of position we're
 
02:18:46.730 --> 02:18:46.740 align:start position:0%
losing bet as well as BPT
 
02:18:49.070 --> 02:18:49.080 align:start position:0%
but um
 
02:18:52.549 --> 02:18:52.559 align:start position:0%
I can't remember what the other one she
 
02:18:54.950 --> 02:18:54.960 align:start position:0%
brought up was
 
02:18:57.110 --> 02:18:57.120 align:start position:0%
just met him chair I didn't if we could
 
02:18:59.150 --> 02:18:59.160 align:start position:0%
um finish going through the document
 
02:19:00.830 --> 02:19:00.840 align:start position:0%
just so I can get you to the end of it
 
02:19:02.750 --> 02:19:02.760 align:start position:0%
before I'm assuming you guys are going
 
02:19:04.730 --> 02:19:04.740 align:start position:0%
to try to break it noon but I can keep
 
02:19:07.370 --> 02:19:07.380 align:start position:0%
you longer if you'd like we would love
 
02:19:09.049 --> 02:19:09.059 align:start position:0%
to break at noon and we would love for
 
02:19:11.450 --> 02:19:11.460 align:start position:0%
you to continue your presentation
 
02:19:14.089 --> 02:19:14.099 align:start position:0%
so just to finish up on the first page
 
02:19:16.070 --> 02:19:16.080 align:start position:0%
you had the tobacco settlement was where
 
02:19:18.110 --> 02:19:18.120 align:start position:0%
we left off you'll notice that the
 
02:19:20.990 --> 02:19:21.000 align:start position:0%
amount that came in in April was 44.6
 
02:19:23.810 --> 02:19:23.820 align:start position:0%
Million when you did your estimates the
 
02:19:27.169 --> 02:19:27.179 align:start position:0%
Attorney General at that time thought 42
 
02:19:29.389 --> 02:19:29.399 align:start position:0%
and you'll see that the plan amount was
 
02:19:33.889 --> 02:19:33.899 align:start position:0%
36.3 amount 36.3 million so you can see
 
02:19:35.690 --> 02:19:35.700 align:start position:0%
how volatile that that tobacco
 
02:19:39.049 --> 02:19:39.059 align:start position:0%
settlement Revenue can be so for the out
 
02:19:41.389 --> 02:19:41.399 align:start position:0%
years the the Senate just took the same
 
02:19:44.030 --> 02:19:44.040 align:start position:0%
estimate of 40 million and 38.5 million
 
02:19:46.549 --> 02:19:46.559 align:start position:0%
that was provided by the department
 
02:19:49.490 --> 02:19:49.500 align:start position:0%
the utility property tax the Senate was
 
02:19:53.030 --> 02:19:53.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:55.429 --> 02:19:55.439 align:start position:0%
again it was just some of the um the
 
02:19:57.710 --> 02:19:57.720 align:start position:0%
ranges the bases that were a little bit
 
02:19:57.720 --> 02:19:58.910 align:start position:0%
ranges the bases that were a little bit
lower

02:19:58.910 --> 02:19:58.920 align:start position:0%
lower
 
02:20:00.770 --> 02:20:00.780 align:start position:0%
um as it was presented to the Senate
 
02:20:02.870 --> 02:20:02.880 align:start position:0%
than it was for the house
 
02:20:06.110 --> 02:20:06.120 align:start position:0%
Statewide education property tax the
 
02:20:08.090 --> 02:20:08.100 align:start position:0%
same across the board that's fairly easy
 
02:20:10.370 --> 02:20:10.380 align:start position:0%
straightforward we were hoping for
 
02:20:12.110 --> 02:20:12.120 align:start position:0%
debate but there was none
 
02:20:14.090 --> 02:20:14.100 align:start position:0%
Medicaid recoveries you're going to see
 
02:20:16.610 --> 02:20:16.620 align:start position:0%
an adjustment there the house had 2.6
 
02:20:19.130 --> 02:20:19.140 align:start position:0%
million the Senate came away with 3.4
 
02:20:22.310 --> 02:20:22.320 align:start position:0%
million to date 3.1 million has been
 
02:20:24.670 --> 02:20:24.680 align:start position:0%
collected in recovery so the Senate felt
 
02:20:27.770 --> 02:20:27.780 align:start position:0%
3.4 based on the plan amount was
 
02:20:27.780 --> 02:20:29.870 align:start position:0%
3.4 based on the plan amount was
appropriate

02:20:29.870 --> 02:20:29.880 align:start position:0%
appropriate
 
02:20:32.210 --> 02:20:32.220 align:start position:0%
and then looking at the 10-year
 
02:20:32.220 --> 02:20:32.810 align:start position:0%
and then looking at the 10-year
um

02:20:32.810 --> 02:20:32.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:20:35.230 --> 02:20:35.240 align:start position:0%
Trend that was reported in the AK for
 
02:20:37.429 --> 02:20:37.439 align:start position:0%
the Senate agreed that they should bump
 
02:20:41.510 --> 02:20:41.520 align:start position:0%
it up to 3 million in 24 and 25.
 
02:20:42.830 --> 02:20:42.840 align:start position:0%
and that's why you see the difference
 
02:20:42.840 --> 02:20:43.969 align:start position:0%
and that's why you see the difference
there

02:20:43.969 --> 02:20:43.979 align:start position:0%
there
 
02:20:46.030 --> 02:20:46.040 align:start position:0%
so that gets you to the bottom line that
 
02:20:49.969 --> 02:20:49.979 align:start position:0%
where you see the 63.2 million 66.1 and
 
02:20:51.590 --> 02:20:51.600 align:start position:0%
the 55 million over the three years
 
02:20:54.650 --> 02:20:54.660 align:start position:0%
which is the 184.3 million dollar
 
02:20:54.660 --> 02:20:56.210 align:start position:0%
which is the 184.3 million dollar
increase

02:20:56.210 --> 02:20:56.220 align:start position:0%
increase
 
02:20:57.710 --> 02:20:57.720 align:start position:0%
so again that's your general fund
 
02:20:59.630 --> 02:20:59.640 align:start position:0%
education trust funds we've already gone
 
02:21:01.309 --> 02:21:01.319 align:start position:0%
over the bottom portion which is the
 
02:21:03.110 --> 02:21:03.120 align:start position:0%
changes to proposed changes to current
 
02:21:05.510 --> 02:21:05.520 align:start position:0%
law the Senate hasn't completed that
 
02:21:07.070 --> 02:21:07.080 align:start position:0%
work so there's nothing to show on their
 
02:21:08.870 --> 02:21:08.880 align:start position:0%
side of that you can see what the house
 
02:21:10.429 --> 02:21:10.439 align:start position:0%
had agreed to
 
02:21:13.250 --> 02:21:13.260 align:start position:0%
um on the on the left side if you flip
 
02:21:15.290 --> 02:21:15.300 align:start position:0%
to page two I'm not going to go through
 
02:21:18.110 --> 02:21:18.120 align:start position:0%
every line but I wanted to just point
 
02:21:18.120 --> 02:21:18.889 align:start position:0%
every line but I wanted to just point
out

02:21:18.889 --> 02:21:18.899 align:start position:0%
out
 
02:21:20.570 --> 02:21:20.580 align:start position:0%
uh representative fellow said the
 
02:21:22.490 --> 02:21:22.500 align:start position:0%
question about the the splits for the
 
02:21:24.530 --> 02:21:24.540 align:start position:0%
business tax and the um going to the
 
02:21:26.090 --> 02:21:26.100 align:start position:0%
education trust fund into the general
 
02:21:28.910 --> 02:21:28.920 align:start position:0%
fund and that would be the second and
 
02:21:31.190 --> 02:21:31.200 align:start position:0%
third rows under changes to current law
 
02:21:33.889 --> 02:21:33.899 align:start position:0%
and you'll see the um
 
02:21:35.450 --> 02:21:35.460 align:start position:0%
general fund split for the house was
 
02:21:37.730 --> 02:21:37.740 align:start position:0%
77.5 percent
 
02:21:40.730 --> 02:21:40.740 align:start position:0%
for both those for the bet the
 
02:21:44.210 --> 02:21:44.220 align:start position:0%
governor's proposal had been 65 percent
 
02:21:44.220 --> 02:21:46.010 align:start position:0%
governor's proposal had been 65 percent
yeah

02:21:46.010 --> 02:21:46.020 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
02:21:47.809 --> 02:21:47.819 align:start position:0%
same type of thing on the next page
 
02:21:51.410 --> 02:21:51.420 align:start position:0%
which is the education trust fund
 
02:21:54.770 --> 02:21:54.780 align:start position:0%
again you'll see the um the splits there
 
02:21:57.590 --> 02:21:57.600 align:start position:0%
at the 22 and a half percent again the
 
02:21:59.090 --> 02:21:59.100 align:start position:0%
Senate has made no decision on what they
 
02:22:00.469 --> 02:22:00.479 align:start position:0%
want to do with this aspect of House
 
02:22:03.950 --> 02:22:03.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:09.889 --> 02:22:09.899 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:12.349 --> 02:22:12.359 align:start position:0%
the top part of that is the highway fund
 
02:22:12.359 --> 02:22:13.790 align:start position:0%
the top part of that is the highway fund
estimates

02:22:13.790 --> 02:22:13.800 align:start position:0%
estimates
 
02:22:16.969 --> 02:22:16.979 align:start position:0%
so the road toll was identical for the
 
02:22:19.190 --> 02:22:19.200 align:start position:0%
um house and the Senate there were some
 
02:22:20.809 --> 02:22:20.819 align:start position:0%
slight adjustments in the motor vehicle
 
02:22:22.429 --> 02:22:22.439 align:start position:0%
fees presented by the department of
 
02:22:24.710 --> 02:22:24.720 align:start position:0%
safety and that's what you see
 
02:22:27.770 --> 02:22:27.780 align:start position:0%
um a 0.3 increase in fiscal year 23 and
 
02:22:29.990 --> 02:22:30.000 align:start position:0%
then a 1.2 million dollar increase in 24
 
02:22:32.270 --> 02:22:32.280 align:start position:0%
and 25.
 
02:22:34.130 --> 02:22:34.140 align:start position:0%
um and then for the miscellaneous it
 
02:22:36.410 --> 02:22:36.420 align:start position:0%
stayed at 200 000.
 
02:22:38.870 --> 02:22:38.880 align:start position:0%
and again the miscellaneous is um
 
02:22:40.670 --> 02:22:40.680 align:start position:0%
Revenue that's generated by the
 
02:22:42.349 --> 02:22:42.359 align:start position:0%
Department of Transportation
 
02:22:44.650 --> 02:22:44.660 align:start position:0%
mainly through the sale of surplus
 
02:22:48.410 --> 02:22:48.420 align:start position:0%
buildings and um equipment
 
02:22:52.190 --> 02:22:52.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:53.570 --> 02:22:53.580 align:start position:0%
so if there's no questions on the
 
02:22:55.429 --> 02:22:55.439 align:start position:0%
highway fund I'll bump you down to the
 
02:22:59.090 --> 02:22:59.100 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:00.770 --> 02:23:00.780 align:start position:0%
again there was no changes to the
 
02:23:03.349 --> 02:23:03.359 align:start position:0%
licenses the 9.8 million in all three
 
02:23:05.510 --> 02:23:05.520 align:start position:0%
years for both the house and the Senate
 
02:23:07.309 --> 02:23:07.319 align:start position:0%
there were some adjustments in the other
 
02:23:07.319 --> 02:23:09.349 align:start position:0%
there were some adjustments in the other
Revenue

02:23:09.349 --> 02:23:09.359 align:start position:0%
Revenue
 
02:23:11.809 --> 02:23:11.819 align:start position:0%
one of the um one of the adjustments
 
02:23:14.750 --> 02:23:14.760 align:start position:0%
related to interest Revenue the fish and
 
02:23:16.370 --> 02:23:16.380 align:start position:0%
game fund
 
02:23:19.429 --> 02:23:19.439 align:start position:0%
um is allocated Revenue when the
 
02:23:23.630 --> 02:23:23.640 align:start position:0%
treasurer is able to gather that so not
 
02:23:25.969 --> 02:23:25.979 align:start position:0%
all funds are portioned out a piece of
 
02:23:27.950 --> 02:23:27.960 align:start position:0%
the interest when they get that it will
 
02:23:30.349 --> 02:23:30.359 align:start position:0%
go typically to the general fund however
 
02:23:32.510 --> 02:23:32.520 align:start position:0%
the fishing game fund has been seen
 
02:23:34.309 --> 02:23:34.319 align:start position:0%
about forty thousand dollars a month in
 
02:23:37.250 --> 02:23:37.260 align:start position:0%
Revenue related to the interest so the
 
02:23:39.770 --> 02:23:39.780 align:start position:0%
Senate um accounted for that in the
 
02:23:44.150 --> 02:23:44.160 align:start position:0%
three years as well as in the um
 
02:23:47.990 --> 02:23:48.000 align:start position:0%
24 and 25 the fish and game department
 
02:23:48.000 --> 02:23:49.429 align:start position:0%
24 and 25 the fish and game department
had

02:23:49.429 --> 02:23:49.439 align:start position:0%
had
 
02:23:52.190 --> 02:23:52.200 align:start position:0%
its unrefunded road toll and unrefunded
 
02:23:53.990 --> 02:23:54.000 align:start position:0%
Marine road tolls
 
02:23:54.000 --> 02:23:55.130 align:start position:0%
Marine road tolls
um

02:23:55.130 --> 02:23:55.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:23:57.770 --> 02:23:57.780 align:start position:0%
we're at a flat level of 800 900
 
02:23:59.690 --> 02:23:59.700 align:start position:0%
respectively but in the last few years
 
02:24:01.010 --> 02:24:01.020 align:start position:0%
they've been collecting a million
 
02:24:02.750 --> 02:24:02.760 align:start position:0%
million one
 
02:24:05.450 --> 02:24:05.460 align:start position:0%
um when questioned the department agreed
 
02:24:06.889 --> 02:24:06.899 align:start position:0%
to bump each of those up by a hundred
 
02:24:08.330 --> 02:24:08.340 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars
 
02:24:09.950 --> 02:24:09.960 align:start position:0%
so it was a two hundred thousand dollar
 
02:24:11.690 --> 02:24:11.700 align:start position:0%
bump up in each year related to those
 
02:24:13.610 --> 02:24:13.620 align:start position:0%
unrefunded road tolls so that's the
 
02:24:16.190 --> 02:24:16.200 align:start position:0%
difference in the fishing game area
 
02:24:17.750 --> 02:24:17.760 align:start position:0%
so I just wanted to make sure we got to
 
02:24:17.760 --> 02:24:20.150 align:start position:0%
so I just wanted to make sure we got to
that

02:24:20.150 --> 02:24:20.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:22.190 --> 02:24:22.200 align:start position:0%
the last document which I won't go
 
02:24:24.530 --> 02:24:24.540 align:start position:0%
through but it is the worksheet
 
02:24:24.540 --> 02:24:25.429 align:start position:0%
through but it is the worksheet
um

02:24:25.429 --> 02:24:25.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:24:28.130 --> 02:24:28.140 align:start position:0%
I think the benefit of that if if you're
 
02:24:29.889 --> 02:24:29.899 align:start position:0%
interested is if you flip the page four
 
02:24:32.870 --> 02:24:32.880 align:start position:0%
you can see what revenues were in fiscal
 
02:24:35.330 --> 02:24:35.340 align:start position:0%
year 22. you can see what was the plan
 
02:24:38.450 --> 02:24:38.460 align:start position:0%
versus what was actually collected then
 
02:24:40.790 --> 02:24:40.800 align:start position:0%
you can see what the plan is for fiscal
 
02:24:43.429 --> 02:24:43.439 align:start position:0%
year 23 and then you can see what the
 
02:24:43.439 --> 02:24:44.809 align:start position:0%
year 23 and then you can see what the
governor

02:24:44.809 --> 02:24:44.819 align:start position:0%
governor
 
02:24:46.370 --> 02:24:46.380 align:start position:0%
the house
 
02:24:48.710 --> 02:24:48.720 align:start position:0%
what the agencies high and lows were for
 
02:24:50.150 --> 02:24:50.160 align:start position:0%
the Senate and then what the Senate
 
02:24:52.010 --> 02:24:52.020 align:start position:0%
estimates are so it kind of gives you a
 
02:24:53.929 --> 02:24:53.939 align:start position:0%
One-Shot look at you know the various
 
02:24:58.730 --> 02:24:58.740 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:00.230 --> 02:25:00.240 align:start position:0%
so again I won't go through all that
 
02:25:02.030 --> 02:25:02.040 align:start position:0%
because it's really summarized you know
 
02:25:04.730 --> 02:25:04.740 align:start position:0%
on the sheet we just went through
 
02:25:06.469 --> 02:25:06.479 align:start position:0%
I think that again the reason that uh
 
02:25:08.330 --> 02:25:08.340 align:start position:0%
the chair invited us here today was to
 
02:25:09.469 --> 02:25:09.479 align:start position:0%
kind of go through what the Senate
 
02:25:11.570 --> 02:25:11.580 align:start position:0%
provided to give you some information as
 
02:25:13.250 --> 02:25:13.260 align:start position:0%
the for the committee so as you think
 
02:25:13.260 --> 02:25:14.630 align:start position:0%
the for the committee so as you think
about

02:25:14.630 --> 02:25:14.640 align:start position:0%
about
 
02:25:16.849 --> 02:25:16.859 align:start position:0%
um going forward if there is a committee
 
02:25:18.950 --> 02:25:18.960 align:start position:0%
a conference or some other action that
 
02:25:20.510 --> 02:25:20.520 align:start position:0%
might be needed in terms of revenues you
 
02:25:22.670 --> 02:25:22.680 align:start position:0%
at least have some Base information to
 
02:25:25.910 --> 02:25:25.920 align:start position:0%
go by all the documents that the
 
02:25:28.610 --> 02:25:28.620 align:start position:0%
agencies provided are on our website for
 
02:25:31.250 --> 02:25:31.260 align:start position:0%
both the house and the Senate
 
02:25:34.849 --> 02:25:34.859 align:start position:0%
um all the agency presentations were
 
02:25:36.650 --> 02:25:36.660 align:start position:0%
streamed on the YouTube so if you went
 
02:25:38.750 --> 02:25:38.760 align:start position:0%
to the Senate ways and means you'd be
 
02:25:40.490 --> 02:25:40.500 align:start position:0%
able to watch certain agencies if you
 
02:25:44.090 --> 02:25:44.100 align:start position:0%
wanted to hear what they testified to
 
02:25:46.190 --> 02:25:46.200 align:start position:0%
um so happy to answer any additional
 
02:25:48.590 --> 02:25:48.600 align:start position:0%
questions or go over anything but just
 
02:25:49.910 --> 02:25:49.920 align:start position:0%
wanted to make sure we got you to the
 
02:25:51.410 --> 02:25:51.420 align:start position:0%
end because sometimes we miss the
 
02:25:54.950 --> 02:25:54.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:57.349 --> 02:25:57.359 align:start position:0%
thank you so much representative Platt I
 
02:25:59.150 --> 02:25:59.160 align:start position:0%
just wanted to say thank you for the
 
02:26:01.370 --> 02:26:01.380 align:start position:0%
presentations and all the hard work you
 
02:26:03.770 --> 02:26:03.780 align:start position:0%
do to give the House and Senate some
 
02:26:08.290 --> 02:26:08.300 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:11.510 --> 02:26:11.520 align:start position:0%
representative Army yes and we haven't
 
02:26:13.190 --> 02:26:13.200 align:start position:0%
gone through
 
02:26:17.330 --> 02:26:17.340 align:start position:0%
the gra presentation but since it's very
 
02:26:20.090 --> 02:26:20.100 align:start position:0%
similar to the one that we had before we
 
02:26:21.830 --> 02:26:21.840 align:start position:0%
can probably handle it on our own
 
02:26:23.510 --> 02:26:23.520 align:start position:0%
correct that is
 
02:26:25.250 --> 02:26:25.260 align:start position:0%
um the dra presentation that's in front
 
02:26:27.349 --> 02:26:27.359 align:start position:0%
of you that is what we presented to the
 
02:26:29.990 --> 02:26:30.000 align:start position:0%
Senate it looks just like the
 
02:26:32.809 --> 02:26:32.819 align:start position:0%
presentation we gave to you the only
 
02:26:35.750 --> 02:26:35.760 align:start position:0%
thing that changed was the high and low
 
02:26:39.110 --> 02:26:39.120 align:start position:0%
estimates for fiscal 23. so the only
 
02:26:40.730 --> 02:26:40.740 align:start position:0%
thing as Chris already mentioned that
 
02:26:42.349 --> 02:26:42.359 align:start position:0%
changed in that presentation was the
 
02:26:44.630 --> 02:26:44.640 align:start position:0%
high and low estimates for fiscal 23 the
 
02:26:47.349 --> 02:26:47.359 align:start position:0%
growth rates for 24 and 25 for every tax
 
02:26:50.030 --> 02:26:50.040 align:start position:0%
remained the same
 
02:26:52.309 --> 02:26:52.319 align:start position:0%
and Chris has also summarized that
 
02:26:54.950 --> 02:26:54.960 align:start position:0%
presentation within his
 
02:26:57.410 --> 02:26:57.420 align:start position:0%
um worksheets as well but if you wanted
 
02:26:57.420 --> 02:26:58.490 align:start position:0%
um worksheets as well but if you wanted
to

02:26:58.490 --> 02:26:58.500 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:27:00.950 --> 02:27:00.960 align:start position:0%
I had trouble sleeping and you wanted to
 
02:27:04.309 --> 02:27:04.319 align:start position:0%
look at something that might help
 
02:27:06.530 --> 02:27:06.540 align:start position:0%
and the reason why you changed your
 
02:27:08.570 --> 02:27:08.580 align:start position:0%
range is because the actual revenue is
 
02:27:11.150 --> 02:27:11.160 align:start position:0%
coming in in March and April were higher
 
02:27:13.309 --> 02:27:13.319 align:start position:0%
exactly that's a great point so we go
 
02:27:15.230 --> 02:27:15.240 align:start position:0%
through the same exercise for the Senate
 
02:27:17.690 --> 02:27:17.700 align:start position:0%
as we did for you we look at
 
02:27:20.630 --> 02:27:20.640 align:start position:0%
year-to-date revenues we run a few
 
02:27:23.690 --> 02:27:23.700 align:start position:0%
different scenarios to estimate out the
 
02:27:25.670 --> 02:27:25.680 align:start position:0%
remainder of the year and then we
 
02:27:27.410 --> 02:27:27.420 align:start position:0%
analyze those scenarios to see which
 
02:27:28.670 --> 02:27:28.680 align:start position:0%
ones we think are actually the most
 
02:27:30.770 --> 02:27:30.780 align:start position:0%
likely to happen and then we present
 
02:27:33.530 --> 02:27:33.540 align:start position:0%
those as our high and low ranges so yes
 
02:27:35.690 --> 02:27:35.700 align:start position:0%
it's just an update to year-to-date
 
02:27:39.469 --> 02:27:39.479 align:start position:0%
revenue and then running the scenarios
 
02:27:41.870 --> 02:27:41.880 align:start position:0%
thank you very much any other questions
 
02:27:43.790 --> 02:27:43.800 align:start position:0%
comments discussion yes representative
 
02:27:48.770 --> 02:27:48.780 align:start position:0%
Olney I'd I'd asked about the bank
 
02:27:48.780 --> 02:27:50.830 align:start position:0%
Olney I'd I'd asked about the bank
account

02:27:50.830 --> 02:27:50.840 align:start position:0%
account
 
02:27:55.550 --> 02:27:55.560 align:start position:0%
on analysis the FED does but
 
02:27:57.530 --> 02:27:57.540 align:start position:0%
um we might be able to get a little bit
 
02:28:00.710 --> 02:28:00.720 align:start position:0%
more up-to-date material on what's
 
02:28:05.450 --> 02:28:05.460 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:09.410 --> 02:28:09.420 align:start position:0%
and it'd be useful I think to get an
 
02:28:12.650 --> 02:28:12.660 align:start position:0%
idea about how nervous we are about the
 
02:28:12.660 --> 02:28:14.809 align:start position:0%
idea about how nervous we are about the
recession

02:28:14.809 --> 02:28:14.819 align:start position:0%
recession
 
02:28:16.969 --> 02:28:16.979 align:start position:0%
which is the big question that none of
 
02:28:18.950 --> 02:28:18.960 align:start position:0%
us can answer
 
02:28:20.929 --> 02:28:20.939 align:start position:0%
and I've been talking about for eight
 
02:28:23.210 --> 02:28:23.220 align:start position:0%
years I think it is now so so
 
02:28:25.370 --> 02:28:25.380 align:start position:0%
representative Almy are you asking the
 
02:28:26.990 --> 02:28:27.000 align:start position:0%
commissioner to come back to us with
 
02:28:29.630 --> 02:28:29.640 align:start position:0%
that if that's or to send it to us yeah
 
02:28:31.849 --> 02:28:31.859 align:start position:0%
if you have any articles or information
 
02:28:34.910 --> 02:28:34.920 align:start position:0%
that you could share that'd be helpful
 
02:28:36.410 --> 02:28:36.420 align:start position:0%
um at this point we probably wouldn't
 
02:28:38.650 --> 02:28:38.660 align:start position:0%
invite any outside speakers
 
02:28:40.670 --> 02:28:40.680 align:start position:0%
this is something we want to keep our
 
02:28:43.429 --> 02:28:43.439 align:start position:0%
eye on obviously especially when the
 
02:28:45.170 --> 02:28:45.180 align:start position:0%
budget comes back to us we get to see
 
02:28:47.210 --> 02:28:47.220 align:start position:0%
that uh
 
02:28:48.830 --> 02:28:48.840 align:start position:0%
I thought of another question
 
02:28:51.170 --> 02:28:51.180 align:start position:0%
any other questions from the committee
 
02:28:51.180 --> 02:28:52.429 align:start position:0%
any other questions from the committee
yep

02:28:52.429 --> 02:28:52.439 align:start position:0%
yep
 
02:28:55.790 --> 02:28:55.800 align:start position:0%
so once the Senate finishes up um
 
02:28:57.469 --> 02:28:57.479 align:start position:0%
the budget side of it and we know what's
 
02:28:59.990 --> 02:29:00.000 align:start position:0%
in house bill 2. I'll update the long
 
02:29:01.730 --> 02:29:01.740 align:start position:0%
sheets so you'll see on the bottom what
 
02:29:04.010 --> 02:29:04.020 align:start position:0%
the proposed current Law changes are so
 
02:29:06.770 --> 02:29:06.780 align:start position:0%
you'll get an email at some point
 
02:29:08.570 --> 02:29:08.580 align:start position:0%
um probably at the beginning of June
 
02:29:10.910 --> 02:29:10.920 align:start position:0%
that would tell you what the changes are
 
02:29:14.090 --> 02:29:14.100 align:start position:0%
that they're proposing to the taxes or
 
02:29:16.190 --> 02:29:16.200 align:start position:0%
other Revenue impacts the other question
 
02:29:18.410 --> 02:29:18.420 align:start position:0%
I had was when would you have a good
 
02:29:23.750 --> 02:29:23.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:26.510 --> 02:29:26.520 align:start position:0%
very early June well we will have those
 
02:29:28.969 --> 02:29:28.979 align:start position:0%
May doesn't tend to be a large Revenue
 
02:29:28.979 --> 02:29:30.469 align:start position:0%
May doesn't tend to be a large Revenue
month

02:29:30.469 --> 02:29:30.479 align:start position:0%
month
 
02:29:32.330 --> 02:29:32.340 align:start position:0%
um it's actually one of the lowest out
 
02:29:34.730 --> 02:29:34.740 align:start position:0%
of the whole year June is the next month
 
02:29:36.830 --> 02:29:36.840 align:start position:0%
unfortunately that we see the largest
 
02:29:38.929 --> 02:29:38.939 align:start position:0%
amount of Revenue coming in
 
02:29:41.090 --> 02:29:41.100 align:start position:0%
um so you'll get the revenue Focus like
 
02:29:43.730 --> 02:29:43.740 align:start position:0%
you always do at the beginning of of
 
02:29:46.429 --> 02:29:46.439 align:start position:0%
June for the month of May you get our
 
02:29:48.710 --> 02:29:48.720 align:start position:0%
daily reports that we send out but I'll
 
02:29:50.750 --> 02:29:50.760 align:start position:0%
make sure to mention or send a separate
 
02:29:53.630 --> 02:29:53.640 align:start position:0%
email if there's anything indicative or
 
02:29:54.830 --> 02:29:54.840 align:start position:0%
anomalous or anything in the May
 
02:29:56.030 --> 02:29:56.040 align:start position:0%
revenues that I think you should pay
 
02:29:58.370 --> 02:29:58.380 align:start position:0%
attention to but otherwise it should
 
02:30:00.110 --> 02:30:00.120 align:start position:0%
just be a pretty standard month but I'll
 
02:30:02.150 --> 02:30:02.160 align:start position:0%
flag anything if it if I see it
 
02:30:04.849 --> 02:30:04.859 align:start position:0%
representative Phyllis um yes um because
 
02:30:06.469 --> 02:30:06.479 align:start position:0%
my printer
 
02:30:08.450 --> 02:30:08.460 align:start position:0%
won't do these
 
02:30:11.270 --> 02:30:11.280 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering wondering since since my
 
02:30:13.370 --> 02:30:13.380 align:start position:0%
printer won't at home won't do these is
 
02:30:17.150 --> 02:30:17.160 align:start position:0%
where can we pick one up maybe
 
02:30:20.150 --> 02:30:20.160 align:start position:0%
when you do the new ones oh you just let
 
02:30:21.770 --> 02:30:21.780 align:start position:0%
me know if you need a hard copy and I'll
 
02:30:23.389 --> 02:30:23.399 align:start position:0%
make it available at the office okay
 
02:30:27.650 --> 02:30:27.660 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:30.530 --> 02:30:30.540 align:start position:0%
okay great thank you so much we really
 
02:30:33.590 --> 02:30:33.600 align:start position:0%
appreciate the update and uh folks a
 
02:30:35.990 --> 02:30:36.000 align:start position:0%
friendly reminder that this Thursday is
 
02:30:37.849 --> 02:30:37.859 align:start position:0%
a session so we'll see you all there
 
02:30:42.770 --> 02:30:42.780 align:start position:0%
starts at 10. and then plan on at the
 
02:30:44.929 --> 02:30:44.939 align:start position:0%
moment plan on next Tuesday and then the
 
02:30:46.610 --> 02:30:46.620 align:start position:0%
following Tuesday that will come back
 
02:30:48.170 --> 02:30:48.180 align:start position:0%
and do more work
 
02:30:49.670 --> 02:30:49.680 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:30:51.950 --> 02:30:51.960 align:start position:0%
somewhere around the 9 30 or 10 I I did
 
02:30:53.150 --> 02:30:53.160 align:start position:0%
it a little earlier than I expected
 
02:30:54.290 --> 02:30:54.300 align:start position:0%
today because I wanted to make sure we
 
02:30:56.630 --> 02:30:56.640 align:start position:0%
left enough time for them so
