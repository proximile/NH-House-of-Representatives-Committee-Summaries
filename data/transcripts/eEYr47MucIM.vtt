the senate went to conference committee
 
00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:14.240 align:start position:0%
and the governor veto bill
 
00:07:16.070 --> 00:07:16.080 align:start position:0%
i will discuss that in a little bit here
 
00:07:17.589 --> 00:07:17.599 align:start position:0%
i would say that the bill that you have
 
00:07:19.830 --> 00:07:19.840 align:start position:0%
before you is the bill that came out of
 
00:07:21.670 --> 00:07:21.680 align:start position:0%
conference committee uh it was
 
00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:24.560 align:start position:0%
negotiated uh in a bipartisan way
 
00:07:27.430 --> 00:07:27.440 align:start position:0%
and also with uh the lobbyists involved
 
00:07:29.270 --> 00:07:29.280 align:start position:0%
in the discussions that went on during
 
00:07:31.029 --> 00:07:31.039 align:start position:0%
conference committee as well
 
00:07:33.350 --> 00:07:33.360 align:start position:0%
so what you have here is a bill that is
 
00:07:34.550 --> 00:07:34.560 align:start position:0%
pretty much
 
00:07:36.790 --> 00:07:36.800 align:start position:0%
a very simple build
 
00:07:39.350 --> 00:07:39.360 align:start position:0%
how we define prime weapons
 
00:07:40.870 --> 00:07:40.880 align:start position:0%
prime wetland says
 
00:07:42.230 --> 00:07:42.240 align:start position:0%
relatively this is relatively
 
00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:43.589 align:start position:0%
relatively this is relatively
insignificant

00:07:43.589 --> 00:07:43.599 align:start position:0%
insignificant
 
00:07:46.150 --> 00:07:46.160 align:start position:0%
right now you have about 32 33
 
00:07:48.230 --> 00:07:48.240 align:start position:0%
communities who have prime weapons that
 
00:07:50.790 --> 00:07:50.800 align:start position:0%
they've identified in the in the state
 
00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:51.589 align:start position:0%
they've identified in the in the state
and

00:07:51.589 --> 00:07:51.599 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:07:53.270 --> 00:07:53.280 align:start position:0%
we have a couple more that would like to
 
00:07:54.230 --> 00:07:54.240 align:start position:0%
do this
 
00:07:55.670 --> 00:07:55.680 align:start position:0%
but because of the changes that were
 
00:07:58.469 --> 00:07:58.479 align:start position:0%
made back in 2012 they have uh they have
 
00:07:59.830 --> 00:07:59.840 align:start position:0%
not gone forward with their prime
 
00:08:01.670 --> 00:08:01.680 align:start position:0%
weapons definitions let me give you a
 
00:08:03.749 --> 00:08:03.759 align:start position:0%
little bit of history prime wilkins was
 
00:08:06.230 --> 00:08:06.240 align:start position:0%
basically i was originally adopted in
 
00:08:09.670 --> 00:08:09.680 align:start position:0%
1990 1979 i was actually a member of the
 
00:08:11.189 --> 00:08:11.199 align:start position:0%
house back then
 
00:08:11.199 --> 00:08:12.550 align:start position:0%
house back then
um

00:08:12.550 --> 00:08:12.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:13.749 align:start position:0%
um
in

00:08:13.749 --> 00:08:13.759 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:08:16.629 --> 00:08:16.639 align:start position:0%
august 24th of 007
 
00:08:19.189 --> 00:08:19.199 align:start position:0%
there was a 100-foot buffer
 
00:08:21.430 --> 00:08:21.440 align:start position:0%
that was added to the bill which
 
00:08:23.749 --> 00:08:23.759 align:start position:0%
required there to be a 100-foot setback
 
00:08:28.150 --> 00:08:28.160 align:start position:0%
from any prime weapons in 2009
 
00:08:31.110 --> 00:08:31.120 align:start position:0%
um it was also required that any
 
00:08:32.949 --> 00:08:32.959 align:start position:0%
activity within the prime weapons or
 
00:08:35.430 --> 00:08:35.440 align:start position:0%
within 100 foot buffer communities would
 
00:08:37.909 --> 00:08:37.919 align:start position:0%
have to be noticed
 
00:08:40.070 --> 00:08:40.080 align:start position:0%
prior to any work being done and they
 
00:08:41.990 --> 00:08:42.000 align:start position:0%
were given a 20-day window basically to
 
00:08:44.149 --> 00:08:44.159 align:start position:0%
look at what went on in the prime
 
00:08:44.159 --> 00:08:45.430 align:start position:0%
look at what went on in the prime
weapons

00:08:45.430 --> 00:08:45.440 align:start position:0%
weapons
 
00:08:48.310 --> 00:08:48.320 align:start position:0%
in august of 2012
 
00:08:50.070 --> 00:08:50.080 align:start position:0%
the 100-foot buffer
 
00:08:53.350 --> 00:08:53.360 align:start position:0%
and this 50-foot width was repealed
 
00:08:56.630 --> 00:08:56.640 align:start position:0%
prior to 2012 this 50-foot width existed
 
00:08:59.829 --> 00:08:59.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:02.150 --> 00:09:02.160 align:start position:0%
the re the rules as they currently state
 
00:09:03.590 --> 00:09:03.600 align:start position:0%
and the way the legislation was written
 
00:09:05.750 --> 00:09:05.760 align:start position:0%
back in 2012
 
00:09:08.070 --> 00:09:08.080 align:start position:0%
said that any parcels approved between
 
00:09:12.550 --> 00:09:12.560 align:start position:0%
the dates of 2009 and 2012 would
 
00:09:14.310 --> 00:09:14.320 align:start position:0%
continue to have that hundred foot
 
00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:15.670 align:start position:0%
continue to have that hundred foot
buffer

00:09:15.670 --> 00:09:15.680 align:start position:0%
buffer
 
00:09:17.509 --> 00:09:17.519 align:start position:0%
which is quite unusual usually if we
 
00:09:18.550 --> 00:09:18.560 align:start position:0%
take something away we would take it
 
00:09:20.630 --> 00:09:20.640 align:start position:0%
away from everybody but in this case any
 
00:09:22.630 --> 00:09:22.640 align:start position:0%
of those towns that approved it it would
 
00:09:24.470 --> 00:09:24.480 align:start position:0%
have 100 foot buffer and they would also
 
00:09:27.829 --> 00:09:27.839 align:start position:0%
include the areas that had 50 foot width
 
00:09:29.509 --> 00:09:29.519 align:start position:0%
requirement but this is going to say
 
00:09:31.110 --> 00:09:31.120 align:start position:0%
what the bill does is
 
00:09:32.870 --> 00:09:32.880 align:start position:0%
is basically says currently if you have
 
00:09:35.750 --> 00:09:35.760 align:start position:0%
areas that are less than 50 foot wide
 
00:09:37.509 --> 00:09:37.519 align:start position:0%
and we have other people
 
00:09:39.030 --> 00:09:39.040 align:start position:0%
rick van de polis here who will be able
 
00:09:40.630 --> 00:09:40.640 align:start position:0%
to explain that a little bit more the
 
00:09:42.710 --> 00:09:42.720 align:start position:0%
geometry around it a little bit more
 
00:09:44.710 --> 00:09:44.720 align:start position:0%
than i can but
 
00:09:46.630 --> 00:09:46.640 align:start position:0%
what it did was is
 
00:09:49.030 --> 00:09:49.040 align:start position:0%
prior to 2012
 
00:09:51.350 --> 00:09:51.360 align:start position:0%
those areas could be included as long as
 
00:09:52.550 --> 00:09:52.560 align:start position:0%
they met the requirements of the
 
00:09:54.630 --> 00:09:54.640 align:start position:0%
legislation there are some details that
 
00:09:56.710 --> 00:09:56.720 align:start position:0%
i'll i'll get into in just a minute
 
00:09:59.190 --> 00:09:59.200 align:start position:0%
after 2012 it took out those smaller
 
00:10:01.350 --> 00:10:01.360 align:start position:0%
areas they may be just as important but
 
00:10:03.350 --> 00:10:03.360 align:start position:0%
it did not provide protection for those
 
00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:05.030 align:start position:0%
it did not provide protection for those
things

00:10:05.030 --> 00:10:05.040 align:start position:0%
things
 
00:10:06.710 --> 00:10:06.720 align:start position:0%
you're going to see maps
 
00:10:08.710 --> 00:10:08.720 align:start position:0%
in fact we all received in the mail map
 
00:10:12.710 --> 00:10:12.720 align:start position:0%
show two weapons and a long skinny line
 
00:10:15.030 --> 00:10:15.040 align:start position:0%
between them
 
00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:16.069 align:start position:0%
between them
this

00:10:16.069 --> 00:10:16.079 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:10:18.310 --> 00:10:18.320 align:start position:0%
i mean yeah it may be that this long
 
00:10:21.509 --> 00:10:21.519 align:start position:0%
skinny line maybe a stream it may be a
 
00:10:21.519 --> 00:10:22.630 align:start position:0%
skinny line maybe a stream it may be a
weapon

00:10:22.630 --> 00:10:22.640 align:start position:0%
weapon
 
00:10:24.630 --> 00:10:24.640 align:start position:0%
it's less than 50 foot wide
 
00:10:26.630 --> 00:10:26.640 align:start position:0%
and the opponents to the bill are saying
 
00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:27.829 align:start position:0%
and the opponents to the bill are saying
that

00:10:27.829 --> 00:10:27.839 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:10:29.350 --> 00:10:29.360 align:start position:0%
this is
 
00:10:30.870 --> 00:10:30.880 align:start position:0%
a problem that they can't have this
 
00:10:33.509 --> 00:10:33.519 align:start position:0%
could be a mile long that's relevant
 
00:10:36.949 --> 00:10:36.959 align:start position:0%
well there's not a lot of sense to this
 
00:10:39.110 --> 00:10:39.120 align:start position:0%
in order to be a prime woman there are
 
00:10:40.790 --> 00:10:40.800 align:start position:0%
12 requirements
 
00:10:42.069 --> 00:10:42.079 align:start position:0%
that they have to look you have to meet
 
00:10:45.110 --> 00:10:45.120 align:start position:0%
four of 12 requirements one
 
00:10:47.910 --> 00:10:47.920 align:start position:0%
that it might that has to be
 
00:10:49.670 --> 00:10:49.680 align:start position:0%
a wildlife habitat
 
00:10:51.670 --> 00:10:51.680 align:start position:0%
it must be dependent on a wildlife
 
00:10:51.680 --> 00:10:52.790 align:start position:0%
it must be dependent on a wildlife
habitat

00:10:52.790 --> 00:10:52.800 align:start position:0%
habitat
 
00:10:54.790 --> 00:10:54.800 align:start position:0%
and then there are 11 other criteria
 
00:10:56.790 --> 00:10:56.800 align:start position:0%
that it has to meet as well one is
 
00:10:59.430 --> 00:10:59.440 align:start position:0%
ecological integrity
 
00:11:01.990 --> 00:11:02.000 align:start position:0%
possibly efficient aquatic life habitat
 
00:11:04.230 --> 00:11:04.240 align:start position:0%
is this a good fishing area as well
 
00:11:07.190 --> 00:11:07.200 align:start position:0%
scenic quality of that of that wetland
 
00:11:09.750 --> 00:11:09.760 align:start position:0%
educational potential
 
00:11:11.990 --> 00:11:12.000 align:start position:0%
wetlands-based recreation we're going to
 
00:11:13.430 --> 00:11:13.440 align:start position:0%
be dealing with some of that in the hoyt
 
00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:14.790 align:start position:0%
be dealing with some of that in the hoyt
pawn

00:11:14.790 --> 00:11:14.800 align:start position:0%
pawn
 
00:11:16.949 --> 00:11:16.959 align:start position:0%
bill that's coming up later
 
00:11:18.870 --> 00:11:18.880 align:start position:0%
blood storage this is something that's
 
00:11:20.550 --> 00:11:20.560 align:start position:0%
very important for a lot of communities
 
00:11:21.509 --> 00:11:21.519 align:start position:0%
and some of the communities that are
 
00:11:24.470 --> 00:11:24.480 align:start position:0%
looking at doing this in the future
 
00:11:25.990 --> 00:11:26.000 align:start position:0%
they're looking at it a lot a lot of
 
00:11:27.910 --> 00:11:27.920 align:start position:0%
what they have is it has the wildlife
 
00:11:30.150 --> 00:11:30.160 align:start position:0%
habitat and it also is something that's
 
00:11:32.069 --> 00:11:32.079 align:start position:0%
very important for flood storage and
 
00:11:34.310 --> 00:11:34.320 align:start position:0%
that's very costly for both the state
 
00:11:36.630 --> 00:11:36.640 align:start position:0%
and the local communities groundwater
 
00:11:38.630 --> 00:11:38.640 align:start position:0%
recharge and the purification of
 
00:11:40.389 --> 00:11:40.399 align:start position:0%
groundwater this is something that's
 
00:11:41.910 --> 00:11:41.920 align:start position:0%
very very important for communities as
 
00:11:43.990 --> 00:11:44.000 align:start position:0%
well when we're looking at efas and
 
00:11:45.269 --> 00:11:45.279 align:start position:0%
other types of contaminants in our
 
00:11:47.430 --> 00:11:47.440 align:start position:0%
groundwater wetlands have been found to
 
00:11:49.509 --> 00:11:49.519 align:start position:0%
be the most successful way to treat the
 
00:11:51.190 --> 00:11:51.200 align:start position:0%
eminence before it gets into the
 
00:11:53.030 --> 00:11:53.040 align:start position:0%
groundwater and our drinking water
 
00:11:53.040 --> 00:11:54.949 align:start position:0%
groundwater and our drinking water
supplies

00:11:54.949 --> 00:11:54.959 align:start position:0%
supplies
 
00:11:56.870 --> 00:11:56.880 align:start position:0%
sediment trapping
 
00:11:58.470 --> 00:11:58.480 align:start position:0%
nutrient trapping retention and
 
00:12:00.389 --> 00:12:00.399 align:start position:0%
transformation this is something that's
 
00:12:01.910 --> 00:12:01.920 align:start position:0%
very valuable in the coastal community
 
00:12:03.350 --> 00:12:03.360 align:start position:0%
as well with
 
00:12:05.750 --> 00:12:05.760 align:start position:0%
nutrient trappings before it gets into
 
00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:06.550 align:start position:0%
nutrient trappings before it gets into
the

00:12:06.550 --> 00:12:06.560 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:12:09.990 --> 00:12:10.000 align:start position:0%
coastal areas and any rivers as well i
 
00:12:11.750 --> 00:12:11.760 align:start position:0%
know here in rochester we have problems
 
00:12:14.470 --> 00:12:14.480 align:start position:0%
with with nutrients in our in our
 
00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:15.670 align:start position:0%
with with nutrients in our in our
wastewater

00:12:15.670 --> 00:12:15.680 align:start position:0%
wastewater
 
00:12:17.670 --> 00:12:17.680 align:start position:0%
in the river out from the wastewater
 
00:12:18.949 --> 00:12:18.959 align:start position:0%
well a lot of this stuff is coming
 
00:12:20.870 --> 00:12:20.880 align:start position:0%
upstream downriver
 
00:12:23.509 --> 00:12:23.519 align:start position:0%
wetlands are able to help purify that
 
00:12:25.590 --> 00:12:25.600 align:start position:0%
also shoreline anchoring and
 
00:12:27.750 --> 00:12:27.760 align:start position:0%
noteworthiness i'm not sure exactly what
 
00:12:30.069 --> 00:12:30.079 align:start position:0%
noteworthiness means but pes put that in
 
00:12:32.150 --> 00:12:32.160 align:start position:0%
there and they obviously know what it
 
00:12:33.590 --> 00:12:33.600 align:start position:0%
means when they take over when you take
 
00:12:36.550 --> 00:12:36.560 align:start position:0%
a look at a wetland must have four of
 
00:12:38.790 --> 00:12:38.800 align:start position:0%
those criteria
 
00:12:41.910 --> 00:12:41.920 align:start position:0%
my life plus three additional now
 
00:12:43.269 --> 00:12:43.279 align:start position:0%
under this bill
 
00:12:44.790 --> 00:12:44.800 align:start position:0%
when you add
 
00:12:47.590 --> 00:12:47.600 align:start position:0%
something that's less than 50 feet
 
00:12:50.150 --> 00:12:50.160 align:start position:0%
you must consider it separately you must
 
00:12:52.389 --> 00:12:52.399 align:start position:0%
consider that that 50-foot piece that
 
00:12:54.870 --> 00:12:54.880 align:start position:0%
small piece has to have these same
 
00:12:54.880 --> 00:12:56.629 align:start position:0%
small piece has to have these same
requirements

00:12:56.629 --> 00:12:56.639 align:start position:0%
requirements
 
00:12:58.470 --> 00:12:58.480 align:start position:0%
so something that's a mile long or a
 
00:13:00.389 --> 00:13:00.399 align:start position:0%
half mile long or even a football field
 
00:13:00.399 --> 00:13:01.590 align:start position:0%
half mile long or even a football field
long

00:13:01.590 --> 00:13:01.600 align:start position:0%
long
 
00:13:03.829 --> 00:13:03.839 align:start position:0%
probably quite unusual that in the
 
00:13:05.750 --> 00:13:05.760 align:start position:0%
middle of that it would meet these
 
00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:07.030 align:start position:0%
middle of that it would meet these
requirements

00:13:07.030 --> 00:13:07.040 align:start position:0%
requirements
 
00:13:08.389 --> 00:13:08.399 align:start position:0%
so if you just use a little bit of
 
00:13:09.910 --> 00:13:09.920 align:start position:0%
common sense
 
00:13:11.590 --> 00:13:11.600 align:start position:0%
the chance of something that's less than
 
00:13:13.750 --> 00:13:13.760 align:start position:0%
50 feet wide
 
00:13:15.750 --> 00:13:15.760 align:start position:0%
is probably not going to meet the
 
00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:17.590 align:start position:0%
is probably not going to meet the
criteria

00:13:17.590 --> 00:13:17.600 align:start position:0%
criteria
 
00:13:18.870 --> 00:13:18.880 align:start position:0%
for a
 
00:13:20.629 --> 00:13:20.639 align:start position:0%
prime weapon
 
00:13:25.190 --> 00:13:25.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:28.310 --> 00:13:28.320 align:start position:0%
something else that we have that
 
00:13:30.150 --> 00:13:30.160 align:start position:0%
to just address the governor's veto for
 
00:13:31.509 --> 00:13:31.519 align:start position:0%
just a second
 
00:13:32.790 --> 00:13:32.800 align:start position:0%
one of the things when the governor
 
00:13:34.949 --> 00:13:34.959 align:start position:0%
vetoed this bill afterward went through
 
00:13:36.629 --> 00:13:36.639 align:start position:0%
the house was passed by the senate
 
00:13:38.550 --> 00:13:38.560 align:start position:0%
accepted by a conference committee he
 
00:13:40.230 --> 00:13:40.240 align:start position:0%
said that he
 
00:13:43.030 --> 00:13:43.040 align:start position:0%
he opposed it because it did not give
 
00:13:45.110 --> 00:13:45.120 align:start position:0%
enough consideration
 
00:13:47.430 --> 00:13:47.440 align:start position:0%
to the landowners the people whose land
 
00:13:50.710 --> 00:13:50.720 align:start position:0%
was going to be impacted
 
00:13:52.150 --> 00:13:52.160 align:start position:0%
first of all
 
00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:54.069 align:start position:0%
first of all
slave

00:13:54.069 --> 00:13:54.079 align:start position:0%
slave
 
00:13:54.079 --> 00:13:56.110 align:start position:0%
slave
consideration

00:13:56.110 --> 00:13:56.120 align:start position:0%
consideration
 
00:13:58.949 --> 00:13:58.959 align:start position:0%
acceleration or consideration the
 
00:14:01.189 --> 00:14:01.199 align:start position:0%
landlord landowners so basically the
 
00:14:02.470 --> 00:14:02.480 align:start position:0%
governor saying he's opposed to the
 
00:14:04.949 --> 00:14:04.959 align:start position:0%
current law as it states
 
00:14:06.870 --> 00:14:06.880 align:start position:0%
i understand that
 
00:14:08.870 --> 00:14:08.880 align:start position:0%
unfortunately it's the law
 
00:14:10.629 --> 00:14:10.639 align:start position:0%
if you want to change that
 
00:14:12.150 --> 00:14:12.160 align:start position:0%
repeal it
 
00:14:15.030 --> 00:14:15.040 align:start position:0%
what this bill actually does though
 
00:14:18.069 --> 00:14:18.079 align:start position:0%
is it gives extra consideration
 
00:14:19.990 --> 00:14:20.000 align:start position:0%
to the landowners because when a
 
00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:21.269 align:start position:0%
to the landowners because when a
landowner

00:14:21.269 --> 00:14:21.279 align:start position:0%
landowner
 
00:14:23.189 --> 00:14:23.199 align:start position:0%
land is being impacted or being
 
00:14:24.790 --> 00:14:24.800 align:start position:0%
determined to be within that prime
 
00:14:26.550 --> 00:14:26.560 align:start position:0%
wetland area that's less than 50 feet
 
00:14:28.550 --> 00:14:28.560 align:start position:0%
wide and this only deals with less than
 
00:14:30.550 --> 00:14:30.560 align:start position:0%
50 foot wide areas
 
00:14:33.829 --> 00:14:33.839 align:start position:0%
the landlord the the landowner must be
 
00:14:36.230 --> 00:14:36.240 align:start position:0%
considered the impacts on that land
 
00:14:38.310 --> 00:14:38.320 align:start position:0%
owner must be considered
 
00:14:39.750 --> 00:14:39.760 align:start position:0%
in order to be a prime wetland a
 
00:14:41.750 --> 00:14:41.760 align:start position:0%
conservation commission a planning board
 
00:14:44.470 --> 00:14:44.480 align:start position:0%
a local governing body needs to take a
 
00:14:46.150 --> 00:14:46.160 align:start position:0%
look at what they feel is an important
 
00:14:49.030 --> 00:14:49.040 align:start position:0%
prime weapon in their town as i said
 
00:14:51.509 --> 00:14:51.519 align:start position:0%
about 32 33 communities have adopted
 
00:14:53.590 --> 00:14:53.600 align:start position:0%
there's only a handful
 
00:14:55.269 --> 00:14:55.279 align:start position:0%
that are looking to adopt this and i
 
00:14:57.790 --> 00:14:57.800 align:start position:0%
don't see a big outpouring i mean since
 
00:14:57.800 --> 00:14:59.350 align:start position:0%
don't see a big outpouring i mean since
2012

00:14:59.350 --> 00:14:59.360 align:start position:0%
2012
 
00:15:03.350 --> 00:15:03.360 align:start position:0%
nobody has applied for a prime weapon
 
00:15:04.710 --> 00:15:04.720 align:start position:0%
i don't see this as being something
 
00:15:06.949 --> 00:15:06.959 align:start position:0%
that's going to be big but
 
00:15:08.949 --> 00:15:08.959 align:start position:0%
they have to go to get it approved as a
 
00:15:10.150 --> 00:15:10.160 align:start position:0%
prime well and they have to go through
 
00:15:13.110 --> 00:15:13.120 align:start position:0%
the same process as
 
00:15:15.189 --> 00:15:15.199 align:start position:0%
they would for a zoning ordinance
 
00:15:16.790 --> 00:15:16.800 align:start position:0%
all of you in town know that a zoning
 
00:15:18.230 --> 00:15:18.240 align:start position:0%
ordinance or the planning board it needs
 
00:15:20.310 --> 00:15:20.320 align:start position:0%
to go to public as that public parents
 
00:15:22.389 --> 00:15:22.399 align:start position:0%
it also has to have a wetland scientist
 
00:15:25.269 --> 00:15:25.279 align:start position:0%
do a study on that prime wetland to
 
00:15:27.990 --> 00:15:28.000 align:start position:0%
determine its importance and to validate
 
00:15:30.870 --> 00:15:30.880 align:start position:0%
that it meets four of the 12 criteria
 
00:15:32.949 --> 00:15:32.959 align:start position:0%
that are required to be designated as a
 
00:15:36.790 --> 00:15:36.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:40.389 --> 00:15:40.399 align:start position:0%
when we asked for the lesser land area
 
00:15:43.269 --> 00:15:43.279 align:start position:0%
we also go negotiated some gift facts
 
00:15:43.279 --> 00:15:44.389 align:start position:0%
we also go negotiated some gift facts
basically

00:15:44.389 --> 00:15:44.399 align:start position:0%
basically
 
00:15:46.629 --> 00:15:46.639 align:start position:0%
one was that the landowner needs to be
 
00:15:46.639 --> 00:15:48.310 align:start position:0%
one was that the landowner needs to be
considered

00:15:48.310 --> 00:15:48.320 align:start position:0%
considered
 
00:15:49.509 --> 00:15:49.519 align:start position:0%
and two
 
00:15:52.629 --> 00:15:52.639 align:start position:0%
we put an exemption in for dot
 
00:15:54.150 --> 00:15:54.160 align:start position:0%
right now if you're in a community where
 
00:15:56.230 --> 00:15:56.240 align:start position:0%
you have flooding and it's got a prime
 
00:15:57.829 --> 00:15:57.839 align:start position:0%
wetland in it
 
00:15:59.990 --> 00:16:00.000 align:start position:0%
you've got to wait
 
00:16:02.389 --> 00:16:02.399 align:start position:0%
20 days for the state to review this and
 
00:16:04.230 --> 00:16:04.240 align:start position:0%
then for the for the state review within
 
00:16:05.990 --> 00:16:06.000 align:start position:0%
20 additional days for the local
 
00:16:07.509 --> 00:16:07.519 align:start position:0%
community to before you can go in and
 
00:16:08.550 --> 00:16:08.560 align:start position:0%
you can work
 
00:16:10.470 --> 00:16:10.480 align:start position:0%
to basically make improvements if a road
 
00:16:13.030 --> 00:16:13.040 align:start position:0%
gets washed out
 
00:16:15.590 --> 00:16:15.600 align:start position:0%
our exemption not only applies to these
 
00:16:18.550 --> 00:16:18.560 align:start position:0%
small areas but also applies to
 
00:16:20.629 --> 00:16:20.639 align:start position:0%
prime wetlands in general
 
00:16:22.150 --> 00:16:22.160 align:start position:0%
so that if there is a problem an
 
00:16:24.550 --> 00:16:24.560 align:start position:0%
emergency this will save a lot of time
 
00:16:26.470 --> 00:16:26.480 align:start position:0%
and also money
 
00:16:28.790 --> 00:16:28.800 align:start position:0%
for d.o.t to go in and do road
 
00:16:30.710 --> 00:16:30.720 align:start position:0%
improvements this is what surprised me
 
00:16:32.150 --> 00:16:32.160 align:start position:0%
the most when the governor you know the
 
00:16:34.230 --> 00:16:34.240 align:start position:0%
original this was in there
 
00:16:36.389 --> 00:16:36.399 align:start position:0%
and and having been a town planner and
 
00:16:38.710 --> 00:16:38.720 align:start position:0%
also a city councilman i understand here
 
00:16:41.749 --> 00:16:41.759 align:start position:0%
in rochester i understand the importance
 
00:16:43.110 --> 00:16:43.120 align:start position:0%
of being able to get in there and get
 
00:16:44.870 --> 00:16:44.880 align:start position:0%
the work done quickly
 
00:16:46.870 --> 00:16:46.880 align:start position:0%
particularly if it's it's a major road
 
00:16:49.829 --> 00:16:49.839 align:start position:0%
that's been washed out or impacted by
 
00:16:52.389 --> 00:16:52.399 align:start position:0%
flooding or other damage that working
 
00:16:53.749 --> 00:16:53.759 align:start position:0%
with a prime wetland is something that
 
00:16:55.590 --> 00:16:55.600 align:start position:0%
we have to trust d.o.t to go in there
 
00:16:57.590 --> 00:16:57.600 align:start position:0%
and do a good job now i know some of the
 
00:16:59.670 --> 00:16:59.680 align:start position:0%
conservation groups are opposed to that
 
00:17:02.629 --> 00:17:02.639 align:start position:0%
portion of it don't have that taken out
 
00:17:04.069 --> 00:17:04.079 align:start position:0%
but as someone who has worked on both
 
00:17:05.429 --> 00:17:05.439 align:start position:0%
sides of the issue i felt it was
 
00:17:09.350 --> 00:17:09.360 align:start position:0%
important to protect dot's interest when
 
00:17:11.429 --> 00:17:11.439 align:start position:0%
it came to prime wetland as well as
 
00:17:14.710 --> 00:17:14.720 align:start position:0%
letting the local communities
 
00:17:17.029 --> 00:17:17.039 align:start position:0%
designate prime wetlands protect their
 
00:17:18.630 --> 00:17:18.640 align:start position:0%
natural resources protect their
 
00:17:21.110 --> 00:17:21.120 align:start position:0%
groundwater protect wildlife habitat in
 
00:17:23.270 --> 00:17:23.280 align:start position:0%
their communities
 
00:17:24.549 --> 00:17:24.559 align:start position:0%
mr chairman you're going to have other
 
00:17:25.669 --> 00:17:25.679 align:start position:0%
people that are going to be speaking i
 
00:17:27.189 --> 00:17:27.199 align:start position:0%
know we've got one letter that says if
 
00:17:28.789 --> 00:17:28.799 align:start position:0%
this bill passed it's going to land lock
 
00:17:32.470 --> 00:17:32.480 align:start position:0%
pieces of land this is just not true the
 
00:17:35.590 --> 00:17:35.600 align:start position:0%
current law as it states and those 32
 
00:17:35.600 --> 00:17:38.630 align:start position:0%
current law as it states and those 32
communities

00:17:38.630 --> 00:17:38.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:39.909 --> 00:17:39.919 align:start position:0%
if they have problem with the bill they
 
00:17:42.310 --> 00:17:42.320 align:start position:0%
have it as it as the law currently is
 
00:17:45.190 --> 00:17:45.200 align:start position:0%
this bill does nothing to change that
 
00:17:47.270 --> 00:17:47.280 align:start position:0%
and no communities are going to be no
 
00:17:49.029 --> 00:17:49.039 align:start position:0%
land is going to be landlocked
 
00:17:50.789 --> 00:17:50.799 align:start position:0%
in nowhere does it say in the prime
 
00:17:53.270 --> 00:17:53.280 align:start position:0%
wetlands organize the primary wetlands
 
00:17:55.270 --> 00:17:55.280 align:start position:0%
rsas or the regulations that were
 
00:17:57.110 --> 00:17:57.120 align:start position:0%
adopted to prove it that you can't
 
00:17:58.950 --> 00:17:58.960 align:start position:0%
develop a prime weapon
 
00:18:00.950 --> 00:18:00.960 align:start position:0%
you just have to go through more
 
00:18:03.029 --> 00:18:03.039 align:start position:0%
consideration and there's a when it's
 
00:18:05.029 --> 00:18:05.039 align:start position:0%
considered a prime wetland within that
 
00:18:07.029 --> 00:18:07.039 align:start position:0%
community you can do all the development
 
00:18:09.029 --> 00:18:09.039 align:start position:0%
you want if you can get approval virgin
 
00:18:11.350 --> 00:18:11.360 align:start position:0%
fir dredge and fill permits may take a
 
00:18:13.750 --> 00:18:13.760 align:start position:0%
little longer but only in those areas
 
00:18:16.630 --> 00:18:16.640 align:start position:0%
that are determined to be prime weapons
 
00:18:17.990 --> 00:18:18.000 align:start position:0%
what we
 
00:18:19.590 --> 00:18:19.600 align:start position:0%
a prime wetland
 
00:18:21.590 --> 00:18:21.600 align:start position:0%
under the current regulation where it is
 
00:18:23.830 --> 00:18:23.840 align:start position:0%
needs to be a
 
00:18:26.390 --> 00:18:26.400 align:start position:0%
geometric shape
 
00:18:28.390 --> 00:18:28.400 align:start position:0%
near the debates we've had about this
 
00:18:30.470 --> 00:18:30.480 align:start position:0%
myself and the chairman in particular we
 
00:18:32.870 --> 00:18:32.880 align:start position:0%
talked about the fingers and toes
 
00:18:34.390 --> 00:18:34.400 align:start position:0%
wetlands are not
 
00:18:36.870 --> 00:18:36.880 align:start position:0%
perfect geometric shapes
 
00:18:39.110 --> 00:18:39.120 align:start position:0%
they have rills they have ditch client
 
00:18:41.350 --> 00:18:41.360 align:start position:0%
pitches they have other things one of
 
00:18:42.549 --> 00:18:42.559 align:start position:0%
the other things we put in the bill that
 
00:18:45.029 --> 00:18:45.039 align:start position:0%
i didn't mention as well is that we also
 
00:18:46.950 --> 00:18:46.960 align:start position:0%
added a provision that say no man-made
 
00:18:48.870 --> 00:18:48.880 align:start position:0%
structures would be able to be
 
00:18:51.430 --> 00:18:51.440 align:start position:0%
considered as prime wetlands
 
00:18:53.669 --> 00:18:53.679 align:start position:0%
so we've taken out man-made structures
 
00:18:56.870 --> 00:18:56.880 align:start position:0%
we've added the provision that
 
00:18:58.950 --> 00:18:58.960 align:start position:0%
landowners need to be considered we've
 
00:19:01.909 --> 00:19:01.919 align:start position:0%
added a provision for dot for a waiver
 
00:19:03.270 --> 00:19:03.280 align:start position:0%
for dot
 
00:19:05.830 --> 00:19:05.840 align:start position:0%
all we're asking is that you allow the
 
00:19:08.789 --> 00:19:08.799 align:start position:0%
prime wetland to be defined the way it
 
00:19:11.430 --> 00:19:11.440 align:start position:0%
naturally exists it has those fingers
 
00:19:13.029 --> 00:19:13.039 align:start position:0%
and toes
 
00:19:15.270 --> 00:19:15.280 align:start position:0%
i'll rest here and uh i'm sure that
 
00:19:16.950 --> 00:19:16.960 align:start position:0%
you'll have other people and i know mr
 
00:19:18.549 --> 00:19:18.559 align:start position:0%

all right
uh

00:19:57.669 --> 00:19:57.679 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:20:00.230 --> 00:20:00.240 align:start position:0%
the members of the committee have a
 
00:20:06.470 --> 00:20:06.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:08.310 --> 00:20:08.320 align:start position:0%

uh thank you for a question uh mr
 
00:20:10.559 --> 00:20:11.510 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for a question uh mr
chairman

00:20:11.510 --> 00:20:11.520 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
00:20:13.909 --> 00:20:13.919 align:start position:0%
uh representative grassy uh
 
00:20:16.710 --> 00:20:16.720 align:start position:0%
great testimony i and i understand the
 
00:20:20.070 --> 00:20:20.080 align:start position:0%
importance of protecting the wetlands
 
00:20:23.430 --> 00:20:23.440 align:start position:0%
but but this 50 feet is actually 250
 
00:20:25.350 --> 00:20:25.360 align:start position:0%
feet if you have a 100 foot setback is
 
00:20:26.630 --> 00:20:26.640 align:start position:0%
that correct
 
00:20:28.470 --> 00:20:28.480 align:start position:0%
that's that's the thing the 100 foot
 
00:20:31.510 --> 00:20:31.520 align:start position:0%
setback was taken out in 2012 it does
 
00:20:32.950 --> 00:20:32.960 align:start position:0%
not exist
 
00:20:32.960 --> 00:20:33.750 align:start position:0%
not exist
so

00:20:33.750 --> 00:20:33.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:20:36.310 --> 00:20:36.320 align:start position:0%
the the the problem is
 
00:20:38.230 --> 00:20:38.240 align:start position:0%
is that under current
 
00:20:38.240 --> 00:20:39.510 align:start position:0%
is that under current
law

00:20:39.510 --> 00:20:39.520 align:start position:0%
law
 
00:20:41.029 --> 00:20:41.039 align:start position:0%
those wetlands that were approved
 
00:20:45.430 --> 00:20:45.440 align:start position:0%
between 2009 and 2012
 
00:20:47.669 --> 00:20:47.679 align:start position:0%
do have the 50 foot
 
00:20:50.070 --> 00:20:50.080 align:start position:0%
they are mapped out at 50 feet and they
 
00:20:52.789 --> 00:20:52.799 align:start position:0%
have the 100 foot buffer so under the
 
00:20:54.230 --> 00:20:54.240 align:start position:0%
current law
 
00:20:55.750 --> 00:20:55.760 align:start position:0%
not what i'm proposing here but the
 
00:20:58.549 --> 00:20:58.559 align:start position:0%
current law yes you are correct it could
 
00:21:01.909 --> 00:21:01.919 align:start position:0%
be 250 feet that's current law that has
 
00:21:03.270 --> 00:21:03.280 align:start position:0%
nothing to do with this bill and this
 
00:21:05.029 --> 00:21:05.039 align:start position:0%
bill won't paint that
 
00:21:07.110 --> 00:21:07.120 align:start position:0%
what this bill does is it says that we
 
00:21:10.549 --> 00:21:10.559 align:start position:0%
want work within that 50-foot area and
 
00:21:13.430 --> 00:21:13.440 align:start position:0%
only the 50-foot area not the buffer
 
00:21:15.430 --> 00:21:15.440 align:start position:0%
because it there is no buffer it was
 
00:21:17.669 --> 00:21:17.679 align:start position:0%
taken out in 2012.
 
00:21:19.190 --> 00:21:19.200 align:start position:0%
we're not asking if the buffer be put
 
00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:21.110 align:start position:0%
we're not asking if the buffer be put
back

00:21:21.110 --> 00:21:21.120 align:start position:0%
back
 
00:21:23.750 --> 00:21:23.760 align:start position:0%
just that 50-foot area is the area the
 
00:21:25.029 --> 00:21:25.039 align:start position:0%
land that we want additional
 
00:21:27.830 --> 00:21:27.840 align:start position:0%
consideration taken when reviewed by
 
00:21:30.470 --> 00:21:30.480 align:start position:0%
when reviewed by des and when the local
 
00:21:31.990 --> 00:21:32.000 align:start position:0%
planning board takes a look at what the
 
00:21:33.590 --> 00:21:33.600 align:start position:0%
work that they're doing within that
 
00:21:33.600 --> 00:21:34.710 align:start position:0%
work that they're doing within that
wetland

00:21:34.710 --> 00:21:34.720 align:start position:0%
wetland
 
00:21:37.350 --> 00:21:37.360 align:start position:0%
okay thank you for a follow-up sir
 
00:21:39.830 --> 00:21:39.840 align:start position:0%
for a follow-up yeah and okay thank you
 
00:21:41.510 --> 00:21:41.520 align:start position:0%
for for that answer and that
 
00:21:41.520 --> 00:21:43.190 align:start position:0%
for for that answer and that
clarification

00:21:43.190 --> 00:21:43.200 align:start position:0%
clarification
 
00:21:46.470 --> 00:21:46.480 align:start position:0%
um the other question is as a landowner
 
00:21:48.230 --> 00:21:48.240 align:start position:0%
in a wetlands i'm very familiar with
 
00:21:50.310 --> 00:21:50.320 align:start position:0%
this process
 
00:21:52.630 --> 00:21:52.640 align:start position:0%
if this bill passed
 
00:21:52.640 --> 00:21:54.630 align:start position:0%
if this bill passed
um

00:21:54.630 --> 00:21:54.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:21:57.510 --> 00:21:57.520 align:start position:0%
then and let's say i as a landowner had
 
00:21:59.350 --> 00:21:59.360 align:start position:0%
a 50-foot
 
00:22:01.029 --> 00:22:01.039 align:start position:0%
piece that was
 
00:22:02.789 --> 00:22:02.799 align:start position:0%
uh in
 
00:22:04.630 --> 00:22:04.640 align:start position:0%
prime wetlands
 
00:22:06.710 --> 00:22:06.720 align:start position:0%
then not only would i have to go to the
 
00:22:09.669 --> 00:22:09.679 align:start position:0%
local guys for approval within the local
 
00:22:12.230 --> 00:22:12.240 align:start position:0%
ones but then for the prime wetlands i
 
00:22:16.149 --> 00:22:16.159 align:start position:0%
would now be required to go to the state
 
00:22:18.710 --> 00:22:18.720 align:start position:0%
at the state zoning
 
00:22:20.070 --> 00:22:20.080 align:start position:0%
hearing which you
 
00:22:22.390 --> 00:22:22.400 align:start position:0%
which you mentioned then the state would
 
00:22:22.400 --> 00:22:23.270 align:start position:0%
which you mentioned then the state would
then

00:22:23.270 --> 00:22:23.280 align:start position:0%
then
 
00:22:23.280 --> 00:22:24.630 align:start position:0%
then
apply

00:22:24.630 --> 00:22:24.640 align:start position:0%
apply
 
00:22:27.270 --> 00:22:27.280 align:start position:0%
or be able to apply four of the 12
 
00:22:27.280 --> 00:22:29.029 align:start position:0%
or be able to apply four of the 12
requirements

00:22:29.029 --> 00:22:29.039 align:start position:0%
requirements
 
00:22:31.190 --> 00:22:31.200 align:start position:0%
in addition to the local requirements of
 
00:22:32.789 --> 00:22:32.799 align:start position:0%
the local weapons
 
00:22:36.470 --> 00:22:36.480 align:start position:0%
and so what i don't understand is how
 
00:22:39.110 --> 00:22:39.120 align:start position:0%
this then adds additional onus on the
 
00:22:40.950 --> 00:22:40.960 align:start position:0%
owner to go to the state
 
00:22:42.950 --> 00:22:42.960 align:start position:0%
as well as whatever local ordinances
 
00:22:44.630 --> 00:22:44.640 align:start position:0%
they would be required
 
00:22:46.310 --> 00:22:46.320 align:start position:0%
right did i miss something on that i'm
 
00:22:48.710 --> 00:22:48.720 align:start position:0%
sorry i'm i'm new at this
 
00:22:50.950 --> 00:22:50.960 align:start position:0%
that's all right representative no it's
 
00:22:53.350 --> 00:22:53.360 align:start position:0%
it's it's not as complicated as that
 
00:22:54.470 --> 00:22:54.480 align:start position:0%
first of all if you're going to be doing
 
00:22:55.990 --> 00:22:56.000 align:start position:0%
work in a woman's period you're going to
 
00:22:58.230 --> 00:22:58.240 align:start position:0%
have to get a dredge and fill permit
 
00:22:59.909 --> 00:22:59.919 align:start position:0%
and when you go to get that dredge and
 
00:23:02.149 --> 00:23:02.159 align:start position:0%
full permit or a weapon crossing
 
00:23:04.070 --> 00:23:04.080 align:start position:0%
whatever it may be the state's going to
 
00:23:06.630 --> 00:23:06.640 align:start position:0%
take a look at it anyway now those 12
 
00:23:07.909 --> 00:23:07.919 align:start position:0%
criteria that you have they're not
 
00:23:09.909 --> 00:23:09.919 align:start position:0%
something that's applied by the state
 
00:23:12.230 --> 00:23:12.240 align:start position:0%
applied prior to the designation of a
 
00:23:14.070 --> 00:23:14.080 align:start position:0%
crime wetland
 
00:23:16.230 --> 00:23:16.240 align:start position:0%
a prime weapon
 
00:23:18.149 --> 00:23:18.159 align:start position:0%
becomes a prime well because it meets
 
00:23:21.029 --> 00:23:21.039 align:start position:0%
for these 12 requirements
 
00:23:23.590 --> 00:23:23.600 align:start position:0%
the state is just going to say okay if
 
00:23:25.270 --> 00:23:25.280 align:start position:0%
the town has determined that it meets
 
00:23:26.789 --> 00:23:26.799 align:start position:0%
the requirements we've approved it
 
00:23:26.799 --> 00:23:27.669 align:start position:0%
the requirements we've approved it
because

00:23:27.669 --> 00:23:27.679 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:23:29.590 --> 00:23:29.600 align:start position:0%
out of the process the state also has
 
00:23:30.950 --> 00:23:30.960 align:start position:0%
taken and approve it as a private
 
00:23:33.110 --> 00:23:33.120 align:start position:0%
wetland as well to make a double check
 
00:23:37.669 --> 00:23:37.679 align:start position:0%
the pound before the designation is made
 
00:23:38.950 --> 00:23:38.960 align:start position:0%
they're going to take a look at it and
 
00:23:40.870 --> 00:23:40.880 align:start position:0%
they're going to basically say okay
 
00:23:42.549 --> 00:23:42.559 align:start position:0%
we're looking at your dredging field
 
00:23:44.470 --> 00:23:44.480 align:start position:0%
permit or your weapons crossing or
 
00:23:46.070 --> 00:23:46.080 align:start position:0%
whatever you're planning on doing within
 
00:23:47.590 --> 00:23:47.600 align:start position:0%
this prime weapon
 
00:23:49.669 --> 00:23:49.679 align:start position:0%
we will now notify the local community
 
00:23:52.070 --> 00:23:52.080 align:start position:0%
that you've applied for a crossing
 
00:23:53.590 --> 00:23:53.600 align:start position:0%
pricing the town may not even know that
 
00:23:55.350 --> 00:23:55.360 align:start position:0%
you're doing this in fact
 
00:23:57.510 --> 00:23:57.520 align:start position:0%
uh but you've applied to the state for a
 
00:23:59.430 --> 00:23:59.440 align:start position:0%
permit to cross a weapon to impact the
 
00:23:59.440 --> 00:24:01.190 align:start position:0%
permit to cross a weapon to impact the
weapon

00:24:01.190 --> 00:24:01.200 align:start position:0%
weapon
 
00:24:03.029 --> 00:24:03.039 align:start position:0%
they're going to
 
00:24:05.190 --> 00:24:05.200 align:start position:0%
notify the local community
 
00:24:07.190 --> 00:24:07.200 align:start position:0%
that you applied and they will have the
 
00:24:09.990 --> 00:24:10.000 align:start position:0%
local community of 20 days to respond if
 
00:24:12.230 --> 00:24:12.240 align:start position:0%
they don't respond because they feel not
 
00:24:13.750 --> 00:24:13.760 align:start position:0%
an issue they've gone out looked at it
 
00:24:15.830 --> 00:24:15.840 align:start position:0%
they've said they've probably said your
 
00:24:17.590 --> 00:24:17.600 align:start position:0%
local neighbors have probably sat down
 
00:24:19.590 --> 00:24:19.600 align:start position:0%
with you and said hey what are you doing
 
00:24:20.710 --> 00:24:20.720 align:start position:0%
and you say well i'm just putting this
 
00:24:22.950 --> 00:24:22.960 align:start position:0%
crossing so i can timber that site
 
00:24:24.950 --> 00:24:24.960 align:start position:0%
um on the other side of the small
 
00:24:26.710 --> 00:24:26.720 align:start position:0%
wetland that i have
 
00:24:28.710 --> 00:24:28.720 align:start position:0%
and they may look at and they say not a
 
00:24:30.789 --> 00:24:30.799 align:start position:0%
problem now that small wetland isn't
 
00:24:32.390 --> 00:24:32.400 align:start position:0%
going to be just a small wetland itself
 
00:24:35.190 --> 00:24:35.200 align:start position:0%
it's it's attached to a larger wetland
 
00:24:37.190 --> 00:24:37.200 align:start position:0%
which has to be over two acres
 
00:24:40.070 --> 00:24:40.080 align:start position:0%
so uh it's it's part of a larger wetland
 
00:24:41.590 --> 00:24:41.600 align:start position:0%
as well if it isn't part of that larger
 
00:24:44.310 --> 00:24:44.320 align:start position:0%
wetland it can't be considered
 
00:24:45.990 --> 00:24:46.000 align:start position:0%
as a prime wetland so you wouldn't have
 
00:24:47.510 --> 00:24:47.520 align:start position:0%
you'd still have to get a violence
 
00:24:47.520 --> 00:24:48.470 align:start position:0%
you'd still have to get a violence
crossing

00:24:48.470 --> 00:24:48.480 align:start position:0%
crossing
 
00:24:51.190 --> 00:24:51.200 align:start position:0%
um and and that's the only time you'd
 
00:24:52.950 --> 00:24:52.960 align:start position:0%
apply to the state for it
 
00:24:55.590 --> 00:24:55.600 align:start position:0%
having worked as a town planner uh
 
00:24:57.669 --> 00:24:57.679 align:start position:0%
sometimes i would only find out that
 
00:24:58.950 --> 00:24:58.960 align:start position:0%
there was work being done out in the
 
00:25:00.070 --> 00:25:00.080 align:start position:0%
woods that a wetland crossing was
 
00:25:01.350 --> 00:25:01.360 align:start position:0%
happening was i got a call from the
 
00:25:01.360 --> 00:25:02.630 align:start position:0%
happening was i got a call from the
state

00:25:02.630 --> 00:25:02.640 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:25:04.470 --> 00:25:04.480 align:start position:0%
and the state would say hey you've got
 
00:25:05.830 --> 00:25:05.840 align:start position:0%
somebody out there do you have any
 
00:25:07.590 --> 00:25:07.600 align:start position:0%
comments you'd like to make because it
 
00:25:10.390 --> 00:25:10.400 align:start position:0%
was a piece of land that qualified under
 
00:25:12.710 --> 00:25:12.720 align:start position:0%
this requirement um
 
00:25:12.720 --> 00:25:13.750 align:start position:0%
this requirement um
the

00:25:13.750 --> 00:25:13.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:25:15.190 --> 00:25:15.200 align:start position:0%
just the wetlands not even a prime
 
00:25:16.950 --> 00:25:16.960 align:start position:0%
weapons i have never worked in a
 
00:25:18.470 --> 00:25:18.480 align:start position:0%
community that had crime watkins
 
00:25:20.789 --> 00:25:20.799 align:start position:0%
designations but i have had communities
 
00:25:22.549 --> 00:25:22.559 align:start position:0%
that have wetlands sometimes the state
 
00:25:23.990 --> 00:25:24.000 align:start position:0%
would call us and say you know we're
 
00:25:26.310 --> 00:25:26.320 align:start position:0%
doing this as a courtesy for you go out
 
00:25:27.430 --> 00:25:27.440 align:start position:0%
and take a look at what's going on
 
00:25:28.630 --> 00:25:28.640 align:start position:0%
because we don't have time to go out and
 
00:25:30.230 --> 00:25:30.240 align:start position:0%
look at this
 
00:25:32.230 --> 00:25:32.240 align:start position:0%
but no i don't see it as something that
 
00:25:34.549 --> 00:25:34.559 align:start position:0%
as you as an owner of the land are going
 
00:25:36.230 --> 00:25:36.240 align:start position:0%
to be
 
00:25:37.350 --> 00:25:37.360 align:start position:0%
this is not something that's going to
 
00:25:38.470 --> 00:25:38.480 align:start position:0%
cause you any
 
00:25:40.470 --> 00:25:40.480 align:start position:0%
great hardship it may be a sliding
 
00:25:42.470 --> 00:25:42.480 align:start position:0%
convenience but not a great hatred
 
00:25:44.630 --> 00:25:44.640 align:start position:0%
that's actually the current law that's
 
00:25:47.590 --> 00:25:47.600 align:start position:0%
not this bill it's the current law
 
00:25:48.710 --> 00:25:48.720 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative i
 
00:25:51.510 --> 00:25:51.520 align:start position:0%

uh thank you very much chairman uh for
 
00:26:57.430 --> 00:26:57.440 align:start position:0%
the record uh my name is gary abbott i'm
 
00:26:59.590 --> 00:26:59.600 align:start position:0%
the executive vice president of the
 
00:27:02.630 --> 00:27:02.640 align:start position:0%
associated general contractors and happy
 
00:27:05.350 --> 00:27:05.360 align:start position:0%
to be here today uh before your
 
00:27:09.990 --> 00:27:10.000 align:start position:0%
committee to talk about house bill 158
 
00:27:12.630 --> 00:27:12.640 align:start position:0%
one the association strongly opposes
 
00:27:14.070 --> 00:27:14.080 align:start position:0%
this bill and one of the things you're
 
00:27:15.669 --> 00:27:15.679 align:start position:0%
going to find is
 
00:27:17.510 --> 00:27:17.520 align:start position:0%
i think representative grassy did a
 
00:27:20.310 --> 00:27:20.320 align:start position:0%
great job of explaining the functions of
 
00:27:21.669 --> 00:27:21.679 align:start position:0%
a wetland
 
00:27:24.070 --> 00:27:24.080 align:start position:0%
but wetlands are wetlands whether big or
 
00:27:24.080 --> 00:27:25.750 align:start position:0%
but wetlands are wetlands whether big or
small

00:27:25.750 --> 00:27:25.760 align:start position:0%
small
 
00:27:28.470 --> 00:27:28.480 align:start position:0%
and those areas in which are smaller are
 
00:27:30.870 --> 00:27:30.880 align:start position:0%
still regulated by the department of
 
00:27:33.590 --> 00:27:33.600 align:start position:0%
environmental services
 
00:27:36.789 --> 00:27:36.799 align:start position:0%
over the years since 2012 it's clear
 
00:27:38.789 --> 00:27:38.799 align:start position:0%
that the department has put in
 
00:27:40.310 --> 00:27:40.320 align:start position:0%
additional rules
 
00:27:42.870 --> 00:27:42.880 align:start position:0%
and made it much much more difficult for
 
00:27:45.590 --> 00:27:45.600 align:start position:0%
developers uh people doing construction
 
00:27:48.230 --> 00:27:48.240 align:start position:0%
on projects that have
 
00:27:50.390 --> 00:27:50.400 align:start position:0%
definitely you have to do an awful lot
 
00:27:54.389 --> 00:27:54.399 align:start position:0%
or mitigate in order to get a permit
 
00:27:55.909 --> 00:27:55.919 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
00:27:59.750 --> 00:27:59.760 align:start position:0%
sets us back to prior to 2012.
 
00:28:02.310 --> 00:28:02.320 align:start position:0%
we had issues and we corrected those
 
00:28:06.789 --> 00:28:06.799 align:start position:0%
issues with the legislature back in 2012
 
00:28:09.430 --> 00:28:09.440 align:start position:0%
by setting in place this 50-foot
 
00:28:12.549 --> 00:28:12.559 align:start position:0%
limitation for this higher category
 
00:28:14.230 --> 00:28:14.240 align:start position:0%
prime wetlands
 
00:28:16.789 --> 00:28:16.799 align:start position:0%
prime wetlands are those
 
00:28:19.350 --> 00:28:19.360 align:start position:0%
that are designated by the town
 
00:28:21.510 --> 00:28:21.520 align:start position:0%
they're just as valuable in some cases
 
00:28:23.990 --> 00:28:24.000 align:start position:0%
as regular wetlands and we have wetland
 
00:28:26.789 --> 00:28:26.799 align:start position:0%
regulations but what was happening is
 
00:28:28.590 --> 00:28:28.600 align:start position:0%
we were getting inconsistent
 
00:28:31.029 --> 00:28:31.039 align:start position:0%
delineations of where those boundaries
 
00:28:31.039 --> 00:28:32.070 align:start position:0%
delineations of where those boundaries
were

00:28:32.070 --> 00:28:32.080 align:start position:0%
were
 
00:28:34.870 --> 00:28:34.880 align:start position:0%
and even in some cases roadside ditches
 
00:28:37.269 --> 00:28:37.279 align:start position:0%
and other things were included which
 
00:28:39.190 --> 00:28:39.200 align:start position:0%
would land lock an awful lot of
 
00:28:39.200 --> 00:28:40.950 align:start position:0%
would land lock an awful lot of
properties

00:28:40.950 --> 00:28:40.960 align:start position:0%
properties
 
00:28:43.830 --> 00:28:43.840 align:start position:0%
the legislature looked at those cases
 
00:28:45.669 --> 00:28:45.679 align:start position:0%
and made the determination that if we
 
00:28:48.070 --> 00:28:48.080 align:start position:0%
were going to do prime wetlands it's two
 
00:28:50.149 --> 00:28:50.159 align:start position:0%
prime wetlands that received the larger
 
00:28:50.159 --> 00:28:51.269 align:start position:0%
prime wetlands that received the larger
wetlands

00:28:51.269 --> 00:28:51.279 align:start position:0%
wetlands
 
00:28:53.350 --> 00:28:53.360 align:start position:0%
it's to save two acres or more that are
 
00:28:56.149 --> 00:28:56.159 align:start position:0%
prime wetlands not the really tiny ones
 
00:28:58.389 --> 00:28:58.399 align:start position:0%
it was put in place to signify that
 
00:29:01.269 --> 00:29:01.279 align:start position:0%
those were uh the town had signified
 
00:29:03.590 --> 00:29:03.600 align:start position:0%
them as special now some towns had
 
00:29:03.600 --> 00:29:04.950 align:start position:0%
them as special now some towns had
signified

00:29:04.950 --> 00:29:04.960 align:start position:0%
signified
 
00:29:07.430 --> 00:29:07.440 align:start position:0%
uh town of salem had signified some
 
00:29:10.230 --> 00:29:10.240 align:start position:0%
large acreage as prime wetlands
 
00:29:12.389 --> 00:29:12.399 align:start position:0%
and then they had to widen their road
 
00:29:15.110 --> 00:29:15.120 align:start position:0%
and guess what they undesignated the
 
00:29:17.269 --> 00:29:17.279 align:start position:0%
prime wetlands because of the conflicts
 
00:29:20.149 --> 00:29:20.159 align:start position:0%
they had in order to do that
 
00:29:21.909 --> 00:29:21.919 align:start position:0%
so those are some of the things we saw
 
00:29:24.070 --> 00:29:24.080 align:start position:0%
in the past 2012
 
00:29:26.630 --> 00:29:26.640 align:start position:0%
corrected this by putting in that
 
00:29:29.110 --> 00:29:29.120 align:start position:0%
50-foot delineation of anything that's
 
00:29:31.430 --> 00:29:31.440 align:start position:0%
less than 50 feet couldn't be qualified
 
00:29:33.190 --> 00:29:33.200 align:start position:0%
as prime wetlands
 
00:29:35.269 --> 00:29:35.279 align:start position:0%
and it's worked great
 
00:29:36.950 --> 00:29:36.960 align:start position:0%
for all these years in the sense that
 
00:29:39.750 --> 00:29:39.760 align:start position:0%
delineations are very clear now
 
00:29:41.110 --> 00:29:41.120 align:start position:0%
you could probably have wetland
 
00:29:43.510 --> 00:29:43.520 align:start position:0%
scientists talk on either side of how
 
00:29:47.029 --> 00:29:47.039 align:start position:0%
important it is to go beyond or less the
 
00:29:49.430 --> 00:29:49.440 align:start position:0%
problem is is that it becomes subjective
 
00:29:51.350 --> 00:29:51.360 align:start position:0%
and it gets difficult for an applicant
 
00:29:53.510 --> 00:29:53.520 align:start position:0%
to know what those boundaries are
 
00:29:55.990 --> 00:29:56.000 align:start position:0%
because there are tougher regulations if
 
00:29:58.789 --> 00:29:58.799 align:start position:0%
you go through des
 
00:30:00.230 --> 00:30:00.240 align:start position:0%
and you hit a prime wetlands it
 
00:30:02.710 --> 00:30:02.720 align:start position:0%
classifies you as a special resource
 
00:30:02.720 --> 00:30:03.990 align:start position:0%
classifies you as a special resource
area

00:30:03.990 --> 00:30:04.000 align:start position:0%
area
 
00:30:06.070 --> 00:30:06.080 align:start position:0%
in the rules which you have to go to a
 
00:30:07.909 --> 00:30:07.919 align:start position:0%
different standard and much harder to
 
00:30:07.919 --> 00:30:09.669 align:start position:0%
different standard and much harder to
develop

00:30:09.669 --> 00:30:09.679 align:start position:0%
develop
 
00:30:13.430 --> 00:30:13.440 align:start position:0%
so i did include a position paper i also
 
00:30:15.110 --> 00:30:15.120 align:start position:0%
included a map
 
00:30:15.120 --> 00:30:16.230 align:start position:0%
included a map
that

00:30:16.230 --> 00:30:16.240 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:30:18.710 --> 00:30:18.720 align:start position:0%
we presented last time this bill was
 
00:30:20.389 --> 00:30:20.399 align:start position:0%
before the senate
 
00:30:23.510 --> 00:30:23.520 align:start position:0%
to give you a significance of
 
00:30:26.070 --> 00:30:26.080 align:start position:0%
how the area of where a prime wetland is
 
00:30:28.789 --> 00:30:28.799 align:start position:0%
currently delineated and if you let that
 
00:30:31.269 --> 00:30:31.279 align:start position:0%
area be less than 50 feet
 
00:30:33.029 --> 00:30:33.039 align:start position:0%
a small portion could suddenly
 
00:30:35.510 --> 00:30:35.520 align:start position:0%
encompasses a whole bunch of smaller
 
00:30:37.510 --> 00:30:37.520 align:start position:0%
ones and i don't think that was the
 
00:30:39.350 --> 00:30:39.360 align:start position:0%
original intent
 
00:30:41.510 --> 00:30:41.520 align:start position:0%
of prime wetlands so we look at this
 
00:30:44.230 --> 00:30:44.240 align:start position:0%
bill as a huge expansion of the prime
 
00:30:45.909 --> 00:30:45.919 align:start position:0%
wetlands statute
 
00:30:48.470 --> 00:30:48.480 align:start position:0%
which would affect a lot of developable
 
00:30:51.350 --> 00:30:51.360 align:start position:0%
property and i represent contractors in
 
00:30:52.870 --> 00:30:52.880 align:start position:0%
the state of new hampshire i represent
 
00:30:55.350 --> 00:30:55.360 align:start position:0%
commercial and industrial contractors
 
00:30:57.190 --> 00:30:57.200 align:start position:0%
so hopefully you've got a chance to look
 
00:30:58.950 --> 00:30:58.960 align:start position:0%
at that map because i think
 
00:31:01.029 --> 00:31:01.039 align:start position:0%
that's where our opposition comes from
 
00:31:03.990 --> 00:31:04.000 align:start position:0%
is it makes a major expansion
 
00:31:08.710 --> 00:31:08.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:10.149 --> 00:31:10.159 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of discussion that has to
 
00:31:13.029 --> 00:31:13.039 align:start position:0%
meet four criteria out of 12.
 
00:31:14.630 --> 00:31:14.640 align:start position:0%
i would tell you if you really studied
 
00:31:17.029 --> 00:31:17.039 align:start position:0%
the 12 criteria it's very easy to meet
 
00:31:20.310 --> 00:31:20.320 align:start position:0%
the four the four you know uh even that
 
00:31:21.750 --> 00:31:21.760 align:start position:0%
last one that the representative
 
00:31:24.789 --> 00:31:24.799 align:start position:0%
mentioned uh four is not difficult so
 
00:31:27.750 --> 00:31:27.760 align:start position:0%
that section really it it doesn't
 
00:31:30.630 --> 00:31:30.640 align:start position:0%
but it's really the the line 10 through
 
00:31:34.549 --> 00:31:34.559 align:start position:0%
16 that removes that 50 foot width
 
00:31:38.710 --> 00:31:38.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:38.720 --> 00:31:39.509 align:start position:0%
 
just

00:31:39.509 --> 00:31:39.519 align:start position:0%
just
 
00:31:41.590 --> 00:31:41.600 align:start position:0%
as you take testimony today i want you
 
00:31:41.600 --> 00:31:42.310 align:start position:0%
as you take testimony today i want you
to

00:31:42.310 --> 00:31:42.320 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:31:44.870 --> 00:31:44.880 align:start position:0%
recognize the number of organizations
 
00:31:47.750 --> 00:31:47.760 align:start position:0%
like us and other organizations
 
00:31:49.350 --> 00:31:49.360 align:start position:0%
that have to go through the permit
 
00:31:53.029 --> 00:31:53.039 align:start position:0%
process that oppose this bill
 
00:31:55.029 --> 00:31:55.039 align:start position:0%
i think over the years every time this
 
00:31:56.470 --> 00:31:56.480 align:start position:0%
bill has come up
 
00:31:58.830 --> 00:31:58.840 align:start position:0%
those of us that have to go through this
 
00:32:01.909 --> 00:32:01.919 align:start position:0%
process recognizes the difficulties and
 
00:32:03.750 --> 00:32:03.760 align:start position:0%
have worked with the solutions in the
 
00:32:03.760 --> 00:32:04.870 align:start position:0%
have worked with the solutions in the
past

00:32:04.870 --> 00:32:04.880 align:start position:0%
past
 
00:32:06.870 --> 00:32:06.880 align:start position:0%
we we don't want to reverse what we
 
00:32:10.310 --> 00:32:10.320 align:start position:0%
fixed in 2012.
 
00:32:12.149 --> 00:32:12.159 align:start position:0%
so i just want you to recognize all the
 
00:32:14.310 --> 00:32:14.320 align:start position:0%
organizations that represent groups and
 
00:32:17.269 --> 00:32:17.279 align:start position:0%
the others now the the map clearly shows
 
00:32:20.710 --> 00:32:20.720 align:start position:0%
it would impact uh current landowners
 
00:32:22.710 --> 00:32:22.720 align:start position:0%
in the sense that new delineations and
 
00:32:26.389 --> 00:32:26.399 align:start position:0%
new uh towns could map out additional
 
00:32:28.950 --> 00:32:28.960 align:start position:0%
area if this bill were to pass
 
00:32:30.810 --> 00:32:30.820 align:start position:0%
and i agree with the governor
 
00:32:30.820 --> 00:32:31.909 align:start position:0%
and i agree with the governor
[Music]

00:32:31.909 --> 00:32:31.919 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:32:33.990 --> 00:32:34.000 align:start position:0%
consider a property rights is much
 
00:32:36.070 --> 00:32:36.080 align:start position:0%
different than having the property
 
00:32:38.470 --> 00:32:38.480 align:start position:0%
owner's approval
 
00:32:40.470 --> 00:32:40.480 align:start position:0%
we were involved in some discussions and
 
00:32:42.710 --> 00:32:42.720 align:start position:0%
that's probably a reference that uh the
 
00:32:44.630 --> 00:32:44.640 align:start position:0%
sponsor that this bill
 
00:32:46.950 --> 00:32:46.960 align:start position:0%
uh one of the things we thought is
 
00:32:49.110 --> 00:32:49.120 align:start position:0%
if you're ever going to do this you need
 
00:32:49.120 --> 00:32:50.230 align:start position:0%
if you're ever going to do this you need
landowner

00:32:50.230 --> 00:32:50.240 align:start position:0%
landowner
 
00:32:53.350 --> 00:32:53.360 align:start position:0%
approval not considered uh considered
 
00:32:56.149 --> 00:32:56.159 align:start position:0%
means he's got to fight uh the town if
 
00:32:59.590 --> 00:32:59.600 align:start position:0%
they want to move in this direction
 
00:33:01.590 --> 00:33:01.600 align:start position:0%
this bill just
 
00:33:03.110 --> 00:33:03.120 align:start position:0%
it is really
 
00:33:05.430 --> 00:33:05.440 align:start position:0%
i haven't had any great examples of the
 
00:33:07.029 --> 00:33:07.039 align:start position:0%
reason to do this
 
00:33:09.029 --> 00:33:09.039 align:start position:0%
because i believe
 
00:33:11.669 --> 00:33:11.679 align:start position:0%
that des under its current regulations
 
00:33:14.789 --> 00:33:14.799 align:start position:0%
already protects wetlands
 
00:33:16.789 --> 00:33:16.799 align:start position:0%
we already have statutes that protect
 
00:33:18.230 --> 00:33:18.240 align:start position:0%
the wetlands
 
00:33:19.990 --> 00:33:20.000 align:start position:0%
whether big or small
 
00:33:21.830 --> 00:33:21.840 align:start position:0%
and i think that's adequate and we
 
00:33:23.350 --> 00:33:23.360 align:start position:0%
really haven't had the issue this is
 
00:33:25.029 --> 00:33:25.039 align:start position:0%
really about a fight of adding
 
00:33:27.350 --> 00:33:27.360 align:start position:0%
additional layer of regulation on
 
00:33:29.830 --> 00:33:29.840 align:start position:0%
smaller pieces and uh
 
00:33:32.230 --> 00:33:32.240 align:start position:0%
we definitely oppose this bill i want to
 
00:33:33.590 --> 00:33:33.600 align:start position:0%
thank the chairman and the committee
 
00:33:36.070 --> 00:33:36.080 align:start position:0%

sure i see no questions
 
00:33:46.640 --> 00:33:47.750 align:start position:0%

i guess first and foremost i'd like to
 
00:34:54.710 --> 00:34:54.720 align:start position:0%
thank representative grassy for
 
00:34:56.389 --> 00:34:56.399 align:start position:0%
acknowledging the challenges that the
 
00:34:59.030 --> 00:34:59.040 align:start position:0%
department faces
 
00:35:01.349 --> 00:35:01.359 align:start position:0%
and working with us to incorporate that
 
00:35:03.349 --> 00:35:03.359 align:start position:0%
second part of the the language of the
 
00:35:05.670 --> 00:35:05.680 align:start position:0%
bill um it's very much appreciated and
 
00:35:07.430 --> 00:35:07.440 align:start position:0%
that's really what i'm going to speak to
 
00:35:07.440 --> 00:35:08.470 align:start position:0%
that's really what i'm going to speak to
today

00:35:08.470 --> 00:35:08.480 align:start position:0%
today
 
00:35:10.790 --> 00:35:10.800 align:start position:0%
is not the definition of prime wetlands
 
00:35:13.990 --> 00:35:14.000 align:start position:0%
um leave that for for other scholars but
 
00:35:16.790 --> 00:35:16.800 align:start position:0%
to speak towards the uh the exemption
 
00:35:19.430 --> 00:35:19.440 align:start position:0%
for the department of transportation
 
00:35:21.910 --> 00:35:21.920 align:start position:0%
the bill recognizes that
 
00:35:24.950 --> 00:35:24.960 align:start position:0%
our mission is to maintain the the state
 
00:35:26.470 --> 00:35:26.480 align:start position:0%
highway system
 
00:35:27.670 --> 00:35:27.680 align:start position:0%
and that
 
00:35:29.589 --> 00:35:29.599 align:start position:0%
prime wetlands when they are lo promons
 
00:35:31.589 --> 00:35:31.599 align:start position:0%
and their buffers when they're located
 
00:35:34.069 --> 00:35:34.079 align:start position:0%
within the existing right-of-way
 
00:35:36.630 --> 00:35:36.640 align:start position:0%
to include things like drainage ditches
 
00:35:39.109 --> 00:35:39.119 align:start position:0%
drainage ditches similar areas
 
00:35:40.790 --> 00:35:40.800 align:start position:0%
current law allows maintenance of these
 
00:35:42.470 --> 00:35:42.480 align:start position:0%
ditches without the need for a permit
 
00:35:43.750 --> 00:35:43.760 align:start position:0%
from the department of environmental
 
00:35:43.760 --> 00:35:44.870 align:start position:0%
from the department of environmental
services

00:35:44.870 --> 00:35:44.880 align:start position:0%
services
 
00:35:46.710 --> 00:35:46.720 align:start position:0%
when we're we're cleaning them out for
 
00:35:46.720 --> 00:35:48.790 align:start position:0%
when we're we're cleaning them out for
example

00:35:48.790 --> 00:35:48.800 align:start position:0%
example
 
00:35:50.710 --> 00:35:50.720 align:start position:0%
the prime wetland designation is an
 
00:35:52.950 --> 00:35:52.960 align:start position:0%
option at the local level and once
 
00:35:52.960 --> 00:35:54.550 align:start position:0%
option at the local level and once
designated

00:35:54.550 --> 00:35:54.560 align:start position:0%
designated
 
00:35:57.750 --> 00:35:57.760 align:start position:0%
applies also to state agencies
 
00:36:00.710 --> 00:36:00.720 align:start position:0%
in many cases the highways existed prior
 
00:36:02.870 --> 00:36:02.880 align:start position:0%
to the prime wetland designations that
 
00:36:06.550 --> 00:36:06.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:07.990 --> 00:36:08.000 align:start position:0%
when when located within the
 
00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:09.190 align:start position:0%
when when located within the
right-of-way

00:36:09.190 --> 00:36:09.200 align:start position:0%
right-of-way
 
00:36:11.910 --> 00:36:11.920 align:start position:0%
maintenance can be unduly impacted by
 
00:36:13.910 --> 00:36:13.920 align:start position:0%
the prime wetland designation as well as
 
00:36:15.990 --> 00:36:16.000 align:start position:0%
the buffer
 
00:36:17.589 --> 00:36:17.599 align:start position:0%
for example i think representative
 
00:36:19.190 --> 00:36:19.200 align:start position:0%
grassy pointed this out as well that
 
00:36:21.670 --> 00:36:21.680 align:start position:0%
when fixing a pipe for example or adding
 
00:36:25.030 --> 00:36:25.040 align:start position:0%
a shoulder replacing a guard rail
 
00:36:27.750 --> 00:36:27.760 align:start position:0%
it may require
 
00:36:30.069 --> 00:36:30.079 align:start position:0%
additional justification or mitigation
 
00:36:32.870 --> 00:36:32.880 align:start position:0%
etc when the work is located within the
 
00:36:35.750 --> 00:36:35.760 align:start position:0%
boundary of the buffer or prime wetland
 
00:36:35.760 --> 00:36:36.630 align:start position:0%
boundary of the buffer or prime wetland
those

00:36:36.630 --> 00:36:36.640 align:start position:0%
those
 
00:36:38.870 --> 00:36:38.880 align:start position:0%
those maintenance activities if they do
 
00:36:41.030 --> 00:36:41.040 align:start position:0%
impact wetlands already as has been
 
00:36:43.190 --> 00:36:43.200 align:start position:0%
pointed out before there are existing
 
00:36:46.150 --> 00:36:46.160 align:start position:0%
statutes and rules that that
 
00:36:48.630 --> 00:36:48.640 align:start position:0%
that tell us we have to get permits
 
00:36:50.390 --> 00:36:50.400 align:start position:0%
but the the buffer especially is
 
00:36:54.470 --> 00:36:54.480 align:start position:0%
something that does add a bit more uh
 
00:36:56.470 --> 00:36:56.480 align:start position:0%
is a bit more onerous for the department
 
00:36:57.829 --> 00:36:57.839 align:start position:0%
especially when
 
00:36:59.990 --> 00:37:00.000 align:start position:0%
um simply maintaining what's already
 
00:37:01.190 --> 00:37:01.200 align:start position:0%
there so
 
00:37:01.200 --> 00:37:03.030 align:start position:0%
there so
um

00:37:03.030 --> 00:37:03.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:37:05.829 --> 00:37:05.839 align:start position:0%
i guess lastly in finalizing that it's
 
00:37:08.390 --> 00:37:08.400 align:start position:0%
my understanding that the dot
 
00:37:10.630 --> 00:37:10.640 align:start position:0%
would not have to require
 
00:37:11.829 --> 00:37:11.839 align:start position:0%
be required to adhere to these
 
00:37:13.510 --> 00:37:13.520 align:start position:0%
additional requirements within the
 
00:37:13.520 --> 00:37:14.710 align:start position:0%
additional requirements within the
existing

00:37:14.710 --> 00:37:14.720 align:start position:0%
existing
 
00:37:17.109 --> 00:37:17.119 align:start position:0%
uh right of way for with existing
 
00:37:19.510 --> 00:37:19.520 align:start position:0%
designated prime wetlands so i just like
 
00:37:21.430 --> 00:37:21.440 align:start position:0%
to make sure that i i raise that as well
 
00:37:21.440 --> 00:37:22.630 align:start position:0%
to make sure that i i raise that as well
so

00:37:22.630 --> 00:37:22.640 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:37:24.150 --> 00:37:24.160 align:start position:0%
that's all i have and i'm happy to
 
00:37:27.670 --> 00:37:27.680 align:start position:0%
answer any questions that you might have
 
00:37:29.030 --> 00:37:29.040 align:start position:0%
any questions but members of the
 
00:37:29.040 --> 00:37:31.430 align:start position:0%
any questions but members of the
committee

00:37:31.430 --> 00:37:31.440 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:37:33.270 --> 00:37:33.280 align:start position:0%
sir i see no questions
 
00:37:34.950 --> 00:37:34.960 align:start position:0%
uh there being no questions thank you
 
00:37:38.230 --> 00:37:38.240 align:start position:0%
very much for your testimony thank you
 
00:37:43.589 --> 00:37:43.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:48.310 --> 00:37:48.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:50.790 --> 00:37:50.800 align:start position:0%
harold cook in
 
00:37:50.800 --> 00:37:53.030 align:start position:0%
harold cook in
opposition

00:37:53.030 --> 00:37:53.040 align:start position:0%
opposition
 
00:38:00.470 --> 00:38:00.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:03.510 --> 00:38:03.520 align:start position:0%
is he there yes sir he's any at
 
00:38:06.390 --> 00:38:06.400 align:start position:0%
mr cook could you unmute yourself and
 
00:38:08.150 --> 00:38:08.160 align:start position:0%
turn on the video if he's got it and you
 
00:38:14.710 --> 00:38:14.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:18.230 --> 00:38:18.240 align:start position:0%
doesn't seem to be working
 
00:38:23.030 --> 00:38:23.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:24.390 --> 00:38:24.400 align:start position:0%
mr chairman
 
00:38:27.190 --> 00:38:27.200 align:start position:0%
mr cook no i'm sorry this is uh uh kevin
 
00:38:29.510 --> 00:38:29.520 align:start position:0%
9 from the dot again i just would like
 
00:38:29.520 --> 00:38:30.630 align:start position:0%
9 from the dot again i just would like
to

00:38:30.630 --> 00:38:30.640 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:38:32.710 --> 00:38:32.720 align:start position:0%
to say that when i did
 
00:38:35.030 --> 00:38:35.040 align:start position:0%
um when i was authorized to join the
 
00:38:37.190 --> 00:38:37.200 align:start position:0%
meeting it did take a second or two for
 
00:38:38.790 --> 00:38:38.800 align:start position:0%
it looked like the system turned off and
 
00:38:41.589 --> 00:38:41.599 align:start position:0%
on so there may be a delay just uh just
 
00:38:43.750 --> 00:38:43.760 align:start position:0%
so you know that's promoting him to
 
00:38:46.150 --> 00:38:46.160 align:start position:0%
panelists okay yeah we have to i guess
 
00:38:48.069 --> 00:38:48.079 align:start position:0%
promoted to panelists
 
00:38:50.710 --> 00:38:50.720 align:start position:0%
to be able to see him so cook was on and
 
00:38:53.030 --> 00:38:53.040 align:start position:0%
now he's gone i don't know
 
00:38:56.790 --> 00:38:56.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:59.030 --> 00:38:59.040 align:start position:0%
if that'll we'll i'll go on and we'll
 
00:39:00.470 --> 00:39:00.480 align:start position:0%
try to get
 
00:39:13.109 --> 00:39:13.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:15.670 --> 00:39:15.680 align:start position:0%
so can we come back to him
 
00:39:18.630 --> 00:39:18.640 align:start position:0%
we can see him he needs to unmute
 
00:39:21.589 --> 00:39:21.599 align:start position:0%
no there he is he's back i got him is he
 
00:39:24.390 --> 00:39:24.400 align:start position:0%
there it's the club he's on the inside

i would like to thank everyone for
 
00:40:32.710 --> 00:40:32.720 align:start position:0%
giving me the chance to speak to the
 
00:40:34.349 --> 00:40:34.359 align:start position:0%
issue of house bill
 
00:40:39.589 --> 00:40:39.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:41.670 --> 00:40:41.680 align:start position:0%
i have been a land owner for over 50
 
00:40:41.680 --> 00:40:42.790 align:start position:0%
i have been a land owner for over 50
years

00:40:42.790 --> 00:40:42.800 align:start position:0%
years
 
00:40:45.030 --> 00:40:45.040 align:start position:0%
my work consists mostly of working with
 
00:40:46.790 --> 00:40:46.800 align:start position:0%
private land owners managing the
 
00:40:48.870 --> 00:40:48.880 align:start position:0%
timberland for a whole host
 
00:40:51.270 --> 00:40:51.280 align:start position:0%
of reasons some of which include
 
00:40:52.870 --> 00:40:52.880 align:start position:0%
the production of
 
00:40:52.880 --> 00:40:55.109 align:start position:0%
the production of
timber

00:40:55.109 --> 00:40:55.119 align:start position:0%
timber
 
00:40:57.270 --> 00:40:57.280 align:start position:0%
recreation wildlife
 
00:40:59.510 --> 00:40:59.520 align:start position:0%
and sometimes just passive enjoyment
 
00:41:01.270 --> 00:41:01.280 align:start position:0%
which we can all understand in these
 
00:41:03.349 --> 00:41:03.359 align:start position:0%
days i'm sure
 
00:41:05.109 --> 00:41:05.119 align:start position:0%
over the years we have managed several
 
00:41:08.150 --> 00:41:08.160 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand acres
 
00:41:10.069 --> 00:41:10.079 align:start position:0%
from one end of the state to the other
 
00:41:12.390 --> 00:41:12.400 align:start position:0%
as well as land in other northeastern
 
00:41:12.400 --> 00:41:13.990 align:start position:0%
as well as land in other northeastern
states

00:41:13.990 --> 00:41:14.000 align:start position:0%
states
 
00:41:16.230 --> 00:41:16.240 align:start position:0%
prime wetlands is a dramatic word that
 
00:41:18.710 --> 00:41:18.720 align:start position:0%
implies that our wetlands are not being
 
00:41:23.589 --> 00:41:23.599 align:start position:0%
protected if house bill 158 passes will
 
00:41:25.670 --> 00:41:25.680 align:start position:0%
have a devastating effect
 
00:41:28.710 --> 00:41:28.720 align:start position:0%
on the forest industry in new hampshire
 
00:41:30.790 --> 00:41:30.800 align:start position:0%
the quilted patent of environmental
 
00:41:34.230 --> 00:41:34.240 align:start position:0%
regulations protecting our land water in
 
00:41:37.670 --> 00:41:37.680 align:start position:0%
the overall forest and has been
 
00:41:39.670 --> 00:41:39.680 align:start position:0%
more than adequate to protect our
 
00:41:41.910 --> 00:41:41.920 align:start position:0%
natural resources and all the components
 
00:41:46.230 --> 00:41:46.240 align:start position:0%
that make it viable economic resource
 
00:41:48.390 --> 00:41:48.400 align:start position:0%
to file an application on the prime
 
00:41:48.400 --> 00:41:49.589 align:start position:0%
to file an application on the prime
wetlands

00:41:49.589 --> 00:41:49.599 align:start position:0%
wetlands
 
00:41:51.829 --> 00:41:51.839 align:start position:0%
requires a public hearing
 
00:41:54.390 --> 00:41:54.400 align:start position:0%
in multiple hoops through which multiple
 
00:41:57.270 --> 00:41:57.280 align:start position:0%
organizations and individuals local and
 
00:41:57.280 --> 00:42:00.309 align:start position:0%
organizations and individuals local and
otherwise

00:42:00.309 --> 00:42:00.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:00.319 --> 00:42:07.750 align:start position:0%
 
uh

00:42:07.750 --> 00:42:07.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:10.870 --> 00:42:10.880 align:start position:0%
the prime wetlands uh is a complicated
 
00:42:13.190 --> 00:42:13.200 align:start position:0%
already and working process and
 
00:42:15.589 --> 00:42:15.599 align:start position:0%
duplicates effort as it applies to
 
00:42:18.470 --> 00:42:18.480 align:start position:0%
managing timberlands
 
00:42:21.750 --> 00:42:21.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:23.910 --> 00:42:23.920 align:start position:0%
the initial thought that i had when i
 
00:42:26.150 --> 00:42:26.160 align:start position:0%
saw this come up
 
00:42:28.390 --> 00:42:28.400 align:start position:0%
a while back
 
00:42:31.270 --> 00:42:31.280 align:start position:0%
is that just another name
 
00:42:35.030 --> 00:42:35.040 align:start position:0%
for eminent domain in the taking of land
 
00:42:37.190 --> 00:42:37.200 align:start position:0%
and quite honestly i would like to say i
 
00:42:38.950 --> 00:42:38.960 align:start position:0%
just hope
 
00:42:41.270 --> 00:42:41.280 align:start position:0%
that you oppose this bill it is
 
00:42:41.280 --> 00:42:42.710 align:start position:0%
that you oppose this bill it is
unnecessary

00:42:42.710 --> 00:42:42.720 align:start position:0%
unnecessary
 
00:42:45.030 --> 00:42:45.040 align:start position:0%
and i would like to show you one thing
 
00:42:47.190 --> 00:42:47.200 align:start position:0%
that the forest community
 
00:42:49.829 --> 00:42:49.839 align:start position:0%
lives by on a daily basis
 
00:42:52.309 --> 00:42:52.319 align:start position:0%
it's good forestry in the granite state
 
00:42:54.230 --> 00:42:54.240 align:start position:0%
which is a recent publication within the
 
00:42:55.750 --> 00:42:55.760 align:start position:0%
last few years
 
00:42:57.750 --> 00:42:57.760 align:start position:0%
and it covers just about all of our
 
00:42:59.510 --> 00:42:59.520 align:start position:0%
wetlands in timberland in the state of
 
00:43:01.270 --> 00:43:01.280 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
00:43:04.710 --> 00:43:04.720 align:start position:0%
thank you that's all i have to say
 
00:43:07.910 --> 00:43:07.920 align:start position:0%
thank you very much is there any any uh
 
00:43:10.230 --> 00:43:10.240 align:start position:0%
any member of the committee have a
 
00:43:10.240 --> 00:43:11.270 align:start position:0%
any member of the committee have a
question

00:43:11.270 --> 00:43:11.280 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:43:13.510 --> 00:43:13.520 align:start position:0%
for mr cook
 
00:43:15.670 --> 00:43:15.680 align:start position:0%
sir i see no questions there being no
 
00:43:17.109 --> 00:43:17.119 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much for your
 
00:43:28.390 --> 00:43:28.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:31.510 --> 00:43:31.520 align:start position:0%
i think uh uh i'm trying my hope
 
00:43:33.750 --> 00:43:33.760 align:start position:0%
going back we're trying to go
 
00:43:33.760 --> 00:43:35.349 align:start position:0%
going back we're trying to go
uh

00:43:35.349 --> 00:43:35.359 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:43:36.790 --> 00:43:36.800 align:start position:0%
for and against
 
00:43:36.800 --> 00:43:37.589 align:start position:0%
for and against
uh

00:43:37.589 --> 00:43:37.599 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:43:40.470 --> 00:43:40.480 align:start position:0%
so i will recognize
 
00:43:43.109 --> 00:43:43.119 align:start position:0%
barbara richter representing the
 
00:43:45.510 --> 00:43:45.520 align:start position:0%
new hampshire association of
 
00:43:48.470 --> 00:43:48.480 align:start position:0%
conservation commissions
 
00:43:54.069 --> 00:43:54.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:57.589 --> 00:43:57.599 align:start position:0%
barbara richter yes hello thank you
 
00:43:58.790 --> 00:43:58.800 align:start position:0%
for um
 
00:43:59.829 --> 00:43:59.839 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:44:01.990 --> 00:44:02.000 align:start position:0%
opportunity to testify my name is
 
00:44:03.750 --> 00:44:03.760 align:start position:0%
barbara richter i'm the executive
 
00:44:05.190 --> 00:44:05.200 align:start position:0%
director of the new hampshire
 
00:44:10.069 --> 00:44:10.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:11.430 --> 00:44:11.440 align:start position:0%
for those of you don't know the new
 
00:44:13.270 --> 00:44:13.280 align:start position:0%
hampshire association of conservation
 
00:44:15.589 --> 00:44:15.599 align:start position:0%
commissions is a non-profit organization
 
00:44:16.870 --> 00:44:16.880 align:start position:0%
that serves
 
00:44:19.750 --> 00:44:19.760 align:start position:0%
our 217 conservation commissions here in
 
00:44:21.589 --> 00:44:21.599 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
00:44:24.309 --> 00:44:24.319 align:start position:0%
the nhacc board of directors supports
 
00:44:27.349 --> 00:44:27.359 align:start position:0%
house bill 158 to further define the
 
00:44:31.589 --> 00:44:31.599 align:start position:0%
prime wetlands to include these narrow
 
00:44:33.510 --> 00:44:33.520 align:start position:0%
narrow fingers
 
00:44:35.109 --> 00:44:35.119 align:start position:0%
when they provide a
 
00:44:37.349 --> 00:44:37.359 align:start position:0%
significant contribution to the prime
 
00:44:37.359 --> 00:44:38.550 align:start position:0%
significant contribution to the prime
wetlands

00:44:38.550 --> 00:44:38.560 align:start position:0%
wetlands
 
00:44:38.560 --> 00:44:39.430 align:start position:0%
wetlands
um

00:44:39.430 --> 00:44:39.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:44:40.950 --> 00:44:40.960 align:start position:0%
i just want to point out that this is a
 
00:44:43.109 --> 00:44:43.119 align:start position:0%
voluntary program
 
00:44:45.670 --> 00:44:45.680 align:start position:0%
and currently we have about 33 towns
 
00:44:47.910 --> 00:44:47.920 align:start position:0%
that do this so it's not
 
00:44:49.670 --> 00:44:49.680 align:start position:0%
going to cover the entire state we're
 
00:44:52.150 --> 00:44:52.160 align:start position:0%
not blanketing the entire state with um
 
00:44:54.630 --> 00:44:54.640 align:start position:0%
these small fingers of wetlands to be
 
00:44:56.630 --> 00:44:56.640 align:start position:0%
included it's it's a very rigorous
 
00:44:58.550 --> 00:44:58.560 align:start position:0%
process to go through
 
00:45:00.309 --> 00:45:00.319 align:start position:0%
and i can give you that quick background
 
00:45:00.319 --> 00:45:01.190 align:start position:0%
and i can give you that quick background
although

00:45:01.190 --> 00:45:01.200 align:start position:0%
although
 
00:45:03.510 --> 00:45:03.520 align:start position:0%
representative grassy did a good job but
 
00:45:05.990 --> 00:45:06.000 align:start position:0%
it's under rsa 482 conservation
 
00:45:08.390 --> 00:45:08.400 align:start position:0%
commissions may select areas to
 
00:45:11.430 --> 00:45:11.440 align:start position:0%
designate as prime wetlands
 
00:45:14.150 --> 00:45:14.160 align:start position:0%
um and they prime what prime wetlands
 
00:45:15.910 --> 00:45:15.920 align:start position:0%
are selected
 
00:45:17.990 --> 00:45:18.000 align:start position:0%
because they are they have significant
 
00:45:20.550 --> 00:45:20.560 align:start position:0%
value and functions um because of their
 
00:45:22.950 --> 00:45:22.960 align:start position:0%
size unspoiled character fragile
 
00:45:25.349 --> 00:45:25.359 align:start position:0%
condition or other factors that make
 
00:45:27.510 --> 00:45:27.520 align:start position:0%
them significant so we're not talking
 
00:45:30.069 --> 00:45:30.079 align:start position:0%
you know the ditches and and other areas
 
00:45:32.790 --> 00:45:32.800 align:start position:0%
that don't have those that don't meet
 
00:45:35.030 --> 00:45:35.040 align:start position:0%
the criteria
 
00:45:37.349 --> 00:45:37.359 align:start position:0%
this is a very thoughtful process it
 
00:45:39.750 --> 00:45:39.760 align:start position:0%
involves the whole community as we
 
00:45:41.589 --> 00:45:41.599 align:start position:0%
talked about
 
00:45:43.990 --> 00:45:44.000 align:start position:0%
a report is prepared by a professional
 
00:45:47.430 --> 00:45:47.440 align:start position:0%
certified wetland scientist
 
00:45:50.230 --> 00:45:50.240 align:start position:0%
and it involves careful review with both
 
00:45:52.150 --> 00:45:52.160 align:start position:0%
conservation commissions as well as
 
00:45:55.430 --> 00:45:55.440 align:start position:0%
other town boards and it also involves a
 
00:45:58.230 --> 00:45:58.240 align:start position:0%
public hearing and town vote so it's not
 
00:46:00.950 --> 00:46:00.960 align:start position:0%
an easy process and again if it were so
 
00:46:02.790 --> 00:46:02.800 align:start position:0%
easy we'd certainly have more than the
 
00:46:06.069 --> 00:46:06.079 align:start position:0%
33 towns that currently do have prime
 
00:46:08.550 --> 00:46:08.560 align:start position:0%
wetlands and i know of many towns that
 
00:46:11.190 --> 00:46:11.200 align:start position:0%
would like to have the opportunity to
 
00:46:13.270 --> 00:46:13.280 align:start position:0%
have these fingers included and they're
 
00:46:15.750 --> 00:46:15.760 align:start position:0%
kind of holding off right now
 
00:46:18.390 --> 00:46:18.400 align:start position:0%
in in applying for this designation
 
00:46:19.910 --> 00:46:19.920 align:start position:0%
until they can
 
00:46:21.990 --> 00:46:22.000 align:start position:0%
include some of these really special
 
00:46:23.910 --> 00:46:23.920 align:start position:0%
unique areas
 
00:46:26.790 --> 00:46:26.800 align:start position:0%
um again it's des that does the final
 
00:46:29.670 --> 00:46:29.680 align:start position:0%
designation of those wetlands so it's
 
00:46:31.670 --> 00:46:31.680 align:start position:0%
review on the local level and review on
 
00:46:34.230 --> 00:46:34.240 align:start position:0%
the state level
 
00:46:34.240 --> 00:46:35.430 align:start position:0%
the state level
so

00:46:35.430 --> 00:46:35.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:46:35.440 --> 00:46:37.270 align:start position:0%
so
the

00:46:37.270 --> 00:46:37.280 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:46:38.630 --> 00:46:38.640 align:start position:0%
one of the
 
00:46:39.990 --> 00:46:40.000 align:start position:0%
things that we've talked about is prime
 
00:46:42.710 --> 00:46:42.720 align:start position:0%
wetland designation allows for more
 
00:46:44.390 --> 00:46:44.400 align:start position:0%
local control
 
00:46:46.950 --> 00:46:46.960 align:start position:0%
and a more complete review
 
00:46:46.960 --> 00:46:47.910 align:start position:0%
and a more complete review
than

00:46:47.910 --> 00:46:47.920 align:start position:0%
than
 
00:46:49.270 --> 00:46:49.280 align:start position:0%
when you are dealing with a dredge and
 
00:46:51.750 --> 00:46:51.760 align:start position:0%
fill permit on the state level and again
 
00:46:54.150 --> 00:46:54.160 align:start position:0%
it does slow things down a bit but this
 
00:46:56.390 --> 00:46:56.400 align:start position:0%
is an area where we believe you should
 
00:46:58.790 --> 00:46:58.800 align:start position:0%
have a more thorough um
 
00:47:01.510 --> 00:47:01.520 align:start position:0%
and transparent review
 
00:47:03.670 --> 00:47:03.680 align:start position:0%
so that municipalities can really ensure
 
00:47:05.910 --> 00:47:05.920 align:start position:0%
that there these are the um
 
00:47:07.829 --> 00:47:07.839 align:start position:0%
it's at the best level of protection for
 
00:47:14.230 --> 00:47:14.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:16.550 --> 00:47:16.560 align:start position:0%
so i'm going to skip skip through a bit
 
00:47:18.150 --> 00:47:18.160 align:start position:0%
because a lot of testimony has already
 
00:47:19.990 --> 00:47:20.000 align:start position:0%
been given but
 
00:47:21.670 --> 00:47:21.680 align:start position:0%
prime wetlands
 
00:47:24.069 --> 00:47:24.079 align:start position:0%
have high functions and values which is
 
00:47:27.030 --> 00:47:27.040 align:start position:0%
again why they are carefully regulated
 
00:47:29.030 --> 00:47:29.040 align:start position:0%
wetlands provide critical functions
 
00:47:31.030 --> 00:47:31.040 align:start position:0%
including flood control groundwater
 
00:47:33.270 --> 00:47:33.280 align:start position:0%
recharge water quality maintenance
 
00:47:35.670 --> 00:47:35.680 align:start position:0%
through pollution filtration wildlife
 
00:47:35.680 --> 00:47:37.190 align:start position:0%
through pollution filtration wildlife
habitat

00:47:37.190 --> 00:47:37.200 align:start position:0%
habitat
 
00:47:39.270 --> 00:47:39.280 align:start position:0%
shoreland stabilization and these are
 
00:47:41.109 --> 00:47:41.119 align:start position:0%
all things that are really important as
 
00:47:43.829 --> 00:47:43.839 align:start position:0%
new hampshire continues to grow
 
00:47:45.750 --> 00:47:45.760 align:start position:0%
and more and more development is is
 
00:47:50.630 --> 00:47:50.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:52.390 --> 00:47:52.400 align:start position:0%
and it's important to also note that
 
00:47:55.030 --> 00:47:55.040 align:start position:0%
often these highest values lie in these
 
00:47:57.270 --> 00:47:57.280 align:start position:0%
poorly drained areas where the narrow
 
00:47:59.109 --> 00:47:59.119 align:start position:0%
fingers go stretch out into the
 
00:47:59.119 --> 00:48:00.550 align:start position:0%
fingers go stretch out into the
landscape

00:48:00.550 --> 00:48:00.560 align:start position:0%
landscape
 
00:48:00.560 --> 00:48:01.510 align:start position:0%
landscape
um

00:48:01.510 --> 00:48:01.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:48:03.430 --> 00:48:03.440 align:start position:0%
the existing law does not take into
 
00:48:05.190 --> 00:48:05.200 align:start position:0%
account these wetlands that are less
 
00:48:06.710 --> 00:48:06.720 align:start position:0%
than 50 feet
 
00:48:09.750 --> 00:48:09.760 align:start position:0%
and it cuts off the wetland complex
 
00:48:12.230 --> 00:48:12.240 align:start position:0%
and we've certainly found that
 
00:48:14.550 --> 00:48:14.560 align:start position:0%
keeping the wetland as a whole is one of
 
00:48:16.790 --> 00:48:16.800 align:start position:0%
the best ways to protect
 
00:48:19.190 --> 00:48:19.200 align:start position:0%
the overall water resources
 
00:48:19.200 --> 00:48:20.870 align:start position:0%
the overall water resources
and

00:48:20.870 --> 00:48:20.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:48:24.150 --> 00:48:24.160 align:start position:0%
house bill 158 would further define law
 
00:48:26.630 --> 00:48:26.640 align:start position:0%
to include these narrow portions and
 
00:48:28.950 --> 00:48:28.960 align:start position:0%
again it's only if the municipality can
 
00:48:31.589 --> 00:48:31.599 align:start position:0%
demonstrate that such narrower portions
 
00:48:34.230 --> 00:48:34.240 align:start position:0%
provide a significant contribution to
 
00:48:36.710 --> 00:48:36.720 align:start position:0%
the primary wetlands functions of the
 
00:48:38.790 --> 00:48:38.800 align:start position:0%
prime wetlands so again it's not just
 
00:48:40.470 --> 00:48:40.480 align:start position:0%
every finger and toe out there they
 
00:48:42.470 --> 00:48:42.480 align:start position:0%
really have to demonstrate their
 
00:48:42.480 --> 00:48:44.470 align:start position:0%
really have to demonstrate their
significance

00:48:44.470 --> 00:48:44.480 align:start position:0%
significance
 
00:48:47.670 --> 00:48:47.680 align:start position:0%
so again this change would really um
 
00:48:49.670 --> 00:48:49.680 align:start position:0%
allow for wetland protections on a
 
00:48:52.630 --> 00:48:52.640 align:start position:0%
larger wetland complex and that better
 
00:48:56.390 --> 00:48:56.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:58.390 --> 00:48:58.400 align:start position:0%
these functions and values provide a
 
00:49:00.950 --> 00:49:00.960 align:start position:0%
multitude of public benefits so i think
 
00:49:02.870 --> 00:49:02.880 align:start position:0%
that's something it's tough to balance
 
00:49:04.870 --> 00:49:04.880 align:start position:0%
your private benefit and your public
 
00:49:04.880 --> 00:49:05.829 align:start position:0%
your private benefit and your public
benefit

00:49:05.829 --> 00:49:05.839 align:start position:0%
benefit
 
00:49:05.839 --> 00:49:06.950 align:start position:0%
benefit
but

00:49:06.950 --> 00:49:06.960 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:49:09.109 --> 00:49:09.119 align:start position:0%
again water quality
 
00:49:12.150 --> 00:49:12.160 align:start position:0%
shore stabilization pollution filtration
 
00:49:13.990 --> 00:49:14.000 align:start position:0%
are all really really important public
 
00:49:16.870 --> 00:49:16.880 align:start position:0%
benefits that need to be considered
 
00:49:16.880 --> 00:49:17.829 align:start position:0%
benefits that need to be considered
and

00:49:17.829 --> 00:49:17.839 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:49:19.910 --> 00:49:19.920 align:start position:0%
these wetlands perform their critical
 
00:49:21.829 --> 00:49:21.839 align:start position:0%
functions best when they're connected
 
00:49:24.470 --> 00:49:24.480 align:start position:0%
across the landscape so providing these
 
00:49:26.950 --> 00:49:26.960 align:start position:0%
fingers and toes will really enhance
 
00:49:28.829 --> 00:49:28.839 align:start position:0%
those values
 
00:49:28.839 --> 00:49:30.790 align:start position:0%
those values
um

00:49:30.790 --> 00:49:30.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:49:33.670 --> 00:49:33.680 align:start position:0%
though impacts to a wetland um complex
 
00:49:35.990 --> 00:49:36.000 align:start position:0%
they're felt downstream and so if you
 
00:49:38.150 --> 00:49:38.160 align:start position:0%
are impacting some of these upland
 
00:49:40.309 --> 00:49:40.319 align:start position:0%
fingers and toes it's going to affect
 
00:49:45.430 --> 00:49:45.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:48.230 --> 00:49:48.240 align:start position:0%
and one thing one quick note to think
 
00:49:48.240 --> 00:49:50.230 align:start position:0%
and one thing one quick note to think
about

00:49:50.230 --> 00:49:50.240 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:49:52.309 --> 00:49:52.319 align:start position:0%
with climate change looming and on
 
00:49:54.230 --> 00:49:54.240 align:start position:0%
everybody's minds these days new
 
00:49:56.069 --> 00:49:56.079 align:start position:0%
hampshire is going to be one of those
 
00:49:58.790 --> 00:49:58.800 align:start position:0%
areas where people will migrate to
 
00:50:00.390 --> 00:50:00.400 align:start position:0%
because our climate
 
00:50:02.390 --> 00:50:02.400 align:start position:0%
and we will be um
 
00:50:04.870 --> 00:50:04.880 align:start position:0%
you know will be affected less perhaps
 
00:50:07.109 --> 00:50:07.119 align:start position:0%
and we have water resources
 
00:50:07.119 --> 00:50:07.910 align:start position:0%
and we have water resources
so

00:50:07.910 --> 00:50:07.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:50:09.349 --> 00:50:09.359 align:start position:0%
there will be a lot of development
 
00:50:11.349 --> 00:50:11.359 align:start position:0%
pressure coming in the future
 
00:50:13.349 --> 00:50:13.359 align:start position:0%
so it's important to really carefully
 
00:50:13.359 --> 00:50:14.470 align:start position:0%
so it's important to really carefully
review

00:50:14.470 --> 00:50:14.480 align:start position:0%
review
 
00:50:16.710 --> 00:50:16.720 align:start position:0%
our natural resources like our wetlands
 
00:50:18.710 --> 00:50:18.720 align:start position:0%
before they're built and this would
 
00:50:21.910 --> 00:50:21.920 align:start position:0%
provide that opportunity and again it's
 
00:50:24.630 --> 00:50:24.640 align:start position:0%
a voluntary thing the towns need to
 
00:50:27.109 --> 00:50:27.119 align:start position:0%
instigate this the towns need to prove
 
00:50:29.109 --> 00:50:29.119 align:start position:0%
and demonstrate that they're prime
 
00:50:31.750 --> 00:50:31.760 align:start position:0%
wetlands so it's not going to be every
 
00:50:34.069 --> 00:50:34.079 align:start position:0%
single wetland out there so again please
 
00:50:36.309 --> 00:50:36.319 align:start position:0%
help conservation commissions continue
 
00:50:38.390 --> 00:50:38.400 align:start position:0%
to protect new hampshire's natural
 
00:50:40.870 --> 00:50:40.880 align:start position:0%
resources and our water resources
 
00:50:43.829 --> 00:50:43.839 align:start position:0%
please vote yes on house bill 158 to
 
00:50:45.910 --> 00:50:45.920 align:start position:0%
allow for these narrow portions to be
 
00:50:48.309 --> 00:50:48.319 align:start position:0%
included in the definition of prime
 
00:50:50.549 --> 00:50:50.559 align:start position:0%
wetlands so thank you very much for this
 
00:50:52.470 --> 00:50:52.480 align:start position:0%
opportunity and i'm happy to answer any
 
00:50:55.109 --> 00:50:55.119 align:start position:0%
questions you may have
 
00:50:57.349 --> 00:50:57.359 align:start position:0%
again is there any questions from the
 
00:51:00.150 --> 00:51:00.160 align:start position:0%
members of the committee
 
00:51:02.390 --> 00:51:02.400 align:start position:0%
sir i see no questions if not thank you
 
00:51:04.630 --> 00:51:04.640 align:start position:0%
very much for your testimony
 
00:51:04.640 --> 00:51:06.309 align:start position:0%
very much for your testimony
uh

00:51:06.309 --> 00:51:06.319 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:51:09.109 --> 00:51:09.119 align:start position:0%
i'm going to start holding now to the
 
00:51:09.119 --> 00:51:10.710 align:start position:0%
i'm going to start holding now to the
time

00:51:10.710 --> 00:51:10.720 align:start position:0%
time
 
00:51:10.720 --> 00:51:12.870 align:start position:0%
time
limitations

00:51:12.870 --> 00:51:12.880 align:start position:0%
limitations
 
00:51:14.549 --> 00:51:14.559 align:start position:0%
and people put three minutes down i
 
00:51:14.559 --> 00:51:15.750 align:start position:0%
and people put three minutes down i
expect

00:51:15.750 --> 00:51:15.760 align:start position:0%
expect
 
00:51:16.870 --> 00:51:16.880 align:start position:0%
that three
 
00:51:20.630 --> 00:51:20.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:22.630 --> 00:51:22.640 align:start position:0%

our members own and manage over a
 
00:52:36.710 --> 00:52:36.720 align:start position:0%
million acres in the state of new

hampshire
 
00:52:40.790 --> 00:52:40.800 align:start position:0%
as you heard from harold cook earlier
 
00:52:42.790 --> 00:52:42.800 align:start position:0%
they managed for a host of reasons
 
00:52:42.800 --> 00:52:43.750 align:start position:0%
they managed for a host of reasons
timber

00:52:43.750 --> 00:52:43.760 align:start position:0%
timber
 
00:52:43.760 --> 00:52:44.829 align:start position:0%
timber
wildlife

00:52:44.829 --> 00:52:44.839 align:start position:0%
wildlife
 
00:52:46.790 --> 00:52:46.800 align:start position:0%
recreation um
 
00:52:49.349 --> 00:52:49.359 align:start position:0%
we're i'm here to voice our opposition
 
00:52:53.030 --> 00:52:53.040 align:start position:0%
to house bill 158
 
00:52:54.549 --> 00:52:54.559 align:start position:0%
prime wetlands
 
00:52:55.910 --> 00:52:55.920 align:start position:0%
you know it's
 
00:52:57.510 --> 00:52:57.520 align:start position:0%
crime wetlands
 
00:53:00.230 --> 00:53:00.240 align:start position:0%
in those 33 communities where there are
 
00:53:02.790 --> 00:53:02.800 align:start position:0%
prime wetlands if you're doing forestry
 
00:53:04.710 --> 00:53:04.720 align:start position:0%
in or around them
 
00:53:07.750 --> 00:53:07.760 align:start position:0%
they can significantly hinder and in
 
00:53:09.109 --> 00:53:09.119 align:start position:0%
some cases
 
00:53:11.190 --> 00:53:11.200 align:start position:0%
create enough of a barrier that entire
 
00:53:13.750 --> 00:53:13.760 align:start position:0%
timber sales get shelved
 
00:53:15.829 --> 00:53:15.839 align:start position:0%
just because there is
 
00:53:17.750 --> 00:53:17.760 align:start position:0%
you know it was it was characterized as
 
00:53:20.069 --> 00:53:20.079 align:start position:0%
well it's it's a little more extra work
 
00:53:22.790 --> 00:53:22.800 align:start position:0%
it's a little bit of extra paperwork
 
00:53:24.390 --> 00:53:24.400 align:start position:0%
well you know
 
00:53:26.790 --> 00:53:26.800 align:start position:0%
in the forestry world the additional
 
00:53:29.270 --> 00:53:29.280 align:start position:0%
requirements that come with a prime
 
00:53:31.190 --> 00:53:31.200 align:start position:0%
wetlands managing in and around the
 
00:53:32.870 --> 00:53:32.880 align:start position:0%
prime wetlands even if you're going to
 
00:53:34.870 --> 00:53:34.880 align:start position:0%
use the waiver process
 
00:53:37.349 --> 00:53:37.359 align:start position:0%
they are significant enough that they
 
00:53:39.270 --> 00:53:39.280 align:start position:0%
can um
 
00:53:42.390 --> 00:53:42.400 align:start position:0%
they can scuttle a a timber sale
 
00:53:42.400 --> 00:53:43.270 align:start position:0%
they can scuttle a a timber sale
um

00:53:43.270 --> 00:53:43.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:53:45.109 --> 00:53:45.119 align:start position:0%
and you know
 
00:53:47.750 --> 00:53:47.760 align:start position:0%
the we already have a permitting process
 
00:53:50.470 --> 00:53:50.480 align:start position:0%
in place most of the forestry permits go
 
00:53:52.870 --> 00:53:52.880 align:start position:0%
through a notification process
 
00:53:56.470 --> 00:53:56.480 align:start position:0%
if there's a prime wetland associated
 
00:53:59.910 --> 00:53:59.920 align:start position:0%
with a particular timber sale
 
00:54:03.030 --> 00:54:03.040 align:start position:0%
that kicks that permit up to a standard
 
00:54:06.230 --> 00:54:06.240 align:start position:0%
dredge and fill permit
 
00:54:06.240 --> 00:54:07.109 align:start position:0%
dredge and fill permit
and

00:54:07.109 --> 00:54:07.119 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:54:08.950 --> 00:54:08.960 align:start position:0%
you know right now
 
00:54:11.190 --> 00:54:11.200 align:start position:0%
that takes it to another level that just
 
00:54:14.069 --> 00:54:14.079 align:start position:0%
is not economically tenable for a for a
 
00:54:16.790 --> 00:54:16.800 align:start position:0%
forestry project
 
00:54:19.750 --> 00:54:19.760 align:start position:0%
and again even if there is a waiver
 
00:54:21.109 --> 00:54:21.119 align:start position:0%
being sought
 
00:54:23.270 --> 00:54:23.280 align:start position:0%
there is still opportunity for
 
00:54:25.430 --> 00:54:25.440 align:start position:0%
conservation commissions
 
00:54:28.870 --> 00:54:28.880 align:start position:0%
and others to comment and modify your
 
00:54:31.589 --> 00:54:31.599 align:start position:0%
your permit or your your forester's
 
00:54:34.549 --> 00:54:34.559 align:start position:0%
project even the the harvesting itself
 
00:54:36.549 --> 00:54:36.559 align:start position:0%
critique that
 
00:54:38.470 --> 00:54:38.480 align:start position:0%
there's also a requirement for a butter
 
00:54:38.480 --> 00:54:40.069 align:start position:0%
there's also a requirement for a butter
notification

00:54:40.069 --> 00:54:40.079 align:start position:0%
notification
 
00:54:43.430 --> 00:54:43.440 align:start position:0%
and notifying the butters again this and
 
00:54:45.510 --> 00:54:45.520 align:start position:0%
if you think of a finger or toe as we've
 
00:54:47.190 --> 00:54:47.200 align:start position:0%
talked about i mean some of these prime
 
00:54:47.200 --> 00:54:48.309 align:start position:0%
talked about i mean some of these prime
wetlands

00:54:48.309 --> 00:54:48.319 align:start position:0%
wetlands
 
00:54:50.950 --> 00:54:50.960 align:start position:0%
um include water bodies such as the bear
 
00:54:53.030 --> 00:54:53.040 align:start position:0%
camp river
 
00:54:55.430 --> 00:54:55.440 align:start position:0%
that you can start to see where you can
 
00:54:58.230 --> 00:54:58.240 align:start position:0%
get into a lot of a butter notification
 
00:55:01.190 --> 00:55:01.200 align:start position:0%
in and adjacent to these bodies of water
 
00:55:04.390 --> 00:55:04.400 align:start position:0%
and sending sending a certified letters
 
00:55:05.990 --> 00:55:06.000 align:start position:0%
and ensuring that those abutters get
 
00:55:08.790 --> 00:55:08.800 align:start position:0%
notified that is a significant not only
 
00:55:11.030 --> 00:55:11.040 align:start position:0%
cost but but time
 
00:55:11.040 --> 00:55:12.309 align:start position:0%
cost but but time
um

00:55:12.309 --> 00:55:12.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:55:16.390 --> 00:55:16.400 align:start position:0%
so again you know 158 i i appreciate the
 
00:55:19.829 --> 00:55:19.839 align:start position:0%
sponsors attempt to try to put some
 
00:55:19.839 --> 00:55:20.549 align:start position:0%
sponsors attempt to try to put some
but

00:55:20.549 --> 00:55:20.559 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:55:24.309 --> 00:55:24.319 align:start position:0%
really this this bill expands
 
00:55:27.750 --> 00:55:27.760 align:start position:0%
you know ex as you've heard expands the
 
00:55:29.910 --> 00:55:29.920 align:start position:0%
universe of wetlands that would be
 
00:55:31.829 --> 00:55:31.839 align:start position:0%
eligible to include these fingers and
 
00:55:31.839 --> 00:55:32.790 align:start position:0%
eligible to include these fingers and
toes

00:55:32.790 --> 00:55:32.800 align:start position:0%
toes
 
00:55:36.069 --> 00:55:36.079 align:start position:0%
and by doing that um you know will it
 
00:55:38.309 --> 00:55:38.319 align:start position:0%
will negatively impact forestry and
 
00:55:40.069 --> 00:55:40.079 align:start position:0%
forest management
 
00:55:40.079 --> 00:55:40.950 align:start position:0%
forest management
um

00:55:40.950 --> 00:55:40.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:55:43.190 --> 00:55:43.200 align:start position:0%
the the last two things i wanted to
 
00:55:44.549 --> 00:55:44.559 align:start position:0%
touch on is
 
00:55:48.150 --> 00:55:48.160 align:start position:0%
you know again the the consideration
 
00:55:51.349 --> 00:55:51.359 align:start position:0%
the effects on landowners
 
00:55:53.589 --> 00:55:53.599 align:start position:0%
i appreciate that i'm not quite sure
 
00:55:55.829 --> 00:55:55.839 align:start position:0%
what consideration means
 
00:55:58.069 --> 00:55:58.079 align:start position:0%
um you know mr abbott had mentioned
 
00:56:00.470 --> 00:56:00.480 align:start position:0%
requiring landowner approval and we
 
00:56:03.030 --> 00:56:03.040 align:start position:0%
would say that was that is much more
 
00:56:04.549 --> 00:56:04.559 align:start position:0%
that is much more
 
00:56:06.870 --> 00:56:06.880 align:start position:0%
would be much more appropriate
 
00:56:06.880 --> 00:56:07.670 align:start position:0%
would be much more appropriate
so

00:56:07.670 --> 00:56:07.680 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:56:09.990 --> 00:56:10.000 align:start position:0%
um again for the sake of brevity and to
 
00:56:12.390 --> 00:56:12.400 align:start position:0%
keep within my my allocated timeline
 
00:56:15.109 --> 00:56:15.119 align:start position:0%
slot i would just like to say that you
 
00:56:17.430 --> 00:56:17.440 align:start position:0%
know this is for a landowner who has
 
00:56:17.440 --> 00:56:19.349 align:start position:0%
know this is for a landowner who has
these

00:56:19.349 --> 00:56:19.359 align:start position:0%
these
 
00:56:21.829 --> 00:56:21.839 align:start position:0%
wetlands on their property this is for
 
00:56:24.549 --> 00:56:24.559 align:start position:0%
them it is not voluntary compliance is
 
00:56:27.270 --> 00:56:27.280 align:start position:0%
not voluntary and the cost and
 
00:56:28.950 --> 00:56:28.960 align:start position:0%
administrative burden that comes with
 
00:56:31.109 --> 00:56:31.119 align:start position:0%
compliance for something as simple as
 
00:56:33.670 --> 00:56:33.680 align:start position:0%
doing a forest forestry project
 
00:56:35.990 --> 00:56:36.000 align:start position:0%
is significant enough that it is it is
 
00:56:39.109 --> 00:56:39.119 align:start position:0%
it is a problem in those 33 communities
 
00:56:41.109 --> 00:56:41.119 align:start position:0%
so with that i'll i'll conclude my
 
00:56:42.950 --> 00:56:42.960 align:start position:0%
testimony i'd be happy to answer any
 
00:56:42.960 --> 00:56:45.109 align:start position:0%
testimony i'd be happy to answer any
questions

00:56:45.109 --> 00:56:45.119 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:56:47.190 --> 00:56:47.200 align:start position:0%
any questions i'm sure we have one
 
00:56:50.470 --> 00:56:50.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:51.990 --> 00:56:52.000 align:start position:0%
representative kelly
 
00:56:54.470 --> 00:56:54.480 align:start position:0%
uh representative kelly uh
 
00:56:56.950 --> 00:56:56.960 align:start position:0%
our question
 
00:56:58.789 --> 00:56:58.799 align:start position:0%
yes thank you mr chairman uh thank you
 
00:57:00.390 --> 00:57:00.400 align:start position:0%
for being here mr stock um just a
 
00:57:02.230 --> 00:57:02.240 align:start position:0%
question did you um do you have any
 
00:57:04.950 --> 00:57:04.960 align:start position:0%
sense of uh what percentage
 
00:57:07.510 --> 00:57:07.520 align:start position:0%
of the toa members live in the 33
 
00:57:08.789 --> 00:57:08.799 align:start position:0%
communities with prime wetland
 
00:57:08.799 --> 00:57:10.309 align:start position:0%
communities with prime wetland
designations

00:57:10.309 --> 00:57:10.319 align:start position:0%
designations
 
00:57:13.430 --> 00:57:13.440 align:start position:0%
we we have we have thank you for the
 
00:57:15.589 --> 00:57:15.599 align:start position:0%
question we have members across the
 
00:57:15.599 --> 00:57:16.710 align:start position:0%
question we have members across the
state

00:57:16.710 --> 00:57:16.720 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:57:19.349 --> 00:57:19.359 align:start position:0%
um and so i have not done i have not
 
00:57:19.359 --> 00:57:20.789 align:start position:0%
um and so i have not done i have not
done

00:57:20.789 --> 00:57:20.799 align:start position:0%
done
 
00:57:23.589 --> 00:57:23.599 align:start position:0%
dove into our our membership roles
 
00:57:26.470 --> 00:57:26.480 align:start position:0%
um to see what towns we have members in
 
00:57:28.470 --> 00:57:28.480 align:start position:0%
what i can tell you is when i look at
 
00:57:31.109 --> 00:57:31.119 align:start position:0%
timber tax data and where from the
 
00:57:33.510 --> 00:57:33.520 align:start position:0%
department of revenue administration
 
00:57:35.910 --> 00:57:35.920 align:start position:0%
almost every town in the state on an
 
00:57:38.870 --> 00:57:38.880 align:start position:0%
annual basis sees a timber harvest
 
00:57:41.670 --> 00:57:41.680 align:start position:0%
so having said that each one of those
 
00:57:41.680 --> 00:57:42.789 align:start position:0%
so having said that each one of those
towns

00:57:42.789 --> 00:57:42.799 align:start position:0%
towns
 
00:57:44.470 --> 00:57:44.480 align:start position:0%
i am i can speak with a degree of
 
00:57:46.870 --> 00:57:46.880 align:start position:0%
certainty each one of those towns with a
 
00:57:49.510 --> 00:57:49.520 align:start position:0%
with designated prime wetlands will have
 
00:57:52.470 --> 00:57:52.480 align:start position:0%
some forestry timber management it may
 
00:57:55.510 --> 00:57:55.520 align:start position:0%
not be a toa landowner member it may be
 
00:57:58.150 --> 00:57:58.160 align:start position:0%
a nhgoa logger
 
00:58:01.589 --> 00:58:01.599 align:start position:0%
forester or an nhtoa sawmill that's
 
00:58:04.230 --> 00:58:04.240 align:start position:0%
trying to purchase logs
 
00:58:06.710 --> 00:58:06.720 align:start position:0%
from that particular parcel that that
 
00:58:08.390 --> 00:58:08.400 align:start position:0%
would be affected so
 
00:58:10.309 --> 00:58:10.319 align:start position:0%
as an association we represent the
 
00:58:11.910 --> 00:58:11.920 align:start position:0%
entire food chain
 
00:58:11.920 --> 00:58:12.870 align:start position:0%
entire food chain
so

00:58:12.870 --> 00:58:12.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:58:15.990 --> 00:58:16.000 align:start position:0%
we this affects us on many parts of our
 
00:58:17.910 --> 00:58:17.920 align:start position:0%
supply chain in many parts of the
 
00:58:17.920 --> 00:58:21.670 align:start position:0%
supply chain in many parts of the
industry

00:58:21.670 --> 00:58:21.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:23.109 --> 00:58:23.119 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
00:58:24.150 --> 00:58:24.160 align:start position:0%
you're welcome
 
00:58:25.750 --> 00:58:25.760 align:start position:0%
any other questions by members of the
 
00:58:25.760 --> 00:58:26.710 align:start position:0%
any other questions by members of the
committee

00:58:26.710 --> 00:58:26.720 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:58:28.630 --> 00:58:28.640 align:start position:0%
sir representative spang
 
00:58:31.430 --> 00:58:31.440 align:start position:0%
uh representative spang uh you have a
 
00:58:31.440 --> 00:58:32.630 align:start position:0%
uh representative spang uh you have a
question

00:58:32.630 --> 00:58:32.640 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:58:34.390 --> 00:58:34.400 align:start position:0%
yes i do
 
00:58:36.950 --> 00:58:36.960 align:start position:0%
can you hear me yeah
 
00:58:36.960 --> 00:58:38.549 align:start position:0%
can you hear me yeah
um

00:58:38.549 --> 00:58:38.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:58:41.910 --> 00:58:41.920 align:start position:0%
mr stock can you tell me uh what are
 
00:58:43.750 --> 00:58:43.760 align:start position:0%
currently the
 
00:58:43.760 --> 00:58:44.630 align:start position:0%
currently the
uh

00:58:44.630 --> 00:58:44.640 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:58:44.640 --> 00:58:45.750 align:start position:0%
uh
the

00:58:45.750 --> 00:58:45.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:58:48.829 --> 00:58:48.839 align:start position:0%
the areas where the uh or the
 
00:58:52.309 --> 00:58:52.319 align:start position:0%
exemptions that foresters have
 
00:58:52.319 --> 00:58:53.990 align:start position:0%
exemptions that foresters have
from

00:58:53.990 --> 00:58:54.000 align:start position:0%
from
 
00:58:57.030 --> 00:58:57.040 align:start position:0%
wetland regulations
 
00:58:59.430 --> 00:58:59.440 align:start position:0%
it seemed i i was under the impression
 
00:59:01.829 --> 00:59:01.839 align:start position:0%
that they are exempt from almost all
 
00:59:05.670 --> 00:59:05.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:07.670 --> 00:59:07.680 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question we are not
 
00:59:07.680 --> 00:59:09.829 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question we are not
exempt

00:59:09.829 --> 00:59:09.839 align:start position:0%
exempt
 
00:59:09.839 --> 00:59:10.950 align:start position:0%
exempt
um

00:59:10.950 --> 00:59:10.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:59:12.710 --> 00:59:12.720 align:start position:0%
and and if you'd like to introduce a
 
00:59:14.549 --> 00:59:14.559 align:start position:0%
bill to do that
 
00:59:17.190 --> 00:59:17.200 align:start position:0%
i'd be happy to talk with you about that
 
00:59:19.190 --> 00:59:19.200 align:start position:0%
we are not exempt from from dredge and
 
00:59:21.030 --> 00:59:21.040 align:start position:0%
phil permits in fact
 
00:59:21.040 --> 00:59:22.150 align:start position:0%
phil permits in fact
anytime

00:59:22.150 --> 00:59:22.160 align:start position:0%
anytime
 
00:59:25.109 --> 00:59:25.119 align:start position:0%
anytime a a forestry operation occurs on
 
00:59:26.390 --> 00:59:26.400 align:start position:0%
a piece of property and there are
 
00:59:28.150 --> 00:59:28.160 align:start position:0%
wetlands present
 
00:59:31.109 --> 00:59:31.119 align:start position:0%
you we have to obtain a
 
00:59:32.549 --> 00:59:32.559 align:start position:0%
and there's going to be an impact i
 
00:59:34.150 --> 00:59:34.160 align:start position:0%
should say so if you're cutting a 50
 
00:59:36.390 --> 00:59:36.400 align:start position:0%
acre lot there's wetlands on the back
 
00:59:39.030 --> 00:59:39.040 align:start position:0%
three acres and you're not going near it
 
00:59:41.430 --> 00:59:41.440 align:start position:0%
obviously you would not file
 
00:59:43.750 --> 00:59:43.760 align:start position:0%
not file any permits for that
 
00:59:47.349 --> 00:59:47.359 align:start position:0%
but if you're going to cross a stream
 
00:59:50.470 --> 00:59:50.480 align:start position:0%
or if you're going to um
 
00:59:53.670 --> 00:59:53.680 align:start position:0%
primarily stream stream crossings or if
 
00:59:55.030 --> 00:59:55.040 align:start position:0%
there's areas where there are
 
00:59:58.069 --> 00:59:58.079 align:start position:0%
depressions a a defined channel we have
 
01:00:00.069 --> 01:00:00.079 align:start position:0%
to obtain a permit from the department
 
01:00:02.309 --> 01:00:02.319 align:start position:0%
of environmental services
 
01:00:05.510 --> 01:00:05.520 align:start position:0%
and in those instances we have it's a
 
01:00:08.630 --> 01:00:08.640 align:start position:0%
spn a statutory permit by notification
 
01:00:10.390 --> 01:00:10.400 align:start position:0%
we have to obtain
 
01:00:12.870 --> 01:00:12.880 align:start position:0%
it's a form we complete we do a natural
 
01:00:15.670 --> 01:00:15.680 align:start position:0%
heritage check on the property
 
01:00:17.030 --> 01:00:17.040 align:start position:0%
we have to
 
01:00:20.069 --> 01:00:20.079 align:start position:0%
abide by best management practices
 
01:00:20.079 --> 01:00:20.950 align:start position:0%
abide by best management practices
and

01:00:20.950 --> 01:00:20.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:00:24.309 --> 01:00:24.319 align:start position:0%
have to basically the landowner and the
 
01:00:28.069 --> 01:00:28.079 align:start position:0%
the logger or forester sign sign that
 
01:00:30.470 --> 01:00:30.480 align:start position:0%
verifying that best management practices
 
01:00:32.710 --> 01:00:32.720 align:start position:0%
are being followed a natural heritage
 
01:00:35.670 --> 01:00:35.680 align:start position:0%
check was obtained and conducted on the
 
01:00:35.680 --> 01:00:36.870 align:start position:0%
check was obtained and conducted on the
property

01:00:36.870 --> 01:00:36.880 align:start position:0%
property
 
01:00:38.470 --> 01:00:38.480 align:start position:0%
the instances
 
01:00:40.470 --> 01:00:40.480 align:start position:0%
where you where
 
01:00:44.470 --> 01:00:44.480 align:start position:0%
a permit is not required and this is a
 
01:00:47.510 --> 01:00:47.520 align:start position:0%
a piece of paper but we have to is if we
 
01:00:50.150 --> 01:00:50.160 align:start position:0%
are operating on frozen ground today is
 
01:00:51.670 --> 01:00:51.680 align:start position:0%
a great example
 
01:00:54.630 --> 01:00:54.640 align:start position:0%
frozen ground where there is no
 
01:00:57.910 --> 01:00:57.920 align:start position:0%
no rutting or any type of impact at all
 
01:00:59.750 --> 01:00:59.760 align:start position:0%
if you're in a forested wetland and
 
01:01:02.470 --> 01:01:02.480 align:start position:0%
there's no impact because it's frozen
 
01:01:04.789 --> 01:01:04.799 align:start position:0%
or it's dry enough
 
01:01:07.430 --> 01:01:07.440 align:start position:0%
at that point we have it's basically a
 
01:01:09.030 --> 01:01:09.040 align:start position:0%
permit by rule
 
01:01:12.789 --> 01:01:12.799 align:start position:0%
and we can operate in those instances
 
01:01:16.069 --> 01:01:16.079 align:start position:0%
and not have to obtain a permit
 
01:01:17.829 --> 01:01:17.839 align:start position:0%
other strategies and management
 
01:01:19.829 --> 01:01:19.839 align:start position:0%
practices that get used as use of
 
01:01:22.950 --> 01:01:22.960 align:start position:0%
corduroy or brush in
 
01:01:25.510 --> 01:01:25.520 align:start position:0%
in travel ways or skid trails
 
01:01:27.990 --> 01:01:28.000 align:start position:0%
to create a
 
01:01:31.030 --> 01:01:31.040 align:start position:0%
i guess a kind of a a mattress or pillow
 
01:01:33.190 --> 01:01:33.200 align:start position:0%
in which you operate on in those
 
01:01:33.200 --> 01:01:34.309 align:start position:0%
in which you operate on in those
instances

01:01:34.309 --> 01:01:34.319 align:start position:0%
instances
 
01:01:36.470 --> 01:01:36.480 align:start position:0%
you can operate if you're not creating
 
01:01:39.190 --> 01:01:39.200 align:start position:0%
ruts if you're not creating
 
01:01:41.990 --> 01:01:42.000 align:start position:0%
any type of alteration of that
 
01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:43.589 align:start position:0%
any type of alteration of that
topography

01:01:43.589 --> 01:01:43.599 align:start position:0%
topography
 
01:01:46.390 --> 01:01:46.400 align:start position:0%
you basically have a permit by permit by
 
01:01:49.030 --> 01:01:49.040 align:start position:0%
rule but we do the wetland rules do
 
01:01:50.549 --> 01:01:50.559 align:start position:0%
apply to us
 
01:01:54.390 --> 01:01:54.400 align:start position:0%
we do um and des and the forest rangers
 
01:01:56.870 --> 01:01:56.880 align:start position:0%
to the division of forests and lands
 
01:01:59.510 --> 01:01:59.520 align:start position:0%
do inspect jobs they inspect jobs
 
01:02:02.309 --> 01:02:02.319 align:start position:0%
against the the stand the wetlands law
 
01:02:03.990 --> 01:02:04.000 align:start position:0%
and the wetlands rules
 
01:02:06.710 --> 01:02:06.720 align:start position:0%
and if someone is violating that there
 
01:02:09.109 --> 01:02:09.119 align:start position:0%
are tickets issued so
 
01:02:11.829 --> 01:02:11.839 align:start position:0%
the rules do apply and we do obtain
 
01:02:11.839 --> 01:02:17.190 align:start position:0%
the rules do apply and we do obtain
permits

01:02:17.190 --> 01:02:17.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:19.270 --> 01:02:19.280 align:start position:0%
for a follow-up one
 
01:02:22.230 --> 01:02:22.240 align:start position:0%
but isn't the permit by notification a
 
01:02:25.430 --> 01:02:25.440 align:start position:0%
significantly easier thing to do than
 
01:02:27.670 --> 01:02:27.680 align:start position:0%
say what a developer would have to do to
 
01:02:30.950 --> 01:02:30.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:34.390 --> 01:02:34.400 align:start position:0%
absolutely and and i think that's wisely
 
01:02:36.069 --> 01:02:36.079 align:start position:0%
i think that there's a reason behind
 
01:02:37.589 --> 01:02:37.599 align:start position:0%
that um
 
01:02:40.630 --> 01:02:40.640 align:start position:0%
forestry is a transient activity you're
 
01:02:42.470 --> 01:02:42.480 align:start position:0%
not going to have a long-term permanent
 
01:02:42.480 --> 01:02:43.829 align:start position:0%
not going to have a long-term permanent
impact

01:02:43.829 --> 01:02:43.839 align:start position:0%
impact
 
01:02:46.309 --> 01:02:46.319 align:start position:0%
um like you would with an ass you know
 
01:02:48.390 --> 01:02:48.400 align:start position:0%
impervious surfaces
 
01:02:48.400 --> 01:02:49.510 align:start position:0%
impervious surfaces
um

01:02:49.510 --> 01:02:49.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:02:50.870 --> 01:02:50.880 align:start position:0%
you know and
 
01:02:52.710 --> 01:02:52.720 align:start position:0%
quite frankly i think the state of new
 
01:02:54.549 --> 01:02:54.559 align:start position:0%
hampshire through its policies has
 
01:02:57.190 --> 01:02:57.200 align:start position:0%
recognized over the years that forestry
 
01:03:00.230 --> 01:03:00.240 align:start position:0%
and forest management are desirable land
 
01:03:03.190 --> 01:03:03.200 align:start position:0%
uses and that we do not want to
 
01:03:05.109 --> 01:03:05.119 align:start position:0%
want to hinder those we want to in fact
 
01:03:06.870 --> 01:03:06.880 align:start position:0%
encourage good forestry and good
 
01:03:08.630 --> 01:03:08.640 align:start position:0%
management for all the reasons you've
 
01:03:09.990 --> 01:03:10.000 align:start position:0%
heard earlier
 
01:03:12.309 --> 01:03:12.319 align:start position:0%
so the permit application
 
01:03:15.589 --> 01:03:15.599 align:start position:0%
is a notification process
 
01:03:17.349 --> 01:03:17.359 align:start position:0%
part of that reason that it is a
 
01:03:20.470 --> 01:03:20.480 align:start position:0%
notification is so that it can move
 
01:03:22.230 --> 01:03:22.240 align:start position:0%
you can move quickly
 
01:03:22.240 --> 01:03:23.670 align:start position:0%
you can move quickly
and

01:03:23.670 --> 01:03:23.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:03:25.109 --> 01:03:25.119 align:start position:0%
there's an assurance that there are
 
01:03:28.309 --> 01:03:28.319 align:start position:0%
rules and going to be followed but again
 
01:03:30.549 --> 01:03:30.559 align:start position:0%
in in forestry because we are a weather
 
01:03:33.990 --> 01:03:34.000 align:start position:0%
dependent dependent uh industry there
 
01:03:36.230 --> 01:03:36.240 align:start position:0%
are instances where i may be operating
 
01:03:38.630 --> 01:03:38.640 align:start position:0%
on the spang tree farm
 
01:03:40.870 --> 01:03:40.880 align:start position:0%
and all of a sudden
 
01:03:40.880 --> 01:03:41.910 align:start position:0%
and all of a sudden
um

01:03:41.910 --> 01:03:41.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:03:43.990 --> 01:03:44.000 align:start position:0%
the ground you know it's we get a nice
 
01:03:46.710 --> 01:03:46.720 align:start position:0%
january february thought and i say all
 
01:03:46.720 --> 01:03:47.589 align:start position:0%
january february thought and i say all
right

01:03:47.589 --> 01:03:47.599 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:03:49.750 --> 01:03:49.760 align:start position:0%
representative spang we can't we can't
 
01:03:51.829 --> 01:03:51.839 align:start position:0%
operate here the ground is starting to
 
01:03:53.670 --> 01:03:53.680 align:start position:0%
thaw we're going to have to move our
 
01:03:56.150 --> 01:03:56.160 align:start position:0%
operation we're going to go
 
01:03:57.829 --> 01:03:57.839 align:start position:0%
we're going to go up to uh we have
 
01:04:01.109 --> 01:04:01.119 align:start position:0%
another lot up in madbury let's do that
 
01:04:03.430 --> 01:04:03.440 align:start position:0%
all right to get that permit in place to
 
01:04:05.109 --> 01:04:05.119 align:start position:0%
go through a
 
01:04:07.510 --> 01:04:07.520 align:start position:0%
you know a multi-month
 
01:04:10.950 --> 01:04:10.960 align:start position:0%
multi-week process to obtain a permit
 
01:04:14.390 --> 01:04:14.400 align:start position:0%
i do i lose that flexibility to move
 
01:04:16.309 --> 01:04:16.319 align:start position:0%
we had heard with the prime wetlands you
 
01:04:18.789 --> 01:04:18.799 align:start position:0%
have 14 days then there's an additional
 
01:04:22.950 --> 01:04:22.960 align:start position:0%
20 days and a a public hearing can be
 
01:04:25.829 --> 01:04:25.839 align:start position:0%
sought as well so you start adding that
 
01:04:25.839 --> 01:04:26.549 align:start position:0%
sought as well so you start adding that
up

01:04:26.549 --> 01:04:26.559 align:start position:0%
up
 
01:04:29.029 --> 01:04:29.039 align:start position:0%
you start looking at a month
 
01:04:31.029 --> 01:04:31.039 align:start position:0%
almost a month's time
 
01:04:33.109 --> 01:04:33.119 align:start position:0%
to obtain a permit
 
01:04:34.390 --> 01:04:34.400 align:start position:0%
to say
 
01:04:36.309 --> 01:04:36.319 align:start position:0%
in this instance if i have to move my
 
01:04:39.750 --> 01:04:39.760 align:start position:0%
operation to to drier ground and i have
 
01:04:39.760 --> 01:04:40.390 align:start position:0%
operation to to drier ground and i have
to

01:04:40.390 --> 01:04:40.400 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:04:42.630 --> 01:04:42.640 align:start position:0%
do a brook crossing well
 
01:04:44.710 --> 01:04:44.720 align:start position:0%
if that brook happens to be
 
01:04:46.549 --> 01:04:46.559 align:start position:0%
a prime wetland
 
01:04:48.789 --> 01:04:48.799 align:start position:0%
that can that can that will affect my
 
01:04:51.029 --> 01:04:51.039 align:start position:0%
operation and my ability to keep my crew
 
01:04:51.039 --> 01:04:51.990 align:start position:0%
operation and my ability to keep my crew
busy

01:04:51.990 --> 01:04:52.000 align:start position:0%
busy
 
01:04:55.270 --> 01:04:55.280 align:start position:0%
and keep my my operation only
 
01:04:57.670 --> 01:04:57.680 align:start position:0%
i wondered where you had gone with your
 
01:05:04.230 --> 01:05:04.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:05.829 --> 01:05:05.839 align:start position:0%
thank you for your contribution to the
 
01:05:09.910 --> 01:05:09.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:12.230 --> 01:05:12.240 align:start position:0%
representative through the questions
 
01:05:13.910 --> 01:05:13.920 align:start position:0%
come through the chair
 
01:05:15.990 --> 01:05:16.000 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your testimony
 
01:05:18.309 --> 01:05:18.319 align:start position:0%
you're welcome
 
01:05:23.190 --> 01:05:23.200 align:start position:0%
no further questions here okay mr chair
 
01:05:26.470 --> 01:05:26.480 align:start position:0%
i'd like to go on thank you
 
01:05:30.710 --> 01:05:30.720 align:start position:0%
this uh is let's see i'm going to call
 
01:05:32.230 --> 01:05:32.240 align:start position:0%
i think uh
 
01:05:34.069 --> 01:05:34.079 align:start position:0%
i see i i
 
01:05:36.870 --> 01:05:36.880 align:start position:0%
see there rick der pall

who you represent and uh
 
01:06:02.150 --> 01:06:02.160 align:start position:0%
how uh how long you are you're planning
 
01:06:04.150 --> 01:06:04.160 align:start position:0%
to speak
 
01:06:06.069 --> 01:06:06.079 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair my name is rick
 
01:06:08.390 --> 01:06:08.400 align:start position:0%
vandepole i'm a certified wetland
 
01:06:10.549 --> 01:06:10.559 align:start position:0%
scientist i live in sandwich new
 
01:06:13.510 --> 01:06:13.520 align:start position:0%
hampshire and i am alone
 
01:06:16.870 --> 01:06:16.880 align:start position:0%
i will summarize my comments to for the
 
01:06:18.870 --> 01:06:18.880 align:start position:0%
sake of brevity
 
01:06:21.349 --> 01:06:21.359 align:start position:0%
but as many of you know
 
01:06:24.069 --> 01:06:24.079 align:start position:0%
i have been behind this prime wetlands
 
01:06:24.079 --> 01:06:25.430 align:start position:0%
i have been behind this prime wetlands
initiative

01:06:25.430 --> 01:06:25.440 align:start position:0%
initiative
 
01:06:29.349 --> 01:06:29.359 align:start position:0%
um actually ever since it started
 
01:06:32.150 --> 01:06:32.160 align:start position:0%
i was not there unfortunately in 1979
 
01:06:32.160 --> 01:06:32.950 align:start position:0%
i was not there unfortunately in 1979
but

01:06:32.950 --> 01:06:32.960 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:06:35.349 --> 01:06:35.359 align:start position:0%
has have been a wetland scientist since
 
01:06:35.359 --> 01:06:37.029 align:start position:0%
has have been a wetland scientist since
1988

01:06:37.029 --> 01:06:37.039 align:start position:0%
1988
 
01:06:38.549 --> 01:06:38.559 align:start position:0%
i helped found the new hampshire
 
01:06:40.309 --> 01:06:40.319 align:start position:0%
association of natural resource
 
01:06:42.549 --> 01:06:42.559 align:start position:0%
scientists i served in the new hampshire
 
01:06:46.230 --> 01:06:46.240 align:start position:0%
joint board for 10 years as chair chair
 
01:06:49.029 --> 01:06:49.039 align:start position:0%
and i regularly permit
 
01:06:51.589 --> 01:06:51.599 align:start position:0%
wetlands that involve prime wetlands as
 
01:06:51.599 --> 01:06:52.789 align:start position:0%
wetlands that involve prime wetlands as
well

01:06:52.789 --> 01:06:52.799 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:06:55.270 --> 01:06:55.280 align:start position:0%
across the state of new hampshire
 
01:06:57.910 --> 01:06:57.920 align:start position:0%
i have six points that again i will
 
01:06:57.920 --> 01:06:59.430 align:start position:0%
i have six points that again i will
summarize

01:06:59.430 --> 01:06:59.440 align:start position:0%
summarize
 
01:07:01.349 --> 01:07:01.359 align:start position:0%
point one being that we've already
 
01:07:02.950 --> 01:07:02.960 align:start position:0%
passed this bill
 
01:07:04.870 --> 01:07:04.880 align:start position:0%
and in fact we went through a rather
 
01:07:07.270 --> 01:07:07.280 align:start position:0%
rigorous process as representative
 
01:07:08.950 --> 01:07:08.960 align:start position:0%
grassy indicated
 
01:07:10.950 --> 01:07:10.960 align:start position:0%
to make sure that we had found a
 
01:07:13.029 --> 01:07:13.039 align:start position:0%
compromised solution
 
01:07:17.270 --> 01:07:17.280 align:start position:0%
because as it stands now in 2012
 
01:07:19.430 --> 01:07:19.440 align:start position:0%
the prime wetlands
 
01:07:22.150 --> 01:07:22.160 align:start position:0%
component of rsa42a
 
01:07:25.109 --> 01:07:25.119 align:start position:0%
has been shut down and it will still
 
01:07:27.670 --> 01:07:27.680 align:start position:0%
be shut down if we don't pass a bill
 
01:07:29.109 --> 01:07:29.119 align:start position:0%
similar to this
 
01:07:31.109 --> 01:07:31.119 align:start position:0%
for the very simple reason that it's not
 
01:07:32.549 --> 01:07:32.559 align:start position:0%
just the ditches
 
01:07:35.029 --> 01:07:35.039 align:start position:0%
it is every single point
 
01:07:38.069 --> 01:07:38.079 align:start position:0%
that is less than 50 feet wide has to be
 
01:07:39.510 --> 01:07:39.520 align:start position:0%
clipped off
 
01:07:42.390 --> 01:07:42.400 align:start position:0%
of a wetland that is being designated as
 
01:07:42.400 --> 01:07:43.349 align:start position:0%
of a wetland that is being designated as
prime

01:07:43.349 --> 01:07:43.359 align:start position:0%
prime
 
01:07:45.430 --> 01:07:45.440 align:start position:0%
and if you think about this one of the
 
01:07:45.440 --> 01:07:46.710 align:start position:0%
and if you think about this one of the
biggest

01:07:46.710 --> 01:07:46.720 align:start position:0%
biggest
 
01:07:48.390 --> 01:07:48.400 align:start position:0%
concerns that the new hampshire
 
01:07:49.910 --> 01:07:49.920 align:start position:0%
association of natural resource
 
01:07:52.470 --> 01:07:52.480 align:start position:0%
scientists had back when we talked about
 
01:07:55.109 --> 01:07:55.119 align:start position:0%
only having very poorly drained soils as
 
01:07:58.069 --> 01:07:58.079 align:start position:0%
prime wetlands is that nobody is going
 
01:08:00.630 --> 01:08:00.640 align:start position:0%
to be able to go out into a marsh or the
 
01:08:03.589 --> 01:08:03.599 align:start position:0%
edge of a marsh and delineate the edge
 
01:08:06.470 --> 01:08:06.480 align:start position:0%
of a very poorly drained soil
 
01:08:08.950 --> 01:08:08.960 align:start position:0%
so it goes with the 50 foot
 
01:08:11.109 --> 01:08:11.119 align:start position:0%
where does 50 foot where does 50 feet
 
01:08:12.549 --> 01:08:12.559 align:start position:0%
get cut off
 
01:08:14.710 --> 01:08:14.720 align:start position:0%
now the new hampshire shoreline water
 
01:08:17.269 --> 01:08:17.279 align:start position:0%
quality protection act has some guidance
 
01:08:19.749 --> 01:08:19.759 align:start position:0%
relative to a shoreline you go through
 
01:08:21.669 --> 01:08:21.679 align:start position:0%
the sort of narrowest point on it on a
 
01:08:23.349 --> 01:08:23.359 align:start position:0%
50 foot length
 
01:08:25.349 --> 01:08:25.359 align:start position:0%
if i were to do that as a wetland
 
01:08:28.149 --> 01:08:28.159 align:start position:0%
scientist it would triple the cost to
 
01:08:31.430 --> 01:08:31.440 align:start position:0%
the town for me to delineate a wetland
 
01:08:33.990 --> 01:08:34.000 align:start position:0%
so that's in other words it's not going
 
01:08:36.630 --> 01:08:36.640 align:start position:0%
to happen without a bill like this now i
 
01:08:38.390 --> 01:08:38.400 align:start position:0%
know that there are several people that
 
01:08:40.149 --> 01:08:40.159 align:start position:0%
probably would prefer that this bill
 
01:08:41.990 --> 01:08:42.000 align:start position:0%
doesn't come into place
 
01:08:43.590 --> 01:08:43.600 align:start position:0%
but i would incur
 
01:08:45.590 --> 01:08:45.600 align:start position:0%
representative spang's comments that
 
01:08:47.510 --> 01:08:47.520 align:start position:0%
this is a
 
01:08:50.309 --> 01:08:50.319 align:start position:0%
local option that's what it's called a15
 
01:08:54.149 --> 01:08:54.159 align:start position:0%
is a local option it's up to the town
 
01:08:56.630 --> 01:08:56.640 align:start position:0%
and it's a voluntary one as barbara
 
01:08:59.669 --> 01:08:59.679 align:start position:0%
richter spoke it is one that is not easy
 
01:09:01.510 --> 01:09:01.520 align:start position:0%
to get through it requires a
 
01:09:04.630 --> 01:09:04.640 align:start position:0%
considerable expense and yes we do
 
01:09:06.630 --> 01:09:06.640 align:start position:0%
communicate directly
 
01:09:09.269 --> 01:09:09.279 align:start position:0%
through mail to every a butter to a
 
01:09:12.950 --> 01:09:12.960 align:start position:0%
potential or candidate prime wetland
 
01:09:15.110 --> 01:09:15.120 align:start position:0%
i also would like to point out that no
 
01:09:17.829 --> 01:09:17.839 align:start position:0%
ditches are going to be approved by a
 
01:09:20.229 --> 01:09:20.239 align:start position:0%
town boat it's mo it is more than
 
01:09:22.789 --> 01:09:22.799 align:start position:0%
difficult to get everyone on board to
 
01:09:25.110 --> 01:09:25.120 align:start position:0%
even designate a prime wetland by a
 
01:09:27.430 --> 01:09:27.440 align:start position:0%
local option let alone get it approved
 
01:09:28.709 --> 01:09:28.719 align:start position:0%
by the state
 
01:09:31.030 --> 01:09:31.040 align:start position:0%
i as a certified wetland science will
 
01:09:33.590 --> 01:09:33.600 align:start position:0%
not include ditches i will not include
 
01:09:35.749 --> 01:09:35.759 align:start position:0%
narrow waterways that do not contain
 
01:09:38.470 --> 01:09:38.480 align:start position:0%
significant functions for this purpose
 
01:09:40.630 --> 01:09:40.640 align:start position:0%
that would be against the ethical
 
01:09:42.950 --> 01:09:42.960 align:start position:0%
underpinning of my certification as a
 
01:09:45.990 --> 01:09:46.000 align:start position:0%
wetland scientist i will only designate
 
01:09:49.110 --> 01:09:49.120 align:start position:0%
or propose to designate those wetlands
 
01:09:50.950 --> 01:09:50.960 align:start position:0%
that are the highest and the most
 
01:09:53.910 --> 01:09:53.920 align:start position:0%
valuable wetlands in the state
 
01:09:56.149 --> 01:09:56.159 align:start position:0%
and in that regard i'd like to point out
 
01:09:59.510 --> 01:09:59.520 align:start position:0%
two small pieces of statistics to
 
01:10:01.590 --> 01:10:01.600 align:start position:0%
contradict some of what you've heard as
 
01:10:04.470 --> 01:10:04.480 align:start position:0%
far as testimony goes today
 
01:10:06.950 --> 01:10:06.960 align:start position:0%
we have roughly in our new hampshire
 
01:10:06.960 --> 01:10:08.149 align:start position:0%
we have roughly in our new hampshire
wetlands

01:10:08.149 --> 01:10:08.159 align:start position:0%
wetlands
 
01:10:12.310 --> 01:10:12.320 align:start position:0%
update map roughly 4.8 percent of the
 
01:10:14.470 --> 01:10:14.480 align:start position:0%
state is wetland
 
01:10:17.990 --> 01:10:18.000 align:start position:0%
another 3 to 3.2 percent is open water
 
01:10:20.229 --> 01:10:20.239 align:start position:0%
body lakes and ponds
 
01:10:21.750 --> 01:10:21.760 align:start position:0%
in other words we have a small
 
01:10:23.510 --> 01:10:23.520 align:start position:0%
percentage of the landscape that is
 
01:10:25.990 --> 01:10:26.000 align:start position:0%
wetland and if you calculate the amount
 
01:10:28.229 --> 01:10:28.239 align:start position:0%
of prime wetlands there are in this
 
01:10:31.910 --> 01:10:31.920 align:start position:0%
state at present it comes to about point
 
01:10:35.270 --> 01:10:35.280 align:start position:0%
one seven percent of the entire wetland
 
01:10:35.280 --> 01:10:36.870 align:start position:0%
one seven percent of the entire wetland
resource

01:10:36.870 --> 01:10:36.880 align:start position:0%
resource
 
01:10:39.669 --> 01:10:39.679 align:start position:0%
point one seven percent
 
01:10:39.679 --> 01:10:40.790 align:start position:0%
point one seven percent
okay

01:10:40.790 --> 01:10:40.800 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:10:40.800 --> 01:10:41.669 align:start position:0%
okay
so

01:10:41.669 --> 01:10:41.679 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:10:43.750 --> 01:10:43.760 align:start position:0%
these claims that it's going to disrupt
 
01:10:46.390 --> 01:10:46.400 align:start position:0%
development and disrupt
 
01:10:48.310 --> 01:10:48.320 align:start position:0%
forest activity
 
01:10:50.149 --> 01:10:50.159 align:start position:0%
are false
 
01:10:52.550 --> 01:10:52.560 align:start position:0%
the total area of even if the hundred
 
01:10:55.430 --> 01:10:55.440 align:start position:0%
foot buffer was still present the total
 
01:10:58.310 --> 01:10:58.320 align:start position:0%
area of forest land around all all of
 
01:11:00.790 --> 01:11:00.800 align:start position:0%
the prime wetlands is four percent of
 
01:11:03.510 --> 01:11:03.520 align:start position:0%
the landscape in these towns
 
01:11:03.520 --> 01:11:04.310 align:start position:0%
the landscape in these towns
now

01:11:04.310 --> 01:11:04.320 align:start position:0%
now
 
01:11:06.470 --> 01:11:06.480 align:start position:0%
please keep in mind that
 
01:11:08.630 --> 01:11:08.640 align:start position:0%
as a wetland scientist we're looking for
 
01:11:11.750 --> 01:11:11.760 align:start position:0%
wildlife function functional value we
 
01:11:15.030 --> 01:11:15.040 align:start position:0%
have to in order to designate a prime
 
01:11:17.990 --> 01:11:18.000 align:start position:0%
last time i checked most of our species
 
01:11:20.550 --> 01:11:20.560 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire prefer a forested
 
01:11:23.430 --> 01:11:23.440 align:start position:0%
habitat not a clear-cut one but a
 
01:11:26.070 --> 01:11:26.080 align:start position:0%
forested habitat in order for that
 
01:11:27.910 --> 01:11:27.920 align:start position:0%
function to be intact
 
01:11:30.310 --> 01:11:30.320 align:start position:0%
and in fact in my recent mapping of
 
01:11:32.550 --> 01:11:32.560 align:start position:0%
fitzwilliam prime wetlands i found a
 
01:11:34.950 --> 01:11:34.960 align:start position:0%
number of areas that i excluded from
 
01:11:37.830 --> 01:11:37.840 align:start position:0%
designation because of damage done by
 
01:11:37.840 --> 01:11:39.590 align:start position:0%
designation because of damage done by
forestry

01:11:39.590 --> 01:11:39.600 align:start position:0%
forestry
 
01:11:42.310 --> 01:11:42.320 align:start position:0%
those areas had been compromised i did
 
01:11:44.950 --> 01:11:44.960 align:start position:0%
not designate them and i will continue
 
01:11:47.189 --> 01:11:47.199 align:start position:0%
to act that way and i think the state
 
01:11:49.590 --> 01:11:49.600 align:start position:0%
will recognize if in the absence of that
 
01:11:52.470 --> 01:11:52.480 align:start position:0%
functional value there is no basis or
 
01:11:55.830 --> 01:11:55.840 align:start position:0%
validity to designate a prime wetland so
 
01:11:58.790 --> 01:11:58.800 align:start position:0%
again to go to contradict some of those
 
01:12:00.630 --> 01:12:00.640 align:start position:0%
statements that have been made that
 
01:12:02.470 --> 01:12:02.480 align:start position:0%
would make you think perhaps that this
 
01:12:04.149 --> 01:12:04.159 align:start position:0%
is going to take away everybody's right
 
01:12:06.390 --> 01:12:06.400 align:start position:0%
to do what they want on their property
 
01:12:08.550 --> 01:12:08.560 align:start position:0%
that is not true i would counter by
 
01:12:10.550 --> 01:12:10.560 align:start position:0%
saying the flood water storage is going
 
01:12:12.550 --> 01:12:12.560 align:start position:0%
to save lives
 
01:12:15.270 --> 01:12:15.280 align:start position:0%
the drinking water recharge value of
 
01:12:17.830 --> 01:12:17.840 align:start position:0%
these fingers and toes is going to
 
01:12:20.870 --> 01:12:20.880 align:start position:0%
provide clean well water
 
01:12:22.709 --> 01:12:22.719 align:start position:0%
and try and replace wells when they get
 
01:12:25.030 --> 01:12:25.040 align:start position:0%
contaminated by road salt we made the
 
01:12:26.870 --> 01:12:26.880 align:start position:0%
exemption for dot
 
01:12:29.030 --> 01:12:29.040 align:start position:0%
we had to right i mean that was
 
01:12:29.040 --> 01:12:30.310 align:start position:0%
we had to right i mean that was
necessary

01:12:30.310 --> 01:12:30.320 align:start position:0%
necessary
 
01:12:33.110 --> 01:12:33.120 align:start position:0%
we made exemptions for the agc even
 
01:12:35.110 --> 01:12:35.120 align:start position:0%
though they now oppose it we actually
 
01:12:37.189 --> 01:12:37.199 align:start position:0%
reached a compromise with them
 
01:12:40.310 --> 01:12:40.320 align:start position:0%
in 2019 they went along with that
 
01:12:42.229 --> 01:12:42.239 align:start position:0%
compromise we had the bill passed now
 
01:12:43.750 --> 01:12:43.760 align:start position:0%
they're against it and i can tell you
 
01:12:46.070 --> 01:12:46.080 align:start position:0%
singularly they are because of the new
 
01:12:49.750 --> 01:12:49.760 align:start position:0%
rules that have to do with the december
 
01:12:52.870 --> 01:12:52.880 align:start position:0%
2019 passage of the wetland rules which
 
01:12:55.110 --> 01:12:55.120 align:start position:0%
elevates prime wetlands to a priority
 
01:12:56.709 --> 01:12:56.719 align:start position:0%
resource area
 
01:12:58.229 --> 01:12:58.239 align:start position:0%
that's why they're opposing this it's
 
01:13:00.229 --> 01:13:00.239 align:start position:0%
not because of the prime wetlands itself
 
01:13:02.870 --> 01:13:02.880 align:start position:0%
it's because they're now pras
 
01:13:05.189 --> 01:13:05.199 align:start position:0%
i understand those concerns i work on
 
01:13:06.550 --> 01:13:06.560 align:start position:0%
both sides of the fed i work for
 
01:13:08.950 --> 01:13:08.960 align:start position:0%
development and i work for conservation
 
01:13:10.709 --> 01:13:10.719 align:start position:0%
but i would underscore the fact that
 
01:13:10.719 --> 01:13:11.590 align:start position:0%
but i would underscore the fact that
this

01:13:11.590 --> 01:13:11.600 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:13:15.110 --> 01:13:15.120 align:start position:0%
bill is really the only key to allowing
 
01:13:16.830 --> 01:13:16.840 align:start position:0%
towns to
 
01:13:19.350 --> 01:13:19.360 align:start position:0%
voluntarily designate their highest and
 
01:13:21.750 --> 01:13:21.760 align:start position:0%
best wetlands for the functional values
 
01:13:24.149 --> 01:13:24.159 align:start position:0%
that continue to serve the populace of
 
01:13:26.390 --> 01:13:26.400 align:start position:0%
the state of new hampshire and with that
 
01:13:28.310 --> 01:13:28.320 align:start position:0%
i will conclude my remarks i thank you
 
01:13:30.550 --> 01:13:30.560 align:start position:0%
for your time and be happy to answer any
 
01:13:32.550 --> 01:13:32.560 align:start position:0%

the four floor is yours thank you very
 
01:14:27.830 --> 01:14:27.840 align:start position:0%
much mr chairman and members of the
 
01:14:30.390 --> 01:14:30.400 align:start position:0%
committee i'm ari pollock of gallagher

callahan and gartrell
 
01:14:34.229 --> 01:14:34.239 align:start position:0%
i'm here this morning on behalf of the
 
01:14:35.990 --> 01:14:36.000 align:start position:0%
homebuilders association of new
 
01:14:39.910 --> 01:14:39.920 align:start position:0%
hampshire the association opposes hb 158
 
01:14:41.750 --> 01:14:41.760 align:start position:0%
largely for the reasons mentioned by
 
01:14:43.910 --> 01:14:43.920 align:start position:0%
gary abbott of the agc
 
01:14:45.669 --> 01:14:45.679 align:start position:0%
we also oppose the bill for the same
 
01:14:48.870 --> 01:14:48.880 align:start position:0%
reasons we opposed house bill 326 which
 
01:14:51.030 --> 01:14:51.040 align:start position:0%
you heard earlier had been vetoed and
 
01:14:53.910 --> 01:14:53.920 align:start position:0%
house bill 1124 which you heard earlier
 
01:14:55.430 --> 01:14:55.440 align:start position:0%
had been tabled
 
01:14:57.830 --> 01:14:57.840 align:start position:0%
we appreciate that the bill includes
 
01:15:00.470 --> 01:15:00.480 align:start position:0%
prior compromises that were discussed
 
01:15:03.270 --> 01:15:03.280 align:start position:0%
along the legislative trail
 
01:15:05.189 --> 01:15:05.199 align:start position:0%
but we opposed the bill then and we
 
01:15:06.790 --> 01:15:06.800 align:start position:0%
still do now
 
01:15:08.709 --> 01:15:08.719 align:start position:0%
in short the bill puts otherwise
 
01:15:11.189 --> 01:15:11.199 align:start position:0%
developable land farther off the table
 
01:15:12.950 --> 01:15:12.960 align:start position:0%
for development
 
01:15:14.870 --> 01:15:14.880 align:start position:0%
development in wetlands in new hampshire
 
01:15:17.590 --> 01:15:17.600 align:start position:0%
already requires a permit regulated by
 
01:15:19.350 --> 01:15:19.360 align:start position:0%
the state new
 
01:15:21.830 --> 01:15:21.840 align:start position:0%
department of environmental services and
 
01:15:23.990 --> 01:15:24.000 align:start position:0%
this process already provides for a
 
01:15:26.950 --> 01:15:26.960 align:start position:0%
discussion with regulators about how
 
01:15:29.030 --> 01:15:29.040 align:start position:0%
proposed impacts can be
 
01:15:31.510 --> 01:15:31.520 align:start position:0%
minimized and avoided and where not
 
01:15:34.070 --> 01:15:34.080 align:start position:0%
minimized or avoided mitigated and
 
01:15:36.149 --> 01:15:36.159 align:start position:0%
frankly whether the mitigation proposal
 
01:15:39.030 --> 01:15:39.040 align:start position:0%
is ultimately sufficient municipalities
 
01:15:41.189 --> 01:15:41.199 align:start position:0%
and usually speaking through their
 
01:15:43.110 --> 01:15:43.120 align:start position:0%
conservation commission
 
01:15:45.189 --> 01:15:45.199 align:start position:0%
are notified of wetlands applications
 
01:15:46.870 --> 01:15:46.880 align:start position:0%
and they already have a voice in this
 
01:15:49.510 --> 01:15:49.520 align:start position:0%
process and des is already able to
 
01:15:52.470 --> 01:15:52.480 align:start position:0%
consider that voice and those opinions
 
01:15:54.709 --> 01:15:54.719 align:start position:0%
developers understand frankly and home
 
01:15:56.870 --> 01:15:56.880 align:start position:0%
builders in particular that mitigation
 
01:15:58.470 --> 01:15:58.480 align:start position:0%
doesn't always work
 
01:15:59.910 --> 01:15:59.920 align:start position:0%
and that sometimes even the most
 
01:16:01.270 --> 01:16:01.280 align:start position:0%
thoughtful and professional of
 
01:16:03.350 --> 01:16:03.360 align:start position:0%
applications are denied
 
01:16:05.270 --> 01:16:05.280 align:start position:0%
development in new hampshire is a hard
 
01:16:07.510 --> 01:16:07.520 align:start position:0%
enough process already and this bill
 
01:16:09.669 --> 01:16:09.679 align:start position:0%
puts another thumb on the scale against
 
01:16:11.430 --> 01:16:11.440 align:start position:0%
the opportunity for
 
01:16:13.750 --> 01:16:13.760 align:start position:0%
responsible development the bill would
 
01:16:16.390 --> 01:16:16.400 align:start position:0%
apply to private land and for
 
01:16:18.229 --> 01:16:18.239 align:start position:0%
designated areas
 
01:16:20.790 --> 01:16:20.800 align:start position:0%
would add hurdles to permitting
 
01:16:23.189 --> 01:16:23.199 align:start position:0%
supporters have mentioned on a couple of
 
01:16:25.189 --> 01:16:25.199 align:start position:0%
occasions that the wetland designation
 
01:16:28.310 --> 01:16:28.320 align:start position:0%
as prime is voluntary i would suggest
 
01:16:30.229 --> 01:16:30.239 align:start position:0%
for you that it isn't voluntary for the
 
01:16:32.709 --> 01:16:32.719 align:start position:0%
landowner who may be in the unfortunate
 
01:16:34.870 --> 01:16:34.880 align:start position:0%
position of defending land rights
 
01:16:37.830 --> 01:16:37.840 align:start position:0%
against his or her municipal officers
 
01:16:39.750 --> 01:16:39.760 align:start position:0%
for the purpose of protecting those land
 
01:16:41.910 --> 01:16:41.920 align:start position:0%
rights and i'm sure you can all imagine
 
01:16:44.310 --> 01:16:44.320 align:start position:0%
that that's a tough a tough and uphill
 
01:16:44.320 --> 01:16:45.590 align:start position:0%
that that's a tough a tough and uphill
battle

01:16:45.590 --> 01:16:45.600 align:start position:0%
battle
 
01:16:48.390 --> 01:16:48.400 align:start position:0%
interestingly the bill exempts dot from
 
01:16:50.790 --> 01:16:50.800 align:start position:0%
these challenges and the extra hurdles
 
01:16:50.800 --> 01:16:51.830 align:start position:0%
these challenges and the extra hurdles
that

01:16:51.830 --> 01:16:51.840 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:16:53.910 --> 01:16:53.920 align:start position:0%
prime wetland designations
 
01:16:56.790 --> 01:16:56.800 align:start position:0%
would present and to me this means that
 
01:16:59.030 --> 01:16:59.040 align:start position:0%
development on public land is somehow
 
01:17:00.550 --> 01:17:00.560 align:start position:0%
more important than development on
 
01:17:02.870 --> 01:17:02.880 align:start position:0%
private land and frankly i don't see the
 
01:17:05.510 --> 01:17:05.520 align:start position:0%
difference rules are rules
 
01:17:08.870 --> 01:17:08.880 align:start position:0%
if there are only 30 plus municipalities
 
01:17:11.590 --> 01:17:11.600 align:start position:0%
uh taking advantage of this opportunity
 
01:17:13.590 --> 01:17:13.600 align:start position:0%
and that amounts to
 
01:17:17.830 --> 01:17:17.840 align:start position:0%
less than a quarter of a percent of land
 
01:17:19.910 --> 01:17:19.920 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure throwing another curveball
 
01:17:21.590 --> 01:17:21.600 align:start position:0%
at development
 
01:17:24.790 --> 01:17:24.800 align:start position:0%
is necessary when a housing and
 
01:17:27.189 --> 01:17:27.199 align:start position:0%
workforce crisis already exists in new
 
01:17:29.110 --> 01:17:29.120 align:start position:0%
hampshire and there are already many
 
01:17:31.430 --> 01:17:31.440 align:start position:0%
initiatives underway to try and bridge
 
01:17:34.950 --> 01:17:34.960 align:start position:0%
that gap and that crisis
 
01:17:37.110 --> 01:17:37.120 align:start position:0%
lastly we think there's quite a bit of
 
01:17:39.030 --> 01:17:39.040 align:start position:0%
room for expert disagreement over
 
01:17:41.189 --> 01:17:41.199 align:start position:0%
wetlands characteristics
 
01:17:42.870 --> 01:17:42.880 align:start position:0%
and whether a wetland is quote
 
01:17:46.630 --> 01:17:46.640 align:start position:0%
significant contributing or contributory
 
01:17:48.550 --> 01:17:48.560 align:start position:0%
these disagreements can be lengthy
 
01:17:51.910 --> 01:17:51.920 align:start position:0%
costly unpredictable and private land
 
01:17:53.430 --> 01:17:53.440 align:start position:0%
rights are hanging in the balance
 
01:17:55.590 --> 01:17:55.600 align:start position:0%
throughout this discussion for all these
 
01:17:57.189 --> 01:17:57.199 align:start position:0%
reasons the home builders ask as they
 
01:17:59.110 --> 01:17:59.120 align:start position:0%
have in the past that
 
01:18:01.590 --> 01:18:01.600 align:start position:0%

there are a couple of things i've heard
 
01:19:44.149 --> 01:19:44.159 align:start position:0%
that i want to clarify keep this short
 
01:19:45.590 --> 01:19:45.600 align:start position:0%
not repeat a lot of what you've already
 
01:19:45.600 --> 01:19:47.830 align:start position:0%
not repeat a lot of what you've already
heard

01:19:47.830 --> 01:19:47.840 align:start position:0%
heard
 
01:19:49.590 --> 01:19:49.600 align:start position:0%
a prime wetland is intended to be the
 
01:19:51.510 --> 01:19:51.520 align:start position:0%
best of the best wetland systems always
 
01:19:52.950 --> 01:19:52.960 align:start position:0%
has been
 
01:19:56.229 --> 01:19:56.239 align:start position:0%
the expansion to cover narrower areas
 
01:19:58.470 --> 01:19:58.480 align:start position:0%
will include wetlands that are not at
 
01:20:00.630 --> 01:20:00.640 align:start position:0%
that same level
 
01:20:03.110 --> 01:20:03.120 align:start position:0%
and they were not ever actually included
 
01:20:05.110 --> 01:20:05.120 align:start position:0%
in the past as was mentioned uh
 
01:20:05.120 --> 01:20:06.550 align:start position:0%
in the past as was mentioned uh
previously

01:20:06.550 --> 01:20:06.560 align:start position:0%
previously
 
01:20:08.229 --> 01:20:08.239 align:start position:0%
the the issue was the definition of
 
01:20:09.910 --> 01:20:09.920 align:start position:0%
prime wetland initially it was based on
 
01:20:11.990 --> 01:20:12.000 align:start position:0%
very poorly drained soils
 
01:20:14.229 --> 01:20:14.239 align:start position:0%
and it was recognized that there were
 
01:20:15.750 --> 01:20:15.760 align:start position:0%
plenty of areas
 
01:20:18.950 --> 01:20:18.960 align:start position:0%
that were large wetland systems
 
01:20:20.870 --> 01:20:20.880 align:start position:0%
that would include very poorly drained
 
01:20:22.790 --> 01:20:22.800 align:start position:0%
and poorly drained soils
 
01:20:25.510 --> 01:20:25.520 align:start position:0%
so that definition was changed in part
 
01:20:27.590 --> 01:20:27.600 align:start position:0%
as rick van de pol spoke
 
01:20:29.110 --> 01:20:29.120 align:start position:0%
because you can't get out and delineate
 
01:20:31.110 --> 01:20:31.120 align:start position:0%
between a poorly and very poorly out in
 
01:20:34.149 --> 01:20:34.159 align:start position:0%
a deep a deep wet area
 
01:20:36.310 --> 01:20:36.320 align:start position:0%
but then there needed to be the uh
 
01:20:38.149 --> 01:20:38.159 align:start position:0%
clarification of how far would those
 
01:20:40.310 --> 01:20:40.320 align:start position:0%
very poorly i'm sorry would those prime
 
01:20:43.030 --> 01:20:43.040 align:start position:0%
wetland areas extend and that's where
 
01:20:45.270 --> 01:20:45.280 align:start position:0%
the concept of the 50-foot cut-off came
 
01:20:45.280 --> 01:20:46.870 align:start position:0%
the concept of the 50-foot cut-off came
in

01:20:46.870 --> 01:20:46.880 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:20:48.149 --> 01:20:48.159 align:start position:0%
certainly there could be discussion
 
01:20:49.750 --> 01:20:49.760 align:start position:0%
about whether that number
 
01:20:51.270 --> 01:20:51.280 align:start position:0%
needs to change
 
01:20:53.110 --> 01:20:53.120 align:start position:0%
maybe it gets lessened
 
01:20:55.510 --> 01:20:55.520 align:start position:0%
but the idea to open this up to all
 
01:20:58.149 --> 01:20:58.159 align:start position:0%
these narrow fingers and toes as they're
 
01:20:58.159 --> 01:20:59.590 align:start position:0%
these narrow fingers and toes as they're
called

01:20:59.590 --> 01:20:59.600 align:start position:0%
called
 
01:21:01.430 --> 01:21:01.440 align:start position:0%
becomes a more difficult issue of
 
01:21:03.590 --> 01:21:03.600 align:start position:0%
expansion we believe is an appropriate
 
01:21:05.990 --> 01:21:06.000 align:start position:0%
expansion of the prime wetland
 
01:21:07.990 --> 01:21:08.000 align:start position:0%
areas of being the best of the best
 
01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:09.350 align:start position:0%
areas of being the best of the best
systems

01:21:09.350 --> 01:21:09.360 align:start position:0%
systems
 
01:21:12.790 --> 01:21:12.800 align:start position:0%
the designated methodology being used to
 
01:21:15.110 --> 01:21:15.120 align:start position:0%
assess prime wetland functions
 
01:21:18.070 --> 01:21:18.080 align:start position:0%
is a an assessment methodology called
 
01:21:19.830 --> 01:21:19.840 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire method
 
01:21:21.590 --> 01:21:21.600 align:start position:0%
and it's not that
 
01:21:23.910 --> 01:21:23.920 align:start position:0%
des has 12 criteria it's the new
 
01:21:26.470 --> 01:21:26.480 align:start position:0%
hampshire method has these criteria and
 
01:21:28.070 --> 01:21:28.080 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire method is designated
 
01:21:29.750 --> 01:21:29.760 align:start position:0%
to be used to designate these prime
 
01:21:31.270 --> 01:21:31.280 align:start position:0%
wetland areas
 
01:21:33.350 --> 01:21:33.360 align:start position:0%
the uh the only thing is that the new
 
01:21:35.110 --> 01:21:35.120 align:start position:0%
hampshire method wasn't designed for
 
01:21:36.470 --> 01:21:36.480 align:start position:0%
this purpose
 
01:21:39.110 --> 01:21:39.120 align:start position:0%
and it wasn't designed to uh be
 
01:21:41.590 --> 01:21:41.600 align:start position:0%
evaluating systems that are
 
01:21:43.910 --> 01:21:43.920 align:start position:0%
under two acres in size
 
01:21:45.430 --> 01:21:45.440 align:start position:0%
which is the issue you'll get into if
 
01:21:47.110 --> 01:21:47.120 align:start position:0%
you start to bring in these narrower
 
01:21:49.430 --> 01:21:49.440 align:start position:0%
areas and attempt to be using it to
 
01:21:51.110 --> 01:21:51.120 align:start position:0%
designate the function values of those
 
01:21:51.120 --> 01:21:52.790 align:start position:0%
designate the function values of those
areas

01:21:52.790 --> 01:21:52.800 align:start position:0%
areas
 
01:21:52.800 --> 01:21:54.390 align:start position:0%
areas
so

01:21:54.390 --> 01:21:54.400 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:21:56.470 --> 01:21:56.480 align:start position:0%
narrow drainage areas really need to
 
01:22:00.310 --> 01:22:00.320 align:start position:0%
have a different type of valuation
 
01:22:02.310 --> 01:22:02.320 align:start position:0%
so in order to maintain protection of
 
01:22:05.189 --> 01:22:05.199 align:start position:0%
the prime wetland areas the idea was is
 
01:22:07.590 --> 01:22:07.600 align:start position:0%
that crop any crossings that need to be
 
01:22:10.550 --> 01:22:10.560 align:start position:0%
utilized to access adjacent lands
 
01:22:12.470 --> 01:22:12.480 align:start position:0%
for allowable usages
 
01:22:14.950 --> 01:22:14.960 align:start position:0%
adjacent to these primal areas these
 
01:22:17.430 --> 01:22:17.440 align:start position:0%
narrower smaller areas would be the
 
01:22:20.310 --> 01:22:20.320 align:start position:0%
appropriate location to put any approved
 
01:22:22.390 --> 01:22:22.400 align:start position:0%
crossings to be applied for through the
 
01:22:23.669 --> 01:22:23.679 align:start position:0%
wetlands bureau
 
01:22:25.189 --> 01:22:25.199 align:start position:0%
so there's still protection of all these
 
01:22:27.030 --> 01:22:27.040 align:start position:0%
wetlands through the process of the
 
01:22:29.030 --> 01:22:29.040 align:start position:0%
permitting but if you take away and you
 
01:22:30.629 --> 01:22:30.639 align:start position:0%
add all these narrow areas into the
 
01:22:32.390 --> 01:22:32.400 align:start position:0%
prime wetlands you now have an issue of
 
01:22:34.870 --> 01:22:34.880 align:start position:0%
where are you going to cross
 
01:22:36.870 --> 01:22:36.880 align:start position:0%
to access these lands
 
01:22:38.229 --> 01:22:38.239 align:start position:0%
you no longer have a distinction in the
 
01:22:40.790 --> 01:22:40.800 align:start position:0%
designation between the best of the best
 
01:22:43.270 --> 01:22:43.280 align:start position:0%
and these narrow channels
 
01:22:47.189 --> 01:22:47.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:49.030 --> 01:22:49.040 align:start position:0%
now it's also important to recognize is
 
01:22:51.430 --> 01:22:51.440 align:start position:0%
that local communities can establish
 
01:22:53.189 --> 01:22:53.199 align:start position:0%
their own rules and protections over
 
01:22:54.790 --> 01:22:54.800 align:start position:0%
wetland systems and quite many of them
 
01:22:54.800 --> 01:22:55.910 align:start position:0%
wetland systems and quite many of them
do

01:22:55.910 --> 01:22:55.920 align:start position:0%
do
 
01:22:59.350 --> 01:22:59.360 align:start position:0%
the wetlands bureau system of permitting
 
01:23:01.669 --> 01:23:01.679 align:start position:0%
has very specific requirements of
 
01:23:03.510 --> 01:23:03.520 align:start position:0%
protection and the towns can increase
 
01:23:06.390 --> 01:23:06.400 align:start position:0%
the requirements at their will
 
01:23:07.669 --> 01:23:07.679 align:start position:0%
if they wish to
 
01:23:09.830 --> 01:23:09.840 align:start position:0%
so they can add buffers they can add
 
01:23:11.910 --> 01:23:11.920 align:start position:0%
greater protections in areas and that's
 
01:23:13.830 --> 01:23:13.840 align:start position:0%
our recommendation as the method to
 
01:23:16.790 --> 01:23:16.800 align:start position:0%
protect these areas in question would be
 
01:23:19.110 --> 01:23:19.120 align:start position:0%
to encourage local communities in more
 
01:23:22.149 --> 01:23:22.159 align:start position:0%
specific circumstances to protect those
 
01:23:24.229 --> 01:23:24.239 align:start position:0%
specific areas that they're looking to
 
01:23:24.239 --> 01:23:25.030 align:start position:0%
specific areas that they're looking to
have

01:23:25.030 --> 01:23:25.040 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:23:27.030 --> 01:23:27.040 align:start position:0%
increased protection over
 
01:23:29.110 --> 01:23:29.120 align:start position:0%
that way you're not encumbering all the
 
01:23:30.310 --> 01:23:30.320 align:start position:0%
prime wellness throughout the state of
 
01:23:31.430 --> 01:23:31.440 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
01:23:34.709 --> 01:23:34.719 align:start position:0%
with this expansion of the designation
 
01:23:36.229 --> 01:23:36.239 align:start position:0%
now the uh
 
01:23:38.070 --> 01:23:38.080 align:start position:0%
it was mentioned that minimal areas have
 
01:23:39.590 --> 01:23:39.600 align:start position:0%
been affected up to this point i think
 
01:23:41.910 --> 01:23:41.920 align:start position:0%
rick said 0.17 percent
 
01:23:43.750 --> 01:23:43.760 align:start position:0%
uh but be clear that if you do change
 
01:23:46.229 --> 01:23:46.239 align:start position:0%
the rules the way this bill does that
 
01:23:48.390 --> 01:23:48.400 align:start position:0%
number will shoot through the roof and
 
01:23:50.310 --> 01:23:50.320 align:start position:0%
increase significantly because of the
 
01:23:51.590 --> 01:23:51.600 align:start position:0%
expansion of the prime mountain
 
01:23:51.600 --> 01:23:52.790 align:start position:0%
expansion of the prime mountain
designation

01:23:52.790 --> 01:23:52.800 align:start position:0%
designation
 
01:23:54.149 --> 01:23:54.159 align:start position:0%
that's our belief and that's our
 
01:23:56.550 --> 01:23:56.560 align:start position:0%
testimony as association natural
 
01:23:58.229 --> 01:23:58.239 align:start position:0%
resource scientists
 
01:23:59.750 --> 01:23:59.760 align:start position:0%
thank you and if you have any questions
 
01:24:01.990 --> 01:24:02.000 align:start position:0%
i'll be glad to entertain them thank you
 
01:24:03.830 --> 01:24:03.840 align:start position:0%
with any questions from members of the
 
01:24:03.840 --> 01:24:05.669 align:start position:0%
with any questions from members of the
committee

01:24:05.669 --> 01:24:05.679 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:24:08.550 --> 01:24:08.560 align:start position:0%
sure so i see no questions there being
 
01:24:10.149 --> 01:24:10.159 align:start position:0%
none thank you very much
 
01:24:11.910 --> 01:24:11.920 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:24:15.910 --> 01:24:15.920 align:start position:0%
uh final person uh like maybe two people
 
01:24:18.070 --> 01:24:18.080 align:start position:0%
uh christopher albert
 
01:24:18.080 --> 01:24:19.669 align:start position:0%
uh christopher albert
um

01:24:19.669 --> 01:24:19.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:24:19.679 --> 01:24:21.910 align:start position:0%
um
neutral

01:24:21.910 --> 01:24:21.920 align:start position:0%
neutral
 
01:24:23.430 --> 01:24:23.440 align:start position:0%
mr uh
 
01:24:25.910 --> 01:24:25.920 align:start position:0%
dr albert
 
01:24:27.590 --> 01:24:27.600 align:start position:0%
are you there
 
01:24:29.510 --> 01:24:29.520 align:start position:0%
he's up
 
01:24:31.830 --> 01:24:31.840 align:start position:0%
right mr albert
 
01:24:34.550 --> 01:24:34.560 align:start position:0%
i think you have to
 
01:24:38.229 --> 01:24:38.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:40.149 --> 01:24:40.159 align:start position:0%
my hair there i am
 
01:24:42.790 --> 01:24:42.800 align:start position:0%
all right mr thank you
 
01:24:44.470 --> 01:24:44.480 align:start position:0%
members of the committee thank you yeah
 
01:24:46.550 --> 01:24:46.560 align:start position:0%
it is kind of where it takes it out and
 
01:24:48.790 --> 01:24:48.800 align:start position:0%
back in again again for the record uh my
 
01:24:51.430 --> 01:24:51.440 align:start position:0%
name is uh chris albert owner of csa
 
01:24:53.990 --> 01:24:54.000 align:start position:0%
environmental consultants i'm a licensed
 
01:24:55.669 --> 01:24:55.679 align:start position:0%
wetland scientist
 
01:24:59.430 --> 01:24:59.440 align:start position:0%
uh i was part of nanners back in 2017
 
01:25:01.430 --> 01:25:01.440 align:start position:0%
when we did the uh
 
01:25:03.189 --> 01:25:03.199 align:start position:0%
the buffer uh
 
01:25:05.669 --> 01:25:05.679 align:start position:0%
workshops uh documents that are being
 
01:25:07.189 --> 01:25:07.199 align:start position:0%
referenced today
 
01:25:10.470 --> 01:25:10.480 align:start position:0%
and i also teach at the t2 class the
 
01:25:13.590 --> 01:25:13.600 align:start position:0%
culvert certification class for uh d.o.t
 
01:25:15.830 --> 01:25:15.840 align:start position:0%
and road agents so again i'm mixed on
 
01:25:17.990 --> 01:25:18.000 align:start position:0%
this legislative process
 
01:25:21.270 --> 01:25:21.280 align:start position:0%
again uh i item 1d
 
01:25:24.550 --> 01:25:24.560 align:start position:0%
uh as far as the uh
 
01:25:26.470 --> 01:25:26.480 align:start position:0%
exemptions for work within those
 
01:25:29.910 --> 01:25:29.920 align:start position:0%
roadways that that is very key for d.o.t
 
01:25:32.629 --> 01:25:32.639 align:start position:0%
and the road agents uh trying to do any
 
01:25:34.310 --> 01:25:34.320 align:start position:0%
type of roadway work
 
01:25:36.870 --> 01:25:36.880 align:start position:0%
adjacent to these prime wetlands again a
 
01:25:39.830 --> 01:25:39.840 align:start position:0%
lot of it got taken out in
 
01:25:41.590 --> 01:25:41.600 align:start position:0%
with the legislative process but it's
 
01:25:43.270 --> 01:25:43.280 align:start position:0%
good that we've got some stiff language
 
01:25:45.750 --> 01:25:45.760 align:start position:0%
in there to reiterate that
 
01:25:47.990 --> 01:25:48.000 align:start position:0%
um i did do a project for the town of
 
01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:48.950 align:start position:0%
um i did do a project for the town of
beau

01:25:48.950 --> 01:25:48.960 align:start position:0%
beau
 
01:25:51.910 --> 01:25:51.920 align:start position:0%
on bulldog road back before 2012 and it
 
01:25:51.920 --> 01:25:53.030 align:start position:0%
on bulldog road back before 2012 and it
took

01:25:53.030 --> 01:25:53.040 align:start position:0%
took
 
01:25:55.430 --> 01:25:55.440 align:start position:0%
months to get my permitting through just
 
01:25:57.350 --> 01:25:57.360 align:start position:0%
to work on a roadway with the jason
 
01:25:59.110 --> 01:25:59.120 align:start position:0%
wetlands so again
 
01:26:02.870 --> 01:26:02.880 align:start position:0%
item 1d is important legislative process
 
01:26:04.870 --> 01:26:04.880 align:start position:0%
that needs to be in there
 
01:26:06.229 --> 01:26:06.239 align:start position:0%
again i do
 
01:26:09.110 --> 01:26:09.120 align:start position:0%
work as far as uh do concur with uh mike
 
01:26:13.030 --> 01:26:13.040 align:start position:0%
croissant and uh nanners that uh 1b
 
01:26:15.990 --> 01:26:16.000 align:start position:0%
uh should be stricken uh from the
 
01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:17.110 align:start position:0%
uh should be stricken uh from the
amendment

01:26:17.110 --> 01:26:17.120 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
01:26:19.350 --> 01:26:19.360 align:start position:0%
again it's going to add lots of little
 
01:26:19.360 --> 01:26:20.550 align:start position:0%
again it's going to add lots of little
fingers

01:26:20.550 --> 01:26:20.560 align:start position:0%
fingers
 
01:26:22.550 --> 01:26:22.560 align:start position:0%
uh we have no idea
 
01:26:24.550 --> 01:26:24.560 align:start position:0%
how many other wetlands this would
 
01:26:26.950 --> 01:26:26.960 align:start position:0%
involve getting pulled into the
 
01:26:29.350 --> 01:26:29.360 align:start position:0%
prime wetland aspect so again i
 
01:26:31.189 --> 01:26:31.199 align:start position:0%
just wanted to state my concern on these
 
01:26:33.990 --> 01:26:34.000 align:start position:0%
two aspects uh again i'm
 
01:26:35.990 --> 01:26:36.000 align:start position:0%
in favor of one aspect of the bill and
 
01:26:37.669 --> 01:26:37.679 align:start position:0%
against the other aspect
 
01:26:39.590 --> 01:26:39.600 align:start position:0%
and again i'll take any questions thank
 
01:26:41.270 --> 01:26:41.280 align:start position:0%
you for your time
 
01:26:43.510 --> 01:26:43.520 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions by members of
 
01:26:45.030 --> 01:26:45.040 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
01:26:47.189 --> 01:26:47.199 align:start position:0%
sir i see no questions there being no
 
01:26:49.189 --> 01:26:49.199 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much for your
 
01:26:49.199 --> 01:26:50.709 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much for your
testimony

01:26:50.709 --> 01:26:50.719 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
01:26:53.750 --> 01:26:53.760 align:start position:0%
uh finally uh

was

01:27:03.270 --> 01:27:03.280 align:start position:0%
was
 
01:27:06.149 --> 01:27:06.159 align:start position:0%
not certain if you wish to testify
 
01:27:08.950 --> 01:27:08.960 align:start position:0%
i know you're it's the name email
 
01:27:12.870 --> 01:27:12.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:14.870 --> 01:27:14.880 align:start position:0%
of gamache
 
01:27:18.470 --> 01:27:18.480 align:start position:0%
uh are you there are you on she's up she
 
01:27:24.790 --> 01:27:24.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:29.430 --> 01:27:29.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:30.830 --> 01:27:30.840 align:start position:0%
are you
 
01:27:34.229 --> 01:27:34.239 align:start position:0%
there donna gamache are you there
 
01:27:36.229 --> 01:27:36.239 align:start position:0%
so she's up but she's muted you are
 
01:27:36.239 --> 01:27:40.470 align:start position:0%
so she's up but she's muted you are
muted

01:27:40.470 --> 01:27:40.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:43.189 --> 01:27:43.199 align:start position:0%
you are muted
 
01:27:58.070 --> 01:27:58.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:00.870 --> 01:28:00.880 align:start position:0%
you put your camera on okay let me get
 
01:28:03.270 --> 01:28:03.280 align:start position:0%
my camera on no let me see hold on one
 
01:28:03.280 --> 01:28:06.229 align:start position:0%
my camera on no let me see hold on one
second

01:28:06.229 --> 01:28:06.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:08.709 --> 01:28:08.719 align:start position:0%
trying to open up i had i was
 
01:28:11.110 --> 01:28:11.120 align:start position:0%
doing can't seem to open my screen to
 
01:28:13.350 --> 01:28:13.360 align:start position:0%
make it larger so that i can put my
 
01:28:14.629 --> 01:28:14.639 align:start position:0%
camera on
 
01:28:14.639 --> 01:28:15.750 align:start position:0%
camera on
so

01:28:15.750 --> 01:28:15.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:28:18.870 --> 01:28:18.880 align:start position:0%
you can testify uh you know we see your
 
01:28:21.910 --> 01:28:21.920 align:start position:0%
name but we'd rather hear you than
 
01:28:24.790 --> 01:28:24.800 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i'm very sorry and i only
 
01:28:26.550 --> 01:28:26.560 align:start position:0%
signed in in opposition and sent a
 
01:28:28.629 --> 01:28:28.639 align:start position:0%
letter to the committee because my
 
01:28:31.510 --> 01:28:31.520 align:start position:0%
wetlands expert could not join me today
 
01:28:34.629 --> 01:28:34.639 align:start position:0%
so we are opposed for multiple reasons i
 
01:28:38.629 --> 01:28:38.639 align:start position:0%
can i could get my wetlands expert um to
 
01:28:40.470 --> 01:28:40.480 align:start position:0%
share more with you but i couldn't get
 
01:28:42.149 --> 01:28:42.159 align:start position:0%
him to join me which is why i did not
 
01:28:44.550 --> 01:28:44.560 align:start position:0%
sign in to testify and i i'm sorry to do
 
01:28:48.950 --> 01:28:48.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:51.669 --> 01:28:51.679 align:start position:0%
probably if you wish just
 
01:28:53.430 --> 01:28:53.440 align:start position:0%
have them put something in writing and
 
01:28:55.590 --> 01:28:55.600 align:start position:0%
send it to the committee i will get more
 
01:28:57.189 --> 01:28:57.199 align:start position:0%
detail from him to the committee thank
 
01:29:00.870 --> 01:29:00.880 align:start position:0%
you for that thank you very much
 
01:29:02.390 --> 01:29:02.400 align:start position:0%
is there anyone else who wishes to
 
01:29:02.400 --> 01:29:06.629 align:start position:0%
is there anyone else who wishes to
testify

01:29:06.629 --> 01:29:06.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:08.229 --> 01:29:08.239 align:start position:0%
there are no other hands
 
01:29:10.470 --> 01:29:10.480 align:start position:0%
there being no no one else wishing to
 
01:29:10.480 --> 01:29:11.830 align:start position:0%
there being no no one else wishing to
testify

01:29:11.830 --> 01:29:11.840 align:start position:0%
testify
 
01:29:15.270 --> 01:29:15.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:17.189 --> 01:29:17.199 align:start position:0%
close the hearing on
 
01:29:19.830 --> 01:29:19.840 align:start position:0%

thank you mr chair and
 
01:29:54.950 --> 01:29:54.960 align:start position:0%
members of the committee wherever you

may be
 
01:29:58.470 --> 01:29:58.480 align:start position:0%
um how the
 
01:30:01.510 --> 01:30:01.520 align:start position:0%
this bill is the result of the work of
 
01:30:04.229 --> 01:30:04.239 align:start position:0%
the shoreline septic system study
 
01:30:04.239 --> 01:30:05.590 align:start position:0%

commission

01:30:05.590 --> 01:30:05.600 align:start position:0%
commission
 
01:30:07.830 --> 01:30:07.840 align:start position:0%
of which i was the chair uh it was a
 
01:30:09.910 --> 01:30:09.920 align:start position:0%
two-year commission and
 
01:30:12.790 --> 01:30:12.800 align:start position:0%
very well representative of of uh
 
01:30:15.669 --> 01:30:15.679 align:start position:0%
municipal people developers
 
01:30:15.679 --> 01:30:16.550 align:start position:0%
municipal people developers
uh

01:30:16.550 --> 01:30:16.560 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:30:18.830 --> 01:30:18.840 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
01:30:23.030 --> 01:30:23.040 align:start position:0%
septic evaluators and assessors
 
01:30:25.590 --> 01:30:25.600 align:start position:0%
um and of course conservationists who
 
01:30:27.669 --> 01:30:27.679 align:start position:0%
are interested in protecting surface
 
01:30:27.679 --> 01:30:28.870 align:start position:0%
are interested in protecting surface
waters

01:30:28.870 --> 01:30:28.880 align:start position:0%
waters
 
01:30:32.310 --> 01:30:32.320 align:start position:0%
90 of the commission members voted to
 
01:30:32.320 --> 01:30:33.430 align:start position:0%
90 of the commission members voted to
accept

01:30:33.430 --> 01:30:33.440 align:start position:0%
accept
 
01:30:36.790 --> 01:30:36.800 align:start position:0%
the commission's recommendations
 
01:30:39.270 --> 01:30:39.280 align:start position:0%
it was established to address the
 
01:30:42.070 --> 01:30:42.080 align:start position:0%
critical and difficult challenge
 
01:30:44.950 --> 01:30:44.960 align:start position:0%
of the threat to water quality biseptic
 
01:30:47.590 --> 01:30:47.600 align:start position:0%
systems particularly the older ones that
 
01:30:49.750 --> 01:30:49.760 align:start position:0%
are located close to
 
01:30:51.669 --> 01:30:51.679 align:start position:0%
surface waters
 
01:30:53.510 --> 01:30:53.520 align:start position:0%
when we were doing our studies they
 
01:30:55.990 --> 01:30:56.000 align:start position:0%
presented that a significant proportion
 
01:30:58.229 --> 01:30:58.239 align:start position:0%
of the polluted pollution of lakes and
 
01:31:02.229 --> 01:31:02.239 align:start position:0%
ponds and rivers can be attributed to
 
01:31:05.350 --> 01:31:05.360 align:start position:0%
underperforming septic systems
 
01:31:05.360 --> 01:31:06.189 align:start position:0%
underperforming septic systems
in

01:31:06.189 --> 01:31:06.199 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:31:10.229 --> 01:31:10.239 align:start position:0%
1967 statutes were were instituted that
 
01:31:12.790 --> 01:31:12.800 align:start position:0%
require that state permits be
 
01:31:15.669 --> 01:31:15.679 align:start position:0%
obtained for a septic system
 
01:31:19.510 --> 01:31:19.520 align:start position:0%
but before 1967
 
01:31:20.709 --> 01:31:20.719 align:start position:0%
at the
 
01:31:23.590 --> 01:31:23.600 align:start position:0%
septic systems were not required to have
 
01:31:27.110 --> 01:31:27.120 align:start position:0%
any approval and they have had no state
 
01:31:29.590 --> 01:31:29.600 align:start position:0%
oversight ever since
 
01:31:32.149 --> 01:31:32.159 align:start position:0%
and for various reasons
 
01:31:34.629 --> 01:31:34.639 align:start position:0%
lack of maintenance is a big problem or
 
01:31:38.229 --> 01:31:38.239 align:start position:0%
changes more intensive intensive use of
 
01:31:38.239 --> 01:31:39.750 align:start position:0%
changes more intensive intensive use of
resonances

01:31:39.750 --> 01:31:39.760 align:start position:0%
resonances
 
01:31:39.760 --> 01:31:40.709 align:start position:0%
resonances
even

01:31:40.709 --> 01:31:40.719 align:start position:0%
even
 
01:31:44.070 --> 01:31:44.080 align:start position:0%
septic systems that were given permits
 
01:31:47.270 --> 01:31:47.280 align:start position:0%
since 1967 which you
 
01:31:50.790 --> 01:31:50.800 align:start position:0%
could calculate as over 50 years old may
 
01:31:53.350 --> 01:31:53.360 align:start position:0%
have since become inadequate
 
01:31:56.390 --> 01:31:56.400 align:start position:0%
and potential polluters of groundwater
 
01:31:58.550 --> 01:31:58.560 align:start position:0%
and surface water
 
01:31:58.560 --> 01:31:59.910 align:start position:0%
and surface water
ex

01:31:59.910 --> 01:31:59.920 align:start position:0%
ex
 
01:32:03.430 --> 01:32:03.440 align:start position:0%
the rub is that except when a property
 
01:32:06.310 --> 01:32:06.320 align:start position:0%
is expanded or is sold there are
 
01:32:09.270 --> 01:32:09.280 align:start position:0%
currently no regulatory means for
 
01:32:11.270 --> 01:32:11.280 align:start position:0%
discovering that they are a problem
 
01:32:12.550 --> 01:32:12.560 align:start position:0%
septic system
 
01:32:15.669 --> 01:32:15.679 align:start position:0%
far less requiring that they address
 
01:32:18.709 --> 01:32:18.719 align:start position:0%
so the commission um
 
01:32:21.510 --> 01:32:21.520 align:start position:0%
was looking for other options other than
 
01:32:24.390 --> 01:32:24.400 align:start position:0%
regulatory so we went to
 
01:32:28.629 --> 01:32:28.639 align:start position:0%
um the voluntary education
 
01:32:32.149 --> 01:32:32.159 align:start position:0%
financial incentives um
 
01:32:33.990 --> 01:32:34.000 align:start position:0%
and uh and working directly with
 
01:32:35.750 --> 01:32:35.760 align:start position:0%
landowners to see if we couldn't get
 
01:32:38.149 --> 01:32:38.159 align:start position:0%
landowners to take more responsibility
 
01:32:40.229 --> 01:32:40.239 align:start position:0%
for their systems
 
01:32:40.239 --> 01:32:41.430 align:start position:0%
for their systems
um

01:32:41.430 --> 01:32:41.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:32:41.440 --> 01:32:42.870 align:start position:0%
um
they

01:32:42.870 --> 01:32:42.880 align:start position:0%
they
 
01:32:44.149 --> 01:32:44.159 align:start position:0%
this was
 
01:32:47.430 --> 01:32:47.440 align:start position:0%
this was very successful in the areas
 
01:32:51.030 --> 01:32:51.040 align:start position:0%
where intensive work was done with the
 
01:32:51.040 --> 01:32:51.830 align:start position:0%
where intensive work was done with the
uh

01:32:51.830 --> 01:32:51.840 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:32:54.550 --> 01:32:54.560 align:start position:0%
with the landowners and on one new
 
01:32:55.910 --> 01:32:55.920 align:start position:0%
hampshire lake
 
01:32:58.550 --> 01:32:58.560 align:start position:0%
the blooms of dangerous cyanobacteria
 
01:33:02.470 --> 01:33:02.480 align:start position:0%
were completely wiped out by having a
 
01:33:06.070 --> 01:33:06.080 align:start position:0%
very high proportion of the landowners
 
01:33:08.070 --> 01:33:08.080 align:start position:0%
looking at their septic systems having
 
01:33:10.790 --> 01:33:10.800 align:start position:0%
them evaluated and having them repaired
 
01:33:14.470 --> 01:33:14.480 align:start position:0%
when necessary but this is clearly not
 
01:33:16.629 --> 01:33:16.639 align:start position:0%
a model for solving the problem
 
01:33:16.639 --> 01:33:19.350 align:start position:0%
a model for solving the problem
statewide

01:33:19.350 --> 01:33:19.360 align:start position:0%
statewide
 
01:33:23.430 --> 01:33:23.440 align:start position:0%
so um we we turn them to the option or
 
01:33:25.669 --> 01:33:25.679 align:start position:0%
the opportunity for when a pri when a
 
01:33:27.590 --> 01:33:27.600 align:start position:0%
septic system or a property is
 
01:33:29.910 --> 01:33:29.920 align:start position:0%
exchanging hands because there is
 
01:33:32.310 --> 01:33:32.320 align:start position:0%
already an assessment required for the
 
01:33:34.390 --> 01:33:34.400 align:start position:0%
site to make sure that it can
 
01:33:34.400 --> 01:33:36.229 align:start position:0%
site to make sure that it can
accommodate

01:33:36.229 --> 01:33:36.239 align:start position:0%
accommodate
 
01:33:40.310 --> 01:33:40.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:43.669 --> 01:33:43.679 align:start position:0%
the the rub is that
 
01:33:46.550 --> 01:33:46.560 align:start position:0%
the property if there's a system itself
 
01:33:49.270 --> 01:33:49.280 align:start position:0%
on the property there is right now no
 
01:33:50.470 --> 01:33:50.480 align:start position:0%
way that
 
01:33:53.590 --> 01:33:53.600 align:start position:0%
that system would be evaluated and
 
01:33:55.669 --> 01:33:55.679 align:start position:0%
somebody who is buying that property
 
01:33:57.990 --> 01:33:58.000 align:start position:0%
would have no idea that the septic
 
01:34:01.510 --> 01:34:01.520 align:start position:0%
system that is on it was substandard in
 
01:34:04.790 --> 01:34:04.800 align:start position:0%
terms of the building that is on us or
 
01:34:07.270 --> 01:34:07.280 align:start position:0%
what they are planning to put on it
 
01:34:07.280 --> 01:34:09.110 align:start position:0%
what they are planning to put on it
um

01:34:09.110 --> 01:34:09.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:34:12.070 --> 01:34:12.080 align:start position:0%
so it's uh it's a big problem for the
 
01:34:12.080 --> 01:34:14.629 align:start position:0%
so it's uh it's a big problem for the
landowners

01:34:14.629 --> 01:34:14.639 align:start position:0%
landowners
 
01:34:14.639 --> 01:34:16.070 align:start position:0%
landowners
so

01:34:16.070 --> 01:34:16.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:34:20.310 --> 01:34:20.320 align:start position:0%
this bill it targeted only as as the
 
01:34:22.709 --> 01:34:22.719 align:start position:0%
commission was charged with doing it
 
01:34:26.470 --> 01:34:26.480 align:start position:0%
charges only the older systems those
 
01:34:28.629 --> 01:34:28.639 align:start position:0%
have never had a permit
 
01:34:31.430 --> 01:34:31.440 align:start position:0%
or the ones that are 20 years old which
 
01:34:34.229 --> 01:34:34.239 align:start position:0%
means that they could be expected to
 
01:34:34.239 --> 01:34:36.310 align:start position:0%
means that they could be expected to
have

01:34:36.310 --> 01:34:36.320 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:34:38.790 --> 01:34:38.800 align:start position:0%
to be performing in a way that might not
 
01:34:42.870 --> 01:34:42.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:45.750 --> 01:34:45.760 align:start position:0%
the assessments for both the site and
 
01:34:47.830 --> 01:34:47.840 align:start position:0%
the evaluation of the septic system
 
01:34:51.110 --> 01:34:51.120 align:start position:0%
itself are provided to the buyer
 
01:34:55.189 --> 01:34:55.199 align:start position:0%
as well as to des and the local health
 
01:34:55.199 --> 01:34:57.510 align:start position:0%
as well as to des and the local health
official

01:34:57.510 --> 01:34:57.520 align:start position:0%
official
 
01:34:57.520 --> 01:34:59.590 align:start position:0%
official
now

01:34:59.590 --> 01:34:59.600 align:start position:0%
now
 
01:35:02.149 --> 01:35:02.159 align:start position:0%
it's true that the cost of evaluating a
 
01:35:02.159 --> 01:35:03.350 align:start position:0%
it's true that the cost of evaluating a
system

01:35:03.350 --> 01:35:03.360 align:start position:0%
system
 
01:35:05.350 --> 01:35:05.360 align:start position:0%
will add somewhat to the cost of the
 
01:35:07.830 --> 01:35:07.840 align:start position:0%
property which as we know the cost of
 
01:35:10.470 --> 01:35:10.480 align:start position:0%
properties is now very high and doesn't
 
01:35:13.189 --> 01:35:13.199 align:start position:0%
seem to be deterring people
 
01:35:15.030 --> 01:35:15.040 align:start position:0%
from buying them
 
01:35:18.070 --> 01:35:18.080 align:start position:0%
but this expense is minor compared to
 
01:35:21.910 --> 01:35:21.920 align:start position:0%
the cost for an uninformed buyer to
 
01:35:21.920 --> 01:35:22.709 align:start position:0%
the cost for an uninformed buyer to
uh

01:35:22.709 --> 01:35:22.719 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:35:23.990 --> 01:35:24.000 align:start position:0%
to buy a
 
01:35:25.990 --> 01:35:26.000 align:start position:0%
property that has a septic system that
 
01:35:28.950 --> 01:35:28.960 align:start position:0%
he then finds has to be completely
 
01:35:28.960 --> 01:35:31.030 align:start position:0%
he then finds has to be completely
redone

01:35:31.030 --> 01:35:31.040 align:start position:0%
redone
 
01:35:34.950 --> 01:35:34.960 align:start position:0%
and when you look at the bigger issue
 
01:35:37.270 --> 01:35:37.280 align:start position:0%
what what we're really getting at which
 
01:35:37.280 --> 01:35:38.390 align:start position:0%
what what we're really getting at which
is

01:35:38.390 --> 01:35:38.400 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:35:40.709 --> 01:35:40.719 align:start position:0%
saving our surface waters from being
 
01:35:40.719 --> 01:35:42.390 align:start position:0%
saving our surface waters from being
contaminated

01:35:42.390 --> 01:35:42.400 align:start position:0%
contaminated
 
01:35:45.229 --> 01:35:45.239 align:start position:0%
saving our groundwater from being
 
01:35:47.189 --> 01:35:47.199 align:start position:0%
contaminated by
 
01:35:49.590 --> 01:35:49.600 align:start position:0%
underperforming septic systems
 
01:35:52.310 --> 01:35:52.320 align:start position:0%
the amount that it that is spent
 
01:35:53.830 --> 01:35:53.840 align:start position:0%
by the buyer
 
01:35:56.629 --> 01:35:56.639 align:start position:0%
in a an individual transaction
 
01:35:59.430 --> 01:35:59.440 align:start position:0%
is minuscule compared to the public
 
01:36:02.550 --> 01:36:02.560 align:start position:0%
benefit and the cost of
 
01:36:06.070 --> 01:36:06.080 align:start position:0%
remediating a series of underperforming
 
01:36:08.709 --> 01:36:08.719 align:start position:0%
septic systems so the commission felt
 
01:36:11.189 --> 01:36:11.199 align:start position:0%
that this was a reasonable way to
 
01:36:12.950 --> 01:36:12.960 align:start position:0%
approach this problem
 
01:36:16.070 --> 01:36:16.080 align:start position:0%
it also although it will also give us
 
01:36:18.470 --> 01:36:18.480 align:start position:0%
some data on how many of the septic
 
01:36:21.910 --> 01:36:21.920 align:start position:0%
systems are actually performing well
 
01:36:26.310 --> 01:36:26.320 align:start position:0%
so for once the the des will have some
 
01:36:28.310 --> 01:36:28.320 align:start position:0%
inventory at some
 
01:36:29.830 --> 01:36:29.840 align:start position:0%
at some level
 
01:36:32.149 --> 01:36:32.159 align:start position:0%
of the septic systems that are good and
 
01:36:34.149 --> 01:36:34.159 align:start position:0%
the ones that are
 
01:36:37.350 --> 01:36:37.360 align:start position:0%
in need of of being addressed
 
01:36:40.229 --> 01:36:40.239 align:start position:0%
it does not require that the buyer do
 
01:36:42.149 --> 01:36:42.159 align:start position:0%
anything with this septic system it
 
01:36:42.159 --> 01:36:43.270 align:start position:0%
anything with this septic system it
merely

01:36:43.270 --> 01:36:43.280 align:start position:0%
merely
 
01:36:46.149 --> 01:36:46.159 align:start position:0%
um informs them
 
01:36:47.109 --> 01:36:47.119 align:start position:0%
now that
 
01:36:47.119 --> 01:36:48.149 align:start position:0%
now that
the

01:36:48.149 --> 01:36:48.159 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:36:49.669 --> 01:36:49.679 align:start position:0%
the first section that talks about
 
01:36:52.470 --> 01:36:52.480 align:start position:0%
develop waterfront property
 
01:36:52.480 --> 01:36:53.830 align:start position:0%
develop waterfront property
is

01:36:53.830 --> 01:36:53.840 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:36:58.070 --> 01:36:58.080 align:start position:0%
is to bring that the uh that 250 feet
 
01:37:00.629 --> 01:37:00.639 align:start position:0%
buffer into alignment with the buffer
 
01:37:03.030 --> 01:37:03.040 align:start position:0%
for the shoreland uh water quality
 
01:37:05.109 --> 01:37:05.119 align:start position:0%
protection act and that needed to be
 
01:37:07.030 --> 01:37:07.040 align:start position:0%
done because there was some confusion
 
01:37:08.709 --> 01:37:08.719 align:start position:0%
about that
 
01:37:11.109 --> 01:37:11.119 align:start position:0%
um i would be happy to answer any
 
01:37:11.119 --> 01:37:14.550 align:start position:0%
um i would be happy to answer any
questions

01:37:14.550 --> 01:37:14.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:15.910 --> 01:37:15.920 align:start position:0%
are there any questions for
 
01:37:17.590 --> 01:37:17.600 align:start position:0%
representative spain representative
 
01:37:19.590 --> 01:37:19.600 align:start position:0%
gunski we have a question thank you mr
 
01:37:19.600 --> 01:37:20.709 align:start position:0%
gunski we have a question thank you mr
chair

01:37:20.709 --> 01:37:20.719 align:start position:0%
chair
 
01:37:23.750 --> 01:37:23.760 align:start position:0%
good morning representative good morning
 
01:37:25.590 --> 01:37:25.600 align:start position:0%
i was curious
 
01:37:27.189 --> 01:37:27.199 align:start position:0%
this does seem to have some kind of
 
01:37:29.510 --> 01:37:29.520 align:start position:0%
financial impact but there's no fiscal
 
01:37:31.270 --> 01:37:31.280 align:start position:0%
note with the bill
 
01:37:34.310 --> 01:37:34.320 align:start position:0%
was that considered and if so what's
 
01:37:35.830 --> 01:37:35.840 align:start position:0%
your thoughts on that
 
01:37:38.149 --> 01:37:38.159 align:start position:0%
well of course uh the financial impact
 
01:37:40.470 --> 01:37:40.480 align:start position:0%
if we were going to get a uh
 
01:37:41.910 --> 01:37:41.920 align:start position:0%
an in
 
01:37:44.950 --> 01:37:44.960 align:start position:0%
a fiscal note that only implies or it
 
01:37:47.669 --> 01:37:47.679 align:start position:0%
only measures the fiscal impact for the
 
01:37:49.990 --> 01:37:50.000 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire
 
01:37:53.030 --> 01:37:53.040 align:start position:0%
and you can ask the same question of des
 
01:37:54.629 --> 01:37:54.639 align:start position:0%
whether this will
 
01:37:57.109 --> 01:37:57.119 align:start position:0%
increase cost to them
 
01:38:00.229 --> 01:38:00.239 align:start position:0%
as i've said it will increase the cost
 
01:38:02.629 --> 01:38:02.639 align:start position:0%
this cost of having the evaluation will
 
01:38:04.390 --> 01:38:04.400 align:start position:0%
be tacked on to
 
01:38:06.790 --> 01:38:06.800 align:start position:0%
the cost of the transaction
 
01:38:09.510 --> 01:38:09.520 align:start position:0%
now whether the buyer pays that or the
 
01:38:13.030 --> 01:38:13.040 align:start position:0%
seller pays that or they divide it it is
 
01:38:16.149 --> 01:38:16.159 align:start position:0%
up to them
 
01:38:16.159 --> 01:38:17.270 align:start position:0%
up to them
okay

01:38:17.270 --> 01:38:17.280 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:38:20.149 --> 01:38:20.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:22.470 --> 01:38:22.480 align:start position:0%
representative for question
 
01:38:25.189 --> 01:38:25.199 align:start position:0%
yes thank you for taking my question
 
01:38:28.149 --> 01:38:28.159 align:start position:0%
it has to do with um section one the
 
01:38:31.350 --> 01:38:31.360 align:start position:0%
definition of develop waterfront
 
01:38:35.109 --> 01:38:35.119 align:start position:0%
i wondered one why did they add 50 more
 
01:38:37.750 --> 01:38:37.760 align:start position:0%
feet from 200 to 250
 
01:38:39.830 --> 01:38:39.840 align:start position:0%
but my second part is
 
01:38:42.149 --> 01:38:42.159 align:start position:0%
i tried to read the statute and the
 
01:38:45.669 --> 01:38:45.679 align:start position:0%
reference line when i went to rsa
 
01:38:48.470 --> 01:38:48.480 align:start position:0%
483 b4
 
01:38:50.629 --> 01:38:50.639 align:start position:0%
sub roman numerals
 
01:38:53.910 --> 01:38:53.920 align:start position:0%
it gave me when i looked at the chart
 
01:38:57.270 --> 01:38:57.280 align:start position:0%
elevations of the water of the pond
 
01:38:59.750 --> 01:38:59.760 align:start position:0%
i can't figure out how do you calculate
 
01:39:02.629 --> 01:39:02.639 align:start position:0%
whether it's the 200 or 250 from an
 
01:39:05.590 --> 01:39:05.600 align:start position:0%
elevation in the pond are you able to
 
01:39:08.070 --> 01:39:08.080 align:start position:0%
answer that question representative yeah
 
01:39:10.070 --> 01:39:10.080 align:start position:0%
yeah i've been wrestling with this too
 
01:39:12.709 --> 01:39:12.719 align:start position:0%
because we have um when we wrote the
 
01:39:15.830 --> 01:39:15.840 align:start position:0%
shoreland protection act and when we're
 
01:39:19.590 --> 01:39:19.600 align:start position:0%
looking at um the definition of a stream
 
01:39:21.350 --> 01:39:21.360 align:start position:0%
with rivers and things
 
01:39:22.870 --> 01:39:22.880 align:start position:0%
it's uh
 
01:39:25.510 --> 01:39:25.520 align:start position:0%
it's called the reference line and it is
 
01:39:28.470 --> 01:39:28.480 align:start position:0%
defined differently for salt water and
 
01:39:31.189 --> 01:39:31.199 align:start position:0%
fresh water and for fresh water that is
 
01:39:33.030 --> 01:39:33.040 align:start position:0%
impounded by a dam
 
01:39:35.030 --> 01:39:35.040 align:start position:0%
so with salt water it's the highest
 
01:39:36.950 --> 01:39:36.960 align:start position:0%
observable tide
 
01:39:39.510 --> 01:39:39.520 align:start position:0%
for fresh water it's pretty much the
 
01:39:39.520 --> 01:39:41.189 align:start position:0%
for fresh water it's pretty much the
same

01:39:41.189 --> 01:39:41.199 align:start position:0%
same
 
01:39:43.830 --> 01:39:43.840 align:start position:0%
and for uh fresh water that's damned of
 
01:39:46.390 --> 01:39:46.400 align:start position:0%
course it's the height of the dam so
 
01:39:48.550 --> 01:39:48.560 align:start position:0%
that determines where that reference
 
01:39:51.430 --> 01:39:51.440 align:start position:0%
line is which determines which is
 
01:39:53.510 --> 01:39:53.520 align:start position:0%
basically saying this is the high water
 
01:39:56.790 --> 01:39:56.800 align:start position:0%
level this is where the you know the
 
01:39:59.510 --> 01:39:59.520 align:start position:0%
i don't have to explain this to you
 
01:40:00.950 --> 01:40:00.960 align:start position:0%
um but
 
01:40:04.950 --> 01:40:04.960 align:start position:0%
so then it's measured back from there
 
01:40:08.870 --> 01:40:08.880 align:start position:0%
what happens within that 250 feet
 
01:40:12.310 --> 01:40:12.320 align:start position:0%
is defined in further regulations like
 
01:40:14.709 --> 01:40:14.719 align:start position:0%
in the shoreline protection act they
 
01:40:14.719 --> 01:40:15.590 align:start position:0%
in the shoreline protection act they
have

01:40:15.590 --> 01:40:15.600 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:40:18.310 --> 01:40:18.320 align:start position:0%
one one thing that can and cannot happen
 
01:40:21.750 --> 01:40:21.760 align:start position:0%
within that that 250 feet
 
01:40:21.760 --> 01:40:22.390 align:start position:0%
within that that 250 feet
the

01:40:22.390 --> 01:40:22.400 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:40:22.400 --> 01:40:23.910 align:start position:0%
the
um

01:40:23.910 --> 01:40:23.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:40:25.669 --> 01:40:25.679 align:start position:0%
there were studies that were done
 
01:40:25.679 --> 01:40:26.870 align:start position:0%
there were studies that were done
particularly

01:40:26.870 --> 01:40:26.880 align:start position:0%
particularly
 
01:40:29.189 --> 01:40:29.199 align:start position:0%
an exhaustive study that was done around
 
01:40:31.189 --> 01:40:31.199 align:start position:0%
great bay because as you know there are
 
01:40:34.790 --> 01:40:34.800 align:start position:0%
very serious uh pollution problems there
 
01:40:37.990 --> 01:40:38.000 align:start position:0%
that showed that 250 feet setback is
 
01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:39.350 align:start position:0%
that showed that 250 feet setback is
required

01:40:39.350 --> 01:40:39.360 align:start position:0%
required
 
01:40:42.070 --> 01:40:42.080 align:start position:0%
to protect the the bay and its
 
01:40:45.350 --> 01:40:45.360 align:start position:0%
tributaries from contamination by septic
 
01:40:45.360 --> 01:40:46.550 align:start position:0%
tributaries from contamination by septic
systems

01:40:46.550 --> 01:40:46.560 align:start position:0%
systems
 
01:40:48.709 --> 01:40:48.719 align:start position:0%
so this seemed to be a good place to
 
01:40:48.719 --> 01:40:50.629 align:start position:0%
so this seemed to be a good place to
start

01:40:50.629 --> 01:40:50.639 align:start position:0%
start
 
01:40:54.149 --> 01:40:54.159 align:start position:0%
it doesn't necessarily and
 
01:40:57.109 --> 01:40:57.119 align:start position:0%
it doesn't necessarily
 
01:41:00.070 --> 01:41:00.080 align:start position:0%
imply that particular regulations are
 
01:41:03.350 --> 01:41:03.360 align:start position:0%
applying to those it just sets the zone
 
01:41:06.149 --> 01:41:06.159 align:start position:0%
and then what happens within that zone
 
01:41:09.830 --> 01:41:09.840 align:start position:0%
is determined in other statutes like the
 
01:41:09.840 --> 01:41:12.470 align:start position:0%
is determined in other statutes like the
shoreland

01:41:12.470 --> 01:41:12.480 align:start position:0%
shoreland
 
01:41:12.480 --> 01:41:13.990 align:start position:0%
shoreland
okay

01:41:13.990 --> 01:41:14.000 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:41:16.629 --> 01:41:16.639 align:start position:0%
that answer your question representative
 
01:41:18.390 --> 01:41:18.400 align:start position:0%
yes i think the representative by
 
01:41:20.470 --> 01:41:20.480 align:start position:0%
telling me that it's from the high
 
01:41:22.950 --> 01:41:22.960 align:start position:0%
watermark or the shoreline i tried to
 
01:41:27.270 --> 01:41:27.280 align:start position:0%
calculate how how do i cover the 250
 
01:41:29.430 --> 01:41:29.440 align:start position:0%
and i appreciate that you're tying this
 
01:41:31.910 --> 01:41:31.920 align:start position:0%
into the shoreline protection act
 
01:41:35.030 --> 01:41:35.040 align:start position:0%
distance thank you thanks
 
01:41:37.109 --> 01:41:37.119 align:start position:0%
any additional questions
 
01:41:39.350 --> 01:41:39.360 align:start position:0%
i see no additional questions
 
01:41:42.149 --> 01:41:42.159 align:start position:0%
uh the chair has a question uh
 
01:41:45.990 --> 01:41:46.000 align:start position:0%
the bill as i as i read it says that
 
01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:47.910 align:start position:0%
the bill as i as i read it says that
the

01:41:47.910 --> 01:41:47.920 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:41:50.070 --> 01:41:50.080 align:start position:0%
the septa systems
 
01:41:53.109 --> 01:41:53.119 align:start position:0%
uh really basically says
 
01:41:56.149 --> 01:41:56.159 align:start position:0%
concern that they're not built
 
01:41:57.629 --> 01:41:57.639 align:start position:0%
to today's
 
01:42:01.189 --> 01:42:01.199 align:start position:0%
standards and uh
 
01:42:04.950 --> 01:42:04.960 align:start position:0%
it doesn't say that they don't work
 
01:42:08.070 --> 01:42:08.080 align:start position:0%
well this is why um
 
01:42:10.310 --> 01:42:10.320 align:start position:0%
this is where it gets interesting if
 
01:42:13.109 --> 01:42:13.119 align:start position:0%
you've been studying it for two years
 
01:42:13.119 --> 01:42:14.790 align:start position:0%
you've been studying it for two years
um

01:42:14.790 --> 01:42:14.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:42:17.270 --> 01:42:17.280 align:start position:0%
you'll notice that it doesn't assume
 
01:42:19.109 --> 01:42:19.119 align:start position:0%
that they don't work
 
01:42:21.750 --> 01:42:21.760 align:start position:0%
it's just saying we had to
 
01:42:21.760 --> 01:42:22.950 align:start position:0%
it's just saying we had to
decide

01:42:22.950 --> 01:42:22.960 align:start position:0%
decide
 
01:42:22.960 --> 01:42:24.470 align:start position:0%
decide
which

01:42:24.470 --> 01:42:24.480 align:start position:0%
which
 
01:42:26.629 --> 01:42:26.639 align:start position:0%
systems were
 
01:42:30.550 --> 01:42:30.560 align:start position:0%
unlike we're likely to be um beginning
 
01:42:33.430 --> 01:42:33.440 align:start position:0%
to to fail and therefore should be
 
01:42:35.830 --> 01:42:35.840 align:start position:0%
subject to having
 
01:42:39.590 --> 01:42:39.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:43.590 --> 01:42:43.600 align:start position:0%
and the uh you'll if the evaluation
 
01:42:45.669 --> 01:42:45.679 align:start position:0%
looks good then that's the end of the
 
01:42:45.679 --> 01:42:47.510 align:start position:0%
looks good then that's the end of the
story

01:42:47.510 --> 01:42:47.520 align:start position:0%
story
 
01:42:49.910 --> 01:42:49.920 align:start position:0%
but it just says that
 
01:42:51.590 --> 01:42:51.600 align:start position:0%
this is saying
 
01:42:53.990 --> 01:42:54.000 align:start position:0%
we're going to look at these systems
 
01:42:56.550 --> 01:42:56.560 align:start position:0%
because they are the ones that are most
 
01:42:59.189 --> 01:42:59.199 align:start position:0%
likely to have a problem the
 
01:43:02.629 --> 01:43:02.639 align:start position:0%
understanding is that many of them won't
 
01:43:05.750 --> 01:43:05.760 align:start position:0%
um but right now we've got systems on
 
01:43:08.629 --> 01:43:08.639 align:start position:0%
houses that have been built for 75 years
 
01:43:10.790 --> 01:43:10.800 align:start position:0%
that are still operating on a
 
01:43:13.030 --> 01:43:13.040 align:start position:0%
55 gallon drum
 
01:43:15.990 --> 01:43:16.000 align:start position:0%
and we have no way of
 
01:43:18.800 --> 01:43:18.810 align:start position:0%
of addressing that of getting them
 
01:43:18.810 --> 01:43:20.550 align:start position:0%
of addressing that of getting them
[Music]

01:43:20.550 --> 01:43:20.560 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:43:23.510 --> 01:43:23.520 align:start position:0%
getting them examined
 
01:43:26.870 --> 01:43:26.880 align:start position:0%
the we also have instances where a house
 
01:43:26.880 --> 01:43:27.910 align:start position:0%
the we also have instances where a house
that

01:43:27.910 --> 01:43:27.920 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:43:31.030 --> 01:43:31.040 align:start position:0%
uh now has a washing machine and uh etc
 
01:43:33.109 --> 01:43:33.119 align:start position:0%
etc and people are living there full
 
01:43:35.189 --> 01:43:35.199 align:start position:0%
time that weren't before and their
 
01:43:36.870 --> 01:43:36.880 align:start position:0%
system was built
 
01:43:38.470 --> 01:43:38.480 align:start position:0%
uh to accommodate
 
01:43:40.390 --> 01:43:40.400 align:start position:0%
one bedroom
 
01:43:42.550 --> 01:43:42.560 align:start position:0%
so that
 
01:43:44.950 --> 01:43:44.960 align:start position:0%
it is not a way of saying that we're
 
01:43:47.590 --> 01:43:47.600 align:start position:0%
presuming that they're bad it's a way of
 
01:43:47.600 --> 01:43:48.950 align:start position:0%
presuming that they're bad it's a way of
saying

01:43:48.950 --> 01:43:48.960 align:start position:0%
saying
 
01:43:51.430 --> 01:43:51.440 align:start position:0%
these are the ones that we should if
 
01:43:53.510 --> 01:43:53.520 align:start position:0%
we're going to limit them but ones that
 
01:43:56.550 --> 01:43:56.560 align:start position:0%
we ex that we look at then these are the
 
01:43:59.189 --> 01:43:59.199 align:start position:0%
ones that are most likely to have a
 
01:44:03.590 --> 01:44:03.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:06.550 --> 01:44:06.560 align:start position:0%
uh i'll go on to a different question
 
01:44:06.560 --> 01:44:08.149 align:start position:0%
uh i'll go on to a different question
uh

01:44:08.149 --> 01:44:08.159 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:44:09.830 --> 01:44:09.840 align:start position:0%
who is
 
01:44:12.310 --> 01:44:12.320 align:start position:0%
who is there is there appears to be a
 
01:44:15.189 --> 01:44:15.199 align:start position:0%
a policing function here is there not
 
01:44:17.830 --> 01:44:17.840 align:start position:0%
and who who does that policing function
 
01:44:20.470 --> 01:44:20.480 align:start position:0%
what if someone doesn't
 
01:44:23.030 --> 01:44:23.040 align:start position:0%
doesn't bother to do this
 
01:44:25.270 --> 01:44:25.280 align:start position:0%
what is the
 
01:44:28.070 --> 01:44:28.080 align:start position:0%
what is the penalty and who does it
 
01:44:30.229 --> 01:44:30.239 align:start position:0%
well there's this it falls underneath
 
01:44:33.830 --> 01:44:33.840 align:start position:0%
the um the existing statute which is
 
01:44:37.750 --> 01:44:37.760 align:start position:0%
waterfront property sale the rsa 485 a
 
01:44:41.350 --> 01:44:41.360 align:start position:0%
39 which already requires that a site
 
01:44:44.470 --> 01:44:44.480 align:start position:0%
assessment study be done
 
01:44:47.270 --> 01:44:47.280 align:start position:0%
and with a not only the assessment of
 
01:44:50.629 --> 01:44:50.639 align:start position:0%
the site but also identifying the
 
01:44:52.629 --> 01:44:52.639 align:start position:0%
name and address of the seller and the
 
01:44:55.030 --> 01:44:55.040 align:start position:0%
seller's agent and the
 
01:44:57.109 --> 01:44:57.119 align:start position:0%
identifying the lot
 
01:44:57.119 --> 01:44:58.229 align:start position:0%
identifying the lot
um

01:44:58.229 --> 01:44:58.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:45:01.109 --> 01:45:01.119 align:start position:0%
and then so that it would come under the
 
01:45:03.910 --> 01:45:03.920 align:start position:0%
same that that same statute that they
 
01:45:05.750 --> 01:45:05.760 align:start position:0%
would be
 
01:45:09.270 --> 01:45:09.280 align:start position:0%
enforced together now as i said if the
 
01:45:13.189 --> 01:45:13.199 align:start position:0%
system is found to be substandard
 
01:45:16.629 --> 01:45:16.639 align:start position:0%
no one is going to force the uh
 
01:45:19.350 --> 01:45:19.360 align:start position:0%
the buyer to do anything about it
 
01:45:22.470 --> 01:45:22.480 align:start position:0%
but we at least will know that that that
 
01:45:24.390 --> 01:45:24.400 align:start position:0%
the system is a problem
 
01:45:27.350 --> 01:45:27.360 align:start position:0%
des would probably be best at telling
 
01:45:27.360 --> 01:45:28.070 align:start position:0%
des would probably be best at telling
you

01:45:28.070 --> 01:45:28.080 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:45:30.550 --> 01:45:30.560 align:start position:0%
about the enforcement and how they will
 
01:45:32.310 --> 01:45:32.320 align:start position:0%
interpret the findings of these
 
01:45:32.320 --> 01:45:36.229 align:start position:0%
interpret the findings of these
evaluations

01:45:36.229 --> 01:45:36.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:37.510 --> 01:45:37.520 align:start position:0%
uh also
 
01:45:39.910 --> 01:45:39.920 align:start position:0%
the additional question concerning
 
01:45:44.070 --> 01:45:44.080 align:start position:0%
the the sale of property if someone uh
 
01:45:45.030 --> 01:45:45.040 align:start position:0%
can the
 
01:45:45.040 --> 01:45:46.229 align:start position:0%
can the
buyer

01:45:46.229 --> 01:45:46.239 align:start position:0%
buyer
 
01:45:49.669 --> 01:45:49.679 align:start position:0%
waive the rights uh for this
 
01:45:51.109 --> 01:45:51.119 align:start position:0%
uh for the
 
01:45:53.669 --> 01:45:53.679 align:start position:0%
for this study basically by
 
01:45:56.709 --> 01:45:56.719 align:start position:0%
agreeing to it as is purchased
 
01:45:56.719 --> 01:45:59.189 align:start position:0%
agreeing to it as is purchased
and

01:45:59.189 --> 01:45:59.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:01.430 --> 01:46:01.440 align:start position:0%
so basically the seller
 
01:46:03.669 --> 01:46:03.679 align:start position:0%
can say you're buying the product the
 
01:46:06.550 --> 01:46:06.560 align:start position:0%
product the property as is
 
01:46:10.629 --> 01:46:10.639 align:start position:0%
and would that negate the use of this
 
01:46:10.639 --> 01:46:13.270 align:start position:0%
and would that negate the use of this
function

01:46:13.270 --> 01:46:13.280 align:start position:0%
function
 
01:46:15.430 --> 01:46:15.440 align:start position:0%
that um
 
01:46:17.189 --> 01:46:17.199 align:start position:0%
that makes sense if we're just
 
01:46:20.390 --> 01:46:20.400 align:start position:0%
considering the impact on the buyer but
 
01:46:22.870 --> 01:46:22.880 align:start position:0%
we're also considering whether or not
 
01:46:24.709 --> 01:46:24.719 align:start position:0%
the state is going to be able to
 
01:46:26.709 --> 01:46:26.719 align:start position:0%
identify where
 
01:46:28.390 --> 01:46:28.400 align:start position:0%
potentially polluting
 
01:46:30.709 --> 01:46:30.719 align:start position:0%
septic systems are and that's where we
 
01:46:33.910 --> 01:46:33.920 align:start position:0%
do need to have the report sent to des
 
01:46:35.350 --> 01:46:35.360 align:start position:0%
and the
 
01:46:37.109 --> 01:46:37.119 align:start position:0%

uh senator he was the next person i'm
 
01:46:56.310 --> 01:46:56.320 align:start position:0%
going to call as a member as a
 
01:47:04.470 --> 01:47:04.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:06.629 --> 01:47:06.639 align:start position:0%
how's he making up
 
01:47:06.639 --> 01:47:07.669 align:start position:0%
how's he making up
he's

01:47:07.669 --> 01:47:07.679 align:start position:0%

coming up
okay

01:47:11.030 --> 01:47:11.040 align:start position:0%

yeah he is uh he is there
 
01:47:15.510 --> 01:47:15.520 align:start position:0%
all right do you have me now
 
01:47:17.510 --> 01:47:17.520 align:start position:0%
uh we got you all right well thank you
 
01:47:19.030 --> 01:47:19.040 align:start position:0%
and uh good morning mr chairman members
 
01:47:21.189 --> 01:47:21.199 align:start position:0%
of the committee uh i'm senator david

waters district 4 which is barrington
 
01:47:23.920 --> 01:47:24.870 align:start position:0%
waters district 4 which is barrington
over

01:47:24.870 --> 01:47:24.880 align:start position:0%
over
 
01:47:26.870 --> 01:47:26.880 align:start position:0%
roundsford and somersworth and i'm here
 
01:47:29.030 --> 01:47:29.040 align:start position:0%
as a co-sponsor to testify in support of
 
01:47:30.109 --> 01:47:30.119 align:start position:0%
house bill
 
01:47:30.119 --> 01:47:31.750 align:start position:0%
house bill
426.

01:47:31.750 --> 01:47:31.760 align:start position:0%
426.
 
01:47:33.270 --> 01:47:33.280 align:start position:0%
i want to offer to the committee the
 
01:47:35.270 --> 01:47:35.280 align:start position:0%
perspective of all the communities
 
01:47:37.750 --> 01:47:37.760 align:start position:0%
around the great bay and we've been
 
01:47:39.910 --> 01:47:39.920 align:start position:0%
dealing uh you know really for decades
 
01:47:41.109 --> 01:47:41.119 align:start position:0%
now with the
 
01:47:43.030 --> 01:47:43.040 align:start position:0%
uh problem of nitrogen pollution in the
 
01:47:44.229 --> 01:47:44.239 align:start position:0%
great bay
 
01:47:47.030 --> 01:47:47.040 align:start position:0%
and in particular uh this has led to a
 
01:47:49.510 --> 01:47:49.520 align:start position:0%
long-standing contest or battle or fight
 
01:47:51.189 --> 01:47:51.199 align:start position:0%
whatever you want to call with the uh
 
01:47:52.790 --> 01:47:52.800 align:start position:0%
with the epa
 
01:47:55.350 --> 01:47:55.360 align:start position:0%
um over its uh permitting and licensing
 
01:47:57.350 --> 01:47:57.360 align:start position:0%
requirements for
 
01:48:00.070 --> 01:48:00.080 align:start position:0%
our wastewater treatment plants around
 
01:48:01.109 --> 01:48:01.119 align:start position:0%
the bay
 
01:48:03.030 --> 01:48:03.040 align:start position:0%
uh and as we know the feds regulate what
 
01:48:04.950 --> 01:48:04.960 align:start position:0%
they can wait they can regulate and
 
01:48:06.950 --> 01:48:06.960 align:start position:0%
about 40 percent of
 
01:48:08.550 --> 01:48:08.560 align:start position:0%
the nitrogen source was coming from the
 
01:48:11.830 --> 01:48:11.840 align:start position:0%
wastewater treatment plants and i would
 
01:48:13.910 --> 01:48:13.920 align:start position:0%
say that communities around the bay have
 
01:48:16.629 --> 01:48:16.639 align:start position:0%
spent north of 200 million dollars
 
01:48:18.790 --> 01:48:18.800 align:start position:0%
over the last uh 10 years upgrading
 
01:48:20.470 --> 01:48:20.480 align:start position:0%
their wastewater
 
01:48:21.830 --> 01:48:21.840 align:start position:0%
treatment plants and you know really
 
01:48:23.590 --> 01:48:23.600 align:start position:0%
stepped up we want to clean bay it's
 
01:48:25.910 --> 01:48:25.920 align:start position:0%
important for the economy in the area
 
01:48:29.030 --> 01:48:29.040 align:start position:0%
uh and for real estate sales um
 
01:48:31.030 --> 01:48:31.040 align:start position:0%
but then the epa was going to come in
 
01:48:33.669 --> 01:48:33.679 align:start position:0%
and put a standard which most folks
 
01:48:35.590 --> 01:48:35.600 align:start position:0%
thought was going to be impossible
 
01:48:36.629 --> 01:48:36.639 align:start position:0%
to meet
 
01:48:36.639 --> 01:48:37.669 align:start position:0%
to meet
for

01:48:37.669 --> 01:48:37.679 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:48:39.990 --> 01:48:40.000 align:start position:0%
you know to further reduce the nitrogen
 
01:48:42.470 --> 01:48:42.480 align:start position:0%
pollution so the negotiation which took
 
01:48:45.030 --> 01:48:45.040 align:start position:0%
several years was reached a few years
 
01:48:46.709 --> 01:48:46.719 align:start position:0%
you know a few months ago
 
01:48:49.830 --> 01:48:49.840 align:start position:0%
and the ep says a said okay look
 
01:48:52.310 --> 01:48:52.320 align:start position:0%
you can develop efforts to reduce
 
01:48:54.709 --> 01:48:54.719 align:start position:0%
nitrogen pollution from all kinds of
 
01:48:54.719 --> 01:48:55.830 align:start position:0%
nitrogen pollution from all kinds of
sources

01:48:55.830 --> 01:48:55.840 align:start position:0%
sources
 
01:48:58.070 --> 01:48:58.080 align:start position:0%
and if you can do that and it's going to
 
01:49:00.629 --> 01:49:00.639 align:start position:0%
be a savings of you know another 100
 
01:49:02.629 --> 01:49:02.639 align:start position:0%
million dollars to the communities the
 
01:49:02.639 --> 01:49:04.229 align:start position:0%
million dollars to the communities the
taxpayers

01:49:04.229 --> 01:49:04.239 align:start position:0%
taxpayers
 
01:49:06.550 --> 01:49:06.560 align:start position:0%
then you're going to be okay
 
01:49:09.030 --> 01:49:09.040 align:start position:0%
now following on top of that is the new
 
01:49:10.950 --> 01:49:10.960 align:start position:0%
regulations you know over the last
 
01:49:13.990 --> 01:49:14.000 align:start position:0%
several years over ms4 the municipal
 
01:49:14.000 --> 01:49:15.189 align:start position:0%
several years over ms4 the municipal
storm

01:49:15.189 --> 01:49:15.199 align:start position:0%
storm
 
01:49:17.270 --> 01:49:17.280 align:start position:0%
sewer system
 
01:49:19.830 --> 01:49:19.840 align:start position:0%
basically storm water runoff which is
 
01:49:22.229 --> 01:49:22.239 align:start position:0%
another source of nitrogen deposition
 
01:49:23.270 --> 01:49:23.280 align:start position:0%
into the
 
01:49:25.189 --> 01:49:25.199 align:start position:0%
into the bay and you know estimates
 
01:49:27.430 --> 01:49:27.440 align:start position:0%
raised from you know from 400 million to
 
01:49:30.149 --> 01:49:30.159 align:start position:0%
a billion dollars um unless we can find
 
01:49:31.510 --> 01:49:31.520 align:start position:0%
different ways to
 
01:49:33.910 --> 01:49:33.920 align:start position:0%
to deal with uh with with that that
 
01:49:33.920 --> 01:49:34.790 align:start position:0%
to deal with uh with with that that
issue

01:49:34.790 --> 01:49:34.800 align:start position:0%
issue
 
01:49:37.189 --> 01:49:37.199 align:start position:0%
um then the other component of course uh
 
01:49:39.189 --> 01:49:39.199 align:start position:0%
are is the other you know non-point
 
01:49:41.910 --> 01:49:41.920 align:start position:0%
sources uh or things like septic systems
 
01:49:43.189 --> 01:49:43.199 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:49:45.109 --> 01:49:45.119 align:start position:0%
so that that's what comes into play with
 
01:49:45.119 --> 01:49:46.229 align:start position:0%
so that that's what comes into play with
this

01:49:46.229 --> 01:49:46.239 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:49:47.510 --> 01:49:47.520 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
01:49:49.669 --> 01:49:49.679 align:start position:0%
uh the impacts of the nitrogen in
 
01:49:51.669 --> 01:49:51.679 align:start position:0%
general on the bay uh you know it the
 
01:49:53.430 --> 01:49:53.440 align:start position:0%
eelgrass dies and that's kind of a
 
01:49:55.189 --> 01:49:55.199 align:start position:0%
barometer of the health of the water
 
01:49:55.199 --> 01:49:56.709 align:start position:0%
barometer of the health of the water
there

01:49:56.709 --> 01:49:56.719 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:50:00.390 --> 01:50:00.400 align:start position:0%
but this impacts all kinds of
 
01:50:02.629 --> 01:50:02.639 align:start position:0%
resources in the bay
 
01:50:04.709 --> 01:50:04.719 align:start position:0%
we have a booming aquaculture
 
01:50:07.669 --> 01:50:07.679 align:start position:0%
business about 44 growers of oysters
 
01:50:08.950 --> 01:50:08.960 align:start position:0%
right now
 
01:50:10.709 --> 01:50:10.719 align:start position:0%
if you like to go fish on the coast of
 
01:50:12.550 --> 01:50:12.560 align:start position:0%
new hampshire or elsewhere
 
01:50:14.870 --> 01:50:14.880 align:start position:0%
great bay is one of the largest spawning
 
01:50:16.470 --> 01:50:16.480 align:start position:0%
grounds for fish
 
01:50:19.350 --> 01:50:19.360 align:start position:0%
on the whole east coast um
 
01:50:21.270 --> 01:50:21.280 align:start position:0%
and so the economy you know the
 
01:50:23.510 --> 01:50:23.520 align:start position:0%
recreational fishing economy the uh
 
01:50:25.270 --> 01:50:25.280 align:start position:0%
aquaculture economy these these are big
 
01:50:25.280 --> 01:50:26.390 align:start position:0%
aquaculture economy these these are big
deals

01:50:26.390 --> 01:50:26.400 align:start position:0%
deals
 
01:50:29.189 --> 01:50:29.199 align:start position:0%
but you know one incident of uh bad
 
01:50:32.149 --> 01:50:32.159 align:start position:0%
runoff out of the wastewater plants or
 
01:50:33.990 --> 01:50:34.000 align:start position:0%
uh a faulty
 
01:50:35.590 --> 01:50:35.600 align:start position:0%
septic system and you're gonna put
 
01:50:37.910 --> 01:50:37.920 align:start position:0%
somebody out out of business if their
 
01:50:40.149 --> 01:50:40.159 align:start position:0%
aquaculture operation is near
 
01:50:40.159 --> 01:50:41.270 align:start position:0%
aquaculture operation is near
there

01:50:41.270 --> 01:50:41.280 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:50:42.870 --> 01:50:42.880 align:start position:0%
so what the communities
 
01:50:44.709 --> 01:50:44.719 align:start position:0%
are now able to do under this new
 
01:50:46.629 --> 01:50:46.639 align:start position:0%
agreement with the epa is to look at all
 
01:50:48.709 --> 01:50:48.719 align:start position:0%
these sources and to develop the lowest
 
01:50:49.990 --> 01:50:50.000 align:start position:0%
cost ways
 
01:50:52.229 --> 01:50:52.239 align:start position:0%
of addressing them and uh you know as a
 
01:50:54.709 --> 01:50:54.719 align:start position:0%
taxpayer in dover where we've seen our
 
01:50:56.550 --> 01:50:56.560 align:start position:0%
water rates go up and up and up like
 
01:50:58.870 --> 01:50:58.880 align:start position:0%
everybody else around the bay um this is
 
01:51:00.550 --> 01:51:00.560 align:start position:0%
music to our ears if there are things
 
01:51:03.270 --> 01:51:03.280 align:start position:0%
that municipalities can do to reduce
 
01:51:05.030 --> 01:51:05.040 align:start position:0%
these sources then we're going to save a
 
01:51:07.830 --> 01:51:07.840 align:start position:0%
lot of a lot of money
 
01:51:09.830 --> 01:51:09.840 align:start position:0%
um so that's why this bill is so
 
01:51:12.790 --> 01:51:12.800 align:start position:0%
important uh it it lets us uh in the
 
01:51:14.950 --> 01:51:14.960 align:start position:0%
municipalities um go out work with
 
01:51:16.550 --> 01:51:16.560 align:start position:0%
property owners see where there might be
 
01:51:17.910 --> 01:51:17.920 align:start position:0%
problems if there aren't they're good
 
01:51:19.430 --> 01:51:19.440 align:start position:0%
where they're good to go
 
01:51:21.030 --> 01:51:21.040 align:start position:0%
if there are problems
 
01:51:22.629 --> 01:51:22.639 align:start position:0%
you know i think homeowners are going to
 
01:51:25.030 --> 01:51:25.040 align:start position:0%
want to step up uh you know we
 
01:51:27.510 --> 01:51:27.520 align:start position:0%
in this in new hampshire we respect our
 
01:51:28.870 --> 01:51:28.880 align:start position:0%
neighbors and we all want to keep our
 
01:51:30.709 --> 01:51:30.719 align:start position:0%
property taxes low so i think this is a
 
01:51:32.629 --> 01:51:32.639 align:start position:0%
real good practical step give something
 
01:51:35.189 --> 01:51:35.199 align:start position:0%
into the toolbox and municipalities to
 
01:51:37.109 --> 01:51:37.119 align:start position:0%
to help us out and uh for those of you
 
01:51:39.750 --> 01:51:39.760 align:start position:0%
who aren't around the great bay um you
 
01:51:41.430 --> 01:51:41.440 align:start position:0%
know this is a real this is a real big
 
01:51:43.510 --> 01:51:43.520 align:start position:0%
issue and it's also potentially going to
 
01:51:45.669 --> 01:51:45.679 align:start position:0%
affect a lot of the ms4 communities you
 
01:51:48.310 --> 01:51:48.320 align:start position:0%
know up and down the merrimack river and
 
01:51:50.229 --> 01:51:50.239 align:start position:0%
other parts on the seacoast that fall
 
01:51:52.229 --> 01:51:52.239 align:start position:0%
into this ms4
 
01:51:55.189 --> 01:51:55.199 align:start position:0%
regulation and uh municipalities they've
 
01:51:57.189 --> 01:51:57.199 align:start position:0%
got to deal with it and this is another
 
01:51:59.510 --> 01:51:59.520 align:start position:0%
way they could negotiate with the feds
 
01:52:01.350 --> 01:52:01.360 align:start position:0%
that let's look at the overall nitrogen
 
01:52:03.189 --> 01:52:03.199 align:start position:0%
where it comes from and
 
01:52:05.750 --> 01:52:05.760 align:start position:0%
not got hammered on the most expensive
 
01:52:08.310 --> 01:52:08.320 align:start position:0%
response that that might might be asked
 
01:52:08.320 --> 01:52:09.109 align:start position:0%
response that that might might be asked
for

01:52:09.109 --> 01:52:09.119 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:52:10.629 --> 01:52:10.639 align:start position:0%
so thank you mr chairman and i'll be
 
01:52:13.350 --> 01:52:13.360 align:start position:0%
glad to take any questions
 
01:52:15.589 --> 01:52:15.599 align:start position:0%
any questions for the senator
 
01:52:18.550 --> 01:52:18.560 align:start position:0%
from the members of the committee
 
01:52:20.950 --> 01:52:20.960 align:start position:0%
mr uh representative post uh
 
01:52:23.669 --> 01:52:23.679 align:start position:0%
representative post for a question
 
01:52:25.750 --> 01:52:25.760 align:start position:0%
yes uh thank you mr chairman for taking
 
01:52:28.070 --> 01:52:28.080 align:start position:0%
my question and um thank you for coming
 
01:52:31.510 --> 01:52:31.520 align:start position:0%
today senator waters my question is has
 
01:52:33.990 --> 01:52:34.000 align:start position:0%
there been um
 
01:52:36.229 --> 01:52:36.239 align:start position:0%
is there a regulation or has there been
 
01:52:37.669 --> 01:52:37.679 align:start position:0%
any work done
 
01:52:37.679 --> 01:52:38.470 align:start position:0%
any work done
with

01:52:38.470 --> 01:52:38.480 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:52:41.589 --> 01:52:41.599 align:start position:0%
nitrogen coming from
 
01:52:44.470 --> 01:52:44.480 align:start position:0%
fertilizing your lawns i know
 
01:52:47.350 --> 01:52:47.360 align:start position:0%
when we go on the lakes we see
 
01:52:49.350 --> 01:52:49.360 align:start position:0%
beautiful waterfront properties with
 
01:52:52.229 --> 01:52:52.239 align:start position:0%
great big expansive lawns that are green
 
01:52:55.540 --> 01:52:55.550 align:start position:0%
even in drought conditions so
 
01:52:55.550 --> 01:52:57.109 align:start position:0%
even in drought conditions so
[Music]

01:52:57.109 --> 01:52:57.119 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:52:59.510 --> 01:52:59.520 align:start position:0%
if you could answer that for me
 
01:53:01.510 --> 01:53:01.520 align:start position:0%
well thank you for your question and uh
 
01:53:03.350 --> 01:53:03.360 align:start position:0%
you know fertilizer
 
01:53:05.350 --> 01:53:05.360 align:start position:0%
runoff is an is an issue around the
 
01:53:06.950 --> 01:53:06.960 align:start position:0%
great bay as well and uh you know i've
 
01:53:08.550 --> 01:53:08.560 align:start position:0%
got a lot of ponds and lakes in my
 
01:53:10.790 --> 01:53:10.800 align:start position:0%
district too so i really know about this
 
01:53:10.800 --> 01:53:11.589 align:start position:0%
district too so i really know about this
and

01:53:11.589 --> 01:53:11.599 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:53:14.070 --> 01:53:14.080 align:start position:0%
there have been various attempts really
 
01:53:15.990 --> 01:53:16.000 align:start position:0%
two-fold to look at regulation
 
01:53:18.870 --> 01:53:18.880 align:start position:0%
representative um cahill has sponsored
 
01:53:18.880 --> 01:53:19.990 align:start position:0%
representative um cahill has sponsored
some

01:53:19.990 --> 01:53:20.000 align:start position:0%
some
 
01:53:21.830 --> 01:53:21.840 align:start position:0%
uh regulation on this and then prior to
 
01:53:23.030 --> 01:53:23.040 align:start position:0%
them i came from the name of the
 
01:53:24.870 --> 01:53:24.880 align:start position:0%
representative who represented newmarket
 
01:53:27.430 --> 01:53:27.440 align:start position:0%
before him um also
 
01:53:29.189 --> 01:53:29.199 align:start position:0%
looking at this issue
 
01:53:29.199 --> 01:53:30.149 align:start position:0%
looking at this issue
um

01:53:30.149 --> 01:53:30.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:53:32.550 --> 01:53:32.560 align:start position:0%
and uh it's difficult you know i think
 
01:53:33.830 --> 01:53:33.840 align:start position:0%
that there are
 
01:53:35.830 --> 01:53:35.840 align:start position:0%
you know that how far back do you say
 
01:53:38.390 --> 01:53:38.400 align:start position:0%
somebody can't use a certain product
 
01:53:40.790 --> 01:53:40.800 align:start position:0%
but the good news here is that there has
 
01:53:42.550 --> 01:53:42.560 align:start position:0%
been a lot of work also with the
 
01:53:45.430 --> 01:53:45.440 align:start position:0%
fertilizer manufacturers um scott for
 
01:53:47.830 --> 01:53:47.840 align:start position:0%
example and others have agreed to change
 
01:53:49.430 --> 01:53:49.440 align:start position:0%
their formulation
 
01:53:51.750 --> 01:53:51.760 align:start position:0%
and if you have solar release and if you
 
01:53:53.270 --> 01:53:53.280 align:start position:0%
change the formulation of you know what
 
01:53:55.910 --> 01:53:55.920 align:start position:0%
kind of phosphates and so on are in it
 
01:53:58.870 --> 01:53:58.880 align:start position:0%
you can reduce uh this problem so it's a
 
01:54:01.990 --> 01:54:02.000 align:start position:0%
big issue um you know i'm i'm always you
 
01:54:03.270 --> 01:54:03.280 align:start position:0%
know a little
 
01:54:05.510 --> 01:54:05.520 align:start position:0%
careful about telling anybody what to do
 
01:54:06.790 --> 01:54:06.800 align:start position:0%
they can do or they can't do in their
 
01:54:08.950 --> 01:54:08.960 align:start position:0%
property right you know i i think that's
 
01:54:10.310 --> 01:54:10.320 align:start position:0%
awfully important
 
01:54:12.229 --> 01:54:12.239 align:start position:0%
um but i think this is an area that we
 
01:54:14.550 --> 01:54:14.560 align:start position:0%
can work on but it's one of those places
 
01:54:15.990 --> 01:54:16.000 align:start position:0%
where if we can work with the industry
 
01:54:17.270 --> 01:54:17.280 align:start position:0%
and work with the
 
01:54:19.589 --> 01:54:19.599 align:start position:0%
with the municipalities i think that's a
 
01:54:21.830 --> 01:54:21.840 align:start position:0%
way to go on that one thank you for your
 
01:54:21.840 --> 01:54:23.510 align:start position:0%
way to go on that one thank you for your
question

01:54:23.510 --> 01:54:23.520 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:54:26.470 --> 01:54:26.480 align:start position:0%
um mr chairman may have a follow-up for
 
01:54:28.070 --> 01:54:28.080 align:start position:0%
a follow-up
 
01:54:30.550 --> 01:54:30.560 align:start position:0%
so so i guess my concern in this all um
 
01:54:32.790 --> 01:54:32.800 align:start position:0%
while i agree with you about homeowner
 
01:54:34.470 --> 01:54:34.480 align:start position:0%
rates of being able to use their
 
01:54:38.310 --> 01:54:38.320 align:start position:0%
property um i i wonder how much we
 
01:54:40.950 --> 01:54:40.960 align:start position:0%
this is only forty percent where's the
 
01:54:43.030 --> 01:54:43.040 align:start position:0%
sixty percent coming from
 
01:54:43.040 --> 01:54:44.550 align:start position:0%
sixty percent coming from
um

01:54:44.550 --> 01:54:44.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:54:47.070 --> 01:54:47.080 align:start position:0%
and and is there a greater um
 
01:54:47.080 --> 01:54:49.109 align:start position:0%
and and is there a greater um
[Music]

01:54:49.109 --> 01:54:49.119 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:54:51.830 --> 01:54:51.840 align:start position:0%
place to look than doing this that would
 
01:54:53.669 --> 01:54:53.679 align:start position:0%
have um
 
01:54:55.830 --> 01:54:55.840 align:start position:0%
a bigger impact
 
01:54:57.830 --> 01:54:57.840 align:start position:0%
well thanks for your question and um i
 
01:54:59.910 --> 01:54:59.920 align:start position:0%
don't have the statistics right in in my
 
01:55:02.310 --> 01:55:02.320 align:start position:0%
mind i know the municipal wastewater
 
01:55:04.149 --> 01:55:04.159 align:start position:0%
treatment is 40
 
01:55:07.030 --> 01:55:07.040 align:start position:0%
and then the breakout after that is um
 
01:55:09.910 --> 01:55:09.920 align:start position:0%
certainly the stormwater is a very big
 
01:55:12.470 --> 01:55:12.480 align:start position:0%
component especially in the cities where
 
01:55:14.149 --> 01:55:14.159 align:start position:0%
you've got a lot of paved
 
01:55:15.990 --> 01:55:16.000 align:start position:0%
surface doesn't make so much difference
 
01:55:17.189 --> 01:55:17.199 align:start position:0%
in a lot of the
 
01:55:18.950 --> 01:55:18.960 align:start position:0%
of the towns but then after that the
 
01:55:20.709 --> 01:55:20.719 align:start position:0%
natural there's natural deposition just
 
01:55:23.109 --> 01:55:23.119 align:start position:0%
from the atmosphere um you know we cut
 
01:55:24.709 --> 01:55:24.719 align:start position:0%
down some of that when the
 
01:55:27.430 --> 01:55:27.440 align:start position:0%
ohio power plants stopped belching it
 
01:55:30.629 --> 01:55:30.639 align:start position:0%
over to us but it's also tailpipe
 
01:55:32.950 --> 01:55:32.960 align:start position:0%
emission that just comes down with the
 
01:55:35.910 --> 01:55:35.920 align:start position:0%
with the rain and um then there the the
 
01:55:37.910 --> 01:55:37.920 align:start position:0%
advantage of looking at septic is that
 
01:55:40.149 --> 01:55:40.159 align:start position:0%
it is a really addressable point of
 
01:55:40.159 --> 01:55:41.510 align:start position:0%
it is a really addressable point of
source

01:55:41.510 --> 01:55:41.520 align:start position:0%
source
 
01:55:44.629 --> 01:55:44.639 align:start position:0%
um so that and and it can really
 
01:55:47.189 --> 01:55:47.199 align:start position:0%
have a large impact on a very small area
 
01:55:48.709 --> 01:55:48.719 align:start position:0%
we're talking about wiping out an oyster
 
01:55:49.990 --> 01:55:50.000 align:start position:0%
farm for
 
01:55:51.990 --> 01:55:52.000 align:start position:0%
for example or
 
01:55:54.229 --> 01:55:54.239 align:start position:0%
a particular kind of neighborhood that
 
01:55:56.070 --> 01:55:56.080 align:start position:0%
is has is a
 
01:55:57.990 --> 01:55:58.000 align:start position:0%
budding ashore which has
 
01:56:00.870 --> 01:56:00.880 align:start position:0%
marsh grass and eelgrass there um and
 
01:56:03.510 --> 01:56:03.520 align:start position:0%
that so i'm not exactly answering your
 
01:56:05.350 --> 01:56:05.360 align:start position:0%
question but i think that why the
 
01:56:07.270 --> 01:56:07.280 align:start position:0%
municipalities have wanted to take the
 
01:56:09.430 --> 01:56:09.440 align:start position:0%
you know all of the above approach
 
01:56:11.109 --> 01:56:11.119 align:start position:0%
is that in their own municipality they
 
01:56:13.030 --> 01:56:13.040 align:start position:0%
might identify we don't have much of a
 
01:56:14.229 --> 01:56:14.239 align:start position:0%
problem with septic we don't have much
 
01:56:14.239 --> 01:56:15.270 align:start position:0%
problem with septic we don't have much
septic

01:56:15.270 --> 01:56:15.280 align:start position:0%
septic
 
01:56:17.430 --> 01:56:17.440 align:start position:0%
um other municipalities will say well
 
01:56:18.950 --> 01:56:18.960 align:start position:0%
we've got no we really have no storm
 
01:56:21.669 --> 01:56:21.679 align:start position:0%
water system but we the septic one is is
 
01:56:23.589 --> 01:56:23.599 align:start position:0%
that so it's flexibility is what this
 
01:56:26.070 --> 01:56:26.080 align:start position:0%
bill is about
 
01:56:27.109 --> 01:56:27.119 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your
 
01:56:29.750 --> 01:56:29.760 align:start position:0%
clarification on that i appreciate it
 
01:56:31.189 --> 01:56:31.199 align:start position:0%
all right thank you
 
01:56:33.430 --> 01:56:33.440 align:start position:0%
questions see uh seeing no more
 
01:56:35.510 --> 01:56:35.520 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much senator

uh you have
 
01:56:49.830 --> 01:56:49.840 align:start position:0%
10 minutes time can you cut that
 
01:56:53.830 --> 01:56:53.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:58.390 --> 01:56:58.400 align:start position:0%

01:57:42.070 --> 01:57:42.080 align:start position:0%
we've reviewed uh house bill 426
 
01:57:45.589 --> 01:57:45.599 align:start position:0%
and have some concerns comments uh about
 
01:57:49.189 --> 01:57:49.199 align:start position:0%
the uh the bill again it's a good start
 
01:57:51.350 --> 01:57:51.360 align:start position:0%
place uh you know during the study
 
01:57:53.589 --> 01:57:53.599 align:start position:0%
committee we looked at you know where do
 
01:57:55.990 --> 01:57:56.000 align:start position:0%
we tackle first so i think looking at
 
01:57:57.189 --> 01:57:57.199 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
01:57:59.350 --> 01:57:59.360 align:start position:0%
you know the shoreline uh site
 
01:58:02.310 --> 01:58:02.320 align:start position:0%
assessments is a key one it's kind of a
 
01:58:05.669 --> 01:58:05.679 align:start position:0%
weak uh law that's in place
 
01:58:07.750 --> 01:58:07.760 align:start position:0%
the issue we have though is
 
01:58:10.950 --> 01:58:10.960 align:start position:0%
in in in the bill language
 
01:58:12.629 --> 01:58:12.639 align:start position:0%
they talk about
 
01:58:15.990 --> 01:58:16.000 align:start position:0%
having licensed septic evaluators
 
01:58:17.990 --> 01:58:18.000 align:start position:0%
do this study report
 
01:58:19.990 --> 01:58:20.000 align:start position:0%
unfortunately through the licensing
 
01:58:23.189 --> 01:58:23.199 align:start position:0%
process a licensed septic evaluator
 
01:58:25.189 --> 01:58:25.199 align:start position:0%
is not qualified
 
01:58:27.990 --> 01:58:28.000 align:start position:0%
uh with the env thousand subsurface
 
01:58:28.000 --> 01:58:29.030 align:start position:0%
uh with the env thousand subsurface
rules

01:58:29.030 --> 01:58:29.040 align:start position:0%
rules
 
01:58:29.040 --> 01:58:30.149 align:start position:0%
rules
uh

01:58:30.149 --> 01:58:30.159 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:58:33.750 --> 01:58:33.760 align:start position:0%
understanding water tables and test bits
 
01:58:36.310 --> 01:58:36.320 align:start position:0%
and and knowing uh the components of a
 
01:58:38.550 --> 01:58:38.560 align:start position:0%
leech field to that level so that's
 
01:58:40.550 --> 01:58:40.560 align:start position:0%
something where uh again we would
 
01:58:42.790 --> 01:58:42.800 align:start position:0%
probably want to have that aspect of it
 
01:58:44.790 --> 01:58:44.800 align:start position:0%
stricken from the bill
 
01:58:46.830 --> 01:58:46.840 align:start position:0%
and strictly be licensed septic
 
01:58:49.189 --> 01:58:49.199 align:start position:0%
designers i know there was discussion
 
01:58:51.669 --> 01:58:51.679 align:start position:0%
about the the fiscal impact
 
01:58:51.679 --> 01:58:52.709 align:start position:0%
about the the fiscal impact
uh

01:58:52.709 --> 01:58:52.719 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:58:54.470 --> 01:58:54.480 align:start position:0%
you know there is should it should be
 
01:58:56.790 --> 01:58:56.800 align:start position:0%
noted uh and i'm sure the realtors will
 
01:58:59.750 --> 01:58:59.760 align:start position:0%
chime in later on of what this cost
 
01:59:02.229 --> 01:59:02.239 align:start position:0%
uh will present for site assessments
 
01:59:03.270 --> 01:59:03.280 align:start position:0%
right now
 
01:59:06.550 --> 01:59:06.560 align:start position:0%
a given case i i may charge only 400 to
 
01:59:08.950 --> 01:59:08.960 align:start position:0%
do a site assessment it's it's a quick
 
01:59:08.960 --> 01:59:09.990 align:start position:0%
do a site assessment it's it's a quick
process

01:59:09.990 --> 01:59:10.000 align:start position:0%
process
 
01:59:14.070 --> 01:59:14.080 align:start position:0%
uh it is by statutory law that uh my my
 
01:59:17.270 --> 01:59:17.280 align:start position:0%
forms that i fill out both the owner
 
01:59:19.510 --> 01:59:19.520 align:start position:0%
the buyer and the seller both have to be
 
01:59:22.070 --> 01:59:22.080 align:start position:0%
signed that form but again that form
 
01:59:24.390 --> 01:59:24.400 align:start position:0%
doesn't go anywhere it doesn't go to des
 
01:59:26.149 --> 01:59:26.159 align:start position:0%
it doesn't go to the health officer so
 
01:59:29.030 --> 01:59:29.040 align:start position:0%
this is this is a good start of a bill
 
01:59:31.350 --> 01:59:31.360 align:start position:0%
that can track it at the state level but
 
01:59:33.510 --> 01:59:33.520 align:start position:0%
then there is that fiscal impact and i
 
01:59:34.629 --> 01:59:34.639 align:start position:0%
think uh
 
01:59:36.470 --> 01:59:36.480 align:start position:0%
the department will be weighing in
 
01:59:39.750 --> 01:59:39.760 align:start position:0%
shortly uh about you know how this will
 
01:59:42.229 --> 01:59:42.239 align:start position:0%
cost them you know what do they do with
 
01:59:44.229 --> 01:59:44.239 align:start position:0%
this information you know how do they
 
01:59:45.830 --> 01:59:45.840 align:start position:0%
qualize it
 
01:59:47.750 --> 01:59:47.760 align:start position:0%
and file it
 
01:59:49.830 --> 01:59:49.840 align:start position:0%
from that standpoint
 
01:59:52.149 --> 01:59:52.159 align:start position:0%
and there's no real end result with this
 
01:59:52.159 --> 01:59:53.750 align:start position:0%
and there's no real end result with this
bill

01:59:53.750 --> 01:59:53.760 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:59:55.109 --> 01:59:55.119 align:start position:0%
you know a lot of times on these
 
01:59:58.310 --> 01:59:58.320 align:start position:0%
transfer properties if there is a failed
 
02:00:00.870 --> 02:00:00.880 align:start position:0%
leech field or for substandard
 
02:00:03.910 --> 02:00:03.920 align:start position:0%
will come in as part of an escrow or
 
02:00:03.920 --> 02:00:05.350 align:start position:0%
will come in as part of an escrow or
closing

02:00:05.350 --> 02:00:05.360 align:start position:0%
closing
 
02:00:07.990 --> 02:00:08.000 align:start position:0%
to put in a feed or have that system
 
02:00:08.000 --> 02:00:09.910 align:start position:0%
to put in a feed or have that system
replaced

02:00:09.910 --> 02:00:09.920 align:start position:0%
replaced
 
02:00:11.669 --> 02:00:11.679 align:start position:0%
so there's no extra you know where it's
 
02:00:12.870 --> 02:00:12.880 align:start position:0%
going to go
 
02:00:15.830 --> 02:00:15.840 align:start position:0%
uh again so the key really uh
 
02:00:17.430 --> 02:00:17.440 align:start position:0%
for us is that we'd like to have this
 
02:00:19.990 --> 02:00:20.000 align:start position:0%
bill go to study uh and working with
 
02:00:21.589 --> 02:00:21.599 align:start position:0%
representative spang and the bill's
 
02:00:24.790 --> 02:00:24.800 align:start position:0%
sponsors and the department to really
 
02:00:26.709 --> 02:00:26.719 align:start position:0%
excuse me clean up the
 
02:00:28.629 --> 02:00:28.639 align:start position:0%
site assessment process and give it some
 
02:00:29.750 --> 02:00:29.760 align:start position:0%
more teeth
 
02:00:29.760 --> 02:00:30.790 align:start position:0%
more teeth
uh

02:00:30.790 --> 02:00:30.800 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:00:32.870 --> 02:00:32.880 align:start position:0%
again but where it goes from there it
 
02:00:35.669 --> 02:00:35.679 align:start position:0%
needs again it needs more study
 
02:00:37.430 --> 02:00:37.440 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman and the committee and
 
02:00:40.629 --> 02:00:40.639 align:start position:0%
i'll be happy to take any questions
 
02:00:42.149 --> 02:00:42.159 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your testimony
 
02:00:43.910 --> 02:00:43.920 align:start position:0%
any questions from the
 
02:00:46.149 --> 02:00:46.159 align:start position:0%
uh chair recognizes representative
 
02:00:48.310 --> 02:00:48.320 align:start position:0%
gunski thank you mr chairman
 
02:00:50.629 --> 02:00:50.639 align:start position:0%
i thank you sir for taking my question
 
02:00:52.950 --> 02:00:52.960 align:start position:0%
looking at the current statute
 
02:00:55.030 --> 02:00:55.040 align:start position:0%
in this site assessment does do you or
 
02:00:57.589 --> 02:00:57.599 align:start position:0%
your farm do you perform this this uh
 
02:01:00.070 --> 02:01:00.080 align:start position:0%
section abc assessment currently yes i
 
02:01:01.830 --> 02:01:01.840 align:start position:0%
do i do i do quite a few site
 
02:01:04.950 --> 02:01:04.960 align:start position:0%
assessments uh for closings within that
 
02:01:07.430 --> 02:01:07.440 align:start position:0%
that 200 foot that buffer so again
 
02:01:09.189 --> 02:01:09.199 align:start position:0%
having her language change from two to
 
02:01:11.990 --> 02:01:12.000 align:start position:0%
250 is is appropriate to fall in line
 
02:01:14.070 --> 02:01:14.080 align:start position:0%
with the shoreline but again it's
 
02:01:16.790 --> 02:01:16.800 align:start position:0%
you know my fees are pretty minor uh
 
02:01:19.030 --> 02:01:19.040 align:start position:0%
it's it's really i and unfortunately i
 
02:01:21.350 --> 02:01:21.360 align:start position:0%
hate to say it the department may
 
02:01:23.910 --> 02:01:23.920 align:start position:0%
be agree disagree but i i feel the
 
02:01:25.750 --> 02:01:25.760 align:start position:0%
current laws that are out there is kind
 
02:01:27.990 --> 02:01:28.000 align:start position:0%
of a lemon law it's kind of walking
 
02:01:29.990 --> 02:01:30.000 align:start position:0%
around the car that you're about to
 
02:01:31.990 --> 02:01:32.000 align:start position:0%
buy and you kick the tires
 
02:01:34.149 --> 02:01:34.159 align:start position:0%
and you know the car the tires don't
 
02:01:37.030 --> 02:01:37.040 align:start position:0%
sink so the car is okay it's really not
 
02:01:38.709 --> 02:01:38.719 align:start position:0%
doing good justice
 
02:01:41.189 --> 02:01:41.199 align:start position:0%
to the buyers and sellers on this
 
02:01:42.950 --> 02:01:42.960 align:start position:0%
transfer of these waterfront properties
 
02:01:46.390 --> 02:01:46.400 align:start position:0%
so this is a good spot uh to start in in
 
02:01:47.830 --> 02:01:47.840 align:start position:0%
trying to clean up
 
02:01:50.550 --> 02:01:50.560 align:start position:0%
uh non-point source nitrogen sources in
 
02:01:52.790 --> 02:01:52.800 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire uh again it just
 
02:01:55.350 --> 02:01:55.360 align:start position:0%
it needs some good reworking that's all
 
02:01:59.189 --> 02:01:59.199 align:start position:0%
mr general for a follow-up thank you sir
 
02:02:01.669 --> 02:02:01.679 align:start position:0%
this new section section b that we're
 
02:02:01.679 --> 02:02:02.830 align:start position:0%
this new section section b that we're
really

02:02:02.830 --> 02:02:02.840 align:start position:0%
really
 
02:02:05.189 --> 02:02:05.199 align:start position:0%
discussing would your firm you had
 
02:02:07.030 --> 02:02:07.040 align:start position:0%
mentioned a new hampshire permitted
 
02:02:09.189 --> 02:02:09.199 align:start position:0%
septic system designer
 
02:02:09.199 --> 02:02:10.229 align:start position:0%
septic system designer
uh

02:02:10.229 --> 02:02:10.239 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:02:12.790 --> 02:02:12.800 align:start position:0%
so are we now asking to have a another
 
02:02:15.109 --> 02:02:15.119 align:start position:0%
individual or another another firm
 
02:02:18.149 --> 02:02:18.159 align:start position:0%
involved other than a firm like yourself
 
02:02:20.629 --> 02:02:20.639 align:start position:0%
no they're already the way the bill is
 
02:02:23.030 --> 02:02:23.040 align:start position:0%
written it's it's it allows either a
 
02:02:25.589 --> 02:02:25.599 align:start position:0%
designer or an evaluator
 
02:02:27.830 --> 02:02:27.840 align:start position:0%
to perform this evaluation you know
 
02:02:30.390 --> 02:02:30.400 align:start position:0%
through this new bill what we're saying
 
02:02:33.109 --> 02:02:33.119 align:start position:0%
is that the evaluator should be stricken
 
02:02:34.550 --> 02:02:34.560 align:start position:0%
from the bill language that the
 
02:02:36.390 --> 02:02:36.400 align:start position:0%
evaluator through
 
02:02:38.870 --> 02:02:38.880 align:start position:0%
the state's licensing process isn't the
 
02:02:40.550 --> 02:02:40.560 align:start position:0%
proper person
 
02:02:43.589 --> 02:02:43.599 align:start position:0%
to do this type of evaluation it should
 
02:02:47.109 --> 02:02:47.119 align:start position:0%
be the licensed septic designer uh as as
 
02:02:50.149 --> 02:02:50.159 align:start position:0%
part of the written uh text
 
02:02:51.510 --> 02:02:51.520 align:start position:0%
one more i just think it's a good
 
02:02:51.520 --> 02:02:52.310 align:start position:0%
one more i just think it's a good
question

02:02:52.310 --> 02:02:52.320 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:02:54.390 --> 02:02:54.400 align:start position:0%
for a follow-up
 
02:02:54.400 --> 02:02:55.109 align:start position:0%
for a follow-up
are

02:02:55.109 --> 02:02:55.119 align:start position:0%
are
 
02:02:57.830 --> 02:02:57.840 align:start position:0%
are you sure you're firm
 
02:03:01.510 --> 02:03:01.520 align:start position:0%
are you a septic system evaluator i'm
 
02:03:03.830 --> 02:03:03.840 align:start position:0%
both a wetland scientist septic system
 
02:03:06.390 --> 02:03:06.400 align:start position:0%
designer and evaluator okay thank you
 
02:03:08.790 --> 02:03:08.800 align:start position:0%

02:03:52.550 --> 02:03:52.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:56.390 --> 02:03:56.400 align:start position:0%
uh what brad is suddenly on the brad
 
02:03:57.990 --> 02:03:58.000 align:start position:0%
brainland just
 
02:03:59.669 --> 02:03:59.679 align:start position:0%
she should be that concerned okay
 
02:04:02.790 --> 02:04:02.800 align:start position:0%
remember brad hello am i back
 
02:04:06.229 --> 02:04:06.239 align:start position:0%
uh you're back now thank you uh
 
02:04:07.910 --> 02:04:07.920 align:start position:0%
again i'll be very brief especially
 
02:04:10.229 --> 02:04:10.239 align:start position:0%
because it seems like my internet is um
 
02:04:13.510 --> 02:04:13.520 align:start position:0%
not behaving well it's going in and out
 
02:04:15.910 --> 02:04:15.920 align:start position:0%
yes so i'm supporting the bill it's
 
02:04:18.229 --> 02:04:18.239 align:start position:0%
essential that we protect water quality
 
02:04:20.709 --> 02:04:20.719 align:start position:0%
our surface waters our streams our
 
02:04:22.229 --> 02:04:22.239 align:start position:0%
rivers our lakes
 
02:04:25.270 --> 02:04:25.280 align:start position:0%
our tourism recreation businesses depend
 
02:04:27.510 --> 02:04:27.520 align:start position:0%
on new hampshire being a beautiful
 
02:04:30.149 --> 02:04:30.159 align:start position:0%
welcoming safe place for people to come
 
02:04:31.669 --> 02:04:31.679 align:start position:0%
with their families
 
02:04:35.030 --> 02:04:35.040 align:start position:0%
this is a a small fee that would be uh
 
02:04:37.589 --> 02:04:37.599 align:start position:0%
attached and it would give the state the
 
02:04:40.390 --> 02:04:40.400 align:start position:0%
ability to track problems should they
 
02:04:44.470 --> 02:04:44.480 align:start position:0%
arise it can save des money over time if
 
02:04:47.750 --> 02:04:47.760 align:start position:0%
they say there you know we have five
 
02:04:50.070 --> 02:04:50.080 align:start position:0%
cottages on this lake that have been
 
02:04:52.470 --> 02:04:52.480 align:start position:0%
identified as having septic systems that
 
02:04:55.189 --> 02:04:55.199 align:start position:0%
are over 20 years let's go and look
 
02:04:57.030 --> 02:04:57.040 align:start position:0%
there first to see if they are the
 
02:04:59.589 --> 02:04:59.599 align:start position:0%
source of the problem i i think it's a
 
02:05:02.070 --> 02:05:02.080 align:start position:0%
very good start and i'll i'll stop right
 
02:05:05.669 --> 02:05:05.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:09.910 --> 02:05:09.920 align:start position:0%
thank you very much if you've got any
 
02:05:12.310 --> 02:05:12.320 align:start position:0%
no questions from the uh from the
 
02:05:13.830 --> 02:05:13.840 align:start position:0%
members of the committee
 
02:05:18.310 --> 02:05:18.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:20.870 --> 02:05:20.880 align:start position:0%

um three minutes
 
02:05:52.870 --> 02:05:52.880 align:start position:0%
and if um
 
02:05:54.550 --> 02:05:54.560 align:start position:0%
the chair would allow
 
02:05:56.709 --> 02:05:56.719 align:start position:0%
i have a colleague with me uh this
 
02:05:58.950 --> 02:05:58.960 align:start position:0%
morning and rather than having to speak
 
02:06:01.510 --> 02:06:01.520 align:start position:0%
separately i'd like to have ken muller
 
02:06:03.270 --> 02:06:03.280 align:start position:0%
also speak with me
 
02:06:05.669 --> 02:06:05.679 align:start position:0%
okay i'll allow that to
 
02:06:08.550 --> 02:06:08.560 align:start position:0%

visual your
 
02:06:14.830 --> 02:06:14.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:17.270 --> 02:06:17.280 align:start position:0%
there huh
 
02:06:22.950 --> 02:06:22.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:24.310 --> 02:06:24.320 align:start position:0%
here we go
 
02:06:27.109 --> 02:06:27.119 align:start position:0%
sorry about that
 
02:06:29.430 --> 02:06:29.440 align:start position:0%
that's fine continue
 
02:06:29.440 --> 02:06:31.350 align:start position:0%
that's fine continue
okay

02:06:31.350 --> 02:06:31.360 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:06:33.589 --> 02:06:33.599 align:start position:0%
mr chair members of the committee
 
02:06:35.270 --> 02:06:35.280 align:start position:0%
thank you for giving us the opportunity
 
02:06:39.270 --> 02:06:39.280 align:start position:0%
to speak to house bill 426
 
02:06:40.790 --> 02:06:40.800 align:start position:0%
we are pleased to have represented the
 
02:06:43.109 --> 02:06:43.119 align:start position:0%
new hampshire association of realtors on
 
02:06:44.709 --> 02:06:44.719 align:start position:0%
the study commission that brought forth
 
02:06:46.149 --> 02:06:46.159 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
02:06:47.669 --> 02:06:47.679 align:start position:0%
while serving on the commission we
 
02:06:49.990 --> 02:06:50.000 align:start position:0%
thought we were making progress
 
02:06:51.830 --> 02:06:51.840 align:start position:0%
to bring an understanding of how septic
 
02:06:53.430 --> 02:06:53.440 align:start position:0%
system inspections and waterfront
 
02:06:55.189 --> 02:06:55.199 align:start position:0%
property site assessments work to
 
02:06:58.790 --> 02:06:58.800 align:start position:0%
protect both water quality and buyers
 
02:07:01.669 --> 02:07:01.679 align:start position:0%
unfortunately this bill does not reflect
 
02:07:03.510 --> 02:07:03.520 align:start position:0%
that progress
 
02:07:07.350 --> 02:07:07.360 align:start position:0%
the current process is not broken
 
02:07:09.589 --> 02:07:09.599 align:start position:0%
most if not all buyers
 
02:07:11.669 --> 02:07:11.679 align:start position:0%
have a septic inspection done as part of
 
02:07:13.270 --> 02:07:13.280 align:start position:0%
their purchase
 
02:07:15.109 --> 02:07:15.119 align:start position:0%
if problems are found
 
02:07:17.270 --> 02:07:17.280 align:start position:0%
they have opportunities to renegotiate
 
02:07:18.550 --> 02:07:18.560 align:start position:0%
the price
 
02:07:20.950 --> 02:07:20.960 align:start position:0%
withdraw from the purchase
 
02:07:23.510 --> 02:07:23.520 align:start position:0%
or insist that the seller fix
 
02:07:26.950 --> 02:07:26.960 align:start position:0%
the system before purchasing
 
02:07:30.229 --> 02:07:30.239 align:start position:0%
no realtor seller or buyer wants to have
 
02:07:32.069 --> 02:07:32.079 align:start position:0%
a property that causes new hampshire's
 
02:07:34.390 --> 02:07:34.400 align:start position:0%
lakes ponds or rivers to be polluted by
 
02:07:36.149 --> 02:07:36.159 align:start position:0%
a septic system
 
02:07:37.830 --> 02:07:37.840 align:start position:0%
problem properties are being discovered
 
02:07:39.430 --> 02:07:39.440 align:start position:0%
during the real estate sell and buy
 
02:07:39.440 --> 02:07:40.390 align:start position:0%
during the real estate sell and buy
process

02:07:40.390 --> 02:07:40.400 align:start position:0%
process
 
02:07:41.830 --> 02:07:41.840 align:start position:0%
and they're being fixed to today's
 
02:07:45.189 --> 02:07:45.199 align:start position:0%
standards without being mandated
 
02:07:49.990 --> 02:07:50.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:06.920 --> 02:08:06.930 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:06.930 --> 02:08:19.910 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

02:08:19.910 --> 02:08:19.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:22.069 --> 02:08:22.079 align:start position:0%
is he there mr muller
 
02:08:25.189 --> 02:08:25.199 align:start position:0%
i'm here thank you very much mr chair
 
02:08:26.149 --> 02:08:26.159 align:start position:0%
all right
 
02:08:28.950 --> 02:08:28.960 align:start position:0%
continue uh
 
02:08:31.510 --> 02:08:31.520 align:start position:0%
okay we have four major points of
 
02:08:31.520 --> 02:08:32.629 align:start position:0%
okay we have four major points of
concern

02:08:32.629 --> 02:08:32.639 align:start position:0%
concern
 
02:08:36.629 --> 02:08:36.639 align:start position:0%
um one is moving from 250 to 200 feet
 
02:08:39.109 --> 02:08:39.119 align:start position:0%
will affect hundreds if not thousands of
 
02:08:40.709 --> 02:08:40.719 align:start position:0%
properties that would not come under the
 
02:08:42.629 --> 02:08:42.639 align:start position:0%
current rsa
 
02:08:44.709 --> 02:08:44.719 align:start position:0%
the measurement from the reference line
 
02:08:46.790 --> 02:08:46.800 align:start position:0%
is not to the septic system or to the
 
02:08:49.510 --> 02:08:49.520 align:start position:0%
building under the current rsa but any
 
02:08:51.510 --> 02:08:51.520 align:start position:0%
portion of the parcel so that means if
 
02:08:54.470 --> 02:08:54.480 align:start position:0%
one little corner of your property line
 
02:08:55.990 --> 02:08:56.000 align:start position:0%
lies within the
 
02:08:56.000 --> 02:08:58.870 align:start position:0%
lies within the
250

02:08:58.870 --> 02:08:58.880 align:start position:0%
250
 
02:09:01.189 --> 02:09:01.199 align:start position:0%
um you would be subject to this
 
02:09:03.430 --> 02:09:03.440 align:start position:0%
new addendum part of the rsa
 
02:09:05.109 --> 02:09:05.119 align:start position:0%
and number two if the subject inspection
 
02:09:07.030 --> 02:09:07.040 align:start position:0%
report is sent to health official in a
 
02:09:07.040 --> 02:09:08.709 align:start position:0%
report is sent to health official in a
municipality

02:09:08.709 --> 02:09:08.719 align:start position:0%
municipality
 
02:09:10.709 --> 02:09:10.719 align:start position:0%
and it shows that it's non-conforming to
 
02:09:13.270 --> 02:09:13.280 align:start position:0%
current des standards then what
 
02:09:15.030 --> 02:09:15.040 align:start position:0%
and if it's functioning are they going
 
02:09:16.870 --> 02:09:16.880 align:start position:0%
to do something are they going to make
 
02:09:19.910 --> 02:09:19.920 align:start position:0%
it conform and conforming can be like a
 
02:09:21.830 --> 02:09:21.840 align:start position:0%
few years ago they changed the tank size
 
02:09:25.750 --> 02:09:25.760 align:start position:0%
from a thousand to two 1250 gallons that
 
02:09:27.910 --> 02:09:27.920 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean the system is failed it
 
02:09:30.470 --> 02:09:30.480 align:start position:0%
just means the tank size according to ds
 
02:09:32.390 --> 02:09:32.400 align:start position:0%
should have been increased
 
02:09:34.390 --> 02:09:34.400 align:start position:0%
yet we have plenty of thousand gallon
 
02:09:35.990 --> 02:09:36.000 align:start position:0%
septic systems that are
 
02:09:39.189 --> 02:09:39.199 align:start position:0%
well on their way uh working very well
 
02:09:41.030 --> 02:09:41.040 align:start position:0%
so will they insist on the silver make
 
02:09:43.350 --> 02:09:43.360 align:start position:0%
conforming if not in failure or a
 
02:09:46.310 --> 02:09:46.320 align:start position:0%
compromise in any way so we have big
 
02:09:48.550 --> 02:09:48.560 align:start position:0%
concerns about the sort of vagueness of
 
02:09:51.109 --> 02:09:51.119 align:start position:0%
that particular portion of the
 
02:09:51.119 --> 02:09:52.470 align:start position:0%
that particular portion of the
amendment

02:09:52.470 --> 02:09:52.480 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
02:09:53.750 --> 02:09:53.760 align:start position:0%
we also
 
02:09:55.189 --> 02:09:55.199 align:start position:0%
right now under
 
02:09:56.310 --> 02:09:56.320 align:start position:0%
the current
 
02:09:58.390 --> 02:09:58.400 align:start position:0%
site assessment rsa
 
02:10:00.790 --> 02:10:00.800 align:start position:0%
des does not receive anything so if they
 
02:10:02.069 --> 02:10:02.079 align:start position:0%
do receive it
 
02:10:03.430 --> 02:10:03.440 align:start position:0%
what are they going to do with them are
 
02:10:05.430 --> 02:10:05.440 align:start position:0%
they going to create a database and is
 
02:10:06.709 --> 02:10:06.719 align:start position:0%
that going to
 
02:10:09.270 --> 02:10:09.280 align:start position:0%
incur staff time and i'm sure bes will
 
02:10:11.350 --> 02:10:11.360 align:start position:0%
address those issues with you but we
 
02:10:12.950 --> 02:10:12.960 align:start position:0%
have concerned about what that actually
 
02:10:15.669 --> 02:10:15.679 align:start position:0%
means and will there be costs incurred
 
02:10:17.990 --> 02:10:18.000 align:start position:0%
relative to that and a site assessment
 
02:10:21.270 --> 02:10:21.280 align:start position:0%
is prepared by a waste disposal designer
 
02:10:23.270 --> 02:10:23.280 align:start position:0%
a septic inspection is prepared by a
 
02:10:25.990 --> 02:10:26.000 align:start position:0%
licensed septic evaluator these are two
 
02:10:27.910 --> 02:10:27.920 align:start position:0%
separate professions that need to
 
02:10:29.910 --> 02:10:29.920 align:start position:0%
coordinate to work on one assessment
 
02:10:32.149 --> 02:10:32.159 align:start position:0%
because currently the rsa calls for a
 
02:10:34.950 --> 02:10:34.960 align:start position:0%
septic designer to do a site assessment
 
02:10:36.390 --> 02:10:36.400 align:start position:0%
this calls for
 
02:10:39.990 --> 02:10:40.000 align:start position:0%
a septic evaluator so during the process
 
02:10:42.709 --> 02:10:42.719 align:start position:0%
of a purchase and sale typically a buyer
 
02:10:45.990 --> 02:10:46.000 align:start position:0%
gets to choose who they want and we
 
02:10:48.470 --> 02:10:48.480 align:start position:0%
think it's a consumer issue in that
 
02:10:51.430 --> 02:10:51.440 align:start position:0%
right now under this proviso
 
02:10:53.270 --> 02:10:53.280 align:start position:0%
the seller would be obligated to
 
02:10:56.149 --> 02:10:56.159 align:start position:0%
actually do the septic inspection
 
02:10:59.030 --> 02:10:59.040 align:start position:0%
and they would deny the buyer a choice
 
02:11:02.229 --> 02:11:02.239 align:start position:0%
as to whether they want to use their own
 
02:11:04.390 --> 02:11:04.400 align:start position:0%
which is the current process and that's
 
02:11:06.790 --> 02:11:06.800 align:start position:0%
what it goes through
 
02:11:09.030 --> 02:11:09.040 align:start position:0%
these two separate professions and this
 
02:11:10.709 --> 02:11:10.719 align:start position:0%
legislation requires that both create
 
02:11:12.550 --> 02:11:12.560 align:start position:0%
the report currently a site assessment
 
02:11:14.310 --> 02:11:14.320 align:start position:0%
is prepared by the designer we think
 
02:11:17.109 --> 02:11:17.119 align:start position:0%
that's a conflict um you've already been
 
02:11:18.550 --> 02:11:18.560 align:start position:0%
addressed it
 
02:11:21.189 --> 02:11:21.199 align:start position:0%
but we we don't know how to evaluate
 
02:11:22.390 --> 02:11:22.400 align:start position:0%
that where two different people would
 
02:11:25.189 --> 02:11:25.199 align:start position:0%
have to do the evaluation on this so
 
02:11:27.350 --> 02:11:27.360 align:start position:0%
those are our concerns and lynn has a
 
02:11:29.750 --> 02:11:29.760 align:start position:0%
following conclusion okay
 
02:11:32.149 --> 02:11:32.159 align:start position:0%
the marketplace right now is
 
02:11:33.589 --> 02:11:33.599 align:start position:0%
allows buyers to have a septic
 
02:11:35.109 --> 02:11:35.119 align:start position:0%
inspection as a condition of the
 
02:11:36.550 --> 02:11:36.560 align:start position:0%
purchase and sale agreement it's
 
02:11:38.229 --> 02:11:38.239 align:start position:0%
actually in the purchase and sale
 
02:11:40.709 --> 02:11:40.719 align:start position:0%
agreement giving them the opportunity to
 
02:11:43.589 --> 02:11:43.599 align:start position:0%
have that septic inspection the seller
 
02:11:47.750 --> 02:11:47.760 align:start position:0%
already has a disclosure mandated by law
 
02:11:49.350 --> 02:11:49.360 align:start position:0%
that is also
 
02:11:51.910 --> 02:11:51.920 align:start position:0%
given to the buyer prior to purchasing
 
02:11:53.510 --> 02:11:53.520 align:start position:0%
the property
 
02:11:55.830 --> 02:11:55.840 align:start position:0%
so the buyer is fully aware of the size
 
02:11:57.430 --> 02:11:57.440 align:start position:0%
of the septic system what it looks like
 
02:12:00.470 --> 02:12:00.480 align:start position:0%
when they purchase the property
 
02:12:01.830 --> 02:12:01.840 align:start position:0%
should an issue arise during the
 
02:12:03.510 --> 02:12:03.520 align:start position:0%
inspection of course they can negotiate
 
02:12:08.470 --> 02:12:08.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:08.480 --> 02:12:09.750 align:start position:0%
 
under

02:12:09.750 --> 02:12:09.760 align:start position:0%
under
 
02:12:12.229 --> 02:12:12.239 align:start position:0%
um and i think the rest of that is more
 
02:12:13.830 --> 02:12:13.840 align:start position:0%
or less repetitious but the most
 
02:12:15.510 --> 02:12:15.520 align:start position:0%
important thing that i'd like to say is
 
02:12:15.520 --> 02:12:16.709 align:start position:0%
important thing that i'd like to say is
that

02:12:16.709 --> 02:12:16.719 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:12:18.629 --> 02:12:18.639 align:start position:0%
realtors buyers and sellers all want to
 
02:12:20.950 --> 02:12:20.960 align:start position:0%
protect the water and we do believe that
 
02:12:23.030 --> 02:12:23.040 align:start position:0%
the current system is working perfectly
 
02:12:23.040 --> 02:12:23.830 align:start position:0%
the current system is working perfectly
fine

02:12:23.830 --> 02:12:23.840 align:start position:0%
fine
 
02:12:26.550 --> 02:12:26.560 align:start position:0%
um the majority of buyers the vast
 
02:12:28.310 --> 02:12:28.320 align:start position:0%
majority of buyers have a septic
 
02:12:31.030 --> 02:12:31.040 align:start position:0%
inspection prior to purchase
 
02:12:33.270 --> 02:12:33.280 align:start position:0%
the few that don't we are seeing a few
 
02:12:34.950 --> 02:12:34.960 align:start position:0%
others in this economy that are not
 
02:12:37.510 --> 02:12:37.520 align:start position:0%
because of the competitiveness of
 
02:12:37.520 --> 02:12:39.270 align:start position:0%
because of the competitiveness of
um

02:12:39.270 --> 02:12:39.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:12:40.550 --> 02:12:40.560 align:start position:0%
of the market
 
02:12:42.629 --> 02:12:42.639 align:start position:0%
but those that don't are generally
 
02:12:44.229 --> 02:12:44.239 align:start position:0%
people that understand that if there's
 
02:12:46.069 --> 02:12:46.079 align:start position:0%
an issue they'll have to do something
 
02:12:49.669 --> 02:12:49.679 align:start position:0%
about it and are usually
 
02:12:51.990 --> 02:12:52.000 align:start position:0%
in a financial position to take care of
 
02:12:52.000 --> 02:12:53.510 align:start position:0%
in a financial position to take care of
that

02:12:53.510 --> 02:12:53.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:12:55.510 --> 02:12:55.520 align:start position:0%
so we have we do believe the current
 
02:12:57.589 --> 02:12:57.599 align:start position:0%
system is working and we think that this
 
02:12:59.510 --> 02:12:59.520 align:start position:0%
bill needs a good deal of work before it
 
02:13:00.870 --> 02:13:00.880 align:start position:0%
can move forward
 
02:13:03.189 --> 02:13:03.199 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
02:13:05.510 --> 02:13:05.520 align:start position:0%
mr chair one other thing i'd like to
 
02:13:07.189 --> 02:13:07.199 align:start position:0%
mention to piggyback on what lynn just
 
02:13:10.709 --> 02:13:10.719 align:start position:0%
said um july will start my 50th year in
 
02:13:12.550 --> 02:13:12.560 align:start position:0%
real estate and i have never sold a
 
02:13:14.310 --> 02:13:14.320 align:start position:0%
property that hasn't had a septic
 
02:13:14.320 --> 02:13:15.750 align:start position:0%
property that hasn't had a septic
evaluation

02:13:15.750 --> 02:13:15.760 align:start position:0%
evaluation
 
02:13:18.069 --> 02:13:18.079 align:start position:0%
but we really want to
 
02:13:19.589 --> 02:13:19.599 align:start position:0%
demonstrate to the committee that we
 
02:13:21.589 --> 02:13:21.599 align:start position:0%
really think it's a consumer protection
 
02:13:23.510 --> 02:13:23.520 align:start position:0%
situation where the buyer should have
 
02:13:25.589 --> 02:13:25.599 align:start position:0%
the choice and the buyer should get to
 
02:13:27.910 --> 02:13:27.920 align:start position:0%
select who they want to evaluate their
 
02:13:27.920 --> 02:13:29.510 align:start position:0%
select who they want to evaluate their
septic

02:13:29.510 --> 02:13:29.520 align:start position:0%
septic
 
02:13:32.550 --> 02:13:32.560 align:start position:0%
and i can assure the committee that um
 
02:13:33.830 --> 02:13:33.840 align:start position:0%
even though
 
02:13:35.430 --> 02:13:35.440 align:start position:0%
representative spang had mentioned that
 
02:13:36.950 --> 02:13:36.960 align:start position:0%
buyers buy property and they don't know
 
02:13:38.310 --> 02:13:38.320 align:start position:0%
what they're buying
 
02:13:40.149 --> 02:13:40.159 align:start position:0%
it's never happened in my career and i
 
02:13:42.069 --> 02:13:42.079 align:start position:0%
know in lynn's
 
02:13:43.510 --> 02:13:43.520 align:start position:0%
we're very aware whether we list
 
02:13:46.069 --> 02:13:46.079 align:start position:0%
property or we represent buyers we want
 
02:13:47.510 --> 02:13:47.520 align:start position:0%
to make sure that they know what they're
 
02:13:49.669 --> 02:13:49.679 align:start position:0%
getting and that's where the negotiation
 
02:13:51.589 --> 02:13:51.599 align:start position:0%
comes and that's why
 
02:13:51.599 --> 02:13:52.470 align:start position:0%
comes and that's why
um

02:13:52.470 --> 02:13:52.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:13:55.030 --> 02:13:55.040 align:start position:0%
things get fixed and that's why
 
02:13:57.510 --> 02:13:57.520 align:start position:0%
after a property gets sold there usually
 
02:13:59.910 --> 02:13:59.920 align:start position:0%
is a combination for the septic system
 
02:14:02.709 --> 02:14:02.719 align:start position:0%
and sometimes a septic system can work
 
02:14:04.229 --> 02:14:04.239 align:start position:0%
perfectly fine
 
02:14:06.550 --> 02:14:06.560 align:start position:0%
but somebody who evaluated it for them
 
02:14:08.470 --> 02:14:08.480 align:start position:0%
says if you want to extend the life of
 
02:14:09.990 --> 02:14:10.000 align:start position:0%
elite field you need to put a venting
 
02:14:12.069 --> 02:14:12.079 align:start position:0%
system in or you might want to replace
 
02:14:14.229 --> 02:14:14.239 align:start position:0%
that d box and even little things that
 
02:14:16.149 --> 02:14:16.159 align:start position:0%
don't affect uh
 
02:14:18.390 --> 02:14:18.400 align:start position:0%
whether it's failed or passed those
 
02:14:19.830 --> 02:14:19.840 align:start position:0%
things do get addressed and a lot of
 
02:14:21.510 --> 02:14:21.520 align:start position:0%
times the sellers will do that or the
 
02:14:23.430 --> 02:14:23.440 align:start position:0%
buyer will take it upon themselves to
 
02:14:25.750 --> 02:14:25.760 align:start position:0%
fix it after the fact so thank you very
 
02:14:27.430 --> 02:14:27.440 align:start position:0%
much mr chairman we're happy to take any
 
02:14:27.440 --> 02:14:29.109 align:start position:0%
much mr chairman we're happy to take any
questions

02:14:29.109 --> 02:14:29.119 align:start position:0%
questions
 
02:14:33.350 --> 02:14:33.360 align:start position:0%
before i help with the questions uh
 
02:14:35.510 --> 02:14:35.520 align:start position:0%
ms merrill or mr mueller have you uh
 
02:14:38.149 --> 02:14:38.159 align:start position:0%
submitted this your testimony uh to this
 
02:14:38.159 --> 02:14:39.109 align:start position:0%

we will right after this hearing
 
02:14:44.069 --> 02:14:44.079 align:start position:0%
i would appreciate that thank you
 
02:14:46.550 --> 02:14:46.560 align:start position:0%
kelly for a question
 
02:14:49.669 --> 02:14:49.679 align:start position:0%
representative kelly for a question
 
02:14:51.350 --> 02:14:51.360 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you both
 
02:14:53.510 --> 02:14:53.520 align:start position:0%
for being here today um my question uh
 
02:14:56.310 --> 02:14:56.320 align:start position:0%
mr albert had mentioned before that uh
 
02:14:58.470 --> 02:14:58.480 align:start position:0%
septic evaluators aren't
 
02:15:01.030 --> 02:15:01.040 align:start position:0%
um qualified to do the full
 
02:15:02.390 --> 02:15:02.400 align:start position:0%
bleach field
 
02:15:05.510 --> 02:15:05.520 align:start position:0%
uh evaluation that's necessary did i
 
02:15:07.270 --> 02:15:07.280 align:start position:0%
under current law or
 
02:15:09.189 --> 02:15:09.199 align:start position:0%
is the market in the current marketplace
 
02:15:09.199 --> 02:15:09.990 align:start position:0%
is the market in the current marketplace
do

02:15:09.990 --> 02:15:10.000 align:start position:0%
do
 
02:15:12.149 --> 02:15:12.159 align:start position:0%
do you approach a septic evaluator or a
 
02:15:13.669 --> 02:15:13.679 align:start position:0%
septic designer
 
02:15:15.830 --> 02:15:15.840 align:start position:0%
to have that evaluation done
 
02:15:17.189 --> 02:15:17.199 align:start position:0%
we do both
 
02:15:19.109 --> 02:15:19.119 align:start position:0%
the septic designer does the site
 
02:15:19.119 --> 02:15:20.550 align:start position:0%
the septic designer does the site
assessment

02:15:20.550 --> 02:15:20.560 align:start position:0%
assessment
 
02:15:22.709 --> 02:15:22.719 align:start position:0%
and the septic evaluator does the
 
02:15:25.669 --> 02:15:25.679 align:start position:0%
inspection for the buyer
 
02:15:28.310 --> 02:15:28.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:29.990 --> 02:15:30.000 align:start position:0%
representative gunski for a question
 
02:15:31.430 --> 02:15:31.440 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
02:15:33.750 --> 02:15:33.760 align:start position:0%
i i believe is it
 
02:15:34.950 --> 02:15:34.960 align:start position:0%
mr mueller
 
02:15:39.030 --> 02:15:39.040 align:start position:0%
yes you had stated that in your 50 years
 
02:15:41.910 --> 02:15:41.920 align:start position:0%
you haven't actually had a property sold
 
02:15:43.669 --> 02:15:43.679 align:start position:0%
that was not uh
 
02:15:47.430 --> 02:15:47.440 align:start position:0%
done with a without a septic inspection
 
02:15:49.990 --> 02:15:50.000 align:start position:0%
but your counterpart had mentioned most
 
02:15:50.000 --> 02:15:50.709 align:start position:0%
but your counterpart had mentioned most
so

02:15:50.709 --> 02:15:50.719 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:15:52.310 --> 02:15:52.320 align:start position:0%
just give me your best judgment as far
 
02:15:54.069 --> 02:15:54.079 align:start position:0%
as you being a professional in your
 
02:15:54.079 --> 02:15:55.350 align:start position:0%
as you being a professional in your
industry

02:15:55.350 --> 02:15:55.360 align:start position:0%
industry
 
02:15:56.790 --> 02:15:56.800 align:start position:0%
is it uncommon or what kind of
 
02:15:58.950 --> 02:15:58.960 align:start position:0%
percentage are we talking quantify that
 
02:16:02.229 --> 02:16:02.239 align:start position:0%
like maybe statewide is it 98 99 i'm
 
02:16:05.189 --> 02:16:05.199 align:start position:0%
just looking for a figure if i could
 
02:16:07.270 --> 02:16:07.280 align:start position:0%
to be honest it depends on market
 
02:16:09.830 --> 02:16:09.840 align:start position:0%
conditions um if the buyer thinks that
 
02:16:11.430 --> 02:16:11.440 align:start position:0%
they have leverage um they're going to
 
02:16:13.109 --> 02:16:13.119 align:start position:0%
put a lot of conditions on the purchase
 
02:16:14.709 --> 02:16:14.719 align:start position:0%
and sale to make sure they know exactly
 
02:16:16.149 --> 02:16:16.159 align:start position:0%
what they're getting
 
02:16:18.470 --> 02:16:18.480 align:start position:0%
we're right now in a marketplace that in
 
02:16:20.310 --> 02:16:20.320 align:start position:0%
my 50 years i've never seen where
 
02:16:20.320 --> 02:16:21.510 align:start position:0%
my 50 years i've never seen where
there's

02:16:21.510 --> 02:16:21.520 align:start position:0%
there's
 
02:16:24.149 --> 02:16:24.159 align:start position:0%
virtually no inventory whatsoever so
 
02:16:25.589 --> 02:16:25.599 align:start position:0%
when a property does come up whether
 
02:16:27.750 --> 02:16:27.760 align:start position:0%
it's on a lake or not on a lake um
 
02:16:29.430 --> 02:16:29.440 align:start position:0%
people are tripping over themselves to
 
02:16:31.350 --> 02:16:31.360 align:start position:0%
get it so a lot of times they're being
 
02:16:32.950 --> 02:16:32.960 align:start position:0%
advised by people
 
02:16:34.629 --> 02:16:34.639 align:start position:0%
don't put any conditions in order to get
 
02:16:36.950 --> 02:16:36.960 align:start position:0%
this property but i can assure you that
 
02:16:39.750 --> 02:16:39.760 align:start position:0%
i haven't sold one of those but if they
 
02:16:42.230 --> 02:16:42.240 align:start position:0%
if they had been a lot of buyers even
 
02:16:43.509 --> 02:16:43.519 align:start position:0%
though they're trying to secure the
 
02:16:45.669 --> 02:16:45.679 align:start position:0%
property that way they will get the
 
02:16:48.309 --> 02:16:48.319 align:start position:0%
inspections done either simultaneous to
 
02:16:50.709 --> 02:16:50.719 align:start position:0%
waiting for the closing or immediately
 
02:16:52.070 --> 02:16:52.080 align:start position:0%
after the close
 
02:16:52.080 --> 02:16:52.870 align:start position:0%
after the close
so

02:16:52.870 --> 02:16:52.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:16:54.950 --> 02:16:54.960 align:start position:0%
somebody who's buying a 2 million lake
 
02:16:56.469 --> 02:16:56.479 align:start position:0%
property certainly doesn't want to have
 
02:16:58.629 --> 02:16:58.639 align:start position:0%
a polluting septic system on it
 
02:17:00.150 --> 02:17:00.160 align:start position:0%
but they have the wherewithal to make
 
02:17:02.549 --> 02:17:02.559 align:start position:0%
that happen after the fact
 
02:17:05.589 --> 02:17:05.599 align:start position:0%
and i can tell you that until this year
 
02:17:05.599 --> 02:17:06.709 align:start position:0%
and i can tell you that until this year
i

02:17:06.709 --> 02:17:06.719 align:start position:0%
i
 
02:17:08.469 --> 02:17:08.479 align:start position:0%
never had a property without a septic
 
02:17:08.479 --> 02:17:09.669 align:start position:0%
never had a property without a septic
inspection

02:17:09.669 --> 02:17:09.679 align:start position:0%
inspection
 
02:17:11.750 --> 02:17:11.760 align:start position:0%
this year there have been several
 
02:17:11.760 --> 02:17:12.790 align:start position:0%
this year there have been several
without

02:17:12.790 --> 02:17:12.800 align:start position:0%
without
 
02:17:16.629 --> 02:17:16.639 align:start position:0%
um so i want to say maybe 95 98
 
02:17:19.509 --> 02:17:19.519 align:start position:0%
have septic inspections those that don't
 
02:17:21.990 --> 02:17:22.000 align:start position:0%
generally either have a brand new septic
 
02:17:23.910 --> 02:17:23.920 align:start position:0%
system already in place or something
 
02:17:25.910 --> 02:17:25.920 align:start position:0%
recently replaced
 
02:17:25.920 --> 02:17:26.830 align:start position:0%
recently replaced
or

02:17:26.830 --> 02:17:26.840 align:start position:0%
or
 
02:17:30.389 --> 02:17:30.399 align:start position:0%
um have a or have the financial means i
 
02:17:31.990 --> 02:17:32.000 align:start position:0%
did have one purchase person that did
 
02:17:33.349 --> 02:17:33.359 align:start position:0%
purchase a home without a septic
 
02:17:35.429 --> 02:17:35.439 align:start position:0%
inspection this year he said you know
 
02:17:38.150 --> 02:17:38.160 align:start position:0%
it's going to cost me 15 to 20 000 to
 
02:17:40.150 --> 02:17:40.160 align:start position:0%
put in a new system i don't want it to
 
02:17:41.910 --> 02:17:41.920 align:start position:0%
affect the sale i want to buy it if i
 
02:17:43.750 --> 02:17:43.760 align:start position:0%
need a new system i have the money i'll
 
02:17:46.070 --> 02:17:46.080 align:start position:0%
put it in i don't i'll do that
 
02:17:48.469 --> 02:17:48.479 align:start position:0%
i'll do the inspection after
 
02:17:53.110 --> 02:17:53.120 align:start position:0%
the uh closing i had one other that um
 
02:17:56.070 --> 02:17:56.080 align:start position:0%
did not want to do the inspection uh for
 
02:17:57.750 --> 02:17:57.760 align:start position:0%
the seller to do anything but they did
 
02:18:00.709 --> 02:18:00.719 align:start position:0%
indeed do the inspection uh prior to but
 
02:18:02.309 --> 02:18:02.319 align:start position:0%
it was not a condition of sale it was
 
02:18:03.750 --> 02:18:03.760 align:start position:0%
just so that they would know what it was
 
02:18:05.190 --> 02:18:05.200 align:start position:0%
they were buying and if there was an
 
02:18:07.509 --> 02:18:07.519 align:start position:0%
issue with the septic then they would uh
 
02:18:10.790 --> 02:18:10.800 align:start position:0%
take care of it as soon as they moved in
 
02:18:12.870 --> 02:18:12.880 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:18:15.669 --> 02:18:15.679 align:start position:0%
representative cohen for a question
 
02:18:18.070 --> 02:18:18.080 align:start position:0%
yes i have a question for mr mueller
 
02:18:19.910 --> 02:18:19.920 align:start position:0%
please uh thank you for taking my
 
02:18:23.270 --> 02:18:23.280 align:start position:0%
question mr muller under the current law
 
02:18:26.870 --> 02:18:26.880 align:start position:0%
can a person who is selling a camp on a
 
02:18:29.910 --> 02:18:29.920 align:start position:0%
lake that has a failing septic system
 
02:18:32.709 --> 02:18:32.719 align:start position:0%
complete that sale and then the person
 
02:18:35.669 --> 02:18:35.679 align:start position:0%
buy that camp just go about their merry
 
02:18:37.990 --> 02:18:38.000 align:start position:0%
way using the camp for another 5 10
 
02:18:40.309 --> 02:18:40.319 align:start position:0%
whatever years with the failing septic
 
02:18:42.309 --> 02:18:42.319 align:start position:0%
system legally
 
02:18:44.790 --> 02:18:44.800 align:start position:0%
um in my opinion here's what i would do
 
02:18:47.110 --> 02:18:47.120 align:start position:0%
if i encountered a listing and i could
 
02:18:48.790 --> 02:18:48.800 align:start position:0%
see the effluent for instance coming out
 
02:18:50.549 --> 02:18:50.559 align:start position:0%
of the ground even before the site
 
02:18:52.629 --> 02:18:52.639 align:start position:0%
assessment was done
 
02:18:54.469 --> 02:18:54.479 align:start position:0%
what i would do is advise them that we
 
02:18:56.790 --> 02:18:56.800 align:start position:0%
can't sell the property like that
 
02:18:58.549 --> 02:18:58.559 align:start position:0%
but it's what we call in the business a
 
02:19:00.150 --> 02:19:00.160 align:start position:0%
material defect
 
02:19:02.230 --> 02:19:02.240 align:start position:0%
so every consumer that's going to look
 
02:19:03.990 --> 02:19:04.000 align:start position:0%
at that property would be told by the
 
02:19:05.349 --> 02:19:05.359 align:start position:0%
listing agent
 
02:19:08.070 --> 02:19:08.080 align:start position:0%
uh certainly by their buying
 
02:19:10.389 --> 02:19:10.399 align:start position:0%
agent that's representing them as well
 
02:19:11.830 --> 02:19:11.840 align:start position:0%
that that is
 
02:19:13.750 --> 02:19:13.760 align:start position:0%
has no standing plus the health officers
 
02:19:16.150 --> 02:19:16.160 align:start position:0%
in town would be alerted as to a failed
 
02:19:18.309 --> 02:19:18.319 align:start position:0%
septic system so to answer your question
 
02:19:20.230 --> 02:19:20.240 align:start position:0%
no it wouldn't be conveyed and it
 
02:19:22.469 --> 02:19:22.479 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be conveyed uh for very long
 
02:19:24.950 --> 02:19:24.960 align:start position:0%
without getting fixed if it was conveyed
 
02:19:26.870 --> 02:19:26.880 align:start position:0%
and i certainly if i encountered one i
 
02:19:28.309 --> 02:19:28.319 align:start position:0%
would certainly report it that it's a
 
02:19:30.709 --> 02:19:30.719 align:start position:0%
failed system and educate my seller as
 
02:19:32.549 --> 02:19:32.559 align:start position:0%
to what needs to happen
 
02:19:35.190 --> 02:19:35.200 align:start position:0%
follow-on question mr chairperson or a
 
02:19:38.309 --> 02:19:38.319 align:start position:0%
follow-up yes mr mueller just for my
 
02:19:41.110 --> 02:19:41.120 align:start position:0%
education how would that help officer
 
02:19:43.910 --> 02:19:43.920 align:start position:0%
know that that uh system is failing you
 
02:19:45.349 --> 02:19:45.359 align:start position:0%
just talked about
 
02:19:48.150 --> 02:19:48.160 align:start position:0%
well in a case where it wasn't obvious
 
02:19:51.750 --> 02:19:51.760 align:start position:0%
and it had us a septic evaluation done
 
02:19:54.469 --> 02:19:54.479 align:start position:0%
um the site assessment actually is sort
 
02:19:56.870 --> 02:19:56.880 align:start position:0%
of an observation of what they see on
 
02:19:58.950 --> 02:19:58.960 align:start position:0%
the ground so it might be
 
02:20:01.030 --> 02:20:01.040 align:start position:0%
caught in the site assessment
 
02:20:03.510 --> 02:20:03.520 align:start position:0%
but if not when a buyer goes to buy it
 
02:20:06.950 --> 02:20:06.960 align:start position:0%
and they do a septic inspection um and
 
02:20:08.950 --> 02:20:08.960 align:start position:0%
they find it to be failed then they're
 
02:20:11.590 --> 02:20:11.600 align:start position:0%
going to either walk away from the sale
 
02:20:13.110 --> 02:20:13.120 align:start position:0%
they're going to negotiate a difference
 
02:20:14.630 --> 02:20:14.640 align:start position:0%
in the price
 
02:20:17.750 --> 02:20:17.760 align:start position:0%
and escrow the money um to have it fixed
 
02:20:21.830 --> 02:20:21.840 align:start position:0%
prior to closing um or they're going to
 
02:20:21.840 --> 02:20:22.950 align:start position:0%
prior to closing um or they're going to
um

02:20:22.950 --> 02:20:22.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:20:25.110 --> 02:20:25.120 align:start position:0%
fix it themselves uh with the monies
 
02:20:26.550 --> 02:20:26.560 align:start position:0%
that they have when they purchase the
 
02:20:28.630 --> 02:20:28.640 align:start position:0%
property at a reduced price
 
02:20:31.270 --> 02:20:31.280 align:start position:0%
thank you for the response
 
02:20:31.280 --> 02:20:32.230 align:start position:0%

when improperly designed installed or
 
02:21:50.870 --> 02:21:50.880 align:start position:0%
maintained septic systems can pollute
 
02:21:52.790 --> 02:21:52.800 align:start position:0%
our lakes ponds and rivers with an

adequately treated wastewater this

direct threat to water quality also

clean water policies and responsible use
 
02:22:13.590 --> 02:22:13.600 align:start position:0%
we understand that inadequate septic
 
02:22:15.270 --> 02:22:15.280 align:start position:0%
systems can leach pollutants such as
 
02:22:17.270 --> 02:22:17.280 align:start position:0%
phosphorus and nitrogen along with
 
02:22:19.270 --> 02:22:19.280 align:start position:0%
disease-causing pathogens into nearby

surface water bodies
 
02:22:22.870 --> 02:22:22.880 align:start position:0%
and in a natural increase in phosphorus
 
02:22:25.270 --> 02:22:25.280 align:start position:0%

illness
 
02:22:36.790 --> 02:22:36.800 align:start position:0%
in in the septic study commission
 
02:22:38.469 --> 02:22:38.479 align:start position:0%
process we've heard from our membership
 
02:22:40.710 --> 02:22:40.720 align:start position:0%
and partners that member many new
 
02:22:42.790 --> 02:22:42.800 align:start position:0%
hampshire lakeside property owners
 
02:22:45.030 --> 02:22:45.040 align:start position:0%
struggle with adequately maintaining
 
02:22:47.429 --> 02:22:47.439 align:start position:0%
their antiquated septic systems many of
 
02:22:50.230 --> 02:22:50.240 align:start position:0%
which predate state required inspections
 
02:22:51.750 --> 02:22:51.760 align:start position:0%
many of these seasonal camps have been
 
02:22:53.830 --> 02:22:53.840 align:start position:0%
renovated to accommodate
 
02:22:55.429 --> 02:22:55.439 align:start position:0%
three to four season living and
 
02:22:57.910 --> 02:22:57.920 align:start position:0%
additional bedrooms and older on-site
 
02:22:59.590 --> 02:22:59.600 align:start position:0%
septic systems are often not well
 
02:23:02.389 --> 02:23:02.399 align:start position:0%
documented by the homeowner or upgraded
 
02:23:04.150 --> 02:23:04.160 align:start position:0%
based on changes to property use which
 
02:23:05.830 --> 02:23:05.840 align:start position:0%
results in a lack of knowledge about the
 
02:23:08.630 --> 02:23:08.640 align:start position:0%
age condition and capacity of the system
 
02:23:10.309 --> 02:23:10.319 align:start position:0%
and the likelihood of it being unable to
 
02:23:12.389 --> 02:23:12.399 align:start position:0%
meet the demands placed upon it
 
02:23:14.950 --> 02:23:14.960 align:start position:0%
a more robust septic system evaluations
 
02:23:16.630 --> 02:23:16.640 align:start position:0%
at the time of property transfer is a
 
02:23:18.469 --> 02:23:18.479 align:start position:0%
good way to catch underperforming
 
02:23:20.630 --> 02:23:20.640 align:start position:0%
systems that are either on inspection
 
02:23:22.790 --> 02:23:22.800 align:start position:0%
uninspected or the inspection of which
 
02:23:25.110 --> 02:23:25.120 align:start position:0%
is out of date it's typically very easy
 
02:23:27.349 --> 02:23:27.359 align:start position:0%
to identify septic systems in outright
 
02:23:29.750 --> 02:23:29.760 align:start position:0%
failure but often difficult to identify
 
02:23:31.750 --> 02:23:31.760 align:start position:0%
systems that are underperforming without
 
02:23:33.910 --> 02:23:33.920 align:start position:0%
a more thorough inspection
 
02:23:35.349 --> 02:23:35.359 align:start position:0%
the requirement to submit site
 
02:23:37.030 --> 02:23:37.040 align:start position:0%
assessments to local health officials
 
02:23:38.309 --> 02:23:38.319 align:start position:0%
and the new hampshire department of
 
02:23:40.469 --> 02:23:40.479 align:start position:0%
environmental services will assist the
 
02:23:42.309 --> 02:23:42.319 align:start position:0%
state in determining the number of
 
02:23:44.630 --> 02:23:44.640 align:start position:0%
uninspected and outdated systems and
 
02:23:46.710 --> 02:23:46.720 align:start position:0%
will give homeowners opportunities to
 
02:23:49.750 --> 02:23:49.760 align:start position:0%
identify and update systems um so we
 
02:23:53.670 --> 02:23:53.680 align:start position:0%
urge you to vote ought to pass on hp 426
 
02:23:55.670 --> 02:23:55.680 align:start position:0%
which is we feel an important step
 
02:23:58.150 --> 02:23:58.160 align:start position:0%
forward in addressing inadequate systems
 
02:23:59.750 --> 02:23:59.760 align:start position:0%
and their threats to public health and
 
02:24:01.990 --> 02:24:02.000 align:start position:0%
water quality and helping to keep new
 
02:24:04.309 --> 02:24:04.319 align:start position:0%

bill
um

02:25:13.750 --> 02:25:13.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:25:15.910 --> 02:25:15.920 align:start position:0%
the lake winnipesaukee association has
 
02:25:17.590 --> 02:25:17.600 align:start position:0%
some um
 
02:25:19.349 --> 02:25:19.359 align:start position:0%
actual numbers that we'd like to share
 
02:25:20.630 --> 02:25:20.640 align:start position:0%
with you
 
02:25:22.150 --> 02:25:22.160 align:start position:0%
um about
 
02:25:24.550 --> 02:25:24.560 align:start position:0%
what we've seen on one lake which is
 
02:25:29.830 --> 02:25:29.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:29.840 --> 02:25:30.630 align:start position:0%
 
we

02:25:30.630 --> 02:25:30.640 align:start position:0%
we
 
02:25:35.110 --> 02:25:35.120 align:start position:0%
in 2016 we completed uh an evaluation of
 
02:25:38.790 --> 02:25:38.800 align:start position:0%
the number of septic systems around
 
02:25:41.349 --> 02:25:41.359 align:start position:0%
lake wacky one within 250 feet of the
 
02:25:41.359 --> 02:25:42.469 align:start position:0%
lake wacky one within 250 feet of the
shoreline

02:25:42.469 --> 02:25:42.479 align:start position:0%
shoreline
 
02:25:45.190 --> 02:25:45.200 align:start position:0%
lake wachuan is the water supply for the
 
02:25:46.790 --> 02:25:46.800 align:start position:0%
town of meredith
 
02:25:48.790 --> 02:25:48.800 align:start position:0%
so we were working with the town of
 
02:25:52.630 --> 02:25:52.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:56.870 --> 02:25:56.880 align:start position:0%
we found 181 septic systems within 250
 
02:25:59.590 --> 02:25:59.600 align:start position:0%
feet of the shoreline on waukeuan
 
02:25:59.600 --> 02:26:00.870 align:start position:0%
feet of the shoreline on waukeuan
91

02:26:00.870 --> 02:26:00.880 align:start position:0%
91
 
02:26:02.710 --> 02:26:02.720 align:start position:0%
of those systems were installed before
 
02:26:02.720 --> 02:26:04.230 align:start position:0%
of those systems were installed before
1983

02:26:04.230 --> 02:26:04.240 align:start position:0%
1983
 
02:26:05.990 --> 02:26:06.000 align:start position:0%
which is the end of the average expected
 
02:26:08.790 --> 02:26:08.800 align:start position:0%
20 to 30-year lifespan
 
02:26:11.670 --> 02:26:11.680 align:start position:0%
and 49 of them were installed prior to
 
02:26:14.710 --> 02:26:14.720 align:start position:0%
1967 which is well beyond the expected
 
02:26:17.670 --> 02:26:17.680 align:start position:0%
life span of most septic systems
 
02:26:18.950 --> 02:26:18.960 align:start position:0%
um we
 
02:26:21.830 --> 02:26:21.840 align:start position:0%
had funding to work with homeowners
 
02:26:23.670 --> 02:26:23.680 align:start position:0%
that were willing to do so
 
02:26:26.070 --> 02:26:26.080 align:start position:0%
um and we
 
02:26:28.710 --> 02:26:28.720 align:start position:0%
we studied and had helped them
 
02:26:28.720 --> 02:26:30.070 align:start position:0%
we studied and had helped them
financially

02:26:30.070 --> 02:26:30.080 align:start position:0%
financially
 
02:26:30.080 --> 02:26:30.870 align:start position:0%
financially
get

02:26:30.870 --> 02:26:30.880 align:start position:0%
get
 
02:26:32.790 --> 02:26:32.800 align:start position:0%
professional evaluations of their septic
 
02:26:36.389 --> 02:26:36.399 align:start position:0%
system so there are 24 homeowners
 
02:26:40.230 --> 02:26:40.240 align:start position:0%
and we were able to test 24 of those
 
02:26:41.750 --> 02:26:41.760 align:start position:0%
septic systems
 
02:26:43.670 --> 02:26:43.680 align:start position:0%
and we determined that 13 of them were
 
02:26:45.110 --> 02:26:45.120 align:start position:0%
in failure
 
02:26:47.429 --> 02:26:47.439 align:start position:0%
um so that's 54
 
02:26:49.750 --> 02:26:49.760 align:start position:0%
of the systems that we were actually
 
02:26:49.760 --> 02:26:51.429 align:start position:0%
of the systems that we were actually
testing

02:26:51.429 --> 02:26:51.439 align:start position:0%
testing
 
02:26:55.830 --> 02:26:55.840 align:start position:0%
so that's 24 out of 181 septic systems
 
02:26:59.190 --> 02:26:59.200 align:start position:0%
lake wacky one does have an issue of
 
02:27:01.030 --> 02:27:01.040 align:start position:0%
nutrient loading
 
02:27:04.389 --> 02:27:04.399 align:start position:0%
excess nutrients uh primarily phosphorus
 
02:27:04.399 --> 02:27:05.349 align:start position:0%
excess nutrients uh primarily phosphorus
and

02:27:05.349 --> 02:27:05.359 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:27:07.510 --> 02:27:07.520 align:start position:0%
about nine percent of that
 
02:27:08.870 --> 02:27:08.880 align:start position:0%
nutrient load
 
02:27:11.910 --> 02:27:11.920 align:start position:0%
is because of septic systems that's a
 
02:27:16.070 --> 02:27:16.080 align:start position:0%
a report that we had done prior to 2016.
 
02:27:16.080 --> 02:27:17.670 align:start position:0%
a report that we had done prior to 2016.
um

02:27:17.670 --> 02:27:17.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:27:19.030 --> 02:27:19.040 align:start position:0%
i would point out that prior to the
 
02:27:21.110 --> 02:27:21.120 align:start position:0%
evaluation the homeowners were not aware
 
02:27:23.750 --> 02:27:23.760 align:start position:0%
that their systems were in failure or
 
02:27:25.670 --> 02:27:25.680 align:start position:0%
even impaired
 
02:27:27.910 --> 02:27:27.920 align:start position:0%
so there were no observable
 
02:27:29.750 --> 02:27:29.760 align:start position:0%
issues at the surface for several of
 
02:27:29.760 --> 02:27:32.389 align:start position:0%
issues at the surface for several of
them

02:27:32.389 --> 02:27:32.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:34.630 --> 02:27:34.640 align:start position:0%
and so from our findings it is clear
 
02:27:37.110 --> 02:27:37.120 align:start position:0%
that implementing uh evaluations of
 
02:27:39.349 --> 02:27:39.359 align:start position:0%
older septic systems at least at the
 
02:27:40.950 --> 02:27:40.960 align:start position:0%
point of sale
 
02:27:43.510 --> 02:27:43.520 align:start position:0%
would clearly serve public health
 
02:27:48.630 --> 02:27:48.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:51.030 --> 02:27:51.040 align:start position:0%
if there's no obvious data or not data
 
02:27:53.429 --> 02:27:53.439 align:start position:0%
but evidence at the surface
 
02:27:56.070 --> 02:27:56.080 align:start position:0%
and someone decides not to do
 
02:27:56.080 --> 02:27:56.790 align:start position:0%
and someone decides not to do
a

02:27:56.790 --> 02:27:56.800 align:start position:0%
a
 
02:27:59.670 --> 02:27:59.680 align:start position:0%
an evaluation it most certainly could
 
02:27:59.680 --> 02:28:00.630 align:start position:0%
an evaluation it most certainly could
occur

02:28:00.630 --> 02:28:00.640 align:start position:0%
occur
 
02:28:03.270 --> 02:28:03.280 align:start position:0%
that a home with a failing septic system
 
02:28:06.389 --> 02:28:06.399 align:start position:0%
could be sold to someone and used by the
 
02:28:08.150 --> 02:28:08.160 align:start position:0%
new owner for 10 years without them
 
02:28:12.389 --> 02:28:12.399 align:start position:0%
doing anything about the septic system
 
02:28:12.399 --> 02:28:13.510 align:start position:0%
doing anything about the septic system
so

02:28:13.510 --> 02:28:13.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:28:16.230 --> 02:28:16.240 align:start position:0%
in closing we urge you to
 
02:28:19.670 --> 02:28:19.680 align:start position:0%
vote ought to pass on hp 426
 
02:28:19.680 --> 02:28:20.710 align:start position:0%
vote ought to pass on hp 426
and

02:28:31.439 --> 02:28:32.309 align:start position:0%
representative gunski thank you mr
chairman

02:28:32.309 --> 02:28:32.319 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
02:28:33.750 --> 02:28:33.760 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question just
 
02:28:35.590 --> 02:28:35.600 align:start position:0%
got a question i i
 
02:28:39.349 --> 02:28:39.359 align:start position:0%
your your study on lake waukewan
 
02:28:41.750 --> 02:28:41.760 align:start position:0%
was about existing homes and this
 
02:28:43.349 --> 02:28:43.359 align:start position:0%
what we're hearing this bill is about
 
02:28:44.710 --> 02:28:44.720 align:start position:0%
the sale
 
02:28:46.550 --> 02:28:46.560 align:start position:0%
basically of a home
 
02:28:48.710 --> 02:28:48.720 align:start position:0%
and is there any information as far as i
 
02:28:50.389 --> 02:28:50.399 align:start position:0%
mean have any of these homes on that
 
02:28:53.349 --> 02:28:53.359 align:start position:0%
particular water or body of water
 
02:28:54.870 --> 02:28:54.880 align:start position:0%
especially the 24 that you did
 
02:28:57.190 --> 02:28:57.200 align:start position:0%
evaluations on if they've been sold
 
02:28:58.710 --> 02:28:58.720 align:start position:0%
i mean
 
02:29:00.070 --> 02:29:00.080 align:start position:0%
difficult one for you to answer but do
 
02:29:01.510 --> 02:29:01.520 align:start position:0%
you know if any of these have changed
 
02:29:03.429 --> 02:29:03.439 align:start position:0%
ownership and how was that handled if
 
02:29:04.630 --> 02:29:04.640 align:start position:0%
they were
 
02:29:09.190 --> 02:29:09.200 align:start position:0%
oh um i believe that uh we don't know if
 
02:29:10.710 --> 02:29:10.720 align:start position:0%
all of them we don't know the status of
 
02:29:12.309 --> 02:29:12.319 align:start position:0%
all of them but i do know that at least
 
02:29:13.910 --> 02:29:13.920 align:start position:0%
one of them was in the process of being
 
02:29:13.920 --> 02:29:14.950 align:start position:0%
one of them was in the process of being
sold

02:29:14.950 --> 02:29:14.960 align:start position:0%
sold
 
02:29:16.630 --> 02:29:16.640 align:start position:0%
um or
 
02:29:19.030 --> 02:29:19.040 align:start position:0%
the intent was to sell the home right at
 
02:29:21.030 --> 02:29:21.040 align:start position:0%
the time that we were doing the study
 
02:29:25.670 --> 02:29:25.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:27.349 --> 02:29:27.359 align:start position:0%
and do you have any feedback as far as
 
02:29:29.270 --> 02:29:29.280 align:start position:0%
the process and how that was handled if
 
02:29:31.990 --> 02:29:32.000 align:start position:0%
it was sold specifically you know if you
 
02:29:33.750 --> 02:29:33.760 align:start position:0%
were if they were involved in your study
 
02:29:36.710 --> 02:29:36.720 align:start position:0%
i would be really curious to find out
 
02:29:38.309 --> 02:29:38.319 align:start position:0%
was there anything done in that
 
02:29:40.710 --> 02:29:40.720 align:start position:0%
particular home when it was transferring
 
02:29:40.720 --> 02:29:42.070 align:start position:0%
particular home when it was transferring
here

02:29:42.070 --> 02:29:42.080 align:start position:0%
here
 
02:29:44.389 --> 02:29:44.399 align:start position:0%
oh um
 
02:29:47.990 --> 02:29:48.000 align:start position:0%
i believe that that property owner did
 
02:29:50.950 --> 02:29:50.960 align:start position:0%
undertake a repair of the septic system
 
02:29:53.750 --> 02:29:53.760 align:start position:0%
prior to the sale of the home
 
02:29:55.349 --> 02:29:55.359 align:start position:0%
once they knew they were pretty
 
02:29:55.359 --> 02:29:57.590 align:start position:0%
once they knew they were pretty
surprised

02:29:57.590 --> 02:29:57.600 align:start position:0%
surprised
 
02:30:00.870 --> 02:30:00.880 align:start position:0%
and took steps to address it
 
02:30:02.630 --> 02:30:02.640 align:start position:0%
and that was that was our experience
 
02:30:02.640 --> 02:30:03.510 align:start position:0%
and that was that was our experience
with

02:30:03.510 --> 02:30:03.520 align:start position:0%
with
 
02:30:06.070 --> 02:30:06.080 align:start position:0%
several people they were pleased with uh
 
02:30:09.190 --> 02:30:09.200 align:start position:0%
getting financial help to do that and
 
02:30:11.990 --> 02:30:12.000 align:start position:0%
also got financial help to go ahead and
 
02:30:14.389 --> 02:30:14.399 align:start position:0%
change their um
 
02:30:16.150 --> 02:30:16.160 align:start position:0%
to address some of their issues with
 
02:30:18.150 --> 02:30:18.160 align:start position:0%
their septic system but in general i
 
02:30:20.150 --> 02:30:20.160 align:start position:0%
can't really answer your question about
 
02:30:24.230 --> 02:30:24.240 align:start position:0%
what happened after the or during a sale
 
02:30:27.429 --> 02:30:27.439 align:start position:0%
of any of the properties the data
 
02:30:29.030 --> 02:30:29.040 align:start position:0%
one quick question i'm sorry yeah for a
 
02:30:29.040 --> 02:30:30.309 align:start position:0%
one quick question i'm sorry yeah for a
follow-up

02:30:30.309 --> 02:30:30.319 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
02:30:31.990 --> 02:30:32.000 align:start position:0%
the date of that evaluation also i'm
 
02:30:33.670 --> 02:30:33.680 align:start position:0%
sorry i didn't get that when you gave
 
02:30:35.670 --> 02:30:35.680 align:start position:0%
the testimony what was the time frame
 
02:30:39.349 --> 02:30:39.359 align:start position:0%
for that evaluation you did on rocky one
 
02:30:42.870 --> 02:30:42.880 align:start position:0%
uh that was in the 2 2014 2016 time
 
02:30:42.880 --> 02:30:43.910 align:start position:0%
uh that was in the 2 2014 2016 time
frame

02:30:43.910 --> 02:30:43.920 align:start position:0%
frame

i wanted to
 
02:32:17.830 --> 02:32:17.840 align:start position:0%
point out today that
 
02:32:21.030 --> 02:32:21.040 align:start position:0%
in the bill as it's written
 
02:32:21.040 --> 02:32:22.469 align:start position:0%
in the bill as it's written
again

02:32:22.469 --> 02:32:22.479 align:start position:0%
again
 
02:32:25.030 --> 02:32:25.040 align:start position:0%
following up on chris albert's comment
 
02:32:28.070 --> 02:32:28.080 align:start position:0%
that we as licensed septic evaluators
 
02:32:31.429 --> 02:32:31.439 align:start position:0%
are not qualified to determine whether a
 
02:32:31.439 --> 02:32:32.630 align:start position:0%
are not qualified to determine whether a
system

02:32:32.630 --> 02:32:32.640 align:start position:0%
system
 
02:32:35.030 --> 02:32:35.040 align:start position:0%
is in compliance uh
 
02:32:36.950 --> 02:32:36.960 align:start position:0%
with any standard
 
02:32:39.110 --> 02:32:39.120 align:start position:0%
that's outside of our
 
02:32:41.190 --> 02:32:41.200 align:start position:0%
license purview
 
02:32:43.030 --> 02:32:43.040 align:start position:0%
we can tell you the condition of the
 
02:32:43.040 --> 02:32:44.230 align:start position:0%
we can tell you the condition of the
system

02:32:44.230 --> 02:32:44.240 align:start position:0%
system
 
02:32:45.510 --> 02:32:45.520 align:start position:0%
uh but
 
02:32:48.309 --> 02:32:48.319 align:start position:0%
as far as whether or not it complies to
 
02:32:50.150 --> 02:32:50.160 align:start position:0%
any of des
 
02:32:52.550 --> 02:32:52.560 align:start position:0%
regulations um
 
02:32:54.950 --> 02:32:54.960 align:start position:0%
we cannot do that i i would also like to
 
02:32:57.590 --> 02:32:57.600 align:start position:0%
point out too that
 
02:33:00.870 --> 02:33:00.880 align:start position:0%
site assessments and evaluations are uh
 
02:33:02.630 --> 02:33:02.640 align:start position:0%
completely different
 
02:33:04.469 --> 02:33:04.479 align:start position:0%
uh items so a
 
02:33:07.830 --> 02:33:07.840 align:start position:0%
site assessment is more of a mapping of
 
02:33:10.950 --> 02:33:10.960 align:start position:0%
septic components lot lines of butter as
 
02:33:10.960 --> 02:33:12.309 align:start position:0%
septic components lot lines of butter as
well

02:33:12.309 --> 02:33:12.319 align:start position:0%
well
 
02:33:13.990 --> 02:33:14.000 align:start position:0%
that sort of thing
 
02:33:16.550 --> 02:33:16.560 align:start position:0%
and no actual digging in the ground
 
02:33:19.429 --> 02:33:19.439 align:start position:0%
takes place during a site assessment uh
 
02:33:21.590 --> 02:33:21.600 align:start position:0%
septic evaluation
 
02:33:23.910 --> 02:33:23.920 align:start position:0%
we would actually dig up the system
 
02:33:23.920 --> 02:33:25.270 align:start position:0%
we would actually dig up the system
components

02:33:25.270 --> 02:33:25.280 align:start position:0%
components
 
02:33:27.670 --> 02:33:27.680 align:start position:0%
uh tank leachfield that sort of thing
 
02:33:29.750 --> 02:33:29.760 align:start position:0%
and actually determine what the
 
02:33:32.469 --> 02:33:32.479 align:start position:0%
condition of the system is
 
02:33:34.950 --> 02:33:34.960 align:start position:0%
uh that's it in a nutshell and i'd be
 
02:33:39.349 --> 02:33:39.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:41.190 --> 02:33:41.200 align:start position:0%
any questions by members of the
 
02:33:41.200 --> 02:33:42.389 align:start position:0%
any questions by members of the
committee

02:33:42.389 --> 02:33:42.399 align:start position:0%
committee
 
02:33:42.399 --> 02:33:43.750 align:start position:0%
committee
representative

02:33:43.750 --> 02:33:43.760 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:33:45.750 --> 02:33:45.760 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
02:33:47.910 --> 02:33:47.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question in the
 
02:33:51.030 --> 02:33:51.040 align:start position:0%
current statute section b
 
02:33:53.349 --> 02:33:53.359 align:start position:0%
it talks about soil type and you just
 
02:33:55.590 --> 02:33:55.600 align:start position:0%
made a statement saying that you don't
 
02:33:57.510 --> 02:33:57.520 align:start position:0%
actually do any digging how do we
 
02:33:59.429 --> 02:33:59.439 align:start position:0%
determine the soil type that's defined
 
02:34:00.790 --> 02:34:00.800 align:start position:0%
in section b
 
02:34:04.309 --> 02:34:04.319 align:start position:0%
without actually getting into the soil
 
02:34:05.990 --> 02:34:06.000 align:start position:0%
well that that would have to be answered
 
02:34:08.550 --> 02:34:08.560 align:start position:0%
by a licensed designer
 
02:34:12.070 --> 02:34:12.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:15.510 --> 02:34:15.520 align:start position:0%
site assessment but i i think that
 
02:34:19.590 --> 02:34:19.600 align:start position:0%
any information regarding soils would be
 
02:34:19.600 --> 02:34:20.790 align:start position:0%
any information regarding soils would be
added

02:34:20.790 --> 02:34:20.800 align:start position:0%
added
 
02:34:23.830 --> 02:34:23.840 align:start position:0%
through historical data and not actual
 
02:34:26.950 --> 02:34:26.960 align:start position:0%
digging of test fits so no no test fits
 
02:34:26.960 --> 02:34:27.910 align:start position:0%
digging of test fits so no no test fits
are

02:34:27.910 --> 02:34:27.920 align:start position:0%
are
 
02:34:30.790 --> 02:34:30.800 align:start position:0%
typically done during a site assessment
 
02:34:33.190 --> 02:34:33.200 align:start position:0%
okay thank you sergeant smith
 
02:34:35.910 --> 02:34:35.920 align:start position:0%
uh representative smith for a question
 
02:34:37.590 --> 02:34:37.600 align:start position:0%
yeah uh thank you and thank you for
 
02:34:39.429 --> 02:34:39.439 align:start position:0%
taking my question i just need a
 
02:34:43.270 --> 02:34:43.280 align:start position:0%
confirmation because i didn't quite get
 
02:34:44.870 --> 02:34:44.880 align:start position:0%
what you had said
 
02:34:47.510 --> 02:34:47.520 align:start position:0%
um i believe you said evaluators don't
 
02:34:49.270 --> 02:34:49.280 align:start position:0%
dig in the ground they just do a big
 
02:34:51.349 --> 02:34:51.359 align:start position:0%
picture kind of overview of the whole
 
02:34:51.359 --> 02:34:52.389 align:start position:0%
picture kind of overview of the whole
area

02:34:52.389 --> 02:34:52.399 align:start position:0%
area
 
02:34:54.790 --> 02:34:54.800 align:start position:0%
and then the designers do actually dig
 
02:34:57.110 --> 02:34:57.120 align:start position:0%
stuff up is that correct
 
02:34:59.830 --> 02:34:59.840 align:start position:0%
no i apologize that that's backwards so
 
02:35:03.510 --> 02:35:03.520 align:start position:0%
they the licensed designers uh do not
 
02:35:05.270 --> 02:35:05.280 align:start position:0%
actually do any digging in the ground
 
02:35:07.990 --> 02:35:08.000 align:start position:0%
it's the evaluator
 
02:35:09.830 --> 02:35:09.840 align:start position:0%
that would
 
02:35:11.750 --> 02:35:11.760 align:start position:0%
look at the system components by
 
02:35:11.760 --> 02:35:13.030 align:start position:0%
look at the system components by
physically

02:35:13.030 --> 02:35:13.040 align:start position:0%
physically
 
02:35:14.710 --> 02:35:14.720 align:start position:0%
opening up the tank and digging
 
02:35:18.469 --> 02:35:18.479 align:start position:0%
inspection holes in the leach field
 
02:35:19.910 --> 02:35:19.920 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
02:35:24.070 --> 02:35:24.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:27.750 --> 02:35:27.760 align:start position:0%
no no we see no further questions
 
02:35:30.070 --> 02:35:30.080 align:start position:0%
move on to
 
02:35:30.080 --> 02:35:31.190 align:start position:0%

new hampshire
 
02:37:02.630 --> 02:37:02.640 align:start position:0%
um after a year actually
 
02:37:04.630 --> 02:37:04.640 align:start position:0%
two years nearly of study by the
 
02:37:06.710 --> 02:37:06.720 align:start position:0%
shoreline septic system study commission
 
02:37:08.389 --> 02:37:08.399 align:start position:0%
chaired by representative spang and of
 
02:37:10.150 --> 02:37:10.160 align:start position:0%
which i was a member
 
02:37:11.990 --> 02:37:12.000 align:start position:0%
it's clear that antiquated and
 
02:37:14.070 --> 02:37:14.080 align:start position:0%
underperforming septic systems which
 
02:37:17.030 --> 02:37:17.040 align:start position:0%
treat waste from an estimated 85 percent
 
02:37:18.389 --> 02:37:18.399 align:start position:0%
of the state's
 
02:37:20.550 --> 02:37:20.560 align:start position:0%
households are a significant source of
 
02:37:22.950 --> 02:37:22.960 align:start position:0%
nitrogen and phosphorus pollution
 
02:37:25.030 --> 02:37:25.040 align:start position:0%
that negatively impact our freshwater
 
02:37:26.950 --> 02:37:26.960 align:start position:0%
lakes and coastal rivers and bays here
 
02:37:29.349 --> 02:37:29.359 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire
 
02:37:31.190 --> 02:37:31.200 align:start position:0%
in the seacoast region where i focus my
 
02:37:32.870 --> 02:37:32.880 align:start position:0%
efforts to protect and restore the
 
02:37:35.429 --> 02:37:35.439 align:start position:0%
health of great bay piscataqua estuary
 
02:37:37.590 --> 02:37:37.600 align:start position:0%
nitrogen pollution from subject systems
 
02:37:39.830 --> 02:37:39.840 align:start position:0%
is a is a quite a serious concern as as
 
02:37:42.550 --> 02:37:42.560 align:start position:0%
senator waters pointed out
 
02:37:44.790 --> 02:37:44.800 align:start position:0%
according to the 2018 state of our
 
02:37:46.790 --> 02:37:46.800 align:start position:0%
estuaries report which is a kind of a
 
02:37:49.110 --> 02:37:49.120 align:start position:0%
doctor's report relation released every
 
02:37:51.429 --> 02:37:51.439 align:start position:0%
five years uh by the pascatical region
 
02:37:53.349 --> 02:37:53.359 align:start position:0%
estuars partnership
 
02:37:55.670 --> 02:37:55.680 align:start position:0%
nearly a third of the nitrogen pollution
 
02:37:59.750 --> 02:37:59.760 align:start position:0%
from diffuse non non-point sources
 
02:38:01.590 --> 02:38:01.600 align:start position:0%
in the great asteroid comes from septic
 
02:38:01.600 --> 02:38:02.710 align:start position:0%
in the great asteroid comes from septic
systems

02:38:02.710 --> 02:38:02.720 align:start position:0%
systems
 
02:38:05.270 --> 02:38:05.280 align:start position:0%
um and and and again as senator waters
 
02:38:05.280 --> 02:38:06.150 align:start position:0%
um and and and again as senator waters
noted

02:38:06.150 --> 02:38:06.160 align:start position:0%
noted
 
02:38:08.630 --> 02:38:08.640 align:start position:0%
larger municipalities around this um
 
02:38:11.030 --> 02:38:11.040 align:start position:0%
around our our watershed have uh paid a
 
02:38:14.309 --> 02:38:14.319 align:start position:0%
lot of attention and a lot of money uh
 
02:38:17.110 --> 02:38:17.120 align:start position:0%
nearly 200 million dollars to upgrade
 
02:38:17.120 --> 02:38:18.070 align:start position:0%
nearly 200 million dollars to upgrade
um

02:38:18.070 --> 02:38:18.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:38:19.990 --> 02:38:20.000 align:start position:0%
much antiquated wastewater treatment
 
02:38:22.710 --> 02:38:22.720 align:start position:0%
facilities and has substantially
 
02:38:24.230 --> 02:38:24.240 align:start position:0%
ratcheted down the amount of nitrogen
 
02:38:26.630 --> 02:38:26.640 align:start position:0%
pollution that they discharge
 
02:38:28.469 --> 02:38:28.479 align:start position:0%
into our rivers and bays there are 18
 
02:38:30.469 --> 02:38:30.479 align:start position:0%
wastewater treatment plants um around
 
02:38:32.469 --> 02:38:32.479 align:start position:0%
this estuary
 
02:38:34.469 --> 02:38:34.479 align:start position:0%
but we've paid very little attention to
 
02:38:36.309 --> 02:38:36.319 align:start position:0%
the septic systems that treat waste from
 
02:38:38.389 --> 02:38:38.399 align:start position:0%
tens of thousands of people about half
 
02:38:41.270 --> 02:38:41.280 align:start position:0%
the population in the watershed here
 
02:38:43.030 --> 02:38:43.040 align:start position:0%
even though we know that they
 
02:38:44.710 --> 02:38:44.720 align:start position:0%
collectively contribute a very large
 
02:38:46.469 --> 02:38:46.479 align:start position:0%
share of the nitrogen load to this
 
02:38:46.479 --> 02:38:47.830 align:start position:0%
share of the nitrogen load to this
estuary

02:38:47.830 --> 02:38:47.840 align:start position:0%
estuary
 
02:38:49.750 --> 02:38:49.760 align:start position:0%
so it's really really
 
02:38:51.590 --> 02:38:51.600 align:start position:0%
high time that we turn our attention to
 
02:38:53.110 --> 02:38:53.120 align:start position:0%
how septic systems can be better
 
02:38:56.469 --> 02:38:56.479 align:start position:0%
designed cited and regulated to protect
 
02:38:58.070 --> 02:38:58.080 align:start position:0%
water quality in the health of our
 
02:39:00.070 --> 02:39:00.080 align:start position:0%
rivers and bays
 
02:39:02.150 --> 02:39:02.160 align:start position:0%
there were a lot of key findings in the
 
02:39:04.469 --> 02:39:04.479 align:start position:0%
report issued by the septic system study
 
02:39:06.150 --> 02:39:06.160 align:start position:0%
commission and i urge you to read it if
 
02:39:07.270 --> 02:39:07.280 align:start position:0%
you haven't
 
02:39:09.590 --> 02:39:09.600 align:start position:0%
it was released at the end of october in
 
02:39:09.600 --> 02:39:11.590 align:start position:0%
it was released at the end of october in
2020

02:39:11.590 --> 02:39:11.600 align:start position:0%
2020
 
02:39:15.510 --> 02:39:15.520 align:start position:0%
and uh one of the key findings is that
 
02:39:17.990 --> 02:39:18.000 align:start position:0%
you know septic systems were are a very
 
02:39:19.750 --> 02:39:19.760 align:start position:0%
effective waste on-site wastewater
 
02:39:21.750 --> 02:39:21.760 align:start position:0%
treatment system to take care of
 
02:39:24.309 --> 02:39:24.319 align:start position:0%
bacterial pollution that could otherwise
 
02:39:26.469 --> 02:39:26.479 align:start position:0%
get into our drinking water wells and
 
02:39:28.790 --> 02:39:28.800 align:start position:0%
and other receiving bodies septic
 
02:39:31.190 --> 02:39:31.200 align:start position:0%
systems are a technology that were not
 
02:39:34.070 --> 02:39:34.080 align:start position:0%
designed to never have been designed to
 
02:39:36.150 --> 02:39:36.160 align:start position:0%
mitigate nitrogen and phosphorus
 
02:39:37.910 --> 02:39:37.920 align:start position:0%
pollution the so-called you know
 
02:39:39.830 --> 02:39:39.840 align:start position:0%
nutrients that are
 
02:39:41.670 --> 02:39:41.680 align:start position:0%
present in high quantities in human
 
02:39:41.680 --> 02:39:42.630 align:start position:0%
present in high quantities in human
waste

02:39:42.630 --> 02:39:42.640 align:start position:0%
waste
 
02:39:45.190 --> 02:39:45.200 align:start position:0%
these phosphorus and nitrogen basically
 
02:39:47.750 --> 02:39:47.760 align:start position:0%
flows out of a sept out of your you know
 
02:39:50.550 --> 02:39:50.560 align:start position:0%
your home through the leech field
 
02:39:52.389 --> 02:39:52.399 align:start position:0%
very little degradation
 
02:39:55.270 --> 02:39:55.280 align:start position:0%
um and into you know groundwater
 
02:39:57.429 --> 02:39:57.439 align:start position:0%
wetlands and so on
 
02:39:57.439 --> 02:39:58.150 align:start position:0%
wetlands and so on
so

02:39:58.150 --> 02:39:58.160 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:40:01.030 --> 02:40:01.040 align:start position:0%
the systems so septic systems by
 
02:40:04.070 --> 02:40:04.080 align:start position:0%
definition add nitrogen and fertile
 
02:40:05.830 --> 02:40:05.840 align:start position:0%
nitrogen and phosphorus into our
 
02:40:07.910 --> 02:40:07.920 align:start position:0%
groundwater and water bodies whether
 
02:40:10.389 --> 02:40:10.399 align:start position:0%
they're functioning well or not and
 
02:40:12.710 --> 02:40:12.720 align:start position:0%
that's really the key the key is
 
02:40:15.030 --> 02:40:15.040 align:start position:0%
providing enough distance for that water
 
02:40:18.150 --> 02:40:18.160 align:start position:0%
to travel so that microbes and soil and
 
02:40:20.710 --> 02:40:20.720 align:start position:0%
plants can utilize those nutrients and
 
02:40:23.030 --> 02:40:23.040 align:start position:0%
take them up before they get in to our
 
02:40:25.270 --> 02:40:25.280 align:start position:0%
rivers and streams so it's not just
 
02:40:27.750 --> 02:40:27.760 align:start position:0%
about you know the failing systems are
 
02:40:31.270 --> 02:40:31.280 align:start position:0%
pretty easy to observe and the state has
 
02:40:33.910 --> 02:40:33.920 align:start position:0%
a a law that you know takes care of
 
02:40:35.830 --> 02:40:35.840 align:start position:0%
failing septic systems it's the ones
 
02:40:37.990 --> 02:40:38.000 align:start position:0%
that are either underperforming are
 
02:40:40.309 --> 02:40:40.319 align:start position:0%
poorly cited
 
02:40:43.349 --> 02:40:43.359 align:start position:0%
um that are really of key concern
 
02:40:45.990 --> 02:40:46.000 align:start position:0%
so the issue of how far these septic
 
02:40:48.389 --> 02:40:48.399 align:start position:0%
systems are located from water bodies is
 
02:40:50.070 --> 02:40:50.080 align:start position:0%
a very key consideration and an
 
02:40:53.510 --> 02:40:53.520 align:start position:0%
important element of hb 426
 
02:40:55.750 --> 02:40:55.760 align:start position:0%
another key finding of this of the
 
02:40:58.870 --> 02:40:58.880 align:start position:0%
septic system study commission is how
 
02:41:01.030 --> 02:41:01.040 align:start position:0%
widespread the lack of awareness is by
 
02:41:03.190 --> 02:41:03.200 align:start position:0%
homeowners about the condition
 
02:41:05.030 --> 02:41:05.040 align:start position:0%
maintenance needs and even the location
 
02:41:07.429 --> 02:41:07.439 align:start position:0%
of these septic systems this out of
 
02:41:09.910 --> 02:41:09.920 align:start position:0%
sight out of mind
 
02:41:12.070 --> 02:41:12.080 align:start position:0%
problem compounds the challenge of
 
02:41:14.070 --> 02:41:14.080 align:start position:0%
reducing water quality impacts from
 
02:41:15.670 --> 02:41:15.680 align:start position:0%
septic systems
 
02:41:17.750 --> 02:41:17.760 align:start position:0%
and we found that there are significant
 
02:41:20.309 --> 02:41:20.319 align:start position:0%
gaps in how the systems are regulated in
 
02:41:21.429 --> 02:41:21.439 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
02:41:23.670 --> 02:41:23.680 align:start position:0%
as i said the ones that don't contain or
 
02:41:25.750 --> 02:41:25.760 align:start position:0%
treat sewage those are fairly easy to
 
02:41:28.150 --> 02:41:28.160 align:start position:0%
notice and des requires that these
 
02:41:30.550 --> 02:41:30.560 align:start position:0%
systems be replaced but there is no
 
02:41:32.710 --> 02:41:32.720 align:start position:0%
mechanism for capturing the systems that
 
02:41:35.590 --> 02:41:35.600 align:start position:0%
are underperforming that are not cited
 
02:41:38.150 --> 02:41:38.160 align:start position:0%
properly or that are intermittently
 
02:41:40.309 --> 02:41:40.319 align:start position:0%
problematic due to changing groundwater
 
02:41:42.870 --> 02:41:42.880 align:start position:0%
levels periods of more intense use of
 
02:41:45.670 --> 02:41:45.680 align:start position:0%
the septic systems and other variables
 
02:41:47.670 --> 02:41:47.680 align:start position:0%
and another point to consider with these
 
02:41:49.590 --> 02:41:49.600 align:start position:0%
variables is that we're seeing more
 
02:41:52.389 --> 02:41:52.399 align:start position:0%
variability as we experience changing
 
02:41:54.550 --> 02:41:54.560 align:start position:0%
climate we have rising groundwater
 
02:41:54.560 --> 02:41:55.750 align:start position:0%
climate we have rising groundwater
levels

02:41:55.750 --> 02:41:55.760 align:start position:0%
levels
 
02:41:57.670 --> 02:41:57.680 align:start position:0%
especially in coastal areas where we
 
02:41:59.510 --> 02:41:59.520 align:start position:0%
have storm
 
02:42:02.309 --> 02:42:02.319 align:start position:0%
sea level rise and increased storm surge
 
02:42:03.910 --> 02:42:03.920 align:start position:0%
from the more intense
 
02:42:05.750 --> 02:42:05.760 align:start position:0%
storms that we're seeing
 
02:42:07.670 --> 02:42:07.680 align:start position:0%
in recent years
 
02:42:10.150 --> 02:42:10.160 align:start position:0%
so one of the many recommendations of
 
02:42:11.670 --> 02:42:11.680 align:start position:0%
the shoreline septic systems study
 
02:42:13.750 --> 02:42:13.760 align:start position:0%
commission which as as representative
 
02:42:16.150 --> 02:42:16.160 align:start position:0%
spain noted was approved by 10 of the 11
 
02:42:18.389 --> 02:42:18.399 align:start position:0%
voting members is to increase the
 
02:42:22.630 --> 02:42:22.640 align:start position:0%
efficacy and enforcement of rsa 485 a
 
02:42:22.640 --> 02:42:24.230 align:start position:0%
efficacy and enforcement of rsa 485 a
39

02:42:24.230 --> 02:42:24.240 align:start position:0%
39
 
02:42:27.750 --> 02:42:27.760 align:start position:0%
especially in areas with recognized
 
02:42:27.760 --> 02:42:28.710 align:start position:0%
especially in areas with recognized
state

02:42:28.710 --> 02:42:28.720 align:start position:0%
state
 
02:42:31.830 --> 02:42:31.840 align:start position:0%
designated water quality impairments
 
02:42:33.590 --> 02:42:33.600 align:start position:0%
in these zones the study commission
 
02:42:35.750 --> 02:42:35.760 align:start position:0%
represent recommends that
 
02:42:37.830 --> 02:42:37.840 align:start position:0%
both a site assessment and a septic
 
02:42:40.469 --> 02:42:40.479 align:start position:0%
system evaluation be required before a
 
02:42:43.110 --> 02:42:43.120 align:start position:0%
property is sold and transferred
 
02:42:46.150 --> 02:42:46.160 align:start position:0%
and this would enable des municipalities
 
02:42:48.230 --> 02:42:48.240 align:start position:0%
and buyers to gain important information
 
02:42:50.070 --> 02:42:50.080 align:start position:0%
about location and functionality of
 
02:42:51.349 --> 02:42:51.359 align:start position:0%
these systems
 
02:42:54.309 --> 02:42:54.319 align:start position:0%
and i know the realtors maintain that
 
02:42:56.870 --> 02:42:56.880 align:start position:0%
you know all this happens anyway because
 
02:42:59.270 --> 02:42:59.280 align:start position:0%
uh you know in the process of property
 
02:43:01.510 --> 02:43:01.520 align:start position:0%
inspection but we we learned in the
 
02:43:03.349 --> 02:43:03.359 align:start position:0%
commission that that is not the case and
 
02:43:05.110 --> 02:43:05.120 align:start position:0%
that you know we had representatives
 
02:43:07.510 --> 02:43:07.520 align:start position:0%
from the banking industry who looked at
 
02:43:09.190 --> 02:43:09.200 align:start position:0%
loan documents
 
02:43:11.590 --> 02:43:11.600 align:start position:0%
for many property transfers and did not
 
02:43:11.600 --> 02:43:12.389 align:start position:0%
for many property transfers and did not
see

02:43:12.389 --> 02:43:12.399 align:start position:0%
see
 
02:43:15.750 --> 02:43:15.760 align:start position:0%
uh septic system evaluation reports in
 
02:43:18.550 --> 02:43:18.560 align:start position:0%
many of those loan documents so you know
 
02:43:20.950 --> 02:43:20.960 align:start position:0%
maybe in some areas and by some realtors
 
02:43:22.950 --> 02:43:22.960 align:start position:0%
this is standard process but what we
 
02:43:24.469 --> 02:43:24.479 align:start position:0%
learned in the commission is that it is
 
02:43:27.590 --> 02:43:27.600 align:start position:0%
not universal and that there is this gap
 
02:43:29.270 --> 02:43:29.280 align:start position:0%
for both buyers
 
02:43:33.590 --> 02:43:33.600 align:start position:0%
municipalities and for the state agency
 
02:43:35.510 --> 02:43:35.520 align:start position:0%
so in my view
 
02:43:39.750 --> 02:43:39.760 align:start position:0%
hb 426 is a very very small step on a
 
02:43:41.590 --> 02:43:41.600 align:start position:0%
longer path that we really need to
 
02:43:42.790 --> 02:43:42.800 align:start position:0%
embark on
 
02:43:44.469 --> 02:43:44.479 align:start position:0%
toward more effective regulation of
 
02:43:46.309 --> 02:43:46.319 align:start position:0%
septic systems that will better protect
 
02:43:48.550 --> 02:43:48.560 align:start position:0%
the state's precious water resources
 
02:43:50.630 --> 02:43:50.640 align:start position:0%
from the threats of nutrient pollution
 
02:43:52.870 --> 02:43:52.880 align:start position:0%
and i urge this measure
 
02:43:54.230 --> 02:43:54.240 align:start position:0%
ought to pass
 
02:43:55.429 --> 02:43:55.439 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your time and
 
02:43:58.150 --> 02:43:58.160 align:start position:0%
i'd be happy to answer questions
 
02:44:00.309 --> 02:44:00.319 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony
 
02:44:03.590 --> 02:44:03.600 align:start position:0%
any senior questions no question see no
 
02:44:05.030 --> 02:44:05.040 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much for your
 
02:44:07.990 --> 02:44:08.000 align:start position:0%
testimony you're welcome uh
 
02:44:11.030 --> 02:44:11.040 align:start position:0%
is malloy or uh the
 
02:44:13.110 --> 02:44:13.120 align:start position:0%
final chance
 
02:44:16.230 --> 02:44:16.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:18.790 --> 02:44:18.800 align:start position:0%
i do not
 
02:44:21.510 --> 02:44:21.520 align:start position:0%
is there anyone from the audience who uh
 
02:44:25.269 --> 02:44:25.279 align:start position:0%
wishes to testify who has not signed up
 
02:44:27.510 --> 02:44:27.520 align:start position:0%
or anyone that i've missed
 
02:44:29.750 --> 02:44:29.760 align:start position:0%
i'm sure we've got one hand raised
 
02:44:29.760 --> 02:44:30.830 align:start position:0%
i'm sure we've got one hand raised
who's

02:44:30.830 --> 02:44:30.840 align:start position:0%
who's
 
02:44:33.910 --> 02:44:33.920 align:start position:0%
that is uh gary abbott
 
02:44:39.830 --> 02:44:39.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:41.030 --> 02:44:41.040 align:start position:0%
are you
 
02:44:41.040 --> 02:44:42.150 align:start position:0%
are you
there

02:44:42.150 --> 02:44:42.160 align:start position:0%
there
 
02:44:45.429 --> 02:44:45.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:47.670 --> 02:44:47.680 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman renzullo committee
 
02:44:49.750 --> 02:44:49.760 align:start position:0%
members for the record again my name is
 
02:44:51.110 --> 02:44:51.120 align:start position:0%
gary abbott i'm
 
02:44:52.870 --> 02:44:52.880 align:start position:0%
the executive vice president of the
 
02:44:54.790 --> 02:44:54.800 align:start position:0%
associated general contractors of new
 
02:44:57.269 --> 02:44:57.279 align:start position:0%
hampshire i just want to bring forward a
 
02:44:59.429 --> 02:44:59.439 align:start position:0%
couple of concerns uh
 
02:45:01.990 --> 02:45:02.000 align:start position:0%
i presented this bill before both my
 
02:45:03.910 --> 02:45:03.920 align:start position:0%
legislative committee and my board of
 
02:45:03.920 --> 02:45:05.510 align:start position:0%
legislative committee and my board of
directors

02:45:05.510 --> 02:45:05.520 align:start position:0%
directors
 
02:45:07.190 --> 02:45:07.200 align:start position:0%
they really had two
 
02:45:08.710 --> 02:45:08.720 align:start position:0%
two issues and i think they were
 
02:45:10.630 --> 02:45:10.640 align:start position:0%
somewhat brought up by the realtors but
 
02:45:12.389 --> 02:45:12.399 align:start position:0%
i just want to go over them
 
02:45:15.269 --> 02:45:15.279 align:start position:0%
the first one was the expansion from 200
 
02:45:17.269 --> 02:45:17.279 align:start position:0%
feet to 250
 
02:45:19.510 --> 02:45:19.520 align:start position:0%
on line five
 
02:45:21.510 --> 02:45:21.520 align:start position:0%
we believe it will encompass a lot more
 
02:45:21.520 --> 02:45:22.950 align:start position:0%
we believe it will encompass a lot more
properties

02:45:22.950 --> 02:45:22.960 align:start position:0%
properties
 
02:45:25.030 --> 02:45:25.040 align:start position:0%
we do believe the shoreline protection
 
02:45:27.670 --> 02:45:27.680 align:start position:0%
regulations are slightly different than
 
02:45:29.830 --> 02:45:29.840 align:start position:0%
septic regulations
 
02:45:31.670 --> 02:45:31.680 align:start position:0%
just so the committee knows you can
 
02:45:34.150 --> 02:45:34.160 align:start position:0%
place a septic system
 
02:45:38.469 --> 02:45:38.479 align:start position:0%
a standard system 75 feet from your well
 
02:45:42.630 --> 02:45:42.640 align:start position:0%
and so the expansion of from 200 to 250
 
02:45:45.030 --> 02:45:45.040 align:start position:0%
or any property in that zone could
 
02:45:47.110 --> 02:45:47.120 align:start position:0%
encumber a lot more properties that are
 
02:45:49.910 --> 02:45:49.920 align:start position:0%
currently not under this regulation
 
02:45:51.910 --> 02:45:51.920 align:start position:0%
that probably don't need to be under
 
02:45:51.920 --> 02:45:52.950 align:start position:0%
that probably don't need to be under
this

02:45:52.950 --> 02:45:52.960 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:45:55.590 --> 02:45:55.600 align:start position:0%
the second point that the my committees
 
02:45:58.469 --> 02:45:58.479 align:start position:0%
raised was line 24.
 
02:45:58.479 --> 02:45:59.510 align:start position:0%
raised was line 24.
um

02:45:59.510 --> 02:45:59.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:46:01.670 --> 02:46:01.680 align:start position:0%
we're fully in support of protecting our
 
02:46:04.230 --> 02:46:04.240 align:start position:0%
environment protecting our waterways and
 
02:46:06.550 --> 02:46:06.560 align:start position:0%
our lakes and rivers
 
02:46:09.990 --> 02:46:10.000 align:start position:0%
but line 24 compliance with the current
 
02:46:12.150 --> 02:46:12.160 align:start position:0%
department requirements it really
 
02:46:13.429 --> 02:46:13.439 align:start position:0%
doesn't say
 
02:46:15.190 --> 02:46:15.200 align:start position:0%
failed system
 
02:46:17.750 --> 02:46:17.760 align:start position:0%
uh it it leaves the door open for a lot
 
02:46:17.760 --> 02:46:18.349 align:start position:0%
uh it it leaves the door open for a lot
of

02:46:18.349 --> 02:46:18.359 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:46:18.359 --> 02:46:19.990 align:start position:0%
of
interpretation

02:46:19.990 --> 02:46:20.000 align:start position:0%
interpretation
 
02:46:22.550 --> 02:46:22.560 align:start position:0%
and conflict as to what the current
 
02:46:25.910 --> 02:46:25.920 align:start position:0%
regulations are and whether the success
 
02:46:27.190 --> 02:46:27.200 align:start position:0%
the system
 
02:46:29.349 --> 02:46:29.359 align:start position:0%
is functioning properly even though it's
 
02:46:32.870 --> 02:46:32.880 align:start position:0%
an older system so it does open the door
 
02:46:35.750 --> 02:46:35.760 align:start position:0%
um the the last point i think in general
 
02:46:38.550 --> 02:46:38.560 align:start position:0%
was is and i don't have the answer to
 
02:46:41.670 --> 02:46:41.680 align:start position:0%
this it's just
 
02:46:43.510 --> 02:46:43.520 align:start position:0%
you hate to put in regulations that
 
02:46:45.670 --> 02:46:45.680 align:start position:0%
encumbers a lot of properties and a lot
 
02:46:47.190 --> 02:46:47.200 align:start position:0%
of regulations
 
02:46:50.870 --> 02:46:50.880 align:start position:0%
uh for those few that are in the
 
02:46:52.950 --> 02:46:52.960 align:start position:0%
polluting category and i think that was
 
02:46:55.269 --> 02:46:55.279 align:start position:0%
a concern of whether we have any kind of
 
02:46:58.150 --> 02:46:58.160 align:start position:0%
des environmental need assessment you
 
02:47:00.469 --> 02:47:00.479 align:start position:0%
may have that but it was just a question
 
02:47:03.110 --> 02:47:03.120 align:start position:0%
i feel that from my board of directors
 
02:47:04.790 --> 02:47:04.800 align:start position:0%
that that would be helpful but we do
 
02:47:06.950 --> 02:47:06.960 align:start position:0%
have two concerns that uh
 
02:47:09.030 --> 02:47:09.040 align:start position:0%
ask that the committee not support the
 
02:47:12.150 --> 02:47:12.160 align:start position:0%
bill if they move to the 250 feet or
 
02:47:15.830 --> 02:47:15.840 align:start position:0%
clarify uh line 24. so with that i end
 
02:47:17.990 --> 02:47:18.000 align:start position:0%

thank you uh sorry about that uh thank
 
02:48:19.030 --> 02:48:19.040 align:start position:0%
you mr chairman members of the committee
 
02:48:21.349 --> 02:48:21.359 align:start position:0%
uh for the record i am rob tardif i'm
 
02:48:22.870 --> 02:48:22.880 align:start position:0%
the administrator of the subsurface
 
02:48:24.630 --> 02:48:24.640 align:start position:0%
systems program within the department of
 
02:48:26.550 --> 02:48:26.560 align:start position:0%
environmental services
 
02:48:27.910 --> 02:48:27.920 align:start position:0%
uh for those who don't know the
 
02:48:30.070 --> 02:48:30.080 align:start position:0%
subsurface systems bureau regulates all
 
02:48:32.870 --> 02:48:32.880 align:start position:0%
on-site wastewater systems or septic
 
02:48:32.880 --> 02:48:34.950 align:start position:0%
on-site wastewater systems or septic
systems

02:48:34.950 --> 02:48:34.960 align:start position:0%
systems
 
02:48:37.110 --> 02:48:37.120 align:start position:0%
and i along with steve kutcher were
 
02:48:39.670 --> 02:48:39.680 align:start position:0%
representing the department
 
02:48:42.550 --> 02:48:42.560 align:start position:0%
on the shoreline septic study commission
 
02:48:44.870 --> 02:48:44.880 align:start position:0%
that recently produced the the report
 
02:48:47.349 --> 02:48:47.359 align:start position:0%
that was referenced earlier
 
02:48:50.070 --> 02:48:50.080 align:start position:0%
uh the department has some suggestions
 
02:48:52.389 --> 02:48:52.399 align:start position:0%
on the proposed language and the bill
 
02:48:54.150 --> 02:48:54.160 align:start position:0%
and i believe i could be relatively
 
02:48:54.160 --> 02:48:56.710 align:start position:0%
and i believe i could be relatively
brief

02:48:56.710 --> 02:48:56.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:58.950 --> 02:48:58.960 align:start position:0%
because we we essentially concur with
 
02:49:01.110 --> 02:49:01.120 align:start position:0%
with uh the testimony of chris albert
 
02:49:02.950 --> 02:49:02.960 align:start position:0%
and pete russell
 
02:49:05.990 --> 02:49:06.000 align:start position:0%
um we believe that in
 
02:49:09.110 --> 02:49:09.120 align:start position:0%
uh roman five uh section d of the
 
02:49:12.710 --> 02:49:12.720 align:start position:0%
proposal that the the language regarding
 
02:49:14.630 --> 02:49:14.640 align:start position:0%
that the
 
02:49:17.190 --> 02:49:17.200 align:start position:0%
uh the determination be made that the
 
02:49:18.950 --> 02:49:18.960 align:start position:0%
system is in compliance with all current
 
02:49:20.389 --> 02:49:20.399 align:start position:0%
department requirements could be
 
02:49:23.269 --> 02:49:23.279 align:start position:0%
stricken uh
 
02:49:24.950 --> 02:49:24.960 align:start position:0%
literally all of the requirements may
 
02:49:27.670 --> 02:49:27.680 align:start position:0%
not be applicable to do a
 
02:49:31.269 --> 02:49:31.279 align:start position:0%
valid septic system of uh evaluation
 
02:49:34.070 --> 02:49:34.080 align:start position:0%
uh for instance uh mr mahler's reference
 
02:49:36.950 --> 02:49:36.960 align:start position:0%
to septic tanks you know that that may
 
02:49:39.590 --> 02:49:39.600 align:start position:0%
not be all that necessary or applicable
 
02:49:41.590 --> 02:49:41.600 align:start position:0%
to determining whether or not a system
 
02:49:43.670 --> 02:49:43.680 align:start position:0%
is actually polluting
 
02:49:46.150 --> 02:49:46.160 align:start position:0%
the groundwater the ground surface or
 
02:49:49.590 --> 02:49:49.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:53.590 --> 02:49:53.600 align:start position:0%
in addition uh regarding the
 
02:49:57.510 --> 02:49:57.520 align:start position:0%
the septic system evaluators as both um
 
02:50:00.150 --> 02:50:00.160 align:start position:0%
chris albert and pete russell stated
 
02:50:00.160 --> 02:50:01.110 align:start position:0%
chris albert and pete russell stated
uh

02:50:01.110 --> 02:50:01.120 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:50:03.110 --> 02:50:03.120 align:start position:0%
for their license they don't necessarily
 
02:50:05.110 --> 02:50:05.120 align:start position:0%
have the knowledge
 
02:50:06.950 --> 02:50:06.960 align:start position:0%
necessary to
 
02:50:08.870 --> 02:50:08.880 align:start position:0%
to determine whether or not a system is
 
02:50:08.880 --> 02:50:09.590 align:start position:0%
to determine whether or not a system is
in

02:50:09.590 --> 02:50:09.600 align:start position:0%
in
 
02:50:10.950 --> 02:50:10.960 align:start position:0%
the seasonal high water table or the
 
02:50:13.349 --> 02:50:13.359 align:start position:0%
water table
 
02:50:15.750 --> 02:50:15.760 align:start position:0%
and they also don't have the ability to
 
02:50:18.070 --> 02:50:18.080 align:start position:0%
formally deem a system to be in failure
 
02:50:19.990 --> 02:50:20.000 align:start position:0%
for the purposes of the department of
 
02:50:21.670 --> 02:50:21.680 align:start position:0%
environmental services
 
02:50:25.269 --> 02:50:25.279 align:start position:0%
so we recommend also as they did
 
02:50:27.990 --> 02:50:28.000 align:start position:0%
to strike evaluators
 
02:50:29.269 --> 02:50:29.279 align:start position:0%
from the
 
02:50:31.349 --> 02:50:31.359 align:start position:0%
proposed language
 
02:50:32.950 --> 02:50:32.960 align:start position:0%
and finally in
 
02:50:35.510 --> 02:50:35.520 align:start position:0%
the existing language in
 
02:50:38.630 --> 02:50:38.640 align:start position:0%
45 8 39 roman 8
 
02:50:41.429 --> 02:50:41.439 align:start position:0%
we are suggesting to amend that language
 
02:50:42.790 --> 02:50:42.800 align:start position:0%
to say
 
02:50:45.670 --> 02:50:45.680 align:start position:0%
that if during the evaluation
 
02:50:47.670 --> 02:50:47.680 align:start position:0%
uh or the excite assessment and an
 
02:50:51.349 --> 02:50:51.359 align:start position:0%
evaluation is required
 
02:50:51.359 --> 02:50:52.150 align:start position:0%
evaluation is required
that

02:50:52.150 --> 02:50:52.160 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:50:54.469 --> 02:50:54.479 align:start position:0%
only if the system is deemed to be in
 
02:50:54.479 --> 02:50:55.750 align:start position:0%
only if the system is deemed to be in
failure

02:50:55.750 --> 02:50:55.760 align:start position:0%
failure
 
02:50:57.830 --> 02:50:57.840 align:start position:0%
that the department or the town the
 
02:51:00.150 --> 02:51:00.160 align:start position:0%
municipality be notified
 
02:51:00.160 --> 02:51:01.349 align:start position:0%
municipality be notified
and

02:51:01.349 --> 02:51:01.359 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:51:03.590 --> 02:51:03.600 align:start position:0%
the that notification as far as the
 
02:51:08.070 --> 02:51:08.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:09.830 --> 02:51:09.840 align:start position:0%
the application that we would assume
 
02:51:12.550 --> 02:51:12.560 align:start position:0%
would be submitted to us to repair that
 
02:51:13.830 --> 02:51:13.840 align:start position:0%
that uh
 
02:51:15.750 --> 02:51:15.760 align:start position:0%
that failed system
 
02:51:15.760 --> 02:51:16.790 align:start position:0%
that failed system
uh

02:51:16.790 --> 02:51:16.800 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:51:19.670 --> 02:51:19.680 align:start position:0%
there were there were comments regarding
 
02:51:21.269 --> 02:51:21.279 align:start position:0%
fiscal impacts
 
02:51:22.790 --> 02:51:22.800 align:start position:0%
uh if it was
 
02:51:24.150 --> 02:51:24.160 align:start position:0%
if the
 
02:51:25.750 --> 02:51:25.760 align:start position:0%
documentation was provided to the
 
02:51:27.910 --> 02:51:27.920 align:start position:0%
department as part of an application
 
02:51:29.110 --> 02:51:29.120 align:start position:0%
that could be
 
02:51:31.830 --> 02:51:31.840 align:start position:0%
uh included in our current e-permitting
 
02:51:31.840 --> 02:51:33.429 align:start position:0%
uh included in our current e-permitting
database

02:51:33.429 --> 02:51:33.439 align:start position:0%
database
 
02:51:35.349 --> 02:51:35.359 align:start position:0%
so there would be
 
02:51:37.429 --> 02:51:37.439 align:start position:0%
no additional fiscal impact to the
 
02:51:37.439 --> 02:51:39.670 align:start position:0%
no additional fiscal impact to the
department

02:51:39.670 --> 02:51:39.680 align:start position:0%
department
 
02:51:41.830 --> 02:51:41.840 align:start position:0%
if we were to have to
 
02:51:45.110 --> 02:51:45.120 align:start position:0%
receive all evaluations as
 
02:51:49.269 --> 02:51:49.279 align:start position:0%
the existing language currently states
 
02:51:51.510 --> 02:51:51.520 align:start position:0%
there could be somewhat of an uh fiscal
 
02:51:54.790 --> 02:51:54.800 align:start position:0%
impact we would have to determine who
 
02:51:56.950 --> 02:51:56.960 align:start position:0%
would receive and review these all of
 
02:51:59.429 --> 02:51:59.439 align:start position:0%
these evaluations and
 
02:52:01.349 --> 02:52:01.359 align:start position:0%
what we would end up doing with those
 
02:52:03.750 --> 02:52:03.760 align:start position:0%
evaluations because it's been has been
 
02:52:05.910 --> 02:52:05.920 align:start position:0%
stated we currently don't receive those
 
02:52:08.469 --> 02:52:08.479 align:start position:0%
evaluations so we would have to find
 
02:52:11.110 --> 02:52:11.120 align:start position:0%
some way to manage them if in fact all
 
02:52:13.349 --> 02:52:13.359 align:start position:0%
of the evaluations were to be submitted
 
02:52:15.429 --> 02:52:15.439 align:start position:0%
to the department
 
02:52:18.870 --> 02:52:18.880 align:start position:0%
again uh trying to stay brief uh that's
 
02:52:20.950 --> 02:52:20.960 align:start position:0%
about all we have and i'd do my best to
 
02:52:24.309 --> 02:52:24.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:26.550 --> 02:52:26.560 align:start position:0%
any uh any questions by members of the
 
02:52:29.030 --> 02:52:29.040 align:start position:0%
committee sure singing questions okay
 
02:52:31.349 --> 02:52:31.359 align:start position:0%
no questions uh just one
 
02:52:34.790 --> 02:52:34.800 align:start position:0%
one comment from the chair uh
 
02:52:37.910 --> 02:52:37.920 align:start position:0%
you did there there was a memo sent to
 
02:52:39.750 --> 02:52:39.760 align:start position:0%
the committee from
 
02:52:43.030 --> 02:52:43.040 align:start position:0%
the des but you hadn't signed you hadn't
 
02:52:45.190 --> 02:52:45.200 align:start position:0%
signed up to speak and
 
02:52:47.429 --> 02:52:47.439 align:start position:0%
it would be helpful if i had known that
 
02:52:48.790 --> 02:52:48.800 align:start position:0%
you were there i would have gotten you
 
02:52:52.309 --> 02:52:52.319 align:start position:0%
up earlier to get information uh you
 
02:52:54.469 --> 02:52:54.479 align:start position:0%
know before the committee
 
02:52:56.870 --> 02:52:56.880 align:start position:0%
uh i'm sorry about that i was i was
 
02:52:59.030 --> 02:52:59.040 align:start position:0%
under the impression that um
 
02:53:01.830 --> 02:53:01.840 align:start position:0%
you were sent a notification that i
 
02:53:04.550 --> 02:53:04.560 align:start position:0%
would be speaking to this so oh yeah
 
02:53:04.560 --> 02:53:05.750 align:start position:0%
would be speaking to this so oh yeah
uh

02:53:05.750 --> 02:53:05.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:53:08.230 --> 02:53:08.240 align:start position:0%
it could possibly have been it isn't it
 
02:53:11.830 --> 02:53:11.840 align:start position:0%
wasn't in the uh the printout system for
 
02:53:11.840 --> 02:53:12.630 align:start position:0%
wasn't in the uh the printout system for
uh

02:53:12.630 --> 02:53:12.640 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:53:14.790 --> 02:53:14.800 align:start position:0%
people's speaking
 
02:53:16.469 --> 02:53:16.479 align:start position:0%
forget i apologize for that but what i
 
02:53:19.670 --> 02:53:19.680 align:start position:0%
can do is check with
 
02:53:23.190 --> 02:53:23.200 align:start position:0%
the commissioner's office on on how that
 
02:53:26.070 --> 02:53:26.080 align:start position:0%
that process is uh is
 
02:53:28.550 --> 02:53:28.560 align:start position:0%
being handled so any future
 
02:53:30.790 --> 02:53:30.800 align:start position:0%
testimonies from the department uh
 
02:53:32.790 --> 02:53:32.800 align:start position:0%
proper notification is made
 
02:53:34.550 --> 02:53:34.560 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you
 
02:53:34.560 --> 02:53:36.630 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you
okay

and uh let's see
 
03:03:43.429 --> 03:03:43.439 align:start position:0%

hand to raise after they're done
 
03:03:59.269 --> 03:03:59.279 align:start position:0%
speaking there's a delay so often it
 
03:04:00.950 --> 03:04:00.960 align:start position:0%
gets moved on
 
03:04:00.960 --> 03:04:01.910 align:start position:0%

um
before

03:04:03.190 --> 03:04:03.200 align:start position:0%
before
 
03:04:05.590 --> 03:04:05.600 align:start position:0%
my hand comes up so i just wondered if
 
03:04:07.030 --> 03:04:07.040 align:start position:0%
we could
 
03:04:09.750 --> 03:04:09.760 align:start position:0%
pause just a little bit longer
 
03:04:14.710 --> 03:04:14.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:17.510 --> 03:04:17.520 align:start position:0%
after asking questions or
 
03:04:19.830 --> 03:04:19.840 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry after the testimony is given
 
03:04:23.269 --> 03:04:23.279 align:start position:0%
and you asked if there's any questions
 
03:04:25.990 --> 03:04:26.000 align:start position:0%
um just a pause to give people a chance
 
03:04:28.550 --> 03:04:28.560 align:start position:0%
to hit their unmute button
 
03:04:31.510 --> 03:04:31.520 align:start position:0%
um and and raise their hand
 
03:04:31.520 --> 03:04:34.150 align:start position:0%
um and and raise their hand
okay

03:04:34.150 --> 03:04:34.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:36.230 --> 03:04:36.240 align:start position:0%
is there is that the process they have
 
03:04:38.790 --> 03:04:38.800 align:start position:0%
to unmute themselves they just have to
 
03:04:40.950 --> 03:04:40.960 align:start position:0%
raise their hands but there is
 
03:04:43.030 --> 03:04:43.040 align:start position:0%
once they punch the button there's a 10
 
03:04:45.670 --> 03:04:45.680 align:start position:0%
to 15 second delay oh okay
 
03:04:47.110 --> 03:04:47.120 align:start position:0%
when they punch the bike and when it
 
03:04:49.269 --> 03:04:49.279 align:start position:0%

of the committee

um i was asked to present house bill 447
 
03:58:40.790 --> 03:58:40.800 align:start position:0%
by a constituent i had filed a testimony
 
03:58:43.269 --> 03:58:43.279 align:start position:0%
previously with the committee
 
03:58:47.030 --> 03:58:47.040 align:start position:0%
um her husband was lost and never found
 
03:58:49.510 --> 03:58:49.520 align:start position:0%
deep sea diving in the caribbean
 
03:58:52.389 --> 03:58:52.399 align:start position:0%
she advised me that he had rented scuba
 
03:58:55.110 --> 03:58:55.120 align:start position:0%
deer when he was there but he did not
 
03:58:59.110 --> 03:58:59.120 align:start position:0%
rent did not have with him his gps
 
03:59:03.030 --> 03:59:03.040 align:start position:0%
um she believes that with the gps we she
 
03:59:04.950 --> 03:59:04.960 align:start position:0%
could have at least found his body had
 
03:59:07.670 --> 03:59:07.680 align:start position:0%
some closure if he was in distress he
 
03:59:09.590 --> 03:59:09.600 align:start position:0%
could have asked for help
 
03:59:11.349 --> 03:59:11.359 align:start position:0%
they never found them and to my
 
03:59:13.429 --> 03:59:13.439 align:start position:0%
knowledge to this day he still hasn't
 
03:59:14.870 --> 03:59:14.880 align:start position:0%
been found
 
03:59:17.110 --> 03:59:17.120 align:start position:0%
i will tell you i can't answer too many
 
03:59:19.670 --> 03:59:19.680 align:start position:0%
of your questions about scuba diving the
 
03:59:22.389 --> 03:59:22.399 align:start position:0%
first and only time i ever scuba dived
 
03:59:25.189 --> 03:59:25.199 align:start position:0%
was on my honeymoon in the caribbean in
 
03:59:26.550 --> 03:59:26.560 align:start position:0%
a swimming pool
 
03:59:29.189 --> 03:59:29.199 align:start position:0%
but my wife liked it so much she became
 
03:59:31.990 --> 03:59:32.000 align:start position:0%
a diver and gutter paddy license uh
 
03:59:35.510 --> 03:59:35.520 align:start position:0%
diving off the coast of uh portsmouth
 
03:59:41.349 --> 03:59:41.359 align:start position:0%
um so i i filed this bill to try to be
 
03:59:44.389 --> 03:59:44.399 align:start position:0%
to make it safer for divers i didn't
 
03:59:47.110 --> 03:59:47.120 align:start position:0%
require in the bill that the
 
03:59:49.110 --> 03:59:49.120 align:start position:0%
rental place
 
03:59:51.910 --> 03:59:51.920 align:start position:0%
has to rent it to them i didn't require
 
03:59:54.309 --> 03:59:54.319 align:start position:0%
they had to rent it if you were a diver
 
03:59:57.590 --> 03:59:57.600 align:start position:0%
simply that they can offer it for rent
 
03:59:59.510 --> 03:59:59.520 align:start position:0%
that it's there that if they're leasing
 
04:00:02.630 --> 04:00:02.640 align:start position:0%
and renting the tanks and the other gear
 
04:00:04.710 --> 04:00:04.720 align:start position:0%
they offer for lease
 
04:00:09.189 --> 04:00:09.199 align:start position:0%
uh uh underwater gps i know gps
 
04:00:11.990 --> 04:00:12.000 align:start position:0%
underwater isn't the best technology at
 
04:00:13.510 --> 04:00:13.520 align:start position:0%
this point
 
04:00:16.309 --> 04:00:16.319 align:start position:0%
but i thought anything that could help
 
04:00:18.790 --> 04:00:18.800 align:start position:0%
the safety of the diver would be worth
 
04:00:22.070 --> 04:00:22.080 align:start position:0%
filing i did talk to the local dive shop
 
04:00:22.080 --> 04:00:22.870 align:start position:0%
filing i did talk to the local dive shop
in

04:00:22.870 --> 04:00:22.880 align:start position:0%
in
 
04:00:24.550 --> 04:00:24.560 align:start position:0%
one of the towns that i represent
 
04:00:27.750 --> 04:00:27.760 align:start position:0%
atkinson new hampshire um kind of funny
 
04:00:28.870 --> 04:00:28.880 align:start position:0%
because it's
 
04:00:31.590 --> 04:00:31.600 align:start position:0%
i represent plasto and plaistow has no
 
04:00:34.389 --> 04:00:34.399 align:start position:0%
standing body of water so there's no
 
04:00:36.710 --> 04:00:36.720 align:start position:0%
chance to dive in place though since
 
04:00:38.469 --> 04:00:38.479 align:start position:0%
there's no water
 
04:00:40.150 --> 04:00:40.160 align:start position:0%
it's one of the two towns in the state
 
04:00:42.150 --> 04:00:42.160 align:start position:0%
that doesn't have a standing body of
 
04:00:42.160 --> 04:00:43.429 align:start position:0%
that doesn't have a standing body of
water

04:00:43.429 --> 04:00:43.439 align:start position:0%
water
 
04:00:46.389 --> 04:00:46.399 align:start position:0%
but next door in atkinson there's a dive
 
04:00:48.469 --> 04:00:48.479 align:start position:0%
shop the dive shop
 
04:00:50.790 --> 04:00:50.800 align:start position:0%
was not against it he thought anything
 
04:00:53.429 --> 04:00:53.439 align:start position:0%
he can do to help safety of divers would
 
04:00:55.110 --> 04:00:55.120 align:start position:0%
be recommended
 
04:00:57.110 --> 04:00:57.120 align:start position:0%
after i filed the bill it was brought to
 
04:00:59.510 --> 04:00:59.520 align:start position:0%
my attention and reviewing it that some
 
04:01:01.510 --> 04:01:01.520 align:start position:0%
of the penalty provisions
 
04:01:01.520 --> 04:01:02.309 align:start position:0%
of the penalty provisions
um

04:01:02.309 --> 04:01:02.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:01:04.870 --> 04:01:04.880 align:start position:0%
probably were not
 
04:01:06.950 --> 04:01:06.960 align:start position:0%
or shouldn't have been set forth therein
 
04:01:09.990 --> 04:01:10.000 align:start position:0%
because they mentioned dates of 1973.
 
04:01:13.269 --> 04:01:13.279 align:start position:0%
so i asked uh ols to prepare an
 
04:01:15.429 --> 04:01:15.439 align:start position:0%
amendment i had filed that amendment
 
04:01:18.429 --> 04:01:18.439 align:start position:0%
with the committee and that's amendment
 
04:01:22.469 --> 04:01:22.479 align:start position:0%
0022 small h
 
04:01:24.710 --> 04:01:24.720 align:start position:0%
so basically that's the story of this
 
04:01:27.349 --> 04:01:27.359 align:start position:0%
bill i just would like to improve safety
 
04:01:29.030 --> 04:01:29.040 align:start position:0%
of divers diving
 
04:01:31.910 --> 04:01:31.920 align:start position:0%
wherever they're in a lake uh or in the
 
04:01:31.920 --> 04:01:33.429 align:start position:0%
wherever they're in a lake uh or in the
ocean

04:01:33.429 --> 04:01:33.439 align:start position:0%
ocean
 
04:01:36.630 --> 04:01:36.640 align:start position:0%
who rent equipment in new hampshire
 
04:01:38.950 --> 04:01:38.960 align:start position:0%
and that's the bill and i would hope
 
04:01:41.189 --> 04:01:41.199 align:start position:0%
that at the end of the presentation and
 
04:01:43.590 --> 04:01:43.600 align:start position:0%
any other speakers you might have that
 
04:01:45.189 --> 04:01:45.199 align:start position:0%
you would consider
 
04:01:47.990 --> 04:01:48.000 align:start position:0%
ought to pass as amended
 
04:01:50.710 --> 04:01:50.720 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman that ends my
 
04:01:50.720 --> 04:01:53.990 align:start position:0%

04:01:54.790 --> 04:01:54.800 align:start position:0%
a
 
04:01:57.269 --> 04:01:57.279 align:start position:0%
question about a
 
04:01:59.830 --> 04:01:59.840 align:start position:0%
question by representative gunski thank

04:02:03.189 --> 04:02:03.199 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for taking my
 
04:02:06.150 --> 04:02:06.160 align:start position:0%
question uh are you aware or have you
 
04:02:09.510 --> 04:02:09.520 align:start position:0%
looked into section 27 or 270 chapter
 
04:02:11.830 --> 04:02:11.840 align:start position:0%
270 section 31
 
04:02:14.070 --> 04:02:14.080 align:start position:0%
that talks about a diverse flag his
 
04:02:15.750 --> 04:02:15.760 align:start position:0%
vegan statue
 
04:02:17.990 --> 04:02:18.000 align:start position:0%
and that any person engaged in scuba
 
04:02:20.309 --> 04:02:20.319 align:start position:0%
diving and snorkeling shall remain 75
 
04:02:23.429 --> 04:02:23.439 align:start position:0%
feet or within 75 feet of that flat
 
04:02:28.070 --> 04:02:28.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:30.710 --> 04:02:30.720 align:start position:0%
wasn't aware of the flagging requirement
 
04:02:33.750 --> 04:02:33.760 align:start position:0%
and i'm not sure that would help if the
 
04:02:36.870 --> 04:02:36.880 align:start position:0%
diver is off the coast of the ocean or
 
04:02:39.910 --> 04:02:39.920 align:start position:0%
in a deep lake uh say winnipesaukee
 
04:02:41.830 --> 04:02:41.840 align:start position:0%
someplace in the middle of the lake and
 
04:02:44.309 --> 04:02:44.319 align:start position:0%
he and he goes someplace or he gets
 
04:02:46.469 --> 04:02:46.479 align:start position:0%
caught in distress
 
04:02:46.479 --> 04:02:47.429 align:start position:0%
caught in distress
the

04:02:47.429 --> 04:02:47.439 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:02:51.189 --> 04:02:51.199 align:start position:0%
purpose of this of the proposed bill 447
 
04:02:53.990 --> 04:02:54.000 align:start position:0%
is to help the driver the diver not only
 
04:02:55.030 --> 04:02:55.040 align:start position:0%
if he's
 
04:02:59.590 --> 04:02:59.600 align:start position:0%
uh lost or i hate to say deceased but if
 
04:03:03.110 --> 04:03:03.120 align:start position:0%

yes thank you for taking my question

04:03:16.870 --> 04:03:16.880 align:start position:0%
get the information on that
 
04:03:19.590 --> 04:03:19.600 align:start position:0%
the amendment strikes
 
04:03:19.600 --> 04:03:22.070 align:start position:0%
the amendment strikes
article

04:03:22.070 --> 04:03:22.080 align:start position:0%
article
 
04:03:24.309 --> 04:03:24.319 align:start position:0%
roman numeral one and two that says if
 
04:03:26.469 --> 04:03:26.479 align:start position:0%
the offense occurred prided of number
 
04:03:26.479 --> 04:03:27.630 align:start position:0%
the offense occurred prided of number
first

04:03:27.630 --> 04:03:27.640 align:start position:0%
first
 
04:03:30.550 --> 04:03:30.560 align:start position:0%
1973 there is a fine if the offense
 
04:03:34.150 --> 04:03:34.160 align:start position:0%
occurs on or after november 1st 1973
 
04:03:36.070 --> 04:03:36.080 align:start position:0%
it's a violation so they took out the
 
04:03:40.309 --> 04:03:40.319 align:start position:0%
dates of november 1973 so it simply
 
04:03:40.319 --> 04:03:41.670 align:start position:0%
dates of november 1973 so it simply
reads

04:03:41.670 --> 04:03:41.680 align:start position:0%
reads
 
04:03:43.910 --> 04:03:43.920 align:start position:0%
that if you violate this you will be
 
04:03:49.349 --> 04:03:49.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:51.830 --> 04:03:51.840 align:start position:0%
about a couple of days ago or yesterday

some information for the committee and i
 
04:03:59.510 --> 04:03:59.520 align:start position:0%

you might find it representative in an
 
04:04:05.590 --> 04:04:05.600 align:start position:0%

04:04:13.830 --> 04:04:13.840 align:start position:0%
taking my question could you just
 
04:04:15.910 --> 04:04:15.920 align:start position:0%
briefly tell us what the cost of one of
 
04:04:17.510 --> 04:04:17.520 align:start position:0%
these units is
 
04:04:19.910 --> 04:04:19.920 align:start position:0%
and where does the unit actually report
 
04:04:22.469 --> 04:04:22.479 align:start position:0%
to who is getting that gps data from the
 
04:04:25.269 --> 04:04:25.279 align:start position:0%
unit that the diver has on them
 
04:04:32.710 --> 04:04:32.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:32.720 --> 04:04:46.229 align:start position:0%
 
representative

04:04:46.229 --> 04:04:46.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:47.910 --> 04:04:47.920 align:start position:0%
you're off mute but we just can't hear
 
04:04:47.920 --> 04:04:52.710 align:start position:0%
you're off mute but we just can't hear
you

04:04:52.710 --> 04:04:52.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:52.720 --> 04:04:53.990 align:start position:0%
 
nothing

04:04:53.990 --> 04:04:54.000 align:start position:0%
nothing
 
04:04:58.229 --> 04:04:58.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:14.389 --> 04:05:14.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:16.469 --> 04:05:16.479 align:start position:0%
you sound like you're in an echo chamber
 
04:05:17.990 --> 04:05:18.000 align:start position:0%
100 miles away
 
04:05:20.150 --> 04:05:20.160 align:start position:0%
does he have a microphone he can maybe
 
04:05:21.429 --> 04:05:21.439 align:start position:0%
wiggle the cord or something because it
 
04:05:22.870 --> 04:05:22.880 align:start position:0%
seems that sounds like it could be the
 
04:05:24.790 --> 04:05:24.800 align:start position:0%
problem if he's got a mic plugged in
 
04:05:26.469 --> 04:05:26.479 align:start position:0%
yeah you might be right representing
 
04:05:41.670 --> 04:05:41.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:43.429 --> 04:05:43.439 align:start position:0%
do you want to sign out
 
04:05:45.429 --> 04:05:45.439 align:start position:0%
harvard then sign right back in
 
04:05:47.990 --> 04:05:48.000 align:start position:0%
if that might help the buffer
 
04:05:48.000 --> 04:05:49.269 align:start position:0%
if that might help the buffer
whoa

04:05:49.269 --> 04:05:49.279 align:start position:0%
whoa
 
04:05:50.870 --> 04:05:50.880 align:start position:0%
sure it's up to you but i think that's
 
04:05:54.389 --> 04:05:54.399 align:start position:0%
the best yeah whatever you know let's
 
04:05:57.110 --> 04:05:57.120 align:start position:0%
try to get it back on because
 
04:06:00.469 --> 04:06:00.479 align:start position:0%
i think we got a little time with this
 
04:06:02.469 --> 04:06:02.479 align:start position:0%
yeah whatever it takes to get you back
 
04:06:04.790 --> 04:06:04.800 align:start position:0%
on representative heart
 
04:06:06.469 --> 04:06:06.479 align:start position:0%
you just signed off you signed back on
 
04:06:06.479 --> 04:06:10.389 align:start position:0%
you just signed off you signed back on
him

04:06:10.389 --> 04:06:10.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:24.790 --> 04:06:24.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:27.429 --> 04:06:27.439 align:start position:0%
may have to restart your device
 
04:06:29.030 --> 04:06:29.040 align:start position:0%
it's definitely a microphone issue
 
04:06:31.510 --> 04:06:31.520 align:start position:0%
because he you can barely hear him you
 
04:06:33.189 --> 04:06:33.199 align:start position:0%
still can't hear him
 
04:06:33.199 --> 04:06:34.309 align:start position:0%
still can't hear him
right

04:06:34.309 --> 04:06:34.319 align:start position:0%
right
 
04:06:36.950 --> 04:06:36.960 align:start position:0%
and he can call in if he's like yeah
 
04:06:40.150 --> 04:06:40.160 align:start position:0%
right hard you can call in if you'd like
 
04:06:42.309 --> 04:06:42.319 align:start position:0%
uh that might that might be helpful the
 
04:06:44.070 --> 04:06:44.080 align:start position:0%
calling information is on the email that
 
04:06:48.870 --> 04:06:48.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:07.189 --> 04:07:07.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:45.670 --> 04:07:45.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:49.030 --> 04:07:49.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:49.040 --> 04:07:51.110 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:07:51.110 --> 04:07:51.120 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:07:51.120 --> 04:07:53.510 align:start position:0%
okay
okay

04:07:53.510 --> 04:07:53.520 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:07:55.189 --> 04:07:55.199 align:start position:0%
he's just trying to call
 
04:08:11.510 --> 04:08:11.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:11.520 --> 04:08:15.190 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:08:15.190 --> 04:08:15.200 align:start position:0%

04:08:32.630 --> 04:08:32.640 align:start position:0%
can you hear me now there you go welcome
 
04:08:32.640 --> 04:08:34.070 align:start position:0%
can you hear me now there you go welcome
back

04:08:34.070 --> 04:08:34.080 align:start position:0%
back
 
04:08:34.080 --> 04:08:35.110 align:start position:0%
back
okay

04:08:35.110 --> 04:08:35.120 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:08:38.630 --> 04:08:38.640 align:start position:0%
sorry for the technical difficulties
 
04:08:41.189 --> 04:08:41.199 align:start position:0%
i don't know um so the question was how
 
04:08:42.950 --> 04:08:42.960 align:start position:0%
much do they cost
 
04:08:43.990 --> 04:08:44.000 align:start position:0%
i had
 
04:08:47.110 --> 04:08:47.120 align:start position:0%
sent out with my recent email
 
04:08:49.670 --> 04:08:49.680 align:start position:0%
two pages of different prices you can
 
04:08:51.510 --> 04:08:51.520 align:start position:0%
get a garmin that could cost over a
 
04:08:52.950 --> 04:08:52.960 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars
 
04:08:55.830 --> 04:08:55.840 align:start position:0%
there is a device around two hundred
 
04:08:58.950 --> 04:08:58.960 align:start position:0%
dollars a nautilus lifeline marine
 
04:09:03.110 --> 04:09:03.120 align:start position:0%
rescue gps submersible dive
 
04:09:04.870 --> 04:09:04.880 align:start position:0%
you attach that
 
04:09:08.550 --> 04:09:08.560 align:start position:0%
and according to this company nautilus
 
04:09:08.560 --> 04:09:10.070 align:start position:0%
and according to this company nautilus
lifeline

04:09:10.070 --> 04:09:10.080 align:start position:0%
lifeline
 
04:09:10.080 --> 04:09:11.030 align:start position:0%
lifeline
when

04:09:11.030 --> 04:09:11.040 align:start position:0%
when
 
04:09:11.040 --> 04:09:11.990 align:start position:0%
when
the

04:09:11.990 --> 04:09:12.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:09:15.189 --> 04:09:15.199 align:start position:0%
line is released and it goes above water
 
04:09:18.870 --> 04:09:18.880 align:start position:0%
it it's picked up by ships and boats
 
04:09:22.309 --> 04:09:22.319 align:start position:0%
and all boats according to nautilus has
 
04:09:25.110 --> 04:09:25.120 align:start position:0%
the capability of hearing
 
04:09:27.429 --> 04:09:27.439 align:start position:0%
the beep from the
 
04:09:27.439 --> 04:09:28.710 align:start position:0%
the beep from the
machine

04:09:28.710 --> 04:09:28.720 align:start position:0%
machine
 
04:09:30.389 --> 04:09:30.399 align:start position:0%
so you don't need a special thing they
 
04:09:32.389 --> 04:09:32.399 align:start position:0%
said it's one of these
 
04:09:34.950 --> 04:09:34.960 align:start position:0%
and maybe someone that dives can help me
 
04:09:37.510 --> 04:09:37.520 align:start position:0%
out here but it goes on a frequency
 
04:09:39.910 --> 04:09:39.920 align:start position:0%
that's picked up by all boats because
 
04:09:42.229 --> 04:09:42.239 align:start position:0%
they all use that frequency
 
04:09:44.550 --> 04:09:44.560 align:start position:0%
but the prices can can differ
 
04:09:47.030 --> 04:09:47.040 align:start position:0%
i thought about the poor dive shops that
 
04:09:49.429 --> 04:09:49.439 align:start position:0%
would have to buy it initially and then
 
04:09:52.309 --> 04:09:52.319 align:start position:0%
rent it out but then i also considered
 
04:09:55.349 --> 04:09:55.359 align:start position:0%
that for an uh fiscal impact they're
 
04:09:57.750 --> 04:09:57.760 align:start position:0%
going to get money back in renting it
 
04:10:01.189 --> 04:10:01.199 align:start position:0%
and i didn't have the bill dictate how
 
04:10:04.950 --> 04:10:04.960 align:start position:0%
expensive a model they needed to do
 
04:10:06.790 --> 04:10:06.800 align:start position:0%
because i don't know which ones they
 
04:10:09.429 --> 04:10:09.439 align:start position:0%
like or which ones they may use if they
 
04:10:11.510 --> 04:10:11.520 align:start position:0%
dive because i i would assume most of
 
04:10:14.710 --> 04:10:14.720 align:start position:0%
the guys running uh dive shots dive i
 
04:10:16.309 --> 04:10:16.319 align:start position:0%
just don't
 
04:10:18.870 --> 04:10:18.880 align:start position:0%
so the prices can be the cheapest that i
 
04:10:22.070 --> 04:10:22.080 align:start position:0%
saw was like 150 dollars
 
04:10:25.750 --> 04:10:25.760 align:start position:0%
for one of these nautilus lifeline and
 
04:10:29.269 --> 04:10:29.279 align:start position:0%
then i saw some that actually were like
 
04:10:31.349 --> 04:10:31.359 align:start position:0%
twelve hundred dollars nine hundred
 
04:10:31.359 --> 04:10:33.830 align:start position:0%
twelve hundred dollars nine hundred
dollars

04:10:33.830 --> 04:10:33.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:35.510 --> 04:10:35.520 align:start position:0%
but i would leave that up to the dive
 
04:10:35.520 --> 04:10:45.110 align:start position:0%
but i would leave that up to the dive
shop

04:10:45.110 --> 04:10:45.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:46.150 --> 04:10:46.160 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking the question
 
04:10:48.229 --> 04:10:48.239 align:start position:0%
representative i'm sorry i missed the
 
04:10:50.630 --> 04:10:50.640 align:start position:0%
beginning introduction i was logging in
 
04:10:53.590 --> 04:10:53.600 align:start position:0%
um so is this primarily to be used in
 
04:10:56.630 --> 04:10:56.640 align:start position:0%
our lakes or do we have some
 
04:10:58.150 --> 04:10:58.160 align:start position:0%
um uh
 
04:10:59.830 --> 04:10:59.840 align:start position:0%
does the state have some hold over the
 
04:11:02.550 --> 04:11:02.560 align:start position:0%
ocean waters out to a specific mileage
 
04:11:03.910 --> 04:11:03.920 align:start position:0%
that's and then i have a follow on
 
04:11:03.920 --> 04:11:05.110 align:start position:0%
that's and then i have a follow on
please

04:11:05.110 --> 04:11:05.120 align:start position:0%
please
 
04:11:07.830 --> 04:11:07.840 align:start position:0%
well until you it would be in both lakes
 
04:11:11.990 --> 04:11:12.000 align:start position:0%
and ocean i know uh there's dive shops
 
04:11:14.469 --> 04:11:14.479 align:start position:0%
out on our ocean
 
04:11:14.479 --> 04:11:15.510 align:start position:0%
out on our ocean
uh

04:11:15.510 --> 04:11:15.520 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:11:15.520 --> 04:11:16.550 align:start position:0%
uh
frontage

04:11:16.550 --> 04:11:16.560 align:start position:0%
frontage
 
04:11:19.510 --> 04:11:19.520 align:start position:0%
and as i what you missed is in one of
 
04:11:21.590 --> 04:11:21.600 align:start position:0%
the towns i represent
 
04:11:24.550 --> 04:11:24.560 align:start position:0%
there's a dive shop there and
 
04:11:24.560 --> 04:11:25.349 align:start position:0%
there's a dive shop there and
they

04:11:25.349 --> 04:11:25.359 align:start position:0%
they
 
04:11:28.070 --> 04:11:28.080 align:start position:0%
uh rent scuba gear and things so it
 
04:11:29.510 --> 04:11:29.520 align:start position:0%
would be for both
 
04:11:31.189 --> 04:11:31.199 align:start position:0%
but there's just for rental it's it's
 
04:11:33.750 --> 04:11:33.760 align:start position:0%
not a mandate for you personally if you
 
04:11:36.550 --> 04:11:36.560 align:start position:0%
have your own equipment it's just if i
 
04:11:38.870 --> 04:11:38.880 align:start position:0%
walk into a dive shop
 
04:11:41.830 --> 04:11:41.840 align:start position:0%
and want to rent scuba gear
 
04:11:45.110 --> 04:11:45.120 align:start position:0%
i wanted the dot the actually the my
 
04:11:47.910 --> 04:11:47.920 align:start position:0%
constituent wanted the dive shop to
 
04:11:51.189 --> 04:11:51.199 align:start position:0%
offer me to rent the gps
 
04:11:53.429 --> 04:11:53.439 align:start position:0%
i'm not forced to rent it
 
04:11:56.630 --> 04:11:56.640 align:start position:0%
they're just asked to make it available
 
04:11:59.830 --> 04:11:59.840 align:start position:0%
so if they rent me a scuba tank and gear
 
04:12:03.910 --> 04:12:03.920 align:start position:0%
and masks and all that just say gee
 
04:12:06.150 --> 04:12:06.160 align:start position:0%
are you interested in renting a gps i
 
04:12:08.950 --> 04:12:08.960 align:start position:0%
have one you can rent and you
 
04:12:12.630 --> 04:12:12.640 align:start position:0%
i i sort of equated it to like riding a
 
04:12:15.110 --> 04:12:15.120 align:start position:0%
motorcycle with a helmet i mean this you
 
04:12:17.349 --> 04:12:17.359 align:start position:0%
can sell a helmet or
 
04:12:19.830 --> 04:12:19.840 align:start position:0%
you don't have to wear one so we're not
 
04:12:23.189 --> 04:12:23.199 align:start position:0%
forcing anyone to use the gps just to
 
04:12:26.150 --> 04:12:26.160 align:start position:0%
make it available for them if they wish
 
04:12:30.070 --> 04:12:30.080 align:start position:0%
to lease it or rent it
 
04:12:31.750 --> 04:12:31.760 align:start position:0%
can i have a follow-on please share mr
 
04:12:31.760 --> 04:12:33.110 align:start position:0%
can i have a follow-on please share mr
sherman

04:12:33.110 --> 04:12:33.120 align:start position:0%
sherman
 
04:12:35.750 --> 04:12:35.760 align:start position:0%
for a follow-up
 
04:12:38.229 --> 04:12:38.239 align:start position:0%
so i guess i'm confused um i'm not quite
 
04:12:40.389 --> 04:12:40.399 align:start position:0%
sure what the purpose of the gps is if
 
04:12:41.830 --> 04:12:41.840 align:start position:0%
you're underwater and you can't find
 
04:12:44.229 --> 04:12:44.239 align:start position:0%
your boat go to the surface and look so
 
04:12:46.550 --> 04:12:46.560 align:start position:0%
is it to control the equipment so that
 
04:12:48.710 --> 04:12:48.720 align:start position:0%
the dive shop can track their equipment
 
04:12:50.469 --> 04:12:50.479 align:start position:0%
or is it for the protection of the
 
04:12:52.229 --> 04:12:52.239 align:start position:0%
individual that might get lost from a
 
04:12:54.790 --> 04:12:54.800 align:start position:0%
boat when they're on the ocean or in the
 
04:12:54.800 --> 04:12:57.349 align:start position:0%
boat when they're on the ocean or in the
lake

04:12:57.349 --> 04:12:57.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:00.389 --> 04:13:00.399 align:start position:0%
the ladder if not only yeah if they
 
04:13:02.710 --> 04:13:02.720 align:start position:0%
could go up to the surface they could at
 
04:13:06.389 --> 04:13:06.399 align:start position:0%
least see what's going on it's uh for a
 
04:13:09.750 --> 04:13:09.760 align:start position:0%
diver that may be uh caught under a rock
 
04:13:11.910 --> 04:13:11.920 align:start position:0%
or something fell on him or he's in
 
04:13:14.469 --> 04:13:14.479 align:start position:0%
distress under the water and he can't
 
04:13:16.149 --> 04:13:16.159 align:start position:0%
get to the surface
 
04:13:16.159 --> 04:13:17.670 align:start position:0%
get to the surface
or

04:13:17.670 --> 04:13:17.680 align:start position:0%
or
 
04:13:20.149 --> 04:13:20.159 align:start position:0%
if something happens to him
 
04:13:22.630 --> 04:13:22.640 align:start position:0%
and he asks for help they may not get to
 
04:13:24.710 --> 04:13:24.720 align:start position:0%
him right away to rescue him but at
 
04:13:27.510 --> 04:13:27.520 align:start position:0%
least they'll be able uh to know about
 
04:13:30.550 --> 04:13:30.560 align:start position:0%
where he is this uh nautilus lifeline
 
04:13:33.830 --> 04:13:33.840 align:start position:0%
says that it works within 1.5 meters of
 
04:13:35.590 --> 04:13:35.600 align:start position:0%
where you actually are
 
04:13:37.990 --> 04:13:38.000 align:start position:0%
so they they could find them
 
04:13:38.000 --> 04:13:39.349 align:start position:0%
so they they could find them
so

04:13:39.349 --> 04:13:39.359 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:13:43.590 --> 04:13:43.600 align:start position:0%
it is for both lakes and the ocean
 
04:13:45.030 --> 04:13:45.040 align:start position:0%
but it's only if you're renting
 
04:13:49.590 --> 04:13:49.600 align:start position:0%
equipment from a shop in new hampshire
 
04:13:51.910 --> 04:13:51.920 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:13:51.920 --> 04:13:55.110 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

04:13:55.110 --> 04:13:55.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:57.670 --> 04:13:57.680 align:start position:0%
uh representative cohen for the question
 
04:13:59.510 --> 04:13:59.520 align:start position:0%
representative carb thank you for taking
 
04:14:00.790 --> 04:14:00.800 align:start position:0%
my question
 
04:14:03.429 --> 04:14:03.439 align:start position:0%
does the bill as written
 
04:14:06.070 --> 04:14:06.080 align:start position:0%
require a dive shop
 
04:14:08.710 --> 04:14:08.720 align:start position:0%
to purchase a gps
 
04:14:11.429 --> 04:14:11.439 align:start position:0%
for every set of scuba equipment that he
 
04:14:12.630 --> 04:14:12.640 align:start position:0%
or she has
 
04:14:18.309 --> 04:14:18.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:20.950 --> 04:14:20.960 align:start position:0%
it doesn't specify uh representative
 
04:14:23.189 --> 04:14:23.199 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question it it doesn't
 
04:14:25.349 --> 04:14:25.359 align:start position:0%
specify how many they need to get they
 
04:14:28.309 --> 04:14:28.319 align:start position:0%
just need to offer it to the diver
 
04:14:30.389 --> 04:14:30.399 align:start position:0%
and i didn't have a poll i don't know
 
04:14:32.710 --> 04:14:32.720 align:start position:0%
how many divers would even want to rent
 
04:14:32.720 --> 04:14:33.590 align:start position:0%
how many divers would even want to rent
it

04:14:33.590 --> 04:14:33.600 align:start position:0%
it
 
04:14:33.600 --> 04:14:34.630 align:start position:0%
it
um

04:14:34.630 --> 04:14:34.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:14:36.469 --> 04:14:36.479 align:start position:0%
you know maybe a diver says i don't need
 
04:14:38.710 --> 04:14:38.720 align:start position:0%
it i'm going to kingston lake in
 
04:14:40.229 --> 04:14:40.239 align:start position:0%
kingston new hampshire
 
04:14:42.790 --> 04:14:42.800 align:start position:0%
i'm okay i don't need it
 
04:14:44.389 --> 04:14:44.399 align:start position:0%
so i don't know how many that need to
 
04:14:44.399 --> 04:14:45.910 align:start position:0%
so i don't know how many that need to
buy

04:14:45.910 --> 04:14:45.920 align:start position:0%
buy
 
04:14:48.389 --> 04:14:48.399 align:start position:0%
i wasn't able to the dive shops that i
 
04:14:51.750 --> 04:14:51.760 align:start position:0%
talked to and i tried to contact
 
04:14:53.269 --> 04:14:53.279 align:start position:0%
uh patty
 
04:14:53.279 --> 04:14:54.790 align:start position:0%
uh patty
that

04:14:54.790 --> 04:14:54.800 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:14:57.030 --> 04:14:57.040 align:start position:0%
license not licensed that certifies
 
04:14:57.040 --> 04:14:58.389 align:start position:0%
license not licensed that certifies
divers

04:14:58.389 --> 04:14:58.399 align:start position:0%
divers
 
04:15:00.550 --> 04:15:00.560 align:start position:0%
but i don't have any statistics about
 
04:15:02.710 --> 04:15:02.720 align:start position:0%
you know how how many
 
04:15:05.030 --> 04:15:05.040 align:start position:0%
tanks do they rent in a day these places
 
04:15:05.040 --> 04:15:05.910 align:start position:0%
tanks do they rent in a day these places
and

04:15:05.910 --> 04:15:05.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:15:09.349 --> 04:15:09.359 align:start position:0%
how many people ask them about gps's
 
04:15:12.149 --> 04:15:12.159 align:start position:0%
um those statistics were not available i
 
04:15:14.389 --> 04:15:14.399 align:start position:0%
just went like you would go online and
 
04:15:16.550 --> 04:15:16.560 align:start position:0%
googled and tried to reach out to a
 
04:15:19.750 --> 04:15:19.760 align:start position:0%
couple of the major dive organizations a
 
04:15:21.750 --> 04:15:21.760 align:start position:0%
lot of them are out in california i was
 
04:15:24.070 --> 04:15:24.080 align:start position:0%
calling san francisco saying can you
 
04:15:25.510 --> 04:15:25.520 align:start position:0%
give me some information what do you
 
04:15:27.990 --> 04:15:28.000 align:start position:0%
think about this bill i will tell you i
 
04:15:29.269 --> 04:15:29.279 align:start position:0%
didn't get
 
04:15:32.710 --> 04:15:32.720 align:start position:0%
responses from major dive places that i
 
04:15:35.349 --> 04:15:35.359 align:start position:0%
asked but i did get a response from my
 
04:15:37.910 --> 04:15:37.920 align:start position:0%
local dive shop in atkinson new
 
04:15:39.269 --> 04:15:39.279 align:start position:0%
hampshire that
 
04:15:41.670 --> 04:15:41.680 align:start position:0%
anything we can do to help
 
04:15:44.550 --> 04:15:44.560 align:start position:0%
make it safer for divers he was okay
 
04:15:44.560 --> 04:15:45.670 align:start position:0%
make it safer for divers he was okay
with

04:15:45.670 --> 04:15:45.680 align:start position:0%
with
 
04:15:47.269 --> 04:15:47.279 align:start position:0%
follow one question please mr
 
04:15:50.309 --> 04:15:50.319 align:start position:0%
chairperson well follow
 
04:15:52.870 --> 04:15:52.880 align:start position:0%
representative harv so does that mean if
 
04:15:54.630 --> 04:15:54.640 align:start position:0%
the dive shop
 
04:15:56.790 --> 04:15:56.800 align:start position:0%
i'm just making an arbitrary number has
 
04:15:56.800 --> 04:15:57.750 align:start position:0%
i'm just making an arbitrary number has
10

04:15:57.750 --> 04:15:57.760 align:start position:0%
10
 
04:16:01.189 --> 04:16:01.199 align:start position:0%
scuba systems and 10 scuba systems are
 
04:16:03.189 --> 04:16:03.199 align:start position:0%
rented that day
 
04:16:05.590 --> 04:16:05.600 align:start position:0%
and a person comes or say that he only
 
04:16:08.070 --> 04:16:08.080 align:start position:0%
buys five that the owner buys five so he
 
04:16:11.110 --> 04:16:11.120 align:start position:0%
has some available but rents out ten
 
04:16:12.870 --> 04:16:12.880 align:start position:0%
systems that day
 
04:16:15.670 --> 04:16:15.680 align:start position:0%
if the person number six that wants to
 
04:16:17.269 --> 04:16:17.279 align:start position:0%
rent a gps
 
04:16:19.750 --> 04:16:19.760 align:start position:0%
doesn't have one available is the owner
 
04:16:24.950 --> 04:16:24.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:26.309 --> 04:16:26.319 align:start position:0%
well thank you for the question i think
 
04:16:28.950 --> 04:16:28.960 align:start position:0%
that's a good question in practical
 
04:16:28.960 --> 04:16:32.149 align:start position:0%
that's a good question in practical
application

04:16:32.149 --> 04:16:32.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:34.790 --> 04:16:34.800 align:start position:0%
technically i think he would be
 
04:16:36.710 --> 04:16:36.720 align:start position:0%
because he's offering it
 
04:16:40.950 --> 04:16:40.960 align:start position:0%
for lease but doesn't have it to give
 
04:16:44.630 --> 04:16:44.640 align:start position:0%
i just don't know if it's likely that uh
 
04:16:47.189 --> 04:16:47.199 align:start position:0%
woody act would that actually happen but
 
04:16:50.309 --> 04:16:50.319 align:start position:0%
the the law is written or as amended by
 
04:16:52.630 --> 04:16:52.640 align:start position:0%
my amendment simply says
 
04:16:56.229 --> 04:16:56.239 align:start position:0%
you have to also lease that equipment
 
04:16:58.229 --> 04:16:58.239 align:start position:0%
that's all it says
 
04:17:00.550 --> 04:17:00.560 align:start position:0%
i wish i had more statistics to tell you
 
04:17:03.189 --> 04:17:03.199 align:start position:0%
i actually have no idea how many
 
04:17:06.070 --> 04:17:06.080 align:start position:0%
uh tanks does a dive shop lease in the
 
04:17:06.080 --> 04:17:09.590 align:start position:0%
uh tanks does a dive shop lease in the
day

04:17:09.590 --> 04:17:09.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:11.429 --> 04:17:11.439 align:start position:0%
my concern was
 
04:17:14.469 --> 04:17:14.479 align:start position:0%
for the safety of the diver
 
04:17:16.389 --> 04:17:16.399 align:start position:0%
and it's not required
 
04:17:18.950 --> 04:17:18.960 align:start position:0%
that they have it available to even
 
04:17:21.830 --> 04:17:21.840 align:start position:0%
offer to him so the purpose was to make
 
04:17:23.269 --> 04:17:23.279 align:start position:0%
it available
 
04:17:25.990 --> 04:17:26.000 align:start position:0%
to ask a good question representative
 
04:17:27.750 --> 04:17:27.760 align:start position:0%
representative dodge sir
 
04:17:33.590 --> 04:17:33.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:39.110 --> 04:17:39.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:41.990 --> 04:17:42.000 align:start position:0%
i'm that guy now thank you mr chair and
 
04:17:45.189 --> 04:17:45.199 align:start position:0%
um uh question representative harb
 
04:17:47.269 --> 04:17:47.279 align:start position:0%
you compared this to um
 
04:17:49.429 --> 04:17:49.439 align:start position:0%
essentially similar to a helmet law
 
04:17:51.110 --> 04:17:51.120 align:start position:0%
which here in new hampshire we we don't
 
04:17:51.120 --> 04:17:53.189 align:start position:0%
which here in new hampshire we we don't
have

04:17:53.189 --> 04:17:53.199 align:start position:0%
have
 
04:17:55.990 --> 04:17:56.000 align:start position:0%
now if i have this correct the dive
 
04:17:57.510 --> 04:17:57.520 align:start position:0%
shops would actually
 
04:17:59.510 --> 04:17:59.520 align:start position:0%
face some sort of punishment if they
 
04:17:59.520 --> 04:18:00.469 align:start position:0%
face some sort of punishment if they
don't

04:18:00.469 --> 04:18:00.479 align:start position:0%
don't
 
04:18:03.349 --> 04:18:03.359 align:start position:0%
have these gps systems on hand
 
04:18:05.750 --> 04:18:05.760 align:start position:0%
to rent out their equipment
 
04:18:05.760 --> 04:18:07.269 align:start position:0%
to rent out their equipment
so

04:18:07.269 --> 04:18:07.279 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:18:09.030 --> 04:18:09.040 align:start position:0%
regardless as to whether they actually
 
04:18:11.429 --> 04:18:11.439 align:start position:0%
rent the gps or not
 
04:18:13.910 --> 04:18:13.920 align:start position:0%
the dive shops are fiscally responsible
 
04:18:16.790 --> 04:18:16.800 align:start position:0%
for having these units in stock
 
04:18:16.800 --> 04:18:18.229 align:start position:0%
for having these units in stock
now

04:18:18.229 --> 04:18:18.239 align:start position:0%
now
 
04:18:21.110 --> 04:18:21.120 align:start position:0%
our motorcycle companies mandated by law
 
04:18:23.189 --> 04:18:23.199 align:start position:0%
to actually sell helmets or
 
04:18:24.790 --> 04:18:24.800 align:start position:0%
do you know if they do that voluntarily
 
04:18:27.990 --> 04:18:28.000 align:start position:0%
as a good business practice
 
04:18:29.510 --> 04:18:29.520 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question i only
 
04:18:31.429 --> 04:18:31.439 align:start position:0%
brought up the helmets because as the
 
04:18:31.439 --> 04:18:32.550 align:start position:0%
brought up the helmets because as the
rider

04:18:32.550 --> 04:18:32.560 align:start position:0%
rider
 
04:18:36.309 --> 04:18:36.319 align:start position:0%
not the leaser of motorcycles but as the
 
04:18:38.229 --> 04:18:38.239 align:start position:0%
rider in new hampshire i know we don't
 
04:18:40.950 --> 04:18:40.960 align:start position:0%
require it so it's at the option of the
 
04:18:43.349 --> 04:18:43.359 align:start position:0%
rider if he wants to wear a helmet or
 
04:18:46.070 --> 04:18:46.080 align:start position:0%
not and i know many riders my daughter
 
04:18:48.149 --> 04:18:48.159 align:start position:0%
arrives she wears a helmet some people
 
04:18:51.670 --> 04:18:51.680 align:start position:0%
don't but the same thing with the gps
 
04:18:55.110 --> 04:18:55.120 align:start position:0%
the diver does not have to rent it the
 
04:18:57.910 --> 04:18:57.920 align:start position:0%
diver does not have to use it
 
04:19:00.070 --> 04:19:00.080 align:start position:0%
the bill is structured that it's just
 
04:19:03.030 --> 04:19:03.040 align:start position:0%
offered to him that's all right
 
04:19:05.590 --> 04:19:05.600 align:start position:0%
so like that's why i i compared the two
 
04:19:07.670 --> 04:19:07.680 align:start position:0%
because it's all it's up to the freedom
 
04:19:09.269 --> 04:19:09.279 align:start position:0%
of the individual
 
04:19:12.149 --> 04:19:12.159 align:start position:0%
you don't have to to where buy it or
 
04:19:14.229 --> 04:19:14.239 align:start position:0%
rent it if you don't want it
 
04:19:17.269 --> 04:19:17.279 align:start position:0%
now according to my uh constituent
 
04:19:19.670 --> 04:19:19.680 align:start position:0%
a lot of people will have
 
04:19:22.149 --> 04:19:22.159 align:start position:0%
gps type equipment
 
04:19:22.159 --> 04:19:23.670 align:start position:0%
gps type equipment
but

04:19:23.670 --> 04:19:23.680 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:19:26.229 --> 04:19:26.239 align:start position:0%
if they are driving where they live but
 
04:19:27.910 --> 04:19:27.920 align:start position:0%
if they go somewhere else we have
 
04:19:30.630 --> 04:19:30.640 align:start position:0%
somebody from mass that comes up or
 
04:19:32.229 --> 04:19:32.239 align:start position:0%
florida that comes up they're not going
 
04:19:34.790 --> 04:19:34.800 align:start position:0%
to drag their tanks with them probably
 
04:19:37.830 --> 04:19:37.840 align:start position:0%
but if they rent them in new hampshire
 
04:19:40.389 --> 04:19:40.399 align:start position:0%
the constituent thought it would be
 
04:19:42.309 --> 04:19:42.319 align:start position:0%
excellent if we could say
 
04:19:43.750 --> 04:19:43.760 align:start position:0%
we're going to offer it to them because
 
04:19:45.670 --> 04:19:45.680 align:start position:0%
she didn't want the same thing to happen
 
04:19:48.469 --> 04:19:48.479 align:start position:0%
to them who are away from their home
 
04:19:51.030 --> 04:19:51.040 align:start position:0%
renting equipment and didn't bring their
 
04:19:55.990 --> 04:19:56.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:57.750 --> 04:19:57.760 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
04:19:59.429 --> 04:19:59.439 align:start position:0%
representative poster
 
04:20:02.070 --> 04:20:02.080 align:start position:0%
representative post
 
04:20:05.269 --> 04:20:05.279 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and um uh
 
04:20:07.830 --> 04:20:07.840 align:start position:0%
i would like to know um if this
 
04:20:11.269 --> 04:20:11.279 align:start position:0%
constituent who was looking for
 
04:20:14.389 --> 04:20:14.399 align:start position:0%
a gps model had gone to
 
04:20:16.469 --> 04:20:16.479 align:start position:0%
a store and they said we don't carry
 
04:20:20.550 --> 04:20:20.560 align:start position:0%
them and i wondered also if you know if
 
04:20:22.950 --> 04:20:22.960 align:start position:0%
in talking to any of the stores that you
 
04:20:23.990 --> 04:20:24.000 align:start position:0%
talked to
 
04:20:26.149 --> 04:20:26.159 align:start position:0%
if they said that people asked for them
 
04:20:26.159 --> 04:20:29.189 align:start position:0%
if they said that people asked for them
frequently

04:20:29.189 --> 04:20:29.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:31.269 --> 04:20:31.279 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question when i spoke
 
04:20:33.670 --> 04:20:33.680 align:start position:0%
to the dive shop locally i didn't ask
 
04:20:35.910 --> 04:20:35.920 align:start position:0%
him if people asked for it
 
04:20:38.149 --> 04:20:38.159 align:start position:0%
i asked him
 
04:20:40.550 --> 04:20:40.560 align:start position:0%
what he what's his position on the the
 
04:20:40.560 --> 04:20:41.590 align:start position:0%
what he what's his position on the the
bill

04:20:41.590 --> 04:20:41.600 align:start position:0%
bill
 
04:20:43.269 --> 04:20:43.279 align:start position:0%
because i wanted to know what the local
 
04:20:45.750 --> 04:20:45.760 align:start position:0%
what a dive shop would say and as far as
 
04:20:47.830 --> 04:20:47.840 align:start position:0%
the constituent's husband he was in the
 
04:20:50.790 --> 04:20:50.800 align:start position:0%
caribbean so she doesn't know what he
 
04:20:53.830 --> 04:20:53.840 align:start position:0%
was asked or told in the caribbean she
 
04:20:56.389 --> 04:20:56.399 align:start position:0%
just knows when he was lost they told
 
04:20:59.510 --> 04:20:59.520 align:start position:0%
her gee too bad he didn't have a gps
 
04:20:59.520 --> 04:21:00.469 align:start position:0%
her gee too bad he didn't have a gps
and

04:21:00.469 --> 04:21:00.479 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:21:01.750 --> 04:21:01.760 align:start position:0%
because then we could have found his
 
04:21:04.149 --> 04:21:04.159 align:start position:0%
body or maybe we might have been able to
 
04:21:05.269 --> 04:21:05.279 align:start position:0%
track him
 
04:21:07.590 --> 04:21:07.600 align:start position:0%
he did get as one of the representatives
 
04:21:09.189 --> 04:21:09.199 align:start position:0%
say he didn't get separated from his
 
04:21:13.910 --> 04:21:13.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:16.070 --> 04:21:16.080 align:start position:0%
i know the caribbean isn't new hampshire
 
04:21:16.080 --> 04:21:17.429 align:start position:0%
i know the caribbean isn't new hampshire
but

04:21:17.429 --> 04:21:17.439 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:21:19.590 --> 04:21:19.600 align:start position:0%
i see the same thing could happen an out
 
04:21:22.870 --> 04:21:22.880 align:start position:0%
of state person comes in rents equipment
 
04:21:24.550 --> 04:21:24.560 align:start position:0%
goes diving
 
04:21:26.870 --> 04:21:26.880 align:start position:0%
maybe doesn't have a boat maybe walks
 
04:21:28.710 --> 04:21:28.720 align:start position:0%
into a lake i don't know
 
04:21:28.720 --> 04:21:29.910 align:start position:0%
into a lake i don't know
um

04:21:29.910 --> 04:21:29.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:21:29.920 --> 04:21:30.950 align:start position:0%
um
and

04:21:30.950 --> 04:21:30.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:21:33.110 --> 04:21:33.120 align:start position:0%
he doesn't have the opportunity
 
04:21:35.510 --> 04:21:35.520 align:start position:0%
for for getting one of these if it's not
 
04:21:35.520 --> 04:21:41.110 align:start position:0%
for for getting one of these if it's not
offered

04:21:41.110 --> 04:21:41.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:43.830 --> 04:21:43.840 align:start position:0%

anyone else
uh

04:21:56.229 --> 04:21:56.239 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:21:57.670 --> 04:21:57.680 align:start position:0%

representative representative post just
 
04:22:01.920 --> 04:22:04.389 align:start position:0%
representative representative post just
raised

04:22:04.389 --> 04:22:04.399 align:start position:0%
raised
 
04:22:08.070 --> 04:22:08.080 align:start position:0%

thank you yes i'm sorry i just wanted to
 
04:22:12.149 --> 04:22:12.159 align:start position:0%
do a follow-up to representative nables
 
04:22:14.710 --> 04:22:14.720 align:start position:0%
but mabel's question about who will
 
04:22:17.590 --> 04:22:17.600 align:start position:0%
receive the beacon and i guess i was
 
04:22:21.990 --> 04:22:22.000 align:start position:0%
thinking about um if if it was um sent
 
04:22:24.870 --> 04:22:24.880 align:start position:0%
out and um you know no one got to this
 
04:22:27.269 --> 04:22:27.279 align:start position:0%
person would there be any legality to
 
04:22:38.229 --> 04:22:38.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:40.309 --> 04:22:40.319 align:start position:0%
if that's directed to me uh
 
04:22:41.670 --> 04:22:41.680 align:start position:0%
representative thank you for the
 
04:22:41.680 --> 04:22:42.710 align:start position:0%
representative thank you for the
question

04:22:42.710 --> 04:22:42.720 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:22:45.269 --> 04:22:45.279 align:start position:0%
i it i don't see
 
04:22:49.590 --> 04:22:49.600 align:start position:0%
if nobody catches it
 
04:22:51.510 --> 04:22:51.520 align:start position:0%
it would be difficult in my opinion just
 
04:22:53.670 --> 04:22:53.680 align:start position:0%
my personal opinion to hold the dive
 
04:22:55.670 --> 04:22:55.680 align:start position:0%
shop responsible
 
04:22:58.550 --> 04:22:58.560 align:start position:0%
on if nobody heard the beacon let's say
 
04:23:00.790 --> 04:23:00.800 align:start position:0%
or the beacon didn't catch anybody
 
04:23:02.229 --> 04:23:02.239 align:start position:0%
like anything if they're renting
 
04:23:03.990 --> 04:23:04.000 align:start position:0%
equipment they have to make sure that
 
04:23:06.469 --> 04:23:06.479 align:start position:0%
it's good equipment and it's uh
 
04:23:09.910 --> 04:23:09.920 align:start position:0%
habitable marketable good for its use
 
04:23:11.830 --> 04:23:11.840 align:start position:0%
i think they would be responsible if
 
04:23:14.389 --> 04:23:14.399 align:start position:0%
they rented a defective
 
04:23:17.269 --> 04:23:17.279 align:start position:0%
gps knowing it was defective but the
 
04:23:18.950 --> 04:23:18.960 align:start position:0%
bill doesn't talk about
 
04:23:22.950 --> 04:23:22.960 align:start position:0%
liability for products and product use
 
04:23:25.349 --> 04:23:25.359 align:start position:0%
the bill simply talks about
 
04:23:30.149 --> 04:23:30.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:31.590 --> 04:23:31.600 align:start position:0%

representative gold for for a question
 
04:23:37.110 --> 04:23:37.120 align:start position:0%
okay thank you for taking my question
 
04:23:38.950 --> 04:23:38.960 align:start position:0%
again um
 
04:23:40.550 --> 04:23:40.560 align:start position:0%
about the um
 
04:23:42.469 --> 04:23:42.479 align:start position:0%
who would hear the signal
 
04:23:45.750 --> 04:23:45.760 align:start position:0%
what if the person is way inland at a
 
04:23:49.189 --> 04:23:49.199 align:start position:0%
lake are there boats close enough to
 
04:23:54.229 --> 04:23:54.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:56.950 --> 04:23:56.960 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question um i don't
 
04:23:59.269 --> 04:23:59.279 align:start position:0%
have an answer for you on that
 
04:24:02.229 --> 04:24:02.239 align:start position:0%
um i just know what i was reading uh
 
04:24:03.750 --> 04:24:03.760 align:start position:0%
under the
 
04:24:03.760 --> 04:24:05.590 align:start position:0%

04:24:05.590 --> 04:24:05.600 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:24:08.229 --> 04:24:08.239 align:start position:0%
if you google nautilus lifeline marine
 
04:24:11.110 --> 04:24:11.120 align:start position:0%
rescue they have an information block
 
04:24:13.349 --> 04:24:13.359 align:start position:0%
underneath it and it talks about the
 
04:24:13.359 --> 04:24:14.790 align:start position:0%
underneath it and it talks about the
range

04:24:14.790 --> 04:24:14.800 align:start position:0%
range
 
04:24:16.870 --> 04:24:16.880 align:start position:0%
how many feet under the water does it
 
04:24:16.880 --> 04:24:18.550 align:start position:0%
how many feet under the water does it
work

04:24:18.550 --> 04:24:18.560 align:start position:0%
work
 
04:24:21.429 --> 04:24:21.439 align:start position:0%
and how accurate is it and it talks
 
04:24:23.910 --> 04:24:23.920 align:start position:0%
about the beacon that's sent out and who
 
04:24:25.750 --> 04:24:25.760 align:start position:0%
would get it and
 
04:24:27.269 --> 04:24:27.279 align:start position:0%
that's the limit of my knowledge
 
04:24:27.279 --> 04:24:28.790 align:start position:0%
that's the limit of my knowledge

04:26:24.790 --> 04:26:24.800 align:start position:0%
commentary uh for the record i'm
 
04:26:26.870 --> 04:26:26.880 align:start position:0%
representative erica leon representing
 
04:26:28.550 --> 04:26:28.560 align:start position:0%
rockingham sixth and gary but i'm
 
04:26:31.110 --> 04:26:31.120 align:start position:0%
speaking as an individual here
 
04:26:33.349 --> 04:26:33.359 align:start position:0%
representative harp my heart breaks for
 
04:26:35.750 --> 04:26:35.760 align:start position:0%
your consistent constituent and i feel
 
04:26:37.590 --> 04:26:37.600 align:start position:0%
even worse that the buddy plan broke
 
04:26:40.229 --> 04:26:40.239 align:start position:0%
down on on her husband's dive and that
 
04:26:42.070 --> 04:26:42.080 align:start position:0%
your constituent was misled to believe
 
04:26:43.590 --> 04:26:43.600 align:start position:0%
that the technology
 
04:26:43.600 --> 04:26:44.630 align:start position:0%
that the technology
exists

04:26:44.630 --> 04:26:44.640 align:start position:0%
exists
 
04:26:46.870 --> 04:26:46.880 align:start position:0%
that could locate him after he was lost
 
04:26:49.830 --> 04:26:49.840 align:start position:0%
on a dive and likely underwater
 
04:26:51.429 --> 04:26:51.439 align:start position:0%
in preparing for this hearing i spoke
 
04:26:53.189 --> 04:26:53.199 align:start position:0%
with two dive instructors one was
 
04:26:55.030 --> 04:26:55.040 align:start position:0%
involved in multiple recovery efforts in
 
04:26:56.790 --> 04:26:56.800 align:start position:0%
new hampshire and we did when we
 
04:26:59.349 --> 04:26:59.359 align:start position:0%
discussed underwater gps technology he
 
04:27:01.110 --> 04:27:01.120 align:start position:0%
wished expressed a wish for a device
 
04:27:03.830 --> 04:27:03.840 align:start position:0%
that could find a submerged body but the
 
04:27:05.750 --> 04:27:05.760 align:start position:0%
technology is not there
 
04:27:07.750 --> 04:27:07.760 align:start position:0%
when i looked up the nautilus lifeline
 
04:27:10.469 --> 04:27:10.479 align:start position:0%
product it must be activated manually on
 
04:27:11.990 --> 04:27:12.000 align:start position:0%
the surface through several steps that
 
04:27:14.309 --> 04:27:14.319 align:start position:0%
would be out of reach for a diver who's
 
04:27:15.910 --> 04:27:15.920 align:start position:0%
suffering from the bends or another
 
04:27:17.830 --> 04:27:17.840 align:start position:0%
medical emergency that is likely to
 
04:27:19.349 --> 04:27:19.359 align:start position:0%
happen when they're separated from their
 
04:27:21.030 --> 04:27:21.040 align:start position:0%
dive buddy and the rest of their dive
 
04:27:21.040 --> 04:27:22.710 align:start position:0%
dive buddy and the rest of their dive
group

04:27:22.710 --> 04:27:22.720 align:start position:0%
group
 
04:27:23.750 --> 04:27:23.760 align:start position:0%
it is
 
04:27:26.790 --> 04:27:26.800 align:start position:0%
it's a technology that i wish was
 
04:27:29.030 --> 04:27:29.040 align:start position:0%
available and was accessible but i'm
 
04:27:31.110 --> 04:27:31.120 align:start position:0%
afraid that hearing that they can rent a
 
04:27:33.349 --> 04:27:33.359 align:start position:0%
gps that will help find them and locate
 
04:27:35.189 --> 04:27:35.199 align:start position:0%
them will give divers a false sense of
 
04:27:35.199 --> 04:27:36.389 align:start position:0%
them will give divers a false sense of
security

04:27:36.389 --> 04:27:36.399 align:start position:0%
security
 
04:27:38.469 --> 04:27:38.479 align:start position:0%
i do want to note that many divers will
 
04:27:40.469 --> 04:27:40.479 align:start position:0%
bring their core equipment their bcd
 
04:27:42.070 --> 04:27:42.080 align:start position:0%
which is the buoyancy compensating
 
04:27:43.830 --> 04:27:43.840 align:start position:0%
device their computers and other gear
 
04:27:44.950 --> 04:27:44.960 align:start position:0%
with them what they trap when they
 
04:27:46.389 --> 04:27:46.399 align:start position:0%
travel and rent the heavy and more
 
04:27:47.990 --> 04:27:48.000 align:start position:0%
interchangeable tanks when they arrive
 
04:27:49.510 --> 04:27:49.520 align:start position:0%
at their destination
 
04:27:51.910 --> 04:27:51.920 align:start position:0%
so any diver who's using a gps system at
 
04:27:53.670 --> 04:27:53.680 align:start position:0%
home would bring that with them to new
 
04:27:56.149 --> 04:27:56.159 align:start position:0%
hampshire or the caribbean
 
04:27:57.670 --> 04:27:57.680 align:start position:0%
as a background my husband's been a
 
04:27:59.750 --> 04:27:59.760 align:start position:0%
scuba instructor for over 30 years he
 
04:28:01.189 --> 04:28:01.199 align:start position:0%
taught well over a thousand students
 
04:28:03.750 --> 04:28:03.760 align:start position:0%
from open water divers to dive masters
 
04:28:05.429 --> 04:28:05.439 align:start position:0%
and he taught it the largest military
 
04:28:06.950 --> 04:28:06.960 align:start position:0%
outfitter and has experience with
 
04:28:09.269 --> 04:28:09.279 align:start position:0%
technical dives i'm also a scuba diver
 
04:28:11.189 --> 04:28:11.199 align:start position:0%
but i only have a single dive after
 
04:28:13.510 --> 04:28:13.520 align:start position:0%
getting my open water certification i
 
04:28:15.830 --> 04:28:15.840 align:start position:0%
did not call up ocean enterprises in san
 
04:28:17.910 --> 04:28:17.920 align:start position:0%
diego but i was not able to find any
 
04:28:19.429 --> 04:28:19.439 align:start position:0%
information where they rented these
 
04:28:22.070 --> 04:28:22.080 align:start position:0%
devices to any of their customers that
 
04:28:23.750 --> 04:28:23.760 align:start position:0%
was something that was only a purchase
 
04:28:26.870 --> 04:28:26.880 align:start position:0%
basis because this is this is
 
04:28:28.550 --> 04:28:28.560 align:start position:0%
new technology
 
04:28:31.830 --> 04:28:31.840 align:start position:0%
that may or may not help and doesn't
 
04:28:34.389 --> 04:28:34.399 align:start position:0%
solve our greatest problem which is when
 
04:28:37.189 --> 04:28:37.199 align:start position:0%
somebody is lost underneath the water
 
04:28:37.199 --> 04:28:38.070 align:start position:0%
somebody is lost underneath the water
uh

04:28:38.070 --> 04:28:38.080 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:28:39.670 --> 04:28:39.680 align:start position:0%
i feel i feel terribly for this
 
04:28:39.680 --> 04:28:41.030 align:start position:0%
i feel i feel terribly for this
constituent

04:28:41.030 --> 04:28:41.040 align:start position:0%
constituent
 
04:28:43.269 --> 04:28:43.279 align:start position:0%
i wish that there was a solution
 
04:28:45.429 --> 04:28:45.439 align:start position:0%
but mandating a product that'll give a
 
04:28:47.830 --> 04:28:47.840 align:start position:0%
false sense of security doesn't seem the
 
04:28:50.469 --> 04:28:50.479 align:start position:0%
right solution to me and further i do
 
04:28:52.469 --> 04:28:52.479 align:start position:0%
want to know my confusion my testimony
 
04:28:54.149 --> 04:28:54.159 align:start position:0%
was all built upon the idea that this
 
04:28:56.469 --> 04:28:56.479 align:start position:0%
was underwater navigation gear
 
04:28:58.389 --> 04:28:58.399 align:start position:0%
because on my reading of the bill
 
04:29:01.349 --> 04:29:01.359 align:start position:0%
underwater gps equipment to me said
 
04:29:03.670 --> 04:29:03.680 align:start position:0%
navigation so i would suggest that if
 
04:29:05.510 --> 04:29:05.520 align:start position:0%
there's the possibility and if this does
 
04:29:08.790 --> 04:29:08.800 align:start position:0%
move forward um that that representative
 
04:29:11.349 --> 04:29:11.359 align:start position:0%
harb um see if he can also add language
 
04:29:13.910 --> 04:29:13.920 align:start position:0%
that this is a locating device and not a
 
04:29:15.830 --> 04:29:15.840 align:start position:0%
navigation system because adding
 
04:29:19.269 --> 04:29:19.279 align:start position:0%
navigation for um for recreational dives
 
04:29:20.469 --> 04:29:20.479 align:start position:0%
with people unfamiliar with the
 
04:29:23.030 --> 04:29:23.040 align:start position:0%
equipment would be even more hazardous
 
04:29:25.349 --> 04:29:25.359 align:start position:0%
and quite frankly deadly
 
04:29:27.429 --> 04:29:27.439 align:start position:0%
i'm willing to take any questions i've
 
04:29:28.870 --> 04:29:28.880 align:start position:0%
spoken to quite a few experts in this
 
04:29:31.030 --> 04:29:31.040 align:start position:0%
area so hopefully i can help
 
04:29:34.469 --> 04:29:34.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:35.429 --> 04:29:35.439 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:29:37.510 --> 04:29:37.520 align:start position:0%
so you have no questions
 
04:29:37.520 --> 04:29:39.189 align:start position:0%
so you have no questions
no

04:29:39.189 --> 04:29:39.199 align:start position:0%
no
 
04:29:40.229 --> 04:29:40.239 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry
 
04:29:42.550 --> 04:29:42.560 align:start position:0%
you got one represent
 
04:29:44.309 --> 04:29:44.319 align:start position:0%
representative mayville
 
04:29:45.670 --> 04:29:45.680 align:start position:0%
for a question
 
04:29:47.269 --> 04:29:47.279 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
04:29:50.309 --> 04:29:50.319 align:start position:0%
representative leon in your um it sounds
 
04:29:51.910 --> 04:29:51.920 align:start position:0%
like you've done some extensive work and
 
04:29:53.510 --> 04:29:53.520 align:start position:0%
just talking to different providers and
 
04:29:55.670 --> 04:29:55.680 align:start position:0%
your own expertise as a diver with a
 
04:29:57.750 --> 04:29:57.760 align:start position:0%
husband who's clearly an expert
 
04:29:59.750 --> 04:29:59.760 align:start position:0%
do you know of any states that mandate
 
04:30:01.429 --> 04:30:01.439 align:start position:0%
equipment that a sporting merchandiser
 
04:30:01.439 --> 04:30:03.269 align:start position:0%
equipment that a sporting merchandiser
provides

04:30:03.269 --> 04:30:03.279 align:start position:0%
provides
 
04:30:05.349 --> 04:30:05.359 align:start position:0%
uh no i
 
04:30:07.189 --> 04:30:07.199 align:start position:0%
i don't believe so i have a lot more
 
04:30:09.110 --> 04:30:09.120 align:start position:0%
experience as a skydiver than i do as a
 
04:30:10.309 --> 04:30:10.319 align:start position:0%
scuba diver
 
04:30:12.710 --> 04:30:12.720 align:start position:0%
with that it is it is left to the
 
04:30:15.269 --> 04:30:15.279 align:start position:0%
regulatory the self-regulatory agencies
 
04:30:18.630 --> 04:30:18.640 align:start position:0%
like uspa or it would be patty or dan
 
04:30:20.149 --> 04:30:20.159 align:start position:0%
those would be the similar scuba
 
04:30:22.710 --> 04:30:22.720 align:start position:0%
industries they generally have best
 
04:30:24.710 --> 04:30:24.720 align:start position:0%
practices and those are the ones that
 
04:30:26.389 --> 04:30:26.399 align:start position:0%
anybody who takes part in their
 
04:30:26.399 --> 04:30:27.670 align:start position:0%
anybody who takes part in their
insurance

04:30:27.670 --> 04:30:27.680 align:start position:0%
insurance
 
04:30:30.149 --> 04:30:30.159 align:start position:0%
has to follow in order to be covered so
 
04:30:31.269 --> 04:30:31.279 align:start position:0%
this is the sort of thing that would
 
04:30:33.590 --> 04:30:33.600 align:start position:0%
best come out of patty or
 
04:30:35.830 --> 04:30:35.840 align:start position:0%
any of the other competing
 
04:30:42.229 --> 04:30:42.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:43.590 --> 04:30:43.600 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:30:44.790 --> 04:30:44.800 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:30:49.910 --> 04:30:49.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:52.309 --> 04:30:52.319 align:start position:0%
do you have one uh david coyle who wants
 
04:30:56.630 --> 04:30:56.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:58.389 --> 04:30:58.399 align:start position:0%
this witness call thank you very much
 
04:31:00.550 --> 04:31:00.560 align:start position:0%
for your testimony
 
04:31:02.229 --> 04:31:02.239 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:31:06.950 --> 04:31:06.960 align:start position:0%

your position on the bill and how long
you

04:31:45.510 --> 04:31:45.520 align:start position:0%
you
 
04:31:47.269 --> 04:31:47.279 align:start position:0%
wish to speak
 
04:31:50.149 --> 04:31:50.159 align:start position:0%
yup my name is david coyle i own aquatic
 
04:31:52.950 --> 04:31:52.960 align:start position:0%
specialties in merrimack new hampshire
 
04:31:52.960 --> 04:31:53.910 align:start position:0%
specialties in merrimack new hampshire
and

04:31:53.910 --> 04:31:53.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:31:56.469 --> 04:31:56.479 align:start position:0%
i do have some understanding of how gps
 
04:31:58.630 --> 04:31:58.640 align:start position:0%
works underwater as well as what we're
 
04:32:00.149 --> 04:32:00.159 align:start position:0%
using today
 
04:32:03.670 --> 04:32:03.680 align:start position:0%
to be able to have a surface marker buoy
 
04:32:07.349 --> 04:32:07.359 align:start position:0%
is a device that we use is more less
 
04:32:09.910 --> 04:32:09.920 align:start position:0%
expensive for people to be able to have
 
04:32:12.149 --> 04:32:12.159 align:start position:0%
and has come more common to be able to
 
04:32:14.229 --> 04:32:14.239 align:start position:0%
have with you
 
04:32:14.239 --> 04:32:15.510 align:start position:0%
have with you
the

04:32:15.510 --> 04:32:15.520 align:start position:0%

04:32:21.510 --> 04:32:21.520 align:start position:0%
my name is dave i own a product
 
04:32:23.590 --> 04:32:23.600 align:start position:0%
specialties and um how long's about 10
 
04:32:25.030 --> 04:32:25.040 align:start position:0%
minutes i'm sorry
 
04:32:26.950 --> 04:32:26.960 align:start position:0%
how long
 
04:32:28.149 --> 04:32:28.159 align:start position:0%
the um
 
04:32:31.990 --> 04:32:32.000 align:start position:0%
i think a surface marking buoy is a good
 
04:32:33.910 --> 04:32:33.920 align:start position:0%
a way to be able to signal to the
 
04:32:35.910 --> 04:32:35.920 align:start position:0%
surface you can deploy it from your
 
04:32:37.910 --> 04:32:37.920 align:start position:0%
depth it's going to inflate as it goes
 
04:32:40.309 --> 04:32:40.319 align:start position:0%
to the surface it's something that is
 
04:32:43.269 --> 04:32:43.279 align:start position:0%
less expensive that everybody could have
 
04:32:44.950 --> 04:32:44.960 align:start position:0%
to be able to use
 
04:32:49.670 --> 04:32:49.680 align:start position:0%
um and because for the gps gps is use
 
04:32:52.070 --> 04:32:52.080 align:start position:0%
radio waves and it works underwater very
 
04:32:54.469 --> 04:32:54.479 align:start position:0%
much like satellites you need to have
 
04:32:57.110 --> 04:32:57.120 align:start position:0%
three points in a
 
04:32:59.349 --> 04:32:59.359 align:start position:0%
and a device there is a device that
 
04:33:01.429 --> 04:33:01.439 align:start position:0%
would work under water but then you need
 
04:33:03.510 --> 04:33:03.520 align:start position:0%
a transmitter a transmitter that would
 
04:33:05.189 --> 04:33:05.199 align:start position:0%
have to be mounted to a boat or
 
04:33:07.590 --> 04:33:07.600 align:start position:0%
something on the surface now you could
 
04:33:09.510 --> 04:33:09.520 align:start position:0%
mount that to your dive flag to your
 
04:33:12.709 --> 04:33:12.719 align:start position:0%
buoy but if there was something to and
 
04:33:14.551 --> 04:33:14.561 align:start position:0%
eventually happen to somebody you have
 
04:33:17.349 --> 04:33:17.359 align:start position:0%
an unconscious diver a missing diver
 
04:33:19.029 --> 04:33:19.039 align:start position:0%
most likely they're gonna let go of that
 
04:33:19.039 --> 04:33:20.150 align:start position:0%
most likely they're gonna let go of that
buoy

04:33:20.150 --> 04:33:20.160 align:start position:0%
buoy
 
04:33:22.949 --> 04:33:22.959 align:start position:0%
um and then that you'd have you may be
 
04:33:25.429 --> 04:33:25.439 align:start position:0%
able to get back to it from that way um
 
04:33:27.189 --> 04:33:27.199 align:start position:0%
that would probably be the easiest way
 
04:33:28.869 --> 04:33:28.879 align:start position:0%
to locate somebody
 
04:33:30.310 --> 04:33:30.320 align:start position:0%
because the nautiluses are really
 
04:33:32.869 --> 04:33:32.879 align:start position:0%
designed if you get to the surface
 
04:33:34.629 --> 04:33:34.639 align:start position:0%
and originally they had it where you can
 
04:33:36.789 --> 04:33:36.799 align:start position:0%
actually do a two-way radio on them but
 
04:33:39.269 --> 04:33:39.279 align:start position:0%
they have taken that off um so now it's
 
04:33:40.629 --> 04:33:40.639 align:start position:0%
just a beacon
 
04:33:43.109 --> 04:33:43.119 align:start position:0%
um but they um it's a great device it's
 
04:33:46.070 --> 04:33:46.080 align:start position:0%
a it's a good device to have and um
 
04:33:48.390 --> 04:33:48.400 align:start position:0%
i can tell you that i don't have
 
04:33:50.869 --> 04:33:50.879 align:start position:0%
um i can't ask say that anybody has ever
 
04:33:53.349 --> 04:33:53.359 align:start position:0%
actually came in and asked for one um
 
04:33:55.590 --> 04:33:55.600 align:start position:0%
usually if somebody is concerned and
 
04:33:57.109 --> 04:33:57.119 align:start position:0%
wants one of these that they would
 
04:33:58.949 --> 04:33:58.959 align:start position:0%
purchase themselves
 
04:34:00.629 --> 04:34:00.639 align:start position:0%
to have with them
 
04:34:02.390 --> 04:34:02.400 align:start position:0%
the people that do have them it gives
 
04:34:04.470 --> 04:34:04.480 align:start position:0%
them a comfort a
 
04:34:06.551 --> 04:34:06.561 align:start position:0%
sense of comfort while they're
 
04:34:09.429 --> 04:34:09.439 align:start position:0%
on the surface if they were to get um
 
04:34:10.869 --> 04:34:10.879 align:start position:0%
come to the surface and the boat wasn't
 
04:34:13.750 --> 04:34:13.760 align:start position:0%
there um the way they work somebody had
 
04:34:15.750 --> 04:34:15.760 align:start position:0%
asked in the lake if they would work or
 
04:34:16.949 --> 04:34:16.959 align:start position:0%
in the ocean
 
04:34:20.470 --> 04:34:20.480 align:start position:0%
it goes on to a ufh radio and it's going
 
04:34:21.990 --> 04:34:22.000 align:start position:0%
to get picked up in a certain amount of
 
04:34:22.000 --> 04:34:23.269 align:start position:0%
to get picked up in a certain amount of
mileage

04:34:23.269 --> 04:34:23.279 align:start position:0%
mileage
 
04:34:26.310 --> 04:34:26.320 align:start position:0%
so if there's another boat that has a
 
04:34:28.789 --> 04:34:28.799 align:start position:0%
two-way radio on it it would signal to
 
04:34:30.150 --> 04:34:30.160 align:start position:0%
them and then they would be able to be
 
04:34:31.750 --> 04:34:31.760 align:start position:0%
able to pick them up
 
04:34:33.510 --> 04:34:33.520 align:start position:0%
in the case that you're talking about
 
04:34:36.470 --> 04:34:36.480 align:start position:0%
this is underwater and i don't know if
 
04:34:38.070 --> 04:34:38.080 align:start position:0%
that system would work correctly in that
 
04:34:38.080 --> 04:34:39.269 align:start position:0%
that system would work correctly in that
case

04:34:39.269 --> 04:34:39.279 align:start position:0%
case
 
04:34:43.590 --> 04:34:43.600 align:start position:0%
um when we dive we use a um a diver flag
 
04:34:45.429 --> 04:34:45.439 align:start position:0%
um and we do
 
04:34:48.070 --> 04:34:48.080 align:start position:0%
whenever we're diving but also if we
 
04:34:50.070 --> 04:34:50.080 align:start position:0%
have a couple of divers you've got a
 
04:34:52.150 --> 04:34:52.160 align:start position:0%
buddy team you've got one with a flag
 
04:34:55.510 --> 04:34:55.520 align:start position:0%
and the other one is an smb submersible
 
04:34:55.520 --> 04:34:56.709 align:start position:0%
and the other one is an smb submersible
deployment

04:34:56.709 --> 04:34:56.719 align:start position:0%
deployment
 
04:34:58.789 --> 04:34:58.799 align:start position:0%
they can send that to the surface and
 
04:35:00.551 --> 04:35:00.561 align:start position:0%
they would be able to be
 
04:35:02.629 --> 04:35:02.639 align:start position:0%
found that way i think that would be a
 
04:35:02.639 --> 04:35:04.390 align:start position:0%
found that way i think that would be a
better

04:35:04.390 --> 04:35:04.400 align:start position:0%
better
 
04:35:05.830 --> 04:35:05.840 align:start position:0%
answer for this instead of trying to
 
04:35:08.230 --> 04:35:08.240 align:start position:0%
depend on technology something that
 
04:35:09.990 --> 04:35:10.000 align:start position:0%
every diver could have and would be less
 
04:35:12.629 --> 04:35:12.639 align:start position:0%
expensive the question that judd had
 
04:35:15.990 --> 04:35:16.000 align:start position:0%
said is i do have 10 cents of equipment
 
04:35:18.470 --> 04:35:18.480 align:start position:0%
for me to buy the device that would have
 
04:35:20.869 --> 04:35:20.879 align:start position:0%
the control device on the surface and in
 
04:35:22.230 --> 04:35:22.240 align:start position:0%
the water is roughly around three
 
04:35:23.510 --> 04:35:23.520 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars
 
04:35:25.109 --> 04:35:25.119 align:start position:0%
and that would be a big
 
04:35:28.709 --> 04:35:28.719 align:start position:0%
expense for me um the nautilus um would
 
04:35:30.869 --> 04:35:30.879 align:start position:0%
be less expensive but that's still two
 
04:35:32.629 --> 04:35:32.639 align:start position:0%
hundred dollars timestamp
 
04:35:34.869 --> 04:35:34.879 align:start position:0%
uh because i would if this bill was
 
04:35:36.390 --> 04:35:36.400 align:start position:0%
passed i would not want to make sure
 
04:35:38.551 --> 04:35:38.561 align:start position:0%
that i have for every one of them so
 
04:35:40.150 --> 04:35:40.160 align:start position:0%
that i wouldn't be out of the
 
04:35:40.160 --> 04:35:42.709 align:start position:0%
that i wouldn't be out of the
requirements

04:35:42.709 --> 04:35:42.719 align:start position:0%
requirements
 
04:35:42.719 --> 04:35:44.470 align:start position:0%
requirements
um

04:35:44.470 --> 04:35:44.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:35:47.109 --> 04:35:47.119 align:start position:0%
does anybody have any questions for me
 
04:35:48.230 --> 04:35:48.240 align:start position:0%
i'll uh
 
04:35:50.390 --> 04:35:50.400 align:start position:0%
let me find out are there any questions
 
04:35:51.910 --> 04:35:51.920 align:start position:0%
of this witness
 
04:35:52.869 --> 04:35:52.879 align:start position:0%
sir i
 
04:35:57.109 --> 04:35:57.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:58.789 --> 04:35:58.799 align:start position:0%
representative harms
 
04:36:00.949 --> 04:36:00.959 align:start position:0%
uh representative
 
04:36:00.959 --> 04:36:02.551 align:start position:0%
uh representative
uh

04:36:02.551 --> 04:36:02.561 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:36:04.629 --> 04:36:04.639 align:start position:0%
actually technically you cannot ask a
 
04:36:04.639 --> 04:36:06.629 align:start position:0%
actually technically you cannot ask a
question

04:36:06.629 --> 04:36:06.639 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:36:10.150 --> 04:36:10.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:13.109 --> 04:36:13.119 align:start position:0%
you because you are you are a uh a
 
04:36:13.119 --> 04:36:14.390 align:start position:0%
you because you are you are a uh a
witness

witness
 
04:36:16.070 --> 04:36:16.080 align:start position:0%
and uh you're
 
04:36:18.150 --> 04:36:18.160 align:start position:0%
the presenter of the bill so your is
 
04:36:19.189 --> 04:36:19.199 align:start position:0%
only for
 
04:36:21.670 --> 04:36:21.680 align:start position:0%
the only ones people the only
 
04:36:24.150 --> 04:36:24.160 align:start position:0%
representatives who can ask questions
 
04:36:26.310 --> 04:36:26.320 align:start position:0%
are those who are
 
04:36:29.029 --> 04:36:29.039 align:start position:0%
uh sitting on the committee for the for
 
04:36:30.709 --> 04:36:30.719 align:start position:0%
this hearing
 
04:36:33.189 --> 04:36:33.199 align:start position:0%
uh is there anyone else uh
 
04:36:35.269 --> 04:36:35.279 align:start position:0%
represent representative gunski thank
 
04:36:36.629 --> 04:36:36.639 align:start position:0%
you mr chairman
 
04:36:36.639 --> 04:36:37.830 align:start position:0%
you mr chairman
uh

04:36:37.830 --> 04:36:37.840 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:36:39.990 --> 04:36:40.000 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my call uh call
 
04:36:41.429 --> 04:36:41.439 align:start position:0%
sorry please
 
04:36:43.990 --> 04:36:44.000 align:start position:0%
my question mr coyle
 
04:36:45.750 --> 04:36:45.760 align:start position:0%
i when i researched this particular
 
04:36:47.189 --> 04:36:47.199 align:start position:0%
subject matter
 
04:36:50.150 --> 04:36:50.160 align:start position:0%
i was told that it was common
 
04:36:50.160 --> 04:36:50.949 align:start position:0%
i was told that it was common
or

04:36:50.949 --> 04:36:50.959 align:start position:0%
or
 
04:36:53.349 --> 04:36:53.359 align:start position:0%
it is used at times where an individual
 
04:36:55.990 --> 04:36:56.000 align:start position:0%
would put a cell phone on their buoy
 
04:36:57.830 --> 04:36:57.840 align:start position:0%
or they are the flag
 
04:37:00.629 --> 04:37:00.639 align:start position:0%
buoy in like a waterproof
 
04:37:02.070 --> 04:37:02.080 align:start position:0%
uh bag
 
04:37:03.429 --> 04:37:03.439 align:start position:0%
is that something that you're familiar
 
04:37:05.189 --> 04:37:05.199 align:start position:0%
with i just was looking for a little bit
 
04:37:06.709 --> 04:37:06.719 align:start position:0%
more information on that you know
 
04:37:07.910 --> 04:37:07.920 align:start position:0%
because with the cell phone i guess
 
04:37:09.590 --> 04:37:09.600 align:start position:0%
there's gps technology within the cell
 
04:37:11.269 --> 04:37:11.279 align:start position:0%
phone and certain individuals that use
 
04:37:11.279 --> 04:37:12.070 align:start position:0%
phone and certain individuals that use
that

04:37:12.070 --> 04:37:12.080 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:37:15.029 --> 04:37:15.039 align:start position:0%
to locate themselves or that that buoy
 
04:37:16.869 --> 04:37:16.879 align:start position:0%
you could leave it on the surface and if
 
04:37:18.310 --> 04:37:18.320 align:start position:0%
you're able to come to the surface and
 
04:37:21.029 --> 04:37:21.039 align:start position:0%
be able to turn it on um and to be able
 
04:37:24.310 --> 04:37:24.320 align:start position:0%
to set your gps um there are um some
 
04:37:26.070 --> 04:37:26.080 align:start position:0%
apps that work really well
 
04:37:29.269 --> 04:37:29.279 align:start position:0%
to be able to pinpoint your um place uh
 
04:37:31.029 --> 04:37:31.039 align:start position:0%
we you generally use that if you find
 
04:37:32.310 --> 04:37:32.320 align:start position:0%
something and you want to be able to go
 
04:37:35.429 --> 04:37:35.439 align:start position:0%
back to it um you could set it as a gps
 
04:37:37.029 --> 04:37:37.039 align:start position:0%
to be able to get back to it by using
 
04:37:39.510 --> 04:37:39.520 align:start position:0%
your phone um making sure that you had
 
04:37:42.551 --> 04:37:42.561 align:start position:0%
your phone inside a waterproof
 
04:37:42.561 --> 04:37:43.590 align:start position:0%
your phone inside a waterproof
container

04:37:43.590 --> 04:37:43.600 align:start position:0%
container
 
04:37:47.830 --> 04:37:47.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:49.830 --> 04:37:49.840 align:start position:0%
not get destroyed
 
04:37:49.840 --> 04:37:50.869 align:start position:0%
not get destroyed
okay

04:37:50.869 --> 04:37:50.879 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:37:53.349 --> 04:37:53.359 align:start position:0%
thank you sir appreciate your answer
 
04:37:56.551 --> 04:37:56.561 align:start position:0%
so i see no further questions
 
04:38:00.789 --> 04:38:00.799 align:start position:0%

and dunbarton
 
04:59:22.470 --> 04:59:22.480 align:start position:0%
and i'm here today bringing you this
 
04:59:24.788 --> 04:59:24.798 align:start position:0%
bill actually on behalf of a constituent
 
04:59:27.270 --> 04:59:27.280 align:start position:0%
by the name of sandy crystal who i know
 
04:59:29.190 --> 04:59:29.200 align:start position:0%
has signed up to speak on this bill as
 
04:59:29.200 --> 04:59:30.390 align:start position:0%
has signed up to speak on this bill as
well

04:59:30.390 --> 04:59:30.400 align:start position:0%
well
 
04:59:32.788 --> 04:59:32.798 align:start position:0%
um so i want to tell you a little bit
 
04:59:34.470 --> 04:59:34.480 align:start position:0%
about why this bill is before you
 
04:59:36.788 --> 04:59:36.798 align:start position:0%
because it seems to be creating a great
 
04:59:38.470 --> 04:59:38.480 align:start position:0%
deal of opposition
 
04:59:41.030 --> 04:59:41.040 align:start position:0%
um the bill came to my attention because
 
04:59:44.150 --> 04:59:44.160 align:start position:0%
there is a smallish about 50 acre pond
 
04:59:45.910 --> 04:59:45.920 align:start position:0%
in my town
 
04:59:49.030 --> 04:59:49.040 align:start position:0%
that is used regularly it's got a very
 
04:59:51.430 --> 04:59:51.440 align:start position:0%
tight neighborhood that abuts the pond
 
04:59:53.270 --> 04:59:53.280 align:start position:0%
and lately there are vehicles not
 
04:59:55.030 --> 04:59:55.040 align:start position:0%
snowmobiles but other vehicles that have
 
04:59:57.110 --> 04:59:57.120 align:start position:0%
taken to racing out there and it's
 
04:59:58.788 --> 04:59:58.798 align:start position:0%
making it difficult for the other
 
05:00:00.788 --> 05:00:00.798 align:start position:0%
members of the community to use the pond
 
05:00:02.150 --> 05:00:02.160 align:start position:0%
when they're out there racing which
 
05:00:04.390 --> 05:00:04.400 align:start position:0%
apparently is fairly frequent
 
05:00:07.270 --> 05:00:07.280 align:start position:0%
so the request was that i would put in a
 
05:00:10.070 --> 05:00:10.080 align:start position:0%
bill that could begin to address this
 
05:00:12.470 --> 05:00:12.480 align:start position:0%
well recognizing that
 
05:00:14.310 --> 05:00:14.320 align:start position:0%
different communities have different
 
05:00:17.030 --> 05:00:17.040 align:start position:0%
needs i chose to create a local option
 
05:00:17.040 --> 05:00:17.910 align:start position:0%
needs i chose to create a local option
bill

05:00:17.910 --> 05:00:17.920 align:start position:0%
bill
 
05:00:19.030 --> 05:00:19.040 align:start position:0%
that creates
 
05:00:21.190 --> 05:00:21.200 align:start position:0%
allows the local communities to regulate
 
05:00:24.310 --> 05:00:24.320 align:start position:0%
the time place and manner of the use of
 
05:00:27.670 --> 05:00:27.680 align:start position:0%
frozen bodies of water and
 
05:00:29.910 --> 05:00:29.920 align:start position:0%
the bill applies to
 
05:00:33.110 --> 05:00:33.120 align:start position:0%
all public waters a public water is i'm
 
05:00:34.868 --> 05:00:34.878 align:start position:0%
sorry the bill applies to anything 100
 
05:00:36.150 --> 05:00:36.160 align:start position:0%
acres or less
 
05:00:38.070 --> 05:00:38.080 align:start position:0%
and anything that is solely contained
 
05:00:40.628 --> 05:00:40.638 align:start position:0%
within one town because i didn't want to
 
05:00:43.110 --> 05:00:43.120 align:start position:0%
create a situation where you had dueling
 
05:00:45.510 --> 05:00:45.520 align:start position:0%
towns trying to disagree over the use of
 
05:00:47.030 --> 05:00:47.040 align:start position:0%
the body of water that straddled more
 
05:00:48.628 --> 05:00:48.638 align:start position:0%
than one community
 
05:00:50.708 --> 05:00:50.718 align:start position:0%
at 100 acres or less my intent was to
 
05:00:52.390 --> 05:00:52.400 align:start position:0%
avoid all the larger bodies of water
 
05:00:53.830 --> 05:00:53.840 align:start position:0%
like the lakes but just the smaller
 
05:00:57.270 --> 05:00:57.280 align:start position:0%
ponds contained within communities
 
05:00:59.110 --> 05:00:59.120 align:start position:0%
i also recognize that the needs of
 
05:01:00.470 --> 05:01:00.480 align:start position:0%
different parts of the state are
 
05:01:02.470 --> 05:01:02.480 align:start position:0%
different that in northern new hampshire
 
05:01:04.390 --> 05:01:04.400 align:start position:0%
where they encourage this kind of use of
 
05:01:05.990 --> 05:01:06.000 align:start position:0%
their land and their frozen bodies of
 
05:01:08.390 --> 05:01:08.400 align:start position:0%
water is different than more congested
 
05:01:10.390 --> 05:01:10.400 align:start position:0%
parts of the southern part of the state
 
05:01:10.400 --> 05:01:11.270 align:start position:0%
parts of the southern part of the state
where

05:01:11.270 --> 05:01:11.280 align:start position:0%
where
 
05:01:13.110 --> 05:01:13.120 align:start position:0%
housing is more dense people are more
 
05:01:15.990 --> 05:01:16.000 align:start position:0%
closely there and use of a frozen body
 
05:01:18.708 --> 05:01:18.718 align:start position:0%
by various motorized vehicles um could
 
05:01:20.470 --> 05:01:20.480 align:start position:0%
really create a local problem for the
 
05:01:22.628 --> 05:01:22.638 align:start position:0%
neighborhood so rather than trying
 
05:01:25.030 --> 05:01:25.040 align:start position:0%
establish some sort of standard myself i
 
05:01:26.868 --> 05:01:26.878 align:start position:0%
thought it more appropriate to set up a
 
05:01:28.230 --> 05:01:28.240 align:start position:0%
local option
 
05:01:29.910 --> 05:01:29.920 align:start position:0%
where people or each community could
 
05:01:31.670 --> 05:01:31.680 align:start position:0%
decide what it's right for them and
 
05:01:33.670 --> 05:01:33.680 align:start position:0%
their with respect to their frozen body
 
05:01:35.270 --> 05:01:35.280 align:start position:0%
of water
 
05:01:35.280 --> 05:01:36.550 align:start position:0%
of water
um

05:01:36.550 --> 05:01:36.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:01:38.470 --> 05:01:38.480 align:start position:0%
traditionally public bodies of water
 
05:01:40.708 --> 05:01:40.718 align:start position:0%
which is what this governs and public
 
05:01:42.708 --> 05:01:42.718 align:start position:0%
bodies of water anything that's 10 acres
 
05:01:44.868 --> 05:01:44.878 align:start position:0%
or more and there are hundreds of them
 
05:01:47.750 --> 05:01:47.760 align:start position:0%
in the state the des has a list of them
 
05:01:51.270 --> 05:01:51.280 align:start position:0%
traditionally they are regulated by
 
05:01:53.590 --> 05:01:53.600 align:start position:0%
fish and game and by the marine patrol
 
05:01:55.110 --> 05:01:55.120 align:start position:0%
and they regulate things like speed
 
05:01:57.030 --> 05:01:57.040 align:start position:0%
limits and safety
 
05:01:59.110 --> 05:01:59.120 align:start position:0%
but those kinds of regulations are
 
05:02:00.948 --> 05:02:00.958 align:start position:0%
inadequate to address the issues that
 
05:02:03.030 --> 05:02:03.040 align:start position:0%
have been brought to my attention
 
05:02:05.430 --> 05:02:05.440 align:start position:0%
so this is how we came to come up with
 
05:02:07.510 --> 05:02:07.520 align:start position:0%
this solution for it
 
05:02:07.520 --> 05:02:08.390 align:start position:0%
this solution for it
um

05:02:08.390 --> 05:02:08.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:02:10.628 --> 05:02:10.638 align:start position:0%
i have the unusual advantage of having
 
05:02:12.070 --> 05:02:12.080 align:start position:0%
been copied out quite a bit of the
 
05:02:13.670 --> 05:02:13.680 align:start position:0%
opposition of this bill before it
 
05:02:16.070 --> 05:02:16.080 align:start position:0%
reached me so i want to take a moment to
 
05:02:17.750 --> 05:02:17.760 align:start position:0%
address briefly a couple of the things
 
05:02:19.990 --> 05:02:20.000 align:start position:0%
that i know are coming your way
 
05:02:21.830 --> 05:02:21.840 align:start position:0%
um the first group that reached out to
 
05:02:23.590 --> 05:02:23.600 align:start position:0%
me that's opposing this bill is the
 
05:02:26.390 --> 05:02:26.400 align:start position:0%
department of environmental services um
 
05:02:28.948 --> 05:02:28.958 align:start position:0%
they said that um they were concerned
 
05:02:31.430 --> 05:02:31.440 align:start position:0%
with water quality that was never a
 
05:02:33.190 --> 05:02:33.200 align:start position:0%
concern of ours it was never an issue
 
05:02:34.628 --> 05:02:34.638 align:start position:0%
and i'm not quite sure why that's in
 
05:02:36.550 --> 05:02:36.560 align:start position:0%
their their issue
 
05:02:36.560 --> 05:02:38.868 align:start position:0%
their their issue
um

05:02:38.868 --> 05:02:38.878 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:02:41.110 --> 05:02:41.120 align:start position:0%
they also wanted to talk about that this
 
05:02:43.910 --> 05:02:43.920 align:start position:0%
is inconsistent with um a long-time
 
05:02:46.070 --> 05:02:46.080 align:start position:0%
statewide practice on
 
05:02:47.910 --> 05:02:47.920 align:start position:0%
public bodies of water and they cite
 
05:02:50.708 --> 05:02:50.718 align:start position:0%
common law as if common law prevails
 
05:02:52.390 --> 05:02:52.400 align:start position:0%
here and prevents the legislature from
 
05:02:53.590 --> 05:02:53.600 align:start position:0%
doing something
 
05:02:55.830 --> 05:02:55.840 align:start position:0%
i'm a lawyer and i can tell you that you
 
05:02:58.550 --> 05:02:58.560 align:start position:0%
learn early on in law school that common
 
05:03:01.110 --> 05:03:01.120 align:start position:0%
law is case law that kind of fills in
 
05:03:03.350 --> 05:03:03.360 align:start position:0%
the gaps when there's no statute but it
 
05:03:05.430 --> 05:03:05.440 align:start position:0%
never prevents the legislature from
 
05:03:07.990 --> 05:03:08.000 align:start position:0%
creating a statute to address an issue
 
05:03:10.550 --> 05:03:10.560 align:start position:0%
legislative actions always prevail over
 
05:03:13.030 --> 05:03:13.040 align:start position:0%
common law
 
05:03:15.110 --> 05:03:15.120 align:start position:0%
while there is a law addressing public
 
05:03:15.120 --> 05:03:16.070 align:start position:0%
while there is a law addressing public
waters

05:03:16.070 --> 05:03:16.080 align:start position:0%
waters
 
05:03:17.830 --> 05:03:17.840 align:start position:0%
again there is nothing that addresses
 
05:03:20.390 --> 05:03:20.400 align:start position:0%
this particular issue
 
05:03:22.470 --> 05:03:22.480 align:start position:0%
the rivers management committee they
 
05:03:24.708 --> 05:03:24.718 align:start position:0%
wanted the state to define permissible
 
05:03:24.718 --> 05:03:25.750 align:start position:0%
wanted the state to define permissible
uses

05:03:25.750 --> 05:03:25.760 align:start position:0%
uses
 
05:03:27.750 --> 05:03:27.760 align:start position:0%
which is a nice idea but the reality is
 
05:03:29.510 --> 05:03:29.520 align:start position:0%
is that permissible uses vary from
 
05:03:31.750 --> 05:03:31.760 align:start position:0%
community to community and it really is
 
05:03:33.110 --> 05:03:33.120 align:start position:0%
not one thing i think is a
 
05:03:36.070 --> 05:03:36.080 align:start position:0%
one-size-fits-all for the state
 
05:03:38.628 --> 05:03:38.638 align:start position:0%
the snowmobile association had a concern
 
05:03:40.470 --> 05:03:40.480 align:start position:0%
that i can understand they were
 
05:03:41.990 --> 05:03:42.000 align:start position:0%
concerned that it was going to create a
 
05:03:44.470 --> 05:03:44.480 align:start position:0%
patchwork of what frozen bodies of water
 
05:03:46.788 --> 05:03:46.798 align:start position:0%
were available for use and that when
 
05:03:50.390 --> 05:03:50.400 align:start position:0%
people turn to the state bureau of maps
 
05:03:52.550 --> 05:03:52.560 align:start position:0%
they would not be able to tell which one
 
05:03:54.868 --> 05:03:54.878 align:start position:0%
was um required or which one was limited
 
05:03:56.310 --> 05:03:56.320 align:start position:0%
and which one wasn't
 
05:03:58.550 --> 05:03:58.560 align:start position:0%
to that and there are two solutions one
 
05:04:01.590 --> 05:04:01.600 align:start position:0%
is i put in the bill that um a town
 
05:04:03.590 --> 05:04:03.600 align:start position:0%
would need to post it so if somebody got
 
05:04:05.510 --> 05:04:05.520 align:start position:0%
there they would have some idea that
 
05:04:07.830 --> 05:04:07.840 align:start position:0%
that body was posted and frankly if
 
05:04:09.190 --> 05:04:09.200 align:start position:0%
they're just worried about the state
 
05:04:11.510 --> 05:04:11.520 align:start position:0%
bureau of land and trails not knowing
 
05:04:13.830 --> 05:04:13.840 align:start position:0%
which bodies of water are limited you
 
05:04:15.670 --> 05:04:15.680 align:start position:0%
could put a requirement in the bill that
 
05:04:17.270 --> 05:04:17.280 align:start position:0%
any town that puts any kind of
 
05:04:19.190 --> 05:04:19.200 align:start position:0%
restriction on it has to notify the
 
05:04:20.708 --> 05:04:20.718 align:start position:0%
bureau of land and trails so that
 
05:04:22.390 --> 05:04:22.400 align:start position:0%
they're aware of it and they can note it
 
05:04:24.550 --> 05:04:24.560 align:start position:0%
on their maps
 
05:04:26.948 --> 05:04:26.958 align:start position:0%
um it's very clear from the opposition
 
05:04:29.350 --> 05:04:29.360 align:start position:0%
that comes up but this is not a perfect
 
05:04:29.360 --> 05:04:30.470 align:start position:0%
that comes up but this is not a perfect
solution

05:04:30.470 --> 05:04:30.480 align:start position:0%
solution
 
05:04:33.270 --> 05:04:33.280 align:start position:0%
but the reality is motorized vehicles
 
05:04:34.868 --> 05:04:34.878 align:start position:0%
are a problem
 
05:04:37.590 --> 05:04:37.600 align:start position:0%
generally not slow snowmobiles generally
 
05:04:39.270 --> 05:04:39.280 align:start position:0%
other kinds of motorized vehicles that
 
05:04:41.270 --> 05:04:41.280 align:start position:0%
are out on the frozen bodies of water in
 
05:04:42.550 --> 05:04:42.560 align:start position:0%
our state
 
05:04:45.670 --> 05:04:45.680 align:start position:0%
by creating a local option bill
 
05:04:47.670 --> 05:04:47.680 align:start position:0%
this allows the issues to be addressed
 
05:04:49.430 --> 05:04:49.440 align:start position:0%
in a manner that fits with the unique
 
05:04:52.628 --> 05:04:52.638 align:start position:0%
needs of each community in this state
 
05:04:54.470 --> 05:04:54.480 align:start position:0%
and so that's why i created this bill
 
05:04:58.470 --> 05:04:58.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:00.470 --> 05:05:00.480 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions by members of
 
05:05:06.550 --> 05:05:06.560 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:08.868 --> 05:05:08.878 align:start position:0%
you're all easy
 
05:05:10.628 --> 05:05:10.638 align:start position:0%
there are no questions thank you very
 
05:05:13.590 --> 05:05:13.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:16.310 --> 05:05:16.320 align:start position:0%
uh you chair recognizes uh
 
05:05:18.948 --> 05:05:18.958 align:start position:0%
captain eastman from fish and game
 
05:05:21.030 --> 05:05:21.040 align:start position:0%

uh
 
05:05:23.910 --> 05:05:23.920 align:start position:0%
my department has some multiple concerns
 
05:05:25.830 --> 05:05:25.840 align:start position:0%
about this uh bill
 
05:05:27.670 --> 05:05:27.680 align:start position:0%
um i think you might want to speak
 
05:05:27.680 --> 05:05:30.470 align:start position:0%
um i think you might want to speak
louder

05:05:30.470 --> 05:05:30.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:33.190 --> 05:05:33.200 align:start position:0%
yes uh michael eastman uh captain of
 
05:05:36.868 --> 05:05:36.878 align:start position:0%
fish and game my department has multiple
 
05:05:39.430 --> 05:05:39.440 align:start position:0%
issues with this bill
 
05:05:43.110 --> 05:05:43.120 align:start position:0%
um obviously rsa 271 120
 
05:05:45.750 --> 05:05:45.760 align:start position:0%
which is the public bodies of water law
 
05:05:48.070 --> 05:05:48.080 align:start position:0%
states that these are
 
05:05:50.708 --> 05:05:50.718 align:start position:0%
public places for all
 
05:05:51.990 --> 05:05:52.000 align:start position:0%
people to
 
05:05:52.000 --> 05:05:54.708 align:start position:0%
people to
recreate

05:05:54.708 --> 05:05:54.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:56.470 --> 05:05:56.480 align:start position:0%
the concerns that we have is that it
 
05:05:59.030 --> 05:05:59.040 align:start position:0%
would uh create confusion uh to the
 
05:06:02.310 --> 05:06:02.320 align:start position:0%
public uh two different laws and
 
05:06:02.320 --> 05:06:03.510 align:start position:0%
public uh two different laws and
ordinances

05:06:03.510 --> 05:06:03.520 align:start position:0%
ordinances
 
05:06:05.350 --> 05:06:05.360 align:start position:0%
from town to town
 
05:06:08.470 --> 05:06:08.480 align:start position:0%
in those bodies of water
 
05:06:11.430 --> 05:06:11.440 align:start position:0%
state enforcement um if uh if a town
 
05:06:12.628 --> 05:06:12.638 align:start position:0%
opted in
 
05:06:13.830 --> 05:06:13.840 align:start position:0%
uh to
 
05:06:16.230 --> 05:06:16.240 align:start position:0%
uh have different controls on these
 
05:06:18.868 --> 05:06:18.878 align:start position:0%
state bodies of water that uh state
 
05:06:20.948 --> 05:06:20.958 align:start position:0%
enforcement could not enforce those
 
05:06:23.990 --> 05:06:24.000 align:start position:0%
ordinances we did not enforce
 
05:06:26.788 --> 05:06:26.798 align:start position:0%
town or or city ordinances
 
05:06:28.868 --> 05:06:28.878 align:start position:0%
municipal law enforcement would be
 
05:06:28.878 --> 05:06:30.310 align:start position:0%
municipal law enforcement would be
responsible

05:06:30.310 --> 05:06:30.320 align:start position:0%
responsible
 
05:06:33.350 --> 05:06:33.360 align:start position:0%
putting unreasonable burden or placing
 
05:06:37.190 --> 05:06:37.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:38.868 --> 05:06:38.878 align:start position:0%
it could be detrimental to local
 
05:06:41.030 --> 05:06:41.040 align:start position:0%
economies um as well
 
05:06:44.150 --> 05:06:44.160 align:start position:0%
and as well uh it would uh it is unclear
 
05:06:46.948 --> 05:06:46.958 align:start position:0%
in the way the bill was written that um
 
05:06:49.430 --> 05:06:49.440 align:start position:0%
if my department would be excused from
 
05:06:51.750 --> 05:06:51.760 align:start position:0%
search and rescue responsibilities
 
05:06:54.868 --> 05:06:54.878 align:start position:0%
on those bodies of water as well
 
05:07:00.550 --> 05:07:00.560 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:00.560 --> 05:07:01.830 align:start position:0%
 
testimony

05:07:01.830 --> 05:07:01.840 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
05:07:03.910 --> 05:07:03.920 align:start position:0%
which is a little more in depth but i
 
05:07:06.708 --> 05:07:06.718 align:start position:0%
believe that that hits all of the parts
 
05:07:07.590 --> 05:07:07.600 align:start position:0%
of our
 
05:07:10.708 --> 05:07:10.718 align:start position:0%
testimony in writing and we would please
 
05:07:12.948 --> 05:07:12.958 align:start position:0%
ask the committee to find this expedient
 
05:07:15.430 --> 05:07:15.440 align:start position:0%
to legacy
 
05:07:18.150 --> 05:07:18.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:20.070 --> 05:07:20.080 align:start position:0%
is there any question by members of the
 
05:07:20.080 --> 05:07:26.070 align:start position:0%
is there any question by members of the
committee

05:07:26.070 --> 05:07:26.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:28.868 --> 05:07:28.878 align:start position:0%
no question sir you have one question
 
05:07:30.470 --> 05:07:30.480 align:start position:0%
representative post
 
05:07:33.430 --> 05:07:33.440 align:start position:0%
uh representative post for a question
 
05:07:35.110 --> 05:07:35.120 align:start position:0%
yes i'm sorry i didn't catch the
 
05:07:36.868 --> 05:07:36.878 align:start position:0%
speaker's name
 
05:07:38.310 --> 05:07:38.320 align:start position:0%
who's testifying
 
05:07:40.868 --> 05:07:40.878 align:start position:0%
captain eastman from the fish and game
 
05:07:40.878 --> 05:07:42.150 align:start position:0%
captain eastman from the fish and game
department

05:07:42.150 --> 05:07:42.160 align:start position:0%
department
 
05:07:45.030 --> 05:07:45.040 align:start position:0%
yes thank you very much um i i would
 
05:07:46.550 --> 05:07:46.560 align:start position:0%
like to know
 
05:07:50.150 --> 05:07:50.160 align:start position:0%
if there is a fiscal cost to you
 
05:07:52.470 --> 05:07:52.480 align:start position:0%
um if this bill goes through to the fish
 
05:07:55.590 --> 05:07:55.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:57.110 --> 05:07:57.120 align:start position:0%
thank you representative post i know of
 
05:07:58.708 --> 05:07:58.718 align:start position:0%
no fiscal cost
 
05:07:59.910 --> 05:07:59.920 align:start position:0%
once again
 
05:08:02.550 --> 05:08:02.560 align:start position:0%
it's unclear if it would uh reduce
 
05:08:05.350 --> 05:08:05.360 align:start position:0%
search and rescue responsibilities
 
05:08:08.150 --> 05:08:08.160 align:start position:0%
and if this was under any municipal
 
05:08:10.390 --> 05:08:10.400 align:start position:0%
control would need to be handled by that
 
05:08:10.400 --> 05:08:12.070 align:start position:0%
control would need to be handled by that
municipality

05:08:12.070 --> 05:08:12.080 align:start position:0%
municipality
 
05:08:13.750 --> 05:08:13.760 align:start position:0%
and could not be enforced by state
 
05:08:13.760 --> 05:08:17.830 align:start position:0%
and could not be enforced by state
enforcement

05:08:17.830 --> 05:08:17.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:19.590 --> 05:08:19.600 align:start position:0%
thank you very much that answers your
 
05:08:19.600 --> 05:08:20.550 align:start position:0%
thank you very much that answers your
question

05:08:20.550 --> 05:08:20.560 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:08:20.560 --> 05:08:22.948 align:start position:0%
question
smith

05:08:22.948 --> 05:08:22.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:25.510 --> 05:08:25.520 align:start position:0%
representative smith for question
 
05:08:27.910 --> 05:08:27.920 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and welcome back to
 
05:08:30.628 --> 05:08:30.638 align:start position:0%
resources captain eastman nice to not
 
05:08:33.110 --> 05:08:33.120 align:start position:0%
see you again i mean because we're on
 
05:08:35.190 --> 05:08:35.200 align:start position:0%
zoom um
 
05:08:39.670 --> 05:08:39.680 align:start position:0%
you you uh talked about rsa 271 120
 
05:08:42.470 --> 05:08:42.480 align:start position:0%
about public waters and the sponsor of
 
05:08:45.110 --> 05:08:45.120 align:start position:0%
the bill talked about the pub waters
 
05:08:47.190 --> 05:08:47.200 align:start position:0%
held in the public trust only being part
 
05:08:49.030 --> 05:08:49.040 align:start position:0%
of common law
 
05:08:51.750 --> 05:08:51.760 align:start position:0%
are those two conflicting things or do
 
05:08:53.430 --> 05:08:53.440 align:start position:0%
they cover two completely different
 
05:08:56.830 --> 05:08:56.840 align:start position:0%
things to the best of your knowledge
 
05:09:00.868 --> 05:09:00.878 align:start position:0%
um i am unsure uh if they're covering a
 
05:09:03.750 --> 05:09:03.760 align:start position:0%
common law i know that um
 
05:09:06.708 --> 05:09:06.718 align:start position:0%
it's rsa 271 20

i live walking distance from turry pond
 
05:11:08.948 --> 05:11:08.958 align:start position:0%
a 47-acre natural lake
 
05:11:11.670 --> 05:11:11.680 align:start position:0%
with the fish and game boat access
 
05:11:15.190 --> 05:11:15.200 align:start position:0%
toury pond is used by kayakers
 
05:11:17.270 --> 05:11:17.280 align:start position:0%
and small boats as there are limits on
 
05:11:19.670 --> 05:11:19.680 align:start position:0%
horsepower and speed when the pond has
 
05:11:21.270 --> 05:11:21.280 align:start position:0%
opened water
 
05:11:24.230 --> 05:11:24.240 align:start position:0%
in the winter a frozen turry pond hosts
 
05:11:26.310 --> 05:11:26.320 align:start position:0%
snowmobile trails that cross from
 
05:11:28.470 --> 05:11:28.480 align:start position:0%
town-owned conservation land to trails
 
05:11:30.868 --> 05:11:30.878 align:start position:0%
across the pond i spent much time
 
05:11:32.868 --> 05:11:32.878 align:start position:0%
snowshoeing cross-country skiing or just
 
05:11:35.190 --> 05:11:35.200 align:start position:0%
walking the frozen pond especially the
 
05:11:37.030 --> 05:11:37.040 align:start position:0%
shoreline appreciating the hab the
 
05:11:38.788 --> 05:11:38.798 align:start position:0%
wildlife for its signs
 
05:11:40.948 --> 05:11:40.958 align:start position:0%
and its unique vegetation of the
 
05:11:43.350 --> 05:11:43.360 align:start position:0%
adjacent bargain fin habitat
 
05:11:45.110 --> 05:11:45.120 align:start position:0%
characteristics that contribute to it
 
05:11:47.590 --> 05:11:47.600 align:start position:0%
being designated a prime wetland under
 
05:11:50.070 --> 05:11:50.080 align:start position:0%
local and state laws
 
05:11:51.750 --> 05:11:51.760 align:start position:0%
in addition to the use of the pond by
 
05:11:53.830 --> 05:11:53.840 align:start position:0%
snowmobiles numerous people enjoy
 
05:11:56.230 --> 05:11:56.240 align:start position:0%
skating and ice fishing there during a
 
05:11:58.150 --> 05:11:58.160 align:start position:0%
recent visit to the pond quite a number
 
05:11:59.830 --> 05:11:59.840 align:start position:0%
of those individuals ice fishing were
 
05:12:01.270 --> 05:12:01.280 align:start position:0%
young adults
 
05:12:03.270 --> 05:12:03.280 align:start position:0%
the relatively quiet experience of
 
05:12:05.110 --> 05:12:05.120 align:start position:0%
enjoying the pond's winter tranquility
 
05:12:07.670 --> 05:12:07.680 align:start position:0%
is appreciated by all ages
 
05:12:11.350 --> 05:12:11.360 align:start position:0%
in the winter of 2018 to 2019 terry pond
 
05:12:13.670 --> 05:12:13.680 align:start position:0%
became a location in a motorbike racing
 
05:12:13.680 --> 05:12:14.948 align:start position:0%
became a location in a motorbike racing
activities

05:12:14.948 --> 05:12:14.958 align:start position:0%
activities
 
05:12:16.948 --> 05:12:16.958 align:start position:0%
this created a loud and to some
 
05:12:19.510 --> 05:12:19.520 align:start position:0%
obtrusive situation on numerous weekend
 
05:12:19.520 --> 05:12:20.550 align:start position:0%
obtrusive situation on numerous weekend
days

05:12:20.550 --> 05:12:20.560 align:start position:0%
days
 
05:12:22.550 --> 05:12:22.560 align:start position:0%
this disturbed the enjoyable nature of
 
05:12:24.628 --> 05:12:24.638 align:start position:0%
the typical quiet winter activities on
 
05:12:27.590 --> 05:12:27.600 align:start position:0%
the pond some people who are ice fishing
 
05:12:30.788 --> 05:12:30.798 align:start position:0%
left when the outdoor
 
05:12:32.788 --> 05:12:32.798 align:start position:0%
quietude was disturbed by the racing
 
05:12:32.798 --> 05:12:33.910 align:start position:0%
quietude was disturbed by the racing
vehicles

05:12:33.910 --> 05:12:33.920 align:start position:0%
vehicles
 
05:12:35.910 --> 05:12:35.920 align:start position:0%
the noise could be heard more than a
 
05:12:37.590 --> 05:12:37.600 align:start position:0%
half mile away
 
05:12:39.910 --> 05:12:39.920 align:start position:0%
unlike the usual snowmobile
 
05:12:42.868 --> 05:12:42.878 align:start position:0%
travel which is more trail directed
 
05:12:44.788 --> 05:12:44.798 align:start position:0%
there was continuous noise for the
 
05:12:44.798 --> 05:12:46.310 align:start position:0%
there was continuous noise for the
afternoon

05:12:46.310 --> 05:12:46.320 align:start position:0%
afternoon
 
05:12:47.990 --> 05:12:48.000 align:start position:0%
this motorbike activity occurred
 
05:12:50.628 --> 05:12:50.638 align:start position:0%
multiple times in 2019
 
05:12:52.190 --> 05:12:52.200 align:start position:0%
in the winter of
 
05:12:54.788 --> 05:12:54.798 align:start position:0%
2019-2020 the pond was not solidly
 
05:12:57.350 --> 05:12:57.360 align:start position:0%
frozen enough to support the motorbike
 
05:12:59.670 --> 05:12:59.680 align:start position:0%
racing activity
 
05:13:02.070 --> 05:13:02.080 align:start position:0%
a sunny sunday recently found people ice
 
05:13:03.910 --> 05:13:03.920 align:start position:0%
fishing ice skating playing hockey
 
05:13:06.070 --> 05:13:06.080 align:start position:0%
growing hot dogs and snowmobiling family
 
05:13:07.430 --> 05:13:07.440 align:start position:0%
members around
 
05:13:09.110 --> 05:13:09.120 align:start position:0%
i spoke with some people fishing and
 
05:13:12.230 --> 05:13:12.240 align:start position:0%
recreating on the pond several
 
05:13:13.830 --> 05:13:13.840 align:start position:0%
acknowledged that the noise of the
 
05:13:16.390 --> 05:13:16.400 align:start position:0%
motorbike racing activities
 
05:13:18.470 --> 05:13:18.480 align:start position:0%
sets up conflicts
 
05:13:20.390 --> 05:13:20.400 align:start position:0%
one person said that he fishes at turri
 
05:13:22.948 --> 05:13:22.958 align:start position:0%
pond because upon closer to him turkey
 
05:13:26.070 --> 05:13:26.080 align:start position:0%
pond is used for racing doing due to its
 
05:13:28.070 --> 05:13:28.080 align:start position:0%
long straight path
 
05:13:30.390 --> 05:13:30.400 align:start position:0%
my interest in this bill is to provide a
 
05:13:32.470 --> 05:13:32.480 align:start position:0%
means to share the use of the frozen
 
05:13:34.708 --> 05:13:34.718 align:start position:0%
ponds and smaller lakes with some
 
05:13:37.110 --> 05:13:37.120 align:start position:0%
predictability by regulating the time
 
05:13:39.270 --> 05:13:39.280 align:start position:0%
place and manner of use
 
05:13:40.948 --> 05:13:40.958 align:start position:0%
providing authorization to a
 
05:13:43.830 --> 05:13:43.840 align:start position:0%
municipality to regulate noise-creating
 
05:13:46.390 --> 05:13:46.400 align:start position:0%
activities on a pond is consistent with
 
05:13:49.270 --> 05:13:49.280 align:start position:0%
municipal regulation of land uses
 
05:13:51.270 --> 05:13:51.280 align:start position:0%
there is an opportunity for input of
 
05:13:53.670 --> 05:13:53.680 align:start position:0%
residents who may be most affected as
 
05:13:55.750 --> 05:13:55.760 align:start position:0%
well as those who prefer this describe
 
05:13:58.310 --> 05:13:58.320 align:start position:0%
racing or other activities and as with
 
05:14:00.628 --> 05:14:00.638 align:start position:0%
land use regulations often there are
 
05:14:03.270 --> 05:14:03.280 align:start position:0%
compromises something i am familiar with
 
05:14:05.270 --> 05:14:05.280 align:start position:0%
as a member of my town's planning board
 
05:14:06.868 --> 05:14:06.878 align:start position:0%
for many years
 
05:14:08.708 --> 05:14:08.718 align:start position:0%
each community is different and this
 
05:14:10.708 --> 05:14:10.718 align:start position:0%
bill will provide municipalities with
 
05:14:14.070 --> 05:14:14.080 align:start position:0%
choice i encourage you to
 
05:14:17.190 --> 05:14:17.200 align:start position:0%
support hb 534
 
05:14:19.510 --> 05:14:19.520 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman and committee members

representative smith for a question
 
05:14:37.270 --> 05:14:37.280 align:start position:0%
uh yes thank you mr chair and thank you
 
05:14:41.190 --> 05:14:41.200 align:start position:0%
for taking my question miss crystal um
 
05:14:43.750 --> 05:14:43.760 align:start position:0%
how many when the when people are out
 
05:14:46.708 --> 05:14:46.718 align:start position:0%
there on their motorbikes racing around
 
05:14:48.390 --> 05:14:48.400 align:start position:0%
or do they are going are they going
 
05:14:50.788 --> 05:14:50.798 align:start position:0%
around in circles or are they taking up
 
05:14:52.628 --> 05:14:52.638 align:start position:0%
the whole pond
 
05:14:55.830 --> 05:14:55.840 align:start position:0%
yeah usually it has been um and and
 
05:14:57.910 --> 05:14:57.920 align:start position:0%
there hasn't been the activity this
 
05:14:59.670 --> 05:14:59.680 align:start position:0%
winter i think once again the ice has
 
05:15:03.030 --> 05:15:03.040 align:start position:0%
been kind of iffy
 
05:15:05.830 --> 05:15:05.840 align:start position:0%
it's usually it's not the whole pond um
 
05:15:08.230 --> 05:15:08.240 align:start position:0%
there are people who mentioned that they
 
05:15:11.670 --> 05:15:11.680 align:start position:0%
have ice fished while they were
 
05:15:13.750 --> 05:15:13.760 align:start position:0%
basically they create a track and they
 
05:15:16.150 --> 05:15:16.160 align:start position:0%
go around and around on the track which
 
05:15:17.430 --> 05:15:17.440 align:start position:0%
is what makes it different than the
 
05:15:19.590 --> 05:15:19.600 align:start position:0%
snowmobiles that kind of pass through
 
05:15:19.600 --> 05:15:20.550 align:start position:0%
snowmobiles that kind of pass through
and

05:15:20.550 --> 05:15:20.560 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:15:23.990 --> 05:15:24.000 align:start position:0%
and move on thank you mr chair follow-up

05:15:34.390 --> 05:15:34.400 align:start position:0%
i don't know

05:15:37.430 --> 05:15:37.440 align:start position:0%
enough
 
05:15:38.948 --> 05:15:38.958 align:start position:0%
to really um
 
05:15:40.470 --> 05:15:40.480 align:start position:0%
you know
 
05:15:42.310 --> 05:15:42.320 align:start position:0%
take stock of it but there were there
 
05:15:44.390 --> 05:15:44.400 align:start position:0%
were quite a few there is a
 
05:15:46.948 --> 05:15:46.958 align:start position:0%
um a parking area for the boat ramp and
 
05:15:49.510 --> 05:15:49.520 align:start position:0%
the boat ramp is also behind bow high
 
05:15:52.390 --> 05:15:52.400 align:start position:0%
school so there's additional parking
 
05:15:55.110 --> 05:15:55.120 align:start position:0%
there for um
 
05:16:03.750 --> 05:16:03.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:06.150 --> 05:16:06.160 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you miss
 
05:16:08.470 --> 05:16:08.480 align:start position:0%
crystal for being here today um a couple
 
05:16:10.550 --> 05:16:10.560 align:start position:0%
questions um
 
05:16:12.070 --> 05:16:12.080 align:start position:0%
is it my understanding this just
 
05:16:14.070 --> 05:16:14.080 align:start position:0%
happened one year
 
05:16:15.910 --> 05:16:15.920 align:start position:0%
in 2019
 
05:16:18.948 --> 05:16:18.958 align:start position:0%
the first year it happened was um yeah
 
05:16:18.958 --> 05:16:19.708 align:start position:0%
the first year it happened was um yeah
the

05:16:19.708 --> 05:16:19.718 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:16:21.750 --> 05:16:21.760 align:start position:0%
2018-2019 winter
 
05:16:24.230 --> 05:16:24.240 align:start position:0%
and then last winter it was
 
05:16:26.470 --> 05:16:26.480 align:start position:0%
like i said the ice wasn't
 
05:16:26.480 --> 05:16:27.430 align:start position:0%
like i said the ice wasn't
um

05:16:27.430 --> 05:16:27.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:16:29.590 --> 05:16:29.600 align:start position:0%
good enough to
 
05:16:32.070 --> 05:16:32.080 align:start position:0%
for that use it was really iffy in fact
 
05:16:33.910 --> 05:16:33.920 align:start position:0%
i think a couple of snowmobiles went
 
05:16:35.670 --> 05:16:35.680 align:start position:0%
into the went through the ice last
 
05:16:39.430 --> 05:16:39.440 align:start position:0%
winter um so it it uh it it hasn't
 
05:16:39.440 --> 05:16:40.868 align:start position:0%
winter um so it it uh it it hasn't
happened

05:16:40.868 --> 05:16:40.878 align:start position:0%
happened
 
05:16:43.510 --> 05:16:43.520 align:start position:0%
multiple years but i know
 
05:16:47.270 --> 05:16:47.280 align:start position:0%
of things happening at other area ponds
 
05:16:50.230 --> 05:16:50.240 align:start position:0%
um the hearing that follows this
 
05:16:50.240 --> 05:16:51.670 align:start position:0%
um the hearing that follows this
and

05:16:51.670 --> 05:16:51.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:16:51.680 --> 05:16:52.550 align:start position:0%
and
so

05:16:52.550 --> 05:16:52.560 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:16:54.788 --> 05:16:54.798 align:start position:0%
my concern when i had brought it forward
 
05:16:56.550 --> 05:16:56.560 align:start position:0%
you know who knows what the winter is
 
05:16:58.070 --> 05:16:58.080 align:start position:0%
going to be like and
 
05:17:00.948 --> 05:17:00.958 align:start position:0%
you know if it stays cold there will be
 
05:17:03.270 --> 05:17:03.280 align:start position:0%
time for them to come this year but
 
05:17:03.280 --> 05:17:06.230 align:start position:0%
time for them to come this year but
um

05:17:06.230 --> 05:17:06.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:08.390 --> 05:17:08.400 align:start position:0%
it hasn't happened more than that one
 
05:17:11.350 --> 05:17:11.360 align:start position:0%
year that was the year it started
 
05:17:11.360 --> 05:17:12.708 align:start position:0%
year that was the year it started
uh

05:17:12.708 --> 05:17:12.718 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:17:15.190 --> 05:17:15.200 align:start position:0%
mr chairman may i do a follow-up
 
05:17:17.110 --> 05:17:17.120 align:start position:0%
uh for a follow-up
 
05:17:20.390 --> 05:17:20.400 align:start position:0%
uh yes so um miss crystal do you know if
 
05:17:22.868 --> 05:17:22.878 align:start position:0%
there's any regulations during the
 
05:17:25.030 --> 05:17:25.040 align:start position:0%
summer months for boats racing back and
 
05:17:26.868 --> 05:17:26.878 align:start position:0%
forth and things like that yes there
 
05:17:29.750 --> 05:17:29.760 align:start position:0%
there is a 10 10 mile per hour speed
 
05:17:32.390 --> 05:17:32.400 align:start position:0%
limit and a 10 horsepower
 
05:17:32.400 --> 05:17:33.910 align:start position:0%
limit and a 10 horsepower
um

05:17:33.910 --> 05:17:33.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:17:36.390 --> 05:17:36.400 align:start position:0%
limit as well and in fact uh one of the
 
05:17:38.550 --> 05:17:38.560 align:start position:0%
conservation commission members had
 
05:17:41.270 --> 05:17:41.280 align:start position:0%
we contacted marine patrol because uh
 
05:17:43.670 --> 05:17:43.680 align:start position:0%
while the 10 horsepower was
 
05:17:45.990 --> 05:17:46.000 align:start position:0%
on the books there was no sign about
 
05:17:48.070 --> 05:17:48.080 align:start position:0%
that posted so we now have a sign about
 
05:17:52.708 --> 05:17:52.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:55.670 --> 05:17:55.680 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
05:17:58.868 --> 05:17:58.878 align:start position:0%
sir i see no other questions all right
 
05:18:01.270 --> 05:18:01.280 align:start position:0%
being no other questions
 
05:18:02.868 --> 05:18:02.878 align:start position:0%
members of the committee
 
05:18:05.350 --> 05:18:05.360 align:start position:0%

05:18:08.070 --> 05:18:08.080 align:start position:0%

05:18:18.150 --> 05:18:18.160 align:start position:0%
go from the bottom up because they're in
 
05:18:23.110 --> 05:18:23.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:25.030 --> 05:18:25.040 align:start position:0%

05:18:55.350 --> 05:18:55.360 align:start position:0%
okay can you hear me
 
05:18:56.868 --> 05:18:56.878 align:start position:0%
uh yes we can
 
05:19:02.390 --> 05:19:02.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:05.190 --> 05:19:05.200 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for again uh for the
 
05:19:08.070 --> 05:19:08.080 align:start position:0%

jason stock new hampshire timberland
 
05:19:14.390 --> 05:19:14.400 align:start position:0%
owners association and uh i'm here to
 
05:19:17.750 --> 05:19:17.760 align:start position:0%
testify in opposition to house bill 534
 
05:19:20.150 --> 05:19:20.160 align:start position:0%
um simply because
 
05:19:22.948 --> 05:19:22.958 align:start position:0%
if a water body is less than 10 acres
 
05:19:25.750 --> 05:19:25.760 align:start position:0%
it's a it's a private water body
 
05:19:25.760 --> 05:19:26.550 align:start position:0%
it's a it's a private water body
and

05:19:26.550 --> 05:19:26.560 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:19:30.788 --> 05:19:30.798 align:start position:0%
as the bill is written it basically
 
05:19:33.110 --> 05:19:33.120 align:start position:0%
for us there's a little bit of ambiguity
 
05:19:35.270 --> 05:19:35.280 align:start position:0%
because it says that municipalities can
 
05:19:35.280 --> 05:19:36.708 align:start position:0%
because it says that municipalities can
regulate

05:19:36.708 --> 05:19:36.718 align:start position:0%
regulate
 
05:19:39.110 --> 05:19:39.120 align:start position:0%
public waters less than 100 acres and
 
05:19:41.110 --> 05:19:41.120 align:start position:0%
when i spoke to some of my members they
 
05:19:42.550 --> 05:19:42.560 align:start position:0%
said well
 
05:19:44.788 --> 05:19:44.798 align:start position:0%
it would be cleaner if if this were to
 
05:19:46.628 --> 05:19:46.638 align:start position:0%
go if this were to become law it would
 
05:19:48.628 --> 05:19:48.638 align:start position:0%
certainly be cleaner to clarify that
 
05:19:51.510 --> 05:19:51.520 align:start position:0%
it's really 10 between between 10 and
 
05:19:54.150 --> 05:19:54.160 align:start position:0%
10 and 100 acres
 
05:19:55.750 --> 05:19:55.760 align:start position:0%
we do have members that have water
 
05:19:57.910 --> 05:19:57.920 align:start position:0%
bodies on their property
 
05:19:57.920 --> 05:19:58.788 align:start position:0%
bodies on their property
um

05:19:58.788 --> 05:19:58.798 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:19:58.798 --> 05:19:59.590 align:start position:0%
um
and

05:19:59.590 --> 05:19:59.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:20:00.550 --> 05:20:00.560 align:start position:0%
you know
 
05:20:03.510 --> 05:20:03.520 align:start position:0%
frozen uh when they are frozen they they
 
05:20:05.670 --> 05:20:05.680 align:start position:0%
may have occasion to drive drive on them
 
05:20:08.868 --> 05:20:08.878 align:start position:0%
or use you know travel across them and
 
05:20:12.470 --> 05:20:12.480 align:start position:0%
as we've read this it appears that um
 
05:20:14.550 --> 05:20:14.560 align:start position:0%
there could be some ambiguity where a
 
05:20:16.948 --> 05:20:16.958 align:start position:0%
municipality could say look
 
05:20:19.510 --> 05:20:19.520 align:start position:0%
um it's less than 100 acres
 
05:20:22.310 --> 05:20:22.320 align:start position:0%
and we don't feel you should have that
 
05:20:24.948 --> 05:20:24.958 align:start position:0%
ability to travel across it to access
 
05:20:27.270 --> 05:20:27.280 align:start position:0%
your back property so
 
05:20:30.390 --> 05:20:30.400 align:start position:0%
again that was our our principal concern
 
05:20:32.868 --> 05:20:32.878 align:start position:0%
on this bill and i wanted to
 
05:20:34.868 --> 05:20:34.878 align:start position:0%
provide that testimony today just to
 
05:20:37.510 --> 05:20:37.520 align:start position:0%
raise that point that
 
05:20:39.270 --> 05:20:39.280 align:start position:0%
there is that ambiguity in there and i'd
 
05:20:43.430 --> 05:20:43.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:48.550 --> 05:20:48.560 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:50.708 --> 05:20:50.718 align:start position:0%
sir i see no questions
 
05:20:52.628 --> 05:20:52.638 align:start position:0%
seeing no questions
 
05:20:54.550 --> 05:20:54.560 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your testimony
 
05:20:55.990 --> 05:20:56.000 align:start position:0%
thank you

05:22:08.550 --> 05:22:08.560 align:start position:0%
this includes revenue derived from

licensed sales and taxes upon sporting

ice fishing is a time-honored tradition
 
05:22:26.550 --> 05:22:26.560 align:start position:0%
uh you know i know that many of you know
 
05:22:28.550 --> 05:22:28.560 align:start position:0%
enjoyed by sportsman moment throughout
 
05:22:31.110 --> 05:22:31.120 align:start position:0%
all of new hampshire and by purchasing
 
05:22:33.670 --> 05:22:33.680 align:start position:0%
the necessary licenses and equipment
 
05:22:35.910 --> 05:22:35.920 align:start position:0%
these anglers are contributing uh
 
05:22:38.230 --> 05:22:38.240 align:start position:0%
valuable much-needed dollars towards the
 
05:22:41.030 --> 05:22:41.040 align:start position:0%
american system of conservation funding
 
05:22:44.470 --> 05:22:44.480 align:start position:0%
last year new hampshire saw 150

05:22:47.910 --> 05:22:47.920 align:start position:0%

total of six million dollars
 
05:22:51.750 --> 05:22:51.760 align:start position:0%
on licenses with many of these
 
05:22:53.670 --> 05:22:53.680 align:start position:0%
individuals being
 
05:22:56.310 --> 05:22:56.320 align:start position:0%
uh taking part in ice fishing
 
05:22:56.320 --> 05:22:57.110 align:start position:0%
uh taking part in ice fishing
um

05:22:57.110 --> 05:22:57.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:22:59.110 --> 05:22:59.120 align:start position:0%
should a municipality
 
05:23:01.830 --> 05:23:01.840 align:start position:0%
opt to close its frozen public waters to
 
05:23:04.150 --> 05:23:04.160 align:start position:0%
such opportunities it would undoubtedly
 
05:23:06.150 --> 05:23:06.160 align:start position:0%
have a detrimental effect on the
 
05:23:08.788 --> 05:23:08.798 align:start position:0%
department's bottom line
 
05:23:10.628 --> 05:23:10.638 align:start position:0%
now i know that the department has
 
05:23:12.550 --> 05:23:12.560 align:start position:0%
already mentioned its concerns with the
 
05:23:15.030 --> 05:23:15.040 align:start position:0%
enforcement aspect um which i will you
 
05:23:15.040 --> 05:23:15.750 align:start position:0%
enforcement aspect um which i will you
know

05:23:15.750 --> 05:23:15.760 align:start position:0%
know
 
05:23:18.628 --> 05:23:18.638 align:start position:0%
refer to to their testimony
 
05:23:19.910 --> 05:23:19.920 align:start position:0%
but i believe that calling on
 
05:23:21.590 --> 05:23:21.600 align:start position:0%
enforcement uh to react to such
 
05:23:23.670 --> 05:23:23.680 align:start position:0%
variations is burdensome and time
 
05:23:25.670 --> 05:23:25.680 align:start position:0%
consuming as has been stated
 
05:23:26.948 --> 05:23:26.958 align:start position:0%
once again i'd like to reiterate my
 
05:23:29.590 --> 05:23:29.600 align:start position:0%
opposition to house bill 534 and i thank
 
05:23:32.788 --> 05:23:32.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:34.550 --> 05:23:34.560 align:start position:0%
thank you very much

05:23:45.750 --> 05:23:45.760 align:start position:0%
i see no question sir
 
05:23:48.390 --> 05:23:48.400 align:start position:0%
there being no questions
 
05:23:51.750 --> 05:23:51.760 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your testimony

local snowmobile clubs

the sport of snowmobiling and to promote

members of nhsa
 
05:25:06.550 --> 05:25:06.560 align:start position:0%
nhsa has several concerns regarding the
 
05:25:09.110 --> 05:25:09.120 align:start position:0%
negative impact of house bill 534
 
05:25:10.708 --> 05:25:10.718 align:start position:0%
could have on the sport of snowmobiling
 
05:25:11.990 --> 05:25:12.000 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire
 
05:25:13.830 --> 05:25:13.840 align:start position:0%
the bill would permit municipalities to
 
05:25:16.070 --> 05:25:16.080 align:start position:0%
regulate the time place and manner
 
05:25:17.910 --> 05:25:17.920 align:start position:0%
of use of frozen public waters of 100
 
05:25:19.430 --> 05:25:19.440 align:start position:0%
acres or less
 
05:25:20.868 --> 05:25:20.878 align:start position:0%
this could lead to a patchwork of
 
05:25:23.030 --> 05:25:23.040 align:start position:0%
restrictions for the snowmobilers on
 
05:25:26.150 --> 05:25:26.160 align:start position:0%
frozen public waters
 
05:25:28.390 --> 05:25:28.400 align:start position:0%
unless snowmobilers monitored each of
 
05:25:31.110 --> 05:25:31.120 align:start position:0%
the local governing bodies in the state
 
05:25:32.230 --> 05:25:32.240 align:start position:0%
they could be unaware of new
 
05:25:32.240 --> 05:25:34.230 align:start position:0%
they could be unaware of new
restrictions

05:25:34.230 --> 05:25:34.240 align:start position:0%
restrictions
 
05:25:36.550 --> 05:25:36.560 align:start position:0%
which could be implemented at any time
 
05:25:38.310 --> 05:25:38.320 align:start position:0%
snowmobiling is a major portion of
 
05:25:40.788 --> 05:25:40.798 align:start position:0%
winter tourism economy
 
05:25:43.190 --> 05:25:43.200 align:start position:0%
continued continual additions or

continued continual additions or
existing

05:25:44.708 --> 05:25:44.718 align:start position:0%
existing
 
05:25:46.948 --> 05:25:46.958 align:start position:0%
excuse me continual additions or
 
05:25:49.270 --> 05:25:49.280 align:start position:0%
eliminations of restrictions by local
 
05:25:51.750 --> 05:25:51.760 align:start position:0%
governing bodies without coordination
 
05:25:53.190 --> 05:25:53.200 align:start position:0%
and appropriate stakeholders would
 
05:25:55.510 --> 05:25:55.520 align:start position:0%
hamper the existing trail network and
 
05:25:57.910 --> 05:25:57.920 align:start position:0%
writers experiences across the state
 
05:26:00.150 --> 05:26:00.160 align:start position:0%
additionally violations of the
 
05:26:02.390 --> 05:26:02.400 align:start position:0%
restrictions would likely become common
 
05:26:04.230 --> 05:26:04.240 align:start position:0%
since many frozen bodies of water do not
 
05:26:06.868 --> 05:26:06.878 align:start position:0%
have a usual access point
 
05:26:10.310 --> 05:26:10.320 align:start position:0%
current nh law rsa 215 c4 provides the
 
05:26:12.628 --> 05:26:12.638 align:start position:0%
executive director of fish and game with
 
05:26:14.310 --> 05:26:14.320 align:start position:0%
the ability to temporarily close
 
05:26:16.628 --> 05:26:16.638 align:start position:0%
portions of frozen water for safety

concerns

05:26:17.670 --> 05:26:17.680 align:start position:0%
concerns
 
05:26:19.510 --> 05:26:19.520 align:start position:0%
this is a separate provision
 
05:26:21.830 --> 05:26:21.840 align:start position:0%
in the same law which limits speeds on
 
05:26:24.390 --> 05:26:24.400 align:start position:0%
back lake in pittsburgh between sunrise
 
05:26:25.670 --> 05:26:25.680 align:start position:0%
and sunset
 
05:26:28.070 --> 05:26:28.080 align:start position:0%
that statute indicates non-compliance
 
05:26:30.628 --> 05:26:30.638 align:start position:0%
with requirement is a violation
 
05:26:32.708 --> 05:26:32.718 align:start position:0%
since this restriction is law all
 
05:26:35.030 --> 05:26:35.040 align:start position:0%
parties are aware of its existence
 
05:26:37.110 --> 05:26:37.120 align:start position:0%
further the public was provided an
 
05:26:39.030 --> 05:26:39.040 align:start position:0%
opportunity to support or oppose the
 
05:26:41.510 --> 05:26:41.520 align:start position:0%
restriction prior to its enactment since
 
05:26:42.948 --> 05:26:42.958 align:start position:0%
it went through the state legislative
 
05:26:42.958 --> 05:26:44.470 align:start position:0%
it went through the state legislative
process

05:26:44.470 --> 05:26:44.480 align:start position:0%
process
 
05:26:46.868 --> 05:26:46.878 align:start position:0%
this is more transparent and effective
 
05:26:49.030 --> 05:26:49.040 align:start position:0%
manner to regulate uses of frozen bodies
 
05:26:49.040 --> 05:26:50.150 align:start position:0%
manner to regulate uses of frozen bodies

05:26:50.150 --> 05:26:50.160 align:start position:0%
water
 
05:26:52.310 --> 05:26:52.320 align:start position:0%
while not all clubs
 
05:26:53.830 --> 05:26:53.840 align:start position:0%
have trails that directly traverse
 
05:26:56.070 --> 05:26:56.080 align:start position:0%
frozen bodies of water some clubs use
 
05:26:58.230 --> 05:26:58.240 align:start position:0%
these lakes and ponds to hold annual
 
05:26:59.750 --> 05:26:59.760 align:start position:0%
fundraising events
 
05:27:01.430 --> 05:27:01.440 align:start position:0%
since fish and game regulates and
 
05:27:03.670 --> 05:27:03.680 align:start position:0%
enforces the laws that pertain to these
 
05:27:05.510 --> 05:27:05.520 align:start position:0%
areas we believe the state should
 
05:27:08.150 --> 05:27:08.160 align:start position:0%
maintain jurisdiction and control
 
05:27:10.070 --> 05:27:10.080 align:start position:0%
most municipal police departments simply
 
05:27:11.590 --> 05:27:11.600 align:start position:0%
do not have the specific seasonal
 
05:27:11.600 --> 05:27:12.868 align:start position:0%
do not have the specific seasonal
resources

05:27:12.868 --> 05:27:12.878 align:start position:0%
resources
 
05:27:15.190 --> 05:27:15.200 align:start position:0%
to effectively regulate snowmobiles
 
05:27:17.830 --> 05:27:17.840 align:start position:0%
enforcing municipal regulations would
 
05:27:19.750 --> 05:27:19.760 align:start position:0%
require winter equipment and extra
 
05:27:22.150 --> 05:27:22.160 align:start position:0%
personnel that are properly trained
 
05:27:24.230 --> 05:27:24.240 align:start position:0%
this is best left to the professional
 
05:27:26.230 --> 05:27:26.240 align:start position:0%
state agencies that have years of
 
05:27:28.150 --> 05:27:28.160 align:start position:0%
valuable experience in dealing with
 
05:27:29.590 --> 05:27:29.600 align:start position:0%
these areas
 
05:27:31.350 --> 05:27:31.360 align:start position:0%
if there was an issue
 
05:27:33.830 --> 05:27:33.840 align:start position:0%
for a frozen for a specific frozen water
 
05:27:36.310 --> 05:27:36.320 align:start position:0%
body the appropriate manner in which to
 
05:27:39.910 --> 05:27:39.920 align:start position:0%
address it is to introduce legislation
 
05:27:41.990 --> 05:27:42.000 align:start position:0%
that way any restrictions like those for
 
05:27:44.310 --> 05:27:44.320 align:start position:0%
back lake appear in a statute and the
 
05:27:46.070 --> 05:27:46.080 align:start position:0%
public can be better educated regarding
 
05:27:47.430 --> 05:27:47.440 align:start position:0%
the restrictions
 
05:27:49.750 --> 05:27:49.760 align:start position:0%
in addition interested stakeholders like
 
05:27:53.030 --> 05:27:53.040 align:start position:0%
nhsa fish and game and bureau of trails
 
05:27:55.430 --> 05:27:55.440 align:start position:0%
can assist with ensuring compliance the
 
05:27:57.670 --> 05:27:57.680 align:start position:0%
public's right to use navigable waters
 
05:27:59.670 --> 05:27:59.680 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire appears to be fairly
 
05:28:01.910 --> 05:28:01.920 align:start position:0%
broad in fact courts have held that
 
05:28:04.390 --> 05:28:04.400 align:start position:0%
public's right to use such waters is not
 
05:28:06.788 --> 05:28:06.798 align:start position:0%
merely limited to navigation and fishery
 
05:28:08.868 --> 05:28:08.878 align:start position:0%
but includes all the useful and lawful
 
05:28:08.878 --> 05:28:10.150 align:start position:0%
but includes all the useful and lawful
purposes

and we are opposed to to the bill as
 
05:29:56.868 --> 05:29:56.878 align:start position:0%
drafted we're looking at it from a
 
05:29:59.350 --> 05:29:59.360 align:start position:0%
landowner perspective and i'll say that
 
05:30:01.110 --> 05:30:01.120 align:start position:0%
mr stark from the timberland owners
 
05:30:03.350 --> 05:30:03.360 align:start position:0%
association addressed our concern with
 
05:30:05.110 --> 05:30:05.120 align:start position:0%
its confusion relative to the current
 
05:30:07.270 --> 05:30:07.280 align:start position:0%
definition of public waters being 10
 
05:30:10.310 --> 05:30:10.320 align:start position:0%
acres or more i'd just like to add that
 
05:30:12.070 --> 05:30:12.080 align:start position:0%
you know the current law has worked well
 
05:30:14.470 --> 05:30:14.480 align:start position:0%
for a number of years now by recognizing
 
05:30:16.948 --> 05:30:16.958 align:start position:0%
landowner riparian rights when it comes
 
05:30:18.788 --> 05:30:18.798 align:start position:0%
to small navigable
 
05:30:21.350 --> 05:30:21.360 align:start position:0%
uh non-navigable bodies of water
 
05:30:23.030 --> 05:30:23.040 align:start position:0%
our understanding that such rights
 
05:30:25.190 --> 05:30:25.200 align:start position:0%
extend to the midpoint of the body of
 
05:30:25.200 --> 05:30:26.708 align:start position:0%
extend to the midpoint of the body of
water

05:30:26.708 --> 05:30:26.718 align:start position:0%

with the marine patrol
 
05:32:24.470 --> 05:32:24.480 align:start position:0%
uh i had initially i forgive me i had
 
05:32:27.110 --> 05:32:27.120 align:start position:0%
initially intended to uh register as
 
05:32:29.590 --> 05:32:29.600 align:start position:0%
opposing this bill and and collect uh
 
05:32:31.910 --> 05:32:31.920 align:start position:0%
neutral uh marine patrol in the state
 
05:32:34.628 --> 05:32:34.638 align:start position:0%
police does oppose this bill
 
05:32:37.670 --> 05:32:37.680 align:start position:0%
for for general purposes and concerns of
 
05:32:39.670 --> 05:32:39.680 align:start position:0%
creating not only the patchwork of
 
05:32:41.590 --> 05:32:41.600 align:start position:0%
different rules and laws that that have
 
05:32:43.270 --> 05:32:43.280 align:start position:0%
been mentioned before me
 
05:32:45.510 --> 05:32:45.520 align:start position:0%
but also the potential of a slippery
 
05:32:47.110 --> 05:32:47.120 align:start position:0%
slope where the state would lose
 
05:32:49.350 --> 05:32:49.360 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction uh not only in frozen
 
05:32:50.948 --> 05:32:50.958 align:start position:0%
bodies of water but but what would
 
05:32:53.430 --> 05:32:53.440 align:start position:0%
happen when they were open uh
 
05:32:55.350 --> 05:32:55.360 align:start position:0%
and and any differences that that would
 
05:32:57.590 --> 05:32:57.600 align:start position:0%
then affect boating
 
05:32:59.510 --> 05:32:59.520 align:start position:0%
as many of you know
 
05:33:01.910 --> 05:33:01.920 align:start position:0%
there are unique challenges that that we
 
05:33:02.948 --> 05:33:02.958 align:start position:0%
face in
 
05:33:04.868 --> 05:33:04.878 align:start position:0%
in trying to regulate the competing uses
 
05:33:07.270 --> 05:33:07.280 align:start position:0%
of our public waters but there are
 
05:33:09.190 --> 05:33:09.200 align:start position:0%
processes that that you folks as the
 
05:33:11.510 --> 05:33:11.520 align:start position:0%
legislature have established through
 
05:33:13.750 --> 05:33:13.760 align:start position:0%
public hearing and rulemaking
 
05:33:16.628 --> 05:33:16.638 align:start position:0%
permit requirements that allow us to
 
05:33:18.548 --> 05:33:18.558 align:start position:0%
regulate these different activities when
 
05:33:20.230 --> 05:33:20.240 align:start position:0%
there is open water
 
05:33:22.470 --> 05:33:22.480 align:start position:0%
and and for that reason i would
 
05:33:24.470 --> 05:33:24.480 align:start position:0%
recommend that this be found in
 
05:33:26.310 --> 05:33:26.320 align:start position:0%
expedient to legislate
 
05:33:28.868 --> 05:33:28.878 align:start position:0%
uh as as it would be a dangerous
 
05:33:31.430 --> 05:33:31.440 align:start position:0%
circumstance in our opinion to
 
05:33:32.708 --> 05:33:32.718 align:start position:0%
yield the
 
05:33:35.350 --> 05:33:35.360 align:start position:0%
the state jurisdiction uh on these
 
05:33:37.270 --> 05:33:37.280 align:start position:0%
waters that we all know are held in
 
05:33:39.910 --> 05:33:39.920 align:start position:0%
public trust uh and and to be used for
 
05:33:42.628 --> 05:33:42.638 align:start position:0%
the greater good of all our citizens
 
05:33:44.070 --> 05:33:44.080 align:start position:0%
that's all i have for you today would be
 
05:33:46.868 --> 05:33:46.878 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions thank you
 
05:33:49.590 --> 05:33:49.600 align:start position:0%
so representative smith has a question
 
05:33:56.708 --> 05:33:56.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:01.910 --> 05:34:01.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:04.230 --> 05:34:04.240 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you uh for
 
05:34:06.788 --> 05:34:06.798 align:start position:0%
taking my question captain dunleavy um
 
05:34:09.910 --> 05:34:09.920 align:start position:0%
you did mention that there are processes
 
05:34:12.070 --> 05:34:12.080 align:start position:0%
that processes that people could go
 
05:34:14.868 --> 05:34:14.878 align:start position:0%
through or communities could go through
 
05:34:14.878 --> 05:34:15.750 align:start position:0%
through or communities could go through
um

05:34:15.750 --> 05:34:15.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:34:19.190 --> 05:34:19.200 align:start position:0%
on a case-by-case basis when the waters
 
05:34:20.390 --> 05:34:20.400 align:start position:0%
are open
 
05:34:23.510 --> 05:34:23.520 align:start position:0%
uh such as restricting speed limits or
 
05:34:26.548 --> 05:34:26.558 align:start position:0%
certain areas of lakes
 
05:34:30.070 --> 05:34:30.080 align:start position:0%
is there any way this could be
 
05:34:33.190 --> 05:34:33.200 align:start position:0%
put in to have also take place when the
 
05:34:36.230 --> 05:34:36.240 align:start position:0%
water bodies are frozen
 
05:34:39.110 --> 05:34:39.120 align:start position:0%
i i would hesitate to comment uh because
 
05:34:41.750 --> 05:34:41.760 align:start position:0%
when the lake is frozen it becomes a
 
05:34:45.270 --> 05:34:45.280 align:start position:0%
public way for automobiles and ohrvs
 
05:34:47.510 --> 05:34:47.520 align:start position:0%
uh certainly fish and game then has
 
05:34:50.230 --> 05:34:50.240 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction and and while i know they
 
05:34:52.548 --> 05:34:52.558 align:start position:0%
do require permits for for fishing
 
05:34:55.590 --> 05:34:55.600 align:start position:0%
derbies in various tournaments uh beyond
 
05:34:57.590 --> 05:34:57.600 align:start position:0%
that when it comes to their ohrv laws
 
05:34:59.270 --> 05:34:59.280 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm just not familiar and it
 
05:35:01.190 --> 05:35:01.200 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be able to speak to that man
 
05:35:05.510 --> 05:35:05.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:08.628 --> 05:35:08.638 align:start position:0%
any you uh any other questions of uh
 
05:35:11.030 --> 05:35:11.040 align:start position:0%
captain ventilator
 
05:35:13.510 --> 05:35:13.520 align:start position:0%
so i see no further questions
 
05:35:16.390 --> 05:35:16.400 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry representing nickel
 
05:35:18.150 --> 05:35:18.160 align:start position:0%
there's a bit of a lag there just a real
 
05:35:19.750 --> 05:35:19.760 align:start position:0%
quick question captain ben levy that i
 
05:35:22.788 --> 05:35:22.798 align:start position:0%
saw on another um testimony for you um
 
05:35:25.430 --> 05:35:25.440 align:start position:0%
can you please tell me when is a body of
 
05:35:27.110 --> 05:35:27.120 align:start position:0%
water considered
 
05:35:27.120 --> 05:35:29.750 align:start position:0%
water considered
frozen

05:35:29.750 --> 05:35:29.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:31.590 --> 05:35:31.600 align:start position:0%
i'm not aware of any definition other
 
05:35:33.910 --> 05:35:33.920 align:start position:0%
than the practical application of of
 
05:35:35.350 --> 05:35:35.360 align:start position:0%
what uh
 
05:35:37.270 --> 05:35:37.280 align:start position:0%
what frozen would mean certainly
 
05:35:39.190 --> 05:35:39.200 align:start position:0%
depending on the ice thickness uh the
 
05:35:41.510 --> 05:35:41.520 align:start position:0%
ability to conduct activities on it is
 
05:35:44.628 --> 05:35:44.638 align:start position:0%
going to obviously be determined by that
 
05:35:47.750 --> 05:35:47.760 align:start position:0%
by that uh that thickness of the
 
05:35:49.830 --> 05:35:49.840 align:start position:0%
so there's no definition
 
05:35:51.110 --> 05:35:51.120 align:start position:0%

05:37:05.510 --> 05:37:05.520 align:start position:0%
affiliation with the town of beau
 
05:37:08.070 --> 05:37:08.080 align:start position:0%
um considering my family grew up there
 
05:37:10.470 --> 05:37:10.480 align:start position:0%
um i don't personally recreate ontario
 
05:37:13.430 --> 05:37:13.440 align:start position:0%
pond besides bash fishing in the summer
 
05:37:16.150 --> 05:37:16.160 align:start position:0%
mostly uh if anyone has driven up white
 
05:37:18.708 --> 05:37:18.718 align:start position:0%
rock hill road which jerry pond is on
 
05:37:20.628 --> 05:37:20.638 align:start position:0%
you'll see the the name timmins road up
 
05:37:22.470 --> 05:37:22.480 align:start position:0%
there so we're somewhat familiar with
 
05:37:24.230 --> 05:37:24.240 align:start position:0%
the area
 
05:37:26.470 --> 05:37:26.480 align:start position:0%
in regards to representative wallace's
 
05:37:28.708 --> 05:37:28.718 align:start position:0%
uh testimony regarding
 
05:37:28.718 --> 05:37:29.670 align:start position:0%
uh testimony regarding
uh

05:37:29.670 --> 05:37:29.680 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:37:31.430 --> 05:37:31.440 align:start position:0%
the racing that takes place i can assure
 
05:37:32.948 --> 05:37:32.958 align:start position:0%
you that the users of the pond aren't
 
05:37:34.708 --> 05:37:34.718 align:start position:0%
racing motorcycles they're they're out
 
05:37:37.270 --> 05:37:37.280 align:start position:0%
there on ohrvs which is a per
 
05:37:38.830 --> 05:37:38.840 align:start position:0%
you know perfectly
 
05:37:41.190 --> 05:37:41.200 align:start position:0%
legitimate um and
 
05:37:43.990 --> 05:37:44.000 align:start position:0%
legal usage of that pawn
 
05:37:44.000 --> 05:37:44.788 align:start position:0%
legal usage of that pawn
uh

05:37:44.788 --> 05:37:44.798 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:37:46.868 --> 05:37:46.878 align:start position:0%
the public trust doctrine which is what
 
05:37:49.110 --> 05:37:49.120 align:start position:0%
was mentioned before as the common law
 
05:37:51.750 --> 05:37:51.760 align:start position:0%
that's codified in 27.20 you know kind
 
05:37:54.310 --> 05:37:54.320 align:start position:0%
of dictates at the cape at the state of
 
05:37:55.510 --> 05:37:55.520 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
05:37:57.350 --> 05:37:57.360 align:start position:0%
regulates these uh
 
05:38:00.788 --> 05:38:00.798 align:start position:0%
lakes and ponds 10 acres more or less um
 
05:38:03.110 --> 05:38:03.120 align:start position:0%
and you know as captain dunlevy you know
 
05:38:04.548 --> 05:38:04.558 align:start position:0%
mentioned earlier
 
05:38:06.788 --> 05:38:06.798 align:start position:0%
uh if not regulated for the benefit of
 
05:38:09.510 --> 05:38:09.520 align:start position:0%
all users and this is quote unquote in
 
05:38:11.270 --> 05:38:11.280 align:start position:0%
case law
 
05:38:13.030 --> 05:38:13.040 align:start position:0%
that it made advantage diminish the
 
05:38:15.270 --> 05:38:15.280 align:start position:0%
value that they're derived from i
 
05:38:17.030 --> 05:38:17.040 align:start position:0%
understand there's there's some concern
 
05:38:19.430 --> 05:38:19.440 align:start position:0%
about the usage of these lakes and ponds
 
05:38:22.628 --> 05:38:22.638 align:start position:0%
um i actually happen to uh
 
05:38:25.270 --> 05:38:25.280 align:start position:0%
you know ski fish swim and all these
 
05:38:26.390 --> 05:38:26.400 align:start position:0%
lakes and ponds in the state of new
 
05:38:27.830 --> 05:38:27.840 align:start position:0%
hampshire regardless of the township
 
05:38:29.030 --> 05:38:29.040 align:start position:0%
that they're in
 
05:38:31.750 --> 05:38:31.760 align:start position:0%
hence hence why they're public waters
 
05:38:31.760 --> 05:38:32.548 align:start position:0%
hence hence why they're public waters
uh

05:38:32.548 --> 05:38:32.558 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:38:34.470 --> 05:38:34.480 align:start position:0%
i'm a little taken back
 
05:38:34.480 --> 05:38:35.990 align:start position:0%
i'm a little taken back
by

05:38:35.990 --> 05:38:36.000 align:start position:0%
by
 
05:38:38.390 --> 05:38:38.400 align:start position:0%
the assumption that the users are racing
 
05:38:40.708 --> 05:38:40.718 align:start position:0%
racing per se you know i've been up at
 
05:38:42.310 --> 05:38:42.320 align:start position:0%
lake winnipesaukee in the summer before
 
05:38:44.390 --> 05:38:44.400 align:start position:0%
and seen you know 10 snowmobiles driving
 
05:38:46.628 --> 05:38:46.638 align:start position:0%
across and i'm not the assumption i
 
05:38:47.750 --> 05:38:47.760 align:start position:0%
don't have is that they're racing
 
05:38:49.670 --> 05:38:49.680 align:start position:0%
snowmobiles across the lake
 
05:38:49.680 --> 05:38:51.110 align:start position:0%
snowmobiles across the lake
um

05:38:51.110 --> 05:38:51.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:38:53.350 --> 05:38:53.360 align:start position:0%
and you know as stewards and stewards of
 
05:38:53.360 --> 05:38:55.030 align:start position:0%
and you know as stewards and stewards of
the

05:38:55.030 --> 05:38:55.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:38:56.310 --> 05:38:56.320 align:start position:0%
of the lakes and ponds that new
 
05:38:58.390 --> 05:38:58.400 align:start position:0%
hampshire has regulatory authority over
 
05:39:00.070 --> 05:39:00.080 align:start position:0%
i think we've all worked closely with
 
05:39:03.190 --> 05:39:03.200 align:start position:0%
fish and game to to to manage these
 
05:39:05.830 --> 05:39:05.840 align:start position:0%
competing uses and
 
05:39:07.750 --> 05:39:07.760 align:start position:0%
from a common standpoint i think that i
 
05:39:09.350 --> 05:39:09.360 align:start position:0%
think fish and game is doing a fantastic
 
05:39:11.830 --> 05:39:11.840 align:start position:0%
job regulating these and there is rules
 
05:39:14.070 --> 05:39:14.080 align:start position:0%
and regulations already set in place
 
05:39:17.110 --> 05:39:17.120 align:start position:0%
you know for these types of things so
 
05:39:18.868 --> 05:39:18.878 align:start position:0%
um i appreciate you guys giving me the
 
05:39:20.230 --> 05:39:20.240 align:start position:0%
opportunity to take you know for
 
05:39:22.230 --> 05:39:22.240 align:start position:0%
testimony today and uh
 
05:39:24.150 --> 05:39:24.160 align:start position:0%
hope you guys will vote you know
 
05:39:26.390 --> 05:39:26.400 align:start position:0%
not expedient to legislate on this bill
 
05:39:30.150 --> 05:39:30.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:31.990 --> 05:39:32.000 align:start position:0%

mr leflame
 
05:39:58.548 --> 05:39:58.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:01.270 --> 05:40:01.280 align:start position:0%
hi thank you just a minute um i live on
 
05:40:02.548 --> 05:40:02.558 align:start position:0%
turry pond
 
05:40:04.948 --> 05:40:04.958 align:start position:0%
absolutely it's racing i have pictures
 
05:40:07.030 --> 05:40:07.040 align:start position:0%
they come out with plows they plow race
 
05:40:07.040 --> 05:40:07.990 align:start position:0%
they come out with plows they plow race
tracks

05:40:07.990 --> 05:40:08.000 align:start position:0%
tracks
 
05:40:09.990 --> 05:40:10.000 align:start position:0%
um we're talking about many vehicles
 
05:40:12.230 --> 05:40:12.240 align:start position:0%
parked on the ice trucks trailers
 
05:40:13.990 --> 05:40:14.000 align:start position:0%
motorcycles it's an organization that
 
05:40:15.750 --> 05:40:15.760 align:start position:0%
comes out and does racing we're not
 
05:40:17.830 --> 05:40:17.840 align:start position:0%
talking about snowmobiles crossing ponds
 
05:40:19.350 --> 05:40:19.360 align:start position:0%
the legislation may or may not be the
 
05:40:21.110 --> 05:40:21.120 align:start position:0%
right way to address it but i just want
 
05:40:22.230 --> 05:40:22.240 align:start position:0%
to be clear
 
05:40:25.110 --> 05:40:25.120 align:start position:0%
this is loud this is all day long and it
 
05:40:26.868 --> 05:40:26.878 align:start position:0%
is a problem it needs to get addressed
 
05:40:28.708 --> 05:40:28.718 align:start position:0%
somehow whether or not again this
 
05:40:29.910 --> 05:40:29.920 align:start position:0%
legislation is the right way i don't
 
05:40:31.750 --> 05:40:31.760 align:start position:0%
know but um i just want to be clear
 
05:40:33.190 --> 05:40:33.200 align:start position:0%
because the last speaker was saying that
 
05:40:34.948 --> 05:40:34.958 align:start position:0%
this was not racing and that was an
 
05:40:37.430 --> 05:40:37.440 align:start position:0%
assumption yeah this is an organized
 
05:40:37.440 --> 05:40:38.868 align:start position:0%
assumption yeah this is an organized
race

05:40:38.868 --> 05:40:38.878 align:start position:0%
race
 
05:40:40.868 --> 05:40:40.878 align:start position:0%
and it's very loud um i'm right on the
 
05:40:43.750 --> 05:40:43.760 align:start position:0%
pawn um sandy crystal is probably a
 
05:40:45.830 --> 05:40:45.840 align:start position:0%
quarter mile up a hill and it's loud at
 
05:40:48.310 --> 05:40:48.320 align:start position:0%
her house so it's really loud where i am
 
05:40:50.390 --> 05:40:50.400 align:start position:0%
with the windows closed um and it
 
05:40:53.350 --> 05:40:53.360 align:start position:0%
happened i have two dates january 27th
 
05:40:56.390 --> 05:40:56.400 align:start position:0%
and february 10th in 2019 i'm looking at
 
05:40:58.548 --> 05:40:58.558 align:start position:0%
the time stamp on my pictures so if that
 
05:41:00.708 --> 05:41:00.718 align:start position:0%
helps that's that's what the situation's
 
05:41:01.750 --> 05:41:01.760 align:start position:0%
about and that's what we're really
 
05:41:05.510 --> 05:41:05.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:08.708 --> 05:41:08.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:10.628 --> 05:41:10.638 align:start position:0%

uh the
 
05:57:55.350 --> 05:57:55.360 align:start position:0%
uh it has to be because

where it's there there's
 
05:57:59.590 --> 05:57:59.600 align:start position:0%

otherwise

not everyone will get to speak and then
 
05:58:31.110 --> 05:58:31.120 align:start position:0%
we will have to continue the meeting and
 
05:58:33.110 --> 05:58:33.120 align:start position:0%
i don't think
 
05:58:35.270 --> 05:58:35.280 align:start position:0%
that that does
 
05:58:37.030 --> 05:58:37.040 align:start position:0%
the public

get i'll do this very briefly mr chair
 
06:00:09.110 --> 06:00:09.120 align:start position:0%
uh white road marsh some of you may know
 
06:00:11.350 --> 06:00:11.360 align:start position:0%
is a man-made wildlife management area
 
06:00:12.948 --> 06:00:12.958 align:start position:0%
controlled by the department of fish and
 
06:00:12.958 --> 06:00:13.910 align:start position:0%
controlled by the department of fish and
game

06:00:13.910 --> 06:00:13.920 align:start position:0%
game
 
06:00:15.670 --> 06:00:15.680 align:start position:0%
uh for the majority of the year it's
 
06:00:19.270 --> 06:00:19.280 align:start position:0%
enjoyed by hikers and mainly waterfowl
 
06:00:21.270 --> 06:00:21.280 align:start position:0%
until recently it was also enjoyed by
 
06:00:23.670 --> 06:00:23.680 align:start position:0%
local families for a couple of days of a
 
06:00:25.670 --> 06:00:25.680 align:start position:0%
couple of months of the winter when the
 
06:00:27.190 --> 06:00:27.200 align:start position:0%
marsh is frozen
 
06:00:29.110 --> 06:00:29.120 align:start position:0%
by putting some screws in the tires of
 
06:00:30.548 --> 06:00:30.558 align:start position:0%
their dirt bikes
 
06:00:32.310 --> 06:00:32.320 align:start position:0%
and going out and horsing around on the
 
06:00:34.470 --> 06:00:34.480 align:start position:0%
ice is the way to pass the time in our
 
06:00:36.548 --> 06:00:36.558 align:start position:0%
long winters
 
06:00:40.150 --> 06:00:40.160 align:start position:0%
uh two years ago prohibition on ohrvs
 
06:00:42.150 --> 06:00:42.160 align:start position:0%
was tucked into our budget
 
06:00:44.708 --> 06:00:44.718 align:start position:0%
uh it certainly targeted these families
 
06:00:47.510 --> 06:00:47.520 align:start position:0%
um and from what i've gathered it's
 
06:00:48.868 --> 06:00:48.878 align:start position:0%
because one or two of the neighbors
 
06:00:51.030 --> 06:00:51.040 align:start position:0%
objected to them even being there
 
06:00:52.948 --> 06:00:52.958 align:start position:0%
being there enjoying one of our public
 
06:00:52.958 --> 06:00:54.708 align:start position:0%
being there enjoying one of our public
resources

06:00:54.708 --> 06:00:54.718 align:start position:0%
resources
 
06:00:56.868 --> 06:00:56.878 align:start position:0%
there were no public hearings no ability
 
06:00:58.628 --> 06:00:58.638 align:start position:0%
for discussion
 
06:01:01.030 --> 06:01:01.040 align:start position:0%
no chance of solving any of the issues
 
06:01:03.190 --> 06:01:03.200 align:start position:0%
if there are any just a prohibition
 
06:01:05.030 --> 06:01:05.040 align:start position:0%
slipped into the budget
 
06:01:07.350 --> 06:01:07.360 align:start position:0%
uh i feel that this process is wrong and
 
06:01:09.350 --> 06:01:09.360 align:start position:0%
not how our house should conduct its
 
06:01:09.360 --> 06:01:10.788 align:start position:0%
not how our house should conduct its
business

06:01:10.788 --> 06:01:10.798 align:start position:0%
business
 
06:01:13.430 --> 06:01:13.440 align:start position:0%
uh i also feel it's wrong actually for
 
06:01:15.670 --> 06:01:15.680 align:start position:0%
one or two people
 
06:01:17.510 --> 06:01:17.520 align:start position:0%
to deprive the public from enjoying one
 
06:01:19.670 --> 06:01:19.680 align:start position:0%
of their own resources
 
06:01:21.430 --> 06:01:21.440 align:start position:0%
i'm a firm believer that if you live
 
06:01:23.430 --> 06:01:23.440 align:start position:0%
next to a public resource
 
06:01:25.830 --> 06:01:25.840 align:start position:0%
uh then you need to expect you're going
 
06:01:27.510 --> 06:01:27.520 align:start position:0%
to see and even hear them from time to
 
06:01:27.520 --> 06:01:28.390 align:start position:0%
to see and even hear them from time to
time

06:01:28.390 --> 06:01:28.400 align:start position:0%
time
 
06:01:30.150 --> 06:01:30.160 align:start position:0%
and after listening to the last hearing
 
06:01:32.470 --> 06:01:32.480 align:start position:0%
which is directly related to this one
 
06:01:34.470 --> 06:01:34.480 align:start position:0%
uh by their own admission we're talking
 
06:01:37.190 --> 06:01:37.200 align:start position:0%
about two or three days of the year
 
06:01:40.548 --> 06:01:40.558 align:start position:0%
two or three days out of 365 days
 
06:01:43.110 --> 06:01:43.120 align:start position:0%
i don't know how that rises to problem
 
06:01:45.110 --> 06:01:45.120 align:start position:0%
uh but nonetheless
 
06:01:47.270 --> 06:01:47.280 align:start position:0%
um i'm also concerned about the
 
06:01:48.708 --> 06:01:48.718 align:start position:0%
president at the sets you've heard
 
06:01:50.310 --> 06:01:50.320 align:start position:0%
you've heard other things on that what's
 
06:01:53.430 --> 06:01:53.440 align:start position:0%
next which pond which trail which lake
 
06:01:55.670 --> 06:01:55.680 align:start position:0%
so i do know that this issue was brought
 
06:01:57.430 --> 06:01:57.440 align:start position:0%
up last year as an amendment uh from
 
06:01:59.030 --> 06:01:59.040 align:start position:0%
what i understand the carrying bill
 
06:02:00.948 --> 06:02:00.958 align:start position:0%
wasn't actually uh looked at favorably
 
06:02:02.788 --> 06:02:02.798 align:start position:0%
by the committee so it didn't go
 
06:02:04.628 --> 06:02:04.638 align:start position:0%
anywhere uh of course then covert hit
 
06:02:06.628 --> 06:02:06.638 align:start position:0%
and the discussions on pretty much
 
06:02:07.830 --> 06:02:07.840 align:start position:0%
everything so
 
06:02:10.310 --> 06:02:10.320 align:start position:0%
i decided to reintroduce the bill well
 
06:02:12.230 --> 06:02:12.240 align:start position:0%
we introduced this bill
 
06:02:13.830 --> 06:02:13.840 align:start position:0%
and for two simple reasons as i've
 
06:02:13.840 --> 06:02:14.948 align:start position:0%
and for two simple reasons as i've
explained

06:02:14.948 --> 06:02:14.958 align:start position:0%
explained
 
06:02:17.030 --> 06:02:17.040 align:start position:0%
uh to right the wrong of a non-germain
 
06:02:18.868 --> 06:02:18.878 align:start position:0%
amendment with no public hearings add it
 
06:02:21.030 --> 06:02:21.040 align:start position:0%
to an appropriation bill
 
06:02:23.510 --> 06:02:23.520 align:start position:0%
and two hopefully
 
06:02:25.510 --> 06:02:25.520 align:start position:0%
that we can set a precedent by the if
 
06:02:26.948 --> 06:02:26.958 align:start position:0%
there are legitimate issues with the
 
06:02:26.958 --> 06:02:27.990 align:start position:0%
there are legitimate issues with the
neighbors

06:02:27.990 --> 06:02:28.000 align:start position:0%
neighbors
 
06:02:30.390 --> 06:02:30.400 align:start position:0%
uh that we can solve them by talking not
 
06:02:33.270 --> 06:02:33.280 align:start position:0%
simply by banning um these resources are
 
06:02:36.070 --> 06:02:36.080 align:start position:0%
for everybody to use we just all use
 
06:02:37.830 --> 06:02:37.840 align:start position:0%
them a little differently
 
06:02:40.470 --> 06:02:40.480 align:start position:0%
that's basically why i'm doing this
 
06:02:42.230 --> 06:02:42.240 align:start position:0%
i hope the committee will support this
 
06:02:42.240 --> 06:02:43.350 align:start position:0%
i hope the committee will support this
theory

06:02:43.350 --> 06:02:43.360 align:start position:0%
theory
 
06:02:43.360 --> 06:02:44.390 align:start position:0%
theory
um

06:02:44.390 --> 06:02:44.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:02:46.708 --> 06:02:46.718 align:start position:0%
i'll entertain questions if you care mr
 
06:02:49.110 --> 06:02:49.120 align:start position:0%
chair uh but i know you're pressed for
 
06:02:50.788 --> 06:02:50.798 align:start position:0%
time and there are other people signed
 
06:02:52.310 --> 06:02:52.320 align:start position:0%
up that can probably answer a lot of the
 
06:02:54.868 --> 06:02:54.878 align:start position:0%
details and specifics better than i so

06:03:12.948 --> 06:03:12.958 align:start position:0%
testimony you just said that the problem
 
06:03:16.470 --> 06:03:16.480 align:start position:0%
that exists on hoyt pond is just two or
 
06:03:19.030 --> 06:03:19.040 align:start position:0%
three days a year could you please tell
 
06:03:21.830 --> 06:03:21.840 align:start position:0%
me where you got data that says on point
 
06:03:24.628 --> 06:03:24.638 align:start position:0%
pond the problem is just two or three
 
06:03:26.150 --> 06:03:26.160 align:start position:0%
days a year
 
06:03:28.230 --> 06:03:28.240 align:start position:0%
well i didn't refer to hoyt road marsh
 
06:03:29.910 --> 06:03:29.920 align:start position:0%
on this one it was a testimony on i
 
06:03:32.310 --> 06:03:32.320 align:start position:0%
believe terrell pond that was said on
 
06:03:34.390 --> 06:03:34.400 align:start position:0%
the last hearing they are related that's
 
06:03:35.910 --> 06:03:35.920 align:start position:0%
why i brought it up maybe i shouldn't
 
06:03:37.910 --> 06:03:37.920 align:start position:0%
have uh but in talking to the people
 
06:03:39.670 --> 06:03:39.680 align:start position:0%
that are involved i'm hearing the same
 
06:03:42.948 --> 06:03:42.958 align:start position:0%
thing uh it's ice ice permitting
 
06:03:45.270 --> 06:03:45.280 align:start position:0%
and it's only a two month window and
 
06:03:46.788 --> 06:03:46.798 align:start position:0%
we're looking at a couple of weekends a
 
06:03:46.798 --> 06:03:48.310 align:start position:0%
we're looking at a couple of weekends a
year

06:03:48.310 --> 06:03:48.320 align:start position:0%
year
 
06:03:50.150 --> 06:03:50.160 align:start position:0%
is what i've been told i don't have any
 
06:03:51.350 --> 06:03:51.360 align:start position:0%
hard data
 
06:03:53.990 --> 06:03:54.000 align:start position:0%
but i perhaps some of the people that
 
06:03:56.548 --> 06:03:56.558 align:start position:0%
behind me speaking will have an answer
 
06:03:57.910 --> 06:03:57.920 align:start position:0%
to that question
 
06:03:59.670 --> 06:03:59.680 align:start position:0%
thank you representative

committee uh captain michael eastman
 
06:04:36.470 --> 06:04:36.480 align:start position:0%
with fish and game uh we are in favor of
 
06:04:38.150 --> 06:04:38.160 align:start position:0%
the repeal this ban
 
06:04:38.160 --> 06:04:39.110 align:start position:0%
the repeal this ban
um

06:04:39.110 --> 06:04:39.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:04:42.470 --> 06:04:42.480 align:start position:0%
our issues are similar to uh
 
06:04:42.480 --> 06:04:43.190 align:start position:0%
our issues are similar to uh
to

06:04:43.190 --> 06:04:43.200 align:start position:0%
to
 
06:04:45.190 --> 06:04:45.200 align:start position:0%
representative walsh
 
06:04:47.030 --> 06:04:47.040 align:start position:0%
on this bill
 
06:04:51.350 --> 06:04:51.360 align:start position:0%
an all-out ban on ohrv's limits um not
 
06:04:51.360 --> 06:04:53.190 align:start position:0%
an all-out ban on ohrv's limits um not
only

06:04:53.190 --> 06:04:53.200 align:start position:0%
only
 
06:04:55.830 --> 06:04:55.840 align:start position:0%
trail bikes or dirt bikes out on the
 
06:04:55.840 --> 06:04:56.868 align:start position:0%
trail bikes or dirt bikes out on the
pond

06:04:56.868 --> 06:04:56.878 align:start position:0%
pond
 
06:04:58.788 --> 06:04:58.798 align:start position:0%
that are legally using the pond but it
 
06:05:01.270 --> 06:05:01.280 align:start position:0%
also restricts
 
06:05:03.670 --> 06:05:03.680 align:start position:0%
ice fishermen to drive out on the pond
 
06:05:04.788 --> 06:05:04.798 align:start position:0%
and use
 
06:05:06.150 --> 06:05:06.160 align:start position:0%
that method
 
06:05:07.510 --> 06:05:07.520 align:start position:0%
with somebody who may have limited
 
06:05:09.430 --> 06:05:09.440 align:start position:0%
mobility to get out
 
06:05:12.548 --> 06:05:12.558 align:start position:0%
into that area to fish so therefore
 
06:05:15.990 --> 06:05:16.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:18.390 --> 06:05:18.400 align:start position:0%
really prohibit somebody from allowing a
 
06:05:20.470 --> 06:05:20.480 align:start position:0%
big getting out there to fish
 
06:05:22.868 --> 06:05:22.878 align:start position:0%
if they had issues
 
06:05:24.948 --> 06:05:24.958 align:start position:0%
there are no other bands on any other
 
06:05:27.750 --> 06:05:27.760 align:start position:0%
bodies of water for hrv use
 
06:05:29.430 --> 06:05:29.440 align:start position:0%
there are restrictions
 
06:05:33.270 --> 06:05:33.280 align:start position:0%
in some but not all-out bands
 
06:05:35.510 --> 06:05:35.520 align:start position:0%
once again this is a slippery slope when
 
06:05:38.390 --> 06:05:38.400 align:start position:0%
we start banning certain types of use
 
06:05:42.628 --> 06:05:42.638 align:start position:0%
on frozen bodies of water um in which um
 
06:05:44.948 --> 06:05:44.958 align:start position:0%
you know what is next
 
06:05:47.430 --> 06:05:47.440 align:start position:0%
certain bans on people ice fishing bob
 
06:05:47.440 --> 06:05:48.948 align:start position:0%
certain bans on people ice fishing bob
houses

06:05:48.948 --> 06:05:48.958 align:start position:0%
houses
 
06:05:50.788 --> 06:05:50.798 align:start position:0%
things of that nature so
 
06:05:53.750 --> 06:05:53.760 align:start position:0%
we would ask that this ban be repealed
 
06:05:56.948 --> 06:05:56.958 align:start position:0%
for a hoyt road marsh um another issue i
 
06:05:58.548 --> 06:05:58.558 align:start position:0%
know that's going to be presented will
 
06:06:01.910 --> 06:06:01.920 align:start position:0%
be an impact of wildlife and certainly
 
06:06:04.548 --> 06:06:04.558 align:start position:0%
if we had any issue with an impact of
 
06:06:06.948 --> 06:06:06.958 align:start position:0%
wildlife we would not be asking for this
 
06:06:10.070 --> 06:06:10.080 align:start position:0%
repeal um any uh
 
06:06:12.948 --> 06:06:12.958 align:start position:0%
reptiles or amphibians uh during the
 
06:06:14.868 --> 06:06:14.878 align:start position:0%
months that is frozen
 
06:06:17.510 --> 06:06:17.520 align:start position:0%
um are in hibernation at the bottom of
 
06:06:19.830 --> 06:06:19.840 align:start position:0%
the pond they're not affected
 
06:06:21.670 --> 06:06:21.680 align:start position:0%
per se um
 
06:06:21.680 --> 06:06:22.548 align:start position:0%
per se um
by

06:06:22.548 --> 06:06:22.558 align:start position:0%
by
 
06:06:24.788 --> 06:06:24.798 align:start position:0%
use of ohrvs
 
06:06:26.390 --> 06:06:26.400 align:start position:0%
um any
 
06:06:28.230 --> 06:06:28.240 align:start position:0%
real uh
 
06:06:29.750 --> 06:06:29.760 align:start position:0%
issues that
 
06:06:31.590 --> 06:06:31.600 align:start position:0%
turtles and and things that issue would
 
06:06:33.350 --> 06:06:33.360 align:start position:0%
have would would probably be more with
 
06:06:33.360 --> 06:06:34.230 align:start position:0%
have would would probably be more with
the

06:06:34.230 --> 06:06:34.240 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:06:34.240 --> 06:06:35.110 align:start position:0%
the
road

06:06:35.110 --> 06:06:35.120 align:start position:0%
road
 
06:06:38.230 --> 06:06:38.240 align:start position:0%
um itself and crossing the road
 
06:06:41.110 --> 06:06:41.120 align:start position:0%
other wildlife certainly um there is uh
 
06:06:43.430 --> 06:06:43.440 align:start position:0%
noise but we don't feel that there's a
 
06:06:45.750 --> 06:06:45.760 align:start position:0%
large impact on the wildlife so
 
06:06:47.350 --> 06:06:47.360 align:start position:0%
therefore we would ask for the this
 
06:06:49.670 --> 06:06:49.680 align:start position:0%
committee to repeal this ban on
 
06:06:51.830 --> 06:06:51.840 align:start position:0%
the use of ohrvis on hoyt road marsh
 
06:06:54.230 --> 06:06:54.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:55.990 --> 06:06:56.000 align:start position:0%
so you have one question from
 
06:06:57.990 --> 06:06:58.000 align:start position:0%
representative smith representative
 
06:07:00.868 --> 06:07:00.878 align:start position:0%
smith for a question
 
06:07:02.548 --> 06:07:02.558 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you again
 
06:07:05.270 --> 06:07:05.280 align:start position:0%
captain eastman um
 
06:07:08.470 --> 06:07:08.480 align:start position:0%
this bill uh last year as you know we
 
06:07:08.480 --> 06:07:09.350 align:start position:0%
this bill uh last year as you know we
did

06:07:09.350 --> 06:07:09.360 align:start position:0%
did
 
06:07:11.430 --> 06:07:11.440 align:start position:0%
have a public hearing on an amendment
 
06:07:13.590 --> 06:07:13.600 align:start position:0%
which was never adopted
 
06:07:16.628 --> 06:07:16.638 align:start position:0%
and the that amendment had restrictions
 
06:07:18.868 --> 06:07:18.878 align:start position:0%
it was opening up
 
06:07:21.990 --> 06:07:22.000 align:start position:0%
hoyt road marsh to
 
06:07:26.070 --> 06:07:26.080 align:start position:0%
to use by ohrvs and in particular the
 
06:07:26.080 --> 06:07:27.430 align:start position:0%
to use by ohrvs and in particular the
motorcycles

06:07:27.430 --> 06:07:27.440 align:start position:0%
motorcycles
 
06:07:30.310 --> 06:07:30.320 align:start position:0%
but it had restrictions would you
 
06:07:33.110 --> 06:07:33.120 align:start position:0%
support this bill being amended to have
 
06:07:35.750 --> 06:07:35.760 align:start position:0%
restrictions such as
 
06:07:38.788 --> 06:07:38.798 align:start position:0%
only use during the day time or certain
 
06:07:40.948 --> 06:07:40.958 align:start position:0%
days of the week such as the amendment
 
06:07:43.670 --> 06:07:43.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:45.910 --> 06:07:45.920 align:start position:0%
thank you representative smith i
 
06:07:47.910 --> 06:07:47.920 align:start position:0%
assisted uh representative flanagan last
 
06:07:49.670 --> 06:07:49.680 align:start position:0%
year and worked through some of those
 
06:07:52.548 --> 06:07:52.558 align:start position:0%
restrictions um i think uh
 
06:07:54.230 --> 06:07:54.240 align:start position:0%
if we were to look at restrictions that
 
06:07:55.910 --> 06:07:55.920 align:start position:0%
are we better to
 
06:07:58.470 --> 06:07:58.480 align:start position:0%
do those through our rule-making process
 
06:08:00.470 --> 06:08:00.480 align:start position:0%
instead of putting them into law
 
06:08:03.590 --> 06:08:03.600 align:start position:0%
um as we attempted to do last year but i
 
06:08:05.590 --> 06:08:05.600 align:start position:0%
think that it would be better if there
 
06:08:07.030 --> 06:08:07.040 align:start position:0%
were going to be restrictions to sit
 
06:08:10.788 --> 06:08:10.798 align:start position:0%
down with each group and and see what uh
 
06:08:13.750 --> 06:08:13.760 align:start position:0%
what would be workable for everyone i
 
06:08:16.470 --> 06:08:16.480 align:start position:0%
would say operation at night a lot of
 
06:08:16.480 --> 06:08:17.830 align:start position:0%
would say operation at night a lot of
these

06:08:17.830 --> 06:08:17.840 align:start position:0%
these
 
06:08:20.788 --> 06:08:20.798 align:start position:0%
dirt bikes and trail bikes do not have
 
06:08:23.110 --> 06:08:23.120 align:start position:0%
the appropriate lighting uh for
 
06:08:25.030 --> 06:08:25.040 align:start position:0%
nighttime use so that i don't believe
 
06:08:26.628 --> 06:08:26.638 align:start position:0%
that would be a concern but certainly
 
06:08:29.350 --> 06:08:29.360 align:start position:0%
could be a part of the restrictions
 
06:08:32.230 --> 06:08:32.240 align:start position:0%
follow up mr chair
 
06:08:33.990 --> 06:08:34.000 align:start position:0%
yeah um thank you
 
06:08:38.150 --> 06:08:38.160 align:start position:0%
um i know that uh i have been told by
 
06:08:41.030 --> 06:08:41.040 align:start position:0%
people who live in the area that there
 
06:08:44.310 --> 06:08:44.320 align:start position:0%
is now um racing around on motorcycles
 
06:08:48.070 --> 06:08:48.080 align:start position:0%
um on lake wickwass and meredith and i
 
06:08:51.670 --> 06:08:51.680 align:start position:0%
know that turtle pond is open to that uh
 
06:08:53.750 --> 06:08:53.760 align:start position:0%
activity also
 
06:08:55.190 --> 06:08:55.200 align:start position:0%
um and
 
06:08:57.910 --> 06:08:57.920 align:start position:0%
do you know of other ponds where there
 
06:08:58.948 --> 06:08:58.958 align:start position:0%
is a
 
06:09:01.990 --> 06:09:02.000 align:start position:0%
the excitement and the fun of
 
06:09:05.350 --> 06:09:05.360 align:start position:0%
motorcycles on ice is growing by year
 
06:09:08.548 --> 06:09:08.558 align:start position:0%
and year year after year
 
06:09:11.190 --> 06:09:11.200 align:start position:0%
i can say in the time of covid that
 
06:09:13.190 --> 06:09:13.200 align:start position:0%
certainly uh there's an increase in
 
06:09:15.110 --> 06:09:15.120 align:start position:0%
sales on
 
06:09:18.628 --> 06:09:18.638 align:start position:0%
ohrvs trail bikes being one of them
 
06:09:20.948 --> 06:09:20.958 align:start position:0%
and any outdoor use
 
06:09:23.030 --> 06:09:23.040 align:start position:0%
has certainly increased so
 
06:09:26.788 --> 06:09:26.798 align:start position:0%
but as far as specific um
 
06:09:29.910 --> 06:09:29.920 align:start position:0%
pawns that are also being used um
 
06:09:32.708 --> 06:09:32.718 align:start position:0%
i used to be uh stationed in the in the
 
06:09:35.590 --> 06:09:35.600 align:start position:0%
southern section of uh the lakes region
 
06:09:36.948 --> 06:09:36.958 align:start position:0%
and i know
 
06:09:38.948 --> 06:09:38.958 align:start position:0%
lily pawn and guilford
 
06:09:40.070 --> 06:09:40.080 align:start position:0%
you had
 
06:09:41.910 --> 06:09:41.920 align:start position:0%
actually snowmobiles that would go out
 
06:09:43.110 --> 06:09:43.120 align:start position:0%
and use
 
06:09:46.390 --> 06:09:46.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:48.548 --> 06:09:48.558 align:start position:0%
racing i think it's a bad term but you
 
06:09:50.708 --> 06:09:50.718 align:start position:0%
know certainly they did go out and then
 
06:09:53.670 --> 06:09:53.680 align:start position:0%
use the pond in it in that certain uh
 
06:09:53.680 --> 06:09:54.868 align:start position:0%
use the pond in it in that certain uh
fashion

06:09:54.868 --> 06:09:54.878 align:start position:0%
fashion
 
06:09:57.750 --> 06:09:57.760 align:start position:0%
and also dirt bikes use it as well
 
06:10:00.070 --> 06:10:00.080 align:start position:0%
i know that sand dougherty pond and
 
06:10:02.628 --> 06:10:02.638 align:start position:0%
northfield also had this
 
06:10:04.390 --> 06:10:04.400 align:start position:0%
from time to time
 
06:10:06.070 --> 06:10:06.080 align:start position:0%
so there were you know once again these
 
06:10:08.150 --> 06:10:08.160 align:start position:0%
are state bodies of water it was
 
06:10:10.708 --> 06:10:10.718 align:start position:0%
permitted use um
 
06:10:12.628 --> 06:10:12.638 align:start position:0%
and you know certainly
 
06:10:14.948 --> 06:10:14.958 align:start position:0%
lily pond and guilford um was one that i
 
06:10:16.868 --> 06:10:16.878 align:start position:0%
can think of but it was next to the
 
06:10:18.470 --> 06:10:18.480 align:start position:0%
airport with
 
06:10:20.310 --> 06:10:20.320 align:start position:0%
you know a shopping center across the
 
06:10:23.590 --> 06:10:23.600 align:start position:0%
way and and uh around it so i you know
 
06:10:25.590 --> 06:10:25.600 align:start position:0%
there weren't per se residents that were
 
06:10:27.670 --> 06:10:27.680 align:start position:0%
affected by it
 
06:10:31.270 --> 06:10:31.280 align:start position:0%
mr chair one final follow-up
 
06:10:31.280 --> 06:10:34.628 align:start position:0%
mr chair one final follow-up
yes

06:10:34.628 --> 06:10:34.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:10:37.350 --> 06:10:37.360 align:start position:0%
whenever there are large numbers of
 
06:10:40.788 --> 06:10:40.798 align:start position:0%
people congregating whether it's on open
 
06:10:40.798 --> 06:10:42.150 align:start position:0%
people congregating whether it's on open
water

06:10:42.150 --> 06:10:42.160 align:start position:0%
water
 
06:10:45.830 --> 06:10:45.840 align:start position:0%
with limited access to restrooms or on
 
06:10:47.670 --> 06:10:47.680 align:start position:0%
ice if there's a bunch of people
 
06:10:49.590 --> 06:10:49.600 align:start position:0%
spending the afternoon
 
06:10:51.830 --> 06:10:51.840 align:start position:0%
on their motorcycles or ohrvs or
 
06:10:51.840 --> 06:10:53.190 align:start position:0%
on their motorcycles or ohrvs or
whatever

06:10:53.190 --> 06:10:53.200 align:start position:0%
whatever
 
06:10:56.548 --> 06:10:56.558 align:start position:0%
there's an issue with restrooms and lack
 
06:10:59.190 --> 06:10:59.200 align:start position:0%
of facilities and trash
 
06:11:00.868 --> 06:11:00.878 align:start position:0%
is that something that fish and game
 
06:11:03.190 --> 06:11:03.200 align:start position:0%
would be responsible for like installing
 
06:11:06.788 --> 06:11:06.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:09.510 --> 06:11:09.520 align:start position:0%
we would not be responsible uh for it um
 
06:11:12.230 --> 06:11:12.240 align:start position:0%
if there was going to be a set of i say
 
06:11:13.750 --> 06:11:13.760 align:start position:0%
sanction if there was going to be an
 
06:11:13.760 --> 06:11:15.270 align:start position:0%
sanction if there was going to be an
event

06:11:15.270 --> 06:11:15.280 align:start position:0%
event
 
06:11:18.310 --> 06:11:18.320 align:start position:0%
with ohrvs attached to it um
 
06:11:20.230 --> 06:11:20.240 align:start position:0%
person the people would have to get an
 
06:11:23.190 --> 06:11:23.200 align:start position:0%
event permit um this event permit would
 
06:11:25.110 --> 06:11:25.120 align:start position:0%
would uh
 
06:11:27.910 --> 06:11:27.920 align:start position:0%
we we issued these event permits and
 
06:11:30.390 --> 06:11:30.400 align:start position:0%
part of the permit is that they have to
 
06:11:31.990 --> 06:11:32.000 align:start position:0%
let the
 
06:11:34.070 --> 06:11:34.080 align:start position:0%
town or city for which the event is
 
06:11:36.548 --> 06:11:36.558 align:start position:0%
taking place in
 
06:11:38.708 --> 06:11:38.718 align:start position:0%
either be the selectmen's office the
 
06:11:41.750 --> 06:11:41.760 align:start position:0%
town itself and town law enforcement
 
06:11:44.230 --> 06:11:44.240 align:start position:0%
city law enforcement so if it were a
 
06:11:47.430 --> 06:11:47.440 align:start position:0%
large event we would require this event
 
06:11:50.310 --> 06:11:50.320 align:start position:0%
permit um but outside of that
 
06:11:52.390 --> 06:11:52.400 align:start position:0%
it would be no different than
 
06:11:55.030 --> 06:11:55.040 align:start position:0%
um you know ice fishermen or or anybody
 
06:11:59.110 --> 06:11:59.120 align:start position:0%
else recreating on that body of water
 
06:12:00.390 --> 06:12:00.400 align:start position:0%
and they would be up it would be up to
 
06:12:02.788 --> 06:12:02.798 align:start position:0%
them to take care of their own
 
06:12:04.948 --> 06:12:04.958 align:start position:0%
trash and such
 
06:12:08.390 --> 06:12:08.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:12:10.708 --> 06:12:10.718 align:start position:0%
sir you have representative kelly
 
06:12:15.030 --> 06:12:15.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:12:16.708 --> 06:12:16.718 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you captain
 
06:12:19.030 --> 06:12:19.040 align:start position:0%
easton for being here um my question uh
 
06:12:21.270 --> 06:12:21.280 align:start position:0%
i'm pretty new to this so uh could you
 
06:12:23.750 --> 06:12:23.760 align:start position:0%
just describe the general um rules
 
06:12:25.910 --> 06:12:25.920 align:start position:0%
making process like how would a citizen
 
06:12:27.110 --> 06:12:27.120 align:start position:0%
raise a
 
06:12:28.548 --> 06:12:28.558 align:start position:0%
you know a certain
 
06:12:31.510 --> 06:12:31.520 align:start position:0%
body of water a certain area as a
 
06:12:32.948 --> 06:12:32.958 align:start position:0%
problem that's growing or something or
 
06:12:35.990 --> 06:12:36.000 align:start position:0%
how would that process go through
 
06:12:39.030 --> 06:12:39.040 align:start position:0%
so the the administrative uh rule
 
06:12:41.030 --> 06:12:41.040 align:start position:0%
process uh
 
06:12:42.150 --> 06:12:42.160 align:start position:0%
each year
 
06:12:43.430 --> 06:12:43.440 align:start position:0%
uh or
 
06:12:45.350 --> 06:12:45.360 align:start position:0%
dependent upon what uh
 
06:12:48.070 --> 06:12:48.080 align:start position:0%
what section of um
 
06:12:50.628 --> 06:12:50.638 align:start position:0%
fish and game uh you know division was
 
06:12:52.310 --> 06:12:52.320 align:start position:0%
coming up with rules sometimes every
 
06:12:53.350 --> 06:12:53.360 align:start position:0%
other year
 
06:12:56.310 --> 06:12:56.320 align:start position:0%
but they would contact us
 
06:12:58.868 --> 06:12:58.878 align:start position:0%
the director's office or the commission
 
06:13:00.230 --> 06:13:00.240 align:start position:0%
with a proposal
 
06:13:02.070 --> 06:13:02.080 align:start position:0%
there are monthly commission meetings
 
06:13:04.708 --> 06:13:04.718 align:start position:0%
where they can voice issues
 
06:13:06.230 --> 06:13:06.240 align:start position:0%
such as this
 
06:13:08.390 --> 06:13:08.400 align:start position:0%
and then we would um
 
06:13:09.990 --> 06:13:10.000 align:start position:0%
certainly there are sections of our
 
06:13:11.910 --> 06:13:11.920 align:start position:0%
administrative rules for
 
06:13:14.708 --> 06:13:14.718 align:start position:0%
uh different type of wildlife fisheries
 
06:13:18.070 --> 06:13:18.080 align:start position:0%
uh hrvs things of that nature um and
 
06:13:20.548 --> 06:13:20.558 align:start position:0%
they could you know propose that that
 
06:13:21.750 --> 06:13:21.760 align:start position:0%
they that
 
06:13:24.708 --> 06:13:24.718 align:start position:0%
if there's an issue that we can um
 
06:13:26.548 --> 06:13:26.558 align:start position:0%
you know
 
06:13:28.948 --> 06:13:28.958 align:start position:0%
take care of that issue per se um you
 
06:13:30.548 --> 06:13:30.558 align:start position:0%
know for instance if it were a fisheries
 
06:13:32.310 --> 06:13:32.320 align:start position:0%
type of thing it may be limiting the
 
06:13:33.350 --> 06:13:33.360 align:start position:0%
number of
 
06:13:35.270 --> 06:13:35.280 align:start position:0%
bass being taken on a certain body of
 
06:13:37.110 --> 06:13:37.120 align:start position:0%
water something like that
 
06:13:38.948 --> 06:13:38.958 align:start position:0%
and that would be no different
 
06:13:40.470 --> 06:13:40.480 align:start position:0%
into the ohrv section of the
 
06:13:43.270 --> 06:13:43.280 align:start position:0%
administrative rules um it would then
 
06:13:45.750 --> 06:13:45.760 align:start position:0%
once that rule is proposed and as agreed
 
06:13:47.030 --> 06:13:47.040 align:start position:0%
upon by the commission and the
 
06:13:49.030 --> 06:13:49.040 align:start position:0%
director's office it would then go to uh
 
06:13:50.390 --> 06:13:50.400 align:start position:0%
the jail car
 
06:13:54.070 --> 06:13:54.080 align:start position:0%
a rule process um so that it became a a
 
06:13:56.470 --> 06:13:56.480 align:start position:0%
rule within our
 
06:13:56.480 --> 06:13:58.740 align:start position:0%
rule within our
fis

06:13:58.740 --> 06:13:58.750 align:start position:0%
fis
 
06:13:58.750 --> 06:13:59.910 align:start position:0%
fis
[Music]

06:13:59.910 --> 06:13:59.920 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
06:14:04.470 --> 06:14:04.480 align:start position:0%
just a quick follow-up chair mr chairman
 
06:14:05.990 --> 06:14:06.000 align:start position:0%
so just to follow up
 
06:14:08.628 --> 06:14:08.638 align:start position:0%
are you aware of anyone raising this
 
06:14:11.430 --> 06:14:11.440 align:start position:0%
issue with rhode marsh before this law
 
06:14:15.590 --> 06:14:15.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:14:15.600 --> 06:14:16.788 align:start position:0%
 
this

06:14:16.788 --> 06:14:16.798 align:start position:0%
this
 
06:14:19.990 --> 06:14:20.000 align:start position:0%
issue uh i know the residents around the
 
06:14:21.910 --> 06:14:21.920 align:start position:0%
pond had called
 
06:14:23.670 --> 06:14:23.680 align:start position:0%
the concord police department and fish
 
06:14:25.430 --> 06:14:25.440 align:start position:0%
and game about the issue
 
06:14:28.150 --> 06:14:28.160 align:start position:0%
um and certainly we responded multiple
 
06:14:30.868 --> 06:14:30.878 align:start position:0%
times to the area where the officers
 
06:14:33.830 --> 06:14:33.840 align:start position:0%
found that you know certainly any
 
06:14:37.270 --> 06:14:37.280 align:start position:0%
operation of any um you know motorized
 
06:14:39.590 --> 06:14:39.600 align:start position:0%
vehicle or device is going to have some
 
06:14:41.030 --> 06:14:41.040 align:start position:0%
sort of a noise
 
06:14:42.150 --> 06:14:42.160 align:start position:0%
um but
 
06:14:44.788 --> 06:14:44.798 align:start position:0%
you know and we have rules and laws that
 
06:14:46.948 --> 06:14:46.958 align:start position:0%
actually speak about the decibels that
 
06:14:48.948 --> 06:14:48.958 align:start position:0%
can be um
 
06:14:52.070 --> 06:14:52.080 align:start position:0%
that are allowable and you know
 
06:14:54.070 --> 06:14:54.080 align:start position:0%
flash excuse me flame arresters and
 
06:14:55.430 --> 06:14:55.440 align:start position:0%
things like that that need to be on the
 
06:14:57.270 --> 06:14:57.280 align:start position:0%
vehicles which can you know make it
 
06:14:59.910 --> 06:14:59.920 align:start position:0%
louder um so certainly our officers went
 
06:15:02.390 --> 06:15:02.400 align:start position:0%
down and found no issues
 
06:15:04.390 --> 06:15:04.400 align:start position:0%
they also need registrations to operate
 
06:15:07.270 --> 06:15:07.280 align:start position:0%
on these bodies of water um and we found
 
06:15:08.948 --> 06:15:08.958 align:start position:0%
other than
 
06:15:11.830 --> 06:15:11.840 align:start position:0%
people that did not like noise
 
06:15:13.190 --> 06:15:13.200 align:start position:0%
outside of that there were no
 
06:15:15.430 --> 06:15:15.440 align:start position:0%
illegalities going on
 
06:15:18.708 --> 06:15:18.718 align:start position:0%
out on the out on the ice
 
06:15:20.868 --> 06:15:20.878 align:start position:0%
just i just want to clarify my question
 
06:15:22.548 --> 06:15:22.558 align:start position:0%
if i could mr chair
 
06:15:25.190 --> 06:15:25.200 align:start position:0%
all right clarification
 
06:15:26.948 --> 06:15:26.958 align:start position:0%
i just just won did anyone bring it to
 
06:15:28.230 --> 06:15:28.240 align:start position:0%
the rules process that you were
 
06:15:29.750 --> 06:15:29.760 align:start position:0%
describing before though did any
 
06:15:33.030 --> 06:15:33.040 align:start position:0%

um it's a

06:18:41.510 --> 06:18:41.520 align:start position:0%
um not only is house bill 571
 
06:18:43.270 --> 06:18:43.280 align:start position:0%
incompatible with the intended use of
 
06:18:45.990 --> 06:18:46.000 align:start position:0%
this impounded area
 
06:18:48.628 --> 06:18:48.638 align:start position:0%
by expecting to use the martian winter
 
06:18:50.470 --> 06:18:50.480 align:start position:0%
for motorcycle racing in a residential
 
06:18:51.910 --> 06:18:51.920 align:start position:0%
neighborhood it's inconsiderate to the
 
06:18:53.990 --> 06:18:54.000 align:start position:0%
neighbors and landowners within a 1.5
 
06:18:56.830 --> 06:18:56.840 align:start position:0%
mile radius of the edges of the
 
06:18:59.830 --> 06:18:59.840 align:start position:0%
marsh many other visitors visit from in
 
06:19:01.910 --> 06:19:01.920 align:start position:0%
and out of state um to look at wildlife
 
06:19:02.788 --> 06:19:02.798 align:start position:0%
you know there are a lot of people who
 
06:19:04.628 --> 06:19:04.638 align:start position:0%
come to the marsh to do things that
 
06:19:06.548 --> 06:19:06.558 align:start position:0%
don't involve making large amounts of
 
06:19:06.558 --> 06:19:10.030 align:start position:0%
don't involve making large amounts of
noise

06:19:10.030 --> 06:19:10.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:19:12.390 --> 06:19:12.400 align:start position:0%
wildlife recreation actually um
 
06:19:13.990 --> 06:19:14.000 align:start position:0%
according to a study on the fishing
 
06:19:17.590 --> 06:19:17.600 align:start position:0%
wildlife fish and game website um
 
06:19:19.830 --> 06:19:19.840 align:start position:0%
7.6 million user days of wildlife
 
06:19:21.430 --> 06:19:21.440 align:start position:0%
recreation in new hampshire occurred in
 
06:19:24.430 --> 06:19:24.440 align:start position:0%
one year in 2011. there were
 
06:19:27.670 --> 06:19:27.680 align:start position:0%
630 000 people watching wildlife in new
 
06:19:27.680 --> 06:19:28.948 align:start position:0%
630 000 people watching wildlife in new
hampshire

06:19:28.948 --> 06:19:28.958 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
06:19:30.708 --> 06:19:30.718 align:start position:0%
um what does this mean that wildlife
 
06:19:33.750 --> 06:19:33.760 align:start position:0%
associated recreation contributed 556
 
06:19:36.070 --> 06:19:36.080 align:start position:0%
million dollars in expenditures to new
 
06:19:38.788 --> 06:19:38.798 align:start position:0%
hampshire's economy in 2011.
 
06:19:40.910 --> 06:19:40.920 align:start position:0%
of this total hunters and anglers spent
 
06:19:44.788 --> 06:19:44.798 align:start position:0%
275 million wildlife watchers spent 281
 
06:19:47.590 --> 06:19:47.600 align:start position:0%
million dollars in addition to 112
 
06:19:49.110 --> 06:19:49.120 align:start position:0%
million dollars on food and lodging in
 
06:19:52.470 --> 06:19:52.480 align:start position:0%
 
06:19:54.470 --> 06:19:54.480 align:start position:0%
motorcycles were previously driven so
 
06:19:56.708 --> 06:19:56.718 align:start position:0%
loud on this marsh that it penetrated
 
06:19:58.390 --> 06:19:58.400 align:start position:0%
very loudly into the home surrounding
 
06:20:00.788 --> 06:20:00.798 align:start position:0%
the park the marsh and not just the ones
 
06:20:02.310 --> 06:20:02.320 align:start position:0%
you know that you can see visibly from
 
06:20:03.830 --> 06:20:03.840 align:start position:0%
white road
 
06:20:05.510 --> 06:20:05.520 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of other homes around
 
06:20:07.270 --> 06:20:07.280 align:start position:0%
the marsh that you cannot see from the
 
06:20:10.070 --> 06:20:10.080 align:start position:0%
parking lot at the marsh
 
06:20:11.750 --> 06:20:11.760 align:start position:0%
in 2020 several of these writers
 
06:20:14.230 --> 06:20:14.240 align:start position:0%
acknowledged that they were
 
06:20:15.590 --> 06:20:15.600 align:start position:0%
violating you know we've already talked
 
06:20:17.750 --> 06:20:17.760 align:start position:0%
in this meeting about last year's
 
06:20:19.670 --> 06:20:19.680 align:start position:0%
attempt to repeal the ban
 
06:20:21.110 --> 06:20:21.120 align:start position:0%
they acknowledged they were in violation
 
06:20:22.150 --> 06:20:22.160 align:start position:0%
of the speed limits and other
 
06:20:22.160 --> 06:20:23.430 align:start position:0%
of the speed limits and other
regulations

06:20:23.430 --> 06:20:23.440 align:start position:0%
regulations
 
06:20:25.110 --> 06:20:25.120 align:start position:0%
and it's dozens if not hundreds of
 
06:20:26.948 --> 06:20:26.958 align:start position:0%
homeowners that are affected not one or
 
06:20:28.708 --> 06:20:28.718 align:start position:0%
two people so
 
06:20:30.548 --> 06:20:30.558 align:start position:0%
the representative sponsoring this bill
 
06:20:32.390 --> 06:20:32.400 align:start position:0%
has not been completely informed about
 
06:20:34.788 --> 06:20:34.798 align:start position:0%
all of the dynamics
 
06:20:34.798 --> 06:20:35.670 align:start position:0%
all of the dynamics
um

06:20:35.670 --> 06:20:35.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:20:37.590 --> 06:20:37.600 align:start position:0%
it's like if you can imagine the sound
 
06:20:41.110 --> 06:20:41.120 align:start position:0%
of 10 or 20 or 40 motorcycles racing for
 
06:20:43.350 --> 06:20:43.360 align:start position:0%
hours on end it would be six to seven
 
06:20:45.990 --> 06:20:46.000 align:start position:0%
days a week for um
 
06:20:48.310 --> 06:20:48.320 align:start position:0%
about five months the reason that they
 
06:20:50.070 --> 06:20:50.080 align:start position:0%
choose this pond and that this pond is
 
06:20:51.510 --> 06:20:51.520 align:start position:0%
such an issue
 
06:20:53.830 --> 06:20:53.840 align:start position:0%
and it's been coming up for 20 years as
 
06:20:57.270 --> 06:20:57.280 align:start position:0%
an issue not just the past couple years
 
06:20:58.868 --> 06:20:58.878 align:start position:0%
the reason that they want this marsh is
 
06:21:00.948 --> 06:21:00.958 align:start position:0%
because it's a very shallow body of
 
06:21:03.030 --> 06:21:03.040 align:start position:0%
water so that means it freezes more
 
06:21:05.750 --> 06:21:05.760 align:start position:0%
quickly and stays frozen longer
 
06:21:07.750 --> 06:21:07.760 align:start position:0%
so they can start racing in november and
 
06:21:09.670 --> 06:21:09.680 align:start position:0%
they could go until maybe march
 
06:21:11.590 --> 06:21:11.600 align:start position:0%
depending on the weather
 
06:21:11.600 --> 06:21:12.390 align:start position:0%
depending on the weather
um

06:21:12.390 --> 06:21:12.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:21:14.310 --> 06:21:14.320 align:start position:0%
in the concord monitor article published
 
06:21:17.750 --> 06:21:17.760 align:start position:0%
on october 4th 2019 jim bully the mayor
 
06:21:19.430 --> 06:21:19.440 align:start position:0%
who had been hearing hearing complaints
 
06:21:21.350 --> 06:21:21.360 align:start position:0%
for years at that time
 
06:21:23.190 --> 06:21:23.200 align:start position:0%
he said the final straw for a lot of
 
06:21:24.788 --> 06:21:24.798 align:start position:0%
people was on christmas morning when
 
06:21:26.230 --> 06:21:26.240 align:start position:0%
folks were up trying to celebrate with
 
06:21:27.750 --> 06:21:27.760 align:start position:0%
their families and the motorcycles were
 
06:21:30.390 --> 06:21:30.400 align:start position:0%
racing around the pond on that morning
 
06:21:32.788 --> 06:21:32.798 align:start position:0%
um you heard testimony last year that no
 
06:21:35.270 --> 06:21:35.280 align:start position:0%
one races on christmas well it's not
 
06:21:35.280 --> 06:21:36.390 align:start position:0%
one races on christmas well it's not
true

06:21:36.390 --> 06:21:36.400 align:start position:0%
true
 
06:21:37.990 --> 06:21:38.000 align:start position:0%
um and it's like a chainsaw on your
 
06:21:40.390 --> 06:21:40.400 align:start position:0%
porch all day long
 
06:21:42.470 --> 06:21:42.480 align:start position:0%
so people ignore the rules and fish and
 
06:21:44.150 --> 06:21:44.160 align:start position:0%
game does not have the staff funding or
 
06:21:46.390 --> 06:21:46.400 align:start position:0%
capacity to adequately enforce their
 
06:21:48.470 --> 06:21:48.480 align:start position:0%
very own rules on every acre of the
 
06:21:48.480 --> 06:21:49.670 align:start position:0%
very own rules on every acre of the
state

06:21:49.670 --> 06:21:49.680 align:start position:0%
state
 
06:21:51.430 --> 06:21:51.440 align:start position:0%
when motorcycles were riding on the pawn
 
06:21:52.868 --> 06:21:52.878 align:start position:0%
in the past years they were actually in
 
06:21:54.628 --> 06:21:54.638 align:start position:0%
violation of fish and game rules
 
06:21:56.548 --> 06:21:56.558 align:start position:0%
homeowners nearby called the police but
 
06:21:58.230 --> 06:21:58.240 align:start position:0%
they were told to call fish and game so
 
06:21:59.990 --> 06:22:00.000 align:start position:0%
they called fish and game and were told
 
06:22:01.590 --> 06:22:01.600 align:start position:0%
to call the police
 
06:22:02.948 --> 06:22:02.958 align:start position:0%
and they would call the mayor of concord
 
06:22:05.430 --> 06:22:05.440 align:start position:0%
because they didn't know what else to do
 
06:22:08.470 --> 06:22:08.480 align:start position:0%
and finally challenges with enforcement
 
06:22:10.390 --> 06:22:10.400 align:start position:0%
which prevented any oversight of the
 
06:22:11.990 --> 06:22:12.000 align:start position:0%
excessive noise impact on the
 
06:22:13.590 --> 06:22:13.600 align:start position:0%
neighborhood keep in mind this is a
 
06:22:15.270 --> 06:22:15.280 align:start position:0%
residential neighborhood completely
 
06:22:18.150 --> 06:22:18.160 align:start position:0%
surrounding the marsh
 
06:22:20.310 --> 06:22:20.320 align:start position:0%
the motorcycle races also endanger and
 
06:22:22.708 --> 06:22:22.718 align:start position:0%
deter other visitors to the marsh so
 
06:22:23.990 --> 06:22:24.000 align:start position:0%
people living in the neighborhood or who
 
06:22:27.590 --> 06:22:27.600 align:start position:0%
want to visit and walk or snowshoe or or
 
06:22:29.750 --> 06:22:29.760 align:start position:0%
fish even can't do that and i will tell
 
06:22:32.230 --> 06:22:32.240 align:start position:0%
you this year i have seen ice fishers
 
06:22:34.708 --> 06:22:34.718 align:start position:0%
out on the out of the pond i've also
 
06:22:34.718 --> 06:22:35.590 align:start position:0%
out on the out of the pond i've also
seen

06:22:35.590 --> 06:22:35.600 align:start position:0%
seen
 
06:22:38.708 --> 06:22:38.718 align:start position:0%
um a snowmobile and an ohrv
 
06:22:38.718 --> 06:22:41.110 align:start position:0%
um a snowmobile and an ohrv
so

06:22:41.110 --> 06:22:41.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:22:43.190 --> 06:22:43.200 align:start position:0%
and they haven't you know it's one or
 
06:22:45.030 --> 06:22:45.040 align:start position:0%
two people so we haven't even made a

fuss about it i've already given her
 
06:22:50.390 --> 06:22:50.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:22:53.430 --> 06:22:53.440 align:start position:0%

this uh practice of riding on hoyt pond
 
06:25:52.400 --> 06:25:53.590 align:start position:0%
this uh practice of riding on hoyt pond
was

06:25:53.590 --> 06:25:53.600 align:start position:0%
was
 
06:25:56.070 --> 06:25:56.080 align:start position:0%
been a 40-year venture in other words
 
06:25:57.830 --> 06:25:57.840 align:start position:0%
it's not something that's been going on
 
06:25:59.190 --> 06:25:59.200 align:start position:0%
just recently
 
06:26:01.350 --> 06:26:01.360 align:start position:0%
uh what happened was um
 
06:26:03.110 --> 06:26:03.120 align:start position:0%
there was an employee of the city of
 
06:26:05.110 --> 06:26:05.120 align:start position:0%
concord i think she was the
 
06:26:07.190 --> 06:26:07.200 align:start position:0%
director of economic development and she
 
06:26:09.670 --> 06:26:09.680 align:start position:0%
bought a piece of land near white pond
 
06:26:10.868 --> 06:26:10.878 align:start position:0%
i believe she came from either
 
06:26:13.270 --> 06:26:13.280 align:start position:0%
pennsylvania in new york and didn't know
 
06:26:15.270 --> 06:26:15.280 align:start position:0%
that they've been riding on this pawn
 
06:26:17.430 --> 06:26:17.440 align:start position:0%
like i said for 40 years
 
06:26:17.440 --> 06:26:18.230 align:start position:0%
like i said for 40 years
and

06:26:18.230 --> 06:26:18.240 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:26:20.470 --> 06:26:20.480 align:start position:0%
she complained to the various people
 
06:26:21.910 --> 06:26:21.920 align:start position:0%
including the governor
 
06:26:23.270 --> 06:26:23.280 align:start position:0%
of the mayor
 
06:26:25.670 --> 06:26:25.680 align:start position:0%
and the mayor misspoke about notifying
 
06:26:27.030 --> 06:26:27.040 align:start position:0%
everybody from
 
06:26:29.270 --> 06:26:29.280 align:start position:0%
the conquered delegation and it went on
 
06:26:31.990 --> 06:26:32.000 align:start position:0%
and on and on but uh long and the short
 
06:26:33.350 --> 06:26:33.360 align:start position:0%
of it is um
 
06:26:35.670 --> 06:26:35.680 align:start position:0%
you know this bill or this amendment or
 
06:26:37.990 --> 06:26:38.000 align:start position:0%
change was slipped through the budgeting
 
06:26:38.000 --> 06:26:39.110 align:start position:0%
change was slipped through the budgeting
process

06:26:39.110 --> 06:26:39.120 align:start position:0%
process
 
06:26:41.510 --> 06:26:41.520 align:start position:0%
uh by senator feltus
 
06:26:43.590 --> 06:26:43.600 align:start position:0%
who represented concord
 
06:26:46.470 --> 06:26:46.480 align:start position:0%
uh prior to his gubernatorial race
 
06:26:46.480 --> 06:26:47.510 align:start position:0%
uh prior to his gubernatorial race
um

06:26:47.510 --> 06:26:47.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:26:49.270 --> 06:26:49.280 align:start position:0%
and the people that have been utilizing
 
06:26:51.030 --> 06:26:51.040 align:start position:0%
it and have been maintaining it and then
 
06:26:52.708 --> 06:26:52.718 align:start position:0%
been plowing the ice
 
06:26:54.708 --> 06:26:54.718 align:start position:0%
so ice fishermen can get out there and
 
06:26:56.788 --> 06:26:56.798 align:start position:0%
everything else approached me
 
06:26:59.350 --> 06:26:59.360 align:start position:0%
because i'm an ohrb enthusiast
 
06:27:01.750 --> 06:27:01.760 align:start position:0%
about this and and yes uh representative
 
06:27:03.750 --> 06:27:03.760 align:start position:0%
smith uh and i had talked a number of
 
06:27:05.510 --> 06:27:05.520 align:start position:0%
times along with uh captain eastman
 
06:27:07.830 --> 06:27:07.840 align:start position:0%
about you know various uh changes
 
06:27:09.510 --> 06:27:09.520 align:start position:0%
allowing them to use it but you know
 
06:27:11.270 --> 06:27:11.280 align:start position:0%
trying to be adapted
 
06:27:11.280 --> 06:27:12.628 align:start position:0%
trying to be adapted
um

06:27:12.628 --> 06:27:12.638 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:27:14.390 --> 06:27:14.400 align:start position:0%
you know i remember in the testimony
 
06:27:15.910 --> 06:27:15.920 align:start position:0%
there was some concern about the
 
06:27:18.468 --> 06:27:18.478 align:start position:0%
ecosystem but as as captain eastman said
 
06:27:19.350 --> 06:27:19.360 align:start position:0%
is that
 
06:27:21.030 --> 06:27:21.040 align:start position:0%
all the animals and so forth are under
 
06:27:23.830 --> 06:27:23.840 align:start position:0%
the ice and as far as um you know
 
06:27:26.230 --> 06:27:26.240 align:start position:0%
walking on the pond the merrimack valley
 
06:27:27.510 --> 06:27:27.520 align:start position:0%
trail riders
 
06:27:30.788 --> 06:27:30.798 align:start position:0%
have been maintaining it too
 
06:27:32.788 --> 06:27:32.798 align:start position:0%
as far as i know there's no organized
 
06:27:35.270 --> 06:27:35.280 align:start position:0%
races they may be running around quickly
 
06:27:37.190 --> 06:27:37.200 align:start position:0%
on it but there's no organization
 
06:27:37.200 --> 06:27:38.788 align:start position:0%
on it but there's no organization
involved

06:27:38.788 --> 06:27:38.798 align:start position:0%
involved
 
06:27:40.390 --> 06:27:40.400 align:start position:0%
and if someone made reference to all the
 
06:27:43.350 --> 06:27:43.360 align:start position:0%
spending uh looking dealing with nature
 
06:27:48.948 --> 06:27:48.958 align:start position:0%
on ohr views as of uh 2011 which is what
 
06:27:52.310 --> 06:27:52.320 align:start position:0%
um almost little uh nine years ago they
 
06:27:54.788 --> 06:27:54.798 align:start position:0%
did a study that there was 572 million
 
06:27:57.910 --> 06:27:57.920 align:start position:0%
dollars spent on ohrv use there was 9
 
06:27:59.468 --> 06:27:59.478 align:start position:0%
200 jobs
 
06:28:03.830 --> 06:28:03.840 align:start position:0%
261 000 in wages and salaries
 
06:28:06.310 --> 06:28:06.320 align:start position:0%
million excuse me and state local tax
 
06:28:08.468 --> 06:28:08.478 align:start position:0%
revenue was 52 million
 
06:28:11.030 --> 06:28:11.040 align:start position:0%
so i believe this bill basically wants
 
06:28:12.868 --> 06:28:12.878 align:start position:0%
to put it back to where it was and how
 
06:28:15.110 --> 06:28:15.120 align:start position:0%
it's been for the last 40 years
 
06:28:15.120 --> 06:28:16.070 align:start position:0%
it's been for the last 40 years
now

06:28:16.070 --> 06:28:16.080 align:start position:0%
now
 
06:28:17.270 --> 06:28:17.280 align:start position:0%
if the parties want to have a
 
06:28:20.070 --> 06:28:20.080 align:start position:0%
subcommittee where you know we try to uh
 
06:28:22.230 --> 06:28:22.240 align:start position:0%
work it out or with the various people
 
06:28:24.788 --> 06:28:24.798 align:start position:0%
then you know that might be a applicable
 
06:28:27.350 --> 06:28:27.360 align:start position:0%
thing mr chairman but you know
 
06:28:30.310 --> 06:28:30.320 align:start position:0%
you know i i have empathy for the people
 
06:28:32.468 --> 06:28:32.478 align:start position:0%
that don't like the sounds
 
06:28:32.478 --> 06:28:33.430 align:start position:0%
that don't like the sounds
but

06:28:33.430 --> 06:28:33.440 align:start position:0%
but
 
06:28:35.270 --> 06:28:35.280 align:start position:0%
you know they move into something in an
 
06:28:37.510 --> 06:28:37.520 align:start position:0%
area and then all of a sudden they it's
 
06:28:39.190 --> 06:28:39.200 align:start position:0%
not what they thought it was
 
06:28:41.110 --> 06:28:41.120 align:start position:0%
and i have a real estate license and
 
06:28:42.628 --> 06:28:42.638 align:start position:0%
anything outside of the home it's their
 
06:28:42.638 --> 06:28:44.708 align:start position:0%
anything outside of the home it's their
responsibility

06:28:44.708 --> 06:28:44.718 align:start position:0%
responsibility
 
06:28:46.708 --> 06:28:46.718 align:start position:0%
so um i'll leave it with that and i'll
 
06:28:48.390 --> 06:28:48.400 align:start position:0%
answer any questions that i can for
 
06:28:50.628 --> 06:28:50.638 align:start position:0%
people i just think that it's it's not
 
06:28:53.270 --> 06:28:53.280 align:start position:0%
really fair the way the process was and
 
06:28:54.468 --> 06:28:54.478 align:start position:0%
the finally
 
06:28:56.150 --> 06:28:56.160 align:start position:0%
is if we
 
06:28:58.788 --> 06:28:58.798 align:start position:0%
don't change this you know what's next
 
06:29:00.548 --> 06:29:00.558 align:start position:0%
someone doesn't like a boat on lake
 
06:29:02.628 --> 06:29:02.638 align:start position:0%
winnipesaukee driving by their
 
06:29:04.468 --> 06:29:04.478 align:start position:0%
10 million dollar home
 
06:29:06.548 --> 06:29:06.558 align:start position:0%
and then they want to outlaw boats i
 
06:29:08.390 --> 06:29:08.400 align:start position:0%
mean it's where does it end
 
06:29:09.830 --> 06:29:09.840 align:start position:0%
so um
 
06:29:11.190 --> 06:29:11.200 align:start position:0%
i'll leave with that and i'll answer any
 
06:29:13.350 --> 06:29:13.360 align:start position:0%
question anybody might have
 
06:29:16.150 --> 06:29:16.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:29:19.350 --> 06:29:19.360 align:start position:0%

we're only got 25 minutes left in the
 
06:31:09.040 --> 06:31:09.830 align:start position:0%
we're only got 25 minutes left in the
year

06:31:09.830 --> 06:31:09.840 align:start position:0%
year
 
06:31:11.590 --> 06:31:11.600 align:start position:0%
i think so
 
06:31:15.030 --> 06:31:15.040 align:start position:0%
okay my name is my name is james stever
 
06:31:17.430 --> 06:31:17.440 align:start position:0%
i live in concord new hampshire
 
06:31:19.110 --> 06:31:19.120 align:start position:0%
to the honorable chairman
 
06:31:20.548 --> 06:31:20.558 align:start position:0%
and committee members i've been in the
 
06:31:22.230 --> 06:31:22.240 align:start position:0%
butter of the hoy road marsh and a
 
06:31:24.548 --> 06:31:24.558 align:start position:0%
resident of east concord since 2011. my
 
06:31:26.468 --> 06:31:26.478 align:start position:0%
home was approximately one half mile
 
06:31:28.390 --> 06:31:28.400 align:start position:0%
from the marsh and i have enjoyed this
 
06:31:30.150 --> 06:31:30.160 align:start position:0%
natural setting in a rural part of
 
06:31:30.160 --> 06:31:31.270 align:start position:0%
natural setting in a rural part of
concord

06:31:31.270 --> 06:31:31.280 align:start position:0%
concord
 
06:31:32.868 --> 06:31:32.878 align:start position:0%
that is until the dirt bike started
 
06:31:35.350 --> 06:31:35.360 align:start position:0%
racing around it in the winter several
 
06:31:37.670 --> 06:31:37.680 align:start position:0%
years ago the annoyance grew steadily
 
06:31:39.830 --> 06:31:39.840 align:start position:0%
worse until two years ago when together
 
06:31:41.750 --> 06:31:41.760 align:start position:0%
with the other residents in my area and
 
06:31:43.590 --> 06:31:43.600 align:start position:0%
the city of concord we tried to put a
 
06:31:44.788 --> 06:31:44.798 align:start position:0%
stop to it
 
06:31:46.708 --> 06:31:46.718 align:start position:0%
this year it has been a pleasure to go
 
06:31:49.590 --> 06:31:49.600 align:start position:0%
outside and enjoy a quiet winter day
 
06:31:51.270 --> 06:31:51.280 align:start position:0%
without the annoying buzz of these
 
06:31:53.430 --> 06:31:53.440 align:start position:0%
machines droning on for hours in the
 
06:31:55.670 --> 06:31:55.680 align:start position:0%
background to see the skaters and the
 
06:31:57.990 --> 06:31:58.000 align:start position:0%
ice fishermen safely returning to enjoy
 
06:32:00.708 --> 06:32:00.718 align:start position:0%
the marsh as it was meant to be used but
 
06:32:04.230 --> 06:32:04.240 align:start position:0%
like a scourge hb 571 has been proposed
 
06:32:06.468 --> 06:32:06.478 align:start position:0%
to destroy the peaceful enjoyment of my
 
06:32:08.628 --> 06:32:08.638 align:start position:0%
property and that of my good neighbors
 
06:32:11.350 --> 06:32:11.360 align:start position:0%
once again i'm here to ask that it be
 
06:32:13.430 --> 06:32:13.440 align:start position:0%
resoundingly defeated in the hope that
 
06:32:15.350 --> 06:32:15.360 align:start position:0%
this threat will not become a recurring
 
06:32:18.548 --> 06:32:18.558 align:start position:0%
nightmare year after year let's be clear
 
06:32:21.110 --> 06:32:21.120 align:start position:0%
as to what motocross riding on a frozen
 
06:32:23.510 --> 06:32:23.520 align:start position:0%
pond means based on my eye and ear
 
06:32:24.788 --> 06:32:24.798 align:start position:0%
witness account
 
06:32:27.110 --> 06:32:27.120 align:start position:0%
this is an unmonitored unregulated
 
06:32:29.670 --> 06:32:29.680 align:start position:0%
continuously increasing number of
 
06:32:32.390 --> 06:32:32.400 align:start position:0%
essentially muffler list dirt bikes with
 
06:32:35.110 --> 06:32:35.120 align:start position:0%
spiked wheels driving at high speeds in
 
06:32:38.150 --> 06:32:38.160 align:start position:0%
circles on ice for hours at a time
 
06:32:40.390 --> 06:32:40.400 align:start position:0%
anyone who would suggest that that these
 
06:32:42.390 --> 06:32:42.400 align:start position:0%
machines do not create continuous
 
06:32:45.670 --> 06:32:45.680 align:start position:0%
barrage of high decibel noise
 
06:32:47.270 --> 06:32:47.280 align:start position:0%
is either death or speaking in the
 
06:32:48.788 --> 06:32:48.798 align:start position:0%
absence of truth
 
06:32:50.070 --> 06:32:50.080 align:start position:0%
and i provided a link with a
 
06:32:51.750 --> 06:32:51.760 align:start position:0%
representation of what it sounds like
 
06:32:53.190 --> 06:32:53.200 align:start position:0%
for the committee members in my
 
06:32:55.510 --> 06:32:55.520 align:start position:0%
testimony that i've submitted white road
 
06:32:57.270 --> 06:32:57.280 align:start position:0%
marsh is a wildlife management area
 
06:32:59.190 --> 06:32:59.200 align:start position:0%
whose stated primary purpose as
 
06:33:01.030 --> 06:33:01.040 align:start position:0%
identified on the fish and game website
 
06:33:03.190 --> 06:33:03.200 align:start position:0%
is to quote protect and improve habitat
 
06:33:05.430 --> 06:33:05.440 align:start position:0%
for wildlife you don't need to you don't
 
06:33:07.430 --> 06:33:07.440 align:start position:0%
need a degree in animal science to
 
06:33:09.990 --> 06:33:10.000 align:start position:0%
realize that any wildlife with
 
06:33:12.390 --> 06:33:12.400 align:start position:0%
auditory capabilities exposed to the
 
06:33:14.390 --> 06:33:14.400 align:start position:0%
disturbances of this of these machines
 
06:33:15.590 --> 06:33:15.600 align:start position:0%
which scatter
 
06:33:17.750 --> 06:33:17.760 align:start position:0%
far and wide to avoid this area even
 
06:33:20.070 --> 06:33:20.080 align:start position:0%
long after the machines have packed up
 
06:33:23.030 --> 06:33:23.040 align:start position:0%
and left it must be concluded that
 
06:33:25.750 --> 06:33:25.760 align:start position:0%
the concentrated motor crosstrack riding
 
06:33:28.390 --> 06:33:28.400 align:start position:0%
terrorizes and degrades wildlife habitat
 
06:33:29.670 --> 06:33:29.680 align:start position:0%
and is therefore completely
 
06:33:31.990 --> 06:33:32.000 align:start position:0%
contradictory to the stated primary
 
06:33:34.948 --> 06:33:34.958 align:start position:0%
purpose of this area the track area used
 
06:33:37.270 --> 06:33:37.280 align:start position:0%
for motocross riding on road marsh is
 
06:33:39.270 --> 06:33:39.280 align:start position:0%
entirely contained within the borders of
 
06:33:41.510 --> 06:33:41.520 align:start position:0%
concord and most severely impacts
 
06:33:43.590 --> 06:33:43.600 align:start position:0%
concord's residential area
 
06:33:44.948 --> 06:33:44.958 align:start position:0%
most of these residents and their
 
06:33:47.510 --> 06:33:47.520 align:start position:0%
representatives do not want the march
 
06:33:49.350 --> 06:33:49.360 align:start position:0%
specifically targeted by this
 
06:33:49.360 --> 06:33:51.110 align:start position:0%
specifically targeted by this
legislation

06:33:51.110 --> 06:33:51.120 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
06:33:54.070 --> 06:33:54.080 align:start position:0%
used as a motocross track how is it that
 
06:33:56.230 --> 06:33:56.240 align:start position:0%
those from out of town as well as state
 
06:33:58.390 --> 06:33:58.400 align:start position:0%
representatives from out of town can
 
06:34:00.628 --> 06:34:00.638 align:start position:0%
propose legislation which is not wanted
 
06:34:03.750 --> 06:34:03.760 align:start position:0%
here in a fair and just world shouldn't
 
06:34:05.670 --> 06:34:05.680 align:start position:0%
the representatives who believe this
 
06:34:08.070 --> 06:34:08.080 align:start position:0%
sport be allowed promote a suitable
 
06:34:10.310 --> 06:34:10.320 align:start position:0%
location in their own community and then
 
06:34:12.548 --> 06:34:12.558 align:start position:0%
let their residents decide if it is
 
06:34:14.868 --> 06:34:14.878 align:start position:0%
appropriate to do otherwise is an

gentleman mr stever if he had any
 
06:35:15.440 --> 06:35:17.430 align:start position:0%
gentleman mr stever if he had any

06:35:17.430 --> 06:35:17.440 align:start position:0%
conversations
 
06:35:19.350 --> 06:35:19.360 align:start position:0%
with fish and game about this and
 
06:35:21.990 --> 06:35:22.000 align:start position:0%
whether this is lack of oversight or
 
06:35:25.750 --> 06:35:25.760 align:start position:0%
fish and game and did anyone inform you
 
06:35:29.110 --> 06:35:29.120 align:start position:0%
about um being able to
 
06:35:32.548 --> 06:35:32.558 align:start position:0%
make a rules committee that would help
 
06:35:35.430 --> 06:35:35.440 align:start position:0%
to solve this problem
 
06:35:35.440 --> 06:35:36.628 align:start position:0%
to solve this problem
um

06:35:36.628 --> 06:35:36.638 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:35:36.638 --> 06:35:37.590 align:start position:0%
um
so

06:35:37.590 --> 06:35:37.600 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:35:40.150 --> 06:35:40.160 align:start position:0%
i did i did actually complain a few
 
06:35:42.868 --> 06:35:42.878 align:start position:0%
times about the noise um and it just
 
06:35:45.030 --> 06:35:45.040 align:start position:0%
sort of seemed like um
 
06:35:46.868 --> 06:35:46.878 align:start position:0%
if you called the
 
06:35:49.110 --> 06:35:49.120 align:start position:0%
concord police they would defer to fish
 
06:35:50.548 --> 06:35:50.558 align:start position:0%
and game and sometimes if you called
 
06:35:52.390 --> 06:35:52.400 align:start position:0%
fish and game they would kind of defer
 
06:35:54.628 --> 06:35:54.638 align:start position:0%
to the concord police to me that was my
 
06:35:56.390 --> 06:35:56.400 align:start position:0%
experience and then
 
06:35:58.948 --> 06:35:58.958 align:start position:0%
um i don't have a decibel level
 
06:36:01.350 --> 06:36:01.360 align:start position:0%
reader so i was you know maybe i should
 
06:36:02.468 --> 06:36:02.478 align:start position:0%
get one i've heard that they're pretty
 
06:36:04.948 --> 06:36:04.958 align:start position:0%
cheap so uh maybe that's if this starts
 
06:36:07.910 --> 06:36:07.920 align:start position:0%
again maybe i'll get one and um it just
 
06:36:07.920 --> 06:36:09.510 align:start position:0%
again maybe i'll get one and um it just
uh

06:36:09.510 --> 06:36:09.520 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:36:11.990 --> 06:36:12.000 align:start position:0%
i don't know i guess maybe if i complain
 
06:36:14.468 --> 06:36:14.478 align:start position:0%
in the future i should meet the fish and
 
06:36:16.548 --> 06:36:16.558 align:start position:0%
game officer in the parking lot and then
 
06:36:19.430 --> 06:36:19.440 align:start position:0%
i can record a video of them taking a
 
06:36:21.270 --> 06:36:21.280 align:start position:0%
reading of the machines but
 
06:36:23.190 --> 06:36:23.200 align:start position:0%
um they're very loud
 
06:36:23.200 --> 06:36:24.230 align:start position:0%
um they're very loud
so

06:36:24.230 --> 06:36:24.240 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:36:27.270 --> 06:36:27.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:36:29.110 --> 06:36:29.120 align:start position:0%

a lot of stuff's been covered by captain
 
06:37:12.948 --> 06:37:12.958 align:start position:0%
eastman i've actually lived in loudoun
 
06:37:14.708 --> 06:37:14.718 align:start position:0%
new hampshire which a lot of people
 
06:37:17.750 --> 06:37:17.760 align:start position:0%
don't realize that
 
06:37:19.750 --> 06:37:19.760 align:start position:0%
a majority of the marsh believe it or
 
06:37:21.270 --> 06:37:21.280 align:start position:0%
not the wildlife management actually
 
06:37:23.430 --> 06:37:23.440 align:start position:0%
resides in loudon and the residents of
 
06:37:26.070 --> 06:37:26.080 align:start position:0%
that area were given zero consideration
 
06:37:28.070 --> 06:37:28.080 align:start position:0%
um i've been working diligently
 
06:37:30.150 --> 06:37:30.160 align:start position:0%
diligently for the last nine years in
 
06:37:32.390 --> 06:37:32.400 align:start position:0%
terms of complaints and stuff that came
 
06:37:33.590 --> 06:37:33.600 align:start position:0%
in on
 
06:37:35.670 --> 06:37:35.680 align:start position:0%
on corresponding with fish and game on
 
06:37:38.070 --> 06:37:38.080 align:start position:0%
the concerns that were brought up about
 
06:37:40.708 --> 06:37:40.718 align:start position:0%
uh the motorcycle or specifically the
 
06:37:43.670 --> 06:37:43.680 align:start position:0%
ohrv used on hoyt road marsh
 
06:37:45.350 --> 06:37:45.360 align:start position:0%
um i've been i've been utilizing
 
06:37:47.750 --> 06:37:47.760 align:start position:0%
horrible marsh since i was a young child
 
06:37:49.910 --> 06:37:49.920 align:start position:0%
i was born in the 70s
 
06:37:51.670 --> 06:37:51.680 align:start position:0%
i've been there before whether it's ice
 
06:37:54.628 --> 06:37:54.638 align:start position:0%
fishing or recreating on the pond
 
06:37:58.230 --> 06:37:58.240 align:start position:0%
and so on and so on um i think that one
 
06:38:00.390 --> 06:38:00.400 align:start position:0%
of the my main concerns here is that
 
06:38:01.670 --> 06:38:01.680 align:start position:0%
primarily we weren't given any
 
06:38:04.070 --> 06:38:04.080 align:start position:0%
consideration to the opposition
 
06:38:06.868 --> 06:38:06.878 align:start position:0%
um when when this legislation was put in
 
06:38:08.310 --> 06:38:08.320 align:start position:0%
place by
 
06:38:10.468 --> 06:38:10.478 align:start position:0%
the inappropriate manner that it was
 
06:38:12.390 --> 06:38:12.400 align:start position:0%
um i've had conversations with senator
 
06:38:14.150 --> 06:38:14.160 align:start position:0%
feltes office
 
06:38:16.070 --> 06:38:16.080 align:start position:0%
you know the day after this
 
06:38:18.070 --> 06:38:18.080 align:start position:0%
legislation was passed
 
06:38:21.430 --> 06:38:21.440 align:start position:0%
um and prior to that i do have hard data
 
06:38:23.190 --> 06:38:23.200 align:start position:0%
correspondence which i've emailed to you
 
06:38:25.670 --> 06:38:25.680 align:start position:0%
guys in terms of the amount of time the
 
06:38:28.390 --> 06:38:28.400 align:start position:0%
usage and the frequency
 
06:38:30.310 --> 06:38:30.320 align:start position:0%
uh this practice that we do over there
 
06:38:32.310 --> 06:38:32.320 align:start position:0%
is unbelievably weather dependent
 
06:38:33.510 --> 06:38:33.520 align:start position:0%
there's been years where we haven't been
 
06:38:36.628 --> 06:38:36.638 align:start position:0%
there at all so i i strongly object to
 
06:38:39.430 --> 06:38:39.440 align:start position:0%
prior testimony relating to
 
06:38:42.310 --> 06:38:42.320 align:start position:0%
the uh the usage time and six days a
 
06:38:43.510 --> 06:38:43.520 align:start position:0%
week i mean
 
06:38:45.190 --> 06:38:45.200 align:start position:0%
i'm 50 years old and i go over on a
 
06:38:47.110 --> 06:38:47.120 align:start position:0%
sunday afternoon with my family
 
06:38:49.510 --> 06:38:49.520 align:start position:0%
um and and
 
06:38:51.270 --> 06:38:51.280 align:start position:0%
i've had full support from fish and game
 
06:38:53.350 --> 06:38:53.360 align:start position:0%
on this we've actually set up several
 
06:38:54.868 --> 06:38:54.878 align:start position:0%
meetings with
 
06:38:58.468 --> 06:38:58.478 align:start position:0%
uh the primary uh people opposing this
 
06:38:59.830 --> 06:38:59.840 align:start position:0%
to no avail
 
06:38:59.840 --> 06:39:01.270 align:start position:0%
to no avail
um

06:39:01.270 --> 06:39:01.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:39:03.590 --> 06:39:03.600 align:start position:0%
the the the correspondence i made with
 
06:39:05.670 --> 06:39:05.680 align:start position:0%
fish and game back in 2015 when this
 
06:39:07.190 --> 06:39:07.200 align:start position:0%
came to a head
 
06:39:08.310 --> 06:39:08.320 align:start position:0%
was actually
 
06:39:10.548 --> 06:39:10.558 align:start position:0%
uh encouraged by senator bradley at the
 
06:39:13.190 --> 06:39:13.200 align:start position:0%
time who was a senate majority leader
 
06:39:16.708 --> 06:39:16.718 align:start position:0%
um after approval from fish and game my
 
06:39:18.390 --> 06:39:18.400 align:start position:0%
correspondence was given to senator
 
06:39:20.070 --> 06:39:20.080 align:start position:0%
bradley and reviewed
 
06:39:21.830 --> 06:39:21.840 align:start position:0%
and determined that a lot of the
 
06:39:23.990 --> 06:39:24.000 align:start position:0%
accusations were unfounded we were well
 
06:39:25.670 --> 06:39:25.680 align:start position:0%
within our legal right
 
06:39:28.230 --> 06:39:28.240 align:start position:0%
and no further action was necessary
 
06:39:30.070 --> 06:39:30.080 align:start position:0%
we've actually made accommodations on
 
06:39:32.788 --> 06:39:32.798 align:start position:0%
our you know willingly to alleviate any
 
06:39:34.628 --> 06:39:34.638 align:start position:0%
pressure that people may have in terms
 
06:39:37.830 --> 06:39:37.840 align:start position:0%
of us recreating on that pond um we
 
06:39:39.990 --> 06:39:40.000 align:start position:0%
don't start our ohrv's until after 10
 
06:39:41.510 --> 06:39:41.520 align:start position:0%
o'clock in the morning
 
06:39:44.310 --> 06:39:44.320 align:start position:0%
and i can assure you 100 percent you
 
06:39:46.628 --> 06:39:46.638 align:start position:0%
know given my career choices i've made
 
06:39:48.468 --> 06:39:48.478 align:start position:0%
in in my life that i have a hundred
 
06:39:48.478 --> 06:39:49.910 align:start position:0%
in in my life that i have a hundred
percent

06:39:49.910 --> 06:39:49.920 align:start position:0%
percent
 
06:39:51.270 --> 06:39:51.280 align:start position:0%
respect for the resource that new
 
06:39:52.948 --> 06:39:52.958 align:start position:0%
hampshire has to offer
 
06:39:52.958 --> 06:39:54.070 align:start position:0%
hampshire has to offer
um

06:39:54.070 --> 06:39:54.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:39:56.230 --> 06:39:56.240 align:start position:0%
it it's we're being portrayed in an
 
06:39:58.948 --> 06:39:58.958 align:start position:0%
unbelievably negative light and i can
 
06:40:00.708 --> 06:40:00.718 align:start position:0%
assure you that there's zero racing
 
06:40:03.190 --> 06:40:03.200 align:start position:0%
happening on hoyt road marsh now do we
 
06:40:06.628 --> 06:40:06.638 align:start position:0%
plow an area to ride on absolutely we do
 
06:40:08.948 --> 06:40:08.958 align:start position:0%
uh snow is not our wish
 
06:40:10.948 --> 06:40:10.958 align:start position:0%
you know and it
 
06:40:13.590 --> 06:40:13.600 align:start position:0%
allows us to utilize our ohrv stickers
 
06:40:15.910 --> 06:40:15.920 align:start position:0%
more effectively considering that
 
06:40:18.150 --> 06:40:18.160 align:start position:0%
we are not allowed on snowmobile trails
 
06:40:19.910 --> 06:40:19.920 align:start position:0%
and a lot of these trails are closed off
 
06:40:22.070 --> 06:40:22.080 align:start position:0%
for trail bikes which is my particular
 
06:40:25.430 --> 06:40:25.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:40:25.440 --> 06:40:26.548 align:start position:0%
 
so so

06:40:26.548 --> 06:40:26.558 align:start position:0%
so so
 
06:40:28.390 --> 06:40:28.400 align:start position:0%
a frozen body of water which becomes a
 
06:40:30.230 --> 06:40:30.240 align:start position:0%
public right away in the winter
 
06:40:32.070 --> 06:40:32.080 align:start position:0%
was it was a way for us to go there
 
06:40:33.910 --> 06:40:33.920 align:start position:0%
there i could name off a dozen other
 
06:40:35.510 --> 06:40:35.520 align:start position:0%
ponds and lakes in new hampshire that
 
06:40:37.190 --> 06:40:37.200 align:start position:0%
this has been happening on
 
06:40:39.030 --> 06:40:39.040 align:start position:0%
since my childhood it's not an
 
06:40:41.670 --> 06:40:41.680 align:start position:0%
unfrequent event
 
06:40:44.070 --> 06:40:44.080 align:start position:0%
yes i'm sorry i'm and i'll close at that
 
06:40:46.070 --> 06:40:46.080 align:start position:0%
and i apologize but i have emailed you
 
06:40:47.510 --> 06:40:47.520 align:start position:0%

chairman uh committee members i i
 
06:41:48.478 --> 06:41:49.670 align:start position:0%
chairman uh committee members i i
submitted

06:41:49.670 --> 06:41:49.680 align:start position:0%
submitted
 
06:41:51.190 --> 06:41:51.200 align:start position:0%
last night and i hope you all got a
 
06:41:55.030 --> 06:41:55.040 align:start position:0%
packet that i uh with a statement
 
06:41:58.070 --> 06:41:58.080 align:start position:0%
my my testimony relates to my analysis
 
06:42:01.030 --> 06:42:01.040 align:start position:0%
of the regulations it's fairly detailed
 
06:42:02.788 --> 06:42:02.798 align:start position:0%
which i provided
 
06:42:04.390 --> 06:42:04.400 align:start position:0%
and i actually disagree
 
06:42:05.990 --> 06:42:06.000 align:start position:0%
with the testimony
 
06:42:09.110 --> 06:42:09.120 align:start position:0%
um of officer eastman or or maybe not
 
06:42:10.948 --> 06:42:10.958 align:start position:0%
disagree but like to supplement that by
 
06:42:12.270 --> 06:42:12.280 align:start position:0%
saying i think there's a
 
06:42:12.280 --> 06:42:13.830 align:start position:0%
saying i think there's a
misunderstanding

06:42:13.830 --> 06:42:13.840 align:start position:0%
misunderstanding
 
06:42:16.390 --> 06:42:16.400 align:start position:0%
uh and there's sort of an assumption
 
06:42:18.948 --> 06:42:18.958 align:start position:0%
that any frozen bottle of water over 10
 
06:42:21.990 --> 06:42:22.000 align:start position:0%
acres uh allows hrvs and i've looked at
 
06:42:23.750 --> 06:42:23.760 align:start position:0%
that statute and what i've submitted to
 
06:42:25.670 --> 06:42:25.680 align:start position:0%
you is the regulations make it very
 
06:42:25.680 --> 06:42:26.788 align:start position:0%
you is the regulations make it very
clear

06:42:26.788 --> 06:42:26.798 align:start position:0%
clear
 
06:42:29.830 --> 06:42:29.840 align:start position:0%
that um it's only bodies of water as
 
06:42:32.150 --> 06:42:32.160 align:start position:0%
defined under 271.20
 
06:42:34.628 --> 06:42:34.638 align:start position:0%
and the state itself has provided a
 
06:42:37.510 --> 06:42:37.520 align:start position:0%
publication that lists which bodies of
 
06:42:39.510 --> 06:42:39.520 align:start position:0%
water those entail
 
06:42:42.628 --> 06:42:42.638 align:start position:0%
and if you look on page 13 of the
 
06:42:44.390 --> 06:42:44.400 align:start position:0%
des list
 
06:42:45.910 --> 06:42:45.920 align:start position:0%
you will see that
 
06:42:47.430 --> 06:42:47.440 align:start position:0%
marsh does not
 
06:42:50.150 --> 06:42:50.160 align:start position:0%
meet the qualifications of a
 
06:42:52.310 --> 06:42:52.320 align:start position:0%
um of a great pond because it was
 
06:42:53.830 --> 06:42:53.840 align:start position:0%
artificially created now somebody
 
06:42:55.430 --> 06:42:55.440 align:start position:0%
mentioned that earlier the fact that it
 
06:42:57.190 --> 06:42:57.200 align:start position:0%
was a very shallow
 
06:42:59.430 --> 06:42:59.440 align:start position:0%
body of water it was a wetland until
 
06:43:01.030 --> 06:43:01.040 align:start position:0%
they put a dam in there it's very
 
06:43:03.910 --> 06:43:03.920 align:start position:0%
shallow that's why it
 
06:43:06.708 --> 06:43:06.718 align:start position:0%
it it freezes fast
 
06:43:09.030 --> 06:43:09.040 align:start position:0%
but in fact it is not
 
06:43:11.590 --> 06:43:11.600 align:start position:0%
it is not a great pond per the
 
06:43:14.948 --> 06:43:14.958 align:start position:0%
definition under 271 and if you look at
 
06:43:17.670 --> 06:43:17.680 align:start position:0%
the fish and game regulations 902.2
 
06:43:20.390 --> 06:43:20.400 align:start position:0%
uh it talks about ohrvs
 
06:43:22.628 --> 06:43:22.638 align:start position:0%
are prohibited on lands except and there
 
06:43:24.310 --> 06:43:24.320 align:start position:0%
are two exceptions and one is frozen
 
06:43:26.390 --> 06:43:26.400 align:start position:0%
state-owned waters as defined in
 
06:43:26.400 --> 06:43:29.030 align:start position:0%
state-owned waters as defined in
rsa27120

06:43:29.030 --> 06:43:29.040 align:start position:0%
rsa27120
 
06:43:31.190 --> 06:43:31.200 align:start position:0%
and it just doesn't meet that definition
 
06:43:33.350 --> 06:43:33.360 align:start position:0%
so there's a there's an assumption that
 
06:43:35.110 --> 06:43:35.120 align:start position:0%
this is a permitted use but by the fish
 
06:43:38.150 --> 06:43:38.160 align:start position:0%
and game's own regulations it's not
 
06:43:40.708 --> 06:43:40.718 align:start position:0%
uh it's been a problem for years uh is
 
06:43:42.468 --> 06:43:42.478 align:start position:0%
my understanding although i have not
 
06:43:45.190 --> 06:43:45.200 align:start position:0%
lived on that pond for years
 
06:43:48.230 --> 06:43:48.240 align:start position:0%
in fact when we built our house
 
06:43:51.910 --> 06:43:51.920 align:start position:0%
on that spot the prohibition was there
 
06:43:53.910 --> 06:43:53.920 align:start position:0%
and i have spoken to fish and game and
 
06:43:55.350 --> 06:43:55.360 align:start position:0%
one of the issues obviously is
 
06:43:55.360 --> 06:43:56.390 align:start position:0%
one of the issues obviously is
enforcement

06:43:56.390 --> 06:43:56.400 align:start position:0%
enforcement
 
06:43:58.788 --> 06:43:58.798 align:start position:0%
for them they are short-handed uh they
 
06:44:01.910 --> 06:44:01.920 align:start position:0%
get calls i've spoken to an officer
 
06:44:04.150 --> 06:44:04.160 align:start position:0%
who has said you know you you go out you
 
06:44:06.150 --> 06:44:06.160 align:start position:0%
cite somebody they just come back they
 
06:44:07.910 --> 06:44:07.920 align:start position:0%
ignore it you can't be everywhere at
 
06:44:07.920 --> 06:44:09.270 align:start position:0%
ignore it you can't be everywhere at
once

06:44:09.270 --> 06:44:09.280 align:start position:0%
once
 
06:44:09.280 --> 06:44:10.548 align:start position:0%
once
so

06:44:10.548 --> 06:44:10.558 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:44:13.270 --> 06:44:13.280 align:start position:0%
you know again just saying that i mean
 
06:44:14.948 --> 06:44:14.958 align:start position:0%
it's an enforcement issue that's one of
 
06:44:16.310 --> 06:44:16.320 align:start position:0%
the reasons why
 
06:44:18.868 --> 06:44:18.878 align:start position:0%
uh the concord needed to be involved
 
06:44:20.468 --> 06:44:20.478 align:start position:0%
the other issue that i wanted to just
 
06:44:22.310 --> 06:44:22.320 align:start position:0%
point out and it's been touched on by
 
06:44:22.320 --> 06:44:23.350 align:start position:0%
point out and it's been touched on by
others

06:44:23.350 --> 06:44:23.360 align:start position:0%
others
 
06:44:25.510 --> 06:44:25.520 align:start position:0%
is this is there are competing rights
 
06:44:27.430 --> 06:44:27.440 align:start position:0%
and people don't have the right to ride
 
06:44:29.910 --> 06:44:29.920 align:start position:0%
wherever they want and certainly
 
06:44:31.910 --> 06:44:31.920 align:start position:0%
even if it's a public way
 
06:44:34.310 --> 06:44:34.320 align:start position:0%
uh the ohrv statues talk about public
 
06:44:36.390 --> 06:44:36.400 align:start position:0%
ways being something that you cross not
 
06:44:39.110 --> 06:44:39.120 align:start position:0%
something that you uh spend time in a
 
06:44:40.788 --> 06:44:40.798 align:start position:0%
concentrated area going around in
 
06:44:43.270 --> 06:44:43.280 align:start position:0%
circles uh you know you're creating a
 
06:44:46.310 --> 06:44:46.320 align:start position:0%
concentrated sound but it's also the
 
06:44:47.910 --> 06:44:47.920 align:start position:0%
fact that this is there are other
 
06:44:49.670 --> 06:44:49.680 align:start position:0%
individual rights which are
 
06:44:51.590 --> 06:44:51.600 align:start position:0%
paramount in this state which involve
 
06:44:53.430 --> 06:44:53.440 align:start position:0%
the right to enjoy your land and quiet
 
06:44:55.110 --> 06:44:55.120 align:start position:0%
enjoyment that's something that's been
 
06:44:57.350 --> 06:44:57.360 align:start position:0%
around since the inception of this state
 
06:45:00.230 --> 06:45:00.240 align:start position:0%
and people have that right and so
 
06:45:02.468 --> 06:45:02.478 align:start position:0%
there needs to be that recognition that
 
06:45:05.510 --> 06:45:05.520 align:start position:0%
in some places you can't do this
 
06:45:07.830 --> 06:45:07.840 align:start position:0%
there are 680 roughly if you look at
 
06:45:10.788 --> 06:45:10.798 align:start position:0%
that list there are maybe 680 places in
 
06:45:11.830 --> 06:45:11.840 align:start position:0%
the state
 
06:45:14.310 --> 06:45:14.320 align:start position:0%
that meet the definition of a great pond
 
06:45:17.030 --> 06:45:17.040 align:start position:0%
mr summers your time has expired
 
06:45:20.310 --> 06:45:20.320 align:start position:0%

yes john messick uh loudon
 
06:46:25.590 --> 06:46:25.600 align:start position:0%
i've emailed the committee my testimony
 
06:46:26.548 --> 06:46:26.558 align:start position:0%
i would
 
06:46:28.230 --> 06:46:28.240 align:start position:0%
like to
 
06:46:31.590 --> 06:46:31.600 align:start position:0%
summarize it as briefly as i can
 
06:46:31.600 --> 06:46:33.590 align:start position:0%
summarize it as briefly as i can
um

06:46:33.590 --> 06:46:33.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:46:34.788 --> 06:46:34.798 align:start position:0%
one of the
 
06:46:36.788 --> 06:46:36.798 align:start position:0%
documents i emailed to you was a
 
06:46:38.868 --> 06:46:38.878 align:start position:0%
description of the marsh with
 
06:46:38.878 --> 06:46:40.708 align:start position:0%
description of the marsh with
photographs

06:46:40.708 --> 06:46:40.718 align:start position:0%
photographs
 
06:46:43.190 --> 06:46:43.200 align:start position:0%
the marsh itself is a hundred and one
 
06:46:43.200 --> 06:46:44.390 align:start position:0%
the marsh itself is a hundred and one
acres

06:46:44.390 --> 06:46:44.400 align:start position:0%
acres
 
06:46:49.830 --> 06:46:49.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:46:53.670 --> 06:46:53.680 align:start position:0%
it is contained in one square mile of
 
06:46:53.680 --> 06:46:55.350 align:start position:0%
it is contained in one square mile of
public

06:46:55.350 --> 06:46:55.360 align:start position:0%
public
 
06:46:55.360 --> 06:46:57.830 align:start position:0%
public
forests

06:46:57.830 --> 06:46:57.840 align:start position:0%
forests
 
06:47:01.030 --> 06:47:01.040 align:start position:0%
uh no houses are visible from anywhere
 
06:47:03.990 --> 06:47:04.000 align:start position:0%
on them the marsh except for one
 
06:47:07.990 --> 06:47:08.000 align:start position:0%
and that one person is an ohrv supporter
 
06:47:11.110 --> 06:47:11.120 align:start position:0%
um another document that i emailed to
 
06:47:15.030 --> 06:47:15.040 align:start position:0%
you is uh titled sound level testimony
 
06:47:16.788 --> 06:47:16.798 align:start position:0%
of residence
 
06:47:20.230 --> 06:47:20.240 align:start position:0%
it consists of a map
 
06:47:24.948 --> 06:47:24.958 align:start position:0%
and uh with the location of homes
 
06:47:26.948 --> 06:47:26.958 align:start position:0%
there are five
 
06:47:28.948 --> 06:47:28.958 align:start position:0%
homes identified
 
06:47:28.958 --> 06:47:29.910 align:start position:0%
homes identified
uh

06:47:29.910 --> 06:47:29.920 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:47:32.868 --> 06:47:32.878 align:start position:0%
of people who testified last year that
 
06:47:35.510 --> 06:47:35.520 align:start position:0%
the noise was excessive
 
06:47:38.868 --> 06:47:38.878 align:start position:0%
it also uh in in the key lists the
 
06:47:41.830 --> 06:47:41.840 align:start position:0%
distance from those homes
 
06:47:41.840 --> 06:47:42.628 align:start position:0%
distance from those homes
to

06:47:42.628 --> 06:47:42.638 align:start position:0%
to
 
06:47:46.390 --> 06:47:46.400 align:start position:0%
where the ohrv is operated
 
06:47:48.070 --> 06:47:48.080 align:start position:0%
there are also
 
06:47:51.910 --> 06:47:51.920 align:start position:0%
the locations of 11 other homes
 
06:47:53.190 --> 06:47:53.200 align:start position:0%
of people
 
06:47:53.200 --> 06:47:55.110 align:start position:0%
of people
who

06:47:55.110 --> 06:47:55.120 align:start position:0%
who
 
06:47:57.350 --> 06:47:57.360 align:start position:0%
submitted sworn
 
06:48:00.230 --> 06:48:00.240 align:start position:0%
notarized affidavits
 
06:48:03.510 --> 06:48:03.520 align:start position:0%
that the sound levels were not excessive
 
06:48:05.990 --> 06:48:06.000 align:start position:0%
and if i could generalize those
 
06:48:06.000 --> 06:48:07.670 align:start position:0%
and if i could generalize those
affidavits

06:48:07.670 --> 06:48:07.680 align:start position:0%
affidavits
 
06:48:10.150 --> 06:48:10.160 align:start position:0%
they some of them are next door
 
06:48:12.070 --> 06:48:12.080 align:start position:0%
neighbors of the people who have
 
06:48:12.080 --> 06:48:13.830 align:start position:0%
neighbors of the people who have
complained

06:48:13.830 --> 06:48:13.840 align:start position:0%
complained
 
06:48:15.830 --> 06:48:15.840 align:start position:0%
and they and in one case they
 
06:48:18.310 --> 06:48:18.320 align:start position:0%
specifically identify one of the
 
06:48:18.320 --> 06:48:19.910 align:start position:0%
specifically identify one of the
complainers

06:48:19.910 --> 06:48:19.920 align:start position:0%
complainers
 
06:48:19.920 --> 06:48:20.868 align:start position:0%
complainers
or

06:48:20.868 --> 06:48:20.878 align:start position:0%
or
 
06:48:24.230 --> 06:48:24.240 align:start position:0%
they live closer to where the ice riders
 
06:48:24.240 --> 06:48:25.510 align:start position:0%
they live closer to where the ice riders
operated

06:48:25.510 --> 06:48:25.520 align:start position:0%
operated
 
06:48:29.030 --> 06:48:29.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:48:31.750 --> 06:48:31.760 align:start position:0%
they could not hear the ice riders
 
06:48:34.708 --> 06:48:34.718 align:start position:0%
inside their homes
 
06:48:37.110 --> 06:48:37.120 align:start position:0%
sometimes but not always
 
06:48:40.070 --> 06:48:40.080 align:start position:0%
they could hear the ice riders outside
 
06:48:41.670 --> 06:48:41.680 align:start position:0%
their homes
 
06:48:43.830 --> 06:48:43.840 align:start position:0%
and when they could they did not think
 
06:48:46.150 --> 06:48:46.160 align:start position:0%
it was loud
 
06:48:46.160 --> 06:48:48.390 align:start position:0%
it was loud
so

06:48:48.390 --> 06:48:48.400 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:48:52.628 --> 06:48:52.638 align:start position:0%
sound levels um are subjective and they
 
06:48:55.670 --> 06:48:55.680 align:start position:0%
can be influenced by emotion
 
06:48:58.548 --> 06:48:58.558 align:start position:0%
um we couldn't measure sound levels at
 
06:49:01.430 --> 06:49:01.440 align:start position:0%
hoyt road marsh because of the ban
 
06:49:02.708 --> 06:49:02.718 align:start position:0%
so we
 
06:49:06.150 --> 06:49:06.160 align:start position:0%
conducted a sound level study at turtle
 
06:49:08.230 --> 06:49:08.240 align:start position:0%
town pond
 
06:49:09.090 --> 06:49:09.100 align:start position:0%
and um
 
06:49:09.100 --> 06:49:11.110 align:start position:0%
and um
[Music]

06:49:11.110 --> 06:49:11.120 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
06:49:14.548 --> 06:49:14.558 align:start position:0%
and to quickly summarize that test data
 
06:49:18.150 --> 06:49:18.160 align:start position:0%
uh we operated more
 
06:49:20.230 --> 06:49:20.240 align:start position:0%
trail bikes there than typically
 
06:49:23.670 --> 06:49:23.680 align:start position:0%
operated at white road marsh
 
06:49:26.070 --> 06:49:26.080 align:start position:0%
at a half mile distance
 
06:49:27.270 --> 06:49:27.280 align:start position:0%
we couldn't
 
06:49:29.430 --> 06:49:29.440 align:start position:0%
measure any noise
 
06:49:31.350 --> 06:49:31.360 align:start position:0%
from those bikes
 
06:49:33.670 --> 06:49:33.680 align:start position:0%
at a thousand feet
 
06:49:36.628 --> 06:49:36.638 align:start position:0%
they could not be detected inside the
 
06:49:38.548 --> 06:49:38.558 align:start position:0%
one of the homes
 
06:49:41.510 --> 06:49:41.520 align:start position:0%
as that was part of the study
 
06:49:41.520 --> 06:49:42.708 align:start position:0%
as that was part of the study
and

06:49:42.708 --> 06:49:42.718 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:49:45.910 --> 06:49:45.920 align:start position:0%
outside that house at a thousand feet
 
06:49:49.350 --> 06:49:49.360 align:start position:0%
the ohrvs were barely detectable only
 
06:49:51.750 --> 06:49:51.760 align:start position:0%
two decibels louder than the background
 
06:49:51.760 --> 06:49:53.030 align:start position:0%
two decibels louder than the background
noise

06:49:53.030 --> 06:49:53.040 align:start position:0%
noise
 
06:49:56.230 --> 06:49:56.240 align:start position:0%
a single automobile passing a hundred
 
06:49:58.390 --> 06:49:58.400 align:start position:0%
feet in front of that house
 
06:50:01.190 --> 06:50:01.200 align:start position:0%
was louder than the ohrv's
 
06:50:01.200 --> 06:50:02.468 align:start position:0%
was louder than the ohrv's
optimistic

06:50:02.468 --> 06:50:02.478 align:start position:0%
optimistic
 
06:50:05.430 --> 06:50:05.440 align:start position:0%
uh your time has expired
 
06:50:09.270 --> 06:50:09.280 align:start position:0%
i appreciate the testimony and that i
 
06:50:11.990 --> 06:50:12.000 align:start position:0%
have been looking at at some of the data
 
06:50:13.430 --> 06:50:13.440 align:start position:0%
you presented
 
06:50:13.440 --> 06:50:15.590 align:start position:0%
you presented
so

06:50:15.590 --> 06:50:15.600 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:50:17.830 --> 06:50:17.840 align:start position:0%
i'll entertain any questions
 
06:50:19.830 --> 06:50:19.840 align:start position:0%
uh i have not
 
06:50:23.110 --> 06:50:23.120 align:start position:0%
uh i cannot allow questions right now we
 
06:50:23.120 --> 06:50:23.990 align:start position:0%
uh i cannot allow questions right now we
have

06:50:23.990 --> 06:50:24.000 align:start position:0%
have
 
06:50:26.390 --> 06:50:26.400 align:start position:0%
approximately nine minutes left to be
 
06:50:28.070 --> 06:50:28.080 align:start position:0%
able to get the rest of the hearing and
 
06:50:30.708 --> 06:50:30.718 align:start position:0%
before they shut the system down
 
06:50:33.190 --> 06:50:33.200 align:start position:0%
thank you for your consideration sir
 
06:50:35.430 --> 06:50:35.440 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your testimony
 
06:50:35.440 --> 06:50:37.110 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your testimony
um

06:50:37.110 --> 06:50:37.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:50:39.590 --> 06:50:39.600 align:start position:0%
i am
 
06:50:39.600 --> 06:50:41.110 align:start position:0%
i am
recognizing

06:50:41.110 --> 06:50:41.120 align:start position:0%
recognizing
 
06:50:44.948 --> 06:50:44.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:50:46.708 --> 06:50:46.718 align:start position:0%
in opposition
 
06:50:49.350 --> 06:50:49.360 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i cannot give you 15 minutes i
 
06:50:51.750 --> 06:50:51.760 align:start position:0%
can only give you uh
 
06:50:54.788 --> 06:50:54.798 align:start position:0%
two minutes thank you
 
06:50:56.468 --> 06:50:56.478 align:start position:0%
suzanne pegg
 
06:50:58.150 --> 06:50:58.160 align:start position:0%
yes can you hear me
 
06:50:58.160 --> 06:50:59.350 align:start position:0%
yes can you hear me
yes

06:50:59.350 --> 06:50:59.360 align:start position:0%
yes
 
06:51:01.110 --> 06:51:01.120 align:start position:0%
thank you very much that's no problem at
 
06:51:04.390 --> 06:51:04.400 align:start position:0%
all um dear chairman horrible committee
 
06:51:07.670 --> 06:51:07.680 align:start position:0%
members um i was actually noted
 
06:51:10.390 --> 06:51:10.400 align:start position:0%
in the honorable flanagan's
 
06:51:12.708 --> 06:51:12.718 align:start position:0%
testimony earlier which is actually
 
06:51:14.628 --> 06:51:14.638 align:start position:0%
incorrect this is the first time i've
 
06:51:16.548 --> 06:51:16.558 align:start position:0%
actually stepped up to this it's been my
 
06:51:18.230 --> 06:51:18.240 align:start position:0%
husband's involvement
 
06:51:20.948 --> 06:51:20.958 align:start position:0%
up to that time you do have my written
 
06:51:23.590 --> 06:51:23.600 align:start position:0%
testimony i did email that to all of you
 
06:51:25.270 --> 06:51:25.280 align:start position:0%
committee members
 
06:51:29.110 --> 06:51:29.120 align:start position:0%
i do want to reiterate that the noise is
 
06:51:31.030 --> 06:51:31.040 align:start position:0%
it's really quite horrendous when it
 
06:51:31.040 --> 06:51:32.070 align:start position:0%
it's really quite horrendous when it
happens

06:51:32.070 --> 06:51:32.080 align:start position:0%
happens
 
06:51:35.510 --> 06:51:35.520 align:start position:0%
my concern is if if the ban is lifted
 
06:51:38.070 --> 06:51:38.080 align:start position:0%
we're all working from home in some way
 
06:51:40.150 --> 06:51:40.160 align:start position:0%
shape or form right now
 
06:51:42.468 --> 06:51:42.478 align:start position:0%
because of covert and don't know how
 
06:51:44.788 --> 06:51:44.798 align:start position:0%
long that's going to continue so whether
 
06:51:46.548 --> 06:51:46.558 align:start position:0%
you're schooling children or you're
 
06:51:48.390 --> 06:51:48.400 align:start position:0%
having to work from home
 
06:51:52.150 --> 06:51:52.160 align:start position:0%
if that kind of noise goes on i won't be
 
06:51:53.910 --> 06:51:53.920 align:start position:0%
able to work from home it will be
 
06:51:57.350 --> 06:51:57.360 align:start position:0%
mission impossible um i'm i am hearing
 
06:51:59.350 --> 06:51:59.360 align:start position:0%
all the same testimonies i heard last
 
06:52:01.430 --> 06:52:01.440 align:start position:0%
year when i was there
 
06:52:04.708 --> 06:52:04.718 align:start position:0%
um i really do want you to consider just
 
06:52:07.270 --> 06:52:07.280 align:start position:0%
how important this is at not just it's
 
06:52:08.548 --> 06:52:08.558 align:start position:0%
her home
 
06:52:12.868 --> 06:52:12.878 align:start position:0%
and um i really want to to see this
 
06:52:15.990 --> 06:52:16.000 align:start position:0%
ban in place because of that and again
 
06:52:18.390 --> 06:52:18.400 align:start position:0%
as colby continues and we're forced to
 
06:52:21.270 --> 06:52:21.280 align:start position:0%
be here at home it could actually make
 
06:52:23.590 --> 06:52:23.600 align:start position:0%
this a very uncomfortable situation if
 
06:52:25.830 --> 06:52:25.840 align:start position:0%
that ban was lifted
 
06:52:28.150 --> 06:52:28.160 align:start position:0%
so any questions you can always email me
 
06:52:30.230 --> 06:52:30.240 align:start position:0%

continue on skip a couple of areas on or
 
06:56:03.830 --> 06:56:03.840 align:start position:0%
about 2012
 
06:56:05.910 --> 06:56:05.920 align:start position:0%
legislation was introduced for a similar
 
06:56:08.868 --> 06:56:08.878 align:start position:0%
ban on a pawn in the town of milo and
 
06:56:12.150 --> 06:56:12.160 align:start position:0%
again on lake ossipee that legislation
 
06:56:14.150 --> 06:56:14.160 align:start position:0%
was rejected in committee
 
06:56:17.030 --> 06:56:17.040 align:start position:0%
possibly a forecast of why the unusual
 
06:56:19.270 --> 06:56:19.280 align:start position:0%
process of introducing the current ban
 
06:56:20.548 --> 06:56:20.558 align:start position:0%
was taken
 
06:56:22.788 --> 06:56:22.798 align:start position:0%
the prohibition we're asking to repeal
 
06:56:24.548 --> 06:56:24.558 align:start position:0%
was introduced by way of the state
 
06:56:27.750 --> 06:56:27.760 align:start position:0%
budget trailer bill to house bill 2 in
 
06:56:30.788 --> 06:56:30.798 align:start position:0%
2019. the bill was entered by the senate
 
06:56:33.030 --> 06:56:33.040 align:start position:0%
finance committee not by a formal
 
06:56:35.350 --> 06:56:35.360 align:start position:0%
process of the energy and natural
 
06:56:37.430 --> 06:56:37.440 align:start position:0%
resources committee which seems to be a
 
06:56:39.110 --> 06:56:39.120 align:start position:0%
much more appropriate body for the
 
06:56:39.120 --> 06:56:40.150 align:start position:0%
much more appropriate body for the
subject

06:56:40.150 --> 06:56:40.160 align:start position:0%
subject
 
06:56:42.390 --> 06:56:42.400 align:start position:0%
burden in that 300-page document the
 
06:56:45.030 --> 06:56:45.040 align:start position:0%
action was taken without public notice
 
06:56:46.390 --> 06:56:46.400 align:start position:0%
or hearings
 
06:56:49.190 --> 06:56:49.200 align:start position:0%
no consultation with opponents or
 
06:56:51.670 --> 06:56:51.680 align:start position:0%
proponents nor the state fish and game
 
06:56:53.830 --> 06:56:53.840 align:start position:0%
department which is the owner and
 
06:56:55.750 --> 06:56:55.760 align:start position:0%
manager of the property
 
06:56:58.468 --> 06:56:58.478 align:start position:0%
fish and game as the applicable agency
 
06:57:01.110 --> 06:57:01.120 align:start position:0%
was not asked for opinion on enforcement
 
06:57:03.030 --> 06:57:03.040 align:start position:0%
or opinion of the restriction to a
 
06:57:05.350 --> 06:57:05.360 align:start position:0%
defined recreational segment of the
 
06:57:08.390 --> 06:57:08.400 align:start position:0%
public or how that action might set a
 
06:57:11.190 --> 06:57:11.200 align:start position:0%
precedent for adverse action against
 
06:57:12.868 --> 06:57:12.878 align:start position:0%
other state properties
 
06:57:16.150 --> 06:57:16.160 align:start position:0%
not until the bill the state budget was
 
06:57:18.708 --> 06:57:18.718 align:start position:0%
approved and released to the public and
 
06:57:22.868 --> 06:57:22.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:57:25.990 --> 06:57:26.000 align:start position:0%
racing has been mentioned several times
 
06:57:27.910 --> 06:57:27.920 align:start position:0%
i believe it's probably a perception but
 
06:57:31.350 --> 06:57:31.360 align:start position:0%
no organized racing has ever
 
06:57:33.510 --> 06:57:33.520 align:start position:0%
nor is intended to take place on the
 
06:57:36.070 --> 06:57:36.080 align:start position:0%
marsh an organized event requires an
 
06:57:38.708 --> 06:57:38.718 align:start position:0%
event permit from fish and game
 
06:57:40.230 --> 06:57:40.240 align:start position:0%
