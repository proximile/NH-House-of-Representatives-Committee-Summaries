00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:34.720 align:start position:0%
okay good morning uh to those of you who
 
00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 align:start position:0%
are uh joining us thank you for uh doing
 
00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:41.120 align:start position:0%
so it's N9 o'clock I'm going to open up
 
00:02:43.949 --> 00:02:43.959 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee work session for House
 
00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:46.760 align:start position:0%
Bill 1504 relative to architectural
 
00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 align:start position:0%
paint recycling and with that I'm going
 
00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:51.200 align:start position:0%
to sort of just give an overview of
 
00:02:53.229 --> 00:02:53.239 align:start position:0%
where we were we heard this bill come
 
00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:57.640 align:start position:0%
before us um in committee and we
 
00:02:58.869 --> 00:02:58.879 align:start position:0%
obviously know that the intent of the
 
00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:00.400 align:start position:0%
bill was to stand up in architectural
 
00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:02.360 align:start position:0%
paint recycling program and a
 
00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:04.280 align:start position:0%
stewardship organization perhaps to
 
00:03:06.509 --> 00:03:06.519 align:start position:0%
oversee that
 
00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:11.640 align:start position:0%
um and the bill it uh as it looks to me
 
00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280 align:start position:0%
initially would establish some new
 
00:03:16.789 --> 00:03:16.799 align:start position:0%
subsections within 149 M which is our
 
00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:18.120 align:start position:0%
Solid Waste
 
00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:21.760 align:start position:0%
statute um I have taken the liberty and
 
00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:24.040 align:start position:0%
and uh Kristen grant our researcher is
 
00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:27.080 align:start position:0%
going to send out links to you all uh
 
00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:29.200 align:start position:0%
regarding a side bys side comparison of
 
00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:32.680 align:start position:0%
two pre previous iterations of um this
 
00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:34.680 align:start position:0%
bill that came before house environment
 
00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:37.400 align:start position:0%
and agriculture in 2014 one in
 
00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:40.840 align:start position:0%
2020 um as well as obviously we have uh
 
00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:42.640 align:start position:0%
the current language in
 
00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:46.400 align:start position:0%
1504 um she also was kind enough to pull
 
00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:48.360 align:start position:0%
up some statistics about architectural
 
00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:51.080 align:start position:0%
paint recycling across the country and
 
00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:53.840 align:start position:0%
gave some statistics there um as well
 
00:03:57.869 --> 00:03:57.879 align:start position:0%
and I believe she'll send that out um to
 
00:04:01.509 --> 00:04:01.519 align:start position:0%
folks to pull that up uh I don't Kristen
 
00:04:02.869 --> 00:04:02.879 align:start position:0%
did you were you able to send that to
 
00:04:05.149 --> 00:04:05.159 align:start position:0%
members yet
 
00:04:05.159 --> 00:04:06.869 align:start position:0%
members yet
or

00:04:06.869 --> 00:04:06.879 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:04:06.879 --> 00:04:08.509 align:start position:0%
or
great

00:04:08.509 --> 00:04:08.519 align:start position:0%
great
 
00:04:11.429 --> 00:04:11.439 align:start position:0%
yeah no no no that's perfect thank you
 
00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:14.280 align:start position:0%
so much um so with that I'm going to
 
00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:16.680 align:start position:0%
open it up to the to the members here on
 
00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:20.160 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee to um talk about I've
 
00:04:22.469 --> 00:04:22.479 align:start position:0%
sent you um links to the the previous
 
00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:24.600 align:start position:0%
pieces of legislation I've also sent you
 
00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:27.400 align:start position:0%
a link to what I'm going to call a
 
00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:30.960 align:start position:0%
guiding sort of organ ization with paint
 
00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:33.320 align:start position:0%
care would be a potential model for this
 
00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:35.120 align:start position:0%
type of program to be stood up in New
 
00:04:37.909 --> 00:04:37.919 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so that is also in your email
 
00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:41.320 align:start position:0%
inbox and with that I will um just look
 
00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:42.800 align:start position:0%
to the members to hear some thoughts and
 
00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:45.160 align:start position:0%
feedback from you all on first of all
 
00:04:47.469 --> 00:04:47.479 align:start position:0%
the hearing and and where you think
 
00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:52.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:54.680 align:start position:0%
1504 representative
 
00:04:57.990 --> 00:04:58.000 align:start position:0%
gerna thank you madam chair U so I I
 
00:05:00.189 --> 00:05:00.199 align:start position:0%
think that one of the benefit that we
 
00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:02.840 align:start position:0%
have in this case as we look at what is
 
00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:04.960 align:start position:0%
effectively a kind of extended producer
 
00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:07.000 align:start position:0%
responsibility is that you already have
 
00:05:09.749 --> 00:05:09.759 align:start position:0%
industry Buy in there is already as as
 
00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:12.360 align:start position:0%
we've seen we talked about and then as
 
00:05:14.469 --> 00:05:14.479 align:start position:0%
as the chair sent out uh some
 
00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:16.960 align:start position:0%
information for us so I think that this
 
00:05:21.309 --> 00:05:21.319 align:start position:0%
should be um relatively easy I say that
 
00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:23.600 align:start position:0%
advisedly but uh because we have
 
00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:27.160 align:start position:0%
industry buyin uh and support and I
 
00:05:29.189 --> 00:05:29.199 align:start position:0%
think Brad bipartisan support I think it
 
00:05:30.909 --> 00:05:30.919 align:start position:0%
it makes makes it a lot easier for us to
 
00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:32.960 align:start position:0%
move forward we have a couple of
 
00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:35.120 align:start position:0%
relatively recent attempts to do this
 
00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:37.360 align:start position:0%
that that we can kind of learn from so
 
00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:39.840 align:start position:0%
in any event I'm I I'm optimistic given
 
00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:43.000 align:start position:0%
all of that that we can find a way to
 
00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:45.680 align:start position:0%
work through the industry sponsored
 
00:05:47.909 --> 00:05:47.919 align:start position:0%
efforts to get to a point that you know
 
00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:51.560 align:start position:0%
we can make a real um real steps forward
 
00:05:54.469 --> 00:05:54.479 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire great thank
 
00:05:59.150 --> 00:05:59.160 align:start position:0%
you representative RAR thank you uh I I
 
00:06:02.309 --> 00:06:02.319 align:start position:0%
would just wondering who who in the
 
00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:05.960 align:start position:0%
industry uh was receptive uh to this
 
00:06:07.469 --> 00:06:07.479 align:start position:0%
bill who who are
 
00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:11.080 align:start position:0%
the um the manufacturers I guess the
 
00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:15.360 align:start position:0%
ones that that agreeing with um this Pro
 
00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:17.000 align:start position:0%
this type of
 
00:06:19.629 --> 00:06:19.639 align:start position:0%
program is that a question for the
 
00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:22.080 align:start position:0%
chair e either one I may have missed
 
00:06:24.029 --> 00:06:24.039 align:start position:0%
those discussions and those talks I just
 
00:06:26.469 --> 00:06:26.479 align:start position:0%
want to know what who's um agreeing to
 
00:06:28.909 --> 00:06:28.919 align:start position:0%
this sure I I think that the overall
 
00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:30.840 align:start position:0%
intent that we have seen historically
 
00:06:33.029 --> 00:06:33.039 align:start position:0%
there are currently um so so that you're
 
00:06:33.039 --> 00:06:34.309 align:start position:0%
there are currently um so so that you're
aware

00:06:34.309 --> 00:06:34.319 align:start position:0%
aware
 
00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:37.800 align:start position:0%
11 states and districts so 10 states in
 
00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:39.240 align:start position:0%
in the District of Columbia who have
 
00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:42.120 align:start position:0%
already implemented um a version of this
 
00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:45.440 align:start position:0%
program where um major paint
 
00:06:48.189 --> 00:06:48.199 align:start position:0%
manufacturers are participating in this
 
00:06:50.670 --> 00:06:50.680 align:start position:0%
program as a way to keep the um
 
00:06:53.230 --> 00:06:53.240 align:start position:0%
architectural paint out of landfills and
 
00:06:55.790 --> 00:06:55.800 align:start position:0%
in that um document there are a myriad
 
00:06:57.950 --> 00:06:57.960 align:start position:0%
of ranges of sizes of States from
 
00:06:59.589 --> 00:06:59.599 align:start position:0%
California to small states like Rhode
 
00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:02.520 align:start position:0%
Island in Vermont that are participating
 
00:07:06.350 --> 00:07:06.360 align:start position:0%
with industry um buyin for um
 
00:07:08.710 --> 00:07:08.720 align:start position:0%
stakeholders and the way it seems to be
 
00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:11.160 align:start position:0%
structured from what I can see is that
 
00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:13.840 align:start position:0%
an um an entity such as paint care which
 
00:07:17.070 --> 00:07:17.080 align:start position:0%
I sent you is is sort of
 
00:07:19.749 --> 00:07:19.759 align:start position:0%
the organization if you will that helps
 
00:07:22.589 --> 00:07:22.599 align:start position:0%
run it within the state so it is like a
 
00:07:25.629 --> 00:07:25.639 align:start position:0%
PPP sort of like a public private
 
00:07:28.629 --> 00:07:28.639 align:start position:0%
partnership with an outside entity um to
 
00:07:31.990 --> 00:07:32.000 align:start position:0%
do that work on on behalf of the the
 
00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.589 align:start position:0%
do that work on on behalf of the the
recapturing

00:07:34.589 --> 00:07:34.599 align:start position:0%
recapturing
 
00:07:38.629 --> 00:07:38.639 align:start position:0%
program thank you representative Kon uh
 
00:07:41.029 --> 00:07:41.039 align:start position:0%
yeah thanks for the opportunity to speak
 
00:07:44.629 --> 00:07:44.639 align:start position:0%
and to join you this morning um I'm just
 
00:07:47.469 --> 00:07:47.479 align:start position:0%
curious do we have any kind of ideas
 
00:07:49.589 --> 00:07:49.599 align:start position:0%
within the group on how we could execute
 
00:07:53.869 --> 00:07:53.879 align:start position:0%
a program like this to be more in line
 
00:07:57.270 --> 00:07:57.280 align:start position:0%
or how to do it in a New Hampshire way
 
00:07:59.990 --> 00:08:00.000 align:start position:0%
like do we have any ideas of
 
00:08:02.990 --> 00:08:03.000 align:start position:0%
like how we can structure it or the fee
 
00:08:05.430 --> 00:08:05.440 align:start position:0%
schedule is the industry going to help
 
00:08:09.550 --> 00:08:09.560 align:start position:0%
with uh the the general you know layout
 
00:08:10.589 --> 00:08:10.599 align:start position:0%
of the
 
00:08:13.110 --> 00:08:13.120 align:start position:0%
program um thank thank you to the member
 
00:08:15.670 --> 00:08:15.680 align:start position:0%
for the question I I also did have uh a
 
00:08:17.029 --> 00:08:17.039 align:start position:0%
couple of thoughts around that and
 
00:08:19.469 --> 00:08:19.479 align:start position:0%
questions myself so um thank you for
 
00:08:22.110 --> 00:08:22.120 align:start position:0%
bringing that up I would like to I'm
 
00:08:24.070 --> 00:08:24.080 align:start position:0%
curious to know whether not setting up a
 
00:08:26.469 --> 00:08:26.479 align:start position:0%
dedicated fund would make sense to
 
00:08:28.469 --> 00:08:28.479 align:start position:0%
ensure that the program was self-
 
00:08:28.479 --> 00:08:29.790 align:start position:0%
ensure that the program was self-
sustaining

00:08:29.790 --> 00:08:29.800 align:start position:0%
sustaining
 
00:08:32.070 --> 00:08:32.080 align:start position:0%
um and so that those funds I know that
 
00:08:33.949 --> 00:08:33.959 align:start position:0%
in previous iterations of the bill as
 
00:08:35.909 --> 00:08:35.919 align:start position:0%
I've gone through the research have
 
00:08:38.269 --> 00:08:38.279 align:start position:0%
required sort of an independent auditor
 
00:08:40.110 --> 00:08:40.120 align:start position:0%
to come in and make sure that the funds
 
00:08:42.389 --> 00:08:42.399 align:start position:0%
are available and maintained and it is a
 
00:08:45.509 --> 00:08:45.519 align:start position:0%
self-sustaining program um I am
 
00:08:47.949 --> 00:08:47.959 align:start position:0%
not um I do believe that it does
 
00:08:49.870 --> 00:08:49.880 align:start position:0%
reference some of that in the current
 
00:08:52.030 --> 00:08:52.040 align:start position:0%
piece of legislation 1504 but I think
 
00:08:53.389 --> 00:08:53.399 align:start position:0%
there needs to be a little bit more
 
00:08:55.670 --> 00:08:55.680 align:start position:0%
detail around that subject and around
 
00:08:58.269 --> 00:08:58.279 align:start position:0%
that concept so I'd like to see a little
 
00:09:01.630 --> 00:09:01.640 align:start position:0%
bit more of your thought followup uh
 
00:09:06.190 --> 00:09:06.200 align:start position:0%
yeah thanks for the followup um so I
 
00:09:08.430 --> 00:09:08.440 align:start position:0%
think I correct me if I'm wrong I think
 
00:09:10.590 --> 00:09:10.600 align:start position:0%
I heard you bring up in previous
 
00:09:13.949 --> 00:09:13.959 align:start position:0%
conversation the idea of maybe a pilot
 
00:09:16.990 --> 00:09:17.000 align:start position:0%
program for something like this so maybe
 
00:09:21.670 --> 00:09:21.680 align:start position:0%
if the group agrees we could uh support
 
00:09:25.069 --> 00:09:25.079 align:start position:0%
a pilot program to show proof of concept
 
00:09:27.670 --> 00:09:27.680 align:start position:0%
of how something like this would work in
 
00:09:31.030 --> 00:09:31.040 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and leave it open to uh
 
00:09:34.509 --> 00:09:34.519 align:start position:0%
different municipalities or transfer
 
00:09:37.630 --> 00:09:37.640 align:start position:0%
stations to see if this sort of program
 
00:09:39.870 --> 00:09:39.880 align:start position:0%
would work for
 
00:09:42.389 --> 00:09:42.399 align:start position:0%
them thank you to to the member for the
 
00:09:45.350 --> 00:09:45.360 align:start position:0%
question I yes I did mention that um I
 
00:09:47.630 --> 00:09:47.640 align:start position:0%
am curious to see how that might work on
 
00:09:50.630 --> 00:09:50.640 align:start position:0%
a smaller scale um there's a million
 
00:09:52.069 --> 00:09:52.079 align:start position:0%
different iterations of how something
 
00:09:54.670 --> 00:09:54.680 align:start position:0%
like that could work on you know one per
 
00:09:58.630 --> 00:09:58.640 align:start position:0%
County a few you know municipalities uh
 
00:10:00.389 --> 00:10:00.399 align:start position:0%
by popul ation I don't know so we'll
 
00:10:02.350 --> 00:10:02.360 align:start position:0%
we'll have to see how um something like
 
00:10:04.470 --> 00:10:04.480 align:start position:0%
that might might shape up but I'm not
 
00:10:06.230 --> 00:10:06.240 align:start position:0%
opposed to to looking at something like
 
00:10:09.430 --> 00:10:09.440 align:start position:0%
that in the second year where we're um
 
00:10:11.870 --> 00:10:11.880 align:start position:0%
it's it's pretty clear from the research
 
00:10:14.509 --> 00:10:14.519 align:start position:0%
um depending on the various states there
 
00:10:17.430 --> 00:10:17.440 align:start position:0%
are collection sites that range from for
 
00:10:19.870 --> 00:10:19.880 align:start position:0%
example in the uh state of Vermont
 
00:10:21.790 --> 00:10:21.800 align:start position:0%
there's 81 collection sites that have
 
00:10:24.389 --> 00:10:24.399 align:start position:0%
saved about 1.1 million gallons of paint
 
00:10:27.509 --> 00:10:27.519 align:start position:0%
out of a landfill and uh that's not
 
00:10:29.550 --> 00:10:29.560 align:start position:0%
withstanding potential you know
 
00:10:31.389 --> 00:10:31.399 align:start position:0%
if people are in fact dumping kitty
 
00:10:33.550 --> 00:10:33.560 align:start position:0%
litter and adding weight to the disposal
 
00:10:36.110 --> 00:10:36.120 align:start position:0%
fee um it's that is not enumerated in
 
00:10:38.430 --> 00:10:38.440 align:start position:0%
the data that I have but I imagine that
 
00:10:41.389 --> 00:10:41.399 align:start position:0%
even that portion would be a significant
 
00:10:43.030 --> 00:10:43.040 align:start position:0%
um exclusion from our current
 
00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:44.550 align:start position:0%
um exclusion from our current
landfilling

00:10:44.550 --> 00:10:44.560 align:start position:0%
landfilling
 
00:10:50.990 --> 00:10:51.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:55.190 --> 00:10:55.200 align:start position:0%
Penza thank you um so going through the
 
00:10:57.629 --> 00:10:57.639 align:start position:0%
paint care website which is fantastic by
 
00:10:59.030 --> 00:10:59.040 align:start position:0%
the way because it kind of describes
 
00:11:01.430 --> 00:11:01.440 align:start position:0%
sces a lot for it seems like for it to
 
00:11:03.389 --> 00:11:03.399 align:start position:0%
be effective I understand like you could
 
00:11:05.629 --> 00:11:05.639 align:start position:0%
do a pilot but for it to be really
 
00:11:09.069 --> 00:11:09.079 align:start position:0%
effective um you want to be you want to
 
00:11:11.870 --> 00:11:11.880 align:start position:0%
have these locations within you know 20
 
00:11:14.750 --> 00:11:14.760 align:start position:0%
25 mile radius um where people could
 
00:11:17.829 --> 00:11:17.839 align:start position:0%
drop off their paint um you know I
 
00:11:19.670 --> 00:11:19.680 align:start position:0%
didn't realize that this was such an
 
00:11:23.150 --> 00:11:23.160 align:start position:0%
issue until I started researching it um
 
00:11:25.670 --> 00:11:25.680 align:start position:0%
people hide those materials a lot uh and
 
00:11:27.590 --> 00:11:27.600 align:start position:0%
they and they're going in you know in
 
00:11:29.949 --> 00:11:29.959 align:start position:0%
with the regular landfill stuff so um
 
00:11:32.389 --> 00:11:32.399 align:start position:0%
and it creates an issue looking at the
 
00:11:32.399 --> 00:11:33.310 align:start position:0%
and it creates an issue looking at the
fee

00:11:33.310 --> 00:11:33.320 align:start position:0%
fee
 
00:11:37.710 --> 00:11:37.720 align:start position:0%
structure so it's it's not a tax it goes
 
00:11:41.350 --> 00:11:41.360 align:start position:0%
on the cost of the paint right okay and
 
00:11:42.670 --> 00:11:42.680 align:start position:0%
then that's my understanding in the way
 
00:11:45.190 --> 00:11:45.200 align:start position:0%
that this current bill is is is
 
00:11:46.790 --> 00:11:46.800 align:start position:0%
structured the same way correct and we
 
00:11:48.310 --> 00:11:48.320 align:start position:0%
heard in testimony I believe that it
 
00:11:50.350 --> 00:11:50.360 align:start position:0%
could range anywhere from I think 95
 
00:11:53.949 --> 00:11:53.959 align:start position:0%
cents to a195 se charge yeah it says
 
00:11:56.509 --> 00:11:56.519 align:start position:0%
here like you know you've got um let's
 
00:11:58.590 --> 00:11:58.600 align:start position:0%
look at Connecticut or Colorado they've
 
00:12:02.190 --> 00:12:02.200 align:start position:0%
got um larger than half a pint um
 
00:12:04.269 --> 00:12:04.279 align:start position:0%
smaller than a gallon 35 cents you know
 
00:12:06.910 --> 00:12:06.920 align:start position:0%
what I mean but one to two gallons 75
 
00:12:08.470 --> 00:12:08.480 align:start position:0%
cents that that's they have a fee
 
00:12:11.230 --> 00:12:11.240 align:start position:0%
structure in here so it's not a tax it
 
00:12:14.310 --> 00:12:14.320 align:start position:0%
doesn't go to the state and then um it's
 
00:12:16.030 --> 00:12:16.040 align:start position:0%
also of course not a deposit because you
 
00:12:17.829 --> 00:12:17.839 align:start position:0%
don't get it back it's used for this
 
00:12:20.230 --> 00:12:20.240 align:start position:0%
whole program here
 
00:12:25.150 --> 00:12:25.160 align:start position:0%
um yeah they don't manage this is like
 
00:12:27.150 --> 00:12:27.160 align:start position:0%
you can be part of that part of paint
 
00:12:29.389 --> 00:12:29.399 align:start position:0%
care right but they don't manage it we'd
 
00:12:32.790 --> 00:12:32.800 align:start position:0%
still have to you know incorporate or or
 
00:12:35.150 --> 00:12:35.160 align:start position:0%
develop this program here through this
 
00:12:37.550 --> 00:12:37.560 align:start position:0%
bill correct I think that there would
 
00:12:40.069 --> 00:12:40.079 align:start position:0%
need to be a structure enumerated in
 
00:12:42.110 --> 00:12:42.120 align:start position:0%
statute for the program to be able to
 
00:12:45.990 --> 00:12:46.000 align:start position:0%
exist at my understanding and I um I
 
00:12:47.389 --> 00:12:47.399 align:start position:0%
have the ability to communicate with
 
00:12:51.629 --> 00:12:51.639 align:start position:0%
some folks at paint care um and advanced
 
00:12:54.069 --> 00:12:54.079 align:start position:0%
codings there are there is the
 
00:12:56.430 --> 00:12:56.440 align:start position:0%
opportunity rather for them to submit
 
00:12:58.629 --> 00:12:58.639 align:start position:0%
data to the state to help facilitate the
 
00:13:01.350 --> 00:13:01.360 align:start position:0%
proc process of what's being collected
 
00:13:03.430 --> 00:13:03.440 align:start position:0%
and how much and those types of things
 
00:13:09.629 --> 00:13:09.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:13.230 --> 00:13:13.240 align:start position:0%
Endeavor representative gerana thank you
 
00:13:15.389 --> 00:13:15.399 align:start position:0%
madam chair so uh yeah I think that one
 
00:13:17.389 --> 00:13:17.399 align:start position:0%
of the really nice things about this is
 
00:13:18.829 --> 00:13:18.839 align:start position:0%
is that it can be done looking at the
 
00:13:20.829 --> 00:13:20.839 align:start position:0%
Pain Care website it can be done through
 
00:13:22.430 --> 00:13:22.440 align:start position:0%
retailers right so we're not talking
 
00:13:25.030 --> 00:13:25.040 align:start position:0%
actually about adding to uh the work
 
00:13:26.389 --> 00:13:26.399 align:start position:0%
that's being done at our landfills or
 
00:13:29.110 --> 00:13:29.120 align:start position:0%
our transfer stations uh and it is o
 
00:13:31.509 --> 00:13:31.519 align:start position:0%
minimizing significant amount of weight
 
00:13:33.509 --> 00:13:33.519 align:start position:0%
as M referred to you know the weight
 
00:13:35.030 --> 00:13:35.040 align:start position:0%
that is accumulated when you add
 
00:13:37.030 --> 00:13:37.040 align:start position:0%
materials to the paint to try to dry it
 
00:13:39.949 --> 00:13:39.959 align:start position:0%
out so uh and as the current bill refers
 
00:13:39.959 --> 00:13:42.069 align:start position:0%
out so uh and as the current bill refers
to

00:13:42.069 --> 00:13:42.079 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:13:45.550 --> 00:13:45.560 align:start position:0%
um of course I've lost my place in it
 
00:13:48.509 --> 00:13:48.519 align:start position:0%
now well basically you would when you go
 
00:13:50.710 --> 00:13:50.720 align:start position:0%
into buy paint if if the retailer
 
00:13:52.310 --> 00:13:52.320 align:start position:0%
participates in the program you go into
 
00:13:54.749 --> 00:13:54.759 align:start position:0%
buy paint you would get with that paint
 
00:13:56.749 --> 00:13:56.759 align:start position:0%
educational or instructional materials
 
00:13:59.150 --> 00:13:59.160 align:start position:0%
right so that when you are finished with
 
00:14:00.350 --> 00:14:00.360 align:start position:0%
this paint there's a little bit left
 
00:14:02.870 --> 00:14:02.880 align:start position:0%
whatever you can return it here and
 
00:14:05.509 --> 00:14:05.519 align:start position:0%
explain the process to people so to me
 
00:14:08.670 --> 00:14:08.680 align:start position:0%
that's an incredibly easy both for the
 
00:14:11.110 --> 00:14:11.120 align:start position:0%
the stewards of this program which are
 
00:14:13.710 --> 00:14:13.720 align:start position:0%
the industry and for consumers because
 
00:14:15.949 --> 00:14:15.959 align:start position:0%
when you buy the paint as I said at
 
00:14:17.910 --> 00:14:17.920 align:start position:0%
those participating retailers you would
 
00:14:20.389 --> 00:14:20.399 align:start position:0%
also be given Specific Instructions
 
00:14:22.150 --> 00:14:22.160 align:start position:0%
about how to return that paint right and
 
00:14:23.910 --> 00:14:23.920 align:start position:0%
so then you're paying a little bit extra
 
00:14:25.829 --> 00:14:25.839 align:start position:0%
for that gallon or half gallon of paint
 
00:14:27.829 --> 00:14:27.839 align:start position:0%
you get that information and then you
 
00:14:32.389 --> 00:14:32.399 align:start position:0%
return it that seems to me the kind of
 
00:14:34.110 --> 00:14:34.120 align:start position:0%
thing that is working in a lot of States
 
00:14:35.629 --> 00:14:35.639 align:start position:0%
right now and as I said it doesn't add
 
00:14:37.710 --> 00:14:37.720 align:start position:0%
on to the work being done at transfer
 
00:14:40.230 --> 00:14:40.240 align:start position:0%
stations or landfills uh and in fact
 
00:14:41.790 --> 00:14:41.800 align:start position:0%
will reduce some of the work they're
 
00:14:44.790 --> 00:14:44.800 align:start position:0%
doing because it's diverting um that
 
00:14:49.069 --> 00:14:49.079 align:start position:0%
material thank you for that I also um
 
00:14:51.910 --> 00:14:51.920 align:start position:0%
with regard to that that concept I I
 
00:14:53.829 --> 00:14:53.839 align:start position:0%
wanted to talk with the subcommittee a
 
00:14:56.590 --> 00:14:56.600 align:start position:0%
little bit about um whether or not we
 
00:14:59.310 --> 00:14:59.320 align:start position:0%
believe that this bill um enumerates
 
00:15:01.110 --> 00:15:01.120 align:start position:0%
whether or not the informational
 
00:15:03.870 --> 00:15:03.880 align:start position:0%
materials is provided by the program
 
00:15:05.910 --> 00:15:05.920 align:start position:0%
like paint care or if it is provided by
 
00:15:08.110 --> 00:15:08.120 align:start position:0%
the retailer that was a little bit
 
00:15:13.790 --> 00:15:13.800 align:start position:0%
unclear to me and okay and so my my
 
00:15:16.350 --> 00:15:16.360 align:start position:0%
understanding and other iterations um
 
00:15:18.749 --> 00:15:18.759 align:start position:0%
there were requests that the paint Care
 
00:15:20.509 --> 00:15:20.519 align:start position:0%
Program provide some of that educational
 
00:15:23.150 --> 00:15:23.160 align:start position:0%
material as part of that so that's just
 
00:15:25.389 --> 00:15:25.399 align:start position:0%
something that was curious to hear your
 
00:15:29.790 --> 00:15:29.800 align:start position:0%
thoughts on representative penda
 
00:15:31.710 --> 00:15:31.720 align:start position:0%
yeah so this is the section where I you
 
00:15:33.749 --> 00:15:33.759 align:start position:0%
know I've got a couple little red flags
 
00:15:35.910 --> 00:15:35.920 align:start position:0%
on so
 
00:15:39.910 --> 00:15:39.920 align:start position:0%
um so under uh
 
00:15:42.790 --> 00:15:42.800 align:start position:0%
five uh five effective six months after
 
00:15:44.710 --> 00:15:44.720 align:start position:0%
the effective date of the section A
 
00:15:46.749 --> 00:15:46.759 align:start position:0%
wholesaler shall not sell an
 
00:15:49.069 --> 00:15:49.079 align:start position:0%
architectural paint in the state unless
 
00:15:52.069 --> 00:15:52.079 align:start position:0%
the wholesaler acts as a collection site
 
00:15:54.829 --> 00:15:54.839 align:start position:0%
for architectural paint a wholesaler may
 
00:15:56.910 --> 00:15:56.920 align:start position:0%
meet the requirements of this paragraph
 
00:15:59.150 --> 00:15:59.160 align:start position:0%
by participating as a collect C site in
 
00:16:00.949 --> 00:16:00.959 align:start position:0%
a manufacturer collection program deci
 
00:16:03.069 --> 00:16:03.079 align:start position:0%
side in paragraph one and then it goes
 
00:16:05.910 --> 00:16:05.920 align:start position:0%
into you know a wholesaler shall distri
 
00:16:07.430 --> 00:16:07.440 align:start position:0%
point of sale instructions education
 
00:16:09.710 --> 00:16:09.720 align:start position:0%
materials and signage and
 
00:16:14.110 --> 00:16:14.120 align:start position:0%
such my only issue with this is I would
 
00:16:17.230 --> 00:16:17.240 align:start position:0%
love to make sure that we
 
00:16:19.870 --> 00:16:19.880 align:start position:0%
have the buyin
 
00:16:24.590 --> 00:16:24.600 align:start position:0%
from you know 80% 90% of the the folks
 
00:16:27.509 --> 00:16:27.519 align:start position:0%
that are selling this paint in the state
 
00:16:30.189 --> 00:16:30.199 align:start position:0%
like I don't want to force something on
 
00:16:33.030 --> 00:16:33.040 align:start position:0%
I don't I I mean I know that there's
 
00:16:35.389 --> 00:16:35.399 align:start position:0%
I've read and I know that there's a many
 
00:16:37.189 --> 00:16:37.199 align:start position:0%
manufacturers that are all on board with
 
00:16:40.269 --> 00:16:40.279 align:start position:0%
this um and some of the largest paint
 
00:16:42.030 --> 00:16:42.040 align:start position:0%
distributors but I just want to make
 
00:16:45.309 --> 00:16:45.319 align:start position:0%
sure that um we have that buying through
 
00:16:47.230 --> 00:16:47.240 align:start position:0%
the PE through our businesses here these
 
00:16:48.949 --> 00:16:48.959 align:start position:0%
private businesses in the state I think
 
00:16:52.829 --> 00:16:52.839 align:start position:0%
that's key before we slam down a mandate
 
00:16:55.150 --> 00:16:55.160 align:start position:0%
I I think that's important that you know
 
00:16:57.470 --> 00:16:57.480 align:start position:0%
we hear from them as well
 
00:17:01.110 --> 00:17:01.120 align:start position:0%
so yeah I appreciate that uh feedback
 
00:17:01.120 --> 00:17:03.510 align:start position:0%
so yeah I appreciate that uh feedback
thank

00:17:03.510 --> 00:17:03.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:05.990 --> 00:17:06.000 align:start position:0%
you represent I just wanted to say I
 
00:17:07.750 --> 00:17:07.760 align:start position:0%
agree with those sentiments as well
 
00:17:10.270 --> 00:17:10.280 align:start position:0%
thank you thank
 
00:17:13.870 --> 00:17:13.880 align:start position:0%
you so I guess um with that I was I was
 
00:17:19.029 --> 00:17:19.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:23.829 --> 00:17:23.839 align:start position:0%
um under the current bill when we were
 
00:17:26.829 --> 00:17:26.839 align:start position:0%
we were looking at um I guess it's under
 
00:17:29.669 --> 00:17:29.679 align:start position:0%
subsection seven where it talks about
 
00:17:31.270 --> 00:17:31.280 align:start position:0%
the program coordinating with an
 
00:17:34.630 --> 00:17:34.640 align:start position:0%
existing solid waste collection program
 
00:17:39.230 --> 00:17:39.240 align:start position:0%
to me this this could insinuate that we
 
00:17:42.110 --> 00:17:42.120 align:start position:0%
are also looking at um transportations
 
00:17:46.990 --> 00:17:47.000 align:start position:0%
other waste areas and I did look at um
 
00:17:49.029 --> 00:17:49.039 align:start position:0%
the paint CARE program they did mention
 
00:17:53.110 --> 00:17:53.120 align:start position:0%
in there that they do also work with
 
00:17:53.120 --> 00:17:56.029 align:start position:0%
in there that they do also work with
disposal

00:17:56.029 --> 00:17:56.039 align:start position:0%
disposal
 
00:17:59.830 --> 00:17:59.840 align:start position:0%
uh um political subdiv divisions to some
 
00:18:01.230 --> 00:18:01.240 align:start position:0%
entities so we would have to make a
 
00:18:04.630 --> 00:18:04.640 align:start position:0%
decision I think as a as a with regard
 
00:18:06.070 --> 00:18:06.080 align:start position:0%
to this bill whether or not we were
 
00:18:07.590 --> 00:18:07.600 align:start position:0%
interested in it applying only to
 
00:18:10.070 --> 00:18:10.080 align:start position:0%
wholesalers or if there were political
 
00:18:11.870 --> 00:18:11.880 align:start position:0%
subdivisions that would be involved in
 
00:18:18.909 --> 00:18:18.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:21.669 --> 00:18:21.679 align:start position:0%
will representative n NAB sorry thank
 
00:18:23.270 --> 00:18:23.280 align:start position:0%
you madam chair I just wouldn't want to
 
00:18:25.110 --> 00:18:25.120 align:start position:0%
exclude them you know I want would want
 
00:18:27.590 --> 00:18:27.600 align:start position:0%
it to be allowed it's not forcing them
 
00:18:29.590 --> 00:18:29.600 align:start position:0%
to do it but if it municipality decides
 
00:18:31.310 --> 00:18:31.320 align:start position:0%
that they want to do it then why should
 
00:18:33.390 --> 00:18:33.400 align:start position:0%
we stand in the way of
 
00:18:33.400 --> 00:18:37.789 align:start position:0%
we stand in the way of
that

00:18:37.789 --> 00:18:37.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:40.510 --> 00:18:40.520 align:start position:0%
yeah representative kulan yeah no I
 
00:18:42.710 --> 00:18:42.720 align:start position:0%
think it should be optional for the
 
00:18:44.830 --> 00:18:44.840 align:start position:0%
transfer stations if they want to do it
 
00:18:48.990 --> 00:18:49.000 align:start position:0%
I do I I will say too I like the
 
00:18:52.110 --> 00:18:52.120 align:start position:0%
manufacturer um route probably a little
 
00:18:55.789 --> 00:18:55.799 align:start position:0%
bit more but you know if the transfer
 
00:18:58.510 --> 00:18:58.520 align:start position:0%
stations are open to it like he had
 
00:19:01.270 --> 00:19:01.280 align:start position:0%
talked about I remember the how they
 
00:19:04.190 --> 00:19:04.200 align:start position:0%
sorted in like three different kind of
 
00:19:07.230 --> 00:19:07.240 align:start position:0%
holding tanks or whatever so like if
 
00:19:09.110 --> 00:19:09.120 align:start position:0%
they want to do something like that I
 
00:19:11.710 --> 00:19:11.720 align:start position:0%
don't see why we should stop them from
 
00:19:15.630 --> 00:19:15.640 align:start position:0%
doing that but I do like the uh
 
00:19:18.350 --> 00:19:18.360 align:start position:0%
manufacturer buyback thing it seems to
 
00:19:20.789 --> 00:19:20.799 align:start position:0%
be be more in line with just
 
00:19:20.799 --> 00:19:24.149 align:start position:0%
be be more in line with just
responsibility

00:19:24.149 --> 00:19:24.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:27.230 --> 00:19:27.240 align:start position:0%
so thank
 
00:19:31.230 --> 00:19:31.240 align:start position:0%
you representative Penta would you speak
 
00:19:35.110 --> 00:19:35.120 align:start position:0%
to um if you know if you can would you
 
00:19:40.070 --> 00:19:40.080 align:start position:0%
speak to the process of kind of in a in
 
00:19:43.950 --> 00:19:43.960 align:start position:0%
like a um a high-end overview of like
 
00:19:46.710 --> 00:19:46.720 align:start position:0%
what happens after the collection like
 
00:19:47.789 --> 00:19:47.799 align:start position:0%
with what they're do you know what I'm
 
00:19:49.070 --> 00:19:49.080 align:start position:0%
saying with what they're doing with the
 
00:19:52.510 --> 00:19:52.520 align:start position:0%
paint so so it's my understanding based
 
00:19:55.029 --> 00:19:55.039 align:start position:0%
on what I could see on the instructional
 
00:19:58.070 --> 00:19:58.080 align:start position:0%
videos through uh Pain Care even just
 
00:20:00.070 --> 00:20:00.080 align:start position:0%
just just at that is that the paints
 
00:20:02.110 --> 00:20:02.120 align:start position:0%
would come in and depending on how it is
 
00:20:04.149 --> 00:20:04.159 align:start position:0%
structured I think we heard about
 
00:20:06.430 --> 00:20:06.440 align:start position:0%
testimony in Arizona where there were
 
00:20:08.750 --> 00:20:08.760 align:start position:0%
three colors that were sort of collected
 
00:20:10.750 --> 00:20:10.760 align:start position:0%
Vermont seems to have more colors that
 
00:20:20.789 --> 00:20:20.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:20.799 --> 00:20:23.870 align:start position:0%
 
takebackspace

00:20:23.870 --> 00:20:23.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:27.070 --> 00:20:27.080 align:start position:0%
item recapturing of very like specific
 
00:20:30.029 --> 00:20:30.039 align:start position:0%
types um and it looked like those were
 
00:20:33.710 --> 00:20:33.720 align:start position:0%
then um collected mixed together and
 
00:20:33.720 --> 00:20:34.950 align:start position:0%
then um collected mixed together and
then

00:20:34.950 --> 00:20:34.960 align:start position:0%
then
 
00:20:37.390 --> 00:20:37.400 align:start position:0%
um re sort
 
00:20:41.070 --> 00:20:41.080 align:start position:0%
of clarified or repurposed then into new
 
00:20:44.710 --> 00:20:44.720 align:start position:0%
containers for discounted purchase I
 
00:20:47.750 --> 00:20:47.760 align:start position:0%
believe of those items then into the
 
00:20:47.760 --> 00:20:52.230 align:start position:0%
believe of those items then into the
public

00:20:52.230 --> 00:20:52.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:55.110 --> 00:20:55.120 align:start position:0%
again so pretty much the only the color
 
00:20:56.590 --> 00:20:56.600 align:start position:0%
that you get is pretty much
 
00:20:59.789 --> 00:20:59.799 align:start position:0%
Brown no no no I I think it to answer
 
00:21:01.029 --> 00:21:01.039 align:start position:0%
your question I think there were it
 
00:21:02.350 --> 00:21:02.360 align:start position:0%
could be a varying different thing I
 
00:21:04.270 --> 00:21:04.280 align:start position:0%
think we heard tan white and gray in
 
00:21:06.310 --> 00:21:06.320 align:start position:0%
Arizona and then in Vermont it was
 
00:21:08.990 --> 00:21:09.000 align:start position:0%
almost like for light colors um so they
 
00:21:11.789 --> 00:21:11.799 align:start position:0%
had oranges and reds and Browns and um
 
00:21:19.269 --> 00:21:19.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:21.909 --> 00:21:21.919 align:start position:0%
structured thank you Kristen she is um
 
00:21:23.909 --> 00:21:23.919 align:start position:0%
delivering all of the same things that I
 
00:21:25.149 --> 00:21:25.159 align:start position:0%
have so that you have those for
 
00:21:27.190 --> 00:21:27.200 align:start position:0%
consideration for today and perhaps even
 
00:21:41.630 --> 00:21:41.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:46.390 --> 00:21:46.400 align:start position:0%
so um in 1504 and sub
 
00:21:46.400 --> 00:21:48.909 align:start position:0%
so um in 1504 and sub
paragraph

00:21:48.909 --> 00:21:48.919 align:start position:0%
paragraph
 
00:21:52.950 --> 00:21:52.960 align:start position:0%
4 um we had sort of talked about the
 
00:21:55.549 --> 00:21:55.559 align:start position:0%
fact that all paint manufacturers it
 
00:21:57.470 --> 00:21:57.480 align:start position:0%
seems to me that this language states
 
00:22:00.070 --> 00:22:00.080 align:start position:0%
that all paint manufacturers must
 
00:22:02.590 --> 00:22:02.600 align:start position:0%
participate um
 
00:22:06.470 --> 00:22:06.480 align:start position:0%
and I'm curious to know whether or not I
 
00:22:07.750 --> 00:22:07.760 align:start position:0%
think that that is something that
 
00:22:09.669 --> 00:22:09.679 align:start position:0%
perhaps we have seen through paint care
 
00:22:11.789 --> 00:22:11.799 align:start position:0%
I do have some questions that I need to
 
00:22:14.710 --> 00:22:14.720 align:start position:0%
get some clarity from those entities on
 
00:22:16.190 --> 00:22:16.200 align:start position:0%
um but it seems like that's not an
 
00:22:19.390 --> 00:22:19.400 align:start position:0%
uncommon request um for the program if
 
00:22:21.230 --> 00:22:21.240 align:start position:0%
they are stood up in wholesaler or
 
00:22:23.470 --> 00:22:23.480 align:start position:0%
retail establishments that anybody who
 
00:22:25.830 --> 00:22:25.840 align:start position:0%
is selling within that retail
 
00:22:28.750 --> 00:22:28.760 align:start position:0%
establishment is part of that
 
00:22:28.760 --> 00:22:32.909 align:start position:0%
establishment is part of that
program

00:22:32.909 --> 00:22:32.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:35.990 --> 00:22:36.000 align:start position:0%
um and then I was curious to know
 
00:22:38.750 --> 00:22:38.760 align:start position:0%
whether or not we
 
00:22:38.760 --> 00:22:40.870 align:start position:0%
whether or not we
thought

00:22:40.870 --> 00:22:40.880 align:start position:0%
thought
 
00:22:44.430 --> 00:22:44.440 align:start position:0%
six there were varying dates of I think
 
00:22:46.990 --> 00:22:47.000 align:start position:0%
three months and six months mentioned in
 
00:22:52.390 --> 00:22:52.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:56.190 --> 00:22:56.200 align:start position:0%
um date and yeah and it looks like the
 
00:22:58.909 --> 00:22:58.919 align:start position:0%
it should take an effect uh 60 days two
 
00:23:01.310 --> 00:23:01.320 align:start position:0%
months after passage I'm wondering if we
 
00:23:03.669 --> 00:23:03.679 align:start position:0%
had any thoughts about whether or not
 
00:23:06.230 --> 00:23:06.240 align:start position:0%
something of this whether it's a pilot
 
00:23:09.510 --> 00:23:09.520 align:start position:0%
program or a Statewide enactment uh if
 
00:23:12.390 --> 00:23:12.400 align:start position:0%
60 days was sufficient to kind of get
 
00:23:14.990 --> 00:23:15.000 align:start position:0%
something out the door and rolling for
 
00:23:17.669 --> 00:23:17.679 align:start position:0%
the department and I guess I would defer
 
00:23:19.950 --> 00:23:19.960 align:start position:0%
to the department if you wouldn't mind
 
00:23:22.430 --> 00:23:22.440 align:start position:0%
uh speaking and uh sharing any thoughts
 
00:23:24.590 --> 00:23:24.600 align:start position:0%
or insights you might have with regard
 
00:23:27.430 --> 00:23:27.440 align:start position:0%
to the architectural paint and if for
 
00:23:29.029 --> 00:23:29.039 align:start position:0%
the record if you'll just introduce
 
00:23:29.039 --> 00:23:30.950 align:start position:0%
the record if you'll just introduce
yourselves

00:23:30.950 --> 00:23:30.960 align:start position:0%
yourselves
 
00:23:33.590 --> 00:23:33.600 align:start position:0%
again uh Todd pisit with New Hampshire
 
00:23:36.510 --> 00:23:36.520 align:start position:0%
Dees hazardous waste management Bureau
 
00:23:38.789 --> 00:23:38.799 align:start position:0%
and Michael Nor with the solid waste
 
00:23:40.390 --> 00:23:40.400 align:start position:0%
management Bureau of
 
00:23:45.310 --> 00:23:45.320 align:start position:0%
Dees um the bill does require a Dees or
 
00:23:47.950 --> 00:23:47.960 align:start position:0%
does require uh rules administrative
 
00:23:51.430 --> 00:23:51.440 align:start position:0%
rules to be written um we don't have the
 
00:23:54.190 --> 00:23:54.200 align:start position:0%
staff to to handle that right now so it
 
00:23:57.269 --> 00:23:57.279 align:start position:0%
would likely require require hiring a
 
00:24:00.710 --> 00:24:00.720 align:start position:0%
staff which isn't in the budget
 
00:24:03.390 --> 00:24:03.400 align:start position:0%
necessarily um but if we did hire staff
 
00:24:06.350 --> 00:24:06.360 align:start position:0%
that's a month two-month process and
 
00:24:07.990 --> 00:24:08.000 align:start position:0%
then that H that staff would have to get
 
00:24:11.230 --> 00:24:11.240 align:start position:0%
trained in writing rules and then the
 
00:24:13.029 --> 00:24:13.039 align:start position:0%
rule making process so I think six
 
00:24:16.149 --> 00:24:16.159 align:start position:0%
months is is very short for all of that
 
00:24:16.159 --> 00:24:17.909 align:start position:0%
months is is very short for all of that
to

00:24:17.909 --> 00:24:17.919 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:24:19.830 --> 00:24:19.840 align:start position:0%
happen I think under normal
 
00:24:22.190 --> 00:24:22.200 align:start position:0%
circumstances Ru making process probably
 
00:24:24.310 --> 00:24:24.320 align:start position:0%
takes anywhere from at least six months
 
00:24:26.029 --> 00:24:26.039 align:start position:0%
to maybe 12 months if you're if you're
 
00:24:28.310 --> 00:24:28.320 align:start position:0%
talking about establishing a whole new
 
00:24:31.149 --> 00:24:31.159 align:start position:0%
rule set more like 12 months
 
00:24:33.269 --> 00:24:33.279 align:start position:0%
probably and so that would be over and
 
00:24:35.590 --> 00:24:35.600 align:start position:0%
above the time required for establishing
 
00:24:37.630 --> 00:24:37.640 align:start position:0%
the position hiring the position
 
00:24:39.110 --> 00:24:39.120 align:start position:0%
training the person so you're talking
 
00:24:42.590 --> 00:24:42.600 align:start position:0%
about a year at least maybe a year and a
 
00:24:45.750 --> 00:24:45.760 align:start position:0%
half and may I first and then I'll I'll
 
00:24:47.230 --> 00:24:47.240 align:start position:0%
look to anybody else who has questions
 
00:24:51.630 --> 00:24:51.640 align:start position:0%
for the Department do you see there I
 
00:24:53.190 --> 00:24:53.200 align:start position:0%
mean would you agree I guess the
 
00:24:54.830 --> 00:24:54.840 align:start position:0%
question is that the way the current
 
00:24:56.710 --> 00:24:56.720 align:start position:0%
bill is structured it would enumerate
 
00:24:58.830 --> 00:24:58.840 align:start position:0%
new sections of the solid waste
 
00:25:02.110 --> 00:25:02.120 align:start position:0%
management uh
 
00:25:04.630 --> 00:25:04.640 align:start position:0%
statute uh yeah I believe I believe
 
00:25:07.950 --> 00:25:07.960 align:start position:0%
that's true it says at the uh very start
 
00:25:11.310 --> 00:25:11.320 align:start position:0%
of the Bill Amend RSA 149 M by inserting
 
00:25:13.110 --> 00:25:13.120 align:start position:0%
after section 63 the following new
 
00:25:15.789 --> 00:25:15.799 align:start position:0%
section or new subdivision so this is an
 
00:25:17.549 --> 00:25:17.559 align:start position:0%
amendment to the existing Solid Waste
 
00:25:19.510 --> 00:25:19.520 align:start position:0%
Management act and and and one more
 
00:25:21.549 --> 00:25:21.559 align:start position:0%
followup if I may I did have a question
 
00:25:23.549 --> 00:25:23.559 align:start position:0%
with regard to Extended producer
 
00:25:25.430 --> 00:25:25.440 align:start position:0%
responsibility as well because we
 
00:25:27.190 --> 00:25:27.200 align:start position:0%
already do have a section regarding
 
00:25:29.070 --> 00:25:29.080 align:start position:0%
extended producer
 
00:25:31.750 --> 00:25:31.760 align:start position:0%
responsibility um in
 
00:25:34.430 --> 00:25:34.440 align:start position:0%
statute um so I was wondering whether or
 
00:25:37.350 --> 00:25:37.360 align:start position:0%
not any of this could fall under that
 
00:25:40.389 --> 00:25:40.399 align:start position:0%
area or do you feel like it should in
 
00:25:42.510 --> 00:25:42.520 align:start position:0%
fact be enumerated as a separate entity
 
00:25:44.430 --> 00:25:44.440 align:start position:0%
alog together could you clarify which
 
00:25:46.510 --> 00:25:46.520 align:start position:0%
section of this because so I'm aware of
 
00:25:48.789 --> 00:25:48.799 align:start position:0%
a section about Mercury reduction and
 
00:25:50.750 --> 00:25:50.760 align:start position:0%
there's also a section about toxics and
 
00:25:52.950 --> 00:25:52.960 align:start position:0%
packaging but the only thing that's
 
00:25:55.669 --> 00:25:55.679 align:start position:0%
really epr I think is the Mercury
 
00:25:59.230 --> 00:25:59.240 align:start position:0%
reduction thank you for the
 
00:26:00.950 --> 00:26:00.960 align:start position:0%
thank you I appreciate that I was
 
00:26:03.990 --> 00:26:04.000 align:start position:0%
actually looking at I thought it was 149
 
00:26:08.110 --> 00:26:08.120 align:start position:0%
M col 62 but I could be
 
00:26:08.120 --> 00:26:10.269 align:start position:0%
M col 62 but I could be
wrong

00:26:10.269 --> 00:26:10.279 align:start position:0%
wrong
 
00:26:13.149 --> 00:26:13.159 align:start position:0%
um that might be the solid waste working
 
00:26:15.110 --> 00:26:15.120 align:start position:0%
group I don't I don't have it memorized
 
00:26:17.990 --> 00:26:18.000 align:start position:0%
off the top of my head it it was under
 
00:26:21.830 --> 00:26:21.840 align:start position:0%
so I I'm looking here sort of it's It's
 
00:26:24.149 --> 00:26:24.159 align:start position:0%
conversations about Advanced Recycling
 
00:26:26.669 --> 00:26:26.679 align:start position:0%
and what that is or isn't and so I was
 
00:26:29.070 --> 00:26:29.080 align:start position:0%
curious to know whether whether or
 
00:26:33.029 --> 00:26:33.039 align:start position:0%
not something like this would fall under
 
00:26:35.990 --> 00:26:36.000 align:start position:0%
that or would you it seems to me that
 
00:26:37.830 --> 00:26:37.840 align:start position:0%
you would think a whole separate statute
 
00:26:37.840 --> 00:26:38.870 align:start position:0%
you would think a whole separate statute
is

00:26:38.870 --> 00:26:38.880 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:26:41.310 --> 00:26:41.320 align:start position:0%
required I believe so there's nothing in
 
00:26:43.789 --> 00:26:43.799 align:start position:0%
the in the statute currently that really
 
00:26:47.549 --> 00:26:47.559 align:start position:0%
fits this kind of structure great so I
 
00:26:49.230 --> 00:26:49.240 align:start position:0%
believe it would probably be its own
 
00:26:49.240 --> 00:26:50.190 align:start position:0%
believe it would probably be its own
kind

00:26:50.190 --> 00:26:50.200 align:start position:0%
kind
 
00:26:52.669 --> 00:26:52.679 align:start position:0%
of it it would need its own language
 
00:26:54.750 --> 00:26:54.760 align:start position:0%
okay yeah thank you and representative
 
00:26:57.870 --> 00:26:57.880 align:start position:0%
ger and then representative nav thank
 
00:26:59.750 --> 00:26:59.760 align:start position:0%
you madam chair and so wondering if you
 
00:27:02.310 --> 00:27:02.320 align:start position:0%
know the bill is is currently written I
 
00:27:07.350 --> 00:27:07.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:07.360 --> 00:27:09.149 align:start position:0%
 
requires

00:27:09.149 --> 00:27:09.159 align:start position:0%
requires
 
00:27:12.430 --> 00:27:12.440 align:start position:0%
uh the department shall set goals this
 
00:27:16.110 --> 00:27:16.120 align:start position:0%
is in section 5e the department shall
 
00:27:17.549 --> 00:27:17.559 align:start position:0%
set goals for the collection of
 
00:27:19.310 --> 00:27:19.320 align:start position:0%
architectural paint within four months
 
00:27:21.590 --> 00:27:21.600 align:start position:0%
of the date of the first annual report
 
00:27:23.990 --> 00:27:24.000 align:start position:0%
of the manufacturers program but if we
 
00:27:26.110 --> 00:27:26.120 align:start position:0%
were looking at a program that started
 
00:27:28.590 --> 00:27:28.600 align:start position:0%
as a pilot program where we had
 
00:27:31.029 --> 00:27:31.039 align:start position:0%
retailers themselves uh who would
 
00:27:34.470 --> 00:27:34.480 align:start position:0%
collect this paint uh and then provide
 
00:27:39.110 --> 00:27:39.120 align:start position:0%
reports to to Dees on kind of six or 12
 
00:27:41.110 --> 00:27:41.120 align:start position:0%
month basis in terms of how much they
 
00:27:43.350 --> 00:27:43.360 align:start position:0%
have taken back in right as part of a
 
00:27:47.149 --> 00:27:47.159 align:start position:0%
pilot program uh is that something that
 
00:27:50.070 --> 00:27:50.080 align:start position:0%
that Dees could do if if this again was
 
00:27:53.830 --> 00:27:53.840 align:start position:0%
a uh retailer based program and all
 
00:27:57.509 --> 00:27:57.519 align:start position:0%
we're asking Dees to do is to receive
 
00:28:00.389 --> 00:28:00.399 align:start position:0%
semiannual or annual reports on the
 
00:28:04.669 --> 00:28:04.679 align:start position:0%
amount of paint that is being uh
 
00:28:07.230 --> 00:28:07.240 align:start position:0%
returned I I think if if you're asking
 
00:28:09.950 --> 00:28:09.960 align:start position:0%
Dees to review a couple of semiannual
 
00:28:12.549 --> 00:28:12.559 align:start position:0%
reports or something like that that's
 
00:28:16.149 --> 00:28:16.159 align:start position:0%
seems feasible but the question I I
 
00:28:18.190 --> 00:28:18.200 align:start position:0%
guess for a pilot test would it require
 
00:28:20.110 --> 00:28:20.120 align:start position:0%
administrative rules would it require
 
00:28:23.149 --> 00:28:23.159 align:start position:0%
any any other type of oversight by Dees
 
00:28:24.669 --> 00:28:24.679 align:start position:0%
because then you're talking about a
 
00:28:27.710 --> 00:28:27.720 align:start position:0%
position that may or may not last the
 
00:28:30.789 --> 00:28:30.799 align:start position:0%
pilot test doesn't seem to work out and
 
00:28:32.990 --> 00:28:33.000 align:start position:0%
they they cancel it then you've hired
 
00:28:36.950 --> 00:28:36.960 align:start position:0%
somebody for a year two years and then
 
00:28:38.789 --> 00:28:38.799 align:start position:0%
and then eliminate that
 
00:28:41.669 --> 00:28:41.679 align:start position:0%
position potentially can I can I just
 
00:28:43.430 --> 00:28:43.440 align:start position:0%
add I think the other thing to consider
 
00:28:44.389 --> 00:28:44.399 align:start position:0%
here is that we're talking about
 
00:28:46.909 --> 00:28:46.919 align:start position:0%
collection of paint which includes latex
 
00:28:48.950 --> 00:28:48.960 align:start position:0%
paint which currently is not regulated
 
00:28:51.669 --> 00:28:51.679 align:start position:0%
as a hazardous waste but oilbased paint
 
00:28:54.549 --> 00:28:54.559 align:start position:0%
and stains and varnishes typically are a
 
00:28:56.430 --> 00:28:56.440 align:start position:0%
hazardous waste so if you're talking
 
00:28:59.389 --> 00:28:59.399 align:start position:0%
about a retailer collecting those items
 
00:29:01.590 --> 00:29:01.600 align:start position:0%
they may trigger and Todd can speak a
 
00:29:02.549 --> 00:29:02.559 align:start position:0%
little bit more about this they may
 
00:29:04.830 --> 00:29:04.840 align:start position:0%
trigger certain regulatory requirements
 
00:29:07.630 --> 00:29:07.640 align:start position:0%
um yeah so most of the Home Depot and
 
00:29:09.549 --> 00:29:09.559 align:start position:0%
lows in the state are already notified
 
00:29:11.950 --> 00:29:11.960 align:start position:0%
as hazardous waste generators but places
 
00:29:14.149 --> 00:29:14.159 align:start position:0%
like Ace and Benjamin Moore and Sherwin
 
00:29:16.549 --> 00:29:16.559 align:start position:0%
Williams are not so if they started
 
00:29:19.110 --> 00:29:19.120 align:start position:0%
taking in oilbased paints and stains and
 
00:29:21.430 --> 00:29:21.440 align:start position:0%
varnishes they may have to become a
 
00:29:24.549 --> 00:29:24.559 align:start position:0%
hazardous waste generator so back to
 
00:29:26.590 --> 00:29:26.600 align:start position:0%
representative penza's question about
 
00:29:29.029 --> 00:29:29.039 align:start position:0%
whether the retail ERS are are on board
 
00:29:31.470 --> 00:29:31.480 align:start position:0%
I don't know I don't but that's
 
00:29:33.750 --> 00:29:33.760 align:start position:0%
something that they would need to
 
00:29:35.590 --> 00:29:35.600 align:start position:0%
consider thank
 
00:29:38.590 --> 00:29:38.600 align:start position:0%
you representative n thank you madam
 
00:29:40.470 --> 00:29:40.480 align:start position:0%
chair um is it possible that that
 
00:29:41.950 --> 00:29:41.960 align:start position:0%
position could be a contract position I
 
00:29:44.470 --> 00:29:44.480 align:start position:0%
mean it seems to hire someone to set
 
00:29:47.310 --> 00:29:47.320 align:start position:0%
rules is not an indefinite
 
00:29:49.710 --> 00:29:49.720 align:start position:0%
need unless they can be transferred to
 
00:29:53.789 --> 00:29:53.799 align:start position:0%
other I was talking to um director whims
 
00:29:56.430 --> 00:29:56.440 align:start position:0%
about this on Friday and his thought is
 
00:29:58.350 --> 00:29:58.360 align:start position:0%
that when Bill bills like this come up
 
00:30:00.870 --> 00:30:00.880 align:start position:0%
it's generally if there's a new position
 
00:30:03.070 --> 00:30:03.080 align:start position:0%
it's generally uh funded from the
 
00:30:06.470 --> 00:30:06.480 align:start position:0%
general fund um because there's a lot of
 
00:30:08.350 --> 00:30:08.360 align:start position:0%
effort up front and the fees is not
 
00:30:10.549 --> 00:30:10.559 align:start position:0%
going to have been collected yet but
 
00:30:13.389 --> 00:30:13.399 align:start position:0%
then maybe there's a transfer to that
 
00:30:16.789 --> 00:30:16.799 align:start position:0%
fee being part of or part of that fee
 
00:30:19.389 --> 00:30:19.399 align:start position:0%
being paying that that position and
 
00:30:22.149 --> 00:30:22.159 align:start position:0%
maybe after two years that can become a
 
00:30:25.070 --> 00:30:25.080 align:start position:0%
a part-time position maybe work on other
 
00:30:26.669 --> 00:30:26.679 align:start position:0%
things as well keep it a full-time
 
00:30:27.750 --> 00:30:27.760 align:start position:0%
position that
 
00:30:29.909 --> 00:30:29.919 align:start position:0%
is half paint care and half some
 
00:30:33.470 --> 00:30:33.480 align:start position:0%
something else related um but we didn't
 
00:30:34.870 --> 00:30:34.880 align:start position:0%
really talk about whether or not it
 
00:30:37.310 --> 00:30:37.320 align:start position:0%
would be could be a contracted position
 
00:30:39.549 --> 00:30:39.559 align:start position:0%
I don't know that Dees has a lot of
 
00:30:43.350 --> 00:30:43.360 align:start position:0%
those not in Waste Management
 
00:30:46.870 --> 00:30:46.880 align:start position:0%
anyway thank you uh representative
 
00:30:50.029 --> 00:30:50.039 align:start position:0%
Penza since we have neighboring states
 
00:30:52.269 --> 00:30:52.279 align:start position:0%
that are that that have are already
 
00:30:54.149 --> 00:30:54.159 align:start position:0%
participating in this so for example
 
00:30:58.430 --> 00:30:58.440 align:start position:0%
let's use Maine and uh they have 129
 
00:31:01.430 --> 00:31:01.440 align:start position:0%
sites they've collected 1.1 million
 
00:31:03.669 --> 00:31:03.679 align:start position:0%
gallons and so I guess they started this
 
00:31:06.269 --> 00:31:06.279 align:start position:0%
in in looks like
 
00:31:08.950 --> 00:31:08.960 align:start position:0%
2015 wouldn't it make the most sense to
 
00:31:12.669 --> 00:31:12.679 align:start position:0%
talk to a neighbor and see how it how it
 
00:31:14.629 --> 00:31:14.639 align:start position:0%
all started how it was implemented I
 
00:31:16.230 --> 00:31:16.240 align:start position:0%
know I don't want to have to hire
 
00:31:18.190 --> 00:31:18.200 align:start position:0%
another staff to implement this I think
 
00:31:21.269 --> 00:31:21.279 align:start position:0%
that we have lots of sections in Statute
 
00:31:23.269 --> 00:31:23.279 align:start position:0%
in reduction in recycling and all of
 
00:31:25.750 --> 00:31:25.760 align:start position:0%
that um but for the people that have
 
00:31:27.310 --> 00:31:27.320 align:start position:0%
been doing this the states that have
 
00:31:29.710 --> 00:31:29.720 align:start position:0%
been doing this um wouldn't it make
 
00:31:32.470 --> 00:31:32.480 align:start position:0%
sense to see how it's been operating and
 
00:31:34.509 --> 00:31:34.519 align:start position:0%
how we could implement it without
 
00:31:38.629 --> 00:31:38.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:41.070 --> 00:31:41.080 align:start position:0%
department I yeah I can talk I could
 
00:31:43.549 --> 00:31:43.559 align:start position:0%
talk to um I have a relationships with
 
00:31:45.870 --> 00:31:45.880 align:start position:0%
the Hazardous Waste departments uh
 
00:31:48.470 --> 00:31:48.480 align:start position:0%
divisions in Maine and Vermont who both
 
00:31:50.629 --> 00:31:50.639 align:start position:0%
have paint care I could talk to them I
 
00:31:53.269 --> 00:31:53.279 align:start position:0%
don't know if they are doing it without
 
00:31:55.110 --> 00:31:55.120 align:start position:0%
any additional burden on the department
 
00:31:58.110 --> 00:31:58.120 align:start position:0%
but it's it's a conversation we could
 
00:32:00.430 --> 00:32:00.440 align:start position:0%
have thank you representative Penza
 
00:32:02.789 --> 00:32:02.799 align:start position:0%
additionally yes um the state of Vermont
 
00:32:05.110 --> 00:32:05.120 align:start position:0%
also only they have a much smaller sort
 
00:32:09.830 --> 00:32:09.840 align:start position:0%
of site pool of 81 participants that was
 
00:32:12.549 --> 00:32:12.559 align:start position:0%
established in 2014 and they similarly
 
00:32:16.710 --> 00:32:16.720 align:start position:0%
were able to um keep out uh 1.1 million
 
00:32:21.470 --> 00:32:21.480 align:start position:0%
gallons of paint um out of uh you know
 
00:32:24.070 --> 00:32:24.080 align:start position:0%
the sort of waste stream if you will um
 
00:32:26.149 --> 00:32:26.159 align:start position:0%
so I do think that uh perhaps if the
 
00:32:29.789 --> 00:32:29.799 align:start position:0%
department an appetite for contacting uh
 
00:32:32.029 --> 00:32:32.039 align:start position:0%
those neighboring states and and I too
 
00:32:33.830 --> 00:32:33.840 align:start position:0%
can certainly reach out and and hear
 
00:32:35.870 --> 00:32:35.880 align:start position:0%
some input on how those were structured
 
00:32:37.629 --> 00:32:37.639 align:start position:0%
I also have statute that I can go back
 
00:32:40.950 --> 00:32:40.960 align:start position:0%
and take a look at um I think that that
 
00:32:44.149 --> 00:32:44.159 align:start position:0%
would be useful to our discussion
 
00:32:48.509 --> 00:32:48.519 align:start position:0%
okay and I'll just add to
 
00:32:48.519 --> 00:32:51.549 align:start position:0%
okay and I'll just add to
um

00:32:51.549 --> 00:32:51.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:54.789 --> 00:32:54.799 align:start position:0%
um the uh about the the the the number
 
00:32:56.870 --> 00:32:56.880 align:start position:0%
of gallons of paint that have been taken
 
00:32:59.350 --> 00:32:59.360 align:start position:0%
I I I would imagine I don't know I
 
00:33:01.070 --> 00:33:01.080 align:start position:0%
haven't talked to any municipalities but
 
00:33:03.669 --> 00:33:03.679 align:start position:0%
I would imagine that municipalities and
 
00:33:05.830 --> 00:33:05.840 align:start position:0%
and County Planning commissions would
 
00:33:09.110 --> 00:33:09.120 align:start position:0%
would support such a bill because they
 
00:33:10.990 --> 00:33:11.000 align:start position:0%
Whenever there are household hazardous
 
00:33:13.470 --> 00:33:13.480 align:start position:0%
waste collection events everyone I've
 
00:33:15.710 --> 00:33:15.720 align:start position:0%
talked to says that the number one thing
 
00:33:20.070 --> 00:33:20.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:22.269 --> 00:33:22.279 align:start position:0%
pain representative brewyard and then
 
00:33:22.279 --> 00:33:23.549 align:start position:0%
pain representative brewyard and then
representative

00:33:23.549 --> 00:33:23.559 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:33:26.190 --> 00:33:26.200 align:start position:0%
Penza a couple of things uh I just
 
00:33:28.230 --> 00:33:28.240 align:start position:0%
wanted to
 
00:33:31.470 --> 00:33:31.480 align:start position:0%
also um make sure manufacturers are on
 
00:33:33.110 --> 00:33:33.120 align:start position:0%
board with potentially becoming
 
00:33:35.710 --> 00:33:35.720 align:start position:0%
hazardous waste generators whether it's
 
00:33:39.629 --> 00:33:39.639 align:start position:0%
uh you know vsqg sqg squeegee full
 
00:33:42.830 --> 00:33:42.840 align:start position:0%
quantity generator and and everything
 
00:33:45.350 --> 00:33:45.360 align:start position:0%
that comes with it the permitting the
 
00:33:48.269 --> 00:33:48.279 align:start position:0%
reporting you're now subject to
 
00:33:51.669 --> 00:33:51.679 align:start position:0%
inspections uh I think that's key in
 
00:33:53.470 --> 00:33:53.480 align:start position:0%
making sure manufacturers are going to
 
00:33:57.029 --> 00:33:57.039 align:start position:0%
be on board with that uh Second thing
 
00:33:58.789 --> 00:33:58.799 align:start position:0%
can we just get into the household
 
00:34:01.789 --> 00:34:01.799 align:start position:0%
hazardous waste um days where typically
 
00:34:03.750 --> 00:34:03.760 align:start position:0%
it's it's available throughout the
 
00:34:08.430 --> 00:34:08.440 align:start position:0%
state um now is it all paint that
 
00:34:10.310 --> 00:34:10.320 align:start position:0%
they're taking is are they not allowing
 
00:34:13.510 --> 00:34:13.520 align:start position:0%
a latex or acrylic as far as I know at
 
00:34:16.550 --> 00:34:16.560 align:start position:0%
least at least um the ones I've talked
 
00:34:18.389 --> 00:34:18.399 align:start position:0%
to they don't take latex because latex
 
00:34:21.669 --> 00:34:21.679 align:start position:0%
is not a hazardous waste so that's when
 
00:34:24.190 --> 00:34:24.200 align:start position:0%
if if somebody brings latex paint to a
 
00:34:26.069 --> 00:34:26.079 align:start position:0%
household hazardous waste event they'll
 
00:34:28.589 --> 00:34:28.599 align:start position:0%
tell them put kitty litter in it or sand
 
00:34:30.750 --> 00:34:30.760 align:start position:0%
or whatever dry it out and throw it away
 
00:34:32.869 --> 00:34:32.879 align:start position:0%
they're they're only taking oilbased and
 
00:34:35.470 --> 00:34:35.480 align:start position:0%
and stains and and that that sort of
 
00:34:38.669 --> 00:34:38.679 align:start position:0%
thing okay thank
 
00:34:42.750 --> 00:34:42.760 align:start position:0%
you representative Penza so when when I
 
00:34:45.829 --> 00:34:45.839 align:start position:0%
lived in a a smaller town versus I'm in
 
00:34:48.550 --> 00:34:48.560 align:start position:0%
Rochester in a city um I just have to
 
00:34:52.310 --> 00:34:52.320 align:start position:0%
say that they were not enough those
 
00:34:54.389 --> 00:34:54.399 align:start position:0%
those hazardous waste days sometimes
 
00:34:56.950 --> 00:34:56.960 align:start position:0%
they're once a year and some of these
 
00:34:59.790 --> 00:34:59.800 align:start position:0%
people are keeping you know these cans
 
00:35:01.829 --> 00:35:01.839 align:start position:0%
in their you know in their garages in
 
00:35:04.030 --> 00:35:04.040 align:start position:0%
their basements for a really long time
 
00:35:07.589 --> 00:35:07.599 align:start position:0%
so um I I think there's an appetite for
 
00:35:11.069 --> 00:35:11.079 align:start position:0%
it uh I just I hope that the process is
 
00:35:12.910 --> 00:35:12.920 align:start position:0%
working and effective that we could
 
00:35:14.950 --> 00:35:14.960 align:start position:0%
Implement something here in New
 
00:35:18.550 --> 00:35:18.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire without you know taxing
 
00:35:20.710 --> 00:35:20.720 align:start position:0%
resources um
 
00:35:20.720 --> 00:35:23.150 align:start position:0%
resources um
but

00:35:23.150 --> 00:35:23.160 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:35:26.109 --> 00:35:26.119 align:start position:0%
if let's say for example you had said
 
00:35:27.829 --> 00:35:27.839 align:start position:0%
that Home Depot those types of places
 
00:35:30.510 --> 00:35:30.520 align:start position:0%
already you know the bigger box stores
 
00:35:32.190 --> 00:35:32.200 align:start position:0%
yes correct so we don't have to worry
 
00:35:34.190 --> 00:35:34.200 align:start position:0%
about those so if it's a smaller one
 
00:35:35.910 --> 00:35:35.920 align:start position:0%
like a Benjamin Mo or something like
 
00:35:39.390 --> 00:35:39.400 align:start position:0%
that um an Ace Hardware you mentioned
 
00:35:43.750 --> 00:35:43.760 align:start position:0%
that sells paint could they be a
 
00:35:46.310 --> 00:35:46.320 align:start position:0%
um they wouldn't necessarily they could
 
00:35:49.109 --> 00:35:49.119 align:start position:0%
participate in the program but they
 
00:35:51.710 --> 00:35:51.720 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have to necessarily be a place
 
00:35:54.990 --> 00:35:55.000 align:start position:0%
that is um a drop off location either so
 
00:35:56.870 --> 00:35:56.880 align:start position:0%
we wouldn't have to worry about what
 
00:35:59.270 --> 00:35:59.280 align:start position:0%
representative um brard is talking about
 
00:36:01.750 --> 00:36:01.760 align:start position:0%
in a sense with permitting and all those
 
00:36:02.990 --> 00:36:03.000 align:start position:0%
types of things that they would have to
 
00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:04.550 align:start position:0%
types of things that they would have to
be

00:36:04.550 --> 00:36:04.560 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:36:07.470 --> 00:36:07.480 align:start position:0%
correct I'm not sure what participate
 
00:36:09.630 --> 00:36:09.640 align:start position:0%
means if particip to me I thought
 
00:36:11.710 --> 00:36:11.720 align:start position:0%
participate meant you if you sell paint
 
00:36:13.950 --> 00:36:13.960 align:start position:0%
you have to be a drop off location maybe
 
00:36:17.069 --> 00:36:17.079 align:start position:0%
that's not the way it's actually I don't
 
00:36:19.430 --> 00:36:19.440 align:start position:0%
believe that's the case so you can you
 
00:36:22.430 --> 00:36:22.440 align:start position:0%
can sell the paint and it has like the
 
00:36:24.190 --> 00:36:24.200 align:start position:0%
expanded fee on it but it's not
 
00:36:26.230 --> 00:36:26.240 align:start position:0%
necessarily that you're taking it in
 
00:36:28.270 --> 00:36:28.280 align:start position:0%
okay so participate could just mean
 
00:36:30.950 --> 00:36:30.960 align:start position:0%
collect the fee correct okay that then
 
00:36:33.190 --> 00:36:33.200 align:start position:0%
goes to the entity that's working on
 
00:36:35.349 --> 00:36:35.359 align:start position:0%
where people can bring their um bring
 
00:36:41.230 --> 00:36:41.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:44.670 --> 00:36:44.680 align:start position:0%
so so I did have a question about um I
 
00:36:46.230 --> 00:36:46.240 align:start position:0%
know that we have looked at other fee
 
00:36:48.510 --> 00:36:48.520 align:start position:0%
structures and other programs obviously
 
00:36:51.829 --> 00:36:51.839 align:start position:0%
the Mercury um and then we're we're also
 
00:36:54.190 --> 00:36:54.200 align:start position:0%
looking at I like broader batteries
 
00:36:58.870 --> 00:36:58.880 align:start position:0%
perhaps um and we know that those uh
 
00:37:00.589 --> 00:37:00.599 align:start position:0%
programs are already out there like our
 
00:37:02.430 --> 00:37:02.440 align:start position:0%
best buys again bigger box stores are
 
00:37:04.030 --> 00:37:04.040 align:start position:0%
already taking some of those things back
 
00:37:05.910 --> 00:37:05.920 align:start position:0%
we're looking to perhaps expand some of
 
00:37:08.430 --> 00:37:08.440 align:start position:0%
that within the legislature this year um
 
00:37:10.150 --> 00:37:10.160 align:start position:0%
but let's just focus on the the
 
00:37:11.670 --> 00:37:11.680 align:start position:0%
traditional batteries that are already
 
00:37:14.390 --> 00:37:14.400 align:start position:0%
being reclaimed um those seem to be
 
00:37:17.950 --> 00:37:17.960 align:start position:0%
functioning without a whole lot of
 
00:37:19.790 --> 00:37:19.800 align:start position:0%
oversight through the Departments would
 
00:37:22.829 --> 00:37:22.839 align:start position:0%
I am I correct currently in that line of
 
00:37:24.550 --> 00:37:24.560 align:start position:0%
thought or
 
00:37:28.470 --> 00:37:28.480 align:start position:0%
thinking do have any knowledge on that I
 
00:37:30.150 --> 00:37:30.160 align:start position:0%
guess well the the items that we're
 
00:37:31.470 --> 00:37:31.480 align:start position:0%
talking about that are currently be
 
00:37:32.710 --> 00:37:32.720 align:start position:0%
being collected at like a Home Depot
 
00:37:34.390 --> 00:37:34.400 align:start position:0%
where they're taking in like Mercury
 
00:37:36.910 --> 00:37:36.920 align:start position:0%
bulbs like those things are Universal
 
00:37:38.710 --> 00:37:38.720 align:start position:0%
waste so they have a different set of
 
00:37:41.150 --> 00:37:41.160 align:start position:0%
rules and again Todd can they're they're
 
00:37:43.630 --> 00:37:43.640 align:start position:0%
under the Hazardous Waste rules but the
 
00:37:46.430 --> 00:37:46.440 align:start position:0%
um hazardous waste rules are uh
 
00:37:48.069 --> 00:37:48.079 align:start position:0%
administrative rules
 
00:37:50.030 --> 00:37:50.040 align:start position:0%
enbw 100 through
 
00:37:56.270 --> 00:37:56.280 align:start position:0%
1300 chapter 1100 is universal waste so
 
00:37:59.270 --> 00:37:59.280 align:start position:0%
that's those things like batteries
 
00:38:04.109 --> 00:38:04.119 align:start position:0%
antifreeze aerosol cans uh light bulbs
 
00:38:07.190 --> 00:38:07.200 align:start position:0%
fluoresent bulbs those are all sort of
 
00:38:10.270 --> 00:38:10.280 align:start position:0%
they're still regulated under the hazard
 
00:38:12.670 --> 00:38:12.680 align:start position:0%
hazardous waste rules but they're exempt
 
00:38:14.349 --> 00:38:14.359 align:start position:0%
from the generator a lot of the
 
00:38:17.510 --> 00:38:17.520 align:start position:0%
generator requirements and um other
 
00:38:19.710 --> 00:38:19.720 align:start position:0%
requirements in the rules so they they
 
00:38:24.790 --> 00:38:24.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:26.829 --> 00:38:26.839 align:start position:0%
differently I know you had your hand and
 
00:38:28.910 --> 00:38:28.920 align:start position:0%
then I'll go uh representative NAB and
 
00:38:30.589 --> 00:38:30.599 align:start position:0%
was it representative pulon did you have
 
00:38:32.670 --> 00:38:32.680 align:start position:0%
your hand up oh yeah okay so that's sort
 
00:38:34.990 --> 00:38:35.000 align:start position:0%
of the order the way this bill is
 
00:38:37.349 --> 00:38:37.359 align:start position:0%
written it sounds like the manufacturer
 
00:38:40.390 --> 00:38:40.400 align:start position:0%
is taking ownership for the program so
 
00:38:42.910 --> 00:38:42.920 align:start position:0%
even if you have a third party that the
 
00:38:45.390 --> 00:38:45.400 align:start position:0%
manufacturer you know employs to have
 
00:38:47.710 --> 00:38:47.720 align:start position:0%
collection they're still taking
 
00:38:50.230 --> 00:38:50.240 align:start position:0%
ownership of it so they're the ones that
 
00:38:52.150 --> 00:38:52.160 align:start position:0%
would be liable they're the ones that
 
00:38:53.750 --> 00:38:53.760 align:start position:0%
would still have
 
00:38:58.230 --> 00:38:58.240 align:start position:0%
to again assume be uh classified as the
 
00:39:01.230 --> 00:39:01.240 align:start position:0%
generator um I mean this also gets in
 
00:39:04.390 --> 00:39:04.400 align:start position:0%
line with uh training your employees to
 
00:39:07.950 --> 00:39:07.960 align:start position:0%
handle hazardous waste uh it gets into a
 
00:39:11.710 --> 00:39:11.720 align:start position:0%
whole uh you know plethora of other
 
00:39:16.150 --> 00:39:16.160 align:start position:0%
requirements is set forth in uh the
 
00:39:16.160 --> 00:39:17.790 align:start position:0%
requirements is set forth in uh the
403

00:39:17.790 --> 00:39:17.800 align:start position:0%
403
 
00:39:22.550 --> 00:39:22.560 align:start position:0%
um DS DS rules right generator rules
 
00:39:26.670 --> 00:39:26.680 align:start position:0%
yeah uh generator rules are under 500 he
 
00:39:31.309 --> 00:39:31.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:35.430 --> 00:39:35.440 align:start position:0%
you NAB and then kulan and then
 
00:39:37.910 --> 00:39:37.920 align:start position:0%
J um thank you madam chair I just wanted
 
00:39:39.470 --> 00:39:39.480 align:start position:0%
to say big picture you know I do think
 
00:39:40.829 --> 00:39:40.839 align:start position:0%
it's important to have manufacturer
 
00:39:43.349 --> 00:39:43.359 align:start position:0%
support and buy in in this um but this
 
00:39:46.510 --> 00:39:46.520 align:start position:0%
is also a huge service to our residents
 
00:39:48.390 --> 00:39:48.400 align:start position:0%
and our municipalities you know it's a
 
00:39:50.870 --> 00:39:50.880 align:start position:0%
big diversion of a very heavy weight
 
00:39:52.589 --> 00:39:52.599 align:start position:0%
from the waist stream um and to
 
00:39:54.550 --> 00:39:54.560 align:start position:0%
representative Po's point I think we all
 
00:39:56.230 --> 00:39:56.240 align:start position:0%
have cans of paint in our basements that
 
00:39:58.230 --> 00:39:58.240 align:start position:0%
we we don't know what to do with I know
 
00:39:59.670 --> 00:39:59.680 align:start position:0%
my husband spends a lot of time asking
 
00:40:02.550 --> 00:40:02.560 align:start position:0%
me when hazardous waste day is so um you
 
00:40:03.990 --> 00:40:04.000 align:start position:0%
know I think it's a huge benefit so I
 
00:40:05.790 --> 00:40:05.800 align:start position:0%
think it is important to have that buy
 
00:40:07.550 --> 00:40:07.560 align:start position:0%
in but it's also important to recognize
 
00:40:09.190 --> 00:40:09.200 align:start position:0%
that there are several stakeholders here
 
00:40:11.230 --> 00:40:11.240 align:start position:0%
and it's not just the manufacturers
 
00:40:11.240 --> 00:40:12.470 align:start position:0%
and it's not just the manufacturers
thank

00:40:12.470 --> 00:40:12.480 align:start position:0%
thank
 
00:40:14.550 --> 00:40:14.560 align:start position:0%
you you and then I think we went
 
00:40:16.150 --> 00:40:16.160 align:start position:0%
representative kulan and then
 
00:40:16.160 --> 00:40:17.630 align:start position:0%
representative kulan and then
representative

00:40:17.630 --> 00:40:17.640 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:40:20.390 --> 00:40:20.400 align:start position:0%
gerna yeah I think
 
00:40:23.510 --> 00:40:23.520 align:start position:0%
I the the pilot program I did kind of
 
00:40:25.390 --> 00:40:25.400 align:start position:0%
just stuck in my mind when I heard about
 
00:40:26.910 --> 00:40:26.920 align:start position:0%
this and the more
 
00:40:29.470 --> 00:40:29.480 align:start position:0%
kind of details I'm hearing now that
 
00:40:32.550 --> 00:40:32.560 align:start position:0%
need to be sused out I think that the
 
00:40:35.030 --> 00:40:35.040 align:start position:0%
pilot program thing still sounds like a
 
00:40:37.470 --> 00:40:37.480 align:start position:0%
good idea to me just to see if how it
 
00:40:40.390 --> 00:40:40.400 align:start position:0%
would work out potentially you know we
 
00:40:42.790 --> 00:40:42.800 align:start position:0%
can figure out who wants to be involved
 
00:40:44.309 --> 00:40:44.319 align:start position:0%
where the sites are going to be and
 
00:40:46.630 --> 00:40:46.640 align:start position:0%
things like that I think it's a good
 
00:40:49.910 --> 00:40:49.920 align:start position:0%
idea to have at least a couple places in
 
00:40:53.069 --> 00:40:53.079 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire where this paint can be uh
 
00:40:53.079 --> 00:40:55.309 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire where this paint can be uh
collected

00:40:55.309 --> 00:40:55.319 align:start position:0%
collected
 
00:40:55.319 --> 00:40:57.829 align:start position:0%
collected
so

00:40:57.829 --> 00:40:57.839 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:41:00.790 --> 00:41:00.800 align:start position:0%
ger thank you madam chair I think that
 
00:41:02.390 --> 00:41:02.400 align:start position:0%
we're going down we're going too far
 
00:41:04.829 --> 00:41:04.839 align:start position:0%
down a road that's not productive uh we
 
00:41:06.910 --> 00:41:06.920 align:start position:0%
don't need to reinvent the wheel uh this
 
00:41:09.750 --> 00:41:09.760 align:start position:0%
exists it exists very successfully in a
 
00:41:12.069 --> 00:41:12.079 align:start position:0%
number of other states uh and and I
 
00:41:14.270 --> 00:41:14.280 align:start position:0%
appreciate uh our friends from Dees
 
00:41:16.430 --> 00:41:16.440 align:start position:0%
coming in to to answer our questions
 
00:41:18.150 --> 00:41:18.160 align:start position:0%
today but I think the the people we need
 
00:41:20.270 --> 00:41:20.280 align:start position:0%
to talk to are for example the paint
 
00:41:21.829 --> 00:41:21.839 align:start position:0%
care people because they're doing this
 
00:41:23.270 --> 00:41:23.280 align:start position:0%
right now I think a lot of good
 
00:41:24.829 --> 00:41:24.839 align:start position:0%
questions have been asked but I'm pretty
 
00:41:26.349 --> 00:41:26.359 align:start position:0%
sure that the paint care people who
 
00:41:28.910 --> 00:41:28.920 align:start position:0%
represent the manufacturers could answer
 
00:41:31.910 --> 00:41:31.920 align:start position:0%
those questions uh very quickly uh there
 
00:41:33.870 --> 00:41:33.880 align:start position:0%
I am quite certain that we are not
 
00:41:35.510 --> 00:41:35.520 align:start position:0%
thinking of questions that these folks
 
00:41:38.150 --> 00:41:38.160 align:start position:0%
haven't already thought of uh in great
 
00:41:40.349 --> 00:41:40.359 align:start position:0%
detail so with respect to our friends
 
00:41:43.710 --> 00:41:43.720 align:start position:0%
from Dees and I think we're going too
 
00:41:46.190 --> 00:41:46.200 align:start position:0%
far in the direction of Reinventing a
 
00:41:49.069 --> 00:41:49.079 align:start position:0%
wheel that uh already exists and works
 
00:41:51.630 --> 00:41:51.640 align:start position:0%
very well in lots of other places so uh
 
00:41:53.309 --> 00:41:53.319 align:start position:0%
I would like to see us move in that
 
00:41:56.510 --> 00:41:56.520 align:start position:0%
direction thank you madam chair thank
 
00:41:58.870 --> 00:41:58.880 align:start position:0%
you uh representative gerna um and to
 
00:42:00.790 --> 00:42:00.800 align:start position:0%
that to that point I think it would be
 
00:42:06.270 --> 00:42:06.280 align:start position:0%
useful if maybe um we could get together
 
00:42:09.069 --> 00:42:09.079 align:start position:0%
a list of questions I do have a contact
 
00:42:12.710 --> 00:42:12.720 align:start position:0%
UM at the codings uh textile and codings
 
00:42:14.710 --> 00:42:14.720 align:start position:0%
um as well as for paint care and I'm
 
00:42:19.670 --> 00:42:19.680 align:start position:0%
happy to um get those to them a list of
 
00:42:22.630 --> 00:42:22.640 align:start position:0%
questions so if if we are open to that
 
00:42:24.990 --> 00:42:25.000 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to uh receive those from each
 
00:42:28.190 --> 00:42:28.200 align:start position:0%
individual member um um and and we can
 
00:42:30.349 --> 00:42:30.359 align:start position:0%
pait some questions to those folks as
 
00:42:32.630 --> 00:42:32.640 align:start position:0%
well um I think the discussion has
 
00:42:34.230 --> 00:42:34.240 align:start position:0%
generated some additional questions that
 
00:42:37.390 --> 00:42:37.400 align:start position:0%
I had not um considered but I I agree I
 
00:42:43.230 --> 00:42:43.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:45.510 --> 00:42:45.520 align:start position:0%
crucial representative
 
00:42:48.309 --> 00:42:48.319 align:start position:0%
Penza oh and then I I'll definitely
 
00:42:49.870 --> 00:42:49.880 align:start position:0%
recognize the department did you have
 
00:42:51.950 --> 00:42:51.960 align:start position:0%
something on based on what I was just
 
00:42:53.630 --> 00:42:53.640 align:start position:0%
based on thank you for the opportunity
 
00:42:55.309 --> 00:42:55.319 align:start position:0%
just based on representative J's
 
00:42:57.950 --> 00:42:57.960 align:start position:0%
comments uh we did receive an email from
 
00:43:00.510 --> 00:43:00.520 align:start position:0%
Heidi mcalli at the Americans codings
 
00:43:02.990 --> 00:43:03.000 align:start position:0%
Association over the weekend um saying
 
00:43:04.670 --> 00:43:04.680 align:start position:0%
that she regretted not being able to be
 
00:43:07.270 --> 00:43:07.280 align:start position:0%
here today um but that I think that that
 
00:43:09.230 --> 00:43:09.240 align:start position:0%
organization is definitely willing to
 
00:43:12.230 --> 00:43:12.240 align:start position:0%
participate in further discussions um I
 
00:43:14.589 --> 00:43:14.599 align:start position:0%
think they were they had some concerns
 
00:43:16.470 --> 00:43:16.480 align:start position:0%
about how the the current language in
 
00:43:20.190 --> 00:43:20.200 align:start position:0%
the bill would uh not necessarily give
 
00:43:22.589 --> 00:43:22.599 align:start position:0%
control to uh some of the manufacturers
 
00:43:24.510 --> 00:43:24.520 align:start position:0%
and the way that they've made it work in
 
00:43:27.109 --> 00:43:27.119 align:start position:0%
other states so I I think is definitely
 
00:43:29.349 --> 00:43:29.359 align:start position:0%
willing to participate in the discussion
 
00:43:30.750 --> 00:43:30.760 align:start position:0%
I think they were also hoping that there
 
00:43:32.790 --> 00:43:32.800 align:start position:0%
might be an opportunity for interim
 
00:43:34.270 --> 00:43:34.280 align:start position:0%
study or something like that to really
 
00:43:36.790 --> 00:43:36.800 align:start position:0%
craft a language that might work for New
 
00:43:39.710 --> 00:43:39.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so I just wanted to add that
 
00:43:42.230 --> 00:43:42.240 align:start position:0%
no thank you I I too received that email
 
00:43:45.950 --> 00:43:45.960 align:start position:0%
so I appreciate um uh the representative
 
00:43:48.230 --> 00:43:48.240 align:start position:0%
from the American codings Association
 
00:43:51.069 --> 00:43:51.079 align:start position:0%
and and so I to that point I I think we
 
00:43:52.589 --> 00:43:52.599 align:start position:0%
can definitely reach back out to them it
 
00:43:54.030 --> 00:43:54.040 align:start position:0%
was unfortunate they weren't able to be
 
00:43:57.470 --> 00:43:57.480 align:start position:0%
here today um but I'm happy to uh take
 
00:44:01.109 --> 00:44:01.119 align:start position:0%
the Department's insights um the codings
 
00:44:03.109 --> 00:44:03.119 align:start position:0%
association's insights as well and and
 
00:44:04.549 --> 00:44:04.559 align:start position:0%
have a future discussion on that this
 
00:44:06.790 --> 00:44:06.800 align:start position:0%
bill is not so that we are all aware not
 
00:44:09.670 --> 00:44:09.680 align:start position:0%
due out until the 21st so we do have
 
00:44:10.910 --> 00:44:10.920 align:start position:0%
some time of
 
00:44:14.230 --> 00:44:14.240 align:start position:0%
March um so we do have some time to work
 
00:44:16.750 --> 00:44:16.760 align:start position:0%
on this concept and if we need future
 
00:44:19.069 --> 00:44:19.079 align:start position:0%
meetings to sort of hash those things
 
00:44:22.549 --> 00:44:22.559 align:start position:0%
out I'm happy to um get those things
 
00:44:24.750 --> 00:44:24.760 align:start position:0%
sort of established in together I think
 
00:44:26.910 --> 00:44:26.920 align:start position:0%
given where we are for today today I
 
00:44:29.510 --> 00:44:29.520 align:start position:0%
wanted to you know hear the last few
 
00:44:31.870 --> 00:44:31.880 align:start position:0%
moments of thoughts and kind of from the
 
00:44:33.390 --> 00:44:33.400 align:start position:0%
subcommittee and get some general
 
00:44:34.990 --> 00:44:35.000 align:start position:0%
direction of where where we should go
 
00:44:37.549 --> 00:44:37.559 align:start position:0%
next but um we do have a 10: a start
 
00:44:39.309 --> 00:44:39.319 align:start position:0%
time and I want to be respectful of that
 
00:44:41.670 --> 00:44:41.680 align:start position:0%
for the hearings um for the rest of the
 
00:44:41.680 --> 00:44:42.589 align:start position:0%
for the hearings um for the rest of the
day

00:44:42.589 --> 00:44:42.599 align:start position:0%
day
 
00:44:45.950 --> 00:44:45.960 align:start position:0%
so representative Penza I can start off
 
00:44:48.430 --> 00:44:48.440 align:start position:0%
um I just wanted to you know kind of
 
00:44:51.309 --> 00:44:51.319 align:start position:0%
ditto on what representative ger said uh
 
00:44:55.069 --> 00:44:55.079 align:start position:0%
I don't think we have to um reinvent
 
00:44:57.150 --> 00:44:57.160 align:start position:0%
anything I think this is is uh it's
 
00:44:58.829 --> 00:44:58.839 align:start position:0%
something that's successful and ongoing
 
00:45:00.630 --> 00:45:00.640 align:start position:0%
and I would love to talk to our
 
00:45:03.190 --> 00:45:03.200 align:start position:0%
neighbors and see how it wasle
 
00:45:05.069 --> 00:45:05.079 align:start position:0%
implemented what they what they put
 
00:45:06.710 --> 00:45:06.720 align:start position:0%
together for legislation all of that
 
00:45:10.030 --> 00:45:10.040 align:start position:0%
kind of stuff um having manufacturers
 
00:45:11.990 --> 00:45:12.000 align:start position:0%
that are already on board with this
 
00:45:14.870 --> 00:45:14.880 align:start position:0%
having the codings um those folks not
 
00:45:16.750 --> 00:45:16.760 align:start position:0%
you know so Dees doesn't have to have
 
00:45:18.510 --> 00:45:18.520 align:start position:0%
their hands in it it's it's a it's a
 
00:45:20.390 --> 00:45:20.400 align:start position:0%
well-run and if we start off with a
 
00:45:22.910 --> 00:45:22.920 align:start position:0%
pilot because that's the way to do it
 
00:45:25.109 --> 00:45:25.119 align:start position:0%
then that's fine with me too I just I
 
00:45:26.990 --> 00:45:27.000 align:start position:0%
think this is something that we could we
 
00:45:29.630 --> 00:45:29.640 align:start position:0%
can definitely make happen if however we
 
00:45:31.990 --> 00:45:32.000 align:start position:0%
need to tighten up legislation remove
 
00:45:34.349 --> 00:45:34.359 align:start position:0%
lines add lines or whatever so it it
 
00:45:36.230 --> 00:45:36.240 align:start position:0%
matches exactly what programs are
 
00:45:38.630 --> 00:45:38.640 align:start position:0%
currently successful and how they um
 
00:45:41.150 --> 00:45:41.160 align:start position:0%
took off then I think that is something
 
00:45:43.230 --> 00:45:43.240 align:start position:0%
that we can all Undertake and I'd be
 
00:45:46.549 --> 00:45:46.559 align:start position:0%
happy to you know uh be a contact with
 
00:45:53.510 --> 00:45:53.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:58.270 --> 00:45:58.280 align:start position:0%
so okay so with that I you know I I
 
00:45:59.990 --> 00:46:00.000 align:start position:0%
think what I'd like to do is maybe
 
00:46:02.109 --> 00:46:02.119 align:start position:0%
schedule another subcommittee work
 
00:46:04.150 --> 00:46:04.160 align:start position:0%
session to sort of once I have the
 
00:46:05.710 --> 00:46:05.720 align:start position:0%
opportunity to reach back out to some of
 
00:46:08.150 --> 00:46:08.160 align:start position:0%
the other stakeholders ensure that they
 
00:46:10.870 --> 00:46:10.880 align:start position:0%
can all be here for the the day and also
 
00:46:12.990 --> 00:46:13.000 align:start position:0%
pait any questions that we have going
 
00:46:15.069 --> 00:46:15.079 align:start position:0%
forward from today's meeting that we
 
00:46:17.630 --> 00:46:17.640 align:start position:0%
would like answered from the ACA then I
 
00:46:20.470 --> 00:46:20.480 align:start position:0%
think that we should do that and um if
 
00:46:23.190 --> 00:46:23.200 align:start position:0%
there's anything else that I
 
00:46:26.549 --> 00:46:26.559 align:start position:0%
haven't omitted or or not addressed
 
00:46:28.870 --> 00:46:28.880 align:start position:0%
I don't know if any of the other members
 
00:46:31.990 --> 00:46:32.000 align:start position:0%
have any other final thoughts um again I
 
00:46:33.630 --> 00:46:33.640 align:start position:0%
just want to make sure that we we can
 
00:46:36.630 --> 00:46:36.640 align:start position:0%
get some of those um answers to some of
 
00:46:40.150 --> 00:46:40.160 align:start position:0%

session for HB 1386 relative to
 
01:03:47.309 --> 01:03:47.319 align:start position:0%
prohibiting the disposal of lithium ion
 
01:03:50.230 --> 01:03:50.240 align:start position:0%
batteries um in Solid Waste landfill
 
01:03:53.109 --> 01:03:53.119 align:start position:0%
facilities composting facilities or
 
01:03:57.150 --> 01:03:57.160 align:start position:0%
incinerators and and I will uh be making
 
01:04:02.069 --> 01:04:02.079 align:start position:0%
a motion for uh on OTP on the amendment
 
01:04:05.230 --> 01:04:05.240 align:start position:0%
for that which is we need to adopt the
 
01:04:08.230 --> 01:04:08.240 align:start position:0%
amendment oh to adopt the
 
01:04:11.870 --> 01:04:11.880 align:start position:0%
amendment of um
 
01:04:11.880 --> 01:04:13.710 align:start position:0%
amendment of um
20244

01:04:13.710 --> 01:04:13.720 align:start position:0%
20244
 
01:04:16.549 --> 01:04:16.559 align:start position:0%
97h submitted by representative Karen
 
01:04:16.559 --> 01:04:17.990 align:start position:0%
97h submitted by representative Karen
evil

01:04:17.990 --> 01:04:18.000 align:start position:0%
evil
 
01:04:20.829 --> 01:04:20.839 align:start position:0%
evil uh so I move uh to adopt that
 
01:04:24.230 --> 01:04:24.240 align:start position:0%
Amendment do I hear a second I will
 
01:04:26.349 --> 01:04:26.359 align:start position:0%
second that thank you representative
 
01:04:30.069 --> 01:04:30.079 align:start position:0%
Bixby so um I will speak to this uh
 
01:04:32.589 --> 01:04:32.599 align:start position:0%
motion I believe it's uh very important
 
01:04:35.150 --> 01:04:35.160 align:start position:0%
that um this bill go forward we have
 
01:04:38.349 --> 01:04:38.359 align:start position:0%
seen lithium ion batteries and heard
 
01:04:41.549 --> 01:04:41.559 align:start position:0%
through testimony um they are can be
 
01:04:44.269 --> 01:04:44.279 align:start position:0%
very dangerous at our uh facilities
 
01:04:47.710 --> 01:04:47.720 align:start position:0%
causing fires and damage uh it makes
 
01:04:49.750 --> 01:04:49.760 align:start position:0%
sense to uh leave them out of our
 
01:04:52.549 --> 01:04:52.559 align:start position:0%
landfills and and uh composting
 
01:04:54.870 --> 01:04:54.880 align:start position:0%
facilities and incinerators
 
01:05:00.589 --> 01:05:00.599 align:start position:0%
um the what the amendment does is also
 
01:05:04.349 --> 01:05:04.359 align:start position:0%
um um it makes it so that if somebody
 
01:05:06.710 --> 01:05:06.720 align:start position:0%
tosses one of those
 
01:05:10.870 --> 01:05:10.880 align:start position:0%
into um in landfills uh landfill
 
01:05:13.390 --> 01:05:13.400 align:start position:0%
facility or composting facility or
 
01:05:15.670 --> 01:05:15.680 align:start position:0%
incinerator by accident that they won't
 
01:05:20.710 --> 01:05:20.720 align:start position:0%
be held liable for it um this bill also
 
01:05:24.390 --> 01:05:24.400 align:start position:0%
expands a little bit and clarifies um
 
01:05:28.029 --> 01:05:28.039 align:start position:0%
the definition of electronic waste and I
 
01:05:30.910 --> 01:05:30.920 align:start position:0%
believe it's a good bill so I support it
 
01:05:35.230 --> 01:05:35.240 align:start position:0%
do we hear any discussion for this
 
01:05:39.789 --> 01:05:39.799 align:start position:0%
bill represent Bixby um so I think that
 
01:05:41.990 --> 01:05:42.000 align:start position:0%
the the bill as amended makes a lot of
 
01:05:43.990 --> 01:05:44.000 align:start position:0%
sense we heard we there was a question
 
01:05:45.950 --> 01:05:45.960 align:start position:0%
about whether we should include lithium
 
01:05:49.910 --> 01:05:49.920 align:start position:0%
as well as lithium ions and uh there was
 
01:05:52.589 --> 01:05:52.599 align:start position:0%
we heard uh information that suggested
 
01:05:54.549 --> 01:05:54.559 align:start position:0%
that that probably wasn't the the best
 
01:05:56.190 --> 01:05:56.200 align:start position:0%
because it could uh create more
 
01:05:59.549 --> 01:05:59.559 align:start position:0%
confusion and the lithium uh not in
 
01:06:03.670 --> 01:06:03.680 align:start position:0%
ionic form is not as uh problematic uh
 
01:06:07.269 --> 01:06:07.279 align:start position:0%
so that um having this uh just targeted
 
01:06:10.349 --> 01:06:10.359 align:start position:0%
the lithium ion is
 
01:06:13.910 --> 01:06:13.920 align:start position:0%
better okay any other discussion on this
 
01:06:18.029 --> 01:06:18.039 align:start position:0%
bill seeing none I would like the um
 
01:06:20.750 --> 01:06:20.760 align:start position:0%

01:08:50.149 --> 01:08:50.159 align:start position:0%
motion uh I would like to move itl on
 
01:08:53.390 --> 01:08:53.400 align:start position:0%
this bill do I hear a second yes I
 
01:08:55.669 --> 01:08:55.679 align:start position:0%
second that motion Mr
 
01:08:58.269 --> 01:08:58.279 align:start position:0%
Bixby so thank you representative kulan
 
01:09:00.030 --> 01:09:00.040 align:start position:0%
would you like to speak to your motion
 
01:09:01.430 --> 01:09:01.440 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby I would like to
 
01:09:04.910 --> 01:09:04.920 align:start position:0%
speak to um so uh what this bill
 
01:09:09.349 --> 01:09:09.359 align:start position:0%
proposed doing was um Banning the use of
 
01:09:12.990 --> 01:09:13.000 align:start position:0%
the uh chasing arrows recycling label
 
01:09:16.149 --> 01:09:16.159 align:start position:0%
for uh packaging that didn't meet
 
01:09:19.550 --> 01:09:19.560 align:start position:0%
certain uh thresholds of recyc of
 
01:09:22.470 --> 01:09:22.480 align:start position:0%
actually being recycled the notion was
 
01:09:25.910 --> 01:09:25.920 align:start position:0%
that uh having the packaging saying it
 
01:09:27.149 --> 01:09:27.159 align:start position:0%
could be
 
01:09:30.110 --> 01:09:30.120 align:start position:0%
recycled that it was recyclable but it
 
01:09:32.229 --> 01:09:32.239 align:start position:0%
not actually getting recycled was
 
01:09:37.149 --> 01:09:37.159 align:start position:0%
deceptive and that uh that this would uh
 
01:09:39.829 --> 01:09:39.839 align:start position:0%
remove that deception from the
 
01:09:42.870 --> 01:09:42.880 align:start position:0%
marketplace uh and there are a couple of
 
01:09:45.630 --> 01:09:45.640 align:start position:0%
problems with this one is that if you
 
01:09:48.269 --> 01:09:48.279 align:start position:0%
don't have the numbers on the uh
 
01:09:50.950 --> 01:09:50.960 align:start position:0%
packaging then even less will get
 
01:09:54.070 --> 01:09:54.080 align:start position:0%
recycled uh and so because you need
 
01:09:55.990 --> 01:09:56.000 align:start position:0%
those numbers to be able to do Source
 
01:09:59.470 --> 01:09:59.480 align:start position:0%
separation of of the packaging uh the
 
01:10:02.350 --> 01:10:02.360 align:start position:0%
other issue is that uh we in New
 
01:10:04.510 --> 01:10:04.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire don't actually have control
 
01:10:07.430 --> 01:10:07.440 align:start position:0%
over the printing of those labels on the
 
01:10:11.229 --> 01:10:11.239 align:start position:0%
packages and uh it would be uh pretty
 
01:10:14.430 --> 01:10:14.440 align:start position:0%
much impossible to enforce so uh for
 
01:10:18.070 --> 01:10:18.080 align:start position:0%
those reasons I suggesting we want an
 
01:10:21.350 --> 01:10:21.360 align:start position:0%
itl okay representative Murray thank you
 
01:10:23.149 --> 01:10:23.159 align:start position:0%
and I'd like to you know though though
 
01:10:25.189 --> 01:10:25.199 align:start position:0%
the member um presenting the bill um was
 
01:10:27.030 --> 01:10:27.040 align:start position:0%
well intended and I and I definitely
 
01:10:29.990 --> 01:10:30.000 align:start position:0%
understand the frustration around um
 
01:10:32.669 --> 01:10:32.679 align:start position:0%
recycling um and the complexities of it
 
01:10:34.630 --> 01:10:34.640 align:start position:0%
we currently only in the state recycle
 
01:10:38.550 --> 01:10:38.560 align:start position:0%
about 26% of our recyclables and I I too
 
01:10:39.750 --> 01:10:39.760 align:start position:0%
share the same concerns that
 
01:10:41.470 --> 01:10:41.480 align:start position:0%
representative bxs we had that perhaps
 
01:10:44.510 --> 01:10:44.520 align:start position:0%
this would increase um or decrease our
 
01:10:47.790 --> 01:10:47.800 align:start position:0%
Recycling and and in addition to um the
 
01:10:51.390 --> 01:10:51.400 align:start position:0%
sort of um Federal sort of oversight
 
01:10:52.870 --> 01:10:52.880 align:start position:0%
around recycling there's also an
 
01:10:54.950 --> 01:10:54.960 align:start position:0%
international sort sort of recognition
 
01:10:57.590 --> 01:10:57.600 align:start position:0%
of the chasing arrows and whether or not
 
01:11:00.430 --> 01:11:00.440 align:start position:0%
um we were to REM remove that um I think
 
01:11:03.189 --> 01:11:03.199 align:start position:0%
could also further complicate
 
01:11:05.590 --> 01:11:05.600 align:start position:0%
things thank you I concur with what's
 
01:11:05.600 --> 01:11:06.390 align:start position:0%
things thank you I concur with what's
been

01:11:06.390 --> 01:11:06.400 align:start position:0%
been
 
01:11:08.830 --> 01:11:08.840 align:start position:0%
said is there any other discussion
 
01:11:11.310 --> 01:11:11.320 align:start position:0%
representative German thank you madam
 
01:11:15.870 --> 01:11:15.880 align:start position:0%
chair uh and I understand and the and
 
01:11:18.750 --> 01:11:18.760 align:start position:0%
agree with the criticisms of the bill
 
01:11:21.750 --> 01:11:21.760 align:start position:0%
the one thing I did want to say that I
 
01:11:24.590 --> 01:11:24.600 align:start position:0%
think is UN that I think that the bill
 
01:11:27.830 --> 01:11:27.840 align:start position:0%
would do and it's unfortunate that we
 
01:11:29.350 --> 01:11:29.360 align:start position:0%
don't have another mechanism for it is
 
01:11:31.750 --> 01:11:31.760 align:start position:0%
as representative Kaplan points out it
 
01:11:33.630 --> 01:11:33.640 align:start position:0%
would provide the Attorney General with
 
01:11:35.590 --> 01:11:35.600 align:start position:0%
another tool in the toolbox we worry
 
01:11:37.470 --> 01:11:37.480 align:start position:0%
about enforcement and I agree with that
 
01:11:40.110 --> 01:11:40.120 align:start position:0%
concern representative kaplan's argument
 
01:11:42.270 --> 01:11:42.280 align:start position:0%
was that this is not something that the
 
01:11:44.950 --> 01:11:44.960 align:start position:0%
attorney general has to act on right if
 
01:11:48.790 --> 01:11:48.800 align:start position:0%
it exists in statute but it is uh a tool
 
01:11:52.070 --> 01:11:52.080 align:start position:0%
uh that could be used and and uh
 
01:11:55.870 --> 01:11:55.880 align:start position:0%
given the fact that this is I think a a
 
01:11:57.510 --> 01:11:57.520 align:start position:0%
problem that needs in some way to be
 
01:12:00.709 --> 01:12:00.719 align:start position:0%
addressed I regret that that isn't the
 
01:12:02.070 --> 01:12:02.080 align:start position:0%
case that the Attorney General doesn't
 
01:12:04.149 --> 01:12:04.159 align:start position:0%
have this kind of tool in order to try
 
01:12:07.030 --> 01:12:07.040 align:start position:0%
to uh make sure the manufacturers are
 
01:12:08.950 --> 01:12:08.960 align:start position:0%
actually being honest with consumers but
 
01:12:10.910 --> 01:12:10.920 align:start position:0%
I also recognize the limitations of the
 
01:12:13.750 --> 01:12:13.760 align:start position:0%
bill as uh as my colleagues have pointed
 
01:12:16.030 --> 01:12:16.040 align:start position:0%
out thank you thank you for that any
 
01:12:18.750 --> 01:12:18.760 align:start position:0%
other comments on this seeing none I
 
01:12:20.990 --> 01:12:21.000 align:start position:0%

1681 um which is uh relative to sell of

products labeled as biodegradable or
 
01:13:25.510 --> 01:13:25.520 align:start position:0%
compostable do I hear motion represent
 
01:13:28.870 --> 01:13:28.880 align:start position:0%
Bixby yes uh I'd like to move itl and

representative kulan go ahead
 
01:13:39.189 --> 01:13:39.199 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby let's Okay so the
 
01:13:42.790 --> 01:13:42.800 align:start position:0%
idea behind this bill is that uh there
 
01:13:44.830 --> 01:13:44.840 align:start position:0%
are there there is packaging that is
 
01:13:47.870 --> 01:13:47.880 align:start position:0%
sold uh primarily to restaurants that is
 
01:13:51.510 --> 01:13:51.520 align:start position:0%
labeled as being compostable and uh not
 
01:13:52.950 --> 01:13:52.960 align:start position:0%
all of it necessarily meets the
 
01:13:55.390 --> 01:13:55.400 align:start position:0%
standards that would make it actually
 
01:13:58.070 --> 01:13:58.080 align:start position:0%
compostable uh and uh but there are in
 
01:14:02.350 --> 01:14:02.360 align:start position:0%
fact standards uh by uh put for for
 
01:14:05.950 --> 01:14:05.960 align:start position:0%
forth bym which is a a standards um
 
01:14:09.669 --> 01:14:09.679 align:start position:0%
promulgating uh body that uh that
 
01:14:12.310 --> 01:14:12.320 align:start position:0%
actually do say these items with these
 
01:14:15.350 --> 01:14:15.360 align:start position:0%
characteristics are uh are in fact
 
01:14:19.070 --> 01:14:19.080 align:start position:0%
compostable and uh what this bill would
 
01:14:22.790 --> 01:14:22.800 align:start position:0%
have done is require that uh anything
 
01:14:26.790 --> 01:14:26.800 align:start position:0%
that was labeled as compostable be uh
 
01:14:30.590 --> 01:14:30.600 align:start position:0%
have that third party um uh that third
 
01:14:34.830 --> 01:14:34.840 align:start position:0%
party certification and that the initial
 
01:14:37.669 --> 01:14:37.679 align:start position:0%
bill uh as written would have put it
 
01:14:41.070 --> 01:14:41.080 align:start position:0%
into a uh a part of the solid waste
 
01:14:44.189 --> 01:14:44.199 align:start position:0%
rules having to do with disposal but the
 
01:14:46.790 --> 01:14:46.800 align:start position:0%
department pointed out that in fact the
 
01:14:49.830 --> 01:14:49.840 align:start position:0%
correct place for that would would have
 
01:14:53.629 --> 01:14:53.639 align:start position:0%
been in uh another set of in Commerce
 
01:14:57.629 --> 01:14:57.639 align:start position:0%
statutes and uh so the prime sponsor
 
01:15:00.310 --> 01:15:00.320 align:start position:0%
came into the committee with uh a
 
01:15:01.750 --> 01:15:01.760 align:start position:0%
proposed amendment that would have put
 
01:15:05.709 --> 01:15:05.719 align:start position:0%
it into the um into the Commerce
 
01:15:08.709 --> 01:15:08.719 align:start position:0%
statutes and we looked into what it
 
01:15:10.950 --> 01:15:10.960 align:start position:0%
would take in order for this committee
 
01:15:14.830 --> 01:15:14.840 align:start position:0%
to uh amend the bill uh and we were told
 
01:15:19.870 --> 01:15:19.880 align:start position:0%
by the clerk that uh any com any uh
 
01:15:23.390 --> 01:15:23.400 align:start position:0%
amendment that we made that put the bill
 
01:15:25.310 --> 01:15:25.320 align:start position:0%
into statutes over which our committee
 
01:15:27.510 --> 01:15:27.520 align:start position:0%
doesn't have purview would be judged
 
01:15:32.149 --> 01:15:32.159 align:start position:0%
non- gerain and uh so we were in fact
 
01:15:34.629 --> 01:15:34.639 align:start position:0%
not able to make the necessary Amendment
 
01:15:37.910 --> 01:15:37.920 align:start position:0%
to the bill uh and we have suggested to
 
01:15:40.669 --> 01:15:40.679 align:start position:0%
the prime sponsor that uh he might be
 
01:15:43.750 --> 01:15:43.760 align:start position:0%
able to find a uh someone on the
 
01:15:45.590 --> 01:15:45.600 align:start position:0%
Commerce Committee who would be able to
 
01:15:47.950 --> 01:15:47.960 align:start position:0%
append it to a bill there or perhaps do
 
01:15:50.990 --> 01:15:51.000 align:start position:0%
that in the Senate uh we would have I I
 
01:15:52.590 --> 01:15:52.600 align:start position:0%
personally would have really liked this
 
01:15:56.229 --> 01:15:56.239 align:start position:0%
bill to go for forward uh I so I hope
 
01:15:58.990 --> 01:15:59.000 align:start position:0%
that he's able to find uh a sponsor to
 
01:16:01.750 --> 01:16:01.760 align:start position:0%
put it into the correct uh committee to
 
01:16:04.750 --> 01:16:04.760 align:start position:0%
have it looked at but uh sadly we can't
 
01:16:06.189 --> 01:16:06.199 align:start position:0%
do that in this committee so we have to
 
01:16:07.629 --> 01:16:07.639 align:start position:0%
Ideal the
 
01:16:10.709 --> 01:16:10.719 align:start position:0%
bill any further
 
01:16:13.830 --> 01:16:13.840 align:start position:0%

this
 
01:18:12.629 --> 01:18:12.639 align:start position:0%
amendment question representative
 
01:18:15.229 --> 01:18:15.239 align:start position:0%
Penza just a question um during the
 
01:18:17.350 --> 01:18:17.360 align:start position:0%
hearing these were the relevant statutes
 
01:18:18.910 --> 01:18:18.920 align:start position:0%
that were missing out of there that we
 
01:18:20.310 --> 01:18:20.320 align:start position:0%
wanted to make sure that they were in
 
01:18:21.910 --> 01:18:21.920 align:start position:0%
correct so we're kind of covering our
 
01:18:24.350 --> 01:18:24.360 align:start position:0%
bases now okay
 
01:18:28.510 --> 01:18:28.520 align:start position:0%
yes and uh what we had heard from
 
01:18:31.470 --> 01:18:31.480 align:start position:0%
um Department of administrative Services
 
01:18:35.470 --> 01:18:35.480 align:start position:0%
is that this by doing this we will uh
 
01:18:39.709 --> 01:18:39.719 align:start position:0%
improve um the RSA compliance for this
 
01:18:44.510 --> 01:18:44.520 align:start position:0%
as we um require that it be included in
 
01:18:46.990 --> 01:18:47.000 align:start position:0%
contracts so I think this is this is
 
01:18:50.350 --> 01:18:50.360 align:start position:0%
really good legislation represent Murray
 
01:18:52.149 --> 01:18:52.159 align:start position:0%
and thank you madam chair and just it is

chair representative rad go right ahead
 
01:21:15.070 --> 01:21:15.080 align:start position:0%

would you like to speak to your motion
 
01:21:29.189 --> 01:21:29.199 align:start position:0%
yes so what this bill um was looking at
 
01:21:31.750 --> 01:21:31.760 align:start position:0%
it was existing Brownfield sites in New
 
01:21:35.709 --> 01:21:35.719 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and um trying to use those for
 
01:21:35.719 --> 01:21:36.910 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and um trying to use those for
new

01:21:36.910 --> 01:21:36.920 align:start position:0%
new
 
01:21:39.750 --> 01:21:39.760 align:start position:0%
landfills while it does make sense you
 
01:21:40.870 --> 01:21:40.880 align:start position:0%
know these sites are already
 
01:21:42.709 --> 01:21:42.719 align:start position:0%
contaminated so let's let's use them
 
01:21:47.510 --> 01:21:47.520 align:start position:0%
from landfills due to the proximity
 
01:21:50.070 --> 01:21:50.080 align:start position:0%
location number of other factors
 
01:21:52.310 --> 01:21:52.320 align:start position:0%
including new ruling uh it doesn't make
 
01:21:54.830 --> 01:21:54.840 align:start position:0%
sense to do it right now and so uh
 
01:21:54.840 --> 01:21:56.070 align:start position:0%
sense to do it right now and so uh
therefore

01:21:56.070 --> 01:21:56.080 align:start position:0%
therefore
 
01:21:59.229 --> 01:21:59.239 align:start position:0%
IO okay any other discussion on this
 
01:22:01.390 --> 01:22:01.400 align:start position:0%
bill representative H Haskins thank you
 
01:22:03.629 --> 01:22:03.639 align:start position:0%
madam chair I just wanted to say that I
 
01:22:05.510 --> 01:22:05.520 align:start position:0%
thought it was very educational the
 
01:22:07.470 --> 01:22:07.480 align:start position:0%
conversation that we had about
 
01:22:10.950 --> 01:22:10.960 align:start position:0%
brownfields um I think that landfill
 
01:22:14.310 --> 01:22:14.320 align:start position:0%
sighting is such an important issue for
 
01:22:18.550 --> 01:22:18.560 align:start position:0%
us that we need to think long and hard
 
01:22:22.270 --> 01:22:22.280 align:start position:0%
before we okay anything that's going in
 
01:22:24.669 --> 01:22:24.679 align:start position:0%
say land and gravel for instance if the
 
01:22:26.669 --> 01:22:26.679 align:start position:0%
brown fields are not acceptable there
 
01:22:30.430 --> 01:22:30.440 align:start position:0%
are certainly other types of environment
 
01:22:33.750 --> 01:22:33.760 align:start position:0%
that are not acceptable as well thank
 
01:22:35.229 --> 01:22:35.239 align:start position:0%
you thank you representative H Haskins
 
01:22:37.750 --> 01:22:37.760 align:start position:0%
and I I would like to add to that that I
 
01:22:40.430 --> 01:22:40.440 align:start position:0%
agree even though there are you know 313
 
01:22:42.950 --> 01:22:42.960 align:start position:0%
Brownfield sites in New Hampshire they
 
01:22:46.830 --> 01:22:46.840 align:start position:0%
do seem in in looking at the list uh
 
01:22:50.669 --> 01:22:50.679 align:start position:0%
very limited in their ability to be
 
01:22:54.870 --> 01:22:54.880 align:start position:0%
repurposed as as landfill sites um but I
 
01:22:58.310 --> 01:22:58.320 align:start position:0%
I I would hope that we someone on the
 
01:23:01.390 --> 01:23:01.400 align:start position:0%
committee or someone else uh in our in
 
01:23:01.400 --> 01:23:02.390 align:start position:0%
committee or someone else uh in our in
our

01:23:02.390 --> 01:23:02.400 align:start position:0%
our
 
01:23:05.030 --> 01:23:05.040 align:start position:0%
legislature um would come up with some
 
01:23:07.590 --> 01:23:07.600 align:start position:0%
legislation that might uh
 
01:23:13.350 --> 01:23:13.360 align:start position:0%
help point us to policy that would allow
 
01:23:17.870 --> 01:23:17.880 align:start position:0%
us to promote brownfields to be used for
 
01:23:20.030 --> 01:23:20.040 align:start position:0%
some other kind of useful purposes such
 
01:23:24.030 --> 01:23:24.040 align:start position:0%
as recycling centers place to put solar
 
01:23:27.709 --> 01:23:27.719 align:start position:0%
arrays or um you know that those kinds
 
01:23:31.149 --> 01:23:31.159 align:start position:0%
of things so um I I I would hope to see
 
01:23:33.790 --> 01:23:33.800 align:start position:0%
some kind of Bill come forward in the
 
01:23:39.030 --> 01:23:39.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:41.990 --> 01:23:42.000 align:start position:0%
Penza yeah I just wanted to you know
 
01:23:44.590 --> 01:23:44.600 align:start position:0%
second what you said I I I think it was
 
01:23:46.790 --> 01:23:46.800 align:start position:0%
um I think it was a great it was it was
 
01:23:48.070 --> 01:23:48.080 align:start position:0%
a great hearing there was a lot of
 
01:23:50.149 --> 01:23:50.159 align:start position:0%
things that were brought up and uh I'd
 
01:23:51.510 --> 01:23:51.520 align:start position:0%
love to be able to use these sites I
 
01:23:53.149 --> 01:23:53.159 align:start position:0%
don't think it's and there's probably
 
01:23:55.550 --> 01:23:55.560 align:start position:0%
not many or even one that would be for
 
01:23:57.790 --> 01:23:57.800 align:start position:0%
landfills but I think there's tons of
 
01:23:59.510 --> 01:23:59.520 align:start position:0%
opportunities to be able to use these
 
01:24:02.910 --> 01:24:02.920 align:start position:0%
properties for yeah transfer station
 
01:24:05.189 --> 01:24:05.199 align:start position:0%
recycling station there's a lot of
 
01:24:06.430 --> 01:24:06.440 align:start position:0%
different opportunities that I think
 
01:24:08.990 --> 01:24:09.000 align:start position:0%
that we can use these and um and I'm
 
01:24:12.030 --> 01:24:12.040 align:start position:0%
hoping that I can grab someone hey Nick
 
01:24:14.709 --> 01:24:14.719 align:start position:0%
um to maybe put some legislation in next
 
01:24:16.709 --> 01:24:16.719 align:start position:0%
time around all right then
 
01:24:19.189 --> 01:24:19.199 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby yeah I I think a
 
01:24:20.870 --> 01:24:20.880 align:start position:0%
lot of what I was going to touch on has
 
01:24:23.110 --> 01:24:23.120 align:start position:0%
been said but I just wanted one of the
 
01:24:26.030 --> 01:24:26.040 align:start position:0%
things that became clear in the hearing
 
01:24:30.590 --> 01:24:30.600 align:start position:0%
was that uh the what the things that end
 
01:24:32.510 --> 01:24:32.520 align:start position:0%
up making a Brownfield site a Brownfield
 
01:24:34.870 --> 01:24:34.880 align:start position:0%
site are things that had to do with
 
01:24:37.229 --> 01:24:37.239 align:start position:0%
industry in the past a lot of which was
 
01:24:38.990 --> 01:24:39.000 align:start position:0%
industry which was in appropriately
 
01:24:42.149 --> 01:24:42.159 align:start position:0%
placed close to waterways uh and one of
 
01:24:43.990 --> 01:24:44.000 align:start position:0%
the things that we really need to focus
 
01:24:47.470 --> 01:24:47.480 align:start position:0%
on when we're citing landfills is uh
 
01:24:50.910 --> 01:24:50.920 align:start position:0%
making sure that the hydrogeology and
 
01:24:55.629 --> 01:24:55.639 align:start position:0%
the geology uh of the site really
 
01:25:00.149 --> 01:25:00.159 align:start position:0%
minimize the possibility of uh any uh
 
01:25:05.870 --> 01:25:05.880 align:start position:0%
any leate material from the site uh
 
01:25:09.390 --> 01:25:09.400 align:start position:0%
leaving uh and that site and it sounds
 
01:25:12.390 --> 01:25:12.400 align:start position:0%
it sounded like uh few if any of the
 
01:25:14.229 --> 01:25:14.239 align:start position:0%
Brownfield sites would have met that
 
01:25:15.870 --> 01:25:15.880 align:start position:0%
criteria so we need to I think with
 
01:25:18.310 --> 01:25:18.320 align:start position:0%
Landfield sighting we really need to say
 
01:25:20.910 --> 01:25:20.920 align:start position:0%
what kind of a site do we need for a
 
01:25:23.350 --> 01:25:23.360 align:start position:0%
landfill thank you
 
01:25:25.830 --> 01:25:25.840 align:start position:0%
uh representative ger thank you madam
 
01:25:27.910 --> 01:25:27.920 align:start position:0%
chair and one of the the questions that
 
01:25:30.470 --> 01:25:30.480 align:start position:0%
I had during the hearing that I continue
 
01:25:32.669 --> 01:25:32.679 align:start position:0%
to have um
 
01:25:35.750 --> 01:25:35.760 align:start position:0%
is whether or not putting a landfill
 
01:25:38.030 --> 01:25:38.040 align:start position:0%
even aside from some of the other
 
01:25:40.750 --> 01:25:40.760 align:start position:0%
obvious problems with the current
 
01:25:43.149 --> 01:25:43.159 align:start position:0%
Brownfield sites that we have one of my
 
01:25:45.709 --> 01:25:45.719 align:start position:0%
concerns is related to what we're seeing
 
01:25:48.350 --> 01:25:48.360 align:start position:0%
right now in Bethlehem and questions
 
01:25:50.590 --> 01:25:50.600 align:start position:0%
about the existing landfill on top of an
 
01:25:52.669 --> 01:25:52.679 align:start position:0%
old landfill you know what kind of
 
01:25:54.149 --> 01:25:54.159 align:start position:0%
chemicals are we seeing going into the
 
01:25:56.470 --> 01:25:56.480 align:start position:0%
amusic river is this the possibility of
 
01:25:58.750 --> 01:25:58.760 align:start position:0%
a leak or is this because of material
 
01:26:00.790 --> 01:26:00.800 align:start position:0%
that continues to degrade in the old
 
01:26:02.870 --> 01:26:02.880 align:start position:0%
online landfill that was there and so
 
01:26:05.870 --> 01:26:05.880 align:start position:0%
one of my concerns is that if we put uh
 
01:26:09.470 --> 01:26:09.480 align:start position:0%
a landfill on top of a questionable site
 
01:26:11.430 --> 01:26:11.440 align:start position:0%
how that potentially complicates
 
01:26:13.629 --> 01:26:13.639 align:start position:0%
monitoring in the future and as I said
 
01:26:15.310 --> 01:26:15.320 align:start position:0%
the current situation in Bethlehem seems
 
01:26:18.149 --> 01:26:18.159 align:start position:0%
to be a good example of how it might
 
01:26:20.390 --> 01:26:20.400 align:start position:0%
complicate our ability to discern the
 
01:26:22.950 --> 01:26:22.960 align:start position:0%
difference between a leak and
 
01:26:25.149 --> 01:26:25.159 align:start position:0%
uh some of the other chemicals that
 
01:26:27.149 --> 01:26:27.159 align:start position:0%
remain in the surface from previous
 
01:26:31.910 --> 01:26:31.920 align:start position:0%
use good thank you any other
 
01:26:35.229 --> 01:26:35.239 align:start position:0%
discussion uh I see none so I would ask
 
01:26:37.350 --> 01:26:37.360 align:start position:0%

the exec session for HB
 
01:27:28.470 --> 01:27:28.480 align:start position:0%
1132 I open up the exec session for HB
 
01:27:31.510 --> 01:27:31.520 align:start position:0%
1170 which is requiring public benefit
 
01:27:34.030 --> 01:27:34.040 align:start position:0%
and Community impact assessments from
 
01:27:36.669 --> 01:27:36.679 align:start position:0%
the Department of Environmental Services
 
01:27:39.669 --> 01:27:39.679 align:start position:0%
do I hear a motion representative Murray
 
01:27:40.830 --> 01:27:40.840 align:start position:0%
uh thank you madam chair I'd like to
 
01:27:44.510 --> 01:27:44.520 align:start position:0%
move interim study um to house bills 7
 
01:27:49.070 --> 01:27:49.080 align:start position:0%
uh 1170 FN and I would second that would
 
01:27:50.669 --> 01:27:50.679 align:start position:0%
you like to speak to your motion I would
 
01:27:54.270 --> 01:27:54.280 align:start position:0%
Madam chair I think the uh the public uh
 
01:27:56.790 --> 01:27:56.800 align:start position:0%
benefit conversation that we have um
 
01:27:59.950 --> 01:27:59.960 align:start position:0%
that the uh sponsor had spoken to um
 
01:28:02.390 --> 01:28:02.400 align:start position:0%
around uh host communities and abing
 
01:28:05.750 --> 01:28:05.760 align:start position:0%
communities um is a worthy one that is
 
01:28:07.629 --> 01:28:07.639 align:start position:0%
worthy of of further discussion and I
 
01:28:09.030 --> 01:28:09.040 align:start position:0%
think there are some members within the
 
01:28:11.510 --> 01:28:11.520 align:start position:0%
committee who seek to look at the the
 
01:28:13.350 --> 01:28:13.360 align:start position:0%
conversation in a fuller manner around
 
01:28:16.270 --> 01:28:16.280 align:start position:0%
Net public benefit as well as um how
 
01:28:18.830 --> 01:28:18.840 align:start position:0%
this um how public benefit is actually
 
01:28:21.510 --> 01:28:21.520 align:start position:0%
determined so I'd love to see that
 
01:28:22.870 --> 01:28:22.880 align:start position:0%
further work
 
01:28:26.990 --> 01:28:27.000 align:start position:0%
yes I concur with that I um I certainly
 
01:28:29.229 --> 01:28:29.239 align:start position:0%
think you know we ought to be talking
 
01:28:32.550 --> 01:28:32.560 align:start position:0%
about a more risk benefit analysis on
 
01:28:36.350 --> 01:28:36.360 align:start position:0%
these things um my problem with the bill
 
01:28:38.709 --> 01:28:38.719 align:start position:0%
as it was written was that the there
 
01:28:42.270 --> 01:28:42.280 align:start position:0%
were mention of many different areas
 
01:28:46.470 --> 01:28:46.480 align:start position:0%
that I find difficult to quantify or at
 
01:28:49.149 --> 01:28:49.159 align:start position:0%
least they were not quantifiable in the
 
01:28:52.070 --> 01:28:52.080 align:start position:0%
way they were written in this bill um
 
01:28:54.510 --> 01:28:54.520 align:start position:0%
and and I I'm not sure what the
 
01:28:56.750 --> 01:28:56.760 align:start position:0%
assessment would actually look like for
 
01:28:59.510 --> 01:28:59.520 align:start position:0%
those particular things I mean I know
 
01:29:02.870 --> 01:29:02.880 align:start position:0%
you can quantify Noise by decibel you
 
01:29:06.709 --> 01:29:06.719 align:start position:0%
can quantify odor you can quantify how
 
01:29:09.910 --> 01:29:09.920 align:start position:0%
many trucks or traffic is is in or out
 
01:29:13.350 --> 01:29:13.360 align:start position:0%
but there are other kinds of um there
 
01:29:15.950 --> 01:29:15.960 align:start position:0%
are other kinds of things about you know
 
01:29:20.270 --> 01:29:20.280 align:start position:0%
what is potentially harmful impacts um
 
01:29:22.430 --> 01:29:22.440 align:start position:0%
how would it affect tourism
 
01:29:24.550 --> 01:29:24.560 align:start position:0%
that kind of thing there there's sort of
 
01:29:24.560 --> 01:29:25.470 align:start position:0%
that kind of thing there there's sort of
some

01:29:25.470 --> 01:29:25.480 align:start position:0%
some
 
01:29:28.390 --> 01:29:28.400 align:start position:0%
nebulous U measurements and and I think
 
01:29:30.470 --> 01:29:30.480 align:start position:0%
it Bears some discussion further
 
01:29:32.990 --> 01:29:33.000 align:start position:0%
discussion on those particular
 
01:29:35.510 --> 01:29:35.520 align:start position:0%
items representative
 
01:29:38.669 --> 01:29:38.679 align:start position:0%
Howard thank you um there also I think
 
01:29:40.870 --> 01:29:40.880 align:start position:0%
that when you have public meetings you
 
01:29:44.149 --> 01:29:44.159 align:start position:0%
um you tend to get repetitive um
 
01:29:45.669 --> 01:29:45.679 align:start position:0%
messages from sort of the same people
 
01:29:46.990 --> 01:29:47.000 align:start position:0%
attending all the time and I think it's
 
01:29:49.709 --> 01:29:49.719 align:start position:0%
hard to quantify the broader Community
 
01:29:51.990 --> 01:29:52.000 align:start position:0%
when um when you have just one segment
 
01:29:53.990 --> 01:29:54.000 align:start position:0%
of it showing up at
 
01:29:57.189 --> 01:29:57.199 align:start position:0%
meetings representative ger thank you
 
01:29:59.870 --> 01:29:59.880 align:start position:0%
madam chair and as uh one of
 
01:30:03.669 --> 01:30:03.679 align:start position:0%
the authors of the Amendments uh two
 
01:30:05.030 --> 01:30:05.040 align:start position:0%
proposed amendments that we shared with
 
01:30:07.109 --> 01:30:07.119 align:start position:0%
the committee from 1170 I certainly
 
01:30:08.870 --> 01:30:08.880 align:start position:0%
support uh inter room study and I hope
 
01:30:10.990 --> 01:30:11.000 align:start position:0%
the committee will too I I I would like
 
01:30:13.070 --> 01:30:13.080 align:start position:0%
to draw to most of our discussions Have
 
01:30:16.590 --> 01:30:16.600 align:start position:0%
Been Around the Net public benefit uh
 
01:30:19.109 --> 01:30:19.119 align:start position:0%
which I think is would be a big step
 
01:30:21.070 --> 01:30:21.080 align:start position:0%
forward but I just want to point out
 
01:30:23.030 --> 01:30:23.040 align:start position:0%
that there are two other things that are
 
01:30:25.229 --> 01:30:25.239 align:start position:0%
addressed in the Amendments that I hope
 
01:30:27.270 --> 01:30:27.280 align:start position:0%
the study the uh pardon me the interim
 
01:30:31.270 --> 01:30:31.280 align:start position:0%
study will also address one is uh the
 
01:30:33.550 --> 01:30:33.560 align:start position:0%
idea that when addressing the issue of
 
01:30:36.310 --> 01:30:36.320 align:start position:0%
net benefit a someone who's applying for
 
01:30:39.870 --> 01:30:39.880 align:start position:0%
an applicant for a permit cannot offset
 
01:30:42.790 --> 01:30:42.800 align:start position:0%
the benefits of one project against
 
01:30:44.950 --> 01:30:44.960 align:start position:0%
another that that we are evaluating
 
01:30:48.229 --> 01:30:48.239 align:start position:0%
individual projects and not saying well
 
01:30:50.629 --> 01:30:50.639 align:start position:0%
you can actually discount things that
 
01:30:53.149 --> 01:30:53.159 align:start position:0%
are happening in one Case by making a
 
01:30:56.109 --> 01:30:56.119 align:start position:0%
case that something 60 mil or 100 miles
 
01:30:59.030 --> 01:30:59.040 align:start position:0%
away offsets some of those some of those
 
01:31:01.669 --> 01:31:01.679 align:start position:0%
issues so uh that is one issue and the
 
01:31:04.189 --> 01:31:04.199 align:start position:0%
other is that we do have a very recent
 
01:31:05.950 --> 01:31:05.960 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court ruling from December
 
01:31:09.229 --> 01:31:09.239 align:start position:0%
regarding the question of capacity need
 
01:31:12.750 --> 01:31:12.760 align:start position:0%
and uh one of the Amendments deals
 
01:31:14.870 --> 01:31:14.880 align:start position:0%
specifically with that issue and says
 
01:31:18.470 --> 01:31:18.480 align:start position:0%
that if you were going to apply for a
 
01:31:20.430 --> 01:31:20.440 align:start position:0%
permit for one of these facilities you
 
01:31:22.149 --> 01:31:22.159 align:start position:0%
need to be able to demonstrate that for
 
01:31:24.709 --> 01:31:24.719 align:start position:0%
at least half of the lifetime of that
 
01:31:28.270 --> 01:31:28.280 align:start position:0%
facility there is actual need um that as
 
01:31:29.990 --> 01:31:30.000 align:start position:0%
I said addresses an issue which comes
 
01:31:32.950 --> 01:31:32.960 align:start position:0%
out of that Supreme Court ruling so uh
 
01:31:35.310 --> 01:31:35.320 align:start position:0%
and also uh along those same lines that
 
01:31:37.390 --> 01:31:37.400 align:start position:0%
that when we permit new landfill
 
01:31:40.629 --> 01:31:40.639 align:start position:0%
facilities it should be to meet need and
 
01:31:43.070 --> 01:31:43.080 align:start position:0%
we should not be opening new facilities
 
01:31:45.030 --> 01:31:45.040 align:start position:0%
uh before there is a demonstrated need
 
01:31:48.669 --> 01:31:48.679 align:start position:0%
so I just uh wanted to to uh say that I
 
01:31:50.390 --> 01:31:50.400 align:start position:0%
hope those are also issues that the
 
01:31:52.629 --> 01:31:52.639 align:start position:0%
inter room study committee will take uh
 
01:31:55.270 --> 01:31:55.280 align:start position:0%
the time to consider as part of future
 
01:31:57.350 --> 01:31:57.360 align:start position:0%
legislation okay thank
 
01:31:59.750 --> 01:31:59.760 align:start position:0%
you representative H Haskins thank you
 
01:32:03.470 --> 01:32:03.480 align:start position:0%
madam chair rookie question so what time
 
01:32:06.510 --> 01:32:06.520 align:start position:0%
frame does the interim study
 
01:32:09.470 --> 01:32:09.480 align:start position:0%
get well in some committees an interim
 
01:32:11.950 --> 01:32:11.960 align:start position:0%
study is a polite way of just killing a
 
01:32:15.350 --> 01:32:15.360 align:start position:0%
bill but in this committee I do believe
 
01:32:17.149 --> 01:32:17.159 align:start position:0%
that when we interim study something
 
01:32:19.910 --> 01:32:19.920 align:start position:0%
that we it is a promise that we will
 
01:32:23.470 --> 01:32:23.480 align:start position:0%
look at it and study it and so um I
 
01:32:26.790 --> 01:32:26.800 align:start position:0%
would suspect that our um Solid Waste
 
01:32:30.070 --> 01:32:30.080 align:start position:0%
subcommittee would um convene some time
 
01:32:30.990 --> 01:32:31.000 align:start position:0%
in the
 
01:32:35.950 --> 01:32:35.960 align:start position:0%
fall um and look at this bill and have
 
01:32:38.790 --> 01:32:38.800 align:start position:0%
some discussions about it and perhaps
 
01:32:42.229 --> 01:32:42.239 align:start position:0%
come up with um some kind of
 
01:32:44.109 --> 01:32:44.119 align:start position:0%
future uh
 
01:32:48.030 --> 01:32:48.040 align:start position:0%
legislative solution for the issue
 
01:32:50.990 --> 01:32:51.000 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby so um we're
 
01:32:54.470 --> 01:32:54.480 align:start position:0%
somewhat const strained by uh what this
 
01:32:57.870 --> 01:32:57.880 align:start position:0%
what the well what the speaker uh wants
 
01:32:59.709 --> 01:32:59.719 align:start position:0%
when the speaker is willing to let us
 
01:33:02.709 --> 01:33:02.719 align:start position:0%
start working on it uh so if we have
 
01:33:06.390 --> 01:33:06.400 align:start position:0%
finished all of our work uh by say the
 
01:33:08.070 --> 01:33:08.080 align:start position:0%
beginning of May in this committee is
 
01:33:09.790 --> 01:33:09.800 align:start position:0%
conceivable we could start working on an
 
01:33:12.510 --> 01:33:12.520 align:start position:0%
interim study at that point if we get
 
01:33:15.990 --> 01:33:16.000 align:start position:0%
permission from the speaker uh in some
 
01:33:17.270 --> 01:33:17.280 align:start position:0%
years we have been able to work on
 
01:33:19.830 --> 01:33:19.840 align:start position:0%
interim study bills in August uh that
 
01:33:21.870 --> 01:33:21.880 align:start position:0%
was not the case last year that will
 
01:33:24.109 --> 01:33:24.119 align:start position:0%
that's a question for the speaker we
 
01:33:26.550 --> 01:33:26.560 align:start position:0%
have to have the report out I Believe by
 
01:33:32.629 --> 01:33:32.639 align:start position:0%
November 1st so uh so uh if we don't
 
01:33:35.390 --> 01:33:35.400 align:start position:0%
start working on it in uh May or June
 
01:33:37.390 --> 01:33:37.400 align:start position:0%
then we would need to be working on it
 
01:33:41.109 --> 01:33:41.119 align:start position:0%
in September and October and uh in
 
01:33:45.830 --> 01:33:45.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:48.430 --> 01:33:48.440 align:start position:0%
clarification okay any other discussion
 
01:33:50.790 --> 01:33:50.800 align:start position:0%

01:33:54.149 --> 01:33:54.159 align:start position:0%

it here uh this is based on discussions
 
01:35:31.470 --> 01:35:31.480 align:start position:0%
which we had uh in committee during the
 
01:35:35.910 --> 01:35:35.920 align:start position:0%
work session this amendment would have
 
01:35:39.950 --> 01:35:39.960 align:start position:0%
the uh the pause on landfill permits go
 
01:35:44.830 --> 01:35:44.840 align:start position:0%
to 2028 as opposed to 2031 which was in
 
01:35:47.470 --> 01:35:47.480 align:start position:0%
the original Bill and i' I'd be happy to
 
01:35:48.550 --> 01:35:48.560 align:start position:0%
speak to
 
01:35:48.560 --> 01:35:50.390 align:start position:0%
speak to
the

01:35:50.390 --> 01:35:50.400 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:35:50.400 --> 01:35:53.510 align:start position:0%
the
amendment

01:35:53.510 --> 01:35:53.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:57.030 --> 01:35:57.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:59.830 --> 01:35:59.840 align:start position:0%
second um representative ger would you
 
01:36:02.229 --> 01:36:02.239 align:start position:0%
like to speak to your motion yes thank
 
01:36:04.950 --> 01:36:04.960 align:start position:0%
you madam chair so uh this is a
 
01:36:08.550 --> 01:36:08.560 align:start position:0%
compromise 2028 is a compromise 20131
 
01:36:11.030 --> 01:36:11.040 align:start position:0%
was in the original Bill there was some
 
01:36:13.189 --> 01:36:13.199 align:start position:0%
discussion about whether or not 2031 was
 
01:36:15.550 --> 01:36:15.560 align:start position:0%
an arbitrary date it was not as the as
 
01:36:19.189 --> 01:36:19.199 align:start position:0%
the prime sponsor pointed out the first
 
01:36:22.629 --> 01:36:22.639 align:start position:0%
potential uh capacity need that we would
 
01:36:26.790 --> 01:36:26.800 align:start position:0%
have is 2034 so 2031 was chosen to give
 
01:36:30.950 --> 01:36:30.960 align:start position:0%
us three years ahead of the uh of that
 
01:36:33.310 --> 01:36:33.320 align:start position:0%
time where we might actually potentially
 
01:36:36.149 --> 01:36:36.159 align:start position:0%
have some capacity issues uh if it takes
 
01:36:39.229 --> 01:36:39.239 align:start position:0%
us six to 10 years potentially to permit
 
01:36:41.669 --> 01:36:41.679 align:start position:0%
right six years puts us out at at
 
01:36:44.229 --> 01:36:44.239 align:start position:0%
2030 uh which is a date that that also
 
01:36:47.149 --> 01:36:47.159 align:start position:0%
makes sense to me but given where we
 
01:36:51.030 --> 01:36:51.040 align:start position:0%
were 2031 some folks mentioned 2027 I
 
01:36:54.149 --> 01:36:54.159 align:start position:0%
think that 2028 is a good compromise
 
01:36:56.669 --> 01:36:56.679 align:start position:0%
I've spoken with the the prime sponsor
 
01:36:58.470 --> 01:36:58.480 align:start position:0%
this is a bill that he submitted
 
01:37:00.550 --> 01:37:00.560 align:start position:0%
specifically to address the concerns of
 
01:37:00.560 --> 01:37:01.550 align:start position:0%
specifically to address the concerns of
his

01:37:01.550 --> 01:37:01.560 align:start position:0%
his
 
01:37:05.709 --> 01:37:05.719 align:start position:0%
constituents uh and he is is willing to
 
01:37:08.629 --> 01:37:08.639 align:start position:0%
uh to compromise as as we have been he's
 
01:37:11.229 --> 01:37:11.239 align:start position:0%
really concerned if we compromise even
 
01:37:12.669 --> 01:37:12.679 align:start position:0%
further and go to
 
01:37:15.910 --> 01:37:15.920 align:start position:0%
2027 so I would like to see us
 
01:37:18.350 --> 01:37:18.360 align:start position:0%
recognizing the needs of the
 
01:37:20.390 --> 01:37:20.400 align:start position:0%
representatives constituents on whose
 
01:37:22.790 --> 01:37:22.800 align:start position:0%
behalf he brought that bill um I would
 
01:37:27.270 --> 01:37:27.280 align:start position:0%
like to see us go with 2028 as a
 
01:37:29.430 --> 01:37:29.440 align:start position:0%
compromise on the date when the
 
01:37:32.629 --> 01:37:32.639 align:start position:0%
moratorium would end okay thank
 
01:37:38.350 --> 01:37:38.360 align:start position:0%
you well um I appreciate that um
 
01:37:38.360 --> 01:37:39.870 align:start position:0%
you well um I appreciate that um
Amendment

01:37:39.870 --> 01:37:39.880 align:start position:0%
Amendment
 
01:37:42.390 --> 01:37:42.400 align:start position:0%
um I gave it some thought over the
 
01:37:44.270 --> 01:37:44.280 align:start position:0%
weekend and I know we battered around
 
01:37:48.390 --> 01:37:48.400 align:start position:0%
2028 2027 I feel more comfortable with a
 
01:37:51.950 --> 01:37:51.960 align:start position:0%
2027 date simply because
 
01:37:53.669 --> 01:37:53.679 align:start position:0%
you know I know we're
 
01:37:57.709 --> 01:37:57.719 align:start position:0%
making um some policy changes and Dees
 
01:38:01.470 --> 01:38:01.480 align:start position:0%
is working through um rule updates and I
 
01:38:03.510 --> 01:38:03.520 align:start position:0%
think with also some of the other policy
 
01:38:06.350 --> 01:38:06.360 align:start position:0%
changes there will be some some new rule
 
01:38:09.629 --> 01:38:09.639 align:start position:0%
updates that will be um implemented too
 
01:38:11.550 --> 01:38:11.560 align:start position:0%
and I think that you know giving it
 
01:38:14.990 --> 01:38:15.000 align:start position:0%
until 2027 for for all the dust to
 
01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:16.550 align:start position:0%
until 2027 for for all the dust to
settle

01:38:16.550 --> 01:38:16.560 align:start position:0%
settle
 
01:38:19.550 --> 01:38:19.560 align:start position:0%
um is is more I don't know I feel more
 
01:38:21.629 --> 01:38:21.639 align:start position:0%
comfortable with that date as opposed to
 
01:38:25.669 --> 01:38:25.679 align:start position:0%
waiting yet one more year for um for
 
01:38:28.910 --> 01:38:28.920 align:start position:0%
this pause I do believe we should have a
 
01:38:32.629 --> 01:38:32.639 align:start position:0%
pause but I don't know that I want to um
 
01:38:36.390 --> 01:38:36.400 align:start position:0%
to wait a full four years I I would be
 
01:38:39.030 --> 01:38:39.040 align:start position:0%
more comfortable with uh 2027 as being
 
01:38:43.270 --> 01:38:43.280 align:start position:0%
the date representative Bixby yeah so
 
01:38:46.750 --> 01:38:46.760 align:start position:0%
um one of the one of the uh pieces of
 
01:38:49.910 --> 01:38:49.920 align:start position:0%
commentary we got in our email was a uh
 
01:38:51.870 --> 01:38:51.880 align:start position:0%
a letter from the
 
01:38:53.629 --> 01:38:53.639 align:start position:0%
Society for protection of New Hampshire
 
01:38:55.990 --> 01:38:56.000 align:start position:0%
forests and they were strongly in
 
01:38:57.430 --> 01:38:57.440 align:start position:0%
support of this bill actually with the
 
01:39:01.990 --> 01:39:02.000 align:start position:0%
original 3030 2031 uh date uh and I
 
01:39:06.149 --> 01:39:06.159 align:start position:0%
think that uh what they uh talked about
 
01:39:09.070 --> 01:39:09.080 align:start position:0%
was the importance of making sure that
 
01:39:13.830 --> 01:39:13.840 align:start position:0%
we don't site a landfill where uh
 
01:39:15.910 --> 01:39:15.920 align:start position:0%
basically any any landfill sighting is
 
01:39:19.470 --> 01:39:19.480 align:start position:0%
going to be a permanent sighting uh so
 
01:39:22.229 --> 01:39:22.239 align:start position:0%
uh they uh felt that an abundance of
 
01:39:24.510 --> 01:39:24.520 align:start position:0%
caution was really necessary in terms of
 
01:39:27.390 --> 01:39:27.400 align:start position:0%
making those sighting decisions and felt
 
01:39:32.070 --> 01:39:32.080 align:start position:0%
that uh by uh pushing it out 20 to 2031
 
01:39:34.669 --> 01:39:34.679 align:start position:0%
it would in fact uh provide us the
 
01:39:37.629 --> 01:39:37.639 align:start position:0%
capacity to really uh establish the
 
01:39:41.270 --> 01:39:41.280 align:start position:0%
criteria as as well as possible and um I
 
01:39:43.550 --> 01:39:43.560 align:start position:0%
recognize that there are that it could
 
01:39:45.149 --> 01:39:45.159 align:start position:0%
be problematic to push it all the way
 
01:39:48.390 --> 01:39:48.400 align:start position:0%
out to 2021 I think that 2028 is the
 
01:39:53.189 --> 01:39:53.199 align:start position:0%
best uh uh date to to uh so 2028 is the
 
01:39:56.990 --> 01:39:57.000 align:start position:0%
best date to uh meet what uh we we are
 
01:39:59.669 --> 01:39:59.679 align:start position:0%
hearing from the our constituents in the
 
01:40:03.030 --> 01:40:03.040 align:start position:0%
North country and also from the for
 
01:40:06.030 --> 01:40:06.040 align:start position:0%
society repr presum Howard thank you
 
01:40:08.870 --> 01:40:08.880 align:start position:0%
madam chair um two things I you know
 
01:40:11.629 --> 01:40:11.639 align:start position:0%
2027 is like two and a half years from
 
01:40:13.629 --> 01:40:13.639 align:start position:0%
now or by the time the bill goes into
 
01:40:15.030 --> 01:40:15.040 align:start position:0%
effect it'll be only two and a half
 
01:40:17.189 --> 01:40:17.199 align:start position:0%
years and I think that's insufficient
 
01:40:19.550 --> 01:40:19.560 align:start position:0%
especially given that um when our bill
 
01:40:23.510 --> 01:40:23.520 align:start position:0%
that had a moratorium attached um failed
 
01:40:26.430 --> 01:40:26.440 align:start position:0%
there a permit was was an application
 
01:40:28.270 --> 01:40:28.280 align:start position:0%
went in for a permit in between that's
 
01:40:30.629 --> 01:40:30.639 align:start position:0%
now in the direct the doj because we
 
01:40:31.790 --> 01:40:31.800 align:start position:0%
don't know if it'll go under the old
 
01:40:33.310 --> 01:40:33.320 align:start position:0%
rules or the new rules and I think we
 
01:40:37.070 --> 01:40:37.080 align:start position:0%
need sufficient time to to make these
 
01:40:37.080 --> 01:40:39.589 align:start position:0%
need sufficient time to to make these
criteria

01:40:39.589 --> 01:40:39.599 align:start position:0%
criteria
 
01:40:42.390 --> 01:40:42.400 align:start position:0%
sound representative H Haskins thank you
 
01:40:44.830 --> 01:40:44.840 align:start position:0%
madam chair I've thought a lot about
 
01:40:49.229 --> 01:40:49.239 align:start position:0%
this I am more comfortable with 31 I
 
01:40:52.750 --> 01:40:52.760 align:start position:0%
can't support 27 I can't support 28
 
01:40:55.990 --> 01:40:56.000 align:start position:0%
there are um Maneuvers going on right
 
01:40:58.870 --> 01:40:58.880 align:start position:0%
now as we sit here and I am thinking
 
01:41:00.950 --> 01:41:00.960 align:start position:0%
about our
 
01:41:05.510 --> 01:41:05.520 align:start position:0%
constituents who need to be apprised of
 
01:41:10.030 --> 01:41:10.040 align:start position:0%
what's going on and need time to respond
 
01:41:14.189 --> 01:41:14.199 align:start position:0%
to both Dees and the applicant so um
 
01:41:16.310 --> 01:41:16.320 align:start position:0%
reluctantly I'm afraid I can't support
 
01:41:20.470 --> 01:41:20.480 align:start position:0%
either 27 or 28 okay representative K
 
01:41:24.550 --> 01:41:24.560 align:start position:0%
thank you Madam chair um I too support
 
01:41:24.560 --> 01:41:25.950 align:start position:0%
thank you Madam chair um I too support
uh

01:41:25.950 --> 01:41:25.960 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:41:30.109 --> 01:41:30.119 align:start position:0%
2027 and the reasons for this is
 
01:41:33.310 --> 01:41:33.320 align:start position:0%
because Dees is coming out with a whole
 
01:41:37.109 --> 01:41:37.119 align:start position:0%
set of rules this year this
 
01:41:39.229 --> 01:41:39.239 align:start position:0%
summer we're going to get to look at
 
01:41:41.470 --> 01:41:41.480 align:start position:0%
them we're going to get to examine
 
01:41:43.790 --> 01:41:43.800 align:start position:0%
them the people that are applying for
 
01:41:46.350 --> 01:41:46.360 align:start position:0%
permits will get to understand what the
 
01:41:49.070 --> 01:41:49.080 align:start position:0%
new guidelines
 
01:41:51.830 --> 01:41:51.840 align:start position:0%
are we'll get to a assess things that
 
01:41:53.350 --> 01:41:53.360 align:start position:0%
we've been talking about in this
 
01:41:58.870 --> 01:41:58.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:03.109 --> 01:42:03.119 align:start position:0%
cycle and the thing is is in
 
01:42:05.950 --> 01:42:05.960 align:start position:0%
2026 if we feel that things aren't going
 
01:42:07.990 --> 01:42:08.000 align:start position:0%
the way they should there can always be
 
01:42:11.030 --> 01:42:11.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:14.470 --> 01:42:14.480 align:start position:0%
in so I believe the
 
01:42:18.109 --> 01:42:18.119 align:start position:0%
2027 would be the best year to put in
 
01:42:22.790 --> 01:42:22.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:25.430 --> 01:42:25.440 align:start position:0%
happening and the rules are
 
01:42:28.270 --> 01:42:28.280 align:start position:0%
changing immensely from what I
 
01:42:30.350 --> 01:42:30.360 align:start position:0%
understand and how sightings are going
 
01:42:31.470 --> 01:42:31.480 align:start position:0%
to be
 
01:42:34.550 --> 01:42:34.560 align:start position:0%
done and I think we need to give Dees a
 
01:42:38.030 --> 01:42:38.040 align:start position:0%
chance also to look at
 
01:42:42.709 --> 01:42:42.719 align:start position:0%
this and understand and other people but
 
01:42:44.950 --> 01:42:44.960 align:start position:0%
if we keep put because now with the new
 
01:42:46.589 --> 01:42:46.599 align:start position:0%
rules we don't know if sighting is going
 
01:42:48.470 --> 01:42:48.480 align:start position:0%
to happen in three years or four years
 
01:42:51.310 --> 01:42:51.320 align:start position:0%
or five years it could take longer we
 
01:42:52.950 --> 01:42:52.960 align:start position:0%
don't know what's going to happen to
 
01:42:56.390 --> 01:42:56.400 align:start position:0%
when the rules come out so I support
 
01:42:58.550 --> 01:42:58.560 align:start position:0%
2027 representative
 
01:43:01.070 --> 01:43:01.080 align:start position:0%
Howard um when we again that bill that
 
01:43:03.470 --> 01:43:03.480 align:start position:0%
failed we um kic we sort of kicked a can
 
01:43:05.709 --> 01:43:05.719 align:start position:0%
down the road with this idea that that
 
01:43:09.350 --> 01:43:09.360 align:start position:0%
DS was Dees was making new rules um and
 
01:43:12.550 --> 01:43:12.560 align:start position:0%
and in the interim between when when we
 
01:43:14.709 --> 01:43:14.719 align:start position:0%
the bill failed and the new rules come
 
01:43:17.550 --> 01:43:17.560 align:start position:0%
out a permit has been put in and I just
 
01:43:19.709 --> 01:43:19.719 align:start position:0%
think that kicking it down the road is
 
01:43:23.109 --> 01:43:23.119 align:start position:0%
is is danger because because there is a
 
01:43:23.119 --> 01:43:23.990 align:start position:0%
is is danger because because there is a
very

01:43:23.990 --> 01:43:24.000 align:start position:0%
very
 
01:43:27.310 --> 01:43:27.320 align:start position:0%
aggressive um pursuit of of
 
01:43:30.149 --> 01:43:30.159 align:start position:0%
sites uh thank you for that and you know
 
01:43:34.270 --> 01:43:34.280 align:start position:0%
I I am also uh wanting to see what
 
01:43:36.709 --> 01:43:36.719 align:start position:0%
happens with this permit that's already
 
01:43:39.030 --> 01:43:39.040 align:start position:0%
being considered because apparently you
 
01:43:41.070 --> 01:43:41.080 align:start position:0%
know we're still waiting to hear from
 
01:43:45.030 --> 01:43:45.040 align:start position:0%
the doj about how any of these new rules
 
01:43:46.990 --> 01:43:47.000 align:start position:0%
or policies are going to affect that
 
01:43:52.830 --> 01:43:52.840 align:start position:0%
permit at all and um I I think we need
 
01:43:54.390 --> 01:43:54.400 align:start position:0%
to have a
 
01:43:59.189 --> 01:43:59.199 align:start position:0%
pause uh to see how that um how that's
 
01:44:04.109 --> 01:44:04.119 align:start position:0%
going to work out so um representative
 
01:44:06.750 --> 01:44:06.760 align:start position:0%
NAB thank you madam chair um I would
 
01:44:07.950 --> 01:44:07.960 align:start position:0%
tend to agree with representative
 
01:44:09.510 --> 01:44:09.520 align:start position:0%
Hoskins you know I like things to be
 
01:44:11.350 --> 01:44:11.360 align:start position:0%
based on fact the fact is we've been
 
01:44:13.270 --> 01:44:13.280 align:start position:0%
told through numerous studies and
 
01:44:14.750 --> 01:44:14.760 align:start position:0%
research that we will not need a new
 
01:44:16.830 --> 01:44:16.840 align:start position:0%
landfill until uh
 
01:44:19.870 --> 01:44:19.880 align:start position:0%
2034 um so I think 2031 was already a
 
01:44:21.709 --> 01:44:21.719 align:start position:0%
compromise at the same time I respect
 
01:44:26.270 --> 01:44:26.280 align:start position:0%
this committee's um desire to be to work
 
01:44:28.149 --> 01:44:28.159 align:start position:0%
together and to compromise and so I'm
 
01:44:30.390 --> 01:44:30.400 align:start position:0%
willing to support the 2028
 
01:44:34.270 --> 01:44:34.280 align:start position:0%
Amendment uh thank you okay representa
 
01:44:37.629 --> 01:44:37.639 align:start position:0%
dsy thank you madam chair uh yeah for
 
01:44:39.229 --> 01:44:39.239 align:start position:0%
every action there's an opposite and
 
01:44:41.669 --> 01:44:41.679 align:start position:0%
equal reaction which I understand is a
 
01:44:46.149 --> 01:44:46.159 align:start position:0%
law of physics so if we put pressure on
 
01:44:50.189 --> 01:44:50.199 align:start position:0%
um uh not putting in new landfills that
 
01:44:52.830 --> 01:44:52.840 align:start position:0%
provides Ides pressure on us for Source
 
01:44:55.189 --> 01:44:55.199 align:start position:0%
reduction and even though we've
 
01:44:57.750 --> 01:44:57.760 align:start position:0%
considered more bills this year for for
 
01:45:00.790 --> 01:45:00.800 align:start position:0%
epr I sense that there's a lot of
 
01:45:03.629 --> 01:45:03.639 align:start position:0%
resistance um on the part of industry
 
01:45:06.510 --> 01:45:06.520 align:start position:0%
and on the part of politicians uh to
 
01:45:08.189 --> 01:45:08.199 align:start position:0%
really move forward with Source
 
01:45:10.709 --> 01:45:10.719 align:start position:0%
reduction which is where we need to be
 
01:45:13.910 --> 01:45:13.920 align:start position:0%
so uh like representative NAB I would
 
01:45:19.990 --> 01:45:20.000 align:start position:0%
like to see um uh 20 uh 31 but in the um
 
01:45:22.750 --> 01:45:22.760 align:start position:0%
uh preference for uh coming to a
 
01:45:24.760 --> 01:45:24.770 align:start position:0%
consensus I could agree to
 
01:45:24.770 --> 01:45:26.030 align:start position:0%
consensus I could agree to
[Music]

01:45:26.030 --> 01:45:26.040 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:45:28.990 --> 01:45:29.000 align:start position:0%
2028 representative H Haskins thank you
 
01:45:31.629 --> 01:45:31.639 align:start position:0%
madam chair I hope I respect
 
01:45:34.270 --> 01:45:34.280 align:start position:0%
collegiality as well as anyone at the
 
01:45:36.669 --> 01:45:36.679 align:start position:0%
table and I would agree with
 
01:45:39.870 --> 01:45:39.880 align:start position:0%
representative Conta if the applicant
 
01:45:41.910 --> 01:45:41.920 align:start position:0%
didn't have a permit that's currently
 
01:45:45.310 --> 01:45:45.320 align:start position:0%
being reviewed at the same time as Dees
 
01:45:48.109 --> 01:45:48.119 align:start position:0%
is writing the rule it never made sense
 
01:45:50.830 --> 01:45:50.840 align:start position:0%
to me I've said this before so the
 
01:45:54.750 --> 01:45:54.760 align:start position:0%
longer we can have this pause Dees can
 
01:45:58.189 --> 01:45:58.199 align:start position:0%
attend itself to the ru making and after
 
01:46:00.910 --> 01:46:00.920 align:start position:0%
that time we can consider whether we
 
01:46:03.070 --> 01:46:03.080 align:start position:0%
need a landfill at
 
01:46:06.589 --> 01:46:06.599 align:start position:0%
all representative Murray um thank you
 
01:46:10.030 --> 01:46:10.040 align:start position:0%
madam chair um I am um also eager to
 
01:46:13.109 --> 01:46:13.119 align:start position:0%
support uh 2028 for actually for the
 
01:46:16.109 --> 01:46:16.119 align:start position:0%
reason that um representative H Haskins
 
01:46:17.790 --> 01:46:17.800 align:start position:0%
actually mentioned it's quite possible
 
01:46:20.669 --> 01:46:20.679 align:start position:0%
that the doj ruling could take some time
 
01:46:24.350 --> 01:46:24.360 align:start position:0%
and um to that end uh you know I want to
 
01:46:28.070 --> 01:46:28.080 align:start position:0%
make sure that we are you know providing
 
01:46:32.030 --> 01:46:32.040 align:start position:0%
a compromise between 2031 and 20 you
 
01:46:34.629 --> 01:46:34.639 align:start position:0%
know 27 I think is is too early I so I
 
01:46:37.109 --> 01:46:37.119 align:start position:0%
would I would prefer to see 2028 in the
 
01:46:39.629 --> 01:46:39.639 align:start position:0%
interest of um you know not being really
 
01:46:42.950 --> 01:46:42.960 align:start position:0%
sure when we would receive an answer
 
01:46:46.830 --> 01:46:46.840 align:start position:0%
okay represent ger thank you madam chair
 
01:46:48.790 --> 01:46:48.800 align:start position:0%
and I also want to be clear that the the
 
01:46:51.430 --> 01:46:51.440 align:start position:0%
original bill was in a sense a
 
01:46:53.390 --> 01:46:53.400 align:start position:0%
compromise because it was 2031 again the
 
01:46:54.870 --> 01:46:54.880 align:start position:0%
three years before we might need
 
01:46:57.589 --> 01:46:57.599 align:start position:0%
capacity it was also a compromise in the
 
01:46:59.390 --> 01:46:59.400 align:start position:0%
sense that it doesn't put a hold on the
 
01:47:02.390 --> 01:47:02.400 align:start position:0%
current permitting process frankly I I
 
01:47:04.709 --> 01:47:04.719 align:start position:0%
think that a moratorium should have a
 
01:47:07.149 --> 01:47:07.159 align:start position:0%
hold on the current permitting process
 
01:47:09.189 --> 01:47:09.199 align:start position:0%
uh precisely because of points that
 
01:47:11.470 --> 01:47:11.480 align:start position:0%
representative has Haskins made uh there
 
01:47:15.229 --> 01:47:15.239 align:start position:0%
is an inherent problem with Dees uh just
 
01:47:17.470 --> 01:47:17.480 align:start position:0%
the process of writing rules while they
 
01:47:20.430 --> 01:47:20.440 align:start position:0%
are currently considering a permit um so
 
01:47:23.070 --> 01:47:23.080 align:start position:0%
so uh the bill is also a compromise in
 
01:47:24.430 --> 01:47:24.440 align:start position:0%
that respect and I would like to
 
01:47:26.430 --> 01:47:26.440 align:start position:0%
personally see it strengthened but again
 
01:47:28.030 --> 01:47:28.040 align:start position:0%
in the spirit of compromise that's not
 
01:47:32.189 --> 01:47:32.199 align:start position:0%
something I'm going to to um to try to
 
01:47:34.830 --> 01:47:34.840 align:start position:0%
introduce into the process at this
 
01:47:38.990 --> 01:47:39.000 align:start position:0%
point it's important when we think about
 
01:47:40.709 --> 01:47:40.719 align:start position:0%
where we might be going with the current
 
01:47:42.189 --> 01:47:42.199 align:start position:0%
draft one of the other things that I'm
 
01:47:45.709 --> 01:47:45.719 align:start position:0%
cognizant of is having only a three days
 
01:47:47.830 --> 01:47:47.840 align:start position:0%
or so to kind of very briefly look at
 
01:47:49.750 --> 01:47:49.760 align:start position:0%
the most recent draft of the dees
 
01:47:51.790 --> 01:47:51.800 align:start position:0%
landfill sightings there's further
 
01:47:54.790 --> 01:47:54.800 align:start position:0%
weakening of Standards based upon even
 
01:47:57.030 --> 01:47:57.040 align:start position:0%
the draft that we had in January which
 
01:47:59.189 --> 01:47:59.199 align:start position:0%
had weakening of Standards from October
 
01:48:00.589 --> 01:48:00.599 align:start position:0%
that does not give me a lot of
 
01:48:02.229 --> 01:48:02.239 align:start position:0%
confidence that we're headed in the
 
01:48:05.229 --> 01:48:05.239 align:start position:0%
right direction um so uh I would
 
01:48:07.109 --> 01:48:07.119 align:start position:0%
actually like to see this stronger I
 
01:48:10.589 --> 01:48:10.599 align:start position:0%
think 2028 is already a real compromise
 
01:48:12.070 --> 01:48:12.080 align:start position:0%
on the part of people who would like a
 
01:48:14.470 --> 01:48:14.480 align:start position:0%
much more robust Bill uh and for those
 
01:48:17.550 --> 01:48:17.560 align:start position:0%
reasons uh I willing to accept 2028 but
 
01:48:19.229 --> 01:48:19.239 align:start position:0%
I will not vote for
 
01:48:25.310 --> 01:48:25.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:27.830 --> 01:48:27.840 align:start position:0%
Penza so I agree with everything that
 
01:48:31.390 --> 01:48:31.400 align:start position:0%
representative ger just said um I think
 
01:48:34.430 --> 01:48:34.440 align:start position:0%
what bothers me the most is on the
 
01:48:37.149 --> 01:48:37.159 align:start position:0%
current permit application that is at
 
01:48:39.750 --> 01:48:39.760 align:start position:0%
Dees it says the earliest that they can
 
01:48:41.070 --> 01:48:41.080 align:start position:0%
open is
 
01:48:44.830 --> 01:48:44.840 align:start position:0%
2028 and there's not a new landfill
 
01:48:48.189 --> 01:48:48.199 align:start position:0%
needed in 2034 let's be clear about all
 
01:48:50.189 --> 01:48:50.199 align:start position:0%
that that is maybe when there could
 
01:48:52.870 --> 01:48:52.880 align:start position:0%
could be a capacity issue which in
 
01:48:55.109 --> 01:48:55.119 align:start position:0%
Rochester they haven't even put a permit
 
01:48:58.790 --> 01:48:58.800 align:start position:0%
in to expand 50 acres so with all of
 
01:49:02.149 --> 01:49:02.159 align:start position:0%
these things I'm all for 2031 I'll I
 
01:49:04.149 --> 01:49:04.159 align:start position:0%
thought we all as a committee decided
 
01:49:08.030 --> 01:49:08.040 align:start position:0%
that we were going to do 2028 um I think
 
01:49:10.070 --> 01:49:10.080 align:start position:0%
something that also bothers me a lot is
 
01:49:12.910 --> 01:49:12.920 align:start position:0%
there's been no action for like 19
 
01:49:16.390 --> 01:49:16.400 align:start position:0%
years and and I thought you know I would
 
01:49:19.070 --> 01:49:19.080 align:start position:0%
have been fine with what it was which
 
01:49:21.390 --> 01:49:21.400 align:start position:0%
was like a six and a half year pause uh
 
01:49:23.669 --> 01:49:23.679 align:start position:0%
because that's what it is and so you
 
01:49:26.030 --> 01:49:26.040 align:start position:0%
know in getting this three and a half
 
01:49:27.910 --> 01:49:27.920 align:start position:0%
year if it's better it's better than
 
01:49:30.550 --> 01:49:30.560 align:start position:0%
nothing I'll I'll go for that but I I I
 
01:49:33.510 --> 01:49:33.520 align:start position:0%
think it should be 2028 and don't look
 
01:49:35.790 --> 01:49:35.800 align:start position:0%
at any don't look at any permits at all
 
01:49:38.310 --> 01:49:38.320 align:start position:0%
focus on you know focus on rewriting the
 
01:49:40.510 --> 01:49:40.520 align:start position:0%
rules and let's and let's make up some
 
01:49:43.070 --> 01:49:43.080 align:start position:0%
for some L time because there's been a
 
01:49:44.390 --> 01:49:44.400 align:start position:0%
there's been a lot of failing that's
 
01:49:47.589 --> 01:49:47.599 align:start position:0%
gone on and uh that's where I'm
 
01:49:50.709 --> 01:49:50.719 align:start position:0%
at okay thank you for that any other
 
01:49:55.149 --> 01:49:55.159 align:start position:0%
comment so in in listening to all this
 
01:49:59.669 --> 01:49:59.679 align:start position:0%
really good um reasoning going
 
01:50:03.750 --> 01:50:03.760 align:start position:0%
on I will in fact be supporting 2028 as
 
01:50:08.149 --> 01:50:08.159 align:start position:0%

01:54:42.149 --> 01:54:42.159 align:start position:0%
important things I think we do
 
01:54:44.310 --> 01:54:44.320 align:start position:0%
is the
 
01:54:48.270 --> 01:54:48.280 align:start position:0%
network uh often you will come up with a
 
01:54:50.870 --> 01:54:50.880 align:start position:0%
an issue here that you have to work and
 
01:54:53.910 --> 01:54:53.920 align:start position:0%

01:57:07.030 --> 01:57:07.040 align:start position:0%

only but there's room okay yes there
 
01:57:14.189 --> 01:57:14.199 align:start position:0%
there is room but the initial one out
 
01:57:17.430 --> 01:57:17.440 align:start position:0%
to people that were appointed or who had
 
01:57:21.510 --> 01:57:21.520 align:start position:0%
been to our educational
 
01:57:24.510 --> 01:57:24.520 align:start position:0%
seminar now the annual meeting I know
 
01:57:26.390 --> 01:57:26.400 align:start position:0%
when we went because we all make made
 
01:57:28.470 --> 01:57:28.480 align:start position:0%
$100 a year which you still do because
 
01:57:32.390 --> 01:57:32.400 align:start position:0%
it's in the Constitution um anyway um
 
01:57:34.470 --> 01:57:34.480 align:start position:0%
that doesn't leave much for actually
 
01:57:36.470 --> 01:57:36.480 align:start position:0%
going to conferences and paying
 
01:57:38.270 --> 01:57:38.280 align:start position:0%
registration fees and transportation and
 
01:57:42.189 --> 01:57:42.199 align:start position:0%
all that stuff um so let us know if you
 
01:57:44.310 --> 01:57:44.320 align:start position:0%
need assistance with that right so get
 
01:57:46.149 --> 01:57:46.159 align:start position:0%
in touch with us I'm gonna pass out my
 
01:57:48.550 --> 01:57:48.560 align:start position:0%
business card so that you see it and and
 
01:57:51.870 --> 01:57:51.880 align:start position:0%
the speaker and Senate President do in
 
01:57:54.310 --> 01:57:54.320 align:start position:0%
fact budget money for people to go to
 
01:57:56.430 --> 01:57:56.440 align:start position:0%
conferences they never tell you about
 
01:58:00.109 --> 01:58:00.119 align:start position:0%
that they they don't tell you and if
 
01:58:02.030 --> 01:58:02.040 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of demand they'll run out
 
01:58:05.830 --> 01:58:05.840 align:start position:0%
of money at some point but uh I only had
 
01:58:08.189 --> 01:58:08.199 align:start position:0%
one time that I was going to a
 
01:58:10.790 --> 01:58:10.800 align:start position:0%
conference and it didn't get paid for
 
01:58:13.510 --> 01:58:13.520 align:start position:0%
right so it's it's a valuable valuable
 
01:58:16.270 --> 01:58:16.280 align:start position:0%
tool that you have to actually get some
 
01:58:18.589 --> 01:58:18.599 align:start position:0%
education out there and it makes a
 
01:58:20.430 --> 01:58:20.440 align:start position:0%
complete difference to your attitude
 
01:58:22.550 --> 01:58:22.560 align:start position:0%
about your work in the house if you see
 
01:58:24.709 --> 01:58:24.719 align:start position:0%
it from a broader perspective it really
 
01:58:28.910 --> 01:58:28.920 align:start position:0%
is quite good and our annual meeting uh
 
01:58:32.229 --> 01:58:32.239 align:start position:0%

um um the parts of the bill that talk
 
02:06:48.750 --> 02:06:48.760 align:start position:0%
about um who should be noticed or who

impact um there was the discussion about
 
02:07:01.830 --> 02:07:01.840 align:start position:0%
20 miles that was an arbitrary number um
 
02:07:03.830 --> 02:07:03.840 align:start position:0%
was it a radius did it include
 
02:07:06.030 --> 02:07:06.040 align:start position:0%
Downstream there were a whole lot of
 
02:07:11.030 --> 02:07:11.040 align:start position:0%
questions about this um this bill um we
 
02:07:14.350 --> 02:07:14.360 align:start position:0%
we all understand though that
 
02:07:17.750 --> 02:07:17.760 align:start position:0%

going to be cited or
 
02:07:38.750 --> 02:07:38.760 align:start position:0%
permitted is something that um we feel
 
02:07:41.390 --> 02:07:41.400 align:start position:0%
that there should be many voices
 
02:07:43.109 --> 02:07:43.119 align:start position:0%
included in the
 
02:07:43.119 --> 02:07:45.109 align:start position:0%

and um I'll just leave it at that and
 
02:07:51.430 --> 02:07:51.440 align:start position:0%
see uh how how people feel about this
 
02:07:51.440 --> 02:07:52.629 align:start position:0%
see uh how how people feel about this
representative

02:07:52.629 --> 02:07:52.639 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:07:55.830 --> 02:07:55.840 align:start position:0%
NAB um thank you madam chair
 
02:07:58.390 --> 02:07:58.400 align:start position:0%
um so a couple of things I do think we
 
02:08:02.870 --> 02:08:02.880 align:start position:0%
needed an amendment to clarify what um
 
02:08:05.629 --> 02:08:05.639 align:start position:0%
what sorry I'm blanking on the word not
 
02:08:08.350 --> 02:08:08.360 align:start position:0%
the groundwater subdivisions but the
 
02:08:11.229 --> 02:08:11.239 align:start position:0%
um there was a map reference that Dees
 
02:08:12.990 --> 02:08:13.000 align:start position:0%
has as to the
 
02:08:15.109 --> 02:08:15.119 align:start position:0%
word I'm totally blanking on the word
 
02:08:17.270 --> 02:08:17.280 align:start position:0%
water shs the water sheds thank you um
 
02:08:18.870 --> 02:08:18.880 align:start position:0%
and I and I agree with thinking a little
 
02:08:21.270 --> 02:08:21.280 align:start position:0%
bit about the 20 M radius um I just
 
02:08:22.870 --> 02:08:22.880 align:start position:0%
wanted to say as someone who sits on a
 
02:08:24.589 --> 02:08:24.599 align:start position:0%
select board and has done Regional
 
02:08:26.470 --> 02:08:26.480 align:start position:0%
notifications that it is something
 
02:08:28.109 --> 02:08:28.119 align:start position:0%
that's really helpful to a town to make
 
02:08:29.510 --> 02:08:29.520 align:start position:0%
something a regional study and to get
 
02:08:31.030 --> 02:08:31.040 align:start position:0%
input from other towns so I just want
 
02:08:32.669 --> 02:08:32.679 align:start position:0%
people to recognize it's not an onerous
 
02:08:34.589 --> 02:08:34.599 align:start position:0%
thing for a town to have to declare
 
02:08:36.910 --> 02:08:36.920 align:start position:0%
something um a development of regional
 
02:08:38.470 --> 02:08:38.480 align:start position:0%
significance because it's very helpful
 
02:08:40.069 --> 02:08:40.079 align:start position:0%
as a town to start getting input from
 
02:08:41.510 --> 02:08:41.520 align:start position:0%
other towns as to the impacts that
 
02:08:43.830 --> 02:08:43.840 align:start position:0%
they're going to see so I I do support
 
02:08:46.109 --> 02:08:46.119 align:start position:0%
this bill um I do think that we could
 
02:08:48.109 --> 02:08:48.119 align:start position:0%
clarify a little bit of the language
 
02:08:50.709 --> 02:08:50.719 align:start position:0%
around what qualifies as a notifying
 
02:08:54.629 --> 02:08:54.639 align:start position:0%
area thanks I do know that in uh line
 
02:08:56.229 --> 02:08:56.239 align:start position:0%
six of this
 
02:08:59.910 --> 02:08:59.920 align:start position:0%
bill there was an incorrect RSA number
 
02:09:02.830 --> 02:09:02.840 align:start position:0%
that was referenced it references 33
 
02:09:02.840 --> 02:09:04.350 align:start position:0%
that was referenced it references 33
colon

02:09:04.350 --> 02:09:04.360 align:start position:0%
colon
 
02:09:07.950 --> 02:09:07.960 align:start position:0%
56 and as I understand from testimony
 
02:09:10.910 --> 02:09:10.920 align:start position:0%
but I think I need to verify it should
 
02:09:13.549 --> 02:09:13.559 align:start position:0%
be 36 colon
 
02:09:17.189 --> 02:09:17.199 align:start position:0%
55 um and that I that's still something
 
02:09:20.910 --> 02:09:20.920 align:start position:0%
I think we need to look look at and
 
02:09:26.669 --> 02:09:26.679 align:start position:0%
um yeah I mean you know I I agree we we
 
02:09:28.950 --> 02:09:28.960 align:start position:0%
I know folks from Dees had mentioned
 
02:09:31.189 --> 02:09:31.199 align:start position:0%
that we need to Define more clearly the
 
02:09:34.350 --> 02:09:34.360 align:start position:0%
extent of the Watershed that we would be
 
02:09:37.149 --> 02:09:37.159 align:start position:0%
talking about and um yeah we did see the
 
02:09:40.470 --> 02:09:40.480 align:start position:0%
map The Watershed map um but some of the
 
02:09:43.270 --> 02:09:43.280 align:start position:0%
watersheds are pretty extensive and I
 
02:09:45.669 --> 02:09:45.679 align:start position:0%
don't know if we want to
 
02:09:49.390 --> 02:09:49.400 align:start position:0%
include that extensive of amount of area
 
02:09:51.870 --> 02:09:51.880 align:start position:0%
in terms of notifications I think that
 
02:09:55.270 --> 02:09:55.280 align:start position:0%
bears some discussion representative
 
02:09:58.629 --> 02:09:58.639 align:start position:0%
kma thank you madam chair um one of the
 
02:10:01.109 --> 02:10:01.119 align:start position:0%
other things was is that the way the
 
02:10:02.790 --> 02:10:02.800 align:start position:0%
bill is written we would have to notify
 
02:10:05.870 --> 02:10:05.880 align:start position:0%
people in other states um and I think
 
02:10:09.950 --> 02:10:09.960 align:start position:0%
that would be honorous on us um I
 
02:10:11.709 --> 02:10:11.719 align:start position:0%
understand there may be an impact to
 
02:10:14.270 --> 02:10:14.280 align:start position:0%
them however what we need to be
 
02:10:16.189 --> 02:10:16.199 align:start position:0%
concerned about when we're doing things
 
02:10:18.790 --> 02:10:18.800 align:start position:0%
is our New Hampshire citizens and I
 
02:10:20.990 --> 02:10:21.000 align:start position:0%
think uh the focus should be on New
 
02:10:23.629 --> 02:10:23.639 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and not the other
 
02:10:26.589 --> 02:10:26.599 align:start position:0%
states okay any other comment
 
02:10:26.599 --> 02:10:27.910 align:start position:0%
states okay any other comment
representative

02:10:27.910 --> 02:10:27.920 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:10:31.870 --> 02:10:31.880 align:start position:0%
viby yeah I think that um this is this
 
02:10:34.870 --> 02:10:34.880 align:start position:0%
would be very valuable to get into place
 
02:10:37.589 --> 02:10:37.599 align:start position:0%
um and I but I agree in terms of needing
 
02:10:40.470 --> 02:10:40.480 align:start position:0%
to put in uh a clearer definition of
 
02:10:43.350 --> 02:10:43.360 align:start position:0%
what the Watershed is uh and I think
 
02:10:46.149 --> 02:10:46.159 align:start position:0%
that that map that was presented uh
 
02:10:49.030 --> 02:10:49.040 align:start position:0%
provides us with a if we can find out
 
02:10:54.069 --> 02:10:54.079 align:start position:0%
what um what RSA that map or or uh is
 
02:10:57.870 --> 02:10:57.880 align:start position:0%
located in or is referenced by then uh
 
02:11:01.310 --> 02:11:01.320 align:start position:0%
have that having that as as part of the
 
02:11:03.830 --> 02:11:03.840 align:start position:0%
um as as part of the definition in the
 
02:11:06.350 --> 02:11:06.360 align:start position:0%
bill I think would be um would be
 
02:11:09.149 --> 02:11:09.159 align:start position:0%
important I also think that you know 20
 
02:11:11.870 --> 02:11:11.880 align:start position:0%
miles is probably excessive I mean from
 
02:11:15.030 --> 02:11:15.040 align:start position:0%
going from TurnKey to Candy I mean my
 
02:11:18.229 --> 02:11:18.239 align:start position:0%
thought I think that's a my my just my
 
02:11:19.750 --> 02:11:19.760 align:start position:0%
geographical sense well is that really
 
02:11:23.229 --> 02:11:23.239 align:start position:0%
only 20 miles but uh at the same time
 
02:11:25.870 --> 02:11:25.880 align:start position:0%
you know it may be as the crow flies
 
02:11:27.109 --> 02:11:27.119 align:start position:0%
because you know you can't drive
 
02:11:29.750 --> 02:11:29.760 align:start position:0%
straight from can't get there from here
 
02:11:34.030 --> 02:11:34.040 align:start position:0%
from Rochester to Candy so um so I I
 
02:11:37.109 --> 02:11:37.119 align:start position:0%
think perhaps uh reducing that to
 
02:11:40.030 --> 02:11:40.040 align:start position:0%
somewhere in the the 10 to 15 mile range
 
02:11:44.629 --> 02:11:44.639 align:start position:0%
might make sense agree uh and uh and I C
 
02:11:46.350 --> 02:11:46.360 align:start position:0%
we can certainly you know make sure that
 
02:11:48.390 --> 02:11:48.400 align:start position:0%
the reference in in paragraph 2 is is
 
02:11:50.790 --> 02:11:50.800 align:start position:0%
correct but uh I think that this is a
 
02:11:52.910 --> 02:11:52.920 align:start position:0%
bill that would not be terribly
 
02:11:58.470 --> 02:11:58.480 align:start position:0%
challenging to uh to amend in time to uh
 
02:12:02.149 --> 02:12:02.159 align:start position:0%
to to execute fairly
 
02:12:06.189 --> 02:12:06.199 align:start position:0%
soon well I know um I guess I also
 
02:12:09.910 --> 02:12:09.920 align:start position:0%
wanted to uh touch on representative K's
 
02:12:12.189 --> 02:12:12.199 align:start position:0%
point about uh do we really need to be
 
02:12:16.149 --> 02:12:16.159 align:start position:0%
notice noticing uh U people in other
 
02:12:19.350 --> 02:12:19.360 align:start position:0%
states and I think that because the
 
02:12:21.709 --> 02:12:21.719 align:start position:0%
issue is that we
 
02:12:26.229 --> 02:12:26.239 align:start position:0%
are looking at uh making you know policy
 
02:12:28.149 --> 02:12:28.159 align:start position:0%
that we're making in the state of New
 
02:12:30.870 --> 02:12:30.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that what's really important
 
02:12:35.830 --> 02:12:35.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:38.589 --> 02:12:38.599 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I agree with those points and
 
02:12:41.950 --> 02:12:41.960 align:start position:0%
I just want to make it um clear that um
 
02:12:45.069 --> 02:12:45.079 align:start position:0%
we would not probably be executing this
 
02:12:47.470 --> 02:12:47.480 align:start position:0%
bill until March 5th because we have
 
02:12:50.790 --> 02:12:50.800 align:start position:0%
school vacation week next week um so we
 
02:12:52.830 --> 02:12:52.840 align:start position:0%
have plenty of time to work on any kind
 
02:12:55.790 --> 02:12:55.800 align:start position:0%
of amendments for bills that we're
 
02:12:58.270 --> 02:12:58.280 align:start position:0%
hearing um that we've already
 
02:13:01.549 --> 02:13:01.559 align:start position:0%
heard um and possibly bills that we're
 
02:13:05.709 --> 02:13:05.719 align:start position:0%
going to hear today or tomorrow so um I
 
02:13:07.589 --> 02:13:07.599 align:start position:0%
just wanted to bring that to everybody's
 
02:13:10.669 --> 02:13:10.679 align:start position:0%
attention that we do have some time um
 
02:13:12.790 --> 02:13:12.800 align:start position:0%
in working on some of these uh bills
 
02:13:15.270 --> 02:13:15.280 align:start position:0%
that are coming before US Representative
 
02:13:17.510 --> 02:13:17.520 align:start position:0%
ger uh thank you madam chair and I just
 
02:13:19.950 --> 02:13:19.960 align:start position:0%
wanted to say as one of the co-sponsors
 
02:13:21.589 --> 02:13:21.599 align:start position:0%
and I worked with the prime sponsor or
 
02:13:23.990 --> 02:13:24.000 align:start position:0%
discussed this with the prime sponsor
 
02:13:25.709 --> 02:13:25.719 align:start position:0%
the point was to kind of get some some
 
02:13:28.270 --> 02:13:28.280 align:start position:0%
basic principles in place uh and I think
 
02:13:29.990 --> 02:13:30.000 align:start position:0%
a lot of the feedback from the committee
 
02:13:32.030 --> 02:13:32.040 align:start position:0%
is makes perfect sense I'd be happy to
 
02:13:35.629 --> 02:13:35.639 align:start position:0%
work on an an amendment uh to help us
 
02:13:38.709 --> 02:13:38.719 align:start position:0%
more closely Define uh our terms and and
 
02:13:40.790 --> 02:13:40.800 align:start position:0%
get a handle on what the appropriate
 
02:13:42.589 --> 02:13:42.599 align:start position:0%
distance would be and how that distance
 
02:13:45.510 --> 02:13:45.520 align:start position:0%
is uh measured but uh I'm I'm glad to to
 
02:13:47.750 --> 02:13:47.760 align:start position:0%
see that there is Broad support for the
 
02:13:49.390 --> 02:13:49.400 align:start position:0%
B basic principles which is what the
 
02:13:51.870 --> 02:13:51.880 align:start position:0%
bill was designed to do so thank
 
02:13:54.629 --> 02:13:54.639 align:start position:0%
you well we always like volunteers to
 
02:13:56.870 --> 02:13:56.880 align:start position:0%
work on
 
02:13:59.149 --> 02:13:59.159 align:start position:0%
amendments anybody else have any
 
02:14:01.910 --> 02:14:01.920 align:start position:0%
comments representative Howard thank you
 
02:14:05.790 --> 02:14:05.800 align:start position:0%
um I I remember I I I'm not sure if I'm
 
02:14:08.109 --> 02:14:08.119 align:start position:0%
remembering correctly but um that when
 
02:14:10.189 --> 02:14:10.199 align:start position:0%
the when Dees was shown that Watershed
 
02:14:12.470 --> 02:14:12.480 align:start position:0%
map they they had some question it was
 
02:14:14.350 --> 02:14:14.360 align:start position:0%
sort of they didn't seem to approve of
 
02:14:17.229 --> 02:14:17.239 align:start position:0%
it or think that it was entirely would
 
02:14:20.629 --> 02:14:20.639 align:start position:0%
serve our purpose is exactly so um I I
 
02:14:23.030 --> 02:14:23.040 align:start position:0%
hope that when we do that if that's not
 
02:14:25.109 --> 02:14:25.119 align:start position:0%
the map that we do track down one that
 
02:14:27.430 --> 02:14:27.440 align:start position:0%
they agree
 
02:14:29.629 --> 02:14:29.639 align:start position:0%
with representative Bixby you had
 
02:14:29.639 --> 02:14:31.189 align:start position:0%
with representative Bixby you had
mentioned

02:14:31.189 --> 02:14:31.199 align:start position:0%
mentioned
 
02:14:34.270 --> 02:14:34.280 align:start position:0%
um the uh Watershed map do you know if
 
02:14:36.589 --> 02:14:36.599 align:start position:0%
it is referenced anywhere in
 
02:14:38.830 --> 02:14:38.840 align:start position:0%
rsas I I don't actually know that you
 
02:14:41.350 --> 02:14:41.360 align:start position:0%
don't know I was just kind of hoping I
 
02:14:43.510 --> 02:14:43.520 align:start position:0%
wonder if our committee researcher can
 
02:14:48.750 --> 02:14:48.760 align:start position:0%
check and see whether the um the that
 
02:14:51.069 --> 02:14:51.079 align:start position:0%
map that Watershed map that Dees
 
02:14:53.270 --> 02:14:53.280 align:start position:0%
provided with us is referenced anywhere
 
02:14:56.990 --> 02:14:57.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:00.470 --> 02:15:00.480 align:start position:0%
rsas okay representative Murray um thank
 
02:15:02.549 --> 02:15:02.559 align:start position:0%
you madam chair um to that end I I would
 
02:15:04.830 --> 02:15:04.840 align:start position:0%
uh also note that on de's website there
 
02:15:08.149 --> 02:15:08.159 align:start position:0%
are several Watershed maps and not just
 
02:15:11.149 --> 02:15:11.159 align:start position:0%
um so there are many Watershed districts
 
02:15:13.189 --> 02:15:13.199 align:start position:0%
so I just wanted to also make folks
 
02:15:15.790 --> 02:15:15.800 align:start position:0%
aware of like there there may be a whole
 
02:15:17.950 --> 02:15:17.960 align:start position:0%
state one but there is also there are
 
02:15:19.950 --> 02:15:19.960 align:start position:0%
also ones that are broken out into
 
02:15:23.549 --> 02:15:23.559 align:start position:0%
regions ah
 
02:15:25.830 --> 02:15:25.840 align:start position:0%
okay uh do we need any kind of
 
02:15:29.830 --> 02:15:29.840 align:start position:0%
clarification from Dees about um those
 
02:15:32.470 --> 02:15:32.480 align:start position:0%
particular maps and how they're used
 
02:15:34.870 --> 02:15:34.880 align:start position:0%
represent Bixby yeah I I think that that
 
02:15:37.350 --> 02:15:37.360 align:start position:0%
would be probably an appropriate job for
 
02:15:42.709 --> 02:15:42.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:45.669 --> 02:15:45.679 align:start position:0%
okay all right
 
02:15:48.750 --> 02:15:48.760 align:start position:0%
um now I do know that there was some
 
02:15:51.510 --> 02:15:51.520 align:start position:0%
testimony that
 
02:15:51.520 --> 02:15:54.950 align:start position:0%
testimony that
said

02:15:54.950 --> 02:15:54.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:57.790 --> 02:15:57.800 align:start position:0%
um there they would be happy if we
 
02:16:01.109 --> 02:16:01.119 align:start position:0%
grandfathered existing and
 
02:16:05.109 --> 02:16:05.119 align:start position:0%
expansions into whatever notification
 
02:16:07.109 --> 02:16:07.119 align:start position:0%
procedures or
 
02:16:10.189 --> 02:16:10.199 align:start position:0%
transparency procedures that we kind of
 
02:16:13.390 --> 02:16:13.400 align:start position:0%
land on um how what are what are our
 
02:16:16.709 --> 02:16:16.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:20.910 --> 02:16:20.920 align:start position:0%
that anyone representative Howard I
 
02:16:23.310 --> 02:16:23.320 align:start position:0%
wonder if expansion isn't the equivalent
 
02:16:26.109 --> 02:16:26.119 align:start position:0%
of a new um a new application kind of
 
02:16:29.109 --> 02:16:29.119 align:start position:0%
thing so that it would require that same
 
02:16:32.150 --> 02:16:32.160 align:start position:0%
sort of alerting the community the the
 
02:16:35.070 --> 02:16:35.080 align:start position:0%
the impact and
 
02:16:38.230 --> 02:16:38.240 align:start position:0%
stuff well I guess you know we
 
02:16:40.709 --> 02:16:40.719 align:start position:0%
already I think I guess the thought is
 
02:16:44.070 --> 02:16:44.080 align:start position:0%
that we already have that
 
02:16:47.790 --> 02:16:47.800 align:start position:0%
those sites in place and in operation
 
02:16:51.669 --> 02:16:51.679 align:start position:0%
and the impacts are already known for
 
02:16:53.629 --> 02:16:53.639 align:start position:0%
those so that I mean that was the
 
02:16:56.270 --> 02:16:56.280 align:start position:0%
argument is that we wouldn't necessarily
 
02:17:01.629 --> 02:17:01.639 align:start position:0%
need to have them um put out any kind of
 
02:17:04.750 --> 02:17:04.760 align:start position:0%
big notification about that I I don't
 
02:17:07.190 --> 02:17:07.200 align:start position:0%
know thoughts represent duy you look
 
02:17:08.670 --> 02:17:08.680 align:start position:0%
like you want to say
 
02:17:08.680 --> 02:17:10.429 align:start position:0%
like you want to say
[Laughter]

02:17:10.429 --> 02:17:10.439 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
02:17:13.190 --> 02:17:13.200 align:start position:0%
something no I I I I was just thinking
 
02:17:15.629 --> 02:17:15.639 align:start position:0%
about the land sight the the land uh
 
02:17:19.150 --> 02:17:19.160 align:start position:0%
fill sites that we have now um I believe
 
02:17:21.509 --> 02:17:21.519 align:start position:0%
I I mean I would agree with you that
 
02:17:24.629 --> 02:17:24.639 align:start position:0%
maybe grandfathering them in because
 
02:17:28.110 --> 02:17:28.120 align:start position:0%
they already are a a site and they are
 
02:17:30.549 --> 02:17:30.559 align:start position:0%
my understanding I mean of course we
 
02:17:32.830 --> 02:17:32.840 align:start position:0%
have a municipal one but I mean you know
 
02:17:35.950 --> 02:17:35.960 align:start position:0%
there is oversight on it in terms of the
 
02:17:38.709 --> 02:17:38.719 align:start position:0%
expansion um I think with with the local
 
02:17:41.750 --> 02:17:41.760 align:start position:0%
boards and and with uh Dees I know they
 
02:17:43.950 --> 02:17:43.960 align:start position:0%
went through a long uh permitting
 
02:17:47.910 --> 02:17:47.920 align:start position:0%
process to open up another part of the
 
02:17:50.910 --> 02:17:50.920 align:start position:0%
of the landfill um so I would be
 
02:17:53.230 --> 02:17:53.240 align:start position:0%
comfortable with grandfathering it in
 
02:17:55.429 --> 02:17:55.439 align:start position:0%
okay good to
 
02:17:55.439 --> 02:17:56.990 align:start position:0%
okay good to
know

02:17:56.990 --> 02:17:57.000 align:start position:0%
know
 
02:17:59.870 --> 02:17:59.880 align:start position:0%
um yeah representative Bixby yeah I
 
02:18:02.230 --> 02:18:02.240 align:start position:0%
actually um I'm not sure that it makes
 
02:18:04.629 --> 02:18:04.639 align:start position:0%
sense to grandfathering expansions
 
02:18:07.190 --> 02:18:07.200 align:start position:0%
because uh essentially this is this is
 
02:18:09.429 --> 02:18:09.439 align:start position:0%
about any permit that is going to have
 
02:18:12.230 --> 02:18:12.240 align:start position:0%
some effect on the surrounding
 
02:18:16.270 --> 02:18:16.280 align:start position:0%
communities and uh and I I think that as
 
02:18:19.469 --> 02:18:19.479 align:start position:0%
as a you know as a resident of do I
 
02:18:22.110 --> 02:18:22.120 align:start position:0%
happen to already be in the notification
 
02:18:27.030 --> 02:18:27.040 align:start position:0%
zone for TurnKey but I I I do want to be
 
02:18:28.629 --> 02:18:28.639 align:start position:0%
in you know if there's an expansion
 
02:18:32.709 --> 02:18:32.719 align:start position:0%
going on uh or if there's a uh at
 
02:18:36.070 --> 02:18:36.080 align:start position:0%
TurnKey I would like uh my constituents
 
02:18:38.629 --> 02:18:38.639 align:start position:0%
to be notified that that's that that's
 
02:18:40.070 --> 02:18:40.080 align:start position:0%
happening and I think that would be also
 
02:18:43.190 --> 02:18:43.200 align:start position:0%
appropriate for and notification does
 
02:18:45.669 --> 02:18:45.679 align:start position:0%
not give anything like veto power it is
 
02:18:47.790 --> 02:18:47.800 align:start position:0%
simply here's this this meting meting is
 
02:18:50.429 --> 02:18:50.439 align:start position:0%
going to happen and so please be aware
 
02:18:52.230 --> 02:18:52.240 align:start position:0%
of it and if you want to come and and
 
02:18:55.309 --> 02:18:55.319 align:start position:0%
comment then please do and that's that's
 
02:18:56.910 --> 02:18:56.920 align:start position:0%
what that's the level of discussion
 
02:18:59.270 --> 02:18:59.280 align:start position:0%
we're talking about right right
 
02:18:59.280 --> 02:19:01.150 align:start position:0%
we're talking about right right
representative

02:19:01.150 --> 02:19:01.160 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:19:04.509 --> 02:19:04.519 align:start position:0%
ktoa thank you madam
 
02:19:07.509 --> 02:19:07.519 align:start position:0%
chair so when we were listening to this
 
02:19:11.669 --> 02:19:11.679 align:start position:0%
apparently and maybe I'm wrong but I
 
02:19:14.669 --> 02:19:14.679 align:start position:0%
understood that notifications are
 
02:19:16.110 --> 02:19:16.120 align:start position:0%
already going out into the major
 
02:19:19.910 --> 02:19:19.920 align:start position:0%
newspapers and in the local papers also
 
02:19:22.070 --> 02:19:22.080 align:start position:0%
so the notification process is already
 
02:19:25.110 --> 02:19:25.120 align:start position:0%
being done um unless we're requiring
 
02:19:27.669 --> 02:19:27.679 align:start position:0%
them to send certified letters to every
 
02:19:30.870 --> 02:19:30.880 align:start position:0%
single residents within that radius I
 
02:19:33.070 --> 02:19:33.080 align:start position:0%
believe that the not notification
 
02:19:36.870 --> 02:19:36.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:40.230 --> 02:19:40.240 align:start position:0%
met okay representative NAB I think they
 
02:19:41.669 --> 02:19:41.679 align:start position:0%
were just speaking to notifying the a
 
02:19:44.190 --> 02:19:44.200 align:start position:0%
Butters not is that that's what they
 
02:19:45.309 --> 02:19:45.319 align:start position:0%
were talking about as notifying a
 
02:19:47.030 --> 02:19:47.040 align:start position:0%
Butters that's done in the newspaper
 
02:19:48.710 --> 02:19:48.720 align:start position:0%
represent have
 
02:19:51.950 --> 02:19:51.960 align:start position:0%
com thank you madam chair but I believe
 
02:19:54.750 --> 02:19:54.760 align:start position:0%
when they are notifying about hearings
 
02:19:57.710 --> 02:19:57.720 align:start position:0%
and maybe Dees could uh answer this
 
02:20:01.110 --> 02:20:01.120 align:start position:0%
question for us um is that they have to
 
02:20:03.870 --> 02:20:03.880 align:start position:0%
put something in the papers uh regarding
 
02:20:06.270 --> 02:20:06.280 align:start position:0%
any of the meetings um could someone
 
02:20:10.070 --> 02:20:10.080 align:start position:0%
from yeah I invite someone from
 
02:20:12.790 --> 02:20:12.800 align:start position:0%
um Michael
 
02:20:15.590 --> 02:20:15.600 align:start position:0%
L yeah hold on one
 
02:20:19.070 --> 02:20:19.080 align:start position:0%
second so could you describe more
 
02:20:22.110 --> 02:20:22.120 align:start position:0%
clearly what exactly is required in
 
02:20:27.190 --> 02:20:27.200 align:start position:0%
terms of notification for uh seeking um
 
02:20:29.830 --> 02:20:29.840 align:start position:0%
new permit for landfill or expansion
 
02:20:31.830 --> 02:20:31.840 align:start position:0%
sure uh thank you for the opportunity my
 
02:20:33.469 --> 02:20:33.479 align:start position:0%
name is Michael norc with the New
 
02:20:35.990 --> 02:20:36.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Dees Solid Waste Management
 
02:20:36.000 --> 02:20:38.150 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Dees Solid Waste Management
Bureau

02:20:38.150 --> 02:20:38.160 align:start position:0%
Bureau
 
02:20:41.150 --> 02:20:41.160 align:start position:0%
um basically uh there's the state
 
02:20:44.469 --> 02:20:44.479 align:start position:0%
process which is governs the permit that
 
02:20:47.309 --> 02:20:47.319 align:start position:0%
the state would issue through Dees and
 
02:20:48.950 --> 02:20:48.960 align:start position:0%
and for that process there is a
 
02:20:52.590 --> 02:20:52.600 align:start position:0%
notification requirement um the
 
02:20:54.870 --> 02:20:54.880 align:start position:0%
applicant would have to notify uh a
 
02:20:57.110 --> 02:20:57.120 align:start position:0%
Butters so property owners that are
 
02:21:02.110 --> 02:21:02.120 align:start position:0%
abutting the uh proposed landfill parcel
 
02:21:03.950 --> 02:21:03.960 align:start position:0%
how did I do that with certified letter
 
02:21:06.389 --> 02:21:06.399 align:start position:0%
do they yeah yeah so using certified
 
02:21:08.070 --> 02:21:08.080 align:start position:0%
letters they need to have a return
 
02:21:10.710 --> 02:21:10.720 align:start position:0%
receipt uh confirming that the uh
 
02:21:12.790 --> 02:21:12.800 align:start position:0%
abutter had received the notification
 
02:21:13.830 --> 02:21:13.840 align:start position:0%
and they include that in their
 
02:21:15.070 --> 02:21:15.080 align:start position:0%
application to
 
02:21:20.070 --> 02:21:20.080 align:start position:0%
Dees um they also have to to uh put uh
 
02:21:22.630 --> 02:21:22.640 align:start position:0%
notification in a in a public newspaper
 
02:21:23.870 --> 02:21:23.880 align:start position:0%
of General
 
02:21:28.150 --> 02:21:28.160 align:start position:0%
circulation um that would uh you know
 
02:21:29.870 --> 02:21:29.880 align:start position:0%
kind of cover folks that aren't
 
02:21:32.870 --> 02:21:32.880 align:start position:0%
necessarily abutters but uh are in the
 
02:21:34.870 --> 02:21:34.880 align:start position:0%
general area that might be interested to
 
02:21:36.830 --> 02:21:36.840 align:start position:0%
to learn of the application and the
 
02:21:38.870 --> 02:21:38.880 align:start position:0%
opportunity for public hearing because
 
02:21:42.510 --> 02:21:42.520 align:start position:0%
as Dees uh as part of our process for
 
02:21:45.309 --> 02:21:45.319 align:start position:0%
issuing a permit for a landfill hearings
 
02:21:48.190 --> 02:21:48.200 align:start position:0%
are a requirement um so so there is an
 
02:21:50.190 --> 02:21:50.200 align:start position:0%
opportunity for the general public to
 
02:21:52.590 --> 02:21:52.600 align:start position:0%
attend those hearings and and offer
 
02:21:52.600 --> 02:21:54.750 align:start position:0%
attend those hearings and and offer
input

02:21:54.750 --> 02:21:54.760 align:start position:0%
input
 
02:21:57.110 --> 02:21:57.120 align:start position:0%
um I think those are the two main
 
02:21:59.429 --> 02:21:59.439 align:start position:0%
requirements governing the state
 
02:22:01.790 --> 02:22:01.800 align:start position:0%
permitting process but just to clarify
 
02:22:02.870 --> 02:22:02.880 align:start position:0%
again I think I mentioned this in the
 
02:22:07.349 --> 02:22:07.359 align:start position:0%
hearing this bill is governing the local
 
02:22:10.030 --> 02:22:10.040 align:start position:0%
approval uh and the so the the local
 
02:22:12.830 --> 02:22:12.840 align:start position:0%
land use board or planning board uh
 
02:22:15.510 --> 02:22:15.520 align:start position:0%
would have a hearing for an application
 
02:22:16.910 --> 02:22:16.920 align:start position:0%
that they Reed potentially for the same
 
02:22:19.150 --> 02:22:19.160 align:start position:0%
project but it again would be for that
 
02:22:22.950 --> 02:22:22.960 align:start position:0%
local uh approval process um so I think
 
02:22:27.309 --> 02:22:27.319 align:start position:0%
the the the uh intention here was to
 
02:22:30.230 --> 02:22:30.240 align:start position:0%
allow for input into that local planning
 
02:22:32.150 --> 02:22:32.160 align:start position:0%
process from broader communities that
 
02:22:34.190 --> 02:22:34.200 align:start position:0%
might be affected to allow them to
 
02:22:35.790 --> 02:22:35.800 align:start position:0%
participate in the hearing that the
 
02:22:38.270 --> 02:22:38.280 align:start position:0%
local land use board might
 
02:22:41.349 --> 02:22:41.359 align:start position:0%
have yeah representative kto thank you
 
02:22:44.790 --> 02:22:44.800 align:start position:0%
madam chair um now if they're already
 
02:22:44.800 --> 02:22:45.950 align:start position:0%
madam chair um now if they're already
putting

02:22:45.950 --> 02:22:45.960 align:start position:0%
putting
 
02:22:50.030 --> 02:22:50.040 align:start position:0%
in the the notice and they're notifying
 
02:22:52.110 --> 02:22:52.120 align:start position:0%
the abuts so anyone from any of the
 
02:22:53.950 --> 02:22:53.960 align:start position:0%
towns could already come to those
 
02:22:57.389 --> 02:22:57.399 align:start position:0%
hearings or those local boards and
 
02:23:00.070 --> 02:23:00.080 align:start position:0%
express their concerns is that correct
 
02:23:02.030 --> 02:23:02.040 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I'm not sure if I'm following
 
02:23:03.389 --> 02:23:03.399 align:start position:0%
what you're asking are you asking about
 
02:23:05.870 --> 02:23:05.880 align:start position:0%
the state permitting process no um you
 
02:23:09.349 --> 02:23:09.359 align:start position:0%
said that the permittee had to also put
 
02:23:11.030 --> 02:23:11.040 align:start position:0%
something about hearings and their
 
02:23:13.110 --> 02:23:13.120 align:start position:0%
intent to do something in the paper and
 
02:23:15.389 --> 02:23:15.399 align:start position:0%
hold a public hearing is that correct
 
02:23:17.870 --> 02:23:17.880 align:start position:0%
that that when I was describing the the
 
02:23:20.590 --> 02:23:20.600 align:start position:0%
new the newspaper notification that was
 
02:23:22.790 --> 02:23:22.800 align:start position:0%
uh a requirement of our rules relative
 
02:23:24.190 --> 02:23:24.200 align:start position:0%
to the permitting process so an
 
02:23:26.269 --> 02:23:26.279 align:start position:0%
applicant for State permit for a
 
02:23:28.710 --> 02:23:28.720 align:start position:0%
landfill has to publish a notification
 
02:23:30.550 --> 02:23:30.560 align:start position:0%
in the in the general you know
 
02:23:31.870 --> 02:23:31.880 align:start position:0%
circulation so it could be the union
 
02:23:36.230 --> 02:23:36.240 align:start position:0%
leader could be uh SE Coast uh whatever
 
02:23:38.389 --> 02:23:38.399 align:start position:0%
the paper might be but that would be
 
02:23:41.269 --> 02:23:41.279 align:start position:0%
notification of the hearing for d d
 
02:23:43.630 --> 02:23:43.640 align:start position:0%
basically Dees the that the hearing that
 
02:23:46.750 --> 02:23:46.760 align:start position:0%
we host for a permit application for the
 
02:23:48.550 --> 02:23:48.560 align:start position:0%
state permit I don't I don't know if
 
02:23:49.830 --> 02:23:49.840 align:start position:0%
that ansers your question but I'm trying
 
02:23:51.950 --> 02:23:51.960 align:start position:0%
to just clarify there's a dichotomy here
 
02:23:54.670 --> 02:23:54.680 align:start position:0%
represent muray thank you madam chair I
 
02:23:57.230 --> 02:23:57.240 align:start position:0%
also um to representative bixby's Point
 
02:23:59.510 --> 02:23:59.520 align:start position:0%
um just something I've been chewing on
 
02:24:02.750 --> 02:24:02.760 align:start position:0%
is around um vertical expansion within a
 
02:24:04.590 --> 02:24:04.600 align:start position:0%
footprint versus horizontal or
 
02:24:07.269 --> 02:24:07.279 align:start position:0%
circumferential expansion and so that's
 
02:24:09.550 --> 02:24:09.560 align:start position:0%
just something I've been thinking about
 
02:24:13.429 --> 02:24:13.439 align:start position:0%
um and to to representative bi spe Point
 
02:24:14.910 --> 02:24:14.920 align:start position:0%
whether or not that should be um
 
02:24:17.230 --> 02:24:17.240 align:start position:0%
grandfathered or not so I just want to
 
02:24:18.630 --> 02:24:18.640 align:start position:0%
make that
 
02:24:20.630 --> 02:24:20.640 align:start position:0%
mention that's something we should
 
02:24:23.670 --> 02:24:23.680 align:start position:0%
consider you know representative H
 
02:24:26.510 --> 02:24:26.520 align:start position:0%
Haskins thank you madam chair um and
 
02:24:28.750 --> 02:24:28.760 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question I'm
 
02:24:31.870 --> 02:24:31.880 align:start position:0%
trying to follow what happens when the
 
02:24:35.830 --> 02:24:35.840 align:start position:0%
public comes to comment so you host a
 
02:24:37.790 --> 02:24:37.800 align:start position:0%
meeting you
 
02:24:41.110 --> 02:24:41.120 align:start position:0%
said correct we host a meeting uh or a
 
02:24:42.830 --> 02:24:42.840 align:start position:0%
hearing rather
 
02:24:45.750 --> 02:24:45.760 align:start position:0%
for input onto the state permitting
 
02:24:47.469 --> 02:24:47.479 align:start position:0%
process which is different than what
 
02:24:50.630 --> 02:24:50.640 align:start position:0%
this bill is about just because you
 
02:24:53.030 --> 02:24:53.040 align:start position:0%
brought that up I'm curious what happens
 
02:24:55.030 --> 02:24:55.040 align:start position:0%
to that public
 
02:24:57.469 --> 02:24:57.479 align:start position:0%
comment is it part of the permanent
 
02:24:59.150 --> 02:24:59.160 align:start position:0%
record does
 
02:25:03.670 --> 02:25:03.680 align:start position:0%
it yes factor into your consideration of
 
02:25:05.910 --> 02:25:05.920 align:start position:0%
the permit yeah we are required to take
 
02:25:09.349 --> 02:25:09.359 align:start position:0%
comments at a public hearing um those
 
02:25:10.670 --> 02:25:10.680 align:start position:0%
comments do become part of the public
 
02:25:12.670 --> 02:25:12.680 align:start position:0%
record and they are kind
 
02:25:15.630 --> 02:25:15.640 align:start position:0%
of part of the record that we retain
 
02:25:17.990 --> 02:25:18.000 align:start position:0%
relative to the application process for
 
02:25:23.510 --> 02:25:23.520 align:start position:0%
that permit um typically Dees will also
 
02:25:25.150 --> 02:25:25.160 align:start position:0%
take written comments after the public
 
02:25:26.590 --> 02:25:26.600 align:start position:0%
hearing so we'll have a certain period
 
02:25:28.469 --> 02:25:28.479 align:start position:0%
of time where we allow interested
 
02:25:30.309 --> 02:25:30.319 align:start position:0%
parties to write their comments and
 
02:25:33.309 --> 02:25:33.319 align:start position:0%
submit them to Dees um and we usually
 
02:25:35.510 --> 02:25:35.520 align:start position:0%
compile all of those written comments
 
02:25:39.349 --> 02:25:39.359 align:start position:0%
into one kind of repository or or a
 
02:25:42.550 --> 02:25:42.560 align:start position:0%
record uh and then we issue usually we
 
02:25:44.870 --> 02:25:44.880 align:start position:0%
issue a response to the comments that we
 
02:25:47.510 --> 02:25:47.520 align:start position:0%
received notifying folks of and we we
 
02:25:49.230 --> 02:25:49.240 align:start position:0%
won't respond to each individual comment
 
02:25:50.670 --> 02:25:50.680 align:start position:0%
but we'll usually try to group them
 
02:25:53.030 --> 02:25:53.040 align:start position:0%
together just for efficiency to cover
 
02:25:55.710 --> 02:25:55.720 align:start position:0%
the main themes of folks concerns and if
 
02:25:57.230 --> 02:25:57.240 align:start position:0%
there are concerns that were raised that
 
02:25:58.990 --> 02:25:59.000 align:start position:0%
aren't necessarily within our purview we
 
02:26:01.309 --> 02:26:01.319 align:start position:0%
will note that um but if there are
 
02:26:03.190 --> 02:26:03.200 align:start position:0%
concerns that are within our prview we
 
02:26:06.070 --> 02:26:06.080 align:start position:0%
will um definitely consider that in the
 
02:26:08.429 --> 02:26:08.439 align:start position:0%
decision- making and the uh issuance of
 
02:26:11.190 --> 02:26:11.200 align:start position:0%
a permit or denial of a permit thank you
 
02:26:13.110 --> 02:26:13.120 align:start position:0%
okay representing Bixby and then I'll
 
02:26:17.469 --> 02:26:17.479 align:start position:0%
get to you yeah so um so just to to make
 
02:26:20.230 --> 02:26:20.240 align:start position:0%
it a little bit clearer what we're doing
 
02:26:21.790 --> 02:26:21.800 align:start position:0%
with this bill and what we hope to do
 
02:26:25.469 --> 02:26:25.479 align:start position:0%
with the bill um so this is let I'm just
 
02:26:27.750 --> 02:26:27.760 align:start position:0%
going to use an example let's say that
 
02:26:31.510 --> 02:26:31.520 align:start position:0%
there is uh some project that is
 
02:26:33.950 --> 02:26:33.960 align:start position:0%
happening at the turnkey landfill in
 
02:26:39.429 --> 02:26:39.439 align:start position:0%
Rochester that uh the uh land use board
 
02:26:43.550 --> 02:26:43.560 align:start position:0%
in Rochester wants to have some uh
 
02:26:47.670 --> 02:26:47.680 align:start position:0%
control over because TurnKey is in land
 
02:26:49.309 --> 02:26:49.319 align:start position:0%
is in Rochester
 
02:26:55.790 --> 02:26:55.800 align:start position:0%
currently uh I I believe that uh that
 
02:26:59.110 --> 02:26:59.120 align:start position:0%
people that uh a notice would go out to
 
02:27:00.510 --> 02:27:00.520 align:start position:0%
uh public notice would go out in
 
02:27:02.349 --> 02:27:02.359 align:start position:0%
Rochester the way that they publicly
 
02:27:05.990 --> 02:27:06.000 align:start position:0%
noticed their meetings for uh Rochester
 
02:27:07.750 --> 02:27:07.760 align:start position:0%
residents and I believe that they would
 
02:27:07.760 --> 02:27:08.870 align:start position:0%
residents and I believe that they would
also

02:27:08.870 --> 02:27:08.880 align:start position:0%
also
 
02:27:11.710 --> 02:27:11.720 align:start position:0%
because uh Dober and barington are right
 
02:27:15.950 --> 02:27:15.960 align:start position:0%
next door that the uh that that notice
 
02:27:21.110 --> 02:27:21.120 align:start position:0%
would be sent to the um do Dover City
 
02:27:23.309 --> 02:27:23.319 align:start position:0%
management and to the barington town
 
02:27:25.550 --> 02:27:25.560 align:start position:0%
management who who would then be able to
 
02:27:29.269 --> 02:27:29.279 align:start position:0%
notice it to their um to their residents
 
02:27:32.469 --> 02:27:32.479 align:start position:0%
but that notice would not go to Madbury
 
02:27:35.070 --> 02:27:35.080 align:start position:0%
because it is not right next to
 
02:27:38.070 --> 02:27:38.080 align:start position:0%
Rochester uh but it is in the Watershed
 
02:27:43.790 --> 02:27:43.800 align:start position:0%
so um so under this bill uh the notice
 
02:27:46.030 --> 02:27:46.040 align:start position:0%
would also go to the town of Madbury and
 
02:27:50.750 --> 02:27:50.760 align:start position:0%
to the town of of um uh and and to other
 
02:27:52.670 --> 02:27:52.680 align:start position:0%
other towns that are in that water in
 
02:27:54.990 --> 02:27:55.000 align:start position:0%
the Watershed and I I don't have a
 
02:27:57.190 --> 02:27:57.200 align:start position:0%
watershed map in my head and probably
 
02:28:00.469 --> 02:28:00.479 align:start position:0%
the town of R the town of Rollinsford uh
 
02:28:03.830 --> 02:28:03.840 align:start position:0%
so that uh and then those towns would
 
02:28:06.309 --> 02:28:06.319 align:start position:0%
then uh provide notice to their
 
02:28:08.190 --> 02:28:08.200 align:start position:0%
residents so it wouldn't be it wouldn't
 
02:28:11.429 --> 02:28:11.439 align:start position:0%
be like you know TurnKey would have to
 
02:28:14.349 --> 02:28:14.359 align:start position:0%
give a certified male you know return
 
02:28:18.550 --> 02:28:18.560 align:start position:0%
mail re uh to to every resident of every
 
02:28:20.750 --> 02:28:20.760 align:start position:0%
town in in in the in the surrounding
 
02:28:23.150 --> 02:28:23.160 align:start position:0%
area it would be that the town
 
02:28:25.469 --> 02:28:25.479 align:start position:0%
governments would be notified and then
 
02:28:27.950 --> 02:28:27.960 align:start position:0%
they would notify their their cons their
 
02:28:29.990 --> 02:28:30.000 align:start position:0%
residents in the way that they usually
 
02:28:32.269 --> 02:28:32.279 align:start position:0%
notify about
 
02:28:36.830 --> 02:28:36.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:42.110 --> 02:28:42.120 align:start position:0%
Penza so in Rochester with TurnKey um
 
02:28:45.230 --> 02:28:45.240 align:start position:0%
most people they they really don't know
 
02:28:47.870 --> 02:28:47.880 align:start position:0%
what's going on it's just like that so
 
02:28:49.469 --> 02:28:49.479 align:start position:0%
you know this is a total separate thing
 
02:28:51.469 --> 02:28:51.479 align:start position:0%
than what the state does with permit and
 
02:28:53.830 --> 02:28:53.840 align:start position:0%
all that
 
02:28:57.309 --> 02:28:57.319 align:start position:0%
um I like this bill for a lot of reasons
 
02:28:59.630 --> 02:28:59.640 align:start position:0%
just because better communication is
 
02:29:02.790 --> 02:29:02.800 align:start position:0%
better than no communication and so
 
02:29:05.830 --> 02:29:05.840 align:start position:0%
right now in Rochester you have you have
 
02:29:08.990 --> 02:29:09.000 align:start position:0%
one paper which is The Fosters but you
 
02:29:11.870 --> 02:29:11.880 align:start position:0%
have to pay and most people don't pay
 
02:29:15.910 --> 02:29:15.920 align:start position:0%
for that it's an online paper and so um
 
02:29:18.030 --> 02:29:18.040 align:start position:0%
and it's it's cutting out a whole
 
02:29:19.710 --> 02:29:19.720 align:start position:0%
percentage of people that don't read
 
02:29:22.429 --> 02:29:22.439 align:start position:0%
their newspaper online and then the
 
02:29:24.830 --> 02:29:24.840 align:start position:0%
other one is Rochester voice which
 
02:29:28.230 --> 02:29:28.240 align:start position:0%
doesn't have a lot of visibility so I
 
02:29:31.590 --> 02:29:31.600 align:start position:0%
would love there to be um you know
 
02:29:34.469 --> 02:29:34.479 align:start position:0%
public notice that could be put to um
 
02:29:36.230 --> 02:29:36.240 align:start position:0%
Boards of Selectmen and and city
 
02:29:38.910 --> 02:29:38.920 align:start position:0%
councilors in in their town halls in our
 
02:29:42.269 --> 02:29:42.279 align:start position:0%
city Halls you get do and summersworth
 
02:29:46.670 --> 02:29:46.680 align:start position:0%
and in Rochester of course um you've got
 
02:29:48.510 --> 02:29:48.520 align:start position:0%
very close about Butters Bearington that
 
02:29:50.830 --> 02:29:50.840 align:start position:0%
are right there so you know I think the
 
02:29:53.710 --> 02:29:53.720 align:start position:0%
more people that um are able to kind of
 
02:29:55.750 --> 02:29:55.760 align:start position:0%
know what's going on I was at a meeting
 
02:29:58.630 --> 02:29:58.640 align:start position:0%
for example uh last Saturday and uh we
 
02:30:01.070 --> 02:30:01.080 align:start position:0%
spent 20 minutes and uh they started
 
02:30:04.110 --> 02:30:04.120 align:start position:0%
talking about the landfill well I'm like
 
02:30:05.910 --> 02:30:05.920 align:start position:0%
lo and behold I'm on environment and
 
02:30:07.750 --> 02:30:07.760 align:start position:0%
agriculture so I know some stuff about
 
02:30:11.110 --> 02:30:11.120 align:start position:0%
this but if I wasn't they you know and
 
02:30:12.910 --> 02:30:12.920 align:start position:0%
and of course there's P people that are
 
02:30:14.590 --> 02:30:14.600 align:start position:0%
very close to where the landfill is
 
02:30:15.870 --> 02:30:15.880 align:start position:0%
asking about what's going on with the
 
02:30:18.030 --> 02:30:18.040 align:start position:0%
smell and all that kind of stuff it
 
02:30:20.110 --> 02:30:20.120 align:start position:0%
would be so wonderful cuz Waste
 
02:30:21.990 --> 02:30:22.000 align:start position:0%
Management's been really good I mean
 
02:30:24.469 --> 02:30:24.479 align:start position:0%
they're working very hard on a on a
 
02:30:27.990 --> 02:30:28.000 align:start position:0%
really huge problem that we're facing
 
02:30:29.790 --> 02:30:29.800 align:start position:0%
but because people don't have the
 
02:30:32.309 --> 02:30:32.319 align:start position:0%
information they're pretty angry they're
 
02:30:35.349 --> 02:30:35.359 align:start position:0%
like what's going on what's going on so
 
02:30:37.110 --> 02:30:37.120 align:start position:0%
you know even if it was like the union
 
02:30:39.630 --> 02:30:39.640 align:start position:0%
leader you know that's not necessarily
 
02:30:42.030 --> 02:30:42.040 align:start position:0%
something that going through a paper
 
02:30:43.910 --> 02:30:43.920 align:start position:0%
that they're going to get so I don't
 
02:30:46.830 --> 02:30:46.840 align:start position:0%
know what the best possible way to to
 
02:30:50.990 --> 02:30:51.000 align:start position:0%
get information out to um folks you know
 
02:30:53.429 --> 02:30:53.439 align:start position:0%
more than just a Butters but it's I
 
02:30:56.150 --> 02:30:56.160 align:start position:0%
don't know this this this is just
 
02:30:58.550 --> 02:30:58.560 align:start position:0%
another another way we can try to to
 
02:31:00.870 --> 02:31:00.880 align:start position:0%
handle it but I'm sure you hear this
 
02:31:04.510 --> 02:31:04.520 align:start position:0%
stuff all the time right don't you about
 
02:31:06.389 --> 02:31:06.399 align:start position:0%
notifications and people not getting
 
02:31:07.950 --> 02:31:07.960 align:start position:0%
that kind of information no no I didn't
 
02:31:09.830 --> 02:31:09.840 align:start position:0%
know there was a public
 
02:31:12.309 --> 02:31:12.319 align:start position:0%
hearing um yeah I mean there's there's
 
02:31:15.990 --> 02:31:16.000 align:start position:0%
always we could always you know do other
 
02:31:17.670 --> 02:31:17.680 align:start position:0%
things try to reach people in fact thees
 
02:31:19.030 --> 02:31:19.040 align:start position:0%
goes over and above and tries to post it
 
02:31:20.910 --> 02:31:20.920 align:start position:0%
on our social media we try to post it on
 
02:31:22.830 --> 02:31:22.840 align:start position:0%
our website so there are things that we
 
02:31:24.469 --> 02:31:24.479 align:start position:0%
do that are over and above our
 
02:31:26.510 --> 02:31:26.520 align:start position:0%
requirements just to try to cover the
 
02:31:27.630 --> 02:31:27.640 align:start position:0%
situations you're talking about where
 
02:31:29.630 --> 02:31:29.640 align:start position:0%
folks may not be reading the newspaper
 
02:31:31.790 --> 02:31:31.800 align:start position:0%
or uh really paying attention to some of
 
02:31:33.750 --> 02:31:33.760 align:start position:0%
these other venues where information is
 
02:31:37.269 --> 02:31:37.279 align:start position:0%
being circulated so um yeah we do we do
 
02:31:38.750 --> 02:31:38.760 align:start position:0%
try to to get the information out as
 
02:31:41.670 --> 02:31:41.680 align:start position:0%
best we can and we thank you for
 
02:31:44.670 --> 02:31:44.680 align:start position:0%
that y representative H Haskins just a
 
02:31:46.830 --> 02:31:46.840 align:start position:0%
quick question is the applicant required
 
02:31:48.910 --> 02:31:48.920 align:start position:0%
to come to these
 
02:31:51.230 --> 02:31:51.240 align:start position:0%
meetings yes
 
02:31:55.550 --> 02:31:55.560 align:start position:0%
um I because I was that wasn't always
 
02:31:55.560 --> 02:31:56.309 align:start position:0%
um I because I was that wasn't always
the

02:31:56.309 --> 02:31:56.319 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:31:59.510 --> 02:31:59.520 align:start position:0%
case Okay um I I can't say for certain
 
02:32:01.870 --> 02:32:01.880 align:start position:0%
that there's a requirement in our rules
 
02:32:04.389 --> 02:32:04.399 align:start position:0%
uh that's not again this is not my area
 
02:32:05.990 --> 02:32:06.000 align:start position:0%
of specialty but in terms of the
 
02:32:08.750 --> 02:32:08.760 align:start position:0%
permitting of a facility um and the
 
02:32:12.110 --> 02:32:12.120 align:start position:0%
process thereof but as far as I know
 
02:32:14.870 --> 02:32:14.880 align:start position:0%
every permitted uh landfill in the state
 
02:32:16.710 --> 02:32:16.720 align:start position:0%
that we've had re you know issues
 
02:32:19.750 --> 02:32:19.760 align:start position:0%
expansions or or permits for the permit
 
02:32:23.269 --> 02:32:23.279 align:start position:0%
or uh somebody representing the permit
 
02:32:25.429 --> 02:32:25.439 align:start position:0%
has been there to present at those
 
02:32:25.439 --> 02:32:26.269 align:start position:0%
has been there to present at those
public

02:32:26.269 --> 02:32:26.279 align:start position:0%
public
 
02:32:29.510 --> 02:32:29.520 align:start position:0%
hearings okay representa Murray thank
 
02:32:31.389 --> 02:32:31.399 align:start position:0%
you madam chair I think um going back to
 
02:32:33.469 --> 02:32:33.479 align:start position:0%
my point I I wonder if it is fruitful
 
02:32:35.469 --> 02:32:35.479 align:start position:0%
for whoever is working on an amendment
 
02:32:37.790 --> 02:32:37.800 align:start position:0%
to consider perhaps working with the
 
02:32:39.910 --> 02:32:39.920 align:start position:0%
department and identifying first how
 
02:32:41.990 --> 02:32:42.000 align:start position:0%
many um Watershed districts there are
 
02:32:44.429 --> 02:32:44.439 align:start position:0%
and if you know how many there are off
 
02:32:46.870 --> 02:32:46.880 align:start position:0%
hand right now that's helpful but if not
 
02:32:50.429 --> 02:32:50.439 align:start position:0%
um aligning that sort of notification
 
02:32:53.910 --> 02:32:53.920 align:start position:0%
like representative Bixby was suggesting
 
02:32:56.030 --> 02:32:56.040 align:start position:0%
perhaps to New Hampshire Watershed
 
02:32:59.309 --> 02:32:59.319 align:start position:0%
districts not necessarily uh I'm I'm
 
02:33:00.710 --> 02:33:00.720 align:start position:0%
wondering if that's a
 
02:33:04.190 --> 02:33:04.200 align:start position:0%
fruitful discussion represent vix yeah
 
02:33:06.309 --> 02:33:06.319 align:start position:0%
um I'm noticing the clock and we've been
 
02:33:08.990 --> 02:33:09.000 align:start position:0%
talking about this one for about half an
 
02:33:12.150 --> 02:33:12.160 align:start position:0%
hour and we have a couple more to go Y
 
02:33:14.190 --> 02:33:14.200 align:start position:0%
and I believe that repres representative
 
02:33:16.389 --> 02:33:16.399 align:start position:0%
gerana said he would be willing to work
 
02:33:18.790 --> 02:33:18.800 align:start position:0%
on an amendment okay so I think maybe we
 
02:33:20.469 --> 02:33:20.479 align:start position:0%
should hand this over to his capable
 
02:33:26.910 --> 02:33:26.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:29.870 --> 02:33:29.880 align:start position:0%
concur thank you thank you Mr norc
 
02:33:31.550 --> 02:33:31.560 align:start position:0%
appreciate your
 
02:33:34.910 --> 02:33:34.920 align:start position:0%
time okay um so then we can move along
 
02:33:37.670 --> 02:33:37.680 align:start position:0%
to HB 1145 prohibiting the private
 
02:33:38.870 --> 02:33:38.880 align:start position:0%
ownership of
 
02:33:41.230 --> 02:33:41.240 align:start position:0%
landfills and I think that kind of goes
 
02:33:44.630 --> 02:33:44.640 align:start position:0%
in hand inand with hb1 1632 relative to
 
02:33:48.950 --> 02:33:48.960 align:start position:0%
out ofate solid waste one seeks to um
 
02:33:53.070 --> 02:33:53.080 align:start position:0%
well they both seek to um reduce the
 
02:33:55.670 --> 02:33:55.680 align:start position:0%
amount of outstate
 
02:33:58.710 --> 02:33:58.720 align:start position:0%
trash uh being deposited into our
 
02:33:58.720 --> 02:34:00.590 align:start position:0%
trash uh being deposited into our
landfills

02:34:00.590 --> 02:34:00.600 align:start position:0%
landfills
 
02:34:03.590 --> 02:34:03.600 align:start position:0%
um and they're kind of both seeking a
 
02:34:06.830 --> 02:34:06.840 align:start position:0%
way around the Commerce Clause of the
 
02:34:08.830 --> 02:34:08.840 align:start position:0%
Constitution US
 
02:34:13.550 --> 02:34:13.560 align:start position:0%
Constitution um so I'd like to invite
 
02:34:17.910 --> 02:34:17.920 align:start position:0%
discussion about um 11 45 and see maybe
 
02:34:22.309 --> 02:34:22.319 align:start position:0%
that will kind of dovetail into hp1 1632
 
02:34:24.750 --> 02:34:24.760 align:start position:0%
as well representative
 
02:34:29.269 --> 02:34:29.279 align:start position:0%
ger thank you madam chair I I support in
 
02:34:31.349 --> 02:34:31.359 align:start position:0%
in the end I don't think these bills
 
02:34:33.469 --> 02:34:33.479 align:start position:0%
have to conflict uh with each other I
 
02:34:35.790 --> 02:34:35.800 align:start position:0%
think they as The Madam chair points out
 
02:34:37.510 --> 02:34:37.520 align:start position:0%
we're there are two different ways of
 
02:34:40.910 --> 02:34:40.920 align:start position:0%
trying to get at the underlying problem
 
02:34:44.349 --> 02:34:44.359 align:start position:0%
um I think we can all agree there's been
 
02:34:46.630 --> 02:34:46.640 align:start position:0%
a lot of of press coverage of of the
 
02:34:48.870 --> 02:34:48.880 align:start position:0%
fact that we take about you know 50% of
 
02:34:50.590 --> 02:34:50.600 align:start position:0%
what's it's a little less than that in
 
02:34:53.309 --> 02:34:53.319 align:start position:0%
the last report but between 45 and 50%
 
02:34:54.630 --> 02:34:54.640 align:start position:0%
of what we put in our landfills comes
 
02:34:56.590 --> 02:34:56.600 align:start position:0%
from out of state and I think that our
 
02:34:58.230 --> 02:34:58.240 align:start position:0%
constituents across the state have made
 
02:34:59.950 --> 02:34:59.960 align:start position:0%
it very clear that that's not acceptable
 
02:35:02.110 --> 02:35:02.120 align:start position:0%
so then the question is what's the best
 
02:35:05.349 --> 02:35:05.359 align:start position:0%
remedy for that
 
02:35:08.630 --> 02:35:08.640 align:start position:0%
1145 uh I see the particular virtue of
 
02:35:09.910 --> 02:35:09.920 align:start position:0%
public owned
 
02:35:12.110 --> 02:35:12.120 align:start position:0%
landfills uh and I understand there were
 
02:35:13.710 --> 02:35:13.720 align:start position:0%
a lot of really good questions that came
 
02:35:16.510 --> 02:35:16.520 align:start position:0%
up in the in the hearing is that allows
 
02:35:20.269 --> 02:35:20.279 align:start position:0%
us to do three things simultaneously
 
02:35:22.910 --> 02:35:22.920 align:start position:0%
right one is to cap the amount of out
 
02:35:25.110 --> 02:35:25.120 align:start position:0%
ofate waste that we take but the other
 
02:35:27.110 --> 02:35:27.120 align:start position:0%
two things it allows us to do which I
 
02:35:28.990 --> 02:35:29.000 align:start position:0%
think are important number one it allows
 
02:35:31.150 --> 02:35:31.160 align:start position:0%
us to discriminate with regard to the
 
02:35:34.950 --> 02:35:34.960 align:start position:0%
kinds of waste we take from out of state
 
02:35:38.830 --> 02:35:38.840 align:start position:0%
if it's a privately owned landfill uh
 
02:35:40.510 --> 02:35:40.520 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
02:35:42.710 --> 02:35:42.720 align:start position:0%
1632 doesn't address that right we could
 
02:35:45.630 --> 02:35:45.640 align:start position:0%
take 15% out of state waste but we are
 
02:35:47.870 --> 02:35:47.880 align:start position:0%
still taking mattresses and rugs and
 
02:35:50.750 --> 02:35:50.760 align:start position:0%
other past Laden uh materials now
 
02:35:52.469 --> 02:35:52.479 align:start position:0%
fortunately we would be taking less of
 
02:35:54.710 --> 02:35:54.720 align:start position:0%
it because we're capping it but uh if
 
02:35:58.269 --> 02:35:58.279 align:start position:0%
it's a publicly owned landfill then we
 
02:35:59.830 --> 02:35:59.840 align:start position:0%
can say there are certain things that
 
02:36:02.550 --> 02:36:02.560 align:start position:0%
we're simply not going to take uh and
 
02:36:04.870 --> 02:36:04.880 align:start position:0%
then the other virtue I think of
 
02:36:07.590 --> 02:36:07.600 align:start position:0%
1145 is that it allows us to charge
 
02:36:10.710 --> 02:36:10.720 align:start position:0%
differential rates between trash we take
 
02:36:15.990 --> 02:36:16.000 align:start position:0%
from out of state and uh and and um what
 
02:36:17.870 --> 02:36:17.880 align:start position:0%
people pay in in New Hampshire to
 
02:36:19.230 --> 02:36:19.240 align:start position:0%
dispose of their waste and I think
 
02:36:21.910 --> 02:36:21.920 align:start position:0%
that's important because I understand as
 
02:36:25.110 --> 02:36:25.120 align:start position:0%
as some members brought up that you are
 
02:36:28.230 --> 02:36:28.240 align:start position:0%
the reality is that uh folks who are in
 
02:36:30.550 --> 02:36:30.560 align:start position:0%
this business are going to be making
 
02:36:34.349 --> 02:36:34.359 align:start position:0%
less profits because of less outof State
 
02:36:36.950 --> 02:36:36.960 align:start position:0%
waste coming in the ability to charge
 
02:36:39.110 --> 02:36:39.120 align:start position:0%
more for outof State waste is going to
 
02:36:41.790 --> 02:36:41.800 align:start position:0%
offset some of that uh there's no way to
 
02:36:43.950 --> 02:36:43.960 align:start position:0%
get around the fact that if we reduce
 
02:36:45.550 --> 02:36:45.560 align:start position:0%
the amount of outstate waste that we are
 
02:36:47.670 --> 02:36:47.680 align:start position:0%
bringing in that that is going to have
 
02:36:49.630 --> 02:36:49.640 align:start position:0%
an impact on the folks that are that are
 
02:36:51.910 --> 02:36:51.920 align:start position:0%
in that business but the the companies
 
02:36:53.950 --> 02:36:53.960 align:start position:0%
who work in this field work in lots of
 
02:36:55.750 --> 02:36:55.760 align:start position:0%
different states with lots of different
 
02:36:57.950 --> 02:36:57.960 align:start position:0%
conditions some of which actually almost
 
02:36:59.750 --> 02:36:59.760 align:start position:0%
all of which are more are stricter than
 
02:37:01.750 --> 02:37:01.760 align:start position:0%
ours so these are not conditions that
 
02:37:03.910 --> 02:37:03.920 align:start position:0%
they're unfamiliar with these are not
 
02:37:05.269 --> 02:37:05.279 align:start position:0%
conditions that their business models
 
02:37:08.830 --> 02:37:08.840 align:start position:0%
are not designed to uh to work with and
 
02:37:10.510 --> 02:37:10.520 align:start position:0%
our first priority is to our
 
02:37:12.630 --> 02:37:12.640 align:start position:0%
constituents and that is to reduce that
 
02:37:16.870 --> 02:37:16.880 align:start position:0%
waste but allowing for a different rate
 
02:37:18.630 --> 02:37:18.640 align:start position:0%
to be charged to out ofate waste there
 
02:37:20.790 --> 02:37:20.800 align:start position:0%
is at least the opportunity to offset
 
02:37:23.710 --> 02:37:23.720 align:start position:0%
some of the revenue that they are law
 
02:37:26.150 --> 02:37:26.160 align:start position:0%
that they are losing if we cap out of
 
02:37:28.110 --> 02:37:28.120 align:start position:0%
state waste so I mean I'd be fine in the
 
02:37:30.990 --> 02:37:31.000 align:start position:0%
end if we if we did
 
02:37:34.590 --> 02:37:34.600 align:start position:0%
1632 uh but I I think that 1145 actually
 
02:37:37.469 --> 02:37:37.479 align:start position:0%
gives us more bang for our buck uh and
 
02:37:41.870 --> 02:37:41.880 align:start position:0%
is more uh does more for the people of
 
02:37:41.880 --> 02:37:42.550 align:start position:0%
is more uh does more for the people of
the

02:37:42.550 --> 02:37:42.560 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:37:44.389 --> 02:37:44.399 align:start position:0%
state thank
 
02:37:46.349 --> 02:37:46.359 align:start position:0%
you represent
 
02:37:51.110 --> 02:37:51.120 align:start position:0%
Bixby so so um a couple of things uh
 
02:37:56.429 --> 02:37:56.439 align:start position:0%
about um 1145 one one is that uh the
 
02:37:58.670 --> 02:37:58.680 align:start position:0%
topic in the came up in the hearing of
 
02:38:00.870 --> 02:38:00.880 align:start position:0%
would it be possible to use eminent do
 
02:38:05.190 --> 02:38:05.200 align:start position:0%
domain to uh for the state to purchase
 
02:38:08.870 --> 02:38:08.880 align:start position:0%
land uh and I'm not sure what the
 
02:38:10.670 --> 02:38:10.680 align:start position:0%
current eminent domain restrictions are
 
02:38:12.030 --> 02:38:12.040 align:start position:0%
I know that they are tighter than they
 
02:38:14.030 --> 02:38:14.040 align:start position:0%
used to be because I voted for a bill
 
02:38:15.990 --> 02:38:16.000 align:start position:0%
that tightened them but I don't remember
 
02:38:18.510 --> 02:38:18.520 align:start position:0%
the details but I I would be happy to
 
02:38:20.830 --> 02:38:20.840 align:start position:0%
put an amendment on this bill saying
 
02:38:24.030 --> 02:38:24.040 align:start position:0%
that uh eminent domain shall not be used
 
02:38:26.630 --> 02:38:26.640 align:start position:0%
to acquire land for a state-owned
 
02:38:32.190 --> 02:38:32.200 align:start position:0%
landfill uh and the other thing is that
 
02:38:35.750 --> 02:38:35.760 align:start position:0%
um one of the things we don't know is
 
02:38:37.429 --> 02:38:37.439 align:start position:0%
how these bills are going to be received
 
02:38:39.510 --> 02:38:39.520 align:start position:0%
by the Senate and which one it's
 
02:38:41.590 --> 02:38:41.600 align:start position:0%
possible the Senate might prefer one to
 
02:38:45.990 --> 02:38:46.000 align:start position:0%
the other uh we can't uh make that uh
 
02:38:48.150 --> 02:38:48.160 align:start position:0%
determination in advance I think we want
 
02:38:52.429 --> 02:38:52.439 align:start position:0%
to give them uh both of the both options
 
02:38:56.830 --> 02:38:56.840 align:start position:0%
so that uh they can uh continue our work
 
02:38:59.910 --> 02:38:59.920 align:start position:0%
on trying to reduce out ofate waste I
 
02:39:03.030 --> 02:39:03.040 align:start position:0%
think that and I what I care most about
 
02:39:04.750 --> 02:39:04.760 align:start position:0%
is reducing out ofate waste I want to
 
02:39:06.950 --> 02:39:06.960 align:start position:0%
make sure that we have as many Avenues
 
02:39:11.830 --> 02:39:11.840 align:start position:0%
to to make that happen as
 
02:39:15.030 --> 02:39:15.040 align:start position:0%
possible okay uh you know for me with
 
02:39:19.590 --> 02:39:19.600 align:start position:0%
this first of all I'm just I'm just so
 
02:39:22.309 --> 02:39:22.319 align:start position:0%
um it's such an anathema to me to
 
02:39:24.630 --> 02:39:24.640 align:start position:0%
prohibit private ownership of anything I
 
02:39:27.510 --> 02:39:27.520 align:start position:0%
just just off the top of my head but and
 
02:39:30.349 --> 02:39:30.359 align:start position:0%
I get it um you know being able to
 
02:39:34.070 --> 02:39:34.080 align:start position:0%
control better what is being put into
 
02:39:37.389 --> 02:39:37.399 align:start position:0%
our landfills and so that's that's a
 
02:39:38.870 --> 02:39:38.880 align:start position:0%
positive for
 
02:39:42.550 --> 02:39:42.560 align:start position:0%
me um I but I also wonder if we're
 
02:39:44.469 --> 02:39:44.479 align:start position:0%
creating a conflict of
 
02:39:46.790 --> 02:39:46.800 align:start position:0%
interest that that we still have to
 
02:39:48.790 --> 02:39:48.800 align:start position:0%
permit the state still has to
 
02:39:51.950 --> 02:39:51.960 align:start position:0%
permit this land to be used as a
 
02:39:54.870 --> 02:39:54.880 align:start position:0%
landfill and go through the whole um
 
02:39:56.910 --> 02:39:56.920 align:start position:0%
permitting process I would imagine and
 
02:40:00.429 --> 02:40:00.439 align:start position:0%
so it just seems weird to me a possible
 
02:40:02.510 --> 02:40:02.520 align:start position:0%
conflict of interest that the state is
 
02:40:06.230 --> 02:40:06.240 align:start position:0%
permitting itself to use this land so
 
02:40:08.190 --> 02:40:08.200 align:start position:0%
what do you what's your thoughts on that
 
02:40:10.510 --> 02:40:10.520 align:start position:0%
we have other examples of things that
 
02:40:14.790 --> 02:40:14.800 align:start position:0%
the state owns and hires a company to
 
02:40:17.590 --> 02:40:17.600 align:start position:0%
operate yeah so uh for instance Mount
 
02:40:22.389 --> 02:40:22.399 align:start position:0%
sunap I there are Opera there are in law
 
02:40:24.750 --> 02:40:24.760 align:start position:0%
uh a number of things that constrain the
 
02:40:27.950 --> 02:40:27.960 align:start position:0%
way that a ski resort can be operated
 
02:40:30.190 --> 02:40:30.200 align:start position:0%
and they there are certain safety
 
02:40:35.190 --> 02:40:35.200 align:start position:0%
requirements Etc that are state laws and
 
02:40:37.510 --> 02:40:37.520 align:start position:0%
it doesn't matter whether it is Cannon
 
02:40:43.030 --> 02:40:43.040 align:start position:0%
Mountain or uh Mount sopy or uh or
 
02:40:46.469 --> 02:40:46.479 align:start position:0%
Gunstock or uh for for the publicly
 
02:40:52.190 --> 02:40:52.200 align:start position:0%
owned ones or uh you cran Moore or Lon
 
02:40:56.710 --> 02:40:56.720 align:start position:0%
or um they all have to follow laws
 
02:41:00.469 --> 02:41:00.479 align:start position:0%
having to do with how ski resorts are
 
02:41:00.479 --> 02:41:02.389 align:start position:0%
having to do with how ski resorts are
run

02:41:02.389 --> 02:41:02.399 align:start position:0%
run
 
02:41:04.830 --> 02:41:04.840 align:start position:0%
and just begs the question though does
 
02:41:07.070 --> 02:41:07.080 align:start position:0%
the state do a good job doing
 
02:41:08.950 --> 02:41:08.960 align:start position:0%
it I don't
 
02:41:11.190 --> 02:41:11.200 align:start position:0%
know U representative
 
02:41:13.990 --> 02:41:14.000 align:start position:0%
kulan H yeah thank you madam chair like
 
02:41:16.030 --> 02:41:16.040 align:start position:0%
I can respect what you guys are trying
 
02:41:18.990 --> 02:41:19.000 align:start position:0%
to do I think I understand the intent
 
02:41:21.950 --> 02:41:21.960 align:start position:0%
but I believe when you publicize costs
 
02:41:24.230 --> 02:41:24.240 align:start position:0%
and then privatize profits that's the
 
02:41:27.469 --> 02:41:27.479 align:start position:0%
definition of corporate welfare actually
 
02:41:31.110 --> 02:41:31.120 align:start position:0%
and so I agree with the cutting down on
 
02:41:33.389 --> 02:41:33.399 align:start position:0%
the out ofate waste part but I just
 
02:41:36.349 --> 02:41:36.359 align:start position:0%
think this kind of I get the idea but I
 
02:41:38.269 --> 02:41:38.279 align:start position:0%
think it is actually just corporate
 
02:41:43.230 --> 02:41:43.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:47.230 --> 02:41:47.240 align:start position:0%
Penza sorry that perplexes me I have to
 
02:41:48.950 --> 02:41:48.960 align:start position:0%
I want you to explain that more because
 
02:41:50.550 --> 02:41:50.560 align:start position:0%
I want to understand the corporate
 
02:41:53.710 --> 02:41:53.720 align:start position:0%
welfare piece but I think this is just
 
02:41:57.590 --> 02:41:57.600 align:start position:0%
as simple as the state having skin in
 
02:42:00.110 --> 02:42:00.120 align:start position:0%
the game I believe that they've needed
 
02:42:03.030 --> 02:42:03.040 align:start position:0%
skin in the game for a long time we just
 
02:42:06.070 --> 02:42:06.080 align:start position:0%
got an email I think this morning that
 
02:42:07.910 --> 02:42:07.920 align:start position:0%
is on a
 
02:42:11.429 --> 02:42:11.439 align:start position:0%
report from a current active
 
02:42:15.429 --> 02:42:15.439 align:start position:0%
landfill company that says any such life
 
02:42:18.110 --> 02:42:18.120 align:start position:0%
liability is likely to be uninsurable
 
02:42:20.910 --> 02:42:20.920 align:start position:0%
with no coverage likely under our
 
02:42:23.510 --> 02:42:23.520 align:start position:0%
pollution or product liability policies
 
02:42:27.750 --> 02:42:27.760 align:start position:0%
this is for in regards with like P and
 
02:42:29.910 --> 02:42:29.920 align:start position:0%
they they just
 
02:42:33.030 --> 02:42:33.040 align:start position:0%
said such liability is likely to be
 
02:42:36.389 --> 02:42:36.399 align:start position:0%
uninsurable so once that landfill closes
 
02:42:39.030 --> 02:42:39.040 align:start position:0%
we are on the hook for that I just I
 
02:42:43.910 --> 02:42:43.920 align:start position:0%
don't understand right now in in we've
 
02:42:45.670 --> 02:42:45.680 align:start position:0%
got super fun sites all over over New
 
02:42:49.670 --> 02:42:49.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so I think this public private
 
02:42:52.750 --> 02:42:52.760 align:start position:0%
partnership is I think it's I just think
 
02:42:56.710 --> 02:42:56.720 align:start position:0%
it's the way um it gives us it gives us
 
02:43:00.790 --> 02:43:00.800 align:start position:0%
that piece of of involvement that we
 
02:43:05.630 --> 02:43:05.640 align:start position:0%
need um and and as well as just handing
 
02:43:08.150 --> 02:43:08.160 align:start position:0%
it off to someone else everything's
 
02:43:10.389 --> 02:43:10.399 align:start position:0%
handed off right now all of the
 
02:43:13.230 --> 02:43:13.240 align:start position:0%
reporting comes directly from the
 
02:43:15.550 --> 02:43:15.560 align:start position:0%
industry they hired the you know they
 
02:43:17.429 --> 02:43:17.439 align:start position:0%
hired the contractors to do it they have
 
02:43:20.309 --> 02:43:20.319 align:start position:0%
all of that and we're not and it's
 
02:43:22.590 --> 02:43:22.600 align:start position:0%
wonderful in a sense but we've got to
 
02:43:26.950 --> 02:43:26.960 align:start position:0%
trust but verify and I I just I think
 
02:43:30.269 --> 02:43:30.279 align:start position:0%
that uh I think this is a great bill and
 
02:43:32.190 --> 02:43:32.200 align:start position:0%
if it you know if it needs a little bit
 
02:43:34.070 --> 02:43:34.080 align:start position:0%
of work cleaning up and stuff like that
 
02:43:37.429 --> 02:43:37.439 align:start position:0%
then you know it's understandable but I
 
02:43:39.309 --> 02:43:39.319 align:start position:0%
think it's time for the state to to
 
02:43:41.590 --> 02:43:41.600 align:start position:0%
truly be involved in this process and
 
02:43:44.269 --> 02:43:44.279 align:start position:0%
not just handed it off representative
 
02:43:44.279 --> 02:43:46.710 align:start position:0%
not just handed it off representative
smart

02:43:46.710 --> 02:43:46.720 align:start position:0%
smart
 
02:43:49.230 --> 02:43:49.240 align:start position:0%
okay um I don't have the bill in front
 
02:43:51.429 --> 02:43:51.439 align:start position:0%
of me but I know the bill we're talking
 
02:43:52.990 --> 02:43:53.000 align:start position:0%
about and I also don't have emails in
 
02:43:53.870 --> 02:43:53.880 align:start position:0%
front of
 
02:43:56.750 --> 02:43:56.760 align:start position:0%
me I have a problem with the state
 
02:44:00.389 --> 02:44:00.399 align:start position:0%
owning property um taking having our
 
02:44:03.990 --> 02:44:04.000 align:start position:0%
landfills be state-owned I know from
 
02:44:07.830 --> 02:44:07.840 align:start position:0%
experience that if there's a problem
 
02:44:10.870 --> 02:44:10.880 align:start position:0%
your so you can't do anything about it
 
02:44:12.710 --> 02:44:12.720 align:start position:0%
because they're bigger than we are and I
 
02:44:14.349 --> 02:44:14.359 align:start position:0%
don't know how they got bigger than we
 
02:44:16.590 --> 02:44:16.600 align:start position:0%
are because we're the people we have a
 
02:44:20.230 --> 02:44:20.240 align:start position:0%
voice but the government I mean the
 
02:44:23.190 --> 02:44:23.200 align:start position:0%
state has more power and and they're
 
02:44:25.870 --> 02:44:25.880 align:start position:0%
telling us they don't have money to fund
 
02:44:27.910 --> 02:44:27.920 align:start position:0%
other projects but they have money to
 
02:44:31.190 --> 02:44:31.200 align:start position:0%
buy this buy land and make it into a
 
02:44:34.469 --> 02:44:34.479 align:start position:0%
landfill how come I don't I don't get it
 
02:44:36.630 --> 02:44:36.640 align:start position:0%
I I guess I'm not getting a lot of it
 
02:44:39.550 --> 02:44:39.560 align:start position:0%
but it's not sitting well represent H
 
02:44:42.990 --> 02:44:43.000 align:start position:0%
Haskins thank you madam chair we have a
 
02:44:43.000 --> 02:44:44.150 align:start position:0%
Haskins thank you madam chair we have a
trash

02:44:44.150 --> 02:44:44.160 align:start position:0%
trash
 
02:44:48.550 --> 02:44:48.560 align:start position:0%
problem and local control is very
 
02:44:52.429 --> 02:44:52.439 align:start position:0%
important to a lot of people at this
 
02:44:56.830 --> 02:44:56.840 align:start position:0%
table the um issues that I have learned
 
02:44:59.990 --> 02:45:00.000 align:start position:0%
about since sitting on this committee
 
02:45:04.230 --> 02:45:04.240 align:start position:0%
suggest to me that the vermont-based
 
02:45:07.910 --> 02:45:07.920 align:start position:0%
company doesn't care what we put in our
 
02:45:12.309 --> 02:45:12.319 align:start position:0%
landfill doesn't care you know they need
 
02:45:15.910 --> 02:45:15.920 align:start position:0%
to make a profit I get that um
 
02:45:18.309 --> 02:45:18.319 align:start position:0%
I think skin in the game is absolutely
 
02:45:21.710 --> 02:45:21.720 align:start position:0%
what this is about I think that we have
 
02:45:21.720 --> 02:45:23.110 align:start position:0%
what this is about I think that we have
heard

02:45:23.110 --> 02:45:23.120 align:start position:0%
heard
 
02:45:25.710 --> 02:45:25.720 align:start position:0%
testimony that our
 
02:45:29.870 --> 02:45:29.880 align:start position:0%
constituents want a voice and they don't
 
02:45:31.429 --> 02:45:31.439 align:start position:0%
feel like they're being
 
02:45:35.070 --> 02:45:35.080 align:start position:0%
heard um so I think this gives us
 
02:45:38.870 --> 02:45:38.880 align:start position:0%
another opportunity to have some
 
02:45:41.230 --> 02:45:41.240 align:start position:0%
oversight and the company's going to
 
02:45:43.910 --> 02:45:43.920 align:start position:0%
make plenty of money um that's not a
 
02:45:47.710 --> 02:45:47.720 align:start position:0%
problem um um I'm reminded that
 
02:45:50.030 --> 02:45:50.040 align:start position:0%
representative Duty takes us back to the
 
02:45:50.040 --> 02:45:51.070 align:start position:0%
representative Duty takes us back to the
idea

02:45:51.070 --> 02:45:51.080 align:start position:0%
idea
 
02:45:55.429 --> 02:45:55.439 align:start position:0%
that overall we want to reduce the stuff
 
02:45:57.950 --> 02:45:57.960 align:start position:0%
that's going into the landfills so I
 
02:46:00.389 --> 02:46:00.399 align:start position:0%
think these bills are getting closer to
 
02:46:02.990 --> 02:46:03.000 align:start position:0%
being able to do that and provide an
 
02:46:05.269 --> 02:46:05.279 align:start position:0%
incentive and I like this bill and I
 
02:46:07.790 --> 02:46:07.800 align:start position:0%
hope we'll support
 
02:46:10.910 --> 02:46:10.920 align:start position:0%
it uh yeah representative Howard thank
 
02:46:15.550 --> 02:46:15.560 align:start position:0%
you and then ger um so when the Bia was
 
02:46:17.510 --> 02:46:17.520 align:start position:0%
the representative was talking to us she
 
02:46:21.349 --> 02:46:21.359 align:start position:0%
she said that um Bill elf um
 
02:46:23.950 --> 02:46:23.960 align:start position:0%
1145 represented a lost business
 
02:46:26.349 --> 02:46:26.359 align:start position:0%
opportunity but I what I wanted what I
 
02:46:28.070 --> 02:46:28.080 align:start position:0%
wish I had asked her is are all business
 
02:46:30.790 --> 02:46:30.800 align:start position:0%
opportunities equal so I think that that
 
02:46:34.389 --> 02:46:34.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:37.150 --> 02:46:37.160 align:start position:0%
in well I'll you know I'll tell you that
 
02:46:43.990 --> 02:46:44.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:44.000 --> 02:46:45.950 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:46:45.950 --> 02:46:45.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:46:47.710 --> 02:46:47.720 align:start position:0%
it that it that it would harm business
 
02:46:49.389 --> 02:46:49.399 align:start position:0%
because business would still be running
 
02:46:51.790 --> 02:46:51.800 align:start position:0%
the landfill but I I'm I'm not so sure
 
02:46:55.230 --> 02:46:55.240 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm I want the state to get into the
 
02:46:58.870 --> 02:46:58.880 align:start position:0%
trash business I don't know but anyway I
 
02:47:01.750 --> 02:47:01.760 align:start position:0%
I I still have to really think about a
 
02:47:04.990 --> 02:47:05.000 align:start position:0%
lot of what's what's been put before us
 
02:47:08.870 --> 02:47:08.880 align:start position:0%
I mean I do like um HP
 
02:47:12.830 --> 02:47:12.840 align:start position:0%
1632 in that it puts
 
02:47:15.550 --> 02:47:15.560 align:start position:0%
a a percent
 
02:47:18.309 --> 02:47:18.319 align:start position:0%
of uh Solid Waste transported from out
 
02:47:21.030 --> 02:47:21.040 align:start position:0%
of state and that has a measure of
 
02:47:23.910 --> 02:47:23.920 align:start position:0%
control without having the state
 
02:47:26.349 --> 02:47:26.359 align:start position:0%
actually purchase land and get involved
 
02:47:29.269 --> 02:47:29.279 align:start position:0%
with with uh having a contractor run it
 
02:47:32.870 --> 02:47:32.880 align:start position:0%
and do whatever it's it's a more
 
02:47:37.630 --> 02:47:37.640 align:start position:0%
simple uh solution to the issue of um of
 
02:47:39.750 --> 02:47:39.760 align:start position:0%
of limiting the amount of at ofate Solid
 
02:47:43.030 --> 02:47:43.040 align:start position:0%
Waste coming to us um anyway
 
02:47:45.510 --> 02:47:45.520 align:start position:0%
representative gerana I'm rambling on no
 
02:47:48.110 --> 02:47:48.120 align:start position:0%
no no I think it's important
 
02:47:50.710 --> 02:47:50.720 align:start position:0%
to for us to think through these things
 
02:47:51.670 --> 02:47:51.680 align:start position:0%
together because that's what we're all
 
02:47:53.710 --> 02:47:53.720 align:start position:0%
doing so I appreciate that what Madam
 
02:47:55.389 --> 02:47:55.399 align:start position:0%
chair was just saying I want to point
 
02:47:57.269 --> 02:47:57.279 align:start position:0%
out two things one is when we talk about
 
02:48:00.150 --> 02:48:00.160 align:start position:0%
this in in terms of the business of of
 
02:48:01.590 --> 02:48:01.600 align:start position:0%
kind a landfilling it's important to
 
02:48:03.230 --> 02:48:03.240 align:start position:0%
recognize that this is not a business
 
02:48:05.429 --> 02:48:05.439 align:start position:0%
like other businesses right the very
 
02:48:07.349 --> 02:48:07.359 align:start position:0%
nature of it legally is different from
 
02:48:09.910 --> 02:48:09.920 align:start position:0%
other businesses they are required to
 
02:48:12.550 --> 02:48:12.560 align:start position:0%
serve a public need they are required to
 
02:48:15.070 --> 02:48:15.080 align:start position:0%
demonstrate that there is both that need
 
02:48:17.510 --> 02:48:17.520 align:start position:0%
and and a public benefit uh and there
 
02:48:19.670 --> 02:48:19.680 align:start position:0%
are reasons for that because even if a
 
02:48:21.830 --> 02:48:21.840 align:start position:0%
private company owns that land obviously
 
02:48:23.429 --> 02:48:23.439 align:start position:0%
you're talking about the air you're
 
02:48:25.269 --> 02:48:25.279 align:start position:0%
talking about water that may be affected
 
02:48:26.469 --> 02:48:26.479 align:start position:0%
because of the operation of that
 
02:48:30.830 --> 02:48:30.840 align:start position:0%
business so it is unique or or unlike
 
02:48:32.830 --> 02:48:32.840 align:start position:0%
most other businesses because by its
 
02:48:34.590 --> 02:48:34.600 align:start position:0%
very nature it has to be a public
 
02:48:37.590 --> 02:48:37.600 align:start position:0%
private Enterprise because of the the
 
02:48:39.349 --> 02:48:39.359 align:start position:0%
resources that belong to all of us that
 
02:48:41.550 --> 02:48:41.560 align:start position:0%
are involved by its very nature in this
 
02:48:44.830 --> 02:48:44.840 align:start position:0%
business and as I'm willing to go out
 
02:48:47.269 --> 02:48:47.279 align:start position:0%
out kind of on a limb and say I don't
 
02:48:49.870 --> 02:48:49.880 align:start position:0%
think it's much of a limb but um I
 
02:48:51.309 --> 02:48:51.319 align:start position:0%
thought about this during the hearing
 
02:48:52.950 --> 02:48:52.960 align:start position:0%
there is the cost how much would this
 
02:48:54.590 --> 02:48:54.600 align:start position:0%
cost we we're talking about several
 
02:48:57.510 --> 02:48:57.520 align:start position:0%
years down the road capacity need is
 
02:48:59.110 --> 02:48:59.120 align:start position:0%
something we're going to see coming it's
 
02:49:01.030 --> 02:49:01.040 align:start position:0%
not going to catch us by surprise right
 
02:49:02.429 --> 02:49:02.439 align:start position:0%
we're not going to all of a sudden
 
02:49:03.870 --> 02:49:03.880 align:start position:0%
decide this has to be done tomorrow
 
02:49:06.710 --> 02:49:06.720 align:start position:0%
we'll have time to see this coming uh I
 
02:49:09.070 --> 02:49:09.080 align:start position:0%
am willing to absolutely bet that if we
 
02:49:10.750 --> 02:49:10.760 align:start position:0%
asked our
 
02:49:12.630 --> 02:49:12.640 align:start position:0%
constituents this is how much it's going
 
02:49:13.950 --> 02:49:13.960 align:start position:0%
to cost for the state to buy the
 
02:49:15.630 --> 02:49:15.640 align:start position:0%
landfill and to make sure that it's
 
02:49:18.269 --> 02:49:18.279 align:start position:0%
suitable for placing a landfill and this
 
02:49:20.710 --> 02:49:20.720 align:start position:0%
is how much it is going to basically
 
02:49:22.910 --> 02:49:22.920 align:start position:0%
distri be distributed across the state
 
02:49:24.710 --> 02:49:24.720 align:start position:0%
I'm willing to bet the vast majority of
 
02:49:27.790 --> 02:49:27.800 align:start position:0%
our constituents would say absolutely
 
02:49:29.870 --> 02:49:29.880 align:start position:0%
for us not to be The Dumping Ground of
 
02:49:31.870 --> 02:49:31.880 align:start position:0%
solid waste for New England I would
 
02:49:35.510 --> 02:49:35.520 align:start position:0%
absolutely Pony up my share of the taxes
 
02:49:37.309 --> 02:49:37.319 align:start position:0%
that it would take for the state to do
 
02:49:40.590 --> 02:49:40.600 align:start position:0%
that for the larger good of making sure
 
02:49:41.670 --> 02:49:41.680 align:start position:0%
that we're protecting both the
 
02:49:42.910 --> 02:49:42.920 align:start position:0%
environment and the public health I
 
02:49:46.229 --> 02:49:46.239 align:start position:0%
don't think our constituents uh see this
 
02:49:48.229 --> 02:49:48.239 align:start position:0%
being nearly as complicated as we tend
 
02:49:51.150 --> 02:49:51.160 align:start position:0%
to make it thank you okay represent
 
02:49:53.790 --> 02:49:53.800 align:start position:0%
Bixby yeah so I'd like to point out that
 
02:49:55.910 --> 02:49:55.920 align:start position:0%
currently we have six operating
 
02:49:58.830 --> 02:49:58.840 align:start position:0%
landfills in the state four of those are
 
02:50:03.389 --> 02:50:03.399 align:start position:0%
publicly owned uh so Mount carbury the
 
02:50:06.670 --> 02:50:06.680 align:start position:0%
one in uh Conway or North Conway Nashua
 
02:50:10.030 --> 02:50:10.040 align:start position:0%
and Lebanon are all publicly owned
 
02:50:10.040 --> 02:50:11.710 align:start position:0%
and Lebanon are all publicly owned
landfills

02:50:11.710 --> 02:50:11.720 align:start position:0%
landfills
 
02:50:15.910 --> 02:50:15.920 align:start position:0%
and uh they are not uh
 
02:50:18.389 --> 02:50:18.399 align:start position:0%
they are not damaging the business
 
02:50:21.269 --> 02:50:21.279 align:start position:0%
environment uh and they have more
 
02:50:24.670 --> 02:50:24.680 align:start position:0%
control over what goes into them than
 
02:50:29.429 --> 02:50:29.439 align:start position:0%
the uh than the two private landfills uh
 
02:50:33.070 --> 02:50:33.080 align:start position:0%
so uh I I think that we have examples of
 
02:50:35.590 --> 02:50:35.600 align:start position:0%
public landfills working already the
 
02:50:38.750 --> 02:50:38.760 align:start position:0%
other thing is that this bill not only
 
02:50:38.760 --> 02:50:40.750 align:start position:0%
other thing is that this bill not only
authorizes

02:50:40.750 --> 02:50:40.760 align:start position:0%
authorizes
 
02:50:45.389 --> 02:50:45.399 align:start position:0%
um or it it says that it can be uh a
 
02:50:47.590 --> 02:50:47.600 align:start position:0%
state owned or owned by a subdivision
 
02:50:51.710 --> 02:50:51.720 align:start position:0%
thereof so uh it could be that we you
 
02:50:54.229 --> 02:50:54.239 align:start position:0%
know the state doesn't choose to uh
 
02:50:58.229 --> 02:50:58.239 align:start position:0%
purchase land a landfill a a spot for
 
02:51:01.030 --> 02:51:01.040 align:start position:0%
landfill but one of our counties might
 
02:51:03.150 --> 02:51:03.160 align:start position:0%
and that would be entirely within the
 
02:51:06.710 --> 02:51:06.720 align:start position:0%
scope of this bill uh the idea is that
 
02:51:06.720 --> 02:51:07.429 align:start position:0%
scope of this bill uh the idea is that
if

02:51:07.429 --> 02:51:07.439 align:start position:0%
if
 
02:51:11.070 --> 02:51:11.080 align:start position:0%
we uh have that public owner the the
 
02:51:14.309 --> 02:51:14.319 align:start position:0%
public ownership basically provides
 
02:51:16.670 --> 02:51:16.680 align:start position:0%
public public oversight and public
 
02:51:19.790 --> 02:51:19.800 align:start position:0%
control and that's what we're and what
 
02:51:23.030 --> 02:51:23.040 align:start position:0%
we're seeing in
 
02:51:25.910 --> 02:51:25.920 align:start position:0%
uh in the case of one of the privately
 
02:51:28.550 --> 02:51:28.560 align:start position:0%
owned land uh landfills in the state is
 
02:51:31.429 --> 02:51:31.439 align:start position:0%
that the people who live around it are
 
02:51:33.830 --> 02:51:33.840 align:start position:0%
really concerned about the lack of
 
02:51:37.309 --> 02:51:37.319 align:start position:0%
public control of what's going into it
 
02:51:40.469 --> 02:51:40.479 align:start position:0%
and that they feel that their their
 
02:51:42.550 --> 02:51:42.560 align:start position:0%
livelihoods are threatened because they
 
02:51:45.710 --> 02:51:45.720 align:start position:0%
depend on tourism they depend on
 
02:51:48.550 --> 02:51:48.560 align:start position:0%
businesses that have that are involved
 
02:51:51.110 --> 02:51:51.120 align:start position:0%
with the natural resources that that
 
02:51:53.510 --> 02:51:53.520 align:start position:0%
landfill might be impinging on and there
 
02:51:55.269 --> 02:51:55.279 align:start position:0%
is a proposed landfill that might
 
02:51:57.550 --> 02:51:57.560 align:start position:0%
further impinge on their
 
02:52:00.710 --> 02:52:00.720 align:start position:0%
livelihoods uh and I think that by
 
02:52:03.070 --> 02:52:03.080 align:start position:0%
putting it in the public domain we can
 
02:52:06.670 --> 02:52:06.680 align:start position:0%
be more careful of the broader uh
 
02:52:09.550 --> 02:52:09.560 align:start position:0%
environmental and business environment
 
02:52:12.309 --> 02:52:12.319 align:start position:0%
than uh by saying okay well we'll we'll
 
02:52:14.710 --> 02:52:14.720 align:start position:0%
just let a large company put a l
 
02:52:16.630 --> 02:52:16.640 align:start position:0%
somewhere but don't we already have
 
02:52:18.429 --> 02:52:18.439 align:start position:0%
public oversight and public control
 
02:52:20.550 --> 02:52:20.560 align:start position:0%
through our regulator through our
 
02:52:22.510 --> 02:52:22.520 align:start position:0%
department of environmental services for
 
02:52:24.990 --> 02:52:25.000 align:start position:0%
all intents and purposes the state is
 
02:52:26.830 --> 02:52:26.840 align:start position:0%
controlling the
 
02:52:28.950 --> 02:52:28.960 align:start position:0%
landfill are they
 
02:52:32.870 --> 02:52:32.880 align:start position:0%
not to some extent yes the permitting
 
02:52:35.229 --> 02:52:35.239 align:start position:0%
process the permitting process does
 
02:52:38.469 --> 02:52:38.479 align:start position:0%
allow them a degree of control but they
 
02:52:41.429 --> 02:52:41.439 align:start position:0%
don't have the level of control to say
 
02:52:43.550 --> 02:52:43.560 align:start position:0%
no we can't take mattres from
 
02:52:45.469 --> 02:52:45.479 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts they don't have the level
 
02:52:49.309 --> 02:52:49.319 align:start position:0%
of control to uh say we can't have more
 
02:52:51.910 --> 02:52:51.920 align:start position:0%
than a certain amount of out ofate waste
 
02:52:54.590 --> 02:52:54.600 align:start position:0%
uh that something that Dees just does
 
02:52:58.150 --> 02:52:58.160 align:start position:0%
not have the legal capacity to do and by
 
02:53:00.830 --> 02:53:00.840 align:start position:0%
putting into PRI into State owner into
 
02:53:04.510 --> 02:53:04.520 align:start position:0%
public ownership we would uh get that
 
02:53:06.790 --> 02:53:06.800 align:start position:0%
level of control which is what we need
 
02:53:09.309 --> 02:53:09.319 align:start position:0%
in order to stop out of state waste
 
02:53:12.349 --> 02:53:12.359 align:start position:0%
representative K thank you madam chair
 
02:53:14.550 --> 02:53:14.560 align:start position:0%
um couple of points but I have a
 
02:53:17.550 --> 02:53:17.560 align:start position:0%
question for representative Bixby of the
 
02:53:20.309 --> 02:53:20.319 align:start position:0%
publicly owned landfills is there
 
02:53:23.190 --> 02:53:23.200 align:start position:0%
anything in statute that prohibits
 
02:53:25.510 --> 02:53:25.520 align:start position:0%
publicly owned landfills and of those
 
02:53:30.830 --> 02:53:30.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:34.429 --> 02:53:34.439 align:start position:0%
ownership uh so there is nothing that
 
02:53:36.590 --> 02:53:36.600 align:start position:0%
prohibits uh there there's nothing that
 
02:53:38.790 --> 02:53:38.800 align:start position:0%
prohibits a public loan landfill at the
 
02:53:43.950 --> 02:53:43.960 align:start position:0%
moment uh there is uh so and in terms of
 
02:53:46.349 --> 02:53:46.359 align:start position:0%
the owner ership the city of nasba owns
 
02:53:49.190 --> 02:53:49.200 align:start position:0%
their landfill uh I believe that it's
 
02:53:53.030 --> 02:53:53.040 align:start position:0%
the city of Berlin Berlin or uh Berlin
 
02:53:54.710 --> 02:53:54.720 align:start position:0%
and Berlin and some of the other
 
02:53:56.710 --> 02:53:56.720 align:start position:0%
surrounding towns that owns Mount
 
02:54:00.389 --> 02:54:00.399 align:start position:0%
carbury uh I believe that I I'm it's I'm
 
02:54:01.670 --> 02:54:01.680 align:start position:0%
not sure whether it's Conway or North
 
02:54:05.229 --> 02:54:05.239 align:start position:0%
Conway but that that municipality owns
 
02:54:09.389 --> 02:54:09.399 align:start position:0%
that landfill Lebanon owns uh the the
 
02:54:12.469 --> 02:54:12.479 align:start position:0%
landfill in Lebanon uh they make choices
 
02:54:14.830 --> 02:54:14.840 align:start position:0%
about where they get their their trash
 
02:54:17.070 --> 02:54:17.080 align:start position:0%
from so Lebanon is willing to take trash
 
02:54:19.309 --> 02:54:19.319 align:start position:0%
from a few towns in Vermont that are
 
02:54:22.070 --> 02:54:22.080 align:start position:0%
right across the river but uh not from
 
02:54:25.150 --> 02:54:25.160 align:start position:0%
every town in New Hampshire because it's
 
02:54:27.550 --> 02:54:27.560 align:start position:0%
a town Landfield they can choose
 
02:54:31.070 --> 02:54:31.080 align:start position:0%
representative kto followup right so and
 
02:54:33.309 --> 02:54:33.319 align:start position:0%
I believe that these publicly owned
 
02:54:36.870 --> 02:54:36.880 align:start position:0%
landfills also have to go through have
 
02:54:40.870 --> 02:54:40.880 align:start position:0%
Dees as their oversight also I'm
 
02:54:43.269 --> 02:54:43.279 align:start position:0%
assuming would that be correct that is
 
02:54:44.670 --> 02:54:44.680 align:start position:0%
correct they have to meet all the
 
02:54:47.870 --> 02:54:47.880 align:start position:0%
permitting requirements that a private
 
02:54:50.389 --> 02:54:50.399 align:start position:0%
land would landfill would have to meet
 
02:54:50.399 --> 02:54:52.469 align:start position:0%
land would landfill would have to meet
okay

02:54:52.469 --> 02:54:52.479 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:54:55.710 --> 02:54:55.720 align:start position:0%
so right
 
02:54:57.910 --> 02:54:57.920 align:start position:0%
now if the
 
02:55:00.670 --> 02:55:00.680 align:start position:0%
public with we just put a more we just
 
02:55:03.550 --> 02:55:03.560 align:start position:0%
voted for moratorium and on all
 
02:55:06.710 --> 02:55:06.720 align:start position:0%
landfills for four
 
02:55:10.630 --> 02:55:10.640 align:start position:0%
years or three and a half whatever um
 
02:55:12.110 --> 02:55:12.120 align:start position:0%
and the thing
 
02:55:15.269 --> 02:55:15.279 align:start position:0%
is is that
 
02:55:18.870 --> 02:55:18.880 align:start position:0%
when I look I mean so right now Dees is
 
02:55:21.870 --> 02:55:21.880 align:start position:0%
like the oversight board
 
02:55:26.510 --> 02:55:26.520 align:start position:0%
right but now we want them to do
 
02:55:29.950 --> 02:55:29.960 align:start position:0%
both from I work in
 
02:55:32.830 --> 02:55:32.840 align:start position:0%
manufacturing and I had an incident
 
02:55:36.429 --> 02:55:36.439 align:start position:0%
where I had a production person said oh
 
02:55:38.590 --> 02:55:38.600 align:start position:0%
the QC person's out don't worry I'll
 
02:55:39.910 --> 02:55:39.920 align:start position:0%
take care of
 
02:55:42.670 --> 02:55:42.680 align:start position:0%
QC and to me that's the fox watching the
 
02:55:45.790 --> 02:55:45.800 align:start position:0%
hen house
 
02:55:49.150 --> 02:55:49.160 align:start position:0%
so I'm not saying that's what's going to
 
02:55:51.830 --> 02:55:51.840 align:start position:0%
happen but that's the analogy I'm going
 
02:55:51.840 --> 02:55:53.510 align:start position:0%
happen but that's the analogy I'm going
to

02:55:53.510 --> 02:55:53.520 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:55:53.520 --> 02:55:55.349 align:start position:0%
to
use

02:55:55.349 --> 02:55:55.359 align:start position:0%
use
 
02:55:59.269 --> 02:55:59.279 align:start position:0%
because we can already have publicly
 
02:55:59.279 --> 02:56:00.790 align:start position:0%
because we can already have publicly
owned

02:56:00.790 --> 02:56:00.800 align:start position:0%
owned
 
02:56:04.790 --> 02:56:04.800 align:start position:0%
landfills and the towns in their
 
02:56:07.389 --> 02:56:07.399 align:start position:0%
zoning can have hearings and with these
 
02:56:09.389 --> 02:56:09.399 align:start position:0%
other bills that we're doing with impact
 
02:56:11.190 --> 02:56:11.200 align:start position:0%
studies and public
 
02:56:13.750 --> 02:56:13.760 align:start position:0%
benefit why do we need the state to own
 
02:56:16.630 --> 02:56:16.640 align:start position:0%
a uh be the ones owning the landfill I
 
02:56:19.030 --> 02:56:19.040 align:start position:0%
understand the intent is to reduce waste
 
02:56:22.790 --> 02:56:22.800 align:start position:0%
coming in I understand that I think
 
02:56:24.150 --> 02:56:24.160 align:start position:0%
that's already going to be partly
 
02:56:25.710 --> 02:56:25.720 align:start position:0%
accomplished through the moratorium
 
02:56:27.950 --> 02:56:27.960 align:start position:0%
because these landfills already have to
 
02:56:31.110 --> 02:56:31.120 align:start position:0%
make sure that they take New Hampshire
 
02:56:33.030 --> 02:56:33.040 align:start position:0%
waste before they take out of state
 
02:56:36.269 --> 02:56:36.279 align:start position:0%
waste so by putting a moratorium on that
 
02:56:38.910 --> 02:56:38.920 align:start position:0%
that means right now there is no more
 
02:56:42.070 --> 02:56:42.080 align:start position:0%
expansions I mean I well we can expand
 
02:56:44.309 --> 02:56:44.319 align:start position:0%
but still that takes time but but there
 
02:56:48.070 --> 02:56:48.080 align:start position:0%
can be no landfill cited so there's no
 
02:56:50.830 --> 02:56:50.840 align:start position:0%
more we're at a finite amount of space
 
02:56:52.349 --> 02:56:52.359 align:start position:0%
right now and we know one of the
 
02:56:55.590 --> 02:56:55.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:58.630 --> 02:56:58.640 align:start position:0%
closing I I'd like to offer just kind of
 
02:57:02.190 --> 02:57:02.200 align:start position:0%
a thought instead of prohibiting private
 
02:57:05.550 --> 02:57:05.560 align:start position:0%
ownership of landfills why wouldn't we
 
02:57:09.910 --> 02:57:09.920 align:start position:0%
say right into statute that um 50% of
 
02:57:12.790 --> 02:57:12.800 align:start position:0%
the landfills that are in New Hampshire
 
02:57:15.030 --> 02:57:15.040 align:start position:0%
or that would be permitted in New
 
02:57:17.790 --> 02:57:17.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire would be publicly owned and
 
02:57:19.910 --> 02:57:19.920 align:start position:0%
50% privately
 
02:57:22.790 --> 02:57:22.800 align:start position:0%
owned what what are people think
 
02:57:25.030 --> 02:57:25.040 align:start position:0%
thoughts of that representative
 
02:57:29.389 --> 02:57:29.399 align:start position:0%
ger uh I think my my initial reaction to
 
02:57:31.030 --> 02:57:31.040 align:start position:0%
that would be that that would be
 
02:57:31.040 --> 02:57:32.269 align:start position:0%
that would be that that would be
difficult

02:57:32.269 --> 02:57:32.279 align:start position:0%
difficult
 
02:57:35.550 --> 02:57:35.560 align:start position:0%
to enforce and maintain right I mean how
 
02:57:38.030 --> 02:57:38.040 align:start position:0%
do we determine what it
 
02:57:42.630 --> 02:57:42.640 align:start position:0%
is if we have an uneven number in and of
 
02:57:44.190 --> 02:57:44.200 align:start position:0%
itself right are we talking talking
 
02:57:47.870 --> 02:57:47.880 align:start position:0%
about capacity so here I understand I I
 
02:57:49.349 --> 02:57:49.359 align:start position:0%
I think where you're going but I think
 
02:57:50.910 --> 02:57:50.920 align:start position:0%
actually being able to determine what
 
02:57:53.870 --> 02:57:53.880 align:start position:0%
constitutes 50% would be somewhat
 
02:57:55.229 --> 02:57:55.239 align:start position:0%
difficult and then I think it can be
 
02:57:57.110 --> 02:57:57.120 align:start position:0%
easily kind of thrown off and then what
 
02:57:58.950 --> 02:57:58.960 align:start position:0%
happens if we are out of balance and
 
02:58:02.469 --> 02:58:02.479 align:start position:0%
it's 640 or 55 65 again if it's just the
 
02:58:04.670 --> 02:58:04.680 align:start position:0%
number or we talk about the acreage or
 
02:58:07.229 --> 02:58:07.239 align:start position:0%
we talk about number the number of
 
02:58:07.239 --> 02:58:08.309 align:start position:0%
we talk about number the number of
operating

02:58:08.309 --> 02:58:08.319 align:start position:0%
operating
 
02:58:11.590 --> 02:58:11.600 align:start position:0%
facilities that I because again I'm I'm
 
02:58:11.600 --> 02:58:12.910 align:start position:0%
facilities that I because again I'm I'm
just

02:58:12.910 --> 02:58:12.920 align:start position:0%
just
 
02:58:16.110 --> 02:58:16.120 align:start position:0%
so just so don't like the idea of of
 
02:58:18.110 --> 02:58:18.120 align:start position:0%
prohibiting private ownership of
 
02:58:21.550 --> 02:58:21.560 align:start position:0%
anything that um and I know it's done
 
02:58:23.349 --> 02:58:23.359 align:start position:0%
you know we do have things that are
 
02:58:27.630 --> 02:58:27.640 align:start position:0%
publicly owned and that's okay but um
 
02:58:30.790 --> 02:58:30.800 align:start position:0%
we're still not Banning people from uh
 
02:58:33.309 --> 02:58:33.319 align:start position:0%
having a private ownership of a of a ski
 
02:58:35.550 --> 02:58:35.560 align:start position:0%
resort you know
 
02:58:38.229 --> 02:58:38.239 align:start position:0%
um I I just think you're just in matter
 
02:58:39.510 --> 02:58:39.520 align:start position:0%
of of
 
02:58:42.910 --> 02:58:42.920 align:start position:0%
control uh you know if we're looking
 
02:58:45.550 --> 02:58:45.560 align:start position:0%
to reduce the amount of solid waste
 
02:58:47.429 --> 02:58:47.439 align:start position:0%
coming in from out of states and we see
 
02:58:49.429 --> 02:58:49.439 align:start position:0%
that having
 
02:58:52.269 --> 02:58:52.279 align:start position:0%
publicly publicly owned ones would sort
 
02:58:55.750 --> 02:58:55.760 align:start position:0%
of move us into that direction that if
 
02:58:59.950 --> 02:58:59.960 align:start position:0%
we could um you know not ban it but
 
02:59:02.429 --> 02:59:02.439 align:start position:0%
limit the the amount of private
 
02:59:05.349 --> 02:59:05.359 align:start position:0%
ownership um you know limit the amount
 
02:59:07.389 --> 02:59:07.399 align:start position:0%
of ownership of landfills that just
 
02:59:10.150 --> 02:59:10.160 align:start position:0%
seems to be sort of a compromise there
 
02:59:12.269 --> 02:59:12.279 align:start position:0%
okay can I also can I clarify something
 
02:59:14.790 --> 02:59:14.800 align:start position:0%
to just uh something has come up several
 
02:59:17.349 --> 02:59:17.359 align:start position:0%
times in previous discussions the the
 
02:59:19.030 --> 02:59:19.040 align:start position:0%
private landfills in particular in the
 
02:59:21.710 --> 02:59:21.720 align:start position:0%
state do not put New Hampshire Solid
 
02:59:24.030 --> 02:59:24.040 align:start position:0%
Waste ahead of out of state solid waste
 
02:59:26.870 --> 02:59:26.880 align:start position:0%
our capacity is determined by New
 
02:59:29.550 --> 02:59:29.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire produced Solid Waste but we
 
02:59:34.309 --> 02:59:34.319 align:start position:0%
don't measure uh per se right so that we
 
02:59:36.190 --> 02:59:36.200 align:start position:0%
would stop taking out of state waste at
 
02:59:37.950 --> 02:59:37.960 align:start position:0%
a certain point right so I just wanted
 
02:59:40.710 --> 02:59:40.720 align:start position:0%
to to clarify there is no requirement
 
02:59:42.950 --> 02:59:42.960 align:start position:0%
for the state to or or pardon me any of
 
02:59:44.830 --> 02:59:44.840 align:start position:0%
our private landfills to put New
 
02:59:47.990 --> 02:59:48.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Solid Waste ahead of out ofate
 
02:59:50.590 --> 02:59:50.600 align:start position:0%
Solid Waste right but don't they
 
02:59:52.670 --> 02:59:52.680 align:start position:0%
represent thank you but don't they have
 
02:59:55.670 --> 02:59:55.680 align:start position:0%
to make sure that under their existing
 
02:59:57.309 --> 02:59:57.319 align:start position:0%
landfills that they have to be able to
 
02:59:59.710 --> 02:59:59.720 align:start position:0%
make sure they be it fulfills New
 
03:00:03.229 --> 03:00:03.239 align:start position:0%
Hampshire waste so that you know if if
 
03:00:05.950 --> 03:00:05.960 align:start position:0%
they're right now they're good until say
 
03:00:09.309 --> 03:00:09.319 align:start position:0%
2030 so they have six years don't they
 
03:00:10.710 --> 03:00:10.720 align:start position:0%
have to make sure they can take New
 
03:00:13.269 --> 03:00:13.279 align:start position:0%
Hampshire waste for the next 6 years and
 
03:00:14.910 --> 03:00:14.920 align:start position:0%
fulfill that
 
03:00:17.070 --> 03:00:17.080 align:start position:0%
I respond you may respond just want to
 
03:00:19.070 --> 03:00:19.080 align:start position:0%
make sure I was in order thank you no
 
03:00:20.830 --> 03:00:20.840 align:start position:0%
what they're deter when they determine
 
03:00:23.309 --> 03:00:23.319 align:start position:0%
capacity they determine it based on
 
03:00:25.429 --> 03:00:25.439 align:start position:0%
their projection of what new instate
 
03:00:27.990 --> 03:00:28.000 align:start position:0%
Solid Waste production is going to be so
 
03:00:30.190 --> 03:00:30.200 align:start position:0%
that theoretically like if if this
 
03:00:31.630 --> 03:00:31.640 align:start position:0%
hopefully won't happen but if if we
 
03:00:34.950 --> 03:00:34.960 align:start position:0%
started taking in 55 60% of outof State
 
03:00:36.630 --> 03:00:36.640 align:start position:0%
waste our capacity would drop
 
03:00:38.790 --> 03:00:38.800 align:start position:0%
dramatically because the capacity was
 
03:00:40.469 --> 03:00:40.479 align:start position:0%
determined based on out of state waste
 
03:00:42.590 --> 03:00:42.600 align:start position:0%
so it's not a requirement that is simply
 
03:00:45.349 --> 03:00:45.359 align:start position:0%
the metric they Ed to determine capacity
 
03:00:48.510 --> 03:00:48.520 align:start position:0%
when they permit so representative com
 
03:00:49.990 --> 03:00:50.000 align:start position:0%
thank you so maybe one of the things
 
03:00:52.269 --> 03:00:52.279 align:start position:0%
that we need to put in there is that
 
03:00:54.190 --> 03:00:54.200 align:start position:0%
they have to take in consideration in
 
03:00:57.429 --> 03:00:57.439 align:start position:0%
their metric New Hampshire waste
 
03:01:00.229 --> 03:01:00.239 align:start position:0%
first represent
 
03:01:03.670 --> 03:01:03.680 align:start position:0%
dsy thank you madam chair um yesterday I
 
03:01:06.870 --> 03:01:06.880 align:start position:0%
had a doctor's appointment down in L and
 
03:01:09.590 --> 03:01:09.600 align:start position:0%
when I came back okay so I think maybe
 
03:01:13.229 --> 03:01:13.239 align:start position:0%
we're talking about 18 miles I noticed
 
03:01:16.790 --> 03:01:16.800 align:start position:0%
four four garbage trucks on the road
 
03:01:21.030 --> 03:01:21.040 align:start position:0%
okay cassella Waste Management Shaws and
 
03:01:23.990 --> 03:01:24.000 align:start position:0%
Harvey's okay that was in a matter of
 
03:01:26.510 --> 03:01:26.520 align:start position:0%
like 25 minutes being on the highway
 
03:01:29.670 --> 03:01:29.680 align:start position:0%
four garbage trucks there's got to be
 
03:01:32.910 --> 03:01:32.920 align:start position:0%
money in garbage okay so you know what
 
03:01:36.510 --> 03:01:36.520 align:start position:0%
I'm concerned about is that I support
 
03:01:39.870 --> 03:01:39.880 align:start position:0%
both of these bills uh I like the fact
 
03:01:42.990 --> 03:01:43.000 align:start position:0%
that there is um not just skin in the
 
03:01:45.750 --> 03:01:45.760 align:start position:0%
game but but more government oversight I
 
03:01:48.870 --> 03:01:48.880 align:start position:0%
like the fact that if it's owned if the
 
03:01:51.269 --> 03:01:51.279 align:start position:0%
land is owned by the state and operated
 
03:01:53.750 --> 03:01:53.760 align:start position:0%
by a private company that we don't have
 
03:01:57.510 --> 03:01:57.520 align:start position:0%
to um that we don't have to accept waste
 
03:01:59.630 --> 03:01:59.640 align:start position:0%
from out of state that we have control
 
03:02:02.389 --> 03:02:02.399 align:start position:0%
over that because to be honest with you
 
03:02:05.429 --> 03:02:05.439 align:start position:0%
every Tom Dick and Harry can I mean the
 
03:02:07.309 --> 03:02:07.319 align:start position:0%
the barriers to entry to get into the
 
03:02:09.630 --> 03:02:09.640 align:start position:0%
garbage business to me seem to be very
 
03:02:12.550 --> 03:02:12.560 align:start position:0%
low I mean maybe it's a truck
 
03:02:15.590 --> 03:02:15.600 align:start position:0%
$250,000 okay you buy a truck and you
 
03:02:18.630 --> 03:02:18.640 align:start position:0%
you finance it and voila you're in the
 
03:02:20.670 --> 03:02:20.680 align:start position:0%
garbage business the other thing that I
 
03:02:24.309 --> 03:02:24.319 align:start position:0%
like about um Municipal owned or this
 
03:02:26.229 --> 03:02:26.239 align:start position:0%
the state-owned land and having more
 
03:02:29.110 --> 03:02:29.120 align:start position:0%
regulation is that you know we can't
 
03:02:32.630 --> 03:02:32.640 align:start position:0%
create more land and it's not just the
 
03:02:35.429 --> 03:02:35.439 align:start position:0%
amount that's going in it's what's going
 
03:02:38.630 --> 03:02:38.640 align:start position:0%
in okay and under private control
 
03:02:41.550 --> 03:02:41.560 align:start position:0%
private ownership we really have very
 
03:02:46.190 --> 03:02:46.200 align:start position:0%
very limited ability to oversee that and
 
03:02:49.750 --> 03:02:49.760 align:start position:0%
to say that we that Dees oversees it
 
03:02:51.510 --> 03:02:51.520 align:start position:0%
I've been on this committee this is my
 
03:02:54.910 --> 03:02:54.920 align:start position:0%
sixth year and how many times how many
 
03:02:57.429 --> 03:02:57.439 align:start position:0%
letters have we seen that we cannot
 
03:03:00.750 --> 03:03:00.760 align:start position:0%
Implement AB C or D because we do not
 
03:03:03.389 --> 03:03:03.399 align:start position:0%
have the resources to fund another
 
03:03:06.550 --> 03:03:06.560 align:start position:0%
position so for us to sit here and think
 
03:03:09.389 --> 03:03:09.399 align:start position:0%
that Dees is providing any amount of
 
03:03:12.349 --> 03:03:12.359 align:start position:0%
oversight you know in existing uh
 
03:03:15.990 --> 03:03:16.000 align:start position:0%
landfills you know I think you know is
 
03:03:21.229 --> 03:03:21.239 align:start position:0%
um you know uh being silly on our part
 
03:03:23.030 --> 03:03:23.040 align:start position:0%
and the last thing I I'll I'll notice
 
03:03:25.429 --> 03:03:25.439 align:start position:0%
and I haven't read them in depth but
 
03:03:27.910 --> 03:03:27.920 align:start position:0%
I've seen you know a lot of complaints
 
03:03:32.389 --> 03:03:32.399 align:start position:0%
or uh go to Dees regarding issues um
 
03:03:34.870 --> 03:03:34.880 align:start position:0%
with Bethlehem I think it is you know up
 
03:03:38.309 --> 03:03:38.319 align:start position:0%
in the north country and and the process
 
03:03:41.469 --> 03:03:41.479 align:start position:0%
to get any of those complaints you know
 
03:03:43.950 --> 03:03:43.960 align:start position:0%
recognized and through the system I mean
 
03:03:46.030 --> 03:03:46.040 align:start position:0%
it just seems like one complaint is
 
03:03:48.590 --> 03:03:48.600 align:start position:0%
piled up on another complaint if the
 
03:03:52.030 --> 03:03:52.040 align:start position:0%
city if the state owns the land and the
 
03:03:54.590 --> 03:03:54.600 align:start position:0%
operator is not doing its job we can
 
03:03:57.309 --> 03:03:57.319 align:start position:0%
fire them if it's privately owned we
 
03:04:00.590 --> 03:04:00.600 align:start position:0%
can't so I mean I think we need and
 
03:04:03.309 --> 03:04:03.319 align:start position:0%
coming from nashwa We Bought you know
 
03:04:06.510 --> 03:04:06.520 align:start position:0%
the best thing our city ever did was buy
 
03:04:10.389 --> 03:04:10.399 align:start position:0%
the land in 1964 for the landfill it
 
03:04:14.269 --> 03:04:14.279 align:start position:0%
operates well uh we have no issues with
 
03:04:16.469 --> 03:04:16.479 align:start position:0%
it every once in a while I mean whenever
 
03:04:19.110 --> 03:04:19.120 align:start position:0%
there's an issue it's addressed
 
03:04:22.229 --> 03:04:22.239 align:start position:0%
immediately okay because it's the city
 
03:04:23.910 --> 03:04:23.920 align:start position:0%
it's the people in the city and it's the
 
03:04:26.429 --> 03:04:26.439 align:start position:0%
voters in the city okay that own the
 
03:04:29.510 --> 03:04:29.520 align:start position:0%
landfill and elect the people to run it
 
03:04:32.750 --> 03:04:32.760 align:start position:0%
so I mean from my perspective I think
 
03:04:35.990 --> 03:04:36.000 align:start position:0%
it's a win-win to go uh with state-owned
 
03:04:37.510 --> 03:04:37.520 align:start position:0%
land privately
 
03:04:41.990 --> 03:04:42.000 align:start position:0%
Run Okay um we're we're pushing here at
 
03:04:45.790 --> 03:04:45.800 align:start position:0%
noon and um I'll have Kelly and then uh
 
03:04:47.510 --> 03:04:47.520 align:start position:0%
I'd like to break for lunch but I'm I'm
 
03:04:49.469 --> 03:04:49.479 align:start position:0%
wondering if the committee would be
 
03:04:52.550 --> 03:04:52.560 align:start position:0%
considering um continuing a a work
 
03:04:54.630 --> 03:04:54.640 align:start position:0%
session and have further discussion on
 
03:04:58.790 --> 03:04:58.800 align:start position:0%
these two bills at another date so um I
 
03:05:01.030 --> 03:05:01.040 align:start position:0%
think we we've got a lot of things that
 
03:05:03.710 --> 03:05:03.720 align:start position:0%
we need to kind of air out and uh I
 
03:05:06.269 --> 03:05:06.279 align:start position:0%
think it's constructive to at least talk
 
03:05:08.710 --> 03:05:08.720 align:start position:0%
about it and see where we uh where we
 
03:05:11.790 --> 03:05:11.800 align:start position:0%
want to go with them represent
 
03:05:14.550 --> 03:05:14.560 align:start position:0%
Penza so BAS upon the knowledge that I
 
03:05:18.429 --> 03:05:18.439 align:start position:0%
have um Dees currently only has like one
 
03:05:22.870 --> 03:05:22.880 align:start position:0%
person that is that is out whether it be
 
03:05:26.469 --> 03:05:26.479 align:start position:0%
you know inspecting um like going on
 
03:05:28.710 --> 03:05:28.720 align:start position:0%
site to whether it be a landfill or a
 
03:05:31.670 --> 03:05:31.680 align:start position:0%
transfer station I don't I don't believe
 
03:05:36.550 --> 03:05:36.560 align:start position:0%
that this bill is looking to to um put
 
03:05:38.670 --> 03:05:38.680 align:start position:0%
additional staff or any of that I think
 
03:05:42.389 --> 03:05:42.399 align:start position:0%
it actually operates the exact same way
 
03:05:45.229 --> 03:05:45.239 align:start position:0%
that it currently is operating the only
 
03:05:49.670 --> 03:05:49.680 align:start position:0%
change is in a sense we own the
 
03:05:52.550 --> 03:05:52.560 align:start position:0%
property that's my end my that's my idea
 
03:05:56.990 --> 03:05:57.000 align:start position:0%
of skin in the game and so so there is
 
03:05:59.389 --> 03:05:59.399 align:start position:0%
there's that level of oversight just
 
03:06:02.309 --> 03:06:02.319 align:start position:0%
because we have that ownership the other
 
03:06:05.110 --> 03:06:05.120 align:start position:0%
piece is we don't need we're we're
 
03:06:08.030 --> 03:06:08.040 align:start position:0%
talking about like one landfill in The
 
03:06:08.040 --> 03:06:08.950 align:start position:0%
talking about like one landfill in The
Next

03:06:08.950 --> 03:06:08.960 align:start position:0%
Next
 
03:06:11.710 --> 03:06:11.720 align:start position:0%
Century so you know based upon this
 
03:06:12.990 --> 03:06:13.000 align:start position:0%
we're we're acting like you know we're
 
03:06:14.429 --> 03:06:14.439 align:start position:0%
going to we're gonna you know there's
 
03:06:15.630 --> 03:06:15.640 align:start position:0%
going to be landfills that are going to
 
03:06:17.870 --> 03:06:17.880 align:start position:0%
crop up every five years or that's not
 
03:06:20.990 --> 03:06:21.000 align:start position:0%
going to happen so this bill passing
 
03:06:24.309 --> 03:06:24.319 align:start position:0%
would maybe mean the state owns property
 
03:06:27.670 --> 03:06:27.680 align:start position:0%
for a landfill two of them in in the
 
03:06:32.670 --> 03:06:32.680 align:start position:0%
next hundred years that the other thing
 
03:06:36.110 --> 03:06:36.120 align:start position:0%
is I think this changes the landscape
 
03:06:39.349 --> 03:06:39.359 align:start position:0%
right because where's the necessity if
 
03:06:41.190 --> 03:06:41.200 align:start position:0%
we know what the need is and the state
 
03:06:43.590 --> 03:06:43.600 align:start position:0%
knows what the need is Dees knows what
 
03:06:47.590 --> 03:06:47.600 align:start position:0%
the need is then we don't need to to
 
03:06:49.750 --> 03:06:49.760 align:start position:0%
have all of these private landfills
 
03:06:52.070 --> 03:06:52.080 align:start position:0%
cropping up all over New Hampshire so
 
03:06:54.750 --> 03:06:54.760 align:start position:0%
it's truly it's a needs-based type of
 
03:06:58.990 --> 03:06:59.000 align:start position:0%
thing that's how I think of this so my
 
03:07:00.590 --> 03:07:00.600 align:start position:0%
two cents
 
03:07:04.670 --> 03:07:04.680 align:start position:0%
okay all right I'm going to um close out
 
03:07:07.990 --> 03:07:08.000 align:start position:0%
this work session and I think that we
 
03:07:11.349 --> 03:07:11.359 align:start position:0%
will um continue discussions about these
 
03:07:16.750 --> 03:07:16.760 align:start position:0%
two bills um in at a future date um and
 
03:07:19.710 --> 03:07:19.720 align:start position:0%
um I hope you have a good
 
03:07:22.309 --> 03:07:22.319 align:start position:0%
lunch thank you we get to talk about
 
03:07:24.710 --> 03:07:24.720 align:start position:0%
kangaroos oh yes
 
03:07:42.110 --> 03:07:42.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:42.120 --> 04:03:30.309 align:start position:0%
 
bill

comments thank you madam chair parison
 
04:04:38.910 --> 04:04:38.920 align:start position:0%
and fellow Le
 
04:04:38.920 --> 04:04:41.389 align:start position:0%
and fellow Le
legislators

04:04:41.389 --> 04:04:41.399 align:start position:0%
legislators
 
04:04:44.910 --> 04:04:44.920 align:start position:0%
um I had one of one of our speakers
 
04:04:47.990 --> 04:04:48.000 align:start position:0%
contact me and asked me if they would if
 
04:04:51.550 --> 04:04:51.560 align:start position:0%
I would introduce this bill um and I
 
04:04:54.429 --> 04:04:54.439 align:start position:0%
thought about it I said how many times
 
04:04:56.269 --> 04:04:56.279 align:start position:0%
have I walked into my kitchen and I see
 
04:04:58.750 --> 04:04:58.760 align:start position:0%
little mice turds all over the place and
 
04:05:02.030 --> 04:05:02.040 align:start position:0%
the Panic sets in what did they get into
 
04:05:05.149 --> 04:05:05.159 align:start position:0%
um see what was torn apart or where they
 
04:05:06.630 --> 04:05:06.640 align:start position:0%
were and then try and figure out where
 
04:05:09.590 --> 04:05:09.600 align:start position:0%
they came from
 
04:05:12.790 --> 04:05:12.800 align:start position:0%
um and um I've had I've had wraps as
 
04:05:14.950 --> 04:05:14.960 align:start position:0%
well that caused tremendous amount of
 
04:05:17.790 --> 04:05:17.800 align:start position:0%
damage in my home last year and I got a
 
04:05:19.349 --> 04:05:19.359 align:start position:0%
new kitchen out of
 
04:05:22.950 --> 04:05:22.960 align:start position:0%
it yeah but anyways
 
04:05:26.429 --> 04:05:26.439 align:start position:0%
um mice are a member of our food
 
04:05:30.590 --> 04:05:30.600 align:start position:0%
chain um you know other animals eat them
 
04:05:32.950 --> 04:05:32.960 align:start position:0%
and those and other animals eat those
 
04:05:36.309 --> 04:05:36.319 align:start position:0%
and somewhere along the line we may eat
 
04:05:39.389 --> 04:05:39.399 align:start position:0%
something that was ultimately where a
 
04:05:42.790 --> 04:05:42.800 align:start position:0%
mice a mouse was part of their their
 
04:05:42.800 --> 04:05:45.149 align:start position:0%
mice a mouse was part of their their
diet

04:05:45.149 --> 04:05:45.159 align:start position:0%
diet
 
04:05:48.349 --> 04:05:48.359 align:start position:0%
uh we for many of us especially uh those
 
04:05:51.349 --> 04:05:51.359 align:start position:0%
of us that have old homes we we usually
 
04:05:55.149 --> 04:05:55.159 align:start position:0%
experience some form of mice mouse or
 
04:05:57.550 --> 04:05:57.560 align:start position:0%
whatever running around the house and if
 
04:05:58.870 --> 04:05:58.880 align:start position:0%
you don't have a
 
04:06:02.309 --> 04:06:02.319 align:start position:0%
cat they continue to run around and you
 
04:06:06.750 --> 04:06:06.760 align:start position:0%
the the anxiety of okay I need to find a
 
04:06:10.070 --> 04:06:10.080 align:start position:0%
way to capture or kill this thing uh
 
04:06:11.469 --> 04:06:11.479 align:start position:0%
because I don't want it in my house it's
 
04:06:15.510 --> 04:06:15.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:17.830 --> 04:06:17.840 align:start position:0%
space in reality they're just hunting
 
04:06:17.840 --> 04:06:19.030 align:start position:0%
space in reality they're just hunting
for

04:06:19.030 --> 04:06:19.040 align:start position:0%
for
 
04:06:23.030 --> 04:06:23.040 align:start position:0%
food uh and um and they're looking for
 
04:06:25.590 --> 04:06:25.600 align:start position:0%
food pieces things of that that we
 
04:06:28.189 --> 04:06:28.199 align:start position:0%
normally eat and they're just trying to
 
04:06:30.670 --> 04:06:30.680 align:start position:0%
find them and they're rather destructive
 
04:06:35.870 --> 04:06:35.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:39.309 --> 04:06:39.319 align:start position:0%
them one method of cap capturing these
 
04:06:42.229 --> 04:06:42.239 align:start position:0%
mice has has been glue
 
04:06:46.309 --> 04:06:46.319 align:start position:0%
traps it's a very cruel way um to
 
04:06:49.710 --> 04:06:49.720 align:start position:0%
capture and kill um a rodent they get
 
04:06:52.149 --> 04:06:52.159 align:start position:0%
stuck in this thing
 
04:06:55.710 --> 04:06:55.720 align:start position:0%
and they starve they don't have any
 
04:06:58.110 --> 04:06:58.120 align:start position:0%
water uh some of the animals even chew
 
04:06:59.269 --> 04:06:59.279 align:start position:0%
their legs
 
04:07:03.590 --> 04:07:03.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:03.600 --> 04:07:05.550 align:start position:0%
 
gross

04:07:05.550 --> 04:07:05.560 align:start position:0%
gross
 
04:07:08.309 --> 04:07:08.319 align:start position:0%
uh for about a year and a half I worked
 
04:07:11.269 --> 04:07:11.279 align:start position:0%
for Community Action Partnership in do
 
04:07:13.550 --> 04:07:13.560 align:start position:0%
um all of straford County and we had a
 
04:07:16.469 --> 04:07:16.479 align:start position:0%
number of buildings and I was constantly
 
04:07:19.550 --> 04:07:19.560 align:start position:0%
uh looking for uh mice and rodents
 
04:07:22.630 --> 04:07:22.640 align:start position:0%
because we did have kitchens we fed kids
 
04:07:24.670 --> 04:07:24.680 align:start position:0%
and uh so we had to make sure that the
 
04:07:27.189 --> 04:07:27.199 align:start position:0%
rodent population was minimal especially
 
04:07:29.070 --> 04:07:29.080 align:start position:0%
when inspectors came
 
04:07:31.670 --> 04:07:31.680 align:start position:0%
around I I had one building that was
 
04:07:33.429 --> 04:07:33.439 align:start position:0%
especially bad it was an old home that
 
04:07:35.950 --> 04:07:35.960 align:start position:0%
had been converted into
 
04:07:40.510 --> 04:07:40.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:42.830 --> 04:07:42.840 align:start position:0%
I don't forget when they first had me go
 
04:07:46.550 --> 04:07:46.560 align:start position:0%
downstairs course was really creepy um
 
04:07:46.560 --> 04:07:48.229 align:start position:0%
downstairs course was really creepy um
and

04:07:48.229 --> 04:07:48.239 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:07:52.070 --> 04:07:52.080 align:start position:0%
um there were these traps set all over
 
04:07:55.469 --> 04:07:55.479 align:start position:0%
the place a pesticide company had come
 
04:08:00.750 --> 04:08:00.760 align:start position:0%
in and and put them in and um and so we
 
04:08:03.670 --> 04:08:03.680 align:start position:0%
called them and um they hadn't been out
 
04:08:05.710 --> 04:08:05.720 align:start position:0%
there in a while so they said well they
 
04:08:08.269 --> 04:08:08.279 align:start position:0%
wouldn't come and pick them up I was
 
04:08:09.870 --> 04:08:09.880 align:start position:0%
responsible for picking them up and
 
04:08:11.750 --> 04:08:11.760 align:start position:0%
taking care of
 
04:08:15.710 --> 04:08:15.720 align:start position:0%
them and I found about 20 of
 
04:08:20.670 --> 04:08:20.680 align:start position:0%
them in in some really odd spots too and
 
04:08:23.990 --> 04:08:24.000 align:start position:0%
some of them had like one mouse or two
 
04:08:25.510 --> 04:08:25.520 align:start position:0%
and the number of
 
04:08:28.349 --> 04:08:28.359 align:start position:0%
skeletons um there were a number
 
04:08:32.429 --> 04:08:32.439 align:start position:0%
of insects a lot of dirt and
 
04:08:37.670 --> 04:08:37.680 align:start position:0%
dust and um and it was it was just
 
04:08:39.630 --> 04:08:39.640 align:start position:0%
disgusting to have to pick these things
 
04:08:42.950 --> 04:08:42.960 align:start position:0%
up and and get rid of
 
04:08:42.960 --> 04:08:44.990 align:start position:0%
up and and get rid of
them

04:08:44.990 --> 04:08:45.000 align:start position:0%
them
 
04:08:48.189 --> 04:08:48.199 align:start position:0%
um we got another pesticide company come
 
04:08:51.189 --> 04:08:51.199 align:start position:0%
in to take a look at um ways to take
 
04:08:54.910 --> 04:08:54.920 align:start position:0%
care of them and um uh so they did a
 
04:08:56.590 --> 04:08:56.600 align:start position:0%
number of things and tried and catch it
 
04:08:58.990 --> 04:08:59.000 align:start position:0%
catch them and including
 
04:09:02.070 --> 04:09:02.080 align:start position:0%
ultrasonic um devices that they plugged
 
04:09:04.189 --> 04:09:04.199 align:start position:0%
in but they also put down
 
04:09:06.510 --> 04:09:06.520 align:start position:0%
more glue
 
04:09:09.830 --> 04:09:09.840 align:start position:0%
tabs and they never came to check on
 
04:09:12.429 --> 04:09:12.439 align:start position:0%
them or pick them up or anything it was
 
04:09:17.149 --> 04:09:17.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:17.159 --> 04:09:20.349 align:start position:0%
 
them

04:09:20.349 --> 04:09:20.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:23.590 --> 04:09:23.600 align:start position:0%
um it was very difficult for especially
 
04:09:25.269 --> 04:09:25.279 align:start position:0%
someone who really cares about animals
 
04:09:29.070 --> 04:09:29.080 align:start position:0%
to to see these small creatures um stuck
 
04:09:30.030 --> 04:09:30.040 align:start position:0%
in these
 
04:09:30.040 --> 04:09:31.550 align:start position:0%
in these
traps

04:09:31.550 --> 04:09:31.560 align:start position:0%
traps
 
04:09:34.510 --> 04:09:34.520 align:start position:0%
um although I'll tell you I've put a
 
04:09:37.229 --> 04:09:37.239 align:start position:0%
couple in my house and I was always
 
04:09:39.070 --> 04:09:39.080 align:start position:0%
worried at the time whether one one of
 
04:09:41.830 --> 04:09:41.840 align:start position:0%
my my dogs would find one and get stuck
 
04:09:43.269 --> 04:09:43.279 align:start position:0%
to it and then I was going to have to
 
04:09:45.790 --> 04:09:45.800 align:start position:0%
clean it off luckily I
 
04:09:48.790 --> 04:09:48.800 align:start position:0%
didn't and and all I got for the traps
 
04:09:51.469 --> 04:09:51.479 align:start position:0%
that I put there was was dust and
 
04:09:55.189 --> 04:09:55.199 align:start position:0%
dirt um I ended up putting uh the high
 
04:09:57.630 --> 04:09:57.640 align:start position:0%
frequency devices in my home that took
 
04:10:01.229 --> 04:10:01.239 align:start position:0%
care of many of them and then I put down
 
04:10:03.469 --> 04:10:03.479 align:start position:0%
these plastic boxes with u with
 
04:10:06.269 --> 04:10:06.279 align:start position:0%
chemicals inside and that took care of a
 
04:10:08.469 --> 04:10:08.479 align:start position:0%
few um
 
04:10:10.870 --> 04:10:10.880 align:start position:0%
and then I uh I had a rat problem I
 
04:10:13.269 --> 04:10:13.279 align:start position:0%
ended up with electronic traps and and
 
04:10:15.309 --> 04:10:15.319 align:start position:0%
have a heart trap and I got rid of those
 
04:10:15.319 --> 04:10:17.750 align:start position:0%
have a heart trap and I got rid of those
that

04:10:17.750 --> 04:10:17.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:19.670 --> 04:10:19.680 align:start position:0%
way in
 
04:10:23.109 --> 04:10:23.119 align:start position:0%
um in investigating uh this problem I
 
04:10:25.590 --> 04:10:25.600 align:start position:0%
found that there were uh a number of
 
04:10:28.309 --> 04:10:28.319 align:start position:0%
countries and many corporations who
 
04:10:30.510 --> 04:10:30.520 align:start position:0%
banned the use of these in their
 
04:10:34.229 --> 04:10:34.239 align:start position:0%
facilities and and
 
04:10:36.790 --> 04:10:36.800 align:start position:0%
um probably just for many of the same
 
04:10:38.590 --> 04:10:38.600 align:start position:0%
reasons as is that they had to have
 
04:10:40.590 --> 04:10:40.600 align:start position:0%
someone continually monitor them and
 
04:10:43.030 --> 04:10:43.040 align:start position:0%
capture them and get rid of the the
 
04:10:46.710 --> 04:10:46.720 align:start position:0%
creatures um and I uh I did find out
 
04:10:49.309 --> 04:10:49.319 align:start position:0%
there's a number of states that um are
 
04:10:52.670 --> 04:10:52.680 align:start position:0%
considering Banning these devices
 
04:10:56.870 --> 04:10:56.880 align:start position:0%
already um and but I also I also thought
 
04:10:59.710 --> 04:10:59.720 align:start position:0%
about um uh the people who sell these
 
04:11:02.469 --> 04:11:02.479 align:start position:0%
too I work for Home
 
04:11:05.710 --> 04:11:05.720 align:start position:0%
Depot and we sell them and when I asked
 
04:11:08.030 --> 04:11:08.040 align:start position:0%
about um how much it was going to cost
 
04:11:10.990 --> 04:11:11.000 align:start position:0%
the company for uh if we stop selling
 
04:11:13.149 --> 04:11:13.159 align:start position:0%
them and is it
 
04:11:15.070 --> 04:11:15.080 align:start position:0%
insignificant you we're on the Shelf
 
04:11:16.710 --> 04:11:16.720 align:start position:0%
along with everything else and we didn't
 
04:11:19.510 --> 04:11:19.520 align:start position:0%
sell a tremendous amount but so the cost
 
04:11:22.109 --> 04:11:22.119 align:start position:0%
for the company would be
 
04:11:25.189 --> 04:11:25.199 align:start position:0%
minimal so you're going to hear a lot
 
04:11:26.590 --> 04:11:26.600 align:start position:0%
more about these
 
04:11:29.590 --> 04:11:29.600 align:start position:0%
traps and um the challenges that people
 
04:11:31.229 --> 04:11:31.239 align:start position:0%
face with them in different places and
 
04:11:32.910 --> 04:11:32.920 align:start position:0%
what damage they
 
04:11:36.510 --> 04:11:36.520 align:start position:0%
cause and and um I'm going to urge you
 
04:11:41.429 --> 04:11:41.439 align:start position:0%
to vote ought to ought to pass this bill
 
04:11:44.070 --> 04:11:44.080 align:start position:0%
um so we ban them in the state for sale
 
04:11:47.269 --> 04:11:47.279 align:start position:0%
and and ultimately ban the use of
 
04:11:50.349 --> 04:11:50.359 align:start position:0%
them thank you and I'm open to questions
 
04:11:52.429 --> 04:11:52.439 align:start position:0%
and I'll answer them if I can but we are
 
04:11:54.149 --> 04:11:54.159 align:start position:0%
going to have
 
04:11:56.910 --> 04:11:56.920 align:start position:0%
experts any questions from the
 
04:11:59.510 --> 04:11:59.520 align:start position:0%

support of House Bill
 
04:12:34.229 --> 04:12:34.239 align:start position:0%
1351 um from my experience glue traps
 
04:12:37.750 --> 04:12:37.760 align:start position:0%
are extremely inhumane and and must be
 
04:12:40.109 --> 04:12:40.119 align:start position:0%
banned immediately uh there's absolutely
 
04:12:40.119 --> 04:12:41.070 align:start position:0%
banned immediately uh there's absolutely
no

04:12:41.070 --> 04:12:41.080 align:start position:0%
no
 
04:12:43.950 --> 04:12:43.960 align:start position:0%
justification for forcing animals to
 
04:12:46.630 --> 04:12:46.640 align:start position:0%
endure that much pain and suffering
 
04:12:49.469 --> 04:12:49.479 align:start position:0%
especially when there are so many more
 
04:12:52.189 --> 04:12:52.199 align:start position:0%
Humane and effective Alternatives
 
04:12:55.109 --> 04:12:55.119 align:start position:0%
available to us um last month my
 
04:12:57.469 --> 04:12:57.479 align:start position:0%
landlord handed me some glue traps to
 
04:12:59.510 --> 04:12:59.520 align:start position:0%
address the presence of mice in my
 
04:13:02.550 --> 04:13:02.560 align:start position:0%
building I declined to use them and
 
04:13:04.349 --> 04:13:04.359 align:start position:0%
instead suggested he consider more
 
04:13:08.030 --> 04:13:08.040 align:start position:0%
Humane options um animal caught in go
 
04:13:11.790 --> 04:13:11.800 align:start position:0%
traps experience painful deaths uh if
 
04:13:14.309 --> 04:13:14.319 align:start position:0%
you've never personally seen uh what go
 
04:13:17.590 --> 04:13:17.600 align:start position:0%
traps do to animals uh I urge you to
 
04:13:20.630 --> 04:13:20.640 align:start position:0%
look at photos or watch a video of an
 
04:13:23.830 --> 04:13:23.840 align:start position:0%
animal caught in one um if you do you'll
 
04:13:26.550 --> 04:13:26.560 align:start position:0%
see a terrified animal being killed
 
04:13:29.309 --> 04:13:29.319 align:start position:0%
slowly in one of the most horrible and
 
04:13:30.630 --> 04:13:30.640 align:start position:0%
violent ways
 
04:13:34.309 --> 04:13:34.319 align:start position:0%
imaginable um mice and rats who are most
 
04:13:37.229 --> 04:13:37.239 align:start position:0%
frequently the victims of glue traps uh
 
04:13:38.830 --> 04:13:38.840 align:start position:0%
they're intelligent sensitive and
 
04:13:42.030 --> 04:13:42.040 align:start position:0%
affectionate animals they may be small
 
04:13:43.870 --> 04:13:43.880 align:start position:0%
but they're capable of feeling Joy
 
04:13:46.990 --> 04:13:47.000 align:start position:0%
excitement pain fear just like the dogs
 
04:13:50.550 --> 04:13:50.560 align:start position:0%
and cats we call family we have an
 
04:13:53.510 --> 04:13:53.520 align:start position:0%
obligation to treat them humanely um
 
04:13:55.149 --> 04:13:55.159 align:start position:0%
whether the animal caught in the glue
 
04:13:58.309 --> 04:13:58.319 align:start position:0%
trap is a mouse a bird a lizard a
 
04:14:01.830 --> 04:14:01.840 align:start position:0%
squirrel that happens too no living
 
04:14:03.750 --> 04:14:03.760 align:start position:0%
being should ever be killed in such a
 
04:14:06.590 --> 04:14:06.600 align:start position:0%
cruel and barbaric way um I fully
 
04:14:08.670 --> 04:14:08.680 align:start position:0%
support ban on glue traps I hope that
 
04:14:11.149 --> 04:14:11.159 align:start position:0%
after hearing everyone's testimony today
 
04:14:13.189 --> 04:14:13.199 align:start position:0%

Jacob is going to distribute some
 
04:14:39.349 --> 04:14:39.359 align:start position:0%
written materials to you because it's a
 
04:14:42.750 --> 04:14:42.760 align:start position:0%
little difficult for me to balance with
 
04:15:01.429 --> 04:15:01.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:05.389 --> 04:15:05.399 align:start position:0%
but good afternoon good afternoon um my
 
04:15:07.750 --> 04:15:07.760 align:start position:0%
name is eug jeene slepian I live in
 
04:15:09.990 --> 04:15:10.000 align:start position:0%
Stoddard in chesher
 
04:15:15.149 --> 04:15:15.159 align:start position:0%
County um and I uh I first became aware
 
04:15:18.309 --> 04:15:18.319 align:start position:0%
of the problems with glue traps several
 
04:15:20.630 --> 04:15:20.640 align:start position:0%
years ago when I started following some
 
04:15:23.189 --> 04:15:23.199 align:start position:0%
of the Facebook posts of some of the
 
04:15:25.389 --> 04:15:25.399 align:start position:0%
Wildlife Rehabilitation
 
04:15:29.229 --> 04:15:29.239 align:start position:0%
hospitals and honestly I could not
 
04:15:32.030 --> 04:15:32.040 align:start position:0%
believe that these traps could possibly
 
04:15:35.710 --> 04:15:35.720 align:start position:0%
be legal because they were so extremely
 
04:15:38.990 --> 04:15:39.000 align:start position:0%
cruel um so I'm very very grateful to
 
04:15:41.510 --> 04:15:41.520 align:start position:0%
representative Canon for bringing this
 
04:15:42.790 --> 04:15:42.800 align:start position:0%
issue to the
 
04:15:45.189 --> 04:15:45.199 align:start position:0%
legislature and if I could I'd also like
 
04:15:47.269 --> 04:15:47.279 align:start position:0%
to take a moment to say how grateful I
 
04:15:49.710 --> 04:15:49.720 align:start position:0%
am to the people in the legislative
 
04:15:52.389 --> 04:15:52.399 align:start position:0%
Services office this year because I know
 
04:15:54.670 --> 04:15:54.680 align:start position:0%
they've been working night and day with
 
04:15:56.870 --> 04:15:56.880 align:start position:0%
the number of bills that they have and
 
04:15:59.550 --> 04:15:59.560 align:start position:0%
they did a very careful um and very
 
04:16:02.070 --> 04:16:02.080 align:start position:0%
thorough job with this bill and I'm very
 
04:16:03.349 --> 04:16:03.359 align:start position:0%
very very
 
04:16:06.149 --> 04:16:06.159 align:start position:0%
appreciative um so I I'll try to be very
 
04:16:06.159 --> 04:16:07.469 align:start position:0%
appreciative um so I I'll try to be very
concise

04:16:07.469 --> 04:16:07.479 align:start position:0%
concise
 
04:16:10.429 --> 04:16:10.439 align:start position:0%
um the US Centers for Disease Control
 
04:16:13.710 --> 04:16:13.720 align:start position:0%
and prevention says on their website do
 
04:16:16.910 --> 04:16:16.920 align:start position:0%
not use glue traps the reason for this
 
04:16:19.630 --> 04:16:19.640 align:start position:0%
is that as the animals die slowly on the
 
04:16:22.429 --> 04:16:22.439 align:start position:0%
traps they will continue to excrete
 
04:16:25.070 --> 04:16:25.080 align:start position:0%
bodily substances including blood
 
04:16:26.510 --> 04:16:26.520 align:start position:0%
because they often try to chew their
 
04:16:30.389 --> 04:16:30.399 align:start position:0%
limbs off and this can be a source of
 
04:16:33.630 --> 04:16:33.640 align:start position:0%
disease transmission um bacteria and
 
04:16:38.630 --> 04:16:38.640 align:start position:0%
viral infections hirus Le sporos
 
04:16:41.030 --> 04:16:41.040 align:start position:0%
salmonella and this is especially
 
04:16:44.269 --> 04:16:44.279 align:start position:0%
dangerous if there are uh young children
 
04:16:46.910 --> 04:16:46.920 align:start position:0%
or or companion animals in the
 
04:16:49.109 --> 04:16:49.119 align:start position:0%

publication of their non-game
 
04:16:59.109 --> 04:16:59.119 align:start position:0%
program um from the summer of
 
04:17:02.710 --> 04:17:02.720 align:start position:0%
2021 in that issue they said avoid the
 
04:17:04.149 --> 04:17:04.159 align:start position:0%
use of glue traps it's at the New
 
04:17:06.910 --> 04:17:06.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Fish and Game department avoid
 
04:17:08.630 --> 04:17:08.640 align:start position:0%
the use of glute traps because of the
 
04:17:11.269 --> 04:17:11.279 align:start position:0%
non-target animals that are often caught
 
04:17:11.279 --> 04:17:12.030 align:start position:0%
non-target animals that are often caught
and

04:17:12.030 --> 04:17:12.040 align:start position:0%

Turtles even even kittens puppies um
 
04:17:22.870 --> 04:17:22.880 align:start position:0%
they so the New Hampshire fishing game
 
04:17:24.389 --> 04:17:24.399 align:start position:0%
department has said avoid the use of
 
04:17:28.189 --> 04:17:28.199 align:start position:0%
glue traps the US fish and wildlife
 
04:17:31.269 --> 04:17:31.279 align:start position:0%
service in its publication for
 
04:17:34.389 --> 04:17:34.399 align:start position:0%
professional Wildlife Control operators
 
04:17:37.189 --> 04:17:37.199 align:start position:0%
um that are dealing with bat populations
 
04:17:39.189 --> 04:17:39.199 align:start position:0%
the US fish and wildlife service has
 
04:17:42.990 --> 04:17:43.000 align:start position:0%
said sticky traps are not
 
04:17:46.550 --> 04:17:46.560 align:start position:0%
acceptable to use in controlling bat
 
04:17:50.510 --> 04:17:50.520 align:start position:0%
populations um so we we really can't
 
04:17:53.870 --> 04:17:53.880 align:start position:0%
have people purchasing sticky traps to
 
04:17:55.870 --> 04:17:55.880 align:start position:0%
control bats and throwing them into the
 
04:17:59.750 --> 04:17:59.760 align:start position:0%
attic or the barn or the garage um New

Hampshire Fish and Game department says
 
04:18:04.229 --> 04:18:04.239 align:start position:0%
that there are eight species of bats in
 
04:18:07.229 --> 04:18:07.239 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and they are they're all
 
04:18:10.349 --> 04:18:10.359 align:start position:0%
of conservation concern so bats are a
 
04:18:14.030 --> 04:18:14.040 align:start position:0%
big issue in the use of sticky traps um
 
04:18:16.109 --> 04:18:16.119 align:start position:0%
the American Veterinary Medical
 
04:18:19.229 --> 04:18:19.239 align:start position:0%

the mo the most Humane option must be

Medical Association is opposed to the
 
04:18:55.309 --> 04:18:55.319 align:start position:0%
use of glue traps um and I did a survey
 
04:18:57.750 --> 04:18:57.760 align:start position:0%
and the results of the survey are are in
 
04:19:00.070 --> 04:19:00.080 align:start position:0%
your packets there so I hope you'll have
 
04:19:02.590 --> 04:19:02.600 align:start position:0%
an opportunity to take a look at them
 
04:19:07.710 --> 04:19:07.720 align:start position:0%
between August and October of two 202 23
 
04:19:11.630 --> 04:19:11.640 align:start position:0%
I did a survey of 20 professional
 
04:19:13.910 --> 04:19:13.920 align:start position:0%
wildlife control operator companies in
 
04:19:16.830 --> 04:19:16.840 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire um I got the names of
 
04:19:18.349 --> 04:19:18.359 align:start position:0%
these companies from looking at some of
 
04:19:19.630 --> 04:19:19.640 align:start position:0%
the national
 
04:19:22.070 --> 04:19:22.080 align:start position:0%
organizations and out of the 20
 
04:19:25.389 --> 04:19:25.399 align:start position:0%
companies 15 companies told me
 
04:19:28.670 --> 04:19:28.680 align:start position:0%
absolutely they do not use glut traps
 
04:19:30.950 --> 04:19:30.960 align:start position:0%
and if you look at some of the comments
 
04:19:33.710 --> 04:19:33.720 align:start position:0%
that they've made they're really quite
 
04:19:38.269 --> 04:19:38.279 align:start position:0%
emphatic about the cruelty of glue traps
 
04:19:41.389 --> 04:19:41.399 align:start position:0%
so 15 of the companies said they do not
 
04:19:44.870 --> 04:19:44.880 align:start position:0%
use glue traps 19 of the companies
 
04:19:47.870 --> 04:19:47.880 align:start position:0%
advertise on their websites Humane and
 
04:19:50.429 --> 04:19:50.439 align:start position:0%
ethical methods of wildlife
 
04:19:53.429 --> 04:19:53.439 align:start position:0%
control so I think that we can
 
04:19:53.439 --> 04:19:54.950 align:start position:0%
control so I think that we can
say

04:19:54.950 --> 04:19:54.960 align:start position:0%
say
 
04:19:57.229 --> 04:19:57.239 align:start position:0%
confidently that eliminating the use of
 
04:19:59.710 --> 04:19:59.720 align:start position:0%
glue traps especially because our bill
 
04:20:03.469 --> 04:20:03.479 align:start position:0%
gives them a year to come up to to to to
 
04:20:05.710 --> 04:20:05.720 align:start position:0%
fix this problem I think we can say
 
04:20:09.269 --> 04:20:09.279 align:start position:0%
confidently that this will not impact
 
04:20:12.349 --> 04:20:12.359 align:start position:0%
professional Wildlife Control operators
 
04:20:15.269 --> 04:20:15.279 align:start position:0%
adversely now two of the companies that
 
04:20:18.469 --> 04:20:18.479 align:start position:0%
I contacted and this information is also
 
04:20:20.590 --> 04:20:20.600 align:start position:0%
in the packet two of the companies said
 
04:20:23.710 --> 04:20:23.720 align:start position:0%
that they use small sticky traps for
 
04:20:27.030 --> 04:20:27.040 align:start position:0%
monitoring insect infestations and
 
04:20:32.229 --> 04:20:32.239 align:start position:0%
insect problems but our bill HP 1351 is
 
04:20:35.710 --> 04:20:35.720 align:start position:0%
is not about insects it specifically
 
04:20:38.910 --> 04:20:38.920 align:start position:0%
addresses the ISS issue of traps that
 
04:20:40.469 --> 04:20:40.479 align:start position:0%
are intended for
 
04:20:43.950 --> 04:20:43.960 align:start position:0%
rodents um so we're we're not talking
 
04:20:47.429 --> 04:20:47.439 align:start position:0%
about the very small traps or the fly
 
04:20:50.070 --> 04:20:50.080 align:start position:0%
paper that that would help with the the
 
04:20:57.109 --> 04:20:57.119 align:start position:0%
in insect problems um and and lastly um
 
04:21:00.309 --> 04:21:00.319 align:start position:0%
when when we passed the interstate
 
04:21:02.229 --> 04:21:02.239 align:start position:0%
Wildlife violators
 
04:21:04.830 --> 04:21:04.840 align:start position:0%
compact in
 
04:21:07.550 --> 04:21:07.560 align:start position:0%
2013 we said
 
04:21:11.389 --> 04:21:11.399 align:start position:0%
we we agreed we agreed that
 
04:21:14.590 --> 04:21:14.600 align:start position:0%
Wildlife is held in trust is managed in
 
04:21:16.790 --> 04:21:16.800 align:start position:0%
trust for the benefit of all of the
 
04:21:20.429 --> 04:21:20.439 align:start position:0%
citizens of the state and all visitors
 
04:21:24.149 --> 04:21:24.159 align:start position:0%
which means that the state as Trustee of
 
04:21:27.750 --> 04:21:27.760 align:start position:0%
Wildlife Resources has a statutory and
 
04:21:31.030 --> 04:21:31.040 align:start position:0%
an ethical obligation to protect
 
04:21:34.389 --> 04:21:34.399 align:start position:0%
Wildlife um from hazards and I would
 
04:21:37.750 --> 04:21:37.760 align:start position:0%
compare this to the prohibition on the
 
04:21:40.389 --> 04:21:40.399 align:start position:0%
use of lead fishing jigs and
 
04:21:44.269 --> 04:21:44.279 align:start position:0%
sinkers um and that bill was passed in
 
04:21:47.550 --> 04:21:47.560 align:start position:0%
1998 and the intent of that
 
04:21:51.590 --> 04:21:51.600 align:start position:0%
bill was to prevent the death of water
 
04:21:54.550 --> 04:21:54.560 align:start position:0%
fowl who were affected by the lead
 
04:21:57.510 --> 04:21:57.520 align:start position:0%
fishing J Jigs and sinkers uh especially
 
04:22:00.229 --> 04:22:00.239 align:start position:0%
loons they found a huge
 
04:22:02.670 --> 04:22:02.680 align:start position:0%
problem with the death of loons from
 
04:22:04.790 --> 04:22:04.800 align:start position:0%
lead poisoning and the sponsor of that
 
04:22:07.469 --> 04:22:07.479 align:start position:0%
bill was Senator Jeb Bradley when he was
 
04:22:09.389 --> 04:22:09.399 align:start position:0%
in the House of
 
04:22:09.399 --> 04:22:11.309 align:start position:0%
in the House of
Representatives

04:22:11.309 --> 04:22:11.319 align:start position:0%
Representatives
 
04:22:14.149 --> 04:22:14.159 align:start position:0%
so I think there are also many many many
 
04:22:16.670 --> 04:22:16.680 align:start position:0%
options and I think some of the other
 
04:22:18.109 --> 04:22:18.119 align:start position:0%
people here are going to discuss some of
 
04:22:21.870 --> 04:22:21.880 align:start position:0%
the other options there are snap traps
 
04:22:24.830 --> 04:22:24.840 align:start position:0%
electric traps Catch and Release traps
 
04:22:26.910 --> 04:22:26.920 align:start position:0%
there are natural repellants like
 
04:22:31.149 --> 04:22:31.159 align:start position:0%
peppermint um cayenne pepper uh cloes
 
04:22:33.389 --> 04:22:33.399 align:start position:0%
there are a wide variety of commercial
 
04:22:36.590 --> 04:22:36.600 align:start position:0%
products that can be used for repellants
 
04:22:36.600 --> 04:22:37.950 align:start position:0%
products that can be used for repellants
there's

04:22:37.950 --> 04:22:37.960 align:start position:0%
there's
 
04:22:41.910 --> 04:22:41.920 align:start position:0%
um plug plugging up the the uh the
 
04:22:43.710 --> 04:22:43.720 align:start position:0%
places where the medicine rats are
 
04:22:46.910 --> 04:22:46.920 align:start position:0%
getting into the house there's covering
 
04:22:49.630 --> 04:22:49.640 align:start position:0%
food uh removing food sources covering
 
04:22:54.510 --> 04:22:54.520 align:start position:0%
garbage cans and then my favorite option
 
04:22:56.269 --> 04:22:56.279 align:start position:0%
to go to the local animal shelter and
 
04:22:57.670 --> 04:22:57.680 align:start position:0%
adopt a couple of
 
04:23:02.389 --> 04:23:02.399 align:start position:0%
cats um so uh I'd be happy to answer any
 
04:23:05.269 --> 04:23:05.279 align:start position:0%
questions and I thank you for your
 
04:23:07.469 --> 04:23:07.479 align:start position:0%
attention any questions from the
 
04:23:10.389 --> 04:23:10.399 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none thank you for your
 
04:23:15.469 --> 04:23:15.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:17.710 --> 04:23:17.720 align:start position:0%
wall I don't want to bump into you here
 
04:23:27.469 --> 04:23:27.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:29.990 --> 04:23:30.000 align:start position:0%
you're hi my name is spej while I'm live
 
04:23:31.870 --> 04:23:31.880 align:start position:0%
in Sullivan which is also in Chester
 
04:23:35.469 --> 04:23:35.479 align:start position:0%
County near Kean um I've come often to
 
04:23:38.070 --> 04:23:38.080 align:start position:0%
conquer to speak on various bills most
 
04:23:40.429 --> 04:23:40.439 align:start position:0%
of them having to do with being kind to
 
04:23:43.790 --> 04:23:43.800 align:start position:0%
animals or being kinder to animals as
 
04:23:47.389 --> 04:23:47.399 align:start position:0%
this one is and they're always it every
 
04:23:49.790 --> 04:23:49.800 align:start position:0%
single one never one anything and I just
 
04:23:52.830 --> 04:23:52.840 align:start position:0%
really hope that maybe this time you
 
04:23:55.109 --> 04:23:55.119 align:start position:0%
guys will listen and please pass this
 
04:23:57.149 --> 04:23:57.159 align:start position:0%
bill because the use of glue traps is
 
04:24:00.910 --> 04:24:00.920 align:start position:0%
totally unnecessary I actually BR a trap
 
04:24:02.910 --> 04:24:02.920 align:start position:0%
we use these in our house cuz even
 
04:24:04.990 --> 04:24:05.000 align:start position:0%
though we have five cats we have a Mouse
 
04:24:08.389 --> 04:24:08.399 align:start position:0%
a mouse inest basement that um and these
 
04:24:09.950 --> 04:24:09.960 align:start position:0%
are great because you catch them and you
 
04:24:11.510 --> 04:24:11.520 align:start position:0%
just take them somewhere and release
 
04:24:13.189 --> 04:24:13.199 align:start position:0%
them at least that gives them a fighting
 
04:24:14.630 --> 04:24:14.640 align:start position:0%
chance for
 
04:24:17.630 --> 04:24:17.640 align:start position:0%
survival um but lots of people
 
04:24:20.229 --> 04:24:20.239 align:start position:0%
apparently do use gluc caps and I really
 
04:24:22.469 --> 04:24:22.479 align:start position:0%
can't understand why they would but it
 
04:24:24.870 --> 04:24:24.880 align:start position:0%
often has the unintended consequence as
 
04:24:27.189 --> 04:24:27.199 align:start position:0%
Jean said of catching song birds which
 
04:24:29.750 --> 04:24:29.760 align:start position:0%
has a declining population at the moment
 
04:24:32.790 --> 04:24:32.800 align:start position:0%
Chipmunks kittens they had to euthanize
 
04:24:34.790 --> 04:24:34.800 align:start position:0%
a cat because it got caught in more than
 
04:24:36.910 --> 04:24:36.920 align:start position:0%
one glue trap and it's really hard to
 
04:24:39.189 --> 04:24:39.199 align:start position:0%
get them off of a glue trap it's it's
 
04:24:42.830 --> 04:24:42.840 align:start position:0%
nearly impossible their skin gets ripped
 
04:24:45.229 --> 04:24:45.239 align:start position:0%
they themselves try
 
04:24:47.870 --> 04:24:47.880 align:start position:0%
to GW off their own
 
04:24:47.880 --> 04:24:49.710 align:start position:0%
to GW off their own
limbs

04:24:49.710 --> 04:24:49.720 align:start position:0%
limbs
 
04:24:52.630 --> 04:24:52.640 align:start position:0%
um but even if it only caught mice I
 
04:24:54.670 --> 04:24:54.680 align:start position:0%
feel it still should be outlawed it's
 
04:24:57.309 --> 04:24:57.319 align:start position:0%
just so cruel and there is a similar
 
04:25:00.109 --> 04:25:00.119 align:start position:0%
bill in the US House at the moment I'm
 
04:25:02.590 --> 04:25:02.600 align:start position:0%
hoping that passes but I don't think
 
04:25:04.269 --> 04:25:04.279 align:start position:0%
that the state of New Hampshire should
 
04:25:06.710 --> 04:25:06.720 align:start position:0%
wait for the US House to pass this bill
 
04:25:09.830 --> 04:25:09.840 align:start position:0%
I think we should be leaders in this and
 
04:25:11.469 --> 04:25:11.479 align:start position:0%
uh I hope you do the right thing and
 
04:25:14.510 --> 04:25:14.520 align:start position:0%
support this bill thanks any questions

you adhesive based rodent traps also
 
04:26:13.349 --> 04:26:13.359 align:start position:0%
known as glue traps are cruel and
 
04:26:15.990 --> 04:26:16.000 align:start position:0%
indiscriminate and probably responsible
 
04:26:18.189 --> 04:26:18.199 align:start position:0%
for more suffering than any other

beloved family pet
 
04:26:38.990 --> 04:26:39.000 align:start position:0%
can be caught in the Trap and suffer a

slow death by S starvation or

Suffocation in
 
04:26:48.710 --> 04:26:48.720 align:start position:0%
20123 I removed four mice three phoebes
 
04:26:51.790 --> 04:26:51.800 align:start position:0%
and four sparrows from glue traps the
 
04:26:55.389 --> 04:26:55.399 align:start position:0%
animals suffered broken bones dislocated
 
04:26:58.630 --> 04:26:58.640 align:start position:0%
joints loss of feathers or fur because
 
04:27:01.429 --> 04:27:01.439 align:start position:0%
these animals were attempting to free
 
04:27:04.109 --> 04:27:04.119 align:start position:0%
themselves from the glue
 
04:27:07.469 --> 04:27:07.479 align:start position:0%
traps so far this here I removed a bat
 
04:27:09.870 --> 04:27:09.880 align:start position:0%
from a glue trap these animals were
 
04:27:12.510 --> 04:27:12.520 align:start position:0%
brought to me by individuals that
 
04:27:16.830 --> 04:27:16.840 align:start position:0%
purchased them um to use the glue
 
04:27:20.149 --> 04:27:20.159 align:start position:0%
trap these individuals saw the animal
 
04:27:23.109 --> 04:27:23.119 align:start position:0%
struggling in the glue trap and realized
 
04:27:26.910 --> 04:27:26.920 align:start position:0%
that it was a cruel and inhumane way for
 
04:27:29.229 --> 04:27:29.239 align:start position:0%
the animal to die this is what these
 
04:27:32.510 --> 04:27:32.520 align:start position:0%
people said to me I know it's here say
 
04:27:34.710 --> 04:27:34.720 align:start position:0%
okay but you know
 
04:27:37.189 --> 04:27:37.199 align:start position:0%
um as as far as I'm concerned they're
 
04:27:39.750 --> 04:27:39.760 align:start position:0%
right it was cruel and
 
04:27:42.870 --> 04:27:42.880 align:start position:0%
inhumane they reached out to save the
 
04:27:45.229 --> 04:27:45.239 align:start position:0%
animal from such a cruel death
 
04:27:48.109 --> 04:27:48.119 align:start position:0%
unfortunately there were too much damage
 
04:27:50.030 --> 04:27:50.040 align:start position:0%
that was caused due to the animal
 
04:27:52.590 --> 04:27:52.600 align:start position:0%
struggling to be free most of these
 
04:27:55.590 --> 04:27:55.600 align:start position:0%
animals had I had to euthanize
 
04:27:59.030 --> 04:27:59.040 align:start position:0%
them Humane Alternatives exist animal
 
04:28:02.030 --> 04:28:02.040 align:start position:0%
cruelty laws do exist in New Hampshire
 
04:28:04.510 --> 04:28:04.520 align:start position:0%
it's time that New Hampshire legislation
 
04:28:07.910 --> 04:28:07.920 align:start position:0%
prohibits a sale in use of glue traps to
 
04:28:12.189 --> 04:28:12.199 align:start position:0%
stop this cruelty if house bills 1231
 
04:28:14.030 --> 04:28:14.040 align:start position:0%
passes New Hampshire retailers
 
04:28:17.349 --> 04:28:17.359 align:start position:0%
Distributors exterminators manufacturers

comprehensive approach to addressing
 
04:31:30.590 --> 04:31:30.600 align:start position:0%
this issue rather than to legislate only
 
04:31:33.189 --> 04:31:33.199 align:start position:0%
single approaches in the El in the
 
04:31:35.630 --> 04:31:35.640 align:start position:0%
isolation from the big picture well
 
04:31:38.950 --> 04:31:38.960 align:start position:0%
appreciate the U the committee and as I
 
04:31:40.429 --> 04:31:40.439 align:start position:0%
mentioned I've been a wildlife biologist
 
04:31:42.149 --> 04:31:42.159 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire and I have good news
 
04:31:44.309 --> 04:31:44.319 align:start position:0%
you know we when I I was the first bear
 
04:31:47.189 --> 04:31:47.199 align:start position:0%
biologist beginning in the 70s and uh
 
04:31:49.149 --> 04:31:49.159 align:start position:0%
there were a thousand Bears when I first
 
04:31:51.030 --> 04:31:51.040 align:start position:0%
determined in the 80s and now we have
 
04:31:55.550 --> 04:31:55.560 align:start position:0%
over 6,000 Bears over 109 bald eagle
 
04:31:59.550 --> 04:31:59.560 align:start position:0%
pears more deer than you can imagine and
 
04:32:01.910 --> 04:32:01.920 align:start position:0%
most of our fishing wfe in New Hampshire
 
04:32:04.790 --> 04:32:04.800 align:start position:0%
has thrived during my 50-year career and
 
04:32:06.349 --> 04:32:06.359 align:start position:0%
it's been such a wonderful thing to
 
04:32:09.349 --> 04:32:09.359 align:start position:0%
watch the you know from no Eagles to 100
 
04:32:12.189 --> 04:32:12.199 align:start position:0%
pairs of eagles and Ospreys for but less
 
04:32:15.389 --> 04:32:15.399 align:start position:0%
than 10 to 200 pairs today what has been
 
04:32:17.550 --> 04:32:17.560 align:start position:0%
affected the most the last several
 
04:32:20.910 --> 04:32:20.920 align:start position:0%
decades it's our reptiles and amphibians
 
04:32:22.950 --> 04:32:22.960 align:start position:0%
and passing Birds the birds we love to
 
04:32:26.389 --> 04:32:26.399 align:start position:0%
see so these traps are you non-
 
04:32:28.670 --> 04:32:28.680 align:start position:0%
selective they you know where does a a
 
04:32:30.670 --> 04:32:30.680 align:start position:0%
frog or a snake want to hide out in the
 
04:32:32.950 --> 04:32:32.960 align:start position:0%
in the recesses where these glue traps
 
04:32:35.590 --> 04:32:35.600 align:start position:0%
are placed for rodents so they were a
 
04:32:38.109 --> 04:32:38.119 align:start position:0%
double whammy and when you eliminate the
 
04:32:39.870 --> 04:32:39.880 align:start position:0%
snakes around your property you're
 
04:32:41.990 --> 04:32:42.000 align:start position:0%
eliminating the patrol who's out there
 
04:32:44.670 --> 04:32:44.680 align:start position:0%
taking care of these rodents the natural
 
04:32:47.189 --> 04:32:47.199 align:start position:0%
way so these traps are very
 
04:32:49.429 --> 04:32:49.439 align:start position:0%
non-selective and that is why New
 
04:32:51.870 --> 04:32:51.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire aabon is here to support this
 
04:32:54.189 --> 04:32:54.199 align:start position:0%
bill today thank you very much thank you
 
04:32:56.830 --> 04:32:56.840 align:start position:0%
sir and thank you for your your work in
 
04:32:59.910 --> 04:32:59.920 align:start position:0%
this very important area of um helping
 
04:33:02.630 --> 04:33:02.640 align:start position:0%
our Wildlife any other questions from
 
04:33:04.990 --> 04:33:05.000 align:start position:0%
the committee representative Bixby yeah
 
04:33:10.070 --> 04:33:10.080 align:start position:0%
so um you said that uh that that there
 
04:33:12.590 --> 04:33:12.600 align:start position:0%
needs to be a sort of a more uh
 
04:33:13.990 --> 04:33:14.000 align:start position:0%
comprehensive approach are you
 
04:33:16.670 --> 04:33:16.680 align:start position:0%
suggesting that this bill needs to be
 
04:33:18.949 --> 04:33:18.959 align:start position:0%
amended in some way or is this would is
 
04:33:21.590 --> 04:33:21.600 align:start position:0%
this bill good as it is and then uh uh
 
04:33:24.109 --> 04:33:24.119 align:start position:0%
further further refinements could be
 
04:33:26.109 --> 04:33:26.119 align:start position:0%
done with other legislation well
 
04:33:28.629 --> 04:33:28.639 align:start position:0%
certainly uh based on my testimony there
 
04:33:30.551 --> 04:33:30.561 align:start position:0%
are certainly probably some options that
 
04:33:34.269 --> 04:33:34.279 align:start position:0%
could be looked at uh what those are I
 
04:33:35.629 --> 04:33:35.639 align:start position:0%
can't tell you that I'm an exper expert
 
04:33:38.949 --> 04:33:38.959 align:start position:0%
in rodent control uh I can catch bears
 
04:33:41.590 --> 04:33:41.600 align:start position:0%
but uh I'm not as good at catching rats
 
04:33:45.189 --> 04:33:45.199 align:start position:0%
and mice I guess havn't had to do that
 
04:33:46.510 --> 04:33:46.520 align:start position:0%
and you wouldn't use a glue trap for a
 
04:33:48.869 --> 04:33:48.879 align:start position:0%
bear I I do
 
04:33:51.400 --> 04:33:51.410 align:start position:0%
not and if I did I would call
 
04:33:51.410 --> 04:33:54.029 align:start position:0%
not and if I did I would call
[Laughter]

04:33:54.029 --> 04:33:54.039 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
04:33:57.109 --> 04:33:57.119 align:start position:0%
you any other questions seeing none
 
04:33:59.709 --> 04:33:59.719 align:start position:0%
thank you so much for joining us today
 
04:34:02.869 --> 04:34:02.879 align:start position:0%
and I call Dr William trenle and again
 
04:34:05.789 --> 04:34:05.799 align:start position:0%
please I remind people if we've heard um
 
04:34:09.349 --> 04:34:09.359 align:start position:0%
a point being brought up
 
04:34:13.429 --> 04:34:13.439 align:start position:0%
before then um uh please do not repeat
 
04:34:16.029 --> 04:34:16.039 align:start position:0%
it um we do have limited time for
 
04:34:19.949 --> 04:34:19.959 align:start position:0%
hearing today so go ahead welcome years
 
04:34:22.590 --> 04:34:22.600 align:start position:0%
ago um walking around in my
 
04:34:26.150 --> 04:34:26.160 align:start position:0%
backyard uh they're deer flies and they
 
04:34:28.750 --> 04:34:28.760 align:start position:0%
start attacking your face and they're a
 
04:34:32.670 --> 04:34:32.680 align:start position:0%
nuisance and one day I I went to a store
 
04:34:36.429 --> 04:34:36.439 align:start position:0%
and I saw a uh deerfly tap tape which is
 
04:34:38.590 --> 04:34:38.600 align:start position:0%
a variation of these glue traps and and
 
04:34:40.510 --> 04:34:40.520 align:start position:0%
so I tried it you affix it to the back
 
04:34:42.750 --> 04:34:42.760 align:start position:0%
of your hat and then the there's an
 
04:34:45.070 --> 04:34:45.080 align:start position:0%
adhesive side that these deer flies are
 
04:34:47.990 --> 04:34:48.000 align:start position:0%
attracted to and they they can stick to
 
04:34:50.429 --> 04:34:50.439 align:start position:0%
it but they don't come to your face
 
04:34:53.230 --> 04:34:53.240 align:start position:0%
which is the good thing and
 
04:34:56.029 --> 04:34:56.039 align:start position:0%
um at the end of the day walking around
 
04:34:58.070 --> 04:34:58.080 align:start position:0%
in my yard I'd come back take my ball
 
04:35:01.830 --> 04:35:01.840 align:start position:0%
cap off put it down and you'd see about
 
04:35:05.269 --> 04:35:05.279 align:start position:0%
six of these flies affixed to that
 
04:35:08.709 --> 04:35:08.719 align:start position:0%
trapped in in the glue and um I would
 
04:35:10.310 --> 04:35:10.320 align:start position:0%
just put it on the side and leave it
 
04:35:12.789 --> 04:35:12.799 align:start position:0%
there and then the next day go out again
 
04:35:14.629 --> 04:35:14.639 align:start position:0%
and put the Hat on of course these
 
04:35:18.029 --> 04:35:18.039 align:start position:0%
animals would be just sitting there and
 
04:35:19.789 --> 04:35:19.799 align:start position:0%
uh they they would die
 
04:35:23.349 --> 04:35:23.359 align:start position:0%
eventually um and over time I I I I
 
04:35:24.830 --> 04:35:24.840 align:start position:0%
started learning a little bit more about
 
04:35:28.470 --> 04:35:28.480 align:start position:0%
how we treat animals and um I became a
 
04:35:30.590 --> 04:35:30.600 align:start position:0%
little concerned about this and I I
 
04:35:32.470 --> 04:35:32.480 align:start position:0%
looked at it and I said something's not
 
04:35:35.269 --> 04:35:35.279 align:start position:0%
right about that and I even found myself
 
04:35:37.230 --> 04:35:37.240 align:start position:0%
trying to free them from the tape I
 
04:35:38.910 --> 04:35:38.920 align:start position:0%
would pluck them off of there and many
 
04:35:40.629 --> 04:35:40.639 align:start position:0%
of them actually survived I don't know
 
04:35:42.269 --> 04:35:42.279 align:start position:0%
how much trauma they had but they would
 
04:35:44.869 --> 04:35:44.879 align:start position:0%
fly off
 
04:35:48.670 --> 04:35:48.680 align:start position:0%
um and um but eventually I just gave it
 
04:35:50.349 --> 04:35:50.359 align:start position:0%
up all together and I I said you know
 
04:35:51.551 --> 04:35:51.561 align:start position:0%
what I'm going to try something
 
04:35:54.910 --> 04:35:54.920 align:start position:0%
different here I I got a piece of duct
 
04:35:58.070 --> 04:35:58.080 align:start position:0%
tape and I taped that to the back of my
 
04:36:02.109 --> 04:36:02.119 align:start position:0%
hat instead and so magically when I was
 
04:36:03.869 --> 04:36:03.879 align:start position:0%
walking around in the backyard the deer
 
04:36:06.230 --> 04:36:06.240 align:start position:0%
flies were attracted to that tape but
 
04:36:08.590 --> 04:36:08.600 align:start position:0%
there's no adhesive on on it because
 
04:36:11.429 --> 04:36:11.439 align:start position:0%
it's not a you know the adhesive side is
 
04:36:14.269 --> 04:36:14.279 align:start position:0%
a fix to the hat but they didn't come
 
04:36:17.390 --> 04:36:17.400 align:start position:0%
into my face and uh so I thought that
 
04:36:19.709 --> 04:36:19.719 align:start position:0%
was pretty neat and I even experimented
 
04:36:24.910 --> 04:36:24.920 align:start position:0%
and I um I tried a hat walking in in the
 
04:36:27.269 --> 04:36:27.279 align:start position:0%
yard without the tape without the duct
 
04:36:28.949 --> 04:36:28.959 align:start position:0%
tape on there and sure enough they were
 
04:36:33.109 --> 04:36:33.119 align:start position:0%
back in my face again but um the bottom
 
04:36:35.150 --> 04:36:35.160 align:start position:0%
line is what I'm trying to get at here
 
04:36:37.830 --> 04:36:37.840 align:start position:0%
is I'm just trying to say that there
 
04:36:39.230 --> 04:36:39.240 align:start position:0%
there is
 
04:36:41.789 --> 04:36:41.799 align:start position:0%
um there's usually an
 
04:36:44.869 --> 04:36:44.879 align:start position:0%
alternative and and a Kinder
 
04:36:48.230 --> 04:36:48.240 align:start position:0%
alternative if we care and and that's
 
04:36:51.189 --> 04:36:51.199 align:start position:0%
all I wanted to say um so thank you for
 
04:36:54.150 --> 04:36:54.160 align:start position:0%
your time thank you questions from the
 
04:37:03.990 --> 04:37:04.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:04.000 --> 04:37:26.070 align:start position:0%

04:37:26.070 --> 04:37:26.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:27.590 --> 04:37:27.600 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Madam chair and members
 
04:37:29.789 --> 04:37:29.799 align:start position:0%
of the committee my name is Jacob Shaw
 
04:37:31.869 --> 04:37:31.879 align:start position:0%
and I'm here on behalf of people for the
 
04:37:33.470 --> 04:37:33.480 align:start position:0%
ethical treatment of animals and our
 
04:37:35.910 --> 04:37:35.920 align:start position:0%
more than 31,000 members and supporters
 
04:37:38.390 --> 04:37:38.400 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire to express our strong
 
04:37:40.510 --> 04:37:40.520 align:start position:0%
support for HP
 
04:37:42.949 --> 04:37:42.959 align:start position:0%
1351 as you've heard today glue traps
 
04:37:45.109 --> 04:37:45.119 align:start position:0%
are indiscriminate killing devices that
 
04:37:47.551 --> 04:37:47.561 align:start position:0%
permanently disable injure and kill
 
04:37:50.510 --> 04:37:50.520 align:start position:0%
countless small animals every single
 
04:37:53.429 --> 04:37:53.439 align:start position:0%
year you I will skip over some of this
 
04:37:54.470 --> 04:37:54.480 align:start position:0%
because you know you've heard it from
 
04:37:56.269 --> 04:37:56.279 align:start position:0%
other people but to just put some
 
04:37:58.629 --> 04:37:58.639 align:start position:0%
numbers behind some of what we've talked
 
04:38:00.949 --> 04:38:00.959 align:start position:0%
about with other species of wildlife
 
04:38:03.590 --> 04:38:03.600 align:start position:0%
being caught in glue traps um our
 
04:38:05.470 --> 04:38:05.480 align:start position:0%
submitted testimony includes a letter
 
04:38:07.990 --> 04:38:08.000 align:start position:0%
from Edward Clark who oversees the wild
 
04:38:11.551 --> 04:38:11.561 align:start position:0%
one database which collects and verifies
 
04:38:13.510 --> 04:38:13.520 align:start position:0%
patient admission information from
 
04:38:16.150 --> 04:38:16.160 align:start position:0%
Wildlife Care centers around the country
 
04:38:18.750 --> 04:38:18.760 align:start position:0%
and as you'll see in the letter and the
 
04:38:20.349 --> 04:38:20.359 align:start position:0%
data set
 
04:38:24.429 --> 04:38:24.439 align:start position:0%
attached um more than or 180 species of
 
04:38:27.310 --> 04:38:27.320 align:start position:0%
wildlife including dozens of species of
 
04:38:31.230 --> 04:38:31.240 align:start position:0%
birds bats Chipmunks lizards mice AP
 
04:38:33.269 --> 04:38:33.279 align:start position:0%
possums rabbits salamanders snakes
 
04:38:35.269 --> 04:38:35.279 align:start position:0%
Turtles and even flying squirrels have
 
04:38:37.150 --> 04:38:37.160 align:start position:0%
been caught in glue traps and were
 
04:38:38.830 --> 04:38:38.840 align:start position:0%
brought to animal hospitals in need of
 
04:38:40.629 --> 04:38:40.639 align:start position:0%
life-saving care and you know in
 
04:38:43.109 --> 04:38:43.119 align:start position:0%
addition to Maria a number of other
 
04:38:45.789 --> 04:38:45.799 align:start position:0%
wildlife rehabilitators in the State uh
 
04:38:48.910 --> 04:38:48.920 align:start position:0%
including Deb go Franny Greenberg Joyce
 
04:38:50.990 --> 04:38:51.000 align:start position:0%
beamus and Susan Smith have all
 
04:38:52.990 --> 04:38:53.000 align:start position:0%
indicated their support for this bill
 
04:38:55.029 --> 04:38:55.039 align:start position:0%
because you know they see and treat
 
04:38:56.910 --> 04:38:56.920 align:start position:0%
animals who are cotton glue traps
 
04:38:58.349 --> 04:38:58.359 align:start position:0%
they've seen this up close and they know
 
04:39:00.109 --> 04:39:00.119 align:start position:0%
the consequences of the use of glue
 
04:39:04.629 --> 04:39:04.639 align:start position:0%
traps um but it's worth noting that all
 
04:39:06.470 --> 04:39:06.480 align:start position:0%
of these numbers only represent the
 
04:39:08.150 --> 04:39:08.160 align:start position:0%
animals who are actually brought to
 
04:39:10.310 --> 04:39:10.320 align:start position:0%
Wildlife Care Centers what's most
 
04:39:12.070 --> 04:39:12.080 align:start position:0%
horrifying about glut traps is that the
 
04:39:13.789 --> 04:39:13.799 align:start position:0%
vast majority of animals who are caught
 
04:39:16.230 --> 04:39:16.240 align:start position:0%
in them are never even taken to an
 
04:39:18.150 --> 04:39:18.160 align:start position:0%
animal hospital or a wildlife
 
04:39:20.709 --> 04:39:20.719 align:start position:0%
rehabilitator they are left to suffer
 
04:39:23.670 --> 04:39:23.680 align:start position:0%
excruciatingly painful deaths and after
 
04:39:26.070 --> 04:39:26.080 align:start position:0%
their paws Tails snouts and beaks get
 
04:39:28.869 --> 04:39:28.879 align:start position:0%
stuck to the glue many animals suffer
 
04:39:32.510 --> 04:39:32.520 align:start position:0%
for days and they die slowly and
 
04:39:35.670 --> 04:39:35.680 align:start position:0%
painfully from starvation dehy hydration
 
04:39:38.590 --> 04:39:38.600 align:start position:0%
blood loss and asphixiation their eyes
 
04:39:41.230 --> 04:39:41.240 align:start position:0%
and their mouths can become glued shut
 
04:39:43.110 --> 04:39:43.120 align:start position:0%
and as they struggle to escape from the
 
04:39:44.990 --> 04:39:45.000 align:start position:0%
traps they just become even more insens
 
04:39:47.590 --> 04:39:47.600 align:start position:0%
snared and the glue tears off chunks of
 
04:39:49.830 --> 04:39:49.840 align:start position:0%
their fur feathers or
 
04:39:53.070 --> 04:39:53.080 align:start position:0%
skin the manufacturers of these traps
 
04:39:55.030 --> 04:39:55.040 align:start position:0%
actually instruct users to throw the
 
04:39:57.310 --> 04:39:57.320 align:start position:0%
traps in the garbage even if the animal
 
04:40:00.070 --> 04:40:00.080 align:start position:0%
caught on the Trap is still alive and
 
04:40:01.470 --> 04:40:01.480 align:start position:0%
when people are confronted with an
 
04:40:04.190 --> 04:40:04.200 align:start position:0%
animal caught to a glue trap thrashing
 
04:40:07.470 --> 04:40:07.480 align:start position:0%
in pain or crying in agony they panic
 
04:40:08.868 --> 04:40:08.878 align:start position:0%
because they don't know what to do with
 
04:40:11.270 --> 04:40:11.280 align:start position:0%
a trapped animal you know some people
 
04:40:13.350 --> 04:40:13.360 align:start position:0%
may try to help the terrified animal but
 
04:40:15.510 --> 04:40:15.520 align:start position:0%
others have reported drowning trapped
 
04:40:17.270 --> 04:40:17.280 align:start position:0%
animals or even bludgeoning them to
 
04:40:19.310 --> 04:40:19.320 align:start position:0%
death and I apologize for you know the
 
04:40:21.110 --> 04:40:21.120 align:start position:0%
graphic detail but it's just part of the
 
04:40:22.750 --> 04:40:22.760 align:start position:0%
nature of what's being discussed
 
04:40:25.510 --> 04:40:25.520 align:start position:0%
obviously um you know for more than 20
 
04:40:28.070 --> 04:40:28.080 align:start position:0%
years Peta has operated a 24-hour
 
04:40:30.190 --> 04:40:30.200 align:start position:0%
emergency response hotline across the
 
04:40:33.470 --> 04:40:33.480 align:start position:0%
country and every single year we receive
 
04:40:36.150 --> 04:40:36.160 align:start position:0%
dozens of frantic reports of animals ens
 
04:40:38.868 --> 04:40:38.878 align:start position:0%
snared in these traps and many of our
 
04:40:40.868 --> 04:40:40.878 align:start position:0%
callers actually set the traps
 
04:40:43.310 --> 04:40:43.320 align:start position:0%
themselves not knowing what to expect
 
04:40:45.550 --> 04:40:45.560 align:start position:0%
and after seeing the horrors of what
 
04:40:47.628 --> 04:40:47.638 align:start position:0%
glue traps do to animals they tell us
 
04:40:50.270 --> 04:40:50.280 align:start position:0%
that they will never use these traps
 
04:40:53.230 --> 04:40:53.240 align:start position:0%
again no animal regardless of their
 
04:40:56.030 --> 04:40:56.040 align:start position:0%
species should ever be forced to endure
 
04:40:58.390 --> 04:40:58.400 align:start position:0%
the kind of suffering that glue traps
 
04:41:01.990 --> 04:41:02.000 align:start position:0%
inflict HB 1351 which is a bipartisan
 
04:41:04.310 --> 04:41:04.320 align:start position:0%
bill will measurably reduce animal
 
04:41:06.390 --> 04:41:06.400 align:start position:0%
suffering and will help spare the lives
 
04:41:09.070 --> 04:41:09.080 align:start position:0%
of countless gentle animals we urge you
 
04:41:11.310 --> 04:41:11.320 align:start position:0%
to support this Bill thank you so much

04:41:15.750 --> 04:41:15.760 align:start position:0%

i' would like to start out by saying
 
04:41:44.070 --> 04:41:44.080 align:start position:0%
mice rats other rodents are pests they
 
04:41:47.510 --> 04:41:47.520 align:start position:0%
constantly destroying property eating
 
04:41:52.830 --> 04:41:52.840 align:start position:0%
the crops in my garden ruining my walls
 
04:41:55.550 --> 04:41:55.560 align:start position:0%
so I have absolutely no quals with
 
04:41:58.110 --> 04:41:58.120 align:start position:0%
trapping or killing said
 
04:42:01.190 --> 04:42:01.200 align:start position:0%
creatures if a rodent or a pest is
 
04:42:04.190 --> 04:42:04.200 align:start position:0%
trespassing on my property destroy my
 
04:42:04.200 --> 04:42:05.150 align:start position:0%
trespassing on my property destroy my
belonging

04:42:05.150 --> 04:42:05.160 align:start position:0%
belonging
 
04:42:08.670 --> 04:42:08.680 align:start position:0%
my garden which provides a vast amount
 
04:42:09.868 --> 04:42:09.878 align:start position:0%
of what I
 
04:42:14.110 --> 04:42:14.120 align:start position:0%
eat why should
 
04:42:17.070 --> 04:42:17.080 align:start position:0%
I why should it be allowed to get away
 
04:42:19.830 --> 04:42:19.840 align:start position:0%
with such an offense why should I not be
 
04:42:23.190 --> 04:42:23.200 align:start position:0%
allowed to take measures to protect my
 
04:42:27.910 --> 04:42:27.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:31.628 --> 04:42:31.638 align:start position:0%
it I oppose this bill not just because
 
04:42:33.910 --> 04:42:33.920 align:start position:0%
of that reason but also because I don't
 
04:42:36.230 --> 04:42:36.240 align:start position:0%
believe the government has any right to
 
04:42:39.390 --> 04:42:39.400 align:start position:0%
regulate what kind of mouse traps we do
 
04:42:42.150 --> 04:42:42.160 align:start position:0%
or do not sell thank you thank
 
04:42:44.750 --> 04:42:44.760 align:start position:0%

respectfully request that the committee
 
04:43:41.270 --> 04:43:41.280 align:start position:0%
support House Bill 1351 to prohibit the
 
04:43:43.788 --> 04:43:43.798 align:start position:0%
sale and use of adhesive back traps as
 
04:43:45.910 --> 04:43:45.920 align:start position:0%
we've heard and we'll hear
 
04:43:49.510 --> 04:43:49.520 align:start position:0%
more uh these traps are one of the
 
04:43:53.350 --> 04:43:53.360 align:start position:0%
cruestv on the market and have many
 
04:43:55.628 --> 04:43:55.638 align:start position:0%
other problems associated with them so
 
04:43:58.708 --> 04:43:58.718 align:start position:0%
in 2022 our group enhan animal rights we
 
04:44:00.788 --> 04:44:00.798 align:start position:0%
made the cruelty of Goo traps one of the
 
04:44:03.868 --> 04:44:03.878 align:start position:0%
topics at our exhibit at the annual New
 
04:44:06.190 --> 04:44:06.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Fish game discover wild New
 
04:44:08.430 --> 04:44:08.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire day during this event we
 
04:44:10.110 --> 04:44:10.120 align:start position:0%
talked to hundreds of people about how
 
04:44:12.430 --> 04:44:12.440 align:start position:0%
they deal with mice we were pleasantly
 
04:44:13.830 --> 04:44:13.840 align:start position:0%
surprised that the majority of the
 
04:44:16.670 --> 04:44:16.680 align:start position:0%
people said they do not use glue
 
04:44:16.680 --> 04:44:18.230 align:start position:0%
people said they do not use glue
traps

04:44:18.230 --> 04:44:18.240 align:start position:0%
traps
 
04:44:20.590 --> 04:44:20.600 align:start position:0%
um it seems there's a widespread
 
04:44:21.948 --> 04:44:21.958 align:start position:0%
acknowledgement that these traps are
 
04:44:25.070 --> 04:44:25.080 align:start position:0%
cruel children especially recognize the
 
04:44:27.190 --> 04:44:27.200 align:start position:0%
cruelty of glue traps we invited
 
04:44:29.350 --> 04:44:29.360 align:start position:0%
children to send postcards to Walmart
 
04:44:31.628 --> 04:44:31.638 align:start position:0%
which is one of the holdout stores that
 
04:44:34.150 --> 04:44:34.160 align:start position:0%
still sells and uses these traps many
 
04:44:36.590 --> 04:44:36.600 align:start position:0%
other as Target and I might be wrong
 
04:44:40.350 --> 04:44:40.360 align:start position:0%
about Target Walgreens CVS have um sworn
 
04:44:43.270 --> 04:44:43.280 align:start position:0%
them off and on the backside of the
 
04:44:45.190 --> 04:44:45.200 align:start position:0%
sheet are four of our favorite Postcards
 
04:44:47.868 --> 04:44:47.878 align:start position:0%
From the children uh given that these
 
04:44:49.948 --> 04:44:49.958 align:start position:0%
traps are widely recognized as cruel as
 
04:44:52.110 --> 04:44:52.120 align:start position:0%
well as a threat to non-target animals
 
04:44:55.070 --> 04:44:55.080 align:start position:0%
we hope the committee will support 1351
 
04:44:56.788 --> 04:44:56.798 align:start position:0%
thank you thank
 
04:45:00.230 --> 04:45:00.240 align:start position:0%
you so I do have a question for you as
 
04:45:02.830 --> 04:45:02.840 align:start position:0%
you've cited a number of uh retailers
 
04:45:05.948 --> 04:45:05.958 align:start position:0%
who have decided upon themselves not to
 
04:45:07.150 --> 04:45:07.160 align:start position:0%
sell these
 
04:45:11.310 --> 04:45:11.320 align:start position:0%
traps and through education and Outreach
 
04:45:14.750 --> 04:45:14.760 align:start position:0%
you're educating people um reasons why
 
04:45:18.788 --> 04:45:18.798 align:start position:0%
they shouldn't use these traps and you
 
04:45:22.670 --> 04:45:22.680 align:start position:0%
are hearing from a good number of the
 
04:45:26.110 --> 04:45:26.120 align:start position:0%
public uh that they wouldn't use these
 
04:45:29.470 --> 04:45:29.480 align:start position:0%
traps um it would seem to me that um
 
04:45:33.270 --> 04:45:33.280 align:start position:0%
through public education
 
04:45:33.280 --> 04:45:34.910 align:start position:0%
through public education
that

04:45:34.910 --> 04:45:34.920 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:45:38.390 --> 04:45:38.400 align:start position:0%
probably they're not you know the they
 
04:45:40.628 --> 04:45:40.638 align:start position:0%
stores are not really selling many of
 
04:45:45.270 --> 04:45:45.280 align:start position:0%
these um why then would we put into
 
04:45:47.430 --> 04:45:47.440 align:start position:0%
statute that they would be prohibited
 
04:45:50.070 --> 04:45:50.080 align:start position:0%
from being sold if the majority of
 
04:45:52.310 --> 04:45:52.320 align:start position:0%
people are not using them thank you for
 
04:45:55.270 --> 04:45:55.280 align:start position:0%
your question so our our organization
 
04:45:58.030 --> 04:45:58.040 align:start position:0%
you know our goal is to reduce the
 
04:46:01.590 --> 04:46:01.600 align:start position:0%
amount of suffering that animals endure
 
04:46:03.470 --> 04:46:03.480 align:start position:0%
and as we heard animals are suffering
 
04:46:05.910 --> 04:46:05.920 align:start position:0%
today in these apps if we take that
 
04:46:07.310 --> 04:46:07.320 align:start position:0%
approach and just wait for all the
 
04:46:09.708 --> 04:46:09.718 align:start position:0%
stores to come on board think of all the
 
04:46:10.910 --> 04:46:10.920 align:start position:0%
the death and suffering that's going to
 
04:46:12.830 --> 04:46:12.840 align:start position:0%
be happening in the meantime we owe it
 
04:46:14.670 --> 04:46:14.680 align:start position:0%
to the animals to take action if it were
 
04:46:16.310 --> 04:46:16.320 align:start position:0%
children or puppies or kittens we
 
04:46:18.350 --> 04:46:18.360 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be suggesting that we just let
 
04:46:21.070 --> 04:46:21.080 align:start position:0%
you know things take their
 
04:46:24.628 --> 04:46:24.638 align:start position:0%
course okay any other questions from the
 
04:46:27.070 --> 04:46:27.080 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none thank you for your
 
04:46:32.628 --> 04:46:32.638 align:start position:0%
testimony today and I call um Kurt
 
04:46:35.590 --> 04:46:35.600 align:start position:0%
urg from the human
 
04:46:38.070 --> 04:46:38.080 align:start position:0%
Society good afternoon Mr
 
04:46:40.910 --> 04:46:40.920 align:start position:0%
aronberg good afternoon chairman Aaron
 
04:46:42.350 --> 04:46:42.360 align:start position:0%
and members of the committee I'm Kurt
 
04:46:44.270 --> 04:46:44.280 align:start position:0%
arenburg state director of the Humane
 
04:46:47.708 --> 04:46:47.718 align:start position:0%
Society of the United States and uh for
 
04:46:51.310 --> 04:46:51.320 align:start position:0%
all the reasons you've heard already um
 
04:46:53.708 --> 04:46:53.718 align:start position:0%
we do support this legislation these
 
04:46:57.030 --> 04:46:57.040 align:start position:0%
traps are unnecessary and
 
04:47:00.948 --> 04:47:00.958 align:start position:0%
cruel um and I would just say that there
 
04:47:04.150 --> 04:47:04.160 align:start position:0%
is federal legislation uh it's probably
 
04:47:05.470 --> 04:47:05.480 align:start position:0%
doesn't have much of a chance just
 
04:47:08.190 --> 04:47:08.200 align:start position:0%
because of the nature of the federal
 
04:47:11.110 --> 04:47:11.120 align:start position:0%
Congress these days getting things done
 
04:47:14.510 --> 04:47:14.520 align:start position:0%
um so it as many issues in the country
 
04:47:18.310 --> 04:47:18.320 align:start position:0%
now comes to you as elected legislators
 
04:47:20.390 --> 04:47:20.400 align:start position:0%
that actually are in a body that can get
 
04:47:23.390 --> 04:47:23.400 align:start position:0%
something done on the old adage of build
 
04:47:25.110 --> 04:47:25.120 align:start position:0%
a better mouse trap in the world would
 
04:47:27.990 --> 04:47:28.000 align:start position:0%
beat a path to your door you
 
04:47:31.548 --> 04:47:31.558 align:start position:0%
know pass the first Humane mous trp law
 
04:47:33.470 --> 04:47:33.480 align:start position:0%
and other states will beat a path to
 
04:47:37.350 --> 04:47:37.360 align:start position:0%
that law and so let's do this thank you
 
04:47:39.390 --> 04:47:39.400 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions from Mr
 
04:47:43.670 --> 04:47:43.680 align:start position:0%
aronberg seeing none I call um
 
04:47:45.788 --> 04:47:45.798 align:start position:0%
commissioner John Sean Jasper from the
 
04:47:48.788 --> 04:47:48.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:55.390 --> 04:47:55.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:57.628 --> 04:47:57.638 align:start position:0%
afternoon good afternoon Madam chairman
 
04:48:00.910 --> 04:48:00.920 align:start position:0%
members of the committee uh I do rise in
 
04:48:03.788 --> 04:48:03.798 align:start position:0%
opposition to the to the bill you'll
 
04:48:06.270 --> 04:48:06.280 align:start position:0%
know qu that the section of law that is
 
04:48:08.670 --> 04:48:08.680 align:start position:0%
proposed to be Amendment here actually
 
04:48:10.510 --> 04:48:10.520 align:start position:0%
does come under the jurisdiction of the
 
04:48:12.430 --> 04:48:12.440 align:start position:0%
Department of
 
04:48:15.350 --> 04:48:15.360 align:start position:0%
Agriculture and we've heard a lot of
 
04:48:18.430 --> 04:48:18.440 align:start position:0%
testimony that really tugs at your
 
04:48:21.910 --> 04:48:21.920 align:start position:0%
heartstrings and youve heard about
 
04:48:24.708 --> 04:48:24.718 align:start position:0%
Wildlife this is about rodents I would
 
04:48:27.830 --> 04:48:27.840 align:start position:0%
agree people should not be putting glue
 
04:48:32.990 --> 04:48:33.000 align:start position:0%
strips out into the area where birds and
 
04:48:33.000 --> 04:48:34.628 align:start position:0%
strips out into the area where birds and
wildlife

04:48:34.628 --> 04:48:34.638 align:start position:0%
wildlife
 
04:48:38.510 --> 04:48:38.520 align:start position:0%
are apt to be caught up in them so
 
04:48:40.788 --> 04:48:40.798 align:start position:0%
perhaps a simple amendment to make sure
 
04:48:44.350 --> 04:48:44.360 align:start position:0%
that it shall be illegal to Pro to put
 
04:48:46.750 --> 04:48:46.760 align:start position:0%
glue strips in areas that are easily
 
04:48:51.590 --> 04:48:51.600 align:start position:0%
accessible to Wildlife and birds unless
 
04:48:56.670 --> 04:48:56.680 align:start position:0%
um they are um done in a in a way that
 
04:48:59.788 --> 04:48:59.798 align:start position:0%
prevents easy exposure to that such as a
 
04:49:03.030 --> 04:49:03.040 align:start position:0%
a box with a hole in it that allows only
 
04:49:06.470 --> 04:49:06.480 align:start position:0%
rats or mice to go into it and these are
 
04:49:09.910 --> 04:49:09.920 align:start position:0%
rodents they're defined as pests in New
 
04:49:12.990 --> 04:49:13.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire statute for a reason they
 
04:49:15.590 --> 04:49:15.600 align:start position:0%
spread disease they cause damage they
 
04:49:17.590 --> 04:49:17.600 align:start position:0%
can burn down people's houses when they
 
04:49:22.230 --> 04:49:22.240 align:start position:0%
get into the into your house and chew on
 
04:49:25.590 --> 04:49:25.600 align:start position:0%
wires killing animals is not an easy
 
04:49:28.670 --> 04:49:28.680 align:start position:0%
thing to do killing rodents is not an
 
04:49:31.948 --> 04:49:31.958 align:start position:0%
easy thing to do sometimes it is
 
04:49:34.830 --> 04:49:34.840 align:start position:0%
necessary you know I I going to admit
 
04:49:36.030 --> 04:49:36.040 align:start position:0%
this to you and everybody's going to
 
04:49:38.430 --> 04:49:38.440 align:start position:0%
think I'm probably a horrible person but
 
04:49:41.150 --> 04:49:41.160 align:start position:0%
I think you need to look at the
 
04:49:45.470 --> 04:49:45.480 align:start position:0%
reality I often catch rodents and a have
 
04:49:46.590 --> 04:49:46.600 align:start position:0%
a heart
 
04:49:50.390 --> 04:49:50.400 align:start position:0%
trap I caught three my mother's 91 and I
 
04:49:52.190 --> 04:49:52.200 align:start position:0%
caught three in her house they were
 
04:49:55.150 --> 04:49:55.160 align:start position:0%
running around her house and this is
 
04:49:58.150 --> 04:49:58.160 align:start position:0%
this year what am I going to do with
 
04:50:00.310 --> 04:50:00.320 align:start position:0%
them this time of the year you're going
 
04:50:03.230 --> 04:50:03.240 align:start position:0%
to take an something out and turn it
 
04:50:06.548 --> 04:50:06.558 align:start position:0%
loose to miles away no unfortunately I
 
04:50:10.390 --> 04:50:10.400 align:start position:0%
had to drown them I hate doing that but
 
04:50:13.750 --> 04:50:13.760 align:start position:0%
what else am I going to do there and if
 
04:50:15.990 --> 04:50:16.000 align:start position:0%
you don't check those traps just like if
 
04:50:19.070 --> 04:50:19.080 align:start position:0%
you don't check a glue strip often
 
04:50:22.150 --> 04:50:22.160 align:start position:0%
enough they're going to starve to death
 
04:50:25.990 --> 04:50:26.000 align:start position:0%
in a have a heart trap it's but they're
 
04:50:27.868 --> 04:50:27.878 align:start position:0%
they're things that are doing damage
 
04:50:29.990 --> 04:50:30.000 align:start position:0%
they're certainly causing damage to
 
04:50:32.670 --> 04:50:32.680 align:start position:0%
Farmers around the state glue strips are
 
04:50:35.868 --> 04:50:35.878 align:start position:0%
in our program as part of the integrated
 
04:50:39.310 --> 04:50:39.320 align:start position:0%
Pest Management um program I will tell
 
04:50:40.750 --> 04:50:40.760 align:start position:0%
you that people say oh there are other
 
04:50:44.030 --> 04:50:44.040 align:start position:0%
ways to do it and I I tell you
 
04:50:46.788 --> 04:50:46.798 align:start position:0%
unfortunately because people thought it
 
04:50:51.548 --> 04:50:51.558 align:start position:0%
was terrible to um make these rodents
 
04:50:54.948 --> 04:50:54.958 align:start position:0%
leave a house to seek water a well-known
 
04:50:57.350 --> 04:50:57.360 align:start position:0%
company took that formula
 
04:51:01.830 --> 04:51:01.840 align:start position:0%
out um I can't use that anymore there is
 
04:51:04.110 --> 04:51:04.120 align:start position:0%
nothing worse than a dead animal rotting
 
04:51:07.230 --> 04:51:07.240 align:start position:0%
in your wall and still have that happen
 
04:51:09.390 --> 04:51:09.400 align:start position:0%
it's awful it's not
 
04:51:14.670 --> 04:51:14.680 align:start position:0%
healthy so I've you know used
 
04:51:20.230 --> 04:51:20.240 align:start position:0%
um Regular traps spring traps that's
 
04:51:22.510 --> 04:51:22.520 align:start position:0%
terrible as well it doesn't always
 
04:51:24.990 --> 04:51:25.000 align:start position:0%
instantly kill the animal either I got a
 
04:51:27.350 --> 04:51:27.360 align:start position:0%
squirrel in my attic one time got his
 
04:51:28.470 --> 04:51:28.480 align:start position:0%
tail in
 
04:51:31.190 --> 04:51:31.200 align:start position:0%
it and it's flopping around in the Attic
 
04:51:33.750 --> 04:51:33.760 align:start position:0%
which was not a a walk out attic it's a
 
04:51:35.708 --> 04:51:35.718 align:start position:0%
you know just under the
 
04:51:39.030 --> 04:51:39.040 align:start position:0%
eaves dealing with that was not not
 
04:51:42.190 --> 04:51:42.200 align:start position:0%
pleasant either but we have to allow our
 
04:51:45.750 --> 04:51:45.760 align:start position:0%
farmers and homeowners to be able to
 
04:51:47.830 --> 04:51:47.840 align:start position:0%
effectively manage it even with the
 
04:51:51.430 --> 04:51:51.440 align:start position:0%
havahart traps or the spring
 
04:51:54.110 --> 04:51:54.120 align:start position:0%
traps I have a failure rate of probably
 
04:51:56.190 --> 04:51:56.200 align:start position:0%
greater than
 
04:51:59.190 --> 04:51:59.200 align:start position:0%
50% they get the bait off the Trap
 
04:52:01.310 --> 04:52:01.320 align:start position:0%
they're able to get in and out and we
 
04:52:04.470 --> 04:52:04.480 align:start position:0%
still have these pests these r running
 
04:52:07.948 --> 04:52:07.958 align:start position:0%
around in our houses we have them in
 
04:52:10.708 --> 04:52:10.718 align:start position:0%
Barns on farms where they're eating
 
04:52:12.548 --> 04:52:12.558 align:start position:0%
through grain bags and the grain
 
04:52:15.190 --> 04:52:15.200 align:start position:0%
supplies you have to give us the
 
04:52:17.628 --> 04:52:17.638 align:start position:0%
option but you're what you were hearing
 
04:52:20.868 --> 04:52:20.878 align:start position:0%
about was Wildlife I absolutely agree
 
04:52:22.590 --> 04:52:22.600 align:start position:0%
there is no way these glue strips should
 
04:52:25.470 --> 04:52:25.480 align:start position:0%
be put where their wildlife and birds
 
04:52:27.788 --> 04:52:27.798 align:start position:0%
can get to them that is irresponsible
 
04:52:30.310 --> 04:52:30.320 align:start position:0%
I'm sure that's against most of the
 
04:52:33.788 --> 04:52:33.798 align:start position:0%
recommended um uses of them and maybe we
 
04:52:36.628 --> 04:52:36.638 align:start position:0%
could tighten that up we heard about you
 
04:52:39.948 --> 04:52:39.958 align:start position:0%
know fishing games talking about not
 
04:52:42.470 --> 04:52:42.480 align:start position:0%
using them I think there were probably
 
04:52:44.390 --> 04:52:44.400 align:start position:0%
and I didn't have time to go but I would
 
04:52:46.030 --> 04:52:46.040 align:start position:0%
encourage you to look or talk to
 
04:52:48.270 --> 04:52:48.280 align:start position:0%
somebody from fishing game I think again
 
04:52:50.070 --> 04:52:50.080 align:start position:0%
they were talking about using those
 
04:52:52.590 --> 04:52:52.600 align:start position:0%
outside I don't think fishing game has
 
04:52:55.868 --> 04:52:55.878 align:start position:0%
made a recommendation on the use of
 
04:52:55.878 --> 04:52:56.830 align:start position:0%
made a recommendation on the use of
these

04:52:56.830 --> 04:52:56.840 align:start position:0%
these
 
04:52:59.270 --> 04:52:59.280 align:start position:0%
inside none of this is fun none of this
 
04:53:02.190 --> 04:53:02.200 align:start position:0%
is easy there's no easy way to get rid
 
04:53:04.310 --> 04:53:04.320 align:start position:0%
of rodents
 
04:53:06.628 --> 04:53:06.638 align:start position:0%
um but we need to be able to protect
 
04:53:09.948 --> 04:53:09.958 align:start position:0%
public health and get rid of
 
04:53:13.750 --> 04:53:13.760 align:start position:0%
rodents thank you thank you um
 
04:53:17.510 --> 04:53:17.520 align:start position:0%
so I imagine that um people
 
04:53:19.868 --> 04:53:19.878 align:start position:0%
use various
 
04:53:22.670 --> 04:53:22.680 align:start position:0%
non-chemical intervention in uh
 
04:53:26.270 --> 04:53:26.280 align:start position:0%
capturing capturing or eliminating um
 
04:53:29.230 --> 04:53:29.240 align:start position:0%
rodents pests that kind of thing and
 
04:53:33.670 --> 04:53:33.680 align:start position:0%
especially I would imagine that um these
 
04:53:37.548 --> 04:53:37.558 align:start position:0%
kinds of glue traps are used in Orchards
 
04:53:40.910 --> 04:53:40.920 align:start position:0%
where there's food so the farmers don't
 
04:53:44.430 --> 04:53:44.440 align:start position:0%
want to use chemicals there or in food
 
04:53:48.990 --> 04:53:49.000 align:start position:0%
preparation areas um so if we were
 
04:53:49.000 --> 04:53:50.750 align:start position:0%
preparation areas um so if we were
to

04:53:50.750 --> 04:53:50.760 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:53:55.270 --> 04:53:55.280 align:start position:0%
um say prohibit the use of these traps
 
04:53:58.470 --> 04:53:58.480 align:start position:0%
in areas where there's other L wildli
 
04:54:02.110 --> 04:54:02.120 align:start position:0%
such like uh such as like in Orchards
 
04:54:04.110 --> 04:54:04.120 align:start position:0%
How would how would
 
04:54:08.310 --> 04:54:08.320 align:start position:0%
then uh these glue traps be used uh so
 
04:54:13.510 --> 04:54:13.520 align:start position:0%
as not to entrap or Target uh unintended
 
04:54:16.788 --> 04:54:16.798 align:start position:0%
species thank you um I will tell you
 
04:54:20.230 --> 04:54:20.240 align:start position:0%
that years years ago when we were in the
 
04:54:22.948 --> 04:54:22.958 align:start position:0%
poultry business one of the things that
 
04:54:25.350 --> 04:54:25.360 align:start position:0%
my father did to deal with rodents in
 
04:54:27.270 --> 04:54:27.280 align:start position:0%
the hen houses long before there were
 
04:54:32.470 --> 04:54:32.480 align:start position:0%
glue strips was he built plywood boxes
 
04:54:34.270 --> 04:54:34.280 align:start position:0%
put tar paper over over the top of them
 
04:54:35.990 --> 04:54:36.000 align:start position:0%
they were indoors but there were other
 
04:54:38.430 --> 04:54:38.440 align:start position:0%
reasons for the tar paper and cut very
 
04:54:41.390 --> 04:54:41.400 align:start position:0%
small holes in the ends so that only
 
04:54:45.230 --> 04:54:45.240 align:start position:0%
rats and mice could get in um nothing a
 
04:54:47.310 --> 04:54:47.320 align:start position:0%
chicken couldn't get in you could do the
 
04:54:49.150 --> 04:54:49.160 align:start position:0%
exact same thing where if you're
 
04:54:51.948 --> 04:54:51.958 align:start position:0%
concerned about a larger animal that
 
04:54:53.990 --> 04:54:54.000 align:start position:0%
they could not get in and just if you're
 
04:54:58.470 --> 04:54:58.480 align:start position:0%
looking to eliminate rats mice moles
 
04:55:01.230 --> 04:55:01.240 align:start position:0%
things of that nature um they could be
 
04:55:03.510 --> 04:55:03.520 align:start position:0%
that's why I said um something to the
 
04:55:05.510 --> 04:55:05.520 align:start position:0%
effect that uh they couldn't be used
 
04:55:10.628 --> 04:55:10.638 align:start position:0%
outside except where uh Wildlife is um
 
04:55:14.830 --> 04:55:14.840 align:start position:0%
prevented from being able to uh enter
 
04:55:16.670 --> 04:55:16.680 align:start position:0%
the area where they're in use and that
 
04:55:18.948 --> 04:55:18.958 align:start position:0%
would be through a that type of box I'm
 
04:55:20.750 --> 04:55:20.760 align:start position:0%
sure there are I know now that some of
 
04:55:23.270 --> 04:55:23.280 align:start position:0%
the glue strips already come in in
 
04:55:25.270 --> 04:55:25.280 align:start position:0%
certain containers where nothing else
 
04:55:28.470 --> 04:55:28.480 align:start position:0%
can get into them uh I do use have to
 
04:55:31.390 --> 04:55:31.400 align:start position:0%
use them in a self storage facility um
 
04:55:34.270 --> 04:55:34.280 align:start position:0%
because the mice get in cont constantly
 
04:55:36.510 --> 04:55:36.520 align:start position:0%
if they use poison they're going to die
 
04:55:40.788 --> 04:55:40.798 align:start position:0%
in somebody's unit um having the traps
 
04:55:42.990 --> 04:55:43.000 align:start position:0%
out there even if I put the boxes over
 
04:55:45.750 --> 04:55:45.760 align:start position:0%
them the problem is they are not
 
04:55:48.350 --> 04:55:48.360 align:start position:0%
terribly effective and in the meantime
 
04:55:51.430 --> 04:55:51.440 align:start position:0%
they're chewing into somebody else's
 
04:55:54.350 --> 04:55:54.360 align:start position:0%
property and so it's the most effective
 
04:55:56.788 --> 04:55:56.798 align:start position:0%
way to rid the buildings of them
 
04:55:59.270 --> 04:55:59.280 align:start position:0%
unfortunately I don't like it I wish I
 
04:56:02.750 --> 04:56:02.760 align:start position:0%
didn't have to do it but they have to be
 
04:56:04.990 --> 04:56:05.000 align:start position:0%
eliminated from places they don't belong
 
04:56:06.990 --> 04:56:07.000 align:start position:0%
representative ktoy you had a question I
 
04:56:09.030 --> 04:56:09.040 align:start position:0%
did thank you madam chair and thank you
 
04:56:10.990 --> 04:56:11.000 align:start position:0%
commissioner for being
 
04:56:11.000 --> 04:56:12.510 align:start position:0%
commissioner for being
here

04:56:12.510 --> 04:56:12.520 align:start position:0%
here
 
04:56:16.670 --> 04:56:16.680 align:start position:0%
so we have heard um bills in this
 
04:56:19.430 --> 04:56:19.440 align:start position:0%
committee before about
 
04:56:21.910 --> 04:56:21.920 align:start position:0%
rodents and the rodent population has
 
04:56:24.990 --> 04:56:25.000 align:start position:0%
been on the rise in New Hampshire and
 
04:56:27.910 --> 04:56:27.920 align:start position:0%
especially on farms um we're now seeing
 
04:56:31.868 --> 04:56:31.878 align:start position:0%
large rats uh where we haven't seen them
 
04:56:34.948 --> 04:56:34.958 align:start position:0%
before and
 
04:56:38.990 --> 04:56:39.000 align:start position:0%
um I agree that the glue trap should be
 
04:56:42.110 --> 04:56:42.120 align:start position:0%
used inside or in a contained space
 
04:56:44.868 --> 04:56:44.878 align:start position:0%
because obviously but the other thing
 
04:56:46.390 --> 04:56:46.400 align:start position:0%
that we're not talking about is yes they
 
04:56:48.110 --> 04:56:48.120 align:start position:0%
are a public health policy but they're
 
04:56:49.948 --> 04:56:49.958 align:start position:0%
they leave their feces
 
04:56:53.990 --> 04:56:54.000 align:start position:0%
everywhere and that is a huge issue and
 
04:56:56.548 --> 04:56:56.558 align:start position:0%
very debilitating to People's Health in
 
04:56:59.548 --> 04:56:59.558 align:start position:0%
this state um would you say that by
 
04:57:02.150 --> 04:57:02.160 align:start position:0%
eliminating the use of these traps uh we
 
04:57:04.868 --> 04:57:04.878 align:start position:0%
would see um more health issues that we
 
04:57:07.390 --> 04:57:07.400 align:start position:0%
could see more health issues certainly
 
04:57:09.590 --> 04:57:09.600 align:start position:0%
has the potential unfortunately because
 
04:57:12.910 --> 04:57:12.920 align:start position:0%
I live in a old farmhouse with rubble
 
04:57:16.750 --> 04:57:16.760 align:start position:0%
Foundation I've had to now hire um a
 
04:57:19.150 --> 04:57:19.160 align:start position:0%
company to come in on a regular basis
 
04:57:21.350 --> 04:57:21.360 align:start position:0%
because I just gave up whatever method I
 
04:57:24.670 --> 04:57:24.680 align:start position:0%
was using and they use a multiple they
 
04:57:28.150 --> 04:57:28.160 align:start position:0%
use multiple methods because my wife was
 
04:57:30.230 --> 04:57:30.240 align:start position:0%
really Disturbed opening up a drawer of
 
04:57:32.910 --> 04:57:32.920 align:start position:0%
utensils finding mice droppings in the
 
04:57:35.788 --> 04:57:35.798 align:start position:0%
in the the draws um certainly not a
 
04:57:38.270 --> 04:57:38.280 align:start position:0%
healthy situation
 
04:57:41.350 --> 04:57:41.360 align:start position:0%
and whether those animals suffer those
 
04:57:44.230 --> 04:57:44.240 align:start position:0%
rodents suffer during the process of
 
04:57:46.830 --> 04:57:46.840 align:start position:0%
dying I feel bad about that but not as
 
04:57:49.948 --> 04:57:49.958 align:start position:0%
bad as I feel about M mice droppings in
 
04:57:51.750 --> 04:57:51.760 align:start position:0%
my kitchen
 
04:57:53.910 --> 04:57:53.920 align:start position:0%
draws represent
 
04:57:55.990 --> 04:57:56.000 align:start position:0%
ger thank you madam chair and thank you
 
04:57:58.030 --> 04:57:58.040 align:start position:0%
commissioner for taking my question when
 
04:58:01.270 --> 04:58:01.280 align:start position:0%
we looked at rodenticide issues last
 
04:58:03.670 --> 04:58:03.680 align:start position:0%
time probably remember that well one of
 
04:58:05.830 --> 04:58:05.840 align:start position:0%
the discussions we had especially with
 
04:58:07.430 --> 04:58:07.440 align:start position:0%
some of the pest control folks who came
 
04:58:10.270 --> 04:58:10.280 align:start position:0%
to talk to us was that that is a really
 
04:58:12.948 --> 04:58:12.958 align:start position:0%
important tool right particular in a
 
04:58:14.750 --> 04:58:14.760 align:start position:0%
number of scenarios right we're talking
 
04:58:17.910 --> 04:58:17.920 align:start position:0%
about under structures Etc so I think
 
04:58:19.230 --> 04:58:19.240 align:start position:0%
there was broad agreement that that was
 
04:58:22.510 --> 04:58:22.520 align:start position:0%
an extremely important tool uh what I'm
 
04:58:24.310 --> 04:58:24.320 align:start position:0%
trying to get at is kind of how
 
04:58:26.590 --> 04:58:26.600 align:start position:0%
important this particular tool is and
 
04:58:29.628 --> 04:58:29.638 align:start position:0%
the larger regime of of rodent control
 
04:58:31.628 --> 04:58:31.638 align:start position:0%
if this bill were to pass is this going
 
04:58:35.270 --> 04:58:35.280 align:start position:0%
to to make make it inordinately more
 
04:58:37.708 --> 04:58:37.718 align:start position:0%
difficult uh for us to control rad and
 
04:58:41.110 --> 04:58:41.120 align:start position:0%
populations I mean exactly how large of
 
04:58:43.230 --> 04:58:43.240 align:start position:0%
an impact are we talking about are there
 
04:58:46.150 --> 04:58:46.160 align:start position:0%
enough other Alternatives that uh
 
04:58:49.548 --> 04:58:49.558 align:start position:0%
removing this as an option is not going
 
04:58:53.830 --> 04:58:53.840 align:start position:0%
to have an enormous impact that's a very
 
04:58:57.070 --> 04:58:57.080 align:start position:0%
um difficult thing for me to to judge I
 
04:58:58.830 --> 04:58:58.840 align:start position:0%
wish there were people here from pest
 
04:59:00.750 --> 04:59:00.760 align:start position:0%
control companies that could tell you
 
04:59:03.750 --> 04:59:03.760 align:start position:0%
how many they catch on on on glue traps
 
04:59:07.430 --> 04:59:07.440 align:start position:0%
versus not I can tell you that you know
 
04:59:08.750 --> 04:59:08.760 align:start position:0%
for me
 
04:59:12.628 --> 04:59:12.638 align:start position:0%
personally um it would have an impact
 
04:59:16.150 --> 04:59:16.160 align:start position:0%
because the other me methods are not as
 
04:59:19.430 --> 04:59:19.440 align:start position:0%
effective as I say a regular failure
 
04:59:21.830 --> 04:59:21.840 align:start position:0%
rate of being able to catch them either
 
04:59:25.310 --> 04:59:25.320 align:start position:0%
in have a heart or in uh snap
 
04:59:29.390 --> 04:59:29.400 align:start position:0%
traps and um you know it it's a tool in
 
04:59:32.670 --> 04:59:32.680 align:start position:0%
the toolbox that I think is absolutely
 
04:59:35.110 --> 04:59:35.120 align:start position:0%
important as you've heard you know
 
04:59:37.670 --> 04:59:37.680 align:start position:0%
there's there are more rats now than
 
04:59:40.390 --> 04:59:40.400 align:start position:0%
there there have been and I'll tell you
 
04:59:44.150 --> 04:59:44.160 align:start position:0%
that we have two old farmhouses that are
 
04:59:47.788 --> 04:59:47.798 align:start position:0%
Apartments we have no animals around for
 
04:59:49.230 --> 04:59:49.240 align:start position:0%
the first
 
04:59:51.910 --> 04:59:51.920 align:start position:0%
time and even when we were in the
 
04:59:53.628 --> 04:59:53.638 align:start position:0%
poultry business I don't remember rats
 
04:59:56.548 --> 04:59:56.558 align:start position:0%
running around we had rats in those
 
04:59:58.830 --> 04:59:58.840 align:start position:0%
houses that was very very expensive to
 
05:00:00.750 --> 05:00:00.760 align:start position:0%
get an exterminator and to deal I
 
05:00:03.830 --> 05:00:03.840 align:start position:0%
couldn't believe that we actually had
 
05:00:08.750 --> 05:00:08.760 align:start position:0%
rats no no reason um and so you know I
 
05:00:10.590 --> 05:00:10.600 align:start position:0%
would urge you not to take a tool out of
 
05:00:15.190 --> 05:00:15.200 align:start position:0%
the toolbx to protect but to protect the
 
05:00:17.190 --> 05:00:17.200 align:start position:0%
wildlife thank you thank you any other
 
05:00:20.310 --> 05:00:20.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:23.830 --> 05:00:23.840 align:start position:0%
Penza it seems like it was decades ago
 
05:00:27.670 --> 05:00:27.680 align:start position:0%
um we had a we had an um a pest control
 
05:00:30.708 --> 05:00:30.718 align:start position:0%
company come cuz we purchased a house in
 
05:00:34.910 --> 05:00:34.920 align:start position:0%
conquered and it had some mice
 
05:00:37.788 --> 05:00:37.798 align:start position:0%
and in the house and the basement they
 
05:00:41.030 --> 05:00:41.040 align:start position:0%
had used glue traps um but they didn't
 
05:00:44.310 --> 05:00:44.320 align:start position:0%
work and do people really use these
 
05:00:46.430 --> 05:00:46.440 align:start position:0%
outside like I just I'd never even
 
05:00:48.350 --> 05:00:48.360 align:start position:0%
really heard of that
 
05:00:51.390 --> 05:00:51.400 align:start position:0%
so until I was here today and heard the
 
05:00:53.670 --> 05:00:53.680 align:start position:0%
testimony I had no idea that anybody
 
05:00:55.708 --> 05:00:55.718 align:start position:0%
would use a glue trap outside apparently
 
05:00:58.670 --> 05:00:58.680 align:start position:0%
from the testimony of of others they do
 
05:01:01.548 --> 05:01:01.558 align:start position:0%
I certainly have never used a glue trap
 
05:01:04.750 --> 05:01:04.760 align:start position:0%
any place except inside nor would
 
05:01:07.070 --> 05:01:07.080 align:start position:0%
I follow up
 
05:01:11.868 --> 05:01:11.878 align:start position:0%
follow so is there a way to um amend
 
05:01:15.070 --> 05:01:15.080 align:start position:0%
this bill to make it so you know stating
 
05:01:18.708 --> 05:01:18.718 align:start position:0%
that it's illegal to use glue traps you
 
05:01:21.590 --> 05:01:21.600 align:start position:0%
know in a in a place where it can hurt
 
05:01:21.600 --> 05:01:22.750 align:start position:0%
know in a in a place where it can hurt
other

05:01:22.750 --> 05:01:22.760 align:start position:0%
other
 
05:01:25.310 --> 05:01:25.320 align:start position:0%
Wildlife well I certainly think you
 
05:01:28.310 --> 05:01:28.320 align:start position:0%
could and I would incourage you to do so
 
05:01:31.270 --> 05:01:31.280 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby so do you happen to
 
05:01:34.230 --> 05:01:34.240 align:start position:0%
know what section of the the code that
 
05:01:37.030 --> 05:01:37.040 align:start position:0%
of the rsa's such Amendment would have
 
05:01:40.390 --> 05:01:40.400 align:start position:0%
to happen to go into well this this bill
 
05:01:43.350 --> 05:01:43.360 align:start position:0%
amends uh 40
 
05:01:46.990 --> 05:01:47.000 align:start position:0%
43041 and creates a new section A and I
 
05:01:49.230 --> 05:01:49.240 align:start position:0%
think you could probably do that in in
 
05:01:50.830 --> 05:01:50.840 align:start position:0%
that area because that is the section of
 
05:01:53.750 --> 05:01:53.760 align:start position:0%
law dealing with rodent control pest
 
05:01:56.510 --> 05:01:56.520 align:start position:0%
actually Pest Control including rodents
 
05:01:58.590 --> 05:01:58.600 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you any other questions
 
05:02:00.430 --> 05:02:00.440 align:start position:0%
from the committee represent
 
05:02:03.070 --> 05:02:03.080 align:start position:0%
Duty thank you madam chair okay this is
 
05:02:06.948 --> 05:02:06.958 align:start position:0%
a little off base but um you know we've
 
05:02:08.948 --> 05:02:08.958 align:start position:0%
heard about this problem for a long time
 
05:02:11.110 --> 05:02:11.120 align:start position:0%
so is the integrated Pest Management
 
05:02:14.430 --> 05:02:14.440 align:start position:0%
program or anything going on at UNH to
 
05:02:17.390 --> 05:02:17.400 align:start position:0%
consider um birth control for these
 
05:02:21.110 --> 05:02:21.120 align:start position:0%
animals I mean any any exploration any
 
05:02:23.070 --> 05:02:23.080 align:start position:0%
scientific it seems to me if the
 
05:02:25.430 --> 05:02:25.440 align:start position:0%
population is growing that I mean if we
 
05:02:28.030 --> 05:02:28.040 align:start position:0%
if we put food out that had some kind of
 
05:02:29.750 --> 05:02:29.760 align:start position:0%
a formula in it so that they couldn't
 
05:02:31.868 --> 05:02:31.878 align:start position:0%
reproduce or couldn't reproduce as
 
05:02:35.150 --> 05:02:35.160 align:start position:0%
quickly that maybe that is an area of
 
05:02:37.548 --> 05:02:37.558 align:start position:0%
exploration do you know of any I am not
 
05:02:40.350 --> 05:02:40.360 align:start position:0%
aware of any research going on on p on
 
05:02:42.150 --> 05:02:42.160 align:start position:0%
this type of pest control at all any
 
05:02:43.708 --> 05:02:43.718 align:start position:0%
other questions from the
 
05:02:45.830 --> 05:02:45.840 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none thank you
 
05:02:48.230 --> 05:02:48.240 align:start position:0%
commissioner for coming to testify this
 
05:02:55.830 --> 05:02:55.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:58.750 --> 05:02:58.760 align:start position:0%
okay good
 
05:03:00.910 --> 05:03:00.920 align:start position:0%
afternoon good afternoon Madam chair
 
05:03:03.150 --> 05:03:03.160 align:start position:0%
Representatives my name is Adam I'm the
 
05:03:05.430 --> 05:03:05.440 align:start position:0%
owner of pest end uh but I'm here today
 
05:03:07.750 --> 05:03:07.760 align:start position:0%
as a representative for New England Pest
 
05:03:10.230 --> 05:03:10.240 align:start position:0%
Management we've heard a lot about how
 
05:03:12.350 --> 05:03:12.360 align:start position:0%
this impacts the rodent population and I
 
05:03:14.230 --> 05:03:14.240 align:start position:0%
do understand that this whole bill is
 
05:03:16.670 --> 05:03:16.680 align:start position:0%
based on rodents but in the bill itself
 
05:03:20.470 --> 05:03:20.480 align:start position:0%
it does say any adhesive device which
 
05:03:22.548 --> 05:03:22.558 align:start position:0%
really leads it to a very broad spectrum
 
05:03:23.948 --> 05:03:23.958 align:start position:0%
of what that
 
05:03:27.750 --> 05:03:27.760 align:start position:0%
means we have been fighting for the last
 
05:03:31.510 --> 05:03:31.520 align:start position:0%
15 years and by we I mean a nation to
 
05:03:35.788 --> 05:03:35.798 align:start position:0%
limit pesticide use we instituted IPM
 
05:03:37.670 --> 05:03:37.680 align:start position:0%
integrated Pest Management the whole
 
05:03:40.310 --> 05:03:40.320 align:start position:0%
point of IPM is to monitor figure out
 
05:03:42.350 --> 05:03:42.360 align:start position:0%
what pest you're dealing with catch it
 
05:03:45.310 --> 05:03:45.320 align:start position:0%
early make sanitation changes structural
 
05:03:47.910 --> 05:03:47.920 align:start position:0%
changes to help eliminate that problem
 
05:03:50.390 --> 05:03:50.400 align:start position:0%
without using as many
 
05:03:54.510 --> 05:03:54.520 align:start position:0%
pesticides removing adhesive traps will
 
05:03:58.150 --> 05:03:58.160 align:start position:0%
drastically impact how that works we use
 
05:03:59.910 --> 05:03:59.920 align:start position:0%
those representative Canon said it
 
05:04:02.030 --> 05:04:02.040 align:start position:0%
earlier when they were in the basement
 
05:04:04.110 --> 05:04:04.120 align:start position:0%
she cut in insects on them we use them
 
05:04:06.070 --> 05:04:06.080 align:start position:0%
as insect monitors most of the
 
05:04:07.750 --> 05:04:07.760 align:start position:0%
restaurants you walk into somewhere
 
05:04:09.070 --> 05:04:09.080 align:start position:0%
you're going to see a nice little light
 
05:04:11.030 --> 05:04:11.040 align:start position:0%
on the wall that illuminates probably a
 
05:04:13.070 --> 05:04:13.080 align:start position:0%
blue color those are fly traps they have
 
05:04:16.470 --> 05:04:16.480 align:start position:0%
glue boards inside of them that's what
 
05:04:18.830 --> 05:04:18.840 align:start position:0%
the biggest impact to us would be and
 
05:04:20.110 --> 05:04:20.120 align:start position:0%
you can say well that's not where
 
05:04:22.670 --> 05:04:22.680 align:start position:0%
rodents are going to get caught we've
 
05:04:24.590 --> 05:04:24.600 align:start position:0%
all been listening today about how some
 
05:04:26.868 --> 05:04:26.878 align:start position:0%
of these glue traps are not being used
 
05:04:29.070 --> 05:04:29.080 align:start position:0%
properly there's no reason to have glue
 
05:04:29.080 --> 05:04:29.990 align:start position:0%
properly there's no reason to have glue
boards

05:04:29.990 --> 05:04:30.000 align:start position:0%
boards
 
05:04:32.910 --> 05:04:32.920 align:start position:0%
outside they will freeze with within a
 
05:04:35.110 --> 05:04:35.120 align:start position:0%
matter of minutes maybe hours they're
 
05:04:36.470 --> 05:04:36.480 align:start position:0%
going to flip over and get dusty and
 
05:04:39.190 --> 05:04:39.200 align:start position:0%
dirty and become ineffective and useless
 
05:04:42.670 --> 05:04:42.680 align:start position:0%
so there is no one no reputable company
 
05:04:44.270 --> 05:04:44.280 align:start position:0%
that provides pest control that is
 
05:04:45.868 --> 05:04:45.878 align:start position:0%
putting these outside there's no
 
05:04:47.990 --> 05:04:48.000 align:start position:0%
reputable company that is putting them
 
05:04:50.470 --> 05:04:50.480 align:start position:0%
to be used for wildlife control that is
 
05:04:53.628 --> 05:04:53.638 align:start position:0%
not what we do we do need these for
 
05:04:55.910 --> 05:04:55.920 align:start position:0%
roading control from time to time
 
05:04:58.868 --> 05:04:58.878 align:start position:0%
there's a a place that we service that
 
05:05:02.548 --> 05:05:02.558 align:start position:0%
in 6 weeks we pulled out over 400 mice
 
05:05:04.430 --> 05:05:04.440 align:start position:0%
if we did that with snap traps or some
 
05:05:06.548 --> 05:05:06.558 align:start position:0%
other type it would have taken forever
 
05:05:08.590 --> 05:05:08.600 align:start position:0%
and we would have never gained control
 
05:05:10.430 --> 05:05:10.440 align:start position:0%
being able to put these out for a mass
 
05:05:12.990 --> 05:05:13.000 align:start position:0%
trapping as we call it is helping the
 
05:05:14.788 --> 05:05:14.798 align:start position:0%
public health it's helping our food
 
05:05:17.310 --> 05:05:17.320 align:start position:0%
sources this can't be removed from what
 
05:05:19.750 --> 05:05:19.760 align:start position:0%
we're doing so that's one side of the
 
05:05:21.430 --> 05:05:21.440 align:start position:0%
rodent part of it but again the other
 
05:05:23.548 --> 05:05:23.558 align:start position:0%
side with our insect monitors the
 
05:05:25.788 --> 05:05:25.798 align:start position:0%
restaurants you go to unfortunately from
 
05:05:27.110 --> 05:05:27.120 align:start position:0%
time to time they get
 
05:05:30.070 --> 05:05:30.080 align:start position:0%
roaches it's far easier for us to catch
 
05:05:31.510 --> 05:05:31.520 align:start position:0%
that when there's one or two in this
 
05:05:33.830 --> 05:05:33.840 align:start position:0%
corner as opposed to waiting until
 
05:05:35.548 --> 05:05:35.558 align:start position:0%
there's one or two hundred that have now
 
05:05:36.910 --> 05:05:36.920 align:start position:0%
gotten into the restaurant and we can
 
05:05:39.788 --> 05:05:39.798 align:start position:0%
finally find them so I don't see how
 
05:05:43.590 --> 05:05:43.600 align:start position:0%
there's a way to ban adhesive traps
 
05:05:46.110 --> 05:05:46.120 align:start position:0%
without negatively impacting every other
 
05:05:47.510 --> 05:05:47.520 align:start position:0%
type of pest control that we're trying
 
05:05:50.470 --> 05:05:50.480 align:start position:0%
to do you can might make adjustments or
 
05:05:52.390 --> 05:05:52.400 align:start position:0%
Law changes that say well don't use it
 
05:05:54.190 --> 05:05:54.200 align:start position:0%
outside don't use it here people who
 
05:05:56.190 --> 05:05:56.200 align:start position:0%
aren't reading the recommendations still
 
05:05:58.310 --> 05:05:58.320 align:start position:0%
aren't going to read the recommendations
 
05:06:00.350 --> 05:06:00.360 align:start position:0%
so what you're going to eventually do is
 
05:06:02.150 --> 05:06:02.160 align:start position:0%
hurt the people that need to use it the
 
05:06:05.030 --> 05:06:05.040 align:start position:0%
right way to protect our food sources
 
05:06:08.110 --> 05:06:08.120 align:start position:0%
and our public health so that's why I
 
05:06:10.430 --> 05:06:10.440 align:start position:0%
and New England Pest Management oppose
 
05:06:12.910 --> 05:06:12.920 align:start position:0%
this bill and don't think that there is
 
05:06:12.920 --> 05:06:13.750 align:start position:0%
this bill and don't think that there is
a

05:06:13.750 --> 05:06:13.760 align:start position:0%
a
 
05:06:16.628 --> 05:06:16.638 align:start position:0%
reasonable adjustment that can be made
 
05:06:18.230 --> 05:06:18.240 align:start position:0%
to make this
 
05:06:21.510 --> 05:06:21.520 align:start position:0%
work thank you representative Murray
 
05:06:22.910 --> 05:06:22.920 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you for
 
05:06:24.350 --> 05:06:24.360 align:start position:0%
the question I did have a question with
 
05:06:26.948 --> 05:06:26.958 align:start position:0%
regard to um things that are more geared
 
05:06:29.948 --> 05:06:29.958 align:start position:0%
towards like flies or spotted Lantern
 
05:06:31.990 --> 05:06:32.000 align:start position:0%
fly for example in other states and we
 
05:06:33.628 --> 05:06:33.638 align:start position:0%
know that that that's sort of a species
 
05:06:37.030 --> 05:06:37.040 align:start position:0%
that is working its way north um so I'm
 
05:06:39.430 --> 05:06:39.440 align:start position:0%
curious to know whether or not um the
 
05:06:41.750 --> 05:06:41.760 align:start position:0%
glues are different in maybe like the
 
05:06:43.390 --> 05:06:43.400 align:start position:0%
hanging papers that are designed to
 
05:06:45.190 --> 05:06:45.200 align:start position:0%
attract flies or other types of things
 
05:06:49.390 --> 05:06:49.400 align:start position:0%
versus the the the papers that are super
 
05:06:53.310 --> 05:06:53.320 align:start position:0%
super uh adhesive for like a mouse so
 
05:06:56.670 --> 05:06:56.680 align:start position:0%
the the hanging fly tape that's also
 
05:06:58.310 --> 05:06:58.320 align:start position:0%
another thing our industry doesn't use
 
05:06:59.868 --> 05:06:59.878 align:start position:0%
that's more of a general consumer we
 
05:07:01.830 --> 05:07:01.840 align:start position:0%
don't recommend them most health
 
05:07:03.750 --> 05:07:03.760 align:start position:0%
departments actually ban them from being
 
05:07:05.788 --> 05:07:05.798 align:start position:0%
used in any kitchens or anything like
 
05:07:07.788 --> 05:07:07.798 align:start position:0%
that so I'm going to kind of exclude
 
05:07:10.350 --> 05:07:10.360 align:start position:0%
that when it comes to the flyboards or
 
05:07:13.510 --> 05:07:13.520 align:start position:0%
insect monitors there's a standard that
 
05:07:15.390 --> 05:07:15.400 align:start position:0%
they're all pretty much the same you can
 
05:07:17.708 --> 05:07:17.718 align:start position:0%
buy ones that have a thicker glue if
 
05:07:19.510 --> 05:07:19.520 align:start position:0%
you're trying to catch a rat if you're
 
05:07:20.868 --> 05:07:20.878 align:start position:0%
trying to catch a rat you need a thicker
 
05:07:23.110 --> 05:07:23.120 align:start position:0%
glue as opposed to a mouse so yes there
 
05:07:27.510 --> 05:07:27.520 align:start position:0%
are varying levels of glue but 95% are
 
05:07:31.310 --> 05:07:31.320 align:start position:0%
all pretty much the same
 
05:07:34.590 --> 05:07:34.600 align:start position:0%
adhesive okay thank you and so in this
 
05:07:37.548 --> 05:07:37.558 align:start position:0%
bill um it the first in the first
 
05:07:38.670 --> 05:07:38.680 align:start position:0%
section it
 
05:07:42.750 --> 05:07:42.760 align:start position:0%
defines adhesive based traps means any
 
05:07:44.948 --> 05:07:44.958 align:start position:0%
device that is designed or is capable of
 
05:07:48.470 --> 05:07:48.480 align:start position:0%
being used to capture a rodent by means
 
05:07:50.470 --> 05:07:50.480 align:start position:0%
of an adhesive substance including
 
05:07:53.070 --> 05:07:53.080 align:start position:0%
devices commonly known as glue traps
 
05:07:55.708 --> 05:07:55.718 align:start position:0%
glue boards or any similar rodent
 
05:07:59.150 --> 05:07:59.160 align:start position:0%
trap and further down in the bill it
 
05:08:02.830 --> 05:08:02.840 align:start position:0%
does say just adhesive based traps so I
 
05:08:04.628 --> 05:08:04.638 align:start position:0%
can see where there may be some
 
05:08:07.788 --> 05:08:07.798 align:start position:0%
confusion as you know we're banning all
 
05:08:12.708 --> 05:08:12.718 align:start position:0%
adhesive based traps um but based on
 
05:08:17.430 --> 05:08:17.440 align:start position:0%
what the definition is it just points to
 
05:08:19.750 --> 05:08:19.760 align:start position:0%
rodents I
 
05:08:23.868 --> 05:08:23.878 align:start position:0%
um I just wanted to clarify that for um
 
05:08:28.590 --> 05:08:28.600 align:start position:0%
for purposes of just everybody and but
 
05:08:31.030 --> 05:08:31.040 align:start position:0%
would you agree I mean I think you did
 
05:08:34.070 --> 05:08:34.080 align:start position:0%
say that the these kinds of adhesive
 
05:08:37.190 --> 05:08:37.200 align:start position:0%
base traps should not be used Outdoors
 
05:08:39.670 --> 05:08:39.680 align:start position:0%
correct I mean although I have heard
 
05:08:42.670 --> 05:08:42.680 align:start position:0%
that people who own apple orchards Peach
 
05:08:46.030 --> 05:08:46.040 align:start position:0%
Orchards fruit bearing trees whatever
 
05:08:49.030 --> 05:08:49.040 align:start position:0%
that they you they may use these as a
 
05:08:52.470 --> 05:08:52.480 align:start position:0%
means of not uh being able not using
 
05:08:55.470 --> 05:08:55.480 align:start position:0%
chemicals chemical-based
 
05:09:00.150 --> 05:09:00.160 align:start position:0%
um um traps and
 
05:09:04.390 --> 05:09:04.400 align:start position:0%
so would you agree that then that they
 
05:09:06.628 --> 05:09:06.638 align:start position:0%
should then still be prohibited from
 
05:09:09.430 --> 05:09:09.440 align:start position:0%
using those traps and those
 
05:09:11.708 --> 05:09:11.718 align:start position:0%
venues I don't see there being a need
 
05:09:13.750 --> 05:09:13.760 align:start position:0%
for it I hate prohibiting anything
 
05:09:15.510 --> 05:09:15.520 align:start position:0%
because removing a tool from that
 
05:09:17.830 --> 05:09:17.840 align:start position:0%
toolbox is always a problem I wasn't I
 
05:09:19.628 --> 05:09:19.638 align:start position:0%
was here not too long ago where there's
 
05:09:21.110 --> 05:09:21.120 align:start position:0%
also rodenticides that are trying to be
 
05:09:22.868 --> 05:09:22.878 align:start position:0%
pulled so if you pull the rodenticides
 
05:09:24.110 --> 05:09:24.120 align:start position:0%
from them and you pull the glue boards
 
05:09:26.868 --> 05:09:26.878 align:start position:0%
from them what are they going to do um
 
05:09:30.150 --> 05:09:30.160 align:start position:0%
so it's it's tough again to me as an
 
05:09:32.750 --> 05:09:32.760 align:start position:0%
applicator I don't see the need need to
 
05:09:34.110 --> 05:09:34.120 align:start position:0%
put that out there because we have other
 
05:09:36.390 --> 05:09:36.400 align:start position:0%
options but at the same time I'm not a
 
05:09:38.788 --> 05:09:38.798 align:start position:0%
farmer I don't know what they go through
 
05:09:39.830 --> 05:09:39.840 align:start position:0%
I don't know what they're dealing with
 
05:09:42.548 --> 05:09:42.558 align:start position:0%
on a day-to-day basis so to pull that it
 
05:09:44.190 --> 05:09:44.200 align:start position:0%
could cause a bigger problem and even
 
05:09:46.190 --> 05:09:46.200 align:start position:0%
putting them in some of these locked
 
05:09:48.470 --> 05:09:48.480 align:start position:0%
traps that we have we're going to run
 
05:09:49.910 --> 05:09:49.920 align:start position:0%
into the same concerns that we already
 
05:09:51.390 --> 05:09:51.400 align:start position:0%
have because if the hole is big enough
 
05:09:53.310 --> 05:09:53.320 align:start position:0%
for a rat it's big enough for most of
 
05:09:54.470 --> 05:09:54.480 align:start position:0%
the things that the people here are
 
05:09:57.788 --> 05:09:57.798 align:start position:0%
concerned about so while I don't use
 
05:09:59.750 --> 05:09:59.760 align:start position:0%
them and I don't see a need for them and
 
05:10:01.350 --> 05:10:01.360 align:start position:0%
our industry doesn't see a need for them
 
05:10:03.830 --> 05:10:03.840 align:start position:0%
to be used outdoors I don't want to
 
05:10:05.830 --> 05:10:05.840 align:start position:0%
speak on behalf of farmers and and
 
05:10:07.230 --> 05:10:07.240 align:start position:0%
people who are trying to put food on our
 
05:10:10.548 --> 05:10:10.558 align:start position:0%
tables thank you representa
 
05:10:14.110 --> 05:10:14.120 align:start position:0%
dsy thank you madam chair so we've been
 
05:10:20.190 --> 05:10:20.200 align:start position:0%
using pesticides for 50 670 years and
 
05:10:22.708 --> 05:10:22.718 align:start position:0%
our rodent population continues to
 
05:10:26.190 --> 05:10:26.200 align:start position:0%
increase so my question to you is what
 
05:10:29.270 --> 05:10:29.280 align:start position:0%
is your industry doing to come up with
 
05:10:33.510 --> 05:10:33.520 align:start position:0%
other Humane ways to control these
 
05:10:36.430 --> 05:10:36.440 align:start position:0%
populations because it really appears
 
05:10:38.350 --> 05:10:38.360 align:start position:0%
that what we've been doing for the last
 
05:10:41.110 --> 05:10:41.120 align:start position:0%
70 years and the increase in pesticides
 
05:10:42.868 --> 05:10:42.878 align:start position:0%
is not the
 
05:10:45.270 --> 05:10:45.280 align:start position:0%
answer so yes we've been using them for
 
05:10:47.590 --> 05:10:47.600 align:start position:0%
that long but for the last 10 years
 
05:10:50.150 --> 05:10:50.160 align:start position:0%
we're slowly losing things we're slowly
 
05:10:51.750 --> 05:10:51.760 align:start position:0%
losing different types of baits and
 
05:10:54.708 --> 05:10:54.718 align:start position:0%
dusts and traps that we can use
 
05:10:57.390 --> 05:10:57.400 align:start position:0%
additionally our country is growing so
 
05:10:59.390 --> 05:10:59.400 align:start position:0%
where rodents had places to live now
 
05:11:01.390 --> 05:11:01.400 align:start position:0%
they're coming closer to us so that's a
 
05:11:03.390 --> 05:11:03.400 align:start position:0%
lot of what we're seeing we have a lot
 
05:11:05.788 --> 05:11:05.798 align:start position:0%
of Sanitation issues within our country
 
05:11:07.910 --> 05:11:07.920 align:start position:0%
whether it's restaurants supermarkets
 
05:11:09.548 --> 05:11:09.558 align:start position:0%
convenience stores they're not doing
 
05:11:11.750 --> 05:11:11.760 align:start position:0%
what they're supposed to do which is
 
05:11:14.030 --> 05:11:14.040 align:start position:0%
helping that population quickly
 
05:11:17.270 --> 05:11:17.280 align:start position:0%
reproduce what we as an industry are
 
05:11:20.708 --> 05:11:20.718 align:start position:0%
doing we are very focused on exclusion
 
05:11:23.150 --> 05:11:23.160 align:start position:0%
as an industry we want to seal your
 
05:11:25.150 --> 05:11:25.160 align:start position:0%
house up we want to make sure they can't
 
05:11:27.030 --> 05:11:27.040 align:start position:0%
get back in but we still have to get rid
 
05:11:28.230 --> 05:11:28.240 align:start position:0%
of the ones that are inside of your
 
05:11:30.750 --> 05:11:30.760 align:start position:0%
house so if they're outside and they're
 
05:11:32.948 --> 05:11:32.958 align:start position:0%
not trying to get in for the most part
 
05:11:35.030 --> 05:11:35.040 align:start position:0%
we're okay with it even when we're using
 
05:11:36.670 --> 05:11:36.680 align:start position:0%
the baits that's up against your house
 
05:11:38.310 --> 05:11:38.320 align:start position:0%
we're protecting your house I don't care
 
05:11:39.788 --> 05:11:39.798 align:start position:0%
about what's living in the woods that's
 
05:11:42.910 --> 05:11:42.920 align:start position:0%
where they're supposed to be let it work
 
05:11:44.830 --> 05:11:44.840 align:start position:0%
but our whole thing is exclusion it is
 
05:11:47.310 --> 05:11:47.320 align:start position:0%
trapping there's smart devices now where
 
05:11:48.590 --> 05:11:48.600 align:start position:0%
they're letting you know when something
 
05:11:50.628 --> 05:11:50.638 align:start position:0%
is caught so we can get there quicker uh
 
05:11:52.470 --> 05:11:52.480 align:start position:0%
there's electrocution devices there's a
 
05:11:54.310 --> 05:11:54.320 align:start position:0%
lot of different avenues that we're
 
05:11:56.150 --> 05:11:56.160 align:start position:0%
trying and I believe you're the one that
 
05:11:58.750 --> 05:11:58.760 align:start position:0%
asked about the birth control devices
 
05:12:00.830 --> 05:12:00.840 align:start position:0%
there's been one out on the market for
 
05:12:03.070 --> 05:12:03.080 align:start position:0%
probably about 10 years
 
05:12:05.990 --> 05:12:06.000 align:start position:0%
now it's not working the acceptance
 
05:12:08.470 --> 05:12:08.480 align:start position:0%
level is horrible on rodents that would
 
05:12:10.470 --> 05:12:10.480 align:start position:0%
be an easy way to do it that would be
 
05:12:11.990 --> 05:12:12.000 align:start position:0%
very simple but they haven't come up
 
05:12:14.070 --> 05:12:14.080 align:start position:0%
with that formula yet that works I can
 
05:12:15.670 --> 05:12:15.680 align:start position:0%
tell you our industry this is what we're
 
05:12:18.230 --> 05:12:18.240 align:start position:0%
talking about constantly we need to
 
05:12:19.948 --> 05:12:19.958 align:start position:0%
figure out what's the next best thing
 
05:12:21.948 --> 05:12:21.958 align:start position:0%
what can we do cuz we see what's going
 
05:12:25.150 --> 05:12:25.160 align:start position:0%
on we see how the trend is exclusion and
 
05:12:27.628 --> 05:12:27.638 align:start position:0%
trapping is the best part of what we can
 
05:12:30.310 --> 05:12:30.320 align:start position:0%
do but it doesn't work on everything we
 
05:12:32.110 --> 05:12:32.120 align:start position:0%
have videos of rats taking their tail
 
05:12:33.670 --> 05:12:33.680 align:start position:0%
and hitting snap traps to set them off
 
05:12:35.830 --> 05:12:35.840 align:start position:0%
so they can get the bait some of them
 
05:12:37.350 --> 05:12:37.360 align:start position:0%
will get caught in a snap trap some of
 
05:12:38.590 --> 05:12:38.600 align:start position:0%
them will get caught in a glue board
 
05:12:41.430 --> 05:12:41.440 align:start position:0%
some of them will eat bait they're smart
 
05:12:43.590 --> 05:12:43.600 align:start position:0%
they know what to do so every time we
 
05:12:45.628 --> 05:12:45.638 align:start position:0%
lose something the rodent population
 
05:12:48.670 --> 05:12:48.680 align:start position:0%
increases so that that's a a big concern
 
05:12:50.910 --> 05:12:50.920 align:start position:0%
for us to make sure that we have what we
 
05:12:54.548 --> 05:12:54.558 align:start position:0%
can to try and keep everything safe
 
05:12:58.990 --> 05:12:59.000 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby yeah so um what is
 
05:13:01.070 --> 05:13:01.080 align:start position:0%
the effectiveness of the glue traps
 
05:13:03.548 --> 05:13:03.558 align:start position:0%
relative to the effectiveness of snap
 
05:13:06.590 --> 05:13:06.600 align:start position:0%
traps and electrocution
 
05:13:08.670 --> 05:13:08.680 align:start position:0%
traps so I'm going to say they're all
 
05:13:10.948 --> 05:13:10.958 align:start position:0%
relatively similar um again the biggest
 
05:13:12.590 --> 05:13:12.600 align:start position:0%
thing as I was just
 
05:13:15.548 --> 05:13:15.558 align:start position:0%
saying they will generationally learn
 
05:13:18.548 --> 05:13:18.558 align:start position:0%
what to avoid so if we have an account
 
05:13:20.150 --> 05:13:20.160 align:start position:0%
that we're constantly using snap traps
 
05:13:23.150 --> 05:13:23.160 align:start position:0%
on and that's all we use there will come
 
05:13:25.430 --> 05:13:25.440 align:start position:0%
a time when we will not catch anything
 
05:13:27.430 --> 05:13:27.440 align:start position:0%
because they will teach each other stay
 
05:13:29.470 --> 05:13:29.480 align:start position:0%
away from those devices so if you're
 
05:13:30.948 --> 05:13:30.958 align:start position:0%
always using the same thing over and
 
05:13:32.470 --> 05:13:32.480 align:start position:0%
over and over again
 
05:13:33.910 --> 05:13:33.920 align:start position:0%
that's where you come into the problem
 
05:13:36.350 --> 05:13:36.360 align:start position:0%
so having multiple options out there is
 
05:13:38.510 --> 05:13:38.520 align:start position:0%
what's going to help the most now again
 
05:13:41.750 --> 05:13:41.760 align:start position:0%
as I said glueboards by themselves we
 
05:13:44.070 --> 05:13:44.080 align:start position:0%
don't typically use them all that often
 
05:13:45.670 --> 05:13:45.680 align:start position:0%
they get dirty very quickly as soon as
 
05:13:47.310 --> 05:13:47.320 align:start position:0%
they're covered in dust a mouse can walk
 
05:13:50.270 --> 05:13:50.280 align:start position:0%
right over it so you have to have them
 
05:13:51.990 --> 05:13:52.000 align:start position:0%
in traps or you have to have other
 
05:13:54.590 --> 05:13:54.600 align:start position:0%
options there but the downside to a snap
 
05:13:58.230 --> 05:13:58.240 align:start position:0%
trap you catch one and until you're back
 
05:14:00.830 --> 05:14:00.840 align:start position:0%
it's useless so when the account that I
 
05:14:02.350 --> 05:14:02.360 align:start position:0%
brought up where there was four 00 mice
 
05:14:03.190 --> 05:14:03.200 align:start position:0%
that we
 
05:14:05.708 --> 05:14:05.718 align:start position:0%
removed if we just had snap
 
05:14:08.070 --> 05:14:08.080 align:start position:0%
traps it it just it never would have
 
05:14:10.990 --> 05:14:11.000 align:start position:0%
worked and that's where we we run into
 
05:14:12.548 --> 05:14:12.558 align:start position:0%
those problems so the effectiveness is
 
05:14:14.750 --> 05:14:14.760 align:start position:0%
very similar but it's just really based
 
05:14:16.470 --> 05:14:16.480 align:start position:0%
on the
 
05:14:19.708 --> 05:14:19.718 align:start position:0%
situation represent NAB thank you madam
 
05:14:21.150 --> 05:14:21.160 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for taking my question
 
05:14:22.548 --> 05:14:22.558 align:start position:0%
um one of the things we talked about
 
05:14:23.548 --> 05:14:23.558 align:start position:0%
with the second generation
 
05:14:27.548 --> 05:14:27.558 align:start position:0%
anti-coagulants was um making it so that
 
05:14:28.990 --> 05:14:29.000 align:start position:0%
they could not be used for home use that
 
05:14:30.430 --> 05:14:30.440 align:start position:0%
they were used by licensed applicators
 
05:14:32.070 --> 05:14:32.080 align:start position:0%
do you see any mechanism for doing that
 
05:14:34.708 --> 05:14:34.718 align:start position:0%
here are these more used by individuals
 
05:14:37.788 --> 05:14:37.798 align:start position:0%
than they are by license applicators or
 
05:14:39.990 --> 05:14:40.000 align:start position:0%
press control I think they're misused
 
05:14:43.110 --> 05:14:43.120 align:start position:0%
more by consumers um but yeah I think
 
05:14:45.948 --> 05:14:45.958 align:start position:0%
for the most part if you took out how we
 
05:14:48.548 --> 05:14:48.558 align:start position:0%
use them for insect monitors and and fly
 
05:14:51.190 --> 05:14:51.200 align:start position:0%
lights and all of that yeah I think our
 
05:14:53.230 --> 05:14:53.240 align:start position:0%
our industry isn't using glue boards as
 
05:14:54.910 --> 05:14:54.920 align:start position:0%
much as the general consumer for roading
 
05:14:57.030 --> 05:14:57.040 align:start position:0%
control are they used absolutely are
 
05:14:58.708 --> 05:14:58.718 align:start position:0%
there some companies that use them more
 
05:15:01.830 --> 05:15:01.840 align:start position:0%
than others yes um but there are many
 
05:15:03.390 --> 05:15:03.400 align:start position:0%
options that as an industry we are
 
05:15:03.400 --> 05:15:04.310 align:start position:0%
options that as an industry we are
looking

05:15:04.310 --> 05:15:04.320 align:start position:0%
looking
 
05:15:09.788 --> 05:15:09.798 align:start position:0%
in or looking at to to resolve rodent
 
05:15:12.948 --> 05:15:12.958 align:start position:0%

05:17:15.310 --> 05:17:15.320 align:start position:0%
most contentiously red tailed
 
05:17:17.788 --> 05:17:17.798 align:start position:0%
kangaroos this bill began its life as a
 
05:17:19.628 --> 05:17:19.638 align:start position:0%
Twitter request for pet monkeys and
 
05:17:21.670 --> 05:17:21.680 align:start position:0%
rapidly expanded into a wish list of
 
05:17:24.708 --> 05:17:24.718 align:start position:0%
cute furry friends uh my girlfriend was
 
05:17:26.948 --> 05:17:26.958 align:start position:0%
especially accept uh especially happy to
 
05:17:28.670 --> 05:17:28.680 align:start position:0%
find out that raccoons made the list as
 
05:17:30.190 --> 05:17:30.200 align:start position:0%
we've had a running joke in my house
 
05:17:32.590 --> 05:17:32.600 align:start position:0%
that our dog and my campaign manager
 
05:17:34.990 --> 05:17:35.000 align:start position:0%
Skittles would befriend one someday and
 
05:17:37.868 --> 05:17:37.878 align:start position:0%
become a mischievous Duo uh some quick
 
05:17:39.830 --> 05:17:39.840 align:start position:0%
stats on the number of states where it's
 
05:17:42.190 --> 05:17:42.200 align:start position:0%
legal to own the animals on the list uh
 
05:17:46.548 --> 05:17:46.558 align:start position:0%
monkeys 31 uh raccoons 16 otter and fox
 
05:17:50.190 --> 05:17:50.200 align:start position:0%
are both 15 skunks 14 and finally
 
05:17:53.430 --> 05:17:53.440 align:start position:0%
kangaroos three without a permit in 10
 
05:17:55.830 --> 05:17:55.840 align:start position:0%
with I do not like to see other states
 
05:17:58.190 --> 05:17:58.200 align:start position:0%
outdoing New Hampshire we've been ranked
 
05:17:59.910 --> 05:17:59.920 align:start position:0%
the number one freest state in the
 
05:18:01.910 --> 05:18:01.920 align:start position:0%
nation for many years running
 
05:18:04.390 --> 05:18:04.400 align:start position:0%
but as evidenced here there's always
 
05:18:06.548 --> 05:18:06.558 align:start position:0%
room to
 
05:18:09.548 --> 05:18:09.558 align:start position:0%
expand I've heard concerns about rabies
 
05:18:11.708 --> 05:18:11.718 align:start position:0%
which I found odd because any mammal can
 
05:18:13.788 --> 05:18:13.798 align:start position:0%
get rabies it's not unique to raccoons
 
05:18:16.310 --> 05:18:16.320 align:start position:0%
and skunks and any competent animal
 
05:18:18.150 --> 05:18:18.160 align:start position:0%
owner will vaccinate their pets against
 
05:18:19.990 --> 05:18:20.000 align:start position:0%
it as with all things personal
 
05:18:21.910 --> 05:18:21.920 align:start position:0%
responsibility is the pathway to keeping
 
05:18:24.830 --> 05:18:24.840 align:start position:0%
your pets and family safe and healthy
 
05:18:29.270 --> 05:18:29.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:31.910 --> 05:18:31.920 align:start position:0%
questions okay uh let's see see all
 
05:18:34.190 --> 05:18:34.200 align:start position:0%
hands at once uh representative kulon
 
05:18:36.910 --> 05:18:36.920 align:start position:0%
and we'll work our way down thank you
 
05:18:38.868 --> 05:18:38.878 align:start position:0%
madam chair and thank you for taking my
 
05:18:40.830 --> 05:18:40.840 align:start position:0%
question representative Manion I don't
 
05:18:43.510 --> 05:18:43.520 align:start position:0%
have any science on this and it could
 
05:18:46.310 --> 05:18:46.320 align:start position:0%
just be a rumor but I did hear that
 
05:18:49.670 --> 05:18:49.680 align:start position:0%
kangaroos are actually deer that have
 
05:18:52.948 --> 05:18:52.958 align:start position:0%
been the prison so do you think there
 
05:18:56.948 --> 05:18:56.958 align:start position:0%
could be a uh you know a conflict of
 
05:18:59.990 --> 05:19:00.000 align:start position:0%
interest by bringing in these animals
 
05:19:02.470 --> 05:19:02.480 align:start position:0%
that could have you know a
 
05:19:05.628 --> 05:19:05.638 align:start position:0%
could have a advantage over our native
 
05:19:08.708 --> 05:19:08.718 align:start position:0%
animals I I also not a scientist I don't
 
05:19:10.350 --> 05:19:10.360 align:start position:0%
know if there would be competition in
 
05:19:11.910 --> 05:19:11.920 align:start position:0%
that same
 
05:19:11.920 --> 05:19:13.948 align:start position:0%
that same
field

05:19:13.948 --> 05:19:13.958 align:start position:0%
field
 
05:19:13.958 --> 05:19:16.510 align:start position:0%
field
representative

05:19:16.510 --> 05:19:16.520 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:19:19.548 --> 05:19:19.558 align:start position:0%
Howard would um would rabies vaccines
 
05:19:21.830 --> 05:19:21.840 align:start position:0%
for for pets that we already have work
 
05:19:23.510 --> 05:19:23.520 align:start position:0%
on the animals that you're talking about
 
05:19:25.350 --> 05:19:25.360 align:start position:0%
or would they have to develop um
 
05:19:28.110 --> 05:19:28.120 align:start position:0%
vaccines for each animal I would have to
 
05:19:30.910 --> 05:19:30.920 align:start position:0%
I'd have to defer to a immunologist I
 
05:19:33.510 --> 05:19:33.520 align:start position:0%
wouldn't think I mean do we humans take
 
05:19:35.990 --> 05:19:36.000 align:start position:0%
the same ra rabies vaccine if we get bit
 
05:19:38.750 --> 05:19:38.760 align:start position:0%
I would assume not the same no I mean
 
05:19:41.310 --> 05:19:41.320 align:start position:0%
mammals could be different per
 
05:19:45.390 --> 05:19:45.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:48.788 --> 05:19:48.798 align:start position:0%
Penza so is there a constituent or you
 
05:19:51.190 --> 05:19:51.200 align:start position:0%
know an entity here that wants one of
 
05:19:54.310 --> 05:19:54.320 align:start position:0%
these creatures yeah uh so the Twitter
 
05:19:55.830 --> 05:19:55.840 align:start position:0%
thread I verified that everybody who
 
05:19:57.230 --> 05:19:57.240 align:start position:0%
asked for something there was a longer
 
05:19:59.190 --> 05:19:59.200 align:start position:0%
list but the people that I verified
 
05:20:00.590 --> 05:20:00.600 align:start position:0%
actually live in New Hampshire were the
 
05:20:02.548 --> 05:20:02.558 align:start position:0%
only ones who made the cut if you want
 
05:20:04.788 --> 05:20:04.798 align:start position:0%
good representation you got to move here
 
05:20:06.590 --> 05:20:06.600 align:start position:0%
follow up follow
 
05:20:10.708 --> 05:20:10.718 align:start position:0%
up so I watched a a video of a skunk
 
05:20:12.910 --> 05:20:12.920 align:start position:0%
that was deskunked and it was like it
 
05:20:15.670 --> 05:20:15.680 align:start position:0%
was this great like pet or whatever so
 
05:20:17.788 --> 05:20:17.798 align:start position:0%
is that that's I mean they do do that
 
05:20:19.750 --> 05:20:19.760 align:start position:0%
right yes yeah and the same thing with
 
05:20:21.070 --> 05:20:21.080 align:start position:0%
raccoons like raccoons are pretty
 
05:20:22.510 --> 05:20:22.520 align:start position:0%
friendly I've watched like that's where
 
05:20:23.948 --> 05:20:23.958 align:start position:0%
this whole joke came with my uh
 
05:20:25.830 --> 05:20:25.840 align:start position:0%
girlfriend she loves raccoon videos and
 
05:20:28.110 --> 05:20:28.120 align:start position:0%
watching them be raised like
 
05:20:31.190 --> 05:20:31.200 align:start position:0%
cats okay represent Murray uh thank you
 
05:20:33.190 --> 05:20:33.200 align:start position:0%
Madam chair um thank you to the uh
 
05:20:35.150 --> 05:20:35.160 align:start position:0%
sponsor for taking my question I did
 
05:20:37.270 --> 05:20:37.280 align:start position:0%
have one question around some of the
 
05:20:39.470 --> 05:20:39.480 align:start position:0%
animals that you named I know that in
 
05:20:41.990 --> 05:20:42.000 align:start position:0%
various sorts of um whether it's
 
05:20:43.788 --> 05:20:43.798 align:start position:0%
Wildlife settings or Rehabilitation
 
05:20:46.070 --> 05:20:46.080 align:start position:0%
settings not only do the animals
 
05:20:49.670 --> 05:20:49.680 align:start position:0%
themselves have to be um vaccinated for
 
05:20:51.948 --> 05:20:51.958 align:start position:0%
rabies but um are you aware that there
 
05:20:53.990 --> 05:20:54.000 align:start position:0%
also the handlers who might be handling
 
05:20:55.868 --> 05:20:55.878 align:start position:0%
these animals also have to be
 
05:20:58.548 --> 05:20:58.558 align:start position:0%
prophylactically um vaccinated because
 
05:21:00.628 --> 05:21:00.638 align:start position:0%
of the high instance for example with
 
05:21:02.110 --> 05:21:02.120 align:start position:0%
monkey for
 
05:21:04.270 --> 05:21:04.280 align:start position:0%
example that that I'm not aware of I'm
 
05:21:06.470 --> 05:21:06.480 align:start position:0%
not but as with as I said like
 
05:21:07.548 --> 05:21:07.558 align:start position:0%
everything comes down to personal
 
05:21:09.150 --> 05:21:09.160 align:start position:0%
responsibility if you want to own like
 
05:21:10.868 --> 05:21:10.878 align:start position:0%
an exotic animal of some type you should
 
05:21:12.548 --> 05:21:12.558 align:start position:0%
take all the precautions necessary as an
 
05:21:17.430 --> 05:21:17.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:19.670 --> 05:21:19.680 align:start position:0%
neighbors any other questions from the
 
05:21:21.590 --> 05:21:21.600 align:start position:0%
committee representative
 
05:21:23.510 --> 05:21:23.520 align:start position:0%
Gera thank you madam chair and thank you
 
05:21:24.948 --> 05:21:24.958 align:start position:0%
for taking my question I I I think in
 
05:21:26.430 --> 05:21:26.440 align:start position:0%
particular I have a question about
 
05:21:28.750 --> 05:21:28.760 align:start position:0%
kangaroos in in the sense that I'm just
 
05:21:31.350 --> 05:21:31.360 align:start position:0%
wondering what type of Veterinary
 
05:21:33.628 --> 05:21:33.638 align:start position:0%
expertise exists in the state and I
 
05:21:35.670 --> 05:21:35.680 align:start position:0%
understand of course if if we were to to
 
05:21:36.628 --> 05:21:36.638 align:start position:0%
pass this
 
05:21:39.310 --> 05:21:39.320 align:start position:0%
bill there's a market right people could
 
05:21:42.750 --> 05:21:42.760 align:start position:0%
move here to become kangaroo vets uh but
 
05:21:45.830 --> 05:21:45.840 align:start position:0%
it in the meantime or in parts of the
 
05:21:47.548 --> 05:21:47.558 align:start position:0%
state which will not benefit from the
 
05:21:50.110 --> 05:21:50.120 align:start position:0%
service of kangaroo vets um do you have
 
05:21:52.470 --> 05:21:52.480 align:start position:0%
any concern that even the the most
 
05:21:52.480 --> 05:21:53.708 align:start position:0%
any concern that even the the most
well-intentioned

05:21:53.708 --> 05:21:53.718 align:start position:0%
well-intentioned
 
05:21:56.430 --> 05:21:56.440 align:start position:0%
owner is going to be very limited in
 
05:21:58.110 --> 05:21:58.120 align:start position:0%
their ability to provide adequate
 
05:22:01.350 --> 05:22:01.360 align:start position:0%
medical care for kangaroos it's a risk
 
05:22:02.910 --> 05:22:02.920 align:start position:0%
like so if you're going to take on a pet
 
05:22:04.350 --> 05:22:04.360 align:start position:0%
you need to understand the risk of any
 
05:22:06.590 --> 05:22:06.600 align:start position:0%
kind of animal and I agree that exactly
 
05:22:08.230 --> 05:22:08.240 align:start position:0%
what you just described is what I think
 
05:22:09.470 --> 05:22:09.480 align:start position:0%
if there is a there's currently no
 
05:22:11.310 --> 05:22:11.320 align:start position:0%
market for that type of Veterinary Care
 
05:22:12.628 --> 05:22:12.638 align:start position:0%
in the state because you can't own these
 
05:22:14.590 --> 05:22:14.600 align:start position:0%
things unless you're an exhibitor so
 
05:22:16.350 --> 05:22:16.360 align:start position:0%
right now it's limited to exhibitors but
 
05:22:17.708 --> 05:22:17.718 align:start position:0%
if they became an open market where
 
05:22:18.868 --> 05:22:18.878 align:start position:0%
people are allowed to own these I
 
05:22:20.868 --> 05:22:20.878 align:start position:0%
believe it would it would bring in new
 
05:22:25.270 --> 05:22:25.280 align:start position:0%
types of Veterinary Care thank
 
05:22:29.190 --> 05:22:29.200 align:start position:0%
you represent Bixby so I was uh doing a
 
05:22:31.590 --> 05:22:31.600 align:start position:0%
little bit of reading online and I found
 
05:22:35.110 --> 05:22:35.120 align:start position:0%
a website of a uh a place in British
 
05:22:39.030 --> 05:22:39.040 align:start position:0%
Columbia that Farms Kangaroos and they
 
05:22:41.030 --> 05:22:41.040 align:start position:0%
one of the things they commented was
 
05:22:43.868 --> 05:22:43.878 align:start position:0%
that uh when the kangaroos are very
 
05:22:46.990 --> 05:22:47.000 align:start position:0%
small when they're joies uh they're it's
 
05:22:50.030 --> 05:22:50.040 align:start position:0%
okay to have them in the house but once
 
05:22:52.150 --> 05:22:52.160 align:start position:0%
they get older it is absolutely
 
05:22:54.110 --> 05:22:54.120 align:start position:0%
impossible to house train them they are
 
05:22:55.708 --> 05:22:55.718 align:start position:0%
they are highly destructive and they
 
05:22:58.230 --> 05:22:58.240 align:start position:0%
leave their um droppings all over the
 
05:23:00.548 --> 05:23:00.558 align:start position:0%
place and I'm wondering if you have had
 
05:23:02.590 --> 05:23:02.600 align:start position:0%
any reports from people who have had
 
05:23:04.628 --> 05:23:04.638 align:start position:0%
tried to have kangaroos as pets and
 
05:23:07.310 --> 05:23:07.320 align:start position:0%
whether there has been a problem with
 
05:23:08.910 --> 05:23:08.920 align:start position:0%
that sort of help
 
05:23:11.030 --> 05:23:11.040 align:start position:0%
Hazard the entire reason the kangaroo
 
05:23:12.350 --> 05:23:12.360 align:start position:0%
made it the list because I verified that
 
05:23:13.910 --> 05:23:13.920 align:start position:0%
the guy who asked for the kangaroos
 
05:23:15.548 --> 05:23:15.558 align:start position:0%
lived in New Hampshire I'm not aware of
 
05:23:17.470 --> 05:23:17.480 align:start position:0%
anybody who has these as pets I've seen
 
05:23:19.510 --> 05:23:19.520 align:start position:0%
a lot of exotic footage of people owning
 
05:23:21.990 --> 05:23:22.000 align:start position:0%
things like uh links and snow tigers and
 
05:23:24.230 --> 05:23:24.240 align:start position:0%
things like that like even crazier in my
 
05:23:25.670 --> 05:23:25.680 align:start position:0%
opinion pets and people seem to do
 
05:23:27.750 --> 05:23:27.760 align:start position:0%
pretty well with those uh I would not
 
05:23:29.430 --> 05:23:29.440 align:start position:0%
suggest leaving a kangaroo in your home
 
05:23:31.350 --> 05:23:31.360 align:start position:0%
but like people ALS some people uh raise
 
05:23:32.708 --> 05:23:32.718 align:start position:0%
you know farm animals and things like
 
05:23:34.270 --> 05:23:34.280 align:start position:0%
that you're not gonna I mean most people
 
05:23:35.830 --> 05:23:35.840 align:start position:0%
aren't going to allow their like cows to
 
05:23:37.030 --> 05:23:37.040 align:start position:0%
walk around in their home they'll have
 
05:23:39.910 --> 05:23:39.920 align:start position:0%
somewhere for them to to
 
05:23:44.110 --> 05:23:44.120 align:start position:0%
bed um I you know I did uh discuss this
 
05:23:46.150 --> 05:23:46.160 align:start position:0%
bill with my own
 
05:23:49.788 --> 05:23:49.798 align:start position:0%
veterinarian um and she was saying how
 
05:23:54.110 --> 05:23:54.120 align:start position:0%
the majority of the animals listed here
 
05:23:56.030 --> 05:23:56.040 align:start position:0%
well all of them small tail monkeys
 
05:23:59.150 --> 05:23:59.160 align:start position:0%
raccoons foxes otter maybe not skunks
 
05:24:02.310 --> 05:24:02.320 align:start position:0%
but kangaroos that um they require
 
05:24:05.910 --> 05:24:05.920 align:start position:0%
certain habitats in order to live a
 
05:24:12.150 --> 05:24:12.160 align:start position:0%
healthy and um I guess animal rewarding
 
05:24:16.548 --> 05:24:16.558 align:start position:0%
life would you not find that um keeping
 
05:24:21.070 --> 05:24:21.080 align:start position:0%
these animals in a home or maybe in a
 
05:24:24.548 --> 05:24:24.558 align:start position:0%
habitat that's not you know uh that
 
05:24:27.830 --> 05:24:27.840 align:start position:0%
something that these animals belong in
 
05:24:30.590 --> 05:24:30.600 align:start position:0%
do you find that that would be um kind
 
05:24:33.150 --> 05:24:33.160 align:start position:0%
of of cruel to them it could be uh like
 
05:24:34.948 --> 05:24:34.958 align:start position:0%
I would say that all this goes back to
 
05:24:35.830 --> 05:24:35.840 align:start position:0%
what I said about personal
 
05:24:37.150 --> 05:24:37.160 align:start position:0%
responsibility if you want to raise your
 
05:24:38.548 --> 05:24:38.558 align:start position:0%
animal to be as happy as possible you
 
05:24:40.190 --> 05:24:40.200 align:start position:0%
want to give them enough room like if
 
05:24:41.670 --> 05:24:41.680 align:start position:0%
you own a Husky and you don't and you
 
05:24:43.030 --> 05:24:43.040 align:start position:0%
like live in a small apartment that's
 
05:24:44.350 --> 05:24:44.360 align:start position:0%
not going to be great for the Husky the
 
05:24:46.270 --> 05:24:46.280 align:start position:0%
Husky wants to run it's a running breed
 
05:24:47.910 --> 05:24:47.920 align:start position:0%
so even in current animals that we own
 
05:24:49.628 --> 05:24:49.638 align:start position:0%
now you want to make sure that when you
 
05:24:51.270 --> 05:24:51.280 align:start position:0%
pick your pet for your family that you
 
05:24:53.310 --> 05:24:53.320 align:start position:0%
have the space to accommodate the animal
 
05:24:54.830 --> 05:24:54.840 align:start position:0%
that you want I would say that applies
 
05:24:58.150 --> 05:24:58.160 align:start position:0%
to all of these as well representative
 
05:25:00.390 --> 05:25:00.400 align:start position:0%
ktoa thank you madam chair and thank you
 
05:25:02.510 --> 05:25:02.520 align:start position:0%
repres for taking my question uh first
 
05:25:05.948 --> 05:25:05.958 align:start position:0%
off can you email uh your testimony yes
 
05:25:10.350 --> 05:25:10.360 align:start position:0%
yep okay thank you may I you may um
 
05:25:13.868 --> 05:25:13.878 align:start position:0%
would you believe that um just down the
 
05:25:16.470 --> 05:25:16.480 align:start position:0%
street from us uh for several years uh
 
05:25:18.110 --> 05:25:18.120 align:start position:0%
they're no longer there but we used to
 
05:25:18.990 --> 05:25:19.000 align:start position:0%
have a
 
05:25:21.590 --> 05:25:21.600 align:start position:0%
camel uh that uh someone had brought
 
05:25:24.150 --> 05:25:24.160 align:start position:0%
over they worked with the state
 
05:25:27.430 --> 05:25:27.440 align:start position:0%
department um and was able to bring
 
05:25:30.990 --> 05:25:31.000 align:start position:0%
their camel over that they had as um
 
05:25:33.910 --> 05:25:33.920 align:start position:0%
when they lived overseas and it actually
 
05:25:37.270 --> 05:25:37.280 align:start position:0%
thrived uh and had quite a great life
 
05:25:39.190 --> 05:25:39.200 align:start position:0%
that's great I mean I I would believe
 
05:25:41.948 --> 05:25:41.958 align:start position:0%
that that's great and so and I also have
 
05:25:44.390 --> 05:25:44.400 align:start position:0%
a question with regard to you know how
 
05:25:47.030 --> 05:25:47.040 align:start position:0%
we have
 
05:25:50.310 --> 05:25:50.320 align:start position:0%
um licenses for certain animals dogs
 
05:25:52.470 --> 05:25:52.480 align:start position:0%
cats ferrets and they have to get rabies
 
05:25:55.510 --> 05:25:55.520 align:start position:0%
shots and so and so forth how how would
 
05:25:59.590 --> 05:25:59.600 align:start position:0%
you see this also U working into that
 
05:26:02.390 --> 05:26:02.400 align:start position:0%
scenario would you think that these
 
05:26:06.270 --> 05:26:06.280 align:start position:0%
animals should be um monitored or
 
05:26:08.708 --> 05:26:08.718 align:start position:0%
tracked by the state
 
05:26:12.030 --> 05:26:12.040 align:start position:0%
to should we uh keep track of people who
 
05:26:15.350 --> 05:26:15.360 align:start position:0%
breed these animals um I I am not a fan
 
05:26:17.270 --> 05:26:17.280 align:start position:0%
of any kind of government list for any
 
05:26:18.670 --> 05:26:18.680 align:start position:0%
people being on them whether it be
 
05:26:20.750 --> 05:26:20.760 align:start position:0%
animals or otherwise I I would be
 
05:26:23.030 --> 05:26:23.040 align:start position:0%
opposed to that but you know if that's
 
05:26:24.548 --> 05:26:24.558 align:start position:0%
how what's required to get this out of
 
05:26:26.030 --> 05:26:26.040 align:start position:0%
the committee I suppose that's something
 
05:26:28.190 --> 05:26:28.200 align:start position:0%
I'd be amenable to I'm willing to
 
05:26:31.310 --> 05:26:31.320 align:start position:0%
compromise representative Howard
 
05:26:33.110 --> 05:26:33.120 align:start position:0%
so this seems a little bit frivilous to
 
05:26:34.510 --> 05:26:34.520 align:start position:0%
me and I'm just wondering do you think
 
05:26:36.110 --> 05:26:36.120 align:start position:0%
that these people that you contacted
 
05:26:37.990 --> 05:26:38.000 align:start position:0%
through Twitter would be asking for
 
05:26:39.910 --> 05:26:39.920 align:start position:0%
these pets if you hadn't put that out
 
05:26:43.190 --> 05:26:43.200 align:start position:0%
there as sort of a they asked first they
 
05:26:44.628 --> 05:26:44.638 align:start position:0%
asked first yes so you heard from them
 
05:26:46.390 --> 05:26:46.400 align:start position:0%
on Twitter yes they they they know that
 
05:26:49.430 --> 05:26:49.440 align:start position:0%
I'm you know uh willing to put things in
 
05:26:50.910 --> 05:26:50.920 align:start position:0%
for people sometimes people don't have
 
05:26:52.270 --> 05:26:52.280 align:start position:0%
good representation where they live and
 
05:26:53.150 --> 05:26:53.160 align:start position:0%
when they reach out to their
 
05:26:55.310 --> 05:26:55.320 align:start position:0%
representatives they don't answer they
 
05:26:57.708 --> 05:26:57.718 align:start position:0%
don't reply and I think I'm trying to
 
05:26:59.948 --> 05:26:59.958 align:start position:0%
bridge the gap there and try to be as
 
05:27:01.310 --> 05:27:01.320 align:start position:0%
accessible as
 
05:27:03.190 --> 05:27:03.200 align:start position:0%
possible any other questions
 
05:27:05.590 --> 05:27:05.600 align:start position:0%
representative Murray um thank you madam
 
05:27:06.990 --> 05:27:07.000 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking my
 
05:27:09.270 --> 05:27:09.280 align:start position:0%
question and um if if you can't answer
 
05:27:11.070 --> 05:27:11.080 align:start position:0%
this maybe somebody after you can can
 
05:27:12.590 --> 05:27:12.600 align:start position:0%
answer this do you have any concern
 
05:27:14.910 --> 05:27:14.920 align:start position:0%
about potential um illegal trade or
 
05:27:18.030 --> 05:27:18.040 align:start position:0%
illegal sourcing of animals that might
 
05:27:21.510 --> 05:27:21.520 align:start position:0%
um come about as a result of a peace
 
05:27:23.350 --> 05:27:23.360 align:start position:0%
policy like
 
05:27:26.190 --> 05:27:26.200 align:start position:0%
this not really I mean in what what do
 
05:27:29.510 --> 05:27:29.520 align:start position:0%
you mean like like smuggling
 
05:27:29.520 --> 05:27:32.350 align:start position:0%
you mean like like smuggling
kangaroos

05:27:32.350 --> 05:27:32.360 align:start position:0%
kangaroos
 
05:27:35.510 --> 05:27:35.520 align:start position:0%
good second followup or yeah yeah I'm
 
05:27:38.590 --> 05:27:38.600 align:start position:0%
sorry just clarify so so yeah with
 
05:27:40.390 --> 05:27:40.400 align:start position:0%
regard to a myriad of types of animals
 
05:27:43.030 --> 05:27:43.040 align:start position:0%
that we already know make it into our
 
05:27:45.070 --> 05:27:45.080 align:start position:0%
ports of entry in various different ways
 
05:27:47.990 --> 05:27:48.000 align:start position:0%
that are not suitable for environments
 
05:27:50.070 --> 05:27:50.080 align:start position:0%
here in the United States do you have
 
05:27:51.670 --> 05:27:51.680 align:start position:0%
any indication of whether or not this
 
05:27:52.830 --> 05:27:52.840 align:start position:0%
may increase
 
05:27:55.110 --> 05:27:55.120 align:start position:0%
that I don't have any indication on that
 
05:27:56.990 --> 05:27:57.000 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure if this would affect it I
 
05:27:58.150 --> 05:27:58.160 align:start position:0%
don't know anybody who's smuggling
 
05:27:59.788 --> 05:27:59.798 align:start position:0%
kangaroos in and if they were legalized
 
05:28:01.548 --> 05:28:01.558 align:start position:0%
I don't think it increase or decrease
 
05:28:03.750 --> 05:28:03.760 align:start position:0%
one way or the other representative
 
05:28:05.910 --> 05:28:05.920 align:start position:0%
ktoa thank you madam chair and thank you
 
05:28:07.670 --> 05:28:07.680 align:start position:0%
again for taking my question you
 
05:28:10.910 --> 05:28:10.920 align:start position:0%
mentioned that several States uh allowed
 
05:28:14.070 --> 05:28:14.080 align:start position:0%
um these animals have you looked into
 
05:28:16.868 --> 05:28:16.878 align:start position:0%
seeing what the requirements were for uh
 
05:28:19.350 --> 05:28:19.360 align:start position:0%
letting the animals there uh in a lot of
 
05:28:20.910 --> 05:28:20.920 align:start position:0%
these cases it's as simple as there's
 
05:28:24.510 --> 05:28:24.520 align:start position:0%
just no uh ban on them so it's like uh
 
05:28:26.070 --> 05:28:26.080 align:start position:0%
with the way that our fishing game is
 
05:28:27.430 --> 05:28:27.440 align:start position:0%
currently set up is they have this big
 
05:28:28.830 --> 05:28:28.840 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet and that's how I found all
 
05:28:31.190 --> 05:28:31.200 align:start position:0%
this out and uh they basically list
 
05:28:33.110 --> 05:28:33.120 align:start position:0%
everything that isn't like a fet or you
 
05:28:36.628 --> 05:28:36.638 align:start position:0%
know a dog a cat Etc as you need a a
 
05:28:38.590 --> 05:28:38.600 align:start position:0%
special license to be an exhibitor most
 
05:28:39.750 --> 05:28:39.760 align:start position:0%
of like a lot of these states on the
 
05:28:41.390 --> 05:28:41.400 align:start position:0%
list don't have something like that it's
 
05:28:43.708 --> 05:28:43.718 align:start position:0%
just not banned not prohibited not
 
05:28:45.190 --> 05:28:45.200 align:start position:0%
required a
 
05:28:49.110 --> 05:28:49.120 align:start position:0%
license so you were saying then that um
 
05:28:51.190 --> 05:28:51.200 align:start position:0%
people can own these animals like if
 
05:28:54.708 --> 05:28:54.718 align:start position:0%
they have a zoo or um in the state or or
 
05:28:58.110 --> 05:28:58.120 align:start position:0%
a some kind of animal um Education
 
05:29:00.628 --> 05:29:00.638 align:start position:0%
Center or something correct so it's like
 
05:29:02.150 --> 05:29:02.160 align:start position:0%
they call it it's classification number
 
05:29:04.070 --> 05:29:04.080 align:start position:0%
five under the fishing game here it's uh
 
05:29:07.310 --> 05:29:07.320 align:start position:0%
says specifically an exe an exhibitor sh
 
05:29:09.350 --> 05:29:09.360 align:start position:0%
be permit Carri category five and that
 
05:29:11.110 --> 05:29:11.120 align:start position:0%
was basically every animal on this list
 
05:29:13.548 --> 05:29:13.558 align:start position:0%
qualifies under that as an exhibitor
 
05:29:17.990 --> 05:29:18.000 align:start position:0%
okay thank you represent
 
05:29:20.350 --> 05:29:20.360 align:start position:0%
Penza I'm trying to remember the name of
 
05:29:21.708 --> 05:29:21.718 align:start position:0%
the company there was a company that
 
05:29:24.350 --> 05:29:24.360 align:start position:0%
used to come around um it was from the
 
05:29:26.150 --> 05:29:26.160 align:start position:0%
time my kids were little and they would
 
05:29:29.150 --> 05:29:29.160 align:start position:0%
bring exotic animals uh reptiles and
 
05:29:30.830 --> 05:29:30.840 align:start position:0%
snakes uh
 
05:29:33.548 --> 05:29:33.558 align:start position:0%
Bobcat um I don't think there was a
 
05:29:37.110 --> 05:29:37.120 align:start position:0%
kangaroo but um but in any case
 
05:29:39.708 --> 05:29:39.718 align:start position:0%
so they already have to have some sort
 
05:29:41.868 --> 05:29:41.878 align:start position:0%
of Licensing right or are you kind of
 
05:29:44.430 --> 05:29:44.440 align:start position:0%
trying to wipe that out I'm basic I
 
05:29:46.150 --> 05:29:46.160 align:start position:0%
wanted a private ownership like so you
 
05:29:47.788 --> 05:29:47.798 align:start position:0%
don't have to be an exhibitor if you if
 
05:29:49.150 --> 05:29:49.160 align:start position:0%
you'd like to own some of these animals
 
05:29:51.628 --> 05:29:51.638 align:start position:0%
you don't have to be in like a own a zoo
 
05:29:54.430 --> 05:29:54.440 align:start position:0%
or traveling whatever followup
 
05:29:57.190 --> 05:29:57.200 align:start position:0%
followup so when we went to Kentucky
 
05:30:00.708 --> 05:30:00.718 align:start position:0%
they had um there was a I don't I call
 
05:30:02.788 --> 05:30:02.798 align:start position:0%
them I wouldn't call it a zoo but they
 
05:30:05.350 --> 05:30:05.360 align:start position:0%
had um kangaroos my daughters got to Pat
 
05:30:07.910 --> 05:30:07.920 align:start position:0%
the kangaroos they had a couple other
 
05:30:10.670 --> 05:30:10.680 align:start position:0%
exotic animals but they still would have
 
05:30:12.548 --> 05:30:12.558 align:start position:0%
to go through that process they had a
 
05:30:16.750 --> 05:30:16.760 align:start position:0%
nice outdoor oops um area for them um
 
05:30:19.190 --> 05:30:19.200 align:start position:0%
you know an enclosure when it got cold
 
05:30:21.868 --> 05:30:21.878 align:start position:0%
so so but you're still there would be
 
05:30:23.470 --> 05:30:23.480 align:start position:0%
nobody checking on that to know if
 
05:30:25.510 --> 05:30:25.520 align:start position:0%
they're actually treating these animals
 
05:30:27.948 --> 05:30:27.958 align:start position:0%
okay it based upon your bill basically
 
05:30:29.310 --> 05:30:29.320 align:start position:0%
that's what the bill says like I I don't
 
05:30:30.788 --> 05:30:30.798 align:start position:0%
want any harm to come to animals but
 
05:30:32.430 --> 05:30:32.440 align:start position:0%
like even animals that we don't check on
 
05:30:35.230 --> 05:30:35.240 align:start position:0%
now like dogs like it we don't have it's
 
05:30:36.868 --> 05:30:36.878 align:start position:0%
not where we go door to door and make
 
05:30:37.948 --> 05:30:37.958 align:start position:0%
sure that people aren't abusing their
 
05:30:42.230 --> 05:30:42.240 align:start position:0%
dogs either representing Bixby so it
 
05:30:44.070 --> 05:30:44.080 align:start position:0%
would seem that this that part of the
 
05:30:45.670 --> 05:30:45.680 align:start position:0%
issue here is the question of private
 
05:30:48.788 --> 05:30:48.798 align:start position:0%
ownership yes and uh I'm wondering if
 
05:30:50.590 --> 05:30:50.600 align:start position:0%
there's anything different between the
 
05:30:54.310 --> 05:30:54.320 align:start position:0%
private ownership of say a Tesla versus
 
05:30:59.070 --> 05:30:59.080 align:start position:0%
a live animal a Tesla yeah or a you know
 
05:31:02.788 --> 05:31:02.798 align:start position:0%
a Subaru or like you know a car and
 
05:31:05.190 --> 05:31:05.200 align:start position:0%
what's the difference between owning a a
 
05:31:07.470 --> 05:31:07.480 align:start position:0%
non-an animate object like a car and
 
05:31:10.750 --> 05:31:10.760 align:start position:0%
being responsible for it versus uh an
 
05:31:14.030 --> 05:31:14.040 align:start position:0%
animal to me very little I I don't see
 
05:31:15.750 --> 05:31:15.760 align:start position:0%
any distinction like if you you own one
 
05:31:19.150 --> 05:31:19.160 align:start position:0%
thing you own another thing thank
 
05:31:21.868 --> 05:31:21.878 align:start position:0%
you okay any other
 
05:31:24.310 --> 05:31:24.320 align:start position:0%
questions thank you for your testim
 
05:31:27.590 --> 05:31:27.600 align:start position:0%

05:34:50.750 --> 05:34:50.760 align:start position:0%
2018 involved animals who were
 
05:34:53.390 --> 05:34:53.400 align:start position:0%
apparently kept as pets these animals
 
05:34:55.750 --> 05:34:55.760 align:start position:0%
may never be found or are sometimes
 
05:34:58.868 --> 05:34:58.878 align:start position:0%
found dead it is also not unusual for
 
05:35:01.430 --> 05:35:01.440 align:start position:0%
the local police Animal Control to
 
05:35:04.548 --> 05:35:04.558 align:start position:0%
expend countless resources attempting to
 
05:35:07.070 --> 05:35:07.080 align:start position:0%
locate and capture escaped
 
05:35:09.910 --> 05:35:09.920 align:start position:0%
kangaroos for example in 2020 an
 
05:35:12.510 --> 05:35:12.520 align:start position:0%
8-month-old kangaroo purchased as a pet
 
05:35:15.070 --> 05:35:15.080 align:start position:0%
a day earlier from a breeder in
 
05:35:17.030 --> 05:35:17.040 align:start position:0%
Washington escaped from a van he was
 
05:35:19.990 --> 05:35:20.000 align:start position:0%
being kept in after a 7-hour search that
 
05:35:22.868 --> 05:35:22.878 align:start position:0%
included using a drone and going door
 
05:35:25.510 --> 05:35:25.520 align:start position:0%
too police found the kangaroo in what
 
05:35:28.110 --> 05:35:28.120 align:start position:0%
they described as pretty bad shape in a
 
05:35:30.390 --> 05:35:30.400 align:start position:0%
neighbor's carport and transported the
 
05:35:33.070 --> 05:35:33.080 align:start position:0%
kangaroo to an animal hospital with
 
05:35:35.948 --> 05:35:35.958 align:start position:0%
their long muscular tail powerful hind
 
05:35:39.510 --> 05:35:39.520 align:start position:0%
legs and Dagger like toenails that can
 
05:35:42.230 --> 05:35:42.240 align:start position:0%
inflict Serious injury to people
 
05:35:45.750 --> 05:35:45.760 align:start position:0%
kangaroos can be quite dangerous in 2017
 
05:35:47.510 --> 05:35:47.520 align:start position:0%
a little girl visiting an Alabama
 
05:35:49.548 --> 05:35:49.558 align:start position:0%
petting zoo learned how dangerous
 
05:35:52.110 --> 05:35:52.120 align:start position:0%
kangaroos can be when one grabbed her
 
05:35:54.470 --> 05:35:54.480 align:start position:0%
through the fence and started biting her
 
05:35:57.390 --> 05:35:57.400 align:start position:0%
head causing lacerations that required
 
05:36:01.190 --> 05:36:01.200 align:start position:0%
14 stitches in another a visitor went to
 
05:36:03.030 --> 05:36:03.040 align:start position:0%
an urgent care center to receive a
 
05:36:06.910 --> 05:36:06.920 align:start position:0%
tetanus toxoid vaccine after being
 
05:36:09.510 --> 05:36:09.520 align:start position:0%
bitten while petting a young kangaroo
 
05:36:11.910 --> 05:36:11.920 align:start position:0%
and an Ohio man was hospitalized
 
05:36:15.750 --> 05:36:15.760 align:start position:0%
following a 15minute attack by his 6

05:36:22.030 --> 05:36:22.040 align:start position:0%
kangaroo I mean I could go on I know
 
05:36:25.868 --> 05:36:25.878 align:start position:0%
again for time otter are among the C
 
05:36:27.830 --> 05:36:27.840 align:start position:0%
among the captive animals in the US that
 
05:36:30.868 --> 05:36:30.878 align:start position:0%
have been infected with covid-19
 
05:36:32.590 --> 05:36:32.600 align:start position:0%
as a result the US Department of
 
05:36:34.868 --> 05:36:34.878 align:start position:0%
Agriculture has advised licensed
 
05:36:37.788 --> 05:36:37.798 align:start position:0%

05:37:00.948 --> 05:37:00.958 align:start position:0%
also been reports of otters dying from
 
05:37:03.990 --> 05:37:04.000 align:start position:0%
the stress of transport and handling by
 
05:37:09.030 --> 05:37:09.040 align:start position:0%

05:37:18.670 --> 05:37:18.680 align:start position:0%
and pro pro marians it is unclear what
 
05:37:21.590 --> 05:37:21.600 align:start position:0%
is meant by small-tailed monkeys in this
 
05:37:23.708 --> 05:37:23.718 align:start position:0%
bill in HB
 
05:37:26.708 --> 05:37:26.718 align:start position:0%
1325 but primatologists agree that no
 
05:37:29.350 --> 05:37:29.360 align:start position:0%
species of primate is suitable suitable
 
05:37:30.990 --> 05:37:31.000 align:start position:0%
for for keeping as a
 
05:37:34.670 --> 05:37:34.680 align:start position:0%
pet primates are proportionately much
 
05:37:36.910 --> 05:37:36.920 align:start position:0%
stronger than people and as a result
 
05:37:39.670 --> 05:37:39.680 align:start position:0%
even smaller species can inflict Serious
 
05:37:42.030 --> 05:37:42.040 align:start position:0%
injury primates can also spread
 
05:37:44.470 --> 05:37:44.480 align:start position:0%
life-threatening disease in fact more
 
05:37:46.910 --> 05:37:46.920 align:start position:0%
than a 100 zuntic diseases have been
 
05:37:49.788 --> 05:37:49.798 align:start position:0%
identified in primates primates
 
05:37:52.190 --> 05:37:52.200 align:start position:0%
including small monkeys are incredibly
 
05:37:54.628 --> 05:37:54.638 align:start position:0%
strong and become aggressive dangerous
 
05:37:57.590 --> 05:37:57.600 align:start position:0%
and unpredictable when they reach sexual
 
05:38:00.230 --> 05:38:00.240 align:start position:0%

05:38:03.030 --> 05:38:03.040 align:start position:0%

05:38:10.350 --> 05:38:10.360 align:start position:0%
um you know there are other more sort of
 
05:38:12.708 --> 05:38:12.718 align:start position:0%
nice reasons mother infant relationships
 
05:38:14.390 --> 05:38:14.400 align:start position:0%
are essential to the healthy physical
 
05:38:16.868 --> 05:38:16.878 align:start position:0%
and psychological development of the
 
05:38:21.190 --> 05:38:21.200 align:start position:0%
primate species if we care about uh the
 
05:38:22.910 --> 05:38:22.920 align:start position:0%
subjects we're talking about at all but
 
05:38:24.990 --> 05:38:25.000 align:start position:0%
I I mean I think I'll just sum that up
 
05:38:27.150 --> 05:38:27.160 align:start position:0%
in light of the over overwhelmingly
 
05:38:29.510 --> 05:38:29.520 align:start position:0%
public health and safety and animal
 
05:38:31.750 --> 05:38:31.760 align:start position:0%
welfare concerns associated with keeping
 
05:38:34.390 --> 05:38:34.400 align:start position:0%
wild animals as pets we urge you to

short-tailed monkey as a pet and um he
 
05:39:16.590 --> 05:39:16.600 align:start position:0%
said that they were
 
05:39:19.910 --> 05:39:19.920 align:start position:0%
virtually angry aggressive and vicious
 
05:39:22.030 --> 05:39:22.040 align:start position:0%

acted that way um that that you could
 
05:39:27.910 --> 05:39:27.920 align:start position:0%
never ever really train or control would

opportunity to testify on House Bill
 
05:40:30.590 --> 05:40:30.600 align:start position:0%
1325 on behalf of the Hampshire aabon
 
05:40:33.070 --> 05:40:33.080 align:start position:0%
House Bill 1325 would allow private

species of wildlife as companion animals
 
05:40:39.270 --> 05:40:39.280 align:start position:0%
without permits there are many reasons
 
05:40:41.788 --> 05:40:41.798 align:start position:0%
why this would be a public bad public
 
05:40:43.750 --> 05:40:43.760 align:start position:0%
policy in the interest of bvy I will
 
05:40:46.628 --> 05:40:46.638 align:start position:0%

caused as I had mentioned before I uh
 
05:43:21.270 --> 05:43:21.280 align:start position:0%
was a wildlife biologist in New
 
05:43:23.270 --> 05:43:23.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire for over three decades and
 
05:43:26.350 --> 05:43:26.360 align:start position:0%
dealt with some of these issues uh hey
 
05:43:28.190 --> 05:43:28.200 align:start position:0%
orph we got a rattlesnake for you to
 
05:43:29.750 --> 05:43:29.760 align:start position:0%
take care of
 
05:43:32.910 --> 05:43:32.920 align:start position:0%
so staff doesn't have experience to
 
05:43:35.590 --> 05:43:35.600 align:start position:0%
Monitor and take care of things that are
 
05:43:38.110 --> 05:43:38.120 align:start position:0%
exotic such as kangaro and some of those
 
05:43:40.868 --> 05:43:40.878 align:start position:0%
that are listed here and hopefully all
 
05:43:43.110 --> 05:43:43.120 align:start position:0%
of us in this room believe that raccoons
 
05:43:46.750 --> 05:43:46.760 align:start position:0%
and skunks and Otter foxes they're wild
 
05:43:49.030 --> 05:43:49.040 align:start position:0%
animals they belong in the wild not as
 
05:43:52.070 --> 05:43:52.080 align:start position:0%
someone's pets
 
05:43:55.150 --> 05:43:55.160 align:start position:0%
uh I guess to use a common used
 
05:43:57.150 --> 05:43:57.160 align:start position:0%
statement this kind of opens a can of
 
05:44:00.628 --> 05:44:00.638 align:start position:0%
worms that I think you New Hampshire is
 
05:44:02.510 --> 05:44:02.520 align:start position:0%
lucky and I'll tell you when I visit
 
05:44:05.230 --> 05:44:05.240 align:start position:0%
other states as a wildlife biologist
 
05:44:07.110 --> 05:44:07.120 align:start position:0%
they think New Hampshire is doing the
 
05:44:10.230 --> 05:44:10.240 align:start position:0%
right thing by prohibiting the uh
 
05:44:13.310 --> 05:44:13.320 align:start position:0%
importation of exotic pets as you see in
 
05:44:16.590 --> 05:44:16.600 align:start position:0%
some other states so I would uh ask that
 
05:44:19.350 --> 05:44:19.360 align:start position:0%
this committee not monkey wrong and find
 
05:44:22.788 --> 05:44:22.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:26.070 --> 05:44:26.080 align:start position:0%
legislate thank you Mr horf and uh
 
05:44:28.150 --> 05:44:28.160 align:start position:0%
representative Murray thank you madam
 
05:44:30.628 --> 05:44:30.638 align:start position:0%
chair you listed a a whole host of
 
05:44:33.310 --> 05:44:33.320 align:start position:0%
disease zoonotic diseases that um
 
05:44:35.750 --> 05:44:35.760 align:start position:0%
potentially could be of risk to the PO
 
05:44:37.910 --> 05:44:37.920 align:start position:0%
public population um one thing that I
 
05:44:40.350 --> 05:44:40.360 align:start position:0%
was curious about um was whether or not
 
05:44:41.830 --> 05:44:41.840 align:start position:0%
uh you had any concerns around the
 
05:44:44.030 --> 05:44:44.040 align:start position:0%
proper quarantine of set animals should
 
05:44:47.628 --> 05:44:47.638 align:start position:0%
this practice increase that people are
 
05:44:49.390 --> 05:44:49.400 align:start position:0%
um bringing these types of animals into
 
05:44:51.150 --> 05:44:51.160 align:start position:0%
their home environments whether or not
 
05:44:52.590 --> 05:44:52.600 align:start position:0%
that would be something that would be
 
05:44:52.600 --> 05:44:54.390 align:start position:0%
that would be something that would be
adhered

05:44:54.390 --> 05:44:54.400 align:start position:0%
adhered
 
05:44:57.868 --> 05:44:57.878 align:start position:0%
to well we know how people
 
05:45:01.310 --> 05:45:01.320 align:start position:0%
are it is some of these illegal animals
 
05:45:02.990 --> 05:45:03.000 align:start position:0%
are brought into the state and
 
05:45:06.030 --> 05:45:06.040 align:start position:0%
confiscated and Maria Colby just
 
05:45:08.670 --> 05:45:08.680 align:start position:0%
mentioned to me she has some pet skunks
 
05:45:11.110 --> 05:45:11.120 align:start position:0%
that were recently uh confiscated by the
 
05:45:13.708 --> 05:45:13.718 align:start position:0%
fishing game department so it it does
 
05:45:15.990 --> 05:45:16.000 align:start position:0%
happen uh you know I know the law
 
05:45:18.910 --> 05:45:18.920 align:start position:0%
enforcement division certainly seeks to
 
05:45:21.030 --> 05:45:21.040 align:start position:0%
find out about the illegal importation
 
05:45:25.590 --> 05:45:25.600 align:start position:0%
of pets in non-domestic animals and uh
 
05:45:27.150 --> 05:45:27.160 align:start position:0%
take appropriate
 
05:45:30.030 --> 05:45:30.040 align:start position:0%
action any other questions questions
 
05:45:32.310 --> 05:45:32.320 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you Mr ORF thank you
 
05:45:34.628 --> 05:45:34.638 align:start position:0%
and I call uh commissioner Sean Jasper
 
05:45:48.430 --> 05:45:48.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:50.830 --> 05:45:50.840 align:start position:0%
concerns thank you madam chairman me
 
05:45:51.910 --> 05:45:51.920 align:start position:0%
members of the
 
05:45:54.750 --> 05:45:54.760 align:start position:0%
committee uh I do have concerns with
 
05:45:56.910 --> 05:45:56.920 align:start position:0%
this bill and I have to say while this
 
05:45:59.430 --> 05:45:59.440 align:start position:0%
is a policy matter for you that I would
 
05:46:02.548 --> 05:46:02.558 align:start position:0%
say that passing this bill as written
 
05:46:04.150 --> 05:46:04.160 align:start position:0%
would be
 
05:46:04.160 --> 05:46:06.190 align:start position:0%
would be
irresponsible

05:46:06.190 --> 05:46:06.200 align:start position:0%
irresponsible
 
05:46:09.310 --> 05:46:09.320 align:start position:0%
um let me start off with where does this
 
05:46:12.390 --> 05:46:12.400 align:start position:0%
intersect with the Department of of
 
05:46:14.468 --> 05:46:14.478 align:start position:0%
Agriculture uh with
 
05:46:14.478 --> 05:46:16.030 align:start position:0%
Agriculture uh with
436

05:46:16.030 --> 05:46:16.040 align:start position:0%
436
 
05:46:20.628 --> 05:46:20.638 align:start position:0%
U colon one domestic animal means all
 
05:46:25.270 --> 05:46:25.280 align:start position:0%
animals um that are kept as household
 
05:46:27.548 --> 05:46:27.558 align:start position:0%
pets and that's essentially what you're
 
05:46:29.468 --> 05:46:29.478 align:start position:0%
allowing here
 
05:46:32.750 --> 05:46:32.760 align:start position:0%
yet the bill doesn't make them domestic
 
05:46:35.190 --> 05:46:35.200 align:start position:0%
animals because that would bring in a
 
05:46:38.150 --> 05:46:38.160 align:start position:0%
whole lot of other things what it does
 
05:46:40.230 --> 05:46:40.240 align:start position:0%
and I'm not sure if this was intentional
 
05:46:42.350 --> 05:46:42.360 align:start position:0%
or not but it's a great concern should
 
05:46:44.830 --> 05:46:44.840 align:start position:0%
be a great concern to all of you it
 
05:46:48.990 --> 05:46:49.000 align:start position:0%
makes these bylaw companion
 
05:46:53.110 --> 05:46:53.120 align:start position:0%
animals and there's no clear definition
 
05:46:55.590 --> 05:46:55.600 align:start position:0%
of companion animals that I can find in
 
05:46:59.310 --> 05:46:59.320 align:start position:0%
statute but what it would do is make all
 
05:47:03.628 --> 05:47:03.638 align:start position:0%
of these um animals eligible in the case
 
05:47:05.910 --> 05:47:05.920 align:start position:0%
of an emergency to go with their owner
 
05:47:08.030 --> 05:47:08.040 align:start position:0%
into an emergency
 
05:47:10.430 --> 05:47:10.440 align:start position:0%
shelter may remember some of you that
 
05:47:13.510 --> 05:47:13.520 align:start position:0%
that was just recently passed allowing
 
05:47:16.430 --> 05:47:16.440 align:start position:0%
companion animals to go into shelters
 
05:47:19.230 --> 05:47:19.240 align:start position:0%
now these you would be making companion
 
05:47:23.830 --> 05:47:23.840 align:start position:0%
animals also of perhaps even more
 
05:47:28.590 --> 05:47:28.600 align:start position:0%
concerned would be that in statute 161
 
05:47:31.350 --> 05:47:31.360 align:start position:0%
uh uh F colon
 
05:47:35.310 --> 05:47:35.320 align:start position:0%
31 elderly housing people in elderly
 
05:47:39.390 --> 05:47:39.400 align:start position:0%
housing can if 10 or more petition there
 
05:47:43.350 --> 05:47:43.360 align:start position:0%
can be a vote for 50% or more to allow
 
05:47:46.190 --> 05:47:46.200 align:start position:0%
that housing unit to have companion
 
05:47:48.670 --> 05:47:48.680 align:start position:0%
animals in it and I would suggest that
 
05:47:51.150 --> 05:47:51.160 align:start position:0%
people would probably do that not
 
05:47:54.150 --> 05:47:54.160 align:start position:0%
thinking of monkeys raccoons foxes
 
05:47:57.070 --> 05:47:57.080 align:start position:0%
zoders skunks and
 
05:47:59.190 --> 05:47:59.200 align:start position:0%
Kangaroos and so
 
05:48:00.628 --> 05:48:00.638 align:start position:0%
they could vote people thinking oh you
 
05:48:01.948 --> 05:48:01.958 align:start position:0%
know you're going to have a companion
 
05:48:04.070 --> 05:48:04.080 align:start position:0%
animal as we traditionally think of it
 
05:48:06.670 --> 05:48:06.680 align:start position:0%
and suddenly here's what comes in and
 
05:48:08.708 --> 05:48:08.718 align:start position:0%
yes there are probably ways to deal with
 
05:48:12.110 --> 05:48:12.120 align:start position:0%
that but think of how disruptive to the
 
05:48:14.030 --> 05:48:14.040 align:start position:0%
lives of those elderly people that could
 
05:48:16.868 --> 05:48:16.878 align:start position:0%
be during that
 
05:48:16.878 --> 05:48:18.590 align:start position:0%
be during that
process

05:48:18.590 --> 05:48:18.600 align:start position:0%
process
 
05:48:21.910 --> 05:48:21.920 align:start position:0%
um companion animals are are mentioned
 
05:48:24.670 --> 05:48:24.680 align:start position:0%
in the population control statute
 
05:48:29.788 --> 05:48:29.798 align:start position:0%
437a one um not clear what that means
 
05:48:32.708 --> 05:48:32.718 align:start position:0%
because we spec specifically speaks
 
05:48:36.190 --> 05:48:36.200 align:start position:0%
speak to dogs and cats but somebody uh
 
05:48:38.350 --> 05:48:38.360 align:start position:0%
would should look at
 
05:48:43.310 --> 05:48:43.320 align:start position:0%
that um troubling too is that what towns
 
05:48:45.830 --> 05:48:45.840 align:start position:0%
are what bylaws towns are allowed to
 
05:48:51.628 --> 05:48:51.638 align:start position:0%
make under 31 uh colon 39 a town May
 
05:48:54.590 --> 05:48:54.600 align:start position:0%
regulate domestic animals you have to
 
05:48:56.788 --> 05:48:56.798 align:start position:0%
have a dog on a leash you have certain
 
05:48:59.628 --> 05:48:59.638 align:start position:0%
things by doing this
 
05:49:02.390 --> 05:49:02.400 align:start position:0%
not calling them domestic animals towns
 
05:49:03.868 --> 05:49:03.878 align:start position:0%
couldn't regulate it you could take your
 
05:49:06.230 --> 05:49:06.240 align:start position:0%
kangaroo out for a walk and wouldn't
 
05:49:07.990 --> 05:49:08.000 align:start position:0%
have to be on a leash and nothing you
 
05:49:09.190 --> 05:49:09.200 align:start position:0%
could do about
 
05:49:13.390 --> 05:49:13.400 align:start position:0%
it um for me as commissioner uh one of
 
05:49:15.430 --> 05:49:15.440 align:start position:0%
the more concerning things is the issue
 
05:49:17.750 --> 05:49:17.760 align:start position:0%
which has been brought up and that's of
 
05:49:17.760 --> 05:49:18.548 align:start position:0%
which has been brought up and that's of
of

05:49:18.548 --> 05:49:18.558 align:start position:0%
of
 
05:49:21.990 --> 05:49:22.000 align:start position:0%
rabies um that if these are going to
 
05:49:25.390 --> 05:49:25.400 align:start position:0%
be TR domesticated animals in fact
 
05:49:27.350 --> 05:49:27.360 align:start position:0%
without using that term but they
 
05:49:29.230 --> 05:49:29.240 align:start position:0%
wouldn't then have to have rabies shots
 
05:49:33.110 --> 05:49:33.120 align:start position:0%
and I think we all know how uh prevalent
 
05:49:36.110 --> 05:49:36.120 align:start position:0%
rabies is in raccoons foxes and skunks
 
05:49:37.990 --> 05:49:38.000 align:start position:0%
in the state of New Hampshire what this
 
05:49:41.590 --> 05:49:41.600 align:start position:0%
bill allows to do is people could go out
 
05:49:45.670 --> 05:49:45.680 align:start position:0%
um it would appear to me and just pick
 
05:49:48.230 --> 05:49:48.240 align:start position:0%
one up out of the wild and bring it home
 
05:49:50.468 --> 05:49:50.478 align:start position:0%
more troubling is often that people see
 
05:49:52.868 --> 05:49:52.878 align:start position:0%
a sick animal and want to bring it home
 
05:49:55.708 --> 05:49:55.718 align:start position:0%
to care for it not realizing in fact
 
05:49:58.628 --> 05:49:58.638 align:start position:0%
that animal may be dying from rabies or
 
05:50:03.468 --> 05:50:03.478 align:start position:0%

offender registry and here to introduce
 
05:58:26.310 --> 05:58:26.320 align:start position:0%
the bill is representative PRM O'Brien
 
05:58:32.910 --> 05:58:32.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:36.350 --> 05:58:36.360 align:start position:0%
good afternoon it's been quite a day I I
 
05:58:39.788 --> 05:58:39.798 align:start position:0%
have another hearing committee that I'm
 
05:58:42.868 --> 05:58:42.878 align:start position:0%
in and they're exing and I'm so I'm I'm
 
05:58:45.350 --> 05:58:45.360 align:start position:0%
trying to get over there as well um you
 
05:58:47.030 --> 05:58:47.040 align:start position:0%
you can't get a replacement when you're
 
05:58:49.110 --> 05:58:49.120 align:start position:0%
in the building that's right yeah so
 
05:58:54.510 --> 05:58:54.520 align:start position:0%
it's been a day okay uh so this
 
05:58:57.310 --> 05:58:57.320 align:start position:0%
bill came to my attention by my daughter
 
05:58:59.948 --> 05:58:59.958 align:start position:0%
who is an animal control officer in
 
05:59:03.788 --> 05:59:03.798 align:start position:0%
Salem and I thought about it for for a
 
05:59:05.910 --> 05:59:05.920 align:start position:0%
number of months thinking about whether
 
05:59:07.030 --> 05:59:07.040 align:start position:0%
or not it was
 
05:59:09.670 --> 05:59:09.680 align:start position:0%
necessary and I I decided that it was so
 
05:59:11.708 --> 05:59:11.718 align:start position:0%
that's why I filed this
 
05:59:17.590 --> 05:59:17.600 align:start position:0%
legislation um animal abuse is
 
05:59:22.390 --> 05:59:22.400 align:start position:0%
currently hard to um hard to punishment
 
05:59:25.310 --> 05:59:25.320 align:start position:0%
is difficult I and I think that the the
 
05:59:27.590 --> 05:59:27.600 align:start position:0%
speakers coming after me will explain
 
05:59:30.590 --> 05:59:30.600 align:start position:0%
explain that some more
 
05:59:34.230 --> 05:59:34.240 align:start position:0%
um and it one thing that really stood
 
05:59:36.150 --> 05:59:36.160 align:start position:0%
out to me is how much of a precursor it
 
05:59:37.590 --> 05:59:37.600 align:start position:0%
is to human
 
05:59:41.590 --> 05:59:41.600 align:start position:0%
abuse I was um interviewed at one point
 
05:59:45.670 --> 05:59:45.680 align:start position:0%
in my life on a murder case uh
 
05:59:47.708 --> 05:59:47.718 align:start position:0%
and one of the things that the
 
05:59:50.830 --> 05:59:50.840 align:start position:0%
detectives asked me was about animal
 
05:59:50.840 --> 05:59:53.430 align:start position:0%
detectives asked me was about animal
abuse

05:59:53.430 --> 05:59:53.440 align:start position:0%
abuse
 
05:59:56.548 --> 05:59:56.558 align:start position:0%
and it wasn't really exactly connected
 
05:59:58.788 --> 05:59:58.798 align:start position:0%
to the case but it definitely was a part
 
06:00:00.628 --> 06:00:00.638 align:start position:0%
of this person's character and it was
 
06:00:01.628 --> 06:00:01.638 align:start position:0%
something I
 
06:00:01.638 --> 06:00:03.350 align:start position:0%
something I
witnessed

06:00:03.350 --> 06:00:03.360 align:start position:0%
witnessed
 
06:00:05.430 --> 06:00:05.440 align:start position:0%
and that's not the only time I've
 
06:00:09.788 --> 06:00:09.798 align:start position:0%
experience something like that I also um
 
06:00:12.708 --> 06:00:12.718 align:start position:0%
I also spoke to uh a lot of uh sex
 
06:00:14.310 --> 06:00:14.320 align:start position:0%
offenders convicted sex offenders in
 
06:00:16.468 --> 06:00:16.478 align:start position:0%
this state with a program that I was
 
06:00:18.830 --> 06:00:18.840 align:start position:0%
with where
 
06:00:21.990 --> 06:00:22.000 align:start position:0%
um sex abuse survivors would speak to um
 
06:00:24.110 --> 06:00:24.120 align:start position:0%
convicted sex offenders and this was
 
06:00:26.670 --> 06:00:26.680 align:start position:0%
often part of that I know it's not
 
06:00:28.830 --> 06:00:28.840 align:start position:0%
comfortable to think about about
 
06:00:28.840 --> 06:00:32.150 align:start position:0%
comfortable to think about about
but

06:00:32.150 --> 06:00:32.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:34.590 --> 06:00:34.600 align:start position:0%
um I don't really want to be overly
 
06:00:36.788 --> 06:00:36.798 align:start position:0%
punitive and I know all of you probably
 
06:00:39.430 --> 06:00:39.440 align:start position:0%
feel the same way I I really am careful
 
06:00:41.708 --> 06:00:41.718 align:start position:0%
about that these people would not be on
 
06:00:43.230 --> 06:00:43.240 align:start position:0%
the list for the rest of their lives
 
06:00:45.030 --> 06:00:45.040 align:start position:0%
they'd only be on the list for a short
 
06:00:46.788 --> 06:00:46.798 align:start position:0%
period of time if convicted for these
 
06:00:52.270 --> 06:00:52.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:55.230 --> 06:00:55.240 align:start position:0%
6448 and it would be it would be a shock
 
06:00:56.868 --> 06:00:56.878 align:start position:0%
I know that it would be a shock to them
 
06:00:58.390 --> 06:00:58.400 align:start position:0%
and to the people that know them but it
 
06:01:00.350 --> 06:01:00.360 align:start position:0%
would be an opportunity to address the
 
06:01:02.310 --> 06:01:02.320 align:start position:0%
problem before it gets worse or before
 
06:01:07.270 --> 06:01:07.280 align:start position:0%
it merely continues on um and so that
 
06:01:10.670 --> 06:01:10.680 align:start position:0%
was a that was a big uh reason for why I
 
06:01:12.468 --> 06:01:12.478 align:start position:0%
decided to to go ahead and file this
 
06:01:15.270 --> 06:01:15.280 align:start position:0%
legislation it's it's something that's
 
06:01:17.708 --> 06:01:17.718 align:start position:0%
modeled after what is being used in uh
 
06:01:19.670 --> 06:01:19.680 align:start position:0%
Tennessee right now and I spoke to some
 
06:01:22.190 --> 06:01:22.200 align:start position:0%
legislators in Tennessee about this
 
06:01:23.670 --> 06:01:23.680 align:start position:0%
there aren't a lot of people on these
 
06:01:27.110 --> 06:01:27.120 align:start position:0%
lists it's it's not I didn't consider it
 
06:01:29.468 --> 06:01:29.478 align:start position:0%
to be too much work for our uh
 
06:01:31.708 --> 06:01:31.718 align:start position:0%
Department of Safety to maintain they
 
06:01:34.230 --> 06:01:34.240 align:start position:0%
already do this for the sex offender
 
06:01:37.070 --> 06:01:37.080 align:start position:0%
lists that people in our in our state
 
06:01:39.468 --> 06:01:39.478 align:start position:0%
use all the time to um find out more
 
06:01:42.350 --> 06:01:42.360 align:start position:0%
about how to keep their own families
 
06:01:44.270 --> 06:01:44.280 align:start position:0%
safe and their you know their children
 
06:01:46.670 --> 06:01:46.680 align:start position:0%
in their
 
06:01:49.110 --> 06:01:49.120 align:start position:0%
care there there may even be times when
 
06:01:50.868 --> 06:01:50.878 align:start position:0%
there's nobody on the list I can I I can
 
06:01:52.750 --> 06:01:52.760 align:start position:0%
foresee that happening I I foresee that
 
06:01:55.670 --> 06:01:55.680 align:start position:0%
this will be a small amount of people um
 
06:01:56.868 --> 06:01:56.878 align:start position:0%
but it's a tool and I think it's a
 
06:01:57.990 --> 06:01:58.000 align:start position:0%
needed tool
 
06:02:01.310 --> 06:02:01.320 align:start position:0%
so with that any questions I will try to
 
06:02:04.628 --> 06:02:04.638 align:start position:0%
answer as best I can representative
 
06:02:07.510 --> 06:02:07.520 align:start position:0%
Howard if um the oh thank you madam
 
06:02:10.310 --> 06:02:10.320 align:start position:0%
chair and um I was just wondering if if
 
06:02:13.590 --> 06:02:13.600 align:start position:0%
the progression from abusing animals to
 
06:02:15.750 --> 06:02:15.760 align:start position:0%
murder of a human being is um
 
06:02:17.910 --> 06:02:17.920 align:start position:0%
Progressive why would you keep these
 
06:02:20.030 --> 06:02:20.040 align:start position:0%
people on for a short
 
06:02:23.230 --> 06:02:23.240 align:start position:0%
time thank you that's a good
 
06:02:25.670 --> 06:02:25.680 align:start position:0%
question there really isn't a lot of
 
06:02:28.150 --> 06:02:28.160 align:start position:0%
interest in keeping people on for a very
 
06:02:31.468 --> 06:02:31.478 align:start position:0%
long time just the fact that if this
 
06:02:34.750 --> 06:02:34.760 align:start position:0%
were to pass and this were to um be
 
06:02:38.110 --> 06:02:38.120 align:start position:0%
established as as as is in this bill
 
06:02:39.708 --> 06:02:39.718 align:start position:0%
that to be honest with you I think that
 
06:02:42.750 --> 06:02:42.760 align:start position:0%
would be that would be amazing um
 
06:02:45.788 --> 06:02:45.798 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of resistance to it some
 
06:02:47.548 --> 06:02:47.558 align:start position:0%
people find it to be too punitive it's
 
06:02:49.150 --> 06:02:49.160 align:start position:0%
you know they maybe they think it's just
 
06:02:52.150 --> 06:02:52.160 align:start position:0%
animals okay
 
06:02:56.150 --> 06:02:56.160 align:start position:0%
well Jeff dmer started with Just Animals
 
06:02:58.708 --> 06:02:58.718 align:start position:0%
I'm sure you I've heard some of
 
06:03:02.070 --> 06:03:02.080 align:start position:0%
that representative NAB yeah thank you
 
06:03:03.788 --> 06:03:03.798 align:start position:0%
madam chair um thank you for being here
 
06:03:06.070 --> 06:03:06.080 align:start position:0%
and you don't have much time um what do
 
06:03:08.390 --> 06:03:08.400 align:start position:0%
you see the purpose of this registry
 
06:03:09.868 --> 06:03:09.878 align:start position:0%
what do you see it serving I mean do you
 
06:03:12.150 --> 06:03:12.160 align:start position:0%
see it as like a shelter breeder
 
06:03:13.990 --> 06:03:14.000 align:start position:0%
wouldn't adopt to what such a person do
 
06:03:15.750 --> 06:03:15.760 align:start position:0%
you see it as like what do you see as
 
06:03:18.150 --> 06:03:18.160 align:start position:0%
the end goal of having this well it
 
06:03:20.628 --> 06:03:20.638 align:start position:0%
could it could stop the abuse of animals
 
06:03:23.708 --> 06:03:23.718 align:start position:0%
by alerting people in the community that
 
06:03:26.628 --> 06:03:26.638 align:start position:0%
do adopt out animals or sell animals
 
06:03:29.230 --> 06:03:29.240 align:start position:0%
they would know know that these people
 
06:03:33.548 --> 06:03:33.558 align:start position:0%
have that problem and that would solve
 
06:03:35.948 --> 06:03:35.958 align:start position:0%
that issue where in one Community they
 
06:03:39.830 --> 06:03:39.840 align:start position:0%
may be um they may be have found to have
 
06:03:41.750 --> 06:03:41.760 align:start position:0%
abused animals but that information
 
06:03:43.468 --> 06:03:43.478 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be getting to another community
 
06:03:45.270 --> 06:03:45.280 align:start position:0%
in our state that would be hard to
 
06:03:47.670 --> 06:03:47.680 align:start position:0%
communicate would be very difficult for
 
06:03:49.270 --> 06:03:49.280 align:start position:0%
say the southern part of the state the
 
06:03:50.628 --> 06:03:50.638 align:start position:0%
nor the northern part of the state the
 
06:03:52.510 --> 06:03:52.520 align:start position:0%
Sea Coast the western part of the state
 
06:03:52.520 --> 06:03:53.628 align:start position:0%
Sea Coast the western part of the state
Sullivan

06:03:53.628 --> 06:03:53.638 align:start position:0%
Sullivan
 
06:03:58.110 --> 06:03:58.120 align:start position:0%
County this would help that tremendously
 
06:03:58.120 --> 06:03:59.628 align:start position:0%
County this would help that tremendously
representative

06:03:59.628 --> 06:03:59.638 align:start position:0%
representative
 
06:04:01.830 --> 06:04:01.840 align:start position:0%
ktoa thank you madam chairman thank you
 
06:04:03.910 --> 06:04:03.920 align:start position:0%
for taking my
 
06:04:07.708 --> 06:04:07.718 align:start position:0%
question I appreciate the intent of this
 
06:04:09.468 --> 06:04:09.478 align:start position:0%
however uh in
 
06:04:12.150 --> 06:04:12.160 align:start position:0%
our over several years what we have
 
06:04:16.350 --> 06:04:16.360 align:start position:0%
learned uh is that a majority of animal
 
06:04:20.468 --> 06:04:20.478 align:start position:0%
abusers have mental health uh illnesses
 
06:04:23.948 --> 06:04:23.958 align:start position:0%
and I am not sure that putting them on a
 
06:04:26.230 --> 06:04:26.240 align:start position:0%
registry would be in the best interest
 
06:04:28.030 --> 06:04:28.040 align:start position:0%
of their Mental Health
 
06:04:31.390 --> 06:04:31.400 align:start position:0%
and also uh in current Statute in our
 
06:04:35.390 --> 06:04:35.400 align:start position:0%
animal cruelty laws if you are
 
06:04:37.948 --> 06:04:37.958 align:start position:0%
convicted of animal abuse you cannot own
 
06:04:40.390 --> 06:04:40.400 align:start position:0%
an animal for 5
 
06:04:44.468 --> 06:04:44.478 align:start position:0%
years so I are you aware of that well
 
06:04:46.548 --> 06:04:46.558 align:start position:0%
thank you for telling me more of the
 
06:04:49.990 --> 06:04:50.000 align:start position:0%
Nuance of of that I appreciate that I
 
06:04:53.030 --> 06:04:53.040 align:start position:0%
think this would not
 
06:04:55.788 --> 06:04:55.798 align:start position:0%
be I think that this would be fine this
 
06:04:57.510 --> 06:04:57.520 align:start position:0%
would be ACC comp that would this would
 
06:05:01.990 --> 06:05:02.000 align:start position:0%
be complimentary to those same efforts
 
06:05:04.910 --> 06:05:04.920 align:start position:0%
uh and I I I would like to go back and
 
06:05:07.030 --> 06:05:07.040 align:start position:0%
and I know that many of the people may
 
06:05:08.548 --> 06:05:08.558 align:start position:0%
have some mental health issues and
 
06:05:10.548 --> 06:05:10.558 align:start position:0%
that's unfortunate and I of course don't
 
06:05:12.310 --> 06:05:12.320 align:start position:0%
want to make those worse but you could
 
06:05:14.788 --> 06:05:14.798 align:start position:0%
absolutely make that that argument about
 
06:05:17.310 --> 06:05:17.320 align:start position:0%
sex offenders and and I'm sure it was
 
06:05:20.430 --> 06:05:20.440 align:start position:0%
when before that that uh registry was
 
06:05:22.390 --> 06:05:22.400 align:start position:0%
created a lot of people didn't want to
 
06:05:24.910 --> 06:05:24.920 align:start position:0%
make things worse for them well there
 
06:05:28.350 --> 06:05:28.360 align:start position:0%
are innocent creatures who have no voice
 
06:05:32.030 --> 06:05:32.040 align:start position:0%
here just as children had no voice when
 
06:05:33.990 --> 06:05:34.000 align:start position:0%
you know the sex offender registry was
 
06:05:35.708 --> 06:05:35.718 align:start position:0%
was created they didn't have a voice
 
06:05:38.310 --> 06:05:38.320 align:start position:0%
that helped to give them
 
06:05:41.708 --> 06:05:41.718 align:start position:0%
one any other questions from the
 
06:05:44.350 --> 06:05:44.360 align:start position:0%
committee represent Murray thank you
 
06:05:45.788 --> 06:05:45.798 align:start position:0%
madam chair and thank you for taking my
 
06:05:47.948 --> 06:05:47.958 align:start position:0%
question I did have a question sort of
 
06:05:47.958 --> 06:05:49.590 align:start position:0%
question I did have a question sort of
around

06:05:49.590 --> 06:05:49.600 align:start position:0%
around
 
06:05:53.230 --> 06:05:53.240 align:start position:0%
um levels of offense and I don't see
 
06:05:55.270 --> 06:05:55.280 align:start position:0%
anything enumerated in here that would
 
06:05:57.670 --> 06:05:57.680 align:start position:0%
talk about it's just an offense as an
 
06:05:59.430 --> 06:05:59.440 align:start position:0%
offense regardless of whether it's one
 
06:06:01.788 --> 06:06:01.798 align:start position:0%
animal multiple animals types
 
06:06:05.430 --> 06:06:05.440 align:start position:0%
of harm against an animal so we just
 
06:06:08.788 --> 06:06:08.798 align:start position:0%
curious if that is something you
 
06:06:12.110 --> 06:06:12.120 align:start position:0%
had it yes and I have and it would be as
 
06:06:13.788 --> 06:06:13.798 align:start position:0%
it applies to
 
06:06:18.708 --> 06:06:18.718 align:start position:0%
6448 and that definition
 
06:06:21.468 --> 06:06:21.478 align:start position:0%
um I'm not the best person in the whole
 
06:06:23.150 --> 06:06:23.160 align:start position:0%
wide world you know I'm not a bad person
 
06:06:26.150 --> 06:06:26.160 align:start position:0%
of I think of myself but I think I have
 
06:06:29.628 --> 06:06:29.638 align:start position:0%
to do a lot to to get on this list um
 
06:06:31.270 --> 06:06:31.280 align:start position:0%
there are some days I'm I'm a little
 
06:06:34.390 --> 06:06:34.400 align:start position:0%
late feeding the dog that kind of thing
 
06:06:36.990 --> 06:06:37.000 align:start position:0%
um but you have to do things to get on
 
06:06:40.110 --> 06:06:40.120 align:start position:0%
this list I you have to do some negative
 
06:06:42.270 --> 06:06:42.280 align:start position:0%
things okay so I don't think that
 
06:06:44.390 --> 06:06:44.400 align:start position:0%
innocent people will completely innocent
 
06:06:46.948 --> 06:06:46.958 align:start position:0%
people who are just you know forgetting
 
06:06:48.708 --> 06:06:48.718 align:start position:0%
to feed their dog a little bit I don't
 
06:06:49.830 --> 06:06:49.840 align:start position:0%
think those people are going to get
 
06:06:52.830 --> 06:06:52.840 align:start position:0%
caught up in this and and from what I
 
06:06:55.948 --> 06:06:55.958 align:start position:0%
hear from law enforcement is that
 
06:06:59.030 --> 06:06:59.040 align:start position:0%
education is is the first thing they try
 
06:07:01.830 --> 06:07:01.840 align:start position:0%
to do and it takes a lot before they
 
06:07:06.430 --> 06:07:06.440 align:start position:0%
they press charges um I see there's
 
06:07:09.270 --> 06:07:09.280 align:start position:0%
another question so yeah represent Bixby
 
06:07:13.110 --> 06:07:13.120 align:start position:0%
yeah so um just so you're aware in uh
 
06:07:16.868 --> 06:07:16.878 align:start position:0%
6448 there are two different categories
 
06:07:19.070 --> 06:07:19.080 align:start position:0%
of animal abuse uh there are there's
 
06:07:21.468 --> 06:07:21.478 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor abuse which is
 
06:07:25.390 --> 06:07:25.400 align:start position:0%
primarily uh a results from
 
06:07:28.548 --> 06:07:28.558 align:start position:0%
negligence and that can that's one which
 
06:07:32.670 --> 06:07:32.680 align:start position:0%
is often uh stemming from mental illness
 
06:07:35.030 --> 06:07:35.040 align:start position:0%
someone thinks they're doing a lot of
 
06:07:37.230 --> 06:07:37.240 align:start position:0%
thinks they're rescuing animals but
 
06:07:38.750 --> 06:07:38.760 align:start position:0%
they're bringing into bringing them into
 
06:07:40.230 --> 06:07:40.240 align:start position:0%
a situation where they can't take care
 
06:07:45.190 --> 06:07:45.200 align:start position:0%
of them yeah the other level is the um
 
06:07:49.750 --> 06:07:49.760 align:start position:0%
is uh felony abuse which is purposive
 
06:07:53.990 --> 06:07:54.000 align:start position:0%
and intended to be cruel uh and uh
 
06:07:55.468 --> 06:07:55.478 align:start position:0%
without this bill making a
 
06:07:57.390 --> 06:07:57.400 align:start position:0%
differentiation between them I think
 
06:08:00.510 --> 06:08:00.520 align:start position:0%
there that that's opening up um a a
 
06:08:02.788 --> 06:08:02.798 align:start position:0%
significant area of problems the other
 
06:08:04.310 --> 06:08:04.320 align:start position:0%
thing is that the
 
06:08:07.230 --> 06:08:07.240 align:start position:0%
negligence uh category is by far the
 
06:08:09.750 --> 06:08:09.760 align:start position:0%
most dominant in terms of what people
 
06:08:13.390 --> 06:08:13.400 align:start position:0%
are found to be doing thank you for that
 
06:08:16.030 --> 06:08:16.040 align:start position:0%
question negligence is a is a problem
 
06:08:18.830 --> 06:08:18.840 align:start position:0%
and you can you can think that that
 
06:08:21.708 --> 06:08:21.718 align:start position:0%
there's less intent to int to to hurt
 
06:08:23.830 --> 06:08:23.840 align:start position:0%
the less active intent to hurt the
 
06:08:25.750 --> 06:08:25.760 align:start position:0%
animal you could say the same thing
 
06:08:27.230 --> 06:08:27.240 align:start position:0%
about neglect of children children
 
06:08:29.948 --> 06:08:29.958 align:start position:0%
there's less active intent to hurt
 
06:08:32.910 --> 06:08:32.920 align:start position:0%
children but they still get taken from
 
06:08:35.708 --> 06:08:35.718 align:start position:0%
their home for those reasons they still
 
06:08:37.910 --> 06:08:37.920 align:start position:0%
go hungry for those reasons they still
 
06:08:39.590 --> 06:08:39.600 align:start position:0%
don't have a safe place to sleep for
 
06:08:42.868 --> 06:08:42.878 align:start position:0%
those reasons so animals are in the same
 
06:08:44.830 --> 06:08:44.840 align:start position:0%
category and and it is unfortunate that
 
06:08:46.788 --> 06:08:46.798 align:start position:0%
when it's someone who's not actively
 
06:08:48.670 --> 06:08:48.680 align:start position:0%
trying to harm the
 
06:08:52.070 --> 06:08:52.080 align:start position:0%
animal they get caught up in this but if
 
06:08:55.030 --> 06:08:55.040 align:start position:0%
it does help keep that person
 
06:08:57.830 --> 06:08:57.840 align:start position:0%
from from collecting more animals that
 
06:09:00.350 --> 06:09:00.360 align:start position:0%
they can't reasonably care for this is
 
06:09:02.390 --> 06:09:02.400 align:start position:0%
good for the animals I'm I I think it's
 
06:09:03.948 --> 06:09:03.958 align:start position:0%
unfortunate yes that these people would
 
06:09:06.628 --> 06:09:06.638 align:start position:0%
be on that registry but it does help to
 
06:09:08.468 --> 06:09:08.478 align:start position:0%
educate other people that that give
 
06:09:11.310 --> 06:09:11.320 align:start position:0%
animals that that adopt out animals or
 
06:09:14.590 --> 06:09:14.600 align:start position:0%
sell animals they would they would be
 
06:09:16.670 --> 06:09:16.680 align:start position:0%
given a tool that would help to inform
 
06:09:19.910 --> 06:09:19.920 align:start position:0%
them of how they can keep such cases
 
06:09:22.150 --> 06:09:22.160 align:start position:0%
from from uh continuing and I think what
 
06:09:23.548 --> 06:09:23.558 align:start position:0%
you're specifically talking about might
 
06:09:26.430 --> 06:09:26.440 align:start position:0%
be Animal Hoarding and that is a problem
 
06:09:26.440 --> 06:09:27.708 align:start position:0%
be Animal Hoarding and that is a problem
and

06:09:27.708 --> 06:09:27.718 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:09:29.548 --> 06:09:29.558 align:start position:0%
um it's a very difficult problem to
 
06:09:31.070 --> 06:09:31.080 align:start position:0%
address I've had to address it with
 
06:09:33.910 --> 06:09:33.920 align:start position:0%
someone um that I knew and it was very
 
06:09:35.788 --> 06:09:35.798 align:start position:0%
difficult to get that help it was the
 
06:09:37.310 --> 06:09:37.320 align:start position:0%
most miserable thing I think I've ever
 
06:09:39.390 --> 06:09:39.400 align:start position:0%
experienced in my life having to try to
 
06:09:40.750 --> 06:09:40.760 align:start position:0%
address that and that was a different
 
06:09:44.548 --> 06:09:44.558 align:start position:0%
state but um it was really hard it was
 
06:09:48.590 --> 06:09:48.600 align:start position:0%
really hard represent Duty uh thank you
 
06:09:52.350 --> 06:09:52.360 align:start position:0%
madam chair I'm curious um the cruelty
 
06:09:54.190 --> 06:09:54.200 align:start position:0%
statutes come under the Department of
 
06:09:57.350 --> 06:09:57.360 align:start position:0%
Agriculture so why is the uh Department
 
06:10:00.150 --> 06:10:00.160 align:start position:0%
of Safety listed uh twice in here as
 
06:10:02.230 --> 06:10:02.240 align:start position:0%
having responsibility is there thank you
 
06:10:04.510 --> 06:10:04.520 align:start position:0%
something I'm not aware of yes thank you
 
06:10:07.030 --> 06:10:07.040 align:start position:0%
that's a good question because it's
 
06:10:09.468 --> 06:10:09.478 align:start position:0%
modeled after the sex offender registry
 
06:10:12.430 --> 06:10:12.440 align:start position:0%
and since there's already that program
 
06:10:16.190 --> 06:10:16.200 align:start position:0%
in place it was not difficult for
 
06:10:18.670 --> 06:10:18.680 align:start position:0%
Tennessee to do it in that same manner
 
06:10:20.788 --> 06:10:20.798 align:start position:0%
and it's just a small amount of
 
06:10:23.468 --> 06:10:23.478 align:start position:0%
redundancy of what they already do so I
 
06:10:25.510 --> 06:10:25.520 align:start position:0%
I was just thinking that would be the
 
06:10:26.910 --> 06:10:26.920 align:start position:0%
easiest way to go about it just as
 
06:10:26.920 --> 06:10:31.468 align:start position:0%
easiest way to go about it just as
Tennessee

06:10:31.468 --> 06:10:31.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:10:35.628 --> 06:10:35.638 align:start position:0%
did okay I'm I'm still I'm still unsure
 
06:10:39.830 --> 06:10:39.840 align:start position:0%
about why you believe we need a registry
 
06:10:41.948 --> 06:10:41.958 align:start position:0%
at all I mean what's the purpose for
 
06:10:44.110 --> 06:10:44.120 align:start position:0%
having this list let me go back to is
 
06:10:46.548 --> 06:10:46.558 align:start position:0%
this so that people won't employ them is
 
06:10:51.230 --> 06:10:51.240 align:start position:0%
it so people will um stay away from them
 
06:10:54.270 --> 06:10:54.280 align:start position:0%
it's it I mean I I just I don't
 
06:10:55.990 --> 06:10:56.000 align:start position:0%
understand what this list would be for
 
06:10:57.230 --> 06:10:57.240 align:start position:0%
well you could say the same thing about
 
06:10:59.070 --> 06:10:59.080 align:start position:0%
the sex ofender registry and I was
 
06:11:01.390 --> 06:11:01.400 align:start position:0%
running um a certain kind of business
 
06:11:02.868 --> 06:11:02.878 align:start position:0%
where it didn't really matter all that
 
06:11:04.468 --> 06:11:04.478 align:start position:0%
much of a person you know there were no
 
06:11:06.230 --> 06:11:06.240 align:start position:0%
children there maybe
 
06:11:09.990 --> 06:11:10.000 align:start position:0%
a um manufacturing facility or something
 
06:11:11.990 --> 06:11:12.000 align:start position:0%
like that no children no problem with
 
06:11:15.110 --> 06:11:15.120 align:start position:0%
them ever interacting with
 
06:11:17.590 --> 06:11:17.600 align:start position:0%
children then employing them wouldn't be
 
06:11:20.750 --> 06:11:20.760 align:start position:0%
an issue here would this keep them from
 
06:11:22.788 --> 06:11:22.798 align:start position:0%
being is such people being from being
 
06:11:24.628 --> 06:11:24.638 align:start position:0%
employed maybe in the animal care
 
06:11:29.830 --> 06:11:29.840 align:start position:0%
business yes um is that a problem I hope
 
06:11:31.430 --> 06:11:31.440 align:start position:0%
that you can agree that that is not a
 
06:11:33.948 --> 06:11:33.958 align:start position:0%
problem I think that's that's good
 
06:11:36.190 --> 06:11:36.200 align:start position:0%
judgment but if
 
06:11:40.670 --> 06:11:40.680 align:start position:0%
they were trying to uh change their ways
 
06:11:42.110 --> 06:11:42.120 align:start position:0%
and be
 
06:11:44.230 --> 06:11:44.240 align:start position:0%
rehabilitated um wouldn't we want them
 
06:11:46.190 --> 06:11:46.200 align:start position:0%
to be interacting with animals and
 
06:11:48.270 --> 06:11:48.280 align:start position:0%
learning how to do that in a healthy way
 
06:11:52.430 --> 06:11:52.440 align:start position:0%
I suppose that might be a good thing um
 
06:11:54.628 --> 06:11:54.638 align:start position:0%
it depends on your level of how much you
 
06:11:56.830 --> 06:11:56.840 align:start position:0%
believe people change how much you
 
06:11:58.468 --> 06:11:58.478 align:start position:0%
forgive them how much risk you want to
 
06:12:02.230 --> 06:12:02.240 align:start position:0%
take with Innocent creatures who
 
06:12:04.350 --> 06:12:04.360 align:start position:0%
can't defend
 
06:12:07.948 --> 06:12:07.958 align:start position:0%
themselves um I with the with the
 
06:12:09.070 --> 06:12:09.080 align:start position:0%
experience that I had the personal
 
06:12:10.430 --> 06:12:10.440 align:start position:0%
experience I had with the Animal
 
06:12:13.430 --> 06:12:13.440 align:start position:0%
Hoarding situation and trying to solve
 
06:12:13.440 --> 06:12:14.430 align:start position:0%
Hoarding situation and trying to solve
that

06:12:14.430 --> 06:12:14.440 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:12:14.440 --> 06:12:15.948 align:start position:0%
that
problem

06:12:15.948 --> 06:12:15.958 align:start position:0%
problem
 
06:12:18.868 --> 06:12:18.878 align:start position:0%
if if that person
 
06:12:21.390 --> 06:12:21.400 align:start position:0%
kept trying to adopt animals I would
 
06:12:23.350 --> 06:12:23.360 align:start position:0%
consider that to be just a continuation
 
06:12:25.150 --> 06:12:25.160 align:start position:0%
of a traumatic experience that I would
 
06:12:26.708 --> 06:12:26.718 align:start position:0%
have to continue to live over over and
 
06:12:29.390 --> 06:12:29.400 align:start position:0%
over again to just have no power in
 
06:12:31.868 --> 06:12:31.878 align:start position:0%
helping these
 
06:12:35.548 --> 06:12:35.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:12:39.750 --> 06:12:39.760 align:start position:0%
Penza so comparing um this list to a sex
 
06:12:42.590 --> 06:12:42.600 align:start position:0%
offender registry I just think is
 
06:12:44.708 --> 06:12:44.718 align:start position:0%
there's no comparison your your apples
 
06:12:47.590 --> 06:12:47.600 align:start position:0%
and oranges here so in creating a
 
06:12:50.868 --> 06:12:50.878 align:start position:0%
surveillance state for someone that
 
06:12:54.670 --> 06:12:54.680 align:start position:0%
makes a a mistake on you know with with
 
06:12:58.270 --> 06:12:58.280 align:start position:0%
a with a pet or or with caring for an
 
06:13:00.590 --> 06:13:00.600 align:start position:0%
animal is one thing this is just a
 
06:13:04.190 --> 06:13:04.200 align:start position:0%
complete slippery slope so how I don't
 
06:13:06.468 --> 06:13:06.478 align:start position:0%
understand what the I don't see where
 
06:13:08.430 --> 06:13:08.440 align:start position:0%
there is any benefit in doing this
 
06:13:10.750 --> 06:13:10.760 align:start position:0%
because people that are already felons
 
06:13:13.670 --> 06:13:13.680 align:start position:0%
that have committed heinous acts the
 
06:13:15.350 --> 06:13:15.360 align:start position:0%
Animal Control Officers and the police
 
06:13:16.590 --> 06:13:16.600 align:start position:0%
would already know about who these
 
06:13:20.270 --> 06:13:20.280 align:start position:0%
people are isn't that enough I wish that
 
06:13:22.350 --> 06:13:22.360 align:start position:0%
was enough in the situation that I
 
06:13:24.030 --> 06:13:24.040 align:start position:0%
experienced but it absolutely wasn't
 
06:13:26.628 --> 06:13:26.638 align:start position:0%
until the mother kitten was trapped and
 
06:13:28.070 --> 06:13:28.080 align:start position:0%
was eating her young because she was
 
06:13:32.310 --> 06:13:32.320 align:start position:0%
trapped and and also uh a major
 
06:13:37.230 --> 06:13:37.240 align:start position:0%
infestation of of um insects from that
 
06:13:39.910 --> 06:13:39.920 align:start position:0%
fleas and I had to deal with all of that
 
06:13:42.110 --> 06:13:42.120 align:start position:0%
I had to deal with all of that and and I
 
06:13:44.030 --> 06:13:44.040 align:start position:0%
I was
 
06:13:47.430 --> 06:13:47.440 align:start position:0%
overwhelmed um I don't want to revisit
 
06:13:50.390 --> 06:13:50.400 align:start position:0%
even thinking about this please this was
 
06:13:52.948 --> 06:13:52.958 align:start position:0%
really difficult situation for me to
 
06:13:52.958 --> 06:13:53.990 align:start position:0%
really difficult situation for me to
have

06:13:53.990 --> 06:13:54.000 align:start position:0%
have
 
06:13:58.230 --> 06:13:58.240 align:start position:0%
um to this was an elderly person and and
 
06:13:59.708 --> 06:13:59.718 align:start position:0%
I would say that the person another
 
06:14:03.270 --> 06:14:03.280 align:start position:0%
person that was in the situation was um
 
06:14:05.070 --> 06:14:05.080 align:start position:0%
very irresponsible and abusive and if
 
06:14:06.628 --> 06:14:06.638 align:start position:0%
that person never owned animals again
 
06:14:07.990 --> 06:14:08.000 align:start position:0%
that's great that's fine I have no
 
06:14:09.430 --> 06:14:09.440 align:start position:0%
problem with that I can sleep at night
 
06:14:09.440 --> 06:14:11.150 align:start position:0%
problem with that I can sleep at night
with

06:14:11.150 --> 06:14:11.160 align:start position:0%
with
 
06:14:13.430 --> 06:14:13.440 align:start position:0%
that okay any other questions from the
 
06:14:16.070 --> 06:14:16.080 align:start position:0%
committee thank you representative prom
 
06:14:19.590 --> 06:14:19.600 align:start position:0%

it

06:14:29.910 --> 06:14:29.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:14:33.270 --> 06:14:33.280 align:start position:0%

panila Bania Bia okay good afterno mno
 
06:14:39.430 --> 06:14:39.440 align:start position:0%
and committee um I represent the New
 
06:14:40.628 --> 06:14:40.638 align:start position:0%
Hampshire State Police under the
 
06:14:42.430 --> 06:14:42.440 align:start position:0%
department of safety I've been on for
 
06:14:45.788 --> 06:14:45.798 align:start position:0%
over 20 years now um we are very neutral
 
06:14:48.310 --> 06:14:48.320 align:start position:0%
in this in this matter other than we are
 
06:14:49.830 --> 06:14:49.840 align:start position:0%
looking at some of the things that are
 
06:14:51.468 --> 06:14:51.478 align:start position:0%
written in the legislation that causes
 
06:14:53.190 --> 06:14:53.200 align:start position:0%
us a little bit of concern of how it's
 
06:14:55.628 --> 06:14:55.638 align:start position:0%
written um with the booking photo coming
 
06:14:57.708 --> 06:14:57.718 align:start position:0%
in if there's no booking photo taken at
 
06:14:59.948 --> 06:14:59.958 align:start position:0%
that time of arrest whose responsibility
 
06:15:02.150 --> 06:15:02.160 align:start position:0%
is it in order to obtain that photo or
 
06:15:04.390 --> 06:15:04.400 align:start position:0%
is it going to be okay for that person
 
06:15:07.310 --> 06:15:07.320 align:start position:0%
not to be on there um I know we referen
 
06:15:08.990 --> 06:15:09.000 align:start position:0%
the sex offender registry a lot they all
 
06:15:10.590 --> 06:15:10.600 align:start position:0%
get their photos taken at the time
 
06:15:12.390 --> 06:15:12.400 align:start position:0%
they're registering to be a sex offender
 
06:15:14.270 --> 06:15:14.280 align:start position:0%
when they're coming out so it's a little
 
06:15:17.590 --> 06:15:17.600 align:start position:0%
bit different than that um it's also
 
06:15:19.430 --> 06:15:19.440 align:start position:0%
written in here that the registry shall
 
06:15:20.830 --> 06:15:20.840 align:start position:0%
remain on the department's website for
 
06:15:22.270 --> 06:15:22.280 align:start position:0%
as such time as determined by the
 
06:15:24.390 --> 06:15:24.400 align:start position:0%
commissioner that's kind of a is there a
 
06:15:25.868 --> 06:15:25.878 align:start position:0%
minimum time frame the commissioner has
 
06:15:28.190 --> 06:15:28.200 align:start position:0%
to keep keep this website up um we're
 
06:15:32.110 --> 06:15:32.120 align:start position:0%
not sure on that um and then the last
 
06:15:33.670 --> 06:15:33.680 align:start position:0%
when the individual's name is added to
 
06:15:35.350 --> 06:15:35.360 align:start position:0%
the registry the department shall notify
 
06:15:37.110 --> 06:15:37.120 align:start position:0%
them if they want to have their name
 
06:15:38.948 --> 06:15:38.958 align:start position:0%
expunged we think that's something that
 
06:15:40.628 --> 06:15:40.638 align:start position:0%
should fall on the individual not on the
 
06:15:42.468 --> 06:15:42.478 align:start position:0%
department in order to provide that
 
06:15:44.468 --> 06:15:44.478 align:start position:0%
notification um to the individual they
 
06:15:46.110 --> 06:15:46.120 align:start position:0%
should just be made aware at the time
 
06:15:47.910 --> 06:15:47.920 align:start position:0%
during the law that if they wish to have
 
06:15:49.788 --> 06:15:49.798 align:start position:0%
their name expunged and also what does
 
06:15:51.708 --> 06:15:51.718 align:start position:0%
that expungement look like we don't have
 
06:15:53.788 --> 06:15:53.798 align:start position:0%
any guidelines set up there in order to
 
06:15:55.750 --> 06:15:55.760 align:start position:0%
say if you're coming off the registry
 
06:15:57.628 --> 06:15:57.638 align:start position:0%
prior to your two years or how long
 
06:15:59.830 --> 06:15:59.840 align:start position:0%
you're on what does that look like um
 
06:16:01.390 --> 06:16:01.400 align:start position:0%
there's also going to be a cost for us
 
06:16:02.830 --> 06:16:02.840 align:start position:0%
in order to do this because we would
 
06:16:05.310 --> 06:16:05.320 align:start position:0%
have to hire somebody um we don't know
 
06:16:07.468 --> 06:16:07.478 align:start position:0%
the extent of how much this is going to
 
06:16:10.468 --> 06:16:10.478 align:start position:0%
take of time so a program assistant to
 
06:16:13.110 --> 06:16:13.120 align:start position:0%
right now would be 136,000 a year up to
 
06:16:15.350 --> 06:16:15.360 align:start position:0%
150 when you go for the next four years
 
06:16:17.750 --> 06:16:17.760 align:start position:0%
as it increases and we also need a
 
06:16:19.868 --> 06:16:19.878 align:start position:0%
minimum payment in order to provide a
 
06:16:21.510 --> 06:16:21.520 align:start position:0%
data base if we're going to be doing
 
06:16:23.628 --> 06:16:23.638 align:start position:0%
this thing it we don't we have people
 
06:16:25.430 --> 06:16:25.440 align:start position:0%
that work for us under um other
 
06:16:27.110 --> 06:16:27.120 align:start position:0%
companies but but it would we're
 
06:16:29.190 --> 06:16:29.200 align:start position:0%
roughing it education guest probably
 
06:16:33.468 --> 06:16:33.478 align:start position:0%
100,000 in order to create this type of
 
06:16:36.350 --> 06:16:36.360 align:start position:0%
database okay thank you representative
 
06:16:38.510 --> 06:16:38.520 align:start position:0%
NAB thank you madam chair thank you for
 
06:16:40.350 --> 06:16:40.360 align:start position:0%
being here and taking my question um do
 
06:16:41.548 --> 06:16:41.558 align:start position:0%
you as a representative of the
 
06:16:42.910 --> 06:16:42.920 align:start position:0%
Department of Safety and the state
 
06:16:44.310 --> 06:16:44.320 align:start position:0%
police view this as something that would
 
06:16:45.708 --> 06:16:45.718 align:start position:0%
be useful to
 
06:16:48.868 --> 06:16:48.878 align:start position:0%
you to us particularly um some of us do
 
06:16:50.548 --> 06:16:50.558 align:start position:0%
work in smaller towns that aren't
 
06:16:52.230 --> 06:16:52.240 align:start position:0%
covered um not just in the highways in
 
06:16:54.430 --> 06:16:54.440 align:start position:0%
the North Country um some may find it
 
06:16:56.190 --> 06:16:56.200 align:start position:0%
useful I don't know that everybody would
 
06:16:58.150 --> 06:16:58.160 align:start position:0%
find this
 
06:17:00.270 --> 06:17:00.280 align:start position:0%
useful any other questions from the
 
06:17:02.350 --> 06:17:02.360 align:start position:0%
committee representative Murray thank
 
06:17:04.628 --> 06:17:04.638 align:start position:0%
you around the concept of the DAT data
 
06:17:07.830 --> 06:17:07.840 align:start position:0%
management and and that sort of um
 
06:17:10.190 --> 06:17:10.200 align:start position:0%
portion of things um when the photos
 
06:17:11.788 --> 06:17:11.798 align:start position:0%
would be taken or if they would be
 
06:17:15.468 --> 06:17:15.478 align:start position:0%
implemented in that photo how would all
 
06:17:17.750 --> 06:17:17.760 align:start position:0%
of that be expunged I mean how does that
 
06:17:18.868 --> 06:17:18.878 align:start position:0%
work the
 
06:17:21.910 --> 06:17:21.920 align:start position:0%
whole the whole record or like I guess
 
06:17:24.990 --> 06:17:25.000 align:start position:0%
that's my question would it be just be
 
06:17:28.310 --> 06:17:28.320 align:start position:0%
for I I guess that's my question sorry
 
06:17:29.628 --> 06:17:29.638 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question the way it's
 
06:17:32.030 --> 06:17:32.040 align:start position:0%
written I assume that the photo and
 
06:17:34.030 --> 06:17:34.040 align:start position:0%
everything on there would be expunged at
 
06:17:35.670 --> 06:17:35.680 align:start position:0%
that time just the way this is written
 
06:17:37.350 --> 06:17:37.360 align:start position:0%
here but again we don't really have any
 
06:17:39.190 --> 06:17:39.200 align:start position:0%
guidelines for that
 
06:17:41.230 --> 06:17:41.240 align:start position:0%
expungement any other questions
 
06:17:43.910 --> 06:17:43.920 align:start position:0%
representative Duty thank you madam
 
06:17:48.510 --> 06:17:48.520 align:start position:0%
chair um from the uh Bill sponsored um
 
06:17:49.788 --> 06:17:49.798 align:start position:0%
it's assumed that there's not going to
 
06:17:53.110 --> 06:17:53.120 align:start position:0%
be a lot of names on on this list and I
 
06:17:54.990 --> 06:17:55.000 align:start position:0%
mean it seems to me like it could almost
 
06:17:57.910 --> 06:17:57.920 align:start position:0%
be on like an ex spreadsheet so where do
 
06:17:59.350 --> 06:17:59.360 align:start position:0%
we get
 
06:18:02.548 --> 06:18:02.558 align:start position:0%
$150,000 for uh Staffing and I think
 
06:18:02.558 --> 06:18:03.270 align:start position:0%
$150,000 for uh Staffing and I think
another

06:18:03.270 --> 06:18:03.280 align:start position:0%
another
 
06:18:06.390 --> 06:18:06.400 align:start position:0%
$100,000 for the database I mean I mean
 
06:18:10.110 --> 06:18:10.120 align:start position:0%
let's assume our wildest we have 50
 
06:18:13.468 --> 06:18:13.478 align:start position:0%
names on it the wildest I mean a
 
06:18:16.990 --> 06:18:17.000 align:start position:0%
database of 50 would cost like $100,000
 
06:18:19.390 --> 06:18:19.400 align:start position:0%
and take one full person for well it's
 
06:18:20.948 --> 06:18:20.958 align:start position:0%
in order to create the database and
 
06:18:22.510 --> 06:18:22.520 align:start position:0%
right now we can't quantify how many
 
06:18:24.110 --> 06:18:24.120 align:start position:0%
people are going to be on that database
 
06:18:25.750 --> 06:18:25.760 align:start position:0%
so we have to air on the side of caution
 
06:18:27.750 --> 06:18:27.760 align:start position:0%
when when we're doing numbers because we
 
06:18:30.990 --> 06:18:31.000 align:start position:0%
may need someone in order to um watch
 
06:18:33.150 --> 06:18:33.160 align:start position:0%
this and take off the registry it's all
 
06:18:34.708 --> 06:18:34.718 align:start position:0%
depends on how it set up but it has to
 
06:18:36.830 --> 06:18:36.840 align:start position:0%
be set up in order for it to be utilized
 
06:18:40.350 --> 06:18:40.360 align:start position:0%
so the amount it takes to um set up that
 
06:18:42.230 --> 06:18:42.240 align:start position:0%
database to be created because it's a
 
06:18:45.670 --> 06:18:45.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:18:48.110 --> 06:18:48.120 align:start position:0%
different representative Murray thank
 
06:18:49.628 --> 06:18:49.638 align:start position:0%
you madam chair I do have another
 
06:18:51.230 --> 06:18:51.240 align:start position:0%
question with regard to the judicial
 
06:18:54.708 --> 06:18:54.718 align:start position:0%
system and the trial um we know that um
 
06:18:56.750 --> 06:18:56.760 align:start position:0%
courts are currently backed up and so if
 
06:18:59.468 --> 06:18:59.478 align:start position:0%
a person is is going through trial and
 
06:19:02.430 --> 06:19:02.440 align:start position:0%
is found um guilty or not guilty um do
 
06:19:04.270 --> 06:19:04.280 align:start position:0%
you see there being any delay in the
 
06:19:06.868 --> 06:19:06.878 align:start position:0%
addition or removal of anybody on or off
 
06:19:10.270 --> 06:19:10.280 align:start position:0%
of that database I can't speak for the
 
06:19:12.350 --> 06:19:12.360 align:start position:0%
court side I know they get delayed but
 
06:19:14.310 --> 06:19:14.320 align:start position:0%
there is sometimes a way to set up it
 
06:19:15.788 --> 06:19:15.798 align:start position:0%
that if there's something checked off in
 
06:19:17.270 --> 06:19:17.280 align:start position:0%
that box that maybe it comes over to the
 
06:19:19.468 --> 06:19:19.478 align:start position:0%
criminal records but that's something we
 
06:19:21.628 --> 06:19:21.638 align:start position:0%
have to explore when we look at the
 
06:19:24.830 --> 06:19:24.840 align:start position:0%
program okay any other
 
06:19:27.150 --> 06:19:27.160 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much for your
 
06:19:28.948 --> 06:19:28.958 align:start position:0%
testimony this afternoon we appreciate
 
06:19:50.948 --> 06:19:50.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:19:53.310 --> 06:19:53.320 align:start position:0%
ARA good afternoon members my name is
 
06:19:57.868 --> 06:19:57.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:00.990 --> 06:20:01.000 align:start position:0%
I've been pretty active in legislation
 
06:20:03.510 --> 06:20:03.520 align:start position:0%
for animals for several years
 
06:20:07.230 --> 06:20:07.240 align:start position:0%
now and in 2012 we had a very similar
 
06:20:08.788 --> 06:20:08.798 align:start position:0%
Bill to
 
06:20:11.030 --> 06:20:11.040 align:start position:0%
this there's only a couple things that I
 
06:20:13.948 --> 06:20:13.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:17.350 --> 06:20:17.360 align:start position:0%
say our animals may be our children but
 
06:20:18.910 --> 06:20:18.920 align:start position:0%
they're not
 
06:20:22.948 --> 06:20:22.958 align:start position:0%
children they are owned by us but we do
 
06:20:24.350 --> 06:20:24.360 align:start position:0%
treat them like
 
06:20:27.628 --> 06:20:27.638 align:start position:0%
children so so
 
06:20:30.708 --> 06:20:30.718 align:start position:0%
um just to let you know Tennessee is the
 
06:20:33.390 --> 06:20:33.400 align:start position:0%
only state in this Union that has an
 
06:20:35.230 --> 06:20:35.240 align:start position:0%
animal abuse
 
06:20:37.750 --> 06:20:37.760 align:start position:0%
registry several other states have
 
06:20:41.190 --> 06:20:41.200 align:start position:0%
declined including
 
06:20:44.948 --> 06:20:44.958 align:start position:0%
California so I don't understand the
 
06:20:48.350 --> 06:20:48.360 align:start position:0%
reason for this this is
 
06:20:50.990 --> 06:20:51.000 align:start position:0%
um at the
 
06:20:54.310 --> 06:20:54.320 align:start position:0%
time years ago I think the bill was
 
06:20:56.670 --> 06:20:56.680 align:start position:0%
withdrawn because there was so much
 
06:21:00.030 --> 06:21:00.040 align:start position:0%
opposition to it and I understand that
 
06:21:02.590 --> 06:21:02.600 align:start position:0%
there are evil people out there that do
 
06:21:02.600 --> 06:21:03.948 align:start position:0%
there are evil people out there that do
abuse

06:21:03.948 --> 06:21:03.958 align:start position:0%
abuse
 
06:21:07.910 --> 06:21:07.920 align:start position:0%
animals and I don't know how we
 
06:21:10.468 --> 06:21:10.478 align:start position:0%
distinguish them from somebody's
 
06:21:13.270 --> 06:21:13.280 align:start position:0%
mistake or do we just you know you're
 
06:21:14.948 --> 06:21:14.958 align:start position:0%
plus you're pitting neighbor against
 
06:21:18.390 --> 06:21:18.400 align:start position:0%
neighbor oh I saw them smack the dog
 
06:21:21.230 --> 06:21:21.240 align:start position:0%
well maybe the dog was doing something
 
06:21:23.350 --> 06:21:23.360 align:start position:0%
they really shouldn't have been
 
06:21:27.230 --> 06:21:27.240 align:start position:0%
doing so th that's another delery slope
 
06:21:30.788 --> 06:21:30.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:21:34.310 --> 06:21:34.320 align:start position:0%
say thank you any questions from the
 
06:21:37.070 --> 06:21:37.080 align:start position:0%
committee um do you feel yeah do you
 
06:21:40.270 --> 06:21:40.280 align:start position:0%
feel that uh people who may end up on
 
06:21:42.990 --> 06:21:43.000 align:start position:0%
this list would be targeted somehow yes
 
06:21:47.110 --> 06:21:47.120 align:start position:0%
I absolutely do and in what way well
 
06:21:50.590 --> 06:21:50.600 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of animal rights
 
06:21:53.350 --> 06:21:53.360 align:start position:0%
people that look for these
 
06:21:57.628 --> 06:21:57.638 align:start position:0%
things and then they go after abusers or
 
06:21:59.868 --> 06:21:59.878 align:start position:0%
people that they feel are
 
06:22:02.708 --> 06:22:02.718 align:start position:0%
abusers I've also seen other animal
 
06:22:04.948 --> 06:22:04.958 align:start position:0%
abuse Registries
 
06:22:09.030 --> 06:22:09.040 align:start position:0%
that animal activists set up and names
 
06:22:11.390 --> 06:22:11.400 align:start position:0%
never come off them
 
06:22:14.270 --> 06:22:14.280 align:start position:0%
never once you're on one of those lists
 
06:22:17.990 --> 06:22:18.000 align:start position:0%
you're on it for good you could be died
 
06:22:20.030 --> 06:22:20.040 align:start position:0%
you know you could have died but your
 
06:22:22.948 --> 06:22:22.958 align:start position:0%
name remains because nobody follows up
 
06:22:24.548 --> 06:22:24.558 align:start position:0%
on them there's
 
06:22:24.558 --> 06:22:26.548 align:start position:0%
on them there's
no

06:22:26.548 --> 06:22:26.558 align:start position:0%
no
 
06:22:28.830 --> 06:22:28.840 align:start position:0%
there's nobody watching that kind of
 
06:22:32.310 --> 06:22:32.320 align:start position:0%
stuff and for the state one of another
 
06:22:33.788 --> 06:22:33.798 align:start position:0%
big reason
 
06:22:33.798 --> 06:22:35.350 align:start position:0%
big reason
why

06:22:35.350 --> 06:22:35.360 align:start position:0%
why
 
06:22:39.430 --> 06:22:39.440 align:start position:0%
um New Hampshire was against it then and
 
06:22:42.390 --> 06:22:42.400 align:start position:0%
still is is the cost it's going to cost
 
06:22:45.030 --> 06:22:45.040 align:start position:0%
a lot of money couple of the handouts
 
06:22:48.030 --> 06:22:48.040 align:start position:0%
that I put here is some of the
 
06:22:52.190 --> 06:22:52.200 align:start position:0%
costs $22,000 and this this is something
 
06:22:56.510 --> 06:22:56.520 align:start position:0%
that I presented in 2012
 
06:22:58.548 --> 06:22:58.558 align:start position:0%
so you know that those costs are at
 
06:23:01.190 --> 06:23:01.200 align:start position:0%
least double now probably
 
06:23:04.868 --> 06:23:04.878 align:start position:0%
quadrupled because that was a long time
 
06:23:08.910 --> 06:23:08.920 align:start position:0%
ago and that at that time the suggestion
 
06:23:11.430 --> 06:23:11.440 align:start position:0%
was that uh the department of
 
06:23:15.510 --> 06:23:15.520 align:start position:0%
a make the registry and stay on top of
 
06:23:17.270 --> 06:23:17.280 align:start position:0%
it and they simply don't have the
 
06:23:20.270 --> 06:23:20.280 align:start position:0%
manpower to do it so I find it
 
06:23:23.150 --> 06:23:23.160 align:start position:0%
interesting that it has been
 
06:23:25.190 --> 06:23:25.200 align:start position:0%
suggested to go to the Department of
 
06:23:25.200 --> 06:23:27.190 align:start position:0%
suggested to go to the Department of
Safety

06:23:27.190 --> 06:23:27.200 align:start position:0%
Safety
 
06:23:29.510 --> 06:23:29.520 align:start position:0%
now somebody thinks they have the time
 
06:23:31.830 --> 06:23:31.840 align:start position:0%
to do it and the money I don't know I
 
06:23:35.190 --> 06:23:35.200 align:start position:0%
don't think it's money well spent for us
 
06:23:37.548 --> 06:23:37.558 align:start position:0%
this is the live freia die State even
 
06:23:39.110 --> 06:23:39.120 align:start position:0%
California said
 
06:23:41.910 --> 06:23:41.920 align:start position:0%
no any other questions from the
 
06:23:44.468 --> 06:23:44.478 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none thank you for your
 
06:23:47.430 --> 06:23:47.440 align:start position:0%
testimony did you have a question oh I'm
 
06:23:50.628 --> 06:23:50.638 align:start position:0%
sorry go ahead I was delinquent of
 
06:23:52.150 --> 06:23:52.160 align:start position:0%
raising my hand but thank you anyway and
 
06:23:54.110 --> 06:23:54.120 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question I I was
 
06:23:57.230 --> 06:23:57.240 align:start position:0%
just uh wanted to to see I understand
 
06:23:59.590 --> 06:23:59.600 align:start position:0%
the concern about people uh who have
 
06:24:02.230 --> 06:24:02.240 align:start position:0%
make mistakes right or or in someone
 
06:24:04.468 --> 06:24:04.478 align:start position:0%
else's perception make mistakes
 
06:24:06.750 --> 06:24:06.760 align:start position:0%
but what do you think about the fact
 
06:24:08.868 --> 06:24:08.878 align:start position:0%
that that for this proposed Bill we're
 
06:24:10.430 --> 06:24:10.440 align:start position:0%
talking about people who have been
 
06:24:13.468 --> 06:24:13.478 align:start position:0%
convicted right so the the idea that
 
06:24:15.430 --> 06:24:15.440 align:start position:0%
somebody might get caught up in the
 
06:24:17.310 --> 06:24:17.320 align:start position:0%
system for disciplining in a dog in a
 
06:24:19.510 --> 06:24:19.520 align:start position:0%
way someone else finds inappropriate I
 
06:24:22.230 --> 06:24:22.240 align:start position:0%
mean does that apply in this case or
 
06:24:26.030 --> 06:24:26.040 align:start position:0%
does does it help you at all does it
 
06:24:27.110 --> 06:24:27.120 align:start position:0%
make a difference to you that these
 
06:24:28.628 --> 06:24:28.638 align:start position:0%
people would have already been convicted
 
06:24:32.070 --> 06:24:32.080 align:start position:0%
of animal abuse based on current law so
 
06:24:34.070 --> 06:24:34.080 align:start position:0%
my question to you is how many people in
 
06:24:35.910 --> 06:24:35.920 align:start position:0%
the state have been convicted of animal
 
06:24:41.310 --> 06:24:41.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:24:44.270 --> 06:24:44.280 align:start position:0%
years I I I don't know but by my
 
06:24:47.990 --> 06:24:48.000 align:start position:0%
question response was that is is that
 
06:24:49.628 --> 06:24:49.638 align:start position:0%
just in terms of
 
06:24:53.468 --> 06:24:53.478 align:start position:0%
people being accused and put on this
 
06:24:54.670 --> 06:24:54.680 align:start position:0%
list even though they have done
 
06:24:56.110 --> 06:24:56.120 align:start position:0%
something that does not rise to the
 
06:24:57.670 --> 06:24:57.680 align:start position:0%
level of a criminal
 
06:25:01.750 --> 06:25:01.760 align:start position:0%
offense I'm sorry can you repeat
 
06:25:04.190 --> 06:25:04.200 align:start position:0%
that I I apologize I'm obviously not
 
06:25:07.110 --> 06:25:07.120 align:start position:0%
asking it very well but just does it
 
06:25:08.990 --> 06:25:09.000 align:start position:0%
make a difference that we are not
 
06:25:12.190 --> 06:25:12.200 align:start position:0%
talking about people who have done
 
06:25:13.868 --> 06:25:13.878 align:start position:0%
something that doesn't rise to the level
 
06:25:15.430 --> 06:25:15.440 align:start position:0%
of a criminal offense they have done
 
06:25:18.670 --> 06:25:18.680 align:start position:0%
something by Judgment of law that is
 
06:25:21.910 --> 06:25:21.920 align:start position:0%
Criminal by Nature okay I think I
 
06:25:24.270 --> 06:25:24.280 align:start position:0%
understand what you're saying so the one
 
06:25:26.110 --> 06:25:26.120 align:start position:0%
person that I know that was convicted of
 
06:25:26.120 --> 06:25:28.350 align:start position:0%
person that I know that was convicted of
animal

06:25:28.350 --> 06:25:28.360 align:start position:0%
animal
 
06:25:31.948 --> 06:25:31.958 align:start position:0%
abuse it was so sensationalized that
 
06:25:34.510 --> 06:25:34.520 align:start position:0%
nobody's ever going to forget that this
 
06:25:38.030 --> 06:25:38.040 align:start position:0%
happened okay so I don't know really of
 
06:25:42.990 --> 06:25:43.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:25:46.110 --> 06:25:46.120 align:start position:0%
convicted I'm sure there have been but I
 
06:25:47.868 --> 06:25:47.878 align:start position:0%
think that the the
 
06:25:50.628 --> 06:25:50.638 align:start position:0%
numbers don't warrant us spending the
 
06:25:53.510 --> 06:25:53.520 align:start position:0%
money for a
 
06:25:55.590 --> 06:25:55.600 align:start position:0%
registry okay thank you for taking my
 
06:25:56.990 --> 06:25:57.000 align:start position:0%
question I appreciate
 
06:26:01.990 --> 06:26:02.000 align:start position:0%

06:26:05.070 --> 06:26:05.080 align:start position:0%
upon your knowledge there's only um this
 
06:26:07.390 --> 06:26:07.400 align:start position:0%
bill in a sense would put one person on
 
06:26:09.548 --> 06:26:09.558 align:start position:0%
the registry that's what it seems like
 
06:26:12.468 --> 06:26:12.478 align:start position:0%
to me m okay well considering that's the
 
06:26:14.708 --> 06:26:14.718 align:start position:0%

you Miss chairman and committee members
 
06:26:44.830 --> 06:26:44.840 align:start position:0%
for allowing me to speak today it's
 
06:26:47.430 --> 06:26:47.440 align:start position:0%
interesting there's a a quote by Winston
 
06:26:48.830 --> 06:26:48.840 align:start position:0%
Churchill that really spoke to me in
 
06:26:50.390 --> 06:26:50.400 align:start position:0%
this moment something that I memorized
 
06:26:51.830 --> 06:26:51.840 align:start position:0%
in my math class when I was in like
 
06:26:55.708 --> 06:26:55.718 align:start position:0%
ninth grade and it went that for every
 
06:26:57.788 --> 06:26:57.798 align:start position:0%
individual there's a moment in their
 
06:27:01.190 --> 06:27:01.200 align:start position:0%
life that they come to that they were
 
06:27:04.190 --> 06:27:04.200 align:start position:0%
unaware that they were preparing for and
 
06:27:05.868 --> 06:27:05.878 align:start position:0%
it's a Pity if that moment comes and
 
06:27:07.788 --> 06:27:07.798 align:start position:0%
finds them unprepared or unqualified for
 
06:27:09.910 --> 06:27:09.920 align:start position:0%
that which could have been their finest
 
06:27:13.270 --> 06:27:13.280 align:start position:0%
Hour as strong a statement as it may
 
06:27:14.868 --> 06:27:14.878 align:start position:0%
seem to you I feel like this is that
 
06:27:17.708 --> 06:27:17.718 align:start position:0%
moment for me as long as I can remember
 
06:27:19.468 --> 06:27:19.478 align:start position:0%
animals have been my
 
06:27:21.830 --> 06:27:21.840 align:start position:0%

in Salem New Hampshire working as an
 
06:27:33.510 --> 06:27:33.520 align:start position:0%
animal control officer is often
 
06:27:35.230 --> 06:27:35.240 align:start position:0%
considered a calling it demands
 
06:27:37.628 --> 06:27:37.638 align:start position:0%
unwavering dedication and resilience as
 
06:27:39.948 --> 06:27:39.958 align:start position:0%
we confront physical challenges mental
 
06:27:42.830 --> 06:27:42.840 align:start position:0%
strain and the profound emotional toll
 
06:27:44.948 --> 06:27:44.958 align:start position:0%
of our work from making tough decisions
 
06:27:46.628 --> 06:27:46.638 align:start position:0%
like euthanizing injured animals due to
 
06:27:49.070 --> 06:27:49.080 align:start position:0%
a lack of financial resources to forming
 
06:27:50.708 --> 06:27:50.718 align:start position:0%
attachments with pets who we know are
 
06:27:52.948 --> 06:27:52.958 align:start position:0%
bound to return to less than ideal
 
06:27:55.190 --> 06:27:55.200 align:start position:0%
living conditions the risk of burnout
 
06:27:58.150 --> 06:27:58.160 align:start position:0%
and compassion fatigue is a constant
 
06:28:00.270 --> 06:28:00.280 align:start position:0%
companion despite these challenges the
 
06:28:02.070 --> 06:28:02.080 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Animal Control Officers
 
06:28:03.948 --> 06:28:03.958 align:start position:0%
consistently show up day in and day out
 
06:28:06.310 --> 06:28:06.320 align:start position:0%
to Aid those in need and pursue Justice
 
06:28:09.110 --> 06:28:09.120 align:start position:0%
in cases of animal cruelty however the
 
06:28:11.670 --> 06:28:11.680 align:start position:0%
reality is strongly disheartening few
 
06:28:14.310 --> 06:28:14.320 align:start position:0%
Cru cruelty cases make it to court and
 
06:28:16.750 --> 06:28:16.760 align:start position:0%
even fewer result in convictions
 
06:28:19.270 --> 06:28:19.280 align:start position:0%
moreover convicted offenders often face
 
06:28:21.230 --> 06:28:21.240 align:start position:0%
minimal consequences and can easily
 
06:28:23.750 --> 06:28:23.760 align:start position:0%
obtain new animals or continue operating
 
06:28:25.830 --> 06:28:25.840 align:start position:0%
in animal related businesses due to the
 
06:28:28.230 --> 06:28:28.240 align:start position:0%
absence of a centralized public
 
06:28:30.670 --> 06:28:30.680 align:start position:0%
registry animal cruelty isn't just a
 
06:28:33.430 --> 06:28:33.440 align:start position:0%
matter of harming animals it's often
 
06:28:35.868 --> 06:28:35.878 align:start position:0%
reflects deeper psychological distress
 
06:28:37.750 --> 06:28:37.760 align:start position:0%
and may signal a propensity for violence
 
06:28:40.110 --> 06:28:40.120 align:start position:0%
against humans as well research in
 
06:28:42.628 --> 06:28:42.638 align:start position:0%
Psychology sociology and criminology
 
06:28:44.310 --> 06:28:44.320 align:start position:0%
consistently highlight the correlation
 
06:28:46.110 --> 06:28:46.120 align:start position:0%
between animal cruelty and subsequent
 
06:28:48.830 --> 06:28:48.840 align:start position:0%
violent Behavior recognizing this
 
06:28:50.548 --> 06:28:50.558 align:start position:0%
establishing a registry of individuals
 
06:28:52.628 --> 06:28:52.638 align:start position:0%
convicted of animal cruelty is crucial
 
06:28:54.510 --> 06:28:54.520 align:start position:0%
for identifying potential threats to
 
06:28:58.190 --> 06:28:58.200 align:start position:0%
both animal and humans House Bill 1505
 
06:28:59.788 --> 06:28:59.798 align:start position:0%
proposes the creation of an animal
 
06:29:02.310 --> 06:29:02.320 align:start position:0%
cruelty registry to address these issues
 
06:29:04.070 --> 06:29:04.080 align:start position:0%
such a registry would serve multiple
 
06:29:06.030 --> 06:29:06.040 align:start position:0%
purposes firstly it would protect
 
06:29:07.868 --> 06:29:07.878 align:start position:0%
domestic animals in New Hampshire by
 
06:29:09.430 --> 06:29:09.440 align:start position:0%
providing accessible information about
 
06:29:11.548 --> 06:29:11.558 align:start position:0%
convicted abusers this empowers pet
 
06:29:13.628 --> 06:29:13.638 align:start position:0%
owners shelters and rescue organizations
 
06:29:16.030 --> 06:29:16.040 align:start position:0%
to make informed decisions ultimately
 
06:29:17.468 --> 06:29:17.478 align:start position:0%
preventing animals from being placed in
 
06:29:19.788 --> 06:29:19.798 align:start position:0%
harmful environments secondly it would
 
06:29:21.468 --> 06:29:21.478 align:start position:0%
hold individuals accountable for their
 
06:29:23.310 --> 06:29:23.320 align:start position:0%
actions and deter future instances of
 
06:29:26.150 --> 06:29:26.160 align:start position:0%
Cruelty by publicly listing the names of
 
06:29:28.430 --> 06:29:28.440 align:start position:0%
convicted abusers the registry acts as a
 
06:29:30.270 --> 06:29:30.280 align:start position:0%
deterrent sending a clear message that
 
06:29:31.830 --> 06:29:31.840 align:start position:0%
animal abuse will not be tolerated in
 
06:29:34.190 --> 06:29:34.200 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire moreover a
 
06:29:35.910 --> 06:29:35.920 align:start position:0%
centralized registry of animal abusers
 
06:29:37.590 --> 06:29:37.600 align:start position:0%
streamlines the process for law
 
06:29:39.548 --> 06:29:39.558 align:start position:0%
enforcement agencies to gain details on
 
06:29:41.468 --> 06:29:41.478 align:start position:0%
individuals with a history of animal
 
06:29:44.350 --> 06:29:44.360 align:start position:0%
cruelty by convictions to interrupt my
 
06:29:47.670 --> 06:29:47.680 align:start position:0%
own speech as it currently stands unless
 
06:29:50.190 --> 06:29:50.200 align:start position:0%
you show up in our local the majority of
 
06:29:51.788 --> 06:29:51.798 align:start position:0%
Animal Control Officers in the state do
 
06:29:54.230 --> 06:29:54.240 align:start position:0%
not have any access to that information
 
06:29:54.240 --> 06:29:55.350 align:start position:0%
not have any access to that information
meaning

06:29:55.350 --> 06:29:55.360 align:start position:0%
meaning
 
06:29:57.310 --> 06:29:57.320 align:start position:0%
that I would not know if you commit
 
06:29:59.390 --> 06:29:59.400 align:start position:0%
committed animal cruelty a town over if
 
06:30:00.868 --> 06:30:00.878 align:start position:0%
you are not currently showing up in the
 
06:30:02.030 --> 06:30:02.040 align:start position:0%
local in my
 
06:30:04.390 --> 06:30:04.400 align:start position:0%
town by providing easy access to
 
06:30:05.990 --> 06:30:06.000 align:start position:0%
pertinent information the registry
 
06:30:08.190 --> 06:30:08.200 align:start position:0%
facilitates investigations into new
 
06:30:10.310 --> 06:30:10.320 align:start position:0%
cases of animal abuse and enables Animal
 
06:30:11.590 --> 06:30:11.600 align:start position:0%
Control Officers and other law
 
06:30:13.350 --> 06:30:13.360 align:start position:0%
enforcement officers to investigate
 
06:30:16.030 --> 06:30:16.040 align:start position:0%
promptly when necessary this in turn
 
06:30:18.910 --> 06:30:18.920 align:start position:0%
helps ensure Swift Justice For Animals
 
06:30:20.830 --> 06:30:20.840 align:start position:0%
additionally the registry would identify
 
06:30:22.708 --> 06:30:22.718 align:start position:0%
individuals involved in illegal animal
 
06:30:24.150 --> 06:30:24.160 align:start position:0%
fighting and puppy mills further

safeguarding an Animal Welfare
 
06:30:28.510 --> 06:30:28.520 align:start position:0%
ultimately Beyond preventing future
 
06:30:30.750 --> 06:30:30.760 align:start position:0%
cruelty the registry promotes positive
 
06:30:32.590 --> 06:30:32.600 align:start position:0%
behavioral change and contributes to the
 
06:30:34.670 --> 06:30:34.680 align:start position:0%

06:31:26.510 --> 06:31:26.520 align:start position:0%
you explain kind of how that works
 
06:31:29.230 --> 06:31:29.240 align:start position:0%
because as you're saying if it's not uh
 
06:31:30.910 --> 06:31:30.920 align:start position:0%
if you don't have that information in
 
06:31:33.468 --> 06:31:33.478 align:start position:0%
your town it was committed to town over
 
06:31:37.070 --> 06:31:37.080 align:start position:0%
so could could you explain to us how
 
06:31:40.590 --> 06:31:40.600 align:start position:0%
current um law Works in terms of
 
06:31:42.430 --> 06:31:42.440 align:start position:0%
preventing someone who's convicted from
 
06:31:45.510 --> 06:31:45.520 align:start position:0%
getting a pet thank you so much for that
 
06:31:47.830 --> 06:31:47.840 align:start position:0%
question I appreciate it I like to
 
06:31:50.110 --> 06:31:50.120 align:start position:0%
describe our current legislation
 
06:31:53.868 --> 06:31:53.878 align:start position:0%
regarding that so RSA 644 Section 8 as a
 
06:31:56.030 --> 06:31:56.040 align:start position:0%
Civ there's a lot of loopholes and if
 
06:31:57.310 --> 06:31:57.320 align:start position:0%
you're using it as a bucket to hold
 
06:32:00.230 --> 06:32:00.240 align:start position:0%
water it's useless so as it stands if
 
06:32:02.670 --> 06:32:02.680 align:start position:0%
you commit a crime and it would be a
 
06:32:05.190 --> 06:32:05.200 align:start position:0%
miracle on itself if the judge decides
 
06:32:06.910 --> 06:32:06.920 align:start position:0%
that they want to remove that animal for
 
06:32:09.190 --> 06:32:09.200 align:start position:0%
one to five years it is not a shall
 
06:32:11.510 --> 06:32:11.520 align:start position:0%
statement that judge has the discretion
 
06:32:13.350 --> 06:32:13.360 align:start position:0%
thereof to make the decision as to
 
06:32:14.468 --> 06:32:14.478 align:start position:0%
whether or not they're going to charge
 
06:32:16.468 --> 06:32:16.478 align:start position:0%
you in a position in which you can no
 
06:32:18.310 --> 06:32:18.320 align:start position:0%
longer have pets or be around pets so on
 
06:32:21.388 --> 06:32:21.398 align:start position:0%
so forth that very very rarely happens
 
06:32:23.948 --> 06:32:23.958 align:start position:0%
in fact in many cases in which I finally
 
06:32:26.070 --> 06:32:26.080 align:start position:0%
get to court with an animal cruelty
 
06:32:29.350 --> 06:32:29.360 align:start position:0%
conviction case the charge is deferred
 
06:32:31.070 --> 06:32:31.080 align:start position:0%
for a number of years pending the fact
 
06:32:33.190 --> 06:32:33.200 align:start position:0%
that they not do anything that could be
 
06:32:34.990 --> 06:32:35.000 align:start position:0%
considered animal cruelty in that time
 
06:32:37.868 --> 06:32:37.878 align:start position:0%
period so the likelihood that you
 
06:32:40.868 --> 06:32:40.878 align:start position:0%
actually earn and I say it strongly earn
 
06:32:42.948 --> 06:32:42.958 align:start position:0%
the status of an offender in animal
 
06:32:45.910 --> 06:32:45.920 align:start position:0%
cruelty is extremely rare not because it
 
06:32:48.468 --> 06:32:48.478 align:start position:0%
doesn't happen but because most towns
 
06:32:50.150 --> 06:32:50.160 align:start position:0%
don't want to take it to court our
 
06:32:51.388 --> 06:32:51.398 align:start position:0%
prosecutors don't always know how to
 
06:32:52.990 --> 06:32:53.000 align:start position:0%
prosecute it so they won't thankfully
 
06:32:55.388 --> 06:32:55.398 align:start position:0%
mine does two
 
06:32:57.150 --> 06:32:57.160 align:start position:0%
you're very unlikely to actually get
 
06:32:58.510 --> 06:32:58.520 align:start position:0%
sentenced because a lot of those are
 
06:33:02.070 --> 06:33:02.080 align:start position:0%
deferred sentences and three you're very
 
06:33:04.030 --> 06:33:04.040 align:start position:0%
very unlikely to have your animals taken
 
06:33:06.230 --> 06:33:06.240 align:start position:0%
away and if that does happen unless you
 
06:33:08.670 --> 06:33:08.680 align:start position:0%
show up in the local systems in the town
 
06:33:11.190 --> 06:33:11.200 align:start position:0%
that the Animal control officer Works in
 
06:33:12.948 --> 06:33:12.958 align:start position:0%
they're not going to know that you have
 
06:33:14.670 --> 06:33:14.680 align:start position:0%
that held against you so you could show
 
06:33:16.270 --> 06:33:16.280 align:start position:0%
up with a dog in sail in New Hampshire
 
06:33:18.230 --> 06:33:18.240 align:start position:0%
having been convicted in Windam unless I
 
06:33:20.788 --> 06:33:20.798 align:start position:0%
have information on you in our local I
 
06:33:22.628 --> 06:33:22.638 align:start position:0%
don't know that you can't have a dog and
 
06:33:24.830 --> 06:33:24.840 align:start position:0%
I'm going to work on Education First as
 
06:33:27.110 --> 06:33:27.120 align:start position:0%
I always do I always give Ben people the
 
06:33:29.548 --> 06:33:29.558 align:start position:0%
benefit of the doubt to begin with so
 
06:33:30.910 --> 06:33:30.920 align:start position:0%
that person's going to continue to be
 
06:33:33.310 --> 06:33:33.320 align:start position:0%
treated by myself and any other law
 
06:33:35.548 --> 06:33:35.558 align:start position:0%
enforcement officer in my town like they
 
06:33:37.388 --> 06:33:37.398 align:start position:0%
haven't done anything wrong by
 
06:33:39.150 --> 06:33:39.160 align:start position:0%
forgetting to feed the dog for a couple
 
06:33:42.990 --> 06:33:43.000 align:start position:0%
days asle yes thank you very much
 
06:33:47.468 --> 06:33:47.478 align:start position:0%
Duty thank you madam chair um I
 
06:33:50.350 --> 06:33:50.360 align:start position:0%
understand what you're saying and um
 
06:33:52.788 --> 06:33:52.798 align:start position:0%
commissioner Jasper has been here many
 
06:33:55.190 --> 06:33:55.200 align:start position:0%
times talking about the to
 
06:33:58.548 --> 06:33:58.558 align:start position:0%
that animal cruelty cases take on his
 
06:34:02.190 --> 06:34:02.200 align:start position:0%
employees um but uh and I and I see what
 
06:34:05.070 --> 06:34:05.080 align:start position:0%
you want to do here except that in order
 
06:34:07.830 --> 06:34:07.840 align:start position:0%
to get on the registry you have to be
 
06:34:10.110 --> 06:34:10.120 align:start position:0%
convicted and I and I hear what you're
 
06:34:12.110 --> 06:34:12.120 align:start position:0%
saying is getting a conviction is very
 
06:34:14.548 --> 06:34:14.558 align:start position:0%
hard commissioner Jasper has told us
 
06:34:16.990 --> 06:34:17.000 align:start position:0%
getting convictions are very hard uh
 
06:34:20.868 --> 06:34:20.878 align:start position:0%
primarily due to the finances if a town
 
06:34:22.788 --> 06:34:22.798 align:start position:0%
takes somebody to court then they have
 
06:34:25.388 --> 06:34:25.398 align:start position:0%
to take possession of the animals and
 
06:34:27.628 --> 06:34:27.638 align:start position:0%
you know while the court case is going
 
06:34:29.910 --> 06:34:29.920 align:start position:0%
on and towns don't want to take on a
 
06:34:32.910 --> 06:34:32.920 align:start position:0%
financial responsibility so I don't
 
06:34:35.868 --> 06:34:35.878 align:start position:0%
understand if you have to be convicted
 
06:34:38.030 --> 06:34:38.040 align:start position:0%
to get on the list and convictions are
 
06:34:41.150 --> 06:34:41.160 align:start position:0%
few and far between how is the spill
 
06:34:44.190 --> 06:34:44.200 align:start position:0%
going to really help the situation that
 
06:34:46.670 --> 06:34:46.680 align:start position:0%
needs to be addressed I agree no thank
 
06:34:48.548 --> 06:34:48.558 align:start position:0%
you I appreciate that question and I
 
06:34:50.030 --> 06:34:50.040 align:start position:0%
appreciate you giving me the opportunity
 
06:34:53.990 --> 06:34:54.000 align:start position:0%
to clarify so it isn't about necessarily
 
06:34:57.030 --> 06:34:57.040 align:start position:0%
being punitive or punishing somebody who
 
06:34:59.510 --> 06:34:59.520 align:start position:0%
has been convicted of animal cruelty
 
06:35:01.030 --> 06:35:01.040 align:start position:0%
it's about having a record in the
 
06:35:03.350 --> 06:35:03.360 align:start position:0%
knowledge that that has happened um as I
 
06:35:05.030 --> 06:35:05.040 align:start position:0%
mentioned before a lot of our Animal
 
06:35:06.670 --> 06:35:06.680 align:start position:0%
Control Officers are not provided the
 
06:35:08.110 --> 06:35:08.120 align:start position:0%
opportunity to go to the part-time
 
06:35:10.468 --> 06:35:10.478 align:start position:0%
Academy and become certified officers
 
06:35:12.430 --> 06:35:12.440 align:start position:0%
meaning the only information they have
 
06:35:14.548 --> 06:35:14.558 align:start position:0%
if any is something called the local
 
06:35:16.110 --> 06:35:16.120 align:start position:0%
which is a small computerized system
 
06:35:17.548 --> 06:35:17.558 align:start position:0%
within each department that gives
 
06:35:19.468 --> 06:35:19.478 align:start position:0%
information about the people who live in
 
06:35:21.230 --> 06:35:21.240 align:start position:0%
the town sometimes we'll have
 
06:35:22.788 --> 06:35:22.798 align:start position:0%
information about people outside of the
 
06:35:24.750 --> 06:35:24.760 align:start position:0%
town for example you got a speeding
 
06:35:26.830 --> 06:35:26.840 align:start position:0%
ticket in our town I know your name and
 
06:35:29.110 --> 06:35:29.120 align:start position:0%
phone number now that's excellent it
 
06:35:30.270 --> 06:35:30.280 align:start position:0%
doesn't tell me whether or not you can
 
06:35:32.070 --> 06:35:32.080 align:start position:0%
own a dog or whether or not you've hurt
 
06:35:34.868 --> 06:35:34.878 align:start position:0%
an animal in the past this bill would
 
06:35:36.990 --> 06:35:37.000 align:start position:0%
allow me to then look that person up in
 
06:35:39.388 --> 06:35:39.398 align:start position:0%
a different system an open
 
06:35:41.788 --> 06:35:41.798 align:start position:0%
system giving me the information I need
 
06:35:43.430 --> 06:35:43.440 align:start position:0%
to know how I'm going to move forward
 
06:35:46.708 --> 06:35:46.718 align:start position:0%
with that specific case on a daily basis
 
06:35:49.070 --> 06:35:49.080 align:start position:0%
I investigate animal cruelty that's most
 
06:35:51.270 --> 06:35:51.280 align:start position:0%
of what I do and I go into people's
 
06:35:54.350 --> 06:35:54.360 align:start position:0%
homes with a two-page booklet with about
 
06:35:56.948 --> 06:35:56.958 align:start position:0%
75 different questions on it and I check
 
06:35:58.948 --> 06:35:58.958 align:start position:0%
each box and each box is a different
 
06:36:00.310 --> 06:36:00.320 align:start position:0%
statement as to whether or not I feel
 
06:36:01.830 --> 06:36:01.840 align:start position:0%
that this animal has everything it needs
 
06:36:04.430 --> 06:36:04.440 align:start position:0%
to be in a safe and healthy environment
 
06:36:06.070 --> 06:36:06.080 align:start position:0%
I'm going to be a lot more lenient with
 
06:36:08.030 --> 06:36:08.040 align:start position:0%
someone who I don't believe has any
 
06:36:10.670 --> 06:36:10.680 align:start position:0%
history of animal cruelty than I would
 
06:36:12.830 --> 06:36:12.840 align:start position:0%
be with someone who I know does simply
 
06:36:14.670 --> 06:36:14.680 align:start position:0%
because I would be looking for different
 
06:36:17.190 --> 06:36:17.200 align:start position:0%
indicators different things this would
 
06:36:19.310 --> 06:36:19.320 align:start position:0%
give me that
 
06:36:22.868 --> 06:36:22.878 align:start position:0%
ability representative
 
06:36:25.830 --> 06:36:25.840 align:start position:0%
Penza I think I want to piggy back on
 
06:36:28.788 --> 06:36:28.798 align:start position:0%
representative Duty's question how many
 
06:36:30.948 --> 06:36:30.958 align:start position:0%
convictions since you've been working in
 
06:36:34.230 --> 06:36:34.240 align:start position:0%
the department have how many how many um
 
06:36:36.350 --> 06:36:36.360 align:start position:0%
convictions the only conviction I've
 
06:36:39.310 --> 06:36:39.320 align:start position:0%
gotten to see was deferred they the
 
06:36:41.548 --> 06:36:41.558 align:start position:0%
judge at the time told me that they
 
06:36:43.510 --> 06:36:43.520 align:start position:0%
wanted to see this person have more
 
06:36:45.388 --> 06:36:45.398 align:start position:0%
education brought to them which was
 
06:36:47.270 --> 06:36:47.280 align:start position:0%
surprising to me because we had already
 
06:36:48.830 --> 06:36:48.840 align:start position:0%
done our best to educate him by the time
 
06:36:51.350 --> 06:36:51.360 align:start position:0%
he got there um they didn't even have a
 
06:36:53.510 --> 06:36:53.520 align:start position:0%
system for how that education's done
 
06:36:55.110 --> 06:36:55.120 align:start position:0%
because it's so un precedented they
 
06:36:56.590 --> 06:36:56.600 align:start position:0%
don't know how to handle it when animal
 
06:36:58.830 --> 06:36:58.840 align:start position:0%
cruelty happens so I had to invent a
 
06:37:00.750 --> 06:37:00.760 align:start position:0%
brand new class for this person to take
 
06:37:02.468 --> 06:37:02.478 align:start position:0%
so that they could learn how to better
 
06:37:04.468 --> 06:37:04.478 align:start position:0%
handle their animals I would like to
 
06:37:06.350 --> 06:37:06.360 align:start position:0%
State without specific information about
 
06:37:08.788 --> 06:37:08.798 align:start position:0%
that case that this person was there for
 
06:37:10.510 --> 06:37:10.520 align:start position:0%
leaving their dogs in a hot environment
 
06:37:13.110 --> 06:37:13.120 align:start position:0%
on multiple occasions in our town alone
 
06:37:14.590 --> 06:37:14.600 align:start position:0%
let alone what I learned later which is
 
06:37:16.030 --> 06:37:16.040 align:start position:0%
that he done it in multiple other towns
 
06:37:17.670 --> 06:37:17.680 align:start position:0%
as well without having been brought to
 
06:37:20.230 --> 06:37:20.240 align:start position:0%
court he brought his dogs to court that
 
06:37:22.590 --> 06:37:22.600 align:start position:0%
day and left them in the car so these
 
06:37:24.270 --> 06:37:24.280 align:start position:0%
kind of things continue to build and
 
06:37:27.230 --> 06:37:27.240 align:start position:0%
continue to happen follow up though
 
06:37:30.270 --> 06:37:30.280 align:start position:0%
follow up but this is one but this
 
06:37:32.310 --> 06:37:32.320 align:start position:0%
person wasn't convicted or they were it
 
06:37:35.388 --> 06:37:35.398 align:start position:0%
was it was um deferred so they weren't
 
06:37:38.190 --> 06:37:38.200 align:start position:0%
convicted at that time meaning that I
 
06:37:40.030 --> 06:37:40.040 align:start position:0%
don't have any currently happening
 
06:37:41.388 --> 06:37:41.398 align:start position:0%
however I've only been in Salem
 
06:37:43.708 --> 06:37:43.718 align:start position:0%
specifically for a year so that is a
 
06:37:46.030 --> 06:37:46.040 align:start position:0%
very small amount of time that said it
 
06:37:48.510 --> 06:37:48.520 align:start position:0%
just goes to show how rarely this
 
06:37:49.910 --> 06:37:49.920 align:start position:0%
conviction actually happens so we're not
 
06:37:51.948 --> 06:37:51.958 align:start position:0%
going to have people who don't I guess
 
06:37:53.350 --> 06:37:53.360 align:start position:0%
you could say deserve to be on that list
 
06:37:54.708 --> 06:37:54.718 align:start position:0%
end up there
 
06:37:56.628 --> 06:37:56.638 align:start position:0%
that's why but this bill wouldn't help
 
06:38:00.030 --> 06:38:00.040 align:start position:0%
you though because this how the Bill's
 
06:38:01.548 --> 06:38:01.558 align:start position:0%
written is not going to provide you the
 
06:38:03.750 --> 06:38:03.760 align:start position:0%
information that you'd like it I mean
 
06:38:05.708 --> 06:38:05.718 align:start position:0%
you're you're amazing by the way I just
 
06:38:08.510 --> 06:38:08.520 align:start position:0%
have to say that just your testimony and
 
06:38:10.510 --> 06:38:10.520 align:start position:0%
your presence it's it's wonderful and
 
06:38:12.388 --> 06:38:12.398 align:start position:0%
you can tell that you love what you do
 
06:38:14.070 --> 06:38:14.080 align:start position:0%
but this bill is not going to give you
 
06:38:17.030 --> 06:38:17.040 align:start position:0%
that information that you're looking for
 
06:38:19.830 --> 06:38:19.840 align:start position:0%
May I respond before we jump to the next
 
06:38:21.350 --> 06:38:21.360 align:start position:0%
thank you I'm so sorry I don't want to
 
06:38:23.830 --> 06:38:23.840 align:start position:0%
cut you off again um and thank you for
 
06:38:26.990 --> 06:38:27.000 align:start position:0%
your com compliment as far as what I'm
 
06:38:29.670 --> 06:38:29.680 align:start position:0%
looking for from this and where many
 
06:38:31.670 --> 06:38:31.680 align:start position:0%
people behind me are also looking for
 
06:38:33.590 --> 06:38:33.600 align:start position:0%
because I got the original idea for this
 
06:38:35.350 --> 06:38:35.360 align:start position:0%
by being asked on multiple occasions by
 
06:38:37.350 --> 06:38:37.360 align:start position:0%
different shelters where the registry
 
06:38:38.830 --> 06:38:38.840 align:start position:0%
list was and I had to inform them it
 
06:38:40.670 --> 06:38:40.680 align:start position:0%
didn't exist I've also been asked by
 
06:38:42.868 --> 06:38:42.878 align:start position:0%
multiple acos when this was going to
 
06:38:45.830 --> 06:38:45.840 align:start position:0%
happen but it doesn't exist so the
 
06:38:47.310 --> 06:38:47.320 align:start position:0%
information we're looking for is not
 
06:38:50.270 --> 06:38:50.280 align:start position:0%
only going to potentially help for now
 
06:38:52.270 --> 06:38:52.280 align:start position:0%
but help for moving forward when our
 
06:38:53.750 --> 06:38:53.760 align:start position:0%
laws are in a position or when we have
 
06:38:57.230 --> 06:38:57.240 align:start position:0%
enough of a a knowledge based to convict
 
06:38:59.270 --> 06:38:59.280 align:start position:0%
people I want to see this already in
 
06:39:01.430 --> 06:39:01.440 align:start position:0%
place to build upon because right now
 
06:39:02.990 --> 06:39:03.000 align:start position:0%
there could be more cruelty cases out
 
06:39:05.430 --> 06:39:05.440 align:start position:0%
there that there are convictions on but
 
06:39:07.150 --> 06:39:07.160 align:start position:0%
I just don't know and I have no way of
 
06:39:08.708 --> 06:39:08.718 align:start position:0%
getting that information your question
 
06:39:10.750 --> 06:39:10.760 align:start position:0%
is an excellent one I wish I could
 
06:39:13.150 --> 06:39:13.160 align:start position:0%
answer it it simply isn't available
 
06:39:15.910 --> 06:39:15.920 align:start position:0%
because the state Bas doesn't exist
 
06:39:18.830 --> 06:39:18.840 align:start position:0%
yet representative comto thank you madam
 
06:39:20.430 --> 06:39:20.440 align:start position:0%
chair and again thank you for being here
 
06:39:23.190 --> 06:39:23.200 align:start position:0%
and thank you uh for taking my question
 
06:39:24.590 --> 06:39:24.600 align:start position:0%
you mentioned in your
 
06:39:28.388 --> 06:39:28.398 align:start position:0%
testimony that the rsaa says
 
06:39:31.430 --> 06:39:31.440 align:start position:0%
may um and I'm looking here it says upon
 
06:39:33.548 --> 06:39:33.558 align:start position:0%
a person's conviction of cruelty to
 
06:39:36.868 --> 06:39:36.878 align:start position:0%
animals the court shall dispose of the
 
06:39:40.910 --> 06:39:40.920 align:start position:0%
confiscated animal um so they must of
 
06:39:43.270 --> 06:39:43.280 align:start position:0%
the confiscated animal yes however that
 
06:39:44.750 --> 06:39:44.760 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean that the animal that wasn't
 
06:39:46.590 --> 06:39:46.600 align:start position:0%
abused that's in their home has to be
 
06:39:49.230 --> 06:39:49.240 align:start position:0%
removed so let's say you've got two dogs
 
06:39:52.510 --> 06:39:52.520 align:start position:0%
fluffy and Spike and you abused fluffy
 
06:39:54.070 --> 06:39:54.080 align:start position:0%
Spike doesn't necessarily have to be
 
06:39:57.030 --> 06:39:57.040 align:start position:0%
moved representative com tomor thank you
 
06:39:59.150 --> 06:39:59.160 align:start position:0%
and I appreciate what you're saying but
 
06:40:00.868 --> 06:40:00.878 align:start position:0%
you under convictions and under the
 
06:40:03.590 --> 06:40:03.600 align:start position:0%
cruelty laws It also says it will
 
06:40:05.350 --> 06:40:05.360 align:start position:0%
prohibit you from future ownership of
 
06:40:07.868 --> 06:40:07.878 align:start position:0%
animals for up to five years for up to
 
06:40:09.590 --> 06:40:09.600 align:start position:0%
five years but that's a desp for a
 
06:40:11.868 --> 06:40:11.878 align:start position:0%
minimum of 5 years not up to for a
 
06:40:13.750 --> 06:40:13.760 align:start position:0%
minimum of five years so even though
 
06:40:15.388 --> 06:40:15.398 align:start position:0%
they may have another animal in the home
 
06:40:18.910 --> 06:40:18.920 align:start position:0%
they are forbidden from owning that
 
06:40:22.030 --> 06:40:22.040 align:start position:0%
animal it doesn't however prevent their
 
06:40:24.468 --> 06:40:24.478 align:start position:0%
roommate spouse anyone else who has Co
 
06:40:26.788 --> 06:40:26.798 align:start position:0%
ownership Potential from owning the
 
06:40:28.948 --> 06:40:28.958 align:start position:0%
animal which can be easily switched over
 
06:40:32.830 --> 06:40:32.840 align:start position:0%
um that said even so reviewing that law
 
06:40:34.510 --> 06:40:34.520 align:start position:0%
I can't quote it precisely I'm going to
 
06:40:36.430 --> 06:40:36.440 align:start position:0%
be honest I have most of them memorized
 
06:40:37.910 --> 06:40:37.920 align:start position:0%
that one I don't have word for word
 
06:40:40.548 --> 06:40:40.558 align:start position:0%
memorized um for my understanding and
 
06:40:42.468 --> 06:40:42.478 align:start position:0%
how it's been actually acted out in
 
06:40:45.388 --> 06:40:45.398 align:start position:0%
court the judge has the ability to say
 
06:40:46.510 --> 06:40:46.520 align:start position:0%
whether or not they're going to actually
 
06:40:46.520 --> 06:40:47.830 align:start position:0%
whether or not they're going to actually
do

06:40:47.830 --> 06:40:47.840 align:start position:0%
do
 
06:40:50.628 --> 06:40:50.638 align:start position:0%
that representative H Haskins thank you
 
06:40:52.948 --> 06:40:52.958 align:start position:0%
madam chair I want to Second what um
 
06:40:56.468 --> 06:40:56.478 align:start position:0%
representative put T said you do a very
 
06:40:58.590 --> 06:40:58.600 align:start position:0%
difficult job and you present yourself
 
06:41:01.310 --> 06:41:01.320 align:start position:0%
amazingly well I'm curious to how you
 
06:41:04.708 --> 06:41:04.718 align:start position:0%
get call to a given household how does
 
06:41:08.070 --> 06:41:08.080 align:start position:0%
that happen can you elaborate a little
 
06:41:10.388 --> 06:41:10.398 align:start position:0%
bit on what type of call looking at yeah
 
06:41:13.910 --> 06:41:13.920 align:start position:0%
how do you check in on a animal that
 
06:41:18.030 --> 06:41:18.040 align:start position:0%
might be abused how do you get to go to
 
06:41:20.628 --> 06:41:20.638 align:start position:0%
that residence what is it that
 
06:41:24.468 --> 06:41:24.478 align:start position:0%
necessitates you getting a call in your
 
06:41:27.230 --> 06:41:27.240 align:start position:0%
official duties so that is an excellent
 
06:41:28.868 --> 06:41:28.878 align:start position:0%
question with a very broad answer I'm
 
06:41:31.150 --> 06:41:31.160 align:start position:0%
going to try to to shorten it as best I
 
06:41:33.310 --> 06:41:33.320 align:start position:0%
can there are a thousand different ways
 
06:41:35.230 --> 06:41:35.240 align:start position:0%
that call can happen I can get a call
 
06:41:37.948 --> 06:41:37.958 align:start position:0%
from the sheriff's department and
 
06:41:39.990 --> 06:41:40.000 align:start position:0%
Michaela who covers Salem could call me
 
06:41:41.270 --> 06:41:41.280 align:start position:0%
up and say she might have seen something
 
06:41:43.310 --> 06:41:43.320 align:start position:0%
kind of sketchy at a home but that
 
06:41:45.150 --> 06:41:45.160 align:start position:0%
doesn't allow me to the entry to that
 
06:41:48.670 --> 06:41:48.680 align:start position:0%
home so for me to finally get entry to
 
06:41:50.948 --> 06:41:50.958 align:start position:0%
see if neglect is happening I have to
 
06:41:52.590 --> 06:41:52.600 align:start position:0%
have a search warrant in order to get a
 
06:41:54.910 --> 06:41:54.920 align:start position:0%
search warrant I have up to year two
 
06:41:56.628 --> 06:41:56.638 align:start position:0%
years worth of Investigation to do so by
 
06:41:58.468 --> 06:41:58.478 align:start position:0%
the time I even get in there to see if
 
06:42:01.030 --> 06:42:01.040 align:start position:0%
the animals neglected there's been a ton
 
06:42:03.230 --> 06:42:03.240 align:start position:0%
of back work done I then have to bring
 
06:42:06.030 --> 06:42:06.040 align:start position:0%
it to court for that I need my executed
 
06:42:07.670 --> 06:42:07.680 align:start position:0%
search warrant to bring a ton of
 
06:42:09.948 --> 06:42:09.958 align:start position:0%
information to light that I can use as
 
06:42:12.670 --> 06:42:12.680 align:start position:0%
justification to my prosecutor as to why
 
06:42:14.388 --> 06:42:14.398 align:start position:0%
we're going to bring that to court once
 
06:42:16.230 --> 06:42:16.240 align:start position:0%
it's to court I have to convince a judge
 
06:42:18.030 --> 06:42:18.040 align:start position:0%
who may or may not have any knowledge of
 
06:42:20.070 --> 06:42:20.080 align:start position:0%
Animal Care cruelty or the statutes at
 
06:42:22.548 --> 06:42:22.558 align:start position:0%
all whatsoever that this is important
 
06:42:24.548 --> 06:42:24.558 align:start position:0%
and this person needs to be convicted
 
06:42:27.670 --> 06:42:27.680 align:start position:0%
so it's not just a matter of I forgot to
 
06:42:29.628 --> 06:42:29.638 align:start position:0%
feed my dog for a couple days it's a
 
06:42:33.110 --> 06:42:33.120 align:start position:0%
matter of I worked up to five years to
 
06:42:35.948 --> 06:42:35.958 align:start position:0%
get into this home to help this Animal
 
06:42:37.110 --> 06:42:37.120 align:start position:0%
by the time they're
 
06:42:38.990 --> 06:42:39.000 align:start position:0%
convicted their name needs to be
 
06:42:40.430 --> 06:42:40.440 align:start position:0%
somewhere so that I can find out or
 
06:42:42.628 --> 06:42:42.638 align:start position:0%
other acos can find out what happened
 
06:42:44.110 --> 06:42:44.120 align:start position:0%
and how that should be treated moving
 
06:42:47.430 --> 06:42:47.440 align:start position:0%
forward thank you represent ktoa thank
 
06:42:50.868 --> 06:42:50.878 align:start position:0%
you madam chair and thank you again um
 
06:42:53.750 --> 06:42:53.760 align:start position:0%
now it is my understanding uh you're an
 
06:42:55.830 --> 06:42:55.840 align:start position:0%
Animal control officer but if the
 
06:42:57.830 --> 06:42:57.840 align:start position:0%
sheriff decided that he wanted to get
 
06:43:01.110 --> 06:43:01.120 align:start position:0%
into that home or a police officer they
 
06:43:02.270 --> 06:43:02.280 align:start position:0%
would be able to get in there more
 
06:43:04.628 --> 06:43:04.638 align:start position:0%
readily because they have the
 
06:43:06.388 --> 06:43:06.398 align:start position:0%
enforcement behind them whereas you
 
06:43:08.948 --> 06:43:08.958 align:start position:0%
don't is that correct uh that is
 
06:43:10.868 --> 06:43:10.878 align:start position:0%
incorrect I work for the Salem New
 
06:43:13.070 --> 06:43:13.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Police Department I am very
 
06:43:14.788 --> 06:43:14.798 align:start position:0%
grateful to find that I have the backing
 
06:43:17.468 --> 06:43:17.478 align:start position:0%
of a number of fine individuals there so
 
06:43:20.150 --> 06:43:20.160 align:start position:0%
when I find information out I'm able to
 
06:43:21.868 --> 06:43:21.878 align:start position:0%
then transfer that information to a
 
06:43:24.110 --> 06:43:24.120 align:start position:0%
patrol officer who signs off off on my
 
06:43:25.948 --> 06:43:25.958 align:start position:0%
search warrant well didn't sign off they
 
06:43:27.590 --> 06:43:27.600 align:start position:0%
sign off on my warrant affidavit which
 
06:43:30.788 --> 06:43:30.798 align:start position:0%
then goes to get signed off by JP so
 
06:43:32.548 --> 06:43:32.558 align:start position:0%
they would follow the same steps that I
 
06:43:34.310 --> 06:43:34.320 align:start position:0%
do the only difference being that I go
 
06:43:36.430 --> 06:43:36.440 align:start position:0%
to a patrol officer first with my Warren
 
06:43:38.070 --> 06:43:38.080 align:start position:0%
affidavit and tell them what happened
 
06:43:39.230 --> 06:43:39.240 align:start position:0%
and they sign off on it and then they
 
06:43:41.430 --> 06:43:41.440 align:start position:0%
follow the same steps if it were them
 
06:43:42.750 --> 06:43:42.760 align:start position:0%
they would grab the warrant affidavit
 
06:43:44.110 --> 06:43:44.120 align:start position:0%
and follow the same steps without having
 
06:43:47.310 --> 06:43:47.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:43:49.590 --> 06:43:49.600 align:start position:0%
signature any other
 
06:43:51.910 --> 06:43:51.920 align:start position:0%
questions thank you for coming and
 
06:43:54.830 --> 06:43:54.840 align:start position:0%
speaking today thank you appreciate it
 
06:44:07.788 --> 06:44:07.798 align:start position:0%

06:44:42.430 --> 06:44:42.440 align:start position:0%
because every time I see this bill come
 
06:44:46.548 --> 06:44:46.558 align:start position:0%
up I find I like it less and less and
 
06:44:50.030 --> 06:44:50.040 align:start position:0%
that has to do with in part you know of
 
06:44:51.990 --> 06:44:52.000 align:start position:0%
course life experience the more you have
 
06:44:53.948 --> 06:44:53.958 align:start position:0%
the more you're apt to find something
 
06:44:59.788 --> 06:44:59.798 align:start position:0%
that you you uh get Consolidated on um I
 
06:45:01.830 --> 06:45:01.840 align:start position:0%
have a big background in animals I've
 
06:45:03.990 --> 06:45:04.000 align:start position:0%
done rescue I've been a breeder I've
 
06:45:05.868 --> 06:45:05.878 align:start position:0%
done showing and training and behavior
 
06:45:08.788 --> 06:45:08.798 align:start position:0%
modification and so I and I own both
 
06:45:11.868 --> 06:45:11.878 align:start position:0%
dogs and cats um I was an online pet
 
06:45:13.548 --> 06:45:13.558 align:start position:0%
expert for six years so now you got an
 
06:45:15.230 --> 06:45:15.240 align:start position:0%
idea that I at least might know
 
06:45:17.910 --> 06:45:17.920 align:start position:0%
something um because I'm interested in
 
06:45:19.868 --> 06:45:19.878 align:start position:0%
animals I follow the local animals for
 
06:45:19.878 --> 06:45:20.910 align:start position:0%
animals I follow the local animals for
sale

06:45:20.910 --> 06:45:20.920 align:start position:0%
sale
 
06:45:23.230 --> 06:45:23.240 align:start position:0%
advertising um the rescue and adoption
 
06:45:25.510 --> 06:45:25.520 align:start position:0%
that Network information and of course
 
06:45:29.830 --> 06:45:29.840 align:start position:0%
animal news um yeah while I've always
 
06:45:31.750 --> 06:45:31.760 align:start position:0%
carefully screened new homes for pet
 
06:45:34.388 --> 06:45:34.398 align:start position:0%
pets that I might place with them that
 
06:45:37.030 --> 06:45:37.040 align:start position:0%
doesn't always happen I'm speaking in
 
06:45:40.270 --> 06:45:40.280 align:start position:0%
opposition because among other things
 
06:45:43.150 --> 06:45:43.160 align:start position:0%
the internet is a dangerous
 
06:45:45.830 --> 06:45:45.840 align:start position:0%
place unlike the laws for registering
 
06:45:47.590 --> 06:45:47.600 align:start position:0%
sex offenders where the intent is to
 
06:45:49.910 --> 06:45:49.920 align:start position:0%
protect the community at large by making
 
06:45:52.230 --> 06:45:52.240 align:start position:0%
information available for informed
 
06:45:54.468 --> 06:45:54.478 align:start position:0%
decision making by parents to help their
 
06:45:57.030 --> 06:45:57.040 align:start position:0%
children avoid stranger danger the
 
06:45:59.350 --> 06:45:59.360 align:start position:0%
animal abuse registry Bill serves no
 
06:46:00.948 --> 06:46:00.958 align:start position:0%
particular purpose for protecting
 
06:46:03.310 --> 06:46:03.320 align:start position:0%
members of the public instead it seems
 
06:46:05.708 --> 06:46:05.718 align:start position:0%
to fly in the face of our perception of
 
06:46:07.548 --> 06:46:07.558 align:start position:0%
the justice system that one can pay
 
06:46:10.230 --> 06:46:10.240 align:start position:0%
one's debt to society and move on with
 
06:46:13.070 --> 06:46:13.080 align:start position:0%
life from what I can see of the average
 
06:46:17.708 --> 06:46:17.718 align:start position:0%
pet owner who is placing a litter an
 
06:46:19.788 --> 06:46:19.798 align:start position:0%
individual animal the dog they inherited
 
06:46:22.430 --> 06:46:22.440 align:start position:0%
from their mother-in-law whatever they
 
06:46:24.590 --> 06:46:24.600 align:start position:0%
don't do health certificates which are
 
06:46:28.430 --> 06:46:28.440 align:start position:0%
required by law they don't do even
 
06:46:30.750 --> 06:46:30.760 align:start position:0%
minimal checking of a person other than
 
06:46:34.190 --> 06:46:34.200 align:start position:0%
if they've got money um I can't see any
 
06:46:39.510 --> 06:46:39.520 align:start position:0%
of them using a database like this um
 
06:46:42.310 --> 06:46:42.320 align:start position:0%
and that's just you know people don't do
 
06:46:44.670 --> 06:46:44.680 align:start position:0%
it if work is involved I put a couple
 
06:46:47.708 --> 06:46:47.718 align:start position:0%
examples at the end of my testimony um
 
06:46:49.990 --> 06:46:50.000 align:start position:0%
of people who are looking for animals
 
06:46:51.910 --> 06:46:51.920 align:start position:0%
that they placed wondering what happened
 
06:46:54.030 --> 06:46:54.040 align:start position:0%
because they lost their phone they lost
 
06:46:55.750 --> 06:46:55.760 align:start position:0%
their contact with the person that they
 
06:46:58.310 --> 06:46:58.320 align:start position:0%
placed the animal with um that that
 
06:46:59.948 --> 06:46:59.958 align:start position:0%
happens all the time I just put a couple
 
06:47:04.868 --> 06:47:04.878 align:start position:0%
in so you can see it um
 
06:47:08.510 --> 06:47:08.520 align:start position:0%
and for me the bill really seems to
 
06:47:11.548 --> 06:47:11.558 align:start position:0%
promote cyber bullying rather than the
 
06:47:14.150 --> 06:47:14.160 align:start position:0%
reduction of incidents of animal
 
06:47:18.590 --> 06:47:18.600 align:start position:0%
abuse um people are quirky they look out
 
06:47:21.750 --> 06:47:21.760 align:start position:0%
there they look at um animal abuse
 
06:47:24.030 --> 06:47:24.040 align:start position:0%
offenders and think that they are evil
 
06:47:26.350 --> 06:47:26.360 align:start position:0%
horrible nasty people when maybe they're
 
06:47:29.230 --> 06:47:29.240 align:start position:0%
just a little old lady who was a had
 
06:47:31.430 --> 06:47:31.440 align:start position:0%
become a hoarder and could really do
 
06:47:33.468 --> 06:47:33.478 align:start position:0%
with a lot more social interaction to
 
06:47:34.830 --> 06:47:34.840 align:start position:0%
change that
 
06:47:37.910 --> 06:47:37.920 align:start position:0%
behavior um the bill as it stands as you
 
06:47:39.270 --> 06:47:39.280 align:start position:0%
pointed out earlier makes even
 
06:47:41.708 --> 06:47:41.718 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor animal cruelty uh a
 
06:47:44.788 --> 06:47:44.798 align:start position:0%
long-term sentence to public scrutiny um
 
06:47:46.350 --> 06:47:46.360 align:start position:0%
ridicule and
 
06:47:48.708 --> 06:47:48.718 align:start position:0%
censure horrible things can happen to
 
06:47:50.948 --> 06:47:50.958 align:start position:0%
people who are on a list like this um
 
06:47:53.868 --> 06:47:53.878 align:start position:0%
there's a um
 
06:47:55.670 --> 06:47:55.680 align:start position:0%
I put a link in the bottom of this that
 
06:47:57.388 --> 06:47:57.398 align:start position:0%
hopefully you'll get the online version
 
06:47:59.310 --> 06:47:59.320 align:start position:0%
where you where there was a story up in
 
06:48:01.590 --> 06:48:01.600 align:start position:0%
recent story up in Canada of what
 
06:48:03.628 --> 06:48:03.638 align:start position:0%
happened to somebody who was accused of
 
06:48:06.628 --> 06:48:06.638 align:start position:0%
animal cruelty it was all a fake thing
 
06:48:09.350 --> 06:48:09.360 align:start position:0%
with somebody trying to get back at them
 
06:48:11.670 --> 06:48:11.680 align:start position:0%
and this person was really maligned all
 
06:48:13.230 --> 06:48:13.240 align:start position:0%
over the Internet so it's it's the kind
 
06:48:15.670 --> 06:48:15.680 align:start position:0%
of thing where this can happen to people
 
06:48:17.270 --> 06:48:17.280 align:start position:0%
um even if they have been convicted of
 
06:48:19.430 --> 06:48:19.440 align:start position:0%
animal cruelty they were animal cruelty
 
06:48:22.830 --> 06:48:22.840 align:start position:0%
will this help them get past it what
 
06:48:25.310 --> 06:48:25.320 align:start position:0%
does this this do to help stop this from
 
06:48:27.750 --> 06:48:27.760 align:start position:0%
happening again I don't see anything
 
06:48:30.948 --> 06:48:30.958 align:start position:0%
that it does um you know the thing that
 
06:48:32.830 --> 06:48:32.840 align:start position:0%
I do see is
 
06:48:36.670 --> 06:48:36.680 align:start position:0%
that we could use some money put into
 
06:48:38.990 --> 06:48:39.000 align:start position:0%
intervention to maybe monitor those
 
06:48:40.948 --> 06:48:40.958 align:start position:0%
people who are convicted to make sure
 
06:48:42.590 --> 06:48:42.600 align:start position:0%
that they are abiding by whatever the
 
06:48:45.830 --> 06:48:45.840 align:start position:0%
court has said that somebody accused of
 
06:48:48.190 --> 06:48:48.200 align:start position:0%
hoarding and convicted of hoarding could
 
06:48:51.190 --> 06:48:51.200 align:start position:0%
get the mental health uh that they need
 
06:48:53.590 --> 06:48:53.600 align:start position:0%
um I know some people with a situation
 
06:48:56.030 --> 06:48:56.040 align:start position:0%
where the the particular like livestock
 
06:48:58.548 --> 06:48:58.558 align:start position:0%
where it's gone to animal cruelty the
 
06:49:01.150 --> 06:49:01.160 align:start position:0%
people just had no money they had no
 
06:49:02.310 --> 06:49:02.320 align:start position:0%
couldn't figure out what to do with the
 
06:49:04.868 --> 06:49:04.878 align:start position:0%
animals they had no money to feed them
 
06:49:08.868 --> 06:49:08.878 align:start position:0%
okay um so I just can't see the people
 
06:49:11.350 --> 06:49:11.360 align:start position:0%
who have been in a bad situation or have
 
06:49:13.670 --> 06:49:13.680 align:start position:0%
a mental health issue or whatever I
 
06:49:15.868 --> 06:49:15.878 align:start position:0%
can't see them put out there to be a
 
06:49:18.030 --> 06:49:18.040 align:start position:0%
target for anybody who decides they want
 
06:49:21.830 --> 06:49:21.840 align:start position:0%
to handle them um you know I think you
 
06:49:23.670 --> 06:49:23.680 align:start position:0%
know just making sure like somebody like
 
06:49:26.110 --> 06:49:26.120 align:start position:0%
aorta gets the social services they need
 
06:49:29.230 --> 06:49:29.240 align:start position:0%
somebody with an anger issue gets the um
 
06:49:31.948 --> 06:49:31.958 align:start position:0%
Anger Management training they need and
 
06:49:33.750 --> 06:49:33.760 align:start position:0%
I suppose you know with this bill it
 
06:49:36.150 --> 06:49:36.160 align:start position:0%
depends on your goals whether you feel
 
06:49:38.628 --> 06:49:38.638 align:start position:0%
that public shaming or help with
 
06:49:40.590 --> 06:49:40.600 align:start position:0%
Rehabilitation is the best choice for
 
06:49:43.110 --> 06:49:43.120 align:start position:0%
working on this problem I personally
 
06:49:45.430 --> 06:49:45.440 align:start position:0%
think trying for rehabilitation and
 
06:49:48.510 --> 06:49:48.520 align:start position:0%
monitoring is a better deal um and I
 
06:49:50.430 --> 06:49:50.440 align:start position:0%
hope you find this bill in expedient to
 
06:49:52.788 --> 06:49:52.798 align:start position:0%
legislate just as it's happened every
 
06:49:54.830 --> 06:49:54.840 align:start position:0%
other the time it has come up that I've
 
06:50:00.070 --> 06:50:00.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:50:02.230 --> 06:50:02.240 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
06:50:04.350 --> 06:50:04.360 align:start position:0%
kulan thank you madam chair and thank
 
06:50:06.350 --> 06:50:06.360 align:start position:0%
you for your testimony today I just had
 
06:50:08.230 --> 06:50:08.240 align:start position:0%
one question for you it's do you think
 
06:50:10.430 --> 06:50:10.440 align:start position:0%
that a program or registry like this
 
06:50:13.468 --> 06:50:13.478 align:start position:0%
could have the potential to be
 
06:50:16.468 --> 06:50:16.478 align:start position:0%
weaponized against people that might not
 
06:50:20.030 --> 06:50:20.040 align:start position:0%
be guilty of animal cruelty well as
 
06:50:22.590 --> 06:50:22.600 align:start position:0%
hopefully the people who would be onor
 
06:50:24.590 --> 06:50:24.600 align:start position:0%
are only people who have been judged
 
06:50:27.510 --> 06:50:27.520 align:start position:0%
Guilty by a court system I would say yes
 
06:50:29.388 --> 06:50:29.398 align:start position:0%
it has a strong potential to be
 
06:50:31.388 --> 06:50:31.398 align:start position:0%
weaponized against people whose
 
06:50:34.468 --> 06:50:34.478 align:start position:0%
circumstances we don't know we don't
 
06:50:36.868 --> 06:50:36.878 align:start position:0%
know why they ended up getting convicted
 
06:50:38.548 --> 06:50:38.558 align:start position:0%
we don't know what has happened in their
 
06:50:40.230 --> 06:50:40.240 align:start position:0%
lives we don't know if anything could be
 
06:50:42.270 --> 06:50:42.280 align:start position:0%
changed to make it different for them
 
06:50:44.868 --> 06:50:44.878 align:start position:0%
but I absolutely believe that putting
 
06:50:46.430 --> 06:50:46.440 align:start position:0%
people on a registry like this and
 
06:50:50.430 --> 06:50:50.440 align:start position:0%
having it open to everybody to view is
 
06:50:53.030 --> 06:50:53.040 align:start position:0%
putting a Target on those people's backs
 
06:50:55.110 --> 06:50:55.120 align:start position:0%
and I for one would find it really hard
 
06:50:56.590 --> 06:50:56.600 align:start position:0%
to find that somebody's house had been
 
06:50:58.070 --> 06:50:58.080 align:start position:0%
burned down or their kids have been
 
06:51:00.030 --> 06:51:00.040 align:start position:0%
attacked or whatever because they had
 
06:51:01.830 --> 06:51:01.840 align:start position:0%
this conviction if you really are
 
06:51:03.430 --> 06:51:03.440 align:start position:0%
worried about what other people have
 
06:51:06.070 --> 06:51:06.080 align:start position:0%
been doing you probably should open up
 
06:51:07.388 --> 06:51:07.398 align:start position:0%
let me see if I can find the correct
 
06:51:12.190 --> 06:51:12.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:51:15.030 --> 06:51:15.040 align:start position:0%
the it's the New Hampshire criminals
 
06:51:17.350 --> 06:51:17.360 align:start position:0%
records unit maintains information on
 
06:51:19.430 --> 06:51:19.440 align:start position:0%
offenders and if you're really worried
 
06:51:21.468 --> 06:51:21.478 align:start position:0%
about what everybody else is doing and
 
06:51:23.388 --> 06:51:23.398 align:start position:0%
that everybody should know about it then
 
06:51:26.548 --> 06:51:26.558 align:start position:0%
maybe we should just open up that which
 
06:51:28.590 --> 06:51:28.600 align:start position:0%
is already in place and say okay you can
 
06:51:30.628 --> 06:51:30.638 align:start position:0%
look up anybody and find out if they've
 
06:51:32.910 --> 06:51:32.920 align:start position:0%
ever done a crime you know been a drunk
 
06:51:34.230 --> 06:51:34.240 align:start position:0%
driver hey your neighbors are going to
 
06:51:36.868 --> 06:51:36.878 align:start position:0%
know I I don't I don't see that as being
 
06:51:38.070 --> 06:51:38.080 align:start position:0%
any different than what you're saying
 
06:51:40.110 --> 06:51:40.120 align:start position:0%
for the for the animal abuse I really
 
06:51:43.910 --> 06:51:43.920 align:start position:0%
believe that this is a a way to down the
 
06:51:45.830 --> 06:51:45.840 align:start position:0%
road see terrible things happen to
 
06:51:47.510 --> 06:51:47.520 align:start position:0%
people who whether or not they deserve
 
06:51:49.708 --> 06:51:49.718 align:start position:0%
it shouldn't have it happen to
 
06:51:53.070 --> 06:51:53.080 align:start position:0%
them representative German thank you M
 
06:51:54.670 --> 06:51:54.680 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you very much for taking
 
06:51:57.350 --> 06:51:57.360 align:start position:0%
my question uh I think there are
 
06:52:00.270 --> 06:52:00.280 align:start position:0%
definitely uh some good arguments to be
 
06:52:02.628 --> 06:52:02.638 align:start position:0%
made as to why it's not ideal to have
 
06:52:05.430 --> 06:52:05.440 align:start position:0%
this just an open you know I think
 
06:52:07.150 --> 06:52:07.160 align:start position:0%
perhaps the comparison with the sex
 
06:52:09.468 --> 06:52:09.478 align:start position:0%
offender registry is getting us off in a
 
06:52:12.110 --> 06:52:12.120 align:start position:0%
direction we shouldn't be going in but C
 
06:52:13.990 --> 06:52:14.000 align:start position:0%
can you
 
06:52:17.070 --> 06:52:17.080 align:start position:0%
envision a a tool for law enforcemen
 
06:52:19.948 --> 06:52:19.958 align:start position:0%
like officer O'Brien that would help
 
06:52:22.350 --> 06:52:22.360 align:start position:0%
them do their work something which is
 
06:52:24.788 --> 06:52:24.798 align:start position:0%
not as is outward facing because it does
 
06:52:27.190 --> 06:52:27.200 align:start position:0%
seem to me again based on the officer's
 
06:52:30.310 --> 06:52:30.320 align:start position:0%
testimony that often we're talking about
 
06:52:32.910 --> 06:52:32.920 align:start position:0%
people who are are known to local law
 
06:52:35.150 --> 06:52:35.160 align:start position:0%
enforcement and who have had you know a
 
06:52:36.788 --> 06:52:36.798 align:start position:0%
number of incidents and that that's
 
06:52:38.548 --> 06:52:38.558 align:start position:0%
important for officers to have when
 
06:52:39.868 --> 06:52:39.878 align:start position:0%
they're investigating so could you see
 
06:52:41.948 --> 06:52:41.958 align:start position:0%
the usefulness of a tool which is
 
06:52:44.230 --> 06:52:44.240 align:start position:0%
specific to law enforcement well they've
 
06:52:47.830 --> 06:52:47.840 align:start position:0%
got one they've got a um a Crim a
 
06:52:49.830 --> 06:52:49.840 align:start position:0%
criminal I'm sorry I can't remember that
 
06:52:52.350 --> 06:52:52.360 align:start position:0%
darn name the criminal records unit and
 
06:52:54.070 --> 06:52:54.080 align:start position:0%
you can access that you have to pay a
 
06:52:56.510 --> 06:52:56.520 align:start position:0%
fee to access it if you're not a law
 
06:52:58.510 --> 06:52:58.520 align:start position:0%
enforcement member but I believe a law
 
06:53:00.388 --> 06:53:00.398 align:start position:0%
enforcement member can access it to look
 
06:53:03.110 --> 06:53:03.120 align:start position:0%
somebody up to see what their what their
 
06:53:06.990 --> 06:53:07.000 align:start position:0%
record is um now whether that's open to
 
06:53:09.990 --> 06:53:10.000 align:start position:0%
civilian Animal Control offices I do not
 
06:53:14.788 --> 06:53:14.798 align:start position:0%
know um but this this is the thing um
 
06:53:18.310 --> 06:53:18.320 align:start position:0%
you know I I just can't see number one
 
06:53:19.948 --> 06:53:19.958 align:start position:0%
the numbers on this database are
 
06:53:23.788 --> 06:53:23.798 align:start position:0%
probably low number two as was St ated
 
06:53:25.590 --> 06:53:25.600 align:start position:0%
the people who the courts have been
 
06:53:28.388 --> 06:53:28.398 align:start position:0%
lenient with and say okay we're going to
 
06:53:32.230 --> 06:53:32.240 align:start position:0%
defer these charges as long as you go
 
06:53:34.150 --> 06:53:34.160 align:start position:0%
five years without having any more
 
06:53:36.670 --> 06:53:36.680 align:start position:0%
charges brought those won't be on a
 
06:53:38.788 --> 06:53:38.798 align:start position:0%
database anywhere the the charges are
 
06:53:40.708 --> 06:53:40.718 align:start position:0%
deferred and those are the people that
 
06:53:42.388 --> 06:53:42.398 align:start position:0%
you would probably want to be keeping
 
06:53:46.388 --> 06:53:46.398 align:start position:0%
track of um so it just I don't see any
 
06:53:50.468 --> 06:53:50.478 align:start position:0%
real utility to this and in my
 
06:53:53.070 --> 06:53:53.080 align:start position:0%
experience the animal shelters keep a
 
06:53:55.788 --> 06:53:55.798 align:start position:0%
list of people they don't adopt
 
06:53:59.990 --> 06:54:00.000 align:start position:0%
to um I can't say it's still happening I
 
06:54:02.070 --> 06:54:02.080 align:start position:0%
can't still say it's still always that
 
06:54:04.868 --> 06:54:04.878 align:start position:0%
way and that every shelter has it but I
 
06:54:07.590 --> 06:54:07.600 align:start position:0%
know that the shelters have been keeping
 
06:54:10.830 --> 06:54:10.840 align:start position:0%
individual lists of no no adoption
 
06:54:14.190 --> 06:54:14.200 align:start position:0%
to okay thank you sure any other
 
06:54:17.670 --> 06:54:17.680 align:start position:0%
questions thank you oh representative D
 
06:54:20.270 --> 06:54:20.280 align:start position:0%
just want to make um you you know you
 
06:54:23.110 --> 06:54:23.120 align:start position:0%
made a comment that this could be uh
 
06:54:26.150 --> 06:54:26.160 align:start position:0%
cyber bullying but you know I haven't
 
06:54:27.548 --> 06:54:27.558 align:start position:0%
seen it in a long time because I don't
 
06:54:29.030 --> 06:54:29.040 align:start position:0%
think they do it in the newspapers they
 
06:54:31.388 --> 06:54:31.398 align:start position:0%
probably do it online but you know in
 
06:54:33.788 --> 06:54:33.798 align:start position:0%
the newspapers there always used to be a
 
06:54:36.270 --> 06:54:36.280 align:start position:0%
police report and who was picked up on
 
06:54:39.670 --> 06:54:39.680 align:start position:0%
DWI and who was picked up on you know
 
06:54:42.990 --> 06:54:43.000 align:start position:0%
some sex offense and everything so so
 
06:54:45.510 --> 06:54:45.520 align:start position:0%
this is nothing new this has always been
 
06:54:47.788 --> 06:54:47.798 align:start position:0%
it's always been public information it
 
06:54:49.190 --> 06:54:49.200 align:start position:0%
it's not that it's not public
 
06:54:52.150 --> 06:54:52.160 align:start position:0%
information it's the reach whereas
 
06:54:53.830 --> 06:54:53.840 align:start position:0%
before you maybe only saw that
 
06:54:55.150 --> 06:54:55.160 align:start position:0%
information if you read your local
 
06:54:57.548 --> 06:54:57.558 align:start position:0%
newspaper or read your local police logs
 
06:55:00.310 --> 06:55:00.320 align:start position:0%
and not everybody seems to publish those
 
06:55:03.910 --> 06:55:03.920 align:start position:0%
but now anybody somebody in Minnesota
 
06:55:06.150 --> 06:55:06.160 align:start position:0%
can decide that this person here abused
 
06:55:08.430 --> 06:55:08.440 align:start position:0%
a Husky and therefore they are going to
 
06:55:10.230 --> 06:55:10.240 align:start position:0%
come and kill them for that because they
 
06:55:13.430 --> 06:55:13.440 align:start position:0%
like huskys you just don't know it's
 
06:55:15.628 --> 06:55:15.638 align:start position:0%
it's the reach you know it's one thing
 
06:55:18.150 --> 06:55:18.160 align:start position:0%
for your neighbors to find out and shun
 
06:55:20.030 --> 06:55:20.040 align:start position:0%
you and give you a hard time it's
 
06:55:22.910 --> 06:55:22.920 align:start position:0%
another thing that you cannot control
 
06:55:25.510 --> 06:55:25.520 align:start position:0%
who was viewing this information and
 
06:55:28.270 --> 06:55:28.280 align:start position:0%
what they decide to do about it and I
 
06:55:33.590 --> 06:55:33.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:55:35.948 --> 06:55:35.958 align:start position:0%
situation any other
 
06:55:38.190 --> 06:55:38.200 align:start position:0%
questions thank you for your testimony
 
06:55:43.830 --> 06:55:43.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:55:43.840 --> 06:55:45.910 align:start position:0%
 
me

06:55:45.910 --> 06:55:45.920 align:start position:0%
me
 
06:55:50.948 --> 06:55:50.958 align:start position:0%
I'm next call Kurt aronberg to
 
06:55:53.548 --> 06:55:53.558 align:start position:0%
speak I could speak
 
06:55:55.830 --> 06:55:55.840 align:start position:0%
got yeah I'll get out of your way one
 
06:55:57.510 --> 06:55:57.520 align:start position:0%
second one second
 
06:56:00.990 --> 06:56:01.000 align:start position:0%
take no everyone my my only choice is
 
06:56:07.270 --> 06:56:07.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:56:09.830 --> 06:56:09.840 align:start position:0%
with I'm still Kurt aronburg from the
 
06:56:11.948 --> 06:56:11.958 align:start position:0%
Humane Society of the United States and
 
06:56:14.788 --> 06:56:14.798 align:start position:0%
I'll be brief
 
06:56:18.230 --> 06:56:18.240 align:start position:0%
um you know I I do think that the uh the
 
06:56:20.830 --> 06:56:20.840 align:start position:0%
great work that's done by the Animal
 
06:56:22.750 --> 06:56:22.760 align:start position:0%
Control Officers in this state there
 
06:56:24.468 --> 06:56:24.478 align:start position:0%
aren't enough of them that there's not
 
06:56:27.388 --> 06:56:27.398 align:start position:0%
enough support for them we need a better
 
06:56:29.990 --> 06:56:30.000 align:start position:0%
system in this state to make sure that
 
06:56:32.110 --> 06:56:32.120 align:start position:0%
when there is a cruelty case it's
 
06:56:34.590 --> 06:56:34.600 align:start position:0%
addressed and addressed by law
 
06:56:39.150 --> 06:56:39.160 align:start position:0%
enforcement swiftly I think this uh bill
 
06:56:42.430 --> 06:56:42.440 align:start position:0%
is a good bill it it establishes an a
 
06:56:47.310 --> 06:56:47.320 align:start position:0%
way for people like I'll say officer but
 
06:56:51.788 --> 06:56:51.798 align:start position:0%
is there a higher is an officer O'Brien
 
06:56:53.868 --> 06:56:53.878 align:start position:0%
yeah officer people like officer O'Brien
 
06:56:57.110 --> 06:56:57.120 align:start position:0%
to do their jobs uh have the tools they
 
06:57:02.788 --> 06:57:02.798 align:start position:0%
need to identify abusers in the state
 
06:57:06.430 --> 06:57:06.440 align:start position:0%
um so that would be my testimony and
 
06:57:09.590 --> 06:57:09.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:57:12.190 --> 06:57:12.200 align:start position:0%
this okay any
 
06:57:15.590 --> 06:57:15.600 align:start position:0%
questions thank you and uh my one last
 
06:57:21.388 --> 06:57:21.398 align:start position:0%
 
06:57:21.398 --> 06:57:26.070 align:start position:0%
 
fredman

06:57:26.070 --> 06:57:26.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:57:28.310 --> 06:57:28.320 align:start position:0%
uh Madame chair committee members Aubrey
 
06:57:30.190 --> 06:57:30.200 align:start position:0%
Friedman I live in Bridgewater private
 
06:57:33.750 --> 06:57:33.760 align:start position:0%
citizen I've owned dogs and cats um
 
06:57:36.510 --> 06:57:36.520 align:start position:0%
don't have any pets right now I speak in
 
06:57:39.750 --> 06:57:39.760 align:start position:0%
opposition to this bill
 
06:57:43.270 --> 06:57:43.280 align:start position:0%
um I did a little re my my first gut
 
06:57:45.788 --> 06:57:45.798 align:start position:0%
feeling when I saw this bill is I don't
 
06:57:47.510 --> 06:57:47.520 align:start position:0%
think this is a great idea but let's see
 
06:57:50.548 --> 06:57:50.558 align:start position:0%
what the research out there has to say
 
06:57:54.230 --> 06:57:54.240 align:start position:0%
and um I found actually the ASPCA who I
 
06:57:58.310 --> 06:57:58.320 align:start position:0%
got my last cat from and they actually
 
06:58:00.830 --> 06:58:00.840 align:start position:0%
came out against the animal uh
 
06:58:03.468 --> 06:58:03.478 align:start position:0%
Registries animal abuse Registries which
 
06:58:05.868 --> 06:58:05.878 align:start position:0%
I was kind of surprised cuz you would
 
06:58:08.468 --> 06:58:08.478 align:start position:0%
think they'd be for it and they had and
 
06:58:10.788 --> 06:58:10.798 align:start position:0%
I have back up here I S I only made one
 
06:58:12.708 --> 06:58:12.718 align:start position:0%
copy but when it comes around you can
 
06:58:15.190 --> 06:58:15.200 align:start position:0%
just take a picture of the link it has a
 
06:58:17.430 --> 06:58:17.440 align:start position:0%
great article about five or six pages
 
06:58:19.910 --> 06:58:19.920 align:start position:0%
and at lists about I don't know 10
 
06:58:22.830 --> 06:58:22.840 align:start position:0%
different reasons why they didn't think
 
06:58:25.388 --> 06:58:25.398 align:start position:0%
the animal regist animal abuse registry
 
06:58:27.910 --> 06:58:27.920 align:start position:0%
was a good idea um they said it was
 
06:58:27.920 --> 06:58:29.110 align:start position:0%
was a good idea um they said it was
well-meaning

06:58:29.110 --> 06:58:29.120 align:start position:0%
well-meaning
 
06:58:32.350 --> 06:58:32.360 align:start position:0%
but um it's not going to accomplish much
 
06:58:34.190 --> 06:58:34.200 align:start position:0%
actually and all the some of the things
 
06:58:35.468 --> 06:58:35.478 align:start position:0%
could actually be
 
06:58:37.310 --> 06:58:37.320 align:start position:0%
counterproductive I just picked out a
 
06:58:39.750 --> 06:58:39.760 align:start position:0%
couple now but as I say when it comes
 
06:58:42.030 --> 06:58:42.040 align:start position:0%
around just take a picture of the link
 
06:58:43.708 --> 06:58:43.718 align:start position:0%
and you can read the full article but I
 
06:58:45.788 --> 06:58:45.798 align:start position:0%
do have it attached here but just one
 
06:58:50.788 --> 06:58:50.798 align:start position:0%
copy so um they say things that could be
 
06:58:53.948 --> 06:58:53.958 align:start position:0%
done in the lawn right now now which are
 
06:58:56.990 --> 06:58:57.000 align:start position:0%
well- enforced no contact orders that
 
06:58:59.150 --> 06:58:59.160 align:start position:0%
would be one thing neither it's existing
 
06:59:01.910 --> 06:59:01.920 align:start position:0%
law these things that could help also
 
06:59:05.030 --> 06:59:05.040 align:start position:0%
mandated psychological assessment and
 
06:59:07.990 --> 06:59:08.000 align:start position:0%
also including pets in orders of
 
06:59:10.548 --> 06:59:10.558 align:start position:0%
protection usually it's a you know
 
06:59:12.708 --> 06:59:12.718 align:start position:0%
domestic abuse but so why not include
 
06:59:14.628 --> 06:59:14.638 align:start position:0%
pets too because if this is somebody who
 
06:59:17.468 --> 06:59:17.478 align:start position:0%
might beat his wife he might take it out
 
06:59:20.030 --> 06:59:20.040 align:start position:0%
on animals too so include pets in there
 
06:59:23.310 --> 06:59:23.320 align:start position:0%
so these are improvements things could
 
06:59:25.910 --> 06:59:25.920 align:start position:0%
help with the existing laws without
 
06:59:27.628 --> 06:59:27.638 align:start position:0%
taking on a new law that's not going to
 
06:59:30.388 --> 06:59:30.398 align:start position:0%
accomplish that much um also things that
 
06:59:33.150 --> 06:59:33.160 align:start position:0%
have been mentioned already
 
06:59:36.868 --> 06:59:36.878 align:start position:0%
um cities and towns have their own
 
06:59:41.230 --> 06:59:41.240 align:start position:0%
registry and counties excuse me but uh
 
06:59:43.350 --> 06:59:43.360 align:start position:0%
and in fact I looked at one it was at
 
06:59:46.230 --> 06:59:46.240 align:start position:0%
some city in Florida and it had about 10
 
06:59:48.510 --> 06:59:48.520 align:start position:0%
mug shots and they all look like
 
06:59:51.070 --> 06:59:51.080 align:start position:0%
criminals and scary people there were
 
06:59:54.430 --> 06:59:54.440 align:start position:0%
only about 10 on there and so it is a
 
06:59:56.468 --> 06:59:56.478 align:start position:0%
like as been mentioned it's a very
 
06:59:59.948 --> 06:59:59.958 align:start position:0%
limited number of names on it so it's
 
07:00:01.990 --> 07:00:02.000 align:start position:0%
not going to give you that much and
 
07:00:05.590 --> 07:00:05.600 align:start position:0%
again a person could be if you got your
 
07:00:07.788 --> 07:00:07.798 align:start position:0%
mug shot on it maybe you want to move
 
07:00:10.670 --> 07:00:10.680 align:start position:0%
out of state so the person in the next
 
07:00:13.110 --> 07:00:13.120 align:start position:0%
state might not have that so what good
 
07:00:14.310 --> 07:00:14.320 align:start position:0%
is it you're going to need the whole
 
07:00:17.628 --> 07:00:17.638 align:start position:0%
United States to really be useful so
 
07:00:18.990 --> 07:00:19.000 align:start position:0%
that's one thing there is they're
 
07:00:21.030 --> 07:00:21.040 align:start position:0%
they're limited and the number of names
 
07:00:24.070 --> 07:00:24.080 align:start position:0%
on them are limited too um also was
 
07:00:25.548 --> 07:00:25.558 align:start position:0%
mentioned in the
 
07:00:28.590 --> 07:00:28.600 align:start position:0%
article um so right now it's a felony
 
07:00:32.030 --> 07:00:32.040 align:start position:0%
you know that in the law and but plea
 
07:00:34.430 --> 07:00:34.440 align:start position:0%
bargaining is a big part of our system
 
07:00:36.750 --> 07:00:36.760 align:start position:0%
and in order to avoid getting your mug
 
07:00:39.788 --> 07:00:39.798 align:start position:0%
shot on a registry somebody might plead
 
07:00:42.190 --> 07:00:42.200 align:start position:0%
down to a misdemeanor instead of a
 
07:00:44.628 --> 07:00:44.638 align:start position:0%
felony and they miss out some of the
 
07:00:48.548 --> 07:00:48.558 align:start position:0%
things that go along with uh a felony
 
07:00:52.270 --> 07:00:52.280 align:start position:0%
like U long-term probation and
 
07:00:54.270 --> 07:00:54.280 align:start position:0%
psychological you know treatment that
 
07:00:56.190 --> 07:00:56.200 align:start position:0%
might actually help somebody who's got a
 
07:01:00.628 --> 07:01:00.638 align:start position:0%
problem so somebody who might get the
 
07:01:03.948 --> 07:01:03.958 align:start position:0%
treatment uh under the current law to
 
07:01:06.350 --> 07:01:06.360 align:start position:0%
avoid the registry might plead down and
 
07:01:08.430 --> 07:01:08.440 align:start position:0%
not get the treatment that they need so
 
07:01:10.788 --> 07:01:10.798 align:start position:0%
that's something to consider also cost
 
07:01:12.788 --> 07:01:12.798 align:start position:0%
I'm surprised there was no fiscal note
 
07:01:15.430 --> 07:01:15.440 align:start position:0%
mentioned in here but some of the like
 
07:01:17.150 --> 07:01:17.160 align:start position:0%
Virginia they said it's like a million
 
07:01:19.110 --> 07:01:19.120 align:start position:0%
dollar California was $2
 
07:01:22.708 --> 07:01:22.718 align:start position:0%
million so and as the one of somebody
 
07:01:24.948 --> 07:01:24.958 align:start position:0%
mentioned earlier there is definitely a
 
07:01:28.388 --> 07:01:28.398 align:start position:0%
cost to keeping up this kind of registry
 
07:01:31.548 --> 07:01:31.558 align:start position:0%
for a very small number of names they do
 
07:01:35.230 --> 07:01:35.240 align:start position:0%
actually charge the offenders fees to
 
07:01:37.150 --> 07:01:37.160 align:start position:0%
keep their names on the list it's you
 
07:01:39.910 --> 07:01:39.920 align:start position:0%
have to pay but the number of fees is so
 
07:01:41.910 --> 07:01:41.920 align:start position:0%
small there's no way it's going to cover
 
07:01:45.030 --> 07:01:45.040 align:start position:0%
it and it ends up being a t a a cost to
 
07:01:48.548 --> 07:01:48.558 align:start position:0%
the taxpayers to keep this up and uh
 
07:01:50.070 --> 07:01:50.080 align:start position:0%
let's see if there was anything else
 
07:01:53.150 --> 07:01:53.160 align:start position:0%
here um also most a lot of people are
 
07:01:57.070 --> 07:01:57.080 align:start position:0%
getting their animals not from like
 
07:02:00.788 --> 07:02:00.798 align:start position:0%
puppy mills you know uh uh
 
07:02:03.070 --> 07:02:03.080 align:start position:0%
shelters and or pet stores they're
 
07:02:05.388 --> 07:02:05.398 align:start position:0%
getting it from people they know so
 
07:02:07.990 --> 07:02:08.000 align:start position:0%
you're not actually going to be covering
 
07:02:09.868 --> 07:02:09.878 align:start position:0%
where a lot of people get their animals
 
07:02:11.868 --> 07:02:11.878 align:start position:0%
from and also by the way the bill only
 
07:02:15.030 --> 07:02:15.040 align:start position:0%
mentions dogs and cats what about
 
07:02:20.270 --> 07:02:20.280 align:start position:0%
livestock Birds there other uh you know
 
07:02:23.670 --> 07:02:23.680 align:start position:0%
uh Wildlife whatever you call it U that
 
07:02:25.990 --> 07:02:26.000 align:start position:0%
are could also be abused and that's not
 
07:02:28.788 --> 07:02:28.798 align:start position:0%
covered in the why is it just dogs and
 
07:02:31.830 --> 07:02:31.840 align:start position:0%
cats so you're missing a lot so all in
 
07:02:34.590 --> 07:02:34.600 align:start position:0%
all I just don't think this it's
 
07:02:36.310 --> 07:02:36.320 align:start position:0%
well-meaning but I don't think it would
 
07:02:39.590 --> 07:02:39.600 align:start position:0%
actually do much to to a cost to the
 
07:02:41.310 --> 07:02:41.320 align:start position:0%
taxpayers and might even be
 
07:02:43.868 --> 07:02:43.878 align:start position:0%
counterproductive as was mentioned some
 
07:02:46.788 --> 07:02:46.798 align:start position:0%
people might actually come after you uh
 
07:02:48.788 --> 07:02:48.798 align:start position:0%
if they see your you know mug shot in
 
07:02:50.990 --> 07:02:51.000 align:start position:0%
there so forth so I don't think it's a
 
07:02:53.310 --> 07:02:53.320 align:start position:0%
good bill and that's why oppose it thank
 
07:02:55.150 --> 07:02:55.160 align:start position:0%

07:02:57.270 --> 07:02:57.280 align:start position:0%
