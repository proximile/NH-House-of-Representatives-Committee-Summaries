time being um 11:31 I would like to uh
 
00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:37.240 align:start position:0%

establishing a state environmental
 
00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:46.720 align:start position:0%
adaptation resilience and Innovation
 
00:06:50.670 --> 00:06:50.680 align:start position:0%
Council uh with that I would like to
 
00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:53.440 align:start position:0%
recognize uh Senator Waters who Prime
 
00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:55.440 align:start position:0%
sponsor of the legislation and welcome
 
00:06:58.189 --> 00:06:58.199 align:start position:0%
you and all those here to public works
 
00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:00.360 align:start position:0%
thank you well thank you Mr chairman uh
 
00:07:01.909 --> 00:07:01.919 align:start position:0%
and members of the committee I'm Senator
 
00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:04.840 align:start position:0%
David Waters uh from District 4 and here
 
00:07:07.189 --> 00:07:07.199 align:start position:0%
to introduce Senate Bill 543 on the
 
00:07:09.230 --> 00:07:09.240 align:start position:0%
stated environmental adaptation
 
00:07:11.589 --> 00:07:11.599 align:start position:0%
resilience and Innovation Council and um
 
00:07:13.790 --> 00:07:13.800 align:start position:0%
as I start Mr chairman I did want to
 
00:07:15.990 --> 00:07:16.000 align:start position:0%
commend you all for the trific 10e plan
 
00:07:18.469 --> 00:07:18.479 align:start position:0%
you put together and um you know I
 
00:07:19.790 --> 00:07:19.800 align:start position:0%
really think it's great that this bill
 
00:07:21.550 --> 00:07:21.560 align:start position:0%
ended up with you all because you're a
 
00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:23.840 align:start position:0%
group that has you know deep wisdom on
 
00:07:26.510 --> 00:07:26.520 align:start position:0%
how we how we plan on a regional basis
 
00:07:29.029 --> 00:07:29.039 align:start position:0%
and uh how we make sure that taxpayer
 
00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:30.960 align:start position:0%
money is saved and when we look at our
 
00:07:32.629 --> 00:07:32.639 align:start position:0%
infrastructure across the across the
 
00:07:35.589 --> 00:07:35.599 align:start position:0%
state so what this bill uh intends to do
 
00:07:37.869 --> 00:07:37.879 align:start position:0%
is really to set up a a
 
00:07:40.510 --> 00:07:40.520 align:start position:0%
planning um Economic Development and
 
00:07:44.029 --> 00:07:44.039 align:start position:0%
risk avoidance uh Council and to look at
 
00:07:46.469 --> 00:07:46.479 align:start position:0%
as the first sentence here says you know
 
00:07:48.350 --> 00:07:48.360 align:start position:0%
given what's happening in New Hampshire
 
00:07:50.230 --> 00:07:50.240 align:start position:0%
with our environmental changes and
 
00:07:53.189 --> 00:07:53.199 align:start position:0%
storms and rainwater events and and so
 
00:07:55.629 --> 00:07:55.639 align:start position:0%
forth that uh the state needs to look at
 
00:07:58.790 --> 00:07:58.800 align:start position:0%
the kind of adaptation and uh Innovation
 
00:08:00.950 --> 00:08:00.960 align:start position:0%
leadership um that we can do to help
 
00:08:02.790 --> 00:08:02.800 align:start position:0%
residents communities particularly
 
00:08:06.189 --> 00:08:06.199 align:start position:0%
businesses uh to be able to thrive in in
 
00:08:10.070 --> 00:08:10.080 align:start position:0%
the future with with careful uh planning
 
00:08:12.070 --> 00:08:12.080 align:start position:0%
um this is all about trying to save
 
00:08:14.189 --> 00:08:14.199 align:start position:0%
taxpayer dollars in the future and it's
 
00:08:15.950 --> 00:08:15.960 align:start position:0%
also about the importance of a planning
 
00:08:18.110 --> 00:08:18.120 align:start position:0%
across agencies I will talk in a moment
 
00:08:19.990 --> 00:08:20.000 align:start position:0%
about a lot of the good planning that
 
00:08:22.029 --> 00:08:22.039 align:start position:0%
has been done kind of siloed off a
 
00:08:23.189 --> 00:08:23.199 align:start position:0%
little bit and this would be an
 
00:08:24.830 --> 00:08:24.840 align:start position:0%
opportunity for the agencies that are
 
00:08:26.950 --> 00:08:26.960 align:start position:0%
listed on the council to come together
 
00:08:29.670 --> 00:08:29.680 align:start position:0%
and to work together as other folks
 
00:08:32.709 --> 00:08:32.719 align:start position:0%
doing in other other states um you know
 
00:08:35.269 --> 00:08:35.279 align:start position:0%
it really is about comprehensive uh
 
00:08:37.509 --> 00:08:37.519 align:start position:0%
contens of planning uh particularly
 
00:08:40.029 --> 00:08:40.039 align:start position:0%
related to State infrastructure um I
 
00:08:42.589 --> 00:08:42.599 align:start position:0%
want to thank uh so many people who have
 
00:08:44.910 --> 00:08:44.920 align:start position:0%
helped with this um you know
 
00:08:46.870 --> 00:08:46.880 align:start position:0%
particularly Health and Human Services
 
00:08:49.030 --> 00:08:49.040 align:start position:0%
particularly Bob Scott commissioner
 
00:08:52.070 --> 00:08:52.080 align:start position:0%
Scott um a lot of good help from uh
 
00:08:54.750 --> 00:08:54.760 align:start position:0%
Homeland Security um Department of
 
00:08:56.710 --> 00:08:56.720 align:start position:0%
Agriculture U fishing gameing you know
 
00:08:58.150 --> 00:08:58.160 align:start position:0%
everybody listed here a lot of
 
00:09:00.470 --> 00:09:00.480 align:start position:0%
conversations with about you know the
 
00:09:02.230 --> 00:09:02.240 align:start position:0%
common sense of having them work
 
00:09:04.150 --> 00:09:04.160 align:start position:0%
together on on planning and you will see
 
00:09:06.069 --> 00:09:06.079 align:start position:0%
embedded in the bill many of the
 
00:09:07.750 --> 00:09:07.760 align:start position:0%
suggestions that they made and and some
 
00:09:09.670 --> 00:09:09.680 align:start position:0%
of the language too from these various
 
00:09:12.350 --> 00:09:12.360 align:start position:0%
uh various departments
 
00:09:15.710 --> 00:09:15.720 align:start position:0%
um and uh really the the the strategy
 
00:09:19.150 --> 00:09:19.160 align:start position:0%
here is to to bring people uh together
 
00:09:21.590 --> 00:09:21.600 align:start position:0%
and to look at how we can work across
 
00:09:24.750 --> 00:09:24.760 align:start position:0%
these various areas um I should also
 
00:09:27.430 --> 00:09:27.440 align:start position:0%
mention that there's been a lot of good
 
00:09:29.750 --> 00:09:29.760 align:start position:0%
cooperation and contribution and
 
00:09:32.550 --> 00:09:32.560 align:start position:0%
thoughts about how to work on this from
 
00:09:34.190 --> 00:09:34.200 align:start position:0%
such groups as The Nature
 
00:09:36.750 --> 00:09:36.760 align:start position:0%
Conservancy uh and others who as I will
 
00:09:38.069 --> 00:09:38.079 align:start position:0%
mention a little bit later are willing
 
00:09:40.350 --> 00:09:40.360 align:start position:0%
to help raise get some resources into
 
00:09:45.430 --> 00:09:45.440 align:start position:0%
into helping this uh function well um we
 
00:09:47.670 --> 00:09:47.680 align:start position:0%
have done a lot of previous studies and
 
00:09:50.630 --> 00:09:50.640 align:start position:0%
planning um and some of them are now out
 
00:09:52.949 --> 00:09:52.959 align:start position:0%
of date so it is time to look at them um
 
00:09:55.590 --> 00:09:55.600 align:start position:0%
back in 2010 we had a public health
 
00:10:00.110 --> 00:10:00.120 align:start position:0%
strategic plan um back around in 200 17
 
00:10:04.750 --> 00:10:04.760 align:start position:0%
we had a weathering change um about uh
 
00:10:07.550 --> 00:10:07.560 align:start position:0%
looking at what we can anticipate
 
00:10:10.350 --> 00:10:10.360 align:start position:0%
through increased precipitation and uh
 
00:10:13.269 --> 00:10:13.279 align:start position:0%
storm surge and and so forth um and
 
00:10:15.949 --> 00:10:15.959 align:start position:0%
there was also a a a Business Leaders
 
00:10:19.790 --> 00:10:19.800 align:start position:0%
report from 2017 on um risk avoidance
 
00:10:22.190 --> 00:10:22.200 align:start position:0%
and risk resilience then of course in
 
00:10:24.389 --> 00:10:24.399 align:start position:0%
2016 some of you may remember we had the
 
00:10:26.550 --> 00:10:26.560 align:start position:0%
coastal risk and Hazards commission
 
00:10:28.310 --> 00:10:28.320 align:start position:0%
report and uh you know with the support
 
00:10:30.150 --> 00:10:30.160 align:start position:0%
of Governor sonunu that that report came
 
00:10:31.829 --> 00:10:31.839 align:start position:0%
forward after commission H met to look
 
00:10:33.310 --> 00:10:33.320 align:start position:0%
at the coastal area in particular the
 
00:10:35.310 --> 00:10:35.320 align:start position:0%
risk and Hazards on the coast and
 
00:10:37.110 --> 00:10:37.120 align:start position:0%
essentially to plan out how to do risk
 
00:10:38.389 --> 00:10:38.399 align:start position:0%
and avoidance what what we could
 
00:10:40.030 --> 00:10:40.040 align:start position:0%
anticipate in the in the future happen
 
00:10:42.870 --> 00:10:42.880 align:start position:0%
on the coast and I think you know thank
 
00:10:45.430 --> 00:10:45.440 align:start position:0%
goodness we put in Dot and others put
 
00:10:47.269 --> 00:10:47.279 align:start position:0%
into Implement implemented some of the
 
00:10:48.629 --> 00:10:48.639 align:start position:0%
things that came out of the commission
 
00:10:50.110 --> 00:10:50.120 align:start position:0%
given what we've seen in the last few
 
00:10:52.190 --> 00:10:52.200 align:start position:0%
months on the on the coast bad damage
 
00:10:53.870 --> 00:10:53.880 align:start position:0%
but but could have been could have been
 
00:10:57.150 --> 00:10:57.160 align:start position:0%
worse um we also have uh from fishing
 
00:10:58.790 --> 00:10:58.800 align:start position:0%
game every 10 years they have to do
 
00:11:01.350 --> 00:11:01.360 align:start position:0%
their Wild life action plan the last one
 
00:11:05.990 --> 00:11:06.000 align:start position:0%
is 2015 um if you get their magazine uh
 
00:11:08.509 --> 00:11:08.519 align:start position:0%
they're working on the 20125 and the
 
00:11:11.389 --> 00:11:11.399 align:start position:0%
overall is managing for change um you
 
00:11:12.829 --> 00:11:12.839 align:start position:0%
know what what do they see happening
 
00:11:16.230 --> 00:11:16.240 align:start position:0%
with the the forests and uh fish fishing
 
00:11:18.269 --> 00:11:18.279 align:start position:0%
game movements warming waters for brook
 
00:11:20.069 --> 00:11:20.079 align:start position:0%
trout and so forth so as I said there a
 
00:11:22.069 --> 00:11:22.079 align:start position:0%
lot of pockets off of good planning
 
00:11:24.870 --> 00:11:24.880 align:start position:0%
going on um the doot in particular when
 
00:11:27.190 --> 00:11:27.200 align:start position:0%
they took the report of the coastal risk
 
00:11:29.389 --> 00:11:29.399 align:start position:0%
and Hazards commission uh we put in
 
00:11:31.150 --> 00:11:31.160 align:start position:0%
statute that they had to use projected
 
00:11:33.629 --> 00:11:33.639 align:start position:0%
sea level rise and that's why the the
 
00:11:36.670 --> 00:11:36.680 align:start position:0%
new the $40 million bridge on 1A is 4
 
00:11:38.509 --> 00:11:38.519 align:start position:0%
feet higher than it used to be smart
 
00:11:40.110 --> 00:11:40.120 align:start position:0%
planning and I think that's what we need
 
00:11:42.949 --> 00:11:42.959 align:start position:0%
to look at across uh across the
 
00:11:45.150 --> 00:11:45.160 align:start position:0%
agencies now I didn't invent this out a
 
00:11:46.949 --> 00:11:46.959 align:start position:0%
whole cloth because why not use the
 
00:11:49.870 --> 00:11:49.880 align:start position:0%
models that exist and if you look around
 
00:11:51.150 --> 00:11:51.160 align:start position:0%
you'll see that a lot of states are
 
00:11:53.750 --> 00:11:53.760 align:start position:0%
doing this um I think particularly um
 
00:11:56.310 --> 00:11:56.320 align:start position:0%
helpful to me was looking at Florida and
 
00:11:57.870 --> 00:11:57.880 align:start position:0%
the counties down there are very very
 
00:11:59.710 --> 00:11:59.720 align:start position:0%
powerful when it comes to to to planning
 
00:12:01.430 --> 00:12:01.440 align:start position:0%
in infrastructure and the counties in
 
00:12:02.829 --> 00:12:02.839 align:start position:0%
Florida have gotten together over the
 
00:12:05.509 --> 00:12:05.519 align:start position:0%
last few years to put put forward things
 
00:12:06.790 --> 00:12:06.800 align:start position:0%
just like this of how we're going to
 
00:12:08.829 --> 00:12:08.839 align:start position:0%
plan um I think Texas is pretty
 
00:12:11.069 --> 00:12:11.079 align:start position:0%
instructive too um not just around you
 
00:12:12.629 --> 00:12:12.639 align:start position:0%
know Galveston to Houston area and the
 
00:12:15.069 --> 00:12:15.079 align:start position:0%
coastal issues but then looking up to
 
00:12:16.189 --> 00:12:16.199 align:start position:0%
the rest of the state where they're
 
00:12:18.150 --> 00:12:18.160 align:start position:0%
seeing a drought we don't have a
 
00:12:20.670 --> 00:12:20.680 align:start position:0%
wildfire problem but you know they
 
00:12:22.230 --> 00:12:22.240 align:start position:0%
they've said we you know we we can't
 
00:12:24.389 --> 00:12:24.399 align:start position:0%
just plan for one little area we got to
 
00:12:27.269 --> 00:12:27.279 align:start position:0%
look look more broadly across it closer
 
00:12:30.750 --> 00:12:30.760 align:start position:0%
to us um I've looked at the honic river
 
00:12:32.710 --> 00:12:32.720 align:start position:0%
valley planning and uh that's
 
00:12:35.350 --> 00:12:35.360 align:start position:0%
interesting because it's a watershed
 
00:12:36.629 --> 00:12:36.639 align:start position:0%
that's very much like the northern half
 
00:12:38.829 --> 00:12:38.839 align:start position:0%
of our state in some ways and uh they're
 
00:12:41.230 --> 00:12:41.240 align:start position:0%
looking at okay what do we have to do to
 
00:12:43.389 --> 00:12:43.399 align:start position:0%
make sure that our tourist economy our
 
00:12:45.790 --> 00:12:45.800 align:start position:0%
our Fisheries our clean water and so
 
00:12:48.790 --> 00:12:48.800 align:start position:0%
forth um are preserved across the wed uh
 
00:12:51.030 --> 00:12:51.040 align:start position:0%
so that's that's Connecticut and uh
 
00:12:53.509 --> 00:12:53.519 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and and New York little
 
00:12:55.030 --> 00:12:55.040 align:start position:0%
closer to home too you'll see that all
 
00:12:57.470 --> 00:12:57.480 align:start position:0%
the states around us uh have something
 
00:12:59.509 --> 00:12:59.519 align:start position:0%
very similar sometime in legislation
 
00:13:03.590 --> 00:13:03.600 align:start position:0%
sometime in um you know Governor's order
 
00:13:06.389 --> 00:13:06.399 align:start position:0%
um but particularly for for Maine uh
 
00:13:07.389 --> 00:13:07.399 align:start position:0%
you'll see what they're trying to do
 
00:13:09.310 --> 00:13:09.320 align:start position:0%
about the coast and they have a you know
 
00:13:11.829 --> 00:13:11.839 align:start position:0%
very similar kind of thing here um I did
 
00:13:13.389 --> 00:13:13.399 align:start position:0%
look kind of particularly to the state
 
00:13:15.230 --> 00:13:15.240 align:start position:0%
of Pennsylvania because that's the first
 
00:13:16.750 --> 00:13:16.760 align:start position:0%
state where there's been a comprehensive
 
00:13:19.189 --> 00:13:19.199 align:start position:0%
economic study on what they can expect
 
00:13:23.150 --> 00:13:23.160 align:start position:0%
to see on you know to roads to Ports uh
 
00:13:25.790 --> 00:13:25.800 align:start position:0%
air conditioning schools uh heating
 
00:13:27.430 --> 00:13:27.440 align:start position:0%
centers drought and so on on the
 
00:13:30.110 --> 00:13:30.120 align:start position:0%
agriculture on the or on the forestry
 
00:13:31.629 --> 00:13:31.639 align:start position:0%
big a much bigger State than we are but
 
00:13:33.829 --> 00:13:33.839 align:start position:0%
they're projecting 11 to 12 billion
 
00:13:37.710 --> 00:13:37.720 align:start position:0%
anticipated cost and so um they're some
 
00:13:40.389 --> 00:13:40.399 align:start position:0%
other states are and uh cities are now
 
00:13:41.750 --> 00:13:41.760 align:start position:0%
doing similar kind of trying to do some
 
00:13:44.590 --> 00:13:44.600 align:start position:0%
cost projections and to figure out okay
 
00:13:46.350 --> 00:13:46.360 align:start position:0%
if we're expecting these kinds of costs
 
00:13:48.069 --> 00:13:48.079 align:start position:0%
what do we do about it how do we save
 
00:13:50.110 --> 00:13:50.120 align:start position:0%
money and how do we adapt now so we
 
00:13:52.910 --> 00:13:52.920 align:start position:0%
don't get uh hit with those um the last
 
00:13:55.350 --> 00:13:55.360 align:start position:0%
thing as introduction I mention as well
 
00:13:55.360 --> 00:13:56.069 align:start position:0%
thing as introduction I mention as well
is

00:13:56.069 --> 00:13:56.079 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:14:00.350 --> 00:14:00.360 align:start position:0%
that um I you see in this bill that kind
 
00:14:02.189 --> 00:14:02.199 align:start position:0%
of bracketed off mitigation what they
 
00:14:05.069 --> 00:14:05.079 align:start position:0%
call mitigation from adaptation
 
00:14:06.949 --> 00:14:06.959 align:start position:0%
mitigation is what are we're doing about
 
00:14:09.670 --> 00:14:09.680 align:start position:0%
energy and the department of energy got
 
00:14:15.350 --> 00:14:15.360 align:start position:0%
$3 million Grant um from in yes from uh
 
00:14:17.990 --> 00:14:18.000 align:start position:0%
the federal government to do an energy
 
00:14:21.030 --> 00:14:21.040 align:start position:0%
action plan and that plan is the first
 
00:14:23.550 --> 00:14:23.560 align:start position:0%
draft has been completed fantastic stuff
 
00:14:25.870 --> 00:14:25.880 align:start position:0%
about Energy Efficiency and you know
 
00:14:27.470 --> 00:14:27.480 align:start position:0%
what are ways we can reduce costs
 
00:14:30.350 --> 00:14:30.360 align:start position:0%
through reducing energy costs and then
 
00:14:32.350 --> 00:14:32.360 align:start position:0%
when we complete that the state will be
 
00:14:33.990 --> 00:14:34.000 align:start position:0%
available for tens of millions of
 
00:14:36.310 --> 00:14:36.320 align:start position:0%
dollars of Grants so that that that's on
 
00:14:37.629 --> 00:14:37.639 align:start position:0%
the energy side this is about the
 
00:14:39.949 --> 00:14:39.959 align:start position:0%
adaptation resilience side and that
 
00:14:42.670 --> 00:14:42.680 align:start position:0%
that's why the the focus is that is is
 
00:14:45.509 --> 00:14:45.519 align:start position:0%
here um if we could turn to the um bill
 
00:14:49.550 --> 00:14:49.560 align:start position:0%
I will highlight uh some things um here
 
00:14:54.870 --> 00:14:54.880 align:start position:0%
and uh let me um look to the page two
 
00:14:58.629 --> 00:14:58.639 align:start position:0%
and who's on it and as I said I have uh
 
00:15:01.310 --> 00:15:01.320 align:start position:0%
talked with all these folks and um
 
00:15:03.310 --> 00:15:03.320 align:start position:0%
gotten some very good advice and learned
 
00:15:05.310 --> 00:15:05.320 align:start position:0%
a lot about planning that is already
 
00:15:09.269 --> 00:15:09.279 align:start position:0%
underway um in uh in those agencies a
 
00:15:11.189 --> 00:15:11.199 align:start position:0%
couple of changes I note that the the
 
00:15:14.470 --> 00:15:14.480 align:start position:0%
Senate um was asked to do uh
 
00:15:15.790 --> 00:15:15.800 align:start position:0%
commissioner Jasper thought it' be
 
00:15:18.629 --> 00:15:18.639 align:start position:0%
better than him on this to have the
 
00:15:20.069 --> 00:15:20.079 align:start position:0%
director of New Hampshire agriculture
 
00:15:22.509 --> 00:15:22.519 align:start position:0%
experiment station uh so you'll see that
 
00:15:28.110 --> 00:15:28.120 align:start position:0%
on on uh um line 11 um and then as I
 
00:15:31.629 --> 00:15:31.639 align:start position:0%
noticed uh noted on page uh on line 23
 
00:15:33.550 --> 00:15:33.560 align:start position:0%
uh the nonprofit organizations who could
 
00:15:37.550 --> 00:15:37.560 align:start position:0%
help us with some funding um and then uh
 
00:15:39.189 --> 00:15:39.199 align:start position:0%
I will talk a little bit more about
 
00:15:42.350 --> 00:15:42.360 align:start position:0%
somebody with expertise in climate uh
 
00:15:45.389 --> 00:15:45.399 align:start position:0%
science and uh the state um
 
00:15:47.550 --> 00:15:47.560 align:start position:0%
climatologist Mary stampone I don't know
 
00:15:48.670 --> 00:15:48.680 align:start position:0%
she sent you a letter but I have a
 
00:15:49.749 --> 00:15:49.759 align:start position:0%
letter from her that came into the
 
00:15:51.509 --> 00:15:51.519 align:start position:0%
Senate saying she's more than willing to
 
00:15:54.870 --> 00:15:54.880 align:start position:0%
to take on uh on on that um and then the
 
00:15:57.949 --> 00:15:57.959 align:start position:0%
Bia I really appreciate the uh work with
 
00:16:01.150 --> 00:16:01.160 align:start position:0%
the Bia and uh their inclusion on this
 
00:16:02.870 --> 00:16:02.880 align:start position:0%
as as
 
00:16:05.230 --> 00:16:05.240 align:start position:0%
well um we did a lot of work on the
 
00:16:07.150 --> 00:16:07.160 align:start position:0%
Senate and trying to figure out just how
 
00:16:09.670 --> 00:16:09.680 align:start position:0%
this would work um Department of
 
00:16:11.910 --> 00:16:11.920 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services you will hear was
 
00:16:14.389 --> 00:16:14.399 align:start position:0%
anxious about whether there potential
 
00:16:16.110 --> 00:16:16.120 align:start position:0%
costs or Staffing that they would have
 
00:16:18.389 --> 00:16:18.399 align:start position:0%
to provide because they certainly you
 
00:16:21.590 --> 00:16:21.600 align:start position:0%
know could be a center of this activity
 
00:16:23.189 --> 00:16:23.199 align:start position:0%
and you'll note that the bill does not
 
00:16:24.870 --> 00:16:24.880 align:start position:0%
have a fiscal note because I think we've
 
00:16:27.829 --> 00:16:27.839 align:start position:0%
dealt with that in some ways um you'll
 
00:16:29.749 --> 00:16:29.759 align:start position:0%
see uh that while while the dees
 
00:16:31.749 --> 00:16:31.759 align:start position:0%
commissioner will call the first meeting
 
00:16:34.150 --> 00:16:34.160 align:start position:0%
that the dees commissioner is not
 
00:16:36.870 --> 00:16:36.880 align:start position:0%
responsible for chairing or Staffing it
 
00:16:39.269 --> 00:16:39.279 align:start position:0%
and there are Provisions in the bill um
 
00:16:41.949 --> 00:16:41.959 align:start position:0%
for the seeking of grant funding and uh
 
00:16:44.749 --> 00:16:44.759 align:start position:0%
I have some indications from Health
 
00:16:48.110 --> 00:16:48.120 align:start position:0%
Homeland Security from HHS from do and
 
00:16:50.030 --> 00:16:50.040 align:start position:0%
others that there might be funding that
 
00:16:51.670 --> 00:16:51.680 align:start position:0%
they currently get that some of it could
 
00:16:53.350 --> 00:16:53.360 align:start position:0%
be directed to help with a planning and
 
00:16:55.269 --> 00:16:55.279 align:start position:0%
there is some commitment from the
 
00:16:57.189 --> 00:16:57.199 align:start position:0%
nonprofits to try to raise some money as
 
00:16:58.629 --> 00:16:58.639 align:start position:0%
was done for the castal risk and Hazards
 
00:17:01.350 --> 00:17:01.360 align:start position:0%
commit to help with uh help with that
 
00:17:02.790 --> 00:17:02.800 align:start position:0%
it's going to be twice a
 
00:17:05.390 --> 00:17:05.400 align:start position:0%
year um and it only is going to take on
 
00:17:06.990 --> 00:17:07.000 align:start position:0%
those you know this bill will probably
 
00:17:08.630 --> 00:17:08.640 align:start position:0%
looks more complicated than it really is
 
00:17:10.870 --> 00:17:10.880 align:start position:0%
I got the laundry list uh coming up but
 
00:17:12.590 --> 00:17:12.600 align:start position:0%
it's only it's going to take on these
 
00:17:15.429 --> 00:17:15.439 align:start position:0%
activities as they see fit and as seems
 
00:17:17.870 --> 00:17:17.880 align:start position:0%
appropriate uh and hear reports about
 
00:17:20.230 --> 00:17:20.240 align:start position:0%
what various agencies are doing so they
 
00:17:23.470 --> 00:17:23.480 align:start position:0%
they can uh coordinate um with it I
 
00:17:24.829 --> 00:17:24.839 align:start position:0%
think what's particularly important is
 
00:17:26.949 --> 00:17:26.959 align:start position:0%
at the bottom of page two when I get
 
00:17:29.549 --> 00:17:29.559 align:start position:0%
into one of the principles here um
 
00:17:31.430 --> 00:17:31.440 align:start position:0%
Innovation and government
 
00:17:34.710 --> 00:17:34.720 align:start position:0%
operations effective approaches that
 
00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:35.630 align:start position:0%
operations effective approaches that
build

00:17:35.630 --> 00:17:35.640 align:start position:0%
build
 
00:17:38.310 --> 00:17:38.320 align:start position:0%
resilience against environmental changes
 
00:17:40.990 --> 00:17:41.000 align:start position:0%
protection of Public Health particularly
 
00:17:42.669 --> 00:17:42.679 align:start position:0%
important to me is to Foster business
 
00:17:44.549 --> 00:17:44.559 align:start position:0%
and Workforce Development we've got to
 
00:17:46.150 --> 00:17:46.160 align:start position:0%
have a thriving economy whether it's the
 
00:17:49.070 --> 00:17:49.080 align:start position:0%
tourist economy or the economy along the
 
00:17:51.669 --> 00:17:51.679 align:start position:0%
on the coast um and then protecting the
 
00:17:54.150 --> 00:17:54.160 align:start position:0%
taxpayer um let's let's look at how we
 
00:17:56.830 --> 00:17:56.840 align:start position:0%
can save money for public investment um
 
00:17:59.230 --> 00:17:59.240 align:start position:0%
for Public Safety and protect the
 
00:18:02.750 --> 00:18:02.760 align:start position:0%
taxpayer um as well starting on page
 
00:18:05.390 --> 00:18:05.400 align:start position:0%
three on line nine that all important
 
00:18:07.190 --> 00:18:07.200 align:start position:0%
phrase subject to the availability of
 
00:18:11.669 --> 00:18:11.679 align:start position:0%
resources so the commission the council
 
00:18:15.149 --> 00:18:15.159 align:start position:0%
will have the um wisdom to decide what
 
00:18:16.549 --> 00:18:16.559 align:start position:0%
they ought to look at when they ought to
 
00:18:18.590 --> 00:18:18.600 align:start position:0%
look at it in these things let me just
 
00:18:20.710 --> 00:18:20.720 align:start position:0%
point out a few things on the activities
 
00:18:23.950 --> 00:18:23.960 align:start position:0%
here on line 11 on page three um it's
 
00:18:25.990 --> 00:18:26.000 align:start position:0%
going to be important to have good maps
 
00:18:28.110 --> 00:18:28.120 align:start position:0%
um what are we what are we looking at um
 
00:18:29.789 --> 00:18:29.799 align:start position:0%
we have some good Maps now particular in
 
00:18:31.950 --> 00:18:31.960 align:start position:0%
the Coter area there's a coastal mapper
 
00:18:34.110 --> 00:18:34.120 align:start position:0%
which you can go online and find and you
 
00:18:36.310 --> 00:18:36.320 align:start position:0%
can see if you want to project six in of
 
00:18:38.750 --> 00:18:38.760 align:start position:0%
seal of AR rise or a storm surge from
 
00:18:41.149 --> 00:18:41.159 align:start position:0%
like one of the northeaster we've had
 
00:18:42.710 --> 00:18:42.720 align:start position:0%
you can see what areas might be
 
00:18:45.470 --> 00:18:45.480 align:start position:0%
vulnerable the FEMA Maps down there and
 
00:18:47.230 --> 00:18:47.240 align:start position:0%
then across the state too you know we
 
00:18:51.070 --> 00:18:51.080 align:start position:0%
we've seen in the last 20 30 years about
 
00:18:54.630 --> 00:18:54.640 align:start position:0%
a about a 25% increase in the annual
 
00:18:57.190 --> 00:18:57.200 align:start position:0%
rainfall and also the extreme
 
00:18:58.870 --> 00:18:58.880 align:start position:0%
precipitation events and that's why
 
00:19:00.630 --> 00:19:00.640 align:start position:0%
blowing out culverts out in the western
 
00:19:03.110 --> 00:19:03.120 align:start position:0%
part of the state or up North so we need
 
00:19:05.549 --> 00:19:05.559 align:start position:0%
some good maps some some mapping and so
 
00:19:08.149 --> 00:19:08.159 align:start position:0%
um that's why uh to look at the
 
00:19:10.110 --> 00:19:10.120 align:start position:0%
available maps and if we think there
 
00:19:12.190 --> 00:19:12.200 align:start position:0%
needs to be some more maps than um
 
00:19:13.830 --> 00:19:13.840 align:start position:0%
perhaps University of Hampshire other
 
00:19:16.190 --> 00:19:16.200 align:start position:0%
places are doing this now can help them
 
00:19:19.310 --> 00:19:19.320 align:start position:0%
um with that and then um coordinated
 
00:19:20.830 --> 00:19:20.840 align:start position:0%
planning that's that's really the heart
 
00:19:23.070 --> 00:19:23.080 align:start position:0%
of it start line 15 is to you know take
 
00:19:24.230 --> 00:19:24.240 align:start position:0%
a look at the planning you're already
 
00:19:26.710 --> 00:19:26.720 align:start position:0%
doing and are there gaps there about
 
00:19:28.789 --> 00:19:28.799 align:start position:0%
looking to the future I mean a lot lot
 
00:19:31.230 --> 00:19:31.240 align:start position:0%
of our planning is kind of reactive
 
00:19:33.149 --> 00:19:33.159 align:start position:0%
sometimes you know home and security
 
00:19:34.750 --> 00:19:34.760 align:start position:0%
something goes bad how we going to deal
 
00:19:38.110 --> 00:19:38.120 align:start position:0%
with a crisis but proactive planning um
 
00:19:39.710 --> 00:19:39.720 align:start position:0%
and even in a 10-year plan you know
 
00:19:41.390 --> 00:19:41.400 align:start position:0%
where we have put in statute that they
 
00:19:43.830 --> 00:19:43.840 align:start position:0%
have to use certain um criteria for
 
00:19:46.350 --> 00:19:46.360 align:start position:0%
determining what future sea rise in the
 
00:19:48.789 --> 00:19:48.799 align:start position:0%
Sea Coast Area uh is or groundwater
 
00:19:51.270 --> 00:19:51.280 align:start position:0%
intrusion and so forth um on road
 
00:19:54.510 --> 00:19:54.520 align:start position:0%
condition um then may be that some other
 
00:19:56.710 --> 00:19:56.720 align:start position:0%
agencies uh need to start looking
 
00:19:59.710 --> 00:19:59.720 align:start position:0%
forward uh to this adaptation and that's
 
00:20:00.830 --> 00:20:00.840 align:start position:0%
you'll see some of the ones that are
 
00:20:03.270 --> 00:20:03.280 align:start position:0%
named there which I think um that they
 
00:20:05.310 --> 00:20:05.320 align:start position:0%
could look at and then coordinate that
 
00:20:07.830 --> 00:20:07.840 align:start position:0%
planning um it probably is awfully good
 
00:20:10.430 --> 00:20:10.440 align:start position:0%
for do and fishing game to get together
 
00:20:11.830 --> 00:20:11.840 align:start position:0%
if it looks like animals going to be
 
00:20:15.630 --> 00:20:15.640 align:start position:0%
moving into different areas or um you
 
00:20:16.909 --> 00:20:16.919 align:start position:0%
know have to look at what's going to
 
00:20:20.190 --> 00:20:20.200 align:start position:0%
happen with Stream flow and culs and
 
00:20:22.310 --> 00:20:22.320 align:start position:0%
need for brook trout or whatever to be
 
00:20:24.830 --> 00:20:24.840 align:start position:0%
able to move to cooler Waters the this
 
00:20:26.110 --> 00:20:26.120 align:start position:0%
is the kind of getting together I'm
 
00:20:29.149 --> 00:20:29.159 align:start position:0%
talking about um
 
00:20:32.230 --> 00:20:32.240 align:start position:0%
and also uh look at the ways in which um
 
00:20:34.270 --> 00:20:34.280 align:start position:0%
the coast so I you know take another
 
00:20:36.549 --> 00:20:36.559 align:start position:0%
look at the 2016 report for the coast
 
00:20:39.789 --> 00:20:39.799 align:start position:0%
RIS hazards um as I said we have a
 
00:20:43.350 --> 00:20:43.360 align:start position:0%
rather out ofd um Public Health Report
 
00:20:46.710 --> 00:20:46.720 align:start position:0%
and uh HHS is very enthusiastic about
 
00:20:49.230 --> 00:20:49.240 align:start position:0%
getting back into planning about uh
 
00:20:52.350 --> 00:20:52.360 align:start position:0%
Public Health particularly with heat um
 
00:20:55.669 --> 00:20:55.679 align:start position:0%
and air quality uh allergies as it gets
 
00:20:58.029 --> 00:20:58.039 align:start position:0%
warmer i' I've got I've got allergies
 
00:20:59.310 --> 00:20:59.320 align:start position:0%
right and they're coming earlier every
 
00:21:01.510 --> 00:21:01.520 align:start position:0%
year um so these are the public health
 
00:21:03.789 --> 00:21:03.799 align:start position:0%
things that they they think we ought to
 
00:21:07.549 --> 00:21:07.559 align:start position:0%
um look at and then uh section e there
 
00:21:09.190 --> 00:21:09.200 align:start position:0%
um there's already a lot of talk about
 
00:21:10.549 --> 00:21:10.559 align:start position:0%
what are we going to do about air
 
00:21:12.310 --> 00:21:12.320 align:start position:0%
conditioning um whether it's state
 
00:21:14.990 --> 00:21:15.000 align:start position:0%
buildings or particularly Public Schools
 
00:21:16.669 --> 00:21:16.679 align:start position:0%
um what are we going to have to do it's
 
00:21:19.149 --> 00:21:19.159 align:start position:0%
uh my district of Summers worth they had
 
00:21:21.029 --> 00:21:21.039 align:start position:0%
a two classrooms they couldn't use
 
00:21:23.070 --> 00:21:23.080 align:start position:0%
starting in May and they had to spend a
 
00:21:26.350 --> 00:21:26.360 align:start position:0%
lot of money to redo the the hbac to
 
00:21:28.230 --> 00:21:28.240 align:start position:0%
take care of of that so we ought we
 
00:21:30.269 --> 00:21:30.279 align:start position:0%
ought to you know and what kind of
 
00:21:32.149 --> 00:21:32.159 align:start position:0%
public State resources might we be
 
00:21:34.710 --> 00:21:34.720 align:start position:0%
looking at to deal with some of those uh
 
00:21:37.190 --> 00:21:37.200 align:start position:0%
things and really to Mr chairman to the
 
00:21:39.789 --> 00:21:39.799 align:start position:0%
heart of this committee um FG and H I
 
00:21:42.870 --> 00:21:42.880 align:start position:0%
mean this is your sweet spot on this
 
00:21:46.149 --> 00:21:46.159 align:start position:0%
committee um State what how we going to
 
00:21:48.149 --> 00:21:48.159 align:start position:0%
have more resilient
 
00:21:50.390 --> 00:21:50.400 align:start position:0%
Transportation what are future funding
 
00:21:52.990 --> 00:21:53.000 align:start position:0%
needs for enhance of the storm drainage
 
00:21:54.909 --> 00:21:54.919 align:start position:0%
roads Bridges I I mentioned the you know
 
00:21:59.590 --> 00:21:59.600 align:start position:0%
the 4 foot elevation of routee 1A and uh
 
00:22:01.110 --> 00:22:01.120 align:start position:0%
where those other Coastal roads going to
 
00:22:02.549 --> 00:22:02.559 align:start position:0%
be elevated how we going to do it how we
 
00:22:04.870 --> 00:22:04.880 align:start position:0%
going to pay for it I I don't really see
 
00:22:07.070 --> 00:22:07.080 align:start position:0%
how municipalities themselves can
 
00:22:10.269 --> 00:22:10.279 align:start position:0%
shoulder all these costs um so I think
 
00:22:13.750 --> 00:22:13.760 align:start position:0%
we got to start seeing what we can do um
 
00:22:16.710 --> 00:22:16.720 align:start position:0%
there and uh state funded facilities
 
00:22:19.310 --> 00:22:19.320 align:start position:0%
State facilities um you know we spent a
 
00:22:20.830 --> 00:22:20.840 align:start position:0%
lot of money on capital budget the last
 
00:22:22.590 --> 00:22:22.600 align:start position:0%
few years looking at roofs that need to
 
00:22:25.190 --> 00:22:25.200 align:start position:0%
replace on various state buildings and
 
00:22:28.190 --> 00:22:28.200 align:start position:0%
uh we we probably ought to get ahead of
 
00:22:31.070 --> 00:22:31.080 align:start position:0%
that a little bit as as well um and then
 
00:22:32.470 --> 00:22:32.480 align:start position:0%
you know I'm thank goodness we got the
 
00:22:34.830 --> 00:22:34.840 align:start position:0%
$2 million from the feds last week for
 
00:22:38.630 --> 00:22:38.640 align:start position:0%
the coastal seaw wall rebuild um next
 
00:22:38.640 --> 00:22:39.830 align:start position:0%
the coastal seaw wall rebuild um next
big

00:22:39.830 --> 00:22:39.840 align:start position:0%
big
 
00:22:42.070 --> 00:22:42.080 align:start position:0%
storm is it going to blow them all out
 
00:22:45.350 --> 00:22:45.360 align:start position:0%
again um so we really need to and our
 
00:22:48.029 --> 00:22:48.039 align:start position:0%
ports too um you know portter Portsmouth
 
00:22:49.549 --> 00:22:49.559 align:start position:0%
we were putting tens of millions of
 
00:22:51.950 --> 00:22:51.960 align:start position:0%
dollars into the port there to create a
 
00:22:55.310 --> 00:22:55.320 align:start position:0%
larger deck and to make it um more able
 
00:22:56.950 --> 00:22:56.960 align:start position:0%
to handle ships that are coming in
 
00:22:59.070 --> 00:22:59.080 align:start position:0%
whether it's for offshore wind or you
 
00:23:01.669 --> 00:23:01.679 align:start position:0%
know everything else that's handled down
 
00:23:04.230 --> 00:23:04.240 align:start position:0%
there um but that Port facility is an
 
00:23:06.750 --> 00:23:06.760 align:start position:0%
economic engine and we have to you know
 
00:23:07.789 --> 00:23:07.799 align:start position:0%
kind of that's another thing we're going
 
00:23:08.830 --> 00:23:08.840 align:start position:0%
to be looking at because the state
 
00:23:13.230 --> 00:23:13.240 align:start position:0%
spends money uh on on that the next one
 
00:23:15.350 --> 00:23:15.360 align:start position:0%
and I is really about Homeland Security
 
00:23:18.789 --> 00:23:18.799 align:start position:0%
and HHS uh and again this is written
 
00:23:21.110 --> 00:23:21.120 align:start position:0%
with the advice of both of them in the
 
00:23:23.789 --> 00:23:23.799 align:start position:0%
language there uh a lot of good talks
 
00:23:27.029 --> 00:23:27.039 align:start position:0%
with the um Timberland Owners
 
00:23:28.549 --> 00:23:28.559 align:start position:0%
Association Department of Agriculture
 
00:23:30.710 --> 00:23:30.720 align:start position:0%
culture about what are we anticipating
 
00:23:34.710 --> 00:23:34.720 align:start position:0%
about forests um you know as uh
 
00:23:37.990 --> 00:23:38.000 align:start position:0%
migrating pests are coming in and we're
 
00:23:41.350 --> 00:23:41.360 align:start position:0%
seeing threats to our forest I mean my
 
00:23:43.310 --> 00:23:43.320 align:start position:0%
God we're losing white we're losing Ash
 
00:23:46.350 --> 00:23:46.360 align:start position:0%
the sprute budworms all these all these
 
00:23:48.789 --> 00:23:48.799 align:start position:0%
uh threats to our forest that we see
 
00:23:51.870 --> 00:23:51.880 align:start position:0%
slowly marching uh North and and it's
 
00:23:53.710 --> 00:23:53.720 align:start position:0%
not just the forest products but it's
 
00:23:56.390 --> 00:23:56.400 align:start position:0%
also tourism um that we got to kind of
 
00:23:57.710 --> 00:23:57.720 align:start position:0%
look at what what we can do about
 
00:23:59.269 --> 00:23:59.279 align:start position:0%
adaptation to make make sure our tourist
 
00:24:03.230 --> 00:24:03.240 align:start position:0%
economy up north um Can Survive I think
 
00:24:04.990 --> 00:24:05.000 align:start position:0%
particularly important as well Mr
 
00:24:07.830 --> 00:24:07.840 align:start position:0%
chairman for this committee and thinking
 
00:24:12.070 --> 00:24:12.080 align:start position:0%
about the state assets is uh section k
 
00:24:14.549 --> 00:24:14.559 align:start position:0%
um what are the revenue impacts likely
 
00:24:14.559 --> 00:24:16.269 align:start position:0%
um what are the revenue impacts likely
to

00:24:16.269 --> 00:24:16.279 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:24:18.549 --> 00:24:18.559 align:start position:0%
be uh
 
00:24:21.510 --> 00:24:21.520 align:start position:0%
if the change continues the way it is if
 
00:24:24.070 --> 00:24:24.080 align:start position:0%
we have the inability to maintain the
 
00:24:26.710 --> 00:24:26.720 align:start position:0%
same length of the ski season or um
 
00:24:28.909 --> 00:24:28.919 align:start position:0%
along the coast with the beaches um what
 
00:24:31.230 --> 00:24:31.240 align:start position:0%
are the impacts of revenues uh going to
 
00:24:33.590 --> 00:24:33.600 align:start position:0%
be also a lot of the Credit raing
 
00:24:35.909 --> 00:24:35.919 align:start position:0%
Agencies Moody's and others are already
 
00:24:38.630 --> 00:24:38.640 align:start position:0%
um starting to use uh a look at if there
 
00:24:41.630 --> 00:24:41.640 align:start position:0%
is resilience planning um in terms of
 
00:24:43.110 --> 00:24:43.120 align:start position:0%
when they give their bond rating for
 
00:24:46.389 --> 00:24:46.399 align:start position:0%
municipalities and for States
 
00:24:48.510 --> 00:24:48.520 align:start position:0%
so that's going to be important in terms
 
00:24:50.310 --> 00:24:50.320 align:start position:0%
of the cost of the taxpayer if we get
 
00:24:51.909 --> 00:24:51.919 align:start position:0%
better Bond ratings because we plan for
 
00:24:53.630 --> 00:24:53.640 align:start position:0%
resilience and adaptation that's going
 
00:24:55.590 --> 00:24:55.600 align:start position:0%
to help the taxpayer as
 
00:24:57.950 --> 00:24:57.960 align:start position:0%
well um I think also particularly
 
00:25:01.630 --> 00:25:01.640 align:start position:0%
insurance insance costs um you know we
 
00:25:03.350 --> 00:25:03.360 align:start position:0%
we we probably ought to take a good look
 
00:25:05.430 --> 00:25:05.440 align:start position:0%
at that uh I I thought back and forth
 
00:25:06.870 --> 00:25:06.880 align:start position:0%
about having insurance commissioner on
 
00:25:08.470 --> 00:25:08.480 align:start position:0%
here but it seemed better to just
 
00:25:10.590 --> 00:25:10.600 align:start position:0%
consult with the insurance commissioner
 
00:25:16.909 --> 00:25:16.919 align:start position:0%
as as uh as as needed um and then uh the
 
00:25:19.510 --> 00:25:19.520 align:start position:0%
heart of it too in L make recommendation
 
00:25:21.350 --> 00:25:21.360 align:start position:0%
on Pro potential funding to protect New
 
00:25:22.789 --> 00:25:22.799 align:start position:0%
Hampshire taxpayers from bearing the
 
00:25:25.870 --> 00:25:25.880 align:start position:0%
full Co burden of costs and to explore
 
00:25:28.310 --> 00:25:28.320 align:start position:0%
Innovative financing as I say I I don't
 
00:25:30.070 --> 00:25:30.080 align:start position:0%
don't know how we can burden our
 
00:25:32.389 --> 00:25:32.399 align:start position:0%
municipalities and the taxpayer with all
 
00:25:34.350 --> 00:25:34.360 align:start position:0%
the costs that might be anticipated so
 
00:25:36.070 --> 00:25:36.080 align:start position:0%
what we can what can we look for for
 
00:25:38.510 --> 00:25:38.520 align:start position:0%
Grants and if we have a good planning
 
00:25:40.990 --> 00:25:41.000 align:start position:0%
process like that we have a leg up on
 
00:25:42.870 --> 00:25:42.880 align:start position:0%
being able to get the federal grants
 
00:25:45.029 --> 00:25:45.039 align:start position:0%
they look to they look to us having
 
00:25:50.190 --> 00:25:50.200 align:start position:0%
something uh like like this um and just
 
00:25:52.149 --> 00:25:52.159 align:start position:0%
a few minutes more Mr chairman I'm sorry
 
00:25:53.990 --> 00:25:54.000 align:start position:0%
to go for so long but I did want to walk
 
00:25:56.590 --> 00:25:56.600 align:start position:0%
us through you you do have great breath
 
00:25:58.750 --> 00:25:58.760 align:start position:0%
quality I'm me
 
00:26:00.669 --> 00:26:00.679 align:start position:0%
I was a professor for 39 years and I
 
00:26:03.029 --> 00:26:03.039 align:start position:0%
could fill 40 minutes like that okay but
 
00:26:06.990 --> 00:26:07.000 align:start position:0%
I won't do it please please continue
 
00:26:09.990 --> 00:26:10.000 align:start position:0%
s um I think some coming from the lesson
 
00:26:11.230 --> 00:26:11.240 align:start position:0%
of the castal risk and Hazards
 
00:26:12.789 --> 00:26:12.799 align:start position:0%
commission when we went into that there
 
00:26:15.990 --> 00:26:16.000 align:start position:0%
was a lot of um dispute over what are we
 
00:26:17.830 --> 00:26:17.840 align:start position:0%
really looking at and what can we
 
00:26:19.909 --> 00:26:19.919 align:start position:0%
anticipate particularly for storm
 
00:26:22.750 --> 00:26:22.760 align:start position:0%
surgeon SE of Horizon on the coast so we
 
00:26:24.789 --> 00:26:24.799 align:start position:0%
thought what was best was establish a
 
00:26:27.310 --> 00:26:27.320 align:start position:0%
separate group that could look at a
 
00:26:27.320 --> 00:26:28.870 align:start position:0%
separate group that could look at a
Baseline

00:26:28.870 --> 00:26:28.880 align:start position:0%
Baseline
 
00:26:31.630 --> 00:26:31.640 align:start position:0%
of what the commission could use and I
 
00:26:34.149 --> 00:26:34.159 align:start position:0%
thought that would make sense here we're
 
00:26:35.389 --> 00:26:35.399 align:start position:0%
not talking about a lot of new
 
00:26:37.750 --> 00:26:37.760 align:start position:0%
sciencetific research the the research
 
00:26:39.470 --> 00:26:39.480 align:start position:0%
is available but here's where the state
 
00:26:41.350 --> 00:26:41.360 align:start position:0%
climatologists and some other folks who
 
00:26:43.710 --> 00:26:43.720 align:start position:0%
get together say to the commission
 
00:26:47.470 --> 00:26:47.480 align:start position:0%
across the state here's the best guess
 
00:26:49.630 --> 00:26:49.640 align:start position:0%
of what you need to look for and that
 
00:26:52.110 --> 00:26:52.120 align:start position:0%
will give a baseline for the uh
 
00:26:55.710 --> 00:26:55.720 align:start position:0%
commission um to to look at
 
00:26:58.789 --> 00:26:58.799 align:start position:0%
um and uh then let's last part of the
 
00:27:01.230 --> 00:27:01.240 align:start position:0%
bill gets down to the financing uh how
 
00:27:03.070 --> 00:27:03.080 align:start position:0%
we're going to how we're going to find
 
00:27:07.190 --> 00:27:07.200 align:start position:0%
some dollars and um so you'll see bottom
 
00:27:12.110 --> 00:27:12.120 align:start position:0%
of page four the working groups um and
 
00:27:14.389 --> 00:27:14.399 align:start position:0%
the the council itself can look to
 
00:27:16.190 --> 00:27:16.200 align:start position:0%
federal grants and other
 
00:27:19.510 --> 00:27:19.520 align:start position:0%
sources uh there very important to
 
00:27:21.750 --> 00:27:21.760 align:start position:0%
Senator berdo was that we include on
 
00:27:23.230 --> 00:27:23.240 align:start position:0%
page on line
 
00:27:26.230 --> 00:27:26.240 align:start position:0%
35 that it is the legislature which
 
00:27:29.909 --> 00:27:29.919 align:start position:0%
controls the money so that here it says
 
00:27:31.909 --> 00:27:31.919 align:start position:0%
the reception of such funds shall
 
00:27:33.950 --> 00:27:33.960 align:start position:0%
require the approval of the joint fiscal
 
00:27:36.430 --> 00:27:36.440 align:start position:0%
committee if the joint fiscal committee
 
00:27:38.549 --> 00:27:38.559 align:start position:0%
is not comfortable with the source of
 
00:27:42.310 --> 00:27:42.320 align:start position:0%
any funds it can say no and I think
 
00:27:44.669 --> 00:27:44.679 align:start position:0%
that's important Gate Keeper function
 
00:27:47.190 --> 00:27:47.200 align:start position:0%
you also see an important gatekeeper
 
00:27:49.990 --> 00:27:50.000 align:start position:0%
function uh on page
 
00:27:54.350 --> 00:27:54.360 align:start position:0%
five um where we set up this fund that
 
00:27:56.830 --> 00:27:56.840 align:start position:0%
can receive federal grants and other and
 
00:27:59.950 --> 00:27:59.960 align:start position:0%
uh private nonprofits Report with uh and
 
00:28:03.509 --> 00:28:03.519 align:start position:0%
it says okay fine but before you spend
 
00:28:04.750 --> 00:28:04.760 align:start position:0%
any of
 
00:28:07.110 --> 00:28:07.120 align:start position:0%
that you've got to get the approval of
 
00:28:09.990 --> 00:28:10.000 align:start position:0%
joint fiscal or when necessary the
 
00:28:12.230 --> 00:28:12.240 align:start position:0%
governor's counsel we're the legislative
 
00:28:15.149 --> 00:28:15.159 align:start position:0%
branch we need to make sure that the
 
00:28:17.230 --> 00:28:17.240 align:start position:0%
funding is looked at a little bit
 
00:28:20.269 --> 00:28:20.279 align:start position:0%
earlier in the bill too um I neglected
 
00:28:22.190 --> 00:28:22.200 align:start position:0%
to mention this but there is a a
 
00:28:28.190 --> 00:28:28.200 align:start position:0%
sentence here um that says that uh it is
 
00:28:30.950 --> 00:28:30.960 align:start position:0%
the state which is the primary authority
 
00:28:34.149 --> 00:28:34.159 align:start position:0%
over any policy this is not a group to
 
00:28:37.190 --> 00:28:37.200 align:start position:0%
make policy the legislature makes policy
 
00:28:38.710 --> 00:28:38.720 align:start position:0%
so we thought it was important to have
 
00:28:42.350 --> 00:28:42.360 align:start position:0%
in the in this bill that statement that
 
00:28:44.149 --> 00:28:44.159 align:start position:0%
this council is not supposed to go off
 
00:28:46.070 --> 00:28:46.080 align:start position:0%
and create policy for the state it's
 
00:28:47.750 --> 00:28:47.760 align:start position:0%
supposed to advise us and make
 
00:28:50.509 --> 00:28:50.519 align:start position:0%
recommendation to us about what we might
 
00:28:54.190 --> 00:28:54.200 align:start position:0%
want to enact upon their uh
 
00:28:57.190 --> 00:28:57.200 align:start position:0%
experience um so it sets up a fund uh as
 
00:28:58.350 --> 00:28:58.360 align:start position:0%
you'll see here and that's pretty
 
00:29:00.470 --> 00:29:00.480 align:start position:0%
standard language um about how the fund
 
00:29:03.990 --> 00:29:04.000 align:start position:0%
is set up accept funding um if and there
 
00:29:06.630 --> 00:29:06.640 align:start position:0%
is I would just mention um there is a
 
00:29:08.710 --> 00:29:08.720 align:start position:0%
lot of funding right now in the ira bill
 
00:29:10.590 --> 00:29:10.600 align:start position:0%
for this kind of activity um there is
 
00:29:14.750 --> 00:29:14.760 align:start position:0%
substantial funding for um uh
 
00:29:16.590 --> 00:29:16.600 align:start position:0%
agriculture U from the agriculture
 
00:29:18.269 --> 00:29:18.279 align:start position:0%
department for this kind of activity
 
00:29:19.990 --> 00:29:20.000 align:start position:0%
there's substantial funding in homeland
 
00:29:22.190 --> 00:29:22.200 align:start position:0%
security for this kind of activity from
 
00:29:23.149 --> 00:29:23.159 align:start position:0%
the federal government there's
 
00:29:27.029 --> 00:29:27.039 align:start position:0%
substantial funding on Coastal uh and on
 
00:29:30.029 --> 00:29:30.039 align:start position:0%
water projects and uh for transportation
 
00:29:32.350 --> 00:29:32.360 align:start position:0%
so you know I think that this this
 
00:29:35.789 --> 00:29:35.799 align:start position:0%
provides um kind of an an impetus for
 
00:29:37.750 --> 00:29:37.760 align:start position:0%
this group to look to the federal
 
00:29:39.950 --> 00:29:39.960 align:start position:0%
dollars where they can get them uh and
 
00:29:41.789 --> 00:29:41.799 align:start position:0%
bring some of those resources into into
 
00:29:41.799 --> 00:29:42.509 align:start position:0%
bring some of those resources into into
the

00:29:42.509 --> 00:29:42.519 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:29:44.710 --> 00:29:44.720 align:start position:0%
state Mr chairman thank you for
 
00:29:46.750 --> 00:29:46.760 align:start position:0%
indulging me thank you uh for your
 
00:29:49.830 --> 00:29:49.840 align:start position:0%
testimony questions for
 
00:29:52.230 --> 00:29:52.240 align:start position:0%
senator represent clear okay thank you
 
00:29:55.269 --> 00:29:55.279 align:start position:0%
Mr chair do do you in in your opinion
 
00:29:58.470 --> 00:29:58.480 align:start position:0%
and uh do you see this Council
 
00:30:02.029 --> 00:30:02.039 align:start position:0%
as uh trying to coordinate agencies of
 
00:30:05.310 --> 00:30:05.320 align:start position:0%
the executive branch in in responding to
 
00:30:07.430 --> 00:30:07.440 align:start position:0%
to climate change and and also another
 
00:30:09.630 --> 00:30:09.640 align:start position:0%
thing you see it maybe they could issue
 
00:30:11.509 --> 00:30:11.519 align:start position:0%
legis uh recommendation to the
 
00:30:13.389 --> 00:30:13.399 align:start position:0%
legislative branch for consideration of
 
00:30:15.470 --> 00:30:15.480 align:start position:0%
different bills if necessary if they
 
00:30:17.830 --> 00:30:17.840 align:start position:0%
find a problem that they can't work out
 
00:30:19.430 --> 00:30:19.440 align:start position:0%
within the executive
 
00:30:22.190 --> 00:30:22.200 align:start position:0%
branch well thanks for the question and
 
00:30:24.310 --> 00:30:24.320 align:start position:0%
and I agree with a good part of that I
 
00:30:25.710 --> 00:30:25.720 align:start position:0%
think environmental change is something
 
00:30:28.110 --> 00:30:28.120 align:start position:0%
all the agencies are fa are facing and
 
00:30:30.830 --> 00:30:30.840 align:start position:0%
um so two things it lets them say work
 
00:30:33.590 --> 00:30:33.600 align:start position:0%
together work together um we don't
 
00:30:35.269 --> 00:30:35.279 align:start position:0%
really you know since we got rid of the
 
00:30:38.110 --> 00:30:38.120 align:start position:0%
office of U of planning we don't really
 
00:30:40.350 --> 00:30:40.360 align:start position:0%
have this function centralized anymore
 
00:30:41.789 --> 00:30:41.799 align:start position:0%
we peeled off the energy stuff in the
 
00:30:43.990 --> 00:30:44.000 align:start position:0%
department of energy but you know here
 
00:30:45.310 --> 00:30:45.320 align:start position:0%
here's a lot of the rest things they
 
00:30:49.029 --> 00:30:49.039 align:start position:0%
used to do and um uh so I think that
 
00:30:51.590 --> 00:30:51.600 align:start position:0%
that that cross agency will be important
 
00:30:54.549 --> 00:30:54.559 align:start position:0%
um I don't see this Council as saying a
 
00:30:56.909 --> 00:30:56.919 align:start position:0%
a peep about bills that we put in the
 
00:30:58.310 --> 00:30:58.320 align:start position:0%
legislature I think can make
 
00:31:00.350 --> 00:31:00.360 align:start position:0%
recommendations to us but you know the
 
00:31:01.870 --> 00:31:01.880 align:start position:0%
agenc you know it's like the agencies
 
00:31:04.950 --> 00:31:04.960 align:start position:0%
come in and advise us on on bills so I I
 
00:31:06.470 --> 00:31:06.480 align:start position:0%
I I do really want to have a bright line
 
00:31:08.789 --> 00:31:08.799 align:start position:0%
between their being a very practical
 
00:31:11.190 --> 00:31:11.200 align:start position:0%
group that looks at it's a planning
 
00:31:14.470 --> 00:31:14.480 align:start position:0%
exercise and it's a regional and across
 
00:31:17.149 --> 00:31:17.159 align:start position:0%
the state coordination exercise and what
 
00:31:19.470 --> 00:31:19.480 align:start position:0%
comes from that will be potentially
 
00:31:23.110 --> 00:31:23.120 align:start position:0%
advised to us reporting uh uh to us and
 
00:31:26.190 --> 00:31:26.200 align:start position:0%
it's about um you know I really it's
 
00:31:29.310 --> 00:31:29.320 align:start position:0%
environmental MH at a a um other people
 
00:31:32.269 --> 00:31:32.279 align:start position:0%
can worry about you know energy and all
 
00:31:34.470 --> 00:31:34.480 align:start position:0%
that stuff as I said this is about what
 
00:31:35.990 --> 00:31:36.000 align:start position:0%
do we what do we know we got to do to
 
00:31:37.830 --> 00:31:37.840 align:start position:0%
protect the taxpayer and what are we
 
00:31:40.470 --> 00:31:40.480 align:start position:0%
going to look at so and I will add
 
00:31:42.190 --> 00:31:42.200 align:start position:0%
mention as well that I I know the
 
00:31:44.190 --> 00:31:44.200 align:start position:0%
chairman has some ideas about changing
 
00:31:47.029 --> 00:31:47.039 align:start position:0%
some of the language here uh maybe you
 
00:31:50.230 --> 00:31:50.240 align:start position:0%
know some of the composition of the of
 
00:31:52.549 --> 00:31:52.559 align:start position:0%
the of the council and as I said at the
 
00:31:54.190 --> 00:31:54.200 align:start position:0%
start this is a wise committee you know
 
00:31:56.710 --> 00:31:56.720 align:start position:0%
how to do this kind of stuff so the
 
00:31:59.350 --> 00:31:59.360 align:start position:0%
advice that you have will be welcome Mr
 
00:32:01.430 --> 00:32:01.440 align:start position:0%
chair followup please thank you for your
 
00:32:03.870 --> 00:32:03.880 align:start position:0%
compliment uh but you see it sort of
 
00:32:06.190 --> 00:32:06.200 align:start position:0%
more and I just want to be clear I
 
00:32:07.909 --> 00:32:07.919 align:start position:0%
understand sort of coordinating the
 
00:32:11.629 --> 00:32:11.639 align:start position:0%
state's response to our adapting weather
 
00:32:13.230 --> 00:32:13.240 align:start position:0%
CL whatever you call it and I don't want
 
00:32:15.110 --> 00:32:15.120 align:start position:0%
to get into argument about climate
 
00:32:17.509 --> 00:32:17.519 align:start position:0%
change today but are adapting and how
 
00:32:19.750 --> 00:32:19.760 align:start position:0%
are we going to deal with what is
 
00:32:22.110 --> 00:32:22.120 align:start position:0%
happening and may be happening already
 
00:32:24.909 --> 00:32:24.919 align:start position:0%
right a sort of a coordinated response
 
00:32:27.590 --> 00:32:27.600 align:start position:0%
by agencies in the state the executive
 
00:32:29.470 --> 00:32:29.480 align:start position:0%
branch yeah thank you coordination and
 
00:32:31.190 --> 00:32:31.200 align:start position:0%
then individually as they do the
 
00:32:33.669 --> 00:32:33.679 align:start position:0%
planning they already do to add on this
 
00:32:36.110 --> 00:32:36.120 align:start position:0%
layer of let's look to the Future uh
 
00:32:38.190 --> 00:32:38.200 align:start position:0%
with this lens so thank you okay thank
 
00:32:40.430 --> 00:32:40.440 align:start position:0%
you thank you represent
 
00:32:42.710 --> 00:32:42.720 align:start position:0%
bone thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
00:32:46.710 --> 00:32:46.720 align:start position:0%
for taking my question so you've got
 
00:32:51.310 --> 00:32:51.320 align:start position:0%
about 20 people on this Council you meet
 
00:32:53.710 --> 00:32:53.720 align:start position:0%
twice a year and you're going to come up
 
00:32:56.430 --> 00:32:56.440 align:start position:0%
with a report so my question is because
 
00:32:58.789 --> 00:32:58.799 align:start position:0%
I think this is a great idea and because
 
00:33:00.190 --> 00:33:00.200 align:start position:0%
what happens is we've got all these
 
00:33:01.629 --> 00:33:01.639 align:start position:0%
different agencies and we have the
 
00:33:04.789 --> 00:33:04.799 align:start position:0%
problem of what's the the jargon today
 
00:33:06.350 --> 00:33:06.360 align:start position:0%
is silos everyone's working
 
00:33:08.230 --> 00:33:08.240 align:start position:0%
independently of each other they all see
 
00:33:10.070 --> 00:33:10.080 align:start position:0%
the problem in the same with their own
 
00:33:12.509 --> 00:33:12.519 align:start position:0%
narrow interests and so this is a group
 
00:33:14.350 --> 00:33:14.360 align:start position:0%
that's going to step back and say okay
 
00:33:16.389 --> 00:33:16.399 align:start position:0%
let's take a a holistic look at the
 
00:33:18.870 --> 00:33:18.880 align:start position:0%
state which I think is a really good
 
00:33:22.070 --> 00:33:22.080 align:start position:0%
idea I'm just wondering how I mean
 
00:33:24.149 --> 00:33:24.159 align:start position:0%
functionally who's going to ride Herd on
 
00:33:25.870 --> 00:33:25.880 align:start position:0%
this group so basically who's going to
 
00:33:27.430 --> 00:33:27.440 align:start position:0%
basically to make sure that the group
 
00:33:27.440 --> 00:33:28.590 align:start position:0%
basically to make sure that the group
meets

00:33:28.590 --> 00:33:28.600 align:start position:0%
meets
 
00:33:30.549 --> 00:33:30.559 align:start position:0%
and is there so how does the the
 
00:33:32.549 --> 00:33:32.559 align:start position:0%
operation of the council
 
00:33:35.070 --> 00:33:35.080 align:start position:0%
work thank you for the for the question
 
00:33:35.080 --> 00:33:36.350 align:start position:0%
work thank you for the for the question
and

00:33:36.350 --> 00:33:36.360 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:33:38.669 --> 00:33:38.679 align:start position:0%
um the language you see here is the
 
00:33:40.110 --> 00:33:40.120 align:start position:0%
result of a lot of conversation with
 
00:33:43.070 --> 00:33:43.080 align:start position:0%
Dees and the anxieties about putting a
 
00:33:45.629 --> 00:33:45.639 align:start position:0%
burden on staff that they may or may not
 
00:33:49.789 --> 00:33:49.799 align:start position:0%
have um it can meet more than twice a
 
00:33:53.190 --> 00:33:53.200 align:start position:0%
year I think functionally it will again
 
00:33:54.950 --> 00:33:54.960 align:start position:0%
the example of the cised hazard
 
00:33:57.950 --> 00:33:57.960 align:start position:0%
commission that what we did there was to
 
00:33:59.110 --> 00:33:59.120 align:start position:0%
break into
 
00:34:01.190 --> 00:34:01.200 align:start position:0%
subgroups and to say that there were
 
00:34:02.909 --> 00:34:02.919 align:start position:0%
subgroups to go off and work on a
 
00:34:04.350 --> 00:34:04.360 align:start position:0%
particular area where it seemed to make
 
00:34:07.149 --> 00:34:07.159 align:start position:0%
sense you know to come come together uh
 
00:34:08.629 --> 00:34:08.639 align:start position:0%
and that they could do a lot of the work
 
00:34:10.389 --> 00:34:10.399 align:start position:0%
and that what what would happen is that
 
00:34:11.990 --> 00:34:12.000 align:start position:0%
then they would come together at least
 
00:34:14.430 --> 00:34:14.440 align:start position:0%
twice a year to receive those kinds of
 
00:34:17.030 --> 00:34:17.040 align:start position:0%
reports and so forth this group I mean I
 
00:34:20.069 --> 00:34:20.079 align:start position:0%
I really I mean we have fabulous State
 
00:34:22.030 --> 00:34:22.040 align:start position:0%
Commissioners and agency heads right you
 
00:34:23.589 --> 00:34:23.599 align:start position:0%
know I mean these people are doing are
 
00:34:26.030 --> 00:34:26.040 align:start position:0%
doing great jobs and I think they'll get
 
00:34:27.669 --> 00:34:27.679 align:start position:0%
together they'll elect some leaders
 
00:34:29.909 --> 00:34:29.919 align:start position:0%
leadership they'll set a meeting
 
00:34:31.909 --> 00:34:31.919 align:start position:0%
schedule um I think they are going to
 
00:34:34.230 --> 00:34:34.240 align:start position:0%
get a lot of help from folks and from
 
00:34:36.750 --> 00:34:36.760 align:start position:0%
Grants and from the nonprofits to help
 
00:34:39.109 --> 00:34:39.119 align:start position:0%
them U you know take care of some staff
 
00:34:41.310 --> 00:34:41.320 align:start position:0%
functions for this so I think it'll work
 
00:34:41.320 --> 00:34:43.510 align:start position:0%
functions for this so I think it'll work
um

00:34:43.510 --> 00:34:43.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:34:45.869 --> 00:34:45.879 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you and and thank you for
 
00:34:47.950 --> 00:34:47.960 align:start position:0%
that answer so so pretty much so so you
 
00:34:50.389 --> 00:34:50.399 align:start position:0%
see Dees as taking the lead in this that
 
00:34:52.869 --> 00:34:52.879 align:start position:0%
the way the Bill's written to get things
 
00:34:55.190 --> 00:34:55.200 align:start position:0%
started is that correct thanks for the
 
00:34:57.910 --> 00:34:57.920 align:start position:0%
question they'll call the first meeting
 
00:35:00.510 --> 00:35:00.520 align:start position:0%
um and then the uh you'll see the
 
00:35:02.550 --> 00:35:02.560 align:start position:0%
council can elect a chair or
 
00:35:04.990 --> 00:35:05.000 align:start position:0%
co-chairs so uh I had a lot of
 
00:35:06.430 --> 00:35:06.440 align:start position:0%
discussion with you know maybe it makes
 
00:35:09.150 --> 00:35:09.160 align:start position:0%
sense if Dees and HHS it's co-chairs and
 
00:35:11.670 --> 00:35:11.680 align:start position:0%
H says well you know maybe maybe not but
 
00:35:13.870 --> 00:35:13.880 align:start position:0%
that's something they can uh work out
 
00:35:15.910 --> 00:35:15.920 align:start position:0%
about how they're going to organize um
 
00:35:17.589 --> 00:35:17.599 align:start position:0%
themselves and they're good at this and
 
00:35:19.550 --> 00:35:19.560 align:start position:0%
I I just didn't you know Dees obviously
 
00:35:20.950 --> 00:35:20.960 align:start position:0%
is going to have a lot to do with this
 
00:35:23.630 --> 00:35:23.640 align:start position:0%
but I did not want to force a
 
00:35:26.710 --> 00:35:26.720 align:start position:0%
commitment no fysical note in the bill I
 
00:35:29.030 --> 00:35:29.040 align:start position:0%
wanted them to be able to get started
 
00:35:30.230 --> 00:35:30.240 align:start position:0%
and then they all going to look at their
 
00:35:32.069 --> 00:35:32.079 align:start position:0%
budgets and the grants that I think will
 
00:35:34.310 --> 00:35:34.320 align:start position:0%
come in in the next year so so they'll
 
00:35:36.710 --> 00:35:36.720 align:start position:0%
be able to you know figure out what they
 
00:35:38.790 --> 00:35:38.800 align:start position:0%
can do on that so
 
00:35:41.990 --> 00:35:42.000 align:start position:0%
I you know I if I could M wave a magic
 
00:35:45.630 --> 00:35:45.640 align:start position:0%
wand and uh you know strike gold
 
00:35:47.230 --> 00:35:47.240 align:start position:0%
somewhere but I I think you know we do
 
00:35:48.670 --> 00:35:48.680 align:start position:0%
things frugally in the state right we
 
00:35:50.550 --> 00:35:50.560 align:start position:0%
get together we we work together and
 
00:35:53.470 --> 00:35:53.480 align:start position:0%
this is this encourages that thank you
 
00:35:55.829 --> 00:35:55.839 align:start position:0%
thank you repent pulner D question thank
 
00:35:57.870 --> 00:35:57.880 align:start position:0%
you I think you may have yeah address
 
00:35:59.710 --> 00:35:59.720 align:start position:0%
this question but to what extent uh
 
00:36:03.150 --> 00:36:03.160 align:start position:0%
would it be possible or or advisable to
 
00:36:05.990 --> 00:36:06.000 align:start position:0%
have this group hire an outside agency
 
00:36:08.630 --> 00:36:08.640 align:start position:0%
outside firm to produce some of the
 
00:36:10.710 --> 00:36:10.720 align:start position:0%
technical information and then possibly
 
00:36:12.750 --> 00:36:12.760 align:start position:0%
report is that within the
 
00:36:16.589 --> 00:36:16.599 align:start position:0%
scope thanks for the um for the question
 
00:36:18.870 --> 00:36:18.880 align:start position:0%
um I think that there is going to be an
 
00:36:20.910 --> 00:36:20.920 align:start position:0%
opportunity um that's why I had the the
 
00:36:22.870 --> 00:36:22.880 align:start position:0%
state climatologist and Mary STP point I
 
00:36:24.069 --> 00:36:24.079 align:start position:0%
think there's in the mapping I think
 
00:36:26.109 --> 00:36:26.119 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of existing information
 
00:36:30.069 --> 00:36:30.079 align:start position:0%
here that can be provided to it um and
 
00:36:32.030 --> 00:36:32.040 align:start position:0%
uh in terms
 
00:36:35.309 --> 00:36:35.319 align:start position:0%
of the capacity to have if they're you
 
00:36:37.510 --> 00:36:37.520 align:start position:0%
know to help have some help there I do
 
00:36:39.270 --> 00:36:39.280 align:start position:0%
think some of the nonprofits are willing
 
00:36:41.990 --> 00:36:42.000 align:start position:0%
to undertake some fundraising to help
 
00:36:45.589 --> 00:36:45.599 align:start position:0%
with that what I think makes the most
 
00:36:48.230 --> 00:36:48.240 align:start position:0%
sense though is that for the agencies
 
00:36:49.950 --> 00:36:49.960 align:start position:0%
involved here and I mentioned several
 
00:36:52.750 --> 00:36:52.760 align:start position:0%
that you know do do planning and you
 
00:36:54.710 --> 00:36:54.720 align:start position:0%
know regularly most of them do but that
 
00:36:56.550 --> 00:36:56.560 align:start position:0%
are more particularly related to this
 
00:36:57.910 --> 00:36:57.920 align:start position:0%
they'll have an opportunity the way the
 
00:36:58.790 --> 00:36:58.800 align:start position:0%
bill is
 
00:37:01.190 --> 00:37:01.200 align:start position:0%
structured in their budget presentations
 
00:37:03.550 --> 00:37:03.560 align:start position:0%
to the governor and when we all the
 
00:37:05.910 --> 00:37:05.920 align:start position:0%
budget next year if they decide that
 
00:37:09.109 --> 00:37:09.119 align:start position:0%
they think that they could play a the
 
00:37:11.150 --> 00:37:11.160 align:start position:0%
their role in this or just in planning
 
00:37:13.630 --> 00:37:13.640 align:start position:0%
in general could use some financial
 
00:37:15.390 --> 00:37:15.400 align:start position:0%
support that's the budget process again
 
00:37:17.870 --> 00:37:17.880 align:start position:0%
it's in the legislature which is where
 
00:37:19.270 --> 00:37:19.280 align:start position:0%
where it belongs so I think there's a
 
00:37:22.150 --> 00:37:22.160 align:start position:0%
lot of possibilities and um I think
 
00:37:24.829 --> 00:37:24.839 align:start position:0%
we'll get it done thank you further
 
00:37:28.190 --> 00:37:28.200 align:start position:0%
questions uh yes orim mels
 
00:37:29.270 --> 00:37:29.280 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
00:37:30.990 --> 00:37:31.000 align:start position:0%
taking my question this is purely
 
00:37:35.069 --> 00:37:35.079 align:start position:0%
mechanical now yeah um as far as funds
 
00:37:38.190 --> 00:37:38.200 align:start position:0%
ex expenditure funds may be expended
 
00:37:40.430 --> 00:37:40.440 align:start position:0%
upon the recommendation of the council
 
00:37:42.510 --> 00:37:42.520 align:start position:0%
and I heard you un I understood
 
00:37:44.309 --> 00:37:44.319 align:start position:0%
correctly this the legislation is going
 
00:37:47.589 --> 00:37:47.599 align:start position:0%
to have a big part in it also so my
 
00:37:50.270 --> 00:37:50.280 align:start position:0%
mechanical question is let's just say
 
00:37:52.510 --> 00:37:52.520 align:start position:0%
the the council decides that they have
 
00:37:55.390 --> 00:37:55.400 align:start position:0%
to spend x amount they want to recommend
 
00:37:58.750 --> 00:37:58.760 align:start position:0%
x amount of dollars be spent on Pro B
 
00:38:00.349 --> 00:38:00.359 align:start position:0%
and they take it to the joint physical
 
00:38:01.829 --> 00:38:01.839 align:start position:0%
committee and the phisical committee
 
00:38:05.069 --> 00:38:05.079 align:start position:0%
says yes great it's a great
 
00:38:07.950 --> 00:38:07.960 align:start position:0%
idea is that good enough for approval
 
00:38:11.990 --> 00:38:12.000 align:start position:0%
for this particular project or does this
 
00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:13.270 align:start position:0%
for this particular project or does this
mechanically

00:38:13.270 --> 00:38:13.280 align:start position:0%
mechanically
 
00:38:16.589 --> 00:38:16.599 align:start position:0%
require a a bill to come through the
 
00:38:19.670 --> 00:38:19.680 align:start position:0%
legislature that says you've got to take
 
00:38:21.910 --> 00:38:21.920 align:start position:0%
x amount of dollars for Project B and
 
00:38:24.790 --> 00:38:24.800 align:start position:0%
it's already been preapproved yeah so so
 
00:38:27.069 --> 00:38:27.079 align:start position:0%
nothing is going to be expended directly
 
00:38:28.910 --> 00:38:28.920 align:start position:0%
through the council it'll have to come
 
00:38:31.030 --> 00:38:31.040 align:start position:0%
through the legislature thanks for the
 
00:38:33.109 --> 00:38:33.119 align:start position:0%
question and um the way I've imagined it
 
00:38:38.309 --> 00:38:38.319 align:start position:0%
is that um the language here is uh joint
 
00:38:41.790 --> 00:38:41.800 align:start position:0%
physical which is the legislature um but
 
00:38:44.109 --> 00:38:44.119 align:start position:0%
that is a process for so if funds come
 
00:38:45.230 --> 00:38:45.240 align:start position:0%
in from
 
00:38:47.670 --> 00:38:47.680 align:start position:0%
Grants so they have funding it's not
 
00:38:50.109 --> 00:38:50.119 align:start position:0%
asking for new state appropriation right
 
00:38:51.550 --> 00:38:51.560 align:start position:0%
okay so it's funding comes in through
 
00:38:53.829 --> 00:38:53.839 align:start position:0%
grants either to the agency or into this
 
00:38:56.309 --> 00:38:56.319 align:start position:0%
fund they have to go to join fiscal and
 
00:38:58.030 --> 00:38:58.040 align:start position:0%
then of course it's a contract cont ract
 
00:38:59.670 --> 00:38:59.680 align:start position:0%
it's got to go to the governor counsel
 
00:39:03.670 --> 00:39:03.680 align:start position:0%
right if they want to ask in the for a
 
00:39:06.190 --> 00:39:06.200 align:start position:0%
budget you know a general fund
 
00:39:08.510 --> 00:39:08.520 align:start position:0%
appropriation expenditure that's got to
 
00:39:08.520 --> 00:39:09.309 align:start position:0%
appropriation expenditure that's got to
go

00:39:09.309 --> 00:39:09.319 align:start position:0%
go
 
00:39:11.790 --> 00:39:11.800 align:start position:0%
through a bill or the budget process
 
00:39:13.670 --> 00:39:13.680 align:start position:0%
right so correct the language here is
 
00:39:15.790 --> 00:39:15.800 align:start position:0%
particularly around the creation of that
 
00:39:18.150 --> 00:39:18.160 align:start position:0%
fund how you going to feed it how you
 
00:39:19.990 --> 00:39:20.000 align:start position:0%
going to take money out of it they can
 
00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:20.910 align:start position:0%
going to take money out of it they can
make

00:39:20.910 --> 00:39:20.920 align:start position:0%
make
 
00:39:23.069 --> 00:39:23.079 align:start position:0%
recommendations that say hey we go we
 
00:39:24.750 --> 00:39:24.760 align:start position:0%
just we just got $100,000 Grant from the
 
00:39:26.150 --> 00:39:26.160 align:start position:0%
feds we'd like to use it for this
 
00:39:27.990 --> 00:39:28.000 align:start position:0%
planning activity
 
00:39:30.870 --> 00:39:30.880 align:start position:0%
um but they can't write the check it
 
00:39:32.670 --> 00:39:32.680 align:start position:0%
would have to go through joint fiscal
 
00:39:35.109 --> 00:39:35.119 align:start position:0%
and as appropriate to the U executive
 
00:39:37.829 --> 00:39:37.839 align:start position:0%
Council so thank you s yeah but I mean
 
00:39:39.069 --> 00:39:39.079 align:start position:0%
you know if you think that language need
 
00:39:40.870 --> 00:39:40.880 align:start position:0%
to be typ up typen up or changed to
 
00:39:40.880 --> 00:39:45.309 align:start position:0%

00:40:17.270 --> 00:40:17.280 align:start position:0%
chair thank you very much uh for the
 
00:40:19.990 --> 00:40:20.000 align:start position:0%
record my name is Ted deers and I am the
 
00:40:21.950 --> 00:40:21.960 align:start position:0%
assistant director of The Water Division
 
00:40:23.630 --> 00:40:23.640 align:start position:0%
at the New Hampshire Department of
 
00:40:25.589 --> 00:40:25.599 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services and it's a
 
00:40:26.870 --> 00:40:26.880 align:start position:0%
tremendous pleasure to be in front of
 
00:40:29.589 --> 00:40:29.599 align:start position:0%
you here today so uh been certainly
 
00:40:31.430 --> 00:40:31.440 align:start position:0%
working with uh Senator waters on this
 
00:40:33.990 --> 00:40:34.000 align:start position:0%
bill now for several months as well as
 
00:40:36.109 --> 00:40:36.119 align:start position:0%
with the other agencies and I would like
 
00:40:38.510 --> 00:40:38.520 align:start position:0%
to just do a couple of things today um
 
00:40:40.390 --> 00:40:40.400 align:start position:0%
one is to say first of all that the
 
00:40:42.069 --> 00:40:42.079 align:start position:0%
changes that were made as amended
 
00:40:43.990 --> 00:40:44.000 align:start position:0%
through the Senate um made this bill
 
00:40:46.630 --> 00:40:46.640 align:start position:0%
much more palatable um we had a lot of
 
00:40:48.829 --> 00:40:48.839 align:start position:0%
concerns originally about the amount of
 
00:40:51.390 --> 00:40:51.400 align:start position:0%
uh Dees staff time that this would take
 
00:40:52.550 --> 00:40:52.560 align:start position:0%
and I would just say that I've been with
 
00:40:55.309 --> 00:40:55.319 align:start position:0%
the state for 27 and A2 years and then
 
00:40:58.430 --> 00:40:58.440 align:start position:0%
in that time I've never seen around me
 
00:41:01.109 --> 00:41:01.119 align:start position:0%
every single person being at or Beyond
 
00:41:03.950 --> 00:41:03.960 align:start position:0%
capacity uh as we are today uh there's a
 
00:41:06.030 --> 00:41:06.040 align:start position:0%
lot of reasons for that but it is um
 
00:41:07.630 --> 00:41:07.640 align:start position:0%
right now that that you know all staff
 
00:41:09.710 --> 00:41:09.720 align:start position:0%
time is a concern so that's uh one of
 
00:41:11.910 --> 00:41:11.920 align:start position:0%
the concerns that was addressed I was
 
00:41:13.470 --> 00:41:13.480 align:start position:0%
also concerned that this was a
 
00:41:16.349 --> 00:41:16.359 align:start position:0%
NeverEnding uh proposition um and so
 
00:41:18.069 --> 00:41:18.079 align:start position:0%
you'll see that it also does have sort
 
00:41:20.309 --> 00:41:20.319 align:start position:0%
of a beginning a middle and an end and I
 
00:41:22.710 --> 00:41:22.720 align:start position:0%
think that that's important um to this
 
00:41:25.349 --> 00:41:25.359 align:start position:0%
uh to this effort it's also an
 
00:41:27.390 --> 00:41:27.400 align:start position:0%
opportunity for me to brag a little bit
 
00:41:28.870 --> 00:41:28.880 align:start position:0%
about some of the great work that Dees
 
00:41:32.109 --> 00:41:32.119 align:start position:0%
is doing uh we are um you know I think
 
00:41:33.630 --> 00:41:33.640 align:start position:0%
that we're doing a full court press at
 
00:41:35.270 --> 00:41:35.280 align:start position:0%
this moment on all of the kinds of
 
00:41:37.870 --> 00:41:37.880 align:start position:0%
issues that have been discussed here we
 
00:41:39.790 --> 00:41:39.800 align:start position:0%
on our Sea Coast Area we've been doing
 
00:41:41.670 --> 00:41:41.680 align:start position:0%
this for a very long time because those
 
00:41:43.829 --> 00:41:43.839 align:start position:0%
are the places that are both flat so you
 
00:41:45.990 --> 00:41:46.000 align:start position:0%
get lots of issues with precipitation
 
00:41:47.630 --> 00:41:47.640 align:start position:0%
and they bump up against the ocean and
 
00:41:49.589 --> 00:41:49.599 align:start position:0%
the ocean's coming up to get us so we
 
00:41:50.950 --> 00:41:50.960 align:start position:0%
got the mountains coming down and we got
 
00:41:53.109 --> 00:41:53.119 align:start position:0%
the ocean coming up and uh you know
 
00:41:55.430 --> 00:41:55.440 align:start position:0%
that's a challenge in our Sea Coast so
 
00:41:56.550 --> 00:41:56.560 align:start position:0%
that's certainly the place where we've
 
00:41:58.870 --> 00:41:58.880 align:start position:0%
done a ton of of stuff we recently
 
00:42:00.990 --> 00:42:01.000 align:start position:0%
funded uh the state climatologist to
 
00:42:02.510 --> 00:42:02.520 align:start position:0%
take some of the good work that had been
 
00:42:05.510 --> 00:42:05.520 align:start position:0%
done looking at what are the potential
 
00:42:07.230 --> 00:42:07.240 align:start position:0%
uh environmental hazards that we may be
 
00:42:09.510 --> 00:42:09.520 align:start position:0%
facing in the future from just the Sea
 
00:42:11.510 --> 00:42:11.520 align:start position:0%
Coast to Statewide so there's a really
 
00:42:13.309 --> 00:42:13.319 align:start position:0%
good report that was just created by the
 
00:42:15.589 --> 00:42:15.599 align:start position:0%
state climatologist that takes those
 
00:42:17.710 --> 00:42:17.720 align:start position:0%
those models downscales them across the
 
00:42:20.150 --> 00:42:20.160 align:start position:0%
state and we are able to understand what
 
00:42:22.030 --> 00:42:22.040 align:start position:0%
some of those impacts are from from
 
00:42:26.270 --> 00:42:26.280 align:start position:0%
Berlin to to Handover uh to uh to Keane
 
00:42:29.190 --> 00:42:29.200 align:start position:0%
uh and and everywhere in between so that
 
00:42:30.349 --> 00:42:30.359 align:start position:0%
that's a good rhyme I'm going to put
 
00:42:33.670 --> 00:42:33.680 align:start position:0%
that in a song uh one of these days
 
00:42:36.030 --> 00:42:36.040 align:start position:0%
um a couple of other things going on
 
00:42:37.870 --> 00:42:37.880 align:start position:0%
that that you may not know about we uh
 
00:42:40.150 --> 00:42:40.160 align:start position:0%
have recently hired two people in our
 
00:42:42.470 --> 00:42:42.480 align:start position:0%
drinking water and wastewater programs
 
00:42:44.069 --> 00:42:44.079 align:start position:0%
uh that are looking specifically at
 
00:42:46.309 --> 00:42:46.319 align:start position:0%
doing vulnerability assessments of our
 
00:42:48.549 --> 00:42:48.559 align:start position:0%
water our clean and and drink uh clean
 
00:42:50.910 --> 00:42:50.920 align:start position:0%
water sewer uh infrastructure as well as
 
00:42:52.349 --> 00:42:52.359 align:start position:0%
the drinking water infrastructure and
 
00:42:54.589 --> 00:42:54.599 align:start position:0%
storm water infrastructure so that's all
 
00:42:56.150 --> 00:42:56.160 align:start position:0%
kind of going on right now so they're
 
00:42:59.190 --> 00:42:59.200 align:start position:0%
working directly with uh FEMA programs
 
00:43:00.790 --> 00:43:00.800 align:start position:0%
as well as with those particular
 
00:43:03.630 --> 00:43:03.640 align:start position:0%
communities and water suppliers on
 
00:43:05.470 --> 00:43:05.480 align:start position:0%
making sure that what they are doing
 
00:43:08.870 --> 00:43:08.880 align:start position:0%
will be uh less vulnerable to Future
 
00:43:11.750 --> 00:43:11.760 align:start position:0%
impacts uh whether it be energy shocks
 
00:43:14.510 --> 00:43:14.520 align:start position:0%
uh that is for pricing or it be uh the
 
00:43:16.870 --> 00:43:16.880 align:start position:0%
you know floods or other kinds of things
 
00:43:19.710 --> 00:43:19.720 align:start position:0%
also today we launched uh a new study
 
00:43:22.109 --> 00:43:22.119 align:start position:0%
looking at emergency interconnectedness
 
00:43:25.390 --> 00:43:25.400 align:start position:0%
of our Sea Coast uh water supplies so
 
00:43:26.910 --> 00:43:26.920 align:start position:0%
this is all the communities in the Sea
 
00:43:28.750 --> 00:43:28.760 align:start position:0%
Coast participating through a consulting
 
00:43:31.549 --> 00:43:31.559 align:start position:0%
firm uh that we're going to look at how
 
00:43:33.510 --> 00:43:33.520 align:start position:0%
would we provide for water during
 
00:43:35.470 --> 00:43:35.480 align:start position:0%
emergencies that could happen in a
 
00:43:37.309 --> 00:43:37.319 align:start position:0%
particular Community this is
 
00:43:40.190 --> 00:43:40.200 align:start position:0%
extraordinarily important work as we see
 
00:43:41.870 --> 00:43:41.880 align:start position:0%
more and more of these kinds of issues
 
00:43:44.870 --> 00:43:44.880 align:start position:0%
come up so that's really key uh we have
 
00:43:47.190 --> 00:43:47.200 align:start position:0%
AR arpa funds that we recently put $6
 
00:43:50.630 --> 00:43:50.640 align:start position:0%
million towards uh Statewide culverts so
 
00:43:52.030 --> 00:43:52.040 align:start position:0%
we have Culver scaling in across the
 
00:43:53.950 --> 00:43:53.960 align:start position:0%
state to upssize those culs to handle
 
00:43:56.230 --> 00:43:56.240 align:start position:0%
increased flow we have a project that's
 
00:43:57.390 --> 00:43:57.400 align:start position:0%
going to be in front of govern and
 
00:44:00.349 --> 00:44:00.359 align:start position:0%
Council on next Wednesday in uh the
 
00:44:03.230 --> 00:44:03.240 align:start position:0%
community of South aworth um which is a
 
00:44:05.190 --> 00:44:05.200 align:start position:0%
lovely spot if you've been there there's
 
00:44:06.829 --> 00:44:06.839 align:start position:0%
a brook there that is completely
 
00:44:09.109 --> 00:44:09.119 align:start position:0%
unraveled and is coming out of its banks
 
00:44:12.190 --> 00:44:12.200 align:start position:0%
and trying to wash out a DOT uh Culvert
 
00:44:14.470 --> 00:44:14.480 align:start position:0%
as well as the General Store uh that is
 
00:44:16.630 --> 00:44:16.640 align:start position:0%
in South aworth which is by the way run
 
00:44:18.950 --> 00:44:18.960 align:start position:0%
by the community itself uh by volunteers
 
00:44:21.990 --> 00:44:22.000 align:start position:0%
it's pretty spectacular great sandwiches
 
00:44:26.589 --> 00:44:26.599 align:start position:0%
um and um so we have a lot going on and
 
00:44:28.309 --> 00:44:28.319 align:start position:0%
we also working closely with Dot in the
 
00:44:30.309 --> 00:44:30.319 align:start position:0%
Sea Coast uh looking at culverts and
 
00:44:32.390 --> 00:44:32.400 align:start position:0%
looking at Route 1A and understanding
 
00:44:33.829 --> 00:44:33.839 align:start position:0%
what's going to be happening with both
 
00:44:36.470 --> 00:44:36.480 align:start position:0%
salt marsh the natural side as with as
 
00:44:38.549 --> 00:44:38.559 align:start position:0%
well as with the infrastructure itself
 
00:44:41.349 --> 00:44:41.359 align:start position:0%
so we have a lot going on um I could go
 
00:44:42.950 --> 00:44:42.960 align:start position:0%
on and on about all the different work
 
00:44:45.030 --> 00:44:45.040 align:start position:0%
that is going on right now and there's a
 
00:44:46.790 --> 00:44:46.800 align:start position:0%
lot of funding out there so I think that
 
00:44:50.309 --> 00:44:50.319 align:start position:0%
that is important so um I would just uh
 
00:44:52.230 --> 00:44:52.240 align:start position:0%
end saying that I think that Dees is
 
00:44:55.750 --> 00:44:55.760 align:start position:0%
certainly uh capable of you know hosting
 
00:44:58.589 --> 00:44:58.599 align:start position:0%
the first meeting um and uh and
 
00:45:00.230 --> 00:45:00.240 align:start position:0%
launching this sort of thing we if
 
00:45:02.710 --> 00:45:02.720 align:start position:0%
that's uh your wish uh we certainly are
 
00:45:04.230 --> 00:45:04.240 align:start position:0%
capable of doing that and we would bring
 
00:45:06.750 --> 00:45:06.760 align:start position:0%
the information that we have to whatever
 
00:45:09.150 --> 00:45:09.160 align:start position:0%
kind of council is set up um you know
 
00:45:10.430 --> 00:45:10.440 align:start position:0%
obviously we'd love to share the
 
00:45:12.750 --> 00:45:12.760 align:start position:0%
information that we would have other
 
00:45:15.109 --> 00:45:15.119 align:start position:0%
than that I would be just um willing to
 
00:45:16.790 --> 00:45:16.800 align:start position:0%
you know answer any questions that that
 
00:45:19.750 --> 00:45:19.760 align:start position:0%
you might have for us and um then we can
 
00:45:22.470 --> 00:45:22.480 align:start position:0%
chat further thank you thank you
 
00:45:22.480 --> 00:45:24.109 align:start position:0%
chat further thank you thank you
Commissioners

00:45:24.109 --> 00:45:24.119 align:start position:0%
Commissioners
 
00:45:27.589 --> 00:45:27.599 align:start position:0%
um yes reper please
 
00:45:29.549 --> 00:45:29.559 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
00:45:32.109 --> 00:45:32.119 align:start position:0%
uh taking my comment a question I might
 
00:45:36.510 --> 00:45:36.520 align:start position:0%
be a do you believe thing but um the SE
 
00:45:39.829 --> 00:45:39.839 align:start position:0%
Coast drinking water uh commission um is
 
00:45:42.710 --> 00:45:42.720 align:start position:0%
the one that worked on the uh the issue
 
00:45:44.710 --> 00:45:44.720 align:start position:0%
you just mentioned and I'm surprised in
 
00:45:47.150 --> 00:45:47.160 align:start position:0%
some ways you didn't tie that in because
 
00:45:49.069 --> 00:45:49.079 align:start position:0%
this that commission is the one that
 
00:45:51.109 --> 00:45:51.119 align:start position:0%
ended up generating you know the work
 
00:45:52.710 --> 00:45:52.720 align:start position:0%
that's being done right right and I
 
00:45:54.589 --> 00:45:54.599 align:start position:0%

00:45:57.270 --> 00:45:57.280 align:start position:0%
yeah and um you know Brendan k and it's
 
00:46:00.390 --> 00:46:00.400 align:start position:0%
just unbelievable uh you know helping uh
 
00:46:01.950 --> 00:46:01.960 align:start position:0%
and guiding that and we're getting ready
 
00:46:04.109 --> 00:46:04.119 align:start position:0%
to have a meeting soon but I just wanted
 
00:46:06.109 --> 00:46:06.119 align:start position:0%
to mention that cuz it is so positive
 
00:46:08.109 --> 00:46:08.119 align:start position:0%
thank you absolutely and I I I was I was
 
00:46:09.589 --> 00:46:09.599 align:start position:0%
remiss in not mentioning that that
 
00:46:12.510 --> 00:46:12.520 align:start position:0%
committee is has a a full work plan uh
 
00:46:14.950 --> 00:46:14.960 align:start position:0%
that incorporates you know a lot of
 
00:46:16.790 --> 00:46:16.800 align:start position:0%
different aspects I think that cross
 
00:46:18.190 --> 00:46:18.200 align:start position:0%
some of the things that have been talked
 
00:46:20.270 --> 00:46:20.280 align:start position:0%
about here from public health to
 
00:46:23.349 --> 00:46:23.359 align:start position:0%
contamination issues to um you know
 
00:46:25.510 --> 00:46:25.520 align:start position:0%
natural disasters so that that all I
 
00:46:27.390 --> 00:46:27.400 align:start position:0%
think is Incorporated in the the great
 
00:46:29.109 --> 00:46:29.119 align:start position:0%
work and that's a great commission we're
 
00:46:30.589 --> 00:46:30.599 align:start position:0%
enjoying working with them so thank you
 
00:46:34.030 --> 00:46:34.040 align:start position:0%
for bringing that up thank you represent
 
00:46:36.230 --> 00:46:36.240 align:start position:0%
balone thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
00:46:38.589 --> 00:46:38.599 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question so in the
 
00:46:40.910 --> 00:46:40.920 align:start position:0%
letter uh from commissioner Scott
 
00:46:42.950 --> 00:46:42.960 align:start position:0%
there's a a line that says we believe
 
00:46:45.910 --> 00:46:45.920 align:start position:0%
that a a position would be needed to
 
00:46:48.069 --> 00:46:48.079 align:start position:0%
staff the effort it's right about in the
 
00:46:51.349 --> 00:46:51.359 align:start position:0%
middle of that so can you kind of Flesh
 
00:46:53.150 --> 00:46:53.160 align:start position:0%
that out what what what do you think
 
00:46:55.390 --> 00:46:55.400 align:start position:0%
that is it a position that Dees would
 
00:46:56.430 --> 00:46:56.440 align:start position:0%
because I think You' talked about being
 
00:46:59.030 --> 00:46:59.040 align:start position:0%
stretched as it right thank you for the
 
00:47:00.910 --> 00:47:00.920 align:start position:0%
question and I think that um you know we
 
00:47:04.069 --> 00:47:04.079 align:start position:0%
don't need to have uh for this effort
 
00:47:06.069 --> 00:47:06.079 align:start position:0%
it's an important effort Dees doesn't
 
00:47:08.670 --> 00:47:08.680 align:start position:0%
need to own it so I I think our hope and
 
00:47:10.630 --> 00:47:10.640 align:start position:0%
this is what I think Senator uh Waters
 
00:47:12.150 --> 00:47:12.160 align:start position:0%
was talking about and what I think has
 
00:47:13.589 --> 00:47:13.599 align:start position:0%
been the discussion over the last few
 
00:47:15.829 --> 00:47:15.839 align:start position:0%
months is that other parties could step
 
00:47:18.069 --> 00:47:18.079 align:start position:0%
up finding resources to bring some
 
00:47:20.069 --> 00:47:20.079 align:start position:0%
staffing to Bear our experience the only
 
00:47:21.510 --> 00:47:21.520 align:start position:0%
reason we say that is that our
 
00:47:22.950 --> 00:47:22.960 align:start position:0%
experience with these sorts of
 
00:47:25.470 --> 00:47:25.480 align:start position:0%
committees and these sorts of councils
 
00:47:27.950 --> 00:47:27.960 align:start position:0%
is that if you can have someone in a
 
00:47:30.109 --> 00:47:30.119 align:start position:0%
coordinating position who's not sitting
 
00:47:32.230 --> 00:47:32.240 align:start position:0%
on the committee that is that you know
 
00:47:33.790 --> 00:47:33.800 align:start position:0%
not the actual member who's sitting on
 
00:47:35.430 --> 00:47:35.440 align:start position:0%
the committee it doesn't really matter
 
00:47:37.670 --> 00:47:37.680 align:start position:0%
what agency that's in but having someone
 
00:47:39.950 --> 00:47:39.960 align:start position:0%
who can help to coordinate will do
 
00:47:41.430 --> 00:47:41.440 align:start position:0%
exactly I think the question came up
 
00:47:43.030 --> 00:47:43.040 align:start position:0%
about what can you get done doing two
 
00:47:45.870 --> 00:47:45.880 align:start position:0%
meetings a year it's having that set of
 
00:47:47.990 --> 00:47:48.000 align:start position:0%
resources to be able to make sure that
 
00:47:49.710 --> 00:47:49.720 align:start position:0%
you have continuity from meeting to
 
00:47:51.589 --> 00:47:51.599 align:start position:0%
meeting if there's subcommittees
 
00:47:53.109 --> 00:47:53.119 align:start position:0%
tracking The Works of those
 
00:47:55.910 --> 00:47:55.920 align:start position:0%
subcommittees um so I think that's what
 
00:47:57.630 --> 00:47:57.640 align:start position:0%
one of the it was a recommendation that
 
00:47:59.589 --> 00:47:59.599 align:start position:0%
we have but not necessarily that it has
 
00:48:02.670 --> 00:48:02.680 align:start position:0%
to be in our budget I I I don't you know
 
00:48:04.430 --> 00:48:04.440 align:start position:0%
I don't feel like I need to Empire build
 
00:48:07.270 --> 00:48:07.280 align:start position:0%
in this direction uh if that was the
 
00:48:10.790 --> 00:48:10.800 align:start position:0%
question okay thank you any further
 
00:48:14.109 --> 00:48:14.119 align:start position:0%
questions yes representative bit excuse
 
00:48:17.510 --> 00:48:17.520 align:start position:0%
me thank thank you Mr chair
 
00:48:19.630 --> 00:48:19.640 align:start position:0%
um hope I can remember what I was going
 
00:48:21.910 --> 00:48:21.920 align:start position:0%
to say to you but
 
00:48:25.230 --> 00:48:25.240 align:start position:0%
uh you know W with the commission that
 
00:48:27.549 --> 00:48:27.559 align:start position:0%
know the Drinking Water Commission
 
00:48:30.710 --> 00:48:30.720 align:start position:0%
in in the work it's doing um one of the
 
00:48:33.750 --> 00:48:33.760 align:start position:0%
things that has helped um is that there
 
00:48:35.230 --> 00:48:35.240 align:start position:0%
have been there there are a couple
 
00:48:38.030 --> 00:48:38.040 align:start position:0%
members from from the legislature you
 
00:48:39.309 --> 00:48:39.319 align:start position:0%
know both the Senate and the house
 
00:48:41.910 --> 00:48:41.920 align:start position:0%
mostly the house
 
00:48:44.790 --> 00:48:44.800 align:start position:0%
and you already have 17 members being
 
00:48:46.750 --> 00:48:46.760 align:start position:0%
suggested for this this commission I
 
00:48:49.349 --> 00:48:49.359 align:start position:0%
didn't see any um senators or
 
00:48:51.950 --> 00:48:51.960 align:start position:0%
Representatives mentioned there and at
 
00:48:54.789 --> 00:48:54.799 align:start position:0%
times it has helped to
 
00:48:58.430 --> 00:48:58.440 align:start position:0%
generate um recommendations
 
00:49:00.870 --> 00:49:00.880 align:start position:0%
um because of the relationship we have
 
00:49:03.190 --> 00:49:03.200 align:start position:0%
with the bills that are being put in and
 
00:49:05.069 --> 00:49:05.079 align:start position:0%
also recommendations for bills that
 
00:49:08.309 --> 00:49:08.319 align:start position:0%
we've that have been made that um
 
00:49:09.829 --> 00:49:09.839 align:start position:0%
there's there's nobody I was going to
 
00:49:11.589 --> 00:49:11.599 align:start position:0%
mention this to Senator Waters but
 
00:49:13.390 --> 00:49:13.400 align:start position:0%
there's do you think there should be
 
00:49:15.349 --> 00:49:15.359 align:start position:0%
somebody there even though it makes it
 
00:49:18.470 --> 00:49:18.480 align:start position:0%
you know 17 is unbelievable but uh to
 
00:49:20.549 --> 00:49:20.559 align:start position:0%
make it even uh I want to say more
 
00:49:22.470 --> 00:49:22.480 align:start position:0%
unwieldy but as long as you get people
 
00:49:24.470 --> 00:49:24.480 align:start position:0%
working on it it's fine having a large
 
00:49:26.950 --> 00:49:26.960 align:start position:0%
number so thanks for the question uh um
 
00:49:28.750 --> 00:49:28.760 align:start position:0%
you know I think this is uh at this
 
00:49:31.190 --> 00:49:31.200 align:start position:0%
point this is your bill um and so it's
 
00:49:33.069 --> 00:49:33.079 align:start position:0%
really your wisdom uh brought to the
 
00:49:36.190 --> 00:49:36.200 align:start position:0%
bear my experience is similar to yours
 
00:49:38.789 --> 00:49:38.799 align:start position:0%
uh representative Edgar is that um on
 
00:49:40.309 --> 00:49:40.319 align:start position:0%
the various different committees and
 
00:49:42.150 --> 00:49:42.160 align:start position:0%
commissions that I've had the pleasure
 
00:49:44.910 --> 00:49:44.920 align:start position:0%
of working on having a legislative voice
 
00:49:47.549 --> 00:49:47.559 align:start position:0%
has been particularly important um I
 
00:49:48.990 --> 00:49:49.000 align:start position:0%
think about the recent
 
00:49:50.870 --> 00:49:50.880 align:start position:0%
cyanobacteria uh committee that we
 
00:49:54.710 --> 00:49:54.720 align:start position:0%
recently had and um uh chair renz Zulo
 
00:49:57.230 --> 00:49:57.240 align:start position:0%
sat uh in that committee
 
00:49:59.230 --> 00:49:59.240 align:start position:0%
um not in a leadership role but in the
 
00:50:01.230 --> 00:50:01.240 align:start position:0%
role that I think you're suggesting that
 
00:50:03.589 --> 00:50:03.599 align:start position:0%
is to bring the voice of the legislature
 
00:50:06.270 --> 00:50:06.280 align:start position:0%
and the policy makers uh into that as
 
00:50:07.950 --> 00:50:07.960 align:start position:0%
well as to carry the message from the
 
00:50:11.190 --> 00:50:11.200 align:start position:0%
committee back uh to his committee uh
 
00:50:12.390 --> 00:50:12.400 align:start position:0%
which is you know key for that
 
00:50:15.030 --> 00:50:15.040 align:start position:0%
particular subject so it seems like a a
 
00:50:18.309 --> 00:50:18.319 align:start position:0%
reasonable recommendation uh to me thank
 
00:50:21.510 --> 00:50:21.520 align:start position:0%
you thank you any further
 
00:50:23.710 --> 00:50:23.720 align:start position:0%
questions thank you thank you for your
 
00:50:26.950 --> 00:50:26.960 align:start position:0%
time yeah for represent edar I have had
 
00:50:29.069 --> 00:50:29.079 align:start position:0%
conversations with Senator waters on
 
00:50:31.829 --> 00:50:31.839 align:start position:0%
that subject and I believe you know the
 
00:50:33.950 --> 00:50:33.960 align:start position:0%
displeasure of the speaker to bring
 
00:50:36.549 --> 00:50:36.559 align:start position:0%
forward new commissions and committees
 
00:50:39.230 --> 00:50:39.240 align:start position:0%
and if we brought on a legislative
 
00:50:42.470 --> 00:50:42.480 align:start position:0%
person then we would be bound to make up
 
00:50:45.349 --> 00:50:45.359 align:start position:0%
a certain percentage of that committee
 
00:50:48.109 --> 00:50:48.119 align:start position:0%
and with 17 it would take quite a few
 
00:50:51.710 --> 00:50:51.720 align:start position:0%
legislators Andor Senators so that
 
00:50:54.829 --> 00:50:54.839 align:start position:0%
that's why it was structured in this way
 
00:50:58.470 --> 00:50:58.480 align:start position:0%
but we can certainly consider it
 
00:50:59.829 --> 00:50:59.839 align:start position:0%
uh thank thank you Mr chair I didn't
 
00:51:02.030 --> 00:51:02.040 align:start position:0%
realize there was a percentage uh
 
00:51:04.589 --> 00:51:04.599 align:start position:0%
requirement thank you there is okay I
 
00:51:06.789 --> 00:51:06.799 align:start position:0%
would like to recognize uh John Evans
 
00:51:11.829 --> 00:51:11.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:11.839 --> 00:51:16.390 align:start position:0%
 
Transportation

00:51:16.390 --> 00:51:16.400 align:start position:0%

00:51:31.789 --> 00:51:31.799 align:start position:0%
support for this bill by the Department
 
00:51:31.799 --> 00:51:32.470 align:start position:0%
support for this bill by the Department
of

00:51:32.470 --> 00:51:32.480 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:51:34.910 --> 00:51:34.920 align:start position:0%
Transportation um we we at the
 
00:51:37.390 --> 00:51:37.400 align:start position:0%
department uh have a very robust
 
00:51:39.549 --> 00:51:39.559 align:start position:0%
environmental review process that we
 
00:51:42.549 --> 00:51:42.559 align:start position:0%
follow and uh we coordinate closely with
 
00:51:44.750 --> 00:51:44.760 align:start position:0%
Dees and fishing game and many of our
 
00:51:48.549 --> 00:51:48.559 align:start position:0%
other uh re natural resource agencies uh
 
00:51:51.950 --> 00:51:51.960 align:start position:0%
both at the state and federal level and
 
00:51:56.069 --> 00:51:56.079 align:start position:0%
um as you can imagine the uh you know
 
00:51:58.510 --> 00:51:58.520 align:start position:0%
the with recent storms and stuff the
 
00:52:01.030 --> 00:52:01.040 align:start position:0%
these these can really uh
 
00:52:03.750 --> 00:52:03.760 align:start position:0%
create uh quite a quite a burden
 
00:52:06.870 --> 00:52:06.880 align:start position:0%
financially on the department so we we
 
00:52:10.309 --> 00:52:10.319 align:start position:0%
uh we support any any kind of uh
 
00:52:12.750 --> 00:52:12.760 align:start position:0%
planning level efforts which would would
 
00:52:14.109 --> 00:52:14.119 align:start position:0%
allow us
 
00:52:17.910 --> 00:52:17.920 align:start position:0%
to um you know plan appropriately and
 
00:52:19.270 --> 00:52:19.280 align:start position:0%
try to
 
00:52:21.910 --> 00:52:21.920 align:start position:0%
to ensure that we have the appropriate
 
00:52:25.150 --> 00:52:25.160 align:start position:0%
resources as we as we move into the into
 
00:52:27.150 --> 00:52:27.160 align:start position:0%
the future and so we we kind of look at
 
00:52:29.789 --> 00:52:29.799 align:start position:0%
this uh this committee as as really a
 
00:52:33.710 --> 00:52:33.720 align:start position:0%
sounding board for us to to identify
 
00:52:35.870 --> 00:52:35.880 align:start position:0%
needs uh make sure that they get into
 
00:52:38.069 --> 00:52:38.079 align:start position:0%
the trans you know the 10-year
 
00:52:42.270 --> 00:52:42.280 align:start position:0%
plan um you know we we obviously we we
 
00:52:46.750 --> 00:52:46.760 align:start position:0%
already are uh you know utilizing much
 
00:52:49.549 --> 00:52:49.559 align:start position:0%
of the science uh in in you know
 
00:52:52.670 --> 00:52:52.680 align:start position:0%
included in climate change uh we we
 
00:52:55.190 --> 00:52:55.200 align:start position:0%
participate uh as as Senator Waters
 
00:52:57.069 --> 00:52:57.079 align:start position:0%
mentioned in the coastal risk and
 
00:53:01.150 --> 00:53:01.160 align:start position:0%
Hazards uh commission and um but we we
 
00:53:02.910 --> 00:53:02.920 align:start position:0%
utilize there's there's a lot of
 
00:53:07.829 --> 00:53:07.839 align:start position:0%
different data out there um to to guide
 
00:53:10.069 --> 00:53:10.079 align:start position:0%
us but this would be a great kind of
 
00:53:12.789 --> 00:53:12.799 align:start position:0%
spot to kind of focus all of the the
 
00:53:15.069 --> 00:53:15.079 align:start position:0%
information and kind of give us a good
 
00:53:19.030 --> 00:53:19.040 align:start position:0%
spot to start with um to really say okay
 
00:53:20.870 --> 00:53:20.880 align:start position:0%
these These are the priorities and the
 
00:53:22.589 --> 00:53:22.599 align:start position:0%
these are how the department should try
 
00:53:26.190 --> 00:53:26.200 align:start position:0%
and allocate resources appropriately um
 
00:53:30.430 --> 00:53:30.440 align:start position:0%
as as you can imagine um you know
 
00:53:32.630 --> 00:53:32.640 align:start position:0%
generally when we when we think of
 
00:53:34.589 --> 00:53:34.599 align:start position:0%
climate change we often think and
 
00:53:36.589 --> 00:53:36.599 align:start position:0%
transportation particularly we often
 
00:53:39.829 --> 00:53:39.839 align:start position:0%
think okay we either need to go up and
 
00:53:44.589 --> 00:53:44.599 align:start position:0%
or out um we need more space uh because
 
00:53:47.230 --> 00:53:47.240 align:start position:0%
you know the the the water requires more
 
00:53:49.750 --> 00:53:49.760 align:start position:0%
more room it requires more you know it
 
00:53:52.510 --> 00:53:52.520 align:start position:0%
results in higher higher water levels
 
00:53:55.390 --> 00:53:55.400 align:start position:0%
during storm events and whatnot um so
 
00:53:56.510 --> 00:53:56.520 align:start position:0%
what that means is that the
 
00:53:58.589 --> 00:53:58.599 align:start position:0%
Transportation infrastructure also needs
 
00:54:02.510 --> 00:54:02.520 align:start position:0%
to go up and out um but what that can
 
00:54:04.710 --> 00:54:04.720 align:start position:0%
result in often times is actually
 
00:54:06.470 --> 00:54:06.480 align:start position:0%
additional environmental
 
00:54:09.630 --> 00:54:09.640 align:start position:0%
impacts um and so you know when you look
 
00:54:13.270 --> 00:54:13.280 align:start position:0%
at at that in the near term um you know
 
00:54:15.390 --> 00:54:15.400 align:start position:0%
you kind of one of the one of the goals
 
00:54:18.950 --> 00:54:18.960 align:start position:0%
of the department and and our procedures
 
00:54:21.589 --> 00:54:21.599 align:start position:0%
you know which are uh greatly focused on
 
00:54:23.309 --> 00:54:23.319 align:start position:0%
the National Environmental Policy Act
 
00:54:26.829 --> 00:54:26.839 align:start position:0%
which is essentially to just a avoid
 
00:54:28.829 --> 00:54:28.839 align:start position:0%
environmental impacts when you can
 
00:54:31.990 --> 00:54:32.000 align:start position:0%
minimize them if you can't and then
 
00:54:35.870 --> 00:54:35.880 align:start position:0%
mitigate kind of as a as a as necessary
 
00:54:37.710 --> 00:54:37.720 align:start position:0%
in accordance with the the rules and
 
00:54:40.349 --> 00:54:40.359 align:start position:0%
regulations now again going back to what
 
00:54:42.990 --> 00:54:43.000 align:start position:0%
I was saying before about how when when
 
00:54:44.910 --> 00:54:44.920 align:start position:0%
you're going up when the transportation
 
00:54:47.430 --> 00:54:47.440 align:start position:0%
system has to go up and out you're going
 
00:54:49.589 --> 00:54:49.599 align:start position:0%
to have additional environmental impacts
 
00:54:52.109 --> 00:54:52.119 align:start position:0%
now sometimes those can be if you're
 
00:54:54.270 --> 00:54:54.280 align:start position:0%
looking at the just the
 
00:54:57.789 --> 00:54:57.799 align:start position:0%
project in the in the current situation
 
00:55:02.630 --> 00:55:02.640 align:start position:0%
you may have um you may not end up being
 
00:55:05.589 --> 00:55:05.599 align:start position:0%
able to the
 
00:55:08.750 --> 00:55:08.760 align:start position:0%
the the additional you may end up with
 
00:55:11.150 --> 00:55:11.160 align:start position:0%
some additional environmental impacts
 
00:55:12.990 --> 00:55:13.000 align:start position:0%
but it's hard to justify those
 
00:55:16.309 --> 00:55:16.319 align:start position:0%
environmental impacts to go up uh if
 
00:55:19.710 --> 00:55:19.720 align:start position:0%
you're uh you know from an from a
 
00:55:22.230 --> 00:55:22.240 align:start position:0%
minimization standpoint so essentially
 
00:55:25.190 --> 00:55:25.200 align:start position:0%
you know if we build this bridge larger
 
00:55:28.069 --> 00:55:28.079 align:start position:0%
we may need larger a UTS and it may need
 
00:55:29.870 --> 00:55:29.880 align:start position:0%
to go higher in the embankments and may
 
00:55:32.589 --> 00:55:32.599 align:start position:0%
be larger that requires more uh more
 
00:55:34.470 --> 00:55:34.480 align:start position:0%
environmental impact so essentially what
 
00:55:37.430 --> 00:55:37.440 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to say here is that this this
 
00:55:41.029 --> 00:55:41.039 align:start position:0%
committee would help us focus on on
 
00:55:43.549 --> 00:55:43.559 align:start position:0%
hitting the right spot as to how how
 
00:55:45.349 --> 00:55:45.359 align:start position:0%
high do we need to go how wide do we
 
00:55:47.270 --> 00:55:47.280 align:start position:0%
need to go those kinds of things there's
 
00:55:48.710 --> 00:55:48.720 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of different information
 
00:55:51.270 --> 00:55:51.280 align:start position:0%
out there at the state and federal level
 
00:55:53.789 --> 00:55:53.799 align:start position:0%
um and certainly anytime that we we
 
00:55:55.630 --> 00:55:55.640 align:start position:0%
participate in a committee and can
 
00:55:55.640 --> 00:55:56.950 align:start position:0%
participate in a committee and can
demonstrate

00:55:56.950 --> 00:55:56.960 align:start position:0%
demonstrate
 
00:56:00.270 --> 00:56:00.280 align:start position:0%
to uh the the resource agencies that
 
00:56:03.270 --> 00:56:03.280 align:start position:0%
we've we've considered some of the the
 
00:56:05.750 --> 00:56:05.760 align:start position:0%
information from a from a a committee
 
00:56:08.510 --> 00:56:08.520 align:start position:0%
such as this that says okay we think
 
00:56:10.829 --> 00:56:10.839 align:start position:0%
that you should be designing roadways
 
00:56:14.349 --> 00:56:14.359 align:start position:0%
for you know for this elevation at this
 
00:56:16.870 --> 00:56:16.880 align:start position:0%
particular location that then then we
 
00:56:18.430 --> 00:56:18.440 align:start position:0%
can go to those resource agencies and
 
00:56:18.440 --> 00:56:19.430 align:start position:0%
can go to those resource agencies and
say

00:56:19.430 --> 00:56:19.440 align:start position:0%
say
 
00:56:23.549 --> 00:56:23.559 align:start position:0%
hey because the because of this standard
 
00:56:25.190 --> 00:56:25.200 align:start position:0%
that was set we actually need to
 
00:56:26.990 --> 00:56:27.000 align:start position:0%
increase our Environmental
 
00:56:30.190 --> 00:56:30.200 align:start position:0%
impacts um beyond the that which if
 
00:56:31.789 --> 00:56:31.799 align:start position:0%
you're just looking at that particular
 
00:56:34.390 --> 00:56:34.400 align:start position:0%
project may be we we probably could
 
00:56:36.589 --> 00:56:36.599 align:start position:0%
minimize our impacts more but in the
 
00:56:38.549 --> 00:56:38.559 align:start position:0%
long run it may be beneficial for the
 
00:56:41.230 --> 00:56:41.240 align:start position:0%
environment and the the the communities
 
00:56:42.349 --> 00:56:42.359 align:start position:0%
to actually have additional
 
00:56:44.190 --> 00:56:44.200 align:start position:0%
environmental impacts and and obviously
 
00:56:45.870 --> 00:56:45.880 align:start position:0%
getting that support from the resource
 
00:56:48.870 --> 00:56:48.880 align:start position:0%
agencies such as such as Dees uh and
 
00:56:50.829 --> 00:56:50.839 align:start position:0%
fishing game and whatnot would would
 
00:56:52.950 --> 00:56:52.960 align:start position:0%
greatly assist us and having them on the
 
00:56:55.870 --> 00:56:55.880 align:start position:0%
committee uh would would provide us with
 
00:56:57.670 --> 00:56:57.680 align:start position:0%
that opport opportunity to gain that
 
00:57:00.589 --> 00:57:00.599 align:start position:0%
support so
 
00:57:05.990 --> 00:57:06.000 align:start position:0%
um but uh uh I guess other than that I
 
00:57:09.670 --> 00:57:09.680 align:start position:0%
um I I would also uh like to add to I I
 
00:57:13.190 --> 00:57:13.200 align:start position:0%
agree with Senator Waters that uh
 
00:57:15.029 --> 00:57:15.039 align:start position:0%
participating in a in a committee such
 
00:57:17.150 --> 00:57:17.160 align:start position:0%
as this does uh put us in a better
 
00:57:19.549 --> 00:57:19.559 align:start position:0%
position for Grants grant
 
00:57:22.349 --> 00:57:22.359 align:start position:0%
opportunities um as as I think many of
 
00:57:24.549 --> 00:57:24.559 align:start position:0%
us may have heard uh just recently we
 
00:57:29.069 --> 00:57:29.079 align:start position:0%
got a grant for that to to uh to to
 
00:57:30.670 --> 00:57:30.680 align:start position:0%
address some of the issues related to
 
00:57:33.910 --> 00:57:33.920 align:start position:0%
the rment wall out in uh the on the on
 
00:57:37.589 --> 00:57:37.599 align:start position:0%
the Sea Coast in Northampton um that you
 
00:57:39.549 --> 00:57:39.559 align:start position:0%
know those are the types of grant
 
00:57:42.750 --> 00:57:42.760 align:start position:0%
opportunities that are out there that um
 
00:57:44.109 --> 00:57:44.119 align:start position:0%
participating in this committee and
 
00:57:46.470 --> 00:57:46.480 align:start position:0%
saying hey we're already this that we're
 
00:57:48.230 --> 00:57:48.240 align:start position:0%
designing to the standard that they've
 
00:57:51.430 --> 00:57:51.440 align:start position:0%
they've recommended uh that and
 
00:57:53.549 --> 00:57:53.559 align:start position:0%
therefore we need this additional money
 
00:57:57.029 --> 00:57:57.039 align:start position:0%
for for whatever that may be um so and
 
00:57:59.789 --> 00:57:59.799 align:start position:0%
and then also this would help us assist
 
00:58:01.710 --> 00:58:01.720 align:start position:0%
in and going back to what I mentioned
 
00:58:04.750 --> 00:58:04.760 align:start position:0%
previously just in making sure that that
 
00:58:08.630 --> 00:58:08.640 align:start position:0%
we prioritize properly as we we put
 
00:58:12.470 --> 00:58:12.480 align:start position:0%
projects into the 10-year plan um so
 
00:58:14.069 --> 00:58:14.079 align:start position:0%
with that I'll entertain any questions
 
00:58:16.710 --> 00:58:16.720 align:start position:0%
that thank you any questions for
 
00:58:20.710 --> 00:58:20.720 align:start position:0%
rans seeing none oh yes
 
00:58:22.829 --> 00:58:22.839 align:start position:0%
please thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
00:58:25.109 --> 00:58:25.119 align:start position:0%
you for taking me my question I'm trying
 
00:58:28.309 --> 00:58:28.319 align:start position:0%
to wrap my head around what's being said
 
00:58:28.319 --> 00:58:29.750 align:start position:0%
to wrap my head around what's being said
here

00:58:29.750 --> 00:58:29.760 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:58:32.470 --> 00:58:32.480 align:start position:0%
today you know first of all I would
 
00:58:34.230 --> 00:58:34.240 align:start position:0%
think why doesn't the executive branch
 
00:58:34.240 --> 00:58:35.549 align:start position:0%
think why doesn't the executive branch
already

00:58:35.549 --> 00:58:35.559 align:start position:0%
already
 
00:58:39.750 --> 00:58:39.760 align:start position:0%
have a council or committee to review
 
00:58:41.549 --> 00:58:41.559 align:start position:0%
everything everybody's doing to try to
 
00:58:44.510 --> 00:58:44.520 align:start position:0%
get everybody on the same page and
 
00:58:47.430 --> 00:58:47.440 align:start position:0%
realistically do you think the committee
 
00:58:48.990 --> 00:58:49.000 align:start position:0%
what everybody saying this committee is
 
00:58:51.349 --> 00:58:51.359 align:start position:0%
going to do realistically can be done in
 
00:58:55.029 --> 00:58:55.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:59.190 --> 00:58:59.200 align:start position:0%
year thank you for the question I I I I
 
00:59:02.069 --> 00:59:02.079 align:start position:0%
feel we certainly already have there are
 
00:59:04.910 --> 00:59:04.920 align:start position:0%
some resources out there but uh and you
 
00:59:07.069 --> 00:59:07.079 align:start position:0%
know for example the uh the coastal risk
 
00:59:10.630 --> 00:59:10.640 align:start position:0%
hazards uh commission is is a uh is a
 
00:59:13.069 --> 00:59:13.079 align:start position:0%
great resource out there but there
 
00:59:15.870 --> 00:59:15.880 align:start position:0%
are this committee not only focuses on
 
00:59:18.150 --> 00:59:18.160 align:start position:0%
say the coast but it would also focus on
 
00:59:19.990 --> 00:59:20.000 align:start position:0%
some of the more Inland areas which may
 
00:59:24.430 --> 00:59:24.440 align:start position:0%
not have as much uh as many advisory
 
00:59:27.510 --> 00:59:27.520 align:start position:0%
resources available to it so I I
 
00:59:29.870 --> 00:59:29.880 align:start position:0%
certainly uh feel that there is benefit
 
00:59:35.950 --> 00:59:35.960 align:start position:0%
in having having a a a larger um you
 
00:59:37.750 --> 00:59:37.760 align:start position:0%
know presence a committee that can
 
00:59:39.950 --> 00:59:39.960 align:start position:0%
address at the at the larger level
 
00:59:41.789 --> 00:59:41.799 align:start position:0%
because there's you know many of the the
 
00:59:44.270 --> 00:59:44.280 align:start position:0%
storm events aworth is aworth is a great
 
00:59:46.589 --> 00:59:46.599 align:start position:0%
example uh we've been working uh
 
00:59:49.510 --> 00:59:49.520 align:start position:0%
diligently with with Dees uh you know
 
00:59:53.910 --> 00:59:53.920 align:start position:0%
through our normal process but uh but
 
00:59:57.950 --> 00:59:57.960 align:start position:0%
having having you know the
 
01:00:02.549 --> 01:00:02.559 align:start position:0%
the having had coordination at the kind
 
01:00:04.789 --> 01:00:04.799 align:start position:0%
of the planning stage rather than the
 
01:00:07.510 --> 01:00:07.520 align:start position:0%
design stage would provide additional
 
01:00:08.990 --> 01:00:09.000 align:start position:0%
benefits to the department and that's
 
01:00:10.870 --> 01:00:10.880 align:start position:0%
really where where this would you know
 
01:00:12.990 --> 01:00:13.000 align:start position:0%
we feel that this would be provide the
 
01:00:14.750 --> 01:00:14.760 align:start position:0%
greatest benefit is more at the at the
 
01:00:16.950 --> 01:00:16.960 align:start position:0%
planning stage because the you know once
 
01:00:19.710 --> 01:00:19.720 align:start position:0%
we get to design we have the resources
 
01:00:21.150 --> 01:00:21.160 align:start position:0%
you know the resources that are
 
01:00:23.349 --> 01:00:23.359 align:start position:0%
available have already been allocated
 
01:00:24.750 --> 01:00:24.760 align:start position:0%
and you know we have to work within
 
01:00:27.470 --> 01:00:27.480 align:start position:0%
those those limits uh whereas if we know
 
01:00:29.990 --> 01:00:30.000 align:start position:0%
how what is necessary we can make sure
 
01:00:31.549 --> 01:00:31.559 align:start position:0%
that the proper amount of funds are in
 
01:00:34.190 --> 01:00:34.200 align:start position:0%
the 10year plan and whatnot and that's
 
01:00:36.549 --> 01:00:36.559 align:start position:0%
that's really uh where we feel the
 
01:00:38.789 --> 01:00:38.799 align:start position:0%
advantages of this this committee would
 
01:00:41.910 --> 01:00:41.920 align:start position:0%
be thank you yes
 
01:00:43.789 --> 01:00:43.799 align:start position:0%
followup thank you for taking my
 
01:00:47.069 --> 01:00:47.079 align:start position:0%
followup uh page
 
01:00:47.079 --> 01:00:49.750 align:start position:0%
followup uh page
two

01:00:49.750 --> 01:00:49.760 align:start position:0%
two
 
01:00:53.470 --> 01:00:53.480 align:start position:0%
line 32 says again it shall meet at
 
01:00:56.230 --> 01:00:56.240 align:start position:0%
least two times annually
 
01:00:58.630 --> 01:00:58.640 align:start position:0%
that just doesn't even seem realistic to
 
01:01:00.750 --> 01:01:00.760 align:start position:0%
me would you favor or do you think
 
01:01:03.069 --> 01:01:03.079 align:start position:0%
quarterly four times annually should be
 
01:01:03.079 --> 01:01:03.950 align:start position:0%
quarterly four times annually should be
in

01:01:03.950 --> 01:01:03.960 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:01:09.190 --> 01:01:09.200 align:start position:0%
here um I think I think to start with
 
01:01:11.589 --> 01:01:11.599 align:start position:0%
two times may be a great a good spot to
 
01:01:14.789 --> 01:01:14.799 align:start position:0%
start and I think I'm I'm
 
01:01:18.230 --> 01:01:18.240 align:start position:0%
I'm anticipating that you know this this
 
01:01:20.630 --> 01:01:20.640 align:start position:0%
may be one of those where we we try it
 
01:01:22.589 --> 01:01:22.599 align:start position:0%
out see how it goes and if it really is
 
01:01:23.950 --> 01:01:23.960 align:start position:0%
looking like hey there's a lot of
 
01:01:26.230 --> 01:01:26.240 align:start position:0%
advantages and we may need to meet more
 
01:01:29.349 --> 01:01:29.359 align:start position:0%
frequently um then then the committee
 
01:01:32.510 --> 01:01:32.520 align:start position:0%
might meet more frequently um I I
 
01:01:34.270 --> 01:01:34.280 align:start position:0%
believe Senator Waters did mentioned
 
01:01:35.710 --> 01:01:35.720 align:start position:0%
that you know it's kind of it's a
 
01:01:38.829 --> 01:01:38.839 align:start position:0%
starting point um and that that you know
 
01:01:42.109 --> 01:01:42.119 align:start position:0%
the design may may kind of come out as
 
01:01:45.029 --> 01:01:45.039 align:start position:0%
we as the committee would start to meet
 
01:01:47.670 --> 01:01:47.680 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you I'd just like to
 
01:01:50.190 --> 01:01:50.200 align:start position:0%
caution all that are uh participating
 
01:01:52.029 --> 01:01:52.039 align:start position:0%
the conversation we were speaking about
 
01:01:54.269 --> 01:01:54.279 align:start position:0%
a council not a committee we're not
 
01:01:56.789 --> 01:01:56.799 align:start position:0%
talking about a commission apologize
 
01:01:58.829 --> 01:01:58.839 align:start position:0%
believe me I'm the last one to correct
 
01:02:01.150 --> 01:02:01.160 align:start position:0%
someone I just I just need there there
 
01:02:03.269 --> 01:02:03.279 align:start position:0%
are different parameters for what we're
 
01:02:06.950 --> 01:02:06.960 align:start position:0%
talking about here and having been on
 
01:02:08.510 --> 01:02:08.520 align:start position:0%
the pleasure I don't know if it's the
 
01:02:11.069 --> 01:02:11.079 align:start position:0%
pleasure sometimes of of being the chair
 
01:02:14.710 --> 01:02:14.720 align:start position:0%
of commissions uh what I see happening
 
01:02:16.549 --> 01:02:16.559 align:start position:0%
um representative Newton your your
 
01:02:18.109 --> 01:02:18.119 align:start position:0%
thoughts on how much could get done the
 
01:02:19.910 --> 01:02:19.920 align:start position:0%
first meeting there is not going to get
 
01:02:23.510 --> 01:02:23.520 align:start position:0%
much done but my my assume my assumption
 
01:02:26.190 --> 01:02:26.200 align:start position:0%
is that direction will be given all
 
01:02:27.670 --> 01:02:27.680 align:start position:0%
these people so that their second
 
01:02:29.670 --> 01:02:29.680 align:start position:0%
meeting is productive when they come
 
01:02:31.549 --> 01:02:31.559 align:start position:0%
into the third and fourth meeting you
 
01:02:32.750 --> 01:02:32.760 align:start position:0%
know they're up and they're up and
 
01:02:34.589 --> 01:02:34.599 align:start position:0%
running was there someone else with a
 
01:02:38.190 --> 01:02:38.200 align:start position:0%
question okay thank you uh seeing no
 
01:02:40.990 --> 01:02:41.000 align:start position:0%
further thank you
 
01:02:44.870 --> 01:02:44.880 align:start position:0%
sir I'd like to recognize uh Nick
 
01:02:47.510 --> 01:02:47.520 align:start position:0%
kof am I somewhere near correct there
 
01:02:51.589 --> 01:02:51.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:53.549 --> 01:02:53.559 align:start position:0%
Foundation yes that's please you just
 
01:02:55.349 --> 01:02:55.359 align:start position:0%
handam the end and we'll pass them along
 
01:02:58.269 --> 01:02:58.279 align:start position:0%
thank you sir sir welcome to public
 
01:03:00.670 --> 01:03:00.680 align:start position:0%
works yeah thank you very much um Nick
 
01:03:02.309 --> 01:03:02.319 align:start position:0%
cof with the conservation law foundation
 
01:03:04.349 --> 01:03:04.359 align:start position:0%
and you did pronounce it correctly um
 
01:03:05.990 --> 01:03:06.000 align:start position:0%
most people don't so I commend you on
 
01:03:09.789 --> 01:03:09.799 align:start position:0%
that it's my um but yeah so yeah as I
 
01:03:11.109 --> 01:03:11.119 align:start position:0%
said I'm with the conservation law
 
01:03:13.150 --> 01:03:13.160 align:start position:0%
Foundation um and I'm here to urge you
 
01:03:15.910 --> 01:03:15.920 align:start position:0%
to support this bill today you know just
 
01:03:17.789 --> 01:03:17.799 align:start position:0%
over the past year alone we've seen a
 
01:03:19.510 --> 01:03:19.520 align:start position:0%
lot of severe weather affecting the
 
01:03:22.630 --> 01:03:22.640 align:start position:0%
state um you know we saw flash flooding
 
01:03:25.470 --> 01:03:25.480 align:start position:0%
um in the Upper Valley in manad regions
 
01:03:28.510 --> 01:03:28.520 align:start position:0%
um last July it was it was a huge storm
 
01:03:30.670 --> 01:03:30.680 align:start position:0%
you know with four or five Ines of rain
 
01:03:33.390 --> 01:03:33.400 align:start position:0%
in just one day and um you know some
 
01:03:35.710 --> 01:03:35.720 align:start position:0%
small towns were just decimated and the
 
01:03:37.589 --> 01:03:37.599 align:start position:0%
damage to the towns particularly aworth
 
01:03:40.710 --> 01:03:40.720 align:start position:0%
which Dees mentioned earlier um I think
 
01:03:43.150 --> 01:03:43.160 align:start position:0%
32 roads and and stream you know roads
 
01:03:46.069 --> 01:03:46.079 align:start position:0%
are washed out um you know the estimate
 
01:03:47.950 --> 01:03:47.960 align:start position:0%
to to that damage is you know cost
 
01:03:50.349 --> 01:03:50.359 align:start position:0%
around $20 million and you know this
 
01:03:51.870 --> 01:03:51.880 align:start position:0%
town has a budget of like a million and
 
01:03:54.309 --> 01:03:54.319 align:start position:0%
a half so you know this is this is
 
01:03:56.470 --> 01:03:56.480 align:start position:0%
decimating these towns budget
 
01:03:58.630 --> 01:03:58.640 align:start position:0%
um you we've seen other storms this
 
01:04:01.710 --> 01:04:01.720 align:start position:0%
storm this last December um you know
 
01:04:03.269 --> 01:04:03.279 align:start position:0%
severely hit North
 
01:04:06.150 --> 01:04:06.160 align:start position:0%
Conway um you know the White Mountains
 
01:04:08.390 --> 01:04:08.400 align:start position:0%
region yeah we saw us flooding in in
 
01:04:11.109 --> 01:04:11.119 align:start position:0%
Hampton um you know in January and have
 
01:04:12.750 --> 01:04:12.760 align:start position:0%
seen actually flooding a few times this
 
01:04:15.470 --> 01:04:15.480 align:start position:0%
winter and so you know this this is a
 
01:04:17.349 --> 01:04:17.359 align:start position:0%
huge problem um you know we need to
 
01:04:19.630 --> 01:04:19.640 align:start position:0%
start planning for for what's happening
 
01:04:21.069 --> 01:04:21.079 align:start position:0%
with these severe storms you know
 
01:04:22.630 --> 01:04:22.640 align:start position:0%
they're they're happening more
 
01:04:25.829 --> 01:04:25.839 align:start position:0%
frequently and um you these small towns
 
01:04:27.269 --> 01:04:27.279 align:start position:0%
you know the state you know need to
 
01:04:28.349 --> 01:04:28.359 align:start position:0%
prepare for them because otherwise
 
01:04:30.150 --> 01:04:30.160 align:start position:0%
they're just going to blow apart these
 
01:04:32.309 --> 01:04:32.319 align:start position:0%
budgets year after year um and so having
 
01:04:35.349 --> 01:04:35.359 align:start position:0%
a council like this that can um you know
 
01:04:37.230 --> 01:04:37.240 align:start position:0%
plan for develop adaptation and
 
01:04:38.670 --> 01:04:38.680 align:start position:0%
resilience strategies is what we really
 
01:04:42.829 --> 01:04:42.839 align:start position:0%
need um to get you know to ensure that
 
01:04:44.710 --> 01:04:44.720 align:start position:0%
um you know budgets don't get blown
 
01:04:46.390 --> 01:04:46.400 align:start position:0%
apart and that we develop the
 
01:04:49.269 --> 01:04:49.279 align:start position:0%
infrastructure needed to um you know to
 
01:04:52.349 --> 01:04:52.359 align:start position:0%
adapt and and uh to some of the severe
 
01:04:56.269 --> 01:04:56.279 align:start position:0%
weather um you know I once STC that is
 
01:04:57.710 --> 01:04:57.720 align:start position:0%
in the the comments which I passed
 
01:05:00.630 --> 01:05:00.640 align:start position:0%
around is that Noah estimates that there
 
01:05:03.910 --> 01:05:03.920 align:start position:0%
were three major weather events last
 
01:05:06.430 --> 01:05:06.440 align:start position:0%
year in 2023 that are estimated to have
 
01:05:09.829 --> 01:05:09.839 align:start position:0%
cost the state between1 and $250 million
 
01:05:12.309 --> 01:05:12.319 align:start position:0%
so you know there's the two um December
 
01:05:14.109 --> 01:05:14.119 align:start position:0%
and the July flooding events and then
 
01:05:17.430 --> 01:05:17.440 align:start position:0%
there was a a cold front last February
 
01:05:19.269 --> 01:05:19.279 align:start position:0%
but those those three events you know
 
01:05:22.549 --> 01:05:22.559 align:start position:0%
cost the state a ton of money and so um
 
01:05:24.710 --> 01:05:24.720 align:start position:0%
we need to start planning for you know
 
01:05:26.150 --> 01:05:26.160 align:start position:0%
to to develop infrastructure structure
 
01:05:28.349 --> 01:05:28.359 align:start position:0%
that can really um adapt to this change
 
01:05:30.029 --> 01:05:30.039 align:start position:0%
that we're seeing um to adapt to this
 
01:05:33.670 --> 01:05:33.680 align:start position:0%
extreme weather um you know also there's
 
01:05:35.309 --> 01:05:35.319 align:start position:0%
the public health impacts that we're
 
01:05:38.549 --> 01:05:38.559 align:start position:0%
seeing from from events like this um so
 
01:05:41.150 --> 01:05:41.160 align:start position:0%
we need to adapt to that as well and so
 
01:05:43.269 --> 01:05:43.279 align:start position:0%
you the failure to plan ahead is just
 
01:05:45.269 --> 01:05:45.279 align:start position:0%
going to mean that you budgets get blown
 
01:05:47.230 --> 01:05:47.240 align:start position:0%
apart and that physical infrastructure
 
01:05:49.269 --> 01:05:49.279 align:start position:0%
continually gets um you know gets
 
01:05:52.309 --> 01:05:52.319 align:start position:0%
destroyed by these these weather systems
 
01:05:55.230 --> 01:05:55.240 align:start position:0%
um and so I urge you to support this
 
01:05:57.670 --> 01:05:57.680 align:start position:0%
bill I think it's sorely needed and um
 
01:05:59.109 --> 01:05:59.119 align:start position:0%

um our members particularly value the
 
01:07:13.190 --> 01:07:13.200 align:start position:0%
opportunity that this Council brings
 
01:07:15.789 --> 01:07:15.799 align:start position:0%
because it um has is charged with work
 
01:07:17.430 --> 01:07:17.440 align:start position:0%
that would be proactive rather than
 
01:07:18.910 --> 01:07:18.920 align:start position:0%
reactive and we see that as really
 
01:07:22.069 --> 01:07:22.079 align:start position:0%
beneficial for the state um ultimately
 
01:07:24.589 --> 01:07:24.599 align:start position:0%
this bill was amended um in the Senate
 
01:07:26.910 --> 01:07:26.920 align:start position:0%
and the sponsor so kindly added a seat
 
01:07:28.390 --> 01:07:28.400 align:start position:0%
for the business and industry
 
01:07:30.269 --> 01:07:30.279 align:start position:0%
Association um just to be completely
 
01:07:31.829 --> 01:07:31.839 align:start position:0%
transparent that was not a seat that we
 
01:07:34.190 --> 01:07:34.200 align:start position:0%
requested but we are uh very grateful to
 
01:07:35.589 --> 01:07:35.599 align:start position:0%
have the opportunity to be a part of
 
01:07:38.150 --> 01:07:38.160 align:start position:0%
this Council um we believe we can help
 
01:07:40.630 --> 01:07:40.640 align:start position:0%
by bringing in experts from industry and
 
01:07:43.390 --> 01:07:43.400 align:start position:0%
uh uh specifically uh the sponsor uh
 
01:07:45.109 --> 01:07:45.119 align:start position:0%
indicated interest in the insurance
 
01:07:46.510 --> 01:07:46.520 align:start position:0%
industry and and sharing their
 
01:07:48.470 --> 01:07:48.480 align:start position:0%
perspective and how they can be helpful
 
01:07:50.750 --> 01:07:50.760 align:start position:0%
going forward um ultimately we believe
 
01:07:52.870 --> 01:07:52.880 align:start position:0%
that this bill has good um thoughtful
 
01:07:54.990 --> 01:07:55.000 align:start position:0%
precautions so we would respectfully
 
01:07:57.269 --> 01:07:57.279 align:start position:0%
encourage committee to pass this Bill
 
01:07:58.510 --> 01:07:58.520 align:start position:0%
thank you I'd be happy to take any
 
01:08:02.230 --> 01:08:02.240 align:start position:0%
questions other questions Madam Kos yes
 
01:08:04.309 --> 01:08:04.319 align:start position:0%
please thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
01:08:06.190 --> 01:08:06.200 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question so would Bia
 
01:08:09.829 --> 01:08:09.839 align:start position:0%
be interested in uh Staffing this
 
01:08:12.109 --> 01:08:12.119 align:start position:0%
group uh thank you for the question I
 
01:08:13.670 --> 01:08:13.680 align:start position:0%
believe it would be the purview of the
 
01:08:16.709 --> 01:08:16.719 align:start position:0%
council to elect a chair um we'd be
 
01:08:18.829 --> 01:08:18.839 align:start position:0%
happy to serve in whatever capacity is
 
01:08:20.749 --> 01:08:20.759 align:start position:0%
necessary though I feel that we're
 
01:08:22.390 --> 01:08:22.400 align:start position:0%
probably not the main character in this
 
01:08:25.630 --> 01:08:25.640 align:start position:0%
story and so uh we'll we'll serve the
 
01:08:28.229 --> 01:08:28.239 align:start position:0%
role that would be appropriate for us
 
01:08:29.990 --> 01:08:30.000 align:start position:0%
thank you further
 
01:08:32.229 --> 01:08:32.239 align:start position:0%
question a mind to you are you the one
 
01:08:34.430 --> 01:08:34.440 align:start position:0%
that generates the legislative scorecard
 
01:08:36.630 --> 01:08:36.640 align:start position:0%
because maybe we should
 
01:08:39.149 --> 01:08:39.159 align:start position:0%
talk that is the role of our policy
 
01:08:41.669 --> 01:08:41.679 align:start position:0%
staff as a whole thank you thank you for
 
01:08:43.709 --> 01:08:43.719 align:start position:0%

Meredith Hatfield with the nature
 
01:09:17.990 --> 01:09:18.000 align:start position:0%
conservancy and with me is Matt Thorne
 
01:09:20.789 --> 01:09:20.799 align:start position:0%
and he focuses on uh climate adaptation
 
01:09:23.470 --> 01:09:23.480 align:start position:0%
for our office we've been working in New
 
01:09:25.829 --> 01:09:25.839 align:start position:0%
Hampshire for over 60 years on a range
 
01:09:28.229 --> 01:09:28.239 align:start position:0%
of environmental issues and we are
 
01:09:30.789 --> 01:09:30.799 align:start position:0%
increasingly focused on resilience
 
01:09:32.829 --> 01:09:32.839 align:start position:0%
working with agencies and communities to
 
01:09:35.390 --> 01:09:35.400 align:start position:0%
help them become more resilient uh there
 
01:09:36.910 --> 01:09:36.920 align:start position:0%
are three things that I just handed out
 
01:09:40.870 --> 01:09:40.880 align:start position:0%
to you the first is our testimony letter
 
01:09:43.749 --> 01:09:43.759 align:start position:0%
um the second is something that um my
 
01:09:45.950 --> 01:09:45.960 align:start position:0%
colleague is going to talk to you about
 
01:09:48.590 --> 01:09:48.600 align:start position:0%
in a minute um a two-pager about
 
01:09:50.910 --> 01:09:50.920 align:start position:0%
building uh flood resilience in New
 
01:09:53.669 --> 01:09:53.679 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and then the third thing is a
 
01:09:55.390 --> 01:09:55.400 align:start position:0%
group letter from a bunch of our
 
01:09:58.590 --> 01:09:58.600 align:start position:0%
colleagues um and I won't read them all
 
01:10:00.110 --> 01:10:00.120 align:start position:0%
to you uh you can see them right there
 
01:10:02.750 --> 01:10:02.760 align:start position:0%
on the page um but they are eight other
 
01:10:06.390 --> 01:10:06.400 align:start position:0%
partner uh nonprofit groups who not only
 
01:10:09.310 --> 01:10:09.320 align:start position:0%
support the bill but who I also think
 
01:10:11.870 --> 01:10:11.880 align:start position:0%
could bring some uh important
 
01:10:13.870 --> 01:10:13.880 align:start position:0%
information and support to the council
 
01:10:16.110 --> 01:10:16.120 align:start position:0%
if you choose to pass the legislation
 
01:10:18.750 --> 01:10:18.760 align:start position:0%
and we do strongly support the bill um
 
01:10:20.669 --> 01:10:20.679 align:start position:0%
so I'm going to turn it over to Matt and
 
01:10:22.229 --> 01:10:22.239 align:start position:0%
he's going to talk to you about
 
01:10:24.310 --> 01:10:24.320 align:start position:0%
culbert's one of his favorite
 
01:10:26.950 --> 01:10:26.960 align:start position:0%
things everyone's favorite thing Matt
 
01:10:28.790 --> 01:10:28.800 align:start position:0%
Thorne from The Nature
 
01:10:32.110 --> 01:10:32.120 align:start position:0%
Conservancy uh so why is the nature
 
01:10:34.590 --> 01:10:34.600 align:start position:0%
conservancy uh entering into this
 
01:10:36.310 --> 01:10:36.320 align:start position:0%
adaptation work because we're not
 
01:10:38.669 --> 01:10:38.679 align:start position:0%
keeping up with the weather um that is
 
01:10:41.430 --> 01:10:41.440 align:start position:0%
wreaking havoc on our infrastructure but
 
01:10:43.350 --> 01:10:43.360 align:start position:0%
we can build to work with nature and
 
01:10:45.470 --> 01:10:45.480 align:start position:0%
work with the streams and rivers uh and
 
01:10:49.470 --> 01:10:49.480 align:start position:0%
not fight it so to sum sum it up uh very
 
01:10:52.030 --> 01:10:52.040 align:start position:0%
simply an ounce of prevention is worth a
 
01:10:55.510 --> 01:10:55.520 align:start position:0%
pound of cure or I should probably say
 
01:10:57.510 --> 01:10:57.520 align:start position:0%
an ounce of well coordinated prevention
 
01:10:59.070 --> 01:10:59.080 align:start position:0%
is worth a pound of
 
01:11:01.270 --> 01:11:01.280 align:start position:0%
cure um I do get to work in the world of
 
01:11:03.470 --> 01:11:03.480 align:start position:0%
culverts a little bit which I feel that
 
01:11:05.669 --> 01:11:05.679 align:start position:0%
some folks on this committee may have
 
01:11:08.470 --> 01:11:08.480 align:start position:0%
experience with or or familiarity with
 
01:11:11.030 --> 01:11:11.040 align:start position:0%
we just finished up a project on topaz
 
01:11:13.750 --> 01:11:13.760 align:start position:0%
drive right off Route four in barington
 
01:11:15.070 --> 01:11:15.080 align:start position:0%
uh and I bring it up because it's a
 
01:11:18.070 --> 01:11:18.080 align:start position:0%
classic example of where New Hampshire
 
01:11:20.830 --> 01:11:20.840 align:start position:0%
finds itself in in places and at times
 
01:11:22.630 --> 01:11:22.640 align:start position:0%
with its infrastructure and some of the
 
01:11:24.990 --> 01:11:25.000 align:start position:0%
photos you'll see in the two-pager are
 
01:11:28.189 --> 01:11:28.199 align:start position:0%
called colorful examples of what happens
 
01:11:31.910 --> 01:11:31.920 align:start position:0%
um when uh when we're not properly
 
01:11:34.550 --> 01:11:34.560 align:start position:0%
prepared so there's one Road in and out
 
01:11:36.510 --> 01:11:36.520 align:start position:0%
of emerald Acres Cooperative it's a
 
01:11:38.910 --> 01:11:38.920 align:start position:0%
mobile home community and the Oyster
 
01:11:41.669 --> 01:11:41.679 align:start position:0%
River FL flows underneath that road
 
01:11:45.030 --> 01:11:45.040 align:start position:0%
through a 7 foot high by 9 and 1/2t wide
 
01:11:47.350 --> 01:11:47.360 align:start position:0%
elliptical metal
 
01:11:50.070 --> 01:11:50.080 align:start position:0%
covert uh it also happens to Black to
 
01:11:52.149 --> 01:11:52.159 align:start position:0%
block fish passage which is how it first
 
01:11:54.990 --> 01:11:55.000 align:start position:0%
got on our radar and in 2007 you can see
 
01:11:57.149 --> 01:11:57.159 align:start position:0%
by the photo it totally washed out
 
01:11:59.070 --> 01:11:59.080 align:start position:0%
during the Patriots Day storm it also
 
01:12:00.590 --> 01:12:00.600 align:start position:0%
got hammered the year before during the
 
01:12:02.270 --> 01:12:02.280 align:start position:0%
Mother's Day
 
01:12:04.790 --> 01:12:04.800 align:start position:0%
storm uh residents lacked emergency
 
01:12:07.870 --> 01:12:07.880 align:start position:0%
access for almost a week and there was
 
01:12:09.990 --> 01:12:10.000 align:start position:0%
an incident where a medical emergency
 
01:12:11.750 --> 01:12:11.760 align:start position:0%
someone had to be carried you know by a
 
01:12:13.669 --> 01:12:13.679 align:start position:0%
stretcher through the woods to get the
 
01:12:16.750 --> 01:12:16.760 align:start position:0%
the proper care they needed and so it
 
01:12:18.149 --> 01:12:18.159 align:start position:0%
was pretty terrifying for the h hundred
 
01:12:21.590 --> 01:12:21.600 align:start position:0%
or so uh there's 100 or so homes there
 
01:12:23.750 --> 01:12:23.760 align:start position:0%
for the residents of those
 
01:12:28.590 --> 01:12:28.600 align:start position:0%
homes and so what happened next was that
 
01:12:30.750 --> 01:12:30.760 align:start position:0%
in some emergency repairs they kind of
 
01:12:33.149 --> 01:12:33.159 align:start position:0%
dragged the old Culvert back Upstream
 
01:12:36.110 --> 01:12:36.120 align:start position:0%
slapped it back into place and uh kind
 
01:12:39.550 --> 01:12:39.560 align:start position:0%
of moved on a group of Partners came
 
01:12:43.430 --> 01:12:43.440 align:start position:0%
together to try to help replace uh that
 
01:12:46.270 --> 01:12:46.280 align:start position:0%
old covert with a properly sized one
 
01:12:49.310 --> 01:12:49.320 align:start position:0%
that would be able to accommodate the
 
01:12:52.189 --> 01:12:52.199 align:start position:0%
next storm that was surely to come uh
 
01:12:55.270 --> 01:12:55.280 align:start position:0%
and at that time this is 2009 it cost
 
01:12:56.750 --> 01:12:56.760 align:start position:0%
the estimates were about
 
01:13:00.550 --> 01:13:00.560 align:start position:0%
250,000 to to finish the job to get the
 
01:13:03.350 --> 01:13:03.360 align:start position:0%
right size piece infrastructure in
 
01:13:07.070 --> 01:13:07.080 align:start position:0%
place um unfortunately fell about
 
01:13:10.189 --> 01:13:10.199 align:start position:0%
$25,000 short and it took us till
 
01:13:12.990 --> 01:13:13.000 align:start position:0%
2023 to finish the job so this just
 
01:13:15.229 --> 01:13:15.239 align:start position:0%
wrapped up in in October of this last
 
01:13:18.510 --> 01:13:18.520 align:start position:0%
year by that time it was
 
01:13:23.590 --> 01:13:23.600 align:start position:0%
$750,000 so the the damage the cost of
 
01:13:25.510 --> 01:13:25.520 align:start position:0%
emergency repairs that had to happen in
 
01:13:28.950 --> 01:13:28.960 align:start position:0%
the interm inflation Supply costs
 
01:13:31.830 --> 01:13:31.840 align:start position:0%
increased contractor costs so that was
 
01:13:34.270 --> 01:13:34.280 align:start position:0%
three times the cost by by waiting that
 
01:13:35.550 --> 01:13:35.560 align:start position:0%
that amount of
 
01:13:39.350 --> 01:13:39.360 align:start position:0%
time plus the stress on the community um
 
01:13:43.030 --> 01:13:43.040 align:start position:0%
there's a on the backside there's um uh
 
01:13:45.430 --> 01:13:45.440 align:start position:0%
some quotes by folks that that live
 
01:13:46.830 --> 01:13:46.840 align:start position:0%
there and just kind of the constant
 
01:13:48.430 --> 01:13:48.440 align:start position:0%
stress of having to go check on your
 
01:13:50.030 --> 01:13:50.040 align:start position:0%
road during every storm to make sure you
 
01:13:52.149 --> 01:13:52.159 align:start position:0%
weren't going to get stranded is is uh
 
01:13:53.550 --> 01:13:53.560 align:start position:0%
is real for a lot for a lot of New
 
01:13:56.070 --> 01:13:56.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire residents
 
01:13:58.350 --> 01:13:58.360 align:start position:0%
uh so you know again we either pay for
 
01:14:01.110 --> 01:14:01.120 align:start position:0%
it now one and done or we pay for these
 
01:14:03.070 --> 01:14:03.080 align:start position:0%
emergency repairs plus the inflated
 
01:14:05.110 --> 01:14:05.120 align:start position:0%
future costs uh and this is just an
 
01:14:07.669 --> 01:14:07.679 align:start position:0%
example you know we're working with New
 
01:14:09.189 --> 01:14:09.199 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Department of Transportation
 
01:14:11.669 --> 01:14:11.679 align:start position:0%
and and a hand full of municipalities on
 
01:14:13.830 --> 01:14:13.840 align:start position:0%
a few of these but we can really only
 
01:14:16.470 --> 01:14:16.480 align:start position:0%
work project by project um and to
 
01:14:18.390 --> 01:14:18.400 align:start position:0%
commend the good work of Dees with that
 
01:14:20.310 --> 01:14:20.320 align:start position:0%
that Culvert program which supported
 
01:14:23.430 --> 01:14:23.440 align:start position:0%
four I believe it was four CT important
 
01:14:26.350 --> 01:14:26.360 align:start position:0%
C projects it's it's valuable but
 
01:14:29.910 --> 01:14:29.920 align:start position:0%
there's 21,000 CS in the state and not
 
01:14:32.590 --> 01:14:32.600 align:start position:0%
all of them need to be fixed but a good
 
01:14:34.870 --> 01:14:34.880 align:start position:0%
half of them are not the right size for
 
01:14:37.310 --> 01:14:37.320 align:start position:0%
the rivers or streams passing through
 
01:14:39.910 --> 01:14:39.920 align:start position:0%
and we're on the order of of hundreds
 
01:14:42.910 --> 01:14:42.920 align:start position:0%
that are that really do need to be fixed
 
01:14:46.270 --> 01:14:46.280 align:start position:0%
soon so it's a it's a bit of a scale
 
01:14:48.390 --> 01:14:48.400 align:start position:0%
issue which is where a planning Council
 
01:14:51.229 --> 01:14:51.239 align:start position:0%
like this can be have a lot of
 
01:14:54.110 --> 01:14:54.120 align:start position:0%
forethought and help bring together all
 
01:14:55.950 --> 01:14:55.960 align:start position:0%
the agencies the practitioners the
 
01:14:58.189 --> 01:14:58.199 align:start position:0%
people out there on the ground
 
01:15:00.470 --> 01:15:00.480 align:start position:0%
engineers and and all the players that
 
01:15:01.990 --> 01:15:02.000 align:start position:0%
that got to really think through this
 
01:15:03.550 --> 01:15:03.560 align:start position:0%
how do we kind of finally get ahead of
 
01:15:06.070 --> 01:15:06.080 align:start position:0%
this instead of always trying to play
 
01:15:09.590 --> 01:15:09.600 align:start position:0%
catchup um so the way we we accomplished
 
01:15:11.030 --> 01:15:11.040 align:start position:0%
this project and there was a beautiful
 
01:15:13.350 --> 01:15:13.360 align:start position:0%
Bridge put in by New Hampshire uh Bridge
 
01:15:16.030 --> 01:15:16.040 align:start position:0%
contractor um which was a really
 
01:15:19.950 --> 01:15:19.960 align:start position:0%
successful project so everyone was happy
 
01:15:23.229 --> 01:15:23.239 align:start position:0%
um but it was pretty rag tag you know
 
01:15:25.430 --> 01:15:25.440 align:start position:0%
there was a lot of players rling and it
 
01:15:28.310 --> 01:15:28.320 align:start position:0%
took us 15 years to get it done and uh
 
01:15:32.350 --> 01:15:32.360 align:start position:0%
and again we just uh didn't quite have
 
01:15:34.270 --> 01:15:34.280 align:start position:0%
that kind of effective coordination
 
01:15:36.550 --> 01:15:36.560 align:start position:0%
among state and local agencies and the
 
01:15:37.830 --> 01:15:37.840 align:start position:0%
scientists and the day-to-day
 
01:15:39.510 --> 01:15:39.520 align:start position:0%
practitioners so that's kind of what
 
01:15:41.030 --> 01:15:41.040 align:start position:0%
we're moving towards so we can do this
 
01:15:43.590 --> 01:15:43.600 align:start position:0%
thing a little bigger and a little more
 
01:15:47.070 --> 01:15:47.080 align:start position:0%
scale thank you questions Mr
 
01:15:50.750 --> 01:15:50.760 align:start position:0%
Thorne yes please represent Newman yes
 
01:15:52.830 --> 01:15:52.840 align:start position:0%
thank you could you go back to your
 
01:15:56.590 --> 01:15:56.600 align:start position:0%
comment there's 21,000 coverts in New
 
01:15:59.510 --> 01:15:59.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and half of them
 
01:16:03.550 --> 01:16:03.560 align:start position:0%
aren't quite so um
 
01:16:05.950 --> 01:16:05.960 align:start position:0%
appropriate yeah there so there's a
 
01:16:08.510 --> 01:16:08.520 align:start position:0%
stream Crossing assessment that's been
 
01:16:11.390 --> 01:16:11.400 align:start position:0%
working its way through 21 or so
 
01:16:15.430 --> 01:16:15.440 align:start position:0%
thousand covers in the state and they're
 
01:16:19.229 --> 01:16:19.239 align:start position:0%
um evaluated for how they fit based on
 
01:16:21.750 --> 01:16:21.760 align:start position:0%
the um the hydrology and the
 
01:16:25.790 --> 01:16:25.800 align:start position:0%
geomorphology of the stream channel so
 
01:16:28.950 --> 01:16:28.960 align:start position:0%
they a lot of our road infrastructure is
 
01:16:31.149 --> 01:16:31.159 align:start position:0%
really old so it's not just that it that
 
01:16:33.830 --> 01:16:33.840 align:start position:0%
a lot of them don't fit properly uh as
 
01:16:35.669 --> 01:16:35.679 align:start position:0%
the gentleman from New Hampshire dot
 
01:16:37.629 --> 01:16:37.639 align:start position:0%
said that they got to be bigger and they
 
01:16:39.470 --> 01:16:39.480 align:start position:0%
got to go further out uh but they're
 
01:16:42.189 --> 01:16:42.199 align:start position:0%
also old and failing in a lot of cases
 
01:16:44.470 --> 01:16:44.480 align:start position:0%
uh you know metal rusted out CS like in
 
01:16:47.189 --> 01:16:47.199 align:start position:0%
in the case here when they the excavator
 
01:16:49.189 --> 01:16:49.199 align:start position:0%
lifted this one out of the ground there
 
01:16:51.310 --> 01:16:51.320 align:start position:0%
was no bottom I mean it was it was like
 
01:16:53.390 --> 01:16:53.400 align:start position:0%
it wasn't serving its purpose it just
 
01:16:55.110 --> 01:16:55.120 align:start position:0%
kind of fell apart and crumbled on the
 
01:16:58.229 --> 01:16:58.239 align:start position:0%
side of the road um so it's uh there
 
01:16:59.550 --> 01:16:59.560 align:start position:0%
there's just a lot of Aging
 
01:17:02.149 --> 01:17:02.159 align:start position:0%
infrastructure that was put in you know
 
01:17:04.550 --> 01:17:04.560 align:start position:0%
50 or 75 or 100 years ago and it's just
 
01:17:07.110 --> 01:17:07.120 align:start position:0%
not it's it's not up to the to the speed
 
01:17:10.070 --> 01:17:10.080 align:start position:0%
thank you quick followup yes thank you
 
01:17:12.470 --> 01:17:12.480 align:start position:0%
could I just ask is there a um an
 
01:17:15.390 --> 01:17:15.400 align:start position:0%
organized schedule to evaluate these
 
01:17:18.470 --> 01:17:18.480 align:start position:0%
things or a section of the state at a
 
01:17:22.189 --> 01:17:22.199 align:start position:0%
time or how how does this work get done
 
01:17:24.149 --> 01:17:24.159 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you for the question yeah
 
01:17:26.149 --> 01:17:26.159 align:start position:0%
there is to to my understanding and I
 
01:17:29.470 --> 01:17:29.480 align:start position:0%
don't serve on this um in this group but
 
01:17:33.350 --> 01:17:33.360 align:start position:0%
there is inter agency work to go to
 
01:17:36.270 --> 01:17:36.280 align:start position:0%
assess them uh kind of region or
 
01:17:38.229 --> 01:17:38.239 align:start position:0%
Watershed by Watershed throughout the
 
01:17:40.070 --> 01:17:40.080 align:start position:0%
state and I think they've made really
 
01:17:42.510 --> 01:17:42.520 align:start position:0%
good progress and to to my understanding
 
01:17:43.910 --> 01:17:43.920 align:start position:0%
it's kind of now in the phase of
 
01:17:46.629 --> 01:17:46.639 align:start position:0%
finishing up assessing the the last ones
 
01:17:49.310 --> 01:17:49.320 align:start position:0%
and then kind of help put them in order
 
01:17:50.669 --> 01:17:50.679 align:start position:0%
but it's complicated because they're all
 
01:17:52.390 --> 01:17:52.400 align:start position:0%
different asset owners some are the
 
01:17:55.070 --> 01:17:55.080 align:start position:0%
state or town or or private uh
 
01:17:57.310 --> 01:17:57.320 align:start position:0%
potentially so there's uh there's kind
 
01:17:59.669 --> 01:17:59.679 align:start position:0%
of a a big body of work there to figure
 
01:18:02.030 --> 01:18:02.040 align:start position:0%
out how to kind of where to
 
01:18:04.310 --> 01:18:04.320 align:start position:0%
start thank you sir any further
 
01:18:07.470 --> 01:18:07.480 align:start position:0%
questions yes please represent melin
 
01:18:08.990 --> 01:18:09.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
01:18:12.350 --> 01:18:12.360 align:start position:0%
taking my question if these CS are
 
01:18:16.189 --> 01:18:16.199 align:start position:0%
repaired uh or replaced what's the life
 
01:18:20.270 --> 01:18:20.280 align:start position:0%
expectancy of them on 100 or 200 year
 
01:18:24.310 --> 01:18:24.320 align:start position:0%
storm yeah I I think the there's um you
 
01:18:26.149 --> 01:18:26.159 align:start position:0%
know each case is a little bit different
 
01:18:27.629 --> 01:18:27.639 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that a lot of the
 
01:18:29.510 --> 01:18:29.520 align:start position:0%
concrete coverts have a lifespan of
 
01:18:33.149 --> 01:18:33.159 align:start position:0%
somewhere 75 or or 100 years um I'm not
 
01:18:35.590 --> 01:18:35.600 align:start position:0%
an expert so I I can't you speak to that
 
01:18:37.470 --> 01:18:37.480 align:start position:0%
or I'm not an engineer excuse me so I
 
01:18:39.149 --> 01:18:39.159 align:start position:0%
can't speak to that exactly but
 
01:18:40.629 --> 01:18:40.639 align:start position:0%
somewhere in you know there's a hope
 
01:18:42.310 --> 01:18:42.320 align:start position:0%
that a concrete Culver could last
 
01:18:45.750 --> 01:18:45.760 align:start position:0%
somewhere about 75 years thank you any
 
01:18:45.760 --> 01:18:46.990 align:start position:0%
somewhere about 75 years thank you any
further

01:18:46.990 --> 01:18:47.000 align:start position:0%
further
 
01:18:50.430 --> 01:18:50.440 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you is there
 
01:18:52.629 --> 01:18:52.639 align:start position:0%
anyone present wishes to speak a second
 
01:18:54.350 --> 01:18:54.360 align:start position:0%
time or someone that wanted to speak
 
01:18:56.669 --> 01:18:56.679 align:start position:0%
that had hasn't had the opportunity uh
 
01:19:01.750 --> 01:19:01.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:05.229 --> 01:19:05.239 align:start position:0%
543 seeing none blue sheet blue sheet if
 
01:19:09.350 --> 01:19:09.360 align:start position:0%
we could pass that along um yes please
 
01:19:09.360 --> 01:19:11.910 align:start position:0%
we could pass that along um yes please
represent

01:19:11.910 --> 01:19:11.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:15.149 --> 01:19:15.159 align:start position:0%
PFI could I speak with the dees person
 
01:19:16.830 --> 01:19:16.840 align:start position:0%
again certainly do you want to bring him
 
01:19:23.270 --> 01:19:23.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:25.990 --> 01:19:26.000 align:start position:0%
privately thank you for coming back up
 
01:19:28.750 --> 01:19:28.760 align:start position:0%
absolutely yes yes sir thank
 
01:19:32.189 --> 01:19:32.199 align:start position:0%
you I think the dees has always done a
 
01:19:32.199 --> 01:19:33.270 align:start position:0%
you I think the dees has always done a
great

01:19:33.270 --> 01:19:33.280 align:start position:0%
great
 
01:19:33.280 --> 01:19:36.870 align:start position:0%
great
job

01:19:36.870 --> 01:19:36.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:42.430 --> 01:19:42.440 align:start position:0%
okay I'm seeing this as a new level of
 
01:19:45.030 --> 01:19:45.040 align:start position:0%
bureaucracy because I'm I'm always happy
 
01:19:47.149 --> 01:19:47.159 align:start position:0%
with your
 
01:19:47.159 --> 01:19:49.790 align:start position:0%
with your
decisions

01:19:49.790 --> 01:19:49.800 align:start position:0%
decisions
 
01:19:52.350 --> 01:19:52.360 align:start position:0%
uh we pull pull you a little close just
 
01:19:55.510 --> 01:19:55.520 align:start position:0%
pull right you hear me yes yeah I
 
01:19:55.520 --> 01:20:01.270 align:start position:0%
pull right you hear me yes yeah I
okay

01:20:01.270 --> 01:20:01.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:04.550 --> 01:20:04.560 align:start position:0%
uh I just want to say thank you you you
 
01:20:07.709 --> 01:20:07.719 align:start position:0%
you've done a great job and uh I hope
 
01:20:10.470 --> 01:20:10.480 align:start position:0%
you continue to do it thank you I guess
 
01:20:11.590 --> 01:20:11.600 align:start position:0%
the sounded like there was a little bit
 
01:20:12.950 --> 01:20:12.960 align:start position:0%
of question about would this develop
 
01:20:15.470 --> 01:20:15.480 align:start position:0%
another layer of bureaucracy within an
 
01:20:18.470 --> 01:20:18.480 align:start position:0%
already um you know often bureaucratic
 
01:20:22.669 --> 01:20:22.679 align:start position:0%
process um in fact I think at uh uh
 
01:20:24.750 --> 01:20:24.760 align:start position:0%
Senator avard at a at a hearing last
 
01:20:26.950 --> 01:20:26.960 align:start position:0%
week um I think he sort of misspoke but
 
01:20:28.430 --> 01:20:28.440 align:start position:0%
he actually may have intended to call us
 
01:20:32.189 --> 01:20:32.199 align:start position:0%
the department of bureaucracy um which
 
01:20:36.910 --> 01:20:36.920 align:start position:0%
uh yeah anyway um so so I don't think so
 
01:20:38.229 --> 01:20:38.239 align:start position:0%
I don't think that that's the case I
 
01:20:39.910 --> 01:20:39.920 align:start position:0%
think that this you know and I and if
 
01:20:43.070 --> 01:20:43.080 align:start position:0%
you look at our letter we do actually
 
01:20:44.910 --> 01:20:44.920 align:start position:0%
think that if this commission is to go
 
01:20:48.790 --> 01:20:48.800 align:start position:0%
or commit Council sorry if this council
 
01:20:54.390 --> 01:20:54.400 align:start position:0%
is to go forward um that that the or the
 
01:20:56.350 --> 01:20:56.360 align:start position:0%
f focus at the outset really should be
 
01:20:58.189 --> 01:20:58.199 align:start position:0%
on making sure that the state agencies
 
01:21:00.750 --> 01:21:00.760 align:start position:0%
are well coordinated and so I think that
 
01:21:02.870 --> 01:21:02.880 align:start position:0%
that really is key and and that
 
01:21:05.709 --> 01:21:05.719 align:start position:0%
hopefully reduces bureaucracy uh over
 
01:21:07.750 --> 01:21:07.760 align:start position:0%
the long run but uh you know time will
