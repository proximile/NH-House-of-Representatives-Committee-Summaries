00:08:22.110 --> 00:08:22.120 align:start position:0%
open up the subcommittee
 
00:08:27.110 --> 00:08:27.120 align:start position:0%
so um I think we all understand the
 
00:08:30.909 --> 00:08:30.919 align:start position:0%
problem what the issue is here
 
00:08:32.909 --> 00:08:32.919 align:start position:0%
um so I don't want to spend too much
 
00:08:37.190 --> 00:08:37.200 align:start position:0%
time rehashing the hearing in terms of
 
00:08:40.589 --> 00:08:40.599 align:start position:0%
why we need to pass something to deal
 
00:08:43.350 --> 00:08:43.360 align:start position:0%
with this problem what I want to focus
 
00:08:46.310 --> 00:08:46.320 align:start position:0%
on is just distinguishing the three
 
00:08:50.910 --> 00:08:50.920 align:start position:0%
bills and what they do and then um uh
 
00:08:53.550 --> 00:08:53.560 align:start position:0%
see if we can find consensus to what is
 
00:08:55.790 --> 00:08:55.800 align:start position:0%
the right answer to go forward
 
00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:57.389 align:start position:0%
the right answer to go forward
with

00:08:57.389 --> 00:08:57.399 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:09:00.470 --> 00:09:00.480 align:start position:0%
so um
 
00:09:03.150 --> 00:09:03.160 align:start position:0%
first one is um relative to
 
00:09:07.630 --> 00:09:07.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:12.069 --> 00:09:12.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:12.079 --> 00:09:14.069 align:start position:0%
 
185

00:09:14.069 --> 00:09:14.079 align:start position:0%
185
 
00:09:18.150 --> 00:09:18.160 align:start position:0%
um in 185 does not set any particular
 
00:09:21.509 --> 00:09:21.519 align:start position:0%
rates other than that it mandates the
 
00:09:24.310 --> 00:09:24.320 align:start position:0%
insurance company
 
00:09:30.350 --> 00:09:30.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:33.230 --> 00:09:33.240 align:start position:0%
simple as that turn you know that there
 
00:09:36.750 --> 00:09:36.760 align:start position:0%
is no negotiation you know unless unless
 
00:09:38.949 --> 00:09:38.959 align:start position:0%
of course the the ambulance company
 
00:09:42.670 --> 00:09:42.680 align:start position:0%
actually had a contract with the um
 
00:09:45.949 --> 00:09:45.959 align:start position:0%
health insurance company um
 
00:09:48.949 --> 00:09:48.959 align:start position:0%
assuming they don't because they don't
 
00:09:52.509 --> 00:09:52.519 align:start position:0%
now for some of them and that so simply
 
00:09:55.949 --> 00:09:55.959 align:start position:0%
this says that uh whatever the ambulance
 
00:09:58.870 --> 00:09:58.880 align:start position:0%
company bills them the Ins Insurance
 
00:10:01.230 --> 00:10:01.240 align:start position:0%
company has to pay for
 
00:10:10.790 --> 00:10:10.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:12.790 --> 00:10:12.800 align:start position:0%
unfortunately you know I keep talking
 
00:10:16.350 --> 00:10:16.360 align:start position:0%
about just pay the bill where is it in
 
00:10:20.710 --> 00:10:20.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:26.230 --> 00:10:26.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:28.550 --> 00:10:28.560 align:start position:0%
company who who says they don't have to
 
00:10:30.829 --> 00:10:30.839 align:start position:0%
pay the bill well they
 
00:10:35.949 --> 00:10:35.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:39.629 --> 00:10:39.639 align:start position:0%
full do they they they pay what
 
00:10:42.750 --> 00:10:42.760 align:start position:0%
they what they want to pay right pretty
 
00:10:45.829 --> 00:10:45.839 align:start position:0%
much that's the way I see
 
00:10:48.670 --> 00:10:48.680 align:start position:0%
it you send them a bill for x and they
 
00:10:52.430 --> 00:10:52.440 align:start position:0%
pay y right well they they have I don't
 
00:10:54.750 --> 00:10:54.760 align:start position:0%
know any other place that that happens
 
00:10:58.269 --> 00:10:58.279 align:start position:0%
okay so Mr chair yes represent may I put
 
00:11:02.190 --> 00:11:02.200 align:start position:0%
something in um isn't the problem that
 
00:11:04.990 --> 00:11:05.000 align:start position:0%
the entity being buil is not the
 
00:11:07.269 --> 00:11:07.279 align:start position:0%
insurance company the entity being built
 
00:11:09.550 --> 00:11:09.560 align:start position:0%
is the patient and the patient is
 
00:11:11.430 --> 00:11:11.440 align:start position:0%
obligated to pay the bill but the
 
00:11:14.710 --> 00:11:14.720 align:start position:0%
insurance company um only is obligated
 
00:11:17.430 --> 00:11:17.440 align:start position:0%
to pay at least according to them what
 
00:11:19.949 --> 00:11:19.959 align:start position:0%
they've contracted for and most of the
 
00:11:22.230 --> 00:11:22.240 align:start position:0%
um ambulance providers uh in New
 
00:11:24.509 --> 00:11:24.519 align:start position:0%
Hampshire are outside the contract and
 
00:11:31.190 --> 00:11:31.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:33.949 --> 00:11:33.959 align:start position:0%
so no
 
00:11:38.069 --> 00:11:38.079 align:start position:0%
contract there's no deal to pay
 
00:11:40.870 --> 00:11:40.880 align:start position:0%
less and if they're representing that
 
00:11:43.230 --> 00:11:43.240 align:start position:0%
patient for the
 
00:11:45.990 --> 00:11:46.000 align:start position:0%
bill then they should be paying that I
 
00:11:47.870 --> 00:11:47.880 align:start position:0%
know if my insurance company doesn't pay
 
00:11:49.269 --> 00:11:49.279 align:start position:0%
my ambulance bill I'm going to be
 
00:11:52.829 --> 00:11:52.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:56.269 --> 00:11:56.279 align:start position:0%
why representative sharesa you have a
 
00:11:59.069 --> 00:11:59.079 align:start position:0%
question uh b i I just want to
 
00:12:00.030 --> 00:12:00.040 align:start position:0%
understand and I mean this is a
 
00:12:01.470 --> 00:12:01.480 align:start position:0%
subcommittee we are going to talk about
 
00:12:03.110 --> 00:12:03.120 align:start position:0%
or is it like is it's not not a hearing
 
00:12:04.870 --> 00:12:04.880 align:start position:0%
right this is not a hearing this is a
 
00:12:07.829 --> 00:12:07.839 align:start position:0%
casual conversation trying to try to
 
00:12:11.269 --> 00:12:11.279 align:start position:0%
among friends so so I I have like some
 
00:12:13.790 --> 00:12:13.800 align:start position:0%
basic question itself on on this
 
00:12:18.470 --> 00:12:18.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:20.750 --> 00:12:20.760 align:start position:0%
uh an insurance shall provide
 
00:12:22.150 --> 00:12:22.160 align:start position:0%
reimbursement for ambulance survey at
 
00:12:23.670 --> 00:12:23.680 align:start position:0%
the rate negotiated between the insurer
 
00:12:26.150 --> 00:12:26.160 align:start position:0%
and the ambulance service provider so if
 
00:12:30.069 --> 00:12:30.079 align:start position:0%
the ambulance service is in network
 
00:12:33.150 --> 00:12:33.160 align:start position:0%
with the insurance company that's that's
 
00:12:34.550 --> 00:12:34.560 align:start position:0%
the easiest part because they must have
 
00:12:36.910 --> 00:12:36.920 align:start position:0%
a contractor rate between them correct
 
00:12:39.269 --> 00:12:39.279 align:start position:0%
if but so and in that case probably it
 
00:12:42.069 --> 00:12:42.079 align:start position:0%
might be 50% less than
 
00:12:44.550 --> 00:12:44.560 align:start position:0%
50% what what were the insurance company
 
00:12:46.750 --> 00:12:46.760 align:start position:0%
and the provide on the ambulance
 
00:12:49.350 --> 00:12:49.360 align:start position:0%
services understood as reasonable
 
00:12:51.829 --> 00:12:51.839 align:start position:0%
because seems to me the rates are not
 
00:12:54.110 --> 00:12:54.120 align:start position:0%
regulated right now rate can be set by
 
00:12:55.829 --> 00:12:55.839 align:start position:0%
the ambulance company whatever rate they
 
00:12:58.509 --> 00:12:58.519 align:start position:0%
want so the problem here I see that in
 
00:13:00.670 --> 00:13:00.680 align:start position:0%
the absence next line in the absence of
 
00:13:02.189 --> 00:13:02.199 align:start position:0%
agreed upon rate an insurance shall pay
 
00:13:03.629 --> 00:13:03.639 align:start position:0%
the amount built by the ambulance
 
00:13:06.030 --> 00:13:06.040 align:start position:0%
services provider for the service so if
 
00:13:08.269 --> 00:13:08.279 align:start position:0%
it's out of network then there is no
 
00:13:10.790 --> 00:13:10.800 align:start position:0%
contracted uh amount and now with this
 
00:13:13.670 --> 00:13:13.680 align:start position:0%
bill you are saying that if suppose the
 
00:13:16.069 --> 00:13:16.079 align:start position:0%
ambulance service charge $100 for a
 
00:13:19.670 --> 00:13:19.680 align:start position:0%
particular service now in network
 
00:13:21.509 --> 00:13:21.519 align:start position:0%
provider because they might have
 
00:13:23.509 --> 00:13:23.519 align:start position:0%
contract let's say pay
 
00:13:26.150 --> 00:13:26.160 align:start position:0%
$60 then they'll pay $60 and both the
 
00:13:28.949 --> 00:13:28.959 align:start position:0%
party are fine if it's out of network
 
00:13:31.069 --> 00:13:31.079 align:start position:0%
and ambulance now you're saying that
 
00:13:33.150 --> 00:13:33.160 align:start position:0%
it's $100 bill the insurance company has
 
00:13:35.550 --> 00:13:35.560 align:start position:0%
to pay $100 bill which is not fair
 
00:13:37.910 --> 00:13:37.920 align:start position:0%
because it's it's the same service and
 
00:13:40.189 --> 00:13:40.199 align:start position:0%
we are now encouraging the out of
 
00:13:42.590 --> 00:13:42.600 align:start position:0%
network ambulance provider to get more
 
00:13:45.389 --> 00:13:45.399 align:start position:0%
from the insurance company I think I can
 
00:13:47.430 --> 00:13:47.440 align:start position:0%
assure you that most of the ambulance
 
00:13:50.230 --> 00:13:50.240 align:start position:0%
companies are not in network because
 
00:13:53.310 --> 00:13:53.320 align:start position:0%
they cannot survive on what the
 
00:13:56.509 --> 00:13:56.519 align:start position:0%
insurance company is offering in network
 
00:13:59.590 --> 00:13:59.600 align:start position:0%
payments just can't happen and they keep
 
00:14:02.350 --> 00:14:02.360 align:start position:0%
dangling this in front of us because
 
00:14:03.870 --> 00:14:03.880 align:start position:0%
they're supposed to be able to push more
 
00:14:06.310 --> 00:14:06.320 align:start position:0%
patients to them that's what in network
 
00:14:08.189 --> 00:14:08.199 align:start position:0%
does right you're in that Network we're
 
00:14:10.749 --> 00:14:10.759 align:start position:0%
going to push patients towards you we're
 
00:14:13.590 --> 00:14:13.600 align:start position:0%
an emergency service when they're laying
 
00:14:15.269 --> 00:14:15.279 align:start position:0%
up upside down in their car and they're
 
00:14:16.710 --> 00:14:16.720 align:start position:0%
not calling the insurance company and
 
00:14:18.470 --> 00:14:18.480 align:start position:0%
saying hey which Ambulance Service
 
00:14:21.350 --> 00:14:21.360 align:start position:0%
should I call you dial 911 and we're
 
00:14:24.910 --> 00:14:24.920 align:start position:0%
coming to get you being in network does
 
00:14:27.829 --> 00:14:27.839 align:start position:0%
nothing for us except get us less money
 
00:14:29.509 --> 00:14:29.519 align:start position:0%
I just I just want to clarify one thing
 
00:14:32.629 --> 00:14:32.639 align:start position:0%
that you know I I know one thing that
 
00:14:35.069 --> 00:14:35.079 align:start position:0%
the ambulance service providers they are
 
00:14:37.949 --> 00:14:37.959 align:start position:0%
doing essential service for
 
00:14:41.629 --> 00:14:41.639 align:start position:0%
medical and and this a required service
 
00:14:43.189 --> 00:14:43.199 align:start position:0%
I also want to help the ambulance
 
00:14:45.069 --> 00:14:45.079 align:start position:0%
company but there are few things that
 
00:14:47.150 --> 00:14:47.160 align:start position:0%
are there in the bills and seems like
 
00:14:48.790 --> 00:14:48.800 align:start position:0%
the ambulance company they want both
 
00:14:53.189 --> 00:14:53.199 align:start position:0%
ways which is you know they they they
 
00:14:55.870 --> 00:14:55.880 align:start position:0%
first of all I saw some other bills you
 
00:14:57.550 --> 00:14:57.560 align:start position:0%
know that that says that there should be
 
00:15:01.069 --> 00:15:01.079 align:start position:0%
some some over it on what kind of rate
 
00:15:02.670 --> 00:15:02.680 align:start position:0%
is being charged for a particular
 
00:15:04.949 --> 00:15:04.959 align:start position:0%
service I I had asked that question even
 
00:15:07.069 --> 00:15:07.079 align:start position:0%
uh in one of the hearing to when
 
00:15:09.790 --> 00:15:09.800 align:start position:0%
gentlemen that uh why the rates for the
 
00:15:12.310 --> 00:15:12.320 align:start position:0%
same service is different from two
 
00:15:14.189 --> 00:15:14.199 align:start position:0%
different ambulance companies because
 
00:15:16.110 --> 00:15:16.120 align:start position:0%
the same service and there's no answer
 
00:15:18.430 --> 00:15:18.440 align:start position:0%
for that now the thing is that yeah in
 
00:15:21.150 --> 00:15:21.160 align:start position:0%
in a in a capitalistic model you can put
 
00:15:24.150 --> 00:15:24.160 align:start position:0%
any amount to any service you want but
 
00:15:27.629 --> 00:15:27.639 align:start position:0%
here we are talking about you know uh
 
00:15:30.389 --> 00:15:30.399 align:start position:0%
using uh State influence or using a
 
00:15:33.550 --> 00:15:33.560 align:start position:0%
regulatory body now to kind of the I
 
00:15:34.870 --> 00:15:34.880 align:start position:0%
mean bail out in the right word but it's
 
00:15:36.470 --> 00:15:36.480 align:start position:0%
kind of bail out that okay you help the
 
00:15:39.230 --> 00:15:39.240 align:start position:0%
insurance you you help the ambulance
 
00:15:43.150 --> 00:15:43.160 align:start position:0%
services to survive and I do want it to
 
00:15:45.189 --> 00:15:45.199 align:start position:0%
survive and not only survive but do a
 
00:15:48.629 --> 00:15:48.639 align:start position:0%
good job but then they also should be uh
 
00:15:51.350 --> 00:15:51.360 align:start position:0%
monitored by certain regulatory body so
 
00:15:53.150 --> 00:15:53.160 align:start position:0%
in terms of setting the rates you
 
00:15:54.910 --> 00:15:54.920 align:start position:0%
realize that 90% of the people that
 
00:15:57.110 --> 00:15:57.120 align:start position:0%
you're talking about are fire
 
00:16:01.189 --> 00:16:01.199 align:start position:0%
departments run by the cities and towns
 
00:16:04.430 --> 00:16:04.440 align:start position:0%
that are not for profit and we're just
 
00:16:06.990 --> 00:16:07.000 align:start position:0%
trying to cover the T cost of that
 
00:16:09.470 --> 00:16:09.480 align:start position:0%
taking the burden off some of our
 
00:16:12.389 --> 00:16:12.399 align:start position:0%
taxpayers is what that is about right
 
00:16:14.389 --> 00:16:14.399 align:start position:0%
it's not about us making all kinds of
 
00:16:17.509 --> 00:16:17.519 align:start position:0%
money we're just trying to take the
 
00:16:20.990 --> 00:16:21.000 align:start position:0%
burden off the taxpayer because it's
 
00:16:25.870 --> 00:16:25.880 align:start position:0%
not a a if somebody gets sick or injured
 
00:16:28.069 --> 00:16:28.079 align:start position:0%
it doesn't affect the whole town like a
 
00:16:29.590 --> 00:16:29.600 align:start position:0%
fire does right right that's why the
 
00:16:31.389 --> 00:16:31.399 align:start position:0%
fire department's there because if we
 
00:16:33.710 --> 00:16:33.720 align:start position:0%
don't show up the whole town burns down
 
00:16:36.990 --> 00:16:37.000 align:start position:0%
so yeah that's a taxpayer burden right
 
00:16:39.269 --> 00:16:39.279 align:start position:0%
but the ambulance is not a taxpayer
 
00:16:42.509 --> 00:16:42.519 align:start position:0%
burden it's that person's burden right
 
00:16:44.309 --> 00:16:44.319 align:start position:0%
and the town is nice enough to set this
 
00:16:47.710 --> 00:16:47.720 align:start position:0%
up but we have to cover some of the cost
 
00:16:49.509 --> 00:16:49.519 align:start position:0%
we're not here to make money we're not
 
00:16:51.430 --> 00:16:51.440 align:start position:0%
here to put the insurance company out of
 
00:16:54.389 --> 00:16:54.399 align:start position:0%
business the the ambulance line in the
 
00:16:58.069 --> 00:16:58.079 align:start position:0%
insurance company is like 2% it's not a
 
00:16:59.670 --> 00:16:59.680 align:start position:0%
big bill for that
 
00:17:01.430 --> 00:17:01.440 align:start position:0%
but apparently this is the hill they're
 
00:17:02.629 --> 00:17:02.639 align:start position:0%
going to die
 
00:17:04.829 --> 00:17:04.839 align:start position:0%
on and I think I already answered that
 
00:17:06.630 --> 00:17:06.640 align:start position:0%
question in the beginning so I said that
 
00:17:08.510 --> 00:17:08.520 align:start position:0%
we are definitely because this is
 
00:17:11.789 --> 00:17:11.799 align:start position:0%
considered to be a essential service and
 
00:17:13.990 --> 00:17:14.000 align:start position:0%
this needs to not only survive but this
 
00:17:16.189 --> 00:17:16.199 align:start position:0%
also needs to thrive and do a good
 
00:17:17.750 --> 00:17:17.760 align:start position:0%
business there's no question on that
 
00:17:19.110 --> 00:17:19.120 align:start position:0%
that's why we're all here to survive the
 
00:17:20.630 --> 00:17:20.640 align:start position:0%
thing is that what is but but the
 
00:17:21.870 --> 00:17:21.880 align:start position:0%
question to and I still didn't get
 
00:17:24.669 --> 00:17:24.679 align:start position:0%
answer from any of even is that what is
 
00:17:27.590 --> 00:17:27.600 align:start position:0%
the harm or what is the objection in
 
00:17:29.950 --> 00:17:29.960 align:start position:0%
having the rate schedule of the
 
00:17:32.110 --> 00:17:32.120 align:start position:0%
ambulance service to be seen by
 
00:17:33.830 --> 00:17:33.840 align:start position:0%
oversight committee or maybe Insurance
 
00:17:35.870 --> 00:17:35.880 align:start position:0%
some committee I don't know somebody so
 
00:17:38.789 --> 00:17:38.799 align:start position:0%
that the ambulance company do not bill
 
00:17:41.710 --> 00:17:41.720 align:start position:0%
just like that uh to you know because I
 
00:17:42.990 --> 00:17:43.000 align:start position:0%
have seen the Medical Billing System in
 
00:17:44.710 --> 00:17:44.720 align:start position:0%
general when you go to any medical
 
00:17:46.350 --> 00:17:46.360 align:start position:0%
service you go to a primary care
 
00:17:48.270 --> 00:17:48.280 align:start position:0%
physician for one vigit 10 10 minutes
 
00:17:50.990 --> 00:17:51.000 align:start position:0%
viget they charge $400 to the insurance
 
00:17:52.830 --> 00:17:52.840 align:start position:0%
company insurance company pays $200
 
00:17:55.110 --> 00:17:55.120 align:start position:0%
maybe maybe less and if you pay cash it
 
00:17:56.669 --> 00:17:56.679 align:start position:0%
might be less than that the point I'm
 
00:17:58.830 --> 00:17:58.840 align:start position:0%
trying to say is that what is the approp
 
00:18:02.350 --> 00:18:02.360 align:start position:0%
roate value of that service because you
 
00:18:04.909 --> 00:18:04.919 align:start position:0%
know obviously the med the medical
 
00:18:06.830 --> 00:18:06.840 align:start position:0%
system is surviving with the insurance
 
00:18:08.630 --> 00:18:08.640 align:start position:0%
company payment to them and not only
 
00:18:09.750 --> 00:18:09.760 align:start position:0%
surviv they are doing they're making
 
00:18:12.789 --> 00:18:12.799 align:start position:0%
profits too but so the the what I'm
 
00:18:14.230 --> 00:18:14.240 align:start position:0%
struggling is that again I'm not expert
 
00:18:16.750 --> 00:18:16.760 align:start position:0%
in the ambulance billing and I all I
 
00:18:18.549 --> 00:18:18.559 align:start position:0%
know in general is
 
00:18:20.669 --> 00:18:20.679 align:start position:0%
that there is a lot of overbilling
 
00:18:23.549 --> 00:18:23.559 align:start position:0%
happens in medical sub system and I'm
 
00:18:25.350 --> 00:18:25.360 align:start position:0%
not saying ambulance system is a part of
 
00:18:27.390 --> 00:18:27.400 align:start position:0%
that or it could be I do not know you
 
00:18:29.750 --> 00:18:29.760 align:start position:0%
have to educate me on that but I feel
 
00:18:32.350 --> 00:18:32.360 align:start position:0%
that when somebody sets the rate an
 
00:18:34.310 --> 00:18:34.320 align:start position:0%
ambulance an insurance company sets the
 
00:18:37.830 --> 00:18:37.840 align:start position:0%
rate or somebody sets the rate I mean it
 
00:18:39.870 --> 00:18:39.880 align:start position:0%
it will be totally not only unfair
 
00:18:42.350 --> 00:18:42.360 align:start position:0%
unrealistic that hey if if a glass of
 
00:18:44.870 --> 00:18:44.880 align:start position:0%
water cost a dollar I'll say okay I'll
 
00:18:47.110 --> 00:18:47.120 align:start position:0%
dictate I'll pay only 10 cents insurance
 
00:18:48.270 --> 00:18:48.280 align:start position:0%
companies cannot say like that I'll pay
 
00:18:50.070 --> 00:18:50.080 align:start position:0%
only 10 cents that's nego they have to
 
00:18:52.310 --> 00:18:52.320 align:start position:0%
be reasonable when when when a contract
 
00:18:53.990 --> 00:18:54.000 align:start position:0%
happen between ambulance company and
 
00:18:56.350 --> 00:18:56.360 align:start position:0%
insurance company I'm sure both the
 
00:18:59.070 --> 00:18:59.080 align:start position:0%
parties talk about the realistic cost of
 
00:19:01.549 --> 00:19:01.559 align:start position:0%
the class of bottle now ambulance say no
 
00:19:03.549 --> 00:19:03.559 align:start position:0%
I'll charge five bucks insurance company
 
00:19:05.310 --> 00:19:05.320 align:start position:0%
say no I'll pay 50 cents that's not
 
00:19:07.350 --> 00:19:07.360 align:start position:0%
reasonable so what I'm trying to
 
00:19:09.669 --> 00:19:09.679 align:start position:0%
struggle here is that when the insurance
 
00:19:11.830 --> 00:19:11.840 align:start position:0%
company and again it's in network and
 
00:19:14.070 --> 00:19:14.080 align:start position:0%
out network is different ball game when
 
00:19:16.110 --> 00:19:16.120 align:start position:0%
when the insurance company negotiates
 
00:19:19.190 --> 00:19:19.200 align:start position:0%
the rate with the ambulance provider why
 
00:19:22.510 --> 00:19:22.520 align:start position:0%
they will force the ambulance provider
 
00:19:24.909 --> 00:19:24.919 align:start position:0%
to be paid so less that they can't
 
00:19:28.710 --> 00:19:28.720 align:start position:0%
survive I mean no nobody is blind I mean
 
00:19:30.029 --> 00:19:30.039 align:start position:0%
even insurance company understands that
 
00:19:32.830 --> 00:19:32.840 align:start position:0%
part that for this service of a glass of
 
00:19:35.310 --> 00:19:35.320 align:start position:0%
water which called a dollar you have to
 
00:19:36.710 --> 00:19:36.720 align:start position:0%
pay something around a dollar you can't
 
00:19:40.110 --> 00:19:40.120 align:start position:0%
pay 10 cents correct so why tell you
 
00:19:41.950 --> 00:19:41.960 align:start position:0%
it's a dollar so why do you say pay it's
 
00:19:44.909 --> 00:19:44.919 align:start position:0%
a dollar we're not we're not trying to
 
00:19:47.149 --> 00:19:47.159 align:start position:0%
charge $5 for the bottle yeah we're
 
00:19:48.990 --> 00:19:49.000 align:start position:0%
trying to charge a dollar for the bottle
 
00:19:52.390 --> 00:19:52.400 align:start position:0%
so why they want to pay us 10 cents okay
 
00:19:54.750 --> 00:19:54.760 align:start position:0%
you got a point right I mean I I
 
00:19:57.430 --> 00:19:57.440 align:start position:0%
think has to the reason we're not in
 
00:19:59.510 --> 00:19:59.520 align:start position:0%
network cuz they want give us the 10
 
00:20:01.909 --> 00:20:01.919 align:start position:0%
cents and we want the dollar okay we
 
00:20:03.750 --> 00:20:03.760 align:start position:0%
need the dollar not that we want so then
 
00:20:05.430 --> 00:20:05.440 align:start position:0%
that needs to be looked upon by some
 
00:20:07.350 --> 00:20:07.360 align:start position:0%
regulatory body unfortunately this
 
00:20:09.590 --> 00:20:09.600 align:start position:0%
situation is not as simple as that there
 
00:20:11.909 --> 00:20:11.919 align:start position:0%
are other factors involved and I think
 
00:20:13.310 --> 00:20:13.320 align:start position:0%
we should move on a little bit because
 
00:20:16.190 --> 00:20:16.200 align:start position:0%
we got to touch on all those factors
 
00:20:19.510 --> 00:20:19.520 align:start position:0%
make a decision is the reason that there
 
00:20:22.270 --> 00:20:22.280 align:start position:0%
are different costs um in different
 
00:20:25.149 --> 00:20:25.159 align:start position:0%
areas for ambulance service is that the
 
00:20:27.350 --> 00:20:27.360 align:start position:0%
actual cost of running the ambulance
 
00:20:29.430 --> 00:20:29.440 align:start position:0%
service is different in different
 
00:20:32.430 --> 00:20:32.440 align:start position:0%
different areas as particularly in rural
 
00:20:36.430 --> 00:20:36.440 align:start position:0%
areas the costs are higher because the
 
00:20:39.149 --> 00:20:39.159 align:start position:0%
um the geographical area that they cover
 
00:20:41.510 --> 00:20:41.520 align:start position:0%
is much bigger and at the same time the
 
00:20:44.350 --> 00:20:44.360 align:start position:0%
number of coals is smaller but they
 
00:20:47.230 --> 00:20:47.240 align:start position:0%
still have to maintain service 24 hours
 
00:20:51.669 --> 00:20:51.679 align:start position:0%
a day 7 days a week 365 days a year and
 
00:20:55.070 --> 00:20:55.080 align:start position:0%
so the cost for each service has to be
 
00:20:57.390 --> 00:20:57.400 align:start position:0%
higher isn't that isn't that the issue
 
00:20:59.549 --> 00:20:59.559 align:start position:0%
we're dealing with
 
00:21:01.070 --> 00:21:01.080 align:start position:0%
that's only part of the
 
00:21:04.990 --> 00:21:05.000 align:start position:0%
issue yes only part of the issue because
 
00:21:08.070 --> 00:21:08.080 align:start position:0%
up north they may pay their people a
 
00:21:10.070 --> 00:21:10.080 align:start position:0%
little bit less but because of the
 
00:21:11.870 --> 00:21:11.880 align:start position:0%
competition down south they have to pay
 
00:21:15.470 --> 00:21:15.480 align:start position:0%
their people more so oh you back up to
 
00:21:20.029 --> 00:21:20.039 align:start position:0%
the same cost so yeah we did a a a big
 
00:21:21.870 --> 00:21:21.880 align:start position:0%
survey here in the state and the FEDS
 
00:21:24.310 --> 00:21:24.320 align:start position:0%
did a big survey to come up with the
 
00:21:26.470 --> 00:21:26.480 align:start position:0%
actual cost of what it cost to run the
 
00:21:30.310 --> 00:21:30.320 align:start position:0%
ambulance and nobody seems to care about
 
00:21:33.470 --> 00:21:33.480 align:start position:0%
that okay
 
00:21:35.990 --> 00:21:36.000 align:start position:0%
so did you have anything else you want
 
00:21:37.950 --> 00:21:37.960 align:start position:0%
more to say representative spear Gibbs
 
00:21:39.470 --> 00:21:39.480 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I said what I wanted to say
 
00:21:42.350 --> 00:21:42.360 align:start position:0%
thank you okay all right representative
 
00:21:44.190 --> 00:21:44.200 align:start position:0%
Spear and
 
00:21:46.950 --> 00:21:46.960 align:start position:0%
then I wanted to go over this um
 
00:21:48.950 --> 00:21:48.960 align:start position:0%
analysis that uh the insurance
 
00:21:51.470 --> 00:21:51.480 align:start position:0%
department did for me but I we're not on
 
00:21:53.350 --> 00:21:53.360 align:start position:0%
that bill yet so right so right now what
 
00:21:55.269 --> 00:21:55.279 align:start position:0%
I want to do is make sure we understand
 
00:21:58.029 --> 00:21:58.039 align:start position:0%
what all three bills do and that we can
 
00:21:59.990 --> 00:22:00.000 align:start position:0%
then disc discuss the pros and cons of
 
00:22:02.669 --> 00:22:02.679 align:start position:0%
each but once we once we all understand
 
00:22:05.430 --> 00:22:05.440 align:start position:0%
so does everybody understand what
 
00:22:08.950 --> 00:22:08.960 align:start position:0%
representative PR House Bill 185 does
 
00:22:10.269 --> 00:22:10.279 align:start position:0%
everybody but I still have one question
 
00:22:12.630 --> 00:22:12.640 align:start position:0%
on the last line in that in the bill and
 
00:22:14.830 --> 00:22:14.840 align:start position:0%
maybe you know someone can answer it
 
00:22:17.070 --> 00:22:17.080 align:start position:0%
says the provisions of this section
 
00:22:19.470 --> 00:22:19.480 align:start position:0%
shall not apply to policies that do not
 
00:22:22.750 --> 00:22:22.760 align:start position:0%
include coverage for ambulance
 
00:22:22.760 --> 00:22:24.350 align:start position:0%
include coverage for ambulance
services

00:22:24.350 --> 00:22:24.360 align:start position:0%
services
 
00:22:27.549 --> 00:22:27.559 align:start position:0%
so so this what is that supposed to mean
 
00:22:29.110 --> 00:22:29.120 align:start position:0%
representative this
 
00:22:30.750 --> 00:22:30.760 align:start position:0%
I'll have to read it I don't have it
 
00:22:33.070 --> 00:22:33.080 align:start position:0%
says the provisions of this
 
00:22:35.789 --> 00:22:35.799 align:start position:0%
section this is uh in the church shall
 
00:22:38.230 --> 00:22:38.240 align:start position:0%
provide reimbursement no it's it's in
 
00:22:40.310 --> 00:22:40.320 align:start position:0%
all three paragraph both I can read
 
00:22:42.549 --> 00:22:42.559 align:start position:0%
again if you want okay so one is one is
 
00:22:45.190 --> 00:22:45.200 align:start position:0%
um is for the uh I assume group and one
 
00:22:47.990 --> 00:22:48.000 align:start position:0%
is for individual so it says that the
 
00:22:49.909 --> 00:22:49.919 align:start position:0%
provisions of the sh shall not apply to
 
00:22:51.950 --> 00:22:51.960 align:start position:0%
policies that do not include coverage
 
00:22:54.470 --> 00:22:54.480 align:start position:0%
for ambulet so that means that you there
 
00:22:57.630 --> 00:22:57.640 align:start position:0%
could be a health insurance policy that
 
00:23:00.470 --> 00:23:00.480 align:start position:0%
is specifically excludes Ambulance
 
00:23:02.909 --> 00:23:02.919 align:start position:0%
Service I've never heard of one have you
 
00:23:04.630 --> 00:23:04.640 align:start position:0%
ever heard of one that did
 
00:23:06.830 --> 00:23:06.840 align:start position:0%
that so where the hell did that come
 
00:23:08.870 --> 00:23:08.880 align:start position:0%
from I'm sure there's one out there oh
 
00:23:11.870 --> 00:23:11.880 align:start position:0%
you sure okay
 
00:23:14.830 --> 00:23:14.840 align:start position:0%
so question should that be mandated say
 
00:23:17.470 --> 00:23:17.480 align:start position:0%
he's saying that that was put in there
 
00:23:20.230 --> 00:23:20.240 align:start position:0%
as a dis that that obviously if your
 
00:23:23.669 --> 00:23:23.679 align:start position:0%
policy doesn't have ambulance coverage
 
00:23:27.510 --> 00:23:27.520 align:start position:0%
then this paragraph won't apply so so
 
00:23:29.830 --> 00:23:29.840 align:start position:0%
let me ask another question that is it
 
00:23:32.710 --> 00:23:32.720 align:start position:0%
is it mandated uh and again I think
 
00:23:34.950 --> 00:23:34.960 align:start position:0%
there is no ambulance mandate at this
 
00:23:36.390 --> 00:23:36.400 align:start position:0%
point in our stat no no I'm saying that
 
00:23:37.950 --> 00:23:37.960 align:start position:0%
the insurance department person is here
 
00:23:40.029 --> 00:23:40.039 align:start position:0%
also maybe is it mandator that all the
 
00:23:43.750 --> 00:23:43.760 align:start position:0%
insurance has to cover Ambulance Service
 
00:23:46.470 --> 00:23:46.480 align:start position:0%
okay so is it a is it a mandated
 
00:23:49.789 --> 00:23:49.799 align:start position:0%
coverage or you know what I hate to do
 
00:23:51.310 --> 00:23:51.320 align:start position:0%
this to but I think you need to have a
 
00:23:56.710 --> 00:23:56.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:58.950 --> 00:23:58.960 align:start position:0%
microphone okay right why don't you
 
00:24:00.269 --> 00:24:00.279 align:start position:0%
introduce yourself so everybody in the
 
00:24:01.990 --> 00:24:02.000 align:start position:0%
committee knows who you
 
00:24:04.110 --> 00:24:04.120 align:start position:0%
are hi I'm Michelle he and I'm the
 
00:24:05.230 --> 00:24:05.240 align:start position:0%
director of Life and Health at New
 
00:24:07.230 --> 00:24:07.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire insurance department and she's
 
00:24:09.269 --> 00:24:09.279 align:start position:0%
their legal beagle okay she's their
 
00:24:13.190 --> 00:24:13.200 align:start position:0%
legal counsel so yes so just to clarify
 
00:24:16.350 --> 00:24:16.360 align:start position:0%
Emergency Services is an essential um
 
00:24:19.269 --> 00:24:19.279 align:start position:0%
considered service so it would be
 
00:24:20.950 --> 00:24:20.960 align:start position:0%
covered under it's part of our Benchmark
 
00:24:22.909 --> 00:24:22.919 align:start position:0%
plan so it's going to be covered in
 
00:24:24.350 --> 00:24:24.360 align:start position:0%
pretty much all there is no health
 
00:24:26.470 --> 00:24:26.480 align:start position:0%
insurance plan now that does not have
 
00:24:28.789 --> 00:24:28.799 align:start position:0%
this we have no health insurance health
 
00:24:30.310 --> 00:24:30.320 align:start position:0%
insurance that is a meaningless line
 
00:24:30.320 --> 00:24:31.350 align:start position:0%
insurance that is a meaningless line
thank

00:24:31.350 --> 00:24:31.360 align:start position:0%
thank
 
00:24:33.750 --> 00:24:33.760 align:start position:0%
you they don't need next time you put
 
00:24:35.149 --> 00:24:35.159 align:start position:0%
this bill in make sure you don't put
 
00:24:37.230 --> 00:24:37.240 align:start position:0%
that sentence hey they put
 
00:24:40.669 --> 00:24:40.679 align:start position:0%
in I'm just trying to make it in you
 
00:24:42.990 --> 00:24:43.000 align:start position:0%
know all right so everybody's okay with
 
00:24:45.230 --> 00:24:45.240 align:start position:0%
understanding what 185 does yep all
 
00:24:49.870 --> 00:24:49.880 align:start position:0%
right good next is uh 36 well let's do
 
00:24:53.470 --> 00:24:53.480 align:start position:0%
before we do 316 let's do
 
00:25:01.590 --> 00:25:01.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:03.310 --> 00:25:03.320 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:25:06.310 --> 00:25:06.320 align:start position:0%
so see sponsors
 
00:25:09.830 --> 00:25:09.840 align:start position:0%
here uh so what we understand when we
 
00:25:11.269 --> 00:25:11.279 align:start position:0%
read this
 
00:25:16.230 --> 00:25:16.240 align:start position:0%
bill is that the magic number is
 
00:25:16.240 --> 00:25:17.750 align:start position:0%
bill is that the magic number is
325

00:25:17.750 --> 00:25:17.760 align:start position:0%
325
 
00:25:21.510 --> 00:25:21.520 align:start position:0%
per of Medicare rate of Medicare
 
00:25:23.789 --> 00:25:23.799 align:start position:0%
rate is there anything else we need to
 
00:25:26.590 --> 00:25:26.600 align:start position:0%
know more than
 
00:25:29.230 --> 00:25:29.240 align:start position:0%
that I I'm saying was there is that is
 
00:25:32.029 --> 00:25:32.039 align:start position:0%
in that the Salient item is that that
 
00:25:33.909 --> 00:25:33.919 align:start position:0%
the reimbursement rate we're going to
 
00:25:35.909 --> 00:25:35.919 align:start position:0%
mandate the rate must be
 
00:25:40.669 --> 00:25:40.679 align:start position:0%
300 25% it's yes it's 325 for a
 
00:25:44.190 --> 00:25:44.200 align:start position:0%
non-contract assuming that 325 per of
 
00:25:47.029 --> 00:25:47.039 align:start position:0%
the Medicare rate is higher than what
 
00:25:50.549 --> 00:25:50.559 align:start position:0%
they charge which is uh not the case for
 
00:25:52.389 --> 00:25:52.399 align:start position:0%
what do you mean by charge what what
 
00:25:54.990 --> 00:25:55.000 align:start position:0%
what the ambulance service provider oh
 
00:25:56.470 --> 00:25:56.480 align:start position:0%
so the ambulance company could build
 
00:25:58.789 --> 00:25:58.799 align:start position:0%
something less than 325 but we're
 
00:26:00.470 --> 00:26:00.480 align:start position:0%
assuming that the that the you're
 
00:26:02.510 --> 00:26:02.520 align:start position:0%
billing they're billing more than the
 
00:26:05.830 --> 00:26:05.840 align:start position:0%
325 and so therefore this sets a floor
 
00:26:08.350 --> 00:26:08.360 align:start position:0%
to how much the insurance company has to
 
00:26:13.310 --> 00:26:13.320 align:start position:0%
pay uh it sets a uh a ceiling right I
 
00:26:16.149 --> 00:26:16.159 align:start position:0%
the Char if the charges less than than
 
00:26:18.990 --> 00:26:19.000 align:start position:0%
the 325 they would pay the charges and
 
00:26:20.830 --> 00:26:20.840 align:start position:0%
and there are some ambulance providers
 
00:26:22.950 --> 00:26:22.960 align:start position:0%
that would charge less than this amount
 
00:26:25.870 --> 00:26:25.880 align:start position:0%
according to the things I looked at see
 
00:26:27.789 --> 00:26:27.799 align:start position:0%
if it was a ceiling you would disguise
 
00:26:30.269 --> 00:26:30.279 align:start position:0%
the limit right they could pay whatever
 
00:26:33.110 --> 00:26:33.120 align:start position:0%
I I think we we we agree with uh what
 
00:26:36.269 --> 00:26:36.279 align:start position:0%
the sentiment is we describe it another
 
00:26:38.950 --> 00:26:38.960 align:start position:0%
way but that's that's one of the three
 
00:26:40.510 --> 00:26:40.520 align:start position:0%
elements of this bill that's the key
 
00:26:43.549 --> 00:26:43.559 align:start position:0%
element right then that's probably uh
 
00:26:45.909 --> 00:26:45.919 align:start position:0%
the most significant one for for
 
00:26:48.310 --> 00:26:48.320 align:start position:0%
comparisons all right everybody all
 
00:26:51.070 --> 00:26:51.080 align:start position:0%
clear on that so 3 half% of The Med
 
00:26:54.029 --> 00:26:54.039 align:start position:0%
Medicare and Medicare Services exactly
 
00:26:55.669 --> 00:26:55.679 align:start position:0%
right published rates okay they're
 
00:26:55.679 --> 00:26:56.750 align:start position:0%
right published rates okay they're
published

00:26:56.750 --> 00:26:56.760 align:start position:0%
published
 
00:27:01.590 --> 00:27:01.600 align:start position:0%
rates okay great easy enough and last
 
00:27:03.510 --> 00:27:03.520 align:start position:0%
but not least oh I I'll just say the
 
00:27:05.230 --> 00:27:05.240 align:start position:0%
other thing that's different from the
 
00:27:07.470 --> 00:27:07.480 align:start position:0%
previous bill is that is the prohibition
 
00:27:08.710 --> 00:27:08.720 align:start position:0%
on Balan
 
00:27:08.720 --> 00:27:10.870 align:start position:0%
on Balan
billing

00:27:10.870 --> 00:27:10.880 align:start position:0%
billing
 
00:27:13.590 --> 00:27:13.600 align:start position:0%
right you didn't have B prohibition on
 
00:27:18.710 --> 00:27:18.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:20.789 --> 00:27:20.799 align:start position:0%
yours I don't
 
00:27:24.110 --> 00:27:24.120 align:start position:0%
know okay so his intent is that he
 
00:27:26.710 --> 00:27:26.720 align:start position:0%
didn't need to have that repeal I have
 
00:27:28.950 --> 00:27:28.960 align:start position:0%
that requirement because that the
 
00:27:30.190 --> 00:27:30.200 align:start position:0%
ambulance company is going to get its
 
00:27:31.750 --> 00:27:31.760 align:start position:0%
full amount makes
 
00:27:35.190 --> 00:27:35.200 align:start position:0%
sense fair enough so so basically if if
 
00:27:37.070 --> 00:27:37.080 align:start position:0%
they pay half% then there's no balance
 
00:27:38.990 --> 00:27:39.000 align:start position:0%
billing to the patient but there's no
 
00:27:41.230 --> 00:27:41.240 align:start position:0%
need for balance billing in 185 because
 
00:27:43.909 --> 00:27:43.919 align:start position:0%
the insurer would have to pay the entire
 
00:27:48.110 --> 00:27:48.120 align:start position:0%
bill so there's no balance for in in in
 
00:27:51.909 --> 00:27:51.919 align:start position:0%
uh that's true of 185 that's in
 
00:27:56.470 --> 00:27:56.480 align:start position:0%
185 and and in but in in
 
00:28:00.430 --> 00:28:00.440 align:start position:0%
725 uh they they did uh they did the
 
00:28:03.190 --> 00:28:03.200 align:start position:0%
high number the high percentage 325 but
 
00:28:05.470 --> 00:28:05.480 align:start position:0%
said no they'll there's no balance
 
00:28:07.830 --> 00:28:07.840 align:start position:0%
Billing at that
 
00:28:07.840 --> 00:28:11.950 align:start position:0%
Billing at that
point

00:28:11.950 --> 00:28:11.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:14.990 --> 00:28:15.000 align:start position:0%
no and as uh representative PR has
 
00:28:17.509 --> 00:28:17.519 align:start position:0%
pointed out in the past that 325 still
 
00:28:20.590 --> 00:28:20.600 align:start position:0%
won't make still won't get the money
 
00:28:26.070 --> 00:28:26.080 align:start position:0%
that they need okay so now we come to
 
00:28:29.350 --> 00:28:29.360 align:start position:0%
316 that another one
 
00:28:33.669 --> 00:28:33.679 align:start position:0%
okay so 316 and yes I am the sponsor but
 
00:28:37.149 --> 00:28:37.159 align:start position:0%
so I can uh talk about what what's in
 
00:28:38.389 --> 00:28:38.399 align:start position:0%
this bill and what the intent of the
 
00:28:38.399 --> 00:28:39.389 align:start position:0%
this bill and what the intent of the
bill

00:28:39.389 --> 00:28:39.399 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:28:41.669 --> 00:28:41.679 align:start position:0%
is in
 
00:28:46.630 --> 00:28:46.640 align:start position:0%
316 um is saying is that
 
00:28:49.950 --> 00:28:49.960 align:start position:0%
well we know that whatever number we
 
00:28:53.350 --> 00:28:53.360 align:start position:0%
pick whether it's well one the bill
 
00:28:54.990 --> 00:28:55.000 align:start position:0%
that's going to pay pay whatever is
 
00:28:56.750 --> 00:28:56.760 align:start position:0%
going to be a very high percentage of
 
00:28:58.669 --> 00:28:58.679 align:start position:0%
Medicare rates
 
00:29:00.710 --> 00:29:00.720 align:start position:0%
and 325 IS
 
00:29:04.630 --> 00:29:04.640 align:start position:0%
is um so I I guess this will be my
 
00:29:08.549 --> 00:29:08.559 align:start position:0%
Mantra is the fundamental problem here
 
00:29:11.710 --> 00:29:11.720 align:start position:0%
is is is stated right there in in the
 
00:29:14.590 --> 00:29:14.600 align:start position:0%
concept of the Medicare Medicaid rates
 
00:29:14.600 --> 00:29:15.430 align:start position:0%
concept of the Medicare Medicaid rates
in

00:29:15.430 --> 00:29:15.440 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:29:15.440 --> 00:29:17.310 align:start position:0%
in
which

00:29:17.310 --> 00:29:17.320 align:start position:0%
which
 
00:29:19.509 --> 00:29:19.519 align:start position:0%
80% of the
 
00:29:21.389 --> 00:29:21.399 align:start position:0%
users of
 
00:29:24.909 --> 00:29:24.919 align:start position:0%
ambulances that's everybody and that's
 
00:29:29.190 --> 00:29:29.200 align:start position:0%
either transfer or emergency calls or
 
00:29:32.070 --> 00:29:32.080 align:start position:0%
80% are Medicare Medicaid
 
00:29:32.080 --> 00:29:33.870 align:start position:0%
80% are Medicare Medicaid
patients

00:29:33.870 --> 00:29:33.880 align:start position:0%
patients
 
00:29:37.870 --> 00:29:37.880 align:start position:0%
80% and yet Medicare Medicaid pays the
 
00:29:39.430 --> 00:29:39.440 align:start position:0%
lowest amount right because we're
 
00:29:43.149 --> 00:29:43.159 align:start position:0%
talking like 325 per of that I mean the
 
00:29:43.159 --> 00:29:44.389 align:start position:0%
talking like 325 per of that I mean the
lowest

00:29:44.389 --> 00:29:44.399 align:start position:0%
lowest
 
00:29:51.430 --> 00:29:51.440 align:start position:0%
rates so the downside of those bills is
 
00:29:59.110 --> 00:29:59.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:02.190 --> 00:30:02.200 align:start position:0%
of the insured who are
 
00:30:05.789 --> 00:30:05.799 align:start position:0%
insured which even of that percentage of
 
00:30:05.799 --> 00:30:06.789 align:start position:0%
insured which even of that percentage of
that

00:30:06.789 --> 00:30:06.799 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:30:09.990 --> 00:30:10.000 align:start position:0%
177% only seven that so let that's for
 
00:30:13.470 --> 00:30:13.480 align:start position:0%
discussion purpos say half of that group
 
00:30:17.110 --> 00:30:17.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:20.190 --> 00:30:20.200 align:start position:0%
ambulance and we're going to ask that
 
00:30:22.070 --> 00:30:22.080 align:start position:0%
group to
 
00:30:25.310 --> 00:30:25.320 align:start position:0%
pay for the fact that Medicare and
 
00:30:28.549 --> 00:30:28.559 align:start position:0%
Medicaid rates are so low
 
00:30:32.110 --> 00:30:32.120 align:start position:0%
we're expecting them to pay it now
 
00:30:34.310 --> 00:30:34.320 align:start position:0%
obviously the current statute the
 
00:30:37.190 --> 00:30:37.200 align:start position:0%
current policy or say the current way we
 
00:30:38.350 --> 00:30:38.360 align:start position:0%
have been doing
 
00:30:41.830 --> 00:30:41.840 align:start position:0%
businesses is that that group of PE that
 
00:30:43.750 --> 00:30:43.760 align:start position:0%
people who are fully insured the
 
00:30:45.549 --> 00:30:45.559 align:start position:0%
insurance companies going to pay what
 
00:30:47.549 --> 00:30:47.559 align:start position:0%
they have
 
00:30:50.750 --> 00:30:50.760 align:start position:0%
their uh guy with the green Shades to
 
00:30:53.190 --> 00:30:53.200 align:start position:0%
come up and came up with it their their
 
00:30:58.789 --> 00:30:58.799 align:start position:0%
compensation rate and um the end result
 
00:31:03.310 --> 00:31:03.320 align:start position:0%
is that an ambulance company has to
 
00:31:03.320 --> 00:31:06.389 align:start position:0%
is that an ambulance company has to
balance

00:31:06.389 --> 00:31:06.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:09.269 --> 00:31:09.279 align:start position:0%
Bill what's missing before you make that
 
00:31:11.750 --> 00:31:11.760 align:start position:0%
statement about balance billing is if
 
00:31:14.629 --> 00:31:14.639 align:start position:0%
there wasn't any balance billing then
 
00:31:18.070 --> 00:31:18.080 align:start position:0%
that rate that differential would have
 
00:31:19.990 --> 00:31:20.000 align:start position:0%
to be paid and let's say with Medicare
 
00:31:22.870 --> 00:31:22.880 align:start position:0%
Medicaid that differential is paid by
 
00:31:24.870 --> 00:31:24.880 align:start position:0%
the city in
 
00:31:28.710 --> 00:31:28.720 align:start position:0%
towns the property taxpayers are paying
 
00:31:30.950 --> 00:31:30.960 align:start position:0%
that can you repeat the last part last
 
00:31:33.830 --> 00:31:33.840 align:start position:0%
sentence the property tax if they that
 
00:31:38.070 --> 00:31:38.080 align:start position:0%
in terms of the current system now which
 
00:31:40.870 --> 00:31:40.880 align:start position:0%
is that 177% yeah or let's say the
 
00:31:43.310 --> 00:31:43.320 align:start position:0%
Medicare pay you know which is very low
 
00:31:47.230 --> 00:31:47.240 align:start position:0%
percentage that all that loss that the
 
00:31:49.549 --> 00:31:49.559 align:start position:0%
that the money that's not getting
 
00:31:51.470 --> 00:31:51.480 align:start position:0%
paid right
 
00:31:53.830 --> 00:31:53.840 align:start position:0%
now the
 
00:31:57.389 --> 00:31:57.399 align:start position:0%
obligation is the cities and town
 
00:31:57.399 --> 00:31:58.549 align:start position:0%
obligation is the cities and town
property

00:31:58.549 --> 00:31:58.559 align:start position:0%
property
 
00:32:00.549 --> 00:32:00.559 align:start position:0%
taxpayer okay they're the ones who are
 
00:32:00.559 --> 00:32:01.470 align:start position:0%
taxpayer okay they're the ones who are
paying

00:32:01.470 --> 00:32:01.480 align:start position:0%
paying
 
00:32:06.350 --> 00:32:06.360 align:start position:0%
it okay so over the years the is to say
 
00:32:08.669 --> 00:32:08.679 align:start position:0%
the city and towns more too crazy
 
00:32:11.350 --> 00:32:11.360 align:start position:0%
about paying all that
 
00:32:17.269 --> 00:32:17.279 align:start position:0%
service that the pattern in practice has
 
00:32:20.350 --> 00:32:20.360 align:start position:0%
been to balance
 
00:32:24.230 --> 00:32:24.240 align:start position:0%
Bill to they would the fire departments
 
00:32:25.750 --> 00:32:25.760 align:start position:0%
the amulance companies wherever way
 
00:32:28.389 --> 00:32:28.399 align:start position:0%
they're organized would then send a bill
 
00:32:31.070 --> 00:32:31.080 align:start position:0%
to the patient and
 
00:32:33.470 --> 00:32:33.480 align:start position:0%
said whatever your circumstance is
 
00:32:35.149 --> 00:32:35.159 align:start position:0%
whether you're a Medicare Medicaid or
 
00:32:36.909 --> 00:32:36.919 align:start position:0%
whether you're a private insurance this
 
00:32:40.029 --> 00:32:40.039 align:start position:0%
is how much we got from
 
00:32:42.310 --> 00:32:42.320 align:start position:0%
them this is our
 
00:32:44.990 --> 00:32:45.000 align:start position:0%
bill they represent approv this is what
 
00:32:48.710 --> 00:32:48.720 align:start position:0%
our bill is that difference please send
 
00:32:50.350 --> 00:32:50.360 align:start position:0%
us the
 
00:32:52.549 --> 00:32:52.559 align:start position:0%
check and so therefore for the city in
 
00:32:52.559 --> 00:32:55.110 align:start position:0%
check and so therefore for the city in
town

00:32:55.110 --> 00:32:55.120 align:start position:0%
town
 
00:32:58.190 --> 00:32:58.200 align:start position:0%
taxpayers wouldn't have to pay for it
 
00:33:00.830 --> 00:33:00.840 align:start position:0%
but if they don't pay for it the city
 
00:33:02.549 --> 00:33:02.559 align:start position:0%
and town taxpayer has to make up the
 
00:33:03.789 --> 00:33:03.799 align:start position:0%
differ aren we talking about these
 
00:33:06.710 --> 00:33:06.720 align:start position:0%
things just because historically that
 
00:33:10.629 --> 00:33:10.639 align:start position:0%
bill being sent to the person is not
 
00:33:12.990 --> 00:33:13.000 align:start position:0%
paid most of the time uh we're saying
 
00:33:15.310 --> 00:33:15.320 align:start position:0%
we've heard we've heard anywhere from 60
 
00:33:18.629 --> 00:33:18.639 align:start position:0%
to 80% not paid not paid so only 20%
 
00:33:18.639 --> 00:33:19.470 align:start position:0%
to 80% not paid not paid so only 20%
gets

00:33:19.470 --> 00:33:19.480 align:start position:0%
gets
 
00:33:24.389 --> 00:33:24.399 align:start position:0%
paid 60 to 80% gets paid excuse me 68%
 
00:33:28.990 --> 00:33:29.000 align:start position:0%
gets paid 20 to 40% does not get paid
 
00:33:30.950 --> 00:33:30.960 align:start position:0%
so 60 80% gets paid is pretty good
 
00:33:34.269 --> 00:33:34.279 align:start position:0%
amount of getting paid I know that some
 
00:33:36.430 --> 00:33:36.440 align:start position:0%
people might not agree with that what is
 
00:33:37.669 --> 00:33:37.679 align:start position:0%
because I thought that's the problem
 
00:33:39.269 --> 00:33:39.279 align:start position:0%
that problem they talking stay what do
 
00:33:41.029 --> 00:33:41.039 align:start position:0%
you think if they get paid what what
 
00:33:45.190 --> 00:33:45.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:49.590 --> 00:33:49.600 align:start position:0%
Val 20 or 30% actually gets basically 20
 
00:33:51.310 --> 00:33:51.320 align:start position:0%
30 they're saying it's that low of a
 
00:33:53.990 --> 00:33:54.000 align:start position:0%
percentage gets paid and so therefore
 
00:33:56.350 --> 00:33:56.360 align:start position:0%
the remaining balance to make the fire
 
00:33:58.149 --> 00:33:58.159 align:start position:0%
department or make the ambulance service
 
00:34:01.950 --> 00:34:01.960 align:start position:0%
get what they need they will they will
 
00:34:03.710 --> 00:34:03.720 align:start position:0%
then back Bill if you want to call it
 
00:34:06.470 --> 00:34:06.480 align:start position:0%
that they will then say to the city and
 
00:34:09.149 --> 00:34:09.159 align:start position:0%
town for us to continue our operation
 
00:34:12.470 --> 00:34:12.480 align:start position:0%
our services you need to we need this x
 
00:34:15.470 --> 00:34:15.480 align:start position:0%
amount of money to balance our
 
00:34:18.510 --> 00:34:18.520 align:start position:0%
Books Okay representative Gibbs thank
 
00:34:19.510 --> 00:34:19.520 align:start position:0%
you Mr
 
00:34:22.270 --> 00:34:22.280 align:start position:0%
chair um when I went over these bills
 
00:34:25.470 --> 00:34:25.480 align:start position:0%
last night and based on the extensive
 
00:34:27.109 --> 00:34:27.119 align:start position:0%
information that we got during the
 
00:34:30.430 --> 00:34:30.440 align:start position:0%
public hearing ing um it occurred to me
 
00:34:32.030 --> 00:34:32.040 align:start position:0%
that there are three things that are
 
00:34:35.909 --> 00:34:35.919 align:start position:0%
important in all of these bills um one
 
00:34:38.069 --> 00:34:38.079 align:start position:0%
is that the insurance company pay the
 
00:34:40.430 --> 00:34:40.440 align:start position:0%
provider directly which I believe all
 
00:34:45.030 --> 00:34:45.040 align:start position:0%
three bills um are provide um the second
 
00:34:48.349 --> 00:34:48.359 align:start position:0%
is that there not be balance billing um
 
00:34:50.550 --> 00:34:50.560 align:start position:0%
because of the problem that that causes
 
00:34:53.909 --> 00:34:53.919 align:start position:0%
to the patents um and two of the bills
 
00:34:56.829 --> 00:34:56.839 align:start position:0%
provide that it doesn't apply in 185
 
00:34:58.109 --> 00:34:58.119 align:start position:0%
because they're the bill from the
 
00:34:59.990 --> 00:35:00.000 align:start position:0%
provider to the insurance company is the
 
00:35:02.750 --> 00:35:02.760 align:start position:0%
entire bill so there's no balance left
 
00:35:05.030 --> 00:35:05.040 align:start position:0%
and then the third is the amount of
 
00:35:07.270 --> 00:35:07.280 align:start position:0%
money that we're going to require the
 
00:35:11.829 --> 00:35:11.839 align:start position:0%
insurance company to pay the provider um
 
00:35:14.349 --> 00:35:14.359 align:start position:0%
and that that amount uh leaves the
 
00:35:17.430 --> 00:35:17.440 align:start position:0%
provider in a situation where they at
 
00:35:19.510 --> 00:35:19.520 align:start position:0%
least have a Fighting Chance of not
 
00:35:21.829 --> 00:35:21.839 align:start position:0%
going out of business and we have to
 
00:35:24.470 --> 00:35:24.480 align:start position:0%
approach this with the knowledge that we
 
00:35:26.750 --> 00:35:26.760 align:start position:0%
can't there's nothing we can do about
 
00:35:29.550 --> 00:35:29.560 align:start position:0%
the Medicare or Medicaid rates because
 
00:35:31.990 --> 00:35:32.000 align:start position:0%
we can't control the federal government
 
00:35:34.910 --> 00:35:34.920 align:start position:0%
and there's basically nothing we can do
 
00:35:37.109 --> 00:35:37.119 align:start position:0%
about the amount of money that the
 
00:35:39.310 --> 00:35:39.320 align:start position:0%
municipalities have because we don't
 
00:35:42.670 --> 00:35:42.680 align:start position:0%
control their property tax rates so what
 
00:35:44.910 --> 00:35:44.920 align:start position:0%
we can deal with is the rates that we're
 
00:35:49.109 --> 00:35:49.119 align:start position:0%
going to um uh set for the insurance
 
00:35:50.910 --> 00:35:50.920 align:start position:0%
company I realize this is only going to
 
00:35:55.349 --> 00:35:55.359 align:start position:0%
be for a proportion of the policies but
 
00:35:57.349 --> 00:35:57.359 align:start position:0%
again that's all we can deal with that's
 
00:35:59.710 --> 00:35:59.720 align:start position:0%
all we we have power over and the
 
00:36:03.470 --> 00:36:03.480 align:start position:0%
testimony from the providers was that
 
00:36:07.670 --> 00:36:07.680 align:start position:0%
the only um uh setting at which they
 
00:36:09.990 --> 00:36:10.000 align:start position:0%
would have a Fighting Chance of not
 
00:36:12.190 --> 00:36:12.200 align:start position:0%
going out of business and I recognize
 
00:36:13.670 --> 00:36:13.680 align:start position:0%
that this is not going to solve all
 
00:36:15.829 --> 00:36:15.839 align:start position:0%
their problems but which would give them
 
00:36:17.710 --> 00:36:17.720 align:start position:0%
a Fighting Chance of not going out of
 
00:36:21.230 --> 00:36:21.240 align:start position:0%
business um and I recognize that some of
 
00:36:22.790 --> 00:36:22.800 align:start position:0%
my colleagues are going to strongly
 
00:36:25.510 --> 00:36:25.520 align:start position:0%
disagree with this but from what they
 
00:36:29.390 --> 00:36:29.400 align:start position:0%
said that it was it's 325 per of
 
00:36:32.270 --> 00:36:32.280 align:start position:0%
Medicare as in House Bill
 
00:36:35.109 --> 00:36:35.119 align:start position:0%
725 um and that seems to me the most
 
00:36:36.750 --> 00:36:36.760 align:start position:0%
logical thing to
 
00:36:39.870 --> 00:36:39.880 align:start position:0%
do okay representative
 
00:36:44.190 --> 00:36:44.200 align:start position:0%
miles thank you Mr chairman um I do
 
00:36:47.710 --> 00:36:47.720 align:start position:0%
agree with you uh representative Gibbs
 
00:36:49.790 --> 00:36:49.800 align:start position:0%
um my question
 
00:36:54.470 --> 00:36:54.480 align:start position:0%
is isn't it better to receive for the
 
00:36:54.480 --> 00:36:56.309 align:start position:0%
is isn't it better to receive for the
town

00:36:56.309 --> 00:36:56.319 align:start position:0%
town
 
00:36:58.030 --> 00:36:58.040 align:start position:0%
325 of
 
00:37:01.510 --> 00:37:01.520 align:start position:0%
Medicare than
 
00:37:05.829 --> 00:37:05.839 align:start position:0%
0% of from a balanced bill that most
 
00:37:08.309 --> 00:37:08.319 align:start position:0%
people just really can't cough up the
 
00:37:13.829 --> 00:37:13.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:16.990 --> 00:37:17.000 align:start position:0%
pay that's my question I think that's
 
00:37:18.589 --> 00:37:18.599 align:start position:0%
why we're talking about that we should
 
00:37:22.950 --> 00:37:22.960 align:start position:0%
uh look towards paying 3 25% is because
 
00:37:24.390 --> 00:37:24.400 align:start position:0%
balance building definitely looks like
 
00:37:26.510 --> 00:37:26.520 align:start position:0%
balance building is not working I mean I
 
00:37:27.790 --> 00:37:27.800 align:start position:0%
don't know where you got the information
 
00:37:30.309 --> 00:37:30.319 align:start position:0%
that 60 to 80% are getting paid I hear
 
00:37:32.390 --> 00:37:32.400 align:start position:0%
from them is 20% getting paid I mean
 
00:37:34.190 --> 00:37:34.200 align:start position:0%
there is no I don't know whether where
 
00:37:37.430 --> 00:37:37.440 align:start position:0%
the data or who is where did the at the
 
00:37:39.630 --> 00:37:39.640 align:start position:0%
end of the day if if let's say there
 
00:37:41.950 --> 00:37:41.960 align:start position:0%
wasn't any balance billing let's say if
 
00:37:45.430 --> 00:37:45.440 align:start position:0%
we just said no balance billing then
 
00:37:49.670 --> 00:37:49.680 align:start position:0%
whatever was short would be paid by the
 
00:37:49.680 --> 00:37:51.470 align:start position:0%
whatever was short would be paid by the
property

00:37:51.470 --> 00:37:51.480 align:start position:0%
property
 
00:37:54.510 --> 00:37:54.520 align:start position:0%
taxpayers who have that Ambulance
 
00:37:57.950 --> 00:37:57.960 align:start position:0%
Company in their Town yeah ly balance
 
00:38:00.030 --> 00:38:00.040 align:start position:0%
building is not working otherwise uh no
 
00:38:03.470 --> 00:38:03.480 align:start position:0%
balance building will does work that 20%
 
00:38:05.790 --> 00:38:05.800 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry that's just not that that may
 
00:38:09.030 --> 00:38:09.040 align:start position:0%
be their perspective on it okay but I'm
 
00:38:11.990 --> 00:38:12.000 align:start position:0%
just telling you that I I and and I
 
00:38:14.230 --> 00:38:14.240 align:start position:0%
guess we can ask people around the room
 
00:38:16.030 --> 00:38:16.040 align:start position:0%
and how many people have ever had to pay
 
00:38:18.390 --> 00:38:18.400 align:start position:0%
the balance Bill I know I've done it for
 
00:38:21.230 --> 00:38:21.240 align:start position:0%
my for my mother and I paid the whole
 
00:38:24.910 --> 00:38:24.920 align:start position:0%
per okay so I think most people are fine
 
00:38:27.069 --> 00:38:27.079 align:start position:0%
upstanding citizens and they're and I
 
00:38:29.710 --> 00:38:29.720 align:start position:0%
the % makes no sense to me but if there
 
00:38:32.870 --> 00:38:32.880 align:start position:0%
is that 20% that means that all those
 
00:38:36.670 --> 00:38:36.680 align:start position:0%
people in that Community were fine with
 
00:38:39.710 --> 00:38:39.720 align:start position:0%
letting the city or town that they live
 
00:38:42.430 --> 00:38:42.440 align:start position:0%
in make up the difference yeah so and
 
00:38:44.470 --> 00:38:44.480 align:start position:0%
now I have more hard time understanding
 
00:38:46.990 --> 00:38:47.000 align:start position:0%
if balance billing is working and if if
 
00:38:49.589 --> 00:38:49.599 align:start position:0%
it's not being if it if it didn't work
 
00:38:51.270 --> 00:38:51.280 align:start position:0%
to the extent then City and town is
 
00:38:53.790 --> 00:38:53.800 align:start position:0%
picking the tab then why the ambulance
 
00:38:56.829 --> 00:38:56.839 align:start position:0%
companies right now here they are saying
 
00:38:58.270 --> 00:38:58.280 align:start position:0%
the story that that they are on the
 
00:38:59.510 --> 00:38:59.520 align:start position:0%
verge of Extinction and they can't
 
00:39:01.910 --> 00:39:01.920 align:start position:0%
operate properly if nothing nothing done
 
00:39:03.710 --> 00:39:03.720 align:start position:0%
I have an opinion about that that part
 
00:39:05.510 --> 00:39:05.520 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm having hard time understand well
 
00:39:07.230 --> 00:39:07.240 align:start position:0%
let me tell you my opinion isn't the
 
00:39:09.270 --> 00:39:09.280 align:start position:0%
balance spilling also a serious problem
 
00:39:11.510 --> 00:39:11.520 align:start position:0%
for the patients we have to also keep
 
00:39:14.230 --> 00:39:14.240 align:start position:0%
that in mind as well as the fact that
 
00:39:16.150 --> 00:39:16.160 align:start position:0%
the ambulance companies are never
 
00:39:18.630 --> 00:39:18.640 align:start position:0%
getting the full amount of what of of
 
00:39:21.270 --> 00:39:21.280 align:start position:0%
what they need to build that's the point
 
00:39:23.109 --> 00:39:23.119 align:start position:0%
that I want to
 
00:39:26.349 --> 00:39:26.359 align:start position:0%
make I have been on this
 
00:39:29.630 --> 00:39:29.640 align:start position:0%
committee for over 30
 
00:39:33.390 --> 00:39:33.400 align:start position:0%
years and I have heard this claim that
 
00:39:35.190 --> 00:39:35.200 align:start position:0%
they are going on a
 
00:39:38.870 --> 00:39:38.880 align:start position:0%
business all 30
 
00:39:41.349 --> 00:39:41.359 align:start position:0%
years so why haven't they gone out of
 
00:39:43.950 --> 00:39:43.960 align:start position:0%
business well that's part I was I'm
 
00:39:46.750 --> 00:39:46.760 align:start position:0%
going to tell you the simple answer yeah
 
00:39:49.670 --> 00:39:49.680 align:start position:0%
because they have been able to get the
 
00:39:53.910 --> 00:39:53.920 align:start position:0%
cities in towns to pay for them and I am
 
00:39:56.510 --> 00:39:56.520 align:start position:0%
asking you to think there is no
 
00:39:56.520 --> 00:39:57.910 align:start position:0%
asking you to think there is no
difference

00:39:57.910 --> 00:39:57.920 align:start position:0%
difference
 
00:39:59.150 --> 00:39:59.160 align:start position:0%
between an
 
00:40:02.910 --> 00:40:02.920 align:start position:0%
ambulance and a fire Tru or an AM or a
 
00:40:06.349 --> 00:40:06.359 align:start position:0%
police car in all three cases the town
 
00:40:09.150 --> 00:40:09.160 align:start position:0%
is providing a service to the community
 
00:40:12.190 --> 00:40:12.200 align:start position:0%
put do a vital
 
00:40:15.069 --> 00:40:15.079 align:start position:0%
service okay but that at the end of the
 
00:40:17.589 --> 00:40:17.599 align:start position:0%
day if they're going to go out of bank
 
00:40:18.670 --> 00:40:18.680 align:start position:0%
they're going to go bankrupt right
 
00:40:20.950 --> 00:40:20.960 align:start position:0%
they're going to go out of
 
00:40:23.790 --> 00:40:23.800 align:start position:0%
business okay is because the city and
 
00:40:27.510 --> 00:40:27.520 align:start position:0%
town decided not to pay them anymore
 
00:40:30.069 --> 00:40:30.079 align:start position:0%
that's who would pull the plug because
 
00:40:31.589 --> 00:40:31.599 align:start position:0%
they are our
 
00:40:34.030 --> 00:40:34.040 align:start position:0%
Municipal that's who they are yeah and
 
00:40:35.870 --> 00:40:35.880 align:start position:0%
they have to pay anyway because there
 
00:40:37.550 --> 00:40:37.560 align:start position:0%
are plenty of private companies out
 
00:40:39.230 --> 00:40:39.240 align:start position:0%
there but those private companies were
 
00:40:40.750 --> 00:40:40.760 align:start position:0%
only in the big
 
00:40:44.950 --> 00:40:44.960 align:start position:0%
cities okay as a matter of fact in my
 
00:40:48.309 --> 00:40:48.319 align:start position:0%
County we had a private company and it
 
00:40:51.109 --> 00:40:51.119 align:start position:0%
was in huge financial
 
00:40:54.589 --> 00:40:54.599 align:start position:0%
distress and yes as sitting as a member
 
00:40:56.630 --> 00:40:56.640 align:start position:0%
of the executive committee in my County
 
00:40:59.230 --> 00:40:59.240 align:start position:0%
we got the look at the books and we know
 
00:41:01.349 --> 00:41:01.359 align:start position:0%
exactly why he was losing a lot of
 
00:41:04.430 --> 00:41:04.440 align:start position:0%
money because they weren't charging the
 
00:41:07.630 --> 00:41:07.640 align:start position:0%
cities and towns enough money whatever
 
00:41:10.349 --> 00:41:10.359 align:start position:0%
the balance billing was and yes it was
 
00:41:14.270 --> 00:41:14.280 align:start position:0%
65% something like that okay the issue
 
00:41:18.990 --> 00:41:19.000 align:start position:0%
is here is that is it
 
00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:20.910 align:start position:0%
is here is that is it
fair

00:41:20.910 --> 00:41:20.920 align:start position:0%
fair
 
00:41:20.920 --> 00:41:22.950 align:start position:0%
fair
that

00:41:22.950 --> 00:41:22.960 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:41:26.550 --> 00:41:26.560 align:start position:0%
177% of the popul State's population is
 
00:41:28.190 --> 00:41:28.200 align:start position:0%
going to fund
 
00:41:30.550 --> 00:41:30.560 align:start position:0%
the health the to pay for these
 
00:41:32.750 --> 00:41:32.760 align:start position:0%
ambulances for the
 
00:41:35.630 --> 00:41:35.640 align:start position:0%
remaining 83% of the
 
00:41:38.829 --> 00:41:38.839 align:start position:0%
state is that fair but is isn't it the
 
00:41:40.589 --> 00:41:40.599 align:start position:0%
insurance company and I realize that
 
00:41:42.430 --> 00:41:42.440 align:start position:0%
this will result in somewhat higher
 
00:41:44.710 --> 00:41:44.720 align:start position:0%
premiums but what I understood what I
 
00:41:45.990 --> 00:41:46.000 align:start position:0%
understood from the hearing is that it
 
00:41:48.270 --> 00:41:48.280 align:start position:0%
would be a few dollars for each person
 
00:41:50.670 --> 00:41:50.680 align:start position:0%
not a user anybody will spend what they
 
00:41:53.710 --> 00:41:53.720 align:start position:0%
want but it's like $7 per person you
 
00:41:56.470 --> 00:41:56.480 align:start position:0%
know per month you know add that number
 
00:41:58.990 --> 00:41:59.000 align:start position:0%
up it's it's it it would be it would be
 
00:42:01.910 --> 00:42:01.920 align:start position:0%
the largest mandate we've ever passed
 
00:42:04.309 --> 00:42:04.319 align:start position:0%
out of this committee if we pass that
 
00:42:06.990 --> 00:42:07.000 align:start position:0%
number be better to do that rather than
 
00:42:10.309 --> 00:42:10.319 align:start position:0%
put it on the property taxpayers if we
 
00:42:13.190 --> 00:42:13.200 align:start position:0%
if we lose one person on the roles of
 
00:42:15.349 --> 00:42:15.359 align:start position:0%
the insurance because they can't afford
 
00:42:18.069 --> 00:42:18.079 align:start position:0%
their premiums and it's $7 per policy
 
00:42:20.549 --> 00:42:20.559 align:start position:0%
per person in the family so if it's a
 
00:42:23.069 --> 00:42:23.079 align:start position:0%
family of four it's four time 7 if we
 
00:42:24.990 --> 00:42:25.000 align:start position:0%
lose those people it's going to cost us
 
00:42:27.190 --> 00:42:27.200 align:start position:0%
a whole heck of a lot more money so
 
00:42:28.870 --> 00:42:28.880 align:start position:0%
don't be so quick to give away our
 
00:42:31.349 --> 00:42:31.359 align:start position:0%
insurance premiums and and knock people
 
00:42:33.430 --> 00:42:33.440 align:start position:0%
off the rolls okay I don't think I'm
 
00:42:34.990 --> 00:42:35.000 align:start position:0%
giving away anything I'm not finished
 
00:42:38.230 --> 00:42:38.240 align:start position:0%
yet okay sorry so what happened is this
 
00:42:40.230 --> 00:42:40.240 align:start position:0%
issue has been around
 
00:42:43.589 --> 00:42:43.599 align:start position:0%
forever okay and we've nipped in tucked
 
00:42:45.910 --> 00:42:45.920 align:start position:0%
in we were making sure the insurance
 
00:42:48.150 --> 00:42:48.160 align:start position:0%
check this past year we made sure the
 
00:42:50.430 --> 00:42:50.440 align:start position:0%
insurance company's check went directly
 
00:42:52.470 --> 00:42:52.480 align:start position:0%
to the ambulance and not to the consumer
 
00:42:55.069 --> 00:42:55.079 align:start position:0%
because the consumer would just cash the
 
00:42:57.349 --> 00:42:57.359 align:start position:0%
check and and you know like can use the
 
00:43:01.589 --> 00:43:01.599 align:start position:0%
words of Ken wer woohoo okay
 
00:43:07.150 --> 00:43:07.160 align:start position:0%
so the issue here is that we all
 
00:43:10.750 --> 00:43:10.760 align:start position:0%
agree insurance companies can pay
 
00:43:14.150 --> 00:43:14.160 align:start position:0%
more that is the premise yes and so
 
00:43:17.230 --> 00:43:17.240 align:start position:0%
therefore what we said is the ask the
 
00:43:17.240 --> 00:43:18.270 align:start position:0%
therefore what we said is the ask the
insurance

00:43:18.270 --> 00:43:18.280 align:start position:0%
insurance
 
00:43:21.230 --> 00:43:21.240 align:start position:0%
department to have to hire an outside
 
00:43:23.710 --> 00:43:23.720 align:start position:0%
expert who would collect information
 
00:43:25.750 --> 00:43:25.760 align:start position:0%
from all these people you see in this
 
00:43:29.670 --> 00:43:29.680 align:start position:0%
room here yeah they all send
 
00:43:34.589 --> 00:43:34.599 align:start position:0%
data and come back with a percentage
 
00:43:36.750 --> 00:43:36.760 align:start position:0%
that is appropriate and not just picked
 
00:43:39.670 --> 00:43:39.680 align:start position:0%
out of the air like 325 yeah I mean I
 
00:43:44.150 --> 00:43:44.160 align:start position:0%
think and that's what 316 does but then
 
00:43:48.349 --> 00:43:48.359 align:start position:0%
why does Maine um have a 400% level
 
00:43:49.670 --> 00:43:49.680 align:start position:0%
again they pulled the number out of the
 
00:43:52.589 --> 00:43:52.599 align:start position:0%
air but there is no there is no
 
00:43:56.309 --> 00:43:56.319 align:start position:0%
Financial basis for the 325 or the 400
 
00:43:57.790 --> 00:43:57.800 align:start position:0%
any of those numbers
 
00:44:00.190 --> 00:44:00.200 align:start position:0%
they they just they just winged it so I
 
00:44:01.549 --> 00:44:01.559 align:start position:0%
agree it should be a negotiated amount
 
00:44:02.990 --> 00:44:03.000 align:start position:0%
between the insurance company and the
 
00:44:05.190 --> 00:44:05.200 align:start position:0%
ambulance service we should be just
 
00:44:08.230 --> 00:44:08.240 align:start position:0%
mandating some percent well no the
 
00:44:11.910 --> 00:44:11.920 align:start position:0%
percent but but we're uh we're being
 
00:44:14.750 --> 00:44:14.760 align:start position:0%
thoughtful about this and now we'll look
 
00:44:17.270 --> 00:44:17.280 align:start position:0%
at this percentage every two
 
00:44:19.430 --> 00:44:19.440 align:start position:0%
years you know we're going to take the
 
00:44:21.230 --> 00:44:21.240 align:start position:0%
stat statistical analysis we're going to
 
00:44:23.470 --> 00:44:23.480 align:start position:0%
bring it in and we're going to be
 
00:44:26.349 --> 00:44:26.359 align:start position:0%
thoughtful about what that increase so
 
00:44:28.829 --> 00:44:28.839 align:start position:0%
you know maybe you maybe 204 which is
 
00:44:30.870 --> 00:44:30.880 align:start position:0%
what I believe we're at you know it's
 
00:44:33.309 --> 00:44:33.319 align:start position:0%
not right 204 am I get the right number
 
00:44:37.870 --> 00:44:37.880 align:start position:0%
I believe 202 202 excuse me okay 202 is
 
00:44:40.109 --> 00:44:40.119 align:start position:0%
what we have you know if we were that
 
00:44:43.190 --> 00:44:43.200 align:start position:0%
the way at the current analysis who
 
00:44:44.430 --> 00:44:44.440 align:start position:0%
knows what it'll be from two years from
 
00:44:46.230 --> 00:44:46.240 align:start position:0%
now but given inflation I'm sure it'll
 
00:44:49.230 --> 00:44:49.240 align:start position:0%
be higher okay but we're saying is
 
00:44:52.230 --> 00:44:52.240 align:start position:0%
that's just not just take a number
 
00:44:53.750 --> 00:44:53.760 align:start position:0%
because we we feel sorry for the
 
00:44:55.549 --> 00:44:55.559 align:start position:0%
ambulance companies and we feel sorry
 
00:44:57.390 --> 00:44:57.400 align:start position:0%
for the fire departments and the town in
 
00:45:00.349 --> 00:45:00.359 align:start position:0%
which have these Services let's just be
 
00:45:02.829 --> 00:45:02.839 align:start position:0%
rational about it and be thoughtful
 
00:45:05.710 --> 00:45:05.720 align:start position:0%
about it and come up with a reasonable
 
00:45:08.790 --> 00:45:08.800 align:start position:0%
number a reasonable percentage that we
 
00:45:12.069 --> 00:45:12.079 align:start position:0%
know we build into it that it can
 
00:45:16.030 --> 00:45:16.040 align:start position:0%
grow knowing full well that the real
 
00:45:18.309 --> 00:45:18.319 align:start position:0%
we're not really solving the whole
 
00:45:22.630 --> 00:45:22.640 align:start position:0%
problem but we run a chance and I can't
 
00:45:25.030 --> 00:45:25.040 align:start position:0%
there's no promises here but we run a
 
00:45:28.750 --> 00:45:28.760 align:start position:0%
chance that once we pass this mandate we
 
00:45:33.630 --> 00:45:33.640 align:start position:0%
can go back to CMS and ask them to
 
00:45:37.470 --> 00:45:37.480 align:start position:0%
up the Medicare reimbursement
 
00:45:40.309 --> 00:45:40.319 align:start position:0%
rate that is the hope we're not
 
00:45:42.630 --> 00:45:42.640 align:start position:0%
guaranteeing it we know that there's a
 
00:45:44.430 --> 00:45:44.440 align:start position:0%
wer Pro there are some processes in
 
00:45:47.549 --> 00:45:47.559 align:start position:0%
which we can make a case that the number
 
00:45:50.589 --> 00:45:50.599 align:start position:0%
should be a higher number but at least
 
00:45:52.589 --> 00:45:52.599 align:start position:0%
this legislature is going to do
 
00:45:54.870 --> 00:45:54.880 align:start position:0%
something because what I'm telling you
 
00:45:58.549 --> 00:45:58.559 align:start position:0%
is that even if you were to take this
 
00:46:00.790 --> 00:46:00.800 align:start position:0%
325 we just heard from one of the
 
00:46:03.349 --> 00:46:03.359 align:start position:0%
sponsors that ain't that won't cover the
 
00:46:06.470 --> 00:46:06.480 align:start position:0%
problem so they'll be back and they'll
 
00:46:09.150 --> 00:46:09.160 align:start position:0%
be back again and again and again coming
 
00:46:11.589 --> 00:46:11.599 align:start position:0%
back with just give us whatever we
 
00:46:15.710 --> 00:46:15.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:20.230 --> 00:46:20.240 align:start position:0%
and we all know the ultimate goal is
 
00:46:22.950 --> 00:46:22.960 align:start position:0%
really to get rid of balance billing we
 
00:46:24.069 --> 00:46:24.079 align:start position:0%
really want to get rid of balance
 
00:46:27.589 --> 00:46:27.599 align:start position:0%
billing so so the question is how much
 
00:46:29.589 --> 00:46:29.599 align:start position:0%
do that number should be what's the
 
00:46:32.150 --> 00:46:32.160 align:start position:0%
rational number that make gets rid of
 
00:46:34.750 --> 00:46:34.760 align:start position:0%
the balance billing which takes care of
 
00:46:37.589 --> 00:46:37.599 align:start position:0%
the taxpayer too okay the people who are
 
00:46:41.349 --> 00:46:41.359 align:start position:0%
doing it okay but then spreads that
 
00:46:45.109 --> 00:46:45.119 align:start position:0%
balance billing fee over that Community
 
00:46:47.470 --> 00:46:47.480 align:start position:0%
the the taxpayer in that committee will
 
00:46:49.430 --> 00:46:49.440 align:start position:0%
make up that difference so so I have two
 
00:46:51.430 --> 00:46:51.440 align:start position:0%
two questions and comment actually one
 
00:46:53.790 --> 00:46:53.800 align:start position:0%
is that so are you saying that uh you
 
00:46:57.230 --> 00:46:57.240 align:start position:0%
are in favor of uh putting a number like
 
00:46:59.710 --> 00:46:59.720 align:start position:0%
3 25% or are you saying that you are in
 
00:47:02.710 --> 00:47:02.720 align:start position:0%
favor of having a negotiated contract
 
00:47:04.870 --> 00:47:04.880 align:start position:0%
between the insurance company and and
 
00:47:07.030 --> 00:47:07.040 align:start position:0%
and ambulance services so they can
 
00:47:09.510 --> 00:47:09.520 align:start position:0%
figure it out that realistically and
 
00:47:12.950 --> 00:47:12.960 align:start position:0%
logically let's say it's 32% or 400%
 
00:47:16.109 --> 00:47:16.119 align:start position:0%
let's give that amount I'm saying I'm
 
00:47:18.030 --> 00:47:18.040 align:start position:0%
saying I want you to support my
 
00:47:20.230 --> 00:47:20.240 align:start position:0%
bill yeah your bill doesn't your bill
 
00:47:21.950 --> 00:47:21.960 align:start position:0%
doesn't mandate 35% your bill say that
 
00:47:24.190 --> 00:47:24.200 align:start position:0%
it should be a 204 contracted amount
 
00:47:24.200 --> 00:47:25.829 align:start position:0%
it should be a 204 contracted amount
it's

00:47:25.829 --> 00:47:25.839 align:start position:0%
it's
 
00:47:28.870 --> 00:47:28.880 align:start position:0%
204 calc you don't see it you won't find
 
00:47:32.190 --> 00:47:32.200 align:start position:0%
it in the bill but in the bill it says
 
00:47:36.549 --> 00:47:36.559 align:start position:0%
204% is 204 for this year if we pass it
 
00:47:39.870 --> 00:47:39.880 align:start position:0%
because we hired an outside consultant
 
00:47:41.549 --> 00:47:41.559 align:start position:0%
it wasn't done by the department itself
 
00:47:44.750 --> 00:47:44.760 align:start position:0%
it was somebody else who surveyed all
 
00:47:46.510 --> 00:47:46.520 align:start position:0%
these people in the
 
00:47:49.990 --> 00:47:50.000 align:start position:0%
room and they gave them their
 
00:47:53.390 --> 00:47:53.400 align:start position:0%
numbers and he come back they came back
 
00:47:57.790 --> 00:47:57.800 align:start position:0%
and said that the right number is
 
00:48:00.750 --> 00:48:00.760 align:start position:0%
204 and we can't force them to sign a
 
00:48:02.990 --> 00:48:03.000 align:start position:0%
contract Constitution would not let us
 
00:48:05.309 --> 00:48:05.319 align:start position:0%
force them to sign a contract so that's
 
00:48:09.270 --> 00:48:09.280 align:start position:0%
not an issue well then okay I mean I'll
 
00:48:11.270 --> 00:48:11.280 align:start position:0%
come back to that but another question
 
00:48:13.309 --> 00:48:13.319 align:start position:0%
that I had to ask you when you're saying
 
00:48:15.589 --> 00:48:15.599 align:start position:0%
you you mentioned the statistic that 83%
 
00:48:18.910 --> 00:48:18.920 align:start position:0%
are medic Medicaid patients only 17% are
 
00:48:21.030 --> 00:48:21.040 align:start position:0%
regular insured how good your
 
00:48:22.309 --> 00:48:22.319 align:start position:0%
information is where do you get that
 
00:48:24.750 --> 00:48:24.760 align:start position:0%
information uh this this is this is hard
 
00:48:26.069 --> 00:48:26.079 align:start position:0%
numbers from the insurance department
 
00:48:27.270 --> 00:48:27.280 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
00:48:30.230 --> 00:48:30.240 align:start position:0%
so coming back to that percentage so so
 
00:48:32.829 --> 00:48:32.839 align:start position:0%
you you are proposing 204% some Bill is
 
00:48:35.150 --> 00:48:35.160 align:start position:0%
proposing 3 25% so basically we are just
 
00:48:38.150 --> 00:48:38.160 align:start position:0%
throwing a number from different studies
 
00:48:40.150 --> 00:48:40.160 align:start position:0%
no the
 
00:48:43.750 --> 00:48:43.760 align:start position:0%
325 IS is they winging it just like
 
00:48:46.910 --> 00:48:46.920 align:start position:0%
Maine did for for whatever yeah so
 
00:48:48.430 --> 00:48:48.440 align:start position:0%
that's they're winging the number number
 
00:48:50.990 --> 00:48:51.000 align:start position:0%
just thrown out exactly and and I I I
 
00:48:52.950 --> 00:48:52.960 align:start position:0%
feel very I don't I feel that's
 
00:48:55.670 --> 00:48:55.680 align:start position:0%
irresponsible to take a number like that
 
00:48:58.069 --> 00:48:58.079 align:start position:0%
I think the right way do it is to
 
00:49:00.789 --> 00:49:00.799 align:start position:0%
actually figure out exactly what the
 
00:49:03.150 --> 00:49:03.160 align:start position:0%
insurance companies should be paying
 
00:49:05.309 --> 00:49:05.319 align:start position:0%
yeah so why why why are we mandating
 
00:49:07.549 --> 00:49:07.559 align:start position:0%
that should be part why not we let the
 
00:49:09.390 --> 00:49:09.400 align:start position:0%
insurance company and the provider
 
00:49:11.789 --> 00:49:11.799 align:start position:0%
provider to sit together on the table
 
00:49:13.630 --> 00:49:13.640 align:start position:0%
figure it out what is more
 
00:49:16.789 --> 00:49:16.799 align:start position:0%
reasonable logical and practical number
 
00:49:17.990 --> 00:49:18.000 align:start position:0%
and let them come up with the number
 
00:49:20.069 --> 00:49:20.079 align:start position:0%
rather than we dictating that's not our
 
00:49:22.510 --> 00:49:22.520 align:start position:0%
discussion today did that last year we
 
00:49:25.510 --> 00:49:25.520 align:start position:0%
did that last year had 30 all my years
 
00:49:27.230 --> 00:49:27.240 align:start position:0%
that we've asked them why why can't you
 
00:49:29.670 --> 00:49:29.680 align:start position:0%
guys just work this out and we what we
 
00:49:31.309 --> 00:49:31.319 align:start position:0%
do know is there some of the companies
 
00:49:34.829 --> 00:49:34.839 align:start position:0%
do have contracts but we noticed that
 
00:49:37.270 --> 00:49:37.280 align:start position:0%
those the ones that have contracts are
 
00:49:39.470 --> 00:49:39.480 align:start position:0%
ones that are in high Urban High usage
 
00:49:41.470 --> 00:49:41.480 align:start position:0%
areas those are the ones that have the
 
00:49:43.950 --> 00:49:43.960 align:start position:0%
contracts it's the rural areas the other
 
00:49:47.190 --> 00:49:47.200 align:start position:0%
FR areas that they don't and the and the
 
00:49:49.109 --> 00:49:49.119 align:start position:0%
and the finger was being pointed at the
 
00:49:50.990 --> 00:49:51.000 align:start position:0%
insurance companies that they weren't
 
00:49:53.510 --> 00:49:53.520 align:start position:0%
paying enough and that's what we're
 
00:49:55.589 --> 00:49:55.599 align:start position:0%
trying to solve okay I I get I get your
 
00:49:57.789 --> 00:49:57.799 align:start position:0%
point and uh you know I'm I'm
 
00:49:59.829 --> 00:49:59.839 align:start position:0%
understanding okay uh but there was one
 
00:50:01.990 --> 00:50:02.000 align:start position:0%
email that also came one email that come
 
00:50:03.549 --> 00:50:03.559 align:start position:0%
from one Ambulance Company saying that
 
00:50:06.950 --> 00:50:06.960 align:start position:0%
Howard Pam is paying 50% me I don't know
 
00:50:08.390 --> 00:50:08.400 align:start position:0%
it's so many numbers everybody is
 
00:50:10.589 --> 00:50:10.599 align:start position:0%
sending different different numbers they
 
00:50:12.990 --> 00:50:13.000 align:start position:0%
are saying har was paying 50% other
 
00:50:15.150 --> 00:50:15.160 align:start position:0%
insurance paying like 40 30 like that I
 
00:50:16.030 --> 00:50:16.040 align:start position:0%
think the email came to the whole
 
00:50:17.630 --> 00:50:17.640 align:start position:0%
committee from one of the ambulance
 
00:50:20.349 --> 00:50:20.359 align:start position:0%
provider so which number should we
 
00:50:22.549 --> 00:50:22.559 align:start position:0%
trust how much insurance company is
 
00:50:26.750 --> 00:50:26.760 align:start position:0%
paying well again in terms of what to
 
00:50:30.349 --> 00:50:30.359 align:start position:0%
trust is that we uh at this committee
 
00:50:32.870 --> 00:50:32.880 align:start position:0%
passed last year and I think it was
 
00:50:34.870 --> 00:50:34.880 align:start position:0%
unanimous and when we P we voted for it
 
00:50:37.549 --> 00:50:37.559 align:start position:0%
can we can we talk about insur study now
 
00:50:39.950 --> 00:50:39.960 align:start position:0%
the insurance companies have been trying
 
00:50:42.270 --> 00:50:42.280 align:start position:0%
to get the ambulance providers to sit
 
00:50:44.390 --> 00:50:44.400 align:start position:0%
down and sign contracts with them for
 
00:50:46.710 --> 00:50:46.720 align:start position:0%
years and years and the ambulance
 
00:50:48.990 --> 00:50:49.000 align:start position:0%
providers won't do it because of the
 
00:50:51.470 --> 00:50:51.480 align:start position:0%
problems they've explained and we can't
 
00:50:54.870 --> 00:50:54.880 align:start position:0%
force them to do it we cannot force the
 
00:50:56.990 --> 00:50:57.000 align:start position:0%
two parties to sign the contract if they
 
00:50:58.549 --> 00:50:58.559 align:start position:0%
don't want to do it and they don't want
 
00:50:59.870 --> 00:50:59.880 align:start position:0%
to do
 
00:51:02.870 --> 00:51:02.880 align:start position:0%
it we are
 
00:51:06.670 --> 00:51:06.680 align:start position:0%
indirect sorry thank you so I I just
 
00:51:08.109 --> 00:51:08.119 align:start position:0%
want to pull it back a little bit and
 
00:51:10.549 --> 00:51:10.559 align:start position:0%
refocus on the specific bills that we're
 
00:51:15.069 --> 00:51:15.079 align:start position:0%
discussing here so from from a provider
 
00:51:17.670 --> 00:51:17.680 align:start position:0%
perspective someone that sees patients
 
00:51:20.230 --> 00:51:20.240 align:start position:0%
and EMS providers every single weekend
 
00:51:23.829 --> 00:51:23.839 align:start position:0%
when I'm working I just don't think it's
 
00:51:27.390 --> 00:51:27.400 align:start position:0%
much to ask
 
00:51:30.710 --> 00:51:30.720 align:start position:0%
if the worst case scenario is to pay $5
 
00:51:34.069 --> 00:51:34.079 align:start position:0%
more in premium I don't think that's
 
00:51:38.549 --> 00:51:38.559 align:start position:0%
much to ask to save one person's life if
 
00:51:41.710 --> 00:51:41.720 align:start position:0%
we if it means keeping one EMS provider
 
00:51:43.950 --> 00:51:43.960 align:start position:0%
one extra person on so they can go
 
00:51:46.190 --> 00:51:46.200 align:start position:0%
answer a call while the other two are
 
00:51:51.789 --> 00:51:51.799 align:start position:0%
busy I don't think $5 is the price of a
 
00:51:54.829 --> 00:51:54.839 align:start position:0%
life fair enough so representative spe
 
00:51:56.789 --> 00:51:56.799 align:start position:0%
would very much like to get a little
 
00:51:59.150 --> 00:51:59.160 align:start position:0%
more understanding about how we came up
 
00:52:05.349 --> 00:52:05.359 align:start position:0%
with the 202 number so uh can yeah who's
 
00:52:08.589 --> 00:52:08.599 align:start position:0%
who from the Department would like
 
00:52:10.589 --> 00:52:10.599 align:start position:0%
to so we
 
00:52:12.670 --> 00:52:12.680 align:start position:0%
participated at the beginning of the
 
00:52:15.109 --> 00:52:15.119 align:start position:0%
year uh at the beginning of this
 
00:52:18.510 --> 00:52:18.520 align:start position:0%
session okay right represent spear first
 
00:52:21.069 --> 00:52:21.079 align:start position:0%
yes go ahead we participated at the be
 
00:52:22.990 --> 00:52:23.000 align:start position:0%
uh we asked for last at the end of last
 
00:52:25.510 --> 00:52:25.520 align:start position:0%
year we asked for the uh insurance
 
00:52:27.589 --> 00:52:27.599 align:start position:0%
department to contact all of the
 
00:52:30.670 --> 00:52:30.680 align:start position:0%
providers and give us an analysis of
 
00:52:32.910 --> 00:52:32.920 align:start position:0%
what it would what it actually
 
00:52:35.589 --> 00:52:35.599 align:start position:0%
costs uh for various services within the
 
00:52:39.470 --> 00:52:39.480 align:start position:0%
ambulance providers and they did a study
 
00:52:42.109 --> 00:52:42.119 align:start position:0%
and I hope everybody read
 
00:52:45.230 --> 00:52:45.240 align:start position:0%
it but when we had the discussion last
 
00:52:47.990 --> 00:52:48.000 align:start position:0%
time we were together the ambulance
 
00:52:52.030 --> 00:52:52.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:54.270 --> 00:52:54.280 align:start position:0%
list and showed numbers that were
 
00:52:57.349 --> 00:52:57.359 align:start position:0%
considerably higher than what they may
 
00:53:00.910 --> 00:53:00.920 align:start position:0%
have provided to these
 
00:53:03.589 --> 00:53:03.599 align:start position:0%
folks and yet it's the same set of folks
 
00:53:07.069 --> 00:53:07.079 align:start position:0%
providing the information so I asked the
 
00:53:10.349 --> 00:53:10.359 align:start position:0%
insurance department why are we saying
 
00:53:14.390 --> 00:53:14.400 align:start position:0%
in this document that ALS support one
 
00:53:18.829 --> 00:53:18.839 align:start position:0%
non-emergency is $698 and2 and these
 
00:53:20.789 --> 00:53:20.799 align:start position:0%
folks are saying it's
 
00:53:24.510 --> 00:53:24.520 align:start position:0%
$2,180 And1 when the when the basis for
 
00:53:26.109 --> 00:53:26.119 align:start position:0%
this information came from the same
 
00:53:28.589 --> 00:53:28.599 align:start position:0%
people why are the numbers so
 
00:53:31.270 --> 00:53:31.280 align:start position:0%
different and so the insurance
 
00:53:33.710 --> 00:53:33.720 align:start position:0%
department very kindly did an analysis
 
00:53:35.630 --> 00:53:35.640 align:start position:0%
and they gave me the answer and I'd like
 
00:53:38.190 --> 00:53:38.200 align:start position:0%
them to go over that with
 
00:53:40.910 --> 00:53:40.920 align:start position:0%
you you want this or you have it online
 
00:53:43.349 --> 00:53:43.359 align:start position:0%
so what what was the answer
 
00:53:46.069 --> 00:53:46.079 align:start position:0%
Carrie I I don't want you to think I
 
00:53:48.309 --> 00:53:48.319 align:start position:0%
made up anything hear it from the
 
00:53:51.390 --> 00:53:51.400 align:start position:0%
insurance department thank you so just
 
00:53:53.950 --> 00:53:53.960 align:start position:0%
to clarify in the ambulance study that
 
00:53:56.230 --> 00:53:56.240 align:start position:0%
is based off of the gats data the gats
 
00:54:00.109 --> 00:54:00.119 align:start position:0%
data data has been collected by CMS um
 
00:54:03.470 --> 00:54:03.480 align:start position:0%
from all of the providers over several
 
00:54:06.950 --> 00:54:06.960 align:start position:0%
years as part of this study what the PCG
 
00:54:08.750 --> 00:54:08.760 align:start position:0%
the consultant asked them to do is take
 
00:54:12.030 --> 00:54:12.040 align:start position:0%
that same gats information and submit it
 
00:54:15.030 --> 00:54:15.040 align:start position:0%
to them so that they can use that um as
 
00:54:17.549 --> 00:54:17.559 align:start position:0%
a basis for the analysis so everything
 
00:54:19.829 --> 00:54:19.839 align:start position:0%
in that cost study is from the data
 
00:54:23.470 --> 00:54:23.480 align:start position:0%
being provided by the pro um ambulance
 
00:54:26.349 --> 00:54:26.359 align:start position:0%
service providers um what uh
 
00:54:27.950 --> 00:54:27.960 align:start position:0%
representative spear reached out to us
 
00:54:29.870 --> 00:54:29.880 align:start position:0%
is I believe in the testimony there was
 
00:54:34.430 --> 00:54:34.440 align:start position:0%
a chart um that was provided um that
 
00:54:36.870 --> 00:54:36.880 align:start position:0%
outlined what the proposed rates are and
 
00:54:38.910 --> 00:54:38.920 align:start position:0%
compared to what their build charges
 
00:54:42.430 --> 00:54:42.440 align:start position:0%
were and um for this particular unit um
 
00:54:44.430 --> 00:54:44.440 align:start position:0%
they had been involved in our ambulance
 
00:54:47.270 --> 00:54:47.280 align:start position:0%
uh Summit so back when we were talking
 
00:54:50.430 --> 00:54:50.440 align:start position:0%
about this in the fall of 2023 they had
 
00:54:54.230 --> 00:54:54.240 align:start position:0%
provided a similar chart to us and um we
 
00:54:56.030 --> 00:54:56.040 align:start position:0%
looked back at that and we've noticed
 
00:54:58.630 --> 00:54:58.640 align:start position:0%
that since then their charge rates have
 
00:55:04.069 --> 00:55:04.079 align:start position:0%
increased dramatically um and so when we
 
00:55:07.270 --> 00:55:07.280 align:start position:0%
looked at the analysis um given their um
 
00:55:09.030 --> 00:55:09.040 align:start position:0%
at the time as part of the ambulance
 
00:55:12.390 --> 00:55:12.400 align:start position:0%
study they gave us their payer mix and
 
00:55:15.589 --> 00:55:15.599 align:start position:0%
their um the the mix of the different
 
00:55:18.270 --> 00:55:18.280 align:start position:0%
types of codes that they do so we were
 
00:55:20.190 --> 00:55:20.200 align:start position:0%
able to actually use that and with the
 
00:55:22.510 --> 00:55:22.520 align:start position:0%
proposed rates and the information they
 
00:55:25.670 --> 00:55:25.680 align:start position:0%
gave us for the ambulance study uh for
 
00:55:29.109 --> 00:55:29.119 align:start position:0%
from the ambulance an Summit um we
 
00:55:30.430 --> 00:55:30.440 align:start position:0%
actually anticipate that they'd be
 
00:55:32.710 --> 00:55:32.720 align:start position:0%
getting more money than they were back
 
00:55:35.230 --> 00:55:35.240 align:start position:0%
then so I'm I mean I can't speak to why
 
00:55:37.950 --> 00:55:37.960 align:start position:0%
they increased their rates but um you
 
00:55:40.630 --> 00:55:40.640 align:start position:0%
know we just observe that since so then
 
00:55:42.349 --> 00:55:42.359 align:start position:0%
to now they've increased their rates D
 
00:55:44.789 --> 00:55:44.799 align:start position:0%
so sorry sorry to interrupt because we
 
00:55:48.789 --> 00:55:48.799 align:start position:0%
we use lot of they and they and this and
 
00:55:50.150 --> 00:55:50.160 align:start position:0%
the numbers can you just clarify a
 
00:55:52.750 --> 00:55:52.760 align:start position:0%
little bit so understand you put you get
 
00:55:56.349 --> 00:55:56.359 align:start position:0%
two numbers 2,000 by somebody and then
 
00:55:58.710 --> 00:55:58.720 align:start position:0%
number came to 698 can you in your
 
00:56:02.150 --> 00:56:02.160 align:start position:0%
answer say who was $2,000 by given by
 
00:56:04.750 --> 00:56:04.760 align:start position:0%
whom and how it was $698 part because I
 
00:56:06.470 --> 00:56:06.480 align:start position:0%
I I could understand that part we just
 
00:56:09.150 --> 00:56:09.160 align:start position:0%
use they this and you know it more
 
00:56:10.750 --> 00:56:10.760 align:start position:0%
specific that it be easier yeah so I
 
00:56:12.990 --> 00:56:13.000 align:start position:0%
believe um tilt and nor tilt and
 
00:56:15.910 --> 00:56:15.920 align:start position:0%
Northfield fired in EMS is the the unit
 
00:56:17.910 --> 00:56:17.920 align:start position:0%
we're talking about and they
 
00:56:20.510 --> 00:56:20.520 align:start position:0%
participated in our cost study so in our
 
00:56:21.990 --> 00:56:22.000 align:start position:0%
when we
 
00:56:24.870 --> 00:56:24.880 align:start position:0%
um not in the coste right here but um
 
00:56:27.430 --> 00:56:27.440 align:start position:0%
the ground ambulance Summit so at the
 
00:56:29.549 --> 00:56:29.559 align:start position:0%
time of the ground ambulance Summit they
 
00:56:31.390 --> 00:56:31.400 align:start position:0%
provided us with their charge rates at
 
00:56:33.390 --> 00:56:33.400 align:start position:0%
the time so for that was
 
00:56:35.349 --> 00:56:35.359 align:start position:0%
2000 that was for
 
00:56:39.230 --> 00:56:39.240 align:start position:0%
2022 their rates so we were when we were
 
00:56:40.549 --> 00:56:40.559 align:start position:0%
talking about this at in the fall of
 
00:56:43.349 --> 00:56:43.359 align:start position:0%
2023 they gave us their information
 
00:56:44.910 --> 00:56:44.920 align:start position:0%
which was their most recent data year
 
00:56:50.670 --> 00:56:50.680 align:start position:0%
for 2022 so in 2022 for als1 their rate
 
00:56:54.150 --> 00:56:54.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:58.190 --> 00:56:58.200 align:start position:0%
1283 the ambulance
 
00:57:01.750 --> 00:57:01.760 align:start position:0%
28395 plus mileage and then I believe in
 
00:57:04.029 --> 00:57:04.039 align:start position:0%
the information that they provided in
 
00:57:06.710 --> 00:57:06.720 align:start position:0%
the um I'd have to refer back to it I
 
00:57:15.430 --> 00:57:15.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:19.390 --> 00:57:19.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:24.349 --> 00:57:24.359 align:start position:0%
um so at the time their cost was
 
00:57:27.750 --> 00:57:27.760 align:start position:0%
1,283 our proposed rate for that same
 
00:57:29.750 --> 00:57:29.760 align:start position:0%
code so when it say use the word our who
 
00:57:32.309 --> 00:57:32.319 align:start position:0%
is our here our is from the cost study
 
00:57:35.870 --> 00:57:35.880 align:start position:0%
that was just done okay so your agency
 
00:57:38.910 --> 00:57:38.920 align:start position:0%
so sorry your agency you're saying well
 
00:57:42.789 --> 00:57:42.799 align:start position:0%
PCG the consultant that did it okay
 
00:57:45.710 --> 00:57:45.720 align:start position:0%
consultant rate that they're proposing
 
00:57:45.720 --> 00:57:47.789 align:start position:0%
consultant rate that they're proposing
is

00:57:47.789 --> 00:57:47.799 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:57:50.390 --> 00:57:50.400 align:start position:0%
1,15 no
 
00:57:53.589 --> 00:57:53.599 align:start position:0%
1,15 okay and the ambulance agency rate
 
00:57:57.630 --> 00:57:57.640 align:start position:0%
was 12200 something you said
 
00:57:59.029 --> 00:57:59.039 align:start position:0%
yes that's what they were charging in
 
00:58:01.430 --> 00:58:01.440 align:start position:0%
2022 but in their testimony they're
 
00:58:03.670 --> 00:58:03.680 align:start position:0%
saying now that their rate their current
 
00:58:06.309 --> 00:58:06.319 align:start position:0%
rate for this year is
 
00:58:12.349 --> 00:58:12.359 align:start position:0%
2,180 so just from um 2023 to 2025 their
 
00:58:14.870 --> 00:58:14.880 align:start position:0%
their rate has increased by like 70% and
 
00:58:16.990 --> 00:58:17.000 align:start position:0%
this is the consultant is saying that
 
00:58:19.870 --> 00:58:19.880 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry the consultant is saying that
 
00:58:24.470 --> 00:58:24.480 align:start position:0%
the rate changed from 1,100 to 2,000
 
00:58:26.990 --> 00:58:27.000 align:start position:0%
something in two years the consultant is
 
00:58:28.670 --> 00:58:28.680 align:start position:0%
saying not the ambulance
 
00:58:31.670 --> 00:58:31.680 align:start position:0%
services so their charge rate not what
 
00:58:33.150 --> 00:58:33.160 align:start position:0%
they are collecting but what they're
 
00:58:35.470 --> 00:58:35.480 align:start position:0%
billing for that and I was it the
 
00:58:37.190 --> 00:58:37.200 align:start position:0%
consultant or the ambulance company who
 
00:58:40.069 --> 00:58:40.079 align:start position:0%
said who gave you the higher rate the
 
00:58:43.190 --> 00:58:43.200 align:start position:0%
ambulance provider wasn't the consultant
 
00:58:46.270 --> 00:58:46.280 align:start position:0%
do we have any idea as to the reason for
 
00:58:48.710 --> 00:58:48.720 align:start position:0%
the difference they would have to speak
 
00:58:50.710 --> 00:58:50.720 align:start position:0%
to that okay you want to we just
 
00:58:52.910 --> 00:58:52.920 align:start position:0%
pointing number so can I make a request
 
00:58:55.109 --> 00:58:55.119 align:start position:0%
please when we use the word we they can
 
00:58:57.270 --> 00:58:57.280 align:start position:0%
you just say ambulance service Insurance
 
00:58:58.870 --> 00:58:58.880 align:start position:0%
service and when say they have to speak
 
00:59:00.349 --> 00:59:00.359 align:start position:0%
means please say ambulance service has
 
00:59:02.029 --> 00:59:02.039 align:start position:0%
to speak because then I understand who
 
00:59:03.670 --> 00:59:03.680 align:start position:0%
is they and who is we because it's hard
 
00:59:05.150 --> 00:59:05.160 align:start position:0%
to follow otherwise uh who is
 
00:59:05.160 --> 00:59:06.430 align:start position:0%
to follow otherwise uh who is
representing

00:59:06.430 --> 00:59:06.440 align:start position:0%
representing
 
00:59:10.589 --> 00:59:10.599 align:start position:0%
what I'll try to follow that thank you
 
00:59:12.270 --> 00:59:12.280 align:start position:0%
so the difference between what we
 
00:59:14.510 --> 00:59:14.520 align:start position:0%
supplied to the Gat study and what we're
 
00:59:17.870 --> 00:59:17.880 align:start position:0%
currently doing now is when those rates
 
00:59:20.789 --> 00:59:20.799 align:start position:0%
identify yourself so you know who we is
 
00:59:24.309 --> 00:59:24.319 align:start position:0%
sorry the um I'm Michael sear I'm the
 
00:59:25.710 --> 00:59:25.720 align:start position:0%
chief of the Tilton Northfield fire
 
00:59:25.720 --> 00:59:27.910 align:start position:0%
chief of the Tilton Northfield fire
district

00:59:27.910 --> 00:59:27.920 align:start position:0%
district
 
00:59:31.270 --> 00:59:31.280 align:start position:0%
and when I when I say I'll try to say
 
00:59:34.710 --> 00:59:34.720 align:start position:0%
tnfd rates in 2022 that was supplied to
 
00:59:39.309 --> 00:59:39.319 align:start position:0%
gats those rates were an average uh so
 
00:59:41.309 --> 00:59:41.319 align:start position:0%
I'm uh I have to answer to a board of
 
00:59:43.309 --> 00:59:43.319 align:start position:0%
fire Commissioners and they set the
 
00:59:45.870 --> 00:59:45.880 align:start position:0%
rates I don't set the rates the board of
 
00:59:48.430 --> 00:59:48.440 align:start position:0%
fire Commissioners in in that year were
 
00:59:52.829 --> 00:59:52.839 align:start position:0%
using the average of what our um billing
 
00:59:55.270 --> 00:59:55.280 align:start position:0%
company said that we should be using
 
00:59:56.870 --> 00:59:56.880 align:start position:0%
because of what other people were
 
00:59:58.589 --> 00:59:58.599 align:start position:0%
charging in our
 
01:00:03.510 --> 01:00:03.520 align:start position:0%
area and what they had noticed is that
 
01:00:06.549 --> 01:00:06.559 align:start position:0%
our uh revenues were not matching what
 
01:00:09.950 --> 01:00:09.960 align:start position:0%
our costs were for the ambulance service
 
01:00:11.990 --> 01:00:12.000 align:start position:0%
so they asked me to come up with a
 
01:00:15.630 --> 01:00:15.640 align:start position:0%
formula to to devise how do we actually
 
01:00:18.069 --> 01:00:18.079 align:start position:0%
what does our Ambulance Service cost our
 
01:00:21.230 --> 01:00:21.240 align:start position:0%
taxpayers and since I'm a combined fire
 
01:00:23.910 --> 01:00:23.920 align:start position:0%
department I had to figure out how do I
 
01:00:26.549 --> 01:00:26.559 align:start position:0%
separate the fire costs
 
01:00:30.109 --> 01:00:30.119 align:start position:0%
from the EMS costs so I could say say
 
01:00:31.710 --> 01:00:31.720 align:start position:0%
that if you take an ambulance ride this
 
01:00:33.950 --> 01:00:33.960 align:start position:0%
is how much it's cost so I came up with
 
01:00:36.950 --> 01:00:36.960 align:start position:0%
the formula and I don't have it with me
 
01:00:41.190 --> 01:00:41.200 align:start position:0%
but it's basically we take our operating
 
01:00:43.829 --> 01:00:43.839 align:start position:0%
budget the total number of calls that we
 
01:00:45.029 --> 01:00:45.039 align:start position:0%
do in a
 
01:00:49.470 --> 01:00:49.480 align:start position:0%
year how many of those calls are ems
 
01:00:52.750 --> 01:00:52.760 align:start position:0%
related that percentage approximately
 
01:00:56.230 --> 01:00:56.240 align:start position:0%
70% is really what it cost us to run the
 
01:00:59.750 --> 01:00:59.760 align:start position:0%
ambulance service the other 30% of those
 
01:01:02.670 --> 01:01:02.680 align:start position:0%
calls are fire related calls so 30% of
 
01:01:04.950 --> 01:01:04.960 align:start position:0%
our operating budget you could say is
 
01:01:08.270 --> 01:01:08.280 align:start position:0%
for the fire department I um I have the
 
01:01:10.390 --> 01:01:10.400 align:start position:0%
document in my phone I probably send it
 
01:01:13.750 --> 01:01:13.760 align:start position:0%
to you somehow but
 
01:01:16.870 --> 01:01:16.880 align:start position:0%
anyways That's the basis of it so we
 
01:01:19.029 --> 01:01:19.039 align:start position:0%
take all of
 
01:01:22.510 --> 01:01:22.520 align:start position:0%
those transports that so we say there's
 
01:01:25.390 --> 01:01:25.400 align:start position:0%
1,500 calls and we transported a thou
 
01:01:27.789 --> 01:01:27.799 align:start position:0%
,000 people that
 
01:01:31.870 --> 01:01:31.880 align:start position:0%
70% divided by a th000 is what it cost
 
01:01:35.789 --> 01:01:35.799 align:start position:0%
on the average per ambulance
 
01:01:39.750 --> 01:01:39.760 align:start position:0%
run so the $1,200 figure was based on
 
01:01:41.630 --> 01:01:41.640 align:start position:0%
your billing company giving you an
 
01:01:45.069 --> 01:01:45.079 align:start position:0%
average for for your area and the $2,000
 
01:01:48.710 --> 01:01:48.720 align:start position:0%
figure was based on your calculating um
 
01:01:53.029 --> 01:01:53.039 align:start position:0%
an average per Transportation event yes
 
01:01:54.789 --> 01:01:54.799 align:start position:0%
thank you that's that's the down and
 
01:01:56.829 --> 01:01:56.839 align:start position:0%
dirty up in the beginning in the
 
01:01:58.029 --> 01:01:58.039 align:start position:0%
beginning I didn't hear you said that
 
01:02:00.950 --> 01:02:00.960 align:start position:0%
you're from ambulance services Tilton
 
01:02:00.960 --> 01:02:02.349 align:start position:0%
you're from ambulance services Tilton
Northfield

01:02:02.349 --> 01:02:02.359 align:start position:0%
Northfield
 
01:02:06.510 --> 01:02:06.520 align:start position:0%
fire say it again Tilton Northfield fire
 
01:02:10.630 --> 01:02:10.640 align:start position:0%
fire fire department yes okay so I think
 
01:02:12.670 --> 01:02:12.680 align:start position:0%
what I what um representative spear
 
01:02:14.789 --> 01:02:14.799 align:start position:0%
wanted us to clarify to on that is the
 
01:02:16.829 --> 01:02:16.839 align:start position:0%
way that's described is not an
 
01:02:18.750 --> 01:02:18.760 align:start position:0%
appropriate methodology that's allowed
 
01:02:21.109 --> 01:02:21.119 align:start position:0%
under the Gat study that you're not
 
01:02:23.430 --> 01:02:23.440 align:start position:0%
supposed to be combining those two and
 
01:02:26.069 --> 01:02:26.079 align:start position:0%
then um portioning off a percentage of
 
01:02:28.750 --> 01:02:28.760 align:start position:0%
it what the gats did is required much
 
01:02:32.269 --> 01:02:32.279 align:start position:0%
more detailed cost allocations for um
 
01:02:34.390 --> 01:02:34.400 align:start position:0%
you know how much are you paying for EMS
 
01:02:35.630 --> 01:02:35.640 align:start position:0%
Personnel how much are you paying for
 
01:02:37.390 --> 01:02:37.400 align:start position:0%
ambulance and it goes into a lot more of
 
01:02:40.190 --> 01:02:40.200 align:start position:0%
that granular detail so in the cost
 
01:02:44.150 --> 01:02:44.160 align:start position:0%
analysis done by PCG that is not at all
 
01:02:47.309 --> 01:02:47.319 align:start position:0%
the methodology being used so that's why
 
01:02:49.710 --> 01:02:49.720 align:start position:0%
there is this huge difference so they're
 
01:02:52.069 --> 01:02:52.079 align:start position:0%
not going to line up because that's it's
 
01:02:54.230 --> 01:02:54.240 align:start position:0%
completely different methodology so so
 
01:02:55.870 --> 01:02:55.880 align:start position:0%
sorry to ask a silly question so what is
 
01:02:57.750 --> 01:02:57.760 align:start position:0%
gas stand for and what does PCG stand
 
01:03:00.589 --> 01:03:00.599 align:start position:0%
for PCG is a public Consulting Group
 
01:03:02.950 --> 01:03:02.960 align:start position:0%
they are the consultant that was hired
 
01:03:05.750 --> 01:03:05.760 align:start position:0%
um from the legislation last year to do
 
01:03:08.589 --> 01:03:08.599 align:start position:0%
this work okay what is gats the gats oh
 
01:03:10.710 --> 01:03:10.720 align:start position:0%
gosh it's the ground
 
01:03:13.470 --> 01:03:13.480 align:start position:0%
ambulance data collection
 
01:03:15.950 --> 01:03:15.960 align:start position:0%
survey data collection survey so that
 
01:03:18.549 --> 01:03:18.559 align:start position:0%
that is owned by ambulance services or
 
01:03:21.190 --> 01:03:21.200 align:start position:0%
is it independent no it was a CMS
 
01:03:23.430 --> 01:03:23.440 align:start position:0%
initiative so the federal government had
 
01:03:24.829 --> 01:03:24.839 align:start position:0%
um put together this initiative and
 
01:03:27.150 --> 01:03:27.160 align:start position:0%
they've been doing it for for many years
 
01:03:28.470 --> 01:03:28.480 align:start position:0%
and they're still in the process of
 
01:03:31.750 --> 01:03:31.760 align:start position:0%
collecting all that data what we TR what
 
01:03:34.190 --> 01:03:34.200 align:start position:0%
PCG tried to do in this study was
 
01:03:35.870 --> 01:03:35.880 align:start position:0%
leverage that data that has already been
 
01:03:38.789 --> 01:03:38.799 align:start position:0%
put together because we were only given
 
01:03:40.990 --> 01:03:41.000 align:start position:0%
so the department and PCG were only
 
01:03:42.829 --> 01:03:42.839 align:start position:0%
given a very short amount of time to do
 
01:03:45.950 --> 01:03:45.960 align:start position:0%
this study so we had to leverage those
 
01:03:47.390 --> 01:03:47.400 align:start position:0%
um data points that are existing the
 
01:03:50.069 --> 01:03:50.079 align:start position:0%
gats is a very robust data collection
 
01:03:52.910 --> 01:03:52.920 align:start position:0%
and has a lot of information and it's
 
01:03:55.430 --> 01:03:55.440 align:start position:0%
onerous for the ambulance providers to
 
01:03:57.269 --> 01:03:57.279 align:start position:0%
get that information put it together so
 
01:03:59.150 --> 01:03:59.160 align:start position:0%
what we were trying to do is leverage
 
01:04:00.829 --> 01:04:00.839 align:start position:0%
off of all that work that's already been
 
01:04:03.190 --> 01:04:03.200 align:start position:0%
done and use that as a basis so G of the
 
01:04:05.670 --> 01:04:05.680 align:start position:0%
federal agency all across the country
 
01:04:08.069 --> 01:04:08.079 align:start position:0%
yes okay thank you but for this study we
 
01:04:09.990 --> 01:04:10.000 align:start position:0%
were only looking at New Hampshire
 
01:04:15.430 --> 01:04:15.440 align:start position:0%
providers okay so in the spirit of
 
01:04:18.510 --> 01:04:18.520 align:start position:0%
compromise or working forward on
 
01:04:23.190 --> 01:04:23.200 align:start position:0%
this if were the concerns that maybe
 
01:04:24.710 --> 01:04:24.720 align:start position:0%
where these numbers were came that
 
01:04:27.269 --> 01:04:27.279 align:start position:0%
didn't truly ref ref what was going on
 
01:04:28.630 --> 01:04:28.640 align:start position:0%
in the economy
 
01:04:32.069 --> 01:04:32.079 align:start position:0%
today we can certainly put off the
 
01:04:34.990 --> 01:04:35.000 align:start position:0%
effective date to have another study
 
01:04:37.430 --> 01:04:37.440 align:start position:0%
done but knowing full well that we want
 
01:04:40.549 --> 01:04:40.559 align:start position:0%
it be done every two years to try to get
 
01:04:44.750 --> 01:04:44.760 align:start position:0%
the actual dollars but my My Hope was to
 
01:04:47.789 --> 01:04:47.799 align:start position:0%
pass this and that the new newer dollars
 
01:04:50.190 --> 01:04:50.200 align:start position:0%
the more expensive they have now will
 
01:04:52.069 --> 01:04:52.079 align:start position:0%
show up two years from now when we do
 
01:04:54.549 --> 01:04:54.559 align:start position:0%
this analysis again and then they'll get
 
01:04:56.390 --> 01:04:56.400 align:start position:0%
higher reimbursement rate the difference
 
01:04:58.390 --> 01:04:58.400 align:start position:0%
was like couple of hundred like from
 
01:05:01.430 --> 01:05:01.440 align:start position:0%
12200 to to 2200 it's almost like double
 
01:05:03.789 --> 01:05:03.799 align:start position:0%
so two agencies studying the same thing
 
01:05:07.230 --> 01:05:07.240 align:start position:0%
are reporting 1 1200 and
 
01:05:10.109 --> 01:05:10.119 align:start position:0%
2200 which is a big major gap between
 
01:05:13.750 --> 01:05:13.760 align:start position:0%
two studies which number is reliable
 
01:05:16.670 --> 01:05:16.680 align:start position:0%
well again I think that 2000 was not
 
01:05:18.510 --> 01:05:18.520 align:start position:0%
based off a study that's based off of
 
01:05:20.430 --> 01:05:20.440 align:start position:0%
the equation that he was just ex that
 
01:05:22.589 --> 01:05:22.599 align:start position:0%
was the formula that he he he created he
 
01:05:24.510 --> 01:05:24.520 align:start position:0%
also would have used some data to do it
 
01:05:28.190 --> 01:05:28.200 align:start position:0%
so right use data but again he was there
 
01:05:30.789 --> 01:05:30.799 align:start position:0%
was some mixing of apples and oranges oh
 
01:05:32.470 --> 01:05:32.480 align:start position:0%
okay so should we should we rely on the
 
01:05:35.589 --> 01:05:35.599 align:start position:0%
number first number I'm sorry to okay
 
01:05:37.470 --> 01:05:37.480 align:start position:0%
all right here here's the important
 
01:05:39.950 --> 01:05:39.960 align:start position:0%
thing for me and this this is really
 
01:05:43.990 --> 01:05:44.000 align:start position:0%
what this is all about and that is we
 
01:05:48.269 --> 01:05:48.279 align:start position:0%
charge the insurance department when um
 
01:05:51.269 --> 01:05:51.279 align:start position:0%
to when it comes times for them to set
 
01:05:54.390 --> 01:05:54.400 align:start position:0%
insurance rates we actually require them
 
01:05:57.109 --> 01:05:57.119 align:start position:0%
to any insurance company has got to come
 
01:06:01.549 --> 01:06:01.559 align:start position:0%
in and have some data to defend how they
 
01:06:04.670 --> 01:06:04.680 align:start position:0%
set that premium yes okay how they said
 
01:06:06.990 --> 01:06:07.000 align:start position:0%
that and so what we're now doing is
 
01:06:10.029 --> 01:06:10.039 align:start position:0%
taking that same concept and turning
 
01:06:12.870 --> 01:06:12.880 align:start position:0%
around and saying is and this is totally
 
01:06:15.549 --> 01:06:15.559 align:start position:0%
unusual we don't do this with anything
 
01:06:18.269 --> 01:06:18.279 align:start position:0%
else in the insurance department this is
 
01:06:20.990 --> 01:06:21.000 align:start position:0%
we're breaking new ground here that
 
01:06:23.230 --> 01:06:23.240 align:start position:0%
we're asking them to do that same kind
 
01:06:26.029 --> 01:06:26.039 align:start position:0%
of analysis that's defend our numbers
 
01:06:28.230 --> 01:06:28.240 align:start position:0%
other words tell us show us your numbers
 
01:06:31.549 --> 01:06:31.559 align:start position:0%
of how you come to it how and and and
 
01:06:35.109 --> 01:06:35.119 align:start position:0%
it's got to you know pass the sniff test
 
01:06:37.510 --> 01:06:37.520 align:start position:0%
for the department and if they if you
 
01:06:40.230 --> 01:06:40.240 align:start position:0%
know in terms of this formula he has to
 
01:06:42.470 --> 01:06:42.480 align:start position:0%
defend that formula and how we he's got
 
01:06:44.589 --> 01:06:44.599 align:start position:0%
to give us evidence and proof that that
 
01:06:47.029 --> 01:06:47.039 align:start position:0%
formula that he was using was was the
 
01:06:50.750 --> 01:06:50.760 align:start position:0%
right one okay but that if we if given
 
01:06:52.589 --> 01:06:52.599 align:start position:0%
what we're about to try to do here is
 
01:06:54.470 --> 01:06:54.480 align:start position:0%
totally unique here's going to be
 
01:06:57.349 --> 01:06:57.359 align:start position:0%
glitches I I grant that but all we're
 
01:06:59.870 --> 01:06:59.880 align:start position:0%
trying to do is say is instead of just
 
01:07:02.470 --> 01:07:02.480 align:start position:0%
picking a number out of the air and feel
 
01:07:04.349 --> 01:07:04.359 align:start position:0%
like oh boy we've done
 
01:07:06.470 --> 01:07:06.480 align:start position:0%
something wouldn't it make more sense
 
01:07:09.750 --> 01:07:09.760 align:start position:0%
that we've created a rational system
 
01:07:13.910 --> 01:07:13.920 align:start position:0%
that has is based on real numbers and so
 
01:07:15.950 --> 01:07:15.960 align:start position:0%
that going forward we'll never have to
 
01:07:18.870 --> 01:07:18.880 align:start position:0%
see this legislation again that it it
 
01:07:21.390 --> 01:07:21.400 align:start position:0%
will be resolved until Medicare and
 
01:07:25.710 --> 01:07:25.720 align:start position:0%
Medicaid finally you know pays a rebirth
 
01:07:27.309 --> 01:07:27.319 align:start position:0%
all I can say is for anybody who thinks
 
01:07:29.950 --> 01:07:29.960 align:start position:0%
they wanted to you know Medicare for
 
01:07:32.109 --> 01:07:32.119 align:start position:0%
everybody take
 
01:07:34.789 --> 01:07:34.799 align:start position:0%
note what nightmare you are creating
 
01:07:36.109 --> 01:07:36.119 align:start position:0%
when you think you're going to create
 
01:07:38.309 --> 01:07:38.319 align:start position:0%
Medicare for everybody representative
 
01:07:42.549 --> 01:07:42.559 align:start position:0%
Gibbs thank you um although personally I
 
01:07:44.630 --> 01:07:44.640 align:start position:0%
would rather trust the ambulance
 
01:07:47.069 --> 01:07:47.079 align:start position:0%
companies or the uh fire department
 
01:07:49.230 --> 01:07:49.240 align:start position:0%
ambulance services estimation of their
 
01:07:51.349 --> 01:07:51.359 align:start position:0%
own costs rather than trusting a
 
01:07:54.910 --> 01:07:54.920 align:start position:0%
consulting company uh nevertheless um
 
01:07:57.029 --> 01:07:57.039 align:start position:0%
wouldn't it be better to do something
 
01:08:00.349 --> 01:08:00.359 align:start position:0%
that we can do now rather than wait
 
01:08:02.190 --> 01:08:02.200 align:start position:0%
months or a year or two years for
 
01:08:04.349 --> 01:08:04.359 align:start position:0%
another study well that will happen to
 
01:08:06.670 --> 01:08:06.680 align:start position:0%
your I I was saying if if you guys
 
01:08:09.349 --> 01:08:09.359 align:start position:0%
really want to delay this to figure out
 
01:08:11.870 --> 01:08:11.880 align:start position:0%
the right number I just saying is is
 
01:08:13.990 --> 01:08:14.000 align:start position:0%
that we've got a plan we've got
 
01:08:17.149 --> 01:08:17.159 align:start position:0%
something in front of us and my best
 
01:08:19.550 --> 01:08:19.560 align:start position:0%
advice is let's pass
 
01:08:22.189 --> 01:08:22.199 align:start position:0%
this and and implement this and let's
 
01:08:24.990 --> 01:08:25.000 align:start position:0%
see how it goes and let's see if now I
 
01:08:27.990 --> 01:08:28.000 align:start position:0%
guarantee you even if you pass this
 
01:08:30.789 --> 01:08:30.799 align:start position:0%
325 they'll be be back in two years
 
01:08:33.749 --> 01:08:33.759 align:start position:0%
telling you the number is too low okay
 
01:08:36.189 --> 01:08:36.199 align:start position:0%
and so therefore all I'm trying to do is
 
01:08:38.550 --> 01:08:38.560 align:start position:0%
rationalize a number a reimbursement
 
01:08:42.149 --> 01:08:42.159 align:start position:0%
rate that in hopes cross my fingers they
 
01:08:44.870 --> 01:08:44.880 align:start position:0%
won't be back because the data will be
 
01:08:47.510 --> 01:08:47.520 align:start position:0%
good so data will be right so chairman
 
01:08:51.829 --> 01:08:51.839 align:start position:0%
hunt on on your proposal assumes that uh
 
01:08:54.110 --> 01:08:54.120 align:start position:0%
uh they will be in the network with
 
01:08:55.749 --> 01:08:55.759 align:start position:0%
ambulance so that uh they can work the
 
01:08:58.910 --> 01:08:58.920 align:start position:0%
numbers I I would have to say is there
 
01:09:01.070 --> 01:09:01.080 align:start position:0%
in terms of uh the
 
01:09:06.229 --> 01:09:06.239 align:start position:0%
probability of a u Insurance comp excuse
 
01:09:08.470 --> 01:09:08.480 align:start position:0%
me an ambulance company getting into the
 
01:09:12.950 --> 01:09:12.960 align:start position:0%
network is extremely problematic um as
 
01:09:16.829 --> 01:09:16.839 align:start position:0%
as Mark pointed out it's it's you're
 
01:09:18.349 --> 01:09:18.359 align:start position:0%
you're not calling your primary care
 
01:09:20.229 --> 01:09:20.239 align:start position:0%
physician and saying please make a
 
01:09:22.870 --> 01:09:22.880 align:start position:0%
referral to my in network position my in
 
01:09:26.349 --> 01:09:26.359 align:start position:0%
network so that just doesn't happen
 
01:09:28.229 --> 01:09:28.239 align:start position:0%
the only argument I I heard against it
 
01:09:30.149 --> 01:09:30.159 align:start position:0%
is because the insurance company not
 
01:09:32.030 --> 01:09:32.040 align:start position:0%
paying them enough that's why they don't
 
01:09:33.749 --> 01:09:33.759 align:start position:0%
they don't in the network again that's
 
01:09:36.430 --> 01:09:36.440 align:start position:0%
the only question problem I heard I and
 
01:09:38.349 --> 01:09:38.359 align:start position:0%
but I will have to say to you that I've
 
01:09:40.789 --> 01:09:40.799 align:start position:0%
never heard of a hospital or a primary
 
01:09:42.749 --> 01:09:42.759 align:start position:0%
care physician that ever said that they
 
01:09:44.709 --> 01:09:44.719 align:start position:0%
thought they were getting paid enough
 
01:09:47.950 --> 01:09:47.960 align:start position:0%
okay no Pro provider no service and as a
 
01:09:49.950 --> 01:09:49.960 align:start position:0%
matter of fact when it comes to
 
01:09:52.110 --> 01:09:52.120 align:start position:0%
hospitals you know we the state right
 
01:09:54.030 --> 01:09:54.040 align:start position:0%
out big fat checks to all the hospitals
 
01:09:56.630 --> 01:09:56.640 align:start position:0%
to keep them afloat so you could say
 
01:09:58.669 --> 01:09:58.679 align:start position:0%
well why don't we use that model and
 
01:10:00.510 --> 01:10:00.520 align:start position:0%
just be sending checks directly you know
 
01:10:02.310 --> 01:10:02.320 align:start position:0%
the state should be paying for all these
 
01:10:04.830 --> 01:10:04.840 align:start position:0%
ambulance companies okay but right now
 
01:10:07.149 --> 01:10:07.159 align:start position:0%
our system is set up is that that th
 
01:10:09.390 --> 01:10:09.400 align:start position:0%
those are paid by the cities and towns
 
01:10:13.149 --> 01:10:13.159 align:start position:0%
who actually hire and operate those
 
01:10:16.070 --> 01:10:16.080 align:start position:0%
ambulances thank you um isn't there a
 
01:10:19.030 --> 01:10:19.040 align:start position:0%
federal law called section 1982 which
 
01:10:21.110 --> 01:10:21.120 align:start position:0%
says that everyone has the freedom to
 
01:10:24.590 --> 01:10:24.600 align:start position:0%
contract and doesn't that mean that we
 
01:10:27.470 --> 01:10:27.480 align:start position:0%
cannot force for anyone into a contract
 
01:10:28.830 --> 01:10:28.840 align:start position:0%
corre no one's talking about who's
 
01:10:30.229 --> 01:10:30.239 align:start position:0%
talking about forcing anybody into a
 
01:10:33.229 --> 01:10:33.239 align:start position:0%
contract he's not suggesting that he's
 
01:10:36.110 --> 01:10:36.120 align:start position:0%
not he was just saying would would what
 
01:10:37.709 --> 01:10:37.719 align:start position:0%
what will how you work it out otherwise
 
01:10:39.630 --> 01:10:39.640 align:start position:0%
how do how do you get them to get to a
 
01:10:41.910 --> 01:10:41.920 align:start position:0%
point of a contract and I'm just saying
 
01:10:44.470 --> 01:10:44.480 align:start position:0%
oper listic not a requirement from being
 
01:10:45.990 --> 01:10:46.000 align:start position:0%
here all these years it's just not going
 
01:10:47.750 --> 01:10:47.760 align:start position:0%
to happen and I'm just saying I agree
 
01:10:49.950 --> 01:10:49.960 align:start position:0%
with you it's impossible at the moment
 
01:10:51.550 --> 01:10:51.560 align:start position:0%
good I'm glad we found something we can
 
01:10:53.870 --> 01:10:53.880 align:start position:0%
agree on well you also you also
 
01:10:55.510 --> 01:10:55.520 align:start position:0%
mentioned on your uh Bill saying that by
 
01:10:57.669 --> 01:10:57.679 align:start position:0%
establishing a uniform default rate
 
01:10:59.950 --> 01:10:59.960 align:start position:0%
schedule how I mean that was the first
 
01:11:01.790 --> 01:11:01.800 align:start position:0%
uh uh question I asked in the beginning
 
01:11:03.790 --> 01:11:03.800 align:start position:0%
of our conversation to have why don't
 
01:11:05.310 --> 01:11:05.320 align:start position:0%
why you have different rates and you you
 
01:11:06.669 --> 01:11:06.679 align:start position:0%
are putting the same thing that by
 
01:11:08.270 --> 01:11:08.280 align:start position:0%
establishing uniform default rate
 
01:11:10.990 --> 01:11:11.000 align:start position:0%
schedule how do you how do you uh how do
 
01:11:13.030 --> 01:11:13.040 align:start position:0%
we set that rate is we we hire this
 
01:11:15.709 --> 01:11:15.719 align:start position:0%
outside consultant who gets this data
 
01:11:17.229 --> 01:11:17.239 align:start position:0%
and that then they will give us the
 
01:11:18.669 --> 01:11:18.679 align:start position:0%
recommend dat rate so that definitely is
 
01:11:20.350 --> 01:11:20.360 align:start position:0%
going to serve the purpose that like I
 
01:11:21.950 --> 01:11:21.960 align:start position:0%
said in the beginning that you know I
 
01:11:23.669 --> 01:11:23.679 align:start position:0%
still wonder why the rates are so
 
01:11:25.590 --> 01:11:25.600 align:start position:0%
different by different providers so once
 
01:11:27.470 --> 01:11:27.480 align:start position:0%
you have the uniform rate at least there
 
01:11:29.070 --> 01:11:29.080 align:start position:0%
is some common ground I mean it can
 
01:11:30.470 --> 01:11:30.480 align:start position:0%
differ a little bit depending on
 
01:11:31.950 --> 01:11:31.960 align:start position:0%
location all those things but it don't
 
01:11:34.110 --> 01:11:34.120 align:start position:0%
differ like, and 2,000 like we are
 
01:11:36.590 --> 01:11:36.600 align:start position:0%
seeing in two different studies correct
 
01:11:38.990 --> 01:11:39.000 align:start position:0%
that's why this is the right
 
01:11:41.430 --> 01:11:41.440 align:start position:0%
answer did you hear the explanation that
 
01:11:41.440 --> 01:11:42.229 align:start position:0%
answer did you hear the explanation that
was

01:11:42.229 --> 01:11:42.239 align:start position:0%
was
 
01:11:44.430 --> 01:11:44.440 align:start position:0%
given yeah I heard the explanation but
 
01:11:46.590 --> 01:11:46.600 align:start position:0%
again the that didn't make any sense
 
01:11:48.830 --> 01:11:48.840 align:start position:0%
that why the difference was so big you
 
01:11:51.870 --> 01:11:51.880 align:start position:0%
know one of the problems we have is
 
01:11:54.390 --> 01:11:54.400 align:start position:0%
that a lot of stuff has happened over
 
01:11:56.910 --> 01:11:56.920 align:start position:0%
the last year and a half or two years
 
01:11:58.669 --> 01:11:58.679 align:start position:0%
with respect to this and there's a lot
 
01:12:05.910 --> 01:12:05.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:08.590 --> 01:12:08.600 align:start position:0%
maybe the information is there and it
 
01:12:11.790 --> 01:12:11.800 align:start position:0%
can be explained and maybe this this
 
01:12:13.910 --> 01:12:13.920 align:start position:0%
isn't always the best place to do it but
 
01:12:16.350 --> 01:12:16.360 align:start position:0%
we have a lot of the answers or at least
 
01:12:18.270 --> 01:12:18.280 align:start position:0%
explanations for what you're
 
01:12:20.990 --> 01:12:21.000 align:start position:0%
asking so if you want to sit down with
 
01:12:23.709 --> 01:12:23.719 align:start position:0%
us with me or whoever and and least look
 
01:12:26.030 --> 01:12:26.040 align:start position:0%
at the history I I sat in on every one
 
01:12:30.870 --> 01:12:30.880 align:start position:0%
of these meetings and saw the Michelle
 
01:12:32.870 --> 01:12:32.880 align:start position:0%
hasor Michelle's going to want to speak
 
01:12:36.709 --> 01:12:36.719 align:start position:0%
to it okay if I may um when when PCG was
 
01:12:38.310 --> 01:12:38.320 align:start position:0%
conducting the coste I just want to
 
01:12:40.790 --> 01:12:40.800 align:start position:0%
clarify a couple things that the data
 
01:12:42.990 --> 01:12:43.000 align:start position:0%
they're looking at is data that the
 
01:12:44.950 --> 01:12:44.960 align:start position:0%
ambulance providers are providing this
 
01:12:47.270 --> 01:12:47.280 align:start position:0%
is not independent data this is their
 
01:12:49.390 --> 01:12:49.400 align:start position:0%
data that they have provided and put
 
01:12:51.590 --> 01:12:51.600 align:start position:0%
together about what their costs are what
 
01:12:53.470 --> 01:12:53.480 align:start position:0%
their revenue streams are all of that
 
01:12:55.669 --> 01:12:55.679 align:start position:0%
very detailed information so it is based
 
01:12:57.910 --> 01:12:57.920 align:start position:0%
on that but in analyzing the data there
 
01:13:00.870 --> 01:13:00.880 align:start position:0%
is a wide variation in costs across the
 
01:13:02.830 --> 01:13:02.840 align:start position:0%
state so part of what they're trying to
 
01:13:04.910 --> 01:13:04.920 align:start position:0%
do is come up with a rate that's going
 
01:13:07.709 --> 01:13:07.719 align:start position:0%
to work for the majority of
 
01:13:09.870 --> 01:13:09.880 align:start position:0%
providers but um there's a lot of
 
01:13:12.950 --> 01:13:12.960 align:start position:0%
variation based on rality based off of
 
01:13:16.350 --> 01:13:16.360 align:start position:0%
you know some towns or municipalities
 
01:13:18.750 --> 01:13:18.760 align:start position:0%
invest more into these things so they
 
01:13:22.390 --> 01:13:22.400 align:start position:0%
have um you know more resources maybe
 
01:13:24.510 --> 01:13:24.520 align:start position:0%
than are necessary whereas some maybe
 
01:13:26.270 --> 01:13:26.280 align:start position:0%
don't have enough resources and all of
 
01:13:28.110 --> 01:13:28.120 align:start position:0%
that goes into the cost so there is wide
 
01:13:30.070 --> 01:13:30.080 align:start position:0%
variation among the states so that's
 
01:13:32.149 --> 01:13:32.159 align:start position:0%
part of the reason why we see these um
 
01:13:34.390 --> 01:13:34.400 align:start position:0%
huge differentiations so so we all agree
 
01:13:35.750 --> 01:13:35.760 align:start position:0%
that that definitely needs to be worked
 
01:13:39.310 --> 01:13:39.320 align:start position:0%
out to have some average not like uh
 
01:13:42.110 --> 01:13:42.120 align:start position:0%
very like two different exp yes and
 
01:13:44.189 --> 01:13:44.199 align:start position:0%
that's why if you look at the details of
 
01:13:46.229 --> 01:13:46.239 align:start position:0%
the cost study it goes into a lot more
 
01:13:50.790 --> 01:13:50.800 align:start position:0%
of that detail and the the um consultant
 
01:13:54.830 --> 01:13:54.840 align:start position:0%
PCG um they can be made available um
 
01:13:57.310 --> 01:13:57.320 align:start position:0%
it's difficult they're out of state the
 
01:13:59.189 --> 01:13:59.199 align:start position:0%
the lead person who can speak about
 
01:14:01.750 --> 01:14:01.760 align:start position:0%
everything that went into this study um
 
01:14:03.629 --> 01:14:03.639 align:start position:0%
so we would have to arrange for her to
 
01:14:05.550 --> 01:14:05.560 align:start position:0%
come in person for some kind of joint
 
01:14:08.070 --> 01:14:08.080 align:start position:0%
meeting but we could host the insurance
 
01:14:10.590 --> 01:14:10.600 align:start position:0%
department can host some kind of Q&amp;A
 
01:14:12.669 --> 01:14:12.679 align:start position:0%
session if people want to get more into
 
01:14:15.110 --> 01:14:15.120 align:start position:0%
the details about what was done in this
 
01:14:18.550 --> 01:14:18.560 align:start position:0%
study but the study is very robust and
 
01:14:20.110 --> 01:14:20.120 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of information there in
 
01:14:21.950 --> 01:14:21.960 align:start position:0%
the report so I would just encourage
 
01:14:24.390 --> 01:14:24.400 align:start position:0%
everyone to look at the report I also
 
01:14:25.590 --> 01:14:25.600 align:start position:0%
would like to mention that they didn't
 
01:14:26.910 --> 01:14:26.920 align:start position:0%
come up with one
 
01:14:29.750 --> 01:14:29.760 align:start position:0%
number for each of the different
 
01:14:31.709 --> 01:14:31.719 align:start position:0%
Services they came up with a number for
 
01:14:33.750 --> 01:14:33.760 align:start position:0%
urban a number for Rural and a number
 
01:14:36.229 --> 01:14:36.239 align:start position:0%
for Super Rural right so they didn't try
 
01:14:38.510 --> 01:14:38.520 align:start position:0%
to average it all together in any way
 
01:14:40.590 --> 01:14:40.600 align:start position:0%
they actually tried to break it up by
 
01:14:42.270 --> 01:14:42.280 align:start position:0%
depending on what kind of conditions
 
01:14:44.950 --> 01:14:44.960 align:start position:0%
they were in the study itself is is
 
01:14:46.830 --> 01:14:46.840 align:start position:0%
pretty self-explanatory and it's really
 
01:14:50.030 --> 01:14:50.040 align:start position:0%
quite good just one more thing to add to
 
01:14:53.110 --> 01:14:53.120 align:start position:0%
is the study does adjust for inflation
 
01:14:55.390 --> 01:14:55.400 align:start position:0%
so even though the the data is coming
 
01:14:57.750 --> 01:14:57.760 align:start position:0%
from various years that data was
 
01:15:01.149 --> 01:15:01.159 align:start position:0%
adjusted to account for medical
 
01:15:03.229 --> 01:15:03.239 align:start position:0%
inflation yeah so as long as the
 
01:15:05.590 --> 01:15:05.600 align:start position:0%
ambulance services they stick to those
 
01:15:07.270 --> 01:15:07.280 align:start position:0%
like you say even three subcategories
 
01:15:10.229 --> 01:15:10.239 align:start position:0%
rural urban town whatever as long as
 
01:15:12.790 --> 01:15:12.800 align:start position:0%
their rates are in line with those
 
01:15:15.910 --> 01:15:15.920 align:start position:0%
readings then you can say as your as
 
01:15:18.270 --> 01:15:18.280 align:start position:0%
your bill says have a uniform rate
 
01:15:20.110 --> 01:15:20.120 align:start position:0%
schedule uniform doesn't mean that same
 
01:15:22.510 --> 01:15:22.520 align:start position:0%
rate but at least pertaining to or
 
01:15:24.430 --> 01:15:24.440 align:start position:0%
sticking to that standard being set by
 
01:15:26.790 --> 01:15:26.800 align:start position:0%
someone rather than having your own rate
 
01:15:28.629 --> 01:15:28.639 align:start position:0%
right it's a rational it's a rational
 
01:15:30.030 --> 01:15:30.040 align:start position:0%
number rather than just picking a number
 
01:15:31.629 --> 01:15:31.639 align:start position:0%
out of the sky
 
01:15:34.629 --> 01:15:34.639 align:start position:0%
yeah just one more thing to add to um
 
01:15:36.709 --> 01:15:36.719 align:start position:0%
with respect to Contracting this rate
 
01:15:38.709 --> 01:15:38.719 align:start position:0%
would set a floor there would be nothing
 
01:15:41.149 --> 01:15:41.159 align:start position:0%
prohibiting um the parties into entering
 
01:15:43.310 --> 01:15:43.320 align:start position:0%
to a contract at some other
 
01:15:47.310 --> 01:15:47.320 align:start position:0%
rate say it again this would this rate
 
01:15:50.709 --> 01:15:50.719 align:start position:0%
if it were to pass would set a floor so
 
01:15:52.790 --> 01:15:52.800 align:start position:0%
it would there would be no prohibition
 
01:15:54.990 --> 01:15:55.000 align:start position:0%
the party still could contract and come
 
01:15:57.149 --> 01:15:57.159 align:start position:0%
into Network and negotiate a different
 
01:15:58.470 --> 01:15:58.480 align:start position:0%
rate which is what you're' been
 
01:16:00.830 --> 01:16:00.840 align:start position:0%
suggesting yeah I mean that that again
 
01:16:02.149 --> 01:16:02.159 align:start position:0%
they might they might look at that
 
01:16:04.310 --> 01:16:04.320 align:start position:0%
number and say well maybe it's time to
 
01:16:07.430 --> 01:16:07.440 align:start position:0%
go into a contract and get a higher
 
01:16:09.709 --> 01:16:09.719 align:start position:0%
number well as long as agreeable by both
 
01:16:10.790 --> 01:16:10.800 align:start position:0%
the parties then both the parties are
 
01:16:13.229 --> 01:16:13.239 align:start position:0%
happy exactly
 
01:16:17.550 --> 01:16:17.560 align:start position:0%
exactly okay so um it is quarter to
 
01:16:22.950 --> 01:16:22.960 align:start position:0%
three um this bill um if I'm correct
 
01:16:25.830 --> 01:16:25.840 align:start position:0%
this is the only 38 is the only one is
 
01:16:27.750 --> 01:16:27.760 align:start position:0%
an early
 
01:16:30.510 --> 01:16:30.520 align:start position:0%
bill so just one more comment say say
 
01:16:32.709 --> 01:16:32.719 align:start position:0%
that again chairman hunter that this
 
01:16:36.350 --> 01:16:36.360 align:start position:0%
bill and I just want to make sure want
 
01:16:39.830 --> 01:16:39.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:44.149 --> 01:16:44.159 align:start position:0%
316 uh no no 316 is not an early
 
01:16:46.629 --> 01:16:46.639 align:start position:0%
Bill okay which one one of those was an
 
01:16:48.189 --> 01:16:48.199 align:start position:0%
early Bill wasn't
 
01:16:51.830 --> 01:16:51.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:54.950 --> 01:16:54.960 align:start position:0%
185 so 185 is the one bill we need to
 
01:16:57.629 --> 01:16:57.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:01.270 --> 01:17:01.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:05.590 --> 01:17:05.600 align:start position:0%
is wanted to P the first one let me let
 
01:17:17.590 --> 01:17:17.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:22.149 --> 01:17:22.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:25.149 --> 01:17:25.159 align:start position:0%
document we're talking 185 right see
 
01:17:27.669 --> 01:17:27.679 align:start position:0%
this says says it's not who who has a
 
01:17:31.870 --> 01:17:31.880 align:start position:0%
computer's 36 what does it say on the
 
01:17:35.430 --> 01:17:35.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:38.149 --> 01:17:38.159 align:start position:0%
question chman what is the question
 
01:17:40.470 --> 01:17:40.480 align:start position:0%
represent excuse me Mr St you can come
 
01:17:42.270 --> 01:17:42.280 align:start position:0%
up and speak he's trying to figure out
 
01:17:45.030 --> 01:17:45.040 align:start position:0%
which bills have to be done early so it
 
01:17:48.189 --> 01:17:48.199 align:start position:0%
says 185 on
 
01:17:52.110 --> 01:17:52.120 align:start position:0%
theet that was that was my brother sorry
 
01:17:54.669 --> 01:17:54.679 align:start position:0%
so I think 185 is the only one I got to
 
01:17:58.390 --> 01:17:58.400 align:start position:0%
get get out today oh that's this week
 
01:18:06.990 --> 01:18:07.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:09.629 --> 01:18:09.639 align:start position:0%
6 go ahead what do you got to say thank
 
01:18:12.790 --> 01:18:12.800 align:start position:0%
you uh Chris STW Hall Hampshire I just
 
01:18:14.430 --> 01:18:14.440 align:start position:0%
point of clarification and you mentioned
 
01:18:17.350 --> 01:18:17.360 align:start position:0%
it that your mom got a balance Bill I'm
 
01:18:19.030 --> 01:18:19.040 align:start position:0%
going to assume your mom's on
 
01:18:21.750 --> 01:18:21.760 align:start position:0%
Medicare my mother at the
 
01:18:21.760 --> 01:18:23.149 align:start position:0%
Medicare my mother at the
[Music]

01:18:23.149 --> 01:18:23.159 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:18:26.149 --> 01:18:26.159 align:start position:0%
time yeah yeah she probably was on medic
 
01:18:28.990 --> 01:18:29.000 align:start position:0%
okay Medicare Medicaid Commercial
 
01:18:31.470 --> 01:18:31.480 align:start position:0%
Insurance Medicaid we can't balance Bill
 
01:18:33.390 --> 01:18:33.400 align:start position:0%
anybody take what the state determines
 
01:18:36.030 --> 01:18:36.040 align:start position:0%
is the rate Medicare sets an allowable
 
01:18:38.750 --> 01:18:38.760 align:start position:0%
rate and then they only pay you 80% of
 
01:18:42.030 --> 01:18:42.040 align:start position:0%
that rate you are federally required to
 
01:18:45.149 --> 01:18:45.159 align:start position:0%
balance bill that amount so that's never
 
01:18:47.669 --> 01:18:47.679 align:start position:0%
going to go away no matter what we
 
01:18:50.189 --> 01:18:50.199 align:start position:0%
do and the commercial
 
01:18:52.629 --> 01:18:52.639 align:start position:0%
rate we balance bill because we feel
 
01:18:54.470 --> 01:18:54.480 align:start position:0%
that the reimbursement is inadequate and
 
01:18:57.189 --> 01:18:57.199 align:start position:0%
that's where I got my 20% from so I'm
 
01:18:58.950 --> 01:18:58.960 align:start position:0%
I'm not including the Medicare piece
 
01:19:00.430 --> 01:19:00.440 align:start position:0%
because we can't stop doing that no
 
01:19:01.750 --> 01:19:01.760 align:start position:0%
matter what we all want to do in this
 
01:19:03.510 --> 01:19:03.520 align:start position:0%
room that's still going to happen for
 
01:19:05.750 --> 01:19:05.760 align:start position:0%
everybody I just wanted to clarify that
 
01:19:07.110 --> 01:19:07.120 align:start position:0%
right isn't that interesting that they
 
01:19:09.550 --> 01:19:09.560 align:start position:0%
fixed it for their air ambulances but
 
01:19:12.550 --> 01:19:12.560 align:start position:0%
they left that one and and just one more
 
01:19:14.550 --> 01:19:14.560 align:start position:0%
point the company that I worked for for
 
01:19:16.830 --> 01:19:16.840 align:start position:0%
31 years which serviced nashille and
 
01:19:19.590 --> 01:19:19.600 align:start position:0%
Manchester yes did go out of business it
 
01:19:21.750 --> 01:19:21.760 align:start position:0%
was Rockingham ambulance I spent most of
 
01:19:23.750 --> 01:19:23.760 align:start position:0%
my life there and now I'm with someone
 
01:19:25.750 --> 01:19:25.760 align:start position:0%
else so it does happen so what happened
 
01:19:29.430 --> 01:19:29.440 align:start position:0%
to to all the trucks and all that that
 
01:19:31.270 --> 01:19:31.280 align:start position:0%
they didn't even sell the company they
 
01:19:33.470 --> 01:19:33.480 align:start position:0%
liquidated it it was part of St Joseph's
 
01:19:35.430 --> 01:19:35.440 align:start position:0%
hospital and they hospital hospital and
 
01:19:37.830 --> 01:19:37.840 align:start position:0%
they couldn't afford to run it
 
01:19:41.070 --> 01:19:41.080 align:start position:0%
anymore so that Hospital's gone too
 
01:19:45.669 --> 01:19:45.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:50.510 --> 01:19:50.520 align:start position:0%
to okay so um theoretically uh we we can
 
01:19:52.310 --> 01:19:52.320 align:start position:0%
we can spend a little more time more
 
01:19:54.270 --> 01:19:54.280 align:start position:0%
more thinking about this we don't have
 
01:19:57.310 --> 01:19:57.320 align:start position:0%
to make answer the one bill that I would
 
01:19:59.990 --> 01:20:00.000 align:start position:0%
kind of hope uh we would take up or we
 
01:20:02.149 --> 01:20:02.159 align:start position:0%
can wait till next week because I think
 
01:20:06.550 --> 01:20:06.560 align:start position:0%
I had it schedule again next week um is
 
01:20:11.950 --> 01:20:11.960 align:start position:0%
the is is this three is uh the
 
01:20:15.070 --> 01:20:15.080 align:start position:0%
185 so so chairman one question we so
 
01:20:17.709 --> 01:20:17.719 align:start position:0%
far we have talked about you know
 
01:20:20.350 --> 01:20:20.360 align:start position:0%
Medicare Medicare and insured right how
 
01:20:22.070 --> 01:20:22.080 align:start position:0%
how do we address our do we even address
 
01:20:24.750 --> 01:20:24.760 align:start position:0%
the one who are uninsured and and they
 
01:20:27.590 --> 01:20:27.600 align:start position:0%
they take the ambulance and how how that
 
01:20:30.790 --> 01:20:30.800 align:start position:0%
that is dealt with or it was just uh
 
01:20:32.830 --> 01:20:32.840 align:start position:0%
well you know the good news is the
 
01:20:37.310 --> 01:20:37.320 align:start position:0%
uninsured is only about 5% and uh um but
 
01:20:39.870 --> 01:20:39.880 align:start position:0%
yes it is true that they they would just
 
01:20:44.310 --> 01:20:44.320 align:start position:0%
get balance bills and and they just pay
 
01:20:45.950 --> 01:20:45.960 align:start position:0%
I'm pretty sure they don't
 
01:20:47.910 --> 01:20:47.920 align:start position:0%
probably I don't know do they go to the
 
01:20:50.430 --> 01:20:50.440 align:start position:0%
town welfare department does W I don't
 
01:20:51.709 --> 01:20:51.719 align:start position:0%
know I don't know how so we don't have
 
01:20:54.830 --> 01:20:54.840 align:start position:0%
to worry about that only at this point
 
01:20:56.990 --> 01:20:57.000 align:start position:0%
the problem the meat of this bill the
 
01:20:59.310 --> 01:20:59.320 align:start position:0%
meat of these issues is that we're
 
01:21:01.430 --> 01:21:01.440 align:start position:0%
looking at the fully insured Market
 
01:21:03.910 --> 01:21:03.920 align:start position:0%
because the assumption
 
01:21:06.229 --> 01:21:06.239 align:start position:0%
is insurance
 
01:21:09.669 --> 01:21:09.679 align:start position:0%
company insurance have the de pocket all
 
01:21:13.030 --> 01:21:13.040 align:start position:0%
right and the rap and the people who who
 
01:21:15.830 --> 01:21:15.840 align:start position:0%
they have a system to be able to balance
 
01:21:18.110 --> 01:21:18.120 align:start position:0%
Bill all the premium
 
01:21:21.470 --> 01:21:21.480 align:start position:0%
payers okay that if we stick it to them
 
01:21:24.030 --> 01:21:24.040 align:start position:0%
then they'll just they'll just pass it
 
01:21:26.709 --> 01:21:26.719 align:start position:0%
on and we'll all pay higher premum all
 
01:21:29.070 --> 01:21:29.080 align:start position:0%
of us who fully insured will pay the
 
01:21:31.350 --> 01:21:31.360 align:start position:0%
higher premium okay not me anymore
 
01:21:35.910 --> 01:21:35.920 align:start position:0%
because I'm I'm I'm over 65 now okay but
 
01:21:37.110 --> 01:21:37.120 align:start position:0%
for my
 
01:21:40.310 --> 01:21:40.320 align:start position:0%
employees I as a small employer I would
 
01:21:43.149 --> 01:21:43.159 align:start position:0%
have to pay the de so the issue is is
 
01:21:46.790 --> 01:21:46.800 align:start position:0%
that do this as a solution because other
 
01:21:49.149 --> 01:21:49.159 align:start position:0%
states have done it that way or should
 
01:21:51.149 --> 01:21:51.159 align:start position:0%
we find a good long-term
 
01:21:54.790 --> 01:21:54.800 align:start position:0%
solution that is fair fair urb maybe
 
01:21:56.189 --> 01:21:56.199 align:start position:0%
doesn't give enough money to some
 
01:21:59.310 --> 01:21:59.320 align:start position:0%
people's mind but at least it's fairer
 
01:22:02.470 --> 01:22:02.480 align:start position:0%
than having this current system which is
 
01:22:05.550 --> 01:22:05.560 align:start position:0%
it's a it's basically a user fee and
 
01:22:07.070 --> 01:22:07.080 align:start position:0%
that's what balance billing is it's a
 
01:22:09.189 --> 01:22:09.199 align:start position:0%
user fee you know you use it you're
 
01:22:11.669 --> 01:22:11.679 align:start position:0%
going to get you're G to have to pay and
 
01:22:14.070 --> 01:22:14.080 align:start position:0%
and but because it's Municipal people
 
01:22:15.950 --> 01:22:15.960 align:start position:0%
you know stump their nose and say you
 
01:22:17.510 --> 01:22:17.520 align:start position:0%
know turn it into a paper airplane and
 
01:22:18.990 --> 01:22:19.000 align:start position:0%
throw in trash can so it's more of a
 
01:22:20.910 --> 01:22:20.920 align:start position:0%
collection issue right now it is right
 
01:22:23.950 --> 01:22:23.960 align:start position:0%
now if if everybody paid that bills if
 
01:22:25.310 --> 01:22:25.320 align:start position:0%
that if they B balanced billing was all
 
01:22:27.350 --> 01:22:27.360 align:start position:0%
being paid then there wouldn't be a
 
01:22:29.189 --> 01:22:29.199 align:start position:0%
problem except that people come back and
 
01:22:32.149 --> 01:22:32.159 align:start position:0%
say to us you've got rid of balanced
 
01:22:34.790 --> 01:22:34.800 align:start position:0%
billing for everything else why haven't
 
01:22:36.750 --> 01:22:36.760 align:start position:0%
you got rid of balance billing for this
 
01:22:36.760 --> 01:22:39.229 align:start position:0%
you got rid of balance billing for this
one

01:22:39.229 --> 01:22:39.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:42.990 --> 01:22:43.000 align:start position:0%
category so representative GBS thank you
 
01:22:44.590 --> 01:22:44.600 align:start position:0%
um I'm gonna run something up to the
 
01:22:47.870 --> 01:22:47.880 align:start position:0%
flag poll and see if anybody
 
01:22:51.750 --> 01:22:51.760 align:start position:0%
salutes um uh the suggestion is that the
 
01:22:57.430 --> 01:22:57.440 align:start position:0%
subcommittee recommend um itl on HB 185
 
01:23:00.629 --> 01:23:00.639 align:start position:0%
with the understanding that either 316
 
01:23:03.750 --> 01:23:03.760 align:start position:0%
or 725 will be
 
01:23:11.310 --> 01:23:11.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:13.750 --> 01:23:13.760 align:start position:0%
true uh that would that would solve that
 
01:23:17.590 --> 01:23:17.600 align:start position:0%
one bill yeah the I just said that it it
 
01:23:19.669 --> 01:23:19.679 align:start position:0%
can directly reimburse the ambulance
 
01:23:22.430 --> 01:23:22.440 align:start position:0%
provider yes it says that they pay the
 
01:23:24.709 --> 01:23:24.719 align:start position:0%
entire bill which I don't think is going
 
01:23:26.910 --> 01:23:26.920 align:start position:0%
to FL why can't we just why can't we
 
01:23:30.070 --> 01:23:30.080 align:start position:0%
just itl 185 without any other
 
01:23:32.189 --> 01:23:32.199 align:start position:0%
conditions attached to we would we yeah
 
01:23:33.510 --> 01:23:33.520 align:start position:0%
we we understand we're going to come
 
01:23:35.830 --> 01:23:35.840 align:start position:0%
back and do something oh you I I am
 
01:23:38.590 --> 01:23:38.600 align:start position:0%
bound and determine to pass something
 
01:23:41.870 --> 01:23:41.880 align:start position:0%
and yes I am you know as as everybody
 
01:23:41.880 --> 01:23:42.830 align:start position:0%
and yes I am you know as as everybody
knows

01:23:42.830 --> 01:23:42.840 align:start position:0%
knows
 
01:23:47.910 --> 01:23:47.920 align:start position:0%
I'm I I I have very strong feelings and
 
01:23:50.950 --> 01:23:50.960 align:start position:0%
yes I think the bill that I put in even
 
01:23:52.790 --> 01:23:52.800 align:start position:0%
though it has my name on
 
01:23:55.310 --> 01:23:55.320 align:start position:0%
it you know support of what the
 
01:23:57.470 --> 01:23:57.480 align:start position:0%
committee the committee unanimously
 
01:24:00.910 --> 01:24:00.920 align:start position:0%
agreed to last year so I understand so
 
01:24:03.270 --> 01:24:03.280 align:start position:0%
but at this point if uh you know if if
 
01:24:08.709 --> 01:24:08.719 align:start position:0%
we just uh um itl 185 that would solve
 
01:24:12.270 --> 01:24:12.280 align:start position:0%
the the the problem for NE you know get
 
01:24:13.910 --> 01:24:13.920 align:start position:0%
get past that yeah because if you are
 
01:24:16.669 --> 01:24:16.679 align:start position:0%
struggling on 35% how can this bill says
 
01:24:21.430 --> 01:24:21.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:25.550 --> 01:24:25.560 align:start position:0%
okay okay so we ready to take action on
 
01:24:27.189 --> 01:24:27.199 align:start position:0%

move I move that
 
01:25:13.030 --> 01:25:13.040 align:start position:0%
um HB 185 be here okay so I have a quick
 
01:25:15.390 --> 01:25:15.400 align:start position:0%
question on that though yeah I mean over
 
01:25:17.189 --> 01:25:17.199 align:start position:0%
let me just take this motion first okay
 
01:25:18.430 --> 01:25:18.440 align:start position:0%
okay we have a motion second by
 
01:25:20.310 --> 01:25:20.320 align:start position:0%
representative gives for inex speing to
 
01:25:22.470 --> 01:25:22.480 align:start position:0%
legislate uh we're now open for
 
01:25:24.510 --> 01:25:24.520 align:start position:0%
discussion so the question was that in
 
01:25:26.510 --> 01:25:26.520 align:start position:0%
the analysis portion it says you know
 
01:25:28.149 --> 01:25:28.159 align:start position:0%
for the full amount that's why we it
 
01:25:32.149 --> 01:25:32.159 align:start position:0%
Ling but in the next page it does say
 
01:25:34.229 --> 01:25:34.239 align:start position:0%
somewhere that in the absence of agreed
 
01:25:35.590 --> 01:25:35.600 align:start position:0%
upon rate an insurer shall pay the
 
01:25:36.910 --> 01:25:36.920 align:start position:0%
amount built by the ambulance service
 
01:25:38.750 --> 01:25:38.760 align:start position:0%
provider for the service subject to
 
01:25:41.590 --> 01:25:41.600 align:start position:0%
review by the insurance department oh
 
01:25:43.310 --> 01:25:43.320 align:start position:0%
but it also puts in the event of a
 
01:25:47.189 --> 01:25:47.199 align:start position:0%
dispute dispute yes okay I guess that's
 
01:25:47.199 --> 01:25:49.229 align:start position:0%
dispute dispute yes okay I guess that's
fine

01:25:49.229 --> 01:25:49.239 align:start position:0%
fine
 
01:25:51.430 --> 01:25:51.440 align:start position:0%
yeah I thought they going to rev you'll
 
01:25:53.470 --> 01:25:53.480 align:start position:0%
put it in again next year two years from
 
01:25:57.350 --> 01:25:57.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:57.360 --> 01:25:59.430 align:start position:0%
