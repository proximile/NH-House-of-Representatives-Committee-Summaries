00:22:30.669 --> 00:22:30.679 align:start position:0%
Bill fourth 36 was you may remember it
 
00:22:34.190 --> 00:22:34.200 align:start position:0%
was the for um improving group to
 
00:22:37.350 --> 00:22:37.360 align:start position:0%
require retirement plan for what we call
 
00:22:40.430 --> 00:22:40.440 align:start position:0%
the Gap people it's the people whose uh
 
00:22:45.110 --> 00:22:45.120 align:start position:0%
plan was um 12 years ago was was
 
00:22:49.830 --> 00:22:49.840 align:start position:0%
reduced um and so this was strongly
 
00:22:52.669 --> 00:22:52.679 align:start position:0%
supported by the house we put it into
 
00:22:56.710 --> 00:22:56.720 align:start position:0%
House Bill 2 um it was just as strongly
 
00:22:59.269 --> 00:22:59.279 align:start position:0%
disliked by the Senate it and what they
 
00:23:01.909 --> 00:23:01.919 align:start position:0%
did in the end of the day was created a
 
00:23:05.549 --> 00:23:05.559 align:start position:0%
commission to study the problem and that
 
00:23:08.190 --> 00:23:08.200 align:start position:0%
commission has just finished with a
 
00:23:10.870 --> 00:23:10.880 align:start position:0%
recommendation not very not particularly
 
00:23:13.310 --> 00:23:13.320 align:start position:0%
close it was 8 to well I mean not
 
00:23:16.269 --> 00:23:16.279 align:start position:0%
particularly strongly it was 8 to six
 
00:23:17.909 --> 00:23:17.919 align:start position:0%
but but they they did have a
 
00:23:20.870 --> 00:23:20.880 align:start position:0%
recommendation to do a partial version
 
00:23:22.510 --> 00:23:22.520 align:start position:0%
of of House Bill
 
00:23:26.789 --> 00:23:26.799 align:start position:0%
436 now that's going to become a bill uh
 
00:23:28.990 --> 00:23:29.000 align:start position:0%
that um repres representative leean will
 
00:23:31.070 --> 00:23:31.080 align:start position:0%
be the prime sponsor I'll be a
 
00:23:34.630 --> 00:23:34.640 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor and hopefully others and but
 
00:23:37.149 --> 00:23:37.159 align:start position:0%
it will it'll be handled like a normal
 
00:23:40.590 --> 00:23:40.600 align:start position:0%
bill this coming year in the Edna
 
00:23:45.390 --> 00:23:45.400 align:start position:0%
committee um so that leaves 436 with
 
00:23:48.830 --> 00:23:48.840 align:start position:0%
nothing with no particular purpose and
 
00:23:51.149 --> 00:23:51.159 align:start position:0%
so one of the things that happened in
 
00:23:53.110 --> 00:23:53.120 align:start position:0%
the budget that that particularly
 
00:23:56.510 --> 00:23:56.520 align:start position:0%
annoyed me if you remember house bill 50
 
00:23:58.470 --> 00:23:58.480 align:start position:0%
was the bill that
 
00:24:02.110 --> 00:24:02.120 align:start position:0%
um on the house floor we changed to pay
 
00:24:05.710 --> 00:24:05.720 align:start position:0%
down the unfunded liability by $50
 
00:24:08.630 --> 00:24:08.640 align:start position:0%
million and then we tabled it and put it
 
00:24:11.029 --> 00:24:11.039 align:start position:0%
in the budget well that was also just
 
00:24:14.390 --> 00:24:14.400 align:start position:0%
simply removed by the Senate and so this
 
00:24:18.470 --> 00:24:18.480 align:start position:0%
amendment would turn House Bill 436 into
 
00:24:22.230 --> 00:24:22.240 align:start position:0%
that version of H of house bill 50 that
 
00:24:24.710 --> 00:24:24.720 align:start position:0%
was strongly passed by the house so it
 
00:24:26.990 --> 00:24:27.000 align:start position:0%
would pay down the unfunded liability by
 
00:24:29.350 --> 00:24:29.360 align:start position:0%
$50 million
 
00:24:33.070 --> 00:24:33.080 align:start position:0%
um and um personally I think this is
 
00:24:35.310 --> 00:24:35.320 align:start position:0%
very you know it's a financially it's a
 
00:24:37.430 --> 00:24:37.440 align:start position:0%
good thing to do
 
00:24:41.590 --> 00:24:41.600 align:start position:0%
um the unfunded liability is like debt
 
00:24:43.870 --> 00:24:43.880 align:start position:0%
that's ACR at
 
00:24:48.549 --> 00:24:48.559 align:start position:0%
6.75% interest and so for every dollar
 
00:24:51.389 --> 00:24:51.399 align:start position:0%
we put in today that's like a do7 we
 
00:24:54.029 --> 00:24:54.039 align:start position:0%
don't have to put in a year from now or
 
00:24:56.110 --> 00:24:56.120 align:start position:0%
a11 14 we don't have to put in a year
 
00:24:59.269 --> 00:24:59.279 align:start position:0%
from then and so on and and so um I
 
00:25:02.029 --> 00:25:02.039 align:start position:0%
believe we have extra money that was
 
00:25:05.909 --> 00:25:05.919 align:start position:0%
unspent during the budget period And
 
00:25:08.590 --> 00:25:08.600 align:start position:0%
this is a way of sort of having a mini
 
00:25:11.070 --> 00:25:11.080 align:start position:0%
mini Committee of conference with the
 
00:25:14.590 --> 00:25:14.600 align:start position:0%
Senate and say look we really want this
 
00:25:17.190 --> 00:25:17.200 align:start position:0%
and so um that's that's my
 
00:25:19.710 --> 00:25:19.720 align:start position:0%
proposal so the the motion is not to
 
00:25:23.789 --> 00:25:23.799 align:start position:0%
pass as amended by well I think 2458 Mr
 
00:25:25.350 --> 00:25:25.360 align:start position:0%
chairman we probably should have passed
 
00:25:28.310 --> 00:25:28.320 align:start position:0%
the amendment first or vote on it
 
00:25:30.789 --> 00:25:30.799 align:start position:0%
hopefully pass it and then
 
00:25:33.870 --> 00:25:33.880 align:start position:0%
separ see a show of hands on who was in
 
00:25:35.950 --> 00:25:35.960 align:start position:0%
favor of adopting Amendment
 
00:25:39.549 --> 00:25:39.559 align:start position:0%
2458 raise your hands if you're in
 
00:25:42.950 --> 00:25:42.960 align:start position:0%
favor one two three four five six seven
 
00:25:44.990 --> 00:25:45.000 align:start position:0%
eight nine
 
00:25:52.149 --> 00:25:52.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:56.669 --> 00:25:56.679 align:start position:0%
12 I think it's 14 or 15 those
 
00:25:56.679 --> 00:25:58.590 align:start position:0%
12 I think it's 14 or 15 those
opposed

00:25:58.590 --> 00:25:58.600 align:start position:0%
opposed
 
00:26:04.389 --> 00:26:04.399 align:start position:0%

00:26:07.269 --> 00:26:07.279 align:start position:0%
seven 18 to seven
 
00:26:11.029 --> 00:26:11.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:13.430 --> 00:26:13.440 align:start position:0%
amendment if I could Mr chairman the
 
00:26:15.470 --> 00:26:15.480 align:start position:0%
vote in the division to support the
 
00:26:19.430 --> 00:26:19.440 align:start position:0%
Maguire amendment was four to one
 
00:26:21.950 --> 00:26:21.960 align:start position:0%
okay further discussion anybody want to
 
00:26:25.350 --> 00:26:25.360 align:start position:0%

in expedient to legislate on Senate Bill
 
00:34:15.430 --> 00:34:15.440 align:start position:0%
128 uh unlike the other bills that we've
 
00:34:17.109 --> 00:34:17.119 align:start position:0%
already dealt with so far in committee
 
00:34:19.629 --> 00:34:19.639 align:start position:0%
today uh this bill did not enter into
 
00:34:21.790 --> 00:34:21.800 align:start position:0%
the budget uh however it was a Senate
 
00:34:23.790 --> 00:34:23.800 align:start position:0%
bill that came to us from the Senate
 
00:34:26.069 --> 00:34:26.079 align:start position:0%
when it came to division one we didn't
 
00:34:28.510 --> 00:34:28.520 align:start position:0%
hear anything from the Senate as to the
 
00:34:30.230 --> 00:34:30.240 align:start position:0%
importance of the bill or as to why we
 
00:34:32.510 --> 00:34:32.520 align:start position:0%
needed to fund this program they did not
 
00:34:34.550 --> 00:34:34.560 align:start position:0%
see fit uh to fund it in their version
 
00:34:35.909 --> 00:34:35.919 align:start position:0%
of the budget which they had the final
 
00:34:38.669 --> 00:34:38.679 align:start position:0%
say on um so for that reason we we could
 
00:34:40.750 --> 00:34:40.760 align:start position:0%
not find reason to support an additional
 
00:34:43.149 --> 00:34:43.159 align:start position:0%
expenditure after the budget process was
 
00:34:45.750 --> 00:34:45.760 align:start position:0%
concluded on a on the Senate bill so
 
00:34:47.829 --> 00:34:47.839 align:start position:0%
that's why we're moving in expedient to
 
00:34:52.310 --> 00:34:52.320 align:start position:0%

00:36:33.670 --> 00:36:33.680 align:start position:0%
cells thank you Mr chairman I move uh in
 
00:36:36.190 --> 00:36:36.200 align:start position:0%
expedient to legislate on Senate Bill
 
00:36:39.270 --> 00:36:39.280 align:start position:0%
267 uh similar to Senate Bill 128 this
 
00:36:41.150 --> 00:36:41.160 align:start position:0%
was a Senate bill that got through the
 
00:36:42.750 --> 00:36:42.760 align:start position:0%
Senate came to the house and was not
 
00:36:44.390 --> 00:36:44.400 align:start position:0%
included in the Senate's version of the
 
00:36:48.150 --> 00:36:48.160 align:start position:0%
final budget uh for for funding purposes
 
00:36:50.550 --> 00:36:50.560 align:start position:0%
uh however separately from 128 we did
 
00:36:52.630 --> 00:36:52.640 align:start position:0%
have the Senate uh who sponsored it came
 
00:36:54.630 --> 00:36:54.640 align:start position:0%
into our committee we had a thorough
 
00:36:56.670 --> 00:36:56.680 align:start position:0%
discussion on the policy uh we could
 
00:36:58.030 --> 00:36:58.040 align:start position:0%
could probably spend among our committee
 
00:37:00.550 --> 00:37:00.560 align:start position:0%
today hours discussing the policy of
 
00:37:02.670 --> 00:37:02.680 align:start position:0%
cumulative impact analysis and the road
 
00:37:04.750 --> 00:37:04.760 align:start position:0%
map for that and the potential path that
 
00:37:06.790 --> 00:37:06.800 align:start position:0%
that would take the state down towards
 
00:37:08.710 --> 00:37:08.720 align:start position:0%
uh but so solely on the financial
 
00:37:10.670 --> 00:37:10.680 align:start position:0%
matters this would hire an additional
 
00:37:11.990 --> 00:37:12.000 align:start position:0%
staffer in the Department of
 
00:37:14.190 --> 00:37:14.200 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services to build this
 
00:37:16.710 --> 00:37:16.720 align:start position:0%
program out and to study the potential
 
00:37:19.470 --> 00:37:19.480 align:start position:0%
definition of cumulative impact analysis
 
00:37:22.230 --> 00:37:22.240 align:start position:0%
uh post budget adding an additional
 
00:37:24.710 --> 00:37:24.720 align:start position:0%
staffer uh in my opinion is not a wise
 
00:37:26.950 --> 00:37:26.960 align:start position:0%
move for us to make uh especially when
 
00:37:28.470 --> 00:37:28.480 align:start position:0%
there were other vacancies in the
 
00:37:31.390 --> 00:37:31.400 align:start position:0%
department uh of Staff positions similar
 
00:37:34.109 --> 00:37:34.119 align:start position:0%
to this nature uh and for that reason on
 
00:37:35.870 --> 00:37:35.880 align:start position:0%
the financial side of things I would
 
00:37:38.750 --> 00:37:38.760 align:start position:0%
move inexpedient to legislate and I will
 
00:37:41.829 --> 00:37:41.839 align:start position:0%
second that motion motion to Market
 
00:37:43.990 --> 00:37:44.000 align:start position:0%

00:37:45.750 --> 00:37:45.760 align:start position:0%

uh described the situation with respect
 
00:38:03.230 --> 00:38:03.240 align:start position:0%
to the policy part of the bill um I
 
00:38:05.670 --> 00:38:05.680 align:start position:0%
would remind the committee that from a
 
00:38:08.550 --> 00:38:08.560 align:start position:0%
policy standpoint there was very strong
 
00:38:11.190 --> 00:38:11.200 align:start position:0%
support um on the house floor the bill
 
00:38:14.109 --> 00:38:14.119 align:start position:0%
was unanimously recommended by the house
 
00:38:16.710 --> 00:38:16.720 align:start position:0%
environment and agriculture committee we
 
00:38:18.950 --> 00:38:18.960 align:start position:0%
passed it 302 to
 
00:38:22.349 --> 00:38:22.359 align:start position:0%
77 um this would indeed uh create a
 
00:38:27.030 --> 00:38:27.040 align:start position:0%
position in Dees to review um what there
 
00:38:29.870 --> 00:38:29.880 align:start position:0%
is in existence under New Hampshire law
 
00:38:33.470 --> 00:38:33.480 align:start position:0%
to look at cumulative impacts um but
 
00:38:36.950 --> 00:38:36.960 align:start position:0%
also look uh more broadly at the at the
 
00:38:41.950 --> 00:38:41.960 align:start position:0%
issue the cost to the um budget would be
 
00:38:45.309 --> 00:38:45.319 align:start position:0%
$250,000 for two years as estimated by
 
00:38:48.550 --> 00:38:48.560 align:start position:0%
the um by the department I want to
 
00:38:51.230 --> 00:38:51.240 align:start position:0%
emphasize this does not authorize Dees
 
00:38:53.910 --> 00:38:53.920 align:start position:0%
to take any action it is only
 
00:38:55.750 --> 00:38:55.760 align:start position:0%
authorizing Dees to make a
 
00:38:58.910 --> 00:38:58.920 align:start position:0%
recommendation to the legislature and we
 
00:39:01.069 --> 00:39:01.079 align:start position:0%
could decide uh in the future what we
 
00:39:04.790 --> 00:39:04.800 align:start position:0%
wanted to do I think the point here is
 
00:39:08.750 --> 00:39:08.760 align:start position:0%
that uh under existing law any uh
 
00:39:12.309 --> 00:39:12.319 align:start position:0%
facility that is um being analyzed for
 
00:39:15.510 --> 00:39:15.520 align:start position:0%
the pollutants that it is emitting is
 
00:39:19.109 --> 00:39:19.119 align:start position:0%
looking is being looked at in a siloed
 
00:39:21.990 --> 00:39:22.000 align:start position:0%
approach therefore uh there could be a
 
00:39:24.870 --> 00:39:24.880 align:start position:0%
great deal of say air pollution
 
00:39:28.950 --> 00:39:28.960 align:start position:0%
generally um and and that aspect isn't
 
00:39:31.390 --> 00:39:31.400 align:start position:0%
even looked at they're only looking at
 
00:39:34.790 --> 00:39:34.800 align:start position:0%
this point at permitting the individual
 
00:39:38.430 --> 00:39:38.440 align:start position:0%
facility um I just considering for
 
00:39:42.030 --> 00:39:42.040 align:start position:0%
instance what happened with st gobain p
 
00:39:44.309 --> 00:39:44.319 align:start position:0%
uh there's any number of environmental
 
00:39:48.990 --> 00:39:49.000 align:start position:0%
toxins out there um I would say that
 
00:39:50.990 --> 00:39:51.000 align:start position:0%
looking at things at such a siloed
 
00:39:52.950 --> 00:39:52.960 align:start position:0%
approach is not good for the public
 
00:39:55.630 --> 00:39:55.640 align:start position:0%
health uh for Citizens for the State of
 
00:39:59.190 --> 00:39:59.200 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and for that reason I urge
 
00:40:02.390 --> 00:40:02.400 align:start position:0%
my colleagues to oppose the itl and
 
00:40:06.870 --> 00:40:06.880 align:start position:0%
support an alternative motion thank you

01:01:48.470 --> 01:01:48.480 align:start position:0%
what the 546 does is it establishes 50
 
01:01:51.589 --> 01:01:51.599 align:start position:0%
million net going for school building
 
01:01:55.150 --> 01:01:55.160 align:start position:0%
Aid the current uh leg legis ation or in

the current budget allocates $50 million

M thank you I'd like to make a motion to
 
01:06:56.589 --> 01:06:56.599 align:start position:0%
HB 601
 
01:06:59.990 --> 01:07:00.000 align:start position:0%
FNL um having been both in the finance 2
 
01:07:03.870 --> 01:07:03.880 align:start position:0%
committee Division and in the um joint
 
01:07:05.470 --> 01:07:05.480 align:start position:0%
Senate house committee that looked at
 
01:07:07.829 --> 01:07:07.839 align:start position:0%
the impact of um allowing direct
 
01:07:11.589 --> 01:07:11.599 align:start position:0%
certification you know for medicate for
 
01:07:15.109 --> 01:07:15.119 align:start position:0%
fnr I strongly believe that um this bill
 
01:07:17.430 --> 01:07:17.440 align:start position:0%
needs to be ited the reasons are along
 
01:07:19.990 --> 01:07:20.000 align:start position:0%
the following lines this has been argued
 
01:07:22.789 --> 01:07:22.799 align:start position:0%
as an issue about Hunger kids not having
 
01:07:26.750 --> 01:07:26.760 align:start position:0%
food in schools honestly I've at both
 
01:07:29.510 --> 01:07:29.520 align:start position:0%
the committee with the Senate and also
 
01:07:32.269 --> 01:07:32.279 align:start position:0%
uh I asked a direct question to New
 
01:07:34.150 --> 01:07:34.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire hanger Solutions during the
 
01:07:35.430 --> 01:07:35.440 align:start position:0%
finance 2
 
01:07:37.870 --> 01:07:37.880 align:start position:0%
presentation if they have any data on
 
01:07:40.269 --> 01:07:40.279 align:start position:0%
kids actually not getting fed there is
 
01:07:43.789 --> 01:07:43.799 align:start position:0%
no data there are no anecdotes now if
 
01:07:45.870 --> 01:07:45.880 align:start position:0%
there is an issue the best way to look
 
01:07:48.750 --> 01:07:48.760 align:start position:0%
at it is to look at the um seu having
 
01:07:51.150 --> 01:07:51.160 align:start position:0%
launch debt we do not have state toide
 
01:07:53.750 --> 01:07:53.760 align:start position:0%
data on that we did ask the doe during
 
01:07:55.789 --> 01:07:55.799 align:start position:0%
the Finance to meeting to look for that
 
01:07:59.029 --> 01:07:59.039 align:start position:0%
data and they said they will ask them
 
01:08:00.190 --> 01:08:00.200 align:start position:0%
you know they will ask the school
 
01:08:01.870 --> 01:08:01.880 align:start position:0%
districts about this and gather some
 
01:08:04.269 --> 01:08:04.279 align:start position:0%
information we may be address able to
 
01:08:06.630 --> 01:08:06.640 align:start position:0%
address this in the future the real
 
01:08:08.829 --> 01:08:08.839 align:start position:0%
point of this bill is to change the way
 
01:08:11.950 --> 01:08:11.960 align:start position:0%
uh you know State education funds are
 
01:08:14.789 --> 01:08:14.799 align:start position:0%
distributed having been on the
 
01:08:17.749 --> 01:08:17.759 align:start position:0%
budget process I know that we've already
 
01:08:20.829 --> 01:08:20.839 align:start position:0%
increase the funding by 193 Millions
 
01:08:24.430 --> 01:08:24.440 align:start position:0%
this year part of the funding was
 
01:08:27.269 --> 01:08:27.279 align:start position:0%
allocated considering the fact that this
 
01:08:29.990 --> 01:08:30.000 align:start position:0%
uh you know 7,000 something kids who may
 
01:08:33.149 --> 01:08:33.159 align:start position:0%
be eligible are not enrolled in fnr I
 
01:08:36.110 --> 01:08:36.120 align:start position:0%
think it would be unwise to um make a
 
01:08:38.630 --> 01:08:38.640 align:start position:0%
change outside of the budget process I
 
01:08:41.669 --> 01:08:41.679 align:start position:0%
believe that if this is a program that
 
01:08:43.910 --> 01:08:43.920 align:start position:0%
needs to be discussed it should be
 
01:08:45.829 --> 01:08:45.839 align:start position:0%
during the normal budget process so we
 
01:08:47.590 --> 01:08:47.600 align:start position:0%
can make the necessary changes to the
 
01:08:50.030 --> 01:08:50.040 align:start position:0%
education formula to make sure that the
 
01:08:52.870 --> 01:08:52.880 align:start position:0%
funding is fair for everybody there have
 
01:08:54.910 --> 01:08:54.920 align:start position:0%
also been concern is raised about the
 
01:08:56.590 --> 01:08:56.600 align:start position:0%
privacy of the people involved in the
 
01:08:58.749 --> 01:08:58.759 align:start position:0%
program and over the fact that they you
 
01:09:00.550 --> 01:09:00.560 align:start position:0%
know need to have a choice to not be in
 
01:09:03.430 --> 01:09:03.440 align:start position:0%
a program they may not want to be for
 
01:09:06.229 --> 01:09:06.239 align:start position:0%
all those reasons I you know suggest
 
01:09:08.950 --> 01:09:08.960 align:start position:0%
that the itl is the correct
 
01:09:12.349 --> 01:09:12.359 align:start position:0%
outcome I second the motion I also make
 
01:09:16.870 --> 01:09:16.880 align:start position:0%
the comment that um Medicare if the
 
01:09:18.870 --> 01:09:18.880 align:start position:0%
person may be low income but they may
 
01:09:22.110 --> 01:09:22.120 align:start position:0%
have good insurance from their employer
 
01:09:24.829 --> 01:09:24.839 align:start position:0%
which would negate them being on Decay
 
01:09:28.070 --> 01:09:28.080 align:start position:0%
so we can't assume that qualification
 
01:09:29.749 --> 01:09:29.759 align:start position:0%
for one program is equal to the
 
01:09:31.430 --> 01:09:31.440 align:start position:0%
qualification for the
 
01:09:34.390 --> 01:09:34.400 align:start position:0%
other is there any further discussion on
 
01:09:37.349 --> 01:09:37.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:40.590 --> 01:09:40.600 align:start position:0%
601 seeing none are you ready for the
 
01:09:42.229 --> 01:09:42.239 align:start position:0%
question the clerk will call a rooll on

discussions we've had where we um
 
01:11:43.510 --> 01:11:43.520 align:start position:0%
concluded or at least the majority
 
01:11:46.030 --> 01:11:46.040 align:start position:0%
concluded that this would just not be
 
01:11:48.830 --> 01:11:48.840 align:start position:0%
good policy that past attempts to
 
01:11:50.910 --> 01:11:50.920 align:start position:0%

in a measurable Improvement in the
 
01:11:56.270 --> 01:11:56.280 align:start position:0%
outcome comes and therefore it is not um
 
01:12:00.669 --> 01:12:00.679 align:start position:0%

Mr chairman on Senate Bill 239 if

representative Hull is ready to make a
 
01:31:06.390 --> 01:31:06.400 align:start position:0%
motion for inim study then we can
 
01:31:08.590 --> 01:31:08.600 align:start position:0%
entertain that
 
01:31:13.830 --> 01:31:13.840 align:start position:0%
now sure relative to Senate Bill 239 um
 
01:31:15.510 --> 01:31:15.520 align:start position:0%
the term harm reduction was not well
 
01:31:17.669 --> 01:31:17.679 align:start position:0%
defined we had a lot of discussions on
 
01:31:20.390 --> 01:31:20.400 align:start position:0%
it um this obviously needs additional
 
01:31:22.470 --> 01:31:22.480 align:start position:0%
work I move in from study
 
01:31:25.149 --> 01:31:25.159 align:start position:0%
I will second second by representative
 
01:31:29.430 --> 01:31:29.440 align:start position:0%
kof fall Rec the motion is interim study
 
01:31:32.470 --> 01:31:32.480 align:start position:0%
and I see representative Shapiro has
 
01:31:35.790 --> 01:31:35.800 align:start position:0%
further comments thank you Mr chairman
 
01:31:39.470 --> 01:31:39.480 align:start position:0%
um as previously noted um this is a
 
01:31:42.910 --> 01:31:42.920 align:start position:0%
Senate bill that is meant to
 
01:31:46.229 --> 01:31:46.239 align:start position:0%
codify um harm reduction that's already
 
01:31:46.239 --> 01:31:47.629 align:start position:0%
codify um harm reduction that's already
being

01:31:47.629 --> 01:31:47.639 align:start position:0%
being
 
01:31:51.189 --> 01:31:51.199 align:start position:0%
um that's already exists and is being
 
01:31:52.910 --> 01:31:52.920 align:start position:0%
provided for for in New Hampshire and
 
01:31:55.590 --> 01:31:55.600 align:start position:0%
also to codify the provision of
 
01:31:57.510 --> 01:31:57.520 align:start position:0%
substance misuse Services through the
 
01:31:57.520 --> 01:31:58.870 align:start position:0%
substance misuse Services through the
doorways

01:31:58.870 --> 01:31:58.880 align:start position:0%
doorways
 
01:32:01.910 --> 01:32:01.920 align:start position:0%
program um when it initially came to
 
01:32:03.830 --> 01:32:03.840 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services there was
 
01:32:05.229 --> 01:32:05.239 align:start position:0%
concern that
 
01:32:08.229 --> 01:32:08.239 align:start position:0%
the definition of harm reduction was not
 
01:32:09.910 --> 01:32:09.920 align:start position:0%
specific enough and it would open the
 
01:32:13.149 --> 01:32:13.159 align:start position:0%
door to some kinds of harm reduction
 
01:32:15.070 --> 01:32:15.080 align:start position:0%
activities that are done in other states
 
01:32:17.390 --> 01:32:17.400 align:start position:0%
that we were not ready for here in New
 
01:32:20.669 --> 01:32:20.679 align:start position:0%
Hampshire such as safe injection sites I
 
01:32:23.750 --> 01:32:23.760 align:start position:0%
think um um the other kinds of harm
 
01:32:25.629 --> 01:32:25.639 align:start position:0%
reductions that are already being done
 
01:32:27.950 --> 01:32:27.960 align:start position:0%
here like needle
 
01:32:27.960 --> 01:32:29.750 align:start position:0%
here like needle
exchanges

01:32:29.750 --> 01:32:29.760 align:start position:0%
exchanges
 
01:32:33.629 --> 01:32:33.639 align:start position:0%
um infectious disease
 
01:32:36.870 --> 01:32:36.880 align:start position:0%
reduction overdose reversal through the
 
01:32:40.990 --> 01:32:41.000 align:start position:0%
use of Nao Zone um are already happening
 
01:32:43.550 --> 01:32:43.560 align:start position:0%
here so because of that concern that the
 
01:32:45.430 --> 01:32:45.440 align:start position:0%
definition was not clear enough there
 
01:32:48.669 --> 01:32:48.679 align:start position:0%
was a bipartisan effort to rewrite the
 
01:32:53.189 --> 01:32:53.199 align:start position:0%
definition and a Floren was brought and
 
01:32:57.070 --> 01:32:57.080 align:start position:0%
that amendment was passed 359 to 18 in
 
01:33:00.669 --> 01:33:00.679 align:start position:0%
the full house um broad consensus that
 
01:33:03.669 --> 01:33:03.679 align:start position:0%
that definition was narrow enough and
 
01:33:08.030 --> 01:33:08.040 align:start position:0%
specific enough to allow for harm
 
01:33:11.390 --> 01:33:11.400 align:start position:0%
reduction um that we were already doing
 
01:33:13.430 --> 01:33:13.440 align:start position:0%
um but would not open the doors to
 
01:33:14.830 --> 01:33:14.840 align:start position:0%
things that we did not want to see in
 
01:33:16.950 --> 01:33:16.960 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire it was followed by a Voice
 
01:33:20.550 --> 01:33:20.560 align:start position:0%
vote on the floor and
 
01:33:25.270 --> 01:33:25.280 align:start position:0%
so this this bill if it was to pass
 
01:33:27.550 --> 01:33:27.560 align:start position:0%
would not change anything that was being
 
01:33:29.709 --> 01:33:29.719 align:start position:0%
done here already all these things are
 
01:33:33.870 --> 01:33:33.880 align:start position:0%
already being done here um it would just
 
01:33:35.510 --> 01:33:35.520 align:start position:0%
guarantee that they would be able to be
 
01:33:39.070 --> 01:33:39.080 align:start position:0%
done into the future so I would ask that
 
01:33:42.430 --> 01:33:42.440 align:start position:0%
we um vote no on the motion for interim
 
01:33:44.870 --> 01:33:44.880 align:start position:0%
study so an alternative motion can be
 
01:33:48.629 --> 01:33:48.639 align:start position:0%
made thank you representative cofal is
 
01:33:52.390 --> 01:33:52.400 align:start position:0%
recognized thank you Mr chairman so
 
01:33:54.830 --> 01:33:54.840 align:start position:0%
um as the person who actually brought
 
01:33:58.109 --> 01:33:58.119 align:start position:0%
the floor amendment to clarify the um
 
01:33:59.590 --> 01:33:59.600 align:start position:0%
the definition of harm
 
01:34:02.229 --> 01:34:02.239 align:start position:0%
reduction I obviously voted for that
 
01:34:03.990 --> 01:34:04.000 align:start position:0%
floor Amendment and I voted for the
 
01:34:06.270 --> 01:34:06.280 align:start position:0%
original bill I think the fact that we
 
01:34:08.270 --> 01:34:08.280 align:start position:0%
had such broad support for the original
 
01:34:10.470 --> 01:34:10.480 align:start position:0%
bill or the the bill as Amendment
 
01:34:13.430 --> 01:34:13.440 align:start position:0%
amended on the floor speaks to the fact
 
01:34:15.830 --> 01:34:15.840 align:start position:0%
that there is Broad consensus that we
 
01:34:19.430 --> 01:34:19.440 align:start position:0%
need to do things to reduce harm having
 
01:34:22.910 --> 01:34:22.920 align:start position:0%
said that um I have subsequently learn
 
01:34:24.750 --> 01:34:24.760 align:start position:0%
some new information about harm
 
01:34:27.229 --> 01:34:27.239 align:start position:0%
reduction how that is interpreted in
 
01:34:30.149 --> 01:34:30.159 align:start position:0%
other states and it gives me serious
 
01:34:33.470 --> 01:34:33.480 align:start position:0%
concerns about the legislation even with
 
01:34:36.310 --> 01:34:36.320 align:start position:0%
the clarifying amendment that we brought
 
01:34:37.790 --> 01:34:37.800 align:start position:0%
I would like to see this bill move
 
01:34:40.109 --> 01:34:40.119 align:start position:0%
forward I think that we need to continue
 
01:34:44.550 --> 01:34:44.560 align:start position:0%
to um explore ways to implement harm
 
01:34:45.870 --> 01:34:45.880 align:start position:0%
reduction in New
 
01:34:49.910 --> 01:34:49.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire however um the bill this bill
 
01:34:51.990 --> 01:34:52.000 align:start position:0%
as it is right now
 
01:34:54.470 --> 01:34:54.480 align:start position:0%
is is not ready for prime time I do not
 
01:34:56.070 --> 01:34:56.080 align:start position:0%
feel comfortable with the definition of
 
01:34:57.750 --> 01:34:57.760 align:start position:0%
harm reduction and therefore I believe
 
01:35:01.310 --> 01:35:01.320 align:start position:0%
that a an interim study um interim study
 
01:35:03.350 --> 01:35:03.360 align:start position:0%
is a is is the right path forward for
 
01:35:06.830 --> 01:35:06.840 align:start position:0%
this Bill thank you represent hle thank
 
01:35:09.149 --> 01:35:09.159 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman having spent two years
 
01:35:11.390 --> 01:35:11.400 align:start position:0%
of my life working at a drug and alcohol
 
01:35:13.430 --> 01:35:13.440 align:start position:0%
rehab I have some
 
01:35:15.669 --> 01:35:15.679 align:start position:0%
relevant understanding and experience in
 
01:35:17.950 --> 01:35:17.960 align:start position:0%
this domain I'm not sure all the
 
01:35:19.629 --> 01:35:19.639 align:start position:0%
proposed solutions that are part of harm
 
01:35:21.830 --> 01:35:21.840 align:start position:0%
reduction address some of the underlying
 
01:35:25.270 --> 01:35:25.280 align:start position:0%
mental health issues and environment
 
01:35:27.590 --> 01:35:27.600 align:start position:0%
issues and social issues that drive
 
01:35:30.229 --> 01:35:30.239 align:start position:0%
people to start using elicit
 
01:35:33.310 --> 01:35:33.320 align:start position:0%
drugs um there are things that can be
 
01:35:35.590 --> 01:35:35.600 align:start position:0%
done the bill does not address those I
 
01:35:36.990 --> 01:35:37.000 align:start position:0%
think the best thing we can do is move
 
01:35:38.470 --> 01:35:38.480 align:start position:0%
forward with actually putting some time
 
01:35:41.590 --> 01:35:41.600 align:start position:0%
and effort into this to address those
 
01:35:45.270 --> 01:35:45.280 align:start position:0%
who are abusing their lives their bodies
 
01:35:49.750 --> 01:35:49.760 align:start position:0%
um via medications and um illegal drugs
 
01:35:52.030 --> 01:35:52.040 align:start position:0%
and then start to reduce the number of
 
01:35:55.430 --> 01:35:55.440 align:start position:0%
people who end up dying from some of
 
01:35:58.629 --> 01:35:58.639 align:start position:0%
this any further discussion on a
 
01:36:01.790 --> 01:36:01.800 align:start position:0%

Moone it's fine either
 
01:39:20.040 --> 01:39:24.830 align:start position:0%
Moone it's fine either
one

01:39:24.830 --> 01:39:24.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:27.910 --> 01:39:27.920 align:start position:0%
so s
 
01:39:29.990 --> 01:39:30.000 align:start position:0%
sp263 in its
 
01:39:32.390 --> 01:39:32.400 align:start position:0%
entirety is included
 
01:39:34.629 --> 01:39:34.639 align:start position:0%
exactly in
 
01:39:37.709 --> 01:39:37.719 align:start position:0%
hb2 with one exception and only one
 
01:39:39.109 --> 01:39:39.119 align:start position:0%
exception and I think there are five
 
01:39:41.229 --> 01:39:41.239 align:start position:0%
parts I'm not mistaken to the to the
 
01:39:45.270 --> 01:39:45.280 align:start position:0%
bill the one exception is the term of
 
01:39:48.750 --> 01:39:48.760 align:start position:0%
the extension of Medicaid expansion or
 
01:39:52.149 --> 01:39:52.159 align:start position:0%
the granted Advantage Program in hb2 as
 
01:39:55.950 --> 01:39:55.960 align:start position:0%
we passed it that's a 7-year extension
 
01:39:59.390 --> 01:39:59.400 align:start position:0%
in Sp sp263 that's before us it's it
 
01:40:00.910 --> 01:40:00.920 align:start position:0%
makes it
 
01:40:03.109 --> 01:40:03.119 align:start position:0%
permanent at this point I there's a
 
01:40:04.270 --> 01:40:04.280 align:start position:0%
variety of reasons I think it's a
 
01:40:06.550 --> 01:40:06.560 align:start position:0%
mistake to make it permanent but one of
 
01:40:09.669 --> 01:40:09.679 align:start position:0%
them is we don't really have a clear
 
01:40:13.270 --> 01:40:13.280 align:start position:0%
idea of the costs of the program so this
 
01:40:16.830 --> 01:40:16.840 align:start position:0%
program began uh 5 years ago I believe
 
01:40:19.270 --> 01:40:19.280 align:start position:0%
um and during that time it's gone up in
 
01:40:21.229 --> 01:40:21.239 align:start position:0%
cost which is not unexpected but more
 
01:40:23.669 --> 01:40:23.679 align:start position:0%
than that we had coid which drove up the
 
01:40:25.870 --> 01:40:25.880 align:start position:0%
cost substantially because a state of
 
01:40:28.629 --> 01:40:28.639 align:start position:0%
emergency was declared and then based on
 
01:40:28.639 --> 01:40:29.669 align:start position:0%
emergency was declared and then based on
that

01:40:29.669 --> 01:40:29.679 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:40:32.629 --> 01:40:32.639 align:start position:0%
declaration a what do they call those
 
01:40:34.030 --> 01:40:34.040 align:start position:0%
things they do the
 
01:40:37.910 --> 01:40:37.920 align:start position:0%
executive order thank you Mar Jan was uh
 
01:40:42.030 --> 01:40:42.040 align:start position:0%
done that prevented States from removing
 
01:40:44.669 --> 01:40:44.679 align:start position:0%
people from the Medicaid Program and the
 
01:40:46.589 --> 01:40:46.599 align:start position:0%
Medicaid expansion program so what that
 
01:40:49.629 --> 01:40:49.639 align:start position:0%
meant was somebody who might be on might
 
01:40:51.950 --> 01:40:51.960 align:start position:0%
qualify for Medicaid in a single month
 
01:40:54.709 --> 01:40:54.719 align:start position:0%
wound up being on there for a number of
 
01:40:58.189 --> 01:40:58.199 align:start position:0%
years and that time period did not even
 
01:41:01.910 --> 01:41:01.920 align:start position:0%
lapse at the point when the president
 
01:41:03.629 --> 01:41:03.639 align:start position:0%
indicated that Co was really a thing of
 
01:41:06.310 --> 01:41:06.320 align:start position:0%
the past the the extension the emergency
 
01:41:09.270 --> 01:41:09.280 align:start position:0%
was allowed to extend beyond that time
 
01:41:11.790 --> 01:41:11.800 align:start position:0%
so now people have started coming off
 
01:41:13.870 --> 01:41:13.880 align:start position:0%
that began earlier um this year so the
 
01:41:15.750 --> 01:41:15.760 align:start position:0%
price the the cost will start going back
 
01:41:18.589 --> 01:41:18.599 align:start position:0%
down again but what that tells us is we
 
01:41:20.390 --> 01:41:20.400 align:start position:0%
not much we don't really have a clear
 
01:41:22.510 --> 01:41:22.520 align:start position:0%
understanding of where this program is
 
01:41:24.709 --> 01:41:24.719 align:start position:0%
going and I have a further issue with
 
01:41:26.229 --> 01:41:26.239 align:start position:0%
this program with the granted Advantage
 
01:41:29.709 --> 01:41:29.719 align:start position:0%
Program in particular because as many
 
01:41:31.790 --> 01:41:31.800 align:start position:0%
people are not aware it is not on the
 
01:41:34.149 --> 01:41:34.159 align:start position:0%
budget so it's not easy for any of us to
 
01:41:35.629 --> 01:41:35.639 align:start position:0%
find out what the actual cost of the
 
01:41:38.030 --> 01:41:38.040 align:start position:0%
program is or in fact even how it's
 
01:41:41.189 --> 01:41:41.199 align:start position:0%
funded and while we the house did try to
 
01:41:44.990 --> 01:41:45.000 align:start position:0%
in the budget uh put it require that it
 
01:41:47.790 --> 01:41:47.800 align:start position:0%
be put onto the budget in hb2 the Senate
 
01:41:49.109 --> 01:41:49.119 align:start position:0%
stripped that out in the version of the
 
01:41:51.390 --> 01:41:51.400 align:start position:0%
budget which is what um
 
01:41:53.790 --> 01:41:53.800 align:start position:0%
which is what we passed uh in the
 
01:41:56.470 --> 01:41:56.480 align:start position:0%
spring so two things you know one the
 
01:41:57.870 --> 01:41:57.880 align:start position:0%
fact that we don't have a great track
 
01:42:00.669 --> 01:42:00.679 align:start position:0%
record now to to look at but two going
 
01:42:02.870 --> 01:42:02.880 align:start position:0%
forward is very clear that with a simple
 
01:42:04.229 --> 01:42:04.239 align:start position:0%
Declaration of the state of emergency
 
01:42:05.709 --> 01:42:05.719 align:start position:0%
which doesn't require any laws being
 
01:42:08.189 --> 01:42:08.199 align:start position:0%
passed by Congress the executive branch
 
01:42:09.350 --> 01:42:09.360 align:start position:0%
can then turn around and say well we're
 
01:42:10.709 --> 01:42:10.719 align:start position:0%
not going to let anybody come off with
 
01:42:12.350 --> 01:42:12.360 align:start position:0%
Medicaid again at some point in the
 
01:42:13.629 --> 01:42:13.639 align:start position:0%
future in other words they can change
 
01:42:16.350 --> 01:42:16.360 align:start position:0%
the program without our having um any
 
01:42:18.310 --> 01:42:18.320 align:start position:0%
impact on that without Congress having
 
01:42:19.870 --> 01:42:19.880 align:start position:0%
any impact on that and that will drive
 
01:42:21.870 --> 01:42:21.880 align:start position:0%
up our costs in dependent of anything
 
01:42:23.070 --> 01:42:23.080 align:start position:0%
that we're doing other than having to
 
01:42:25.030 --> 01:42:25.040 align:start position:0%
pass another law at that point in time
 
01:42:27.990 --> 01:42:28.000 align:start position:0%
so for that for those reasons um I
 
01:42:31.189 --> 01:42:31.199 align:start position:0%
recommend that we um kill this so that
 
01:42:34.870 --> 01:42:34.880 align:start position:0%
we have our seven-year extension as or
 
01:42:36.629 --> 01:42:36.639 align:start position:0%
our seven-year extension as in current
 
01:42:39.030 --> 01:42:39.040 align:start position:0%
law and we can revisit this in at at the
 
01:42:42.229 --> 01:42:42.239 align:start position:0%
end of that time frame thank you further
 
01:42:44.350 --> 01:42:44.360 align:start position:0%
discussion I see some lights on
 
01:42:44.360 --> 01:42:48.550 align:start position:0%
discussion I see some lights on
representative

01:42:48.550 --> 01:42:48.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:50.870 --> 01:42:50.880 align:start position:0%
Stringham thank you Mr chair for the
 
01:42:53.390 --> 01:42:53.400 align:start position:0%
past eight years Medicaid expansion has
 
01:42:56.030 --> 01:42:56.040 align:start position:0%
provided Primary Care preventative
 
01:42:58.189 --> 01:42:58.199 align:start position:0%
Services and Specialty Care to
 
01:43:00.750 --> 01:43:00.760 align:start position:0%
low-income residents and workers
 
01:43:02.830 --> 01:43:02.840 align:start position:0%
contributing to the healthier Workforce
 
01:43:05.669 --> 01:43:05.679 align:start position:0%
while reducing uncompensated care and
 
01:43:07.589 --> 01:43:07.599 align:start position:0%
thereby reducing insurance rates in the
 
01:43:10.790 --> 01:43:10.800 align:start position:0%
individual Market s
 
01:43:13.910 --> 01:43:13.920 align:start position:0%
sp263 received strong support from the
 
01:43:16.510 --> 01:43:16.520 align:start position:0%
business and medical community upon its
 
01:43:19.109 --> 01:43:19.119 align:start position:0%
introduction in the Senate and passed on
 
01:43:22.310 --> 01:43:22.320 align:start position:0%
the that body on a unanimous bipartisan
 
01:43:27.189 --> 01:43:27.199 align:start position:0%
vote the house voted 193 to 166 to pass
 
01:43:30.750 --> 01:43:30.760 align:start position:0%
this legislation on May 18th and it was
 
01:43:32.589 --> 01:43:32.599 align:start position:0%
subsequently referred to the finance
 
01:43:33.589 --> 01:43:33.599 align:start position:0%
committee and
 
01:43:35.950 --> 01:43:35.960 align:start position:0%
retained following its retention in
 
01:43:38.310 --> 01:43:38.320 align:start position:0%
house finance uh the seven-year
 
01:43:40.629 --> 01:43:40.639 align:start position:0%
extension of gr estate Advantage was
 
01:43:43.790 --> 01:43:43.800 align:start position:0%
enacted as part of hb2 as my esteemed
 
01:43:46.830 --> 01:43:46.840 align:start position:0%
colleague mentioned uh therefore the
 
01:43:49.070 --> 01:43:49.080 align:start position:0%
fiscal impact of this legislation is
 
01:43:50.390 --> 01:43:50.400 align:start position:0%
already accounted for in the state
 
01:43:50.400 --> 01:43:52.189 align:start position:0%
already accounted for in the state
budget

01:43:52.189 --> 01:43:52.199 align:start position:0%
budget
 
01:43:55.669 --> 01:43:55.679 align:start position:0%
sb263 is sound policy and should again
 
01:43:58.109 --> 01:43:58.119 align:start position:0%
pass the house while the extension
 
01:44:00.669 --> 01:44:00.679 align:start position:0%
enacted in hb2 provide short-term
 
01:44:03.149 --> 01:44:03.159 align:start position:0%
stability by enabling the state to
 
01:44:05.030 --> 01:44:05.040 align:start position:0%
negotiate five-year contracts with
 
01:44:07.709 --> 01:44:07.719 align:start position:0%
Managed Care organizations it does not
 
01:44:09.790 --> 01:44:09.800 align:start position:0%
provide the long-term stability required
 
01:44:12.189 --> 01:44:12.199 align:start position:0%
to meet the medical needs of granted
 
01:44:15.070 --> 01:44:15.080 align:start position:0%
Staters removing the sunset would allow
 
01:44:16.950 --> 01:44:16.960 align:start position:0%
the providers to build infrastructure
 
01:44:20.750 --> 01:44:20.760 align:start position:0%
and provide the workforce necessary to
 
01:44:23.149 --> 01:44:23.159 align:start position:0%
uh meet our state's needs improving the
 
01:44:25.910 --> 01:44:25.920 align:start position:0%
quality of care for everyone getting rid
 
01:44:28.070 --> 01:44:28.080 align:start position:0%
of the sunset doesn't do anything to
 
01:44:31.310 --> 01:44:31.320 align:start position:0%
address the other still can be addressed
 
01:44:32.790 --> 01:44:32.800 align:start position:0%
the other issues that my colleague
 
01:44:35.189 --> 01:44:35.199 align:start position:0%
mentioned as well so I ask everyone to
 
01:44:37.589 --> 01:44:37.599 align:start position:0%

01:44:40.830 --> 01:44:40.840 align:start position:0%
autop pass motion that the house senate
 
01:44:42.830 --> 01:44:42.840 align:start position:0%

just like to add
that

01:44:59.589 --> 01:44:59.599 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:45:03.149 --> 01:45:03.159 align:start position:0%
when house Senate Bill 263 came to the
 
01:45:05.750 --> 01:45:05.760 align:start position:0%
house the first time um before it was
 
01:45:08.109 --> 01:45:08.119 align:start position:0%
sent to the finance committee there were
 
01:45:11.229 --> 01:45:11.239 align:start position:0%
many many amendments that came up for a
 
01:45:13.070 --> 01:45:13.080 align:start position:0%
vote the first amendment that came up
 
01:45:16.790 --> 01:45:16.800 align:start position:0%
for a vote was to limit
 
01:45:19.750 --> 01:45:19.760 align:start position:0%
the extension for six years almost
 
01:45:21.709 --> 01:45:21.719 align:start position:0%
identical to what eventually happened in
 
01:45:26.430 --> 01:45:26.440 align:start position:0%
the budget and um believe me I was happy
 
01:45:28.350 --> 01:45:28.360 align:start position:0%
that it came out seven years in the
 
01:45:32.109 --> 01:45:32.119 align:start position:0%
budget um so when the amendment to limit
 
01:45:34.790 --> 01:45:34.800 align:start position:0%
it to six years came up in the house it
 
01:45:37.510 --> 01:45:37.520 align:start position:0%
was voted down so I just wanted to make
 
01:45:40.950 --> 01:45:40.960 align:start position:0%
it clear that we've already visited this
 
01:45:43.430 --> 01:45:43.440 align:start position:0%
issue of the amount of time of the
 
01:45:46.350 --> 01:45:46.360 align:start position:0%
extension and the house position was
 
01:45:49.750 --> 01:45:49.760 align:start position:0%
to vote down limiting it to six years
 
01:45:52.390 --> 01:45:52.400 align:start position:0%
and keeping it is permanent and I would
 
01:45:55.950 --> 01:45:55.960 align:start position:0%
just um along with my colleague uh urge
 
01:46:00.310 --> 01:46:00.320 align:start position:0%
you to vote this down um so that we can
 
01:46:03.950 --> 01:46:03.960 align:start position:0%
make Medicaid expansion permanent thank
 
01:46:07.430 --> 01:46:07.440 align:start position:0%
