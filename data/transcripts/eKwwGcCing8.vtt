that if there's a Committee Member who's
 
00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:46.240 align:start position:0%

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:07.080 align:start position:0%
relatively familiar to many of you it's
 
00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:09.000 align:start position:0%
uh come before our committee uh a few
 
00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:10.960 align:start position:0%
times now it creates penalties for
 
00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:14.400 align:start position:0%
cruelty to Wildlife the language has
 
00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:16.280 align:start position:0%
been refined over the last three years
 
00:05:18.189 --> 00:05:18.199 align:start position:0%
in close cooperation with the fishing
 
00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:20.600 align:start position:0%
game department drafted primarily by the
 
00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:22.280 align:start position:0%
department lawyer Paul Sanderson with
 
00:05:24.749 --> 00:05:24.759 align:start position:0%
the help of Colonel Jordan it has been
 
00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:27.000 align:start position:0%
placed the language of this um as per
 
00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:28.720 align:start position:0%
this committee's recommendation in years
 
00:05:31.469 --> 00:05:31.479 align:start position:0%
prior placed in Title 18 the fishing
 
00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:34.360 align:start position:0%
game title um and is written in such a
 
00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:36.080 align:start position:0%
way that is workable for both law
 
00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:39.160 align:start position:0%
enforcement and The Hunting Community in
 
00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:41.280 align:start position:0%
fact in providing the highest level of
 
00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:42.880 align:start position:0%
protection that's legally available for
 
00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:44.080 align:start position:0%
the hunting angling and trapping
 
00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:46.440 align:start position:0%
Community this bill also has the support
 
00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:48.240 align:start position:0%
of the Fish and Game
 
00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:50.520 align:start position:0%
Commission uh it was on the consent
 
00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:52.720 align:start position:0%
calendar unanimous out of Criminal
 
00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:54.440 align:start position:0%
Justice last year but unfortunately was
 
00:05:56.710 --> 00:05:56.720 align:start position:0%
one of the casualties of our bodies in
 
00:05:58.029 --> 00:05:58.039 align:start position:0%
action because of
 
00:06:00.469 --> 00:06:00.479 align:start position:0%
covid so
 
00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:02.600 align:start position:0%
cruelty to Wildlife New Hampshire is one
 
00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:04.360 align:start position:0%
of only three states that has no
 
00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:06.560 align:start position:0%
criminal statute currently uh for
 
00:06:08.589 --> 00:06:08.599 align:start position:0%
cruelty to Wildlife I'd like to go over
 
00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:10.360 align:start position:0%
briefly the nuts and bolts it's
 
00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:14.960 align:start position:0%
basically three segments so first the
 
00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:17.120 align:start position:0%
definition of Cruelty if you will notice
 
00:06:18.909 --> 00:06:18.919 align:start position:0%
cruelty is not actually used in the
 
00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:22.080 align:start position:0%
language except in the title um so
 
00:06:25.309 --> 00:06:25.319 align:start position:0%
there's no ambiguous term of Cruelty
 
00:06:28.029 --> 00:06:28.039 align:start position:0%
specifically the term is beat cruly whip
 
00:06:30.469 --> 00:06:30.479 align:start position:0%
torture or mutilate that wording is very
 
00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:33.000 align:start position:0%
specific because it um is in line and
 
00:06:35.230 --> 00:06:35.240 align:start position:0%
identical to our current statute for
 
00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:37.680 align:start position:0%
domestic animals that statute was
 
00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:40.080 align:start position:0%
written obviously about a hundred years
 
00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:42.280 align:start position:0%
ago with things like horses and farm
 
00:06:43.469 --> 00:06:43.479 align:start position:0%
animals in
 
00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:45.960 align:start position:0%
mind but in order to keep consistent
 
00:06:47.309 --> 00:06:47.319 align:start position:0%
with current language that is the
 
00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:50.880 align:start position:0%
language that um that we've gone
 
00:06:53.230 --> 00:06:53.240 align:start position:0%
with uh you'll note that there are two
 
00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:54.840 align:start position:0%
different penalties here one for
 
00:06:56.790 --> 00:06:56.800 align:start position:0%
purposeful Behavior and the other for
 
00:06:59.070 --> 00:06:59.080 align:start position:0%
negligent behavior in criminal law
 
00:07:00.990 --> 00:07:01.000 align:start position:0%
they're actually Four mental culpability
 
00:07:02.950 --> 00:07:02.960 align:start position:0%
States purposeful willingly recklessly
 
00:07:05.830 --> 00:07:05.840 align:start position:0%
and negligently purposeful is
 
00:07:07.629 --> 00:07:07.639 align:start position:0%
premeditated and planned with the
 
00:07:10.670 --> 00:07:10.680 align:start position:0%
explicit goal of doing that exact action
 
00:07:12.950 --> 00:07:12.960 align:start position:0%
it is extremely difficult to prove in
 
00:07:15.909 --> 00:07:15.919 align:start position:0%
court this is reserved for only the most
 
00:07:18.070 --> 00:07:18.080 align:start position:0%
egregious offenses people who actually
 
00:07:20.230 --> 00:07:20.240 align:start position:0%
went out for the explicit purpose of
 
00:07:22.710 --> 00:07:22.720 align:start position:0%
torturing an animal and they planned it
 
00:07:25.510 --> 00:07:25.520 align:start position:0%
ahead of time and that can be proven any
 
00:07:28.909 --> 00:07:28.919 align:start position:0%
other situation or incident would fall
 
00:07:31.469 --> 00:07:31.479 align:start position:0%
under negligent statute purposeful in
 
00:07:33.670 --> 00:07:33.680 align:start position:0%
order to keep consistent with our
 
00:07:37.029 --> 00:07:37.039 align:start position:0%
domestic um uh domestic animal cruelty
 
00:07:40.909 --> 00:07:40.919 align:start position:0%
statute purposeful is a class B felony
 
00:07:44.149 --> 00:07:44.159 align:start position:0%
whereas negligent is a
 
00:07:47.270 --> 00:07:47.280 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor uh it originally I had had
 
00:07:49.469 --> 00:07:49.479 align:start position:0%
put this at Reckless it was one step
 
00:07:52.230 --> 00:07:52.240 align:start position:0%
even higher however Colonel Jordan uh
 
00:07:54.430 --> 00:07:54.440 align:start position:0%
brought to our attention that it is
 
00:07:56.230 --> 00:07:56.240 align:start position:0%
impossible to prosecute someone who is
 
00:07:58.990 --> 00:07:59.000 align:start position:0%
under the influence unless we lower that
 
00:08:00.670 --> 00:08:00.680 align:start position:0%
down to
 
00:08:02.990 --> 00:08:03.000 align:start position:0%
negligent the last section is the
 
00:08:05.790 --> 00:08:05.800 align:start position:0%
affirmative defense section which is the
 
00:08:07.670 --> 00:08:07.680 align:start position:0%
strongest legal protection that exists
 
00:08:10.070 --> 00:08:10.080 align:start position:0%
it says that even if a defendant can be
 
00:08:12.629 --> 00:08:12.639 align:start position:0%
proven say you have video of the
 
00:08:15.350 --> 00:08:15.360 align:start position:0%
incident happening even if it can be
 
00:08:17.149 --> 00:08:17.159 align:start position:0%
proven that the defendant committed the
 
00:08:21.070 --> 00:08:21.080 align:start position:0%
crime in certain cases uh excuse me that
 
00:08:22.670 --> 00:08:22.680 align:start position:0%
if uh in certain cases in this case
 
00:08:24.830 --> 00:08:24.840 align:start position:0%
being if they are acting in in lawfully
 
00:08:26.629 --> 00:08:26.639 align:start position:0%
according to tile 18 the jury will be
 
00:08:29.629 --> 00:08:29.639 align:start position:0%
instructed to acit meaning that no utor
 
00:08:31.829 --> 00:08:31.839 align:start position:0%
would ever even begin that
 
00:08:34.149 --> 00:08:34.159 align:start position:0%
prosecution um so the language is it
 
00:08:36.469 --> 00:08:36.479 align:start position:0%
shall be an affirmative defense to to
 
00:08:39.350 --> 00:08:39.360 align:start position:0%
prosecution and an actor shall be exempt
 
00:08:40.750 --> 00:08:40.760 align:start position:0%
from enhanced penalties under this
 
00:08:42.990 --> 00:08:43.000 align:start position:0%
section for any manner of taking Open
 
00:08:45.389 --> 00:08:45.399 align:start position:0%
Season time limits permitted scientific
 
00:08:47.389 --> 00:08:47.399 align:start position:0%
investigations or wildlife management
 
00:08:50.790 --> 00:08:50.800 align:start position:0%
practices lawful under Title 18 whether
 
00:08:53.670 --> 00:08:53.680 align:start position:0%
or not the actor holds a current invalid
 
00:08:56.630 --> 00:08:56.640 align:start position:0%
license so again even if there's a video
 
00:08:59.230 --> 00:08:59.240 align:start position:0%
of just the most awful Behavior if that
 
00:09:01.870 --> 00:09:01.880 align:start position:0%
person was engaged in a lawful activity
 
00:09:04.430 --> 00:09:04.440 align:start position:0%
under 18 that jury would be instructed
 
00:09:06.710 --> 00:09:06.720 align:start position:0%
to acquit even if that person didn't
 
00:09:08.710 --> 00:09:08.720 align:start position:0%
have a hunting fishing or trapping
 
00:09:11.750 --> 00:09:11.760 align:start position:0%
license there is no stronger
 
00:09:13.910 --> 00:09:13.920 align:start position:0%
protection so just briefly I just want
 
00:09:15.870 --> 00:09:15.880 align:start position:0%
to talk about why this is necessary I
 
00:09:18.069 --> 00:09:18.079 align:start position:0%
did say 47 other states have it
 
00:09:20.230 --> 00:09:20.240 align:start position:0%
including all of the best hunting states
 
00:09:22.389 --> 00:09:22.399 align:start position:0%
states of every political strike you can
 
00:09:25.190 --> 00:09:25.200 align:start position:0%
imagine and the reason
 
00:09:28.990 --> 00:09:29.000 align:start position:0%
is this happens in fact when we had our
 
00:09:31.069 --> 00:09:31.079 align:start position:0%
uh first hearing it was not my bill it
 
00:09:32.630 --> 00:09:32.640 align:start position:0%
was another Representatives Bill and I
 
00:09:33.750 --> 00:09:33.760 align:start position:0%
was sitting as a member on this
 
00:09:36.350 --> 00:09:36.360 align:start position:0%
committee it was and I've been here for
 
00:09:38.030 --> 00:09:38.040 align:start position:0%
a while and I I worked up here for a
 
00:09:40.389 --> 00:09:40.399 align:start position:0%
while I've seen many committee hearings
 
00:09:43.750 --> 00:09:43.760 align:start position:0%
it was one of the most gut riching
 
00:09:46.550 --> 00:09:46.560 align:start position:0%
hearings I've had to go through there
 
00:09:49.269 --> 00:09:49.279 align:start position:0%
was testimony that Turtles had been run
 
00:09:51.110 --> 00:09:51.120 align:start position:0%
through with a screwdriver haved with a
 
00:09:53.630 --> 00:09:53.640 align:start position:0%
Cleaver and left to die raccoons and
 
00:09:55.710 --> 00:09:55.720 align:start position:0%
other animals chapped in cages with
 
00:09:58.470 --> 00:09:58.480 align:start position:0%
fireworks lit in the cage some set
 
00:09:59.750 --> 00:09:59.760 align:start position:0%
directly on
 
00:10:03.230 --> 00:10:03.240 align:start position:0%
fire um these were testimonies given by
 
00:10:06.310 --> 00:10:06.320 align:start position:0%
multiple Wildlife
 
00:10:09.670 --> 00:10:09.680 align:start position:0%
rehabilitators so while that in and of
 
00:10:15.230 --> 00:10:15.240 align:start position:0%
itself is a morally um abhorent thing to
 
00:10:18.350 --> 00:10:18.360 align:start position:0%
imagine there's a more I guess um
 
00:10:20.790 --> 00:10:20.800 align:start position:0%
Salient point to this the people who do
 
00:10:23.829 --> 00:10:23.839 align:start position:0%
this kind of behavior rarely stop with
 
00:10:26.389 --> 00:10:26.399 align:start position:0%
animals in fact one of the people who
 
00:10:29.389 --> 00:10:29.399 align:start position:0%
testified in that first hearing was a
 
00:10:31.710 --> 00:10:31.720 align:start position:0%
woman who grew up near a boy who
 
00:10:33.430 --> 00:10:33.440 align:start position:0%
frequently would torture and kill wild
 
00:10:37.069 --> 00:10:37.079 align:start position:0%
birds until one day he came after her
 
00:10:38.910 --> 00:10:38.920 align:start position:0%
now she had managed to escape but
 
00:10:41.230 --> 00:10:41.240 align:start position:0%
eventually after years of practicing he
 
00:10:42.990 --> 00:10:43.000 align:start position:0%
went after another person and bashed
 
00:10:44.870 --> 00:10:44.880 align:start position:0%
that boy's brains in and sexually
 
00:10:47.389 --> 00:10:47.399 align:start position:0%
molested his body by the time he was
 
00:10:49.389 --> 00:10:49.399 align:start position:0%
caught he had become one of the few
 
00:10:51.350 --> 00:10:51.360 align:start position:0%
famous serial killers in New Hampshire
 
00:10:53.870 --> 00:10:53.880 align:start position:0%
his name was Terry RM he was known more
 
00:10:55.670 --> 00:10:55.680 align:start position:0%
frequently as Bob
 
00:10:58.350 --> 00:10:58.360 align:start position:0%
Evans like many sociopaths he had
 
00:11:00.310 --> 00:11:00.320 align:start position:0%
practiced fre ly on Wildlife because
 
00:11:04.629 --> 00:11:04.639 align:start position:0%
Wildlife unlike domestic animals no one
 
00:11:07.110 --> 00:11:07.120 align:start position:0%
misses so having a criminal statue
 
00:11:08.910 --> 00:11:08.920 align:start position:0%
allows us to intervene in these types of
 
00:11:11.990 --> 00:11:12.000 align:start position:0%
situations before sociopaths graduate to
 
00:11:14.790 --> 00:11:14.800 align:start position:0%
murdering people but I would also say
 
00:11:17.750 --> 00:11:17.760 align:start position:0%
it's worth just protecting Wildlife we
 
00:11:20.389 --> 00:11:20.399 align:start position:0%
all know that animals can suffer we most
 
00:11:22.990 --> 00:11:23.000 align:start position:0%
of us have pets of our own or or farm
 
00:11:25.030 --> 00:11:25.040 align:start position:0%
animals we would not want those animals
 
00:11:26.910 --> 00:11:26.920 align:start position:0%
to suffer Wildlife are just as capable
 
00:11:30.110 --> 00:11:30.120 align:start position:0%
of experiencing that we are so proud of
 
00:11:31.710 --> 00:11:31.720 align:start position:0%
our wildlife in this state we are
 
00:11:35.110 --> 00:11:35.120 align:start position:0%
proudly rural we put images of moose and
 
00:11:37.790 --> 00:11:37.800 align:start position:0%
bear on t-shirts and our license plates
 
00:11:40.350 --> 00:11:40.360 align:start position:0%
and I think that if we really love them
 
00:11:41.870 --> 00:11:41.880 align:start position:0%
the way that we act we should afford
 
00:11:43.910 --> 00:11:43.920 align:start position:0%
them this protection and I'm happy to
 
00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:45.470 align:start position:0%
them this protection and I'm happy to
take

00:11:45.470 --> 00:11:45.480 align:start position:0%
take
 
00:11:47.509 --> 00:11:47.519 align:start position:0%
questions thank you representative reer
 
00:11:51.230 --> 00:11:51.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:54.710 --> 00:11:54.720 align:start position:0%
Reed representative
 
00:11:57.949 --> 00:11:57.959 align:start position:0%
Harvey press the red button until you're
 
00:12:00.949 --> 00:12:00.959 align:start position:0%
done so I just want clarification I
 
00:12:02.509 --> 00:12:02.519 align:start position:0%
think what I heard you say this is the
 
00:12:04.870 --> 00:12:04.880 align:start position:0%
exact the wording is the exact same bill
 
00:12:07.710 --> 00:12:07.720 align:start position:0%
that we had a year ago nothing's changed
 
00:12:10.350 --> 00:12:10.360 align:start position:0%
in it is that we correct we amended it
 
00:12:13.629 --> 00:12:13.639 align:start position:0%
in committee a year ago that is this
 
00:12:15.790 --> 00:12:15.800 align:start position:0%
this exact same bill that bill then went
 
00:12:18.430 --> 00:12:18.440 align:start position:0%
to criminal justice and was unanimous uh
 
00:12:20.430 --> 00:12:20.440 align:start position:0%
and on consent calendar thank you that's
 
00:12:21.550 --> 00:12:21.560 align:start position:0%
what I thought I heard you say just
 
00:12:24.189 --> 00:12:24.199 align:start position:0%
wanted to be clear it is not identical
 
00:12:25.790 --> 00:12:25.800 align:start position:0%
to the first iteration of the bill which
 
00:12:27.870 --> 00:12:27.880 align:start position:0%
was by a different
 
00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:29.389 align:start position:0%
was by a different
representative

00:12:29.389 --> 00:12:29.399 align:start position:0%

529 as as drafted uh based on our
 
00:14:06.710 --> 00:14:06.720 align:start position:0%
concern that in particular or looking at
 
00:14:09.150 --> 00:14:09.160 align:start position:0%
section 1B of the bill is is where our
 
00:14:13.230 --> 00:14:13.240 align:start position:0%
concern is and if you read it as
 
00:14:16.189 --> 00:14:16.199 align:start position:0%
negligently mutilates or causes to be
 
00:14:18.389 --> 00:14:18.399 align:start position:0%

00:14:21.030 --> 00:14:21.040 align:start position:0%
negligently mutilates or causes to be
 
00:14:26.069 --> 00:14:26.079 align:start position:0%

00:14:48.269 --> 00:14:48.279 align:start position:0%
as again as drafted is is not is not
 
00:14:51.509 --> 00:14:51.519 align:start position:0%
clear and we would we ask the committee
 
00:14:53.629 --> 00:14:53.639 align:start position:0%
that before moving forward to please
 
00:14:57.670 --> 00:14:57.680 align:start position:0%
take a close look at it with that lens

Mr
 
00:15:56.670 --> 00:15:56.680 align:start position:0%
Oran oh thank thank you much Mr chair um
 
00:16:00.389 --> 00:16:00.399 align:start position:0%
I I was a sponsor of one of the earlier
 
00:16:02.430 --> 00:16:02.440 align:start position:0%
bills directed this topic so I think
 
00:16:05.230 --> 00:16:05.240 align:start position:0%
this is a very U this is a
 
00:16:07.990 --> 00:16:08.000 align:start position:0%
very very simple and workable approach
 
00:16:11.350 --> 00:16:11.360 align:start position:0%
the um there is a um of course I think
 
00:16:13.389 --> 00:16:13.399 align:start position:0%
those in the committee probably all know
 
00:16:15.030 --> 00:16:15.040 align:start position:0%
this but just for the sake of others
 
00:16:17.629 --> 00:16:17.639 align:start position:0%
listening in there are very clear and
 
00:16:19.430 --> 00:16:19.440 align:start position:0%
simple and long-established definitions
 
00:16:23.509 --> 00:16:23.519 align:start position:0%
for what is is a wild animal what is a u
 
00:16:26.150 --> 00:16:26.160 align:start position:0%
fish and what is a wild bird um
 
00:16:29.309 --> 00:16:29.319 align:start position:0%
situation the Farm Bureau man from the
 
00:16:32.069 --> 00:16:32.079 align:start position:0%
farm build Mr Johnson talked about um
 
00:16:35.110 --> 00:16:35.120 align:start position:0%
that is true I've uh I grew up in a
 
00:16:37.870 --> 00:16:37.880 align:start position:0%
rural rural part of town so I've U I've
 
00:16:40.110 --> 00:16:40.120 align:start position:0%
certainly seen um animals running when
 
00:16:41.749 --> 00:16:41.759 align:start position:0%
they hay the field and stuff I think
 
00:16:44.629 --> 00:16:44.639 align:start position:0%
that's um if you do that um that
 
00:16:46.629 --> 00:16:46.639 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be negligent if it's within the
 
00:16:49.590 --> 00:16:49.600 align:start position:0%
context of normal agriculture or normal
 
00:16:52.629 --> 00:16:52.639 align:start position:0%
animal husbandry practices and also I
 
00:16:55.110 --> 00:16:55.120 align:start position:0%
think that could already theoretically
 
00:16:58.790 --> 00:16:58.800 align:start position:0%
be a violation because um this is 209
 
00:17:03.509 --> 00:17:03.519 align:start position:0%
these this 2019 um D comes after two um
 
00:17:07.309 --> 00:17:07.319 align:start position:0%
20 RSA 20619 which uh allows the fish
 
00:17:10.789 --> 00:17:10.799 align:start position:0%
and game department to charge you with a
 
00:17:12.150 --> 00:17:12.160 align:start position:0%
a misdemeanor I'm sorry I said a
 
00:17:14.189 --> 00:17:14.199 align:start position:0%
violation a misdemeanor for like any
 
00:17:17.669 --> 00:17:17.679 align:start position:0%
violation fishing game rules and U so
 
00:17:21.189 --> 00:17:21.199 align:start position:0%
that's uh that's a problem which uh
 
00:17:22.949 --> 00:17:22.959 align:start position:0%
that's a problem which I think first of
 
00:17:24.870 --> 00:17:24.880 align:start position:0%
all I think it's not a real Pro not a
 
00:17:27.110 --> 00:17:27.120 align:start position:0%
real problem and if so it already that's
 
00:17:28.990 --> 00:17:29.000 align:start position:0%
something which is already illegal in
 
00:17:30.310 --> 00:17:30.320 align:start position:0%
the law and can be subject to
 
00:17:32.950 --> 00:17:32.960 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor penalties already so u i
 
00:17:35.990 --> 00:17:36.000 align:start position:0%
mean so I think this is a very very
 
00:17:37.710 --> 00:17:37.720 align:start position:0%
simple bill it's uh certainly much
 
00:17:39.230 --> 00:17:39.240 align:start position:0%
better than the one that I was a prime
 
00:17:42.590 --> 00:17:42.600 align:start position:0%
sponsor of which went down in flames in
 
00:17:47.150 --> 00:17:47.160 align:start position:0%
2018 I believe but um so I think um
 
00:17:48.590 --> 00:17:48.600 align:start position:0%
probably I should have just stuck with
 
00:17:50.110 --> 00:17:50.120 align:start position:0%
what I said the gentle lady from New
 
00:17:52.110 --> 00:17:52.120 align:start position:0%
Market um I think said it made a very
 
00:17:55.110 --> 00:17:55.120 align:start position:0%
clear case I think as usual she said it
 
00:17:57.430 --> 00:17:57.440 align:start position:0%
all very strongly so um I think I think
 
00:17:58.990 --> 00:17:59.000 align:start position:0%
we should uh
 
00:18:00.549 --> 00:18:00.559 align:start position:0%
I think we I think the I recommend the
 
00:18:01.870 --> 00:18:01.880 align:start position:0%
committee passed the bill I recommend
 
00:18:03.669 --> 00:18:03.679 align:start position:0%
the Full House passed the bill and um
 
00:18:05.350 --> 00:18:05.360 align:start position:0%
hopefully we'll we'll send it on its way
 
00:18:07.590 --> 00:18:07.600 align:start position:0%
so um thank you very much i' be happy to
 
00:18:09.950 --> 00:18:09.960 align:start position:0%
answer any questions if anyone has
 
00:18:12.190 --> 00:18:12.200 align:start position:0%
any thank you representative Oregon or
 
00:18:14.230 --> 00:18:14.240 align:start position:0%
any questions for representative Oregon
 
00:18:14.240 --> 00:18:15.789 align:start position:0%
any questions for representative Oregon
representative

00:18:15.789 --> 00:18:15.799 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:18:18.590 --> 00:18:18.600 align:start position:0%
Smith hello my name is Jonathan Smith I
 
00:18:21.190 --> 00:18:21.200 align:start position:0%
represent Carol County District 5 yeah I
 
00:18:23.789 --> 00:18:23.799 align:start position:0%
have not necessarily a it's a broad
 
00:18:26.350 --> 00:18:26.360 align:start position:0%
question I'm going back to the other uh
 
00:18:29.310 --> 00:18:29.320 align:start position:0%
speaker just so I have Clarity on the
 
00:18:32.350 --> 00:18:32.360 align:start position:0%
issue if um a farmer is cutting his
 
00:18:35.510 --> 00:18:35.520 align:start position:0%
field doing hay brush cutting and he did
 
00:18:39.510 --> 00:18:39.520 align:start position:0%
hit a a fawn that was H up in a little
 
00:18:43.510 --> 00:18:43.520 align:start position:0%
you know patch of woods or tall grass or
 
00:18:47.070 --> 00:18:47.080 align:start position:0%
a a nest of ducks with you know eggs
 
00:18:49.149 --> 00:18:49.159 align:start position:0%
would this bill allow that fora to be
 
00:18:51.950 --> 00:18:51.960 align:start position:0%
charged that that I think is a
 
00:18:54.549 --> 00:18:54.559 align:start position:0%
clear if you would mind holding that
 
00:18:56.270 --> 00:18:56.280 align:start position:0%
question I'm going ask Colonel Jordan to
 
00:18:58.470 --> 00:18:58.480 align:start position:0%
testify in a minute to uh speak to that
 
00:19:00.070 --> 00:19:00.080 align:start position:0%
question sure I'm not sure
 
00:19:01.270 --> 00:19:01.280 align:start position:0%
representative Oregan is the right
 
00:19:04.190 --> 00:19:04.200 align:start position:0%
person thank you
 
00:19:06.830 --> 00:19:06.840 align:start position:0%
no Sor from the fact that it's only
 
00:19:09.909 --> 00:19:09.919 align:start position:0%
negligent contact or purposeful contact
 
00:19:12.590 --> 00:19:12.600 align:start position:0%
so that I don't know if a farmer doesn't
 
00:19:13.990 --> 00:19:14.000 align:start position:0%
know there's a f there that's neither
 
00:19:16.510 --> 00:19:16.520 align:start position:0%
negligent nor P purposeful in my my
 
00:19:20.270 --> 00:19:20.280 align:start position:0%
opinion and um know damaging Wildlife is
 
00:19:22.070 --> 00:19:22.080 align:start position:0%
already like a misdemeanor anyway under
 
00:19:23.669 --> 00:19:23.679 align:start position:0%
the existing law the way I read the law
 
00:19:26.029 --> 00:19:26.039 align:start position:0%
of course I'm I'm not a lawyer but
 
00:19:29.070 --> 00:19:29.080 align:start position:0%
that's my opinion thanks
 
00:19:31.630 --> 00:19:31.640 align:start position:0%
any further questions for representative
 
00:19:33.630 --> 00:19:33.640 align:start position:0%
Oregan there being none thank you
 
00:19:35.230 --> 00:19:35.240 align:start position:0%
representative Oregon Colonel Jordan
 
00:19:36.549 --> 00:19:36.559 align:start position:0%
would you mind stepping up to the mic
 
00:19:37.870 --> 00:19:37.880 align:start position:0%
over there and I think there's a red
 
00:19:39.549 --> 00:19:39.559 align:start position:0%
button you can hit and I'll put you on
 
00:19:44.149 --> 00:19:44.159 align:start position:0%
speaker um and introduce yourself and uh
 
00:19:45.909 --> 00:19:45.919 align:start position:0%
and particularly if you could answer the
 
00:19:47.950 --> 00:19:47.960 align:start position:0%
question around Agriculture and what
 
00:19:50.750 --> 00:19:50.760 align:start position:0%
happens if a farmer who's mowing hay
 
00:19:52.710 --> 00:19:52.720 align:start position:0%
runs over a fawn and how that's
 
00:19:54.789 --> 00:19:54.799 align:start position:0%
addressed thank you yes thank you and
 
00:19:57.149 --> 00:19:57.159 align:start position:0%
good morning Mr chairman welcome to see
 
00:19:58.470 --> 00:19:58.480 align:start position:0%
on the committee and all the members
 
00:20:00.110 --> 00:20:00.120 align:start position:0%
back be back even though it's a bit
 
00:20:03.750 --> 00:20:03.760 align:start position:0%
bizarre it's nice to see way back um so
 
00:20:05.710 --> 00:20:05.720 align:start position:0%
this is a good bill uh we worked very
 
00:20:08.110 --> 00:20:08.120 align:start position:0%
hard on it because as represent Reed had
 
00:20:10.909 --> 00:20:10.919 align:start position:0%
said last last year and we were pretty
 
00:20:12.470 --> 00:20:12.480 align:start position:0%
confident that it was gonna go through
 
00:20:13.870 --> 00:20:13.880 align:start position:0%
last year and I think it would have had
 
00:20:17.590 --> 00:20:17.600 align:start position:0%
this pmic not yet the Farm Bureau uh and
 
00:20:19.590 --> 00:20:19.600 align:start position:0%
so we when we crafted this we were very
 
00:20:22.830 --> 00:20:22.840 align:start position:0%
careful to taking concerns regarding
 
00:20:26.029 --> 00:20:26.039 align:start position:0%
accidental or or conduct without a
 
00:20:31.310 --> 00:20:31.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:33.549 --> 00:20:33.559 align:start position:0%
neg we were confident the way it's
 
00:20:35.830 --> 00:20:35.840 align:start position:0%
written today that it does that the farm
 
00:20:37.630 --> 00:20:37.640 align:start position:0%
buau as you can imagine I have a great
 
00:20:39.549 --> 00:20:39.559 align:start position:0%
deal of respect for because we would be
 
00:20:41.630 --> 00:20:41.640 align:start position:0%
out of business Fish game without the
 
00:20:43.870 --> 00:20:43.880 align:start position:0%
support of our farmers in the state so
 
00:20:45.669 --> 00:20:45.679 align:start position:0%
that was a good concern I had a long
 
00:20:47.110 --> 00:20:47.120 align:start position:0%
conversation with robob over the phone
 
00:20:49.549 --> 00:20:49.559 align:start position:0%
over this and I am confident that this
 
00:20:51.310 --> 00:20:51.320 align:start position:0%
bill would not affect that and I'm going
 
00:20:53.430 --> 00:20:53.440 align:start position:0%
to give you a couple of examples to
 
00:20:56.750 --> 00:20:56.760 align:start position:0%
support my position on that so just so
 
00:21:00.950 --> 00:21:00.960 align:start position:0%
you know um pawns are routinely hit
 
00:21:02.750 --> 00:21:02.760 align:start position:0%
accidentally in the fields when Farmers
 
00:21:04.710 --> 00:21:04.720 align:start position:0%
R their hang the reason that happens is
 
00:21:06.870 --> 00:21:06.880 align:start position:0%
because they're almost impossible to see
 
00:21:09.510 --> 00:21:09.520 align:start position:0%
this past summer representative PE sent
 
00:21:12.310 --> 00:21:12.320 align:start position:0%
me a picture uh one afternoon he and I
 
00:21:13.710 --> 00:21:13.720 align:start position:0%
friends he sent me a text message and
 
00:21:15.630 --> 00:21:15.640 align:start position:0%
showed me a year that I don't to this
 
00:21:17.990 --> 00:21:18.000 align:start position:0%
day know how he missed but he missed it
 
00:21:19.870 --> 00:21:19.880 align:start position:0%
and he literally almost had to pick it
 
00:21:22.070 --> 00:21:22.080 align:start position:0%
up to make it run he just won't run so
 
00:21:24.870 --> 00:21:24.880 align:start position:0%
it's very easy to do this is my point
 
00:21:27.470 --> 00:21:27.480 align:start position:0%
and typically farmers will do this they
 
00:21:30.470 --> 00:21:30.480 align:start position:0%
will um on in most occasions on most
 
00:21:32.430 --> 00:21:32.440 align:start position:0%
occasions they will end the suffering of
 
00:21:35.390 --> 00:21:35.400 align:start position:0%
the animal which I would encourage uh in
 
00:21:38.390 --> 00:21:38.400 align:start position:0%
a farm uh situation that usually safe to
 
00:21:40.310 --> 00:21:40.320 align:start position:0%
do that and then they in fact contact us
 
00:21:42.310 --> 00:21:42.320 align:start position:0%
they're very good about the farmers are
 
00:21:43.870 --> 00:21:43.880 align:start position:0%
very good about that we keep track of
 
00:21:46.789 --> 00:21:46.799 align:start position:0%
this we had good experience with that so
 
00:21:49.510 --> 00:21:49.520 align:start position:0%
the concern was that this bill in in the
 
00:21:52.110 --> 00:21:52.120 align:start position:0%
wrong hands could then be used to go
 
00:21:54.269 --> 00:21:54.279 align:start position:0%
after Farmers because they should know
 
00:21:57.190 --> 00:21:57.200 align:start position:0%
that bonds are in the field uh in the
 
00:21:58.990 --> 00:21:59.000 align:start position:0%
spring of the year M I guess I would use
 
00:22:01.310 --> 00:22:01.320 align:start position:0%
the example of what we all put up with
 
00:22:03.110 --> 00:22:03.120 align:start position:0%
on our highways so as you drive the
 
00:22:05.710 --> 00:22:05.720 align:start position:0%
highways of New Hampshire you have a
 
00:22:07.269 --> 00:22:07.279 align:start position:0%
very good opportunity to run over a deer
 
00:22:08.950 --> 00:22:08.960 align:start position:0%
or moose at any given moment in fact
 
00:22:10.990 --> 00:22:11.000 align:start position:0%
there are places that we have been we
 
00:22:13.669 --> 00:22:13.679 align:start position:0%
have posted signs telling you you should
 
00:22:17.269 --> 00:22:17.279 align:start position:0%
expect there are in fact deer crossing
 
00:22:19.590 --> 00:22:19.600 align:start position:0%
here and yet we all including myself
 
00:22:21.310 --> 00:22:21.320 align:start position:0%
continue to go up the highway at at the
 
00:22:22.990 --> 00:22:23.000 align:start position:0%
speed limit and if you unfortunately hit
 
00:22:25.870 --> 00:22:25.880 align:start position:0%
a deer you could make the same argument
 
00:22:27.350 --> 00:22:27.360 align:start position:0%
that the farmers are concerned about
 
00:22:30.269 --> 00:22:30.279 align:start position:0%
these days so I can tell you from good
 
00:22:31.830 --> 00:22:31.840 align:start position:0%
experience of over two decades in the
 
00:22:33.669 --> 00:22:33.679 align:start position:0%
courtroom a judge is going to throw that
 
00:22:38.110 --> 00:22:38.120 align:start position:0%
out it's an accidental cause uh it's
 
00:22:41.110 --> 00:22:41.120 align:start position:0%
some we call an act of God I liken it to
 
00:22:43.430 --> 00:22:43.440 align:start position:0%
being on the road the same exact
 
00:22:44.990 --> 00:22:45.000 align:start position:0%
scenario could happen on the road when
 
00:22:47.110 --> 00:22:47.120 align:start position:0%
you see a sign that tells you that
 
00:22:48.789 --> 00:22:48.799 align:start position:0%
there's deer crossing and you continue
 
00:22:50.230 --> 00:22:50.240 align:start position:0%
on that you know it's a heads up to
 
00:22:51.789 --> 00:22:51.799 align:start position:0%
watch for it but everybody continues to
 
00:22:54.630 --> 00:22:54.640 align:start position:0%
spe liit if you hit a deer no absolutely
 
00:22:56.430 --> 00:22:56.440 align:start position:0%
not that is not going to rise to this
 
00:22:58.830 --> 00:22:58.840 align:start position:0%
level the other thing I that I would I
 
00:23:02.789 --> 00:23:02.799 align:start position:0%
would assure the farmers negligence is a
 
00:23:07.230 --> 00:23:07.240 align:start position:0%
u it is a scary term I think and defined
 
00:23:08.630 --> 00:23:08.640 align:start position:0%
in our
 
00:23:12.269 --> 00:23:12.279 align:start position:0%
legal laws in the state but I think they
 
00:23:14.269 --> 00:23:14.279 align:start position:0%
they the legislators of the time put
 
00:23:16.230 --> 00:23:16.240 align:start position:0%
some careful thought into it one one
 
00:23:18.430 --> 00:23:18.440 align:start position:0%
sentence in that negligent statute that
 
00:23:20.950 --> 00:23:20.960 align:start position:0%
I'm very happy about is it's got to be a
 
00:23:23.269 --> 00:23:23.279 align:start position:0%
in order to prove negligent got to be a
 
00:23:26.870 --> 00:23:26.880 align:start position:0%
gross deviation from normal
 
00:23:26.880 --> 00:23:28.470 align:start position:0%
gross deviation from normal
condu

00:23:28.470 --> 00:23:28.480 align:start position:0%
condu
 
00:23:30.710 --> 00:23:30.720 align:start position:0%
a gross deviation from normal conduct
 
00:23:32.990 --> 00:23:33.000 align:start position:0%
now I would call a gross deviation from
 
00:23:35.149 --> 00:23:35.159 align:start position:0%
normal conduct someone driving out into
 
00:23:38.190 --> 00:23:38.200 align:start position:0%
a field and running a deer purposely
 
00:23:40.190 --> 00:23:40.200 align:start position:0%
that's a gross deviation someone driving
 
00:23:41.630 --> 00:23:41.640 align:start position:0%
down the road and a deer jumps out in
 
00:23:44.029 --> 00:23:44.039 align:start position:0%
front of them or a veiler going to a a
 
00:23:46.149 --> 00:23:46.159 align:start position:0%
ha field a farmer trying to cut field
 
00:23:48.590 --> 00:23:48.600 align:start position:0%
and a and a and a dough puts her on in
 
00:23:50.630 --> 00:23:50.640 align:start position:0%
the path of that veiler that is not a
 
00:23:52.269 --> 00:23:52.279 align:start position:0%
gross deviation that's a farmer is
 
00:23:54.149 --> 00:23:54.159 align:start position:0%
trying to do his job that's a person
 
00:23:56.549 --> 00:23:56.559 align:start position:0%
driving down the road with no intent of
 
00:23:59.110 --> 00:23:59.120 align:start position:0%
hurting this animal so I don't feel I'm
 
00:24:00.990 --> 00:24:01.000 align:start position:0%
very confident when I tell you I do not
 
00:24:02.950 --> 00:24:02.960 align:start position:0%
feel that that could be used against a
 
00:24:05.470 --> 00:24:05.480 align:start position:0%
farmer or anyone on the hway if in fact
 
00:24:06.830 --> 00:24:06.840 align:start position:0%
it's every used against the farmer we're
 
00:24:07.990 --> 00:24:08.000 align:start position:0%
going to have a lot of people driving
 
00:24:09.710 --> 00:24:09.720 align:start position:0%
cars and courtrooms charged with the
 
00:24:11.830 --> 00:24:11.840 align:start position:0%
statute every time they get because the
 
00:24:14.430 --> 00:24:14.440 align:start position:0%
same scenari happening on our road so
 
00:24:16.070 --> 00:24:16.080 align:start position:0%
I'm confident that the Farm Bureau will
 
00:24:18.430 --> 00:24:18.440 align:start position:0%
be fine I'm confident that this is well
 
00:24:20.549 --> 00:24:20.559 align:start position:0%
crafted and will protect those things
 
00:24:22.230 --> 00:24:22.240 align:start position:0%
and it will also give us a tool we'
 
00:24:24.750 --> 00:24:24.760 align:start position:0%
never had uh to go after gross
 
00:24:27.110 --> 00:24:27.120 align:start position:0%
deviations of combat when we when we in
 
00:24:30.669 --> 00:24:30.679 align:start position:0%
fact see that so that that would be my
 
00:24:33.470 --> 00:24:33.480 align:start position:0%
response thank you Kurt Jordan is there
 
00:24:35.389 --> 00:24:35.399 align:start position:0%
questions we'll start in the room first
 
00:24:35.399 --> 00:24:36.510 align:start position:0%
questions we'll start in the room first
representative

00:24:36.510 --> 00:24:36.520 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:24:39.710 --> 00:24:39.720 align:start position:0%
Howard thank you Mr chairman thanks for
 
00:24:45.190 --> 00:24:45.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:48.750 --> 00:24:48.760 align:start position:0%
question is it on now yes okay thank you
 
00:24:51.870 --> 00:24:51.880 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman thank you Mr Gordon Tak my
 
00:24:55.590 --> 00:24:55.600 align:start position:0%
question um talking about the road
 
00:24:57.750 --> 00:24:57.760 align:start position:0%
situation uh I know I've driven down
 
00:24:59.510 --> 00:24:59.520 align:start position:0%
down the road and tried to avoid a
 
00:25:01.909 --> 00:25:01.919 align:start position:0%
squirrel and run it over
 
00:25:04.909 --> 00:25:04.919 align:start position:0%
anyways uh so someone behind me might
 
00:25:06.590 --> 00:25:06.600 align:start position:0%
say well he was trying to hit the
 
00:25:08.950 --> 00:25:08.960 align:start position:0%
squirrel how's that play out in this
 
00:25:12.549 --> 00:25:12.559 align:start position:0%
scenario well it's a very hard knowingly
 
00:25:14.830 --> 00:25:14.840 align:start position:0%
and purposely is a very hard element to
 
00:25:16.389 --> 00:25:16.399 align:start position:0%
prove that's why you don't see a lot of
 
00:25:18.909 --> 00:25:18.919 align:start position:0%
that in in a lot of our major crimes in
 
00:25:20.590 --> 00:25:20.600 align:start position:0%
the state because it's a very high level
 
00:25:23.870 --> 00:25:23.880 align:start position:0%
of proof so again I would I would tell
 
00:25:26.430 --> 00:25:26.440 align:start position:0%
you that that's an accident uh you you
 
00:25:28.070 --> 00:25:28.080 align:start position:0%
didn't go out the intend to run every
 
00:25:29.669 --> 00:25:29.679 align:start position:0%
great squirrel that you find you're
 
00:25:31.190 --> 00:25:31.200 align:start position:0%
you're driving a car down the highway
 
00:25:33.230 --> 00:25:33.240 align:start position:0%
like we all are these animals are coming
 
00:25:36.669 --> 00:25:36.679 align:start position:0%
out on their own um as long as you now I
 
00:25:38.070 --> 00:25:38.080 align:start position:0%
think the difference might be
 
00:25:40.310 --> 00:25:40.320 align:start position:0%
representative Howard I one thing just
 
00:25:42.029 --> 00:25:42.039 align:start position:0%
came to my mind was an individual we
 
00:25:45.070 --> 00:25:45.080 align:start position:0%
made a case on who purposely drove
 
00:25:47.389 --> 00:25:47.399 align:start position:0%
through a flock of turkeys with the
 
00:25:50.269 --> 00:25:50.279 align:start position:0%
intent on killing them so what he did
 
00:25:52.070 --> 00:25:52.080 align:start position:0%
was he stopped he allowed all the birds
 
00:25:53.389 --> 00:25:53.399 align:start position:0%
to collect in the road he was waiting
 
00:25:56.230 --> 00:25:56.240 align:start position:0%
for them to cross to witness to this he
 
00:25:57.870 --> 00:25:57.880 align:start position:0%
he decided he was not going to wait wait
 
00:26:00.149 --> 00:26:00.159 align:start position:0%
any longer and thr the car and drove
 
00:26:02.149 --> 00:26:02.159 align:start position:0%
through the now that is a gross
 
00:26:05.029 --> 00:26:05.039 align:start position:0%
deviation of normal behavior and and
 
00:26:06.710 --> 00:26:06.720 align:start position:0%
that would be a crime I could use this
 
00:26:09.029 --> 00:26:09.039 align:start position:0%
statute charger but if you're in fact
 
00:26:10.269 --> 00:26:10.279 align:start position:0%
driving down the road and doing your
 
00:26:12.230 --> 00:26:12.240 align:start position:0%
best to try and miss this thing or you
 
00:26:15.310 --> 00:26:15.320 align:start position:0%
determine as a driver that it's unsafe
 
00:26:18.470 --> 00:26:18.480 align:start position:0%
with SW or it take a step to avoid it
 
00:26:23.549 --> 00:26:23.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:25.389 --> 00:26:25.399 align:start position:0%
charging thank
 
00:26:34.269 --> 00:26:34.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:36.669 --> 00:26:36.679 align:start position:0%
Spain thank you Colonel for taking my
 
00:26:40.470 --> 00:26:40.480 align:start position:0%
question um we had some conversations uh
 
00:26:42.149 --> 00:26:42.159 align:start position:0%
Paul Sanderson and myself about this
 
00:26:44.190 --> 00:26:44.200 align:start position:0%
same exact issue about a week and a half
 
00:26:45.549 --> 00:26:45.559 align:start position:0%
ago because it was brought to my
 
00:26:47.029 --> 00:26:47.039 align:start position:0%
attention by some members of The Farm
 
00:26:49.430 --> 00:26:49.440 align:start position:0%
Bureau as well and it occurred to me at
 
00:26:51.990 --> 00:26:52.000 align:start position:0%
the time well this would also extend to
 
00:26:53.830 --> 00:26:53.840 align:start position:0%
people driving on the road because I had
 
00:26:55.590 --> 00:26:55.600 align:start position:0%
only been thinking about this bill and I
 
00:26:57.230 --> 00:26:57.240 align:start position:0%
did co-sponsor it but I've been was
 
00:26:58.549 --> 00:26:58.559 align:start position:0%
thinking about still in terms of the
 
00:27:00.029 --> 00:27:00.039 align:start position:0%
hunters and protecting the hunters and
 
00:27:00.039 --> 00:27:00.950 align:start position:0%
hunters and protecting the hunters and
hunting

00:27:00.950 --> 00:27:00.960 align:start position:0%
hunting
 
00:27:02.909 --> 00:27:02.919 align:start position:0%
activities um I felt we were pretty
 
00:27:04.870 --> 00:27:04.880 align:start position:0%
tight with that the question that came
 
00:27:07.190 --> 00:27:07.200 align:start position:0%
up um not so much at the time when we
 
00:27:10.549 --> 00:27:10.559 align:start position:0%
were discussing it didn't surround the
 
00:27:12.710 --> 00:27:12.720 align:start position:0%
act of the initial hitting of the animal
 
00:27:14.710 --> 00:27:14.720 align:start position:0%
with the farm equipment it had to do
 
00:27:16.269 --> 00:27:16.279 align:start position:0%
with the dispatching of that animal
 
00:27:18.230 --> 00:27:18.240 align:start position:0%
afterwards and as you know not every
 
00:27:20.269 --> 00:27:20.279 align:start position:0%
farmer carries a gun in their tractor
 
00:27:22.389 --> 00:27:22.399 align:start position:0%
while they're out there doing their work
 
00:27:24.909 --> 00:27:24.919 align:start position:0%
if the only object at hand nor nor does
 
00:27:26.549 --> 00:27:26.559 align:start position:0%
every driver carry a gun with them in
 
00:27:28.870 --> 00:27:28.880 align:start position:0%
the car if the only object at hand to
 
00:27:30.430 --> 00:27:30.440 align:start position:0%
end the suffering of the animal happens
 
00:27:33.149 --> 00:27:33.159 align:start position:0%
to be a tire iron or a wrench and the
 
00:27:36.230 --> 00:27:36.240 align:start position:0%
person puts that animal out of its
 
00:27:39.310 --> 00:27:39.320 align:start position:0%
suffering would this case be
 
00:27:42.269 --> 00:27:42.279 align:start position:0%
then uh brought against them for beating
 
00:27:44.750 --> 00:27:44.760 align:start position:0%
the animal and I contend no because
 
00:27:47.389 --> 00:27:47.399 align:start position:0%
you're ending the suffering not causing
 
00:27:50.310 --> 00:27:50.320 align:start position:0%
intentional suffering and extending it
 
00:27:52.070 --> 00:27:52.080 align:start position:0%
and I wanted to hear from you how you
 
00:27:54.830 --> 00:27:54.840 align:start position:0%
would treat that you're correct so we
 
00:27:57.950 --> 00:27:57.960 align:start position:0%
struggle with this because um we get
 
00:28:01.470 --> 00:28:01.480 align:start position:0%
calls from um farmers and others on I'll
 
00:28:03.590 --> 00:28:03.600 align:start position:0%
get a call from a Frank motor vehicle
 
00:28:05.070 --> 00:28:05.080 align:start position:0%
driver on the side of the road and they
 
00:28:07.430 --> 00:28:07.440 align:start position:0%
have a gear who was who was crying out
 
00:28:10.230 --> 00:28:10.240 align:start position:0%
because it's got a broken him and people
 
00:28:11.990 --> 00:28:12.000 align:start position:0%
want to dispatch that we struggle with
 
00:28:14.669 --> 00:28:14.679 align:start position:0%
that decision because I it's not always
 
00:28:16.870 --> 00:28:16.880 align:start position:0%
great thing people do it I might get
 
00:28:19.669 --> 00:28:19.679 align:start position:0%
away with that in Pittsburgh telling put
 
00:28:23.310 --> 00:28:23.320 align:start position:0%
the down you in nashille that might be a
 
00:28:26.470 --> 00:28:26.480 align:start position:0%
problem so um we hope that people will
 
00:28:28.830 --> 00:28:28.840 align:start position:0%
use common sense and how they do it but
 
00:28:32.110 --> 00:28:32.120 align:start position:0%
again I'm I agree if they are ending the
 
00:28:34.950 --> 00:28:34.960 align:start position:0%
Suffering The goal of this is to end the
 
00:28:38.789 --> 00:28:38.799 align:start position:0%
suffering um then they're not that's not
 
00:28:42.389 --> 00:28:42.399 align:start position:0%
aor negligent part of so you have to
 
00:28:44.710 --> 00:28:44.720 align:start position:0%
prove this statute these types of
 
00:28:47.549 --> 00:28:47.559 align:start position:0%
statutes require that you prove every
 
00:28:49.590 --> 00:28:49.600 align:start position:0%
element of the offense that's a high
 
00:28:51.909 --> 00:28:51.919 align:start position:0%
standard of proof you've almost the only
 
00:28:53.750 --> 00:28:53.760 align:start position:0%
the only way I can see this statute
 
00:28:56.630 --> 00:28:56.640 align:start position:0%
being used is if you get and I'll use
 
00:28:58.549 --> 00:28:58.559 align:start position:0%
the horrible example of the young
 
00:29:01.789 --> 00:29:01.799 align:start position:0%
students up in Bart who who set out to
 
00:29:03.870 --> 00:29:03.880 align:start position:0%
beat these ducks they beat them with
 
00:29:05.509 --> 00:29:05.519 align:start position:0%
broomsticks for no other reason than
 
00:29:07.430 --> 00:29:07.440 align:start position:0%
they were that was their
 
00:29:12.070 --> 00:29:12.080 align:start position:0%
idea that fits this absolutely fit the
 
00:29:14.509 --> 00:29:14.519 align:start position:0%
young man who stepped in in that
 
00:29:17.389 --> 00:29:17.399 align:start position:0%
scenario and put the final suffering
 
00:29:21.350 --> 00:29:21.360 align:start position:0%
duck down he took a step with no tools
 
00:29:23.509 --> 00:29:23.519 align:start position:0%
to end the suffering of that last gun he
 
00:29:25.750 --> 00:29:25.760 align:start position:0%
does not need that stand clear he was
 
00:29:27.110 --> 00:29:27.120 align:start position:0%
trying to do the right thing with what
 
00:29:27.120 --> 00:29:27.830 align:start position:0%
trying to do the right thing with what
he

00:29:27.830 --> 00:29:27.840 align:start position:0%
he
 
00:29:29.909 --> 00:29:29.919 align:start position:0%
and in your scenario I I think that's
 
00:29:31.750 --> 00:29:31.760 align:start position:0%
what people try to do we don't recommend
 
00:29:40.070 --> 00:29:40.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:43.750 --> 00:29:43.760 align:start position:0%
IES doesn't
 
00:29:46.430 --> 00:29:46.440 align:start position:0%
that's thank you Colonel appreciate that
 
00:29:50.389 --> 00:29:50.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:53.149 --> 00:29:53.159 align:start position:0%
Jordan there being none our previous
 
00:29:56.430 --> 00:29:56.440 align:start position:0%
speaker we were looking for Miss H bbau

Zoom so my first time uh thank you very
 
00:30:17.149 --> 00:30:17.159 align:start position:0%
much for um for taking my testimony my
 
00:30:19.070 --> 00:30:19.080 align:start position:0%
name is Joanne borbo I'm the
 
00:30:20.830 --> 00:30:20.840 align:start position:0%
northeastern Regional director for the
 
00:30:23.870 --> 00:30:23.880 align:start position:0%
Humane Society of the US and uh we
 
00:30:28.070 --> 00:30:28.080 align:start position:0%
support this bill very strongly um we
 
00:30:32.389 --> 00:30:32.399 align:start position:0%
wild animals um unfortunately are not uh
 
00:30:34.230 --> 00:30:34.240 align:start position:0%
immune from these senseless accidental
 
00:30:36.470 --> 00:30:36.480 align:start position:0%
cruelty in new or anywhere in the
 
00:30:39.269 --> 00:30:39.279 align:start position:0%
country um you know we see many cases
 
00:30:43.269 --> 00:30:43.279 align:start position:0%
like this and um New Hampshire has has
 
00:30:45.630 --> 00:30:45.640 align:start position:0%
has done the right thing by uh domestic
 
00:30:48.750 --> 00:30:48.760 align:start position:0%
animals and captive wildlife and we feel
 
00:30:51.430 --> 00:30:51.440 align:start position:0%
this is just a really um simple way to
 
00:30:53.990 --> 00:30:54.000 align:start position:0%
close the gap and loophole just for for
 
00:30:56.509 --> 00:30:56.519 align:start position:0%
Native wildlife and it it shouldn't be
 
00:30:59.470 --> 00:30:59.480 align:start position:0%
the you know who the victim is um it's
 
00:31:02.110 --> 00:31:02.120 align:start position:0%
really the act itself that is uh that is
 
00:31:04.590 --> 00:31:04.600 align:start position:0%
the issue here um you know we we don't
 
00:31:07.310 --> 00:31:07.320 align:start position:0%
see biological ecological or ethical
 
00:31:09.149 --> 00:31:09.159 align:start position:0%
justication for excluding wild animals
 
00:31:11.710 --> 00:31:11.720 align:start position:0%
from uh from these protections and are
 
00:31:14.590 --> 00:31:14.600 align:start position:0%
very happy to be on the same side with
 
00:31:15.750 --> 00:31:15.760 align:start position:0%
the Fish and Game Commission and
 
00:31:18.269 --> 00:31:18.279 align:start position:0%
supporting this bill um representative
 
00:31:20.629 --> 00:31:20.639 align:start position:0%
Reed put it very uh beautifully earlier
 
00:31:23.549 --> 00:31:23.559 align:start position:0%
on um the link between animal cruelty
 
00:31:26.669 --> 00:31:26.679 align:start position:0%
and violence um is another reason why we
 
00:31:28.590 --> 00:31:28.600 align:start position:0%
support this spell and and cruelty to
 
00:31:30.190 --> 00:31:30.200 align:start position:0%
animals is is one of the biggest
 
00:31:33.310 --> 00:31:33.320 align:start position:0%
predictors of future violent behavior um
 
00:31:34.710 --> 00:31:34.720 align:start position:0%
so we definitely want to make sure that
 
00:31:36.830 --> 00:31:36.840 align:start position:0%
we're able to intervene soon uh when
 
00:31:38.950 --> 00:31:38.960 align:start position:0%
these cases happen especially involving
 
00:31:42.269 --> 00:31:42.279 align:start position:0%
uh kids um and and hopefully Point them
 
00:31:44.190 --> 00:31:44.200 align:start position:0%
in in the right direction and more more
 
00:31:47.909 --> 00:31:47.919 align:start position:0%

00:31:50.149 --> 00:31:50.159 align:start position:0%
committee my testimony along with some
 
00:31:52.549 --> 00:31:52.559 align:start position:0%
uh few uh further research on the link
 
00:31:53.870 --> 00:31:53.880 align:start position:0%
between animal cruelty and human
 
00:31:56.269 --> 00:31:56.279 align:start position:0%
violence so I won't uh take up any more
 
00:31:58.509 --> 00:31:58.519 align:start position:0%
of your time um but I want to thank the

support of HB 529 FN I wanted to speak a
 
00:32:54.190 --> 00:32:54.200 align:start position:0%
little bit um to clarify in what
 
00:32:56.389 --> 00:32:56.399 align:start position:0%
existing law is and go over some animal
 
00:33:00.669 --> 00:33:00.679 align:start position:0%
cruelty cases is um it this bill does
 
00:33:03.310 --> 00:33:03.320 align:start position:0%
indeed Rectify a loophole um that is an
 
00:33:04.590 --> 00:33:04.600 align:start position:0%
existing law
 
00:33:08.629 --> 00:33:08.639 align:start position:0%
currently um according to RSA
 
00:33:11.950 --> 00:33:11.960 align:start position:0%
212-b semicolon 2 New Hampshire is home
 
00:33:15.310 --> 00:33:15.320 align:start position:0%
to more than 420 species currently
 
00:33:19.789 --> 00:33:19.799 align:start position:0%
animal cruelty code RSA 644 semicolon 8
 
00:33:21.870 --> 00:33:21.880 align:start position:0%
does apply to domestic animals that
 
00:33:24.590 --> 00:33:24.600 align:start position:0%
being horses and livestock household
 
00:33:27.190 --> 00:33:27.200 align:start position:0%
pets which is dogs cats and ferrets and
 
00:33:29.070 --> 00:33:29.080 align:start position:0%
then wildlife in captivity which is
 
00:33:32.590 --> 00:33:32.600 align:start position:0%
wildlife in zoos and sanctuaries Etc um
 
00:33:35.430 --> 00:33:35.440 align:start position:0%
the endangered species conservation act
 
00:33:38.029 --> 00:33:38.039 align:start position:0%
safeguards 51 endangered or threatened
 
00:33:40.070 --> 00:33:40.080 align:start position:0%
species and the New Hampshire fishing
 
00:33:42.830 --> 00:33:42.840 align:start position:0%
game laws and rules um provide certain
 
00:33:45.990 --> 00:33:46.000 align:start position:0%
protection for 60 game species under
 
00:33:48.830 --> 00:33:48.840 align:start position:0%
hunting trapping and fishing Seasons um
 
00:33:50.990 --> 00:33:51.000 align:start position:0%
that does leave over 300 of New
 
00:33:52.789 --> 00:33:52.799 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's valued Wildlife species
 
00:33:54.830 --> 00:33:54.840 align:start position:0%
vulnerable to malicious beaing torture
 
00:33:57.110 --> 00:33:57.120 align:start position:0%
and mutilation under the law and and
 
00:33:59.389 --> 00:33:59.399 align:start position:0%
while those 60 game species are provided
 
00:34:01.310 --> 00:34:01.320 align:start position:0%
certain protections under season rules
 
00:34:04.190 --> 00:34:04.200 align:start position:0%
and regulations those protections are
 
00:34:07.069 --> 00:34:07.079 align:start position:0%
limited um for example in
 
00:34:10.069 --> 00:34:10.079 align:start position:0%
2017 a shark was brutally dragged behind
 
00:34:11.750 --> 00:34:11.760 align:start position:0%
a boat at high speeds by three
 
00:34:14.430 --> 00:34:14.440 align:start position:0%
individuals in Florida an image of that
 
00:34:15.990 --> 00:34:16.000 align:start position:0%
incident showed that the shark's body
 
00:34:18.790 --> 00:34:18.800 align:start position:0%
was almost completely torn in half all
 
00:34:20.190 --> 00:34:20.200 align:start position:0%
three individuals were charged with
 
00:34:22.349 --> 00:34:22.359 align:start position:0%
felony animal cruelty as the state of
 
00:34:24.310 --> 00:34:24.320 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire have laws that protect any
 
00:34:27.510 --> 00:34:27.520 align:start position:0%
animal and that includes native Wildlife
 
00:34:30.310 --> 00:34:30.320 align:start position:0%
whether endangered or not um when that
 
00:34:32.190 --> 00:34:32.200 align:start position:0%
case scenario was presented to the New
 
00:34:33.790 --> 00:34:33.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire fishing game not one
 
00:34:35.829 --> 00:34:35.839 align:start position:0%
individual could point to an applicable
 
00:34:37.990 --> 00:34:38.000 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire law meaning that there
 
00:34:40.750 --> 00:34:40.760 align:start position:0%
would have been no charges in that case
 
00:34:43.550 --> 00:34:43.560 align:start position:0%
um again um Colonel Jordan spoke to the
 
00:34:46.030 --> 00:34:46.040 align:start position:0%
kennet high school case in 2019
 
00:34:48.470 --> 00:34:48.480 align:start position:0%
involving the students from North Conway
 
00:34:50.389 --> 00:34:50.399 align:start position:0%
who lured a duck which is a regulated
 
00:34:53.109 --> 00:34:53.119 align:start position:0%
game species out of the water and
 
00:34:54.710 --> 00:34:54.720 align:start position:0%
severely beat that duck with a
 
00:34:56.869 --> 00:34:56.879 align:start position:0%
broomstick now while that case didn't
 
00:34:58.550 --> 00:34:58.560 align:start position:0%
involved juvenilis and was handled a
 
00:35:01.230 --> 00:35:01.240 align:start position:0%
little bit differently even if it hadn't
 
00:35:03.430 --> 00:35:03.440 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire fishing game confirmed
 
00:35:05.630 --> 00:35:05.640 align:start position:0%
the only applicable penalty was unlawful
 
00:35:07.910 --> 00:35:07.920 align:start position:0%
take and that is a violation under
 
00:35:09.710 --> 00:35:09.720 align:start position:0%
existing law that comes with the mayor
 
00:35:13.310 --> 00:35:13.320 align:start position:0%
monetary fine in contrast to that lack
 
00:35:15.950 --> 00:35:15.960 align:start position:0%
of ability to seek suitable prosecution
 
00:35:18.750 --> 00:35:18.760 align:start position:0%
for such a violent and malicious act in
 
00:35:21.270 --> 00:35:21.280 align:start position:0%
October of last year two men were
 
00:35:24.190 --> 00:35:24.200 align:start position:0%
charged with um allegedly beating
 
00:35:26.950 --> 00:35:26.960 align:start position:0%
several porcupines to death with a baton
 
00:35:29.670 --> 00:35:29.680 align:start position:0%
that was in Rockland Maine both of those
 
00:35:31.510 --> 00:35:31.520 align:start position:0%
individuals were charged with aggravated
 
00:35:31.520 --> 00:35:33.230 align:start position:0%
individuals were charged with aggravated
felony

00:35:33.230 --> 00:35:33.240 align:start position:0%
felony
 
00:35:35.589 --> 00:35:35.599 align:start position:0%
cruelty and now so while some may
 
00:35:37.910 --> 00:35:37.920 align:start position:0%
believe that we may have laws just
 
00:35:39.510 --> 00:35:39.520 align:start position:0%
because we don't have Wildlife cruelty
 
00:35:41.589 --> 00:35:41.599 align:start position:0%
laws in place um that we would be able
 
00:35:44.150 --> 00:35:44.160 align:start position:0%
to seek Justice um in these types of
 
00:35:46.790 --> 00:35:46.800 align:start position:0%
cases using existing law and regulations
 
00:35:48.829 --> 00:35:48.839 align:start position:0%
that we have but that's just not the
 
00:35:51.430 --> 00:35:51.440 align:start position:0%
case um and that's the case with no
 
00:35:53.710 --> 00:35:53.720 align:start position:0%
matter how valued these these species
 
00:35:56.309 --> 00:35:56.319 align:start position:0%
are including moose which only limited
 
00:35:58.190 --> 00:35:58.200 align:start position:0%
permits are issued a year for the
 
00:36:01.150 --> 00:36:01.160 align:start position:0%
hunting of those species um unlawful
 
00:36:03.670 --> 00:36:03.680 align:start position:0%
take of a moose is a violation unless
 
00:36:05.710 --> 00:36:05.720 align:start position:0%
conducted during a close season which is
 
00:36:07.309 --> 00:36:07.319 align:start position:0%
only a
 
00:36:09.550 --> 00:36:09.560 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor so the purposeful beating
 
00:36:11.750 --> 00:36:11.760 align:start position:0%
cruel whipping torture of or mutilation
 
00:36:16.190 --> 00:36:16.200 align:start position:0%
of a domestic animal um you know th
 
00:36:18.270 --> 00:36:18.280 align:start position:0%
those types of cruelties to captive
 
00:36:21.750 --> 00:36:21.760 align:start position:0%
wildlife in sanctuaries and zoos Etc
 
00:36:23.470 --> 00:36:23.480 align:start position:0%
that's a felony level offense under
 
00:36:25.990 --> 00:36:26.000 align:start position:0%
existing law there should be a specific
 
00:36:28.190 --> 00:36:28.200 align:start position:0%
law in place that illegalized such
 
00:36:29.990 --> 00:36:30.000 align:start position:0%
violence against free roaming Wildlife
 
00:36:31.829 --> 00:36:31.839 align:start position:0%
as well rather than that current
 
00:36:33.230 --> 00:36:33.240 align:start position:0%
requirement of searching for a
 
00:36:35.430 --> 00:36:35.440 align:start position:0%
coincidental applicable office suitable
 
00:36:37.750 --> 00:36:37.760 align:start position:0%
prosecution and those efforts which
 
00:36:40.030 --> 00:36:40.040 align:start position:0%
nearly are all you know nearly if not
 
00:36:41.990 --> 00:36:42.000 align:start position:0%
always feudal based on the limitations
 
00:36:43.950 --> 00:36:43.960 align:start position:0%
of EX of existing law and that includes
 
00:36:46.750 --> 00:36:46.760 align:start position:0%
game species in regards to the existing
 
00:36:48.750 --> 00:36:48.760 align:start position:0%
link between animal cruelty and human
 
00:36:51.750 --> 00:36:51.760 align:start position:0%
violence I'll speak to that briefly um
 
00:36:54.069 --> 00:36:54.079 align:start position:0%
the FBI did begin tracking cases
 
00:36:56.109 --> 00:36:56.119 align:start position:0%
nationally and categorizing them as a
 
00:36:57.950 --> 00:36:57.960 align:start position:0%
crime against Society in
 
00:37:00.349 --> 00:37:00.359 align:start position:0%
2016 research shows that there's a link
 
00:37:05.390 --> 00:37:05.400 align:start position:0%
between 47 and 99% of animal abusers
 
00:37:07.910 --> 00:37:07.920 align:start position:0%
have convictions for other crimes that
 
00:37:11.510 --> 00:37:11.520 align:start position:0%
includes sexual abuse homicide assault
 
00:37:14.750 --> 00:37:14.760 align:start position:0%
Firearms off uh offenses and
 
00:37:19.109 --> 00:37:19.119 align:start position:0%
arson and those and um animal
 
00:37:25.150 --> 00:37:25.160 align:start position:0%
cruelty um is uh is more uh highly to be
 
00:37:27.510 --> 00:37:27.520 align:start position:0%
a better predictor of sexual assault
 
00:37:29.790 --> 00:37:29.800 align:start position:0%
than other previous convictions such as
 
00:37:31.950 --> 00:37:31.960 align:start position:0%
homicide arson and Firearm
 
00:37:34.670 --> 00:37:34.680 align:start position:0%
offenses in regards to protecting Sports
 
00:37:36.309 --> 00:37:36.319 align:start position:0%
men and women I wanted to highlight
 
00:37:38.670 --> 00:37:38.680 align:start position:0%
again that exclusion that exists within
 
00:37:42.790 --> 00:37:42.800 align:start position:0%
HB 529 FN this law will be placed
 
00:37:45.670 --> 00:37:45.680 align:start position:0%
specifically in Title 18 and I wanted to
 
00:37:47.790 --> 00:37:47.800 align:start position:0%
highlight some laws that are within
 
00:37:51.109 --> 00:37:51.119 align:start position:0%
Title 18 and existing laws um that would
 
00:37:54.190 --> 00:37:54.200 align:start position:0%
be CL included in that exemption to
 
00:37:56.950 --> 00:37:56.960 align:start position:0%
protect families properties to domestic
 
00:38:00.150 --> 00:38:00.160 align:start position:0%
animals and crops RSA
 
00:38:04.030 --> 00:38:04.040 align:start position:0%
20726 which is in Title 18 that allows
 
00:38:07.589 --> 00:38:07.599 align:start position:0%
any person to pursue wound or kill on
 
00:38:10.750 --> 00:38:10.760 align:start position:0%
land owned or occupied by such person
 
00:38:13.790 --> 00:38:13.800 align:start position:0%
any unprotected bird or wild animal
 
00:38:15.309 --> 00:38:15.319 align:start position:0%
which the person finds in the act of
 
00:38:17.470 --> 00:38:17.480 align:start position:0%
doing actual and substantial damage to
 
00:38:19.630 --> 00:38:19.640 align:start position:0%
poultry crops domestic animals or a
 
00:38:19.640 --> 00:38:20.750 align:start position:0%
poultry crops domestic animals or a
person's

person's
 
00:38:23.190 --> 00:38:23.200 align:start position:0%
property and they may also authorize a
 
00:38:25.750 --> 00:38:25.760 align:start position:0%
family member employee or other person
 
00:38:28.670 --> 00:38:28.680 align:start position:0%
um requested to to do so under that law
 
00:38:31.550 --> 00:38:31.560 align:start position:0%
or um using a depredation permit issued
 
00:38:33.230 --> 00:38:33.240 align:start position:0%
by the executive director of Fish and
 
00:38:39.270 --> 00:38:39.280 align:start position:0%

their homes or upon their
 
00:39:13.790 --> 00:39:13.800 align:start position:0%
crops I wanted to speak really briefly
 
00:39:15.950 --> 00:39:15.960 align:start position:0%
in regards to culpability because I want
 
00:39:19.270 --> 00:39:19.280 align:start position:0%
to highlight that I do support the
 
00:39:23.030 --> 00:39:23.040 align:start position:0%
inclusion of the negligent um level of
 
00:39:25.150 --> 00:39:25.160 align:start position:0%
culpability for the misdemeanor and I'm
 
00:39:26.990 --> 00:39:27.000 align:start position:0%
I'm grateful that uh colonel Jordan was
 
00:39:29.190 --> 00:39:29.200 align:start position:0%
able to explain that for you in terms of
 
00:39:31.790 --> 00:39:31.800 align:start position:0%
if someone is intoxicated but I also
 
00:39:33.430 --> 00:39:33.440 align:start position:0%
wanted to highlight that in order for
 
00:39:36.270 --> 00:39:36.280 align:start position:0%
someone to be considered negligent um
 
00:39:41.270 --> 00:39:41.280 align:start position:0%
they have to um be unaware or fail to
 
00:39:45.630 --> 00:39:45.640 align:start position:0%
aware the risk of causing this type of
 
00:39:48.190 --> 00:39:48.200 align:start position:0%
Cruelty to the point where it's at such
 
00:39:51.190 --> 00:39:51.200 align:start position:0%
of Nature and a and a degree that their
 
00:39:53.829 --> 00:39:53.839 align:start position:0%
failure to become aware constitutes a
 
00:39:57.589 --> 00:39:57.599 align:start position:0%
gross deviation for the for the from the
 
00:40:00.069 --> 00:40:00.079 align:start position:0%
conduct that a reasonable person would
 
00:40:02.790 --> 00:40:02.800 align:start position:0%
in that situation so that means in those
 
00:40:04.270 --> 00:40:04.280 align:start position:0%
cases that you're discussing those
 
00:40:08.030 --> 00:40:08.040 align:start position:0%
accidents with agriculture or um a
 
00:40:10.829 --> 00:40:10.839 align:start position:0%
highwa situation that would have to be a
 
00:40:13.750 --> 00:40:13.760 align:start position:0%
deviation a gross deviation from what a
 
00:40:15.829 --> 00:40:15.839 align:start position:0%
reasonable person would do in those
 
00:40:17.910 --> 00:40:17.920 align:start position:0%
moments so when you talk about ending
 
00:40:19.990 --> 00:40:20.000 align:start position:0%
the suffering of an animal or you talk
 
00:40:21.829 --> 00:40:21.839 align:start position:0%
about someone accidentally hitting
 
00:40:24.230 --> 00:40:24.240 align:start position:0%
hitting an animal on the highway in my
 
00:40:26.470 --> 00:40:26.480 align:start position:0%
opinion in those situations based on
 
00:40:27.950 --> 00:40:27.960 align:start position:0%
what our laws of culpability are
 
00:40:30.630 --> 00:40:30.640 align:start position:0%
currently for even the negligent um
 
00:40:33.109 --> 00:40:33.119 align:start position:0%
level um that would not be applicable in
 
00:40:36.109 --> 00:40:36.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:38.510 --> 00:40:38.520 align:start position:0%
cases um and that and that is all uh
 
00:40:39.790 --> 00:40:39.800 align:start position:0%
thank you so much for your time I
 
00:40:39.800 --> 00:40:41.750 align:start position:0%
thank you so much for your time I

basically tells the U constituents that
 
00:43:08.910 --> 00:43:08.920 align:start position:0%
can't be changed by a adjustment to the
 
00:43:10.470 --> 00:43:10.480 align:start position:0%
administrative roles but it has to be
 
00:43:13.670 --> 00:43:13.680 align:start position:0%
done by a change thing and you should
 
00:43:15.710 --> 00:43:15.720 align:start position:0%
have a copy of both those

00:43:33.109 --> 00:43:33.119 align:start position:0%
calibers uh also provide original copy
 
00:43:36.030 --> 00:43:36.040 align:start position:0%
email and I just asked him if the chish
 
00:43:37.510 --> 00:43:37.520 align:start position:0%
game department had any questions or
 
00:43:40.390 --> 00:43:40.400 align:start position:0%
concerns that support this type of
 
00:43:44.470 --> 00:43:44.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:46.990 --> 00:43:47.000 align:start position:0%
legislation I never received response
 
00:43:50.510 --> 00:43:50.520 align:start position:0%
from Mr I'm unaware of what their
 
00:43:55.069 --> 00:43:55.079 align:start position:0%
position is all Mr mentioning
 
00:43:55.079 --> 00:43:57.349 align:start position:0%
position is all Mr mentioning
that

00:43:57.349 --> 00:43:57.359 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:43:57.359 --> 00:44:00.069 align:start position:0%
that
45

00:44:00.069 --> 00:44:00.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:03.589 --> 00:44:03.599 align:start position:0%
H and then I did some comparisons of how
 
00:44:06.230 --> 00:44:06.240 align:start position:0%
this passing of this Bild would affect
 
00:44:07.790 --> 00:44:07.800 align:start position:0%
other regulations on the law that I
 
00:44:10.840 --> 00:44:10.850 align:start position:0%
could find and have attached those in
 
00:44:10.850 --> 00:44:13.109 align:start position:0%
could find and have attached those in
[Music]

00:44:13.109 --> 00:44:13.119 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:44:15.430 --> 00:44:15.440 align:start position:0%
particular three which is the taking
 
00:44:17.510 --> 00:44:17.520 align:start position:0%
mode which list several different quite
 
00:44:18.349 --> 00:44:18.359 align:start position:0%
a few
 
00:44:18.359 --> 00:44:20.390 align:start position:0%
a few
communities

00:44:20.390 --> 00:44:20.400 align:start position:0%
communities
 
00:44:27.150 --> 00:44:27.160 align:start position:0%
Chang and 3A and 3B and wait
 
00:44:30.069 --> 00:44:30.079 align:start position:0%
3C uh in conclusion I want to thank the
 
00:44:31.230 --> 00:44:31.240 align:start position:0%
committee for the opportunity to speak
 
00:44:35.109 --> 00:44:35.119 align:start position:0%
to you folks available for any questions
 
00:44:38.670 --> 00:44:38.680 align:start position:0%
uh any technical questions uh Mr
 
00:44:43.270 --> 00:44:43.280 align:start position:0%
MCU I believe next you should
 
00:44:45.309 --> 00:44:45.319 align:start position:0%
be thank you representative any
 
00:44:47.069 --> 00:44:47.079 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
00:44:51.270 --> 00:44:51.280 align:start position:0%
McDonald representative Harvey so I just
 
00:44:53.270 --> 00:44:53.280 align:start position:0%
um am confused about one of your
 
00:44:55.309 --> 00:44:55.319 align:start position:0%
statements um did you say that this
 
00:44:59.109 --> 00:44:59.119 align:start position:0%
could is something that could not be um
 
00:45:02.390 --> 00:45:02.400 align:start position:0%
um changed in the rules and of New
 
00:45:04.829 --> 00:45:04.839 align:start position:0%
Hampshire fishing game and I I wonder
 
00:45:07.150 --> 00:45:07.160 align:start position:0%
why it could not be done that way I
 
00:45:09.750 --> 00:45:09.760 align:start position:0%
believe currently because it
 
00:45:09.760 --> 00:45:14.910 align:start position:0%
believe currently because it
exists

00:45:14.910 --> 00:45:14.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:18.589 --> 00:45:18.599 align:start position:0%
ands okay I get
 
00:45:21.150 --> 00:45:21.160 align:start position:0%
it any other questions for
 
00:45:21.160 --> 00:45:22.790 align:start position:0%
it any other questions for
representative

00:45:22.790 --> 00:45:22.800 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:45:24.950 --> 00:45:24.960 align:start position:0%
McDonald if you're online if you wave
 
00:45:26.710 --> 00:45:26.720 align:start position:0%
your hand I can see you
 
00:45:29.910 --> 00:45:29.920 align:start position:0%
representative llam go
 
00:45:32.990 --> 00:45:33.000 align:start position:0%
ahead thank you um this the
 
00:45:35.309 --> 00:45:35.319 align:start position:0%
representative llam and I have a
 
00:45:38.190 --> 00:45:38.200 align:start position:0%
question for the uh for the for the
 
00:45:43.030 --> 00:45:43.040 align:start position:0%
representative um my question I guess is
 
00:45:46.109 --> 00:45:46.119 align:start position:0%
why currently you're allowed five rounds
 
00:45:48.670 --> 00:45:48.680 align:start position:0%
and your bill uh provides to increase
 
00:45:51.309 --> 00:45:51.319 align:start position:0%
that to six rounds and I'm guessing
 
00:45:53.510 --> 00:45:53.520 align:start position:0%
that's because most of these hunting
 
00:45:56.349 --> 00:45:56.359 align:start position:0%
pistols would be revolvers um rather
 
00:45:58.349 --> 00:45:58.359 align:start position:0%
than like a semi-automatic just because
 
00:46:00.470 --> 00:46:00.480 align:start position:0%
you know you're gonna have like a six or
 
00:46:02.349 --> 00:46:02.359 align:start position:0%
eight inch barrel when you're hunting is
 
00:46:04.750 --> 00:46:04.760 align:start position:0%
it because of the revolvers why six
 
00:46:08.030 --> 00:46:08.040 align:start position:0%
instead of five because most of the deer
 
00:46:11.670 --> 00:46:11.680 align:start position:0%
hunting um guns uh only only allow you
 
00:46:14.230 --> 00:46:14.240 align:start position:0%
five rounds thank
 
00:46:16.950 --> 00:46:16.960 align:start position:0%
you uh that's what the constituent
 
00:46:20.630 --> 00:46:20.640 align:start position:0%
requested that we change his s u I'm a
 
00:46:20.640 --> 00:46:22.829 align:start position:0%
requested that we change his s u I'm a
Revol

00:46:22.829 --> 00:46:22.839 align:start position:0%
Revol
 
00:46:32.270 --> 00:46:32.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:34.950 --> 00:46:34.960 align:start position:0%
repres I am gonna have represent uh I am
 
00:46:36.309 --> 00:46:36.319 align:start position:0%
gonna ask Colonel Jordan to speak to
 
00:46:38.150 --> 00:46:38.160 align:start position:0%
that issue a little bit
 
00:46:41.870 --> 00:46:41.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:47.829 --> 00:46:47.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:49.670 --> 00:46:49.680 align:start position:0%
McDonald there being none thank you
 
00:46:51.230 --> 00:46:51.240 align:start position:0%
represent McDonald for your
 
00:46:54.670 --> 00:46:54.680 align:start position:0%
testimony next up is represent uh is
 
00:46:57.750 --> 00:46:57.760 align:start position:0%
William McDuff presenting himself Mr
 
00:47:00.910 --> 00:47:00.920 align:start position:0%
McDuff uh you are all set to go good
 
00:47:04.230 --> 00:47:04.240 align:start position:0%
morning can you hear me yes we can sir
 
00:47:05.990 --> 00:47:06.000 align:start position:0%
hi my name is William McDuff I'm a
 
00:47:08.309 --> 00:47:08.319 align:start position:0%
Hunter living in Carrol County uh as
 
00:47:09.710 --> 00:47:09.720 align:start position:0%
part of The Hunting Community I've been
 
00:47:12.109 --> 00:47:12.119 align:start position:0%
able to participate in several small
 
00:47:14.990 --> 00:47:15.000 align:start position:0%
discussions with uh some fellow hunters
 
00:47:16.270 --> 00:47:16.280 align:start position:0%
and it's our belief that the current
 
00:47:17.829 --> 00:47:17.839 align:start position:0%
list of approved calibers for hunting
 
00:47:19.589 --> 00:47:19.599 align:start position:0%
white tail in New Hampshire could
 
00:47:21.150 --> 00:47:21.160 align:start position:0%
definitely be approved
 
00:47:24.349 --> 00:47:24.359 align:start position:0%
upon um this current list would benefit
 
00:47:26.750 --> 00:47:26.760 align:start position:0%
from the addition of the Cal before you
 
00:47:34.069 --> 00:47:34.079 align:start position:0%
45 ACP 460 Roland 45 super 50 AE 357 Sig
 
00:47:38.150 --> 00:47:38.160 align:start position:0%
327 Federal Magnum and 400 Corbin um
 
00:47:39.910 --> 00:47:39.920 align:start position:0%
through my research I found that the
 
00:47:42.270 --> 00:47:42.280 align:start position:0%
above pistol calibers have a higher
 
00:47:45.470 --> 00:47:45.480 align:start position:0%
muzzle velocity in feet per second and
 
00:47:48.190 --> 00:47:48.200 align:start position:0%
also deliver more muzzle energy in foot
 
00:47:51.630 --> 00:47:51.640 align:start position:0%
pounds of force than 45 Co which is
 
00:47:54.430 --> 00:47:54.440 align:start position:0%
currently on the list of approved pistol
 
00:47:56.870 --> 00:47:56.880 align:start position:0%
calibers in my written testimony I
 
00:47:58.750 --> 00:47:58.760 align:start position:0%
forgot to include that I'm also asking
 
00:48:01.270 --> 00:48:01.280 align:start position:0%
for a change to the amount of rounds
 
00:48:02.829 --> 00:48:02.839 align:start position:0%
that a hunter can have loaded in a
 
00:48:05.630 --> 00:48:05.640 align:start position:0%
handgun while hunting the current is
 
00:48:06.990 --> 00:48:07.000 align:start position:0%
five and I'm requesting that to be
 
00:48:10.710 --> 00:48:10.720 align:start position:0%
changed to six um as representative
 
00:48:14.910 --> 00:48:14.920 align:start position:0%
laflam mentioned that is because most
 
00:48:14.920 --> 00:48:16.270 align:start position:0%
laflam mentioned that is because most
modern

00:48:16.270 --> 00:48:16.280 align:start position:0%
modern
 
00:48:19.030 --> 00:48:19.040 align:start position:0%
revolvers do have a capacity of six
 
00:48:22.430 --> 00:48:22.440 align:start position:0%
rounds um and thinking through this
 
00:48:23.990 --> 00:48:24.000 align:start position:0%
personally I'd be kind of disappointed
 
00:48:26.150 --> 00:48:26.160 align:start position:0%
in myself if I did try and take a deer
 
00:48:30.630 --> 00:48:30.640 align:start position:0%
during hunting season and happen to land
 
00:48:36.270 --> 00:48:36.280 align:start position:0%
on an empty chamber um I believe the
 
00:48:37.670 --> 00:48:37.680 align:start position:0%
allowing these changes would make it
 
00:48:39.630 --> 00:48:39.640 align:start position:0%
easier for a new generation of hunters
 
00:48:41.430 --> 00:48:41.440 align:start position:0%
to find a passion in the New England
 
00:48:41.440 --> 00:48:42.710 align:start position:0%
to find a passion in the New England

Heritage and I am open for any questions
 
00:48:48.710 --> 00:48:48.720 align:start position:0%
that anyone might
 
00:48:52.990 --> 00:48:53.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:57.190 --> 00:48:57.200 align:start position:0%
McDuff online anybody want to talk
 
00:48:58.829 --> 00:48:58.839 align:start position:0%
there being none Mr McDuff thank you for
 
00:48:58.839 --> 00:49:01.230 align:start position:0%
there being none Mr McDuff thank you for
your

00:49:01.230 --> 00:49:01.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:03.670 --> 00:49:03.680 align:start position:0%
testimony Colonel Jordan would you mind
 
00:49:04.870 --> 00:49:04.880 align:start position:0%
stepping up to the mic to answer a
 
00:49:04.880 --> 00:49:10.309 align:start position:0%
stepping up to the mic to answer a
couple

00:49:10.309 --> 00:49:10.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:13.190 --> 00:49:13.200 align:start position:0%
questions thank you Colonel Jordan so if
 
00:49:15.150 --> 00:49:15.160 align:start position:0%
you could speak specifically to the six
 
00:49:18.109 --> 00:49:18.119 align:start position:0%
rounds versus five rounds um the
 
00:49:21.069 --> 00:49:21.079 align:start position:0%
Department's position I I will make the
 
00:49:23.030 --> 00:49:23.040 align:start position:0%
committee aware we have two amendments
 
00:49:24.950 --> 00:49:24.960 align:start position:0%
pending that that we have set aside and
 
00:49:27.270 --> 00:49:27.280 align:start position:0%
you've all been email the copy one of
 
00:49:28.710 --> 00:49:28.720 align:start position:0%
which would bring us back down to five
 
00:49:30.710 --> 00:49:30.720 align:start position:0%
if it's necessary so we have act we have
 
00:49:32.470 --> 00:49:32.480 align:start position:0%
something we can take action on there's
 
00:49:34.870 --> 00:49:34.880 align:start position:0%
also another amendment on the next bill
 
00:49:36.789 --> 00:49:36.799 align:start position:0%
that will bring all rifles up to six so
 
00:49:39.549 --> 00:49:39.559 align:start position:0%
we have consistency across all
 
00:49:39.559 --> 00:49:41.589 align:start position:0%
we have consistency across all
firearms

00:49:41.589 --> 00:49:41.599 align:start position:0%
firearms
 
00:49:45.430 --> 00:49:45.440 align:start position:0%
so reviewed the commission reviewed this
 
00:49:47.230 --> 00:49:47.240 align:start position:0%
didn't we were a bit hesitant to come
 
00:49:49.990 --> 00:49:50.000 align:start position:0%
out an actual support of the change the
 
00:49:52.750 --> 00:49:52.760 align:start position:0%
only reason that were hesitant is I'm
 
00:49:55.549 --> 00:49:55.559 align:start position:0%
not familiar and others in the agency
 
00:49:57.270 --> 00:49:57.280 align:start position:0%
not familiar with how these came about
 
00:49:58.870 --> 00:49:58.880 align:start position:0%
originally so we're concerned about
 
00:50:01.549 --> 00:50:01.559 align:start position:0%
saying to a municipality that felt it
 
00:50:03.990 --> 00:50:04.000 align:start position:0%
was a safety concern well it's really
 
00:50:06.030 --> 00:50:06.040 align:start position:0%
none of our business to say that's not a
 
00:50:08.270 --> 00:50:08.280 align:start position:0%
concern anymore we should allow this now
 
00:50:11.030 --> 00:50:11.040 align:start position:0%
having said that I tend to agree with
 
00:50:12.990 --> 00:50:13.000 align:start position:0%
the legislation as it's written I think
 
00:50:16.190 --> 00:50:16.200 align:start position:0%
if you look at the ballistics on these
 
00:50:18.589 --> 00:50:18.599 align:start position:0%
in the bill on these two calibers that
 
00:50:20.910 --> 00:50:20.920 align:start position:0%
the representatives are adding you'll
 
00:50:22.670 --> 00:50:22.680 align:start position:0%
see that a lot of them are in fact below
 
00:50:25.670 --> 00:50:25.680 align:start position:0%
what's already allowed in so remember
 
00:50:27.109 --> 00:50:27.119 align:start position:0%
loaders are not what they used to be
 
00:50:28.270 --> 00:50:28.280 align:start position:0%
have muzzle loaders that are very
 
00:50:30.150 --> 00:50:30.160 align:start position:0%
effective to shoot very long ranges we
 
00:50:32.549 --> 00:50:32.559 align:start position:0%
have shotguns that with deer barrels
 
00:50:35.270 --> 00:50:35.280 align:start position:0%
that are rifled that send a slug out at
 
00:50:37.510 --> 00:50:37.520 align:start position:0%
a long distance a lot longer than was
 
00:50:39.910 --> 00:50:39.920 align:start position:0%
originally U common when these laws were
 
00:50:42.270 --> 00:50:42.280 align:start position:0%
put into place so the only thing that I
 
00:50:44.549 --> 00:50:44.559 align:start position:0%
saw that we saw the department saw that
 
00:50:47.390 --> 00:50:47.400 align:start position:0%
we were concerned about was this bill
 
00:50:49.309 --> 00:50:49.319 align:start position:0%
originally was asking for six rounds and
 
00:50:51.789 --> 00:50:51.799 align:start position:0%
I get that it's a revolver and people
 
00:50:54.190 --> 00:50:54.200 align:start position:0%
want a full cylinder and I understand
 
00:50:55.589 --> 00:50:55.599 align:start position:0%
what I'm concerned about is when we we
 
00:50:55.599 --> 00:50:56.549 align:start position:0%
what I'm concerned about is when we we
create

00:50:56.549 --> 00:50:56.559 align:start position:0%
create
 
00:50:59.390 --> 00:50:59.400 align:start position:0%
legislation that confuses people or has
 
00:51:01.349 --> 00:51:01.359 align:start position:0%
the ability to confuse people we make
 
00:51:02.710 --> 00:51:02.720 align:start position:0%
criminals out of people that typically
 
00:51:03.990 --> 00:51:04.000 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be criminals they make a
 
00:51:06.309 --> 00:51:06.319 align:start position:0%
mistake if they get abused so most of
 
00:51:09.430 --> 00:51:09.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:11.950 --> 00:51:11.960 align:start position:0%
20732 which talks about semi-automatic
 
00:51:13.910 --> 00:51:13.920 align:start position:0%
and fully automatic rifles can only be
 
00:51:16.309 --> 00:51:16.319 align:start position:0%
can only hunting at five rounds so I was
 
00:51:18.309 --> 00:51:18.319 align:start position:0%
worried that if we didn't have a
 
00:51:21.030 --> 00:51:21.040 align:start position:0%
consistent number here that we' have in
 
00:51:22.470 --> 00:51:22.480 align:start position:0%
in one town in the state you could H
 
00:51:24.030 --> 00:51:24.040 align:start position:0%
with five rounds but in another town you
 
00:51:25.710 --> 00:51:25.720 align:start position:0%
could use six and you got to create
 
00:51:27.190 --> 00:51:27.200 align:start position:0%
situation where people are going to
 
00:51:28.670 --> 00:51:28.680 align:start position:0%
cross the line and they typically
 
00:51:31.589 --> 00:51:31.599 align:start position:0%
wouldn't I don't mind a bit picking or
 
00:51:34.190 --> 00:51:34.200 align:start position:0%
summonsing a CRI that's my job but I
 
00:51:36.109 --> 00:51:36.119 align:start position:0%
don't like summonsing someone when I
 
00:51:38.349 --> 00:51:38.359 align:start position:0%
walk away thinking that person really
 
00:51:40.470 --> 00:51:40.480 align:start position:0%
made a mistake was confused on law so we
 
00:51:43.230 --> 00:51:43.240 align:start position:0%
asked the sponsors to decide either five
 
00:51:45.670 --> 00:51:45.680 align:start position:0%
or six we've kind of gone with sticks
 
00:51:47.190 --> 00:51:47.200 align:start position:0%
and the reason we did that was because
 
00:51:49.069 --> 00:51:49.079 align:start position:0%
what you've already heard revolvers were
 
00:51:51.670 --> 00:51:51.680 align:start position:0%
being used that would require that we
 
00:51:55.990 --> 00:51:56.000 align:start position:0%
also amend 20732 to lead six for all all
 
00:51:57.870 --> 00:51:57.880 align:start position:0%
firearms across the board so no matter
 
00:51:59.630 --> 00:51:59.640 align:start position:0%
what you hun with in the state of no
 
00:52:01.270 --> 00:52:01.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire if this bill were to pass for
 
00:52:04.030 --> 00:52:04.040 align:start position:0%
this amendment you would be required to
 
00:52:07.150 --> 00:52:07.160 align:start position:0%
carry SPS do matter how many what the
 
00:52:09.990 --> 00:52:10.000 align:start position:0%
capacity of your magazine you have a 30
 
00:52:11.670 --> 00:52:11.680 align:start position:0%
round magazine as long as you're only
 
00:52:13.150 --> 00:52:13.160 align:start position:0%
hunting with six rounds in it when
 
00:52:15.109 --> 00:52:15.119 align:start position:0%
you're hunting for deer or six rounds in
 
00:52:16.870 --> 00:52:16.880 align:start position:0%
you will always be legal I think that's
 
00:52:19.470 --> 00:52:19.480 align:start position:0%
simple it's less confusing for folks I
 
00:52:22.190 --> 00:52:22.200 align:start position:0%
don't see it being a resource issue and
 
00:52:24.549 --> 00:52:24.559 align:start position:0%
we feel comfortable saying that we would
 
00:52:25.829 --> 00:52:25.839 align:start position:0%
support that change
 
00:52:27.390 --> 00:52:27.400 align:start position:0%
I'm a little bit hesitant to say I
 
00:52:29.069 --> 00:52:29.079 align:start position:0%
support the entire change for the
 
00:52:31.430 --> 00:52:31.440 align:start position:0%
reasons I've already stated but the
 
00:52:35.109 --> 00:52:35.119 align:start position:0%
commission doesn't I say that thank you
 
00:52:36.549 --> 00:52:36.559 align:start position:0%
I do have one follow-up question for
 
00:52:39.630 --> 00:52:39.640 align:start position:0%
that um so when a a hunter is in the
 
00:52:41.789 --> 00:52:41.799 align:start position:0%
woods and he's carrying a three for7 for
 
00:52:43.990 --> 00:52:44.000 align:start position:0%
personal safety yes he can carry it with
 
00:52:45.510 --> 00:52:45.520 align:start position:0%
six rounds but if he's hunting with that
 
00:52:47.109 --> 00:52:47.119 align:start position:0%
he can only carry it five rounds doesn't
 
00:52:48.950 --> 00:52:48.960 align:start position:0%
that create a problem for enforcement at
 
00:52:52.030 --> 00:52:52.040 align:start position:0%
timeses it does and that is that's this
 
00:52:54.510 --> 00:52:54.520 align:start position:0%
would clear all of that that's why the
 
00:52:58.750 --> 00:52:58.760 align:start position:0%
six round would be the way that iar all
 
00:53:00.190 --> 00:53:00.200 align:start position:0%
thank you Colonel any further questions
 
00:53:06.349 --> 00:53:06.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:15.550 --> 00:53:15.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:15.560 --> 00:53:20.589 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

00:53:20.589 --> 00:53:20.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:26.069 --> 00:53:26.079 align:start position:0%
on is yours on y um colonel you raised
 
00:53:28.950 --> 00:53:28.960 align:start position:0%
an issue that said you didn't understand
 
00:53:32.230 --> 00:53:32.240 align:start position:0%
where this came from in certain towns in
 
00:53:34.670 --> 00:53:34.680 align:start position:0%
the history of that are we are going to
 
00:53:38.870 --> 00:53:38.880 align:start position:0%
be stepping on one or multitude of towns
 
00:53:41.870 --> 00:53:41.880 align:start position:0%
Now by changing this law well that those
 
00:53:43.349 --> 00:53:43.359 align:start position:0%
are questions that we didn't have the
 
00:53:47.150 --> 00:53:47.160 align:start position:0%
answers to so um I'm assuming that back
 
00:53:49.870 --> 00:53:49.880 align:start position:0%
when this became law it was brought
 
00:53:52.510 --> 00:53:52.520 align:start position:0%
because towns were certain towns that
 
00:53:54.829 --> 00:53:54.839 align:start position:0%
had the we call them shotgun only towns
 
00:53:56.109 --> 00:53:56.119 align:start position:0%
that had these restrictions were
 
00:53:58.230 --> 00:53:58.240 align:start position:0%
concerned about safety I don't know we
 
00:54:00.510 --> 00:54:00.520 align:start position:0%
didn't chti game department wasn't part
 
00:54:03.750 --> 00:54:03.760 align:start position:0%
of that so um I don't know how that
 
00:54:05.549 --> 00:54:05.559 align:start position:0%
started so we were a little hesitant to
 
00:54:08.710 --> 00:54:08.720 align:start position:0%
say that today it's we want conquer to
 
00:54:11.990 --> 00:54:12.000 align:start position:0%
go back to the old ways um like you know
 
00:54:14.510 --> 00:54:14.520 align:start position:0%
I think so two things I would say to
 
00:54:18.549 --> 00:54:18.559 align:start position:0%
that one U my legal coordinator at G
 
00:54:20.589 --> 00:54:20.599 align:start position:0%
Paul Sanderson did make a recommendation
 
00:54:22.750 --> 00:54:22.760 align:start position:0%
it's purely his recommendation and I
 
00:54:24.589 --> 00:54:24.599 align:start position:0%
don't necessarily disagree with it that
 
00:54:27.270 --> 00:54:27.280 align:start position:0%
maybe having the municipal Association
 
00:54:30.549 --> 00:54:30.559 align:start position:0%
review this would be a good idea um
 
00:54:34.109 --> 00:54:34.119 align:start position:0%
that's one suggestion that he made
 
00:54:39.390 --> 00:54:39.400 align:start position:0%
um and uh but as far as the um resource
 
00:54:41.030 --> 00:54:41.040 align:start position:0%
hurting you know killing having any
 
00:54:43.430 --> 00:54:43.440 align:start position:0%
effective power to take a deer humanely
 
00:54:45.150 --> 00:54:45.160 align:start position:0%
uh all the other concerns that would
 
00:54:47.589 --> 00:54:47.599 align:start position:0%
that that uh involve hunting and fishing
 
00:54:50.069 --> 00:54:50.079 align:start position:0%
that we are involved in other than the
 
00:54:51.950 --> 00:54:51.960 align:start position:0%
the number of rounds was the only
 
00:54:54.710 --> 00:54:54.720 align:start position:0%
concern that we had um I I don't want to
 
00:54:56.470 --> 00:54:56.480 align:start position:0%
speak for these towns because I don't
 
00:54:58.950 --> 00:54:58.960 align:start position:0%
think I have the authority to do that
 
00:55:02.430 --> 00:55:02.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:06.950 --> 00:55:06.960 align:start position:0%
or we don't I I can also say we don't
 
00:55:08.670 --> 00:55:08.680 align:start position:0%
have a lot of issues we haven't had a
 
00:55:13.069 --> 00:55:13.079 align:start position:0%
lot of issues follow up followup do do
 
00:55:15.510 --> 00:55:15.520 align:start position:0%
you have any idea or does anybody have
 
00:55:17.510 --> 00:55:17.520 align:start position:0%
any idea how many
 
00:55:21.069 --> 00:55:21.079 align:start position:0%
towns excuse me would be affected by uh
 
00:55:21.079 --> 00:55:23.990 align:start position:0%
towns excuse me would be affected by uh
this

00:55:23.990 --> 00:55:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:27.390 --> 00:55:27.400 align:start position:0%
legislation I believe there five towns
 
00:55:29.349 --> 00:55:29.359 align:start position:0%
in the southern part of State yes that
 
00:55:31.829 --> 00:55:31.839 align:start position:0%
this would make a change and just the
 
00:55:31.839 --> 00:55:32.910 align:start position:0%
this would make a change and just the
last

00:55:32.910 --> 00:55:32.920 align:start position:0%
last
 
00:55:36.789 --> 00:55:36.799 align:start position:0%
one thank you um and I didn't thank you
 
00:55:38.510 --> 00:55:38.520 align:start position:0%
for taking my questions at the beginning
 
00:55:41.670 --> 00:55:41.680 align:start position:0%
and I apologize for that Sumer time
 
00:55:44.029 --> 00:55:44.039 align:start position:0%
getting back into it
 
00:55:46.549 --> 00:55:46.559 align:start position:0%
um has any have we heard from any of
 
00:55:48.750 --> 00:55:48.760 align:start position:0%
those five towns no and that was the
 
00:55:49.950 --> 00:55:49.960 align:start position:0%
next thing I was going I don't want to
 
00:55:51.990 --> 00:55:52.000 align:start position:0%
speak for them but I would think if if
 
00:55:53.670 --> 00:55:53.680 align:start position:0%
there was a concern this is their
 
00:55:54.990 --> 00:55:55.000 align:start position:0%
opportunity to voice those concern
 
00:55:56.829 --> 00:55:56.839 align:start position:0%
concerns and I've not no one has reached
 
00:55:59.390 --> 00:55:59.400 align:start position:0%
out to the department that I'm aware of
 
00:56:04.710 --> 00:56:04.720 align:start position:0%
um to do that so thank you thank you sir
 
00:56:05.910 --> 00:56:05.920 align:start position:0%
thank you representative wol thank you
 
00:56:09.430 --> 00:56:09.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:11.829 --> 00:56:11.839 align:start position:0%
spine thank you Mr chair and and thank
 
00:56:14.270 --> 00:56:14.280 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question um you had
 
00:56:16.549 --> 00:56:16.559 align:start position:0%
mentioned briefly that uh ballistics on
 
00:56:19.349 --> 00:56:19.359 align:start position:0%
the modern shotguns and uh modern muzzle
 
00:56:23.430 --> 00:56:23.440 align:start position:0%
loaders are already in excess of uh most
 
00:56:25.349 --> 00:56:25.359 align:start position:0%
of the handgun rounds that we're talking
 
00:56:30.230 --> 00:56:30.240 align:start position:0%
about um I believe that this designation
 
00:56:31.670 --> 00:56:31.680 align:start position:0%
of shotgun only towns has been around
 
00:56:36.190 --> 00:56:36.200 align:start position:0%
for a very long time and uh so I would
 
00:56:38.430 --> 00:56:38.440 align:start position:0%
imagine that if they were going to have
 
00:56:40.430 --> 00:56:40.440 align:start position:0%
problems with the ballistics on these
 
00:56:42.069 --> 00:56:42.079 align:start position:0%
handgun rounds they would have already
 
00:56:43.510 --> 00:56:43.520 align:start position:0%
brought up problems with the modern
 
00:56:45.109 --> 00:56:45.119 align:start position:0%
shotguns and muzzle loaders because
 
00:56:46.950 --> 00:56:46.960 align:start position:0%
those are far in excess of what they
 
00:56:49.109 --> 00:56:49.119 align:start position:0%
used to be would would you be able to
 
00:56:51.230 --> 00:56:51.240 align:start position:0%
speak on that yes I would agree with
 
00:56:53.270 --> 00:56:53.280 align:start position:0%
that and I base that on the fact that we
 
00:56:56.710 --> 00:56:56.720 align:start position:0%
not had any issues uh in these towns uh
 
00:56:58.510 --> 00:56:58.520 align:start position:0%
with that and you're you're absolutely
 
00:57:00.270 --> 00:57:00.280 align:start position:0%
right the shot as I said earlier the
 
00:57:03.670 --> 00:57:03.680 align:start position:0%
shotgun and muzzle loader advant
 
00:57:06.510 --> 00:57:06.520 align:start position:0%
advances have have come twofold what
 
00:57:08.069 --> 00:57:08.079 align:start position:0%
they used to be so some of these
 
00:57:11.349 --> 00:57:11.359 align:start position:0%
shotguns are traveling up near 14 1500
 
00:57:14.230 --> 00:57:14.240 align:start position:0%
feet per second so and the handguns are
 
00:57:17.270 --> 00:57:17.280 align:start position:0%
far below that so I'm not I am not
 
00:57:19.549 --> 00:57:19.559 align:start position:0%
concerned I personally I'm not concerned
 
00:57:22.990 --> 00:57:23.000 align:start position:0%
about safety I think um I think we're
 
00:57:25.230 --> 00:57:25.240 align:start position:0%
well within the guidelines that for in
 
00:57:26.710 --> 00:57:26.720 align:start position:0%
the original legislation for that I
 
00:57:28.870 --> 00:57:28.880 align:start position:0%
don't think this abends that I think it
 
00:57:31.230 --> 00:57:31.240 align:start position:0%
updates it which is necessary and I
 
00:57:33.910 --> 00:57:33.920 align:start position:0%
think that sixth round clarification
 
00:57:35.270 --> 00:57:35.280 align:start position:0%
important because we'll create a
 
00:57:37.950 --> 00:57:37.960 align:start position:0%
confusion there long as we can put that
 
00:57:40.750 --> 00:57:40.760 align:start position:0%
Amendment on it so that it's easy to
 
00:57:42.270 --> 00:57:42.280 align:start position:0%
understand for everyone and they don't
 
00:57:43.750 --> 00:57:43.760 align:start position:0%
have to worry about boundary lines and
 
00:57:45.270 --> 00:57:45.280 align:start position:0%
how many rounds they have I think it'll
 
00:57:48.390 --> 00:57:48.400 align:start position:0%
be work that's my
 
00:57:50.829 --> 00:57:50.839 align:start position:0%
opinion thank you Colonel any further
 
00:57:53.789 --> 00:57:53.799 align:start position:0%
questions for Colonel
 
00:57:56.190 --> 00:57:56.200 align:start position:0%
Jordan they being none thank you again
 
00:57:58.029 --> 00:57:58.039 align:start position:0%
Colonel is there anyone else who would
 
00:58:04.190 --> 00:58:04.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:07.349 --> 00:58:07.359 align:start position:0%
192 saying nobody I'll close the public
 
00:58:11.430 --> 00:58:11.440 align:start position:0%
hearing on House Bill 92 we had 22 20
 
00:58:14.390 --> 00:58:14.400 align:start position:0%
people in support 22 opposed written
 
00:58:14.400 --> 00:58:17.789 align:start position:0%
people in support 22 opposed written
signed

00:58:17.789 --> 00:58:17.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:20.990 --> 00:58:21.000 align:start position:0%
in we are exactly on time which doesn't
 
00:58:24.029 --> 00:58:24.039 align:start position:0%
happen often in the house um we'll move
 
00:58:27.309 --> 00:58:27.319 align:start position:0%
on to house Bill 342 relative to the
 
00:58:29.029 --> 00:58:29.039 align:start position:0%
taking a game by certain lever action
 
00:58:31.870 --> 00:58:31.880 align:start position:0%
firearms and I recognize rep Spain to
 
00:58:34.870 --> 00:58:34.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:37.230 --> 00:58:37.240 align:start position:0%
bill please give the clerk a few minutes
 
00:58:53.710 --> 00:58:53.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:53.720 --> 00:59:04.950 align:start position:0%
 
up

00:59:04.950 --> 00:59:04.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:07.150 --> 00:59:07.160 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair members of the
 
00:59:11.109 --> 00:59:11.119 align:start position:0%
committee I am here to introduce uh
 
00:59:13.950 --> 00:59:13.960 align:start position:0%
342 uh which is a bill that I put in on
 
00:59:15.029 --> 00:59:15.039 align:start position:0%
behalf of a
 
00:59:17.470 --> 00:59:17.480 align:start position:0%
constituent I had tried to put this bill
 
00:59:19.349 --> 00:59:19.359 align:start position:0%
in a number of years ago but the
 
00:59:22.910 --> 00:59:22.920 align:start position:0%
language was far too broad uh the intent
 
00:59:26.430 --> 00:59:26.440 align:start position:0%
was to add a of safety into the towns
 
00:59:29.390 --> 00:59:29.400 align:start position:0%
where uh handgun only handgun and
 
00:59:33.270 --> 00:59:33.280 align:start position:0%
shotgun as the the colonel clarified is
 
00:59:35.829 --> 00:59:35.839 align:start position:0%
uh is currently allowed to also allow
 
00:59:39.230 --> 00:59:39.240 align:start position:0%
people to use a lever action carbine a
 
00:59:41.750 --> 00:59:41.760 align:start position:0%
rifle that shoots the same bullet as the
 
00:59:44.829 --> 00:59:44.839 align:start position:0%
the uh handgun shoots uh the reason for
 
00:59:47.029 --> 00:59:47.039 align:start position:0%
this is purely one of safety uh when it
 
00:59:49.190 --> 00:59:49.200 align:start position:0%
was brought to my attention it made it
 
00:59:51.870 --> 00:59:51.880 align:start position:0%
entirely way too much sense to me uh I
 
00:59:53.430 --> 00:59:53.440 align:start position:0%
had to go forward with with trying to
 
00:59:57.069 --> 00:59:57.079 align:start position:0%
push this and in the uh effort of trying
 
00:59:59.670 --> 00:59:59.680 align:start position:0%
to move forward and show that uh that it
 
01:00:01.789 --> 01:00:01.799 align:start position:0%
could successfully be done I narrowed
 
01:00:04.390 --> 01:00:04.400 align:start position:0%
the scope to three specific calibers
 
01:00:06.430 --> 01:00:06.440 align:start position:0%
that are very commonly carried in both a
 
01:00:08.190 --> 01:00:08.200 align:start position:0%
handgun and a lever action for hunting
 
01:00:10.309 --> 01:00:10.319 align:start position:0%
in the New Hampshire Woods that would be
 
01:00:13.630 --> 01:00:13.640 align:start position:0%
the 357 Magnum the 44 magnum and the 45
 
01:00:13.640 --> 01:00:14.990 align:start position:0%
the 357 Magnum the 44 magnum and the 45
Long

01:00:14.990 --> 01:00:15.000 align:start position:0%
Long
 
01:00:17.190 --> 01:00:17.200 align:start position:0%
Colt these
 
01:00:21.270 --> 01:00:21.280 align:start position:0%
three uh calibers when you're talking
 
01:00:24.230 --> 01:00:24.240 align:start position:0%
about a hunting pistol which is a 10 to
 
01:00:27.029 --> 01:00:27.039 align:start position:0%
12 in Barrel versus an a lever action
 
01:00:29.789 --> 01:00:29.799 align:start position:0%
carbine which is 18 in or less the
 
01:00:32.990 --> 01:00:33.000 align:start position:0%
muzzle velocity is typically less than
 
01:00:36.829 --> 01:00:36.839 align:start position:0%
200 feet per second and the uh
 
01:00:38.750 --> 01:00:38.760 align:start position:0%
trajectory and ballistics I've handed
 
01:00:41.109 --> 01:00:41.119 align:start position:0%
out a uh a handout to everyone I can
 
01:00:44.390 --> 01:00:44.400 align:start position:0%
also display um later on if somebody
 
01:00:46.710 --> 01:00:46.720 align:start position:0%
needs to the the charts but you you
 
01:00:47.950 --> 01:00:47.960 align:start position:0%
should see that there's a ballistics
 
01:00:49.589 --> 01:00:49.599 align:start position:0%
chart that was handed out and if you
 
01:00:51.029 --> 01:00:51.039 align:start position:0%
didn't get one there're down at the end
 
01:00:55.230 --> 01:00:55.240 align:start position:0%
of the table um the
 
01:00:58.230 --> 01:00:58.240 align:start position:0%
the uh changes at muzzle velocity are
 
01:01:00.349 --> 01:01:00.359 align:start position:0%
only about 200 or so feet per second
 
01:01:02.990 --> 01:01:03.000 align:start position:0%
which is not anything to really speak of
 
01:01:04.910 --> 01:01:04.920 align:start position:0%
and the changes at 50 yards is even less
 
01:01:07.390 --> 01:01:07.400 align:start position:0%
than that but what the lever action
 
01:01:09.950 --> 01:01:09.960 align:start position:0%
rifle does give you is the added
 
01:01:12.950 --> 01:01:12.960 align:start position:0%
stability of a shoulder stock and the
 
01:01:15.829 --> 01:01:15.839 align:start position:0%
ability to much more accurately deliver
 
01:01:18.549 --> 01:01:18.559 align:start position:0%
that round down range so there is less
 
01:01:21.630 --> 01:01:21.640 align:start position:0%
chance for stray bullets and less chance
 
01:01:25.589 --> 01:01:25.599 align:start position:0%
for missed shots uh or bad shots on the
 
01:01:28.190 --> 01:01:28.200 align:start position:0%
animal that you're shooting at um I will
 
01:01:30.710 --> 01:01:30.720 align:start position:0%
let Colonel Jordan get into more details
 
01:01:32.910 --> 01:01:32.920 align:start position:0%
on that but uh it's my understanding
 
01:01:34.549 --> 01:01:34.559 align:start position:0%
after talking with the commission and
 
01:01:36.430 --> 01:01:36.440 align:start position:0%
talking with fishing game that they're
 
01:01:39.910 --> 01:01:39.920 align:start position:0%
entirely uh 100% support in support of
 
01:01:41.589 --> 01:01:41.599 align:start position:0%
the fact that this is going to add
 
01:01:43.910 --> 01:01:43.920 align:start position:0%
safety because as anybody who hunts with
 
01:01:45.910 --> 01:01:45.920 align:start position:0%
a handgun knows if you twist your wrist
 
01:01:48.549 --> 01:01:48.559 align:start position:0%
just as as small amount as an eighth of
 
01:01:51.470 --> 01:01:51.480 align:start position:0%
an inch off you are going to make that
 
01:01:55.109 --> 01:01:55.119 align:start position:0%
bullet stray 50 yards away by feet
 
01:01:56.510 --> 01:01:56.520 align:start position:0%
and having that shoulder stock
 
01:01:59.670 --> 01:01:59.680 align:start position:0%
stabilizes everything I will also add
 
01:02:02.190 --> 01:02:02.200 align:start position:0%
that at the request of um Colonel Jordan
 
01:02:04.230 --> 01:02:04.240 align:start position:0%
and Paul Sanderson and fishing game
 
01:02:06.670 --> 01:02:06.680 align:start position:0%
there is an amendment for this bill that
 
01:02:10.069 --> 01:02:10.079 align:start position:0%
will simply add after the current
 
01:02:11.630 --> 01:02:11.640 align:start position:0%
language it doesn't change any of the
 
01:02:13.269 --> 01:02:13.279 align:start position:0%
language of the bill but it adds those
 
01:02:15.109 --> 01:02:15.119 align:start position:0%
two sections in statute that we need to
 
01:02:17.470 --> 01:02:17.480 align:start position:0%
amend from five rounds to six to bring
 
01:02:20.230 --> 01:02:20.240 align:start position:0%
everything up to a consistent six round
 
01:02:21.789 --> 01:02:21.799 align:start position:0%
uh across the board so there's no
 
01:02:24.069 --> 01:02:24.079 align:start position:0%
confusion there's no mistakes and nobody
 
01:02:25.789 --> 01:02:25.799 align:start position:0%
will accidentally have six in their
 
01:02:28.470 --> 01:02:28.480 align:start position:0%
revolver uh when they should have had
 
01:02:31.309 --> 01:02:31.319 align:start position:0%
five and uh I think it's it's something
 
01:02:33.750 --> 01:02:33.760 align:start position:0%
that uh will benefit everybody and
 
01:02:36.029 --> 01:02:36.039 align:start position:0%
prevent more of the situations that the
 
01:02:37.789 --> 01:02:37.799 align:start position:0%
colonel was talking about where somebody
 
01:02:39.829 --> 01:02:39.839 align:start position:0%
made a mistake but now they're a
 
01:02:42.069 --> 01:02:42.079 align:start position:0%
criminal and that's all I have I'll take
 
01:02:46.589 --> 01:02:46.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:48.789 --> 01:02:48.799 align:start position:0%
any does anybody have any questions
 
01:02:48.799 --> 01:02:50.470 align:start position:0%
any does anybody have any questions
representative

01:02:50.470 --> 01:02:50.480 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:02:53.549 --> 01:02:53.559 align:start position:0%
span representative flam has your hand
 
01:02:55.190 --> 01:02:55.200 align:start position:0%
raised go ahead
 
01:02:57.230 --> 01:02:57.240 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you representative
 
01:03:01.109 --> 01:03:01.119 align:start position:0%
Spain my question is um almost out of
 
01:03:03.549 --> 01:03:03.559 align:start position:0%
ignorance when it comes to long guns is
 
01:03:05.109 --> 01:03:05.119 align:start position:0%
there a particular reason why you
 
01:03:07.870 --> 01:03:07.880 align:start position:0%
specified lever action carbins or is it
 
01:03:11.150 --> 01:03:11.160 align:start position:0%
the fact that they only come in lever
 
01:03:14.309 --> 01:03:14.319 align:start position:0%
action actually the carbin come in other
 
01:03:16.309 --> 01:03:16.319 align:start position:0%
uh actions as well I went with the lever
 
01:03:20.190 --> 01:03:20.200 align:start position:0%
action carbine because of the fact that
 
01:03:22.990 --> 01:03:23.000 align:start position:0%
it always has an 18inch or shorter
 
01:03:25.349 --> 01:03:25.359 align:start position:0%
Barrel so to prove the ballistics were
 
01:03:27.109 --> 01:03:27.119 align:start position:0%
not much of an increase in muzzle
 
01:03:29.750 --> 01:03:29.760 align:start position:0%
velocity from a hunting handgun at 10 or
 
01:03:32.829 --> 01:03:32.839 align:start position:0%
12 Ines and in current law and the
 
01:03:34.349 --> 01:03:34.359 align:start position:0%
colonel can back me on this in current
 
01:03:35.789 --> 01:03:35.799 align:start position:0%
law the definition of a handgun for
 
01:03:38.230 --> 01:03:38.240 align:start position:0%
hunting can have up to a 16inch barrel
 
01:03:39.549 --> 01:03:39.559 align:start position:0%
so if you're talking about a difference
 
01:03:42.109 --> 01:03:42.119 align:start position:0%
between a 16inch handgun and an 18inch
 
01:03:44.109 --> 01:03:44.119 align:start position:0%
carbine where the carbine got a shoulder
 
01:03:46.430 --> 01:03:46.440 align:start position:0%
stock and can therefore allow you to
 
01:03:50.109 --> 01:03:50.119 align:start position:0%
stabilize it um that's a much there's no
 
01:03:52.190 --> 01:03:52.200 align:start position:0%
difference like less than 40 feet per
 
01:03:55.109 --> 01:03:55.119 align:start position:0%
second in muzzle velocity and uh and yet
 
01:03:58.870 --> 01:03:58.880 align:start position:0%
you've got an increased accuracy um and
 
01:04:00.870 --> 01:04:00.880 align:start position:0%
uh so I would say that that the lever
 
01:04:03.269 --> 01:04:03.279 align:start position:0%
actions for the carbines are uh always
 
01:04:06.589 --> 01:04:06.599 align:start position:0%
18 inches or less and they are much more
 
01:04:08.549 --> 01:04:08.559 align:start position:0%
easily come by when it comes to talk
 
01:04:11.470 --> 01:04:11.480 align:start position:0%
about these three guns that have those
 
01:04:16.910 --> 01:04:16.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:20.069 --> 01:04:20.079 align:start position:0%
calibers can I can I re-clarify my
 
01:04:24.069 --> 01:04:24.079 align:start position:0%
question follow up go ahead no uh thank
 
01:04:26.269 --> 01:04:26.279 align:start position:0%
you represent of Spain I was wondering
 
01:04:28.870 --> 01:04:28.880 align:start position:0%
why you specified lever action and I
 
01:04:30.910 --> 01:04:30.920 align:start position:0%
didn't know if if like semi-automatics
 
01:04:32.069 --> 01:04:32.079 align:start position:0%
were available I know they were
 
01:04:34.750 --> 01:04:34.760 align:start position:0%
available in 44 mag uh in a regular
 
01:04:36.789 --> 01:04:36.799 align:start position:0%
rifle I didn't know if they were
 
01:04:39.789 --> 01:04:39.799 align:start position:0%
available like in a Carbine um and why
 
01:04:41.630 --> 01:04:41.640 align:start position:0%
you specified lever
 
01:04:43.630 --> 01:04:43.640 align:start position:0%
action part of that comes from the
 
01:04:45.349 --> 01:04:45.359 align:start position:0%
experience uh that we all get as
 
01:04:47.430 --> 01:04:47.440 align:start position:0%
legislators when we put a bill forward
 
01:04:49.069 --> 01:04:49.079 align:start position:0%
and we hear a whole bunch of arguments
 
01:04:50.910 --> 01:04:50.920 align:start position:0%
against it and we come back with in
 
01:04:52.710 --> 01:04:52.720 align:start position:0%
another year with a much more refined
 
01:04:54.870 --> 01:04:54.880 align:start position:0%
and narrowed scope version that we know
 
01:04:58.710 --> 01:04:58.720 align:start position:0%
will pass the lever action carbine is um
 
01:05:03.029 --> 01:05:03.039 align:start position:0%
one that is very common in New Hampshire
 
01:05:05.029 --> 01:05:05.039 align:start position:0%
whereas the semi-automatics and whatnot
 
01:05:08.750 --> 01:05:08.760 align:start position:0%
are are not as common and it also is
 
01:05:10.430 --> 01:05:10.440 align:start position:0%
something narrow enough in scope that
 
01:05:12.510 --> 01:05:12.520 align:start position:0%
there won't be too much argument about
 
01:05:14.150 --> 01:05:14.160 align:start position:0%
what we're talking
 
01:05:19.109 --> 01:05:19.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:21.750 --> 01:05:21.760 align:start position:0%
much any further questions represent
 
01:05:25.230 --> 01:05:25.240 align:start position:0%
representative Harvey go ahead so
 
01:05:28.789 --> 01:05:28.799 align:start position:0%
um is this another in instance where it
 
01:05:31.230 --> 01:05:31.240 align:start position:0%
cannot be um amended through New
 
01:05:33.069 --> 01:05:33.079 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Christian game rules because
 
01:05:37.150 --> 01:05:37.160 align:start position:0%
it's in RSA um it seems to run in my
 
01:05:39.750 --> 01:05:39.760 align:start position:0%
mind sitting through numerous rules uh
 
01:05:42.230 --> 01:05:42.240 align:start position:0%
meetings that the method of take is
 
01:05:44.309 --> 01:05:44.319 align:start position:0%
something that is talked about there
 
01:05:49.190 --> 01:05:49.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:51.390 --> 01:05:51.400 align:start position:0%
legislature I will let Colonel Jordan
 
01:05:53.230 --> 01:05:53.240 align:start position:0%
speak more to that specifically but it's
 
01:05:54.870 --> 01:05:54.880 align:start position:0%
my understanding that because of the
 
01:05:56.430 --> 01:05:56.440 align:start position:0%
fact that we have these pistol only and
 
01:05:58.589 --> 01:05:58.599 align:start position:0%
shotgun only areas that that are in
 
01:06:00.390 --> 01:06:00.400 align:start position:0%
statute that we then now have to amend
 
01:06:02.470 --> 01:06:02.480 align:start position:0%
the statute to say that lever action is
 
01:06:04.069 --> 01:06:04.079 align:start position:0%
equivalent to a pistol in those or
 
01:06:07.789 --> 01:06:07.799 align:start position:0%
handgun in those areas thank
 
01:06:10.069 --> 01:06:10.079 align:start position:0%
you any
 
01:06:13.309 --> 01:06:13.319 align:start position:0%
else on anybody
 
01:06:15.390 --> 01:06:15.400 align:start position:0%
online colon Jordan would you mind
 
01:06:22.990 --> 01:06:23.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:26.230 align:start position:0%
 
questions

01:06:26.230 --> 01:06:26.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:27.910 --> 01:06:27.920 align:start position:0%
no I'll bring that gentleman up to speak
 
01:06:32.630 --> 01:06:32.640 align:start position:0%
in a minute um if you could uh speak to
 
01:06:34.910 --> 01:06:34.920 align:start position:0%
the question we had about ballistics and
 
01:06:37.150 --> 01:06:37.160 align:start position:0%
compared to a 16-inch revolver to an
 
01:06:39.470 --> 01:06:39.480 align:start position:0%
18inch carbine and the safety
 
01:06:42.870 --> 01:06:42.880 align:start position:0%
ramifications ofday so everything
 
01:06:46.190 --> 01:06:46.200 align:start position:0%
represent Spain has said that I remember
 
01:06:48.150 --> 01:06:48.160 align:start position:0%
hearing I was getting messages but I
 
01:06:51.510 --> 01:06:51.520 align:start position:0%
believe is correct um the only uh we
 
01:06:53.269 --> 01:06:53.279 align:start position:0%
didn't again the department didn't
 
01:06:55.390 --> 01:06:55.400 align:start position:0%
support this change and the only reason
 
01:06:57.510 --> 01:06:57.520 align:start position:0%
we didn't is for the same reason we were
 
01:07:00.510 --> 01:07:00.520 align:start position:0%
concerned about the municipality so we
 
01:07:02.950 --> 01:07:02.960 align:start position:0%
didn't see most importantly we didn't
 
01:07:05.150 --> 01:07:05.160 align:start position:0%
see where this would cause harm to the
 
01:07:06.990 --> 01:07:07.000 align:start position:0%
wildlife or the sport of hunting other
 
01:07:09.710 --> 01:07:09.720 align:start position:0%
than uh the round issue again I wanted
 
01:07:12.670 --> 01:07:12.680 align:start position:0%
it to six rounds across the board or
 
01:07:14.950 --> 01:07:14.960 align:start position:0%
five rounds we kind of decide six
 
01:07:17.430 --> 01:07:17.440 align:start position:0%
because of the revolver
 
01:07:20.430 --> 01:07:20.440 align:start position:0%
um uh the question about rules is a very
 
01:07:22.190 --> 01:07:22.200 align:start position:0%
good one so no Hampshire fishing game
 
01:07:24.309 --> 01:07:24.319 align:start position:0%
whenever we come to this committee we
 
01:07:27.950 --> 01:07:27.960 align:start position:0%
try to keep as much as we can for taking
 
01:07:30.230 --> 01:07:30.240 align:start position:0%
regulating the method of tap some of the
 
01:07:31.950 --> 01:07:31.960 align:start position:0%
tools used for tape in administrative
 
01:07:33.470 --> 01:07:33.480 align:start position:0%
rules the reason we do that is that
 
01:07:36.190 --> 01:07:36.200 align:start position:0%
allows us a lot more flexibility to
 
01:07:37.870 --> 01:07:37.880 align:start position:0%
change those when they need to be
 
01:07:40.630 --> 01:07:40.640 align:start position:0%
changed and things come up you know that
 
01:07:42.630 --> 01:07:42.640 align:start position:0%
are while trying to manage Wild Life
 
01:07:45.430 --> 01:07:45.440 align:start position:0%
resources as a tricky business sometimes
 
01:07:47.510 --> 01:07:47.520 align:start position:0%
you have to make changes swiftly and the
 
01:07:49.710 --> 01:07:49.720 align:start position:0%
rules allow us that ability to do that I
 
01:07:51.470 --> 01:07:51.480 align:start position:0%
also like the rule process because it
 
01:07:54.109 --> 01:07:54.119 align:start position:0%
allows the general public a really good
 
01:07:56.870 --> 01:07:56.880 align:start position:0%
opportunity to have in not that this
 
01:07:58.870 --> 01:07:58.880 align:start position:0%
process doesn't but the administrator
 
01:08:01.549 --> 01:08:01.559 align:start position:0%
will process on mandates so it's a good
 
01:08:03.870 --> 01:08:03.880 align:start position:0%
opportunity for people to get there that
 
01:08:06.390 --> 01:08:06.400 align:start position:0%
becomes a problem when we have a a law
 
01:08:09.069 --> 01:08:09.079 align:start position:0%
that's in place already that designates
 
01:08:11.549 --> 01:08:11.559 align:start position:0%
a manner or method of take so we have a
 
01:08:13.990 --> 01:08:14.000 align:start position:0%
law existing we either got to repeal
 
01:08:15.670 --> 01:08:15.680 align:start position:0%
that statute completely and do it all
 
01:08:17.669 --> 01:08:17.679 align:start position:0%
through rule or we've got to we want to
 
01:08:19.990 --> 01:08:20.000 align:start position:0%
change it like we do this one we have to
 
01:08:22.070 --> 01:08:22.080 align:start position:0%
we have to make an amendment to the law
 
01:08:24.749 --> 01:08:24.759 align:start position:0%
so this is the right procedure for this
 
01:08:27.390 --> 01:08:27.400 align:start position:0%
I am not an advocate based on experience
 
01:08:29.829 --> 01:08:29.839 align:start position:0%
of regulating take all through the
 
01:08:31.709 --> 01:08:31.719 align:start position:0%
legislature for a number of reasons I'd
 
01:08:33.470 --> 01:08:33.480 align:start position:0%
rather do it to rule but when you have a
 
01:08:35.789 --> 01:08:35.799 align:start position:0%
law that that states that's already
 
01:08:38.030 --> 01:08:38.040 align:start position:0%
exist like we have here um the only way
 
01:08:39.709 --> 01:08:39.719 align:start position:0%
to change that is going amend law
 
01:08:43.510 --> 01:08:43.520 align:start position:0%
because a LW from a rule in simple Kevin
 
01:08:46.349 --> 01:08:46.359 align:start position:0%
Jord language so um and that's what we
 
01:08:48.910 --> 01:08:48.920 align:start position:0%
have here so we don't I don't have any I
 
01:08:50.870 --> 01:08:50.880 align:start position:0%
I agree with represent Blain what I know
 
01:08:53.470 --> 01:08:53.480 align:start position:0%
about Firearms um I think the lever
 
01:08:55.910 --> 01:08:55.920 align:start position:0%
action was a good choice because I I
 
01:08:57.510 --> 01:08:57.520 align:start position:0%
also agree there are a lot of those out
 
01:08:59.030 --> 01:08:59.040 align:start position:0%
there a lot of people are hunting with
 
01:09:00.749 --> 01:09:00.759 align:start position:0%
those types of firearms so that's a good
 
01:09:03.870 --> 01:09:03.880 align:start position:0%
place to start um the carbine I'm not
 
01:09:05.669 --> 01:09:05.679 align:start position:0%
concerned about the carbine being more
 
01:09:07.550 --> 01:09:07.560 align:start position:0%
dangerous again you're in towns where
 
01:09:09.630 --> 01:09:09.640 align:start position:0%
we're allowing saos to be fired out of
 
01:09:12.229 --> 01:09:12.239 align:start position:0%
mow which are going at at at the same
 
01:09:15.950 --> 01:09:15.960 align:start position:0%
rate as not higher in some cases so um
 
01:09:18.070 --> 01:09:18.080 align:start position:0%
knock on wood we've had a good safety
 
01:09:20.590 --> 01:09:20.600 align:start position:0%
record in those towns and I think it's
 
01:09:22.110 --> 01:09:22.120 align:start position:0%
time to update these have not been
 
01:09:24.709 --> 01:09:24.719 align:start position:0%
updated in a long time and this is an
 
01:09:26.709 --> 01:09:26.719 align:start position:0%
update to that I think it's important
 
01:09:28.349 --> 01:09:28.359 align:start position:0%
and I want to make sure everybody
 
01:09:30.430 --> 01:09:30.440 align:start position:0%
understands fishing gang does we
 
01:09:32.789 --> 01:09:32.799 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have brought this these bills
 
01:09:35.110 --> 01:09:35.120 align:start position:0%
but we don't we're in a position where
 
01:09:37.229 --> 01:09:37.239 align:start position:0%
we don't feel it's going to do any time
 
01:09:38.789 --> 01:09:38.799 align:start position:0%
we're a little bit hesitant to say we
 
01:09:41.309 --> 01:09:41.319 align:start position:0%
support it just based on the concerns of
 
01:09:43.510 --> 01:09:43.520 align:start position:0%
the Town communities and this would be
 
01:09:45.829 --> 01:09:45.839 align:start position:0%
their opportunity to raise their
 
01:09:49.149 --> 01:09:49.159 align:start position:0%
concern hope I said you did and we won't
 
01:09:50.269 --> 01:09:50.279 align:start position:0%
take offense that you don't like
 
01:09:51.510 --> 01:09:51.520 align:start position:0%
legislatures compared to your
 
01:09:56.030 --> 01:09:56.040 align:start position:0%
administrative rules at all that's
 
01:09:58.470 --> 01:09:58.480 align:start position:0%
tricky um any other questions for
 
01:09:58.480 --> 01:09:59.470 align:start position:0%
tricky um any other questions for
Colonel

01:09:59.470 --> 01:09:59.480 align:start position:0%
Colonel
 
01:10:06.229 --> 01:10:06.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:11.709 --> 01:10:11.719 align:start position:0%
close Okay you aware uh probably about
 
01:10:14.470 --> 01:10:14.480 align:start position:0%
18 years ago when this bill finally came
 
01:10:16.830 --> 01:10:16.840 align:start position:0%
to miramac and they went to pistols
 
01:10:19.470 --> 01:10:19.480 align:start position:0%
instead of rifles the trouble we had in
 
01:10:22.229 --> 01:10:22.239 align:start position:0%
marac uh marac was going to shut down
 
01:10:24.470 --> 01:10:24.480 align:start position:0%
hunting altogether Bedford was going to
 
01:10:27.030 --> 01:10:27.040 align:start position:0%
shut down hunting all together and this
 
01:10:29.149 --> 01:10:29.159 align:start position:0%
was part of a deal that we got so we
 
01:10:32.470 --> 01:10:32.480 align:start position:0%
could use hand weapons so what what I'm
 
01:10:34.950 --> 01:10:34.960 align:start position:0%
trying to say is this is very very
 
01:10:36.630 --> 01:10:36.640 align:start position:0%
touchy subject I think we should have
 
01:10:39.229 --> 01:10:39.239 align:start position:0%
had Town meetings on this because marac
 
01:10:40.630 --> 01:10:40.640 align:start position:0%
right away is going to shut down
 
01:10:42.870 --> 01:10:42.880 align:start position:0%
everything Bedford is going to shut down
 
01:10:45.070 --> 01:10:45.080 align:start position:0%
everything Bo is going to shut down
 
01:10:47.189 --> 01:10:47.199 align:start position:0%
everything they're closing a lot of land
 
01:10:50.669 --> 01:10:50.679 align:start position:0%
open to Hunters by going forward with
 
01:10:53.149 --> 01:10:53.159 align:start position:0%
this thank you was there a question in
 
01:10:53.159 --> 01:10:54.870 align:start position:0%
this thank you was there a question in
there

01:10:54.870 --> 01:10:54.880 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:10:56.270 --> 01:10:56.280 align:start position:0%
are you
 
01:10:59.870 --> 01:10:59.880 align:start position:0%
aware I am that was that was one of our
 
01:11:03.030 --> 01:11:03.040 align:start position:0%
I think that was why Paul Sanderson made
 
01:11:04.430 --> 01:11:04.440 align:start position:0%
a good recommendation in written
 
01:11:06.990 --> 01:11:07.000 align:start position:0%
testimony that maybe
 
01:11:09.310 --> 01:11:09.320 align:start position:0%
municipalities you're right that was
 
01:11:12.590 --> 01:11:12.600 align:start position:0%
that was part of the issue this was a
 
01:11:14.990 --> 01:11:15.000 align:start position:0%
negotiation without our involvement very
 
01:11:19.390 --> 01:11:19.400 align:start position:0%
little of our involvement so that's
 
01:11:22.550 --> 01:11:22.560 align:start position:0%
something thank you uh representative
 
01:11:22.560 --> 01:11:25.910 align:start position:0%
something thank you uh representative
Howard

01:11:25.910 --> 01:11:25.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:29.270 --> 01:11:29.280 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair Raymond H thank you
 
01:11:33.189 --> 01:11:33.199 align:start position:0%
Colonel for taking my question uh is
 
01:11:36.830 --> 01:11:36.840 align:start position:0%
there a uh a definition in law of what a
 
01:11:36.840 --> 01:11:41.830 align:start position:0%
there a uh a definition in law of what a
carbine

01:11:41.830 --> 01:11:41.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:44.750 --> 01:11:44.760 align:start position:0%
is I don't I don't I'm trying to think
 
01:11:46.830 --> 01:11:46.840 align:start position:0%
of one I don't know of one that defines
 
01:11:49.669 --> 01:11:49.679 align:start position:0%
a carbine we have rifles long guns that
 
01:11:51.390 --> 01:11:51.400 align:start position:0%
are Define but there I don't think
 
01:11:54.229 --> 01:11:54.239 align:start position:0%
there's clear language car
 
01:11:56.830 --> 01:11:56.840 align:start position:0%
it would be that would be a
 
01:12:00.750 --> 01:12:00.760 align:start position:0%
manufacturers term a type of of of
 
01:12:03.110 --> 01:12:03.120 align:start position:0%
firearm that would probably be accepted
 
01:12:03.120 --> 01:12:04.149 align:start position:0%
firearm that would probably be accepted
based

01:12:04.149 --> 01:12:04.159 align:start position:0%
based
 
01:12:07.149 --> 01:12:07.159 align:start position:0%
on based on
 
01:12:09.910 --> 01:12:09.920 align:start position:0%
manufacturer recommendations rather than
 
01:12:14.110 --> 01:12:14.120 align:start position:0%
law I'm not aware of a law that Guin
 
01:12:16.189 --> 01:12:16.199 align:start position:0%
okay thank
 
01:12:20.750 --> 01:12:20.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:24.110 --> 01:12:24.120 align:start position:0%
Jordan representative Craig
 
01:12:27.110 --> 01:12:27.120 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you Colonel uh
 
01:12:29.830 --> 01:12:29.840 align:start position:0%
I agree with you that there is no law
 
01:12:32.590 --> 01:12:32.600 align:start position:0%
distinguishing a carbide from any other
 
01:12:36.229 --> 01:12:36.239 align:start position:0%
uh long gun but uh would you agree that
 
01:12:39.270 --> 01:12:39.280 align:start position:0%
the general Firearms industry standard
 
01:12:42.110 --> 01:12:42.120 align:start position:0%
is a long gun chambered in a handgun
 
01:12:44.430 --> 01:12:44.440 align:start position:0%
cartridge that's correct that's correct
 
01:12:45.990 --> 01:12:46.000 align:start position:0%
that's if I were going to prove that in
 
01:12:49.910 --> 01:12:49.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:52.669 --> 01:12:52.679 align:start position:0%
information thank you thank you any
 
01:12:54.669 --> 01:12:54.679 align:start position:0%
further questions for Colonel Jordan
 
01:12:54.679 --> 01:13:08.149 align:start position:0%
further questions for Colonel Jordan
representative

01:13:08.149 --> 01:13:08.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:12.709 --> 01:13:12.719 align:start position:0%
wolf thank you um I am very concerned
 
01:13:14.189 --> 01:13:14.199 align:start position:0%
with some of the discussion that seems
 
01:13:17.189 --> 01:13:17.199 align:start position:0%
to be hanging out on the periphery that
 
01:13:19.709 --> 01:13:19.719 align:start position:0%
we're talking about land that may be
 
01:13:22.590 --> 01:13:22.600 align:start position:0%
closed to Hunters because of actions
 
01:13:25.350 --> 01:13:25.360 align:start position:0%
that we're taking today I work very hard
 
01:13:28.870 --> 01:13:28.880 align:start position:0%
to keep my land open for hunting and if
 
01:13:31.990 --> 01:13:32.000 align:start position:0%
certain towns are going to start to go
 
01:13:34.669 --> 01:13:34.679 align:start position:0%
at it just because we're adding two
 
01:13:37.070 --> 01:13:37.080 align:start position:0%
calibers or something of that sort it
 
01:13:40.149 --> 01:13:40.159 align:start position:0%
will affect a huge could affect a huge
 
01:13:42.830 --> 01:13:42.840 align:start position:0%
number of people so I think we ought to
 
01:13:45.990 --> 01:13:46.000 align:start position:0%
think about those issues I guess I
 
01:13:49.669 --> 01:13:49.679 align:start position:0%
didn't hold it down um before
 
01:13:49.679 --> 01:13:52.350 align:start position:0%
didn't hold it down um before
we

01:13:52.350 --> 01:13:52.360 align:start position:0%
we
 
01:13:52.360 --> 01:13:53.870 align:start position:0%
we
legislation

01:13:53.870 --> 01:13:53.880 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
01:14:05.430 --> 01:14:05.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:07.430 --> 01:14:07.440 align:start position:0%
greatly thank you representative wolf if
 
01:14:09.310 --> 01:14:09.320 align:start position:0%
we can keep qu keep it to questions we
 
01:14:10.830 --> 01:14:10.840 align:start position:0%
can talk comments when we get to our
 
01:14:13.550 --> 01:14:13.560 align:start position:0%
work session um but uh representative
 
01:14:15.189 --> 01:14:15.199 align:start position:0%
shirtliff go ahead just know I might
 
01:14:19.310 --> 01:14:19.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:22.270 --> 01:14:22.280 align:start position:0%
fun turn about the
 
01:14:22.280 --> 01:14:23.910 align:start position:0%
fun turn about the
play

01:14:23.910 --> 01:14:23.920 align:start position:0%
play
 
01:14:26.590 --> 01:14:26.600 align:start position:0%
uh good morning Colonel just a follow up
 
01:14:28.950 --> 01:14:28.960 align:start position:0%
on the comments by representative wolf
 
01:14:32.830 --> 01:14:32.840 align:start position:0%
and also representative uh from Chester
 
01:14:35.350 --> 01:14:35.360 align:start position:0%
um do you think it would make sense for
 
01:14:38.229 --> 01:14:38.239 align:start position:0%
this committee to refer both bills 192
 
01:14:38.239 --> 01:14:39.030 align:start position:0%
this committee to refer both bills 192
and

01:14:39.030 --> 01:14:39.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:14:42.590 --> 01:14:42.600 align:start position:0%
342 to a subcommittee together for the
 
01:14:44.550 --> 01:14:44.560 align:start position:0%
sole purpose of allowing the municipal
 
01:14:47.390 --> 01:14:47.400 align:start position:0%
Association to come in and talk about
 
01:14:51.070 --> 01:14:51.080 align:start position:0%
any concerns they might have and I ask
 
01:14:52.950 --> 01:14:52.960 align:start position:0%
that because I think there's Merit to
 
01:14:55.709 --> 01:14:55.719 align:start position:0%
this legislation but it might dampen
 
01:14:57.590 --> 01:14:57.600 align:start position:0%
some of the Town meetings to know that
 
01:14:59.629 --> 01:14:59.639 align:start position:0%
they had a chance to have input in their
 
01:15:02.030 --> 01:15:02.040 align:start position:0%
Association spoke on their behalf and
 
01:15:03.470 --> 01:15:03.480 align:start position:0%
there was no
 
01:15:05.550 --> 01:15:05.560 align:start position:0%
opposition yes than thank you for your
 
01:15:09.110 --> 01:15:09.120 align:start position:0%
question it's good to see oh thank you I
 
01:15:11.189 --> 01:15:11.199 align:start position:0%
don't want Mr Spain the represent Blain
 
01:15:14.709 --> 01:15:14.719 align:start position:0%
to throw his laptop at me but um that is
 
01:15:16.830 --> 01:15:16.840 align:start position:0%
a concern I I just don't want to see
 
01:15:19.470 --> 01:15:19.480 align:start position:0%
Towns close it down and Paul Sanderson
 
01:15:22.189 --> 01:15:22.199 align:start position:0%
wrote in his recommendation committee
 
01:15:23.669 --> 01:15:23.679 align:start position:0%
may wish to consider what these
 
01:15:25.629 --> 01:15:25.639 align:start position:0%
proposals should be referred to the
 
01:15:27.149 --> 01:15:27.159 align:start position:0%
house Municipal and County government
 
01:15:29.030 --> 01:15:29.040 align:start position:0%
committee for additional review and
 
01:15:30.189 --> 01:15:30.199 align:start position:0%
comment it
 
01:15:33.310 --> 01:15:33.320 align:start position:0%
may it may complicate it but it may also
 
01:15:35.950 --> 01:15:35.960 align:start position:0%
prevent towns from uh reacting
 
01:15:38.030 --> 01:15:38.040 align:start position:0%
drastically we we wouldn't want that the
 
01:15:40.310 --> 01:15:40.320 align:start position:0%
department doesn't want that so yeah
 
01:15:42.229 --> 01:15:42.239 align:start position:0%
that I don't think and this is me
 
01:15:44.070 --> 01:15:44.080 align:start position:0%
personally I don't think that's a
 
01:15:48.110 --> 01:15:48.120 align:start position:0%
better thank you representative Harvey
 
01:15:50.110 --> 01:15:50.120 align:start position:0%
so I think I heard you say that uh none
 
01:15:52.270 --> 01:15:52.280 align:start position:0%
of these towns had reached out to New
 
01:15:53.709 --> 01:15:53.719 align:start position:0%
Hampshire fishing game
 
01:15:57.830 --> 01:15:57.840 align:start position:0%
but not all towns are um as Savvy about
 
01:16:00.350 --> 01:16:00.360 align:start position:0%
how to keep up with legislation and and
 
01:16:02.750 --> 01:16:02.760 align:start position:0%
so forth especially when they weren't
 
01:16:04.189 --> 01:16:04.199 align:start position:0%
expecting something like this to come
 
01:16:07.310 --> 01:16:07.320 align:start position:0%
down the pike so my question is even
 
01:16:09.310 --> 01:16:09.320 align:start position:0%
though they didn't reach out to you did
 
01:16:13.590 --> 01:16:13.600 align:start position:0%
you then reach out to them um and if not
 
01:16:17.430 --> 01:16:17.440 align:start position:0%
maybe um would your suggestion of um you
 
01:16:19.550 --> 01:16:19.560 align:start position:0%
know referring to another committee so
 
01:16:22.390 --> 01:16:22.400 align:start position:0%
that they would have a chance they're
 
01:16:24.709 --> 01:16:24.719 align:start position:0%
they're probably probably more likely to
 
01:16:27.590 --> 01:16:27.600 align:start position:0%
look at a municipal committee Bill than
 
01:16:29.629 --> 01:16:29.639 align:start position:0%
fishing game we wouldn't typically reach
 
01:16:31.149 --> 01:16:31.159 align:start position:0%
out to them all then unless we were
 
01:16:32.910 --> 01:16:32.920 align:start position:0%
going to sponsor legislation like this
 
01:16:35.470 --> 01:16:35.480 align:start position:0%
we would then do that um we've always
 
01:16:38.350 --> 01:16:38.360 align:start position:0%
been hesitant to to I think as an agency
 
01:16:41.430 --> 01:16:41.440 align:start position:0%
to to to support something like this and
 
01:16:44.390 --> 01:16:44.400 align:start position:0%
ask that this be brought even uh in this
 
01:16:46.390 --> 01:16:46.400 align:start position:0%
scenario because we're concerned about
 
01:16:48.830 --> 01:16:48.840 align:start position:0%
what the towns have different concerns
 
01:16:51.590 --> 01:16:51.600 align:start position:0%
and I I don't want to be a state agency
 
01:16:54.350 --> 01:16:54.360 align:start position:0%
saying well we don't really care what
 
01:16:56.950 --> 01:16:56.960 align:start position:0%
do you know there may be mitigating
 
01:17:01.550 --> 01:17:01.560 align:start position:0%
factors so I don't think I think if May
 
01:17:04.390 --> 01:17:04.400 align:start position:0%
complicate the passage of the bill but I
 
01:17:06.430 --> 01:17:06.440 align:start position:0%
but I don't want to Lo no one wants
 
01:17:09.629 --> 01:17:09.639 align:start position:0%
including repres wants to lose areas
 
01:17:12.390 --> 01:17:12.400 align:start position:0%
none of us do so um you know if this
 
01:17:13.830 --> 01:17:13.840 align:start position:0%
prevents that then maybe that's the way
 
01:17:17.149 --> 01:17:17.159 align:start position:0%
to know I don't I will say I don't see
 
01:17:19.310 --> 01:17:19.320 align:start position:0%
where this will hurt that safety piece
 
01:17:21.390 --> 01:17:21.400 align:start position:0%
of it I think he's done a good job of
 
01:17:23.709 --> 01:17:23.719 align:start position:0%
keeping this within the guidelines hand
 
01:17:25.830 --> 01:17:25.840 align:start position:0%
guns and shotguns but I just think it's
 
01:17:28.110 --> 01:17:28.120 align:start position:0%
important for the towns to have stay on
 
01:17:31.950 --> 01:17:31.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:35.149 --> 01:17:35.159 align:start position:0%
municip any further questions
 
01:17:37.709 --> 01:17:37.719 align:start position:0%
sorry col just I just want to make sure
 
01:17:38.709 --> 01:17:38.719 align:start position:0%
because we've been talking a lot about
 
01:17:41.189 --> 01:17:41.199 align:start position:0%
ballistics and and safety and everything
 
01:17:42.950 --> 01:17:42.960 align:start position:0%
else and I I want to kind of summarize
 
01:17:44.550 --> 01:17:44.560 align:start position:0%
so I understand what you said to make
 
01:17:47.390 --> 01:17:47.400 align:start position:0%
sure that committee's on board I think
 
01:17:49.350 --> 01:17:49.360 align:start position:0%
you talked about the fact that under
 
01:17:51.229 --> 01:17:51.239 align:start position:0%
current muzzle loaders and c and current
 
01:17:53.629 --> 01:17:53.639 align:start position:0%
shotguns which are allowed in these same
 
01:17:55.709 --> 01:17:55.719 align:start position:0%
municipalities there actually have
 
01:17:58.550 --> 01:17:58.560 align:start position:0%
increased uh ballistic uh ranges
 
01:18:00.669 --> 01:18:00.679 align:start position:0%
ballistic numbers for these and that
 
01:18:03.669 --> 01:18:03.679 align:start position:0%
this is these rounds are actually safe
 
01:18:06.470 --> 01:18:06.480 align:start position:0%
would be for lack of better safer um
 
01:18:08.189 --> 01:18:08.199 align:start position:0%
than some of those other rounds that are
 
01:18:10.030 --> 01:18:10.040 align:start position:0%
currently already allowed in those
 
01:18:13.390 --> 01:18:13.400 align:start position:0%
municipalities and lastly the issue of
 
01:18:16.310 --> 01:18:16.320 align:start position:0%
accuracy and and stability that in a car
 
01:18:17.830 --> 01:18:17.840 align:start position:0%
being compared to a handgun that would
 
01:18:20.229 --> 01:18:20.239 align:start position:0%
be allowed that these guns are actually
 
01:18:22.310 --> 01:18:22.320 align:start position:0%
more or allow for more accuracy
 
01:18:24.669 --> 01:18:24.679 align:start position:0%
depending on the SHO of course but allow
 
01:18:26.430 --> 01:18:26.440 align:start position:0%
for more accuracy is that is that a good
 
01:18:28.310 --> 01:18:28.320 align:start position:0%
summary of what you're saying both good
 
01:18:31.550 --> 01:18:31.560 align:start position:0%
points and I think if we're careful on
 
01:18:33.510 --> 01:18:33.520 align:start position:0%
presenting them if we do a good job
 
01:18:36.270 --> 01:18:36.280 align:start position:0%
presenting them I I think uh we'd be
 
01:18:38.149 --> 01:18:38.159 align:start position:0%
okay but it's going to be a hard sell to
 
01:18:40.390 --> 01:18:40.400 align:start position:0%
those folks that don't understand
 
01:18:43.590 --> 01:18:43.600 align:start position:0%
ballistics like municipality so that's
 
01:18:45.030 --> 01:18:45.040 align:start position:0%
that's going to be a bit of challenge
 
01:18:47.270 --> 01:18:47.280 align:start position:0%
but you're right right and as far as
 
01:18:49.310 --> 01:18:49.320 align:start position:0%
accuracy goes I'd much rather see
 
01:18:52.189 --> 01:18:52.199 align:start position:0%
someone most people shooting at a deer
 
01:18:56.709 --> 01:18:56.719 align:start position:0%
with a long gun hand the opportunity
 
01:18:59.110 --> 01:18:59.120 align:start position:0%
much thank you Colonel any further
 
01:19:00.470 --> 01:19:00.480 align:start position:0%
questions for the
 
01:19:04.430 --> 01:19:04.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:07.430 --> 01:19:07.440 align:start position:0%
none will uh in the attendees we'll
 
01:19:10.070 --> 01:19:10.080 align:start position:0%
recognize uh The Honorable Jr hole who
 
01:19:12.790 --> 01:19:12.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:15.229 --> 01:19:15.239 align:start position:0%
speak morning um chairman Lang and
 
01:19:17.189 --> 01:19:17.199 align:start position:0%
members of the fishing game committee I
 
01:19:19.830 --> 01:19:19.840 align:start position:0%
am here to testify in favor of this bill
 
01:19:22.550 --> 01:19:22.560 align:start position:0%
for three reasons um all of which have
 
01:19:24.750 --> 01:19:24.760 align:start position:0%
been brought up in some form or another
 
01:19:28.390 --> 01:19:28.400 align:start position:0%
one of which is um as was just said it
 
01:19:30.870 --> 01:19:30.880 align:start position:0%
is a far safer form of
 
01:19:33.709 --> 01:19:33.719 align:start position:0%
hunting using something that has a
 
01:19:35.550 --> 01:19:35.560 align:start position:0%
shoulder stock is is a much better way
 
01:19:37.950 --> 01:19:37.960 align:start position:0%
to ensure bullet placement than with a
 
01:19:40.830 --> 01:19:40.840 align:start position:0%
handgun two the velocities are similar
 
01:19:40.840 --> 01:19:42.910 align:start position:0%
handgun two the velocities are similar
to

01:19:42.910 --> 01:19:42.920 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:19:45.189 --> 01:19:45.199 align:start position:0%
handguns I see this as something that's
 
01:19:48.110 --> 01:19:48.120 align:start position:0%
also valuable to training youth we see a
 
01:19:51.149 --> 01:19:51.159 align:start position:0%
declining enrollment in in hunting and
 
01:19:54.070 --> 01:19:54.080 align:start position:0%
long-term um teaching ing young children
 
01:19:57.470 --> 01:19:57.480 align:start position:0%
to hunt um carbin are the are the ideal
 
01:20:00.910 --> 01:20:00.920 align:start position:0%
first rifle so um this gives them an
 
01:20:02.149 --> 01:20:02.159 align:start position:0%
opportunity to go hunting with their
 
01:20:06.350 --> 01:20:06.360 align:start position:0%
parents um in a controlled way and is
 
01:20:09.229 --> 01:20:09.239 align:start position:0%
just a benefit to all around so I would
 
01:20:12.790 --> 01:20:12.800 align:start position:0%
I stand in favor of this as both um New

came I'll tell you it was terrible we
 
01:21:36.350 --> 01:21:36.360 align:start position:0%
had 200 people
 
01:21:39.550 --> 01:21:39.560 align:start position:0%

it that was good that was very good

I've got nothing against the build but I
 
01:22:39.229 --> 01:22:39.239 align:start position:0%
think like speaker said if you combine
 
01:22:40.950 --> 01:22:40.960 align:start position:0%
them both and have hearings on it give
 
01:22:43.870 --> 01:22:43.880 align:start position:0%
the people an opportunity you
 
01:22:48.590 --> 01:22:48.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:50.550 --> 01:22:50.560 align:start position:0%

something now there's been some push

back I've heard that said you know it's
 
01:30:37.750 --> 01:30:37.760 align:start position:0%
going to beair ADV

Hunter not sure how accurate that is H
 
01:30:44.550 --> 01:30:44.560 align:start position:0%
you know that the first time you step in
 
01:30:48.189 --> 01:30:48.199 align:start position:0%
the woods first 50 break the deer's gone
 
01:30:49.629 --> 01:30:49.639 align:start position:0%
so there's no deer that's going to wait
 
01:30:53.030 --> 01:30:53.040 align:start position:0%
for you at your family also
 
01:30:54.430 --> 01:30:54.440 align:start position:0%

01:30:58.709 --> 01:30:58.719 align:start position:0%
Amendment incrementally introduce this
 
01:31:01.550 --> 01:31:01.560 align:start position:0%
back I would do in favor of that
 
01:31:03.550 --> 01:31:03.560 align:start position:0%
especially with regards to Hunters with
 
01:31:06.790 --> 01:31:06.800 align:start position:0%
disabilities this is a boom for them
 
01:31:08.510 --> 01:31:08.520 align:start position:0%
they can't get out in the woods check G
 
01:31:11.910 --> 01:31:11.920 align:start position:0%
cameras every day um it's very difficult
 
01:31:14.109 --> 01:31:14.119 align:start position:0%
and to let them get those pictures so
 
01:31:17.070 --> 01:31:17.080 align:start position:0%
they know what time and when hand come
 
01:31:19.790 --> 01:31:19.800 align:start position:0%
by is a good
 
01:31:22.669 --> 01:31:22.679 align:start position:0%
idea I would say that majority of game
 
01:31:24.870 --> 01:31:24.880 align:start position:0%
cameras now being sold are sold to the
 
01:31:26.669 --> 01:31:26.679 align:start position:0%
cell their
 
01:31:28.790 --> 01:31:28.800 align:start position:0%
device back when they first came out a
 
01:31:30.790 --> 01:31:30.800 align:start position:0%
decade ago they were just regular
 
01:31:33.629 --> 01:31:33.639 align:start position:0%
cameras you inwards had a motion sensor
 
01:31:37.270 --> 01:31:37.280 align:start position:0%
on it picture the vast majority now are
 
01:31:39.270 --> 01:31:39.280 align:start position:0%
radio Camas will
 
01:31:41.350 --> 01:31:41.360 align:start position:0%
send to
 
01:31:45.030 --> 01:31:45.040 align:start position:0%
cell so the what prompt to do this is is
 
01:31:48.030 --> 01:31:48.040 align:start position:0%
a a question also enforcement
 
01:31:50.149 --> 01:31:50.159 align:start position:0%
perhaps speak
 
01:31:54.030 --> 01:31:54.040 align:start position:0%
this to your camera off
 
01:31:56.910 --> 01:31:56.920 align:start position:0%
most requires you actually taking down
 
01:31:59.270 --> 01:31:59.280 align:start position:0%
most people change their camera to tree
 
01:32:01.149 --> 01:32:01.159 align:start position:0%

01:32:04.310 --> 01:32:04.320 align:start position:0%
Bo well if you're gonna hunt that day
 
01:32:06.189 --> 01:32:06.199 align:start position:0%
you're GNA go out there you have to take
 
01:32:07.750 --> 01:32:07.760 align:start position:0%
it down and shut it off you're make a
 
01:32:07.760 --> 01:32:09.750 align:start position:0%
it down and shut it off you're make a
ret

01:32:09.750 --> 01:32:09.760 align:start position:0%
ret
 
01:32:12.990 --> 01:32:13.000 align:start position:0%
might so the question is how do you how
 
01:32:16.550 --> 01:32:16.560 align:start position:0%
do you enforce whether or not sending
 
01:32:18.270 --> 01:32:18.280 align:start position:0%
pictures to
 
01:32:20.270 --> 01:32:20.280 align:start position:0%
somebody how do you look at it how do
 
01:32:22.709 --> 01:32:22.719 align:start position:0%
you know if the person's got a picture
 
01:32:24.270 --> 01:32:24.280 align:start position:0%
um there's a lot of enforcement
 
01:32:24.280 --> 01:32:25.990 align:start position:0%
um there's a lot of enforcement
questions

01:32:25.990 --> 01:32:26.000 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:32:29.070 --> 01:32:29.080 align:start position:0%
the as far as the disabled HS go I think
 
01:32:32.629 --> 01:32:32.639 align:start position:0%
this is great it sa them
 
01:32:32.639 --> 01:32:34.229 align:start position:0%
this is great it sa them
trips

01:32:34.229 --> 01:32:34.239 align:start position:0%
trips
 
01:32:36.510 --> 01:32:36.520 align:start position:0%
injur to check their
 
01:32:40.629 --> 01:32:40.639 align:start position:0%
cameras and I do not see a downside a
 
01:32:42.350 --> 01:32:42.360 align:start position:0%
population I
 
01:32:47.109 --> 01:32:47.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:50.629 --> 01:32:50.639 align:start position:0%
camera soon as I get anywhere
 
01:33:00.070 --> 01:33:00.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:03.470 --> 01:33:03.480 align:start position:0%
arum representative
 
01:33:06.109 --> 01:33:06.119 align:start position:0%
Harvey so I understand the deer's not
 
01:33:07.950 --> 01:33:07.960 align:start position:0%
going to S sit around and wait for you
 
01:33:09.910 --> 01:33:09.920 align:start position:0%
but then why would you bother with a
 
01:33:12.990 --> 01:33:13.000 align:start position:0%
camera anyway it what good does it do
 
01:33:16.070 --> 01:33:16.080 align:start position:0%
because as soon as it as soon as you get
 
01:33:17.470 --> 01:33:17.480 align:start position:0%
out there as you said you've made noise
 
01:33:19.470 --> 01:33:19.480 align:start position:0%
and it's going to go so except for the
 
01:33:21.030 --> 01:33:21.040 align:start position:0%
disabled Hunters I'm trying to figure
 
01:33:21.040 --> 01:33:22.870 align:start position:0%
disabled Hunters I'm trying to figure
out

01:33:22.870 --> 01:33:22.880 align:start position:0%
out
 
01:33:26.709 --> 01:33:26.719 align:start position:0%
um why why would you bother sure thank
 
01:33:29.350 --> 01:33:29.360 align:start position:0%
question well I guess at that point
 
01:33:30.590 --> 01:33:30.600 align:start position:0%
comes the
 
01:33:33.750 --> 01:33:33.760 align:start position:0%
question all and the point of that is
 
01:33:37.629 --> 01:33:37.639 align:start position:0%
you know about what time the by whether
 
01:33:41.590 --> 01:33:41.600 align:start position:0%
they come at all it giv you a certain
 
01:33:44.870 --> 01:33:44.880 align:start position:0%
Advantage fact when I first start hunted
 
01:33:47.550 --> 01:33:47.560 align:start position:0%
there wasn't thing kind
 
01:33:50.550 --> 01:33:50.560 align:start position:0%
of sign
 
01:33:50.560 --> 01:33:54.130 align:start position:0%
of sign

and followup representative
 
01:34:04.870 --> 01:34:04.880 align:start position:0%
Harvey isn't that the definition of fair
 
01:34:07.990 --> 01:34:08.000 align:start position:0%
Chase well I would suggest the
 
01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:10.030 align:start position:0%
Chase well I would suggest the
definition

01:34:10.030 --> 01:34:10.040 align:start position:0%
definition
 
01:34:13.950 --> 01:34:13.960 align:start position:0%
chases I mean at that point are you g we
 
01:34:20.470 --> 01:34:20.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:20.480 --> 01:34:24.189 align:start position:0%

time by no means guarantees that you're
 
01:34:41.990 --> 01:34:42.000 align:start position:0%
get because once hunting season starts
 
01:34:46.030 --> 01:34:46.040 align:start position:0%
generally CL gets their patterns CH so
 
01:34:47.709 --> 01:34:47.719 align:start position:0%
you can go out and put the game cam they
 
01:34:52.430 --> 01:34:52.440 align:start position:0%
all Su along of the Fall they disaar all

Craig thank you Mr chair thank you
 
01:35:18.550 --> 01:35:18.560 align:start position:0%
representative Roy I am representative
 
01:35:22.590 --> 01:35:22.600 align:start position:0%
Kevin Craig uh would you agree that that
 
01:35:26.390 --> 01:35:26.400 align:start position:0%
the use of game cams in general and of
 
01:35:30.030 --> 01:35:30.040 align:start position:0%
Wireless capable game cams in particular
 
01:35:32.430 --> 01:35:32.440 align:start position:0%
actually minimizes disruption to
 
01:35:35.390 --> 01:35:35.400 align:start position:0%
wildlife in their normal daily patterns
 
01:35:37.550 --> 01:35:37.560 align:start position:0%
by reducing the number of FPS Hunters
 
01:35:39.830 --> 01:35:39.840 align:start position:0%
have to make into the
 
01:35:42.149 --> 01:35:42.159 align:start position:0%
woods thank you for the question yes I
 
01:35:44.709 --> 01:35:44.719 align:start position:0%
would definitely agree with that um when
 
01:35:46.350 --> 01:35:46.360 align:start position:0%
you put up a game
 
01:35:48.750 --> 01:35:48.760 align:start position:0%
camera you're able to especially a
 
01:35:50.830 --> 01:35:50.840 align:start position:0%
wireless one you don't really need to go
 
01:35:54.350 --> 01:35:54.360 align:start position:0%
back out there cost especially during
 
01:35:58.669 --> 01:35:58.679 align:start position:0%
reading season prior to
 
01:36:01.430 --> 01:36:01.440 align:start position:0%
that the impact of environment is much
 
01:36:04.229 --> 01:36:04.239 align:start position:0%
less you have less people in
 
01:36:04.239 --> 01:36:09.950 align:start position:0%
less you have less people in
and

01:36:09.950 --> 01:36:09.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:12.669 --> 01:36:12.679 align:start position:0%
so thank you uh I have a question for
 
01:36:16.030 --> 01:36:16.040 align:start position:0%
you I want to follow up with so would
 
01:36:18.590 --> 01:36:18.600 align:start position:0%
you be opposed um on this current bill
 
01:36:21.470 --> 01:36:21.480 align:start position:0%
it allows for same day taking how
 
01:36:23.870 --> 01:36:23.880 align:start position:0%
however under our current
 
01:36:26.790 --> 01:36:26.800 align:start position:0%
statute sorry give me one
 
01:36:29.310 --> 01:36:29.320 align:start position:0%
second would you agree that this this
 
01:36:31.910 --> 01:36:31.920 align:start position:0%
bill does nothing more than codify uh
 
01:36:34.550 --> 01:36:34.560 align:start position:0%
fishing game section 31204 which is
 
01:36:36.470 --> 01:36:36.480 align:start position:0%
titled live action game cams that says
 
01:36:38.910 --> 01:36:38.920 align:start position:0%
you can only take a deer on the next
 
01:36:41.149 --> 01:36:41.159 align:start position:0%
calendar day not the same calendar day
 
01:36:44.510 --> 01:36:44.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:47.390 --> 01:36:47.400 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
01:36:50.270 --> 01:36:50.280 align:start position:0%
Spain thank you Mr chairman
 
01:36:50.280 --> 01:36:52.669 align:start position:0%
Spain thank you Mr chairman
and

01:36:52.669 --> 01:36:52.679 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:36:54.229 --> 01:36:54.239 align:start position:0%
I thank the member for taking my
 
01:36:57.750 --> 01:36:57.760 align:start position:0%
question um as an archery Hunter and
 
01:36:59.870 --> 01:36:59.880 align:start position:0%
someone who who hunts early in the
 
01:37:01.750 --> 01:37:01.760 align:start position:0%
season straight through into the winter
 
01:37:03.270 --> 01:37:03.280 align:start position:0%
time I understand what you're talking
 
01:37:05.590 --> 01:37:05.600 align:start position:0%
about with changing patterns and things
 
01:37:07.070 --> 01:37:07.080 align:start position:0%
um I
 
01:37:09.510 --> 01:37:09.520 align:start position:0%
found multiple game cameras to be
 
01:37:14.510 --> 01:37:14.520 align:start position:0%
beneficial not so much in uh telling me
 
01:37:17.390 --> 01:37:17.400 align:start position:0%
that a deer is there but in telling me
 
01:37:20.030 --> 01:37:20.040 align:start position:0%
what travel routes are they taking um
 
01:37:24.030 --> 01:37:24.040 align:start position:0%
would you agree that that uh knowing
 
01:37:25.709 --> 01:37:25.719 align:start position:0%
whether it's a buck or a
 
01:37:27.910 --> 01:37:27.920 align:start position:0%
dough is something that's important that
 
01:37:29.750 --> 01:37:29.760 align:start position:0%
you want to know especially when you get
 
01:37:31.830 --> 01:37:31.840 align:start position:0%
into the buck only season you're not
 
01:37:33.310 --> 01:37:33.320 align:start position:0%
wasting your time and it's really
 
01:37:35.189 --> 01:37:35.199 align:start position:0%
difficult to look at a pile of Scat and
 
01:37:37.310 --> 01:37:37.320 align:start position:0%
decide that that's a buck versus a dough
 
01:37:40.870 --> 01:37:40.880 align:start position:0%
or a footprint in the ground um and
 
01:37:42.629 --> 01:37:42.639 align:start position:0%
would you agree that that knowing the
 
01:37:44.589 --> 01:37:44.599 align:start position:0%
travel routes is the primary concern
 
01:37:46.950 --> 01:37:46.960 align:start position:0%
especially when you put the cameras out
 
01:37:49.310 --> 01:37:49.320 align:start position:0%
in very hard to access areas that you
 
01:37:50.550 --> 01:37:50.560 align:start position:0%
don't want to have to travel too
 
01:37:52.990 --> 01:37:53.000 align:start position:0%
frequently and leave a lot of scent
 
01:37:55.030 --> 01:37:55.040 align:start position:0%
around thank you for the
 
01:37:57.390 --> 01:37:57.400 align:start position:0%
questiones I would
 
01:37:59.430 --> 01:37:59.440 align:start position:0%
with there's
 
01:38:03.030 --> 01:38:03.040 align:start position:0%
definitely aside from rugs and trees
 
01:38:06.589 --> 01:38:06.599 align:start position:0%
it's very difficult to tell where bu go
 
01:38:06.599 --> 01:38:07.550 align:start position:0%
it's very difficult to tell where bu go
or

01:38:07.550 --> 01:38:07.560 align:start position:0%
or
 
01:38:11.030 --> 01:38:11.040 align:start position:0%
travel and scraping ground again there's
 
01:38:16.070 --> 01:38:16.080 align:start position:0%
all sign natural sign but
 
01:38:16.080 --> 01:38:18.189 align:start position:0%
all sign natural sign but
especially

01:38:18.189 --> 01:38:18.199 align:start position:0%
especially
 
01:38:21.950 --> 01:38:21.960 align:start position:0%
requ there's another aspect that regards
 
01:38:26.229 --> 01:38:26.239 align:start position:0%
get c a lot of folks hunt areas that are
 
01:38:28.870 --> 01:38:28.880 align:start position:0%
nowhere near the house there's people
 
01:38:33.709 --> 01:38:33.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:38.149 --> 01:38:38.159 align:start position:0%
Norther and it's very imprac possible
 
01:38:41.910 --> 01:38:41.920 align:start position:0%
get to get up there um to check their
 
01:38:44.510 --> 01:38:44.520 align:start position:0%
this allows them to know okay that stand
 
01:38:45.990 --> 01:38:46.000 align:start position:0%
that I've got set up in this particular
 
01:38:49.350 --> 01:38:49.360 align:start position:0%
are pretty active going out of there I
 
01:38:52.910 --> 01:38:52.920 align:start position:0%
can go up there and um verus having to
 
01:38:55.870 --> 01:38:55.880 align:start position:0%
drive all the way up there get the car
 
01:38:57.470 --> 01:38:57.480 align:start position:0%
go back read
 
01:39:01.950 --> 01:39:01.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:06.270 --> 01:39:06.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:08.990 --> 01:39:09.000 align:start position:0%
up I find your your point about uh
 
01:39:10.390 --> 01:39:10.400 align:start position:0%
Southern New Hampshire versus Northern
 
01:39:12.550 --> 01:39:12.560 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire to be fairly compelling
 
01:39:14.629 --> 01:39:14.639 align:start position:0%
but would you then say that this bill is
 
01:39:16.109 --> 01:39:16.119 align:start position:0%
is really a green bill because you're
 
01:39:17.550 --> 01:39:17.560 align:start position:0%
cutting down on the amount of vehicle
 
01:39:20.030 --> 01:39:20.040 align:start position:0%
emissions and driving such long
 
01:39:20.040 --> 01:39:29.750 align:start position:0%
emissions and driving such long
distances

01:39:29.750 --> 01:39:29.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:31.149 --> 01:39:31.159 align:start position:0%
I want to make a clarification because I
 
01:39:33.589 --> 01:39:33.599 align:start position:0%
think I misspoke on my last statement so
 
01:39:35.229 --> 01:39:35.239 align:start position:0%
your bill would allow for the taking of
 
01:39:37.589 --> 01:39:37.599 align:start position:0%
an animal in the same calendar day
 
01:39:40.350 --> 01:39:40.360 align:start position:0%
however the current are the current uh
 
01:39:42.790 --> 01:39:42.800 align:start position:0%
fishing game rule is the next calendar
 
01:39:45.870 --> 01:39:45.880 align:start position:0%
day um so would you be opposed to an
 
01:39:48.070 --> 01:39:48.080 align:start position:0%
amendment that aligned this bill with
 
01:39:49.790 --> 01:39:49.800 align:start position:0%
the current fishing game rule to put it
 
01:39:51.629 --> 01:39:51.639 align:start position:0%
in the statute
 
01:39:51.639 --> 01:39:55.350 align:start position:0%
in the statute
your

01:39:55.350 --> 01:39:55.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:57.510 --> 01:39:57.520 align:start position:0%
question with the exception I would like
 
01:40:02.950 --> 01:40:02.960 align:start position:0%
to see that it CIF that that disabled
 
01:40:09.669 --> 01:40:09.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:11.830 --> 01:40:11.840 align:start position:0%
that I'm sure we'll put Colonel Jordan
 
01:40:13.589 --> 01:40:13.599 align:start position:0%
under the gun to have him answer that
 
01:40:15.629 --> 01:40:15.639 align:start position:0%
question hard to
 
01:40:19.950 --> 01:40:19.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:19.960 --> 01:40:22.669 align:start position:0%
 
Smith

01:40:22.669 --> 01:40:22.679 align:start position:0%
Smith
 
01:40:25.589 --> 01:40:25.599 align:start position:0%
okay this is just a question I guess of
 
01:40:28.390 --> 01:40:28.400 align:start position:0%
clarification um if the game camera took
 
01:40:30.270 --> 01:40:30.280 align:start position:0%
a picture of a six pointer say 10
 
01:40:32.390 --> 01:40:32.400 align:start position:0%
o'clock in the morning um and you
 
01:40:34.669 --> 01:40:34.679 align:start position:0%
decided to go hunt at that stand in that
 
01:40:37.030 --> 01:40:37.040 align:start position:0%
area later that
 
01:40:39.510 --> 01:40:39.520 align:start position:0%
evening uh and a seven-point showed up
 
01:40:41.510 --> 01:40:41.520 align:start position:0%
at that stand but you weren't going to
 
01:40:42.990 --> 01:40:43.000 align:start position:0%
hunt that six-pointer but it later
 
01:40:44.870 --> 01:40:44.880 align:start position:0%
turned out that that six-pointer in the
 
01:40:46.430 --> 01:40:46.440 align:start position:0%
picture was a seven pointer but you
 
01:40:47.870 --> 01:40:47.880 align:start position:0%
really couldn't tell clearly in the
 
01:40:50.189 --> 01:40:50.199 align:start position:0%
picture you then technically would be in
 
01:40:50.199 --> 01:40:51.990 align:start position:0%
picture you then technically would be in
violation

01:40:51.990 --> 01:40:52.000 align:start position:0%
violation
 
01:40:55.070 --> 01:40:55.080 align:start position:0%
uh of the the way the rule sits right
 
01:40:57.229 --> 01:40:57.239 align:start position:0%
now this would actually free up that
 
01:41:00.310 --> 01:41:00.320 align:start position:0%
ability to hunt the same day on a
 
01:41:02.550 --> 01:41:02.560 align:start position:0%
possibly a different deer in the area of
 
01:41:05.310 --> 01:41:05.320 align:start position:0%
that camera correct well it's my
 
01:41:08.390 --> 01:41:08.400 align:start position:0%
understanding repr that the it's not
 
01:41:12.310 --> 01:41:12.320 align:start position:0%
animal specific it's camera specific so
 
01:41:15.070 --> 01:41:15.080 align:start position:0%
if you got a picture of a a six pointer
 
01:41:17.030 --> 01:41:17.040 align:start position:0%
at 7 o00 in the morning you plan on
 
01:41:18.310 --> 01:41:18.320 align:start position:0%
hunting the
 
01:41:21.870 --> 01:41:21.880 align:start position:0%
afternoon um and you went out there hun
 
01:41:24.310 --> 01:41:24.320 align:start position:0%
and the Seven pointer was there eight
 
01:41:27.950 --> 01:41:27.960 align:start position:0%
pointer go you still be invit hunting
 
01:41:31.470 --> 01:41:31.480 align:start position:0%
over the was active that day so it
 
01:41:34.470 --> 01:41:34.480 align:start position:0%
doesn't differentiate byat by the Cera
 
01:41:36.430 --> 01:41:36.440 align:start position:0%
itself which brought me back to my
 
01:41:38.830 --> 01:41:38.840 align:start position:0%
question I'm not
 
01:41:43.750 --> 01:41:43.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:43.760 --> 01:41:47.390 align:start position:0%
 
take

01:41:47.390 --> 01:41:47.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:49.070 --> 01:41:49.080 align:start position:0%
I thank
 
01:41:51.750 --> 01:41:51.760 align:start position:0%
you any further questions for
 
01:41:51.760 --> 01:41:54.189 align:start position:0%

Hampshire as an organization we do not
 
01:42:35.030 --> 01:42:35.040 align:start position:0%
have a position on liveaction game
 
01:42:37.870 --> 01:42:37.880 align:start position:0%
cameras our opposition to the bill stems
 
01:42:39.669 --> 01:42:39.679 align:start position:0%
from the lack of a requirement for
 
01:42:41.790 --> 01:42:41.800 align:start position:0%
written landowner
 
01:42:44.070 --> 01:42:44.080 align:start position:0%
permission we ask whether or not the
 
01:42:45.830 --> 01:42:45.840 align:start position:0%
committee move forward with the
 
01:42:48.390 --> 01:42:48.400 align:start position:0%
liveaction language you move forward
 
01:42:50.790 --> 01:42:50.800 align:start position:0%
with an amendment making it clear in
 
01:42:52.070 --> 01:42:52.080 align:start position:0%
statute that written landowner
 
01:42:54.790 --> 01:42:54.800 align:start position:0%
permission is required to place cameras
 
01:42:57.189 --> 01:42:57.199 align:start position:0%
and electronic surveillance equipment on
 
01:43:00.030 --> 01:43:00.040 align:start position:0%
private property the state of Maine has
 
01:43:02.550 --> 01:43:02.560 align:start position:0%
such a law and has since for the last
 
01:43:05.030 --> 01:43:05.040 align:start position:0%
seven years I believe it was 2013 when
 
01:43:07.790 --> 01:43:07.800 align:start position:0%
it was passed to give you some briefs on
 
01:43:10.629 --> 01:43:10.639 align:start position:0%
the the law in Maine let me let me read
 
01:43:13.350 --> 01:43:13.360 align:start position:0%
that it reads and I I'm quoting
 
01:43:16.030 --> 01:43:16.040 align:start position:0%
prohibition any person may not place a
 
01:43:17.910 --> 01:43:17.920 align:start position:0%
camera or electronic surveillance
 
01:43:20.790 --> 01:43:20.800 align:start position:0%
equipment that records images or data of
 
01:43:23.870 --> 01:43:23.880 align:start position:0%
any kind while unattended outside on the
 
01:43:26.430 --> 01:43:26.440 align:start position:0%
private property of another without the
 
01:43:28.870 --> 01:43:28.880 align:start position:0%
written consent of the land owner unless
 
01:43:30.750 --> 01:43:30.760 align:start position:0%
the placement isn't pursuant to a
 
01:43:33.149 --> 01:43:33.159 align:start position:0%
warrant it also contains language
 
01:43:35.790 --> 01:43:35.800 align:start position:0%
requiring that the cameras be labeled
 
01:43:38.390 --> 01:43:38.400 align:start position:0%
with the owner's name and contact
 
01:43:40.790 --> 01:43:40.800 align:start position:0%
information it also contains language
 
01:43:44.470 --> 01:43:44.480 align:start position:0%
require allowing that the land owner uh
 
01:43:48.589 --> 01:43:48.599 align:start position:0%
um remove or disable a camera uh if it
 
01:43:51.030 --> 01:43:51.040 align:start position:0%
is placed on property in violation of
 
01:43:54.270 --> 01:43:54.280 align:start position:0%
the of the section it also includes a
 
01:43:56.990 --> 01:43:57.000 align:start position:0%
couple of exemptions that I guess I'd
 
01:43:58.149 --> 01:43:58.159 align:start position:0%
say that we're not clear that they're
 
01:44:00.270 --> 01:44:00.280 align:start position:0%
necessary but it's there are exemptions
 
01:44:02.790 --> 01:44:02.800 align:start position:0%
that would allow the use of a camera to
 
01:44:04.870 --> 01:44:04.880 align:start position:0%
deter theft or vandalism of a motor
 
01:44:07.030 --> 01:44:07.040 align:start position:0%
vehicle when the the vehicle is
 
01:44:10.310 --> 01:44:10.320 align:start position:0%
temporarily parked as well as as it has
 
01:44:13.030 --> 01:44:13.040 align:start position:0%
language relative to the uh the use of
 
01:44:16.629 --> 01:44:16.639 align:start position:0%
implants to a um uh on uh I believe it's
 
01:44:19.390 --> 01:44:19.400 align:start position:0%
on wild animals to monitor uh animals I
 
01:44:20.950 --> 01:44:20.960 align:start position:0%
guess it would be that would be
 
01:44:23.030 --> 01:44:23.040 align:start position:0%
something maybe in in pursuit of a a
 
01:44:27.550 --> 01:44:27.560 align:start position:0%
fishing game um uh then then also um
 
01:44:31.669 --> 01:44:31.679 align:start position:0%
there is there's uh uh the penalty is is
 
01:44:35.270 --> 01:44:35.280 align:start position:0%
for any person violating uh is a fine of
 
01:44:36.589 --> 01:44:36.599 align:start position:0%
not more than
 
01:44:39.830 --> 01:44:39.840 align:start position:0%
$500 maybe maybe maybe
 
01:44:43.669 --> 01:44:43.679 align:start position:0%
levied this is an issue that has that we
 
01:44:46.830 --> 01:44:46.840 align:start position:0%
as as land owners are increasingly
 
01:44:49.950 --> 01:44:49.960 align:start position:0%
facing and quite frankly uh our our
 
01:44:52.350 --> 01:44:52.360 align:start position:0%
members find find it unconscionable that
 
01:44:54.470 --> 01:44:54.480 align:start position:0%
that cameras are placed on on our
 
01:44:57.229 --> 01:44:57.239 align:start position:0%
property on Prop without without
 
01:44:59.750 --> 01:44:59.760 align:start position:0%
permission there's the there's a term uh
 
01:45:04.470 --> 01:45:04.480 align:start position:0%
the term private uh uh property uh is
 
01:45:07.109 --> 01:45:07.119 align:start position:0%
used for a reason Mr chair I'll leave it
 
01:45:08.669 --> 01:45:08.679 align:start position:0%
at that we thank you for your time and
 
01:45:10.390 --> 01:45:10.400 align:start position:0%
attention as always and I'll be happy to
 
01:45:12.189 --> 01:45:12.199 align:start position:0%
try to answer any
 
01:45:14.189 --> 01:45:14.199 align:start position:0%
questions thank you Mr Johnson any
 
01:45:18.629 --> 01:45:18.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:21.629 --> 01:45:21.639 align:start position:0%
Johnson don't bother
 
01:45:25.830 --> 01:45:25.840 align:start position:0%
conc got kind of used to that I do
 
01:45:28.430 --> 01:45:28.440 align:start position:0%
disagree with represent Spain on this
 
01:45:30.750 --> 01:45:30.760 align:start position:0%
bill and and I I got some reasons here
 
01:45:32.790 --> 01:45:32.800 align:start position:0%
that I'll U hopefully be able to
 
01:45:34.310 --> 01:45:34.320 align:start position:0%
communicate effectively one thing I want
 
01:45:37.790 --> 01:45:37.800 align:start position:0%
to point out this is a particular
 
01:45:40.030 --> 01:45:40.040 align:start position:0%
situation where we don't have a law that
 
01:45:41.990 --> 01:45:42.000 align:start position:0%
addresses this so this was addressed in
 
01:45:45.589 --> 01:45:45.599 align:start position:0%
rule as a manner of tap um our position
 
01:45:45.599 --> 01:45:46.629 align:start position:0%
rule as a manner of tap um our position
is

01:45:46.629 --> 01:45:46.639 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:45:49.510 --> 01:45:49.520 align:start position:0%
always uh we try to preserve that for
 
01:45:51.910 --> 01:45:51.920 align:start position:0%
the reasons I stated i w St it again but
 
01:45:53.830 --> 01:45:53.840 align:start position:0%
it's an easier way to control this so I
 
01:45:55.990 --> 01:45:56.000 align:start position:0%
would ask no matter what we do here
 
01:45:57.629 --> 01:45:57.639 align:start position:0%
that's the better way to go because if
 
01:45:59.470 --> 01:45:59.480 align:start position:0%
this requires change later doing it
 
01:46:02.510 --> 01:46:02.520 align:start position:0%
legislative and present challenges so if
 
01:46:04.270 --> 01:46:04.280 align:start position:0%
it isn't working sometimes you have to
 
01:46:06.790 --> 01:46:06.800 align:start position:0%
wait two years before you get back in so
 
01:46:09.990 --> 01:46:10.000 align:start position:0%
the r faster
 
01:46:13.830 --> 01:46:13.840 align:start position:0%
um so we we looked at this when this
 
01:46:17.390 --> 01:46:17.400 align:start position:0%
first came out I think in 2015 and we uh
 
01:46:19.830 --> 01:46:19.840 align:start position:0%
we get a lot of complaints like the farm
 
01:46:21.709 --> 01:46:21.719 align:start position:0%
deer like has stated I get a lot of
 
01:46:23.470 --> 01:46:23.480 align:start position:0%
complaints from land owners who get a
 
01:46:24.950 --> 01:46:24.960 align:start position:0%
little on edge when they're out on their
 
01:46:27.189 --> 01:46:27.199 align:start position:0%
property suddenly there's a camera there
 
01:46:29.790 --> 01:46:29.800 align:start position:0%
taking photos of so I have been
 
01:46:31.709 --> 01:46:31.719 align:start position:0%
approached on more than one occasion by
 
01:46:33.430 --> 01:46:33.440 align:start position:0%
land owners saying why don't we have law
 
01:46:35.470 --> 01:46:35.480 align:start position:0%
hand makes people get permission for
 
01:46:38.470 --> 01:46:38.480 align:start position:0%
that we have a law that says you have to
 
01:46:40.229 --> 01:46:40.239 align:start position:0%
have permission to bait on someone
 
01:46:41.830 --> 01:46:41.840 align:start position:0%
else's property a lot of times these
 
01:46:44.990 --> 01:46:45.000 align:start position:0%
cameras are used during the act of bait
 
01:46:46.830 --> 01:46:46.840 align:start position:0%
um not always but a lot of times they
 
01:46:48.750 --> 01:46:48.760 align:start position:0%
are that's where I see the majority of
 
01:46:51.669 --> 01:46:51.679 align:start position:0%
them so but there isn't a requirement
 
01:46:54.510 --> 01:46:54.520 align:start position:0%
for a camera to have permission for a
 
01:46:55.750 --> 01:46:55.760 align:start position:0%
camera but I can understand the
 
01:46:57.709 --> 01:46:57.719 align:start position:0%
landowner I would I would not be
 
01:46:59.270 --> 01:46:59.280 align:start position:0%
comfortable being on my own property
 
01:47:00.910 --> 01:47:00.920 align:start position:0%
knowing my photos is being taken and
 
01:47:02.790 --> 01:47:02.800 align:start position:0%
sent to someone I do not know without my
 
01:47:05.750 --> 01:47:05.760 align:start position:0%
knowledge permission PR to that's me
 
01:47:08.830 --> 01:47:08.840 align:start position:0%
personally we're not advocating that um
 
01:47:11.149 --> 01:47:11.159 align:start position:0%
but it's a point that the F has raised
 
01:47:14.750 --> 01:47:14.760 align:start position:0%
and certainly one I have heard before we
 
01:47:17.629 --> 01:47:17.639 align:start position:0%
we felt that we needed to take steps to
 
01:47:19.229 --> 01:47:19.239 align:start position:0%
do something against this because as
 
01:47:22.030 --> 01:47:22.040 align:start position:0%
technology Contin to advance we talked
 
01:47:23.350 --> 01:47:23.360 align:start position:0%
about it earlier today we were talking
 
01:47:25.510 --> 01:47:25.520 align:start position:0%
about the advances puzzle ERS shotguns
 
01:47:27.430 --> 01:47:27.440 align:start position:0%
as we continue to advance I guess the
 
01:47:30.310 --> 01:47:30.320 align:start position:0%
question becomes for my agency at what
 
01:47:32.390 --> 01:47:32.400 align:start position:0%
point does it stop at what point do we
 
01:47:36.350 --> 01:47:36.360 align:start position:0%
say that's just a little too much now we
 
01:47:38.189 --> 01:47:38.199 align:start position:0%
have a camera that will and what people
 
01:47:39.629 --> 01:47:39.639 align:start position:0%
were doing with
 
01:47:43.229 --> 01:47:43.239 align:start position:0%
this not every again not everyone but we
 
01:47:44.990 --> 01:47:45.000 align:start position:0%
made several cases where people were
 
01:47:46.470 --> 01:47:46.480 align:start position:0%
setting up dates in their backyard
 
01:47:47.950 --> 01:47:47.960 align:start position:0%
sitting in their homes waiting for the
 
01:47:50.550 --> 01:47:50.560 align:start position:0%
year to come they saw the de was there
 
01:47:53.550 --> 01:47:53.560 align:start position:0%
back sh de that was happening a lot and
 
01:47:55.589 --> 01:47:55.599 align:start position:0%
so you know what's next are we going to
 
01:47:57.109 --> 01:47:57.119 align:start position:0%
have are we going to have a drone that
 
01:47:58.550 --> 01:47:58.560 align:start position:0%
flies around with a rifle line so we
 
01:48:00.270 --> 01:48:00.280 align:start position:0%
don't to leave the house of Hall just
 
01:48:01.910 --> 01:48:01.920 align:start position:0%
can spot the deer and shoot it with a
 
01:48:05.910 --> 01:48:05.920 align:start position:0%
drone I just feel like the principles of
 
01:48:09.390 --> 01:48:09.400 align:start position:0%
fair Chase are an important factor here
 
01:48:11.709 --> 01:48:11.719 align:start position:0%
and as Sportsman and I am a sportsman
 
01:48:14.910 --> 01:48:14.920 align:start position:0%
Hunter long time lifetime Hunter uh we
 
01:48:16.669 --> 01:48:16.679 align:start position:0%
need to protect them because that's
 
01:48:18.629 --> 01:48:18.639 align:start position:0%
exactly what people that don't want us
 
01:48:21.390 --> 01:48:21.400 align:start position:0%
hunting tradition attack uh and the fair
 
01:48:24.229 --> 01:48:24.239 align:start position:0%
Chase principles uh really if you if
 
01:48:27.350 --> 01:48:27.360 align:start position:0%
you're not willing to support that
 
01:48:29.109 --> 01:48:29.119 align:start position:0%
understand those and support that and
 
01:48:31.229 --> 01:48:31.239 align:start position:0%
we've kind of lost touch of what hunting
 
01:48:33.470 --> 01:48:33.480 align:start position:0%
and fishing should be part of hunting
 
01:48:36.149 --> 01:48:36.159 align:start position:0%
and fishing in my opinion isn't we we've
 
01:48:39.189 --> 01:48:39.199 align:start position:0%
gotten way the society has and I'm sorry
 
01:48:41.390 --> 01:48:41.400 align:start position:0%
I'm getting on my board here but but I
 
01:48:43.390 --> 01:48:43.400 align:start position:0%
think it's an important fact Mr chairman
 
01:48:45.629 --> 01:48:45.639 align:start position:0%
the people we've gotten away from the
 
01:48:47.669 --> 01:48:47.679 align:start position:0%
experience of hunting and we've changed
 
01:48:50.470 --> 01:48:50.480 align:start position:0%
that into the experience of taking we
 
01:48:52.550 --> 01:48:52.560 align:start position:0%
didn't we term a successful hunt and I
 
01:48:54.270 --> 01:48:54.280 align:start position:0%
lecture Hunters especially young Hunters
 
01:48:55.629 --> 01:48:55.639 align:start position:0%
about this all the time a successful
 
01:48:57.310 --> 01:48:57.320 align:start position:0%
hunt isn't an eight point buck on your
 
01:48:59.870 --> 01:48:59.880 align:start position:0%
ti a successful Hunt is the ones that I
 
01:49:02.629 --> 01:49:02.639 align:start position:0%
do where I go out away from my pager
 
01:49:04.430 --> 01:49:04.440 align:start position:0%
away from my cell phone away from the
 
01:49:06.430 --> 01:49:06.440 align:start position:0%
people in general and have a little
 
01:49:08.990 --> 01:49:09.000 align:start position:0%
peace and and quiet and enjoy nature I
 
01:49:10.790 --> 01:49:10.800 align:start position:0%
may see three deer that I don't shoot
 
01:49:14.149 --> 01:49:14.159 align:start position:0%
because I won't shoot adult that is the
 
01:49:16.750 --> 01:49:16.760 align:start position:0%
joy of hunting and and this technology
 
01:49:19.470 --> 01:49:19.480 align:start position:0%
continues to advance us to enhance our
 
01:49:21.910 --> 01:49:21.920 align:start position:0%
abilities speed them up make them more
 
01:49:24.350 --> 01:49:24.360 align:start position:0%
effective in the effort of tap that's a
 
01:49:26.750 --> 01:49:26.760 align:start position:0%
mistake if you're a sportsman and you
 
01:49:28.709 --> 01:49:28.719 align:start position:0%
think your future is bright by going in
 
01:49:30.470 --> 01:49:30.480 align:start position:0%
that direction and making a mistake it
 
01:49:32.189 --> 01:49:32.199 align:start position:0%
is not that is exactly how we're going
 
01:49:34.750 --> 01:49:34.760 align:start position:0%
to lose it uh the North American
 
01:49:37.229 --> 01:49:37.239 align:start position:0%
wildlife model that we all subscribe to
 
01:49:40.229 --> 01:49:40.239 align:start position:0%
or should as Sportsman would be appalled
 
01:49:42.270 --> 01:49:42.280 align:start position:0%
by this these kinds of this kind of
 
01:49:46.149 --> 01:49:46.159 align:start position:0%
technology I um you know a camera I'm
 
01:49:48.390 --> 01:49:48.400 align:start position:0%
not even a fan of the camera I'm kind of
 
01:49:50.310 --> 01:49:50.320 align:start position:0%
an old traditionalist uh when when you
 
01:49:51.669 --> 01:49:51.679 align:start position:0%
ask the question should we go back to a
 
01:49:53.589 --> 01:49:53.599 align:start position:0%
bow and arrow well in some instances yes
 
01:49:55.510 --> 01:49:55.520 align:start position:0%
we should go back to a bow and arrow I
 
01:49:58.070 --> 01:49:58.080 align:start position:0%
think crossbows I we've got crossbows
 
01:49:59.709 --> 01:49:59.719 align:start position:0%
coming that are going to shoot two bolts
 
01:50:01.709 --> 01:50:01.719 align:start position:0%
we've got muzzle loaders that shoot
 
01:50:03.350 --> 01:50:03.360 align:start position:0%
rifle rounds we you know there was a
 
01:50:05.109 --> 01:50:05.119 align:start position:0%
time when a muzzle loader you didn't
 
01:50:06.990 --> 01:50:07.000 align:start position:0%
have a scope on You Had A Hammer Flint
 
01:50:09.189 --> 01:50:09.199 align:start position:0%
Lo now you got Scopes you inlines you
 
01:50:11.550 --> 01:50:11.560 align:start position:0%
got it just going we're advancing and
 
01:50:13.189 --> 01:50:13.199 align:start position:0%
advancing and advancing and at some
 
01:50:15.310 --> 01:50:15.320 align:start position:0%
point you have to step back and say okay
 
01:50:18.189 --> 01:50:18.199 align:start position:0%
so when is it not appr and we felt these
 
01:50:22.109 --> 01:50:22.119 align:start position:0%
liveaction Camas would the first step we
 
01:50:24.589 --> 01:50:24.599 align:start position:0%
do make cases on them I think the guys
 
01:50:26.629 --> 01:50:26.639 align:start position:0%
and I I have never made case on because
 
01:50:28.830 --> 01:50:28.840 align:start position:0%
they came out after I stopped becoming a
 
01:50:30.470 --> 01:50:30.480 align:start position:0%
real game Mor and was pushed into an
 
01:50:33.229 --> 01:50:33.239 align:start position:0%
office but but I have seen tickets and
 
01:50:34.550 --> 01:50:34.560 align:start position:0%
cases where the guys have made him and
 
01:50:35.910 --> 01:50:35.920 align:start position:0%
I'm assuming they're making through
 
01:50:37.669 --> 01:50:37.679 align:start position:0%
inter they're making them and quite
 
01:50:41.030 --> 01:50:41.040 align:start position:0%
frankly they're always related to weate
 
01:50:43.950 --> 01:50:43.960 align:start position:0%
and they're tied into action so and and
 
01:50:45.669 --> 01:50:45.679 align:start position:0%
just think for a moment and I remember
 
01:50:47.550 --> 01:50:47.560 align:start position:0%
there's no one in this room that I think
 
01:50:51.350 --> 01:50:51.360 align:start position:0%
fits this m and I say otherwise quite
 
01:50:54.629 --> 01:50:54.639 align:start position:0%
frankly um but if you put out an illegal
 
01:50:56.950 --> 01:50:56.960 align:start position:0%
bait this would be your camera because
 
01:50:59.109 --> 01:50:59.119 align:start position:0%
you would know instantly someone has
 
01:51:01.390 --> 01:51:01.400 align:start position:0%
discovered um and so it's used in that
 
01:51:04.229 --> 01:51:04.239 align:start position:0%
regard as well so I don't have a problem
 
01:51:05.750 --> 01:51:05.760 align:start position:0%
with the camera itself I think it's a
 
01:51:08.189 --> 01:51:08.199 align:start position:0%
great tool they take great pictures the
 
01:51:10.030 --> 01:51:10.040 align:start position:0%
the other thing that Paul submitted to
 
01:51:11.910 --> 01:51:11.920 align:start position:0%
you in writing that I I would strongly
 
01:51:13.510 --> 01:51:13.520 align:start position:0%
suggest you read is he gave you some
 
01:51:15.189 --> 01:51:15.199 align:start position:0%
examples of some of the technology right
 
01:51:18.069 --> 01:51:18.079 align:start position:0%
off the ad ads on the website of how
 
01:51:19.550 --> 01:51:19.560 align:start position:0%
these things are advancing these cameras
 
01:51:22.310 --> 01:51:22.320 align:start position:0%
you can have 16 of these cameras tied
 
01:51:24.629 --> 01:51:24.639 align:start position:0%
together and lock in a Four Mile area
 
01:51:26.430 --> 01:51:26.440 align:start position:0%
that will send pictures within a four M
 
01:51:28.510 --> 01:51:28.520 align:start position:0%
square area of your hunting spot without
 
01:51:31.109 --> 01:51:31.119 align:start position:0%
you ever leaving your home that's ladies
 
01:51:32.910 --> 01:51:32.920 align:start position:0%
and gentlemen is about as far away from
 
01:51:35.430 --> 01:51:35.440 align:start position:0%
Fair Chase andics as you can as far as
 
01:51:37.069 --> 01:51:37.079 align:start position:0%
I'm concerned so I don't want us
 
01:51:38.990 --> 01:51:39.000 align:start position:0%
teaching our kids that I don't want them
 
01:51:40.390 --> 01:51:40.400 align:start position:0%
to understand that's the best way to
 
01:51:44.310 --> 01:51:44.320 align:start position:0%
hunt um I want us to not lose side of
 
01:51:46.069 --> 01:51:46.079 align:start position:0%
the fact whole fun of hunting is to get
 
01:51:47.830 --> 01:51:47.840 align:start position:0%
out there outsmart the animal and yeah
 
01:51:50.069 --> 01:51:50.079 align:start position:0%
worry about your scent and take steps to
 
01:51:52.430 --> 01:51:52.440 align:start position:0%
avoid that and harvest be I have never
 
01:51:54.229 --> 01:51:54.239 align:start position:0%
put a game camera out and I've never had
 
01:51:56.990 --> 01:51:57.000 align:start position:0%
a season I haven't harvested nice so I'm
 
01:51:58.669 --> 01:51:58.679 align:start position:0%
living proof it can be done and I'm no
 
01:52:01.870 --> 01:52:01.880 align:start position:0%
expert so uh as far as handicap Hunters
 
01:52:04.510 --> 01:52:04.520 align:start position:0%
go you know this enhancing that we do an
 
01:52:06.149 --> 01:52:06.159 align:start position:0%
awful lot as an agency because who
 
01:52:08.589 --> 01:52:08.599 align:start position:0%
receive federal money required to have a
 
01:52:11.149 --> 01:52:11.159 align:start position:0%
whole section of rules under chapter 900
 
01:52:13.030 --> 01:52:13.040 align:start position:0%
that accommodates those folks we give
 
01:52:14.990 --> 01:52:15.000 align:start position:0%
them we expend the dating season for
 
01:52:17.149 --> 01:52:17.159 align:start position:0%
them we give them special privileges
 
01:52:18.990 --> 01:52:19.000 align:start position:0%
upon their request if we can do it to
 
01:52:21.790 --> 01:52:21.800 align:start position:0%
allow for over land transportation to
 
01:52:24.030 --> 01:52:24.040 align:start position:0%
get in and out of these areas and the
 
01:52:25.550 --> 01:52:25.560 align:start position:0%
argument that these are going to help
 
01:52:27.270 --> 01:52:27.280 align:start position:0%
them they still if they want to harvest
 
01:52:28.629 --> 01:52:28.639 align:start position:0%
an an they still got to get out where
 
01:52:31.430 --> 01:52:31.440 align:start position:0%
this just so if you got to do that
 
01:52:34.109 --> 01:52:34.119 align:start position:0%
you're gonna be out where the C and so
 
01:52:36.270 --> 01:52:36.280 align:start position:0%
the need for that I don't other than you
 
01:52:38.109 --> 01:52:38.119 align:start position:0%
could sit in a warm place and full of VI
 
01:52:39.910 --> 01:52:39.920 align:start position:0%
gets there you know what time it was I
 
01:52:42.790 --> 01:52:42.800 align:start position:0%
guess but again that's that to me is why
 
01:52:48.030 --> 01:52:48.040 align:start position:0%
I face so for all those reasons um if if
 
01:52:49.390 --> 01:52:49.400 align:start position:0%
it does go forward if the committee
 
01:52:50.990 --> 01:52:51.000 align:start position:0%
thinks it's okay and we're going to push
 
01:52:52.270 --> 01:52:52.280 align:start position:0%
it forward we would encourage you to do
 
01:52:54.470 --> 01:52:54.480 align:start position:0%
it within rule um we would also
 
01:52:56.030 --> 01:52:56.040 align:start position:0%
encourage you not to allow the taking of
 
01:52:59.109 --> 01:52:59.119 align:start position:0%
the game the same day um because again
 
01:53:00.870 --> 01:53:00.880 align:start position:0%
that's that's what people were doing
 
01:53:03.350 --> 01:53:03.360 align:start position:0%
with it and I ask you to strongly
 
01:53:04.950 --> 01:53:04.960 align:start position:0%
consider the farm bureau's concern
 
01:53:07.390 --> 01:53:07.400 align:start position:0%
because that is a lot of our open land
 
01:53:09.069 --> 01:53:09.079 align:start position:0%
and if we got land owners pushing back
 
01:53:11.149 --> 01:53:11.159 align:start position:0%
we need to be we need to be aware of
 
01:53:13.470 --> 01:53:13.480 align:start position:0%
that and willing to
 
01:53:16.069 --> 01:53:16.079 align:start position:0%
address hopefully I didn't make
 
01:53:18.629 --> 01:53:18.639 align:start position:0%
anybody you're fine Colonel um
 
01:53:24.310 --> 01:53:24.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:26.229 --> 01:53:26.239 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you Colonel
 
01:53:28.790 --> 01:53:28.800 align:start position:0%
Jordan for taking my questions um I'll
 
01:53:32.870 --> 01:53:32.880 align:start position:0%
start out first by asking you you you
 
01:53:34.870 --> 01:53:34.880 align:start position:0%
mentioned that people were using these
 
01:53:36.750 --> 01:53:36.760 align:start position:0%
in their backyards so they could see the
 
01:53:38.669 --> 01:53:38.679 align:start position:0%
deer come and then run outside and shoot
 
01:53:41.510 --> 01:53:41.520 align:start position:0%
it if that's the case wouldn't it be
 
01:53:42.990 --> 01:53:43.000 align:start position:0%
more efficient for them to use a home
 
01:53:44.470 --> 01:53:44.480 align:start position:0%
security camera mounted on the back of
 
01:53:46.709 --> 01:53:46.719 align:start position:0%
the house as I've got on my house and
 
01:53:49.189 --> 01:53:49.199 align:start position:0%
then this there's no violation against
 
01:53:50.629 --> 01:53:50.639 align:start position:0%
that because there's nothing in the
 
01:53:52.149 --> 01:53:52.159 align:start position:0%
statute that says you can't use a home
 
01:53:55.149 --> 01:53:55.159 align:start position:0%
security camera to monitor your property
 
01:53:57.229 --> 01:53:57.239 align:start position:0%
and you're still accomplishing the same
 
01:53:59.510 --> 01:53:59.520 align:start position:0%
thing you are as long as that bait is
 
01:54:00.629 --> 01:54:00.639 align:start position:0%
the only thing I would say about home
 
01:54:02.430 --> 01:54:02.440 align:start position:0%
security is that would probably require
 
01:54:04.430 --> 01:54:04.440 align:start position:0%
that the bait closer to the home we do
 
01:54:06.709 --> 01:54:06.719 align:start position:0%
have regulations for that so it'll be
 
01:54:10.069 --> 01:54:10.079 align:start position:0%
harder to do but I'm sure people do that
 
01:54:11.990 --> 01:54:12.000 align:start position:0%
I don't want to make it easier for is
 
01:54:13.910 --> 01:54:13.920 align:start position:0%
what I'm saying I have a wireless camera
 
01:54:15.669 --> 01:54:15.679 align:start position:0%
that sits way out at my chicken coup
 
01:54:19.430 --> 01:54:19.440 align:start position:0%
just so you know follow follow up I have
 
01:54:21.470 --> 01:54:21.480 align:start position:0%
another question does fishing game not
 
01:54:23.629 --> 01:54:23.639 align:start position:0%
use these cameras for law enforcement we
 
01:54:26.189 --> 01:54:26.199 align:start position:0%
do not we well I shouldn't say we did
 
01:54:29.510 --> 01:54:29.520 align:start position:0%
use them on the coast for the elvers yes
 
01:54:34.030 --> 01:54:34.040 align:start position:0%
when we had a rampage of el poaching if
 
01:54:36.149 --> 01:54:36.159 align:start position:0%
you remember that the market we did use
 
01:54:38.510 --> 01:54:38.520 align:start position:0%
that because it was safer than having
 
01:54:40.229 --> 01:54:40.239 align:start position:0%
offers sit out there in the dark it was
 
01:54:41.589 --> 01:54:41.599 align:start position:0%
safer to have a camera and they had
 
01:54:43.790 --> 01:54:43.800 align:start position:0%
knowledge prior to getting there who was
 
01:54:46.870 --> 01:54:46.880 align:start position:0%
there so yes we did use them to wa we
 
01:54:49.229 --> 01:54:49.239 align:start position:0%
don't we're not using them commonly now
 
01:54:51.709 --> 01:54:51.719 align:start position:0%
because quite frankly they're expensive
 
01:54:54.350 --> 01:54:54.360 align:start position:0%
the data fee for sending that data is
 
01:54:56.030 --> 01:54:56.040 align:start position:0%
expensive so I don't allow them to be
 
01:55:00.390 --> 01:55:00.400 align:start position:0%
used unless we're in with the older
 
01:55:02.430 --> 01:55:02.440 align:start position:0%
situation that's that you bring up
 
01:55:04.350 --> 01:55:04.360 align:start position:0%
another Val point I didn't touch you on
 
01:55:05.950 --> 01:55:05.960 align:start position:0%
I'm a
 
01:55:08.750 --> 01:55:08.760 align:start position:0%
little okay I'm a little hinky about
 
01:55:12.030 --> 01:55:12.040 align:start position:0%
them as well due to officer I'm not real
 
01:55:14.629 --> 01:55:14.639 align:start position:0%
comfortable with my officers going out
 
01:55:16.390 --> 01:55:16.400 align:start position:0%
in the woods to check a DAT site and
 
01:55:18.589 --> 01:55:18.599 align:start position:0%
being photographed instantly and sent to
 
01:55:20.390 --> 01:55:20.400 align:start position:0%
someone so that they have the ability to
 
01:55:22.750 --> 01:55:22.760 align:start position:0%
know the officers there at that moment
 
01:55:24.629 --> 01:55:24.639 align:start position:0%
I'm not real comfortable with that so
 
01:55:28.950 --> 01:55:28.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:32.149 --> 01:55:32.159 align:start position:0%
for I think that could be an issue
 
01:55:34.629 --> 01:55:34.639 align:start position:0%
followup question representa
 
01:55:36.750 --> 01:55:36.760 align:start position:0%
Spain thank you again and thank you
 
01:55:39.109 --> 01:55:39.119 align:start position:0%
again um my final question touches on
 
01:55:42.350 --> 01:55:42.360 align:start position:0%
the disabilities aspect um you had
 
01:55:44.390 --> 01:55:44.400 align:start position:0%
mentioned that uh you'd like to keep
 
01:55:46.390 --> 01:55:46.400 align:start position:0%
this whole thing um it actually touches
 
01:55:47.830 --> 01:55:47.840 align:start position:0%
on the disabilities and Farm Bureau
 
01:55:49.629 --> 01:55:49.639 align:start position:0%
because you mentioned those together uh
 
01:55:51.910 --> 01:55:51.920 align:start position:0%
those concerns um you mentioned you'd
 
01:55:53.709 --> 01:55:53.719 align:start position:0%
rather keep it in rules because that's
 
01:55:55.910 --> 01:55:55.920 align:start position:0%
where things could be changed quickly
 
01:55:59.350 --> 01:55:59.360 align:start position:0%
couldn't you currently cautify that
 
01:56:01.910 --> 01:56:01.920 align:start position:0%
disabled people have the ability to use
 
01:56:03.669 --> 01:56:03.679 align:start position:0%
these cameras when they have a mobility
 
01:56:06.870 --> 01:56:06.880 align:start position:0%
issue and put that in rules and also
 
01:56:08.750 --> 01:56:08.760 align:start position:0%
address the situation with needing L
 
01:56:10.510 --> 01:56:10.520 align:start position:0%
written land owner permission for camera
 
01:56:13.149 --> 01:56:13.159 align:start position:0%
placement in rules the same way as uh
 
01:56:15.669 --> 01:56:15.679 align:start position:0%
tree STS that pump that penetrate a tree
 
01:56:17.430 --> 01:56:17.440 align:start position:0%
is in rules for written landowner
 
01:56:20.669 --> 01:56:20.679 align:start position:0%
permission Etc all of that could
 
01:56:24.390 --> 01:56:24.400 align:start position:0%
yes follow real quick last followup can
 
01:56:25.950 --> 01:56:25.960 align:start position:0%
I ask why that hasn't been done yet as
 
01:56:27.669 --> 01:56:27.679 align:start position:0%
far as written landowner permission for
 
01:56:30.270 --> 01:56:30.280 align:start position:0%
camera placement sure uh written L for
 
01:56:32.830 --> 01:56:32.840 align:start position:0%
camera replacement people have mentioned
 
01:56:35.109 --> 01:56:35.119 align:start position:0%
it to me was the no driving force to do
 
01:56:38.109 --> 01:56:38.119 align:start position:0%
that I've not had a single request from
 
01:56:41.189 --> 01:56:41.199 align:start position:0%
the handicap Hunter to my knowledge to
 
01:56:43.270 --> 01:56:43.280 align:start position:0%
use a liveaction game camera if we had
 
01:56:44.830 --> 01:56:44.840 align:start position:0%
we would have address that we've had
 
01:56:46.350 --> 01:56:46.360 align:start position:0%
when they when they come to us over
 
01:56:48.870 --> 01:56:48.880 align:start position:0%
Mobility or the extension of if you
 
01:56:50.910 --> 01:56:50.920 align:start position:0%
remember few years ago at a committee
 
01:56:52.669 --> 01:56:52.679 align:start position:0%
extensional debating rules those types
 
01:56:54.750 --> 01:56:54.760 align:start position:0%
of things we do do I've not had a single
 
01:56:57.629 --> 01:56:57.639 align:start position:0%
handicap person come to us for that uh
 
01:57:02.470 --> 01:57:02.480 align:start position:0%
and and uh ra the first time I heard and
 
01:57:05.430 --> 01:57:05.440 align:start position:0%
organized uh Farm buau concern was from
 
01:57:07.030 --> 01:57:07.040 align:start position:0%
Rob the other day when we start talking
 
01:57:08.510 --> 01:57:08.520 align:start position:0%
with this but I've had numerous land
 
01:57:11.950 --> 01:57:11.960 align:start position:0%
owners mention to me is it legal the
 
01:57:14.189 --> 01:57:14.199 align:start position:0%
question comes more represents as a
 
01:57:15.790 --> 01:57:15.800 align:start position:0%
phone call or when they meet you is it
 
01:57:17.430 --> 01:57:17.440 align:start position:0%
legal to have a camera on my property
 
01:57:19.669 --> 01:57:19.679 align:start position:0%
without my permission my answer is yes
 
01:57:21.390 --> 01:57:21.400 align:start position:0%
and then they give me an opinion of that
 
01:57:23.229 --> 01:57:23.239 align:start position:0%
that is if I went out and wrote a rule
 
01:57:25.030 --> 01:57:25.040 align:start position:0%
every time I heard that I would be at JL
 
01:57:27.350 --> 01:57:27.360 align:start position:0%
car full time because I hear that kind
 
01:57:28.669 --> 01:57:28.679 align:start position:0%
of stuff all the time but I have no
 
01:57:30.870 --> 01:57:30.880 align:start position:0%
objections to anything that we just said
 
01:57:33.350 --> 01:57:33.360 align:start position:0%
if we should review that rule uh and the
 
01:57:35.950 --> 01:57:35.960 align:start position:0%
general public wants that then yeah we
 
01:57:38.270 --> 01:57:38.280 align:start position:0%
should be doing that I I don't like it
 
01:57:41.750 --> 01:57:41.760 align:start position:0%
in law and you know all the reasons
 
01:57:44.950 --> 01:57:44.960 align:start position:0%
why so that's why
 
01:57:47.350 --> 01:57:47.360 align:start position:0%
reest thank you representative dville go
 
01:57:49.189 --> 01:57:49.199 align:start position:0%
ahead and unmute yourself and ask your
 
01:57:49.199 --> 01:57:50.310 align:start position:0%
ahead and unmute yourself and ask your
question

01:57:50.310 --> 01:57:50.320 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:57:53.149 --> 01:57:53.159 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chair and uh thank you
 
01:57:55.790 --> 01:57:55.800 align:start position:0%
Colonel Jordan for taking my question uh
 
01:57:57.830 --> 01:57:57.840 align:start position:0%
the one thing that uh can you guys all
 
01:58:00.069 --> 01:58:00.079 align:start position:0%
hear me well
 
01:58:05.669 --> 01:58:05.679 align:start position:0%
there okay thank you um my question is
 
01:58:09.229 --> 01:58:09.239 align:start position:0%
um with the frequenc do you
 
01:58:13.950 --> 01:58:13.960 align:start position:0%
see um the the possibility of hunters
 
01:58:16.109 --> 01:58:16.119 align:start position:0%
with multiple
 
01:58:21.350 --> 01:58:21.360 align:start position:0%
cameras um being able to easily abused
 
01:58:24.910 --> 01:58:24.920 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to use multiple cameras
 
01:58:28.870 --> 01:58:28.880 align:start position:0%
because I I tend to see this up up north
 
01:58:32.550 --> 01:58:32.560 align:start position:0%
where there's lots of cameras already uh
 
01:58:34.589 --> 01:58:34.599 align:start position:0%
they're already you can go to Cabellas
 
01:58:38.069 --> 01:58:38.079 align:start position:0%
and get them all over the place uh like
 
01:58:40.189 --> 01:58:40.199 align:start position:0%
you mentioned stringing them together
 
01:58:42.510 --> 01:58:42.520 align:start position:0%
where somebody as opposed to it being
 
01:58:46.149 --> 01:58:46.159 align:start position:0%
green could actually be in a
 
01:58:48.669 --> 01:58:48.679 align:start position:0%
car like you had mentioned in a four
 
01:58:51.870 --> 01:58:51.880 align:start position:0%
square mile area they could be roaming
 
01:58:53.950 --> 01:58:53.960 align:start position:0%
around in their car and hear a ping on
 
01:58:56.270 --> 01:58:56.280 align:start position:0%
their phone and know exactly where
 
01:58:59.310 --> 01:58:59.320 align:start position:0%
they're going so is it this a potential
 
01:59:03.149 --> 01:59:03.159 align:start position:0%
bill that could be easily abused and
 
01:59:04.990 --> 01:59:05.000 align:start position:0%
hard to
 
01:59:08.550 --> 01:59:08.560 align:start position:0%
track yes the answer that shortly yes
 
01:59:11.270 --> 01:59:11.280 align:start position:0%
but you know these they sell a kit that
 
01:59:13.510 --> 01:59:13.520 align:start position:0%
contains four long range infrared
 
01:59:15.430 --> 01:59:15.440 align:start position:0%
cameras for instance in a private camera
 
01:59:17.350 --> 01:59:17.360 align:start position:0%
camera Network that allows you to link
 
01:59:19.910 --> 01:59:19.920 align:start position:0%
up to 16 cameras communic with each
 
01:59:22.270 --> 01:59:22.280 align:start position:0%
other don't require Wi-Fi or cellular
 
01:59:24.069 --> 01:59:24.079 align:start position:0%
service each photo that's taken in your
 
01:59:26.189 --> 01:59:26.199 align:start position:0%
camera network is sent directly to your
 
01:59:28.470 --> 01:59:28.480 align:start position:0%
home camera this came off an ad for
 
01:59:30.950 --> 01:59:30.960 align:start position:0%
these Camas allowing you to view them
 
01:59:32.589 --> 01:59:32.599 align:start position:0%
all in one place without spooking game
 
01:59:34.510 --> 01:59:34.520 align:start position:0%
or disrupting your Hotpot each trail
 
01:59:36.990 --> 01:59:37.000 align:start position:0%
camera has AAL range of quarter mile
 
01:59:38.750 --> 01:59:38.760 align:start position:0%
dense woods and more than a mile in open
 
01:59:40.790 --> 01:59:40.800 align:start position:0%
terrain this could automatically allow
 
01:59:43.910 --> 01:59:43.920 align:start position:0%
you to sink together um and creating a
 
01:59:45.470 --> 01:59:45.480 align:start position:0%
daisy chain that extends photo
 
01:59:48.109 --> 01:59:48.119 align:start position:0%
transmission four miles so the other
 
01:59:49.470 --> 01:59:49.480 align:start position:0%
argument I would make about the green
 
01:59:51.550 --> 01:59:51.560 align:start position:0%
argument which which is almost as
 
01:59:53.030 --> 01:59:53.040 align:start position:0%
laughable as the green argument but one
 
01:59:55.149 --> 01:59:55.159 align:start position:0%
other thing that we should think about
 
01:59:56.669 --> 01:59:56.679 align:start position:0%
don't we want Hunters coming to the
 
01:59:58.229 --> 01:59:58.239 align:start position:0%
North country and renting a room whether
 
02:00:00.030 --> 02:00:00.040 align:start position:0%
they get a deer or not and buying a
 
02:00:02.390 --> 02:00:02.400 align:start position:0%
buying a dinner and going out hunting I
 
02:00:03.870 --> 02:00:03.880 align:start position:0%
don't want them staying home I want them
 
02:00:06.390 --> 02:00:06.400 align:start position:0%
coming up here and so that could be You
 
02:00:07.990 --> 02:00:08.000 align:start position:0%
could argue that point on both sides and
 
02:00:09.310 --> 02:00:09.320 align:start position:0%
I think if you argu that in North
 
02:00:11.189 --> 02:00:11.199 align:start position:0%
Country it would come down on they want
 
02:00:14.990 --> 02:00:15.000 align:start position:0%
the hunters there so I certain so I I
 
02:00:16.310 --> 02:00:16.320 align:start position:0%
don't know that's going to save us any
 
02:00:18.229 --> 02:00:18.239 align:start position:0%
fuel I'd like to see them coming up and

um I'm just a a fly fisherman of some 50
 
02:02:29.510 --> 02:02:29.520 align:start position:0%
something years I live in
 
02:02:29.520 --> 02:02:31.229 align:start position:0%
something years I live in
Effingham

02:02:31.229 --> 02:02:31.239 align:start position:0%
Effingham
 
02:02:36.149 --> 02:02:36.159 align:start position:0%
um while up well the state maintains 16
 
02:02:38.390 --> 02:02:38.400 align:start position:0%
waters for the trout for brook trout
 
02:02:41.030 --> 02:02:41.040 align:start position:0%
salinus salvelinus Fountain Alice which
 
02:02:43.830 --> 02:02:43.840 align:start position:0%
is the state freshwater fish these
 
02:02:46.229 --> 02:02:46.239 align:start position:0%
waters are designated by there signage
 
02:02:47.950 --> 02:02:47.960 align:start position:0%
on them that says they're managed for
 
02:02:52.189 --> 02:02:52.199 align:start position:0%
wild trout wild brook trout I'm sorry um
 
02:02:54.229 --> 02:02:54.239 align:start position:0%
looking in that and again just being a
 
02:02:56.109 --> 02:02:56.119 align:start position:0%
concerned Citizen and something of a you
 
02:02:59.270 --> 02:02:59.280 align:start position:0%
know as I said devout fly fisherman I
 
02:03:01.629 --> 02:03:01.639 align:start position:0%
went to the
 
02:03:04.470 --> 02:03:04.480 align:start position:0%
regulations and in the
 
02:03:08.750 --> 02:03:08.760 align:start position:0%
rules where it discusses it's FIS 4067
 
02:03:11.589 --> 02:03:11.599 align:start position:0%
wild trout Waters it just mentions that
 
02:03:14.229 --> 02:03:14.239 align:start position:0%
this water body shall be manag for wild
 
02:03:19.270 --> 02:03:19.280 align:start position:0%
trout now it may not seem like much but
 
02:03:21.510 --> 02:03:21.520 align:start position:0%
uh fly fishermen are like golfers I mean
 
02:03:23.310 --> 02:03:23.320 align:start position:0%
we're kind of addicts and we might get
 
02:03:25.149 --> 02:03:25.159 align:start position:0%
you know there's a thousand questions
 
02:03:27.189 --> 02:03:27.199 align:start position:0%
and a thousand opinions and I was just
 
02:03:28.830 --> 02:03:28.840 align:start position:0%
thinking that it might be worth a while
 
02:03:31.870 --> 02:03:31.880 align:start position:0%
to add to make the to make the the the
 
02:03:36.030 --> 02:03:36.040 align:start position:0%
the rules match the signage so I was
 
02:03:38.990 --> 02:03:39.000 align:start position:0%
hoping to add the word wild brook
 
02:03:42.229 --> 02:03:42.239 align:start position:0%
trout onto FIS
 
02:03:45.350 --> 02:03:45.360 align:start position:0%
4607 and I took it one step further and
 
02:03:49.149 --> 02:03:49.159 align:start position:0%
I looked at the RSA on Brook TR trout
 
02:03:51.109 --> 02:03:51.119 align:start position:0%
and it defines brook trout rather
 
02:03:54.549 --> 02:03:54.559 align:start position:0%
Loosely it includes rainbow trout brown
 
02:03:57.149 --> 02:03:57.159 align:start position:0%
trout lock leav trout and other trouts
 
02:03:59.910 --> 02:03:59.920 align:start position:0%
that are hybrids and actually sort of
 
02:04:01.830 --> 02:04:01.840 align:start position:0%
invasive species I mean fishing game
 
02:04:04.189 --> 02:04:04.199 align:start position:0%
uses them to supplant I mean not
 
02:04:07.069 --> 02:04:07.079 align:start position:0%
supplant to supplement um the game
 
02:04:10.470 --> 02:04:10.480 align:start position:0%
Waters which is you know fine but I saw
 
02:04:13.589 --> 02:04:13.599 align:start position:0%
a little bit of an an issue where if a
 
02:04:15.549 --> 02:04:15.559 align:start position:0%
water is specifically managed for wild
 
02:04:17.910 --> 02:04:17.920 align:start position:0%
brook trout yet brook trout or man can
 
02:04:21.109 --> 02:04:21.119 align:start position:0%
be defined as any of four species it
 
02:04:22.750 --> 02:04:22.760 align:start position:0%
just opened up something of a can of
 
02:04:25.669 --> 02:04:25.679 align:start position:0%
worms in my mind I mean perhaps that
 
02:04:28.189 --> 02:04:28.199 align:start position:0%
could have just been me but I talked to
 
02:04:31.189 --> 02:04:31.199 align:start position:0%
representative avalani and we we put
 
02:04:34.870 --> 02:04:34.880 align:start position:0%
this forward um I I was reached M
 
02:04:37.030 --> 02:04:37.040 align:start position:0%
representative Alice Ellen Reed reached
 
02:04:39.990 --> 02:04:40.000 align:start position:0%
out last week and she had a constituent
 
02:04:42.830 --> 02:04:42.840 align:start position:0%
who was discussing it and we had a nice
 
02:04:45.470 --> 02:04:45.480 align:start position:0%
conversation and we came up with uh what
 
02:04:46.950 --> 02:04:46.960 align:start position:0%
would be an amended version which
 
02:04:49.470 --> 02:04:49.480 align:start position:0%
actually sort of hopefully clarifies
 
02:04:50.910 --> 02:04:50.920 align:start position:0%
a little bit of the
 
02:04:54.549 --> 02:04:54.559 align:start position:0%
definitions and hopefully sort of does
 
02:04:56.750 --> 02:04:56.760 align:start position:0%
what I was hoping to do which is just
 
02:04:59.390 --> 02:04:59.400 align:start position:0%
protect those 16 wild trout wild brook
 
02:04:59.400 --> 02:05:00.390 align:start position:0%
protect those 16 wild trout wild brook
trout

02:05:00.390 --> 02:05:00.400 align:start position:0%
trout
 
02:05:00.400 --> 02:05:02.109 align:start position:0%
trout
Waters

02:05:02.109 --> 02:05:02.119 align:start position:0%
Waters
 
02:05:06.669 --> 02:05:06.679 align:start position:0%
um my my hope is that you know we can
 
02:05:08.350 --> 02:05:08.360 align:start position:0%
just limit it to that there's a whole
 
02:05:11.549 --> 02:05:11.559 align:start position:0%
bunch of side issues relative to this
 
02:05:13.669 --> 02:05:13.679 align:start position:0%
there's Wild versus native trout there's
 
02:05:16.430 --> 02:05:16.440 align:start position:0%
bi biological discussions I mean there's
 
02:05:19.270 --> 02:05:19.280 align:start position:0%
a slew of things that that uh can be
 
02:05:21.790 --> 02:05:21.800 align:start position:0%
touched on when you sort of open this
 
02:05:23.709 --> 02:05:23.719 align:start position:0%
particular can of worms but my intent
 
02:05:25.950 --> 02:05:25.960 align:start position:0%
was just to sort of clean up the
 
02:05:28.950 --> 02:05:28.960 align:start position:0%
definition so that our state fish in the
 
02:05:31.870 --> 02:05:31.880 align:start position:0%
waters that are specifically set aside
 
02:05:35.189 --> 02:05:35.199 align:start position:0%
for it you know has the protection of
 
02:05:38.390 --> 02:05:38.400 align:start position:0%
the definition being correct um you know
 
02:05:41.229 --> 02:05:41.239 align:start position:0%
I'm not trying to to to change much more
 
02:05:43.069 --> 02:05:43.079 align:start position:0%
than that you know perhaps at this point
 
02:05:46.310 --> 02:05:46.320 align:start position:0%
I'm open to these discussions but you
 
02:05:48.430 --> 02:05:48.440 align:start position:0%
know that was my intent just to sort of
 
02:05:50.470 --> 02:05:50.480 align:start position:0%
take these 16 Waters and make sure that
 
02:05:52.510 --> 02:05:52.520 align:start position:0%
they're protect right I mean I don't
 
02:05:54.750 --> 02:05:54.760 align:start position:0%
doubt fishing game I know that their
 
02:05:57.229 --> 02:05:57.239 align:start position:0%
intent is right but again 20 years from
 
02:05:59.549 --> 02:05:59.559 align:start position:0%
now if the law is still the same you
 
02:06:01.149 --> 02:06:01.159 align:start position:0%
know what might happen there might be
 
02:06:04.310 --> 02:06:04.320 align:start position:0%
room for for error or confusion or you
 
02:06:06.470 --> 02:06:06.480 align:start position:0%
know there's there's a gray area there
 
02:06:08.589 --> 02:06:08.599 align:start position:0%
and again all I was hoping to do is just
 
02:06:11.149 --> 02:06:11.159 align:start position:0%
sort of close this particular loophole I
 
02:06:13.069 --> 02:06:13.079 align:start position:0%
believe representative Reed and I had a
 
02:06:15.669 --> 02:06:15.679 align:start position:0%
you know came to a wonderful conclusion
 
02:06:18.149 --> 02:06:18.159 align:start position:0%
and I mean at this point in time that
 
02:06:20.750 --> 02:06:20.760 align:start position:0%
amended version that she and that we
 
02:06:23.390 --> 02:06:23.400 align:start position:0%
discussed is is is the one that I'm very
 
02:06:26.350 --> 02:06:26.360 align:start position:0%
happy with so that's you know I set up a
 
02:06:29.069 --> 02:06:29.079 align:start position:0%
presentation but uh barring that and
 
02:06:31.750 --> 02:06:31.760 align:start position:0%
with the discussion over the past week
 
02:06:33.910 --> 02:06:33.920 align:start position:0%
um my presentation kind of became
 
02:06:37.350 --> 02:06:37.360 align:start position:0%
moot so you know literally like I said
 
02:06:40.510 --> 02:06:40.520 align:start position:0%
it's it's it's a very simple or my mind
 
02:06:42.310 --> 02:06:42.320 align:start position:0%
a very simple thing fishing game said
 
02:06:44.830 --> 02:06:44.840 align:start position:0%
they would need time to go through it uh
 
02:06:47.470 --> 02:06:47.480 align:start position:0%
chairman Lang discussed it with them and
 
02:06:50.030 --> 02:06:50.040 align:start position:0%
hopefully you know as it sits all
 
02:06:53.229 --> 02:06:53.239 align:start position:0%
parties to this are happy um I'm very
 
02:06:55.790 --> 02:06:55.800 align:start position:0%
happy with it so that's you know if
 
02:06:57.069 --> 02:06:57.079 align:start position:0%
there's any questions I'm more than
 
02:06:59.350 --> 02:06:59.360 align:start position:0%
happy to answer otherwise I might have
 
02:07:01.229 --> 02:07:01.239 align:start position:0%
to cut out and get back to teaching math
 
02:07:02.390 --> 02:07:02.400 align:start position:0%
for a
 
02:07:05.069 --> 02:07:05.079 align:start position:0%
bit thank you Mr waler any questions for
 
02:07:05.079 --> 02:07:08.270 align:start position:0%
bit thank you Mr waler any questions for
Mr

02:07:08.270 --> 02:07:08.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:11.149 --> 02:07:11.159 align:start position:0%
Walsh there being none go back to
 
02:07:13.629 --> 02:07:13.639 align:start position:0%
students and enjoy teaching math oh Mr
 
02:07:15.549 --> 02:07:15.559 align:start position:0%
re I apologize there was one question
 
02:07:21.390 --> 02:07:21.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:25.030 --> 02:07:25.040 align:start position:0%
um if um I understand that you're
 
02:07:26.430 --> 02:07:26.440 align:start position:0%
comfortable with the amendment that
 
02:07:31.189 --> 02:07:31.199 align:start position:0%
would go with this oh yes yes um I had I
 
02:07:34.149 --> 02:07:34.159 align:start position:0%
had approached uh originally hope hoping
 
02:07:37.870 --> 02:07:37.880 align:start position:0%
to have the change it well the original
 
02:07:40.589 --> 02:07:40.599 align:start position:0%
thought was to add the word Brook into
 
02:07:43.189 --> 02:07:43.199 align:start position:0%
the water bodies manag for wild trout
 
02:07:45.830 --> 02:07:45.840 align:start position:0%
and change the definition I think the uh
 
02:07:47.709 --> 02:07:47.719 align:start position:0%
the uh Legal Services people sort of
 
02:07:51.470 --> 02:07:51.480 align:start position:0%
combined the two with the original Bill
 
02:07:53.790 --> 02:07:53.800 align:start position:0%
and it in my mind it it sort of left out
 
02:07:56.950 --> 02:07:56.960 align:start position:0%
the protection for the wild trout Waters
 
02:07:58.470 --> 02:07:58.480 align:start position:0%
the amended version that that
 
02:08:00.790 --> 02:08:00.800 align:start position:0%
representative Reed and I discussed does
 
02:08:03.109 --> 02:08:03.119 align:start position:0%
that I'm very happy with the wordage in
 
02:08:06.990 --> 02:08:07.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:09.870 --> 02:08:09.880 align:start position:0%
absolutely thank you thank you any
 
02:08:13.470 --> 02:08:13.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:15.990 --> 02:08:16.000 align:start position:0%
Walsh there being none thank you again
 
02:08:16.000 --> 02:08:17.430 align:start position:0%
Walsh there being none thank you again

Mr
Walsh

02:08:22.910 --> 02:08:22.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:24.390 --> 02:08:24.400 align:start position:0%
is there anybody else who wishes to
 
02:08:32.510 --> 02:08:32.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:34.669 --> 02:08:34.679 align:start position:0%
trout and Colonel I am gonna have you
 
02:08:36.589 --> 02:08:36.599 align:start position:0%
come up and testify in a minute uh but
 
02:08:41.069 --> 02:08:41.079 align:start position:0%
I'll recognize um Jason stock um to
 
02:08:44.350 --> 02:08:44.360 align:start position:0%
speak good good morning uh this is Jason
 
02:08:46.629 --> 02:08:46.639 align:start position:0%
stock I'm the executive director of the
 
02:08:48.350 --> 02:08:48.360 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Timberland owners associ
 
02:08:50.990 --> 02:08:51.000 align:start position:0%
assciation and uh thank you for allowing
 
02:08:54.629 --> 02:08:54.639 align:start position:0%
me to speak on this bill we we are uh we
 
02:08:57.310 --> 02:08:57.320 align:start position:0%
did I did not intend to speak on it but
 
02:09:00.470 --> 02:09:00.480 align:start position:0%
what I would like to request is if it
 
02:09:02.629 --> 02:09:02.639 align:start position:0%
would be possible to see the
 
02:09:06.870 --> 02:09:06.880 align:start position:0%
amendment uh before it it gets acted on
 
02:09:09.750 --> 02:09:09.760 align:start position:0%
um for the simple reason that many of
 
02:09:13.950 --> 02:09:13.960 align:start position:0%
these trout streams are on our members
 
02:09:17.189 --> 02:09:17.199 align:start position:0%
property and what we don't want to see
 
02:09:18.910 --> 02:09:18.920 align:start position:0%
occur or what
 
02:09:21.030 --> 02:09:21.040 align:start position:0%
we're concerned about is that if there
 
02:09:24.790 --> 02:09:24.800 align:start position:0%
is going to be a additional form of
 
02:09:27.629 --> 02:09:27.639 align:start position:0%
Regulation controls or management
 
02:09:30.350 --> 02:09:30.360 align:start position:0%
associated with specific streams we
 
02:09:31.750 --> 02:09:31.760 align:start position:0%
would at least appreciate the
 
02:09:34.189 --> 02:09:34.199 align:start position:0%
opportunity to see what is being
 
02:09:38.069 --> 02:09:38.079 align:start position:0%
proposed so that um we know what's
 
02:09:41.669 --> 02:09:41.679 align:start position:0%
what's occurring in in the general court
 
02:09:44.149 --> 02:09:44.159 align:start position:0%
and by extension on our ability to
 
02:09:46.870 --> 02:09:46.880 align:start position:0%
manage for forestry and Forest
 
02:09:49.109 --> 02:09:49.119 align:start position:0%
management um
 
02:09:52.109 --> 02:09:52.119 align:start position:0%
right now in particularly in Coos County
 
02:09:55.229 --> 02:09:55.239 align:start position:0%
and many of the unincorporated places
 
02:09:58.669 --> 02:09:58.679 align:start position:0%
there are special zones that have
 
02:10:03.430 --> 02:10:03.440 align:start position:0%
reparan areas um associated with trout
 
02:10:07.390 --> 02:10:07.400 align:start position:0%
streams and if this proposal is going to
 
02:10:10.189 --> 02:10:10.199 align:start position:0%
change what is defined as a trout stream
 
02:10:12.350 --> 02:10:12.360 align:start position:0%
somehow that may
 
02:10:16.510 --> 02:10:16.520 align:start position:0%
change which uh well thank you uh that
 
02:10:19.270 --> 02:10:19.280 align:start position:0%
may change which streams are in fact
 
02:10:22.189 --> 02:10:22.199 align:start position:0%
falling into this so I would I see it on
 
02:10:25.270 --> 02:10:25.280 align:start position:0%
the screen now now and I appreciate that
 
02:10:28.470 --> 02:10:28.480 align:start position:0%
um would like an opportunity to also
 
02:10:30.109 --> 02:10:30.119 align:start position:0%
talk to some of the land managers
 
02:10:32.310 --> 02:10:32.320 align:start position:0%
associated with those properties to see
 
02:10:35.069 --> 02:10:35.079 align:start position:0%
if this would in fact affect their
 
02:10:36.430 --> 02:10:36.440 align:start position:0%
property and their ability to do the
 
02:10:38.189 --> 02:10:38.199 align:start position:0%
forestry on their
 
02:10:41.270 --> 02:10:41.280 align:start position:0%
property with that I will like I said I
 
02:10:43.830 --> 02:10:43.840 align:start position:0%
didn't have any prepared comments but
 
02:10:47.229 --> 02:10:47.239 align:start position:0%
I'd be happy to try to answer any
 
02:10:47.239 --> 02:10:48.830 align:start position:0%
I'd be happy to try to answer any
questions

02:10:48.830 --> 02:10:48.840 align:start position:0%
questions
 
02:10:55.750 --> 02:10:55.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:57.910 --> 02:10:57.920 align:start position:0%
stock looks like you're all set to go
 
02:11:01.030 --> 02:11:01.040 align:start position:0%
Jason thank you
 
02:11:03.709 --> 02:11:03.719 align:start position:0%
chairman colon Jordan would you like to
 
02:11:06.470 --> 02:11:06.480 align:start position:0%
step up to the seat again I tell you I
 
02:11:08.149 --> 02:11:08.159 align:start position:0%
have been scrambling to try and find a
 
02:11:11.270 --> 02:11:11.280 align:start position:0%
Fisheries biologist and failed uh
 
02:11:15.229 --> 02:11:15.239 align:start position:0%
someone will pay for that uh but I will
 
02:11:17.750 --> 02:11:17.760 align:start position:0%
say that the amendment I don't believe
 
02:11:18.950 --> 02:11:18.960 align:start position:0%
that the
 
02:11:21.229 --> 02:11:21.239 align:start position:0%
I know the commission has not seen it to
 
02:11:23.470 --> 02:11:23.480 align:start position:0%
be able to take a position on they did
 
02:11:25.069 --> 02:11:25.079 align:start position:0%
have concerns about the original bill
 
02:11:26.589 --> 02:11:26.599 align:start position:0%
and the reasons that they had concerns
 
02:11:29.629 --> 02:11:29.639 align:start position:0%
it was it back past and the definition
 
02:11:31.790 --> 02:11:31.800 align:start position:0%
changed we would have to go back in and
 
02:11:34.189 --> 02:11:34.199 align:start position:0%
change all of the 400 rules it would be
 
02:11:37.990 --> 02:11:38.000 align:start position:0%
an expense for us for signage and and
 
02:11:41.669 --> 02:11:41.679 align:start position:0%
the Mr Walsh I believe brought up a very
 
02:11:44.149 --> 02:11:44.159 align:start position:0%
good point in that wild brook trout are
 
02:11:45.910 --> 02:11:45.920 align:start position:0%
referred to by many different people in
 
02:11:47.709 --> 02:11:47.719 align:start position:0%
many different ways so you need to be
 
02:11:50.030 --> 02:11:50.040 align:start position:0%
really careful I would do that I put in
 
02:11:53.270 --> 02:11:53.280 align:start position:0%
stock book TR and and stocking off a
 
02:11:54.990 --> 02:11:55.000 align:start position:0%
stocking truck and back an hour later to
 
02:11:56.549 --> 02:11:56.559 align:start position:0%
have a fisherman show me that made a
 
02:11:58.589 --> 02:11:58.599 align:start position:0%
book TR that just got had to be made it
 
02:12:00.910 --> 02:12:00.920 align:start position:0%
because look at so there there's going
 
02:12:04.109 --> 02:12:04.119 align:start position:0%
to be some confusion there uh we need to
 
02:12:05.950 --> 02:12:05.960 align:start position:0%
I think move slowly on that to make sure
 
02:12:07.950 --> 02:12:07.960 align:start position:0%
that people understand so we again don't
 
02:12:11.790 --> 02:12:11.800 align:start position:0%
make criminals people be criminals so I
 
02:12:14.950 --> 02:12:14.960 align:start position:0%
would ask that we I can't say we support
 
02:12:16.430 --> 02:12:16.440 align:start position:0%
the amendment
 
02:12:19.109 --> 02:12:19.119 align:start position:0%
because Jason BRS up good point land
 
02:12:20.750 --> 02:12:20.760 align:start position:0%
owners I would ask if we move kind
 
02:12:23.069 --> 02:12:23.079 align:start position:0%
slowly make sure that we get it right
 
02:12:26.149 --> 02:12:26.159 align:start position:0%
when we do it um the amendment to me
 
02:12:29.030 --> 02:12:29.040 align:start position:0%
looking than the amendment looks clear I
 
02:12:31.109 --> 02:12:31.119 align:start position:0%
think we're on way and I was kind of
 
02:12:33.270 --> 02:12:33.280 align:start position:0%
looking for input from my fish file just
 
02:12:36.270 --> 02:12:36.280 align:start position:0%
make sure
 
02:12:39.109 --> 02:12:39.119 align:start position:0%
concerns thank you uh represent Spain
 
02:12:41.510 --> 02:12:41.520 align:start position:0%
for a question
 
02:12:44.390 --> 02:12:44.400 align:start position:0%
yes thank you Mr chair and I thank you
 
02:12:47.709 --> 02:12:47.719 align:start position:0%
Colonel Jordan for taking my question um
 
02:12:51.709 --> 02:12:51.719 align:start position:0%
is it true that the native Brook Trout
 
02:12:53.430 --> 02:12:53.440 align:start position:0%
the one that's native to New Hampshire
 
02:12:56.310 --> 02:12:56.320 align:start position:0%
is actually called a Char and if that's
 
02:12:58.470 --> 02:12:58.480 align:start position:0%
the case with that I've heard why is
 
02:12:59.990 --> 02:13:00.000 align:start position:0%
that language not listed in the
 
02:13:02.350 --> 02:13:02.360 align:start position:0%
amendment as one of the names a Char is
 
02:13:05.430 --> 02:13:05.440 align:start position:0%
a juvenile fish name a Native fish brook
 
02:13:07.830 --> 02:13:07.840 align:start position:0%
trout is a
 
02:13:11.510 --> 02:13:11.520 align:start position:0%
fish brook trout came here natural not
 
02:13:14.990 --> 02:13:15.000 align:start position:0%
something brought in AAR is a juvenile
 
02:13:20.589 --> 02:13:20.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:24.030 --> 02:13:24.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:26.430 --> 02:13:26.440 align:start position:0%
biological any further questions for
 
02:13:26.440 --> 02:13:28.030 align:start position:0%
biological any further questions for
Colonel

02:13:28.030 --> 02:13:28.040 align:start position:0%
Colonel
 
02:13:30.310 --> 02:13:30.320 align:start position:0%
Jordan so col Jordan again if I can
 
02:13:33.750 --> 02:13:33.760 align:start position:0%
summarize what you said to me the the
 
02:13:36.030 --> 02:13:36.040 align:start position:0%
original Bill had the original bill has
 
02:13:39.270 --> 02:13:39.280 align:start position:0%
problems and it creates regulatory
 
02:13:41.750 --> 02:13:41.760 align:start position:0%
problems for you under current current
 
02:13:44.669 --> 02:13:44.679 align:start position:0%
regulations anying cost the new
 
02:13:46.229 --> 02:13:46.239 align:start position:0%
definition you just haven't had a chance
 
02:13:47.790 --> 02:13:47.800 align:start position:0%
to look at to see if it's it's going to
 
02:13:49.750 --> 02:13:49.760 align:start position:0%
work work with the current statutes or
 
02:13:53.950 --> 02:13:53.960 align:start position:0%
not CH to it it looks better to me it
 
02:13:56.069 --> 02:13:56.079 align:start position:0%
looks clear but I would want them to
 
02:13:57.310 --> 02:13:57.320 align:start position:0%
have that opportunity and I would really
 
02:13:59.990 --> 02:14:00.000 align:start position:0%
like to have the committee maybe even
 
02:14:03.470 --> 02:14:03.480 align:start position:0%
work with Jason Smith fish in Fish to
 
02:14:05.390 --> 02:14:05.400 align:start position:0%
make sure we can create something that
 
02:14:09.030 --> 02:14:09.040 align:start position:0%
solves both Mr concern without affecting
 
02:14:09.040 --> 02:14:11.470 align:start position:0%
solves both Mr concern without affecting
land

02:14:11.470 --> 02:14:11.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:14.669 --> 02:14:14.679 align:start position:0%
owners thank you Colonel thank you
 
02:14:14.679 --> 02:14:16.870 align:start position:0%
owners thank you Colonel thank you
anyone

02:14:16.870 --> 02:14:16.880 align:start position:0%
anyone
 
02:14:16.880 --> 02:14:23.189 align:start position:0%
anyone
else

02:14:23.189 --> 02:14:23.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:25.830 --> 02:14:25.840 align:start position:0%
so uh Jason Smith has his hand raised in
 
02:14:27.870 --> 02:14:27.880 align:start position:0%
the attendees we'll again unmute him so
 
02:14:29.589 --> 02:14:29.599 align:start position:0%
he can speak Jason if you unmute your
 
02:14:36.030 --> 02:14:36.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:42.270 --> 02:14:42.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:44.549 --> 02:14:44.559 align:start position:0%
sir okay we're gonna move on to there he
 
02:14:46.229 --> 02:14:46.239 align:start position:0%
is you're unmuted now good morning sir
 
02:14:47.549 --> 02:14:47.559 align:start position:0%
this is Jason Smith with New Hampshire
 
02:14:50.390 --> 02:14:50.400 align:start position:0%
fishing game um just thought i' chime in
 
02:14:53.310 --> 02:14:53.320 align:start position:0%
to uh kind of strengthen Colonel
 
02:14:56.589 --> 02:14:56.599 align:start position:0%
Jordan's testimony um briefly so the
 
02:14:59.310 --> 02:14:59.320 align:start position:0%
original Bill had some fundamental
 
02:15:01.270 --> 02:15:01.280 align:start position:0%
problems that seem really simple on the
 
02:15:05.669 --> 02:15:05.679 align:start position:0%
surface um one being that because
 
02:15:07.390 --> 02:15:07.400 align:start position:0%
historically we've always
 
02:15:10.990 --> 02:15:11.000 align:start position:0%
included all three species of trout and
 
02:15:11.000 --> 02:15:11.870 align:start position:0%
included all three species of trout and
their

02:15:11.870 --> 02:15:11.880 align:start position:0%
their
 
02:15:17.149 --> 02:15:17.159 align:start position:0%
hybrids in our uh lumped into our season
 
02:15:20.109 --> 02:15:20.119 align:start position:0%
dates and bag limits to change the
 
02:15:21.830 --> 02:15:21.840 align:start position:0%
definition of a brck trout without going
 
02:15:23.750 --> 02:15:23.760 align:start position:0%
through some proper planning would
 
02:15:23.760 --> 02:15:25.149 align:start position:0%
through some proper planning would
ultimately

02:15:25.149 --> 02:15:25.159 align:start position:0%
ultimately
 
02:15:27.350 --> 02:15:27.360 align:start position:0%
eliminate all the season dates of bag
 
02:15:29.790 --> 02:15:29.800 align:start position:0%
limits for Browns and rainbow trout so
 
02:15:31.589 --> 02:15:31.599 align:start position:0%
that was that was the first major red
 
02:15:33.109 --> 02:15:33.119 align:start position:0%
flag on the initial
 
02:15:36.390 --> 02:15:36.400 align:start position:0%
bill um so that would obviously cause a
 
02:15:40.750 --> 02:15:40.760 align:start position:0%
lot of problems the um in the amendment
 
02:15:43.750 --> 02:15:43.760 align:start position:0%
I think there's some confusion here as
 
02:15:48.790 --> 02:15:48.800 align:start position:0%
to what a wild trout is and what a wild
 
02:15:52.350 --> 02:15:52.360 align:start position:0%
trout management plan is we have over
 
02:15:54.790 --> 02:15:54.800 align:start position:0%
2500 streams and rivers in the state of
 
02:15:56.750 --> 02:15:56.760 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire that have documented wild
 
02:15:58.990 --> 02:15:59.000 align:start position:0%
brook trout populations which brings you
 
02:16:00.990 --> 02:16:01.000 align:start position:0%
to the next question is what is actually
 
02:16:03.950 --> 02:16:03.960 align:start position:0%
defined as management uh we have what's
 
02:16:06.270 --> 02:16:06.280 align:start position:0%
a wild trout Management program that is
 
02:16:09.709 --> 02:16:09.719 align:start position:0%
specific to Wild brook trout Although
 
02:16:12.109 --> 02:16:12.119 align:start position:0%
our rule does not specify brook trout it
 
02:16:14.830 --> 02:16:14.840 align:start position:0%
is it is trout it's areas that we do not
 
02:16:17.910 --> 02:16:17.920 align:start position:0%
stock it is areas that is artificial l
 
02:16:20.709 --> 02:16:20.719 align:start position:0%
or only or fly and all fish must be
 
02:16:23.990 --> 02:16:24.000 align:start position:0%
caught and immediately released so with
 
02:16:27.790 --> 02:16:27.800 align:start position:0%
um so that's kind of Point number two uh
 
02:16:30.629 --> 02:16:30.639 align:start position:0%
the third thing is this statute as it
 
02:16:33.709 --> 02:16:33.719 align:start position:0%
reads now neglects to list lake trout
 
02:16:35.870 --> 02:16:35.880 align:start position:0%
you know lake trout are native to New
 
02:16:39.270 --> 02:16:39.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire they originated in six of our
 
02:16:41.349 --> 02:16:41.359 align:start position:0%
cold large deep water
 
02:16:45.870 --> 02:16:45.880 align:start position:0%
lakes and this would also lump them into
 
02:16:48.589 --> 02:16:48.599 align:start position:0%
the existing bag limits or remove their
 
02:16:50.910 --> 02:16:50.920 align:start position:0%
bag limits all together uh rather than
 
02:16:54.230 --> 02:16:54.240 align:start position:0%
to be the two fish 18inch
 
02:16:58.389 --> 02:16:58.399 align:start position:0%
limit um and looking at some of the
 
02:17:02.629 --> 02:17:02.639 align:start position:0%
Amendments the amendment tries to lump
 
02:17:05.110 --> 02:17:05.120 align:start position:0%
all the water bodies in a specific table
 
02:17:07.910 --> 02:17:07.920 align:start position:0%
T titled table
 
02:17:11.270 --> 02:17:11.280 align:start position:0%
400.1 table 400.1 if you go through our
 
02:17:11.280 --> 02:17:12.870 align:start position:0%
400.1 table 400.1 if you go through our
FIS

02:17:12.870 --> 02:17:12.880 align:start position:0%
FIS
 
02:17:15.629 --> 02:17:15.639 align:start position:0%
manual is every water body in the state
 
02:17:18.750 --> 02:17:18.760 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire that is a pond
 
02:17:21.750 --> 02:17:21.760 align:start position:0%
that has special regulations on it some
 
02:17:24.349 --> 02:17:24.359 align:start position:0%
of these special regulations are things
 
02:17:27.990 --> 02:17:28.000 align:start position:0%
such as some of our quality Bass
 
02:17:30.469 --> 02:17:30.479 align:start position:0%
Tournament regulations so a lot of these
 
02:17:33.910 --> 02:17:33.920 align:start position:0%
water bodies that are listed in table
 
02:17:37.750 --> 02:17:37.760 align:start position:0%
400.1 do not even have brook trout in
 
02:17:40.469 --> 02:17:40.479 align:start position:0%
even more so while brook trout inhabited
 
02:17:40.479 --> 02:17:41.669 align:start position:0%
even more so while brook trout inhabited
with

02:17:41.669 --> 02:17:41.679 align:start position:0%
with
 
02:17:45.669 --> 02:17:45.679 align:start position:0%
them so I just would proceed with
 
02:17:47.950 --> 02:17:47.960 align:start position:0%
caution on this because it seems simple
 
02:17:50.270 --> 02:17:50.280 align:start position:0%
on the surface but there is a lot going
 
02:17:54.070 --> 02:17:54.080 align:start position:0%
on here uh and with that I would more
 
02:17:56.509 --> 02:17:56.519 align:start position:0%
been more than happy to take any
 
02:17:58.950 --> 02:17:58.960 align:start position:0%
questions any questions for Mr Smith
 
02:18:02.629 --> 02:18:02.639 align:start position:0%
from Vision game representative
 
02:18:05.270 --> 02:18:05.280 align:start position:0%
Harvey so with those problems that you
 
02:18:06.990 --> 02:18:07.000 align:start position:0%
mentioning which seem rather significant
 
02:18:10.629 --> 02:18:10.639 align:start position:0%
to me um is this sometimes we can fix a
 
02:18:12.870 --> 02:18:12.880 align:start position:0%
bill and sometimes we just need to start
 
02:18:14.750 --> 02:18:14.760 align:start position:0%
over again is this a bill that you think
 
02:18:18.549 --> 02:18:18.559 align:start position:0%
is actually fixable or should we start
 
02:18:20.469 --> 02:18:20.479 align:start position:0%
from scratch in your
 
02:18:24.349 --> 02:18:24.359 align:start position:0%
opinion not with extensive work and as I
 
02:18:26.910 --> 02:18:26.920 align:start position:0%
mentioned earlier I think it would
 
02:18:30.030 --> 02:18:30.040 align:start position:0%
probably be best handled through rule um
 
02:18:33.709 --> 02:18:33.719 align:start position:0%
just because a lot of our specificity
 
02:18:35.230 --> 02:18:35.240 align:start position:0%
and our real details in our fishing
 
02:18:38.509 --> 02:18:38.519 align:start position:0%
management and regulations lies in rule
 
02:18:40.469 --> 02:18:40.479 align:start position:0%
um so I I think it's probably best
 
02:18:40.479 --> 02:18:43.349 align:start position:0%
um so I I think it's probably best
handled

02:18:43.349 --> 02:18:43.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:46.509 --> 02:18:46.519 align:start position:0%
there anyone else for Mr
 
02:18:46.519 --> 02:18:49.349 align:start position:0%
there anyone else for Mr
Smith

02:18:49.349 --> 02:18:49.359 align:start position:0%
Smith
 
02:18:52.190 --> 02:18:52.200 align:start position:0%

unlimited and
 
02:19:33.469 --> 02:19:33.479 align:start position:0%
um we've been working very closely with
 
02:19:36.629 --> 02:19:36.639 align:start position:0%
Jason Smith and his team to work on
 
02:19:38.469 --> 02:19:38.479 align:start position:0%
these particular issues that are being
 
02:19:41.509 --> 02:19:41.519 align:start position:0%
brought forward to the
 
02:19:44.230 --> 02:19:44.240 align:start position:0%
committee uh it's my understanding that
 
02:19:46.910 --> 02:19:46.920 align:start position:0%
something like this could be done by
 
02:19:49.830 --> 02:19:49.840 align:start position:0%
rule not necessarily by
 
02:19:53.790 --> 02:19:53.800 align:start position:0%
legislation and um I've attended every
 
02:19:56.550 --> 02:19:56.560 align:start position:0%
Commission meeting in the last four and
 
02:19:59.950 --> 02:19:59.960 align:start position:0%
a half years and I don't recall anybody
 
02:20:02.670 --> 02:20:02.680 align:start position:0%
having had this brought forward by
 
02:20:05.630 --> 02:20:05.640 align:start position:0%
petition to the commission to have a
 
02:20:05.640 --> 02:20:07.190 align:start position:0%
petition to the commission to have a
rule

02:20:07.190 --> 02:20:07.200 align:start position:0%
rule
 
02:20:09.990 --> 02:20:10.000 align:start position:0%
change um I don't profess to be an
 
02:20:13.349 --> 02:20:13.359 align:start position:0%
expert on any of this but it just seems
 
02:20:16.510 --> 02:20:16.520 align:start position:0%
to me that if uh this could be done by
 
02:20:18.429 --> 02:20:18.439 align:start position:0%
rule change
 
02:20:21.230 --> 02:20:21.240 align:start position:0%
um and take care of all of the issues
 
02:20:24.830 --> 02:20:24.840 align:start position:0%
that have been brought up uh during this
 
02:20:29.349 --> 02:20:29.359 align:start position:0%
discussion so um that's what I'd like to
 
02:20:32.790 --> 02:20:32.800 align:start position:0%
put forward to the group and I certainly
 
02:20:35.150 --> 02:20:35.160 align:start position:0%
would answer any
 
02:20:40.030 --> 02:20:40.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:42.950 --> 02:20:42.960 align:start position:0%
angers seeing none thank you
 
02:20:46.309 --> 02:20:46.319 align:start position:0%
sir on the hot seat one more
 
02:20:46.319 --> 02:20:50.590 align:start position:0%
sir on the hot seat one more
second

02:20:50.590 --> 02:20:50.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:52.510 --> 02:20:52.520 align:start position:0%
so I just have a clarification question
 
02:20:54.270 --> 02:20:54.280 align:start position:0%
so again I think this becomes one of
 
02:20:56.110 --> 02:20:56.120 align:start position:0%
those things where we have in statute we
 
02:20:58.590 --> 02:20:58.600 align:start position:0%
also have in regulation and what happens
 
02:21:00.070 --> 02:21:00.080 align:start position:0%
with this because we have a definition
 
02:21:02.510 --> 02:21:02.520 align:start position:0%
here that I think the understanding is
 
02:21:04.389 --> 02:21:04.399 align:start position:0%
that this definition is referenc in all
 
02:21:05.910 --> 02:21:05.920 align:start position:0%
your regulations and if we change it
 
02:21:07.469 --> 02:21:07.479 align:start position:0%
here we have problems with the
 
02:21:10.590 --> 02:21:10.600 align:start position:0%
regulations um but at the same point if
 
02:21:14.469 --> 02:21:14.479 align:start position:0%
you refer to this this statute and we
 
02:21:16.110 --> 02:21:16.120 align:start position:0%
there's some we want to move forward
 
02:21:18.150 --> 02:21:18.160 align:start position:0%
with kind of delineating difference
 
02:21:19.510 --> 02:21:19.520 align:start position:0%
between a brook trout and a rainbow
 
02:21:22.550 --> 02:21:22.560 align:start position:0%
trout um how do we go about that can you
 
02:21:24.230 --> 02:21:24.240 align:start position:0%
do that in regulation if there's a law
 
02:21:25.510 --> 02:21:25.520 align:start position:0%
like this already on the books the way
 
02:21:27.790 --> 02:21:27.800 align:start position:0%
tra yeah just have to follow what when
 
02:21:29.190 --> 02:21:29.200 align:start position:0%
you do the regulation you have to follow
 
02:21:32.710 --> 02:21:32.720 align:start position:0%
the law so if you're looking to change
 
02:21:34.630 --> 02:21:34.640 align:start position:0%
depending on how much of that definition
 
02:21:37.070 --> 02:21:37.080 align:start position:0%
you you want to change you would have to
 
02:21:40.190 --> 02:21:40.200 align:start position:0%
change the regulation if it's in law
 
02:21:43.950 --> 02:21:43.960 align:start position:0%
you'd have to change the law um we can
 
02:21:45.670 --> 02:21:45.680 align:start position:0%
make a
 
02:21:49.150 --> 02:21:49.160 align:start position:0%
rule try to was careful we can we can
 
02:21:51.510 --> 02:21:51.520 align:start position:0%
create an administrative rule as long as
 
02:21:53.790 --> 02:21:53.800 align:start position:0%
we don't conflict with an existing
 
02:21:56.309 --> 02:21:56.319 align:start position:0%
statute I guess the best way I explain
 
02:21:58.990 --> 02:21:59.000 align:start position:0%
so if the definition is in
 
02:22:02.429 --> 02:22:02.439 align:start position:0%
law and and we're looking to change that
 
02:22:04.830 --> 02:22:04.840 align:start position:0%
we would have to change law and then
 
02:22:08.550 --> 02:22:08.560 align:start position:0%
refine the rest of it in the
 
02:22:11.830 --> 02:22:11.840 align:start position:0%
recommendation and I I thought all of
 
02:22:15.950 --> 02:22:15.960 align:start position:0%
this was in I thought the definition
 
02:22:18.349 --> 02:22:18.359 align:start position:0%
already yeah that's what my question is
 
02:22:20.230 --> 02:22:20.240 align:start position:0%
the definition is in statute and your
 
02:22:22.429 --> 02:22:22.439 align:start position:0%
regulations refer to the definition so
 
02:22:23.870 --> 02:22:23.880 align:start position:0%
it seems like we kind of have to change
 
02:22:25.510 --> 02:22:25.520 align:start position:0%
it in statute if we want the regulation
 
02:22:27.630 --> 02:22:27.640 align:start position:0%
reflect it or repeal the definition and
 
02:22:30.710 --> 02:22:30.720 align:start position:0%
let you define your own
 
02:22:34.270 --> 02:22:34.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:36.510 --> 02:22:36.520 align:start position:0%
Spain thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
02:22:37.910 --> 02:22:37.920 align:start position:0%
for entertaining me one more time
 
02:22:40.950 --> 02:22:40.960 align:start position:0%
Colonel Jordan um it becomes my question
 
02:22:44.309 --> 02:22:44.319 align:start position:0%
based on what the chair has asked you if
 
02:22:47.990 --> 02:22:48.000 align:start position:0%
a definition in statute is overly Broad
 
02:22:50.469 --> 02:22:50.479 align:start position:0%
can it be refined and narrowed within
 
02:22:53.349 --> 02:22:53.359 align:start position:0%
rules without violating that it can as
 
02:22:56.389 --> 02:22:56.399 align:start position:0%
long as you don't inflict the
 
02:23:00.630 --> 02:23:00.640 align:start position:0%
stat follow up so would a an acceptable
 
02:23:03.590 --> 02:23:03.600 align:start position:0%
method to address this situation be to
 
02:23:07.110 --> 02:23:07.120 align:start position:0%
ensure that the the statute is defined
 
02:23:10.030 --> 02:23:10.040 align:start position:0%
broadly enough to allow fishing game to
 
02:23:13.349 --> 02:23:13.359 align:start position:0%
refine the definitions within their
 
02:23:16.630 --> 02:23:16.640 align:start position:0%
rules generally speaking yes that that
 
02:23:19.070 --> 02:23:19.080 align:start position:0%
would be best way to move my if you're
 
02:23:21.870 --> 02:23:21.880 align:start position:0%
if you're asking uh and I'm not sure you
 
02:23:24.590 --> 02:23:24.600 align:start position:0%
are uh asking for a recommendation my
 
02:23:27.790 --> 02:23:27.800 align:start position:0%
recommendation would be to work on this
 
02:23:30.870 --> 02:23:30.880 align:start position:0%
uh with Jason Chief fish and Paul who
 
02:23:33.590 --> 02:23:33.600 align:start position:0%
was our administ Ru person and I think
 
02:23:35.230 --> 02:23:35.240 align:start position:0%
we can avoid those conflicts because I
 
02:23:39.190 --> 02:23:39.200 align:start position:0%
think you need to be careful that yes
 
02:23:40.469 --> 02:23:40.479 align:start position:0%
thank you representative wolf I think
 
02:23:45.190 --> 02:23:45.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:47.750 --> 02:23:47.760 align:start position:0%
set thank you Mr chairman
 
02:23:51.670 --> 02:23:51.680 align:start position:0%
but then are you saying that in this
 
02:23:57.070 --> 02:23:57.080 align:start position:0%
case it can be reworked or do we need to
 
02:24:01.910 --> 02:24:01.920 align:start position:0%
uh amend the statute out of
 
02:24:05.030 --> 02:24:05.040 align:start position:0%
existence uh you could do both actually
 
02:24:07.309 --> 02:24:07.319 align:start position:0%
depending on what your goal is so if you
 
02:24:09.710 --> 02:24:09.720 align:start position:0%
wanted to if you wanted if you're
 
02:24:11.630 --> 02:24:11.640 align:start position:0%
looking to change the definition we have
 
02:24:14.150 --> 02:24:14.160 align:start position:0%
to review how it is in statute
 
02:24:17.070 --> 02:24:17.080 align:start position:0%
first to make sure that we make that
 
02:24:20.389 --> 02:24:20.399 align:start position:0%
change in statute what representa Spain
 
02:24:22.150 --> 02:24:22.160 align:start position:0%
was talking about was keeping that
 
02:24:24.190 --> 02:24:24.200 align:start position:0%
definition in statute as broad as we
 
02:24:26.469 --> 02:24:26.479 align:start position:0%
possibly could and
 
02:24:30.269 --> 02:24:30.279 align:start position:0%
refining the details if you will in R
 
02:24:31.990 --> 02:24:32.000 align:start position:0%
and his question was can we do that and
 
02:24:34.550 --> 02:24:34.560 align:start position:0%
I believe we can that the issue becomes
 
02:24:37.309 --> 02:24:37.319 align:start position:0%
if if we have a law that tells us one
 
02:24:39.550 --> 02:24:39.560 align:start position:0%
thing we try to create a rule to
 
02:24:41.990 --> 02:24:42.000 align:start position:0%
conflict with that you cannot do
 
02:24:44.590 --> 02:24:44.600 align:start position:0%
that thank you Mr chairman I think
 
02:24:47.950 --> 02:24:47.960 align:start position:0%
working with those two groups
 
02:24:50.110 --> 02:24:50.120 align:start position:0%
I don't want to say but a group working
 
02:24:53.510 --> 02:24:53.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:56.309 --> 02:24:56.319 align:start position:0%
think a so it sounds like you would
 
02:24:57.630 --> 02:24:57.640 align:start position:0%
support us retaining this bill for
 
02:24:59.910 --> 02:24:59.920 align:start position:0%
another year to work on it I can't tell
 
02:25:02.030 --> 02:25:02.040 align:start position:0%
you that I can tell you I support that I
 
02:25:02.040 --> 02:25:02.750 align:start position:0%
you that I can tell you I support that I
don't

02:25:02.750 --> 02:25:02.760 align:start position:0%
don't
 
02:25:04.950 --> 02:25:04.960 align:start position:0%
know thank you any other questions for
 
02:25:04.960 --> 02:25:05.590 align:start position:0%
know thank you any other questions for
the

02:25:05.590 --> 02:25:05.600 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:25:08.750 --> 02:25:08.760 align:start position:0%
colonel representative
 
02:25:11.230 --> 02:25:11.240 align:start position:0%
mckitrick thank you Mr
 
02:25:15.910 --> 02:25:15.920 align:start position:0%
chairman uh as it is currently as as
 
02:25:20.230 --> 02:25:20.240 align:start position:0%
current practice is for efficient game
 
02:25:24.910 --> 02:25:24.920 align:start position:0%
uh is there a problem now that this is
 
02:25:28.150 --> 02:25:28.160 align:start position:0%
correcting we that the agency I think
 
02:25:30.429 --> 02:25:30.439 align:start position:0%
I'm safe to say the agency doesn't feel
 
02:25:33.429 --> 02:25:33.439 align:start position:0%
its problem a constituent has brought it
 
02:25:35.110 --> 02:25:35.120 align:start position:0%
to our attention we don't feel there a
 
02:25:36.550 --> 02:25:36.560 align:start position:0%
problem we've been working with it for
 
02:25:38.910 --> 02:25:38.920 align:start position:0%
years and our concern is if we're not I
 
02:25:40.389 --> 02:25:40.399 align:start position:0%
think if I heard Jason correctly if
 
02:25:42.870 --> 02:25:42.880 align:start position:0%
we're not careful how we do it then we
 
02:25:45.030 --> 02:25:45.040 align:start position:0%
could have some really significant
 
02:25:47.990 --> 02:25:48.000 align:start position:0%
unintended problems so that's that's why
 
02:25:49.790 --> 02:25:49.800 align:start position:0%
I encourage us all to work together to
 
02:25:52.469 --> 02:25:52.479 align:start position:0%
try and do that for thank you for your
 
02:25:54.790 --> 02:25:54.800 align:start position:0%
question than
 
02:25:56.790 --> 02:25:56.800 align:start position:0%
you thank you Colonel I'm going to trade
 
02:25:58.230 --> 02:25:58.240 align:start position:0%
your hot seat with another fishing gave
 
02:26:00.110 --> 02:26:00.120 align:start position:0%
employee and bring Colonel oh I'm sorry
 
02:26:02.469 --> 02:26:02.479 align:start position:0%
one more M representative Smith go ahead
 
02:26:04.469 --> 02:26:04.479 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you Colonel
 
02:26:06.349 --> 02:26:06.359 align:start position:0%
I just have it's I'm backing up a little
 
02:26:08.389 --> 02:26:08.399 align:start position:0%
bit and uh I would imagine you can
 
02:26:09.710 --> 02:26:09.720 align:start position:0%
answer this the New Hampshire Timber
 
02:26:11.510 --> 02:26:11.520 align:start position:0%
owner association gentleman that spoke
 
02:26:13.510 --> 02:26:13.520 align:start position:0%
earlier said he had a big concern for
 
02:26:16.070 --> 02:26:16.080 align:start position:0%
land owners regarding the this
 
02:26:18.110 --> 02:26:18.120 align:start position:0%
definition change in I would imagine
 
02:26:20.070 --> 02:26:20.080 align:start position:0%
it's from a law enforcement perspective
 
02:26:21.550 --> 02:26:21.560 align:start position:0%
regarding these small creeks and Brooks
 
02:26:22.710 --> 02:26:22.720 align:start position:0%
running through their
 
02:26:25.790 --> 02:26:25.800 align:start position:0%
property I I would imagine what Jason
 
02:26:28.750 --> 02:26:28.760 align:start position:0%
was referring to as he's his clients are
 
02:26:31.750 --> 02:26:31.760 align:start position:0%
concern is land owners are concerned
 
02:26:35.349 --> 02:26:35.359 align:start position:0%
that uh any restrictions that may be put
 
02:26:37.190 --> 02:26:37.200 align:start position:0%
on these water bodies affecting the way
 
02:26:39.429 --> 02:26:39.439 align:start position:0%
they use their props yes that was his
 
02:26:41.950 --> 02:26:41.960 align:start position:0%
concern another another reason to do
 
02:26:45.030 --> 02:26:45.040 align:start position:0%
slow thank you thank any other questions
 
02:26:46.950 --> 02:26:46.960 align:start position:0%
for Colonel Jordan thank you than you
 
02:26:49.269 --> 02:26:49.279 align:start position:0%
Colonel for speaking uh we'll go to Paul
 
02:26:52.429 --> 02:26:52.439 align:start position:0%
Sanderson with the New Hampshire fishing
 
02:26:55.110 --> 02:26:55.120 align:start position:0%
game uh thank you Mr chair members of
 
02:26:58.710 --> 02:26:58.720 align:start position:0%
the committee I hope you can hear me um
 
02:27:01.790 --> 02:27:01.800 align:start position:0%
I yes uh I just wanted to uh re
 
02:27:03.590 --> 02:27:03.600 align:start position:0%
reiterate a couple of points here and
 
02:27:06.110 --> 02:27:06.120 align:start position:0%
suggest a possible procedural resolution
 
02:27:08.550 --> 02:27:08.560 align:start position:0%
for you uh the colonel was absolutely
 
02:27:10.469 --> 02:27:10.479 align:start position:0%
correct when he indicated that we cannot
 
02:27:13.110 --> 02:27:13.120 align:start position:0%
as a matter of administrative rul making
 
02:27:15.070 --> 02:27:15.080 align:start position:0%
adopt a provision that is inconsistent
 
02:27:17.670 --> 02:27:17.680 align:start position:0%
with an existing statute
 
02:27:19.870 --> 02:27:19.880 align:start position:0%
so one of the methods that could be used
 
02:27:21.670 --> 02:27:21.680 align:start position:0%
here to resolve the questions of the
 
02:27:23.389 --> 02:27:23.399 align:start position:0%
constituent and which we have used
 
02:27:26.670 --> 02:27:26.680 align:start position:0%
several times in the past recent past is
 
02:27:29.230 --> 02:27:29.240 align:start position:0%
to receive a petition to the fishing
 
02:27:31.190 --> 02:27:31.200 align:start position:0%
Game Commission and executive director
 
02:27:33.950 --> 02:27:33.960 align:start position:0%
as our rulem makers giving us very
 
02:27:36.469 --> 02:27:36.479 align:start position:0%
specific indications of what they feel
 
02:27:39.510 --> 02:27:39.520 align:start position:0%
are the problems at that point we can go
 
02:27:41.870 --> 02:27:41.880 align:start position:0%
forward and make a determination as to
 
02:27:43.630 --> 02:27:43.640 align:start position:0%
whether there needs to be a change in
 
02:27:46.790 --> 02:27:46.800 align:start position:0%
our administrative rules based upon the
 
02:27:48.429 --> 02:27:48.439 align:start position:0%
problem that the constituent would like
 
02:27:50.830 --> 02:27:50.840 align:start position:0%
to solve we may or may not need a
 
02:27:53.590 --> 02:27:53.600 align:start position:0%
statutory change in this definition we
 
02:27:55.750 --> 02:27:55.760 align:start position:0%
would suggest probably we don't but we
 
02:27:57.469 --> 02:27:57.479 align:start position:0%
don't know that yet until we've gone
 
02:27:59.790 --> 02:27:59.800 align:start position:0%
through that process of petition and
 
02:28:01.950 --> 02:28:01.960 align:start position:0%
hear the specific concerns of
 
02:28:04.670 --> 02:28:04.680 align:start position:0%
individuals as noted by Mr angers he has
 
02:28:06.429 --> 02:28:06.439 align:start position:0%
seen us over the past several years
 
02:28:08.429 --> 02:28:08.439 align:start position:0%
handle this with other types of issues
 
02:28:10.110 --> 02:28:10.120 align:start position:0%
receiving petitions for rulemaking and
 
02:28:13.710 --> 02:28:13.720 align:start position:0%
trying to resolve them and so uh when
 
02:28:15.269 --> 02:28:15.279 align:start position:0%
the chairman just indicated that there
 
02:28:17.469 --> 02:28:17.479 align:start position:0%
may be a potential to retain the bill
 
02:28:19.030 --> 02:28:19.040 align:start position:0%
what that means is you retain control
 
02:28:21.389 --> 02:28:21.399 align:start position:0%
over the issue and if we in fact receive
 
02:28:23.990 --> 02:28:24.000 align:start position:0%
a petition we can show you how we are in
 
02:28:26.670 --> 02:28:26.680 align:start position:0%
the work in the uh process of resolving
 
02:28:28.790 --> 02:28:28.800 align:start position:0%
this with the constituent in an effort
 
02:28:31.710 --> 02:28:31.720 align:start position:0%
that will cause um minimal harm to our
 
02:28:33.750 --> 02:28:33.760 align:start position:0%
existing scheme of Regulation minimal
 
02:28:36.309 --> 02:28:36.319 align:start position:0%
harm to Timberland owners and minimal
 
02:28:38.710 --> 02:28:38.720 align:start position:0%
concern for others so I would
 
02:28:41.070 --> 02:28:41.080 align:start position:0%
respectfully suggest to you that there
 
02:28:44.309 --> 02:28:44.319 align:start position:0%
is a way under existing law in RSA 541a
 
02:28:46.750 --> 02:28:46.760 align:start position:0%
for us to receive the petition try to to
 
02:28:48.510 --> 02:28:48.520 align:start position:0%
resolve the concerns of the constituent
 
02:28:50.349 --> 02:28:50.359 align:start position:0%
and report back to you on all of those
 
02:28:52.510 --> 02:28:52.520 align:start position:0%
efforts so you can make the policy
 
02:28:54.389 --> 02:28:54.399 align:start position:0%
determination as to we whether or not
 
02:28:58.269 --> 02:28:58.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:00.870 --> 02:29:00.880 align:start position:0%
decision thank you Mr Sanderson any
 
02:29:02.630 --> 02:29:02.640 align:start position:0%
questions from Mr
 
02:29:04.870 --> 02:29:04.880 align:start position:0%
Sanderson represent
 
02:29:07.349 --> 02:29:07.359 align:start position:0%
Spen thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
02:29:10.269 --> 02:29:10.279 align:start position:0%
Paul for taking my question
 
02:29:13.230 --> 02:29:13.240 align:start position:0%
um to shorten up what you just said
 
02:29:15.110 --> 02:29:15.120 align:start position:0%
you're suggesting that if we retain you
 
02:29:17.389 --> 02:29:17.399 align:start position:0%
can work on it and we can judge
 
02:29:19.990 --> 02:29:20.000 align:start position:0%
everything later correct exactly
 
02:29:21.630 --> 02:29:21.640 align:start position:0%
representative this is very similar to
 
02:29:23.590 --> 02:29:23.600 align:start position:0%
the concern that you had raised in a
 
02:29:25.910 --> 02:29:25.920 align:start position:0%
previous session about uh the types of
 
02:29:27.510 --> 02:29:27.520 align:start position:0%
firearms that could be used for taking
 
02:29:29.590 --> 02:29:29.600 align:start position:0%
of turkey that we are resolving through
 
02:29:31.950 --> 02:29:31.960 align:start position:0%
our rulemaking process meanwhile
 
02:29:35.070 --> 02:29:35.080 align:start position:0%
reporting back to the committee on our
 
02:29:38.469 --> 02:29:38.479 align:start position:0%

02:29:50.429 --> 02:29:50.439 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair uh Rick vandero I
 
02:29:53.150 --> 02:29:53.160 align:start position:0%
live in sandwich I'm speaking today on
 
02:29:55.710 --> 02:29:55.720 align:start position:0%
behalf of tin Mountain for which I'm the
 
02:29:58.710 --> 02:29:58.720 align:start position:0%
research director in the last 12 years
 
02:30:01.990 --> 02:30:02.000 align:start position:0%
tin Mountain has restored 24 different
 
02:30:04.990 --> 02:30:05.000 align:start position:0%
streams uh for roughly 26 and a half
 
02:30:07.990 --> 02:30:08.000 align:start position:0%
miles to improve it for trout habitat
 
02:30:10.230 --> 02:30:10.240 align:start position:0%
and as such we have a vested interest in
 
02:30:14.190 --> 02:30:14.200 align:start position:0%
how the definition of wildbrook trout is
 
02:30:17.269 --> 02:30:17.279 align:start position:0%
separate from the generalized Je of
 
02:30:21.150 --> 02:30:21.160 align:start position:0%
trout which includes as the law states
 
02:30:24.150 --> 02:30:24.160 align:start position:0%
rainbow trout brown trout lock lemon
 
02:30:29.070 --> 02:30:29.080 align:start position:0%
trout we have uh Eastern brook trout uh
 
02:30:33.190 --> 02:30:33.200 align:start position:0%
Sal salvelinus falis which is uh our our
 
02:30:37.150 --> 02:30:37.160 align:start position:0%
only native and I would encourage uh as
 
02:30:39.389 --> 02:30:39.399 align:start position:0%
it appears that this bill will be
 
02:30:43.950 --> 02:30:43.960 align:start position:0%
retained that uh we seek to Define wild
 
02:30:46.950 --> 02:30:46.960 align:start position:0%
brook trout independent of the other
 
02:30:50.269 --> 02:30:50.279 align:start position:0%
species so that those of us that are
 
02:30:51.950 --> 02:30:51.960 align:start position:0%
working hard to
 
02:30:55.510 --> 02:30:55.520 align:start position:0%
improve angular opportunities for wild
 
02:30:58.670 --> 02:30:58.680 align:start position:0%
or native trout runs have the option of
 
02:31:01.830 --> 02:31:01.840 align:start position:0%
doing so without having any conflicts of
 
02:31:04.110 --> 02:31:04.120 align:start position:0%
introduced or stock species that are not
 
02:31:07.070 --> 02:31:07.080 align:start position:0%
native so just in in short just if we
 
02:31:10.030 --> 02:31:10.040 align:start position:0%
could encourage the committee to look at
 
02:31:12.590 --> 02:31:12.600 align:start position:0%
a bill that separates the native or wild
 
02:31:14.309 --> 02:31:14.319 align:start position:0%
species out from the others that would
 
02:31:17.150 --> 02:31:17.160 align:start position:0%
be very helpful and I think for your
 
02:31:22.389 --> 02:31:22.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:25.710 --> 02:31:25.720 align:start position:0%
Vandal see them thank you sir is there
 
02:31:26.990 --> 02:31:27.000 align:start position:0%
anybody else who wish to testify in
 
02:31:33.750 --> 02:31:33.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:35.750 --> 02:31:35.760 align:start position:0%
trap Colonel would you mind stepping up
 
02:31:37.710 --> 02:31:37.720 align:start position:0%
to the mic again represent Spain has a
 
02:31:42.230 --> 02:31:42.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:44.790 --> 02:31:44.800 align:start position:0%
you thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
02:31:47.950 --> 02:31:47.960 align:start position:0%
Colonel again um just a question that
 
02:31:50.590 --> 02:31:50.600 align:start position:0%
was brought up to my mind uh that I
 
02:31:53.349 --> 02:31:53.359 align:start position:0%
wanted to ask about as well since we
 
02:31:56.309 --> 02:31:56.319 align:start position:0%
likely May retain this want to ensure
 
02:31:57.630 --> 02:31:57.640 align:start position:0%
that we're working with fish and game on
 
02:31:59.950 --> 02:31:59.960 align:start position:0%
things would the change in definition
 
02:32:02.349 --> 02:32:02.359 align:start position:0%
that specified the Eastern brook trout
 
02:32:04.830 --> 02:32:04.840 align:start position:0%
as the native trout in any way affect
 
02:32:04.840 --> 02:32:05.550 align:start position:0%
as the native trout in any way affect
your

02:32:05.550 --> 02:32:05.560 align:start position:0%
your
 
02:32:08.750 --> 02:32:08.760 align:start position:0%
restocking program it could yes so
 
02:32:11.269 --> 02:32:11.279 align:start position:0%
that's another reason to move slower as
 
02:32:13.309 --> 02:32:13.319 align:start position:0%
as Jason I think Jason alluded to that
 
02:32:15.269 --> 02:32:15.279 align:start position:0%
that could have a long-term effect on
 
02:32:17.110 --> 02:32:17.120 align:start position:0%
how we St
 
02:32:20.429 --> 02:32:20.439 align:start position:0%
fact it may change a particular lot of
 
02:32:22.750 --> 02:32:22.760 align:start position:0%
body that we stocking now on our
 
02:32:25.750 --> 02:32:25.760 align:start position:0%
Ang they taking fish to create a
 
02:32:27.510 --> 02:32:27.520 align:start position:0%
situation where you wouldn't stop that
 
02:32:29.110 --> 02:32:29.120 align:start position:0%
so that's a that's a concern those are
 
02:32:31.030 --> 02:32:31.040 align:start position:0%
definitely different features of bra
 
02:32:34.349 --> 02:32:34.359 align:start position:0%
Point another reason I think to move to
 
02:32:36.910 --> 02:32:36.920 align:start position:0%
retain it and move as a with an
 
02:32:39.190 --> 02:32:39.200 align:start position:0%
opportunity for all these people to have
 
02:32:42.469 --> 02:32:42.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:46.750 --> 02:32:46.760 align:start position:0%
key thank you Colonel uh represent uh
 
02:32:48.349 --> 02:32:48.359 align:start position:0%
there's a gentleman on in attendees
 
02:32:49.950 --> 02:32:49.960 align:start position:0%
named Kevin Kevin if you get State your
 
02:32:51.990 --> 02:32:52.000 align:start position:0%
full name and where you're from and
 
02:32:53.390 --> 02:32:53.400 align:start position:0%
you'll be
 
02:32:53.400 --> 02:33:10.190 align:start position:0%
you'll be
[Music]

02:33:10.190 --> 02:33:10.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:12.870 --> 02:33:12.880 align:start position:0%
unmuted Kevin go ahead
 
02:33:16.230 --> 02:33:16.240 align:start position:0%
sir thank you Mr chairman uh my name is
 
02:33:17.830 --> 02:33:17.840 align:start position:0%
Kevin Gordon I in Bethlehem New
 
02:33:20.590 --> 02:33:20.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I am speaking on behalf of
 
02:33:22.030 --> 02:33:22.040 align:start position:0%
native fish
 
02:33:24.269 --> 02:33:24.279 align:start position:0%
Coalition uh we are speaking in
 
02:33:28.269 --> 02:33:28.279 align:start position:0%
opposition to this bill uh we agree that
 
02:33:29.910 --> 02:33:29.920 align:start position:0%
there is definitely confusion with the
 
02:33:33.670 --> 02:33:33.680 align:start position:0%
current definition of brook trout uh but
 
02:33:35.710 --> 02:33:35.720 align:start position:0%
we would also agree that we would like
 
02:33:39.670 --> 02:33:39.680 align:start position:0%
to see potentially that broaden to cover
 
02:33:42.469 --> 02:33:42.479 align:start position:0%
all the species under the definition of
 
02:33:45.190 --> 02:33:45.200 align:start position:0%
trout being brook trout rainbow trout
 
02:33:46.710 --> 02:33:46.720 align:start position:0%
brown trout
 
02:33:48.550 --> 02:33:48.560 align:start position:0%
and even lake trout you know should be
 
02:33:52.349 --> 02:33:52.359 align:start position:0%
considered there too uh and that way you
 
02:33:55.469 --> 02:33:55.479 align:start position:0%
know instead of defining those other
 
02:33:58.990 --> 02:33:59.000 align:start position:0%
species as brook trout we're defining
 
02:34:02.750 --> 02:34:02.760 align:start position:0%
trout as a general so that the current
 
02:34:05.790 --> 02:34:05.800 align:start position:0%
rules can continue to be enforced but
 
02:34:08.190 --> 02:34:08.200 align:start position:0%
then you know we're kind of clearing up
 
02:34:11.469 --> 02:34:11.479 align:start position:0%
some of that confusion with how brook
 
02:34:14.269 --> 02:34:14.279 align:start position:0%
trout are seen and it would allow the
 
02:34:16.870 --> 02:34:16.880 align:start position:0%
brook trout to be then later defined in
 
02:34:20.510 --> 02:34:20.520 align:start position:0%
more specific rules developed for
 
02:34:25.349 --> 02:34:25.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:27.870 --> 02:34:27.880 align:start position:0%
trout than can qu your first and last
 
02:34:31.710 --> 02:34:31.720 align:start position:0%
name please it's Kevin
 
02:34:34.630 --> 02:34:34.640 align:start position:0%
Gordon and you're from where SMI
 
02:34:37.190 --> 02:34:37.200 align:start position:0%
Bethlehem New Hampshire thank you very
 
02:34:40.830 --> 02:34:40.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:44.150 --> 02:34:44.160 align:start position:0%
Kevin seeing none thank you Kevin next
 
02:34:46.950 --> 02:34:46.960 align:start position:0%
up is Nate Hill
 
02:35:02.710 --> 02:35:02.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:06.590 --> 02:35:06.600 align:start position:0%
yourself goad Mr Hill hi uh my name is
 
02:35:09.670 --> 02:35:09.680 align:start position:0%
Nathan Hill and I am also of native fish
 
02:35:12.469 --> 02:35:12.479 align:start position:0%
Coalition um I had Kevin join me today
 
02:35:14.590 --> 02:35:14.600 align:start position:0%
because I wasn't sure I would be able to
 
02:35:17.510 --> 02:35:17.520 align:start position:0%
get here I'm watching my two kids today
 
02:35:19.710 --> 02:35:19.720 align:start position:0%
um but I would just reiterate what Kevin
 
02:35:22.950 --> 02:35:22.960 align:start position:0%
said we feel that there's definitely um
 
02:35:24.750 --> 02:35:24.760 align:start position:0%
a need to
 
02:35:29.710 --> 02:35:29.720 align:start position:0%
redefine um in our laws the term brook
 
02:35:32.190 --> 02:35:32.200 align:start position:0%
trout uh currently an issue with the
 
02:35:35.190 --> 02:35:35.200 align:start position:0%
term brook trout is that although in in
 
02:35:37.830 --> 02:35:37.840 align:start position:0%
the rules it is defined as representing
 
02:35:41.550 --> 02:35:41.560 align:start position:0%
all fish from a uh law enforcement
 
02:35:43.630 --> 02:35:43.640 align:start position:0%
perspective it's it's a challenge
 
02:35:46.190 --> 02:35:46.200 align:start position:0%
because if somebody does keep other fish
 
02:35:49.950 --> 02:35:49.960 align:start position:0%
or even Brook Trout from a said water um
 
02:35:52.830 --> 02:35:52.840 align:start position:0%
because on the signage it says brook
 
02:35:57.030 --> 02:35:57.040 align:start position:0%
trout um not all species it is not as
 
02:35:58.830 --> 02:35:58.840 align:start position:0%
clear as it could be as to what the
 
02:36:02.190 --> 02:36:02.200 align:start position:0%
current regulations are and we feel that
 
02:36:05.150 --> 02:36:05.160 align:start position:0%
um by defining it as trout it would
 
02:36:07.750 --> 02:36:07.760 align:start position:0%
clarify the definitions while also not
 
02:36:11.510 --> 02:36:11.520 align:start position:0%
misdefined our our native heritage fish
 
02:36:13.710 --> 02:36:13.720 align:start position:0%
which is brook trout and as Kevin said
 
02:36:16.469 --> 02:36:16.479 align:start position:0%
it would allow us to at a later time use
 
02:36:19.030 --> 02:36:19.040 align:start position:0%
the definition definition of brook trout
 
02:36:23.110 --> 02:36:23.120 align:start position:0%
more accurately in in making new laws
 
02:36:23.120 --> 02:36:26.429 align:start position:0%
more accurately in in making new laws
and

02:36:26.429 --> 02:36:26.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:28.630 --> 02:36:28.640 align:start position:0%
rules thank you m Hill any questions
 
02:36:30.550 --> 02:36:30.560 align:start position:0%
from Mr
 
02:36:33.870 --> 02:36:33.880 align:start position:0%
Hill thank you Mr Hill and we'll go to
 
02:36:36.750 --> 02:36:36.760 align:start position:0%
back to uh give the prime sponsor the
 
02:36:39.070 --> 02:36:39.080 align:start position:0%
last conversation point so
 
02:36:41.190 --> 02:36:41.200 align:start position:0%
representative avalene aani if you want
 
02:36:41.200 --> 02:36:42.309 align:start position:0%
representative avalene aani if you want
to

02:36:42.309 --> 02:36:42.319 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:36:44.510 --> 02:36:44.520 align:start position:0%
speak thank you Mr chairman just a
 
02:36:47.950 --> 02:36:47.960 align:start position:0%
question on process um um I missed a
 
02:36:49.630 --> 02:36:49.640 align:start position:0%
gentleman's last name whose name was
 
02:36:52.070 --> 02:36:52.080 align:start position:0%
Paul from fishing game so my apologies
 
02:36:54.469 --> 02:36:54.479 align:start position:0%
for that gentleman um would they be
 
02:36:56.790 --> 02:36:56.800 align:start position:0%
reaching out to Mr Wallace for the
 
02:36:58.630 --> 02:36:58.640 align:start position:0%
petition to change the rules or is that
 
02:37:00.830 --> 02:37:00.840 align:start position:0%
something I need to
 
02:37:02.630 --> 02:37:02.640 align:start position:0%
initiate so I'll answer it and the
 
02:37:04.150 --> 02:37:04.160 align:start position:0%
colonel can shake his head no if I'm
 
02:37:07.349 --> 02:37:07.359 align:start position:0%
wrong um the petition any citizen can
 
02:37:09.030 --> 02:37:09.040 align:start position:0%
put a petition into the fishing Game
 
02:37:10.670 --> 02:37:10.680 align:start position:0%
Commission to have them change a
 
02:37:13.190 --> 02:37:13.200 align:start position:0%
regulation so I think the idea would be
 
02:37:14.950 --> 02:37:14.960 align:start position:0%
someone would SM a petition to fishing
 
02:37:17.309 --> 02:37:17.319 align:start position:0%
game we would retain the bill and
 
02:37:19.070 --> 02:37:19.080 align:start position:0%
fishing game acted in need of the change
 
02:37:20.750 --> 02:37:20.760 align:start position:0%
in law that would give us a vehicle next
 
02:37:22.349 --> 02:37:22.359 align:start position:0%
year to be able to make that change
 
02:37:25.349 --> 02:37:25.359 align:start position:0%
necessary if I did I say that all right
 
02:37:28.870 --> 02:37:28.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:31.150 --> 02:37:31.160 align:start position:0%
right thank you Mr chairman and and just
 
02:37:34.349 --> 02:37:34.359 align:start position:0%
a quick followup if I may you
 
02:37:36.710 --> 02:37:36.720 align:start position:0%
may um would would fishing game be
 
02:37:38.790 --> 02:37:38.800 align:start position:0%
reaching out to Mr Wallace or does Mr
 
02:37:40.110 --> 02:37:40.120 align:start position:0%

keeping my ears open so um so I'm just
 
02:38:15.269 --> 02:38:15.279 align:start position:0%
wondered my next step would be to
 
02:38:15.279 --> 02:38:16.429 align:start position:0%
wondered my next step would be to
contact

02:38:16.429 --> 02:38:16.439 align:start position:0%
contact
 
02:38:16.439 --> 02:38:17.230 align:start position:0%
contact
the

02:38:17.230 --> 02:38:17.240 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:38:19.150 --> 02:38:19.160 align:start position:0%
commission yep just write a letter the
 
02:38:21.309 --> 02:38:21.319 align:start position:0%
fishing game identify the statute and
 
02:38:24.670 --> 02:38:24.680 align:start position:0%
the um fishing games uh regulation you
 
02:38:26.030 --> 02:38:26.040 align:start position:0%
like changed and they will take it from
 
02:38:28.710 --> 02:38:28.720 align:start position:0%
there okay I'm I'm really happy at the
 
02:38:30.630 --> 02:38:30.640 align:start position:0%
process I'm glad the discussion is
 
02:38:33.389 --> 02:38:33.399 align:start position:0%
happening um I from what I understand if
 
02:38:35.070 --> 02:38:35.080 align:start position:0%
like I said if I'm hearing things you
 
02:38:37.269 --> 02:38:37.279 align:start position:0%
guys are just going to sort of put this
 
02:38:39.630 --> 02:38:39.640 align:start position:0%
on hold for a little bit while we look
 
02:38:40.630 --> 02:38:40.640 align:start position:0%
at other
 
02:38:43.190 --> 02:38:43.200 align:start position:0%
ways and if we need to come back and do
 
02:38:44.910 --> 02:38:44.920 align:start position:0%
it I'm just my concern is just to make
 
02:38:47.790 --> 02:38:47.800 align:start position:0%
sure that the guys in those 16 waters
 
02:38:49.510 --> 02:38:49.520 align:start position:0%
you know the brook trout there get get
 
02:38:52.030 --> 02:38:52.040 align:start position:0%
the protection um and if that does it
 
02:38:54.630 --> 02:38:54.640 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm happy there um as I mentioned
 
02:38:56.630 --> 02:38:56.640 align:start position:0%
there was a bunch of conversations you
 
02:38:58.990 --> 02:38:59.000 align:start position:0%
know the ancillary things that sort of
 
02:39:01.750 --> 02:39:01.760 align:start position:0%
you know opening this Pandora's Box May
 
02:39:03.349 --> 02:39:03.359 align:start position:0%
remain that issue which I was hoping to
 
02:39:05.469 --> 02:39:05.479 align:start position:0%
avoid but apparently that's not might
 
02:39:08.469 --> 02:39:08.479 align:start position:0%
not be possible but uh I just want to
 
02:39:09.830 --> 02:39:09.840 align:start position:0%
thank you guys all for your time and the
 
02:39:11.349 --> 02:39:11.359 align:start position:0%

to the discussion um and I will follow
 
02:39:16.510 --> 02:39:16.520 align:start position:0%

on to House Bill 118 Rel of the Fish and
 
02:43:59.510 --> 02:43:59.520 align:start position:0%
Game Commission I recognize
 
02:44:01.230 --> 02:44:01.240 align:start position:0%
representative Harvey for the purpos of
 
02:44:03.349 --> 02:44:03.359 align:start position:0%
introducing her bill representative
 
02:44:11.110 --> 02:44:11.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:13.389 --> 02:44:13.399 align:start position:0%
yours sorry about that thank you Mr
 
02:44:15.750 --> 02:44:15.760 align:start position:0%
chairman and uh I thank committee for
 
02:44:17.870 --> 02:44:17.880 align:start position:0%
letting me uh present this amendment it
 
02:44:20.630 --> 02:44:20.640 align:start position:0%
is really good finally to get to see um
 
02:44:22.030 --> 02:44:22.040 align:start position:0%
some of my friends that I've worked with
 
02:44:24.110 --> 02:44:24.120 align:start position:0%
for a couple years and hopefully over
 
02:44:26.030 --> 02:44:26.040 align:start position:0%
the next uh year or so I'll get to meet
 
02:44:29.950 --> 02:44:29.960 align:start position:0%
the new people so I missed you um so
 
02:44:32.190 --> 02:44:32.200 align:start position:0%
first what I'd like to do is to explain
 
02:44:34.550 --> 02:44:34.560 align:start position:0%
the process that I followed in order to
 
02:44:37.269 --> 02:44:37.279 align:start position:0%
craft this bill because I really do
 
02:44:39.950 --> 02:44:39.960 align:start position:0%
think that a process is just as
 
02:44:41.630 --> 02:44:41.640 align:start position:0%
important if not even more important
 
02:44:45.950 --> 02:44:45.960 align:start position:0%
than the bill itself um we've had
 
02:44:47.990 --> 02:44:48.000 align:start position:0%
uh eight commission bills come before
 
02:44:51.590 --> 02:44:51.600 align:start position:0%
our committee this is the ninth um it's
 
02:44:55.230 --> 02:44:55.240 align:start position:0%
kind of like a merry ground and it's a a
 
02:44:56.910 --> 02:44:56.920 align:start position:0%
little bit of a waste of time and
 
02:45:01.150 --> 02:45:01.160 align:start position:0%
taxpayer dollars so last year as we were
 
02:45:04.349 --> 02:45:04.359 align:start position:0%
debating um the eth commission bill I
 
02:45:06.830 --> 02:45:06.840 align:start position:0%
made a promise from the well that I take
 
02:45:08.030 --> 02:45:08.040 align:start position:0%
very very
 
02:45:10.670 --> 02:45:10.680 align:start position:0%
seriously um that if the legislature
 
02:45:13.830 --> 02:45:13.840 align:start position:0%
would allow me the time to work um I
 
02:45:16.670 --> 02:45:16.680 align:start position:0%
would work with all the parties at the
 
02:45:19.830 --> 02:45:19.840 align:start position:0%
table to Divi to to Define what issues
 
02:45:21.990 --> 02:45:22.000 align:start position:0%
exist and hopefully find a way that we
 
02:45:24.230 --> 02:45:24.240 align:start position:0%
could resolve them so that we can get
 
02:45:27.030 --> 02:45:27.040 align:start position:0%
off this merry ground um this is what
 
02:45:29.510 --> 02:45:29.520 align:start position:0%
legislators are tasked to do they're
 
02:45:31.710 --> 02:45:31.720 align:start position:0%
tasked to find the problems and then to
 
02:45:34.830 --> 02:45:34.840 align:start position:0%
fix them I heard many times this morning
 
02:45:37.309 --> 02:45:37.319 align:start position:0%
uh Colonel Jordan uh saying that some of
 
02:45:41.030 --> 02:45:41.040 align:start position:0%
our um statutes need to be updated and
 
02:45:44.309 --> 02:45:44.319 align:start position:0%
perhaps um this is one of them now I
 
02:45:46.870 --> 02:45:46.880 align:start position:0%
will say Co slowed me down quite a bit
 
02:45:49.349 --> 02:45:49.359 align:start position:0%
but um over the summer and the early
 
02:45:52.230 --> 02:45:52.240 align:start position:0%
fall I was able to contact the oton
 
02:45:55.190 --> 02:45:55.200 align:start position:0%
society uh the Land Conservancy the
 
02:45:57.750 --> 02:45:57.760 align:start position:0%
society for Forest protection um New
 
02:46:00.030 --> 02:46:00.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire fishing game The Wildlife
 
02:46:03.790 --> 02:46:03.800 align:start position:0%
Federation the wildlife Co Coalition um
 
02:46:06.349 --> 02:46:06.359 align:start position:0%
some individual Commissioners and uh
 
02:46:09.510 --> 02:46:09.520 align:start position:0%
some individual past and present um
 
02:46:11.830 --> 02:46:11.840 align:start position:0%
committee members I even contacted New
 
02:46:14.710 --> 02:46:14.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Association of um conservation
 
02:46:17.190 --> 02:46:17.200 align:start position:0%
committ comms which is a commission that
 
02:46:19.750 --> 02:46:19.760 align:start position:0%
oversees all conservation Commissions in
 
02:46:22.790 --> 02:46:22.800 align:start position:0%
the state although they conservation
 
02:46:24.309 --> 02:46:24.319 align:start position:0%
commissions do not come under the
 
02:46:27.190 --> 02:46:27.200 align:start position:0%
purview of New Hampshire fishing game
 
02:46:29.030 --> 02:46:29.040 align:start position:0%
and together um all of these
 
02:46:31.269 --> 02:46:31.279 align:start position:0%
organizations helped me to craft this
 
02:46:34.389 --> 02:46:34.399 align:start position:0%
bill I sent it out to all the parties
 
02:46:36.670 --> 02:46:36.680 align:start position:0%
that I just mentioned and we began
 
02:46:40.150 --> 02:46:40.160 align:start position:0%
negotiations to amend it I spent six
 
02:46:43.710 --> 02:46:43.720 align:start position:0%
hours in two days with New Hampshire
 
02:46:46.550 --> 02:46:46.560 align:start position:0%
fishing game I spoke at the Wildlife
 
02:46:48.870 --> 02:46:48.880 align:start position:0%
Federation December's meeting and I
 
02:46:50.830 --> 02:46:50.840 align:start position:0%
answered many many emails from The Big
 
02:46:53.269 --> 02:46:53.279 align:start position:0%
Three that's the aabon the nature
 
02:46:56.110 --> 02:46:56.120 align:start position:0%
conservancy and um the society for the
 
02:46:57.150 --> 02:46:57.160 align:start position:0%
protection of
 
02:46:59.910 --> 02:46:59.920 align:start position:0%
forest sometimes I was able to input to
 
02:47:02.790 --> 02:47:02.800 align:start position:0%
add their input into the bill sometimes
 
02:47:05.990 --> 02:47:06.000 align:start position:0%
I disagreed and and so I didn't add it
 
02:47:07.870 --> 02:47:07.880 align:start position:0%
but everyone had a chance to speak
 
02:47:10.670 --> 02:47:10.680 align:start position:0%
clearly and um without any kind of
 
02:47:13.950 --> 02:47:13.960 align:start position:0%
animosity so that was the process um I'm
 
02:47:15.550 --> 02:47:15.560 align:start position:0%
not going to go through the the bill
 
02:47:18.190 --> 02:47:18.200 align:start position:0%
word for word because you all can read
 
02:47:21.150 --> 02:47:21.160 align:start position:0%
um but there are uh in my mind there are
 
02:47:24.429 --> 02:47:24.439 align:start position:0%
three big changes in this bill I'm G to
 
02:47:26.670 --> 02:47:26.680 align:start position:0%
start if it's okay with you gonna start
 
02:47:29.150 --> 02:47:29.160 align:start position:0%
with what I would consider the least
 
02:47:31.190 --> 02:47:31.200 align:start position:0%
controversial change and and then I'll
 
02:47:33.429 --> 02:47:33.439 align:start position:0%
work my way towards the most
 
02:47:35.750 --> 02:47:35.760 align:start position:0%
controversial um in my mind the least
 
02:47:38.630 --> 02:47:38.640 align:start position:0%
controversial change is that I have
 
02:47:43.309 --> 02:47:43.319 align:start position:0%
added e ecology as a possible area of
 
02:47:45.830 --> 02:47:45.840 align:start position:0%
expertise to qualify if to become a
 
02:47:49.830 --> 02:47:49.840 align:start position:0%
commission but I did limit that ecology
 
02:47:51.710 --> 02:47:51.720 align:start position:0%
to fish and game
 
02:47:54.389 --> 02:47:54.399 align:start position:0%
ecology I think the term is Broad enough
 
02:47:56.670 --> 02:47:56.680 align:start position:0%
that way to include how things like how
 
02:47:59.110 --> 02:47:59.120 align:start position:0%
animals survive how they depend on each
 
02:48:04.230 --> 02:48:04.240 align:start position:0%
other how their habitats um um correlate
 
02:48:05.630 --> 02:48:05.640 align:start position:0%
with each other how they interact with
 
02:48:09.469 --> 02:48:09.479 align:start position:0%
humans Etc but the term is narrow enough
 
02:48:12.469 --> 02:48:12.479 align:start position:0%
to to just talk about fishing game um as
 
02:48:14.030 --> 02:48:14.040 align:start position:0%
important as it is I really don't care
 
02:48:16.309 --> 02:48:16.319 align:start position:0%
about the ecology of the rainforest
 
02:48:19.790 --> 02:48:19.800 align:start position:0%
canopy um courses and I looked the
 
02:48:21.429 --> 02:48:21.439 align:start position:0%
reason I included it was because I
 
02:48:26.510 --> 02:48:26.520 align:start position:0%
looked at courses that um are offered
 
02:48:29.190 --> 02:48:29.200 align:start position:0%
when you begin a study of ecology and
 
02:48:33.150 --> 02:48:33.160 align:start position:0%
the courses revolve a great deal around
 
02:48:35.910 --> 02:48:35.920 align:start position:0%
Gathering field data and compiling that
 
02:48:37.990 --> 02:48:38.000 align:start position:0%
data and that's exactly what fishing
 
02:48:41.429 --> 02:48:41.439 align:start position:0%
game does when it sets its uh rules and
 
02:48:43.750 --> 02:48:43.760 align:start position:0%
regulations for hunting and and trapping
 
02:48:45.230 --> 02:48:45.240 align:start position:0%
and fishing which we've Ted talked about
 
02:48:47.349 --> 02:48:47.359 align:start position:0%
so so much this
 
02:48:49.950 --> 02:48:49.960 align:start position:0%
morning uh then if I skip back to the
 
02:48:51.950 --> 02:48:51.960 align:start position:0%
beginning of the bill uh one one of the
 
02:48:54.349 --> 02:48:54.359 align:start position:0%
biggest changes is the term sporting
 
02:48:57.429 --> 02:48:57.439 align:start position:0%
clubs was changed to nominating clubs
 
02:48:59.389 --> 02:48:59.399 align:start position:0%
because at this point in the bill that's
 
02:49:01.990 --> 02:49:02.000 align:start position:0%
what they're doing they are submitting a
 
02:49:04.830 --> 02:49:04.840 align:start position:0%
nomination um to the governor as a
 
02:49:07.630 --> 02:49:07.640 align:start position:0%
possible U candidate for a commission
 
02:49:12.590 --> 02:49:12.600 align:start position:0%
when there is an open seat um we in my
 
02:49:14.150 --> 02:49:14.160 align:start position:0%
meeting with New Hampshire fishing game
 
02:49:17.070 --> 02:49:17.080 align:start position:0%
we must spent an hour on that just that
 
02:49:19.469 --> 02:49:19.479 align:start position:0%
term and I I believe um it was
 
02:49:21.229 --> 02:49:21.239 align:start position:0%
commissioner Hodgkins that came up with
 
02:49:24.150 --> 02:49:24.160 align:start position:0%
that term and and I agreed to it because
 
02:49:27.750 --> 02:49:27.760 align:start position:0%
I I think that very clearly defines what
 
02:49:30.750 --> 02:49:30.760 align:start position:0%
the organization is doing at that point
 
02:49:32.429 --> 02:49:32.439 align:start position:0%
the biggest issue and probably the
 
02:49:34.910 --> 02:49:34.920 align:start position:0%
elephant in the room and that is the
 
02:49:36.550 --> 02:49:36.560 align:start position:0%
requirement to have a hunting fishing or
 
02:49:39.269 --> 02:49:39.279 align:start position:0%
traffing license many there's many
 
02:49:41.670 --> 02:49:41.680 align:start position:0%
legislators out there who want this
 
02:49:45.229 --> 02:49:45.239 align:start position:0%
requirement to be omitted um they argue
 
02:49:47.590 --> 02:49:47.600 align:start position:0%
that it's capricious that it's
 
02:49:52.070 --> 02:49:52.080 align:start position:0%
unnecessary um I don't agree I I see the
 
02:49:53.750 --> 02:49:53.760 align:start position:0%
value of the education and the
 
02:49:55.269 --> 02:49:55.279 align:start position:0%
experience that comes with having a
 
02:49:57.750 --> 02:49:57.760 align:start position:0%
license equally and fairly applied to
 
02:50:02.229 --> 02:50:02.239 align:start position:0%
every County in our state however I do
 
02:50:05.750 --> 02:50:05.760 align:start position:0%
believe that five years is way too long
 
02:50:09.790 --> 02:50:09.800 align:start position:0%
in our mobile and our modern society
 
02:50:12.469 --> 02:50:12.479 align:start position:0%
lives especially during this pandemic
 
02:50:15.269 --> 02:50:15.279 align:start position:0%
have changed on a dime jobs have been
 
02:50:18.510 --> 02:50:18.520 align:start position:0%
lost or jobs have been gained um
 
02:50:20.150 --> 02:50:20.160 align:start position:0%
additional responsibilities have entered
 
02:50:23.349 --> 02:50:23.359 align:start position:0%
the family in terms of um aging parents
 
02:50:25.590 --> 02:50:25.600 align:start position:0%
or children
 
02:50:29.070 --> 02:50:29.080 align:start position:0%
um the the whole family unit has become
 
02:50:32.710 --> 02:50:32.720 align:start position:0%
redefined and so uh this amendment
 
02:50:35.630 --> 02:50:35.640 align:start position:0%
allows the time limit to hold a license
 
02:50:39.269 --> 02:50:39.279 align:start position:0%
to a much more realistic period of time
 
02:50:42.429 --> 02:50:42.439 align:start position:0%
because it changes it from five out of
 
02:50:44.389 --> 02:50:44.399 align:start position:0%
the previous 10 years to four out of the
 
02:50:48.190 --> 02:50:48.200 align:start position:0%
prev previous seven it still allows four
 
02:50:50.950 --> 02:50:50.960 align:start position:0%
years to gain the experience of hunting
 
02:50:52.389 --> 02:50:52.399 align:start position:0%
fishing and
 
02:50:54.790 --> 02:50:54.800 align:start position:0%
trapping I think our state could
 
02:50:57.510 --> 02:50:57.520 align:start position:0%
actually benefit from Commissioners who
 
02:50:59.790 --> 02:50:59.800 align:start position:0%
possibly hold their license their first
 
02:51:02.630 --> 02:51:02.640 align:start position:0%
license for a somewhat shorter period of
 
02:51:05.349 --> 02:51:05.359 align:start position:0%
time uh because those are the people who
 
02:51:09.389 --> 02:51:09.399 align:start position:0%
might be I'm sorry uh rep can you make
 
02:51:10.950 --> 02:51:10.960 align:start position:0%
sure you delineate if you're speaking
 
02:51:12.469 --> 02:51:12.479 align:start position:0%
about the original underlying bill or
 
02:51:13.830 --> 02:51:13.840 align:start position:0%
your Amendment because you're
 
02:51:15.670 --> 02:51:15.680 align:start position:0%
complicating two together and I'm not
 
02:51:17.349 --> 02:51:17.359 align:start position:0%
sure if people following the bill which
 
02:51:20.070 --> 02:51:20.080 align:start position:0%
is on online and not your Amendment they
 
02:51:21.389 --> 02:51:21.399 align:start position:0%
don't know what the differential is
 
02:51:22.670 --> 02:51:22.680 align:start position:0%
between what you're speaking about thank
 
02:51:24.190 --> 02:51:24.200 align:start position:0%
you for the correction I I am really
 
02:51:25.670 --> 02:51:25.680 align:start position:0%
only speaking to the
 
02:51:29.110 --> 02:51:29.120 align:start position:0%
amendment okay um was that what I was
 
02:51:31.510 --> 02:51:31.520 align:start position:0%
tasked to
 
02:51:33.990 --> 02:51:34.000 align:start position:0%
do the amendment's not technically
 
02:51:35.870 --> 02:51:35.880 align:start position:0%
before the committee I'll allow you to
 
02:51:38.670 --> 02:51:38.680 align:start position:0%
speak you on it but keep it kind of keep
 
02:51:39.590 --> 02:51:39.600 align:start position:0%
it short so we haven't had a
 
02:51:40.910 --> 02:51:40.920 align:start position:0%
deliberation we haven't adopted the
 
02:51:43.229 --> 02:51:43.239 align:start position:0%
amendment so right now what's in front
 
02:51:45.469 --> 02:51:45.479 align:start position:0%
of the committee is the or
 
02:51:49.389 --> 02:51:49.399 align:start position:0%
um Bill okay and so I'm sorry um
 
02:51:50.950 --> 02:51:50.960 align:start position:0%
obviously I was daydreaming when you
 
02:51:53.070 --> 02:51:53.080 align:start position:0%
gave me those instructions so I I missed
 
02:51:57.990 --> 02:51:58.000 align:start position:0%
it but anyway um so um I do think that
 
02:52:00.269 --> 02:52:00.279 align:start position:0%
five years is a long time I want
 
02:52:03.269 --> 02:52:03.279 align:start position:0%
Commissioners who who are possibly
 
02:52:04.870 --> 02:52:04.880 align:start position:0%
having their license for the very first
 
02:52:08.030 --> 02:52:08.040 align:start position:0%
time um who are excited to get out there
 
02:52:11.950 --> 02:52:11.960 align:start position:0%
and and experience their sport um I
 
02:52:15.510 --> 02:52:15.520 align:start position:0%
think sometimes sometimes um after
 
02:52:17.070 --> 02:52:17.080 align:start position:0%
you've had a license for a long period
 
02:52:18.990 --> 02:52:19.000 align:start position:0%
of time you can wake up in the morning
 
02:52:21.830 --> 02:52:21.840 align:start position:0%
and say it's cold outside there's snow
 
02:52:24.110 --> 02:52:24.120 align:start position:0%
on the ground um I think I'll just stay
 
02:52:27.070 --> 02:52:27.080 align:start position:0%
in bed where someone with a brand new
 
02:52:30.190 --> 02:52:30.200 align:start position:0%
license would say it it's cold outside
 
02:52:32.030 --> 02:52:32.040 align:start position:0%
there's snow on the ground and I can't
 
02:52:33.790 --> 02:52:33.800 align:start position:0%
wait to get my boots on and go out and
 
02:52:38.229 --> 02:52:38.239 align:start position:0%
and Hunt um so this allows
 
02:52:42.190 --> 02:52:42.200 align:start position:0%
um this allows some fresh new blood onto
 
02:52:45.110 --> 02:52:45.120 align:start position:0%
the commission it and yet it still
 
02:52:47.670 --> 02:52:47.680 align:start position:0%
allows a commitment
 
02:52:50.389 --> 02:52:50.399 align:start position:0%
because up until now you did not have to
 
02:52:51.990 --> 02:52:52.000 align:start position:0%
have a license while you were on the
 
02:52:54.389 --> 02:52:54.399 align:start position:0%
commission you had to have it five years
 
02:52:57.590 --> 02:52:57.600 align:start position:0%
before but not after you became a
 
02:53:00.790 --> 02:53:00.800 align:start position:0%
commissioner so
 
02:53:04.429 --> 02:53:04.439 align:start position:0%
by by um ensuring that you keep your
 
02:53:06.830 --> 02:53:06.840 align:start position:0%
license while you were on the commission
 
02:53:08.950 --> 02:53:08.960 align:start position:0%
I've actually lengthened the time of
 
02:53:13.349 --> 02:53:13.359 align:start position:0%
commitment um and I think that's uh very
 
02:53:15.510 --> 02:53:15.520 align:start position:0%
important because it does show a
 
02:53:18.110 --> 02:53:18.120 align:start position:0%
commitment to New Hampshire fishing
 
02:53:20.670 --> 02:53:20.680 align:start position:0%
game so I you've seen the bill you've
 
02:53:20.680 --> 02:53:21.870 align:start position:0%
game so I you've seen the bill you've
seen

02:53:21.870 --> 02:53:21.880 align:start position:0%
seen
 
02:53:24.870 --> 02:53:24.880 align:start position:0%
um a long time uh you've had it in your
 
02:53:26.389 --> 02:53:26.399 align:start position:0%
possession for a long time now I'm not
 
02:53:28.030 --> 02:53:28.040 align:start position:0%
going to go through every single thing
 
02:53:30.070 --> 02:53:30.080 align:start position:0%
in it but if you have any questions I'll
 
02:53:33.030 --> 02:53:33.040 align:start position:0%
be glad to answer them at this
 
02:53:35.309 --> 02:53:35.319 align:start position:0%
point Thank you any questions for
 
02:53:35.319 --> 02:53:39.990 align:start position:0%
point Thank you any questions for
representative

02:53:39.990 --> 02:53:40.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:44.389 --> 02:53:44.399 align:start position:0%
Harvey I have one sure so you in
 
02:53:46.550 --> 02:53:46.560 align:start position:0%
speaking about licenses and and the
 
02:53:48.349 --> 02:53:48.359 align:start position:0%
number the number of years you must have
 
02:53:50.990 --> 02:53:51.000 align:start position:0%
a license is isn't it an
 
02:53:53.710 --> 02:53:53.720 align:start position:0%
indicator how do I want to word this I
 
02:53:54.710 --> 02:53:54.720 align:start position:0%
guess I'm trying to struggle with the
 
02:53:56.229 --> 02:53:56.239 align:start position:0%
idea of a person having a license for
 
02:53:59.110 --> 02:53:59.120 align:start position:0%
one year understanding setting policy
 
02:54:00.910 --> 02:54:00.920 align:start position:0%
for hunters who have been hunting for 20
 
02:54:03.950 --> 02:54:03.960 align:start position:0%
years I I did not put one year in
 
02:54:06.630 --> 02:54:06.640 align:start position:0%
anywhere you spoke about that brand new
 
02:54:08.550 --> 02:54:08.560 align:start position:0%
fish hunterman who's going out and I was
 
02:54:10.710 --> 02:54:10.720 align:start position:0%
I was speaking to your comments um not
 
02:54:12.150 --> 02:54:12.160 align:start position:0%
necessarily the bill itself what you had
 
02:54:14.429 --> 02:54:14.439 align:start position:0%
stated about new hunters and stuff so
 
02:54:16.750 --> 02:54:16.760 align:start position:0%
the original bill um that I submitted
 
02:54:19.670 --> 02:54:19.680 align:start position:0%
118 the original bill it's two out of
 
02:54:24.269 --> 02:54:24.279 align:start position:0%
the previous uh seven years and if you
 
02:54:26.389 --> 02:54:26.399 align:start position:0%
allow me um in the amendment it's four
 
02:54:28.550 --> 02:54:28.560 align:start position:0%
out of the previous seven but there was
 
02:54:31.630 --> 02:54:31.640 align:start position:0%
never a one okay thank you I I was
 
02:54:33.550 --> 02:54:33.560 align:start position:0%
assuming that somebody with just two or
 
02:54:38.030 --> 02:54:38.040 align:start position:0%
three years is still a newbie thank you
 
02:54:40.150 --> 02:54:40.160 align:start position:0%

allowed to take them over but I emailed
 
02:56:15.710 --> 02:56:15.720 align:start position:0%
them to house community services and I
 
02:56:18.790 --> 02:56:18.800 align:start position:0%
asked house Community Services to please
 
02:56:21.710 --> 02:56:21.720 align:start position:0%
um distribute them to committee members
 
02:56:23.910 --> 02:56:23.920 align:start position:0%
I also ask them to distribute them to
 
02:56:25.630 --> 02:56:25.640 align:start position:0%
the sponsors I didn't check on whether
 
02:56:28.030 --> 02:56:28.040 align:start position:0%
they went to the sponsors or not um and
 
02:56:30.790 --> 02:56:30.800 align:start position:0%
I asked if they could please make a few
 
02:56:33.790 --> 02:56:33.800 align:start position:0%
um hard copies uh which they were going
 
02:56:35.870 --> 02:56:35.880 align:start position:0%
to put on the table because I knew some
 
02:56:38.110 --> 02:56:38.120 align:start position:0%
people sorry some people were going to
 
02:56:41.990 --> 02:56:42.000 align:start position:0%
attend today in person and and not be
 
02:56:47.269 --> 02:56:47.279 align:start position:0%
remote so so it was
 
02:56:51.030 --> 02:56:51.040 align:start position:0%
Anthony oh gosh I can't
 
02:56:54.510 --> 02:56:54.520 align:start position:0%
Delan I don't even want to attempt to
 
02:56:56.269 --> 02:56:56.279 align:start position:0%
pronounce his last name because I'll
 
02:57:00.790 --> 02:57:00.800 align:start position:0%
screw it up so badly yeah Anthony in OLS
 
02:57:02.950 --> 02:57:02.960 align:start position:0%
also helped uh craft the bill and he was
 
02:57:04.790 --> 02:57:04.800 align:start position:0%
the one that sent it to house community
 
02:57:07.309 --> 02:57:07.319 align:start position:0%
services and then when I approved the
 
02:57:10.630 --> 02:57:10.640 align:start position:0%
bill um house Community Services emailed
 
02:57:14.429 --> 02:57:14.439 align:start position:0%
it out and I in this Co world I n quite
 
02:57:17.309 --> 02:57:17.319 align:start position:0%
sure how to how this works so I um
 
02:57:20.950 --> 02:57:20.960 align:start position:0%
called the chair and asked him you know
 
02:57:23.070 --> 02:57:23.080 align:start position:0%
how do I do this and this is what he
 
02:57:23.080 --> 02:57:23.990 align:start position:0%
how do I do this and this is what he
told

02:57:23.990 --> 02:57:24.000 align:start position:0%
told
 
02:57:28.030 --> 02:57:28.040 align:start position:0%

02:57:39.870 --> 02:57:39.880 align:start position:0%
incorrect okay thank you chairman thank

great yes thank you chairman Lang can
 
02:58:29.950 --> 02:58:29.960 align:start position:0%
you hear me we can go ahead okay I I'm
 
02:58:33.590 --> 02:58:33.600 align:start position:0%
here to support the bill um for a number
 
02:58:38.110 --> 02:58:38.120 align:start position:0%
of years now um we at the New Hampshire
 
02:58:41.309 --> 02:58:41.319 align:start position:0%
wildlife Coalition have been advocating
 
02:58:44.510 --> 02:58:44.520 align:start position:0%
for a democratization with the the small
 
02:58:48.750 --> 02:58:48.760 align:start position:0%
d uh of the commission we think that the
 
02:58:51.190 --> 02:58:51.200 align:start position:0%
commission is not representative of the
 
02:58:54.910 --> 02:58:54.920 align:start position:0%
people of New Hampshire we know how many
 
02:59:00.349 --> 02:59:00.359 align:start position:0%
um people who enjoy hunting and enjoy
 
02:59:03.830 --> 02:59:03.840 align:start position:0%
um uh wildlife in general and are very
 
02:59:05.910 --> 02:59:05.920 align:start position:0%
supportive of New Hampshire fishing game
 
02:59:09.790 --> 02:59:09.800 align:start position:0%
donate may not have licenses but donate
 
02:59:13.670 --> 02:59:13.680 align:start position:0%
and and donate to the non-game fund Etc
 
02:59:15.750 --> 02:59:15.760 align:start position:0%
but are discouraged by the lack of a
 
02:59:18.229 --> 02:59:18.239 align:start position:0%
voice that they appear to have on the
 
02:59:21.269 --> 02:59:21.279 align:start position:0%
commission um we think that the way that
 
02:59:23.870 --> 02:59:23.880 align:start position:0%
the bill is written
 
02:59:27.670 --> 02:59:27.680 align:start position:0%
now is um largely a pretty good bill I
 
02:59:31.950 --> 02:59:31.960 align:start position:0%
think it is um representative of both
 
02:59:35.150 --> 02:59:35.160 align:start position:0%
sides really and I support
 
02:59:37.469 --> 02:59:37.479 align:start position:0%
representative Spain's effort on this
 
02:59:39.830 --> 02:59:39.840 align:start position:0%
and thank you by the
 
02:59:42.349 --> 02:59:42.359 align:start position:0%
way um I
 
02:59:44.750 --> 02:59:44.760 align:start position:0%
would um you know I've been reading
 
02:59:50.309 --> 02:59:50.319 align:start position:0%
about what folks who fear this um Bill
 
02:59:52.550 --> 02:59:52.560 align:start position:0%
have been saying that the antis are
 
02:59:55.710 --> 02:59:55.720 align:start position:0%
coming to destroy hunting rights by
 
02:59:59.990 --> 03:00:00.000 align:start position:0%
wanting a seat on this commission um you
 
03:00:01.750 --> 03:00:01.760 align:start position:0%
know and and of course that's the old
 
03:00:04.550 --> 03:00:04.560 align:start position:0%
saw that the anti are coming I'm not an
 
03:00:06.469 --> 03:00:06.479 align:start position:0%
anti the New Hampshire wildlife
 
03:00:08.030 --> 03:00:08.040 align:start position:0%
Coalition is not an
 
03:00:10.630 --> 03:00:10.640 align:start position:0%
anti most of the people that support
 
03:00:13.190 --> 03:00:13.200 align:start position:0%
this bill are not anti we want to
 
03:00:16.710 --> 03:00:16.720 align:start position:0%
promote good good sound ethical
 
03:00:19.670 --> 03:00:19.680 align:start position:0%
hunting and unethical hunting as you
 
03:00:21.429 --> 03:00:21.439 align:start position:0%
probably agree with me should not be
 
03:00:24.550 --> 03:00:24.560 align:start position:0%
happening anyway so I think that having
 
03:00:27.229 --> 03:00:27.239 align:start position:0%
a few voices on this commission should
 
03:00:29.389 --> 03:00:29.399 align:start position:0%
not be something that's perceived as
 
03:00:31.590 --> 03:00:31.600 align:start position:0%
threatening it should be something that
 
03:00:34.710 --> 03:00:34.720 align:start position:0%
is perceived as a way to bring more
 
03:00:38.710 --> 03:00:38.720 align:start position:0%
people into supporting the goals and the
 
03:00:41.269 --> 03:00:41.279 align:start position:0%
the mission of the New Hampshire fishing
 
03:00:43.750 --> 03:00:43.760 align:start position:0%
game that's all I have to say thank
 
03:00:46.790 --> 03:00:46.800 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you Chris is there any
 
03:00:50.070 --> 03:00:50.080 align:start position:0%
questions for um
 
03:00:53.469 --> 03:00:53.479 align:start position:0%
Chris uh represent shirt with go ahead
 
03:00:57.349 --> 03:00:57.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:59.790 --> 03:00:59.800 align:start position:0%
sorry thank you Mr chairman just a point
 
03:01:03.349 --> 03:01:03.359 align:start position:0%
of clarification with Miss chamblet um
 
03:01:05.710 --> 03:01:05.720 align:start position:0%
we had the original Bill introduced by
 
03:01:08.229 --> 03:01:08.239 align:start position:0%
representative Javi but we you speaking
 
03:01:12.269 --> 03:01:12.279 align:start position:0%
in support of the original Bill the Javy
 
03:01:14.670 --> 03:01:14.680 align:start position:0%
Amendment or the SP Amendment because I
 
03:01:16.150 --> 03:01:16.160 align:start position:0%
know you mentioned representative Spain
 
03:01:18.190 --> 03:01:18.200 align:start position:0%
in your testimony I just want to be
 
03:01:20.830 --> 03:01:20.840 align:start position:0%
clear yeah thank you I should have been
 
03:01:24.229 --> 03:01:24.239 align:start position:0%
more clear as well I represent
 
03:01:27.229 --> 03:01:27.239 align:start position:0%
the I I don't represent either uh
 
03:01:29.670 --> 03:01:29.680 align:start position:0%
support of either amendment I am I'm in
 
03:01:34.110 --> 03:01:34.120 align:start position:0%
support of the general bill so um the
 
03:01:36.429 --> 03:01:36.439 align:start position:0%
number of years that licenses are
 
03:01:40.309 --> 03:01:40.319 align:start position:0%
required matters actually less to me and
 
03:01:42.790 --> 03:01:42.800 align:start position:0%
I think many other people than does the
 
03:01:46.590 --> 03:01:46.600 align:start position:0%
idea of having um some scientific voice
 
03:01:48.469 --> 03:01:48.479 align:start position:0%
on the commission so that's what I was
 
03:01:51.190 --> 03:01:51.200 align:start position:0%
speaking to thank you I appreciate that
 
03:01:53.190 --> 03:01:53.200 align:start position:0%
clarification thank you Mr
 
03:01:56.710 --> 03:01:56.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:01.550 --> 03:02:01.560 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you next up
 
03:02:06.229 --> 03:02:06.239 align:start position:0%
is JB uh BJ wall uh representing himself
 
03:02:08.309 --> 03:02:08.319 align:start position:0%
in support of the
 
03:02:11.110 --> 03:02:11.120 align:start position:0%
bill hi my name is BJ wall and I live in
 
03:02:14.750 --> 03:02:14.760 align:start position:0%
Sullivan New Hampshire and I've dis been
 
03:02:16.910 --> 03:02:16.920 align:start position:0%
very dismayed about the makeup of the
 
03:02:19.190 --> 03:02:19.200 align:start position:0%
fishing Game Commission and actually
 
03:02:21.590 --> 03:02:21.600 align:start position:0%
even angry because I feel that it does
 
03:02:25.389 --> 03:02:25.399 align:start position:0%
not represent the citizenry of the State
 
03:02:28.229 --> 03:02:28.239 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire and that's because only
 
03:02:30.550 --> 03:02:30.560 align:start position:0%
a very small minority of the population
 
03:02:31.510 --> 03:02:31.520 align:start position:0%
it's about
 
03:02:35.030 --> 03:02:35.040 align:start position:0%
3.6% last time I looked holds a hunting
 
03:02:38.870 --> 03:02:38.880 align:start position:0%
license and more hold fishing licenses
 
03:02:40.870 --> 03:02:40.880 align:start position:0%
that's true but um the makeup of the
 
03:02:44.190 --> 03:02:44.200 align:start position:0%
fishing Game Commission is 100% Fishers
 
03:02:47.469 --> 03:02:47.479 align:start position:0%
and Trappers and that really doesn't
 
03:02:48.990 --> 03:02:49.000 align:start position:0%
represent the population in New
 
03:02:51.710 --> 03:02:51.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so I feel like none of us have
 
03:02:55.030 --> 03:02:55.040 align:start position:0%
a voice on this commission and so I'm
 
03:02:57.309 --> 03:02:57.319 align:start position:0%
definitely in support of the bill I'm
 
03:03:00.910 --> 03:03:00.920 align:start position:0%
not exactly clear on which amendment um
 
03:03:04.070 --> 03:03:04.080 align:start position:0%
says that three people have to or three
 
03:03:07.190 --> 03:03:07.200 align:start position:0%
people may not have hunting fishing or
 
03:03:09.870 --> 03:03:09.880 align:start position:0%
trapping licenses but whatever Amendment
 
03:03:11.990 --> 03:03:12.000 align:start position:0%
does that I think I'm in favor of too I
 
03:03:15.910 --> 03:03:15.920 align:start position:0%
I don't think even having just three
 
03:03:18.590 --> 03:03:18.600 align:start position:0%
non-hunters on the commission is good
 
03:03:23.150 --> 03:03:23.160 align:start position:0%
enough because you know 96% of the
 
03:03:26.870 --> 03:03:26.880 align:start position:0%
population doesn't hunt fish or trap so
 
03:03:29.910 --> 03:03:29.920 align:start position:0%
really I would like to see it sort of
 
03:03:32.990 --> 03:03:33.000 align:start position:0%
open however that's not what the
 
03:03:35.990 --> 03:03:36.000 align:start position:0%
Amendments read as of now so I would
 
03:03:38.750 --> 03:03:38.760 align:start position:0%
support the one that at least allows
 
03:03:38.760 --> 03:03:41.110 align:start position:0%
support the one that at least allows
three

03:03:41.110 --> 03:03:41.120 align:start position:0%
three
 
03:03:43.870 --> 03:03:43.880 align:start position:0%
non-consumptive and well-educated
 
03:03:46.269 --> 03:03:46.279 align:start position:0%
Outdoors people on the
 
03:03:49.590 --> 03:03:49.600 align:start position:0%
commission I think that's all I need to
 
03:03:54.710 --> 03:03:54.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:57.990 --> 03:03:58.000 align:start position:0%
wall seeing none thank you Miss wall
 
03:03:59.590 --> 03:03:59.600 align:start position:0%
next up
 
03:03:59.600 --> 03:04:01.670 align:start position:0%

trying to solve and are there decisions
 
03:05:33.550 --> 03:05:33.560 align:start position:0%
that are being made specifically by the

New Hampshire Fish and Game Commission
 
03:05:37.309 --> 03:05:37.319 align:start position:0%

risk the answer to these questions is a

resounding no New Hampshire fishing game

I'm here today to ask you to support
 
03:06:34.510 --> 03:06:34.520 align:start position:0%
hb18 and the amendment to the bill in my
 
03:06:36.229 --> 03:06:36.239 align:start position:0%
opinion the commission of the
 
03:06:37.750 --> 03:06:37.760 align:start position:0%
composition of the New Hampshire fishing
 
03:06:39.670 --> 03:06:39.680 align:start position:0%
Game Commission needs to better
 
03:06:41.950 --> 03:06:41.960 align:start position:0%
represent the citizens of New Hampshire
 
03:06:43.750 --> 03:06:43.760 align:start position:0%
the wild animals in our state are a
 
03:06:45.710 --> 03:06:45.720 align:start position:0%
natural resource and all our citizens
 
03:06:47.309 --> 03:06:47.319 align:start position:0%
should have a say in how they are
 
03:06:49.630 --> 03:06:49.640 align:start position:0%
treated only a tiny fraction of the
 
03:06:51.469 --> 03:06:51.479 align:start position:0%
state population has a hunting or
 
03:06:53.710 --> 03:06:53.720 align:start position:0%
fishing license and according to current
 
03:06:55.389 --> 03:06:55.399 align:start position:0%
law this group of individuals are the
 
03:06:57.710 --> 03:06:57.720 align:start position:0%
only citizens allowed to sit on the
 
03:06:59.750 --> 03:06:59.760 align:start position:0%
fishing Game Commission the current
 
03:07:01.950 --> 03:07:01.960 align:start position:0%
makeup commission is a glaring example
 
03:07:04.590 --> 03:07:04.600 align:start position:0%
of minority rule this small group of
 
03:07:06.630 --> 03:07:06.640 align:start position:0%
license holders have been given the
 
03:07:09.349 --> 03:07:09.359 align:start position:0%
right by law to decide how many of our
 
03:07:12.110 --> 03:07:12.120 align:start position:0%
wild animals are killed each year in New
 
03:07:14.790 --> 03:07:14.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and as a note New Hampshire is
 
03:07:17.429 --> 03:07:17.439 align:start position:0%
the only state in the US whose Fish and
 
03:07:19.910 --> 03:07:19.920 align:start position:0%
Game Commission requires that all
 
03:07:23.030 --> 03:07:23.040 align:start position:0%
members have a license I've attended
 
03:07:24.870 --> 03:07:24.880 align:start position:0%
many Fish and Game Commission meetings
 
03:07:27.389 --> 03:07:27.399 align:start position:0%
over the past several years and on
 
03:07:29.469 --> 03:07:29.479 align:start position:0%
several occasions I've listened to staff
 
03:07:32.309 --> 03:07:32.319 align:start position:0%
biologists testify to declining fur
 
03:07:34.870 --> 03:07:34.880 align:start position:0%
bearing populations and recommend that
 
03:07:37.309 --> 03:07:37.319 align:start position:0%
hunting and trapping limits be lowered
 
03:07:39.550 --> 03:07:39.560 align:start position:0%
each time the commission voted to
 
03:07:42.469 --> 03:07:42.479 align:start position:0%
continue with the existing limits I was
 
03:07:44.710 --> 03:07:44.720 align:start position:0%
also at the meeting where the biologist
 
03:07:47.389 --> 03:07:47.399 align:start position:0%
recommended a break in the year round
 
03:07:49.349 --> 03:07:49.359 align:start position:0%
coyote hunting season for a couple of
 
03:07:51.830 --> 03:07:51.840 align:start position:0%
months so that they could have a safe
 
03:07:54.670 --> 03:07:54.680 align:start position:0%
period to raise their pups again the
 
03:07:56.990 --> 03:07:57.000 align:start position:0%
commission chose not to follow the
 
03:07:57.000 --> 03:07:58.630 align:start position:0%
commission chose not to follow the
biologist

03:07:58.630 --> 03:07:58.640 align:start position:0%
biologist
 
03:08:00.870 --> 03:08:00.880 align:start position:0%
recommendation I hope that being able to
 
03:08:02.429 --> 03:08:02.439 align:start position:0%
have commission members with a view
 
03:08:04.830 --> 03:08:04.840 align:start position:0%
towards conservation and educational
 
03:08:07.750 --> 03:08:07.760 align:start position:0%
backgrounds in this field as the
 
03:08:09.710 --> 03:08:09.720 align:start position:0%
amendment proposes would create an
 
03:08:11.870 --> 03:08:11.880 align:start position:0%
environment that would give more weight
 
03:08:14.790 --> 03:08:14.800 align:start position:0%
to the recommendations of the biologists
 
03:08:17.790 --> 03:08:17.800 align:start position:0%
this can only benefit all of New
 
03:08:21.550 --> 03:08:21.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's wildlife and its
 
03:08:24.590 --> 03:08:24.600 align:start position:0%
citizens a wildlife agency's primary
 
03:08:27.190 --> 03:08:27.200 align:start position:0%
mission is not only to serve Sportsmen
 
03:08:29.229 --> 03:08:29.239 align:start position:0%
but to protect the wildlife that is a
 
03:08:31.950 --> 03:08:31.960 align:start position:0%
resource that belongs to all of us the
 
03:08:34.150 --> 03:08:34.160 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire fishing game's own website
 
03:08:37.030 --> 03:08:37.040 align:start position:0%
states that their mission is to conserve
 
03:08:39.389 --> 03:08:39.399 align:start position:0%
manage and protect these resources and
 
03:08:39.399 --> 03:08:40.710 align:start position:0%
manage and protect these resources and
their

03:08:40.710 --> 03:08:40.720 align:start position:0%
their
 
03:08:43.030 --> 03:08:43.040 align:start position:0%
habitats there's already at least one
 
03:08:45.510 --> 03:08:45.520 align:start position:0%
one state wildlife agency in the US that
 
03:08:49.150 --> 03:08:49.160 align:start position:0%
is doing this and what this bill will do
 
03:08:50.990 --> 03:08:51.000 align:start position:0%
and that is the Colorado Parks and
 
03:08:53.710 --> 03:08:53.720 align:start position:0%
Wildlife Commission it's a citizen board

03:09:20.550 --> 03:09:20.560 align:start position:0%
balance these votes and provide a
 
03:09:22.469 --> 03:09:22.479 align:start position:0%

commission to represent the kinds of
 
03:11:15.309 --> 03:11:15.319 align:start position:0%

today I'm speaking before you to express
 
03:12:32.349 --> 03:12:32.359 align:start position:0%
my opposition to House Bill 118 as
 
03:12:34.550 --> 03:12:34.560 align:start position:0%
originally drafted out of respect for
 
03:12:36.349 --> 03:12:36.359 align:start position:0%
your time I will keep my testimony short
 
03:12:37.469 --> 03:12:37.479 align:start position:0%
though I encourage you to read the
 
03:12:40.110 --> 03:12:40.120 align:start position:0%
written testimony I have submitted the
 
03:12:41.750 --> 03:12:41.760 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire fishing Game Commission
 
03:12:43.710 --> 03:12:43.720 align:start position:0%
has continuously upheld its honorable
 
03:12:45.710 --> 03:12:45.720 align:start position:0%
duties as the stewards of New
 
03:12:47.349 --> 03:12:47.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's wildlife and Marine
 
03:12:49.870 --> 03:12:49.880 align:start position:0%
Resources and I therefore don't see the
 
03:12:51.950 --> 03:12:51.960 align:start position:0%
need to reform the qualifications needed
 
03:12:54.429 --> 03:12:54.439 align:start position:0%
for the commission's membership uh the
 
03:12:56.510 --> 03:12:56.520 align:start position:0%
commission is comprised of those who
 
03:12:58.070 --> 03:12:58.080 align:start position:0%
have years of on the ground experience
 
03:13:00.590 --> 03:13:00.600 align:start position:0%
in Hunting Fishing and trapping uh it's
 
03:13:03.030 --> 03:13:03.040 align:start position:0%
my concern that lessening the number of
 
03:13:04.229 --> 03:13:04.239 align:start position:0%
years in which the prospective
 
03:13:06.590 --> 03:13:06.600 align:start position:0%
commission must hold such a license
 
03:13:08.990 --> 03:13:09.000 align:start position:0%
opens up the real possibility uh that an
 
03:13:11.030 --> 03:13:11.040 align:start position:0%
individual who opposes consumptive use
 
03:13:13.870 --> 03:13:13.880 align:start position:0%
practices may be I to serve on the
 
03:13:16.469 --> 03:13:16.479 align:start position:0%
commission uh just to wrap up I'd like
 
03:13:18.150 --> 03:13:18.160 align:start position:0%

03:13:21.190 --> 03:13:21.200 align:start position:0%

about our Region's green spaces and how
 
03:14:24.830 --> 03:14:24.840 align:start position:0%

scope of the Fish and Game Commission to
 
03:14:38.590 --> 03:14:38.600 align:start position:0%
include aspects that the fishing game
 
03:14:41.229 --> 03:14:41.239 align:start position:0%
department already deals with in order
 
03:14:44.469 --> 03:14:44.479 align:start position:0%

willing to expand the commission to
 
03:15:30.750 --> 03:15:30.760 align:start position:0%
include some people on it uh I know
 
03:15:33.189 --> 03:15:33.199 align:start position:0%
there are people good people in the
 
03:15:35.550 --> 03:15:35.560 align:start position:0%
department working on these things but
 
03:15:39.110 --> 03:15:39.120 align:start position:0%
uh quite frequently the commission uh
 
03:15:42.110 --> 03:15:42.120 align:start position:0%
has not had enough expertise within it
 
03:15:46.630 --> 03:15:46.640 align:start position:0%
to to listen to that side during their
 
03:15:48.510 --> 03:15:48.520 align:start position:0%
deliberations and I think that it would
 
03:15:50.830 --> 03:15:50.840 align:start position:0%
be a great help to the commission and
 
03:15:53.269 --> 03:15:53.279 align:start position:0%

public trust for all of New Hampshire
 
03:16:43.550 --> 03:16:43.560 align:start position:0%
not just for consump of users as was
 
03:16:46.429 --> 03:16:46.439 align:start position:0%
implied by a testimony of an earlier
 
03:16:49.150 --> 03:16:49.160 align:start position:0%
gentleman The Fish and Game Commission
 
03:16:51.189 --> 03:16:51.199 align:start position:0%

among other things maintaining a healthy
 
03:16:55.349 --> 03:16:55.359 align:start position:0%

Wildlife and Marine
 
03:17:00.070 --> 03:17:00.080 align:start position:0%
Resources however only approximately 10%
 
03:17:02.189 --> 03:17:02.199 align:start position:0%
of the uh New Hampshire's residents
 
03:17:04.550 --> 03:17:04.560 align:start position:0%
which are the license holders can serve
 
03:17:06.469 --> 03:17:06.479 align:start position:0%
on the commission and have a significant
 
03:17:09.870 --> 03:17:09.880 align:start position:0%
say in decisions affecting the wildlife
 
03:17:12.590 --> 03:17:12.600 align:start position:0%
the other 90% of the New Hampshire res
 
03:17:17.030 --> 03:17:17.040 align:start position:0%
presidents if we follow if we approve
 
03:17:19.590 --> 03:17:19.600 align:start position:0%
the bill or the amendment to the bill
 
03:17:22.510 --> 03:17:22.520 align:start position:0%
sponsored by Spain reeden Howard would
 
03:17:25.349 --> 03:17:25.359 align:start position:0%
allow a greater diversity of people to
 
03:17:26.990 --> 03:17:27.000 align:start position:0%
actually participate in the governance
 
03:17:30.110 --> 03:17:30.120 align:start position:0%
of their public trust resources now
 
03:17:33.790 --> 03:17:33.800 align:start position:0%
consider that uh the inequity of what we
 
03:17:35.710 --> 03:17:35.720 align:start position:0%
have now with the commission of the 11
 
03:17:38.070 --> 03:17:38.080 align:start position:0%
member commission three members are
 
03:17:40.189 --> 03:17:40.199 align:start position:0%
members of the trapping New Hampshire
 
03:17:43.910 --> 03:17:43.920 align:start position:0%
trapping Association so 11 members
 
03:17:47.309 --> 03:17:47.319 align:start position:0%
27% of them are uh active and
 
03:17:49.630 --> 03:17:49.640 align:start position:0%
enthusiastic Trappers and yet they only
 
03:17:49.640 --> 03:17:52.349 align:start position:0%
enthusiastic Trappers and yet they only
represent

03:17:52.349 --> 03:17:52.359 align:start position:0%
represent
 
03:17:54.750 --> 03:17:54.760 align:start position:0%
0.04% of New Hampshire's
 
03:17:58.990 --> 03:17:59.000 align:start position:0%
population all this amendment ask for is
 
03:18:03.150 --> 03:18:03.160 align:start position:0%
another minority position on the
 
03:18:07.469 --> 03:18:07.479 align:start position:0%
commission um so who else is interested
 
03:18:10.269 --> 03:18:10.279 align:start position:0%
well uh these are not the anti-hunters
 
03:18:13.309 --> 03:18:13.319 align:start position:0%
the new New Hampshire Wildlife
 
03:18:16.550 --> 03:18:16.560 align:start position:0%

03:18:18.750 --> 03:18:18.760 align:start position:0%
fear-mongering notice to oppose this
 
03:18:20.990 --> 03:18:21.000 align:start position:0%
bill the New Hampshire Wildlife
 
03:18:23.710 --> 03:18:23.720 align:start position:0%
Federation represents less less than 4%
 
03:18:25.870 --> 03:18:25.880 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire's population the people
 
03:18:28.590 --> 03:18:28.600 align:start position:0%
that really want an input into this
 
03:18:30.269 --> 03:18:30.279 align:start position:0%
governance are
 
03:18:33.070 --> 03:18:33.080 align:start position:0%
conservationists and folks who recreate
 
03:18:35.110 --> 03:18:35.120 align:start position:0%

03:18:36.640 --> 03:18:37.750 align:start position:0%

Hampshire's

03:18:37.750 --> 03:18:37.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's
 
03:18:41.110 --> 03:18:41.120 align:start position:0%
ecosystem over harvesting
 
03:18:43.269 --> 03:18:43.279 align:start position:0%
wildlife and there are also those like
 
03:18:45.110 --> 03:18:45.120 align:start position:0%
myself that believe that the commission
 
03:18:46.670 --> 03:18:46.680 align:start position:0%
needs a more Val that some of the
 
03:18:48.670 --> 03:18:48.680 align:start position:0%
decisions by the commission need a more
 
03:18:51.630 --> 03:18:51.640 align:start position:0%
valid scientific sound Foundation now I
 
03:18:53.670 --> 03:18:53.680 align:start position:0%
know that we have great scientists with
 
03:18:55.790 --> 03:18:55.800 align:start position:0%
the fish and C department but as a
 
03:18:57.790 --> 03:18:57.800 align:start position:0%
gentleman observed
 
03:19:00.070 --> 03:19:00.080 align:start position:0%
earlier at times the commission has
 
03:19:03.510 --> 03:19:03.520 align:start position:0%
overruled their scientific advice so the
 
03:19:05.750 --> 03:19:05.760 align:start position:0%
bill the amendment to the bill would
 
03:19:09.910 --> 03:19:09.920 align:start position:0%
Invision putting up to four
 
03:19:12.630 --> 03:19:12.640 align:start position:0%
scientists on the uh on the commission
 
03:19:14.389 --> 03:19:14.399 align:start position:0%
three from counties and possibly one
 
03:19:16.189 --> 03:19:16.199 align:start position:0%
from the Sea Coast as I understand that
 
03:19:18.550 --> 03:19:18.560 align:start position:0%
I see representative Spain shaking his
 
03:19:21.910 --> 03:19:21.920 align:start position:0%
head but so um making room on the
 
03:19:23.469 --> 03:19:23.479 align:start position:0%
commission for New Hampshire citizens
 
03:19:25.510 --> 03:19:25.520 align:start position:0%
who value Wildlife for purposes other
 
03:19:28.269 --> 03:19:28.279 align:start position:0%
than harvesting is an equitable way of
 
03:19:30.590 --> 03:19:30.600 align:start position:0%
modifying the regulations to be
 
03:19:33.750 --> 03:19:33.760 align:start position:0%
consistent with the real world it
 
03:19:36.550 --> 03:19:36.560 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean the end of hunting it me
 
03:19:38.510 --> 03:19:38.520 align:start position:0%
means that it might be more balanced
 
03:19:41.110 --> 03:19:41.120 align:start position:0%
foundation for wildlife governance
 
03:19:41.120 --> 03:19:42.630 align:start position:0%
foundation for wildlife governance
decisions

03:19:42.630 --> 03:19:42.640 align:start position:0%

03:19:42.640 --> 03:19:44.389 align:start position:0%
decisions
thank

this bill at the current time next up is
 
03:20:02.150 --> 03:20:02.160 align:start position:0%
uh Dr vapo again um from the New
 
03:20:04.510 --> 03:20:04.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire wildlife Coalition Dr vapo if
 
03:20:05.910 --> 03:20:05.920 align:start position:0%
you remember to unmute yourself once
 
03:20:08.630 --> 03:20:08.640 align:start position:0%
you're joined in thank you very much Mr
 
03:20:10.950 --> 03:20:10.960 align:start position:0%
chair and members of the
 
03:20:14.750 --> 03:20:14.760 align:start position:0%
committee um I have submitted written
 
03:20:17.150 --> 03:20:17.160 align:start position:0%
testimony and I encourage you to read
 
03:20:20.070 --> 03:20:20.080 align:start position:0%
that of course this the four points that
 
03:20:23.990 --> 03:20:24.000 align:start position:0%
I wanted to make simply is that we do
 
03:20:27.389 --> 03:20:27.399 align:start position:0%
have a problem relative to the New
 
03:20:29.870 --> 03:20:29.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Fish and Game
 
03:20:32.189 --> 03:20:32.199 align:start position:0%
Commission for the reasons that you've
 
03:20:34.670 --> 03:20:34.680 align:start position:0%
just heard it is not entirely
 
03:20:37.349 --> 03:20:37.359 align:start position:0%
representative of the population of the
 
03:20:40.110 --> 03:20:40.120 align:start position:0%
state now I understand that having
 
03:20:42.269 --> 03:20:42.279 align:start position:0%
served on the study Commission under
 
03:20:45.710 --> 03:20:45.720 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 48 two years ago that the
 
03:20:47.910 --> 03:20:47.920 align:start position:0%
sentiments expressed at that time was
 
03:20:50.710 --> 03:20:50.720 align:start position:0%
that our commissioners are fine who they
 
03:20:52.510 --> 03:20:52.520 align:start position:0%
are and what they
 
03:20:54.710 --> 03:20:54.720 align:start position:0%
represent but I would encourage you to
 
03:20:57.030 --> 03:20:57.040 align:start position:0%
look at the breadth of what the
 
03:21:00.070 --> 03:21:00.080 align:start position:0%
department requires its employees to
 
03:21:02.670 --> 03:21:02.680 align:start position:0%
cover management of
 
03:21:07.710 --> 03:21:07.720 align:start position:0%
76,7 51 Acres protection of over 4,000
 
03:21:09.389 --> 03:21:09.399 align:start position:0%
species of
 
03:21:12.469 --> 03:21:12.479 align:start position:0%
wildlife enforcement of all the laws and
 
03:21:14.110 --> 03:21:14.120 align:start position:0%
rules governing
 
03:21:17.229 --> 03:21:17.239 align:start position:0%
ohvs hosting a wide range of educational
 
03:21:18.950 --> 03:21:18.960 align:start position:0%
programs and training
 
03:21:21.550 --> 03:21:21.560 align:start position:0%
workshops oversight of the marine and
 
03:21:23.950 --> 03:21:23.960 align:start position:0%
Inland Fisheries and of course search
 
03:21:27.910 --> 03:21:27.920 align:start position:0%
and rescue and I challenge the committee
 
03:21:31.870 --> 03:21:31.880 align:start position:0%
to state that our commissioners can
 
03:21:34.070 --> 03:21:34.080 align:start position:0%
adequately handle all of those
 
03:21:36.510 --> 03:21:36.520 align:start position:0%
responsibilities in an equitable and
 
03:21:39.670 --> 03:21:39.680 align:start position:0%
just way based on their
 
03:21:42.189 --> 03:21:42.199 align:start position:0%
experience as a PhD science scientist
 
03:21:46.550 --> 03:21:46.560 align:start position:0%
and wildlife biologist I too do not hold
 
03:21:49.349 --> 03:21:49.359 align:start position:0%
a current hunting and fishing license
 
03:21:52.429 --> 03:21:52.439 align:start position:0%
and yet am not represented in that
 
03:21:54.070 --> 03:21:54.080 align:start position:0%
respect on the
 
03:21:56.790 --> 03:21:56.800 align:start position:0%
commission I too have
 
03:21:59.469 --> 03:21:59.479 align:start position:0%
observed having just looked at the fur
 
03:22:01.910 --> 03:22:01.920 align:start position:0%
bear proposal for example for
 
03:22:04.870 --> 03:22:04.880 align:start position:0%
2021 that there are no proposed changes
 
03:22:07.710 --> 03:22:07.720 align:start position:0%
for fisher trapping and yet for the past
 
03:22:11.189 --> 03:22:11.199 align:start position:0%
25 years the cpue has gone down from
 
03:22:12.309 --> 03:22:12.319 align:start position:0%
over three
 
03:22:13.710 --> 03:22:13.720 align:start position:0%
to just about
 
03:22:16.670 --> 03:22:16.680 align:start position:0%
one that is a decline of a species that
 
03:22:18.950 --> 03:22:18.960 align:start position:0%
the staff themselves have
 
03:22:21.150 --> 03:22:21.160 align:start position:0%
recommended a
 
03:22:23.910 --> 03:22:23.920 align:start position:0%
moratorium relative to trapping
 
03:22:26.910 --> 03:22:26.920 align:start position:0%
Fisher the commission will probably
 
03:22:30.790 --> 03:22:30.800 align:start position:0%
under its current composition uphold
 
03:22:35.150 --> 03:22:35.160 align:start position:0%
that current proposal and yet the staff
 
03:22:37.229 --> 03:22:37.239 align:start position:0%
not only in this instance but in others
 
03:22:39.070 --> 03:22:39.080 align:start position:0%
such as was mentioned with the coyote
 
03:22:42.389 --> 03:22:42.399 align:start position:0%
pop rearing time period uh has
 
03:22:42.399 --> 03:22:44.030 align:start position:0%
pop rearing time period uh has
consistently

03:22:44.030 --> 03:22:44.040 align:start position:0%
consistently
 
03:22:47.710 --> 03:22:47.720 align:start position:0%
been rejected at least their proposals
 
03:22:48.870 --> 03:22:48.880 align:start position:0%
by the
 
03:22:51.309 --> 03:22:51.319 align:start position:0%
commission I'm as interested in anybody
 
03:22:53.110 --> 03:22:53.120 align:start position:0%
in maintaining the population of
 
03:22:55.429 --> 03:22:55.439 align:start position:0%
Wildlife and maintaining the tradition
 
03:22:57.389 --> 03:22:57.399 align:start position:0%
of hunting and fishing which I grew up
 
03:22:59.389 --> 03:22:59.399 align:start position:0%
doing for 25
 
03:23:02.710 --> 03:23:02.720 align:start position:0%
years that said I don't feel represented
 
03:23:06.150 --> 03:23:06.160 align:start position:0%
and I believe through the help of
 
03:23:08.670 --> 03:23:08.680 align:start position:0%
Representatives Blain Reed and Howard
 
03:23:11.309 --> 03:23:11.319 align:start position:0%
with the amendment as currently proposed
 
03:23:15.389 --> 03:23:15.399 align:start position:0%
we could help amarate that issue so
 
03:23:18.349 --> 03:23:18.359 align:start position:0%
again I thank you for your time and I
 
03:23:21.469 --> 03:23:21.479 align:start position:0%
hope that we can continue to engage in a
 
03:23:23.990 --> 03:23:24.000 align:start position:0%
dialogue that will result in some
 
03:23:26.550 --> 03:23:26.560 align:start position:0%
positive results thank
 
03:23:28.950 --> 03:23:28.960 align:start position:0%

attract and retain more young people
 
03:24:04.830 --> 03:24:04.840 align:start position:0%
here in the granite state and I'm here
 
03:24:06.750 --> 03:24:06.760 align:start position:0%
today to speak very briefly in support
 
03:24:10.229 --> 03:24:10.239 align:start position:0%
of the intent of House Bill 118 so
 
03:24:11.389 --> 03:24:11.399 align:start position:0%
attracting and retaining more young
 
03:24:13.349 --> 03:24:13.359 align:start position:0%
people people is critical to the future
 
03:24:14.790 --> 03:24:14.800 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire right now we're the
 
03:24:16.510 --> 03:24:16.520 align:start position:0%
second oldest state in the country with
 
03:24:17.870 --> 03:24:17.880 align:start position:0%
one of the lowest unemployment rates
 
03:24:20.349 --> 03:24:20.359 align:start position:0%
even during the time of Co and on top of
 
03:24:21.950 --> 03:24:21.960 align:start position:0%
this we're the number one exporter of
 
03:24:23.229 --> 03:24:23.239 align:start position:0%
high school graduates seeking a
 
03:24:25.950 --> 03:24:25.960 align:start position:0%
four-year degree with about 62% of these
 
03:24:27.229 --> 03:24:27.239 align:start position:0%
young people leaving the state every
 
03:24:29.469 --> 03:24:29.479 align:start position:0%
year some of them come back eventually
 
03:24:32.229 --> 03:24:32.239 align:start position:0%
but a lot of them don't so in short New
 
03:24:33.790 --> 03:24:33.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire needs all the people we can
 
03:24:35.630 --> 03:24:35.640 align:start position:0%
get in general and all the young people
 
03:24:37.830 --> 03:24:37.840 align:start position:0%
we can get in particular our businesses
 
03:24:39.790 --> 03:24:39.800 align:start position:0%
need workers and customers our towns
 
03:24:41.630 --> 03:24:41.640 align:start position:0%
need volunteer board members and our
 
03:24:43.910 --> 03:24:43.920 align:start position:0%
nonprofits churches and Civic clubs you
 
03:24:45.590 --> 03:24:45.600 align:start position:0%
all need volunteers to accomplish their
 
03:24:47.630 --> 03:24:47.640 align:start position:0%
vital missions without which our
 
03:24:50.630 --> 03:24:50.640 align:start position:0%
communities just can't function so about
 
03:24:52.469 --> 03:24:52.479 align:start position:0%
three years ago stor play commissioned a
 
03:24:54.389 --> 03:24:54.399 align:start position:0%
survey to collect data on why young
 
03:24:55.910 --> 03:24:55.920 align:start position:0%
people stay in New Hampshire and why
 
03:24:58.070 --> 03:24:58.080 align:start position:0%
they might leave the state and the
 
03:25:00.150 --> 03:25:00.160 align:start position:0%
number one reason uh that we found that
 
03:25:02.469 --> 03:25:02.479 align:start position:0%
young people stay here is to access our
 
03:25:04.269 --> 03:25:04.279 align:start position:0%
state's unparalleled outdoor
 
03:25:06.349 --> 03:25:06.359 align:start position:0%
recreational opportunities and we heard
 
03:25:08.309 --> 03:25:08.319 align:start position:0%
that again uh a little more than a year
 
03:25:10.630 --> 03:25:10.640 align:start position:0%
ago last winter uh as we went around the
 
03:25:12.750 --> 03:25:12.760 align:start position:0%
state to nine Loc ations all around New
 
03:25:15.030 --> 03:25:15.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire as part of our policy and pint
 
03:25:17.790 --> 03:25:17.800 align:start position:0%
series again people said you know having
 
03:25:19.150 --> 03:25:19.160 align:start position:0%
and being close to these outdoor
 
03:25:21.750 --> 03:25:21.760 align:start position:0%
recreational amenities was uh so great
 
03:25:23.750 --> 03:25:23.760 align:start position:0%
about uh about New Hampshire and what
 
03:25:27.229 --> 03:25:27.239 align:start position:0%
keeps them here so you know to maintain
 
03:25:29.349 --> 03:25:29.359 align:start position:0%
and kind of enhance these unparalleled
 
03:25:30.950 --> 03:25:30.960 align:start position:0%
outdoor recreational opportunities our
 
03:25:33.429 --> 03:25:33.439 align:start position:0%
our Golden Goose if you will uh State
 
03:25:35.030 --> 03:25:35.040 align:start position:0%
workk play does support the aim of House
 
03:25:37.389 --> 03:25:37.399 align:start position:0%
Bill 18 which as we've heard seeks to
 
03:25:39.550 --> 03:25:39.560 align:start position:0%
expand who can be nominated and serve on
 
03:25:42.110 --> 03:25:42.120 align:start position:0%
the fishing Game Commission um we kind
 
03:25:44.030 --> 03:25:44.040 align:start position:0%
of the way we see it is that allowing
 
03:25:45.910 --> 03:25:45.920 align:start position:0%
more people to be nominated to and serve
 
03:25:47.630 --> 03:25:47.640 align:start position:0%
on the fishing Game Commission will
 
03:25:49.070 --> 03:25:49.080 align:start position:0%
increase the viewpoints and the
 
03:25:51.550 --> 03:25:51.560 align:start position:0%
perspectives represented on that body
 
03:25:53.269 --> 03:25:53.279 align:start position:0%
and that in turn will benefit how the
 
03:25:55.189 --> 03:25:55.199 align:start position:0%
lands and resources that the commission
 
03:25:58.030 --> 03:25:58.040 align:start position:0%
manages uh or overseas are managed and
 
03:25:59.269 --> 03:25:59.279 align:start position:0%
will be done in a way that is more
 
03:26:00.950 --> 03:26:00.960 align:start position:0%
reflective of how young people in
 
03:26:03.110 --> 03:26:03.120 align:start position:0%
particular want to enjoy the state's
 
03:26:05.710 --> 03:26:05.720 align:start position:0%
natural resources and outdoor amenities
 
03:26:08.229 --> 03:26:08.239 align:start position:0%

support the proposed legislation as
 
03:26:47.429 --> 03:26:47.439 align:start position:0%

the bill
 
03:26:51.870 --> 03:26:51.880 align:start position:0%
sponsor when the edited version was
 
03:26:53.469 --> 03:26:53.479 align:start position:0%
available in print we took issue with a
 
03:26:56.950 --> 03:26:56.960 align:start position:0%
few words and a few of the paragraphs so
 
03:27:01.030 --> 03:27:01.040 align:start position:0%
we would like to take your attention to
 
03:27:04.590 --> 03:27:04.600 align:start position:0%
page one paragraph three sections A and
 
03:27:06.950 --> 03:27:06.960 align:start position:0%
B we thought we discussed this pretty
 
03:27:08.870 --> 03:27:08.880 align:start position:0%
well and we feel like it was a misprint
 
03:27:11.990 --> 03:27:12.000 align:start position:0%
or it just didn't get um carried over
 
03:27:14.710 --> 03:27:14.720 align:start position:0%
well but we want to strike the word and
 
03:27:14.720 --> 03:27:16.030 align:start position:0%
well but we want to strike the word and
between

03:27:16.030 --> 03:27:16.040 align:start position:0%
between
 
03:27:18.870 --> 03:27:18.880 align:start position:0%
wildlife and the word habitat
 
03:27:21.510 --> 03:27:21.520 align:start position:0%

Hunter Bird Hunter and fisherman
 
03:28:45.110 --> 03:28:45.120 align:start position:0%
I oppose House Bill 118 because I
 
03:28:47.630 --> 03:28:47.640 align:start position:0%
actually do think it's a trojan horse as
 
03:28:50.710 --> 03:28:50.720 align:start position:0%
written I have not seen the
 
03:28:54.429 --> 03:28:54.439 align:start position:0%
amendment but um basically by opening
 
03:28:57.590 --> 03:28:57.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:03.229 --> 03:29:03.239 align:start position:0%
501c3 uh you can have people nominated
 
03:29:05.550 --> 03:29:05.560 align:start position:0%
that belong to organizations like the
 
03:29:08.349 --> 03:29:08.359 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Animal Welfare
 
03:29:12.630 --> 03:29:12.640 align:start position:0%
League um I understand the concern that
 
03:29:12.640 --> 03:29:13.710 align:start position:0%
League um I understand the concern that
more

03:29:13.710 --> 03:29:13.720 align:start position:0%
more
 
03:29:16.189 --> 03:29:16.199 align:start position:0%
conservation organizations would like to
 
03:29:16.199 --> 03:29:17.550 align:start position:0%
conservation organizations would like to
be

03:29:17.550 --> 03:29:17.560 align:start position:0%
be
 
03:29:21.389 --> 03:29:21.399 align:start position:0%
represented however um I believe this is
 
03:29:23.389 --> 03:29:23.399 align:start position:0%
just a Toe Hold
 
03:29:26.189 --> 03:29:26.199 align:start position:0%
to dismantle
 
03:29:29.389 --> 03:29:29.399 align:start position:0%
Hunting Fishing and trapping hunting and
 
03:29:32.389 --> 03:29:32.399 align:start position:0%
trapping specifically in the
 
03:29:36.229 --> 03:29:36.239 align:start position:0%
State uh so I do oppose the spill I
 
03:29:38.750 --> 03:29:38.760 align:start position:0%
think some of the comments have been
 
03:29:41.910 --> 03:29:41.920 align:start position:0%
disingenuous um the sponsoring
 
03:29:45.750 --> 03:29:45.760 align:start position:0%
representative uh I can assure you after
 
03:29:50.990 --> 03:29:51.000 align:start position:0%
well I'm 57 and I've hunted for 48 of
 
03:29:51.000 --> 03:29:52.110 align:start position:0%
well I'm 57 and I've hunted for 48 of
those

03:29:52.110 --> 03:29:52.120 align:start position:0%
those
 
03:29:55.750 --> 03:29:55.760 align:start position:0%
years and I can assure you that I have
 
03:29:57.070 --> 03:29:57.080 align:start position:0%
just as much
 
03:30:01.630 --> 03:30:01.640 align:start position:0%
enthusiasm at 57 as I did as a
 
03:30:07.429 --> 03:30:07.439 align:start position:0%
child um so I think there's uh some
 
03:30:11.590 --> 03:30:11.600 align:start position:0%
disingenuous objectives with this bill
 
03:30:16.630 --> 03:30:16.640 align:start position:0%
and uh I hope it will get voted itl and
 
03:30:21.070 --> 03:30:21.080 align:start position:0%
I hope it will be on the table in the
 
03:30:22.910 --> 03:30:22.920 align:start position:0%
house and never make it to the
 
03:30:25.189 --> 03:30:25.199 align:start position:0%

the committee um again for your time my
 
03:30:56.710 --> 03:30:56.720 align:start position:0%
name is Gina scrofano I am a resident of
 
03:30:58.830 --> 03:30:58.840 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and I'm speaking in
 
03:31:01.670 --> 03:31:01.680 align:start position:0%
support of hb18 as
 
03:31:04.590 --> 03:31:04.600 align:start position:0%
introduced um as discussed today uh the
 
03:31:06.349 --> 03:31:06.359 align:start position:0%
fishing game has many issues on their
 
03:31:09.229 --> 03:31:09.239 align:start position:0%
plate to put it mildly um ranging from
 
03:31:11.030 --> 03:31:11.040 align:start position:0%
those involving hunting and fishing
 
03:31:14.389 --> 03:31:14.399 align:start position:0%
conservation to search and rescue um
 
03:31:16.590 --> 03:31:16.600 align:start position:0%
we've heard from many giving testimony
 
03:31:19.269 --> 03:31:19.279 align:start position:0%
um in terms of their belief that the
 
03:31:22.790 --> 03:31:22.800 align:start position:0%
Fish and Game Commission is um is not
 
03:31:24.830 --> 03:31:24.840 align:start position:0%
representative of the majority of the
 
03:31:27.870 --> 03:31:27.880 align:start position:0%
public as according to our state law
 
03:31:31.189 --> 03:31:31.199 align:start position:0%
they do have the authority um the duty
 
03:31:34.590 --> 03:31:34.600 align:start position:0%
um to do so um so I won't speak too much
 
03:31:36.150 --> 03:31:36.160 align:start position:0%
um on that I do agree with that
 
03:31:37.910 --> 03:31:37.920 align:start position:0%
standpoint I just want to highlight a
 
03:31:40.030 --> 03:31:40.040 align:start position:0%
few points of note that weren't included
 
03:31:42.070 --> 03:31:42.080 align:start position:0%
that may help you
 
03:31:45.469 --> 03:31:45.479 align:start position:0%
um I wanted to highlight that uh not
 
03:31:47.630 --> 03:31:47.640 align:start position:0%
only does funding for the fishing game
 
03:31:50.630 --> 03:31:50.640 align:start position:0%
come from General State funds via the
 
03:31:53.469 --> 03:31:53.479 align:start position:0%
taxation of all New Hampshire residents
 
03:31:55.830 --> 03:31:55.840 align:start position:0%
um but according to studies the majority
 
03:31:58.870 --> 03:31:58.880 align:start position:0%
of funding from Wildlife restoration
 
03:32:01.550 --> 03:32:01.560 align:start position:0%
programs and taxes from
 
03:32:04.710 --> 03:32:04.720 align:start position:0%
non-hunters um and non-fishers so for
 
03:32:06.830 --> 03:32:06.840 align:start position:0%
example in April
 
03:32:10.229 --> 03:32:10.239 align:start position:0%
2017 Glenn normano the former executive
 
03:32:12.750 --> 03:32:12.760 align:start position:0%
director of of the fishing game pointed
 
03:32:14.510 --> 03:32:14.520 align:start position:0%
out during the fishing Game Commission
 
03:32:16.710 --> 03:32:16.720 align:start position:0%
monthly meeting that more Pitman
 
03:32:19.429 --> 03:32:19.439 align:start position:0%
Robinson monies which provides federal
 
03:32:21.790 --> 03:32:21.800 align:start position:0%
aid um to the fishing game and which
 
03:32:23.750 --> 03:32:23.760 align:start position:0%
come from federal taxes on guns
 
03:32:26.670 --> 03:32:26.680 align:start position:0%
ammunition and archery equipment more of
 
03:32:29.110 --> 03:32:29.120 align:start position:0%
that funding is coming from firearm and
 
03:32:32.469 --> 03:32:32.479 align:start position:0%
ammunition sales um ammunition sales to
 
03:32:34.670 --> 03:32:34.680 align:start position:0%
non-hunters and hunters and that
 
03:32:36.910 --> 03:32:36.920 align:start position:0%
information was backed by multiple
 
03:32:39.670 --> 03:32:39.680 align:start position:0%
reports including the Firearms consumer
 
03:32:41.469 --> 03:32:41.479 align:start position:0%
segmentation report
 
03:32:43.710 --> 03:32:43.720 align:start position:0%
which includes a segmentation analysis
 
03:32:45.429 --> 03:32:45.439 align:start position:0%
conducted by the National Shooting
 
03:32:47.990 --> 03:32:48.000 align:start position:0%
Sports foundation and Southwick
 
03:32:50.630 --> 03:32:50.640 align:start position:0%
Associates um that is also true in terms
 
03:32:53.030 --> 03:32:53.040 align:start position:0%
of the Dingle Johnson act which provides
 
03:32:55.830 --> 03:32:55.840 align:start position:0%
federal aid via excise taxes on fishing
 
03:32:57.670 --> 03:32:57.680 align:start position:0%
equipment motorboats and boat
 
03:33:00.070 --> 03:33:00.080 align:start position:0%
fuel and that is logical when one
 
03:33:01.710 --> 03:33:01.720 align:start position:0%
considers the fact that not all gun
 
03:33:04.110 --> 03:33:04.120 align:start position:0%
owners are hunters and not all boat
 
03:33:06.469 --> 03:33:06.479 align:start position:0%
owners are Anglers so this all
 
03:33:08.229 --> 03:33:08.239 align:start position:0%
highlights the importance of equal and
 
03:33:10.070 --> 03:33:10.080 align:start position:0%
fair representation from the fishing
 
03:33:11.830 --> 03:33:11.840 align:start position:0%
game and it speaks to the importance of
 
03:33:14.389 --> 03:33:14.399 align:start position:0%
having more broad perspective and the
 
03:33:17.590 --> 03:33:17.600 align:start position:0%
expertise of those members um so that
 
03:33:19.389 --> 03:33:19.399 align:start position:0%
it's adequately representing all
 
03:33:22.590 --> 03:33:22.600 align:start position:0%
citizens and also to promote more
 
03:33:24.950 --> 03:33:24.960 align:start position:0%
involvement with the fishing game and
 
03:33:26.910 --> 03:33:26.920 align:start position:0%
potentially more donations to the
 
03:33:30.429 --> 03:33:30.439 align:start position:0%
fishing game from the public who would
 
03:33:32.830 --> 03:33:32.840 align:start position:0%
feel more inclined to do so if they felt
 
03:33:34.469 --> 03:33:34.479 align:start position:0%
that they could become involved that
 
03:33:36.590 --> 03:33:36.600 align:start position:0%
they were welcome and were also being
 
03:33:39.229 --> 03:33:39.239 align:start position:0%
represented um amending the nomination
 
03:33:41.229 --> 03:33:41.239 align:start position:0%
process by changing organiz ganizations
 
03:33:43.670 --> 03:33:43.680 align:start position:0%
that participate from splitting clubs to
 
03:33:43.680 --> 03:33:45.229 align:start position:0%
that participate from splitting clubs to
participating

03:33:45.229 --> 03:33:45.239 align:start position:0%
participating
 
03:33:47.710 --> 03:33:47.720 align:start position:0%
organization generally which has
 
03:33:50.070 --> 03:33:50.080 align:start position:0%
interests and specialized expertise in
 
03:33:51.349 --> 03:33:51.359 align:start position:0%
Wildlife or
 
03:33:53.990 --> 03:33:54.000 align:start position:0%
conservation um and also adds biology
 
03:33:55.790 --> 03:33:55.800 align:start position:0%
and ecology to the accepted
 
03:33:57.870 --> 03:33:57.880 align:start position:0%
qualifications of Commissioners which
 
03:33:59.950 --> 03:33:59.960 align:start position:0%
this bill does as introduced is a
 
03:34:02.710 --> 03:34:02.720 align:start position:0%
crucial step in addressing this issue
 
03:34:04.710 --> 03:34:04.720 align:start position:0%
and I just would briefly like to add
 
03:34:07.349 --> 03:34:07.359 align:start position:0%
that in general terms of creating sound
 
03:34:10.070 --> 03:34:10.080 align:start position:0%
rules and regulations having a broad
 
03:34:12.349 --> 03:34:12.359 align:start position:0%
range of perspectives and expertise as
 
03:34:14.630 --> 03:34:14.640 align:start position:0%
vital um just as when crafting and
 
03:34:17.030 --> 03:34:17.040 align:start position:0%
implementing legislation you know some
 
03:34:19.309 --> 03:34:19.319 align:start position:0%
may consider a difference of opinion or
 
03:34:22.189 --> 03:34:22.199 align:start position:0%
even opposition to a certain view um of
 
03:34:25.510 --> 03:34:25.520 align:start position:0%
a proposal as being harmful but I come
 
03:34:27.030 --> 03:34:27.040 align:start position:0%
from the standpoint that the more
 
03:34:29.269 --> 03:34:29.279 align:start position:0%
perspectives you bring to the table the
 
03:34:31.110 --> 03:34:31.120 align:start position:0%
more sound the final language and
 
03:34:33.309 --> 03:34:33.319 align:start position:0%
outcome will become just as with the
 
03:34:35.670 --> 03:34:35.680 align:start position:0%
wildlife cruelty Bill we discussed um
 
03:34:38.070 --> 03:34:38.080 align:start position:0%
earlier today that issue was originally
 
03:34:41.510 --> 03:34:41.520 align:start position:0%
introduced to the legislature in 2017
 
03:34:43.630 --> 03:34:43.640 align:start position:0%
although the opposition did make it
 
03:34:46.510 --> 03:34:46.520 align:start position:0%
challenging to implement um it put us on
 
03:34:48.349 --> 03:34:48.359 align:start position:0%
a path to creating a more collaborative
 
03:34:50.590 --> 03:34:50.600 align:start position:0%
and sound bill um that was introduced
 
03:34:52.309 --> 03:34:52.319 align:start position:0%
today and I think that really is a
 
03:34:55.189 --> 03:34:55.199 align:start position:0%
testament to having a broad range of
 
03:34:57.910 --> 03:34:57.920 align:start position:0%
perspectives particularly when something
 
03:35:00.910 --> 03:35:00.920 align:start position:0%
this this important um is concerned
 
03:35:02.590 --> 03:35:02.600 align:start position:0%
really does lead to a more sound
 
03:35:05.389 --> 03:35:05.399 align:start position:0%
approach um and final outcome so thank
 
03:35:08.070 --> 03:35:08.080 align:start position:0%

03:35:08.990 --> 03:35:09.000 align:start position:0%

Nature Conservancy here in New Hampshire

uh as representative Harvey stated in
 
03:35:40.990 --> 03:35:41.000 align:start position:0%
her testimony she did Reach Out out to
 
03:35:43.590 --> 03:35:43.600 align:start position:0%

03:35:50.349 --> 03:35:50.359 align:start position:0%
introduced Amendment uh we just have a
 
03:35:52.269 --> 03:35:52.279 align:start position:0%
few minor recommendations on the
 
03:35:54.990 --> 03:35:55.000 align:start position:0%
amendment language and I did submit WR

long morning so I just want to provide a
 
03:36:00.950 --> 03:36:00.960 align:start position:0%
brief overview of my written testimony
 
03:36:02.950 --> 03:36:02.960 align:start position:0%
but I hope you will all take some time
 
03:36:06.349 --> 03:36:06.359 align:start position:0%
to review that um so as many of you know
 
03:36:07.990 --> 03:36:08.000 align:start position:0%
the nature conservancy in New Hampshire
 
03:36:10.030 --> 03:36:10.040 align:start position:0%
does work closely with New Hampshire
 
03:36:11.990 --> 03:36:12.000 align:start position:0%
fishing game on everything from our
 
03:36:14.269 --> 03:36:14.279 align:start position:0%
landbased ecological and Wildlife
 
03:36:16.389 --> 03:36:16.399 align:start position:0%
Management to our science-based
 
03:36:18.910 --> 03:36:18.920 align:start position:0%
approaches uh to Habitat conservation
 
03:36:20.269 --> 03:36:20.279 align:start position:0%
which are actually reflected in the
 
03:36:23.189 --> 03:36:23.199 align:start position:0%
state's Wildlife action plan as well as
 
03:36:25.030 --> 03:36:25.040 align:start position:0%
our marine fisheries and oyster
 
03:36:26.750 --> 03:36:26.760 align:start position:0%
restoration activities that are very
 
03:36:29.070 --> 03:36:29.080 align:start position:0%
popular and uh throughout all of this
 
03:36:31.030 --> 03:36:31.040 align:start position:0%
work with fishing game we've always
 
03:36:32.510 --> 03:36:32.520 align:start position:0%
appreciated the expertise and
 
03:36:34.910 --> 03:36:34.920 align:start position:0%
professionalism of the staff and
 
03:36:37.630 --> 03:36:37.640 align:start position:0%
Leadership of the department so we are
 
03:36:39.590 --> 03:36:39.600 align:start position:0%
supporting the changes reflected in
 
03:36:41.110 --> 03:36:41.120 align:start position:0%
house bille 18
 
03:36:43.070 --> 03:36:43.080 align:start position:0%
uh for how a nomination to The Fish and
 
03:36:45.070 --> 03:36:45.080 align:start position:0%
Game Commission can be brought forward
 
03:36:47.750 --> 03:36:47.760 align:start position:0%
to the governor for consideration Uh
 
03:36:49.750 --> 03:36:49.760 align:start position:0%
current statute reserves the right to
 
03:36:51.910 --> 03:36:51.920 align:start position:0%
nominate individuals for consideration
 
03:36:54.349 --> 03:36:54.359 align:start position:0%
by the governor exclusively to sporting
 
03:36:56.950 --> 03:36:56.960 align:start position:0%
clubs in each County and while we
 
03:36:59.349 --> 03:36:59.359 align:start position:0%
believe that sporting clubs should have
 
03:37:01.269 --> 03:37:01.279 align:start position:0%
the ability to send nominations to the
 
03:37:03.550 --> 03:37:03.560 align:start position:0%
governor for consideration we also
 
03:37:05.429 --> 03:37:05.439 align:start position:0%
believe that they should not have
 
03:37:08.870 --> 03:37:08.880 align:start position:0%
exclusive statutory authority to do so
 
03:37:10.950 --> 03:37:10.960 align:start position:0%
the reason is New Hampshire's Wildlife
 
03:37:13.510 --> 03:37:13.520 align:start position:0%
is held in the public trust and the
 
03:37:15.550 --> 03:37:15.560 align:start position:0%
conservation of these public resources
 
03:37:17.910 --> 03:37:17.920 align:start position:0%
requires cooperation as the previous
 
03:37:20.510 --> 03:37:20.520 align:start position:0%
speaker noted decisionmaking from a
 
03:37:22.349 --> 03:37:22.359 align:start position:0%
diverse group of stakeholders and
 
03:37:23.630 --> 03:37:23.640 align:start position:0%
because of that we feel that the
 
03:37:25.469 --> 03:37:25.479 align:start position:0%
interests of these stakeholders should
 
03:37:27.710 --> 03:37:27.720 align:start position:0%
be able to be represented on the
 
03:37:30.110 --> 03:37:30.120 align:start position:0%
commission that governs the department
 
03:37:33.870 --> 03:37:33.880 align:start position:0%
so overall the changes reflected in hb18
 
03:37:37.510 --> 03:37:37.520 align:start position:0%
We Believe do represent a positive step
 
03:37:39.870 --> 03:37:39.880 align:start position:0%
uh in that direction and uh we
 
03:37:41.910 --> 03:37:41.920 align:start position:0%
appreciate the importance of uh
 
03:37:43.990 --> 03:37:44.000 align:start position:0%
licensing to the department both as a
 
03:37:46.870 --> 03:37:46.880 align:start position:0%
revenue source and um as the tradition
 
03:37:48.870 --> 03:37:48.880 align:start position:0%
and philosophy that hunting and fishing
 
03:37:51.030 --> 03:37:51.040 align:start position:0%
has in New Hampshire that said not
 
03:37:53.110 --> 03:37:53.120 align:start position:0%
everyone who values and believes in the
 
03:37:55.269 --> 03:37:55.279 align:start position:0%
mission of the department is an active
 
03:37:57.510 --> 03:37:57.520 align:start position:0%
Sports person holding a license as many
 
03:37:59.990 --> 03:38:00.000 align:start position:0%
of you know there are countless reasons
 
03:38:01.830 --> 03:38:01.840 align:start position:0%
why an individual who values the
 
03:38:03.469 --> 03:38:03.479 align:start position:0%
conservation of the state's Wildlife
 
03:38:05.670 --> 03:38:05.680 align:start position:0%
Resources may not have a hunting or
 
03:38:08.229 --> 03:38:08.239 align:start position:0%
fishing license and our current statute
 
03:38:10.469 --> 03:38:10.479 align:start position:0%
frankly makes it just more difficult for
 
03:38:11.870 --> 03:38:11.880 align:start position:0%
these individuals to serve on the
 
03:38:13.790 --> 03:38:13.800 align:start position:0%
commission even when their values
 
03:38:16.429 --> 03:38:16.439 align:start position:0%
clearly align with the department and um
 
03:38:17.950 --> 03:38:17.960 align:start position:0%
just lastly I'm not going to go through
 
03:38:20.269 --> 03:38:20.279 align:start position:0%
all of my remarks here but I did want to
 
03:38:21.950 --> 03:38:21.960 align:start position:0%
note that something as simple as
 
03:38:23.630 --> 03:38:23.640 align:start position:0%
lowering the license holding
 
03:38:26.189 --> 03:38:26.199 align:start position:0%
requirements from 5 to 10 years to four
 
03:38:28.070 --> 03:38:28.080 align:start position:0%
to seven years as listed in the
 
03:38:31.229 --> 03:38:31.239 align:start position:0%
amendment is a small step in enabling
 
03:38:33.910 --> 03:38:33.920 align:start position:0%
additional qualified individuals to be
 
03:38:36.710 --> 03:38:36.720 align:start position:0%
considered even um and as representative
 
03:38:38.550 --> 03:38:38.560 align:start position:0%
Harvey said this is a much more
 
03:38:40.950 --> 03:38:40.960 align:start position:0%
realistic timeline specifically for the
 
03:38:43.670 --> 03:38:43.680 align:start position:0%
millennial generation who we want to get
 
03:38:45.670 --> 03:38:45.680 align:start position:0%
more involved in hunting and fishing and
 
03:38:47.710 --> 03:38:47.720 align:start position:0%
our natural resources they're known for
 
03:38:50.229 --> 03:38:50.239 align:start position:0%
their transiency much more so than
 
03:38:52.030 --> 03:38:52.040 align:start position:0%
previous generations and so this small
 
03:38:53.349 --> 03:38:53.359 align:start position:0%
change to the license holding
 
03:38:55.870 --> 03:38:55.880 align:start position:0%
requirement provides enabling conditions
 
03:38:58.590 --> 03:38:58.600 align:start position:0%
for additional outdoor recreators to be
 
03:39:01.670 --> 03:39:01.680 align:start position:0%
able to be eligible to be nominated and
 
03:39:03.830 --> 03:39:03.840 align:start position:0%
right before I conclude here uh I think
 
03:39:05.830 --> 03:39:05.840 align:start position:0%
the most important piece of my testimony
 
03:39:09.790 --> 03:39:09.800 align:start position:0%
is I think um Mr dvo was his name he
 
03:39:14.510 --> 03:39:14.520 align:start position:0%
mentioned the change from um or to or I
 
03:39:17.990 --> 03:39:18.000 align:start position:0%
think it was from and to or um and this
 
03:39:22.750 --> 03:39:22.760 align:start position:0%
is listed in section three um part A and
 
03:39:25.950 --> 03:39:25.960 align:start position:0%
there's also um a listing of this within
 
03:39:29.710 --> 03:39:29.720 align:start position:0%
section three part B so we support the
 
03:39:33.830 --> 03:39:33.840 align:start position:0%
amendment if uh that and between fishing
 
03:39:36.469 --> 03:39:36.479 align:start position:0%
and trapping is changed back to or and
 
03:39:37.830 --> 03:39:37.840 align:start position:0%
with that I'm happy to answer any
 
03:39:40.750 --> 03:39:40.760 align:start position:0%
questions the committee may have thank
 
03:39:44.710 --> 03:39:44.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:46.750 --> 03:39:46.760 align:start position:0%
Vargas seeing none in the room or none

Nissa
 
03:39:53.469 --> 03:39:53.479 align:start position:0%
marks if you could unmute yourself that
 
03:39:56.150 --> 03:39:56.160 align:start position:0%
would be great go ahead great good
 
03:39:57.670 --> 03:39:57.680 align:start position:0%
afternoon Mr chair and members of the
 
03:39:59.349 --> 03:39:59.359 align:start position:0%
committee thank you for hearing my
 
03:40:01.830 --> 03:40:01.840 align:start position:0%
testimony in favor of
 
03:40:06.389 --> 03:40:06.399 align:start position:0%
hb18 I'm Nissa Mars in hener um so
 
03:40:08.870 --> 03:40:08.880 align:start position:0%
growing up hunting and trapping were the
 
03:40:11.150 --> 03:40:11.160 align:start position:0%
only ways that my was able to have meat
 
03:40:13.670 --> 03:40:13.680 align:start position:0%
on the table um and to this day our
 
03:40:15.590 --> 03:40:15.600 align:start position:0%
freezer is still full of venison from
 
03:40:17.469 --> 03:40:17.479 align:start position:0%
family uh and my partner and I have
 
03:40:20.229 --> 03:40:20.239 align:start position:0%
allowed hunting on our land in hener um
 
03:40:21.910 --> 03:40:21.920 align:start position:0%
so I certainly appreciate the many
 
03:40:23.950 --> 03:40:23.960 align:start position:0%
things that hunters and fishermen do for
 
03:40:26.150 --> 03:40:26.160 align:start position:0%
conservation and the relationship
 
03:40:29.830 --> 03:40:29.840 align:start position:0%
between hunters in the land um I also
 
03:40:32.070 --> 03:40:32.080 align:start position:0%
know that I'm the only one of my friends
 
03:40:33.910 --> 03:40:33.920 align:start position:0%
under the or sorry I also know that only
 
03:40:36.269 --> 03:40:36.279 align:start position:0%
one of my friends under the age of 40 in
 
03:40:39.349 --> 03:40:39.359 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire hunts are fishes um and
 
03:40:40.990 --> 03:40:41.000 align:start position:0%
yet my non- hunt hunting friends are
 
03:40:43.550 --> 03:40:43.560 align:start position:0%
still Avid Outdoors people who enjoy
 
03:40:45.990 --> 03:40:46.000 align:start position:0%
tracking non-game Wildlife or seeking
 
03:40:49.229 --> 03:40:49.239 align:start position:0%
out rare birds um and my friends aren't
 
03:40:52.670 --> 03:40:52.680 align:start position:0%
anomalies here um data show a stark
 
03:40:54.550 --> 03:40:54.560 align:start position:0%
generational shift in how people are
 
03:40:57.309 --> 03:40:57.319 align:start position:0%
using the outdoors um anecdotally we
 
03:40:58.710 --> 03:40:58.720 align:start position:0%
hear from bait shops in the North
 
03:41:01.229 --> 03:41:01.239 align:start position:0%
country that young people are coming in
 
03:41:02.790 --> 03:41:02.800 align:start position:0%
looking to catch and release native
 
03:41:05.309 --> 03:41:05.319 align:start position:0%
species rather than seeking stocked fish
 
03:41:06.910 --> 03:41:06.920 align:start position:0%
uh or the largest species or the best
 
03:41:10.189 --> 03:41:10.199 align:start position:0%
species for the fry pan um and in it in
 
03:41:12.030 --> 03:41:12.040 align:start position:0%
the meantime um the number of hunters is
 
03:41:14.229 --> 03:41:14.239 align:start position:0%
declining at a rate of about 1% a year
 
03:41:17.110 --> 03:41:17.120 align:start position:0%
or more um in New England as a whole we
 
03:41:19.630 --> 03:41:19.640 align:start position:0%
see only 2% of the population holds a
 
03:41:23.110 --> 03:41:23.120 align:start position:0%
hunting license where 36% report
 
03:41:25.590 --> 03:41:25.600 align:start position:0%
watching wildlife and 12% of people
 
03:41:27.750 --> 03:41:27.760 align:start position:0%
report traveling within the region to do
 
03:41:30.149 --> 03:41:30.159 align:start position:0%
so so it's not that people are staying
 
03:41:32.910 --> 03:41:32.920 align:start position:0%
inside they're just using the outdoors
 
03:41:35.790 --> 03:41:35.800 align:start position:0%
differently um we know that other
 
03:41:37.830 --> 03:41:37.840 align:start position:0%
demographic patterns are changing too
 
03:41:39.229 --> 03:41:39.239 align:start position:0%
and here I want to amplify what you
 
03:41:42.309 --> 03:41:42.319 align:start position:0%
heard in state workpl testimony um
 
03:41:44.630 --> 03:41:44.640 align:start position:0%
younger people are more likely to change
 
03:41:46.389 --> 03:41:46.399 align:start position:0%
jobs and more likely to move more
 
03:41:49.149 --> 03:41:49.159 align:start position:0%
frequently um and just as an example I
 
03:41:51.590 --> 03:41:51.600 align:start position:0%
have lived in eight states in the last
 
03:41:53.990 --> 03:41:54.000 align:start position:0%
15 years before finally settling in New
 
03:41:56.309 --> 03:41:56.319 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh and most of those moves
 
03:41:59.710 --> 03:41:59.720 align:start position:0%
were to follow jobs um the way that this
 
03:42:02.070 --> 03:42:02.080 align:start position:0%
bill reduces the time frame required for
 
03:42:04.309 --> 03:42:04.319 align:start position:0%
holding a hunting or fishing license and
 
03:42:06.590 --> 03:42:06.600 align:start position:0%
expands the eligibility requirements to
 
03:42:08.149 --> 03:42:08.159 align:start position:0%
include the option of membership in a
 
03:42:10.870 --> 03:42:10.880 align:start position:0%
conservation organization are both steps
 
03:42:12.710 --> 03:42:12.720 align:start position:0%
in the right direction to ensure that
 
03:42:14.349 --> 03:42:14.359 align:start position:0%
decisions made by Fish and Game
 
03:42:16.469 --> 03:42:16.479 align:start position:0%
Commission align with changing
 
03:42:18.670 --> 03:42:18.680 align:start position:0%
demographics in our state and changing
 
03:42:21.189 --> 03:42:21.199 align:start position:0%
public interests um I'm a young
 
03:42:22.990 --> 03:42:23.000 align:start position:0%
professional who lives here in large
 
03:42:24.990 --> 03:42:25.000 align:start position:0%
part because of our native wildlife and
 
03:42:27.389 --> 03:42:27.399 align:start position:0%
non-game Associated um outdoor
 
03:42:29.429 --> 03:42:29.439 align:start position:0%
recreation and would very much like to
 
03:42:31.429 --> 03:42:31.439 align:start position:0%
see a commission that really represents
 
03:42:33.469 --> 03:42:33.479 align:start position:0%
the interests of my peers in the
 
03:42:35.710 --> 03:42:35.720 align:start position:0%
outdoors um so for these reasons I
 
03:42:37.070 --> 03:42:37.080 align:start position:0%
strongly support this bill or
 
03:42:38.670 --> 03:42:38.680 align:start position:0%
representative Harvey's proposed
 
03:42:40.630 --> 03:42:40.640 align:start position:0%
amendment and urge the committee to vote
 
03:42:43.830 --> 03:42:43.840 align:start position:0%

state of New Hampshire we interact very
 
03:43:16.630 --> 03:43:16.640 align:start position:0%
closely with the fish and game
 
03:43:20.550 --> 03:43:20.560 align:start position:0%

holds we uh so anything affecting or
 
03:43:50.590 --> 03:43:50.600 align:start position:0%
potentially affecting the composition of
 
03:43:52.870 --> 03:43:52.880 align:start position:0%
the Fish and Game Commission is of great
 
03:43:55.670 --> 03:43:55.680 align:start position:0%
interest to us you can see we we
 
03:44:00.670 --> 03:44:00.680 align:start position:0%
interact with them a lot and changing or
 
03:44:03.389 --> 03:44:03.399 align:start position:0%
changing the commission or the and
 
03:44:06.429 --> 03:44:06.439 align:start position:0%
ultimately the the commission's goals
 
03:44:08.990 --> 03:44:09.000 align:start position:0%
objectives and how they view Wildlife
 
03:44:10.910 --> 03:44:10.920 align:start position:0%
Management we look at it from the
 
03:44:13.189 --> 03:44:13.199 align:start position:0%
context of Science and law
 
03:44:16.189 --> 03:44:16.199 align:start position:0%
enforcement um for us that is a that is
 
03:44:19.389 --> 03:44:19.399 align:start position:0%
a concern um when we looked at House
 
03:44:24.189 --> 03:44:24.199 align:start position:0%
Bill 118 we saw a lot of what we'll call
 
03:44:24.199 --> 03:44:25.670 align:start position:0%
Bill 118 we saw a lot of what we'll call
unintended

03:44:25.670 --> 03:44:25.680 align:start position:0%
unintended
 
03:44:27.510 --> 03:44:27.520 align:start position:0%
consequences um and you've heard that
 
03:44:29.550 --> 03:44:29.560 align:start position:0%
throughout today's con through today's
 
03:44:31.870 --> 03:44:31.880 align:start position:0%
conversation everything about the
 
03:44:35.070 --> 03:44:35.080 align:start position:0%
501c3 to the licensed licensed
 
03:44:39.110 --> 03:44:39.120 align:start position:0%
tenure and so that was those were
 
03:44:41.710 --> 03:44:41.720 align:start position:0%
concerns that we share as
 
03:44:45.510 --> 03:44:45.520 align:start position:0%
well the U and what's also of of concern
 
03:44:49.189 --> 03:44:49.199 align:start position:0%
to us is I've I've heard of several uh
 
03:44:52.550 --> 03:44:52.560 align:start position:0%
at least two amendments being proposed
 
03:44:55.269 --> 03:44:55.279 align:start position:0%
again um haven't had the chance to look
 
03:44:58.510 --> 03:44:58.520 align:start position:0%
at those vet those with our our our my
 
03:45:01.189 --> 03:45:01.199 align:start position:0%
members and the folks that are actually
 
03:45:03.950 --> 03:45:03.960 align:start position:0%
working with fishing game on the ground
 
03:45:05.790 --> 03:45:05.800 align:start position:0%
um and getting their perspective and
 
03:45:08.189 --> 03:45:08.199 align:start position:0%
that's something that again you know
 
03:45:10.870 --> 03:45:10.880 align:start position:0%
before that the committee acts we would
 
03:45:12.990 --> 03:45:13.000 align:start position:0%
really appreciate the opportunity to see
 
03:45:15.950 --> 03:45:15.960 align:start position:0%
the amendment and have a chance to to
 
03:45:19.590 --> 03:45:19.600 align:start position:0%
vet it because again for us this this
 
03:45:22.349 --> 03:45:22.359 align:start position:0%
agency is is critical and it's it's
 
03:45:25.149 --> 03:45:25.159 align:start position:0%
really important and I just want to come
 
03:45:27.389 --> 03:45:27.399 align:start position:0%
back to one last point and that is we
 
03:45:29.070 --> 03:45:29.080 align:start position:0%
view the committee or excuse me the
 
03:45:31.149 --> 03:45:31.159 align:start position:0%
fishing game department and the
 
03:45:34.149 --> 03:45:34.159 align:start position:0%
commission which governs it uh we view
 
03:45:37.149 --> 03:45:37.159 align:start position:0%
them as a law enforcement and science
 
03:45:38.990 --> 03:45:39.000 align:start position:0%
organization and we've heard a lot today
 
03:45:40.990 --> 03:45:41.000 align:start position:0%
about Rec Recreation and including
 
03:45:43.990 --> 03:45:44.000 align:start position:0%
Recreation and I appreciate that as an
 
03:45:46.349 --> 03:45:46.359 align:start position:0%
individual who likes to recreate on the
 
03:45:48.309 --> 03:45:48.319 align:start position:0%
you know in in the state I can
 
03:45:51.189 --> 03:45:51.199 align:start position:0%
appreciate that but there is a
 
03:45:53.309 --> 03:45:53.319 align:start position:0%
Department of Natural and cultural
 
03:45:56.149 --> 03:45:56.159 align:start position:0%
resources that also has an advisory
 
03:45:58.710 --> 03:45:58.720 align:start position:0%
Council that includes many of these
 
03:46:02.469 --> 03:46:02.479 align:start position:0%
recreational interests in the state and
 
03:46:05.309 --> 03:46:05.319 align:start position:0%
again I I look at what's and some of the
 
03:46:07.950 --> 03:46:07.960 align:start position:0%
intent behind this bill and I I have to
 
03:46:10.149 --> 03:46:10.159 align:start position:0%
question is there redundancy
 
03:46:10.159 --> 03:46:10.910 align:start position:0%
question is there redundancy
with

03:46:10.910 --> 03:46:10.920 align:start position:0%
with
 
03:46:13.630 --> 03:46:13.640 align:start position:0%
dncr and kind of their mission to
 
03:46:17.030 --> 03:46:17.040 align:start position:0%
promote Recreation to promote camping in
 
03:46:20.110 --> 03:46:20.120 align:start position:0%
in our Parks as well as again Trail use
 
03:46:23.149 --> 03:46:23.159 align:start position:0%
and and Recreation on private land so I
 
03:46:25.550 --> 03:46:25.560 align:start position:0%
I wanted to raise these these points and
 
03:46:28.670 --> 03:46:28.680 align:start position:0%
again we would be happy to if the if
 
03:46:30.389 --> 03:46:30.399 align:start position:0%
there is if there are subsequent work
 
03:46:32.870 --> 03:46:32.880 align:start position:0%
sessions or discussions about moving
 
03:46:35.189 --> 03:46:35.199 align:start position:0%
some type of change to the commission
 
03:46:37.990 --> 03:46:38.000 align:start position:0%
forward we'd be happy to to be a part of

session into uh hearing we're here to do
 
04:59:52.430 --> 04:59:52.440 align:start position:0%
a work session on all the bills that
 
04:59:54.470 --> 04:59:54.480 align:start position:0%
were presented this morning just have a
 
04:59:56.548 --> 04:59:56.558 align:start position:0%
general discussion uh make sure I'll
 
04:59:57.990 --> 04:59:58.000 align:start position:0%
summarize what everybody said to make
 
04:59:59.750 --> 04:59:59.760 align:start position:0%
sure everyone's clear on which way they
 
05:00:02.150 --> 05:00:02.160 align:start position:0%
want to vote and then at the conclusion
 
05:00:04.070 --> 05:00:04.080 align:start position:0%
of the work session on all six bills
 
05:00:06.590 --> 05:00:06.600 align:start position:0%
we'll jump into the executive session on
 
05:00:08.990 --> 05:00:09.000 align:start position:0%
all six bills is everybody clear on the
 
05:00:12.110 --> 05:00:12.120 align:start position:0%
procedure great all right so first up
 
05:00:14.190 --> 05:00:14.200 align:start position:0%
question Mr chair yes represent SP in
 
05:00:20.390 --> 05:00:20.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:22.628 --> 05:00:22.638 align:start position:0%
session so the question was will we
 
05:00:24.708 --> 05:00:24.718 align:start position:0%
allow the department or to answer
 
05:00:26.230 --> 05:00:26.240 align:start position:0%
questions if a member has question he
 
05:00:27.948 --> 05:00:27.958 align:start position:0%
answers yes that's why I asked the
 
05:00:30.910 --> 05:00:30.920 align:start position:0%
colonel to come and attend in person so
 
05:00:33.948 --> 05:00:33.958 align:start position:0%
first up was um House Bill 5 29 relative
 
05:00:36.708 --> 05:00:36.718 align:start position:0%
the cruelty of wild animal fishing and
 
05:00:40.750 --> 05:00:40.760 align:start position:0%
wild birds um is there the general
 
05:00:43.190 --> 05:00:43.200 align:start position:0%
consensus I thought on on the committee
 
05:00:45.310 --> 05:00:45.320 align:start position:0%
was an notop pass type of motion on this
 
05:00:47.230 --> 05:00:47.240 align:start position:0%
bill that everyone seemed to think that
 
05:00:49.470 --> 05:00:49.480 align:start position:0%
there was a good need for this bill I
 
05:00:51.628 --> 05:00:51.638 align:start position:0%
believe the fishing Game Commission
 
05:00:54.708 --> 05:00:54.718 align:start position:0%
testified in favor of this bill um so
 
05:00:55.750 --> 05:00:55.760 align:start position:0%
we'll open up for discussion does
 
05:00:57.708 --> 05:00:57.718 align:start position:0%
anybody have anything to say about House
 
05:00:57.718 --> 05:01:01.350 align:start position:0%
anybody have anything to say about House
Bill

05:01:01.350 --> 05:01:01.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:03.548 --> 05:01:03.558 align:start position:0%
529 there being this is going to be a
 
05:01:05.708 --> 05:01:05.718 align:start position:0%
really quick work session what about on
 
05:01:07.350 --> 05:01:07.360 align:start position:0%
video I'm sorry I wasn't looking at that
 
05:01:09.270 --> 05:01:09.280 align:start position:0%
does anybody on video have anything to
 
05:01:13.230 --> 05:01:13.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:15.750 --> 05:01:15.760 align:start position:0%
anything all right moving on from House
 
05:01:15.760 --> 05:01:17.110 align:start position:0%
anything all right moving on from House
Bill

05:01:17.110 --> 05:01:17.120 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
05:01:20.190 --> 05:01:20.200 align:start position:0%
529 next up is House Bill 192 this is
 
05:01:22.270 --> 05:01:22.280 align:start position:0%
relative to pistols uh permitted for
 
05:01:24.430 --> 05:01:24.440 align:start position:0%
taking deer this bill was the bill that
 
05:01:26.510 --> 05:01:26.520 align:start position:0%
adjusted number of calibers and
 
05:01:30.470 --> 05:01:30.480 align:start position:0%
increased the rounds to six um the
 
05:01:34.030 --> 05:01:34.040 align:start position:0%
general consensus was this was if I call
 
05:01:37.310 --> 05:01:37.320 align:start position:0%
um a modernization uh bringing the uh
 
05:01:41.708 --> 05:01:41.718 align:start position:0%
statute up to uh current technology um
 
05:01:44.230 --> 05:01:44.240 align:start position:0%
and increasing the six uh the rounds to
 
05:01:46.548 --> 05:01:46.558 align:start position:0%
six from five was an equity issue of
 
05:01:48.150 --> 05:01:48.160 align:start position:0%
revolving revolvers and there were some
 
05:01:50.150 --> 05:01:50.160 align:start position:0%
accidental issues where people who are
 
05:01:52.510 --> 05:01:52.520 align:start position:0%
carrying revolvers if it was for their
 
05:01:54.270 --> 05:01:54.280 align:start position:0%
personal safety you'd only have six
 
05:01:55.510 --> 05:01:55.520 align:start position:0%
rounds but if you're hunting with it
 
05:01:57.110 --> 05:01:57.120 align:start position:0%
you'd have five and it could potentially
 
05:01:59.150 --> 05:01:59.160 align:start position:0%
cause a problem with enforcement and
 
05:02:00.708 --> 05:02:00.718 align:start position:0%
after hearing from Colonel Jordan I
 
05:02:03.110 --> 05:02:03.120 align:start position:0%
think we all he they the Department
 
05:02:04.788 --> 05:02:04.798 align:start position:0%
agreed on six rounds across the board
 
05:02:06.910 --> 05:02:06.920 align:start position:0%
was a good idea so we'll open up for
 
05:02:08.510 --> 05:02:08.520 align:start position:0%
discussion on that summary and if
 
05:02:12.788 --> 05:02:12.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:16.390 --> 05:02:16.400 align:start position:0%
that representative wolf go ahead um I
 
05:02:19.590 --> 05:02:19.600 align:start position:0%
believe that I heard the colonels thank
 
05:02:23.190 --> 05:02:23.200 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question um I can go
 
05:02:24.910 --> 05:02:24.920 align:start position:0%
along with this based on the colonel
 
05:02:27.788 --> 05:02:27.798 align:start position:0%
thing I am opposed to raising the number
 
05:02:30.910 --> 05:02:30.920 align:start position:0%
to Six and especially on the next bill
 
05:02:33.590 --> 05:02:33.600 align:start position:0%
coming up so
 
05:02:36.390 --> 05:02:36.400 align:start position:0%
uh it's a tough one for
 
05:02:39.510 --> 05:02:39.520 align:start position:0%
me understood um again I think the idea
 
05:02:41.430 --> 05:02:41.440 align:start position:0%
was to have uniformity for enforcement
 
05:02:45.110 --> 05:02:45.120 align:start position:0%
Powers was the best best overall
 
05:02:48.070 --> 05:02:48.080 align:start position:0%
answer any other discussion on House
 
05:02:48.080 --> 05:02:49.948 align:start position:0%
answer any other discussion on House
Bill

05:02:49.948 --> 05:02:49.958 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
05:02:55.110 --> 05:02:55.120 align:start position:0%
192 seeing none uh going to House Bill
 
05:02:57.868 --> 05:02:57.878 align:start position:0%
342 relative to taking a gain by certain
 
05:03:01.270 --> 05:03:01.280 align:start position:0%
lever action Firearms um summarize again
 
05:03:03.868 --> 05:03:03.878 align:start position:0%
this this would allow action car beans
 
05:03:07.070 --> 05:03:07.080 align:start position:0%
in the pistol and shotgun areas uh
 
05:03:08.948 --> 05:03:08.958 align:start position:0%
chambered in the same handgun rounds
 
05:03:11.868 --> 05:03:11.878 align:start position:0%
that are already allowed in handguns uh
 
05:03:14.470 --> 05:03:14.480 align:start position:0%
I think the summary was that while this
 
05:03:16.788 --> 05:03:16.798 align:start position:0%
does increase potential muzzle velocity
 
05:03:19.150 --> 05:03:19.160 align:start position:0%
as the that muzzle velocity increases
 
05:03:20.788 --> 05:03:20.798 align:start position:0%
still less than some other rounds that
 
05:03:22.470 --> 05:03:22.480 align:start position:0%
are already allowed through the new
 
05:03:24.830 --> 05:03:24.840 align:start position:0%
technologies with shotguns and black
 
05:03:28.990 --> 05:03:29.000 align:start position:0%
powder rifles and that um we'll have I
 
05:03:30.548 --> 05:03:30.558 align:start position:0%
believe represent Spain will be bring an
 
05:03:32.670 --> 05:03:32.680 align:start position:0%
amendment up into adjust the stat
 
05:03:35.430 --> 05:03:35.440 align:start position:0%
statute that the colonel referenced that
 
05:03:38.430 --> 05:03:38.440 align:start position:0%
um limits the number of rounds to five
 
05:03:41.310 --> 05:03:41.320 align:start position:0%
and bring everything consistent with six
 
05:03:43.510 --> 05:03:43.520 align:start position:0%
um was there any other discussion on
 
05:03:44.708 --> 05:03:44.718 align:start position:0%
that I know there was some discussion
 
05:03:44.718 --> 05:03:45.708 align:start position:0%
that I know there was some discussion
around

05:03:45.708 --> 05:03:45.718 align:start position:0%
around
 
05:03:49.430 --> 05:03:49.440 align:start position:0%
municipalities um and again my uh you
 
05:03:52.270 --> 05:03:52.280 align:start position:0%
know there this was a properly noticed
 
05:03:55.070 --> 05:03:55.080 align:start position:0%
um meeting so the municipalities is
 
05:03:56.190 --> 05:03:56.200 align:start position:0%
along with the New Hampshire Municipal
 
05:03:58.150 --> 05:03:58.160 align:start position:0%
assciation who I know from previous
 
05:04:00.628 --> 05:04:00.638 align:start position:0%
contact very actively work looks at
 
05:04:02.670 --> 05:04:02.680 align:start position:0%
legislation so they had a chance that
 
05:04:04.310 --> 05:04:04.320 align:start position:0%
weigh in here and they still have a
 
05:04:06.150 --> 05:04:06.160 align:start position:0%
chance to weigh in here as if we pass
 
05:04:08.510 --> 05:04:08.520 align:start position:0%
this bill with an otpa it'll still go to
 
05:04:09.628 --> 05:04:09.638 align:start position:0%
the Senate and they'll have plenty of
 
05:04:11.430 --> 05:04:11.440 align:start position:0%
time to introduce and have conversation
 
05:04:13.270 --> 05:04:13.280 align:start position:0%
over in the Senate so I'll open it up
 
05:04:13.280 --> 05:04:14.230 align:start position:0%
over in the Senate so I'll open it up
for

05:04:14.230 --> 05:04:14.240 align:start position:0%
for
 
05:04:17.788 --> 05:04:17.798 align:start position:0%
discussion representative wolf I uh I
 
05:04:20.830 --> 05:04:20.840 align:start position:0%
like representative Spain's Amendment it
 
05:04:24.750 --> 05:04:24.760 align:start position:0%
now is going to make it easier for the
 
05:04:28.830 --> 05:04:28.840 align:start position:0%
uh conservation officers to enforce the
 
05:04:31.310 --> 05:04:31.320 align:start position:0%
the law equally everybody will have the
 
05:04:34.590 --> 05:04:34.600 align:start position:0%
same number of rounds and their weapons
 
05:04:36.070 --> 05:04:36.080 align:start position:0%
I am
 
05:04:36.080 --> 05:04:37.708 align:start position:0%
I am
concerned

05:04:37.708 --> 05:04:37.718 align:start position:0%
concerned
 
05:04:41.708 --> 05:04:41.718 align:start position:0%
that this bill May backfire on us and if
 
05:04:43.670 --> 05:04:43.680 align:start position:0%
the people in some of these towns that
 
05:04:46.750 --> 05:04:46.760 align:start position:0%
have voted certain limits end up Banning
 
05:04:48.590 --> 05:04:48.600 align:start position:0%
things we're going to have some awful
 
05:04:51.190 --> 05:04:51.200 align:start position:0%
egg on our face I don't know what else
 
05:04:53.670 --> 05:04:53.680 align:start position:0%
we can do but I'm going to vote against
 
05:04:55.628 --> 05:04:55.638 align:start position:0%
it for that very reason I don't want to
 
05:04:58.670 --> 05:04:58.680 align:start position:0%
see further restrictions on
 
05:05:00.628 --> 05:05:00.638 align:start position:0%
Hunting thank you representative so
 
05:05:02.070 --> 05:05:02.080 align:start position:0%
we're speaking I think you're speaking
 
05:05:04.830 --> 05:05:04.840 align:start position:0%
to the fact the towns may not understand
 
05:05:06.430 --> 05:05:06.440 align:start position:0%
the message and the overall safety that
 
05:05:07.910 --> 05:05:07.920 align:start position:0%
we were just talking about the fact that
 
05:05:10.230 --> 05:05:10.240 align:start position:0%
these weapons are due to the accuracy
 
05:05:11.670 --> 05:05:11.680 align:start position:0%
can increase safety but that message
 
05:05:12.788 --> 05:05:12.798 align:start position:0%
going to get lost is that what you're
 
05:05:16.990 --> 05:05:17.000 align:start position:0%
saying exactly thank you and we also
 
05:05:19.150 --> 05:05:19.160 align:start position:0%
have discussion on House Bill 49 I'm
 
05:05:22.310 --> 05:05:22.320 align:start position:0%
sorry House Bill
 
05:05:27.390 --> 05:05:27.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:30.270 --> 05:05:30.280 align:start position:0%
love microphone please I have I have the
 
05:05:31.830 --> 05:05:31.840 align:start position:0%
same concerns that the representative
 
05:05:33.830 --> 05:05:33.840 align:start position:0%
wolf has um I don't want to see any
 
05:05:36.670 --> 05:05:36.680 align:start position:0%
towns Clos down to hunting and uh you
 
05:05:39.628 --> 05:05:39.638 align:start position:0%
know the the the thought that I had was
 
05:05:42.430 --> 05:05:42.440 align:start position:0%
uh if we if we you know put this into a
 
05:05:46.230 --> 05:05:46.240 align:start position:0%
subcommittee and invited towns to uh to
 
05:05:48.190 --> 05:05:48.200 align:start position:0%
come and uh you know have Colonel Jordan
 
05:05:51.948 --> 05:05:51.958 align:start position:0%
do a a uh ballistics and trajectory uh
 
05:05:55.548 --> 05:05:55.558 align:start position:0%
demonstration for them uh you know maybe
 
05:05:57.670 --> 05:05:57.680 align:start position:0%
maybe not maybe not you know just uh you
 
05:05:59.750 --> 05:05:59.760 align:start position:0%
know not I'm not talking about shooting
 
05:06:02.590 --> 05:06:02.600 align:start position:0%
across the room but uh you know but you
 
05:06:05.390 --> 05:06:05.400 align:start position:0%
know bring some charts and um you know
 
05:06:07.510 --> 05:06:07.520 align:start position:0%
get them to be more comfortable and uh
 
05:06:09.708 --> 05:06:09.718 align:start position:0%
that way we don't we don't face that you
 
05:06:13.030 --> 05:06:13.040 align:start position:0%
know it' be a you know a probably a
 
05:06:15.670 --> 05:06:15.680 align:start position:0%
month uh you know difference if we
 
05:06:19.110 --> 05:06:19.120 align:start position:0%
passed it uh this next session uh you
 
05:06:21.470 --> 05:06:21.480 align:start position:0%
know um I I think we we ought to tread
 
05:06:24.070 --> 05:06:24.080 align:start position:0%
lightly here and and cover our bases
 
05:06:25.510 --> 05:06:25.520 align:start position:0%
thank representative of lepers I'm close
 
05:06:28.150 --> 05:06:28.160 align:start position:0%
I believe you had a your hand
 
05:06:31.390 --> 05:06:31.400 align:start position:0%
up yes same thing as I said earlier
 
05:06:34.030 --> 05:06:34.040 align:start position:0%
about I was in miramac when that went to
 
05:06:36.030 --> 05:06:36.040 align:start position:0%
marac and that was we had over 200
 
05:06:37.990 --> 05:06:38.000 align:start position:0%
people show up and they wanted to close
 
05:06:40.708 --> 05:06:40.718 align:start position:0%
all the land period and that was more or
 
05:06:44.270 --> 05:06:44.280 align:start position:0%
less the deal we had to uh let pistol
 
05:06:47.190 --> 05:06:47.200 align:start position:0%
hunting in Barac and Bedford was right
 
05:06:48.548 --> 05:06:48.558 align:start position:0%
behind them and there was a bunch of
 
05:06:50.030 --> 05:06:50.040 align:start position:0%
other towns
 
05:06:52.548 --> 05:06:52.558 align:start position:0%
also I think here we we're just opening
 
05:06:55.110 --> 05:06:55.120 align:start position:0%
a bucket of worms I really do I think if
 
05:06:58.070 --> 05:06:58.080 align:start position:0%
we let this go through uh first place
 
05:07:00.190 --> 05:07:00.200 align:start position:0%
hadn't had no public hearing I think
 
05:07:01.470 --> 05:07:01.480 align:start position:0%
they should have had a public hearing
 
05:07:03.670 --> 05:07:03.680 align:start position:0%
and you would have had quite turnout I'm
 
05:07:07.310 --> 05:07:07.320 align:start position:0%
sure um I just think a little more work
 
05:07:09.350 --> 05:07:09.360 align:start position:0%
should be done here because I think this
 
05:07:12.310 --> 05:07:12.320 align:start position:0%
is really trouble thank you represent CL
 
05:07:13.390 --> 05:07:13.400 align:start position:0%
sister just one of your concerns the
 
05:07:15.190 --> 05:07:15.200 align:start position:0%
public hearing was this morning so again
 
05:07:16.708 --> 05:07:16.718 align:start position:0%
it was a duly noticed public hearing
 
05:07:17.948 --> 05:07:17.958 align:start position:0%
that allowed anybody who wanted to
 
05:07:19.788 --> 05:07:19.798 align:start position:0%
attend to attend it was noticed in the
 
05:07:23.190 --> 05:07:23.200 align:start position:0%
calendar um so I to be clear just I want
 
05:07:24.750 --> 05:07:24.760 align:start position:0%
to clear up that Mis misstatement that
 
05:07:26.030 --> 05:07:26.040 align:start position:0%
we did have a public hearing and
 
05:07:27.830 --> 05:07:27.840 align:start position:0%
opportunity was there and and presented
 
05:07:31.310 --> 05:07:31.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:34.510 --> 05:07:34.520 align:start position:0%
testify not everybody was tuned in I'm
 
05:07:36.548 --> 05:07:36.558 align:start position:0%
sure as always the case with the
 
05:07:39.190 --> 05:07:39.200 align:start position:0%
legislature with 600 and 700 bills not
 
05:07:40.510 --> 05:07:40.520 align:start position:0%
everybody's always tuned in to what's
 
05:07:42.230 --> 05:07:42.240 align:start position:0%
going on uh further question
 
05:07:42.240 --> 05:07:49.868 align:start position:0%
going on uh further question
representative

05:07:49.868 --> 05:07:49.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:53.430 --> 05:07:53.440 align:start position:0%
con thank you Mr chairman uh I was
 
05:07:56.788 --> 05:07:56.798 align:start position:0%
wondering can we we make the law but we
 
05:07:58.868 --> 05:07:58.878 align:start position:0%
can we do like the town and cities has
 
05:08:09.230 --> 05:08:09.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:11.708 --> 05:08:11.718 align:start position:0%
election so I I guess I looked at
 
05:08:13.548 --> 05:08:13.558 align:start position:0%
Colonel Jordan understand I'm not sure
 
05:08:16.150 --> 05:08:16.160 align:start position:0%
how the towns have how much power the
 
05:08:20.190 --> 05:08:20.200 align:start position:0%
towns have to limit not limit um either
 
05:08:23.390 --> 05:08:23.400 align:start position:0%
pistols handguns rifles shotguns and and
 
05:08:24.910 --> 05:08:24.920 align:start position:0%
how that how that plays out so if you
 
05:08:26.310 --> 05:08:26.320 align:start position:0%
want to answer that Colonel I appreciate
 
05:08:28.350 --> 05:08:28.360 align:start position:0%
it yeah they can come up with it it's
 
05:08:30.910 --> 05:08:30.920 align:start position:0%
kind of a complicated answer to it but I
 
05:08:32.548 --> 05:08:32.558 align:start position:0%
hope I make you understand so that a
 
05:08:34.868 --> 05:08:34.878 align:start position:0%
town can come up with any Town
 
05:08:37.070 --> 05:08:37.080 align:start position:0%
ordinances that they would like they
 
05:08:39.110 --> 05:08:39.120 align:start position:0%
cannot shut down a hunting season that's
 
05:08:41.470 --> 05:08:41.480 align:start position:0%
legal in other places in the state that
 
05:08:44.030 --> 05:08:44.040 align:start position:0%
they can they can restrict what's used
 
05:08:46.430 --> 05:08:46.440 align:start position:0%
for a firearm for instance the problem
 
05:08:49.230 --> 05:08:49.240 align:start position:0%
that that creates is as as a state
 
05:08:51.990 --> 05:08:52.000 align:start position:0%
agency through New Hampshire bar the
 
05:08:55.270 --> 05:08:55.280 align:start position:0%
20626 we can't enforce Town ordinances
 
05:08:56.788 --> 05:08:56.798 align:start position:0%
so the only ones that would be able to
 
05:08:59.670 --> 05:08:59.680 align:start position:0%
enforce that would be the local police
 
05:09:02.390 --> 05:09:02.400 align:start position:0%
departments um so that that would be
 
05:09:05.628 --> 05:09:05.638 align:start position:0%
complicated to do what you're suggesting
 
05:09:09.270 --> 05:09:09.280 align:start position:0%
um if you are if you are concerned about
 
05:09:11.830 --> 05:09:11.840 align:start position:0%
um how the towns are going to react I
 
05:09:13.788 --> 05:09:13.798 align:start position:0%
think a better thought would be to send
 
05:09:15.390 --> 05:09:15.400 align:start position:0%
it over to
 
05:09:18.190 --> 05:09:18.200 align:start position:0%
Municipal uh committee and let the town
 
05:09:19.788 --> 05:09:19.798 align:start position:0%
if you if you think that's necessary and
 
05:09:22.548 --> 05:09:22.558 align:start position:0%
let the towns review it there uh if
 
05:09:23.910 --> 05:09:23.920 align:start position:0%
there's a belief that they pay more
 
05:09:25.350 --> 05:09:25.360 align:start position:0%
attention to that committee than they do
 
05:09:27.030 --> 05:09:27.040 align:start position:0%
else I agree with the chairman I think
 
05:09:29.910 --> 05:09:29.920 align:start position:0%
it's been noticed we've had it you know
 
05:09:31.830 --> 05:09:31.840 align:start position:0%
it's been out I think if people were
 
05:09:33.150 --> 05:09:33.160 align:start position:0%
concerned concerned about it that they
 
05:09:35.670 --> 05:09:35.680 align:start position:0%
would be here but I also worry that a
 
05:09:37.670 --> 05:09:37.680 align:start position:0%
knee-jerk reaction would shut a whole
 
05:09:39.830 --> 05:09:39.840 align:start position:0%
town down they could shut their land
 
05:09:42.350 --> 05:09:42.360 align:start position:0%
down and not allow people access to
 
05:09:43.750 --> 05:09:43.760 align:start position:0%
their properties and that would hurt the
 
05:09:46.350 --> 05:09:46.360 align:start position:0%
sportsmen and women so so I have a
 
05:09:49.350 --> 05:09:49.360 align:start position:0%
concern about that I share that
 
05:09:51.150 --> 05:09:51.160 align:start position:0%
concern thank you Colonel let to be
 
05:09:52.868 --> 05:09:52.878 align:start position:0%
clear I just want to you said they can't
 
05:09:54.548 --> 05:09:54.558 align:start position:0%
shut the hunting season down but they
 
05:09:57.070 --> 05:09:57.080 align:start position:0%
could close Municipal land to hunting is
 
05:09:58.708 --> 05:09:58.718 align:start position:0%
what your statement is they can come up
 
05:10:00.350 --> 05:10:00.360 align:start position:0%
with their own town when they start
 
05:10:01.670 --> 05:10:01.680 align:start position:0%
interfering with state law they don't
 
05:10:02.990 --> 05:10:03.000 align:start position:0%
have that
 
05:10:05.750 --> 05:10:05.760 align:start position:0%
thank you R
 
05:10:08.350 --> 05:10:08.360 align:start position:0%
Spain thank you Mr chair I wanted to
 
05:10:09.948 --> 05:10:09.958 align:start position:0%
clarify something Colonel Jordan because
 
05:10:13.030 --> 05:10:13.040 align:start position:0%
it's uh runs counter to my belief as uh
 
05:10:15.548 --> 05:10:15.558 align:start position:0%
someone who sat on the budget committee
 
05:10:17.670 --> 05:10:17.680 align:start position:0%
and accepted donated lands to the town
 
05:10:20.990 --> 05:10:21.000 align:start position:0%
for many many years um there was an
 
05:10:23.628 --> 05:10:23.638 align:start position:0%
understanding and um a law that said
 
05:10:25.510 --> 05:10:25.520 align:start position:0%
that you could not restrict that land
 
05:10:27.470 --> 05:10:27.480 align:start position:0%
from use by every person in the
 
05:10:28.750 --> 05:10:28.760 align:start position:0%
community if it was owned by the
 
05:10:32.070 --> 05:10:32.080 align:start position:0%
community that they were able to uh say
 
05:10:34.030 --> 05:10:34.040 align:start position:0%
for example take parts of the land and
 
05:10:36.350 --> 05:10:36.360 align:start position:0%
say you can't use an ATV or a a
 
05:10:38.430 --> 05:10:38.440 align:start position:0%
motorcycle on it but they could not shut
 
05:10:41.670 --> 05:10:41.680 align:start position:0%
hunting down and we in fact successfully
 
05:10:43.590 --> 05:10:43.600 align:start position:0%
made them reopen some lands they tried
 
05:10:45.390 --> 05:10:45.400 align:start position:0%
to close in Deerfield when they tried to
 
05:10:47.110 --> 05:10:47.120 align:start position:0%
shut those down after they were donated
 
05:10:50.270 --> 05:10:50.280 align:start position:0%
to the town so a municipal parcel that's
 
05:10:52.310 --> 05:10:52.320 align:start position:0%
owned by all the people in the community
 
05:10:53.910 --> 05:10:53.920 align:start position:0%
cannot be shut down so that certain
 
05:10:55.510 --> 05:10:55.520 align:start position:0%
community members cannot use it for
 
05:10:58.990 --> 05:10:59.000 align:start position:0%
hunting in my belief well they they can
 
05:11:01.150 --> 05:11:01.160 align:start position:0%
actually in some in some towns have
 
05:11:02.628 --> 05:11:02.638 align:start position:0%
tried that
 
05:11:03.990 --> 05:11:04.000 align:start position:0%
was a huge battle they were going to
 
05:11:06.070 --> 05:11:06.080 align:start position:0%
close all their town I agree with you
 
05:11:08.070 --> 05:11:08.080 align:start position:0%
they can't shut down the public access
 
05:11:10.270 --> 05:11:10.280 align:start position:0%
to it but they could restrict certain
 
05:11:13.310 --> 05:11:13.320 align:start position:0%
types of activity on it based on a whole
 
05:11:15.310 --> 05:11:15.320 align:start position:0%
host of reasons and what they would use
 
05:11:17.030 --> 05:11:17.040 align:start position:0%
I think in this case would be safety
 
05:11:18.670 --> 05:11:18.680 align:start position:0%
they'd be concerned about public safety
 
05:11:21.030 --> 05:11:21.040 align:start position:0%
and wellbeing so I think they I mean I
 
05:11:23.030 --> 05:11:23.040 align:start position:0%
don't know I would think they would have
 
05:11:27.788 --> 05:11:27.798 align:start position:0%
some success if they wanted to do that
 
05:11:30.948 --> 05:11:30.958 align:start position:0%
followup and going on that we just
 
05:11:32.868 --> 05:11:32.878 align:start position:0%
talked about municipal lands how much
 
05:11:34.750 --> 05:11:34.760 align:start position:0%
governance would they have if I owned a
 
05:11:37.830 --> 05:11:37.840 align:start position:0%
200 acre tra of land within that town to
 
05:11:40.070 --> 05:11:40.080 align:start position:0%
tell me I can no longer hunt on my land
 
05:11:41.430 --> 05:11:41.440 align:start position:0%
I don't think they could do that or
 
05:11:43.110 --> 05:11:43.120 align:start position:0%
could open it to another person to hunt
 
05:11:44.788 --> 05:11:44.798 align:start position:0%
on my land I don't think they could
 
05:11:46.990 --> 05:11:47.000 align:start position:0%
control private properties I'd be
 
05:11:48.830 --> 05:11:48.840 align:start position:0%
concerned just about town properties I
 
05:11:50.628 --> 05:11:50.638 align:start position:0%
don't think private I know private
 
05:11:51.628 --> 05:11:51.638 align:start position:0%
properties they wouldn't have any
 
05:11:55.590 --> 05:11:55.600 align:start position:0%
Authority on but Town lands they would
 
05:11:57.350 --> 05:11:57.360 align:start position:0%
so con to be clear the town could make
 
05:12:00.150 --> 05:12:00.160 align:start position:0%
an ordinance relev only to the land
 
05:12:02.830 --> 05:12:02.840 align:start position:0%
owned by the town but not any other land
 
05:12:04.270 --> 05:12:04.280 align:start position:0%
that's owned any prly by any private
 
05:12:06.708 --> 05:12:06.718 align:start position:0%
person thank
 
05:12:09.750 --> 05:12:09.760 align:start position:0%
you any further discussion uh I'm sorry
 
05:12:11.470 --> 05:12:11.480 align:start position:0%
uh representative dville you had your
 
05:12:14.150 --> 05:12:14.160 align:start position:0%
hand raised go unmute yourself thank you
 
05:12:17.990 --> 05:12:18.000 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman uh I I kind of echo the same
 
05:12:22.190 --> 05:12:22.200 align:start position:0%
uh remarks by uh representative wolf I
 
05:12:24.110 --> 05:12:24.120 align:start position:0%
think that
 
05:12:27.788 --> 05:12:27.798 align:start position:0%
um uh it needs to go to Municipal
 
05:12:30.350 --> 05:12:30.360 align:start position:0%
because even though it was duly uh
 
05:12:34.868 --> 05:12:34.878 align:start position:0%
noticed as a a a public meeting I know
 
05:12:38.150 --> 05:12:38.160 align:start position:0%
my town small town is dealing with a
 
05:12:42.948 --> 05:12:42.958 align:start position:0%
myriad of issues and uh we have a new
 
05:12:42.958 --> 05:12:43.830 align:start position:0%
myriad of issues and uh we have a new
Town

05:12:43.830 --> 05:12:43.840 align:start position:0%
Town
 
05:12:46.788 --> 05:12:46.798 align:start position:0%
Administrator and I'm sure he may not be
 
05:12:51.310 --> 05:12:51.320 align:start position:0%
attuned to looking at fishing game for
 
05:12:53.868 --> 05:12:53.878 align:start position:0%
uh issues that might be impacting the
 
05:12:56.868 --> 05:12:56.878 align:start position:0%
town I think it would be a matter of
 
05:13:00.750 --> 05:13:00.760 align:start position:0%
public relations to afford the towns an
 
05:13:03.430 --> 05:13:03.440 align:start position:0%
opportunity to to at least have a
 
05:13:06.590 --> 05:13:06.600 align:start position:0%
hearing in Municipal so that they could
 
05:13:09.270 --> 05:13:09.280 align:start position:0%
present themselves in that
 
05:13:09.280 --> 05:13:10.948 align:start position:0%
present themselves in that
manner

05:13:10.948 --> 05:13:10.958 align:start position:0%
manner
 
05:13:14.788 --> 05:13:14.798 align:start position:0%
uh and uh if I
 
05:13:17.628 --> 05:13:17.638 align:start position:0%
mean it sounds legitimate to me it's
 
05:13:20.788 --> 05:13:20.798 align:start position:0%
good I my major concern was safety but
 
05:13:23.990 --> 05:13:24.000 align:start position:0%
the the colonel and representativ Spain
 
05:13:28.590 --> 05:13:28.600 align:start position:0%
have kind of allayed my my fears there
 
05:13:31.390 --> 05:13:31.400 align:start position:0%
uh but I still think a matter of public
 
05:13:33.628 --> 05:13:33.638 align:start position:0%
relation I hate to say this but public
 
05:13:37.270 --> 05:13:37.280 align:start position:0%
relations Is to to at least give the
 
05:13:41.270 --> 05:13:41.280 align:start position:0%
municipalities a heads up uh and to to
 
05:13:45.430 --> 05:13:45.440 align:start position:0%
hope that it goes to uh the Senate where
 
05:13:47.990 --> 05:13:48.000 align:start position:0%
they will deal with it we're often told
 
05:13:50.510 --> 05:13:50.520 align:start position:0%
in the house we don't even consider
 
05:13:53.230 --> 05:13:53.240 align:start position:0%
people on the other side of the wall uh
 
05:13:55.548 --> 05:13:55.558 align:start position:0%
at least that's what my inference is
 
05:13:59.110 --> 05:13:59.120 align:start position:0%
always been uh I think we we need to
 
05:14:02.708 --> 05:14:02.718 align:start position:0%
give the M municipalities a shot at
 
05:14:05.390 --> 05:14:05.400 align:start position:0%
because I I think it's it is naive to
 
05:14:09.750 --> 05:14:09.760 align:start position:0%
think that the just because it was duly
 
05:14:11.510 --> 05:14:11.520 align:start position:0%
know that they're going to show up I
 
05:14:12.910 --> 05:14:12.920 align:start position:0%
think it's going to fall through the
 
05:14:17.390 --> 05:14:17.400 align:start position:0%
cracks so that that's my uh my take on
 
05:14:19.948 --> 05:14:19.958 align:start position:0%
it so we're in lucking that in this room
 
05:14:21.868 --> 05:14:21.878 align:start position:0%
we have a former speaker of the house
 
05:14:23.948 --> 05:14:23.958 align:start position:0%
that I can ask a question of somewhere
 
05:14:25.750 --> 05:14:25.760 align:start position:0%
so repr maybe you can answer that is
 
05:14:28.948 --> 05:14:28.958 align:start position:0%
there a way for a chair to well not
 
05:14:30.030 --> 05:14:30.040 align:start position:0%
require but at least make a
 
05:14:32.190 --> 05:14:32.200 align:start position:0%
recommendation to leadership that
 
05:14:34.270 --> 05:14:34.280 align:start position:0%
um this bill be referred to a second
 
05:14:36.910 --> 05:14:36.920 align:start position:0%
committee without it's just a probably a
 
05:14:47.070 --> 05:14:47.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:55.948 --> 05:14:55.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:58.830 --> 05:14:58.840 align:start position:0%
right so I I'd consider if we did notp
 
05:15:00.510 --> 05:15:00.520 align:start position:0%
motion I would I would consider doing
 
05:15:02.708 --> 05:15:02.718 align:start position:0%
that for the committee if that's will to
 
05:15:04.910 --> 05:15:04.920 align:start position:0%
make a recommendation that this bill be
 
05:15:06.150 --> 05:15:06.160 align:start position:0%
referred over to Municipal and County
 
05:15:07.270 --> 05:15:07.280 align:start position:0%
government to give the chance for
 
05:15:08.470 --> 05:15:08.480 align:start position:0%
another hearing over there that
 
05:15:11.070 --> 05:15:11.080 align:start position:0%
Municipal Association could weigh in
 
05:15:13.708 --> 05:15:13.718 align:start position:0%
on uh with that
 
05:15:16.190 --> 05:15:16.200 align:start position:0%
recommendation uh your word that that's
 
05:15:18.948 --> 05:15:18.958 align:start position:0%
what we we'll do I could support this
 
05:15:22.310 --> 05:15:22.320 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you any further discussion on
 
05:15:25.910 --> 05:15:25.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:29.110 --> 05:15:29.120 align:start position:0%
342 there're being on we'll move on to
 
05:15:32.430 --> 05:15:32.440 align:start position:0%
House Bill 490 which I'm sorry yeah uh
 
05:15:35.390 --> 05:15:35.400 align:start position:0%
permitted use of liveaction game cams I
 
05:15:37.190 --> 05:15:37.200 align:start position:0%
think summarize the testimony I think we
 
05:15:38.670 --> 05:15:38.680 align:start position:0%
heard there were a lot of problems uh
 
05:15:40.070 --> 05:15:40.080 align:start position:0%
with this bill but there also some
 
05:15:42.910 --> 05:15:42.920 align:start position:0%
concerns going forward um there was some
 
05:15:45.270 --> 05:15:45.280 align:start position:0%
discussion around uh allowing people
 
05:15:48.788 --> 05:15:48.798 align:start position:0%
with disabilities as well as uh creating
 
05:15:50.948 --> 05:15:50.958 align:start position:0%
some sort of trespass statute there
 
05:15:52.990 --> 05:15:53.000 align:start position:0%
talking about the fact that you have to
 
05:15:54.750 --> 05:15:54.760 align:start position:0%
have the permission of the land owner
 
05:15:56.628 --> 05:15:56.638 align:start position:0%
before putting the live game cam on
 
05:15:58.628 --> 05:15:58.638 align:start position:0%
there so what I was hearing from that
 
05:16:00.230 --> 05:16:00.240 align:start position:0%
was that we would ask we were asking
 
05:16:02.868 --> 05:16:02.878 align:start position:0%
fishing game to go back do some Ru
 
05:16:05.310 --> 05:16:05.320 align:start position:0%
making and maybe a good idea would be to
 
05:16:07.750 --> 05:16:07.760 align:start position:0%
retain this bill for another year to use
 
05:16:09.590 --> 05:16:09.600 align:start position:0%
as a vehicle with fishing game to be
 
05:16:11.270 --> 05:16:11.280 align:start position:0%
able to put anything we need to into
 
05:16:14.548 --> 05:16:14.558 align:start position:0%
statute um if that is not anybody else's
 
05:16:15.708 --> 05:16:15.718 align:start position:0%
understanding we'll open it up and have
 
05:16:15.718 --> 05:16:17.350 align:start position:0%
understanding we'll open it up and have
a

05:16:17.350 --> 05:16:17.360 align:start position:0%
a
 
05:16:21.470 --> 05:16:21.480 align:start position:0%
discussion representative close sorry
 
05:16:24.548 --> 05:16:24.558 align:start position:0%
Craig uh could I ask a question of the
 
05:16:27.788 --> 05:16:27.798 align:start position:0%
colal absolutely go
 
05:16:32.350 --> 05:16:32.360 align:start position:0%
ahe so uh regarding this uh if we leave
 
05:16:35.590 --> 05:16:35.600 align:start position:0%
this to Ru making uh I believe the rules
 
05:16:37.628 --> 05:16:37.638 align:start position:0%
for tree stands are all ready that you
 
05:16:39.628 --> 05:16:39.638 align:start position:0%
have to have permission to place on
 
05:16:41.670 --> 05:16:41.680 align:start position:0%
private land and they have to be tagged
 
05:16:42.868 --> 05:16:42.878 align:start position:0%
with your
 
05:16:45.350 --> 05:16:45.360 align:start position:0%
name well I want to interrupt you lose
 
05:16:49.150 --> 05:16:49.160 align:start position:0%
track many no it doesn't have they they
 
05:16:51.030 --> 05:16:51.040 align:start position:0%
have to have landowner permission
 
05:16:53.510 --> 05:16:53.520 align:start position:0%
representative Craig if in fact they do
 
05:16:57.150 --> 05:16:57.160 align:start position:0%
damage so a client for instance like
 
05:16:58.788 --> 05:16:58.798 align:start position:0%
what I use I
 
05:17:01.830 --> 05:17:01.840 align:start position:0%
think you don't need land permission if
 
05:17:04.510 --> 05:17:04.520 align:start position:0%
you cut threee GRS you do and you there
 
05:17:06.868 --> 05:17:06.878 align:start position:0%
is not a requirement to have your name a
 
05:17:08.868 --> 05:17:08.878 align:start position:0%
lot of hunters do that to
 
05:17:13.310 --> 05:17:13.320 align:start position:0%
identify not a requirement for that so
 
05:17:15.868 --> 05:17:15.878 align:start position:0%
go ahead okay it's okay I'm I
 
05:17:18.910 --> 05:17:18.920 align:start position:0%
misunderstood then yeah I misunderstood
 
05:17:20.548 --> 05:17:20.558 align:start position:0%
but I was thinking that it would be very
 
05:17:24.030 --> 05:17:24.040 align:start position:0%
easy to roll game cams in a similar type
 
05:17:28.750 --> 05:17:28.760 align:start position:0%
of scheme and we also have make we ask
 
05:17:32.430 --> 05:17:32.440 align:start position:0%
to give permission so camera is not stry
 
05:17:34.310 --> 05:17:34.320 align:start position:0%
it is something prior to the Farm Bureau
 
05:17:36.190 --> 05:17:36.200 align:start position:0%
mention of it it is something that we
 
05:17:38.070 --> 05:17:38.080 align:start position:0%
take a lot of question land owners are
 
05:17:40.230 --> 05:17:40.240 align:start position:0%
surprised when they find out there is
 
05:17:41.990 --> 05:17:42.000 align:start position:0%
not a requirement for it so it might be
 
05:17:44.910 --> 05:17:44.920 align:start position:0%
in our best interest to do I spoke with
 
05:17:49.430 --> 05:17:49.440 align:start position:0%
my rules Analyst at lunch Paul Sanderson
 
05:17:52.470 --> 05:17:52.480 align:start position:0%
and discussed possibly doing this they
 
05:17:54.990 --> 05:17:55.000 align:start position:0%
were in favor of in that
 
05:17:58.750 --> 05:17:58.760 align:start position:0%
direction excellent followup uh not not
 
05:18:00.230 --> 05:18:00.240 align:start position:0%
for the colel but just for the committee
 
05:18:04.310 --> 05:18:04.320 align:start position:0%
at large I would say that uh uh I would
 
05:18:06.310 --> 05:18:06.320 align:start position:0%
support going through the ru making
 
05:18:09.670 --> 05:18:09.680 align:start position:0%
process uh
 
05:18:13.910 --> 05:18:13.920 align:start position:0%
but restrictions on game cameras in
 
05:18:16.270 --> 05:18:16.280 align:start position:0%
general uh would apply to everyone and
 
05:18:17.470 --> 05:18:17.480 align:start position:0%
there's lots of people who aren't
 
05:18:19.590 --> 05:18:19.600 align:start position:0%
hunting who put game cams out you know
 
05:18:21.590 --> 05:18:21.600 align:start position:0%
we have our folks up in Pittsburgh who
 
05:18:24.230 --> 05:18:24.240 align:start position:0%
feed the deer despite fishing game
 
05:18:26.310 --> 05:18:26.320 align:start position:0%
warning them not to every year they they
 
05:18:28.590 --> 05:18:28.600 align:start position:0%
still do but they have their cameras out
 
05:18:31.628 --> 05:18:31.638 align:start position:0%
there or just as was brought up near
 
05:18:33.590 --> 05:18:33.600 align:start position:0%
homes people use security cameras for
 
05:18:35.628 --> 05:18:35.638 align:start position:0%
the same thing and they can be connected
 
05:18:37.270 --> 05:18:37.280 align:start position:0%
to the internet and you can get instant
 
05:18:42.590 --> 05:18:42.600 align:start position:0%
readings off of those so uh
 
05:18:45.910 --> 05:18:45.920 align:start position:0%
yeah excellent any further discussion on
 
05:18:48.708 --> 05:18:48.718 align:start position:0%
House Bill 490 it sounds like the when
 
05:18:50.310 --> 05:18:50.320 align:start position:0%
we get to the executive session the idea
 
05:18:52.110 --> 05:18:52.120 align:start position:0%
is we'll retain this bill use as a
 
05:18:53.990 --> 05:18:54.000 align:start position:0%
vehicle after rule making to see if any
 
05:18:57.990 --> 05:18:58.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:00.910 --> 05:19:00.920 align:start position:0%
law there being done moving on House
 
05:19:04.150 --> 05:19:04.160 align:start position:0%
Bill 41 an act relative to Trout um
 
05:19:05.830 --> 05:19:05.840 align:start position:0%
again I think what we discovered through
 
05:19:08.670 --> 05:19:08.680 align:start position:0%
this bill if I can all the testimony I
 
05:19:09.670 --> 05:19:09.680 align:start position:0%
think this is the most number of
 
05:19:11.430 --> 05:19:11.440 align:start position:0%
speakers we had even with the commission
 
05:19:13.548 --> 05:19:13.558 align:start position:0%
bill um this Bill had the most number of
 
05:19:15.548 --> 05:19:15.558 align:start position:0%
speakers and I but I do think the
 
05:19:18.110 --> 05:19:18.120 align:start position:0%
consensus was this is um there's a
 
05:19:19.910 --> 05:19:19.920 align:start position:0%
problem with how tightly tied the
 
05:19:21.788 --> 05:19:21.798 align:start position:0%
regulations are to this definition and
 
05:19:23.590 --> 05:19:23.600 align:start position:0%
the changes definition creates a huge
 
05:19:24.948 --> 05:19:24.958 align:start position:0%
amount of problem in
 
05:19:27.868 --> 05:19:27.878 align:start position:0%
regulations um and so even with the
 
05:19:30.310 --> 05:19:30.320 align:start position:0%
amendment that we we put for that was
 
05:19:32.948 --> 05:19:32.958 align:start position:0%
considered being put for forward um and
 
05:19:34.910 --> 05:19:34.920 align:start position:0%
I think if I heard fishing game right
 
05:19:36.390 --> 05:19:36.400 align:start position:0%
there what they'd like to do is work
 
05:19:39.390 --> 05:19:39.400 align:start position:0%
with us on this bill to be able to
 
05:19:42.310 --> 05:19:42.320 align:start position:0%
between Ru making and reopt you know
 
05:19:44.868 --> 05:19:44.878 align:start position:0%
this language later on uh we'll retain
 
05:19:46.788 --> 05:19:46.798 align:start position:0%
it again use it for a vehicle for any
 
05:19:49.628 --> 05:19:49.638 align:start position:0%
Law changes that we need um down the
 
05:19:51.110 --> 05:19:51.120 align:start position:0%
road based on the regulatory things
 
05:19:52.590 --> 05:19:52.600 align:start position:0%
they're going to do we heard from Mr
 
05:19:54.190 --> 05:19:54.200 align:start position:0%
Walsh I believe his name was who will
 
05:19:56.510 --> 05:19:56.520 align:start position:0%
submit a petition to fishing game to
 
05:19:59.190 --> 05:19:59.200 align:start position:0%
start the ru making process so is there
 
05:20:04.030 --> 05:20:04.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:07.310 --> 05:20:07.320 align:start position:0%
Mr chair I'll just quickly Mr chair go
 
05:20:10.110 --> 05:20:10.120 align:start position:0%
ahead I will just quickly say that um
 
05:20:12.910 --> 05:20:12.920 align:start position:0%
the amendment I I drafted I I had
 
05:20:15.750 --> 05:20:15.760 align:start position:0%
consulted with um local organizations
 
05:20:19.750 --> 05:20:19.760 align:start position:0%
about the bill uh and had become aware
 
05:20:21.070 --> 05:20:21.080 align:start position:0%
with the understanding that it might
 
05:20:23.030 --> 05:20:23.040 align:start position:0%
likely pass had become aware of the the
 
05:20:24.628 --> 05:20:24.638 align:start position:0%
language problems in the bill so I did
 
05:20:26.910 --> 05:20:26.920 align:start position:0%
like two days of like a crash course and
 
05:20:29.470 --> 05:20:29.480 align:start position:0%
trout and I came up with this amendment
 
05:20:31.708 --> 05:20:31.718 align:start position:0%
which uh is an improve movement but I
 
05:20:35.270 --> 05:20:35.280 align:start position:0%
wholeheartedly support um retaining it
 
05:20:36.310 --> 05:20:36.320 align:start position:0%
excellent thank you we'll make sure we
 
05:20:37.830 --> 05:20:37.840 align:start position:0%
get that Amendment over to fishing game
 
05:20:39.510 --> 05:20:39.520 align:start position:0%
to help them with the beginning basis of
 
05:20:39.520 --> 05:20:40.750 align:start position:0%
to help them with the beginning basis of
the

05:20:40.750 --> 05:20:40.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:20:44.270 --> 05:20:44.280 align:start position:0%
bill anything else on on uh House Bill
 
05:20:46.708 --> 05:20:46.718 align:start position:0%
241 relative to
 
05:20:49.948 --> 05:20:49.958 align:start position:0%
Trout seeing none next bill House Bill
 
05:20:52.310 --> 05:20:52.320 align:start position:0%
118 relative Fishing Game Commission you
 
05:20:54.310 --> 05:20:54.320 align:start position:0%
have before you two amendments that
 
05:20:56.310 --> 05:20:56.320 align:start position:0%
should be they were on the table back
 
05:20:57.750 --> 05:20:57.760 align:start position:0%
there and I hoped that lunchtime you had
 
05:21:00.750 --> 05:21:00.760 align:start position:0%
a chance to look at it um each bill each
 
05:21:00.760 --> 05:21:01.628 align:start position:0%
a chance to look at it um each bill each
amend

05:21:01.628 --> 05:21:01.638 align:start position:0%
amend
 
05:21:04.150 --> 05:21:04.160 align:start position:0%
does things just slightly different um
 
05:21:05.708 --> 05:21:05.718 align:start position:0%
and what I'll do is I'll give a few
 
05:21:08.830 --> 05:21:08.840 align:start position:0%
minutes to each um uh sponsor to be able
 
05:21:10.788 --> 05:21:10.798 align:start position:0%
to speak to their Amendment so if people
 
05:21:12.910 --> 05:21:12.920 align:start position:0%
have questions on the bill we'll start
 
05:21:14.470 --> 05:21:14.480 align:start position:0%
with representative Harvey's Amendment
 
05:21:15.708 --> 05:21:15.718 align:start position:0%
so if you want to speak to your
 
05:21:20.628 --> 05:21:20.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:23.948 --> 05:21:23.958 align:start position:0%
may um I I think I probably summarized
 
05:21:27.110 --> 05:21:27.120 align:start position:0%
things pretty accurately this morning um
 
05:21:29.590 --> 05:21:29.600 align:start position:0%
I told you how I with the process I used
 
05:21:31.910 --> 05:21:31.920 align:start position:0%
to come up with the bill
 
05:21:35.910 --> 05:21:35.920 align:start position:0%
um I talked about how um I met with fish
 
05:21:39.510 --> 05:21:39.520 align:start position:0%
and game and um we changed participating
 
05:21:42.510 --> 05:21:42.520 align:start position:0%
groups to nominating groups because that
 
05:21:45.708 --> 05:21:45.718 align:start position:0%
was the um the duty that those
 
05:21:47.948 --> 05:21:47.958 align:start position:0%
organizations were being task with at
 
05:21:52.708 --> 05:21:52.718 align:start position:0%
the moment and I talked about um the the
 
05:21:56.150 --> 05:21:56.160 align:start position:0%
license being reduced from the bill has
 
05:21:59.470 --> 05:21:59.480 align:start position:0%
two years out of the previous five um
 
05:22:01.590 --> 05:22:01.600 align:start position:0%
the amendment again
 
05:22:03.070 --> 05:22:03.080 align:start position:0%
suggested by New Hampshire fishing game
 
05:22:07.910 --> 05:22:07.920 align:start position:0%
was four out of the previous seven
 
05:22:10.430 --> 05:22:10.440 align:start position:0%
um they they felt two years was not
 
05:22:13.030 --> 05:22:13.040 align:start position:0%
enough experience and I felt that five
 
05:22:15.030 --> 05:22:15.040 align:start position:0%
years was too long so there was a
 
05:22:17.910 --> 05:22:17.920 align:start position:0%
compromise there and I think the last
 
05:22:22.390 --> 05:22:22.400 align:start position:0%
thing was um the idea that um ecology
 
05:22:25.750 --> 05:22:25.760 align:start position:0%
was added as a an area of expertise and
 
05:22:29.030 --> 05:22:29.040 align:start position:0%
it was defined as Fish and Game ecology
 
05:22:31.708 --> 05:22:31.718 align:start position:0%
so I I think I pretty much covered it
 
05:22:34.310 --> 05:22:34.320 align:start position:0%
this morning um but I I'll be happy to
 
05:22:38.230 --> 05:22:38.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:40.430 --> 05:22:40.440 align:start position:0%
have thank is anybody have any questions
 
05:22:44.670 --> 05:22:44.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:48.270 --> 05:22:48.280 align:start position:0%
Harvey great there being none we'll move
 
05:22:52.590 --> 05:22:52.600 align:start position:0%

05:22:56.510 --> 05:22:56.520 align:start position:0%

05:22:59.708 --> 05:22:59.718 align:start position:0%
oh I got a question representative
 
05:23:04.708 --> 05:23:04.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:06.470 --> 05:23:06.480 align:start position:0%

considering thank you Mr chair this is
 
05:23:46.390 --> 05:23:46.400 align:start position:0%
this is a bipartisan
 
05:23:50.070 --> 05:23:50.080 align:start position:0%
multi-and amendment to try to rectify a
 
05:23:51.510 --> 05:23:51.520 align:start position:0%
situation that we've been kicking around
 
05:23:52.390 --> 05:23:52.400 align:start position:0%
as a
 
05:23:55.350 --> 05:23:55.360 align:start position:0%
softball for for many
 
05:23:55.360 --> 05:23:58.750 align:start position:0%
softball for for many
years

05:23:58.750 --> 05:23:58.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:01.430 --> 05:24:01.440 align:start position:0%
um we have made basically all of the
 
05:24:03.070 --> 05:24:03.080 align:start position:0%
changes that the commission was looking
 
05:24:05.270 --> 05:24:05.280 align:start position:0%
to have done in their
 
05:24:08.150 --> 05:24:08.160 align:start position:0%
discussions uh on the other Amendment
 
05:24:10.750 --> 05:24:10.760 align:start position:0%
but we have uh
 
05:24:13.390 --> 05:24:13.400 align:start position:0%
specifically um added
 
05:24:15.470 --> 05:24:15.480 align:start position:0%
a a
 
05:24:17.910 --> 05:24:17.920 align:start position:0%
breakdown that says uh under the
 
05:24:20.948 --> 05:24:20.958 align:start position:0%
qualifications for Commissioners
 
05:24:24.350 --> 05:24:24.360 align:start position:0%
um we will allow one who's who's from
 
05:24:27.910 --> 05:24:27.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:30.830 --> 05:24:30.840 align:start position:0%
11 we have kept the fact that no more
 
05:24:32.510 --> 05:24:32.520 align:start position:0%
than six Commissioners shall be members
 
05:24:33.948 --> 05:24:33.958 align:start position:0%
of the same political party and the
 
05:24:35.190 --> 05:24:35.200 align:start position:0%
reason we did that even though the
 
05:24:38.510 --> 05:24:38.520 align:start position:0%
commission asked us not to uh is because
 
05:24:40.708 --> 05:24:40.718 align:start position:0%
uh we feel it keeps a better balance on
 
05:24:43.390 --> 05:24:43.400 align:start position:0%
the commission um
 
05:24:46.350 --> 05:24:46.360 align:start position:0%
and technically if anybody decides to
 
05:24:47.948 --> 05:24:47.958 align:start position:0%
call themselves Undeclared they don't
 
05:24:50.948 --> 05:24:50.958 align:start position:0%
fit either party anyway so anybody who
 
05:24:52.910 --> 05:24:52.920 align:start position:0%
is going to run for commission and is
 
05:24:54.190 --> 05:24:54.200 align:start position:0%
smart enough to call themselves
 
05:24:56.590 --> 05:24:56.600 align:start position:0%
Undeclared and I would say we probably
 
05:24:58.190 --> 05:24:58.200 align:start position:0%
want really smart people running for our
 
05:25:00.030 --> 05:25:00.040 align:start position:0%
commission is going to go ahead and make
 
05:25:01.470 --> 05:25:01.480 align:start position:0%
themselves Undeclared and then this
 
05:25:02.470 --> 05:25:02.480 align:start position:0%
becomes a
 
05:25:08.110 --> 05:25:08.120 align:start position:0%
non-issue um but um we have said that
 
05:25:13.788 --> 05:25:13.798 align:start position:0%
um we have allowed three members to be
 
05:25:16.430 --> 05:25:16.440 align:start position:0%
scientists and
 
05:25:19.230 --> 05:25:19.240 align:start position:0%
that person who's a
 
05:25:23.990 --> 05:25:24.000 align:start position:0%
scientist um must have um where we get
 
05:25:26.910 --> 05:25:26.920 align:start position:0%
to that scientist
 
05:25:30.030 --> 05:25:30.040 align:start position:0%
list either a graduate degree or five a
 
05:25:32.190 --> 05:25:32.200 align:start position:0%
bachelor years so at least three of the
 
05:25:33.948 --> 05:25:33.958 align:start position:0%
10 Commissioners appointed pursuant to
 
05:25:36.150 --> 05:25:36.160 align:start position:0%
sub paragraph 1A shall be qualified by
 
05:25:37.708 --> 05:25:37.718 align:start position:0%
holding a graduate degree in one of the
 
05:25:39.708 --> 05:25:39.718 align:start position:0%
following fields or an undergraduate
 
05:25:40.948 --> 05:25:40.958 align:start position:0%
degree with at least five years
 
05:25:42.708 --> 05:25:42.718 align:start position:0%
experience of employment as an a
 
05:25:45.110 --> 05:25:45.120 align:start position:0%
scientist in one or a combination of the
 
05:25:47.510 --> 05:25:47.520 align:start position:0%
following fields and we give eight very
 
05:25:50.070 --> 05:25:50.080 align:start position:0%
specific fields that the person only
 
05:25:51.868 --> 05:25:51.878 align:start position:0%
qualifies if they're in and they're all
 
05:25:55.590 --> 05:25:55.600 align:start position:0%
related to wildlife management and um
 
05:25:58.030 --> 05:25:58.040 align:start position:0%
and and uh ecology management here in
 
05:26:02.310 --> 05:26:02.320 align:start position:0%
the state they are very very narrowly
 
05:26:05.030 --> 05:26:05.040 align:start position:0%
uh defined simply because we don't want
 
05:26:09.350 --> 05:26:09.360 align:start position:0%
to allow extraneous Sciences to be
 
05:26:10.868 --> 05:26:10.878 align:start position:0%
considered for the fishing Game
 
05:26:12.708 --> 05:26:12.718 align:start position:0%
Commission these are all people that
 
05:26:14.190 --> 05:26:14.200 align:start position:0%
normally The Fishing Game Commission
 
05:26:16.868 --> 05:26:16.878 align:start position:0%
already takes the advice of and we're
 
05:26:19.230 --> 05:26:19.240 align:start position:0%
saying that no more than three positions
 
05:26:21.750 --> 05:26:21.760 align:start position:0%
there the three positions will be those
 
05:26:24.310 --> 05:26:24.320 align:start position:0%
uh and the rest of the 10 not counting
 
05:26:27.190 --> 05:26:27.200 align:start position:0%
the one person on the Sea Coast Are all
 
05:26:30.030 --> 05:26:30.040 align:start position:0%
uh regular as as we do now they're all
 
05:26:32.548 --> 05:26:32.558 align:start position:0%
people who are are active Outdoors
 
05:26:35.548 --> 05:26:35.558 align:start position:0%
persons but in it we close what I
 
05:26:39.350 --> 05:26:39.360 align:start position:0%
perceive as a um a slight loophole in
 
05:26:42.150 --> 05:26:42.160 align:start position:0%
the way that we do this in that uh
 
05:26:44.350 --> 05:26:44.360 align:start position:0%
currently the requirement says you have
 
05:26:47.110 --> 05:26:47.120 align:start position:0%
to hold the license for five of 10 years
 
05:26:48.628 --> 05:26:48.638 align:start position:0%
but it doesn't say you have to use that
 
05:26:50.868 --> 05:26:50.878 align:start position:0%
license for anything so you could
 
05:26:52.430 --> 05:26:52.440 align:start position:0%
essentially buy your way onto the
 
05:26:55.030 --> 05:26:55.040 align:start position:0%
commission by buying a lifetime license
 
05:26:56.510 --> 05:26:56.520 align:start position:0%
and sitting on it for five years and
 
05:26:58.190 --> 05:26:58.200 align:start position:0%
never being a person who goes out and
 
05:27:00.628 --> 05:27:00.638 align:start position:0%
hunts fishes and traps and and be
 
05:27:02.350 --> 05:27:02.360 align:start position:0%
getting that experience in the outdoors
 
05:27:03.910 --> 05:27:03.920 align:start position:0%
that we consider so valuable to the
 
05:27:07.070 --> 05:27:07.080 align:start position:0%
commission and that we want to encourage
 
05:27:09.830 --> 05:27:09.840 align:start position:0%
so by closing this loophole uh we
 
05:27:11.590 --> 05:27:11.600 align:start position:0%
basically say that you need to have the
 
05:27:14.110 --> 05:27:14.120 align:start position:0%
license for seven of the last 10 years
 
05:27:15.830 --> 05:27:15.840 align:start position:0%
and you also have to engage in The
 
05:27:17.990 --> 05:27:18.000 align:start position:0%
Taking of game for the purposes of
 
05:27:20.190 --> 05:27:20.200 align:start position:0%
hunting or trapping by having tagged or
 
05:27:23.750 --> 05:27:23.760 align:start position:0%
sealed the game or The Furs or you have
 
05:27:26.030 --> 05:27:26.040 align:start position:0%
to sign an affidavit under penalty of
 
05:27:27.830 --> 05:27:27.840 align:start position:0%
perjury that you are an active user of
 
05:27:30.150 --> 05:27:30.160 align:start position:0%
your hunting and fishing license and
 
05:27:32.030 --> 05:27:32.040 align:start position:0%
that is my understanding having talked
 
05:27:33.350 --> 05:27:33.360 align:start position:0%
with many of the Commissioners that they
 
05:27:35.548 --> 05:27:35.558 align:start position:0%
already sign an affidavit when they are
 
05:27:36.628 --> 05:27:36.638 align:start position:0%
applying for the position of
 
05:27:38.628 --> 05:27:38.638 align:start position:0%
commissioner so this would just be one
 
05:27:40.868 --> 05:27:40.878 align:start position:0%
more line in the governor's affidavit
 
05:27:42.510 --> 05:27:42.520 align:start position:0%
that is signed for the executive Council
 
05:27:42.520 --> 05:27:43.990 align:start position:0%
that is signed for the executive Council
upon

05:27:43.990 --> 05:27:44.000 align:start position:0%
upon
 
05:27:46.510 --> 05:27:46.520 align:start position:0%
nomination um I don't believe there's
 
05:27:50.150 --> 05:27:50.160 align:start position:0%
any other big changes here uh we did add
 
05:27:52.390 --> 05:27:52.400 align:start position:0%
the fact that they will lose their
 
05:27:53.750 --> 05:27:53.760 align:start position:0%
office if they move out of their
 
05:27:56.628 --> 05:27:56.638 align:start position:0%
district and they can be suspended for
 
05:27:58.350 --> 05:27:58.360 align:start position:0%
um bad
 
05:28:01.350 --> 05:28:01.360 align:start position:0%
behavior um and I believe that that is
 
05:28:06.190 --> 05:28:06.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:08.628 --> 05:28:08.638 align:start position:0%
amendment I have an additional comment
 
05:28:10.628 --> 05:28:10.638 align:start position:0%
that came up during caucus and it's just
 
05:28:12.310 --> 05:28:12.320 align:start position:0%
for the consideration of this committee
 
05:28:14.708 --> 05:28:14.718 align:start position:0%
not necessarily action and that is on
 
05:28:18.030 --> 05:28:18.040 align:start position:0%
page three uh Top Line This is the
 
05:28:20.150 --> 05:28:20.160 align:start position:0%
requirements for those seven
 
05:28:22.548 --> 05:28:22.558 align:start position:0%
Commissioners who have uh hunting
 
05:28:25.788 --> 05:28:25.798 align:start position:0%
licenses uh be active Outdoors persons
 
05:28:28.310 --> 05:28:28.320 align:start position:0%
should say and active Outdoors persons
 
05:28:31.788 --> 05:28:31.798 align:start position:0%
who hold a resident fishing hunting or
 
05:28:34.548 --> 05:28:34.558 align:start position:0%
trapping and uh in representative
 
05:28:36.910 --> 05:28:36.920 align:start position:0%
Harvey's Amendment Resident was removed
 
05:28:39.030 --> 05:28:39.040 align:start position:0%
I believe that's was a change that the
 
05:28:42.430 --> 05:28:42.440 align:start position:0%
commission was okay with um I am fine if
 
05:28:44.830 --> 05:28:44.840 align:start position:0%
this committee is fine with removing the
 
05:28:47.030 --> 05:28:47.040 align:start position:0%
word resident and the reason would be so
 
05:28:48.948 --> 05:28:48.958 align:start position:0%
that someone who has been an active
 
05:28:51.750 --> 05:28:51.760 align:start position:0%
hunter in another state could move here
 
05:28:54.150 --> 05:28:54.160 align:start position:0%
more recently than than say seven years
 
05:28:58.868 --> 05:28:58.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:02.310 --> 05:29:02.320 align:start position:0%
qualify so
 
05:29:04.030 --> 05:29:04.040 align:start position:0%
those are the two amendments even given
 
05:29:06.030 --> 05:29:06.040 align:start position:0%
represent Spain's use of analogy
 
05:29:08.670 --> 05:29:08.680 align:start position:0%
somewhere between kicking a s a softball
 
05:29:12.150 --> 05:29:12.160 align:start position:0%
not sure how that works but um malism on
 
05:29:16.350 --> 05:29:16.360 align:start position:0%
purpose um so we'll go on to open the
 
05:29:18.548 --> 05:29:18.558 align:start position:0%
discussion up for the original bill and
 
05:29:21.150 --> 05:29:21.160 align:start position:0%
the Amendments and you know freefor all
 
05:29:22.910 --> 05:29:22.920 align:start position:0%
anybody wants to speak on either either
 
05:29:26.230 --> 05:29:26.240 align:start position:0%
of these topics go ahead um and we'll go
 
05:29:27.270 --> 05:29:27.280 align:start position:0%
from there we'll start with
 
05:29:29.110 --> 05:29:29.120 align:start position:0%
representative llam Who's online in
 
05:29:33.830 --> 05:29:33.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:35.390 --> 05:29:35.400 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I actually have
 
05:29:37.830 --> 05:29:37.840 align:start position:0%
two questions one question for you and
 
05:29:39.910 --> 05:29:39.920 align:start position:0%
one question for representative
 
05:29:39.920 --> 05:29:41.470 align:start position:0%
one question for representative
Spain

05:29:41.470 --> 05:29:41.480 align:start position:0%
Spain
 
05:29:43.708 --> 05:29:43.718 align:start position:0%
um I guess I'll start with a question
 
05:29:45.948 --> 05:29:45.958 align:start position:0%
for you Mr chairman do you have the blue
 
05:29:47.548 --> 05:29:47.558 align:start position:0%
sheet numbers for this
 
05:29:54.430 --> 05:29:54.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:59.230 --> 05:29:59.240 align:start position:0%
second 36 uh in support 131
 
05:29:59.240 --> 05:30:02.270 align:start position:0%
second 36 uh in support 131
opposed

05:30:02.270 --> 05:30:02.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:03.350 --> 05:30:03.360 align:start position:0%
well at least
 
05:30:07.548 --> 05:30:07.558 align:start position:0%
people representing Spain thank you um
 
05:30:10.150 --> 05:30:10.160 align:start position:0%
you mentioned and I agree with you um
 
05:30:13.510 --> 05:30:13.520 align:start position:0%
the importance of uh of having hunting
 
05:30:16.708 --> 05:30:16.718 align:start position:0%
and fishing or trapping experience um to
 
05:30:21.310 --> 05:30:21.320 align:start position:0%
the point where we we wish to have uh
 
05:30:23.510 --> 05:30:23.520 align:start position:0%
the Commissioners well seven of them at
 
05:30:26.470 --> 05:30:26.480 align:start position:0%
least um to have at least you know seven
 
05:30:29.230 --> 05:30:29.240 align:start position:0%
years of of uh of hunting and fishing
 
05:30:32.350 --> 05:30:32.360 align:start position:0%
licenses because it's very important uh
 
05:30:34.788 --> 05:30:34.798 align:start position:0%
that they have the experience why don't
 
05:30:36.470 --> 05:30:36.480 align:start position:0%
we require that for all the
 
05:30:38.788 --> 05:30:38.798 align:start position:0%
Commissioners and we are exempting three
 
05:30:38.798 --> 05:30:42.150 align:start position:0%
Commissioners and we are exempting three
of

05:30:42.150 --> 05:30:42.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:45.030 --> 05:30:45.040 align:start position:0%
them that's a good question if it was up
 
05:30:47.390 --> 05:30:47.400 align:start position:0%
to me I would probably go ahead and
 
05:30:50.150 --> 05:30:50.160 align:start position:0%
require that for all of them but um just
 
05:30:52.390 --> 05:30:52.400 align:start position:0%
as I feel that it might be hard to find
 
05:30:54.670 --> 05:30:54.680 align:start position:0%
three scientists willing to run and that
 
05:30:56.910 --> 05:30:56.920 align:start position:0%
who would get appointed and I had wanted
 
05:31:00.230 --> 05:31:00.240 align:start position:0%
to put language in that said up to three
 
05:31:02.830 --> 05:31:02.840 align:start position:0%
so that we could have three or less
 
05:31:04.470 --> 05:31:04.480 align:start position:0%
scientists if we couldn't find a
 
05:31:06.868 --> 05:31:06.878 align:start position:0%
scientist in that category willing to
 
05:31:09.990 --> 05:31:10.000 align:start position:0%
serve um it might be difficult to find
 
05:31:11.830 --> 05:31:11.840 align:start position:0%
scientists qualifying willing to serve
 
05:31:14.310 --> 05:31:14.320 align:start position:0%
who also hold a hunting license and it's
 
05:31:16.510 --> 05:31:16.520 align:start position:0%
one of the negotiations and trade-offs I
 
05:31:23.510 --> 05:31:23.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:26.510 --> 05:31:26.520 align:start position:0%
bill so I have representative goalie in
 
05:31:29.070 --> 05:31:29.080 align:start position:0%
the attendees I'm gonna let him be
 
05:31:30.628 --> 05:31:30.638 align:start position:0%
unmuted and ask I'm not sure if he's got
 
05:31:32.430 --> 05:31:32.440 align:start position:0%
a question and wants to make a point but
 
05:31:34.030 --> 05:31:34.040 align:start position:0%
um normally wouldn't do that but he is a
 
05:31:35.030 --> 05:31:35.040 align:start position:0%
representative so I'm going to give him
 
05:31:37.510 --> 05:31:37.520 align:start position:0%
the courtesy of doing that he's allowed
 
05:31:40.150 --> 05:31:40.160 align:start position:0%
to talk if he unmutes represent goalie
 
05:31:41.350 --> 05:31:41.360 align:start position:0%
if you want to unmute yourself although
 
05:31:44.390 --> 05:31:44.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:46.708 --> 05:31:46.718 align:start position:0%
Heather thank you Mr
 
05:31:49.868 --> 05:31:49.878 align:start position:0%
chairman I appreciate the uh time
 
05:31:53.470 --> 05:31:53.480 align:start position:0%
um um bouncing back and forth between as
 
05:31:55.070 --> 05:31:55.080 align:start position:0%
my meetings going committee and watching
 
05:31:57.948 --> 05:31:57.958 align:start position:0%
your meeting at the same time
 
05:32:01.590 --> 05:32:01.600 align:start position:0%
um I I think it it's I mean
 
05:32:05.628 --> 05:32:05.638 align:start position:0%
I agree with a number of the uh
 
05:32:07.390 --> 05:32:07.400 align:start position:0%
organizations out there especially the
 
05:32:10.270 --> 05:32:10.280 align:start position:0%
hampsh Wildlife Federation uh opposed to
 
05:32:12.270 --> 05:32:12.280 align:start position:0%
this bill I think the commission has
 
05:32:13.430 --> 05:32:13.440 align:start position:0%
done a good
 
05:32:16.708 --> 05:32:16.718 align:start position:0%
job there have been maybe a hiccup here
 
05:32:19.470 --> 05:32:19.480 align:start position:0%
or there I think overall the job they
 
05:32:22.670 --> 05:32:22.680 align:start position:0%
have done um some people thinking that
 
05:32:25.750 --> 05:32:25.760 align:start position:0%
they have too much at to tasked to do I
 
05:32:27.110 --> 05:32:27.120 align:start position:0%
think if you speak to anyone out there
 
05:32:29.590 --> 05:32:29.600 align:start position:0%
in the community will tell you that for
 
05:32:31.190 --> 05:32:31.200 align:start position:0%
what they had have and the staff that
 
05:32:34.628 --> 05:32:34.638 align:start position:0%
they have it is remarkable the services
 
05:32:35.868 --> 05:32:35.878 align:start position:0%
that they
 
05:32:39.430 --> 05:32:39.440 align:start position:0%
provide um I will also go on to say
 
05:32:39.440 --> 05:32:41.030 align:start position:0%
provide um I will also go on to say
that

05:32:41.030 --> 05:32:41.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:32:44.548 --> 05:32:44.558 align:start position:0%
while some folks want to have uh
 
05:32:47.670 --> 05:32:47.680 align:start position:0%
individuals rep representing outdoor
 
05:32:50.548 --> 05:32:50.558 align:start position:0%
activities um I think a good comment was
 
05:32:52.708 --> 05:32:52.718 align:start position:0%
made that the uh Parks Division and what
 
05:32:55.510 --> 05:32:55.520 align:start position:0%
they do with the natural resources and
 
05:32:57.750 --> 05:32:57.760 align:start position:0%
uh the board that they have might be a
 
05:32:59.150 --> 05:32:59.160 align:start position:0%
better place for these folks if that's
 
05:33:01.390 --> 05:33:01.400 align:start position:0%
what they want to do
 
05:33:03.430 --> 05:33:03.440 align:start position:0%
um so I I think there are avenues for
 
05:33:06.548 --> 05:33:06.558 align:start position:0%
them to be active in the activities that
 
05:33:10.430 --> 05:33:10.440 align:start position:0%
they want um to partake
 
05:33:14.628 --> 05:33:14.638 align:start position:0%
in um with that being said I I I as the
 
05:33:16.470 --> 05:33:16.480 align:start position:0%
bill as written I would would not
 
05:33:21.230 --> 05:33:21.240 align:start position:0%
support um I think the scientific aspect
 
05:33:24.708 --> 05:33:24.718 align:start position:0%
um I we all know that fishing game does
 
05:33:24.718 --> 05:33:26.590 align:start position:0%
um I we all know that fishing game does
have

05:33:26.590 --> 05:33:26.600 align:start position:0%
have
 
05:33:28.628 --> 05:33:28.638 align:start position:0%
biologists and highly qualified
 
05:33:30.750 --> 05:33:30.760 align:start position:0%
biologists on board to answer any of the
 
05:33:32.230 --> 05:33:32.240 align:start position:0%
questions that you may
 
05:33:36.390 --> 05:33:36.400 align:start position:0%
get from having a scientist on board on
 
05:33:38.430 --> 05:33:38.440 align:start position:0%
a commission um that's that's the
 
05:33:39.990 --> 05:33:40.000 align:start position:0%
purpose of of having qualified
 
05:33:42.030 --> 05:33:42.040 align:start position:0%
individuals in your department when
 
05:33:43.788 --> 05:33:43.798 align:start position:0%
you're leading you look for the answers
 
05:33:46.310 --> 05:33:46.320 align:start position:0%
from within and if you can't get them
 
05:33:47.990 --> 05:33:48.000 align:start position:0%
within there are a number of agencies
 
05:33:50.590 --> 05:33:50.600 align:start position:0%
out there that you can reach out to um
 
05:33:52.390 --> 05:33:52.400 align:start position:0%
and we do that uh the director has
 
05:33:54.190 --> 05:33:54.200 align:start position:0%
reached out to our organization the
 
05:33:56.230 --> 05:33:56.240 align:start position:0%
Congressional sportman Foundation a
 
05:33:59.310 --> 05:33:59.320 align:start position:0%
number of times for information what
 
05:34:00.670 --> 05:34:00.680 align:start position:0%
other states are doing and we've helped
 
05:34:03.868 --> 05:34:03.878 align:start position:0%
out with that uh at this time I I would
 
05:34:07.510 --> 05:34:07.520 align:start position:0%
be opposed I'd be probably I mean
 
05:34:09.948 --> 05:34:09.958 align:start position:0%
there's so many there are a number of
 
05:34:12.670 --> 05:34:12.680 align:start position:0%
unanswered questions in which ways to go
 
05:34:15.230 --> 05:34:15.240 align:start position:0%
um whether language needs to be changed
 
05:34:17.310 --> 05:34:17.320 align:start position:0%
or re amended that it's probably
 
05:34:19.708 --> 05:34:19.718 align:start position:0%
worthwhile to retain and work a little
 
05:34:21.510 --> 05:34:21.520 align:start position:0%
further on it it's not ready for prime
 
05:34:23.548 --> 05:34:23.558 align:start position:0%
time but thank you for taking the
 
05:34:26.590 --> 05:34:26.600 align:start position:0%
comment thank you represent goalie
 
05:34:29.150 --> 05:34:29.160 align:start position:0%
anybody so on the committee we'll open
 
05:34:30.708 --> 05:34:30.718 align:start position:0%
this up for General ener discussion and
 
05:34:31.948 --> 05:34:31.958 align:start position:0%
we'll start with representative Howard
 
05:34:31.958 --> 05:34:33.510 align:start position:0%
we'll start with representative Howard
over

05:34:33.510 --> 05:34:33.520 align:start position:0%
over
 
05:34:36.990 --> 05:34:37.000 align:start position:0%
there thank you Mr chair um I just want
 
05:34:40.708 --> 05:34:40.718 align:start position:0%
to get a clarification here so I know
 
05:34:43.270 --> 05:34:43.280 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at this the right way does
 
05:34:46.390 --> 05:34:46.400 align:start position:0%
the commission make recommendations on
 
05:34:52.070 --> 05:34:52.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:53.948 --> 05:34:53.958 align:start position:0%
department maybe the colonel wants
 
05:34:55.788 --> 05:34:55.798 align:start position:0%
answer I think the answer is yes but
 
05:34:58.350 --> 05:34:58.360 align:start position:0%
I'll let the colonel I mean I
 
05:35:02.270 --> 05:35:02.280 align:start position:0%
guess the Comm involved with HS and you
 
05:35:05.510 --> 05:35:05.520 align:start position:0%
know this type so yes anything that the
 
05:35:09.030 --> 05:35:09.040 align:start position:0%
commission has legal or statutory
 
05:35:12.030 --> 05:35:12.040 align:start position:0%
authority over uh has to be presented to
 
05:35:13.788 --> 05:35:13.798 align:start position:0%
them so things like donations that come
 
05:35:17.590 --> 05:35:17.600 align:start position:0%
to the agency uh proposed legislation we
 
05:35:19.990 --> 05:35:20.000 align:start position:0%
cannot propose any legislation without
 
05:35:22.868 --> 05:35:22.878 align:start position:0%
their prior review and approval uh
 
05:35:26.190 --> 05:35:26.200 align:start position:0%
policy baking positions regarding game
 
05:35:29.470 --> 05:35:29.480 align:start position:0%
uh Seasons opening and closing uh right
 
05:35:32.270 --> 05:35:32.280 align:start position:0%
down to non-game and and Fisheries
 
05:35:34.150 --> 05:35:34.160 align:start position:0%
although Fisheries is a bit limited
 
05:35:37.750 --> 05:35:37.760 align:start position:0%
because of an old history uh law that
 
05:35:39.830 --> 05:35:39.840 align:start position:0%
was a lot of Fisheries is informational
 
05:35:40.910 --> 05:35:40.920 align:start position:0%
rather than
 
05:35:45.788 --> 05:35:45.798 align:start position:0%
regulatory um so yes we B we as I like
 
05:35:47.430 --> 05:35:47.440 align:start position:0%
to explain it to people that are
 
05:35:50.310 --> 05:35:50.320 align:start position:0%
unfamiliar we as professionals so our
 
05:35:52.350 --> 05:35:52.360 align:start position:0%
biologists which I will tell you are the
 
05:35:54.190 --> 05:35:54.200 align:start position:0%
best in the country as far as I'm
 
05:35:57.070 --> 05:35:57.080 align:start position:0%
concerned both Inland and wild we had
 
05:35:59.830 --> 05:35:59.840 align:start position:0%
plenty of Staff educated staff in that
 
05:36:03.030 --> 05:36:03.040 align:start position:0%
agency that does an outstanding job of
 
05:36:04.910 --> 05:36:04.920 align:start position:0%
managing our Wild Life resources in
 
05:36:07.270 --> 05:36:07.280 align:start position:0%
spite of what anyone in the state says I
 
05:36:10.350 --> 05:36:10.360 align:start position:0%
give you any number of examples of how
 
05:36:12.990 --> 05:36:13.000 align:start position:0%
that has been successful from turkeys to
 
05:36:15.470 --> 05:36:15.480 align:start position:0%
boost increase deer populations they do
 
05:36:15.480 --> 05:36:16.590 align:start position:0%
boost increase deer populations they do
an

05:36:16.590 --> 05:36:16.600 align:start position:0%
an
 
05:36:18.708 --> 05:36:18.718 align:start position:0%
outstanding and then they make their
 
05:36:21.470 --> 05:36:21.480 align:start position:0%
recommendations to the commission and a
 
05:36:24.030 --> 05:36:24.040 align:start position:0%
very non-aggressive a very aggressive
 
05:36:27.510 --> 05:36:27.520 align:start position:0%
non- game group uh that has really come
 
05:36:29.670 --> 05:36:29.680 align:start position:0%
along ladies in the last few years in
 
05:36:33.430 --> 05:36:33.440 align:start position:0%
bringing back almost extinct species so
 
05:36:36.788 --> 05:36:36.798 align:start position:0%
we have the talent we have the scientist
 
05:36:38.750 --> 05:36:38.760 align:start position:0%
as far as I'm concerned we have that
 
05:36:41.150 --> 05:36:41.160 align:start position:0%
there so they make these presentations
 
05:36:43.510 --> 05:36:43.520 align:start position:0%
to the to the committee and then the
 
05:36:45.230 --> 05:36:45.240 align:start position:0%
commission rather and then the
 
05:36:47.750 --> 05:36:47.760 align:start position:0%
commission has to view things a little
 
05:36:49.430 --> 05:36:49.440 align:start position:0%
differently and this is where some of us
 
05:36:51.030 --> 05:36:51.040 align:start position:0%
struggle but they're looking at the big
 
05:36:52.310 --> 05:36:52.320 align:start position:0%
picture they're not looking at a Law
 
05:36:54.230 --> 05:36:54.240 align:start position:0%
Enforcement issue they're looking at the
 
05:36:55.910 --> 05:36:55.920 align:start position:0%
Law Enforcement issue and how it affects
 
05:36:57.750 --> 05:36:57.760 align:start position:0%
the agency as a whole and they're also
 
05:36:59.830 --> 05:36:59.840 align:start position:0%
they've got a consider social issues
 
05:37:01.830 --> 05:37:01.840 align:start position:0%
something I don't always have to worry
 
05:37:04.350 --> 05:37:04.360 align:start position:0%
about uh they have to look at all of
 
05:37:06.788 --> 05:37:06.798 align:start position:0%
that so it's it's a it's a big
 
05:37:11.390 --> 05:37:11.400 align:start position:0%
job but we have the scientist to a quick
 
05:37:14.350 --> 05:37:14.360 align:start position:0%
followup so that would also include like
 
05:37:17.948 --> 05:37:17.958 align:start position:0%
uh boater access yes y okay voting
 
05:37:20.310 --> 05:37:20.320 align:start position:0%
access anything the department I can't
 
05:37:21.948 --> 05:37:21.958 align:start position:0%
say everything the Department's involved
 
05:37:23.830 --> 05:37:23.840 align:start position:0%
in but most of what the department is
 
05:37:26.990 --> 05:37:27.000 align:start position:0%
well in uh this commission is brought to
 
05:37:29.230 --> 05:37:29.240 align:start position:0%
speak remember it's like you it's a
 
05:37:32.390 --> 05:37:32.400 align:start position:0%
volunt your uh organization I mean
 
05:37:34.548 --> 05:37:34.558 align:start position:0%
there's no so you're you're asking
 
05:37:36.910 --> 05:37:36.920 align:start position:0%
people with professional lives to commit
 
05:37:38.830 --> 05:37:38.840 align:start position:0%
hundreds of hours of time to help us
 
05:37:40.750 --> 05:37:40.760 align:start position:0%
with this that's what we're get so I'm a
 
05:37:44.548 --> 05:37:44.558 align:start position:0%
little L of requiring education for and
 
05:37:46.628 --> 05:37:46.638 align:start position:0%
this is just me because you given me the
 
05:37:49.788 --> 05:37:49.798 align:start position:0%
mic so I'm a little lry sitting there
 
05:37:52.070 --> 05:37:52.080 align:start position:0%
reading that of holding or asking the
 
05:37:53.548 --> 05:37:53.558 align:start position:0%
commissioner to be held a higher
 
05:37:55.310 --> 05:37:55.320 align:start position:0%
standard then would be required to be a
 
05:37:57.708 --> 05:37:57.718 align:start position:0%
speaker of the
 
05:38:00.470 --> 05:38:00.480 align:start position:0%
house or president
 
05:38:03.150 --> 05:38:03.160 align:start position:0%
or president of our neither one of those
 
05:38:05.948 --> 05:38:05.958 align:start position:0%
positions require any right no
 
05:38:07.948 --> 05:38:07.958 align:start position:0%
bachelor's I shouldn't say that but they
 
05:38:10.670 --> 05:38:10.680 align:start position:0%
don't require a bachelor so it doesn't
 
05:38:13.110 --> 05:38:13.120 align:start position:0%
make a lot of sense to me when you say
 
05:38:15.470 --> 05:38:15.480 align:start position:0%
three of the 10 should have bachelor's
 
05:38:16.948 --> 05:38:16.958 align:start position:0%
degrees and then my next thought is so
 
05:38:19.070 --> 05:38:19.080 align:start position:0%
who gets them what count is going to
 
05:38:21.310 --> 05:38:21.320 align:start position:0%
have the Smart Ones how do you how do
 
05:38:23.868 --> 05:38:23.878 align:start position:0%
youy that so there's a lot of issues
 
05:38:23.878 --> 05:38:25.430 align:start position:0%
youy that so there's a lot of issues
with

05:38:25.430 --> 05:38:25.440 align:start position:0%
with
 
05:38:29.110 --> 05:38:29.120 align:start position:0%
that you know that that I would but they
 
05:38:29.120 --> 05:38:30.190 align:start position:0%
that you know that that I would but they
they

05:38:30.190 --> 05:38:30.200 align:start position:0%
they
 
05:38:31.990 --> 05:38:32.000 align:start position:0%
uh you know we make presentations to
 
05:38:33.830 --> 05:38:33.840 align:start position:0%
them where they hold and they don't
 
05:38:35.868 --> 05:38:35.878 align:start position:0%
always agree certainly you heard that
 
05:38:37.030 --> 05:38:37.040 align:start position:0%
today they don't always agree with
 
05:38:38.868 --> 05:38:38.878 align:start position:0%
everything that be present and sometimes
 
05:38:40.910 --> 05:38:40.920 align:start position:0%
that falls to us sometimes quite frankly
 
05:38:43.110 --> 05:38:43.120 align:start position:0%
they're wrong that's just the way it is
 
05:38:45.990 --> 05:38:46.000 align:start position:0%
but it's a system that is designed for
 
05:38:47.670 --> 05:38:47.680 align:start position:0%
give and take I think they make more
 
05:38:47.680 --> 05:38:50.628 align:start position:0%
give and take I think they make more
right

05:38:50.628 --> 05:38:50.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:55.590 --> 05:38:55.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:58.670 --> 05:38:58.680 align:start position:0%
I'm so represent Harvey go but I figured
 
05:38:59.910 --> 05:38:59.920 align:start position:0%
you might want to dig yourself out of
 
05:39:02.150 --> 05:39:02.160 align:start position:0%
that hole you just the
 
05:39:04.830 --> 05:39:04.840 align:start position:0%
spe representative Harvey go
 
05:39:07.468 --> 05:39:07.478 align:start position:0%
ahead so I I hear everything that you're
 
05:39:10.270 --> 05:39:10.280 align:start position:0%
saying um Colonel Jordan and and I can
 
05:39:14.190 --> 05:39:14.200 align:start position:0%
appreciate that um you know I kind of
 
05:39:17.430 --> 05:39:17.440 align:start position:0%
agree with bachelors and and Masters and
 
05:39:20.150 --> 05:39:20.160 align:start position:0%
PhD and so forth and that's why in my
 
05:39:23.548 --> 05:39:23.558 align:start position:0%
Amendment um I just called it coursework
 
05:39:25.310 --> 05:39:25.320 align:start position:0%
because there's many courses that are
 
05:39:27.468 --> 05:39:27.478 align:start position:0%
offered by various um organizations
 
05:39:30.310 --> 05:39:30.320 align:start position:0%
adult education uh the call program in
 
05:39:34.350 --> 05:39:34.360 align:start position:0%
Keen um Harris Center episcop Park and
 
05:39:37.430 --> 05:39:37.440 align:start position:0%
um they they're relatively free they're
 
05:39:39.910 --> 05:39:39.920 align:start position:0%
local you can take advantage of them and
 
05:39:43.270 --> 05:39:43.280 align:start position:0%
it's good education but the um although
 
05:39:46.708 --> 05:39:46.718 align:start position:0%
I'm not opposed to uh a scientist I have
 
05:39:49.468 --> 05:39:49.478 align:start position:0%
a master's plus 15 my husband's a PhD in
 
05:39:51.150 --> 05:39:51.160 align:start position:0%
Immunology so I'm not opposed to a
 
05:39:52.948 --> 05:39:52.958 align:start position:0%
scientist but it might be something that
 
05:39:55.110 --> 05:39:55.120 align:start position:0%
we should consider um and the other
 
05:39:58.230 --> 05:39:58.240 align:start position:0%
thing that's left out of um the bill is
 
05:39:59.990 --> 05:40:00.000 align:start position:0%
volunteer work you know we have many
 
05:40:03.548 --> 05:40:03.558 align:start position:0%
volunteers out there that work in um
 
05:40:05.190 --> 05:40:05.200 align:start position:0%
support a fishing game I'm sure you see
 
05:40:09.070 --> 05:40:09.080 align:start position:0%
that in your non-game department so um
 
05:40:12.110 --> 05:40:12.120 align:start position:0%
you know there are still some questions
 
05:40:14.788 --> 05:40:14.798 align:start position:0%
um but I and I just bring this up
 
05:40:17.270 --> 05:40:17.280 align:start position:0%
because you mentioned it but as a whole
 
05:40:19.830 --> 05:40:19.840 align:start position:0%
I I don't necessarily have a problem
 
05:40:21.628 --> 05:40:21.638 align:start position:0%
with that but it it is something that
 
05:40:24.350 --> 05:40:24.360 align:start position:0%
that as uh representative goolie and you
 
05:40:26.390 --> 05:40:26.400 align:start position:0%
mentioned that maybe we want to think
 
05:40:27.990 --> 05:40:28.000 align:start position:0%
about a little bit more and the other
 
05:40:29.990 --> 05:40:30.000 align:start position:0%
thing to remember I think is it's
 
05:40:33.948 --> 05:40:33.958 align:start position:0%
important is that the the biologist the
 
05:40:35.350 --> 05:40:35.360 align:start position:0%
the Fisheries biologist Wild Life
 
05:40:37.030 --> 05:40:37.040 align:start position:0%
biologist non game the law enforcement
 
05:40:39.590 --> 05:40:39.600 align:start position:0%
people are doing it 40 hours or better
 
05:40:41.548 --> 05:40:41.558 align:start position:0%
every week and we're asking
 
05:40:43.310 --> 05:40:43.320 align:start position:0%
Commissioners to come in on a very
 
05:40:45.230 --> 05:40:45.240 align:start position:0%
limited time frame to make these
 
05:40:48.548 --> 05:40:48.558 align:start position:0%
decision so they really have to rely on
 
05:40:50.430 --> 05:40:50.440 align:start position:0%
the information that we bring that's why
 
05:40:51.910 --> 05:40:51.920 align:start position:0%
you know it has to be good information
 
05:40:53.548 --> 05:40:53.558 align:start position:0%
quality information I think it's more
 
05:40:56.390 --> 05:40:56.400 align:start position:0%
important to worry about that end of the
 
05:40:59.868 --> 05:40:59.878 align:start position:0%
building being at a level of science
 
05:41:02.548 --> 05:41:02.558 align:start position:0%
and and skilled at their
 
05:41:05.070 --> 05:41:05.080 align:start position:0%
jobs more so than the volunteer group
 
05:41:08.868 --> 05:41:08.878 align:start position:0%
that's going to spend 4 hours a month
 
05:41:12.590 --> 05:41:12.600 align:start position:0%
basic a lot more certainly not 4 right
 
05:41:16.270 --> 05:41:16.280 align:start position:0%
so so oh I'm sorry so I guess I'm I'm
 
05:41:17.990 --> 05:41:18.000 align:start position:0%
asking I don't know where we are in our
 
05:41:19.948 --> 05:41:19.958 align:start position:0%
deliberations here you you call this a
 
05:41:22.628 --> 05:41:22.638 align:start position:0%
work session so and and representative
 
05:41:25.548 --> 05:41:25.558 align:start position:0%
Reed brought up the idea of um taking
 
05:41:27.070 --> 05:41:27.080 align:start position:0%
out the word resident so I don't know if
 
05:41:29.430 --> 05:41:29.440 align:start position:0%
we're you know thinking about changing
 
05:41:31.788 --> 05:41:31.798 align:start position:0%
that we want in either of the Amendments
 
05:41:33.628 --> 05:41:33.638 align:start position:0%
or are
 
05:41:36.390 --> 05:41:36.400 align:start position:0%
we I I'm asking we're in work session
 
05:41:37.750 --> 05:41:37.760 align:start position:0%
right now everything is on the table to
 
05:41:40.070 --> 05:41:40.080 align:start position:0%
discuss okay so so that that's my
 
05:41:41.990 --> 05:41:42.000 align:start position:0%
discussion with that although I'm happy
 
05:41:43.708 --> 05:41:43.718 align:start position:0%
with leaving that alone I would like the
 
05:41:47.590 --> 05:41:47.600 align:start position:0%
resident taken out um and just my two
 
05:41:51.670 --> 05:41:51.680 align:start position:0%
cents or four cents representative Reed
 
05:41:53.830 --> 05:41:53.840 align:start position:0%
uh thank you so just a couple points of
 
05:41:55.750 --> 05:41:55.760 align:start position:0%
clarification and and I brought up the
 
05:41:57.468 --> 05:41:57.478 align:start position:0%
thing about resident in case this
 
05:41:58.868 --> 05:41:58.878 align:start position:0%
committee wanted to have another
 
05:42:01.350 --> 05:42:01.360 align:start position:0%
amendment drafted that removed that also
 
05:42:03.510 --> 05:42:03.520 align:start position:0%
we may just decide to um support an
 
05:42:05.310 --> 05:42:05.320 align:start position:0%
amendment either on the floor or in the
 
05:42:09.310 --> 05:42:09.320 align:start position:0%
Senate to do uh that but um I just
 
05:42:11.590 --> 05:42:11.600 align:start position:0%
wanted to put it out there the point
 
05:42:15.510 --> 05:42:15.520 align:start position:0%
about um education so obviously just
 
05:42:17.548 --> 05:42:17.558 align:start position:0%
because it's something most of my stuff
 
05:42:20.350 --> 05:42:20.360 align:start position:0%
is in election law uh elected officials
 
05:42:22.070 --> 05:42:22.080 align:start position:0%
when you're elected the people have a
 
05:42:23.948 --> 05:42:23.958 align:start position:0%
right to be represented by who they
 
05:42:26.468 --> 05:42:26.478 align:start position:0%
select and so if they select someone who
 
05:42:28.190 --> 05:42:28.200 align:start position:0%
is completely uneducated it's still
 
05:42:30.110 --> 05:42:30.120 align:start position:0%
their choice so that's why we can't have
 
05:42:31.868 --> 05:42:31.878 align:start position:0%
requirements there's been numerous bills
 
05:42:33.910 --> 05:42:33.920 align:start position:0%
in the past trying to put requirements
 
05:42:36.468 --> 05:42:36.478 align:start position:0%
on people for running for office and
 
05:42:38.190 --> 05:42:38.200 align:start position:0%
they are almost universally struck down
 
05:42:39.750 --> 05:42:39.760 align:start position:0%
as unconstitutional because if the
 
05:42:42.350 --> 05:42:42.360 align:start position:0%
people select that person that person is
 
05:42:44.430 --> 05:42:44.440 align:start position:0%
their representative regardless of their
 
05:42:46.548 --> 05:42:46.558 align:start position:0%
qualifications however we do want people
 
05:42:47.948 --> 05:42:47.958 align:start position:0%
who know what they're doing in charge of
 
05:42:49.990 --> 05:42:50.000 align:start position:0%
our departments in general and I will
 
05:42:53.628 --> 05:42:53.638 align:start position:0%
point out in current RSA it says that
 
05:42:55.430 --> 05:42:55.440 align:start position:0%
all of the Commissioners will have five
 
05:42:57.548 --> 05:42:57.558 align:start position:0%
years experience in one or a combination
 
05:42:59.430 --> 05:42:59.440 align:start position:0%
of certain Fields with which may be
 
05:43:00.830 --> 05:43:00.840 align:start position:0%
demonstrated by the study at the
 
05:43:02.750 --> 05:43:02.760 align:start position:0%
undergraduate graduate level or
 
05:43:05.788 --> 05:43:05.798 align:start position:0%
employment so it already has a kind of
 
05:43:09.430 --> 05:43:09.440 align:start position:0%
education requirement already in current
 
05:43:11.628 --> 05:43:11.638 align:start position:0%
RSA thank you and you just explained how
 
05:43:15.310 --> 05:43:15.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:17.468 --> 05:43:17.478 align:start position:0%
um representative love I believe you had
 
05:43:19.310 --> 05:43:19.320 align:start position:0%
your hand up yes I did thank you Mr
 
05:43:22.910 --> 05:43:22.920 align:start position:0%
chair um I'm uh I'm opposed to this bill
 
05:43:26.788 --> 05:43:26.798 align:start position:0%
uh in its entirety um and uh pretty much
 
05:43:30.110 --> 05:43:30.120 align:start position:0%
the reason for it uh last year we had uh
 
05:43:32.750 --> 05:43:32.760 align:start position:0%
a bill I forget which one it was but uh
 
05:43:34.510 --> 05:43:34.520 align:start position:0%
there was a man from Massachusetts that
 
05:43:37.430 --> 05:43:37.440 align:start position:0%
came up and uh you know he was a a a
 
05:43:39.948 --> 05:43:39.958 align:start position:0%
trapping instructor and a licensed guide
 
05:43:42.110 --> 05:43:42.120 align:start position:0%
in seven states and you know had all
 
05:43:43.948 --> 05:43:43.958 align:start position:0%
kinds of outdoor credentials I guess you
 
05:43:46.430 --> 05:43:46.440 align:start position:0%
could call it and uh and he said you
 
05:43:48.628 --> 05:43:48.638 align:start position:0%
know what in New Hampshire you have the
 
05:43:50.948 --> 05:43:50.958 align:start position:0%
best bar none fishing game department in
 
05:43:53.590 --> 05:43:53.600 align:start position:0%
the country don't mess it up leave it
 
05:43:56.468 --> 05:43:56.478 align:start position:0%
alone okay um I think that's what we
 
05:43:59.948 --> 05:43:59.958 align:start position:0%
should be doing you know we I uh
 
05:44:02.510 --> 05:44:02.520 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire for 55 years I have
 
05:44:04.310 --> 05:44:04.320 align:start position:0%
never seen the deer herd in such a good
 
05:44:07.270 --> 05:44:07.280 align:start position:0%
in good shape okay I've never seen so
 
05:44:08.910 --> 05:44:08.920 align:start position:0%

and um you know I I if it ain't broke
 
05:44:33.628 --> 05:44:33.638 align:start position:0%

Howard thank you Mr chair um just going
 
05:46:03.230 --> 05:46:03.240 align:start position:0%
back to uh our Amendment um explain
 
05:46:03.240 --> 05:46:05.350 align:start position:0%
back to uh our Amendment um explain
reading

05:46:05.350 --> 05:46:05.360 align:start position:0%
reading
 
05:46:07.948 --> 05:46:07.958 align:start position:0%
Howard I would feel more comfortable
 
05:46:11.510 --> 05:46:11.520 align:start position:0%
under page three line nine where it says
 
05:46:13.948 --> 05:46:13.958 align:start position:0%
at least three of the four Commissioners
 
05:46:16.430 --> 05:46:16.440 align:start position:0%
I mean three of the 10 Commissioners
 
05:46:19.788 --> 05:46:19.798 align:start position:0%
appointed pursuant to paragraph 1A shall
 
05:46:21.830 --> 05:46:21.840 align:start position:0%
be qualified by
 
05:46:25.150 --> 05:46:25.160 align:start position:0%
holding can we strike sh and put
 
05:46:28.150 --> 05:46:28.160 align:start position:0%
May and that way there we're not looking
 
05:46:29.830 --> 05:46:29.840 align:start position:0%
for someone to meet a certain
 
05:46:32.350 --> 05:46:32.360 align:start position:0%
qualification to fill a position when we
 
05:46:34.548 --> 05:46:34.558 align:start position:0%
don't have anybody stepping up to the
 
05:46:37.628 --> 05:46:37.638 align:start position:0%
plate that be may not so under section c
 
05:46:41.150 --> 05:46:41.160 align:start position:0%
you're talking about yes yes where where
 
05:46:44.070 --> 05:46:44.080 align:start position:0%
it says shall we all know that shall has
 
05:46:53.030 --> 05:46:53.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:56.548 --> 05:46:56.558 align:start position:0%
will and that would go to Colonel
 
05:46:58.948 --> 05:46:58.958 align:start position:0%
Jordan's argument about you know four
 
05:47:01.788 --> 05:47:01.798 align:start position:0%
ing at least three members being signed
 
05:47:03.670 --> 05:47:03.680 align:start position:0%
well I guess the question is that that
 
05:47:05.468 --> 05:47:05.478 align:start position:0%
would leave no qualifications for three
 
05:47:07.270 --> 05:47:07.280 align:start position:0%
members when you put wh May in there but
 
05:47:08.990 --> 05:47:09.000 align:start position:0%
I could see if you wanted to change
 
05:47:12.468 --> 05:47:12.478 align:start position:0%
section c to say um up to three of the
 
05:47:14.270 --> 05:47:14.280 align:start position:0%
10 Commissioners and then that leaves
 
05:47:16.350 --> 05:47:16.360 align:start position:0%
some leeway if we only have if we don't
 
05:47:17.948 --> 05:47:17.958 align:start position:0%
have a scientist apply we already have
 
05:47:20.030 --> 05:47:20.040 align:start position:0%
one or we have none it doesn't matter we
 
05:47:21.708 --> 05:47:21.718 align:start position:0%
could but would allow at least up to
 
05:47:23.190 --> 05:47:23.200 align:start position:0%
three to be waved on the hunting
 
05:47:24.788 --> 05:47:24.798 align:start position:0%
requirements and be able to be seated if
 
05:47:26.670 --> 05:47:26.680 align:start position:0%
they're if they're a scientist yeah that
 
05:47:28.510 --> 05:47:28.520 align:start position:0%
makes more sense I you know I just I
 
05:47:29.990 --> 05:47:30.000 align:start position:0%
don't want to see us in a situation
 
05:47:31.990 --> 05:47:32.000 align:start position:0%
where we can't fill a position because
 
05:47:33.868 --> 05:47:33.878 align:start position:0%
we're not having someone who has that
 
05:47:35.990 --> 05:47:36.000 align:start position:0%
particular degree to step
 
05:47:36.000 --> 05:47:37.190 align:start position:0%
particular degree to step
up

05:47:37.190 --> 05:47:37.200 align:start position:0%
up
 
05:47:37.200 --> 05:47:39.390 align:start position:0%
up

SP thank you Mr chair since I had made
 
05:47:45.030 --> 05:47:45.040 align:start position:0%
that suggestion initially I would be in
 
05:47:46.990 --> 05:47:47.000 align:start position:0%
favor of saying up to three but that
 
05:47:48.948 --> 05:47:48.958 align:start position:0%
would also require a change in the seven
 
05:47:51.788 --> 05:47:51.798 align:start position:0%
out of 10 to say uh to remove the no
 
05:47:53.868 --> 05:47:53.878 align:start position:0%
more than seven and and say at least
 
05:47:57.230 --> 05:47:57.240 align:start position:0%
seven um because you would need to be
 
05:48:00.510 --> 05:48:00.520 align:start position:0%
able to fill the other unoccupied spaces
 
05:48:02.590 --> 05:48:02.600 align:start position:0%
if you couldn't find enough scientists
 
05:48:05.110 --> 05:48:05.120 align:start position:0%
with people who met the qualifications
 
05:48:08.430 --> 05:48:08.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:11.430 --> 05:48:11.440 align:start position:0%
licensing representative
 
05:48:15.390 --> 05:48:15.400 align:start position:0%
Craig the language problem with changing
 
05:48:17.030 --> 05:48:17.040 align:start position:0%
it to up to
 
05:48:20.628 --> 05:48:20.638 align:start position:0%
three uh would be that I understand the
 
05:48:22.510 --> 05:48:22.520 align:start position:0%
logic instead of requiring that three of
 
05:48:26.670 --> 05:48:26.680 align:start position:0%
them uh be qualified by education and uh
 
05:48:29.948 --> 05:48:29.958 align:start position:0%
experience but if you say up to three if
 
05:48:32.628 --> 05:48:32.638 align:start position:0%
you've got your three scientists filled
 
05:48:33.830 --> 05:48:33.840 align:start position:0%
and you're looking to fill another
 
05:48:37.670 --> 05:48:37.680 align:start position:0%
commissioner slot or if a longstanding
 
05:48:40.510 --> 05:48:40.520 align:start position:0%
commissioner happens to meet those
 
05:48:44.150 --> 05:48:44.160 align:start position:0%
qualifications somebody's got to
 
05:48:47.468 --> 05:48:47.478 align:start position:0%
go so if I guess the way I would read
 
05:48:48.830 --> 05:48:48.840 align:start position:0%
that is that I've already met the
 
05:48:50.468 --> 05:48:50.478 align:start position:0%
qualification under the hunter provision
 
05:48:52.948 --> 05:48:52.958 align:start position:0%
I can be a hunter plus a scientist and
 
05:48:55.910 --> 05:48:55.920 align:start position:0%
so you could do either or or both so you
 
05:48:57.948 --> 05:48:57.958 align:start position:0%
would you would fit it either way so you
 
05:48:59.350 --> 05:48:59.360 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have to just because you're a
 
05:49:01.230 --> 05:49:01.240 align:start position:0%
scientist and a hunter doesn't mean and
 
05:49:02.788 --> 05:49:02.798 align:start position:0%
we had three scientists you can't have a
 
05:49:04.670 --> 05:49:04.680 align:start position:0%
fourth scientist that's also a hunter
 
05:49:06.350 --> 05:49:06.360 align:start position:0%
and meets all the other
 
05:49:08.150 --> 05:49:08.160 align:start position:0%
Provisions I don't know if anybody else
 
05:49:10.230 --> 05:49:10.240 align:start position:0%
feels that that's the way I read it the
 
05:49:14.110 --> 05:49:14.120 align:start position:0%
way Mr chair read yes um and I was just
 
05:49:16.628 --> 05:49:16.638 align:start position:0%
explaining this to my neighbor here um
 
05:49:19.548 --> 05:49:19.558 align:start position:0%
so the at least language is intentional
 
05:49:21.788 --> 05:49:21.798 align:start position:0%
to allow that kind of overlap so you
 
05:49:24.510 --> 05:49:24.520 align:start position:0%
have at least three three scientists if
 
05:49:26.070 --> 05:49:26.080 align:start position:0%
you want more scientists they also
 
05:49:28.230 --> 05:49:28.240 align:start position:0%
happen to be have to be Hunters but it
 
05:49:30.510 --> 05:49:30.520 align:start position:0%
allows you to to have that overlap if
 
05:49:34.150 --> 05:49:34.160 align:start position:0%
you say no more than or up to then you
 
05:49:36.310 --> 05:49:36.320 align:start position:0%
run into the problem that representative
 
05:49:39.468 --> 05:49:39.478 align:start position:0%
Craig uh pointed out but also you may
 
05:49:41.628 --> 05:49:41.638 align:start position:0%
have a situation how do they qualify if
 
05:49:45.270 --> 05:49:45.280 align:start position:0%
they if you say up to how would they
 
05:49:47.948 --> 05:49:47.958 align:start position:0%
qualify if they're if if if you're
 
05:49:51.070 --> 05:49:51.080 align:start position:0%
saying they they may they may be a
 
05:49:54.590 --> 05:49:54.600 align:start position:0%
scientist so they don't have to be no
 
05:49:55.830 --> 05:49:55.840 align:start position:0%
yeah I think I think we still leave the
 
05:49:58.708 --> 05:49:58.718 align:start position:0%
shall in there the question is that is a
 
05:50:02.310 --> 05:50:02.320 align:start position:0%
hard three or one two or three so the
 
05:50:05.670 --> 05:50:05.680 align:start position:0%
the um the hunters the seven Hunters are
 
05:50:07.948 --> 05:50:07.958 align:start position:0%
also at least and by doing at least
 
05:50:10.910 --> 05:50:10.920 align:start position:0%
seven and at least three that means that
 
05:50:12.350 --> 05:50:12.360 align:start position:0%
in either direction you could end up
 
05:50:14.230 --> 05:50:14.240 align:start position:0%
with a commission of 11 Hunters who are
 
05:50:18.830 --> 05:50:18.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:21.548 --> 05:50:21.558 align:start position:0%
saying representative love could we
 
05:50:24.030 --> 05:50:24.040 align:start position:0%
amend that to uh something on the idea
 
05:50:28.190 --> 05:50:28.200 align:start position:0%
of uh if no one uh steps forth steps
 
05:50:30.590 --> 05:50:30.600 align:start position:0%
forward to uh to fill the seat you know
 
05:50:32.990 --> 05:50:33.000 align:start position:0%
under these qualifications it reverts
 
05:50:35.030 --> 05:50:35.040 align:start position:0%
back to the the
 
05:50:37.070 --> 05:50:37.080 align:start position:0%
hunter you know that way we don't have
 
05:50:38.990 --> 05:50:39.000 align:start position:0%
empty seats uh you know you give them
 
05:50:40.548 --> 05:50:40.558 align:start position:0%
two or three months to to leave the
 
05:50:40.558 --> 05:50:41.788 align:start position:0%
two or three months to to leave the
position

05:50:41.788 --> 05:50:41.798 align:start position:0%
position
 
05:50:43.948 --> 05:50:43.958 align:start position:0%
open represent
 
05:50:47.510 --> 05:50:47.520 align:start position:0%
Spain so are you suggesting we we add a
 
05:50:51.390 --> 05:50:51.400 align:start position:0%
um no suitable candidate provision
 
05:50:57.350 --> 05:50:57.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:57.360 --> 05:50:59.190 align:start position:0%
 
here

05:50:59.190 --> 05:50:59.200 align:start position:0%
here
 
05:51:01.430 --> 05:51:01.440 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to find what language there
 
05:51:02.788 --> 05:51:02.798 align:start position:0%
it is at least seven of attorney
 
05:51:06.030 --> 05:51:06.040 align:start position:0%
commission sh um representative Harvey
 
05:51:09.590 --> 05:51:09.600 align:start position:0%
go ahead um so I'm confused if if it's
 
05:51:13.070 --> 05:51:13.080 align:start position:0%
saying at least three then why would you
 
05:51:15.990 --> 05:51:16.000 align:start position:0%
have to have a no suitable candidate
 
05:51:16.000 --> 05:51:18.548 align:start position:0%
have to have a no suitable candidate
line

05:51:18.548 --> 05:51:18.558 align:start position:0%
line
 
05:51:21.868 --> 05:51:21.878 align:start position:0%
um I believe the the problem that's
 
05:51:25.390 --> 05:51:25.400 align:start position:0%
being proposed is the case where for a
 
05:51:28.350 --> 05:51:28.360 align:start position:0%
given County there may not be a cand
 
05:51:29.948 --> 05:51:29.958 align:start position:0%
candate who
 
05:51:33.628 --> 05:51:33.638 align:start position:0%
qualifies who is willing to do the job
 
05:51:36.390 --> 05:51:36.400 align:start position:0%
or be nominated right right I understand
 
05:51:39.350 --> 05:51:39.360 align:start position:0%
that but there's nothing in in here that
 
05:51:41.708 --> 05:51:41.718 align:start position:0%
is talking about which county that
 
05:51:44.390 --> 05:51:44.400 align:start position:0%
scientist is going to no that was that
 
05:51:46.948 --> 05:51:46.958 align:start position:0%
was what Kevin uh Colonel Jordan was
 
05:51:48.230 --> 05:51:48.240 align:start position:0%
saying you know how do we decide where
 
05:51:51.230 --> 05:51:51.240 align:start position:0%
it goes so they can be from any County
 
05:51:53.868 --> 05:51:53.878 align:start position:0%
but when a position comes up it's for
 
05:51:56.070 --> 05:51:56.080 align:start position:0%
one County so as the governor has to
 
05:51:58.030 --> 05:51:58.040 align:start position:0%
fill a county a position it is always
 
05:52:02.548 --> 05:52:02.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:05.548 --> 05:52:05.558 align:start position:0%
County so as much as I love to say this
 
05:52:07.070 --> 05:52:07.080 align:start position:0%
because I hate kicking the can down the
 
05:52:08.990 --> 05:52:09.000 align:start position:0%
road for anybody with the amount of
 
05:52:10.788 --> 05:52:10.798 align:start position:0%
discussion we're having about amendments
 
05:52:12.150 --> 05:52:12.160 align:start position:0%
proposals and
 
05:52:14.708 --> 05:52:14.718 align:start position:0%
changes I'm wondering whether retain is
 
05:52:16.270 --> 05:52:16.280 align:start position:0%
the appropriate motion to hold this so
 
05:52:19.070 --> 05:52:19.080 align:start position:0%
we can fix the Amendments that we want
 
05:52:21.190 --> 05:52:21.200 align:start position:0%
um and we can bring it up later the
 
05:52:23.548 --> 05:52:23.558 align:start position:0%
other option is we pass it as it is and
 
05:52:25.110 --> 05:52:25.120 align:start position:0%
we hope the Senate jumps on board and
 
05:52:26.830 --> 05:52:26.840 align:start position:0%
does the changes we want which is never
 
05:52:30.270 --> 05:52:30.280 align:start position:0%
a sure thing so um representative close
 
05:52:31.310 --> 05:52:31.320 align:start position:0%
you looks like you have that look on
 
05:52:34.110 --> 05:52:34.120 align:start position:0%
your face you really want to say
 
05:52:37.030 --> 05:52:37.040 align:start position:0%
something yes sir I'd like to have the
 
05:52:38.590 --> 05:52:38.600 align:start position:0%
major come up just for a minute I the
 
05:52:41.628 --> 05:52:41.638 align:start position:0%
colonel I'm sorry I keep C to Major you
 
05:52:43.230 --> 05:52:43.240 align:start position:0%
can call a major after what he just said
 
05:52:47.070 --> 05:52:47.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:47.080 --> 05:52:49.230 align:start position:0%
 
fine

05:52:49.230 --> 05:52:49.240 align:start position:0%
fine
 
05:52:52.708 --> 05:52:52.718 align:start position:0%
yeah I got just one question for you now
 
05:52:54.430 --> 05:52:54.440 align:start position:0%
I I don't know how many years experience
 
05:52:56.548 --> 05:52:56.558 align:start position:0%
you have I buy the hatch marks it looks
 
05:52:58.708 --> 05:52:58.718 align:start position:0%
like 30
 
05:53:01.070 --> 05:53:01.080 align:start position:0%
have you ever
 
05:53:04.270 --> 05:53:04.280 align:start position:0%
ever had trouble with the commissioners
 
05:53:08.390 --> 05:53:08.400 align:start position:0%
of fishing game just agreements yes yes
 
05:53:09.670 --> 05:53:09.680 align:start position:0%
but that's what's supposed to happen
 
05:53:12.548 --> 05:53:12.558 align:start position:0%
just correct like this one disagreements
 
05:53:14.030 --> 05:53:14.040 align:start position:0%
where I when I've been able to come in
 
05:53:16.830 --> 05:53:16.840 align:start position:0%
here and convince you to go in a
 
05:53:18.628 --> 05:53:18.638 align:start position:0%
direction that we want and then
 
05:53:21.468 --> 05:53:21.478 align:start position:0%
disagreed and go out accept we've had
 
05:53:23.910 --> 05:53:23.920 align:start position:0%
that with the commission thank you
 
05:53:27.150 --> 05:53:27.160 align:start position:0%
typically I personal experience I've had
 
05:53:27.160 --> 05:53:29.110 align:start position:0%
typically I personal experience I've had
excellent

05:53:29.110 --> 05:53:29.120 align:start position:0%
excellent
 
05:53:32.628 --> 05:53:32.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:36.350 --> 05:53:36.360 align:start position:0%
you and everybody I'm sure has read all
 
05:53:38.910 --> 05:53:38.920 align:start position:0%
about Commissioners in the book about
 
05:53:42.270 --> 05:53:42.280 align:start position:0%
three pages I'm sure we're all up on
 
05:53:46.350 --> 05:53:46.360 align:start position:0%
that I just want to say one thing that
 
05:53:49.150 --> 05:53:49.160 align:start position:0%
no reflection on Mrs Harvey she's done a
 
05:53:51.548 --> 05:53:51.558 align:start position:0%
lot of work on this bill but I don't see
 
05:53:54.190 --> 05:53:54.200 align:start position:0%
this bill at all I've been protecting
 
05:53:58.230 --> 05:53:58.240 align:start position:0%
the Fish and Game Commission since 1989
 
05:53:59.948 --> 05:53:59.958 align:start position:0%
we first had the first bill when I was
 
05:54:03.030 --> 05:54:03.040 align:start position:0%
in the house on the commission and by
 
05:54:05.708 --> 05:54:05.718 align:start position:0%
God it's the same thing people were
 
05:54:07.990 --> 05:54:08.000 align:start position:0%
arguing back and forth back and forth
 
05:54:11.070 --> 05:54:11.080 align:start position:0%
and we got no place about it and that's
 
05:54:14.150 --> 05:54:14.160 align:start position:0%
how it's been and I I've tended nine
 
05:54:16.510 --> 05:54:16.520 align:start position:0%
years of it and it's been the same thing
 
05:54:19.270 --> 05:54:19.280 align:start position:0%
change a commission change a commission
 
05:54:21.628 --> 05:54:21.638 align:start position:0%
these men in the commission they give
 
05:54:26.110 --> 05:54:26.120 align:start position:0%
their time up every week to come in and
 
05:54:28.310 --> 05:54:28.320 align:start position:0%
do what business they have to do they
 
05:54:30.708 --> 05:54:30.718 align:start position:0%
don't get paid for it and they get a lot
 
05:54:33.548 --> 05:54:33.558 align:start position:0%
of criticism from all these so-called
 
05:54:36.150 --> 05:54:36.160 align:start position:0%
experts in the state of New Hampshire
 
05:54:37.670 --> 05:54:37.680 align:start position:0%
and I've been with a lot of them and
 
05:54:40.150 --> 05:54:40.160 align:start position:0%
they're a bunch of beauties I don't
 
05:54:42.150 --> 05:54:42.160 align:start position:0%
think that fishing game Commissioners
 
05:54:44.468 --> 05:54:44.478 align:start position:0%
should take any slack from anybody
 
05:54:46.750 --> 05:54:46.760 align:start position:0%
they've done a great job they keep us
 
05:54:49.910 --> 05:54:49.920 align:start position:0%
out of trouble the department looks good
 
05:54:51.830 --> 05:54:51.840 align:start position:0%
we haven't had no trouble with the law
 
05:54:54.270 --> 05:54:54.280 align:start position:0%
enforcement department everybody's been
 
05:54:56.270 --> 05:54:56.280 align:start position:0%
good and just look at our herds look at
 
05:54:58.110 --> 05:54:58.120 align:start position:0%
our stock look at our turkey look at our
 
05:55:00.990 --> 05:55:01.000 align:start position:0%
idea everything's really good in the
 
05:55:03.150 --> 05:55:03.160 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire so when I hear
 
05:55:04.910 --> 05:55:04.920 align:start position:0%
people talk and they want to do this and
 
05:55:06.990 --> 05:55:07.000 align:start position:0%
they want to put a scientist in and then
 
05:55:09.030 --> 05:55:09.040 align:start position:0%
they go to the page three and they want
 
05:55:11.468 --> 05:55:11.478 align:start position:0%
a conation you know
 
05:55:13.750 --> 05:55:13.760 align:start position:0%
controversion that belongs I need the F
 
05:55:15.350 --> 05:55:15.360 align:start position:0%
Department not the fish and game
 
05:55:18.030 --> 05:55:18.040 align:start position:0%
department and our department is Fish
 
05:55:21.708 --> 05:55:21.718 align:start position:0%
and Game very very simple words and
 
05:55:23.390 --> 05:55:23.400 align:start position:0%
that's what we should be sticking to
 
05:55:26.468 --> 05:55:26.478 align:start position:0%
fish and game thank you very much Mr
 
05:55:30.110 --> 05:55:30.120 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you representative
 
05:55:33.310 --> 05:55:33.320 align:start position:0%
Reed thank you so there's something
 
05:55:35.430 --> 05:55:35.440 align:start position:0%
called Survivor bias probably most of
 
05:55:37.190 --> 05:55:37.200 align:start position:0%
you familiar with it as an example I
 
05:55:38.788 --> 05:55:38.798 align:start position:0%
just read this story literally two days
 
05:55:41.548 --> 05:55:41.558 align:start position:0%
ago uh after World War II or maybe
 
05:55:43.830 --> 05:55:43.840 align:start position:0%
during World War II Allied planes would
 
05:55:45.310 --> 05:55:45.320 align:start position:0%
come back with a bunch of bullet holes
 
05:55:46.990 --> 05:55:47.000 align:start position:0%
in different parts and they measured
 
05:55:49.070 --> 05:55:49.080 align:start position:0%
exactly what parts of the planes
 
05:55:52.030 --> 05:55:52.040 align:start position:0%
actually had the most bullet holes and
 
05:55:53.548 --> 05:55:53.558 align:start position:0%
they their immediate response was well
 
05:55:55.230 --> 05:55:55.240 align:start position:0%
that's the the plane that we need to
 
05:55:58.070 --> 05:55:58.080 align:start position:0%
actually put more uh armor on because
 
05:55:59.150 --> 05:55:59.160 align:start position:0%
that's where their bullet holes are
 
05:56:00.628 --> 05:56:00.638 align:start position:0%
getting and it was actually a
 
05:56:03.030 --> 05:56:03.040 align:start position:0%
mathematician that came and said no
 
05:56:04.750 --> 05:56:04.760 align:start position:0%
these are the planes that are returning
 
05:56:06.110 --> 05:56:06.120 align:start position:0%
these are the planes that came back
 
05:56:08.190 --> 05:56:08.200 align:start position:0%
these are not the planes that crashed so
 
05:56:09.548 --> 05:56:09.558 align:start position:0%
this means that these are are the parts
 
05:56:11.270 --> 05:56:11.280 align:start position:0%
of the plane that it's okay that they
 
05:56:13.150 --> 05:56:13.160 align:start position:0%
they're taking damage on so that's
 
05:56:16.830 --> 05:56:16.840 align:start position:0%
Survivor buas the fact that Hunters Avid
 
05:56:19.390 --> 05:56:19.400 align:start position:0%
Hunters who you know I can say nothing
 
05:56:21.270 --> 05:56:21.280 align:start position:0%
bad of they they want to have
 
05:56:22.990 --> 05:56:23.000 align:start position:0%
conservation in the state they want to
 
05:56:24.910 --> 05:56:24.920 align:start position:0%
have good uh hunting opportunities in
 
05:56:26.990 --> 05:56:27.000 align:start position:0%
the state the fact that they are
 
05:56:28.110 --> 05:56:28.120 align:start position:0%
benefiting from the current current
 
05:56:31.310 --> 05:56:31.320 align:start position:0%
makeup is great but the people who are
 
05:56:33.310 --> 05:56:33.320 align:start position:0%
not benefiting from the current makeup
 
05:56:36.628 --> 05:56:36.638 align:start position:0%
are the ones that are being left out and
 
05:56:39.110 --> 05:56:39.120 align:start position:0%
I have to to say we have no further to
 
05:56:41.350 --> 05:56:41.360 align:start position:0%
look than the fact that you have heard
 
05:56:42.350 --> 05:56:42.360 align:start position:0%
that there's a problem with the
 
05:56:43.830 --> 05:56:43.840 align:start position:0%
commission for every single one of those
 
05:56:47.070 --> 05:56:47.080 align:start position:0%
years since 1980 whatever it was right
 
05:56:48.708 --> 05:56:48.718 align:start position:0%
the fact that this bill has come up in
 
05:56:50.708 --> 05:56:50.718 align:start position:0%
some form or another eight different
 
05:56:52.910 --> 05:56:52.920 align:start position:0%
times there are people who are feeling
 
05:56:56.390 --> 05:56:56.400 align:start position:0%
left out and to say that oh it works
 
05:56:59.150 --> 05:56:59.160 align:start position:0%
great for us because our people are the
 
05:57:00.510 --> 05:57:00.520 align:start position:0%
ones in charge and they're the only ones
 
05:57:02.590 --> 05:57:02.600 align:start position:0%
in charge doesn't mean that there's not
 
05:57:04.510 --> 05:57:04.520 align:start position:0%
a problem and I will also say that there
 
05:57:05.830 --> 05:57:05.840 align:start position:0%
are a lot of other states that have
 
05:57:07.628 --> 05:57:07.638 align:start position:0%
really great hunting opportunities who
 
05:57:10.310 --> 05:57:10.320 align:start position:0%
do things differently that do diversify
 
05:57:11.948 --> 05:57:11.958 align:start position:0%
their commission put scientists on their
 
05:57:14.708 --> 05:57:14.718 align:start position:0%
commission States like Texas and
 
05:57:17.150 --> 05:57:17.160 align:start position:0%
Colorado and Montana they have excellent
 
05:57:19.270 --> 05:57:19.280 align:start position:0%
hunting opportunities as well but they
 
05:57:22.750 --> 05:57:22.760 align:start position:0%
do put other people on that commission
 
05:57:24.830 --> 05:57:24.840 align:start position:0%
so I just want to encourage us to not
 
05:57:26.788 --> 05:57:26.798 align:start position:0%
fall into the Trap of Survivor
 
05:57:30.510 --> 05:57:30.520 align:start position:0%
bias representative Harvey mostly I want
 
05:57:32.030 --> 05:57:32.040 align:start position:0%
to say to representative close that I
 
05:57:34.990 --> 05:57:35.000 align:start position:0%
take no offense to anything you say we
 
05:57:36.628 --> 05:57:36.638 align:start position:0%
we've been friends for a couple years
 
05:57:38.110 --> 05:57:38.120 align:start position:0%
and I hope we'll go on being friends so
 
05:57:39.350 --> 05:57:39.360 align:start position:0%
you go ahead and say whatever you want
 
05:57:41.628 --> 05:57:41.638 align:start position:0%
to say I'm okay with it but I would like
 
05:57:44.190 --> 05:57:44.200 align:start position:0%
to point out um yes I have read these
 
05:57:46.150 --> 05:57:46.160 align:start position:0%
three pages so many times I think I have
 
05:57:47.868 --> 05:57:47.878 align:start position:0%
them memorized and I can say it in my
 
05:57:49.708 --> 05:57:49.718 align:start position:0%
sleep so I would like to point out
 
05:57:49.718 --> 05:57:50.788 align:start position:0%
sleep so I would like to point out
though

05:57:50.788 --> 05:57:50.798 align:start position:0%
though
 
05:57:53.350 --> 05:57:53.360 align:start position:0%
um when you say it's our their
 
05:57:55.750 --> 05:57:55.760 align:start position:0%
responsibility is fish and game if you
 
05:57:59.030 --> 05:57:59.040 align:start position:0%
look under the duties of uh commissioner
 
05:58:02.310 --> 05:58:02.320 align:start position:0%
and that and number one number one top
 
05:58:04.548 --> 05:58:04.558 align:start position:0%
of page 25 in my green book I don't know
 
05:58:06.910 --> 05:58:06.920 align:start position:0%
what color you have but the first word
 
05:58:09.110 --> 05:58:09.120 align:start position:0%
that comes as a duty of the commi
 
05:58:10.910 --> 05:58:10.920 align:start position:0%
Commissioners is
 
05:58:13.230 --> 05:58:13.240 align:start position:0%
conservation not fish and game it's
 
05:58:16.270 --> 05:58:16.280 align:start position:0%
conservation and the second word is
 
05:58:20.830 --> 05:58:20.840 align:start position:0%
protection um so so it it you know
 
05:58:23.430 --> 05:58:23.440 align:start position:0%
although we're still friends I I do
 
05:58:25.390 --> 05:58:25.400 align:start position:0%
disagree that it is just fishing game
 
05:58:27.150 --> 05:58:27.160 align:start position:0%
it's it the the words right there are
 
05:58:27.160 --> 05:58:29.548 align:start position:0%
it's it the the words right there are
conservation

05:58:29.548 --> 05:58:29.558 align:start position:0%
conservation
 
05:58:33.390 --> 05:58:33.400 align:start position:0%
protection close you want to respond yes
 
05:58:35.230 --> 05:58:35.240 align:start position:0%
uh that was brought out at the last
 
05:58:37.190 --> 05:58:37.200 align:start position:0%
hearing from the the new director we
 
05:58:39.708 --> 05:58:39.718 align:start position:0%
have and the word conservation showed up
 
05:58:42.910 --> 05:58:42.920 align:start position:0%
several times the director of The Farm
 
05:58:45.868 --> 05:58:45.878 align:start position:0%
Bureau suggested that if fishing game
 
05:58:47.670 --> 05:58:47.680 align:start position:0%
wanted to talk about conservation they
 
05:58:49.830 --> 05:58:49.840 align:start position:0%
should come to the F Bureau that's where
 
05:58:52.190 --> 05:58:52.200 align:start position:0%
that falls under not fishing game that
 
05:58:53.670 --> 05:58:53.680 align:start position:0%
was right from the director or the
 
05:58:55.430 --> 05:58:55.440 align:start position:0%
commissioner that was right from the
 
05:58:56.990 --> 05:58:57.000 align:start position:0%
commissioner that's where I get that
 
05:58:59.670 --> 05:58:59.680 align:start position:0%
from thank
 
05:59:03.030 --> 05:59:03.040 align:start position:0%
you does anybody else have anything to
 
05:59:06.350 --> 05:59:06.360 align:start position:0%
say okay so the one thing I I'll say
 
05:59:09.350 --> 05:59:09.360 align:start position:0%
because I get the microphone is that um
 
05:59:11.708 --> 05:59:11.718 align:start position:0%
I sat on a three-hour meeting with
 
05:59:13.750 --> 05:59:13.760 align:start position:0%
representative Harvey with the
 
05:59:16.830 --> 05:59:16.840 align:start position:0%
Commissioners discussing this very Bill
 
05:59:18.868 --> 05:59:18.878 align:start position:0%
and it seemed to me that again the
 
05:59:21.390 --> 05:59:21.400 align:start position:0%
Commissioners were open and and
 
05:59:22.708 --> 05:59:22.718 align:start position:0%
accepting the fact that the statute
 
05:59:24.590 --> 05:59:24.600 align:start position:0%
needs updating and it's why they're
 
05:59:26.310 --> 05:59:26.320 align:start position:0%
willing to work with trying to get an
 
05:59:27.948 --> 05:59:27.958 align:start position:0%
amendment out to get an amendment that
 
05:59:29.708 --> 05:59:29.718 align:start position:0%
fit what their requirements were what
 
05:59:33.468 --> 05:59:33.478 align:start position:0%
they felt their needs were um and given
 
05:59:35.270 --> 05:59:35.280 align:start position:0%
the conversation again of the back and
 
05:59:38.510 --> 05:59:38.520 align:start position:0%
forth around the amendment um and and I
 
05:59:41.510 --> 05:59:41.520 align:start position:0%
think there's there's a majority support
 
05:59:43.190 --> 05:59:43.200 align:start position:0%
for the bill but I think there's still
 
05:59:44.868 --> 05:59:44.878 align:start position:0%
some questions around the amendment from
 
05:59:47.110 --> 05:59:47.120 align:start position:0%
the discussion we've been listening to
 
05:59:49.670 --> 05:59:49.680 align:start position:0%
so um I I I would think that again the
 
05:59:51.270 --> 05:59:51.280 align:start position:0%
smart move would be to retain this bill
 
05:59:53.750 --> 05:59:53.760 align:start position:0%
to work on the amendment to fit the
 
05:59:56.670 --> 05:59:56.680 align:start position:0%
couple needs we had around you know up
 
05:59:58.230 --> 05:59:58.240 align:start position:0%
to versus
 
06:00:02.430 --> 06:00:02.440 align:start position:0%
um uh minimum requirement at least three
 
06:00:04.830 --> 06:00:04.840 align:start position:0%
uh there was an Andor conversation uh
 
06:00:06.910 --> 06:00:06.920 align:start position:0%
that came out as part of the discussion
 
06:00:10.510 --> 06:00:10.520 align:start position:0%
in uh of the bill itself during the time
 
06:00:11.868 --> 06:00:11.878 align:start position:0%
um so I think probably your retain
 
06:00:13.830 --> 06:00:13.840 align:start position:0%
Motion makes sense going forward for
 
06:00:15.628 --> 06:00:15.638 align:start position:0%
this committee to give us a a mechanism
 
06:00:17.150 --> 06:00:17.160 align:start position:0%
to allow us to get the commission to
 
06:00:18.868 --> 06:00:18.878 align:start position:0%
weigh in and work with us to develop
 
06:00:21.390 --> 06:00:21.400 align:start position:0%
amendment that they feel works for them
 
06:00:23.468 --> 06:00:23.478 align:start position:0%
um I to also looked at the fishing game
 
06:00:25.230 --> 06:00:25.240 align:start position:0%
website and the first word in their
 
06:00:27.190 --> 06:00:27.200 align:start position:0%
mission statement is conserve then
 
06:00:30.430 --> 06:00:30.440 align:start position:0%
manage manage then protect sorry Colonel
 
06:00:32.990 --> 06:00:33.000 align:start position:0%
um but uh but the first two has to do
 
06:00:35.270 --> 06:00:35.280 align:start position:0%
with managing and and conserving our
 
06:00:36.788 --> 06:00:36.798 align:start position:0%
resources and when you talk about the
 
06:00:39.670 --> 06:00:39.680 align:start position:0%
fish end game there's three more words
 
06:00:41.110 --> 06:00:41.120 align:start position:0%
that go with that committee and that is
 
06:00:44.070 --> 06:00:44.080 align:start position:0%
endm Marine Resources and it's about the
 
06:00:46.070 --> 06:00:46.080 align:start position:0%
resources not fishing game it's about
 
06:00:48.430 --> 06:00:48.440 align:start position:0%
managing the fish the game and Marine
 
06:00:50.510 --> 06:00:50.520 align:start position:0%
Resources and I think that it's not
 
06:00:52.910 --> 06:00:52.920 align:start position:0%
unreasonable to say we want some decent
 
06:00:54.750 --> 06:00:54.760 align:start position:0%
people setting policy for us that have
 
06:00:56.390 --> 06:00:56.400 align:start position:0%
experience in the background so I think
 
06:00:58.190 --> 06:00:58.200 align:start position:0%
that's also what the commission is
 
06:01:00.910 --> 06:01:00.920 align:start position:0%
getting to as well so that being said
 
06:01:02.390 --> 06:01:02.400 align:start position:0%
unless there's anything further we want
 
06:01:04.628 --> 06:01:04.638 align:start position:0%
to discuss we can start moving into
 
06:01:04.638 --> 06:01:06.430 align:start position:0%
to discuss we can start moving into
executive

06:01:06.430 --> 06:01:06.440 align:start position:0%
executive
 
06:01:08.310 --> 06:01:08.320 align:start position:0%
session so I'll open it up for
 
06:01:11.030 --> 06:01:11.040 align:start position:0%
discussion on all
 
06:01:14.590 --> 06:01:14.600 align:start position:0%
bills they're being done I will
 
06:01:17.628 --> 06:01:17.638 align:start position:0%
represent wolf go ahead just a question
 
06:01:20.270 --> 06:01:20.280 align:start position:0%
a point of order I if you take these
 
06:01:22.910 --> 06:01:22.920 align:start position:0%
bills in the order that we've discussed
 
06:01:25.670 --> 06:01:25.680 align:start position:0%
them 529 and
 
06:01:28.510 --> 06:01:28.520 align:start position:0%
192 and uh
 
06:01:31.270 --> 06:01:31.280 align:start position:0%
342 and 342 was the one that was going
 
06:01:35.190 --> 06:01:35.200 align:start position:0%
to get referred to a second
 
06:01:36.910 --> 06:01:36.920 align:start position:0%
committee that was the one I was going
 
06:01:38.910 --> 06:01:38.920 align:start position:0%
to ask I'll make a recommendation to the
 
06:01:41.788 --> 06:01:41.798 align:start position:0%
leadership that 342 be referred to the
 
06:01:43.788 --> 06:01:43.798 align:start position:0%
municipal and County government would
 
06:01:45.708 --> 06:01:45.718 align:start position:0%
you then leave it up to the second
 
06:01:48.830 --> 06:01:48.840 align:start position:0%
committee to pass it or would we would
 
06:01:50.788 --> 06:01:50.798 align:start position:0%
we pass it so we have to pass it move it
 
06:01:52.990 --> 06:01:53.000 align:start position:0%
as a policy we agree on a fish and game
 
06:01:55.830 --> 06:01:55.840 align:start position:0%
policy this works um and then they would
 
06:01:57.708 --> 06:01:57.718 align:start position:0%
decide whether on a municipal policy it
 
06:01:59.708 --> 06:01:59.718 align:start position:0%
would work for them thank you but my
 
06:02:02.548 --> 06:02:02.558 align:start position:0%
question then comes if they decide that
 
06:02:04.350 --> 06:02:04.360 align:start position:0%
they don't want it as a policy that they
 
06:02:05.548 --> 06:02:05.558 align:start position:0%
shoot it
 
06:02:07.788 --> 06:02:07.798 align:start position:0%
down then you've
 
06:02:07.798 --> 06:02:10.350 align:start position:0%
down then you've
got

06:02:10.350 --> 06:02:10.360 align:start position:0%
got
 
06:02:14.430 --> 06:02:14.440 align:start position:0%

06:02:17.990 --> 06:02:18.000 align:start position:0%

06:02:25.430 --> 06:02:25.440 align:start position:0%

to catch up from the last one hold on
 
06:16:21.628 --> 06:16:21.638 align:start position:0%
boy actually I have a
 
06:16:24.670 --> 06:16:24.680 align:start position:0%
question sure go ahead since we pulled
 
06:16:26.628 --> 06:16:26.638 align:start position:0%
an amendment already that C it in the
 
06:16:28.590 --> 06:16:28.600 align:start position:0%
same calendar day should we apply the
 
06:16:30.910 --> 06:16:30.920 align:start position:0%
amendment while before we retain and
 
06:16:32.750 --> 06:16:32.760 align:start position:0%
then retain the amended version to work
 
06:16:34.990 --> 06:16:35.000 align:start position:0%
on or should we just retain that bill
 
06:16:36.990 --> 06:16:37.000 align:start position:0%
and then have to reapply another
 
06:16:40.190 --> 06:16:40.200 align:start position:0%
amendment later there's no such thing as
 
06:16:42.390 --> 06:16:42.400 align:start position:0%
amending and retain the bill you retain
 
06:16:43.590 --> 06:16:43.600 align:start position:0%
it and then move it forward and then you
 
06:16:45.230 --> 06:16:45.240 align:start position:0%
can amend it when you actually go to
 
06:16:47.270 --> 06:16:47.280 align:start position:0%
adjudicate yeah my question was whether
 
06:16:49.270 --> 06:16:49.280 align:start position:0%
we should do an OTP put the amendment on
 
06:16:53.270 --> 06:16:53.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:16:56.390 --> 06:16:56.400 align:start position:0%
otpa no I that's improper procedure
 
06:16:57.990 --> 06:16:58.000 align:start position:0%
because you would be you have to vote
 
06:16:59.548 --> 06:16:59.558 align:start position:0%
down the OTP motion because that's the
 
06:17:01.030 --> 06:17:01.040 align:start position:0%
motion that's
 
06:17:01.040 --> 06:17:04.948 align:start position:0%
motion that's
prevalent

06:17:04.948 --> 06:17:04.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:17:07.030 --> 06:17:07.040 align:start position:0%
yeah I think the proper motion is to
 
06:17:10.628 --> 06:17:10.638 align:start position:0%
retain we can correct so representative
 
06:17:14.310 --> 06:17:14.320 align:start position:0%

procedural thing
 
06:23:46.110 --> 06:23:46.120 align:start position:0%
um I don't think retained bills have to
 
06:23:48.070 --> 06:23:48.080 align:start position:0%
go on the calendar at
 
06:23:52.070 --> 06:23:52.080 align:start position:0%
all that's correct retain bills by us
 
06:23:55.430 --> 06:23:55.440 align:start position:0%
yeah so as far as being on consent that
 
06:23:56.750 --> 06:23:56.760 align:start position:0%
don't have
 
06:23:58.948 --> 06:23:58.958 align:start position:0%
to um
 
06:24:02.948 --> 06:24:02.958 align:start position:0%
