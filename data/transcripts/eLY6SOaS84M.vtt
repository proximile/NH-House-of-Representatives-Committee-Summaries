00:12:55.470 --> 00:12:55.480 align:start position:0%
all right um it's uh just about 9:15 I'm
 
00:12:58.430 --> 00:12:58.440 align:start position:0%
going to call the uh Judiciary Committee
 
00:13:00.310 --> 00:13:00.320 align:start position:0%
uh executive session to order and I'm
 
00:13:01.790 --> 00:13:01.800 align:start position:0%
first going to recognize representative
 
00:13:07.350 --> 00:13:07.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:10.150 --> 00:13:10.160 align:start position:0%
allegiance to the flag of the United
 
00:13:14.470 --> 00:13:14.480 align:start position:0%
States of America to the rep stands one
 
00:13:17.790 --> 00:13:17.800 align:start position:0%
nation under God indivisible with liy
 
00:13:24.030 --> 00:13:24.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:26.990 --> 00:13:27.000 align:start position:0%
all so uh before we get started I just
 
00:13:30.189 --> 00:13:30.199 align:start position:0%
wanted to just um uh a couple of sort of
 
00:13:31.750 --> 00:13:31.760 align:start position:0%
housekeeping matters just for the
 
00:13:36.790 --> 00:13:36.800 align:start position:0%
members of the committee to know um I uh
 
00:13:38.230 --> 00:13:38.240 align:start position:0%
I know that there have been that there
 
00:13:41.389 --> 00:13:41.399 align:start position:0%
have been some uh there expressions of
 
00:13:43.629 --> 00:13:43.639 align:start position:0%
angst and I I appreciate that about the
 
00:13:45.949 --> 00:13:45.959 align:start position:0%
fact that I have started all the
 
00:13:47.470 --> 00:13:47.480 align:start position:0%
hearings that I've scheduled and I've
 
00:13:49.550 --> 00:13:49.560 align:start position:0%
now scheduled out through February 21st
 
00:13:50.949 --> 00:13:50.959 align:start position:0%
so that we have all the bills scheduled
 
00:13:53.949 --> 00:13:53.959 align:start position:0%
for hearings I've scheduled those all at
 
00:13:57.590 --> 00:13:57.600 align:start position:0%
9:00 um and I know that that has created
 
00:13:59.949 --> 00:13:59.959 align:start position:0%
some angst for some people uh but I I
 
00:14:02.310 --> 00:14:02.320 align:start position:0%
think in order to the the speaker really
 
00:14:04.150 --> 00:14:04.160 align:start position:0%
wants us to get things so that they get
 
00:14:06.870 --> 00:14:06.880 align:start position:0%
to the they can get sessions so I think
 
00:14:08.430 --> 00:14:08.440 align:start position:0%
I'm probably am going to keep that in
 
00:14:10.949 --> 00:14:10.959 align:start position:0%
place but I have I have heard you and
 
00:14:13.389 --> 00:14:13.399 align:start position:0%
part particularly since for hearings we
 
00:14:15.350 --> 00:14:15.360 align:start position:0%
don't need to have a quorum if some of
 
00:14:17.910 --> 00:14:17.920 align:start position:0%
you you know straggle in a little bit
 
00:14:19.749 --> 00:14:19.759 align:start position:0%
late I'm not going to be keeping tabs on
 
00:14:22.350 --> 00:14:22.360 align:start position:0%
what time you show up but I will say
 
00:14:24.710 --> 00:14:24.720 align:start position:0%
that other than next Monday which I've
 
00:14:27.509 --> 00:14:27.519 align:start position:0%
already scheduled for any fur any future
 
00:14:29.470 --> 00:14:29.480 align:start position:0%
executive sessions I will schedule those
 
00:14:32.189 --> 00:14:32.199 align:start position:0%
to start at 10:00 um so that you know it
 
00:14:34.310 --> 00:14:34.320 align:start position:0%
give that because there that's where we
 
00:14:38.430 --> 00:14:38.440 align:start position:0%
do need a quorum um uh so I I will uh I
 
00:14:41.749 --> 00:14:41.759 align:start position:0%
will do that um I just wanted to I just
 
00:14:45.189 --> 00:14:45.199 align:start position:0%
wanted to um let everybody know that um
 
00:14:47.629 --> 00:14:47.639 align:start position:0%
and then with that um I think we're
 
00:14:50.629 --> 00:14:50.639 align:start position:0%
ready to turn to uh the business of of
 
00:14:53.870 --> 00:14:53.880 align:start position:0%
the executive uh session and so I'm
 
00:14:58.110 --> 00:14:58.120 align:start position:0%
first going to uh uh take up cacr 23 and
 
00:14:59.629 --> 00:14:59.639 align:start position:0%
I will represent recognize
 
00:15:01.430 --> 00:15:01.440 align:start position:0%
representative kab for a
 
00:15:04.949 --> 00:15:04.959 align:start position:0%
motion I move itl is there a second
 
00:15:06.990 --> 00:15:07.000 align:start position:0%
second it's been moved in seconded
 
00:15:08.470 --> 00:15:08.480 align:start position:0%
representative kav do wish to speak to
 
00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:12.470 align:start position:0%
representative kav do wish to speak to
your

00:15:12.470 --> 00:15:12.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:16.629 --> 00:15:16.639 align:start position:0%
motion so I think the majority of New
 
00:15:18.710 --> 00:15:18.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has spoken that they would
 
00:15:23.189 --> 00:15:23.199 align:start position:0%
like the law to stay as it is today
 
00:15:28.269 --> 00:15:28.279 align:start position:0%
and it is my hope that in the future we
 
00:15:31.430 --> 00:15:31.440 align:start position:0%
can come to a compromise on some
 
00:15:35.030 --> 00:15:35.040 align:start position:0%
language of a cacr that would keep the
 
00:15:38.350 --> 00:15:38.360 align:start position:0%
law as it is today however the problem
 
00:15:41.269 --> 00:15:41.279 align:start position:0%
with what we have before us is that it's
 
00:15:44.430 --> 00:15:44.440 align:start position:0%
not a cacr that just gives the right to
 
00:15:47.550 --> 00:15:47.560 align:start position:0%
abortion prior to 24 weeks but a
 
00:15:51.189 --> 00:15:51.199 align:start position:0%
cacr that gives the right to abortion if
 
00:15:53.110 --> 00:15:53.120 align:start position:0%
it's necessary after that for any reason
 
00:15:55.069 --> 00:15:55.079 align:start position:0%
right through birth and necessary can
 
00:15:57.550 --> 00:15:57.560 align:start position:0%
mean multiple things it is not defined
 
00:15:59.150 --> 00:15:59.160 align:start position:0%
as medically necessary so it can be
 
00:16:01.509 --> 00:16:01.519 align:start position:0%
necessary simply because somebody wants
 
00:16:04.590 --> 00:16:04.600 align:start position:0%
to have one and that is not what the
 
00:16:06.629 --> 00:16:06.639 align:start position:0%
majority of Voters have spoken on this
 
00:16:09.389 --> 00:16:09.399 align:start position:0%
bill alone I have gotten the most
 
00:16:13.550 --> 00:16:13.560 align:start position:0%
emails on any bill I have ever received
 
00:16:16.350 --> 00:16:16.360 align:start position:0%
asking to please itl this so I think
 
00:16:18.030 --> 00:16:18.040 align:start position:0%
even if this were to go to the voters it
 
00:16:20.069 --> 00:16:20.079 align:start position:0%
is not what the majority of the voters
 
00:16:23.550 --> 00:16:23.560 align:start position:0%
want either and so with that I think it
 
00:16:24.470 --> 00:16:24.480 align:start position:0%
should be
 
00:16:27.509 --> 00:16:27.519 align:start position:0%
itl other people wish to be
 
00:16:27.519 --> 00:16:29.870 align:start position:0%
itl other people wish to be
heard

00:16:29.870 --> 00:16:29.880 align:start position:0%
heard
 
00:16:31.470 --> 00:16:31.480 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
00:16:36.470 --> 00:16:36.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:41.749 --> 00:16:41.759 align:start position:0%
chair um as as a life
 
00:16:44.829 --> 00:16:44.839 align:start position:0%
supporting person in my personal ethical
 
00:16:46.509 --> 00:16:46.519 align:start position:0%
and religious
 
00:16:51.230 --> 00:16:51.240 align:start position:0%
beliefs um I hold that uh life begins at
 
00:16:53.309 --> 00:16:53.319 align:start position:0%
conception and it's sacred from the
 
00:16:55.150 --> 00:16:55.160 align:start position:0%
moment of conception to the moment of
 
00:16:55.160 --> 00:16:57.470 align:start position:0%
moment of conception to the moment of
natural

00:16:57.470 --> 00:16:57.480 align:start position:0%
natural
 
00:16:57.480 --> 00:16:59.189 align:start position:0%
natural
death

00:16:59.189 --> 00:16:59.199 align:start position:0%
death
 
00:17:03.309 --> 00:17:03.319 align:start position:0%
Article 2 part one of our New Hampshire
 
00:17:06.390 --> 00:17:06.400 align:start position:0%
Constitution protects
 
00:17:10.390 --> 00:17:10.400 align:start position:0%
respects life as part of our traditional
 
00:17:13.909 --> 00:17:13.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:18.069 --> 00:17:18.079 align:start position:0%
values this uh cacr
 
00:17:22.710 --> 00:17:22.720 align:start position:0%
23 um is counter and contrary to those
 
00:17:24.429 --> 00:17:24.439 align:start position:0%
traditions and
 
00:17:27.750 --> 00:17:27.760 align:start position:0%
beliefs and um I think that even if it
 
00:17:29.430 --> 00:17:29.440 align:start position:0%
were to pass there would be some
 
00:17:31.710 --> 00:17:31.720 align:start position:0%
constitutional problems with
 
00:17:36.789 --> 00:17:36.799 align:start position:0%
it um I think it's improper and wronge
 
00:17:41.549 --> 00:17:41.559 align:start position:0%
headed and therefore I'm voting itl on
 
00:17:45.710 --> 00:17:45.720 align:start position:0%
it other comments other people wish to
 
00:17:48.029 --> 00:17:48.039 align:start position:0%
be heard all right so I guess the only
 
00:17:50.029 --> 00:17:50.039 align:start position:0%
thing I would say on this I'm sorry did
 
00:17:51.710 --> 00:17:51.720 align:start position:0%
you want to say something the only thing
 
00:17:54.789 --> 00:17:54.799 align:start position:0%
I would say on this is um I think I I
 
00:17:57.070 --> 00:17:57.080 align:start position:0%
have a at least a somewhat nuanced
 
00:17:58.990 --> 00:17:59.000 align:start position:0%
position from representative k
 
00:18:01.830 --> 00:18:01.840 align:start position:0%
I'm as I've told people many many times
 
00:18:03.789 --> 00:18:03.799 align:start position:0%
I reg if somebody asked me what my views
 
00:18:05.510 --> 00:18:05.520 align:start position:0%
are on abortion I would say generally
 
00:18:08.350 --> 00:18:08.360 align:start position:0%
I'm pro-choice um but I do believe that
 
00:18:11.110 --> 00:18:11.120 align:start position:0%
there that that shouldn't mean that
 
00:18:13.029 --> 00:18:13.039 align:start position:0%
somebody has a right to an abortion up
 
00:18:16.590 --> 00:18:16.600 align:start position:0%
to very close to the time to birth and I
 
00:18:18.390 --> 00:18:18.400 align:start position:0%
I agree with representative katab that I
 
00:18:20.950 --> 00:18:20.960 align:start position:0%
think most people in New Hampshire think
 
00:18:23.909 --> 00:18:23.919 align:start position:0%
our current law which basically says you
 
00:18:25.950 --> 00:18:25.960 align:start position:0%
have six months if you're pregnant you
 
00:18:28.149 --> 00:18:28.159 align:start position:0%
have six months to make a decision as to
 
00:18:29.270 --> 00:18:29.280 align:start position:0%
what whether or not you want to have an
 
00:18:31.590 --> 00:18:31.600 align:start position:0%
abortion is a reasonable period of time
 
00:18:34.990 --> 00:18:35.000 align:start position:0%
and after that um I I think it's hard to
 
00:18:39.029 --> 00:18:39.039 align:start position:0%
argue that whatever your views are on
 
00:18:42.390 --> 00:18:42.400 align:start position:0%
sort of you know life uh and when it
 
00:18:44.590 --> 00:18:44.600 align:start position:0%
begins or it's it it does seem to me
 
00:18:46.029 --> 00:18:46.039 align:start position:0%
that it's hard to argue that there is
 
00:18:50.190 --> 00:18:50.200 align:start position:0%
not an increasing interest of society in
 
00:18:51.430 --> 00:18:51.440 align:start position:0%
in the
 
00:18:55.110 --> 00:18:55.120 align:start position:0%
protection of of uh the fetus or the
 
00:18:57.350 --> 00:18:57.360 align:start position:0%
child or whatever you want to call it
 
00:18:59.669 --> 00:18:59.679 align:start position:0%
that that interest interest increases as
 
00:19:02.190 --> 00:19:02.200 align:start position:0%
time goes on and at some point I mean if
 
00:19:04.830 --> 00:19:04.840 align:start position:0%
it if it doesn't then why is it why
 
00:19:06.950 --> 00:19:06.960 align:start position:0%
wouldn't it just be okay you know I
 
00:19:09.430 --> 00:19:09.440 align:start position:0%
suppose in some you know ghoulish kind
 
00:19:11.990 --> 00:19:12.000 align:start position:0%
of way we could say we're going to treat
 
00:19:15.390 --> 00:19:15.400 align:start position:0%
uh we're going to treat a a child as uh
 
00:19:17.470 --> 00:19:17.480 align:start position:0%
like a consumer product and Ju Just like
 
00:19:19.350 --> 00:19:19.360 align:start position:0%
when uh in some consumer transactions
 
00:19:22.110 --> 00:19:22.120 align:start position:0%
you have three days to cancel I suppose
 
00:19:23.630 --> 00:19:23.640 align:start position:0%
if we want to be really ghoulish we
 
00:19:25.310 --> 00:19:25.320 align:start position:0%
could say well you should have three
 
00:19:28.390 --> 00:19:28.400 align:start position:0%
days after birth to decide if the if
 
00:19:31.230 --> 00:19:31.240 align:start position:0%
want to cancel the transaction hopefully
 
00:19:33.630 --> 00:19:33.640 align:start position:0%
we we never get to that point but it
 
00:19:37.990 --> 00:19:38.000 align:start position:0%
seems to me that that um what what we
 
00:19:40.430 --> 00:19:40.440 align:start position:0%
have in law now of six months is a
 
00:19:43.270 --> 00:19:43.280 align:start position:0%
reasonable period that I believe most
 
00:19:44.750 --> 00:19:44.760 align:start position:0%
people in the state of New Hampshire
 
00:19:47.270 --> 00:19:47.280 align:start position:0%
share I would not support frankly
 
00:19:49.350 --> 00:19:49.360 align:start position:0%
imposing making the the Restriction any
 
00:19:51.149 --> 00:19:51.159 align:start position:0%
greater than that I know there's been
 
00:19:55.669 --> 00:19:55.679 align:start position:0%
some talk of reducing it uh somewhat uh
 
00:19:57.789 --> 00:19:57.799 align:start position:0%
because viability maybe or maybe in the
 
00:19:57.799 --> 00:19:58.750 align:start position:0%
because viability maybe or maybe in the
future

00:19:58.750 --> 00:19:58.760 align:start position:0%
future
 
00:20:01.590 --> 00:20:01.600 align:start position:0%
would uh would be would be at less than
 
00:20:03.590 --> 00:20:03.600 align:start position:0%
24 weeks
 
00:20:06.390 --> 00:20:06.400 align:start position:0%
um it's hard to say never but I think it
 
00:20:07.830 --> 00:20:07.840 align:start position:0%
would take a lot to convince me
 
00:20:09.190 --> 00:20:09.200 align:start position:0%
personally that that it would be
 
00:20:11.950 --> 00:20:11.960 align:start position:0%
appropriate to do that um having said
 
00:20:14.750 --> 00:20:14.760 align:start position:0%
that I I the area where I think I
 
00:20:16.430 --> 00:20:16.440 align:start position:0%
disagree with with representative kutab
 
00:20:17.990 --> 00:20:18.000 align:start position:0%
to some extent is I just don't think
 
00:20:19.789 --> 00:20:19.799 align:start position:0%
this is something that ought to be in
 
00:20:22.990 --> 00:20:23.000 align:start position:0%
the Constitution um although I regard
 
00:20:24.789 --> 00:20:24.799 align:start position:0%
myself as I said as pro-choice I think
 
00:20:26.630 --> 00:20:26.640 align:start position:0%
the Supreme Court made absolutely the
 
00:20:29.510 --> 00:20:29.520 align:start position:0%
right decision in DOS in overruling Ro v
 
00:20:33.149 --> 00:20:33.159 align:start position:0%
Wade because that was essentially the
 
00:20:35.590 --> 00:20:35.600 align:start position:0%
that was in an era roow was decided in
 
00:20:37.230 --> 00:20:37.240 align:start position:0%
an era where the Supreme Court thought
 
00:20:40.430 --> 00:20:40.440 align:start position:0%
it was really okay to kind of create new
 
00:20:43.710 --> 00:20:43.720 align:start position:0%
rights uh because nine people or in that
 
00:20:46.430 --> 00:20:46.440 align:start position:0%
case seven people uh on the court
 
00:20:48.710 --> 00:20:48.720 align:start position:0%
thought now this is a great idea let's
 
00:20:52.549 --> 00:20:52.559 align:start position:0%
create this new right um and I just
 
00:20:55.710 --> 00:20:55.720 align:start position:0%
fortunately the court uh now um has a
 
00:20:57.870 --> 00:20:57.880 align:start position:0%
different view on its Authority in this
 
00:21:00.270 --> 00:21:00.280 align:start position:0%
area area and um I think it made the
 
00:21:02.990 --> 00:21:03.000 align:start position:0%
absolutely the correct decision in in in
 
00:21:05.870 --> 00:21:05.880 align:start position:0%
uh dobs and now returned it to the
 
00:21:09.430 --> 00:21:09.440 align:start position:0%
states where it seems to me it should be
 
00:21:12.269 --> 00:21:12.279 align:start position:0%
something that is decided by uh through
 
00:21:15.390 --> 00:21:15.400 align:start position:0%
the political process as as almost
 
00:21:18.750 --> 00:21:18.760 align:start position:0%
everything uh that that we deal with uh
 
00:21:21.110 --> 00:21:21.120 align:start position:0%
is decided through the political process
 
00:21:23.510 --> 00:21:23.520 align:start position:0%
I I think that the public has made it
 
00:21:26.909 --> 00:21:26.919 align:start position:0%
pretty clear um where they stand and uh
 
00:21:28.909 --> 00:21:28.919 align:start position:0%
I think that that
 
00:21:31.029 --> 00:21:31.039 align:start position:0%
our law is now consistent with that so
 
00:21:33.310 --> 00:21:33.320 align:start position:0%
for that reason I'm going to support the
 
00:21:38.110 --> 00:21:38.120 align:start position:0%
itl any any other comments All right so
 
00:21:39.789 --> 00:21:39.799 align:start position:0%
I guess we're then we're ready to uh
 
00:21:42.549 --> 00:21:42.559 align:start position:0%

00:23:15.310 --> 00:23:15.320 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:23:20.510 --> 00:23:20.520 align:start position:0%
um I found my colleagues comments quite
 
00:23:24.789 --> 00:23:24.799 align:start position:0%
interesting um and uh respect their
 
00:23:28.190 --> 00:23:28.200 align:start position:0%
their right certainly to express the
 
00:23:30.590 --> 00:23:30.600 align:start position:0%
comments I do not
 
00:23:35.549 --> 00:23:35.559 align:start position:0%
agree um I support this Constitutional
 
00:23:38.149 --> 00:23:38.159 align:start position:0%
Amendment that would
 
00:23:41.470 --> 00:23:41.480 align:start position:0%
enshrine Reproductive Rights in the
 
00:23:44.190 --> 00:23:44.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's state
 
00:23:47.830 --> 00:23:47.840 align:start position:0%
constitution when I first entered the
 
00:23:51.950 --> 00:23:51.960 align:start position:0%
legislature which was
 
00:23:51.960 --> 00:23:54.630 align:start position:0%
legislature which was
overwhelmingly

00:23:54.630 --> 00:23:54.640 align:start position:0%
overwhelmingly
 
00:23:58.190 --> 00:23:58.200 align:start position:0%
Republican and I never found that to be
 
00:24:02.070 --> 00:24:02.080 align:start position:0%
a problem for all the years until quite
 
00:24:05.950 --> 00:24:05.960 align:start position:0%
shockingly for the first time in history
 
00:24:08.430 --> 00:24:08.440 align:start position:0%
since Adam and Eve almost um the
 
00:24:10.350 --> 00:24:10.360 align:start position:0%
Democrats were in the
 
00:24:12.950 --> 00:24:12.960 align:start position:0%
majority certain things changed but a
 
00:24:16.269 --> 00:24:16.279 align:start position:0%
lot of things didn't what was consistent
 
00:24:19.870 --> 00:24:19.880 align:start position:0%
always and I believe at some level is
 
00:24:25.310 --> 00:24:25.320 align:start position:0%
still here is that in New Hampshire we
 
00:24:29.470 --> 00:24:29.480 align:start position:0%
respect privacy and and what was a
 
00:24:34.149 --> 00:24:34.159 align:start position:0%
classic libertarian attitude but not
 
00:24:37.430 --> 00:24:37.440 align:start position:0%
one sometimes definitions change but was
 
00:24:41.029 --> 00:24:41.039 align:start position:0%
that the state should stay out
 
00:24:45.230 --> 00:24:45.240 align:start position:0%
of private rights the state should say
 
00:24:49.070 --> 00:24:49.080 align:start position:0%
stay out and that was something that
 
00:24:51.630 --> 00:24:51.640 align:start position:0%
everybody overwhelmingly Republican in
 
00:24:51.640 --> 00:24:52.830 align:start position:0%
everybody overwhelmingly Republican in
the

00:24:52.830 --> 00:24:52.840 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:24:56.029 --> 00:24:56.039 align:start position:0%
legislature but somewhat increasingly
 
00:24:58.350 --> 00:24:58.360 align:start position:0%
mixed in terms of the public
 
00:25:01.350 --> 00:25:01.360 align:start position:0%
because a political party felt the same
 
00:25:05.789 --> 00:25:05.799 align:start position:0%
way um and we were quite comfortable
 
00:25:08.630 --> 00:25:08.640 align:start position:0%
with that then over the years things
 
00:25:13.070 --> 00:25:13.080 align:start position:0%
changed what changed um when the Supreme
 
00:25:17.909 --> 00:25:17.919 align:start position:0%
Court uh uh overturned uh
 
00:25:21.630 --> 00:25:21.640 align:start position:0%
row um was that the Supreme Court stated
 
00:25:24.430 --> 00:25:24.440 align:start position:0%
as clearly as
 
00:25:28.590 --> 00:25:28.600 align:start position:0%
possible that these decisions should be
 
00:25:32.470 --> 00:25:32.480 align:start position:0%
made not at the federal level but at the
 
00:25:36.070 --> 00:25:36.080 align:start position:0%
state level that is what the decision St
 
00:25:40.149 --> 00:25:40.159 align:start position:0%
it is up to the states to
 
00:25:45.470 --> 00:25:45.480 align:start position:0%
decide in this body with 400
 
00:25:48.110 --> 00:25:48.120 align:start position:0%
people people from other states laugh
 
00:25:51.870 --> 00:25:51.880 align:start position:0%
when we have a total population of 1.3
 
00:25:55.630 --> 00:25:55.640 align:start position:0%
million how do you have a legislature of
 
00:25:58.430 --> 00:25:58.440 align:start position:0%
400 each one of us rep representing a
 
00:26:01.630 --> 00:26:01.640 align:start position:0%
little over 3,000 people and the answer
 
00:26:05.630 --> 00:26:05.640 align:start position:0%
is it is the best way that we could stay
 
00:26:09.470 --> 00:26:09.480 align:start position:0%
close as we choose in this state to a
 
00:26:12.549 --> 00:26:12.559 align:start position:0%
direct democracy not a representative
 
00:26:14.029 --> 00:26:14.039 align:start position:0%
democracy but a
 
00:26:17.149 --> 00:26:17.159 align:start position:0%
direct uh and that's why when we go into
 
00:26:19.430 --> 00:26:19.440 align:start position:0%
the grocery store We're stopped by our
 
00:26:21.470 --> 00:26:21.480 align:start position:0%
neighbors because they know who we are
 
00:26:26.269 --> 00:26:26.279 align:start position:0%
doesn't happen in other states um in a
 
00:26:28.149 --> 00:26:28.159 align:start position:0%
direct uh
 
00:26:30.710 --> 00:26:30.720 align:start position:0%
democracy it is the
 
00:26:34.909 --> 00:26:34.919 align:start position:0%
people who make decisions on important
 
00:26:38.149 --> 00:26:38.159 align:start position:0%
issues and that has always been the way
 
00:26:41.070 --> 00:26:41.080 align:start position:0%
we have done it in this state and it is
 
00:26:45.269 --> 00:26:45.279 align:start position:0%
a way that I respect let the people
 
00:26:48.110 --> 00:26:48.120 align:start position:0%
decide it is important that we don't
 
00:26:50.149 --> 00:26:50.159 align:start position:0%
take this lightly and that it's not a
 
00:26:53.029 --> 00:26:53.039 align:start position:0%
frivolous act on our part which is why
 
00:26:55.230 --> 00:26:55.240 align:start position:0%
we require
 
00:26:58.990 --> 00:26:59.000 align:start position:0%
60% of the legislature a super majority
 
00:27:02.110 --> 00:27:02.120 align:start position:0%
60% of the legislature to vote on a
 
00:27:03.990 --> 00:27:04.000 align:start position:0%
constitutional amendment so we're not
 
00:27:06.590 --> 00:27:06.600 align:start position:0%
just forgetting our responsibility as
 
00:27:09.389 --> 00:27:09.399 align:start position:0%
legislators and sending everything out
 
00:27:12.669 --> 00:27:12.679 align:start position:0%
it is equally true that it is important
 
00:27:17.149 --> 00:27:17.159 align:start position:0%
to recognize the the incredible
 
00:27:18.630 --> 00:27:18.640 align:start position:0%
significance of amending the
 
00:27:21.870 --> 00:27:21.880 align:start position:0%
Constitution and that is why for the
 
00:27:26.510 --> 00:27:26.520 align:start position:0%
citizens it requires not 60% but 66 and
 
00:27:29.909 --> 00:27:29.919 align:start position:0%
23% something that is very hard to
 
00:27:33.350 --> 00:27:33.360 align:start position:0%
achieve and increasingly hard in an
 
00:27:35.830 --> 00:27:35.840 align:start position:0%
environment which has pits people
 
00:27:38.230 --> 00:27:38.240 align:start position:0%
against each other I don't object to the
 
00:27:42.190 --> 00:27:42.200 align:start position:0%
66 and 2/3 I think if two out of three
 
00:27:45.310 --> 00:27:45.320 align:start position:0%
voters think the the Constitutional
 
00:27:47.470 --> 00:27:47.480 align:start position:0%
Amendment the Constitution should change
 
00:27:52.070 --> 00:27:52.080 align:start position:0%
so be it and I think if one is it fewer
 
00:27:55.110 --> 00:27:55.120 align:start position:0%
or less I always get confused if there's
 
00:27:59.590 --> 00:27:59.600 align:start position:0%
one vote short on the 66 and
 
00:28:02.950 --> 00:28:02.960 align:start position:0%
23 and and and cons Amendment doesn't
 
00:28:06.990 --> 00:28:07.000 align:start position:0%
pass that's okay too but we have gone to
 
00:28:10.310 --> 00:28:10.320 align:start position:0%
the people and asked them how do you
 
00:28:14.789 --> 00:28:14.799 align:start position:0%
think about this issue which affects
 
00:28:19.110 --> 00:28:19.120 align:start position:0%
everybody every family in their most
 
00:28:24.269 --> 00:28:24.279 align:start position:0%
private decisions and it is therefore by
 
00:28:28.509 --> 00:28:28.519 align:start position:0%
very strongly held view that that this
 
00:28:31.310 --> 00:28:31.320 align:start position:0%
body has an obligation to the citizens
 
00:28:35.190 --> 00:28:35.200 align:start position:0%
of the state to vote on this and if we
 
00:28:39.389 --> 00:28:39.399 align:start position:0%
can get a majority in this committee
 
00:28:43.149 --> 00:28:43.159 align:start position:0%
wonderful if we can get a 60% majority
 
00:28:46.870 --> 00:28:46.880 align:start position:0%
in the floor wonderful each of those
 
00:28:51.230 --> 00:28:51.240 align:start position:0%
votes takes us closest to the people
 
00:28:53.909 --> 00:28:53.919 align:start position:0%
where we are asking them to decide on
 
00:28:57.549 --> 00:28:57.559 align:start position:0%
something that could not be more of a
 
00:29:01.789 --> 00:29:01.799 align:start position:0%
private personal decision than this and
 
00:29:06.070 --> 00:29:06.080 align:start position:0%
therefore I ask you all to support um
 
00:29:07.990 --> 00:29:08.000 align:start position:0%
the OTP
 
00:29:10.070 --> 00:29:10.080 align:start position:0%
motion anyone else wish to be
 
00:29:10.080 --> 00:29:11.430 align:start position:0%
motion anyone else wish to be
representative

00:29:11.430 --> 00:29:11.440 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:29:14.110 --> 00:29:14.120 align:start position:0%
tur yeah I I just wanted to add to those
 
00:29:16.990 --> 00:29:17.000 align:start position:0%
comments uh in turn and and and somewhat
 
00:29:20.630 --> 00:29:20.640 align:start position:0%
respond to to what was um said um by Mr
 
00:29:23.470 --> 00:29:23.480 align:start position:0%
chair on the on the last vote um making
 
00:29:25.750 --> 00:29:25.760 align:start position:0%
the distinction between uh a
 
00:29:28.830 --> 00:29:28.840 align:start position:0%
constitutional right first is a law in
 
00:29:31.430 --> 00:29:31.440 align:start position:0%
the books and I feel that it's important
 
00:29:34.830 --> 00:29:34.840 align:start position:0%
for this point to focus on uh the idea
 
00:29:37.430 --> 00:29:37.440 align:start position:0%
of Rights being things that are you know
 
00:29:41.669 --> 00:29:41.679 align:start position:0%
inherent and and uh deeply personal and
 
00:29:43.029 --> 00:29:43.039 align:start position:0%
basically things that we as the
 
00:29:46.549 --> 00:29:46.559 align:start position:0%
legislature should not you know be in
 
00:29:49.190 --> 00:29:49.200 align:start position:0%
involved in and you know I think our
 
00:29:52.190 --> 00:29:52.200 align:start position:0%
reproduction our our choices about our
 
00:29:55.590 --> 00:29:55.600 align:start position:0%
our reproduction um really constitute
 
00:29:56.990 --> 00:29:57.000 align:start position:0%
you know in terms of the concept of
 
00:29:59.230 --> 00:29:59.240 align:start position:0%
freedom fre and Liberty over our bodies
 
00:30:01.470 --> 00:30:01.480 align:start position:0%
some of the most deeply held and
 
00:30:05.750 --> 00:30:05.760 align:start position:0%
personal um choices that people make in
 
00:30:09.070 --> 00:30:09.080 align:start position:0%
in their lives and
 
00:30:13.710 --> 00:30:13.720 align:start position:0%
uh the reason that it should I think be
 
00:30:17.190 --> 00:30:17.200 align:start position:0%
in our constitution is to restore what
 
00:30:19.230 --> 00:30:19.240 align:start position:0%
most people have come to expect over the
 
00:30:23.029 --> 00:30:23.039 align:start position:0%
course of their lives um as a what had
 
00:30:25.350 --> 00:30:25.360 align:start position:0%
been a consensus that basically these
 
00:30:28.669 --> 00:30:28.679 align:start position:0%
are areas where at least up to you know
 
00:30:31.430 --> 00:30:31.440 align:start position:0%
the levels that are are embodied in this
 
00:30:34.669 --> 00:30:34.679 align:start position:0%
cacr um the legislature doesn't have a
 
00:30:38.310 --> 00:30:38.320 align:start position:0%
role um and and our personal choices you
 
00:30:41.070 --> 00:30:41.080 align:start position:0%
know extending beyond the the end of our
 
00:30:44.669 --> 00:30:44.679 align:start position:0%
Our Lives um you know at 24 weeks the
 
00:30:46.789 --> 00:30:46.799 align:start position:0%
the statement you know natural death you
 
00:30:50.350 --> 00:30:50.360 align:start position:0%
know right now natural extension of of
 
00:30:52.269 --> 00:30:52.279 align:start position:0%
life is is highly supported by
 
00:30:56.389 --> 00:30:56.399 align:start position:0%
technology at that at that age um of of
 
00:30:58.110 --> 00:30:58.120 align:start position:0%
development so
 
00:30:59.509 --> 00:30:59.519 align:start position:0%
I just I just wanted to make the
 
00:31:02.789 --> 00:31:02.799 align:start position:0%
distinction for for you know the the the
 
00:31:05.509 --> 00:31:05.519 align:start position:0%
discussion between why we would have a
 
00:31:07.710 --> 00:31:07.720 align:start position:0%
constitutional amendment to him trying
 
00:31:10.430 --> 00:31:10.440 align:start position:0%
to write that keeps us out of people's
 
00:31:13.470 --> 00:31:13.480 align:start position:0%
lives versus a law that can change
 
00:31:15.710 --> 00:31:15.720 align:start position:0%
rapidly back and forth and really cause
 
00:31:17.789 --> 00:31:17.799 align:start position:0%
you know a lot of consternation uh the
 
00:31:20.230 --> 00:31:20.240 align:start position:0%
bills that we'll hear shortly you know
 
00:31:24.629 --> 00:31:24.639 align:start position:0%
also generated a lot of input um uh and
 
00:31:27.669 --> 00:31:27.679 align:start position:0%
and caused a lot of of uh
 
00:31:30.070 --> 00:31:30.080 align:start position:0%
anxiety for people in terms of our our
 
00:31:33.149 --> 00:31:33.159 align:start position:0%
state so that's all other yes
 
00:31:37.669 --> 00:31:37.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:41.789 --> 00:31:41.799 align:start position:0%
chair it was brought up that the state
 
00:31:44.509 --> 00:31:44.519 align:start position:0%
should not be involved in these very
 
00:31:47.029 --> 00:31:47.039 align:start position:0%
personal matters and yet in this
 
00:31:49.110 --> 00:31:49.120 align:start position:0%
Constitutional Amendment the wording
 
00:31:51.870 --> 00:31:51.880 align:start position:0%
says the state cannot prohibit restrict
 
00:31:54.470 --> 00:31:54.480 align:start position:0%
delay or penalize this right prior to 24
 
00:31:57.110 --> 00:31:57.120 align:start position:0%
weeks unless it is justified by a comp
 
00:31:59.470 --> 00:31:59.480 align:start position:0%
compelling State interest achieved by
 
00:32:01.710 --> 00:32:01.720 align:start position:0%
the least restrictive means so this
 
00:32:03.909 --> 00:32:03.919 align:start position:0%
Constitutional Amendment still allows
 
00:32:06.269 --> 00:32:06.279 align:start position:0%
the state to stick its nose in other
 
00:32:08.789 --> 00:32:08.799 align:start position:0%
people's business so what is a
 
00:32:10.470 --> 00:32:10.480 align:start position:0%
compelling State
 
00:32:13.230 --> 00:32:13.240 align:start position:0%
interest if the state has no
 
00:32:15.269 --> 00:32:15.279 align:start position:0%
interest if the state is to keep its
 
00:32:17.149 --> 00:32:17.159 align:start position:0%
nose out of it then then this is a
 
00:32:19.350 --> 00:32:19.360 align:start position:0%
fatally flawed Constitutional Amendment
 
00:32:19.360 --> 00:32:21.310 align:start position:0%
fatally flawed Constitutional Amendment
right

00:32:21.310 --> 00:32:21.320 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:32:23.509 --> 00:32:23.519 align:start position:0%
here other
 
00:32:26.070 --> 00:32:26.080 align:start position:0%
comments yes representative
 
00:32:29.230 --> 00:32:29.240 align:start position:0%
Perez when I was
 
00:32:32.710 --> 00:32:32.720 align:start position:0%
campaigning I would say 90% of the
 
00:32:35.789 --> 00:32:35.799 align:start position:0%
people that asked me about our abortion
 
00:32:37.870 --> 00:32:37.880 align:start position:0%
law had no
 
00:32:41.190 --> 00:32:41.200 align:start position:0%
idea what our abortion law was here in
 
00:32:43.990 --> 00:32:44.000 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire and I would
 
00:32:48.950 --> 00:32:48.960 align:start position:0%
say of that 90% at least 70% were
 
00:32:51.950 --> 00:32:51.960 align:start position:0%
shocked that it was 24
 
00:32:54.990 --> 00:32:55.000 align:start position:0%
weeks my constituents that I have heard
 
00:32:58.950 --> 00:32:58.960 align:start position:0%
it wanted less they elected us to make
 
00:33:02.950 --> 00:33:02.960 align:start position:0%
informed decisions for them because they
 
00:33:06.549 --> 00:33:06.559 align:start position:0%
cannot know everything that is going
 
00:33:10.629 --> 00:33:10.639 align:start position:0%
on and I think I was elected to make
 
00:33:13.269 --> 00:33:13.279 align:start position:0%
informed decisions I think if you put
 
00:33:13.279 --> 00:33:14.149 align:start position:0%
informed decisions I think if you put
this

00:33:14.149 --> 00:33:14.159 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:33:16.789 --> 00:33:16.799 align:start position:0%
out to the
 
00:33:20.110 --> 00:33:20.120 align:start position:0%
public you're not going to have informed
 
00:33:22.830 --> 00:33:22.840 align:start position:0%
decisions people may go for it or they
 
00:33:25.590 --> 00:33:25.600 align:start position:0%
may not go but I'm going to say it's not
 
00:33:27.750 --> 00:33:27.760 align:start position:0%
going to be an informed decision
 
00:33:30.269 --> 00:33:30.279 align:start position:0%
and therefore I think it's the right and
 
00:33:32.750 --> 00:33:32.760 align:start position:0%
the obligation of those of us that are
 
00:33:35.870 --> 00:33:35.880 align:start position:0%
elected to make these
 
00:33:40.070 --> 00:33:40.080 align:start position:0%
informed decisions for our
 
00:33:42.470 --> 00:33:42.480 align:start position:0%
constituents other other comments yes
 
00:33:45.070 --> 00:33:45.080 align:start position:0%
representative L please um I just want
 
00:33:47.310 --> 00:33:47.320 align:start position:0%
to say first of all when we do get
 
00:33:49.830 --> 00:33:49.840 align:start position:0%
testimony we only get a certain
 
00:33:51.830 --> 00:33:51.840 align:start position:0%
percentage of testimony we're not
 
00:33:54.549 --> 00:33:54.559 align:start position:0%
hearing from all of our voters out there
 
00:33:56.750 --> 00:33:56.760 align:start position:0%
so number one I think we really need to
 
00:34:00.590 --> 00:34:00.600 align:start position:0%
think think about um how important it is
 
00:34:03.350 --> 00:34:03.360 align:start position:0%
that we place this on the ballot and to
 
00:34:05.629 --> 00:34:05.639 align:start position:0%
become a constit constitutional
 
00:34:08.790 --> 00:34:08.800 align:start position:0%
amendment because I think the we need to
 
00:34:11.629 --> 00:34:11.639 align:start position:0%
hear from all of the voters out there um
 
00:34:14.510 --> 00:34:14.520 align:start position:0%
that have not been represented and have
 
00:34:18.869 --> 00:34:18.879 align:start position:0%
not been heard from I think all women
 
00:34:24.030 --> 00:34:24.040 align:start position:0%
need to have the right to um get the the
 
00:34:27.389 --> 00:34:27.399 align:start position:0%
care that they need and this is so very
 
00:34:30.149 --> 00:34:30.159 align:start position:0%
important um so I think that was lady
 
00:34:32.869 --> 00:34:32.879 align:start position:0%
say we need to consider this it's what
 
00:34:35.430 --> 00:34:35.440 align:start position:0%
we're getting is the testimonies that we
 
00:34:38.069 --> 00:34:38.079 align:start position:0%
get from um voters out there are only a
 
00:34:40.069 --> 00:34:40.079 align:start position:0%
certain percentage and we really need to
 
00:34:42.669 --> 00:34:42.679 align:start position:0%
think about that as we make our
 
00:34:45.589 --> 00:34:45.599 align:start position:0%
decisions and I just want to thank you
 
00:34:48.669 --> 00:34:48.679 align:start position:0%
for letting me speak thank you other
 
00:34:50.990 --> 00:34:51.000 align:start position:0%
comments uh yes representative Staples
 
00:34:53.149 --> 00:34:53.159 align:start position:0%
please thank you Mr
 
00:34:56.109 --> 00:34:56.119 align:start position:0%
chair my emails are running somewhere
 
00:34:58.109 --> 00:34:58.119 align:start position:0%
around 25 5
 
00:35:02.310 --> 00:35:02.320 align:start position:0%
to1 opposed to cacr
 
00:35:06.750 --> 00:35:06.760 align:start position:0%
23 and so many of the comments um have
 
00:35:10.990 --> 00:35:11.000 align:start position:0%
indicated that uh 24 weeks is reasonable
 
00:35:13.109 --> 00:35:13.119 align:start position:0%
one even said well that's about
 
00:35:15.750 --> 00:35:15.760 align:start position:0%
right so it does reflect a lot of
 
00:35:15.760 --> 00:35:17.829 align:start position:0%
right so it does reflect a lot of
variability

00:35:17.829 --> 00:35:17.839 align:start position:0%
variability
 
00:35:19.829 --> 00:35:19.839 align:start position:0%
in uh the
 
00:35:24.069 --> 00:35:24.079 align:start position:0%
constituency support or opposition to
 
00:35:27.710 --> 00:35:27.720 align:start position:0%
abortion but yet they've come and told
 
00:35:34.109 --> 00:35:34.119 align:start position:0%
us that um this is over the line um and
 
00:35:36.030 --> 00:35:36.040 align:start position:0%
we shouldn't be making this a matter of
 
00:35:39.150 --> 00:35:39.160 align:start position:0%
constitution talking about
 
00:35:42.069 --> 00:35:42.079 align:start position:0%
Constitution dobs had two important
 
00:35:44.109 --> 00:35:44.119 align:start position:0%
points and of course the one that's
 
00:35:46.510 --> 00:35:46.520 align:start position:0%
stressed more important most importantly
 
00:35:49.670 --> 00:35:49.680 align:start position:0%
in in media and culture today is uh it's
 
00:35:52.950 --> 00:35:52.960 align:start position:0%
a state's rights well that's very
 
00:35:55.390 --> 00:35:55.400 align:start position:0%
important but the other important point
 
00:35:58.030 --> 00:35:58.040 align:start position:0%
which was foremost
 
00:36:01.910 --> 00:36:01.920 align:start position:0%
dob said the Constitution affords no
 
00:36:06.109 --> 00:36:06.119 align:start position:0%
constitutional right for an
 
00:36:09.550 --> 00:36:09.560 align:start position:0%
abortion and if that's the case because
 
00:36:12.430 --> 00:36:12.440 align:start position:0%
we have the right to life liberty and
 
00:36:14.910 --> 00:36:14.920 align:start position:0%
property in the
 
00:36:17.309 --> 00:36:17.319 align:start position:0%
Constitution uh abortion in a
 
00:36:19.950 --> 00:36:19.960 align:start position:0%
constitutional amend would be
 
00:36:23.150 --> 00:36:23.160 align:start position:0%
contraindicated against the right to
 
00:36:28.150 --> 00:36:28.160 align:start position:0%
life as far as laws well we had 52 years
 
00:36:32.710 --> 00:36:32.720 align:start position:0%
a permissive a liberty uh in law was
 
00:36:32.720 --> 00:36:34.030 align:start position:0%
a permissive a liberty uh in law was
contrary

00:36:34.030 --> 00:36:34.040 align:start position:0%
contrary
 
00:36:36.990 --> 00:36:37.000 align:start position:0%
to the
 
00:36:42.230 --> 00:36:42.240 align:start position:0%
Constitution um as as dos points out um
 
00:36:45.510 --> 00:36:45.520 align:start position:0%
was an error in affording a right that
 
00:36:47.870 --> 00:36:47.880 align:start position:0%
is not guaranteed or provided for in the
 
00:36:51.349 --> 00:36:51.359 align:start position:0%
Constitution so laws should comply with
 
00:36:53.950 --> 00:36:53.960 align:start position:0%
what we have in Constitution the feds
 
00:36:57.950 --> 00:36:57.960 align:start position:0%
were sending us a message yes you states
 
00:37:01.510 --> 00:37:01.520 align:start position:0%
can go and deal with this issue as is
 
00:37:03.430 --> 00:37:03.440 align:start position:0%
appropriate for states
 
00:37:06.190 --> 00:37:06.200 align:start position:0%
rights but be
 
00:37:08.870 --> 00:37:08.880 align:start position:0%
advised that there is no right to
 
00:37:10.750 --> 00:37:10.760 align:start position:0%
abortion in the
 
00:37:12.910 --> 00:37:12.920 align:start position:0%
Constitution what they were doing is
 
00:37:16.030 --> 00:37:16.040 align:start position:0%
reinforcing the importance of Life the
 
00:37:21.390 --> 00:37:21.400 align:start position:0%
state interest to see life um be
 
00:37:24.190 --> 00:37:24.200 align:start position:0%
developed and then born into
 
00:37:26.990 --> 00:37:27.000 align:start position:0%
citizenry and so they're they're
 
00:37:29.270 --> 00:37:29.280 align:start position:0%
pointing us to the direction that we
 
00:37:31.510 --> 00:37:31.520 align:start position:0%
should consider this very very
 
00:37:35.430 --> 00:37:35.440 align:start position:0%
carefully and not even come close to
 
00:37:39.349 --> 00:37:39.359 align:start position:0%
violating not respecting life not only
 
00:37:43.430 --> 00:37:43.440 align:start position:0%
born life and adult life but also nass
 
00:37:47.790 --> 00:37:47.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:52.550 --> 00:37:52.560 align:start position:0%
womb so I I'm I'm I'm opposed to the uh
 
00:37:55.309 --> 00:37:55.319 align:start position:0%
OTP on on cacr
 
00:37:58.670 --> 00:37:58.680 align:start position:0%
23 repres CH yeah just just one more
 
00:38:00.589 --> 00:38:00.599 align:start position:0%
Point since we had we drifted into sort
 
00:38:02.870 --> 00:38:02.880 align:start position:0%
of the the the balance of the input that
 
00:38:04.710 --> 00:38:04.720 align:start position:0%
we got through our testimony and through
 
00:38:06.950 --> 00:38:06.960 align:start position:0%
our emails um I just wanted to lift up
 
00:38:09.950 --> 00:38:09.960 align:start position:0%
that we also have the sign-ins online um
 
00:38:11.990 --> 00:38:12.000 align:start position:0%
which represents a larger group of
 
00:38:14.270 --> 00:38:14.280 align:start position:0%
people than any of those others and and
 
00:38:18.630 --> 00:38:18.640 align:start position:0%
um the the sign-ins from this bill were
 
00:38:22.710 --> 00:38:22.720 align:start position:0%
1,713 in support um 303 opposed and one
 
00:38:25.589 --> 00:38:25.599 align:start position:0%
neutral so you know there there was a
 
00:38:27.870 --> 00:38:27.880 align:start position:0%
fairly overwhelming in uh level of
 
00:38:29.630 --> 00:38:29.640 align:start position:0%
support for people who took the time to
 
00:38:31.829 --> 00:38:31.839 align:start position:0%
sign into our committee
 
00:38:35.349 --> 00:38:35.359 align:start position:0%
thanks other comments um the only the
 
00:38:37.870 --> 00:38:37.880 align:start position:0%
only the only other thing I would say I
 
00:38:39.230 --> 00:38:39.240 align:start position:0%
to that because I think representative
 
00:38:43.470 --> 00:38:43.480 align:start position:0%
gon raised an important Point as I in
 
00:38:44.910 --> 00:38:44.920 align:start position:0%
some of the questions that I asked
 
00:38:47.190 --> 00:38:47.200 align:start position:0%
during the hearing I
 
00:38:50.309 --> 00:38:50.319 align:start position:0%
I even if I try to put myself in the in
 
00:38:53.910 --> 00:38:53.920 align:start position:0%
the in the shoes of the supporters of
 
00:38:56.190 --> 00:38:56.200 align:start position:0%
this amendment I really do think that
 
00:38:58.589 --> 00:38:58.599 align:start position:0%
from your I would think that from your
 
00:39:00.790 --> 00:39:00.800 align:start position:0%
perspective there are some problems with
 
00:39:03.390 --> 00:39:03.400 align:start position:0%
this amendment as I indicated before
 
00:39:05.349 --> 00:39:05.359 align:start position:0%
first of all the the the first line
 
00:39:07.309 --> 00:39:07.319 align:start position:0%
every individual has a fundamental right
 
00:39:11.309 --> 00:39:11.319 align:start position:0%
to abortion well it seems to me if this
 
00:39:14.829 --> 00:39:14.839 align:start position:0%
were actually to pass you would for sure
 
00:39:19.710 --> 00:39:19.720 align:start position:0%
have a father saying wait a minute um I
 
00:39:23.150 --> 00:39:23.160 align:start position:0%
have the right if if if uh the the woman
 
00:39:26.069 --> 00:39:26.079 align:start position:0%
that I've impregnated wants uh wants to
 
00:39:28.910 --> 00:39:28.920 align:start position:0%
have baby and I don't want her to have
 
00:39:31.589 --> 00:39:31.599 align:start position:0%
the baby I have some right uh under this
 
00:39:33.190 --> 00:39:33.200 align:start position:0%
proposed constitutional amendment to
 
00:39:35.470 --> 00:39:35.480 align:start position:0%
insist that she have an abortion because
 
00:39:37.550 --> 00:39:37.560 align:start position:0%
every individual not just the pregnant
 
00:39:39.870 --> 00:39:39.880 align:start position:0%
person has a fundamental right at least
 
00:39:41.510 --> 00:39:41.520 align:start position:0%
that would be an argument and if you
 
00:39:43.870 --> 00:39:43.880 align:start position:0%
really I assume that the people who are
 
00:39:46.230 --> 00:39:46.240 align:start position:0%
supporting this didn't intend that so
 
00:39:49.349 --> 00:39:49.359 align:start position:0%
why not say if you're if it's not you
 
00:39:51.150 --> 00:39:51.160 align:start position:0%
know politically correct from your point
 
00:39:53.270 --> 00:39:53.280 align:start position:0%
of view to say only women can get
 
00:39:56.630 --> 00:39:56.640 align:start position:0%
pregnant um why not say uh every
 
00:39:58.790 --> 00:39:58.800 align:start position:0%
pregnant person has the right to an
 
00:40:01.270 --> 00:40:01.280 align:start position:0%
abortion instead of every individual I I
 
00:40:02.670 --> 00:40:02.680 align:start position:0%
don't quite understand it from your
 
00:40:04.589 --> 00:40:04.599 align:start position:0%
perspective the second thing that I
 
00:40:06.710 --> 00:40:06.720 align:start position:0%
don't understand is as I understand the
 
00:40:08.829 --> 00:40:08.839 align:start position:0%
law the law right
 
00:40:12.589 --> 00:40:12.599 align:start position:0%
now up to 24 weeks a woman has the right
 
00:40:14.990 --> 00:40:15.000 align:start position:0%
to have an abortion for any reason or no
 
00:40:17.550 --> 00:40:17.560 align:start position:0%
reason doesn't have to give a reason um
 
00:40:20.150 --> 00:40:20.160 align:start position:0%
and there's no sort of balancing does
 
00:40:22.630 --> 00:40:22.640 align:start position:0%
the state have some compelling interest
 
00:40:24.710 --> 00:40:24.720 align:start position:0%
to prevent her under the law from having
 
00:40:27.829 --> 00:40:27.839 align:start position:0%
an abortion if this Constitutional
 
00:40:29.750 --> 00:40:29.760 align:start position:0%
Amendment were adopted it would seem to
 
00:40:33.910 --> 00:40:33.920 align:start position:0%
suggest that um that imposes some kind
 
00:40:36.069 --> 00:40:36.079 align:start position:0%
of or at least could impose some kind of
 
00:40:38.790 --> 00:40:38.800 align:start position:0%
additional restriction uh that the state
 
00:40:40.430 --> 00:40:40.440 align:start position:0%
could come along and say well it's under
 
00:40:44.750 --> 00:40:44.760 align:start position:0%
24 weeks but there's some I don't know
 
00:40:47.430 --> 00:40:47.440 align:start position:0%
some reason that uh is a constitutes a
 
00:40:49.349 --> 00:40:49.359 align:start position:0%
compelling interest that the state
 
00:40:50.750 --> 00:40:50.760 align:start position:0%
should be able to
 
00:40:54.309 --> 00:40:54.319 align:start position:0%
intervene I again I guess I don't
 
00:40:57.349 --> 00:40:57.359 align:start position:0%
understand um why you would word things
 
00:41:01.190 --> 00:41:01.200 align:start position:0%
this way even from your perspective uh
 
00:41:04.430 --> 00:41:04.440 align:start position:0%
representative Smith thank you um Mr
 
00:41:07.910 --> 00:41:07.920 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for your comments um
 
00:41:12.670 --> 00:41:12.680 align:start position:0%
I know that nothing that has been said
 
00:41:15.349 --> 00:41:15.359 align:start position:0%
since this discussion
 
00:41:19.550 --> 00:41:19.560 align:start position:0%
began has changed let me reward that I
 
00:41:21.510 --> 00:41:21.520 align:start position:0%
would think it highly
 
00:41:24.589 --> 00:41:24.599 align:start position:0%
unlikely that anything that has been
 
00:41:29.630 --> 00:41:29.640 align:start position:0%
said um has changed the views of the 20
 
00:41:32.270 --> 00:41:32.280 align:start position:0%
people on this committee who have to
 
00:41:35.510 --> 00:41:35.520 align:start position:0%
make a decision now knowing that there
 
00:41:38.150 --> 00:41:38.160 align:start position:0%
will be countless opportunities in the
 
00:41:41.550 --> 00:41:41.560 align:start position:0%
future to further debate and therefore
 
00:41:44.990 --> 00:41:45.000 align:start position:0%
other than having people feel good about
 
00:41:47.589 --> 00:41:47.599 align:start position:0%
saying what they're saying I would like
 
00:41:49.550 --> 00:41:49.560 align:start position:0%
to move the
 
00:41:52.790 --> 00:41:52.800 align:start position:0%
question all right seeing no further
 
00:41:54.470 --> 00:41:54.480 align:start position:0%
discussion I think it's time to call the
 
00:41:57.510 --> 00:41:57.520 align:start position:0%
role the motion before us is is on ought
 
00:42:00.309 --> 00:42:00.319 align:start position:0%

that I'm happy to help um and we who

the report Mr chair of ought to pass um
 
00:43:13.470 --> 00:43:13.480 align:start position:0%

you well well no OTP will be under I
 
00:43:18.829 --> 00:43:18.839 align:start position:0%
think there will be I mean it will be
 
00:43:21.069 --> 00:43:21.079 align:start position:0%
without recommendation but OT the OTP
 
00:43:22.589 --> 00:43:22.599 align:start position:0%
motion will go
 
00:43:27.069 --> 00:43:27.079 align:start position:0%
first um the OTP motion Mr chair
 
00:43:29.549 --> 00:43:29.559 align:start position:0%
will go first and that means that the
 
00:43:33.670 --> 00:43:33.680 align:start position:0%
first person to speak um would be uh a
 
00:43:37.630 --> 00:43:37.640 align:start position:0%
person to speak against the
 
00:43:42.870 --> 00:43:42.880 align:start position:0%
OTP motion and then uh the people in
 
00:43:48.270 --> 00:43:48.280 align:start position:0%
favor get to speak and um uh following
 
00:43:53.349 --> 00:43:53.359 align:start position:0%
what we have tried to do all along is
 
00:43:53.359 --> 00:43:55.069 align:start position:0%
what we have tried to do all along is
um

00:43:55.069 --> 00:43:55.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:43:55.079 --> 00:43:56.630 align:start position:0%
um
concentrate

00:43:56.630 --> 00:43:56.640 align:start position:0%
concentrate
 
00:44:00.390 --> 00:44:00.400 align:start position:0%
our comments um so that we have as few
 
00:44:03.670 --> 00:44:03.680 align:start position:0%
people as possible speaking on each each
 
00:44:06.790 --> 00:44:06.800 align:start position:0%
side um so that people feel the pressure
 
00:44:09.069 --> 00:44:09.079 align:start position:0%
to be cogent and
 
00:44:12.309 --> 00:44:12.319 align:start position:0%
focused and um I would hope that we
 
00:44:14.710 --> 00:44:14.720 align:start position:0%
continue that here and that we don't end
 
00:44:18.670 --> 00:44:18.680 align:start position:0%
up with uh long and painful debate that
 
00:44:21.109 --> 00:44:21.119 align:start position:0%
won't accomplish anything no I I agree
 
00:44:22.510 --> 00:44:22.520 align:start position:0%
with you there I I definitely agree with
 
00:44:24.470 --> 00:44:24.480 align:start position:0%
you there and as I understand it since
 
00:44:27.910 --> 00:44:27.920 align:start position:0%
this require this has to be a uh uh at
 
00:44:29.630 --> 00:44:29.640 align:start position:0%
least a division vote and maybe I assume
 
00:44:31.069 --> 00:44:31.079 align:start position:0%
it'll be a roll call but it has to be at
 
00:44:33.470 --> 00:44:33.480 align:start position:0%
least a division because we need 60% and
 
00:44:37.030 --> 00:44:37.040 align:start position:0%
I assume that right if it fa if if if
 
00:44:39.829 --> 00:44:39.839 align:start position:0%
the OTP fails I assume that's really the
 
00:44:42.549 --> 00:44:42.559 align:start position:0%
end of it then if the OTP fails that is
 
00:44:44.030 --> 00:44:44.040 align:start position:0%
in fact the end of it the end of it
 
00:44:45.750 --> 00:44:45.760 align:start position:0%
right that's what I thought okay all
 
00:44:48.950 --> 00:44:48.960 align:start position:0%
right um all right then next I'm going
 
00:44:53.630 --> 00:44:53.640 align:start position:0%

HB
 
00:45:18.069 --> 00:45:18.079 align:start position:0%
1248 in my mind this is there can I just
 
00:45:20.150 --> 00:45:20.160 align:start position:0%
interrupt one second is there a
 
00:45:22.950 --> 00:45:22.960 align:start position:0%
second representative Paige seconds all
 
00:45:25.150 --> 00:45:25.160 align:start position:0%
right yes uh representative Mount thank
 
00:45:28.190 --> 00:45:28.200 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair in my mind this 15-day ban
 
00:45:30.309 --> 00:45:30.319 align:start position:0%
on abortions is
 
00:45:32.589 --> 00:45:32.599 align:start position:0%
Draconian most women don't know they're
 
00:45:36.190 --> 00:45:36.200 align:start position:0%
pregnant within 15 days uh uh pregnancy
 
00:45:40.190 --> 00:45:40.200 align:start position:0%
tests are not reliable at 15 days of
 
00:45:42.670 --> 00:45:42.680 align:start position:0%
pregnancy this amounts to outlawing
 
00:45:45.470 --> 00:45:45.480 align:start position:0%
abortion in New Hampshire forcing women
 
00:45:47.829 --> 00:45:47.839 align:start position:0%
to go out of state and delaying
 
00:45:50.990 --> 00:45:51.000 align:start position:0%
necessary and needed care this is not
 
00:45:53.430 --> 00:45:53.440 align:start position:0%
what the people of New Hampshire want
 
00:45:56.589 --> 00:45:56.599 align:start position:0%
and I move itl on
 
00:45:59.630 --> 00:45:59.640 align:start position:0%

um uh representative TR would you like
 
00:50:31.150 --> 00:50:31.160 align:start position:0%
to speak to your motion yeah uh this
 
00:50:36.829 --> 00:50:36.839 align:start position:0%
bill has uh uh a large number of um
 
00:50:39.510 --> 00:50:39.520 align:start position:0%
inconsistent and inaccurate and
 
00:50:44.270 --> 00:50:44.280 align:start position:0%
conflicting um uh components to it it it
 
00:50:47.670 --> 00:50:47.680 align:start position:0%
brings in terms that are not medically
 
00:50:52.069 --> 00:50:52.079 align:start position:0%
sound um brings in practices that are
 
00:50:55.750 --> 00:50:55.760 align:start position:0%
not medically um Justified um um
 
00:50:59.030 --> 00:50:59.040 align:start position:0%
conflates the the concepts of of
 
00:51:01.430 --> 00:51:01.440 align:start position:0%
viability with the time limit that's set
 
00:51:04.109 --> 00:51:04.119 align:start position:0%
and uh I think in general goes against
 
00:51:06.430 --> 00:51:06.440 align:start position:0%
the consensus of what the people of New
 
00:51:10.390 --> 00:51:10.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um expect for uh this um
 
00:51:12.630 --> 00:51:12.640 align:start position:0%
component of their their reproductive
 
00:51:15.750 --> 00:51:15.760 align:start position:0%
choice right anyone else wish to speak
 
00:51:20.270 --> 00:51:20.280 align:start position:0%
on uh HP 1541 yes representative Greece
 
00:51:21.589 --> 00:51:21.599 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr
 
00:51:24.430 --> 00:51:24.440 align:start position:0%
chair throughout the discussion on the
 
00:51:25.990 --> 00:51:26.000 align:start position:0%
debate on this bill
 
00:51:28.710 --> 00:51:28.720 align:start position:0%
and even comments that I have heard
 
00:51:30.309 --> 00:51:30.319 align:start position:0%
there have been some misconceptions
 
00:51:32.589 --> 00:51:32.599 align:start position:0%
about what this bill actually proposes
 
00:51:34.309 --> 00:51:34.319 align:start position:0%
it is not actually there's no there's
 
00:51:37.150 --> 00:51:37.160 align:start position:0%
absolutely no restrictions on abortion
 
00:51:39.549 --> 00:51:39.559 align:start position:0%
whatsoever it's not reducing it down to
 
00:51:42.430 --> 00:51:42.440 align:start position:0%
15 weeks from 24 weeks down to 15 weeks
 
00:51:45.349 --> 00:51:45.359 align:start position:0%
that that is not in this bill at all it
 
00:51:47.789 --> 00:51:47.799 align:start position:0%
just says that a second physician would
 
00:51:50.390 --> 00:51:50.400 align:start position:0%
be in attendance to care for the baby if
 
00:51:52.230 --> 00:51:52.240 align:start position:0%
the baby should be born alive during the
 
00:51:54.990 --> 00:51:55.000 align:start position:0%
performance of an abortion now as
 
00:51:56.549 --> 00:51:56.559 align:start position:0%
represent resentative Smith pointed out
 
00:51:57.750 --> 00:51:57.760 align:start position:0%
no one's opinions are going to be
 
00:52:00.630 --> 00:52:00.640 align:start position:0%
changed by anything said here today but
 
00:52:02.230 --> 00:52:02.240 align:start position:0%
just wanted to point out that this bill
 
00:52:06.349 --> 00:52:06.359 align:start position:0%
does not restrict abortions to 15 weeks
 
00:52:07.910 --> 00:52:07.920 align:start position:0%
the second thing I wanted to point out
 
00:52:10.349 --> 00:52:10.359 align:start position:0%
is when we use the term viability with
 
00:52:12.910 --> 00:52:12.920 align:start position:0%
relation to abortion it is a very
 
00:52:12.920 --> 00:52:14.109 align:start position:0%
relation to abortion it is a very
specious

00:52:14.109 --> 00:52:14.119 align:start position:0%
specious
 
00:52:18.349 --> 00:52:18.359 align:start position:0%
argument because a baby a human baby is
 
00:52:20.470 --> 00:52:20.480 align:start position:0%
not supposed to be viable outside the
 
00:52:24.870 --> 00:52:24.880 align:start position:0%
womb at 15 weeks or 24 weeks in fact the
 
00:52:26.750 --> 00:52:26.760 align:start position:0%
normal gational period for a human baby
 
00:52:29.470 --> 00:52:29.480 align:start position:0%
is 40 weeks I confirm that with women
 
00:52:31.430 --> 00:52:31.440 align:start position:0%
who have been pregnant so speaking as a
 
00:52:34.670 --> 00:52:34.680 align:start position:0%
man and ignorant of biology um it's 40
 
00:52:37.510 --> 00:52:37.520 align:start position:0%
weeks according to to
 
00:52:40.670 --> 00:52:40.680 align:start position:0%
women so if the fact that at barely
 
00:52:42.390 --> 00:52:42.400 align:start position:0%
onethird of the way through normal
 
00:52:45.230 --> 00:52:45.240 align:start position:0%
gestation it's not able to survive
 
00:52:48.109 --> 00:52:48.119 align:start position:0%
outside the womb is a no-brainer it's
 
00:52:51.430 --> 00:52:51.440 align:start position:0%
not intended to or even
 
00:52:54.589 --> 00:52:54.599 align:start position:0%
halfway it's not intended to the fact
 
00:52:56.990 --> 00:52:57.000 align:start position:0%
that sometimes babies are born at 24
 
00:53:00.030 --> 00:53:00.040 align:start position:0%
weeks and they survive is just a
 
00:53:02.510 --> 00:53:02.520 align:start position:0%
miracle so when we use the term
 
00:53:05.150 --> 00:53:05.160 align:start position:0%
viability you're using a word that
 
00:53:09.109 --> 00:53:09.119 align:start position:0%
actually means absolutely nothing
 
00:53:11.510 --> 00:53:11.520 align:start position:0%
because it's not intended to live
 
00:53:14.349 --> 00:53:14.359 align:start position:0%
outside the safety of the womb until it
 
00:53:17.910 --> 00:53:17.920 align:start position:0%
is fully developed and ready for natural
 
00:53:20.109 --> 00:53:20.119 align:start position:0%
birth or cesarian however you want to
 
00:53:23.069 --> 00:53:23.079 align:start position:0%
come out that's all I got to say about
 
00:53:25.270 --> 00:53:25.280 align:start position:0%
that but just so you know when you use
 
00:53:26.150 --> 00:53:26.160 align:start position:0%
the word
 
00:53:30.109 --> 00:53:30.119 align:start position:0%
viability you are you you you are not
 
00:53:33.030 --> 00:53:33.040 align:start position:0%
using uh a word that means
 
00:53:36.309 --> 00:53:36.319 align:start position:0%
anything right anyone else um wish to
 
00:53:39.829 --> 00:53:39.839 align:start position:0%
speak to uh HB
 
00:53:43.789 --> 00:53:43.799 align:start position:0%
1541 okay I'll just leave it up to uh
 
00:53:45.309 --> 00:53:45.319 align:start position:0%
what was just
 
00:53:49.470 --> 00:53:49.480 align:start position:0%
said it's it's a pretty pretty common
 
00:53:53.750 --> 00:53:53.760 align:start position:0%
answer on viability it's not thank you
 
00:53:55.670 --> 00:53:55.680 align:start position:0%
all right all right any anyone else wish
