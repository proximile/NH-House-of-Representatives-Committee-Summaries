903 am before we start the first public
 
00:00:25.269 --> 00:00:25.279 align:start position:0%
hearing i just want to address
 
00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:27.760 align:start position:0%
a few things
 
00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:31.589 align:start position:0%
a few things
so

00:00:31.589 --> 00:00:31.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:32.960 align:start position:0%
with the exception of two members of
 
00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:35.360 align:start position:0%
this committee we're all in our second
 
00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:37.520 align:start position:0%
term or more we've been all the veterans
 
00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:39.200 align:start position:0%
of this body
 
00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:41.030 align:start position:0%
of this body
and

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:42.640 align:start position:0%
to those members and including myself i
 
00:00:44.709 --> 00:00:44.719 align:start position:0%
think we set a bad example for those the
 
00:00:46.229 --> 00:00:46.239 align:start position:0%
new members of
 
00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:47.440 align:start position:0%
this body and the new members of this
 
00:00:50.069 --> 00:00:50.079 align:start position:0%
committee and i just want to say that
 
00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 align:start position:0%
just to make sure there's no
 
00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:52.480 align:start position:0%
misunderstanding but the parliamentary
 
00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 align:start position:0%
rules that we all
 
00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:55.520 align:start position:0%
fall in this committee and we're in the
 
00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:56.790 align:start position:0%
fall in this committee and we're in the
house

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:56.800 align:start position:0%
house
 
00:00:58.229 --> 00:00:58.239 align:start position:0%
and a member of the committee wants to
 
00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:01.120 align:start position:0%
speak whether it's to ask a question
 
00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 align:start position:0%
or if whether we're going to discuss a
 
00:01:06.149 --> 00:01:06.159 align:start position:0%
question that's uh open in an executive
 
00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:09.040 align:start position:0%
system the member needs to be recognized
 
00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:10.640 align:start position:0%
by the chair
 
00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 align:start position:0%
if the member speaks without being
 
00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:14.080 align:start position:0%
recognized they are speaking out of
 
00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:15.030 align:start position:0%
recognized they are speaking out of
order

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:15.040 align:start position:0%
order
 
00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:17.360 align:start position:0%
and that's how a committee meeting can
 
00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 align:start position:0%
turn very chaotic very quickly
 
00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:22.400 align:start position:0%
if a member has a follow-up question
 
00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:24.400 align:start position:0%
or they wish to speak further on the
 
00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:25.590 align:start position:0%
or they wish to speak further on the
issue

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:25.600 align:start position:0%
issue
 
00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:26.390 align:start position:0%
issue
that's

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 align:start position:0%
that's
 
00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:27.510 align:start position:0%
that's
open

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:27.520 align:start position:0%
open
 
00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:28.880 align:start position:0%
they need to be recognized for a
 
00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:30.560 align:start position:0%
follow-up question when a member is
 
00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:32.069 align:start position:0%
follow-up question when a member is
recognized

00:01:32.069 --> 00:01:32.079 align:start position:0%
recognized
 
00:01:32.079 --> 00:01:33.590 align:start position:0%
recognized
and

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 align:start position:0%
it's not they're not being recognized to
 
00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 align:start position:0%
ask a question and then debate the
 
00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:38.479 align:start position:0%
question thereafter
 
00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:40.880 align:start position:0%
they need to be recognized for further
 
00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:43.429 align:start position:0%
they need to be recognized for further
discussion

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:44.960 align:start position:0%
i would say that that rule is something
 
00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:46.640 align:start position:0%
that's followed in every committee there
 
00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:48.560 align:start position:0%
should be no exception
 
00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:50.560 align:start position:0%
if someone has if a member has a
 
00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:55.280 align:start position:0%
yelling out or
 
00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 align:start position:0%
saying mr chair mr chairman mr chairman
 
00:02:00.389 --> 00:02:00.399 align:start position:0%
even that is speaking out of order
 
00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:01.840 align:start position:0%
because you have to recognize the speech
 
00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:04.240 align:start position:0%
it does interrupt
 
00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 align:start position:0%
the hearing
 
00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:07.040 align:start position:0%
i have no problem seeing the hands in
 
00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 align:start position:0%
the room i have no problem seeing the
 
00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 align:start position:0%
people on the screen
 
00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.350 align:start position:0%
people on the screen
so

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:15.680 align:start position:0%
if someone has their hand up
 
00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:18.080 align:start position:0%
and it it's at the chair's discretion to
 
00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:19.520 align:start position:0%
recognize the member which as you can
 
00:02:21.589 --> 00:02:21.599 align:start position:0%
tell i will do my best to recognize each
 
00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 align:start position:0%
member who wishes to speak
 
00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.280 align:start position:0%
but speaking out of order
 
00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:26.720 align:start position:0%
is not appropriate
 
00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:28.000 align:start position:0%
i would ask the people who are
 
00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 align:start position:0%
participating remotely
 
00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 align:start position:0%
if you have a question
 
00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 align:start position:0%
it is also sometimes a delay so please
 
00:02:36.309 --> 00:02:36.319 align:start position:0%
try to keep yourselves muted unless you
 
00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 align:start position:0%
can recognize your speech
 
00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:40.640 align:start position:0%
and if you if the member is recognized
 
00:02:42.229 --> 00:02:42.239 align:start position:0%
after they ask the question they should
 
00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:44.560 align:start position:0%
they should mute themselves before even
 
00:02:49.509 --> 00:02:49.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:51.920 align:start position:0%
i going forward i am going to strictly
 
00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:53.030 align:start position:0%
i going forward i am going to strictly
enforce

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 align:start position:0%
enforce
 
00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 align:start position:0%
that rule because i believe
 
00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:00.869 --> 00:03:00.879 align:start position:0%
it didn't set a good example i think
 
00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:02.640 align:start position:0%
that you know we're all capable better i
 
00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:03.920 align:start position:0%
know that and i think the public
 
00:03:05.589 --> 00:03:05.599 align:start position:0%
deserves better too they shouldn't watch
 
00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:06.309 align:start position:0%
deserves better too they shouldn't watch
us

00:03:06.309 --> 00:03:06.319 align:start position:0%
us
 
00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:07.760 align:start position:0%
in this committee
 
00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:09.030 align:start position:0%
in this committee
argue

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:09.040 align:start position:0%
argue
 
00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:11.200 align:start position:0%
like that amongst ourselves especially
 
00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:13.840 align:start position:0%
we're not following the problem
 
00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:14.869 align:start position:0%
we're not following the problem
so

00:03:14.869 --> 00:03:14.879 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:03:18.309 --> 00:03:18.319 align:start position:0%
and then in respect the points of order
 
00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:20.480 align:start position:0%
which when generally that point of order
 
00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:21.680 align:start position:0%
is raised
 
00:03:23.509 --> 00:03:23.519 align:start position:0%
the chairman is
 
00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:25.280 align:start position:0%
is required to address the point of
 
00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:27.200 align:start position:0%
order but the point of order is to
 
00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280 align:start position:0%
really ensure
 
00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:31.200 align:start position:0%
it's that the parliamentary rules and
 
00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:33.280 align:start position:0%
procedures being followed
 
00:03:34.869 --> 00:03:34.879 align:start position:0%
a point of order is not appropriate
 
00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:36.640 align:start position:0%
would say if a member has
 
00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:38.400 align:start position:0%
their hand up
 
00:03:40.229 --> 00:03:40.239 align:start position:0%
and they haven't been recognized raising
 
00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:41.760 align:start position:0%
a point of order about a question about
 
00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:43.840 align:start position:0%
when to submit a committee report
 
00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:47.200 align:start position:0%
is not an appropriate point of order
 
00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:48.229 align:start position:0%
is not an appropriate point of order
so

00:03:48.229 --> 00:03:48.239 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:49.680 align:start position:0%
what i would say to the point of order
 
00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:50.720 align:start position:0%
is if there's an issue with the
 
00:03:52.309 --> 00:03:52.319 align:start position:0%
procedure and i'll give a good example
 
00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:54.560 align:start position:0%
of a point of order that was appropriate
 
00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:56.080 align:start position:0%
there was a
 
00:04:00.229 --> 00:04:00.239 align:start position:0%
the first executive session we had i
 
00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:02.640 align:start position:0%
didn't actually categorize the
 
00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:04.640 align:start position:0%
announcement say the motion that was
 
00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:05.920 align:start position:0%
proper the question that was being
 
00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:08.000 align:start position:0%
presented i did not word it correctly
 
00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:10.560 align:start position:0%
representative o'hearn
 
00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:11.680 align:start position:0%
caught that
 
00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:12.789 align:start position:0%
caught that
and

00:04:12.789 --> 00:04:12.799 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:14.560 align:start position:0%
raised the point of order and said don't
 
00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:16.239 align:start position:0%
you have to do this first
 
00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:18.000 align:start position:0%
that was an appropriate point of order i
 
00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:20.560 align:start position:0%
agreed with what he said
 
00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:22.240 align:start position:0%
and that was that
 
00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:24.240 align:start position:0%
and the rule was that we corrected our
 
00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:25.350 align:start position:0%
and the rule was that we corrected our
procedure

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:25.360 align:start position:0%
procedure
 
00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:27.600 align:start position:0%
if you disagree with the point of order
 
00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:30.240 align:start position:0%
by the ruling on the point of order
 
00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:32.160 align:start position:0%
the per the procedure is not to debate
 
00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:33.600 align:start position:0%
that point of order any further the
 
00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:35.360 align:start position:0%
ruling has already been made
 
00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:36.960 align:start position:0%
there is a procedure to
 
00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:38.960 align:start position:0%
challenge that ruling i believe that
 
00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:40.960 align:start position:0%
remember raising the point order
 
00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:43.360 align:start position:0%
on how they want to go forward with that
 
00:04:45.909 --> 00:04:45.919 align:start position:0%
but what we want to do is not raise
 
00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:48.240 align:start position:0%
point of orders that do not question the
 
00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:50.800 align:start position:0%
rules of the parliamentary procedure if
 
00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:52.720 align:start position:0%
you have a question about
 
00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:54.080 align:start position:0%
you know a committee policy when you
 
00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:55.680 align:start position:0%
submit your reports
 
00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:57.120 align:start position:0%
that's not a point of order and in
 
00:04:59.510 --> 00:04:59.520 align:start position:0%
regards to the committee reports
 
00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:01.280 align:start position:0%
i'm in my second term
 
00:05:04.469 --> 00:05:04.479 align:start position:0%
i only was guided a single chairman last
 
00:05:04.479 --> 00:05:05.350 align:start position:0%
i only was guided a single chairman last
term

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:05.360 align:start position:0%
term
 
00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:07.680 align:start position:0%
the policy that the chairman who sat in
 
00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:10.800 align:start position:0%
this position prior to myself
 
00:05:13.029 --> 00:05:13.039 align:start position:0%
that policy was to submit your reports
 
00:05:15.189 --> 00:05:15.199 align:start position:0%
at the end of the day by 10 pm
 
00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:16.400 align:start position:0%
i've never
 
00:05:18.469 --> 00:05:18.479 align:start position:0%
served under any other policies now i
 
00:05:21.029 --> 00:05:21.039 align:start position:0%
understand that maybe because that was
 
00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:23.360 align:start position:0%
the prior chairman's discretion but not
 
00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:25.440 align:start position:0%
a single member had any objection to
 
00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:26.150 align:start position:0%
a single member had any objection to
that

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:26.160 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:28.800 align:start position:0%
i never heard anyone object to it
 
00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:30.800 align:start position:0%
on this committee so when i hear people
 
00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:32.800 align:start position:0%
now challenging or objecting to that
 
00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:33.830 align:start position:0%
now challenging or objecting to that
policy

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:33.840 align:start position:0%
policy
 
00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:34.960 align:start position:0%
especially the people who serve in the
 
00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:37.280 align:start position:0%
committee last year
 
00:05:38.629 --> 00:05:38.639 align:start position:0%
i'm just going to say if
 
00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:40.880 align:start position:0%
it was good enough for the chair lasting
 
00:05:41.749 --> 00:05:41.759 align:start position:0%
that policy was good enough for the
 
00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:44.240 align:start position:0%
chairman last time i would hope
 
00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:46.560 align:start position:0%
that policy is acceptable under the
 
00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:48.960 align:start position:0%
current chair i assume that no one
 
00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:50.400 align:start position:0%
would change their position just because
 
00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:51.840 align:start position:0%
the chair is a member of different
 
00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:53.430 align:start position:0%
the chair is a member of different
pockets

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:53.440 align:start position:0%
pockets
 
00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:55.120 align:start position:0%
so the reason why we want to get those
 
00:05:57.510 --> 00:05:57.520 align:start position:0%
reports in is not
 
00:05:59.670 --> 00:05:59.680 align:start position:0%
it's not meant to be given a hard time
 
00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:01.600 align:start position:0%
it's just those i need to sign off on
 
00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:03.680 align:start position:0%
order approve those reports
 
00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:05.120 align:start position:0%
sometimes you make the calendar there's
 
00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:06.880 align:start position:0%
a lot of things that happen we all have
 
00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:08.000 align:start position:0%
a lot of things
 
00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:09.840 align:start position:0%
going on in our lives
 
00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:12.000 align:start position:0%
it is a good practice to get those in
 
00:06:13.749 --> 00:06:13.759 align:start position:0%
as soon as possible they can be emailed
 
00:06:15.749 --> 00:06:15.759 align:start position:0%
to cameron so that that's something that
 
00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:16.880 align:start position:0%
can be done
 
00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:18.240 align:start position:0%
it's actually easier if you do that
 
00:06:20.629 --> 00:06:20.639 align:start position:0%
because you can then cut and paste it
 
00:06:30.309 --> 00:06:30.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:31.909 --> 00:06:31.919 align:start position:0%
we're going to begin the oh we're going
 
00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:36.240 align:start position:0%

00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:13.590 align:start position:0%
 
just

00:11:13.590 --> 00:11:13.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:15.829 --> 00:11:15.839 align:start position:0%
so we have i will say that we have a
 
00:11:17.910 --> 00:11:17.920 align:start position:0%
quorum so we can begin the public
 
00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:23.110 align:start position:0%
quorum so we can begin the public
hearing

00:11:23.110 --> 00:11:23.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:24.630 --> 00:11:24.640 align:start position:0%
one thing i just want to address too for
 
00:11:26.870 --> 00:11:26.880 align:start position:0%
the members participating at home
 
00:11:28.470 --> 00:11:28.480 align:start position:0%
for the rules that apply
 
00:11:29.910 --> 00:11:29.920 align:start position:0%
to what you can and can't do while
 
00:11:31.269 --> 00:11:31.279 align:start position:0%
sitting in your
 
00:11:32.630 --> 00:11:32.640 align:start position:0%
committee seat
 
00:11:34.550 --> 00:11:34.560 align:start position:0%
i i believe that those same rules would
 
00:11:37.350 --> 00:11:37.360 align:start position:0%
apply if you're at home so for example
 
00:11:39.350 --> 00:11:39.360 align:start position:0%
if you were sitting physically present
 
00:11:40.949 --> 00:11:40.959 align:start position:0%
in the room you would not be permitted
 
00:11:42.550 --> 00:11:42.560 align:start position:0%
to eat so if you were at if you're
 
00:11:44.150 --> 00:11:44.160 align:start position:0%
participating remotely
 
00:11:46.550 --> 00:11:46.560 align:start position:0%
i would believe that rule would extend
 
00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:47.829 align:start position:0%
i would believe that rule would extend
to

00:11:47.829 --> 00:11:47.839 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:11:50.389 --> 00:11:50.399 align:start position:0%
the members who are remote and
 
00:11:52.790 --> 00:11:52.800 align:start position:0%
for the members of the public testifying
 
00:11:54.150 --> 00:11:54.160 align:start position:0%
i would say that
 
00:11:56.949 --> 00:11:56.959 align:start position:0%
i would find that distracting but we're
 
00:11:57.990 --> 00:11:58.000 align:start position:0%
going to begin the public hearing if
 
00:11:59.590 --> 00:11:59.600 align:start position:0%
anyone has any questions we can just we
 
00:12:01.190 --> 00:12:01.200 align:start position:0%
can get those but we are
 
00:12:03.110 --> 00:12:03.120 align:start position:0%
it's 9 15 and we have nine o'clock
 
00:12:04.230 --> 00:12:04.240 align:start position:0%
public area so we're going to start the
 
00:12:07.190 --> 00:12:07.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:08.870 --> 00:12:08.880 align:start position:0%
so the chair now opens the public
 
00:12:11.110 --> 00:12:11.120 align:start position:0%
hearing for
 
00:12:33.829 --> 00:12:33.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:36.150 --> 00:12:36.160 align:start position:0%
david king yes he's here does not have
 
00:12:41.190 --> 00:12:41.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:44.710 --> 00:12:44.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:49.030 --> 00:12:49.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:51.509 --> 00:12:51.519 align:start position:0%
mr chairman um
 
00:12:54.230 --> 00:12:54.240 align:start position:0%
if i may ask brad greenland
 
00:12:56.949 --> 00:12:56.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:59.750 --> 00:12:59.760 align:start position:0%
that i don't have any options here to
 
00:13:03.030 --> 00:13:03.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:05.430 --> 00:13:05.440 align:start position:0%
mr care i can take care of that um i
 
00:13:06.949 --> 00:13:06.959 align:start position:0%
also wanted to let you know that there
 
00:13:09.269 --> 00:13:09.279 align:start position:0%
are two uh there were two members with
 
00:13:12.710 --> 00:13:12.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:14.230 --> 00:13:14.240 align:start position:0%
thank you representative i i do
 
00:13:15.670 --> 00:13:15.680 align:start position:0%
acknowledge that there's two members
 
00:13:17.430 --> 00:13:17.440 align:start position:0%
that have their hands raised i can
 
00:13:19.030 --> 00:13:19.040 align:start position:0%
address those questions but we are
 
00:13:21.509 --> 00:13:21.519 align:start position:0%
running behind schedule in respect to
 
00:13:22.790 --> 00:13:22.800 align:start position:0%
judge king who
 
00:13:24.710 --> 00:13:24.720 align:start position:0%
already tried to testify last hearing
 
00:13:27.190 --> 00:13:27.200 align:start position:0%
because we ran behind schedule i believe
 
00:13:29.110 --> 00:13:29.120 align:start position:0%
i would really want to have that as a
 
00:13:30.790 --> 00:13:30.800 align:start position:0%
respect for the judge and as a member of
 
00:13:33.030 --> 00:13:33.040 align:start position:0%
the public to let that member test that
 
00:13:35.750 --> 00:13:35.760 align:start position:0%
remember the public testify
 
00:13:54.310 --> 00:13:54.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:56.550 --> 00:13:56.560 align:start position:0%
representative is there a way to
 
00:13:56.560 --> 00:13:58.230 align:start position:0%
representative is there a way to
allow

00:13:58.230 --> 00:13:58.240 align:start position:0%
allow
 
00:14:02.470 --> 00:14:02.480 align:start position:0%
the video feed for the witness
 
00:14:05.269 --> 00:14:05.279 align:start position:0%
uh i can promote uh judge king to be a
 
00:14:07.509 --> 00:14:07.519 align:start position:0%
panelist and judge king will have the
 
00:14:09.350 --> 00:14:09.360 align:start position:0%
option of turning his video on or
 
00:14:10.870 --> 00:14:10.880 align:start position:0%
turning it off but we should be able to
 
00:14:19.750 --> 00:14:19.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:21.189 --> 00:14:21.199 align:start position:0%
and these are these are the continued
 
00:14:22.629 --> 00:14:22.639 align:start position:0%
public hearings
 
00:14:31.509 --> 00:14:31.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:33.110 --> 00:14:33.120 align:start position:0%
judge king you may need to unmute
 
00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:34.150 align:start position:0%
judge king you may need to unmute
yourself

00:14:34.150 --> 00:14:34.160 align:start position:0%
yourself
 
00:14:35.829 --> 00:14:35.839 align:start position:0%
okay am i good now
 
00:14:37.430 --> 00:14:37.440 align:start position:0%
yes thank you all right thank you very
 
00:14:39.990 --> 00:14:40.000 align:start position:0%
much uh good morning mr chairman members
 
00:14:42.069 --> 00:14:42.079 align:start position:0%
of the committee my name is david king
 
00:14:43.590 --> 00:14:43.600 align:start position:0%
i'm the administrative judge of the new
 
00:14:46.069 --> 00:14:46.079 align:start position:0%
hampshire circuit court and i i did hang
 
00:14:47.670 --> 00:14:47.680 align:start position:0%
in with you last week until about noon
 
00:14:49.030 --> 00:14:49.040 align:start position:0%
and then i had to jump on another
 
00:14:50.550 --> 00:14:50.560 align:start position:0%
meeting so thank you for this
 
00:14:52.310 --> 00:14:52.320 align:start position:0%
opportunity to come back
 
00:14:54.870 --> 00:14:54.880 align:start position:0%
in the meantime we did judge neto and i
 
00:14:57.189 --> 00:14:57.199 align:start position:0%
did submit some written testimony so i'm
 
00:14:58.870 --> 00:14:58.880 align:start position:0%
assuming that you have that and i'll hit
 
00:15:00.470 --> 00:15:00.480 align:start position:0%
some high points and then
 
00:15:02.310 --> 00:15:02.320 align:start position:0%
i'm happy to answer any questions that
 
00:15:03.750 --> 00:15:03.760 align:start position:0%
you might have
 
00:15:07.269 --> 00:15:07.279 align:start position:0%
i did sign in in opposition to the bills
 
00:15:08.949 --> 00:15:08.959 align:start position:0%
not to be difficult but we do have some
 
00:15:11.590 --> 00:15:11.600 align:start position:0%
concerns about both of them
 
00:15:13.750 --> 00:15:13.760 align:start position:0%
i was involved as were many of the
 
00:15:16.310 --> 00:15:16.320 align:start position:0%
sponsors of this bill in the senate bill
 
00:15:18.310 --> 00:15:18.320 align:start position:0%
112 committee a couple summers ago that
 
00:15:20.150 --> 00:15:20.160 align:start position:0%
senator carson shared
 
00:15:21.509 --> 00:15:21.519 align:start position:0%
and i think one of the things we talked
 
00:15:23.269 --> 00:15:23.279 align:start position:0%
a lot about was getting bail
 
00:15:25.750 --> 00:15:25.760 align:start position:0%
commissioners paid and we are in favor
 
00:15:26.949 --> 00:15:26.959 align:start position:0%
of that
 
00:15:28.790 --> 00:15:28.800 align:start position:0%
there's a fiscal note that we prepared
 
00:15:30.389 --> 00:15:30.399 align:start position:0%
that would
 
00:15:31.829 --> 00:15:31.839 align:start position:0%
estimates the
 
00:15:33.750 --> 00:15:33.760 align:start position:0%
amount that the court would have to pay
 
00:15:36.790 --> 00:15:36.800 align:start position:0%
to be about 850 000
 
00:15:38.389 --> 00:15:38.399 align:start position:0%
that's based upon the number of criminal
 
00:15:39.829 --> 00:15:39.839 align:start position:0%
cases that the circuit court and
 
00:15:41.910 --> 00:15:41.920 align:start position:0%
superior court have and an estimate of
 
00:15:44.870 --> 00:15:44.880 align:start position:0%
the number of folks who are indigent i
 
00:15:46.710 --> 00:15:46.720 align:start position:0%
do want to make this committee aware
 
00:15:48.710 --> 00:15:48.720 align:start position:0%
that there's a another bill that might
 
00:15:51.350 --> 00:15:51.360 align:start position:0%
affect that fiscal note senate bill one
 
00:15:55.269 --> 00:15:55.279 align:start position:0%
two one two two would raise the bail
 
00:15:57.829 --> 00:15:57.839 align:start position:0%
commissioner's fees from forty dollars
 
00:16:00.069 --> 00:16:00.079 align:start position:0%
to sixty five dollars
 
00:16:03.189 --> 00:16:03.199 align:start position:0%
in the event that that bill were to pass
 
00:16:04.870 --> 00:16:04.880 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note would jump to
 
00:16:08.230 --> 00:16:08.240 align:start position:0%
approximately 1.4 million dollars so i
 
00:16:09.990 --> 00:16:10.000 align:start position:0%
just wanted you to be aware and
 
00:16:11.990 --> 00:16:12.000 align:start position:0%
sensitive to the fact that that bill's
 
00:16:13.350 --> 00:16:13.360 align:start position:0%
working its way
 
00:16:15.509 --> 00:16:15.519 align:start position:0%
uh through the legislature as well the
 
00:16:17.590 --> 00:16:17.600 align:start position:0%
concerns that we have are more about the
 
00:16:18.949 --> 00:16:18.959 align:start position:0%
process for appointing bail
 
00:16:20.949 --> 00:16:20.959 align:start position:0%
commissioners and the fact that this
 
00:16:22.629 --> 00:16:22.639 align:start position:0%
bill would set up 10
 
00:16:24.710 --> 00:16:24.720 align:start position:0%
separate commissions around the state
 
00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:25.590 align:start position:0%
separate commissions around the state
each

00:16:25.590 --> 00:16:25.600 align:start position:0%
each
 
00:16:27.590 --> 00:16:27.600 align:start position:0%
staffed by at least one superior court
 
00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:28.870 align:start position:0%
staffed by at least one superior court
judge

00:16:28.870 --> 00:16:28.880 align:start position:0%
judge
 
00:16:30.230 --> 00:16:30.240 align:start position:0%
as well as a county attorney and a
 
00:16:31.670 --> 00:16:31.680 align:start position:0%
public defender
 
00:16:34.949 --> 00:16:34.959 align:start position:0%
our one of our concerns is that having a
 
00:16:37.829 --> 00:16:37.839 align:start position:0%
county attorney and or a public defender
 
00:16:39.990 --> 00:16:40.000 align:start position:0%
overseeing bail commissioners
 
00:16:43.350 --> 00:16:43.360 align:start position:0%
seems to be a bit of a conflict i heard
 
00:16:45.350 --> 00:16:45.360 align:start position:0%
some of the testimony last week that one
 
00:16:46.710 --> 00:16:46.720 align:start position:0%
of the concerns is if a bail
 
00:16:48.389 --> 00:16:48.399 align:start position:0%
commissioner for example were
 
00:16:51.829 --> 00:16:51.839 align:start position:0%
continually setting pr bail and the
 
00:16:53.350 --> 00:16:53.360 align:start position:0%
state didn't agree with that that they
 
00:16:56.150 --> 00:16:56.160 align:start position:0%
could be removed so if you had a county
 
00:16:59.030 --> 00:16:59.040 align:start position:0%
attorney who wanted to have an effect on
 
00:17:01.030 --> 00:17:01.040 align:start position:0%
how bail was set they would have an
 
00:17:02.710 --> 00:17:02.720 align:start position:0%
ability perhaps to remove that bill
 
00:17:04.870 --> 00:17:04.880 align:start position:0%
commission that seems to be
 
00:17:06.390 --> 00:17:06.400 align:start position:0%
troublesome to me
 
00:17:08.949 --> 00:17:08.959 align:start position:0%
one of the witnesses last week who was a
 
00:17:10.870 --> 00:17:10.880 align:start position:0%
bail commissioner did
 
00:17:13.669 --> 00:17:13.679 align:start position:0%
testify that in the event that the judge
 
00:17:16.150 --> 00:17:16.160 align:start position:0%
or clerk sees bail orders coming in from
 
00:17:17.750 --> 00:17:17.760 align:start position:0%
bail commissioners that appear to be
 
00:17:17.760 --> 00:17:19.029 align:start position:0%
bail commissioners that appear to be
troublesome

00:17:19.029 --> 00:17:19.039 align:start position:0%
troublesome
 
00:17:21.270 --> 00:17:21.280 align:start position:0%
judges are not shy about getting the
 
00:17:23.510 --> 00:17:23.520 align:start position:0%
bail commissioner in and speaking with
 
00:17:25.110 --> 00:17:25.120 align:start position:0%
him or her about
 
00:17:26.470 --> 00:17:26.480 align:start position:0%
those issues
 
00:17:28.150 --> 00:17:28.160 align:start position:0%
the other thing that i think
 
00:17:30.230 --> 00:17:30.240 align:start position:0%
you should understand is that it's the
 
00:17:33.029 --> 00:17:33.039 align:start position:0%
police that actually make the phone call
 
00:17:34.310 --> 00:17:34.320 align:start position:0%
typically in the middle of the night to
 
00:17:36.710 --> 00:17:36.720 align:start position:0%
the bail commissioner and our experience
 
00:17:38.390 --> 00:17:38.400 align:start position:0%
is if there are bail commissioners that
 
00:17:40.549 --> 00:17:40.559 align:start position:0%
either are not responsive
 
00:17:42.870 --> 00:17:42.880 align:start position:0%
or are not
 
00:17:45.190 --> 00:17:45.200 align:start position:0%
operating effectively
 
00:17:47.430 --> 00:17:47.440 align:start position:0%
the police stop calling them and we get
 
00:17:49.750 --> 00:17:49.760 align:start position:0%
a we get a call and we're asked to try
 
00:17:51.909 --> 00:17:51.919 align:start position:0%
to find another bail commissioner
 
00:17:53.510 --> 00:17:53.520 align:start position:0%
there was a suggestion that there's a
 
00:17:55.110 --> 00:17:55.120 align:start position:0%
there's difficulty finding bail
 
00:17:56.870 --> 00:17:56.880 align:start position:0%
commissioners we haven't really had that
 
00:17:59.590 --> 00:17:59.600 align:start position:0%
issue i appointed a couple within the
 
00:18:01.190 --> 00:18:01.200 align:start position:0%
last week or so
 
00:18:03.590 --> 00:18:03.600 align:start position:0%
um one in nashua that i remember signing
 
00:18:05.909 --> 00:18:05.919 align:start position:0%
last week and and judge neto i and i do
 
00:18:07.430 --> 00:18:07.440 align:start position:0%
that together
 
00:18:07.440 --> 00:18:08.390 align:start position:0%
that together
um

00:18:08.390 --> 00:18:08.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:18:10.470 --> 00:18:10.480 align:start position:0%
the other thing uh i guess with regard
 
00:18:11.430 --> 00:18:11.440 align:start position:0%
to the
 
00:18:13.110 --> 00:18:13.120 align:start position:0%
the issue that i'm hearing and reading
 
00:18:14.549 --> 00:18:14.559 align:start position:0%
about it with
 
00:18:16.549 --> 00:18:16.559 align:start position:0%
pr bail being said in more serious
 
00:18:18.470 --> 00:18:18.480 align:start position:0%
matters i know there are some bail
 
00:18:19.990 --> 00:18:20.000 align:start position:0%
reform bills working their way through
 
00:18:21.909 --> 00:18:21.919 align:start position:0%
the legislature as well and
 
00:18:25.430 --> 00:18:25.440 align:start position:0%
maybe those would have an effect on that
 
00:18:28.150 --> 00:18:28.160 align:start position:0%
the bill would transfer a lot of the
 
00:18:29.909 --> 00:18:29.919 align:start position:0%
administrative duties over to the
 
00:18:31.510 --> 00:18:31.520 align:start position:0%
superior court which
 
00:18:34.549 --> 00:18:34.559 align:start position:0%
would be fine with me and our staff
 
00:18:36.390 --> 00:18:36.400 align:start position:0%
but the committee should know that
 
00:18:38.710 --> 00:18:38.720 align:start position:0%
the circuit court has about 65 000
 
00:18:41.110 --> 00:18:41.120 align:start position:0%
criminal cases a year the superior court
 
00:18:43.029 --> 00:18:43.039 align:start position:0%
has about 9 500.
 
00:18:45.669 --> 00:18:45.679 align:start position:0%
so we have about 90 percent
 
00:18:48.150 --> 00:18:48.160 align:start position:0%
of the bail orders and it seems fair
 
00:18:49.350 --> 00:18:49.360 align:start position:0%
that we do
 
00:18:51.750 --> 00:18:51.760 align:start position:0%
90 of the administrative work they're
 
00:18:54.549 --> 00:18:54.559 align:start position:0%
currently 112 bail commissioners in the
 
00:18:56.870 --> 00:18:56.880 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire it's a five-year
 
00:18:56.880 --> 00:18:57.750 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire it's a five-year
term

00:18:57.750 --> 00:18:57.760 align:start position:0%
term
 
00:19:00.950 --> 00:19:00.960 align:start position:0%
so about 20 to 25 bail commissioners
 
00:19:03.190 --> 00:19:03.200 align:start position:0%
come up for renewal each year
 
00:19:06.390 --> 00:19:06.400 align:start position:0%
and we process those applications we do
 
00:19:07.990 --> 00:19:08.000 align:start position:0%
criminal record checks we make sure that
 
00:19:10.470 --> 00:19:10.480 align:start position:0%
they have a current justice of the peace
 
00:19:12.310 --> 00:19:12.320 align:start position:0%
appointment which is a prerequisite to
 
00:19:14.230 --> 00:19:14.240 align:start position:0%
being a bail commissioner
 
00:19:16.310 --> 00:19:16.320 align:start position:0%
and we issue the
 
00:19:18.870 --> 00:19:18.880 align:start position:0%
the card that they get and that work is
 
00:19:21.830 --> 00:19:21.840 align:start position:0%
done by circuit court administrator the
 
00:19:21.840 --> 00:19:24.789 align:start position:0%
done by circuit court administrator the
administration

00:19:24.789 --> 00:19:24.799 align:start position:0%
administration
 
00:19:24.799 --> 00:19:27.029 align:start position:0%
administration
um

00:19:27.029 --> 00:19:27.039 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:19:28.630 --> 00:19:28.640 align:start position:0%
another concern that we have with the
 
00:19:31.110 --> 00:19:31.120 align:start position:0%
bill is it seems to be written in such a
 
00:19:32.950 --> 00:19:32.960 align:start position:0%
way that if someone
 
00:19:35.350 --> 00:19:35.360 align:start position:0%
claims indigence that that's the wording
 
00:19:38.549 --> 00:19:38.559 align:start position:0%
in the bill then the court shall pay
 
00:19:40.870 --> 00:19:40.880 align:start position:0%
so it doesn't really seem to require
 
00:19:43.190 --> 00:19:43.200 align:start position:0%
that someone has to be indigent it just
 
00:19:45.909 --> 00:19:45.919 align:start position:0%
seems to suggest that if they say hey
 
00:19:47.909 --> 00:19:47.919 align:start position:0%
i'm indigent then the requirement is
 
00:19:49.590 --> 00:19:49.600 align:start position:0%
automatically shifted to the court and
 
00:19:51.190 --> 00:19:51.200 align:start position:0%
we have to pay
 
00:19:53.909 --> 00:19:53.919 align:start position:0%
there's no definition of indigence
 
00:19:56.070 --> 00:19:56.080 align:start position:0%
and so we have a concern that a lot of
 
00:19:57.590 --> 00:19:57.600 align:start position:0%
people would be getting
 
00:19:59.590 --> 00:19:59.600 align:start position:0%
their bail commission fees paid by the
 
00:20:01.750 --> 00:20:01.760 align:start position:0%
state when perhaps they weren't
 
00:20:03.990 --> 00:20:04.000 align:start position:0%
uh in a position where they that they
 
00:20:05.669 --> 00:20:05.679 align:start position:0%
may have been able to pay the
 
00:20:08.549 --> 00:20:08.559 align:start position:0%
the fee and that they weren't indigent
 
00:20:10.230 --> 00:20:10.240 align:start position:0%
there was also a suggestion that the
 
00:20:12.710 --> 00:20:12.720 align:start position:0%
office of cost containment could pay the
 
00:20:14.950 --> 00:20:14.960 align:start position:0%
fees and we've explained in the written
 
00:20:17.590 --> 00:20:17.600 align:start position:0%
materials that we sent in last week that
 
00:20:20.230 --> 00:20:20.240 align:start position:0%
that's not the way occ works we would
 
00:20:22.710 --> 00:20:22.720 align:start position:0%
have to pay the bail commissioner fee
 
00:20:24.870 --> 00:20:24.880 align:start position:0%
they would have to be enabling language
 
00:20:27.270 --> 00:20:27.280 align:start position:0%
or rules to transfer the responsibility
 
00:20:29.430 --> 00:20:29.440 align:start position:0%
to recoup that to occ
 
00:20:31.510 --> 00:20:31.520 align:start position:0%
and then they would get the money back
 
00:20:32.789 --> 00:20:32.799 align:start position:0%
into their funds which would go to the
 
00:20:34.390 --> 00:20:34.400 align:start position:0%
general fund so they wouldn't pay the
 
00:20:36.390 --> 00:20:36.400 align:start position:0%
fees in the first instance it would be
 
00:20:38.470 --> 00:20:38.480 align:start position:0%
on the court to do that
 
00:20:41.750 --> 00:20:41.760 align:start position:0%
and with regard to house bill 469
 
00:20:43.510 --> 00:20:43.520 align:start position:0%
if you shorten the term of the bill
 
00:20:45.750 --> 00:20:45.760 align:start position:0%
commissioners to two years as opposed to
 
00:20:45.760 --> 00:20:46.789 align:start position:0%
commissioners to two years as opposed to
five

00:20:46.789 --> 00:20:46.799 align:start position:0%
five
 
00:20:48.789 --> 00:20:48.799 align:start position:0%
you basically have increased the work by
 
00:20:50.310 --> 00:20:50.320 align:start position:0%
two and a half times because we'll have
 
00:20:52.390 --> 00:20:52.400 align:start position:0%
to go through that process every two
 
00:20:52.400 --> 00:20:53.270 align:start position:0%
to go through that process every two
years

00:20:53.270 --> 00:20:53.280 align:start position:0%
years
 
00:20:55.669 --> 00:20:55.679 align:start position:0%
instead of every five years
 
00:20:57.510 --> 00:20:57.520 align:start position:0%
i think the five-year term was chosen
 
00:20:59.350 --> 00:20:59.360 align:start position:0%
because it coincides with the length of
 
00:21:00.830 --> 00:21:00.840 align:start position:0%
time that the
 
00:21:00.840 --> 00:21:02.710 align:start position:0%
time that the
jp

00:21:02.710 --> 00:21:02.720 align:start position:0%
jp
 
00:21:04.630 --> 00:21:04.640 align:start position:0%
runs and it seemed to make sense to have
 
00:21:06.230 --> 00:21:06.240 align:start position:0%
a five-year term
 
00:21:08.390 --> 00:21:08.400 align:start position:0%
we do and have removed bail
 
00:21:10.710 --> 00:21:10.720 align:start position:0%
commissioners for doing
 
00:21:12.470 --> 00:21:12.480 align:start position:0%
um things that are inappropriate in the
 
00:21:14.230 --> 00:21:14.240 align:start position:0%
past so we have the ability to do that
 
00:21:16.549 --> 00:21:16.559 align:start position:0%
and take them off the list and as i said
 
00:21:17.990 --> 00:21:18.000 align:start position:0%
if they're not effective or they're not
 
00:21:20.149 --> 00:21:20.159 align:start position:0%
responsive they just don't get called by
 
00:21:22.710 --> 00:21:22.720 align:start position:0%
the police so i think those are our
 
00:21:24.630 --> 00:21:24.640 align:start position:0%
concerns i'm happy to answer any
 
00:21:25.990 --> 00:21:26.000 align:start position:0%
questions that the committee has and
 
00:21:35.510 --> 00:21:35.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:40.149 --> 00:21:40.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:42.070 --> 00:21:42.080 align:start position:0%
right here
 
00:21:46.490 --> 00:21:46.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:46.500 --> 00:21:50.630 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

00:21:50.630 --> 00:21:50.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:52.870 --> 00:21:52.880 align:start position:0%
okay thank you thank you for uh taking
 
00:21:55.750 --> 00:21:55.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:57.430 --> 00:21:57.440 align:start position:0%
so when a
 
00:21:59.110 --> 00:21:59.120 align:start position:0%
person is
 
00:22:01.270 --> 00:22:01.280 align:start position:0%
brought in by the police
 
00:22:02.710 --> 00:22:02.720 align:start position:0%
and they call the
 
00:22:05.350 --> 00:22:05.360 align:start position:0%
the bail people
 
00:22:07.430 --> 00:22:07.440 align:start position:0%
do they always check
 
00:22:07.440 --> 00:22:08.549 align:start position:0%
do they always check
with

00:22:08.549 --> 00:22:08.559 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:22:10.870 --> 00:22:10.880 align:start position:0%
you know you or one of the judges
 
00:22:15.110 --> 00:22:15.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:15.990 --> 00:22:16.000 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
00:22:17.830 --> 00:22:17.840 align:start position:0%
representative no they they never check
 
00:22:20.390 --> 00:22:20.400 align:start position:0%
with us before the bail is set they are
 
00:22:23.750 --> 00:22:23.760 align:start position:0%
quasi judicial officers and they are
 
00:22:25.990 --> 00:22:26.000 align:start position:0%
empowered by virtue of their appointment
 
00:22:27.510 --> 00:22:27.520 align:start position:0%
to make those
 
00:22:29.270 --> 00:22:29.280 align:start position:0%
bail determinations
 
00:22:30.710 --> 00:22:30.720 align:start position:0%
on their own
 
00:22:33.270 --> 00:22:33.280 align:start position:0%
so typically the calls are
 
00:22:35.029 --> 00:22:35.039 align:start position:0%
not during court hours if it's during
 
00:22:36.710 --> 00:22:36.720 align:start position:0%
court hours the police would generally
 
00:22:38.950 --> 00:22:38.960 align:start position:0%
bring the person to the courthouse to be
 
00:22:41.190 --> 00:22:41.200 align:start position:0%
bailed so the call comes in let's say a
 
00:22:41.200 --> 00:22:42.230 align:start position:0%
bailed so the call comes in let's say a
midnight

00:22:42.230 --> 00:22:42.240 align:start position:0%
midnight
 
00:22:44.470 --> 00:22:44.480 align:start position:0%
and the bail commissioner
 
00:22:47.510 --> 00:22:47.520 align:start position:0%
speaks with the state the police officer
 
00:22:49.270 --> 00:22:49.280 align:start position:0%
interviews the defendant and makes a
 
00:22:52.070 --> 00:22:52.080 align:start position:0%
decision about whether the person
 
00:22:54.070 --> 00:22:54.080 align:start position:0%
is a danger to themselves or others or a
 
00:22:56.230 --> 00:22:56.240 align:start position:0%
flight risk and if not typically we'll
 
00:22:57.750 --> 00:22:57.760 align:start position:0%
set pr bail
 
00:22:59.510 --> 00:22:59.520 align:start position:0%
and then there's a review process in the
 
00:23:02.549 --> 00:23:02.559 align:start position:0%
court if someone's not satisfied with
 
00:23:03.909 --> 00:23:03.919 align:start position:0%
the bail that was set by the bail
 
00:23:05.750 --> 00:23:05.760 align:start position:0%
commissioner but it's they act on their
 
00:23:08.549 --> 00:23:08.559 align:start position:0%
own once they're appointed
 
00:23:13.750 --> 00:23:13.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:21.270 --> 00:23:21.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:24.310 --> 00:23:24.320 align:start position:0%
all right thank you mr chairman
 
00:23:27.190 --> 00:23:27.200 align:start position:0%
uh judge you mentioned that you had a
 
00:23:28.710 --> 00:23:28.720 align:start position:0%
problem i think with the bail
 
00:23:30.950 --> 00:23:30.960 align:start position:0%
commissions and maybe how they worked
 
00:23:33.110 --> 00:23:33.120 align:start position:0%
and maybe the number of them
 
00:23:34.390 --> 00:23:34.400 align:start position:0%
and you had
 
00:23:36.710 --> 00:23:36.720 align:start position:0%
concerns about five years doubling uh
 
00:23:39.669 --> 00:23:39.679 align:start position:0%
two and a half times the uh the work
 
00:23:41.990 --> 00:23:42.000 align:start position:0%
if we shorten the term
 
00:23:44.230 --> 00:23:44.240 align:start position:0%
and i also think i remember you're
 
00:23:45.990 --> 00:23:46.000 align:start position:0%
saying that you have an issue of the
 
00:23:48.070 --> 00:23:48.080 align:start position:0%
shall pay issue
 
00:23:50.470 --> 00:23:50.480 align:start position:0%
and how the payment of incident
 
00:23:53.669 --> 00:23:53.679 align:start position:0%
indigent people are paid without proof
 
00:23:57.029 --> 00:23:57.039 align:start position:0%
if those items were modified or removed
 
00:23:57.039 --> 00:23:57.909 align:start position:0%
if those items were modified or removed
um

00:23:57.909 --> 00:23:57.919 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:23:59.270 --> 00:23:59.280 align:start position:0%
would then
 
00:24:01.029 --> 00:24:01.039 align:start position:0%
you still be opposed to the bill or do
 
00:24:02.390 --> 00:24:02.400 align:start position:0%
you think that it can be approved or
 
00:24:04.230 --> 00:24:04.240 align:start position:0%
it's workable
 
00:24:06.070 --> 00:24:06.080 align:start position:0%
i think representative newman that the
 
00:24:08.630 --> 00:24:08.640 align:start position:0%
portion of the bill dealing with payment
 
00:24:10.710 --> 00:24:10.720 align:start position:0%
can be made workable
 
00:24:10.720 --> 00:24:12.310 align:start position:0%
can be made workable
um

00:24:12.310 --> 00:24:12.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:24:13.750 --> 00:24:13.760 align:start position:0%
i just don't
 
00:24:16.310 --> 00:24:16.320 align:start position:0%
want to see the court in the position of
 
00:24:19.590 --> 00:24:19.600 align:start position:0%
being required to pay a bail fee simply
 
00:24:21.990 --> 00:24:22.000 align:start position:0%
because someone says
 
00:24:24.789 --> 00:24:24.799 align:start position:0%
i'm claiming indigen they could be
 
00:24:26.789 --> 00:24:26.799 align:start position:0%
you know gainfully employed and paying
 
00:24:28.789 --> 00:24:28.799 align:start position:0%
all of their bills but if they say i
 
00:24:30.070 --> 00:24:30.080 align:start position:0%
can't pay this
 
00:24:32.710 --> 00:24:32.720 align:start position:0%
the bill seems to suggest that they
 
00:24:34.390 --> 00:24:34.400 align:start position:0%
automatically get the payment from the
 
00:24:34.400 --> 00:24:35.830 align:start position:0%
automatically get the payment from the
court

00:24:35.830 --> 00:24:35.840 align:start position:0%
court
 
00:24:37.909 --> 00:24:37.919 align:start position:0%
so and there's no definition of indigent
 
00:24:37.919 --> 00:24:38.630 align:start position:0%
so and there's no definition of indigent
so

00:24:38.630 --> 00:24:38.640 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:24:41.190 --> 00:24:41.200 align:start position:0%
we have a definition of indigency be
 
00:24:43.269 --> 00:24:43.279 align:start position:0%
before we appoint counsel
 
00:24:45.590 --> 00:24:45.600 align:start position:0%
for a defendant
 
00:24:47.269 --> 00:24:47.279 align:start position:0%
is should it be the same definition or
 
00:24:49.029 --> 00:24:49.039 align:start position:0%
should it be a lower standard we i think
 
00:24:52.630 --> 00:24:52.640 align:start position:0%
most of our judges feel that most people
 
00:24:54.310 --> 00:24:54.320 align:start position:0%
should be able to come up with forty
 
00:24:55.909 --> 00:24:55.919 align:start position:0%
dollars the bill commissioners are doing
 
00:24:58.149 --> 00:24:58.159 align:start position:0%
a huge service by getting up in the
 
00:25:00.710 --> 00:25:00.720 align:start position:0%
middle of the night and setting bail so
 
00:25:02.310 --> 00:25:02.320 align:start position:0%
that they can
 
00:25:04.390 --> 00:25:04.400 align:start position:0%
most of the time be released on their
 
00:25:06.789 --> 00:25:06.799 align:start position:0%
own recognizance and forty dollars is a
 
00:25:09.990 --> 00:25:10.000 align:start position:0%
pretty small fee to pay
 
00:25:12.310 --> 00:25:12.320 align:start position:0%
and our judges are hopefully working
 
00:25:13.990 --> 00:25:14.000 align:start position:0%
much harder to get the bail
 
00:25:16.470 --> 00:25:16.480 align:start position:0%
commissioner's fees paid now
 
00:25:18.950 --> 00:25:18.960 align:start position:0%
i know they don't always get paid and
 
00:25:20.549 --> 00:25:20.559 align:start position:0%
someone should pay them in the event
 
00:25:22.630 --> 00:25:22.640 align:start position:0%
that someone is truly unable to come up
 
00:25:25.269 --> 00:25:25.279 align:start position:0%
with the forty dollars but i think
 
00:25:27.029 --> 00:25:27.039 align:start position:0%
the legislature should at least consider
 
00:25:28.789 --> 00:25:28.799 align:start position:0%
whether you
 
00:25:31.350 --> 00:25:31.360 align:start position:0%
should tell us what indigency is whether
 
00:25:33.029 --> 00:25:33.039 align:start position:0%
it should be the same standard as a
 
00:25:35.350 --> 00:25:35.360 align:start position:0%
pointing council or should it be a lower
 
00:25:38.149 --> 00:25:38.159 align:start position:0%
standard to pay that forty dollars and
 
00:25:40.470 --> 00:25:40.480 align:start position:0%
we'd be happy to try to work with you to
 
00:25:42.149 --> 00:25:42.159 align:start position:0%
try to figure that out but the way the
 
00:25:44.230 --> 00:25:44.240 align:start position:0%
bill's worded right now i think a lot of
 
00:25:46.149 --> 00:25:46.159 align:start position:0%
people will begin will be getting a pass
 
00:25:48.710 --> 00:25:48.720 align:start position:0%
on paying their bail fee at our expense
 
00:25:50.470 --> 00:25:50.480 align:start position:0%
when they should probably be paying it
 
00:25:50.480 --> 00:25:56.549 align:start position:0%
when they should probably be paying it
themselves

00:25:56.549 --> 00:25:56.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:57.830 --> 00:25:57.840 align:start position:0%
represent you many of the follow-up
 
00:25:57.840 --> 00:26:08.549 align:start position:0%
represent you many of the follow-up
questions

00:26:08.549 --> 00:26:08.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:10.870 --> 00:26:10.880 align:start position:0%
i do i do have a follow-up i'm sorry i
 
00:26:12.950 --> 00:26:12.960 align:start position:0%
was unmuted mr chairman i was not
 
00:26:15.909 --> 00:26:15.919 align:start position:0%
anything may i have my follow-up
 
00:26:15.919 --> 00:26:18.149 align:start position:0%
anything may i have my follow-up
yes

00:26:18.149 --> 00:26:18.159 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:26:18.159 --> 00:26:19.110 align:start position:0%
yes
um

00:26:19.110 --> 00:26:19.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:26:19.120 --> 00:26:20.710 align:start position:0%
um
judge

00:26:20.710 --> 00:26:20.720 align:start position:0%
judge
 
00:26:22.710 --> 00:26:22.720 align:start position:0%
i remember an issue in the last hearing
 
00:26:24.950 --> 00:26:24.960 align:start position:0%
about the bail commissions the number of
 
00:26:24.960 --> 00:26:26.070 align:start position:0%
about the bail commissions the number of
them

00:26:26.070 --> 00:26:26.080 align:start position:0%
them
 
00:26:28.710 --> 00:26:28.720 align:start position:0%
and uh and how they could you just
 
00:26:30.230 --> 00:26:30.240 align:start position:0%
elaborate just a little bit on the
 
00:26:30.240 --> 00:26:31.510 align:start position:0%
elaborate just a little bit on the
commissions

00:26:31.510 --> 00:26:31.520 align:start position:0%
commissions
 
00:26:33.830 --> 00:26:33.840 align:start position:0%
and on the five-year versus two-year
 
00:26:33.840 --> 00:26:36.310 align:start position:0%
and on the five-year versus two-year
issue

00:26:36.310 --> 00:26:36.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:38.710 --> 00:26:38.720 align:start position:0%
okay if i understand the question
 
00:26:41.590 --> 00:26:41.600 align:start position:0%
representative newman we there are 112
 
00:26:44.149 --> 00:26:44.159 align:start position:0%
bail commissioners on the roster right
 
00:26:45.830 --> 00:26:45.840 align:start position:0%
now that service both the circuit and
 
00:26:48.470 --> 00:26:48.480 align:start position:0%
superior courts because it's a five-year
 
00:26:51.029 --> 00:26:51.039 align:start position:0%
term in their staggered appointments
 
00:26:53.430 --> 00:26:53.440 align:start position:0%
between 20 and 25 a year come up for
 
00:26:53.440 --> 00:26:55.510 align:start position:0%
between 20 and 25 a year come up for
renewal

00:26:55.510 --> 00:26:55.520 align:start position:0%
renewal
 
00:26:57.029 --> 00:26:57.039 align:start position:0%
and then we go through the process of
 
00:26:59.830 --> 00:26:59.840 align:start position:0%
that and as bail commissioners drop off
 
00:27:02.310 --> 00:27:02.320 align:start position:0%
in a region for example the monadnock
 
00:27:04.310 --> 00:27:04.320 align:start position:0%
region is now short
 
00:27:06.950 --> 00:27:06.960 align:start position:0%
mid-stream we may be asked to to round
 
00:27:08.870 --> 00:27:08.880 align:start position:0%
up a bail commissioner or two and we
 
00:27:10.470 --> 00:27:10.480 align:start position:0%
typically ask the local judges for
 
00:27:12.549 --> 00:27:12.559 align:start position:0%
recommendations because they they're in
 
00:27:14.470 --> 00:27:14.480 align:start position:0%
the communities and then we do the
 
00:27:17.430 --> 00:27:17.440 align:start position:0%
screening and make the appointments
 
00:27:21.029 --> 00:27:21.039 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure if i answer your question
 
00:27:32.230 --> 00:27:32.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:34.789 --> 00:27:34.799 align:start position:0%
seeing no questions i want to thank the
 
00:27:37.269 --> 00:27:37.279 align:start position:0%
judge for your time and your testimony
 
00:27:54.710 --> 00:27:54.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:57.430 --> 00:27:57.440 align:start position:0%
mr chairman i see nobody with their hand
 
00:27:59.830 --> 00:27:59.840 align:start position:0%
raised let me double check but i do not
 
00:27:59.840 --> 00:28:01.110 align:start position:0%
raised let me double check but i do not
no

00:28:01.110 --> 00:28:01.120 align:start position:0%
no
 
00:28:06.070 --> 00:28:06.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:07.830 --> 00:28:07.840 align:start position:0%
seeing no members of the public with
 
00:28:11.110 --> 00:28:11.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:13.190 --> 00:28:13.200 align:start position:0%
that would definitely close the public
 
00:28:16.950 --> 00:28:16.960 align:start position:0%
hearing on house bill 469
 
00:28:16.960 --> 00:28:18.710 align:start position:0%
hearing on house bill 469
and

00:28:18.710 --> 00:28:18.720 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:29:00.789 --> 00:29:00.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:03.510 --> 00:29:03.520 align:start position:0%
to the representative joel alexander who
 
00:29:05.750 --> 00:29:05.760 align:start position:0%
has had his hand raised
 
00:29:08.310 --> 00:29:08.320 align:start position:0%
we apologize for our the chair as well
 
00:29:09.750 --> 00:29:09.760 align:start position:0%
as the
 
00:29:11.190 --> 00:29:11.200 align:start position:0%
technical assistant we apologize for our
 
00:29:12.710 --> 00:29:12.720 align:start position:0%
oversight but once we close the public
 
00:29:14.470 --> 00:29:14.480 align:start position:0%
hearing it's uh
 
00:29:16.470 --> 00:29:16.480 align:start position:0%
we would have to re there's a process to
 
00:29:17.750 --> 00:29:17.760 align:start position:0%
reopen it
 
00:29:17.760 --> 00:29:18.630 align:start position:0%
reopen it
oh

00:29:18.630 --> 00:29:18.640 align:start position:0%
oh
 
00:29:20.710 --> 00:29:20.720 align:start position:0%
mr chairman the hand was not raised it
 
00:29:22.389 --> 00:29:22.399 align:start position:0%
was raised after you closed it he raised
 
00:29:24.230 --> 00:29:24.240 align:start position:0%
it well i i know but even if it even if
 
00:29:31.310 --> 00:29:31.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:31.320 --> 00:29:34.310 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

00:29:34.310 --> 00:29:34.320 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:29:36.070 --> 00:29:36.080 align:start position:0%
representative newman do you have the
 
00:29:45.750 --> 00:29:45.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:53.029 --> 00:29:53.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:55.430 --> 00:29:55.440 align:start position:0%
i'll get the mute on the unmute figured
 
00:29:56.950 --> 00:29:56.960 align:start position:0%
out here shortly
 
00:29:59.269 --> 00:29:59.279 align:start position:0%
at the time that the hearing was closed
 
00:30:02.789 --> 00:30:02.799 align:start position:0%
i had my hand up both on the screen
 
00:30:06.149 --> 00:30:06.159 align:start position:0%
and both and on the computer
 
00:30:08.789 --> 00:30:08.799 align:start position:0%
and and that's okay but i i think that
 
00:30:11.029 --> 00:30:11.039 align:start position:0%
we need to kind of smooth out the
 
00:30:13.350 --> 00:30:13.360 align:start position:0%
process of
 
00:30:15.909 --> 00:30:15.919 align:start position:0%
how you're able to recognize people that
 
00:30:18.549 --> 00:30:18.559 align:start position:0%
have their hands up should it is it most
 
00:30:31.590 --> 00:30:31.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:33.269 --> 00:30:33.279 align:start position:0%
if you have a question of how we're
 
00:30:34.630 --> 00:30:34.640 align:start position:0%
going to conduct the hearing we can do
 
00:30:34.640 --> 00:30:35.750 align:start position:0%
going to conduct the hearing we can do
that

00:30:35.750 --> 00:30:35.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:30:37.510 --> 00:30:37.520 align:start position:0%
while the hearing is not well not during
 
00:30:39.110 --> 00:30:39.120 align:start position:0%
a public hearing
 
00:30:40.789 --> 00:30:40.799 align:start position:0%
if you want to if you wish to testify on
 
00:30:41.990 --> 00:30:42.000 align:start position:0%
behalf of the bill you can sign to
 
00:30:43.510 --> 00:30:43.520 align:start position:0%
testify and do that whether you remember
 
00:30:45.029 --> 00:30:45.039 align:start position:0%
the committee or not if you're speaking
 
00:30:47.990 --> 00:30:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:51.590 --> 00:30:51.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:52.789 --> 00:30:52.799 align:start position:0%
representative newman you were not
 
00:30:54.310 --> 00:30:54.320 align:start position:0%
recognized for a follow-up question i
 
00:30:56.549 --> 00:30:56.559 align:start position:0%
opened the hearing i opened today's
 
00:30:59.350 --> 00:30:59.360 align:start position:0%
session by explaining
 
00:31:01.350 --> 00:31:01.360 align:start position:0%
that in order to ask a question or to
 
00:31:04.470 --> 00:31:04.480 align:start position:0%
speak the member must be recognized by
 
00:31:05.909 --> 00:31:05.919 align:start position:0%
the chair
 
00:31:08.389 --> 00:31:08.399 align:start position:0%
to speak if if they have a follow-up
 
00:31:11.190 --> 00:31:11.200 align:start position:0%
question the member must be recognized
 
00:31:13.510 --> 00:31:13.520 align:start position:0%
for the follow-up question that's a
 
00:31:15.990 --> 00:31:16.000 align:start position:0%
long-established parliamentary rule that
 
00:31:18.230 --> 00:31:18.240 align:start position:0%
is followed in every committee it was
 
00:31:19.750 --> 00:31:19.760 align:start position:0%
fought last year
 
00:31:21.990 --> 00:31:22.000 align:start position:0%
last term in this committee so
 
00:31:23.590 --> 00:31:23.600 align:start position:0%
i assume there's no misunderstanding
 
00:31:24.870 --> 00:31:24.880 align:start position:0%
with that i do not want to keep
 
00:31:24.880 --> 00:31:26.149 align:start position:0%
with that i do not want to keep
addressing

00:31:26.149 --> 00:31:26.159 align:start position:0%
addressing
 
00:31:32.870 --> 00:31:32.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:34.230 --> 00:31:34.240 align:start position:0%
representative knight you have a
 
00:31:34.240 --> 00:31:35.990 align:start position:0%
representative knight you have a
question

00:31:35.990 --> 00:31:36.000 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:31:38.710 --> 00:31:38.720 align:start position:0%
uh yes mr chairman with respect i have
 
00:31:41.590 --> 00:31:41.600 align:start position:0%
three so if i can pause and then ask you
 
00:31:43.909 --> 00:31:43.919 align:start position:0%
follow up there's just um
 
00:31:47.110 --> 00:31:47.120 align:start position:0%
the first one is the title for the bills
 
00:31:48.950 --> 00:31:48.960 align:start position:0%
on the on your zoom
 
00:31:50.549 --> 00:31:50.559 align:start position:0%
you just had it up and i think that's
 
00:31:52.389 --> 00:31:52.399 align:start position:0%
great i just wanted to make sure that's
 
00:31:53.990 --> 00:31:54.000 align:start position:0%
up for the public
 
00:31:55.509 --> 00:31:55.519 align:start position:0%
um so
 
00:31:56.789 --> 00:31:56.799 align:start position:0%
thank you for doing that that's not
 
00:31:58.549 --> 00:31:58.559 align:start position:0%
really a question anymore it wasn't up
 
00:32:00.230 --> 00:32:00.240 align:start position:0%
at the beginning so if i may just go
 
00:32:02.870 --> 00:32:02.880 align:start position:0%
right into my second question
 
00:32:06.070 --> 00:32:06.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:06.080 --> 00:32:06.789 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:32:06.789 --> 00:32:06.799 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:32:08.230 --> 00:32:08.240 align:start position:0%
this is how we're gonna you'll recognize
 
00:32:10.310 --> 00:32:10.320 align:start position:0%
it for the first question and it was not
 
00:32:11.830 --> 00:32:11.840 align:start position:0%
a question
 
00:32:11.840 --> 00:32:12.630 align:start position:0%
a question
so

00:32:12.630 --> 00:32:12.640 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:32:14.789 --> 00:32:14.799 align:start position:0%
again we if you're gonna if you have a

00:39:26.310 --> 00:39:26.320 align:start position:0%
the appropriate i asked i was going to
 
00:39:28.230 --> 00:39:28.240 align:start position:0%
ask the question about how to be
 
00:39:28.240 --> 00:39:29.589 align:start position:0%
ask the question about how to be
recognized

00:39:29.589 --> 00:39:29.599 align:start position:0%
recognized
 
00:39:31.430 --> 00:39:31.440 align:start position:0%
if that's inappropriate i'll wait until
 
00:39:33.270 --> 00:39:33.280 align:start position:0%
the appropriate time and i appreciate it
 
00:39:35.829 --> 00:39:35.839 align:start position:0%
if you tell me when that is
 
00:39:37.990 --> 00:39:38.000 align:start position:0%
in the executive session you would raise
 
00:39:39.750 --> 00:39:39.760 align:start position:0%
your hand if you wish to speak on the
 
00:39:42.390 --> 00:39:42.400 align:start position:0%
question that is open for discussion
 
00:39:43.829 --> 00:39:43.839 align:start position:0%
during the public hearing it's the same
 
00:39:45.829 --> 00:39:45.839 align:start position:0%
process you would raise your hand
 
00:39:47.589 --> 00:39:47.599 align:start position:0%
if you wish to ask a question of the
 
00:39:49.430 --> 00:39:49.440 align:start position:0%
witness testify
 
00:39:51.750 --> 00:39:51.760 align:start position:0%
if you want to discuss questions of
 
00:39:53.349 --> 00:39:53.359 align:start position:0%
the policies and how the committee is
 
00:39:54.950 --> 00:39:54.960 align:start position:0%
going to conduct itself
 
00:39:56.870 --> 00:39:56.880 align:start position:0%
it's the chair's position that can be
 
00:39:56.880 --> 00:39:57.990 align:start position:0%
it's the chair's position that can be
done

00:39:57.990 --> 00:39:58.000 align:start position:0%
done
 
00:40:00.950 --> 00:40:00.960 align:start position:0%
at a time that's not necessarily
 
00:40:03.190 --> 00:40:03.200 align:start position:0%
during a public hearing but if your hand
 
00:40:05.670 --> 00:40:05.680 align:start position:0%
is raised with the question
 
00:40:07.750 --> 00:40:07.760 align:start position:0%
of the witness
 
00:40:09.910 --> 00:40:09.920 align:start position:0%
you will be recognized for the question
 
00:40:11.670 --> 00:40:11.680 align:start position:0%
to question the witness
 
00:40:13.589 --> 00:40:13.599 align:start position:0%
if during the executive session if you
 
00:40:15.430 --> 00:40:15.440 align:start position:0%
have if you wish to speak or make a
 
00:40:17.270 --> 00:40:17.280 align:start position:0%
motion you can raise your hand to be
 
00:40:17.280 --> 00:40:19.910 align:start position:0%
motion you can raise your hand to be
recognized

00:40:19.910 --> 00:40:19.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:22.790 --> 00:40:22.800 align:start position:0%
may i ask a follow-up question
 
00:40:24.150 --> 00:40:24.160 align:start position:0%
representative newman i will say if you
 
00:40:25.750 --> 00:40:25.760 align:start position:0%
have a follow-up question
 
00:40:27.910 --> 00:40:27.920 align:start position:0%
rather than speaking and saying i'm just
 
00:40:29.589 --> 00:40:29.599 align:start position:0%
asking the members to simply raise their
 
00:40:31.270 --> 00:40:31.280 align:start position:0%
hand i can see
 
00:40:32.950 --> 00:40:32.960 align:start position:0%
very clearly on the screen that right in
 
00:40:34.390 --> 00:40:34.400 align:start position:0%
front of me when you raise your hand and
 
00:40:35.829 --> 00:40:35.839 align:start position:0%
i have a tv
 
00:40:37.190 --> 00:40:37.200 align:start position:0%
i would say it's about a 42 inch
 
00:40:39.670 --> 00:40:39.680 align:start position:0%
television i can also see that and on
 
00:40:41.750 --> 00:40:41.760 align:start position:0%
that tv the setting is that whoever is
 
00:40:41.760 --> 00:40:42.790 align:start position:0%
that tv the setting is that whoever is
speaking

00:40:42.790 --> 00:40:42.800 align:start position:0%
speaking
 
00:40:44.390 --> 00:40:44.400 align:start position:0%
it's enlarged so it's almost as if
 
00:40:45.750 --> 00:40:45.760 align:start position:0%
you're sitting in the room so i can see
 
00:40:47.109 --> 00:40:47.119 align:start position:0%
your hand raised
 
00:40:48.710 --> 00:40:48.720 align:start position:0%
i will recognize you for a follow-up
 
00:40:48.720 --> 00:40:49.910 align:start position:0%
i will recognize you for a follow-up
question

00:40:49.910 --> 00:40:49.920 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:40:51.910 --> 00:40:51.920 align:start position:0%
i will do that i'm just saying do not
 
00:40:54.870 --> 00:40:54.880 align:start position:0%
speak and say mr chairman and because
 
00:40:56.230 --> 00:40:56.240 align:start position:0%
that is interrupting and that is
 
00:40:57.990 --> 00:40:58.000 align:start position:0%
speaking out of order and i've already
 
00:41:01.109 --> 00:41:01.119 align:start position:0%
addressed that issue twice today already
 
00:41:02.710 --> 00:41:02.720 align:start position:0%
so if you have a follow-up question
 
00:41:03.750 --> 00:41:03.760 align:start position:0%
please raise your hand and i will
 
00:41:03.760 --> 00:41:07.829 align:start position:0%
please raise your hand and i will
recognize

00:41:07.829 --> 00:41:07.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:11.510 --> 00:41:11.520 align:start position:0%
representative newman you're recognizing
 
00:41:13.589 --> 00:41:13.599 align:start position:0%
mr chairman i understand everything you
 
00:41:15.670 --> 00:41:15.680 align:start position:0%
said today i'm not trying to delay
 
00:41:15.680 --> 00:41:16.870 align:start position:0%
said today i'm not trying to delay
anything

00:41:16.870 --> 00:41:16.880 align:start position:0%
anything
 
00:41:18.550 --> 00:41:18.560 align:start position:0%
what i
 
00:41:21.349 --> 00:41:21.359 align:start position:0%
i i know you say you can see the the
 
00:41:23.910 --> 00:41:23.920 align:start position:0%
hands and i
 
00:41:26.390 --> 00:41:26.400 align:start position:0%
twice now i've had both hands up and
 
00:41:28.870 --> 00:41:28.880 align:start position:0%
didn't get recognized maybe that was
 
00:41:30.950 --> 00:41:30.960 align:start position:0%
the discretion of the chair
 
00:41:33.270 --> 00:41:33.280 align:start position:0%
or maybe there is something missed and i
 
00:41:35.030 --> 00:41:35.040 align:start position:0%
know the technical person
 
00:41:36.870 --> 00:41:36.880 align:start position:0%
said hands were not up when they were up
 
00:41:39.109 --> 00:41:39.119 align:start position:0%
in the computer so i i would just like
 
00:41:39.119 --> 00:41:39.990 align:start position:0%
in the computer so i i would just like
to

00:41:39.990 --> 00:41:40.000 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:41:41.910 --> 00:41:41.920 align:start position:0%
figure out how to straighten that out at
 
00:41:43.910 --> 00:41:43.920 align:start position:0%
some point in the future when you tell
 
00:41:45.510 --> 00:41:45.520 align:start position:0%
me that that's appropriate
 
00:41:48.390 --> 00:41:48.400 align:start position:0%
and i appreciate your consideration and
 
00:41:50.710 --> 00:41:50.720 align:start position:0%
i think overall that this hearing i was
 
00:41:52.309 --> 00:41:52.319 align:start position:0%
just trying to help
 
00:41:54.390 --> 00:41:54.400 align:start position:0%
with smoothing out some of the processes
 
00:41:56.390 --> 00:41:56.400 align:start position:0%
of this committee and i apologize for
 
00:41:58.150 --> 00:41:58.160 align:start position:0%
that thank you
 
00:42:00.069 --> 00:42:00.079 align:start position:0%
representative newman in respect when
 
00:42:01.349 --> 00:42:01.359 align:start position:0%
your hand was raised you weren't
 
00:42:04.309 --> 00:42:04.319 align:start position:0%
recognized i did say clearly
 
00:42:06.309 --> 00:42:06.319 align:start position:0%
that i acknowledged that members had
 
00:42:07.589 --> 00:42:07.599 align:start position:0%
their hands raised but i wasn't
 
00:42:09.670 --> 00:42:09.680 align:start position:0%
recognizing them so
 
00:42:11.349 --> 00:42:11.359 align:start position:0%
i didn't mean any disrespect by not
 
00:42:12.790 --> 00:42:12.800 align:start position:0%
acknowledging you but it's not that i
 
00:42:14.390 --> 00:42:14.400 align:start position:0%
could not see your hand raised i made it
 
00:42:16.309 --> 00:42:16.319 align:start position:0%
clear to the members that they it was
 
00:42:18.630 --> 00:42:18.640 align:start position:0%
not oversight that i could actually we
 
00:42:20.550 --> 00:42:20.560 align:start position:0%
were just moving the hearing along
 
00:42:21.829 --> 00:42:21.839 align:start position:0%
and the other part i just want to point
 
00:42:24.230 --> 00:42:24.240 align:start position:0%
out if if the member understands the
 
00:42:26.630 --> 00:42:26.640 align:start position:0%
rules of being recognized and went to
 
00:42:28.470 --> 00:42:28.480 align:start position:0%
speak then i would hope that the members
 
00:42:30.950 --> 00:42:30.960 align:start position:0%
follow those tips
 
00:42:32.230 --> 00:42:32.240 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman for that
 
00:42:32.240 --> 00:42:38.390 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman for that
qualification

and
 
00:43:26.710 --> 00:43:26.720 align:start position:0%
mr chairman committee members uh the
 
00:43:28.950 --> 00:43:28.960 align:start position:0%
reason i feel ought to pass on this is
 
00:43:31.430 --> 00:43:31.440 align:start position:0%
is it is a good bill
 
00:43:31.440 --> 00:43:32.230 align:start position:0%
is it is a good bill
the

00:43:32.230 --> 00:43:32.240 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:43:35.670 --> 00:43:35.680 align:start position:0%
bail commissioners need to be paid
 
00:43:39.750 --> 00:43:39.760 align:start position:0%
i feel the courts have an avenue
 
00:43:39.760 --> 00:43:40.790 align:start position:0%
i feel the courts have an avenue
to

00:43:40.790 --> 00:43:40.800 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:43:44.230 --> 00:43:44.240 align:start position:0%
make the individuals pay this
 
00:43:44.240 --> 00:43:45.109 align:start position:0%
make the individuals pay this
um

00:43:45.109 --> 00:43:45.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:43:47.270 --> 00:43:47.280 align:start position:0%
because they can you know basically
 
00:43:49.030 --> 00:43:49.040 align:start position:0%
stiff the bail commissioner and and
 
00:43:50.470 --> 00:43:50.480 align:start position:0%
there's nothing the bail commissioner
 
00:43:51.589 --> 00:43:51.599 align:start position:0%
can do
 
00:43:51.599 --> 00:43:52.630 align:start position:0%
can do
yet

00:43:52.630 --> 00:43:52.640 align:start position:0%
yet
 
00:43:54.470 --> 00:43:54.480 align:start position:0%
you can't stiff a court
 
00:43:56.470 --> 00:43:56.480 align:start position:0%
you know if i get a speeding ticket i
 
00:43:57.829 --> 00:43:57.839 align:start position:0%
better pay that ticket because if i
 
00:43:59.030 --> 00:43:59.040 align:start position:0%
don't the port's going to come and get
 
00:43:59.040 --> 00:43:59.750 align:start position:0%
don't the port's going to come and get
me

00:43:59.750 --> 00:43:59.760 align:start position:0%
me
 
00:43:59.760 --> 00:44:01.430 align:start position:0%
me
and

00:44:01.430 --> 00:44:01.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:44:03.349 --> 00:44:03.359 align:start position:0%
you know they have a lot more different
 
00:44:05.030 --> 00:44:05.040 align:start position:0%
avenues of collecting money so that's
 
00:44:06.950 --> 00:44:06.960 align:start position:0%
why i support this bill and not to pass
 
00:44:10.710 --> 00:44:10.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:13.990 --> 00:44:14.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:15.190 --> 00:44:15.200 align:start position:0%
thank you mr
 
00:44:15.200 --> 00:44:16.150 align:start position:0%
thank you mr

um
 
00:44:18.550 --> 00:44:18.560 align:start position:0%
after listening to judge keane's uh
 
00:44:20.790 --> 00:44:20.800 align:start position:0%
testimony i
 
00:44:22.870 --> 00:44:22.880 align:start position:0%
can't support this bill
 
00:44:26.550 --> 00:44:26.560 align:start position:0%
at least as it's written today
 
00:44:29.190 --> 00:44:29.200 align:start position:0%
either it should be amended or it should
 
00:44:30.790 --> 00:44:30.800 align:start position:0%
be uh
 
00:44:34.950 --> 00:44:34.960 align:start position:0%
retained our other choice would be to
 
00:44:47.990 --> 00:44:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:50.470 --> 00:44:50.480 align:start position:0%
representative muse
 
00:44:52.390 --> 00:44:52.400 align:start position:0%

00:44:58.150 --> 00:44:58.160 align:start position:0%
the elements of the bill that deal
 
00:45:00.470 --> 00:45:00.480 align:start position:0%
specifically with uh paying bail
 
00:45:03.910 --> 00:45:03.920 align:start position:0%
commissioners uh do seem to be fixable
 
00:45:06.150 --> 00:45:06.160 align:start position:0%
uh in an amendment and i think one of
 
00:45:06.160 --> 00:45:06.870 align:start position:0%
uh in an amendment and i think one of
the

00:45:06.870 --> 00:45:06.880 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:45:08.710 --> 00:45:08.720 align:start position:0%
the frustrations of the process for all
 
00:45:10.550 --> 00:45:10.560 align:start position:0%
of us this year is going to be the fact
 
00:45:10.560 --> 00:45:11.270 align:start position:0%
of us this year is going to be the fact
that

00:45:11.270 --> 00:45:11.280 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:45:13.430 --> 00:45:13.440 align:start position:0%
we just don't have the space between
 
00:45:15.910 --> 00:45:15.920 align:start position:0%
hearings and executive sessions that
 
00:45:18.230 --> 00:45:18.240 align:start position:0%
we've had in previous years to fix
 
00:45:18.240 --> 00:45:19.270 align:start position:0%
we've had in previous years to fix
things

00:45:19.270 --> 00:45:19.280 align:start position:0%
things
 
00:45:19.280 --> 00:45:20.069 align:start position:0%
things
um

00:45:20.069 --> 00:45:20.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:45:22.950 --> 00:45:22.960 align:start position:0%
judge king did indicate a willingness to
 
00:45:24.950 --> 00:45:24.960 align:start position:0%
to work with us on specific language
 
00:45:27.109 --> 00:45:27.119 align:start position:0%
that would fix that part of the bill
 
00:45:30.309 --> 00:45:30.319 align:start position:0%
there really does seem to be a a real
 
00:45:31.589 --> 00:45:31.599 align:start position:0%
need for this
 
00:45:33.670 --> 00:45:33.680 align:start position:0%
and this actually would would solve a
 
00:45:35.990 --> 00:45:36.000 align:start position:0%
real problem uh for bill commissioners
 
00:45:37.670 --> 00:45:37.680 align:start position:0%
out there right now who are having huge
 
00:45:39.510 --> 00:45:39.520 align:start position:0%
issues with getting paid
 
00:45:39.520 --> 00:45:40.470 align:start position:0%
issues with getting paid
um

00:45:40.470 --> 00:45:40.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:45:42.069 --> 00:45:42.079 align:start position:0%
but some of the other elements of the
 
00:45:44.550 --> 00:45:44.560 align:start position:0%
bill uh as we've learned in testimony
 
00:45:47.190 --> 00:45:47.200 align:start position:0%
are pretty problematic so
 
00:45:47.200 --> 00:45:48.390 align:start position:0%
are pretty problematic so
uh

00:45:48.390 --> 00:45:48.400 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:45:50.550 --> 00:45:50.560 align:start position:0%
it's going to be very hard for me to
 
00:45:53.030 --> 00:45:53.040 align:start position:0%
support the bill in its current form
 
00:45:55.910 --> 00:45:55.920 align:start position:0%
um and i'm not sure if we have any
 
00:45:55.920 --> 00:45:57.190 align:start position:0%
um and i'm not sure if we have any
options

00:45:57.190 --> 00:45:57.200 align:start position:0%
options
 
00:45:59.109 --> 00:45:59.119 align:start position:0%
other than just simply to
 
00:46:01.829 --> 00:46:01.839 align:start position:0%
to move on the motion um but i i did
 
00:46:03.910 --> 00:46:03.920 align:start position:0%
want to note that this is not
 
00:46:06.230 --> 00:46:06.240 align:start position:0%
this is probably an issue that is going
 
00:46:08.710 --> 00:46:08.720 align:start position:0%
to keep popping up again and again
 
00:46:11.030 --> 00:46:11.040 align:start position:0%
where we have bills that normally would
 
00:46:11.040 --> 00:46:11.829 align:start position:0%
where we have bills that normally would
be

00:46:11.829 --> 00:46:11.839 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:46:13.750 --> 00:46:13.760 align:start position:0%
would be very fixable that we could act
 
00:46:13.760 --> 00:46:15.589 align:start position:0%
would be very fixable that we could act
on

00:46:15.589 --> 00:46:15.599 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:46:16.950 --> 00:46:16.960 align:start position:0%
where we may be acting on them
 
00:46:16.960 --> 00:46:23.349 align:start position:0%
where we may be acting on them
prematurely

00:46:23.349 --> 00:46:23.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:23.359 --> 00:46:25.109 align:start position:0%
 
representative

00:46:25.109 --> 00:46:25.119 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:46:26.829 --> 00:46:26.839 align:start position:0%
thank you mr
 
00:46:29.990 --> 00:46:30.000 align:start position:0%
chairman uh i do find that this bill has
 
00:46:33.190 --> 00:46:33.200 align:start position:0%
some problems in it as well
 
00:46:33.200 --> 00:46:34.309 align:start position:0%
some problems in it as well
and

00:46:34.309 --> 00:46:34.319 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:46:36.630 --> 00:46:36.640 align:start position:0%
i was kind of hoping that we would ipl
 
00:46:37.990 --> 00:46:38.000 align:start position:0%
it but
 
00:46:41.349 --> 00:46:41.359 align:start position:0%
10 i think they want 10 different
 
00:46:44.069 --> 00:46:44.079 align:start position:0%
districts to oversee this
 
00:46:47.190 --> 00:46:47.200 align:start position:0%
and i believe the judge spoke against
 
00:46:49.829 --> 00:46:49.839 align:start position:0%
that at some point or maybe it was his
 
00:46:52.390 --> 00:46:52.400 align:start position:0%
representative last time we were here
 
00:46:54.069 --> 00:46:54.079 align:start position:0%
talking about it
 
00:46:56.950 --> 00:46:56.960 align:start position:0%
i just think the bill needs some work
 
00:46:59.750 --> 00:46:59.760 align:start position:0%
and a lot of amendments so i have some
 
00:47:02.790 --> 00:47:02.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:03.990 --> 00:47:04.000 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:05.910 align:start position:0%
thank you
representative

00:47:05.910 --> 00:47:05.920 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:47:05.920 --> 00:47:07.030 align:start position:0%
representative
yeah

00:47:07.030 --> 00:47:07.040 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:47:14.280 --> 00:47:14.290 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:14.290 --> 00:47:23.109 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

00:47:23.109 --> 00:47:23.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:25.190 --> 00:47:25.200 align:start position:0%
i think could be exchanged if you just
 
00:47:28.870 --> 00:47:28.880 align:start position:0%
deleted all that just left uh
 
00:47:38.710 --> 00:47:38.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:41.030 --> 00:47:41.040 align:start position:0%
if i just may ask a question uh
 
00:47:43.109 --> 00:47:43.119 align:start position:0%
representative muse i i understand that
 
00:47:44.230 --> 00:47:44.240 align:start position:0%
there was
 
00:47:46.069 --> 00:47:46.079 align:start position:0%
at some point there was a commission
 
00:47:48.150 --> 00:47:48.160 align:start position:0%
that was
 
00:47:49.349 --> 00:47:49.359 align:start position:0%
created in
 
00:47:51.270 --> 00:47:51.280 align:start position:0%
on that commission representatives you
 
00:47:53.349 --> 00:47:53.359 align:start position:0%
remember that and i believe a lot many
 
00:47:54.390 --> 00:47:54.400 align:start position:0%
of the bills
 
00:47:55.750 --> 00:47:55.760 align:start position:0%
the sponsors is built out of that
 
00:47:56.950 --> 00:47:56.960 align:start position:0%
commission right correct when i say that
 
00:47:56.960 --> 00:47:58.790 align:start position:0%
commission right correct when i say that
representatives

00:47:58.790 --> 00:47:58.800 align:start position:0%
representatives
 
00:48:00.790 --> 00:48:00.800 align:start position:0%
that's correct
 
00:48:03.109 --> 00:48:03.119 align:start position:0%
so i i'm just now just asking a question
 
00:48:03.119 --> 00:48:03.910 align:start position:0%
so i i'm just now just asking a question
but

00:48:03.910 --> 00:48:03.920 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:48:07.829 --> 00:48:07.839 align:start position:0%
when that commission met i assume
 
00:48:07.839 --> 00:48:10.230 align:start position:0%
when that commission met i assume
that

00:48:10.230 --> 00:48:10.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:12.790 --> 00:48:12.800 align:start position:0%
was just i would judge king in
 
00:48:15.030 --> 00:48:15.040 align:start position:0%
participating in that
 
00:48:17.430 --> 00:48:17.440 align:start position:0%
those those hearings
 
00:48:17.440 --> 00:48:19.430 align:start position:0%
those those hearings
yes

00:48:19.430 --> 00:48:19.440 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:48:21.349 --> 00:48:21.359 align:start position:0%
the main focus of those hearings was
 
00:48:23.750 --> 00:48:23.760 align:start position:0%
really on how to get bail commissioners
 
00:48:25.990 --> 00:48:26.000 align:start position:0%
paid uh there were also some issues
 
00:48:28.630 --> 00:48:28.640 align:start position:0%
around uh bill commissioner training
 
00:48:30.549 --> 00:48:30.559 align:start position:0%
that we were trying to address
 
00:48:30.559 --> 00:48:31.349 align:start position:0%
that we were trying to address
uh

00:48:31.349 --> 00:48:31.359 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:48:33.589 --> 00:48:33.599 align:start position:0%
the there are some things in the bill
 
00:48:35.829 --> 00:48:35.839 align:start position:0%
you know for instance the setup of the
 
00:48:37.030 --> 00:48:37.040 align:start position:0%
of the ten
 
00:48:40.150 --> 00:48:40.160 align:start position:0%
county-wide uh uh commissions that were
 
00:48:41.270 --> 00:48:41.280 align:start position:0%
not part
 
00:48:43.589 --> 00:48:43.599 align:start position:0%
of those hearings so there's some there
 
00:48:45.430 --> 00:48:45.440 align:start position:0%
are some things in this bill
 
00:48:48.150 --> 00:48:48.160 align:start position:0%
uh that are uh that are different from
 
00:48:50.790 --> 00:48:50.800 align:start position:0%
what we talked about i um i was uh i
 
00:48:53.589 --> 00:48:53.599 align:start position:0%
decided to co-sponsor it uh because i
 
00:48:54.870 --> 00:48:54.880 align:start position:0%
thought we might we would have an
 
00:48:57.190 --> 00:48:57.200 align:start position:0%
opportunity to fix some of those things
 
00:48:58.950 --> 00:48:58.960 align:start position:0%
or address those things or ask the
 
00:48:58.960 --> 00:48:59.910 align:start position:0%
or address those things or ask the
sponsor

00:48:59.910 --> 00:48:59.920 align:start position:0%
sponsor
 
00:49:03.270 --> 00:49:03.280 align:start position:0%
uh you know a few more questions around
 
00:49:06.230 --> 00:49:06.240 align:start position:0%
what the thought was behind that so
 
00:49:06.240 --> 00:49:07.190 align:start position:0%
what the thought was behind that so
um

00:49:07.190 --> 00:49:07.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:49:09.430 --> 00:49:09.440 align:start position:0%
but i i do think that the bill in its in
 
00:49:11.510 --> 00:49:11.520 align:start position:0%
its current form
 
00:49:11.520 --> 00:49:12.470 align:start position:0%
its current form
uh

00:49:12.470 --> 00:49:12.480 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:49:14.470 --> 00:49:14.480 align:start position:0%
kind of goes above and beyond what we
 
00:49:15.910 --> 00:49:15.920 align:start position:0%
talked about in the commission in some
 
00:49:17.190 --> 00:49:17.200 align:start position:0%
respects and
 
00:49:18.710 --> 00:49:18.720 align:start position:0%
uh and
 
00:49:21.270 --> 00:49:21.280 align:start position:0%
the the whole issue of trying to get
 
00:49:21.280 --> 00:49:22.470 align:start position:0%
the the whole issue of trying to get
uh

00:49:22.470 --> 00:49:22.480 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:49:24.150 --> 00:49:24.160 align:start position:0%
trying to get bail commissioners paid i
 
00:49:26.549 --> 00:49:26.559 align:start position:0%
think what everybody wanted out of that
 
00:49:29.430 --> 00:49:29.440 align:start position:0%
was a better process for defining in
 
00:49:31.670 --> 00:49:31.680 align:start position:0%
agency and making sure that people who
 
00:49:34.710 --> 00:49:34.720 align:start position:0%
are able to pay uh were paying
 
00:49:37.030 --> 00:49:37.040 align:start position:0%
but the the problem remain and i think
 
00:49:38.710 --> 00:49:38.720 align:start position:0%
we heard testimony from one witness
 
00:49:40.309 --> 00:49:40.319 align:start position:0%
during the public hearing
 
00:49:42.549 --> 00:49:42.559 align:start position:0%
where he hasn't been able to collect
 
00:49:45.030 --> 00:49:45.040 align:start position:0%
nearly half the fees uh that he was
 
00:49:47.430 --> 00:49:47.440 align:start position:0%
eligible to collect over the last five
 
00:49:49.190 --> 00:49:49.200 align:start position:0%
years so
 
00:49:50.470 --> 00:49:50.480 align:start position:0%
there's a there's a pr there's a
 
00:49:52.870 --> 00:49:52.880 align:start position:0%
lingering problem that it would be great
 
00:49:56.390 --> 00:49:56.400 align:start position:0%
to address um and and i think we we
 
00:49:58.390 --> 00:49:58.400 align:start position:0%
tried to do that and we've been poking
 
00:50:01.109 --> 00:50:01.119 align:start position:0%
at it um and this pill probably
 
00:50:01.119 --> 00:50:02.309 align:start position:0%
at it um and this pill probably
represented

00:50:02.309 --> 00:50:02.319 align:start position:0%
represented
 
00:50:03.510 --> 00:50:03.520 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:50:05.510 --> 00:50:05.520 align:start position:0%
one of the better chances to do that but
 
00:50:07.910 --> 00:50:07.920 align:start position:0%
as we found out from judge king
 
00:50:07.920 --> 00:50:08.710 align:start position:0%
as we found out from judge king
there

00:50:08.710 --> 00:50:08.720 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:50:10.309 --> 00:50:10.319 align:start position:0%
there's some things that should be in
 
00:50:12.230 --> 00:50:12.240 align:start position:0%
the bill if we're going to do that like
 
00:50:13.589 --> 00:50:13.599 align:start position:0%
defining in
 
00:50:16.870 --> 00:50:16.880 align:start position:0%
indigency that do not appear in the bill
 
00:50:16.880 --> 00:50:17.910 align:start position:0%
indigency that do not appear in the bill
so

00:50:17.910 --> 00:50:17.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:50:20.150 --> 00:50:20.160 align:start position:0%
it makes it a little problematic to pass
 
00:50:22.069 --> 00:50:22.079 align:start position:0%
it at this point
 
00:50:23.349 --> 00:50:23.359 align:start position:0%
representative hughes may ask you a
 
00:50:23.359 --> 00:50:24.630 align:start position:0%
representative hughes may ask you a
follow-up

00:50:24.630 --> 00:50:24.640 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
00:50:26.870 --> 00:50:26.880 align:start position:0%
oh sure
 
00:50:28.710 --> 00:50:28.720 align:start position:0%
not to put you on the spot but if if
 
00:50:31.829 --> 00:50:31.839 align:start position:0%
there was an amendment that you would
 
00:50:31.839 --> 00:50:33.349 align:start position:0%
there was an amendment that you would
consider

00:50:33.349 --> 00:50:33.359 align:start position:0%
consider
 
00:50:36.470 --> 00:50:36.480 align:start position:0%
may i ask what about the bill in its
 
00:50:38.150 --> 00:50:38.160 align:start position:0%
current form
 
00:50:41.510 --> 00:50:41.520 align:start position:0%
that you would seek to amend and the
 
00:50:43.670 --> 00:50:43.680 align:start position:0%
issue with this bill just you know
 
00:50:45.910 --> 00:50:45.920 align:start position:0%
it does have an early deadline
 
00:50:45.920 --> 00:50:46.710 align:start position:0%
it does have an early deadline
so

00:50:46.710 --> 00:50:46.720 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:50:46.720 --> 00:50:47.510 align:start position:0%
so
we

00:50:47.510 --> 00:50:47.520 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:50:51.510 --> 00:50:51.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:53.349 --> 00:50:53.359 align:start position:0%
just something to keep in mind
 
00:50:54.390 --> 00:50:54.400 align:start position:0%
i would
 
00:50:55.910 --> 00:50:55.920 align:start position:0%
with that in mind i would i would
 
00:50:57.670 --> 00:50:57.680 align:start position:0%
basically strike the things that don't
 
00:50:59.030 --> 00:50:59.040 align:start position:0%
involve the payment of bail
 
00:51:01.430 --> 00:51:01.440 align:start position:0%
commissioners um and work with judge
 
00:51:04.230 --> 00:51:04.240 align:start position:0%
king to come up with uh language that
 
00:51:07.430 --> 00:51:07.440 align:start position:0%
would be uh appropriate for the court
 
00:51:09.910 --> 00:51:09.920 align:start position:0%
and uh that would uh
 
00:51:11.829 --> 00:51:11.839 align:start position:0%
result in at least that
 
00:51:13.589 --> 00:51:13.599 align:start position:0%
this one part of the issue being
 
00:51:15.349 --> 00:51:15.359 align:start position:0%
addressed um
 
00:51:17.190 --> 00:51:17.200 align:start position:0%
we had our commission meeting you know
 
00:51:18.950 --> 00:51:18.960 align:start position:0%
almost two years ago this issue with
 
00:51:21.030 --> 00:51:21.040 align:start position:0%
bill commissioners not getting paid has
 
00:51:23.510 --> 00:51:23.520 align:start position:0%
been going on for a long long time
 
00:51:23.520 --> 00:51:24.470 align:start position:0%
been going on for a long long time
and

00:51:24.470 --> 00:51:24.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:51:26.390 --> 00:51:26.400 align:start position:0%
it would be nice if we could
 
00:51:28.549 --> 00:51:28.559 align:start position:0%
find a solution to help these folks get
 
00:51:28.559 --> 00:51:33.829 align:start position:0%
find a solution to help these folks get
paid

00:51:33.829 --> 00:51:33.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:35.589 --> 00:51:35.599 align:start position:0%
thank you representatives for
 
00:51:39.589 --> 00:51:39.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:43.670 --> 00:51:43.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:47.030 --> 00:51:47.040 align:start position:0%
yes i i i agree that we should probably
 
00:51:49.510 --> 00:51:49.520 align:start position:0%
do something in in the form of some kind
 
00:51:49.520 --> 00:51:50.630 align:start position:0%
do something in in the form of some kind
of

00:51:50.630 --> 00:51:50.640 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:51:53.630 --> 00:51:53.640 align:start position:0%
amendment or other pro uh parliamentary
 
00:51:56.309 --> 00:51:56.319 align:start position:0%
procedure that would allow us to do some
 
00:51:58.150 --> 00:51:58.160 align:start position:0%
correction with this bill
 
00:52:01.430 --> 00:52:01.440 align:start position:0%
however based on the fact that we're in
 
00:52:03.349 --> 00:52:03.359 align:start position:0%
with the pandemic and
 
00:52:05.270 --> 00:52:05.280 align:start position:0%
people being remote
 
00:52:07.910 --> 00:52:07.920 align:start position:0%
and time crunching all of that i always
 
00:52:09.510 --> 00:52:09.520 align:start position:0%
support whatever could be done to do
 
00:52:11.510 --> 00:52:11.520 align:start position:0%
that but i think that
 
00:52:13.510 --> 00:52:13.520 align:start position:0%
we also really ought to try to figure
 
00:52:14.870 --> 00:52:14.880 align:start position:0%
out if there's some way to get the
 
00:52:16.390 --> 00:52:16.400 align:start position:0%
people paid
 
00:52:23.430 --> 00:52:23.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:25.270 --> 00:52:25.280 align:start position:0%
representative roy
 
00:52:26.870 --> 00:52:26.880 align:start position:0%
thank you uh
 
00:52:26.880 --> 00:52:27.750 align:start position:0%
thank you uh
i'm

00:52:27.750 --> 00:52:27.760 align:start position:0%
i'm
 
00:52:28.950 --> 00:52:28.960 align:start position:0%
here for the first part of this
 
00:52:30.150 --> 00:52:30.160 align:start position:0%
apparently but
 
00:52:31.990 --> 00:52:32.000 align:start position:0%
based on the testimony i heard from the
 
00:52:33.589 --> 00:52:33.599 align:start position:0%
judge regarding the definition of
 
00:52:35.190 --> 00:52:35.200 align:start position:0%
english yeah i would be hard-pressed to
 
00:52:36.710 --> 00:52:36.720 align:start position:0%
support this as well
 
00:52:38.870 --> 00:52:38.880 align:start position:0%
once the defense markets gets the word
 
00:52:40.230 --> 00:52:40.240 align:start position:0%
out that all you have to do is say
 
00:52:42.309 --> 00:52:42.319 align:start position:0%
you're engineering indigent there will
 
00:52:45.030 --> 00:52:45.040 align:start position:0%
be never any bail paid again
 
00:52:47.109 --> 00:52:47.119 align:start position:0%
because there's no definition so
 
00:52:47.119 --> 00:52:47.910 align:start position:0%
because there's no definition so
cool

00:52:47.910 --> 00:52:47.920 align:start position:0%
cool
 
00:52:50.630 --> 00:52:50.640 align:start position:0%
it's really problematic
 
00:52:52.230 --> 00:52:52.240 align:start position:0%
not all defense attorneys would do that
 
00:52:53.990 --> 00:52:54.000 align:start position:0%
but well
 
00:53:17.589 --> 00:53:17.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:20.150 --> 00:53:20.160 align:start position:0%
so right now we in order to introduce an
 
00:53:21.990 --> 00:53:22.000 align:start position:0%
amendment we do need to have a positive
 
00:53:22.000 --> 00:53:23.190 align:start position:0%
amendment we do need to have a positive
motion

00:53:23.190 --> 00:53:23.200 align:start position:0%
motion
 
00:53:25.349 --> 00:53:25.359 align:start position:0%
presented which we have one
 
00:53:27.910 --> 00:53:27.920 align:start position:0%
and watch it pass
 
00:53:30.630 --> 00:53:30.640 align:start position:0%
we have a deadline of february 18th
 
00:53:33.270 --> 00:53:33.280 align:start position:0%
where this needs to be
 
00:53:37.750 --> 00:53:37.760 align:start position:0%
reported we are meeting again on monday
 
00:53:39.990 --> 00:53:40.000 align:start position:0%
on february 8th
 
00:53:41.430 --> 00:53:41.440 align:start position:0%
so if
 
00:53:43.109 --> 00:53:43.119 align:start position:0%
representative music there is a
 
00:53:45.670 --> 00:53:45.680 align:start position:0%
amendment that you
 
00:53:48.390 --> 00:53:48.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:48.400 --> 00:53:50.470 align:start position:0%
 
offer

00:53:50.470 --> 00:53:50.480 align:start position:0%
offer
 
00:53:51.990 --> 00:53:52.000 align:start position:0%
i would i would say that we could we
 
00:53:55.349 --> 00:53:55.359 align:start position:0%
could suspend the executive session on
 
00:53:57.430 --> 00:53:57.440 align:start position:0%
costco 498.
 
00:53:58.549 --> 00:53:58.559 align:start position:0%
i'll give you an opportunity to get that
 
00:54:00.230 --> 00:54:00.240 align:start position:0%
amendment or if you're able to get today
 
00:54:01.829 --> 00:54:01.839 align:start position:0%
we can even reopen it
 
00:54:04.069 --> 00:54:04.079 align:start position:0%
but i wouldn't i would be
 
00:54:05.829 --> 00:54:05.839 align:start position:0%
inclined to at least suspend the
 
00:54:07.670 --> 00:54:07.680 align:start position:0%
executive session
 
00:54:07.680 --> 00:54:09.349 align:start position:0%

00:54:10.390 --> 00:54:10.400 align:start position:0%
monday
 
00:54:10.400 --> 00:54:15.349 align:start position:0%
monday
february

00:54:15.349 --> 00:54:15.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:16.790 --> 00:54:16.800 align:start position:0%
does the motion have to be withdrawn
 
00:54:16.800 --> 00:54:29.750 align:start position:0%
does the motion have to be withdrawn

00:54:31.910 --> 00:54:31.920 align:start position:0%
so the point of order is
 
00:54:34.630 --> 00:54:34.640 align:start position:0%
by representative welch is that the
 
00:54:38.470 --> 00:54:38.480 align:start position:0%

masses
 
00:58:02.950 --> 00:58:02.960 align:start position:0%
i think just so just for the record and
 
00:58:05.190 --> 00:58:05.200 align:start position:0%
the public understands when members are
 
00:58:07.990 --> 00:58:08.000 align:start position:0%
voting uh remotely they are required to
 
00:58:09.910 --> 00:58:09.920 align:start position:0%
have the video on on their electronic
 
00:58:09.920 --> 00:58:10.870 align:start position:0%
have the video on on their electronic
device

00:58:10.870 --> 00:58:10.880 align:start position:0%
device
 
00:58:12.390 --> 00:58:12.400 align:start position:0%
but i will just state to the public that
 
00:58:14.870 --> 00:58:14.880 align:start position:0%
representative testerman representative
 
00:58:16.789 --> 00:58:16.799 align:start position:0%
holden representative roy
 
00:58:18.390 --> 00:58:18.400 align:start position:0%
represent conley they're physically
 
00:58:19.670 --> 00:58:19.680 align:start position:0%
present in the room so that actually
 
00:58:22.230 --> 00:58:22.240 align:start position:0%
would not apply to those members however
 
00:58:23.589 --> 00:58:23.599 align:start position:0%
it does create a little bit of confusion
 
00:58:25.910 --> 00:58:25.920 align:start position:0%
to the public so maybe
 
00:58:27.190 --> 00:58:27.200 align:start position:0%
if you don't mind leaving the device on
 
00:58:35.750 --> 00:58:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:37.990 --> 00:58:38.000 align:start position:0%
representative knight
 
00:58:39.990 --> 00:58:40.000 align:start position:0%
hi thank you chair
 
00:58:41.510 --> 00:58:41.520 align:start position:0%
i was just a little confused so are we
 
00:58:43.670 --> 00:58:43.680 align:start position:0%
going to get an amendment for this bill
 
00:58:46.230 --> 00:58:46.240 align:start position:0%
and then um
 
00:58:50.710 --> 00:58:50.720 align:start position:0%
see that or am i that's not happening
 
00:58:50.720 --> 00:58:51.510 align:start position:0%
see that or am i that's not happening
what

00:58:51.510 --> 00:58:51.520 align:start position:0%
what
 
00:58:53.670 --> 00:58:53.680 align:start position:0%
what well i'm not going to guarantee
 
00:58:55.670 --> 00:58:55.680 align:start position:0%
that anyone's going to do anything but
 
00:58:57.910 --> 00:58:57.920 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that representative
 
00:59:01.270 --> 00:59:01.280 align:start position:0%
muse who is a co-sponsor of the bill
 
00:59:01.280 --> 00:59:02.069 align:start position:0%
muse who is a co-sponsor of the bill
uh

00:59:02.069 --> 00:59:02.079 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:59:04.630 --> 00:59:04.640 align:start position:0%
raised some concerns about his own
 
00:59:07.349 --> 00:59:07.359 align:start position:0%
about the bill itself and
 
00:59:08.870 --> 00:59:08.880 align:start position:0%
wishes to
 
00:59:10.150 --> 00:59:10.160 align:start position:0%
bring in uh
 
00:59:12.950 --> 00:59:12.960 align:start position:0%
present an amendment to this committee
 
00:59:15.190 --> 00:59:15.200 align:start position:0%
considering that we are meeting uh will
 
00:59:17.430 --> 00:59:17.440 align:start position:0%
be meeting again on monday
 
00:59:19.030 --> 00:59:19.040 align:start position:0%
february 8th
 
00:59:21.109 --> 00:59:21.119 align:start position:0%
the chair believed that it would be best
 
00:59:23.510 --> 00:59:23.520 align:start position:0%
to rather than have a bill
 
00:59:23.520 --> 00:59:24.549 align:start position:0%
to rather than have a bill
fail

00:59:24.549 --> 00:59:24.559 align:start position:0%
fail
 
00:59:24.559 --> 00:59:26.150 align:start position:0%
fail
if

00:59:26.150 --> 00:59:26.160 align:start position:0%
if
 
00:59:27.510 --> 00:59:27.520 align:start position:0%
the amendment could be brought forward
 
00:59:29.750 --> 00:59:29.760 align:start position:0%
to address some of those concerns
 
00:59:32.150 --> 00:59:32.160 align:start position:0%
i didn't see a problem doing that
 
00:59:34.150 --> 00:59:34.160 align:start position:0%
follow-up chair so we can have exec
 
00:59:35.589 --> 00:59:35.599 align:start position:0%
again on that
 
00:59:37.990 --> 00:59:38.000 align:start position:0%
representative knight
 
00:59:40.549 --> 00:59:40.559 align:start position:0%
we're going to go this one last time
 
00:59:42.710 --> 00:59:42.720 align:start position:0%
if you have a follow-up question
 
00:59:43.910 --> 00:59:43.920 align:start position:0%
you don't need to
 
00:59:46.230 --> 00:59:46.240 align:start position:0%
say speak out of order and say i have a
 
00:59:48.789 --> 00:59:48.799 align:start position:0%
follow-up question by doing that by
 
00:59:50.950 --> 00:59:50.960 align:start position:0%
simply speaking and saying i have a
 
00:59:52.470 --> 00:59:52.480 align:start position:0%
follow-up question you are speaking out
 
00:59:53.510 --> 00:59:53.520 align:start position:0%
of order
 
00:59:55.030 --> 00:59:55.040 align:start position:0%
what i ask is
 
00:59:57.109 --> 00:59:57.119 align:start position:0%
you put your hand up i can physically
 
00:59:58.789 --> 00:59:58.799 align:start position:0%
see you on two different screens at the
 
01:00:00.309 --> 01:00:00.319 align:start position:0%
same time so there's two of you in the
 
01:00:02.230 --> 01:00:02.240 align:start position:0%
room where i can see not one you're
 
01:00:03.910 --> 01:00:03.920 align:start position:0%
there and you're here
 
01:00:05.829 --> 01:00:05.839 align:start position:0%
all right so i'm not i'm trusting i can
 
01:00:07.510 --> 01:00:07.520 align:start position:0%
see you just fine
 
01:00:09.910 --> 01:00:09.920 align:start position:0%
but i don't want members speaking out of
 
01:00:12.630 --> 01:00:12.640 align:start position:0%
order if it keeps happening
 
01:00:14.069 --> 01:00:14.079 align:start position:0%
i'm gonna i'm gonna personally go down
 
01:00:15.829 --> 01:00:15.839 align:start position:0%
to the speaker's office myself and
 
01:00:17.510 --> 01:00:17.520 align:start position:0%
request that member be removed from the
 
01:00:19.190 --> 01:00:19.200 align:start position:0%
committee because we have a lot of
 
01:00:20.630 --> 01:00:20.640 align:start position:0%
important work to do
 
01:00:22.150 --> 01:00:22.160 align:start position:0%
we have a lot we have a lot of bills in
 
01:00:23.589 --> 01:00:23.599 align:start position:0%
this committee we're not gonna have time
 
01:00:25.190 --> 01:00:25.200 align:start position:0%
to get to everything because everyone
 
01:00:27.270 --> 01:00:27.280 align:start position:0%
wants to speak out of order this was not
 
01:00:29.270 --> 01:00:29.280 align:start position:0%
a problem last year in this last term in
 
01:00:31.109 --> 01:00:31.119 align:start position:0%
this committee i can't believe it's such
 
01:00:34.789 --> 01:00:34.799 align:start position:0%
a problem this this term so please
 
01:00:36.230 --> 01:00:36.240 align:start position:0%
do your best
 
01:00:38.470 --> 01:00:38.480 align:start position:0%
just raise your hand
 
01:00:40.069 --> 01:00:40.079 align:start position:0%
you will be recognized including for
 
01:00:41.430 --> 01:00:41.440 align:start position:0%
your following
 
01:00:42.309 --> 01:00:42.319 align:start position:0%
representative knight you have a
 
01:00:44.150 --> 01:00:44.160 align:start position:0%
follow-up question
 
01:00:46.390 --> 01:00:46.400 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair apologies are we
 
01:00:48.309 --> 01:00:48.319 align:start position:0%
going to exec the bill
 
01:00:52.950 --> 01:00:52.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:54.549 --> 01:00:54.559 align:start position:0%
under the
 
01:00:57.589 --> 01:00:57.599 align:start position:0%
presumption that representative muse may
 
01:00:59.510 --> 01:00:59.520 align:start position:0%
offer an amendment
 
01:01:04.470 --> 01:01:04.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:06.710 --> 01:01:06.720 align:start position:0%
representative pantalavis
 
01:01:08.390 --> 01:01:08.400 align:start position:0%
mr chairman
 
01:01:13.589 --> 01:01:13.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:16.309 --> 01:01:16.319 align:start position:0%
i certainly hope so
 
01:01:17.109 --> 01:01:17.119 align:start position:0%
it should
 
01:01:18.470 --> 01:01:18.480 align:start position:0%
what what has been happening is the
 
01:01:20.950 --> 01:01:20.960 align:start position:0%
amendment is being will be emailed
 
01:01:22.390 --> 01:01:22.400 align:start position:0%
uh wherever
 
01:01:23.910 --> 01:01:23.920 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure what representative museum
 
01:01:26.309 --> 01:01:26.319 align:start position:0%
have an opportunity to
 
01:01:26.319 --> 01:01:29.349 align:start position:0%
have an opportunity to
uh

01:01:29.349 --> 01:01:29.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:30.950 --> 01:01:30.960 align:start position:0%
speak with uh
 
01:01:32.390 --> 01:01:32.400 align:start position:0%
legislative services to obviously get
 
01:01:33.910 --> 01:01:33.920 align:start position:0%
that amendment presented to us but we
 
01:01:35.589 --> 01:01:35.599 align:start position:0%
will be able to exec
 
01:01:37.349 --> 01:01:37.359 align:start position:0%
open the executive session any point in
 
01:01:39.190 --> 01:01:39.200 align:start position:0%
time on
 
01:01:41.910 --> 01:01:41.920 align:start position:0%
the great games so if we have time to do
 
01:01:43.670 --> 01:01:43.680 align:start position:0%
it we'll we'll make sure to squeeze it
 
01:01:45.190 --> 01:01:45.200 align:start position:0%
it is up against the deadline so it
 
01:01:47.589 --> 01:01:47.599 align:start position:0%
could take priority over executive other
 
01:01:47.599 --> 01:01:58.150 align:start position:0%
could take priority over executive other
bills

01:01:58.150 --> 01:01:58.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:59.990 --> 01:02:00.000 align:start position:0%
representative muse i'm excuse me
 
01:02:04.470 --> 01:02:04.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:06.470 --> 01:02:06.480 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
01:02:09.190 --> 01:02:09.200 align:start position:0%
if if no amendment is forthcoming it's
 
01:02:11.349 --> 01:02:11.359 align:start position:0%
my understanding that we will execute
 
01:02:12.309 --> 01:02:12.319 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
01:02:15.589 --> 01:02:15.599 align:start position:0%
as usual it will resume on on monday is
 
01:02:20.309 --> 01:02:20.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:20.319 --> 01:02:21.589 align:start position:0%
 
yes

01:02:21.589 --> 01:02:21.599 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:02:22.630 --> 01:02:22.640 align:start position:0%
the reason
 
01:02:24.069 --> 01:02:24.079 align:start position:0%
i will say if no one's going to offer
 
01:02:25.430 --> 01:02:25.440 align:start position:0%
them and we might as well execute the
 
01:02:27.349 --> 01:02:27.359 align:start position:0%
bill right now we do have 25 minutes at
 
01:02:28.630 --> 01:02:28.640 align:start position:0%
the next public hearing so i would
 
01:02:29.990 --> 01:02:30.000 align:start position:0%
certainly hope
 
01:02:31.430 --> 01:02:31.440 align:start position:0%
and i trust that representative muse
 
01:02:33.270 --> 01:02:33.280 align:start position:0%
would not have
 
01:02:35.270 --> 01:02:35.280 align:start position:0%
he represented to me that he intends on
 
01:02:36.870 --> 01:02:36.880 align:start position:0%
coming forward amendment and i have no
 
01:02:38.230 --> 01:02:38.240 align:start position:0%
reason to
 
01:02:40.230 --> 01:02:40.240 align:start position:0%
think that he will not
 
01:02:42.870 --> 01:02:42.880 align:start position:0%
representative muse
 
01:02:44.630 --> 01:02:44.640 align:start position:0%
my intention is to try to get an
 
01:02:46.069 --> 01:02:46.079 align:start position:0%
amendment um
 
01:02:47.270 --> 01:02:47.280 align:start position:0%
uh worked out
 
01:02:49.750 --> 01:02:49.760 align:start position:0%
at some point today and uh to try to get
 
01:02:50.789 --> 01:02:50.799 align:start position:0%
that over
 
01:02:53.349 --> 01:02:53.359 align:start position:0%
to uh ols uh
 
01:02:56.230 --> 01:02:56.240 align:start position:0%
uh on uh on monday morning the issue is
 
01:02:58.630 --> 01:02:58.640 align:start position:0%
uh how quickly they'll be able to act on
 
01:02:59.990 --> 01:03:00.000 align:start position:0%
it um but
 
01:03:02.390 --> 01:03:02.400 align:start position:0%
if we could tentatively plan on
 
01:03:04.870 --> 01:03:04.880 align:start position:0%
executing the bill at the end of the day
 
01:03:06.069 --> 01:03:06.079 align:start position:0%
on monday
 
01:03:08.390 --> 01:03:08.400 align:start position:0%
um it may or may not give us enough time
 
01:03:10.470 --> 01:03:10.480 align:start position:0%
but i think we owe it to the folks
 
01:03:16.069 --> 01:03:16.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:17.430 --> 01:03:17.440 align:start position:0%

i understand is representative edwards
 
01:29:29.030 --> 01:29:29.040 align:start position:0%
is on the bill
 
01:29:32.310 --> 01:29:32.320 align:start position:0%
so i think he's going to speak
 
01:29:35.830 --> 01:29:35.840 align:start position:0%
you know to the bill in behalf of the uh
 
01:29:37.830 --> 01:29:37.840 align:start position:0%
representative true that is the prime
 
01:29:39.910 --> 01:29:39.920 align:start position:0%
sponsor and that's usually customary is
 
01:29:42.470 --> 01:29:42.480 align:start position:0%
that we would let them speak
 
01:29:48.149 --> 01:29:48.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:49.990 --> 01:29:50.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you
 
01:29:52.629 --> 01:29:52.639 align:start position:0%
representative bert
 
01:29:54.470 --> 01:29:54.480 align:start position:0%
representative true couldn't be here
 
01:29:56.709 --> 01:29:56.719 align:start position:0%
today so he asked me to introduce this
 
01:29:59.030 --> 01:29:59.040 align:start position:0%
bill it's already been introduced so i'd
 
01:30:01.910 --> 01:30:01.920 align:start position:0%
like to just go ahead and speak to it
 
01:30:04.790 --> 01:30:04.800 align:start position:0%
i believe that this is a
 
01:30:07.990 --> 01:30:08.000 align:start position:0%
a pro law enforcement bill
 
01:30:10.310 --> 01:30:10.320 align:start position:0%
a lot of people will see it differently
 
01:30:11.750 --> 01:30:11.760 align:start position:0%
but but
 
01:30:13.510 --> 01:30:13.520 align:start position:0%
please believe me when i say i think
 
01:30:16.070 --> 01:30:16.080 align:start position:0%
it's actually pro law enforcement this
 
01:30:17.510 --> 01:30:17.520 align:start position:0%
past year
 
01:30:19.110 --> 01:30:19.120 align:start position:0%
we've seen
 
01:30:23.030 --> 01:30:23.040 align:start position:0%
examples of excessive force
 
01:30:26.390 --> 01:30:26.400 align:start position:0%
causing great disturbance in
 
01:30:29.350 --> 01:30:29.360 align:start position:0%
violence to domestic tranquility
 
01:30:32.830 --> 01:30:32.840 align:start position:0%
and what this bill does is it looks at
 
01:30:36.070 --> 01:30:36.080 align:start position:0%
reforming uh law enforcement rules of
 
01:30:37.590 --> 01:30:37.600 align:start position:0%
engagement and
 
01:30:40.709 --> 01:30:40.719 align:start position:0%
and i i use the term rules of engagement
 
01:30:43.669 --> 01:30:43.679 align:start position:0%
when we were in afghanistan we were
 
01:30:46.149 --> 01:30:46.159 align:start position:0%
authorized to use deadly force
 
01:30:48.149 --> 01:30:48.159 align:start position:0%
but in order to use deadly force we
 
01:30:50.149 --> 01:30:50.159 align:start position:0%
needed at least three things to be true
 
01:30:52.470 --> 01:30:52.480 align:start position:0%
we needed a specific target
 
01:30:54.229 --> 01:30:54.239 align:start position:0%
we had to identify the target as a
 
01:30:56.310 --> 01:30:56.320 align:start position:0%
threat and that we had to ensure that
 
01:30:58.470 --> 01:30:58.480 align:start position:0%
there would be no collateral damage if
 
01:31:00.550 --> 01:31:00.560 align:start position:0%
we shot and missed
 
01:31:03.510 --> 01:31:03.520 align:start position:0%
so so unless those rules of engagement
 
01:31:05.189 --> 01:31:05.199 align:start position:0%
were all met
 
01:31:07.669 --> 01:31:07.679 align:start position:0%
we could not return fire
 
01:31:11.350 --> 01:31:11.360 align:start position:0%
so um so i see this bill is essentially
 
01:31:14.310 --> 01:31:14.320 align:start position:0%
rules of engagement for law enforcement
 
01:31:15.830 --> 01:31:15.840 align:start position:0%
consistent with the new hampshire
 
01:31:15.840 --> 01:31:17.189 align:start position:0%
consistent with the new hampshire
constitution

01:31:17.189 --> 01:31:17.199 align:start position:0%
constitution
 
01:31:19.270 --> 01:31:19.280 align:start position:0%
uh article 18
 
01:31:21.030 --> 01:31:21.040 align:start position:0%
that says all penalties are to be
 
01:31:23.189 --> 01:31:23.199 align:start position:0%
proportional to the offense
 
01:31:25.750 --> 01:31:25.760 align:start position:0%
and so so what what representative true
 
01:31:27.830 --> 01:31:27.840 align:start position:0%
has done in the writing of this bill
 
01:31:29.750 --> 01:31:29.760 align:start position:0%
is to say
 
01:31:32.550 --> 01:31:32.560 align:start position:0%
dear law enforcement officer if you need
 
01:31:35.990 --> 01:31:36.000 align:start position:0%
to use force to prevent the escape of
 
01:31:38.950 --> 01:31:38.960 align:start position:0%
somebody that you believe to be a threat
 
01:31:40.470 --> 01:31:40.480 align:start position:0%
to society
 
01:31:44.790 --> 01:31:44.800 align:start position:0%
you're able to do that there's no change
 
01:31:47.590 --> 01:31:47.600 align:start position:0%
however if your only goal is to make an
 
01:31:47.600 --> 01:31:48.870 align:start position:0%
however if your only goal is to make an
arrest

01:31:48.870 --> 01:31:48.880 align:start position:0%
arrest
 
01:31:51.110 --> 01:31:51.120 align:start position:0%
then you should not be using deadly
 
01:31:54.390 --> 01:31:54.400 align:start position:0%
force to affect an arrest
 
01:31:54.400 --> 01:31:55.750 align:start position:0%
force to affect an arrest
and

01:31:55.750 --> 01:31:55.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:31:58.070 --> 01:31:58.080 align:start position:0%
representative abramson i think has an
 
01:32:00.070 --> 01:32:00.080 align:start position:0%
amendment that he's going to introduce
 
01:32:01.510 --> 01:32:01.520 align:start position:0%
to this but
 
01:32:02.470 --> 01:32:02.480 align:start position:0%
i i
 
01:32:04.310 --> 01:32:04.320 align:start position:0%
i did want to explain
 
01:32:07.830 --> 01:32:07.840 align:start position:0%
um that that overview that we
 
01:32:10.629 --> 01:32:10.639 align:start position:0%
don't view this as an infringement on
 
01:32:12.470 --> 01:32:12.480 align:start position:0%
what law enforcement would do in the
 
01:32:12.480 --> 01:32:13.590 align:start position:0%
what law enforcement would do in the
field

01:32:13.590 --> 01:32:13.600 align:start position:0%
field
 
01:32:15.669 --> 01:32:15.679 align:start position:0%
other than to say
 
01:32:18.709 --> 01:32:18.719 align:start position:0%
in this excessive force scenario
 
01:32:22.070 --> 01:32:22.080 align:start position:0%
don't use force because it can cause all
 
01:32:24.950 --> 01:32:24.960 align:start position:0%
kinds of social distress
 
01:32:26.470 --> 01:32:26.480 align:start position:0%
well beyond
 
01:32:28.229 --> 01:32:28.239 align:start position:0%
um the uh
 
01:32:29.590 --> 01:32:29.600 align:start position:0%
the moment
 
01:32:32.310 --> 01:32:32.320 align:start position:0%
so uh with that i i can take some
 
01:32:35.270 --> 01:32:35.280 align:start position:0%
questions um this bill was looked at
 
01:32:38.070 --> 01:32:38.080 align:start position:0%
last year and did not pass just for what
 
01:32:43.910 --> 01:32:43.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:45.590 --> 01:32:45.600 align:start position:0%
are there any questions
 
01:32:45.600 --> 01:32:47.030 align:start position:0%
are there any questions
papa

01:32:47.030 --> 01:32:47.040 align:start position:0%

representative edwards for taking my
question

01:32:51.669 --> 01:32:51.679 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:32:53.669 --> 01:32:53.679 align:start position:0%
i don't know how well you can hear me so
 
01:32:55.189 --> 01:32:55.199 align:start position:0%
i'll speak up
 
01:32:55.199 --> 01:32:57.189 align:start position:0%
i'll speak up
um

01:32:57.189 --> 01:32:57.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:32:59.430 --> 01:32:59.440 align:start position:0%
have there been instances in new
 
01:32:59.440 --> 01:33:00.629 align:start position:0%
have there been instances in new
hampshire

01:33:00.629 --> 01:33:00.639 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
01:33:02.950 --> 01:33:02.960 align:start position:0%
where the police have used deadly force
 
01:33:05.430 --> 01:33:05.440 align:start position:0%
to apprehend somebody who was not a
 
01:33:10.470 --> 01:33:10.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:10.480 --> 01:33:11.430 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:33:11.430 --> 01:33:11.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:33:13.590 --> 01:33:13.600 align:start position:0%
that's a that's a great question
 
01:33:15.750 --> 01:33:15.760 align:start position:0%
as a co-sponsor i didn't dig into the
 
01:33:19.030 --> 01:33:19.040 align:start position:0%
side details i think i'm generally aware
 
01:33:22.790 --> 01:33:22.800 align:start position:0%
of a case about three years ago
 
01:33:25.750 --> 01:33:25.760 align:start position:0%
where uh somebody was uh
 
01:33:27.910 --> 01:33:27.920 align:start position:0%
dealing narcotics
 
01:33:30.629 --> 01:33:30.639 align:start position:0%
in in and fled the scene
 
01:33:33.270 --> 01:33:33.280 align:start position:0%
and was shot as they were fleeing
 
01:33:35.590 --> 01:33:35.600 align:start position:0%
um i
 
01:33:38.070 --> 01:33:38.080 align:start position:0%
only think that that fits your your
 
01:33:41.189 --> 01:33:41.199 align:start position:0%
description in your question but i i i
 
01:33:43.990 --> 01:33:44.000 align:start position:0%
can't tell you that as a verified truth
 
01:33:47.430 --> 01:33:47.440 align:start position:0%
i i think i think that's an example
 
01:33:50.629 --> 01:33:50.639 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:33:50.639 --> 01:33:55.590 align:start position:0%
thank you

you're muted sir
 
01:33:59.830 --> 01:33:59.840 align:start position:0%

01:33:59.840 --> 01:34:01.030 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question um
uh

01:34:01.030 --> 01:34:01.040 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:34:02.470 --> 01:34:02.480 align:start position:0%
one of the things that i'm trying to
 
01:34:04.790 --> 01:34:04.800 align:start position:0%
figure out as i look at this bill is why
 
01:34:06.310 --> 01:34:06.320 align:start position:0%
is it okay
 
01:34:07.550 --> 01:34:07.560 align:start position:0%
to shoot
 
01:34:11.030 --> 01:34:11.040 align:start position:0%
a fleeing person
 
01:34:12.950 --> 01:34:12.960 align:start position:0%
you know who
 
01:34:14.629 --> 01:34:14.639 align:start position:0%
wouldn't seem to be
 
01:34:16.830 --> 01:34:16.840 align:start position:0%
an actual threat to the life of the
 
01:34:18.629 --> 01:34:18.639 align:start position:0%
officer um
 
01:34:18.639 --> 01:34:19.350 align:start position:0%
officer um
but

01:34:19.350 --> 01:34:19.360 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:34:21.270 --> 01:34:21.280 align:start position:0%
not okay
 
01:34:21.280 --> 01:34:22.790 align:start position:0%
not okay
to

01:34:22.790 --> 01:34:22.800 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:34:26.629 --> 01:34:26.639 align:start position:0%
you know to uh you know to use force um
 
01:34:29.350 --> 01:34:29.360 align:start position:0%
when affecting an arrest i'm i'm sort of
 
01:34:31.270 --> 01:34:31.280 align:start position:0%
in in the camp where i'm not really sure
 
01:34:33.750 --> 01:34:33.760 align:start position:0%
where i see the need for either one of
 
01:34:34.870 --> 01:34:34.880 align:start position:0%
these things
 
01:34:34.880 --> 01:34:35.990 align:start position:0%
these things
um

01:34:35.990 --> 01:34:36.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:34:38.950 --> 01:34:38.960 align:start position:0%
and my other question would be
 
01:34:42.470 --> 01:34:42.480 align:start position:0%
uh the question first okay
 
01:34:45.990 --> 01:34:46.000 align:start position:0%
so i i think we're actually in agreement
 
01:34:48.550 --> 01:34:48.560 align:start position:0%
as i listen to your question uh it
 
01:34:50.790 --> 01:34:50.800 align:start position:0%
sounds to me like you're questioning
 
01:34:50.800 --> 01:34:51.830 align:start position:0%
sounds to me like you're questioning
uh

01:34:51.830 --> 01:34:51.840 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:34:54.470 --> 01:34:54.480 align:start position:0%
why use deadly force in order to arrest
 
01:34:54.480 --> 01:34:57.110 align:start position:0%
why use deadly force in order to arrest
somebody

01:34:57.110 --> 01:34:57.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:59.189 --> 01:34:59.199 align:start position:0%
and unless you think they're a threat to
 
01:35:01.030 --> 01:35:01.040 align:start position:0%
others and you're trying to prevent
 
01:35:03.430 --> 01:35:03.440 align:start position:0%
their escape you should not use deadly
 
01:35:05.189 --> 01:35:05.199 align:start position:0%
force but if you do think they are
 
01:35:07.110 --> 01:35:07.120 align:start position:0%
trying to escape
 
01:35:08.950 --> 01:35:08.960 align:start position:0%
and they are a threat to others or to
 
01:35:08.960 --> 01:35:10.070 align:start position:0%
and they are a threat to others or to
yourself

01:35:10.070 --> 01:35:10.080 align:start position:0%
yourself
 
01:35:10.080 --> 01:35:11.189 align:start position:0%
yourself
then

01:35:11.189 --> 01:35:11.199 align:start position:0%
then
 
01:35:13.750 --> 01:35:13.760 align:start position:0%
deadly force is still permitted so we're
 
01:35:16.229 --> 01:35:16.239 align:start position:0%
so we're changing from the current
 
01:35:19.590 --> 01:35:19.600 align:start position:0%
standard of affecting an arrest can lead
 
01:35:21.990 --> 01:35:22.000 align:start position:0%
to deadly force we're just removing that
 
01:35:23.430 --> 01:35:23.440 align:start position:0%
portion of it
 
01:35:26.470 --> 01:35:26.480 align:start position:0%
so so i i think you and i are in an
 
01:35:28.629 --> 01:35:28.639 align:start position:0%
agreement based on my understanding your
 
01:35:31.350 --> 01:35:31.360 align:start position:0%
question but but then i'll take a second
 
01:35:35.830 --> 01:35:35.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:40.070 --> 01:35:40.080 align:start position:0%
follow up mr chair yes further questions
 
01:35:43.270 --> 01:35:43.280 align:start position:0%
um part of the bill also repeals section
 
01:35:47.669 --> 01:35:47.679 align:start position:0%
uh rsa uh 627 uh colon five
 
01:35:50.550 --> 01:35:50.560 align:start position:0%
uh roman numeral eight that basically
 
01:35:51.990 --> 01:35:52.000 align:start position:0%
says uh
 
01:35:54.550 --> 01:35:54.560 align:start position:0%
uh if the officer reasonably believes
 
01:35:56.149 --> 01:35:56.159 align:start position:0%
that the arrest is lawful and there's no
 
01:35:58.950 --> 01:35:58.960 align:start position:0%
other means of affecting arrest
 
01:36:01.510 --> 01:36:01.520 align:start position:0%
using reasonable force
 
01:36:03.590 --> 01:36:03.600 align:start position:0%
it basically seems to
 
01:36:06.070 --> 01:36:06.080 align:start position:0%
require the officer to use a reasonable
 
01:36:07.910 --> 01:36:07.920 align:start position:0%
force if necessary and
 
01:36:09.270 --> 01:36:09.280 align:start position:0%
i'm curious
 
01:36:12.390 --> 01:36:12.400 align:start position:0%
why that portion of the of the uh of the
 
01:36:16.070 --> 01:36:16.080 align:start position:0%
rsa is eliminated from this bill
 
01:36:17.830 --> 01:36:17.840 align:start position:0%
hey that's a great question i don't know
 
01:36:21.590 --> 01:36:21.600 align:start position:0%
your answer uh i can uh ask
 
01:36:23.189 --> 01:36:23.199 align:start position:0%
representative true to get back to you
 
01:36:25.510 --> 01:36:25.520 align:start position:0%
on that though
 
01:36:26.470 --> 01:36:26.480 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:36:30.629 --> 01:36:30.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:32.229 --> 01:36:32.239 align:start position:0%
wrap it down roy
 
01:36:33.830 --> 01:36:33.840 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you
 
01:36:36.070 --> 01:36:36.080 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question
 
01:36:38.709 --> 01:36:38.719 align:start position:0%
my question is a i guess i'll put it in
 
01:36:42.310 --> 01:36:42.320 align:start position:0%
a scenario format um i'm gonna say i'm a
 
01:36:45.030 --> 01:36:45.040 align:start position:0%
police officer and i'm carrying a taser
 
01:36:46.790 --> 01:36:46.800 align:start position:0%
and i'm trying to infect arrest and the
 
01:36:49.910 --> 01:36:49.920 align:start position:0%
suspect takes my taser
 
01:36:52.870 --> 01:36:52.880 align:start position:0%
under the way this was written it says
 
01:36:54.390 --> 01:36:54.400 align:start position:0%
that i can only
 
01:36:54.400 --> 01:36:55.510 align:start position:0%
that i can only
use

01:36:55.510 --> 01:36:55.520 align:start position:0%
use
 
01:36:58.629 --> 01:36:58.639 align:start position:0%
lethal force if i believe that
 
01:37:00.709 --> 01:37:00.719 align:start position:0%
and someone's about to use deadly force
 
01:37:01.750 --> 01:37:01.760 align:start position:0%
on me
 
01:37:03.510 --> 01:37:03.520 align:start position:0%
while a taser isn't considered deadly
 
01:37:05.830 --> 01:37:05.840 align:start position:0%
force but my training experience would
 
01:37:07.910 --> 01:37:07.920 align:start position:0%
tell me that if i'm tased i'm going to
 
01:37:10.950 --> 01:37:10.960 align:start position:0%
be unable to defend myself further so is
 
01:37:13.030 --> 01:37:13.040 align:start position:0%
it the position of this bill that if
 
01:37:15.189 --> 01:37:15.199 align:start position:0%
someone were to take my taser
 
01:37:17.510 --> 01:37:17.520 align:start position:0%
or my baton
 
01:37:19.510 --> 01:37:19.520 align:start position:0%
i'm not able to deploy a firearm against
 
01:37:19.520 --> 01:37:21.510 align:start position:0%
i'm not able to deploy a firearm against
them

01:37:21.510 --> 01:37:21.520 align:start position:0%
them
 
01:37:24.550 --> 01:37:24.560 align:start position:0%
so so uh thank you for the question uh i
 
01:37:26.950 --> 01:37:26.960 align:start position:0%
think i'm neither of us are attorneys as
 
01:37:29.830 --> 01:37:29.840 align:start position:0%
i understand and so i'm looking at
 
01:37:31.990 --> 01:37:32.000 align:start position:0%
um the the
 
01:37:35.510 --> 01:37:35.520 align:start position:0%
roman numeral two b 1
 
01:37:38.550 --> 01:37:38.560 align:start position:0%
and it it's it says
 
01:37:40.310 --> 01:37:40.320 align:start position:0%
to me that the use of force is
 
01:37:44.149 --> 01:37:44.159 align:start position:0%
authorized if the uh the person
 
01:37:47.430 --> 01:37:47.440 align:start position:0%
upon which the force is exercised is
 
01:37:49.910 --> 01:37:49.920 align:start position:0%
likely to seriously endanger life or
 
01:37:52.950 --> 01:37:52.960 align:start position:0%
inflict seriously bodily injury
 
01:37:56.229 --> 01:37:56.239 align:start position:0%
so so in the scenario you painted
 
01:38:00.830 --> 01:38:00.840 align:start position:0%
uh if a perpetrator has uh
 
01:38:01.270 --> 01:38:01.280 align:start position:0%
a taser from the law enforcement officer
 
01:38:01.280 --> 01:38:04.709 align:start position:0%
a taser from the law enforcement officer
you taken

01:38:04.709 --> 01:38:04.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:07.669 --> 01:38:07.679 align:start position:0%
i i would think that uh
 
01:38:09.990 --> 01:38:10.000 align:start position:0%
reasonable people would say that that
 
01:38:13.430 --> 01:38:13.440 align:start position:0%
that perpetrator is uh is now a threat a
 
01:38:15.350 --> 01:38:15.360 align:start position:0%
serious threat
 
01:38:17.750 --> 01:38:17.760 align:start position:0%
and you salute lethal force in that
 
01:38:20.390 --> 01:38:20.400 align:start position:0%
scenario would be authorized by this
 
01:38:21.669 --> 01:38:21.679 align:start position:0%
bill by this
 
01:38:23.030 --> 01:38:23.040 align:start position:0%
bill yes
 
01:38:25.030 --> 01:38:25.040 align:start position:0%
that's my interpretation representative
 
01:38:25.040 --> 01:38:26.149 align:start position:0%
that's my interpretation representative
roy

01:38:26.149 --> 01:38:26.159 align:start position:0%
roy
 
01:38:27.350 --> 01:38:27.360 align:start position:0%
another question
 
01:38:28.709 --> 01:38:28.719 align:start position:0%
yes please
 
01:38:31.030 --> 01:38:31.040 align:start position:0%
thank you representative i'm incorrect
 
01:38:33.270 --> 01:38:33.280 align:start position:0%
neither of us are lawyers however i was
 
01:38:35.750 --> 01:38:35.760 align:start position:0%
i was a law enforcement officer and i
 
01:38:37.270 --> 01:38:37.280 align:start position:0%
have a little bit of experience in this
 
01:38:39.510 --> 01:38:39.520 align:start position:0%
arena the the
 
01:38:41.109 --> 01:38:41.119 align:start position:0%
one of the arguments law enforcement
 
01:38:43.669 --> 01:38:43.679 align:start position:0%
uses in favor of the taser is that it's
 
01:38:43.679 --> 01:38:44.870 align:start position:0%
uses in favor of the taser is that it's
not

01:38:44.870 --> 01:38:44.880 align:start position:0%
not
 
01:38:47.189 --> 01:38:47.199 align:start position:0%
a uh lethal weapon and it does not cause
 
01:38:48.950 --> 01:38:48.960 align:start position:0%
serious bodily injury
 
01:38:51.109 --> 01:38:51.119 align:start position:0%
so my concern is that we we're leaving a
 
01:38:53.430 --> 01:38:53.440 align:start position:0%
kind of a gray area in here that's going
 
01:38:56.070 --> 01:38:56.080 align:start position:0%
to be left up to the courts
 
01:38:58.390 --> 01:38:58.400 align:start position:0%
to decide where we should be deciding
 
01:38:58.400 --> 01:38:59.109 align:start position:0%
to decide where we should be deciding
so

01:38:59.109 --> 01:38:59.119 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:39:02.310 --> 01:39:02.320 align:start position:0%
would you would you agree that
 
01:39:04.390 --> 01:39:04.400 align:start position:0%
that it has been positioned in law
 
01:39:06.149 --> 01:39:06.159 align:start position:0%
enforcement that tasers or not do not
 
01:39:08.950 --> 01:39:08.960 align:start position:0%
cause serious body injury
 
01:39:12.950 --> 01:39:12.960 align:start position:0%
i will occasionally have a smoke smoke a
 
01:39:14.950 --> 01:39:14.960 align:start position:0%
cigar and have a drink with my law
 
01:39:17.550 --> 01:39:17.560 align:start position:0%
enforcement buddies and in all of those
 
01:39:20.790 --> 01:39:20.800 align:start position:0%
conversations i think it's all agreed
 
01:39:23.590 --> 01:39:23.600 align:start position:0%
that a taser is not deadly force
 
01:39:27.270 --> 01:39:27.280 align:start position:0%
the the the point of inventing the taser
 
01:39:30.950 --> 01:39:30.960 align:start position:0%
was to create non-lethal force and so
 
01:39:33.750 --> 01:39:33.760 align:start position:0%
i i wouldn't think the use of a taser
 
01:39:37.350 --> 01:39:37.360 align:start position:0%
would uh violate this law if passed this
 
01:39:45.590 --> 01:39:45.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:47.990 --> 01:39:48.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um and thank you for
 
01:39:50.790 --> 01:39:50.800 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
01:39:50.800 --> 01:39:51.910 align:start position:0%
taking my question
the

01:39:51.910 --> 01:39:51.920 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:39:54.149 --> 01:39:54.159 align:start position:0%
when you take out the affecting arrest
 
01:39:57.109 --> 01:39:57.119 align:start position:0%
part and and just leave in the escape
 
01:39:57.119 --> 01:39:58.870 align:start position:0%
part and and just leave in the escape
part

01:39:58.870 --> 01:39:58.880 align:start position:0%
part
 
01:40:01.910 --> 01:40:01.920 align:start position:0%
do you think that that erases the line
 
01:40:03.750 --> 01:40:03.760 align:start position:0%
between um
 
01:40:06.229 --> 01:40:06.239 align:start position:0%
affecting an arrest and an escape
 
01:40:08.310 --> 01:40:08.320 align:start position:0%
how does the officer tell when he's
 
01:40:08.320 --> 01:40:09.270 align:start position:0%
how does the officer tell when he's
reached

01:40:09.270 --> 01:40:09.280 align:start position:0%
reached
 
01:40:09.280 --> 01:40:10.709 align:start position:0%
reached
uh

01:40:10.709 --> 01:40:10.719 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:40:11.990 --> 01:40:12.000 align:start position:0%
that point
 
01:40:14.229 --> 01:40:14.239 align:start position:0%
um and i'll clarify with an example i
 
01:40:15.830 --> 01:40:15.840 align:start position:0%
just talked to my son-in-law who's a
 
01:40:18.149 --> 01:40:18.159 align:start position:0%
police officer and said he's trying to
 
01:40:21.270 --> 01:40:21.280 align:start position:0%
effect an arrest and he's overpowered
 
01:40:24.470 --> 01:40:24.480 align:start position:0%
at what point does this law apply if you
 
01:40:26.229 --> 01:40:26.239 align:start position:0%
take the affecting
 
01:40:28.310 --> 01:40:28.320 align:start position:0%
arrest part out of it so i have a
 
01:40:30.550 --> 01:40:30.560 align:start position:0%
problem trying to how do you find that
 
01:40:30.560 --> 01:40:31.350 align:start position:0%
problem trying to how do you find that
line

01:40:31.350 --> 01:40:31.360 align:start position:0%
line
 
01:40:33.030 --> 01:40:33.040 align:start position:0%
yes sir thank you representative newman
 
01:40:35.350 --> 01:40:35.360 align:start position:0%
i i would i would give a very similar
 
01:40:37.270 --> 01:40:37.280 align:start position:0%
answer to one i've already given where i
 
01:40:39.430 --> 01:40:39.440 align:start position:0%
think roman numeral
 
01:40:42.550 --> 01:40:42.560 align:start position:0%
ii bravo one
 
01:40:44.470 --> 01:40:44.480 align:start position:0%
essentially says if the person you're
 
01:40:47.270 --> 01:40:47.280 align:start position:0%
arresting is likely to do serious
 
01:40:50.070 --> 01:40:50.080 align:start position:0%
uh is to seriously endanger human life
 
01:40:52.870 --> 01:40:52.880 align:start position:0%
or inflict serious bodily injury
 
01:40:52.880 --> 01:40:53.830 align:start position:0%
or inflict serious bodily injury
um

01:40:53.830 --> 01:40:53.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:40:53.840 --> 01:40:55.030 align:start position:0%
um
then

01:40:55.030 --> 01:40:55.040 align:start position:0%
then
 
01:40:57.270 --> 01:40:57.280 align:start position:0%
the green light is lit and the rules of
 
01:41:00.870 --> 01:41:00.880 align:start position:0%
engagement go into effect and the use of
 
01:41:03.350 --> 01:41:03.360 align:start position:0%
of lethal force in that scenario is
 
01:41:03.360 --> 01:41:15.830 align:start position:0%
of lethal force in that scenario is
authorized

01:41:15.830 --> 01:41:15.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:19.030 --> 01:41:19.040 align:start position:0%
thank you vice chair our chairman uh uh
 
01:41:20.629 --> 01:41:20.639 align:start position:0%
mike thank you for taking my question
 
01:41:20.639 --> 01:41:22.149 align:start position:0%
mike thank you for taking my question
representative

01:41:22.149 --> 01:41:22.159 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:41:26.070 --> 01:41:26.080 align:start position:0%
i just want to understand that even if a
 
01:41:29.270 --> 01:41:29.280 align:start position:0%
fleeing person is not a risk and that is
 
01:41:31.830 --> 01:41:31.840 align:start position:0%
uh proven a fact even after the act has
 
01:41:33.270 --> 01:41:33.280 align:start position:0%
been committed
 
01:41:35.830 --> 01:41:35.840 align:start position:0%
just the officers feelings of them being
 
01:41:39.669 --> 01:41:39.679 align:start position:0%
a threat validate being shot in the back
 
01:41:39.679 --> 01:41:41.109 align:start position:0%
a threat validate being shot in the back
and

01:41:41.109 --> 01:41:41.119 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:41:43.750 --> 01:41:43.760 align:start position:0%
i i just want to know your that is that
 
01:41:46.629 --> 01:41:46.639 align:start position:0%
how i'm understanding this
 
01:41:49.990 --> 01:41:50.000 align:start position:0%
so thank you for the question uh i
 
01:41:52.870 --> 01:41:52.880 align:start position:0%
am in the
 
01:41:55.510 --> 01:41:55.520 align:start position:0%
large group of people who believe that
 
01:41:57.990 --> 01:41:58.000 align:start position:0%
we ask law enforcement to do
 
01:42:00.950 --> 01:42:00.960 align:start position:0%
an incredibly difficult job
 
01:42:03.669 --> 01:42:03.679 align:start position:0%
they when they're out on the patrol
 
01:42:05.990 --> 01:42:06.000 align:start position:0%
they're everything from
 
01:42:07.830 --> 01:42:07.840 align:start position:0%
you know somebody who would
 
01:42:09.910 --> 01:42:09.920 align:start position:0%
you know look in on a kid playing in the
 
01:42:11.510 --> 01:42:11.520 align:start position:0%
front yard
 
01:42:14.229 --> 01:42:14.239 align:start position:0%
to having to deal with these scenarios
 
01:42:16.950 --> 01:42:16.960 align:start position:0%
where deadly force may be required
 
01:42:18.629 --> 01:42:18.639 align:start position:0%
and so we
 
01:42:21.270 --> 01:42:21.280 align:start position:0%
we give them deadly force
 
01:42:23.910 --> 01:42:23.920 align:start position:0%
and the authority to use it because
 
01:42:26.310 --> 01:42:26.320 align:start position:0%
we trust in their
 
01:42:28.950 --> 01:42:28.960 align:start position:0%
the selection process we trust in the
 
01:42:28.960 --> 01:42:30.550 align:start position:0%
the selection process we trust in the
training

01:42:30.550 --> 01:42:30.560 align:start position:0%
training
 
01:42:32.950 --> 01:42:32.960 align:start position:0%
we trust in their judgment we trust in
 
01:42:36.709 --> 01:42:36.719 align:start position:0%
their humanity to to be able to uh
 
01:42:40.950 --> 01:42:40.960 align:start position:0%
exercise lethal force judiciously and
 
01:42:43.350 --> 01:42:43.360 align:start position:0%
so if um
 
01:42:46.470 --> 01:42:46.480 align:start position:0%
if a if the law enforcement officer uh
 
01:42:49.270 --> 01:42:49.280 align:start position:0%
were to testify and say that in their
 
01:42:51.030 --> 01:42:51.040 align:start position:0%
their their intent
 
01:42:53.350 --> 01:42:53.360 align:start position:0%
in using lethal force
 
01:42:55.350 --> 01:42:55.360 align:start position:0%
to stop
 
01:42:56.870 --> 01:42:56.880 align:start position:0%
a fleeing
 
01:42:59.669 --> 01:42:59.679 align:start position:0%
perpetrator was because of the belief
 
01:43:02.149 --> 01:43:02.159 align:start position:0%
that that person would was a threat to
 
01:43:02.159 --> 01:43:03.669 align:start position:0%
that that person would was a threat to
others

01:43:03.669 --> 01:43:03.679 align:start position:0%
others
 
01:43:06.310 --> 01:43:06.320 align:start position:0%
i think the tendency would be to believe
 
01:43:06.320 --> 01:43:07.669 align:start position:0%
i think the tendency would be to believe
their

01:43:07.669 --> 01:43:07.679 align:start position:0%
their
 
01:43:09.830 --> 01:43:09.840 align:start position:0%
their judgment in the in the heat of the
 
01:43:09.840 --> 01:43:11.030 align:start position:0%
their judgment in the in the heat of the
moment

01:43:11.030 --> 01:43:11.040 align:start position:0%
moment
 
01:43:13.270 --> 01:43:13.280 align:start position:0%
and um and of course there are bad
 
01:43:15.430 --> 01:43:15.440 align:start position:0%
actors but that's why we have jury
 
01:43:16.950 --> 01:43:16.960 align:start position:0%
trials so
 
01:43:21.430 --> 01:43:21.440 align:start position:0%
i i i just think that this is a way of
 
01:43:23.830 --> 01:43:23.840 align:start position:0%
protecting the integrity of the police
 
01:43:25.910 --> 01:43:25.920 align:start position:0%
force by making sure that the rules of
 
01:43:25.920 --> 01:43:27.189 align:start position:0%
force by making sure that the rules of
engagement

01:43:27.189 --> 01:43:27.199 align:start position:0%
engagement
 
01:43:29.910 --> 01:43:29.920 align:start position:0%
are done in a way in which i think
 
01:43:31.669 --> 01:43:31.679 align:start position:0%
most people would agree
 
01:43:34.470 --> 01:43:34.480 align:start position:0%
don't use lethal force just so you can
 
01:43:37.270 --> 01:43:37.280 align:start position:0%
arrest somebody however
 
01:43:39.510 --> 01:43:39.520 align:start position:0%
if you think somebody is running away
 
01:43:41.030 --> 01:43:41.040 align:start position:0%
and they're dangerous
 
01:43:44.790 --> 01:43:44.800 align:start position:0%
by all means use the force necessary to
 
01:43:48.310 --> 01:43:48.320 align:start position:0%
to secure the public safety so
 
01:43:52.229 --> 01:43:52.239 align:start position:0%
i hope that answers your question
 
01:43:56.390 --> 01:43:56.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:58.310 --> 01:43:58.320 align:start position:0%
thank you for rep uh
 
01:43:59.669 --> 01:43:59.679 align:start position:0%
thank you for asking me i do have a
 
01:43:59.679 --> 01:44:00.790 align:start position:0%
thank you for asking me i do have a
follow-up

01:44:00.790 --> 01:44:00.800 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
01:44:00.800 --> 01:44:02.470 align:start position:0%
follow-up
um

01:44:02.470 --> 01:44:02.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:44:04.550 --> 01:44:04.560 align:start position:0%
thank you representative again so you
 
01:44:06.629 --> 01:44:06.639 align:start position:0%
just gave testimony that there are bad
 
01:44:09.669 --> 01:44:09.679 align:start position:0%
actors police actors in our state don't
 
01:44:11.590 --> 01:44:11.600 align:start position:0%
you think this would embolden them to
 
01:44:15.270 --> 01:44:15.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:17.350 --> 01:44:17.360 align:start position:0%
i think quite the opposite it would be
 
01:44:19.270 --> 01:44:19.280 align:start position:0%
setting in in place
 
01:44:20.790 --> 01:44:20.800 align:start position:0%
uh a clear
 
01:44:23.910 --> 01:44:23.920 align:start position:0%
rule of engagement that that removes the
 
01:44:26.310 --> 01:44:26.320 align:start position:0%
authority to use deadly force
 
01:44:29.270 --> 01:44:29.280 align:start position:0%
uh in a particular scenario
 
01:44:31.350 --> 01:44:31.360 align:start position:0%
that is devoid
 
01:44:34.390 --> 01:44:34.400 align:start position:0%
of a threat by the perpetrator
 
01:44:34.400 --> 01:44:35.189 align:start position:0%
of a threat by the perpetrator
so

01:44:35.189 --> 01:44:35.199 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:44:38.149 --> 01:44:38.159 align:start position:0%
so there are bad actors in every segment
 
01:44:41.109 --> 01:44:41.119 align:start position:0%
of society to include the legislature so
 
01:44:43.430 --> 01:44:43.440 align:start position:0%
i don't i don't think we govern
 
01:44:46.310 --> 01:44:46.320 align:start position:0%
for the you know just the bad actors we
 
01:44:48.629 --> 01:44:48.639 align:start position:0%
govern for
 
01:44:50.870 --> 01:44:50.880 align:start position:0%
the preponderance of societal
 
01:44:50.880 --> 01:44:59.109 align:start position:0%
the preponderance of societal
interaction

01:44:59.109 --> 01:44:59.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:00.629 --> 01:45:00.639 align:start position:0%
no thank you so much and thanks for
 
01:45:04.550 --> 01:45:04.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:06.229 --> 01:45:06.239 align:start position:0%

it
 
01:45:17.350 --> 01:45:17.360 align:start position:0%
reduces the number the amount of reasons
 
01:45:19.990 --> 01:45:20.000 align:start position:0%
that an officer can use deadly force is
 
01:45:22.390 --> 01:45:22.400 align:start position:0%

i thought that i was a co-sponsor on
 
01:46:13.189 --> 01:46:13.199 align:start position:0%
this bill but i think i was a co-sponsor
 
01:46:15.030 --> 01:46:15.040 align:start position:0%
on last year's version of this i wasn't
 
01:46:16.709 --> 01:46:16.719 align:start position:0%
able to come into the committee and
 
01:46:18.790 --> 01:46:18.800 align:start position:0%
testify last year
 
01:46:21.350 --> 01:46:21.360 align:start position:0%
um by the way i support the bill
 
01:46:23.590 --> 01:46:23.600 align:start position:0%
not because i agree with its intent but
 
01:46:25.030 --> 01:46:25.040 align:start position:0%
because the
 
01:46:27.350 --> 01:46:27.360 align:start position:0%
u.s supreme court took up this issue in
 
01:46:27.360 --> 01:46:29.350 align:start position:0%
u.s supreme court took up this issue in
1984

01:46:29.350 --> 01:46:29.360 align:start position:0%
1984
 
01:46:31.910 --> 01:46:31.920 align:start position:0%
and ruled in 1985
 
01:46:34.390 --> 01:46:34.400 align:start position:0%
that police were not allowed to use
 
01:46:36.709 --> 01:46:36.719 align:start position:0%
deadly force
 
01:46:39.990 --> 01:46:40.000 align:start position:0%
simply to stop a fleeing felon

01:46:50.870 --> 01:46:50.880 align:start position:0%
and i also included
 
01:46:50.880 --> 01:46:51.830 align:start position:0%
and i also included
the

01:46:51.830 --> 01:46:51.840 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:46:53.590 --> 01:46:53.600 align:start position:0%
dissenting arguments by justices
 
01:46:56.390 --> 01:46:56.400 align:start position:0%
rehnquist and o'connor um as i said i i
 
01:46:58.870 --> 01:46:58.880 align:start position:0%
prefer the the logic and reasoning that
 
01:47:00.870 --> 01:47:00.880 align:start position:0%
that was used in the minority report but
 
01:47:02.950 --> 01:47:02.960 align:start position:0%
i'm just dealing with what the
 
01:47:05.030 --> 01:47:05.040 align:start position:0%
the u.s supreme court tells us
 
01:47:05.040 --> 01:47:06.629 align:start position:0%
the u.s supreme court tells us
um

01:47:06.629 --> 01:47:06.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:47:09.189 --> 01:47:09.199 align:start position:0%
i also just sent an email to members of
 
01:47:10.550 --> 01:47:10.560 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
01:47:10.560 --> 01:47:12.149 align:start position:0%
the committee
um

01:47:12.149 --> 01:47:12.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:47:14.229 --> 01:47:14.239 align:start position:0%
noting that in their notes the us
 
01:47:17.910 --> 01:47:17.920 align:start position:0%
supreme court actually cites rsa 620
 
01:47:20.310 --> 01:47:20.320 align:start position:0%
7 section 5 part 2 and this part in
 
01:47:22.470 --> 01:47:22.480 align:start position:0%
particular as
 
01:47:25.590 --> 01:47:25.600 align:start position:0%
a provision that is unconstitutional the
 
01:47:28.870 --> 01:47:28.880 align:start position:0%
minority used our statute and the
 
01:47:31.830 --> 01:47:31.840 align:start position:0%
statutes i think 24 other states as
 
01:47:33.590 --> 01:47:33.600 align:start position:0%
justification for
 
01:47:36.070 --> 01:47:36.080 align:start position:0%
half the state legislatures have agreed
 
01:47:38.870 --> 01:47:38.880 align:start position:0%
as new hampshire did at the time
 
01:47:40.709 --> 01:47:40.719 align:start position:0%
that if you have a fleeing felon that
 
01:47:42.390 --> 01:47:42.400 align:start position:0%
the officer
 
01:47:45.430 --> 01:47:45.440 align:start position:0%
needs to have some legal ability to use
 
01:47:48.629 --> 01:47:48.639 align:start position:0%
deadly force to stop a fleeing felon
 
01:47:52.709 --> 01:47:52.719 align:start position:0%
however the the police unions and the um
 
01:47:52.719 --> 01:47:53.510 align:start position:0%
however the the police unions and the um
the

01:47:53.510 --> 01:47:53.520 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:47:55.430 --> 01:47:55.440 align:start position:0%
defending party in tennessee versus
 
01:47:55.440 --> 01:47:56.550 align:start position:0%
defending party in tennessee versus
gardner

01:47:56.550 --> 01:47:56.560 align:start position:0%
gardner
 
01:47:58.149 --> 01:47:58.159 align:start position:0%
uh was
 
01:47:58.159 --> 01:48:00.149 align:start position:0%
uh was
um

01:48:00.149 --> 01:48:00.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:48:01.830 --> 01:48:01.840 align:start position:0%
they were given the opportunity to bring
 
01:48:04.390 --> 01:48:04.400 align:start position:0%
in studies showing that a fleeing felon
 
01:48:05.910 --> 01:48:05.920 align:start position:0%
was so likely to go on and commit
 
01:48:07.430 --> 01:48:07.440 align:start position:0%
another crime
 
01:48:07.440 --> 01:48:09.160 align:start position:0%
another crime
that

01:48:09.160 --> 01:48:09.170 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:48:09.170 --> 01:48:10.310 align:start position:0%
that
[Music]

01:48:10.310 --> 01:48:10.320 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:48:12.310 --> 01:48:12.320 align:start position:0%
that an officer would be allowed to use
 
01:48:13.750 --> 01:48:13.760 align:start position:0%
deadly force because of the likelihood
 
01:48:15.270 --> 01:48:15.280 align:start position:0%
of them going out and committing another
 
01:48:15.280 --> 01:48:17.350 align:start position:0%
of them going out and committing another
crime

01:48:17.350 --> 01:48:17.360 align:start position:0%
crime
 
01:48:19.030 --> 01:48:19.040 align:start position:0%
not to get into the details but this
 
01:48:21.830 --> 01:48:21.840 align:start position:0%
dates back to common law when a felony
 
01:48:23.910 --> 01:48:23.920 align:start position:0%
uh in early times is almost always a
 
01:48:26.070 --> 01:48:26.080 align:start position:0%
life sentence or capital offense it was
 
01:48:28.229 --> 01:48:28.239 align:start position:0%
almost always kidnapping rape murder
 
01:48:30.870 --> 01:48:30.880 align:start position:0%
some really horrible crime
 
01:48:34.070 --> 01:48:34.080 align:start position:0%
now that almost everything is a felony
 
01:48:34.080 --> 01:48:35.030 align:start position:0%
now that almost everything is a felony
the

01:48:35.030 --> 01:48:35.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:48:36.470 --> 01:48:36.480 align:start position:0%
courts are now looking at a felony
 
01:48:37.830 --> 01:48:37.840 align:start position:0%
differently other countries are looking
 
01:48:39.430 --> 01:48:39.440 align:start position:0%
at a felony differently an american
 
01:48:41.189 --> 01:48:41.199 align:start position:0%
felony is just doesn't hold the weight
 
01:48:42.790 --> 01:48:42.800 align:start position:0%
that it used to
 
01:48:42.800 --> 01:48:43.750 align:start position:0%
that it used to
so

01:48:43.750 --> 01:48:43.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:48:45.189 --> 01:48:45.199 align:start position:0%
what we
 
01:48:47.270 --> 01:48:47.280 align:start position:0%
you know a misdemeanor back in in
 
01:48:49.590 --> 01:48:49.600 align:start position:0%
colonial times in early america would be
 
01:48:51.590 --> 01:48:51.600 align:start position:0%
you know potentially 10 years of
 
01:48:53.189 --> 01:48:53.199 align:start position:0%
prison or possibly 10 years of hard
 
01:48:53.199 --> 01:48:54.149 align:start position:0%
prison or possibly 10 years of hard
labor

01:48:54.149 --> 01:48:54.159 align:start position:0%
labor
 
01:48:56.629 --> 01:48:56.639 align:start position:0%
so misdemeanor had a much greater reach
 
01:48:57.830 --> 01:48:57.840 align:start position:0%
at that time
 
01:48:57.840 --> 01:48:59.510 align:start position:0%
at that time
um

01:48:59.510 --> 01:48:59.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:48:59.520 --> 01:49:00.629 align:start position:0%
um
so

01:49:00.629 --> 01:49:00.639 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:49:04.629 --> 01:49:04.639 align:start position:0%
the the the bill needs to pass um
 
01:49:06.550 --> 01:49:06.560 align:start position:0%
in in one form or another i have
 
01:49:07.990 --> 01:49:08.000 align:start position:0%
introduced an amendment that simply
 
01:49:10.790 --> 01:49:10.800 align:start position:0%
changes the word and to or
 
01:49:13.590 --> 01:49:13.600 align:start position:0%
so that if you had a police officer
 
01:49:15.430 --> 01:49:15.440 align:start position:0%
interacting with
 
01:49:15.440 --> 01:49:16.790 align:start position:0%
interacting with
um

01:49:16.790 --> 01:49:16.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:49:20.629 --> 01:49:20.639 align:start position:0%
with someone right now the statute says
 
01:49:23.430 --> 01:49:23.440 align:start position:0%
um oops i've lost the statute
 
01:49:25.030 --> 01:49:25.040 align:start position:0%
there it is
 
01:49:29.990 --> 01:49:30.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:32.310 --> 01:49:32.320 align:start position:0%
that the
 
01:49:32.320 --> 01:49:35.109 align:start position:0%
that the
officer

01:49:35.109 --> 01:49:35.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:37.109 --> 01:49:37.119 align:start position:0%
the officer has made a reasonable effort
 
01:49:38.950 --> 01:49:38.960 align:start position:0%
to advise the person that he is a law
 
01:49:41.270 --> 01:49:41.280 align:start position:0%
enforcement officer attempting to affect
 
01:49:43.830 --> 01:49:43.840 align:start position:0%
an arrest and has reasonable grounds to
 
01:49:45.189 --> 01:49:45.199 align:start position:0%
believe that the person is aware of the
 
01:49:45.199 --> 01:49:46.390 align:start position:0%
believe that the person is aware of the
facts

01:49:46.390 --> 01:49:46.400 align:start position:0%
facts
 
01:49:47.990 --> 01:49:48.000 align:start position:0%
when this same issue came up several
 
01:49:49.350 --> 01:49:49.360 align:start position:0%
years ago i believe one member of the
 
01:49:52.390 --> 01:49:52.400 align:start position:0%
committee or or maybe two or three
 
01:49:54.229 --> 01:49:54.239 align:start position:0%
were concerned that an officer would
 
01:49:57.270 --> 01:49:57.280 align:start position:0%
show up to make an arrest wearing their
 
01:49:59.830 --> 01:49:59.840 align:start position:0%
uniform having their badge obviously
 
01:50:01.910 --> 01:50:01.920 align:start position:0%
being an officer that they shouldn't
 
01:50:04.310 --> 01:50:04.320 align:start position:0%
have to then
 
01:50:05.830 --> 01:50:05.840 align:start position:0%
in the heat of the moment they shouldn't
 
01:50:07.669 --> 01:50:07.679 align:start position:0%
have to also
 
01:50:10.390 --> 01:50:10.400 align:start position:0%
tell the person that they're a cop uh
 
01:50:11.669 --> 01:50:11.679 align:start position:0%
once it's obvious that they're in
 
01:50:13.510 --> 01:50:13.520 align:start position:0%
uniform and that they're very
 
01:50:17.109 --> 01:50:17.119 align:start position:0%
conspicuously serving as an officer
 
01:50:18.550 --> 01:50:18.560 align:start position:0%
so that that's the reason for the
 
01:50:18.560 --> 01:50:19.669 align:start position:0%
so that that's the reason for the
amendment

01:50:19.669 --> 01:50:19.679 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
01:50:21.669 --> 01:50:21.679 align:start position:0%
the amendment would help police just a
 
01:50:25.669 --> 01:50:25.679 align:start position:0%
little bit in a life and death emergency
 
01:50:27.030 --> 01:50:27.040 align:start position:0%
but i
 
01:50:29.669 --> 01:50:29.679 align:start position:0%
wanted to
 
01:50:29.679 --> 01:50:30.629 align:start position:0%
wanted to
um

01:50:30.629 --> 01:50:30.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:50:32.790 --> 01:50:32.800 align:start position:0%
quickly read off what
 
01:50:36.229 --> 01:50:36.239 align:start position:0%
the the u.s supreme court said
 
01:50:38.310 --> 01:50:38.320 align:start position:0%
they said in 1985 the use of deadly
 
01:50:40.229 --> 01:50:40.239 align:start position:0%
force to prevent the escape of all
 
01:50:41.750 --> 01:50:41.760 align:start position:0%
felony suspects whatever the
 
01:50:44.229 --> 01:50:44.239 align:start position:0%
circumstances is constitutionally
 
01:50:44.239 --> 01:50:45.510 align:start position:0%
circumstances is constitutionally
unreasonable

01:50:45.510 --> 01:50:45.520 align:start position:0%
unreasonable
 
01:50:47.189 --> 01:50:47.199 align:start position:0%
it is not better that all felony
 
01:50:50.550 --> 01:50:50.560 align:start position:0%
suspects die that than that they escape
 
01:50:52.390 --> 01:50:52.400 align:start position:0%
where the suspect poses no immediate
 
01:50:54.470 --> 01:50:54.480 align:start position:0%
threat to the officer and no threat to
 
01:50:56.629 --> 01:50:56.639 align:start position:0%
others the harm resulting from failing
 
01:50:58.709 --> 01:50:58.719 align:start position:0%
to apprehend him does not justify the
 
01:51:01.270 --> 01:51:01.280 align:start position:0%
use of deadly force to do so it is no
 
01:51:03.109 --> 01:51:03.119 align:start position:0%
doubt unfortunate when a suspect who is
 
01:51:05.270 --> 01:51:05.280 align:start position:0%
in sight escapes but the fact that the
 
01:51:07.590 --> 01:51:07.600 align:start position:0%
police arrive a little late or a little
 
01:51:10.070 --> 01:51:10.080 align:start position:0%
slower afoot does not always justify
 
01:51:12.229 --> 01:51:12.239 align:start position:0%
killing the suspect a police officer may
 
01:51:13.990 --> 01:51:14.000 align:start position:0%
not seize an unarmed non-dangerous
 
01:51:15.910 --> 01:51:15.920 align:start position:0%
suspect by shooting him dead the
 
01:51:17.830 --> 01:51:17.840 align:start position:0%
tennessee statute is unconstitutional
 
01:51:19.590 --> 01:51:19.600 align:start position:0%
insofar as it authorizes the use of
 
01:51:21.510 --> 01:51:21.520 align:start position:0%
deadly force against such fleeing
 
01:51:23.910 --> 01:51:23.920 align:start position:0%
suspects and again they they cited our
 
01:51:26.470 --> 01:51:26.480 align:start position:0%
statute new hampshire statute also
 
01:51:26.480 --> 01:51:28.310 align:start position:0%
statute new hampshire statute also
um

01:51:28.310 --> 01:51:28.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:51:29.910 --> 01:51:29.920 align:start position:0%
in this case so i don't i don't think
 
01:51:31.430 --> 01:51:31.440 align:start position:0%
there's any question that that the
 
01:51:33.270 --> 01:51:33.280 align:start position:0%
wording that we have in the in the rsa
 
01:51:35.990 --> 01:51:36.000 align:start position:0%
right now is unconstitutional
 
01:51:38.950 --> 01:51:38.960 align:start position:0%
the problem of leaving that in place
 
01:51:40.870 --> 01:51:40.880 align:start position:0%
is that a lot of police departments then
 
01:51:42.790 --> 01:51:42.800 align:start position:0%
go back and refer to our statutes and
 
01:51:45.189 --> 01:51:45.199 align:start position:0%
assume that all of our rsas must be
 
01:51:47.430 --> 01:51:47.440 align:start position:0%
constitutional that they must
 
01:51:49.189 --> 01:51:49.199 align:start position:0%
stand up and you have
 
01:51:50.950 --> 01:51:50.960 align:start position:0%
department policies that are being
 
01:51:52.950 --> 01:51:52.960 align:start position:0%
written and insurance policies and
 
01:51:54.870 --> 01:51:54.880 align:start position:0%
contracts that are written around our
 
01:51:56.550 --> 01:51:56.560 align:start position:0%
our rsas
 
01:51:56.560 --> 01:51:57.430 align:start position:0%
our rsas
so

01:51:57.430 --> 01:51:57.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:52:00.790 --> 01:52:00.800 align:start position:0%
it's it's it's a justification
 
01:52:00.800 --> 01:52:02.310 align:start position:0%
it's it's it's a justification
um

01:52:02.310 --> 01:52:02.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:52:04.950 --> 01:52:04.960 align:start position:0%
if the committee absolutely wants to
 
01:52:07.030 --> 01:52:07.040 align:start position:0%
ensure it there's
 
01:52:09.270 --> 01:52:09.280 align:start position:0%
there is a way around it
 
01:52:11.189 --> 01:52:11.199 align:start position:0%
we authorize
 
01:52:12.790 --> 01:52:12.800 align:start position:0%
qualified immunity and other certain
 
01:52:14.790 --> 01:52:14.800 align:start position:0%
powers to the badge you can also assign
 
01:52:17.109 --> 01:52:17.119 align:start position:0%
it to the person but if you're going to
 
01:52:19.430 --> 01:52:19.440 align:start position:0%
assign the ability to shoot a fleeing
 
01:52:19.440 --> 01:52:20.629 align:start position:0%
assign the ability to shoot a fleeing
felon

01:52:20.629 --> 01:52:20.639 align:start position:0%
felon
 
01:52:22.229 --> 01:52:22.239 align:start position:0%
i believe that you'd have to assign it
 
01:52:22.239 --> 01:52:22.950 align:start position:0%
i believe that you'd have to assign it
to

01:52:22.950 --> 01:52:22.960 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:52:24.709 --> 01:52:24.719 align:start position:0%
absolutely everyone
 
01:52:27.430 --> 01:52:27.440 align:start position:0%
meaning that any joe shmoe on the street
 
01:52:29.510 --> 01:52:29.520 align:start position:0%
if they're affecting a citizen's arrest
 
01:52:31.830 --> 01:52:31.840 align:start position:0%
if they witness a felony that they would
 
01:52:34.550 --> 01:52:34.560 align:start position:0%
have the authority to
 
01:52:35.830 --> 01:52:35.840 align:start position:0%
shoot someone in the back as they're
 
01:52:37.990 --> 01:52:38.000 align:start position:0%
running away and i'm i'm not
 
01:52:39.910 --> 01:52:39.920 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure about all the
 
01:52:41.750 --> 01:52:41.760 align:start position:0%
pros and cons or how the members of the
 
01:52:43.669 --> 01:52:43.679 align:start position:0%
committee would see that
 
01:52:47.430 --> 01:52:47.440 align:start position:0%
so the the amendment number is 225 h
 
01:52:49.270 --> 01:52:49.280 align:start position:0%
and it's just one word it changes the
 
01:52:51.830 --> 01:52:51.840 align:start position:0%
word and to or
 
01:52:58.229 --> 01:52:58.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:58.239 --> 01:53:02.870 align:start position:0%
 
boardney

01:53:02.870 --> 01:53:02.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:04.390 --> 01:53:04.400 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:53:07.350 --> 01:53:07.360 align:start position:0%
thank you mr representative
 
01:53:07.360 --> 01:53:08.470 align:start position:0%
thank you mr representative
um

01:53:08.470 --> 01:53:08.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:53:09.990 --> 01:53:10.000 align:start position:0%
and i know we're really talking about
 
01:53:12.229 --> 01:53:12.239 align:start position:0%
the bill but uh introduction of this
 
01:53:15.990 --> 01:53:16.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:18.070 --> 01:53:18.080 align:start position:0%
lessen the effect of the bill by
 
01:53:18.080 --> 01:53:19.430 align:start position:0%
lessen the effect of the bill by
changing

01:53:19.430 --> 01:53:19.440 align:start position:0%
changing
 
01:53:21.510 --> 01:53:21.520 align:start position:0%
and or
 
01:53:23.189 --> 01:53:23.199 align:start position:0%
the officer doesn't have to
 
01:53:25.270 --> 01:53:25.280 align:start position:0%
consider that the
 
01:53:27.669 --> 01:53:27.679 align:start position:0%
flinging felon is going to be using
 
01:53:31.030 --> 01:53:31.040 align:start position:0%
deadly force uh using and requires both
 
01:53:33.189 --> 01:53:33.199 align:start position:0%
of those conditions to happen
 
01:53:36.310 --> 01:53:36.320 align:start position:0%
have to take place don't you agree
 
01:53:36.320 --> 01:53:38.629 align:start position:0%
have to take place don't you agree
um

01:53:38.629 --> 01:53:38.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:53:40.950 --> 01:53:40.960 align:start position:0%
well if we're going to enact the bill as
 
01:53:43.030 --> 01:53:43.040 align:start position:0%
amended the bill takes away the ability
 
01:53:45.109 --> 01:53:45.119 align:start position:0%
of the officer to shoot a fleeing
 
01:53:46.870 --> 01:53:46.880 align:start position:0%
suspect however the new hampshire
 
01:53:50.310 --> 01:53:50.320 align:start position:0%
supreme court does allow us to
 
01:53:52.470 --> 01:53:52.480 align:start position:0%
authorize a police officer
 
01:53:55.189 --> 01:53:55.199 align:start position:0%
to shoot a felon if they are using a
 
01:53:56.950 --> 01:53:56.960 align:start position:0%
deadly weapon and attempting to escape
 
01:54:00.310 --> 01:54:00.320 align:start position:0%
or otherwise indicates that he is likely
 
01:54:02.950 --> 01:54:02.960 align:start position:0%
to seriously endanger human life or
 
01:54:04.790 --> 01:54:04.800 align:start position:0%
inflict serious bodily injury unless
 
01:54:07.189 --> 01:54:07.199 align:start position:0%
apprehended without delay that's from
 
01:54:09.350 --> 01:54:09.360 align:start position:0%
the statute so that part of the statute
 
01:54:11.350 --> 01:54:11.360 align:start position:0%
would remain in place
 
01:54:13.990 --> 01:54:14.000 align:start position:0%
um my thought is we're leaving that part
 
01:54:15.669 --> 01:54:15.679 align:start position:0%
of the statute in place
 
01:54:15.679 --> 01:54:16.870 align:start position:0%
of the statute in place
um

01:54:16.870 --> 01:54:16.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:54:18.390 --> 01:54:18.400 align:start position:0%
here's kind of something we can do to
 
01:54:20.790 --> 01:54:20.800 align:start position:0%
recognize that police officers if if
 
01:54:22.470 --> 01:54:22.480 align:start position:0%
that happens if somebody's using a knife
 
01:54:24.790 --> 01:54:24.800 align:start position:0%
for a weapon to to try to escape the
 
01:54:24.800 --> 01:54:26.709 align:start position:0%
for a weapon to to try to escape the
officer

01:54:26.709 --> 01:54:26.719 align:start position:0%
officer
 
01:54:28.330 --> 01:54:28.340 align:start position:0%
that that officer needs to
 
01:54:28.340 --> 01:54:29.669 align:start position:0%
that that officer needs to
[Music]

01:54:29.669 --> 01:54:29.679 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:54:31.270 --> 01:54:31.280 align:start position:0%
if they're there in uniform and it's
 
01:54:33.750 --> 01:54:33.760 align:start position:0%
obvious that they're a police officer
 
01:54:35.510 --> 01:54:35.520 align:start position:0%
i don't believe that they should
 
01:54:37.030 --> 01:54:37.040 align:start position:0%
have to say
 
01:54:39.830 --> 01:54:39.840 align:start position:0%
hey i'm a police officer before firing
 
01:54:41.589 --> 01:54:41.599 align:start position:0%
when seconds count
 
01:54:41.599 --> 01:54:42.790 align:start position:0%
when seconds count
um

01:54:42.790 --> 01:54:42.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:54:46.070 --> 01:54:46.080 align:start position:0%
you in in real self-defense cases uh
 
01:54:47.830 --> 01:54:47.840 align:start position:0%
that go to court
 
01:54:49.750 --> 01:54:49.760 align:start position:0%
you can have you're if you're lucky you
 
01:54:51.350 --> 01:54:51.360 align:start position:0%
have five or ten different witnesses but
 
01:54:53.109 --> 01:54:53.119 align:start position:0%
10 different witnesses can tell 15
 
01:54:54.470 --> 01:54:54.480 align:start position:0%
different stories
 
01:54:54.480 --> 01:54:55.350 align:start position:0%
different stories
and

01:54:55.350 --> 01:54:55.360 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:54:58.229 --> 01:54:58.239 align:start position:0%
it's very likely that a material witness
 
01:55:00.390 --> 01:55:00.400 align:start position:0%
or material witnesses
 
01:55:00.400 --> 01:55:01.430 align:start position:0%
or material witnesses
are

01:55:01.430 --> 01:55:01.440 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:55:03.430 --> 01:55:03.440 align:start position:0%
going to relay what was said
 
01:55:03.440 --> 01:55:05.669 align:start position:0%
going to relay what was said
inaccurately

01:55:05.669 --> 01:55:05.679 align:start position:0%
inaccurately
 
01:55:08.390 --> 01:55:08.400 align:start position:0%
has happened in my self-defense case
 
01:55:09.669 --> 01:55:09.679 align:start position:0%
like i say
 
01:55:11.510 --> 01:55:11.520 align:start position:0%
10 different witnesses with 15 different
 
01:55:13.750 --> 01:55:13.760 align:start position:0%
stories about what was said
 
01:55:16.149 --> 01:55:16.159 align:start position:0%
and the words that are spoken at the
 
01:55:16.159 --> 01:55:18.629 align:start position:0%
and the words that are spoken at the
time

01:55:18.629 --> 01:55:18.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:20.390 --> 01:55:20.400 align:start position:0%
people don't remember those very well
 
01:55:23.109 --> 01:55:23.119 align:start position:0%
when the fight or flight response
 
01:55:25.350 --> 01:55:25.360 align:start position:0%
kicks in and the adrenaline is is up and
 
01:55:26.390 --> 01:55:26.400 align:start position:0%
people are wondering if they're going to
 
01:55:30.229 --> 01:55:30.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:32.229 --> 01:55:32.239 align:start position:0%
and honestly an officer might might
 
01:55:35.990 --> 01:55:36.000 align:start position:0%
forget to uh to say something
 
01:55:37.510 --> 01:55:37.520 align:start position:0%
or you may have a different officer on
 
01:55:40.070 --> 01:55:40.080 align:start position:0%
the scene say hey i'm a police officer
 
01:55:41.030 --> 01:55:41.040 align:start position:0%
even though they're both wearing
 
01:55:41.040 --> 01:55:53.270 align:start position:0%
even though they're both wearing
uniforms

01:55:53.270 --> 01:55:53.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:53.280 --> 01:55:58.070 align:start position:0%
 
representative

01:55:58.070 --> 01:55:58.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:59.910 --> 01:55:59.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question and and
 
01:56:01.910 --> 01:56:01.920 align:start position:0%
pardon me but i'm i'm trying to
 
01:56:03.830 --> 01:56:03.840 align:start position:0%
understand uh
 
01:56:05.750 --> 01:56:05.760 align:start position:0%
the full implications of what it is that
 
01:56:05.760 --> 01:56:06.709 align:start position:0%
the full implications of what it is that
you're

01:56:06.709 --> 01:56:06.719 align:start position:0%
you're
 
01:56:07.910 --> 01:56:07.920 align:start position:0%
uh that you're
 
01:56:09.910 --> 01:56:09.920 align:start position:0%
that you're saying so
 
01:56:09.920 --> 01:56:11.109 align:start position:0%
that you're saying so
um

01:56:11.109 --> 01:56:11.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:56:13.589 --> 01:56:13.599 align:start position:0%
as i as i read
 
01:56:16.149 --> 01:56:16.159 align:start position:0%
the bill and the proposed changes to the
 
01:56:16.159 --> 01:56:17.510 align:start position:0%
the bill and the proposed changes to the
rsa

01:56:17.510 --> 01:56:17.520 align:start position:0%
rsa
 
01:56:17.520 --> 01:56:19.830 align:start position:0%
rsa
um

01:56:19.830 --> 01:56:19.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:56:22.070 --> 01:56:22.080 align:start position:0%
the constitutional issue isn't jumping
 
01:56:23.350 --> 01:56:23.360 align:start position:0%
out at me
 
01:56:23.360 --> 01:56:25.750 align:start position:0%
out at me
um

01:56:25.750 --> 01:56:25.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:27.109 --> 01:56:27.119 align:start position:0%
and so um
 
01:56:28.550 --> 01:56:28.560 align:start position:0%
what i'm trying to do is i'm sort of
 
01:56:30.709 --> 01:56:30.719 align:start position:0%
trying to mentally link what i'm seeing
 
01:56:33.669 --> 01:56:33.679 align:start position:0%
in the bill itself uh to the last five
 
01:56:36.149 --> 01:56:36.159 align:start position:0%
minutes of testimony regarding
 
01:56:37.750 --> 01:56:37.760 align:start position:0%
what uh
 
01:56:39.430 --> 01:56:39.440 align:start position:0%
you know what the constitutional issue
 
01:56:44.149 --> 01:56:44.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:45.270 --> 01:56:45.280 align:start position:0%
so i guess
 
01:56:46.870 --> 01:56:46.880 align:start position:0%
representative abrams ever said if you
 
01:56:49.350 --> 01:56:49.360 align:start position:0%
could speak just precisely to that issue
 
01:56:52.149 --> 01:56:52.159 align:start position:0%
what in the bill uh addresses the
 
01:56:54.390 --> 01:56:54.400 align:start position:0%
constitutional issue that you've raised
 
01:56:57.270 --> 01:56:57.280 align:start position:0%
that would be fantastic
 
01:56:59.030 --> 01:56:59.040 align:start position:0%
um i'll give you the scenario that
 
01:57:00.950 --> 01:57:00.960 align:start position:0%
tennessee versus garner
 
01:57:03.510 --> 01:57:03.520 align:start position:0%
was there was a lockdown and a curfew in
 
01:57:07.030 --> 01:57:07.040 align:start position:0%
memphis tennessee i believe it was 1973
 
01:57:10.070 --> 01:57:10.080 align:start position:0%
and officer i believe his name was elton
 
01:57:10.080 --> 01:57:11.430 align:start position:0%
and officer i believe his name was elton
hyman

01:57:11.430 --> 01:57:11.440 align:start position:0%
hyman
 
01:57:13.510 --> 01:57:13.520 align:start position:0%
was uh patrolling the streets and there
 
01:57:16.709 --> 01:57:16.719 align:start position:0%
was a a felon a 15 year old felon who
 
01:57:18.790 --> 01:57:18.800 align:start position:0%
was running away and he jumped a fence
 
01:57:20.950 --> 01:57:20.960 align:start position:0%
and officer hyman
 
01:57:22.790 --> 01:57:22.800 align:start position:0%
shot him with a hollow point bullet he
 
01:57:24.550 --> 01:57:24.560 align:start position:0%
hit him in the back of the head and the
 
01:57:27.830 --> 01:57:27.840 align:start position:0%
young man died at the hospital later
 
01:57:27.840 --> 01:57:28.629 align:start position:0%
young man died at the hospital later
so

01:57:28.629 --> 01:57:28.639 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:57:30.550 --> 01:57:30.560 align:start position:0%
the u.s supreme court had to consider
 
01:57:32.629 --> 01:57:32.639 align:start position:0%
whether or not states could authorize
 
01:57:35.109 --> 01:57:35.119 align:start position:0%
police to shoot someone
 
01:57:37.030 --> 01:57:37.040 align:start position:0%
just for running away
 
01:57:39.270 --> 01:57:39.280 align:start position:0%
and and the u.s supreme court in the six
 
01:57:41.910 --> 01:57:41.920 align:start position:0%
to three decisions that no you cannot
 
01:57:43.830 --> 01:57:43.840 align:start position:0%
we as a state legislature cannot
 
01:57:43.840 --> 01:57:45.270 align:start position:0%
we as a state legislature cannot
authorize

01:57:45.270 --> 01:57:45.280 align:start position:0%
authorize
 
01:57:47.750 --> 01:57:47.760 align:start position:0%
uh the 25 states that did we cannot
 
01:57:50.390 --> 01:57:50.400 align:start position:0%
authorize a police officer
 
01:57:52.709 --> 01:57:52.719 align:start position:0%
just based on its badge to shoot a felon
 
01:57:54.390 --> 01:57:54.400 align:start position:0%
as they're running away
 
01:57:54.400 --> 01:57:55.510 align:start position:0%
as they're running away
um

01:57:55.510 --> 01:57:55.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:57:55.520 --> 01:57:56.229 align:start position:0%
um
and

01:57:56.229 --> 01:57:56.239 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:57:58.149 --> 01:57:58.159 align:start position:0%
again the police unions were given the
 
01:57:59.910 --> 01:57:59.920 align:start position:0%
opportunity to bring in studies showing
 
01:58:02.550 --> 01:58:02.560 align:start position:0%
that felons were very likely to commit
 
01:58:04.310 --> 01:58:04.320 align:start position:0%
another crime later and they were not
 
01:58:14.310 --> 01:58:14.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:14.320 --> 01:58:17.109 align:start position:0%
 
follow-up

01:58:17.109 --> 01:58:17.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:17.119 --> 01:58:18.470 align:start position:0%
 
representative

01:58:18.470 --> 01:58:18.480 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:58:22.870 --> 01:58:22.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:22.880 --> 01:58:25.750 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:58:25.750 --> 01:58:25.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:28.390 --> 01:58:28.400 align:start position:0%
so as i as i look at the bill um what i
 
01:58:31.189 --> 01:58:31.199 align:start position:0%
see striked out are sections that
 
01:58:31.199 --> 01:58:32.310 align:start position:0%
see striked out are sections that
pertain

01:58:32.310 --> 01:58:32.320 align:start position:0%
pertain
 
01:58:34.790 --> 01:58:34.800 align:start position:0%
to affecting an arrest um
 
01:58:38.629 --> 01:58:38.639 align:start position:0%
what i'm what i'm not seeing are
 
01:58:40.390 --> 01:58:40.400 align:start position:0%
pertinent sections that appear to be
 
01:58:42.870 --> 01:58:42.880 align:start position:0%
crossed out that would address
 
01:58:44.390 --> 01:58:44.400 align:start position:0%
some of the issues you're raising around
 
01:58:46.070 --> 01:58:46.080 align:start position:0%
a fleeing person
 
01:58:46.080 --> 01:58:47.350 align:start position:0%
a fleeing person
um

01:58:47.350 --> 01:58:47.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:58:49.830 --> 01:58:49.840 align:start position:0%
and i understand i may not be seeing the
 
01:58:51.189 --> 01:58:51.199 align:start position:0%
full picture
 
01:58:52.470 --> 01:58:52.480 align:start position:0%
but i'm
 
01:58:52.480 --> 01:58:53.430 align:start position:0%
but i'm
i'm

01:58:53.430 --> 01:58:53.440 align:start position:0%
i'm
 
01:58:56.950 --> 01:58:56.960 align:start position:0%
i'm a little bit at a loss as to sort of
 
01:58:59.350 --> 01:58:59.360 align:start position:0%
where this
 
01:59:01.910 --> 01:59:01.920 align:start position:0%
where the argument is going um
 
01:59:03.430 --> 01:59:03.440 align:start position:0%
for this so
 
01:59:05.350 --> 01:59:05.360 align:start position:0%
the the bill does appear to remove
 
01:59:07.270 --> 01:59:07.280 align:start position:0%
sections that talk about using deadly
 
01:59:09.750 --> 01:59:09.760 align:start position:0%
force and the affecting of an arrest but
 
01:59:12.390 --> 01:59:12.400 align:start position:0%
it appears to allow
 
01:59:13.990 --> 01:59:14.000 align:start position:0%
pretty much
 
01:59:17.189 --> 01:59:17.199 align:start position:0%
in in place you know all of the language
 
01:59:19.030 --> 01:59:19.040 align:start position:0%
around um
 
01:59:21.350 --> 01:59:21.360 align:start position:0%
uh around using deadly force when a
 
01:59:23.669 --> 01:59:23.679 align:start position:0%
person is fleeing
 
01:59:23.679 --> 01:59:24.629 align:start position:0%
person is fleeing
so

01:59:24.629 --> 01:59:24.639 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:59:27.750 --> 01:59:27.760 align:start position:0%
um i i would ask you to sort of help me
 
01:59:29.669 --> 01:59:29.679 align:start position:0%
understand directly what
 
01:59:32.470 --> 01:59:32.480 align:start position:0%
in the bill is is accomplishing
 
01:59:34.870 --> 01:59:34.880 align:start position:0%
what you're what what the case that you
 
01:59:40.229 --> 01:59:40.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:40.239 --> 01:59:44.070 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:59:44.070 --> 01:59:44.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:46.870 --> 01:59:46.880 align:start position:0%
so in line well i don't have the uh
 
01:59:48.790 --> 01:59:48.800 align:start position:0%
written bill but it's uh
 
01:59:50.870 --> 01:59:50.880 align:start position:0%
part two
 
01:59:53.430 --> 01:59:53.440 align:start position:0%
uh part two b
 
01:59:56.070 --> 01:59:56.080 align:start position:0%
two where it says
 
01:59:59.109 --> 01:59:59.119 align:start position:0%
um current law says he had made
 
02:00:01.270 --> 02:00:01.280 align:start position:0%
reasonable efforts to advise advise the
 
02:00:02.950 --> 02:00:02.960 align:start position:0%
person that he is a law enforcement
 
02:00:05.109 --> 02:00:05.119 align:start position:0%
officer attempting to in effect an
 
02:00:06.950 --> 02:00:06.960 align:start position:0%
arrest in his reasonable grounds to
 
02:00:08.470 --> 02:00:08.480 align:start position:0%
believe that person is aware of these
 
02:00:08.480 --> 02:00:10.070 align:start position:0%
believe that person is aware of these
facts

02:00:10.070 --> 02:00:10.080 align:start position:0%
facts
 
02:00:10.080 --> 02:00:11.430 align:start position:0%
facts
um

02:00:11.430 --> 02:00:11.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:00:12.709 --> 02:00:12.719 align:start position:0%
taking out
 
02:00:15.350 --> 02:00:15.360 align:start position:0%
or i should use the the higher level
 
02:00:16.550 --> 02:00:16.560 align:start position:0%
part b
 
02:00:18.390 --> 02:00:18.400 align:start position:0%
or part two b
 
02:00:20.950 --> 02:00:20.960 align:start position:0%
to affect an arrest
 
02:00:23.189 --> 02:00:23.199 align:start position:0%
or prevent the escape from custody of a
 
02:00:23.199 --> 02:00:24.390 align:start position:0%
or prevent the escape from custody of a
person

02:00:24.390 --> 02:00:24.400 align:start position:0%
person
 
02:00:28.070 --> 02:00:28.080 align:start position:0%
whom he reasonably believes so we're
 
02:00:30.149 --> 02:00:30.159 align:start position:0%
those are the two
 
02:00:32.790 --> 02:00:32.800 align:start position:0%
options parts uh one and two
 
02:00:35.510 --> 02:00:35.520 align:start position:0%
uh b1 and b2
 
02:00:35.520 --> 02:00:36.550 align:start position:0%
uh b1 and b2
um

02:00:36.550 --> 02:00:36.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:00:39.510 --> 02:00:39.520 align:start position:0%
b2 where he's allowed to use deadly
 
02:00:42.310 --> 02:00:42.320 align:start position:0%
force just because the person is running
 
02:00:42.320 --> 02:00:43.270 align:start position:0%
force just because the person is running
away

02:00:43.270 --> 02:00:43.280 align:start position:0%
away
 
02:00:44.870 --> 02:00:44.880 align:start position:0%
the courts have said that we can't
 
02:00:46.629 --> 02:00:46.639 align:start position:0%
authorize that power
 
02:00:49.750 --> 02:00:49.760 align:start position:0%
if the felon is using a weapon if
 
02:00:51.910 --> 02:00:51.920 align:start position:0%
they're attacking someone if they take a
 
02:00:54.950 --> 02:00:54.960 align:start position:0%
hostage if they steal a car
 
02:00:54.960 --> 02:00:56.310 align:start position:0%
hostage if they steal a car
um

02:00:56.310 --> 02:00:56.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:00:58.470 --> 02:00:58.480 align:start position:0%
if they're driving away recklessly or
 
02:01:00.470 --> 02:01:00.480 align:start position:0%
any number of circumstances
 
02:01:00.480 --> 02:01:01.750 align:start position:0%
any number of circumstances
um

02:01:01.750 --> 02:01:01.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:01:04.070 --> 02:01:04.080 align:start position:0%
anything where they might in what's left
 
02:01:05.109 --> 02:01:05.119 align:start position:0%
in the
 
02:01:07.430 --> 02:01:07.440 align:start position:0%
statute under this bill is likely to
 
02:01:09.750 --> 02:01:09.760 align:start position:0%
seriously endanger human life friends or
 
02:01:11.510 --> 02:01:11.520 align:start position:0%
inflict serious bodily injury unless
 
02:01:13.750 --> 02:01:13.760 align:start position:0%
apprehended without delay the officer
 
02:01:15.830 --> 02:01:15.840 align:start position:0%
would still be allowed to use
 
02:01:18.310 --> 02:01:18.320 align:start position:0%
deadly force under those circumstances
 
02:01:19.750 --> 02:01:19.760 align:start position:0%
but not
 
02:01:21.669 --> 02:01:21.679 align:start position:0%
just to arrest someone who is just
 
02:01:23.189 --> 02:01:23.199 align:start position:0%
running away
 
02:01:26.070 --> 02:01:26.080 align:start position:0%
so in the garner case where the officer
 
02:01:28.950 --> 02:01:28.960 align:start position:0%
shot the 15 year old
 
02:01:28.960 --> 02:01:31.109 align:start position:0%
shot the 15 year old
um

02:01:31.109 --> 02:01:31.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:01:32.709 --> 02:01:32.719 align:start position:0%
the facts in the case and the
 
02:01:34.709 --> 02:01:34.719 align:start position:0%
conclusions made at the the trial court
 
02:01:36.950 --> 02:01:36.960 align:start position:0%
level were that
 
02:01:38.950 --> 02:01:38.960 align:start position:0%
it was not established in any way shape
 
02:01:41.430 --> 02:01:41.440 align:start position:0%
or form that the 15 year old was
 
02:01:43.910 --> 02:01:43.920 align:start position:0%
otherwise endangering anyone else simply
 
02:01:46.470 --> 02:01:46.480 align:start position:0%
running away trying to escape arrest
 
02:01:48.950 --> 02:01:48.960 align:start position:0%
so that was the very narrow issue looked
 
02:01:51.669 --> 02:01:51.679 align:start position:0%
at under tennessee versus garden and
 
02:01:54.629 --> 02:01:54.639 align:start position:0%
like i say by a six to three decision
 
02:01:57.830 --> 02:01:57.840 align:start position:0%
they decided that we're not allowed to
 
02:02:00.149 --> 02:02:00.159 align:start position:0%
authorize deadly force
 
02:02:00.159 --> 02:02:01.030 align:start position:0%
authorize deadly force
just

02:02:01.030 --> 02:02:01.040 align:start position:0%
just
 
02:02:03.189 --> 02:02:03.199 align:start position:0%
to enforce
 
02:02:05.510 --> 02:02:05.520 align:start position:0%
our laws just to stop someone from
 
02:02:12.870 --> 02:02:12.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:14.870 --> 02:02:14.880 align:start position:0%
representative wallace
 
02:02:16.229 --> 02:02:16.239 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you
 
02:02:17.910 --> 02:02:17.920 align:start position:0%
representative davidson for taking my
 
02:02:17.920 --> 02:02:18.790 align:start position:0%
representative davidson for taking my
question

02:02:18.790 --> 02:02:18.800 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:02:20.950 --> 02:02:20.960 align:start position:0%
um has there been any recent history in
 
02:02:22.390 --> 02:02:22.400 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
02:02:22.400 --> 02:02:23.830 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
with

02:02:23.830 --> 02:02:23.840 align:start position:0%
with
 
02:02:25.669 --> 02:02:25.679 align:start position:0%
attempted arrests that have
 
02:02:27.109 --> 02:02:27.119 align:start position:0%
turned into situations that this bill
 
02:02:31.589 --> 02:02:31.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:31.599 --> 02:02:32.870 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:02:32.870 --> 02:02:32.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:02:34.790 --> 02:02:34.800 align:start position:0%
that's a good question um i don't know
 
02:02:36.870 --> 02:02:36.880 align:start position:0%
of any off the top of my head i know of
 
02:02:39.430 --> 02:02:39.440 align:start position:0%
uh a few cases from from quite a few
 
02:02:41.270 --> 02:02:41.280 align:start position:0%
years back but i don't know of anything
 
02:02:41.280 --> 02:02:43.750 align:start position:0%
years back but i don't know of anything
reason

02:02:43.750 --> 02:02:43.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:46.870 --> 02:02:46.880 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:02:49.669 --> 02:02:49.679 align:start position:0%
representative newman
 
02:02:51.430 --> 02:02:51.440 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you
 
02:02:54.149 --> 02:02:54.159 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question
 
02:02:54.159 --> 02:02:55.990 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question
um

02:02:55.990 --> 02:02:56.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:02:57.589 --> 02:02:57.599 align:start position:0%
my question is
 
02:02:59.830 --> 02:02:59.840 align:start position:0%
similar to what
 
02:03:02.470 --> 02:03:02.480 align:start position:0%
representative muse was asking
 
02:03:02.480 --> 02:03:03.350 align:start position:0%
representative muse was asking
and

02:03:03.350 --> 02:03:03.360 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:03:05.830 --> 02:03:05.840 align:start position:0%
i i guess my question to you would be
 
02:03:08.470 --> 02:03:08.480 align:start position:0%
you talked about a court case you said
 
02:03:10.310 --> 02:03:10.320 align:start position:0%
the court case said that our law was
 
02:03:10.320 --> 02:03:12.310 align:start position:0%
the court case said that our law was
unconstitutional

02:03:12.310 --> 02:03:12.320 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional
 
02:03:14.950 --> 02:03:14.960 align:start position:0%
and you keep mentioning running away you
 
02:03:17.430 --> 02:03:17.440 align:start position:0%
can't do it running away
 
02:03:19.189 --> 02:03:19.199 align:start position:0%
do you have a court case or did that
 
02:03:22.310 --> 02:03:22.320 align:start position:0%
court case say it was unconstitutional
 
02:03:24.550 --> 02:03:24.560 align:start position:0%
for an officer to use force when
 
02:03:26.709 --> 02:03:26.719 align:start position:0%
affecting an arrest because that's the
 
02:03:28.470 --> 02:03:28.480 align:start position:0%
only thing i'm seeing removed from this
 
02:03:28.480 --> 02:03:31.669 align:start position:0%
only thing i'm seeing removed from this
bill

02:03:31.669 --> 02:03:31.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:34.390 --> 02:03:34.400 align:start position:0%
yes that's the narrow scope of tennessee
 
02:03:35.750 --> 02:03:35.760 align:start position:0%
versus garner
 
02:03:38.550 --> 02:03:38.560 align:start position:0%
uh tennessee versus garner 1985.
 
02:03:40.550 --> 02:03:40.560 align:start position:0%
um i emailed you
 
02:03:42.709 --> 02:03:42.719 align:start position:0%
the relevant uh
 
02:03:44.790 --> 02:03:44.800 align:start position:0%
text from that case
 
02:03:47.430 --> 02:03:47.440 align:start position:0%
uh last night at 509 pm it might be in
 
02:03:50.149 --> 02:03:50.159 align:start position:0%
your it should be in your email inbox my
 
02:03:52.790 --> 02:03:52.800 align:start position:0%
email sometimes go into people's uh
 
02:03:54.950 --> 02:03:54.960 align:start position:0%
spam folder or book folder
 
02:03:58.550 --> 02:03:58.560 align:start position:0%
you know one of those subfolders um but
 
02:03:58.560 --> 02:03:59.669 align:start position:0%
you know one of those subfolders um but
uh

02:03:59.669 --> 02:03:59.679 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:04:01.669 --> 02:04:01.679 align:start position:0%
the text of that case tennessee versus
 
02:04:01.679 --> 02:04:02.629 align:start position:0%
the text of that case tennessee versus
garner

02:04:02.629 --> 02:04:02.639 align:start position:0%
garner
 
02:04:05.030 --> 02:04:05.040 align:start position:0%
um has not been overturned so that that
 
02:04:07.189 --> 02:04:07.199 align:start position:0%
case is still the law of the land
 
02:04:09.750 --> 02:04:09.760 align:start position:0%
um and this wording that we're trying to
 
02:04:09.760 --> 02:04:11.350 align:start position:0%
um and this wording that we're trying to
delete

02:04:11.350 --> 02:04:11.360 align:start position:0%
delete
 
02:04:14.149 --> 02:04:14.159 align:start position:0%
was kind of singled out by the court as
 
02:04:15.589 --> 02:04:15.599 align:start position:0%
something that states are not allowed to
 
02:04:15.599 --> 02:04:19.830 align:start position:0%
something that states are not allowed to
do

02:04:19.830 --> 02:04:19.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:22.950 --> 02:04:22.960 align:start position:0%
representative question
 
02:04:26.790 --> 02:04:26.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:30.310 --> 02:04:30.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:31.270 --> 02:04:31.280 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:04:31.280 --> 02:04:32.470 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

02:04:32.470 --> 02:04:32.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:04:34.149 --> 02:04:34.159 align:start position:0%
and thank you for pointing me back to
 
02:04:37.910 --> 02:04:37.920 align:start position:0%
that email i'll go and find it and um
 
02:04:37.920 --> 02:04:39.589 align:start position:0%
that email i'll go and find it and um
so

02:04:39.589 --> 02:04:39.599 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:04:41.350 --> 02:04:41.360 align:start position:0%
my question is do you just do you
 
02:04:43.589 --> 02:04:43.599 align:start position:0%
recollect at all whether those exact
 
02:04:45.189 --> 02:04:45.199 align:start position:0%
words that you're removing from this
 
02:04:45.199 --> 02:04:46.550 align:start position:0%
words that you're removing from this
document

02:04:46.550 --> 02:04:46.560 align:start position:0%
document
 
02:04:48.790 --> 02:04:48.800 align:start position:0%
were mentioned in that court review if
 
02:04:53.510 --> 02:04:53.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:56.229 --> 02:04:56.239 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire statute was mentioned
 
02:04:58.950 --> 02:04:58.960 align:start position:0%
um and then the the
 
02:05:00.870 --> 02:05:00.880 align:start position:0%
when you find the email has the the
 
02:05:02.950 --> 02:05:02.960 align:start position:0%
exact quote see if i
 
02:05:04.149 --> 02:05:04.159 align:start position:0%
still have it
 
02:05:04.159 --> 02:05:07.350 align:start position:0%
still have it
um

02:05:07.350 --> 02:05:07.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:09.030 --> 02:05:09.040 align:start position:0%
which says the tennessee statute is
 
02:05:10.709 --> 02:05:10.719 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional insofar as it
 
02:05:13.109 --> 02:05:13.119 align:start position:0%
authorizes the use of deadly force
 
02:05:15.990 --> 02:05:16.000 align:start position:0%
against such fleeing suspects um if you
 
02:05:17.189 --> 02:05:17.199 align:start position:0%
do want to read the whole case it's a
 
02:05:19.189 --> 02:05:19.199 align:start position:0%
few pages long but it does
 
02:05:19.199 --> 02:05:20.390 align:start position:0%
few pages long but it does
uh

02:05:20.390 --> 02:05:20.400 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:05:20.400 --> 02:05:21.510 align:start position:0%
uh
state

02:05:21.510 --> 02:05:21.520 align:start position:0%
state
 
02:05:24.149 --> 02:05:24.159 align:start position:0%
that a state is allowed to authorize
 
02:05:27.430 --> 02:05:27.440 align:start position:0%
deadly force if the felon is creating
 
02:05:29.350 --> 02:05:29.360 align:start position:0%
some type of imminent danger around them
 
02:05:30.390 --> 02:05:30.400 align:start position:0%
at the time
 
02:05:32.950 --> 02:05:32.960 align:start position:0%
but not for simply running away so if
 
02:05:34.870 --> 02:05:34.880 align:start position:0%
they have a weapon in their hand
 
02:05:36.709 --> 02:05:36.719 align:start position:0%
or they're trying to steal a car commit
 
02:05:41.030 --> 02:05:41.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:43.270 --> 02:05:43.280 align:start position:0%
you know we can allow police we can
 
02:05:46.310 --> 02:05:46.320 align:start position:0%
authorize police officers to
 
02:05:48.470 --> 02:05:48.480 align:start position:0%
shoot a suspect if they're doing
 
02:05:51.109 --> 02:05:51.119 align:start position:0%
something else that endangers the public
 
02:05:53.270 --> 02:05:53.280 align:start position:0%
um trying to set fire to something or
 
02:05:55.189 --> 02:05:55.199 align:start position:0%
shooting back or
 
02:05:57.270 --> 02:05:57.280 align:start position:0%
throwing a weapon or object but not
 
02:06:00.390 --> 02:06:00.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:05.030 --> 02:06:05.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:07.910 --> 02:06:07.920 align:start position:0%
if i may ask a question um
 
02:06:09.589 --> 02:06:09.599 align:start position:0%
they can take my question
 
02:06:13.189 --> 02:06:13.199 align:start position:0%
so tennessee versus garner
 
02:06:15.270 --> 02:06:15.280 align:start position:0%
known as what we you know often refers
 
02:06:17.589 --> 02:06:17.599 align:start position:0%
to the fleet and felon doctrine where my
 
02:06:20.229 --> 02:06:20.239 align:start position:0%
understanding the fact that the
 
02:06:22.470 --> 02:06:22.480 align:start position:0%
victim was simply just fleeing and was
 
02:06:23.750 --> 02:06:23.760 align:start position:0%
shot in the back
 
02:06:23.760 --> 02:06:25.270 align:start position:0%
shot in the back
uh

02:06:25.270 --> 02:06:25.280 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:06:27.669 --> 02:06:27.679 align:start position:0%
you didn't say that if if
 
02:06:30.229 --> 02:06:30.239 align:start position:0%
it would require something additional to
 
02:06:32.310 --> 02:06:32.320 align:start position:0%
justify the use of deadly force when
 
02:06:33.910 --> 02:06:33.920 align:start position:0%
affecting the rest
 
02:06:36.229 --> 02:06:36.239 align:start position:0%
i understand this as
 
02:06:36.239 --> 02:06:37.430 align:start position:0%
i understand this as
written

02:06:37.430 --> 02:06:37.440 align:start position:0%
written
 
02:06:39.510 --> 02:06:39.520 align:start position:0%
is using a deadly weapon and attempting
 
02:06:40.790 --> 02:06:40.800 align:start position:0%
to escape
 
02:06:40.800 --> 02:06:41.990 align:start position:0%
to escape
so

02:06:41.990 --> 02:06:42.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:06:42.000 --> 02:06:42.830 align:start position:0%
so
i

02:06:42.830 --> 02:06:42.840 align:start position:0%
i
 
02:06:44.390 --> 02:06:44.400 align:start position:0%
distinguish i'm just asking the
 
02:06:45.990 --> 02:06:46.000 align:start position:0%
agreement you just i distinguished new
 
02:06:48.069 --> 02:06:48.079 align:start position:0%
hampshire's law to require that
 
02:06:48.079 --> 02:06:49.270 align:start position:0%
hampshire's law to require that
additional

02:06:49.270 --> 02:06:49.280 align:start position:0%
additional
 
02:06:50.709 --> 02:06:50.719 align:start position:0%
deadly weapon to be involved in the
 
02:06:53.030 --> 02:06:53.040 align:start position:0%
escape which is not what what the
 
02:06:54.709 --> 02:06:54.719 align:start position:0%
circumstances were in tennessee versus
 
02:06:56.229 --> 02:06:56.239 align:start position:0%
guard i'm not sure if you agree with
 
02:06:56.239 --> 02:06:57.030 align:start position:0%
guard i'm not sure if you agree with
that

02:06:57.030 --> 02:06:57.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:07:00.709 --> 02:07:00.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:03.750 --> 02:07:03.760 align:start position:0%
uh my reading of the statute is
 
02:07:03.760 --> 02:07:05.109 align:start position:0%
uh my reading of the statute is
um

02:07:05.109 --> 02:07:05.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:07:07.910 --> 02:07:07.920 align:start position:0%
that the
 
02:07:09.990 --> 02:07:10.000 align:start position:0%
it it's an it's an
 
02:07:11.990 --> 02:07:12.000 align:start position:0%
or situation
 
02:07:12.000 --> 02:07:13.109 align:start position:0%
or situation
um

02:07:13.109 --> 02:07:13.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:07:15.430 --> 02:07:15.440 align:start position:0%
as i've read it 625
 
02:07:18.229 --> 02:07:18.239 align:start position:0%
627 section 5. uh if you think i'm wrong
 
02:07:20.470 --> 02:07:20.480 align:start position:0%
uh it is your decision i'm not on your
 
02:07:22.229 --> 02:07:22.239 align:start position:0%
committee but
 
02:07:22.239 --> 02:07:24.470 align:start position:0%
committee but
um

02:07:24.470 --> 02:07:24.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:07:26.310 --> 02:07:26.320 align:start position:0%
it currently says that they're simply
 
02:07:27.910 --> 02:07:27.920 align:start position:0%
running away
 
02:07:30.390 --> 02:07:30.400 align:start position:0%
my reading of the bill is it says if the
 
02:07:31.750 --> 02:07:31.760 align:start position:0%
person is simply
 
02:07:33.510 --> 02:07:33.520 align:start position:0%
running away from the person that the
 
02:07:35.350 --> 02:07:35.360 align:start position:0%
officer has the right
 
02:07:35.360 --> 02:07:36.310 align:start position:0%
officer has the right
to

02:07:36.310 --> 02:07:36.320 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:07:41.109 --> 02:07:41.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:42.550 --> 02:07:42.560 align:start position:0%
let me ask
 
02:07:44.310 --> 02:07:44.320 align:start position:0%
can you point to the line of power where
 
02:07:45.750 --> 02:07:45.760 align:start position:0%
it says that
 
02:07:47.910 --> 02:07:47.920 align:start position:0%
yep that's part two
 
02:07:59.589 --> 02:07:59.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:00.470 --> 02:08:00.480 align:start position:0%
thank you take my question
 
02:08:02.149 --> 02:08:02.159 align:start position:0%
representative wallace
 
02:08:04.709 --> 02:08:04.719 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman uh that's in i
 
02:08:06.870 --> 02:08:06.880 align:start position:0%
believe max's representative abramson is
 
02:08:10.310 --> 02:08:10.320 align:start position:0%
referring to rsa 627
 
02:08:10.320 --> 02:08:13.750 align:start position:0%
referring to rsa 627
5

02:08:13.750 --> 02:08:13.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:16.229 --> 02:08:16.239 align:start position:0%
2 a and b and those two are connected
 
02:08:21.589 --> 02:08:21.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:22.470 --> 02:08:22.480 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:08:26.069 --> 02:08:26.079 align:start position:0%
well i'm saying that uh 627 section 5
 
02:08:27.510 --> 02:08:27.520 align:start position:0%
part 2b
 
02:08:29.669 --> 02:08:29.679 align:start position:0%
parts one and two if you if you read
 
02:08:29.679 --> 02:08:30.550 align:start position:0%
parts one and two if you if you read
them

02:08:30.550 --> 02:08:30.560 align:start position:0%
them
 
02:08:33.510 --> 02:08:33.520 align:start position:0%
um as one kind of it is kind of a long
 
02:08:35.189 --> 02:08:35.199 align:start position:0%
run-on sentence
 
02:08:37.270 --> 02:08:37.280 align:start position:0%
it does appear to authorize
 
02:08:39.189 --> 02:08:39.199 align:start position:0%
the officer
 
02:08:39.199 --> 02:08:40.149 align:start position:0%
the officer
um

02:08:40.149 --> 02:08:40.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:08:42.470 --> 02:08:42.480 align:start position:0%
to shoot a fleeing felon and
 
02:08:42.480 --> 02:08:43.510 align:start position:0%
to shoot a fleeing felon and
um

02:08:43.510 --> 02:08:43.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:08:45.270 --> 02:08:45.280 align:start position:0%
it was uh
 
02:08:47.430 --> 02:08:47.440 align:start position:0%
it was cited as
 
02:08:50.950 --> 02:08:50.960 align:start position:0%
a statute that uh
 
02:08:53.189 --> 02:08:53.199 align:start position:0%
that had that problem
 
02:08:56.629 --> 02:08:56.639 align:start position:0%
if you if you have the rsa books out
 
02:08:58.229 --> 02:08:58.239 align:start position:0%
you can look at when the laws were
 
02:09:00.310 --> 02:09:00.320 align:start position:0%
actually amended
 
02:09:03.589 --> 02:09:03.599 align:start position:0%
there was an amendment made in 1981
 
02:09:05.669 --> 02:09:05.679 align:start position:0%
another one in 1981
 
02:09:07.350 --> 02:09:07.360 align:start position:0%
uh and another in
 
02:09:10.390 --> 02:09:10.400 align:start position:0%
uh 2020 so last session
 
02:09:10.400 --> 02:09:11.830 align:start position:0%
uh 2020 so last session
um

02:09:11.830 --> 02:09:11.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:09:13.750 --> 02:09:13.760 align:start position:0%
but i don't believe that
 
02:09:15.109 --> 02:09:15.119 align:start position:0%
i think that that was a chokehold
 
02:09:17.669 --> 02:09:17.679 align:start position:0%
position uh provision but i i don't
 
02:09:19.750 --> 02:09:19.760 align:start position:0%
think that uh there was nothing made
 
02:09:22.069 --> 02:09:22.079 align:start position:0%
between tennessee versus garner and
 
02:09:22.079 --> 02:09:24.550 align:start position:0%
between tennessee versus garner and
today

02:09:24.550 --> 02:09:24.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:24.560 --> 02:09:27.910 align:start position:0%
 
so

02:09:27.910 --> 02:09:27.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:34.950 --> 02:09:34.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:36.790 --> 02:09:36.800 align:start position:0%
thank you see seeing no further hands
 
02:09:36.800 --> 02:09:38.709 align:start position:0%
thank you see seeing no further hands
raised

02:09:38.709 --> 02:09:38.719 align:start position:0%
raised
 
02:09:51.430 --> 02:09:51.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:54.629 --> 02:09:54.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:58.069 --> 02:09:58.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:06.709 --> 02:10:06.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:09.030 --> 02:10:09.040 align:start position:0%
good morning
 
02:10:12.390 --> 02:10:12.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:14.870 --> 02:10:14.880 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you all thank you all for the
 
02:10:16.629 --> 02:10:16.639 align:start position:0%
recognition i am a um
 
02:10:18.149 --> 02:10:18.159 align:start position:0%
board member my name's christine list
 
02:10:19.990 --> 02:10:20.000 align:start position:0%
i'm a board member for the new hampshire
 
02:10:21.510 --> 02:10:21.520 align:start position:0%
association of the criminal defense
 
02:10:23.750 --> 02:10:23.760 align:start position:0%
lawyers i'm here in that capacity today
 
02:10:25.270 --> 02:10:25.280 align:start position:0%
i've been a criminal defense attorney in
 
02:10:27.669 --> 02:10:27.679 align:start position:0%
the state for about 13 years 10 of that
 
02:10:29.350 --> 02:10:29.360 align:start position:0%
with the public defender's office before
 
02:10:32.069 --> 02:10:32.079 align:start position:0%
moving into the private practice
 
02:10:34.069 --> 02:10:34.079 align:start position:0%
i would like to speak on this bill
 
02:10:36.149 --> 02:10:36.159 align:start position:0%
because overall it sets out the
 
02:10:38.870 --> 02:10:38.880 align:start position:0%
framework for when new hampshire
 
02:10:40.950 --> 02:10:40.960 align:start position:0%
thinks it's okay thinks it's permissible
 
02:10:43.510 --> 02:10:43.520 align:start position:0%
and justified for a police officer
 
02:10:45.750 --> 02:10:45.760 align:start position:0%
to kill a citizen of the state
 
02:10:47.430 --> 02:10:47.440 align:start position:0%
that's what we're talking about and i do
 
02:10:50.310 --> 02:10:50.320 align:start position:0%
think what we need to focus on is this
 
02:10:53.669 --> 02:10:53.679 align:start position:0%
the bill as a as it's proposed hb66
 
02:10:55.830 --> 02:10:55.840 align:start position:0%
eliminates the ability to kill someone
 
02:10:58.470 --> 02:10:58.480 align:start position:0%
solely to effectuate the arrest it
 
02:10:59.990 --> 02:11:00.000 align:start position:0%
leaves in place all the other
 
02:11:02.229 --> 02:11:02.239 align:start position:0%
protections that officers have with
 
02:11:03.830 --> 02:11:03.840 align:start position:0%
regard to um
 
02:11:05.350 --> 02:11:05.360 align:start position:0%
interactions with
 
02:11:08.870 --> 02:11:08.880 align:start position:0%
during an arrest particularly look
 
02:11:11.830 --> 02:11:11.840 align:start position:0%
section one of 627.5 they're still
 
02:11:14.550 --> 02:11:14.560 align:start position:0%
permitted to use other ports um when
 
02:11:15.990 --> 02:11:16.000 align:start position:0%
we're talking about
 
02:11:18.870 --> 02:11:18.880 align:start position:0%
lethal force deadly force i was thrilled
 
02:11:20.550 --> 02:11:20.560 align:start position:0%
to hear this introduced as a pro law
 
02:11:22.470 --> 02:11:22.480 align:start position:0%
enforcement bill because i agree that it
 
02:11:22.480 --> 02:11:23.510 align:start position:0%
enforcement bill because i agree that it
is

02:11:23.510 --> 02:11:23.520 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:11:26.229 --> 02:11:26.239 align:start position:0%
we put our officers in very difficult
 
02:11:29.270 --> 02:11:29.280 align:start position:0%
situations we train them very well
 
02:11:31.030 --> 02:11:31.040 align:start position:0%
i'm speaking with officers around the
 
02:11:33.350 --> 02:11:33.360 align:start position:0%
state in the last few years as the
 
02:11:35.750 --> 02:11:35.760 align:start position:0%
reforms have been discussed many of them
 
02:11:38.470 --> 02:11:38.480 align:start position:0%
are in support of reforms um and
 
02:11:40.390 --> 02:11:40.400 align:start position:0%
de-escalation and further trainings in
 
02:11:43.830 --> 02:11:43.840 align:start position:0%
that they want to be able to reserve
 
02:11:46.390 --> 02:11:46.400 align:start position:0%
legal lethal force when it's absolutely
 
02:11:48.629 --> 02:11:48.639 align:start position:0%
necessary let's admit that it is never
 
02:11:51.750 --> 02:11:51.760 align:start position:0%
necessary in order to solely effectuate
 
02:11:53.030 --> 02:11:53.040 align:start position:0%
an arrest
 
02:11:53.040 --> 02:11:53.910 align:start position:0%
an arrest
um

02:11:53.910 --> 02:11:53.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:11:55.830 --> 02:11:55.840 align:start position:0%
when we talk about
 
02:11:55.840 --> 02:11:56.629 align:start position:0%
when we talk about
the

02:11:56.629 --> 02:11:56.639 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:11:58.390 --> 02:11:58.400 align:start position:0%
process where
 
02:12:00.550 --> 02:12:00.560 align:start position:0%
the bill as it stands the law as it
 
02:12:01.830 --> 02:12:01.840 align:start position:0%
stands now
 
02:12:04.830 --> 02:12:04.840 align:start position:0%
a law allows an officer
 
02:12:08.709 --> 02:12:08.719 align:start position:0%
to kill a citizen who if the arrest had
 
02:12:10.629 --> 02:12:10.639 align:start position:0%
gone forward and if the arrest was
 
02:12:12.790 --> 02:12:12.800 align:start position:0%
successful they'd been brought before a
 
02:12:15.030 --> 02:12:15.040 align:start position:0%
judge a judge then makes a determination
 
02:12:16.550 --> 02:12:16.560 align:start position:0%
about whether or not that person is
 
02:12:18.390 --> 02:12:18.400 align:start position:0%
dangerous and can stay in the community
 
02:12:21.270 --> 02:12:21.280 align:start position:0%
facing charges the law as it's written
 
02:12:23.350 --> 02:12:23.360 align:start position:0%
the category of crimes for which an
 
02:12:25.990 --> 02:12:26.000 align:start position:0%
officer would be justified in killing
 
02:12:27.830 --> 02:12:27.840 align:start position:0%
during an arrest
 
02:12:31.109 --> 02:12:31.119 align:start position:0%
most covers most of our assault statute
 
02:12:33.189 --> 02:12:33.199 align:start position:0%
and it is often that people charged with
 
02:12:34.790 --> 02:12:34.800 align:start position:0%
those crimes appear in front of a judge
 
02:12:36.310 --> 02:12:36.320 align:start position:0%
and are released on their own personal
 
02:12:36.320 --> 02:12:37.990 align:start position:0%
and are released on their own personal
recognition

02:12:37.990 --> 02:12:38.000 align:start position:0%
recognition
 
02:12:39.990 --> 02:12:40.000 align:start position:0%
this law as it's written allows an
 
02:12:43.669 --> 02:12:43.679 align:start position:0%
officer to take that snapshot
 
02:12:43.679 --> 02:12:44.790 align:start position:0%
officer to take that snapshot
and

02:12:44.790 --> 02:12:44.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:12:48.149 --> 02:12:48.159 align:start position:0%
look solely at am i arresting a person
 
02:12:50.470 --> 02:12:50.480 align:start position:0%
and is it necessary for me to kill this
 
02:12:52.870 --> 02:12:52.880 align:start position:0%
person in order to arrest them without
 
02:12:54.550 --> 02:12:54.560 align:start position:0%
any other analysis
 
02:12:56.550 --> 02:12:56.560 align:start position:0%
of whether they pose a future risk
 
02:12:58.629 --> 02:12:58.639 align:start position:0%
whether they pose a current risk because
 
02:13:00.709 --> 02:13:00.719 align:start position:0%
if they do that other parts of the
 
02:13:02.629 --> 02:13:02.639 align:start position:0%
statute kick in and authorize the
 
02:13:04.390 --> 02:13:04.400 align:start position:0%
officer to take the actions they believe
 
02:13:06.709 --> 02:13:06.719 align:start position:0%
are necessary there are other safeguards
 
02:13:09.669 --> 02:13:09.679 align:start position:0%
in place what this amendment i
 
02:13:12.550 --> 02:13:12.560 align:start position:0%
believe is intended to do is eliminate
 
02:13:15.430 --> 02:13:15.440 align:start position:0%
the ability to have a very tunnel vision
 
02:13:18.310 --> 02:13:18.320 align:start position:0%
analysis of am i arresting
 
02:13:20.629 --> 02:13:20.639 align:start position:0%
do i think it's apparently necessary and
 
02:13:22.149 --> 02:13:22.159 align:start position:0%
apparently actually appears in the
 
02:13:25.030 --> 02:13:25.040 align:start position:0%
statute apparently necessary to
 
02:13:26.950 --> 02:13:26.960 align:start position:0%
effectuate this arrest
 
02:13:29.350 --> 02:13:29.360 align:start position:0%
that we as a society should not condone
 
02:13:31.830 --> 02:13:31.840 align:start position:0%
lethal force in that situation
 
02:13:33.189 --> 02:13:33.199 align:start position:0%
i would like to speak just to the
 
02:13:35.830 --> 02:13:35.840 align:start position:0%
question that was raised about um the
 
02:13:37.950 --> 02:13:37.960 align:start position:0%
elimination of rsa
 
02:13:40.709 --> 02:13:40.719 align:start position:0%
627-58 i believe that when
 
02:13:43.430 --> 02:13:43.440 align:start position:0%
read in connection with the elimination
 
02:13:45.750 --> 02:13:45.760 align:start position:0%
of to effectuate arrest that is crossed
 
02:13:45.760 --> 02:13:46.550 align:start position:0%
of to effectuate arrest that is crossed
out

02:13:46.550 --> 02:13:46.560 align:start position:0%
out
 
02:13:49.189 --> 02:13:49.199 align:start position:0%
um eight would really no
 
02:13:50.870 --> 02:13:50.880 align:start position:0%
um purpose
 
02:13:52.149 --> 02:13:52.159 align:start position:0%
if the
 
02:13:54.149 --> 02:13:54.159 align:start position:0%
to effectuate arrest is crossed out it
 
02:13:55.910 --> 02:13:55.920 align:start position:0%
essentially takes out all of the
 
02:13:58.790 --> 02:13:58.800 align:start position:0%
references to when it is reasonable
 
02:14:00.229 --> 02:14:00.239 align:start position:0%
and again
 
02:14:02.870 --> 02:14:02.880 align:start position:0%
really opens it up to the officer making
 
02:14:05.589 --> 02:14:05.599 align:start position:0%
a current analysis of the situation a
 
02:14:07.589 --> 02:14:07.599 align:start position:0%
current analysis of the risk posed by
 
02:14:08.950 --> 02:14:08.960 align:start position:0%
that person
 
02:14:10.790 --> 02:14:10.800 align:start position:0%
rather than being able to as been
 
02:14:13.030 --> 02:14:13.040 align:start position:0%
mentioned and as we've seen around the
 
02:14:15.109 --> 02:14:15.119 align:start position:0%
nation and the last um
 
02:14:18.310 --> 02:14:18.320 align:start position:0%
increasingly in the last few years
 
02:14:19.910 --> 02:14:19.920 align:start position:0%
people being shot in the back as they're
 
02:14:21.589 --> 02:14:21.599 align:start position:0%
fleeing when someone's trying to
 
02:14:23.910 --> 02:14:23.920 align:start position:0%
effectuate an arrest i
 
02:14:25.750 --> 02:14:25.760 align:start position:0%
don't discount that there are difficult
 
02:14:28.149 --> 02:14:28.159 align:start position:0%
analysis to be made um i believe it was
 
02:14:29.589 --> 02:14:29.599 align:start position:0%
raised you know when someone takes a
 
02:14:31.510 --> 02:14:31.520 align:start position:0%
taser is that
 
02:14:35.350 --> 02:14:35.360 align:start position:0%
are we permitted to use lethal force um
 
02:14:37.669 --> 02:14:37.679 align:start position:0%
there's no go not going to be a bright
 
02:14:39.669 --> 02:14:39.679 align:start position:0%
line rule that covers every situation
 
02:14:41.669 --> 02:14:41.679 align:start position:0%
that my clients and officers find
 
02:14:44.069 --> 02:14:44.079 align:start position:0%
themselves in on a on a potentially
 
02:14:46.470 --> 02:14:46.480 align:start position:0%
daily basis but when we're talking about
 
02:14:49.669 --> 02:14:49.679 align:start position:0%
a blanket permission to use lethal force
 
02:14:51.990 --> 02:14:52.000 align:start position:0%
solely for an arrest it values the
 
02:14:53.910 --> 02:14:53.920 align:start position:0%
arrest over the human life and submit
 
02:14:55.430 --> 02:14:55.440 align:start position:0%
that that is not a place that new
 
02:14:57.189 --> 02:14:57.199 align:start position:0%
hampshire wants to be and not how we
 
02:14:59.830 --> 02:14:59.840 align:start position:0%
treat our citizens or our officer
 
02:15:02.149 --> 02:15:02.159 align:start position:0%
and so for that reason
 
02:15:15.990 --> 02:15:16.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:18.470 --> 02:15:18.480 align:start position:0%
see no questions
 
02:15:20.069 --> 02:15:20.079 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony
 
02:15:25.510 --> 02:15:25.520 align:start position:0%

i pretty much agree with most of
 
02:16:23.030 --> 02:16:23.040 align:start position:0%
everything that's been said especially
 
02:16:24.390 --> 02:16:24.400 align:start position:0%
counselor list and the other
 
02:16:27.589 --> 02:16:27.599 align:start position:0%
representatives who testified um i think
 
02:16:27.599 --> 02:16:28.709 align:start position:0%
representatives who testified um i think
that

02:16:28.709 --> 02:16:28.719 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:16:30.470 --> 02:16:30.480 align:start position:0%
the the section 8 that has been
 
02:16:32.790 --> 02:16:32.800 align:start position:0%
discussed um
 
02:16:34.950 --> 02:16:34.960 align:start position:0%
deadly force shall be deemed
 
02:16:36.469 --> 02:16:36.479 align:start position:0%
deadly force shall be deemed reasonably
 
02:16:38.389 --> 02:16:38.399 align:start position:0%
necessary in this section to prevent
 
02:16:39.589 --> 02:16:39.599 align:start position:0%
whenever the arresting officer
 
02:16:41.270 --> 02:16:41.280 align:start position:0%
reasonably believes the arrest is lawful
 
02:16:42.150 --> 02:16:42.160 align:start position:0%
and there is apparently no other
 
02:16:44.309 --> 02:16:44.319 align:start position:0%
possible means of affecting the arrest i
 
02:16:46.950 --> 02:16:46.960 align:start position:0%
think that goes beyond just uh being in
 
02:16:48.870 --> 02:16:48.880 align:start position:0%
line with removing that is better is
 
02:16:50.629 --> 02:16:50.639 align:start position:0%
more than just being in line with
 
02:16:52.309 --> 02:16:52.319 align:start position:0%
removing affecting arrest in the other
 
02:16:54.950 --> 02:16:54.960 align:start position:0%
sections i think section 8 is is very
 
02:16:56.549 --> 02:16:56.559 align:start position:0%
broad and can give an officer the
 
02:16:58.230 --> 02:16:58.240 align:start position:0%
ability to
 
02:17:00.549 --> 02:17:00.559 align:start position:0%
to use deadly force when they just can't
 
02:17:01.910 --> 02:17:01.920 align:start position:0%
make the arrests in some way are they
 
02:17:03.750 --> 02:17:03.760 align:start position:0%
the only officer on scene without backup
 
02:17:04.950 --> 02:17:04.960 align:start position:0%
or they they feel like they're
 
02:17:06.389 --> 02:17:06.399 align:start position:0%
overpowered and they can't affect the
 
02:17:08.309 --> 02:17:08.319 align:start position:0%
arrest without having to use deadly
 
02:17:10.549 --> 02:17:10.559 align:start position:0%
force it's a very broad uh section of
 
02:17:11.910 --> 02:17:11.920 align:start position:0%
the law and i think that also needs to
 
02:17:14.230 --> 02:17:14.240 align:start position:0%
be removed if you look back at section
 
02:17:17.030 --> 02:17:17.040 align:start position:0%
four it talks about uh under the in the
 
02:17:18.230 --> 02:17:18.240 align:start position:0%
same section
 
02:17:22.070 --> 02:17:22.080 align:start position:0%
uh 27.5 section roman numeral four
 
02:17:24.070 --> 02:17:24.080 align:start position:0%
it talks about uh
 
02:17:26.150 --> 02:17:26.160 align:start position:0%
a private person acting on their own is
 
02:17:28.150 --> 02:17:28.160 align:start position:0%
justified in using non-deadly force upon
 
02:17:30.070 --> 02:17:30.080 align:start position:0%
another went into the extent that he
 
02:17:31.589 --> 02:17:31.599 align:start position:0%
reasonably believes it is necessary to
 
02:17:33.349 --> 02:17:33.359 align:start position:0%
affect or prevent the escape from
 
02:17:35.030 --> 02:17:35.040 align:start position:0%
custody of such other whom he reason
 
02:17:36.950 --> 02:17:36.960 align:start position:0%
believes to have committed a felony and
 
02:17:38.870 --> 02:17:38.880 align:start position:0%
who in fact has committed the felony but
 
02:17:40.469 --> 02:17:40.479 align:start position:0%
he is justified in using deadly force
 
02:17:42.469 --> 02:17:42.479 align:start position:0%
for such purposes only when he reason
 
02:17:43.669 --> 02:17:43.679 align:start position:0%
believes it's necessary to defend
 
02:17:45.429 --> 02:17:45.439 align:start position:0%
himself or third person for what he
 
02:17:46.950 --> 02:17:46.960 align:start position:0%
reason believes to be the imminent use
 
02:17:49.190 --> 02:17:49.200 align:start position:0%
of deadly force so basically a private
 
02:17:51.910 --> 02:17:51.920 align:start position:0%
person can only use deadly force
 
02:17:53.589 --> 02:17:53.599 align:start position:0%
in the same situation a law enforcement
 
02:17:55.349 --> 02:17:55.359 align:start position:0%
officer can if he has to protect his own
 
02:17:57.669 --> 02:17:57.679 align:start position:0%
life or someone else's whereas a police
 
02:17:59.509 --> 02:17:59.519 align:start position:0%
officer does not have that distinction
 
02:18:01.190 --> 02:18:01.200 align:start position:0%
they have a special extra ability we've
 
02:18:03.349 --> 02:18:03.359 align:start position:0%
given them under new hampshire law that
 
02:18:04.950 --> 02:18:04.960 align:start position:0%
they don't need to be in danger or
 
02:18:06.950 --> 02:18:06.960 align:start position:0%
someone else in danger to affect an
 
02:18:09.429 --> 02:18:09.439 align:start position:0%
arrest whereas a private citizen does
 
02:18:11.270 --> 02:18:11.280 align:start position:0%
and also in a self-defense situation if
 
02:18:13.110 --> 02:18:13.120 align:start position:0%
someone tries to break into my house and
 
02:18:14.549 --> 02:18:14.559 align:start position:0%
they have a gun
 
02:18:16.389 --> 02:18:16.399 align:start position:0%
i'd be justified in shooting them in my
 
02:18:18.309 --> 02:18:18.319 align:start position:0%
home and if they're fleeing my house and
 
02:18:19.589 --> 02:18:19.599 align:start position:0%
running away
 
02:18:22.070 --> 02:18:22.080 align:start position:0%
does that same can i still use deadly
 
02:18:23.910 --> 02:18:23.920 align:start position:0%
force to affect an arrest of citizens
 
02:18:26.389 --> 02:18:26.399 align:start position:0%
arrest in that example no i'd probably
 
02:18:27.910 --> 02:18:27.920 align:start position:0%
go to jail if i'm shooting someone who's
 
02:18:29.429 --> 02:18:29.439 align:start position:0%
fleeing the scene and running down my
 
02:18:31.349 --> 02:18:31.359 align:start position:0%
street there was actually a retired law
 
02:18:33.030 --> 02:18:33.040 align:start position:0%
enforcement officer in portsmouth who
 
02:18:35.910 --> 02:18:35.920 align:start position:0%
faced charges for something very similar
 
02:18:37.830 --> 02:18:37.840 align:start position:0%
even a law enforcement officer off duty
 
02:18:39.270 --> 02:18:39.280 align:start position:0%
or retired does not have special
 
02:18:41.509 --> 02:18:41.519 align:start position:0%
privileges to shoot someone fleeing that
 
02:18:43.270 --> 02:18:43.280 align:start position:0%
they're trying to catch
 
02:18:44.469 --> 02:18:44.479 align:start position:0%
and i don't think we should leave that
 
02:18:46.070 --> 02:18:46.080 align:start position:0%
in the law i think this is something
 
02:18:47.669 --> 02:18:47.679 align:start position:0%
that will benefit police officers and
 
02:18:49.110 --> 02:18:49.120 align:start position:0%
law enforcement in general and the
 
02:18:50.549 --> 02:18:50.559 align:start position:0%
public as a whole
 
02:18:52.629 --> 02:18:52.639 align:start position:0%
and i think we need to be very specific
 
02:18:53.669 --> 02:18:53.679 align:start position:0%
as to
 
02:18:55.910 --> 02:18:55.920 align:start position:0%
um you know what is a la who's allowed
 
02:18:57.750 --> 02:18:57.760 align:start position:0%
to kill somebody uh we've already
 
02:18:59.110 --> 02:18:59.120 align:start position:0%
removed the death penalty in new
 
02:19:00.549 --> 02:19:00.559 align:start position:0%
hampshire and i don't think we should
 
02:19:02.070 --> 02:19:02.080 align:start position:0%
leave the death penalty intact for
 
02:19:03.429 --> 02:19:03.439 align:start position:0%
officers who think someone deserves it
 
02:19:06.629 --> 02:19:06.639 align:start position:0%
for not being arrested
 
02:19:14.549 --> 02:19:14.559 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:16.870 --> 02:19:16.880 align:start position:0%
seeing no no hands raised i want to
 
02:19:18.629 --> 02:19:18.639 align:start position:0%
thank the witness for the testimony
 
02:19:29.509 --> 02:19:29.519 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:32.389 --> 02:19:32.399 align:start position:0%
i see no other hands
 
02:19:36.469 --> 02:19:36.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:38.389 --> 02:19:38.399 align:start position:0%

02:19:55.670 --> 02:19:55.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:57.429 --> 02:19:57.439 align:start position:0%
yup can you hear me
 
02:19:57.439 --> 02:20:01.030 align:start position:0%
yup can you hear me
sir

02:20:01.030 --> 02:20:01.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:03.910 --> 02:20:03.920 align:start position:0%
hello yes uh chief posey please please
 
02:20:07.190 --> 02:20:07.200 align:start position:0%
state your name for the right
 
02:20:08.790 --> 02:20:08.800 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman members of the
 
02:20:10.230 --> 02:20:10.240 align:start position:0%
committee for the record my name is
 
02:20:12.389 --> 02:20:12.399 align:start position:0%
david goldstein i'm the chief of police
 
02:20:14.230 --> 02:20:14.240 align:start position:0%
for the city of franklin and i represent
 
02:20:16.469 --> 02:20:16.479 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire association of chiefs
 
02:20:17.990 --> 02:20:18.000 align:start position:0%
of police
 
02:20:19.670 --> 02:20:19.680 align:start position:0%
and i'll be very brief in my comments
 
02:20:21.270 --> 02:20:21.280 align:start position:0%
because i think a lot of questions that
 
02:20:23.429 --> 02:20:23.439 align:start position:0%
have been asked might more easily be
 
02:20:24.710 --> 02:20:24.720 align:start position:0%
answered uh
 
02:20:26.870 --> 02:20:26.880 align:start position:0%
with my uh presentation
 
02:20:28.790 --> 02:20:28.800 align:start position:0%
uh i've been a police officer for 41
 
02:20:28.800 --> 02:20:30.630 align:start position:0%
uh i've been a police officer for 41
years

02:20:30.630 --> 02:20:30.640 align:start position:0%
years
 
02:20:32.150 --> 02:20:32.160 align:start position:0%
and i have affected i don't know how
 
02:20:34.230 --> 02:20:34.240 align:start position:0%
many arrests i've affected in that time
 
02:20:34.240 --> 02:20:35.349 align:start position:0%
many arrests i've affected in that time
period

02:20:35.349 --> 02:20:35.359 align:start position:0%
period
 
02:20:37.110 --> 02:20:37.120 align:start position:0%
i will tell the committee i will share
 
02:20:39.510 --> 02:20:39.520 align:start position:0%
with the committee that i've arrested
 
02:20:40.550 --> 02:20:40.560 align:start position:0%
people from
 
02:20:43.429 --> 02:20:43.439 align:start position:0%
anything from a very simple
 
02:20:45.510 --> 02:20:45.520 align:start position:0%
violations up to an and the necessity of
 
02:20:48.389 --> 02:20:48.399 align:start position:0%
using um lethal force in in conducting
 
02:20:49.670 --> 02:20:49.680 align:start position:0%
an arrest
 
02:20:49.680 --> 02:20:50.469 align:start position:0%
an arrest
so

02:20:50.469 --> 02:20:50.479 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:20:52.230 --> 02:20:52.240 align:start position:0%
i can go on from there
 
02:20:55.510 --> 02:20:55.520 align:start position:0%
we oppose hb66 in part specifically the
 
02:20:57.030 --> 02:20:57.040 align:start position:0%
part that removes
 
02:20:59.030 --> 02:20:59.040 align:start position:0%
affect an arrest or
 
02:21:00.790 --> 02:21:00.800 align:start position:0%
and the reason for that is quite simply
 
02:21:02.630 --> 02:21:02.640 align:start position:0%
this is just one of the tools in our
 
02:21:05.270 --> 02:21:05.280 align:start position:0%
toolbox in order to be able to do our
 
02:21:09.030 --> 02:21:09.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:10.870 --> 02:21:10.880 align:start position:0%
we are under great deal of scrutiny
 
02:21:13.429 --> 02:21:13.439 align:start position:0%
today we always have been
 
02:21:15.349 --> 02:21:15.359 align:start position:0%
new hampshire did adopt the tennessee v
 
02:21:18.710 --> 02:21:18.720 align:start position:0%
garner standard back in the 80s prior to
 
02:21:21.429 --> 02:21:21.439 align:start position:0%
that like most states in the country we
 
02:21:23.110 --> 02:21:23.120 align:start position:0%
did not have it and we were able to
 
02:21:25.190 --> 02:21:25.200 align:start position:0%
shoot fleeing felons just because they
 
02:21:26.950 --> 02:21:26.960 align:start position:0%
were fleeing felons whether they were
 
02:21:28.950 --> 02:21:28.960 align:start position:0%
armed or not and i would refer you to a
 
02:21:31.270 --> 02:21:31.280 align:start position:0%
dover case that occurred just before the
 
02:21:34.469 --> 02:21:34.479 align:start position:0%
tennessee v gardner uh decision
 
02:21:36.710 --> 02:21:36.720 align:start position:0%
the use of lethal force and affecting
 
02:21:38.550 --> 02:21:38.560 align:start position:0%
any arrest for us
 
02:21:40.870 --> 02:21:40.880 align:start position:0%
is and always has been an option of last
 
02:21:40.880 --> 02:21:41.990 align:start position:0%
is and always has been an option of last
resort

02:21:41.990 --> 02:21:42.000 align:start position:0%
resort
 
02:21:44.070 --> 02:21:44.080 align:start position:0%
we don't look forward and i got the
 
02:21:46.710 --> 02:21:46.720 align:start position:0%
impression from one of the uh presenters
 
02:21:48.710 --> 02:21:48.720 align:start position:0%
we do not look forward to every day to
 
02:21:50.790 --> 02:21:50.800 align:start position:0%
going out and shooting somebody just
 
02:21:52.550 --> 02:21:52.560 align:start position:0%
because they don't submit to an arrest
 
02:21:54.309 --> 02:21:54.319 align:start position:0%
when we tell them that that that in fact
 
02:21:55.670 --> 02:21:55.680 align:start position:0%
is the case
 
02:21:55.680 --> 02:21:56.870 align:start position:0%
is the case
um

02:21:56.870 --> 02:21:56.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:21:59.990 --> 02:22:00.000 align:start position:0%
this uh removal or keeping this in uh
 
02:22:02.230 --> 02:22:02.240 align:start position:0%
rsa 627.5
 
02:22:05.110 --> 02:22:05.120 align:start position:0%
is can does not give us carte blanche to
 
02:22:06.870 --> 02:22:06.880 align:start position:0%
use any level of force that we're
 
02:22:08.389 --> 02:22:08.399 align:start position:0%
talking about here
 
02:22:10.389 --> 02:22:10.399 align:start position:0%
and quite frankly i think we're getting
 
02:22:11.910 --> 02:22:11.920 align:start position:0%
lost in a little bit of the semantic
 
02:22:14.309 --> 02:22:14.319 align:start position:0%
issue here everybody's talking about
 
02:22:14.319 --> 02:22:15.429 align:start position:0%
issue here everybody's talking about
shooting

02:22:15.429 --> 02:22:15.439 align:start position:0%
shooting
 
02:22:17.030 --> 02:22:17.040 align:start position:0%
the statute
 
02:22:19.270 --> 02:22:19.280 align:start position:0%
addresses lethal force
 
02:22:21.510 --> 02:22:21.520 align:start position:0%
there are other forms of lethal force
 
02:22:22.950 --> 02:22:22.960 align:start position:0%
and i think we should acknowledge that
 
02:22:24.550 --> 02:22:24.560 align:start position:0%
as well
 
02:22:26.309 --> 02:22:26.319 align:start position:0%
all too often by the way we find
 
02:22:27.910 --> 02:22:27.920 align:start position:0%
ourselves that being law enforcement
 
02:22:29.910 --> 02:22:29.920 align:start position:0%
officers in rapidly developing
 
02:22:32.150 --> 02:22:32.160 align:start position:0%
situations and again another presenter
 
02:22:34.309 --> 02:22:34.319 align:start position:0%
seemed to think that that was not a
 
02:22:37.429 --> 02:22:37.439 align:start position:0%
viable consideration well quite frankly
 
02:22:39.670 --> 02:22:39.680 align:start position:0%
i would invite any member of the public
 
02:22:42.150 --> 02:22:42.160 align:start position:0%
or any member of the committee to come
 
02:22:44.230 --> 02:22:44.240 align:start position:0%
and train with us on how quickly we have
 
02:22:46.389 --> 02:22:46.399 align:start position:0%
to make decisions at times that do in
 
02:22:49.110 --> 02:22:49.120 align:start position:0%
fact result in the use of lethal force
 
02:22:52.070 --> 02:22:52.080 align:start position:0%
and to my knowledge in my 41 year career
 
02:22:54.469 --> 02:22:54.479 align:start position:0%
i am not aware of any police officer
 
02:22:56.710 --> 02:22:56.720 align:start position:0%
that the attorney general has said was
 
02:22:58.550 --> 02:22:58.560 align:start position:0%
engaged in a
 
02:23:02.469 --> 02:23:02.479 align:start position:0%
in an actionable use of deadly force
 
02:23:04.230 --> 02:23:04.240 align:start position:0%
therefore i would ask the committee and
 
02:23:06.230 --> 02:23:06.240 align:start position:0%
we would ask the committee to find h.b
 
02:23:06.240 --> 02:23:07.590 align:start position:0%
we would ask the committee to find h.b
66

02:23:07.590 --> 02:23:07.600 align:start position:0%
66
 
02:23:10.389 --> 02:23:10.399 align:start position:0%
in expedient to legislate
 
02:23:12.150 --> 02:23:12.160 align:start position:0%
and i would also again remind the
 
02:23:14.070 --> 02:23:14.080 align:start position:0%
committee that we are accountable
 
02:23:15.830 --> 02:23:15.840 align:start position:0%
whenever we do use deadly force we're
 
02:23:17.910 --> 02:23:17.920 align:start position:0%
accountable to our departments we are
 
02:23:20.070 --> 02:23:20.080 align:start position:0%
accountable to the attorney general who
 
02:23:22.230 --> 02:23:22.240 align:start position:0%
investigates this and in my career as a
 
02:23:23.830 --> 02:23:23.840 align:start position:0%
state trooper and as a member of the
 
02:23:26.309 --> 02:23:26.319 align:start position:0%
major crime unit i investigated a large
 
02:23:27.990 --> 02:23:28.000 align:start position:0%
number of officer-involved shootings and
 
02:23:29.990 --> 02:23:30.000 align:start position:0%
to date have not seen one that wasn't
 
02:23:32.070 --> 02:23:32.080 align:start position:0%
valid i'm more than happy to answer
 
02:23:37.270 --> 02:23:37.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:38.150 --> 02:23:38.160 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony
 
02:23:41.030 --> 02:23:41.040 align:start position:0%
representative newman
 
02:23:43.349 --> 02:23:43.359 align:start position:0%
yes uh thank you mr chairman and thank
 
02:23:47.110 --> 02:23:47.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:48.870 --> 02:23:48.880 align:start position:0%
do you believe that
 
02:23:52.150 --> 02:23:52.160 align:start position:0%
well the sponsor stated that the nash
 
02:23:53.429 --> 02:23:53.439 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire law was
 
02:23:53.439 --> 02:23:55.590 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire law was
unconstitutional

02:23:55.590 --> 02:23:55.600 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional
 
02:23:57.670 --> 02:23:57.680 align:start position:0%
and you just stated that there were
 
02:24:00.150 --> 02:24:00.160 align:start position:0%
intervening cases that happen between
 
02:24:02.389 --> 02:24:02.399 align:start position:0%
that case and now
 
02:24:04.710 --> 02:24:04.720 align:start position:0%
do you believe that the result of those
 
02:24:07.030 --> 02:24:07.040 align:start position:0%
intervening cases
 
02:24:10.230 --> 02:24:10.240 align:start position:0%
removed the unconstitutional aspect of
 
02:24:13.110 --> 02:24:13.120 align:start position:0%
the previous law
 
02:24:16.630 --> 02:24:16.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:16.640 --> 02:24:19.510 align:start position:0%
 
yes

02:24:19.510 --> 02:24:19.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:20.630 --> 02:24:20.640 align:start position:0%
if that answers your question
 
02:24:20.640 --> 02:24:27.510 align:start position:0%
if that answers your question
representative

02:24:27.510 --> 02:24:27.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:38.870 --> 02:24:38.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:40.389 --> 02:24:40.399 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony
 
02:24:42.309 --> 02:24:42.319 align:start position:0%
chief goldstein i do have one question
 
02:24:44.870 --> 02:24:44.880 align:start position:0%
do you recall
 
02:24:48.309 --> 02:24:48.319 align:start position:0%
roughly in the last let's say two years
 
02:24:49.910 --> 02:24:49.920 align:start position:0%
how often
 
02:24:52.150 --> 02:24:52.160 align:start position:0%
was deadly force used when affecting
 
02:24:55.270 --> 02:24:55.280 align:start position:0%
interest in the state of new hampshire
 
02:24:56.870 --> 02:24:56.880 align:start position:0%
i don't have that exact number mr
 
02:24:59.750 --> 02:24:59.760 align:start position:0%
chairman or representative but um
 
02:25:01.030 --> 02:25:01.040 align:start position:0%
certainly we can find that out that's
 
02:25:03.830 --> 02:25:03.840 align:start position:0%
all public information but i i think i
 
02:25:06.710 --> 02:25:06.720 align:start position:0%
could once again underscore uh my belief
 
02:25:08.469 --> 02:25:08.479 align:start position:0%
in my uh
 
02:25:11.270 --> 02:25:11.280 align:start position:0%
that um none of those have resulted in
 
02:25:12.710 --> 02:25:12.720 align:start position:0%
anything actionable by the attorney
 
02:25:14.469 --> 02:25:14.479 align:start position:0%
general in other words that every time
 
02:25:16.870 --> 02:25:16.880 align:start position:0%
that occurred the officer was vindicated
 
02:25:23.429 --> 02:25:23.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:25.750 --> 02:25:25.760 align:start position:0%
representative rory thank you uh thank
 
02:25:28.790 --> 02:25:28.800 align:start position:0%
you chief for taking my question
 
02:25:32.830 --> 02:25:32.840 align:start position:0%
while the statute as written is perhaps
 
02:25:32.840 --> 02:25:34.389 align:start position:0%
while the statute as written is perhaps
unconstitutional

02:25:34.389 --> 02:25:34.399 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional
 
02:25:36.309 --> 02:25:36.319 align:start position:0%
would you agree though that police since
 
02:25:38.469 --> 02:25:38.479 align:start position:0%
the tennessee case have been trained to
 
02:25:40.950 --> 02:25:40.960 align:start position:0%
the standard set by the tennessee case
 
02:25:42.870 --> 02:25:42.880 align:start position:0%
and that there are other statutes on the
 
02:25:45.110 --> 02:25:45.120 align:start position:0%
books that are also unconstitutional
 
02:25:48.150 --> 02:25:48.160 align:start position:0%
that we no longer enforce
 
02:25:50.230 --> 02:25:50.240 align:start position:0%
absolutely 110
 
02:25:53.349 --> 02:25:53.359 align:start position:0%
i would agree with that uh we we adopted
 
02:25:55.030 --> 02:25:55.040 align:start position:0%
it in new hampshire
 
02:25:57.910 --> 02:25:57.920 align:start position:0%
and we've lived by it and i also train
 
02:25:57.920 --> 02:25:59.190 align:start position:0%
and we've lived by it and i also train
um

02:25:59.190 --> 02:25:59.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:26:01.670 --> 02:26:01.680 align:start position:0%
at the i train recruits at the academy
 
02:26:04.309 --> 02:26:04.319 align:start position:0%
as well as in service uh as a member of
 
02:26:06.070 --> 02:26:06.080 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire state police swat unit
 
02:26:08.230 --> 02:26:08.240 align:start position:0%
for over a dozen years
 
02:26:10.150 --> 02:26:10.160 align:start position:0%
this was something we talked about on on
 
02:26:12.790 --> 02:26:12.800 align:start position:0%
many occasions and quite frankly uh it's
 
02:26:17.790 --> 02:26:17.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:22.710 --> 02:26:22.720 align:start position:0%
thinking roy thank you a quick follow-up
 
02:26:22.720 --> 02:26:23.429 align:start position:0%
thinking roy thank you a quick follow-up
so

02:26:23.429 --> 02:26:23.439 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:26:25.510 --> 02:26:25.520 align:start position:0%
uh what's concerning me a little bit
 
02:26:27.030 --> 02:26:27.040 align:start position:0%
about the way this is written is that
 
02:26:29.830 --> 02:26:29.840 align:start position:0%
the words effectuate and arrest
 
02:26:29.840 --> 02:26:31.270 align:start position:0%
the words effectuate and arrest
um

02:26:31.270 --> 02:26:31.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:26:33.190 --> 02:26:33.200 align:start position:0%
that's a in my understanding much more
 
02:26:35.349 --> 02:26:35.359 align:start position:0%
complex situation than those words was
 
02:26:38.950 --> 02:26:38.960 align:start position:0%
revealed so if the statute said you
 
02:26:41.910 --> 02:26:41.920 align:start position:0%
cannot shoot a fleeing felon
 
02:26:43.830 --> 02:26:43.840 align:start position:0%
simply because you have a warrant that
 
02:26:45.750 --> 02:26:45.760 align:start position:0%
makes him a felon it would be much
 
02:26:47.590 --> 02:26:47.600 align:start position:0%
clearer than saying you cannot
 
02:26:49.270 --> 02:26:49.280 align:start position:0%
shoot someone while effectuating your
 
02:26:50.790 --> 02:26:50.800 align:start position:0%
arrest because on the use of forced
 
02:26:53.910 --> 02:26:53.920 align:start position:0%
continuum it can start at verbal and go
 
02:26:55.590 --> 02:26:55.600 align:start position:0%
all the way to leave the force in
 
02:26:55.600 --> 02:26:56.710 align:start position:0%
all the way to leave the force in
seconds

02:26:56.710 --> 02:26:56.720 align:start position:0%
seconds
 
02:26:58.790 --> 02:26:58.800 align:start position:0%
and in during that you would be trying
 
02:27:00.870 --> 02:27:00.880 align:start position:0%
to effectuate an arrest so would that
 
02:27:02.230 --> 02:27:02.240 align:start position:0%
knock with the officer in a horrible
 
02:27:03.910 --> 02:27:03.920 align:start position:0%
position trying to decide what you know
 
02:27:06.870 --> 02:27:06.880 align:start position:0%
which way that was going
 
02:27:08.710 --> 02:27:08.720 align:start position:0%
well first and foremost uh it's not a
 
02:27:10.550 --> 02:27:10.560 align:start position:0%
continuum anymore
 
02:27:13.510 --> 02:27:13.520 align:start position:0%
it's more of a cyclical uh type of um
 
02:27:13.520 --> 02:27:14.550 align:start position:0%
it's more of a cyclical uh type of um
activity

02:27:14.550 --> 02:27:14.560 align:start position:0%
activity
 
02:27:16.389 --> 02:27:16.399 align:start position:0%
we don't go from one end of a continuum
 
02:27:18.389 --> 02:27:18.399 align:start position:0%
where there's perhaps nothing more than
 
02:27:20.309 --> 02:27:20.319 align:start position:0%
verbal commands all the way and then
 
02:27:22.230 --> 02:27:22.240 align:start position:0%
follow that continuum of that line to
 
02:27:24.870 --> 02:27:24.880 align:start position:0%
the use of deadly force uh in my
 
02:27:26.870 --> 02:27:26.880 align:start position:0%
situation for example
 
02:27:30.070 --> 02:27:30.080 align:start position:0%
um i was trying very simply to affect an
 
02:27:32.309 --> 02:27:32.319 align:start position:0%
arrest in a domestic and the next thing
 
02:27:34.790 --> 02:27:34.800 align:start position:0%
i know is uh i had to use lethal force
 
02:27:36.630 --> 02:27:36.640 align:start position:0%
in order to save my own life
 
02:27:39.110 --> 02:27:39.120 align:start position:0%
uh that happened with literally within
 
02:27:39.120 --> 02:27:40.070 align:start position:0%
uh that happened with literally within
seconds

02:27:40.070 --> 02:27:40.080 align:start position:0%
seconds
 
02:27:41.670 --> 02:27:41.680 align:start position:0%
um so
 
02:27:43.270 --> 02:27:43.280 align:start position:0%
i would disagree with that
 
02:27:45.270 --> 02:27:45.280 align:start position:0%
characterization however if i understand
 
02:27:47.830 --> 02:27:47.840 align:start position:0%
what you're asking correctly yeah it's a
 
02:27:50.630 --> 02:27:50.640 align:start position:0%
very difficult decision making process
 
02:27:52.950 --> 02:27:52.960 align:start position:0%
it's a very complex process and as i
 
02:27:55.510 --> 02:27:55.520 align:start position:0%
alluded to earlier it happens very very
 
02:27:59.190 --> 02:27:59.200 align:start position:0%
rapidly in all too many situations so um
 
02:28:01.510 --> 02:28:01.520 align:start position:0%
if you wish to try to regulate a police
 
02:28:03.830 --> 02:28:03.840 align:start position:0%
officer's behavior by taking out that
 
02:28:05.750 --> 02:28:05.760 align:start position:0%
phrase which helps us
 
02:28:08.710 --> 02:28:08.720 align:start position:0%
um by taking out that phrase it actually
 
02:28:10.950 --> 02:28:10.960 align:start position:0%
may have just the opposite effect of
 
02:28:12.790 --> 02:28:12.800 align:start position:0%
putting people in an even more dire
 
02:28:12.800 --> 02:28:14.070 align:start position:0%
putting people in an even more dire
situation

02:28:14.070 --> 02:28:14.080 align:start position:0%
situation
 
02:28:26.469 --> 02:28:26.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:27.990 --> 02:28:28.000 align:start position:0%
seeing no further questions i want to
 
02:28:30.790 --> 02:28:30.800 align:start position:0%
thank thank you chief for your testimony
 
02:28:42.550 --> 02:28:42.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:45.670 --> 02:28:45.680 align:start position:0%
the next witness is joseph ever
 
02:28:47.190 --> 02:28:47.200 align:start position:0%
you please just like identify yourself
 
02:28:48.870 --> 02:28:48.880 align:start position:0%
the record state where you were where
 
02:28:51.510 --> 02:28:51.520 align:start position:0%
you are from and please state whether
 
02:28:54.150 --> 02:28:54.160 align:start position:0%
you are in support or opposition of h.p
 
02:28:54.160 --> 02:28:55.990 align:start position:0%
you are in support or opposition of h.p
66

02:28:55.990 --> 02:28:56.000 align:start position:0%
66
 
02:28:57.830 --> 02:28:57.840 align:start position:0%
good afternoon everyone
 
02:28:59.670 --> 02:28:59.680 align:start position:0%
thank you for the opportunity to talk to
 
02:29:01.590 --> 02:29:01.600 align:start position:0%
you this morning or this afternoon's
 
02:29:04.309 --> 02:29:04.319 align:start position:0%
case may be my name is joe ebert it's
 
02:29:04.319 --> 02:29:06.070 align:start position:0%
case may be my name is joe ebert it's
e-b-e-r-t

02:29:06.070 --> 02:29:06.080 align:start position:0%
e-b-e-r-t
 
02:29:07.270 --> 02:29:07.280 align:start position:0%
i'm a captain with the new hampshire
 
02:29:08.389 --> 02:29:08.399 align:start position:0%
state police
 
02:29:10.150 --> 02:29:10.160 align:start position:0%
uh and i'm representing the state police
 
02:29:12.630 --> 02:29:12.640 align:start position:0%
today uh we are not taking an official
 
02:29:15.030 --> 02:29:15.040 align:start position:0%
stance on this bill however
 
02:29:18.070 --> 02:29:18.080 align:start position:0%
um and i'll do my best not to uh rehash
 
02:29:19.670 --> 02:29:19.680 align:start position:0%
things that have uh already been brought
 
02:29:20.550 --> 02:29:20.560 align:start position:0%
up but i
 
02:29:23.349 --> 02:29:23.359 align:start position:0%
i did want to uh at least address that
 
02:29:25.750 --> 02:29:25.760 align:start position:0%
uh the tennessee verse gardner
 
02:29:27.670 --> 02:29:27.680 align:start position:0%
decision he
 
02:29:30.389 --> 02:29:30.399 align:start position:0%
talked about a non-dangerous non-armed
 
02:29:32.309 --> 02:29:32.319 align:start position:0%
individual and i don't think that that's
 
02:29:34.230 --> 02:29:34.240 align:start position:0%
what our uh the seizure of that
 
02:29:35.429 --> 02:29:35.439 align:start position:0%
individual and i don't think that that's
 
02:29:38.230 --> 02:29:38.240 align:start position:0%
what our statute uh refers to our
 
02:29:40.309 --> 02:29:40.319 align:start position:0%
statute uh is talking very very
 
02:29:40.319 --> 02:29:41.590 align:start position:0%
statute uh is talking very very
specifically

02:29:41.590 --> 02:29:41.600 align:start position:0%
specifically
 
02:29:41.600 --> 02:29:42.309 align:start position:0%
specifically
to

02:29:42.309 --> 02:29:42.319 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:29:42.319 --> 02:29:43.190 align:start position:0%
to
uh

02:29:43.190 --> 02:29:43.200 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:29:45.429 --> 02:29:45.439 align:start position:0%
a very narrow time when you could use
 
02:29:47.270 --> 02:29:47.280 align:start position:0%
deadly force
 
02:29:49.429 --> 02:29:49.439 align:start position:0%
to prevent the escape from custody of a
 
02:29:49.439 --> 02:29:50.710 align:start position:0%
to prevent the escape from custody of a
person

02:29:50.710 --> 02:29:50.720 align:start position:0%
person
 
02:29:53.270 --> 02:29:53.280 align:start position:0%
so in that tennessee v gardner the
 
02:29:55.990 --> 02:29:56.000 align:start position:0%
decision specifically talks about uh
 
02:29:58.389 --> 02:29:58.399 align:start position:0%
this the seizure of this individual and
 
02:29:59.910 --> 02:29:59.920 align:start position:0%
i think that's that's key for me this
 
02:30:01.670 --> 02:30:01.680 align:start position:0%
may be a semantics thing
 
02:30:03.030 --> 02:30:03.040 align:start position:0%
uh but
 
02:30:05.190 --> 02:30:05.200 align:start position:0%
if you're able to prevent the escape
 
02:30:07.270 --> 02:30:07.280 align:start position:0%
from custody of an uh
 
02:30:09.510 --> 02:30:09.520 align:start position:0%
of an individual for specific reasons
 
02:30:11.830 --> 02:30:11.840 align:start position:0%
within our statute
 
02:30:14.230 --> 02:30:14.240 align:start position:0%
uh and you're able to do that by using
 
02:30:15.990 --> 02:30:16.000 align:start position:0%
deadly force
 
02:30:17.750 --> 02:30:17.760 align:start position:0%
my training has always been that that
 
02:30:19.270 --> 02:30:19.280 align:start position:0%
then you're affecting an arrest you're
 
02:30:21.670 --> 02:30:21.680 align:start position:0%
affecting a seizure of that individual
 
02:30:24.870 --> 02:30:24.880 align:start position:0%
so it it's hard for me to uh reconcile
 
02:30:24.880 --> 02:30:25.830 align:start position:0%
so it it's hard for me to uh reconcile
that

02:30:25.830 --> 02:30:25.840 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:30:28.550 --> 02:30:28.560 align:start position:0%
i think that by taking out uh effect and
 
02:30:31.429 --> 02:30:31.439 align:start position:0%
arrest you're causing um
 
02:30:33.830 --> 02:30:33.840 align:start position:0%
uh you know disagreement within the the
 
02:30:36.630 --> 02:30:36.640 align:start position:0%
statute itself uh because by the very
 
02:30:38.469 --> 02:30:38.479 align:start position:0%
nature of preventing the escape leaving
 
02:30:40.710 --> 02:30:40.720 align:start position:0%
that portion in by the use of deadly
 
02:30:42.630 --> 02:30:42.640 align:start position:0%
force you're in effect you're affecting
 
02:30:46.389 --> 02:30:46.399 align:start position:0%
an arrest so i i hope that
 
02:30:48.790 --> 02:30:48.800 align:start position:0%
comes across as simple as i
 
02:30:50.790 --> 02:30:50.800 align:start position:0%
had intended it to be but i am
 
02:30:52.469 --> 02:30:52.479 align:start position:0%
absolutely willing to take any questions
 
02:31:00.070 --> 02:31:00.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:02.070 --> 02:31:02.080 align:start position:0%
seeing no hands raised i wanna
 
02:31:03.990 --> 02:31:04.000 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony
 
02:31:20.630 --> 02:31:20.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:23.270 --> 02:31:23.280 align:start position:0%
i do see the hands raised in the
 
02:31:24.710 --> 02:31:24.720 align:start position:0%
members of republican representative
 
02:31:27.590 --> 02:31:27.600 align:start position:0%
abramson we uh
 
02:31:29.030 --> 02:31:29.040 align:start position:0%
we're not going to allow members of the
 
02:31:31.030 --> 02:31:31.040 align:start position:0%
public or representatives
 
02:31:33.270 --> 02:31:33.280 align:start position:0%
to testify more than once on during the
 
02:31:35.750 --> 02:31:35.760 align:start position:0%
public hearing so we were going to
 
02:31:37.750 --> 02:31:37.760 align:start position:0%
if there's anyone who hasn't testified
 
02:31:39.429 --> 02:31:39.439 align:start position:0%
already wishes to testify they may step
 
02:31:39.439 --> 02:31:44.710 align:start position:0%
already wishes to testify they may step
forward

02:31:44.710 --> 02:31:44.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:46.790 --> 02:31:46.800 align:start position:0%
seeing no hands raised we will close the
 
02:32:04.469 --> 02:32:04.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:04.479 --> 02:32:19.110 align:start position:0%
 
future

02:32:19.110 --> 02:32:19.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:21.590 --> 02:32:21.600 align:start position:0%
a quick reminder we do have people who
 
02:32:23.990 --> 02:32:24.000 align:start position:0%
signed in uh in support in opposition to
 
02:32:25.590 --> 02:32:25.600 align:start position:0%
this bill and i will
 
02:32:27.190 --> 02:32:27.200 align:start position:0%
uh read those totals if you would like
 
02:32:29.750 --> 02:32:29.760 align:start position:0%

assignment to you if you don't mind you
 
02:32:40.550 --> 02:32:40.560 align:start position:0%

for
 
02:33:10.950 --> 02:33:10.960 align:start position:0%
hb 564 which is prohibiting the use of
 
02:33:12.550 --> 02:33:12.560 align:start position:0%
rubber bullets and tear gas by law
 
02:33:12.560 --> 02:33:13.910 align:start position:0%
rubber bullets and tear gas by law
enforcement

02:33:13.910 --> 02:33:13.920 align:start position:0%
enforcement
 
02:33:15.190 --> 02:33:15.200 align:start position:0%
it's like we're opening up a public
 
02:33:15.200 --> 02:33:16.469 align:start position:0%
it's like we're opening up a public
hearing

02:33:16.469 --> 02:33:16.479 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
02:33:19.270 --> 02:33:19.280 align:start position:0%
at 11 35
 
02:33:19.280 --> 02:33:20.389 align:start position:0%
at 11 35
am

02:33:20.389 --> 02:33:20.399 align:start position:0%
am
 
02:33:37.510 --> 02:33:37.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:37.520 --> 02:33:48.870 align:start position:0%
 
so

02:33:48.870 --> 02:33:48.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:48.880 --> 02:34:38.389 align:start position:0%
 
uh

02:34:38.389 --> 02:34:38.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:41.110 --> 02:34:41.120 align:start position:0%
for the purposes of this public hearing
 
02:34:42.389 --> 02:34:42.399 align:start position:0%
due to time constraints we are going to
 
02:34:44.790 --> 02:34:44.800 align:start position:0%
limit testimony to two minutes per
 
02:34:47.510 --> 02:34:47.520 align:start position:0%
witness uh i will sit for the sponsor
 
02:34:48.870 --> 02:34:48.880 align:start position:0%
sponsor introducing the bill we will
 
02:34:50.790 --> 02:34:50.800 align:start position:0%
allow a performance
 
02:34:52.710 --> 02:34:52.720 align:start position:0%
all right no worries i'll be but i
 
02:34:55.990 --> 02:34:56.000 align:start position:0%
appreciate that mr chair um
 
02:34:57.830 --> 02:34:57.840 align:start position:0%
colleagues hi my name is representative
 
02:34:59.990 --> 02:35:00.000 align:start position:0%
manuel specia and i'm here
 
02:35:03.910 --> 02:35:03.920 align:start position:0%
before you discuss the hp 564. um and
 
02:35:06.469 --> 02:35:06.479 align:start position:0%
before i have an amendment two mile that
 
02:35:08.150 --> 02:35:08.160 align:start position:0%
should have been shared with everyone in
 
02:35:10.309 --> 02:35:10.319 align:start position:0%
this amendment will narrow the scope of
 
02:35:13.750 --> 02:35:13.760 align:start position:0%
bill to restrict the use of republican
 
02:35:15.429 --> 02:35:15.439 align:start position:0%
tear gas
 
02:35:17.670 --> 02:35:17.680 align:start position:0%
rather than prohibiting their use entire
 
02:35:19.670 --> 02:35:19.680 align:start position:0%
the proposed amendment would prohibit
 
02:35:22.230 --> 02:35:22.240 align:start position:0%
the use of these weapons in situations
 
02:35:23.349 --> 02:35:23.359 align:start position:0%
where there is
 
02:35:25.990 --> 02:35:26.000 align:start position:0%
not an imminent risk of bodily harm to
 
02:35:27.270 --> 02:35:27.280 align:start position:0%
the officer
 
02:35:28.950 --> 02:35:28.960 align:start position:0%
the goal is to balance the power and
 
02:35:32.230 --> 02:35:32.240 align:start position:0%
responsibility of law enforcement
 
02:35:33.750 --> 02:35:33.760 align:start position:0%
to protest
 
02:35:36.070 --> 02:35:36.080 align:start position:0%
public safety with you know
 
02:35:38.230 --> 02:35:38.240 align:start position:0%
to protect sorry public safety with the
 
02:35:40.070 --> 02:35:40.080 align:start position:0%
threat of these weapons to the physical
 
02:35:42.469 --> 02:35:42.479 align:start position:0%
well-being of individuals particularly
 
02:35:44.469 --> 02:35:44.479 align:start position:0%
unarmed individuals
 
02:35:46.230 --> 02:35:46.240 align:start position:0%
and you know this bill is in response to
 
02:35:48.070 --> 02:35:48.080 align:start position:0%
the number of injuries and trauma that
 
02:35:49.910 --> 02:35:49.920 align:start position:0%
have been caused over the last few years
 
02:35:51.670 --> 02:35:51.680 align:start position:0%
during peaceful demonstrations you know
 
02:35:54.710 --> 02:35:54.720 align:start position:0%
injuries such as broken bones skin burns
 
02:35:55.590 --> 02:35:55.600 align:start position:0%
and then
 
02:35:57.270 --> 02:35:57.280 align:start position:0%
internal injuries have see have been
 
02:36:00.309 --> 02:36:00.319 align:start position:0%
seen due to tear gas and herbal bullets
 
02:36:02.230 --> 02:36:02.240 align:start position:0%
we have seen how tear gas has caused
 
02:36:04.950 --> 02:36:04.960 align:start position:0%
people to be suffocated and tear gas is
 
02:36:07.349 --> 02:36:07.359 align:start position:0%
intended to be deployed at a distance
 
02:36:09.750 --> 02:36:09.760 align:start position:0%
and when canisters are launched directly
 
02:36:12.070 --> 02:36:12.080 align:start position:0%
at crowds they're prone to causing
 
02:36:15.110 --> 02:36:15.120 align:start position:0%
serious eye head brain or chest injuries
 
02:36:17.349 --> 02:36:17.359 align:start position:0%
from the force of impact as well as
 
02:36:18.790 --> 02:36:18.800 align:start position:0%
chemical burns
 
02:36:20.790 --> 02:36:20.800 align:start position:0%
and i understand that the work that our
 
02:36:23.270 --> 02:36:23.280 align:start position:0%
law enforcements must do i you know it's
 
02:36:25.510 --> 02:36:25.520 align:start position:0%
it's it's hard work but we must find
 
02:36:27.990 --> 02:36:28.000 align:start position:0%
alternatives to chemical irritants and
 
02:36:29.830 --> 02:36:29.840 align:start position:0%
rubber bullets police know how to
 
02:36:32.070 --> 02:36:32.080 align:start position:0%
control uh safely control crowds without
 
02:36:33.590 --> 02:36:33.600 align:start position:0%
resorting to these dangerous and
 
02:36:36.469 --> 02:36:36.479 align:start position:0%
potentially lethal weapons and while we
 
02:36:38.790 --> 02:36:38.800 align:start position:0%
have not seen these weapons abused in
 
02:36:41.110 --> 02:36:41.120 align:start position:0%
new hampshire my constituents have seen
 
02:36:43.670 --> 02:36:43.680 align:start position:0%
a number of videos in recent years of
 
02:36:46.070 --> 02:36:46.080 align:start position:0%
unarmed protesters being targeted and
 
02:36:48.070 --> 02:36:48.080 align:start position:0%
seriously injured by rubber bullets in
 
02:36:50.309 --> 02:36:50.319 align:start position:0%
tear gas in other states and these
 
02:36:52.710 --> 02:36:52.720 align:start position:0%
videos are traumatizing and have led to
 
02:36:54.550 --> 02:36:54.560 align:start position:0%
concerns about the use of these weapons
 
02:36:56.630 --> 02:36:56.640 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire and you know this is
 
02:36:58.870 --> 02:36:58.880 align:start position:0%
legislation that is meant uh to ensure
 
02:37:00.710 --> 02:37:00.720 align:start position:0%
that police violence seen elsewhere
 
02:37:02.070 --> 02:37:02.080 align:start position:0%
doesn't happen here
 
02:37:04.630 --> 02:37:04.640 align:start position:0%
um so with that um like i said there is
 
02:37:07.030 --> 02:37:07.040 align:start position:0%
an amendment um so i hope you all would
 
02:37:10.150 --> 02:37:10.160 align:start position:0%
take a look at that um and i will open
 
02:37:21.270 --> 02:37:21.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:24.389 --> 02:37:24.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:24.399 --> 02:37:27.910 align:start position:0%
 
representative

02:37:27.910 --> 02:37:27.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:31.349 --> 02:37:31.359 align:start position:0%
thank you for allowing me a question uh
 
02:37:31.359 --> 02:37:32.870 align:start position:0%
thank you for allowing me a question uh
representative

02:37:32.870 --> 02:37:32.880 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:37:32.880 --> 02:37:33.590 align:start position:0%
representative
so

02:37:33.590 --> 02:37:33.600 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:37:36.630 --> 02:37:36.640 align:start position:0%
you want i'm trying to understand this
 
02:37:36.640 --> 02:37:38.550 align:start position:0%
you want i'm trying to understand this
you're

02:37:38.550 --> 02:37:38.560 align:start position:0%
you're
 
02:37:41.270 --> 02:37:41.280 align:start position:0%
you're asking them not to use
 
02:37:43.990 --> 02:37:44.000 align:start position:0%
rubber bullets or any other non-lethal
 
02:37:45.110 --> 02:37:45.120 align:start position:0%
kind of
 
02:37:47.190 --> 02:37:47.200 align:start position:0%
it was of a
 
02:37:47.200 --> 02:37:48.790 align:start position:0%
it was of a
projectile

02:37:48.790 --> 02:37:48.800 align:start position:0%
projectile
 
02:37:52.150 --> 02:37:52.160 align:start position:0%
so they would be okay to use
 
02:37:55.030 --> 02:37:55.040 align:start position:0%
real projectiles for a gun i mean is
 
02:37:55.910 --> 02:37:55.920 align:start position:0%
that what
 
02:37:57.030 --> 02:37:57.040 align:start position:0%
i guess
 
02:38:00.309 --> 02:38:00.319 align:start position:0%
you're prohibiting a non-lethal and only
 
02:38:05.110 --> 02:38:05.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:07.190 --> 02:38:07.200 align:start position:0%
so no um
 
02:38:09.349 --> 02:38:09.359 align:start position:0%
i'd like to answer um no i think
 
02:38:11.990 --> 02:38:12.000 align:start position:0%
um i would obviously would not want to
 
02:38:14.230 --> 02:38:14.240 align:start position:0%
see lethal weapons to be used in an
 
02:38:16.550 --> 02:38:16.560 align:start position:0%
opposition and like you know as opposed
 
02:38:19.270 --> 02:38:19.280 align:start position:0%
to rubber bullets or tear gas i think
 
02:38:22.230 --> 02:38:22.240 align:start position:0%
um you know i have a lot of faith in our
 
02:38:23.990 --> 02:38:24.000 align:start position:0%
law enforcement to be able to do the
 
02:38:25.990 --> 02:38:26.000 align:start position:0%
right thing and you know be able to
 
02:38:29.750 --> 02:38:29.760 align:start position:0%
control crowds without the use of tear
 
02:38:31.270 --> 02:38:31.280 align:start position:0%
gas but
 
02:38:37.670 --> 02:38:37.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:39.750 --> 02:38:39.760 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:38:43.349 --> 02:38:43.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:45.510 --> 02:38:45.520 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question i'm
 
02:38:48.630 --> 02:38:48.640 align:start position:0%
just curious uh here in new hampshire
 
02:38:52.469 --> 02:38:52.479 align:start position:0%
at uh at protests or gatherings uh that
 
02:38:53.590 --> 02:38:53.600 align:start position:0%
you've either been involved with
 
02:38:55.750 --> 02:38:55.760 align:start position:0%
directly or that you've heard about
 
02:38:58.469 --> 02:38:58.479 align:start position:0%
have you actually seen officers uh
 
02:39:02.710 --> 02:39:02.720 align:start position:0%
equipped with uh with these weapons
 
02:39:05.110 --> 02:39:05.120 align:start position:0%
thanks for the question um i
 
02:39:06.630 --> 02:39:06.640 align:start position:0%
i mean i've seen and here's the thing
 
02:39:09.270 --> 02:39:09.280 align:start position:0%
like i've seen heavy mobilization of
 
02:39:11.590 --> 02:39:11.600 align:start position:0%
um of law enforcement and i think you
 
02:39:13.510 --> 02:39:13.520 align:start position:0%
know that in and of itself is a
 
02:39:16.790 --> 02:39:16.800 align:start position:0%
deterrent um i mean you know i haven't
 
02:39:19.590 --> 02:39:19.600 align:start position:0%
seen the folks with tear gas or rubber
 
02:39:21.830 --> 02:39:21.840 align:start position:0%
bullets like in place but
 
02:39:23.910 --> 02:39:23.920 align:start position:0%
i think you know just because it does
 
02:39:25.510 --> 02:39:25.520 align:start position:0%
like you know the saying just because it
 
02:39:26.950 --> 02:39:26.960 align:start position:0%
doesn't happen here doesn't mean we
 
02:39:28.950 --> 02:39:28.960 align:start position:0%
shouldn't worry about it um i think you
 
02:39:31.750 --> 02:39:31.760 align:start position:0%
know this is just um i feel like we can
 
02:39:34.150 --> 02:39:34.160 align:start position:0%
trust our police officers to comply with
 
02:39:35.990 --> 02:39:36.000 align:start position:0%
with a bill like this so
 
02:39:44.870 --> 02:39:44.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:48.550 --> 02:39:48.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:50.070 --> 02:39:50.080 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you
 
02:39:52.469 --> 02:39:52.479 align:start position:0%
representative take my question
 
02:39:52.479 --> 02:39:53.349 align:start position:0%
representative take my question
um

02:39:53.349 --> 02:39:53.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:39:55.429 --> 02:39:55.439 align:start position:0%
there i think you mentioned the proposed
 
02:39:57.349 --> 02:39:57.359 align:start position:0%
amendment which i'm not sure we have
 
02:39:58.550 --> 02:39:58.560 align:start position:0%
access to
 
02:40:00.469 --> 02:40:00.479 align:start position:0%
and i believe it was to limit it
 
02:40:02.550 --> 02:40:02.560 align:start position:0%
somewhat by saying if they felt they
 
02:40:04.790 --> 02:40:04.800 align:start position:0%
were in danger
 
02:40:07.030 --> 02:40:07.040 align:start position:0%
and physical danger i i guess it would
 
02:40:07.040 --> 02:40:07.990 align:start position:0%
and physical danger i i guess it would
be

02:40:07.990 --> 02:40:08.000 align:start position:0%
be
 
02:40:10.790 --> 02:40:10.800 align:start position:0%
um in in a case like that um would you
 
02:40:10.800 --> 02:40:11.830 align:start position:0%
um in in a case like that um would you
consider

02:40:11.830 --> 02:40:11.840 align:start position:0%
consider
 
02:40:13.750 --> 02:40:13.760 align:start position:0%
like i've seen in some protests people
 
02:40:15.670 --> 02:40:15.680 align:start position:0%
throwing frozen water bottles that
 
02:40:17.429 --> 02:40:17.439 align:start position:0%
police would that be
 
02:40:18.830 --> 02:40:18.840 align:start position:0%
covered by
 
02:40:23.110 --> 02:40:23.120 align:start position:0%
the that's a good question um
 
02:40:24.550 --> 02:40:24.560 align:start position:0%
i mean if i would be up to the
 
02:40:25.990 --> 02:40:26.000 align:start position:0%
discretion of the law enforcement i
 
02:40:26.000 --> 02:40:26.870 align:start position:0%
discretion of the law enforcement i
would

02:40:26.870 --> 02:40:26.880 align:start position:0%
would
 
02:40:28.790 --> 02:40:28.800 align:start position:0%
i mean i i when i talk about this i i
 
02:40:31.190 --> 02:40:31.200 align:start position:0%
mean like real like you know if people
 
02:40:34.870 --> 02:40:34.880 align:start position:0%
showed up with with with rifles or or
 
02:40:37.510 --> 02:40:37.520 align:start position:0%
actual like you know with with pistols
 
02:40:39.110 --> 02:40:39.120 align:start position:0%
and things like that i think then would
 
02:40:40.790 --> 02:40:40.800 align:start position:0%
be a different story
 
02:40:44.070 --> 02:40:44.080 align:start position:0%
um with armed protests um
 
02:40:46.309 --> 02:40:46.319 align:start position:0%
but when it comes to water bottles i
 
02:40:49.190 --> 02:40:49.200 align:start position:0%
don't think that's um i think that's
 
02:40:49.200 --> 02:40:50.710 align:start position:0%
don't think that's um i think that's
different

02:40:50.710 --> 02:40:50.720 align:start position:0%
different
 
02:40:57.670 --> 02:40:57.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:59.750 --> 02:40:59.760 align:start position:0%
representative conley
 
02:41:02.550 --> 02:41:02.560 align:start position:0%
thank you mr jeremy just a comment uh if
 
02:41:03.670 --> 02:41:03.680 align:start position:0%
i may
 
02:41:07.830 --> 02:41:07.840 align:start position:0%
the amendment has been referenced i have
 
02:41:09.429 --> 02:41:09.439 align:start position:0%
stopped this amendment
 
02:41:11.190 --> 02:41:11.200 align:start position:0%
and i intended to have it sent to the
 
02:41:11.200 --> 02:41:12.150 align:start position:0%
and i intended to have it sent to the
committee

02:41:12.150 --> 02:41:12.160 align:start position:0%
committee
 
02:41:15.110 --> 02:41:15.120 align:start position:0%
several hours ago and
 
02:41:16.550 --> 02:41:16.560 align:start position:0%
that does not happen likely it's
 
02:41:18.150 --> 02:41:18.160 align:start position:0%
something that i did not do but i have
 
02:41:20.230 --> 02:41:20.240 align:start position:0%
sent it to everyone on this committee so
 
02:41:22.469 --> 02:41:22.479 align:start position:0%
that they can take a look at it in case
 
02:41:23.910 --> 02:41:23.920 align:start position:0%
the amendment is discussed further
 
02:41:25.670 --> 02:41:25.680 align:start position:0%
that's not right for the delay and
 
02:41:28.469 --> 02:41:28.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:29.349 --> 02:41:29.359 align:start position:0%

02:41:30.550 --> 02:41:30.560 align:start position:0%

case anyone didn't hear
the

02:41:33.110 --> 02:41:33.120 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:41:34.389 --> 02:41:34.399 align:start position:0%

02:44:58.469 --> 02:44:58.479 align:start position:0%
was actually in the queue for hb 66
 
02:45:00.070 --> 02:45:00.080 align:start position:0%
i don't want to speak out of turn but i
 
02:45:00.080 --> 02:45:01.110 align:start position:0%
i don't want to speak out of turn but i
was

02:45:01.110 --> 02:45:01.120 align:start position:0%
was
 
02:45:05.590 --> 02:45:05.600 align:start position:0%
i've been waiting to speak on hb66
 
02:45:07.670 --> 02:45:07.680 align:start position:0%
did we already do that
 
02:45:09.910 --> 02:45:09.920 align:start position:0%
you did sir i had signed up on the thing
 
02:45:11.429 --> 02:45:11.439 align:start position:0%
and i had registered and i was like i
 
02:45:12.950 --> 02:45:12.960 align:start position:0%
said i was standing by in the queue when
 
02:45:15.349 --> 02:45:15.359 align:start position:0%
you guys said ask for any more hands we
 
02:45:16.870 --> 02:45:16.880 align:start position:0%
we clicked here and i think we might
 
02:45:18.630 --> 02:45:18.640 align:start position:0%
have missed it
 
02:45:18.640 --> 02:45:21.030 align:start position:0%
have missed it
so

02:45:21.030 --> 02:45:21.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:22.389 --> 02:45:22.399 align:start position:0%
to the extent that that was the
 
02:45:26.070 --> 02:45:26.080 align:start position:0%
oversight of the chair of this committee
 
02:45:28.870 --> 02:45:28.880 align:start position:0%
it's unfortunately not as simple as uh
 
02:45:30.469 --> 02:45:30.479 align:start position:0%
just simply opening
 
02:45:32.070 --> 02:45:32.080 align:start position:0%
reopening a public hearing that has been
 
02:45:34.870 --> 02:45:34.880 align:start position:0%
closed no i understand that yes sir
 
02:45:37.190 --> 02:45:37.200 align:start position:0%
i may be somewhat limited on my ability
 
02:45:38.790 --> 02:45:38.800 align:start position:0%
to do that
 
02:45:42.550 --> 02:45:42.560 align:start position:0%
so i sincerely apologize for that sounds
 
02:45:44.389 --> 02:45:44.399 align:start position:0%
like that was hard but i would recommend
 
02:45:46.550 --> 02:45:46.560 align:start position:0%
if you'd like to email
 
02:45:48.630 --> 02:45:48.640 align:start position:0%
your written testimony
 
02:45:50.870 --> 02:45:50.880 align:start position:0%
it's something that it could be
 
02:45:52.309 --> 02:45:52.319 align:start position:0%
the committee will have it and will make
 
02:45:53.990 --> 02:45:54.000 align:start position:0%
sure that it's the
 
02:45:55.190 --> 02:45:55.200 align:start position:0%
it's at least
 
02:45:56.950 --> 02:45:56.960 align:start position:0%
referenced you know during the executive
 
02:45:56.960 --> 02:46:01.910 align:start position:0%
referenced you know during the executive
session

02:46:01.910 --> 02:46:01.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:03.269 --> 02:46:03.279 align:start position:0%
yes sir uh
 
02:46:05.269 --> 02:46:05.279 align:start position:0%
yeah i can look into that so would you
 
02:46:06.550 --> 02:46:06.560 align:start position:0%
would you like to direct that email to
 
02:46:10.710 --> 02:46:10.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:11.830 --> 02:46:11.840 align:start position:0%
yes sir
 
02:46:13.510 --> 02:46:13.520 align:start position:0%
uh also with me is lieutenant mark
 
02:46:15.269 --> 02:46:15.279 align:start position:0%
morrison he's the president of the uh
 
02:46:17.910 --> 02:46:17.920 align:start position:0%
new hampshire police association
 
02:46:21.190 --> 02:46:21.200 align:start position:0%
it's sir i was uh also in the queue uh
 
02:46:21.200 --> 02:46:22.150 align:start position:0%
it's sir i was uh also in the queue uh
waiting

02:46:22.150 --> 02:46:22.160 align:start position:0%
waiting
 
02:46:24.150 --> 02:46:24.160 align:start position:0%
for hb66
 
02:46:26.630 --> 02:46:26.640 align:start position:0%
and i was on the line with the
 
02:46:29.349 --> 02:46:29.359 align:start position:0%
technical uh help as as that hearing
 
02:46:31.910 --> 02:46:31.920 align:start position:0%
started to close trying to
 
02:46:33.510 --> 02:46:33.520 align:start position:0%
bring attention to the fact that we were
 
02:46:35.910 --> 02:46:35.920 align:start position:0%
not able to be recognized
 
02:46:38.070 --> 02:46:38.080 align:start position:0%
so i don't know if there are more than
 
02:46:41.030 --> 02:46:41.040 align:start position:0%
just um the two separate
 
02:46:43.030 --> 02:46:43.040 align:start position:0%
entries that had registered this morning
 
02:46:43.040 --> 02:46:43.910 align:start position:0%
entries that had registered this morning
but

02:46:43.910 --> 02:46:43.920 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:46:43.920 --> 02:46:45.670 align:start position:0%
but
um

02:46:45.670 --> 02:46:45.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:46:47.510 --> 02:46:47.520 align:start position:0%
you know so i guess i would ask you know
 
02:46:49.830 --> 02:46:49.840 align:start position:0%
if we could
 
02:46:53.190 --> 02:46:53.200 align:start position:0%
offer that testimony on hb66
 
02:46:55.510 --> 02:46:55.520 align:start position:0%
or reopen the hearing to allow for that
 
02:46:57.429 --> 02:46:57.439 align:start position:0%
due to the technical uh
 
02:46:58.950 --> 02:46:58.960 align:start position:0%
you know issues
 
02:47:01.110 --> 02:47:01.120 align:start position:0%
and sort of just the general situation
 
02:47:03.910 --> 02:47:03.920 align:start position:0%
where we are forced into the zoom
 
02:47:03.920 --> 02:47:04.790 align:start position:0%
where we are forced into the zoom
um

02:47:04.790 --> 02:47:04.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:47:06.550 --> 02:47:06.560 align:start position:0%
in the unfortunate circumstance we're
 
02:47:09.830 --> 02:47:09.840 align:start position:0%
not able to be together in person
 
02:47:11.349 --> 02:47:11.359 align:start position:0%
the best i can
 
02:47:14.389 --> 02:47:14.399 align:start position:0%
say to to both individuals what i can do
 
02:47:14.399 --> 02:47:15.990 align:start position:0%
say to to both individuals what i can do
is

02:47:15.990 --> 02:47:16.000 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:47:17.510 --> 02:47:17.520 align:start position:0%
i would have to consult with the clerk i
 
02:47:19.750 --> 02:47:19.760 align:start position:0%
want the process of doing i i simply
 
02:47:21.510 --> 02:47:21.520 align:start position:0%
just can't reopen the hearing at you
 
02:47:24.070 --> 02:47:24.080 align:start position:0%
know as my own discretion uh his notice
 
02:47:26.070 --> 02:47:26.080 align:start position:0%
requirements that i would have to follow
 
02:47:28.070 --> 02:47:28.080 align:start position:0%
so i i wish it was that easy because
 
02:47:29.590 --> 02:47:29.600 align:start position:0%
it's we're all talking right now it
 
02:47:31.510 --> 02:47:31.520 align:start position:0%
sounds like a simple fix but we're we
 
02:47:33.630 --> 02:47:33.640 align:start position:0%
already opened the public hearing on hb
 
02:47:35.670 --> 02:47:35.680 align:start position:0%
564. so i
 
02:47:36.950 --> 02:47:36.960 align:start position:0%
i can't
 
02:47:36.960 --> 02:47:38.309 align:start position:0%
i can't
um

02:47:38.309 --> 02:47:38.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:47:40.230 --> 02:47:40.240 align:start position:0%
i can't bounce around from each one
 
02:47:42.150 --> 02:47:42.160 align:start position:0%
unfortunately so
 
02:47:43.990 --> 02:47:44.000 align:start position:0%
what i'll do is we're not gonna i will
 
02:47:45.590 --> 02:47:45.600 align:start position:0%
tell you i can say that we're not gonna
 
02:47:48.790 --> 02:47:48.800 align:start position:0%
have an executive session on hb66 and if
 
02:47:50.309 --> 02:47:50.319 align:start position:0%
we do end up doing today it won't be the
 
02:47:51.590 --> 02:47:51.600 align:start position:0%
afternoon i can
 
02:47:51.600 --> 02:47:52.550 align:start position:0%
afternoon i can
recess

02:47:52.550 --> 02:47:52.560 align:start position:0%
recess
 
02:47:53.750 --> 02:47:53.760 align:start position:0%
for lunch
 
02:47:55.510 --> 02:47:55.520 align:start position:0%
what i'll do is i'll
 
02:47:57.910 --> 02:47:57.920 align:start position:0%
ask the clerk the process of
 
02:47:59.349 --> 02:47:59.359 align:start position:0%
whether it's even impossible for us to
 
02:47:59.359 --> 02:48:00.469 align:start position:0%
whether it's even impossible for us to
do

02:48:00.469 --> 02:48:00.479 align:start position:0%
do
 
02:48:00.479 --> 02:48:04.070 align:start position:0%
do
today

02:48:04.070 --> 02:48:04.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:05.990 --> 02:48:06.000 align:start position:0%
very good sir well i appreciate your
 
02:48:08.150 --> 02:48:08.160 align:start position:0%
your time and i apologize for delaying
 
02:48:09.750 --> 02:48:09.760 align:start position:0%
this hearing um
 
02:48:11.750 --> 02:48:11.760 align:start position:0%
as it just sort of carried over into the
 
02:48:13.510 --> 02:48:13.520 align:start position:0%
next hearing we were still logged in
 
02:48:15.750 --> 02:48:15.760 align:start position:0%
from 66 so
 
02:48:17.030 --> 02:48:17.040 align:start position:0%
we will
 
02:48:18.790 --> 02:48:18.800 align:start position:0%
try to look to submit some written
 
02:48:21.269 --> 02:48:21.279 align:start position:0%
testimony in our opposition to that bill
 
02:48:22.309 --> 02:48:22.319 align:start position:0%

02:51:15.349 --> 02:51:15.359 align:start position:0%
i just learned the amendment so my
 
02:51:17.110 --> 02:51:17.120 align:start position:0%
testimony may not directly address the
 
02:51:18.710 --> 02:51:18.720 align:start position:0%
amendment as opposed to the original
 
02:51:21.349 --> 02:51:21.359 align:start position:0%
bill but it may provide some context i'm
 
02:51:24.389 --> 02:51:24.399 align:start position:0%
here to testify in opposition to hb 564
 
02:51:26.469 --> 02:51:26.479 align:start position:0%

and i'm going to assume that by rubber
 
02:51:32.230 --> 02:51:32.240 align:start position:0%
bullets and tear gas the bill is
 
02:51:34.070 --> 02:51:34.080 align:start position:0%
referring to all less lethal impact
 
02:51:36.469 --> 02:51:36.479 align:start position:0%
munitions and chemical munitions such as
 
02:51:37.990 --> 02:51:38.000 align:start position:0%
cs gas
 
02:51:40.389 --> 02:51:40.399 align:start position:0%
rubber bullets as specified are only one
 
02:51:42.469 --> 02:51:42.479 align:start position:0%
type of munition that fall into the
 
02:51:44.309 --> 02:51:44.319 align:start position:0%
category of what we call less lethal
 
02:51:47.030 --> 02:51:47.040 align:start position:0%
impact munitions and by definition these
 
02:51:49.750 --> 02:51:49.760 align:start position:0%
are rubber foam or similar projectiles
 
02:51:52.469 --> 02:51:52.479 align:start position:0%
used to temporarily incapacitate or
 
02:51:54.469 --> 02:51:54.479 align:start position:0%
subdue an armed or otherwise dangerous
 
02:51:54.479 --> 02:51:55.429 align:start position:0%
subdue an armed or otherwise dangerous
person

02:51:55.429 --> 02:51:55.439 align:start position:0%
person
 
02:51:57.429 --> 02:51:57.439 align:start position:0%
the devices are called less lethal
 
02:51:59.030 --> 02:51:59.040 align:start position:0%
because they are designed to create a
 
02:52:01.510 --> 02:52:01.520 align:start position:0%
temporary pain stimulus
 
02:52:03.670 --> 02:52:03.680 align:start position:0%
to bring about a change in behavior
 
02:52:06.070 --> 02:52:06.080 align:start position:0%
tear gas as specified by the bill is a
 
02:52:07.830 --> 02:52:07.840 align:start position:0%
generic term for
 
02:52:10.070 --> 02:52:10.080 align:start position:0%
chemical irritant gases and seems to
 
02:52:13.110 --> 02:52:13.120 align:start position:0%
have become slang for cs gas which is
 
02:52:15.510 --> 02:52:15.520 align:start position:0%
the most commonly type of most commonly
 
02:52:17.830 --> 02:52:17.840 align:start position:0%
used type of tear gas by the police and
 
02:52:19.590 --> 02:52:19.600 align:start position:0%
this is an important distinction because
 
02:52:22.469 --> 02:52:22.479 align:start position:0%
cs gas has been shown to be much safer
 
02:52:24.070 --> 02:52:24.080 align:start position:0%
than the other types of quote-unquote
 
02:52:25.190 --> 02:52:25.200 align:start position:0%
tear gas
 
02:52:28.790 --> 02:52:28.800 align:start position:0%
cs gas causes a temporary irritation to
 
02:52:30.790 --> 02:52:30.800 align:start position:0%
the eyes nose mouth throat and lungs and
 
02:52:33.190 --> 02:52:33.200 align:start position:0%
skin it's used with the hope of creating
 
02:52:35.910 --> 02:52:35.920 align:start position:0%
a strong desire to move out of the
 
02:52:37.990 --> 02:52:38.000 align:start position:0%
contaminated area or make it difficult
 
02:52:40.389 --> 02:52:40.399 align:start position:0%
to mount an offensive attack due to
 
02:52:42.230 --> 02:52:42.240 align:start position:0%
watering of the eyes and difficulty
 
02:52:42.240 --> 02:52:43.190 align:start position:0%
watering of the eyes and difficulty
breathing

02:52:43.190 --> 02:52:43.200 align:start position:0%
breathing
 
02:52:45.190 --> 02:52:45.200 align:start position:0%
the effects of cs gas on an individual
 
02:52:47.429 --> 02:52:47.439 align:start position:0%
immediately begin to dissipate once they
 
02:52:49.269 --> 02:52:49.279 align:start position:0%
are removed from or they remove
 
02:52:52.309 --> 02:52:52.319 align:start position:0%
themselves from the affected environment
 
02:52:54.469 --> 02:52:54.479 align:start position:0%
as you heard with both of these tools i
 
02:52:56.070 --> 02:52:56.080 align:start position:0%
use the word temporary and i want to
 
02:52:57.269 --> 02:52:57.279 align:start position:0%
emphasize that
 
02:52:58.870 --> 02:52:58.880 align:start position:0%
both of these tools when used in
 
02:53:00.070 --> 02:53:00.080 align:start position:0%
accordance with policy and
 
02:53:01.990 --> 02:53:02.000 align:start position:0%
manufacturer's guidelines create a
 
02:53:03.990 --> 02:53:04.000 align:start position:0%
strong but temporary discomfort to the
 
02:53:06.790 --> 02:53:06.800 align:start position:0%
person exposed
 
02:53:09.670 --> 02:53:09.680 align:start position:0%
the irritation from cs gas begins around
 
02:53:12.469 --> 02:53:12.479 align:start position:0%
20 to 60 seconds after exposure and the
 
02:53:15.990 --> 02:53:16.000 align:start position:0%
effects to quote the cdc are short-lived
 
02:53:18.389 --> 02:53:18.399 align:start position:0%
and commonly resolved 15 to 30 minutes
 
02:53:19.990 --> 02:53:20.000 align:start position:0%
after the person has been removed from
 
02:53:21.269 --> 02:53:21.279 align:start position:0%
the source
 
02:53:23.349 --> 02:53:23.359 align:start position:0%
these are not weapons of war designed to
 
02:53:25.030 --> 02:53:25.040 align:start position:0%
inflict pain and suffering on innocent
 
02:53:27.510 --> 02:53:27.520 align:start position:0%
people they are the exact opposite in
 
02:53:29.110 --> 02:53:29.120 align:start position:0%
that they are designed to provide the
 
02:53:30.790 --> 02:53:30.800 align:start position:0%
police with an option to respond to
 
02:53:33.269 --> 02:53:33.279 align:start position:0%
people intent on doing harm that is less
 
02:53:35.429 --> 02:53:35.439 align:start position:0%
likely to cause death or serious bodily
 
02:53:38.230 --> 02:53:38.240 align:start position:0%
injury than lethal force options they're
 
02:53:38.240 --> 02:53:39.349 align:start position:0%
injury than lethal force options they're
awesome

02:53:39.349 --> 02:53:39.359 align:start position:0%
awesome
 
02:53:40.950 --> 02:53:40.960 align:start position:0%
we do have to limit testimony to two
 
02:53:43.670 --> 02:53:43.680 align:start position:0%
minutes so i would just ask uh if you
 
02:53:43.680 --> 02:53:44.630 align:start position:0%
minutes so i would just ask uh if you
mind

02:53:44.630 --> 02:53:44.640 align:start position:0%
mind
 
02:53:47.110 --> 02:53:47.120 align:start position:0%
coming to a conclusion
 
02:53:49.030 --> 02:53:49.040 align:start position:0%
i'll wrap it up with an example uh the
 
02:53:50.469 --> 02:53:50.479 align:start position:0%
capital rise as we all know that
 
02:53:50.479 --> 02:53:51.590 align:start position:0%
capital rise as we all know that
occurred

02:53:51.590 --> 02:53:51.600 align:start position:0%
occurred
 
02:53:53.110 --> 02:53:53.120 align:start position:0%
and we're all aware of the unarmed
 
02:53:54.870 --> 02:53:54.880 align:start position:0%
protester that was fatally shot by law
 
02:53:54.880 --> 02:53:55.910 align:start position:0%
protester that was fatally shot by law
enforcement

02:53:55.910 --> 02:53:55.920 align:start position:0%
enforcement
 
02:53:58.070 --> 02:53:58.080 align:start position:0%
i would argue that if that
 
02:54:00.230 --> 02:54:00.240 align:start position:0%
law enforcement officer or officers at
 
02:54:01.990 --> 02:54:02.000 align:start position:0%
that scene had
 
02:54:04.230 --> 02:54:04.240 align:start position:0%
less lethal munitions or tear gas they
 
02:54:05.750 --> 02:54:05.760 align:start position:0%
could have deployed those instead of
 
02:54:07.750 --> 02:54:07.760 align:start position:0%
lethal force and we might not have a
 
02:54:10.389 --> 02:54:10.399 align:start position:0%
fatality at the hands of law enforcement
 
02:54:12.870 --> 02:54:12.880 align:start position:0%
in that scenario and the tools mentioned
 
02:54:14.870 --> 02:54:14.880 align:start position:0%
in this bill as with all police use of
 
02:54:16.550 --> 02:54:16.560 align:start position:0%
force options are critical to
 
02:54:18.150 --> 02:54:18.160 align:start position:0%
maintaining safety in order and the
 
02:54:20.309 --> 02:54:20.319 align:start position:0%
answer is not to ban them because this
 
02:54:21.910 --> 02:54:21.920 align:start position:0%
would have a negative impact on suspect
 
02:54:23.750 --> 02:54:23.760 align:start position:0%
and officer safety as well as quality of
 
02:54:25.590 --> 02:54:25.600 align:start position:0%
life in the community especially in
 
02:54:27.670 --> 02:54:27.680 align:start position:0%
times like these society is demanding
 
02:54:30.790 --> 02:54:30.800 align:start position:0%
police use less force thank you sergeant
 
02:54:32.550 --> 02:54:32.560 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony
 
02:54:34.150 --> 02:54:34.160 align:start position:0%
representative harper
 
02:54:36.870 --> 02:54:36.880 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chair thank you uh
 
02:54:38.870 --> 02:54:38.880 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
 
02:54:42.630 --> 02:54:42.640 align:start position:0%
um how often are rubber bullets or
 
02:54:45.910 --> 02:54:45.920 align:start position:0%
tear gas used in new hampshire
 
02:54:47.590 --> 02:54:47.600 align:start position:0%
i can't speak to how often they're used
 
02:54:49.429 --> 02:54:49.439 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire
 
02:54:52.070 --> 02:54:52.080 align:start position:0%
as far as quote unquote rubber bullets
 
02:54:54.550 --> 02:54:54.560 align:start position:0%
nashua doesn't use rubber bullets but as
 
02:54:56.950 --> 02:54:56.960 align:start position:0%
far as left less lethal munitions in
 
02:54:59.340 --> 02:54:59.350 align:start position:0%
nashua it's very seldom
 
02:54:59.350 --> 02:55:01.030 align:start position:0%
nashua it's very seldom
[Music]

02:55:01.030 --> 02:55:01.040 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:55:03.590 --> 02:55:03.600 align:start position:0%
in 2019 i'm referencing our
 
02:55:05.750 --> 02:55:05.760 align:start position:0%
accreditation analysis from that year
 
02:55:07.670 --> 02:55:07.680 align:start position:0%
uh less lethal impact munitions were
 
02:55:11.110 --> 02:55:11.120 align:start position:0%
used six times by nashville in 2019.
 
02:55:13.349 --> 02:55:13.359 align:start position:0%
it's very infrequent and we have never
 
02:55:15.990 --> 02:55:16.000 align:start position:0%
used less lethal impact munitions in a
 
02:55:19.750 --> 02:55:19.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:26.309 --> 02:55:26.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:28.550 --> 02:55:28.560 align:start position:0%
see no further questions i want to thank
 
02:55:30.710 --> 02:55:30.720 align:start position:0%
the sergeant for his testimony
 
02:55:37.510 --> 02:55:37.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:37.520 --> 02:55:39.990 align:start position:0%
 
representative

02:55:39.990 --> 02:55:40.000 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:55:41.429 --> 02:55:41.439 align:start position:0%
is representative
 
02:55:41.439 --> 02:55:54.309 align:start position:0%
is representative
schmidt

02:55:54.309 --> 02:55:54.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:55.429 --> 02:55:55.439 align:start position:0%
assuming the
 
02:55:57.030 --> 02:55:57.040 align:start position:0%
representative can hear us we just want
 
02:55:57.040 --> 02:55:58.389 align:start position:0%
representative can hear us we just want
to remind

02:55:58.389 --> 02:55:58.399 align:start position:0%
to remind
 
02:56:00.070 --> 02:56:00.080 align:start position:0%
everyone to limit the testimony to two
 
02:56:01.750 --> 02:56:01.760 align:start position:0%
minutes once you reach two minutes i
 
02:56:03.110 --> 02:56:03.120 align:start position:0%
will at least let you know the time has
 
02:56:04.309 --> 02:56:04.319 align:start position:0%
come up
 
02:56:06.469 --> 02:56:06.479 align:start position:0%
it's expired now while trying to
 
02:56:11.349 --> 02:56:11.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:11.359 --> 02:56:22.150 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:56:22.150 --> 02:56:22.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:24.070 --> 02:56:24.080 align:start position:0%
representative edwards is raising his
 
02:56:27.110 --> 02:56:27.120 align:start position:0%
hand again
 
02:56:28.790 --> 02:56:28.800 align:start position:0%
you want to bring edwards and i'll look
 
02:56:29.910 --> 02:56:29.920 align:start position:0%
for smiths
 
02:56:33.670 --> 02:56:33.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:34.710 --> 02:56:34.720 align:start position:0%
if it doesn't work we're going to
 
02:56:36.150 --> 02:56:36.160 align:start position:0%
conclude that the the chair will
 
02:56:37.670 --> 02:56:37.680 align:start position:0%
conclude that the technical difficulties
 
02:56:40.309 --> 02:56:40.319 align:start position:0%
disarm representative edwards is it all
 
02:56:42.070 --> 02:56:42.080 align:start position:0%
right representative this is
 
02:56:43.670 --> 02:56:43.680 align:start position:0%
representative edwards can you hear me
 
02:56:43.680 --> 02:56:44.550 align:start position:0%
representative edwards can you hear me
now

02:56:44.550 --> 02:56:44.560 align:start position:0%
now
 
02:56:46.389 --> 02:56:46.399 align:start position:0%
yes loud and clear
 
02:56:48.469 --> 02:56:48.479 align:start position:0%
okay so i moved to a different computer
 
02:56:50.550 --> 02:56:50.560 align:start position:0%
so i'm representative jess edwards
 
02:56:52.950 --> 02:56:52.960 align:start position:0%
representing auburn chester and sandown
 
02:56:55.990 --> 02:56:56.000 align:start position:0%
i'm opposed to h.b 564.
 
02:56:57.750 --> 02:56:57.760 align:start position:0%
uh i'm old enough
 
02:56:59.110 --> 02:56:59.120 align:start position:0%
to remember
 
02:57:02.309 --> 02:57:02.319 align:start position:0%
um you know the riots of the 60s uh and
 
02:57:05.110 --> 02:57:05.120 align:start position:0%
civil disturbance uh since then
 
02:57:08.550 --> 02:57:08.560 align:start position:0%
and i think it's just a mistake with all
 
02:57:10.950 --> 02:57:10.960 align:start position:0%
the effort that got put into creating
 
02:57:13.269 --> 02:57:13.279 align:start position:0%
non-lethal force to give our law
 
02:57:13.279 --> 02:57:14.469 align:start position:0%
non-lethal force to give our law
enforcement

02:57:14.469 --> 02:57:14.479 align:start position:0%
enforcement
 
02:57:17.190 --> 02:57:17.200 align:start position:0%
uh other options to deal with
 
02:57:17.200 --> 02:57:18.070 align:start position:0%
uh other options to deal with
um

02:57:18.070 --> 02:57:18.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:57:18.080 --> 02:57:19.670 align:start position:0%
um
mobs

02:57:19.670 --> 02:57:19.680 align:start position:0%
mobs
 
02:57:19.680 --> 02:57:21.190 align:start position:0%
mobs
that

02:57:21.190 --> 02:57:21.200 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:57:23.910 --> 02:57:23.920 align:start position:0%
it would be foolish and short-sighted i
 
02:57:26.389 --> 02:57:26.399 align:start position:0%
think to remove it as an option in
 
02:57:26.399 --> 02:57:27.910 align:start position:0%
think to remove it as an option in
statute

02:57:27.910 --> 02:57:27.920 align:start position:0%
statute
 
02:57:30.469 --> 02:57:30.479 align:start position:0%
in practice they make make the law
 
02:57:33.030 --> 02:57:33.040 align:start position:0%
enforcement may make other decisions
 
02:57:34.790 --> 02:57:34.800 align:start position:0%
but i don't think this is an area we
 
02:57:37.110 --> 02:57:37.120 align:start position:0%
want to tie their hands

organizer from that from that
 
03:00:00.640 --> 03:00:02.150 align:start position:0%

so returning to my testimony the
 
03:00:10.870 --> 03:00:10.880 align:start position:0%
peaceful demonstrations that occurred
 
03:00:12.710 --> 03:00:12.720 align:start position:0%
both here at home and across the country
 
03:00:14.150 --> 03:00:14.160 align:start position:0%
make up what has been called the largest
 
03:00:15.990 --> 03:00:16.000 align:start position:0%
civil rights movement in modern american
 
03:00:17.990 --> 03:00:18.000 align:start position:0%
history although these protests were
 
03:00:19.590 --> 03:00:19.600 align:start position:0%
overwhelmingly peaceful many of them
 
03:00:21.110 --> 03:00:21.120 align:start position:0%
were met with a highly militarized
 
03:00:22.790 --> 03:00:22.800 align:start position:0%
police presence and cities like
 
03:00:24.550 --> 03:00:24.560 align:start position:0%
washington new york and even boston
 
03:00:26.790 --> 03:00:26.800 align:start position:0%
demonstrators who had committed no crime
 
03:00:28.389 --> 03:00:28.399 align:start position:0%
and were only exercising their
 
03:00:30.550 --> 03:00:30.560 align:start position:0%
constitutional rights were met with tear
 
03:00:32.550 --> 03:00:32.560 align:start position:0%
gas and rubber bullets thousands of
 
03:00:34.550 --> 03:00:34.560 align:start position:0%
people were injured as a direct result
 
03:00:36.710 --> 03:00:36.720 align:start position:0%
they were maimed they were brutalized in
 
03:00:38.550 --> 03:00:38.560 align:start position:0%
some cases they have lasting injuries
 
03:00:40.630 --> 03:00:40.640 align:start position:0%
that include the loss of an eye leg or
 
03:00:42.710 --> 03:00:42.720 align:start position:0%
other bodily feature
 
03:00:44.630 --> 03:00:44.640 align:start position:0%
as the sergeant on here earlier
 
03:00:46.389 --> 03:00:46.399 align:start position:0%
described rubber bullets are described
 
03:00:48.469 --> 03:00:48.479 align:start position:0%
as non-lethal but that is not entirely
 
03:00:50.790 --> 03:00:50.800 align:start position:0%
accurate they can cause extreme harm for
 
03:00:52.870 --> 03:00:52.880 align:start position:0%
the rest of a person's life and in some
 
03:00:55.030 --> 03:00:55.040 align:start position:0%
cases they can even cause death if you
 
03:00:57.030 --> 03:00:57.040 align:start position:0%
oppose the action of firing live
 
03:00:58.790 --> 03:00:58.800 align:start position:0%
ammunition into a crowd of peaceful
 
03:01:00.870 --> 03:01:00.880 align:start position:0%
demonstrators because it is a massacre
 
03:01:02.550 --> 03:01:02.560 align:start position:0%
why would you not hold rubber bullets to
 
03:01:04.870 --> 03:01:04.880 align:start position:0%
the same standard the use of tear gas is
 
03:01:07.030 --> 03:01:07.040 align:start position:0%
similarly destructive tear gas is a
 
03:01:08.950 --> 03:01:08.960 align:start position:0%
chemical agent that can have that can
 
03:01:10.950 --> 03:01:10.960 align:start position:0%
cause respiratory burns allergic
 
03:01:13.030 --> 03:01:13.040 align:start position:0%
reactions and respiratory distress
 
03:01:15.349 --> 03:01:15.359 align:start position:0%
people have died after being tear gassed
 
03:01:18.070 --> 03:01:18.080 align:start position:0%
the 1925 geneva protocol bans the use of
 
03:01:19.910 --> 03:01:19.920 align:start position:0%
tear gas and war so how can it be
 
03:01:22.950 --> 03:01:22.960 align:start position:0%
considered suitable for use on civilians
 
03:01:24.630 --> 03:01:24.640 align:start position:0%
thankfully our organizers at black lives
 
03:01:25.990 --> 03:01:26.000 align:start position:0%
matter and new hampshire were not tear
 
03:01:27.349 --> 03:01:27.359 align:start position:0%
gased or shot with rubber bullets this
 
03:01:29.349 --> 03:01:29.359 align:start position:0%
summer but we could have been there was
 
03:01:31.269 --> 03:01:31.279 align:start position:0%
increased police presence at almost all
 
03:01:33.030 --> 03:01:33.040 align:start position:0%
of our events the national guard had
 
03:01:34.870 --> 03:01:34.880 align:start position:0%
been calling for vigils in nashua and
 
03:01:37.349 --> 03:01:37.359 align:start position:0%
manchester this could have been us and
 
03:01:39.190 --> 03:01:39.200 align:start position:0%
it could have been your constituents
 
03:01:42.630 --> 03:01:42.640 align:start position:0%
your job as a legislator is to prevent
 
03:01:44.870 --> 03:01:44.880 align:start position:0%
this legislation is about prevention
 
03:01:47.030 --> 03:01:47.040 align:start position:0%
it's about public safety it's about not
 
03:01:48.710 --> 03:01:48.720 align:start position:0%
waiting for someone to lose an eye or
 
03:01:51.510 --> 03:01:51.520 align:start position:0%
leg before we take action let us act now
 
03:01:53.670 --> 03:01:53.680 align:start position:0%
before it is too late and let me be very
 
03:01:55.269 --> 03:01:55.279 align:start position:0%
clear because this is referenced in the
 
03:01:56.950 --> 03:01:56.960 align:start position:0%
amendment this relates to peaceful
 
03:01:59.190 --> 03:01:59.200 align:start position:0%
demonstrators for someone to compare us
 
03:02:00.870 --> 03:02:00.880 align:start position:0%
to the terrorists that marched on the
 
03:02:03.750 --> 03:02:03.760 align:start position:0%
capitol and stormed that that building
 
03:02:05.990 --> 03:02:06.000 align:start position:0%
is disgusting and frankly the casual
 
03:02:08.070 --> 03:02:08.080 align:start position:0%
racism that has gone on in this hearing
 
03:02:10.230 --> 03:02:10.240 align:start position:0%
is disgusting we are talking about
 
03:02:12.070 --> 03:02:12.080 align:start position:0%
unarmed peaceful demonstrators that are
 
03:02:14.070 --> 03:02:14.080 align:start position:0%
your constituents they marched for peace
 
03:02:16.790 --> 03:02:16.800 align:start position:0%
equity and justice
 
03:02:18.070 --> 03:02:18.080 align:start position:0%
right excuse me
 
03:02:20.469 --> 03:02:20.479 align:start position:0%
the witness will suspend
 
03:02:22.710 --> 03:02:22.720 align:start position:0%
the chair does not receive any testimony
 
03:02:25.190 --> 03:02:25.200 align:start position:0%
today to be racist towards anybody and
 
03:02:27.590 --> 03:02:27.600 align:start position:0%
i i don't i hope no one
 
03:02:29.750 --> 03:02:29.760 align:start position:0%
and i'm from speaking on behalf of the

said anything that was racist or
 
03:02:35.429 --> 03:02:35.439 align:start position:0%
inappropriate that all 21 members of
 
03:02:36.710 --> 03:02:36.720 align:start position:0%
this committee would stand at the same
 
03:02:36.720 --> 03:02:39.269 align:start position:0%
this committee would stand at the same
time

03:02:39.269 --> 03:02:39.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:41.030 --> 03:02:41.040 align:start position:0%
anything of that nature i did not
 
03:02:42.469 --> 03:02:42.479 align:start position:0%
perceive it and
 
03:02:44.389 --> 03:02:44.399 align:start position:0%
i welcome anyone on this committee if
 
03:02:47.429 --> 03:02:47.439 align:start position:0%

i'm just you're saying that other
 
03:03:04.870 --> 03:03:04.880 align:start position:0%
witnesses were so
 
03:03:10.070 --> 03:03:10.080 align:start position:0%

i have nothing further to say other than
 
03:03:18.389 --> 03:03:18.399 align:start position:0%
the fact that whoever laughed this is
 
03:03:21.190 --> 03:03:21.200 align:start position:0%
not a funny thing the act of shooting
 
03:03:22.710 --> 03:03:22.720 align:start position:0%
someone with a rubber bullet or tear
 
03:03:24.550 --> 03:03:24.560 align:start position:0%
gassing them to death is not funny and
 
03:03:29.670 --> 03:03:29.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:31.030 --> 03:03:31.040 align:start position:0%

03:03:36.389 --> 03:03:36.399 align:start position:0%
thank you uh
 
03:03:38.389 --> 03:03:38.399 align:start position:0%
chair for recognizing me to ask a
 
03:03:41.269 --> 03:03:41.279 align:start position:0%
question and thank you jordan for
 
03:03:43.750 --> 03:03:43.760 align:start position:0%
your words today um
 
03:03:46.230 --> 03:03:46.240 align:start position:0%
do you know of other events conducted by
 
03:03:48.790 --> 03:03:48.800 align:start position:0%
other local groups in new hampshire
 
03:03:51.670 --> 03:03:51.680 align:start position:0%
that had a similar protest or even they
 
03:03:53.990 --> 03:03:54.000 align:start position:0%
they had weapons on them were met with
 
03:03:57.349 --> 03:03:57.359 align:start position:0%
the same amount of police presence
 
03:03:59.269 --> 03:03:59.279 align:start position:0%
i do not and i really appreciate you
 
03:04:00.870 --> 03:04:00.880 align:start position:0%
bringing that up because we had armed
 
03:04:02.710 --> 03:04:02.720 align:start position:0%
militias who were walking around our
 
03:04:05.269 --> 03:04:05.279 align:start position:0%
state capitol with ak-47s and they
 
03:04:06.870 --> 03:04:06.880 align:start position:0%
certainly were not met by the national
 
03:04:08.550 --> 03:04:08.560 align:start position:0%
guard they weren't met with increased
 
03:04:10.230 --> 03:04:10.240 align:start position:0%
presence by local and state law
 
03:04:13.590 --> 03:04:13.600 align:start position:0%
enforcement but we teenagers unarmed
 
03:04:15.670 --> 03:04:15.680 align:start position:0%
with water bottles as you described
 
03:04:17.429 --> 03:04:17.439 align:start position:0%
earlier were met with that kind of
 
03:04:19.349 --> 03:04:19.359 align:start position:0%
militarized police presence there's a
 
03:04:31.429 --> 03:04:31.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:33.349 --> 03:04:33.359 align:start position:0%
see no further
 
03:04:36.230 --> 03:04:36.240 align:start position:0%
representative testament
 
03:04:38.630 --> 03:04:38.640 align:start position:0%
thank you for allowing me the question
 
03:04:44.870 --> 03:04:44.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:47.030 --> 03:04:47.040 align:start position:0%
are you are you saying that
 
03:04:48.950 --> 03:04:48.960 align:start position:0%
other people who protested in front of
 
03:04:51.429 --> 03:04:51.439 align:start position:0%
the state capitol
 
03:04:54.389 --> 03:04:54.399 align:start position:0%
did not have a presence of police
 
03:04:55.910 --> 03:04:55.920 align:start position:0%
and so on
 
03:04:58.309 --> 03:04:58.319 align:start position:0%
or just blm had a
 
03:05:01.349 --> 03:05:01.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:02.950 --> 03:05:02.960 align:start position:0%
i'm saying what i said so i'm a little
 
03:05:04.550 --> 03:05:04.560 align:start position:0%
confused by your question can you maybe
 
03:05:07.349 --> 03:05:07.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:08.790 --> 03:05:08.800 align:start position:0%
you're not a customer would you like to
 
03:05:10.790 --> 03:05:10.800 align:start position:0%
clarify your clarifier
 
03:05:12.070 --> 03:05:12.080 align:start position:0%
you said
 
03:05:12.080 --> 03:05:14.070 align:start position:0%
you said
that

03:05:14.070 --> 03:05:14.080 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:05:16.230 --> 03:05:16.240 align:start position:0%
you were there or some of your people
 
03:05:17.990 --> 03:05:18.000 align:start position:0%
were there
 
03:05:19.910 --> 03:05:19.920 align:start position:0%
armed with nothing but
 
03:05:21.429 --> 03:05:21.439 align:start position:0%
water bottles and there were a lot of
 
03:05:21.439 --> 03:05:22.550 align:start position:0%
water bottles and there were a lot of
police

03:05:22.550 --> 03:05:22.560 align:start position:0%
police
 
03:05:25.910 --> 03:05:25.920 align:start position:0%
there were other people armed and
 
03:05:29.110 --> 03:05:29.120 align:start position:0%
they didn't have any police
 
03:05:31.510 --> 03:05:31.520 align:start position:0%
it that just it funnels me
 
03:05:31.520 --> 03:05:32.710 align:start position:0%
it that just it funnels me
because

03:05:32.710 --> 03:05:32.720 align:start position:0%
because
 
03:05:34.309 --> 03:05:34.319 align:start position:0%
you know i've been there when there are
 
03:05:37.190 --> 03:05:37.200 align:start position:0%
police and certainly there aren't people
 
03:05:39.269 --> 03:05:39.279 align:start position:0%
so i just want to make it very clear and
 
03:05:40.790 --> 03:05:40.800 align:start position:0%
i hope that we're being we're
 
03:05:42.389 --> 03:05:42.399 align:start position:0%
approaching this conversation in good
 
03:05:44.070 --> 03:05:44.080 align:start position:0%
faith and being intellectually honest
 
03:05:45.510 --> 03:05:45.520 align:start position:0%
here because there's a clear difference
 
03:05:47.349 --> 03:05:47.359 align:start position:0%
between a state police captain showing
 
03:05:49.990 --> 03:05:50.000 align:start position:0%
up to meet a group of armed protesters
 
03:05:52.309 --> 03:05:52.319 align:start position:0%
and the national guard being called out
 
03:05:54.070 --> 03:05:54.080 align:start position:0%
on 22 year olds who are holding a
 
03:05:55.830 --> 03:05:55.840 align:start position:0%
peaceful vigil i hope we can make that
 
03:06:12.950 --> 03:06:12.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:12.960 --> 03:06:14.550 align:start position:0%
 
online

03:06:14.550 --> 03:06:14.560 align:start position:0%
online
 
03:06:16.550 --> 03:06:16.560 align:start position:0%
but i hope so
 
03:06:19.110 --> 03:06:19.120 align:start position:0%
thanks for uh thank you mr chairman
 
03:06:21.110 --> 03:06:21.120 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
03:06:23.110 --> 03:06:23.120 align:start position:0%
my question is have you found that there
 
03:06:23.120 --> 03:06:24.630 align:start position:0%
my question is have you found that there
are

03:06:24.630 --> 03:06:24.640 align:start position:0%
are
 
03:06:27.590 --> 03:06:27.600 align:start position:0%
a notable number of children or family
 
03:06:27.600 --> 03:06:28.630 align:start position:0%
a notable number of children or family
pets

03:06:28.630 --> 03:06:28.640 align:start position:0%
pets
 
03:06:31.110 --> 03:06:31.120 align:start position:0%
that are brought to
 
03:06:33.910 --> 03:06:33.920 align:start position:0%
these protests that you participate in
 
03:06:34.920 --> 03:06:34.930 align:start position:0%
and um
 
03:06:34.930 --> 03:06:37.750 align:start position:0%
and um
[Music]

03:06:37.750 --> 03:06:37.760 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
03:06:39.830 --> 03:06:39.840 align:start position:0%
would you consider it appropriate for
 
03:06:41.910 --> 03:06:41.920 align:start position:0%
children and families to speak tear gas
 
03:06:43.990 --> 03:06:44.000 align:start position:0%
or hit with forever bullets if i just
 
03:06:46.070 --> 03:06:46.080 align:start position:0%
remind the member
 
03:06:47.990 --> 03:06:48.000 align:start position:0%
ask one it's easier for the witness to
 
03:06:49.429 --> 03:06:49.439 align:start position:0%
answer the question ask one at a time i
 
03:06:50.630 --> 03:06:50.640 align:start position:0%
will recognize you for a follow-up
 
03:06:52.950 --> 03:06:52.960 align:start position:0%
question but it will overlap two
 
03:06:54.870 --> 03:06:54.880 align:start position:0%
questions isn't necessary
 
03:06:57.030 --> 03:06:57.040 align:start position:0%
i appreciate the question representative
 
03:06:58.469 --> 03:06:58.479 align:start position:0%
and it's actually quite easy for me to
 
03:07:00.870 --> 03:07:00.880 align:start position:0%
answer both i do believe that it is
 
03:07:03.349 --> 03:07:03.359 align:start position:0%
wildly inappropriate for
 
03:07:06.070 --> 03:07:06.080 align:start position:0%
when you are at an event what we call
 
03:07:07.750 --> 03:07:07.760 align:start position:0%
our protest family events because we
 
03:07:09.349 --> 03:07:09.359 align:start position:0%
have people uh that are
 
03:07:11.590 --> 03:07:11.600 align:start position:0%
multi-generational multiracial from
 
03:07:13.670 --> 03:07:13.680 align:start position:0%
every age group we have pets we have
 
03:07:15.510 --> 03:07:15.520 align:start position:0%
small children that show up to hear us
 
03:07:17.510 --> 03:07:17.520 align:start position:0%
speak so yes that is something that
 
03:07:19.429 --> 03:07:19.439 align:start position:0%
occurs and it's very very inappropriate
 
03:07:22.630 --> 03:07:22.640 align:start position:0%
it is disturbing that like i said these
 
03:07:24.070 --> 03:07:24.080 align:start position:0%
folks that are coming to these protests
 
03:07:25.429 --> 03:07:25.439 align:start position:0%
they are unarmed and they are peaceful
 
03:07:26.710 --> 03:07:26.720 align:start position:0%
and they are met with such
 
03:07:34.790 --> 03:07:34.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:36.710 --> 03:07:36.720 align:start position:0%
seeing no further questions
 
03:07:47.510 --> 03:07:47.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:49.910 --> 03:07:49.920 align:start position:0%
mr chairman now the next speaker is
 
03:07:52.150 --> 03:07:52.160 align:start position:0%

03:08:06.469 --> 03:08:06.479 align:start position:0%
good afternoon thank you mr chair and
 
03:08:07.910 --> 03:08:07.920 align:start position:0%
members of the committee my name is
 
03:08:09.510 --> 03:08:09.520 align:start position:0%
jeannie herreska i'm the political
 
03:08:10.870 --> 03:08:10.880 align:start position:0%
director for the american civil
 
03:08:12.790 --> 03:08:12.800 align:start position:0%
liberties union of new hampshire
 
03:08:14.469 --> 03:08:14.479 align:start position:0%
and i appreciate the opportunity to
 
03:08:18.070 --> 03:08:18.080 align:start position:0%
testify in support of hbe 564. i just
 
03:08:19.830 --> 03:08:19.840 align:start position:0%
want to know to the top that we support
 
03:08:21.269 --> 03:08:21.279 align:start position:0%
the amendment
 
03:08:24.630 --> 03:08:24.640 align:start position:0%
that representative conley has proposed
 
03:08:26.469 --> 03:08:26.479 align:start position:0%
we fully support
 
03:08:28.550 --> 03:08:28.560 align:start position:0%
not making the bill so it's not so
 
03:08:28.560 --> 03:08:29.990 align:start position:0%
not making the bill so it's not so
prohibitive

03:08:29.990 --> 03:08:30.000 align:start position:0%
prohibitive
 
03:08:32.389 --> 03:08:32.399 align:start position:0%
our goal is to create some guard rails
 
03:08:35.110 --> 03:08:35.120 align:start position:0%
around the use of these weapons
 
03:08:37.110 --> 03:08:37.120 align:start position:0%
not necessarily to prohibit them
 
03:08:37.120 --> 03:08:38.309 align:start position:0%
not necessarily to prohibit them
outright

03:08:38.309 --> 03:08:38.319 align:start position:0%
outright
 
03:08:40.150 --> 03:08:40.160 align:start position:0%
and i just want to mention i want to go
 
03:08:41.670 --> 03:08:41.680 align:start position:0%
back to what sergeant lang said because
 
03:08:43.590 --> 03:08:43.600 align:start position:0%
he said a couple really important things
 
03:08:47.030 --> 03:08:47.040 align:start position:0%
he said these are not weapons of war
 
03:08:49.910 --> 03:08:49.920 align:start position:0%
and i'm not sure he knew just how apt
 
03:08:51.910 --> 03:08:51.920 align:start position:0%
that was these weapons have actually
 
03:08:54.550 --> 03:08:54.560 align:start position:0%
been banned uh during wartime by
 
03:08:57.590 --> 03:08:57.600 align:start position:0%
international law the 1925 geneva
 
03:09:00.230 --> 03:09:00.240 align:start position:0%
protocol prohibits tear gas and the
 
03:09:02.550 --> 03:09:02.560 align:start position:0%
chemical weapons convention prohibit
 
03:09:05.830 --> 03:09:05.840 align:start position:0%
tear gas in times of war and yet somehow
 
03:09:07.830 --> 03:09:07.840 align:start position:0%
this weapon is still allowed to be used
 
03:09:09.269 --> 03:09:09.279 align:start position:0%
on our neighborhoods and in our
 
03:09:11.590 --> 03:09:11.600 align:start position:0%
communities and so again our goal is not
 
03:09:13.830 --> 03:09:13.840 align:start position:0%
to prohibit them um
 
03:09:15.429 --> 03:09:15.439 align:start position:0%
it's really to just make sure that
 
03:09:17.830 --> 03:09:17.840 align:start position:0%
they're not being used indiscriminately
 
03:09:19.990 --> 03:09:20.000 align:start position:0%
or inappropriately
 
03:09:22.630 --> 03:09:22.640 align:start position:0%
um again sergeant lang mentioned using
 
03:09:24.550 --> 03:09:24.560 align:start position:0%
these weapons against armed or dangerous
 
03:09:26.150 --> 03:09:26.160 align:start position:0%
persons and i think that's the
 
03:09:28.150 --> 03:09:28.160 align:start position:0%
distinction we're trying to make we're
 
03:09:30.469 --> 03:09:30.479 align:start position:0%
trying to make sure that when these
 
03:09:33.030 --> 03:09:33.040 align:start position:0%
weapons are used it's because there is
 
03:09:35.190 --> 03:09:35.200 align:start position:0%
an imminent threat that they're not
 
03:09:37.910 --> 03:09:37.920 align:start position:0%
being used for crowd control that rubber
 
03:09:40.070 --> 03:09:40.080 align:start position:0%
bullets are not being indiscriminately
 
03:09:43.110 --> 03:09:43.120 align:start position:0%
shot into a crowd um because that's when
 
03:09:44.870 --> 03:09:44.880 align:start position:0%
they're really dangerous when they're in
 
03:09:47.510 --> 03:09:47.520 align:start position:0%
indiscriminately and disproportionately
 
03:09:49.910 --> 03:09:49.920 align:start position:0%
used um so i would really encourage the
 
03:09:51.590 --> 03:09:51.600 align:start position:0%
committee to look at the amendment that
 
03:09:54.309 --> 03:09:54.319 align:start position:0%
representative conley proposed um and
 
03:09:56.150 --> 03:09:56.160 align:start position:0%
take this opportunity to create just
 
03:09:58.950 --> 03:09:58.960 align:start position:0%
some common sense guard rails around the
 
03:10:01.429 --> 03:10:01.439 align:start position:0%
use of these weapons um and with that
 
03:10:07.910 --> 03:10:07.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:09.429 --> 03:10:09.439 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your testimony
 
03:10:11.030 --> 03:10:11.040 align:start position:0%
representative comey
 
03:10:13.030 --> 03:10:13.040 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
03:10:15.990 --> 03:10:16.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:18.070 --> 03:10:18.080 align:start position:0%
are you aware of any cities or towns or
 
03:10:19.750 --> 03:10:19.760 align:start position:0%
states that have
 
03:10:22.550 --> 03:10:22.560 align:start position:0%
taken the step that is proposed in the
 
03:10:23.830 --> 03:10:23.840 align:start position:0%
in the bill
 
03:10:25.990 --> 03:10:26.000 align:start position:0%
or the amendment that the committee has
 
03:10:26.000 --> 03:10:27.670 align:start position:0%
or the amendment that the committee has
before

03:10:27.670 --> 03:10:27.680 align:start position:0%
before
 
03:10:29.110 --> 03:10:29.120 align:start position:0%
uh thank you representative for that
 
03:10:30.710 --> 03:10:30.720 align:start position:0%
question and the answer is yes there
 
03:10:32.870 --> 03:10:32.880 align:start position:0%
have been a number of towns and cities
 
03:10:35.429 --> 03:10:35.439 align:start position:0%
particularly in the last year
 
03:10:37.830 --> 03:10:37.840 align:start position:0%
that have banned or restricted the use
 
03:10:40.389 --> 03:10:40.399 align:start position:0%
of tear gas and rubber bullets or of of
 
03:10:42.230 --> 03:10:42.240 align:start position:0%
projectiles as
 
03:10:43.830 --> 03:10:43.840 align:start position:0%
others have referenced
 
03:10:46.550 --> 03:10:46.560 align:start position:0%
and colorado actually passed legislation
 
03:10:47.910 --> 03:10:47.920 align:start position:0%
last year
 
03:10:49.670 --> 03:10:49.680 align:start position:0%
to prohibit law enforcement from
 
03:10:51.670 --> 03:10:51.680 align:start position:0%
shooting rubber bullets indiscriminately
 
03:10:53.830 --> 03:10:53.840 align:start position:0%
into a crowd and targeting rubber
 
03:10:57.190 --> 03:10:57.200 align:start position:0%
bullets at someone's head torso or back
 
03:10:59.429 --> 03:10:59.439 align:start position:0%
and that same legislation colorado also
 
03:11:01.349 --> 03:11:01.359 align:start position:0%
prohibited using tear gas or pepper
 
03:11:04.070 --> 03:11:04.080 align:start position:0%
spray without first warning the crowd
 
03:11:05.990 --> 03:11:06.000 align:start position:0%
and giving people time in a route to
 
03:11:06.000 --> 03:11:07.269 align:start position:0%
and giving people time in a route to
disperse

03:11:07.269 --> 03:11:07.279 align:start position:0%
disperse
 
03:11:09.510 --> 03:11:09.520 align:start position:0%
and so i i flagged the colorado example
 
03:11:11.349 --> 03:11:11.359 align:start position:0%
again as something that doesn't prohibit
 
03:11:13.429 --> 03:11:13.439 align:start position:0%
these these weapons outright but really
 
03:11:16.309 --> 03:11:16.319 align:start position:0%
creates some common sense guard rails
 
03:11:22.389 --> 03:11:22.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:26.309 --> 03:11:26.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:29.190 --> 03:11:29.200 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair for and thank you to
 
03:11:31.429 --> 03:11:31.439 align:start position:0%
the witness for taking the question
 
03:11:34.870 --> 03:11:34.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:38.630 --> 03:11:38.640 align:start position:0%
cite any instances where
 
03:11:41.990 --> 03:11:42.000 align:start position:0%
the use of tear gas
 
03:11:43.910 --> 03:11:43.920 align:start position:0%
would be used for crowd control and i'm
 
03:11:45.510 --> 03:11:45.520 align:start position:0%
thinking maybe of where somebody's
 
03:11:47.429 --> 03:11:47.439 align:start position:0%
blocking a block or people have been
 
03:11:50.950 --> 03:11:50.960 align:start position:0%
occupied a space for a month or more and
 
03:11:53.269 --> 03:11:53.279 align:start position:0%
the only option as i see it from this
 
03:11:54.870 --> 03:11:54.880 align:start position:0%
bill is that the police would have to
 
03:11:54.880 --> 03:11:55.910 align:start position:0%
bill is that the police would have to
use

03:11:55.910 --> 03:11:55.920 align:start position:0%
use
 
03:11:57.910 --> 03:11:57.920 align:start position:0%
shields and batons
 
03:12:00.150 --> 03:12:00.160 align:start position:0%
to move the people i'm just wondering if
 
03:12:02.550 --> 03:12:02.560 align:start position:0%
yours your position is to support some
 
03:12:04.630 --> 03:12:04.640 align:start position:0%
use of tear gas and i don't think the
 
03:12:07.830 --> 03:12:07.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:09.910 --> 03:12:09.920 align:start position:0%
i appreciate the question um i think the
 
03:12:12.070 --> 03:12:12.080 align:start position:0%
example that's come up in the past year
 
03:12:15.190 --> 03:12:15.200 align:start position:0%
is to use tear gas to enforce a curfew
 
03:12:18.469 --> 03:12:18.479 align:start position:0%
um and given that tear gas
 
03:12:21.269 --> 03:12:21.279 align:start position:0%
can actually be very very harmful and
 
03:12:23.510 --> 03:12:23.520 align:start position:0%
i'll note that it's particularly harmful
 
03:12:25.750 --> 03:12:25.760 align:start position:0%
for people with respiratory illnesses
 
03:12:28.389 --> 03:12:28.399 align:start position:0%
including covid19
 
03:12:30.469 --> 03:12:30.479 align:start position:0%
so tear gas is actually particularly
 
03:12:32.710 --> 03:12:32.720 align:start position:0%
dangerous right now
 
03:12:34.710 --> 03:12:34.720 align:start position:0%
when people's faces are covered and tear
 
03:12:36.230 --> 03:12:36.240 align:start position:0%
gas can actually get caught between
 
03:12:38.230 --> 03:12:38.240 align:start position:0%
their mask and their face and when
 
03:12:40.309 --> 03:12:40.319 align:start position:0%
people may be suffering from respiratory
 
03:12:42.150 --> 03:12:42.160 align:start position:0%
illness but again
 
03:12:43.830 --> 03:12:43.840 align:start position:0%
it was referenced actually earlier i
 
03:12:45.910 --> 03:12:45.920 align:start position:0%
think in the earlier hearing that law
 
03:12:48.389 --> 03:12:48.399 align:start position:0%
enforcement have many tools in their
 
03:12:51.349 --> 03:12:51.359 align:start position:0%
toolbox so i i don't believe that it's
 
03:12:53.830 --> 03:12:53.840 align:start position:0%
you either you use rubber bullets or you
 
03:12:55.830 --> 03:12:55.840 align:start position:0%
use lethal force i don't think those are
 
03:12:58.630 --> 03:12:58.640 align:start position:0%
the two only two options in the toolbox
 
03:13:01.110 --> 03:13:01.120 align:start position:0%
i think there are a lot of options in
 
03:13:02.950 --> 03:13:02.960 align:start position:0%
the law enforcement toolbox and all
 
03:13:05.510 --> 03:13:05.520 align:start position:0%
we're trying to do again is create some
 
03:13:07.670 --> 03:13:07.680 align:start position:0%
common sense limitations on the use of
 
03:13:14.870 --> 03:13:14.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:16.469 --> 03:13:16.479 align:start position:0%
representative testerman
 
03:13:18.230 --> 03:13:18.240 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking my
 
03:13:18.240 --> 03:13:20.389 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking my
question

03:13:20.389 --> 03:13:20.399 align:start position:0%
question
 
03:13:23.830 --> 03:13:23.840 align:start position:0%
you mentioned colorado uh
 
03:13:25.990 --> 03:13:26.000 align:start position:0%
do you know what the laws are in
 
03:13:29.030 --> 03:13:29.040 align:start position:0%
portland or seattle or minneapolis
 
03:13:29.040 --> 03:13:29.990 align:start position:0%
portland or seattle or minneapolis
uh

03:13:29.990 --> 03:13:30.000 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:13:31.349 --> 03:13:31.359 align:start position:0%
you know where there have been
 
03:13:34.710 --> 03:13:34.720 align:start position:0%
large-scale riots for a long time you
 
03:13:37.269 --> 03:13:37.279 align:start position:0%
know do they have a
 
03:13:40.309 --> 03:13:40.319 align:start position:0%
prohibition of rubber bullets and gas
 
03:13:43.030 --> 03:13:43.040 align:start position:0%
and so on i'm not sure i will say
 
03:13:45.269 --> 03:13:45.279 align:start position:0%
minneapolis is undergoing a pretty
 
03:13:47.510 --> 03:13:47.520 align:start position:0%
comprehensive review of its police
 
03:13:49.670 --> 03:13:49.680 align:start position:0%
practices right now
 
03:13:51.670 --> 03:13:51.680 align:start position:0%
so i would not be at all surprised if
 
03:13:53.510 --> 03:13:53.520 align:start position:0%
the use of these weapons are part of
 
03:13:56.150 --> 03:13:56.160 align:start position:0%
that very comprehensive review that
 
03:13:58.630 --> 03:13:58.640 align:start position:0%
they're undertaking
 
03:14:02.229 --> 03:14:02.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:05.130 --> 03:14:05.140 align:start position:0%

[Music]
 
03:14:08.070 --> 03:14:08.080 align:start position:0%
thank you for coming to testify and
 
03:14:10.550 --> 03:14:10.560 align:start position:0%
taking my question i am trying to
 
03:14:12.070 --> 03:14:12.080 align:start position:0%
reconcile a couple of statements you
 
03:14:12.080 --> 03:14:12.870 align:start position:0%
reconcile a couple of statements you
made

03:14:12.870 --> 03:14:12.880 align:start position:0%
made
 
03:14:12.880 --> 03:14:13.750 align:start position:0%
made
first

03:14:13.750 --> 03:14:13.760 align:start position:0%
first
 
03:14:16.469 --> 03:14:16.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:21.349 --> 03:14:21.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:22.830 --> 03:14:22.840 align:start position:0%
legal in
 
03:14:25.670 --> 03:14:25.680 align:start position:0%
war but i thought you
 
03:14:28.550 --> 03:14:28.560 align:start position:0%
said that you allocated there were times
 
03:14:31.030 --> 03:14:31.040 align:start position:0%
when tear gas could be used domestically
 
03:14:33.110 --> 03:14:33.120 align:start position:0%
is that true
 
03:14:34.309 --> 03:14:34.319 align:start position:0%
i think what we're trying to do is
 
03:14:38.389 --> 03:14:38.399 align:start position:0%
strike a balance um i think our sense is
 
03:14:40.469 --> 03:14:40.479 align:start position:0%
it's very difficult to pass a
 
03:14:42.469 --> 03:14:42.479 align:start position:0%
prohibition outright i think you've
 
03:14:44.550 --> 03:14:44.560 align:start position:0%
sensed that in this hearing and so again
 
03:14:46.950 --> 03:14:46.960 align:start position:0%
we're trying to find a balance
 
03:14:48.790 --> 03:14:48.800 align:start position:0%
um and and we think the amendment
 
03:14:51.429 --> 03:14:51.439 align:start position:0%
strikes it um i i think there's a good
 
03:14:53.030 --> 03:14:53.040 align:start position:0%
reason these weapons have been banned in
 
03:14:54.710 --> 03:14:54.720 align:start position:0%
wartime and i do think that that's
 
03:14:57.590 --> 03:14:57.600 align:start position:0%
telling it's indicative of how dangerous
 
03:14:59.510 --> 03:14:59.520 align:start position:0%
these weapons can be
 
03:15:01.990 --> 03:15:02.000 align:start position:0%
um which again to me underscores the
 
03:15:04.309 --> 03:15:04.319 align:start position:0%
need for some real safety protocols
 
03:15:06.630 --> 03:15:06.640 align:start position:0%
around how they're used
 
03:15:09.190 --> 03:15:09.200 align:start position:0%
and that when they are used that the
 
03:15:11.750 --> 03:15:11.760 align:start position:0%
leaf the dangerousness of the weapon is
 
03:15:14.550 --> 03:15:14.560 align:start position:0%
warranted because of the threat being
 
03:15:16.389 --> 03:15:16.399 align:start position:0%
faced that they're not being used simply
 
03:15:18.710 --> 03:15:18.720 align:start position:0%
because somebody's violating a curfew
 
03:15:20.550 --> 03:15:20.560 align:start position:0%
that it's being used because there is
 
03:15:22.469 --> 03:15:22.479 align:start position:0%
somebody who's armed dangerous and
 
03:15:25.110 --> 03:15:25.120 align:start position:0%
trying to attack i i really want to make
 
03:15:27.830 --> 03:15:27.840 align:start position:0%
sure that there's a proportionality to
 
03:15:31.030 --> 03:15:31.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:43.990 --> 03:15:44.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:46.710 --> 03:15:46.720 align:start position:0%
could there be circumstances where
 
03:15:48.790 --> 03:15:48.800 align:start position:0%
rubber bullets were used
 
03:15:50.309 --> 03:15:50.319 align:start position:0%
despite it being a
 
03:15:52.790 --> 03:15:52.800 align:start position:0%
form of non-lethal force it could still
 
03:15:54.070 --> 03:15:54.080 align:start position:0%
be considered
 
03:15:56.469 --> 03:15:56.479 align:start position:0%
excessive force if it was used would you
 
03:15:58.790 --> 03:15:58.800 align:start position:0%
agree with that statement
 
03:16:01.349 --> 03:16:01.359 align:start position:0%
i think so yes again it's situation
 
03:16:03.670 --> 03:16:03.680 align:start position:0%
specific certainly for instance in like
 
03:16:05.670 --> 03:16:05.680 align:start position:0%
short distance to shoot somebody point
 
03:16:07.830 --> 03:16:07.840 align:start position:0%
blank with a rubber bullet um or
 
03:16:09.269 --> 03:16:09.279 align:start position:0%
shooting them in the face for instance
 
03:16:10.950 --> 03:16:10.960 align:start position:0%
like rubber bullets are highly highly
 
03:16:29.030 --> 03:16:29.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:30.790 --> 03:16:30.800 align:start position:0%
see no hands hand raise i want to thank
 
03:16:33.110 --> 03:16:33.120 align:start position:0%
you again for your testimony
 
03:16:39.990 --> 03:16:40.000 align:start position:0%

here waiting for the next build to
 
03:16:59.990 --> 03:17:00.000 align:start position:0%
introduce i listened and listened and i
 
03:17:01.590 --> 03:17:01.600 align:start position:0%
said my god i can't believe the
 
03:17:03.429 --> 03:17:03.439 align:start position:0%
testimony that's coming out
 
03:17:05.590 --> 03:17:05.600 align:start position:0%
to people that are supporting this bill
 
03:17:07.990 --> 03:17:08.000 align:start position:0%
uh first of all as a retired marine and
 
03:17:09.590 --> 03:17:09.600 align:start position:0%
somebody just
 
03:17:10.870 --> 03:17:10.880 align:start position:0%
went to war
 
03:17:10.880 --> 03:17:11.670 align:start position:0%
went to war
uh

03:17:11.670 --> 03:17:11.680 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:17:13.190 --> 03:17:13.200 align:start position:0%
tear gas
 
03:17:15.110 --> 03:17:15.120 align:start position:0%
what does not work against real bullets
 
03:17:17.429 --> 03:17:17.439 align:start position:0%
when they're shooting at you okay uh we
 
03:17:18.950 --> 03:17:18.960 align:start position:0%
believe in the one shot one kill
 
03:17:21.349 --> 03:17:21.359 align:start position:0%
mentality as a marine
 
03:17:23.510 --> 03:17:23.520 align:start position:0%
okay so naturally we're not going to use
 
03:17:26.550 --> 03:17:26.560 align:start position:0%
tear gas our job is to protect the
 
03:17:28.950 --> 03:17:28.960 align:start position:0%
police along with the people that are
 
03:17:30.790 --> 03:17:30.800 align:start position:0%
out there on these peaceful
 
03:17:33.429 --> 03:17:33.439 align:start position:0%
demonstrators that kill cops that burn
 
03:17:36.229 --> 03:17:36.239 align:start position:0%

over those are peaceful demonstrators
 
03:17:43.990 --> 03:17:44.000 align:start position:0%
okay but most of the media the liberal
 
03:17:46.229 --> 03:17:46.239 align:start position:0%
media does not show that stuff
 
03:17:48.070 --> 03:17:48.080 align:start position:0%
um i understand these rubber bullets
 
03:17:50.790 --> 03:17:50.800 align:start position:0%
they have um they don't want this stuff
 
03:17:53.030 --> 03:17:53.040 align:start position:0%
but the police have the right to protect
 
03:17:55.269 --> 03:17:55.279 align:start position:0%
themselves when they're being attacked
 
03:17:57.830 --> 03:17:57.840 align:start position:0%

you representative baldassaro for taking
 
03:19:41.349 --> 03:19:41.359 align:start position:0%
my question
 
03:19:43.750 --> 03:19:43.760 align:start position:0%
are you saying because tear gas is too
 
03:19:45.990 --> 03:19:46.000 align:start position:0%
safe for war that's the reason it was
 
03:19:46.000 --> 03:19:47.830 align:start position:0%
safe for war that's the reason it was
banned

03:19:47.830 --> 03:19:47.840 align:start position:0%
banned
 
03:19:50.389 --> 03:19:50.399 align:start position:0%
no uh what i'm saying is uh when people
 
03:19:52.630 --> 03:19:52.640 align:start position:0%
are shooting at you don't use tear gas
 
03:19:55.510 --> 03:19:55.520 align:start position:0%
tear gas that they use in the the police
 
03:19:58.070 --> 03:19:58.080 align:start position:0%
is not like what we use in the military
 
03:20:00.229 --> 03:20:00.239 align:start position:0%
the tear gas they use is identified for
 
03:20:04.309 --> 03:20:04.319 align:start position:0%
water eyes uh nose uh to blind people uh
 
03:20:06.790 --> 03:20:06.800 align:start position:0%

eyes it is not a lethal weapon as you're
saying

564. as this bill is a necessary step in
 
03:22:52.150 --> 03:22:52.160 align:start position:0%
ending racial injustice in the police
 
03:22:53.990 --> 03:22:54.000 align:start position:0%

unnecessary injury of peaceful
 
03:22:55.600 --> 03:22:57.429 align:start position:0%
unnecessary injury of peaceful
protesters

03:22:57.429 --> 03:22:57.439 align:start position:0%
protesters
 
03:22:59.590 --> 03:22:59.600 align:start position:0%
so for many years weapons such as rubber
 
03:23:01.269 --> 03:23:01.279 align:start position:0%
bullets and tear gas have been deemed
 
03:23:03.830 --> 03:23:03.840 align:start position:0%
non-lethal despite studies increasingly
 
03:23:05.990 --> 03:23:06.000 align:start position:0%
showing otherwise a study done by the
 
03:23:07.910 --> 03:23:07.920 align:start position:0%
british medical journal showed that
 
03:23:09.510 --> 03:23:09.520 align:start position:0%
people who were injured by a rubber
 
03:23:12.070 --> 03:23:12.080 align:start position:0%
bullet 3 percent die from their injuries
 
03:23:15.030 --> 03:23:15.040 align:start position:0%
and 15 suffer a permanent disability as
 
03:23:17.349 --> 03:23:17.359 align:start position:0%
a result and despite being considered
 
03:23:19.190 --> 03:23:19.200 align:start position:0%
non-lethal by law enforcement across the
 
03:23:21.590 --> 03:23:21.600 align:start position:0%
country these weapons are not harmless
 
03:23:23.429 --> 03:23:23.439 align:start position:0%
by any means injuries from rubber
 
03:23:25.510 --> 03:23:25.520 align:start position:0%
bullets can range from bruising to bone
 
03:23:25.520 --> 03:23:26.550 align:start position:0%
bullets can range from bruising to bone
fractures

03:23:26.550 --> 03:23:26.560 align:start position:0%
fractures
 
03:23:28.469 --> 03:23:28.479 align:start position:0%
nerve damage and even damage to vital
 
03:23:30.309 --> 03:23:30.319 align:start position:0%
organs depending on the location of the
 
03:23:32.550 --> 03:23:32.560 align:start position:0%
body in which the victim is hit
 
03:23:34.229 --> 03:23:34.239 align:start position:0%
and though tear gas has been most
 
03:23:36.070 --> 03:23:36.080 align:start position:0%
commonly known to cause watering of the
 
03:23:38.389 --> 03:23:38.399 align:start position:0%
eyes and irritate the nose and mouth
 
03:23:40.389 --> 03:23:40.399 align:start position:0%
when deployed in enclosed spaces this
 
03:23:42.389 --> 03:23:42.399 align:start position:0%
can actually result in chemical burns
 
03:23:45.190 --> 03:23:45.200 align:start position:0%
and vision loss so along with the issues
 
03:23:46.630 --> 03:23:46.640 align:start position:0%
that i've previously stated the
 
03:23:48.389 --> 03:23:48.399 align:start position:0%
difference in police response that has
 
03:23:50.630 --> 03:23:50.640 align:start position:0%
been observed in the january 6 capital
 
03:23:54.150 --> 03:23:54.160 align:start position:0%
riot versus 2020 racial justice protest
 
03:23:56.469 --> 03:23:56.479 align:start position:0%
is brazenly clear and quite
 
03:23:58.389 --> 03:23:58.399 align:start position:0%
quite frankly hypocritical
 
03:24:00.229 --> 03:24:00.239 align:start position:0%
as black lives matter protesters
 
03:24:01.910 --> 03:24:01.920 align:start position:0%
peacefully took to the streets across
 
03:24:04.070 --> 03:24:04.080 align:start position:0%
america they were met with violent shows
 
03:24:05.670 --> 03:24:05.680 align:start position:0%
of force by police who used rubber
 
03:24:07.349 --> 03:24:07.359 align:start position:0%
bullets and tear gas
 
03:24:09.590 --> 03:24:09.600 align:start position:0%
for instance seacoast black lives matter
 
03:24:12.630 --> 03:24:12.640 align:start position:0%
organizer julian julian maduro told npr
 
03:24:14.790 --> 03:24:14.800 align:start position:0%
that she saw violent shows of force
 
03:24:16.870 --> 03:24:16.880 align:start position:0%
against racial justice advocates at a
 
03:24:19.510 --> 03:24:19.520 align:start position:0%
protest she attended in late may of 2020
 
03:24:21.910 --> 03:24:21.920 align:start position:0%
in portland maine however an opposite
 
03:24:23.910 --> 03:24:23.920 align:start position:0%
reaction by law enforcement can be seen
 
03:24:26.070 --> 03:24:26.080 align:start position:0%
during the capital riot that took place
 
03:24:28.389 --> 03:24:28.399 align:start position:0%
earlier this year instead some police
 
03:24:30.150 --> 03:24:30.160 align:start position:0%
officers were filmed taking selfies with
 
03:24:32.309 --> 03:24:32.319 align:start position:0%
rioters and even removing barriers
 
03:24:34.309 --> 03:24:34.319 align:start position:0%
allowing rioters easier access to the
 
03:24:35.590 --> 03:24:35.600 align:start position:0%
capitol building
 
03:24:38.150 --> 03:24:38.160 align:start position:0%
in response to these events president
 
03:24:40.389 --> 03:24:40.399 align:start position:0%
joseph biden tweeted no one can tell me
 
03:24:42.630 --> 03:24:42.640 align:start position:0%
that if this had been a group of black
 
03:24:44.790 --> 03:24:44.800 align:start position:0%
lives matter protesters yesterday that
 
03:24:46.229 --> 03:24:46.239 align:start position:0%
they would have been treated differently
 
03:24:48.309 --> 03:24:48.319 align:start position:0%
than the mob that stormed the capital we
 
03:24:49.670 --> 03:24:49.680 align:start position:0%
all know that's true and it's
 
03:24:49.680 --> 03:24:51.110 align:start position:0%
all know that's true and it's
unacceptable

03:24:51.110 --> 03:24:51.120 align:start position:0%
unacceptable
 
03:24:52.790 --> 03:24:52.800 align:start position:0%
racial bias has been in our policing
 
03:24:55.190 --> 03:24:55.200 align:start position:0%
system for centuries and it's long time
 
03:24:57.429 --> 03:24:57.439 align:start position:0%
past time that action be taken
 
03:25:00.550 --> 03:25:00.560 align:start position:0%
hb 564 and other legislation like it are
 
03:25:02.630 --> 03:25:02.640 align:start position:0%
important steps to take thank you so
 
03:25:04.469 --> 03:25:04.479 align:start position:0%

03:25:43.830 --> 03:25:43.840 align:start position:0%
my name is anthony nero i'm
 
03:25:45.910 --> 03:25:45.920 align:start position:0%
an attorney at bernazani law in nashua
 
03:25:47.990 --> 03:25:48.000 align:start position:0%
i'm speaking in favor of the bill on
 
03:25:49.670 --> 03:25:49.680 align:start position:0%
behalf of the new hampshire association
 
03:25:51.990 --> 03:25:52.000 align:start position:0%
of criminal defense lawyers
 
03:25:53.670 --> 03:25:53.680 align:start position:0%
i would like to say that i
 
03:25:54.950 --> 03:25:54.960 align:start position:0%
agree with
 
03:25:57.030 --> 03:25:57.040 align:start position:0%
the testimony of the representative from
 
03:25:59.670 --> 03:25:59.680 align:start position:0%
black lives matter nashua and the aclu
 
03:25:59.680 --> 03:26:00.630 align:start position:0%
black lives matter nashua and the aclu
and

03:26:00.630 --> 03:26:00.640 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:26:02.309 --> 03:26:02.319 align:start position:0%
they covered a lot of the points i was
 
03:26:04.229 --> 03:26:04.239 align:start position:0%
going to make so i will try not to be
 
03:26:05.750 --> 03:26:05.760 align:start position:0%
repetitive i've submitted written
 
03:26:08.150 --> 03:26:08.160 align:start position:0%
testimony and i trust the committee will
 
03:26:10.550 --> 03:26:10.560 align:start position:0%
review that as well
 
03:26:12.630 --> 03:26:12.640 align:start position:0%
as lawmakers you know quite well that
 
03:26:14.229 --> 03:26:14.239 align:start position:0%
words matter
 
03:26:15.750 --> 03:26:15.760 align:start position:0%
and as this bill is discussed i
 
03:26:17.590 --> 03:26:17.600 align:start position:0%
encourage the body to continue to think
 
03:26:20.870 --> 03:26:20.880 align:start position:0%
about the words we are all using here um
 
03:26:23.269 --> 03:26:23.279 align:start position:0%
tear gas and rubber bullets are not less
 
03:26:25.670 --> 03:26:25.680 align:start position:0%
lethal weapons they are by definition if
 
03:26:29.670 --> 03:26:29.680 align:start position:0%
we look to rsa 6 25 11 roman numeral 5
 
03:26:33.349 --> 03:26:33.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:35.110 --> 03:26:35.120 align:start position:0%
tear gas is a chemical weapon that is
 
03:26:37.510 --> 03:26:37.520 align:start position:0%
banned in the use of war rubber bullets
 
03:26:39.590 --> 03:26:39.600 align:start position:0%
are not rubber they have some rubber in
 
03:26:41.269 --> 03:26:41.279 align:start position:0%
them they also have hard plastics and
 
03:26:41.279 --> 03:26:42.630 align:start position:0%
them they also have hard plastics and
metals

03:26:42.630 --> 03:26:42.640 align:start position:0%
metals
 
03:26:44.550 --> 03:26:44.560 align:start position:0%
and they are bullets however they're
 
03:26:46.870 --> 03:26:46.880 align:start position:0%
fired at high velocities and civilians
 
03:26:49.110 --> 03:26:49.120 align:start position:0%
they cause death they maim people they
 
03:26:51.590 --> 03:26:51.600 align:start position:0%
are imprecise weapons and as a result
 
03:26:53.910 --> 03:26:53.920 align:start position:0%
innocent people suffer great injuries
 
03:26:56.630 --> 03:26:56.640 align:start position:0%
when they are used um i understand there
 
03:26:58.950 --> 03:26:58.960 align:start position:0%
were some questions about have we seen
 
03:27:01.429 --> 03:27:01.439 align:start position:0%
instances or how many uses of these
 
03:27:04.070 --> 03:27:04.080 align:start position:0%
weapons have we seen in law enforcement
 
03:27:06.309 --> 03:27:06.319 align:start position:0%
i think this body should think about are
 
03:27:09.190 --> 03:27:09.200 align:start position:0%
we going to be a reactive or proactive
 
03:27:10.870 --> 03:27:10.880 align:start position:0%
law making body and i think we should be
 
03:27:10.880 --> 03:27:12.630 align:start position:0%
law making body and i think we should be
proactive

03:27:12.630 --> 03:27:12.640 align:start position:0%
proactive
 
03:27:14.070 --> 03:27:14.080 align:start position:0%
there are other approaches to crowd
 
03:27:15.510 --> 03:27:15.520 align:start position:0%
control we haven't really gotten into
 
03:27:17.590 --> 03:27:17.600 align:start position:0%
them today but officers can be trained
 
03:27:19.990 --> 03:27:20.000 align:start position:0%
to negotiate with protesters explain
 
03:27:22.469 --> 03:27:22.479 align:start position:0%
police actions third party negotiators
 
03:27:23.990 --> 03:27:24.000 align:start position:0%
can also be employed to mediate
 
03:27:26.070 --> 03:27:26.080 align:start position:0%
information exchange between the police
 
03:27:27.750 --> 03:27:27.760 align:start position:0%
and the public and these community
 
03:27:29.910 --> 03:27:29.920 align:start position:0%
policing practices which seek to
 
03:27:32.309 --> 03:27:32.319 align:start position:0%
facilitate peaceful political expression
 
03:27:34.150 --> 03:27:34.160 align:start position:0%
rather than repress it can avoid the
 
03:27:36.469 --> 03:27:36.479 align:start position:0%
escalation that often ends in the police
 
03:27:39.269 --> 03:27:39.279 align:start position:0%
use of tear gas or rubber bullets
 
03:27:41.590 --> 03:27:41.600 align:start position:0%
this bill does not take away
 
03:27:44.630 --> 03:27:44.640 align:start position:0%
batons taser hand handheld aerosol
 
03:27:47.110 --> 03:27:47.120 align:start position:0%
pepper sprays i've noted in my comments
 
03:27:47.120 --> 03:27:47.990 align:start position:0%
pepper sprays i've noted in my comments
that

03:27:47.990 --> 03:27:48.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:27:49.349 --> 03:27:49.359 align:start position:0%
i think the language needs to be
 
03:27:51.269 --> 03:27:51.279 align:start position:0%
tightened up however
 
03:27:51.279 --> 03:27:52.309 align:start position:0%
tightened up however
because

03:27:52.309 --> 03:27:52.319 align:start position:0%
because
 
03:27:54.150 --> 03:27:54.160 align:start position:0%
there really isn't a definition tear gas
 
03:27:56.150 --> 03:27:56.160 align:start position:0%
is a is a broad term and i do think it
 
03:27:57.830 --> 03:27:57.840 align:start position:0%
needs to be tightened up a bit to
 
03:27:59.510 --> 03:27:59.520 align:start position:0%
effectuate the purpose of the statute
 
03:28:01.670 --> 03:28:01.680 align:start position:0%
which i think is about crowd control and
 
03:28:04.309 --> 03:28:04.319 align:start position:0%
not taking away um personal
 
03:28:05.990 --> 03:28:06.000 align:start position:0%
weaponry from the officers when they're
 
03:28:12.309 --> 03:28:12.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:13.990 --> 03:28:14.000 align:start position:0%
but by removing chemical agents and
 
03:28:16.710 --> 03:28:16.720 align:start position:0%
projectiles such as rubber bullets
 
03:28:18.469 --> 03:28:18.479 align:start position:0%
from law enforcement's arsenal in this
 
03:28:20.389 --> 03:28:20.399 align:start position:0%
state you will not just be protecting
 
03:28:22.309 --> 03:28:22.319 align:start position:0%
lives but you will also be building
 
03:28:24.710 --> 03:28:24.720 align:start position:0%
trust with the community
 
03:28:26.469 --> 03:28:26.479 align:start position:0%
with respect to i just want to touch on
 
03:28:28.870 --> 03:28:28.880 align:start position:0%
one point that sergeant lang
 
03:28:30.309 --> 03:28:30.319 align:start position:0%
who i
 
03:28:32.710 --> 03:28:32.720 align:start position:0%
know and i respect his work he mentioned
 
03:28:35.030 --> 03:28:35.040 align:start position:0%
the cdc i would refer the committee to
 
03:28:37.830 --> 03:28:37.840 align:start position:0%
my written testimony the cdc does not
 
03:28:39.510 --> 03:28:39.520 align:start position:0%
say this is harmless
 
03:28:41.590 --> 03:28:41.600 align:start position:0%
in fact the cdc
 
03:28:44.070 --> 03:28:44.080 align:start position:0%
has pointed out that
 
03:28:46.790 --> 03:28:46.800 align:start position:0%
tear gas has long-term effects not just
 
03:28:49.510 --> 03:28:49.520 align:start position:0%
short-term and can actually
 
03:28:51.830 --> 03:28:51.840 align:start position:0%
cause internal damage that will make
 
03:28:51.840 --> 03:28:52.710 align:start position:0%
cause internal damage that will make
people

03:28:52.710 --> 03:28:52.720 align:start position:0%
people
 
03:28:54.469 --> 03:28:54.479 align:start position:0%
for the rest of their life susceptible
 
03:28:54.479 --> 03:28:55.269 align:start position:0%
for the rest of their life susceptible
to

03:28:55.269 --> 03:28:55.279 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:28:57.269 --> 03:28:57.279 align:start position:0%
virus disease
 
03:28:59.590 --> 03:28:59.600 align:start position:0%
such as influenza and coronavirus and
 
03:29:00.790 --> 03:29:00.800 align:start position:0%
that's something we really need to be
 
03:29:03.590 --> 03:29:03.600 align:start position:0%
mindful especially nowadays so if
 
03:29:04.870 --> 03:29:04.880 align:start position:0%
there's any questions i'm happy to
 
03:29:07.110 --> 03:29:07.120 align:start position:0%
entertain them and again i would refer
 
03:29:09.030 --> 03:29:09.040 align:start position:0%
to my written testimony
 
03:29:15.349 --> 03:29:15.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:17.110 --> 03:29:17.120 align:start position:0%

03:29:45.429 --> 03:29:45.439 align:start position:0%
nationally but i would love to talk
 
03:29:47.670 --> 03:29:47.680 align:start position:0%
about blm locally because we have three
 
03:29:49.830 --> 03:29:49.840 align:start position:0%
amazing chapters who give back to our
 
03:29:49.840 --> 03:29:50.950 align:start position:0%
amazing chapters who give back to our
community

03:29:50.950 --> 03:29:50.960 align:start position:0%
community
 
03:29:50.960 --> 03:29:52.150 align:start position:0%
community
um

03:29:52.150 --> 03:29:52.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:29:55.030 --> 03:29:55.040 align:start position:0%
and regularly have events throughout the
 
03:29:55.040 --> 03:29:55.990 align:start position:0%
and regularly have events throughout the
state

03:29:55.990 --> 03:29:56.000 align:start position:0%
state
 
03:29:56.000 --> 03:29:57.030 align:start position:0%
state
um

03:29:57.030 --> 03:29:57.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:29:59.030 --> 03:29:59.040 align:start position:0%
they can't speak to how often tear gas
 
03:30:01.030 --> 03:30:01.040 align:start position:0%
and rubber bullets are used because as
 
03:30:03.269 --> 03:30:03.279 align:start position:0%
of yet me and my friends who organize
 
03:30:04.950 --> 03:30:04.960 align:start position:0%
these events with new hampshire blm
 
03:30:06.550 --> 03:30:06.560 align:start position:0%
chapters have had the biggest protest
 
03:30:08.790 --> 03:30:08.800 align:start position:0%
new hampshire has ever seen and has
 
03:30:11.110 --> 03:30:11.120 align:start position:0%
never given them the reason to and it's
 
03:30:13.030 --> 03:30:13.040 align:start position:0%
because they're peaceful and family
 
03:30:15.190 --> 03:30:15.200 align:start position:0%
friendly and
 
03:30:17.190 --> 03:30:17.200 align:start position:0%
hundreds of people go
 
03:30:19.030 --> 03:30:19.040 align:start position:0%
and they have never turned violent and
 
03:30:20.950 --> 03:30:20.960 align:start position:0%
it's because they're meant to shed light
 
03:30:23.269 --> 03:30:23.279 align:start position:0%
on situations that are horrible not
 
03:30:26.309 --> 03:30:26.319 align:start position:0%
become horrible situations themselves
 
03:30:29.750 --> 03:30:29.760 align:start position:0%
um many times i have marched as police
 
03:30:32.150 --> 03:30:32.160 align:start position:0%
and civilians pointed guns at me
 
03:30:34.950 --> 03:30:34.960 align:start position:0%
and i have remained calm how is it that
 
03:30:37.110 --> 03:30:37.120 align:start position:0%
i and your constituents can handle this
 
03:30:39.590 --> 03:30:39.600 align:start position:0%
threat without reacting but a march is
 
03:30:41.110 --> 03:30:41.120 align:start position:0%
seen as a threat
 
03:30:43.269 --> 03:30:43.279 align:start position:0%
and a peaceful one at that
 
03:30:44.870 --> 03:30:44.880 align:start position:0%
i want to emphasize the lack of rubber
 
03:30:46.309 --> 03:30:46.319 align:start position:0%
bullets and tear gas during the capital
 
03:30:47.990 --> 03:30:48.000 align:start position:0%
rights because i think it's important
 
03:30:49.670 --> 03:30:49.680 align:start position:0%
and polarizing as we've seen with the
 
03:30:52.870 --> 03:30:52.880 align:start position:0%
blm marches and protests how is it that
 
03:30:55.269 --> 03:30:55.279 align:start position:0%
there was no tear gas or rubber bullets
 
03:30:57.750 --> 03:30:57.760 align:start position:0%
during an act of terrorism but there
 
03:31:01.110 --> 03:31:01.120 align:start position:0%
were at vigils and peaceful marches i
 
03:31:02.950 --> 03:31:02.960 align:start position:0%
don't want to destroy new hampshire i
 
03:31:04.550 --> 03:31:04.560 align:start position:0%
want to be on a path for new hampshire
 
03:31:07.830 --> 03:31:07.840 align:start position:0%
to be better starting with this bill and
 
03:31:10.389 --> 03:31:10.399 align:start position:0%
i also just wanted to add because no one
 
03:31:11.830 --> 03:31:11.840 align:start position:0%
else had mentioned it that rubber
 
03:31:13.510 --> 03:31:13.520 align:start position:0%
bullets the ones that we've been seeing
 
03:31:16.070 --> 03:31:16.080 align:start position:0%
use on the news are meant to be shot at
 
03:31:18.710 --> 03:31:18.720 align:start position:0%
the ground and to hit someone after
 
03:31:20.870 --> 03:31:20.880 align:start position:0%
they've been hit from the ground
 
03:31:22.870 --> 03:31:22.880 align:start position:0%
they're not supposed to be directly shot
 
03:31:26.150 --> 03:31:26.160 align:start position:0%
at people because that is as harmful
 
03:31:28.469 --> 03:31:28.479 align:start position:0%
almost as harmful as just a regular
 
03:31:28.479 --> 03:31:29.510 align:start position:0%
almost as harmful as just a regular
bullet

03:31:29.510 --> 03:31:29.520 align:start position:0%
bullet
 
03:31:31.510 --> 03:31:31.520 align:start position:0%
um i'm happy to take questions if you
 
03:31:36.389 --> 03:31:36.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:41.030 --> 03:31:41.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:42.630 --> 03:31:42.640 align:start position:0%
seeing no hands raised
 
03:31:47.190 --> 03:31:47.200 align:start position:0%

munitions cs gas
 
03:32:52.710 --> 03:32:52.720 align:start position:0%
over the century civilizations have
 
03:32:54.389 --> 03:32:54.399 align:start position:0%
sought ways to protect society from

violence while minimizing injuries to

specialized training which certifies
 
03:33:05.429 --> 03:33:05.439 align:start position:0%
them in the safe deployment of less

lethal impact munitions and chemical
 
03:33:09.349 --> 03:33:09.359 align:start position:0%
munitions this training provides
 
03:33:11.910 --> 03:33:11.920 align:start position:0%
officers with various ways to maintain

order while also earning the public's

a peaceful resolution
 
03:33:46.790 --> 03:33:46.800 align:start position:0%
chemical munitions are a tool utilized
 
03:33:49.190 --> 03:33:49.200 align:start position:0%
to de-escalate volatile situations by
 
03:33:51.590 --> 03:33:51.600 align:start position:0%
safely removing an individual with

that are deployed in order to apprehend
 
03:34:04.309 --> 03:34:04.319 align:start position:0%
dangerous individuals and decrease the

chance of injury or death to suspects
 
03:34:09.269 --> 03:34:09.279 align:start position:0%
bystanders and officers they provide a

transfer of kinetic energy from the
 
03:34:13.190 --> 03:34:13.200 align:start position:0%
device to the individual with the
 
03:34:15.349 --> 03:34:15.359 align:start position:0%
desired effect being a temporary pain
 
03:34:17.269 --> 03:34:17.279 align:start position:0%
stimulus that interrupts their thought

process in order to bring about a change
 
03:34:20.630 --> 03:34:20.640 align:start position:0%
in behavior
 
03:34:22.950 --> 03:34:22.960 align:start position:0%
manufacturers have tested these prod
 
03:34:25.190 --> 03:34:25.200 align:start position:0%
these products endlessly to ensure that
 
03:34:27.670 --> 03:34:27.680 align:start position:0%
they're only using enough kinetic energy
 
03:34:29.910 --> 03:34:29.920 align:start position:0%
to simply gain compliance
 
03:34:31.670 --> 03:34:31.680 align:start position:0%
is imperative to provide officers with
 
03:34:35.349 --> 03:34:35.359 align:start position:0%
the viable methods of subdue
 
03:34:35.359 --> 03:34:36.309 align:start position:0%
the viable methods of subdue

sergeant
 
03:34:38.309 --> 03:34:38.319 align:start position:0%
we do have to limit testimony to members
 
03:34:40.309 --> 03:34:40.319 align:start position:0%
public to two minutes so i just would
 
03:34:42.630 --> 03:34:42.640 align:start position:0%
ask if you find uh including the
 
03:34:42.640 --> 03:35:03.349 align:start position:0%
ask if you find uh including the
testimony

03:35:03.349 --> 03:35:03.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:03.359 --> 03:35:05.349 align:start position:0%
 
yes

03:35:05.349 --> 03:35:05.359 align:start position:0%
yes
 
03:35:06.550 --> 03:35:06.560 align:start position:0%
sorry about that
 
03:35:08.389 --> 03:35:08.399 align:start position:0%
um get back to where i was saying if
 
03:35:11.030 --> 03:35:11.040 align:start position:0%
hospital 564 were to pass officers would
 
03:35:12.710 --> 03:35:12.720 align:start position:0%
not have these options and would be
 
03:35:14.550 --> 03:35:14.560 align:start position:0%
forced to decide whether to subject
 
03:35:16.469 --> 03:35:16.479 align:start position:0%
themselves to potential injury by
 
03:35:19.030 --> 03:35:19.040 align:start position:0%
physical confrontation or utilize lethal
 
03:35:20.950 --> 03:35:20.960 align:start position:0%
force as seen in the u.s capitol
 
03:35:22.710 --> 03:35:22.720 align:start position:0%
building riots that sergeant lang

building riots that sergeant lang
discussed

03:35:24.229 --> 03:35:24.239 align:start position:0%
discussed
 
03:35:25.830 --> 03:35:25.840 align:start position:0%
by removing these options you are
 
03:35:27.910 --> 03:35:27.920 align:start position:0%
inherently increasing the risk to the
 
03:35:29.990 --> 03:35:30.000 align:start position:0%
general public police officers and
 
03:35:30.000 --> 03:35:32.070 align:start position:0%
general public police officers and
suspects

03:35:32.070 --> 03:35:32.080 align:start position:0%
suspects
 
03:35:33.429 --> 03:35:33.439 align:start position:0%
thank you sergeant we do have to limit
 
03:35:36.229 --> 03:35:36.239 align:start position:0%
testimony to two minutes per per witness
 
03:35:37.830 --> 03:35:37.840 align:start position:0%
and i believe the art you've exceeded
 
03:35:40.150 --> 03:35:40.160 align:start position:0%
that time by about 30 seconds we do
 
03:35:41.990 --> 03:35:42.000 align:start position:0%
um me no disrespect to
 
03:35:42.000 --> 03:35:42.870 align:start position:0%
um me no disrespect to
um

03:35:42.870 --> 03:35:42.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:35:44.229 --> 03:35:44.239 align:start position:0%
interrupting but we do have to move on
 
03:35:46.389 --> 03:35:46.399 align:start position:0%
to the next way this and fairness
 
03:35:50.229 --> 03:35:50.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:52.469 --> 03:35:52.479 align:start position:0%
representative hopper uh yeah thank you
 
03:35:55.030 --> 03:35:55.040 align:start position:0%
mr chair thank you uh for uh sergeant
 
03:35:56.870 --> 03:35:56.880 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
 
03:35:59.110 --> 03:35:59.120 align:start position:0%
if in some of the cases around the
 
03:36:01.190 --> 03:36:01.200 align:start position:0%
united states because it seems like
 
03:36:02.630 --> 03:36:02.640 align:start position:0%
we're really not talking about new
 
03:36:03.990 --> 03:36:04.000 align:start position:0%
hampshire today
 
03:36:06.550 --> 03:36:06.560 align:start position:0%
i have seen uh frozen water bottles
 
03:36:09.349 --> 03:36:09.359 align:start position:0%
thrown at police bricks thrown at police
 
03:36:12.710 --> 03:36:12.720 align:start position:0%
uh molotov cocktail stronger police
 
03:36:14.790 --> 03:36:14.800 align:start position:0%
what non-lethal
 
03:36:16.790 --> 03:36:16.800 align:start position:0%
uh remedy would they have to try to
 
03:36:18.150 --> 03:36:18.160 align:start position:0%
control those
 
03:36:19.590 --> 03:36:19.600 align:start position:0%
crowds that are
 
03:36:21.030 --> 03:36:21.040 align:start position:0%
you know um
 
03:36:23.429 --> 03:36:23.439 align:start position:0%
attacking them if we if we
 
03:36:40.630 --> 03:36:40.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:41.910 --> 03:36:41.920 align:start position:0%
can you hear me
 
03:36:41.920 --> 03:36:44.229 align:start position:0%
can you hear me
yes

03:36:44.229 --> 03:36:44.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:46.150 --> 03:36:46.160 align:start position:0%
no i agree with you 100 on that the
 
03:36:48.150 --> 03:36:48.160 align:start position:0%
individuals that are in favor of this
 
03:36:49.429 --> 03:36:49.439 align:start position:0%
house bill
 
03:36:50.950 --> 03:36:50.960 align:start position:0%
i think they need to educate themselves
 
03:36:52.790 --> 03:36:52.800 align:start position:0%
a little bit on what less lethal
 
03:36:54.150 --> 03:36:54.160 align:start position:0%
munitions are
 
03:36:56.550 --> 03:36:56.560 align:start position:0%
um in the effectiveness it has and what
 
03:36:58.309 --> 03:36:58.319 align:start position:0%
else what are the tools the police
 
03:37:00.710 --> 03:37:00.720 align:start position:0%
department have to protect the community
 
03:37:04.150 --> 03:37:04.160 align:start position:0%
and the officers at these situations
 
03:37:08.469 --> 03:37:08.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:12.710 --> 03:37:12.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:12.720 --> 03:37:14.389 align:start position:0%
 
representative

03:37:14.389 --> 03:37:14.399 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:37:14.399 --> 03:37:16.309 align:start position:0%
representative
representatives

03:37:16.309 --> 03:37:16.319 align:start position:0%
representatives
 
03:37:18.389 --> 03:37:18.399 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
03:37:21.830 --> 03:37:21.840 align:start position:0%
my question is whether or not officers
 
03:37:25.110 --> 03:37:25.120 align:start position:0%
carry weapons like tear gas uh and
 
03:37:28.309 --> 03:37:28.319 align:start position:0%
rubber bullets uh as a matter of course
 
03:37:30.389 --> 03:37:30.399 align:start position:0%
or if these are weapons
 
03:37:32.150 --> 03:37:32.160 align:start position:0%
uh that are only
 
03:37:32.160 --> 03:37:33.990 align:start position:0%
uh that are only
uh

03:37:33.990 --> 03:37:34.000 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:37:38.790 --> 03:37:38.800 align:start position:0%
provided or used uh in situations like
 
03:37:38.800 --> 03:37:39.750 align:start position:0%
provided or used uh in situations like
um

03:37:39.750 --> 03:37:39.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:37:39.760 --> 03:37:40.870 align:start position:0%
um
uh

03:37:40.870 --> 03:37:40.880 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:37:43.269 --> 03:37:43.279 align:start position:0%
public protests yeah you mentioned that
 
03:37:45.590 --> 03:37:45.600 align:start position:0%
there are situations where you may have
 
03:37:47.590 --> 03:37:47.600 align:start position:0%
some people in a building that you may
 
03:37:49.269 --> 03:37:49.279 align:start position:0%
want to evacuate
 
03:37:53.190 --> 03:37:53.200 align:start position:0%
um i'm just curious uh how special
 
03:37:55.190 --> 03:37:55.200 align:start position:0%
these weapons are in the course of a
 
03:38:11.510 --> 03:38:11.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:13.030 --> 03:38:13.040 align:start position:0%
that's why i make drama muted can you
 
03:38:13.990 --> 03:38:14.000 align:start position:0%
hear me
 
03:38:15.910 --> 03:38:15.920 align:start position:0%
yes yes
 
03:38:17.830 --> 03:38:17.840 align:start position:0%
the typical officer does not have access
 
03:38:19.830 --> 03:38:19.840 align:start position:0%
to these uh to these munitions that we
 
03:38:21.429 --> 03:38:21.439 align:start position:0%
speak of here today
 
03:38:24.309 --> 03:38:24.319 align:start position:0%
these munitions are usually utilized um
 
03:38:26.630 --> 03:38:26.640 align:start position:0%
after uh safe considerations and
 
03:38:28.309 --> 03:38:28.319 align:start position:0%
detailed operation plans have been
 
03:38:31.269 --> 03:38:31.279 align:start position:0%
deployed um the testimony that you heard
 
03:38:33.990 --> 03:38:34.000 align:start position:0%
here before us earlier um they indicate
 
03:38:35.990 --> 03:38:36.000 align:start position:0%
that they're concerned about officers
 
03:38:37.750 --> 03:38:37.760 align:start position:0%
deploying these rounds blindly into
 
03:38:39.590 --> 03:38:39.600 align:start position:0%
crowds which is not the case and it's
 
03:38:42.070 --> 03:38:42.080 align:start position:0%
not near the training that's received
 
03:38:43.830 --> 03:38:43.840 align:start position:0%
here in the state of new hampshire
 
03:38:46.710 --> 03:38:46.720 align:start position:0%
uh these uh these these tools that the
 
03:38:49.670 --> 03:38:49.680 align:start position:0%
officers have um are not utilized on a
 
03:38:51.510 --> 03:38:51.520 align:start position:0%
day-to-day basis um here in new
 
03:38:53.750 --> 03:38:53.760 align:start position:0%
hampshire um they are used only for
 
03:38:53.760 --> 03:38:54.790 align:start position:0%
hampshire um they are used only for
specific

03:38:54.790 --> 03:38:54.800 align:start position:0%
specific
 
03:39:01.910 --> 03:39:01.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:01.920 --> 03:39:04.710 align:start position:0%
 
representative

03:39:04.710 --> 03:39:04.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:06.229 --> 03:39:06.239 align:start position:0%
in terms of the training that you
 
03:39:08.469 --> 03:39:08.479 align:start position:0%
receive you you said that you received
 
03:39:10.389 --> 03:39:10.399 align:start position:0%
training in the use of these these
 
03:39:13.030 --> 03:39:13.040 align:start position:0%
weapons that you actually call editions
 
03:39:15.510 --> 03:39:15.520 align:start position:0%
which has more of a military context
 
03:39:19.349 --> 03:39:19.359 align:start position:0%
than a public police uh policing context
 
03:39:24.389 --> 03:39:24.399 align:start position:0%
uh but i'm curious to what extent uh
 
03:39:26.150 --> 03:39:26.160 align:start position:0%
if you had to weigh the amount of
 
03:39:29.030 --> 03:39:29.040 align:start position:0%
training that you received uh in the use
 
03:39:30.389 --> 03:39:30.399 align:start position:0%
of these weapons
 
03:39:33.429 --> 03:39:33.439 align:start position:0%
uh in these types of situations versus
 
03:39:35.830 --> 03:39:35.840 align:start position:0%
the amount of training that you receive
 
03:39:35.840 --> 03:39:36.630 align:start position:0%
the amount of training that you receive
in

03:39:36.630 --> 03:39:36.640 align:start position:0%
in
 
03:39:41.269 --> 03:39:41.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:42.870 --> 03:39:42.880 align:start position:0%
where do things lie
 
03:39:47.110 --> 03:39:47.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:49.429 --> 03:39:49.439 align:start position:0%
yes sir it's about the same
 
03:39:51.670 --> 03:39:51.680 align:start position:0%
like i said before i would love for uh
 
03:39:53.510 --> 03:39:53.520 align:start position:0%
any uh individual of the community to
 
03:39:55.910 --> 03:39:55.920 align:start position:0%
come join us during one of these events
 
03:39:58.950 --> 03:39:58.960 align:start position:0%
um and see the uh the planning that goes
 
03:39:59.990 --> 03:40:00.000 align:start position:0%
into these
 
03:40:00.000 --> 03:40:01.190 align:start position:0%
into these
um

03:40:01.190 --> 03:40:01.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:40:03.830 --> 03:40:03.840 align:start position:0%
we do not plan or nor do we want to use
 
03:40:06.870 --> 03:40:06.880 align:start position:0%
any of these munitions or these tools
 
03:40:10.309 --> 03:40:10.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:12.229 --> 03:40:12.239 align:start position:0%
our ultimate goal is a peaceful is a
 
03:40:14.469 --> 03:40:14.479 align:start position:0%
peaceful resolution to everything
 
03:40:14.479 --> 03:40:15.830 align:start position:0%
peaceful resolution to everything
unfortunately

03:40:15.830 --> 03:40:15.840 align:start position:0%
unfortunately
 
03:40:17.990 --> 03:40:18.000 align:start position:0%
there are incidents that occur that
 
03:40:20.790 --> 03:40:20.800 align:start position:0%
result in the use of these tools in
 
03:40:22.870 --> 03:40:22.880 align:start position:0%
order for the police to properly do
 
03:40:24.150 --> 03:40:24.160 align:start position:0%
their job
 
03:40:25.990 --> 03:40:26.000 align:start position:0%
to protect themselves the community and
 
03:40:27.910 --> 03:40:27.920 align:start position:0%
the people that are present at these
 
03:40:27.920 --> 03:40:28.950 align:start position:0%
the people that are present at these
events

03:40:28.950 --> 03:40:28.960 align:start position:0%
events
 
03:40:28.960 --> 03:40:30.469 align:start position:0%
events
or

03:40:30.469 --> 03:40:30.479 align:start position:0%
or
 
03:40:32.389 --> 03:40:32.399 align:start position:0%
they're not just used at events i love
 
03:40:34.070 --> 03:40:34.080 align:start position:0%
everybody keeps on talking about how
 
03:40:37.269 --> 03:40:37.279 align:start position:0%
these are used at protests um you need
 
03:40:39.349 --> 03:40:39.359 align:start position:0%
to understand that these in state of new
 
03:40:40.870 --> 03:40:40.880 align:start position:0%
hampshire um
 
03:40:42.309 --> 03:40:42.319 align:start position:0%
i can't remember the last time they were
 
03:40:45.349 --> 03:40:45.359 align:start position:0%
actually used during an event um
 
03:40:47.269 --> 03:40:47.279 align:start position:0%
or a protest
 
03:40:49.030 --> 03:40:49.040 align:start position:0%
the majority of these tools that are
 
03:40:51.750 --> 03:40:51.760 align:start position:0%
used are used for barricaded subjects
 
03:40:53.349 --> 03:40:53.359 align:start position:0%
here in new hampshire
 
03:40:53.359 --> 03:40:54.550 align:start position:0%
here in new hampshire
um

03:40:54.550 --> 03:40:54.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:40:56.630 --> 03:40:56.640 align:start position:0%
and obviously this bill pertains to new
 
03:40:56.640 --> 03:40:57.590 align:start position:0%
and obviously this bill pertains to new
hampshire

03:40:57.590 --> 03:40:57.600 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
03:40:59.190 --> 03:40:59.200 align:start position:0%
itself we're not looking
 
03:41:01.429 --> 03:41:01.439 align:start position:0%
across the uh across the nation at this
 
03:41:01.439 --> 03:41:11.030 align:start position:0%
across the uh across the nation at this
time

03:41:11.030 --> 03:41:11.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:14.550 --> 03:41:14.560 align:start position:0%
representative newman
 
03:41:17.190 --> 03:41:17.200 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you sergeant
 
03:41:18.870 --> 03:41:18.880 align:start position:0%
um if this
 
03:41:21.990 --> 03:41:22.000 align:start position:0%
in your opinion if this bill was somehow
 
03:41:22.000 --> 03:41:23.190 align:start position:0%
in your opinion if this bill was somehow
limited

03:41:23.190 --> 03:41:23.200 align:start position:0%
limited
 
03:41:26.469 --> 03:41:26.479 align:start position:0%
to uh prohibit the use of these
 
03:41:26.479 --> 03:41:27.590 align:start position:0%
to uh prohibit the use of these
items

03:41:27.590 --> 03:41:27.600 align:start position:0%
items
 
03:41:30.790 --> 03:41:30.800 align:start position:0%
at only uh events and things like that
 
03:41:32.870 --> 03:41:32.880 align:start position:0%
for crowd control
 
03:41:35.110 --> 03:41:35.120 align:start position:0%
and the restriction not apply to the
 
03:41:37.510 --> 03:41:37.520 align:start position:0%
other uses that police have for
 
03:41:40.070 --> 03:41:40.080 align:start position:0%
like getting a suspect out of a house
 
03:41:43.349 --> 03:41:43.359 align:start position:0%
would that make the mo that make bill
 
03:41:48.150 --> 03:41:48.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:49.990 --> 03:41:50.000 align:start position:0%
no i still would disagree with the bill
 
03:41:52.550 --> 03:41:52.560 align:start position:0%
when i would be opposed to it
 
03:41:54.070 --> 03:41:54.080 align:start position:0%
these tools have been proven to be
 
03:41:54.080 --> 03:41:55.750 align:start position:0%
these tools have been proven to be
effective

03:41:55.750 --> 03:41:55.760 align:start position:0%
effective
 
03:41:58.070 --> 03:41:58.080 align:start position:0%
and safe to use as liners are used
 
03:41:58.080 --> 03:41:59.349 align:start position:0%
and safe to use as liners are used
appropriately

03:41:59.349 --> 03:41:59.359 align:start position:0%
appropriately
 
03:42:00.950 --> 03:42:00.960 align:start position:0%
if you take these tools away from the
 
03:42:03.429 --> 03:42:03.439 align:start position:0%
police here in new hampshire
 
03:42:05.750 --> 03:42:05.760 align:start position:0%
unfortunately my testimony was cut short
 
03:42:07.990 --> 03:42:08.000 align:start position:0%
but i was trying to explain during my
 
03:42:12.150 --> 03:42:12.160 align:start position:0%
testimony what less lethal force is
 
03:42:14.150 --> 03:42:14.160 align:start position:0%
and what lethal force is and people need
 
03:42:15.590 --> 03:42:15.600 align:start position:0%
to understand that if you take these
 
03:42:17.590 --> 03:42:17.600 align:start position:0%
tools away from the police
 
03:42:19.750 --> 03:42:19.760 align:start position:0%
i know that the earlier testimony people
 
03:42:23.190 --> 03:42:23.200 align:start position:0%
talked about shields and batons

ward one in nashua um
 
04:27:10.229 --> 04:27:10.239 align:start position:0%
when the country erupted because of the
 
04:27:11.990 --> 04:27:12.000 align:start position:0%
murder of black citizens by a few
 
04:27:13.910 --> 04:27:13.920 align:start position:0%
corrupt police the citizens of nashua
 
04:27:15.750 --> 04:27:15.760 align:start position:0%
were worried on the news they could see
 
04:27:18.309 --> 04:27:18.319 align:start position:0%
people like themselves in those who were
 
04:27:20.630 --> 04:27:20.640 align:start position:0%
being killed they also saw stickers on
 
04:27:23.349 --> 04:27:23.359 align:start position:0%
telephone poles here in nashua of white
 
04:27:25.429 --> 04:27:25.439 align:start position:0%
supremacists inviting people to join and
 
04:27:28.149 --> 04:27:28.159 align:start position:0%
families were rightfully terrified that
 
04:27:30.149 --> 04:27:30.159 align:start position:0%
was when the nashua conversation on race
 
04:27:32.149 --> 04:27:32.159 align:start position:0%
and justice was formed and this group
 
04:27:33.750 --> 04:27:33.760 align:start position:0%
continues to this day offering our
 
04:27:35.670 --> 04:27:35.680 align:start position:0%
community an opportunity to discuss with
 
04:27:37.990 --> 04:27:38.000 align:start position:0%
the police chief and his officers issues
 
04:27:40.149 --> 04:27:40.159 align:start position:0%
that we believe are racially biased
 
04:27:41.910 --> 04:27:41.920 align:start position:0%
nashua's police are nationally
 
04:27:45.110 --> 04:27:45.120 align:start position:0%
accredited and um go through a rigorous
 
04:27:45.120 --> 04:27:45.830 align:start position:0%
accredited and um go through a rigorous
uh

04:27:45.830 --> 04:27:45.840 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:27:45.840 --> 04:27:46.950 align:start position:0%
uh
test

04:27:46.950 --> 04:27:46.960 align:start position:0%
test
 
04:27:50.070 --> 04:27:50.080 align:start position:0%
to be reaccredited each year um and
 
04:27:51.910 --> 04:27:51.920 align:start position:0%
they're also full members of the nashua
 
04:27:54.070 --> 04:27:54.080 align:start position:0%
conversation of race and justice and
 
04:27:55.590 --> 04:27:55.600 align:start position:0%
this bill has nothing to do with those
 
04:27:58.309 --> 04:27:58.319 align:start position:0%
good people but just like much of what
 
04:28:01.030 --> 04:28:01.040 align:start position:0%
new hampshire does the country follows
 
04:28:02.950 --> 04:28:02.960 align:start position:0%
this bill as amended should be part of
 
04:28:05.429 --> 04:28:05.439 align:start position:0%
any police department's manuals peaceful
 
04:28:07.189 --> 04:28:07.199 align:start position:0%
protests need to be protected by the
 
04:28:09.590 --> 04:28:09.600 align:start position:0%
police as they have been in nashua and
 
04:28:11.590 --> 04:28:11.600 align:start position:0%
when a few people do something that
 
04:28:13.269 --> 04:28:13.279 align:start position:0%
needs to be stopped the rest of the
 
04:28:15.349 --> 04:28:15.359 align:start position:0%
people should be kept safe
 
04:28:17.030 --> 04:28:17.040 align:start position:0%
passing this into law would send a
 
04:28:18.710 --> 04:28:18.720 align:start position:0%
message to the rest of the country and
 
04:28:20.710 --> 04:28:20.720 align:start position:0%
all of the good people in new hampshire
 
04:28:22.309 --> 04:28:22.319 align:start position:0%
the pepper spraying a person kneeling
 
04:28:24.309 --> 04:28:24.319 align:start position:0%
with their hands behind their head among
 
04:28:26.149 --> 04:28:26.159 align:start position:0%

04:28:41.910 --> 04:28:41.920 align:start position:0%

question
certainly

04:29:09.750 --> 04:29:09.760 align:start position:0%

04:29:11.030 --> 04:29:11.040 align:start position:0%
quickly
 
04:29:16.070 --> 04:29:16.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:17.910 --> 04:29:17.920 align:start position:0%
an unobserved citizen would be somebody
 
04:29:19.910 --> 04:29:19.920 align:start position:0%
who's standing there and not holding
 
04:29:24.309 --> 04:29:24.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:26.309 --> 04:29:26.319 align:start position:0%

representative

04:29:28.070 --> 04:29:28.080 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:29:29.030 --> 04:29:29.040 align:start position:0%
if you just raise your hand you don't
 
04:29:32.309 --> 04:29:32.319 align:start position:0%
need to say say fall
 
04:29:32.319 --> 04:29:34.469 align:start position:0%
need to say say fall
so

04:29:34.469 --> 04:29:34.479 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:29:35.750 --> 04:29:35.760 align:start position:0%
it only
 
04:29:37.110 --> 04:29:37.120 align:start position:0%
holds true if
 
04:29:38.710 --> 04:29:38.720 align:start position:0%
they have something that would kill
 
04:29:42.550 --> 04:29:42.560 align:start position:0%
another person or would just injured
 
04:29:44.550 --> 04:29:44.560 align:start position:0%
i mean like a bottle of water i honestly
 
04:29:46.229 --> 04:29:46.239 align:start position:0%
don't know i'm sure the police would see
 
04:29:48.550 --> 04:29:48.560 align:start position:0%
a bottle of water thrown at them as as
 
04:29:50.149 --> 04:29:50.159 align:start position:0%
something that is not intentional to
 
04:29:51.429 --> 04:29:51.439 align:start position:0%
hurt them
 
04:29:53.349 --> 04:29:53.359 align:start position:0%
that's that's just not something that
 
04:29:53.359 --> 04:29:54.070 align:start position:0%
that's that's just not something that
can

04:29:54.070 --> 04:29:54.080 align:start position:0%
can
 
04:29:58.790 --> 04:29:58.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:01.110 --> 04:30:01.120 align:start position:0%
so i've seen
 
04:30:03.269 --> 04:30:03.279 align:start position:0%
pictures of people
 
04:30:03.279 --> 04:30:04.149 align:start position:0%
pictures of people
uh

04:30:04.149 --> 04:30:04.159 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:30:06.229 --> 04:30:06.239 align:start position:0%
carrying skateboards that seems to be
 
04:30:07.990 --> 04:30:08.000 align:start position:0%
the weapon of choice
 
04:30:11.830 --> 04:30:11.840 align:start position:0%
so would that be an armed person
 
04:30:13.349 --> 04:30:13.359 align:start position:0%
it depends on the situation are they
 
04:30:15.349 --> 04:30:15.359 align:start position:0%
holding it up over their head yes they
 
04:30:17.510 --> 04:30:17.520 align:start position:0%
are armed if they're rolling on it on
 
04:30:19.990 --> 04:30:20.000 align:start position:0%
the road no
 
04:30:21.110 --> 04:30:21.120 align:start position:0%

04:32:11.840 --> 04:32:17.110 align:start position:0%
yes briefly thank you
um

04:32:17.110 --> 04:32:17.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:19.030 --> 04:32:19.040 align:start position:0%
pass with two sides of this
 
04:32:20.630 --> 04:32:20.640 align:start position:0%
we have to we have to
 
04:32:23.110 --> 04:32:23.120 align:start position:0%
make sure that our law enforcement have
 
04:32:24.790 --> 04:32:24.800 align:start position:0%
the tools that they need to be able to
 
04:32:27.110 --> 04:32:27.120 align:start position:0%
maintain uh order on the streets of our
 
04:32:28.550 --> 04:32:28.560 align:start position:0%
civil society
 
04:32:28.560 --> 04:32:30.550 align:start position:0%
civil society
uh

04:32:30.550 --> 04:32:30.560 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:32:33.429 --> 04:32:33.439 align:start position:0%
it's apparent that repealing
 
04:32:36.550 --> 04:32:36.560 align:start position:0%
rsa 627 colon 5 part 8
 
04:32:38.309 --> 04:32:38.319 align:start position:0%
would seriously impact their ability to
 
04:32:40.389 --> 04:32:40.399 align:start position:0%
do their jobs effectively so
 
04:32:41.830 --> 04:32:41.840 align:start position:0%
based upon that
 
04:32:48.229 --> 04:32:48.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:50.389 --> 04:32:50.399 align:start position:0%
more it doesn't really solve the problem
 
04:32:51.910 --> 04:32:51.920 align:start position:0%
here in new hampshire than
 
04:32:54.469 --> 04:32:54.479 align:start position:0%
presently or historically according to
 
04:33:00.149 --> 04:33:00.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:02.790 --> 04:33:02.800 align:start position:0%
the chair will open this uh open the
 
04:33:04.709 --> 04:33:04.719 align:start position:0%
question for discussion
 
04:33:09.590 --> 04:33:09.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:12.390 --> 04:33:12.400 align:start position:0%
representative gathered
 
04:33:14.390 --> 04:33:14.400 align:start position:0%
when i first got this bill when i read
 
04:33:14.400 --> 04:33:15.269 align:start position:0%
when i first got this bill when i read
it

04:33:15.269 --> 04:33:15.279 align:start position:0%
it
 
04:33:19.590 --> 04:33:19.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:21.029 --> 04:33:21.039 align:start position:0%
my colleague did
 
04:33:22.789 --> 04:33:22.799 align:start position:0%
however i really
 
04:33:24.310 --> 04:33:24.320 align:start position:0%
dug into it
 
04:33:27.990 --> 04:33:28.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:28.000 --> 04:33:28.830 align:start position:0%
 
the

04:33:28.830 --> 04:33:28.840 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:33:28.840 --> 04:33:30.629 align:start position:0%
the
term

04:33:30.629 --> 04:33:30.639 align:start position:0%
term
 
04:33:30.639 --> 04:33:32.789 align:start position:0%
term
effect

04:33:32.789 --> 04:33:32.799 align:start position:0%
effect
 
04:33:34.470 --> 04:33:34.480 align:start position:0%
is truly not necessary
 
04:33:34.480 --> 04:33:35.670 align:start position:0%
is truly not necessary
because

04:33:35.670 --> 04:33:35.680 align:start position:0%
because
 
04:33:39.510 --> 04:33:39.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:39.520 --> 04:33:40.709 align:start position:0%
 
eliminate

04:33:40.709 --> 04:33:40.719 align:start position:0%
eliminate
 
04:33:42.310 --> 04:33:42.320 align:start position:0%
what uh
 
04:33:43.830 --> 04:33:43.840 align:start position:0%
the sponsors have put in here to
 
04:33:43.840 --> 04:33:44.869 align:start position:0%
the sponsors have put in here to
eliminate

04:33:44.869 --> 04:33:44.879 align:start position:0%
eliminate
 
04:33:48.789 --> 04:33:48.799 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:51.029 --> 04:33:51.039 align:start position:0%
you still have the same tone as to what
 
04:33:53.670 --> 04:33:53.680 align:start position:0%
what the person is trying to say here
 
04:33:57.109 --> 04:33:57.119 align:start position:0%
so for me i can read this i'll just read
 
04:33:59.429 --> 04:33:59.439 align:start position:0%
uh the one let's say b
 
04:34:02.310 --> 04:34:02.320 align:start position:0%
on the on the roman rule 2
 
04:34:04.470 --> 04:34:04.480 align:start position:0%
to prevent the escape from custody of a
 
04:34:06.150 --> 04:34:06.160 align:start position:0%
person whom
 
04:34:10.949 --> 04:34:10.959 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:13.910 --> 04:34:13.920 align:start position:0%
so for me and i think when this was put
 
04:34:13.920 --> 04:34:14.709 align:start position:0%
so for me and i think when this was put
here

04:34:14.709 --> 04:34:14.719 align:start position:0%
here
 
04:34:18.470 --> 04:34:18.480 align:start position:0%
it i really struggled with it before
 
04:34:20.551 --> 04:34:20.561 align:start position:0%
why do you need effect
 
04:34:22.709 --> 04:34:22.719 align:start position:0%
or any of that
 
04:34:25.510 --> 04:34:25.520 align:start position:0%
what's the purpose and to and i have not
 
04:34:27.590 --> 04:34:27.600 align:start position:0%
seen where anyone has
 
04:34:27.600 --> 04:34:28.629 align:start position:0%
seen where anyone has
actually

04:34:28.629 --> 04:34:28.639 align:start position:0%
actually
 
04:34:31.830 --> 04:34:31.840 align:start position:0%
told me that effect is more important
 
04:34:34.949 --> 04:34:34.959 align:start position:0%
than not having a bear
 
04:34:37.029 --> 04:34:37.039 align:start position:0%
i don't think that that that verb
 
04:34:39.189 --> 04:34:39.199 align:start position:0%
generates anything other than even if it
 
04:34:40.551 --> 04:34:40.561 align:start position:0%
wasn't bigger it would make a difference
 
04:34:43.670 --> 04:34:43.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:43.680 --> 04:34:44.949 align:start position:0%
 
so

04:34:44.949 --> 04:34:44.959 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:34:45.830 --> 04:34:45.840 align:start position:0%
for me
 
04:34:48.551 --> 04:34:48.561 align:start position:0%
it's a cleanup deal
 
04:34:50.230 --> 04:34:50.240 align:start position:0%
and i don't think it's necessary that we
 
04:34:58.150 --> 04:34:58.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:01.189 --> 04:35:01.199 align:start position:0%
so i do not agree with the bmi ipl as
 
04:35:01.199 --> 04:35:05.029 align:start position:0%
so i do not agree with the bmi ipl as
well

04:35:05.029 --> 04:35:05.039 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:07.830 --> 04:35:07.840 align:start position:0%
representative muse
 
04:35:07.840 --> 04:35:09.510 align:start position:0%
representative muse
hughes

04:35:09.510 --> 04:35:09.520 align:start position:0%
hughes
 
04:35:11.750 --> 04:35:11.760 align:start position:0%
yes thank you um this is a bill that
 
04:35:14.709 --> 04:35:14.719 align:start position:0%
actually came before us in some form uh
 
04:35:16.869 --> 04:35:16.879 align:start position:0%
last year and i think last year a lot of
 
04:35:19.670 --> 04:35:19.680 align:start position:0%
us were confused by it i think there was
 
04:35:21.990 --> 04:35:22.000 align:start position:0%
a lot of confusion around exactly what
 
04:35:23.990 --> 04:35:24.000 align:start position:0%
an effect what affecting an arrest is
 
04:35:24.000 --> 04:35:24.789 align:start position:0%
an effect what affecting an arrest is
and

04:35:24.789 --> 04:35:24.799 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:35:25.990 --> 04:35:26.000 align:start position:0%
one of the things that i think was a
 
04:35:27.510 --> 04:35:27.520 align:start position:0%
good outcome of the hearing today is
 
04:35:29.109 --> 04:35:29.119 align:start position:0%
that we really had a chance to sort of
 
04:35:30.551 --> 04:35:30.561 align:start position:0%
drill into that
 
04:35:33.269 --> 04:35:33.279 align:start position:0%
and to understand uh understand that a
 
04:35:35.269 --> 04:35:35.279 align:start position:0%
little bit better
 
04:35:36.949 --> 04:35:36.959 align:start position:0%
but the thing that that really stuck
 
04:35:39.029 --> 04:35:39.039 align:start position:0%
with me in the end is
 
04:35:40.709 --> 04:35:40.719 align:start position:0%
you know the whole question of whether
 
04:35:43.429 --> 04:35:43.439 align:start position:0%
or not we
 
04:35:47.189 --> 04:35:47.199 align:start position:0%
we can value an arrest over over a human
 
04:35:47.199 --> 04:35:48.150 align:start position:0%
we can value an arrest over over a human
life

04:35:48.150 --> 04:35:48.160 align:start position:0%
life
 
04:35:48.160 --> 04:35:49.269 align:start position:0%
life
so

04:35:49.269 --> 04:35:49.279 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:35:51.269 --> 04:35:51.279 align:start position:0%
is it is it ever worth taking a human
 
04:35:53.429 --> 04:35:53.439 align:start position:0%
life in the in the course of of an
 
04:35:53.439 --> 04:35:54.551 align:start position:0%
life in the in the course of of an
arrest

04:35:54.551 --> 04:35:54.561 align:start position:0%
arrest
 
04:35:54.561 --> 04:35:55.269 align:start position:0%
arrest
and

04:35:55.269 --> 04:35:55.279 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:35:55.279 --> 04:35:57.670 align:start position:0%
and
um

04:35:57.670 --> 04:35:57.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:59.830 --> 04:35:59.840 align:start position:0%
especially when you have a choice to
 
04:36:01.510 --> 04:36:01.520 align:start position:0%
uh to
 
04:36:01.520 --> 04:36:02.470 align:start position:0%
uh to
uh

04:36:02.470 --> 04:36:02.480 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:36:04.629 --> 04:36:04.639 align:start position:0%
to let the person go or perhaps to use
 
04:36:08.070 --> 04:36:08.080 align:start position:0%
some sort of a um of a
 
04:36:09.910 --> 04:36:09.920 align:start position:0%
more reasonable measure
 
04:36:09.920 --> 04:36:10.869 align:start position:0%
more reasonable measure
um

04:36:10.869 --> 04:36:10.879 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:36:13.429 --> 04:36:13.439 align:start position:0%
i think one of the things that
 
04:36:14.709 --> 04:36:14.719 align:start position:0%
that a lot of
 
04:36:16.390 --> 04:36:16.400 align:start position:0%
a lot of people have been very disturbed
 
04:36:18.949 --> 04:36:18.959 align:start position:0%
by over the last few years is that with
 
04:36:21.750 --> 04:36:21.760 align:start position:0%
the increasing use of police body cams
 
04:36:23.670 --> 04:36:23.680 align:start position:0%
we we actually have seen
 
04:36:26.629 --> 04:36:26.639 align:start position:0%
quite a few incidents of where people uh
 
04:36:29.590 --> 04:36:29.600 align:start position:0%
where our officers in particular
 
04:36:33.830 --> 04:36:33.840 align:start position:0%
will shoot somebody fleeing in a rest
 
04:36:33.840 --> 04:36:35.269 align:start position:0%
will shoot somebody fleeing in a rest
and

04:36:35.269 --> 04:36:35.279 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:36:36.629 --> 04:36:36.639 align:start position:0%
and that person
 
04:36:37.750 --> 04:36:37.760 align:start position:0%
that person
 
04:36:39.670 --> 04:36:39.680 align:start position:0%
that person dies
 
04:36:39.680 --> 04:36:40.080 align:start position:0%
that person dies
so

04:36:40.080 --> 04:36:40.090 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:36:40.090 --> 04:36:41.189 align:start position:0%
so
[Music]

04:36:41.189 --> 04:36:41.199 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:36:43.189 --> 04:36:43.199 align:start position:0%
the bottom line is uh we don't have a
 
04:36:45.269 --> 04:36:45.279 align:start position:0%
death penalty in new hampshire
 
04:36:45.279 --> 04:36:46.470 align:start position:0%
death penalty in new hampshire
anymore

04:36:46.470 --> 04:36:46.480 align:start position:0%
anymore
 
04:36:49.670 --> 04:36:49.680 align:start position:0%
and when someone is fleeing in a way
 
04:36:51.750 --> 04:36:51.760 align:start position:0%
that um
 
04:36:55.189 --> 04:36:55.199 align:start position:0%
that isn't creating a specific threat
 
04:36:58.230 --> 04:36:58.240 align:start position:0%
for the officer involved
 
04:37:01.349 --> 04:37:01.359 align:start position:0%
it it does seem reasonable to me uh you
 
04:37:02.789 --> 04:37:02.799 align:start position:0%
know to uh
 
04:37:05.029 --> 04:37:05.039 align:start position:0%
to eliminate this this does not take
 
04:37:07.269 --> 04:37:07.279 align:start position:0%
away eliminating it would not take away
 
04:37:10.869 --> 04:37:10.879 align:start position:0%
the ability of an officer uh to defend
 
04:37:13.590 --> 04:37:13.600 align:start position:0%
himself or herself um if she was under
 
04:37:16.070 --> 04:37:16.080 align:start position:0%
you know he or she was under uh attacked
 
04:37:18.070 --> 04:37:18.080 align:start position:0%
by somebody who was threatening their
 
04:37:21.269 --> 04:37:21.279 align:start position:0%
life um but what it what it does seem to
 
04:37:21.279 --> 04:37:22.070 align:start position:0%
life um but what it what it does seem to
do

04:37:22.070 --> 04:37:22.080 align:start position:0%
do
 
04:37:23.910 --> 04:37:23.920 align:start position:0%
is to
 
04:37:25.590 --> 04:37:25.600 align:start position:0%
lower the possibility that we're going
 
04:37:27.109 --> 04:37:27.119 align:start position:0%
to have one of those incidents in new
 
04:37:29.670 --> 04:37:29.680 align:start position:0%
hampshire um that we're all going to
 
04:37:31.750 --> 04:37:31.760 align:start position:0%
regret and that we all
 
04:37:33.269 --> 04:37:33.279 align:start position:0%
should have or
 
04:37:34.470 --> 04:37:34.480 align:start position:0%
would be thinking later it would have
 
04:37:36.150 --> 04:37:36.160 align:start position:0%
been nice to have done something about
 
04:37:38.789 --> 04:37:38.799 align:start position:0%
that so to me this is an opportunity to
 
04:37:39.990 --> 04:37:40.000 align:start position:0%
maybe be
 
04:37:42.949 --> 04:37:42.959 align:start position:0%
a little more uh proactive and and i've
 
04:37:42.959 --> 04:37:44.070 align:start position:0%
a little more uh proactive and and i've
actually

04:37:44.070 --> 04:37:44.080 align:start position:0%
actually
 
04:37:46.070 --> 04:37:46.080 align:start position:0%
changed positions on this i think i
 
04:37:48.551 --> 04:37:48.561 align:start position:0%
think last year i i didn't see the the
 
04:37:50.629 --> 04:37:50.639 align:start position:0%
need for it or the use for it but the
 
04:37:51.910 --> 04:37:51.920 align:start position:0%
hearing today
 
04:37:54.709 --> 04:37:54.719 align:start position:0%
helped me understand uh why something
 
04:38:02.390 --> 04:38:02.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:05.429 --> 04:38:05.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:07.670 --> 04:38:07.680 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
04:38:10.470 --> 04:38:10.480 align:start position:0%
i too am confused about the uh
 
04:38:12.709 --> 04:38:12.719 align:start position:0%
the effect of an arrest
 
04:38:14.629 --> 04:38:14.639 align:start position:0%
but and i hear all this most of the
 
04:38:17.029 --> 04:38:17.039 align:start position:0%
commentary being about the
 
04:38:19.349 --> 04:38:19.359 align:start position:0%
the person trying to escape or trying to
 
04:38:19.359 --> 04:38:20.629 align:start position:0%
the person trying to escape or trying to
flee

04:38:20.629 --> 04:38:20.639 align:start position:0%
flee
 
04:38:20.639 --> 04:38:22.310 align:start position:0%
flee
and

04:38:22.310 --> 04:38:22.320 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:38:24.789 --> 04:38:24.799 align:start position:0%
i think i just can't find the line that
 
04:38:27.109 --> 04:38:27.119 align:start position:0%
delineates between affecting an arrest
 
04:38:29.189 --> 04:38:29.199 align:start position:0%
and and trying to flee
 
04:38:31.349 --> 04:38:31.359 align:start position:0%
and so i'm still pretty mu i haven't
 
04:38:32.949 --> 04:38:32.959 align:start position:0%
made up a decision my decision what i'm
 
04:38:34.310 --> 04:38:34.320 align:start position:0%
going to do but
 
04:38:38.150 --> 04:38:38.160 align:start position:0%
i am really confused by that
 
04:38:40.310 --> 04:38:40.320 align:start position:0%
so just to help help
 
04:38:41.750 --> 04:38:41.760 align:start position:0%
and understanding this is the way i
 
04:38:45.109 --> 04:38:45.119 align:start position:0%
interpret it and not always right but
 
04:38:45.119 --> 04:38:46.390 align:start position:0%
interpret it and not always right but
so

04:38:46.390 --> 04:38:46.400 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:38:47.349 --> 04:38:47.359 align:start position:0%
there is a
 
04:38:49.349 --> 04:38:49.359 align:start position:0%
if you're in custody you don't have to
 
04:38:51.349 --> 04:38:51.359 align:start position:0%
necessarily be arrested to be in custody
 
04:38:53.109 --> 04:38:53.119 align:start position:0%
but generally you can't you're not free
 
04:38:54.150 --> 04:38:54.160 align:start position:0%
to leave
 
04:38:55.590 --> 04:38:55.600 align:start position:0%
when you're in custody you can be in
 
04:38:56.789 --> 04:38:56.799 align:start position:0%
custody for more than one reason but if
 
04:38:58.310 --> 04:38:58.320 align:start position:0%
you are arrested
 
04:39:00.310 --> 04:39:00.320 align:start position:0%
you are most certainly in custody in
 
04:39:02.949 --> 04:39:02.959 align:start position:0%
that scenario
 
04:39:05.990 --> 04:39:06.000 align:start position:0%
what this says affecting the arrest is i
 
04:39:07.990 --> 04:39:08.000 align:start position:0%
always i interpret that as the officer
 
04:39:09.590 --> 04:39:09.600 align:start position:0%
is trying to arrest the person to bring
 
04:39:11.109 --> 04:39:11.119 align:start position:0%
them into custody
 
04:39:13.189 --> 04:39:13.199 align:start position:0%
so when it comes to the
 
04:39:15.910 --> 04:39:15.920 align:start position:0%
trying to escape language i'm reading
 
04:39:17.510 --> 04:39:17.520 align:start position:0%
that as
 
04:39:19.029 --> 04:39:19.039 align:start position:0%
they can be trying to escape whether
 
04:39:20.390 --> 04:39:20.400 align:start position:0%
they're in custody or they could be
 
04:39:22.629 --> 04:39:22.639 align:start position:0%
trying to escape to a you know evade
 
04:39:23.990 --> 04:39:24.000 align:start position:0%
being arrested
 
04:39:26.310 --> 04:39:26.320 align:start position:0%
i think if you can have hope the
 
04:39:28.150 --> 04:39:28.160 align:start position:0%
difference is
 
04:39:29.670 --> 04:39:29.680 align:start position:0%
this will allow
 
04:39:32.310 --> 04:39:32.320 align:start position:0%
still allow won't have any effect on a
 
04:39:34.470 --> 04:39:34.480 align:start position:0%
person already in custody who's
 
04:39:34.480 --> 04:39:35.750 align:start position:0%
person already in custody who's
attempting

04:39:35.750 --> 04:39:35.760 align:start position:0%
attempting
 
04:39:37.029 --> 04:39:37.039 align:start position:0%
to escape
 
04:39:38.868 --> 04:39:38.878 align:start position:0%
but this will prevent someone who's
 
04:39:40.470 --> 04:39:40.480 align:start position:0%
trying to escape
 
04:39:42.230 --> 04:39:42.240 align:start position:0%
that's not in custody
 
04:39:42.240 --> 04:39:43.030 align:start position:0%
that's not in custody
and

04:39:43.030 --> 04:39:43.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:39:44.390 --> 04:39:44.400 align:start position:0%
that and that's near and i'm just
 
04:39:46.070 --> 04:39:46.080 align:start position:0%
reading right off it is
 
04:39:48.310 --> 04:39:48.320 align:start position:0%
using a deadly weapon and attempting to
 
04:39:49.590 --> 04:39:49.600 align:start position:0%
escape so
 
04:39:52.070 --> 04:39:52.080 align:start position:0%
in that scenario i would assume
 
04:39:54.788 --> 04:39:54.798 align:start position:0%
the person has in their possession
 
04:39:56.470 --> 04:39:56.480 align:start position:0%
some sort of deadly weapon and they're
 
04:39:58.310 --> 04:39:58.320 align:start position:0%
using the deadly weapon
 
04:39:59.270 --> 04:39:59.280 align:start position:0%
to help
 
04:40:01.190 --> 04:40:01.200 align:start position:0%
further their escape and that's an
 
04:40:03.350 --> 04:40:03.360 align:start position:0%
escape to evade being arrested not to
 
04:40:05.510 --> 04:40:05.520 align:start position:0%
just get a baby
 
04:40:07.350 --> 04:40:07.360 align:start position:0%
escape custody does that make it does
 
04:40:08.868 --> 04:40:08.878 align:start position:0%
that help clarify it that's just the way
 
04:40:10.708 --> 04:40:10.718 align:start position:0%
i recovered
 
04:40:10.718 --> 04:40:16.390 align:start position:0%
i recovered
yes

04:40:16.390 --> 04:40:16.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:19.430 --> 04:40:19.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:22.070 --> 04:40:22.080 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and my only
 
04:40:25.510 --> 04:40:25.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:27.510 --> 04:40:27.520 align:start position:0%
and i pose it as a question
 
04:40:29.590 --> 04:40:29.600 align:start position:0%
when was the last time in the state of
 
04:40:32.230 --> 04:40:32.240 align:start position:0%
new hampshire i don't care about north
 
04:40:34.310 --> 04:40:34.320 align:start position:0%
carolina or florida
 
04:40:34.320 --> 04:40:35.590 align:start position:0%
carolina or florida
california

04:40:35.590 --> 04:40:35.600 align:start position:0%
california
 
04:40:38.550 --> 04:40:38.560 align:start position:0%
when in new hampshire was somebody shot
 
04:40:44.868 --> 04:40:44.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:51.110 --> 04:40:51.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:52.948 --> 04:40:52.958 align:start position:0%
just which it's trying to still be
 
04:40:55.590 --> 04:40:55.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:56.788 --> 04:40:56.798 align:start position:0%
representative martin do you mind just
 
04:40:58.470 --> 04:40:58.480 align:start position:0%
speaking louder some of the members who
 
04:41:00.708 --> 04:41:00.718 align:start position:0%
are participating remotely i could not
 
04:41:03.830 --> 04:41:03.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:03.840 --> 04:41:04.788 align:start position:0%
 
just

04:41:04.788 --> 04:41:04.798 align:start position:0%
just
 
04:41:06.230 --> 04:41:06.240 align:start position:0%
trying to not play with the microphones
 
04:41:09.270 --> 04:41:09.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:11.750 --> 04:41:11.760 align:start position:0%
i've never been accused of not speaking
 
04:41:12.948 --> 04:41:12.958 align:start position:0%
loud enough
 
04:41:16.310 --> 04:41:16.320 align:start position:0%
but i'll go again in that and just make
 
04:41:18.788 --> 04:41:18.798 align:start position:0%
this a rhetorical question because i
 
04:41:19.910 --> 04:41:19.920 align:start position:0%
don't believe
 
04:41:21.910 --> 04:41:21.920 align:start position:0%
it's ever happened in new hampshire now
 
04:41:23.510 --> 04:41:23.520 align:start position:0%
i could be wrong
 
04:41:26.310 --> 04:41:26.320 align:start position:0%
but i don't think anybody has been shot
 
04:41:28.070 --> 04:41:28.080 align:start position:0%
fleeing the police
 
04:41:29.990 --> 04:41:30.000 align:start position:0%
that is to say like you see in some of
 
04:41:31.590 --> 04:41:31.600 align:start position:0%
these other states they're shut in the
 
04:41:34.708 --> 04:41:34.718 align:start position:0%
back that don't happen in new hampshire
 
04:41:51.670 --> 04:41:51.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:00.710 --> 04:42:00.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:00.720 --> 04:42:06.948 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

04:42:06.948 --> 04:42:06.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:08.550 --> 04:42:08.560 align:start position:0%
was playing in a vehicle
 
04:42:10.550 --> 04:42:10.560 align:start position:0%
a few years ago and you're not able to
 
04:42:12.390 --> 04:42:12.400 align:start position:0%
determine representative i don't believe
 
04:42:14.708 --> 04:42:14.718 align:start position:0%
representative knight can uh hear you uh
 
04:42:16.948 --> 04:42:16.958 align:start position:0%
if you don't mind speaking
 
04:42:19.270 --> 04:42:19.280 align:start position:0%
speaking louder i'm not sure if there's
 
04:42:21.270 --> 04:42:21.280 align:start position:0%
even a microphone near me so i'm not
 
04:42:24.310 --> 04:42:24.320 align:start position:0%
sure how loudly to speak but i was only
 
04:42:26.390 --> 04:42:26.400 align:start position:0%
saying that i believe a few years ago in
 
04:42:28.868 --> 04:42:28.878 align:start position:0%
where there was a shooting involving
 
04:42:31.270 --> 04:42:31.280 align:start position:0%
police and a man who was fleeing
 
04:42:34.948 --> 04:42:34.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:38.550 --> 04:42:38.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:39.990 --> 04:42:40.000 align:start position:0%
representative hopper
 
04:42:42.470 --> 04:42:42.480 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chairman
 
04:42:44.788 --> 04:42:44.798 align:start position:0%
in response to uh representatives
 
04:42:46.868 --> 04:42:46.878 align:start position:0%
comment about where
 
04:42:46.878 --> 04:42:48.070 align:start position:0%
comment about where
um

04:42:48.070 --> 04:42:48.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:42:50.390 --> 04:42:50.400 align:start position:0%
i thought of that exact case we were
 
04:42:52.628 --> 04:42:52.638 align:start position:0%
when we were hearing the bill
 
04:42:54.708 --> 04:42:54.718 align:start position:0%
and the issue with that is the police
 
04:42:56.550 --> 04:42:56.560 align:start position:0%
and where believed that their lives were
 
04:42:57.750 --> 04:42:57.760 align:start position:0%
in danger
 
04:42:59.750 --> 04:42:59.760 align:start position:0%
because they were being attacked by the
 
04:43:01.430 --> 04:43:01.440 align:start position:0%
man's vehicle
 
04:43:02.948 --> 04:43:02.958 align:start position:0%
i believe the attorney general
 
04:43:04.868 --> 04:43:04.878 align:start position:0%
investigated that
 
04:43:04.878 --> 04:43:07.590 align:start position:0%
investigated that
and

04:43:07.590 --> 04:43:07.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:09.830 --> 04:43:09.840 align:start position:0%
i see the problem there not necessarily
 
04:43:12.470 --> 04:43:12.480 align:start position:0%
with the police but if the attorney
 
04:43:15.990 --> 04:43:16.000 align:start position:0%
general investigated that
 
04:43:19.110 --> 04:43:19.120 align:start position:0%
and the man was unarmed
 
04:43:20.868 --> 04:43:20.878 align:start position:0%
i i think
 
04:43:20.878 --> 04:43:21.590 align:start position:0%
i i think
the

04:43:21.590 --> 04:43:21.600 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:43:23.590 --> 04:43:23.600 align:start position:0%
issue might be with the attorney general
 
04:43:31.350 --> 04:43:31.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:34.708 --> 04:43:34.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:34.718 --> 04:43:35.990 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:43:35.990 --> 04:43:36.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:43:37.430 --> 04:43:37.440 align:start position:0%
i want to say that
 
04:43:39.270 --> 04:43:39.280 align:start position:0%
in my opinion
 
04:43:40.948 --> 04:43:40.958 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
04:43:40.958 --> 04:43:41.910 align:start position:0%
this bill
is

04:43:41.910 --> 04:43:41.920 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:43:43.990 --> 04:43:44.000 align:start position:0%
a start in trying to
 
04:43:44.000 --> 04:43:44.868 align:start position:0%
a start in trying to
um

04:43:44.868 --> 04:43:44.878 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:43:46.948 --> 04:43:46.958 align:start position:0%
i'm not saying limit the powers of the
 
04:43:49.670 --> 04:43:49.680 align:start position:0%
police department but put some guidance
 
04:43:51.270 --> 04:43:51.280 align:start position:0%
around what they do
 
04:43:53.750 --> 04:43:53.760 align:start position:0%
it's not saying that they can't
 
04:43:57.190 --> 04:43:57.200 align:start position:0%
arrest or any of those things okay
 
04:43:59.670 --> 04:43:59.680 align:start position:0%
what it's you know like i said removing
 
04:44:01.270 --> 04:44:01.280 align:start position:0%
the effect
 
04:44:03.110 --> 04:44:03.120 align:start position:0%
from the from the bill
 
04:44:06.310 --> 04:44:06.320 align:start position:0%
um does not change anything there and
 
04:44:07.590 --> 04:44:07.600 align:start position:0%
when you look at the section that you
 
04:44:09.910 --> 04:44:09.920 align:start position:0%
talked about in terms of um
 
04:44:12.150 --> 04:44:12.160 align:start position:0%
attempting to escape there's no change
 
04:44:14.310 --> 04:44:14.320 align:start position:0%
to that section so we're not even
 
04:44:16.550 --> 04:44:16.560 align:start position:0%
speaking on that we're speaking on the
 
04:44:18.070 --> 04:44:18.080 align:start position:0%
sections where
 
04:44:20.470 --> 04:44:20.480 align:start position:0%
effect and arrest
 
04:44:23.430 --> 04:44:23.440 align:start position:0%
is being requested to be removed
 
04:44:25.910 --> 04:44:25.920 align:start position:0%
so i will say again
 
04:44:28.550 --> 04:44:28.560 align:start position:0%
new hampshire has their problems
 
04:44:30.070 --> 04:44:30.080 align:start position:0%
always have
 
04:44:31.350 --> 04:44:31.360 align:start position:0%
and hopefully
 
04:44:33.510 --> 04:44:33.520 align:start position:0%
with the changing times things will
 
04:44:35.590 --> 04:44:35.600 align:start position:0%
change for the better
 
04:44:38.310 --> 04:44:38.320 align:start position:0%
but i've been here since 79 and i know
 
04:44:42.550 --> 04:44:42.560 align:start position:0%
for a fact and yes people have been shot
 
04:44:44.310 --> 04:44:44.320 align:start position:0%
and um so
 
04:44:47.030 --> 04:44:47.040 align:start position:0%
i'm just saying that for me
 
04:44:48.550 --> 04:44:48.560 align:start position:0%
this is
 
04:44:48.560 --> 04:44:51.590 align:start position:0%
this is
um

04:44:51.590 --> 04:44:51.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:51.600 --> 04:44:52.390 align:start position:0%
 
it's

04:44:52.390 --> 04:44:52.400 align:start position:0%
it's
 
04:44:54.150 --> 04:44:54.160 align:start position:0%
it's like
 
04:44:57.510 --> 04:44:57.520 align:start position:0%
a guidance for a police department okay
 
04:44:59.830 --> 04:44:59.840 align:start position:0%
um so that
 
04:45:02.550 --> 04:45:02.560 align:start position:0%
if they're doing their duty right
 
04:45:04.708 --> 04:45:04.718 align:start position:0%
the verge means nothing
 
04:45:06.070 --> 04:45:06.080 align:start position:0%
it really doesn't if they're doing what
 
04:45:07.510 --> 04:45:07.520 align:start position:0%
they're supposed to do
 
04:45:10.708 --> 04:45:10.718 align:start position:0%
then change removing effect
 
04:45:17.110 --> 04:45:17.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:20.070 --> 04:45:20.080 align:start position:0%
representative ordnay
 
04:45:21.030 --> 04:45:21.040 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:45:22.628 --> 04:45:22.638 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
04:45:25.990 --> 04:45:26.000 align:start position:0%
um i think that this bill has some merit
 
04:45:28.310 --> 04:45:28.320 align:start position:0%
i think uh we should
 
04:45:31.350 --> 04:45:31.360 align:start position:0%
make it off a path um
 
04:45:34.310 --> 04:45:34.320 align:start position:0%
i'll look at two things two questions
 
04:45:35.750 --> 04:45:35.760 align:start position:0%
a is
 
04:45:38.708 --> 04:45:38.718 align:start position:0%
uh under um a
 
04:45:41.190 --> 04:45:41.200 align:start position:0%
the officer still has the right to
 
04:45:43.830 --> 04:45:43.840 align:start position:0%
defend herself with basic force their
 
04:45:43.840 --> 04:45:44.708 align:start position:0%
defend herself with basic force their
life

04:45:44.708 --> 04:45:44.718 align:start position:0%
life
 
04:45:44.718 --> 04:45:46.628 align:start position:0%
life
is

04:45:46.628 --> 04:45:46.638 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:45:46.638 --> 04:45:48.070 align:start position:0%
is
threatened

04:45:48.070 --> 04:45:48.080 align:start position:0%
threatened
 
04:45:52.070 --> 04:45:52.080 align:start position:0%
however in b we look at
 
04:45:54.868 --> 04:45:54.878 align:start position:0%
the words are the officer reasonably
 
04:45:54.878 --> 04:45:55.910 align:start position:0%
the words are the officer reasonably
believe

04:45:55.910 --> 04:45:55.920 align:start position:0%
believe
 
04:45:58.550 --> 04:45:58.560 align:start position:0%
a person has committed or is committing
 
04:46:02.150 --> 04:46:02.160 align:start position:0%
a felony involving the use of foreign
 
04:46:03.430 --> 04:46:03.440 align:start position:0%
so if
 
04:46:05.350 --> 04:46:05.360 align:start position:0%
the officer is allowed to use every
 
04:46:07.350 --> 04:46:07.360 align:start position:0%
force in this case
 
04:46:10.070 --> 04:46:10.080 align:start position:0%
they are basically
 
04:46:10.080 --> 04:46:10.948 align:start position:0%
they are basically
the

04:46:10.948 --> 04:46:10.958 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:46:10.958 --> 04:46:11.910 align:start position:0%
the
judge

04:46:11.910 --> 04:46:11.920 align:start position:0%
judge
 
04:46:13.190 --> 04:46:13.200 align:start position:0%
in the jury
 
04:46:15.110 --> 04:46:15.120 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
04:46:17.750 --> 04:46:17.760 align:start position:0%
condemning someone who has not been
 
04:46:22.230 --> 04:46:22.240 align:start position:0%
convicted from you so i have to say that
 
04:46:22.240 --> 04:46:23.750 align:start position:0%
convicted from you so i have to say that
this

04:46:23.750 --> 04:46:23.760 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:46:23.760 --> 04:46:24.708 align:start position:0%
this
bill

04:46:24.708 --> 04:46:24.718 align:start position:0%
bill
 
04:46:32.150 --> 04:46:32.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:34.628 --> 04:46:34.638 align:start position:0%
representative testerman
 
04:46:37.350 --> 04:46:37.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:39.190 --> 04:46:39.200 align:start position:0%
what worries me here
 
04:46:40.310 --> 04:46:40.320 align:start position:0%
is that
 
04:46:41.830 --> 04:46:41.840 align:start position:0%
this is sort of a
 
04:46:44.628 --> 04:46:44.638 align:start position:0%
me too kind of a thing it's like my kid
 
04:46:47.110 --> 04:46:47.120 align:start position:0%
coming to me and saying i want to go
 
04:46:47.120 --> 04:46:48.628 align:start position:0%
coming to me and saying i want to go
wherever

04:46:48.628 --> 04:46:48.638 align:start position:0%
wherever
 
04:46:51.670 --> 04:46:51.680 align:start position:0%
because johnny is going there
 
04:46:55.030 --> 04:46:55.040 align:start position:0%
we're trying to appropriate
 
04:46:57.510 --> 04:46:57.520 align:start position:0%
into new hampshire
 
04:47:01.270 --> 04:47:01.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:04.070 --> 04:47:04.080 align:start position:0%
portland of minneapolis
 
04:47:06.470 --> 04:47:06.480 align:start position:0%
of california is
 
04:47:07.910 --> 04:47:07.920 align:start position:0%
of seattle
 
04:47:10.070 --> 04:47:10.080 align:start position:0%
and and we assume that they can happen
 
04:47:10.080 --> 04:47:11.110 align:start position:0%
and and we assume that they can happen
here

04:47:11.110 --> 04:47:11.120 align:start position:0%
here
 
04:47:12.868 --> 04:47:12.878 align:start position:0%
well maybe they could happen here but
 
04:47:15.110 --> 04:47:15.120 align:start position:0%
they haven't and i don't think it's you
 
04:47:18.070 --> 04:47:18.080 align:start position:0%
know here we are trying to second-guess
 
04:47:19.270 --> 04:47:19.280 align:start position:0%
the police
 
04:47:22.310 --> 04:47:22.320 align:start position:0%
and their training and and i just really
 
04:47:24.550 --> 04:47:24.560 align:start position:0%
take offense at the fact that
 
04:47:26.628 --> 04:47:26.638 align:start position:0%
something happened in minneapolis oh my
 
04:47:28.150 --> 04:47:28.160 align:start position:0%
goodness we have to do something about
 
04:47:30.070 --> 04:47:30.080 align:start position:0%
it or something happened in portland i
 
04:47:32.230 --> 04:47:32.240 align:start position:0%
know we have to do something about it i
 
04:47:33.590 --> 04:47:33.600 align:start position:0%
i just see
 
04:47:36.628 --> 04:47:36.638 align:start position:0%
a complete a me too kind of a
 
04:47:38.788 --> 04:47:38.798 align:start position:0%
system thank you
 
04:47:41.110 --> 04:47:41.120 align:start position:0%
just in fairness that point we did have
 
04:47:41.120 --> 04:47:41.910 align:start position:0%
just in fairness that point we did have
this

04:47:41.910 --> 04:47:41.920 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:47:45.750 --> 04:47:45.760 align:start position:0%
virtually identical bill filed last term
 
04:47:47.590 --> 04:47:47.600 align:start position:0%
in the first term before all those
 
04:47:49.670 --> 04:47:49.680 align:start position:0%
events occurred so
 
04:47:50.628 --> 04:47:50.638 align:start position:0%
i wouldn't
 
04:47:52.788 --> 04:47:52.798 align:start position:0%
i understand what what you mean by some
 
04:47:54.788 --> 04:47:54.798 align:start position:0%
legislation being reactive to odd state
 
04:47:56.948 --> 04:47:56.958 align:start position:0%
events i don't feel that out of i don't
 
04:47:58.708 --> 04:47:58.718 align:start position:0%
feel this one needs that because we did
 
04:47:59.670 --> 04:47:59.680 align:start position:0%
have it
 
04:48:01.350 --> 04:48:01.360 align:start position:0%
last year it was i believe had similar
 
04:48:04.550 --> 04:48:04.560 align:start position:0%
sponsors last year and uh
 
04:48:05.990 --> 04:48:06.000 align:start position:0%
but i do i do understand what you're
 
04:48:08.390 --> 04:48:08.400 align:start position:0%
saying i just want to clarify that
 
04:48:09.670 --> 04:48:09.680 align:start position:0%
the people who weren't on the committee
 
04:48:12.070 --> 04:48:12.080 align:start position:0%
last year the last term we heard of
 
04:48:17.030 --> 04:48:17.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:20.470 --> 04:48:20.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:22.390 --> 04:48:22.400 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman i'm really
 
04:48:27.430 --> 04:48:27.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:29.190 --> 04:48:29.200 align:start position:0%
association with this with the metoo
 
04:48:29.200 --> 04:48:30.390 align:start position:0%
association with this with the metoo
movement

04:48:30.390 --> 04:48:30.400 align:start position:0%
movement
 
04:48:32.708 --> 04:48:32.718 align:start position:0%
i'm if he could elaborate on that
 
04:48:35.030 --> 04:48:35.040 align:start position:0%
because i don't understand if he
 
04:48:37.510 --> 04:48:37.520 align:start position:0%
understands what the metoo movement was
 
04:48:52.070 --> 04:48:52.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:54.948 --> 04:48:54.958 align:start position:0%
do you want to address it thank you
 
04:48:57.670 --> 04:48:57.680 align:start position:0%
point of order mr chairman
 
04:48:59.510 --> 04:48:59.520 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chairman is this
 
04:49:01.750 --> 04:49:01.760 align:start position:0%
appropriate during an exec session that
 
04:49:06.948 --> 04:49:06.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:09.510 --> 04:49:09.520 align:start position:0%
well i i i think during the purpose of
 
04:49:11.110 --> 04:49:11.120 align:start position:0%
the discussions that we have during the
 
04:49:14.070 --> 04:49:14.080 align:start position:0%
executive session is if a member wants a
 
04:49:15.670 --> 04:49:15.680 align:start position:0%
ask of another member to clarify their
 
04:49:15.680 --> 04:49:16.948 align:start position:0%
ask of another member to clarify their
comments

04:49:16.948 --> 04:49:16.958 align:start position:0%
comments
 
04:49:18.310 --> 04:49:18.320 align:start position:0%
i think that's a fair question
 
04:49:25.990 --> 04:49:26.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:28.230 --> 04:49:28.240 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure that the
 
04:49:29.590 --> 04:49:29.600 align:start position:0%
me too
 
04:49:31.190 --> 04:49:31.200 align:start position:0%
has much to do with the use of force of
 
04:49:32.868 --> 04:49:32.878 align:start position:0%
all the police officers so i
 
04:49:36.310 --> 04:49:36.320 align:start position:0%
i would kind of get into whether this
 
04:49:38.150 --> 04:49:38.160 align:start position:0%
whether this is necessary purpose of
 
04:49:39.910 --> 04:49:39.920 align:start position:0%
this bill we are on when i say an
 
04:49:42.310 --> 04:49:42.320 align:start position:0%
incredibly tight schedule i don't know
 
04:49:44.628 --> 04:49:44.638 align:start position:0%
if getting off topic into another
 
04:49:46.070 --> 04:49:46.080 align:start position:0%
i would say
 
04:49:47.430 --> 04:49:47.440 align:start position:0%
we can talk about that topic that can
 
04:49:49.910 --> 04:49:49.920 align:start position:0%
take a full day so i'm not sure it would
 
04:49:51.430 --> 04:49:51.440 align:start position:0%
be helpful to this
 
04:49:53.030 --> 04:49:53.040 align:start position:0%
this discussion
 
04:49:55.030 --> 04:49:55.040 align:start position:0%
to discuss
 
04:49:57.190 --> 04:49:57.200 align:start position:0%
unrelated discussion of that nature i
 
04:49:57.200 --> 04:49:58.310 align:start position:0%
unrelated discussion of that nature i
will

04:49:58.310 --> 04:49:58.320 align:start position:0%
will
 
04:50:00.470 --> 04:50:00.480 align:start position:0%
allow you to clarify but i just don't i
 
04:50:01.910 --> 04:50:01.920 align:start position:0%
don't understand how
 
04:50:04.070 --> 04:50:04.080 align:start position:0%
you did say it which is the only just
 
04:50:05.350 --> 04:50:05.360 align:start position:0%
the mere fact you said is what made it
 
04:50:05.360 --> 04:50:09.910 align:start position:0%
the mere fact you said is what made it
relevant

04:50:09.910 --> 04:50:09.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:11.910 --> 04:50:11.920 align:start position:0%
i believe i know what they're referring
 
04:50:13.590 --> 04:50:13.600 align:start position:0%
to as me too
 
04:50:15.430 --> 04:50:15.440 align:start position:0%
they've appropriated that and that's
 
04:50:17.430 --> 04:50:17.440 align:start position:0%
fine for certain people
 
04:50:21.350 --> 04:50:21.360 align:start position:0%
i was using it in a general context
 
04:50:25.110 --> 04:50:25.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:29.350 --> 04:50:29.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:31.350 --> 04:50:31.360 align:start position:0%
i i don't have a question no throw out
 
04:50:40.948 --> 04:50:40.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:42.310 --> 04:50:42.320 align:start position:0%
representative roy
 
04:50:44.628 --> 04:50:44.638 align:start position:0%
thank you um i just
 
04:50:46.868 --> 04:50:46.878 align:start position:0%
i agree with the premise that a police
 
04:50:49.270 --> 04:50:49.280 align:start position:0%
officer should almost never shoot
 
04:50:51.110 --> 04:50:51.120 align:start position:0%
someone in the back who is fleeing a
 
04:50:51.120 --> 04:50:52.150 align:start position:0%
someone in the back who is fleeing a
scene

04:50:52.150 --> 04:50:52.160 align:start position:0%
scene
 
04:50:54.390 --> 04:50:54.400 align:start position:0%
um it should be so rare that it's almost
 
04:50:56.470 --> 04:50:56.480 align:start position:0%
non-existent however there are times
 
04:51:00.150 --> 04:51:00.160 align:start position:0%
when it could be necessary uh if a woman
 
04:51:01.750 --> 04:51:01.760 align:start position:0%
comes into the police department she
 
04:51:03.910 --> 04:51:03.920 align:start position:0%
severely beats me and nick takes out a
 
04:51:05.590 --> 04:51:05.600 align:start position:0%
complaint and he also goes to arrest the
 
04:51:07.270 --> 04:51:07.280 align:start position:0%
guy and he runs and says i'm going to
 
04:51:09.190 --> 04:51:09.200 align:start position:0%
kill her
 
04:51:10.788 --> 04:51:10.798 align:start position:0%
what does he just let him go because
 
04:51:12.550 --> 04:51:12.560 align:start position:0%
he's an arm but there's certain
 
04:51:14.948 --> 04:51:14.958 align:start position:0%
situations where we can't dictate that
 
04:51:16.948 --> 04:51:16.958 align:start position:0%
could happen on the fly
 
04:51:18.550 --> 04:51:18.560 align:start position:0%
the part of this law that bothers me is
 
04:51:20.628 --> 04:51:20.638 align:start position:0%
the part that says that an officer
 
04:51:23.110 --> 04:51:23.120 align:start position:0%
can respond to deadly force with deadly
 
04:51:23.120 --> 04:51:24.230 align:start position:0%
can respond to deadly force with deadly
force

04:51:24.230 --> 04:51:24.240 align:start position:0%
force
 
04:51:25.910 --> 04:51:25.920 align:start position:0%
it doesn't necessarily if you are shot
 
04:51:28.390 --> 04:51:28.400 align:start position:0%
with a taser you're incapacitated
 
04:51:30.788 --> 04:51:30.798 align:start position:0%
so you can't you can't that's not dead
 
04:51:32.708 --> 04:51:32.718 align:start position:0%
before as a matter of fact they say it's
 
04:51:32.718 --> 04:51:33.750 align:start position:0%
before as a matter of fact they say it's
not

04:51:33.750 --> 04:51:33.760 align:start position:0%
not
 
04:51:35.430 --> 04:51:35.440 align:start position:0%
but you'll be able to have them to
 
04:51:37.110 --> 04:51:37.120 align:start position:0%
defend yourself once you've been
 
04:51:39.590 --> 04:51:39.600 align:start position:0%
incapacitated by them so to put an
 
04:51:40.868 --> 04:51:40.878 align:start position:0%
officer in a position where someone
 
04:51:42.390 --> 04:51:42.400 align:start position:0%
picks up their taser
 
04:51:43.670 --> 04:51:43.680 align:start position:0%
that it could have fallen out or they
 
04:51:45.190 --> 04:51:45.200 align:start position:0%
could have pulled it off their belt and
 
04:51:46.868 --> 04:51:46.878 align:start position:0%
say well you can't use deadly force
 
04:51:49.670 --> 04:51:49.680 align:start position:0%
because that is a deadly force well
 
04:51:51.190 --> 04:51:51.200 align:start position:0%
you're going to be incapacitated so what
 
04:51:52.390 --> 04:51:52.400 align:start position:0%
happens after that you just got to
 
04:51:54.230 --> 04:51:54.240 align:start position:0%
hopefully they're nice i mean we're
 
04:51:56.788 --> 04:51:56.798 align:start position:0%
getting into so much minutia here that
 
04:51:57.990 --> 04:51:58.000 align:start position:0%
you're trying to anticipate every
 
04:52:00.150 --> 04:52:00.160 align:start position:0%
situation and you can
 
04:52:01.830 --> 04:52:01.840 align:start position:0%
so i feel like putting blanket
 
04:52:03.510 --> 04:52:03.520 align:start position:0%
statements out that you can only use
 
04:52:05.750 --> 04:52:05.760 align:start position:0%
deadly force in response to deadly force
 
04:52:07.830 --> 04:52:07.840 align:start position:0%
it's going to put police officers an
 
04:52:10.230 --> 04:52:10.240 align:start position:0%
untenable position but i i agree with
 
04:52:11.750 --> 04:52:11.760 align:start position:0%
cleaning up approaching the law that
 
04:52:13.590 --> 04:52:13.600 align:start position:0%
says you can't shoot affiliate
 
04:52:14.788 --> 04:52:14.798 align:start position:0%
just by the mere fact that they're
 
04:52:16.390 --> 04:52:16.400 align:start position:0%
felonies should never be shooting anyone
 
04:52:20.550 --> 04:52:20.560 align:start position:0%
back in extremely unknown circumstances
 
04:52:22.310 --> 04:52:22.320 align:start position:0%
representative welch
 
04:52:24.390 --> 04:52:24.400 align:start position:0%
i wonder if everybody in this
 
04:52:28.070 --> 04:52:28.080 align:start position:0%
community will remember ed brown
 
04:52:29.590 --> 04:52:29.600 align:start position:0%
ed brown
 
04:52:32.390 --> 04:52:32.400 align:start position:0%
had 35 corporations at home
 
04:52:34.390 --> 04:52:34.400 align:start position:0%
they surrounded the home and was
 
04:52:41.270 --> 04:52:41.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:43.110 --> 04:52:43.120 align:start position:0%
it doesn't happen that often when it
 
04:52:44.948 --> 04:52:44.958 align:start position:0%
does happen there's probably a good
 
04:52:51.350 --> 04:52:51.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:53.670 --> 04:52:53.680 align:start position:0%
representative bolden
 
04:52:56.390 --> 04:52:56.400 align:start position:0%
i'll try to speak loudly i hope that the
 
04:52:59.350 --> 04:52:59.360 align:start position:0%
folks can hear me thank you mr parent
 
04:53:01.350 --> 04:53:01.360 align:start position:0%
um i just wanted to clarify something
 
04:53:02.788 --> 04:53:02.798 align:start position:0%
that was brought up earlier it has
 
04:53:04.948 --> 04:53:04.958 align:start position:0%
happened in new hampshire
 
04:53:07.350 --> 04:53:07.360 align:start position:0%
specifically the incident and where
 
04:53:09.110 --> 04:53:09.120 align:start position:0%
we pretty much could take a position on
 
04:53:10.868 --> 04:53:10.878 align:start position:0%
whether it was justified
 
04:53:12.390 --> 04:53:12.400 align:start position:0%
they they didn't find that it was
 
04:53:13.750 --> 04:53:13.760 align:start position:0%
justified they didn't find that it was
 
04:53:16.948 --> 04:53:16.958 align:start position:0%
not justified they they took no position
 
04:53:18.470 --> 04:53:18.480 align:start position:0%
um and the
 
04:53:21.670 --> 04:53:21.680 align:start position:0%
man who was shot he died and
 
04:53:24.470 --> 04:53:24.480 align:start position:0%
he was waiting arrest at the time
 
04:53:27.590 --> 04:53:27.600 align:start position:0%
and was bullying and his family won a
 
04:53:29.350 --> 04:53:29.360 align:start position:0%

04:53:31.030 --> 04:53:31.040 align:start position:0%

frankly i've been a little bit disturbed
 
05:00:29.910 --> 05:00:29.920 align:start position:0%
by the behavior of some committee
 
05:00:31.670 --> 05:00:31.680 align:start position:0%
members uh during some of the previous
 
05:00:33.350 --> 05:00:33.360 align:start position:0%
testimony on this bill and just i hope
 
05:00:35.190 --> 05:00:35.200 align:start position:0%
that committee members will take this
 
05:00:37.830 --> 05:00:37.840 align:start position:0%
seriously and and vote ought to pass
 
05:00:45.990 --> 05:00:46.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:47.430 --> 05:00:47.440 align:start position:0%

okay awesome
 
05:01:15.430 --> 05:01:15.440 align:start position:0%
good afternoon my name is renelle chella
 
05:01:16.708 --> 05:01:16.718 align:start position:0%
co-founder of black lives matter
 
05:01:18.788 --> 05:01:18.798 align:start position:0%
manchester i'm here today to testify in
 
05:01:21.190 --> 05:01:21.200 align:start position:0%
support of hp 564
 
05:01:23.590 --> 05:01:23.600 align:start position:0%
on behalf of the organization in june of
 
05:01:25.190 --> 05:01:25.200 align:start position:0%
last year we held a peaceful candlelight
 
05:01:27.110 --> 05:01:27.120 align:start position:0%
vigil at manchester and stark park in
 
05:01:29.350 --> 05:01:29.360 align:start position:0%
the days that preceded many advised us
 
05:01:31.430 --> 05:01:31.440 align:start position:0%
to cancel that event and i was told by
 
05:01:33.350 --> 05:01:33.360 align:start position:0%
mpd so this is the manchester police
 
05:01:35.430 --> 05:01:35.440 align:start position:0%
department that unfortunately things
 
05:01:37.670 --> 05:01:37.680 align:start position:0%
were going to get ugly we had seen the
 
05:01:39.430 --> 05:01:39.440 align:start position:0%
aftermath of police presence at similar
 
05:01:41.510 --> 05:01:41.520 align:start position:0%
events all across the country the use
 
05:01:42.948 --> 05:01:42.958 align:start position:0%
and misuse of tear gas and rubber
 
05:01:44.708 --> 05:01:44.718 align:start position:0%
bullets caused permanent physical and
 
05:01:47.110 --> 05:01:47.120 align:start position:0%
emotional damage to undeserving targets
 
05:01:48.868 --> 05:01:48.878 align:start position:0%
going into sark park that night that was
 
05:01:50.868 --> 05:01:50.878 align:start position:0%
the number one fear on our list i
 
05:01:52.310 --> 05:01:52.320 align:start position:0%
thought of the possibility of spending
 
05:01:54.470 --> 05:01:54.480 align:start position:0%
the week of my 21st birthday in a
 
05:01:56.230 --> 05:01:56.240 align:start position:0%
hospital bed recovering from injuries
 
05:01:57.750 --> 05:01:57.760 align:start position:0%
given to me by the one sworn to serve
 
05:02:00.070 --> 05:02:00.080 align:start position:0%
and protect it could have been me let me
 
05:02:01.750 --> 05:02:01.760 align:start position:0%
be clear new hampshire is not immune to
 
05:02:03.910 --> 05:02:03.920 align:start position:0%
having similar events occur here so the
 
05:02:06.230 --> 05:02:06.240 align:start position:0%
fact that these things are not used here
 
05:02:08.310 --> 05:02:08.320 align:start position:0%
that often is irrelevant new hampshire
 
05:02:09.670 --> 05:02:09.680 align:start position:0%
says new hampshire is by no means
 
05:02:11.750 --> 05:02:11.760 align:start position:0%
innocent at any moment this past summer
 
05:02:13.190 --> 05:02:13.200 align:start position:0%
our cities and towns could have made
 
05:02:14.868 --> 05:02:14.878 align:start position:0%
national news as a result of peaceful
 
05:02:16.708 --> 05:02:16.718 align:start position:0%
protest gone wrong and that's when many
 
05:02:18.390 --> 05:02:18.400 align:start position:0%
of these events turn violent by the way
 
05:02:19.830 --> 05:02:19.840 align:start position:0%
it doesn't matter how
 
05:02:22.070 --> 05:02:22.080 align:start position:0%
it doesn't matter that um
 
05:02:23.510 --> 05:02:23.520 align:start position:0%
we haven't seen these things happen in
 
05:02:25.270 --> 05:02:25.280 align:start position:0%
new hampshire because
 
05:02:27.110 --> 05:02:27.120 align:start position:0%
it could very well turn violent not at
 
05:02:28.868 --> 05:02:28.878 align:start position:0%
the hands of us the organizers but at
 
05:02:30.708 --> 05:02:30.718 align:start position:0%
the hands of the ones who arrived under
 
05:02:32.868 --> 05:02:32.878 align:start position:0%
the guise of maintaining order with that
 
05:02:34.150 --> 05:02:34.160 align:start position:0%
black lives matter manchester
 
05:02:35.990 --> 05:02:36.000 align:start position:0%
enthusiastically enthusiastically
 
05:02:37.430 --> 05:02:37.440 align:start position:0%
supports this bill and we're asking that
 
05:02:39.910 --> 05:02:39.920 align:start position:0%
you do do the same and i just would also
 
05:02:42.150 --> 05:02:42.160 align:start position:0%
like to say that i would ask the chair
 
05:02:43.990 --> 05:02:44.000 align:start position:0%
to reconsider his decision to not
 
05:02:45.910 --> 05:02:45.920 align:start position:0%
reprimand the representative that
 
05:02:47.750 --> 05:02:47.760 align:start position:0%
laughed during jordan's testimony
 
05:02:53.060 --> 05:02:53.070 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:53.070 --> 05:02:55.030 align:start position:0%

dunbarton new hampshire former state rep
 
05:03:31.750 --> 05:03:31.760 align:start position:0%
i'm currently on the board of the new
 
05:03:33.910 --> 05:03:33.920 align:start position:0%
hampshire firearms coalition
 
05:03:36.470 --> 05:03:36.480 align:start position:0%
i did not sign in favor or in opposition
 
05:03:38.470 --> 05:03:38.480 align:start position:0%
to this bill i wanted to point out
 
05:03:41.430 --> 05:03:41.440 align:start position:0%
something that's important which is
 
05:03:43.910 --> 05:03:43.920 align:start position:0%
has to do with the lethal use of lethal
 
05:03:43.920 --> 05:03:44.948 align:start position:0%
has to do with the lethal use of lethal
force

05:03:44.948 --> 05:03:44.958 align:start position:0%
force
 
05:03:47.270 --> 05:03:47.280 align:start position:0%
there is a policy known as escalation of
 
05:03:50.070 --> 05:03:50.080 align:start position:0%
force from not response on the on the
 
05:03:52.550 --> 05:03:52.560 align:start position:0%
benign end all the way over to lethal
 
05:03:52.560 --> 05:03:53.830 align:start position:0%
benign end all the way over to lethal
force

05:03:53.830 --> 05:03:53.840 align:start position:0%
force
 
05:03:56.150 --> 05:03:56.160 align:start position:0%
on the extreme end
 
05:03:58.150 --> 05:03:58.160 align:start position:0%
and i want the committee to understand
 
05:04:00.230 --> 05:04:00.240 align:start position:0%
that if they pass this bill
 
05:04:02.550 --> 05:04:02.560 align:start position:0%
they're going to limit the options and i
 
05:04:04.150 --> 05:04:04.160 align:start position:0%
don't want to see a situation where a
 
05:04:06.470 --> 05:04:06.480 align:start position:0%
police officer is ever forced to make a
 
05:04:08.550 --> 05:04:08.560 align:start position:0%
tough decision between not responding at
 
05:04:11.830 --> 05:04:11.840 align:start position:0%
all and having to use lethal force
 
05:04:13.590 --> 05:04:13.600 align:start position:0%
i do think
 
05:04:16.230 --> 05:04:16.240 align:start position:0%
that appropriate statutes should be in
 
05:04:16.240 --> 05:04:17.190 align:start position:0%
that appropriate statutes should be in
place

05:04:17.190 --> 05:04:17.200 align:start position:0%
place
 
05:04:20.868 --> 05:04:20.878 align:start position:0%
that if a person an officer misuses
 
05:04:22.470 --> 05:04:22.480 align:start position:0%
non-lethal force
 
05:04:23.830 --> 05:04:23.840 align:start position:0%
and it results in unintended
 
05:04:23.840 --> 05:04:25.270 align:start position:0%
and it results in unintended
consequences

05:04:25.270 --> 05:04:25.280 align:start position:0%
consequences
 
05:04:27.190 --> 05:04:27.200 align:start position:0%
for instance firing a rubber bullet into
 
05:04:28.550 --> 05:04:28.560 align:start position:0%
a crowd and hitting an innocent
 
05:04:31.190 --> 05:04:31.200 align:start position:0%
bystander that appropriate
 
05:04:33.110 --> 05:04:33.120 align:start position:0%
discipline is in place and i think
 
05:04:35.830 --> 05:04:35.840 align:start position:0%
that's the the message coming from um
 
05:04:37.190 --> 05:04:37.200 align:start position:0%
those who are expressing a desire to
 
05:04:39.110 --> 05:04:39.120 align:start position:0%
pass this bill and i'm not sure our
 
05:04:41.110 --> 05:04:41.120 align:start position:0%
statutes do a good job about assigning
 
05:04:42.868 --> 05:04:42.878 align:start position:0%
responsibility to the officer for
 
05:04:42.878 --> 05:04:43.990 align:start position:0%
responsibility to the officer for
misusing

05:04:43.990 --> 05:04:44.000 align:start position:0%
misusing
 
05:04:46.948 --> 05:04:46.958 align:start position:0%
a less than lethal force tool
 
05:04:49.430 --> 05:04:49.440 align:start position:0%
um the bill has filed i have concerns
 
05:04:50.948 --> 05:04:50.958 align:start position:0%
with but the bill
 
05:04:50.958 --> 05:04:51.830 align:start position:0%
with but the bill
um

05:04:51.830 --> 05:04:51.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:04:54.390 --> 05:04:54.400 align:start position:0%
the idea of making sure that police
 
05:04:56.310 --> 05:04:56.320 align:start position:0%
officers are held accountable for misuse
 
05:04:58.390 --> 05:04:58.400 align:start position:0%
of force is an appropriate thing to do
 
05:05:01.510 --> 05:05:01.520 align:start position:0%
in statute
 
05:05:04.868 --> 05:05:04.878 align:start position:0%
and that concludes my testimony
 
05:05:08.788 --> 05:05:08.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:09.910 --> 05:05:09.920 align:start position:0%
see no
 
05:05:11.830 --> 05:05:11.840 align:start position:0%
seeing no hands raised the witness is
 
05:05:11.840 --> 05:05:15.270 align:start position:0%
seeing no hands raised the witness is
excused

05:05:15.270 --> 05:05:15.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:20.150 --> 05:05:20.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:22.550 --> 05:05:22.560 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair uh representative max
 
05:05:24.310 --> 05:05:24.320 align:start position:0%
abramson representing hampton hampton
 
05:05:25.990 --> 05:05:26.000 align:start position:0%
falls and seabrook
 
05:05:28.070 --> 05:05:28.080 align:start position:0%
i disagree with the bill um i haven't
 
05:05:30.070 --> 05:05:30.080 align:start position:0%
seen the amendment but i
 
05:05:31.670 --> 05:05:31.680 align:start position:0%
agree with what the bill is trying to do
 
05:05:33.750 --> 05:05:33.760 align:start position:0%
except that i would say that i i think
 
05:05:36.628 --> 05:05:36.638 align:start position:0%
it's much preferable and even laudable
 
05:05:40.310 --> 05:05:40.320 align:start position:0%
that police use uh non-lethal force and
 
05:05:42.868 --> 05:05:42.878 align:start position:0%
non-deadly force whenever it's possible
 
05:05:43.990 --> 05:05:44.000 align:start position:0%
i've started putting together an
 
05:05:45.990 --> 05:05:46.000 align:start position:0%
amendment on this bill also
 
05:05:47.750 --> 05:05:47.760 align:start position:0%
and it would simply take
 
05:05:49.910 --> 05:05:49.920 align:start position:0%
the use of rubber bullets and tear gas
 
05:05:52.310 --> 05:05:52.320 align:start position:0%
and instead of it being prohibited
 
05:05:53.990 --> 05:05:54.000 align:start position:0%
i would put that in the definition of
 
05:05:56.628 --> 05:05:56.638 align:start position:0%
non-deadly force which is in rsa 627
 
05:05:58.948 --> 05:05:58.958 align:start position:0%
section 9 part 4.
 
05:06:01.910 --> 05:06:01.920 align:start position:0%
and that's being drafted right now
 
05:06:03.910 --> 05:06:03.920 align:start position:0%
the deadly force
 
05:06:05.110 --> 05:06:05.120 align:start position:0%
during the
 
05:06:07.830 --> 05:06:07.840 align:start position:0%
blm riots all summer
 
05:06:10.550 --> 05:06:10.560 align:start position:0%
over 40 people were killed police would
 
05:06:12.948 --> 05:06:12.958 align:start position:0%
be allowed to use deadly force for that
 
05:06:12.958 --> 05:06:14.390 align:start position:0%
be allowed to use deadly force for that
um

05:06:14.390 --> 05:06:14.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:06:15.830 --> 05:06:15.840 align:start position:0%
many buildings were burned down some
 
05:06:18.070 --> 05:06:18.080 align:start position:0%
occupied hundreds of vehicles were were
 
05:06:20.390 --> 05:06:20.400 align:start position:0%
destroyed vehicles drivers were attacked
 
05:06:22.390 --> 05:06:22.400 align:start position:0%
some of them with family and animals in
 
05:06:24.550 --> 05:06:24.560 align:start position:0%
the vehicle
 
05:06:25.750 --> 05:06:25.760 align:start position:0%
it's a question about whether or not
 
05:06:27.350 --> 05:06:27.360 align:start position:0%
you'd be allowed to use an officer would
 
05:06:28.788 --> 05:06:28.798 align:start position:0%
be allowed to use deadly or non-deadly
 
05:06:30.390 --> 05:06:30.400 align:start position:0%
force in that situation so that's
 
05:06:31.990 --> 05:06:32.000 align:start position:0%
another a great area we have to deal
 
05:06:32.000 --> 05:06:32.868 align:start position:0%
another a great area we have to deal
with

05:06:32.868 --> 05:06:32.878 align:start position:0%
with
 
05:06:35.030 --> 05:06:35.040 align:start position:0%
another one is
 
05:06:37.510 --> 05:06:37.520 align:start position:0%
you had people screaming racial slurs at
 
05:06:39.510 --> 05:06:39.520 align:start position:0%
black and latino officers during those
 
05:06:39.520 --> 05:06:40.788 align:start position:0%
black and latino officers during those
protests

05:06:40.788 --> 05:06:40.798 align:start position:0%
protests
 
05:06:42.708 --> 05:06:42.718 align:start position:0%
and that's also another question because
 
05:06:44.230 --> 05:06:44.240 align:start position:0%
that type of
 
05:06:46.470 --> 05:06:46.480 align:start position:0%
screaming sometimes does lead to an
 
05:06:49.190 --> 05:06:49.200 align:start position:0%
escalation of violence so i think to to
 
05:06:51.430 --> 05:06:51.440 align:start position:0%
be absolutely clear
 
05:06:53.750 --> 05:06:53.760 align:start position:0%
this committee has done it before
 
05:06:55.430 --> 05:06:55.440 align:start position:0%
with both deadly force and non-deadly
 
05:06:57.750 --> 05:06:57.760 align:start position:0%
force is to add in
 
05:07:01.750 --> 05:07:01.760 align:start position:0%
the use of tear gas or rubber bullets as
 
05:07:02.948 --> 05:07:02.958 align:start position:0%
putting it under the definition of
 
05:07:09.350 --> 05:07:09.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:15.270 --> 05:07:15.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:17.110 --> 05:07:17.120 align:start position:0%
someone's on mute
 
05:07:19.030 --> 05:07:19.040 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:07:23.430 --> 05:07:23.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:28.230 --> 05:07:28.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:40.310 --> 05:07:40.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:49.990 --> 05:07:50.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:53.350 --> 05:07:53.360 align:start position:0%

hb564
 
05:08:15.110 --> 05:08:15.120 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my testimony um
 
05:08:17.270 --> 05:08:17.280 align:start position:0%
just hearing from what happened today
 
05:08:19.590 --> 05:08:19.600 align:start position:0%
just kind of want to express some things
 
05:08:21.270 --> 05:08:21.280 align:start position:0%
i think it's very important that we're
 
05:08:23.110 --> 05:08:23.120 align:start position:0%
listening to vulnerable communities that
 
05:08:26.070 --> 05:08:26.080 align:start position:0%
took time out of their day today to let
 
05:08:27.750 --> 05:08:27.760 align:start position:0%
you know how they're feeling and how
 
05:08:29.910 --> 05:08:29.920 align:start position:0%
scared they are when they go out to
 
05:08:32.788 --> 05:08:32.798 align:start position:0%
express their constitutional right
 
05:08:35.270 --> 05:08:35.280 align:start position:0%
to express themselves and we heard
 
05:08:36.868 --> 05:08:36.878 align:start position:0%
particularly from the black community
 
05:08:39.110 --> 05:08:39.120 align:start position:0%
that this is needed and i think we need
 
05:08:39.120 --> 05:08:40.070 align:start position:0%
that this is needed and i think we need
to

05:08:40.070 --> 05:08:40.080 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:08:42.230 --> 05:08:42.240 align:start position:0%
listen to our community members that are
 
05:08:44.868 --> 05:08:44.878 align:start position:0%
vulnerable i also want to express my
 
05:08:47.750 --> 05:08:47.760 align:start position:0%
extreme disappointment that somebody was
 
05:08:50.390 --> 05:08:50.400 align:start position:0%
cut off earlier a black gentleman who
 
05:08:53.750 --> 05:08:53.760 align:start position:0%
expressed um racism or expressed the the
 
05:08:55.590 --> 05:08:55.600 align:start position:0%
fact that there is racism in our state
 
05:08:57.830 --> 05:08:57.840 align:start position:0%
and there was laughing from our
 
05:08:59.990 --> 05:09:00.000 align:start position:0%
representatives i think that is very
 
05:09:01.350 --> 05:09:01.360 align:start position:0%
inappropriate and something should be
 
05:09:04.150 --> 05:09:04.160 align:start position:0%
done about that that sends a a wrong
 
05:09:06.150 --> 05:09:06.160 align:start position:0%
message to our community members that
 
05:09:08.230 --> 05:09:08.240 align:start position:0%
their experiences are invalid just
 
05:09:09.910 --> 05:09:09.920 align:start position:0%
because others don't face them
 
05:09:12.868 --> 05:09:12.878 align:start position:0%
themselves um so it's uh i think it's
 
05:09:14.070 --> 05:09:14.080 align:start position:0%
very important that we're passing
 
05:09:15.430 --> 05:09:15.440 align:start position:0%
something like this to protect
 
05:09:17.670 --> 05:09:17.680 align:start position:0%
vulnerable communities and to send them
 
05:09:19.350 --> 05:09:19.360 align:start position:0%
a message that we are there for them
 
05:09:20.868 --> 05:09:20.878 align:start position:0%
when they're coming to us and they're
 
05:09:23.670 --> 05:09:23.680 align:start position:0%
saying they need to be protected and so
 
05:09:25.350 --> 05:09:25.360 align:start position:0%
when people say this doesn't happen in
 
05:09:27.350 --> 05:09:27.360 align:start position:0%
new hampshire they're basically saying
 
05:09:29.110 --> 05:09:29.120 align:start position:0%
we're not going to protect you from
 
05:09:31.110 --> 05:09:31.120 align:start position:0%
making sure it doesn't happen in new
 
05:09:39.430 --> 05:09:39.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:41.270 --> 05:09:41.280 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony
 
05:09:42.628 --> 05:09:42.638 align:start position:0%
seeing no
 
05:09:44.230 --> 05:09:44.240 align:start position:0%
no hands raised
 
05:10:04.310 --> 05:10:04.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:05.750 --> 05:10:05.760 align:start position:0%
the public hearing
 
05:10:11.190 --> 05:10:11.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:13.030 --> 05:10:13.040 align:start position:0%
we will
 
05:10:15.750 --> 05:10:15.760 align:start position:0%
now reopen the public hearing on house
 
05:10:26.788 --> 05:10:26.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:26.798 --> 05:10:57.030 align:start position:0%
 
so

05:10:57.030 --> 05:10:57.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:02.550 --> 05:11:02.560 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:04.788 --> 05:11:04.798 align:start position:0%
that was the c or k
 
05:11:05.910 --> 05:11:05.920 align:start position:0%
with the k
 
05:11:12.628 --> 05:11:12.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:15.030 --> 05:11:15.040 align:start position:0%
can you hear me now
 
05:11:15.040 --> 05:11:17.350 align:start position:0%
can you hear me now
yes

05:11:17.350 --> 05:11:17.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:19.110 --> 05:11:19.120 align:start position:0%
i'm reverend kendra ford and i'm an
 
05:11:20.788 --> 05:11:20.798 align:start position:0%
ordained minister in the unitarian
 
05:11:23.270 --> 05:11:23.280 align:start position:0%
universalist tradition and i have served
 
05:11:25.110 --> 05:11:25.120 align:start position:0%
a congregation in exeter new hampshire
 
05:11:27.510 --> 05:11:27.520 align:start position:0%
for 19 years
 
05:11:30.788 --> 05:11:30.798 align:start position:0%
i'm here to testify against hb 81
 
05:11:32.708 --> 05:11:32.718 align:start position:0%
and i will submit some written testimony
 
05:11:32.718 --> 05:11:33.830 align:start position:0%
and i will submit some written testimony
for

05:11:33.830 --> 05:11:33.840 align:start position:0%
for
 
05:11:37.590 --> 05:11:37.600 align:start position:0%
hb 145 and 197 as well i can't stay for
 
05:11:41.030 --> 05:11:41.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:43.110 --> 05:11:43.120 align:start position:0%
many of the situations in which lethal
 
05:11:45.990 --> 05:11:46.000 align:start position:0%
force would be allowed are situations in
 
05:11:48.070 --> 05:11:48.080 align:start position:0%
which people make choices based on how
 
05:11:49.430 --> 05:11:49.440 align:start position:0%
they feel
 
05:11:51.190 --> 05:11:51.200 align:start position:0%
in a given moment
 
05:11:53.190 --> 05:11:53.200 align:start position:0%
and most of us do not make our best
 
05:11:55.750 --> 05:11:55.760 align:start position:0%
choices in unpredictable situations
 
05:11:55.760 --> 05:11:57.110 align:start position:0%
choices in unpredictable situations
because

05:11:57.110 --> 05:11:57.120 align:start position:0%
because
 
05:11:59.590 --> 05:11:59.600 align:start position:0%
our limbic brain is activated
 
05:12:01.830 --> 05:12:01.840 align:start position:0%
which is to say we're not thinking we're
 
05:12:04.070 --> 05:12:04.080 align:start position:0%
just feeling
 
05:12:08.390 --> 05:12:08.400 align:start position:0%
hb 81 as well as 145 and 197
 
05:12:10.788 --> 05:12:10.798 align:start position:0%
allow people to shoot others because
 
05:12:12.830 --> 05:12:12.840 align:start position:0%
they feel
 
05:12:12.840 --> 05:12:14.628 align:start position:0%
they feel
threatened

05:12:14.628 --> 05:12:14.638 align:start position:0%
threatened
 
05:12:17.110 --> 05:12:17.120 align:start position:0%
when there is not necessarily actually a
 
05:12:17.120 --> 05:12:18.230 align:start position:0%
when there is not necessarily actually a
threat

05:12:18.230 --> 05:12:18.240 align:start position:0%
threat
 
05:12:20.868 --> 05:12:20.878 align:start position:0%
we have seen this occur over and over
 
05:12:23.030 --> 05:12:23.040 align:start position:0%
around our country
 
05:12:25.270 --> 05:12:25.280 align:start position:0%
african-american people in particular
 
05:12:27.510 --> 05:12:27.520 align:start position:0%
have been shot because
 
05:12:29.270 --> 05:12:29.280 align:start position:0%
white people feel uneasy in their
 
05:12:29.280 --> 05:12:30.470 align:start position:0%
white people feel uneasy in their
presence

05:12:30.470 --> 05:12:30.480 align:start position:0%
presence
 
05:12:32.550 --> 05:12:32.560 align:start position:0%
multiple studies have shown that white
 
05:12:34.708 --> 05:12:34.718 align:start position:0%
people are irrationally uneasy in the
 
05:12:36.708 --> 05:12:36.718 align:start position:0%
presence of people of color
 
05:12:40.788 --> 05:12:40.798 align:start position:0%
even in objectively neutral situations
 
05:12:42.390 --> 05:12:42.400 align:start position:0%
so these bills
 
05:12:44.470 --> 05:12:44.480 align:start position:0%
that allow the expanded use of weapons
 
05:12:47.590 --> 05:12:47.600 align:start position:0%
when people feel threatened
 
05:12:49.510 --> 05:12:49.520 align:start position:0%
are likely to be life-threatening for
 
05:12:52.390 --> 05:12:52.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:54.550 --> 05:12:54.560 align:start position:0%
expanding when people can use deadly
 
05:12:56.948 --> 05:12:56.958 align:start position:0%
force means that we are deciding to
 
05:12:59.190 --> 05:12:59.200 align:start position:0%
privilege the use of guns
 
05:13:02.310 --> 05:13:02.320 align:start position:0%
over the well-being of humans
 
05:13:03.910 --> 05:13:03.920 align:start position:0%
and saying that we think it is more
 
05:13:06.070 --> 05:13:06.080 align:start position:0%
important to protect things
 
05:13:09.510 --> 05:13:09.520 align:start position:0%
than the sanctity of human life
 
05:13:11.910 --> 05:13:11.920 align:start position:0%
giving people wider authorization to
 
05:13:14.310 --> 05:13:14.320 align:start position:0%
solve problems by shooting
 
05:13:16.310 --> 05:13:16.320 align:start position:0%
doesn't solve any problems in our
 
05:13:19.270 --> 05:13:19.280 align:start position:0%
society if there are problems that
 
05:13:21.350 --> 05:13:21.360 align:start position:0%
need to be solved that are conflicts
 
05:13:22.708 --> 05:13:22.718 align:start position:0%
between people
 
05:13:25.430 --> 05:13:25.440 align:start position:0%
conflicts over the taking of things
 
05:13:27.190 --> 05:13:27.200 align:start position:0%
i want us to look
 
05:13:29.190 --> 05:13:29.200 align:start position:0%
back upstream
 
05:13:32.150 --> 05:13:32.160 align:start position:0%
and figure out the sources of the fear
 
05:13:34.470 --> 05:13:34.480 align:start position:0%
and the anger and apply our work and our
 
05:13:37.190 --> 05:13:37.200 align:start position:0%
resources there
 
05:13:39.270 --> 05:13:39.280 align:start position:0%
i would ask that instead of legislating
 
05:13:41.590 --> 05:13:41.600 align:start position:0%
to expand gun use
 
05:13:43.510 --> 05:13:43.520 align:start position:0%
that we put our state and community
 
05:13:46.150 --> 05:13:46.160 align:start position:0%
resources into training the public and
 
05:13:49.510 --> 05:13:49.520 align:start position:0%
the police in methods of de-escalation
 
05:13:51.270 --> 05:13:51.280 align:start position:0%
and that we address our society
 
05:13:53.430 --> 05:13:53.440 align:start position:0%
conflicts and unease
 
05:13:55.750 --> 05:13:55.760 align:start position:0%
in ways that build connection and value
 
05:13:57.270 --> 05:13:57.280 align:start position:0%
human living
 
05:13:59.990 --> 05:14:00.000 align:start position:0%
over material things
 
05:14:01.910 --> 05:14:01.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for your time and for all the
 
05:14:06.310 --> 05:14:06.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:07.910 --> 05:14:07.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for your thank you for your
 
05:14:07.920 --> 05:14:10.390 align:start position:0%

testimony
 
05:14:12.230 --> 05:14:12.240 align:start position:0%
representative testament
 
05:14:13.430 --> 05:14:13.440 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:14:15.430 --> 05:14:15.440 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
05:14:17.910 --> 05:14:17.920 align:start position:0%
i have a simple one
 
05:14:20.390 --> 05:14:20.400 align:start position:0%
do you believe that it's all right
 
05:14:22.310 --> 05:14:22.320 align:start position:0%
to take a life of an
 
05:14:24.390 --> 05:14:24.400 align:start position:0%
unborn infant
 
05:14:27.910 --> 05:14:27.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:30.550 --> 05:14:30.560 align:start position:0%
i asked the witness to
 
05:14:33.270 --> 05:14:33.280 align:start position:0%
not answer that question
 
05:14:35.350 --> 05:14:35.360 align:start position:0%
this is this is not i don't see how it's
 
05:14:42.470 --> 05:14:42.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:42.480 --> 05:14:43.510 align:start position:0%
 
but

05:14:43.510 --> 05:14:43.520 align:start position:0%
but
 
05:14:46.150 --> 05:14:46.160 align:start position:0%
i respectfully to the representative
 
05:14:48.708 --> 05:14:48.718 align:start position:0%
i don't believe the issue of
 
05:14:51.190 --> 05:14:51.200 align:start position:0%
abortion or pro-life whatever everyone
 
05:14:53.830 --> 05:14:53.840 align:start position:0%
call it is relevant to this bill that's
 
05:14:56.390 --> 05:14:56.400 align:start position:0%
my this decision there's also a point of
 
05:14:57.590 --> 05:14:57.600 align:start position:0%
order raised i don't know what that
 
05:14:59.190 --> 05:14:59.200 align:start position:0%
point of order is
 
05:15:00.150 --> 05:15:00.160 align:start position:0%
does the representative still have a
 
05:15:02.230 --> 05:15:02.240 align:start position:0%
point of order
 
05:15:03.510 --> 05:15:03.520 align:start position:0%
respectfully mr chairman you're
 
05:15:08.150 --> 05:15:08.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:10.150 --> 05:15:10.160 align:start position:0%
i i would like to say
 
05:15:12.390 --> 05:15:12.400 align:start position:0%
that we were talking about
 
05:15:14.708 --> 05:15:14.718 align:start position:0%
the feelings
 
05:15:16.948 --> 05:15:16.958 align:start position:0%
of somebody who was who was going to
 
05:15:19.110 --> 05:15:19.120 align:start position:0%
kill somebody else
 
05:15:21.990 --> 05:15:22.000 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to want to find out
 
05:15:24.150 --> 05:15:24.160 align:start position:0%
you know what the feelings were
 
05:15:25.750 --> 05:15:25.760 align:start position:0%
of the
 
05:15:28.150 --> 05:15:28.160 align:start position:0%
the person offering testimony when it
 
05:15:31.110 --> 05:15:31.120 align:start position:0%
came to taking the life of the unborn
 
05:15:31.120 --> 05:15:34.070 align:start position:0%
came to taking the life of the unborn
engine

05:15:34.070 --> 05:15:34.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:36.310 --> 05:15:36.320 align:start position:0%
representative i i understood the
 
05:15:38.070 --> 05:15:38.080 align:start position:0%
question that yes i just i don't feel
 
05:15:39.590 --> 05:15:39.600 align:start position:0%
like that
 
05:15:40.868 --> 05:15:40.878 align:start position:0%
that topic
 
05:15:42.788 --> 05:15:42.798 align:start position:0%
and i understand the
 
05:15:44.788 --> 05:15:44.798 align:start position:0%
analogy i just i don't think the purpose
 
05:15:46.390 --> 05:15:46.400 align:start position:0%
of this build
 
05:15:47.910 --> 05:15:47.920 align:start position:0%
you talk about
 
05:15:50.948 --> 05:15:50.958 align:start position:0%
get into that subject okay
 
05:15:59.670 --> 05:15:59.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:03.430 --> 05:16:03.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:05.110 --> 05:16:05.120 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman i have a quick
 
05:16:07.350 --> 05:16:07.360 align:start position:0%
question do you feel that
 
05:16:09.350 --> 05:16:09.360 align:start position:0%
for the witness and thank you
 
05:16:11.670 --> 05:16:11.680 align:start position:0%
for your testimony
 
05:16:13.990 --> 05:16:14.000 align:start position:0%
do you feel that
 
05:16:17.670 --> 05:16:17.680 align:start position:0%
a person who is observing a crime
 
05:16:19.910 --> 05:16:19.920 align:start position:0%
that they think they have the right now
 
05:16:22.390 --> 05:16:22.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:23.910 --> 05:16:23.920 align:start position:0%
deadly force
 
05:16:25.830 --> 05:16:25.840 align:start position:0%
can tell the difference
 
05:16:28.390 --> 05:16:28.400 align:start position:0%
between if that crime is a misdemeanor
 
05:16:30.070 --> 05:16:30.080 align:start position:0%
or felony
 
05:16:39.030 --> 05:16:39.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:41.110 --> 05:16:41.120 align:start position:0%
um i think that
 
05:16:43.110 --> 05:16:43.120 align:start position:0%
most people
 
05:16:45.510 --> 05:16:45.520 align:start position:0%
in the general public would not have any
 
05:16:48.230 --> 05:16:48.240 align:start position:0%
such categories in their mind
 
05:16:49.670 --> 05:16:49.680 align:start position:0%
about what's a felony and what's a
 
05:16:49.680 --> 05:16:52.470 align:start position:0%
about what's a felony and what's a
misdemeanor

05:16:52.470 --> 05:16:52.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:56.550 --> 05:16:56.560 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:58.150 --> 05:16:58.160 align:start position:0%
representative marston
 
05:17:00.310 --> 05:17:00.320 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you for
 
05:17:03.190 --> 05:17:03.200 align:start position:0%
taking out my question
 
05:17:05.270 --> 05:17:05.280 align:start position:0%
i'd like to point out that the final
 
05:17:06.550 --> 05:17:06.560 align:start position:0%
part of this
 
05:17:10.230 --> 05:17:10.240 align:start position:0%
bill is talking about
 
05:17:13.110 --> 05:17:13.120 align:start position:0%
somebody acting in somebody else's
 
05:17:13.120 --> 05:17:14.470 align:start position:0%
somebody acting in somebody else's
dwelling

05:17:14.470 --> 05:17:14.480 align:start position:0%
dwelling
 
05:17:16.150 --> 05:17:16.160 align:start position:0%
or cartilage
 
05:17:18.150 --> 05:17:18.160 align:start position:0%
and kind of get a kick out of that word
 
05:17:20.470 --> 05:17:20.480 align:start position:0%
but matter when somebody's trying to get
 
05:17:22.628 --> 05:17:22.638 align:start position:0%
into your house
 
05:17:24.150 --> 05:17:24.160 align:start position:0%
and your
 
05:17:26.230 --> 05:17:26.240 align:start position:0%
life is possibly threatened and you're
 
05:17:28.708 --> 05:17:28.718 align:start position:0%
saying you don't want to be able to use
 
05:17:30.868 --> 05:17:30.878 align:start position:0%
force to stop them
 
05:17:38.628 --> 05:17:38.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:41.510 --> 05:17:41.520 align:start position:0%
you're you're asking me if i if i want
 
05:17:43.030 --> 05:17:43.040 align:start position:0%
to be able to shoot someone if someone's
 
05:17:44.550 --> 05:17:44.560 align:start position:0%
breaking into my house is that what
 
05:17:45.830 --> 05:17:45.840 align:start position:0%
you're asking me
 
05:17:45.840 --> 05:17:46.788 align:start position:0%
you're asking me
correct

05:17:46.788 --> 05:17:46.798 align:start position:0%
correct
 
05:17:48.150 --> 05:17:48.160 align:start position:0%
i do not want to shoot someone if
 
05:17:58.708 --> 05:17:58.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:00.628 --> 05:18:00.638 align:start position:0%
seeing no further questions questions i
 
05:18:12.230 --> 05:18:12.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:18.470 --> 05:18:18.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:20.708 --> 05:18:20.718 align:start position:0%
can you hear me
 
05:18:20.718 --> 05:18:21.990 align:start position:0%
can you hear me
yes

05:18:21.990 --> 05:18:22.000 align:start position:0%
yes
 
05:18:24.628 --> 05:18:24.638 align:start position:0%
okay i'm bill kingston from newcastle
 
05:18:26.310 --> 05:18:26.320 align:start position:0%
and i'm speaking for myself in
 
05:18:28.390 --> 05:18:28.400 align:start position:0%
opposition to this bill
 
05:18:29.990 --> 05:18:30.000 align:start position:0%
i'm a gun owner and a marine corps
 
05:18:32.390 --> 05:18:32.400 align:start position:0%
veteran with combat experience and i've
 
05:18:34.708 --> 05:18:34.718 align:start position:0%
been in deadly situations
 
05:18:36.708 --> 05:18:36.718 align:start position:0%
and you will also recall that i sent all
 
05:18:38.390 --> 05:18:38.400 align:start position:0%
of you the report from the american bar
 
05:18:41.990 --> 05:18:42.000 align:start position:0%
association on stand your ground laws
 
05:18:44.788 --> 05:18:44.798 align:start position:0%
in the opening sentence of this proposal
 
05:18:46.550 --> 05:18:46.560 align:start position:0%
the author wishes to insert the word
 
05:18:49.190 --> 05:18:49.200 align:start position:0%
duty into the right of self-defense
 
05:18:51.030 --> 05:18:51.040 align:start position:0%
now this is a radical departure from all
 
05:18:52.948 --> 05:18:52.958 align:start position:0%
previous statutes and court decisions
 
05:18:55.670 --> 05:18:55.680 align:start position:0%
and it is not the new hampshire way the
 
05:18:57.190 --> 05:18:57.200 align:start position:0%
right of self-defense is one of the
 
05:18:58.948 --> 05:18:58.958 align:start position:0%
basic principles of every civilized
 
05:19:01.990 --> 05:19:02.000 align:start position:0%
society this one word strives to change
 
05:19:04.230 --> 05:19:04.240 align:start position:0%
that and will have enormous impact on
 
05:19:06.230 --> 05:19:06.240 align:start position:0%
the people of new hampshire
 
05:19:07.510 --> 05:19:07.520 align:start position:0%
article two of the new hampshire
 
05:19:09.590 --> 05:19:09.600 align:start position:0%
constitution guarantees our natural
 
05:19:09.600 --> 05:19:10.628 align:start position:0%
constitution guarantees our natural
rights

05:19:10.628 --> 05:19:10.638 align:start position:0%
rights
 
05:19:12.230 --> 05:19:12.240 align:start position:0%
it specifically mentions the right to
 
05:19:14.310 --> 05:19:14.320 align:start position:0%
defend oneself and then immediately
 
05:19:16.390 --> 05:19:16.400 align:start position:0%
spells out the right to seeking and
 
05:19:18.948 --> 05:19:18.958 align:start position:0%
obtaining happiness it further goes on
 
05:19:21.190 --> 05:19:21.200 align:start position:0%
to say equality of rights under the law
 
05:19:23.830 --> 05:19:23.840 align:start position:0%
shall not be decided denied or abridged
 
05:19:26.070 --> 05:19:26.080 align:start position:0%
by this state on account of race creed

color sex or national origin
 
05:19:30.868 --> 05:19:30.878 align:start position:0%
what i'm getting at here
 
05:19:32.550 --> 05:19:32.560 align:start position:0%
is we should not make the same mistake
 
05:19:34.788 --> 05:19:34.798 align:start position:0%
as florida when they adopted stand your
 
05:19:36.788 --> 05:19:36.798 align:start position:0%
ground legislation
 
05:19:38.708 --> 05:19:38.718 align:start position:0%
a person of color has the right to walk
 
05:19:40.708 --> 05:19:40.718 align:start position:0%
through my white neighborhood
 
05:19:42.550 --> 05:19:42.560 align:start position:0%
his presence should not be a point of
 
05:19:44.708 --> 05:19:44.718 align:start position:0%
contention or fear
 
05:19:46.948 --> 05:19:46.958 align:start position:0%
we do not need a trayvon martin case in
 
05:19:49.430 --> 05:19:49.440 align:start position:0%
new hampshire please do not tell me it
 
05:19:51.030 --> 05:19:51.040 align:start position:0%
cannot happen
 
05:19:52.708 --> 05:19:52.718 align:start position:0%
i hear it from a few of my own neighbors
 
05:19:54.150 --> 05:19:54.160 align:start position:0%
whenever a black person is in the
 
05:19:55.990 --> 05:19:56.000 align:start position:0%
neighborhood what is that black kid
 
05:19:58.470 --> 05:19:58.480 align:start position:0%
doing in this neighborhood
 
05:20:01.670 --> 05:20:01.680 align:start position:0%
do we really want to invite this excuse
 
05:20:04.628 --> 05:20:04.638 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry officer i thought he had a gun
 
05:20:07.990 --> 05:20:08.000 align:start position:0%
i was only doing my duty
 
05:20:10.150 --> 05:20:10.160 align:start position:0%
we should never insert duty into the
 
05:20:12.550 --> 05:20:12.560 align:start position:0%
definition of self-defense this is only
 
05:20:14.628 --> 05:20:14.638 align:start position:0%
an invitation for the bad actors to use
 
05:20:16.310 --> 05:20:16.320 align:start position:0%
deadly force
 
05:20:18.708 --> 05:20:18.718 align:start position:0%
this duty thing flies in the face of
 
05:20:20.550 --> 05:20:20.560 align:start position:0%
every legal precedent that requires us
 
05:20:23.590 --> 05:20:23.600 align:start position:0%
to act responsibly and use good judgment
 
05:20:25.990 --> 05:20:26.000 align:start position:0%
with proportionate restraint
 
05:20:27.830 --> 05:20:27.840 align:start position:0%
since it is contrary to article 2 i
 
05:20:30.150 --> 05:20:30.160 align:start position:0%
believe it is also unconstitutional
 
05:20:32.390 --> 05:20:32.400 align:start position:0%
therefore ladies and gentlemen i urge
 
05:20:34.708 --> 05:20:34.718 align:start position:0%
you to reject reject this fundamental
 
05:20:36.470 --> 05:20:36.480 align:start position:0%
and radical change to our laws here in
 
05:20:47.430 --> 05:20:47.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:49.510 --> 05:20:49.520 align:start position:0%

thank you for taking my question um
 
05:21:25.110 --> 05:21:25.120 align:start position:0%
you testified on the whole
 
05:21:28.390 --> 05:21:28.400 align:start position:0%
all the verbage that was in the bill
 
05:21:31.590 --> 05:21:31.600 align:start position:0%
that much of it was is is there today in
 
05:21:33.990 --> 05:21:34.000 align:start position:0%
the statute the only change that we're
 
05:21:34.000 --> 05:21:34.948 align:start position:0%
the statute the only change that we're
making

05:21:34.948 --> 05:21:34.958 align:start position:0%
making
 
05:21:36.708 --> 05:21:36.718 align:start position:0%
is what you will see
 
05:21:39.510 --> 05:21:39.520 align:start position:0%
in italics down in
 
05:21:40.788 --> 05:21:40.798 align:start position:0%
line 10
 
05:21:42.390 --> 05:21:42.400 align:start position:0%
section 2d
 
05:21:45.670 --> 05:21:45.680 align:start position:0%
and we're adding the fact that they
 
05:21:47.030 --> 05:21:47.040 align:start position:0%
the situation
 
05:21:49.270 --> 05:21:49.280 align:start position:0%
let's say could arise where
 
05:21:51.350 --> 05:21:51.360 align:start position:0%
you were defending yourself
 
05:21:53.430 --> 05:21:53.440 align:start position:0%
but you couldn't defend
 
05:21:55.030 --> 05:21:55.040 align:start position:0%
somebody else that was there like your
 
05:21:55.040 --> 05:21:55.910 align:start position:0%
somebody else that was there like your
wife

05:21:55.910 --> 05:21:55.920 align:start position:0%
wife
 
05:21:57.990 --> 05:21:58.000 align:start position:0%
all this had is
 
05:22:01.910 --> 05:22:01.920 align:start position:0%
two words or another because we forgot
 
05:22:03.990 --> 05:22:04.000 align:start position:0%
it when we did it last time so this
 
05:22:04.000 --> 05:22:04.948 align:start position:0%
it when we did it last time so this
isn't

05:22:04.948 --> 05:22:04.958 align:start position:0%
isn't
 
05:22:07.750 --> 05:22:07.760 align:start position:0%
the whole bill isn't an issue it's just
 
05:22:09.030 --> 05:22:09.040 align:start position:0%
two words
 
05:22:14.708 --> 05:22:14.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:15.830 --> 05:22:15.840 align:start position:0%
oh yes sir
 
05:22:17.190 --> 05:22:17.200 align:start position:0%
i'm aware of that
 
05:22:19.510 --> 05:22:19.520 align:start position:0%
uh however i'm objecting to the
 
05:22:20.708 --> 05:22:20.718 align:start position:0%
insertion of
 
05:22:23.030 --> 05:22:23.040 align:start position:0%
changing uh
 
05:22:26.470 --> 05:22:26.480 align:start position:0%
the tone of uh self-defense and and
 
05:22:29.030 --> 05:22:29.040 align:start position:0%
making self-defense a duty rather than a
 
05:22:31.510 --> 05:22:31.520 align:start position:0%
a necessity
 
05:22:44.150 --> 05:22:44.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:46.070 --> 05:22:46.080 align:start position:0%
representative marston thank you mr
 
05:22:47.910 --> 05:22:47.920 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking our
 
05:22:47.920 --> 05:22:50.230 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking our
questions

05:22:50.230 --> 05:22:50.240 align:start position:0%
questions
 
05:22:52.948 --> 05:22:52.958 align:start position:0%
i'm confused by your statements that you
 
05:22:54.230 --> 05:22:54.240 align:start position:0%
ran through
 
05:22:57.110 --> 05:22:57.120 align:start position:0%
and i'm just wondering generally you are
 
05:22:59.670 --> 05:22:59.680 align:start position:0%
against self-defending yourself
 
05:22:59.680 --> 05:23:02.868 align:start position:0%
against self-defending yourself
self-defense

05:23:02.868 --> 05:23:02.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:06.390 --> 05:23:06.400 align:start position:0%
oh no that's the that's an absurd uh
 
05:23:07.670 --> 05:23:07.680 align:start position:0%
that's an absurd
 
05:23:09.350 --> 05:23:09.360 align:start position:0%
interpretation of what of what i'm
 
05:23:10.628 --> 05:23:10.638 align:start position:0%
trying to say here
 
05:23:14.310 --> 05:23:14.320 align:start position:0%
uh everyone has a right of self defense
 
05:23:16.708 --> 05:23:16.718 align:start position:0%
i'm just saying that self defense should
 
05:23:18.868 --> 05:23:18.878 align:start position:0%
not be made duty
 
05:23:20.070 --> 05:23:20.080 align:start position:0%
because that
 
05:23:22.708 --> 05:23:22.718 align:start position:0%
leads to vigilantism which is not the
 
05:23:24.550 --> 05:23:24.560 align:start position:0%
new hampshire way and it is never
 
05:23:29.670 --> 05:23:29.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:29.680 --> 05:23:30.470 align:start position:0%
 
just

05:23:30.470 --> 05:23:30.480 align:start position:0%
just
 
05:23:32.070 --> 05:23:32.080 align:start position:0%
before i go with
 
05:23:33.430 --> 05:23:33.440 align:start position:0%
representative martin for a follow-up i
 
05:23:34.390 --> 05:23:34.400 align:start position:0%
just want to
 
05:23:35.590 --> 05:23:35.600 align:start position:0%
address when
 
05:23:37.590 --> 05:23:37.600 align:start position:0%
the members of the the committee ask a
 
05:23:39.190 --> 05:23:39.200 align:start position:0%
question of any member of the public
 
05:23:39.200 --> 05:23:40.628 align:start position:0%
question of any member of the public
testifying

05:23:40.628 --> 05:23:40.638 align:start position:0%
testifying
 
05:23:42.628 --> 05:23:42.638 align:start position:0%
it's supposed to be done with the intent
 
05:23:44.788 --> 05:23:44.798 align:start position:0%
to gather information
 
05:23:47.030 --> 05:23:47.040 align:start position:0%
either about about their testimony they
 
05:23:49.750 --> 05:23:49.760 align:start position:0%
provided or about the bill itself but we
 
05:23:50.708 --> 05:23:50.718 align:start position:0%
don't really
 
05:23:51.910 --> 05:23:51.920 align:start position:0%
we're not supposed to really engage in
 
05:23:54.150 --> 05:23:54.160 align:start position:0%
debate style questions i'm just saying
 
05:23:55.350 --> 05:23:55.360 align:start position:0%
we're getting a little close to that
 
05:23:57.350 --> 05:23:57.360 align:start position:0%
with some of the questions so let's just
 
05:24:00.230 --> 05:24:00.240 align:start position:0%
be mindful of that just to remind them
 
05:24:01.910 --> 05:24:01.920 align:start position:0%
representative mark martin follow the
 
05:24:01.920 --> 05:24:06.150 align:start position:0%

or she is not required to retreat
 
05:24:31.750 --> 05:24:31.760 align:start position:0%

05:26:49.760 --> 05:26:51.670 align:start position:0%
chairman of the committee this year
congratulations

05:26:51.670 --> 05:26:51.680 align:start position:0%
congratulations
 
05:26:53.910 --> 05:26:53.920 align:start position:0%
um i come before you today in opposition
 
05:26:56.628 --> 05:26:56.638 align:start position:0%
to house bill 81 a bill that permits the
 
05:26:58.390 --> 05:26:58.400 align:start position:0%
use of deadly force in defense of
 
05:26:59.990 --> 05:27:00.000 align:start position:0%
another person
 
05:27:01.670 --> 05:27:01.680 align:start position:0%
the bill is better known in popular
 
05:27:04.470 --> 05:27:04.480 align:start position:0%
nomenclature as a stand your ground law
 
05:27:08.070 --> 05:27:08.080 align:start position:0%
otherwise known by some as kill at will
 
05:27:09.910 --> 05:27:09.920 align:start position:0%
and it does nothing more than to justify
 
05:27:11.910 --> 05:27:11.920 align:start position:0%
murder in the defense of another
 
05:27:13.910 --> 05:27:13.920 align:start position:0%
new hampshire already has a so-called
 
05:27:15.430 --> 05:27:15.440 align:start position:0%
stand your ground law
 
05:27:17.350 --> 05:27:17.360 align:start position:0%
giving people a license to kill when
 
05:27:19.430 --> 05:27:19.440 align:start position:0%
confronted with a perceived threat
 
05:27:22.230 --> 05:27:22.240 align:start position:0%
without even considering walking away or
 
05:27:24.390 --> 05:27:24.400 align:start position:0%
de-escalating the situation
 
05:27:26.230 --> 05:27:26.240 align:start position:0%
and today the committee is faced with a
 
05:27:28.628 --> 05:27:28.638 align:start position:0%
series of proposed bills that attempt to
 
05:27:31.590 --> 05:27:31.600 align:start position:0%
make this dangerous law even more deadly
 
05:27:34.070 --> 05:27:34.080 align:start position:0%
house bill 81 would expand the use of
 
05:27:36.310 --> 05:27:36.320 align:start position:0%
deadly force in defense of another it
 
05:27:39.590 --> 05:27:39.600 align:start position:0%
would embolden reckless gun unioners to
 
05:27:42.230 --> 05:27:42.240 align:start position:0%
shoot first and ask questions later and
 
05:27:43.750 --> 05:27:43.760 align:start position:0%
claim defense of another to avoid
 
05:27:45.750 --> 05:27:45.760 align:start position:0%
culpability for murder
 
05:27:47.510 --> 05:27:47.520 align:start position:0%
time murder legal principles and
 
05:27:49.830 --> 05:27:49.840 align:start position:0%
codified self-defense laws across the
 
05:27:51.910 --> 05:27:51.920 align:start position:0%
united states have long affirmed
 
05:27:54.470 --> 05:27:54.480 align:start position:0%
people's right to use proportionate
 
05:27:57.110 --> 05:27:57.120 align:start position:0%
physical force to defend themselves and
 
05:27:59.430 --> 05:27:59.440 align:start position:0%
others against imminent violence
 
05:28:01.750 --> 05:28:01.760 align:start position:0%
self-defense laws in the united states
 
05:28:04.310 --> 05:28:04.320 align:start position:0%
also typically justify a person's use of
 
05:28:06.948 --> 05:28:06.958 align:start position:0%
lethal force in situations where it's
 
05:28:09.750 --> 05:28:09.760 align:start position:0%
reasonable for a person to believe that
 
05:28:12.070 --> 05:28:12.080 align:start position:0%
lethal force was necessary to prevent
 
05:28:14.868 --> 05:28:14.878 align:start position:0%
imminent death or serious bodily imagery
 
05:28:17.030 --> 05:28:17.040 align:start position:0%
to themselves or another person
 
05:28:19.910 --> 05:28:19.920 align:start position:0%
traditionally these laws have been clear
 
05:28:22.708 --> 05:28:22.718 align:start position:0%
that taping human life is not necessary
 
05:28:25.030 --> 05:28:25.040 align:start position:0%
and is therefore not justified if the
 
05:28:27.430 --> 05:28:27.440 align:start position:0%
person could have avoided using that
 
05:28:30.230 --> 05:28:30.240 align:start position:0%
lethal violence by retreating or simply
 
05:28:32.708 --> 05:28:32.718 align:start position:0%
stepping away from a confrontation
 
05:28:34.948 --> 05:28:34.958 align:start position:0%
in most u.s jurisdictions court
 
05:28:37.350 --> 05:28:37.360 align:start position:0%
precedents and or state laws have carved
 
05:28:38.948 --> 05:28:38.958 align:start position:0%
out an exception to this duty to
 
05:28:41.510 --> 05:28:41.520 align:start position:0%
de-escalate or retreat called castle
 
05:28:41.520 --> 05:28:42.708 align:start position:0%
de-escalate or retreat called castle
doctrine

05:28:42.708 --> 05:28:42.718 align:start position:0%
doctrine
 
05:28:44.230 --> 05:28:44.240 align:start position:0%
on the theory that a person's home is
 
05:28:46.708 --> 05:28:46.718 align:start position:0%
their castle this legal principle has
 
05:28:49.110 --> 05:28:49.120 align:start position:0%
traditionally created a rebuttable legal
 
05:28:50.868 --> 05:28:50.878 align:start position:0%
presumption that individuals are
 
05:28:53.350 --> 05:28:53.360 align:start position:0%
justified in using force against some
 
05:28:55.430 --> 05:28:55.440 align:start position:0%
fun unlawfully breaking into their
 
05:28:56.788 --> 05:28:56.798 align:start position:0%
occupied home
 
05:28:58.708 --> 05:28:58.718 align:start position:0%
without having to consider options such
 
05:29:00.788 --> 05:29:00.798 align:start position:0%
as leaving the home to avoid a threat or
 
05:29:00.798 --> 05:29:02.390 align:start position:0%
as leaving the home to avoid a threat or
confrontation

05:29:02.390 --> 05:29:02.400 align:start position:0%
confrontation
 
05:29:05.270 --> 05:29:05.280 align:start position:0%
stand your ground laws abandon centuries
 
05:29:06.948 --> 05:29:06.958 align:start position:0%
of legal
 
05:29:09.910 --> 05:29:09.920 align:start position:0%
representative rogers i i i
 
05:29:11.990 --> 05:29:12.000 align:start position:0%
i have to interrupt i do need to limit
 
05:29:14.948 --> 05:29:14.958 align:start position:0%
testimony to two minutes per witness so
 
05:29:16.788 --> 05:29:16.798 align:start position:0%
if you don't mind bringing your
 
05:29:21.910 --> 05:29:21.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:23.430 --> 05:29:23.440 align:start position:0%
one file
 
05:29:26.788 --> 05:29:26.798 align:start position:0%
other than just the legal principles
 
05:29:28.628 --> 05:29:28.638 align:start position:0%
if you don't believe that the unknowing
 
05:29:31.110 --> 05:29:31.120 align:start position:0%
public could be inadvertently affected
 
05:29:33.270 --> 05:29:33.280 align:start position:0%
by the the violence
 
05:29:36.390 --> 05:29:36.400 align:start position:0%
and the classical death on house bill 21
 
05:29:38.070 --> 05:29:38.080 align:start position:0%
i would ask you to look to the cost of
 
05:29:40.070 --> 05:29:40.080 align:start position:0%
property taxpayers to this piece of
 
05:29:40.080 --> 05:29:41.670 align:start position:0%
property taxpayers to this piece of
legislation

05:29:41.670 --> 05:29:41.680 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
05:29:44.708 --> 05:29:44.718 align:start position:0%
the police now always have to be suspect
 
05:29:46.868 --> 05:29:46.878 align:start position:0%
if this passes to every citizen if
 
05:29:49.110 --> 05:29:49.120 align:start position:0%
they're armed and if they need more
 
05:29:51.990 --> 05:29:52.000 align:start position:0%
security to understand the ground laws
 
05:29:54.150 --> 05:29:54.160 align:start position:0%
do a police have to be have more police
 
05:29:56.070 --> 05:29:56.080 align:start position:0%
on the beat do we have to worry that if
 
05:29:59.910 --> 05:29:59.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:02.150 --> 05:30:02.160 align:start position:0%
representative we uh we have we're on
 
05:30:04.150 --> 05:30:04.160 align:start position:0%
where i say our committee is on a time

where i say our committee is on a time
crunch

05:30:06.310 --> 05:30:06.320 align:start position:0%
crunch
 
05:30:08.470 --> 05:30:08.480 align:start position:0%
that's an understatement i i don't need
 
05:30:12.788 --> 05:30:12.798 align:start position:0%
to interrupt i get but i do have to uh

i i hope wait a few minutes
 
05:32:01.670 --> 05:32:01.680 align:start position:0%
i'll be as brief as i can because i'm
 
05:32:03.750 --> 05:32:03.760 align:start position:0%
actually going to
 
05:32:06.070 --> 05:32:06.080 align:start position:0%
save my testimony for the other two
 
05:32:09.350 --> 05:32:09.360 align:start position:0%
bills that follow
 
05:32:11.830 --> 05:32:11.840 align:start position:0%
what i do want to say though is that i
 
05:32:13.990 --> 05:32:14.000 align:start position:0%
oppose any
 
05:32:17.910 --> 05:32:17.920 align:start position:0%
wording that expands stand your ground
 
05:32:20.070 --> 05:32:20.080 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire
 
05:32:22.628 --> 05:32:22.638 align:start position:0%
i want to i should start by saying i've
 
05:32:24.788 --> 05:32:24.798 align:start position:0%
been i was born and raised in new
 
05:32:24.798 --> 05:32:25.990 align:start position:0%
been i was born and raised in new
hampshire

05:32:25.990 --> 05:32:26.000 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
05:32:28.948 --> 05:32:28.958 align:start position:0%
and i don't remember in new hampshire
 
05:32:31.190 --> 05:32:31.200 align:start position:0%
when i grew up here about a lot of
 
05:32:32.708 --> 05:32:32.718 align:start position:0%
people owning
 
05:32:36.708 --> 05:32:36.718 align:start position:0%
guns so i am definitely against
 
05:32:40.788 --> 05:32:40.798 align:start position:0%
uh this bill hb81
 
05:32:43.670 --> 05:32:43.680 align:start position:0%
my i want to add one more thing
 
05:32:45.430 --> 05:32:45.440 align:start position:0%
um at the
 
05:32:48.070 --> 05:32:48.080 align:start position:0%
the unitarian minister
 
05:32:50.628 --> 05:32:50.638 align:start position:0%
expressed very beautifully what my
 
05:32:52.868 --> 05:32:52.878 align:start position:0%
sentiments are
 
05:32:55.590 --> 05:32:55.600 align:start position:0%
and i wish we didn't have to have this
 
05:32:57.548 --> 05:32:57.558 align:start position:0%
kind of a
 
05:33:00.470 --> 05:33:00.480 align:start position:0%
adversarial process i think what we're
 
05:33:00.480 --> 05:33:01.510 align:start position:0%
adversarial process i think what we're
missing

05:33:01.510 --> 05:33:01.520 align:start position:0%
missing
 
05:33:04.548 --> 05:33:04.558 align:start position:0%
is an opportunity for people to sit down
 
05:33:08.390 --> 05:33:08.400 align:start position:0%
with each other and really try to listen
 
05:33:10.628 --> 05:33:10.638 align:start position:0%
i would like to understand where
 
05:33:14.150 --> 05:33:14.160 align:start position:0%
representative al baldassaro is coming
 
05:33:14.160 --> 05:33:15.350 align:start position:0%
representative al baldassaro is coming
from

05:33:15.350 --> 05:33:15.360 align:start position:0%
from
 
05:33:18.548 --> 05:33:18.558 align:start position:0%
and why he has such strong feelings
 
05:33:21.670 --> 05:33:21.680 align:start position:0%
about his right to carry arms
 
05:33:24.868 --> 05:33:24.878 align:start position:0%
and i would like to have an opportunity
 
05:33:27.510 --> 05:33:27.520 align:start position:0%
not just to be speaking for a bill but
 
05:33:27.520 --> 05:33:28.470 align:start position:0%
not just to be speaking for a bill but
to

05:33:28.470 --> 05:33:28.480 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:33:32.070 --> 05:33:32.080 align:start position:0%
to promote and to try to get um
 
05:33:35.030 --> 05:33:35.040 align:start position:0%
better understanding as opposed to
 
05:33:39.110 --> 05:33:39.120 align:start position:0%
throwing out uh names like liberals and
 
05:33:42.788 --> 05:33:42.798 align:start position:0%
um antifa and things like that so i will
 
05:33:45.110 --> 05:33:45.120 align:start position:0%

levels of complexity that are really not
 
05:35:38.230 --> 05:35:38.240 align:start position:0%

about value human life those who own and
 
05:36:33.510 --> 05:36:33.520 align:start position:0%

05:36:35.990 --> 05:36:36.000 align:start position:0%

we really don't want to shoot anybody
 
05:36:45.030 --> 05:36:45.040 align:start position:0%
but we do want to retain the ability to
 
05:36:48.310 --> 05:36:48.320 align:start position:0%
stop a violent criminal assault and a
 
05:36:50.628 --> 05:36:50.638 align:start position:0%
home invasion is about as violent as
 
05:36:52.390 --> 05:36:52.400 align:start position:0%
you're going to get
 
05:36:53.750 --> 05:36:53.760 align:start position:0%
and therefore
 
05:36:55.910 --> 05:36:55.920 align:start position:0%

innocent populations that already get
 
05:39:55.670 --> 05:39:55.680 align:start position:0%

05:39:57.910 --> 05:39:57.920 align:start position:0%
allow people to harm these already

it is unreasonable that victims of crime
 
05:43:23.910 --> 05:43:23.920 align:start position:0%
should have to worry about being
 
05:43:26.470 --> 05:43:26.480 align:start position:0%

themselves or their loved ones any
 
05:43:32.070 --> 05:43:32.080 align:start position:0%
victim should be able to presume that an

unlawful attacker especially in their

self-defense law house bill 81 is a
 
05:43:47.350 --> 05:43:47.360 align:start position:0%
common sense clarification in the law
 
05:43:49.590 --> 05:43:49.600 align:start position:0%
all it's doing is making sure that
 
05:43:51.990 --> 05:43:52.000 align:start position:0%
people know if someone is unlawfully
 
05:43:53.670 --> 05:43:53.680 align:start position:0%

um poses the threat
 
05:44:06.708 --> 05:44:06.718 align:start position:0%
courts have consistently ruled that one
 
05:44:08.708 --> 05:44:08.718 align:start position:0%
might not attack and are not required to
 
05:44:11.110 --> 05:44:11.120 align:start position:0%

confusion about uh what this bill really

does this is mostly a clerical and
 
05:46:13.830 --> 05:46:13.840 align:start position:0%
bookkeeping bill this does not expand
 
05:46:15.910 --> 05:46:15.920 align:start position:0%
stand your ground in any ways it doesn't
 
05:46:17.510 --> 05:46:17.520 align:start position:0%
change the standard ground statute which
 
05:46:20.310 --> 05:46:20.320 align:start position:0%
is 627 for
 
05:46:22.150 --> 05:46:22.160 align:start position:0%
roman numeral 3
 
05:46:25.110 --> 05:46:25.120 align:start position:0%
section a this has to do with
 
05:46:27.590 --> 05:46:27.600 align:start position:0%
section roman numeral 2 section d
 
05:46:31.590 --> 05:46:31.600 align:start position:0%
and all it does is change add the word
 
05:46:31.600 --> 05:46:32.548 align:start position:0%
and all it does is change add the word
another

05:46:32.548 --> 05:46:32.558 align:start position:0%
another
 
05:46:34.230 --> 05:46:34.240 align:start position:0%
after the word actor
 
05:46:37.270 --> 05:46:37.280 align:start position:0%
in section a we have the actor or a
 
05:46:39.830 --> 05:46:39.840 align:start position:0%
third person in section b we have
 
05:46:42.868 --> 05:46:42.878 align:start position:0%
uh against a person present
 
05:46:44.390 --> 05:46:44.400 align:start position:0%
in section c
 
05:46:46.628 --> 05:46:46.638 align:start position:0%
um it says about to commit kidnapping or
 
05:46:48.470 --> 05:46:48.480 align:start position:0%
forcible sex offense and then finally
 
05:46:50.708 --> 05:46:50.718 align:start position:0%
when it gets to d it says the actor in
 
05:46:53.590 --> 05:46:53.600 align:start position:0%
their to and within such actors dwelling
 
05:46:55.190 --> 05:46:55.200 align:start position:0%
or curtilage this is not something that
 
05:46:57.190 --> 05:46:57.200 align:start position:0%
applies to someone who is outside in the
 
05:46:58.708 --> 05:46:58.718 align:start position:0%
general public this is someone within
 
05:47:00.788 --> 05:47:00.798 align:start position:0%
their own home having the ability to
 
05:47:03.190 --> 05:47:03.200 align:start position:0%
protect not just themselves but it's
 
05:47:06.868 --> 05:47:06.878 align:start position:0%
adding another person in that section
 
05:47:09.990 --> 05:47:10.000 align:start position:0%
so it's a very clear uh very narrow
 
05:47:12.708 --> 05:47:12.718 align:start position:0%
change to the law and i think it is uh
 
05:47:14.230 --> 05:47:14.240 align:start position:0%
it was overlooked probably in the
 
05:47:16.390 --> 05:47:16.400 align:start position:0%
initial drafting of this legislation and
 
05:47:18.150 --> 05:47:18.160 align:start position:0%
it just needs to be fixed
 
05:47:23.830 --> 05:47:23.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:25.990 --> 05:47:26.000 align:start position:0%

05:49:07.110 --> 05:49:07.120 align:start position:0%
all right am i ready yes
 
05:49:08.948 --> 05:49:08.958 align:start position:0%
okay under the gun
 
05:49:11.350 --> 05:49:11.360 align:start position:0%
uh i introduced this bill last session
 
05:49:14.628 --> 05:49:14.638 align:start position:0%
as house bill 208 the the same wording
 
05:49:17.110 --> 05:49:17.120 align:start position:0%
it just adds the words or another this
 
05:49:18.708 --> 05:49:18.718 align:start position:0%
is not a stand your ground law it's a
 
05:49:20.628 --> 05:49:20.638 align:start position:0%
typo correction
 
05:49:22.390 --> 05:49:22.400 align:start position:0%
and i have to admit i'm not the one who
 
05:49:24.150 --> 05:49:24.160 align:start position:0%
found it it was actually while doing the
 
05:49:26.070 --> 05:49:26.080 align:start position:0%
research in my self-defense case it was
 
05:49:28.628 --> 05:49:28.638 align:start position:0%
uh judge delker so if anyone gets credit
 
05:49:31.910 --> 05:49:31.920 align:start position:0%
for finding the typo it should go to him
 
05:49:33.830 --> 05:49:33.840 align:start position:0%
in response to representative bradley's
 
05:49:36.150 --> 05:49:36.160 align:start position:0%
question there are many felonies in rsa
 
05:49:38.628 --> 05:49:38.638 align:start position:0%
631 and 633
 
05:49:40.470 --> 05:49:40.480 align:start position:0%
that are not
 
05:49:42.548 --> 05:49:42.558 align:start position:0%
necessarily defined as deadly force
 
05:49:44.470 --> 05:49:44.480 align:start position:0%
deadly force is a real gray area in the
 
05:49:46.070 --> 05:49:46.080 align:start position:0%
law and that's something i've asked this
 
05:49:50.390 --> 05:49:50.400 align:start position:0%
committee to address in the past
 
05:49:50.400 --> 05:49:52.070 align:start position:0%
committee to address in the past
but

05:49:52.070 --> 05:49:52.080 align:start position:0%
but
 
05:49:54.150 --> 05:49:54.160 align:start position:0%
it simply says
 
05:49:55.990 --> 05:49:56.000 align:start position:0%
so stand your ground would be you have
 
05:49:57.910 --> 05:49:57.920 align:start position:0%
to stand there
 
05:49:59.750 --> 05:49:59.760 align:start position:0%
for sorry before standing around there
 
05:50:01.190 --> 05:50:01.200 align:start position:0%
are 30 states that are standing around
 
05:50:02.868 --> 05:50:02.878 align:start position:0%
states you had what was almost
 
05:50:05.430 --> 05:50:05.440 align:start position:0%
considered a duty to retreat to the wall
 
05:50:06.948 --> 05:50:06.958 align:start position:0%
because the life of your attacker was
 
05:50:09.110 --> 05:50:09.120 align:start position:0%
considered so important this is almost
 
05:50:10.788 --> 05:50:10.798 align:start position:0%
the opposite of that there's no way that
 
05:50:12.390 --> 05:50:12.400 align:start position:0%
you can retreat to the wall to defend
 
05:50:14.310 --> 05:50:14.320 align:start position:0%
another person who's under
 
05:50:16.470 --> 05:50:16.480 align:start position:0%
attack the gang leader
 
05:50:18.070 --> 05:50:18.080 align:start position:0%
who was involved in that violent brawl
 
05:50:20.948 --> 05:50:20.958 align:start position:0%
in my home from my self-defense case um
 
05:50:22.788 --> 05:50:22.798 align:start position:0%
later on a few weeks after the police
 
05:50:24.548 --> 05:50:24.558 align:start position:0%
let him go he cut up a woman's face with
 
05:50:26.548 --> 05:50:26.558 align:start position:0%
some type of glass
 
05:50:26.558 --> 05:50:28.150 align:start position:0%
some type of glass
um

05:50:28.150 --> 05:50:28.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:50:30.470 --> 05:50:30.480 align:start position:0%
candle holder or some such thing
 
05:50:32.628 --> 05:50:32.638 align:start position:0%
and uh that could be considered felony
 
05:50:35.030 --> 05:50:35.040 align:start position:0%
assault it uh she could use deadly force
 
05:50:37.270 --> 05:50:37.280 align:start position:0%
to defend herself but if he had attacked
 
05:50:39.510 --> 05:50:39.520 align:start position:0%
her five-year-old daughter
 
05:50:41.110 --> 05:50:41.120 align:start position:0%
uh she would not be allowed to use
 
05:50:43.830 --> 05:50:43.840 align:start position:0%
deadly force uh last year last session
 
05:50:46.070 --> 05:50:46.080 align:start position:0%
every republican and 11 democrats on the
 
05:50:47.830 --> 05:50:47.840 align:start position:0%
floor voted for this every republican on
 
05:50:50.150 --> 05:50:50.160 align:start position:0%
this committee voted for this bill
 
05:50:52.230 --> 05:50:52.240 align:start position:0%
the term duty comes from declaration of
 
05:50:53.590 --> 05:50:53.600 align:start position:0%
independence it wouldn't be added to the
 
05:50:56.868 --> 05:50:56.878 align:start position:0%
statute it's just part of the findings
 
05:50:58.628 --> 05:50:58.638 align:start position:0%
um i'm one of the state's foremost
 
05:51:01.830 --> 05:51:01.840 align:start position:0%
experts in self-defense law um
 
05:51:05.190 --> 05:51:05.200 align:start position:0%
and i can tell you that salt the rsa 627
 
05:51:07.350 --> 05:51:07.360 align:start position:0%
the justifications are absolutely full
 
05:51:09.750 --> 05:51:09.760 align:start position:0%
of inconsistencies
 
05:51:13.670 --> 05:51:13.680 align:start position:0%
um and i'm willing to take questions
 
05:51:15.430 --> 05:51:15.440 align:start position:0%
perfect timing representative abramson
 
05:51:16.548 --> 05:51:16.558 align:start position:0%
all right
 
05:51:18.868 --> 05:51:18.878 align:start position:0%
i saw the fingers
 
05:51:23.270 --> 05:51:23.280 align:start position:0%
in two alarms went off i appreciate that
 
05:51:24.788 --> 05:51:24.798 align:start position:0%
representative calmly
 
05:51:26.628 --> 05:51:26.638 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
05:51:28.070 --> 05:51:28.080 align:start position:0%
taking the question representative
 
05:51:28.080 --> 05:51:29.590 align:start position:0%
taking the question representative
davidson

05:51:29.590 --> 05:51:29.600 align:start position:0%
davidson
 
05:51:31.430 --> 05:51:31.440 align:start position:0%
is i've been wondering who to ask this
 
05:51:31.440 --> 05:51:32.708 align:start position:0%
is i've been wondering who to ask this
too

05:51:32.708 --> 05:51:32.718 align:start position:0%
too
 
05:51:35.590 --> 05:51:35.600 align:start position:0%
but is it your sincere belief
 
05:51:37.830 --> 05:51:37.840 align:start position:0%
that if somebody had broken into my home
 
05:51:39.270 --> 05:51:39.280 align:start position:0%
in a home invasion
 
05:51:42.150 --> 05:51:42.160 align:start position:0%
and attacked my child
 
05:51:44.948 --> 05:51:44.958 align:start position:0%
a visitor in my home
 
05:51:46.310 --> 05:51:46.320 align:start position:0%
whenever it would be that i would be
 
05:51:48.708 --> 05:51:48.718 align:start position:0%
charged with a crime for using deadly
 
05:51:50.548 --> 05:51:50.558 align:start position:0%
force against that person is that your
 
05:51:52.788 --> 05:51:52.798 align:start position:0%
that's that you're saying here
 
05:51:56.310 --> 05:51:56.320 align:start position:0%
yes i was charged with eight felonies
 
05:51:59.030 --> 05:51:59.040 align:start position:0%
eight felonies with a maximum sentence
 
05:52:01.510 --> 05:52:01.520 align:start position:0%
at the time of 56 years in prison for
 
05:52:03.270 --> 05:52:03.280 align:start position:0%
acting in defense of the other people in
 
05:52:04.948 --> 05:52:04.958 align:start position:0%
my home that's exactly what happened in
 
05:52:07.590 --> 05:52:07.600 align:start position:0%
my self-defense case i admitted uh
 
05:52:09.590 --> 05:52:09.600 align:start position:0%
during closing and i probably shouldn't
 
05:52:11.030 --> 05:52:11.040 align:start position:0%
but in closing arguments during the
 
05:52:13.190 --> 05:52:13.200 align:start position:0%
trial that this was a defense of others
 
05:52:15.510 --> 05:52:15.520 align:start position:0%
case that i was obviously acting in
 
05:52:17.830 --> 05:52:17.840 align:start position:0%
defense of the other people in my home
 
05:52:20.628 --> 05:52:20.638 align:start position:0%
and uh despite all of the witnesses
 
05:52:22.548 --> 05:52:22.558 align:start position:0%
saying that to the police
 
05:52:25.110 --> 05:52:25.120 align:start position:0%
the prosecutor patricia conway
 
05:52:26.708 --> 05:52:26.718 align:start position:0%
went to a grand jury and got eight
 
05:52:28.548 --> 05:52:28.558 align:start position:0%
felony indictments
 
05:52:30.390 --> 05:52:30.400 align:start position:0%
and it was just by sheer luck that i
 
05:52:32.548 --> 05:52:32.558 align:start position:0%
didn't end up with life in prison for
 
05:52:39.750 --> 05:52:39.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:43.030 --> 05:52:43.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:50.070 --> 05:52:50.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:51.830 --> 05:52:51.840 align:start position:0%
no hand hands raised i want to thank the
 
05:52:56.230 --> 05:52:56.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:03.190 --> 05:53:03.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:04.868 --> 05:53:04.878 align:start position:0%
thank you for giving me the opportunity
 
05:53:07.510 --> 05:53:07.520 align:start position:0%
to speak um i'll
 
05:53:10.628 --> 05:53:10.638 align:start position:0%
i will say i'm opposed to this bill
 
05:53:13.110 --> 05:53:13.120 align:start position:0%
as a
 
05:53:15.350 --> 05:53:15.360 align:start position:0%
latina woman
 
05:53:18.310 --> 05:53:18.320 align:start position:0%
i don't feel comfortable because if i
 
05:53:20.868 --> 05:53:20.878 align:start position:0%
shoot someone in my property
 
05:53:23.030 --> 05:53:23.040 align:start position:0%
because of my skin color the lot will
 
05:53:26.070 --> 05:53:26.080 align:start position:0%
not protect me and a lot probably say
 
05:53:26.080 --> 05:53:27.350 align:start position:0%
not protect me and a lot probably say
that

05:53:27.350 --> 05:53:27.360 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:53:27.360 --> 05:53:28.230 align:start position:0%
that
um

05:53:28.230 --> 05:53:28.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:53:30.310 --> 05:53:30.320 align:start position:0%
i killed someone and not because i was
 
05:53:32.628 --> 05:53:32.638 align:start position:0%
trying to protect myself and then the
 
05:53:34.868 --> 05:53:34.878 align:start position:0%
other thing that i will say is
 
05:53:34.878 --> 05:53:35.830 align:start position:0%

05:55:07.510 --> 05:55:07.520 align:start position:0%
yes we can okay for the record j.r hall
 
05:55:09.750 --> 05:55:09.760 align:start position:0%
former state rep um currently live in
 
05:55:11.910 --> 05:55:11.920 align:start position:0%
the town of dunbarton here speaking on
 
05:55:13.430 --> 05:55:13.440 align:start position:0%
behalf of myself as well as the new
 
05:55:15.830 --> 05:55:15.840 align:start position:0%
hampshire firearms coalition
 
05:55:17.430 --> 05:55:17.440 align:start position:0%
the bill before you
 
05:55:19.670 --> 05:55:19.680 align:start position:0%
house bill 81 is a simple clerical
 
05:55:21.190 --> 05:55:21.200 align:start position:0%
change to the law
 
05:55:23.190 --> 05:55:23.200 align:start position:0%
we've heard from numerous people today
 
05:55:25.190 --> 05:55:25.200 align:start position:0%
who have expressed concerns about
 
05:55:27.670 --> 05:55:27.680 align:start position:0%
firearms and stand your ground laws and
 
05:55:29.910 --> 05:55:29.920 align:start position:0%
brought up all sorts of hyperbole
 
05:55:31.990 --> 05:55:32.000 align:start position:0%
but the reality is
 
05:55:34.070 --> 05:55:34.080 align:start position:0%
if someone is about to commit a felony
 
05:55:35.910 --> 05:55:35.920 align:start position:0%
against another person in your home
 
05:55:37.990 --> 05:55:38.000 align:start position:0%
whether that's a resident of your home
 
05:55:41.030 --> 05:55:41.040 align:start position:0%
meaning sorry a visitor to your home or
 
05:55:43.110 --> 05:55:43.120 align:start position:0%
a family member who just happens to be
 
05:55:45.350 --> 05:55:45.360 align:start position:0%
there but live somewhere else
 
05:55:47.110 --> 05:55:47.120 align:start position:0%
the ability to protect that person is
 
05:55:49.190 --> 05:55:49.200 align:start position:0%
important and
 
05:55:51.350 --> 05:55:51.360 align:start position:0%
this was clearly just a minor clerical
 
05:55:53.030 --> 05:55:53.040 align:start position:0%
correction anything above and beyond
 
05:55:55.670 --> 05:55:55.680 align:start position:0%
that is hyperbole from the other side
 
05:55:57.670 --> 05:55:57.680 align:start position:0%
i would like to comment on the person
 
05:55:59.030 --> 05:55:59.040 align:start position:0%
who asked that we should have debates
 
05:56:01.190 --> 05:56:01.200 align:start position:0%
and discussions i absolutely agree with
 
05:56:03.030 --> 05:56:03.040 align:start position:0%
their comment from earlier today and the
 
05:56:04.470 --> 05:56:04.480 align:start position:0%
sooner that we can return to the state
 
05:56:05.910 --> 05:56:05.920 align:start position:0%
house to start having these discussions
 
05:56:07.910 --> 05:56:07.920 align:start position:0%
in person the better off we will be
 
05:56:09.750 --> 05:56:09.760 align:start position:0%
so with that i'll close my testimony and
 
05:56:11.670 --> 05:56:11.680 align:start position:0%
ask that you pass this bill as filed
 
05:56:16.868 --> 05:56:16.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:18.390 --> 05:56:18.400 align:start position:0%
did i make my time limit representative
 
05:56:18.400 --> 05:56:20.150 align:start position:0%
did i make my time limit representative

05:56:24.160 --> 05:56:30.788 align:start position:0%
i want to thank the witness for the

terrific thank you so much mr chairman
 
05:56:45.910 --> 05:56:45.920 align:start position:0%
and honorable members of the committee
 
05:56:48.548 --> 05:56:48.558 align:start position:0%
um my name is doug marino um
 
05:56:51.350 --> 05:56:51.360 align:start position:0%
um and i'm uh testifying in opposition
 
05:56:54.150 --> 05:56:54.160 align:start position:0%
um to house bill 81 as well as the other
 
05:56:54.160 --> 05:56:55.350 align:start position:0%
um to house bill 81 as well as the other
um

05:56:55.350 --> 05:56:55.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:56:57.510 --> 05:56:57.520 align:start position:0%
stand your ground bills coming up uh
 
05:56:59.910 --> 05:56:59.920 align:start position:0%
later in this hearing um i think it's
 
05:57:01.670 --> 05:57:01.680 align:start position:0%
really important for us to remember that
 
05:57:03.510 --> 05:57:03.520 align:start position:0%
any bill like this is going to
 
05:57:04.948 --> 05:57:04.958 align:start position:0%
disproportionately impact people of
 
05:57:07.270 --> 05:57:07.280 align:start position:0%
color in new hampshire because of of
 
05:57:09.910 --> 05:57:09.920 align:start position:0%
racism implicit bias
 
05:57:11.910 --> 05:57:11.920 align:start position:0%
and so i urge committee members to
 
05:57:13.350 --> 05:57:13.360 align:start position:0%
consider that as you're considering this
 
05:57:15.990 --> 05:57:16.000 align:start position:0%
bill especially on today which is
 
05:57:18.788 --> 05:57:18.798 align:start position:0%
trayvon martin's 26th birthday um
 
05:57:20.470 --> 05:57:20.480 align:start position:0%
trayvon martin should be alive today but
 
05:57:22.310 --> 05:57:22.320 align:start position:0%
he's not because of a vigilante who
 
05:57:24.070 --> 05:57:24.080 align:start position:0%
decided to take his life
 
05:57:26.390 --> 05:57:26.400 align:start position:0%
um so i would strongly strongly urge you
 
05:57:29.190 --> 05:57:29.200 align:start position:0%
to take these things into consideration
 
05:57:30.708 --> 05:57:30.718 align:start position:0%
and recommend that the spell is
 
05:57:32.788 --> 05:57:32.798 align:start position:0%
inexpedient to legislate
 
05:57:43.190 --> 05:57:43.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:45.270 --> 05:57:45.280 align:start position:0%

um i throughout my career i've been
 
05:58:58.868 --> 05:58:58.878 align:start position:0%
involved in issues of violence and uh
 
05:59:02.868 --> 05:59:02.878 align:start position:0%
since 2013 i have been chair of the new
 
05:59:05.510 --> 05:59:05.520 align:start position:0%
hampshire medical society subcommittee
 
05:59:06.948 --> 05:59:06.958 align:start position:0%
on violence
 
05:59:09.590 --> 05:59:09.600 align:start position:0%
psychiatrists and physicians in general
 
05:59:11.830 --> 05:59:11.840 align:start position:0%
are intimately involved in issues of
 
05:59:13.830 --> 05:59:13.840 align:start position:0%
inviola of violence
 
05:59:16.948 --> 05:59:16.958 align:start position:0%
and as psychiatrists we treat patients
 
05:59:19.190 --> 05:59:19.200 align:start position:0%
who are potentially are act actually
 
05:59:19.200 --> 05:59:20.548 align:start position:0%
who are potentially are act actually
violent

05:59:20.548 --> 05:59:20.558 align:start position:0%
violent
 
05:59:22.548 --> 05:59:22.558 align:start position:0%
and as general physicians of course we
 
05:59:25.110 --> 05:59:25.120 align:start position:0%
treat them in our emergency rooms our
 
05:59:28.948 --> 05:59:28.958 align:start position:0%
hospitals and our offices
 
05:59:31.030 --> 05:59:31.040 align:start position:0%
many of us study the precursors of
 
05:59:31.040 --> 05:59:34.150 align:start position:0%
many of us study the precursors of
violence

05:59:34.150 --> 05:59:34.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:36.868 --> 05:59:36.878 align:start position:0%
so i've been quite concerned with the
 
05:59:38.868 --> 05:59:38.878 align:start position:0%
advent of stand your ground laws like
 
05:59:41.310 --> 05:59:41.320 align:start position:0%
the one currently in effect since
 
05:59:44.230 --> 05:59:44.240 align:start position:0%
2011 in new hampshire
 
05:59:44.240 --> 05:59:45.110 align:start position:0%
2011 in new hampshire
uh

05:59:45.110 --> 05:59:45.120 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:59:47.190 --> 05:59:47.200 align:start position:0%
stand underground laws are relatively
 
05:59:47.200 --> 05:59:48.548 align:start position:0%
stand underground laws are relatively
new

05:59:48.548 --> 05:59:48.558 align:start position:0%
new
 
05:59:51.350 --> 05:59:51.360 align:start position:0%
controversial laws and they uh
 
05:59:53.750 --> 05:59:53.760 align:start position:0%
introduced defenses that were never
 
05:59:58.150 --> 05:59:58.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:59.910 --> 05:59:59.920 align:start position:0%
stand your ground laws change the
 
06:00:02.310 --> 06:00:02.320 align:start position:0%
dynamic fundamentally so that killing
 
06:00:04.868 --> 06:00:04.878 align:start position:0%
another person becomes justifiable or
 
06:00:07.670 --> 06:00:07.680 align:start position:0%
defensible in circumstances of a
 
06:00:09.430 --> 06:00:09.440 align:start position:0%
subjective nature
 
06:00:11.270 --> 06:00:11.280 align:start position:0%
where being threatened or feeling
 
06:00:14.310 --> 06:00:14.320 align:start position:0%
threatened is enough reason to kill
 
06:00:14.320 --> 06:00:15.350 align:start position:0%
threatened is enough reason to kill
where

06:00:15.350 --> 06:00:15.360 align:start position:0%
where
 
06:00:17.990 --> 06:00:18.000 align:start position:0%
other non-violent methods such as escape
 
06:00:23.990 --> 06:00:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:25.190 --> 06:00:25.200 align:start position:0%
mr corny
 
06:00:26.708 --> 06:00:26.718 align:start position:0%

06:00:45.590 --> 06:00:45.600 align:start position:0%
have shown that stand your ground laws
 
06:00:45.600 --> 06:00:47.830 align:start position:0%
have shown that stand your ground laws
increase

06:00:47.830 --> 06:00:47.840 align:start position:0%
increase
 
06:00:49.910 --> 06:00:49.920 align:start position:0%

06:02:02.470 --> 06:02:02.480 align:start position:0%
remotely doing an excellent job and
 
06:02:02.480 --> 06:02:04.628 align:start position:0%
remotely doing an excellent job and
assisting

06:02:04.628 --> 06:02:04.638 align:start position:0%
assisting
 
06:02:04.638 --> 06:02:06.548 align:start position:0%
assisting
uh

06:02:06.548 --> 06:02:06.558 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:02:47.270 --> 06:02:47.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:59.670 --> 06:02:59.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:15.190 --> 06:03:15.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:17.590 --> 06:03:17.600 align:start position:0%
yeah we can hear you now
 
06:03:19.590 --> 06:03:19.600 align:start position:0%
what did we miss
 
06:03:19.600 --> 06:03:21.190 align:start position:0%
what did we miss
we'll

06:03:21.190 --> 06:03:21.200 align:start position:0%
we'll
 
06:03:25.270 --> 06:03:25.280 align:start position:0%
start over just look for the there was a
 
06:03:27.510 --> 06:03:27.520 align:start position:0%
representative burt was recognized for a
 
06:03:27.520 --> 06:03:29.110 align:start position:0%
representative burt was recognized for a
motion

06:03:29.110 --> 06:03:29.120 align:start position:0%
motion
 
06:03:31.510 --> 06:03:31.520 align:start position:0%
about the past that motion was then
 
06:03:34.390 --> 06:03:34.400 align:start position:0%
seconded by representative roy
 
06:03:36.788 --> 06:03:36.798 align:start position:0%
i then asked representative burke if you
 
06:03:38.470 --> 06:03:38.480 align:start position:0%
would like to speak
 
06:03:41.350 --> 06:03:41.360 align:start position:0%
uh to his motion
 
06:03:43.830 --> 06:03:43.840 align:start position:0%
thank you again mr chairman and
 
06:03:47.350 --> 06:03:47.360 align:start position:0%
the reason i support this bill is
 
06:03:51.510 --> 06:03:51.520 align:start position:0%
like mr rice said and several others
 
06:03:54.470 --> 06:03:54.480 align:start position:0%
i have a right to protect myself and my
 
06:03:56.788 --> 06:03:56.798 align:start position:0%
wife in my home
 
06:03:58.390 --> 06:03:58.400 align:start position:0%
but if my brother comes over from
 
06:04:00.470 --> 06:04:00.480 align:start position:0%
vermont and visits me
 
06:04:02.310 --> 06:04:02.320 align:start position:0%
apparently in new hampshire i don't have
 
06:04:04.390 --> 06:04:04.400 align:start position:0%
that right and
 
06:04:07.670 --> 06:04:07.680 align:start position:0%
i feel i should and again
 
06:04:10.470 --> 06:04:10.480 align:start position:0%
it would be the last resort that i would
 
06:04:12.788 --> 06:04:12.798 align:start position:0%
ever ever you know
 
06:04:14.548 --> 06:04:14.558 align:start position:0%
reach to
 
06:04:14.558 --> 06:04:15.350 align:start position:0%
reach to
um

06:04:15.350 --> 06:04:15.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:04:16.788 --> 06:04:16.798 align:start position:0%
you know and again if somebody wanted to
 
06:04:18.470 --> 06:04:18.480 align:start position:0%
steal my tv i you know i don't want to
 
06:04:20.548 --> 06:04:20.558 align:start position:0%
put that out on the internet but
 
06:04:20.558 --> 06:04:21.430 align:start position:0%
put that out on the internet but
um

06:04:21.430 --> 06:04:21.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:04:22.868 --> 06:04:22.878 align:start position:0%
you know
 
06:04:24.150 --> 06:04:24.160 align:start position:0%
you know
 
06:04:26.070 --> 06:04:26.080 align:start position:0%
you know sadly i'm gonna go and buy a
 
06:04:27.910 --> 06:04:27.920 align:start position:0%
new tv but you know if they come into
 
06:04:29.670 --> 06:04:29.680 align:start position:0%
the house and they want to hurt one of
 
06:04:29.680 --> 06:04:30.548 align:start position:0%
the house and they want to hurt one of
us

06:04:30.548 --> 06:04:30.558 align:start position:0%
us
 
06:04:32.628 --> 06:04:32.638 align:start position:0%
you know i want that option
 
06:04:35.350 --> 06:04:35.360 align:start position:0%
not to be charged with defending their
 
06:04:35.360 --> 06:04:37.030 align:start position:0%
not to be charged with defending their
lives

06:04:37.030 --> 06:04:37.040 align:start position:0%
lives
 
06:04:39.430 --> 06:04:39.440 align:start position:0%
so this is a good bill i think you know
 
06:04:41.990 --> 06:04:42.000 align:start position:0%
new hampshire needs it and
 
06:04:44.548 --> 06:04:44.558 align:start position:0%
you know we have not seen mass carnage
 
06:04:47.910 --> 06:04:47.920 align:start position:0%
since i voted for the first time in 2011
 
06:04:49.190 --> 06:04:49.200 align:start position:0%
to pass
 
06:04:51.110 --> 06:04:51.120 align:start position:0%
you know the original stand your ground
 
06:04:54.150 --> 06:04:54.160 align:start position:0%
and this just changes a few words to add
 
06:04:56.470 --> 06:04:56.480 align:start position:0%
anybody in the house thank you mr
 
06:04:56.480 --> 06:05:00.490 align:start position:0%
anybody in the house thank you mr
chairman

06:05:00.490 --> 06:05:00.500 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:00.500 --> 06:05:01.830 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

06:05:01.830 --> 06:05:01.840 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
06:05:05.670 --> 06:05:05.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:08.070 --> 06:05:08.080 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman i i
 
06:05:10.470 --> 06:05:10.480 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure the committee has read
 
06:05:13.110 --> 06:05:13.120 align:start position:0%
all the section uh two
 
06:05:15.430 --> 06:05:15.440 align:start position:0%
but i'll start with uh
 
06:05:18.070 --> 06:05:18.080 align:start position:0%
a person is justifying the deadly force
 
06:05:19.990 --> 06:05:20.000 align:start position:0%
upon another person when he is
 
06:05:22.548 --> 06:05:22.558 align:start position:0%
reasonably believed that such other
 
06:05:24.230 --> 06:05:24.240 align:start position:0%
person a
 
06:05:27.270 --> 06:05:27.280 align:start position:0%
is about to use unlawful deadly force
 
06:05:30.390 --> 06:05:30.400 align:start position:0%
against the actor or a third person
 
06:05:32.390 --> 06:05:32.400 align:start position:0%
which is what i've really been hearing
 
06:05:32.400 --> 06:05:33.590 align:start position:0%
which is what i've really been hearing
the

06:05:33.590 --> 06:05:33.600 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:05:35.670 --> 06:05:35.680 align:start position:0%
purpose of this bill was
 
06:05:39.510 --> 06:05:39.520 align:start position:0%
uh b is likely to use any unlawful force
 
06:05:41.350 --> 06:05:41.360 align:start position:0%
against a person present while
 
06:05:43.670 --> 06:05:43.680 align:start position:0%
committing or attempting to commit a
 
06:05:43.680 --> 06:05:45.110 align:start position:0%
committing or attempting to commit a
burglary

06:05:45.110 --> 06:05:45.120 align:start position:0%
burglary
 
06:05:45.120 --> 06:05:45.910 align:start position:0%
burglary
c

06:05:45.910 --> 06:05:45.920 align:start position:0%
c
 
06:05:47.830 --> 06:05:47.840 align:start position:0%
is committing or about to commit
 
06:05:47.840 --> 06:05:49.110 align:start position:0%
is committing or about to commit
kidnapping

06:05:49.110 --> 06:05:49.120 align:start position:0%
kidnapping
 
06:05:51.670 --> 06:05:51.680 align:start position:0%
or forcible sex offense
 
06:05:51.680 --> 06:05:53.430 align:start position:0%
or forcible sex offense
indeed

06:05:53.430 --> 06:05:53.440 align:start position:0%
indeed
 
06:05:56.390 --> 06:05:56.400 align:start position:0%
is likely to use any unlawful force in
 
06:05:58.310 --> 06:05:58.320 align:start position:0%
the commission of a felony
 
06:05:58.320 --> 06:05:59.910 align:start position:0%
the commission of a felony
now

06:05:59.910 --> 06:05:59.920 align:start position:0%
now
 
06:06:04.750 --> 06:06:04.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:06.708 --> 06:06:06.718 align:start position:0%
unlawful force
 
06:06:09.270 --> 06:06:09.280 align:start position:0%
could be only by shoving someone against
 
06:06:10.150 --> 06:06:10.160 align:start position:0%
the wall
 
06:06:13.830 --> 06:06:13.840 align:start position:0%
now if i were someone and if you're
 
06:06:15.590 --> 06:06:15.600 align:start position:0%
making a commitment you're doing a
 
06:06:18.708 --> 06:06:18.718 align:start position:0%
felony of sending selling an illegal
 
06:06:21.190 --> 06:06:21.200 align:start position:0%
drug to that person
 
06:06:23.990 --> 06:06:24.000 align:start position:0%
then you would then have the right based
 
06:06:26.708 --> 06:06:26.718 align:start position:0%
on this law to uh
 
06:06:30.070 --> 06:06:30.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:32.628 --> 06:06:32.638 align:start position:0%
so i would say that this bill is
 
06:06:34.788 --> 06:06:34.798 align:start position:0%
completely unnecessary based on a
 
06:06:37.190 --> 06:06:37.200 align:start position:0%
testimony we've heard because third
 
06:06:38.470 --> 06:06:38.480 align:start position:0%
person is
 
06:06:38.480 --> 06:06:39.430 align:start position:0%
person is
uh

06:06:39.430 --> 06:06:39.440 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:06:42.708 --> 06:06:42.718 align:start position:0%
taken care of in paragraph a
 
06:06:45.190 --> 06:06:45.200 align:start position:0%
so i'm gonna oppose the motion to
 
06:06:45.200 --> 06:06:47.190 align:start position:0%
so i'm gonna oppose the motion to
autopass

06:06:47.190 --> 06:06:47.200 align:start position:0%
autopass
 
06:06:58.150 --> 06:06:58.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:00.150 --> 06:07:00.160 align:start position:0%
and just a
 
06:07:02.150 --> 06:07:02.160 align:start position:0%
for point of discussion
 
06:07:03.990 --> 06:07:04.000 align:start position:0%
i think paragraph a and representative
 
06:07:05.670 --> 06:07:05.680 align:start position:0%
board that
 
06:07:07.670 --> 06:07:07.680 align:start position:0%
it says is about to use unlawful deadly
 
06:07:10.470 --> 06:07:10.480 align:start position:0%
force against the actor or third person
 
06:07:13.910 --> 06:07:13.920 align:start position:0%
when my interpretation of paragraph d
 
06:07:16.548 --> 06:07:16.558 align:start position:0%
is it's is likely to use unlawful force
 
06:07:18.470 --> 06:07:18.480 align:start position:0%
and the commission of a felony which
 
06:07:20.470 --> 06:07:20.480 align:start position:0%
doesn't necessarily have to amount to
 
06:07:22.150 --> 06:07:22.160 align:start position:0%
the involving
 
06:07:24.150 --> 06:07:24.160 align:start position:0%
deadly force
 
06:07:26.628 --> 06:07:26.638 align:start position:0%
against the actor and then but you could
 
06:07:29.110 --> 06:07:29.120 align:start position:0%
not use you could only against
 
06:07:31.430 --> 06:07:31.440 align:start position:0%
the act not against
 
06:07:33.430 --> 06:07:33.440 align:start position:0%
another a third person so i think that a
 
06:07:36.070 --> 06:07:36.080 align:start position:0%
indeed where they did separate
 
06:07:40.070 --> 06:07:40.080 align:start position:0%
is that a is strictly involving
 
06:07:43.030 --> 06:07:43.040 align:start position:0%
unlawful deadly force where i think uh d
 
06:07:43.040 --> 06:07:44.230 align:start position:0%
unlawful deadly force where i think uh d
could

06:07:44.230 --> 06:07:44.240 align:start position:0%
could
 
06:07:45.910 --> 06:07:45.920 align:start position:0%
would not necessarily have to rise that
 
06:07:45.920 --> 06:07:48.788 align:start position:0%
would not necessarily have to rise that
well

06:07:48.788 --> 06:07:48.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:58.830 --> 06:07:58.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:08:01.350 --> 06:08:01.360 align:start position:0%
oh not bad again
 
06:08:04.868 --> 06:08:04.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:08:04.878 --> 06:08:06.310 align:start position:0%
 
thinking

06:08:06.310 --> 06:08:06.320 align:start position:0%
thinking
 
06:08:06.320 --> 06:08:07.350 align:start position:0%
thinking
um

06:08:07.350 --> 06:08:07.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:08:09.110 --> 06:08:09.120 align:start position:0%
the problem
 
06:08:11.590 --> 06:08:11.600 align:start position:0%
i have with this bill is this same
 
06:08:13.350 --> 06:08:13.360 align:start position:0%
problem i had with at last
 
06:08:14.868 --> 06:08:14.878 align:start position:0%
and that is
 
06:08:17.350 --> 06:08:17.360 align:start position:0%
it talks about
 
06:08:20.310 --> 06:08:20.320 align:start position:0%
any felony and we know that felonies
 
06:08:24.470 --> 06:08:24.480 align:start position:0%
have a whole range of uh
 
06:08:26.830 --> 06:08:26.840 align:start position:0%
our whole range of offenses from
 
06:08:29.430 --> 06:08:29.440 align:start position:0%
drugging selling drugs
 
06:08:30.868 --> 06:08:30.878 align:start position:0%
to uh
 
06:08:32.548 --> 06:08:32.558 align:start position:0%
murder and robbery
 
06:08:34.948 --> 06:08:34.958 align:start position:0%
now even robbery
 
06:08:34.958 --> 06:08:35.990 align:start position:0%
now even robbery
uh

06:08:35.990 --> 06:08:36.000 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:08:36.000 --> 06:08:36.948 align:start position:0%
uh
is

06:08:36.948 --> 06:08:36.958 align:start position:0%
is
 
06:08:38.628 --> 06:08:38.638 align:start position:0%
with a deadly weapon
 
06:08:39.910 --> 06:08:39.920 align:start position:0%
is a
 
06:08:39.920 --> 06:08:42.470 align:start position:0%
is a
felony

06:08:42.470 --> 06:08:42.480 align:start position:0%
felony
 
06:08:42.480 --> 06:08:43.910 align:start position:0%
felony
but

06:08:43.910 --> 06:08:43.920 align:start position:0%
but
 
06:08:46.548 --> 06:08:46.558 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure selling drugs isn't
 
06:08:49.110 --> 06:08:49.120 align:start position:0%
necessarily something that requires the
 
06:08:51.670 --> 06:08:51.680 align:start position:0%
use of deadly force on
 
06:08:55.670 --> 06:08:55.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:08:55.680 --> 06:08:56.390 align:start position:0%
 
and

06:08:56.390 --> 06:08:56.400 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:09:00.390 --> 06:09:00.400 align:start position:0%
just declare so i read paragraph that if
 
06:09:01.430 --> 06:09:01.440 align:start position:0%
if the
 
06:09:03.030 --> 06:09:03.040 align:start position:0%
person was selling drugs they would also
 
06:09:05.590 --> 06:09:05.600 align:start position:0%
have to if that is the felony they would
 
06:09:07.750 --> 06:09:07.760 align:start position:0%
also have been using unlawful force
 
06:09:10.708 --> 06:09:10.718 align:start position:0%
against the actor at the same time
 
06:09:12.150 --> 06:09:12.160 align:start position:0%
that's just the way i'm reading and i
 
06:09:14.150 --> 06:09:14.160 align:start position:0%
just want to clarify that i mean if i'm
 
06:09:17.590 --> 06:09:17.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:19.990 --> 06:09:20.000 align:start position:0%
representative gordon
 
06:09:21.990 --> 06:09:22.000 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:09:25.270 --> 06:09:25.280 align:start position:0%
it doesn't say indeed that it's on your
 
06:09:28.548 --> 06:09:28.558 align:start position:0%
they are using deadly force they say
 
06:09:28.558 --> 06:09:31.110 align:start position:0%
they are using deadly force they say
on

06:09:31.110 --> 06:09:31.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:34.150 --> 06:09:34.160 align:start position:0%
unlawful force and it was we know
 
06:09:34.160 --> 06:09:34.948 align:start position:0%
unlawful force and it was we know
that

06:09:34.948 --> 06:09:34.958 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:09:38.470 --> 06:09:38.480 align:start position:0%
unlawful force could be as simple as uh
 
06:09:40.628 --> 06:09:40.638 align:start position:0%
punching someone in the arm or shoving
 
06:09:42.230 --> 06:09:42.240 align:start position:0%
someone against the wall
 
06:09:45.190 --> 06:09:45.200 align:start position:0%
anytime that you are basically uh
 
06:09:47.910 --> 06:09:47.920 align:start position:0%
touching someone in a forceful way that
 
06:09:47.920 --> 06:09:49.350 align:start position:0%
touching someone in a forceful way that
uh

06:09:49.350 --> 06:09:49.360 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:09:52.948 --> 06:09:52.958 align:start position:0%
you want them to do something for you
 
06:09:52.958 --> 06:09:54.948 align:start position:0%
you want them to do something for you
so

06:09:54.948 --> 06:09:54.958 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:09:58.070 --> 06:09:58.080 align:start position:0%
it would allow you basically
 
06:10:01.670 --> 06:10:01.680 align:start position:0%
to use a deadly force for
 
06:10:01.680 --> 06:10:03.110 align:start position:0%
to use a deadly force for
small

06:10:03.110 --> 06:10:03.120 align:start position:0%
small
 
06:10:05.190 --> 06:10:05.200 align:start position:0%
infractions of
 
06:10:05.200 --> 06:10:11.270 align:start position:0%
infractions of
unlawful

06:10:11.270 --> 06:10:11.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:10:14.948 --> 06:10:14.958 align:start position:0%
representative holding do you wish to
 
06:10:16.230 --> 06:10:16.240 align:start position:0%
speak on the
 
06:10:18.868 --> 06:10:18.878 align:start position:0%
on the motion
 
06:10:21.190 --> 06:10:21.200 align:start position:0%
i was listening to the testimony today i
 
06:10:23.190 --> 06:10:23.200 align:start position:0%
heard a lot of testimony saying that
 
06:10:25.510 --> 06:10:25.520 align:start position:0%
this is a clear king
 
06:10:28.070 --> 06:10:28.080 align:start position:0%
and it appears that the um
 
06:10:30.070 --> 06:10:30.080 align:start position:0%
i did the impression i hear the phrase
 
06:10:31.990 --> 06:10:32.000 align:start position:0%
terrible change that means
 
06:10:33.430 --> 06:10:33.440 align:start position:0%
that the sponsor who fought the
 
06:10:35.670 --> 06:10:35.680 align:start position:0%
legislation that resulted in this law
 
06:10:37.350 --> 06:10:37.360 align:start position:0%
had originally intended for the law to
 
06:10:39.190 --> 06:10:39.200 align:start position:0%
have a broader scope than it was written
 
06:10:40.230 --> 06:10:40.240 align:start position:0%
to have
 
06:10:42.548 --> 06:10:42.558 align:start position:0%
that's what i hear when i hear clinical
 
06:10:42.558 --> 06:10:43.670 align:start position:0%
that's what i hear when i hear clinical
change

06:10:43.670 --> 06:10:43.680 align:start position:0%
change
 
06:10:43.680 --> 06:10:48.470 align:start position:0%
change
um

06:10:48.470 --> 06:10:48.480 align:start position:0%
 
06:10:50.948 --> 06:10:50.958 align:start position:0%
so i have some some concerns about
 
06:10:53.190 --> 06:10:53.200 align:start position:0%
um the level of understanding
 
06:10:53.200 --> 06:10:54.070 align:start position:0%
um the level of understanding
uh

06:10:54.070 --> 06:10:54.080 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:10:56.390 --> 06:10:56.400 align:start position:0%
by many of the people getting customers
 
06:10:57.750 --> 06:10:57.760 align:start position:0%
saying the impact
 
06:11:13.750 --> 06:11:13.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:17.510 --> 06:11:17.520 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman um so hb 81 proposes
 
06:11:19.990 --> 06:11:20.000 align:start position:0%
um an addition to allowing deadly force
 
06:11:22.708 --> 06:11:22.718 align:start position:0%
to be used when someone is using any
 
06:11:24.548 --> 06:11:24.558 align:start position:0%
unlawful force in the commission of a
 
06:11:26.868 --> 06:11:26.878 align:start position:0%
felony against another person within the
 
06:11:30.070 --> 06:11:30.080 align:start position:0%
actor's dwelling or cartilage
 
06:11:32.390 --> 06:11:32.400 align:start position:0%
hb 81 section d
 
06:11:34.310 --> 06:11:34.320 align:start position:0%
is likely to use any unlawful force in
 
06:11:35.910 --> 06:11:35.920 align:start position:0%
the commission of a felony against the
 
06:11:35.920 --> 06:11:37.030 align:start position:0%
the commission of a felony against the
actor

06:11:37.030 --> 06:11:37.040 align:start position:0%
actor
 
06:11:38.948 --> 06:11:38.958 align:start position:0%
or another within such actors dwelling
 
06:11:41.030 --> 06:11:41.040 align:start position:0%
or its cartilage and at first glance
 
06:11:42.948 --> 06:11:42.958 align:start position:0%
this seems like a plausible addition
 
06:11:45.030 --> 06:11:45.040 align:start position:0%
however when you look closer you'll
 
06:11:47.670 --> 06:11:47.680 align:start position:0%
realize that the current rsa is already
 
06:11:49.750 --> 06:11:49.760 align:start position:0%
authorizing deadly force in response to
 
06:11:51.910 --> 06:11:51.920 align:start position:0%
non-deadly force and that this bill
 
06:11:53.910 --> 06:11:53.920 align:start position:0%
seeks to expand the use of deadly force
 
06:11:55.910 --> 06:11:55.920 align:start position:0%
even further um
 
06:12:17.670 --> 06:12:17.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:12:26.310 --> 06:12:26.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:12:29.030 --> 06:12:29.040 align:start position:0%
um i kind of spoke to this earlier today
 
06:12:30.948 --> 06:12:30.958 align:start position:0%
probably should have saved it for now
 
06:12:33.030 --> 06:12:33.040 align:start position:0%
but again um
 
06:12:36.708 --> 06:12:36.718 align:start position:0%
in section 627.4
 
06:12:36.718 --> 06:12:38.230 align:start position:0%
in section 627.4
um

06:12:38.230 --> 06:12:38.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:12:41.350 --> 06:12:41.360 align:start position:0%
it starts at roman numeral three
 
06:12:43.510 --> 06:12:43.520 align:start position:0%
and if you read down through at least
 
06:12:44.788 --> 06:12:44.798 align:start position:0%
through a
 
06:12:47.270 --> 06:12:47.280 align:start position:0%
um i think it already covers that
 
06:12:47.280 --> 06:12:49.110 align:start position:0%
um i think it already covers that
situation

06:12:49.110 --> 06:12:49.120 align:start position:0%
situation
 
06:12:51.510 --> 06:12:51.520 align:start position:0%
so again i don't know why we have this
 
06:12:54.868 --> 06:12:54.878 align:start position:0%
build when it is it does cover the third
 
06:13:02.948 --> 06:13:02.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:05.190 --> 06:13:05.200 align:start position:0%
the first uh a tells you
 
06:13:06.628 --> 06:13:06.638 align:start position:0%
the first one
 
06:13:08.708 --> 06:13:08.718 align:start position:0%
tells you um what's not justified but
 
06:13:15.110 --> 06:13:15.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:16.628 --> 06:13:16.638 align:start position:0%
my understanding is
 
06:13:18.708 --> 06:13:18.718 align:start position:0%
we're going to actually get that portion
 
06:13:34.310 --> 06:13:34.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:37.110 --> 06:13:37.120 align:start position:0%
and that's exactly what this is from
 
06:13:38.868 --> 06:13:38.878 align:start position:0%
so maybe this part of another bill i
 
06:13:40.788 --> 06:13:40.798 align:start position:0%
don't know i'm just trying to say that
 
06:13:42.070 --> 06:13:42.080 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
06:13:43.510 --> 06:13:43.520 align:start position:0%
should be ikl
 
06:13:46.150 --> 06:13:46.160 align:start position:0%
because it is already covered what
 
06:13:54.948 --> 06:13:54.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:57.990 --> 06:13:58.000 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that there's a bill
 
06:14:00.628 --> 06:14:00.638 align:start position:0%
that it would actually file that would
 
06:14:02.628 --> 06:14:02.638 align:start position:0%
repeal that section it's not i'd
 
06:14:02.638 --> 06:14:13.990 align:start position:0%
repeal that section it's not i'd
probably

06:14:13.990 --> 06:14:14.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:14:14.000 --> 06:14:29.510 align:start position:0%
 
issue

06:14:29.510 --> 06:14:29.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:14:31.670 --> 06:14:31.680 align:start position:0%
mr chairman
 
06:14:31.680 --> 06:14:32.548 align:start position:0%
mr chairman
yes

06:14:32.548 --> 06:14:32.558 align:start position:0%
yes
 
06:14:34.868 --> 06:14:34.878 align:start position:0%
can you hear me mr chairman
 
06:14:37.030 --> 06:14:37.040 align:start position:0%
yeah okay i believe that the current law
 
06:14:38.788 --> 06:14:38.798 align:start position:0%
that we
 
06:14:40.628 --> 06:14:40.638 align:start position:0%
i believe that the current law
 
06:14:42.230 --> 06:14:42.240 align:start position:0%
covers this efficiently so i'll be
 
06:14:43.750 --> 06:14:43.760 align:start position:0%
opposing this bill
 
06:14:45.990 --> 06:14:46.000 align:start position:0%
and i'm not i i don't know how to make
 
06:14:47.830 --> 06:14:47.840 align:start position:0%
the relationship with another bill might
 
06:14:49.430 --> 06:14:49.440 align:start position:0%
be coming up
 
06:14:51.270 --> 06:14:51.280 align:start position:0%
but i think that what this bill is
 
06:14:52.628 --> 06:14:52.638 align:start position:0%
trying to do is already covered by
 
06:15:05.670 --> 06:15:05.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:06.788 --> 06:15:06.798 align:start position:0%

the
 
06:17:55.110 --> 06:17:55.120 align:start position:0%
last hearing was closed and at that
 
06:17:57.030 --> 06:17:57.040 align:start position:0%
point um
 
06:17:59.510 --> 06:17:59.520 align:start position:0%
xander rice hopkins and penny dean did

06:18:04.070 --> 06:18:04.080 align:start position:0%
and their hands are still raised so i
 
06:18:05.350 --> 06:18:05.360 align:start position:0%
don't know if they want to speak on this
 
06:18:07.270 --> 06:18:07.280 align:start position:0%
come and know or not
 
06:18:09.030 --> 06:18:09.040 align:start position:0%
we'll we'll address that once we once
 
06:18:11.190 --> 06:18:11.200 align:start position:0%
you remove the testimony the difficult
 
06:18:13.990 --> 06:18:14.000 align:start position:0%
problem is when once we close a hearing
 
06:18:14.000 --> 06:18:15.590 align:start position:0%
problem is when once we close a hearing
uh

06:18:15.590 --> 06:18:15.600 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:18:17.830 --> 06:18:17.840 align:start position:0%
it's not as simple as reopening it i'm
 
06:18:20.070 --> 06:18:20.080 align:start position:0%
not that's a
 
06:18:21.270 --> 06:18:21.280 align:start position:0%
rule that's already in place that i
 
06:18:22.390 --> 06:18:22.400 align:start position:0%
can't change
 
06:18:23.670 --> 06:18:23.680 align:start position:0%
i just to the members of the committee
 
06:18:25.510 --> 06:18:25.520 align:start position:0%
before we start i will say with
 
06:18:27.750 --> 06:18:27.760 align:start position:0%
confidence that a public hearing may go
 
06:18:29.910 --> 06:18:29.920 align:start position:0%
late i i will not be i don't believe
 
06:18:31.830 --> 06:18:31.840 align:start position:0%
we're gonna be doing any executive
 
06:18:33.990 --> 06:18:34.000 align:start position:0%
sessions on any other bills
 
06:18:35.350 --> 06:18:35.360 align:start position:0%
so just
 
06:18:37.910 --> 06:18:37.920 align:start position:0%
keep just to get let everyone know that
 
06:18:39.510 --> 06:18:39.520 align:start position:0%
because people as people are gonna have
 
06:18:41.910 --> 06:18:41.920 align:start position:0%
to leave and it's snowing
 
06:18:43.590 --> 06:18:43.600 align:start position:0%

and
 
06:18:46.150 --> 06:18:46.160 align:start position:0%
i know some some members have difficulty
 
06:18:47.590 --> 06:18:47.600 align:start position:0%
driving at night but we can still
 
06:18:49.590 --> 06:18:49.600 align:start position:0%
continue to public hearings
 
06:18:51.030 --> 06:18:51.040 align:start position:0%
i'll just leave it to the discretion of
 
06:18:52.708 --> 06:18:52.718 align:start position:0%
the members who um
 
06:18:54.070 --> 06:18:54.080 align:start position:0%

to participate
 
06:18:57.270 --> 06:18:57.280 align:start position:0%

work with you on this bill bill 198
 
06:21:04.708 --> 06:21:04.718 align:start position:0%
house bill 198.
 
06:21:06.868 --> 06:21:06.878 align:start position:0%
i'm happy to work here to ensure that
 
06:21:09.030 --> 06:21:09.040 align:start position:0%
the citizens of new hampshire
 
06:21:09.990 --> 06:21:10.000 align:start position:0%
are getting
 
06:21:12.948 --> 06:21:12.958 align:start position:0%
served and defended by our justice
 
06:21:15.830 --> 06:21:15.840 align:start position:0%
system that's what the bill is doing
 
06:21:17.350 --> 06:21:17.360 align:start position:0%
there was a need to clarify a few points
 
06:21:19.270 --> 06:21:19.280 align:start position:0%
in the rsas
 
06:21:21.350 --> 06:21:21.360 align:start position:0%
this is my bill
 
06:21:23.110 --> 06:21:23.120 align:start position:0%
as we've heard today self-preservation
 
06:21:24.310 --> 06:21:24.320 align:start position:0%
is one of the
 
06:21:26.628 --> 06:21:26.638 align:start position:0%
most fundamental rights of any human
 
06:21:26.638 --> 06:21:27.910 align:start position:0%
most fundamental rights of any human
being

06:21:27.910 --> 06:21:27.920 align:start position:0%
being
 
06:21:30.150 --> 06:21:30.160 align:start position:0%
of any living creature actually
 
06:21:33.110 --> 06:21:33.120 align:start position:0%
so this is what i felt was needed
 
06:21:39.590 --> 06:21:39.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:21:39.600 --> 06:21:40.948 align:start position:0%
 
um

06:21:40.948 --> 06:21:40.958 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:21:42.948 --> 06:21:42.958 align:start position:0%
this is what the bill is doing
 
06:21:44.948 --> 06:21:44.958 align:start position:0%
it's enshrining the need for
 
06:21:46.948 --> 06:21:46.958 align:start position:0%
self-preservation and
 
06:21:48.948 --> 06:21:48.958 align:start position:0%
if a person is feeling threatened in
 
06:21:51.110 --> 06:21:51.120 align:start position:0%
face of violent attackers
 
06:21:53.350 --> 06:21:53.360 align:start position:0%
he may resolve to
 
06:21:53.360 --> 06:21:55.750 align:start position:0%
he may resolve to
self-defense

06:21:55.750 --> 06:21:55.760 align:start position:0%
self-defense
 
06:21:57.430 --> 06:21:57.440 align:start position:0%
so it's up to the state
 
06:21:59.430 --> 06:21:59.440 align:start position:0%
it's up to the justice system to be
 
06:22:02.470 --> 06:22:02.480 align:start position:0%
aligned with citizens in preserving
 
06:22:04.310 --> 06:22:04.320 align:start position:0%
uh and defending the right of
 
06:22:04.320 --> 06:22:06.230 align:start position:0%
uh and defending the right of
self-defense

06:22:06.230 --> 06:22:06.240 align:start position:0%
self-defense
 
06:22:07.510 --> 06:22:07.520 align:start position:0%
and this is what this bill is doing
 
06:22:09.430 --> 06:22:09.440 align:start position:0%
because you you need to defend yourself
 
06:22:11.030 --> 06:22:11.040 align:start position:0%
you need to be able to defend your loved
 
06:22:11.040 --> 06:22:11.910 align:start position:0%
you need to be able to defend your loved
ones

06:22:11.910 --> 06:22:11.920 align:start position:0%
ones
 
06:22:14.548 --> 06:22:14.558 align:start position:0%
and especially your little ones when
 
06:22:18.310 --> 06:22:18.320 align:start position:0%
you're faced with violent marks
 
06:22:18.320 --> 06:22:19.430 align:start position:0%
you're faced with violent marks
so

06:22:19.430 --> 06:22:19.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:22:21.190 --> 06:22:21.200 align:start position:0%
my testimony is going to be brief i'm
 
06:22:22.470 --> 06:22:22.480 align:start position:0%
i'm done
 
06:22:24.708 --> 06:22:24.718 align:start position:0%
and i
 
06:22:27.270 --> 06:22:27.280 align:start position:0%
i invite you to vote to pass in this
 
06:22:29.350 --> 06:22:29.360 align:start position:0%
bill that clarifies
 
06:22:29.360 --> 06:22:30.470 align:start position:0%
bill that clarifies
the

06:22:30.470 --> 06:22:30.480 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:22:32.788 --> 06:22:32.798 align:start position:0%
need and the right of self-preservation
 
06:22:44.708 --> 06:22:44.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:22:46.390 --> 06:22:46.400 align:start position:0%
seeing no hands raised i want to thank
 
06:22:47.750 --> 06:22:47.760 align:start position:0%
the representative for his testimony and
 
06:22:49.110 --> 06:22:49.120 align:start position:0%

06:22:49.120 --> 06:22:50.230 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your patience as
well

06:22:50.230 --> 06:22:50.240 align:start position:0%

06:22:52.070 --> 06:22:52.080 align:start position:0%
thank you oh excuse me uh
 
06:22:58.868 --> 06:22:58.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:23:00.230 --> 06:23:00.240 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for taking my
 
06:23:01.750 --> 06:23:01.760 align:start position:0%
question um
 
06:23:04.390 --> 06:23:04.400 align:start position:0%
i'm curious when i saw this bill um it
 
06:23:07.910 --> 06:23:07.920 align:start position:0%
really seems to dramatically expand the
 
06:23:07.920 --> 06:23:10.390 align:start position:0%
really seems to dramatically expand the
uh

06:23:10.390 --> 06:23:10.400 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:23:13.510 --> 06:23:13.520 align:start position:0%
the area where a person can claim
 
06:23:15.430 --> 06:23:15.440 align:start position:0%
self-defense and it seems to me as if i
 
06:23:18.070 --> 06:23:18.080 align:start position:0%
read the bill uh anybody who wants to
 
06:23:19.830 --> 06:23:19.840 align:start position:0%
climb into their car
 
06:23:22.070 --> 06:23:22.080 align:start position:0%
um and drive towards a protest and drive
 
06:23:24.470 --> 06:23:24.480 align:start position:0%
slowly towards the protest can actually
 
06:23:26.390 --> 06:23:26.400 align:start position:0%
start shooting at people if they bang on
 
06:23:27.670 --> 06:23:27.680 align:start position:0%
the windows
 
06:23:30.470 --> 06:23:30.480 align:start position:0%
so one of my my concerns about the way
 
06:23:32.868 --> 06:23:32.878 align:start position:0%
that this bill um
 
06:23:35.110 --> 06:23:35.120 align:start position:0%
is framed uh and and frankly that the
 
06:23:36.390 --> 06:23:36.400 align:start position:0%
way that the
 
06:23:39.910 --> 06:23:39.920 align:start position:0%
the wording is uh is is extremely easy
 
06:23:42.628 --> 06:23:42.638 align:start position:0%
to take this wording uh and turn it
 
06:23:42.638 --> 06:23:43.670 align:start position:0%
to take this wording uh and turn it
around

06:23:43.670 --> 06:23:43.680 align:start position:0%
around
 
06:23:46.470 --> 06:23:46.480 align:start position:0%
and to convey a right
 
06:23:48.230 --> 06:23:48.240 align:start position:0%
uh to people that they simply shouldn't
 
06:23:48.240 --> 06:23:55.430 align:start position:0%
uh to people that they simply shouldn't
have

06:23:55.430 --> 06:23:55.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:23:57.190 --> 06:23:57.200 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure whether there's a question
 
06:23:59.430 --> 06:23:59.440 align:start position:0%
but the self-reservation again i'm sorry
 
06:24:02.548 --> 06:24:02.558 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry you can't hear him
 
06:24:05.110 --> 06:24:05.120 align:start position:0%
uh i i apologize i should have asked you
 
06:24:07.430 --> 06:24:07.440 align:start position:0%
that in the form of a question i guess
 
06:24:09.590 --> 06:24:09.600 align:start position:0%
do you share do you share any of those
 
06:24:11.350 --> 06:24:11.360 align:start position:0%
concerns i mean we i think we all saw
 
06:24:14.230 --> 06:24:14.240 align:start position:0%
what took place uh in charlotte
 
06:24:16.070 --> 06:24:16.080 align:start position:0%
i think we've seen that there are people
 
06:24:19.190 --> 06:24:19.200 align:start position:0%
who can provoke these situations
 
06:24:21.590 --> 06:24:21.600 align:start position:0%
are you concerned about that at all as a
 
06:24:23.990 --> 06:24:24.000 align:start position:0%
as an unintended unintended consequence
 
06:24:33.190 --> 06:24:33.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:24:34.788 --> 06:24:34.798 align:start position:0%
you're going to be facing a violent
 
06:24:34.798 --> 06:24:36.708 align:start position:0%
you're going to be facing a violent
attacker

06:24:36.708 --> 06:24:36.718 align:start position:0%
attacker
 
06:24:39.190 --> 06:24:39.200 align:start position:0%
this is what the bill the bill is saying
 
06:24:40.470 --> 06:24:40.480 align:start position:0%
and that's where you're going to resolve
 
06:24:43.750 --> 06:24:43.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:24:47.110 --> 06:24:47.120 align:start position:0%
this is not talking about anything else
 
06:24:52.470 --> 06:24:52.480 align:start position:0%
 
06:24:57.350 --> 06:24:57.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:24:57.360 --> 06:25:00.390 align:start position:0%
 
representative

06:25:00.390 --> 06:25:00.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:25:02.390 --> 06:25:02.400 align:start position:0%
thank you corholm i hope it can be heard
 
06:25:02.400 --> 06:25:03.670 align:start position:0%
thank you corholm i hope it can be heard

06:25:03.670 --> 06:25:03.680 align:start position:0%
online
 
06:25:03.680 --> 06:25:04.548 align:start position:0%
online
um

06:25:04.548 --> 06:25:04.558 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:25:06.310 --> 06:25:06.320 align:start position:0%
i've heard that new hampshire is one of
 
06:25:08.948 --> 06:25:08.958 align:start position:0%
the safest states in the country
 
06:25:10.708 --> 06:25:10.718 align:start position:0%
has there been a change
 
06:25:13.350 --> 06:25:13.360 align:start position:0%
uh such as a rise in the number of
 
06:25:25.910 --> 06:25:25.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:25:27.830 --> 06:25:27.840 align:start position:0%
i believe this is by admission that the
 
06:25:30.470 --> 06:25:30.480 align:start position:0%
law already should have given the rights
 
06:25:33.430 --> 06:25:33.440 align:start position:0%
to people to be able to defend against
 
06:25:37.350 --> 06:25:37.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:25:46.868 --> 06:25:46.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:25:49.990 --> 06:25:50.000 align:start position:0%

um so under um section one
 
06:25:55.600 --> 06:25:56.470 align:start position:0%
um so under um section one
d

06:25:56.470 --> 06:25:56.480 align:start position:0%
d
 
06:25:59.510 --> 06:25:59.520 align:start position:0%
it says it states is likely to use any
 
06:26:02.868 --> 06:26:02.878 align:start position:0%
unlawful force so isn't that basically
 
06:26:05.430 --> 06:26:05.440 align:start position:0%
uh based on an assumption
 
06:26:10.310 --> 06:26:10.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:26:12.548 --> 06:26:12.558 align:start position:0%
uh thank you again we're looking at
 
06:26:14.310 --> 06:26:14.320 align:start position:0%
violent attacks
 
06:26:17.510 --> 06:26:17.520 align:start position:0%
commission over felony
 
06:26:20.230 --> 06:26:20.240 align:start position:0%
this is this is no assumption
 
06:26:33.510 --> 06:26:33.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:26:35.670 --> 06:26:35.680 align:start position:0%

yes my video is simply though
 
06:26:42.310 --> 06:26:42.320 align:start position:0%
if you were a victim of a carjacking
 
06:26:44.708 --> 06:26:44.718 align:start position:0%
you'd be justified in using every boss
 
06:26:46.788 --> 06:26:46.798 align:start position:0%
that's right
 
06:26:49.510 --> 06:26:49.520 align:start position:0%

people using uh
 
06:29:15.110 --> 06:29:15.120 align:start position:0%

car are you then justified to shoot me

i mean i guess
 
06:31:02.468 --> 06:31:02.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:31:05.350 --> 06:31:05.360 align:start position:0%

representative bolden
 
06:31:43.670 --> 06:31:43.680 align:start position:0%
thank you mr parent
 
06:31:45.270 --> 06:31:45.280 align:start position:0%
i was just wondering is there an
 
06:31:46.868 --> 06:31:46.878 align:start position:0%
incident that occurred that inspired
 
06:31:53.910 --> 06:31:53.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:31:55.670 --> 06:31:55.680 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question it's not one
 
06:31:58.390 --> 06:31:58.400 align:start position:0%
incident this whole year i'm sorry 2020
 
06:31:59.350 --> 06:31:59.360 align:start position:0%
has been
 
06:32:01.350 --> 06:32:01.360 align:start position:0%
crazy crazy with everything that's going
 
06:32:02.788 --> 06:32:02.798 align:start position:0%
on everywhere
 
06:32:02.798 --> 06:32:04.230 align:start position:0%
on everywhere
um

06:32:04.230 --> 06:32:04.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:32:06.628 --> 06:32:06.638 align:start position:0%
so i feel that the citizens need to feel
 
06:32:06.638 --> 06:32:08.310 align:start position:0%
so i feel that the citizens need to feel
safer

06:32:08.310 --> 06:32:08.320 align:start position:0%
safer
 
06:32:11.830 --> 06:32:11.840 align:start position:0%
rather than less safe because
 
06:32:11.840 --> 06:32:13.510 align:start position:0%
rather than less safe because
yeah

06:32:13.510 --> 06:32:13.520 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
06:32:15.430 --> 06:32:15.440 align:start position:0%
the whole year has been quite upsetting
 
06:32:17.910 --> 06:32:17.920 align:start position:0%
for many people
 
06:32:31.510 --> 06:32:31.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:32:34.788 --> 06:32:34.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:32:37.750 --> 06:32:37.760 align:start position:0%
thank you chair for taking my question
 
06:32:39.430 --> 06:32:39.440 align:start position:0%
uh thank you representative for taking
 
06:32:41.350 --> 06:32:41.360 align:start position:0%
my question
 
06:32:44.230 --> 06:32:44.240 align:start position:0%
if your goal is to make people feel safe
 
06:32:45.750 --> 06:32:45.760 align:start position:0%
which we just heard
 
06:32:47.750 --> 06:32:47.760 align:start position:0%
how would you feel if you knew most of
 
06:32:49.430 --> 06:32:49.440 align:start position:0%
the population new hampshire would feel
 
06:32:55.110 --> 06:32:55.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:33:02.468 --> 06:33:02.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:33:04.230 --> 06:33:04.240 align:start position:0%
were the women's mind repeating his
 
06:33:04.240 --> 06:33:05.910 align:start position:0%
were the women's mind repeating his
answer

06:33:05.910 --> 06:33:05.920 align:start position:0%
answer
 
06:33:08.150 --> 06:33:08.160 align:start position:0%
i would question the statistics brought
 
06:33:10.468 --> 06:33:10.478 align:start position:0%
forward that most of the population was
 
06:33:13.430 --> 06:33:13.440 align:start position:0%
still unsafe i i don't understand where
 
06:33:21.350 --> 06:33:21.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:33:22.548 --> 06:33:22.558 align:start position:0%
representative now you have a follow-up
 
06:33:22.558 --> 06:33:23.670 align:start position:0%
representative now you have a follow-up
question

06:33:23.670 --> 06:33:23.680 align:start position:0%
question
 
06:33:26.468 --> 06:33:26.478 align:start position:0%
yes chair thank you for recognizing me
 
06:33:29.270 --> 06:33:29.280 align:start position:0%
uh follow-up is what's what statistics
 
06:33:32.868 --> 06:33:32.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:33:34.628 --> 06:33:34.638 align:start position:0%
you said most popular most of the
 
06:33:37.910 --> 06:33:37.920 align:start position:0%
population would feel unsafe so that's
 
06:33:41.110 --> 06:33:41.120 align:start position:0%
well i'm sorry can i clarify chair
 
06:33:43.190 --> 06:33:43.200 align:start position:0%
tonight just let the witness answer
 
06:33:45.350 --> 06:33:45.360 align:start position:0%
answer the finish answering the question
 
06:33:47.750 --> 06:33:47.760 align:start position:0%
if you have a further follow-up question
 
06:33:49.510 --> 06:33:49.520 align:start position:0%
i will i will most certainly recognize
 
06:33:50.708 --> 06:33:50.718 align:start position:0%
you to ask a follow-up question as
 
06:33:52.468 --> 06:33:52.478 align:start position:0%
you've seen i've been
 
06:33:55.030 --> 06:33:55.040 align:start position:0%
recognizing virtually every question
 
06:33:55.040 --> 06:34:01.190 align:start position:0%
recognizing virtually every question
apologies

06:34:01.190 --> 06:34:01.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:34:01.200 --> 06:34:03.510 align:start position:0%
 
um

06:34:03.510 --> 06:34:03.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:34:05.030 --> 06:34:05.040 align:start position:0%
you said that population would feel
 
06:34:05.040 --> 06:34:06.150 align:start position:0%
you said that population would feel
unsafe

06:34:06.150 --> 06:34:06.160 align:start position:0%
unsafe
 
06:34:08.230 --> 06:34:08.240 align:start position:0%
um i don't know where you get that
 
06:34:10.708 --> 06:34:10.718 align:start position:0%
statistics from and i would question the
 
06:34:13.350 --> 06:34:13.360 align:start position:0%
that kind of study
 
06:34:15.510 --> 06:34:15.520 align:start position:0%
that's yeah that's my answer
 
06:34:19.310 --> 06:34:19.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:34:21.190 --> 06:34:21.200 align:start position:0%
representative question
 
06:34:23.590 --> 06:34:23.600 align:start position:0%
yes thank you i just wanted to know
 
06:34:25.510 --> 06:34:25.520 align:start position:0%
because you're talking about how many
 
06:34:28.468 --> 06:34:28.478 align:start position:0%
people feel unsafe that need this so you
 
06:34:31.350 --> 06:34:31.360 align:start position:0%
must i just thought you would have some
 
06:34:39.110 --> 06:34:39.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:34:40.390 --> 06:34:40.400 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry
 
06:34:42.310 --> 06:34:42.320 align:start position:0%
i don't see a question in that
 
06:34:44.948 --> 06:34:44.958 align:start position:0%
do you have the statistics
 
06:34:47.110 --> 06:34:47.120 align:start position:0%
for how many people currently feel
 
06:34:49.350 --> 06:34:49.360 align:start position:0%
unsafe and need this
 
06:34:51.830 --> 06:34:51.840 align:start position:0%
law to pass that will give us a clue on
 
06:34:53.670 --> 06:34:53.680 align:start position:0%
how many people would feel unsafe if it
 
06:35:01.430 --> 06:35:01.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:35:03.430 --> 06:35:03.440 align:start position:0%
to me this law is in the mission in
 
06:35:07.030 --> 06:35:07.040 align:start position:0%
statute that needed clarification
 
06:35:07.040 --> 06:35:07.910 align:start position:0%
statute that needed clarification
so

06:35:07.910 --> 06:35:07.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:35:07.920 --> 06:35:09.110 align:start position:0%
so
it

06:35:09.110 --> 06:35:09.120 align:start position:0%
it
 
06:35:12.948 --> 06:35:12.958 align:start position:0%
if it passes that means it's needed
 
06:35:12.958 --> 06:35:13.830 align:start position:0%
if it passes that means it's needed
that's

06:35:13.830 --> 06:35:13.840 align:start position:0%
that's
 
06:35:15.350 --> 06:35:15.360 align:start position:0%
that's what i'm gonna go by those are
 
06:35:15.360 --> 06:35:16.788 align:start position:0%
that's what i'm gonna go by those are
the

06:35:16.788 --> 06:35:16.798 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:35:23.430 --> 06:35:23.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:35:27.270 --> 06:35:27.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:35:28.548 --> 06:35:28.558 align:start position:0%

um
 
06:35:33.670 --> 06:35:33.680 align:start position:0%
it says here commission of riot um
 
06:35:35.350 --> 06:35:35.360 align:start position:0%
can you tell me
 
06:35:35.360 --> 06:35:36.948 align:start position:0%
can you tell me
um

06:35:36.948 --> 06:35:36.958 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:35:38.468 --> 06:35:38.478 align:start position:0%
or describe to me what you're
 
06:35:40.468 --> 06:35:40.478 align:start position:0%
considering my right to be
 
06:35:40.478 --> 06:35:41.510 align:start position:0%
considering my right to be
and

06:35:41.510 --> 06:35:41.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:35:44.948 --> 06:35:44.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:35:46.868 --> 06:35:46.878 align:start position:0%
the definition is that you are saying
 
06:35:49.190 --> 06:35:49.200 align:start position:0%
the book the german hand
 
06:35:50.548 --> 06:35:50.558 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry you don't want to be with me
 
06:35:51.990 --> 06:35:52.000 align:start position:0%
but to me any
 
06:35:55.430 --> 06:35:55.440 align:start position:0%
um attack a violent attacker
 
06:35:57.670 --> 06:35:57.680 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry
 
06:35:58.830 --> 06:35:58.840 align:start position:0%
say it one more
 
06:36:01.350 --> 06:36:01.360 align:start position:0%
time i'm saying the definition is any
 
06:36:03.670 --> 06:36:03.680 align:start position:0%
recipe we're gonna go by the definition
 
06:36:05.670 --> 06:36:05.680 align:start position:0%
when the wall was drafted that's what i
 
06:36:06.788 --> 06:36:06.798 align:start position:0%
was looking at
 
06:36:06.798 --> 06:36:07.590 align:start position:0%
was looking at
so

06:36:07.590 --> 06:36:07.600 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:36:08.948 --> 06:36:08.958 align:start position:0%
if you have access to it you can take a
 
06:36:11.830 --> 06:36:11.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:36:16.070 --> 06:36:16.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:36:18.070 --> 06:36:18.080 align:start position:0%
well there is a legal definition on the
 
06:36:18.080 --> 06:36:19.350 align:start position:0%
well there is a legal definition on the
books

06:36:19.350 --> 06:36:19.360 align:start position:0%
books
 
06:36:25.690 --> 06:36:25.700 align:start position:0%
 
06:36:25.700 --> 06:36:29.190 align:start position:0%

06:36:29.190 --> 06:36:29.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:36:30.390 --> 06:36:30.400 align:start position:0%
i believe our representative gaffit does
 
06:36:37.190 --> 06:36:37.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:36:38.948 --> 06:36:38.958 align:start position:0%
that's the black swat dictionary i think
 
06:36:41.430 --> 06:36:41.440 align:start position:0%
it might be an rsa
 
06:36:44.150 --> 06:36:44.160 align:start position:0%
hopefully they're similar but they may
 
06:36:46.390 --> 06:36:46.400 align:start position:0%
my follow-up this um
 
06:36:48.070 --> 06:36:48.080 align:start position:0%
okay um
 
06:36:49.190 --> 06:36:49.200 align:start position:0%
have you
 
06:36:50.948 --> 06:36:50.958 align:start position:0%
been a part of
 
06:36:54.310 --> 06:36:54.320 align:start position:0%
or seen a right here that kind of fits
 
06:36:59.990 --> 06:37:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:37:02.548 --> 06:37:02.558 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire
 
06:37:04.868 --> 06:37:04.878 align:start position:0%
i have not been a part of any violent
 
06:37:08.830 --> 06:37:08.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:37:10.708 --> 06:37:10.718 align:start position:0%
and so
 
06:37:12.230 --> 06:37:12.240 align:start position:0%
yeah in the right the definition of
 
06:37:13.830 --> 06:37:13.840 align:start position:0%
writers in the rsa it's not my
 
06:37:13.840 --> 06:37:18.628 align:start position:0%
writers in the rsa it's not my
definition

06:37:18.628 --> 06:37:18.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:37:18.638 --> 06:37:19.910 align:start position:0%
 
representative

06:37:19.910 --> 06:37:19.920 align:start position:0%
representative
 
06:37:22.948 --> 06:37:22.958 align:start position:0%
question okay my question is have you
 
06:37:24.788 --> 06:37:24.798 align:start position:0%
been apart or
 
06:37:24.798 --> 06:37:26.070 align:start position:0%
been apart or
seen

06:37:26.070 --> 06:37:26.080 align:start position:0%
seen
 
06:37:29.110 --> 06:37:29.120 align:start position:0%
a riot here i just read the definition

particularly in terms of
 
06:37:40.070 --> 06:37:40.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:37:42.310 --> 06:37:42.320 align:start position:0%
that's the question right right i i got
 
06:37:46.468 --> 06:37:46.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:37:48.390 --> 06:37:48.400 align:start position:0%

thank you for this opportunity to
 
06:41:05.430 --> 06:41:05.440 align:start position:0%
testify my name is lois cody i'm a
 
06:41:07.510 --> 06:41:07.520 align:start position:0%
resident of manchester to volunteer with
 
06:41:09.830 --> 06:41:09.840 align:start position:0%
mom's demand action speaking today to
 
06:41:13.030 --> 06:41:13.040 align:start position:0%
urge you to oppose house bill 197
 
06:41:15.830 --> 06:41:15.840 align:start position:0%
in changing new hampshire rsa 627 colon
 
06:41:19.350 --> 06:41:19.360 align:start position:0%
4 section c and d and adding section e
 
06:41:21.990 --> 06:41:22.000 align:start position:0%
house bill 197 extends the potential
 
06:41:24.150 --> 06:41:24.160 align:start position:0%
area where a person can shoot to kill in
 
06:41:25.990 --> 06:41:26.000 align:start position:0%
public to the entire community
 
06:41:28.468 --> 06:41:28.478 align:start position:0%
additionally under the new section e for
 
06:41:31.270 --> 06:41:31.280 align:start position:0%
example three people rushing to aid a
 
06:41:33.830 --> 06:41:33.840 align:start position:0%
person or persons screaming in distress
 
06:41:35.910 --> 06:41:35.920 align:start position:0%
in any given setting
 
06:41:37.670 --> 06:41:37.680 align:start position:0%
could be mistaken for committing riot
 
06:41:39.750 --> 06:41:39.760 align:start position:0%
and shot or killed these changes would
 
06:41:41.510 --> 06:41:41.520 align:start position:0%
open the door to unnecessarily and
 
06:41:43.590 --> 06:41:43.600 align:start position:0%
recklessly using deadly force in
 
06:41:45.190 --> 06:41:45.200 align:start position:0%
circumstances where there are clear
 
06:41:47.430 --> 06:41:47.440 align:start position:0%
alternatives to violent response
 
06:41:49.590 --> 06:41:49.600 align:start position:0%
under this stand your ground statute the
 
06:41:51.430 --> 06:41:51.440 align:start position:0%
already narrowly drawn prohibitions
 
06:41:52.948 --> 06:41:52.958 align:start position:0%
against use of deadly force are
 
06:41:55.270 --> 06:41:55.280 align:start position:0%
seriously undermined additionally by the
 
06:41:59.190 --> 06:41:59.200 align:start position:0%
phrase in 627 colon 4 part 3 section 8
 
06:42:01.910 --> 06:42:01.920 align:start position:0%
quote or anywhere he or she has a right
 
06:42:02.948 --> 06:42:02.958 align:start position:0%
to be
 
06:42:06.230 --> 06:42:06.240 align:start position:0%
hb 197 greatly expands this anywhere
 
06:42:08.628 --> 06:42:08.638 align:start position:0%
seriously undermining people's sense of
 
06:42:10.788 --> 06:42:10.798 align:start position:0%
individual and public safety especially
 
06:42:12.708 --> 06:42:12.718 align:start position:0%
in times of severe stress and high
 
06:42:15.270 --> 06:42:15.280 align:start position:0%
anxiety as we are living currently
 
06:42:17.110 --> 06:42:17.120 align:start position:0%
as a retired child and family mental
 
06:42:18.788 --> 06:42:18.798 align:start position:0%
health counselor i am paying close
 
06:42:20.548 --> 06:42:20.558 align:start position:0%
attention with great concern to the
 
06:42:22.948 --> 06:42:22.958 align:start position:0%
escalating levels of depression anxiety
 
06:42:25.030 --> 06:42:25.040 align:start position:0%
suicidal ideation and suicide
 
06:42:28.150 --> 06:42:28.160 align:start position:0%
particularly among those 18 to 24.
 
06:42:31.030 --> 06:42:31.040 align:start position:0%
passage of house bill 197 would lead to
 
06:42:32.548 --> 06:42:32.558 align:start position:0%
increases in public shootings and
 
06:42:34.948 --> 06:42:34.958 align:start position:0%
killings creating ever greater stress
 
06:42:36.788 --> 06:42:36.798 align:start position:0%
anxiety and depression among the young
 
06:42:38.868 --> 06:42:38.878 align:start position:0%
people who grew up having to experience
 
06:42:41.750 --> 06:42:41.760 align:start position:0%
routine lockdown drills at school to add
 
06:42:44.070 --> 06:42:44.080 align:start position:0%
fear of possibly
 
06:42:45.750 --> 06:42:45.760 align:start position:0%
we do have to limit testimony to two
 
06:42:45.760 --> 06:42:51.430 align:start position:0%
we do have to limit testimony to two
minutes

06:42:51.430 --> 06:42:51.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:42:53.510 --> 06:42:53.520 align:start position:0%
so i'll just ask you conclude the
 
06:42:53.520 --> 06:43:08.310 align:start position:0%
so i'll just ask you conclude the
representation

06:43:08.310 --> 06:43:08.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:43:11.350 --> 06:43:11.360 align:start position:0%
did you want me to say more
 
06:43:12.948 --> 06:43:12.958 align:start position:0%
you've exceeded the time limit but i do
 
06:43:14.628 --> 06:43:14.638 align:start position:0%
offer the members the public the
 
06:43:18.390 --> 06:43:18.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:43:22.310 --> 06:43:22.320 align:start position:0%
well okay i ask you to please uh vote no
 
06:43:27.910 --> 06:43:27.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:43:29.510 --> 06:43:29.520 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony uh
 
06:43:30.948 --> 06:43:30.958 align:start position:0%
representative knight you've
 
06:43:32.708 --> 06:43:32.718 align:start position:0%
been recognized for a question
 
06:43:35.750 --> 06:43:35.760 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman and thank you
 
06:43:37.990 --> 06:43:38.000 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
 
06:43:38.000 --> 06:43:39.590 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
um

06:43:39.590 --> 06:43:39.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:43:42.628 --> 06:43:42.638 align:start position:0%
my question is in terms of data that the
 
06:43:44.468 --> 06:43:44.478 align:start position:0%
representative mentioned since we don't
 
06:43:47.030 --> 06:43:47.040 align:start position:0%
have a lot to go off of
 
06:43:50.070 --> 06:43:50.080 align:start position:0%
of people who feel safe or unsafe if
 
06:43:52.708 --> 06:43:52.718 align:start position:0%
this were to pass do you believe that
 
06:43:55.030 --> 06:43:55.040 align:start position:0%
the sign in sheet after this bill will
 
06:43:56.948 --> 06:43:56.958 align:start position:0%
it would be a good reflection of the
 
06:44:01.110 --> 06:44:01.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:44:03.990 --> 06:44:04.000 align:start position:0%
i i can't uh judge that and i i don't
 
06:44:06.310 --> 06:44:06.320 align:start position:0%
have a way to collect data but i would
 
06:44:09.030 --> 06:44:09.040 align:start position:0%
say that those numbers do mean that
 
06:44:11.350 --> 06:44:11.360 align:start position:0%
people are very concerned
 
06:44:12.468 --> 06:44:12.478 align:start position:0%
that this
 
06:44:14.628 --> 06:44:14.638 align:start position:0%
bill will lead to
 
06:44:17.030 --> 06:44:17.040 align:start position:0%
people feeling very much less safe and
 
06:44:23.030 --> 06:44:23.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:44:24.468 --> 06:44:24.478 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:44:34.070 --> 06:44:34.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:44:35.590 --> 06:44:35.600 align:start position:0%
seeing no questions i want to thank the
 
06:44:48.548 --> 06:44:48.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:44:56.788 --> 06:44:56.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:44:58.948 --> 06:44:58.958 align:start position:0%
yes hello thank you chair thank you for
 
06:45:00.788 --> 06:45:00.798 align:start position:0%
uh taking my question or thank you for
 
06:45:02.390 --> 06:45:02.400 align:start position:0%
uh listening to me
 
06:45:04.150 --> 06:45:04.160 align:start position:0%
uh for the record my name is
 
06:45:05.910 --> 06:45:05.920 align:start position:0%
representative tony kaplan from
 
06:45:07.750 --> 06:45:07.760 align:start position:0%
merrimack six which is the towns of
 
06:45:09.990 --> 06:45:10.000 align:start position:0%
henneker and bradford
 
06:45:12.788 --> 06:45:12.798 align:start position:0%
we heard today earlier in testimony that
 
06:45:14.548 --> 06:45:14.558 align:start position:0%
skateboards could constitute a deadly
 
06:45:14.558 --> 06:45:16.868 align:start position:0%
skateboards could constitute a deadly
weapon

06:45:16.868 --> 06:45:16.878 align:start position:0%
weapon
 
06:45:19.430 --> 06:45:19.440 align:start position:0%
so my fear is that
 
06:45:21.350 --> 06:45:21.360 align:start position:0%
legal definition of a riot is so
 
06:45:23.670 --> 06:45:23.680 align:start position:0%
subjective a notion
 
06:45:26.310 --> 06:45:26.320 align:start position:0%
that it will inevitably lead to attacks
 
06:45:27.990 --> 06:45:28.000 align:start position:0%
on our rights of assembly and free
 
06:45:29.990 --> 06:45:30.000 align:start position:0%
speech the rights of community groups
 
06:45:32.150 --> 06:45:32.160 align:start position:0%
and citizen groups to lawfully protest
 
06:45:35.350 --> 06:45:35.360 align:start position:0%
and assemble without fear in effect it's
 
06:45:36.708 --> 06:45:36.718 align:start position:0%
a declaration of war on our
 
06:45:38.548 --> 06:45:38.558 align:start position:0%
constitutional rights and traditions of
 
06:45:39.830 --> 06:45:39.840 align:start position:0%
tolerance and respect for the
 
06:45:43.350 --> 06:45:43.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:45:44.948 --> 06:45:44.958 align:start position:0%
as other people i'm wondering what
 
06:45:47.830 --> 06:45:47.840 align:start position:0%
problem is this bill attempting to solve
 
06:45:50.070 --> 06:45:50.080 align:start position:0%
are our streets and highways so lawless
 
06:45:51.510 --> 06:45:51.520 align:start position:0%
that we need to enable private
 
06:45:53.830 --> 06:45:53.840 align:start position:0%
vigilantes in new hampshire
 
06:45:56.390 --> 06:45:56.400 align:start position:0%
i don't think so
 
06:45:58.390 --> 06:45:58.400 align:start position:0%
this proposed law would make us less
 
06:46:00.628 --> 06:46:00.638 align:start position:0%
safe uh stand your ground laws lead to
 
06:46:02.628 --> 06:46:02.638 align:start position:0%
greater homo homosize greater gun deaths
 
06:46:04.070 --> 06:46:04.080 align:start position:0%
and greater tragedies and traumas
 
06:46:06.788 --> 06:46:06.798 align:start position:0%
inflicted on the citizenry so i would
 
06:46:08.948 --> 06:46:08.958 align:start position:0%
urge you to oppose this law and vote in
 
06:46:10.548 --> 06:46:10.558 align:start position:0%
expedient to legislate
 
06:46:15.590 --> 06:46:15.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:46:16.788 --> 06:46:16.798 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for your
 
06:46:16.798 --> 06:46:23.350 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for your
testimony

06:46:23.350 --> 06:46:23.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:46:32.230 --> 06:46:32.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:46:34.628 --> 06:46:34.638 align:start position:0%
hi hello um again
 
06:46:34.638 --> 06:46:36.788 align:start position:0%
hi hello um again
um

06:46:36.788 --> 06:46:36.798 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:46:39.030 --> 06:46:39.040 align:start position:0%
so my name is eric perez i'm with new
 
06:46:40.628 --> 06:46:40.638 align:start position:0%
hampshire youth movement and i'm here to
 
06:46:40.638 --> 06:46:41.708 align:start position:0%
hampshire youth movement and i'm here to
oppose

06:46:41.708 --> 06:46:41.718 align:start position:0%
oppose
 
06:46:45.590 --> 06:46:45.600 align:start position:0%
hb197 and hb145
 
06:46:47.670 --> 06:46:47.680 align:start position:0%
respectfully we have spent all day
 
06:46:49.430 --> 06:46:49.440 align:start position:0%
talking about how things don't happen in
 
06:46:50.628 --> 06:46:50.638 align:start position:0%
new hampshire like they do in other
 
06:46:52.468 --> 06:46:52.478 align:start position:0%
cities and now that we're talking about
 
06:46:54.230 --> 06:46:54.240 align:start position:0%
gun rights here come all the fantastical
 
06:46:57.110 --> 06:46:57.120 align:start position:0%
stories of home invasions and danger
 
06:46:59.270 --> 06:46:59.280 align:start position:0%
when we are the third lowest state in
 
06:47:02.468 --> 06:47:02.478 align:start position:0%
violent crime in the country these bills
 
06:47:05.110 --> 06:47:05.120 align:start position:0%
are less often used as a defense of
 
06:47:07.270 --> 06:47:07.280 align:start position:0%
self-defense on someone's property and
 
06:47:08.948 --> 06:47:08.958 align:start position:0%
more often used as a protection to
 
06:47:11.270 --> 06:47:11.280 align:start position:0%
people who murder people in a way that
 
06:47:12.708 --> 06:47:12.718 align:start position:0%
they find justified like george
 
06:47:15.270 --> 06:47:15.280 align:start position:0%
zimmerman and i think we can all agree
 
06:47:16.548 --> 06:47:16.558 align:start position:0%
that you should be able to defend
 
06:47:18.230 --> 06:47:18.240 align:start position:0%
yourself on your property and i believe
 
06:47:20.310 --> 06:47:20.320 align:start position:0%
in self-defense and gun rights because i
 
06:47:21.590 --> 06:47:21.600 align:start position:0%
believe that's something that people of
 
06:47:23.110 --> 06:47:23.120 align:start position:0%
color should have
 
06:47:25.510 --> 06:47:25.520 align:start position:0%
the right to defend themselves but sadly
 
06:47:27.670 --> 06:47:27.680 align:start position:0%
these laws tend to not protect us from
 
06:47:30.070 --> 06:47:30.080 align:start position:0%
incarceration like centolia brown who
 
06:47:31.830 --> 06:47:31.840 align:start position:0%
served 15 years after killing a man who
 
06:47:34.070 --> 06:47:34.080 align:start position:0%
human trafficked her when she was 16.
 
06:47:35.510 --> 06:47:35.520 align:start position:0%
that being said
 
06:47:37.670 --> 06:47:37.680 align:start position:0%
um don't act like the point of bias and
 
06:47:39.510 --> 06:47:39.520 align:start position:0%
feelings people are making are relevant
 
06:47:41.510 --> 06:47:41.520 align:start position:0%
when in may after the first plm march in
 
06:47:44.230 --> 06:47:44.240 align:start position:0%
manchester two men pointed and attempted
 
06:47:46.468 --> 06:47:46.478 align:start position:0%
to shoot a gun at a group of protesters
 
06:47:48.310 --> 06:47:48.320 align:start position:0%
out of sheer anger in front of the
 
06:47:51.270 --> 06:47:51.280 align:start position:0%
police this law would defend them
 
06:47:53.110 --> 06:47:53.120 align:start position:0%
there's so much that's already covered
 
06:47:54.628 --> 06:47:54.638 align:start position:0%
in the current stand your ground laws
 
06:47:57.030 --> 06:47:57.040 align:start position:0%
that we already have and we do not need
 
06:47:59.110 --> 06:47:59.120 align:start position:0%
to extend that right to shoot someone
 
06:48:01.030 --> 06:48:01.040 align:start position:0%
there is plenty of protection already in
 
06:48:02.548 --> 06:48:02.558 align:start position:0%
our laws and new hampshire is not the
 
06:48:04.070 --> 06:48:04.080 align:start position:0%
wild west you should not be allowed to
 
06:48:06.070 --> 06:48:06.080 align:start position:0%
kill someone just because you're scared
 
06:48:08.390 --> 06:48:08.400 align:start position:0%
this is how innocent people get killed
 
06:48:11.430 --> 06:48:11.440 align:start position:0%
do the right thing retain these bills
 
06:48:18.070 --> 06:48:18.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:48:19.270 --> 06:48:19.280 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony and your
 
06:48:19.280 --> 06:48:25.830 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony and your
patience

06:48:25.830 --> 06:48:25.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:48:25.840 --> 06:48:26.788 align:start position:0%
 
see

06:48:26.788 --> 06:48:26.798 align:start position:0%
see
 
06:48:30.230 --> 06:48:30.240 align:start position:0%
seeing no hands raised excuse me
 
06:48:32.150 --> 06:48:32.160 align:start position:0%
representative knight
 
06:48:34.390 --> 06:48:34.400 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman and thank you erica
 
06:48:38.390 --> 06:48:38.400 align:start position:0%
for taking my testimony um i just have a
 
06:48:41.270 --> 06:48:41.280 align:start position:0%
question based off of your testimony and
 
06:48:43.750 --> 06:48:43.760 align:start position:0%
other bills we've heard too do you know
 
06:48:46.468 --> 06:48:46.478 align:start position:0%
what happened or how the conviction of
 
06:48:48.548 --> 06:48:48.558 align:start position:0%
those two men if that's out of order i
 
06:48:51.030 --> 06:48:51.040 align:start position:0%
apologize but we've heard other uh
 
06:48:53.110 --> 06:48:53.120 align:start position:0%
testimony on on sentencing
 
06:48:55.830 --> 06:48:55.840 align:start position:0%
reform and i i just wanted to know i was
 
06:48:59.350 --> 06:48:59.360 align:start position:0%
curious were they punished
 
06:49:01.270 --> 06:49:01.280 align:start position:0%
your question is not out of work
 
06:49:02.788 --> 06:49:02.798 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:49:04.548 --> 06:49:04.558 align:start position:0%
okay awesome i'm glad it's not out of
 
06:49:05.910 --> 06:49:05.920 align:start position:0%
order because i do want to answer it
 
06:49:07.830 --> 06:49:07.840 align:start position:0%
currently they aren't protected by any
 
06:49:10.390 --> 06:49:10.400 align:start position:0%
laws so they were in fact endangering
 
06:49:12.628 --> 06:49:12.638 align:start position:0%
people and are currently in the process
 
06:49:15.110 --> 06:49:15.120 align:start position:0%
of being charged i don't know for what
 
06:49:17.190 --> 06:49:17.200 align:start position:0%
and they haven't been yet incarcerated
 
06:49:20.070 --> 06:49:20.080 align:start position:0%
but they are facing a few years for what
 
06:49:23.270 --> 06:49:23.280 align:start position:0%
they did because it was an attempt of
 
06:49:25.510 --> 06:49:25.520 align:start position:0%
murder they were trying to hurt people
 
06:49:29.510 --> 06:49:29.520 align:start position:0%

okay thank you um members of the
 
06:50:50.230 --> 06:50:50.240 align:start position:0%

licensed attorney i'm licensed in maine

06:51:01.030 --> 06:51:01.040 align:start position:0%
hampshire the district court of maine
 
06:51:03.110 --> 06:51:03.120 align:start position:0%
the district court of massachusetts the
 
06:51:05.110 --> 06:51:05.120 align:start position:0%
first circuit court of appeals the new
 
06:51:06.868 --> 06:51:06.878 align:start position:0%
hampshire supreme court in the d.c
 
06:51:09.910 --> 06:51:09.920 align:start position:0%
circuit and i'm an active litigator and
 
06:51:12.468 --> 06:51:12.478 align:start position:0%
i'm neutral on the bill's language
 
06:51:13.830 --> 06:51:13.840 align:start position:0%
because i think it should be stronger
 
06:51:15.590 --> 06:51:15.600 align:start position:0%
but this is an excellent bill that's
 
06:51:17.830 --> 06:51:17.840 align:start position:0%
absolutely needed
 
06:51:20.150 --> 06:51:20.160 align:start position:0%
and when i hear people talk about we're
 
06:51:22.868 --> 06:51:22.878 align:start position:0%
the third lowest in violent crime
 
06:51:24.708 --> 06:51:24.718 align:start position:0%
you might want to tell that to the x
 
06:51:26.708 --> 06:51:26.718 align:start position:0%
number of rapes assaults and murders
 
06:51:28.070 --> 06:51:28.080 align:start position:0%
that we've had here and you tell the
 
06:51:30.070 --> 06:51:30.080 align:start position:0%
person that's been raped oh don't worry
 
06:51:33.110 --> 06:51:33.120 align:start position:0%
new hampshire safest in the state nation
 
06:51:34.708 --> 06:51:34.718 align:start position:0%
that might be true but that gives them
 
06:51:36.070 --> 06:51:36.080 align:start position:0%
no comfort
 
06:51:38.468 --> 06:51:38.478 align:start position:0%
and so we need this bill to protect
 
06:51:40.948 --> 06:51:40.958 align:start position:0%
people and to allow people to defend
 
06:51:43.670 --> 06:51:43.680 align:start position:0%
themselves my only concern is i don't
 
06:51:46.948 --> 06:51:46.958 align:start position:0%
think the language goes far enough
 
06:51:49.110 --> 06:51:49.120 align:start position:0%
because the language the statutory
 
06:51:51.190 --> 06:51:51.200 align:start position:0%
language of riot
 
06:51:53.430 --> 06:51:53.440 align:start position:0%
which is 644
 
06:51:55.750 --> 06:51:55.760 align:start position:0%
colon one
 
06:51:55.760 --> 06:51:57.190 align:start position:0%
colon one
roman

06:51:57.190 --> 06:51:57.200 align:start position:0%

06:51:59.510 --> 06:51:59.520 align:start position:0%
c
 
06:52:02.468 --> 06:52:02.478 align:start position:0%
sub c says he assembles with two or more
 
06:52:04.628 --> 06:52:04.638 align:start position:0%
persons with the purpose of committing
 
06:52:07.030 --> 06:52:07.040 align:start position:0%
offense against the person or property
 
06:52:09.270 --> 06:52:09.280 align:start position:0%
of another whom he supposes to be guilty
 
06:52:12.390 --> 06:52:12.400 align:start position:0%
and it goes on and on so i think
 
06:52:14.548 --> 06:52:14.558 align:start position:0%
that a lawyer i hate to say it is going
 
06:52:16.708 --> 06:52:16.718 align:start position:0%
to find a lot of wiggle room to defend
 
06:52:19.190 --> 06:52:19.200 align:start position:0%
defendants in cases like this so in the
 
06:52:21.190 --> 06:52:21.200 align:start position:0%
sense of supporting the concept of the
 
06:52:24.948 --> 06:52:24.958 align:start position:0%
bill absolutely and i think
 
06:52:28.708 --> 06:52:28.718 align:start position:0%
c or i'm sorry d rather of the proposed
 
06:52:31.590 --> 06:52:31.600 align:start position:0%
bill is good because it allows a person
 
06:52:34.310 --> 06:52:34.320 align:start position:0%
to defend others because right now the
 
06:52:37.350 --> 06:52:37.360 align:start position:0%
way it is worded it arguably only allows
 
06:52:39.990 --> 06:52:40.000 align:start position:0%
you to defend yourself it doesn't allow
 
06:52:40.000 --> 06:52:40.788 align:start position:0%
you to defend yourself it doesn't allow
you

06:52:40.788 --> 06:52:40.798 align:start position:0%
you
 
06:52:42.788 --> 06:52:42.798 align:start position:0%
to defend your children your wife your
 
06:53:01.590 --> 06:53:01.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:53:04.390 --> 06:53:04.400 align:start position:0%
yes sir i apologize um lawyer and a
 
06:53:06.468 --> 06:53:06.478 align:start position:0%
woman is double talking long so the gist
 
06:53:08.548 --> 06:53:08.558 align:start position:0%
of it is if you are ever in the
 
06:53:10.390 --> 06:53:10.400 align:start position:0%
defendant's seat having to defend your
 
06:53:12.468 --> 06:53:12.478 align:start position:0%
life you would like this bill or a
 
06:53:14.868 --> 06:53:14.878 align:start position:0%
version stronger trust me
 
06:53:18.390 --> 06:53:18.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:53:20.468 --> 06:53:20.478 align:start position:0%
thank you and i'm happy to answer any
 
06:53:20.478 --> 06:53:21.670 align:start position:0%
thank you and i'm happy to answer any
questions

06:53:21.670 --> 06:53:21.680 align:start position:0%
questions
 
06:53:23.270 --> 06:53:23.280 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your testimony
 
06:53:23.280 --> 06:53:24.310 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your testimony
uh

06:53:24.310 --> 06:53:24.320 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:53:26.150 --> 06:53:26.160 align:start position:0%
representative bradley
 
06:53:27.750 --> 06:53:27.760 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman
 
06:53:30.310 --> 06:53:30.320 align:start position:0%
um thank you penny for coming to testify
 
06:53:30.320 --> 06:53:31.190 align:start position:0%
um thank you penny for coming to testify
um

06:53:31.190 --> 06:53:31.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:53:33.750 --> 06:53:33.760 align:start position:0%
you mentioned section d
 
06:53:36.230 --> 06:53:36.240 align:start position:0%
does it concern you that it states is
 
06:53:38.788 --> 06:53:38.798 align:start position:0%
likely to use an unlawful force so
 
06:53:42.868 --> 06:53:42.878 align:start position:0%
instead of being able to confirm
 
06:53:45.670 --> 06:53:45.680 align:start position:0%
um unlawful force you're using an
 
06:53:47.670 --> 06:53:47.680 align:start position:0%
assumption and that assumption can be
 
06:53:49.990 --> 06:53:50.000 align:start position:0%
based on anything
 
06:53:52.070 --> 06:53:52.080 align:start position:0%
well no it doesn't concern me at all
 
06:53:54.390 --> 06:53:54.400 align:start position:0%
because let me tell you an another thing
 
06:53:56.628 --> 06:53:56.638 align:start position:0%
that a lot of people do not understand
 
06:53:58.948 --> 06:53:58.958 align:start position:0%
new hampshire does not have a stand your
 
06:54:01.750 --> 06:54:01.760 align:start position:0%
ground law i wish it did it does not we
 
06:54:03.430 --> 06:54:03.440 align:start position:0%
have what's called an affirmative
 
06:54:05.590 --> 06:54:05.600 align:start position:0%
defense and here's what it means if you
 
06:54:07.990 --> 06:54:08.000 align:start position:0%
are charged with a crime and you raise
 
06:54:09.990 --> 06:54:10.000 align:start position:0%
enough facts before a judge because a
 
06:54:12.548 --> 06:54:12.558 align:start position:0%
judge makes this determination a judge
 
06:54:14.230 --> 06:54:14.240 align:start position:0%
will allow you to raise what's called an
 
06:54:15.910 --> 06:54:15.920 align:start position:0%
affirmative defense which is what's
 
06:54:17.830 --> 06:54:17.840 align:start position:0%
found in this bill and so you're going
 
06:54:20.548 --> 06:54:20.558 align:start position:0%
to have to give the judge facts
 
06:54:22.868 --> 06:54:22.878 align:start position:0%
that the person what likely meant in
 
06:54:23.990 --> 06:54:24.000 align:start position:0%
other words if someone's walking
 
06:54:25.590 --> 06:54:25.600 align:start position:0%
peacefully by you and whistling you're
 
06:54:27.510 --> 06:54:27.520 align:start position:0%
not going to convince any judge that i
 
06:54:30.548 --> 06:54:30.558 align:start position:0%
know that the person was going to
 
06:54:32.708 --> 06:54:32.718 align:start position:0%
commit an unlawful act against you
 
06:54:34.548 --> 06:54:34.558 align:start position:0%
you're going to have to put forth facts
 
06:54:36.788 --> 06:54:36.798 align:start position:0%
that say the man had a bad over his head
 
06:54:38.708 --> 06:54:38.718 align:start position:0%
and was calling me bad names and said
 
06:54:40.070 --> 06:54:40.080 align:start position:0%
i'm going gonna punch you in the head
 
06:54:41.270 --> 06:54:41.280 align:start position:0%
with my bat
 
06:54:45.510 --> 06:54:45.520 align:start position:0%
so likely is actually a word that i wish
 
06:54:48.628 --> 06:54:48.638 align:start position:0%
was even weaker because you have to be
 
06:54:50.548 --> 06:54:50.558 align:start position:0%
able to articulate in the spur of the
 
06:54:53.190 --> 06:54:53.200 align:start position:0%
moment bad facts and we have a saying
 
06:54:56.150 --> 06:54:56.160 align:start position:0%
for the supreme court that says detached
 
06:54:58.628 --> 06:54:58.638 align:start position:0%
reflection is not required
 
06:55:00.468 --> 06:55:00.478 align:start position:0%
you know in the face of an upraised
 
06:55:03.430 --> 06:55:03.440 align:start position:0%
knife and i'm um paraphrasing the
 
06:55:05.430 --> 06:55:05.440 align:start position:0%
statute or i'm sorry paraphrasing the
 
06:55:07.510 --> 06:55:07.520 align:start position:0%
phrase from a supreme court justice and
 
06:55:09.110 --> 06:55:09.120 align:start position:0%
what he's basically saying is when
 
06:55:11.350 --> 06:55:11.360 align:start position:0%
someone attacks you you don't or is
 
06:55:13.270 --> 06:55:13.280 align:start position:0%
going to attack you eminently you don't
 
06:55:15.190 --> 06:55:15.200 align:start position:0%
have time to debate oh is he strong
 
06:55:16.948 --> 06:55:16.958 align:start position:0%
enough to hurt me all this or that
 
06:55:18.390 --> 06:55:18.400 align:start position:0%
you're afraid for your life and you have
 
06:55:20.230 --> 06:55:20.240 align:start position:0%
to defend yourself so with all due
 
06:55:22.548 --> 06:55:22.558 align:start position:0%
respect um representative
 
06:55:24.230 --> 06:55:24.240 align:start position:0%
i think that they're going to go back to
 
06:55:26.708 --> 06:55:26.718 align:start position:0%
the reasonable person standard and we're
 
06:55:28.708 --> 06:55:28.718 align:start position:0%
going to look at
 
06:55:30.868 --> 06:55:30.878 align:start position:0%
is that person reasonable in other words
 
06:55:31.990 --> 06:55:32.000 align:start position:0%
if you have a two-year-old saying i'm
 
06:55:33.830 --> 06:55:33.840 align:start position:0%
going to hit you with my balloon
 
06:55:35.270 --> 06:55:35.280 align:start position:0%
no judge on planet earth it's going to
 
06:55:36.628 --> 06:55:36.638 align:start position:0%
allow you to raise an affirmative
 
06:55:38.310 --> 06:55:38.320 align:start position:0%
defense here you're going to be charged
 
06:55:41.190 --> 06:55:41.200 align:start position:0%
under the criminal code unfortunately
 
06:55:43.910 --> 06:55:43.920 align:start position:0%
this is still this defense which is not
 
06:55:45.590 --> 06:55:45.600 align:start position:0%
a stand your ground it's an affirmative
 
06:55:47.510 --> 06:55:47.520 align:start position:0%
defense after you've been charged it
 
06:55:49.430 --> 06:55:49.440 align:start position:0%
doesn't prevent you from being charged
 
06:55:51.670 --> 06:55:51.680 align:start position:0%
which is what true stand your ground law
 
06:55:51.680 --> 06:55:53.670 align:start position:0%
which is what true stand your ground law
does

06:55:53.670 --> 06:55:53.680 align:start position:0%
does
 
06:55:55.910 --> 06:55:55.920 align:start position:0%
this still is up to the given judge and
 
06:55:57.830 --> 06:55:57.840 align:start position:0%
remember we do not elect judges in this
 
06:55:59.670 --> 06:55:59.680 align:start position:0%
state we appoint them
 
06:56:01.590 --> 06:56:01.600 align:start position:0%
and so therefore a given judge says you
 
06:56:03.190 --> 06:56:03.200 align:start position:0%
can't raise this the only thing you can
 
06:56:04.948 --> 06:56:04.958 align:start position:0%
do is appeal it but it makes a huge
 
06:56:07.110 --> 06:56:07.120 align:start position:0%
difference in your trial and i hope i've
 
06:56:10.868 --> 06:56:10.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:56:12.708 --> 06:56:12.718 align:start position:0%
yes thank you um
 
06:56:14.310 --> 06:56:14.320 align:start position:0%
representative you have a follow-up
 
06:56:16.788 --> 06:56:16.798 align:start position:0%
question i do thank you
 
06:56:16.798 --> 06:56:17.590 align:start position:0%
question i do thank you
so

06:56:17.590 --> 06:56:17.600 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:56:19.190 --> 06:56:19.200 align:start position:0%
based on any assumption if i'm walking
 
06:56:21.750 --> 06:56:21.760 align:start position:0%
down the street and i'm assuming right i
 
06:56:24.548 --> 06:56:24.558 align:start position:0%
i believe they're likely to commit an
 
06:56:26.310 --> 06:56:26.320 align:start position:0%
act of violence
 
06:56:27.430 --> 06:56:27.440 align:start position:0%
and i
 
06:56:29.270 --> 06:56:29.280 align:start position:0%
do something and i kill them and i shoot
 
06:56:29.280 --> 06:56:30.070 align:start position:0%
do something and i kill them and i shoot
them

06:56:30.070 --> 06:56:30.080 align:start position:0%
them
 
06:56:34.230 --> 06:56:34.240 align:start position:0%
there's nobody else but me right to
 
06:56:35.670 --> 06:56:35.680 align:start position:0%
the state what happened because the
 
06:56:37.430 --> 06:56:37.440 align:start position:0%
other person's dead
 
06:56:37.440 --> 06:56:38.468 align:start position:0%
other person's dead
so

06:56:38.468 --> 06:56:38.478 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:56:41.350 --> 06:56:41.360 align:start position:0%
based on that assumption
 
06:56:42.708 --> 06:56:42.718 align:start position:0%
i have now killed somebody and there's
 
06:56:44.390 --> 06:56:44.400 align:start position:0%
nobody else to prove what happened
 
06:56:46.708 --> 06:56:46.718 align:start position:0%
except for me
 
06:56:48.628 --> 06:56:48.638 align:start position:0%
is there something do you feel that's
 
06:56:50.708 --> 06:56:50.718 align:start position:0%
off is there something
 
06:56:51.990 --> 06:56:52.000 align:start position:0%
that's no
 
06:56:52.000 --> 06:56:52.788 align:start position:0%
that's no
that's

06:56:52.788 --> 06:56:52.798 align:start position:0%
that's
 
06:56:54.468 --> 06:56:54.478 align:start position:0%
ma'am that's no different or
 
06:56:57.190 --> 06:56:57.200 align:start position:0%
representative that's no different
 
06:56:59.590 --> 06:56:59.600 align:start position:0%
than any other thing if if i if a
 
06:57:01.430 --> 06:57:01.440 align:start position:0%
person's driving their car down the
 
06:57:03.350 --> 06:57:03.360 align:start position:0%
street and they run you over run a
 
06:57:05.030 --> 06:57:05.040 align:start position:0%
person over
 
06:57:07.510 --> 06:57:07.520 align:start position:0%
and they say that you walked out in the
 
06:57:09.590 --> 06:57:09.600 align:start position:0%
road in front of them or that all sorts
 
06:57:10.788 --> 06:57:10.798 align:start position:0%
of things there's only one person
 
06:57:12.230 --> 06:57:12.240 align:start position:0%
telling the story there's a guy in the
 
06:57:12.240 --> 06:57:13.350 align:start position:0%
telling the story there's a guy in the
car

06:57:13.350 --> 06:57:13.360 align:start position:0%
car
 
06:57:15.750 --> 06:57:15.760 align:start position:0%
so there's a million other ways that
 
06:57:17.910 --> 06:57:17.920 align:start position:0%
there's only going to be one voice being
 
06:57:17.920 --> 06:57:18.788 align:start position:0%
there's only going to be one voice being
heard

06:57:18.788 --> 06:57:18.798 align:start position:0%
heard
 
06:57:21.110 --> 06:57:21.120 align:start position:0%
and so i don't think it's off with all
 
06:57:22.868 --> 06:57:22.878 align:start position:0%
due respect because
 
06:57:24.788 --> 06:57:24.798 align:start position:0%
i have to tell you the majority of gun
 
06:57:24.798 --> 06:57:25.910 align:start position:0%
i have to tell you the majority of gun
owners

06:57:25.910 --> 06:57:25.920 align:start position:0%
owners
 
06:57:27.830 --> 06:57:27.840 align:start position:0%
do not want to be forced to have to
 
06:57:29.350 --> 06:57:29.360 align:start position:0%
defend themselves that's the most
 
06:57:32.390 --> 06:57:32.400 align:start position:0%
horrible horrible thing afterwards
 
06:57:34.230 --> 06:57:34.240 align:start position:0%
you have what's called the mark of cane
 
06:57:35.990 --> 06:57:36.000 align:start position:0%
people look at you like oh you've killed
 
06:57:36.000 --> 06:57:37.430 align:start position:0%
people look at you like oh you've killed
someone

06:57:37.430 --> 06:57:37.440 align:start position:0%
someone
 
06:57:39.510 --> 06:57:39.520 align:start position:0%
it's a horrible horrible thing it's a
 
06:57:41.030 --> 06:57:41.040 align:start position:0%
horrible burden
 
06:57:43.510 --> 06:57:43.520 align:start position:0%
to have to defend yourself like that
 
06:57:45.590 --> 06:57:45.600 align:start position:0%
people that have to defend themselves a
 
06:57:47.590 --> 06:57:47.600 align:start position:0%
lot of times have nightmares
 
06:57:49.990 --> 06:57:50.000 align:start position:0%
they have sleep disturbance
 
06:57:51.910 --> 06:57:51.920 align:start position:0%
there are all sorts of physiological and
 
06:57:54.390 --> 06:57:54.400 align:start position:0%
psychological things going on that go
 
06:57:57.030 --> 06:57:57.040 align:start position:0%
along with having to defend yourself
 
06:57:59.830 --> 06:57:59.840 align:start position:0%
but you have to ask yourself
 
06:58:01.990 --> 06:58:02.000 align:start position:0%
it's no different than if someone pushes
 
06:58:03.670 --> 06:58:03.680 align:start position:0%
someone off a cliff or there's just a
 
06:58:05.990 --> 06:58:06.000 align:start position:0%
million ways if a person is inclined to
 
06:58:08.230 --> 06:58:08.240 align:start position:0%
kill people that they can do it so to
 
06:58:10.468 --> 06:58:10.478 align:start position:0%
say that they're going to use this i
 
06:58:13.270 --> 06:58:13.280 align:start position:0%
respectfully would say they don't and
 
06:58:15.190 --> 06:58:15.200 align:start position:0%
and i just don't think that's a
 
06:58:17.350 --> 06:58:17.360 align:start position:0%
um fear can i say that no one's ever
 
06:58:19.430 --> 06:58:19.440 align:start position:0%
going to do this i can't say that ma'am
 
06:58:21.190 --> 06:58:21.200 align:start position:0%
you know i mean a representative i can't
 
06:58:22.548 --> 06:58:22.558 align:start position:0%
make that statement i don't think
 
06:58:25.430 --> 06:58:25.440 align:start position:0%
anybody can um
 
06:58:28.310 --> 06:58:28.320 align:start position:0%
if i take medication could i give too
 
06:58:30.150 --> 06:58:30.160 align:start position:0%
much to someone i wanted to get rid of
 
06:58:31.590 --> 06:58:31.600 align:start position:0%
if i didn't think it'd show up in their
 
06:58:33.750 --> 06:58:33.760 align:start position:0%
system yeah there's a million things but
 
06:58:35.430 --> 06:58:35.440 align:start position:0%
i don't think
 
06:58:37.590 --> 06:58:37.600 align:start position:0%
that you're going to have that happening
 
06:58:39.990 --> 06:58:40.000 align:start position:0%
here and especially in new hampshire we
 
06:58:42.230 --> 06:58:42.240 align:start position:0%
have people who defend themselves get
 
06:58:45.270 --> 06:58:45.280 align:start position:0%
charged all the time sadly people that
 
06:58:47.990 --> 06:58:48.000 align:start position:0%
should not be charged because again the
 
06:58:50.788 --> 06:58:50.798 align:start position:0%
county attorney has or in the case of a
 
06:58:52.788 --> 06:58:52.798 align:start position:0%
homicide the attorney general has
 
06:58:55.110 --> 06:58:55.120 align:start position:0%
exclusive and discretionary law making
 
06:58:56.868 --> 06:58:56.878 align:start position:0%
authority as to whether or not to charge
 
06:58:59.910 --> 06:58:59.920 align:start position:0%
someone so they can still charge you
 
06:59:01.030 --> 06:59:01.040 align:start position:0%
because again remember this is an
 
06:59:03.190 --> 06:59:03.200 align:start position:0%
affirmative defense that a judge has to
 
06:59:08.708 --> 06:59:08.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:59:10.708 --> 06:59:10.718 align:start position:0%
and so i i hope that answers your
 
06:59:12.628 --> 06:59:12.638 align:start position:0%
question i can i don't think with any of
 
06:59:14.708 --> 06:59:14.718 align:start position:0%
this that i can make any
 
06:59:17.430 --> 06:59:17.440 align:start position:0%
promises or assurances no one can
 
06:59:19.110 --> 06:59:19.120 align:start position:0%
but i can tell you that usually law
 
06:59:21.910 --> 06:59:21.920 align:start position:0%
enforcement does pretty darn thorough
 
06:59:21.920 --> 06:59:23.430 align:start position:0%
enforcement does pretty darn thorough
um

06:59:23.430 --> 06:59:23.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:59:26.230 --> 06:59:26.240 align:start position:0%
research and investigation
 
06:59:28.948 --> 06:59:28.958 align:start position:0%
in cases like this or one would hope
 
06:59:31.750 --> 06:59:31.760 align:start position:0%
and if there's any evidence they tend to
 
06:59:36.948 --> 06:59:36.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:59:38.390 --> 06:59:38.400 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure if i put your i might have
 
06:59:45.670 --> 06:59:45.680 align:start position:0%
 
07:00:01.750 --> 07:00:01.760 align:start position:0%
 
07:00:03.030 --> 07:00:03.040 align:start position:0%
you may ask are you recognized for a
 
07:00:05.590 --> 07:00:05.600 align:start position:0%
question thank you mr chairman i hope
 
07:00:07.670 --> 07:00:07.680 align:start position:0%
you can hear me um
 
07:00:10.150 --> 07:00:10.160 align:start position:0%
we've seen it for the past year and uh
 
07:00:12.390 --> 07:00:12.400 align:start position:0%
briefly it's january a voice for
 
07:00:12.400 --> 07:00:13.670 align:start position:0%
briefly it's january a voice for
disagreement

07:00:13.670 --> 07:00:13.680 align:start position:0%
disagreement
 
07:00:15.750 --> 07:00:15.760 align:start position:0%
over the
 
07:00:15.760 --> 07:00:21.370 align:start position:0%
over the
our

07:00:21.370 --> 07:00:21.380 align:start position:0%
 
07:00:21.380 --> 07:00:28.708 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

07:00:28.708 --> 07:00:28.718 align:start position:0%
 
07:00:30.390 --> 07:00:30.400 align:start position:0%
i'm very sorry
 
07:00:32.788 --> 07:00:32.798 align:start position:0%
i thought i heard can people identify a
 
07:00:34.788 --> 07:00:34.798 align:start position:0%
riot for some reason i'm having trouble
 
07:00:37.350 --> 07:00:37.360 align:start position:0%
hearing you and i apologize it may be my
 
07:00:40.628 --> 07:00:40.638 align:start position:0%
equipment but i think i said i think you
 
07:00:42.868 --> 07:00:42.878 align:start position:0%
asked me representative
 
07:00:44.868 --> 07:00:44.878 align:start position:0%
could people identify a riot could you
 
07:00:46.948 --> 07:00:46.958 align:start position:0%
possibly maybe repeat part of the
 
07:00:48.628 --> 07:00:48.638 align:start position:0%
question so i can hear it
 
07:00:49.990 --> 07:00:50.000 align:start position:0%
i think
 
07:00:51.750 --> 07:00:51.760 align:start position:0%
representative please correct any part
 
07:00:52.868 --> 07:00:52.878 align:start position:0%
of me asking the question that's
 
07:00:54.468 --> 07:00:54.478 align:start position:0%
incorrectly i'm asking this on behalf of
 
07:00:56.830 --> 07:00:56.840 align:start position:0%
representative holden are you asking the
 
07:00:59.430 --> 07:00:59.440 align:start position:0%
witness that do you think an ordinary
 
07:01:01.350 --> 07:01:01.360 align:start position:0%
individual would understand the
 
07:01:02.948 --> 07:01:02.958 align:start position:0%
difference between a peaceful protest
 
07:01:04.468 --> 07:01:04.478 align:start position:0%
and a right and i think the legal
 
07:01:06.708 --> 07:01:06.718 align:start position:0%
definition of a rise is that the
 
07:01:06.718 --> 07:01:08.548 align:start position:0%
definition of a rise is that the
question

07:01:08.548 --> 07:01:08.558 align:start position:0%
question
 
07:01:09.590 --> 07:01:09.600 align:start position:0%
that's the question that uh
 
07:01:12.708 --> 07:01:12.718 align:start position:0%
 
07:01:16.230 --> 07:01:16.240 align:start position:0%
yes representative i think they can um
 
07:01:18.628 --> 07:01:18.638 align:start position:0%
because the riot definition
 
07:01:21.430 --> 07:01:21.440 align:start position:0%
is based on what's called common sense
 
07:01:25.430 --> 07:01:25.440 align:start position:0%
and it's a part of it which is 644 colon
 
07:01:27.910 --> 07:01:27.920 align:start position:0%
one roman one
 
07:01:29.110 --> 07:01:29.120 align:start position:0%
sub a
 
07:01:31.390 --> 07:01:31.400 align:start position:0%
is the person that's guilty of riot if
 
07:01:33.670 --> 07:01:33.680 align:start position:0%
simultaneously with two or more other
 
07:01:36.390 --> 07:01:36.400 align:start position:0%
person he engages in tumultuous or
 
07:01:39.270 --> 07:01:39.280 align:start position:0%
violent conduct and thereby purposely or
 
07:01:42.070 --> 07:01:42.080 align:start position:0%
recklessly creates a substantial risk of
 
07:01:45.030 --> 07:01:45.040 align:start position:0%
causing public alarm
 
07:01:47.990 --> 07:01:48.000 align:start position:0%
and it goes on and on but basically
 
07:01:50.070 --> 07:01:50.080 align:start position:0%
i think an average intelligent person
 
07:01:51.510 --> 07:01:51.520 align:start position:0%
can tell the difference between
 
07:01:55.110 --> 07:01:55.120 align:start position:0%
horseplay and violent attack towards you
 
07:01:57.670 --> 07:01:57.680 align:start position:0%
or behavior that is going to become
 
07:02:00.868 --> 07:02:00.878 align:start position:0%
violent towards you so a couple of young
 
07:02:03.750 --> 07:02:03.760 align:start position:0%
men or young people having horseplay and
 
07:02:07.190 --> 07:02:07.200 align:start position:0%
wrestling is not going to come up to the
 
07:02:10.070 --> 07:02:10.080 align:start position:0%
level of riot but people that are making
 
07:02:13.750 --> 07:02:13.760 align:start position:0%
threatening gestures or statements or
 
07:02:16.468 --> 07:02:16.478 align:start position:0%
making physical movements towards you or
 
07:02:20.628 --> 07:02:20.638 align:start position:0%
displaying a weapon or making threats
 
07:02:23.430 --> 07:02:23.440 align:start position:0%
for example men zipping unzipping their
 
07:02:25.270 --> 07:02:25.280 align:start position:0%
pants and saying we're going to have a
 
07:02:26.628 --> 07:02:26.638 align:start position:0%
good time
 
07:02:28.548 --> 07:02:28.558 align:start position:0%
i think
 
07:02:31.750 --> 07:02:31.760 align:start position:0%
that's going to be the type of behavior
 
07:02:33.910 --> 07:02:33.920 align:start position:0%
that factual scenario and this is no
 
07:02:36.070 --> 07:02:36.080 align:start position:0%
different than when police officers say
 
07:02:37.830 --> 07:02:37.840 align:start position:0%
they arrest someone for certain behavior
 
07:02:40.310 --> 07:02:40.320 align:start position:0%
they have to enunciate facts
 
07:02:42.548 --> 07:02:42.558 align:start position:0%
that rise to the level of the alleged
 
07:02:45.430 --> 07:02:45.440 align:start position:0%
crime and so in this particular case
 
07:02:47.670 --> 07:02:47.680 align:start position:0%
even though the average person may not
 
07:02:49.590 --> 07:02:49.600 align:start position:0%
be able to quote the elements of the
 
07:02:49.600 --> 07:02:50.948 align:start position:0%
be able to quote the elements of the
statute

07:02:50.948 --> 07:02:50.958 align:start position:0%
statute
 
07:02:53.110 --> 07:02:53.120 align:start position:0%
here's what i think they will be able to
 
07:02:55.270 --> 07:02:55.280 align:start position:0%
do they will be able to identify a
 
07:02:55.280 --> 07:02:56.150 align:start position:0%
do they will be able to identify a
threat

07:02:56.150 --> 07:02:56.160 align:start position:0%
threat
 
07:02:57.670 --> 07:02:57.680 align:start position:0%
every i think everyone knows the
 
07:02:59.110 --> 07:02:59.120 align:start position:0%
difference again between the kid in the
 
07:03:00.948 --> 07:03:00.958 align:start position:0%
balloon or a 12 year old saying i'm
 
07:03:03.030 --> 07:03:03.040 align:start position:0%
gonna punch you in the nose
 
07:03:04.628 --> 07:03:04.638 align:start position:0%
and a larger
 
07:03:06.948 --> 07:03:06.958 align:start position:0%
um and stronger person or a group of
 
07:03:09.590 --> 07:03:09.600 align:start position:0%
people coming towards you and making
 
07:03:12.548 --> 07:03:12.558 align:start position:0%
threatening gestures or saying things of
 
07:03:14.230 --> 07:03:14.240 align:start position:0%
a threatening nature
 
07:03:17.030 --> 07:03:17.040 align:start position:0%
and i think that's going to make a huge
 
07:03:17.040 --> 07:03:19.110 align:start position:0%
and i think that's going to make a huge
difference

07:03:19.110 --> 07:03:19.120 align:start position:0%
difference
 
07:03:21.270 --> 07:03:21.280 align:start position:0%
in how this is interpreted so no i don't
 
07:03:23.510 --> 07:03:23.520 align:start position:0%
see a problem this statute has been on
 
07:03:25.670 --> 07:03:25.680 align:start position:0%
the books the riot statute for quite
 
07:03:27.110 --> 07:03:27.120 align:start position:0%
some years
 
07:03:29.430 --> 07:03:29.440 align:start position:0%
and i have not heard of there being a
 
07:03:32.628 --> 07:03:32.638 align:start position:0%
huge problem with defining it
 
07:03:35.990 --> 07:03:36.000 align:start position:0%
it was enacted first in 1971 it's been
 
07:03:39.350 --> 07:03:39.360 align:start position:0%
amended in 1990 2004
 
07:03:41.750 --> 07:03:41.760 align:start position:0%
and in 2005.
 
07:03:44.070 --> 07:03:44.080 align:start position:0%
and this legislature legislatures in new
 
07:03:46.390 --> 07:03:46.400 align:start position:0%
hampshire are typically very
 
07:03:49.270 --> 07:03:49.280 align:start position:0%
fairly proactive and no one's attempted
 
07:03:50.628 --> 07:03:50.638 align:start position:0%
that i'm aware
 
07:03:53.670 --> 07:03:53.680 align:start position:0%
to amend it since 2005 or if there is it
 
07:03:55.590 --> 07:03:55.600 align:start position:0%
never caught my eye and i don't believe
 
07:03:57.110 --> 07:03:57.120 align:start position:0%
there's any bills before the general
 
07:03:59.350 --> 07:03:59.360 align:start position:0%
court right now so
 
07:04:00.948 --> 07:04:00.958 align:start position:0%
my thought is that the general court
 
07:04:05.350 --> 07:04:05.360 align:start position:0%
 
07:04:07.990 --> 07:04:08.000 align:start position:0%
i'm asking may ask a question and this
 
07:04:10.628 --> 07:04:10.638 align:start position:0%
this is perhaps a concern that may
 
07:04:14.310 --> 07:04:14.320 align:start position:0%
pre-exist this particular film
 
07:04:16.150 --> 07:04:16.160 align:start position:0%
how does when it comes to writing how
 
07:04:17.910 --> 07:04:17.920 align:start position:0%
exactly in the world do we distinguish
 
07:04:17.920 --> 07:04:18.868 align:start position:0%
exactly in the world do we distinguish
between

07:04:18.868 --> 07:04:18.878 align:start position:0%
between
 
07:04:21.590 --> 07:04:21.600 align:start position:0%
100 people who are peacefully protesting
 
07:04:21.600 --> 07:04:22.468 align:start position:0%
100 people who are peacefully protesting
then

07:04:22.468 --> 07:04:22.478 align:start position:0%
then
 
07:04:24.548 --> 07:04:24.558 align:start position:0%
five of those people deviate from the
 
07:04:26.548 --> 07:04:26.558 align:start position:0%
peaceful protest into what is now a
 
07:04:28.628 --> 07:04:28.638 align:start position:0%
violent protest so really you have five
 
07:04:29.910 --> 07:04:29.920 align:start position:0%
bad actors
 
07:04:32.310 --> 07:04:32.320 align:start position:0%
mixed in with 95 good actors
 
07:04:33.750 --> 07:04:33.760 align:start position:0%
and i'm just wondering for the sake of
 
07:04:36.628 --> 07:04:36.638 align:start position:0%
that scenario how exactly does the law
 
07:04:38.548 --> 07:04:38.558 align:start position:0%
separate that because i i understand in
 
07:04:41.270 --> 07:04:41.280 align:start position:0%
maybe the public opinion
 
07:04:42.788 --> 07:04:42.798 align:start position:0%
all hundred are gonna be considered bad
 
07:04:44.868 --> 07:04:44.878 align:start position:0%
but from the legal sense
 
07:04:46.868 --> 07:04:46.878 align:start position:0%
it seems that they're kind of all lumped
 
07:04:49.110 --> 07:04:49.120 align:start position:0%
together but how do you i'm wondering on
 
07:04:50.948 --> 07:04:50.958 align:start position:0%
the other 95 in the face charge
 
07:04:50.958 --> 07:04:52.468 align:start position:0%
the other 95 in the face charge
detention

07:04:52.468 --> 07:04:52.478 align:start position:0%
detention
 
07:04:55.510 --> 07:04:55.520 align:start position:0%
i don't think they're going to um not
 
07:04:57.350 --> 07:04:57.360 align:start position:0%
successful charges and here's why
 
07:04:59.030 --> 07:04:59.040 align:start position:0%
they're going to look at the behavior of
 
07:05:02.150 --> 07:05:02.160 align:start position:0%
individuals nowadays businesses have
 
07:05:02.160 --> 07:05:04.390 align:start position:0%
individuals nowadays businesses have
cameras

07:05:04.390 --> 07:05:04.400 align:start position:0%
cameras
 
07:05:06.310 --> 07:05:06.320 align:start position:0%
there's rarely an event that there isn't
 
07:05:07.670 --> 07:05:07.680 align:start position:0%
everyone with their cell phone out
 
07:05:10.468 --> 07:05:10.478 align:start position:0%
taking video of it or taking snapshots
 
07:05:12.310 --> 07:05:12.320 align:start position:0%
of it and so you're going to look at the
 
07:05:14.150 --> 07:05:14.160 align:start position:0%
behavior of each person the person who's
 
07:05:16.548 --> 07:05:16.558 align:start position:0%
standing there yelling rah-rah for this
 
07:05:19.190 --> 07:05:19.200 align:start position:0%
or no no for that and holding a sign and
 
07:05:20.788 --> 07:05:20.798 align:start position:0%
and kind of lifting it up and down and
 
07:05:22.628 --> 07:05:22.638 align:start position:0%
yelling that person is no threat to
 
07:05:24.788 --> 07:05:24.798 align:start position:0%
anyone um the most
 
07:05:26.150 --> 07:05:26.160 align:start position:0%
you know is if someone doesn't like them
 
07:05:28.070 --> 07:05:28.080 align:start position:0%
yelling around well tough luck you know
 
07:05:29.670 --> 07:05:29.680 align:start position:0%
what i'm saying they're just peacefully
 
07:05:31.750 --> 07:05:31.760 align:start position:0%
protesting what they're gonna look at is
 
07:05:33.510 --> 07:05:33.520 align:start position:0%
the person who's maybe
 
07:05:36.310 --> 07:05:36.320 align:start position:0%
smashing furniture or smashing things
 
07:05:38.548 --> 07:05:38.558 align:start position:0%
and picking them up in their hand and
 
07:05:40.390 --> 07:05:40.400 align:start position:0%
coming towards you
 
07:05:41.990 --> 07:05:42.000 align:start position:0%
and making threatening
 
07:05:43.990 --> 07:05:44.000 align:start position:0%
movements but the person who's just
 
07:05:46.628 --> 07:05:46.638 align:start position:0%
marching along and yelling and holding a
 
07:05:49.430 --> 07:05:49.440 align:start position:0%
sign or maybe waving a banner
 
07:05:52.310 --> 07:05:52.320 align:start position:0%
those people are not going to be if you
 
07:05:55.190 --> 07:05:55.200 align:start position:0%
will piled in with the bad actors
 
07:05:57.750 --> 07:05:57.760 align:start position:0%
because you if you use this are going to
 
07:06:00.310 --> 07:06:00.320 align:start position:0%
have to again describe in order to be
 
07:06:02.070 --> 07:06:02.080 align:start position:0%
allowed by a judge
 
07:06:03.830 --> 07:06:03.840 align:start position:0%
to raise this affirmative defense when
 
07:06:05.350 --> 07:06:05.360 align:start position:0%
you've been charged you're going to have
 
07:06:08.150 --> 07:06:08.160 align:start position:0%
to describe to a judge specifically what
 
07:06:09.910 --> 07:06:09.920 align:start position:0%
that person was doing to be a threat to
 
07:06:11.990 --> 07:06:12.000 align:start position:0%
you and in your scenario you got a
 
07:06:14.948 --> 07:06:14.958 align:start position:0%
hundred other witnesses
 
07:06:18.788 --> 07:06:18.798 align:start position:0%
you know and and if if a person to
 
07:06:20.708 --> 07:06:20.718 align:start position:0%
address the former representative they
 
07:06:22.230 --> 07:06:22.240 align:start position:0%
asked me a question i apologize i've
 
07:06:23.750 --> 07:06:23.760 align:start position:0%
forgotten her name
 
07:06:25.430 --> 07:06:25.440 align:start position:0%
you're gonna have witnesses if that
 
07:06:27.590 --> 07:06:27.600 align:start position:0%
person tries to lie and say this person
 
07:06:28.708 --> 07:06:28.718 align:start position:0%
did this you're gonna have a hundred
 
07:06:31.110 --> 07:06:31.120 align:start position:0%
witnesses that say no we saw him or her
 
07:06:33.830 --> 07:06:33.840 align:start position:0%
do or not do x y
 
07:06:33.840 --> 07:06:35.030 align:start position:0%
do or not do x y
representative

07:06:35.030 --> 07:06:35.040 align:start position:0%
representative
 
07:06:37.350 --> 07:06:37.360 align:start position:0%
you have an additional question
 
07:06:39.110 --> 07:06:39.120 align:start position:0%
thank you mr pierre
 
07:06:40.868 --> 07:06:40.878 align:start position:0%
i hope that
 
07:06:42.708 --> 07:06:42.718 align:start position:0%
you can hear me
 
07:06:44.230 --> 07:06:44.240 align:start position:0%
i'll read i'll make sure to repeat it
 
07:06:46.948 --> 07:06:46.958 align:start position:0%
 
07:06:46.958 --> 07:06:48.310 align:start position:0%
 
the yes

07:06:48.310 --> 07:06:48.320 align:start position:0%
 
07:06:52.468 --> 07:06:52.478 align:start position:0%
between running gestures and vehicles
 
07:06:54.788 --> 07:06:54.798 align:start position:0%
and i'm reminded of road rage and in
 
07:06:56.548 --> 07:06:56.558 align:start position:0%
particular the incident a couple of
 
07:06:59.190 --> 07:06:59.200 align:start position:0%
years ago in the north country where
 
07:07:01.430 --> 07:07:01.440 align:start position:0%
someone was having a road rage thing
 
07:07:03.910 --> 07:07:03.920 align:start position:0%
with another person on the road and then
 
07:07:06.230 --> 07:07:06.240 align:start position:0%
they got out of their car and
 
07:07:08.150 --> 07:07:08.160 align:start position:0%
shot the other person and they're
 
07:07:08.160 --> 07:07:09.190 align:start position:0%
shot the other person and they're
claiming

07:07:09.190 --> 07:07:09.200 align:start position:0%
claiming
 
07:07:11.350 --> 07:07:11.360 align:start position:0%
self-defense but they're in prison
 
07:07:13.350 --> 07:07:13.360 align:start position:0%
certainly i believe
 
07:07:15.830 --> 07:07:15.840 align:start position:0%
um so i was wondering if passing this
 
07:07:18.150 --> 07:07:18.160 align:start position:0%
would give someone the impression
 
07:07:19.910 --> 07:07:19.920 align:start position:0%
that um
 
07:07:21.750 --> 07:07:21.760 align:start position:0%
a gun would be an acceptable way to
 
07:07:25.990 --> 07:07:26.000 align:start position:0%
 
07:07:28.150 --> 07:07:28.160 align:start position:0%
i can answer that question and there's
 
07:07:30.868 --> 07:07:30.878 align:start position:0%
kind of a very famous or infamous case
 
07:07:33.670 --> 07:07:33.680 align:start position:0%
on road rage in and it happened at the
 
07:07:36.708 --> 07:07:36.718 align:start position:0%
nashua mall and ironically because
 
07:07:38.948 --> 07:07:38.958 align:start position:0%
the elements ended up happening over the
 
07:07:40.628 --> 07:07:40.638 align:start position:0%
line a lot of people don't know that one
 
07:07:42.230 --> 07:07:42.240 align:start position:0%
end of the nashua mall is actually
 
07:07:44.628 --> 07:07:44.638 align:start position:0%
located in kingsborough mass
 
07:07:46.468 --> 07:07:46.478 align:start position:0%
so the case even though it started in
 
07:07:47.990 --> 07:07:48.000 align:start position:0%
national new hampshire ended up being
 
07:07:50.628 --> 07:07:50.638 align:start position:0%
tried in kingsborough mass and it's um
 
07:07:53.030 --> 07:07:53.040 align:start position:0%
commonwealth for david bushong and i
 
07:07:55.030 --> 07:07:55.040 align:start position:0%
tried that case
 
07:07:57.910 --> 07:07:57.920 align:start position:0%
and the answer is in that case david
 
07:08:01.190 --> 07:08:01.200 align:start position:0%
bouchong did not have a gun on him
 
07:08:04.070 --> 07:08:04.080 align:start position:0%
and he was accused of having a gun what
 
07:08:05.670 --> 07:08:05.680 align:start position:0%
he had was a cell phone in his hand a
 
07:08:07.350 --> 07:08:07.360 align:start position:0%
black cell phone in his hand and a shiny
 
07:08:08.788 --> 07:08:08.798 align:start position:0%
silver watch
 
07:08:10.948 --> 07:08:10.958 align:start position:0%
and it was conclusively proven at trial
 
07:08:13.110 --> 07:08:13.120 align:start position:0%
he was accused but
 
07:08:15.990 --> 07:08:16.000 align:start position:0%
a automobile depending on the automobile
 
07:08:18.628 --> 07:08:18.638 align:start position:0%
is a three to five or six thousand pound
 
07:08:21.270 --> 07:08:21.280 align:start position:0%
deadly weapon it's more it's as deadly
 
07:08:23.750 --> 07:08:23.760 align:start position:0%
as a firearm and if a person rams you
 
07:08:26.548 --> 07:08:26.558 align:start position:0%
with that automobile or tries to run you
 
07:08:28.468 --> 07:08:28.478 align:start position:0%
off the road with that automobile a
 
07:08:30.548 --> 07:08:30.558 align:start position:0%
firearm may be your only choice to
 
07:08:32.468 --> 07:08:32.478 align:start position:0%
defend yourself if you happen to have
 
07:08:34.390 --> 07:08:34.400 align:start position:0%
like dave bushong had he had a very
 
07:08:35.830 --> 07:08:35.840 align:start position:0%
small car
 
07:08:37.990 --> 07:08:38.000 align:start position:0%
and the vehicle it was a toyota i can't
 
07:08:40.070 --> 07:08:40.080 align:start position:0%
remember what model and the vehicle was
 
07:08:42.390 --> 07:08:42.400 align:start position:0%
a giant four-wheel drive
 
07:08:45.030 --> 07:08:45.040 align:start position:0%
huge it was either 250 or 350
 
07:08:46.628 --> 07:08:46.638 align:start position:0%
three-quarter tonight three-quarter
 
07:08:48.390 --> 07:08:48.400 align:start position:0%
maybe even a one-ton truck
 
07:08:50.868 --> 07:08:50.878 align:start position:0%
that was trying to ram him
 
07:08:53.430 --> 07:08:53.440 align:start position:0%
so a firearm sometimes you have to use
 
07:08:55.990 --> 07:08:56.000 align:start position:0%
whatever self-defense tool is at hand
 
07:08:57.750 --> 07:08:57.760 align:start position:0%
and in the case of a small toyota it
 
07:08:59.430 --> 07:08:59.440 align:start position:0%
didn't have the horsepower to outrun
 
07:09:01.510 --> 07:09:01.520 align:start position:0%
this large truck
 
07:09:02.948 --> 07:09:02.958 align:start position:0%
and so
 
07:09:05.030 --> 07:09:05.040 align:start position:0%
i think when you talk about using a
 
07:09:06.628 --> 07:09:06.638 align:start position:0%
firearm people
 
07:09:09.110 --> 07:09:09.120 align:start position:0%
generally use that as a last resort or
 
07:09:11.270 --> 07:09:11.280 align:start position:0%
to warn off danger
 
07:09:13.910 --> 07:09:13.920 align:start position:0%
and so i think if you are facing a five
 
07:09:15.750 --> 07:09:15.760 align:start position:0%
thousand pound or three thousand pound
 
07:09:18.468 --> 07:09:18.478 align:start position:0%
missile coming at you at 30 40 50 60 or
 
07:09:20.548 --> 07:09:20.558 align:start position:0%
80 miles an hour on the highway that a
 
07:09:21.910 --> 07:09:21.920 align:start position:0%
firearm may be an appropriate
 
07:09:25.270 --> 07:09:25.280 align:start position:0%
self-defense tool and i can't think of a
 
07:09:26.868 --> 07:09:26.878 align:start position:0%
better self-defense tool because you're
 
07:09:29.190 --> 07:09:29.200 align:start position:0%
not going to have a police officer right
 
07:09:31.670 --> 07:09:31.680 align:start position:0%
behind you on the road at all times
 
07:09:34.230 --> 07:09:34.240 align:start position:0%
and sometimes people have tried
 
07:09:36.230 --> 07:09:36.240 align:start position:0%
um in the dave bushong case it was
 
07:09:38.390 --> 07:09:38.400 align:start position:0%
father's day and he determined not only
 
07:09:40.468 --> 07:09:40.478 align:start position:0%
was he not able to outrun this truck but
 
07:09:42.628 --> 07:09:42.638 align:start position:0%
if he tried to get in a lane to get back
 
07:09:44.230 --> 07:09:44.240 align:start position:0%
out on the highway just to get away from
 
07:09:45.990 --> 07:09:46.000 align:start position:0%
this man there was a
 
07:09:47.430 --> 07:09:47.440 align:start position:0%
huge line of cars he couldn't get
 
07:09:48.628 --> 07:09:48.638 align:start position:0%
through him he would have been rammed
 
07:09:50.788 --> 07:09:50.798 align:start position:0%
from the rear so
 
07:09:52.708 --> 07:09:52.718 align:start position:0%
you know i respectfully invite people to
 
07:09:54.468 --> 07:09:54.478 align:start position:0%
look at that case if anyone wants to
 
07:09:56.310 --> 07:09:56.320 align:start position:0%
email me i'll email you some articles
 
07:09:58.070 --> 07:09:58.080 align:start position:0%
i've written on the case
 
07:09:59.910 --> 07:09:59.920 align:start position:0%
but the answer is
 
07:10:01.990 --> 07:10:02.000 align:start position:0%
more and more people for whatever reason
 
07:10:04.548 --> 07:10:04.558 align:start position:0%
are engaging in road rage and it's
 
07:10:06.708 --> 07:10:06.718 align:start position:0%
unfortunate but it's a fact and they've
 
07:10:08.628 --> 07:10:08.638 align:start position:0%
determined that these vehicles are again
 
07:10:10.310 --> 07:10:10.320 align:start position:0%
missiles that you can ram people off the
 
07:10:12.310 --> 07:10:12.320 align:start position:0%
road run into people
 
07:10:15.590 --> 07:10:15.600 align:start position:0%
and having a firearm to warn away
 
07:10:17.590 --> 07:10:17.600 align:start position:0%
that type of situation is sometimes
 
07:10:20.230 --> 07:10:20.240 align:start position:0%
perfectly appropriate so i see it being
 
07:10:22.548 --> 07:10:22.558 align:start position:0%
allowed to be used in this instance and
 
07:10:24.548 --> 07:10:24.558 align:start position:0%
it should a person shouldn't be charged
 
07:10:26.468 --> 07:10:26.478 align:start position:0%
when all they're trying to do
 
07:10:28.468 --> 07:10:28.478 align:start position:0%
is warn away an aggressor who's
 
07:10:37.750 --> 07:10:37.760 align:start position:0%
 
07:10:39.670 --> 07:10:39.680 align:start position:0%
or in the case of a motorcycle i should
 
07:10:39.680 --> 07:10:40.948 align:start position:0%
or in the case of a motorcycle i should
add

07:10:40.948 --> 07:10:40.958 align:start position:0%
add
 
07:10:42.708 --> 07:10:42.718 align:start position:0%
i should add that i rode a motorcycle
 
07:10:44.468 --> 07:10:44.478 align:start position:0%
most of my life and i've had vehicles
 
07:10:45.750 --> 07:10:45.760 align:start position:0%
try and run me off the road on my
 
07:10:45.760 --> 07:10:50.788 align:start position:0%
try and run me off the road on my
motorcycle

07:10:50.788 --> 07:10:50.798 align:start position:0%
 
07:10:52.390 --> 07:10:52.400 align:start position:0%
i want to
 
07:10:54.468 --> 07:10:54.478 align:start position:0%
i see no no additional hands raised i
 
07:10:55.670 --> 07:10:55.680 align:start position:0%

demand action and resident of nashua i
 
07:12:09.590 --> 07:12:09.600 align:start position:0%
am testifying in opposition to house
 
07:12:11.190 --> 07:12:11.200 align:start position:0%
bill 197
 
07:12:12.788 --> 07:12:12.798 align:start position:0%
new hampshire's effort to expand our
 
07:12:14.390 --> 07:12:14.400 align:start position:0%
already dangerous stand your ground law
 
07:12:17.510 --> 07:12:17.520 align:start position:0%
through h bill 145 and h bill 197 is not
 
07:12:20.070 --> 07:12:20.080 align:start position:0%
about self-defense but is rather based
 
07:12:21.990 --> 07:12:22.000 align:start position:0%
in a racist policy and a disregard for
 
07:12:23.750 --> 07:12:23.760 align:start position:0%
the safety of granite staters
 
07:12:25.990 --> 07:12:26.000 align:start position:0%
these two bills further codify shoot now
 
07:12:28.230 --> 07:12:28.240 align:start position:0%
ask christians later and give bad actors
 
07:12:30.310 --> 07:12:30.320 align:start position:0%
a pass to unnecessarily use lethal
 
07:12:32.468 --> 07:12:32.478 align:start position:0%
violence against protesters neighbors
 
07:12:33.910 --> 07:12:33.920 align:start position:0%
and community members with whom they
 
07:12:35.590 --> 07:12:35.600 align:start position:0%
have disagreements
 
07:12:37.830 --> 07:12:37.840 align:start position:0%
h bill 197 would expand the section that
 
07:12:39.270 --> 07:12:39.280 align:start position:0%
currently permits the use of deadly
 
07:12:40.708 --> 07:12:40.718 align:start position:0%
force in order to protect yourself in
 
07:12:42.708 --> 07:12:42.718 align:start position:0%
your own home to allow the use of deadly
 
07:12:45.110 --> 07:12:45.120 align:start position:0%
force to defend other person in any
 
07:12:47.190 --> 07:12:47.200 align:start position:0%
vehicle or dwelling or an area
 
07:12:48.948 --> 07:12:48.958 align:start position:0%
immediately outside any dwelling from a
 
07:12:50.548 --> 07:12:50.558 align:start position:0%
person they think is likely to use
 
07:12:52.070 --> 07:12:52.080 align:start position:0%
unlawful force in the commission of a
 
07:12:52.080 --> 07:12:53.190 align:start position:0%
unlawful force in the commission of a
felony

07:12:53.190 --> 07:12:53.200 align:start position:0%
felony
 
07:12:55.270 --> 07:12:55.280 align:start position:0%
this bill would also also authorize the
 
07:12:57.430 --> 07:12:57.440 align:start position:0%
use of deadly force to protect any
 
07:12:59.590 --> 07:12:59.600 align:start position:0%
person in any vehicle or dwelling or
 
07:13:01.350 --> 07:13:01.360 align:start position:0%
area immediately outside a dwelling from
 
07:13:03.110 --> 07:13:03.120 align:start position:0%
a person they think is likely to use
 
07:13:05.270 --> 07:13:05.280 align:start position:0%
unlawful force in the commission of a
 
07:13:08.708 --> 07:13:08.718 align:start position:0%
riot a misdemeanor offense now i know we
 
07:13:10.628 --> 07:13:10.638 align:start position:0%
went into the discussion of riot i would
 
07:13:12.628 --> 07:13:12.638 align:start position:0%
like to say that it's uh the definition
 
07:13:14.468 --> 07:13:14.478 align:start position:0%
is extremely broad and could easily
 
07:13:15.910 --> 07:13:15.920 align:start position:0%
encompass non-violent protests and
 
07:13:17.910 --> 07:13:17.920 align:start position:0%
demonstrations whose chanting or
 
07:13:19.990 --> 07:13:20.000 align:start position:0%
marching could be viewed as tumultuous
 
07:13:22.788 --> 07:13:22.798 align:start position:0%
imposing a risk of causing public alarms
 
07:13:24.150 --> 07:13:24.160 align:start position:0%
this dangerous bill would give people
 
07:13:25.990 --> 07:13:26.000 align:start position:0%
who witnessed such nonviolent protests a
 
07:13:28.230 --> 07:13:28.240 align:start position:0%
license to kill as they could use deadly
 
07:13:30.390 --> 07:13:30.400 align:start position:0%
force shooting first even at unarmed
 
07:13:32.548 --> 07:13:32.558 align:start position:0%
non-violent demonstrators based merely
 
07:13:34.868 --> 07:13:34.878 align:start position:0%
on their claim they fear the protesters
 
07:13:36.628 --> 07:13:36.638 align:start position:0%
were likely to use force at some point
 
07:13:37.990 --> 07:13:38.000 align:start position:0%
in the future
 
07:13:39.750 --> 07:13:39.760 align:start position:0%
as a gun owner it is alarming to see
 
07:13:41.830 --> 07:13:41.840 align:start position:0%
legislation come up year after year that
 
07:13:43.750 --> 07:13:43.760 align:start position:0%
weakens or repeals any existing common
 
07:13:45.350 --> 07:13:45.360 align:start position:0%
sense gun safety laws that we have in
 
07:13:47.270 --> 07:13:47.280 align:start position:0%
new hampshire regarding firearms
 
07:13:48.948 --> 07:13:48.958 align:start position:0%
responsible gun owners see the need for
 
07:13:50.948 --> 07:13:50.958 align:start position:0%
reasonable gun laws and regulations we
 
07:13:52.310 --> 07:13:52.320 align:start position:0%
see the gun violence that kills more
 
07:13:54.628 --> 07:13:54.638 align:start position:0%
than 100 people in u.s every day and
 
07:13:57.590 --> 07:13:57.600 align:start position:0%
more than 230 that are shot and wounded
 
07:13:59.510 --> 07:13:59.520 align:start position:0%
ms reynolds we do have to limit
 
07:14:00.868 --> 07:14:00.878 align:start position:0%
testimony to
 
07:14:02.788 --> 07:14:02.798 align:start position:0%
two minutes per witness
 
07:14:04.708 --> 07:14:04.718 align:start position:0%
so if you don't mind like just
 
07:14:06.788 --> 07:14:06.798 align:start position:0%
concluding your testimony
 
07:14:15.030 --> 07:14:15.040 align:start position:0%
 
07:14:17.110 --> 07:14:17.120 align:start position:0%
sorry i'm back
 
07:14:18.948 --> 07:14:18.958 align:start position:0%

committee a petition signed by 540 new
 
07:14:24.708 --> 07:14:24.718 align:start position:0%
hampshire residents who join me in
 
07:14:27.110 --> 07:14:27.120 align:start position:0%
opposition of this bill
 
07:14:28.708 --> 07:14:28.718 align:start position:0%
uh in his veto message for background
 
07:14:30.230 --> 07:14:30.240 align:start position:0%
checks waiting periods in empty school
 
07:14:32.468 --> 07:14:32.478 align:start position:0%
zones governor sununu said existing gun
 
07:14:34.070 --> 07:14:34.080 align:start position:0%
laws fit new hampshire's culture of
 
07:14:36.230 --> 07:14:36.240 align:start position:0%
responsible gun ownership and individual
 
07:14:38.230 --> 07:14:38.240 align:start position:0%
freedom i'm holding the governor at his
 
07:14:41.430 --> 07:14:41.440 align:start position:0%
word and expect that he will veto hb 197
 
07:14:44.070 --> 07:14:44.080 align:start position:0%
hb 145 and any other gun bill should
 
07:14:45.830 --> 07:14:45.840 align:start position:0%
they reach his desk this year

yes

07:15:24.100 --> 07:15:24.110 align:start position:0%

[Music]

07:15:26.788 --> 07:15:26.798 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
07:15:29.510 --> 07:15:29.520 align:start position:0%
can you hear me all right
 
07:15:31.350 --> 07:15:31.360 align:start position:0%
yes yes we can
 
07:15:33.590 --> 07:15:33.600 align:start position:0%
great thank you thank you again for the
 
07:15:36.708 --> 07:15:36.718 align:start position:0%
opportunity to testify my name is dina
 
07:15:39.430 --> 07:15:39.440 align:start position:0%
romero i live in hannover new hampshire
 
07:15:42.548 --> 07:15:42.558 align:start position:0%
and i was born here and have lived most
 
07:15:45.830 --> 07:15:45.840 align:start position:0%
of my 70 years in new hampshire
 
07:15:51.110 --> 07:15:51.120 align:start position:0%
i am opposed to house bill 197
 
07:15:53.510 --> 07:15:53.520 align:start position:0%
if the state of new hampshire is going
 
07:15:54.788 --> 07:15:54.798 align:start position:0%
to allow
 
07:15:59.670 --> 07:15:59.680 align:start position:0%
ordinary civilians regular folks to
 
07:16:02.708 --> 07:16:02.718 align:start position:0%
protect themselves with weapons then i
 
07:16:05.110 --> 07:16:05.120 align:start position:0%
think it is incumbent on the state of
 
07:16:07.830 --> 07:16:07.840 align:start position:0%
new hampshire to prove that this is
 
07:16:11.750 --> 07:16:11.760 align:start position:0%
absolutely necessary so far i haven't
 
07:16:13.510 --> 07:16:13.520 align:start position:0%
found that
 
07:16:16.310 --> 07:16:16.320 align:start position:0%
in my research on crime in new hampshire
 
07:16:18.868 --> 07:16:18.878 align:start position:0%
i also found that new hampshire is one
 
07:16:21.190 --> 07:16:21.200 align:start position:0%
of the safest states in the in this
 
07:16:24.230 --> 07:16:24.240 align:start position:0%
country and has the third lowest violent
 
07:16:26.230 --> 07:16:26.240 align:start position:0%
crime rate and the low
 
07:16:29.510 --> 07:16:29.520 align:start position:0%
excuse me the lowest property crime rate
 
07:16:33.270 --> 07:16:33.280 align:start position:0%
in the nation so my question is why
 
07:16:35.750 --> 07:16:35.760 align:start position:0%
would we need this bill
 
07:16:37.110 --> 07:16:37.120 align:start position:0%
we also
 
07:16:39.670 --> 07:16:39.680 align:start position:0%
um in this state given that we have
 
07:16:41.990 --> 07:16:42.000 align:start position:0%
permit less carry and we don't have
 
07:16:45.110 --> 07:16:45.120 align:start position:0%
universal background checks the public
 
07:16:47.830 --> 07:16:47.840 align:start position:0%
has no guarantee that the person with
 
07:16:51.030 --> 07:16:51.040 align:start position:0%
the fire arm a knows how to use it
 
07:16:54.310 --> 07:16:54.320 align:start position:0%
b is mentally sound and would not shoot
 
07:16:54.320 --> 07:16:56.230 align:start position:0%
b is mentally sound and would not shoot
indiscriminately

07:16:56.230 --> 07:16:56.240 align:start position:0%
indiscriminately
 
07:16:59.030 --> 07:16:59.040 align:start position:0%
and c we have no guarantee that that
 
07:17:00.868 --> 07:17:00.878 align:start position:0%
person is someone who would do
 
07:17:03.990 --> 07:17:04.000 align:start position:0%
everything in their capacity to avoid
 
07:17:07.510 --> 07:17:07.520 align:start position:0%
discharging the firearm
 
07:17:10.310 --> 07:17:10.320 align:start position:0%
commission of a riot against a person in
 
07:17:13.110 --> 07:17:13.120 align:start position:0%
a vehicle i found that very difficult to
 
07:17:13.120 --> 07:17:14.868 align:start position:0%
a vehicle i found that very difficult to
understand

07:17:14.868 --> 07:17:14.878 align:start position:0%
understand
 
07:17:18.070 --> 07:17:18.080 align:start position:0%
could one person's version of a riot
 
07:17:20.708 --> 07:17:20.718 align:start position:0%
actually be another person's peaceful
 
07:17:23.910 --> 07:17:23.920 align:start position:0%
protest i think we have seen in recent
 
07:17:26.150 --> 07:17:26.160 align:start position:0%
events that this this has actually
 
07:17:28.310 --> 07:17:28.320 align:start position:0%
happened um
 
07:17:31.750 --> 07:17:31.760 align:start position:0%
and that would be a violation of our of
 
07:17:34.788 --> 07:17:34.798 align:start position:0%
the constitutional rights to assemble in
 
07:17:39.990 --> 07:17:40.000 align:start position:0%
 
07:17:41.590 --> 07:17:41.600 align:start position:0%
miss romero we do have to limit
 
07:17:43.350 --> 07:17:43.360 align:start position:0%
testimony to two minutes uh for
 
07:17:45.190 --> 07:17:45.200 align:start position:0%
whiteness if you don't mind
 
07:17:46.548 --> 07:17:46.558 align:start position:0%
concluding your testimony with one
 
07:17:50.948 --> 07:17:50.958 align:start position:0%
 
07:17:52.788 --> 07:17:52.798 align:start position:0%
thank you i was trying to make the
 
07:17:52.798 --> 07:17:54.310 align:start position:0%
thank you i was trying to make the
two-minute

07:17:54.310 --> 07:17:54.320 align:start position:0%
two-minute
 
07:17:57.110 --> 07:17:57.120 align:start position:0%
the two-minute rule um so i'll conclude
 
07:18:00.468 --> 07:18:00.478 align:start position:0%
my testimony absolutely i think you have
 
07:18:00.478 --> 07:18:01.670 align:start position:0%
my testimony absolutely i think you have
um

07:18:01.670 --> 07:18:01.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:18:04.310 --> 07:18:04.320 align:start position:0%
i think if i were sitting in your
 
07:18:07.430 --> 07:18:07.440 align:start position:0%
seats i would be looking at competing
 
07:18:10.070 --> 07:18:10.080 align:start position:0%
interests the competing interests of the
 
07:18:13.030 --> 07:18:13.040 align:start position:0%
right to bear arms and the right of the
 
07:18:15.910 --> 07:18:15.920 align:start position:0%
public to be safe
 
07:18:18.390 --> 07:18:18.400 align:start position:0%
me i would come down on the side of the
 
07:18:21.030 --> 07:18:21.040 align:start position:0%
public just because somebody has the
 
07:18:24.230 --> 07:18:24.240 align:start position:0%
right to bear arms doesn't mean that we
 
07:18:27.510 --> 07:18:27.520 align:start position:0%
should be passing 197. thank you very
 
07:18:36.788 --> 07:18:36.798 align:start position:0%
 
07:18:38.788 --> 07:18:38.798 align:start position:0%
seeing your hands raised i thank the
 
07:18:53.190 --> 07:18:53.200 align:start position:0%
 
07:18:53.200 --> 07:18:54.548 align:start position:0%
 
no

07:18:54.548 --> 07:18:54.558 align:start position:0%
no
 
07:18:58.628 --> 07:18:58.638 align:start position:0%
 
07:19:01.350 --> 07:19:01.360 align:start position:0%
yeah why
 
07:19:02.948 --> 07:19:02.958 align:start position:0%
this is bill kingston can you hear me
 
07:19:02.958 --> 07:19:06.230 align:start position:0%
this is bill kingston can you hear me
now

07:19:06.230 --> 07:19:06.240 align:start position:0%
 
07:19:20.548 --> 07:19:20.558 align:start position:0%
 
07:19:22.548 --> 07:19:22.558 align:start position:0%
mr chairman members of the committee i'm
 
07:19:24.310 --> 07:19:24.320 align:start position:0%
bill kingston the ex-marine from
 
07:19:26.948 --> 07:19:26.958 align:start position:0%
newcastle i'm speaking for myself and
 
07:19:30.310 --> 07:19:30.320 align:start position:0%
echo the concerns of the other witnesses
 
07:19:32.070 --> 07:19:32.080 align:start position:0%
in this proposed change to our current
 
07:19:34.708 --> 07:19:34.718 align:start position:0%
legislation the author wishes to invent
 
07:19:36.150 --> 07:19:36.160 align:start position:0%
an entirely new and radical
 
07:19:37.590 --> 07:19:37.600 align:start position:0%
interpretation of the right to
 
07:19:37.600 --> 07:19:39.270 align:start position:0%
interpretation of the right to
self-defense

07:19:39.270 --> 07:19:39.280 align:start position:0%
self-defense
 
07:19:41.830 --> 07:19:41.840 align:start position:0%
this change eliminates the requirement
 
07:19:43.590 --> 07:19:43.600 align:start position:0%
for all of us to use good judgment and
 
07:19:45.670 --> 07:19:45.680 align:start position:0%
instead introduces the
 
07:19:48.788 --> 07:19:48.798 align:start position:0%
flimsy and vague phrase likely to use
 
07:19:50.948 --> 07:19:50.958 align:start position:0%
any unlawful force
 
07:19:53.110 --> 07:19:53.120 align:start position:0%
this change attempts to empower any
 
07:19:53.120 --> 07:19:54.070 align:start position:0%
this change attempts to empower any
person

07:19:54.070 --> 07:19:54.080 align:start position:0%
person
 
07:19:56.628 --> 07:19:56.638 align:start position:0%
to decide for himself but another person
 
07:19:59.990 --> 07:20:00.000 align:start position:0%
is a bad guy and homicide is justifiable
 
07:20:01.910 --> 07:20:01.920 align:start position:0%
this bill does not even mention the
 
07:20:04.070 --> 07:20:04.080 align:start position:0%
words violence or threat
 
07:20:06.390 --> 07:20:06.400 align:start position:0%
a simple verbal assault would qualify as
 
07:20:08.310 --> 07:20:08.320 align:start position:0%
an unlawful force
 
07:20:10.468 --> 07:20:10.478 align:start position:0%
this is contrary to our constitutional
 
07:20:12.548 --> 07:20:12.558 align:start position:0%
doctrine of self-defense there's a
 
07:20:14.390 --> 07:20:14.400 align:start position:0%
radical departure from all our previous
 
07:20:17.990 --> 07:20:18.000 align:start position:0%
statutes and court decisions
 
07:20:20.070 --> 07:20:20.080 align:start position:0%
again this is not the new hampshire way
 
07:20:21.910 --> 07:20:21.920 align:start position:0%
therefore ladies and gentlemen i urge
 
07:20:28.708 --> 07:20:28.718 align:start position:0%
 
07:20:33.030 --> 07:20:33.040 align:start position:0%
 
07:20:35.030 --> 07:20:35.040 align:start position:0%
signal hands raise uh the witness is
 
07:20:35.040 --> 07:20:45.670 align:start position:0%
signal hands raise uh the witness is
excused

07:20:45.670 --> 07:20:45.680 align:start position:0%
 
07:20:49.030 --> 07:20:49.040 align:start position:0%
 
07:20:50.628 --> 07:20:50.638 align:start position:0%
also with us all day
 
07:20:52.150 --> 07:20:52.160 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you mr chairman and members
 
07:20:53.830 --> 07:20:53.840 align:start position:0%

07:20:55.270 --> 07:20:55.280 align:start position:0%
i'm the vice president for gun owners of
 
07:20:56.390 --> 07:20:56.400 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
07:20:59.350 --> 07:20:59.360 align:start position:0%
and i'd like to testify in support of hb
 
07:20:59.360 --> 07:21:01.670 align:start position:0%
and i'd like to testify in support of hb
197

07:21:01.670 --> 07:21:01.680 align:start position:0%
197
 
07:21:03.270 --> 07:21:03.280 align:start position:0%
i'd like to start by saying my life and
 
07:21:05.350 --> 07:21:05.360 align:start position:0%
the lives of my loved ones are no less
 
07:21:07.270 --> 07:21:07.280 align:start position:0%
important when we're freely traveling in
 
07:21:08.948 --> 07:21:08.958 align:start position:0%
our car than we're in than when we are
 
07:21:10.310 --> 07:21:10.320 align:start position:0%
in our homes
 
07:21:11.990 --> 07:21:12.000 align:start position:0%
uh that distinction should not be made
 
07:21:14.948 --> 07:21:14.958 align:start position:0%
in the law we are guaranteed under the
 
07:21:16.708 --> 07:21:16.718 align:start position:0%
new hampshire state constitution the
 
07:21:18.230 --> 07:21:18.240 align:start position:0%
right to protect our lives and our
 
07:21:18.240 --> 07:21:19.590 align:start position:0%
right to protect our lives and our
property

07:21:19.590 --> 07:21:19.600 align:start position:0%
property
 
07:21:22.548 --> 07:21:22.558 align:start position:0%
and um this law does not give someone
 
07:21:25.110 --> 07:21:25.120 align:start position:0%
indestrument ability to use vigilantism
 
07:21:27.750 --> 07:21:27.760 align:start position:0%
or to seek out trouble
 
07:21:29.830 --> 07:21:29.840 align:start position:0%
if anything it's it's only when the
 
07:21:31.910 --> 07:21:31.920 align:start position:0%
trouble has been brought to you
 
07:21:34.468 --> 07:21:34.478 align:start position:0%
uh the people talking about riot who
 
07:21:36.708 --> 07:21:36.718 align:start position:0%
determines what a riot is
 
07:21:38.708 --> 07:21:38.718 align:start position:0%
if you read this the statute itself it
 
07:21:40.868 --> 07:21:40.878 align:start position:0%
doesn't say you know what the person
 
07:21:42.628 --> 07:21:42.638 align:start position:0%
perceives to be the right you know
 
07:21:44.390 --> 07:21:44.400 align:start position:0%
there's a certain element of men's ray
 
07:21:46.230 --> 07:21:46.240 align:start position:0%
of the understanding of the criminal
 
07:21:48.468 --> 07:21:48.478 align:start position:0%
intent does the person committing the
 
07:21:50.468 --> 07:21:50.478 align:start position:0%
act think they're committing a riot now
 
07:21:51.830 --> 07:21:51.840 align:start position:0%
they may not know the legal definition
 
07:21:53.510 --> 07:21:53.520 align:start position:0%
but if they know that they are
 
07:21:53.520 --> 07:21:54.788 align:start position:0%
but if they know that they are
um

07:21:54.788 --> 07:21:54.798 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:21:56.548 --> 07:21:56.558 align:start position:0%
purposefully committing a crime with
 
07:21:58.150 --> 07:21:58.160 align:start position:0%
them themselves or other people than
 
07:22:00.310 --> 07:22:00.320 align:start position:0%
they they would be but the person it's
 
07:22:01.750 --> 07:22:01.760 align:start position:0%
not just one or two people coming up to
 
07:22:03.830 --> 07:22:03.840 align:start position:0%
your car and starting trouble a riot is
 
07:22:05.910 --> 07:22:05.920 align:start position:0%
two or more other people so there has to
 
07:22:08.070 --> 07:22:08.080 align:start position:0%
be at least three people coming to you
 
07:22:09.670 --> 07:22:09.680 align:start position:0%
and someone in their vehicle is at a
 
07:22:11.430 --> 07:22:11.440 align:start position:0%
distinct tactical disadvantage they're
 
07:22:13.270 --> 07:22:13.280 align:start position:0%
in a seated position they are belted in
 
07:22:15.190 --> 07:22:15.200 align:start position:0%
they are unable to move and if someone
 
07:22:17.750 --> 07:22:17.760 align:start position:0%
is coming with a violent intent
 
07:22:19.750 --> 07:22:19.760 align:start position:0%
and and using force in the commission of
 
07:22:21.430 --> 07:22:21.440 align:start position:0%
a felony against that person in their
 
07:22:23.030 --> 07:22:23.040 align:start position:0%
vehicle or someone else
 
07:22:24.468 --> 07:22:24.478 align:start position:0%
they're very there's very little
 
07:22:25.910 --> 07:22:25.920 align:start position:0%
recourse other than running them over
 
07:22:27.510 --> 07:22:27.520 align:start position:0%
with the vehicle which we've heard is
 
07:22:29.030 --> 07:22:29.040 align:start position:0%
just as dangerous not more than
 
07:22:29.040 --> 07:22:30.070 align:start position:0%
just as dangerous not more than
dangerous

07:22:30.070 --> 07:22:30.080 align:start position:0%
dangerous
 
07:22:32.310 --> 07:22:32.320 align:start position:0%
uh do we want someone in a in a crowded
 
07:22:33.990 --> 07:22:34.000 align:start position:0%
situation where there's a riot or some
 
07:22:35.750 --> 07:22:35.760 align:start position:0%
kind of mass protest and there are some
 
07:22:38.150 --> 07:22:38.160 align:start position:0%
rioters at a peaceful protest do we want
 
07:22:40.390 --> 07:22:40.400 align:start position:0%
that driver to just hit the gas and run
 
07:22:42.628 --> 07:22:42.638 align:start position:0%
through the crowd and probably hurt some
 
07:22:43.830 --> 07:22:43.840 align:start position:0%
innocent people
 
07:22:45.350 --> 07:22:45.360 align:start position:0%
or do we want that person to be able to
 
07:22:47.430 --> 07:22:47.440 align:start position:0%
respond specifically to the threat at
 
07:22:49.510 --> 07:22:49.520 align:start position:0%
hand and i think this bill is something
 
07:22:52.548 --> 07:22:52.558 align:start position:0%
very necessary to make that
 
07:22:54.628 --> 07:22:54.638 align:start position:0%
allowable in this state and very clear
 
07:22:56.150 --> 07:22:56.160 align:start position:0%
to people
 
07:22:56.160 --> 07:22:57.670 align:start position:0%
to people
um

07:22:57.670 --> 07:22:57.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:22:59.670 --> 07:22:59.680 align:start position:0%
pretty much we also heard that you know
 
07:23:01.190 --> 07:23:01.200 align:start position:0%
you can defend yourself on your property
 
07:23:02.468 --> 07:23:02.478 align:start position:0%
some people against this bill said they
 
07:23:03.910 --> 07:23:03.920 align:start position:0%
have no problem with defending yourself
 
07:23:05.830 --> 07:23:05.840 align:start position:0%
on your property this kind of just
 
07:23:07.350 --> 07:23:07.360 align:start position:0%
changes it to defending yourself in your
 
07:23:07.360 --> 07:23:08.468 align:start position:0%
changes it to defending yourself in your
property

07:23:08.468 --> 07:23:08.478 align:start position:0%
property
 
07:23:09.590 --> 07:23:09.600 align:start position:0%
in a sense
 
07:23:11.110 --> 07:23:11.120 align:start position:0%
so um
 
07:23:12.788 --> 07:23:12.798 align:start position:0%
i'm in strong support of this bill and
 
07:23:17.270 --> 07:23:17.280 align:start position:0%
 
07:23:19.270 --> 07:23:19.280 align:start position:0%
representative marston thank you mr
 
07:23:19.280 --> 07:23:20.788 align:start position:0%
representative marston thank you mr
chairman

07:23:20.788 --> 07:23:20.798 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
07:23:22.788 --> 07:23:22.798 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking a question i didn't
 
07:23:24.788 --> 07:23:24.798 align:start position:0%
understand your last statement are you
 
07:23:27.750 --> 07:23:27.760 align:start position:0%
in favor of the bill or opposed
 
07:23:29.350 --> 07:23:29.360 align:start position:0%
strongly in favor
 
07:23:33.430 --> 07:23:33.440 align:start position:0%
 
07:23:37.190 --> 07:23:37.200 align:start position:0%
let me ask a question by dr him yes
 
07:23:39.830 --> 07:23:39.840 align:start position:0%
so where where i get
 
07:23:42.150 --> 07:23:42.160 align:start position:0%
concerned is just i mean it really this
 
07:23:44.310 --> 07:23:44.320 align:start position:0%
is this is something again i it pretty
 
07:23:46.070 --> 07:23:46.080 align:start position:0%
exists as the this
 
07:23:48.788 --> 07:23:48.798 align:start position:0%
hp 197 is
 
07:23:50.868 --> 07:23:50.878 align:start position:0%
from the definition of
 
07:23:50.878 --> 07:23:52.548 align:start position:0%
from the definition of
rioting

07:23:52.548 --> 07:23:52.558 align:start position:0%
rioting
 
07:23:54.708 --> 07:23:54.718 align:start position:0%
which is the members of the committee
 
07:23:58.150 --> 07:23:58.160 align:start position:0%
it's rsa 644
 
07:23:58.160 --> 07:23:59.910 align:start position:0%
it's rsa 644
1.

07:23:59.910 --> 07:23:59.920 align:start position:0%
1.
 
07:24:02.150 --> 07:24:02.160 align:start position:0%
my concern is
 
07:24:04.708 --> 07:24:04.718 align:start position:0%
what happens when you have a thousand
 
07:24:06.070 --> 07:24:06.080 align:start position:0%
people in the street
 
07:24:06.080 --> 07:24:07.030 align:start position:0%
people in the street
and

07:24:07.030 --> 07:24:07.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
07:24:08.708 --> 07:24:08.718 align:start position:0%
all of a sudden
 
07:24:10.548 --> 07:24:10.558 align:start position:0%
just because people are protesting very
 
07:24:13.030 --> 07:24:13.040 align:start position:0%
loud or
 
07:24:14.390 --> 07:24:14.400 align:start position:0%
four or five people out of those
 
07:24:17.350 --> 07:24:17.360 align:start position:0%
thousands deviate from the protest and
 
07:24:20.070 --> 07:24:20.080 align:start position:0%
all of a sudden become very violent
 
07:24:22.390 --> 07:24:22.400 align:start position:0%
is how do you know i i'm having trouble
 
07:24:24.150 --> 07:24:24.160 align:start position:0%
distinguishing how everyone's staying
 
07:24:26.150 --> 07:24:26.160 align:start position:0%
separated i understand if you're
 
07:24:27.670 --> 07:24:27.680 align:start position:0%
you know on one opposite end of the
 
07:24:29.590 --> 07:24:29.600 align:start position:0%
crowd as opposed to the other but if the
 
07:24:31.190 --> 07:24:31.200 align:start position:0%
person sitting next to me starts
 
07:24:33.110 --> 07:24:33.120 align:start position:0%
pounding on your window or
 
07:24:35.990 --> 07:24:36.000 align:start position:0%
trying to break your car window
 
07:24:38.708 --> 07:24:38.718 align:start position:0%
i i obviously wouldn't um
 
07:24:40.468 --> 07:24:40.478 align:start position:0%
i wouldn't support that type of action
 
07:24:42.230 --> 07:24:42.240 align:start position:0%
but first it's next thing so i'm
 
07:24:44.150 --> 07:24:44.160 align:start position:0%
wondering how do you
 
07:24:46.150 --> 07:24:46.160 align:start position:0%
separate that and maybe we need to work
 
07:24:47.910 --> 07:24:47.920 align:start position:0%
on the definition of rioting as opposed
 
07:24:51.190 --> 07:24:51.200 align:start position:0%
to the policy itself
 
07:24:52.868 --> 07:24:52.878 align:start position:0%
the rioting chapter thank you for the
 
07:24:54.548 --> 07:24:54.558 align:start position:0%
question the writing chapter was
 
07:24:56.708 --> 07:24:56.718 align:start position:0%
initially written in 1971 the same year
 
07:24:58.390 --> 07:24:58.400 align:start position:0%
that the
 
07:25:00.070 --> 07:25:00.080 align:start position:0%
section on justified use of force
 
07:25:01.510 --> 07:25:01.520 align:start position:0%
section was written so there probably
 
07:25:04.390 --> 07:25:04.400 align:start position:0%
was some uh thought given given in that
 
07:25:07.030 --> 07:25:07.040 align:start position:0%
year of the legislature but um if
 
07:25:08.628 --> 07:25:08.638 align:start position:0%
someone's say on the ground not in a
 
07:25:09.910 --> 07:25:09.920 align:start position:0%
vehicle and they're being beaten by a
 
07:25:11.590 --> 07:25:11.600 align:start position:0%
crowd of people and there's 20 people
 
07:25:12.868 --> 07:25:12.878 align:start position:0%
around them but only five of them are
 
07:25:14.628 --> 07:25:14.638 align:start position:0%
kicking that person in the head
 
07:25:16.468 --> 07:25:16.478 align:start position:0%
and you know they have a knife or a gun
 
07:25:17.830 --> 07:25:17.840 align:start position:0%
on them does that person have to
 
07:25:19.670 --> 07:25:19.680 align:start position:0%
specifically determine who's kicking
 
07:25:21.270 --> 07:25:21.280 align:start position:0%
them in the head decide to decide to
 
07:25:23.270 --> 07:25:23.280 align:start position:0%
defend themselves their life is at risk
 
07:25:24.868 --> 07:25:24.878 align:start position:0%
the lives of any potentially innocent
 
07:25:26.548 --> 07:25:26.558 align:start position:0%
bystanders would be on the shoulders of
 
07:25:27.750 --> 07:25:27.760 align:start position:0%
the people that are kicking them in the
 
07:25:29.190 --> 07:25:29.200 align:start position:0%
head and maybe the crowd that's cheering
 
07:25:30.788 --> 07:25:30.798 align:start position:0%
them on or videotaping it to put on
 
07:25:30.798 --> 07:25:31.910 align:start position:0%
them on or videotaping it to put on
youtube

07:25:31.910 --> 07:25:31.920 align:start position:0%
youtube
 
07:25:33.910 --> 07:25:33.920 align:start position:0%
um you know i don't have the answers for
 
07:25:35.830 --> 07:25:35.840 align:start position:0%
all of those scenarios but i do think
 
07:25:38.230 --> 07:25:38.240 align:start position:0%
that when someone's life is in in grave
 
07:25:40.708 --> 07:25:40.718 align:start position:0%
danger or um they have been in a
 
07:25:42.548 --> 07:25:42.558 align:start position:0%
situation where they're they're in a
 
07:25:44.468 --> 07:25:44.478 align:start position:0%
substantial they've been put in a
 
07:25:45.910 --> 07:25:45.920 align:start position:0%
position where there's a substantial
 
07:25:48.468 --> 07:25:48.478 align:start position:0%
risk of uh public alarm
 
07:25:48.478 --> 07:25:49.510 align:start position:0%
risk of uh public alarm
um

07:25:49.510 --> 07:25:49.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:25:51.750 --> 07:25:51.760 align:start position:0%
i don't think that needs to be uh worked
 
07:25:54.830 --> 07:25:54.840 align:start position:0%
out in the le in this law any
 
07:25:57.590 --> 07:25:57.600 align:start position:0%
further i just may ask you a follow-up
 
07:25:57.600 --> 07:26:01.590 align:start position:0%
further i just may ask you a follow-up
please

07:26:01.590 --> 07:26:01.600 align:start position:0%
 
07:26:02.788 --> 07:26:02.798 align:start position:0%
make sure i work this correctly so i'm
 
07:26:05.670 --> 07:26:05.680 align:start position:0%
 
07:26:05.680 --> 07:26:07.750 align:start position:0%
 
so

07:26:07.750 --> 07:26:07.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
07:26:10.468 --> 07:26:10.478 align:start position:0%
if we if there was an amendment to
 
07:26:10.478 --> 07:26:12.628 align:start position:0%
if we if there was an amendment to
maybe

07:26:12.628 --> 07:26:12.638 align:start position:0%
maybe
 
07:26:14.310 --> 07:26:14.320 align:start position:0%
narrow the definition of writing to
 
07:26:14.320 --> 07:26:15.670 align:start position:0%
narrow the definition of writing to
clarify

07:26:15.670 --> 07:26:15.680 align:start position:0%
clarify
 
07:26:18.628 --> 07:26:18.638 align:start position:0%
the concern that i have
 
07:26:21.590 --> 07:26:21.600 align:start position:0%
 
07:26:36.948 --> 07:26:36.958 align:start position:0%
 
07:26:36.958 --> 07:26:37.750 align:start position:0%
 
um

07:26:37.750 --> 07:26:37.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:26:39.990 --> 07:26:40.000 align:start position:0%
i'm wondering if you have read
 
07:26:40.000 --> 07:26:41.110 align:start position:0%
i'm wondering if you have read
a

07:26:41.110 --> 07:26:41.120 align:start position:0%
a
 
07:26:43.110 --> 07:26:43.120 align:start position:0%
paragraph to a person that's just upon
 
07:26:45.190 --> 07:26:45.200 align:start position:0%
using deadly force upon another person
 
07:26:47.910 --> 07:26:47.920 align:start position:0%
women reason who believes that such
 
07:26:51.190 --> 07:26:51.200 align:start position:0%
other person a is about to use unlawful
 
07:26:53.110 --> 07:26:53.120 align:start position:0%
deadly force against the factor of this
 
07:26:53.120 --> 07:26:54.388 align:start position:0%
deadly force against the factor of this
person

07:26:54.388 --> 07:26:54.398 align:start position:0%
person
 
07:26:56.708 --> 07:26:56.718 align:start position:0%
now that seems to me
 
07:26:56.718 --> 07:26:57.670 align:start position:0%
now that seems to me
cover

07:26:57.670 --> 07:26:57.680 align:start position:0%
cover
 
07:26:57.680 --> 07:26:59.030 align:start position:0%
cover
uh

07:26:59.030 --> 07:26:59.040 align:start position:0%
uh
 
07:27:01.430 --> 07:27:01.440 align:start position:0%
what is being told
 
07:27:03.030 --> 07:27:03.040 align:start position:0%
except that
 
07:27:04.468 --> 07:27:04.478 align:start position:0%
in proposal
 
07:27:04.478 --> 07:27:05.590 align:start position:0%
in proposal
uh

07:27:05.590 --> 07:27:05.600 align:start position:0%
uh
 
07:27:07.830 --> 07:27:07.840 align:start position:0%
we're talking about unlawful force
 
07:27:09.830 --> 07:27:09.840 align:start position:0%
rather than deadly force
 
07:27:12.388 --> 07:27:12.398 align:start position:0%
and uh while you're there can you maybe
 
07:27:15.190 --> 07:27:15.200 align:start position:0%
give me a definition of uh unlawful
 
07:27:15.200 --> 07:27:17.030 align:start position:0%
give me a definition of uh unlawful
force

07:27:17.030 --> 07:27:17.040 align:start position:0%
force
 
07:27:17.040 --> 07:27:18.628 align:start position:0%
force
um

07:27:18.628 --> 07:27:18.638 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:27:19.750 --> 07:27:19.760 align:start position:0%
actually i
 
07:27:20.868 --> 07:27:20.878 align:start position:0%
don't know if i can give you the
 
07:27:22.708 --> 07:27:22.718 align:start position:0%
specific definition but it would be it
 
07:27:24.070 --> 07:27:24.080 align:start position:0%
would have to be unlawful force in the
 
07:27:25.910 --> 07:27:25.920 align:start position:0%
commission of a felony i can say that
 
07:27:27.270 --> 07:27:27.280 align:start position:0%
much because that is in the language of
 
07:27:29.590 --> 07:27:29.600 align:start position:0%
the propos of the existing law
 
07:27:29.600 --> 07:27:30.948 align:start position:0%
the propos of the existing law
um

07:27:30.948 --> 07:27:30.958 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:27:33.350 --> 07:27:33.360 align:start position:0%
the other thing i would say is uh you
 
07:27:35.110 --> 07:27:35.120 align:start position:0%
know when someone is seated in a vehicle
 
07:27:36.948 --> 07:27:36.958 align:start position:0%
they are at a distinct disadvantage if
 
07:27:38.468 --> 07:27:38.478 align:start position:0%
someone approaches me on the sidewalk
 
07:27:41.350 --> 07:27:41.360 align:start position:0%
and i'm about a 200 pound moderately fit
 
07:27:42.230 --> 07:27:42.240 align:start position:0%
you know
 
07:27:44.948 --> 07:27:44.958 align:start position:0%
guy i i can probably defend myself
 
07:27:46.948 --> 07:27:46.958 align:start position:0%
against a single attacker without lethal
 
07:27:48.948 --> 07:27:48.958 align:start position:0%
fort without a lethal weapon
 
07:27:51.110 --> 07:27:51.120 align:start position:0%
but say i'm in a wheelchair or i'm
 
07:27:52.548 --> 07:27:52.558 align:start position:0%
strapped into a chair sitting on the
 
07:27:54.468 --> 07:27:54.478 align:start position:0%
sidewalk i'm in a distinct disadvantage
 
07:27:55.910 --> 07:27:55.920 align:start position:0%
so having a law to protect someone
 
07:27:58.388 --> 07:27:58.398 align:start position:0%
sitting in a vehicle that you know is
 
07:28:00.868 --> 07:28:00.878 align:start position:0%
assumingly seat belted in and unable to
 
07:28:03.190 --> 07:28:03.200 align:start position:0%
move is at a distinct disadvantage so i
 
07:28:04.868 --> 07:28:04.878 align:start position:0%
think the law has to allow for more
 
07:28:06.310 --> 07:28:06.320 align:start position:0%
leeway for that person to defend
 
07:28:06.320 --> 07:28:12.948 align:start position:0%
leeway for that person to defend
themselves

07:28:12.948 --> 07:28:12.958 align:start position:0%
 
07:28:14.948 --> 07:28:14.958 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
07:28:17.990 --> 07:28:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
07:28:19.910 --> 07:28:19.920 align:start position:0%
seeing no additional questions i want to
 
07:28:22.628 --> 07:28:22.638 align:start position:0%
thank thank uh the doctor for his
 
07:28:24.310 --> 07:28:24.320 align:start position:0%
testimony and
 
07:28:25.830 --> 07:28:25.840 align:start position:0%
appreciate your basis and spend the
 
07:28:26.948 --> 07:28:26.958 align:start position:0%
whole day with us
 
07:28:32.868 --> 07:28:32.878 align:start position:0%
 
07:28:55.350 --> 07:28:55.360 align:start position:0%
 
07:28:56.830 --> 07:28:56.840 align:start position:0%
oh there we
 
07:28:59.990 --> 07:29:00.000 align:start position:0%
go uh
 
07:29:01.990 --> 07:29:02.000 align:start position:0%
thank you uh mr chair i'm not gonna
 
07:29:03.670 --> 07:29:03.680 align:start position:0%
cover anything that was uh that's
 
07:29:05.190 --> 07:29:05.200 align:start position:0%
already been mentioned
 
07:29:06.868 --> 07:29:06.878 align:start position:0%
i am a co-sponsor on this bill i
 
07:29:08.628 --> 07:29:08.638 align:start position:0%
understand that members have an issue
 
07:29:08.638 --> 07:29:09.430 align:start position:0%
understand that members have an issue
with

07:29:09.430 --> 07:29:09.440 align:start position:0%
with
 
07:29:11.350 --> 07:29:11.360 align:start position:0%
uh proposed part e
 
07:29:13.030 --> 07:29:13.040 align:start position:0%
and i think that the
 
07:29:15.110 --> 07:29:15.120 align:start position:0%
deletion of that line wouldn't uh
 
07:29:17.750 --> 07:29:17.760 align:start position:0%
adversely affect it just leaving a
 
07:29:21.510 --> 07:29:21.520 align:start position:0%
inclusion of any person's vehicle
 
07:29:23.110 --> 07:29:23.120 align:start position:0%
should be fine to accomplish what we're
 
07:29:25.190 --> 07:29:25.200 align:start position:0%
what we're trying to accomplish
 
07:29:27.430 --> 07:29:27.440 align:start position:0%
i will give members an example of a case
 
07:29:29.990 --> 07:29:30.000 align:start position:0%
from june 2nd 2020.
 
07:29:31.750 --> 07:29:31.760 align:start position:0%
um the news coverage has kind of changed
 
07:29:33.750 --> 07:29:33.760 align:start position:0%
around a bit but this this was the one
 
07:29:35.510 --> 07:29:35.520 align:start position:0%
of the famous cases
 
07:29:37.350 --> 07:29:37.360 align:start position:0%
where um
 
07:29:39.910 --> 07:29:39.920 align:start position:0%
a group of black lives matter protesters
 
07:29:42.468 --> 07:29:42.478 align:start position:0%
in tulsa
 
07:29:44.310 --> 07:29:44.320 align:start position:0%
occupied the freeway but they occupied
 
07:29:46.388 --> 07:29:46.398 align:start position:0%
not just the side they came in and
 
07:29:47.830 --> 07:29:47.840 align:start position:0%
blocked part of traffic part of the
 
07:29:47.840 --> 07:29:50.070 align:start position:0%
blocked part of traffic part of the
lanes

07:29:50.070 --> 07:29:50.080 align:start position:0%
lanes
 
07:29:51.830 --> 07:29:51.840 align:start position:0%
and the
 
07:29:53.670 --> 07:29:53.680 align:start position:0%
according to the story the driver was
 
07:29:55.030 --> 07:29:55.040 align:start position:0%
accompanied by his wife and two
 
07:29:56.868 --> 07:29:56.878 align:start position:0%
daughters in the truck according to
 
07:29:58.628 --> 07:29:58.638 align:start position:0%
tulsa world photographer mike simmons
 
07:30:00.310 --> 07:30:00.320 align:start position:0%
who was on the scene protesters first
 
07:30:01.830 --> 07:30:01.840 align:start position:0%
blocked the path of the truck and driver
 
07:30:03.590 --> 07:30:03.600 align:start position:0%
which forced him to come to a sudden
 
07:30:03.600 --> 07:30:04.468 align:start position:0%
which forced him to come to a sudden
stop

07:30:04.468 --> 07:30:04.478 align:start position:0%
stop
 
07:30:06.388 --> 07:30:06.398 align:start position:0%
uh the driver then put a handgun on his
 
07:30:08.310 --> 07:30:08.320 align:start position:0%
dashboard which angered the protesters
 
07:30:10.150 --> 07:30:10.160 align:start position:0%
who began throwing water bottles at the
 
07:30:10.160 --> 07:30:11.590 align:start position:0%
who began throwing water bottles at the
rig

07:30:11.590 --> 07:30:11.600 align:start position:0%
rig
 
07:30:13.030 --> 07:30:13.040 align:start position:0%
the driver then accelerated through the
 
07:30:14.948 --> 07:30:14.958 align:start position:0%
crowd and that sent two people to the
 
07:30:16.868 --> 07:30:16.878 align:start position:0%
hospital with minor injuries
 
07:30:19.430 --> 07:30:19.440 align:start position:0%
some of those facts are disputed and you
 
07:30:21.830 --> 07:30:21.840 align:start position:0%
know who started first as disputed but
 
07:30:21.840 --> 07:30:22.468 align:start position:0%
know who started first as disputed but
they

07:30:22.468 --> 07:30:22.478 align:start position:0%
they
 
07:30:24.310 --> 07:30:24.320 align:start position:0%
they attacked the
 
07:30:27.910 --> 07:30:27.920 align:start position:0%
the driver they broke his rear window um
 
07:30:29.270 --> 07:30:29.280 align:start position:0%
and it was later determined that there
 
07:30:30.788 --> 07:30:30.798 align:start position:0%
wasn't a horse in the horse trailer at
 
07:30:32.788 --> 07:30:32.798 align:start position:0%
the time but
 
07:30:34.310 --> 07:30:34.320 align:start position:0%
the concern is
 
07:30:36.150 --> 07:30:36.160 align:start position:0%
is here's someone who's under attack and
 
07:30:38.628 --> 07:30:38.638 align:start position:0%
he has his wife and kids in the vehicle
 
07:30:39.830 --> 07:30:39.840 align:start position:0%
at the time
 
07:30:42.230 --> 07:30:42.240 align:start position:0%
are we telling
 
07:30:43.990 --> 07:30:44.000 align:start position:0%
private citizens who are simply trying
 
07:30:46.150 --> 07:30:46.160 align:start position:0%
to escape a violent attack
 
07:30:48.548 --> 07:30:48.558 align:start position:0%
that they have that that
 
07:30:50.230 --> 07:30:50.240 align:start position:0%
uh criminals or violent people or
 
07:30:53.270 --> 07:30:53.280 align:start position:0%
rioters can attack injure commit uh
 
07:30:55.910 --> 07:30:55.920 align:start position:0%
felony level crime against a driver or
 
07:30:57.110 --> 07:30:57.120 align:start position:0%
their family
 
07:30:58.948 --> 07:30:58.958 align:start position:0%
and uh the reason that we have
 
07:31:00.948 --> 07:31:00.958 align:start position:0%
self-defense laws in case is that we
 
07:31:03.430 --> 07:31:03.440 align:start position:0%
don't allow criminals to use the state
 
07:31:05.830 --> 07:31:05.840 align:start position:0%
as a weapon to victimize other people we
 
07:31:09.270 --> 07:31:09.280 align:start position:0%
don't allow criminals to attack people
 
07:31:11.030 --> 07:31:11.040 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm going to object to all the
 
07:31:12.948 --> 07:31:12.958 align:start position:0%
comments made earlier about self-defense
 
07:31:14.868 --> 07:31:14.878 align:start position:0%
laws being racist i've introduced
 
07:31:17.030 --> 07:31:17.040 align:start position:0%
self-defense laws specifically to help
 
07:31:18.548 --> 07:31:18.558 align:start position:0%
people of color
 
07:31:20.948 --> 07:31:20.958 align:start position:0%
poor people and people who have a very
 
07:31:22.548 --> 07:31:22.558 align:start position:0%
difficult time defending themselves in
 
07:31:22.558 --> 07:31:24.230 align:start position:0%
difficult time defending themselves in
court

07:31:24.230 --> 07:31:24.240 align:start position:0%
court
 
07:31:25.990 --> 07:31:26.000 align:start position:0%
people of color have had a very
 
07:31:30.150 --> 07:31:30.160 align:start position:0%
 
07:31:32.628 --> 07:31:32.638 align:start position:0%
raising a self-defense claim in court
 
07:31:34.310 --> 07:31:34.320 align:start position:0%
they're less likely to believe be
 
07:31:35.670 --> 07:31:35.680 align:start position:0%
believed they're more likely to be
 
07:31:38.310 --> 07:31:38.320 align:start position:0%
charged they get charged uh more
 
07:31:38.320 --> 07:31:39.510 align:start position:0%
charged they get charged uh more
severely

07:31:39.510 --> 07:31:39.520 align:start position:0%
severely
 
07:31:42.230 --> 07:31:42.240 align:start position:0%
and i think that the part of the intent
 
07:31:44.468 --> 07:31:44.478 align:start position:0%
of improving our self-defense laws is so
 
07:31:45.910 --> 07:31:45.920 align:start position:0%
that people of color not being
 
07:31:48.070 --> 07:31:48.080 align:start position:0%
overcharged over sentenced and losing
 
07:31:49.590 --> 07:31:49.600 align:start position:0%
their right to defend themselves i think
 
07:31:52.230 --> 07:31:52.240 align:start position:0%
that a lot of the crime that occurs
 
07:31:54.388 --> 07:31:54.398 align:start position:0%
in some poor and predominantly minority
 
07:31:56.070 --> 07:31:56.080 align:start position:0%
communities is happening because the
 
07:31:57.350 --> 07:31:57.360 align:start position:0%
right to self-defense is being
 
07:32:03.670 --> 07:32:03.680 align:start position:0%
 
07:32:05.510 --> 07:32:05.520 align:start position:0%
representative abrams i thank you for
 
07:32:07.750 --> 07:32:07.760 align:start position:0%
your question i if you don't mind i have
 
07:32:08.788 --> 07:32:08.798 align:start position:0%
a question
 
07:32:11.270 --> 07:32:11.280 align:start position:0%
you may have heard me ask a few of the
 
07:32:13.510 --> 07:32:13.520 align:start position:0%
prior witnesses about
 
07:32:15.270 --> 07:32:15.280 align:start position:0%
more concerns i have
 
07:32:16.868 --> 07:32:16.878 align:start position:0%
not with their goal i understand the
 
07:32:18.310 --> 07:32:18.320 align:start position:0%
goal what um
 
07:32:21.670 --> 07:32:21.680 align:start position:0%
hb 197 was attempting to accomplish
 
07:32:23.430 --> 07:32:23.440 align:start position:0%
i'm just concerned with by accomplishing
 
07:32:25.030 --> 07:32:25.040 align:start position:0%
that goal and then applying it to the
 
07:32:26.788 --> 07:32:26.798 align:start position:0%
definition of variety
 
07:32:28.548 --> 07:32:28.558 align:start position:0%
but do you
 
07:32:30.788 --> 07:32:30.798 align:start position:0%
do you have any thoughts on perhaps that
 
07:32:32.948 --> 07:32:32.958 align:start position:0%
being a misunderstanding because even
 
07:32:34.628 --> 07:32:34.638 align:start position:0%
what you described as the example that
 
07:32:37.750 --> 07:32:37.760 align:start position:0%
happened in was it tulsa
 
07:32:39.830 --> 07:32:39.840 align:start position:0%
it sounds to me that
 
07:32:41.030 --> 07:32:41.040 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure how many people were there
 
07:32:43.110 --> 07:32:43.120 align:start position:0%
but i'm sure not every single person
 
07:32:43.120 --> 07:32:44.230 align:start position:0%
but i'm sure not every single person
there

07:32:44.230 --> 07:32:44.240 align:start position:0%
there
 
07:32:44.240 --> 07:32:45.350 align:start position:0%
there
was

07:32:45.350 --> 07:32:45.360 align:start position:0%
was
 
07:32:47.430 --> 07:32:47.440 align:start position:0%
supportive of the violent past it's
 
07:32:49.030 --> 07:32:49.040 align:start position:0%
that's i'm just trying to distinguish
 
07:32:49.040 --> 07:32:50.230 align:start position:0%
that's i'm just trying to distinguish
between

07:32:50.230 --> 07:32:50.240 align:start position:0%
between
 
07:32:53.910 --> 07:32:53.920 align:start position:0%
the two because we are this will allow
 
07:32:56.388 --> 07:32:56.398 align:start position:0%
deadly force to to use or physical force
 
07:32:56.398 --> 07:32:58.070 align:start position:0%
deadly force to to use or physical force
speed

07:32:58.070 --> 07:32:58.080 align:start position:0%
speed
 
07:33:00.468 --> 07:33:00.478 align:start position:0%
and we just want to make sure that it's
 
07:33:03.270 --> 07:33:03.280 align:start position:0%
clear that a person who
 
07:33:05.430 --> 07:33:05.440 align:start position:0%
is not intending to be involved in this
 
07:33:08.388 --> 07:33:08.398 align:start position:0%
at least the violence part of this is uh
 
07:33:12.070 --> 07:33:12.080 align:start position:0%
 
07:33:13.910 --> 07:33:13.920 align:start position:0%
right uh and the the law already pretty
 
07:33:16.070 --> 07:33:16.080 align:start position:0%
well covers that it's not self-defense
 
07:33:17.670 --> 07:33:17.680 align:start position:0%
and it's never been self-defense if you
 
07:33:19.430 --> 07:33:19.440 align:start position:0%
go out and attack like if they if
 
07:33:20.868 --> 07:33:20.878 align:start position:0%
somebody swerved in their car and
 
07:33:23.830 --> 07:33:23.840 align:start position:0%
attacked a bystander
 
07:33:25.750 --> 07:33:25.760 align:start position:0%
well you may be
 
07:33:28.788 --> 07:33:28.798 align:start position:0%
uh acquitted or maybe not even charged
 
07:33:30.388 --> 07:33:30.398 align:start position:0%
for hitting the people attacking your
 
07:33:32.468 --> 07:33:32.478 align:start position:0%
vehicle the problem in the tulsa case
 
07:33:34.230 --> 07:33:34.240 align:start position:0%
and npr had another story i didn't
 
07:33:37.670 --> 07:33:37.680 align:start position:0%
mention uh been a a big spike in
 
07:33:40.310 --> 07:33:40.320 align:start position:0%
rioters attacking vehicles
 
07:33:42.708 --> 07:33:42.718 align:start position:0%
in that case the two attackers who were
 
07:33:44.388 --> 07:33:44.398 align:start position:0%
hit and sent to the hospital with minor
 
07:33:45.990 --> 07:33:46.000 align:start position:0%
injuries were in front of the vehicle
 
07:33:48.070 --> 07:33:48.080 align:start position:0%
they ran in front of the vehicle in the
 
07:33:49.990 --> 07:33:50.000 align:start position:0%
video they're both attacking
 
07:33:52.310 --> 07:33:52.320 align:start position:0%
the vehicle the attackers who were
 
07:33:54.150 --> 07:33:54.160 align:start position:0%
behind who smashed the rear window and
 
07:33:55.830 --> 07:33:55.840 align:start position:0%
were throwing bottles
 
07:33:58.150 --> 07:33:58.160 align:start position:0%
um and who knows what other things were
 
07:34:00.548 --> 07:34:00.558 align:start position:0%
in the chemicals were in the molotov
 
07:34:01.910 --> 07:34:01.920 align:start position:0%
cocktails or what have you in some of
 
07:34:04.708 --> 07:34:04.718 align:start position:0%
these attacks keying up cars attacking
 
07:34:06.868 --> 07:34:06.878 align:start position:0%
vehicles ripping the you know rear view
 
07:34:09.830 --> 07:34:09.840 align:start position:0%
mirror off things like that um
 
07:34:12.468 --> 07:34:12.478 align:start position:0%
in in that type of emergency we're only
 
07:34:14.628 --> 07:34:14.638 align:start position:0%
looking at the driver we're only looking
 
07:34:17.110 --> 07:34:17.120 align:start position:0%
at the what we call the actor this is
 
07:34:18.548 --> 07:34:18.558 align:start position:0%
the person who is
 
07:34:20.788 --> 07:34:20.798 align:start position:0%
not attempting to harm others but they
 
07:34:22.708 --> 07:34:22.718 align:start position:0%
are simply trying to survive and protect
 
07:34:23.990 --> 07:34:24.000 align:start position:0%
their own family
 
07:34:27.110 --> 07:34:27.120 align:start position:0%
uh an actor or a reactor is someone who
 
07:34:30.070 --> 07:34:30.080 align:start position:0%
is reacting to an attack that happens
 
07:34:31.750 --> 07:34:31.760 align:start position:0%
that they didn't cause they didn't bring
 
07:34:33.750 --> 07:34:33.760 align:start position:0%
about the attack they're reacting to an
 
07:34:35.990 --> 07:34:36.000 align:start position:0%
attack on their person or on their
 
07:34:36.000 --> 07:34:37.110 align:start position:0%
attack on their person or on their
family

07:34:37.110 --> 07:34:37.120 align:start position:0%
family
 
07:34:37.120 --> 07:34:38.388 align:start position:0%
family
so

07:34:38.388 --> 07:34:38.398 align:start position:0%
so
 
07:34:40.628 --> 07:34:40.638 align:start position:0%
there's another defense 627 section
 
07:34:42.388 --> 07:34:42.398 align:start position:0%
three which is competing harms which
 
07:34:44.310 --> 07:34:44.320 align:start position:0%
says if you have say three or four
 
07:34:46.788 --> 07:34:46.798 align:start position:0%
people in the vehicle
 
07:34:48.548 --> 07:34:48.558 align:start position:0%
that's a different defense
 
07:34:50.070 --> 07:34:50.080 align:start position:0%
that you can raise
 
07:34:52.788 --> 07:34:52.798 align:start position:0%
um if there are more people in the car
 
07:34:54.708 --> 07:34:54.718 align:start position:0%
and you have to drive away
 
07:34:56.468 --> 07:34:56.478 align:start position:0%
um or if you had to drive drunk to
 
07:34:58.070 --> 07:34:58.080 align:start position:0%
escape a violent crowd or some such
 
07:34:59.350 --> 07:34:59.360 align:start position:0%
thing you're allowed to do that under
 
07:35:02.388 --> 07:35:02.398 align:start position:0%
competing harms um but i don't
 
07:35:02.398 --> 07:35:03.430 align:start position:0%
competing harms um but i don't
um

07:35:03.430 --> 07:35:03.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:35:05.270 --> 07:35:05.280 align:start position:0%
i think the understanding of the law of
 
07:35:07.030 --> 07:35:07.040 align:start position:0%
self-defense law has been for and i
 
07:35:08.948 --> 07:35:08.958 align:start position:0%
don't just mean for american history but
 
07:35:11.030 --> 07:35:11.040 align:start position:0%
for thousands of years if you're under
 
07:35:13.910 --> 07:35:13.920 align:start position:0%
attack the law steps back and allows you
 
07:35:18.388 --> 07:35:18.398 align:start position:0%
 
07:35:20.948 --> 07:35:20.958 align:start position:0%
to protect others moses killing the
 
07:35:23.910 --> 07:35:23.920 align:start position:0%
egyptian soldier in the old testament
 
07:35:25.830 --> 07:35:25.840 align:start position:0%
and so on that you've always had the
 
07:35:27.750 --> 07:35:27.760 align:start position:0%
right to defend yourself for others if
 
07:35:30.788 --> 07:35:30.798 align:start position:0%
you're under immediate immediate attack
 
07:35:32.948 --> 07:35:32.958 align:start position:0%
it's unfortunate if a bystander
 
07:35:32.958 --> 07:35:33.910 align:start position:0%
it's unfortunate if a bystander
gets

07:35:33.910 --> 07:35:33.920 align:start position:0%
gets
 
07:35:36.070 --> 07:35:36.080 align:start position:0%
hit but it's i've never seen a case
 
07:35:37.830 --> 07:35:37.840 align:start position:0%
where somebody jumps out in the road and
 
07:35:39.910 --> 07:35:39.920 align:start position:0%
attacks a vehicle or is in front of the
 
07:35:42.070 --> 07:35:42.080 align:start position:0%
vehicle and is just an innocent
 
07:35:44.150 --> 07:35:44.160 align:start position:0%
bystander it's only supposed to be cars
 
07:35:46.788 --> 07:35:46.798 align:start position:0%
 
07:35:50.388 --> 07:35:50.398 align:start position:0%
representative i may ask this to follow
 
07:35:52.388 --> 07:35:52.398 align:start position:0%
i think when it comes to
 
07:35:54.230 --> 07:35:54.240 align:start position:0%
the actual individuals that are engaging
 
07:35:56.548 --> 07:35:56.558 align:start position:0%
in the violent behavior
 
07:35:58.310 --> 07:35:58.320 align:start position:0%
that's that's not the concern i have
 
07:36:00.310 --> 07:36:00.320 align:start position:0%
it's but it my concern is in the
 
07:36:03.350 --> 07:36:03.360 align:start position:0%
definition of rioting is that multiples
 
07:36:03.360 --> 07:36:04.310 align:start position:0%
definition of rioting is that multiples
where

07:36:04.310 --> 07:36:04.320 align:start position:0%
where
 
07:36:05.990 --> 07:36:06.000 align:start position:0%
in that scenario
 
07:36:07.350 --> 07:36:07.360 align:start position:0%
that person
 
07:36:08.468 --> 07:36:08.478 align:start position:0%
may be
 
07:36:09.910 --> 07:36:09.920 align:start position:0%
engaging in conduct that is not
 
07:36:09.920 --> 07:36:11.190 align:start position:0%
engaging in conduct that is not
necessarily

07:36:11.190 --> 07:36:11.200 align:start position:0%
necessarily
 
07:36:13.430 --> 07:36:13.440 align:start position:0%
approved of but it's not violent
 
07:36:15.270 --> 07:36:15.280 align:start position:0%
but the person next to them
 
07:36:17.670 --> 07:36:17.680 align:start position:0%
becomes violent
 
07:36:19.430 --> 07:36:19.440 align:start position:0%
i'm worried about the tumultuous person
 
07:36:21.110 --> 07:36:21.120 align:start position:0%
who despite
 
07:36:22.788 --> 07:36:22.798 align:start position:0%
what they're doing they're not engaging
 
07:36:24.150 --> 07:36:24.160 align:start position:0%
in violence
 
07:36:26.070 --> 07:36:26.080 align:start position:0%
or committing bringing any unlawful
 
07:36:27.750 --> 07:36:27.760 align:start position:0%
force against the person in the vehicle
 
07:36:30.388 --> 07:36:30.398 align:start position:0%
that's what i'm concerned with so
 
07:36:30.398 --> 07:36:31.670 align:start position:0%
that's what i'm concerned with so
perhaps

07:36:31.670 --> 07:36:31.680 align:start position:0%
perhaps
 
07:36:33.190 --> 07:36:33.200 align:start position:0%
what is your opinion on an amendment
 
07:36:34.788 --> 07:36:34.798 align:start position:0%
that would maybe
 
07:36:36.468 --> 07:36:36.478 align:start position:0%
the purpose of rioting you would exclude
 
07:36:36.478 --> 07:36:38.070 align:start position:0%
the purpose of rioting you would exclude
tumultuous

07:36:38.070 --> 07:36:38.080 align:start position:0%
tumultuous
 
07:36:38.080 --> 07:36:38.948 align:start position:0%
tumultuous
um

07:36:38.948 --> 07:36:38.958 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:36:40.388 --> 07:36:40.398 align:start position:0%
well as i mentioned earlier i would
 
07:36:41.990 --> 07:36:42.000 align:start position:0%
simply strike out
 
07:36:43.430 --> 07:36:43.440 align:start position:0%
because i'm really not sure that it's
 
07:36:46.388 --> 07:36:46.398 align:start position:0%
necessary strikeout proposed part e
 
07:36:47.670 --> 07:36:47.680 align:start position:0%
because i think that the additional
 
07:36:50.230 --> 07:36:50.240 align:start position:0%
wording in part d is sufficient to
 
07:36:51.590 --> 07:36:51.600 align:start position:0%
accomplish what the prime sponsor is
 
07:36:52.868 --> 07:36:52.878 align:start position:0%
trying to do so that would avoid the
 
07:36:52.878 --> 07:36:54.070 align:start position:0%
trying to do so that would avoid the
problem

07:36:54.070 --> 07:36:54.080 align:start position:0%
problem
 
07:36:55.990 --> 07:36:56.000 align:start position:0%
rioting in new hampshire
 
07:36:58.070 --> 07:36:58.080 align:start position:0%
is two or more people engaged in the
 
07:37:00.150 --> 07:37:00.160 align:start position:0%
concerted attack
 
07:37:00.160 --> 07:37:01.110 align:start position:0%
concerted attack
and

07:37:01.110 --> 07:37:01.120 align:start position:0%
and
 
07:37:03.590 --> 07:37:03.600 align:start position:0%
as it's used in this proposed
 
07:37:06.388 --> 07:37:06.398 align:start position:0%
statute in this bill
 
07:37:08.708 --> 07:37:08.718 align:start position:0%
that use of the word right is further
 
07:37:10.948 --> 07:37:10.958 align:start position:0%
narrowed as right against a person in a
 
07:37:13.510 --> 07:37:13.520 align:start position:0%
vehicle demanding its privilege and in
 
07:37:15.750 --> 07:37:15.760 align:start position:0%
in this one it says is likely to use any
 
07:37:17.190 --> 07:37:17.200 align:start position:0%
unlawful force in the commission of a
 
07:37:18.628 --> 07:37:18.638 align:start position:0%
riot against a person in a vehicle
 
07:37:20.388 --> 07:37:20.398 align:start position:0%
dwelling or its privilege so it's even
 
07:37:22.708 --> 07:37:22.718 align:start position:0%
further narrowed to just a group of
 
07:37:25.350 --> 07:37:25.360 align:start position:0%
people two or more attacking the vehicle
 
07:37:27.030 --> 07:37:27.040 align:start position:0%
dwelling or the people in the dwelling
 
07:37:28.230 --> 07:37:28.240 align:start position:0%
or cartilage
 
07:37:31.270 --> 07:37:31.280 align:start position:0%
it's not any riot that occurs it's only
 
07:37:42.388 --> 07:37:42.398 align:start position:0%
 
07:37:46.150 --> 07:37:46.160 align:start position:0%
thank you representative everson for
 
07:37:46.160 --> 07:37:47.350 align:start position:0%
thank you representative everson for
um

07:37:47.350 --> 07:37:47.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:37:49.670 --> 07:37:49.680 align:start position:0%
you seem to be a well-read person
 
07:37:52.788 --> 07:37:52.798 align:start position:0%
especially in law
 
07:37:55.110 --> 07:37:55.120 align:start position:0%
can you define what i know what the
 
07:37:57.910 --> 07:37:57.920 align:start position:0%
definition of deadly force is but i
 
07:38:01.590 --> 07:38:01.600 align:start position:0%
don't know the definition of what uh un
 
07:38:04.628 --> 07:38:04.638 align:start position:0%
unlawful force is can you provide me
 
07:38:06.708 --> 07:38:06.718 align:start position:0%
with a definition
 
07:38:09.110 --> 07:38:09.120 align:start position:0%
uh it's not explicitly defined but in
 
07:38:12.230 --> 07:38:12.240 align:start position:0%
rsa 627 force includes both deadly force
 
07:38:15.190 --> 07:38:15.200 align:start position:0%
and non-deadly force so you could have
 
07:38:17.430 --> 07:38:17.440 align:start position:0%
uh somebody while you're in your vehicle
 
07:38:20.468 --> 07:38:20.478 align:start position:0%
with your family um once they've
 
07:38:23.190 --> 07:38:23.200 align:start position:0%
started sorry my cats
 
07:38:25.110 --> 07:38:25.120 align:start position:0%
decided to take
 
07:38:28.948 --> 07:38:28.958 align:start position:0%
 
07:38:30.628 --> 07:38:30.638 align:start position:0%
there isn't an explicit definition but
 
07:38:33.910 --> 07:38:33.920 align:start position:0%
it could be any type of attack on you
 
07:38:36.070 --> 07:38:36.080 align:start position:0%
or a family member under this bill in
 
07:38:37.510 --> 07:38:37.520 align:start position:0%
the vehicle
 
07:38:43.830 --> 07:38:43.840 align:start position:0%
 
07:38:49.430 --> 07:38:49.440 align:start position:0%
 
07:38:51.030 --> 07:38:51.040 align:start position:0%
representing representative
 
07:38:55.510 --> 07:38:55.520 align:start position:0%
 
07:38:55.520 --> 07:38:57.110 align:start position:0%
 
so

07:38:57.110 --> 07:38:57.120 align:start position:0%
so
 
07:38:57.120 --> 07:38:58.468 align:start position:0%
so
illegal

07:38:58.468 --> 07:38:58.478 align:start position:0%
illegal
 
07:39:00.548 --> 07:39:00.558 align:start position:0%
unlawful of course if you're in your
 
07:39:03.670 --> 07:39:03.680 align:start position:0%
vehicle for example and uh uh two or
 
07:39:05.830 --> 07:39:05.840 align:start position:0%
more people came up and broke off the
 
07:39:07.910 --> 07:39:07.920 align:start position:0%
hood ornament would that not be illegal
 
07:39:11.350 --> 07:39:11.360 align:start position:0%
force and uh does this law didn't give
 
07:39:14.388 --> 07:39:14.398 align:start position:0%
you opportunity to use deadly force
 
07:39:16.070 --> 07:39:16.080 align:start position:0%
no it doesn't because under the bill it
 
07:39:18.230 --> 07:39:18.240 align:start position:0%
would have to be unlawful force against
 
07:39:21.670 --> 07:39:21.680 align:start position:0%
a person as it's not unlawful force
 
07:39:23.830 --> 07:39:23.840 align:start position:0%
just against the hood ornament it's part
 
07:39:25.510 --> 07:39:25.520 align:start position:0%
of a concerted attack
 
07:39:27.270 --> 07:39:27.280 align:start position:0%
uh where it's likely that
 
07:39:29.110 --> 07:39:29.120 align:start position:0%
they're you know the group has become so
 
07:39:31.350 --> 07:39:31.360 align:start position:0%
violent we understand the uh
 
07:39:33.110 --> 07:39:33.120 align:start position:0%
um better the
 
07:39:35.110 --> 07:39:35.120 align:start position:0%
the group think that's involved in mob
 
07:39:35.120 --> 07:39:36.310 align:start position:0%
the group think that's involved in mob
violence

07:39:36.310 --> 07:39:36.320 align:start position:0%
violence
 
07:39:38.230 --> 07:39:38.240 align:start position:0%
and so i think what the sponsor is going
 
07:39:41.270 --> 07:39:41.280 align:start position:0%
after is once you have an angry mob or a
 
07:39:42.388 --> 07:39:42.398 align:start position:0%
violent mob
 
07:39:44.388 --> 07:39:44.398 align:start position:0%
that once the violence starts when
 
07:39:46.070 --> 07:39:46.080 align:start position:0%
they're part of a mob when they're part
 
07:39:47.910 --> 07:39:47.920 align:start position:0%
of a group of people if they feel like
 
07:39:49.830 --> 07:39:49.840 align:start position:0%
other people are escalating the violence
 
07:39:52.230 --> 07:39:52.240 align:start position:0%
that there's a kind of competition to
 
07:39:54.548 --> 07:39:54.558 align:start position:0%
escalate that very very quickly and if
 
07:39:57.670 --> 07:39:57.680 align:start position:0%
you don't drive off at that time uh
 
07:39:59.830 --> 07:39:59.840 align:start position:0%
you're in much much greater danger of
 
07:40:01.670 --> 07:40:01.680 align:start position:0%
being attacked
 
07:40:01.680 --> 07:40:02.628 align:start position:0%
being attacked
um

07:40:02.628 --> 07:40:02.638 align:start position:0%

07:40:04.548 --> 07:40:04.558 align:start position:0%
or possibly dragged out of the vehicle
 
07:40:05.510 --> 07:40:05.520 align:start position:0%

07:40:18.388 --> 07:40:18.398 align:start position:0%

thank you
 
07:40:34.468 --> 07:40:34.478 align:start position:0%
 
07:40:44.070 --> 07:40:44.080 align:start position:0%
 
07:40:45.830 --> 07:40:45.840 align:start position:0%
hello can you hear me
 
07:40:50.948 --> 07:40:50.958 align:start position:0%
 
07:40:53.670 --> 07:40:53.680 align:start position:0%
yes yes we can um you okay cool so my
 
07:40:55.350 --> 07:40:55.360 align:start position:0%
name is ismael mini i'm speaking
 
07:40:57.430 --> 07:40:57.440 align:start position:0%
strongly against this bill
 
07:40:59.990 --> 07:41:00.000 align:start position:0%
um first i want to say that this is not
 
07:41:02.468 --> 07:41:02.478 align:start position:0%
about gun rights so i wish we'd stop
 
07:41:04.070 --> 07:41:04.080 align:start position:0%
focusing on that
 
07:41:06.070 --> 07:41:06.080 align:start position:0%
i heard many people including lawyers
 
07:41:08.230 --> 07:41:08.240 align:start position:0%
who know how to use legalese to try to
 
07:41:09.430 --> 07:41:09.440 align:start position:0%
convince us
 
07:41:11.510 --> 07:41:11.520 align:start position:0%
that you know it's okay to kill people
 
07:41:14.070 --> 07:41:14.080 align:start position:0%
and get away with it um several things
 
07:41:16.468 --> 07:41:16.478 align:start position:0%
john roman a senior fellow at the urban
 
07:41:18.788 --> 07:41:18.798 align:start position:0%
institute justice policy center recently
 
07:41:20.868 --> 07:41:20.878 align:start position:0%
conducted a study examining racial
 
07:41:24.310 --> 07:41:24.320 align:start position:0%
disparity using fbi data and roman found
 
07:41:26.150 --> 07:41:26.160 align:start position:0%
that the killings of black people by
 
07:41:28.708 --> 07:41:28.718 align:start position:0%
whites are more likely to be considered
 
07:41:30.948 --> 07:41:30.958 align:start position:0%
justified than the killings of white
 
07:41:32.868 --> 07:41:32.878 align:start position:0%
people by blacks
 
07:41:35.110 --> 07:41:35.120 align:start position:0%
second i am a sexual and domestic
 
07:41:37.590 --> 07:41:37.600 align:start position:0%
violence advocate and i am appalled that
 
07:41:39.990 --> 07:41:40.000 align:start position:0%
the lawyer uses women's rights to
 
07:41:42.708 --> 07:41:42.718 align:start position:0%
promote violence when we're fighting
 
07:41:45.030 --> 07:41:45.040 align:start position:0%
violence in all its forms so hearing
 
07:41:48.150 --> 07:41:48.160 align:start position:0%
this lawyer use her skills of language
 
07:41:50.708 --> 07:41:50.718 align:start position:0%
was quite disheartening also i've been
 
07:41:53.270 --> 07:41:53.280 align:start position:0%
in many protests and i thought um if i
 
07:41:55.430 --> 07:41:55.440 align:start position:0%
knew that people are able to use this
 
07:41:58.070 --> 07:41:58.080 align:start position:0%
law to harm me because they can get away
 
07:42:00.310 --> 07:42:00.320 align:start position:0%
with it that's terrifying right so i
 
07:42:02.150 --> 07:42:02.160 align:start position:0%
hope you understand you have a duty to
 
07:42:04.548 --> 07:42:04.558 align:start position:0%
protect my constitutional right to
 
07:42:07.110 --> 07:42:07.120 align:start position:0%
safety and to protest again i'm aware
 
07:42:08.948 --> 07:42:08.958 align:start position:0%
that there's already stand your ground
 
07:42:11.510 --> 07:42:11.520 align:start position:0%
laws in place but we must defeat this
 
07:42:13.670 --> 07:42:13.680 align:start position:0%
bill that further extends the stand your
 
07:42:16.310 --> 07:42:16.320 align:start position:0%
ground and we must as a state return
 
07:42:18.628 --> 07:42:18.638 align:start position:0%
back to the castle doctrine eventually
 
07:42:20.468 --> 07:42:20.478 align:start position:0%
that would make it impossible for people
 
07:42:23.190 --> 07:42:23.200 align:start position:0%
to shoot now and think later and also
 
07:42:25.430 --> 07:42:25.440 align:start position:0%
wouldn't allow people based on racism to
 
07:42:28.150 --> 07:42:28.160 align:start position:0%
harm people and get away with it so
 
07:42:30.468 --> 07:42:30.478 align:start position:0%
please vote against this bill that will
 
07:42:36.150 --> 07:42:36.160 align:start position:0%
 
07:42:38.310 --> 07:42:38.320 align:start position:0%

07:42:55.030 --> 07:42:55.040 align:start position:0%
 
07:42:56.388 --> 07:42:56.398 align:start position:0%
we are
 
07:42:58.468 --> 07:42:58.478 align:start position:0%

i'm in favor of this bill
 
07:43:44.230 --> 07:43:44.240 align:start position:0%
we have heard way too many times of
 
07:43:44.240 --> 07:43:45.590 align:start position:0%
we have heard way too many times of
people

07:43:45.590 --> 07:43:45.600 align:start position:0%
people
 
07:43:48.388 --> 07:43:48.398 align:start position:0%
stopping other people on bridges you
 
07:43:50.708 --> 07:43:50.718 align:start position:0%
have no place to go they come they take
 
07:43:53.030 --> 07:43:53.040 align:start position:0%
you out of your car and they beat you or
 
07:43:55.990 --> 07:43:56.000 align:start position:0%
whatever you cannot let people do that
 
07:43:57.190 --> 07:43:57.200 align:start position:0%
to us
 
07:43:58.948 --> 07:43:58.958 align:start position:0%
we need the right to protect ourselves
 
07:44:00.948 --> 07:44:00.958 align:start position:0%
wherever we're at
 
07:44:03.430 --> 07:44:03.440 align:start position:0%
we have that right and i'm not saying we
 
07:44:05.830 --> 07:44:05.840 align:start position:0%
need to go and just do whatever to
 
07:44:08.548 --> 07:44:08.558 align:start position:0%
people protect yourself from being
 
07:44:11.830 --> 07:44:11.840 align:start position:0%
beaten or killed in your automobile and
 
07:44:13.910 --> 07:44:13.920 align:start position:0%
also i'd like to say i am one of those
 
07:44:15.990 --> 07:44:16.000 align:start position:0%
people for the statistic on feeling
 
07:44:16.000 --> 07:44:17.190 align:start position:0%
people for the statistic on feeling
unsafe

07:44:17.190 --> 07:44:17.200 align:start position:0%
unsafe
 
07:44:19.190 --> 07:44:19.200 align:start position:0%
they didn't have any statistics count me
 
07:44:22.468 --> 07:44:22.478 align:start position:0%
in i feel unsafe in my country in my my
 
07:44:25.590 --> 07:44:25.600 align:start position:0%
state right now because we have
 
07:44:28.548 --> 07:44:28.558 align:start position:0%
organizations that are calling us racist
 
07:44:30.868 --> 07:44:30.878 align:start position:0%
and they are beating us they are
 
07:44:34.230 --> 07:44:34.240 align:start position:0%
threatening us and they are trying to
 
07:44:37.350 --> 07:44:37.360 align:start position:0%
subdued us it's not correct
 
07:44:37.360 --> 07:44:38.708 align:start position:0%
subdued us it's not correct
um

07:44:38.708 --> 07:44:38.718 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:44:41.430 --> 07:44:41.440 align:start position:0%
hope i have a little bit more time
 
07:44:43.510 --> 07:44:43.520 align:start position:0%
and i'm happy that the state is being
 
07:44:46.070 --> 07:44:46.080 align:start position:0%
proactive on this because instead of
 
07:44:48.070 --> 07:44:48.080 align:start position:0%
hearing a representative or somebody a
 
07:44:49.750 --> 07:44:49.760 align:start position:0%
police officer or something say well i
 
07:44:51.110 --> 07:44:51.120 align:start position:0%
wish we would have taken care of this
 
07:44:53.190 --> 07:44:53.200 align:start position:0%
early it shouldn't have happened well
 
07:44:54.468 --> 07:44:54.478 align:start position:0%
hopefully it won't happen because we're
 
07:44:56.230 --> 07:44:56.240 align:start position:0%
proactive i'm glad to see the state is
 
07:44:56.240 --> 07:44:59.830 align:start position:0%
proactive i'm glad to see the state is
proactive

try and make this uh as quick as i can
 
07:46:01.590 --> 07:46:01.600 align:start position:0%
the entire group of bills that are under
 
07:46:04.310 --> 07:46:04.320 align:start position:0%
consideration today to expand the stand
 
07:46:06.070 --> 07:46:06.080 align:start position:0%
your ground law give the whole group
 
07:46:07.750 --> 07:46:07.760 align:start position:0%
gives me concern
 
07:46:10.868 --> 07:46:10.878 align:start position:0%
the bills just and the law justifies
 
07:46:13.510 --> 07:46:13.520 align:start position:0%
vigilantism and laws like these bills
 
07:46:15.190 --> 07:46:15.200 align:start position:0%
have been used again and again
 
07:46:17.590 --> 07:46:17.600 align:start position:0%
throughout the country to justify murder
 
07:46:19.590 --> 07:46:19.600 align:start position:0%
with particularly egregious racial
 
07:46:19.600 --> 07:46:20.628 align:start position:0%
with particularly egregious racial
impact

07:46:20.628 --> 07:46:20.638 align:start position:0%
impact
 
07:46:22.548 --> 07:46:22.558 align:start position:0%
they encourage people to act before
 
07:46:24.310 --> 07:46:24.320 align:start position:0%
thinking by giving them a ready-made
 
07:46:25.910 --> 07:46:25.920 align:start position:0%
excuse to invoke
 
07:46:28.230 --> 07:46:28.240 align:start position:0%
they don't have a place in a society
 
07:46:30.628 --> 07:46:30.638 align:start position:0%
that's based on community and individual
 
07:46:33.110 --> 07:46:33.120 align:start position:0%
responsibility um a lot of what i was
 
07:46:35.030 --> 07:46:35.040 align:start position:0%
going to say about 197 really has
 
07:46:36.948 --> 07:46:36.958 align:start position:0%
already been said so i'll just put a
 
07:46:39.190 --> 07:46:39.200 align:start position:0%
point on a few of the um
 
07:46:40.310 --> 07:46:40.320 align:start position:0%
a few of the things that have been
 
07:46:41.510 --> 07:46:41.520 align:start position:0%
talked about
 
07:46:44.708 --> 07:46:44.718 align:start position:0%
197 is frankly terrifying especially
 
07:46:44.718 --> 07:46:45.670 align:start position:0%
197 is frankly terrifying especially
from

07:46:45.670 --> 07:46:45.680 align:start position:0%
from
 
07:46:47.990 --> 07:46:48.000 align:start position:0%
the point of view of an organization
 
07:46:50.708 --> 07:46:50.718 align:start position:0%
a group that does what we do it takes a
 
07:46:52.948 --> 07:46:52.958 align:start position:0%
law with an already broad application
 
07:46:54.788 --> 07:46:54.798 align:start position:0%
and it expands it to situations where
 
07:46:56.788 --> 07:46:56.798 align:start position:0%
someone could potentially use deadly
 
07:46:56.798 --> 07:46:58.310 align:start position:0%
someone could potentially use deadly
force

07:46:58.310 --> 07:46:58.320 align:start position:0%
force
 
07:47:00.230 --> 07:47:00.240 align:start position:0%
where things might just be tense or
 
07:47:02.310 --> 07:47:02.320 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable but have no need to be
 
07:47:04.150 --> 07:47:04.160 align:start position:0%
deadly at all
 
07:47:05.590 --> 07:47:05.600 align:start position:0%
and just to talk about the
 
07:47:07.670 --> 07:47:07.680 align:start position:0%
demonstrations point one might recall
 
07:47:09.590 --> 07:47:09.600 align:start position:0%
and i'm sure people will all recall this
 
07:47:11.270 --> 07:47:11.280 align:start position:0%
the situation that took place this
 
07:47:13.590 --> 07:47:13.600 align:start position:0%
summer with the mccloskeys who had a
 
07:47:15.670 --> 07:47:15.680 align:start position:0%
peaceful demonstration going by their
 
07:47:19.110 --> 07:47:19.120 align:start position:0%
house but saw fit to step out in front
 
07:47:20.468 --> 07:47:20.478 align:start position:0%
of their house
 
07:47:22.548 --> 07:47:22.558 align:start position:0%
both of uh it was a couple
 
07:47:24.868 --> 07:47:24.878 align:start position:0%
both carrying firearms and point them at
 
07:47:27.510 --> 07:47:27.520 align:start position:0%
that peaceful crowd something that could
 
07:47:31.350 --> 07:47:31.360 align:start position:0%
easily have escalated and which would be
 
07:47:33.430 --> 07:47:33.440 align:start position:0%
all in all likelihood
 
07:47:34.708 --> 07:47:34.718 align:start position:0%
which would have
 
07:47:37.270 --> 07:47:37.280 align:start position:0%
this bill would have provided them with
 
07:47:40.310 --> 07:47:40.320 align:start position:0%
an excuse for their behavior that is
 
07:47:42.708 --> 07:47:42.718 align:start position:0%
something that's really threatening to
 
07:47:45.270 --> 07:47:45.280 align:start position:0%
people who are active
 
07:47:46.548 --> 07:47:46.558 align:start position:0%
ms burkett
 
07:47:48.628 --> 07:47:48.638 align:start position:0%
we have to limit testimony to uh two
 
07:47:51.270 --> 07:47:51.280 align:start position:0%
minutes uh per person so you don't mind
 
07:47:52.948 --> 07:47:52.958 align:start position:0%
just completing your testimony
 
07:48:00.340 --> 07:48:00.350 align:start position:0%
 
07:48:00.350 --> 07:48:04.150 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

07:48:04.150 --> 07:48:04.160 align:start position:0%
 
07:48:15.430 --> 07:48:15.440 align:start position:0%
 
07:48:15.440 --> 07:48:16.628 align:start position:0%
 
oh

07:48:16.628 --> 07:48:16.638 align:start position:0%
oh
 
07:48:18.070 --> 07:48:18.080 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i didn't realize you had muted
 
07:48:18.080 --> 07:48:18.868 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i didn't realize you had muted
me

07:48:18.868 --> 07:48:18.878 align:start position:0%
me
 
07:48:18.878 --> 07:48:20.548 align:start position:0%
me
sorry

07:48:20.548 --> 07:48:20.558 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
07:48:22.868 --> 07:48:22.878 align:start position:0%
last sentence was just members of my
 
07:48:25.110 --> 07:48:25.120 align:start position:0%
organization peacefully
 
07:48:27.350 --> 07:48:27.360 align:start position:0%
act and actively demonstrate on a
 
07:48:29.190 --> 07:48:29.200 align:start position:0%
regular basis and so i would ask you to
 
07:48:34.070 --> 07:48:34.080 align:start position:0%
 
07:48:38.948 --> 07:48:38.958 align:start position:0%
 
07:48:41.190 --> 07:48:41.200 align:start position:0%
seeing seeing no hands at the witness's
 
07:48:41.200 --> 07:48:59.190 align:start position:0%
seeing seeing no hands at the witness's
excuse

07:48:59.190 --> 07:48:59.200 align:start position:0%
 
07:49:01.350 --> 07:49:01.360 align:start position:0%
good afternoon chairman adas
 
07:49:04.388 --> 07:49:04.398 align:start position:0%
for the record j.r hall can you hear me
 
07:49:06.788 --> 07:49:06.798 align:start position:0%
yes we can hear you okay
 
07:49:08.708 --> 07:49:08.718 align:start position:0%
i am speaking on behalf of my self as
 
07:49:10.070 --> 07:49:10.080 align:start position:0%
well as the new hampshire firearms
 
07:49:13.030 --> 07:49:13.040 align:start position:0%
coalition we are in support of this bill
 
07:49:16.070 --> 07:49:16.080 align:start position:0%
um in particular section d has drafted
 
07:49:18.150 --> 07:49:18.160 align:start position:0%
and e with potentially small
 
07:49:18.160 --> 07:49:20.388 align:start position:0%
and e with potentially small
modifications

07:49:20.388 --> 07:49:20.398 align:start position:0%
modifications
 
07:49:22.468 --> 07:49:22.478 align:start position:0%
i think the important portion has been
 
07:49:24.628 --> 07:49:24.638 align:start position:0%
stated by some of those in opposition to
 
07:49:26.948 --> 07:49:26.958 align:start position:0%
this bill several times during the
 
07:49:28.948 --> 07:49:28.958 align:start position:0%
the preceding hearing
 
07:49:30.310 --> 07:49:30.320 align:start position:0%
they've mentioned on a number of
 
07:49:31.750 --> 07:49:31.760 align:start position:0%
occasions that new hampshire is the
 
07:49:34.150 --> 07:49:34.160 align:start position:0%
third safest state in the nation
 
07:49:36.070 --> 07:49:36.080 align:start position:0%
actually i think if i look at the latest
 
07:49:38.230 --> 07:49:38.240 align:start position:0%
fbi data we're actually now number two
 
07:49:40.468 --> 07:49:40.478 align:start position:0%
not number three
 
07:49:41.830 --> 07:49:41.840 align:start position:0%
but i don't know that it matters whether
 
07:49:43.590 --> 07:49:43.600 align:start position:0%
we're number two or number three the
 
07:49:45.750 --> 07:49:45.760 align:start position:0%
reality is new hampshire is much safer
 
07:49:47.750 --> 07:49:47.760 align:start position:0%
than states where they have the laws
 
07:49:50.150 --> 07:49:50.160 align:start position:0%
that they're advocating for chicago for
 
07:49:52.628 --> 07:49:52.638 align:start position:0%
instance which as of today has had 54
 
07:49:52.638 --> 07:49:53.750 align:start position:0%
instance which as of today has had 54
murders

07:49:53.750 --> 07:49:53.760 align:start position:0%
murders
 
07:49:55.750 --> 07:49:55.760 align:start position:0%
a population roughly twice the size of
 
07:49:57.590 --> 07:49:57.600 align:start position:0%
us and they've had 54 murders in the
 
07:49:57.600 --> 07:49:58.468 align:start position:0%
us and they've had 54 murders in the
last

07:49:58.468 --> 07:49:58.478 align:start position:0%
last
 
07:50:00.310 --> 07:50:00.320 align:start position:0%
whatever 30 some days
 
07:50:01.830 --> 07:50:01.840 align:start position:0%
new hampshire doesn't see that level of
 
07:50:03.510 --> 07:50:03.520 align:start position:0%
crime because people are allowed to
 
07:50:05.110 --> 07:50:05.120 align:start position:0%
defend themselves
 
07:50:07.430 --> 07:50:07.440 align:start position:0%
and the mere fact that people can
 
07:50:10.310 --> 07:50:10.320 align:start position:0%
protect themselves is a huge deterrent
 
07:50:12.708 --> 07:50:12.718 align:start position:0%
and i i can't emphasize that enough it's
 
07:50:14.948 --> 07:50:14.958 align:start position:0%
an enormous deterrent to crime which is
 
07:50:17.030 --> 07:50:17.040 align:start position:0%
why new hampshire is so safe
 
07:50:18.708 --> 07:50:18.718 align:start position:0%
so i would ask that this committee
 
07:50:19.990 --> 07:50:20.000 align:start position:0%
passed the bill
 
07:50:20.000 --> 07:50:20.788 align:start position:0%
passed the bill
um

07:50:20.788 --> 07:50:20.798 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:50:23.590 --> 07:50:23.600 align:start position:0%
section d is is an important change and
 
07:50:26.628 --> 07:50:26.638 align:start position:0%
i want to testify as a dad one of the
 
07:50:28.788 --> 07:50:28.798 align:start position:0%
things that is not covered currently is
 
07:50:30.468 --> 07:50:30.478 align:start position:0%
what happens about a kidnapping which is
 
07:50:33.190 --> 07:50:33.200 align:start position:0%
clearly a felony level crime if i'm
 
07:50:35.990 --> 07:50:36.000 align:start position:0%
strapped into the front seat of my car
 
07:50:37.590 --> 07:50:37.600 align:start position:0%
and maybe we're in a parking lot but for
 
07:50:39.430 --> 07:50:39.440 align:start position:0%
some reason my kids have unstrapped
 
07:50:41.510 --> 07:50:41.520 align:start position:0%
themselves and someone opens the door
 
07:50:43.590 --> 07:50:43.600 align:start position:0%
and grabs them that's a real issue and
 
07:50:45.990 --> 07:50:46.000 align:start position:0%
we should be allowed to protect
 
07:50:47.910 --> 07:50:47.920 align:start position:0%
our families so i would ask that this
 
07:50:49.670 --> 07:50:49.680 align:start position:0%
committee passed the bill as filed thank
 
07:50:49.680 --> 07:50:59.110 align:start position:0%
committee passed the bill as filed thank
you

07:50:59.110 --> 07:50:59.120 align:start position:0%
 
07:51:01.430 --> 07:51:01.440 align:start position:0%
seeing no hands raised
 
07:51:03.110 --> 07:51:03.120 align:start position:0%
the witnesses excuse i want to thank
 
07:51:05.430 --> 07:51:05.440 align:start position:0%
excuse me
 
07:51:07.670 --> 07:51:07.680 align:start position:0%
representative burt
 
07:51:10.230 --> 07:51:10.240 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you uh
 
07:51:12.948 --> 07:51:12.958 align:start position:0%
former representative for
 
07:51:15.350 --> 07:51:15.360 align:start position:0%
you know speaking today
 
07:51:15.360 --> 07:51:17.350 align:start position:0%
you know speaking today
um

07:51:17.350 --> 07:51:17.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:51:19.670 --> 07:51:19.680 align:start position:0%
i've heard
 
07:51:22.388 --> 07:51:22.398 align:start position:0%
testimony from other people or one
 
07:51:24.868 --> 07:51:24.878 align:start position:0%
person that's talked about those people
 
07:51:26.388 --> 07:51:26.398 align:start position:0%
you know the husband and wife that stood
 
07:51:29.910 --> 07:51:29.920 align:start position:0%
in front of their house with the guns
 
07:51:33.430 --> 07:51:33.440 align:start position:0%
and that they were going to be charged
 
07:51:35.750 --> 07:51:35.760 align:start position:0%
with a crime
 
07:51:35.760 --> 07:51:36.868 align:start position:0%
with a crime
until

07:51:36.868 --> 07:51:36.878 align:start position:0%
until
 
07:51:36.878 --> 07:51:37.670 align:start position:0%
until
the

07:51:37.670 --> 07:51:37.680 align:start position:0%
the
 
07:51:39.750 --> 07:51:39.760 align:start position:0%
state attorney general stepped in and
 
07:51:42.070 --> 07:51:42.080 align:start position:0%
said no no no
 
07:51:44.468 --> 07:51:44.478 align:start position:0%
could you elaborate on that because i
 
07:51:46.150 --> 07:51:46.160 align:start position:0%
believe they the
 
07:51:48.150 --> 07:51:48.160 align:start position:0%
peaceful protesters were on their
 
07:51:50.468 --> 07:51:50.478 align:start position:0%
property ripping stuff down like gates
 
07:51:53.030 --> 07:51:53.040 align:start position:0%
and threatening etc
 
07:51:54.230 --> 07:51:54.240 align:start position:0%
you know so i was just wondering if you
 
07:51:56.628 --> 07:51:56.638 align:start position:0%
could elaborate on that
 
07:51:57.910 --> 07:51:57.920 align:start position:0%
thank you representative burke it's a
 
07:52:00.070 --> 07:52:00.080 align:start position:0%
great question um the couple was in fact
 
07:52:02.788 --> 07:52:02.798 align:start position:0%
charged initially um with a crime
 
07:52:05.030 --> 07:52:05.040 align:start position:0%
ironically of all this
 
07:52:05.040 --> 07:52:05.910 align:start position:0%
ironically of all this
the

07:52:05.910 --> 07:52:05.920 align:start position:0%
the
 
07:52:07.910 --> 07:52:07.920 align:start position:0%
um handgun that the lady had was a
 
07:52:09.990 --> 07:52:10.000 align:start position:0%
disabled replica or
 
07:52:12.150 --> 07:52:12.160 align:start position:0%
model that was used in a prior court
 
07:52:12.160 --> 07:52:13.030 align:start position:0%
model that was used in a prior court
case

07:52:13.030 --> 07:52:13.040 align:start position:0%
case
 
07:52:15.430 --> 07:52:15.440 align:start position:0%
as i understood it
 
07:52:17.510 --> 07:52:17.520 align:start position:0%
and they were trying to keep people away
 
07:52:19.430 --> 07:52:19.440 align:start position:0%
from their property where they had
 
07:52:20.948 --> 07:52:20.958 align:start position:0%
already broken in
 
07:52:24.948 --> 07:52:24.958 align:start position:0%
 
07:52:26.468 --> 07:52:26.478 align:start position:0%
cartilage i think is the proper legal
 
07:52:27.910 --> 07:52:27.920 align:start position:0%
term right we're on their grounds
 
07:52:30.230 --> 07:52:30.240 align:start position:0%
already in a threatening way
 
07:52:30.240 --> 07:52:31.430 align:start position:0%
already in a threatening way
now

07:52:31.430 --> 07:52:31.440 align:start position:0%
now
 
07:52:33.030 --> 07:52:33.040 align:start position:0%
we take away from this that was probably
 
07:52:34.548 --> 07:52:34.558 align:start position:0%
not the best thing in terms of trying to
 
07:52:37.270 --> 07:52:37.280 align:start position:0%
deter them but what we do know is no one
 
07:52:40.628 --> 07:52:40.638 align:start position:0%
got hurt and the hyperbole from
 
07:52:43.110 --> 07:52:43.120 align:start position:0%
those in opposition to this bill is the
 
07:52:45.110 --> 07:52:45.120 align:start position:0%
moment someone uses a firearm or he
 
07:52:46.868 --> 07:52:46.878 align:start position:0%
brings one out that someone's going to
 
07:52:49.190 --> 07:52:49.200 align:start position:0%
end up in the hospital or dead here's a
 
07:52:51.590 --> 07:52:51.600 align:start position:0%
good example where a couple right with
 
07:52:53.910 --> 07:52:53.920 align:start position:0%
firearms was able to prevent further
 
07:52:56.070 --> 07:52:56.080 align:start position:0%
escalation and i think we have great
 
07:52:58.788 --> 07:52:58.798 align:start position:0%
evidence in new hampshire that those our
 
07:53:01.190 --> 07:53:01.200 align:start position:0%
current um constitution carry law our
 
07:53:04.468 --> 07:53:04.478 align:start position:0%
current um statutes that exist have made
 
07:53:06.150 --> 07:53:06.160 align:start position:0%
us one of the safest states in the
 
07:53:06.160 --> 07:53:07.190 align:start position:0%
us one of the safest states in the
nation

07:53:07.190 --> 07:53:07.200 align:start position:0%
nation
 
07:53:10.230 --> 07:53:10.240 align:start position:0%
and as was pointed out by by several
 
07:53:12.230 --> 07:53:12.240 align:start position:0%
people opposed to this bill while new
 
07:53:14.948 --> 07:53:14.958 align:start position:0%
hampshire's the the third safest state
 
07:53:18.468 --> 07:53:18.478 align:start position:0%
we are and we are as a direct result of
 
07:53:20.628 --> 07:53:20.638 align:start position:0%
having good policies that allow people
 
07:53:22.468 --> 07:53:22.478 align:start position:0%
to protect themselves and i think it's
 
07:53:24.150 --> 07:53:24.160 align:start position:0%
something we should continue
 
07:53:25.830 --> 07:53:25.840 align:start position:0%
there was clearly an oversight in the
 
07:53:27.910 --> 07:53:27.920 align:start position:0%
law that doesn't allow you to protect
 
07:53:29.990 --> 07:53:30.000 align:start position:0%
from other level felonies
 
07:53:30.000 --> 07:53:30.788 align:start position:0%
from other level felonies
um

07:53:30.788 --> 07:53:30.798 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:53:32.548 --> 07:53:32.558 align:start position:0%
in the midst of a mob
 
07:53:34.388 --> 07:53:34.398 align:start position:0%
whether it's the term is riot mob we
 
07:53:36.468 --> 07:53:36.478 align:start position:0%
should figure that can be figured out
 
07:53:38.948 --> 07:53:38.958 align:start position:0%
but if your car is surrounded by people
 
07:53:40.868 --> 07:53:40.878 align:start position:0%
if you put it in drive and start driving
 
07:53:42.708 --> 07:53:42.718 align:start position:0%
away you'll be accused of manslaughter
 
07:53:44.868 --> 07:53:44.878 align:start position:0%
with a vehicle so that's no longer an
 
07:53:46.548 --> 07:53:46.558 align:start position:0%
option to protect
 
07:53:48.388 --> 07:53:48.398 align:start position:0%
the occupants of the car and i think we
 
07:53:50.150 --> 07:53:50.160 align:start position:0%
do need to allow for some level of
 
07:53:51.830 --> 07:53:51.840 align:start position:0%
protection especially if you're
 
07:53:54.230 --> 07:53:54.240 align:start position:0%
surrounded on all sides by
 
07:53:55.670 --> 07:53:55.680 align:start position:0%
by a mob
 
07:53:57.670 --> 07:53:57.680 align:start position:0%
so that's why the bill was put in and it
 
07:54:03.510 --> 07:54:03.520 align:start position:0%
 
07:54:06.948 --> 07:54:06.958 align:start position:0%
 
07:54:08.628 --> 07:54:08.638 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
07:54:12.548 --> 07:54:12.558 align:start position:0%
thank you uh mr hull for taking uh
 
07:54:14.070 --> 07:54:14.080 align:start position:0%
my question
 
07:54:15.990 --> 07:54:16.000 align:start position:0%
are you aware under
 
07:54:16.000 --> 07:54:16.788 align:start position:0%
are you aware under
uh

07:54:16.788 --> 07:54:16.798 align:start position:0%
uh
 
07:54:19.350 --> 07:54:19.360 align:start position:0%
uh under two paragraph c
 
07:54:22.830 --> 07:54:22.840 align:start position:0%
that deadly force is allowed to use
 
07:54:26.150 --> 07:54:26.160 align:start position:0%
if a person is committing or about to
 
07:54:28.230 --> 07:54:28.240 align:start position:0%
commit kidnapping or forcible sex
 
07:54:28.240 --> 07:54:30.788 align:start position:0%
commit kidnapping or forcible sex
offense

07:54:30.788 --> 07:54:30.798 align:start position:0%
 
07:54:33.430 --> 07:54:33.440 align:start position:0%
thank you um yes the the bill that i'm
 
07:54:34.868 --> 07:54:34.878 align:start position:0%
looking at is it does not have the
 
07:54:37.590 --> 07:54:37.600 align:start position:0%
entire section right um it only
 
07:54:40.708 --> 07:54:40.718 align:start position:0%
and i don't have 624 627 colon 4 in
 
07:54:42.070 --> 07:54:42.080 align:start position:0%
front of me
 
07:54:44.388 --> 07:54:44.398 align:start position:0%
i think the important part is
 
07:54:46.388 --> 07:54:46.398 align:start position:0%
the current list is
 
07:54:48.628 --> 07:54:48.638 align:start position:0%
abbreviated on what could be felonious
 
07:54:50.868 --> 07:54:50.878 align:start position:0%
level activity and and this is a
 
07:55:09.430 --> 07:55:09.440 align:start position:0%
 
07:55:11.030 --> 07:55:11.040 align:start position:0%
thank you mr
 
07:55:11.040 --> 07:55:12.150 align:start position:0%
thank you mr
um

07:55:12.150 --> 07:55:12.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:55:12.160 --> 07:55:13.350 align:start position:0%
um
so

07:55:13.350 --> 07:55:13.360 align:start position:0%
so
 
07:55:15.350 --> 07:55:15.360 align:start position:0%
i don't have a big problem about the
 
07:55:17.270 --> 07:55:17.280 align:start position:0%
rest of the
 
07:55:19.430 --> 07:55:19.440 align:start position:0%
areas in this paragraph and under column
 
07:55:20.388 --> 07:55:20.398 align:start position:0%
two but
 
07:55:20.398 --> 07:55:21.350 align:start position:0%
two but
this

07:55:21.350 --> 07:55:21.360 align:start position:0%
this
 
07:55:22.548 --> 07:55:22.558 align:start position:0%
this one
 
07:55:23.750 --> 07:55:23.760 align:start position:0%
and c
 
07:55:26.628 --> 07:55:26.638 align:start position:0%
uh uh extends the use of
 
07:55:27.990 --> 07:55:28.000 align:start position:0%
deadly force
 
07:55:30.548 --> 07:55:30.558 align:start position:0%
and now we're only talking about
 
07:55:32.628 --> 07:55:32.638 align:start position:0%
uh unlawful forms
 
07:55:34.788 --> 07:55:34.798 align:start position:0%
uh has not mentioned that
 
07:55:37.830 --> 07:55:37.840 align:start position:0%
there is deadly forces involved and
 
07:55:40.788 --> 07:55:40.798 align:start position:0%
it is quite an expansion of the
 
07:55:40.798 --> 07:55:44.948 align:start position:0%
it is quite an expansion of the
president

07:55:44.948 --> 07:55:44.958 align:start position:0%
 
07:55:48.468 --> 07:55:48.478 align:start position:0%
so let me just i brought up 6 27 4 right
 
07:55:50.468 --> 07:55:50.478 align:start position:0%
which is this is uh
 
07:55:53.270 --> 07:55:53.280 align:start position:0%
opponents of this of these statutes want
 
07:55:54.708 --> 07:55:54.718 align:start position:0%
to call it stand your ground but it
 
07:55:57.430 --> 07:55:57.440 align:start position:0%
really is a justification section in our
 
07:56:00.150 --> 07:56:00.160 align:start position:0%
statutes and i quote in this is roman
 
07:56:02.708 --> 07:56:02.718 align:start position:0%
numeral two a person is justified in
 
07:56:04.548 --> 07:56:04.558 align:start position:0%
using deadly force upon another person
 
07:56:06.468 --> 07:56:06.478 align:start position:0%
when he reasonably believes such person
 
07:56:08.310 --> 07:56:08.320 align:start position:0%
is and then there's a list
 
07:56:10.150 --> 07:56:10.160 align:start position:0%
right and
 
07:56:13.670 --> 07:56:13.680 align:start position:0%
item one is to use unlawful deadly force
 
07:56:13.680 --> 07:56:16.548 align:start position:0%
item one is to use unlawful deadly force
um

07:56:16.548 --> 07:56:16.558 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:56:16.558 --> 07:56:17.510 align:start position:0%
um
if

07:56:17.510 --> 07:56:17.520 align:start position:0%
if
 
07:56:19.750 --> 07:56:19.760 align:start position:0%
current section d just says unlawful
 
07:56:21.990 --> 07:56:22.000 align:start position:0%
force already right it's unlikely to use
 
07:56:23.590 --> 07:56:23.600 align:start position:0%
unlawful force in the commission of a
 
07:56:25.670 --> 07:56:25.680 align:start position:0%
felony against the actor
 
07:56:27.350 --> 07:56:27.360 align:start position:0%
the problem is what about the third
 
07:56:31.110 --> 07:56:31.120 align:start position:0%
party person in the car um
 
07:56:32.948 --> 07:56:32.958 align:start position:0%
and i think this was clearly an
 
07:56:35.110 --> 07:56:35.120 align:start position:0%
oversight when this statute was put in
 
07:56:37.270 --> 07:56:37.280 align:start position:0%
that it should be
 
07:56:39.270 --> 07:56:39.280 align:start position:0%
being able to protect themselves as well
 
07:56:40.788 --> 07:56:40.798 align:start position:0%
as another third party if they're trying
 
07:56:42.388 --> 07:56:42.398 align:start position:0%
to protect them i don't expect my
 
07:56:44.070 --> 07:56:44.080 align:start position:0%
children to be carrying firearms around
 
07:56:56.788 --> 07:56:56.798 align:start position:0%
 
07:56:58.708 --> 07:56:58.718 align:start position:0%
chairman abbas i think representative
 
07:57:00.868 --> 07:57:00.878 align:start position:0%
bernay renee wants to ask you another
 
07:57:00.878 --> 07:57:02.788 align:start position:0%
bernay renee wants to ask you another
question

07:57:02.788 --> 07:57:02.798 align:start position:0%
question
 
07:57:04.388 --> 07:57:04.398 align:start position:0%
representative ordnate
 
07:57:06.468 --> 07:57:06.478 align:start position:0%
do you recognize
 
07:57:06.478 --> 07:57:07.430 align:start position:0%
do you recognize
yes

07:57:07.430 --> 07:57:07.440 align:start position:0%
yes
 
07:57:07.440 --> 07:57:08.310 align:start position:0%
yes
um

07:57:08.310 --> 07:57:08.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:57:10.708 --> 07:57:10.718 align:start position:0%
but if you look in paragraph a under the
 
07:57:13.670 --> 07:57:13.680 align:start position:0%
same section
 
07:57:15.910 --> 07:57:15.920 align:start position:0%
is about to use unlawful
 
07:57:17.430 --> 07:57:17.440 align:start position:0%
deadly force
 
07:57:21.190 --> 07:57:21.200 align:start position:0%
against actor or third person so that
 
07:57:23.030 --> 07:57:23.040 align:start position:0%
their child would be covered under that
 
07:57:25.270 --> 07:57:25.280 align:start position:0%
third person would they not be
 
07:57:27.670 --> 07:57:27.680 align:start position:0%
correct i guess the question is right
 
07:57:30.788 --> 07:57:30.798 align:start position:0%
where in the line d unlawful force and
 
07:57:31.910 --> 07:57:31.920 align:start position:0%
and and
 
07:57:33.270 --> 07:57:33.280 align:start position:0%
i could think of
 
07:57:36.230 --> 07:57:36.240 align:start position:0%
potential felony level crimes that are
 
07:57:38.070 --> 07:57:38.080 align:start position:0%
not necessarily
 
07:57:38.080 --> 07:57:39.110 align:start position:0%
not necessarily
um

07:57:39.110 --> 07:57:39.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:57:41.270 --> 07:57:41.280 align:start position:0%
kidnapping or
 
07:57:44.310 --> 07:57:44.320 align:start position:0%
um the threat is with a firearm that
 
07:57:47.110 --> 07:57:47.120 align:start position:0%
 
07:57:48.230 --> 07:57:48.240 align:start position:0%
you've got to look at this through the
 
07:57:50.388 --> 07:57:50.398 align:start position:0%
eyes of a prosecutor the broken bottle
 
07:57:51.750 --> 07:57:51.760 align:start position:0%
well that just happened to be a broken
 
07:57:53.590 --> 07:57:53.600 align:start position:0%
bottle is very different a broken bottle
 
07:57:55.910 --> 07:57:55.920 align:start position:0%
can be a very dangerous weapon in if
 
07:58:01.030 --> 07:58:01.040 align:start position:0%
 
07:58:02.548 --> 07:58:02.558 align:start position:0%
representative ordnay
 
07:58:04.230 --> 07:58:04.240 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
07:58:04.240 --> 07:58:05.110 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
um

07:58:05.110 --> 07:58:05.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:58:07.510 --> 07:58:07.520 align:start position:0%
well i'll i would like to give you to
 
07:58:09.830 --> 07:58:09.840 align:start position:0%
give me uh actually thank you i want to
 
07:58:11.670 --> 07:58:11.680 align:start position:0%
actually ask you the same question i've
 
07:58:14.708 --> 07:58:14.718 align:start position:0%
asked who other uh
 
07:58:16.628 --> 07:58:16.638 align:start position:0%
and that is
 
07:58:18.150 --> 07:58:18.160 align:start position:0%
can you define
 
07:58:21.430 --> 07:58:21.440 align:start position:0%
 
07:58:24.070 --> 07:58:24.080 align:start position:0%
i am not sure that i can necessarily
 
07:58:26.788 --> 07:58:26.798 align:start position:0%
define unlawful force i believe
 
07:58:28.150 --> 07:58:28.160 align:start position:0%
and i would leave this up to the
 
07:58:29.910 --> 07:58:29.920 align:start position:0%
committee to take a look i believe there
 
07:58:31.830 --> 07:58:31.840 align:start position:0%
is some level of discussion in the
 
07:58:34.548 --> 07:58:34.558 align:start position:0%
statutes regarding
 
07:58:34.558 --> 07:58:35.830 align:start position:0%
statutes regarding
um

07:58:35.830 --> 07:58:35.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:58:38.708 --> 07:58:38.718 align:start position:0%
use of force use of lethal force
 
07:58:40.708 --> 07:58:40.718 align:start position:0%
and but
 
07:58:42.628 --> 07:58:42.638 align:start position:0%
um i i leave this up to the committee to
 
07:58:52.548 --> 07:58:52.558 align:start position:0%
 
07:58:54.628 --> 07:58:54.638 align:start position:0%
seeing no hands up
 
07:59:02.310 --> 07:59:02.320 align:start position:0%

08:00:11.670 --> 08:00:11.680 align:start position:0%
 
08:00:18.948 --> 08:00:18.958 align:start position:0%
 
08:00:21.750 --> 08:00:21.760 align:start position:0%
good afternoon mr chairman members of
 
08:00:23.430 --> 08:00:23.440 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
08:00:25.110 --> 08:00:25.120 align:start position:0%
i'll state for the record my name is
 
08:00:27.430 --> 08:00:27.440 align:start position:0%
alan rice and i am a resident of bedford
 
08:00:28.788 --> 08:00:28.798 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
08:00:31.190 --> 08:00:31.200 align:start position:0%
and i am here as the state director for
 
08:00:34.230 --> 08:00:34.240 align:start position:0%
gun owners of america and we are in
 
08:00:35.590 --> 08:00:35.600 align:start position:0%
support of
 
08:00:38.150 --> 08:00:38.160 align:start position:0%
house bill 197
 
08:00:41.110 --> 08:00:41.120 align:start position:0%
which is a relatively simple bill um i
 
08:00:42.868 --> 08:00:42.878 align:start position:0%
really am going to avoid repeating what
 
08:00:44.388 --> 08:00:44.398 align:start position:0%
others have said
 
08:00:45.990 --> 08:00:46.000 align:start position:0%
i just want to draw the committee's
 
08:00:47.910 --> 08:00:47.920 align:start position:0%
attention to
 
08:00:51.910 --> 08:00:51.920 align:start position:0%
the fact that riot is a specific crime
 
08:00:54.230 --> 08:00:54.240 align:start position:0%
it's defined by statute
 
08:00:56.948 --> 08:00:56.958 align:start position:0%
and in certain cases it is a violent
 
08:01:00.628 --> 08:01:00.638 align:start position:0%
felony a violent felony
 
08:01:02.230 --> 08:01:02.240 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire
 
08:01:04.468 --> 08:01:04.478 align:start position:0%
people have always had the right to use
 
08:01:04.478 --> 08:01:06.468 align:start position:0%
people have always had the right to use
force

08:01:06.468 --> 08:01:06.478 align:start position:0%
force
 
08:01:09.990 --> 08:01:10.000 align:start position:0%
against violent physical assault
 
08:01:12.310 --> 08:01:12.320 align:start position:0%
this just clarifies that if the physical
 
08:01:14.948 --> 08:01:14.958 align:start position:0%
assault takes place
 
08:01:18.070 --> 08:01:18.080 align:start position:0%
in a statutorily defined riot
 
08:01:20.948 --> 08:01:20.958 align:start position:0%
a person can also use
 
08:01:20.958 --> 08:01:23.030 align:start position:0%
a person can also use
force

08:01:23.030 --> 08:01:23.040 align:start position:0%
force
 
08:01:24.788 --> 08:01:24.798 align:start position:0%
the fir the first part of it in the
 
08:01:27.030 --> 08:01:27.040 align:start position:0%
vehicle as others have said if you're in
 
08:01:28.310 --> 08:01:28.320 align:start position:0%
your vehicle you're seated you're
 
08:01:28.320 --> 08:01:30.150 align:start position:0%
your vehicle you're seated you're
vulnerable

08:01:30.150 --> 08:01:30.160 align:start position:0%
vulnerable
 
08:01:32.628 --> 08:01:32.638 align:start position:0%
we saw a lot of bad things
 
08:01:35.510 --> 08:01:35.520 align:start position:0%
all over the country last year
 
08:01:37.750 --> 08:01:37.760 align:start position:0%
new hampshire was lucky that we didn't
 
08:01:39.750 --> 08:01:39.760 align:start position:0%
have those type of events and i think
 
08:01:43.430 --> 08:01:43.440 align:start position:0%
this is a proactive and preemptive bill
 
08:01:44.708 --> 08:01:44.718 align:start position:0%
to prevent
 
08:01:47.590 --> 08:01:47.600 align:start position:0%
new hampshire citizens or visitors
 
08:01:50.788 --> 08:01:50.798 align:start position:0%
from being victimized i'm happy to hear
 
08:01:52.468 --> 08:01:52.478 align:start position:0%
that the people on the other side who
 
08:01:55.270 --> 08:01:55.280 align:start position:0%
disagree with this bill acknowledge
 
08:01:57.030 --> 08:01:57.040 align:start position:0%
uh that new hampshire is a very safe
 
08:01:57.040 --> 08:01:58.070 align:start position:0%
uh that new hampshire is a very safe
state

08:01:58.070 --> 08:01:58.080 align:start position:0%
state
 
08:02:00.868 --> 08:02:00.878 align:start position:0%
and it's a safe state
 
08:02:03.110 --> 08:02:03.120 align:start position:0%
because we let people carry firearms for
 
08:02:06.948 --> 08:02:06.958 align:start position:0%
legitimate self-defense
 
08:02:08.868 --> 08:02:08.878 align:start position:0%
and that is a powerful deterrent and
 
08:02:11.830 --> 08:02:11.840 align:start position:0%
that's why we're a safe state
 
08:02:14.310 --> 08:02:14.320 align:start position:0%
with respect to the mccloskeys those
 
08:02:16.388 --> 08:02:16.398 align:start position:0%
people weren't just protesting it was a
 
08:02:19.510 --> 08:02:19.520 align:start position:0%
violent mob that knocked down a fence
 
08:02:21.750 --> 08:02:21.760 align:start position:0%
and was trespassing
 
08:02:23.830 --> 08:02:23.840 align:start position:0%
the beauty of it is is they defensively
 
08:02:27.270 --> 08:02:27.280 align:start position:0%
displayed some firearms and warded off
 
08:02:29.830 --> 08:02:29.840 align:start position:0%
physical harm and i think that's a good
 
08:02:32.468 --> 08:02:32.478 align:start position:0%
thing i would ask the committee to vote
 
08:02:34.548 --> 08:02:34.558 align:start position:0%
house bill 197
 
08:02:37.430 --> 08:02:37.440 align:start position:0%
ought to pass without any amendments and
 
08:02:42.468 --> 08:02:42.478 align:start position:0%
 
08:02:45.270 --> 08:02:45.280 align:start position:0%
representative calmly
 
08:02:46.948 --> 08:02:46.958 align:start position:0%
uh sir that was
 
08:02:53.350 --> 08:02:53.360 align:start position:0%
 
08:02:56.708 --> 08:02:56.718 align:start position:0%
 
08:02:59.190 --> 08:02:59.200 align:start position:0%
seeing no hands raised
 
08:03:01.190 --> 08:03:01.200 align:start position:0%
uh the witnesses is excused i want to
 
08:03:03.670 --> 08:03:03.680 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony
 
08:03:03.680 --> 08:03:11.350 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony
welcome

08:03:11.350 --> 08:03:11.360 align:start position:0%
 
08:03:13.430 --> 08:03:13.440 align:start position:0%
just to click just as let's make sure
 
08:03:14.788 --> 08:03:14.798 align:start position:0%
that any members of the public that are
 
08:03:16.468 --> 08:03:16.478 align:start position:0%
in the attendees
 
08:03:18.468 --> 08:03:18.478 align:start position:0%
that i wish to testify that haven't
 
08:03:26.628 --> 08:03:26.638 align:start position:0%
 
08:03:28.230 --> 08:03:28.240 align:start position:0%
look at this one
 
08:03:28.240 --> 08:03:39.510 align:start position:0%
look at this one
son

08:03:39.510 --> 08:03:39.520 align:start position:0%
 
08:03:41.350 --> 08:03:41.360 align:start position:0%
can you hear me
 
08:03:41.360 --> 08:03:42.388 align:start position:0%
can you hear me
yes

08:03:42.388 --> 08:03:42.398 align:start position:0%
yes
 
08:03:44.548 --> 08:03:44.558 align:start position:0%
hi thank you my name is andrew rice
 
08:03:46.388 --> 08:03:46.398 align:start position:0%
hawkins i'm the director of gun sense
 
08:03:48.310 --> 08:03:48.320 align:start position:0%
new hampshire a project of granite state
 
08:03:50.468 --> 08:03:50.478 align:start position:0%
progress i'm here today to testify in
 
08:03:52.868 --> 08:03:52.878 align:start position:0%
opposition to both house bill 145 and
 
08:03:56.388 --> 08:03:56.398 align:start position:0%
197 which expand the use of deadly force
 
08:03:58.150 --> 08:03:58.160 align:start position:0%
stand your ground laws otherwise known
 
08:03:59.830 --> 08:03:59.840 align:start position:0%
as kill it will do nothing more than
 
08:04:02.388 --> 08:04:02.398 align:start position:0%
justify murder as millions of americans
 
08:04:04.150 --> 08:04:04.160 align:start position:0%
demand solutions to violence and racial
 
08:04:06.948 --> 08:04:06.958 align:start position:0%
injustice these bills double down on the
 
08:04:09.510 --> 08:04:09.520 align:start position:0%
same white vigilantism that led to the
 
08:04:11.670 --> 08:04:11.680 align:start position:0%
murders of trayvon martin and ahmed
 
08:04:11.680 --> 08:04:12.868 align:start position:0%
murders of trayvon martin and ahmed
aubry

08:04:12.868 --> 08:04:12.878 align:start position:0%
aubry
 
08:04:14.310 --> 08:04:14.320 align:start position:0%
new hampshire already has a so-called
 
08:04:16.310 --> 08:04:16.320 align:start position:0%
stand-around law giving people a license
 
08:04:18.230 --> 08:04:18.240 align:start position:0%
to kill when confronted with a perceived
 
08:04:20.388 --> 08:04:20.398 align:start position:0%
threat without even considering walking
 
08:04:22.788 --> 08:04:22.798 align:start position:0%
away or de-escalating the situation
 
08:04:25.110 --> 08:04:25.120 align:start position:0%
house bill 145 completely removes the
 
08:04:27.030 --> 08:04:27.040 align:start position:0%
already narrow exceptions
 
08:04:28.628 --> 08:04:28.638 align:start position:0%
this would legally justify the use of
 
08:04:30.868 --> 08:04:30.878 align:start position:0%
deadly force in circumstances in which
 
08:04:33.030 --> 08:04:33.040 align:start position:0%
there's an opportunity to safely retreat
 
08:04:35.510 --> 08:04:35.520 align:start position:0%
where one can render property to a
 
08:04:37.350 --> 08:04:37.360 align:start position:0%
person claiming it's theirs or when a
 
08:04:39.510 --> 08:04:39.520 align:start position:0%
person's initial regression ingress and
 
08:04:42.468 --> 08:04:42.478 align:start position:0%
confrontation house bill 197 broadly
 
08:04:44.230 --> 08:04:44.240 align:start position:0%
expands where and when deadly force is
 
08:04:45.910 --> 08:04:45.920 align:start position:0%
permitted it could be used to justify
 
08:04:48.868 --> 08:04:48.878 align:start position:0%
shooting at protesters the phrase likely
 
08:04:51.110 --> 08:04:51.120 align:start position:0%
to use any lawful force is particularly
 
08:04:52.788 --> 08:04:52.798 align:start position:0%
egregious and basically leaves the
 
08:04:54.468 --> 08:04:54.478 align:start position:0%
entire decision of whether or not there
 
08:04:57.110 --> 08:04:57.120 align:start position:0%
is legal justification to shoot and kill
 
08:04:59.270 --> 08:04:59.280 align:start position:0%
someone up to how the shooter perceives
 
08:05:00.708 --> 08:05:00.718 align:start position:0%
things in the moment
 
08:05:02.628 --> 08:05:02.638 align:start position:0%
we absolutely cannot legalize the murder
 
08:05:04.788 --> 08:05:04.798 align:start position:0%
of people who pose quote perceived
 
08:05:07.830 --> 08:05:07.840 align:start position:0%
threats when systemic racism has
 
08:05:10.548 --> 08:05:10.558 align:start position:0%
weaponized blackness as a perceived
 
08:05:10.558 --> 08:05:11.430 align:start position:0%
weaponized blackness as a perceived
threat

08:05:11.430 --> 08:05:11.440 align:start position:0%
threat
 
08:05:13.030 --> 08:05:13.040 align:start position:0%
we all know what happens when states
 
08:05:15.110 --> 08:05:15.120 align:start position:0%
pass the underground laws people who
 
08:05:17.270 --> 08:05:17.280 align:start position:0%
look like mud aubry and trayvon martin
 
08:05:19.590 --> 08:05:19.600 align:start position:0%
are killed and murderers walk free
 
08:05:21.990 --> 08:05:22.000 align:start position:0%
house bill 197 also references lethal
 
08:05:24.468 --> 08:05:24.478 align:start position:0%
response against unlawful force which is
 
08:05:26.388 --> 08:05:26.398 align:start position:0%
the power or violence is directed
 
08:05:27.910 --> 08:05:27.920 align:start position:0%
against a person without that person's
 
08:05:30.548 --> 08:05:30.558 align:start position:0%
consent but it is not deadly force which
 
08:05:32.230 --> 08:05:32.240 align:start position:0%
is a separate definition
 
08:05:34.868 --> 08:05:34.878 align:start position:0%
again like house bill 81 earlier today
 
08:05:36.468 --> 08:05:36.478 align:start position:0%
these bills seek to expand the use of
 
08:05:37.948 --> 08:05:37.958 align:start position:0%
deadly force in response to
 
08:05:40.310 --> 08:05:40.320 align:start position:0%
non-life-threatening situations
 
08:05:42.948 --> 08:05:42.958 align:start position:0%
all they do is protect white vigilantes
 
08:05:45.030 --> 08:05:45.040 align:start position:0%
and embolden reckless gun owners to
 
08:05:46.948 --> 08:05:46.958 align:start position:0%
shoot first ask questions later and
 
08:05:49.990 --> 08:05:50.000 align:start position:0%
claim self-defense to avoid cocability
 
08:05:51.190 --> 08:05:51.200 align:start position:0%
for murder
 
08:05:52.628 --> 08:05:52.638 align:start position:0%
stand your ground bills are not about
 
08:05:55.670 --> 08:05:55.680 align:start position:0%
defense they are about legalizing murder
 
08:05:57.430 --> 08:05:57.440 align:start position:0%
one of the earlier testifiers said it
 
08:05:59.670 --> 08:05:59.680 align:start position:0%
best traditional self-defense does not
 
08:06:01.750 --> 08:06:01.760 align:start position:0%
require that a person retreat from a
 
08:06:03.510 --> 08:06:03.520 align:start position:0%
situation if doing so would put them in
 
08:06:05.830 --> 08:06:05.840 align:start position:0%
danger it only requires a person to
 
08:06:09.750 --> 08:06:09.760 align:start position:0%
 
08:06:11.750 --> 08:06:11.760 align:start position:0%
ms hawkins we do have to limit testimony
 
08:06:13.590 --> 08:06:13.600 align:start position:0%
to two minutes per person your time
 
08:06:14.788 --> 08:06:14.798 align:start position:0%
constraints so if you don't mind
 
08:06:16.868 --> 08:06:16.878 align:start position:0%
concluding your testimony
 
08:06:22.948 --> 08:06:22.958 align:start position:0%
 
08:06:24.310 --> 08:06:24.320 align:start position:0%
absolutely i'd encourage you to take a
 
08:06:26.388 --> 08:06:26.398 align:start position:0%
look at the original poster child for
 
08:06:28.548 --> 08:06:28.558 align:start position:0%
new hampshire's underground law who had
 
08:06:30.548 --> 08:06:30.558 align:start position:0%
brandished a firearm during a road rage
 
08:06:32.948 --> 08:06:32.958 align:start position:0%
incident years prior and who was
 
08:06:35.670 --> 08:06:35.680 align:start position:0%
arrested again in 2019 after shooting
 
08:06:37.510 --> 08:06:37.520 align:start position:0%
another man in front of his family in a
 
08:06:39.670 --> 08:06:39.680 align:start position:0%
similar road rage incident these are the
 
08:06:41.670 --> 08:06:41.680 align:start position:0%
types of people who want these laws on
 
08:06:43.750 --> 08:06:43.760 align:start position:0%
the books this was a person looking for
 
08:06:45.510 --> 08:06:45.520 align:start position:0%
an excuse in this legislature's
 
08:06:48.150 --> 08:06:48.160 align:start position:0%
permission to kill it will please do not
 
08:06:50.548 --> 08:06:50.558 align:start position:0%
pass these bills thank you
 
08:06:52.230 --> 08:06:52.240 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
08:06:54.150 --> 08:06:54.160 align:start position:0%
representative recognized to ask a
 
08:06:54.160 --> 08:06:56.388 align:start position:0%
representative recognized to ask a
question

08:06:56.388 --> 08:06:56.398 align:start position:0%
question
 
08:06:57.990 --> 08:06:58.000 align:start position:0%
thank you very much and thank you for
 
08:06:59.350 --> 08:06:59.360 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
08:07:01.030 --> 08:07:01.040 align:start position:0%
i i'm
 
08:07:02.708 --> 08:07:02.718 align:start position:0%
i understand you've been listening to
 
08:07:05.030 --> 08:07:05.040 align:start position:0%
the testimony throughout the afternoon
 
08:07:07.110 --> 08:07:07.120 align:start position:0%
uh and i'm curious
 
08:07:09.190 --> 08:07:09.200 align:start position:0%
if you've had the same reaction that i
 
08:07:10.468 --> 08:07:10.478 align:start position:0%
have where
 
08:07:11.990 --> 08:07:12.000 align:start position:0%
most of the
 
08:07:13.590 --> 08:07:13.600 align:start position:0%
most of the incidents that are being
 
08:07:16.070 --> 08:07:16.080 align:start position:0%
pointed out uh involve black lives
 
08:07:17.750 --> 08:07:17.760 align:start position:0%
matter protesters
 
08:07:17.760 --> 08:07:18.708 align:start position:0%
matter protesters
um

08:07:18.708 --> 08:07:18.718 align:start position:0%
um
 
08:07:22.230 --> 08:07:22.240 align:start position:0%
in a state that's 95 white
 
08:07:22.240 --> 08:07:23.270 align:start position:0%
in a state that's 95 white
um

08:07:23.270 --> 08:07:23.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
08:07:26.310 --> 08:07:26.320 align:start position:0%
i'm just curious uh
 
08:07:28.150 --> 08:07:28.160 align:start position:0%
if you think that they're what if you
 
08:07:30.230 --> 08:07:30.240 align:start position:0%
think that there is a
 
08:07:32.948 --> 08:07:32.958 align:start position:0%
a racial component to bills like this
 
08:07:34.628 --> 08:07:34.638 align:start position:0%
that we should be paying more attention
 
08:07:34.638 --> 08:07:36.150 align:start position:0%
that we should be paying more attention
to

08:07:36.150 --> 08:07:36.160 align:start position:0%
to
 
08:07:37.430 --> 08:07:37.440 align:start position:0%
absolutely and thank you for the
 
08:07:37.440 --> 08:07:38.310 align:start position:0%
absolutely and thank you for the
question

08:07:38.310 --> 08:07:38.320 align:start position:0%
question
 
08:07:40.388 --> 08:07:40.398 align:start position:0%
there is so much evidence about how
 
08:07:42.310 --> 08:07:42.320 align:start position:0%
stand your ground laws are
 
08:07:42.320 --> 08:07:44.150 align:start position:0%
stand your ground laws are
disproportionately

08:07:44.150 --> 08:07:44.160 align:start position:0%
disproportionately
 
08:07:46.388 --> 08:07:46.398 align:start position:0%
impacting and murdering black and brown
 
08:07:48.948 --> 08:07:48.958 align:start position:0%
people in our community and how
 
08:07:50.628 --> 08:07:50.638 align:start position:0%
white perpetrators are getting away with
 
08:07:53.190 --> 08:07:53.200 align:start position:0%
those murders now even in similar
 
08:07:55.510 --> 08:07:55.520 align:start position:0%
situations when the roles are reversed
 
08:07:58.548 --> 08:07:58.558 align:start position:0%
that is not the same outcome uh in
 
08:08:01.270 --> 08:08:01.280 align:start position:0%
in other cases we also know that these
 
08:08:04.628 --> 08:08:04.638 align:start position:0%
laws really allow folks who already have
 
08:08:08.468 --> 08:08:08.478 align:start position:0%
a disposition to be prejudiced to be uh
 
08:08:11.590 --> 08:08:11.600 align:start position:0%
to be racist in their orientation to
 
08:08:14.548 --> 08:08:14.558 align:start position:0%
use laws like this for what they would
 
08:08:16.468 --> 08:08:16.478 align:start position:0%
perceive as threats to murder other
 
08:08:16.478 --> 08:08:17.670 align:start position:0%
perceive as threats to murder other
people

08:08:17.670 --> 08:08:17.680 align:start position:0%
people
 
08:08:19.190 --> 08:08:19.200 align:start position:0%
and i would direct folks to look at
 
08:08:21.590 --> 08:08:21.600 align:start position:0%
southern poverty law center which has
 
08:08:23.590 --> 08:08:23.600 align:start position:0%
an a great video that they did with the
 
08:08:25.430 --> 08:08:25.440 align:start position:0%
giffords coalition that really talks
 
08:08:27.110 --> 08:08:27.120 align:start position:0%
about the application of these laws
 
08:08:28.468 --> 08:08:28.478 align:start position:0%
across other states and what the
 
08:08:30.628 --> 08:08:30.638 align:start position:0%
experience has been it is not an
 
08:08:41.750 --> 08:08:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
08:08:41.760 --> 08:08:42.868 align:start position:0%
 
um

08:08:42.868 --> 08:08:42.878 align:start position:0%
um
 
08:08:44.230 --> 08:08:44.240 align:start position:0%
something else that i'm interested in
 
08:08:46.548 --> 08:08:46.558 align:start position:0%
too and one of the possibilities that
 
08:08:49.030 --> 08:08:49.040 align:start position:0%
that bothers me too is i i have heard of
 
08:08:50.788 --> 08:08:50.798 align:start position:0%
incidents where
 
08:08:53.510 --> 08:08:53.520 align:start position:0%
in cases where laws like this have been
 
08:08:53.520 --> 08:08:55.510 align:start position:0%
in cases where laws like this have been
passed

08:08:55.510 --> 08:08:55.520 align:start position:0%
passed
 
08:08:55.520 --> 08:08:58.230 align:start position:0%
passed
where

08:08:58.230 --> 08:08:58.240 align:start position:0%
 
08:08:59.750 --> 08:08:59.760 align:start position:0%
people might
 
08:09:01.430 --> 08:09:01.440 align:start position:0%
you know might actually
 
08:09:04.150 --> 08:09:04.160 align:start position:0%
uh put themselves into a situation where
 
08:09:08.070 --> 08:09:08.080 align:start position:0%
they could cut confront um people during
 
08:09:10.948 --> 08:09:10.958 align:start position:0%
protests during peaceful protests and
 
08:09:13.910 --> 08:09:13.920 align:start position:0%
actually uh incite those people into a
 
08:09:16.388 --> 08:09:16.398 align:start position:0%
situation uh where they could basically
 
08:09:17.990 --> 08:09:18.000 align:start position:0%
go hunting
 
08:09:19.510 --> 08:09:19.520 align:start position:0%
is that something that you think this
 
08:09:22.548 --> 08:09:22.558 align:start position:0%
bill would open the door to
 
08:09:25.030 --> 08:09:25.040 align:start position:0%
i do and i think that the situations we
 
08:09:27.590 --> 08:09:27.600 align:start position:0%
had in new hampshire last summer um show
 
08:09:29.670 --> 08:09:29.680 align:start position:0%
that that is a very real possibility
 
08:09:31.030 --> 08:09:31.040 align:start position:0%
when you had
 
08:09:32.548 --> 08:09:32.558 align:start position:0%
particularly when we had black lives
 
08:09:32.558 --> 08:09:33.750 align:start position:0%
particularly when we had black lives
matter

08:09:33.750 --> 08:09:33.760 align:start position:0%
matter
 
08:09:36.230 --> 08:09:36.240 align:start position:0%
rallies and people calling out racial
 
08:09:39.350 --> 08:09:39.360 align:start position:0%
injustice and you had individuals
 
08:09:42.708 --> 08:09:42.718 align:start position:0%
lined across the street heavily armed
 
08:09:45.270 --> 08:09:45.280 align:start position:0%
and trying to generate conflict or when
 
08:09:47.670 --> 08:09:47.680 align:start position:0%
black lives matter manchester
 
08:09:49.590 --> 08:09:49.600 align:start position:0%
stopped and were talking to police
 
08:09:52.150 --> 08:09:52.160 align:start position:0%
officers during one of the first rallies
 
08:09:54.788 --> 08:09:54.798 align:start position:0%
they had in manchester and you had two
 
08:09:57.110 --> 08:09:57.120 align:start position:0%
individuals driving back and forth in
 
08:09:59.750 --> 08:09:59.760 align:start position:0%
their truck taunting yelling
 
08:10:01.590 --> 08:10:01.600 align:start position:0%
you know racial slurs and basically
 
08:10:04.150 --> 08:10:04.160 align:start position:0%
trying to provoke uh those in the crowd
 
08:10:06.230 --> 08:10:06.240 align:start position:0%
to engage with them um
 
08:10:08.948 --> 08:10:08.958 align:start position:0%
at which point they stopped their car
 
08:10:11.110 --> 08:10:11.120 align:start position:0%
and uh jumped out and pulled out weapons
 
08:10:12.948 --> 08:10:12.958 align:start position:0%
these are the types of situations that
 
08:10:14.868 --> 08:10:14.878 align:start position:0%
we do not want to give legal
 
08:10:16.948 --> 08:10:16.958 align:start position:0%
justification for there to be deadly
 
08:10:36.150 --> 08:10:36.160 align:start position:0%
 
08:10:38.070 --> 08:10:38.080 align:start position:0%
representative conley
 
08:10:39.910 --> 08:10:39.920 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you ms rice
 
08:10:41.910 --> 08:10:41.920 align:start position:0%
hawkins for taking the question
 
08:10:43.670 --> 08:10:43.680 align:start position:0%
uh one of the things i've been thinking
 
08:10:45.510 --> 08:10:45.520 align:start position:0%
about testimony unfolded is
 
08:10:45.520 --> 08:10:48.230 align:start position:0%
about testimony unfolded is
proportionality

08:10:48.230 --> 08:10:48.240 align:start position:0%
proportionality
 
08:10:50.628 --> 08:10:50.638 align:start position:0%
is it your understanding under this
 
08:10:52.230 --> 08:10:52.240 align:start position:0%
provision that
 
08:10:52.240 --> 08:10:54.070 align:start position:0%
provision that
perception

08:10:54.070 --> 08:10:54.080 align:start position:0%
perception
 
08:10:56.548 --> 08:10:56.558 align:start position:0%
of threat
 
08:10:59.270 --> 08:10:59.280 align:start position:0%
would allow for deadly
 
08:10:59.280 --> 08:11:01.590 align:start position:0%
would allow for deadly
response

08:11:01.590 --> 08:11:01.600 align:start position:0%
response
 
08:11:04.310 --> 08:11:04.320 align:start position:0%
so the feeling of concern would then
 
08:11:06.948 --> 08:11:06.958 align:start position:0%
justify deadly
 
08:11:06.958 --> 08:11:09.430 align:start position:0%
justify deadly
action

08:11:09.430 --> 08:11:09.440 align:start position:0%
 
08:11:11.350 --> 08:11:11.360 align:start position:0%
yeah that is certainly probably the
 
08:11:13.670 --> 08:11:13.680 align:start position:0%
scariest part about this bill is that it
 
08:11:16.708 --> 08:11:16.718 align:start position:0%
is really based off of perception versus
 
08:11:16.718 --> 08:11:18.070 align:start position:0%
is really based off of perception versus
anything

08:11:18.070 --> 08:11:18.080 align:start position:0%
anything
 
08:11:19.830 --> 08:11:19.840 align:start position:0%
based in reality now i'm going to tell
 
08:11:22.628 --> 08:11:22.638 align:start position:0%
you as a woman who you know
 
08:11:24.468 --> 08:11:24.478 align:start position:0%
pulls out my car keys and holds it in
 
08:11:26.548 --> 08:11:26.558 align:start position:0%
her hand as i walk to my car late at
 
08:11:29.030 --> 08:11:29.040 align:start position:0%
night like many other women do
 
08:11:31.430 --> 08:11:31.440 align:start position:0%
and per and rightfully is very cautious
 
08:11:33.190 --> 08:11:33.200 align:start position:0%
about my surroundings
 
08:11:33.200 --> 08:11:34.150 align:start position:0%
about my surroundings
um

08:11:34.150 --> 08:11:34.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
08:11:36.548 --> 08:11:36.558 align:start position:0%
i do not want to have a situation for
 
08:11:39.110 --> 08:11:39.120 align:start position:0%
for somebody who is in a situation like
 
08:11:40.948 --> 08:11:40.958 align:start position:0%
that and without doing due diligence or
 
08:11:43.350 --> 08:11:43.360 align:start position:0%
without having any actual threat
 
08:11:45.670 --> 08:11:45.680 align:start position:0%
uh would feel justified to shoot and
 
08:11:47.750 --> 08:11:47.760 align:start position:0%
kill somebody else in a situation like
 
08:11:50.150 --> 08:11:50.160 align:start position:0%
that um just because they themselves
 
08:11:52.468 --> 08:11:52.478 align:start position:0%
were nervous or again at the
 
08:11:55.030 --> 08:11:55.040 align:start position:0%
intersection of how um racial injustice
 
08:11:57.270 --> 08:11:57.280 align:start position:0%
plays into here again
 
08:11:58.628 --> 08:11:58.638 align:start position:0%
you know people
 
08:12:00.788 --> 08:12:00.798 align:start position:0%
we have people in our society who view
 
08:12:02.310 --> 08:12:02.320 align:start position:0%
our black and ground brothers and
 
08:12:04.628 --> 08:12:04.638 align:start position:0%
sisters as threats just for being the
 
08:12:07.110 --> 08:12:07.120 align:start position:0%
people who they are and these are the
 
08:12:09.350 --> 08:12:09.360 align:start position:0%
concerns that we need to have so
 
08:12:11.190 --> 08:12:11.200 align:start position:0%
the language here is is
 
08:12:14.628 --> 08:12:14.638 align:start position:0%
very very broad it basically opens up a
 
08:12:17.430 --> 08:12:17.440 align:start position:0%
license to kill for anyone at any point
 
08:12:19.350 --> 08:12:19.360 align:start position:0%
um and this is not the type of bill that
 
08:12:21.110 --> 08:12:21.120 align:start position:0%
we should have uh go through in new
 
08:12:21.120 --> 08:12:29.990 align:start position:0%
we should have uh go through in new
hampshire

08:12:29.990 --> 08:12:30.000 align:start position:0%
 
08:12:33.110 --> 08:12:33.120 align:start position:0%
i just want to remind the members
 
08:12:35.270 --> 08:12:35.280 align:start position:0%
that the difference whenever remember
 
08:12:37.670 --> 08:12:37.680 align:start position:0%
the public is testifying they're free to
 
08:12:39.910 --> 08:12:39.920 align:start position:0%
state their opinions but the members are
 
08:12:42.788 --> 08:12:42.798 align:start position:0%
not supposed to speak or comment or
 
08:12:44.708 --> 08:12:44.718 align:start position:0%
imply what the motives of other members
 
08:12:47.270 --> 08:12:47.280 align:start position:0%
of the body are so for the members
 
08:12:49.430 --> 08:12:49.440 align:start position:0%
of the community to apply the motives of
 
08:12:49.440 --> 08:12:50.628 align:start position:0%
of the community to apply the motives of
the

08:12:50.628 --> 08:12:50.638 align:start position:0%
the
 
08:12:52.868 --> 08:12:52.878 align:start position:0%
other members who sponsored this bill
 
08:12:55.350 --> 08:12:55.360 align:start position:0%
that would not be a program and i just i
 
08:12:56.310 --> 08:12:56.320 align:start position:0%
just want to
 
08:12:57.590 --> 08:12:57.600 align:start position:0%
make that warning to the members of the
 
08:12:57.600 --> 08:13:00.548 align:start position:0%
make that warning to the members of the
community

08:13:00.548 --> 08:13:00.558 align:start position:0%
 
08:13:01.910 --> 08:13:01.920 align:start position:0%
representative harper
 
08:13:04.150 --> 08:13:04.160 align:start position:0%
and thank you mr chair and thank you
 
08:13:07.030 --> 08:13:07.040 align:start position:0%
miss price um
 
08:13:09.350 --> 08:13:09.360 align:start position:0%
all day long i've been getting a little
 
08:13:11.030 --> 08:13:11.040 align:start position:0%
bit agitated
 
08:13:14.388 --> 08:13:14.398 align:start position:0%
because all day long uh you included
 
08:13:16.788 --> 08:13:16.798 align:start position:0%
have implied that there's uh massive
 
08:13:19.270 --> 08:13:19.280 align:start position:0%
racism all throughout new hampshire and
 
08:13:21.110 --> 08:13:21.120 align:start position:0%
that the people of new hampshire can't
 
08:13:23.270 --> 08:13:23.280 align:start position:0%
be trusted or the right to defend
 
08:13:24.708 --> 08:13:24.718 align:start position:0%
themselves because they're going to use
 
08:13:26.708 --> 08:13:26.718 align:start position:0%
it against people of color
 
08:13:28.628 --> 08:13:28.638 align:start position:0%
where do you come up with those that
 
08:13:30.070 --> 08:13:30.080 align:start position:0%
prep premise
 
08:13:32.548 --> 08:13:32.558 align:start position:0%
i know you quoted the southern poverty
 
08:13:35.510 --> 08:13:35.520 align:start position:0%
law center but that's not new hampshire
 
08:13:37.830 --> 08:13:37.840 align:start position:0%
so where do you come up with this idea
 
08:13:39.350 --> 08:13:39.360 align:start position:0%
that we're you know the people in new
 
08:13:41.270 --> 08:13:41.280 align:start position:0%
hampshire are so racist they can't
 
08:13:44.310 --> 08:13:44.320 align:start position:0%
 
08:13:45.910 --> 08:13:45.920 align:start position:0%
representative hopper i would love to
 
08:13:47.350 --> 08:13:47.360 align:start position:0%
answer your question but i think that
 
08:13:48.708 --> 08:13:48.718 align:start position:0%
you and i have a fundamental
 
08:13:50.230 --> 08:13:50.240 align:start position:0%
disagreement about whether or not
 
08:14:12.070 --> 08:14:12.080 align:start position:0%
 
08:14:14.468 --> 08:14:14.478 align:start position:0%
i'm still here that was my response
 
08:14:25.830 --> 08:14:25.840 align:start position:0%
 
08:14:27.910 --> 08:14:27.920 align:start position:0%
see no no further hands up i want to
 
08:14:30.070 --> 08:14:30.080 align:start position:0%
thank the witness for their testimony
 
08:14:37.030 --> 08:14:37.040 align:start position:0%
 
08:14:39.190 --> 08:14:39.200 align:start position:0%
i just want to remind the members too
 
08:14:40.788 --> 08:14:40.798 align:start position:0%
here on this this bill before the
 
08:14:42.388 --> 08:14:42.398 align:start position:0%
committee the reason why i'm concerned
 
08:14:43.670 --> 08:14:43.680 align:start position:0%
about speaking about the motives of
 
08:14:45.350 --> 08:14:45.360 align:start position:0%
other members there is a member of this
 
08:14:47.750 --> 08:14:47.760 align:start position:0%
committee who's a co-sponsor of the bill
 
08:14:47.760 --> 08:14:49.990 align:start position:0%
committee who's a co-sponsor of the bill
and

08:14:49.990 --> 08:14:50.000 align:start position:0%
 
08:14:52.070 --> 08:14:52.080 align:start position:0%
i don't think we should imply that i'll
 
08:14:53.670 --> 08:14:53.680 align:start position:0%
imply anything about that particular
 
08:15:07.270 --> 08:15:07.280 align:start position:0%
 
08:15:09.430 --> 08:15:09.440 align:start position:0%
we do have one more person
 
08:15:11.270 --> 08:15:11.280 align:start position:0%
in the attendee list with the hand
 
08:15:11.280 --> 08:15:13.350 align:start position:0%
in the attendee list with the hand
raised

08:15:13.350 --> 08:15:13.360 align:start position:0%
raised
 
08:15:13.360 --> 08:15:14.708 align:start position:0%
raised
mrs

08:15:14.708 --> 08:15:14.718 align:start position:0%
mrs
 
08:15:18.310 --> 08:15:18.320 align:start position:0%
hi thank you for allowing me to testify
 
08:15:20.310 --> 08:15:20.320 align:start position:0%
my name is louise spencer i'm from
 
08:15:21.990 --> 08:15:22.000 align:start position:0%
concord new hampshire
 
08:15:24.548 --> 08:15:24.558 align:start position:0%
i was going to testify on the next bill
 
08:15:27.030 --> 08:15:27.040 align:start position:0%
but my comments apply to both so i
 
08:15:28.468 --> 08:15:28.478 align:start position:0%
thought in the interest of time i would
 
08:15:31.430 --> 08:15:31.440 align:start position:0%
go ahead and testify now
 
08:15:34.070 --> 08:15:34.080 align:start position:0%
i have to say that
 
08:15:36.708 --> 08:15:36.718 align:start position:0%
it's already scary enough at times to
 
08:15:39.430 --> 08:15:39.440 align:start position:0%
walk around in new hampshire and see
 
08:15:43.990 --> 08:15:44.000 align:start position:0%
people carrying open carrying long guns
 
08:15:46.628 --> 08:15:46.638 align:start position:0%
and with my having to assume that they
 
08:15:49.110 --> 08:15:49.120 align:start position:0%
have nothing but good intentions toward
 
08:15:49.120 --> 08:15:50.070 align:start position:0%
have nothing but good intentions toward
me

08:15:50.070 --> 08:15:50.080 align:start position:0%
me
 
08:15:53.750 --> 08:15:53.760 align:start position:0%
the idea that somebody doing this
 
08:15:56.150 --> 08:15:56.160 align:start position:0%
would um
 
08:15:57.990 --> 08:15:58.000 align:start position:0%
now be able to
 
08:16:00.388 --> 08:16:00.398 align:start position:0%
assess me as a threat in a totally
 
08:16:01.990 --> 08:16:02.000 align:start position:0%
subjective way
 
08:16:02.000 --> 08:16:03.190 align:start position:0%
subjective way
is

08:16:03.190 --> 08:16:03.200 align:start position:0%
is
 
08:16:06.230 --> 08:16:06.240 align:start position:0%
terrifying and i can only imagine that
 
08:16:08.070 --> 08:16:08.080 align:start position:0%
for people of color
 
08:16:09.190 --> 08:16:09.200 align:start position:0%
who are
 
08:16:11.430 --> 08:16:11.440 align:start position:0%
way too often perceived
 
08:16:15.510 --> 08:16:15.520 align:start position:0%
as threats that this would be
 
08:16:19.190 --> 08:16:19.200 align:start position:0%
very extremely terrifying um i would
 
08:16:20.868 --> 08:16:20.878 align:start position:0%
note that in response to one of the
 
08:16:22.548 --> 08:16:22.558 align:start position:0%
questions earlier
 
08:16:24.468 --> 08:16:24.478 align:start position:0%
uh in the past
 
08:16:24.478 --> 08:16:25.270 align:start position:0%
uh in the past
um

08:16:25.270 --> 08:16:25.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
08:16:28.628 --> 08:16:28.638 align:start position:0%
with the past speaker that most of the
 
08:16:31.510 --> 08:16:31.520 align:start position:0%
comments being made about the threats
 
08:16:34.230 --> 08:16:34.240 align:start position:0%
are from black lives matters events that
 
08:16:36.230 --> 08:16:36.240 align:start position:0%
took place outside of the state i just
 
08:16:39.430 --> 08:16:39.440 align:start position:0%
want to make note of that
 
08:16:41.670 --> 08:16:41.680 align:start position:0%
and then finally i would say
 
08:16:41.680 --> 08:16:42.708 align:start position:0%
and then finally i would say
that

08:16:42.708 --> 08:16:42.718 align:start position:0%
that
 
08:16:45.350 --> 08:16:45.360 align:start position:0%
it seems to me that if my loved one were
 
08:16:47.670 --> 08:16:47.680 align:start position:0%
killed by somebody claiming
 
08:16:50.548 --> 08:16:50.558 align:start position:0%
subjectively claiming in an untestable
 
08:16:52.628 --> 08:16:52.638 align:start position:0%
legally legal way
 
08:16:52.638 --> 08:16:53.590 align:start position:0%
legally legal way
that

08:16:53.590 --> 08:16:53.600 align:start position:0%
that
 
08:16:55.590 --> 08:16:55.600 align:start position:0%
they had killed my loved one because
 
08:16:57.350 --> 08:16:57.360 align:start position:0%
they felt threatened
 
08:16:57.360 --> 08:16:58.150 align:start position:0%
they felt threatened
that

08:16:58.150 --> 08:16:58.160 align:start position:0%
that
 
08:16:59.910 --> 08:16:59.920 align:start position:0%
i would hope that
 
08:17:01.750 --> 08:17:01.760 align:start position:0%
it would not be the case that they would
 
08:17:03.110 --> 08:17:03.120 align:start position:0%
not be
 
08:17:06.070 --> 08:17:06.080 align:start position:0%
able to be charged as the prior attorney
 
08:17:08.230 --> 08:17:08.240 align:start position:0%
who spoke talked about the need for
 
08:17:09.910 --> 08:17:09.920 align:start position:0%
these laws was that people should not
 
08:17:13.030 --> 08:17:13.040 align:start position:0%
have to be charged when they act in
 
08:17:15.430 --> 08:17:15.440 align:start position:0%
self-defense i think that is something
 
08:17:17.590 --> 08:17:17.600 align:start position:0%
that really needs to be tested in a
 
08:17:20.070 --> 08:17:20.080 align:start position:0%
court of law and that if somebody is
 
08:17:22.868 --> 08:17:22.878 align:start position:0%
willing to use deadly force and they
 
08:17:24.230 --> 08:17:24.240 align:start position:0%
kill somebody
 
08:17:25.670 --> 08:17:25.680 align:start position:0%
that person
 
08:17:28.310 --> 08:17:28.320 align:start position:0%
is a human being and they also are
 
08:17:30.628 --> 08:17:30.638 align:start position:0%
entitled to justice it should not be
 
08:17:32.468 --> 08:17:32.478 align:start position:0%
assumed that they were the person in the
 
08:17:32.478 --> 08:17:33.430 align:start position:0%
assumed that they were the person in the
wrong

08:17:33.430 --> 08:17:33.440 align:start position:0%
wrong
 
08:17:33.440 --> 08:17:34.150 align:start position:0%
wrong
so

08:17:34.150 --> 08:17:34.160 align:start position:0%
so
 
08:17:35.270 --> 08:17:35.280 align:start position:0%
i really
 
08:17:37.110 --> 08:17:37.120 align:start position:0%
you know to ask someone to have to go to
 
08:17:39.750 --> 08:17:39.760 align:start position:0%
court to justify the action that they
 
08:17:42.830 --> 08:17:42.840 align:start position:0%
took i think is a small price for taking
 
08:17:46.070 --> 08:17:46.080 align:start position:0%
somebody's life so thank you those those
 
08:17:48.548 --> 08:17:48.558 align:start position:0%
are my comments and i'm happy to take
 
08:17:50.388 --> 08:17:50.398 align:start position:0%
questions but i'm
 
08:18:00.548 --> 08:18:00.558 align:start position:0%
 
08:18:03.910 --> 08:18:03.920 align:start position:0%
seeing no hands raised
 
08:18:22.468 --> 08:18:22.478 align:start position:0%
 
08:18:22.478 --> 08:18:41.670 align:start position:0%
 
this

08:18:41.670 --> 08:18:41.680 align:start position:0%
 
08:18:42.868 --> 08:18:42.878 align:start position:0%
seeing no additional members of the
 
08:18:45.110 --> 08:18:45.120 align:start position:0%
public that wish to testify
 
08:18:47.030 --> 08:18:47.040 align:start position:0%
this would help
 
08:18:51.910 --> 08:18:51.920 align:start position:0%
close the hearing on hb 197.
 
08:18:59.590 --> 08:18:59.600 align:start position:0%
 
08:19:02.548 --> 08:19:02.558 align:start position:0%
uh on house bill 197
 
08:19:05.030 --> 08:19:05.040 align:start position:0%
there were 79 people who signed in in
 
08:19:07.468 --> 08:19:07.478 align:start position:0%
support of the bill and there were 900
 
08:19:17.990 --> 08:19:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
08:19:21.030 --> 08:19:21.040 align:start position:0%
thank you representative muse
 
08:19:23.670 --> 08:19:23.680 align:start position:0%
before we go any further i did tell
 
08:19:25.190 --> 08:19:25.200 align:start position:0%
everyone that the goal of this committee
 
08:19:29.430 --> 08:19:29.440 align:start position:0%
 
08:19:30.868 --> 08:19:30.878 align:start position:0%
clearly that that didn't work out so
 
08:19:30.878 --> 08:19:31.910 align:start position:0%
clearly that that didn't work out so
well

08:19:31.910 --> 08:19:31.920 align:start position:0%
well
 
08:19:34.150 --> 08:19:34.160 align:start position:0%
there are members there is enough i mean
 
08:19:35.750 --> 08:19:35.760 align:start position:0%
for the public hearing purposes we don't
 
08:19:37.910 --> 08:19:37.920 align:start position:0%
need to have a
 
08:19:40.070 --> 08:19:40.080 align:start position:0%
form in order to proceed
 
08:19:40.080 --> 08:19:40.788 align:start position:0%
form in order to proceed
so

08:19:40.788 --> 08:19:40.798 align:start position:0%
so
 
08:19:43.430 --> 08:19:43.440 align:start position:0%
i'm going to proceed with
 
08:19:48.948 --> 08:19:48.958 align:start position:0%
 
08:19:51.190 --> 08:19:51.200 align:start position:0%
but i'm just planning it well no it's it
 
08:19:54.310 --> 08:19:54.320 align:start position:0%
is it's a friday and it's 5 30 but it is
 
08:19:55.670 --> 08:19:55.680 align:start position:0%
scheduled and
 
08:19:56.788 --> 08:19:56.798 align:start position:0%
i know the
 
08:19:59.110 --> 08:19:59.120 align:start position:0%
bill sponsors
 
08:19:59.120 --> 08:20:00.708 align:start position:0%
bill sponsors
president

08:20:00.708 --> 08:20:00.718 align:start position:0%
president
 
08:20:02.150 --> 08:20:02.160 align:start position:0%
i just want to get a feel for the
 
08:20:03.110 --> 08:20:03.120 align:start position:0%
committee because i didn't make a
 
08:20:04.388 --> 08:20:04.398 align:start position:0%
promise and i
 
08:20:06.948 --> 08:20:06.958 align:start position:0%
try to honor my work but
 
08:20:10.548 --> 08:20:10.558 align:start position:0%
 
08:20:12.230 --> 08:20:12.240 align:start position:0%
representative morrison
 
08:20:13.990 --> 08:20:14.000 align:start position:0%
i can't hear enough of what you're
 
08:20:16.150 --> 08:20:16.160 align:start position:0%
saying to understand
 
08:20:18.388 --> 08:20:18.398 align:start position:0%
so i made a i told the community that we
 
08:20:19.510 --> 08:20:19.520 align:start position:0%
were not going to
 
08:20:21.430 --> 08:20:21.440 align:start position:0%
we would not have any hearings past five
 
08:20:25.430 --> 08:20:25.440 align:start position:0%
o'clock and here we are it's almost 5 25
 
08:20:27.590 --> 08:20:27.600 align:start position:0%
on a friday and we have one bill left
 
08:20:29.990 --> 08:20:30.000 align:start position:0%
that we haven't even began the public
 
08:20:31.670 --> 08:20:31.680 align:start position:0%
hearing before
 
08:20:31.680 --> 08:20:32.548 align:start position:0%
hearing before
so

08:20:32.548 --> 08:20:32.558 align:start position:0%
so
 
08:20:34.708 --> 08:20:34.718 align:start position:0%
trying to be as close to keeping my word
 
08:20:36.150 --> 08:20:36.160 align:start position:0%
as possible
 
08:20:37.590 --> 08:20:37.600 align:start position:0%
i will say that if people do need to
 
08:20:37.600 --> 08:20:39.190 align:start position:0%
i will say that if people do need to
leave

08:20:39.190 --> 08:20:39.200 align:start position:0%
leave
 
08:20:41.110 --> 08:20:41.120 align:start position:0%
i understand but for the purposes of the
 
08:20:42.788 --> 08:20:42.798 align:start position:0%
public hearing
 
08:20:45.350 --> 08:20:45.360 align:start position:0%
we don't need to have a quorum for that
 
08:20:45.360 --> 08:20:47.270 align:start position:0%
we don't need to have a quorum for that
so

08:20:47.270 --> 08:20:47.280 align:start position:0%
so
 
08:20:49.110 --> 08:20:49.120 align:start position:0%
it i would prefer to keep
 
08:20:50.388 --> 08:20:50.398 align:start position:0%
i would prefer to have the public
 
08:20:51.910 --> 08:20:51.920 align:start position:0%
hearing these the people
 
08:20:54.230 --> 08:20:54.240 align:start position:0%
were here to testify
 
08:20:57.270 --> 08:20:57.280 align:start position:0%
this was scheduled right leave at 2 30
 
08:20:58.868 --> 08:20:58.878 align:start position:0%
and they're still here waiting so i
 
08:20:59.990 --> 08:21:00.000 align:start position:0%
really think out of respect for the
 
08:21:02.468 --> 08:21:02.478 align:start position:0%
members of the public we do it but
 
08:21:03.590 --> 08:21:03.600 align:start position:0%

08:21:06.070 --> 08:21:06.080 align:start position:0%
committee on that because
 
08:21:07.590 --> 08:21:07.600 align:start position:0%

a quarter floor i i will say that for
 
08:21:32.310 --> 08:21:32.320 align:start position:0%

i
 
08:21:36.948 --> 08:21:36.958 align:start position:0%
 
08:21:38.548 --> 08:21:38.558 align:start position:0%
i would not do i will not do an
 
08:21:40.708 --> 08:21:40.718 align:start position:0%
executive session without the blessing
 
08:21:42.310 --> 08:21:42.320 align:start position:0%
of the ranking member of the other
 
08:21:42.320 --> 08:21:43.990 align:start position:0%

uh in fairness to all the people that
 
08:21:48.468 --> 08:21:48.478 align:start position:0%
are participating because it is late it
 
08:21:51.510 --> 08:21:51.520 align:start position:0%
 
08:21:54.388 --> 08:21:54.398 align:start position:0%
you so that's just that's my discretion
 
08:21:55.830 --> 08:21:55.840 align:start position:0%
i normally would never do that but this
 
08:21:57.430 --> 08:21:57.440 align:start position:0%
is a scenario
 
08:21:58.628 --> 08:21:58.638 align:start position:0%
considering how many bills we have in
 
08:22:00.468 --> 08:22:00.478 align:start position:0%
committee i really would like to see
 
08:22:04.388 --> 08:22:04.398 align:start position:0%

08:22:31.510 --> 08:22:31.520 align:start position:0%
mr chairman i believe that this
 
08:22:33.590 --> 08:22:33.600 align:start position:0%
committee has always waited long enough
 
08:22:34.868 --> 08:22:34.878 align:start position:0%
to hear the public when they had
 
08:22:36.310 --> 08:22:36.320 align:start position:0%
something to say and if people are
 
08:22:38.788 --> 08:22:38.798 align:start position:0%
present i'm more than willing to stay to
 
08:22:40.708 --> 08:22:40.718 align:start position:0%
listen to the people that are present
 
08:22:42.868 --> 08:22:42.878 align:start position:0%
i'm and i'm happy to hear that you're
 
08:22:44.868 --> 08:22:44.878 align:start position:0%
not going to hold an executive session
 
08:22:58.468 --> 08:22:58.478 align:start position:0%
 
08:23:00.468 --> 08:23:00.478 align:start position:0%
it would not be done without the i would
 
08:23:01.910 --> 08:23:01.920 align:start position:0%
give my word on it would not be done
 
08:23:03.590 --> 08:23:03.600 align:start position:0%
without the blessing of the ranking
 
08:23:03.600 --> 08:23:05.990 align:start position:0%

08:23:08.708 --> 08:23:08.718 align:start position:0%
fine i will be here for this as well and
 
08:23:11.110 --> 08:23:11.120 align:start position:0%
i do think we need to finish the
 
08:23:13.190 --> 08:23:13.200 align:start position:0%
work of the day because people took the
 
08:23:14.628 --> 08:23:14.638 align:start position:0%
time to be here and some of the people
 
08:23:17.830 --> 08:23:17.840 align:start position:0%

08:23:21.590 --> 08:23:21.600 align:start position:0%
i i i agree 100 what's saying i just

08:24:39.590 --> 08:24:41.110 align:start position:0%
is intended to simply remove
[Music]

08:24:41.110 --> 08:24:41.120 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
08:24:43.750 --> 08:24:43.760 align:start position:0%
completely remove the duty to retreat
 
08:24:45.670 --> 08:24:45.680 align:start position:0%
and enhance stand your ground i did
 
08:24:47.110 --> 08:24:47.120 align:start position:0%
include an amendment that i emailed to
 
08:24:48.868 --> 08:24:48.878 align:start position:0%
all members of the committee to respond
 
08:24:50.150 --> 08:24:50.160 align:start position:0%
to some of the concerns by some of the
 
08:24:51.510 --> 08:24:51.520 align:start position:0%
defense attorneys and members of the
 
08:24:51.520 --> 08:24:53.270 align:start position:0%
defense attorneys and members of the
house

08:24:53.270 --> 08:24:53.280 align:start position:0%
house
 
08:24:55.990 --> 08:24:56.000 align:start position:0%
but i want to give you a real quick
 
08:24:58.868 --> 08:24:58.878 align:start position:0%
talk as quick as i can um
 
08:25:00.150 --> 08:25:00.160 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
08:25:01.750 --> 08:25:01.760 align:start position:0%
the reason for this bill is that
 
08:25:03.430 --> 08:25:03.440 align:start position:0%
currently there's an exception to
 
08:25:05.910 --> 08:25:05.920 align:start position:0%
self-defense law that basically says
 
08:25:09.670 --> 08:25:09.680 align:start position:0%
that um you don't you do have a right to
 
08:25:11.670 --> 08:25:11.680 align:start position:0%
stand your ground you don't have a
 
08:25:13.590 --> 08:25:13.600 align:start position:0%
what i call a duty to die
 
08:25:15.510 --> 08:25:15.520 align:start position:0%
there's no duty to die there's no
 
08:25:17.670 --> 08:25:17.680 align:start position:0%
requirement that you get get attacked or
 
08:25:17.680 --> 08:25:18.628 align:start position:0%
requirement that you get get attacked or
killed

08:25:18.628 --> 08:25:18.638 align:start position:0%
killed
 
08:25:20.468 --> 08:25:20.478 align:start position:0%
if you're in your home or any place you
 
08:25:23.030 --> 08:25:23.040 align:start position:0%
have a legal right to be under rsa 627
 
08:25:24.788 --> 08:25:24.798 align:start position:0%
section 4 part 3.
 
08:25:27.110 --> 08:25:27.120 align:start position:0%
but that part three has a lot of
 
08:25:28.948 --> 08:25:28.958 align:start position:0%
exceptions to it
 
08:25:30.548 --> 08:25:30.558 align:start position:0%
um and
 
08:25:32.548 --> 08:25:32.558 align:start position:0%
people have a tendency to believe
 
08:25:34.230 --> 08:25:34.240 align:start position:0%
that it's based on what actually did
 
08:25:36.868 --> 08:25:36.878 align:start position:0%
happen but um the law self-defense law
 
08:25:38.708 --> 08:25:38.718 align:start position:0%
is not based on what did happen it's
 
08:25:40.548 --> 08:25:40.558 align:start position:0%
what your attacker claimed
 
08:25:43.030 --> 08:25:43.040 align:start position:0%
and what prosecutor is able to argue and
 
08:25:44.548 --> 08:25:44.558 align:start position:0%
get away with
 
08:25:44.558 --> 08:25:45.910 align:start position:0%
get away with
um

08:25:45.910 --> 08:25:45.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
08:25:47.830 --> 08:25:47.840 align:start position:0%
so in the violent brawl that i i've
 
08:25:50.150 --> 08:25:50.160 align:start position:0%
brought up a number of times before
 
08:25:52.230 --> 08:25:52.240 align:start position:0%
when the brawl the fight broke out in my
 
08:25:54.310 --> 08:25:54.320 align:start position:0%
home people were trespassing by their
 
08:25:56.628 --> 08:25:56.638 align:start position:0%
own admission they took the stand and
 
08:25:56.638 --> 08:25:57.830 align:start position:0%
own admission they took the stand and
admitted

08:25:57.830 --> 08:25:57.840 align:start position:0%
admitted
 
08:25:59.430 --> 08:25:59.440 align:start position:0%
uh contrary to their own interest that
 
08:26:00.868 --> 08:26:00.878 align:start position:0%
they were told to leave
 
08:26:02.308 --> 08:26:02.318 align:start position:0%
a couple of people said that they were
 
08:26:04.868 --> 08:26:04.878 align:start position:0%
told to leave
 
08:26:06.948 --> 08:26:06.958 align:start position:0%
a couple of times when the fight broke
 
08:26:09.910 --> 08:26:09.920 align:start position:0%
out so that opens up a legal question
 
08:26:12.628 --> 08:26:12.638 align:start position:0%
uh now that they're trespassing
 
08:26:14.388 --> 08:26:14.398 align:start position:0%
in the middle of this brawl woman came
 
08:26:15.830 --> 08:26:15.840 align:start position:0%
down with an upturned knife and beer
 
08:26:18.308 --> 08:26:18.318 align:start position:0%
bottle threatening to kill people
 
08:26:20.070 --> 08:26:20.080 align:start position:0%
she had an outstanding arrest warrant
 
08:26:21.590 --> 08:26:21.600 align:start position:0%
numerous priors
 
08:26:23.430 --> 08:26:23.440 align:start position:0%
the woman she was trying to stab the
 
08:26:24.948 --> 08:26:24.958 align:start position:0%
large woman she was trying to stab in
 
08:26:26.628 --> 08:26:26.638 align:start position:0%
the throat
 
08:26:28.308 --> 08:26:28.318 align:start position:0%
she also had an outstanding arrest
 
08:26:30.468 --> 08:26:30.478 align:start position:0%
warrant numerous priors and some of the
 
08:26:31.990 --> 08:26:32.000 align:start position:0%
other people had outstanding arrest
 
08:26:34.070 --> 08:26:34.080 align:start position:0%
warrants and numerous priors prior
 
08:26:36.308 --> 08:26:36.318 align:start position:0%
convictions and uh chart criminal
 
08:26:36.318 --> 08:26:37.510 align:start position:0%
convictions and uh chart criminal
charges

08:26:37.510 --> 08:26:37.520 align:start position:0%
charges
 
08:26:39.350 --> 08:26:39.360 align:start position:0%
so the question is
 
08:26:41.350 --> 08:26:41.360 align:start position:0%
so those people are now trespassing on
 
08:26:43.270 --> 08:26:43.280 align:start position:0%
the property
 
08:26:43.280 --> 08:26:44.788 align:start position:0%
the property
um

08:26:44.788 --> 08:26:44.798 align:start position:0%
um
 
08:26:46.388 --> 08:26:46.398 align:start position:0%
excuse me
 
08:26:48.628 --> 08:26:48.638 align:start position:0%
do they now lose the right
 
08:26:51.270 --> 08:26:51.280 align:start position:0%
to use either non-deadly force or deadly
 
08:26:53.190 --> 08:26:53.200 align:start position:0%
force to defend themselves when a fight
 
08:26:54.388 --> 08:26:54.398 align:start position:0%
breaks out
 
08:26:55.750 --> 08:26:55.760 align:start position:0%
and and this could be anywhere this
 
08:26:56.788 --> 08:26:56.798 align:start position:0%
could be
 
08:26:59.830 --> 08:26:59.840 align:start position:0%
at a sports game or a bar
 
08:27:02.308 --> 08:27:02.318 align:start position:0%
or anywhere else a bar after last call
 
08:27:05.190 --> 08:27:05.200 align:start position:0%
or a sports arena
 
08:27:07.750 --> 08:27:07.760 align:start position:0%
when people have been
 
08:27:10.230 --> 08:27:10.240 align:start position:0%
told to leave or any other you know
 
08:27:12.868 --> 08:27:12.878 align:start position:0%
public park or public place where they
 
08:27:15.190 --> 08:27:15.200 align:start position:0%
had a legal right to be but then they've
 
08:27:17.030 --> 08:27:17.040 align:start position:0%
lost the legal right to remain maybe
 
08:27:18.868 --> 08:27:18.878 align:start position:0%
they've been asked to leave and now
 
08:27:20.948 --> 08:27:20.958 align:start position:0%
they're legally trespassing
 
08:27:22.788 --> 08:27:22.798 align:start position:0%
do they lose the right to self-defense
 
08:27:24.948 --> 08:27:24.958 align:start position:0%
unfortunately under the current law
 
08:27:27.110 --> 08:27:27.120 align:start position:0%
uh you do lose the right to self-defense
 
08:27:29.670 --> 08:27:29.680 align:start position:0%
as soon as you're you're told to leave
 
08:27:30.948 --> 08:27:30.958 align:start position:0%
so you could be attacked and you
 
08:27:32.708 --> 08:27:32.718 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be able to do anything this
 
08:27:35.350 --> 08:27:35.360 align:start position:0%
might seem like a small or a very rare
 
08:27:35.360 --> 08:27:36.230 align:start position:0%
might seem like a small or a very rare
case

08:27:36.230 --> 08:27:36.240 align:start position:0%
case
 
08:27:39.510 --> 08:27:39.520 align:start position:0%
um but it it it really isn't so in the
 
08:27:39.520 --> 08:27:40.548 align:start position:0%
um but it it it really isn't so in the
amendment

08:27:40.548 --> 08:27:40.558 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
08:27:42.308 --> 08:27:42.318 align:start position:0%
um i
 
08:27:44.548 --> 08:27:44.558 align:start position:0%
oh my gosh my head's getting tired it's
 
08:27:47.350 --> 08:27:47.360 align:start position:0%
so late
 
08:27:49.110 --> 08:27:49.120 align:start position:0%
i proposed
 
08:27:51.670 --> 08:27:51.680 align:start position:0%
uh in the amendment simply clarifying
 
08:27:53.430 --> 08:27:53.440 align:start position:0%
the law to simply say what they say in
 
08:27:55.430 --> 08:27:55.440 align:start position:0%
arizona and florida utah and other
 
08:27:57.990 --> 08:27:58.000 align:start position:0%
states quote there is no duty to retreat
 
08:27:59.430 --> 08:27:59.440 align:start position:0%
from threatening
 
08:28:01.190 --> 08:28:01.200 align:start position:0%
or using physical force or deadly
 
08:28:03.190 --> 08:28:03.200 align:start position:0%
physical force justified by this chapter
 
08:28:04.948 --> 08:28:04.958 align:start position:0%
so this would extend this is a stand
 
08:28:06.468 --> 08:28:06.478 align:start position:0%
your ground law the other bills were not
 
08:28:08.070 --> 08:28:08.080 align:start position:0%
stand your ground
 
08:28:10.308 --> 08:28:10.318 align:start position:0%
issues this is part three
 
08:28:12.628 --> 08:28:12.638 align:start position:0%
so it's it simply says
 
08:28:14.388 --> 08:28:14.398 align:start position:0%
um that
 
08:28:17.110 --> 08:28:17.120 align:start position:0%
no matter what the circumstances are um
 
08:28:18.868 --> 08:28:18.878 align:start position:0%
under either non-deadly force or deadly
 
08:28:20.230 --> 08:28:20.240 align:start position:0%
force there's never an in there would
 
08:28:22.788 --> 08:28:22.798 align:start position:0%
never be an insta
 
08:28:24.948 --> 08:28:24.958 align:start position:0%
situation where you lose the right to
 
08:28:26.868 --> 08:28:26.878 align:start position:0%
self-defense simply because you don't
 
08:28:29.270 --> 08:28:29.280 align:start position:0%
have the right to be there a typical
 
08:28:30.868 --> 08:28:30.878 align:start position:0%
case in point would be
 
08:28:33.110 --> 08:28:33.120 align:start position:0%
uh in the middle of the road
 
08:28:35.110 --> 08:28:35.120 align:start position:0%
um if somebody's driving at you for
 
08:28:37.430 --> 08:28:37.440 align:start position:0%
example to use uh some of the other
 
08:28:39.510 --> 08:28:39.520 align:start position:0%
cases you don't have a legal right to be
 
08:28:41.510 --> 08:28:41.520 align:start position:0%
in the middle of the road so does that
 
08:28:43.750 --> 08:28:43.760 align:start position:0%
mean that you lose the right
 
08:28:45.670 --> 08:28:45.680 align:start position:0%
to self-defense
 
08:28:48.548 --> 08:28:48.558 align:start position:0%
if you're if you're jaywalking or or
 
08:28:50.788 --> 08:28:50.798 align:start position:0%
some other situation prosecutor could
 
08:28:52.230 --> 08:28:52.240 align:start position:0%
argue anything and i'll tell you in any
 
08:28:54.150 --> 08:28:54.160 align:start position:0%
self-defense case your attackers are
 
08:28:55.670 --> 08:28:55.680 align:start position:0%
always going to say
 
08:28:57.830 --> 08:28:57.840 align:start position:0%
they're going to trivialize whatever it
 
08:29:00.230 --> 08:29:00.240 align:start position:0%
has been shown that they did trespassing
 
08:29:01.750 --> 08:29:01.760 align:start position:0%
attacking fighting
 
08:29:03.110 --> 08:29:03.120 align:start position:0%
what have you even with blood on the
 
08:29:04.230 --> 08:29:04.240 align:start position:0%
ground and
 
08:29:05.670 --> 08:29:05.680 align:start position:0%
other witnesses saying that their blood
 
08:29:07.830 --> 08:29:07.840 align:start position:0%
on people's face and arm and so forth
 
08:29:09.350 --> 08:29:09.360 align:start position:0%
whatever evidence that they bring up
 
08:29:10.628 --> 08:29:10.638 align:start position:0%
they're going to trivialize their own
 
08:29:12.230 --> 08:29:12.240 align:start position:0%
attack and then they're always going to
 
08:29:13.510 --> 08:29:13.520 align:start position:0%
say well i wasn't going to do anything
 
08:29:17.110 --> 08:29:17.120 align:start position:0%
worse than what i've had already done
 
08:29:18.628 --> 08:29:18.638 align:start position:0%
almost all
 
08:29:18.638 --> 08:29:20.388 align:start position:0%
almost all
murders

08:29:20.388 --> 08:29:20.398 align:start position:0%
murders
 
08:29:23.110 --> 08:29:23.120 align:start position:0%
kidnappings rapes
 
08:29:24.788 --> 08:29:24.798 align:start position:0%
deadly force level
 
08:29:27.910 --> 08:29:27.920 align:start position:0%
crimes are preceded by non-deadly force
 
08:29:30.628 --> 08:29:30.638 align:start position:0%
um intrusion trespassing smashing a
 
08:29:32.868 --> 08:29:32.878 align:start position:0%
window of something else so force tends
 
08:29:34.628 --> 08:29:34.638 align:start position:0%
to escalate very quickly and sometimes
 
08:29:36.150 --> 08:29:36.160 align:start position:0%
in less than a second you can go from
 
08:29:38.548 --> 08:29:38.558 align:start position:0%
non-deadly force danger to a deadly
 
08:29:40.868 --> 08:29:40.878 align:start position:0%
force danger
 
08:29:44.150 --> 08:29:44.160 align:start position:0%
i did add in part two of the amendment
 
08:29:44.160 --> 08:29:45.190 align:start position:0%
i did add in part two of the amendment
um

08:29:45.190 --> 08:29:45.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
08:29:46.948 --> 08:29:46.958 align:start position:0%
allowing the
 
08:29:48.868 --> 08:29:48.878 align:start position:0%
defense or more accurately allowing the
 
08:29:50.308 --> 08:29:50.318 align:start position:0%
jury to consider
 
08:29:51.750 --> 08:29:51.760 align:start position:0%
as they do in utah the nature of the
 
08:29:53.830 --> 08:29:53.840 align:start position:0%
danger the immediacy of immediacy of the
 
08:29:56.230 --> 08:29:56.240 align:start position:0%
danger the probability that the unlawful
 
08:29:57.830 --> 08:29:57.840 align:start position:0%
force would result in death or serious
 
08:29:59.590 --> 08:29:59.600 align:start position:0%
bodily injury
 
08:30:01.510 --> 08:30:01.520 align:start position:0%
the other person's prior violent acts or
 
08:30:03.190 --> 08:30:03.200 align:start position:0%
violent propensities whether known to
 
08:30:05.670 --> 08:30:05.680 align:start position:0%
the actor or not any pattern of abuse or
 
08:30:07.990 --> 08:30:08.000 align:start position:0%
violence in the party's relationship
 
08:30:09.830 --> 08:30:09.840 align:start position:0%
any crime committed at the location
 
08:30:11.990 --> 08:30:12.000 align:start position:0%
before the police arrive or would have
 
08:30:14.468 --> 08:30:14.478 align:start position:0%
arrived if notified
 
08:30:16.388 --> 08:30:16.398 align:start position:0%
in my self-defense case
 
08:30:18.308 --> 08:30:18.318 align:start position:0%
the prosecutor finally turned over after
 
08:30:20.788 --> 08:30:20.798 align:start position:0%
the trial started over 200 pages of
 
08:30:23.430 --> 08:30:23.440 align:start position:0%
criminal records on these gang members
 
08:30:23.440 --> 08:30:24.628 align:start position:0%
criminal records on these gang members
and

08:30:24.628 --> 08:30:24.638 align:start position:0%
and
 
08:30:26.948 --> 08:30:26.958 align:start position:0%
the reason that many states allow you to
 
08:30:26.958 --> 08:30:28.230 align:start position:0%
the reason that many states allow you to
to

08:30:28.230 --> 08:30:28.240 align:start position:0%
to
 
08:30:30.230 --> 08:30:30.240 align:start position:0%
to put that in front of the jury is so
 
08:30:34.388 --> 08:30:34.398 align:start position:0%
that the jurors have a better idea of
 
08:30:37.030 --> 08:30:37.040 align:start position:0%
how much danger you may have perceived
 
08:30:39.430 --> 08:30:39.440 align:start position:0%
typical case would be you have a rookie
 
08:30:41.430 --> 08:30:41.440 align:start position:0%
police officer with his partner
 
08:30:43.670 --> 08:30:43.680 align:start position:0%
the partner might know
 
08:30:45.830 --> 08:30:45.840 align:start position:0%
about the violent criminal history of
 
08:30:47.510 --> 08:30:47.520 align:start position:0%
the suspect criminal suspect that
 
08:30:49.750 --> 08:30:49.760 align:start position:0%
they're dealing with but the the partner
 
08:30:51.910 --> 08:30:51.920 align:start position:0%
might know might not know about that
 
08:30:53.510 --> 08:30:53.520 align:start position:0%
individual so
 
08:30:56.388 --> 08:30:56.398 align:start position:0%
if the officer kind of shooting or
 
08:30:57.590 --> 08:30:57.600 align:start position:0%
shooting back
 
08:30:59.830 --> 08:30:59.840 align:start position:0%
doesn't um
 
08:31:03.030 --> 08:31:03.040 align:start position:0%
have the criminal records it's very very
 
08:31:05.510 --> 08:31:05.520 align:start position:0%
difficult to explain in court
 
08:31:07.350 --> 08:31:07.360 align:start position:0%
how much danger there was i asked the
 
08:31:09.590 --> 08:31:09.600 align:start position:0%
witnesses at trial you know how much
 
08:31:11.750 --> 08:31:11.760 align:start position:0%
danger was there and none obviously none
 
08:31:13.350 --> 08:31:13.360 align:start position:0%
of the witnesses were able to articulate
 
08:31:16.628 --> 08:31:16.638 align:start position:0%
using words how much danger there was so
 
08:31:18.230 --> 08:31:18.240 align:start position:0%
a really difficult time
 
08:31:20.070 --> 08:31:20.080 align:start position:0%
trying to say it's already escalated to
 
08:31:22.230 --> 08:31:22.240 align:start position:0%
this level and then it's escalated it's
 
08:31:23.910 --> 08:31:23.920 align:start position:0%
exponentially worse and now it's going
 
08:31:25.750 --> 08:31:25.760 align:start position:0%
to escalate to the point where people
 
08:31:28.388 --> 08:31:28.398 align:start position:0%
could get killed or seriously injured
 
08:31:30.948 --> 08:31:30.958 align:start position:0%
and it's hard especially when some of
 
08:31:32.868 --> 08:31:32.878 align:start position:0%
the witnesses are or criminals or gang
 
08:31:34.788 --> 08:31:34.798 align:start position:0%
members they don't necessarily have the
 
08:31:37.510 --> 08:31:37.520 align:start position:0%
legal vocabulary to articulate that and
 
08:31:38.948 --> 08:31:38.958 align:start position:0%
so a lot of other states allow you to
 
08:31:41.430 --> 08:31:41.440 align:start position:0%
put in all all of that evidence
 
08:31:43.030 --> 08:31:43.040 align:start position:0%
uh i
 
08:31:44.708 --> 08:31:44.718 align:start position:0%
obviously there's a rumor that this bill
 
08:31:46.548 --> 08:31:46.558 align:start position:0%
is either going to be
 
08:31:48.868 --> 08:31:48.878 align:start position:0%
retained or itl to be reintroduced next
 
08:31:48.878 --> 08:31:49.910 align:start position:0%
retained or itl to be reintroduced next
year

08:31:49.910 --> 08:31:49.920 align:start position:0%
year
 
08:31:53.030 --> 08:31:53.040 align:start position:0%
i would definitely suggest in this case
 
08:31:55.430 --> 08:31:55.440 align:start position:0%
retaining the bill in order to allow
 
08:31:57.750 --> 08:31:57.760 align:start position:0%
members of the committee to sit on a
 
08:32:00.628 --> 08:32:00.638 align:start position:0%
subcommittee to
 
08:32:00.638 --> 08:32:01.830 align:start position:0%
subcommittee to
discuss

08:32:01.830 --> 08:32:01.840 align:start position:0%
discuss
 
08:32:03.750 --> 08:32:03.760 align:start position:0%
the the details of this as we've seen
 
08:32:07.590 --> 08:32:07.600 align:start position:0%
all day rsa 627 section 4 part 1
 
08:32:09.830 --> 08:32:09.840 align:start position:0%
non-deadly force part 2 deadly force and
 
08:32:11.670 --> 08:32:11.680 align:start position:0%
part 3 the exceptions
 
08:32:13.590 --> 08:32:13.600 align:start position:0%
have uh
 
08:32:15.190 --> 08:32:15.200 align:start position:0%
they open up a whole
 
08:32:16.548 --> 08:32:16.558 align:start position:0%
can of worms
 
08:32:19.350 --> 08:32:19.360 align:start position:0%
and that needs to be
 
08:32:21.030 --> 08:32:21.040 align:start position:0%
discussed and gone over and some of the
 
08:32:23.110 --> 08:32:23.120 align:start position:0%
new new case law and self-defense that's
 
08:32:24.468 --> 08:32:24.478 align:start position:0%
come out of the new hampshire supreme
 
08:32:24.478 --> 08:32:26.230 align:start position:0%
come out of the new hampshire supreme
court

08:32:26.230 --> 08:32:26.240 align:start position:0%
court

08:32:32.308 --> 08:32:32.318 align:start position:0%

and i am sort of brain dead i'm not sure
 
08:33:28.070 --> 08:33:28.080 align:start position:0%
i can uh listen to any more testimony or
 
08:33:30.788 --> 08:33:30.798 align:start position:0%
ask reasonable questions at this time
 
08:33:31.750 --> 08:33:31.760 align:start position:0%
i would
 
08:33:34.830 --> 08:33:34.840 align:start position:0%
like to see us adjourn this hearing and
 
08:33:34.840 --> 08:33:36.708 align:start position:0%
like to see us adjourn this hearing and
re-uh

08:33:36.708 --> 08:33:36.718 align:start position:0%

started sometime next week
 
08:33:46.628 --> 08:33:46.638 align:start position:0%
 
08:33:48.948 --> 08:33:48.958 align:start position:0%
point of order mr chairman
 
08:33:48.958 --> 08:33:50.628 align:start position:0%

yes
 
08:33:53.270 --> 08:33:53.280 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um mr chairman i
 
08:33:55.350 --> 08:33:55.360 align:start position:0%
mean we're all here
 
08:33:57.350 --> 08:33:57.360 align:start position:0%
uh people are testifying and i think
 
08:33:59.350 --> 08:33:59.360 align:start position:0%
there are other people willing to
 
08:34:02.308 --> 08:34:02.318 align:start position:0%
testify that has waited hours to speak
 
08:34:04.948 --> 08:34:04.958 align:start position:0%
on this bill i just
 
08:34:06.788 --> 08:34:06.798 align:start position:0%
you know the public you know just see it
 
08:34:09.030 --> 08:34:09.040 align:start position:0%
bad for us to end it i mean if a
 
08:34:11.190 --> 08:34:11.200 align:start position:0%
representative's brain is fried and he
 
08:34:13.350 --> 08:34:13.360 align:start position:0%
cannot go any further
 
08:34:15.590 --> 08:34:15.600 align:start position:0%
i i think it's okay if he
 
08:34:21.430 --> 08:34:21.440 align:start position:0%
 
08:34:23.670 --> 08:34:23.680 align:start position:0%
you know that we still continue with the
 
08:34:25.830 --> 08:34:25.840 align:start position:0%
ones that can function and i'm one of
 
08:34:25.840 --> 08:34:26.548 align:start position:0%
ones that can function and i'm one of
them

08:34:26.548 --> 08:34:26.558 align:start position:0%
them
 
08:34:26.558 --> 08:34:27.510 align:start position:0%
them
recognized

08:34:27.510 --> 08:34:27.520 align:start position:0%
recognized
 
08:34:44.308 --> 08:34:44.318 align:start position:0%
 
08:34:47.510 --> 08:34:47.520 align:start position:0%
his brain is frightened
 
08:34:49.430 --> 08:34:49.440 align:start position:0%
so well there may be a lot of that going
 
08:34:50.628 --> 08:34:50.638 align:start position:0%
around but i just
 
08:34:52.150 --> 08:34:52.160 align:start position:0%
representative i don't believe that
 
08:34:53.270 --> 08:34:53.280 align:start position:0%
that's a
 
08:34:58.830 --> 08:34:58.840 align:start position:0%
 
08:35:01.590 --> 08:35:01.600 align:start position:0%
i i'm saying it is the discretion of the
 
08:35:03.430 --> 08:35:03.440 align:start position:0%
chair if the chair wants to adjourn this
 
08:35:04.868 --> 08:35:04.878 align:start position:0%
until another time
 
08:35:10.070 --> 08:35:10.080 align:start position:0%
 
08:35:12.788 --> 08:35:12.798 align:start position:0%
is there a second for the motion
 
08:35:12.798 --> 08:35:17.430 align:start position:0%
is there a second for the motion
there's

08:35:17.430 --> 08:35:17.440 align:start position:0%
 
08:35:17.440 --> 08:35:18.150 align:start position:0%
 
well

08:35:18.150 --> 08:35:18.160 align:start position:0%
well
 
08:35:19.590 --> 08:35:19.600 align:start position:0%
we kind of discussed that right before
 
08:35:21.670 --> 08:35:21.680 align:start position:0%
we began the hearing
 
08:35:23.590 --> 08:35:23.600 align:start position:0%
and i will tell you that
 
08:35:24.948 --> 08:35:24.958 align:start position:0%
the consensus of everyone who was
 
08:35:24.958 --> 08:35:26.628 align:start position:0%
the consensus of everyone who was
speaking

08:35:26.628 --> 08:35:26.638 align:start position:0%
speaking
 
08:35:28.070 --> 08:35:28.080 align:start position:0%
my understanding was the people the
 
08:35:30.070 --> 08:35:30.080 align:start position:0%
members that didn't speak actually all
 
08:35:32.468 --> 08:35:32.478 align:start position:0%
were unanimous in wanting to continue
 
08:35:34.868 --> 08:35:34.878 align:start position:0%
out of respect members of the public
 
08:35:38.868 --> 08:35:38.878 align:start position:0%
i i do share the uh fatigue with
 
08:35:40.308 --> 08:35:40.318 align:start position:0%
you know that everyone's facing i'm sure
 
08:35:43.590 --> 08:35:43.600 align:start position:0%
we're all tired but what i would say is
 
08:35:45.590 --> 08:35:45.600 align:start position:0%
for the people here too that wish to
 
08:35:49.670 --> 08:35:49.680 align:start position:0%
 
08:35:57.350 --> 08:35:57.360 align:start position:0%
 
08:35:58.948 --> 08:35:58.958 align:start position:0%
respect to the members if we do spend an
 
08:36:01.110 --> 08:36:01.120 align:start position:0%
hour on questions this is this is like
 
08:36:02.788 --> 08:36:02.798 align:start position:0%
deja vu from the last time we stayed
 
08:36:02.798 --> 08:36:04.070 align:start position:0%
deja vu from the last time we stayed
afterwards

08:36:04.070 --> 08:36:04.080 align:start position:0%
afterwards
 
08:36:05.510 --> 08:36:05.520 align:start position:0%
so that was like
 
08:36:07.030 --> 08:36:07.040 align:start position:0%
let's just understand that if you're
 
08:36:09.830 --> 08:36:09.840 align:start position:0%
going to have 7 to 10 to 20 follow-up
 
08:36:09.840 --> 08:36:11.270 align:start position:0%
going to have 7 to 10 to 20 follow-up
questions

08:36:11.270 --> 08:36:11.280 align:start position:0%
questions
 
08:36:12.948 --> 08:36:12.958 align:start position:0%
that's not going to be very productive
 
08:36:12.958 --> 08:36:14.308 align:start position:0%
that's not going to be very productive
so

08:36:14.308 --> 08:36:14.318 align:start position:0%
so
 
08:36:16.230 --> 08:36:16.240 align:start position:0%
what i'm going to do is
 
08:36:17.830 --> 08:36:17.840 align:start position:0%
is there any representative do you have
 
08:36:23.030 --> 08:36:23.040 align:start position:0%
 
08:36:29.190 --> 08:36:29.200 align:start position:0%
 
08:36:31.190 --> 08:36:31.200 align:start position:0%
oh uh representative newman has a
 
08:36:35.510 --> 08:36:35.520 align:start position:0%
 
08:36:39.430 --> 08:36:39.440 align:start position:0%
 
08:36:42.388 --> 08:36:42.398 align:start position:0%

08:37:04.468 --> 08:37:04.478 align:start position:0%

been said i would just like to note that

08:37:16.868 --> 08:37:16.878 align:start position:0%
fbi supplementary homicide report 2014

homicides in which white shooters killed
 
08:37:29.430 --> 08:37:29.440 align:start position:0%
black victims are deemed justifiable
 
08:37:32.230 --> 08:37:32.240 align:start position:0%
five times more frequently than when the
 
08:37:34.948 --> 08:37:34.958 align:start position:0%

08:40:00.798 --> 08:40:01.750 align:start position:0%
i am not seeing
her

08:40:01.750 --> 08:40:01.760 align:start position:0%
her
 
08:40:04.868 --> 08:40:04.878 align:start position:0%
i do recall when uh ms romero testified
 
08:40:08.308 --> 08:40:08.318 align:start position:0%
she stated she was in opposition to 1 45
 
08:40:10.150 --> 08:40:10.160 align:start position:0%
and it's also listed
 
08:40:11.350 --> 08:40:11.360 align:start position:0%
on our list
 
08:40:11.360 --> 08:40:12.628 align:start position:0%
on our list
that

08:40:12.628 --> 08:40:12.638 align:start position:0%
that
 
08:40:15.590 --> 08:40:15.600 align:start position:0%
she is in opposition to 145 so
 
08:40:17.910 --> 08:40:17.920 align:start position:0%
except that she's not in the attendees
 
08:40:19.830 --> 08:40:19.840 align:start position:0%
it has been well documented that she
 
08:40:21.590 --> 08:40:21.600 align:start position:0%
opposes the bill
 
08:40:24.070 --> 08:40:24.080 align:start position:0%
hb 145
 
08:40:31.750 --> 08:40:31.760 align:start position:0%
 
08:40:34.388 --> 08:40:34.398 align:start position:0%
i will say looking
 
08:40:36.230 --> 08:40:36.240 align:start position:0%
what i just said about ms romero that he
 
08:40:37.510 --> 08:40:37.520 align:start position:0%
could make a similar
 
08:40:39.190 --> 08:40:39.200 align:start position:0%
identical statement to
 
08:40:39.200 --> 08:40:40.468 align:start position:0%
identical statement to
porn

08:40:40.468 --> 08:40:40.478 align:start position:0%
porn
 
08:40:43.590 --> 08:40:43.600 align:start position:0%
i do not see him either
 
08:40:45.190 --> 08:40:45.200 align:start position:0%
the record reflected he was also in
 
08:40:47.910 --> 08:40:47.920 align:start position:0%
opposition to this bill uh hb 145. he
 
08:40:50.468 --> 08:40:50.478 align:start position:0%
did say that during his testimony on
 
08:40:53.190 --> 08:40:53.200 align:start position:0%
the fireballs
 
08:40:56.388 --> 08:40:56.398 align:start position:0%
 
08:40:56.398 --> 08:40:58.388 align:start position:0%
 
yep

08:40:58.388 --> 08:40:58.398 align:start position:0%
yep
 
08:41:01.750 --> 08:41:01.760 align:start position:0%
that's a new new one we got one
 
08:41:04.468 --> 08:41:04.478 align:start position:0%
yeah bill kingston here
 
08:41:05.910 --> 08:41:05.920 align:start position:0%
can you hear me
 
08:41:07.190 --> 08:41:07.200 align:start position:0%
yes we can
 
08:41:07.200 --> 08:41:08.388 align:start position:0%
yes we can
okay

08:41:08.388 --> 08:41:08.398 align:start position:0%
okay
 
08:41:10.468 --> 08:41:10.478 align:start position:0%
mr chairman members of the committee i'm
 
08:41:12.628 --> 08:41:12.638 align:start position:0%
bill kingston from newcastle i'm
 
08:41:15.350 --> 08:41:15.360 align:start position:0%
speaking for myself and an opposition i
 
08:41:16.868 --> 08:41:16.878 align:start position:0%
am a gun owner and a marine corps
 
08:41:19.190 --> 08:41:19.200 align:start position:0%
veteran with combat experience and i
 
08:41:21.110 --> 08:41:21.120 align:start position:0%
know what it is like to be in a deadly
 
08:41:21.120 --> 08:41:22.868 align:start position:0%
know what it is like to be in a deadly
situation

08:41:22.868 --> 08:41:22.878 align:start position:0%
situation
 
08:41:24.308 --> 08:41:24.318 align:start position:0%
ladies and gentlemen whatever happened
 
08:41:26.548 --> 08:41:26.558 align:start position:0%
to thou shalt not kill
 
08:41:28.150 --> 08:41:28.160 align:start position:0%
this bill aims to repeal the
 
08:41:30.308 --> 08:41:30.318 align:start position:0%
long-standing legal principle that use
 
08:41:33.590 --> 08:41:33.600 align:start position:0%
of deadly force has to be justifiable
 
08:41:35.510 --> 08:41:35.520 align:start position:0%
this is way over the top even for the
 
08:41:36.948 --> 08:41:36.958 align:start position:0%
gun lobby
 
08:41:38.548 --> 08:41:38.558 align:start position:0%
i thought this committee's purpose was
 
08:41:40.070 --> 08:41:40.080 align:start position:0%
public safety
 
08:41:41.910 --> 08:41:41.920 align:start position:0%
there's public knowledge that in every
 
08:41:43.590 --> 08:41:43.600 align:start position:0%
state that enacted staying your ground
 
08:41:46.708 --> 08:41:46.718 align:start position:0%
legislation crime did not decrease the
 
08:41:48.230 --> 08:41:48.240 align:start position:0%
opposite happened
 
08:41:50.788 --> 08:41:50.798 align:start position:0%
these laws encouraged the escalation of
 
08:41:50.798 --> 08:41:51.830 align:start position:0%
these laws encouraged the escalation of
violence

08:41:51.830 --> 08:41:51.840 align:start position:0%
violence
 
08:41:54.388 --> 08:41:54.398 align:start position:0%
in everyday conflicts resulting in more
 
08:41:54.398 --> 08:41:55.990 align:start position:0%
in everyday conflicts resulting in more
shootings

08:41:55.990 --> 08:41:56.000 align:start position:0%
shootings
 
08:41:57.430 --> 08:41:57.440 align:start position:0%
prior to the enactment of this
 
08:41:59.910 --> 08:41:59.920 align:start position:0%
legislation a person who shot another
 
08:42:02.628 --> 08:42:02.638 align:start position:0%
person because of a perceived threat
 
08:42:05.030 --> 08:42:05.040 align:start position:0%
would be considered to be paranoid and
 
08:42:06.788 --> 08:42:06.798 align:start position:0%
get treated for a dangerous mental
 
08:42:06.798 --> 08:42:07.830 align:start position:0%
get treated for a dangerous mental
illness

08:42:07.830 --> 08:42:07.840 align:start position:0%
illness
 
08:42:09.990 --> 08:42:10.000 align:start position:0%
now that kind of conduct is permitted
 
08:42:11.750 --> 08:42:11.760 align:start position:0%
and people are dying
 
08:42:13.190 --> 08:42:13.200 align:start position:0%
in conclusion
 
08:42:15.350 --> 08:42:15.360 align:start position:0%
as a marine corps combat veteran i can
 
08:42:17.910 --> 08:42:17.920 align:start position:0%
assure you that even in combat it makes
 
08:42:20.868 --> 08:42:20.878 align:start position:0%
sense sometimes to simply retreat
 
08:42:22.388 --> 08:42:22.398 align:start position:0%
i respectfully submit that this
 
08:42:24.788 --> 08:42:24.798 align:start position:0%
committee should bear that in mind when
 
08:42:26.548 --> 08:42:26.558 align:start position:0%
considering whether it makes sense to
 
08:42:40.070 --> 08:42:40.080 align:start position:0%
 
08:42:41.670 --> 08:42:41.680 align:start position:0%
thank you mr kingston for your testimony
 
08:42:43.830 --> 08:42:43.840 align:start position:0%
and your patience you've also been with
 
08:42:45.830 --> 08:42:45.840 align:start position:0%
us all day so we uh we thank you for
 
08:42:45.840 --> 08:42:56.628 align:start position:0%
us all day so we uh we thank you for
that

08:42:56.628 --> 08:42:56.638 align:start position:0%
 
08:42:59.430 --> 08:42:59.440 align:start position:0%
 
08:43:01.030 --> 08:43:01.040 align:start position:0%
i see no questions from mr kingston
 
08:43:03.830 --> 08:43:03.840 align:start position:0%
though the witness is excluded
 
08:43:06.468 --> 08:43:06.478 align:start position:0%
thank you i won't repeat my credentials
 
08:43:08.468 --> 08:43:08.478 align:start position:0%
even though it's been a long day i'm i'm
 
08:43:10.150 --> 08:43:10.160 align:start position:0%
sure enough people remember i'm a
 
08:43:11.990 --> 08:43:12.000 align:start position:0%
practicing attorney and in case i didn't
 
08:43:14.308 --> 08:43:14.318 align:start position:0%
say so i'm speaking for myself and i'm
 
08:43:16.788 --> 08:43:16.798 align:start position:0%
out of concord new hampshire
 
08:43:20.070 --> 08:43:20.080 align:start position:0%
and i would ask that you itl this bill i
 
08:43:23.430 --> 08:43:23.440 align:start position:0%
am in support of the concept of this
 
08:43:26.388 --> 08:43:26.398 align:start position:0%
bill the concept is great here's the
 
08:43:26.398 --> 08:43:27.590 align:start position:0%
bill the concept is great here's the
problem

08:43:27.590 --> 08:43:27.600 align:start position:0%
problem
 
08:43:30.788 --> 08:43:30.798 align:start position:0%
this bill has been copied verbatim
 
08:43:33.430 --> 08:43:33.440 align:start position:0%
from a utah code section
 
08:43:35.990 --> 08:43:36.000 align:start position:0%
which is
 
08:43:36.000 --> 08:43:39.750 align:start position:0%
which is
7624

08:43:39.750 --> 08:43:39.760 align:start position:0%
 
08:43:42.230 --> 08:43:42.240 align:start position:0%
and here's the problem i just saw this
 
08:43:44.070 --> 08:43:44.080 align:start position:0%
bill yesterday
 
08:43:47.510 --> 08:43:47.520 align:start position:0%
and what we have is not perfect and it
 
08:43:49.990 --> 08:43:50.000 align:start position:0%
certainly needs to be fixed at some time
 
08:43:52.308 --> 08:43:52.318 align:start position:0%
but this i do not believe is the
 
08:43:54.628 --> 08:43:54.638 align:start position:0%
solution for several reasons
 
08:43:56.548 --> 08:43:56.558 align:start position:0%
number one
 
08:43:59.030 --> 08:43:59.040 align:start position:0%
it was the utah bill was most recently
 
08:44:01.590 --> 08:44:01.600 align:start position:0%
tweaked in 2019
 
08:44:04.230 --> 08:44:04.240 align:start position:0%
giving my general experience from date
 
08:44:07.110 --> 08:44:07.120 align:start position:0%
of charge till trial is one to two years
 
08:44:08.788 --> 08:44:08.798 align:start position:0%
there hasn't been enough experience with
 
08:44:11.030 --> 08:44:11.040 align:start position:0%
the tweaks of this bill to look at it
 
08:44:12.468 --> 08:44:12.478 align:start position:0%
but if you look at what's called the
 
08:44:14.308 --> 08:44:14.318 align:start position:0%
shepherds report and for those of you
 
08:44:16.388 --> 08:44:16.398 align:start position:0%
who don't know what it is cases are that
 
08:44:18.070 --> 08:44:18.080 align:start position:0%
are reported through the courts meaning
 
08:44:19.910 --> 08:44:19.920 align:start position:0%
if someone's convicted and they appeal
 
08:44:22.150 --> 08:44:22.160 align:start position:0%
to the government appeals
 
08:44:25.350 --> 08:44:25.360 align:start position:0%
the conviction or the acquittal
 
08:44:27.830 --> 08:44:27.840 align:start position:0%
those cases are categorized by a service
 
08:44:30.070 --> 08:44:30.080 align:start position:0%
called shepherds and so they take all
 
08:44:31.990 --> 08:44:32.000 align:start position:0%
the cases in the country and they list
 
08:44:35.350 --> 08:44:35.360 align:start position:0%
them if they pertain to a particular
 
08:44:38.230 --> 08:44:38.240 align:start position:0%
phrase or a particular law there have
 
08:44:42.388 --> 08:44:42.398 align:start position:0%
been 95 reported cases with the utah
 
08:44:42.398 --> 08:44:43.510 align:start position:0%
been 95 reported cases with the utah
code

08:44:43.510 --> 08:44:43.520 align:start position:0%
code
 
08:44:46.308 --> 08:44:46.318 align:start position:0%
that means 95 people have been convicted
 
08:44:48.230 --> 08:44:48.240 align:start position:0%
and when you use the word self-defense
 
08:44:50.388 --> 08:44:50.398 align:start position:0%
in there you get 90 of them
 
08:44:52.788 --> 08:44:52.798 align:start position:0%
and so the question is is this law
 
08:44:54.548 --> 08:44:54.558 align:start position:0%
working in utah and quite frankly i
 
08:44:57.350 --> 08:44:57.360 align:start position:0%
don't know because reading 90 cases when
 
08:44:59.270 --> 08:44:59.280 align:start position:0%
i was given this bill late yesterday
 
08:45:02.230 --> 08:45:02.240 align:start position:0%
afternoon and it's just not possible
 
08:45:05.190 --> 08:45:05.200 align:start position:0%
to go into this and put something forth
 
08:45:07.350 --> 08:45:07.360 align:start position:0%
like this that truly hasn't been vetted
 
08:45:09.270 --> 08:45:09.280 align:start position:0%
and looked at and see if it's for good
 
08:45:12.070 --> 08:45:12.080 align:start position:0%
or evil is quite frankly reckless
 
08:45:13.910 --> 08:45:13.920 align:start position:0%
i would respectfully say it should be
 
08:45:18.868 --> 08:45:18.878 align:start position:0%
 
08:45:21.030 --> 08:45:21.040 align:start position:0%
steve we appreciate your testimony uh
 
08:45:24.468 --> 08:45:24.478 align:start position:0%
you have exceeded the two minutes and uh
 
08:45:24.478 --> 08:45:26.468 align:start position:0%
you have exceeded the two minutes and uh
it's

08:45:26.468 --> 08:45:26.478 align:start position:0%
it's
 
08:45:28.628 --> 08:45:28.638 align:start position:0%
almost six o'clock so we're gonna
 
08:45:37.830 --> 08:45:37.840 align:start position:0%
 
08:45:40.150 --> 08:45:40.160 align:start position:0%
the bottom line is that this law is
 
08:45:42.548 --> 08:45:42.558 align:start position:0%
quite frankly too complex and enters
 
08:45:45.030 --> 08:45:45.040 align:start position:0%
into a lot more fact-finding which will
 
08:45:46.948 --> 08:45:46.958 align:start position:0%
make it more difficult and more likely a
 
08:45:49.510 --> 08:45:49.520 align:start position:0%
person may be convicted and it really
 
08:45:51.830 --> 08:45:51.840 align:start position:0%
leaves the instructions up to a judge so
 
08:45:53.430 --> 08:45:53.440 align:start position:0%
again i respectfully agree with the
 
08:45:56.070 --> 08:45:56.080 align:start position:0%
concept completely but disagree with
 
08:45:58.150 --> 08:45:58.160 align:start position:0%
this solution
 
08:46:01.590 --> 08:46:01.600 align:start position:0%
 
08:46:05.110 --> 08:46:05.120 align:start position:0%
 
08:46:07.510 --> 08:46:07.520 align:start position:0%
seeing no hands raised
 
08:46:07.520 --> 08:46:08.388 align:start position:0%
seeing no hands raised
the

08:46:08.388 --> 08:46:08.398 align:start position:0%
the
 
08:46:20.868 --> 08:46:20.878 align:start position:0%
 
08:46:20.878 --> 08:46:26.308 align:start position:0%
 
jr

08:46:26.308 --> 08:46:26.318 align:start position:0%
 
08:46:27.670 --> 08:46:27.680 align:start position:0%
i would ask that members of the public
 
08:46:29.750 --> 08:46:29.760 align:start position:0%
who do wish to testify if they if they
 
08:46:31.590 --> 08:46:31.600 align:start position:0%
do raise their hand
 
08:46:33.430 --> 08:46:33.440 align:start position:0%
electronically it would be very helpful
 
08:46:34.788 --> 08:46:34.798 align:start position:0%
for the committee members balance the
 
08:46:37.190 --> 08:46:37.200 align:start position:0%
schedule if they raise their hand with
 
08:46:39.030 --> 08:46:39.040 align:start position:0%
the beginning of the hearing
 
08:46:40.868 --> 08:46:40.878 align:start position:0%
so it just would be very helpful to all
 
08:46:44.708 --> 08:46:44.718 align:start position:0%
 
08:46:46.788 --> 08:46:46.798 align:start position:0%
can you hear me
 
08:46:48.708 --> 08:46:48.718 align:start position:0%
yes i can okay
 
08:46:50.308 --> 08:46:50.318 align:start position:0%
thank you i'll make my testimony short
 
08:46:52.830 --> 08:46:52.840 align:start position:0%
we've had a number of bills today in the
 
08:46:55.670 --> 08:46:55.680 align:start position:0%
same regarding the same material for the
 
08:46:58.230 --> 08:46:58.240 align:start position:0%
record j.r hull former state rep
 
08:47:00.230 --> 08:47:00.240 align:start position:0%

08:47:01.840 --> 08:47:03.110 align:start position:0%

coalition

08:47:03.110 --> 08:47:03.120 align:start position:0%
coalition
 
08:47:05.750 --> 08:47:05.760 align:start position:0%
i like this bill in concept i think the
 
08:47:07.910 --> 08:47:07.920 align:start position:0%
language probably needs tweak given some
 
08:47:10.230 --> 08:47:10.240 align:start position:0%
of the other bills this year i would
 
08:47:11.830 --> 08:47:11.840 align:start position:0%
advocate that we pass the other ones and
 
08:47:13.430 --> 08:47:13.440 align:start position:0%
retain this one so we can work on the
 
08:47:15.910 --> 08:47:15.920 align:start position:0%
language it's a good idea but still need
 
08:47:17.510 --> 08:47:17.520 align:start position:0%
some tweaking
 
08:47:20.230 --> 08:47:20.240 align:start position:0%
um but i i and i'll send this to the
 
08:47:22.868 --> 08:47:22.878 align:start position:0%
committee i've pulled the fbi violent
 
08:47:24.150 --> 08:47:24.160 align:start position:0%
crime data
 
08:47:26.628 --> 08:47:26.638 align:start position:0%
for new hampshire versus the country
 
08:47:28.948 --> 08:47:28.958 align:start position:0%
and i want everybody on on the phone to
 
08:47:28.958 --> 08:47:30.070 align:start position:0%
and i want everybody on on the phone to
realize

08:47:30.070 --> 08:47:30.080 align:start position:0%
realize
 
08:47:31.910 --> 08:47:31.920 align:start position:0%
the peak of the violent crime in new
 
08:47:35.510 --> 08:47:35.520 align:start position:0%
hampshire was the 2011 time period
 
08:47:38.628 --> 08:47:38.638 align:start position:0%
and after passing this law we have seen
 
08:47:40.708 --> 08:47:40.718 align:start position:0%
a gradual decrease in violent crime
 
08:47:42.628 --> 08:47:42.638 align:start position:0%
meaning new hampshire has gotten safer
 
08:47:44.788 --> 08:47:44.798 align:start position:0%
over the last 10 years
 
08:47:47.750 --> 08:47:47.760 align:start position:0%
this is not me biasing data this is the
 
08:47:50.468 --> 08:47:50.478 align:start position:0%
fbi uniform crime data report
 
08:47:51.750 --> 08:47:51.760 align:start position:0%
so i think it's important that we
 
08:47:53.750 --> 08:47:53.760 align:start position:0%
realize that the laws that we passed in
 
08:47:56.468 --> 08:47:56.478 align:start position:0%
2011 have made new hampshire a safer
 
08:48:11.910 --> 08:48:11.920 align:start position:0%
 
08:48:11.920 --> 08:48:12.948 align:start position:0%
 
yes

08:48:12.948 --> 08:48:12.958 align:start position:0%
yes
 
08:48:12.958 --> 08:48:14.868 align:start position:0%
yes
yes

08:48:14.868 --> 08:48:14.878 align:start position:0%
yes
 
08:48:16.830 --> 08:48:16.840 align:start position:0%
we may have lost
 
08:48:20.708 --> 08:48:20.718 align:start position:0%
uh oh yeah he's right off the radar
 
08:48:23.110 --> 08:48:23.120 align:start position:0%
mr chairman it's all right
 
08:48:25.110 --> 08:48:25.120 align:start position:0%
i've got a phone bill
 
08:48:29.030 --> 08:48:29.040 align:start position:0%
 
08:48:33.190 --> 08:48:33.200 align:start position:0%
 
08:48:35.910 --> 08:48:35.920 align:start position:0%
good afternoon mr chairman um once again
 
08:48:37.910 --> 08:48:37.920 align:start position:0%
alan rice a resident of bedford new
 
08:48:37.920 --> 08:48:38.948 align:start position:0%
alan rice a resident of bedford new
hampshire

08:48:38.948 --> 08:48:38.958 align:start position:0%

08:48:41.990 --> 08:48:42.000 align:start position:0%
state director for gun owners of america
 
08:48:44.788 --> 08:48:44.798 align:start position:0%
we are opposed to this bill uh the
 
08:48:48.788 --> 08:48:48.798 align:start position:0%
original bill as introduced
 
08:48:51.030 --> 08:48:51.040 align:start position:0%
yes it repeals
 
08:48:52.628 --> 08:48:52.638 align:start position:0%
the person's
 
08:48:54.468 --> 08:48:54.478 align:start position:0%
requirement to retreat
 
08:48:56.548 --> 08:48:56.558 align:start position:0%
but it also repeals all the exceptions
 
08:48:58.868 --> 08:48:58.878 align:start position:0%
to retreat that go along with it and
 
08:49:00.868 --> 08:49:00.878 align:start position:0%
therefore the courts would likely fall
 
08:49:03.510 --> 08:49:03.520 align:start position:0%
back on the common law which requires a
 
08:49:07.350 --> 08:49:07.360 align:start position:0%
defender to avoid a conflict at all cost
 
08:49:09.910 --> 08:49:09.920 align:start position:0%
the amendment that i was provided a copy
 
08:49:12.388 --> 08:49:12.398 align:start position:0%
by attorney dean uh
 
08:49:13.990 --> 08:49:14.000 align:start position:0%
we haven't had a chance to review it
 
08:49:15.430 --> 08:49:15.440 align:start position:0%
with our council
 
08:49:18.548 --> 08:49:18.558 align:start position:0%
it seems long complex and a carbon copy
 
08:49:20.468 --> 08:49:20.478 align:start position:0%
of laws in other states
 
08:49:22.150 --> 08:49:22.160 align:start position:0%
that could be impacted by court
 
08:49:23.990 --> 08:49:24.000 align:start position:0%
decisions and in light of the other
 
08:49:26.788 --> 08:49:26.798 align:start position:0%
bills that on this topic that your
 
08:49:29.990 --> 08:49:30.000 align:start position:0%
committee is uh considering
 
08:49:31.670 --> 08:49:31.680 align:start position:0%
we would respectfully request that you
 
08:49:34.230 --> 08:49:34.240 align:start position:0%
vote house bill 145 in expedient to
 
08:49:34.240 --> 08:49:39.030 align:start position:0%
vote house bill 145 in expedient to

thank you for your testimony
 
08:49:43.190 --> 08:49:43.200 align:start position:0%
i see seeing no hands raised the witness
 
08:49:46.070 --> 08:49:46.080 align:start position:0%
 
08:49:47.910 --> 08:49:47.920 align:start position:0%
this is
 
08:49:50.468 --> 08:49:50.478 align:start position:0%
dr joe hannan
 
08:49:54.468 --> 08:49:54.478 align:start position:0%
 
08:49:57.350 --> 08:49:57.360 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry um i know it's late joe hannan
 
08:49:58.948 --> 08:49:58.958 align:start position:0%
vice president for
 
08:50:00.948 --> 08:50:00.958 align:start position:0%
uh gun owners of new hampshire
 
08:50:03.750 --> 08:50:03.760 align:start position:0%
i i don't want to get
 
08:50:05.110 --> 08:50:05.120 align:start position:0%
too involved in testimony on this
 
08:50:06.708 --> 08:50:06.718 align:start position:0%
because it's already most of what i was
 
08:50:08.788 --> 08:50:08.798 align:start position:0%
going to say has already been said by
 
08:50:10.070 --> 08:50:10.080 align:start position:0%

and alan rice uh it's well intended the
 
08:50:15.190 --> 08:50:15.200 align:start position:0%
bill i think um
 
08:50:17.750 --> 08:50:17.760 align:start position:0%
we need to spend more time uh talking
 
08:50:20.628 --> 08:50:20.638 align:start position:0%
about it as it's written we oppose it
 
08:50:23.510 --> 08:50:23.520 align:start position:0%
and if i'm incorrect didn't these prime
 
08:50:25.190 --> 08:50:25.200 align:start position:0%
sponsors bill ask for it to be retained
 
08:50:26.868 --> 08:50:26.878 align:start position:0%
for more work to be done and if that's
 
08:50:32.708 --> 08:50:32.718 align:start position:0%
 
08:50:34.468 --> 08:50:34.478 align:start position:0%

08:50:56.468 --> 08:50:56.478 align:start position:0%

speaking for myself and uh the gun

um
 
08:51:12.548 --> 08:51:12.558 align:start position:0%
uh speaking against hp 145
 
08:51:18.628 --> 08:51:18.638 align:start position:0%
 
08:51:21.830 --> 08:51:21.840 align:start position:0%
it simply puts guns and um other deadly
 
08:51:23.430 --> 08:51:23.440 align:start position:0%
weapons in people's hands and gives them
 
08:51:24.948 --> 08:51:24.958 align:start position:0%
permission to shoot people without
 
08:51:26.628 --> 08:51:26.638 align:start position:0%
imposing any obligation or
 
08:51:28.628 --> 08:51:28.638 align:start position:0%
responsibility to respect the lives of
 
08:51:31.030 --> 08:51:31.040 align:start position:0%
their fellow human beings at all
 
08:51:33.990 --> 08:51:34.000 align:start position:0%
and much as um don't really like the
 
08:51:38.270 --> 08:51:38.280 align:start position:0%
stand your ground laws um at least in
 
08:51:41.030 --> 08:51:41.040 align:start position:0%
627.43 there is at least some effort to
 
08:51:43.350 --> 08:51:43.360 align:start position:0%
recognize that before using deadly force
 
08:51:45.830 --> 08:51:45.840 align:start position:0%
on another person individuals need to
 
08:51:47.110 --> 08:51:47.120 align:start position:0%
try to make sure that there aren't
 
08:51:49.830 --> 08:51:49.840 align:start position:0%
alternatives to killing think before you
 
08:51:52.150 --> 08:51:52.160 align:start position:0%
shoot think before you end someone's
 
08:51:52.160 --> 08:51:53.430 align:start position:0%
shoot think before you end someone's
life

08:51:53.430 --> 08:51:53.440 align:start position:0%
life
 
08:51:55.830 --> 08:51:55.840 align:start position:0%
you know reality isn't rambo or the wild
 
08:51:55.840 --> 08:51:56.948 align:start position:0%
you know reality isn't rambo or the wild
west

08:51:56.948 --> 08:51:56.958 align:start position:0%
west
 
08:51:58.948 --> 08:51:58.958 align:start position:0%
in real life you take a moment or even a
 
08:52:00.548 --> 08:52:00.558 align:start position:0%
second if you have it and make sure that
 
08:52:02.308 --> 08:52:02.318 align:start position:0%
you don't have the option of retreat or
 
08:52:03.910 --> 08:52:03.920 align:start position:0%
handing over a piece of property or
 
08:52:05.190 --> 08:52:05.200 align:start position:0%
something like that before you kill
 
08:52:05.200 --> 08:52:06.150 align:start position:0%
something like that before you kill
someone

08:52:06.150 --> 08:52:06.160 align:start position:0%
someone
 
08:52:09.350 --> 08:52:09.360 align:start position:0%
but hp 145 would take away that civic
 
08:52:11.510 --> 08:52:11.520 align:start position:0%
and moral obligation
 
08:52:13.190 --> 08:52:13.200 align:start position:0%
it says if you feel threatened go ahead
 
08:52:15.830 --> 08:52:15.840 align:start position:0%
and shoot and ask the questions later
 
08:52:17.590 --> 08:52:17.600 align:start position:0%
there's no accountability if this law is
 
08:52:19.750 --> 08:52:19.760 align:start position:0%
passed because you the shooter have no
 
08:52:21.990 --> 08:52:22.000 align:start position:0%
obligation to think about that
 
08:52:23.510 --> 08:52:23.520 align:start position:0%
to think about that feeling of being
 
08:52:23.520 --> 08:52:24.948 align:start position:0%
to think about that feeling of being
threatened

08:52:24.948 --> 08:52:24.958 align:start position:0%
threatened
 
08:52:27.430 --> 08:52:27.440 align:start position:0%
you felt you shot someone is dead a
 
08:52:29.350 --> 08:52:29.360 align:start position:0%
family and a community is devastated but
 
08:52:32.070 --> 08:52:32.080 align:start position:0%
you go on with your life as before
 
08:52:34.070 --> 08:52:34.080 align:start position:0%
i'm not saying that finding yourself in
 
08:52:35.750 --> 08:52:35.760 align:start position:0%
a scary or a potentially violent
 
08:52:37.990 --> 08:52:38.000 align:start position:0%
situation doesn't happen of course it
 
08:52:41.270 --> 08:52:41.280 align:start position:0%
does and genuine mistakes occur as well
 
08:52:41.280 --> 08:52:41.990 align:start position:0%
does and genuine mistakes occur as well
but

08:52:41.990 --> 08:52:42.000 align:start position:0%
but
 
08:52:43.910 --> 08:52:43.920 align:start position:0%
as much as i dislike the current law and
 
08:52:45.830 --> 08:52:45.840 align:start position:0%
i think it needs amelioration
 
08:52:48.230 --> 08:52:48.240 align:start position:0%
it at least attempts to strike a balance
 
08:52:50.070 --> 08:52:50.080 align:start position:0%
between interests of the various parties
 
08:52:51.750 --> 08:52:51.760 align:start position:0%
in a situation
 
08:52:54.388 --> 08:52:54.398 align:start position:0%
hp 145 would wipe all of that away and
 
08:52:55.990 --> 08:52:56.000 align:start position:0%
ensure that the shooter is always right
 
08:52:57.510 --> 08:52:57.520 align:start position:0%
even when he or she is the one who
 
08:53:00.150 --> 08:53:00.160 align:start position:0%
starts the altercation and that's not
 
08:53:04.468 --> 08:53:04.478 align:start position:0%
balance it's a shooter's fantasy so
 
08:53:04.478 --> 08:53:05.750 align:start position:0%
balance it's a shooter's fantasy so
uh

08:53:05.750 --> 08:53:05.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
08:53:06.868 --> 08:53:06.878 align:start position:0%
ms burke i want to thank you for your
 
08:53:09.190 --> 08:53:09.200 align:start position:0%
