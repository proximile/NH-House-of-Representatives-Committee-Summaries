00:08:09.110 --> 00:08:09.120 align:start position:0%
okay all right good morning everyone
 
00:08:13.430 --> 00:08:13.440 align:start position:0%
today we will focus entirely on
 
00:08:15.710 --> 00:08:15.720 align:start position:0%
Revenue estimates and hopefully we can
 
00:08:18.350 --> 00:08:18.360 align:start position:0%
make some decisions along the way we do
 
00:08:20.570 --> 00:08:20.580 align:start position:0%
have a couple of presentations to help
 
00:08:23.210 --> 00:08:23.220 align:start position:0%
us get better informed first on the
 
00:08:26.150 --> 00:08:26.160 align:start position:0%
docket is James Gary is that husband uh
 
00:08:40.790 --> 00:08:40.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:43.130 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

00:08:43.130 --> 00:08:43.140 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:08:44.269 --> 00:08:44.279 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:08:46.730 --> 00:08:46.740 align:start position:0%
good morning Madam chair and members of
 
00:08:49.009 --> 00:08:49.019 align:start position:0%
the committee my name is James Gary and
 
00:08:51.590 --> 00:08:51.600 align:start position:0%
I am the state budget director I am here
 
00:08:52.850 --> 00:08:52.860 align:start position:0%
to present the governor's Revenue
 
00:08:55.130 --> 00:08:55.140 align:start position:0%
projections for fiscal year 24 and
 
00:08:58.130 --> 00:08:58.140 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 25 for our budget of course
 
00:09:00.530 --> 00:09:00.540 align:start position:0%
in order to do that we first have to
 
00:09:02.690 --> 00:09:02.700 align:start position:0%
project the remaining five months of
 
00:09:05.449 --> 00:09:05.459 align:start position:0%
revenues for fiscal year 23. so I'm
 
00:09:07.070 --> 00:09:07.080 align:start position:0%
going to begin talking about the
 
00:09:08.990 --> 00:09:09.000 align:start position:0%
remainder of fiscal year 23 and then get
 
00:09:10.550 --> 00:09:10.560 align:start position:0%
into the numbers for the upcoming
 
00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:12.050 align:start position:0%
into the numbers for the upcoming
biennium

00:09:12.050 --> 00:09:12.060 align:start position:0%
biennium
 
00:09:13.970 --> 00:09:13.980 align:start position:0%
I'm often asked how you come up with
 
00:09:17.090 --> 00:09:17.100 align:start position:0%
your numbers for Revenue projections did
 
00:09:19.670 --> 00:09:19.680 align:start position:0%
you use a particular model did you use a
 
00:09:21.290 --> 00:09:21.300 align:start position:0%
straight line or moving average did you
 
00:09:23.150 --> 00:09:23.160 align:start position:0%
use a simple linear regression or a
 
00:09:25.130 --> 00:09:25.140 align:start position:0%
multiple linear regression
 
00:09:26.690 --> 00:09:26.700 align:start position:0%
well I can answer all those put all
 
00:09:28.190 --> 00:09:28.200 align:start position:0%
those questions to bed and answer for
 
00:09:30.889 --> 00:09:30.899 align:start position:0%
those today how we came up with our
 
00:09:36.590 --> 00:09:36.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:38.810 --> 00:09:38.820 align:start position:0%
stalling may be a bit of a harsh word
 
00:09:40.430 --> 00:09:40.440 align:start position:0%
understanding like in the old days when
 
00:09:42.230 --> 00:09:42.240 align:start position:0%
someone would steal someone else's music
 
00:09:44.810 --> 00:09:44.820 align:start position:0%
it was theft now it's called sampling so
 
00:09:47.509 --> 00:09:47.519 align:start position:0%
in that line we sampled the dra Lottery
 
00:09:51.250 --> 00:09:51.260 align:start position:0%
liquor safety and fishing game revenues
 
00:09:54.710 --> 00:09:54.720 align:start position:0%
and this was really a team effort a team
 
00:09:57.350 --> 00:09:57.360 align:start position:0%
theft between myself and administrative
 
00:09:59.509 --> 00:09:59.519 align:start position:0%
Services together we put together these
 
00:10:01.790 --> 00:10:01.800 align:start position:0%
the these forecasts and then presented
 
00:10:03.710 --> 00:10:03.720 align:start position:0%
to the to the governor who signed off on
 
00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:04.449 align:start position:0%
to the to the governor who signed off on
them

00:10:04.449 --> 00:10:04.459 align:start position:0%
them
 
00:10:07.730 --> 00:10:07.740 align:start position:0%
uh and the reason we did that is because
 
00:10:11.509 --> 00:10:11.519 align:start position:0%
from the outset we realized no matter uh
 
00:10:14.870 --> 00:10:14.880 align:start position:0%
how good we think we are at projecting
 
00:10:17.269 --> 00:10:17.279 align:start position:0%
revenues or knowing these uh taxes
 
00:10:19.490 --> 00:10:19.500 align:start position:0%
inside and out we are not better than
 
00:10:20.930 --> 00:10:20.940 align:start position:0%
the people who deal with them on a
 
00:10:23.449 --> 00:10:23.459 align:start position:0%
day-to-day basis therefore
 
00:10:25.310 --> 00:10:25.320 align:start position:0%
we relied on the Departments and their
 
00:10:27.530 --> 00:10:27.540 align:start position:0%
expertise to provide the revenue
 
00:10:29.990 --> 00:10:30.000 align:start position:0%
forecasts and then we put them through a
 
00:10:32.449 --> 00:10:32.459 align:start position:0%
reasonability filter to see if they made
 
00:10:35.210 --> 00:10:35.220 align:start position:0%
sense and we did not just begrudgingly
 
00:10:37.310 --> 00:10:37.320 align:start position:0%
accept their numbers we agree with their
 
00:10:40.430 --> 00:10:40.440 align:start position:0%
numbers they were reasonable and believe
 
00:10:44.030 --> 00:10:44.040 align:start position:0%
they can and should be defended
 
00:10:46.370 --> 00:10:46.380 align:start position:0%
when commissioner stepp of the dra who's
 
00:10:47.350 --> 00:10:47.360 align:start position:0%
here today
 
00:10:50.210 --> 00:10:50.220 align:start position:0%
uh started off with testimony in front
 
00:10:53.769 --> 00:10:53.779 align:start position:0%
of the committee I believe she said uh
 
00:10:56.269 --> 00:10:56.279 align:start position:0%
and caution you that these numbers are
 
00:10:59.210 --> 00:10:59.220 align:start position:0%
wrong I concur her numbers and the
 
00:11:01.490 --> 00:11:01.500 align:start position:0%
numbers I'm presenting to hear to hear
 
00:11:04.009 --> 00:11:04.019 align:start position:0%
to you today are most certainly wrong I
 
00:11:06.829 --> 00:11:06.839 align:start position:0%
say that because they always are and
 
00:11:09.290 --> 00:11:09.300 align:start position:0%
when I say always I mean always
 
00:11:11.690 --> 00:11:11.700 align:start position:0%
before I joined the dra my past life was
 
00:11:13.550 --> 00:11:13.560 align:start position:0%
as a Municipal Credit analyst and for
 
00:11:15.769 --> 00:11:15.779 align:start position:0%
over 30 years I've reviewed thousands
 
00:11:18.230 --> 00:11:18.240 align:start position:0%
tens of thousands of Revenue projections
 
00:11:20.090 --> 00:11:20.100 align:start position:0%
for States cities towns School District
 
00:11:22.130 --> 00:11:22.140 align:start position:0%
toll roads and other special Revenue
 
00:11:24.170 --> 00:11:24.180 align:start position:0%
projects and they all have one thing in
 
00:11:27.110 --> 00:11:27.120 align:start position:0%
common they were wrong every single one
 
00:11:29.210 --> 00:11:29.220 align:start position:0%
of them I say this to emphasize the
 
00:11:30.889 --> 00:11:30.899 align:start position:0%
point that we as a team and myself
 
00:11:33.650 --> 00:11:33.660 align:start position:0%
sitting here here before you today do
 
00:11:35.990 --> 00:11:36.000 align:start position:0%
not have a crystal ball that we can
 
00:11:39.410 --> 00:11:39.420 align:start position:0%
actually predict the future I can't we
 
00:11:39.420 --> 00:11:40.670 align:start position:0%
actually predict the future I can't we
can't

00:11:40.670 --> 00:11:40.680 align:start position:0%
can't
 
00:11:42.949 --> 00:11:42.959 align:start position:0%
what I can say is that from the day our
 
00:11:45.110 --> 00:11:45.120 align:start position:0%
numbers stop moving which was pretty
 
00:11:48.050 --> 00:11:48.060 align:start position:0%
much about January 31st of this year
 
00:11:49.610 --> 00:11:49.620 align:start position:0%
they were the most reasonable numbers
 
00:11:51.949 --> 00:11:51.959 align:start position:0%
that we could develop based on the
 
00:11:53.990 --> 00:11:54.000 align:start position:0%
information we had at the time and I
 
00:11:55.670 --> 00:11:55.680 align:start position:0%
want to emphasize the phrase information
 
00:11:59.090 --> 00:11:59.100 align:start position:0%
we had at the time Revenue projections
 
00:12:02.569 --> 00:12:02.579 align:start position:0%
like this should constantly be updated
 
00:12:04.910 --> 00:12:04.920 align:start position:0%
the first Revenue projections that I was
 
00:12:07.310 --> 00:12:07.320 align:start position:0%
involved with happened last July and
 
00:12:08.870 --> 00:12:08.880 align:start position:0%
they have changed dramatically and
 
00:12:11.150 --> 00:12:11.160 align:start position:0%
significantly from that date
 
00:12:12.949 --> 00:12:12.959 align:start position:0%
now to properly properly estimate
 
00:12:15.829 --> 00:12:15.839 align:start position:0%
revenues you you need two basic things
 
00:12:18.710 --> 00:12:18.720 align:start position:0%
one is a historical knowledge of how
 
00:12:22.009 --> 00:12:22.019 align:start position:0%
revenues react given certain changes now
 
00:12:24.410 --> 00:12:24.420 align:start position:0%
given certain predictable events the
 
00:12:28.009 --> 00:12:28.019 align:start position:0%
other is info information flow over time
 
00:12:31.130 --> 00:12:31.140 align:start position:0%
the uh the forecast we put together for
 
00:12:33.710 --> 00:12:33.720 align:start position:0%
this Budget on January 31st is
 
00:12:35.569 --> 00:12:35.579 align:start position:0%
significantly better than the one we put
 
00:12:37.790 --> 00:12:37.800 align:start position:0%
together in July and the reason of that
 
00:12:39.410 --> 00:12:39.420 align:start position:0%
is obviously we had six months of
 
00:12:41.750 --> 00:12:41.760 align:start position:0%
revenues already in the books instead of
 
00:12:43.430 --> 00:12:43.440 align:start position:0%
projecting 12 months of Revenue we only
 
00:12:45.590 --> 00:12:45.600 align:start position:0%
had to project six that's much easier of
 
00:12:48.170 --> 00:12:48.180 align:start position:0%
course extrapolating that point further
 
00:12:51.050 --> 00:12:51.060 align:start position:0%
out a forecast done in April will be
 
00:12:52.550 --> 00:12:52.560 align:start position:0%
more accurate than when I have before
 
00:12:53.810 --> 00:12:53.820 align:start position:0%
you today
 
00:12:55.610 --> 00:12:55.620 align:start position:0%
I think it's vital that over the next
 
00:12:57.949 --> 00:12:57.959 align:start position:0%
few months as you quickly wrap up your
 
00:12:59.629 --> 00:12:59.639 align:start position:0%
projections then the Senate gets there
 
00:13:02.509 --> 00:13:02.519 align:start position:0%
is that we all work together uh to
 
00:13:04.850 --> 00:13:04.860 align:start position:0%
update these revenues continuously so
 
00:13:06.050 --> 00:13:06.060 align:start position:0%
we're all working with the same
 
00:13:08.030 --> 00:13:08.040 align:start position:0%
information and better information as
 
00:13:09.710 --> 00:13:09.720 align:start position:0%
time goes on
 
00:13:13.910 --> 00:13:13.920 align:start position:0%
now this were 2015 or 2019 I might not
 
00:13:15.650 --> 00:13:15.660 align:start position:0%
be as concerned about the day-to-day
 
00:13:17.269 --> 00:13:17.279 align:start position:0%
information although it's always helpful
 
00:13:19.910 --> 00:13:19.920 align:start position:0%
however we are living in economic and
 
00:13:22.190 --> 00:13:22.200 align:start position:0%
financially volatile times
 
00:13:24.470 --> 00:13:24.480 align:start position:0%
looking back over the last eight budgets
 
00:13:26.509 --> 00:13:26.519 align:start position:0%
I can give you a little sense in how the
 
00:13:28.550 --> 00:13:28.560 align:start position:0%
state general fund and education trust
 
00:13:30.410 --> 00:13:30.420 align:start position:0%
fund compared to plan
 
00:13:33.710 --> 00:13:33.720 align:start position:0%
in 2016 we were seven our revenues were
 
00:13:37.490 --> 00:13:37.500 align:start position:0%
seven percent over planned in 2017 four
 
00:13:41.569 --> 00:13:41.579 align:start position:0%
percent in 2018 5.3 percent in 2019
 
00:13:44.210 --> 00:13:44.220 align:start position:0%
seven percent so mid single digit
 
00:13:47.810 --> 00:13:47.820 align:start position:0%
increases over plan then covet hit
 
00:13:51.829 --> 00:13:51.839 align:start position:0%
in 2020 our revenues were 5.5 percent
 
00:13:53.449 --> 00:13:53.459 align:start position:0%
under plan
 
00:13:57.910 --> 00:13:57.920 align:start position:0%
in 2021 11.6 over plan
 
00:14:02.030 --> 00:14:02.040 align:start position:0%
2022 15.4 percent over plan and through
 
00:14:04.730 --> 00:14:04.740 align:start position:0%
this first six months of 2023 fiscal
 
00:14:09.470 --> 00:14:09.480 align:start position:0%
year 21.2 percent over plan so things
 
00:14:11.750 --> 00:14:11.760 align:start position:0%
things have changed clearly the covet
 
00:14:13.730 --> 00:14:13.740 align:start position:0%
pandemic has caused typical Revenue
 
00:14:15.650 --> 00:14:15.660 align:start position:0%
forecasts that were made at the
 
00:14:18.410 --> 00:14:18.420 align:start position:0%
beginning of 2020 to become irrelevant
 
00:14:20.930 --> 00:14:20.940 align:start position:0%
they were not wrong at the time things
 
00:14:24.350 --> 00:14:24.360 align:start position:0%
changed and that's my caution to you is
 
00:14:26.030 --> 00:14:26.040 align:start position:0%
is to
 
00:14:28.190 --> 00:14:28.200 align:start position:0%
to the extent possible recognize these
 
00:14:30.290 --> 00:14:30.300 align:start position:0%
changing these changes and the changes
 
00:14:31.310 --> 00:14:31.320 align:start position:0%
are obviously not just things that
 
00:14:33.050 --> 00:14:33.060 align:start position:0%
happen in New Hampshire but but on a
 
00:14:35.389 --> 00:14:35.399 align:start position:0%
worldwide stage uh there there were two
 
00:14:36.710 --> 00:14:36.720 align:start position:0%
things I could think about the top of my
 
00:14:38.269 --> 00:14:38.279 align:start position:0%
head that could over the next few months
 
00:14:39.949 --> 00:14:39.959 align:start position:0%
that could have a dramatic impact on
 
00:14:43.370 --> 00:14:43.380 align:start position:0%
revenues uh the the first is the war in
 
00:14:45.949 --> 00:14:45.959 align:start position:0%
Ukraine and that war were to end today
 
00:14:48.230 --> 00:14:48.240 align:start position:0%
the conventional wisdom is that it would
 
00:14:49.430 --> 00:14:49.440 align:start position:0%
be a very po it would have a very
 
00:14:51.470 --> 00:14:51.480 align:start position:0%
positive impact on the U.S economy and
 
00:14:52.850 --> 00:14:52.860 align:start position:0%
therefore the New Hampshire economy
 
00:14:55.069 --> 00:14:55.079 align:start position:0%
Russian gas and oil would start flowing
 
00:14:57.170 --> 00:14:57.180 align:start position:0%
again Lower fuel prices mean lower
 
00:14:59.329 --> 00:14:59.339 align:start position:0%
inflation lower inflation should lead to
 
00:15:02.210 --> 00:15:02.220 align:start position:0%
lower interest rates uh and that's
 
00:15:04.730 --> 00:15:04.740 align:start position:0%
obviously more money uh in the pockets
 
00:15:07.610 --> 00:15:07.620 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire residents conversely
 
00:15:10.069 --> 00:15:10.079 align:start position:0%
there is a question of increase in the
 
00:15:11.329 --> 00:15:11.339 align:start position:0%
debt limit in Washington which will
 
00:15:13.490 --> 00:15:13.500 align:start position:0%
happen in July the conventional wisdom
 
00:15:15.170 --> 00:15:15.180 align:start position:0%
there is it that the debt limit is not
 
00:15:17.329 --> 00:15:17.339 align:start position:0%
increased it would have a dramatic and
 
00:15:20.569 --> 00:15:20.579 align:start position:0%
negative impact on the economy uh I
 
00:15:23.810 --> 00:15:23.820 align:start position:0%
think looking at both uh are either
 
00:15:25.970 --> 00:15:25.980 align:start position:0%
likely to happen no but they are things
 
00:15:28.910 --> 00:15:28.920 align:start position:0%
that we need to keep a uh your our eye
 
00:15:28.920 --> 00:15:30.170 align:start position:0%
that we need to keep a uh your our eye
on

00:15:30.170 --> 00:15:30.180 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:15:31.970 --> 00:15:31.980 align:start position:0%
it's okay so after this long-winded
 
00:15:34.310 --> 00:15:34.320 align:start position:0%
response as to all the ways we could and
 
00:15:36.170 --> 00:15:36.180 align:start position:0%
probably are wrong I will tell you why
 
00:15:38.269 --> 00:15:38.279 align:start position:0%
we're right
 
00:15:39.590 --> 00:15:39.600 align:start position:0%
I guess that you turn to the
 
00:15:41.329 --> 00:15:41.339 align:start position:0%
presentation that was handed out at the
 
00:15:44.569 --> 00:15:44.579 align:start position:0%
beginning uh I promise to go through
 
00:15:45.829 --> 00:15:45.839 align:start position:0%
these Pages quickly because I know
 
00:15:48.769 --> 00:15:48.779 align:start position:0%
you've heard these numbers before
 
00:15:50.629 --> 00:15:50.639 align:start position:0%
on the second page of the presentation
 
00:15:52.730 --> 00:15:52.740 align:start position:0%
you'll see the full projection of
 
00:15:54.290 --> 00:15:54.300 align:start position:0%
general and education trust fund
 
00:15:56.569 --> 00:15:56.579 align:start position:0%
revenues well I will discuss the
 
00:15:58.430 --> 00:15:58.440 align:start position:0%
individual taxes that make up these fund
 
00:16:01.430 --> 00:16:01.440 align:start position:0%
I want to make a few observations here
 
00:16:04.850 --> 00:16:04.860 align:start position:0%
first we are projecting 2023 will end
 
00:16:07.189 --> 00:16:07.199 align:start position:0%
with General and education fund revenues
 
00:16:08.710 --> 00:16:08.720 align:start position:0%
equal to
 
00:16:12.170 --> 00:16:12.180 align:start position:0%
3.1578 billion dollars this represents a
 
00:16:16.310 --> 00:16:16.320 align:start position:0%
2.4 percent decline for fiscal year 22.
 
00:16:19.009 --> 00:16:19.019 align:start position:0%
in fiscal year 24 we are projecting a
 
00:16:21.889 --> 00:16:21.899 align:start position:0%
0.13 increase in revenues from these
 
00:16:23.629 --> 00:16:23.639 align:start position:0%
funds and this includes no Revenue
 
00:16:25.970 --> 00:16:25.980 align:start position:0%
coming from the communications tax which
 
00:16:27.889 --> 00:16:27.899 align:start position:0%
I'll explain a little later on the
 
00:16:27.899 --> 00:16:29.449 align:start position:0%
I'll explain a little later on the
presentation

00:16:29.449 --> 00:16:29.459 align:start position:0%
presentation
 
00:16:32.509 --> 00:16:32.519 align:start position:0%
I mean in 2025 we see another 0.76
 
00:16:34.449 --> 00:16:34.459 align:start position:0%
percent decline in projected revenues
 
00:16:37.069 --> 00:16:37.079 align:start position:0%
however the numbers in the budget and
 
00:16:38.629 --> 00:16:38.639 align:start position:0%
the percentage changes that I just gave
 
00:16:41.870 --> 00:16:41.880 align:start position:0%
you are a bit misleading because of the
 
00:16:44.090 --> 00:16:44.100 align:start position:0%
one-year 100 million dollar reduction in
 
00:16:46.810 --> 00:16:46.820 align:start position:0%
the amount of sweat taxes collected in
 
00:16:50.449 --> 00:16:50.459 align:start position:0%
2023 100 million dollars less swept tax
 
00:16:52.490 --> 00:16:52.500 align:start position:0%
was collected than is going to be
 
00:16:57.769 --> 00:16:57.779 align:start position:0%
collected in 2024 or 2022. it will
 
00:17:00.829 --> 00:17:00.839 align:start position:0%
increase uh back to its original a
 
00:17:03.949 --> 00:17:03.959 align:start position:0%
traditional 363 million dollar level
 
00:17:06.590 --> 00:17:06.600 align:start position:0%
when you look at the total year-to-year
 
00:17:09.350 --> 00:17:09.360 align:start position:0%
change while excluding swept revenues
 
00:17:12.590 --> 00:17:12.600 align:start position:0%
are estimated to decline 3.31 percent in
 
00:17:18.530 --> 00:17:18.540 align:start position:0%
24 and an additional 0.86 and 25. so uh
 
00:17:21.890 --> 00:17:21.900 align:start position:0%
the overall change from 2022 to 2025
 
00:17:23.510 --> 00:17:23.520 align:start position:0%
will see a decline in revenues of about
 
00:17:24.890 --> 00:17:24.900 align:start position:0%
three percent
 
00:17:26.390 --> 00:17:26.400 align:start position:0%
if you were to add back in the
 
00:17:28.490 --> 00:17:28.500 align:start position:0%
communications tax revenue the clock
 
00:17:30.650 --> 00:17:30.660 align:start position:0%
decline is still real it's but it's a
 
00:17:33.409 --> 00:17:33.419 align:start position:0%
slightly less at 2.1 percent
 
00:17:36.350 --> 00:17:36.360 align:start position:0%
one thing I hear and I'm asked about uh
 
00:17:38.390 --> 00:17:38.400 align:start position:0%
constantly is given the strong economy
 
00:17:41.150 --> 00:17:41.160 align:start position:0%
that we've had and record-setting
 
00:17:43.549 --> 00:17:43.559 align:start position:0%
revenues should the decrease actually be
 
00:17:43.559 --> 00:17:44.930 align:start position:0%
revenues should the decrease actually be
larger

00:17:44.930 --> 00:17:44.940 align:start position:0%
larger
 
00:17:48.710 --> 00:17:48.720 align:start position:0%
perhaps however I ask you to look at the
 
00:17:51.890 --> 00:17:51.900 align:start position:0%
economic data and the economic data has
 
00:17:53.510 --> 00:17:53.520 align:start position:0%
been erratic
 
00:17:55.730 --> 00:17:55.740 align:start position:0%
but over the last four quarters the
 
00:17:58.070 --> 00:17:58.080 align:start position:0%
growth in the U.S economy as measured by
 
00:18:01.810 --> 00:18:01.820 align:start position:0%
GDP has been as follows negative 0.16
 
00:18:06.950 --> 00:18:06.960 align:start position:0%
negative 0.6 3.2 and 2.9 percent that's
 
00:18:08.930 --> 00:18:08.940 align:start position:0%
an average growth rate of less than one
 
00:18:11.029 --> 00:18:11.039 align:start position:0%
percent yet produce record-setting
 
00:18:13.730 --> 00:18:13.740 align:start position:0%
revenues that is hardly an economy on
 
00:18:13.740 --> 00:18:14.570 align:start position:0%
revenues that is hardly an economy on
fire

00:18:14.570 --> 00:18:14.580 align:start position:0%
fire
 
00:18:16.250 --> 00:18:16.260 align:start position:0%
so while the future as I mentioned my
 
00:18:18.590 --> 00:18:18.600 align:start position:0%
opening is volatile and unpredictable
 
00:18:21.289 --> 00:18:21.299 align:start position:0%
there is still room for growth however
 
00:18:23.029 --> 00:18:23.039 align:start position:0%
we believe that while that possibility
 
00:18:25.610 --> 00:18:25.620 align:start position:0%
exists we are taking a more cautious
 
00:18:27.950 --> 00:18:27.960 align:start position:0%
approach by predicting a slight decline
 
00:18:29.810 --> 00:18:29.820 align:start position:0%
over the biennium
 
00:18:32.570 --> 00:18:32.580 align:start position:0%
now if you turn to page three you will
 
00:18:34.070 --> 00:18:34.080 align:start position:0%
see how the revenue projections
 
00:18:35.510 --> 00:18:35.520 align:start position:0%
presented in the governor's budget
 
00:18:37.730 --> 00:18:37.740 align:start position:0%
differs from the revenue projections the
 
00:18:39.830 --> 00:18:39.840 align:start position:0%
various departments have given you
 
00:18:41.570 --> 00:18:41.580 align:start position:0%
on this and the pages that fall I'm
 
00:18:42.529 --> 00:18:42.539 align:start position:0%
going to talk about the revenue
 
00:18:44.750 --> 00:18:44.760 align:start position:0%
projection streams where our forecast is
 
00:18:46.669 --> 00:18:46.679 align:start position:0%
either High higher or significantly
 
00:18:48.950 --> 00:18:48.960 align:start position:0%
different than those of the Departments
 
00:18:51.110 --> 00:18:51.120 align:start position:0%
most of the differences come about as a
 
00:18:54.110 --> 00:18:54.120 align:start position:0%
result of timing our numbers stop moving
 
00:18:56.990 --> 00:18:57.000 align:start position:0%
the day before theirs did or or before
 
00:18:59.510 --> 00:18:59.520 align:start position:0%
theirs did so almost always the
 
00:19:00.970 --> 00:19:00.980 align:start position:0%
Departments will have better information
 
00:19:04.370 --> 00:19:04.380 align:start position:0%
than the numbers that I gave you
 
00:19:07.250 --> 00:19:07.260 align:start position:0%
looking on page three you'll see the
 
00:19:09.049 --> 00:19:09.059 align:start position:0%
first one that's there and is
 
00:19:10.909 --> 00:19:10.919 align:start position:0%
highlighted in red if it's in if it's in
 
00:19:14.510 --> 00:19:14.520 align:start position:0%
green that means that we are at or below
 
00:19:16.610 --> 00:19:16.620 align:start position:0%
the range given by the Departments red
 
00:19:18.950 --> 00:19:18.960 align:start position:0%
means we're higher so looking at page
 
00:19:21.010 --> 00:19:21.020 align:start position:0%
three you see that the Liquor Commission
 
00:19:23.350 --> 00:19:23.360 align:start position:0%
is highlighted in red
 
00:19:27.350 --> 00:19:27.360 align:start position:0%
the reason for the difference uh is is
 
00:19:29.210 --> 00:19:29.220 align:start position:0%
is not really a timing issue is just
 
00:19:31.210 --> 00:19:31.220 align:start position:0%
with the assumptions that that they used
 
00:19:35.090 --> 00:19:35.100 align:start position:0%
uh their number includes a transfer to
 
00:19:35.100 --> 00:19:36.529 align:start position:0%
uh their number includes a transfer to
HHS

00:19:36.529 --> 00:19:36.539 align:start position:0%
HHS
 
00:19:38.570 --> 00:19:38.580 align:start position:0%
so if you back out that transfer our
 
00:19:40.310 --> 00:19:40.320 align:start position:0%
numbers are the same
 
00:19:43.669 --> 00:19:43.679 align:start position:0%
so we will uh we will firm that up with
 
00:19:46.250 --> 00:19:46.260 align:start position:0%
uh with staff and make sure we get the
 
00:19:47.990 --> 00:19:48.000 align:start position:0%
right number but we we have confidence
 
00:19:49.490 --> 00:19:49.500 align:start position:0%
that our number you know without
 
00:19:51.110 --> 00:19:51.120 align:start position:0%
including that transfer is the correct
 
00:19:51.120 --> 00:19:52.070 align:start position:0%
including that transfer is the correct
number

00:19:52.070 --> 00:19:52.080 align:start position:0%
number
 
00:19:54.770 --> 00:19:54.780 align:start position:0%
uh the insurance tax this is a timing
 
00:19:57.590 --> 00:19:57.600 align:start position:0%
issue we were one million dollars or
 
00:19:59.930 --> 00:19:59.940 align:start position:0%
point seven one percent higher than
 
00:20:03.049 --> 00:20:03.059 align:start position:0%
Insurance uh again they have the best
 
00:20:05.450 --> 00:20:05.460 align:start position:0%
and latest information and I would
 
00:20:07.430 --> 00:20:07.440 align:start position:0%
adjust our numbers to match theirs their
 
00:20:10.010 --> 00:20:10.020 align:start position:0%
number is the controlling number
 
00:20:11.690 --> 00:20:11.700 align:start position:0%
and that brings us to the real estate
 
00:20:13.789 --> 00:20:13.799 align:start position:0%
transfer tax
 
00:20:16.789 --> 00:20:16.799 align:start position:0%
this is the one that I worry about the
 
00:20:16.799 --> 00:20:18.169 align:start position:0%
this is the one that I worry about the
most

00:20:18.169 --> 00:20:18.179 align:start position:0%
most
 
00:20:20.930 --> 00:20:20.940 align:start position:0%
at the end of December the real estate
 
00:20:23.210 --> 00:20:23.220 align:start position:0%
transfer track tax was projected to
 
00:20:26.029 --> 00:20:26.039 align:start position:0%
bring in about 250
 
00:20:26.039 --> 00:20:32.150 align:start position:0%
bring in about 250
sure

00:20:32.150 --> 00:20:32.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:36.590 --> 00:20:36.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:39.169 --> 00:20:39.179 align:start position:0%
mine's okay
 
00:20:39.179 --> 00:20:42.950 align:start position:0%
mine's okay
yep

00:20:42.950 --> 00:20:42.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:51.909 --> 00:20:51.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:11.570 --> 00:21:11.580 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:16.430 --> 00:21:16.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:22.510 --> 00:21:22.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:25.669 --> 00:21:25.679 align:start position:0%
hello yeah all right I think we're back
 
00:21:27.950 --> 00:21:27.960 align:start position:0%
up how about on your side representative
 
00:21:32.330 --> 00:21:32.340 align:start position:0%
fellows we have okay good all right so
 
00:21:34.190 --> 00:21:34.200 align:start position:0%
this is fascinating and everything
 
00:21:35.990 --> 00:21:36.000 align:start position:0%
you're saying I'm taking copious notes
 
00:21:37.850 --> 00:21:37.860 align:start position:0%
but in some cases we might need to slow
 
00:21:39.529 --> 00:21:39.539 align:start position:0%
you down if that's okay because we have
 
00:21:41.270 --> 00:21:41.280 align:start position:0%
questions along the way I saw a hand
 
00:21:48.289 --> 00:21:48.299 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:51.770 --> 00:21:51.780 align:start position:0%
on the uh you started on this page with
 
00:21:54.470 --> 00:21:54.480 align:start position:0%
the governor's estimates compared with
 
00:21:58.610 --> 00:21:58.620 align:start position:0%
the Department estimates I uh
 
00:21:58.620 --> 00:21:59.450 align:start position:0%
the Department estimates I uh
um

00:21:59.450 --> 00:21:59.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:22:02.390 --> 00:22:02.400 align:start position:0%
so I think we're on that page with the
 
00:22:05.570 --> 00:22:05.580 align:start position:0%
green and the red and um I wondered uh
 
00:22:09.169 --> 00:22:09.179 align:start position:0%
take the first one the business uh taxes
 
00:22:10.850 --> 00:22:10.860 align:start position:0%
you've got one two five seven for the
 
00:22:12.590 --> 00:22:12.600 align:start position:0%
Governor's estimates in the department
 
00:22:14.090 --> 00:22:14.100 align:start position:0%
the same number
 
00:22:16.549 --> 00:22:16.559 align:start position:0%
but in the Department's case that's the
 
00:22:19.430 --> 00:22:19.440 align:start position:0%
high that is the highest of their high
 
00:22:20.450 --> 00:22:20.460 align:start position:0%
and low
 
00:22:23.750 --> 00:22:23.760 align:start position:0%
so my question is why are you taking
 
00:22:27.350 --> 00:22:27.360 align:start position:0%
taking the high of uh of dra's estimates
 
00:22:29.990 --> 00:22:30.000 align:start position:0%
I think you do that consistently we we
 
00:22:33.529 --> 00:22:33.539 align:start position:0%
do do that consistently and uh the main
 
00:22:35.570 --> 00:22:35.580 align:start position:0%
reason is we're very optimistic about
 
00:22:38.390 --> 00:22:38.400 align:start position:0%
the the the the underlying economy in
 
00:22:41.149 --> 00:22:41.159 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire uh we have seen a number
 
00:22:44.450 --> 00:22:44.460 align:start position:0%
of businesses move into New Hampshire uh
 
00:22:47.210 --> 00:22:47.220 align:start position:0%
demand for basic uh goods and services
 
00:22:49.850 --> 00:22:49.860 align:start position:0%
remains very strong uh the housing
 
00:22:51.830 --> 00:22:51.840 align:start position:0%
market which I'm about to get into while
 
00:22:54.529 --> 00:22:54.539 align:start position:0%
off from last year is still strong even
 
00:22:56.810 --> 00:22:56.820 align:start position:0%
though it's a plus or minus it has
 
00:22:59.870 --> 00:22:59.880 align:start position:0%
pluses and minuses uh there is a strong
 
00:23:02.210 --> 00:23:02.220 align:start position:0%
demand for housing in New Hampshire and
 
00:23:06.710 --> 00:23:06.720 align:start position:0%
that continues and we believe that the
 
00:23:10.149 --> 00:23:10.159 align:start position:0%
uh the the business climate of of
 
00:23:12.830 --> 00:23:12.840 align:start position:0%
businesses uh especially Massachusetts
 
00:23:15.350 --> 00:23:15.360 align:start position:0%
businesses moving to New Hampshire is
 
00:23:16.909 --> 00:23:16.919 align:start position:0%
going to continue
 
00:23:19.610 --> 00:23:19.620 align:start position:0%
so so that's why we are on the
 
00:23:22.610 --> 00:23:22.620 align:start position:0%
optimistic side of of their range Madam
 
00:23:25.190 --> 00:23:25.200 align:start position:0%
chair representative Southworth uh thank
 
00:23:27.710 --> 00:23:27.720 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question is it similar
 
00:23:29.630 --> 00:23:29.640 align:start position:0%
for number two that you're optimistic
 
00:23:32.390 --> 00:23:32.400 align:start position:0%
about that industry uh meals and rentals
 
00:23:35.029 --> 00:23:35.039 align:start position:0%
yes absolutely with meals and rentals
 
00:23:38.450 --> 00:23:38.460 align:start position:0%
one of the things we saw which after the
 
00:23:40.549 --> 00:23:40.559 align:start position:0%
pandemic and the restaurants opened up
 
00:23:42.830 --> 00:23:42.840 align:start position:0%
we saw meals and Rental Stacks Skyrocket
 
00:23:42.840 --> 00:23:44.870 align:start position:0%
we saw meals and Rental Stacks Skyrocket
and

00:23:44.870 --> 00:23:44.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:23:48.409 --> 00:23:48.419 align:start position:0%
um with that uh you know the feeling was
 
00:23:50.750 --> 00:23:50.760 align:start position:0%
maybe it was just pent-up demand that
 
00:23:52.130 --> 00:23:52.140 align:start position:0%
people just wanted to get out of the
 
00:23:56.149 --> 00:23:56.159 align:start position:0%
house and started to go and uh as we've
 
00:23:58.669 --> 00:23:58.679 align:start position:0%
seen over the over the over the last uh
 
00:24:00.110 --> 00:24:00.120 align:start position:0%
over the last year and especially over
 
00:24:02.330 --> 00:24:02.340 align:start position:0%
the last few months is that the mules
 
00:24:05.390 --> 00:24:05.400 align:start position:0%
and Rental sex continues to be very
 
00:24:07.370 --> 00:24:07.380 align:start position:0%
strong and one of the things to keep in
 
00:24:09.350 --> 00:24:09.360 align:start position:0%
mind is there a lot of restaurants are
 
00:24:12.110 --> 00:24:12.120 align:start position:0%
doing this despite decreased hours the
 
00:24:14.630 --> 00:24:14.640 align:start position:0%
work shortages is real a lot of
 
00:24:16.190 --> 00:24:16.200 align:start position:0%
restaurants have had to cut back on
 
00:24:18.649 --> 00:24:18.659 align:start position:0%
hours and they're still producing record
 
00:24:21.649 --> 00:24:21.659 align:start position:0%
revenues and we believe that when the
 
00:24:25.970 --> 00:24:25.980 align:start position:0%
workforce uh comes back in line that uh
 
00:24:27.590 --> 00:24:27.600 align:start position:0%
we're going to see even higher revenues
 
00:24:30.470 --> 00:24:30.480 align:start position:0%
from them I'm with clarification
 
00:24:32.690 --> 00:24:32.700 align:start position:0%
um have you found um that it is still
 
00:24:34.789 --> 00:24:34.799 align:start position:0%
uneven around the whole state like I'm
 
00:24:36.649 --> 00:24:36.659 align:start position:0%
in the Seacoast and I agree it's booming
 
00:24:39.470 --> 00:24:39.480 align:start position:0%
but I'm not sure it is everywhere
 
00:24:42.590 --> 00:24:42.600 align:start position:0%
uh that's possible if if uh we have
 
00:24:44.090 --> 00:24:44.100 align:start position:0%
someone in the room who maybe have a
 
00:24:46.250 --> 00:24:46.260 align:start position:0%
better answer that but uh I mean we've
 
00:24:47.810 --> 00:24:47.820 align:start position:0%
seen strong growth throughout the state
 
00:24:49.850 --> 00:24:49.860 align:start position:0%
but certain Pockets have
 
00:24:53.390 --> 00:24:53.400 align:start position:0%
uh Stronger uh projections than others
 
00:24:53.400 --> 00:24:54.169 align:start position:0%
uh Stronger uh projections than others
but

00:24:54.169 --> 00:24:54.179 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:24:56.750 --> 00:24:56.760 align:start position:0%
representative Army
 
00:24:57.950 --> 00:24:57.960 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:24:57.960 --> 00:24:59.630 align:start position:0%
thank you
on

00:24:59.630 --> 00:24:59.640 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:25:03.230 --> 00:25:03.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:08.330 --> 00:25:08.340 align:start position:0%
I think before the reduction from the
 
00:25:11.810 --> 00:25:11.820 align:start position:0%
what the ra estimated last time would be
 
00:25:15.529 --> 00:25:15.539 align:start position:0%
the cost of the tax changes that have
 
00:25:17.810 --> 00:25:17.820 align:start position:0%
been made in the past
 
00:25:19.909 --> 00:25:19.919 align:start position:0%
yeah we we have taken those into account
 
00:25:21.230 --> 00:25:21.240 align:start position:0%
as well
 
00:25:23.930 --> 00:25:23.940 align:start position:0%
did you take you take to account in in
 
00:25:26.090 --> 00:25:26.100 align:start position:0%
this and which is I think the same as
 
00:25:28.970 --> 00:25:28.980 align:start position:0%
your executive budget summary yes we did
 
00:25:32.570 --> 00:25:32.580 align:start position:0%
not not for business taxes well for yes
 
00:25:35.750 --> 00:25:35.760 align:start position:0%
for business taxes we did we we followed
 
00:25:41.470 --> 00:25:41.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:43.490 --> 00:25:43.500 align:start position:0%
you've uh
 
00:25:46.430 --> 00:25:46.440 align:start position:0%
we'll have crochet help us prepare
 
00:25:47.930 --> 00:25:47.940 align:start position:0%
things too
 
00:25:51.110 --> 00:25:51.120 align:start position:0%
representative Platt yes
 
00:25:53.450 --> 00:25:53.460 align:start position:0%
in any of these projections did you
 
00:25:53.460 --> 00:25:54.950 align:start position:0%
in any of these projections did you
assume

00:25:54.950 --> 00:25:54.960 align:start position:0%
assume
 
00:25:57.769 --> 00:25:57.779 align:start position:0%
a possibility of a recession how
 
00:26:00.110 --> 00:26:00.120 align:start position:0%
possible when and how did it affect your
 
00:26:03.710 --> 00:26:03.720 align:start position:0%
numbers uh we did in our and and if you
 
00:26:06.890 --> 00:26:06.900 align:start position:0%
remember I uh mentioned that our first
 
00:26:10.370 --> 00:26:10.380 align:start position:0%
estimate we did was in July and it
 
00:26:12.409 --> 00:26:12.419 align:start position:0%
varies dramatically from what we did now
 
00:26:15.350 --> 00:26:15.360 align:start position:0%
and that we were thinking it was a
 
00:26:18.169 --> 00:26:18.179 align:start position:0%
recession and if you look at the the
 
00:26:20.570 --> 00:26:20.580 align:start position:0%
economic data and economic opinion it's
 
00:26:22.789 --> 00:26:22.799 align:start position:0%
really flip-flopped almost 180 degrees
 
00:26:26.390 --> 00:26:26.400 align:start position:0%
because what you have is in in July
 
00:26:28.610 --> 00:26:28.620 align:start position:0%
about three quarters of economists were
 
00:26:30.289 --> 00:26:30.299 align:start position:0%
predicting a recession
 
00:26:32.289 --> 00:26:32.299 align:start position:0%
and now about three quarters of
 
00:26:34.549 --> 00:26:34.559 align:start position:0%
economists are not predicting a
 
00:26:36.890 --> 00:26:36.900 align:start position:0%
recession they believe that we're going
 
00:26:39.049 --> 00:26:39.059 align:start position:0%
to have that soft Landing which is the
 
00:26:42.169 --> 00:26:42.179 align:start position:0%
the goal of uh certainly was the goal of
 
00:26:44.269 --> 00:26:44.279 align:start position:0%
the Treasury Department and and the FED
 
00:26:46.010 --> 00:26:46.020 align:start position:0%
when they started raising interest rates
 
00:26:48.950 --> 00:26:48.960 align:start position:0%
and I think as we've seen uh in
 
00:26:52.190 --> 00:26:52.200 align:start position:0%
inflation start to come down the need to
 
00:26:55.070 --> 00:26:55.080 align:start position:0%
increase interest rates additionally is
 
00:26:58.430 --> 00:26:58.440 align:start position:0%
going to wane and so we do not believe
 
00:27:00.230 --> 00:27:00.240 align:start position:0%
currently that while we may have an
 
00:27:03.769 --> 00:27:03.779 align:start position:0%
economic slowdown nationally that that
 
00:27:06.529 --> 00:27:06.539 align:start position:0%
will be caused by a degree of factors We
 
00:27:09.110 --> 00:27:09.120 align:start position:0%
Believe again that the New Hampshire uh
 
00:27:12.649 --> 00:27:12.659 align:start position:0%
economy is one where it'll it could be
 
00:27:16.190 --> 00:27:16.200 align:start position:0%
immune to uh like a national slowdown
 
00:27:18.169 --> 00:27:18.179 align:start position:0%
and one of the main reasons is housing
 
00:27:20.149 --> 00:27:20.159 align:start position:0%
and what we've seen from other states
 
00:27:22.070 --> 00:27:22.080 align:start position:0%
especially in the South and the West as
 
00:27:24.890 --> 00:27:24.900 align:start position:0%
far as housing goes is that you have a
 
00:27:27.409 --> 00:27:27.419 align:start position:0%
lot of housing there that was built
 
00:27:30.710 --> 00:27:30.720 align:start position:0%
speculatively uh which is the when we
 
00:27:33.049 --> 00:27:33.059 align:start position:0%
got into the problem in 2007 and 2008
 
00:27:35.149 --> 00:27:35.159 align:start position:0%
that was the main driver of that but in
 
00:27:36.950 --> 00:27:36.960 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire we have such a pent-up
 
00:27:39.890 --> 00:27:39.900 align:start position:0%
demand for housing our vacancy rate is
 
00:27:42.710 --> 00:27:42.720 align:start position:0%
still next to zero and and while the
 
00:27:45.649 --> 00:27:45.659 align:start position:0%
housing on the uh wait list has
 
00:27:45.659 --> 00:27:46.930 align:start position:0%
housing on the uh wait list has
certainly

00:27:46.930 --> 00:27:46.940 align:start position:0%
certainly
 
00:27:50.750 --> 00:27:50.760 align:start position:0%
improved from a buyer's standpoint it's
 
00:27:52.669 --> 00:27:52.679 align:start position:0%
still very strong
 
00:27:55.010 --> 00:27:55.020 align:start position:0%
so we did but we are not predicting a
 
00:27:57.289 --> 00:27:57.299 align:start position:0%
projecting a recession and with these
 
00:27:57.299 --> 00:27:58.909 align:start position:0%
projecting a recession and with these
numbers

00:27:58.909 --> 00:27:58.919 align:start position:0%
numbers
 
00:28:01.010 --> 00:28:01.020 align:start position:0%
other questions at this time
 
00:28:02.630 --> 00:28:02.640 align:start position:0%
representative fellows
 
00:28:04.010 --> 00:28:04.020 align:start position:0%
um can you just
 
00:28:06.830 --> 00:28:06.840 align:start position:0%
um tell me about the meals and rooms tax
 
00:28:09.049 --> 00:28:09.059 align:start position:0%
because I remember that we dropped it to
 
00:28:11.510 --> 00:28:11.520 align:start position:0%
eight and a half percent was that is
 
00:28:14.210 --> 00:28:14.220 align:start position:0%
that permanent or does it bounce back up
 
00:28:16.070 --> 00:28:16.080 align:start position:0%
to nine no that's a permanent reduction
 
00:28:18.710 --> 00:28:18.720 align:start position:0%
okay thanks
 
00:28:21.470 --> 00:28:21.480 align:start position:0%
okay well you continue thank you okay
 
00:28:23.870 --> 00:28:23.880 align:start position:0%
um yeah we were on the subject of what
 
00:28:25.490 --> 00:28:25.500 align:start position:0%
keeps me up at night and that's the real
 
00:28:28.010 --> 00:28:28.020 align:start position:0%
estate transfer tax
 
00:28:29.690 --> 00:28:29.700 align:start position:0%
um at the end of December real estate
 
00:28:31.789 --> 00:28:31.799 align:start position:0%
transfer tracks uh if you extrapolate it
 
00:28:33.169 --> 00:28:33.179 align:start position:0%
to the end of the year was projected to
 
00:28:35.330 --> 00:28:35.340 align:start position:0%
bring in about 250 million dollars of
 
00:28:35.340 --> 00:28:36.230 align:start position:0%
bring in about 250 million dollars of
Revenue

00:28:36.230 --> 00:28:36.240 align:start position:0%
Revenue
 
00:28:39.110 --> 00:28:39.120 align:start position:0%
uh I pr our projection I believe at that
 
00:28:42.230 --> 00:28:42.240 align:start position:0%
time the dras projection or at least it
 
00:28:43.730 --> 00:28:43.740 align:start position:0%
really was an estimate at that point was
 
00:28:46.370 --> 00:28:46.380 align:start position:0%
roughly around 243 million
 
00:28:48.710 --> 00:28:48.720 align:start position:0%
however after our numbers stopped moving
 
00:28:52.130 --> 00:28:52.140 align:start position:0%
uh we got the January revenue report and
 
00:28:53.870 --> 00:28:53.880 align:start position:0%
saw that while the real estate transfer
 
00:28:56.510 --> 00:28:56.520 align:start position:0%
tax had a strong month historically
 
00:28:59.750 --> 00:28:59.760 align:start position:0%
and was above plan uh the January figure
 
00:29:03.289 --> 00:29:03.299 align:start position:0%
was a shocking 37.2 percent below the
 
00:29:06.409 --> 00:29:06.419 align:start position:0%
same month in 22. uh that certainly got
 
00:29:07.610 --> 00:29:07.620 align:start position:0%
our attention
 
00:29:09.950 --> 00:29:09.960 align:start position:0%
and my understanding is the February
 
00:29:13.510 --> 00:29:13.520 align:start position:0%
numbers are again above plan but below
 
00:29:16.789 --> 00:29:16.799 align:start position:0%
2022 numbers although at a much smaller
 
00:29:19.610 --> 00:29:19.620 align:start position:0%
at a much smaller rate uh as as
 
00:29:21.409 --> 00:29:21.419 align:start position:0%
commissioner stat pointed out in her
 
00:29:23.149 --> 00:29:23.159 align:start position:0%
testimony the January in February
 
00:29:26.870 --> 00:29:26.880 align:start position:0%
traditionally weak housing months uh so
 
00:29:29.810 --> 00:29:29.820 align:start position:0%
when you compare it to the force that
 
00:29:32.990 --> 00:29:33.000 align:start position:0%
was the beginning of 2022 that they're
 
00:29:34.730 --> 00:29:34.740 align:start position:0%
not as strong but these are some of they
 
00:29:37.610 --> 00:29:37.620 align:start position:0%
will be some of the uh strongest January
 
00:29:40.070 --> 00:29:40.080 align:start position:0%
and February numbers we have on record
 
00:29:43.190 --> 00:29:43.200 align:start position:0%
in addition the uncertainty over Rising
 
00:29:45.230 --> 00:29:45.240 align:start position:0%
interest rates and almost almost
 
00:29:47.870 --> 00:29:47.880 align:start position:0%
certainly played a role as we all as we
 
00:29:50.690 --> 00:29:50.700 align:start position:0%
know all too well despite housing uh in
 
00:29:52.430 --> 00:29:52.440 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire remaining in demand in the
 
00:29:54.830 --> 00:29:54.840 align:start position:0%
Outlook while still bright our forecast
 
00:29:57.769 --> 00:29:57.779 align:start position:0%
has dimmed uh in the week since our
 
00:30:00.110 --> 00:30:00.120 align:start position:0%
numbers were released and based on the
 
00:30:03.409 --> 00:30:03.419 align:start position:0%
latest information we have we now concur
 
00:30:05.510 --> 00:30:05.520 align:start position:0%
with the dras and commissioner steps
 
00:30:09.230 --> 00:30:09.240 align:start position:0%
forecasts of 227 million again this is
 
00:30:11.149 --> 00:30:11.159 align:start position:0%
something a number to keep your eye on
 
00:30:13.490 --> 00:30:13.500 align:start position:0%
because if there's if there's one
 
00:30:15.169 --> 00:30:15.179 align:start position:0%
Revenue Source that's going to be the
 
00:30:17.810 --> 00:30:17.820 align:start position:0%
most volatile in this in my opinion it's
 
00:30:19.250 --> 00:30:19.260 align:start position:0%
going to be the real estate transfer
 
00:30:19.260 --> 00:30:20.810 align:start position:0%
going to be the real estate transfer
attacks

00:30:20.810 --> 00:30:20.820 align:start position:0%
attacks
 
00:30:24.529 --> 00:30:24.539 align:start position:0%
uh the other category you see there uh
 
00:30:27.169 --> 00:30:27.179 align:start position:0%
we had projected a 97 million and as of
 
00:30:30.409 --> 00:30:30.419 align:start position:0%
last week the projection was 111 million
 
00:30:33.169 --> 00:30:33.179 align:start position:0%
I believe that was uh due to some
 
00:30:36.710 --> 00:30:36.720 align:start position:0%
miscommunication uh the 111 million was
 
00:30:39.710 --> 00:30:39.720 align:start position:0%
due to some miscommunication and that
 
00:30:41.570 --> 00:30:41.580 align:start position:0%
number has now been revised there was
 
00:30:43.490 --> 00:30:43.500 align:start position:0%
some double counting going on and that
 
00:30:45.710 --> 00:30:45.720 align:start position:0%
number has now been revised to 97
 
00:30:45.720 --> 00:30:47.110 align:start position:0%
number has now been revised to 97
million

00:30:47.110 --> 00:30:47.120 align:start position:0%
million
 
00:30:50.510 --> 00:30:50.520 align:start position:0%
uh so
 
00:30:52.190 --> 00:30:52.200 align:start position:0%
I think he's referring to the other
 
00:30:54.230 --> 00:30:54.240 align:start position:0%
right under beer tax the other category
 
00:30:56.269 --> 00:30:56.279 align:start position:0%
yeah that's the one Chris emailed us
 
00:30:58.669 --> 00:30:58.679 align:start position:0%
about it's like a double County thing
 
00:30:58.679 --> 00:31:01.430 align:start position:0%
about it's like a double County thing
okay

00:31:01.430 --> 00:31:01.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:05.389 --> 00:31:05.399 align:start position:0%
okay and the final number uh that's in
 
00:31:07.750 --> 00:31:07.760 align:start position:0%
red there is the utility property tax
 
00:31:11.389 --> 00:31:11.399 align:start position:0%
utility property tax is a 6.6 tax on the
 
00:31:13.490 --> 00:31:13.500 align:start position:0%
full market value of the utility being
 
00:31:17.029 --> 00:31:17.039 align:start position:0%
assessed increased profitability means
 
00:31:20.630 --> 00:31:20.640 align:start position:0%
increased assessed values uh
 
00:31:25.430 --> 00:31:25.440 align:start position:0%
therefore I was hopeful uh that upt
 
00:31:29.029 --> 00:31:29.039 align:start position:0%
would increase more uh however I had to
 
00:31:31.970 --> 00:31:31.980 align:start position:0%
remind myself and to keep in mind that
 
00:31:34.789 --> 00:31:34.799 align:start position:0%
the effective date of this of this
 
00:31:37.010 --> 00:31:37.020 align:start position:0%
assessed valuations and therefore the
 
00:31:38.750 --> 00:31:38.760 align:start position:0%
utility property tax while it's
 
00:31:41.990 --> 00:31:42.000 align:start position:0%
certified on December 15th the values go
 
00:31:44.990 --> 00:31:45.000 align:start position:0%
back to April 1st of 22. so the values
 
00:31:48.350 --> 00:31:48.360 align:start position:0%
that we produce the tax on go back prior
 
00:31:51.649 --> 00:31:51.659 align:start position:0%
to large rate increases that we've all
 
00:31:53.029 --> 00:31:53.039 align:start position:0%
been subject to from the utility
 
00:31:56.990 --> 00:31:57.000 align:start position:0%
companies uh therefore the the dra
 
00:31:59.810 --> 00:31:59.820 align:start position:0%
figure or the dra range for the utility
 
00:32:02.230 --> 00:32:02.240 align:start position:0%
property tax should be the operative one
 
00:32:05.269 --> 00:32:05.279 align:start position:0%
however uh going forward and I'll talk
 
00:32:07.789 --> 00:32:07.799 align:start position:0%
about this in a minute uh I'm I'm more
 
00:32:10.610 --> 00:32:10.620 align:start position:0%
and more confident in our numbers that
 
00:32:13.630 --> 00:32:13.640 align:start position:0%
the utility property tax will see
 
00:32:18.350 --> 00:32:18.360 align:start position:0%
increases in in 24 and 25.
 
00:32:21.230 --> 00:32:21.240 align:start position:0%
and and finally recoveries is also one
 
00:32:22.970 --> 00:32:22.980 align:start position:0%
that's that's a little different and
 
00:32:24.850 --> 00:32:24.860 align:start position:0%
that that's where actually we're under
 
00:32:27.950 --> 00:32:27.960 align:start position:0%
and the Medicaid recoveries we had is
 
00:32:30.169 --> 00:32:30.179 align:start position:0%
1.8 million in Health and Human Services
 
00:32:33.110 --> 00:32:33.120 align:start position:0%
has a 2.6 million uh 1.8 million is
 
00:32:35.690 --> 00:32:35.700 align:start position:0%
wrong uh I would go with the the
 
00:32:40.130 --> 00:32:40.140 align:start position:0%
estimate of 2.6 million given by HHS
 
00:32:43.250 --> 00:32:43.260 align:start position:0%
now uh when you look at the projected
 
00:32:45.470 --> 00:32:45.480 align:start position:0%
revenues as a whole for 23 you'll see
 
00:32:46.909 --> 00:32:46.919 align:start position:0%
that well we differ slightly on some
 
00:32:49.669 --> 00:32:49.679 align:start position:0%
taxes even with these changes our
 
00:32:54.830 --> 00:32:54.840 align:start position:0%
revenues are 3.157 billion or just 0.74
 
00:32:57.769 --> 00:32:57.779 align:start position:0%
lower than the agency estimates
 
00:33:01.630 --> 00:33:01.640 align:start position:0%
now turning to page four
 
00:33:04.610 --> 00:33:04.620 align:start position:0%
uh we'll you'll see the big n a there
 
00:33:06.470 --> 00:33:06.480 align:start position:0%
next sorry could we interrupt for one
 
00:33:22.850 --> 00:33:22.860 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:24.769 --> 00:33:24.779 align:start position:0%
ABS absolutely
 
00:33:27.889 --> 00:33:27.899 align:start position:0%
okay and I'll I'll highlight the ones
 
00:33:29.810 --> 00:33:29.820 align:start position:0%
the change ribs in a fellow just a
 
00:33:31.190 --> 00:33:31.200 align:start position:0%
reminder to turn your mic on so we can
 
00:33:32.750 --> 00:33:32.760 align:start position:0%
hear your question thank you so much
 
00:33:35.870 --> 00:33:35.880 align:start position:0%
okay The Liquor Commission Revenue I
 
00:33:39.529 --> 00:33:39.539 align:start position:0%
believe that uh our figure of 135
 
00:33:42.289 --> 00:33:42.299 align:start position:0%
million is the controlling figure
 
00:33:45.230 --> 00:33:45.240 align:start position:0%
for the insurance tax
 
00:33:48.289 --> 00:33:48.299 align:start position:0%
the Department's estimate of 139 million
 
00:33:51.529 --> 00:33:51.539 align:start position:0%
is the controlling figure
 
00:33:54.470 --> 00:33:54.480 align:start position:0%
that's that's the number we that I'm we
 
00:33:55.909 --> 00:33:55.919 align:start position:0%
are now going with yeah so they're now
 
00:33:58.970 --> 00:33:58.980 align:start position:0%
revising from what they started with so
 
00:34:00.409 --> 00:34:00.419 align:start position:0%
we'll take that into account in our
 
00:34:02.570 --> 00:34:02.580 align:start position:0%
discussions the real estate transfer tax
 
00:34:05.810 --> 00:34:05.820 align:start position:0%
of 227 million the dra estimate is the
 
00:34:08.810 --> 00:34:08.820 align:start position:0%
one I would go with
 
00:34:12.710 --> 00:34:12.720 align:start position:0%
uh in the other category the 97 million
 
00:34:14.629 --> 00:34:14.639 align:start position:0%
that we provided with is the one I
 
00:34:18.050 --> 00:34:18.060 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:21.230 --> 00:34:21.240 align:start position:0%
and the utility property tax the 46.3
 
00:34:23.930 --> 00:34:23.940 align:start position:0%
million that the dra provided is the one
 
00:34:25.970 --> 00:34:25.980 align:start position:0%
I think you should go with
 
00:34:28.550 --> 00:34:28.560 align:start position:0%
and finally recoveries
 
00:34:31.909 --> 00:34:31.919 align:start position:0%
the HHS test submit of 2.6 million is
 
00:34:37.129 --> 00:34:37.139 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:39.889 --> 00:34:39.899 align:start position:0%
representative janigan has a question
 
00:34:41.629 --> 00:34:41.639 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair just uh quickly
 
00:34:44.030 --> 00:34:44.040 align:start position:0%
the so the bottom number where you said
 
00:34:47.329 --> 00:34:47.339 align:start position:0%
the total change is 0.74 so have you
 
00:34:48.950 --> 00:34:48.960 align:start position:0%
figured out what the uh that updated
 
00:34:51.470 --> 00:34:51.480 align:start position:0%
number is based on these changes uh I
 
00:34:54.230 --> 00:34:54.240 align:start position:0%
have not but I can get that to you
 
00:34:55.790 --> 00:34:55.800 align:start position:0%
I have my calculator here I can get it
 
00:34:57.970 --> 00:34:57.980 align:start position:0%
from real fast
 
00:35:02.030 --> 00:35:02.040 align:start position:0%
okay okay go ahead on page four you see
 
00:35:04.310 --> 00:35:04.320 align:start position:0%
the communications tax
 
00:35:08.390 --> 00:35:08.400 align:start position:0%
um the the dra for 2024 is projecting I
 
00:35:11.150 --> 00:35:11.160 align:start position:0%
believe 29.9 million at the high end of
 
00:35:12.170 --> 00:35:12.180 align:start position:0%
their range
 
00:35:15.170 --> 00:35:15.180 align:start position:0%
and uh if
 
00:35:17.530 --> 00:35:17.540 align:start position:0%
uh our our number before
 
00:35:20.810 --> 00:35:20.820 align:start position:0%
we uh before the governor decided to
 
00:35:23.150 --> 00:35:23.160 align:start position:0%
eliminate that tax was was 28 million
 
00:35:26.030 --> 00:35:26.040 align:start position:0%
for for that purpose if you go that
 
00:35:27.829 --> 00:35:27.839 align:start position:0%
route but I just want to talk a little
 
00:35:29.390 --> 00:35:29.400 align:start position:0%
bit about the seven percent uh
 
00:35:31.550 --> 00:35:31.560 align:start position:0%
Communications tax it's a seven percent
 
00:35:34.130 --> 00:35:34.140 align:start position:0%
tax on two-way Communications it's
 
00:35:37.130 --> 00:35:37.140 align:start position:0%
traditional cell phones landlines uh
 
00:35:39.770 --> 00:35:39.780 align:start position:0%
cell phones phone calls things like that
 
00:35:39.780 --> 00:35:41.930 align:start position:0%
cell phones phone calls things like that
uh

00:35:41.930 --> 00:35:41.940 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:35:43.970 --> 00:35:43.980 align:start position:0%
Revenue collected from the
 
00:35:46.490 --> 00:35:46.500 align:start position:0%
communications tax was 72 million
 
00:35:49.130 --> 00:35:49.140 align:start position:0%
dollars in 2012.
 
00:35:51.349 --> 00:35:51.359 align:start position:0%
this year that'll be down to 29 million
 
00:35:55.849 --> 00:35:55.859 align:start position:0%
in 2023. it's really a dying tax
 
00:35:58.849 --> 00:35:58.859 align:start position:0%
and the reason why is because the nature
 
00:36:00.349 --> 00:36:00.359 align:start position:0%
of communication has changed
 
00:36:04.190 --> 00:36:04.200 align:start position:0%
dramatically it does not tax texting or
 
00:36:07.010 --> 00:36:07.020 align:start position:0%
calls made through apps such as if you
 
00:36:09.230 --> 00:36:09.240 align:start position:0%
if you FaceTime someone if you use
 
00:36:12.290 --> 00:36:12.300 align:start position:0%
WhatsApp or any number of the other apps
 
00:36:13.730 --> 00:36:13.740 align:start position:0%
you can use to make phone calls air
 
00:36:15.589 --> 00:36:15.599 align:start position:0%
knocks taxed but if you make a phone
 
00:36:17.270 --> 00:36:17.280 align:start position:0%
call you are
 
00:36:20.150 --> 00:36:20.160 align:start position:0%
and we found we find this to be a very
 
00:36:22.730 --> 00:36:22.740 align:start position:0%
regressive tax that impacts those who
 
00:36:25.910 --> 00:36:25.920 align:start position:0%
can't afford unlimited data plans I mean
 
00:36:30.410 --> 00:36:30.420 align:start position:0%
I I don't I I get maybe one or two phone
 
00:36:34.609 --> 00:36:34.619 align:start position:0%
calls a month from my two sons but I
 
00:36:36.349 --> 00:36:36.359 align:start position:0%
hear from them about 10 times a day
 
00:36:38.390 --> 00:36:38.400 align:start position:0%
because they're always texting uh you
 
00:36:40.609 --> 00:36:40.619 align:start position:0%
may have similar similar things going on
 
00:36:42.050 --> 00:36:42.060 align:start position:0%
or you're probably texting all the time
 
00:36:44.270 --> 00:36:44.280 align:start position:0%
too well before that you made phone
 
00:36:45.950 --> 00:36:45.960 align:start position:0%
calls and you got taxed which is why the
 
00:36:47.630 --> 00:36:47.640 align:start position:0%
revenue has fallen so dramatically and
 
00:36:51.530 --> 00:36:51.540 align:start position:0%
again the people who uh who can't afford
 
00:36:54.050 --> 00:36:54.060 align:start position:0%
unlimited data plans you know find it
 
00:36:55.490 --> 00:36:55.500 align:start position:0%
cheaper to actually make the phone calls
 
00:36:58.069 --> 00:36:58.079 align:start position:0%
and they're the ones being taxed so and
 
00:37:00.349 --> 00:37:00.359 align:start position:0%
we we saw while it's coming down from
 
00:37:03.349 --> 00:37:03.359 align:start position:0%
2012 really covid
 
00:37:05.390 --> 00:37:05.400 align:start position:0%
uh changed it because it really changed
 
00:37:08.390 --> 00:37:08.400 align:start position:0%
it for the business Community as well uh
 
00:37:10.550 --> 00:37:10.560 align:start position:0%
before you get on a conference call
 
00:37:13.370 --> 00:37:13.380 align:start position:0%
now you go on teams or or some other
 
00:37:15.589 --> 00:37:15.599 align:start position:0%
video service where you you can make
 
00:37:17.630 --> 00:37:17.640 align:start position:0%
phone calls or or a video conference
 
00:37:19.430 --> 00:37:19.440 align:start position:0%
call through those measures those are
 
00:37:21.230 --> 00:37:21.240 align:start position:0%
not taxed
 
00:37:24.170 --> 00:37:24.180 align:start position:0%
so that is uh the regressive effect that
 
00:37:27.410 --> 00:37:27.420 align:start position:0%
the revenues from it are dying uh have
 
00:37:29.150 --> 00:37:29.160 align:start position:0%
decreased dramatically and the fact it's
 
00:37:31.849 --> 00:37:31.859 align:start position:0%
a regressive tax is is why the governor
 
00:37:34.430 --> 00:37:34.440 align:start position:0%
is proposing that but again our figure
 
00:37:36.410 --> 00:37:36.420 align:start position:0%
which we believe will continue to go
 
00:37:39.230 --> 00:37:39.240 align:start position:0%
down is 28 million uh if you want a
 
00:37:40.250 --> 00:37:40.260 align:start position:0%
number from us to put it in
 
00:37:42.109 --> 00:37:42.119 align:start position:0%
representative Platt has a question a
 
00:37:43.970 --> 00:37:43.980 align:start position:0%
mechanical question
 
00:37:47.329 --> 00:37:47.339 align:start position:0%
assuming the governor proposal gets
 
00:37:49.910 --> 00:37:49.920 align:start position:0%
passed into law don't we still have to
 
00:37:52.490 --> 00:37:52.500 align:start position:0%
reflect the number here and then take it
 
00:37:55.609 --> 00:37:55.619 align:start position:0%
out in sb2 or something like that
 
00:37:59.089 --> 00:37:59.099 align:start position:0%
because it may not be passed into law
 
00:38:01.790 --> 00:38:01.800 align:start position:0%
um yeah which is why that's I think
 
00:38:06.470 --> 00:38:06.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:08.390 --> 00:38:08.400 align:start position:0%
so represent Platt
 
00:38:10.190 --> 00:38:10.200 align:start position:0%
you're going to provide your estimates
 
00:38:12.109 --> 00:38:12.119 align:start position:0%
which will then go down to finance
 
00:38:14.510 --> 00:38:14.520 align:start position:0%
committee and in house bill one there'll
 
00:38:15.950 --> 00:38:15.960 align:start position:0%
be an amendment to the unrestricted
 
00:38:17.390 --> 00:38:17.400 align:start position:0%
revenues in there that will adjust for
 
00:38:19.430 --> 00:38:19.440 align:start position:0%
whatever your Revenue estimates are
 
00:38:20.870 --> 00:38:20.880 align:start position:0%
that's what I thought thank you for
 
00:38:20.880 --> 00:38:24.530 align:start position:0%
that's what I thought thank you for
confirming

00:38:24.530 --> 00:38:24.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:28.730 --> 00:38:28.740 align:start position:0%
and so our estimate is uh for fiscal
 
00:38:33.170 --> 00:38:33.180 align:start position:0%
year 24 is is 28 million dollars which
 
00:38:35.810 --> 00:38:35.820 align:start position:0%
um looking here
 
00:38:35.820 --> 00:38:37.790 align:start position:0%
um looking here
is

00:38:37.790 --> 00:38:37.800 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:38:40.130 --> 00:38:40.140 align:start position:0%
actually almost at the low end of the
 
00:38:44.329 --> 00:38:44.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:47.630 --> 00:38:47.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:50.210 --> 00:38:50.220 align:start position:0%
why 25
 
00:38:50.220 --> 00:38:53.089 align:start position:0%
why 25
fy25

00:38:53.089 --> 00:38:53.099 align:start position:0%
fy25
 
00:38:55.310 --> 00:38:55.320 align:start position:0%
um it's we held it flat at 28 million as
 
00:38:55.320 --> 00:39:06.530 align:start position:0%
um it's we held it flat at 28 million as
well

00:39:06.530 --> 00:39:06.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:06.540 --> 00:39:13.690 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:39:13.690 --> 00:39:13.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:16.370 --> 00:39:16.380 align:start position:0%
representative almie has a question
 
00:39:18.770 --> 00:39:18.780 align:start position:0%
thank you on
 
00:39:24.230 --> 00:39:24.240 align:start position:0%
what is your thinking on the fact that
 
00:39:27.109 --> 00:39:27.119 align:start position:0%
in 24 is the first time we're going to
 
00:39:30.349 --> 00:39:30.359 align:start position:0%
see the single sales Factor controlling
 
00:39:35.270 --> 00:39:35.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:39.770 --> 00:39:39.780 align:start position:0%
um again what we did was I guess we have
 
00:39:41.450 --> 00:39:41.460 align:start position:0%
the impact it will have on it on
 
00:39:43.310 --> 00:39:43.320 align:start position:0%
revenues or
 
00:39:43.320 --> 00:39:45.230 align:start position:0%
revenues or
um

00:39:45.230 --> 00:39:45.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:39:48.770 --> 00:39:48.780 align:start position:0%
I I think I I'm going to defer to
 
00:39:51.230 --> 00:39:51.240 align:start position:0%
commissioner step on that if she has a a
 
00:39:55.190 --> 00:39:55.200 align:start position:0%
uh an idea I honestly say we did not
 
00:39:58.250 --> 00:39:58.260 align:start position:0%
factor that in significantly and as a as
 
00:40:01.069 --> 00:40:01.079 align:start position:0%
a moving as a major impact on on our
 
00:40:04.670 --> 00:40:04.680 align:start position:0%
numbers but I don't know if you
 
00:40:06.950 --> 00:40:06.960 align:start position:0%
have anything I'm sorry I'm absolutely
 
00:40:10.130 --> 00:40:10.140 align:start position:0%
putting her on the spot here so
 
00:40:12.950 --> 00:40:12.960 align:start position:0%
we could do this later good morning
 
00:40:14.390 --> 00:40:14.400 align:start position:0%
Lindsey staff commissioner New Hampshire
 
00:40:16.849 --> 00:40:16.859 align:start position:0%
Department of Revenue Administration
 
00:40:19.130 --> 00:40:19.140 align:start position:0%
um as I think we've talked about with
 
00:40:21.170 --> 00:40:21.180 align:start position:0%
this committee we were unable to assign
 
00:40:23.510 --> 00:40:23.520 align:start position:0%
a number to the impact of single sales
 
00:40:28.310 --> 00:40:28.320 align:start position:0%
Factor because we were moving the
 
00:40:28.320 --> 00:40:30.609 align:start position:0%
Factor because we were moving the
apportionment

00:40:30.609 --> 00:40:30.619 align:start position:0%
apportionment
 
00:40:33.650 --> 00:40:33.660 align:start position:0%
methodology for services and intangibles
 
00:40:36.710 --> 00:40:36.720 align:start position:0%
from cost of performance to market-based
 
00:40:38.930 --> 00:40:38.940 align:start position:0%
sourcing and then the impact of single
 
00:40:40.370 --> 00:40:40.380 align:start position:0%
sales Factor was coming right on the
 
00:40:42.170 --> 00:40:42.180 align:start position:0%
heels of that and so we didn't have the
 
00:40:45.530 --> 00:40:45.540 align:start position:0%
data in order to put a specific number
 
00:40:47.870 --> 00:40:47.880 align:start position:0%
on the impact of single sales factors so
 
00:40:50.690 --> 00:40:50.700 align:start position:0%
I think just generally From dra's
 
00:40:50.700 --> 00:40:52.010 align:start position:0%
I think just generally From dra's
perspective

00:40:52.010 --> 00:40:52.020 align:start position:0%
perspective
 
00:40:54.770 --> 00:40:54.780 align:start position:0%
there's no tax law change from our
 
00:40:56.630 --> 00:40:56.640 align:start position:0%
presentations associated with that move
 
00:40:59.690 --> 00:40:59.700 align:start position:0%
to single sales factor and when we
 
00:41:02.329 --> 00:41:02.339 align:start position:0%
looked at single sales Factor even under
 
00:41:04.490 --> 00:41:04.500 align:start position:0%
market-based sourcing or under excuse me
 
00:41:06.230 --> 00:41:06.240 align:start position:0%
under cost of performance
 
00:41:07.910 --> 00:41:07.920 align:start position:0%
there are years where single sales
 
00:41:09.710 --> 00:41:09.720 align:start position:0%
Factor would be a winner and there are
 
00:41:11.569 --> 00:41:11.579 align:start position:0%
years that it would be a loser it really
 
00:41:13.670 --> 00:41:13.680 align:start position:0%
just depends some years we would gain
 
00:41:15.410 --> 00:41:15.420 align:start position:0%
revenue moving to single sales Factor
 
00:41:17.450 --> 00:41:17.460 align:start position:0%
other years we would lose Revenue moving
 
00:41:20.569 --> 00:41:20.579 align:start position:0%
to single sales Factor so it is could be
 
00:41:22.190 --> 00:41:22.200 align:start position:0%
very specific to the year and the
 
00:41:23.630 --> 00:41:23.640 align:start position:0%
specific businesses and the activity
 
00:41:26.150 --> 00:41:26.160 align:start position:0%
occurring in that year so we did not we
 
00:41:28.490 --> 00:41:28.500 align:start position:0%
are unable to describe prescribe any
 
00:41:30.589 --> 00:41:30.599 align:start position:0%
specific amount to that
 
00:41:35.089 --> 00:41:35.099 align:start position:0%
follow-up yes but the last uh
 
00:41:37.990 --> 00:41:38.000 align:start position:0%
of those estimates from before
 
00:41:41.030 --> 00:41:41.040 align:start position:0%
market-based sourcing that you ran for
 
00:41:44.630 --> 00:41:44.640 align:start position:0%
us on was after the decision on that I
 
00:41:47.030 --> 00:41:47.040 align:start position:0%
believe but the month after that
 
00:41:52.069 --> 00:41:52.079 align:start position:0%
decision but it came in at 70 million
 
00:41:55.790 --> 00:41:55.800 align:start position:0%
dollars loss in 2016. for that specific
 
00:41:59.630 --> 00:41:59.640 align:start position:0%
Year and that was a big tax year
 
00:42:02.329 --> 00:42:02.339 align:start position:0%
and the question now that we're we've
 
00:42:04.849 --> 00:42:04.859 align:start position:0%
we've got two big tax years
 
00:42:08.569 --> 00:42:08.579 align:start position:0%
going now right behind us
 
00:42:11.270 --> 00:42:11.280 align:start position:0%
on it's a little worrying how much it
 
00:42:12.650 --> 00:42:12.660 align:start position:0%
might end up being
 
00:42:16.069 --> 00:42:16.079 align:start position:0%
I I would just say I don't think that
 
00:42:19.550 --> 00:42:19.560 align:start position:0%
the loss of 70 million
 
00:42:22.190 --> 00:42:22.200 align:start position:0%
in a big tax year I don't think the big
 
00:42:24.950 --> 00:42:24.960 align:start position:0%
tax year is necessarily driving the loss
 
00:42:26.690 --> 00:42:26.700 align:start position:0%
it's the type of activities and the
 
00:42:29.030 --> 00:42:29.040 align:start position:0%
businesses paying those taxes in that
 
00:42:32.089 --> 00:42:32.099 align:start position:0%
year that determine the impact so you
 
00:42:34.490 --> 00:42:34.500 align:start position:0%
could also have in theory a big tax year
 
00:42:36.829 --> 00:42:36.839 align:start position:0%
where the move to single sales Factor
 
00:42:39.109 --> 00:42:39.119 align:start position:0%
generated revenue and we saw gains in
 
00:42:41.810 --> 00:42:41.820 align:start position:0%
Revenue if the large business taxpayers
 
00:42:44.810 --> 00:42:44.820 align:start position:0%
in that year had a significant portion
 
00:42:46.910 --> 00:42:46.920 align:start position:0%
of sales in New Hampshire
 
00:42:49.190 --> 00:42:49.200 align:start position:0%
so it really depends on the underlying
 
00:42:58.130 --> 00:42:58.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:00.290 --> 00:43:00.300 align:start position:0%
yeah just keep in mind let me just
 
00:43:02.089 --> 00:43:02.099 align:start position:0%
remind everyone that we have another
 
00:43:03.890 --> 00:43:03.900 align:start position:0%
presentation right after the governor's
 
00:43:07.010 --> 00:43:07.020 align:start position:0%
office and then uh we have we have
 
00:43:09.530 --> 00:43:09.540 align:start position:0%
Lindsay for a commissioner
 
00:43:11.270 --> 00:43:11.280 align:start position:0%
um for the rest of the day basically so
 
00:43:13.370 --> 00:43:13.380 align:start position:0%
we can keep asking her questions we can
 
00:43:15.050 --> 00:43:15.060 align:start position:0%
keep going on that one then or I could
 
00:43:16.790 --> 00:43:16.800 align:start position:0%
just ask this one more question one more
 
00:43:19.970 --> 00:43:19.980 align:start position:0%
question okay on
 
00:43:23.450 --> 00:43:23.460 align:start position:0%
we are an elderly Society we consume
 
00:43:25.609 --> 00:43:25.619 align:start position:0%
less than young societies
 
00:43:30.470 --> 00:43:30.480 align:start position:0%
and uh we we
 
00:43:34.309 --> 00:43:34.319 align:start position:0%
on in General on the consumer side we're
 
00:43:36.589 --> 00:43:36.599 align:start position:0%
not going to get as much as other states
 
00:43:40.130 --> 00:43:40.140 align:start position:0%
would out of this but on the and on the
 
00:43:43.250 --> 00:43:43.260 align:start position:0%
manufacturing side the businesses that I
 
00:43:47.589 --> 00:43:47.599 align:start position:0%
know that do production are
 
00:43:47.599 --> 00:43:49.309 align:start position:0%
know that do production are
mostly

00:43:49.309 --> 00:43:49.319 align:start position:0%
mostly
 
00:43:49.319 --> 00:43:49.910 align:start position:0%
mostly
um

00:43:49.910 --> 00:43:49.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:43:52.670 --> 00:43:52.680 align:start position:0%
not importing a whole lot of inputs and
 
00:43:53.870 --> 00:43:53.880 align:start position:0%
selling them
 
00:43:58.370 --> 00:43:58.380 align:start position:0%
out of New Hampshire so do you but do
 
00:43:59.809 --> 00:43:59.819 align:start position:0%
you have any
 
00:44:03.050 --> 00:44:03.060 align:start position:0%
better take on that
 
00:44:06.410 --> 00:44:06.420 align:start position:0%
I think in terms of consumption as a
 
00:44:09.650 --> 00:44:09.660 align:start position:0%
society I think it depends on what
 
00:44:11.089 --> 00:44:11.099 align:start position:0%
you're consuming
 
00:44:13.849 --> 00:44:13.859 align:start position:0%
so different demographics consume
 
00:44:16.630 --> 00:44:16.640 align:start position:0%
different types of things
 
00:44:19.849 --> 00:44:19.859 align:start position:0%
as you age you may consume more Medical
 
00:44:23.329 --> 00:44:23.339 align:start position:0%
Services or medical devices when you're
 
00:44:26.690 --> 00:44:26.700 align:start position:0%
younger you may consume we don't collect
 
00:44:28.670 --> 00:44:28.680 align:start position:0%
the beer tax but you may consume more
 
00:44:32.569 --> 00:44:32.579 align:start position:0%
beer and pay tax on that so I think
 
00:44:34.309 --> 00:44:34.319 align:start position:0%
at the end of the day there is a
 
00:44:36.770 --> 00:44:36.780 align:start position:0%
consumption across Society it's just
 
00:44:40.130 --> 00:44:40.140 align:start position:0%
what you consume might be different but
 
00:44:41.510 --> 00:44:41.520 align:start position:0%
at the end of the day single sales
 
00:44:43.790 --> 00:44:43.800 align:start position:0%
Factor just looks at the sales into the
 
00:44:46.069 --> 00:44:46.079 align:start position:0%
state and it's all kind of taxed
 
00:44:56.450 --> 00:44:56.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:58.490 --> 00:44:58.500 align:start position:0%
it's always great to be reunited with my
 
00:45:02.150 --> 00:45:02.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:06.530 --> 00:45:06.540 align:start position:0%
okay it was on on page four uh again we
 
00:45:08.930 --> 00:45:08.940 align:start position:0%
have the the the problem the problem of
 
00:45:11.089 --> 00:45:11.099 align:start position:0%
the real estate transfer attacks and
 
00:45:13.730 --> 00:45:13.740 align:start position:0%
again are based off of the current
 
00:45:17.109 --> 00:45:17.119 align:start position:0%
projections uh from January and February
 
00:45:22.069 --> 00:45:22.079 align:start position:0%
our number is too high and the 227
 
00:45:25.730 --> 00:45:25.740 align:start position:0%
million that the dra is projecting
 
00:45:28.609 --> 00:45:28.619 align:start position:0%
um is is controlling
 
00:45:32.089 --> 00:45:32.099 align:start position:0%
uh just going down the list the Court's
 
00:45:34.569 --> 00:45:34.579 align:start position:0%
fines and fees they're pretty much
 
00:45:37.910 --> 00:45:37.920 align:start position:0%
statistically insignificant we have uh
 
00:45:41.329 --> 00:45:41.339 align:start position:0%
14 million they have 13.9 million
 
00:45:43.790 --> 00:45:43.800 align:start position:0%
um for a simplicity's sake uh I mean
 
00:45:45.530 --> 00:45:45.540 align:start position:0%
either number it's not going to matter
 
00:45:47.990 --> 00:45:48.000 align:start position:0%
but if you want to use theirs so we can
 
00:45:49.609 --> 00:45:49.619 align:start position:0%
consistently say we use the Department's
 
00:45:52.630 --> 00:45:52.640 align:start position:0%
estimates the 13.9 would be fine with us
 
00:45:56.089 --> 00:45:56.099 align:start position:0%
uh the utility property taxes uh they're
 
00:45:58.790 --> 00:45:58.800 align:start position:0%
coming more and more in line in 2024
 
00:46:02.930 --> 00:46:02.940 align:start position:0%
we're just 1.7 percent off of the dra uh
 
00:46:06.309 --> 00:46:06.319 align:start position:0%
revenues we're at 47.1 they're at 46.3
 
00:46:10.010 --> 00:46:10.020 align:start position:0%
uh I like our number
 
00:46:12.530 --> 00:46:12.540 align:start position:0%
um I'm just sort of a a nudge to get
 
00:46:15.470 --> 00:46:15.480 align:start position:0%
those utility values up
 
00:46:18.410 --> 00:46:18.420 align:start position:0%
um but uh I I think you know a lot of
 
00:46:20.390 --> 00:46:20.400 align:start position:0%
it's going to be what what transpires
 
00:46:23.030 --> 00:46:23.040 align:start position:0%
over the next few months but uh April
 
00:46:26.030 --> 00:46:26.040 align:start position:0%
1st is coming around uh the utility
 
00:46:28.670 --> 00:46:28.680 align:start position:0%
profits uh their profitability has
 
00:46:31.790 --> 00:46:31.800 align:start position:0%
skyrocketed uh in the last year and I
 
00:46:32.930 --> 00:46:32.940 align:start position:0%
think those numbers are going to be
 
00:46:36.650 --> 00:46:36.660 align:start position:0%
reflected uh with a with a with a better
 
00:46:39.650 --> 00:46:39.660 align:start position:0%
utility property tax uh although again
 
00:46:41.450 --> 00:46:41.460 align:start position:0%
our numbers are are getting more and
 
00:46:44.510 --> 00:46:44.520 align:start position:0%
more in line in in very close and the
 
00:46:47.329 --> 00:46:47.339 align:start position:0%
last one on the page is recoveries
 
00:46:47.339 --> 00:46:47.930 align:start position:0%
last one on the page is recoveries
um

00:46:47.930 --> 00:46:47.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:46:50.030 --> 00:46:50.040 align:start position:0%
recoveries are always very difficult to
 
00:46:52.309 --> 00:46:52.319 align:start position:0%
estimate estimate however in the last
 
00:46:55.010 --> 00:46:55.020 align:start position:0%
three years recoveries have averaged 3.4
 
00:46:57.589 --> 00:46:57.599 align:start position:0%
million dollars a year
 
00:47:00.530 --> 00:47:00.540 align:start position:0%
um the the plan was for 2.5 million
 
00:47:01.790 --> 00:47:01.800 align:start position:0%
they're always they're going to be
 
00:47:03.290 --> 00:47:03.300 align:start position:0%
between and historically they've always
 
00:47:06.349 --> 00:47:06.359 align:start position:0%
been between 2 million and 4 million uh
 
00:47:08.750 --> 00:47:08.760 align:start position:0%
so 2.5 million that we're projecting is
 
00:47:10.849 --> 00:47:10.859 align:start position:0%
on the lower end their 2 million is on
 
00:47:13.130 --> 00:47:13.140 align:start position:0%
the very low end again Anything could
 
00:47:14.630 --> 00:47:14.640 align:start position:0%
happen it's all has to do with what the
 
00:47:18.950 --> 00:47:18.960 align:start position:0%
courts say but I believe the 200 the 2.5
 
00:47:21.349 --> 00:47:21.359 align:start position:0%
million dollars that we're projecting is
 
00:47:24.109 --> 00:47:24.119 align:start position:0%
the right number to use
 
00:47:25.910 --> 00:47:25.920 align:start position:0%
I'm Adam cheer
 
00:47:25.920 --> 00:47:29.089 align:start position:0%
I'm Adam cheer
yes

00:47:29.089 --> 00:47:29.099 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:32.930 --> 00:47:32.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:39.230 --> 00:47:39.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:39.240 --> 00:47:43.430 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:47:43.430 --> 00:47:43.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:46.250 --> 00:47:46.260 align:start position:0%
for 24.
 
00:47:48.650 --> 00:47:48.660 align:start position:0%
yeah that one we we are we are we are
 
00:47:50.270 --> 00:47:50.280 align:start position:0%
lower than that
 
00:47:55.069 --> 00:47:55.079 align:start position:0%
um lower than the uh the dra's estimate
 
00:47:58.970 --> 00:47:58.980 align:start position:0%
uh again based on on timing and those
 
00:48:00.829 --> 00:48:00.839 align:start position:0%
revenues we believe the dra number is
 
00:48:04.130 --> 00:48:04.140 align:start position:0%
correct to the 100.93 yeah we were we
 
00:48:07.849 --> 00:48:07.859 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:10.190 --> 00:48:10.200 align:start position:0%
can you go back to something you said
 
00:48:13.490 --> 00:48:13.500 align:start position:0%
just got me confused uh utility profits
 
00:48:15.710 --> 00:48:15.720 align:start position:0%
have skyrocketed
 
00:48:18.550 --> 00:48:18.560 align:start position:0%
can you tell talk to us about that why
 
00:48:22.250 --> 00:48:22.260 align:start position:0%
uh yeah well without uh that's what it's
 
00:48:25.730 --> 00:48:25.740 align:start position:0%
it's what I've I've looked at uh reports
 
00:48:27.970 --> 00:48:27.980 align:start position:0%
for for eversource and some of the other
 
00:48:31.130 --> 00:48:31.140 align:start position:0%
companies and their profits are up
 
00:48:34.849 --> 00:48:34.859 align:start position:0%
significantly and uh the utility
 
00:48:36.650 --> 00:48:36.660 align:start position:0%
property tax is based off of the market
 
00:48:39.829 --> 00:48:39.839 align:start position:0%
value of what a utility is worth it's
 
00:48:43.569 --> 00:48:43.579 align:start position:0%
what a what a uh
 
00:48:46.490 --> 00:48:46.500 align:start position:0%
non-related party would would buy the
 
00:48:48.650 --> 00:48:48.660 align:start position:0%
utility for if it was at an arms Lake
 
00:48:50.410 --> 00:48:50.420 align:start position:0%
transaction on the open market
 
00:48:55.010 --> 00:48:55.020 align:start position:0%
and uh the more profitable a utility is
 
00:48:56.690 --> 00:48:56.700 align:start position:0%
the higher the value is therefore the
 
00:48:58.730 --> 00:48:58.740 align:start position:0%
higher the assessed value should be
 
00:49:02.030 --> 00:49:02.040 align:start position:0%
so increased profitability while maybe
 
00:49:04.490 --> 00:49:04.500 align:start position:0%
not good for consumers is very good for
 
00:49:06.710 --> 00:49:06.720 align:start position:0%
utility property tax collection and
 
00:49:11.410 --> 00:49:11.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:14.690 --> 00:49:14.700 align:start position:0%
representative Doucet just curious in
 
00:49:16.910 --> 00:49:16.920 align:start position:0%
that explanation does that mean the the
 
00:49:19.790 --> 00:49:19.800 align:start position:0%
property the real property in relation
 
00:49:22.010 --> 00:49:22.020 align:start position:0%
to the uh utility
 
00:49:25.490 --> 00:49:25.500 align:start position:0%
isn't necessarily said it's fluid as to
 
00:49:28.250 --> 00:49:28.260 align:start position:0%
what their profit line is yes
 
00:49:32.450 --> 00:49:32.460 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah I mean businesses are assessed
 
00:49:34.490 --> 00:49:34.500 align:start position:0%
differently than than you would be as a
 
00:49:35.930 --> 00:49:35.940 align:start position:0%
homeowner your homeowner is like what is
 
00:49:37.790 --> 00:49:37.800 align:start position:0%
the value what is the market value of
 
00:49:40.730 --> 00:49:40.740 align:start position:0%
your house whereas a uh and it's based
 
00:49:42.410 --> 00:49:42.420 align:start position:0%
off of what you could sell the land for
 
00:49:44.990 --> 00:49:45.000 align:start position:0%
and the improvements for whereas a
 
00:49:47.150 --> 00:49:47.160 align:start position:0%
business it it's it's sold as an ongoing
 
00:49:49.670 --> 00:49:49.680 align:start position:0%
concern so there's a revenue stream
 
00:49:53.150 --> 00:49:53.160 align:start position:0%
attached to it that's projected out and
 
00:49:56.630 --> 00:49:56.640 align:start position:0%
those uh are taken into account when
 
00:49:59.930 --> 00:49:59.940 align:start position:0%
assessing for uh for property tax
 
00:49:59.940 --> 00:50:02.870 align:start position:0%
assessing for uh for property tax
purposes

00:50:02.870 --> 00:50:02.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:06.170 --> 00:50:06.180 align:start position:0%
how often does that occur every quarter
 
00:50:09.410 --> 00:50:09.420 align:start position:0%
every fiscal year once a year okay thank
 
00:50:11.270 --> 00:50:11.280 align:start position:0%
you once a year it's assessed as of
 
00:50:13.490 --> 00:50:13.500 align:start position:0%
April 1st or the assessments are based
 
00:50:15.950 --> 00:50:15.960 align:start position:0%
on what the value is on April 1st not
 
00:50:19.670 --> 00:50:19.680 align:start position:0%
March 30th not April 2nd April 1st and
 
00:50:23.569 --> 00:50:23.579 align:start position:0%
and they are released uh by December
 
00:50:25.490 --> 00:50:25.500 align:start position:0%
15th of that following year or that same
 
00:50:25.500 --> 00:50:26.329 align:start position:0%
15th of that following year or that same
year

00:50:26.329 --> 00:50:26.339 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:50:28.790 --> 00:50:28.800 align:start position:0%
Madam chair uh representative Platt then
 
00:50:30.410 --> 00:50:30.420 align:start position:0%
all me and then we'll keep going okay
 
00:50:32.930 --> 00:50:32.940 align:start position:0%
great thank you
 
00:50:36.530 --> 00:50:36.540 align:start position:0%
is it's strictly based on a profit index
 
00:50:38.390 --> 00:50:38.400 align:start position:0%
or is there some net book thrown in
 
00:50:40.490 --> 00:50:40.500 align:start position:0%
there is a Formula that blends a few
 
00:50:43.370 --> 00:50:43.380 align:start position:0%
different approaches uh yeah I I know
 
00:50:45.710 --> 00:50:45.720 align:start position:0%
the dra has a very complicated model
 
00:50:47.990 --> 00:50:48.000 align:start position:0%
that that brings into account a number
 
00:50:52.130 --> 00:50:52.140 align:start position:0%
of factors uh which includes uh which
 
00:50:54.290 --> 00:50:54.300 align:start position:0%
includes the book value Revenue
 
00:50:56.450 --> 00:50:56.460 align:start position:0%
projection streams as well as the
 
00:50:59.210 --> 00:50:59.220 align:start position:0%
physical plant that's that's there so
 
00:51:01.250 --> 00:51:01.260 align:start position:0%
it's a combination of of many different
 
00:51:03.770 --> 00:51:03.780 align:start position:0%
factors that go into disclosure that's
 
00:51:06.890 --> 00:51:06.900 align:start position:0%
the industry I came from
 
00:51:09.230 --> 00:51:09.240 align:start position:0%
okay representative only
 
00:51:12.770 --> 00:51:12.780 align:start position:0%
thank you um but to the extent that it's
 
00:51:16.609 --> 00:51:16.619 align:start position:0%
based on profit on they're at a high
 
00:51:19.370 --> 00:51:19.380 align:start position:0%
right now because they are required to
 
00:51:23.210 --> 00:51:23.220 align:start position:0%
set the prices once every six months no
 
00:51:25.730 --> 00:51:25.740 align:start position:0%
matter whether the Market's up or down
 
00:51:25.740 --> 00:51:27.230 align:start position:0%
matter whether the Market's up or down
and

00:51:27.230 --> 00:51:27.240 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:51:29.150 --> 00:51:29.160 align:start position:0%
um The Cooperative New Hampshire
 
00:51:31.970 --> 00:51:31.980 align:start position:0%
Cooperative actually has considerably
 
00:51:34.370 --> 00:51:34.380 align:start position:0%
lower prices because they can set them
 
00:51:36.730 --> 00:51:36.740 align:start position:0%
when the market looks good
 
00:51:40.010 --> 00:51:40.020 align:start position:0%
and do it whenever they want to
 
00:51:44.150 --> 00:51:44.160 align:start position:0%
and the new community energy groups are
 
00:51:46.370 --> 00:51:46.380 align:start position:0%
going to be doing pretty much that same
 
00:51:49.210 --> 00:51:49.220 align:start position:0%
thing so
 
00:51:52.990 --> 00:51:53.000 align:start position:0%
and I understand that
 
00:51:57.049 --> 00:51:57.059 align:start position:0%
the puc and the department of energy are
 
00:51:59.450 --> 00:51:59.460 align:start position:0%
working hard at this point on whether
 
00:52:03.290 --> 00:52:03.300 align:start position:0%
they can use a modified version of what
 
00:52:05.390 --> 00:52:05.400 align:start position:0%
the Cooperative does
 
00:52:07.190 --> 00:52:07.200 align:start position:0%
as well which would bring down the
 
00:52:08.690 --> 00:52:08.700 align:start position:0%
prices which would bring down the
 
00:52:13.490 --> 00:52:13.500 align:start position:0%
profits which by 25 we'd probably see a
 
00:52:17.270 --> 00:52:17.280 align:start position:0%
decline in that yes uh it's possible but
 
00:52:18.770 --> 00:52:18.780 align:start position:0%
first they're going to go up
 
00:52:20.930 --> 00:52:20.940 align:start position:0%
and uh they're not going to get well
 
00:52:22.250 --> 00:52:22.260 align:start position:0%
they may do that they're not going to
 
00:52:24.170 --> 00:52:24.180 align:start position:0%
get it done unfortunately before April
 
00:52:27.230 --> 00:52:27.240 align:start position:0%
1st and that's that's the next time the
 
00:52:28.970 --> 00:52:28.980 align:start position:0%
revenues are the assessments are going
 
00:52:29.930 --> 00:52:29.940 align:start position:0%
to be made
 
00:52:33.230 --> 00:52:33.240 align:start position:0%
uh so which is which is why uh and
 
00:52:35.210 --> 00:52:35.220 align:start position:0%
you're right that it's not going it
 
00:52:39.049 --> 00:52:39.059 align:start position:0%
doesn't it hasn't affected all
 
00:52:42.010 --> 00:52:42.020 align:start position:0%
utility providers equally
 
00:52:44.690 --> 00:52:44.700 align:start position:0%
uh so which is why we don't have we
 
00:52:46.490 --> 00:52:46.500 align:start position:0%
don't see Revenue skyrocketing I mean
 
00:52:49.309 --> 00:52:49.319 align:start position:0%
our our numbers while slightly higher
 
00:52:53.150 --> 00:52:53.160 align:start position:0%
than the dra in in 24 and they by the
 
00:52:55.970 --> 00:52:55.980 align:start position:0%
way they come back in line in 25. uh
 
00:52:57.650 --> 00:52:57.660 align:start position:0%
they do see a little bit of a spike
 
00:52:59.930 --> 00:52:59.940 align:start position:0%
there because of that and then long term
 
00:53:01.370 --> 00:53:01.380 align:start position:0%
I think you're you're exactly right
 
00:53:03.290 --> 00:53:03.300 align:start position:0%
they'll come back down
 
00:53:06.230 --> 00:53:06.240 align:start position:0%
in in line representative Southworth did
 
00:53:08.390 --> 00:53:08.400 align:start position:0%
you have a question uh thank you maybe
 
00:53:11.270 --> 00:53:11.280 align:start position:0%
my own confusion uh we said we were very
 
00:53:14.089 --> 00:53:14.099 align:start position:0%
optimistic about meals and rentals
 
00:53:16.010 --> 00:53:16.020 align:start position:0%
am I misreading
 
00:53:19.609 --> 00:53:19.619 align:start position:0%
um your estimates are much lower than
 
00:53:22.549 --> 00:53:22.559 align:start position:0%
um the department for both 24 uh for
 
00:53:25.970 --> 00:53:25.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:28.150 --> 00:53:28.160 align:start position:0%
I don't I thought if you were very
 
00:53:30.410 --> 00:53:30.420 align:start position:0%
optimistic you'd be closer to the
 
00:53:33.170 --> 00:53:33.180 align:start position:0%
department asked him yeah uh we are
 
00:53:37.089 --> 00:53:37.099 align:start position:0%
optimistic uh we want to make it uh
 
00:53:40.609 --> 00:53:40.619 align:start position:0%
realistic and and Bible so while we're
 
00:53:43.549 --> 00:53:43.559 align:start position:0%
where we are within their range for
 
00:53:45.109 --> 00:53:45.119 align:start position:0%
meals and rentals we are at the low end
 
00:53:47.630 --> 00:53:47.640 align:start position:0%
of the range okay I miss that so that's
 
00:53:49.130 --> 00:53:49.140 align:start position:0%
there's a little twist there somewhere
 
00:53:51.349 --> 00:53:51.359 align:start position:0%
yeah so we're within the range it's just
 
00:53:55.130 --> 00:53:55.140 align:start position:0%
a matter of how much we want to uh and
 
00:53:58.069 --> 00:53:58.079 align:start position:0%
can you bring it not to belabor it but
 
00:53:59.990 --> 00:54:00.000 align:start position:0%
um that doesn't really seem to fit with
 
00:54:01.609 --> 00:54:01.619 align:start position:0%
very optimistic
 
00:54:03.349 --> 00:54:03.359 align:start position:0%
well I think that the growth rates
 
00:54:05.950 --> 00:54:05.960 align:start position:0%
though are are are are are are
 
00:54:10.190 --> 00:54:10.200 align:start position:0%
optimistic oh so you think it's peaking
 
00:54:13.309 --> 00:54:13.319 align:start position:0%
um yeah I mean it's you think it's going
 
00:54:15.349 --> 00:54:15.359 align:start position:0%
to flatten they're at an all-time high
 
00:54:17.990 --> 00:54:18.000 align:start position:0%
and I think that they're going to remain
 
00:54:19.970 --> 00:54:19.980 align:start position:0%
at an all-time high okay they're not
 
00:54:21.589 --> 00:54:21.599 align:start position:0%
going to that makes sense thank you all
 
00:54:26.870 --> 00:54:26.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:29.450 --> 00:54:29.460 align:start position:0%
representative Platt
 
00:54:32.390 --> 00:54:32.400 align:start position:0%
who does the utility property tax apply
 
00:54:35.030 --> 00:54:35.040 align:start position:0%
to it's not just polls and wires as it
 
00:54:36.890 --> 00:54:36.900 align:start position:0%
generators as well it is actually
 
00:54:39.230 --> 00:54:39.240 align:start position:0%
generators yes okay because uh I was
 
00:54:41.770 --> 00:54:41.780 align:start position:0%
going to respond to representative Olney
 
00:54:45.109 --> 00:54:45.119 align:start position:0%
because uh the energy part is just a
 
00:54:46.309 --> 00:54:46.319 align:start position:0%
pass-through so it doesn't affect
 
00:54:48.530 --> 00:54:48.540 align:start position:0%
utility profits at all but it does
 
00:54:51.349 --> 00:54:51.359 align:start position:0%
affect the generators profits if they're
 
00:54:54.230 --> 00:54:54.240 align:start position:0%
taxed on utility property tax that that
 
00:54:56.270 --> 00:54:56.280 align:start position:0%
will go up but the utilities themselves
 
00:54:58.790 --> 00:54:58.800 align:start position:0%
the only reason they might have a higher
 
00:55:00.650 --> 00:55:00.660 align:start position:0%
profit now because kilowatt hours are up
 
00:55:03.230 --> 00:55:03.240 align:start position:0%
and they're collecting revenues on a
 
00:55:05.150 --> 00:55:05.160 align:start position:0%
kilowatt hour basis for a fixed cost so
 
00:55:07.130 --> 00:55:07.140 align:start position:0%
it gets better with revenues and of
 
00:55:09.069 --> 00:55:09.079 align:start position:0%
kilowatt hours and we'll go down
 
00:55:11.150 --> 00:55:11.160 align:start position:0%
kilowatt hours go down is that correct
 
00:55:11.160 --> 00:55:14.170 align:start position:0%
kilowatt hours go down is that correct
yes

00:55:14.170 --> 00:55:14.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:16.309 --> 00:55:16.319 align:start position:0%
representative Phyllis
 
00:55:18.710 --> 00:55:18.720 align:start position:0%
so just so I understand this utility
 
00:55:21.230 --> 00:55:21.240 align:start position:0%
property tax it's
 
00:55:25.910 --> 00:55:25.920 align:start position:0%
this one the state revenue is the method
 
00:55:28.990 --> 00:55:29.000 align:start position:0%
of assessing them in taxing them
 
00:55:30.950 --> 00:55:30.960 align:start position:0%
completely different from what
 
00:55:33.470 --> 00:55:33.480 align:start position:0%
municipalities do
 
00:55:36.530 --> 00:55:36.540 align:start position:0%
no it's not they they they they assessed
 
00:55:38.569 --> 00:55:38.579 align:start position:0%
or they they should be assessing on on
 
00:55:41.569 --> 00:55:41.579 align:start position:0%
the same on the same way uh how a
 
00:55:44.630 --> 00:55:44.640 align:start position:0%
municipality assesses a utility should
 
00:55:47.990 --> 00:55:48.000 align:start position:0%
be the exact same way a dra uh
 
00:55:49.730 --> 00:55:49.740 align:start position:0%
assessment when I say exact same way and
 
00:55:51.170 --> 00:55:51.180 align:start position:0%
generally the same way because there's
 
00:55:53.569 --> 00:55:53.579 align:start position:0%
more than one way to do it uh but they
 
00:55:55.190 --> 00:55:55.200 align:start position:0%
should be very similar and they they
 
00:55:58.690 --> 00:55:58.700 align:start position:0%
should in theory produce similar values
 
00:56:02.750 --> 00:56:02.760 align:start position:0%
uh and what what we have is is the the
 
00:56:05.569 --> 00:56:05.579 align:start position:0%
dra assesses utility companies
 
00:56:06.530 --> 00:56:06.540 align:start position:0%
throughout the state of New Hampshire
 
00:56:09.049 --> 00:56:09.059 align:start position:0%
for the utility property tax there are
 
00:56:11.990 --> 00:56:12.000 align:start position:0%
also utility property tax or taxes paid
 
00:56:13.430 --> 00:56:13.440 align:start position:0%
on the local level
 
00:56:16.069 --> 00:56:16.079 align:start position:0%
uh and the and those municipalities have
 
00:56:17.750 --> 00:56:17.760 align:start position:0%
two choices one is they could use the
 
00:56:19.549 --> 00:56:19.559 align:start position:0%
dra revenues
 
00:56:21.530 --> 00:56:21.540 align:start position:0%
uh which which the dra provides them
 
00:56:23.329 --> 00:56:23.339 align:start position:0%
free of free of charge they can just
 
00:56:26.030 --> 00:56:26.040 align:start position:0%
give them to them or they can uh hire
 
00:56:28.849 --> 00:56:28.859 align:start position:0%
their their own uh Municipal assessing
 
00:56:33.049 --> 00:56:33.059 align:start position:0%
expert to assess the utilities uh or or
 
00:56:36.410 --> 00:56:36.420 align:start position:0%
contract with a private company to do so
 
00:56:40.010 --> 00:56:40.020 align:start position:0%
but but it it it is the for the local
 
00:56:42.950 --> 00:56:42.960 align:start position:0%
property tax uh they are assessed Maybe
 
00:56:45.049 --> 00:56:45.059 align:start position:0%
by a different company which most of
 
00:56:47.270 --> 00:56:47.280 align:start position:0%
them are than the dra the dra is
 
00:56:49.130 --> 00:56:49.140 align:start position:0%
strictly for the Statewide utility
 
00:56:52.069 --> 00:56:52.079 align:start position:0%
property tax why don't we this is kind
 
00:56:54.109 --> 00:56:54.119 align:start position:0%
of drilling down to an expertise that
 
00:56:56.270 --> 00:56:56.280 align:start position:0%
the dra would have
 
00:56:57.829 --> 00:56:57.839 align:start position:0%
um so why don't we keep moving because
 
00:56:59.329 --> 00:56:59.339 align:start position:0%
we want to hear what the governor's
 
00:57:01.790 --> 00:57:01.800 align:start position:0%
logic was in all of these numbers and
 
00:57:04.190 --> 00:57:04.200 align:start position:0%
then we can go back to that okay thank
 
00:57:04.200 --> 00:57:05.870 align:start position:0%
then we can go back to that okay thank
you

00:57:05.870 --> 00:57:05.880 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:57:05.880 --> 00:57:08.230 align:start position:0%
you
right

00:57:08.230 --> 00:57:08.240 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:57:10.849 --> 00:57:10.859 align:start position:0%
uh now turning to I'm actually now
 
00:57:17.230 --> 00:57:17.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:19.609 --> 00:57:19.619 align:start position:0%
and you see here that there are no new
 
00:57:21.849 --> 00:57:21.859 align:start position:0%
items that stand out
 
00:57:25.609 --> 00:57:25.619 align:start position:0%
and that the uh that are upt number the
 
00:57:28.069 --> 00:57:28.079 align:start position:0%
utility property tax number is is now in
 
00:57:31.609 --> 00:57:31.619 align:start position:0%
back in line with the dra estimates
 
00:57:33.950 --> 00:57:33.960 align:start position:0%
because they they believe that you know
 
00:57:37.910 --> 00:57:37.920 align:start position:0%
the the numbers going up as do we uh and
 
00:57:40.670 --> 00:57:40.680 align:start position:0%
in total our revenues are 4.5 percent
 
00:57:43.370 --> 00:57:43.380 align:start position:0%
lower than those provided by the
 
00:57:44.750 --> 00:57:44.760 align:start position:0%
Departments with the caveat again has
 
00:57:46.790 --> 00:57:46.800 align:start position:0%
been pointed out we did take for for
 
00:57:48.470 --> 00:57:48.480 align:start position:0%
some of these at least the high end of
 
00:57:50.390 --> 00:57:50.400 align:start position:0%
the dra range although that that
 
00:57:58.490 --> 00:57:58.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:00.069 --> 00:58:00.079 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:58:00.079 --> 00:58:02.230 align:start position:0%
thank you
sorry

00:58:02.230 --> 00:58:02.240 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
00:58:05.150 --> 00:58:05.160 align:start position:0%
yes sir are you thinking um the real
 
00:58:07.670 --> 00:58:07.680 align:start position:0%
estate property tax again will be closer
 
00:58:10.490 --> 00:58:10.500 align:start position:0%
to the department absolutely okay yeah
 
00:58:14.390 --> 00:58:14.400 align:start position:0%
that take take the dras we we uh we're
 
00:58:17.930 --> 00:58:17.940 align:start position:0%
relying on December numbers and uh you
 
00:58:19.130 --> 00:58:19.140 align:start position:0%
know given what's happened in January
 
00:58:20.930 --> 00:58:20.940 align:start position:0%
and February belonging the December
 
00:58:23.870 --> 00:58:23.880 align:start position:0%
numbers was a mistake and the dra's
 
00:58:25.609 --> 00:58:25.619 align:start position:0%
latest numbers are the ones that we
 
00:58:28.309 --> 00:58:28.319 align:start position:0%
believe are correct that would extend to
 
00:58:30.410 --> 00:58:30.420 align:start position:0%
2024 and 25 as well that all those
 
00:58:32.329 --> 00:58:32.339 align:start position:0%
numbers will be put in hours eventually
 
00:58:34.790 --> 00:58:34.800 align:start position:0%
that have been changed
 
00:58:37.970 --> 00:58:37.980 align:start position:0%
for our sheets
 
00:58:39.710 --> 00:58:39.720 align:start position:0%
I mean he's reading us the new numbers
 
00:58:41.450 --> 00:58:41.460 align:start position:0%
for those are eventually going to go in
 
00:58:46.309 --> 00:58:46.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:48.710 --> 00:58:48.720 align:start position:0%
so no the the official Governor's
 
00:58:50.030 --> 00:58:50.040 align:start position:0%
numbers are the ones that are in your
 
00:58:52.190 --> 00:58:52.200 align:start position:0%
sheet the numbers that were contained in
 
00:58:55.250 --> 00:58:55.260 align:start position:0%
the summary okay so what since that
 
00:58:57.470 --> 00:58:57.480 align:start position:0%
point in time
 
00:58:59.690 --> 00:58:59.700 align:start position:0%
the director Gary is letting you know
 
00:59:01.789 --> 00:59:01.799 align:start position:0%
that if they had done revenues today
 
00:59:03.230 --> 00:59:03.240 align:start position:0%
they would have okay probably done
 
00:59:04.670 --> 00:59:04.680 align:start position:0%
something differently but the governor's
 
00:59:06.349 --> 00:59:06.359 align:start position:0%
official numbers are the governor's
 
00:59:07.970 --> 00:59:07.980 align:start position:0%
officials okay and we can just know it
 
00:59:10.190 --> 00:59:10.200 align:start position:0%
for our information right thank you
 
00:59:11.930 --> 00:59:11.940 align:start position:0%
yeah it's true the the numbers are the
 
00:59:13.730 --> 00:59:13.740 align:start position:0%
numbers but I want to make sure that you
 
00:59:16.010 --> 00:59:16.020 align:start position:0%
know where we stand so you can get your
 
00:59:18.170 --> 00:59:18.180 align:start position:0%
numbers so I'll you know with the same
 
00:59:22.789 --> 00:59:22.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:26.930 --> 00:59:26.940 align:start position:0%
now on page six uh page six and seven
 
00:59:29.089 --> 00:59:29.099 align:start position:0%
just to end we have the highway uh the
 
00:59:31.190 --> 00:59:31.200 align:start position:0%
highway fund and and Fish and Game fund
 
00:59:33.770 --> 00:59:33.780 align:start position:0%
on the next page as a highway fund it
 
00:59:36.470 --> 00:59:36.480 align:start position:0%
closely mirrors uh
 
00:59:37.849 --> 00:59:37.859 align:start position:0%
our number is closely mirror that
 
00:59:40.970 --> 00:59:40.980 align:start position:0%
provided by safety uh for fiscal year 23
 
00:59:43.970 --> 00:59:43.980 align:start position:0%
our revenues are 1.66 percent lower than
 
00:59:46.789 --> 00:59:46.799 align:start position:0%
theirs again this small discrepancy is
 
00:59:49.309 --> 00:59:49.319 align:start position:0%
really a timing issue
 
00:59:52.490 --> 00:59:52.500 align:start position:0%
uh unlike the real estate transfer tax
 
00:59:53.809 --> 00:59:53.819 align:start position:0%
the latest numbers from the highway plan
 
00:59:58.010 --> 00:59:58.020 align:start position:0%
were a positive uh 2.7 percent over plan
 
01:00:01.630 --> 01:00:01.640 align:start position:0%
uh and and that was actually in January
 
01:00:04.430 --> 01:00:04.440 align:start position:0%
so therefore for fiscal year 23 I
 
01:00:07.030 --> 01:00:07.040 align:start position:0%
believe the Department's estimate of
 
01:00:09.410 --> 01:00:09.420 align:start position:0%
257.7 million is actually the correct
 
01:00:12.289 --> 01:00:12.299 align:start position:0%
number so we'll be actually increasing
 
01:00:12.299 --> 01:00:14.150 align:start position:0%
number so we'll be actually increasing
uh

01:00:14.150 --> 01:00:14.160 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:00:16.089 --> 01:00:16.099 align:start position:0%
our number for that
 
01:00:20.089 --> 01:00:20.099 align:start position:0%
uh in fiscal year 24 and 25 our numbers
 
01:00:22.250 --> 01:00:22.260 align:start position:0%
total those provided by safety but
 
01:00:25.609 --> 01:00:25.619 align:start position:0%
because we we based our increase off of
 
01:00:29.870 --> 01:00:29.880 align:start position:0%
23 uh a couple of the numbers uh are a
 
01:00:31.370 --> 01:00:31.380 align:start position:0%
little bit different the gas total and
 
01:00:32.809 --> 01:00:32.819 align:start position:0%
the motor vehicle fees are a little bit
 
01:00:36.710 --> 01:00:36.720 align:start position:0%
different again uh just 0.16 and 0.15
 
01:00:38.690 --> 01:00:38.700 align:start position:0%
off it's it's almost a rounding error
 
01:00:42.410 --> 01:00:42.420 align:start position:0%
but uh you know the the bottom line
 
01:00:47.390 --> 01:00:47.400 align:start position:0%
number of 258.8 million in 24 and 259.3
 
01:00:50.930 --> 01:00:50.940 align:start position:0%
million and 25 are you know are are
 
01:00:50.940 --> 01:00:53.030 align:start position:0%
million and 25 are you know are are
together

01:00:53.030 --> 01:00:53.040 align:start position:0%
together
 
01:00:54.829 --> 01:00:54.839 align:start position:0%
uh and really the same thing for fish
 
01:00:59.750 --> 01:00:59.760 align:start position:0%
and game uh in 23 are estimate of 13.3
 
01:01:01.490 --> 01:01:01.500 align:start position:0%
million for the fish and game fund is
 
01:01:04.609 --> 01:01:04.619 align:start position:0%
slightly under the Department's
 
01:01:07.670 --> 01:01:07.680 align:start position:0%
prediction of 13.76 million but then
 
01:01:10.730 --> 01:01:10.740 align:start position:0%
going forward uh the numbers are fairly
 
01:01:13.250 --> 01:01:13.260 align:start position:0%
consistent and steady uh no major growth
 
01:01:15.430 --> 01:01:15.440 align:start position:0%
or decline we are predicted projecting
 
01:01:20.210 --> 01:01:20.220 align:start position:0%
13.37 million for both 24 and 25 which
 
01:01:21.890 --> 01:01:21.900 align:start position:0%
is the Department of Fish and games
 
01:01:24.829 --> 01:01:24.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:28.849 --> 01:01:28.859 align:start position:0%
representative all me thank you and I
 
01:01:31.549 --> 01:01:31.559 align:start position:0%
was trying to find the place in the
 
01:01:34.670 --> 01:01:34.680 align:start position:0%
governor's executive budget summary uh
 
01:01:36.349 --> 01:01:36.359 align:start position:0%
in order to be able to compare last
 
01:01:40.370 --> 01:01:40.380 align:start position:0%
night and the only thing that I found
 
01:01:42.950 --> 01:01:42.960 align:start position:0%
was page 17.
 
01:01:45.349 --> 01:01:45.359 align:start position:0%
general fund and total funds expenditure
 
01:01:45.359 --> 01:01:47.390 align:start position:0%
general fund and total funds expenditure
summary

01:01:47.390 --> 01:01:47.400 align:start position:0%
summary
 
01:01:47.400 --> 01:01:49.670 align:start position:0%
summary
and

01:01:49.670 --> 01:01:49.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:01:53.390 --> 01:01:53.400 align:start position:0%
oh no sorry 16. the budget summary
 
01:01:56.690 --> 01:01:56.700 align:start position:0%
source of funds on the highway fund
 
01:01:56.700 --> 01:01:58.390 align:start position:0%
source of funds on the highway fund
there

01:01:58.390 --> 01:01:58.400 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:02:01.609 --> 01:02:01.619 align:start position:0%
for 20
 
01:02:04.609 --> 01:02:04.619 align:start position:0%
23 which is what I'm looking at right
 
01:02:10.930 --> 01:02:10.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:15.890 --> 01:02:15.900 align:start position:0%
2 and in oh and adjusted adjusted
 
01:02:21.770 --> 01:02:21.780 align:start position:0%
authorized is 265 but the
 
01:02:21.780 --> 01:02:24.230 align:start position:0%
authorized is 265 but the
25

01:02:24.230 --> 01:02:24.240 align:start position:0%
25
 
01:02:26.150 --> 01:02:26.160 align:start position:0%
these numbers seem to be a little bit
 
01:02:28.609 --> 01:02:28.619 align:start position:0%
different from okay I don't I don't have
 
01:02:30.109 --> 01:02:30.119 align:start position:0%
a copy of that in front of me actually
 
01:02:32.270 --> 01:02:32.280 align:start position:0%
this is the capital budget I wasn't sure
 
01:02:34.130 --> 01:02:34.140 align:start position:0%
if it was equivalent to what we were
 
01:02:37.069 --> 01:02:37.079 align:start position:0%
looking at before which is comparing
 
01:02:40.370 --> 01:02:40.380 align:start position:0%
page 15 the unrestricted Revenue with
 
01:02:44.390 --> 01:02:44.400 align:start position:0%
what we had before okay as as soon as
 
01:02:50.750 --> 01:02:50.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:50.760 --> 01:03:03.650 align:start position:0%
 
absolutely

01:03:03.650 --> 01:03:03.660 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:08.329 --> 01:03:08.339 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:11.569 --> 01:03:11.579 align:start position:0%
okay uh for the revenue figures uh and
 
01:03:13.130 --> 01:03:13.140 align:start position:0%
the governor's executive budget summary
 
01:03:43.549 --> 01:03:43.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:45.410 --> 01:03:45.420 align:start position:0%
yeah it depends on which revenues you
 
01:03:46.910 --> 01:03:46.920 align:start position:0%
you count and not there are a lot of
 
01:03:50.210 --> 01:03:50.220 align:start position:0%
different moving Parts here uh but I I
 
01:03:54.410 --> 01:03:54.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:54.420 --> 01:03:55.809 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:03:55.809 --> 01:03:55.819 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:03:58.910 --> 01:03:58.920 align:start position:0%
yeah I can I can get you
 
01:04:00.410 --> 01:04:00.420 align:start position:0%
um at first I assure you that our
 
01:04:02.510 --> 01:04:02.520 align:start position:0%
numbers are equal to them and what
 
01:04:04.910 --> 01:04:04.920 align:start position:0%
happens is and and
 
01:04:07.190 --> 01:04:07.200 align:start position:0%
um it was just whispered in my ear which
 
01:04:09.289 --> 01:04:09.299 align:start position:0%
is actually correct is the uh the cost
 
01:04:11.809 --> 01:04:11.819 align:start position:0%
of collections is different and so
 
01:04:13.609 --> 01:04:13.619 align:start position:0%
that's why these numbers are a little
 
01:04:15.410 --> 01:04:15.420 align:start position:0%
bit different than the actual Revenue
 
01:04:15.420 --> 01:04:16.910 align:start position:0%
bit different than the actual Revenue
projections

01:04:16.910 --> 01:04:16.920 align:start position:0%
projections
 
01:04:23.089 --> 01:04:23.099 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:23.099 --> 01:04:25.430 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:04:25.430 --> 01:04:25.440 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:04:28.069 --> 01:04:28.079 align:start position:0%
uh and again just finished up with the
 
01:04:30.230 --> 01:04:30.240 align:start position:0%
fish and game fund uh as I mentioned
 
01:04:33.770 --> 01:04:33.780 align:start position:0%
again our numbers are are uh the same
 
01:04:35.690 --> 01:04:35.700 align:start position:0%
for fiscal year 24 and 25 slightly
 
01:04:38.089 --> 01:04:38.099 align:start position:0%
different in fiscal year 23 but again
 
01:04:42.109 --> 01:04:42.119 align:start position:0%
it's it's roughly 400 000 we are less
 
01:04:42.119 --> 01:04:44.150 align:start position:0%
it's it's roughly 400 000 we are less
so

01:04:44.150 --> 01:04:44.160 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:04:46.490 --> 01:04:46.500 align:start position:0%
and with that I'll if there are any
 
01:04:48.410 --> 01:04:48.420 align:start position:0%
remaining questions excellent
 
01:04:50.210 --> 01:04:50.220 align:start position:0%
presentation and and I think we'll be
 
01:04:52.670 --> 01:04:52.680 align:start position:0%
quoting you in your introductory remarks
 
01:04:55.190 --> 01:04:55.200 align:start position:0%
when we get to the floor any other
 
01:04:55.200 --> 01:04:57.010 align:start position:0%
when we get to the floor any other
questions

01:04:57.010 --> 01:04:57.020 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:05:01.430 --> 01:05:01.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:02.990 --> 01:05:03.000 align:start position:0%
thank you very much it was a pleasure
 
01:05:04.309 --> 01:05:04.319 align:start position:0%
and please reach out if you have any
 
01:05:06.230 --> 01:05:06.240 align:start position:0%
additional questions uh over the next
 
01:05:07.730 --> 01:05:07.740 align:start position:0%
few days as you're doing your tough job
 
01:05:09.950 --> 01:05:09.960 align:start position:0%
of deciding what numbers to go with
 
01:05:11.210 --> 01:05:11.220 align:start position:0%
right we have a little bit more
 
01:05:13.069 --> 01:05:13.079 align:start position:0%
information now we've been doing this a
 
01:05:14.690 --> 01:05:14.700 align:start position:0%
few more weeks after you finish so yes
 
01:05:16.849 --> 01:05:16.859 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very much
 
01:05:19.670 --> 01:05:19.680 align:start position:0%

do we have handouts coming our way we do
 
01:05:47.280 --> 01:06:32.210 align:start position:0%
do we have handouts coming our way we do
wonderful

01:06:32.210 --> 01:06:32.220 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:32.220 --> 01:06:35.630 align:start position:0%
 
understanding

01:06:35.630 --> 01:06:35.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:37.010 --> 01:06:37.020 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:06:39.230 --> 01:06:39.240 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:06:39.240 --> 01:07:21.349 align:start position:0%
thank you
thank you

01:07:21.349 --> 01:07:21.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:23.870 --> 01:07:23.880 align:start position:0%
okay welcome back
 
01:07:25.490 --> 01:07:25.500 align:start position:0%
thank you for working during vacation
 
01:07:28.250 --> 01:07:28.260 align:start position:0%
week of course uh just gets away from my
 
01:07:30.470 --> 01:07:30.480 align:start position:0%
kids thank you uh Madam chair members of
 
01:07:32.029 --> 01:07:32.039 align:start position:0%
the committee uh my name is Charlie
 
01:07:33.829 --> 01:07:33.839 align:start position:0%
McIntyre privilege of being director of
 
01:07:35.569 --> 01:07:35.579 align:start position:0%
Hampshire lottery
 
01:07:35.579 --> 01:07:36.470 align:start position:0%
Hampshire lottery
um

01:07:36.470 --> 01:07:36.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:07:39.829 --> 01:07:39.839 align:start position:0%
I uh put together we sort of generated
 
01:07:43.549 --> 01:07:43.559 align:start position:0%
some breakdowns of how our revenues are
 
01:07:43.559 --> 01:07:44.770 align:start position:0%
some breakdowns of how our revenues are
generated

01:07:44.770 --> 01:07:44.780 align:start position:0%
generated
 
01:07:47.270 --> 01:07:47.280 align:start position:0%
by product line
 
01:07:49.430 --> 01:07:49.440 align:start position:0%
and I'll go through them very quickly
 
01:07:52.670 --> 01:07:52.680 align:start position:0%
obviously I don't want to re recite what
 
01:07:54.770 --> 01:07:54.780 align:start position:0%
you can read easily um but certainly
 
01:07:56.390 --> 01:07:56.400 align:start position:0%
I'll go by product type
 
01:07:59.029 --> 01:07:59.039 align:start position:0%
uh insta tickets obviously or scratch
 
01:08:00.650 --> 01:08:00.660 align:start position:0%
tickets which you probably are familiar
 
01:08:00.660 --> 01:08:02.270 align:start position:0%
tickets which you probably are familiar
with

01:08:02.270 --> 01:08:02.280 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:08:04.069 --> 01:08:04.079 align:start position:0%
um the margin on these products varies
 
01:08:06.349 --> 01:08:06.359 align:start position:0%
wildly by Price Point as you can imagine
 
01:08:08.630 --> 01:08:08.640 align:start position:0%
a dollar ticket has lower price
 
01:08:11.210 --> 01:08:11.220 align:start position:0%
structure than a 25 ticket does
 
01:08:13.430 --> 01:08:13.440 align:start position:0%
so the Blended
 
01:08:16.550 --> 01:08:16.560 align:start position:0%
margin is about 18 on those give or take
 
01:08:19.550 --> 01:08:19.560 align:start position:0%
and last year our sales were 313 million
 
01:08:21.769 --> 01:08:21.779 align:start position:0%
dollars on that product line
 
01:08:24.769 --> 01:08:24.779 align:start position:0%
multi-state jackpot games uh most
 
01:08:26.329 --> 01:08:26.339 align:start position:0%
well-known are Powerball and Mega
 
01:08:27.590 --> 01:08:27.600 align:start position:0%
Millions they're sold throughout the
 
01:08:27.600 --> 01:08:29.209 align:start position:0%
Millions they're sold throughout the
nation

01:08:29.209 --> 01:08:29.219 align:start position:0%
nation
 
01:08:31.490 --> 01:08:31.500 align:start position:0%
um the margin is incredibly high on
 
01:08:33.829 --> 01:08:33.839 align:start position:0%
those at 39 percent approximately
 
01:08:37.430 --> 01:08:37.440 align:start position:0%
last year we did 59 million this year
 
01:08:39.530 --> 01:08:39.540 align:start position:0%
we've already exceeded that number
 
01:08:41.689 --> 01:08:41.699 align:start position:0%
to date and we still have obviously a
 
01:08:43.070 --> 01:08:43.080 align:start position:0%
number of months to go
 
01:08:45.950 --> 01:08:45.960 align:start position:0%
this year's revenue on Powerball Mega
 
01:08:48.470 --> 01:08:48.480 align:start position:0%
Millions is anomalously high
 
01:08:50.390 --> 01:08:50.400 align:start position:0%
because of interest rates
 
01:08:52.249 --> 01:08:52.259 align:start position:0%
so what happens with Powerball and Mega
 
01:08:54.590 --> 01:08:54.600 align:start position:0%
Millions is we sell a ticket and then
 
01:08:58.490 --> 01:08:58.500 align:start position:0%
say it's a dollar of that dollar 33
 
01:09:01.010 --> 01:09:01.020 align:start position:0%
sense of it essentially goes into a
 
01:09:04.010 --> 01:09:04.020 align:start position:0%
jackpot fund that jackpot fund is then
 
01:09:06.829 --> 01:09:06.839 align:start position:0%
multiplied by a bond Factor that gets us
 
01:09:08.090 --> 01:09:08.100 align:start position:0%
our jackpot
 
01:09:10.610 --> 01:09:10.620 align:start position:0%
so three years ago the bond Factor was
 
01:09:13.669 --> 01:09:13.679 align:start position:0%
approximately 1.4 the bond Factor now is
 
01:09:16.610 --> 01:09:16.620 align:start position:0%
approximately 2.4 so you that's one of
 
01:09:19.010 --> 01:09:19.020 align:start position:0%
the reasons you've seen several several
 
01:09:20.930 --> 01:09:20.940 align:start position:0%
I think it's three billion dollar
 
01:09:23.150 --> 01:09:23.160 align:start position:0%
jackpots and one two billion dollar
 
01:09:26.329 --> 01:09:26.339 align:start position:0%
jackpot is because interest rates have
 
01:09:27.890 --> 01:09:27.900 align:start position:0%
increased the
 
01:09:30.769 --> 01:09:30.779 align:start position:0%
jackpot size and increase the marketing
 
01:09:32.450 --> 01:09:32.460 align:start position:0%
opportunities and
 
01:09:34.970 --> 01:09:34.980 align:start position:0%
that certainly we anticipate to not be
 
01:09:37.370 --> 01:09:37.380 align:start position:0%
the norm going forward
 
01:09:40.430 --> 01:09:40.440 align:start position:0%
moreover there's a function in our
 
01:09:42.829 --> 01:09:42.839 align:start position:0%
business called jackpot fatigue
 
01:09:45.289 --> 01:09:45.299 align:start position:0%
you know a billion dollars isn't what it
 
01:09:49.430 --> 01:09:49.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:51.890 --> 01:09:51.900 align:start position:0%
um as the job when you see it over and
 
01:09:53.570 --> 01:09:53.580 align:start position:0%
over again it loses the interest the
 
01:09:55.970 --> 01:09:55.980 align:start position:0%
news isn't is interested media is not as
 
01:09:57.709 --> 01:09:57.719 align:start position:0%
interested so
 
01:10:00.950 --> 01:10:00.960 align:start position:0%
it it declines it just does
 
01:10:03.050 --> 01:10:03.060 align:start position:0%
the next grouping is called Tri-State
 
01:10:05.330 --> 01:10:05.340 align:start position:0%
games these are a number of tickets that
 
01:10:07.310 --> 01:10:07.320 align:start position:0%
we sell collectively with Vermont and
 
01:10:09.709 --> 01:10:09.719 align:start position:0%
Maine based on a compact dating back to
 
01:10:13.669 --> 01:10:13.679 align:start position:0%
1986 signed by then governor sununu
 
01:10:13.679 --> 01:10:15.410 align:start position:0%
1986 signed by then governor sununu
um

01:10:15.410 --> 01:10:15.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:10:18.470 --> 01:10:18.480 align:start position:0%
the tickets vary by product line the
 
01:10:18.480 --> 01:10:19.370 align:start position:0%
the tickets vary by product line the
overall

01:10:19.370 --> 01:10:19.380 align:start position:0%
overall
 
01:10:23.510 --> 01:10:23.520 align:start position:0%
margin is approximately 20 and last year
 
01:10:25.790 --> 01:10:25.800 align:start position:0%
we sold about 39 million dollars of that
 
01:10:29.090 --> 01:10:29.100 align:start position:0%
those games tend to be pretty stable
 
01:10:31.490 --> 01:10:31.500 align:start position:0%
um and therefore it make estimating easy
 
01:10:34.390 --> 01:10:34.400 align:start position:0%
for Powerball Mega Millions are
 
01:10:37.250 --> 01:10:37.260 align:start position:0%
fluctuate wildly I mean by tens of
 
01:10:39.350 --> 01:10:39.360 align:start position:0%
millions of dollars annually so it makes
 
01:10:42.649 --> 01:10:42.659 align:start position:0%
estimating very hard candidly
 
01:10:44.990 --> 01:10:45.000 align:start position:0%
um the next product is called Lucky for
 
01:10:47.990 --> 01:10:48.000 align:start position:0%
Life it's a ticket that we started
 
01:10:50.330 --> 01:10:50.340 align:start position:0%
with the New England states and now it's
 
01:10:52.370 --> 01:10:52.380 align:start position:0%
about 22 States across the country do it
 
01:10:54.350 --> 01:10:54.360 align:start position:0%
toward 25.
 
01:10:57.470 --> 01:10:57.480 align:start position:0%
um it has a set jackpot prize you win a
 
01:10:58.550 --> 01:10:58.560 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars a day for Life
 
01:11:00.890 --> 01:11:00.900 align:start position:0%
obviously it's a very good price
 
01:11:02.750 --> 01:11:02.760 align:start position:0%
um we do about eight million dollars
 
01:11:04.910 --> 01:11:04.920 align:start position:0%
last year in that and that's stable as
 
01:11:04.920 --> 01:11:06.350 align:start position:0%
last year in that and that's stable as
well

01:11:06.350 --> 01:11:06.360 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:11:08.689 --> 01:11:08.699 align:start position:0%
Keno is a game that this body approved
 
01:11:10.790 --> 01:11:10.800 align:start position:0%
in 2017
 
01:11:13.250 --> 01:11:13.260 align:start position:0%
uh it was initially limited to bars and
 
01:11:16.010 --> 01:11:16.020 align:start position:0%
taverns it is now authorized within
 
01:11:18.470 --> 01:11:18.480 align:start position:0%
convenience stores in cities and towns
 
01:11:20.390 --> 01:11:20.400 align:start position:0%
that have approved Keno
 
01:11:22.070 --> 01:11:22.080 align:start position:0%
um our margin on that is about 19
 
01:11:22.080 --> 01:11:23.270 align:start position:0%
um our margin on that is about 19
percent

01:11:23.270 --> 01:11:23.280 align:start position:0%
percent
 
01:11:26.450 --> 01:11:26.460 align:start position:0%
sales with 53 million dollars last year
 
01:11:28.130 --> 01:11:28.140 align:start position:0%
um so it's not quite 10 million
 
01:11:28.140 --> 01:11:30.169 align:start position:0%
um so it's not quite 10 million
profitability

01:11:30.169 --> 01:11:30.179 align:start position:0%
profitability
 
01:11:33.110 --> 01:11:33.120 align:start position:0%
the next category is called ilottery
 
01:11:35.330 --> 01:11:35.340 align:start position:0%
which is you can use your phone or your
 
01:11:37.189 --> 01:11:37.199 align:start position:0%
computer to buy lottery tickets
 
01:11:40.130 --> 01:11:40.140 align:start position:0%
uh Powerball Mega Millions as well as
 
01:11:42.709 --> 01:11:42.719 align:start position:0%
what we call e-instance which are
 
01:11:45.110 --> 01:11:45.120 align:start position:0%
scratch tickets through your phone
 
01:11:47.630 --> 01:11:47.640 align:start position:0%
um we don't recognize
 
01:11:49.790 --> 01:11:49.800 align:start position:0%
gross revenues in that context we only
 
01:11:52.669 --> 01:11:52.679 align:start position:0%
recognize what we call Gross Gaming
 
01:11:54.350 --> 01:11:54.360 align:start position:0%
revenue which is money after prizes
 
01:11:57.410 --> 01:11:57.420 align:start position:0%
because what happens is you can use you
 
01:11:59.570 --> 01:11:59.580 align:start position:0%
can play for very low dollar amounts you
 
01:12:01.729 --> 01:12:01.739 align:start position:0%
can play a instant scratch ticket for
 
01:12:04.430 --> 01:12:04.440 align:start position:0%
three cents and if you win you know if
 
01:12:07.189 --> 01:12:07.199 align:start position:0%
better nickel win a nickel there's a
 
01:12:09.590 --> 01:12:09.600 align:start position:0%
constant flow so we only recognize it as
 
01:12:11.030 --> 01:12:11.040 align:start position:0%
sort of money that's left at the end of
 
01:12:12.410 --> 01:12:12.420 align:start position:0%
the day
 
01:12:12.420 --> 01:12:13.070 align:start position:0%
the day
um

01:12:13.070 --> 01:12:13.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:12:15.410 --> 01:12:15.420 align:start position:0%
for revenue and that would be just about
 
01:12:17.270 --> 01:12:17.280 align:start position:0%
30 million dollars last year
 
01:12:19.310 --> 01:12:19.320 align:start position:0%
and then obviously a very topical
 
01:12:22.070 --> 01:12:22.080 align:start position:0%
product is sports betting
 
01:12:22.080 --> 01:12:23.090 align:start position:0%
product is sports betting
um

01:12:23.090 --> 01:12:23.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:12:26.510 --> 01:12:26.520 align:start position:0%
which we launched in December 30th 2019
 
01:12:28.850 --> 01:12:28.860 align:start position:0%
once again sales are recognized in Gross
 
01:12:31.610 --> 01:12:31.620 align:start position:0%
Gaming revenue we don't recognize the we
 
01:12:33.290 --> 01:12:33.300 align:start position:0%
recognize it but we don't really
 
01:12:36.350 --> 01:12:36.360 align:start position:0%
consider the amount bet because it's
 
01:12:38.630 --> 01:12:38.640 align:start position:0%
such a large number it's more akin to
 
01:12:41.209 --> 01:12:41.219 align:start position:0%
like stock trading because you know I
 
01:12:43.790 --> 01:12:43.800 align:start position:0%
bet you bet 100 that 100 goes back and
 
01:12:46.130 --> 01:12:46.140 align:start position:0%
forth a bunch of times so it's uh
 
01:12:47.990 --> 01:12:48.000 align:start position:0%
Revenue last year was approximately 23
 
01:12:51.050 --> 01:12:51.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:54.470 --> 01:12:54.480 align:start position:0%
on the next page is a pie chart
 
01:12:57.709 --> 01:12:57.719 align:start position:0%
which is a breakdown of our expenses
 
01:12:59.209 --> 01:12:59.219 align:start position:0%
and as you can see this is for
 
01:13:00.470 --> 01:13:00.480 align:start position:0%
traditional Lottery
 
01:13:03.890 --> 01:13:03.900 align:start position:0%
the largest expense we have is prizes UH
 
01:13:06.709 --> 01:13:06.719 align:start position:0%
60 cents of the dollar essentially goes
 
01:13:09.530 --> 01:13:09.540 align:start position:0%
back to prizes the second largest is the
 
01:13:11.630 --> 01:13:11.640 align:start position:0%
distribution of the education trust fund
 
01:13:12.729 --> 01:13:12.739 align:start position:0%
which is set
 
01:13:15.169 --> 01:13:15.179 align:start position:0%
27.3 percent
 
01:13:17.090 --> 01:13:17.100 align:start position:0%
the next largest is the retailer
 
01:13:20.290 --> 01:13:20.300 align:start position:0%
commission at 5.7
 
01:13:24.470 --> 01:13:24.480 align:start position:0%
vendor fees of 3.6 percent
 
01:13:27.590 --> 01:13:27.600 align:start position:0%
administrative costs of 1.6 percent
 
01:13:30.709 --> 01:13:30.719 align:start position:0%
Instant tickets and delivery is 1.3
 
01:13:34.490 --> 01:13:34.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:36.229 --> 01:13:36.239 align:start position:0%
so as you could you know we're obviously
 
01:13:37.490 --> 01:13:37.500 align:start position:0%
proud of the fact that we're remarkably
 
01:13:37.500 --> 01:13:43.490 align:start position:0%
proud of the fact that we're remarkably
lean

01:13:43.490 --> 01:13:43.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:46.010 --> 01:13:46.020 align:start position:0%
uh on the next page Begins the breakdown
 
01:13:47.689 --> 01:13:47.699 align:start position:0%
of charitable gambling
 
01:13:50.090 --> 01:13:50.100 align:start position:0%
in this in the New Hampshire
 
01:13:53.090 --> 01:13:53.100 align:start position:0%
we regulate uh four different types of
 
01:13:54.590 --> 01:13:54.600 align:start position:0%
charitable gambling
 
01:13:58.370 --> 01:13:58.380 align:start position:0%
Bingo Lucky Seven games of chance and
 
01:14:00.709 --> 01:14:00.719 align:start position:0%
historic horse racing there is a fifth
 
01:14:02.930 --> 01:14:02.940 align:start position:0%
category of charitable gambling in the
 
01:14:05.810 --> 01:14:05.820 align:start position:0%
broadest sense that would be raffles we
 
01:14:07.610 --> 01:14:07.620 align:start position:0%
have no role in Raffles we often get
 
01:14:09.830 --> 01:14:09.840 align:start position:0%
that question but Raffles are governed
 
01:14:12.709 --> 01:14:12.719 align:start position:0%
by uh jurisdictional law enforcement so
 
01:14:14.510 --> 01:14:14.520 align:start position:0%
police departments for cities and towns
 
01:14:20.630 --> 01:14:20.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:22.610 --> 01:14:22.620 align:start position:0%
um and I don't know how much you want to
 
01:14:24.350 --> 01:14:24.360 align:start position:0%
go through this there's a very distinct
 
01:14:26.689 --> 01:14:26.699 align:start position:0%
breakdown of all the various charitable
 
01:14:29.149 --> 01:14:29.159 align:start position:0%
gambling and the
 
01:14:31.490 --> 01:14:31.500 align:start position:0%
Revenue received by the state as well as
 
01:14:33.830 --> 01:14:33.840 align:start position:0%
the charities in the next two pages
 
01:14:33.840 --> 01:14:34.550 align:start position:0%
the charities in the next two pages
um

01:14:34.550 --> 01:14:34.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:14:37.970 --> 01:14:37.980 align:start position:0%
and then the last page is a breakdown
 
01:14:41.390 --> 01:14:41.400 align:start position:0%
also a pie chart for games of chance in
 
01:14:43.250 --> 01:14:43.260 align:start position:0%
historic horse racing for calendar year
 
01:14:43.260 --> 01:14:50.149 align:start position:0%
historic horse racing for calendar year
22.

01:14:50.149 --> 01:14:50.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:51.950 --> 01:14:51.960 align:start position:0%
you have a further handout a single page
 
01:14:55.310 --> 01:14:55.320 align:start position:0%
which is the revenue streams involved
 
01:14:57.890 --> 01:14:57.900 align:start position:0%
uh and our projected
 
01:15:00.590 --> 01:15:00.600 align:start position:0%
basis for our Revenue estimates I think
 
01:15:02.330 --> 01:15:02.340 align:start position:0%
we provide those Revenue estimates to
 
01:15:02.340 --> 01:15:03.110 align:start position:0%
we provide those Revenue estimates to
you

01:15:03.110 --> 01:15:03.120 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:15:05.209 --> 01:15:05.219 align:start position:0%
a number of days ago
 
01:15:07.430 --> 01:15:07.440 align:start position:0%
um but here is a breakdown of how we
 
01:15:09.649 --> 01:15:09.659 align:start position:0%
arrive at those Revenue estimates
 
01:15:13.189 --> 01:15:13.199 align:start position:0%
both on the lottery Division and well it
 
01:15:14.630 --> 01:15:14.640 align:start position:0%
says investigative and compliance
 
01:15:15.830 --> 01:15:15.840 align:start position:0%
division that's charitable gambling
 
01:15:17.570 --> 01:15:17.580 align:start position:0%
charitable gambling is governed by that
 
01:15:20.270 --> 01:15:20.280 align:start position:0%
division within our agency
 
01:15:20.280 --> 01:15:21.350 align:start position:0%
division within our agency
um

01:15:21.350 --> 01:15:21.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:15:25.610 --> 01:15:25.620 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:26.830 --> 01:15:26.840 align:start position:0%
so sorry
 
01:15:29.149 --> 01:15:29.159 align:start position:0%
single Peak yep
 
01:15:31.729 --> 01:15:31.739 align:start position:0%
um is a breakdown of those most notably
 
01:15:33.430 --> 01:15:33.440 align:start position:0%
I'll sort of get ahead of the questions
 
01:15:36.530 --> 01:15:36.540 align:start position:0%
on draw based games we anticipate a drop
 
01:15:36.540 --> 01:15:37.310 align:start position:0%
on draw based games we anticipate a drop
off

01:15:37.310 --> 01:15:37.320 align:start position:0%
off
 
01:15:39.649 --> 01:15:39.659 align:start position:0%
significantly significantly based on the
 
01:15:41.270 --> 01:15:41.280 align:start position:0%
Powerball Mega Millions situation which
 
01:15:42.649 --> 01:15:42.659 align:start position:0%
I explained
 
01:15:44.450 --> 01:15:44.460 align:start position:0%
further sports betting we would
 
01:15:45.970 --> 01:15:45.980 align:start position:0%
anticipate a
 
01:15:48.709 --> 01:15:48.719 align:start position:0%
an effect of Massachusetts
 
01:15:51.410 --> 01:15:51.420 align:start position:0%
launching sports betting and
 
01:15:53.750 --> 01:15:53.760 align:start position:0%
that we derive a significant portion of
 
01:15:56.450 --> 01:15:56.460 align:start position:0%
our player base from Massachusetts and
 
01:15:58.189 --> 01:15:58.199 align:start position:0%
those are really the two areas we
 
01:16:00.649 --> 01:16:00.659 align:start position:0%
anticipate an effect
 
01:16:03.290 --> 01:16:03.300 align:start position:0%
I would note that a revenue estimated
 
01:16:07.189 --> 01:16:07.199 align:start position:0%
170 million 0.8 for FY 23
 
01:16:10.189 --> 01:16:10.199 align:start position:0%
is almost double what we had transferred
 
01:16:13.310 --> 01:16:13.320 align:start position:0%
at FY 18. so we've undergrown tremendous
 
01:16:16.189 --> 01:16:16.199 align:start position:0%
growth and so mixed Revenue estimates
 
01:16:18.770 --> 01:16:18.780 align:start position:0%
kind of tricky
 
01:16:20.149 --> 01:16:20.159 align:start position:0%
and with that I'll answer any questions
 
01:16:22.669 --> 01:16:22.679 align:start position:0%
you may have
 
01:16:24.410 --> 01:16:24.420 align:start position:0%
about anything
 
01:16:27.410 --> 01:16:27.420 align:start position:0%
representative elberger has a question
 
01:16:30.229 --> 01:16:30.239 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair I'm just uh
 
01:16:32.930 --> 01:16:32.940 align:start position:0%
looking at the single sheet
 
01:16:34.790 --> 01:16:34.800 align:start position:0%
the games of chance and there's a
 
01:16:37.370 --> 01:16:37.380 align:start position:0%
significant drop in this year and I
 
01:16:40.010 --> 01:16:40.020 align:start position:0%
assume that's based on the that just
 
01:16:42.050 --> 01:16:42.060 align:start position:0%
what you were talking about it is and
 
01:16:44.870 --> 01:16:44.880 align:start position:0%
also the the conversion to Historic
 
01:16:46.250 --> 01:16:46.260 align:start position:0%
horse racing some of the rooms had
 
01:16:46.260 --> 01:16:48.169 align:start position:0%
horse racing some of the rooms had
closed

01:16:48.169 --> 01:16:48.179 align:start position:0%
closed
 
01:16:50.810 --> 01:16:50.820 align:start position:0%
um and at weren't open for a period of
 
01:16:52.430 --> 01:16:52.440 align:start position:0%
time so there was a drop-off thank you
 
01:17:02.709 --> 01:17:02.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:05.570 --> 01:17:05.580 align:start position:0%
representative yes thank you madam chair
 
01:17:07.310 --> 01:17:07.320 align:start position:0%
I'm just looking at this sheet as well
 
01:17:09.530 --> 01:17:09.540 align:start position:0%
on the sports betting
 
01:17:11.810 --> 01:17:11.820 align:start position:0%
the projections look well they're looked
 
01:17:14.270 --> 01:17:14.280 align:start position:0%
down on 224 which you I think you
 
01:17:16.610 --> 01:17:16.620 align:start position:0%
addressed that but largely flat
 
01:17:16.620 --> 01:17:18.350 align:start position:0%
addressed that but largely flat
and

01:17:18.350 --> 01:17:18.360 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:17:21.110 --> 01:17:21.120 align:start position:0%
you know I think I I guess I want a
 
01:17:22.490 --> 01:17:22.500 align:start position:0%
little more information on that it
 
01:17:24.830 --> 01:17:24.840 align:start position:0%
appears to me as a consumer that this
 
01:17:27.050 --> 01:17:27.060 align:start position:0%
sports betting is blowing up I mean
 
01:17:29.990 --> 01:17:30.000 align:start position:0%
DraftKings bar stool I mean it seems
 
01:17:31.669 --> 01:17:31.679 align:start position:0%
like it's getting pop more popular all
 
01:17:33.530 --> 01:17:33.540 align:start position:0%
around the country
 
01:17:36.290 --> 01:17:36.300 align:start position:0%
um so wonder why we're projecting a kind
 
01:17:39.649 --> 01:17:39.659 align:start position:0%
of a flat trajectory so um
 
01:17:42.050 --> 01:17:42.060 align:start position:0%
I the flight trajectory is taking into
 
01:17:43.850 --> 01:17:43.860 align:start position:0%
account both the growth as well as the
 
01:17:45.709 --> 01:17:45.719 align:start position:0%
negative impact of Massachusetts
 
01:17:48.770 --> 01:17:48.780 align:start position:0%
so while we if Mass didn't exist we
 
01:17:50.450 --> 01:17:50.460 align:start position:0%
would be I don't say hockey stick growth
 
01:17:52.310 --> 01:17:52.320 align:start position:0%
because we're number two in the nation
 
01:17:53.689 --> 01:17:53.699 align:start position:0%
per capita for sports betting revenue
 
01:17:55.790 --> 01:17:55.800 align:start position:0%
for the state out of the 30 somewhat
 
01:17:58.310 --> 01:17:58.320 align:start position:0%
States we're number two so
 
01:18:01.010 --> 01:18:01.020 align:start position:0%
um you know that's pretty good
 
01:18:03.770 --> 01:18:03.780 align:start position:0%
um and so it's taking representative
 
01:18:04.850 --> 01:18:04.860 align:start position:0%
your question that's taking into account
 
01:18:06.830 --> 01:18:06.840 align:start position:0%
both continued growth as well as a
 
01:18:08.450 --> 01:18:08.460 align:start position:0%
negative impact for Mass
 
01:18:10.970 --> 01:18:10.980 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:18:13.310 --> 01:18:13.320 align:start position:0%
and Kennedy we tend to be try to be on
 
01:18:14.930 --> 01:18:14.940 align:start position:0%
the conservative side of real estate to
 
01:18:16.729 --> 01:18:16.739 align:start position:0%
our numbers because we understand that
 
01:18:18.649 --> 01:18:18.659 align:start position:0%
you folks spend it before we can make it
 
01:18:18.659 --> 01:18:21.669 align:start position:0%
you folks spend it before we can make it
so

01:18:21.669 --> 01:18:21.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:24.530 --> 01:18:24.540 align:start position:0%
I'm just this is this is not the
 
01:18:26.590 --> 01:18:26.600 align:start position:0%
spending committee
 
01:18:29.209 --> 01:18:29.219 align:start position:0%
representative or says a question
 
01:18:31.010 --> 01:18:31.020 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thanks for taking
 
01:18:32.930 --> 01:18:32.940 align:start position:0%
my question you may have already said
 
01:18:36.350 --> 01:18:36.360 align:start position:0%
but on the single sheet under racing in
 
01:18:38.209 --> 01:18:38.219 align:start position:0%
historic horse racing that's quite a
 
01:18:41.570 --> 01:18:41.580 align:start position:0%
climb so did I miss something or did I
 
01:18:43.610 --> 01:18:43.620 align:start position:0%
no you folks that approved historic
 
01:18:45.350 --> 01:18:45.360 align:start position:0%
horse racing during the last legislative
 
01:18:47.030 --> 01:18:47.040 align:start position:0%
session it's taking them a while to get
 
01:18:48.950 --> 01:18:48.960 align:start position:0%
up and running online and that's what we
 
01:18:50.630 --> 01:18:50.640 align:start position:0%
anticipate the growth to look like it'll
 
01:18:52.970 --> 01:18:52.980 align:start position:0%
be it's almost new Revenue like I
 
01:18:54.950 --> 01:18:54.960 align:start position:0%
hesitate to even put an FY
 
01:18:56.570 --> 01:18:56.580 align:start position:0%
um 22 numbers because they almost didn't
 
01:18:58.669 --> 01:18:58.679 align:start position:0%
exist and so
 
01:19:00.169 --> 01:19:00.179 align:start position:0%
um they're taking a while to get going
 
01:19:03.530 --> 01:19:03.540 align:start position:0%
so that's why thank you very much
 
01:19:09.709 --> 01:19:09.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:14.149 --> 01:19:14.159 align:start position:0%
the last uh page before the the numbers
 
01:19:18.169 --> 01:19:18.179 align:start position:0%
page on are those are the is the
 
01:19:20.330 --> 01:19:20.340 align:start position:0%
historic horse racing
 
01:19:25.189 --> 01:19:25.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:30.770 --> 01:19:30.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:32.510 --> 01:19:32.520 align:start position:0%
but it's going to look very different
 
01:19:35.510 --> 01:19:35.520 align:start position:0%
for this year yes very much so much has
 
01:19:38.270 --> 01:19:38.280 align:start position:0%
come in so far
 
01:19:41.090 --> 01:19:41.100 align:start position:0%
um because they were all
 
01:19:43.490 --> 01:19:43.500 align:start position:0%
building and things like that too and
 
01:19:45.290 --> 01:19:45.300 align:start position:0%
they still are I get to the the updated
 
01:19:48.169 --> 01:19:48.179 align:start position:0%
number still there's going to be a
 
01:19:50.990 --> 01:19:51.000 align:start position:0%
casino just down the road from me and
 
01:19:54.169 --> 01:19:54.179 align:start position:0%
they're calling it slots okay I don't
 
01:19:54.179 --> 01:19:56.270 align:start position:0%
they're calling it slots okay I don't
but

01:19:56.270 --> 01:19:56.280 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:20:00.410 --> 01:20:00.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:02.330 --> 01:20:02.340 align:start position:0%
and we still have a Prohibition against
 
01:20:02.340 --> 01:20:04.970 align:start position:0%
and we still have a Prohibition against
slots

01:20:04.970 --> 01:20:04.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:08.350 --> 01:20:08.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:10.370 --> 01:20:10.380 align:start position:0%
representative Malloy
 
01:20:13.310 --> 01:20:13.320 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair for taking my
 
01:20:15.950 --> 01:20:15.960 align:start position:0%
question uh
 
01:20:15.960 --> 01:20:17.990 align:start position:0%
question uh
the

01:20:17.990 --> 01:20:18.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:20:22.310 --> 01:20:22.320 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at the last page of your
 
01:20:24.770 --> 01:20:24.780 align:start position:0%
your work the pie charts
 
01:20:27.169 --> 01:20:27.179 align:start position:0%
a historic horse racing
 
01:20:27.179 --> 01:20:29.270 align:start position:0%
a historic horse racing
and

01:20:29.270 --> 01:20:29.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:20:29.280 --> 01:20:30.669 align:start position:0%
and
how

01:20:30.669 --> 01:20:30.679 align:start position:0%
how
 
01:20:35.030 --> 01:20:35.040 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm not making a connection between
 
01:20:37.250 --> 01:20:37.260 align:start position:0%
your sheet your one sheet that says
 
01:20:39.310 --> 01:20:39.320 align:start position:0%
historic horse racing and those numbers
 
01:20:42.950 --> 01:20:42.960 align:start position:0%
and this number on historic horse racing
 
01:20:42.960 --> 01:20:44.030 align:start position:0%
and this number on historic horse racing
of

01:20:44.030 --> 01:20:44.040 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:20:45.890 --> 01:20:45.900 align:start position:0%
a lot of money
 
01:20:45.900 --> 01:20:48.050 align:start position:0%
a lot of money
uh

01:20:48.050 --> 01:20:48.060 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:20:50.030 --> 01:20:50.040 align:start position:0%
is there is there a connection here or
 
01:20:51.709 --> 01:20:51.719 align:start position:0%
not or there is good if I could explain
 
01:20:53.750 --> 01:20:53.760 align:start position:0%
uh apologize there's a bit of confusion
 
01:20:55.130 --> 01:20:55.140 align:start position:0%
and it's our fault
 
01:20:56.330 --> 01:20:56.340 align:start position:0%
um the number on the single sheet are
 
01:20:59.030 --> 01:20:59.040 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 22 so they end as of June
 
01:21:01.790 --> 01:21:01.800 align:start position:0%
30th of 22. the numbers in the pie chart
 
01:21:03.110 --> 01:21:03.120 align:start position:0%
are more updated so they're calendar
 
01:21:05.810 --> 01:21:05.820 align:start position:0%
year 22 and a number of the facilities
 
01:21:09.530 --> 01:21:09.540 align:start position:0%
opened uh in the latter half of count
 
01:21:11.510 --> 01:21:11.520 align:start position:0%
year 22 which would be reflected in
 
01:21:16.610 --> 01:21:16.620 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:17.990 --> 01:21:18.000 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:19.370 align:start position:0%
follow up
so

01:21:19.370 --> 01:21:19.380 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:21:23.030 --> 01:21:23.040 align:start position:0%
even in 23
 
01:21:26.090 --> 01:21:26.100 align:start position:0%
historic horse racing you show
 
01:21:26.100 --> 01:21:27.830 align:start position:0%
historic horse racing you show
seven

01:21:27.830 --> 01:21:27.840 align:start position:0%
seven
 
01:21:31.270 --> 01:21:31.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:33.709 --> 01:21:33.719 align:start position:0%
so is that the
 
01:21:35.750 --> 01:21:35.760 align:start position:0%
is that the Rev well I guess what I'm
 
01:21:37.669 --> 01:21:37.679 align:start position:0%
asking is that that's is that this what
 
01:21:39.169 --> 01:21:39.179 align:start position:0%
you're looking at is the state and
 
01:21:41.030 --> 01:21:41.040 align:start position:0%
charity Revenue in that is that is that
 
01:21:42.169 --> 01:21:42.179 align:start position:0%
the number that's reflected no that's
 
01:21:44.149 --> 01:21:44.159 align:start position:0%
the state revenue charity revenue is
 
01:21:47.030 --> 01:21:47.040 align:start position:0%
separate yeah state
 
01:21:49.550 --> 01:21:49.560 align:start position:0%
I I may need to take this offline I'm
 
01:21:51.530 --> 01:21:51.540 align:start position:0%
not report that following you know these
 
01:22:11.810 --> 01:22:11.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:15.709 --> 01:22:15.719 align:start position:0%
okay sorry um Mr Shea suggested I break
 
01:22:18.290 --> 01:22:18.300 align:start position:0%
down so the one sheet which is a revenue
 
01:22:21.770 --> 01:22:21.780 align:start position:0%
streams is a gross number
 
01:22:23.270 --> 01:22:23.280 align:start position:0%
just wanted to make sure that was clear
 
01:22:25.010 --> 01:22:25.020 align:start position:0%
that you didn't spend this
 
01:22:26.270 --> 01:22:26.280 align:start position:0%
um and
 
01:22:28.010 --> 01:22:28.020 align:start position:0%
um our Revenue estimates we had
 
01:22:30.470 --> 01:22:30.480 align:start position:0%
submitted before our
 
01:22:36.530 --> 01:22:36.540 align:start position:0%
um 170 for FY 23 158 for FY 24 and 163
 
01:22:45.169 --> 01:22:45.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:47.209 --> 01:22:47.219 align:start position:0%
representative Ames
 
01:22:50.810 --> 01:22:50.820 align:start position:0%
so on the on that on the
 
01:22:53.570 --> 01:22:53.580 align:start position:0%
estimates of Revenue that go into the
 
01:22:55.729 --> 01:22:55.739 align:start position:0%
general or education fund because they
 
01:22:58.010 --> 01:22:58.020 align:start position:0%
go into the education trust fund
 
01:22:58.020 --> 01:22:59.750 align:start position:0%
go into the education trust fund
um

01:22:59.750 --> 01:22:59.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:23:02.149 --> 01:23:02.159 align:start position:0%
my question is uh
 
01:23:04.189 --> 01:23:04.199 align:start position:0%
regarding level of confidence in these
 
01:23:04.199 --> 01:23:05.149 align:start position:0%
regarding level of confidence in these
numbers

01:23:05.149 --> 01:23:05.159 align:start position:0%
numbers
 
01:23:08.570 --> 01:23:08.580 align:start position:0%
um or if you did a dra's way
 
01:23:11.689 --> 01:23:11.699 align:start position:0%
which is a range they give us a range a
 
01:23:13.970 --> 01:23:13.980 align:start position:0%
high and a low
 
01:23:18.050 --> 01:23:18.060 align:start position:0%
um would we see a substantial spread
 
01:23:20.990 --> 01:23:21.000 align:start position:0%
well certainly in the sense of there's a
 
01:23:22.250 --> 01:23:22.260 align:start position:0%
number of products we sell that
 
01:23:25.970 --> 01:23:25.980 align:start position:0%
fluctuate pretty broadly and so I would
 
01:23:28.130 --> 01:23:28.140 align:start position:0%
say these aren't conservative but
 
01:23:29.330 --> 01:23:29.340 align:start position:0%
they're the second cousin of
 
01:23:29.340 --> 01:23:30.470 align:start position:0%
they're the second cousin of
conservatives

01:23:30.470 --> 01:23:30.480 align:start position:0%
conservatives
 
01:23:33.290 --> 01:23:33.300 align:start position:0%
there are the the lower end of realistic
 
01:23:35.270 --> 01:23:35.280 align:start position:0%
and not high certainly
 
01:23:41.330 --> 01:23:41.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:41.340 --> 01:23:42.410 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:23:42.410 --> 01:23:42.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:23:44.689 --> 01:23:44.699 align:start position:0%
is there anything different this time
 
01:23:47.050 --> 01:23:47.060 align:start position:0%
around for this next to this projection
 
01:23:50.630 --> 01:23:50.640 align:start position:0%
compared with you know previous times or
 
01:23:53.330 --> 01:23:53.340 align:start position:0%
is this just sort of the same situation
 
01:23:56.450 --> 01:23:56.460 align:start position:0%
that you've always struggled with
 
01:23:58.610 --> 01:23:58.620 align:start position:0%
um it's less a struggle now than it used
 
01:24:00.410 --> 01:24:00.420 align:start position:0%
to be only because when I first took
 
01:24:02.930 --> 01:24:02.940 align:start position:0%
this job we depended so much on
 
01:24:02.940 --> 01:24:04.070 align:start position:0%
this job we depended so much on
Powerball

01:24:04.070 --> 01:24:04.080 align:start position:0%
Powerball
 
01:24:06.050 --> 01:24:06.060 align:start position:0%
and Mega Millions that it fluctuated
 
01:24:07.550 --> 01:24:07.560 align:start position:0%
wildly if you looked at our Revenue
 
01:24:09.530 --> 01:24:09.540 align:start position:0%
sheets you would see it look like the
 
01:24:11.990 --> 01:24:12.000 align:start position:0%
Alps and you know up down up down up
 
01:24:14.390 --> 01:24:14.400 align:start position:0%
down it was like Magic Mountain
 
01:24:16.250 --> 01:24:16.260 align:start position:0%
um and now it's because so much of what
 
01:24:19.370 --> 01:24:19.380 align:start position:0%
we sell is more stable that it's far
 
01:24:22.689 --> 01:24:22.699 align:start position:0%
easier easy it's not easy it's more
 
01:24:25.070 --> 01:24:25.080 align:start position:0%
agreeable to give Revenue estimates so
 
01:24:27.110 --> 01:24:27.120 align:start position:0%
we're more confident certainly I am I'm
 
01:24:28.970 --> 01:24:28.980 align:start position:0%
Jim than we were then it would have been
 
01:24:31.070 --> 01:24:31.080 align:start position:0%
10 years ago
 
01:24:34.070 --> 01:24:34.080 align:start position:0%
one of those questions yeah follow-up
 
01:24:36.470 --> 01:24:36.480 align:start position:0%
um this is a little bit different but on
 
01:24:39.169 --> 01:24:39.179 align:start position:0%
on this uh this page that you gave us
 
01:24:39.179 --> 01:24:40.610 align:start position:0%
on this uh this page that you gave us
today

01:24:40.610 --> 01:24:40.620 align:start position:0%
today
 
01:24:40.620 --> 01:24:42.229 align:start position:0%
today
um

01:24:42.229 --> 01:24:42.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:24:46.070 --> 01:24:46.080 align:start position:0%
which is gross or close to gross
 
01:24:47.450 --> 01:24:47.460 align:start position:0%
revenues this is the gross revenues yeah
 
01:24:48.950 --> 01:24:48.960 align:start position:0%
those revenues
 
01:24:48.960 --> 01:24:49.790 align:start position:0%
those revenues
um

01:24:49.790 --> 01:24:49.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:24:52.490 --> 01:24:52.500 align:start position:0%
do you have have this kind of breakdown
 
01:24:56.149 --> 01:24:56.159 align:start position:0%
for the uh not the go the the trans that
 
01:24:58.970 --> 01:24:58.980 align:start position:0%
becomes the transfer we do we do and
 
01:24:58.980 --> 01:24:59.689 align:start position:0%
becomes the transfer we do we do and
it's

01:24:59.689 --> 01:24:59.699 align:start position:0%
it's
 
01:25:02.209 --> 01:25:02.219 align:start position:0%
um it's I'm hesitant to send it out only
 
01:25:04.610 --> 01:25:04.620 align:start position:0%
because like for us if I send you Mega
 
01:25:06.050 --> 01:25:06.060 align:start position:0%
Millions estimate
 
01:25:07.729 --> 01:25:07.739 align:start position:0%
it will fluctuate wildly in Powerball
 
01:25:10.189 --> 01:25:10.199 align:start position:0%
will fluctuate wildly so I'm hesitant to
 
01:25:12.229 --> 01:25:12.239 align:start position:0%
send you the the margin is the margin
 
01:25:13.550 --> 01:25:13.560 align:start position:0%
and so when they're all Blended together
 
01:25:17.630 --> 01:25:17.640 align:start position:0%
it's more agreeable but we do yeah
 
01:25:20.510 --> 01:25:20.520 align:start position:0%
okay representative
 
01:25:23.750 --> 01:25:23.760 align:start position:0%
is there a limit to how Deep Pockets are
 
01:25:25.510 --> 01:25:25.520 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
01:25:28.550 --> 01:25:28.560 align:start position:0%
uh the plethora of games here are they
 
01:25:30.649 --> 01:25:30.659 align:start position:0%
interfering with each other eating into
 
01:25:32.750 --> 01:25:32.760 align:start position:0%
each other some so that's an excellent
 
01:25:34.610 --> 01:25:34.620 align:start position:0%
question representative uh it's one we
 
01:25:37.370 --> 01:25:37.380 align:start position:0%
think about and study all day every day
 
01:25:37.380 --> 01:25:39.590 align:start position:0%
think about and study all day every day
um

01:25:39.590 --> 01:25:39.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:42.110 --> 01:25:42.120 align:start position:0%
the short answer is I don't know what
 
01:25:42.120 --> 01:25:42.950 align:start position:0%
the short answer is I don't know what
the

01:25:42.950 --> 01:25:42.960 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:25:44.450 --> 01:25:44.460 align:start position:0%
limit is
 
01:25:46.970 --> 01:25:46.980 align:start position:0%
I just know we haven't hit it yet
 
01:25:49.189 --> 01:25:49.199 align:start position:0%
for example like sports betting was
 
01:25:51.649 --> 01:25:51.659 align:start position:0%
entirely new Revenue that I don't think
 
01:25:53.870 --> 01:25:53.880 align:start position:0%
cannibalized a dollar from anybody like
 
01:25:57.370 --> 01:25:57.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:00.770 --> 01:26:00.780 align:start position:0%
appropriated or repatriated funds that
 
01:26:02.750 --> 01:26:02.760 align:start position:0%
were in the legal Market or going
 
01:26:05.330 --> 01:26:05.340 align:start position:0%
offline or offshore to bid on Sports
 
01:26:06.890 --> 01:26:06.900 align:start position:0%
like I think sports betting existed in
 
01:26:08.890 --> 01:26:08.900 align:start position:0%
this day before we legalized it we just
 
01:26:12.410 --> 01:26:12.420 align:start position:0%
appropriated it so it's a good question
 
01:26:14.330 --> 01:26:14.340 align:start position:0%
and we studied every day because
 
01:26:16.189 --> 01:26:16.199 align:start position:0%
cannibalization is a big part of our
 
01:26:22.610 --> 01:26:22.620 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:24.770 --> 01:26:24.780 align:start position:0%
representative Army has a question thank
 
01:26:27.410 --> 01:26:27.420 align:start position:0%
you I just wanted to make sure I
 
01:26:30.709 --> 01:26:30.719 align:start position:0%
understood some of these things on on
 
01:26:34.669 --> 01:26:34.679 align:start position:0%
page well 43 of the annual comprehensive
 
01:26:37.189 --> 01:26:37.199 align:start position:0%
Financial reports so presumably if I
 
01:26:39.229 --> 01:26:39.239 align:start position:0%
went online I could find it absolutely
 
01:26:41.510 --> 01:26:41.520 align:start position:0%
the annual Port is um online and
 
01:26:43.250 --> 01:26:43.260 align:start position:0%
presented to fiscal and it's on our
 
01:26:45.290 --> 01:26:45.300 align:start position:0%
website but I thought I put down
 
01:26:48.110 --> 01:26:48.120 align:start position:0%
everything correctly and as you were
 
01:26:51.050 --> 01:26:51.060 align:start position:0%
saying it and uh Instant tickets and
 
01:26:54.890 --> 01:26:54.900 align:start position:0%
delivery whatever delivery is on
 
01:26:58.610 --> 01:26:58.620 align:start position:0%
was that the 1.3 it is yes
 
01:27:01.430 --> 01:27:01.440 align:start position:0%
we've got all these memorized and on
 
01:27:05.030 --> 01:27:05.040 align:start position:0%
that the last page of that uh is this
 
01:27:07.010 --> 01:27:07.020 align:start position:0%
net or gross
 
01:27:10.129 --> 01:27:10.139 align:start position:0%
the net the net is what is labeled as
 
01:27:13.310 --> 01:27:13.320 align:start position:0%
state yes it is yes I mean we haven't
 
01:27:15.709 --> 01:27:15.719 align:start position:0%
deducted expenses from this but yes like
 
01:27:17.570 --> 01:27:17.580 align:start position:0%
our salaries and the like but it's net
 
01:27:20.709 --> 01:27:20.719 align:start position:0%
to the state it's not the net transfer
 
01:27:25.129 --> 01:27:25.139 align:start position:0%
net including Administration costs
 
01:27:26.570 --> 01:27:26.580 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry
 
01:27:28.970 --> 01:27:28.980 align:start position:0%
um by our CFO suggests we don't offset
 
01:27:31.370 --> 01:27:31.380 align:start position:0%
expenses on stroke horse racing we have
 
01:27:33.350 --> 01:27:33.360 align:start position:0%
a minute we have administrative expenses
 
01:27:35.510 --> 01:27:35.520 align:start position:0%
but that's reported it's net revenue on
 
01:27:37.370 --> 01:27:37.380 align:start position:0%
the upper side of the income statement
 
01:27:38.990 --> 01:27:39.000 align:start position:0%
as well so there's no cost of sales
 
01:27:42.649 --> 01:27:42.659 align:start position:0%
coming below that okay so other than the
 
01:27:44.570 --> 01:27:44.580 align:start position:0%
very small percentage of administrative
 
01:27:46.790 --> 01:27:46.800 align:start position:0%
expenses it's
 
01:27:50.330 --> 01:27:50.340 align:start position:0%
it's basically the net I know I know you
 
01:27:53.750 --> 01:27:53.760 align:start position:0%
have very low administrative expenses I
 
01:27:56.209 --> 01:27:56.219 align:start position:0%
started out back in the United States in
 
01:27:58.310 --> 01:27:58.320 align:start position:0%
Gainesville Florida when they were
 
01:28:00.590 --> 01:28:00.600 align:start position:0%
discovering that they were costing 10
 
01:28:07.930 --> 01:28:07.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:10.790 --> 01:28:10.800 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much sorry for the
 
01:28:10.800 --> 01:28:15.110 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much sorry for the
delay

01:28:15.110 --> 01:28:15.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:15.120 --> 01:28:17.510 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:28:17.510 --> 01:28:17.520 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:28:33.350 --> 01:28:33.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:35.030 --> 01:28:35.040 align:start position:0%
uh Madam chair
 
01:28:36.610 --> 01:28:36.620 align:start position:0%
so I have questions when you're ready
 
01:28:39.590 --> 01:28:39.600 align:start position:0%
yes so uh representative Southwest has
 
01:28:42.050 --> 01:28:42.060 align:start position:0%
some uh General comments and questions
 
01:28:44.090 --> 01:28:44.100 align:start position:0%
he'd like to ask go ahead
 
01:28:47.570 --> 01:28:47.580 align:start position:0%
we had emailed back and forth already
 
01:28:49.370 --> 01:28:49.380 align:start position:0%
um I just want to follow up a little
 
01:28:54.129 --> 01:28:54.139 align:start position:0%
more on where all of the 10 raises were
 
01:28:56.629 --> 01:28:56.639 align:start position:0%
some people have asked me about that in
 
01:28:59.390 --> 01:28:59.400 align:start position:0%
my community and the first part is so
 
01:29:01.070 --> 01:29:01.080 align:start position:0%
that's for anyone who is a state
 
01:29:03.590 --> 01:29:03.600 align:start position:0%
employee from Administration all the way
 
01:29:06.050 --> 01:29:06.060 align:start position:0%
down to any Department
 
01:29:07.729 --> 01:29:07.739 align:start position:0%
is that
 
01:29:10.310 --> 01:29:10.320 align:start position:0%
so the the raises are going to be
 
01:29:12.050 --> 01:29:12.060 align:start position:0%
included in House Bill 2. you'll see an
 
01:29:13.430 --> 01:29:13.440 align:start position:0%
appropriation in the house bill too
 
01:29:15.649 --> 01:29:15.659 align:start position:0%
along with some language changes that
 
01:29:19.669 --> 01:29:19.679 align:start position:0%
would adjust salaries for the justices
 
01:29:23.090 --> 01:29:23.100 align:start position:0%
um The Lottery Commission uh commission
 
01:29:26.149 --> 01:29:26.159 align:start position:0%
members as well as for the legislative
 
01:29:27.770 --> 01:29:27.780 align:start position:0%
branch it's uh there's a language
 
01:29:29.390 --> 01:29:29.400 align:start position:0%
there's money in the in the house bill
 
01:29:31.790 --> 01:29:31.800 align:start position:0%
too but there's language that says that
 
01:29:33.709 --> 01:29:33.719 align:start position:0%
the um authorities within the
 
01:29:35.330 --> 01:29:35.340 align:start position:0%
legislative branch would need to approve
 
01:29:37.669 --> 01:29:37.679 align:start position:0%
the raise and do they already know how
 
01:29:40.550 --> 01:29:40.560 align:start position:0%
much the total is give or take yeah it's
 
01:29:42.169 --> 01:29:42.179 align:start position:0%
it's the in the appropriation that's
 
01:29:44.510 --> 01:29:44.520 align:start position:0%
contained in House Bill too and I don't
 
01:29:46.070 --> 01:29:46.080 align:start position:0%
have it right in front of me but I can
 
01:29:48.110 --> 01:29:48.120 align:start position:0%
get that at lunch because people just
 
01:29:49.669 --> 01:29:49.679 align:start position:0%
have been asking about it I want to be
 
01:29:50.990 --> 01:29:51.000 align:start position:0%
clear I think that's a great question
 
01:29:53.510 --> 01:29:53.520 align:start position:0%
and by now we normally have House Bill
 
01:29:56.990 --> 01:29:57.000 align:start position:0%
too it seems like it's been two weeks do
 
01:29:58.310 --> 01:29:58.320 align:start position:0%
we know where that is
 
01:30:02.090 --> 01:30:02.100 align:start position:0%
um it's still being drafted and it's on
 
01:30:03.649 --> 01:30:03.659 align:start position:0%
track for coming out around the same
 
01:30:06.890 --> 01:30:06.900 align:start position:0%
time as it did last budget cycle so it's
 
01:30:08.990 --> 01:30:09.000 align:start position:0%
it's a fairly huge document and it's got
 
01:30:11.090 --> 01:30:11.100 align:start position:0%
over 200 pages that came from the
 
01:30:13.430 --> 01:30:13.440 align:start position:0%
governor so the uh
 
01:30:15.410 --> 01:30:15.420 align:start position:0%
drafting office office of legislative
 
01:30:17.030 --> 01:30:17.040 align:start position:0%
Services is going through that document
 
01:30:20.090 --> 01:30:20.100 align:start position:0%
and it's not as simple as a cut and
 
01:30:22.490 --> 01:30:22.500 align:start position:0%
paste into a bill but they actually have
 
01:30:23.930 --> 01:30:23.940 align:start position:0%
to go in and
 
01:30:26.209 --> 01:30:26.219 align:start position:0%
um one check statutes against what's
 
01:30:28.850 --> 01:30:28.860 align:start position:0%
being suggested in the governor's
 
01:30:31.850 --> 01:30:31.860 align:start position:0%
um bill so if if it's the repeal of the
 
01:30:31.860 --> 01:30:33.169 align:start position:0%
um bill so if if it's the repeal of the
CST

01:30:33.169 --> 01:30:33.179 align:start position:0%
CST
 
01:30:35.629 --> 01:30:35.639 align:start position:0%
the governor may put repeal CST but they
 
01:30:37.430 --> 01:30:37.440 align:start position:0%
have to go into our statutes and make
 
01:30:39.590 --> 01:30:39.600 align:start position:0%
sure that anything that CST might be
 
01:30:41.990 --> 01:30:42.000 align:start position:0%
referenced in is also repealed so it
 
01:30:43.189 --> 01:30:43.199 align:start position:0%
takes a little bit of time in fact
 
01:30:44.450 --> 01:30:44.460 align:start position:0%
they've divided it up among the
 
01:30:47.209 --> 01:30:47.219 align:start position:0%
attorneys within that office and if
 
01:30:49.910 --> 01:30:49.920 align:start position:0%
anybody's been into the department or
 
01:30:52.250 --> 01:30:52.260 align:start position:0%
into the office lately you may
 
01:30:53.390 --> 01:30:53.400 align:start position:0%
understand that they're down to
 
01:30:55.129 --> 01:30:55.139 align:start position:0%
attorneys right now so they've got six
 
01:30:57.830 --> 01:30:57.840 align:start position:0%
attorneys that are working on this
 
01:30:57.840 --> 01:30:58.490 align:start position:0%
attorneys that are working on this
um

01:30:58.490 --> 01:30:58.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:31:01.129 --> 01:31:01.139 align:start position:0%
three of them are essentially brand new
 
01:31:02.390 --> 01:31:02.400 align:start position:0%
this session
 
01:31:04.490 --> 01:31:04.500 align:start position:0%
and um and then three what I would say
 
01:31:06.530 --> 01:31:06.540 align:start position:0%
veteran attorneys so it's taken some
 
01:31:07.970 --> 01:31:07.980 align:start position:0%
time to get it but I don't think it's
 
01:31:10.129 --> 01:31:10.139 align:start position:0%
out of whack yet
 
01:31:11.689 --> 01:31:11.699 align:start position:0%
representative South with you had more
 
01:31:13.610 --> 01:31:13.620 align:start position:0%
questions than I interrupted go ahead no
 
01:31:16.850 --> 01:31:16.860 align:start position:0%
that was on target so we can expect that
 
01:31:19.370 --> 01:31:19.380 align:start position:0%
to be a large number basically but it's
 
01:31:21.950 --> 01:31:21.960 align:start position:0%
going to be then a large at first and
 
01:31:23.390 --> 01:31:23.400 align:start position:0%
then spread out among all the
 
01:31:25.250 --> 01:31:25.260 align:start position:0%
Departments and so on right so the
 
01:31:27.470 --> 01:31:27.480 align:start position:0%
appropriation is by source of funds yeah
 
01:31:30.470 --> 01:31:30.480 align:start position:0%
and I can I can give you a ballpark I
 
01:31:32.030 --> 01:31:32.040 align:start position:0%
just don't have the exact number but the
 
01:31:35.030 --> 01:31:35.040 align:start position:0%
total amount is about 100 million each
 
01:31:35.040 --> 01:31:35.810 align:start position:0%
total amount is about 100 million each
year

01:31:35.810 --> 01:31:35.820 align:start position:0%
year
 
01:31:37.790 --> 01:31:37.800 align:start position:0%
but that comes from all fun sources
 
01:31:39.590 --> 01:31:39.600 align:start position:0%
that'd be general fund right that would
 
01:31:41.330 --> 01:31:41.340 align:start position:0%
be sweepstakes or Lottery Commission
 
01:31:43.189 --> 01:31:43.199 align:start position:0%
that would be other funds that would be
 
01:31:45.290 --> 01:31:45.300 align:start position:0%
federal funds that's that's very helpful
 
01:31:47.930 --> 01:31:47.940 align:start position:0%
and then for us some of the people who
 
01:31:49.669 --> 01:31:49.679 align:start position:0%
are relatively new
 
01:31:52.070 --> 01:31:52.080 align:start position:0%
um could you say a little more about
 
01:31:54.290 --> 01:31:54.300 align:start position:0%
um the Surplus statement and the fact
 
01:31:56.390 --> 01:31:56.400 align:start position:0%
that it isn't necessarily a surplus
 
01:32:00.470 --> 01:32:00.480 align:start position:0%
right so in the governor's executive
 
01:32:02.149 --> 01:32:02.159 align:start position:0%
budget you'll see in there he has a
 
01:32:06.110 --> 01:32:06.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:13.790 --> 01:32:13.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:16.129 --> 01:32:16.139 align:start position:0%
one moment
 
01:32:18.709 --> 01:32:18.719 align:start position:0%
so it's on page 15.
 
01:32:21.410 --> 01:32:21.420 align:start position:0%
so on 14 is um
 
01:32:24.050 --> 01:32:24.060 align:start position:0%
the statement as it 20 through 20
 
01:32:28.010 --> 01:32:28.020 align:start position:0%
through 2022 and then on 15 you'll see
 
01:32:30.350 --> 01:32:30.360 align:start position:0%
excuse me that's the revenues
 
01:32:33.770 --> 01:32:33.780 align:start position:0%
back up one page 13 is the governor's 23
 
01:32:37.490 --> 01:32:37.500 align:start position:0%
through 24 25 Surplus
 
01:32:39.050 --> 01:32:39.060 align:start position:0%
part of what the governor has done in
 
01:32:41.629 --> 01:32:41.639 align:start position:0%
House Bill 2 is appropriated
 
01:32:43.810 --> 01:32:43.820 align:start position:0%
um about
 
01:32:46.550 --> 01:32:46.560 align:start position:0%
550 million dollars
 
01:32:50.390 --> 01:32:50.400 align:start position:0%
of 23 revenue or 23 funds 24 funds and
 
01:32:52.490 --> 01:32:52.500 align:start position:0%
25 funds
 
01:32:54.350 --> 01:32:54.360 align:start position:0%
and what that does is it gets you down
 
01:32:57.169 --> 01:32:57.179 align:start position:0%
to the amount going into the rainy day
 
01:33:00.229 --> 01:33:00.239 align:start position:0%
fund at the end of the biennium
 
01:33:02.330 --> 01:33:02.340 align:start position:0%
so at the end of 23 they're projecting
 
01:33:06.229 --> 01:33:06.239 align:start position:0%
to increase from 159 to 253 and then by
 
01:33:08.450 --> 01:33:08.460 align:start position:0%
the end of 25 the end of the biennium it
 
01:33:11.810 --> 01:33:11.820 align:start position:0%
would be up to 341 in the rainy day fund
 
01:33:15.310 --> 01:33:15.320 align:start position:0%
so in addition to the house bill 2
 
01:33:17.629 --> 01:33:17.639 align:start position:0%
Revenue excuse me Appropriations that
 
01:33:21.290 --> 01:33:21.300 align:start position:0%
the governor is making there's another
 
01:33:24.950 --> 01:33:24.960 align:start position:0%
close to 400 million dollars in
 
01:33:26.450 --> 01:33:26.460 align:start position:0%
legislative specials that have
 
01:33:26.460 --> 01:33:27.950 align:start position:0%
legislative specials that have
Appropriations

01:33:27.950 --> 01:33:27.960 align:start position:0%
Appropriations
 
01:33:30.050 --> 01:33:30.060 align:start position:0%
so at this point there's really not a
 
01:33:32.390 --> 01:33:32.400 align:start position:0%
surplus until decisions are made on
 
01:33:34.250 --> 01:33:34.260 align:start position:0%
those bills that have Appropriations
 
01:33:37.010 --> 01:33:37.020 align:start position:0%
attached to them and until the budget is
 
01:33:39.590 --> 01:33:39.600 align:start position:0%
determined and then as part of our
 
01:33:42.350 --> 01:33:42.360 align:start position:0%
office we would update the Surplus for
 
01:33:44.330 --> 01:33:44.340 align:start position:0%
the house so based on decisions that the
 
01:33:46.310 --> 01:33:46.320 align:start position:0%
house makes in terms of legislative
 
01:33:48.350 --> 01:33:48.360 align:start position:0%
specials you may pass or decisions you
 
01:33:49.729 --> 01:33:49.739 align:start position:0%
make in the operating budget and with
 
01:33:52.129 --> 01:33:52.139 align:start position:0%
your revenues we would update that to
 
01:33:54.229 --> 01:33:54.239 align:start position:0%
reflect your your decision and show it
 
01:33:56.689 --> 01:33:56.699 align:start position:0%
against the governor's projections and
 
01:33:58.129 --> 01:33:58.139 align:start position:0%
then the Senate would do the same thing
 
01:34:00.770 --> 01:34:00.780 align:start position:0%
the Senate would come through and and do
 
01:34:03.709 --> 01:34:03.719 align:start position:0%
estimates for its revenues would do a
 
01:34:05.990 --> 01:34:06.000 align:start position:0%
budget and make priorities as it seems
 
01:34:09.169 --> 01:34:09.179 align:start position:0%
to need as well as a pro Appropriations
 
01:34:10.850 --> 01:34:10.860 align:start position:0%
and legislative specials that they might
 
01:34:10.860 --> 01:34:12.169 align:start position:0%
and legislative specials that they might
pass

01:34:12.169 --> 01:34:12.179 align:start position:0%
pass
 
01:34:15.709 --> 01:34:15.719 align:start position:0%
so we won't truly know how much of a
 
01:34:17.870 --> 01:34:17.880 align:start position:0%
surplus there is until you get done
 
01:34:19.790 --> 01:34:19.800 align:start position:0%
making all those decisions because you
 
01:34:22.189 --> 01:34:22.199 align:start position:0%
may spend a lot of that money
 
01:34:25.669 --> 01:34:25.679 align:start position:0%
um through House Bill 2 or other uh
 
01:34:28.010 --> 01:34:28.020 align:start position:0%
legislative specials that's helpful and
 
01:34:31.490 --> 01:34:31.500 align:start position:0%
then for our committee if we do make
 
01:34:33.890 --> 01:34:33.900 align:start position:0%
changes that pass basically those would
 
01:34:35.629 --> 01:34:35.639 align:start position:0%
go into the Surplus statement as well
 
01:34:37.729 --> 01:34:37.739 align:start position:0%
that's correct so other you're going to
 
01:34:39.290 --> 01:34:39.300 align:start position:0%
come out of this committee with your
 
01:34:41.090 --> 01:34:41.100 align:start position:0%
unrestricted revenues for the general
 
01:34:43.189 --> 01:34:43.199 align:start position:0%
fund the highway fund and the Fish and
 
01:34:44.629 --> 01:34:44.639 align:start position:0%
Game fund
 
01:34:47.450 --> 01:34:47.460 align:start position:0%
from that well my office will do an
 
01:34:49.430 --> 01:34:49.440 align:start position:0%
amendment to House Bill one to reflect
 
01:34:50.810 --> 01:34:50.820 align:start position:0%
this committee's decisions on the
 
01:34:52.910 --> 01:34:52.920 align:start position:0%
unrestricted revenues any other
 
01:34:54.890 --> 01:34:54.900 align:start position:0%
decisions that are made as it relates to
 
01:34:57.890 --> 01:34:57.900 align:start position:0%
revenues for instance if you were to
 
01:35:00.110 --> 01:35:00.120 align:start position:0%
agree with the governor's repeal of the
 
01:35:03.590 --> 01:35:03.600 align:start position:0%
CST as the house body and you pass
 
01:35:06.830 --> 01:35:06.840 align:start position:0%
legislation to do that we would reflect
 
01:35:09.470 --> 01:35:09.480 align:start position:0%
that by removing it on the Surplus
 
01:35:11.030 --> 01:35:11.040 align:start position:0%
statement there'd be a line below the
 
01:35:13.129 --> 01:35:13.139 align:start position:0%
what we call schedule two that would
 
01:35:14.870 --> 01:35:14.880 align:start position:0%
make an adjustment to revenue to reflect
 
01:35:18.890 --> 01:35:18.900 align:start position:0%
the the change in the CST if you added
 
01:35:20.930 --> 01:35:20.940 align:start position:0%
um you know you decided to go back up to
 
01:35:22.490 --> 01:35:22.500 align:start position:0%
nine percent on the community on the
 
01:35:24.350 --> 01:35:24.360 align:start position:0%
meals and rooms tax through a
 
01:35:26.270 --> 01:35:26.280 align:start position:0%
legislative special and that passed the
 
01:35:28.910 --> 01:35:28.920 align:start position:0%
body that potential increase in Revenue
 
01:35:30.530 --> 01:35:30.540 align:start position:0%
again would be carried on what we call
 
01:35:33.530 --> 01:35:33.540 align:start position:0%
schedule two of the Surplus statement to
 
01:35:35.870 --> 01:35:35.880 align:start position:0%
adjust the revenues at the end so that
 
01:35:38.450 --> 01:35:38.460 align:start position:0%
at the end of the process the
 
01:35:40.010 --> 01:35:40.020 align:start position:0%
legislative body knows that it will have
 
01:35:41.990 --> 01:35:42.000 align:start position:0%
a balanced budget so at the end of
 
01:35:43.970 --> 01:35:43.980 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 25 that your budget would be
 
01:35:46.550 --> 01:35:46.560 align:start position:0%
balanced thank you madam chair for
 
01:35:47.810 --> 01:35:47.820 align:start position:0%
indulging me
 
01:35:49.490 --> 01:35:49.500 align:start position:0%
absolutely those are good observations
 
01:35:51.110 --> 01:35:51.120 align:start position:0%
and questions representative Almy and
 
01:35:53.270 --> 01:35:53.280 align:start position:0%
then representative Platt
 
01:35:53.280 --> 01:35:54.590 align:start position:0%
then representative Platt
on

01:35:54.590 --> 01:35:54.600 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:35:56.090 --> 01:35:56.100 align:start position:0%
could you
 
01:35:59.209 --> 01:35:59.219 align:start position:0%
explain to us what it takes to get money
 
01:36:01.610 --> 01:36:01.620 align:start position:0%
out of the rainy day fund in times of
 
01:36:01.620 --> 01:36:02.530 align:start position:0%
out of the rainy day fund in times of
emergency

01:36:02.530 --> 01:36:02.540 align:start position:0%
emergency
 
01:36:07.370 --> 01:36:07.380 align:start position:0%
and on and I think we must have done it
 
01:36:07.380 --> 01:36:09.290 align:start position:0%
and on and I think we must have done it
in

01:36:09.290 --> 01:36:09.300 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:36:13.370 --> 01:36:13.380 align:start position:0%
in on 08 no9
 
01:36:16.430 --> 01:36:16.440 align:start position:0%
if there was any left by 0-9 so how did
 
01:36:18.290 --> 01:36:18.300 align:start position:0%
we do that because I don't think we
 
01:36:20.510 --> 01:36:20.520 align:start position:0%
could use what's in the
 
01:36:24.530 --> 01:36:24.540 align:start position:0%
in the legislation yeah so by Statute if
 
01:36:25.910 --> 01:36:25.920 align:start position:0%
your revenues
 
01:36:28.010 --> 01:36:28.020 align:start position:0%
are less than what you anticipated in
 
01:36:30.050 --> 01:36:30.060 align:start position:0%
your expense or and or your expenditures
 
01:36:31.729 --> 01:36:31.739 align:start position:0%
are more than you anticipated and you
 
01:36:33.290 --> 01:36:33.300 align:start position:0%
don't have enough money
 
01:36:36.350 --> 01:36:36.360 align:start position:0%
to meet your obligations by law at the
 
01:36:38.030 --> 01:36:38.040 align:start position:0%
end of the biennium money would be the
 
01:36:39.830 --> 01:36:39.840 align:start position:0%
transferred would be transferred out of
 
01:36:42.229 --> 01:36:42.239 align:start position:0%
the rainy day fund
 
01:36:44.830 --> 01:36:44.840 align:start position:0%
um and and that did happen back in
 
01:36:48.470 --> 01:36:48.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:50.810 --> 01:36:50.820 align:start position:0%
11 I think it was
 
01:36:53.149 --> 01:36:53.159 align:start position:0%
well it was maybe it was on nine there
 
01:36:55.010 --> 01:36:55.020 align:start position:0%
was 89 million dollars taken out of the
 
01:36:57.110 --> 01:36:57.120 align:start position:0%
rainy day fund and used it for operating
 
01:36:57.120 --> 01:36:59.030 align:start position:0%
rainy day fund and used it for operating
expenses

01:36:59.030 --> 01:36:59.040 align:start position:0%
expenses
 
01:37:01.250 --> 01:37:01.260 align:start position:0%
that all being said
 
01:37:03.890 --> 01:37:03.900 align:start position:0%
if law is suspended
 
01:37:05.750 --> 01:37:05.760 align:start position:0%
you can take money out of the rainy day
 
01:37:07.729 --> 01:37:07.739 align:start position:0%
fund as you did last year with the
 
01:37:10.189 --> 01:37:10.199 align:start position:0%
settlement money as it relates to the
 
01:37:10.199 --> 01:37:11.750 align:start position:0%
settlement money as it relates to the
YDC

01:37:11.750 --> 01:37:11.760 align:start position:0%
YDC
 
01:37:13.669 --> 01:37:13.679 align:start position:0%
so you took 100 million the legislature
 
01:37:15.229 --> 01:37:15.239 align:start position:0%
took 100 million dollars out of the
 
01:37:17.870 --> 01:37:17.880 align:start position:0%
rainy day fund and you've locked that up
 
01:37:20.149 --> 01:37:20.159 align:start position:0%
to be used towards the potential
 
01:37:22.129 --> 01:37:22.139 align:start position:0%
settlements that might be come to as it
 
01:37:27.050 --> 01:37:27.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:30.169 --> 01:37:30.179 align:start position:0%
follow up and then represent
 
01:37:35.330 --> 01:37:35.340 align:start position:0%
yes I think I I was told but not very
 
01:37:40.490 --> 01:37:40.500 align:start position:0%
often that it takes on if we used the uh
 
01:37:44.629 --> 01:37:44.639 align:start position:0%
short of Revenue section uh it we would
 
01:37:47.149 --> 01:37:47.159 align:start position:0%
have to be 20 percent under our
 
01:37:48.890 --> 01:37:48.900 align:start position:0%
estimated revenues
 
01:37:50.990 --> 01:37:51.000 align:start position:0%
oh I'd have to check to see if there's a
 
01:37:53.510 --> 01:37:53.520 align:start position:0%
threshold but I don't recall off the top
 
01:37:57.890 --> 01:37:57.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:59.750 --> 01:37:59.760 align:start position:0%
statement which will lead to a question
 
01:38:04.070 --> 01:38:04.080 align:start position:0%
I'm not a sanguine at all as uh Mr Jerry
 
01:38:06.410 --> 01:38:06.420 align:start position:0%
is that we're going to avoid a recession
 
01:38:11.770 --> 01:38:11.780 align:start position:0%
and I I see the uh feds keep racking up
 
01:38:14.810 --> 01:38:14.820 align:start position:0%
raising the interest rates I see Wall
 
01:38:16.490 --> 01:38:16.500 align:start position:0%
Street Journal vignettes they're all
 
01:38:18.350 --> 01:38:18.360 align:start position:0%
fact but I add together
 
01:38:20.510 --> 01:38:20.520 align:start position:0%
uh and I won't get into the detail and
 
01:38:22.850 --> 01:38:22.860 align:start position:0%
it's only my opinion but that led to a
 
01:38:25.610 --> 01:38:25.620 align:start position:0%
question I asked through you to dra
 
01:38:27.950 --> 01:38:27.960 align:start position:0%
which is what is the real estate Revenue
 
01:38:31.310 --> 01:38:31.320 align:start position:0%
real estate transfer tax revenue been in
 
01:38:33.470 --> 01:38:33.480 align:start position:0%
previous recession years adjusted for
 
01:38:35.689 --> 01:38:35.699 align:start position:0%
today's housing prices to see if we had
 
01:38:38.330 --> 01:38:38.340 align:start position:0%
some sort of data we could apply here if
 
01:38:40.510 --> 01:38:40.520 align:start position:0%
there were a recession
 
01:38:43.250 --> 01:38:43.260 align:start position:0%
so good news at one o'clock when dra
 
01:38:45.110 --> 01:38:45.120 align:start position:0%
comes back in they'll be providing you
 
01:38:46.550 --> 01:38:46.560 align:start position:0%
some information related to that
 
01:38:46.560 --> 01:38:48.709 align:start position:0%
some information related to that
question

01:38:48.709 --> 01:38:48.719 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:38:50.330 --> 01:38:50.340 align:start position:0%
representative Doucette has a question
 
01:38:54.050 --> 01:38:54.060 align:start position:0%
or statement real quick is there a a cap
 
01:38:56.810 --> 01:38:56.820 align:start position:0%
specific to the rainy day fund and what
 
01:38:59.390 --> 01:38:59.400 align:start position:0%
is that cap so there's a cap at the end
 
01:39:03.530 --> 01:39:03.540 align:start position:0%
of the biennium you can't exceed 10 of
 
01:39:05.629 --> 01:39:05.639 align:start position:0%
your general fund Revenue so right now
 
01:39:07.910 --> 01:39:07.920 align:start position:0%
it's about 400 million dollars
 
01:39:07.920 --> 01:39:13.070 align:start position:0%
it's about 400 million dollars
approximately

01:39:13.070 --> 01:39:13.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:13.080 --> 01:39:24.830 align:start position:0%
 
representative

01:39:24.830 --> 01:39:24.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:32.110 --> 01:39:32.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:35.510 --> 01:39:35.520 align:start position:0%
okay it representative fellows
 
01:39:38.390 --> 01:39:38.400 align:start position:0%
um thank you I'm wondering uh Chris if
 
01:39:40.850 --> 01:39:40.860 align:start position:0%
you can just help me understand page 13
 
01:39:48.290 --> 01:39:48.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:51.370 --> 01:39:51.380 align:start position:0%
so so it's down under the legislative
 
01:39:54.550 --> 01:39:54.560 align:start position:0%
editions it says
 
01:39:54.560 --> 01:39:56.169 align:start position:0%
editions it says
sb2

01:39:56.169 --> 01:39:56.179 align:start position:0%
sb2
 
01:40:00.910 --> 01:40:00.920 align:start position:0%
2023 session and it and it already has
 
01:40:03.830 --> 01:40:03.840 align:start position:0%
deductions there but we didn't we
 
01:40:06.709 --> 01:40:06.719 align:start position:0%
haven't passed any bills I mean you know
 
01:40:09.110 --> 01:40:09.120 align:start position:0%
we had no bills have been enacted I
 
01:40:12.770 --> 01:40:12.780 align:start position:0%
don't understand what that represents
 
01:40:15.590 --> 01:40:15.600 align:start position:0%
so in House Bill 2 the legislature has
 
01:40:17.629 --> 01:40:17.639 align:start position:0%
at times appropriated funds from the
 
01:40:20.090 --> 01:40:20.100 align:start position:0%
current by uh fiscal year that you're in
 
01:40:21.830 --> 01:40:21.840 align:start position:0%
and you've made it non-lapsing through
 
01:40:25.490 --> 01:40:25.500 align:start position:0%
the biennium you've done this in 21 and
 
01:40:28.370 --> 01:40:28.380 align:start position:0%
19 I think as far back as 17 and off the
 
01:40:29.990 --> 01:40:30.000 align:start position:0%
top of my head where there was excess
 
01:40:32.169 --> 01:40:32.179 align:start position:0%
Revenue that the legislature
 
01:40:35.450 --> 01:40:35.460 align:start position:0%
appropriated for a purpose and and move
 
01:40:37.729 --> 01:40:37.739 align:start position:0%
that forward through the next biennium
 
01:40:39.649 --> 01:40:39.659 align:start position:0%
so that is what you see with that line
 
01:40:41.149 --> 01:40:41.159 align:start position:0%
House Bill too that's the governor's
 
01:40:43.250 --> 01:40:43.260 align:start position:0%
Appropriations in House Bill 2 for
 
01:40:46.790 --> 01:40:46.800 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 23 would equal about 224.5
 
01:40:49.490 --> 01:40:49.500 align:start position:0%
million dollars of General funds of
 
01:40:51.110 --> 01:40:51.120 align:start position:0%
which part of that
 
01:40:53.750 --> 01:40:53.760 align:start position:0%
um excuse me and then you you look over
 
01:40:56.570 --> 01:40:56.580 align:start position:0%
to 24 you have 89 million and 12.5 for a
 
01:40:59.649 --> 01:40:59.659 align:start position:0%
total of 105 and then
 
01:41:03.290 --> 01:41:03.300 align:start position:0%
57.75 for a total of 132 and 25. so
 
01:41:04.610 --> 01:41:04.620 align:start position:0%
these are all Appropriations that will
 
01:41:07.310 --> 01:41:07.320 align:start position:0%
be contained in house bill 2. for the
 
01:41:09.590 --> 01:41:09.600 align:start position:0%
24-25 number that you see for the
 
01:41:11.090 --> 01:41:11.100 align:start position:0%
general fund that a piece of that will
 
01:41:15.470 --> 01:41:15.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:17.629 --> 01:41:17.639 align:start position:0%
the other thing is if you look at 23
 
01:41:19.129 --> 01:41:19.139 align:start position:0%
you're going to see just above that line
 
01:41:20.990 --> 01:41:21.000 align:start position:0%
it says law is a 2022 additional
 
01:41:23.450 --> 01:41:23.460 align:start position:0%
Appropriations so last year the
 
01:41:26.030 --> 01:41:26.040 align:start position:0%
legislature appropriated funds for
 
01:41:29.149 --> 01:41:29.159 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 22 because of the um how
 
01:41:31.010 --> 01:41:31.020 align:start position:0%
well revenues were doing in an effort to
 
01:41:32.930 --> 01:41:32.940 align:start position:0%
spend some of that money in in areas
 
01:41:34.669 --> 01:41:34.679 align:start position:0%
that the legislature felt would be
 
01:41:36.770 --> 01:41:36.780 align:start position:0%
important some of those Appropriations
 
01:41:36.780 --> 01:41:38.870 align:start position:0%
important some of those Appropriations
didn't

01:41:38.870 --> 01:41:38.880 align:start position:0%
didn't
 
01:41:41.570 --> 01:41:41.580 align:start position:0%
um get used because of the timing
 
01:41:44.149 --> 01:41:44.159 align:start position:0%
so they're going to be booked in the
 
01:41:46.550 --> 01:41:46.560 align:start position:0%
accounting this year
 
01:41:49.129 --> 01:41:49.139 align:start position:0%
so that's what the 279 million dollars
 
01:41:50.870 --> 01:41:50.880 align:start position:0%
that that's from
 
01:41:52.850 --> 01:41:52.860 align:start position:0%
Appropriations made in 22 that were
 
01:41:58.310 --> 01:41:58.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:58.320 --> 01:42:00.169 align:start position:0%
 
representative

01:42:00.169 --> 01:42:00.179 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:42:01.970 --> 01:42:01.980 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair I want to go back
 
01:42:04.209 --> 01:42:04.219 align:start position:0%
to the salary increases for a moment
 
01:42:07.970 --> 01:42:07.980 align:start position:0%
is the percentage increase in aggregate
 
01:42:11.510 --> 01:42:11.520 align:start position:0%
for all jobs or is it a flat percentage
 
01:42:12.910 --> 01:42:12.920 align:start position:0%
for every
 
01:42:12.920 --> 01:42:14.510 align:start position:0%
for every
employee

01:42:14.510 --> 01:42:14.520 align:start position:0%
employee
 
01:42:17.390 --> 01:42:17.400 align:start position:0%
so the union negotiated with the
 
01:42:20.810 --> 01:42:20.820 align:start position:0%
executive team a 10 pay raise for
 
01:42:23.149 --> 01:42:23.159 align:start position:0%
everybody so it's each each person will
 
01:42:25.129 --> 01:42:25.139 align:start position:0%
get 10 of their salary
 
01:42:27.050 --> 01:42:27.060 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you two percent in the
 
01:42:29.030 --> 01:42:29.040 align:start position:0%
second year
 
01:42:30.709 --> 01:42:30.719 align:start position:0%
um so that's what the union negotiated
 
01:42:33.830 --> 01:42:33.840 align:start position:0%
the what we call unrepresented that's
 
01:42:35.209 --> 01:42:35.219 align:start position:0%
what um some of the language in House
 
01:42:36.830 --> 01:42:36.840 align:start position:0%
Bill 2 addresses so there are people who
 
01:42:38.270 --> 01:42:38.280 align:start position:0%
aren't part of the Union
 
01:42:40.790 --> 01:42:40.800 align:start position:0%
that um the decision has been made to
 
01:42:43.370 --> 01:42:43.380 align:start position:0%
give them what the unions negotiated so
 
01:42:45.770 --> 01:42:45.780 align:start position:0%
it would be some agencies have members
 
01:42:47.930 --> 01:42:47.940 align:start position:0%
that aren't part of the Union you have a
 
01:42:49.669 --> 01:42:49.679 align:start position:0%
administrative staff that aren't part of
 
01:42:52.070 --> 01:42:52.080 align:start position:0%
the union and then you have employees in
 
01:42:53.570 --> 01:42:53.580 align:start position:0%
the legislative branch and in the
 
01:42:55.010 --> 01:42:55.020 align:start position:0%
judicial branch that aren't part of a
 
01:42:57.229 --> 01:42:57.239 align:start position:0%
union that would be eligible for the pay
 
01:42:59.149 --> 01:42:59.159 align:start position:0%
raise and that's what that's addressing
 
01:43:01.609 --> 01:43:01.619 align:start position:0%
and this and that would be on top of the
 
01:43:03.530 --> 01:43:03.540 align:start position:0%
regular step increases they're already
 
01:43:06.890 --> 01:43:06.900 align:start position:0%
getting if they're getting one yeah it's
 
01:43:08.810 --> 01:43:08.820 align:start position:0%
admin Services would have the number
 
01:43:10.910 --> 01:43:10.920 align:start position:0%
better than I but for a period of time
 
01:43:13.609 --> 01:43:13.619 align:start position:0%
many positions had been filled for such
 
01:43:15.530 --> 01:43:15.540 align:start position:0%
a long time by the same person that
 
01:43:17.510 --> 01:43:17.520 align:start position:0%
individuals were at Max or close to at
 
01:43:23.510 --> 01:43:23.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:23.520 --> 01:43:28.790 align:start position:0%
 
representative

01:43:28.790 --> 01:43:28.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:32.689 --> 01:43:32.699 align:start position:0%
do you have uh an idea of how what the
 
01:43:34.790 --> 01:43:34.800 align:start position:0%
inflation has been since the last time
 
01:43:38.390 --> 01:43:38.400 align:start position:0%
there was a salary increase
 
01:43:40.729 --> 01:43:40.739 align:start position:0%
like this
 
01:43:43.669 --> 01:43:43.679 align:start position:0%
or something like this so I for the
 
01:43:43.679 --> 01:43:45.229 align:start position:0%
or something like this so I for the
Union

01:43:45.229 --> 01:43:45.239 align:start position:0%
Union
 
01:43:48.470 --> 01:43:48.480 align:start position:0%
I I don't have anything official I mean
 
01:43:50.570 --> 01:43:50.580 align:start position:0%
in our office we were looking around and
 
01:43:52.790 --> 01:43:52.800 align:start position:0%
it appears that
 
01:43:56.030 --> 01:43:56.040 align:start position:0%
um potentially this this increase that's
 
01:43:58.129 --> 01:43:58.139 align:start position:0%
being proposed would um kind of take
 
01:43:59.750 --> 01:43:59.760 align:start position:0%
care of aligning the salaries with
 
01:44:01.790 --> 01:44:01.800 align:start position:0%
inflation over a period of time
 
01:44:04.970 --> 01:44:04.980 align:start position:0%
but I don't have any specific figures
 
01:44:11.629 --> 01:44:11.639 align:start position:0%
yes and and the other question is oh is
 
01:44:15.890 --> 01:44:15.900 align:start position:0%
there any place in the budget area where
 
01:44:20.689 --> 01:44:20.699 align:start position:0%
he's taking care of the fact that on
 
01:44:24.770 --> 01:44:24.780 align:start position:0%
the nursing homes are
 
01:44:29.330 --> 01:44:29.340 align:start position:0%
on our that are County run
 
01:44:31.729 --> 01:44:31.739 align:start position:0%
are having to increase their salaries
 
01:44:37.010 --> 01:44:37.020 align:start position:0%
and the um the Meals on Wheels people
 
01:44:39.890 --> 01:44:39.900 align:start position:0%
and senior centers and such are having
 
01:44:42.350 --> 01:44:42.360 align:start position:0%
to increase their salaries
 
01:44:45.410 --> 01:44:45.420 align:start position:0%
so the county cap issue is addressed in
 
01:44:45.420 --> 01:44:46.550 align:start position:0%
so the county cap issue is addressed in
um

01:44:46.550 --> 01:44:46.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:44:48.410 --> 01:44:48.420 align:start position:0%
in the House Bill 2 was part of the
 
01:44:50.689 --> 01:44:50.699 align:start position:0%
operating budget as well
 
01:44:50.699 --> 01:44:51.590 align:start position:0%
operating budget as well
um

01:44:51.590 --> 01:44:51.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:44:54.590 --> 01:44:54.600 align:start position:0%
that's adjusted each biennium
 
01:44:57.169 --> 01:44:57.179 align:start position:0%
I can't say it's addressing all of what
 
01:44:58.970 --> 01:44:58.980 align:start position:0%
your concerns might be but there's an
 
01:45:01.430 --> 01:45:01.440 align:start position:0%
increase in the number of that cap in
 
01:45:03.050 --> 01:45:03.060 align:start position:0%
terms of rates for programs such as
 
01:45:05.470 --> 01:45:05.480 align:start position:0%
meals and Meals on Wheels and and
 
01:45:08.149 --> 01:45:08.159 align:start position:0%
providers that might provide home health
 
01:45:11.689 --> 01:45:11.699 align:start position:0%
or home care that's negotiated through
 
01:45:13.430 --> 01:45:13.440 align:start position:0%
rates through the operating budget of
 
01:45:16.070 --> 01:45:16.080 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services so as Finance
 
01:45:18.830 --> 01:45:18.840 align:start position:0%
works on the operating budget for Health
 
01:45:20.510 --> 01:45:20.520 align:start position:0%
and Human Services there may be some
 
01:45:22.669 --> 01:45:22.679 align:start position:0%
adjustments I don't know what was
 
01:45:24.530 --> 01:45:24.540 align:start position:0%
included in the base numbers that the
 
01:45:27.350 --> 01:45:27.360 align:start position:0%
governor has in terms of helping out
 
01:45:30.169 --> 01:45:30.179 align:start position:0%
some of those entities but something we
 
01:45:31.850 --> 01:45:31.860 align:start position:0%
could probably get you
 
01:45:33.950 --> 01:45:33.960 align:start position:0%
one other just quick comment I know that
 
01:45:35.570 --> 01:45:35.580 align:start position:0%
Finance because they have a number of
 
01:45:37.609 --> 01:45:37.619 align:start position:0%
questions around the pay raise is trying
 
01:45:38.689 --> 01:45:38.699 align:start position:0%
to schedule a meeting with
 
01:45:40.209 --> 01:45:40.219 align:start position:0%
administrative services
 
01:45:43.430 --> 01:45:43.440 align:start position:0%
to come in and talk about how the pay
 
01:45:46.850 --> 01:45:46.860 align:start position:0%
raise works and what would impact and
 
01:45:48.530 --> 01:45:48.540 align:start position:0%
probably address a lot of the questions
 
01:45:50.930 --> 01:45:50.940 align:start position:0%
that members here are having so if I
 
01:45:52.729 --> 01:45:52.739 align:start position:0%
find that date I will email it to you
 
01:45:55.070 --> 01:45:55.080 align:start position:0%
and let you know when they're going to
 
01:45:58.910 --> 01:45:58.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:01.910 --> 01:46:01.920 align:start position:0%
okay folks we have 15 minutes before the
 
01:46:04.669 --> 01:46:04.679 align:start position:0%
lunch break we could continue and maybe
 
01:46:07.729 --> 01:46:07.739 align:start position:0%
look at an easier Revenue item to
 
01:46:10.189 --> 01:46:10.199 align:start position:0%
discuss and take a straw vote on or we
 
01:46:13.189 --> 01:46:13.199 align:start position:0%
could break now come back at one and and
 
01:46:15.649 --> 01:46:15.659 align:start position:0%
start then what's the pleasure of the
 
01:46:17.930 --> 01:46:17.940 align:start position:0%
committee members
 
01:46:19.910 --> 01:46:19.920 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:46:22.250 --> 01:46:22.260 align:start position:0%
guys have another 15 minutes in you to
 
01:46:23.390 --> 01:46:23.400 align:start position:0%
do some stuff
 
01:46:23.400 --> 01:46:24.770 align:start position:0%
do some stuff
okay

01:46:24.770 --> 01:46:24.780 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:46:26.270 --> 01:46:26.280 align:start position:0%
Chris you had mentioned a couple of
 
01:46:29.649 --> 01:46:29.659 align:start position:0%
eight uh agency numbers we could look at
 
01:46:32.570 --> 01:46:32.580 align:start position:0%
so last time we met you were
 
01:46:34.910 --> 01:46:34.920 align:start position:0%
um considering looking at the other and
 
01:46:36.410 --> 01:46:36.420 align:start position:0%
then I asked you to pause on that
 
01:46:38.330 --> 01:46:38.340 align:start position:0%
because I was concerned about why my
 
01:46:40.970 --> 01:46:40.980 align:start position:0%
number was so out of whack I've sent you
 
01:46:43.250 --> 01:46:43.260 align:start position:0%
a couple of emails to explain that I
 
01:46:45.950 --> 01:46:45.960 align:start position:0%
asked a question of the treasurer and um
 
01:46:47.629 --> 01:46:47.639 align:start position:0%
the Comptroller
 
01:46:50.810 --> 01:46:50.820 align:start position:0%
and my communication probably wasn't as
 
01:46:52.250 --> 01:46:52.260 align:start position:0%
clear as it should have been they
 
01:46:54.410 --> 01:46:54.420 align:start position:0%
thought I was talking about 24 25 when I
 
01:46:56.629 --> 01:46:56.639 align:start position:0%
asked the question they agreed with me
 
01:46:58.970 --> 01:46:58.980 align:start position:0%
um I in my head I was including 23 when
 
01:47:01.310 --> 01:47:01.320 align:start position:0%
in fact they weren't so
 
01:47:04.490 --> 01:47:04.500 align:start position:0%
um the number that for 23 is the 97
 
01:47:05.990 --> 01:47:06.000 align:start position:0%
million dollars and I've explained to
 
01:47:12.109 --> 01:47:12.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:18.169 --> 01:47:18.179 align:start position:0%
the agency's recommended number of 79
 
01:47:20.689 --> 01:47:20.699 align:start position:0%
76 million
 
01:47:23.270 --> 01:47:23.280 align:start position:0%
which included 13
 
01:47:25.490 --> 01:47:25.500 align:start position:0%
um included 17 million of the interest
 
01:47:27.290 --> 01:47:27.300 align:start position:0%
that was being discussed so if you
 
01:47:28.970 --> 01:47:28.980 align:start position:0%
recall the treasurer had presented that
 
01:47:30.410 --> 01:47:30.420 align:start position:0%
there was 35 million dollars of
 
01:47:33.830 --> 01:47:33.840 align:start position:0%
potential Revenue interest in 23 17 of
 
01:47:37.490 --> 01:47:37.500 align:start position:0%
that was already in that number of 76.
 
01:47:39.649 --> 01:47:39.659 align:start position:0%
so 18 million should have been added to
 
01:47:42.229 --> 01:47:42.239 align:start position:0%
76. the other thing that wasn't included
 
01:47:44.510 --> 01:47:44.520 align:start position:0%
was a three million dollar lawsuit so
 
01:47:46.189 --> 01:47:46.199 align:start position:0%
that's not typically budget but there
 
01:47:47.689 --> 01:47:47.699 align:start position:0%
would excuse me settlement not lawsuit
 
01:47:49.189 --> 01:47:49.199 align:start position:0%
there was three million dollars that
 
01:47:51.950 --> 01:47:51.960 align:start position:0%
came in in 2023 related to a uh
 
01:47:53.750 --> 01:47:53.760 align:start position:0%
settlement so that would be included in
 
01:47:59.750 --> 01:47:59.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:02.030 --> 01:48:02.040 align:start position:0%
so just to confirm what you're talking
 
01:48:04.790 --> 01:48:04.800 align:start position:0%
about as we're looking at our major big
 
01:48:08.209 --> 01:48:08.219 align:start position:0%
worksheet we're looking under column l
 
01:48:11.030 --> 01:48:11.040 align:start position:0%
general fund right yep which is
 
01:48:12.950 --> 01:48:12.960 align:start position:0%
Department administrative Services quote
 
01:48:14.390 --> 01:48:14.400 align:start position:0%
unquote other
 
01:48:16.850 --> 01:48:16.860 align:start position:0%
and what we've heard from the governor
 
01:48:20.810 --> 01:48:20.820 align:start position:0%
and from Chris is that the number for
 
01:48:24.470 --> 01:48:24.480 align:start position:0%
Line 13 house Ways and Means should
 
01:48:28.910 --> 01:48:28.920 align:start position:0%
potentially be 97. if we agree
 
01:48:31.330 --> 01:48:31.340 align:start position:0%
if you agree uh right okay
 
01:48:34.490 --> 01:48:34.500 align:start position:0%
number was 97 so it would be up to you
 
01:48:36.169 --> 01:48:36.179 align:start position:0%
to decide if you agree with that or not
 
01:48:39.709 --> 01:48:39.719 align:start position:0%
okay all right yes please representative
 
01:48:42.649 --> 01:48:42.659 align:start position:0%
where did the 76 come from all of a
 
01:48:42.659 --> 01:48:47.030 align:start position:0%
where did the 76 come from all of a
sudden

01:48:47.030 --> 01:48:47.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:49.550 --> 01:48:49.560 align:start position:0%
so when administrative Services came
 
01:48:52.070 --> 01:48:52.080 align:start position:0%
before you in their document they had a
 
01:48:55.550 --> 01:48:55.560 align:start position:0%
number 76. so that didn't include
 
01:48:57.649 --> 01:48:57.659 align:start position:0%
18 million dollars of Interest or the
 
01:49:00.290 --> 01:49:00.300 align:start position:0%
legal settlement
 
01:49:01.910 --> 01:49:01.920 align:start position:0%
so they were just showing you that you
 
01:49:03.890 --> 01:49:03.900 align:start position:0%
know for 23 if you were comparing all
 
01:49:05.870 --> 01:49:05.880 align:start position:0%
the revenues that they typically track I
 
01:49:12.109 --> 01:49:12.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:14.750 --> 01:49:14.760 align:start position:0%
okay so uh Chris was thinking that
 
01:49:16.850 --> 01:49:16.860 align:start position:0%
because now we've figured out what was
 
01:49:17.990 --> 01:49:18.000 align:start position:0%
the difference because that was our
 
01:49:19.669 --> 01:49:19.679 align:start position:0%
question there why was there a
 
01:49:21.169 --> 01:49:21.179 align:start position:0%
difference in the numbers and now we
 
01:49:22.910 --> 01:49:22.920 align:start position:0%
figured it out it was just a kind of
 
01:49:24.830 --> 01:49:24.840 align:start position:0%
tabulation error
 
01:49:24.840 --> 01:49:27.229 align:start position:0%
tabulation error
okay

01:49:27.229 --> 01:49:27.239 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:49:29.390 --> 01:49:29.400 align:start position:0%
and then uh
 
01:49:32.149 --> 01:49:32.159 align:start position:0%
it goes up and down slightly from there
 
01:49:37.970 --> 01:49:37.980 align:start position:0%
in 2024 and 2025 on your worksheet
 
01:49:39.830 --> 01:49:39.840 align:start position:0%
and that up and down is mainly driven by
 
01:49:41.629 --> 01:49:41.639 align:start position:0%
if you look at the interest Revenue it
 
01:49:44.390 --> 01:49:44.400 align:start position:0%
goes up and then it's 35 31 and then
 
01:49:47.149 --> 01:49:47.159 align:start position:0%
down to 24.
 
01:49:49.970 --> 01:49:49.980 align:start position:0%
are you looking for uh this might be a
 
01:49:51.410 --> 01:49:51.420 align:start position:0%
nice time to make a motion for straw
 
01:49:51.420 --> 01:49:56.090 align:start position:0%
nice time to make a motion for straw
vote

01:49:56.090 --> 01:49:56.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:57.729 --> 01:49:57.739 align:start position:0%
or other
 
01:50:03.950 --> 01:50:03.960 align:start position:0%
97 million for FY 23 99 million for 24
 
01:50:03.960 --> 01:50:06.729 align:start position:0%
97 million for FY 23 99 million for 24
and

01:50:06.729 --> 01:50:06.739 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:50:09.050 --> 01:50:09.060 align:start position:0%
94.6 for
 
01:50:09.060 --> 01:50:11.149 align:start position:0%
94.6 for
25

01:50:11.149 --> 01:50:11.159 align:start position:0%
25
 
01:50:13.430 --> 01:50:13.440 align:start position:0%
. is there a second representative what
 
01:50:16.910 --> 01:50:16.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:20.390 --> 01:50:20.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:22.550 --> 01:50:22.560 align:start position:0%
any more questions
 
01:50:24.169 --> 01:50:24.179 align:start position:0%
all those in favor oh there's a question
 
01:50:26.870 --> 01:50:26.880 align:start position:0%
representative Phyllis yeah so
 
01:50:28.090 --> 01:50:28.100 align:start position:0%
I understand
 
01:50:33.290 --> 01:50:33.300 align:start position:0%
the the change for the um 2023
 
01:50:39.050 --> 01:50:39.060 align:start position:0%
I'm don't understand why 24 would be
 
01:50:43.209 --> 01:50:43.219 align:start position:0%
higher when you look back at
 
01:50:50.629 --> 01:50:50.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:52.609 --> 01:50:52.619 align:start position:0%
and to that you add 31 million in
 
01:50:55.070 --> 01:50:55.080 align:start position:0%
interest they anticipate
 
01:50:55.080 --> 01:50:56.689 align:start position:0%
interest they anticipate
or

01:50:56.689 --> 01:50:56.699 align:start position:0%
or
 
01:50:58.189 --> 01:50:58.199 align:start position:0%
which year
 
01:51:00.050 --> 01:51:00.060 align:start position:0%
for 24.
 
01:51:01.550 --> 01:51:01.560 align:start position:0%
is that the number that's the number
 
01:51:03.290 --> 01:51:03.300 align:start position:0%
you're talking about
 
01:51:06.050 --> 01:51:06.060 align:start position:0%
okay so it's because interest rates are
 
01:51:09.350 --> 01:51:09.360 align:start position:0%
a lot higher than they have been uh the
 
01:51:10.669 --> 01:51:10.679 align:start position:0%
the reason that there's so much interest
 
01:51:12.830 --> 01:51:12.840 align:start position:0%
revenue is that the state is uh flush
 
01:51:14.870 --> 01:51:14.880 align:start position:0%
with cash right now and the treasurer is
 
01:51:17.450 --> 01:51:17.460 align:start position:0%
investing that to get a return so that
 
01:51:19.070 --> 01:51:19.080 align:start position:0%
interest is coming to the state as well
 
01:51:21.169 --> 01:51:21.179 align:start position:0%
with also a higher rate than there than
 
01:51:24.709 --> 01:51:24.719 align:start position:0%
there was two or three years ago partly
 
01:51:27.189 --> 01:51:27.199 align:start position:0%
yes yeah okay I'm good
 
01:51:30.590 --> 01:51:30.600 align:start position:0%
okay any more discussion all those in
 
01:51:32.030 --> 01:51:32.040 align:start position:0%
favor of that motion you want to raise
 
01:51:37.790 --> 01:51:37.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:39.530 --> 01:51:39.540 align:start position:0%
okay it looks like unanimous I don't
 
01:51:41.090 --> 01:51:41.100 align:start position:0%
know what the number is count the number
 
01:51:43.209 --> 01:51:43.219 align:start position:0%
for me I think it's 16 is that it
 
01:51:46.790 --> 01:51:46.800 align:start position:0%
okay so stravo looks like we've got that
 
01:51:56.629 --> 01:51:56.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:59.270 --> 01:51:59.280 align:start position:0%
I'm Adam chair defending
 
01:52:01.430 --> 01:52:01.440 align:start position:0%
representative Southworth um can we do
 
01:52:04.250 --> 01:52:04.260 align:start position:0%
Lottery since we just heard from them
 
01:52:07.129 --> 01:52:07.139 align:start position:0%
15. okay so we have 15 people here today
 
01:52:11.450 --> 01:52:11.460 align:start position:0%
and so uh we could I well sure we could
 
01:52:12.649 --> 01:52:12.659 align:start position:0%
try talking about Lottery what do we
 
01:52:12.659 --> 01:52:13.430 align:start position:0%
try talking about Lottery what do we
think

01:52:13.430 --> 01:52:13.440 align:start position:0%
think
 
01:52:17.290 --> 01:52:17.300 align:start position:0%
wanna what are the odds
 
01:52:20.570 --> 01:52:20.580 align:start position:0%
Madam chair representative I have no
 
01:52:22.370 --> 01:52:22.380 align:start position:0%
reason to dispute
 
01:52:25.669 --> 01:52:25.679 align:start position:0%
uh the agency with respect to these
 
01:52:28.430 --> 01:52:28.440 align:start position:0%
numbers so I would move a straw number
 
01:52:31.129 --> 01:52:31.139 align:start position:0%
for 23 of 170.8
 
01:52:35.930 --> 01:52:35.940 align:start position:0%
uh 158 for 24 and 163 for 25.
 
01:52:38.209 --> 01:52:38.219 align:start position:0%
is there a second
 
01:52:40.790 --> 01:52:40.800 align:start position:0%
okay I'm representative Rose Schertz
 
01:52:43.910 --> 01:52:43.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:46.729 --> 01:52:46.739 align:start position:0%
all right anyone have some discussion on
 
01:52:46.739 --> 01:52:49.550 align:start position:0%
all right anyone have some discussion on
that

01:52:49.550 --> 01:52:49.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:52.070 --> 01:52:52.080 align:start position:0%
representative fellows I I would just
 
01:52:55.070 --> 01:52:55.080 align:start position:0%
agree with the motion because there are
 
01:52:57.129 --> 01:52:57.139 align:start position:0%
so many different pieces to the lottery
 
01:52:59.870 --> 01:52:59.880 align:start position:0%
and so many
 
01:52:59.880 --> 01:53:01.149 align:start position:0%
and so many
um

01:53:01.149 --> 01:53:01.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:53:04.010 --> 01:53:04.020 align:start position:0%
variables that are going to affect it
 
01:53:06.290 --> 01:53:06.300 align:start position:0%
going forward I think that the Lottery
 
01:53:10.070 --> 01:53:10.080 align:start position:0%
Commission is just the the is you know
 
01:53:11.990 --> 01:53:12.000 align:start position:0%
can come up with any better estimate
 
01:53:17.270 --> 01:53:17.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:21.229 --> 01:53:21.239 align:start position:0%
anyone else okay uh nope no other hands
 
01:53:24.050 --> 01:53:24.060 align:start position:0%
all those in favor of the motion please
 
01:53:26.149 --> 01:53:26.159 align:start position:0%
raise your hand
 
01:53:29.390 --> 01:53:29.400 align:start position:0%
looks like everyone thank you okay so
 
01:53:29.400 --> 01:53:34.070 align:start position:0%
looks like everyone thank you okay so
15-0

01:53:34.070 --> 01:53:34.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:37.550 --> 01:53:37.560 align:start position:0%
it's nice to get the easier stuff done
 
01:53:39.830 --> 01:53:39.840 align:start position:0%
uh anything else you'd like to bring to
 
01:53:44.510 --> 01:53:44.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:47.390 --> 01:53:47.400 align:start position:0%
I mean I don't there's liquor if anybody
 
01:53:50.629 --> 01:53:50.639 align:start position:0%
would like to maybe approach liquor I
 
01:53:51.890 --> 01:53:51.900 align:start position:0%
think you were waiting on the governor
 
01:53:54.169 --> 01:53:54.179 align:start position:0%
to explain the governor's office to
 
01:53:57.290 --> 01:53:57.300 align:start position:0%
explain why in 23 they they had 135 and
 
01:53:59.870 --> 01:53:59.880 align:start position:0%
that um
 
01:54:03.229 --> 01:54:03.239 align:start position:0%
um liquor had 130 in
 
01:54:05.510 --> 01:54:05.520 align:start position:0%
but if it's more discussion maybe you
 
01:54:07.669 --> 01:54:07.679 align:start position:0%
want to go to lunch and come back after
 
01:54:09.530 --> 01:54:09.540 align:start position:0%
and do some of this
 
01:54:11.629 --> 01:54:11.639 align:start position:0%
okay I just heard representative fellows
 
01:54:12.830 --> 01:54:12.840 align:start position:0%
you're thinking that we wait till after
 
01:54:14.209 --> 01:54:14.219 align:start position:0%
lunch and kind of mull that one over
 
01:54:14.219 --> 01:54:15.770 align:start position:0%
lunch and kind of mull that one over
okay

01:54:15.770 --> 01:54:15.780 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:54:20.209 --> 01:54:20.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:23.209 --> 01:54:23.219 align:start position:0%
uh could we just do um cue the Medicaid
 
01:54:23.219 --> 01:54:27.050 align:start position:0%
uh could we just do um cue the Medicaid
recoveries

01:54:27.050 --> 01:54:27.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:27.060 --> 01:54:30.169 align:start position:0%
 
phew

01:54:30.169 --> 01:54:30.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:33.410 --> 01:54:33.420 align:start position:0%
I think we did that yeah so and in the
 
01:54:33.420 --> 01:54:34.609 align:start position:0%
I think we did that yeah so and in the
document

01:54:34.609 --> 01:54:34.619 align:start position:0%
document
 
01:54:37.129 --> 01:54:37.139 align:start position:0%
hopefully you have shades
 
01:54:38.570 --> 01:54:38.580 align:start position:0%
it would show that that's where you
 
01:54:40.790 --> 01:54:40.800 align:start position:0%
tentatively had some agreements um the
 
01:54:43.250 --> 01:54:43.260 align:start position:0%
other day yeah but
 
01:54:45.790 --> 01:54:45.800 align:start position:0%
if you need to revisit it that's as well
 
01:54:48.830 --> 01:54:48.840 align:start position:0%
representative putt we do oh utility
 
01:54:51.350 --> 01:54:51.360 align:start position:0%
property tax
 
01:54:54.229 --> 01:54:54.239 align:start position:0%
I want to hold off on that one I have
 
01:54:56.330 --> 01:54:56.340 align:start position:0%
lots more thinking to do I thought I
 
01:54:57.950 --> 01:54:57.960 align:start position:0%
understood that one and now I've got to
 
01:55:00.050 --> 01:55:00.060 align:start position:0%
rethink it a little bit
 
01:55:01.790 --> 01:55:01.800 align:start position:0%
if you don't mind
 
01:55:10.850 --> 01:55:10.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:14.209 --> 01:55:14.219 align:start position:0%
G Communications tax we have to show a
 
01:55:17.149 --> 01:55:17.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:29.149 --> 01:55:29.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:31.729 --> 01:55:31.739 align:start position:0%
right because we we have to assume that
 
01:55:34.790 --> 01:55:34.800 align:start position:0%
the current law right correct right so
 
01:55:34.800 --> 01:55:35.930 align:start position:0%
the current law right correct right so
uh

01:55:35.930 --> 01:55:35.940 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:55:39.950 --> 01:55:39.960 align:start position:0%
we have an agency low estimate of 28.8
 
01:55:44.030 --> 01:55:44.040 align:start position:0%
agency High estimate of 29.9 not too far
 
01:55:46.370 --> 01:55:46.380 align:start position:0%
off for 2023
 
01:55:48.770 --> 01:55:48.780 align:start position:0%
then the range when I look at the the
 
01:55:53.350 --> 01:55:53.360 align:start position:0%
details goes from 27.9 to 29.9 roughly
 
01:55:56.750 --> 01:55:56.760 align:start position:0%
my own calculations so and I moved the
 
01:55:59.510 --> 01:55:59.520 align:start position:0%
governor's estimate 28.9 for all three
 
01:55:59.520 --> 01:56:05.330 align:start position:0%
governor's estimate 28.9 for all three
years

01:56:05.330 --> 01:56:05.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:07.609 --> 01:56:07.619 align:start position:0%
so you don't think it will go down in
 
01:56:08.750 --> 01:56:08.760 align:start position:0%
the next two years I'm guess I'm going
 
01:56:10.790 --> 01:56:10.800 align:start position:0%
to throw that out there
 
01:56:14.270 --> 01:56:14.280 align:start position:0%
maybe but it's it's going down to the
 
01:56:17.149 --> 01:56:17.159 align:start position:0%
infinite slow rate now
 
01:56:19.970 --> 01:56:19.980 align:start position:0%
so it it I don't think the change if we
 
01:56:21.590 --> 01:56:21.600 align:start position:0%
reflected would amount anything in the
 
01:56:24.709 --> 01:56:24.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:26.209 --> 01:56:26.219 align:start position:0%
representative all mean then
 
01:56:29.030 --> 01:56:29.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:31.070 --> 01:56:31.080 align:start position:0%
um I think for the small numbers when
 
01:56:33.109 --> 01:56:33.119 align:start position:0%
they're when they are
 
01:56:36.290 --> 01:56:36.300 align:start position:0%
going down then they are very likely to
 
01:56:38.689 --> 01:56:38.699 align:start position:0%
continue going down if it's not repealed
 
01:56:42.109 --> 01:56:42.119 align:start position:0%
on then it's better to reflect them and
 
01:56:42.119 --> 01:56:43.609 align:start position:0%
on then it's better to reflect them and
I

01:56:43.609 --> 01:56:43.619 align:start position:0%
I
 
01:56:46.129 --> 01:56:46.139 align:start position:0%
I think I'm I've been trying to find it
 
01:56:49.629 --> 01:56:49.639 align:start position:0%
but I think that last year we came in at
 
01:56:53.090 --> 01:56:53.100 align:start position:0%
28.9 or something like that so we
 
01:56:53.100 --> 01:56:54.169 align:start position:0%
28.9 or something like that so we
shouldn't

01:56:54.169 --> 01:56:54.179 align:start position:0%
shouldn't
 
01:56:57.169 --> 01:56:57.179 align:start position:0%
go below go above the
 
01:56:59.810 --> 01:56:59.820 align:start position:0%
the numbers that they
 
01:57:05.390 --> 01:57:05.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:10.910 --> 01:57:10.920 align:start position:0%
okay other comments on CST okay so the
 
01:57:12.669 --> 01:57:12.679 align:start position:0%
motion is to use
 
01:57:15.830 --> 01:57:15.840 align:start position:0%
28.9 for all three years just want to
 
01:57:18.350 --> 01:57:18.360 align:start position:0%
make sure I got that right
 
01:57:19.970 --> 01:57:19.980 align:start position:0%
any other comments
 
01:57:22.010 --> 01:57:22.020 align:start position:0%
representative fellows
 
01:57:28.850 --> 01:57:28.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:31.189 --> 01:57:31.199 align:start position:0%
Governor's estimate is in between the
 
01:57:37.609 --> 01:57:37.619 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:37.619 --> 01:57:38.750 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:57:38.750 --> 01:57:38.760 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:57:42.290 --> 01:57:42.300 align:start position:0%
any other comments okay all those in
 
01:57:44.330 --> 01:57:44.340 align:start position:0%
favor for the Straub whole vote raise
 
01:57:47.450 --> 01:57:47.460 align:start position:0%
your hand of that motion
 
01:57:49.609 --> 01:57:49.619 align:start position:0%
okay looks unanimous
 
01:57:54.290 --> 01:57:54.300 align:start position:0%
nope no I apologize so 14 to 1.
 
01:57:57.169 --> 01:57:57.179 align:start position:0%
is that correct okay great
 
01:57:59.930 --> 01:57:59.940 align:start position:0%
all right again we can go back and visit
 
01:58:01.189 --> 01:58:01.199 align:start position:0%
these if we really need to
 
01:58:03.169 --> 01:58:03.179 align:start position:0%
representative orrs
 
01:58:05.390 --> 01:58:05.400 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair I I think uh
 
01:58:07.370 --> 01:58:07.380 align:start position:0%
representative Albany has a good point
 
01:58:08.870 --> 01:58:08.880 align:start position:0%
just for the record
 
01:58:08.880 --> 01:58:10.609 align:start position:0%
just for the record
absolutely

01:58:10.609 --> 01:58:10.619 align:start position:0%
absolutely
 
01:58:12.709 --> 01:58:12.719 align:start position:0%
every Point here is good
 
01:58:15.410 --> 01:58:15.420 align:start position:0%
except for mine
 
01:58:19.250 --> 01:58:19.260 align:start position:0%
okay all right let's stop now
 
01:58:21.890 --> 01:58:21.900 align:start position:0%
and come back at one and oh
 
01:58:23.089 --> 01:58:23.099 align:start position:0%
representative is there something over
 
01:58:32.350 --> 01:58:32.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:36.350 --> 01:58:36.360 align:start position:0%
we have a presentation tomorrow uh there
 
01:58:39.290 --> 01:58:39.300 align:start position:0%
was a request for more detail on the
 
01:58:42.530 --> 01:58:42.540 align:start position:0%
insurance and we do have a meeting at 11
 
01:58:44.570 --> 01:58:44.580 align:start position:0%
tomorrow on that and more information
 
01:58:48.050 --> 01:58:48.060 align:start position:0%
forthcoming we can certainly
 
01:58:50.209 --> 01:58:50.219 align:start position:0%
take that up today if we want but we
 
01:58:52.550 --> 01:58:52.560 align:start position:0%
might want to wait to get that Intel
 
01:58:54.830 --> 01:58:54.840 align:start position:0%
representative Olney
 
01:58:59.030 --> 01:58:59.040 align:start position:0%
was my request because in the past they
 
01:59:01.669 --> 01:59:01.679 align:start position:0%
have given us information on what parts
 
01:59:03.129 --> 01:59:03.139 align:start position:0%
of the insurance
 
01:59:08.570 --> 01:59:08.580 align:start position:0%
were on soft markets meaning that they
 
01:59:10.550 --> 01:59:10.560 align:start position:0%
couldn't charge as much for the
 
01:59:14.510 --> 01:59:14.520 align:start position:0%
insurance as they had done versus hard
 
01:59:17.390 --> 01:59:17.400 align:start position:0%
markets which was that they could charge
 
01:59:19.390 --> 01:59:19.400 align:start position:0%
the Earth
 
01:59:24.229 --> 01:59:24.239 align:start position:0%
and on I I didn't we do have a new
 
01:59:25.970 --> 01:59:25.980 align:start position:0%
insurance department
 
01:59:29.209 --> 01:59:29.219 align:start position:0%
this is the first time there hasn't been
 
01:59:31.729 --> 01:59:31.739 align:start position:0%
the woman that was always doing the
 
01:59:34.669 --> 01:59:34.679 align:start position:0%
calculations and I just wanted to be
 
01:59:39.410 --> 01:59:39.420 align:start position:0%
reassured that they are doing those
 
01:59:41.270 --> 01:59:41.280 align:start position:0%
yes and that's why we've requested them
 
01:59:43.430 --> 01:59:43.440 align:start position:0%
to come back based on your requests find
 
01:59:45.770 --> 01:59:45.780 align:start position:0%
out what they actually got
 
01:59:48.649 --> 01:59:48.659 align:start position:0%
at the end of March
 
01:59:54.129 --> 01:59:54.139 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:57.109 --> 01:59:57.119 align:start position:0%
just in brief Norma retired that's why
 
02:00:00.589 --> 02:00:00.599 align:start position:0%
you didn't see her again Amy duhame has
 
02:00:02.930 --> 02:00:02.940 align:start position:0%
taken over her position
 
02:00:06.530 --> 02:00:06.540 align:start position:0%
um but Amy and and uh uh DJ Bettencourt
 
02:00:08.390 --> 02:00:08.400 align:start position:0%
will be here tomorrow to talk to you and
 
02:00:10.609 --> 02:00:10.619 align:start position:0%
try to address your questions or any
 
02:00:11.870 --> 02:00:11.880 align:start position:0%
other that the committee might have as
 
02:00:14.510 --> 02:00:14.520 align:start position:0%
it relates to the revenue uh collected
 
02:00:16.970 --> 02:00:16.980 align:start position:0%
by the department would it be possible
 
02:00:19.370 --> 02:00:19.380 align:start position:0%
if they have their presentation already
 
02:00:21.530 --> 02:00:21.540 align:start position:0%
done and they could email it to us today
 
02:00:24.050 --> 02:00:24.060 align:start position:0%
that way we could look at it and be more
 
02:00:26.689 --> 02:00:26.699 align:start position:0%
prepared for tomorrow is that any chance
 
02:00:28.550 --> 02:00:28.560 align:start position:0%
um if I get it yep and I'll reach out to
 
02:00:29.689 --> 02:00:29.699 align:start position:0%
him again that's what I've been trying
 
02:00:31.669 --> 02:00:31.679 align:start position:0%
to do with all these presentations
 
02:00:34.430 --> 02:00:34.440 align:start position:0%
um but it's not working out that way
 
02:00:36.649 --> 02:00:36.659 align:start position:0%
well we understand how busy they are but
 
02:00:38.330 --> 02:00:38.340 align:start position:0%
that helps us kind of think about things
 
02:00:39.830 --> 02:00:39.840 align:start position:0%
a little bit more prepared with
 
02:00:42.410 --> 02:00:42.420 align:start position:0%
questions understood yeah okay okay
 
02:00:44.030 --> 02:00:44.040 align:start position:0%
great we'll see you back here at one
 
02:00:44.040 --> 03:13:59.630 align:start position:0%
great we'll see you back here at one
o'clock

03:13:59.630 --> 03:13:59.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:02.269 --> 03:14:02.279 align:start position:0%
sorry I'm late let's go ahead and get
 
03:14:06.230 --> 03:14:06.240 align:start position:0%
started again this is our time to
 
03:14:08.330 --> 03:14:08.340 align:start position:0%
talk about start talking about some of
 
03:14:11.269 --> 03:14:11.279 align:start position:0%
the tougher categories and seeing if we
 
03:14:13.910 --> 03:14:13.920 align:start position:0%
can get to consensus on any of them
 
03:14:16.309 --> 03:14:16.319 align:start position:0%
we have folks from the dra thank you
 
03:14:19.250 --> 03:14:19.260 align:start position:0%
back with us to help us oh they're
 
03:14:20.630 --> 03:14:20.640 align:start position:0%
spread out
 
03:14:20.640 --> 03:14:21.769 align:start position:0%
spread out
um

03:14:21.769 --> 03:14:21.779 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:14:25.309 --> 03:14:25.319 align:start position:0%
and a reminder that tomorrow we have a
 
03:14:26.690 --> 03:14:26.700 align:start position:0%
presentation from the insurance
 
03:14:29.570 --> 03:14:29.580 align:start position:0%
department as well as Employment
 
03:14:33.530 --> 03:14:33.540 align:start position:0%
Security on the employment world
 
03:14:33.540 --> 03:14:35.990 align:start position:0%
Security on the employment world
so

03:14:35.990 --> 03:14:36.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:14:36.000 --> 03:14:37.910 align:start position:0%
so
yes

03:14:37.910 --> 03:14:37.920 align:start position:0%
yes
 
03:14:42.710 --> 03:14:42.720 align:start position:0%
so do we write up a report when we the
 
03:14:44.269 --> 03:14:44.279 align:start position:0%
the bill there's a bill that's going to
 
03:14:46.730 --> 03:14:46.740 align:start position:0%
be the budget does it have a bill number
 
03:14:50.210 --> 03:14:50.220 align:start position:0%
so the budget is composed of houses I'm
 
03:14:52.190 --> 03:14:52.200 align:start position:0%
sorry our Revenue estimates no we will
 
03:14:54.230 --> 03:14:54.240 align:start position:0%
do what's called a resolution well it's
 
03:14:55.670 --> 03:14:55.680 align:start position:0%
a house resolution it is I guess it is
 
03:15:02.330 --> 03:15:02.340 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:04.429 --> 03:15:04.439 align:start position:0%
it's a resolution which will become an
 
03:15:06.469 --> 03:15:06.479 align:start position:0%
amendment or part of the house does it
 
03:15:08.570 --> 03:15:08.580 align:start position:0%
get a report that goes with it the same
 
03:15:10.610 --> 03:15:10.620 align:start position:0%
way a bill does
 
03:15:12.349 --> 03:15:12.359 align:start position:0%
Chris do you want to talk to this a
 
03:15:17.330 --> 03:15:17.340 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:19.550 --> 03:15:19.560 align:start position:0%
so typically the resolution is
 
03:15:22.730 --> 03:15:22.740 align:start position:0%
introduced on the day of a session and
 
03:15:23.990 --> 03:15:24.000 align:start position:0%
members from the Ways and Means
 
03:15:25.309 --> 03:15:25.319 align:start position:0%
Committee will present that resolution
 
03:15:27.710 --> 03:15:27.720 align:start position:0%
to the full body
 
03:15:29.510 --> 03:15:29.520 align:start position:0%
um what's happened the last few times is
 
03:15:31.490 --> 03:15:31.500 align:start position:0%
there's a vote taken the bodies accepted
 
03:15:34.790 --> 03:15:34.800 align:start position:0%
the revenues and then they are tabled so
 
03:15:36.950 --> 03:15:36.960 align:start position:0%
that resolution gets tabled
 
03:15:40.370 --> 03:15:40.380 align:start position:0%
Because the actual unrestricted revenues
 
03:15:43.070 --> 03:15:43.080 align:start position:0%
will be included in house bill one
 
03:15:44.750 --> 03:15:44.760 align:start position:0%
so that that bill will carry the
 
03:15:46.849 --> 03:15:46.859 align:start position:0%
revenues across basically what the Ways
 
03:15:48.469 --> 03:15:48.479 align:start position:0%
and Means Committee is doing with its
 
03:15:50.809 --> 03:15:50.819 align:start position:0%
resolution is letting the rest of the
 
03:15:52.550 --> 03:15:52.560 align:start position:0%
body know you've come to do a decision
 
03:15:54.530 --> 03:15:54.540 align:start position:0%
on what you believe the revenue should
 
03:15:57.170 --> 03:15:57.180 align:start position:0%
be in house bill one
 
03:16:01.550 --> 03:16:01.560 align:start position:0%
in general let me just so we would we
 
03:16:03.769 --> 03:16:03.779 align:start position:0%
would write our own committee blurb so I
 
03:16:06.650 --> 03:16:06.660 align:start position:0%
would write that open to edits and input
 
03:16:06.660 --> 03:16:08.269 align:start position:0%
would write that open to edits and input
obviously

03:16:08.269 --> 03:16:08.279 align:start position:0%
obviously
 
03:16:10.370 --> 03:16:10.380 align:start position:0%
I'm gonna say it's just what the
 
03:16:12.170 --> 03:16:12.180 align:start position:0%
resolution just to clarify it's just
 
03:16:15.650 --> 03:16:15.660 align:start position:0%
numbers it's a chart with numbers in it
 
03:16:18.469 --> 03:16:18.479 align:start position:0%
it's not it's not language at least
 
03:16:21.370 --> 03:16:21.380 align:start position:0%
unless there's some qualifier in there
 
03:16:23.630 --> 03:16:23.640 align:start position:0%
that's exactly right it's basically
 
03:16:25.730 --> 03:16:25.740 align:start position:0%
there's I think four or five lines that
 
03:16:27.530 --> 03:16:27.540 align:start position:0%
lead into the actual numbers basically
 
03:16:30.790 --> 03:16:30.800 align:start position:0%
saying this is to restate the 23 24 25
 
03:16:33.290 --> 03:16:33.300 align:start position:0%
unrestricted revenues
 
03:16:36.170 --> 03:16:36.180 align:start position:0%
um you'll have a column that is the
 
03:16:39.050 --> 03:16:39.060 align:start position:0%
planned revenues for 23 and then there
 
03:16:40.610 --> 03:16:40.620 align:start position:0%
will be what the committee believes the
 
03:16:42.530 --> 03:16:42.540 align:start position:0%
23 Revenue estimates should be as well
 
03:16:45.769 --> 03:16:45.779 align:start position:0%
as 24 and 25. if you recall on the day
 
03:16:48.170 --> 03:16:48.180 align:start position:0%
that I presented to you in the LBA
 
03:16:50.389 --> 03:16:50.399 align:start position:0%
document if you look at that there's
 
03:16:52.190 --> 03:16:52.200 align:start position:0%
house resolution 11 that's the
 
03:16:54.530 --> 03:16:54.540 align:start position:0%
resolution that was submitted
 
03:16:56.990 --> 03:16:57.000 align:start position:0%
um the last budget cycle and that gives
 
03:16:58.610 --> 03:16:58.620 align:start position:0%
you the framework that would be used for
 
03:17:00.530 --> 03:17:00.540 align:start position:0%
your resolution that you would come up
 
03:17:03.410 --> 03:17:03.420 align:start position:0%
for this session based on your decisions
 
03:17:05.630 --> 03:17:05.640 align:start position:0%
here the next couple of days
 
03:17:07.370 --> 03:17:07.380 align:start position:0%
representative Army
 
03:17:11.510 --> 03:17:11.520 align:start position:0%
yes and what would be the blurb is the
 
03:17:14.750 --> 03:17:14.760 align:start position:0%
statement uh spoken or read on the floor
 
03:17:18.290 --> 03:17:18.300 align:start position:0%
by the chair usually which
 
03:17:18.300 --> 03:17:19.010 align:start position:0%
by the chair usually which
um

03:17:19.010 --> 03:17:19.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:17:21.889 --> 03:17:21.899 align:start position:0%
which explains things that they think
 
03:17:23.750 --> 03:17:23.760 align:start position:0%
people would might want to ask questions
 
03:17:27.010 --> 03:17:27.020 align:start position:0%
about and then people may ask questions
 
03:17:29.570 --> 03:17:29.580 align:start position:0%
after that about something that wasn't
 
03:17:32.269 --> 03:17:32.279 align:start position:0%
covered or they didn't understand and
 
03:17:36.110 --> 03:17:36.120 align:start position:0%
that has never been motioned into the
 
03:17:37.429 --> 03:17:37.439 align:start position:0%
official record
 
03:17:41.150 --> 03:17:41.160 align:start position:0%
so we have no records of what
 
03:17:45.950 --> 03:17:45.960 align:start position:0%
uh and nor major and other people said
 
03:17:47.570 --> 03:17:47.580 align:start position:0%
yeah and that's that's fine again
 
03:17:49.010 --> 03:17:49.020 align:start position:0%
because we know what we're doing is
 
03:17:51.230 --> 03:17:51.240 align:start position:0%
estimates we're and it's we're doing it
 
03:17:53.269 --> 03:17:53.279 align:start position:0%
at a point of time with the best
 
03:17:55.309 --> 03:17:55.319 align:start position:0%
information that we have and we may go
 
03:17:57.050 --> 03:17:57.060 align:start position:0%
back and do it again
 
03:17:58.790 --> 03:17:58.800 align:start position:0%
we might be asked to do it again because
 
03:18:02.330 --> 03:18:02.340 align:start position:0%
in April the world may be changed for
 
03:18:04.190 --> 03:18:04.200 align:start position:0%
all we know was there any other hand
 
03:18:06.290 --> 03:18:06.300 align:start position:0%
over here
 
03:18:08.570 --> 03:18:08.580 align:start position:0%
okay uh
 
03:18:11.510 --> 03:18:11.520 align:start position:0%
do we want to start looking at another
 
03:18:13.370 --> 03:18:13.380 align:start position:0%
Revenue item
 
03:18:15.290 --> 03:18:15.300 align:start position:0%
if I might I would encourage you to have
 
03:18:18.590 --> 03:18:18.600 align:start position:0%
dra come up and look at maybe those
 
03:18:21.110 --> 03:18:21.120 align:start position:0%
revenues that they deal with so that if
 
03:18:22.990 --> 03:18:23.000 align:start position:0%
there's questions that you have you can
 
03:18:25.429 --> 03:18:25.439 align:start position:0%
ask them that and once you're done with
 
03:18:27.290 --> 03:18:27.300 align:start position:0%
dra today then maybe we could look at
 
03:18:29.210 --> 03:18:29.220 align:start position:0%
the highway fund revenues
 
03:18:32.210 --> 03:18:32.220 align:start position:0%
because I think uh director Gary
 
03:18:33.889 --> 03:18:33.899 align:start position:0%
answered some questions related to that
 
03:18:36.349 --> 03:18:36.359 align:start position:0%
but other than that I I would really
 
03:18:41.330 --> 03:18:41.340 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:45.290 --> 03:18:45.300 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:45.300 --> 03:18:53.030 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

03:18:53.030 --> 03:18:53.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:54.889 --> 03:18:54.899 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Madam chair members of
 
03:18:56.090 --> 03:18:56.100 align:start position:0%
the committee Lindsey stepp commissioner
 
03:18:57.290 --> 03:18:57.300 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Department of Revenue
 
03:19:00.950 --> 03:19:00.960 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions I will
 
03:19:05.030 --> 03:19:05.040 align:start position:0%
note you have in front of you copies of
 
03:19:07.610 --> 03:19:07.620 align:start position:0%
three emails that have been sent out
 
03:19:09.710 --> 03:19:09.720 align:start position:0%
over the past few weeks one of which was
 
03:19:11.450 --> 03:19:11.460 align:start position:0%
this morning so you may not have seen it
 
03:19:11.460 --> 03:19:12.950 align:start position:0%
this morning so you may not have seen it
yet

03:19:12.950 --> 03:19:12.960 align:start position:0%
yet
 
03:19:14.389 --> 03:19:14.399 align:start position:0%
um but you all have that in your email
 
03:19:16.490 --> 03:19:16.500 align:start position:0%
but we wanted to provide hard copies as
 
03:19:19.550 --> 03:19:19.560 align:start position:0%
well those are answers to I think at
 
03:19:21.230 --> 03:19:21.240 align:start position:0%
this point most if not all of the
 
03:19:24.590 --> 03:19:24.600 align:start position:0%
questions that we have received up into
 
03:19:26.210 --> 03:19:26.220 align:start position:0%
this point
 
03:19:28.910 --> 03:19:28.920 align:start position:0%
so just wanted to be thorough and make
 
03:19:30.769 --> 03:19:30.779 align:start position:0%
sure everyone had a copy of those we're
 
03:19:32.389 --> 03:19:32.399 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions related to
 
03:19:34.969 --> 03:19:34.979 align:start position:0%
those as well representative Platt I'd
 
03:19:36.530 --> 03:19:36.540 align:start position:0%
just like to say thank you for the work
 
03:19:38.929 --> 03:19:38.939 align:start position:0%
you did on real estate transfer tax
 
03:19:40.910 --> 03:19:40.920 align:start position:0%
during previous recessionary years
 
03:19:43.730 --> 03:19:43.740 align:start position:0%
adjusted for today's prices it gives me
 
03:19:46.730 --> 03:19:46.740 align:start position:0%
some idea what we might expect going
 
03:19:48.410 --> 03:19:48.420 align:start position:0%
into what I believe to be a recession
 
03:19:50.630 --> 03:19:50.640 align:start position:0%
sure you're very welcome that was Lauren
 
03:19:52.670 --> 03:19:52.680 align:start position:0%
and Keen that did that work what
 
03:19:54.050 --> 03:19:54.060 align:start position:0%
representative plett's referring to is
 
03:19:57.170 --> 03:19:57.180 align:start position:0%
in your packet he had asked for kind of
 
03:19:59.389 --> 03:19:59.399 align:start position:0%
a history of real estate transfer tax
 
03:20:01.969 --> 03:20:01.979 align:start position:0%
during recessions so what we did is we
 
03:20:03.530 --> 03:20:03.540 align:start position:0%
took the history of the real estate
 
03:20:06.290 --> 03:20:06.300 align:start position:0%
transfer tax we essentially normalized
 
03:20:08.330 --> 03:20:08.340 align:start position:0%
it to today's rate because there's been
 
03:20:09.889 --> 03:20:09.899 align:start position:0%
numerous rate changes over the history
 
03:20:11.750 --> 03:20:11.760 align:start position:0%
of the tax so it's essentially using the
 
03:20:14.210 --> 03:20:14.220 align:start position:0%
current rate and then we adjusted the
 
03:20:16.730 --> 03:20:16.740 align:start position:0%
revenue based based on the change in the
 
03:20:19.849 --> 03:20:19.859 align:start position:0%
median home sales price over the time
 
03:20:21.590 --> 03:20:21.600 align:start position:0%
period as well so we've essentially
 
03:20:24.290 --> 03:20:24.300 align:start position:0%
brought historic Rhett to the current
 
03:20:27.530 --> 03:20:27.540 align:start position:0%
rate and to today's home price and then
 
03:20:29.330 --> 03:20:29.340 align:start position:0%
highlighted for you where recessions
 
03:20:31.190 --> 03:20:31.200 align:start position:0%
have occurred and the reason or the
 
03:20:33.950 --> 03:20:33.960 align:start position:0%
cause if we had one for the recession so
 
03:20:35.330 --> 03:20:35.340 align:start position:0%
again giving you kind of a history of
 
03:20:37.610 --> 03:20:37.620 align:start position:0%
what happens to Rhett during a recession
 
03:20:51.370 --> 03:20:51.380 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:53.690 --> 03:20:53.700 align:start position:0%
representative all me
 
03:20:57.110 --> 03:20:57.120 align:start position:0%
I got a couple of things but one of them
 
03:21:03.050 --> 03:21:03.060 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:05.210 --> 03:21:05.220 align:start position:0%
um King's
 
03:21:05.220 --> 03:21:06.410 align:start position:0%
um King's
on

03:21:06.410 --> 03:21:06.420 align:start position:0%
on
 
03:21:09.050 --> 03:21:09.060 align:start position:0%
Rel replies to questions from revenue
 
03:21:11.330 --> 03:21:11.340 align:start position:0%
estimates percentages the one that gave
 
03:21:15.950 --> 03:21:15.960 align:start position:0%
us option 6A and 6B yes on
 
03:21:15.960 --> 03:21:18.110 align:start position:0%
us option 6A and 6B yes on
six

03:21:18.110 --> 03:21:18.120 align:start position:0%
six
 
03:21:18.120 --> 03:21:19.670 align:start position:0%
six
B

03:21:19.670 --> 03:21:19.680 align:start position:0%
B
 
03:21:22.610 --> 03:21:22.620 align:start position:0%
can be measured against the numbers you
 
03:21:24.769 --> 03:21:24.779 align:start position:0%
gave us for
 
03:21:24.779 --> 03:21:26.330 align:start position:0%
gave us for
um

03:21:26.330 --> 03:21:26.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:21:28.730 --> 03:21:28.740 align:start position:0%
for option five
 
03:21:31.309 --> 03:21:31.319 align:start position:0%
in in your presentation
 
03:21:35.690 --> 03:21:35.700 align:start position:0%
on but 6 a
 
03:21:38.630 --> 03:21:38.640 align:start position:0%
is against option
 
03:21:41.990 --> 03:21:42.000 align:start position:0%
four which you didn't use in your
 
03:21:43.610 --> 03:21:43.620 align:start position:0%
presentation so there's no way to
 
03:21:45.230 --> 03:21:45.240 align:start position:0%
Compare the numbers
 
03:21:50.990 --> 03:21:51.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:54.650 --> 03:21:54.660 align:start position:0%
So when you say that we didn't use I
 
03:21:57.410 --> 03:21:57.420 align:start position:0%
don't know that that's 100 True for
 
03:21:59.809 --> 03:21:59.819 align:start position:0%
every tax type the the options that we
 
03:22:02.269 --> 03:22:02.279 align:start position:0%
used in our presentation vary by tax
 
03:22:03.950 --> 03:22:03.960 align:start position:0%
type yes
 
03:22:06.190 --> 03:22:06.200 align:start position:0%
um sorry I'm talking about the business
 
03:22:08.330 --> 03:22:08.340 align:start position:0%
profits tax
 
03:22:10.550 --> 03:22:10.560 align:start position:0%
right I believe your question was in
 
03:22:12.530 --> 03:22:12.540 align:start position:0%
general if we could run the scenarios
 
03:22:14.570 --> 03:22:14.580 align:start position:0%
using those two options for all the
 
03:22:17.750 --> 03:22:17.760 align:start position:0%
taxes so that's what we did those
 
03:22:20.030 --> 03:22:20.040 align:start position:0%
scenarios may be more informative for
 
03:22:23.150 --> 03:22:23.160 align:start position:0%
some taxes versus other taxes depending
 
03:22:26.210 --> 03:22:26.220 align:start position:0%
on which scenarios we used in our
 
03:22:26.220 --> 03:22:27.410 align:start position:0%
on which scenarios we used in our
analysis

03:22:27.410 --> 03:22:27.420 align:start position:0%
analysis
 
03:22:32.269 --> 03:22:32.279 align:start position:0%
yes is is that did you send us all the
 
03:22:35.210 --> 03:22:35.220 align:start position:0%
options I didn't think so no you asked
 
03:22:37.790 --> 03:22:37.800 align:start position:0%
if we could also run those options so we
 
03:22:43.070 --> 03:22:43.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:45.950 --> 03:22:45.960 align:start position:0%
you asked for option 6A and 6B so that's
 
03:22:49.610 --> 03:22:49.620 align:start position:0%
what we ran and we sent you yes but on
 
03:22:52.969 --> 03:22:52.979 align:start position:0%
in your presentation where the you just
 
03:22:55.250 --> 03:22:55.260 align:start position:0%
show us the numbers for the low that you
 
03:22:57.590 --> 03:22:57.600 align:start position:0%
picked in the high that you correct and
 
03:23:01.750 --> 03:23:01.760 align:start position:0%
for that one you didn't pick the for the
 
03:23:06.130 --> 03:23:06.140 align:start position:0%
low the same one that was
 
03:23:10.370 --> 03:23:10.380 align:start position:0%
on that is 6a which is the one that I
 
03:23:12.229 --> 03:23:12.239 align:start position:0%
wanted to
 
03:23:14.929 --> 03:23:14.939 align:start position:0%
what had picked to look at so there's no
 
03:23:17.150 --> 03:23:17.160 align:start position:0%
way to tell the
 
03:23:19.670 --> 03:23:19.680 align:start position:0%
if there's any big difference between
 
03:23:22.010 --> 03:23:22.020 align:start position:0%
the numbers if you'd like we can give
 
03:23:24.650 --> 03:23:24.660 align:start position:0%
you all of the options we were trying to
 
03:23:27.950 --> 03:23:27.960 align:start position:0%
not overwhelm you with numbers so that's
 
03:23:30.290 --> 03:23:30.300 align:start position:0%
why we picked certain options for a high
 
03:23:31.729 --> 03:23:31.739 align:start position:0%
and a low if you'd like to see all of
 
03:23:34.490 --> 03:23:34.500 align:start position:0%
them you can but I just yeah didn't want
 
03:23:36.349 --> 03:23:36.359 align:start position:0%
to clutter everything with additional
 
03:23:38.809 --> 03:23:38.819 align:start position:0%
information it was just option four
 
03:23:38.819 --> 03:23:40.490 align:start position:0%
information it was just option four
though

03:23:40.490 --> 03:23:40.500 align:start position:0%
though
 
03:23:43.250 --> 03:23:43.260 align:start position:0%
the one that you you that I'd asked for
 
03:23:45.769 --> 03:23:45.779 align:start position:0%
for 6A there's no equivalent number
 
03:23:47.809 --> 03:23:47.819 align:start position:0%
anywhere if you give me one second I
 
03:23:51.349 --> 03:23:51.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:53.929 --> 03:23:53.939 align:start position:0%
sorry and what we're talking about is
 
03:23:56.389 --> 03:23:56.399 align:start position:0%
whether it makes a difference if you
 
03:23:59.450 --> 03:23:59.460 align:start position:0%
just look at the last three months of
 
03:24:03.530 --> 03:24:03.540 align:start position:0%
the year to date instead of five months
 
03:24:05.570 --> 03:24:05.580 align:start position:0%
to decide what's going to happen in the
 
03:24:05.580 --> 03:24:07.309 align:start position:0%
to decide what's going to happen in the
future

03:24:07.309 --> 03:24:07.319 align:start position:0%
future
 
03:24:24.910 --> 03:24:24.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:27.469 --> 03:24:27.479 align:start position:0%
so 6A
 
03:24:29.990 --> 03:24:30.000 align:start position:0%
is using
 
03:24:33.830 --> 03:24:33.840 align:start position:0%
actual from prior year year to year yeah
 
03:24:36.650 --> 03:24:36.660 align:start position:0%
and 6B is using plan
 
03:24:40.490 --> 03:24:40.500 align:start position:0%
right so 6A
 
03:24:45.290 --> 03:24:45.300 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:48.229 --> 03:24:48.239 align:start position:0%
with option five
 
03:24:51.650 --> 03:24:51.660 align:start position:0%
and six B I believe would correspond
 
03:24:56.090 --> 03:24:56.100 align:start position:0%
with option four no I was using uh and
 
03:24:59.750 --> 03:24:59.760 align:start position:0%
you've got it here as uh
 
03:25:01.550 --> 03:25:01.560 align:start position:0%
or are you using the list that was in
 
03:25:04.969 --> 03:25:04.979 align:start position:0%
change November to two Okay to January
 
03:25:08.269 --> 03:25:08.279 align:start position:0%
so sorry the year over year growth okay
 
03:25:10.550 --> 03:25:10.560 align:start position:0%
so the year over year growth
 
03:25:15.530 --> 03:25:15.540 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:15.540 --> 03:25:17.690 align:start position:0%
 
using

03:25:17.690 --> 03:25:17.700 align:start position:0%
using
 
03:25:20.469 --> 03:25:20.479 align:start position:0%
year to date
 
03:25:23.750 --> 03:25:23.760 align:start position:0%
change as opposed to just the last three
 
03:25:23.760 --> 03:25:26.990 align:start position:0%
change as opposed to just the last three
months

03:25:26.990 --> 03:25:27.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:27.000 --> 03:25:28.550 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:25:28.550 --> 03:25:28.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:25:31.610 --> 03:25:31.620 align:start position:0%
no it was the last
 
03:25:31.620 --> 03:25:34.070 align:start position:0%
no it was the last
calculating

03:25:34.070 --> 03:25:34.080 align:start position:0%
calculating
 
03:25:38.570 --> 03:25:38.580 align:start position:0%
it's the sustaining actual revenue from
 
03:25:40.670 --> 03:25:40.680 align:start position:0%
the first seven months plus sustaining
 
03:25:43.670 --> 03:25:43.680 align:start position:0%
percentage versus prior year
 
03:25:46.790 --> 03:25:46.800 align:start position:0%
for the last five months it would be
 
03:25:50.330 --> 03:25:50.340 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:53.990 --> 03:25:54.000 align:start position:0%
it was your option for when you
 
03:26:20.809 --> 03:26:20.819 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:22.250 --> 03:26:22.260 align:start position:0%
I just want to make sure I read you the
 
03:26:49.150 --> 03:26:49.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:52.070 --> 03:26:52.080 align:start position:0%
okay so sustaining percent essentially
 
03:26:55.610 --> 03:26:55.620 align:start position:0%
sustaining percent versus prior year
 
03:27:00.950 --> 03:27:00.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:03.130 --> 03:27:03.140 align:start position:0%
was 1 billion
 
03:27:09.650 --> 03:27:09.660 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:09.660 --> 03:27:11.210 align:start position:0%
 
one

03:27:11.210 --> 03:27:11.220 align:start position:0%
one
 
03:27:15.410 --> 03:27:15.420 align:start position:0%
one two six nine point five like five
 
03:27:17.630 --> 03:27:17.640 align:start position:0%
okay so these are really they're very
 
03:27:19.790 --> 03:27:19.800 align:start position:0%
close they're very close
 
03:27:22.370 --> 03:27:22.380 align:start position:0%
for business taxes in particular yeah
 
03:27:24.290 --> 03:27:24.300 align:start position:0%
you I believe when you did ask the
 
03:27:25.610 --> 03:27:25.620 align:start position:0%
question because I wrote it in the
 
03:27:27.769 --> 03:27:27.779 align:start position:0%
presentation you asked it on that first
 
03:27:29.570 --> 03:27:29.580 align:start position:0%
slide when we were going through all the
 
03:27:31.790 --> 03:27:31.800 align:start position:0%
different scenarios so we did apply it
 
03:27:33.469 --> 03:27:33.479 align:start position:0%
to all the taxes so that you would have
 
03:27:33.479 --> 03:27:37.370 align:start position:0%
to all the taxes so that you would have
it

03:27:37.370 --> 03:27:37.380 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:39.530 --> 03:27:39.540 align:start position:0%
Madam chair
 
03:27:41.330 --> 03:27:41.340 align:start position:0%
are these broad question times yes
 
03:27:43.490 --> 03:27:43.500 align:start position:0%
please go ahead okay I just wanted to
 
03:27:46.610 --> 03:27:46.620 align:start position:0%
double check the meals and rentals
 
03:27:46.620 --> 03:27:47.330 align:start position:0%
double check the meals and rentals
um

03:27:47.330 --> 03:27:47.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:27:50.269 --> 03:27:50.279 align:start position:0%
the we heard the governor's report and
 
03:27:52.610 --> 03:27:52.620 align:start position:0%
he's at the low end of your range so I
 
03:27:54.229 --> 03:27:54.239 align:start position:0%
just wanted to double check
 
03:27:56.750 --> 03:27:56.760 align:start position:0%
um I kind of know the answer your
 
03:27:59.929 --> 03:27:59.939 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:59.939 --> 03:28:01.969 align:start position:0%
 
he

03:28:01.969 --> 03:28:01.979 align:start position:0%
he
 
03:28:01.979 --> 03:28:04.250 align:start position:0%
he
um

03:28:04.250 --> 03:28:04.260 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:06.050 --> 03:28:06.060 align:start position:0%
they they shared they thought it was
 
03:28:07.550 --> 03:28:07.560 align:start position:0%
going to flatten out basically because
 
03:28:09.650 --> 03:28:09.660 align:start position:0%
it had kind of peaked but you didn't do
 
03:28:11.210 --> 03:28:11.220 align:start position:0%
it that way
 
03:28:13.550 --> 03:28:13.560 align:start position:0%
well we have a range of it flattening
 
03:28:17.630 --> 03:28:17.640 align:start position:0%
out to up to five percent growth
 
03:28:21.889 --> 03:28:21.899 align:start position:0%
um the reason for the five percent
 
03:28:21.899 --> 03:28:23.950 align:start position:0%
um the reason for the five percent
growth

03:28:23.950 --> 03:28:23.960 align:start position:0%
growth
 
03:28:27.290 --> 03:28:27.300 align:start position:0%
is historically
 
03:28:30.410 --> 03:28:30.420 align:start position:0%
before you know taking covid kind of out
 
03:28:32.510 --> 03:28:32.520 align:start position:0%
of the picture
 
03:28:32.520 --> 03:28:33.229 align:start position:0%
of the picture
um

03:28:33.229 --> 03:28:33.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:28:36.170 --> 03:28:36.180 align:start position:0%
it was historically
 
03:28:38.269 --> 03:28:38.279 align:start position:0%
m r Revenue
 
03:28:40.729 --> 03:28:40.739 align:start position:0%
grows about five percent year over year
 
03:28:43.490 --> 03:28:43.500 align:start position:0%
so that would essentially you know what
 
03:28:44.870 --> 03:28:44.880 align:start position:0%
we've seen in the past couple years has
 
03:28:46.969 --> 03:28:46.979 align:start position:0%
been obviously more than that
 
03:28:48.229 --> 03:28:48.239 align:start position:0%
um but we're either going to kind of
 
03:28:50.150 --> 03:28:50.160 align:start position:0%
stay flat and say that this is the new
 
03:28:52.190 --> 03:28:52.200 align:start position:0%
normal for m r we're going to stay flat
 
03:28:54.650 --> 03:28:54.660 align:start position:0%
through the next couple years or m r is
 
03:28:56.210 --> 03:28:56.220 align:start position:0%
going to continue to grow but not at the
 
03:28:58.010 --> 03:28:58.020 align:start position:0%
increased rate that we've seen the rate
 
03:29:00.469 --> 03:29:00.479 align:start position:0%
is going to kind of normalize so that's
 
03:29:03.830 --> 03:29:03.840 align:start position:0%
the Zero versus the five percent great
 
03:29:05.690 --> 03:29:05.700 align:start position:0%
that's helpful thank you and just to
 
03:29:07.070 --> 03:29:07.080 align:start position:0%
follow up on your question from this
 
03:29:09.650 --> 03:29:09.660 align:start position:0%
morning if I may
 
03:29:12.590 --> 03:29:12.600 align:start position:0%
um about m r kind of across the state
 
03:29:14.210 --> 03:29:14.220 align:start position:0%
and whether what you're seeing on the
 
03:29:16.309 --> 03:29:16.319 align:start position:0%
Seacoast is the same as what maybe other
 
03:29:18.830 --> 03:29:18.840 align:start position:0%
counties are seeing so in our
 
03:29:21.710 --> 03:29:21.720 align:start position:0%
presentation that's titled overview of
 
03:29:26.630 --> 03:29:26.640 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire taxes on slide 26 we show
 
03:29:30.050 --> 03:29:30.060 align:start position:0%
you the breakdown of meals rentals and
 
03:29:32.210 --> 03:29:32.220 align:start position:0%
motor vehicles for each of the counties
 
03:29:36.650 --> 03:29:36.660 align:start position:0%
and if you kind of couple that with the
 
03:29:39.590 --> 03:29:39.600 align:start position:0%
data that I have at least for February
 
03:29:43.090 --> 03:29:43.100 align:start position:0%
collections which would be January sales
 
03:29:46.809 --> 03:29:46.819 align:start position:0%
we continue to see year-over-year growth
 
03:29:50.570 --> 03:29:50.580 align:start position:0%
in all of our counties for m r with the
 
03:29:53.269 --> 03:29:53.279 align:start position:0%
exception of Carol and co-oz they're
 
03:29:55.130 --> 03:29:55.140 align:start position:0%
essentially flat
 
03:29:57.469 --> 03:29:57.479 align:start position:0%
what is interesting about that is from
 
03:30:00.590 --> 03:30:00.600 align:start position:0%
slide 26 Carol and koa's are the two
 
03:30:03.170 --> 03:30:03.180 align:start position:0%
counties with the largest I guess
 
03:30:06.830 --> 03:30:06.840 align:start position:0%
percent of meals versus rooms their
 
03:30:08.870 --> 03:30:08.880 align:start position:0%
meals and rooms revenue is almost equal
 
03:30:11.690 --> 03:30:11.700 align:start position:0%
where if you look say at Rockingham
 
03:30:14.030 --> 03:30:14.040 align:start position:0%
County 88 of the revenue in Rockingham
 
03:30:18.950 --> 03:30:18.960 align:start position:0%
County is meals with 11 being brooms so
 
03:30:21.110 --> 03:30:21.120 align:start position:0%
what I am kind of gathering by that
 
03:30:24.710 --> 03:30:24.720 align:start position:0%
observation is meals maybe are
 
03:30:27.110 --> 03:30:27.120 align:start position:0%
continuing to kind of Drive m r revenue
 
03:30:29.690 --> 03:30:29.700 align:start position:0%
and the rooms is where we might be
 
03:30:32.450 --> 03:30:32.460 align:start position:0%
seeing more of a stagnation and that's
 
03:30:34.610 --> 03:30:34.620 align:start position:0%
the disparity among the state counties
 
03:30:36.530 --> 03:30:36.540 align:start position:0%
thank you that's helpful okay
 
03:30:39.650 --> 03:30:39.660 align:start position:0%
representative platten yes thank you I'm
 
03:30:41.870 --> 03:30:41.880 align:start position:0%
going to put you on the spot uh
 
03:30:44.510 --> 03:30:44.520 align:start position:0%
I could see if you could refute anything
 
03:30:46.910 --> 03:30:46.920 align:start position:0%
I say okay I could see meals rooms going
 
03:30:48.710 --> 03:30:48.720 align:start position:0%
up a little bit short run because
 
03:30:50.750 --> 03:30:50.760 align:start position:0%
vendors are raising their prices to
 
03:30:52.910 --> 03:30:52.920 align:start position:0%
recover their costs and this we had the
 
03:30:55.849 --> 03:30:55.859 align:start position:0%
discussion and uh that it's a straight
 
03:30:57.469 --> 03:30:57.479 align:start position:0%
percentage I could see it going up a
 
03:30:59.030 --> 03:30:59.040 align:start position:0%
little bit but eventually people hit a
 
03:31:01.610 --> 03:31:01.620 align:start position:0%
wall and I'm spending it so it goes the
 
03:31:05.150 --> 03:31:05.160 align:start position:0%
other way and uh I I read the Wall
 
03:31:07.010 --> 03:31:07.020 align:start position:0%
Street I get vignettes out of that and
 
03:31:10.190 --> 03:31:10.200 align:start position:0%
again I I've mentioned this before I'm
 
03:31:13.849 --> 03:31:13.859 align:start position:0%
not using a pun Domino sales is flat uh
 
03:31:15.530 --> 03:31:15.540 align:start position:0%
in Domino's sales is black because they
 
03:31:18.530 --> 03:31:18.540 align:start position:0%
see more people eating at home and so I
 
03:31:21.889 --> 03:31:21.899 align:start position:0%
I do you see a potential for downside in
 
03:31:21.899 --> 03:31:23.150 align:start position:0%
I do you see a potential for downside in
2025

03:31:23.150 --> 03:31:23.160 align:start position:0%
2025
 
03:31:25.790 --> 03:31:25.800 align:start position:0%
I think so and we did you write um
 
03:31:27.229 --> 03:31:27.239 align:start position:0%
representative kind of talk about this
 
03:31:29.330 --> 03:31:29.340 align:start position:0%
when we were talking about m r generally
 
03:31:32.090 --> 03:31:32.100 align:start position:0%
obviously if inflation continues to go
 
03:31:34.849 --> 03:31:34.859 align:start position:0%
up in prices to continue to go up so
 
03:31:36.590 --> 03:31:36.600 align:start position:0%
long as consumers are willing to still
 
03:31:38.809 --> 03:31:38.819 align:start position:0%
pay those prices we will see continue to
 
03:31:40.610 --> 03:31:40.620 align:start position:0%
see an increase in the m r tax because
 
03:31:42.410 --> 03:31:42.420 align:start position:0%
the tax is paid on the price of the meal
 
03:31:45.229 --> 03:31:45.239 align:start position:0%
for instance but when that inflation or
 
03:31:47.150 --> 03:31:47.160 align:start position:0%
those prices reach that point where
 
03:31:50.150 --> 03:31:50.160 align:start position:0%
consumers start to back away that's when
 
03:31:52.130 --> 03:31:52.140 align:start position:0%
you know we're potentially going to see
 
03:31:55.429 --> 03:31:55.439 align:start position:0%
it I don't know that it will turn down
 
03:31:57.950 --> 03:31:57.960 align:start position:0%
or if it will just stop growing at the
 
03:31:59.809 --> 03:31:59.819 align:start position:0%
rate that it's been growing
 
03:32:02.210 --> 03:32:02.220 align:start position:0%
so that is that that's kind of the The
 
03:32:08.250 --> 03:32:08.260 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:08.260 --> 03:32:12.410 align:start position:0%
 
[Laughter]

03:32:12.410 --> 03:32:12.420 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:15.050 --> 03:32:15.060 align:start position:0%
representative fellows thank you
 
03:32:18.469 --> 03:32:18.479 align:start position:0%
um on the topic of the meals taxation of
 
03:32:22.070 --> 03:32:22.080 align:start position:0%
the meals do you have any sense of the
 
03:32:26.389 --> 03:32:26.399 align:start position:0%
split between fast food places and the
 
03:32:29.630 --> 03:32:29.640 align:start position:0%
higher end restaurants
 
03:32:32.870 --> 03:32:32.880 align:start position:0%
I do so actually let me switch to
 
03:32:43.510 --> 03:32:43.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:49.190 --> 03:32:49.200 align:start position:0%
so this is looking at data for
 
03:32:51.950 --> 03:32:51.960 align:start position:0%
January revenues which would have been
 
03:32:55.490 --> 03:32:55.500 align:start position:0%
December activity so December
 
03:32:57.950 --> 03:32:57.960 align:start position:0%
um sales so
 
03:32:59.870 --> 03:32:59.880 align:start position:0%
year over year
 
03:33:02.330 --> 03:33:02.340 align:start position:0%
full service restaurants
 
03:33:05.929 --> 03:33:05.939 align:start position:0%
were up nine percent
 
03:33:08.929 --> 03:33:08.939 align:start position:0%
fast food and snack bars were up just
 
03:33:11.889 --> 03:33:11.899 align:start position:0%
under 17 percent
 
03:33:11.899 --> 03:33:13.849 align:start position:0%
under 17 percent
17.

03:33:13.849 --> 03:33:13.859 align:start position:0%
17.
 
03:33:16.670 --> 03:33:16.680 align:start position:0%
and that is kind of a trend that we have
 
03:33:21.229 --> 03:33:21.239 align:start position:0%
seen you know obviously during the
 
03:33:23.450 --> 03:33:23.460 align:start position:0%
um early months of covid when shutdown
 
03:33:25.130 --> 03:33:25.140 align:start position:0%
orders were starting to be lifted a lot
 
03:33:26.269 --> 03:33:26.279 align:start position:0%
of full-service restaurants were not
 
03:33:28.309 --> 03:33:28.319 align:start position:0%
open but fast food was so a lot of
 
03:33:30.650 --> 03:33:30.660 align:start position:0%
people gravitated towards fast food then
 
03:33:32.630 --> 03:33:32.640 align:start position:0%
I think as the pandemic
 
03:33:35.690 --> 03:33:35.700 align:start position:0%
you know increased different types of
 
03:33:39.010 --> 03:33:39.020 align:start position:0%
fast food options are now more available
 
03:33:43.370 --> 03:33:43.380 align:start position:0%
so we do continue to see meals growing
 
03:33:47.450 --> 03:33:47.460 align:start position:0%
in general during that same period
 
03:33:50.750 --> 03:33:50.760 align:start position:0%
food as a whole grew just under 12
 
03:33:50.760 --> 03:33:53.150 align:start position:0%
food as a whole grew just under 12
percent

03:33:53.150 --> 03:33:53.160 align:start position:0%
percent
 
03:33:56.929 --> 03:33:56.939 align:start position:0%
in total so everyone's growing just
 
03:33:59.210 --> 03:33:59.220 align:start position:0%
maybe fast food continues to grow still
 
03:34:03.229 --> 03:34:03.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:06.410 --> 03:34:06.420 align:start position:0%
so I I actually that's that's good I'm
 
03:34:08.150 --> 03:34:08.160 align:start position:0%
glad to hear that I actually was
 
03:34:10.969 --> 03:34:10.979 align:start position:0%
thinking in terms of what percentage of
 
03:34:13.670 --> 03:34:13.680 align:start position:0%
the revenue that comes in is from the
 
03:34:16.309 --> 03:34:16.319 align:start position:0%
full service versus the fast food
 
03:34:16.319 --> 03:34:19.070 align:start position:0%
full service versus the fast food
category

03:34:19.070 --> 03:34:19.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:19.080 --> 03:34:20.269 align:start position:0%
 
uh

03:34:20.269 --> 03:34:20.279 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:34:22.090 --> 03:34:22.100 align:start position:0%
uh I can
 
03:34:24.050 --> 03:34:24.060 align:start position:0%
well here how about this I'll give you
 
03:34:26.210 --> 03:34:26.220 align:start position:0%
the numbers
 
03:34:26.220 --> 03:34:27.050 align:start position:0%
the numbers
um

03:34:27.050 --> 03:34:27.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:34:29.870 --> 03:34:29.880 align:start position:0%
full service restaurants
 
03:34:29.880 --> 03:34:31.670 align:start position:0%
full service restaurants
in

03:34:31.670 --> 03:34:31.680 align:start position:0%
in
 
03:34:35.510 --> 03:34:35.520 align:start position:0%
December of this year generated 14.7
 
03:34:35.520 --> 03:34:40.429 align:start position:0%
December of this year generated 14.7
million

03:34:40.429 --> 03:34:40.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:44.929 --> 03:34:44.939 align:start position:0%
fast food generated 7.2 million
 
03:34:49.389 --> 03:34:49.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:51.950 --> 03:34:51.960 align:start position:0%
representative orrs
 
03:34:53.690 --> 03:34:53.700 align:start position:0%
thank you madam Karen thanks for taking
 
03:34:57.250 --> 03:34:57.260 align:start position:0%
my question so overall is the trend in
 
03:35:00.290 --> 03:35:00.300 align:start position:0%
full-service restaurants up or down flat
 
03:35:03.110 --> 03:35:03.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:06.349 --> 03:35:06.359 align:start position:0%
I would say up overall okay is there any
 
03:35:18.490 --> 03:35:18.500 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:21.110 --> 03:35:21.120 align:start position:0%
the growth rate this month is pretty
 
03:35:22.490 --> 03:35:22.500 align:start position:0%
consistent with the year-over-year
 
03:35:24.769 --> 03:35:24.779 align:start position:0%
growth that we saw last month so I think
 
03:35:24.779 --> 03:35:26.030 align:start position:0%
growth that we saw last month so I think
no

03:35:26.030 --> 03:35:26.040 align:start position:0%
no
 
03:35:27.490 --> 03:35:27.500 align:start position:0%
and I'm sure
 
03:35:29.389 --> 03:35:29.399 align:start position:0%
representative software thank you follow
 
03:35:29.399 --> 03:35:30.229 align:start position:0%
representative software thank you follow
up

03:35:30.229 --> 03:35:30.239 align:start position:0%
up
 
03:35:32.269 --> 03:35:32.279 align:start position:0%
um I'm not a coffee drinker but I'm
 
03:35:35.150 --> 03:35:35.160 align:start position:0%
amazed at the lines I have three coffee
 
03:35:37.070 --> 03:35:37.080 align:start position:0%
places near my house and that's all
 
03:35:39.229 --> 03:35:39.239 align:start position:0%
counting in the fast food
 
03:35:41.210 --> 03:35:41.220 align:start position:0%
potentially so
 
03:35:43.490 --> 03:35:43.500 align:start position:0%
we have kind of these broad activity
 
03:35:45.769 --> 03:35:45.779 align:start position:0%
codes and The Operators when they
 
03:35:47.929 --> 03:35:47.939 align:start position:0%
request a license from the Department of
 
03:35:51.469 --> 03:35:51.479 align:start position:0%
Revenue they note what sort of activity
 
03:35:55.070 --> 03:35:55.080 align:start position:0%
code they fall under so it is likely
 
03:35:57.050 --> 03:35:57.060 align:start position:0%
um that coffee would probably be under
 
03:36:00.290 --> 03:36:00.300 align:start position:0%
fast food we also have a bakery category
 
03:36:03.050 --> 03:36:03.060 align:start position:0%
but unless they're primarily a bakery I
 
03:36:04.429 --> 03:36:04.439 align:start position:0%
think if you know you're talking about
 
03:36:07.190 --> 03:36:07.200 align:start position:0%
your drive through Dunkin Donuts
 
03:36:08.750 --> 03:36:08.760 align:start position:0%
Starbucks that sort of thing they're
 
03:36:13.010 --> 03:36:13.020 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:16.429 --> 03:36:16.439 align:start position:0%
representative almie thank you we've got
 
03:36:18.650 --> 03:36:18.660 align:start position:0%
a fair number of restaurants in my area
 
03:36:22.090 --> 03:36:22.100 align:start position:0%
that have gone into pickup
 
03:36:25.010 --> 03:36:25.020 align:start position:0%
which I guess would be classified as
 
03:36:26.929 --> 03:36:26.939 align:start position:0%
fast food but there are also
 
03:36:28.849 --> 03:36:28.859 align:start position:0%
full-service restaurants they would
 
03:36:30.410 --> 03:36:30.420 align:start position:0%
likely still be under full service
 
03:36:32.269 --> 03:36:32.279 align:start position:0%
because the operator again is going to
 
03:36:33.710 --> 03:36:33.720 align:start position:0%
designate when they apply for that
 
03:36:36.429 --> 03:36:36.439 align:start position:0%
license what sort of
 
03:36:39.050 --> 03:36:39.060 align:start position:0%
activity they perform so if you're
 
03:36:40.729 --> 03:36:40.739 align:start position:0%
performing sit down and take out it's
 
03:36:42.170 --> 03:36:42.180 align:start position:0%
likely you're going to call yourself a
 
03:36:43.670 --> 03:36:43.680 align:start position:0%
full-service restaurant but I think
 
03:36:47.150 --> 03:36:47.160 align:start position:0%
we've talked previously about how the
 
03:36:49.250 --> 03:36:49.260 align:start position:0%
pivoting of these full-service
 
03:36:52.130 --> 03:36:52.140 align:start position:0%
restaurants to those fast food or a
 
03:36:55.010 --> 03:36:55.020 align:start position:0%
faster takeout type options a lot of
 
03:36:56.690 --> 03:36:56.700 align:start position:0%
them now have online ordering you know
 
03:36:58.250 --> 03:36:58.260 align:start position:0%
even a full-service restaurant has the
 
03:37:00.910 --> 03:37:00.920 align:start position:0%
ability to online order and pick up
 
03:37:03.170 --> 03:37:03.180 align:start position:0%
that a lot of restaurants did kind of
 
03:37:04.670 --> 03:37:04.680 align:start position:0%
pivot to that and that has probably
 
03:37:06.889 --> 03:37:06.899 align:start position:0%
contributed to the increase in sales as
 
03:37:09.849 --> 03:37:09.859 align:start position:0%
well the convenience
 
03:37:12.410 --> 03:37:12.420 align:start position:0%
representative plot yes thank you what
 
03:37:13.490 --> 03:37:13.500 align:start position:0%
difference does it make if we're
 
03:37:15.950 --> 03:37:15.960 align:start position:0%
categorized under fast food or full
 
03:37:18.410 --> 03:37:18.420 align:start position:0%
service it's the same percentage it is
 
03:37:21.590 --> 03:37:21.600 align:start position:0%
it's just a way for us to kind of see
 
03:37:25.550 --> 03:37:25.560 align:start position:0%
um what's happening within the tax base
 
03:37:28.370 --> 03:37:28.380 align:start position:0%
um so it's just it at the very basic
 
03:37:31.190 --> 03:37:31.200 align:start position:0%
level it separates out food rooms and
 
03:37:33.290 --> 03:37:33.300 align:start position:0%
motor vehicles and then we can drill
 
03:37:34.729 --> 03:37:34.739 align:start position:0%
down a little bit further as we're doing
 
03:37:36.650 --> 03:37:36.660 align:start position:0%
now but yes it's all taxed at the same
 
03:37:39.950 --> 03:37:39.960 align:start position:0%
amount it's all paid by the consumer so
 
03:37:43.190 --> 03:37:43.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:45.469 --> 03:37:45.479 align:start position:0%
representative Almy thank you I think
 
03:37:49.309 --> 03:37:49.319 align:start position:0%
when we first started this the idea was
 
03:37:51.830 --> 03:37:51.840 align:start position:0%
more that lower income people were going
 
03:37:54.110 --> 03:37:54.120 align:start position:0%
to be eating the fast food and
 
03:37:56.030 --> 03:37:56.040 align:start position:0%
higher income people were going to be in
 
03:37:59.750 --> 03:37:59.760 align:start position:0%
the restaurant and that's definition is
 
03:37:59.760 --> 03:38:01.849 align:start position:0%
the restaurant and that's definition is
disappearing

03:38:01.849 --> 03:38:01.859 align:start position:0%
disappearing
 
03:38:01.859 --> 03:38:06.410 align:start position:0%
disappearing
sure

03:38:06.410 --> 03:38:06.420 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:08.630 --> 03:38:08.640 align:start position:0%
representative Phelps
 
03:38:10.309 --> 03:38:10.319 align:start position:0%
I'm just sitting here your lights on
 
03:38:12.040 --> 03:38:12.050 align:start position:0%
that's why
 
03:38:12.050 --> 03:38:15.250 align:start position:0%
that's why
[Laughter]

03:38:15.250 --> 03:38:15.260 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
03:38:18.830 --> 03:38:18.840 align:start position:0%
okay uh this is your chance to ask lots
 
03:38:21.290 --> 03:38:21.300 align:start position:0%
of questions unless you want to pick a
 
03:38:24.050 --> 03:38:24.060 align:start position:0%
one particular column and really drill
 
03:38:25.849 --> 03:38:25.859 align:start position:0%
down right now go ahead representative
 
03:38:27.950 --> 03:38:27.960 align:start position:0%
all me
 
03:38:32.269 --> 03:38:32.279 align:start position:0%
thank you and there's about 11 million
 
03:38:35.389 --> 03:38:35.399 align:start position:0%
in refunds in interest in dividends year
 
03:38:36.410 --> 03:38:36.420 align:start position:0%
to date
 
03:38:42.410 --> 03:38:42.420 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:46.370 --> 03:38:46.380 align:start position:0%
uh and it's almost doubly amount of
 
03:38:46.380 --> 03:38:47.809 align:start position:0%
uh and it's almost doubly amount of
refunds

03:38:47.809 --> 03:38:47.819 align:start position:0%
refunds
 
03:38:50.630 --> 03:38:50.640 align:start position:0%
last year year to date
 
03:38:54.170 --> 03:38:54.180 align:start position:0%
and the business tax rev refunds are up
 
03:38:58.030 --> 03:38:58.040 align:start position:0%
a third over the prior year and almost
 
03:39:03.229 --> 03:39:03.239 align:start position:0%
half of it was in December January
 
03:39:05.809 --> 03:39:05.819 align:start position:0%
um and but both of them are still the
 
03:39:08.389 --> 03:39:08.399 align:start position:0%
most they've ever been in 11 years here
 
03:39:11.630 --> 03:39:11.640 align:start position:0%
to date so so a couple of thoughts on
 
03:39:14.929 --> 03:39:14.939 align:start position:0%
that one the timing in terms of December
 
03:39:19.250 --> 03:39:19.260 align:start position:0%
January when returns our calendar year
 
03:39:21.950 --> 03:39:21.960 align:start position:0%
returns are received on extension
 
03:39:24.110 --> 03:39:24.120 align:start position:0%
so on a seven month extension they're
 
03:39:25.729 --> 03:39:25.739 align:start position:0%
typically received in October or
 
03:39:28.330 --> 03:39:28.340 align:start position:0%
November November corresponding to April
 
03:39:30.769 --> 03:39:30.779 align:start position:0%
we then have
 
03:39:30.779 --> 03:39:31.550 align:start position:0%
we then have
um

03:39:31.550 --> 03:39:31.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:39:34.010 --> 03:39:34.020 align:start position:0%
60 days I believe no 90 days to pay the
 
03:39:36.530 --> 03:39:36.540 align:start position:0%
refund before it hits interest so you'll
 
03:39:39.290 --> 03:39:39.300 align:start position:0%
often see refunds paid this time of year
 
03:39:41.090 --> 03:39:41.100 align:start position:0%
because it's the processing of those
 
03:39:43.969 --> 03:39:43.979 align:start position:0%
Returns on a timely manner and we try
 
03:39:46.610 --> 03:39:46.620 align:start position:0%
very hard not to pay interest so the the
 
03:39:48.710 --> 03:39:48.720 align:start position:0%
timing is consistent with those returns
 
03:39:50.870 --> 03:39:50.880 align:start position:0%
filed on extension in terms of them
 
03:39:53.150 --> 03:39:53.160 align:start position:0%
being the largest amounts that we've
 
03:39:55.370 --> 03:39:55.380 align:start position:0%
seen revenue is also the largest that
 
03:39:57.889 --> 03:39:57.899 align:start position:0%
we've seen so it just kind of correlates
 
03:39:59.809 --> 03:39:59.819 align:start position:0%
with more Revenue you'd see more refunds
 
03:40:02.150 --> 03:40:02.160 align:start position:0%
we have looked at it extensively to make
 
03:40:05.630 --> 03:40:05.640 align:start position:0%
sure that there's not a systematic
 
03:40:07.670 --> 03:40:07.680 align:start position:0%
problem or there's not you know
 
03:40:10.370 --> 03:40:10.380 align:start position:0%
something out there that taxpayers were
 
03:40:11.809 --> 03:40:11.819 align:start position:0%
misinformed and we're making payments
 
03:40:13.010 --> 03:40:13.020 align:start position:0%
when they shouldn't have that sort of
 
03:40:15.950 --> 03:40:15.960 align:start position:0%
thing it really just seems to be
 
03:40:19.010 --> 03:40:19.020 align:start position:0%
um just a higher overall volume there's
 
03:40:21.410 --> 03:40:21.420 align:start position:0%
always anomalous refunds large you know
 
03:40:23.870 --> 03:40:23.880 align:start position:0%
one-time refunds but really what we're
 
03:40:26.090 --> 03:40:26.100 align:start position:0%
seeing is there's just the base is
 
03:40:28.010 --> 03:40:28.020 align:start position:0%
there's just more of them there are more
 
03:40:29.389 --> 03:40:29.399 align:start position:0%
taxpayers than we've ever seen there's
 
03:40:31.070 --> 03:40:31.080 align:start position:0%
more money than that we've ever seen so
 
03:40:35.210 --> 03:40:35.220 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:38.389 --> 03:40:38.399 align:start position:0%
representative Ames
 
03:40:43.670 --> 03:40:43.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:43.680 --> 03:40:46.070 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:40:46.070 --> 03:40:46.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:48.349 --> 03:40:48.359 align:start position:0%
I'm going to ask you this if you look at
 
03:40:49.969 --> 03:40:49.979 align:start position:0%
the business taxes
 
03:40:52.910 --> 03:40:52.920 align:start position:0%
and you're high and lows and you you go
 
03:40:54.710 --> 03:40:54.720 align:start position:0%
low all the way through
 
03:40:57.530 --> 03:40:57.540 align:start position:0%
the three years and if you do the same
 
03:40:59.030 --> 03:40:59.040 align:start position:0%
for the highs
 
03:41:02.030 --> 03:41:02.040 align:start position:0%
the difference is a lot of money
 
03:41:04.849 --> 03:41:04.859 align:start position:0%
um close to 200 million I think
 
03:41:07.309 --> 03:41:07.319 align:start position:0%
um and
 
03:41:08.990 --> 03:41:09.000 align:start position:0%
what I
 
03:41:13.550 --> 03:41:13.560 align:start position:0%
want to ask is uh is a whether there's
 
03:41:15.469 --> 03:41:15.479 align:start position:0%
any new information that's come to your
 
03:41:19.030 --> 03:41:19.040 align:start position:0%
attention our new ideas about this
 
03:41:22.070 --> 03:41:22.080 align:start position:0%
that push you in one direction or the
 
03:41:25.010 --> 03:41:25.020 align:start position:0%
other or whether you're you're inclined
 
03:41:28.429 --> 03:41:28.439 align:start position:0%
to advise us that
 
03:41:30.469 --> 03:41:30.479 align:start position:0%
one side or another of this is more
 
03:41:36.769 --> 03:41:36.779 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:36.779 --> 03:41:40.070 align:start position:0%
 
understood

03:41:40.070 --> 03:41:40.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:40.080 --> 03:41:41.450 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:41:41.450 --> 03:41:41.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:41:43.910 --> 03:41:43.920 align:start position:0%
the more information is going to come
 
03:41:46.790 --> 03:41:46.800 align:start position:0%
next month which is it's hard to hear I
 
03:41:46.800 --> 03:41:48.050 align:start position:0%
next month which is it's hard to hear I
know

03:41:48.050 --> 03:41:48.060 align:start position:0%
know
 
03:41:48.060 --> 03:41:49.010 align:start position:0%
know
um

03:41:49.010 --> 03:41:49.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:41:53.030 --> 03:41:53.040 align:start position:0%
once we start seeing returns in March
 
03:41:56.469 --> 03:41:56.479 align:start position:0%
that will help us a little bit more
 
03:41:59.690 --> 03:41:59.700 align:start position:0%
understand you know where things are
 
03:41:59.700 --> 03:42:01.309 align:start position:0%
understand you know where things are
trending

03:42:01.309 --> 03:42:01.319 align:start position:0%
trending
 
03:42:04.849 --> 03:42:04.859 align:start position:0%
um I would say in terms of any new
 
03:42:06.530 --> 03:42:06.540 align:start position:0%
information I know
 
03:42:08.690 --> 03:42:08.700 align:start position:0%
um Phil Sutton copied us on a response
 
03:42:11.389 --> 03:42:11.399 align:start position:0%
to the committee about some research he
 
03:42:13.370 --> 03:42:13.380 align:start position:0%
had kind of put together in terms of
 
03:42:16.429 --> 03:42:16.439 align:start position:0%
just general economic Trends and what
 
03:42:19.910 --> 03:42:19.920 align:start position:0%
various sources are saying and I you
 
03:42:21.950 --> 03:42:21.960 align:start position:0%
know I think all of his sources kind of
 
03:42:23.950 --> 03:42:23.960 align:start position:0%
lined up as well with the range
 
03:42:26.510 --> 03:42:26.520 align:start position:0%
understanding that the range does
 
03:42:30.410 --> 03:42:30.420 align:start position:0%
produce a large range of dollar amounts
 
03:42:30.420 --> 03:42:31.210 align:start position:0%
produce a large range of dollar amounts
um

03:42:31.210 --> 03:42:31.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:42:34.130 --> 03:42:34.140 align:start position:0%
I don't think we have any more
 
03:42:36.410 --> 03:42:36.420 align:start position:0%
information at this point it's probably
 
03:42:36.420 --> 03:42:38.630 align:start position:0%
information at this point it's probably
forthcoming

03:42:38.630 --> 03:42:38.640 align:start position:0%
forthcoming
 
03:42:41.750 --> 03:42:41.760 align:start position:0%
um the only I guess
 
03:42:46.010 --> 03:42:46.020 align:start position:0%
reference point is that
 
03:42:49.610 --> 03:42:49.620 align:start position:0%
it looks as though February business tax
 
03:42:52.010 --> 03:42:52.020 align:start position:0%
revenues are coming in a little bit
 
03:42:54.170 --> 03:42:54.180 align:start position:0%
lower than plan in a little bit lower
 
03:42:57.229 --> 03:42:57.239 align:start position:0%
than prior year again February tends to
 
03:42:59.990 --> 03:43:00.000 align:start position:0%
be a smaller month and some of that can
 
03:43:02.150 --> 03:43:02.160 align:start position:0%
be a bit of a timing difference where we
 
03:43:04.849 --> 03:43:04.859 align:start position:0%
may have either last year received late
 
03:43:08.210 --> 03:43:08.220 align:start position:0%
payments from the December January time
 
03:43:09.769 --> 03:43:09.779 align:start position:0%
frame or early payments from March or
 
03:43:12.650 --> 03:43:12.660 align:start position:0%
April but I mean that is the first time
 
03:43:14.750 --> 03:43:14.760 align:start position:0%
that we've seen business taxes kind of
 
03:43:18.110 --> 03:43:18.120 align:start position:0%
not knocking plan and prior year out of
 
03:43:20.750 --> 03:43:20.760 align:start position:0%
the water so that might give me a little
 
03:43:23.030 --> 03:43:23.040 align:start position:0%
bit of hesitation but again I wouldn't
 
03:43:25.610 --> 03:43:25.620 align:start position:0%
put a lot of weight in the February
 
03:43:29.030 --> 03:43:29.040 align:start position:0%
numbers where plan is 21.3 million and
 
03:43:30.710 --> 03:43:30.720 align:start position:0%
we're talking over a billion in Revenue
 
03:43:33.830 --> 03:43:33.840 align:start position:0%
so just the materiality of it but the
 
03:43:35.030 --> 03:43:35.040 align:start position:0%
fact that we're a little bit below prior
 
03:43:37.250 --> 03:43:37.260 align:start position:0%
year and a little bit below plan
 
03:43:41.090 --> 03:43:41.100 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:43.729 --> 03:43:43.739 align:start position:0%
um yeah I saw that I'm sorry I saw that
 
03:43:43.739 --> 03:43:45.349 align:start position:0%
um yeah I saw that I'm sorry I saw that
February

03:43:45.349 --> 03:43:45.359 align:start position:0%
February
 
03:43:48.889 --> 03:43:48.899 align:start position:0%
um whatever it is and um wondered about
 
03:43:48.899 --> 03:43:49.790 align:start position:0%
um whatever it is and um wondered about
it

03:43:49.790 --> 03:43:49.800 align:start position:0%
it
 
03:43:52.330 --> 03:43:52.340 align:start position:0%
um and it's too small as you just said
 
03:43:55.790 --> 03:43:55.800 align:start position:0%
to take anything away but I I guess one
 
03:43:58.490 --> 03:43:58.500 align:start position:0%
piece of the information that I don't
 
03:44:00.229 --> 03:44:00.239 align:start position:0%
think had come out yet was the estimates
 
03:44:03.170 --> 03:44:03.180 align:start position:0%
and whether there's any change in the
 
03:44:05.269 --> 03:44:05.279 align:start position:0%
estimates Trend that might be picked up
 
03:44:08.570 --> 03:44:08.580 align:start position:0%
there uh you know
 
03:44:11.389 --> 03:44:11.399 align:start position:0%
I don't think so yeah we shouldn't go
 
03:44:13.729 --> 03:44:13.739 align:start position:0%
too far with February I I agree with you
 
03:44:15.530 --> 03:44:15.540 align:start position:0%
on that yeah
 
03:44:18.429 --> 03:44:18.439 align:start position:0%
representative elderly I'm Albert
 
03:44:21.590 --> 03:44:21.600 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry thank you madam chair sorry
 
03:44:21.600 --> 03:44:23.030 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry thank you madam chair sorry
just

03:44:23.030 --> 03:44:23.040 align:start position:0%
just
 
03:44:25.729 --> 03:44:25.739 align:start position:0%
since we're down in the noise already is
 
03:44:28.729 --> 03:44:28.739 align:start position:0%
it possible that any of that drop
 
03:44:31.070 --> 03:44:31.080 align:start position:0%
is related to weather and particularly
 
03:44:35.510 --> 03:44:35.520 align:start position:0%
say lack of snow up in the mountains so
 
03:44:36.830 --> 03:44:36.840 align:start position:0%
um ski stuff
 
03:44:40.429 --> 03:44:40.439 align:start position:0%
in turn that would we would likely see
 
03:44:42.650 --> 03:44:42.660 align:start position:0%
that in our m r Revenue
 
03:44:44.389 --> 03:44:44.399 align:start position:0%
um and you're right those two counties
 
03:44:46.849 --> 03:44:46.859 align:start position:0%
that I mentioned where um they were
 
03:44:48.530 --> 03:44:48.540 align:start position:0%
performing a little bit lower than last
 
03:44:50.450 --> 03:44:50.460 align:start position:0%
year where kolas and Carol to counties
 
03:44:54.170 --> 03:44:54.180 align:start position:0%
that would benefit from a snowier winter
 
03:44:55.849 --> 03:44:55.859 align:start position:0%
um so that definitely could be part of
 
03:44:57.650 --> 03:44:57.660 align:start position:0%
it now of course we're into a week where
 
03:44:59.150 --> 03:44:59.160 align:start position:0%
it seems like it's going to snow every
 
03:45:02.110 --> 03:45:02.120 align:start position:0%
other day so winter has finally arranged
 
03:45:04.969 --> 03:45:04.979 align:start position:0%
representative Platt I know you put a
 
03:45:07.250 --> 03:45:07.260 align:start position:0%
tremendous amount of thought into all of
 
03:45:09.349 --> 03:45:09.359 align:start position:0%
these Revenue projections high and low
 
03:45:12.710 --> 03:45:12.720 align:start position:0%
but that was done how long ago these
 
03:45:15.050 --> 03:45:15.060 align:start position:0%
Road numbers for by the dra couple of
 
03:45:17.170 --> 03:45:17.180 align:start position:0%
months so we update them every month
 
03:45:20.150 --> 03:45:20.160 align:start position:0%
what James referred to this morning the
 
03:45:23.090 --> 03:45:23.100 align:start position:0%
revenue estimates of ours that he used
 
03:45:25.550 --> 03:45:25.560 align:start position:0%
to produce the governor's budget were
 
03:45:27.889 --> 03:45:27.899 align:start position:0%
revenues through December given the
 
03:45:29.750 --> 03:45:29.760 align:start position:0%
timing and then we updated them through
 
03:45:32.150 --> 03:45:32.160 align:start position:0%
January when we came to you and we will
 
03:45:34.729 --> 03:45:34.739 align:start position:0%
update them later this week to go
 
03:45:36.830 --> 03:45:36.840 align:start position:0%
through February as well I guess by
 
03:45:39.590 --> 03:45:39.600 align:start position:0%
basic question is you've got all the
 
03:45:42.349 --> 03:45:42.359 align:start position:0%
data you can get so is there any is your
 
03:45:44.809 --> 03:45:44.819 align:start position:0%
gut telling you that there's any one of
 
03:45:46.370 --> 03:45:46.380 align:start position:0%
these Revenue estimates that's going to
 
03:45:48.170 --> 03:45:48.180 align:start position:0%
be below your low or higher than your
 
03:45:55.370 --> 03:45:55.380 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:59.030 --> 03:45:59.040 align:start position:0%
representative fellows so I have um the
 
03:46:00.830 --> 03:46:00.840 align:start position:0%
questions that I was asking about the
 
03:46:02.870 --> 03:46:02.880 align:start position:0%
meals I have the same kind of question
 
03:46:06.410 --> 03:46:06.420 align:start position:0%
for the business taxes because my
 
03:46:08.630 --> 03:46:08.640 align:start position:0%
recollection is that
 
03:46:14.150 --> 03:46:14.160 align:start position:0%
there's just a few 16 or so corporations
 
03:46:16.910 --> 03:46:16.920 align:start position:0%
pay the vast majority of the business
 
03:46:20.750 --> 03:46:20.760 align:start position:0%
taxes so if you're seeing upward or
 
03:46:23.090 --> 03:46:23.100 align:start position:0%
downward Trends if you could tell us
 
03:46:26.450 --> 03:46:26.460 align:start position:0%
about those big ones versus the other
 
03:46:29.090 --> 03:46:29.100 align:start position:0%
ones anything along that line
 
03:46:32.389 --> 03:46:32.399 align:start position:0%
so you are correct that the majority of
 
03:46:34.969 --> 03:46:34.979 align:start position:0%
business tax payer business tax revenue
 
03:46:37.910 --> 03:46:37.920 align:start position:0%
comes in from a few taxpayers
 
03:46:37.920 --> 03:46:39.469 align:start position:0%
comes in from a few taxpayers
and

03:46:39.469 --> 03:46:39.479 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:46:41.090 --> 03:46:41.100 align:start position:0%
those of you that have kind of been on
 
03:46:43.610 --> 03:46:43.620 align:start position:0%
the committee during the past few years
 
03:46:46.190 --> 03:46:46.200 align:start position:0%
especially during covid
 
03:46:48.650 --> 03:46:48.660 align:start position:0%
it remained true that the majority of
 
03:46:51.769 --> 03:46:51.779 align:start position:0%
Revenue still came from a few taxpayers
 
03:46:54.830 --> 03:46:54.840 align:start position:0%
it's just those types of taxpayers may
 
03:46:58.010 --> 03:46:58.020 align:start position:0%
have changed as certain businesses or
 
03:47:01.250 --> 03:47:01.260 align:start position:0%
industries did better during the coveted
 
03:47:04.550 --> 03:47:04.560 align:start position:0%
pandemic than others so we talked
 
03:47:06.050 --> 03:47:06.060 align:start position:0%
um when we were Revenue estimating last
 
03:47:08.389 --> 03:47:08.399 align:start position:0%
time about you know retail did really
 
03:47:10.610 --> 03:47:10.620 align:start position:0%
well right people still wanted to buy
 
03:47:12.590 --> 03:47:12.600 align:start position:0%
things during covet obviously medical
 
03:47:16.010 --> 03:47:16.020 align:start position:0%
supplies medical devices did well but
 
03:47:18.410 --> 03:47:18.420 align:start position:0%
restaurants or the hospitality industry
 
03:47:20.690 --> 03:47:20.700 align:start position:0%
during those initial phases of covid
 
03:47:24.650 --> 03:47:24.660 align:start position:0%
certainly were hurt by it so we still
 
03:47:27.050 --> 03:47:27.060 align:start position:0%
see that small number at the top it is
 
03:47:31.010 --> 03:47:31.020 align:start position:0%
typically a variety of Industries but
 
03:47:32.750 --> 03:47:32.760 align:start position:0%
sometimes they kind of come and go based
 
03:47:34.610 --> 03:47:34.620 align:start position:0%
on what's happening in the economy at
 
03:47:35.870 --> 03:47:35.880 align:start position:0%
that time
 
03:47:38.690 --> 03:47:38.700 align:start position:0%
I don't have the same activity level
 
03:47:41.330 --> 03:47:41.340 align:start position:0%
data that I do for m r for business
 
03:47:41.340 --> 03:47:56.269 align:start position:0%
data that I do for m r for business
taxes

03:47:56.269 --> 03:47:56.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:58.550 --> 03:47:58.560 align:start position:0%
would it make sense to try to attack
 
03:48:02.330 --> 03:48:02.340 align:start position:0%
something like meals and rooms now I
 
03:48:03.830 --> 03:48:03.840 align:start position:0%
would rather go for something more
 
03:48:06.710 --> 03:48:06.720 align:start position:0%
stable that we could probably just
 
03:48:08.450 --> 03:48:08.460 align:start position:0%
throwing out there while we have the
 
03:48:10.010 --> 03:48:10.020 align:start position:0%
commissioner here I don't know pick pick
 
03:48:12.530 --> 03:48:12.540 align:start position:0%
whatever you want tobacco tobacco might
 
03:48:14.630 --> 03:48:14.640 align:start position:0%
be a great topic
 
03:48:16.849 --> 03:48:16.859 align:start position:0%
when we think about tobacco any let's go
 
03:48:18.710 --> 03:48:18.720 align:start position:0%
to Tobacco see if we have any remaining
 
03:48:32.630 --> 03:48:32.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:34.910 --> 03:48:34.920 align:start position:0%
I will just note with tobacco if I may
 
03:48:38.389 --> 03:48:38.399 align:start position:0%
Madam chair the you know the ranges are
 
03:48:40.790 --> 03:48:40.800 align:start position:0%
um are pretty small you know we're we're
 
03:48:43.250 --> 03:48:43.260 align:start position:0%
looking at looking at page four of your
 
03:48:45.889 --> 03:48:45.899 align:start position:0%
of your worksheet
 
03:48:48.130 --> 03:48:48.140 align:start position:0%
um 217 to
 
03:48:50.809 --> 03:48:50.819 align:start position:0%
222.8 so a little over five million
 
03:48:53.990 --> 03:48:54.000 align:start position:0%
dollar you know spread not the 200
 
03:48:55.370 --> 03:48:55.380 align:start position:0%
million that we're looking at with
 
03:48:57.229 --> 03:48:57.239 align:start position:0%
business taxes
 
03:49:00.050 --> 03:49:00.060 align:start position:0%
um so those are tighter ranges you know
 
03:49:01.729 --> 03:49:01.739 align:start position:0%
the governor
 
03:49:03.349 --> 03:49:03.359 align:start position:0%
um is kind of right in that middle of
 
03:49:06.290 --> 03:49:06.300 align:start position:0%
the range for 23 a little closer to the
 
03:49:09.889 --> 03:49:09.899 align:start position:0%
higher end in 24 and 25 but again those
 
03:49:12.769 --> 03:49:12.779 align:start position:0%
those ranges are pretty tight it's a
 
03:49:16.130 --> 03:49:16.140 align:start position:0%
tax that we feel like we know generally
 
03:49:18.170 --> 03:49:18.180 align:start position:0%
what's going to happen there
 
03:49:20.450 --> 03:49:20.460 align:start position:0%
representative Madam chair all
 
03:49:22.190 --> 03:49:22.200 align:start position:0%
throughout a straw poll and see if it
 
03:49:24.769 --> 03:49:24.779 align:start position:0%
crumbles in Hay
 
03:49:24.779 --> 03:49:27.650 align:start position:0%
crumbles in Hay
okay

03:49:27.650 --> 03:49:27.660 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:29.150 --> 03:49:29.160 align:start position:0%
hold off on that please uh
 
03:49:31.849 --> 03:49:31.859 align:start position:0%
representative Almy has a question yes I
 
03:49:35.330 --> 03:49:35.340 align:start position:0%
just want you go down to the low with
 
03:49:38.870 --> 03:49:38.880 align:start position:0%
five percent the next year and then only
 
03:49:42.590 --> 03:49:42.600 align:start position:0%
three percent the year after what's that
 
03:49:45.590 --> 03:49:45.600 align:start position:0%
so the five percent
 
03:49:48.650 --> 03:49:48.660 align:start position:0%
the negative five percent is kind of a
 
03:49:51.889 --> 03:49:51.899 align:start position:0%
more aggressive normalizing of tobacco
 
03:49:55.610 --> 03:49:55.620 align:start position:0%
where we have started to see kind of
 
03:49:59.510 --> 03:49:59.520 align:start position:0%
this downturn occurring as we mentioned
 
03:50:02.630 --> 03:50:02.640 align:start position:0%
potentially as folks shift away from
 
03:50:06.110 --> 03:50:06.120 align:start position:0%
traditional cigarettes into other
 
03:50:08.269 --> 03:50:08.279 align:start position:0%
tobacco products
 
03:50:11.150 --> 03:50:11.160 align:start position:0%
um and so the minus five percent kind of
 
03:50:14.630 --> 03:50:14.640 align:start position:0%
assumes that Trend continues
 
03:50:16.190 --> 03:50:16.200 align:start position:0%
um that we've been seeing we've been
 
03:50:19.550 --> 03:50:19.560 align:start position:0%
about minus five to minus seven percent
 
03:50:21.410 --> 03:50:21.420 align:start position:0%
year over year
 
03:50:22.849 --> 03:50:22.859 align:start position:0%
um throughout this year so kind of
 
03:50:24.410 --> 03:50:24.420 align:start position:0%
assuming that Trend continues and then
 
03:50:25.729 --> 03:50:25.739 align:start position:0%
representative about me as you know the
 
03:50:27.889 --> 03:50:27.899 align:start position:0%
minus three percent is just kind of the
 
03:50:29.929 --> 03:50:29.939 align:start position:0%
traditional year-over-year decrease in
 
03:50:32.510 --> 03:50:32.520 align:start position:0%
in the tobacco tax that we were seeing
 
03:50:34.969 --> 03:50:34.979 align:start position:0%
um in the Years leading up to covid
 
03:50:36.950 --> 03:50:36.960 align:start position:0%
um so it's just a little bit more of an
 
03:50:38.630 --> 03:50:38.640 align:start position:0%
aggressive decline in the first year and
 
03:50:40.309 --> 03:50:40.319 align:start position:0%
then kind of moving back to that more
 
03:50:41.870 --> 03:50:41.880 align:start position:0%
historic Norm
 
03:50:44.929 --> 03:50:44.939 align:start position:0%
yeah Madam chair how much would that
 
03:50:46.910 --> 03:50:46.920 align:start position:0%
have to do with
 
03:50:49.610 --> 03:50:49.620 align:start position:0%
um the adaptation of the Massachusetts
 
03:50:53.269 --> 03:50:53.279 align:start position:0%
Use users of Menthol that is another
 
03:50:55.490 --> 03:50:55.500 align:start position:0%
potential part of it right we saw a
 
03:50:57.590 --> 03:50:57.600 align:start position:0%
spike in revenues here in New Hampshire
 
03:50:59.269 --> 03:50:59.279 align:start position:0%
that have been documented when
 
03:51:02.030 --> 03:51:02.040 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts ban methylated products a
 
03:51:04.610 --> 03:51:04.620 align:start position:0%
lot of people came to New Hampshire to
 
03:51:06.830 --> 03:51:06.840 align:start position:0%
buy those products some may still be
 
03:51:08.929 --> 03:51:08.939 align:start position:0%
coming here some may have switched to a
 
03:51:10.490 --> 03:51:10.500 align:start position:0%
different product that they then can now
 
03:51:13.010 --> 03:51:13.020 align:start position:0%
purchase in Massachusetts again so it
 
03:51:15.050 --> 03:51:15.060 align:start position:0%
could be some of that as well where
 
03:51:17.450 --> 03:51:17.460 align:start position:0%
they've decided that for whatever reason
 
03:51:18.590 --> 03:51:18.600 align:start position:0%
they don't need to come to New Hampshire
 
03:51:20.570 --> 03:51:20.580 align:start position:0%
to buy those products anymore and so
 
03:51:21.950 --> 03:51:21.960 align:start position:0%
that could be contributing to the
 
03:51:23.450 --> 03:51:23.460 align:start position:0%
decline as well
 
03:51:26.630 --> 03:51:26.640 align:start position:0%
representative Southworth uh thank you
 
03:51:29.750 --> 03:51:29.760 align:start position:0%
um is there an explanation for yours
 
03:51:31.550 --> 03:51:31.560 align:start position:0%
being like five million more
 
03:51:36.170 --> 03:51:36.180 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:37.729 --> 03:51:37.739 align:start position:0%
um no I think it's just the result of
 
03:51:39.889 --> 03:51:39.899 align:start position:0%
producing a range yeah
 
03:51:42.590 --> 03:51:42.600 align:start position:0%
um he it we go through a very similar
 
03:51:44.809 --> 03:51:44.819 align:start position:0%
exercise with the governor where we
 
03:51:47.450 --> 03:51:47.460 align:start position:0%
produce ranges and so
 
03:51:49.309 --> 03:51:49.319 align:start position:0%
um I think his amount just ended up kind
 
03:51:50.570 --> 03:51:50.580 align:start position:0%
of some he picked somewhere in the
 
03:51:51.950 --> 03:51:51.960 align:start position:0%
middle of the range and we're giving you
 
03:51:53.570 --> 03:51:53.580 align:start position:0%
the rain the same range or a very
 
03:51:55.309 --> 03:51:55.319 align:start position:0%
similar range okay so there's no
 
03:51:58.309 --> 03:51:58.319 align:start position:0%
specific reason thank you
 
03:51:58.319 --> 03:52:00.410 align:start position:0%
specific reason thank you
foreign

03:52:00.410 --> 03:52:00.420 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
03:52:00.420 --> 03:52:04.309 align:start position:0%
foreign
Pole

03:52:04.309 --> 03:52:04.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:07.190 --> 03:52:07.200 align:start position:0%
I believe so yeah okay
 
03:52:10.849 --> 03:52:10.859 align:start position:0%
um I believe the agency I believe the
 
03:52:13.729 --> 03:52:13.739 align:start position:0%
agency could be wrong or either way so
 
03:52:15.769 --> 03:52:15.779 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm suggesting split the difference
 
03:52:17.870 --> 03:52:17.880 align:start position:0%
between agency low and high
 
03:52:21.469 --> 03:52:21.479 align:start position:0%
for tobacco which would be 219
 
03:52:33.170 --> 03:52:33.180 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:35.530 --> 03:52:35.540 align:start position:0%
uh for uh
 
03:52:37.490 --> 03:52:37.500 align:start position:0%
219.9 is fine
 
03:52:40.130 --> 03:52:40.140 align:start position:0%
uh which which the governor had but the
 
03:52:44.870 --> 03:52:44.880 align:start position:0%
214 4 and 24 and 211 4 and 25 which is
 
03:52:46.610 --> 03:52:46.620 align:start position:0%
about splitting the difference
 
03:52:49.729 --> 03:52:49.739 align:start position:0%
between uh the agency's high and low
 
03:52:52.429 --> 03:52:52.439 align:start position:0%
all right can we restate that wait do we
 
03:52:55.550 --> 03:52:55.560 align:start position:0%
have a second I'm sorry
 
03:52:58.389 --> 03:52:58.399 align:start position:0%
sure go ahead
 
03:53:00.889 --> 03:53:00.899 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um yeah I was just
 
03:53:01.969 --> 03:53:01.979 align:start position:0%
look just looking at these numbers
 
03:53:06.410 --> 03:53:06.420 align:start position:0%
quickly agency high for 23 24 and 25 is
 
03:53:07.910 --> 03:53:07.920 align:start position:0%
the same number if you're seeing a
 
03:53:11.690 --> 03:53:11.700 align:start position:0%
degradation in tobacco why pick this the
 
03:53:13.670 --> 03:53:13.680 align:start position:0%
high to be the same and not having a
 
03:53:16.250 --> 03:53:16.260 align:start position:0%
declining high so again it was just a
 
03:53:19.429 --> 03:53:19.439 align:start position:0%
result of kind of producing a range so
 
03:53:21.469 --> 03:53:21.479 align:start position:0%
um in many taxes you'll see the range
 
03:53:23.269 --> 03:53:23.279 align:start position:0%
kind of goes from Flat to growth in
 
03:53:25.250 --> 03:53:25.260 align:start position:0%
tobacco it's going the other way so we
 
03:53:28.070 --> 03:53:28.080 align:start position:0%
may find that the decline that we've
 
03:53:31.490 --> 03:53:31.500 align:start position:0%
seen over the past year or so those that
 
03:53:33.170 --> 03:53:33.180 align:start position:0%
have switched are gonna have switched
 
03:53:34.670 --> 03:53:34.680 align:start position:0%
those that have gone back to purchasing
 
03:53:36.110 --> 03:53:36.120 align:start position:0%
their products in Massachusetts have
 
03:53:37.429 --> 03:53:37.439 align:start position:0%
gone back to purchasing their products
 
03:53:38.990 --> 03:53:39.000 align:start position:0%
in Massachusetts and then we're just
 
03:53:41.990 --> 03:53:42.000 align:start position:0%
going to kind of continue Where We Are
 
03:53:43.790 --> 03:53:43.800 align:start position:0%
it's probably more likely that we're
 
03:53:45.769 --> 03:53:45.779 align:start position:0%
going to continue to fall but you know
 
03:53:47.450 --> 03:53:47.460 align:start position:0%
it could be that you know this is kind
 
03:53:49.130 --> 03:53:49.140 align:start position:0%
of the bottom and we're just going to
 
03:53:50.510 --> 03:53:50.520 align:start position:0%
stay here
 
03:53:54.710 --> 03:53:54.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:00.349 --> 03:54:00.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:02.090 --> 03:54:02.100 align:start position:0%
all right any more discussion or do we
 
03:54:03.530 --> 03:54:03.540 align:start position:0%
want to review what those numbers are
 
03:54:05.450 --> 03:54:05.460 align:start position:0%
one more time I'd like
 
03:54:10.150 --> 03:54:10.160 align:start position:0%
to okay so uh column C under tobacco
 
03:54:15.290 --> 03:54:15.300 align:start position:0%
fy23 I said 219. FY 23 I said 219 9
 
03:54:17.030 --> 03:54:17.040 align:start position:0%
which is the governor's estimate it's
 
03:54:21.290 --> 03:54:21.300 align:start position:0%
about splits theirs but for fy24 I split
 
03:54:22.969 --> 03:54:22.979 align:start position:0%
the agency high and low and came up with
 
03:54:24.889 --> 03:54:24.899 align:start position:0%
214 4.
 
03:54:27.889 --> 03:54:27.899 align:start position:0%
and for 25 I split the agency higher low
 
03:54:35.330 --> 03:54:35.340 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:37.370 --> 03:54:37.380 align:start position:0%
can we get a show of hands for everyone
 
03:54:42.590 --> 03:54:42.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:45.469 --> 03:54:45.479 align:start position:0%
all right I think it's almost unanimous
 
03:54:49.070 --> 03:54:49.080 align:start position:0%
let me just see anyone who's opposed
 
03:54:53.389 --> 03:54:53.399 align:start position:0%
one okay so it would be 14 to 1 to take
 
03:55:00.469 --> 03:55:00.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:02.030 --> 03:55:02.040 align:start position:0%
Madam chair yes representative
 
03:55:04.490 --> 03:55:04.500 align:start position:0%
Southworth I'd like to continue and do
 
03:55:06.349 --> 03:55:06.359 align:start position:0%
meals and rooms because I just feel like
 
03:55:07.790 --> 03:55:07.800 align:start position:0%
we just got a lot of detailed
 
03:55:10.550 --> 03:55:10.560 align:start position:0%
information about it so I mean I think
 
03:55:12.530 --> 03:55:12.540 align:start position:0%
we have time to go forward on that a
 
03:55:16.309 --> 03:55:16.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:19.429 --> 03:55:19.439 align:start position:0%
um wondering how are we doing for time
 
03:55:19.439 --> 03:55:21.429 align:start position:0%
um wondering how are we doing for time
here

03:55:21.429 --> 03:55:21.439 align:start position:0%
here
 
03:55:24.290 --> 03:55:24.300 align:start position:0%
yeah representative you said did you say
 
03:55:26.389 --> 03:55:26.399 align:start position:0%
you have to leave soon too yeah I don't
 
03:55:28.269 --> 03:55:28.279 align:start position:0%
know if we have time okay
 
03:55:30.530 --> 03:55:30.540 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm just concerned because that
 
03:55:32.689 --> 03:55:32.699 align:start position:0%
might take a half an hour and I have no
 
03:55:34.309 --> 03:55:34.319 align:start position:0%
at least one person who has to leave and
 
03:55:37.250 --> 03:55:37.260 align:start position:0%
that would be a bummer yeah thank you I
 
03:55:38.689 --> 03:55:38.699 align:start position:0%
was thinking of easier ones like
 
03:55:45.170 --> 03:55:45.180 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:47.090 --> 03:55:47.100 align:start position:0%
requested more data from the insurance
 
03:55:48.889 --> 03:55:48.899 align:start position:0%
department which they will be providing
 
03:55:51.469 --> 03:55:51.479 align:start position:0%
tomorrow so to be able to hear that data
 
03:55:52.910 --> 03:55:52.920 align:start position:0%
I think we should probably hold off on
 
03:55:55.010 --> 03:55:55.020 align:start position:0%
that one liquor may be something we
 
03:55:56.990 --> 03:55:57.000 align:start position:0%
could look at although the commissioner
 
03:56:00.290 --> 03:56:00.300 align:start position:0%
doesn't do those numbers right so
 
03:56:02.750 --> 03:56:02.760 align:start position:0%
um but we could take a look at that uh
 
03:56:04.790 --> 03:56:04.800 align:start position:0%
Chris do you wanna
 
03:56:32.570 --> 03:56:32.580 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:35.389 --> 03:56:35.399 align:start position:0%
okay you you did receive a full packet
 
03:56:37.550 --> 03:56:37.560 align:start position:0%
from liquor
 
03:56:44.330 --> 03:56:44.340 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:46.370 --> 03:56:46.380 align:start position:0%
in addition I had sent an email out with
 
03:56:48.050 --> 03:56:48.060 align:start position:0%
some information from liquor I think
 
03:56:50.269 --> 03:56:50.279 align:start position:0%
there was some questions as to why
 
03:56:51.889 --> 03:56:51.899 align:start position:0%
um Liquors numbers were higher than the
 
03:56:54.889 --> 03:56:54.899 align:start position:0%
governors in 24 and 25 and then why the
 
03:56:58.969 --> 03:56:58.979 align:start position:0%
governor was higher in 23 than liquor I
 
03:57:00.229 --> 03:57:00.239 align:start position:0%
think you heard this morning from
 
03:57:03.170 --> 03:57:03.180 align:start position:0%
director Gary that they the governor
 
03:57:05.570 --> 03:57:05.580 align:start position:0%
stands by the 135 number that they've
 
03:57:08.689 --> 03:57:08.699 align:start position:0%
suggested not the 130 that the
 
03:57:08.699 --> 03:57:09.769 align:start position:0%
suggested not the 130 that the
um

03:57:09.769 --> 03:57:09.779 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:57:12.370 --> 03:57:12.380 align:start position:0%
liquid commission has suggested for 23
 
03:57:17.330 --> 03:57:17.340 align:start position:0%
and then the difference for 24 and 25 in
 
03:57:18.889 --> 03:57:18.899 align:start position:0%
terms of what liquor presented to you
 
03:57:22.309 --> 03:57:22.319 align:start position:0%
and what the governor had according to
 
03:57:24.590 --> 03:57:24.600 align:start position:0%
the Liquor Commission related to um uh
 
03:57:26.330 --> 03:57:26.340 align:start position:0%
pay raise they took money out for the
 
03:57:27.710 --> 03:57:27.720 align:start position:0%
pay raise if you do that it brings them
 
03:57:29.150 --> 03:57:29.160 align:start position:0%
down to closer to what the governor
 
03:57:29.160 --> 03:57:32.269 align:start position:0%
down to closer to what the governor
recommended

03:57:32.269 --> 03:57:32.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:35.809 --> 03:57:35.819 align:start position:0%
my notes say that the governor's office
 
03:57:38.210 --> 03:57:38.220 align:start position:0%
said that they're actually the same
 
03:57:41.809 --> 03:57:41.819 align:start position:0%
number in 2023
 
03:57:45.410 --> 03:57:45.420 align:start position:0%
one was 135 one was 130 but the 130
 
03:57:48.830 --> 03:57:48.840 align:start position:0%
includes the transfer to
 
03:57:53.389 --> 03:57:53.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:55.550 --> 03:57:55.560 align:start position:0%
okay so basically 130 would be the
 
03:57:58.189 --> 03:57:58.199 align:start position:0%
appropriate number or
 
03:57:58.199 --> 03:58:00.170 align:start position:0%
appropriate number or
so

03:58:00.170 --> 03:58:00.180 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:58:01.849 --> 03:58:01.859 align:start position:0%
I think what the agency provided you is
 
03:58:03.710 --> 03:58:03.720 align:start position:0%
that 130 would be the transfer to the
 
03:58:06.349 --> 03:58:06.359 align:start position:0%
general fund right okay so 130 is the
 
03:58:07.849 --> 03:58:07.859 align:start position:0%
right number okay
 
03:58:10.550 --> 03:58:10.560 align:start position:0%
for 2023.
 
03:58:12.349 --> 03:58:12.359 align:start position:0%
representative all me
 
03:58:15.050 --> 03:58:15.060 align:start position:0%
the governor was
 
03:58:18.590 --> 03:58:18.600 align:start position:0%
wasn't he using the same
 
03:58:21.710 --> 03:58:21.720 align:start position:0%
same idea of transfer to the general
 
03:58:21.720 --> 03:58:27.889 align:start position:0%
same idea of transfer to the general
fund

03:58:27.889 --> 03:58:27.899 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:27.899 --> 03:58:30.469 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

03:58:30.469 --> 03:58:30.479 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
03:58:30.479 --> 03:58:33.170 align:start position:0%
yeah
but

03:58:33.170 --> 03:58:33.180 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:58:33.180 --> 03:58:34.729 align:start position:0%
but
I

03:58:34.729 --> 03:58:34.739 align:start position:0%
I
 
03:58:37.010 --> 03:58:37.020 align:start position:0%
would be quite willing to assume that
 
03:58:38.570 --> 03:58:38.580 align:start position:0%
the agency knows more about their
 
03:58:42.010 --> 03:58:42.020 align:start position:0%
numbers than the governor does but
 
03:58:45.050 --> 03:58:45.060 align:start position:0%
uh representative Platt I try a straw
 
03:58:47.150 --> 03:58:47.160 align:start position:0%
here I can get shot down no big deal but
 
03:58:49.070 --> 03:58:49.080 align:start position:0%
I'll try it
 
03:58:53.389 --> 03:58:53.399 align:start position:0%
um for one at 130 for fiscal 23 which is
 
03:58:55.429 --> 03:58:55.439 align:start position:0%
the agency's high and low
 
03:58:57.710 --> 03:58:57.720 align:start position:0%
and I think the governor says it's the
 
03:58:59.030 --> 03:58:59.040 align:start position:0%
same his as high because he didn't take
 
03:59:01.990 --> 03:59:02.000 align:start position:0%
the stuff out it needs to be taken out
 
03:59:07.070 --> 03:59:07.080 align:start position:0%
135 9 for 2024 and 135.6 for 20
 
03:59:07.080 --> 03:59:12.849 align:start position:0%
135 9 for 2024 and 135.6 for 20
25

03:59:12.849 --> 03:59:12.859 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:18.830 --> 03:59:18.840 align:start position:0%
135 9 135 9 for 2024 which is the agency
 
03:59:20.870 --> 03:59:20.880 align:start position:0%
hired low
 
03:59:24.710 --> 03:59:24.720 align:start position:0%
and then 135 6 for 2025 which is the
 
03:59:26.389 --> 03:59:26.399 align:start position:0%
agency high and low
 
03:59:27.889 --> 03:59:27.899 align:start position:0%
all right I have different numbers than
 
03:59:31.610 --> 03:59:31.620 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:34.189 --> 03:59:34.199 align:start position:0%
so representative Sanborn you may be
 
03:59:37.070 --> 03:59:37.080 align:start position:0%
looking at older numbers
 
03:59:40.309 --> 03:59:40.319 align:start position:0%
so that the 135 9 and the 135 6 are the
 
03:59:42.110 --> 03:59:42.120 align:start position:0%
numbers that were adjusted by removing
 
03:59:43.969 --> 03:59:43.979 align:start position:0%
the amounts they would need for the pay
 
03:59:46.969 --> 03:59:46.979 align:start position:0%
raise it's February 26. hand it out
 
04:00:01.269 --> 04:00:01.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:04.130 --> 04:00:04.140 align:start position:0%
okay uh do I have a second on that first
 
04:00:05.570 --> 04:00:05.580 align:start position:0%
of all
 
04:00:08.210 --> 04:00:08.220 align:start position:0%
representative Southworth seconds okay
 
04:00:10.370 --> 04:00:10.380 align:start position:0%
all right and comments representative
 
04:00:13.189 --> 04:00:13.199 align:start position:0%
elmy oh just one more question to Chris
 
04:00:13.199 --> 04:00:14.870 align:start position:0%
elmy oh just one more question to Chris
on

04:00:14.870 --> 04:00:14.880 align:start position:0%
on
 
04:00:18.830 --> 04:00:18.840 align:start position:0%
The Liquor Commission had to transfer
 
04:00:21.410 --> 04:00:21.420 align:start position:0%
over beyond the 5 million I think that
 
04:00:23.929 --> 04:00:23.939 align:start position:0%
they were originally allocated anything
 
04:00:25.729 --> 04:00:25.739 align:start position:0%
more that Health and Human Services
 
04:00:28.610 --> 04:00:28.620 align:start position:0%
needed for expanded medicaid
 
04:00:34.429 --> 04:00:34.439 align:start position:0%
uh is that ending in in July
 
04:00:36.950 --> 04:00:36.960 align:start position:0%
so um
 
04:00:39.170 --> 04:00:39.180 align:start position:0%
they don't anticipate in a further
 
04:00:42.349 --> 04:00:42.359 align:start position:0%
transfer this year in 23. right now
 
04:00:46.250 --> 04:00:46.260 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:48.889 --> 04:00:48.899 align:start position:0%
just over 18 million dollars
 
04:00:51.830 --> 04:00:51.840 align:start position:0%
the budgeted amount was the 11.5 million
 
04:00:54.530 --> 04:00:54.540 align:start position:0%
which is related to the 5 transfer to
 
04:00:57.170 --> 04:00:57.180 align:start position:0%
the drug and alcohol fund
 
04:00:59.450 --> 04:00:59.460 align:start position:0%
and then there was an additional 7
 
04:01:02.389 --> 04:01:02.399 align:start position:0%
million point two transfer that is a
 
04:01:04.010 --> 04:01:04.020 align:start position:0%
result of short
 
04:01:05.750 --> 04:01:05.760 align:start position:0%
um the granted Advantage fund being
 
04:01:08.389 --> 04:01:08.399 align:start position:0%
short to pay its bills so there's two
 
04:01:11.090 --> 04:01:11.100 align:start position:0%
statutes in play here but um the second
 
04:01:14.269 --> 04:01:14.279 align:start position:0%
statute which is RSA 126aa which is the
 
04:01:16.189 --> 04:01:16.199 align:start position:0%
granted Advantage Medicaid expansion
 
04:01:16.199 --> 04:01:17.269 align:start position:0%
granted Advantage Medicaid expansion
fund

04:01:17.269 --> 04:01:17.279 align:start position:0%
fund
 
04:01:19.550 --> 04:01:19.560 align:start position:0%
um they don't they be an HHS does not
 
04:01:21.290 --> 04:01:21.300 align:start position:0%
anticipate any further money needed for
 
04:01:22.429 --> 04:01:22.439 align:start position:0%
that this year
 
04:01:24.650 --> 04:01:24.660 align:start position:0%
they also don't anticipate going into
 
04:01:26.750 --> 04:01:26.760 align:start position:0%
the out years potentially needing it if
 
04:01:28.429 --> 04:01:28.439 align:start position:0%
the law stays current because they
 
04:01:30.110 --> 04:01:30.120 align:start position:0%
expect the roles to come down on
 
04:01:31.969 --> 04:01:31.979 align:start position:0%
Medicaid which has been what's driving
 
04:01:35.510 --> 04:01:35.520 align:start position:0%
some of the the needed revenue for
 
04:01:35.520 --> 04:01:37.370 align:start position:0%
some of the the needed revenue for
liquor

04:01:37.370 --> 04:01:37.380 align:start position:0%
liquor
 
04:01:40.070 --> 04:01:40.080 align:start position:0%
but it's it's a crapshoot in terms of if
 
04:01:42.590 --> 04:01:42.600 align:start position:0%
for some reason the the case loads stay
 
04:01:45.410 --> 04:01:45.420 align:start position:0%
up which isn't anticipated but if they
 
04:01:47.030 --> 04:01:47.040 align:start position:0%
were to stay up they might need to do it
 
04:01:48.889 --> 04:01:48.899 align:start position:0%
and the law allows for that but it's not
 
04:01:50.929 --> 04:01:50.939 align:start position:0%
what's planned for it's the just the
 
04:01:53.990 --> 04:01:54.000 align:start position:0%
five percent transfer but if that showed
 
04:01:56.870 --> 04:01:56.880 align:start position:0%
up before July 1
 
04:01:59.750 --> 04:01:59.760 align:start position:0%
they would put that would go into the
 
04:02:02.389 --> 04:02:02.399 align:start position:0%
Surplus statement rather than into the
 
04:02:08.750 --> 04:02:08.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:11.630 --> 04:02:11.640 align:start position:0%
okay we have a motion that's been a
 
04:02:14.570 --> 04:02:14.580 align:start position:0%
seconded uh any more discussion on the
 
04:02:18.650 --> 04:02:18.660 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:21.290 --> 04:02:21.300 align:start position:0%
okay all of those in favor of accepting
 
04:02:26.269 --> 04:02:26.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:30.469 --> 04:02:30.479 align:start position:0%
looks like everyone anyone opposed
 
04:02:36.050 --> 04:02:36.060 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:38.750 --> 04:02:38.760 align:start position:0%
all right it's now two
 
04:02:42.050 --> 04:02:42.060 align:start position:0%
um why don't we stop now
 
04:02:44.269 --> 04:02:44.279 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
04:02:47.269 --> 04:02:47.279 align:start position:0%
tomorrow we're on for 10.
 
04:02:50.809 --> 04:02:50.819 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:52.729 --> 04:02:52.739 align:start position:0%
do we want to try to make it in because
 
04:02:54.830 --> 04:02:54.840 align:start position:0%
last week the storm that they said was 6
 
04:02:56.750 --> 04:02:56.760 align:start position:0%
to 12 inches turned out to be a lot less
 
04:02:58.610 --> 04:02:58.620 align:start position:0%
or do what do we want to do what do
 
04:03:00.530 --> 04:03:00.540 align:start position:0%
everyone jump in and tell me your
 
04:03:00.540 --> 04:03:03.590 align:start position:0%
everyone jump in and tell me your
thoughts

04:03:03.590 --> 04:03:03.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:06.349 --> 04:03:06.359 align:start position:0%
we're under time pressure I'd say try to
 
04:03:07.729 --> 04:03:07.739 align:start position:0%
make it up here and see what we can do
 
04:03:09.170 --> 04:03:09.180 align:start position:0%
if we have to break early because it's
 
04:03:11.450 --> 04:03:11.460 align:start position:0%
continuous snowing we can break early
 
04:03:13.309 --> 04:03:13.319 align:start position:0%
yeah man
 
04:03:14.809 --> 04:03:14.819 align:start position:0%
um representative
 
04:03:16.309 --> 04:03:16.319 align:start position:0%
yeah the
 
04:03:18.469 --> 04:03:18.479 align:start position:0%
I think the storm is supposed to start
 
04:03:20.150 --> 04:03:20.160 align:start position:0%
at midnight
 
04:03:24.889 --> 04:03:24.899 align:start position:0%
so hopefully most of it will be over by
 
04:03:27.590 --> 04:03:27.600 align:start position:0%
the time we might break early no
 
04:03:30.110 --> 04:03:30.120 align:start position:0%
we have a oh representative spilsbury
 
04:03:32.389 --> 04:03:32.399 align:start position:0%
and I'm sorry that's not consistent with
 
04:03:35.090 --> 04:03:35.100 align:start position:0%
the forecast I saw
 
04:03:36.710 --> 04:03:36.720 align:start position:0%
but it depends what part of the state
 
04:03:38.689 --> 04:03:38.699 align:start position:0%
you're into right three to five four to
 
04:03:42.650 --> 04:03:42.660 align:start position:0%
eight Etc is the ranges I do not intend
 
04:03:44.090 --> 04:03:44.100 align:start position:0%
to drive in tomorrow morning the
 
04:03:45.650 --> 04:03:45.660 align:start position:0%
forecast indicates the snow will start
 
04:03:48.729 --> 04:03:48.739 align:start position:0%
around 1 to 3 A.M and it'll continue
 
04:03:51.290 --> 04:03:51.300 align:start position:0%
heavy through the morning so I don't
 
04:03:53.570 --> 04:03:53.580 align:start position:0%
intend to drive in the snow I would love
 
04:03:55.610 --> 04:03:55.620 align:start position:0%
to come on Wednesday when it's 43
 
04:03:57.410 --> 04:03:57.420 align:start position:0%
degrees and sunny and stay as long as it
 
04:03:57.420 --> 04:04:01.729 align:start position:0%
degrees and sunny and stay as long as it
takes

04:04:01.729 --> 04:04:01.739 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:04.610 --> 04:04:04.620 align:start position:0%
well if we one moment and then we'll
 
04:04:06.110 --> 04:04:06.120 align:start position:0%
come to you and everyone else
 
04:04:09.349 --> 04:04:09.359 align:start position:0%
um if we so Wednesday is our deadline so
 
04:04:11.990 --> 04:04:12.000 align:start position:0%
if we just do that we can come in at 10
 
04:04:14.570 --> 04:04:14.580 align:start position:0%
and stay till we're done the other
 
04:04:17.330 --> 04:04:17.340 align:start position:0%
option is we could start tomorrow later
 
04:04:19.849 --> 04:04:19.859 align:start position:0%
but we could lose the presentations if
 
04:04:21.469 --> 04:04:21.479 align:start position:0%
we end up you know because they can only
 
04:04:23.750 --> 04:04:23.760 align:start position:0%
get rescheduled so much so we might lose
 
04:04:25.790 --> 04:04:25.800 align:start position:0%
the presentations and we might have to
 
04:04:28.070 --> 04:04:28.080 align:start position:0%
ask them to email us their thoughts and
 
04:04:28.080 --> 04:04:29.210 align:start position:0%
ask them to email us their thoughts and
wisdom

04:04:29.210 --> 04:04:29.220 align:start position:0%
wisdom
 
04:04:30.889 --> 04:04:30.899 align:start position:0%
if you're okay with that we could maybe
 
04:04:34.070 --> 04:04:34.080 align:start position:0%
start at one tomorrow how would who
 
04:04:39.229 --> 04:04:39.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:42.110 --> 04:04:42.120 align:start position:0%
most maybe not okay
 
04:04:43.490 --> 04:04:43.500 align:start position:0%
um Madam chair representative fellows
 
04:04:45.590 --> 04:04:45.600 align:start position:0%
yeah I just wanted to say that where I
 
04:04:48.830 --> 04:04:48.840 align:start position:0%
live is right in the epicenter of the
 
04:04:50.929 --> 04:04:50.939 align:start position:0%
four to eight range like right on why
 
04:04:54.590 --> 04:04:54.600 align:start position:0%
they say eight so I would feel like a
 
04:04:57.050 --> 04:04:57.060 align:start position:0%
lot better I was going to suggest 11 but
 
04:05:00.170 --> 04:05:00.180 align:start position:0%
and the later the better would work for
 
04:05:01.969 --> 04:05:01.979 align:start position:0%
me yeah because I really do want to come
 
04:05:04.370 --> 04:05:04.380 align:start position:0%
in but it doesn't even doesn't sound
 
04:05:06.950 --> 04:05:06.960 align:start position:0%
very safe to try to drive in at nine
 
04:05:09.830 --> 04:05:09.840 align:start position:0%
okay representative Elmer I'm looking at
 
04:05:11.510 --> 04:05:11.520 align:start position:0%
the National Weather Service forecast
 
04:05:14.990 --> 04:05:15.000 align:start position:0%
thank you rather than just the other one
 
04:05:20.389 --> 04:05:20.399 align:start position:0%
and um the uh according to this the
 
04:05:22.610 --> 04:05:22.620 align:start position:0%
percentage of precipitation or the
 
04:05:25.849 --> 04:05:25.859 align:start position:0%
chance of precipitation starting at uh
 
04:05:30.650 --> 04:05:30.660 align:start position:0%
about 10 in the morning is 87 and
 
04:05:35.150 --> 04:05:35.160 align:start position:0%
doesn't drop below 70 until about five
 
04:05:37.130 --> 04:05:37.140 align:start position:0%
so it's supposed to be pretty awful
 
04:05:39.889 --> 04:05:39.899 align:start position:0%
smack in the middle of all the potential
 
04:05:41.269 --> 04:05:41.279 align:start position:0%
work time
 
04:05:43.610 --> 04:05:43.620 align:start position:0%
and then early representative Doucette
 
04:05:46.490 --> 04:05:46.500 align:start position:0%
how about called the chair at 7 A.M you
 
04:05:49.550 --> 04:05:49.560 align:start position:0%
make the call and let us know via email
 
04:05:52.429 --> 04:05:52.439 align:start position:0%
or whatever and we'll take a picket pick
 
04:05:55.189 --> 04:05:55.199 align:start position:0%
a look at 701 and go from there
 
04:05:57.050 --> 04:05:57.060 align:start position:0%
well in the end we could make a decision
 
04:05:58.670 --> 04:05:58.680 align:start position:0%
and the speaker might say this whole
 
04:06:00.530 --> 04:06:00.540 align:start position:0%
place is shut down so we won't have a
 
04:06:02.090 --> 04:06:02.100 align:start position:0%
choice so uh other comments
 
04:06:04.550 --> 04:06:04.560 align:start position:0%
representative fellows so I I just it
 
04:06:07.010 --> 04:06:07.020 align:start position:0%
might be good to check with the people
 
04:06:08.269 --> 04:06:08.279 align:start position:0%
who are going to give us the
 
04:06:11.750 --> 04:06:11.760 align:start position:0%
presentations to make sure you know
 
04:06:16.610 --> 04:06:16.620 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:19.429 --> 04:06:19.439 align:start position:0%
well representative Southworth thank you
 
04:06:21.410 --> 04:06:21.420 align:start position:0%
I think the other thing would be on
 
04:06:21.420 --> 04:06:22.670 align:start position:0%
I think the other thing would be on
Wednesday

04:06:22.670 --> 04:06:22.680 align:start position:0%
Wednesday
 
04:06:24.889 --> 04:06:24.899 align:start position:0%
um just to dig in and do it and there
 
04:06:26.630 --> 04:06:26.640 align:start position:0%
may be other questions later on and as
 
04:06:28.490 --> 04:06:28.500 align:start position:0%
you said we can make adjustments later
 
04:06:30.950 --> 04:06:30.960 align:start position:0%
on but we really need to get the first
 
04:06:34.610 --> 04:06:34.620 align:start position:0%
group of estimates done Wednesday
 
04:06:36.590 --> 04:06:36.600 align:start position:0%
I agree with that and I honestly don't
 
04:06:38.210 --> 04:06:38.220 align:start position:0%
want to get too bogged down with more
 
04:06:40.910 --> 04:06:40.920 align:start position:0%
presentations I'm a little bit worried
 
04:06:42.530 --> 04:06:42.540 align:start position:0%
about that because if we end up like
 
04:06:45.170 --> 04:06:45.180 align:start position:0%
today we spend you know a solid amount
 
04:06:46.790 --> 04:06:46.800 align:start position:0%
of time
 
04:06:48.469 --> 04:06:48.479 align:start position:0%
you know I just want to eat up all of
 
04:06:50.269 --> 04:06:50.279 align:start position:0%
our day Wednesday we have a lot of
 
04:06:50.279 --> 04:06:51.229 align:start position:0%
our day Wednesday we have a lot of
information

04:06:51.229 --> 04:06:51.239 align:start position:0%
information
 
04:06:54.349 --> 04:06:54.359 align:start position:0%
we can write numbers How would how would
 
04:06:56.809 --> 04:06:56.819 align:start position:0%
the committee feel about being emailed
 
04:06:59.030 --> 04:06:59.040 align:start position:0%
from Department of Employment Security
 
04:07:00.590 --> 04:07:00.600 align:start position:0%
and the insurance department I'm sure
 
04:07:01.790 --> 04:07:01.800 align:start position:0%
they've already prepared their
 
04:07:04.130 --> 04:07:04.140 align:start position:0%
presentation if they were to email it to
 
04:07:05.630 --> 04:07:05.640 align:start position:0%
us yesterday so our homework for
 
04:07:09.050 --> 04:07:09.060 align:start position:0%
tomorrow would be to read it but how
 
04:07:10.370 --> 04:07:10.380 align:start position:0%
does that sound
 
04:07:14.210 --> 04:07:14.220 align:start position:0%
sounds good be a favor to them too
 
04:07:14.220 --> 04:07:19.610 align:start position:0%
sounds good be a favor to them too
but

04:07:19.610 --> 04:07:19.620 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:21.769 --> 04:07:21.779 align:start position:0%
so so is it the intent of the committee
 
04:07:24.410 --> 04:07:24.420 align:start position:0%
to ask the two agencies just to provide
 
04:07:26.170 --> 04:07:26.180 align:start position:0%
their written
 
04:07:28.969 --> 04:07:28.979 align:start position:0%
testimonial slides that would be emailed
 
04:07:30.590 --> 04:07:30.600 align:start position:0%
to the members but we wouldn't
 
04:07:31.910 --> 04:07:31.920 align:start position:0%
reschedule for them to actually come
 
04:07:33.349 --> 04:07:33.359 align:start position:0%
before the committee
 
04:07:34.790 --> 04:07:34.800 align:start position:0%
I think that's what we're leaning to
 
04:07:37.070 --> 04:07:37.080 align:start position:0%
representative and if there's a question
 
04:07:39.290 --> 04:07:39.300 align:start position:0%
that we have after reading that we can
 
04:07:41.809 --> 04:07:41.819 align:start position:0%
email them back
 
04:07:41.819 --> 04:07:43.490 align:start position:0%
email them back
yep

04:07:43.490 --> 04:07:43.500 align:start position:0%
yep
 
04:07:43.500 --> 04:07:44.889 align:start position:0%
yep
so

04:07:44.889 --> 04:07:44.899 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:07:48.590 --> 04:07:48.600 align:start position:0%
when is your deadline do you have to go
 
04:07:50.450 --> 04:07:50.460 align:start position:0%
to the finance committee at five o'clock
 
04:07:51.610 --> 04:07:51.620 align:start position:0%
on Wednesday
 
04:07:54.650 --> 04:07:54.660 align:start position:0%
uh no but it is my verbal commitment to
 
04:07:56.510 --> 04:07:56.520 align:start position:0%
the chair of finance and to the speaker
 
04:07:58.969 --> 04:07:58.979 align:start position:0%
that we would have it done on Wednesday
 
04:08:01.729 --> 04:08:01.739 align:start position:0%
so I would intend to but that's vague so
 
04:08:04.490 --> 04:08:04.500 align:start position:0%
yes oh wait wait no if we wanted to stay
 
04:08:06.290 --> 04:08:06.300 align:start position:0%
here and I could you know bring us some
 
04:08:07.610 --> 04:08:07.620 align:start position:0%
wine and we'll stay till seven I don't
 
04:08:09.830 --> 04:08:09.840 align:start position:0%
know uh but I'm sure most of you want to
 
04:08:12.710 --> 04:08:12.720 align:start position:0%
have a home life representative Ames
 
04:08:14.689 --> 04:08:14.699 align:start position:0%
well thank you um yeah it's just gonna
 
04:08:17.450 --> 04:08:17.460 align:start position:0%
chime in since I hadn't um that I think
 
04:08:20.269 --> 04:08:20.279 align:start position:0%
uh makes a lot of sense to uh
 
04:08:23.450 --> 04:08:23.460 align:start position:0%
to not come here on Tuesday get the
 
04:08:25.849 --> 04:08:25.859 align:start position:0%
written materials that we can get and
 
04:08:27.769 --> 04:08:27.779 align:start position:0%
think about all this stuff and come in
 
04:08:29.750 --> 04:08:29.760 align:start position:0%
on Wednesday and get the job done
 
04:08:29.760 --> 04:08:31.849 align:start position:0%
on Wednesday and get the job done
yeah

04:08:31.849 --> 04:08:31.859 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:34.429 --> 04:08:34.439 align:start position:0%
yeah I think that's the consensus then
 
04:08:37.429 --> 04:08:37.439 align:start position:0%
let's uh we'll cancel tomorrow I don't
 
04:08:38.689 --> 04:08:38.699 align:start position:0%
know how to do that officially because
 
04:08:40.429 --> 04:08:40.439 align:start position:0%
it's on the calendar
 
04:08:43.250 --> 04:08:43.260 align:start position:0%
oh I'll talk to Karen okay Karen can
 
04:08:45.530 --> 04:08:45.540 align:start position:0%
hopefully send out something so we will
 
04:08:47.090 --> 04:08:47.100 align:start position:0%
cancel tomorrow hopefully you're all
 
04:08:49.849 --> 04:08:49.859 align:start position:0%
safe at home and not driving and then
 
04:08:51.410 --> 04:08:51.420 align:start position:0%
but doing your homework doing your
 
04:08:53.750 --> 04:08:53.760 align:start position:0%
