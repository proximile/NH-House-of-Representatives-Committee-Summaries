discussion representative
 
00:10:57.310 --> 00:10:57.320 align:start position:0%
nder yes the um New England Electric
 
00:11:01.230 --> 00:11:01.240 align:start position:0%
Cooperative is owned by the members the
 
00:11:03.509 --> 00:11:03.519 align:start position:0%
the ones who use the utility or the ones
 
00:11:05.870 --> 00:11:05.880 align:start position:0%
who own the utility they're not for
 
00:11:10.230 --> 00:11:10.240 align:start position:0%
profit if they're a true democracy so if
 
00:11:12.710 --> 00:11:12.720 align:start position:0%
uh such a a measure was going to be made
 
00:11:14.870 --> 00:11:14.880 align:start position:0%
it should be made by the members of the
 
00:11:17.829 --> 00:11:17.839 align:start position:0%
utility to be deregulated would mean
 
00:11:20.350 --> 00:11:20.360 align:start position:0%
that the Pu would have to get involved
 
00:11:23.110 --> 00:11:23.120 align:start position:0%
and then higher additional staff and
 
00:11:24.990 --> 00:11:25.000 align:start position:0%
that the the cost would have to be
 
00:11:27.110 --> 00:11:27.120 align:start position:0%
recouped by the rate payers the
 
00:11:30.910 --> 00:11:30.920 align:start position:0%
estimated cost is over $600,000 so uh we
 
00:11:33.389 --> 00:11:33.399 align:start position:0%
should itl this Bill thank
 
00:11:36.710 --> 00:11:36.720 align:start position:0%

Thomas's intent in this bill uh
 
00:11:52.910 --> 00:11:52.920 align:start position:0%
not not to
 
00:11:56.910 --> 00:11:56.920 align:start position:0%
be uh a requirement
 
00:12:00.269 --> 00:12:00.279 align:start position:0%
that the co-op become re-regulated but
 
00:12:02.509 --> 00:12:02.519 align:start position:0%
rather that it was I I understood her
 
00:12:04.470 --> 00:12:04.480 align:start position:0%
bill to be more of sort of a a good
 
00:12:08.430 --> 00:12:08.440 align:start position:0%
government bill that would have required
 
00:12:12.150 --> 00:12:12.160 align:start position:0%
the co-op to sort of recertify
 
00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:14.750 align:start position:0%
the co-op to sort of recertify
itself

00:12:14.750 --> 00:12:14.760 align:start position:0%
itself
 
00:12:18.910 --> 00:12:18.920 align:start position:0%
um to restate and update the reg the
 
00:12:23.870 --> 00:12:23.880 align:start position:0%
reasons that they should U stay
 
00:12:26.790 --> 00:12:26.800 align:start position:0%
unregulated on a regular basis and I
 
00:12:30.629 --> 00:12:30.639 align:start position:0%
even looked at it as sort of a reason
 
00:12:32.590 --> 00:12:32.600 align:start position:0%
and a vehicle for the New Hampshire
 
00:12:36.829 --> 00:12:36.839 align:start position:0%
co-op to publish a report for all in the
 
00:12:38.670 --> 00:12:38.680 align:start position:0%
state to see including the other
 
00:12:43.550 --> 00:12:43.560 align:start position:0%
utilities and this committee and the
 
00:12:45.829 --> 00:12:45.839 align:start position:0%
public uh you
 
00:12:48.470 --> 00:12:48.480 align:start position:0%
know how and why they were able to do
 
00:12:51.269 --> 00:12:51.279 align:start position:0%
things so well for their
 
00:12:56.430 --> 00:12:56.440 align:start position:0%
members so um you know I'll be voting
 
00:12:58.550 --> 00:12:58.560 align:start position:0%
against the motion of it further
 
00:12:58.560 --> 00:13:02.949 align:start position:0%
against the motion of it further
discussion

00:13:02.949 --> 00:13:02.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:05.550 --> 00:13:05.560 align:start position:0%
representative Wendy Thomas thank you
 
00:13:09.150 --> 00:13:09.160 align:start position:0%
chair um New Hampshire requires a
 
00:13:10.910 --> 00:13:10.920 align:start position:0%
certificate of deregulation or
 
00:13:14.670 --> 00:13:14.680 align:start position:0%
regulation um for the for the uh for the
 
00:13:17.990 --> 00:13:18.000 align:start position:0%
co-op um the reason I filed this bill is
 
00:13:22.110 --> 00:13:22.120 align:start position:0%
I think it's good governance to update a
 
00:13:24.990 --> 00:13:25.000 align:start position:0%
required document more than every
 
00:13:27.470 --> 00:13:27.480 align:start position:0%
quarter of a century and it's been 24
 
00:13:31.310 --> 00:13:31.320 align:start position:0%
years since this last uh document was
 
00:13:34.269 --> 00:13:34.279 align:start position:0%
updated furthermore all of the testimony
 
00:13:37.269 --> 00:13:37.279 align:start position:0%
including the introduction to this uh
 
00:13:40.189 --> 00:13:40.199 align:start position:0%
motion uh talked about the price of
 
00:13:41.710 --> 00:13:41.720 align:start position:0%
going to
 
00:13:43.949 --> 00:13:43.959 align:start position:0%
regulation I was under the impression
 
00:13:46.069 --> 00:13:46.079 align:start position:0%
that the members were very happy with
 
00:13:48.829 --> 00:13:48.839 align:start position:0%
the way the co-op was being run right
 
00:13:52.550 --> 00:13:52.560 align:start position:0%
now and the fact that there is so much
 
00:13:55.150 --> 00:13:55.160 align:start position:0%
concern that the members might vote for
 
00:13:59.110 --> 00:13:59.120 align:start position:0%
regulation has raised flags for me and
 
00:14:00.670 --> 00:14:00.680 align:start position:0%
and I think that that makes this bill
 
00:14:02.829 --> 00:14:02.839 align:start position:0%
even more important thank
 
00:14:05.670 --> 00:14:05.680 align:start position:0%
you further
 
00:14:08.710 --> 00:14:08.720 align:start position:0%
discussion as a co-op member I
 
00:14:13.389 --> 00:14:13.399 align:start position:0%
will add my voice to this uh debate and
 
00:14:16.069 --> 00:14:16.079 align:start position:0%
suggest that we the members of the co-op
 
00:14:18.749 --> 00:14:18.759 align:start position:0%
are the ones who should determine how
 
00:14:20.629 --> 00:14:20.639 align:start position:0%
the co-op is
 
00:14:23.430 --> 00:14:23.440 align:start position:0%
run that's what a member owned
 
00:14:28.710 --> 00:14:28.720 align:start position:0%
organization does and we don't need to
 
00:14:33.470 --> 00:14:33.480 align:start position:0%
be scrutinized by outside influences or
 
00:14:33.480 --> 00:14:35.230 align:start position:0%
be scrutinized by outside influences or
outside

00:14:35.230 --> 00:14:35.240 align:start position:0%
outside
 
00:14:38.629 --> 00:14:38.639 align:start position:0%
entities so I think that itl is the only
 
00:14:41.310 --> 00:14:41.320 align:start position:0%
way to go with this bill to respect the
 
00:14:43.470 --> 00:14:43.480 align:start position:0%
wishes of the members of the
 
00:14:45.629 --> 00:14:45.639 align:start position:0%
co-op any further
 
00:14:48.590 --> 00:14:48.600 align:start position:0%
discussion representative McGee I'll
 
00:14:51.829 --> 00:14:51.839 align:start position:0%
just chime in because I think there are
 
00:14:54.470 --> 00:14:54.480 align:start position:0%
um differing opinions all all throughout
 
00:14:56.470 --> 00:14:56.480 align:start position:0%
the committee uh after hearing the
 
00:14:59.230 --> 00:14:59.240 align:start position:0%
testimony that we heard I'm not inclined
 
00:15:00.790 --> 00:15:00.800 align:start position:0%
to push this
 
00:15:03.550 --> 00:15:03.560 align:start position:0%
forward for my personally and I
 
00:15:05.829 --> 00:15:05.839 align:start position:0%
certainly do understand the position of
 
00:15:10.470 --> 00:15:10.480 align:start position:0%
my colleagues on my side um I uh
 
00:15:11.550 --> 00:15:11.560 align:start position:0%
understand that the position of the
 
00:15:14.710 --> 00:15:14.720 align:start position:0%
co-op is fairly unique in our Energy
 
00:15:18.829 --> 00:15:18.839 align:start position:0%
System and that uh their deregulated
 
00:15:20.230 --> 00:15:20.240 align:start position:0%
status is well understood and their
 
00:15:24.590 --> 00:15:24.600 align:start position:0%
nonprofit status is um other than CP cnh
 
00:15:26.550 --> 00:15:26.560 align:start position:0%
coming in you know it was a unique
 
00:15:29.949 --> 00:15:29.959 align:start position:0%
status for a very long time and so
 
00:15:33.269 --> 00:15:33.279 align:start position:0%
um while I think it is not a bad idea to
 
00:15:36.389 --> 00:15:36.399 align:start position:0%
have regular renewals um I think their
 
00:15:39.309 --> 00:15:39.319 align:start position:0%
status uh is is pretty well understood
 
00:15:42.870 --> 00:15:42.880 align:start position:0%
and so um their position really is that
 
00:15:45.350 --> 00:15:45.360 align:start position:0%
it's redundant for them to say we're
 
00:15:47.629 --> 00:15:47.639 align:start position:0%
we're deregulated because the whole
 
00:15:49.990 --> 00:15:50.000 align:start position:0%
premise of the way they're Incorporated
 
00:15:52.110 --> 00:15:52.120 align:start position:0%
is is that they're deregulated they're
 
00:15:55.030 --> 00:15:55.040 align:start position:0%
not a regulated utility so I'm I'm
 
00:15:57.749 --> 00:15:57.759 align:start position:0%
probably going to vote for the itl
 
00:15:59.710 --> 00:15:59.720 align:start position:0%
because I'm not sure that we
 
00:15:59.720 --> 00:16:00.590 align:start position:0%
because I'm not sure that we
you

00:16:00.590 --> 00:16:00.600 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:16:03.590 --> 00:16:03.600 align:start position:0%
know that it's going to be
 
00:16:05.870 --> 00:16:05.880 align:start position:0%
uh that
 
00:16:08.430 --> 00:16:08.440 align:start position:0%
it's I'll just leave it
 
00:16:10.590 --> 00:16:10.600 align:start position:0%
there okay further discussion
 
00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:11.910 align:start position:0%
there okay further discussion
representative

00:16:11.910 --> 00:16:11.920 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:16:16.550 --> 00:16:16.560 align:start position:0%
PL thank you chair um I second it as a
 
00:16:19.110 --> 00:16:19.120 align:start position:0%
member um things got brought up in
 
00:16:22.309 --> 00:16:22.319 align:start position:0%
testimony and here in executive session
 
00:16:22.319 --> 00:16:22.990 align:start position:0%
testimony and here in executive session
I

00:16:22.990 --> 00:16:23.000 align:start position:0%
I
 
00:16:26.269 --> 00:16:26.279 align:start position:0%
attended the last meeting that was
 
00:16:31.230 --> 00:16:31.240 align:start position:0%
mentioned and um Mr cre got he got
 
00:16:34.069 --> 00:16:34.079 align:start position:0%
involved in that by making suggestions I
 
00:16:37.189 --> 00:16:37.199 align:start position:0%
attended that meeting I saw difference
 
00:16:41.790 --> 00:16:41.800 align:start position:0%
of opinions from members and the board
 
00:16:42.710 --> 00:16:42.720 align:start position:0%
it was
 
00:16:42.720 --> 00:16:44.509 align:start position:0%
it was
handled

00:16:44.509 --> 00:16:44.519 align:start position:0%
handled
 
00:16:49.749 --> 00:16:49.759 align:start position:0%
civil um workers members we were all
 
00:16:52.749 --> 00:16:52.759 align:start position:0%
there it was handled like any other
 
00:16:55.470 --> 00:16:55.480 align:start position:0%
business went on we have another board
 
00:16:59.749 --> 00:16:59.759 align:start position:0%
of directors um because of
 
00:17:02.990 --> 00:17:03.000 align:start position:0%
resignations and uh one other thing the
 
00:17:05.390 --> 00:17:05.400 align:start position:0%
petitions there have been
 
00:17:08.029 --> 00:17:08.039 align:start position:0%
petitions when members are disg grunted
 
00:17:10.510 --> 00:17:10.520 align:start position:0%
it does not take that many members I'm
 
00:17:13.350 --> 00:17:13.360 align:start position:0%
not sure what the count is right today
 
00:17:16.270 --> 00:17:16.280 align:start position:0%
to put in a petition to deregulate if
 
00:17:16.280 --> 00:17:16.990 align:start position:0%
to put in a petition to deregulate if
the

00:17:16.990 --> 00:17:17.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:17:21.029 --> 00:17:21.039 align:start position:0%
membership so feels in 25 years there
 
00:17:24.230 --> 00:17:24.240 align:start position:0%
has not been a petition that I know of
 
00:17:27.429 --> 00:17:27.439 align:start position:0%
that met the minimum requirements of
 
00:17:31.110 --> 00:17:31.120 align:start position:0%
signatures so I will be voting my second
 
00:17:34.750 --> 00:17:34.760 align:start position:0%
to itl thank you further discussion
 
00:17:37.430 --> 00:17:37.440 align:start position:0%
representative Thomas Thomas thank you
 
00:17:40.470 --> 00:17:40.480 align:start position:0%
Mr chair I just want to add my uh
 
00:17:43.870 --> 00:17:43.880 align:start position:0%
concurrence that I plan to vote uh for
 
00:17:47.270 --> 00:17:47.280 align:start position:0%
itl based on uh the evidence that we
 
00:17:49.990 --> 00:17:50.000 align:start position:0%
heard and the fact that uh if I'm using
 
00:17:54.950 --> 00:17:54.960 align:start position:0%
an old military uh col cism uh it seems
 
00:17:58.230 --> 00:17:58.240 align:start position:0%
like U the co-op has functioned as
 
00:18:01.070 --> 00:18:01.080 align:start position:0%
designed they had meetings they had
 
00:18:03.669 --> 00:18:03.679 align:start position:0%
members that voiced their opinion and
 
00:18:07.590 --> 00:18:07.600 align:start position:0%
the process indicates that members still
 
00:18:11.110 --> 00:18:11.120 align:start position:0%
want to be unregulated and the to have
 
00:18:14.149 --> 00:18:14.159 align:start position:0%
the legislature involved in mandating a
 
00:18:16.750 --> 00:18:16.760 align:start position:0%
periodic review which is timely and can
 
00:18:21.149 --> 00:18:21.159 align:start position:0%
cost some uh seems um redundant and not
 
00:18:23.789 --> 00:18:23.799 align:start position:0%
in the faith of the uh of the way the
 
00:18:25.950 --> 00:18:25.960 align:start position:0%
co-op is run by its member board so for
 
00:18:29.549 --> 00:18:29.559 align:start position:0%
those reasons I support itl
 
00:18:31.909 --> 00:18:31.919 align:start position:0%
further discussion representative Corman
 
00:18:34.310 --> 00:18:34.320 align:start position:0%
thank you uh I actually will be voting
 
00:18:38.070 --> 00:18:38.080 align:start position:0%
for the motion um I understand the
 
00:18:39.909 --> 00:18:39.919 align:start position:0%
concept behind the bill and I appreciate
 
00:18:41.990 --> 00:18:42.000 align:start position:0%
it but it it's uh we heard during
 
00:18:44.430 --> 00:18:44.440 align:start position:0%
testimony that members can actually
 
00:18:46.870 --> 00:18:46.880 align:start position:0%
revisit deregulation during the annual
 
00:18:49.230 --> 00:18:49.240 align:start position:0%
election each year so if there really is
 
00:18:53.430 --> 00:18:53.440 align:start position:0%
a move to um uh regulate members do have
 
00:18:56.430 --> 00:18:56.440 align:start position:0%
that power so I'll be voting for the
 
00:19:00.630 --> 00:19:00.640 align:start position:0%
motion further discussion
 
00:19:02.230 --> 00:19:02.240 align:start position:0%

and the chair recognizes Vice chair
 
00:21:18.390 --> 00:21:18.400 align:start position:0%
Thomas for a motion thank you Mr chair I
 
00:21:25.669 --> 00:21:25.679 align:start position:0%
motion to adopt uh Amendment 2025 d01
 
00:21:28.789 --> 00:21:28.799 align:start position:0%
05h and um I'll wait to speak to the
 
00:21:30.390 --> 00:21:30.400 align:start position:0%
amendment chair recognizes
 
00:21:32.510 --> 00:21:32.520 align:start position:0%
representative bernardy second the
 
00:21:35.750 --> 00:21:35.760 align:start position:0%
motion moved and seconded that we adopt
 
00:21:58.950 --> 00:21:58.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:02.070 --> 00:22:02.080 align:start position:0%
and uh I said I would entertain
 
00:22:06.110 --> 00:22:06.120 align:start position:0%
discussion on some changes to my uh my
 
00:22:09.549 --> 00:22:09.559 align:start position:0%
bill which we we looked into and this
 
00:22:12.669 --> 00:22:12.679 align:start position:0%
amendment incorporates uh the intent of
 
00:22:16.029 --> 00:22:16.039 align:start position:0%
that discussion by adding low greenhouse
 
00:22:19.470 --> 00:22:19.480 align:start position:0%
gas emitting sources as part of clean
 
00:22:23.110 --> 00:22:23.120 align:start position:0%
energy definition including nuclear and
 
00:22:25.549 --> 00:22:25.559 align:start position:0%
other renewable sources I believe that
 
00:22:28.510 --> 00:22:28.520 align:start position:0%
covers the intent of uh the cons
 
00:22:31.789 --> 00:22:31.799 align:start position:0%
concerns of how we Define clean energy
 
00:22:35.350 --> 00:22:35.360 align:start position:0%
therefore um with that definition uh the
 
00:22:39.430 --> 00:22:39.440 align:start position:0%
second part of the amendment to um place
 
00:22:42.870 --> 00:22:42.880 align:start position:0%
the word clean energy and uh uh
 
00:22:45.390 --> 00:22:45.400 align:start position:0%
Diversified fuels under the 10-year
 
00:22:48.470 --> 00:22:48.480 align:start position:0%
strategy plan holds and would go back up
 
00:22:51.110 --> 00:22:51.120 align:start position:0%
to the the uh the overall definition for
 
00:22:53.590 --> 00:22:53.600 align:start position:0%
clean energy and one thing that we that
 
00:22:55.310 --> 00:22:55.320 align:start position:0%
we forgot to mention during public
 
00:22:57.990 --> 00:22:58.000 align:start position:0%
hearing but as was explicitly stated
 
00:23:00.750 --> 00:23:00.760 align:start position:0%
this all o covers a housekeeping rule to
 
00:23:03.390 --> 00:23:03.400 align:start position:0%
eliminate the reference to the uh easy
 
00:23:05.669 --> 00:23:05.679 align:start position:0%
board which is now defunct so that's
 
00:23:07.710 --> 00:23:07.720 align:start position:0%
just a housekeeping measure as
 
00:23:09.990 --> 00:23:10.000 align:start position:0%
well discussion on the amendment
 
00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:11.190 align:start position:0%
well discussion on the amendment
representative

00:23:11.190 --> 00:23:11.200 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:23:15.430 --> 00:23:15.440 align:start position:0%
Corman thank you Mr chairman um so this
 
00:23:16.830 --> 00:23:16.840 align:start position:0%
amendment is different from the one that
 
00:23:18.630 --> 00:23:18.640 align:start position:0%
we saw uh
 
00:23:21.430 --> 00:23:21.440 align:start position:0%
yesterday and this one says clean energy
 
00:23:23.909 --> 00:23:23.919 align:start position:0%
means low greenhouse gas emitting
 
00:23:27.269 --> 00:23:27.279 align:start position:0%
sources not zero greenhouse gas emitting
 
00:23:30.950 --> 00:23:30.960 align:start position:0%
sources and and I'm I'm concerned
 
00:23:33.669 --> 00:23:33.679 align:start position:0%
about the lack of definition of what is
 
00:23:37.029 --> 00:23:37.039 align:start position:0%
low greenhouse gas emitting does that
 
00:23:40.549 --> 00:23:40.559 align:start position:0%
include natural gas for example and it's
 
00:23:41.630 --> 00:23:41.640 align:start position:0%
just it's
 
00:23:43.750 --> 00:23:43.760 align:start position:0%
undefined so you know what does it mean
 
00:23:46.870 --> 00:23:46.880 align:start position:0%
to be low greenhouse gas emitting so I'm
 
00:23:49.070 --> 00:23:49.080 align:start position:0%
I'm not in favor of the this amendment
 
00:23:51.870 --> 00:23:51.880 align:start position:0%
as as written the one that we got
 
00:23:54.549 --> 00:23:54.559 align:start position:0%
yesterday um I actually would have voted
 
00:23:58.149 --> 00:23:58.159 align:start position:0%
for but this one uh I I can't vote for
 
00:24:01.470 --> 00:24:01.480 align:start position:0%
because because it's I think not clearly
 
00:24:04.630 --> 00:24:04.640 align:start position:0%
defined and I don't consider natural gas
 
00:24:07.269 --> 00:24:07.279 align:start position:0%
to be clean energy I think of it as less
 
00:24:09.149 --> 00:24:09.159 align:start position:0%
dirty energy but I don't think of it as
 
00:24:09.159 --> 00:24:10.390 align:start position:0%
dirty energy but I don't think of it as
clean

00:24:10.390 --> 00:24:10.400 align:start position:0%

00:24:18.190 --> 00:24:18.200 align:start position:0%
bernardy yeah I I think the uh the
 
00:24:21.070 --> 00:24:21.080 align:start position:0%
rationale for using the word low versus
 
00:24:24.310 --> 00:24:24.320 align:start position:0%
no is because things like
 
00:24:27.870 --> 00:24:27.880 align:start position:0%
windmills uh have uh diesel or gas
 
00:24:27.880 --> 00:24:29.110 align:start position:0%
windmills uh have uh diesel or gas
engine

00:24:29.110 --> 00:24:29.120 align:start position:0%
engine
 
00:24:32.870 --> 00:24:32.880 align:start position:0%
on board in order to start them from a
 
00:24:35.549 --> 00:24:35.559 align:start position:0%
dead stop when the wind isn't blowing
 
00:24:38.269 --> 00:24:38.279 align:start position:0%
and then starts picking up so they are
 
00:24:42.350 --> 00:24:42.360 align:start position:0%
not zero emitting they emit a certain
 
00:24:48.350 --> 00:24:48.360 align:start position:0%
amount of uh greenhouse gas so
 
00:24:52.190 --> 00:24:52.200 align:start position:0%
you unless we're going to get into
 
00:24:56.590 --> 00:24:56.600 align:start position:0%
real uh semantics on what low versus no
 
00:25:01.029 --> 00:25:01.039 align:start position:0%
means um this is probably the best

Thomas thank you Mr chairman um well uh
 
00:25:09.310 --> 00:25:09.320 align:start position:0%
this was a result of the discussion we
 
00:25:12.909 --> 00:25:12.919 align:start position:0%
had yesterday and trying to um entertain
 
00:25:16.950 --> 00:25:16.960 align:start position:0%
the concerns at the time we uh my intent
 
00:25:18.990 --> 00:25:19.000 align:start position:0%
for this change was the fact that we
 
00:25:21.590 --> 00:25:21.600 align:start position:0%
didn't really mention hydrogen and so it
 
00:25:24.230 --> 00:25:24.240 align:start position:0%
was the hydrogen is what we were
 
00:25:26.350 --> 00:25:26.360 align:start position:0%
thinking of when we went to low low
 
00:25:28.950 --> 00:25:28.960 align:start position:0%
emission uh you know sources so in our
 
00:25:31.430 --> 00:25:31.440 align:start position:0%
efforts to uh to make sure we
 
00:25:34.510 --> 00:25:34.520 align:start position:0%
incorporated that type of potential fuel
 
00:25:37.350 --> 00:25:37.360 align:start position:0%
is why we came up with this
 
00:25:39.350 --> 00:25:39.360 align:start position:0%
definition further discussion
 
00:25:42.190 --> 00:25:42.200 align:start position:0%
representative McGee thank you Mr chair
 
00:25:45.350 --> 00:25:45.360 align:start position:0%
and thank you Mr Vice chair for um
 
00:25:48.310 --> 00:25:48.320 align:start position:0%
accommodating me in uh the discussion
 
00:25:49.590 --> 00:25:49.600 align:start position:0%
that I thought the original language
 
00:25:51.590 --> 00:25:51.600 align:start position:0%
wasn't broad enough to capture our
 
00:25:54.070 --> 00:25:54.080 align:start position:0%
intent of defining clean energy for the
 
00:25:56.789 --> 00:25:56.799 align:start position:0%
State of New Hampshire um what I wanted
 
00:25:59.470 --> 00:25:59.480 align:start position:0%
to say about this particular language is
 
00:26:01.909 --> 00:26:01.919 align:start position:0%
similar to what's been said already what
 
00:26:05.110 --> 00:26:05.120 align:start position:0%
I had asked for yesterday was that clean
 
00:26:07.590 --> 00:26:07.600 align:start position:0%
energy uh the term clean energy be
 
00:26:10.149 --> 00:26:10.159 align:start position:0%
defined as non-greenhouse gas emitting
 
00:26:14.070 --> 00:26:14.080 align:start position:0%
sources and non-greenhouse gas emitting
 
00:26:19.350 --> 00:26:19.360 align:start position:0%
sources is a a sort of a it's a
 
00:26:21.710 --> 00:26:21.720 align:start position:0%
nomenclature that's used in many
 
00:26:23.870 --> 00:26:23.880 align:start position:0%
statutes around the country
 
00:26:26.230 --> 00:26:26.240 align:start position:0%
non-greenhouse gas emitting sources
 
00:26:29.190 --> 00:26:29.200 align:start position:0%
means that they don't create
 
00:26:32.510 --> 00:26:32.520 align:start position:0%
they don't create emissions by their use
 
00:26:34.950 --> 00:26:34.960 align:start position:0%
right so that doesn't mean that um you
 
00:26:37.149 --> 00:26:37.159 align:start position:0%
know in the example that representative
 
00:26:39.990 --> 00:26:40.000 align:start position:0%
Bernardi gave there may be still some
 
00:26:43.269 --> 00:26:43.279 align:start position:0%
dependencies on fossil fuels for aspects
 
00:26:45.470 --> 00:26:45.480 align:start position:0%
of production but when they're actually
 
00:26:47.430 --> 00:26:47.440 align:start position:0%
in use producing The energy they produce
 
00:26:51.070 --> 00:26:51.080 align:start position:0%
they don't Emit and so it is very
 
00:26:53.750 --> 00:26:53.760 align:start position:0%
important that we get the language right
 
00:26:56.990 --> 00:26:57.000 align:start position:0%
because there are many other statutes
 
00:27:00.230 --> 00:27:00.240 align:start position:0%
that will refer back to what are we
 
00:27:03.950 --> 00:27:03.960 align:start position:0%
talking about um our renewable energy
 
00:27:05.990 --> 00:27:06.000 align:start position:0%
credits and the people you know the the
 
00:27:07.909 --> 00:27:07.919 align:start position:0%
types of resources that we have now that
 
00:27:11.510 --> 00:27:11.520 align:start position:0%
depend on those um I I feel like first
 
00:27:14.430 --> 00:27:14.440 align:start position:0%
Do no harm and it so I think we should
 
00:27:17.750 --> 00:27:17.760 align:start position:0%
get this right and if this amendment
 
00:27:19.990 --> 00:27:20.000 align:start position:0%
doesn't satisfy that because it's now
 
00:27:22.630 --> 00:27:22.640 align:start position:0%
including low greenhouse gas emitting
 
00:27:24.990 --> 00:27:25.000 align:start position:0%
sources as clean which changes the
 
00:27:27.029 --> 00:27:27.039 align:start position:0%
definition completely for even the
 
00:27:29.269 --> 00:27:29.279 align:start position:0%
reason that we would have a clean energy
 
00:27:35.029 --> 00:27:35.039 align:start position:0%
definition um and uh yeah so I think it
 
00:27:37.230 --> 00:27:37.240 align:start position:0%
doesn't do what it is we were asking it
 
00:27:40.310 --> 00:27:40.320 align:start position:0%
to do and the whole reason I brought up
 
00:27:41.750 --> 00:27:41.760 align:start position:0%
the fact that I didn't think it met the
 
00:27:43.590 --> 00:27:43.600 align:start position:0%
intent was that I wanted us to get it
 
00:27:47.630 --> 00:27:47.640 align:start position:0%
right so again what I had mentioned was
 
00:27:50.110 --> 00:27:50.120 align:start position:0%
non-greenhouse gas emitting sources
 
00:27:52.230 --> 00:27:52.240 align:start position:0%
because it's a well-defined term that
 
00:27:53.990 --> 00:27:54.000 align:start position:0%
people and people understand what's
 
00:27:55.669 --> 00:27:55.679 align:start position:0%
included in that and nuclear is included
 
00:27:58.750 --> 00:27:58.760 align:start position:0%
in that um so most of the clean energy
 
00:28:01.029 --> 00:28:01.039 align:start position:0%
standards that you see being adopted
 
00:28:02.070 --> 00:28:02.080 align:start position:0%
around the
 
00:28:04.950 --> 00:28:04.960 align:start position:0%
country refer to non-greenhouse gas
 
00:28:08.430 --> 00:28:08.440 align:start position:0%
emitting sources so that's what I think
 
00:28:10.950 --> 00:28:10.960 align:start position:0%
it should be further
 
00:28:13.430 --> 00:28:13.440 align:start position:0%
discussion representative
 
00:28:17.710 --> 00:28:17.720 align:start position:0%
ner thank you Mr chairman um wind and
 
00:28:20.230 --> 00:28:20.240 align:start position:0%
solar cannot be manufactured without the
 
00:28:21.590 --> 00:28:21.600 align:start position:0%
use of fossil
 
00:28:25.470 --> 00:28:25.480 align:start position:0%
fuels there's coal plants going up every
 
00:28:27.870 --> 00:28:27.880 align:start position:0%
month every week in uh in China to to
 
00:28:30.590 --> 00:28:30.600 align:start position:0%
make these components wind and solar
 
00:28:33.630 --> 00:28:33.640 align:start position:0%
cannot replace fossil fuel but nuclear
 
00:28:37.630 --> 00:28:37.640 align:start position:0%
can and nuclear is net zero um so I
 
00:28:39.389 --> 00:28:39.399 align:start position:0%
support the the amendment oh also
 
00:28:40.909 --> 00:28:40.919 align:start position:0%
interesting to note that in the state of
 
00:28:43.470 --> 00:28:43.480 align:start position:0%
Ohio they include natural gas in their
 
00:28:45.789 --> 00:28:45.799 align:start position:0%
definition of clean energy that'll never
 
00:28:48.190 --> 00:28:48.200 align:start position:0%
happen here but still interesting to
 
00:28:51.230 --> 00:28:51.240 align:start position:0%
note representative Swanson had a
 
00:28:53.630 --> 00:28:53.640 align:start position:0%
comment thank you uh representative
 
00:28:55.830 --> 00:28:55.840 align:start position:0%
Bernard you had a good point uh if there
 
00:28:57.669 --> 00:28:57.679 align:start position:0%
are generators that are needed to start
 
00:29:00.110 --> 00:29:00.120 align:start position:0%
the window Mills But ultimately I feel
 
00:29:04.470 --> 00:29:04.480 align:start position:0%
like uh and and a good point as far as
 
00:29:08.509 --> 00:29:08.519 align:start position:0%
yes uh I do believe that uh that nuclear
 
00:29:11.789 --> 00:29:11.799 align:start position:0%
solar and wind can potentially replace
 
00:29:14.470 --> 00:29:14.480 align:start position:0%
fossil fuel in the future it will take a
 
00:29:16.830 --> 00:29:16.840 align:start position:0%
bit of a transition but I feel that the
 
00:29:20.470 --> 00:29:20.480 align:start position:0%
the low greenhouse gas term is just too
 
00:29:24.230 --> 00:29:24.240 align:start position:0%
vague and uh so this shouldn't be
 
00:29:26.389 --> 00:29:26.399 align:start position:0%
supported any additional comment
 
00:29:28.750 --> 00:29:28.760 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington you just to
 
00:29:31.190 --> 00:29:31.200 align:start position:0%
clarify uh the same issue applies with
 
00:29:33.630 --> 00:29:33.640 align:start position:0%
nuclear except on a much larger scale
 
00:29:35.630 --> 00:29:35.640 align:start position:0%
when a nuclear plan is starting up they
 
00:29:38.070 --> 00:29:38.080 align:start position:0%
either they generally will use grid
 
00:29:39.909 --> 00:29:39.919 align:start position:0%
supplied power which in New England is
 
00:29:43.149 --> 00:29:43.159 align:start position:0%
about 50% natural gas and it's a
 
00:29:44.909 --> 00:29:44.919 align:start position:0%
substantial amount of power because you
 
00:29:46.870 --> 00:29:46.880 align:start position:0%
have to heat up the plant operating
 
00:29:48.269 --> 00:29:48.279 align:start position:0%
temperature by running the reactor
 
00:29:52.269 --> 00:29:52.279 align:start position:0%
coolant pump and uh so they they do use
 
00:29:55.549 --> 00:29:55.559 align:start position:0%
in cause emission of fossil fuels um
 
00:29:58.950 --> 00:29:58.960 align:start position:0%
just so people are aware of that
 
00:30:00.669 --> 00:30:00.679 align:start position:0%
additional comment representative
 
00:30:02.909 --> 00:30:02.919 align:start position:0%
Summers thank you Mr chairman I'd just
 
00:30:06.669 --> 00:30:06.679 align:start position:0%
like to add that uh um being here two
 
00:30:10.549 --> 00:30:10.559 align:start position:0%
things being here in the term 2010 2012
 
00:30:14.149 --> 00:30:14.159 align:start position:0%
um natural gas was being pushed by both
 
00:30:16.710 --> 00:30:16.720 align:start position:0%
sides of the legislature as clean energy
 
00:30:18.669 --> 00:30:18.679 align:start position:0%
back then granted A lot's changed over
 
00:30:21.310 --> 00:30:21.320 align:start position:0%
the last 13 14 years but that was
 
00:30:23.190 --> 00:30:23.200 align:start position:0%
actually being pushed to be spread more
 
00:30:25.950 --> 00:30:25.960 align:start position:0%
throughout New Hampshire now as far as
 
00:30:28.190 --> 00:30:28.200 align:start position:0%
uh cleanergy I'd like to go back to to
 
00:30:30.549 --> 00:30:30.559 align:start position:0%
last term where we had actually a bill
 
00:30:33.029 --> 00:30:33.039 align:start position:0%
on green that kind of ties to this with
 
00:30:37.070 --> 00:30:37.080 align:start position:0%
the green um hydrogen and while green
 
00:30:38.710 --> 00:30:38.720 align:start position:0%
hydrogen was being pushed in the bill we
 
00:30:41.630 --> 00:30:41.640 align:start position:0%
kind of came to a consensus bipartisan I
 
00:30:44.070 --> 00:30:44.080 align:start position:0%
believe that all types of hydrogen
 
00:30:47.350 --> 00:30:47.360 align:start position:0%
whether it' be green purple or gray
 
00:30:50.789 --> 00:30:50.799 align:start position:0%
would be um thought thought it would be
 
00:30:52.549 --> 00:30:52.559 align:start position:0%
efficient as long as you be able to
 
00:30:54.509 --> 00:30:54.519 align:start position:0%
produce into a hydrogen base then you
 
00:30:56.710 --> 00:30:56.720 align:start position:0%
get zero so you'd have to start out with
 
00:30:58.990 --> 00:30:59.000 align:start position:0%
again a low base to get to it's kind of
 
00:31:00.230 --> 00:31:00.240 align:start position:0%
like the windmill example that
 
00:31:02.070 --> 00:31:02.080 align:start position:0%
representative Bernardi used you have to
 
00:31:04.509 --> 00:31:04.519 align:start position:0%
use a low base carbon to be able to get
 
00:31:07.750 --> 00:31:07.760 align:start position:0%
to the zero base hydrogen that devices
 
00:31:10.310 --> 00:31:10.320 align:start position:0%
or equipment Implement would use so
 
00:31:13.029 --> 00:31:13.039 align:start position:0%
therefore I do see the wording for low
 
00:31:15.870 --> 00:31:15.880 align:start position:0%
and maybe defining it a certain way to
 
00:31:17.590 --> 00:31:17.600 align:start position:0%
meet certain expectations on the
 
00:31:20.590 --> 00:31:20.600 align:start position:0%
development but um yeah I agree with the
 
00:31:23.629 --> 00:31:23.639 align:start position:0%
the amendment is written
 
00:31:25.950 --> 00:31:25.960 align:start position:0%
thanks representative
 
00:31:28.830 --> 00:31:28.840 align:start position:0%

00:31:34.590 --> 00:31:34.600 align:start position:0%
Thomas and
 
00:31:38.750 --> 00:31:38.760 align:start position:0%
um represent Summers the hydrogen green
 
00:31:42.750 --> 00:31:42.760 align:start position:0%
hydrogen when it is used it combusts
 
00:31:46.909 --> 00:31:46.919 align:start position:0%
into water vapor which is the most
 
00:31:50.269 --> 00:31:50.279 align:start position:0%
um absorbing of the three greenhouse
 
00:31:54.710 --> 00:31:54.720 align:start position:0%
gases methane and cl too so it if we're
 
00:31:57.430 --> 00:31:57.440 align:start position:0%
planning to look into hydrogen we need a
 
00:31:57.440 --> 00:31:58.430 align:start position:0%
planning to look into hydrogen we need a
low

00:31:58.430 --> 00:31:58.440 align:start position:0%

um

00:32:04.430 --> 00:32:04.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:08.269 --> 00:32:08.279 align:start position:0%
CO2 thank you representative
 
00:32:11.230 --> 00:32:11.240 align:start position:0%
rolds thank you Mr chairman uh try to be
 
00:32:13.269 --> 00:32:13.279 align:start position:0%
brief here
 
00:32:16.430 --> 00:32:16.440 align:start position:0%
um you know
 
00:32:19.549 --> 00:32:19.559 align:start position:0%
dependencies for manufacturing or
 
00:32:22.909 --> 00:32:22.919 align:start position:0%
perhaps startup are are well known and
 
00:32:24.389 --> 00:32:24.399 align:start position:0%
and are commonly
 
00:32:26.549 --> 00:32:26.559 align:start position:0%
understood um you know we live in a
 
00:32:29.750 --> 00:32:29.760 align:start position:0%
world today large powered by fossil
 
00:32:29.760 --> 00:32:31.269 align:start position:0%
world today large powered by fossil
fuels

00:32:31.269 --> 00:32:31.279 align:start position:0%
fuels
 
00:32:35.149 --> 00:32:35.159 align:start position:0%
uh that's that's not in in debate uh but
 
00:32:37.870 --> 00:32:37.880 align:start position:0%
this is a bill in which we are this the
 
00:32:41.029 --> 00:32:41.039 align:start position:0%
point of this bill is to Define clean
 
00:32:43.110 --> 00:32:43.120 align:start position:0%
energy so the last thing we ought to be
 
00:32:45.629 --> 00:32:45.639 align:start position:0%
doing is passing an amendment in a bill
 
00:32:48.430 --> 00:32:48.440 align:start position:0%
that attempts to Define clean energy but
 
00:32:50.870 --> 00:32:50.880 align:start position:0%
yet includes another
 
00:32:53.789 --> 00:32:53.799 align:start position:0%
term now
 
00:32:57.110 --> 00:32:57.120 align:start position:0%
low greenhouse gas emitting in which
 
00:33:00.070 --> 00:33:00.080 align:start position:0%
there apparently are are widely even
 
00:33:02.070 --> 00:33:02.080 align:start position:0%
among this discussion we're having you
 
00:33:04.029 --> 00:33:04.039 align:start position:0%
know differing interpretations of what
 
00:33:07.310 --> 00:33:07.320 align:start position:0%
low emitting means you know I want to go
 
00:33:09.990 --> 00:33:10.000 align:start position:0%
back to what representative McGee
 
00:33:13.710 --> 00:33:13.720 align:start position:0%
said about the term non non-greenhouse
 
00:33:16.509 --> 00:33:16.519 align:start position:0%
gas emitting being a commonly used term
 
00:33:19.750 --> 00:33:19.760 align:start position:0%
to refer to the sources of energy that
 
00:33:22.029 --> 00:33:22.039 align:start position:0%
when they are operating the conversion
 
00:33:23.830 --> 00:33:23.840 align:start position:0%
that they're doing of energy is
 
00:33:26.870 --> 00:33:26.880 align:start position:0%
non-emitting and so we should be using
 
00:33:30.470 --> 00:33:30.480 align:start position:0%
non- Greenhouse gas emitting not
 
00:33:33.190 --> 00:33:33.200 align:start position:0%
low a widely used term that's not
 
00:33:36.310 --> 00:33:36.320 align:start position:0%
correct would be problematic I would
 
00:33:39.269 --> 00:33:39.279 align:start position:0%
think we need to move along so
 
00:33:41.549 --> 00:33:41.559 align:start position:0%
representative Kaplan gets the last word
 
00:33:44.549 --> 00:33:44.559 align:start position:0%
here yeah thank you Mr chair and you
 
00:33:46.509 --> 00:33:46.519 align:start position:0%
know it it seems like we want to have a
 
00:33:48.070 --> 00:33:48.080 align:start position:0%
tighter definition of what greenhouse
 
00:33:49.990 --> 00:33:50.000 align:start position:0%
gas or what greenhouse gas or
 
00:33:51.669 --> 00:33:51.679 align:start position:0%
non-greenhouse gas emitting sources
 
00:33:53.870 --> 00:33:53.880 align:start position:0%
would be and from this discussion it
 
00:33:55.590 --> 00:33:55.600 align:start position:0%
seems clear that that
 
00:33:58.190 --> 00:33:58.200 align:start position:0%
would you know for our purposes it would
 
00:34:00.669 --> 00:34:00.679 align:start position:0%
mean non-greenhouse gas emitting during
 
00:34:03.269 --> 00:34:03.279 align:start position:0%
operational times and of low duration in
 
00:34:05.509 --> 00:34:05.519 align:start position:0%
the atmosphere because yeah water vapor
 
00:34:08.109 --> 00:34:08.119 align:start position:0%
is is a greenhouse gas but it lasts such
 
00:34:10.349 --> 00:34:10.359 align:start position:0%
a little time that it actually has no
 
00:34:13.430 --> 00:34:13.440 align:start position:0%
impact on you know on the on on the on
 
00:34:14.909 --> 00:34:14.919 align:start position:0%
the warming which is what we're
 
00:34:17.629 --> 00:34:17.639 align:start position:0%
concerned about so I mean that would be
 
00:34:19.589 --> 00:34:19.599 align:start position:0%
a a simp if we want to be really precise
 
00:34:21.069 --> 00:34:21.079 align:start position:0%
that would be a very simple Amendment we
 
00:34:22.869 --> 00:34:22.879 align:start position:0%
could say non greenhouse gas emitting
 
00:34:25.349 --> 00:34:25.359 align:start position:0%
during operational times and of low
 
00:34:29.310 --> 00:34:29.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:31.109 --> 00:34:31.119 align:start position:0%
all right I think we can uh I think
 
00:34:33.030 --> 00:34:33.040 align:start position:0%
we've all had a chance to State our
 
00:34:34.829 --> 00:34:34.839 align:start position:0%
position on this so I'm going to ask the
 
00:34:36.389 --> 00:34:36.399 align:start position:0%
clerk to call the role on the question
 
00:34:42.389 --> 00:34:42.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:46.270 --> 00:34:46.280 align:start position:0%
015h and uh based on the discussion I
 
00:34:52.030 --> 00:34:52.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:55.310 --> 00:34:55.320 align:start position:0%
call so I had discussed with the clerk
 
00:34:56.990 --> 00:34:57.000 align:start position:0%
the possibility of adopting this
 
00:34:59.230 --> 00:34:59.240 align:start position:0%
amendment with a show of
 
00:35:02.990 --> 00:35:03.000 align:start position:0%
hands and he did not prepare a roll call
 
00:35:06.190 --> 00:35:06.200 align:start position:0%
sheet as a result so it's going to take
 
00:35:10.230 --> 00:35:10.240 align:start position:0%
him a minute to get uh established
 
00:35:14.150 --> 00:35:14.160 align:start position:0%
here Vice chair Thomas yes

it okay let's uh I'll ask the clerk to
 
00:36:43.069 --> 00:36:43.079 align:start position:0%
call the road then on the question of
 
00:36:45.190 --> 00:36:45.200 align:start position:0%
oop pass chair I just deferred to Tom
 
00:36:46.670 --> 00:36:46.680 align:start position:0%

the bill as amended but I will be voting
 
00:37:07.950 --> 00:37:07.960 align:start position:0%
against the bill with the amendment that
 
00:37:07.960 --> 00:37:09.150 align:start position:0%
against the bill with the amendment that
just

00:37:09.150 --> 00:37:09.160 align:start position:0%
just
 
00:37:11.990 --> 00:37:12.000 align:start position:0%
passed okay with that I'll ask the clerk
 
00:37:13.550 --> 00:37:13.560 align:start position:0%
to call the role in the question about

hb89 representative Vice chair Thomas
 
00:38:27.870 --> 00:38:27.880 align:start position:0%
will write the majority report rep will
 
00:38:30.349 --> 00:38:30.359 align:start position:0%
there be a Minority Report there will be
 
00:38:32.910 --> 00:38:32.920 align:start position:0%
and I I'll be writing it representative
 
00:38:35.390 --> 00:38:35.400 align:start position:0%
McGee will write
 
00:38:38.630 --> 00:38:38.640 align:start position:0%
the majority report I mean Minority
 
00:38:42.270 --> 00:38:42.280 align:start position:0%
Report and I need that by 7 amm tomorrow
 
00:38:44.870 --> 00:38:44.880 align:start position:0%
please and with that we will close the
 
00:38:47.870 --> 00:38:47.880 align:start position:0%
exact session on House Bill
 
00:38:50.990 --> 00:38:51.000 align:start position:0%
189 and immediately open an exact
 
00:38:53.550 --> 00:38:53.560 align:start position:0%
session on House Bill
 
00:38:56.270 --> 00:38:56.280 align:start position:0%
627 and I will make a motion of ought to
 
00:38:58.990 --> 00:38:59.000 align:start position:0%
pass on House Bill 6 627 and recognize
 
00:39:01.950 --> 00:39:01.960 align:start position:0%
representative Matson I'd like to Second
 
00:39:04.630 --> 00:39:04.640 align:start position:0%
it representative Matson seconds the
 
00:39:06.589 --> 00:39:06.599 align:start position:0%
motion so it is been moved and seconded
 
00:39:11.150 --> 00:39:11.160 align:start position:0%
that we judge House Bill 627 to be uh
 
00:39:14.829 --> 00:39:14.839 align:start position:0%
worthy of the motion of ought to
 
00:39:17.990 --> 00:39:18.000 align:start position:0%
pass as I stated yesterday when I
 
00:39:20.750 --> 00:39:20.760 align:start position:0%
introduced this bill this is enabling
 
00:39:23.390 --> 00:39:23.400 align:start position:0%
legislation that allows the puc to
 
00:39:26.030 --> 00:39:26.040 align:start position:0%
designate cell phone carriers to be
 
00:39:29.030 --> 00:39:29.040 align:start position:0%
purveyors of Lifeline
 
00:39:32.550 --> 00:39:32.560 align:start position:0%
Services this bill will significantly
 
00:39:35.190 --> 00:39:35.200 align:start position:0%
assist lowincome Granite
 
00:39:38.309 --> 00:39:38.319 align:start position:0%
Staters as they try to access these
 
00:39:41.550 --> 00:39:41.560 align:start position:0%
Lifeline Services which can include tele
 
00:39:45.589 --> 00:39:45.599 align:start position:0%
medicine and easier ways to contact
 
00:39:48.870 --> 00:39:48.880 align:start position:0%
Health Pro Health Providers they can
 
00:39:51.430 --> 00:39:51.440 align:start position:0%
Prov it can provide internet service
 
00:39:53.670 --> 00:39:53.680 align:start position:0%
where people might not be able to afford
 
00:39:56.950 --> 00:39:56.960 align:start position:0%
internet service on their own so this is
 
00:39:59.470 --> 00:39:59.480 align:start position:0%
um quality legislation that's been
 
00:40:02.630 --> 00:40:02.640 align:start position:0%
adopted widely across the country and I
 
00:40:05.270 --> 00:40:05.280 align:start position:0%
think it's time for New Hampshire to
 
00:40:08.630 --> 00:40:08.640 align:start position:0%
join the rest of the states who have
 
00:40:10.990 --> 00:40:11.000 align:start position:0%
determined that this
 
00:40:16.030 --> 00:40:16.040 align:start position:0%
is valuable legislation for the
 
00:40:19.390 --> 00:40:19.400 align:start position:0%
less uh fortunate members of our
 
00:40:25.190 --> 00:40:25.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:27.990 --> 00:40:28.000 align:start position:0%
bill representative Corman
 
00:40:29.829 --> 00:40:29.839 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh I I was
 
00:40:31.870 --> 00:40:31.880 align:start position:0%
actually the only Democratic co-sponsor
 
00:40:34.950 --> 00:40:34.960 align:start position:0%
on the bill and um I I agree with with
 
00:40:36.910 --> 00:40:36.920 align:start position:0%
the intent here
 
00:40:39.430 --> 00:40:39.440 align:start position:0%
um these days a lot of people don't have
 
00:40:43.470 --> 00:40:43.480 align:start position:0%
landlines might not have access to uh to
 
00:40:45.790 --> 00:40:45.800 align:start position:0%
good internet but they might have cell
 
00:40:48.550 --> 00:40:48.560 align:start position:0%
phones with some cell phone access and I
 
00:40:50.829 --> 00:40:50.839 align:start position:0%
I think this is pretty reasonable uh I
 
00:40:52.430 --> 00:40:52.440 align:start position:0%
was a little surprised that we got very
 
00:40:55.270 --> 00:40:55.280 align:start position:0%
little public input on this uh we had no
 
00:40:57.430 --> 00:40:57.440 align:start position:0%
signups on the blue sheet either way and
 
00:40:59.390 --> 00:40:59.400 align:start position:0%
I looked online and it was one for and
 
00:41:03.589 --> 00:41:03.599 align:start position:0%
one against so not a lot of public
 
00:41:07.230 --> 00:41:07.240 align:start position:0%
input any other comments representative
 
00:41:10.710 --> 00:41:10.720 align:start position:0%
rolds uh thanks Mr chairman I less less
 
00:41:13.710 --> 00:41:13.720 align:start position:0%
a comment more than a a question um for
 
00:41:18.750 --> 00:41:18.760 align:start position:0%
you do do you think is there anything um
 
00:41:21.710 --> 00:41:21.720 align:start position:0%
that goes along with the lifeline
 
00:41:26.150 --> 00:41:26.160 align:start position:0%
designation that the Pu May confer um
 
00:41:30.589 --> 00:41:30.599 align:start position:0%
that might help in uh places
 
00:41:35.670 --> 00:41:35.680 align:start position:0%
where cell phone coverage is is spotty
 
00:41:38.950 --> 00:41:38.960 align:start position:0%
and they have trouble sighting antennas
 
00:41:41.349 --> 00:41:41.359 align:start position:0%
uh you know for example like somebody's
 
00:41:42.870 --> 00:41:42.880 align:start position:0%
going to be relying on their cell phone
 
00:41:44.870 --> 00:41:44.880 align:start position:0%
for a Lifeline but they live in an area
 
00:41:48.309 --> 00:41:48.319 align:start position:0%
where the coverage isn't very good
 
00:41:50.990 --> 00:41:51.000 align:start position:0%
that's might be a problem so you know
 
00:41:52.430 --> 00:41:52.440 align:start position:0%
like there's places on the Sea Coast
 
00:41:54.670 --> 00:41:54.680 align:start position:0%
where they they can't seem to get a
 
00:41:56.150 --> 00:41:56.160 align:start position:0%
tower in because there's local
 
00:41:59.069 --> 00:41:59.079 align:start position:0%
opposition to a tower and yet if people
 
00:42:00.589 --> 00:42:00.599 align:start position:0%
were relying on their cell phone to call
 
00:42:02.390 --> 00:42:02.400 align:start position:0%
and they have a heart attack
 
00:42:05.349 --> 00:42:05.359 align:start position:0%
they so I'm hoping you know that this
 
00:42:08.109 --> 00:42:08.119 align:start position:0%
will help sounds like a an opportunity
 
00:42:10.109 --> 00:42:10.119 align:start position:0%
for another bill maybe next
 
00:42:13.589 --> 00:42:13.599 align:start position:0%
year further comments representative
 
00:42:17.109 --> 00:42:17.119 align:start position:0%
Wendy Thomas thank you uh Mr chair um
 
00:42:21.190 --> 00:42:21.200 align:start position:0%
during testimony um I had heard someone
 
00:42:24.950 --> 00:42:24.960 align:start position:0%
and I I didn't I didn't um write down
 
00:42:27.829 --> 00:42:27.839 align:start position:0%
who said it but um if it ain't broke
 
00:42:30.390 --> 00:42:30.400 align:start position:0%
which this apparently isn't then don't
 
00:42:32.030 --> 00:42:32.040 align:start position:0%
fix it
 
00:42:35.829 --> 00:42:35.839 align:start position:0%
so I would like some clarification of of
 
00:42:39.589 --> 00:42:39.599 align:start position:0%
why this move is important if it seems
 
00:42:41.829 --> 00:42:41.839 align:start position:0%
to be working right now and I would like
 
00:42:45.109 --> 00:42:45.119 align:start position:0%
that from from you the sponsor
 
00:42:47.990 --> 00:42:48.000 align:start position:0%
please well as I said in my opening
 
00:42:51.349 --> 00:42:51.359 align:start position:0%
remarks here this is enabling
 
00:42:54.069 --> 00:42:54.079 align:start position:0%
legislation and it's very likely that
 
00:42:56.230 --> 00:42:56.240 align:start position:0%
the kind of people who could benefit
 
00:42:59.589 --> 00:42:59.599 align:start position:0%
from the life line services that the
 
00:43:01.870 --> 00:43:01.880 align:start position:0%
expansion of Lifeline service capability
 
00:43:03.870 --> 00:43:03.880 align:start position:0%
that this bill would provide don't even
 
00:43:05.790 --> 00:43:05.800 align:start position:0%
know that
 
00:43:09.870 --> 00:43:09.880 align:start position:0%
this that Lifeline Services exist but
 
00:43:12.150 --> 00:43:12.160 align:start position:0%
they may find out about it at some point
 
00:43:15.030 --> 00:43:15.040 align:start position:0%
and may be distressed to discover that
 
00:43:17.309 --> 00:43:17.319 align:start position:0%
they can't access those Services is all
 
00:43:20.190 --> 00:43:20.200 align:start position:0%
if all they have is a cell phone they
 
00:43:23.230 --> 00:43:23.240 align:start position:0%
don't own a computer or have the ability
 
00:43:25.829 --> 00:43:25.839 align:start position:0%
to connect to the Internet or have a
 
00:43:28.589 --> 00:43:28.599 align:start position:0%
landline so
 
00:43:32.109 --> 00:43:32.119 align:start position:0%
so I I would disagree with
 
00:43:35.710 --> 00:43:35.720 align:start position:0%
your characterization of this as of the
 
00:43:37.510 --> 00:43:37.520 align:start position:0%
existing system as
 
00:43:37.520 --> 00:43:39.069 align:start position:0%
existing system as
being

00:43:39.069 --> 00:43:39.079 align:start position:0%
being
 
00:43:43.430 --> 00:43:43.440 align:start position:0%
uh not broke I would say it is broke if
 
00:43:45.230 --> 00:43:45.240 align:start position:0%
some people can't take advantage of
 
00:43:45.240 --> 00:43:46.950 align:start position:0%
some people can't take advantage of
Lifeline

00:43:46.950 --> 00:43:46.960 align:start position:0%
Lifeline
 
00:43:49.950 --> 00:43:49.960 align:start position:0%
Services any further
 
00:43:52.829 --> 00:43:52.839 align:start position:0%
discussion Vice chair Thomas thank you
 
00:43:54.790 --> 00:43:54.800 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman I'll be voting in favor of
 
00:43:58.150 --> 00:43:58.160 align:start position:0%
the OTP motion I just want to add that
 
00:44:01.270 --> 00:44:01.280 align:start position:0%
it was my understanding anyway that life
 
00:44:04.750 --> 00:44:04.760 align:start position:0%
sign services Lifeline Services are not
 
00:44:08.589 --> 00:44:08.599 align:start position:0%
the same thing as 911 911 is a totally
 
00:44:10.990 --> 00:44:11.000 align:start position:0%
different program which is available all
 
00:44:13.910 --> 00:44:13.920 align:start position:0%
the time on mobile phones or landline
 
00:44:17.190 --> 00:44:17.200 align:start position:0%
phones my understanding is that LIF line
 
00:44:19.430 --> 00:44:19.440 align:start position:0%
services could incorporate things for
 
00:44:21.870 --> 00:44:21.880 align:start position:0%
even the handicap like Clos caption when
 
00:44:24.150 --> 00:44:24.160 align:start position:0%
it comes across their screen or things
 
00:44:26.589 --> 00:44:26.599 align:start position:0%
of of of that nature so this is a a
 
00:44:28.829 --> 00:44:28.839 align:start position:0%
different program and if this bill
 
00:44:31.670 --> 00:44:31.680 align:start position:0%
enhances the ability to assign a carrier
 
00:44:34.790 --> 00:44:34.800 align:start position:0%
for it then I'm I'm all for
 
00:44:37.349 --> 00:44:37.359 align:start position:0%
that additional
 
00:44:39.630 --> 00:44:39.640 align:start position:0%
comments seeing none I'll ask the clerk
 
00:44:42.270 --> 00:44:42.280 align:start position:0%
to call the role on the question of the
 
00:44:47.069 --> 00:44:47.079 align:start position:0%

it's uh 10:00 and it's time to start our

public
 
01:01:27.670 --> 01:01:27.680 align:start position:0%
hearing this morning and into the
 
01:01:31.190 --> 01:01:31.200 align:start position:0%
afternoon the uh bill on the docket
 
01:01:33.549 --> 01:01:33.559 align:start position:0%
right now is HB
 
01:01:37.630 --> 01:01:37.640 align:start position:0%
504 relative to the state energy policy
 
01:01:39.349 --> 01:01:39.359 align:start position:0%
and I would like to welcome
 
01:01:42.270 --> 01:01:42.280 align:start position:0%
representative chairman Michael Vose uh
 
01:01:46.470 --> 01:01:46.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:49.510 --> 01:01:49.520 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you Mr Vice chairman and good
 
01:01:51.549 --> 01:01:51.559 align:start position:0%
morning once again to members of the
 
01:01:53.750 --> 01:01:53.760 align:start position:0%
committee for the record representative
 
01:01:57.630 --> 01:01:57.640 align:start position:0%
Michael Vose I represent rocking ham 5
 
01:01:59.309 --> 01:01:59.319 align:start position:0%
the town of effing and I'm here to
 
01:02:05.309 --> 01:02:05.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:09.430 --> 01:02:09.440 align:start position:0%
54 this bill was the policy of the house
 
01:02:13.870 --> 01:02:13.880 align:start position:0%
last year last term it was passed by the
 
01:02:18.589 --> 01:02:18.599 align:start position:0%
house by 16 votes and when it got to the
 
01:02:22.670 --> 01:02:22.680 align:start position:0%
Senate the Senate uh rejected the first
 
01:02:26.190 --> 01:02:26.200 align:start position:0%
part of the bill and passed the second
 
01:02:29.430 --> 01:02:29.440 align:start position:0%
part of the bill which starts
 
01:02:32.789 --> 01:02:32.799 align:start position:0%
um on line 24 it says two loss of
 
01:02:37.109 --> 01:02:37.119 align:start position:0%
instate instate electrical generation
 
01:02:39.549 --> 01:02:39.559 align:start position:0%
capacity and the reason I resubmitted
 
01:02:41.069 --> 01:02:41.079 align:start position:0%
this bill is because I think it's
 
01:02:43.430 --> 01:02:43.440 align:start position:0%
important for New Hampshire energy
 
01:02:48.470 --> 01:02:48.480 align:start position:0%
policy to emphasize affordability and
 
01:02:51.630 --> 01:02:51.640 align:start position:0%
reliability and also to try to insulate
 
01:02:54.230 --> 01:02:54.240 align:start position:0%
and protect the rate
 
01:02:57.950 --> 01:02:57.960 align:start position:0%
payers and the citizens of New Hampshire
 
01:03:02.630 --> 01:03:02.640 align:start position:0%
from the intrusion of policies that we
 
01:03:05.670 --> 01:03:05.680 align:start position:0%
don't necessarily agree with from our
 
01:03:09.630 --> 01:03:09.640 align:start position:0%
neighbors to the north south east and
 
01:03:13.910 --> 01:03:13.920 align:start position:0%
west so what this bill does
 
01:03:16.309 --> 01:03:16.319 align:start position:0%
and I'm not going to go through it line
 
01:03:20.230 --> 01:03:20.240 align:start position:0%
by line because as I said we passed this
 
01:03:22.510 --> 01:03:22.520 align:start position:0%
bill last year so it's pretty well
 
01:03:24.670 --> 01:03:24.680 align:start position:0%
understood by most members of this
 
01:03:24.680 --> 01:03:27.029 align:start position:0%
understood by most members of this
committee

01:03:27.029 --> 01:03:27.039 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:03:30.069 --> 01:03:30.079 align:start position:0%
but essentially just puts into statute
 
01:03:33.630 --> 01:03:33.640 align:start position:0%
some important principles that we need
 
01:03:36.750 --> 01:03:36.760 align:start position:0%
to pay very close attent attention to it
 
01:03:39.269 --> 01:03:39.279 align:start position:0%
is our responsibility as members of the
 
01:03:41.750 --> 01:03:41.760 align:start position:0%
legislature to protect the health safety
 
01:03:43.910 --> 01:03:43.920 align:start position:0%
and Welfare of our citizens and one of
 
01:03:46.069 --> 01:03:46.079 align:start position:0%
the ways we can do that is to make sure
 
01:03:49.670 --> 01:03:49.680 align:start position:0%
that they have affordable reliable and
 
01:03:54.150 --> 01:03:54.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:56.390 --> 01:03:56.400 align:start position:0%
resources and that's what the Bill does
 
01:03:58.829 --> 01:03:58.839 align:start position:0%
it puts into statute
 
01:04:03.069 --> 01:04:03.079 align:start position:0%
the principles and ideas that will allow
 
01:04:10.829 --> 01:04:10.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:14.390 --> 01:04:14.400 align:start position:0%
out energy resources that are affordable
 
01:04:14.400 --> 01:04:17.789 align:start position:0%
out energy resources that are affordable
and

01:04:17.789 --> 01:04:17.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:21.029 --> 01:04:21.039 align:start position:0%
reliable I am open to the idea that
 
01:04:23.430 --> 01:04:23.440 align:start position:0%
maybe some of the language in this bill
 
01:04:26.510 --> 01:04:26.520 align:start position:0%
could be improved and I've already
 
01:04:28.829 --> 01:04:28.839 align:start position:0%
talked to some folks who have some
 
01:04:32.109 --> 01:04:32.119 align:start position:0%
suggested improvements to make and so
 
01:04:35.349 --> 01:04:35.359 align:start position:0%
likely when we bring this bill to
 
01:04:38.269 --> 01:04:38.279 align:start position:0%
Executive session we will offer some uh
 
01:04:40.470 --> 01:04:40.480 align:start position:0%
wording changes that will make it an
 
01:04:42.710 --> 01:04:42.720 align:start position:0%
even better Bill than it was when it
 
01:04:45.549 --> 01:04:45.559 align:start position:0%
passed the house last
 
01:04:49.430 --> 01:04:49.440 align:start position:0%
year so with that introduction uh Mr
 
01:04:51.710 --> 01:04:51.720 align:start position:0%
Vice chair I'd be happy to take
 
01:04:53.549 --> 01:04:53.559 align:start position:0%
questions from the
 
01:04:57.109 --> 01:04:57.119 align:start position:0%
committee questions
 
01:05:00.510 --> 01:05:00.520 align:start position:0%
representative Coleman
 
01:05:02.750 --> 01:05:02.760 align:start position:0%
kman I keep getting you mixed up with
 
01:05:03.789 --> 01:05:03.799 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Vice chair I'm gonna have
 
01:05:05.309 --> 01:05:05.319 align:start position:0%
to work with you on how to pronounce my
 
01:05:07.510 --> 01:05:07.520 align:start position:0%
name I keep getting mixed up with the
 
01:05:10.390 --> 01:05:10.400 align:start position:0%
Coleman Gast over think of Harvey Corman
 
01:05:12.349 --> 01:05:12.359 align:start position:0%
from the Carol Bernett show spelled
 
01:05:15.109 --> 01:05:15.119 align:start position:0%
differently but pronounced the same or
 
01:05:19.309 --> 01:05:19.319 align:start position:0%
or Roger Corman the the movie director
 
01:05:23.269 --> 01:05:23.279 align:start position:0%
anyway thank you Mr Vice chair thank you
 
01:05:26.349 --> 01:05:26.359 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman for taking my question
 
01:05:28.390 --> 01:05:28.400 align:start position:0%
uh when I look at the bill uh I'm
 
01:05:31.269 --> 01:05:31.279 align:start position:0%
looking at page one line 7 which talks
 
01:05:32.950 --> 01:05:32.960 align:start position:0%
about without preference toward
 
01:05:35.990 --> 01:05:36.000 align:start position:0%
technology type and then line 13
 
01:05:39.630 --> 01:05:39.640 align:start position:0%
allowing Market forces and line 16 and
 
01:05:42.630 --> 01:05:42.640 align:start position:0%
17 uh according to Market
 
01:05:46.309 --> 01:05:46.319 align:start position:0%
principles and I think about um how our
 
01:05:48.269 --> 01:05:48.279 align:start position:0%
governor talked about having an all of
 
01:05:50.430 --> 01:05:50.440 align:start position:0%
the above energy
 
01:05:53.950 --> 01:05:53.960 align:start position:0%
strategy and um it seems like all all of
 
01:05:55.309 --> 01:05:55.319 align:start position:0%
this is consistent with what our
 
01:05:57.589 --> 01:05:57.599 align:start position:0%
governor govern has said on the other
 
01:06:00.230 --> 01:06:00.240 align:start position:0%
hand our governor has said and we
 
01:06:03.349 --> 01:06:03.359 align:start position:0%
actually have a pending uh house
 
01:06:06.069 --> 01:06:06.079 align:start position:0%
concurrent resolution prohibiting
 
01:06:06.079 --> 01:06:07.710 align:start position:0%
concurrent resolution prohibiting
offshore

01:06:07.710 --> 01:06:07.720 align:start position:0%
offshore
 
01:06:11.750 --> 01:06:11.760 align:start position:0%
wind so these that seems to be at odds
 
01:06:14.390 --> 01:06:14.400 align:start position:0%
with saying that there's uh without
 
01:06:16.589 --> 01:06:16.599 align:start position:0%
preference toward technology type and
 
01:06:19.710 --> 01:06:19.720 align:start position:0%
and relying solely on Market forces and
 
01:06:21.990 --> 01:06:22.000 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering uh is there a way to
 
01:06:25.829 --> 01:06:25.839 align:start position:0%
reconcile these two Notions
 
01:06:28.230 --> 01:06:28.240 align:start position:0%
yes I believe there is because the major
 
01:06:30.069 --> 01:06:30.079 align:start position:0%
emphasis of this
 
01:06:32.309 --> 01:06:32.319 align:start position:0%
legislation is affordability and
 
01:06:36.109 --> 01:06:36.119 align:start position:0%
reliability and offshore wind cannot
 
01:06:39.309 --> 01:06:39.319 align:start position:0%
provide energy that's affordable or
 
01:06:41.510 --> 01:06:41.520 align:start position:0%
energy that's
 
01:06:45.109 --> 01:06:45.119 align:start position:0%
reliable now offshore wind might be part
 
01:06:48.589 --> 01:06:48.599 align:start position:0%
of the energy mix if it can be shown to
 
01:06:50.750 --> 01:06:50.760 align:start position:0%
be affordable and reliable if it ever
 
01:06:54.269 --> 01:06:54.279 align:start position:0%
gets to that point currently it it's far
 
01:06:56.549 --> 01:06:56.559 align:start position:0%
from that point but if it ever gets to
 
01:06:59.109 --> 01:06:59.119 align:start position:0%
that point then certainly it could be
 
01:07:00.109 --> 01:07:00.119 align:start position:0%
part of the
 
01:07:02.630 --> 01:07:02.640 align:start position:0%
mix and there will probably be
 
01:07:05.470 --> 01:07:05.480 align:start position:0%
additional language added to this uh
 
01:07:10.190 --> 01:07:10.200 align:start position:0%
bill at Amendment time to emphasize that
 
01:07:12.829 --> 01:07:12.839 align:start position:0%
fuel diversity is a value that we that
 
01:07:15.710 --> 01:07:15.720 align:start position:0%
we hold that energy policy should
 
01:07:15.720 --> 01:07:17.109 align:start position:0%
we hold that energy policy should
seriously

01:07:17.109 --> 01:07:17.119 align:start position:0%
seriously
 
01:07:20.990 --> 01:07:21.000 align:start position:0%
consider so I think the affordability
 
01:07:24.950 --> 01:07:24.960 align:start position:0%
reliability question reconciles with the
 
01:07:28.589 --> 01:07:28.599 align:start position:0%
technology neutral aspect of energy
 
01:07:31.789 --> 01:07:31.799 align:start position:0%
policy in that yeah we don't care what
 
01:07:34.789 --> 01:07:34.799 align:start position:0%
it is as long as it's in affordable and
 
01:07:38.549 --> 01:07:38.559 align:start position:0%
reliable follow up follow up thank
 
01:07:43.309 --> 01:07:43.319 align:start position:0%
you so I can't disagree that uh wind
 
01:07:45.829 --> 01:07:45.839 align:start position:0%
currently is is not very favored in the
 
01:07:48.150 --> 01:07:48.160 align:start position:0%
market and and you know it's the wind
 
01:07:50.390 --> 01:07:50.400 align:start position:0%
does not always blow uh that's certainly
 
01:07:52.750 --> 01:07:52.760 align:start position:0%
true on the other hand
 
01:07:57.150 --> 01:07:57.160 align:start position:0%
um given that there is a possibility of
 
01:08:01.069 --> 01:08:01.079 align:start position:0%
an HCR about prohibiting offshore wind
 
01:08:04.069 --> 01:08:04.079 align:start position:0%
uh I am concerned about that conflicting
 
01:08:06.309 --> 01:08:06.319 align:start position:0%
with this statement about without
 
01:08:08.150 --> 01:08:08.160 align:start position:0%
preference toward technology type we
 
01:08:10.670 --> 01:08:10.680 align:start position:0%
would have an HCR that conflicts with
 
01:08:13.430 --> 01:08:13.440 align:start position:0%
something that could be in statute and
 
01:08:15.789 --> 01:08:15.799 align:start position:0%
um I'm I'm just
 
01:08:18.269 --> 01:08:18.279 align:start position:0%
wondering how to reconcile those two
 
01:08:20.870 --> 01:08:20.880 align:start position:0%
things when you say that is your a
 
01:08:22.390 --> 01:08:22.400 align:start position:0%
question coming up here well yeah just
 
01:08:23.789 --> 01:08:23.799 align:start position:0%
wondering how to reconcile that when
 
01:08:26.110 --> 01:08:26.120 align:start position:0%
when we say that we can't have offshore
 
01:08:27.910 --> 01:08:27.920 align:start position:0%
win but then we say without preference
 
01:08:29.189 --> 01:08:29.199 align:start position:0%
it seems like those two things are at
 
01:08:32.309 --> 01:08:32.319 align:start position:0%
odds and I I just I'm just wondering can
 
01:08:35.550 --> 01:08:35.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:37.990 --> 01:08:38.000 align:start position:0%
language well the answer to that
 
01:08:41.709 --> 01:08:41.719 align:start position:0%
question would be maybe we haven't heard
 
01:08:44.789 --> 01:08:44.799 align:start position:0%
HCR two or four I forget what the number
 
01:08:47.749 --> 01:08:47.759 align:start position:0%
of the resolution is we haven't heard
 
01:08:50.189 --> 01:08:50.199 align:start position:0%
that uh we haven't decided whether that
 
01:08:54.430 --> 01:08:54.440 align:start position:0%
will even pass so uh I don't see that
 
01:08:56.829 --> 01:08:56.839 align:start position:0%
it's necessary for us to reconcile that
 
01:09:00.590 --> 01:09:00.600 align:start position:0%
at this point in time but even if the
 
01:09:03.149 --> 01:09:03.159 align:start position:0%
resolution were to pass it's non-binding
 
01:09:05.030 --> 01:09:05.040 align:start position:0%
it's a
 
01:09:08.910 --> 01:09:08.920 align:start position:0%
resolution uh representative
 
01:09:11.510 --> 01:09:11.520 align:start position:0%
Bernardi just to add a little uh
 
01:09:13.870 --> 01:09:13.880 align:start position:0%
frosting to that cake
 
01:09:17.590 --> 01:09:17.600 align:start position:0%
um the this bill talks about all
 
01:09:20.269 --> 01:09:20.279 align:start position:0%
Technologies being considered and so
 
01:09:24.269 --> 01:09:24.279 align:start position:0%
windmills per se are not uh disfavored
 
01:09:27.709 --> 01:09:27.719 align:start position:0%
the location of windmills is the issue
 
01:09:32.030 --> 01:09:32.040 align:start position:0%
at hand and uh because the offshore
 
01:09:36.669 --> 01:09:36.679 align:start position:0%
nature of them creates uh far more uh of
 
01:09:39.550 --> 01:09:39.560 align:start position:0%
a greater reliability and cost uh
 
01:09:43.590 --> 01:09:43.600 align:start position:0%
concern than potentially landbase
 
01:09:46.550 --> 01:09:46.560 align:start position:0%
windmills was that a question no it's a
 
01:09:46.560 --> 01:09:51.030 align:start position:0%
windmills was that a question no it's a
comment

01:09:51.030 --> 01:09:51.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:53.310 --> 01:09:53.320 align:start position:0%
too representative
 
01:09:56.270 --> 01:09:56.280 align:start position:0%
McGee thank you Mr Vice chair and thank
 
01:10:00.630 --> 01:10:00.640 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman um I I was here for um
 
01:10:02.470 --> 01:10:02.480 align:start position:0%
the the version of this that we had in
 
01:10:06.229 --> 01:10:06.239 align:start position:0%
the last uh bium and I was also on the
 
01:10:08.990 --> 01:10:09.000 align:start position:0%
subcommittee where we agreed that we
 
01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:09.910 align:start position:0%
subcommittee where we agreed that we
would

01:10:09.910 --> 01:10:09.920 align:start position:0%
would
 
01:10:14.310 --> 01:10:14.320 align:start position:0%
maintain 3 7837 which this bill repeals
 
01:10:14.320 --> 01:10:15.070 align:start position:0%
maintain 3 7837 which this bill repeals
and

01:10:15.070 --> 01:10:15.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:10:18.910 --> 01:10:18.920 align:start position:0%
replaces and I I wanted to offer to my
 
01:10:22.310 --> 01:10:22.320 align:start position:0%
colleagues who are not familiar with the
 
01:10:24.750 --> 01:10:24.760 align:start position:0%
um basically the definition of New
 
01:10:26.110 --> 01:10:26.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's energ energy policy that
 
01:10:28.390 --> 01:10:28.400 align:start position:0%
exists it's quite brief but it's also
 
01:10:30.350 --> 01:10:30.360 align:start position:0%
comprehensive and that it it lists all
 
01:10:31.709 --> 01:10:31.719 align:start position:0%
the things we're talking about but it
 
01:10:34.070 --> 01:10:34.080 align:start position:0%
does it in a more elegant way it says
 
01:10:36.709 --> 01:10:36.719 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire energy policy the general
 
01:10:38.310 --> 01:10:38.320 align:start position:0%
court declares that it shall be the
 
01:10:40.830 --> 01:10:40.840 align:start position:0%
energy policy of the state to meet the
 
01:10:42.350 --> 01:10:42.360 align:start position:0%
energy needs of the citizens and
 
01:10:44.310 --> 01:10:44.320 align:start position:0%
businesses of the state at the lowest
 
01:10:47.149 --> 01:10:47.159 align:start position:0%
reasonable cost while providing for
 
01:10:49.310 --> 01:10:49.320 align:start position:0%
reliability and diversity of energy
 
01:10:51.870 --> 01:10:51.880 align:start position:0%
sources to maximize the use of
 
01:10:53.630 --> 01:10:53.640 align:start position:0%
cost-effective Energy Efficiency and
 
01:10:55.750 --> 01:10:55.760 align:start position:0%
other demand side resources
 
01:10:57.550 --> 01:10:57.560 align:start position:0%
and to protect the safety and health of
 
01:10:59.750 --> 01:10:59.760 align:start position:0%
the citizens the physical environment of
 
01:11:02.830 --> 01:11:02.840 align:start position:0%
the state and the future supplies of
 
01:11:05.430 --> 01:11:05.440 align:start position:0%
resources with consideration of the
 
01:11:06.950 --> 01:11:06.960 align:start position:0%
financial stability of the state's
 
01:11:08.990 --> 01:11:09.000 align:start position:0%
utilities so it really is an
 
01:11:11.870 --> 01:11:11.880 align:start position:0%
all-encompassing very simple single
 
01:11:15.830 --> 01:11:15.840 align:start position:0%
paragraph and all of these sections
 
01:11:18.270 --> 01:11:18.280 align:start position:0%
would overwrite this paragraph so that
 
01:11:20.709 --> 01:11:20.719 align:start position:0%
the effort that was made to keep it
 
01:11:23.189 --> 01:11:23.199 align:start position:0%
comprehensive but very simple so that
 
01:11:24.790 --> 01:11:24.800 align:start position:0%
anyone could just read the state's
 
01:11:26.350 --> 01:11:26.360 align:start position:0%
energy policy and understand that it
 
01:11:28.390 --> 01:11:28.400 align:start position:0%
included all those
 
01:11:30.990 --> 01:11:31.000 align:start position:0%
things coming there well I'm trying to
 
01:11:33.070 --> 01:11:33.080 align:start position:0%
provide context that other members don't
 
01:11:35.149 --> 01:11:35.159 align:start position:0%
have for the many many many many
 
01:11:36.910 --> 01:11:36.920 align:start position:0%
conversations that led to this bill
 
01:11:40.790 --> 01:11:40.800 align:start position:0%
being defeated last time so um what I'm
 
01:11:43.590 --> 01:11:43.600 align:start position:0%
trying to say is we should think about
 
01:11:47.629 --> 01:11:47.639 align:start position:0%
whether we want to be repealing and I
 
01:11:49.390 --> 01:11:49.400 align:start position:0%
think it was rejected by the Senate last
 
01:11:53.550 --> 01:11:53.560 align:start position:0%
time so I will ask um the Pres the the
 
01:11:55.830 --> 01:11:55.840 align:start position:0%
chair um
 
01:11:57.550 --> 01:11:57.560 align:start position:0%
what is it that you think
 
01:12:00.910 --> 01:12:00.920 align:start position:0%
is uh an improvement in the language
 
01:12:02.910 --> 01:12:02.920 align:start position:0%
that you're providing in section in
 
01:12:06.550 --> 01:12:06.560 align:start position:0%
section one uh a through F that is an
 
01:12:08.709 --> 01:12:08.719 align:start position:0%
improvement over that very simple
 
01:12:10.310 --> 01:12:10.320 align:start position:0%
paragraph which covers all of the things
 
01:12:13.030 --> 01:12:13.040 align:start position:0%
that you're stating about reliability
 
01:12:15.189 --> 01:12:15.199 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
01:12:16.990 --> 01:12:17.000 align:start position:0%
affordability well I think the
 
01:12:20.310 --> 01:12:20.320 align:start position:0%
difference is that this version of a
 
01:12:22.510 --> 01:12:22.520 align:start position:0%
state energy policy would place the
 
01:12:24.310 --> 01:12:24.320 align:start position:0%
emphasis on affordability and
 
01:12:26.350 --> 01:12:26.360 align:start position:0%
reliability which is where it needs to
 
01:12:30.669 --> 01:12:30.679 align:start position:0%
be not just mention it in passing as the
 
01:12:32.910 --> 01:12:32.920 align:start position:0%
existing language does I think it's
 
01:12:35.189 --> 01:12:35.199 align:start position:0%
important for us
 
01:12:35.199 --> 01:12:36.830 align:start position:0%
important for us
to

01:12:36.830 --> 01:12:36.840 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:12:36.840 --> 01:12:39.629 align:start position:0%
to
recognize

01:12:39.629 --> 01:12:39.639 align:start position:0%
recognize
 
01:12:43.310 --> 01:12:43.320 align:start position:0%
that when I go out and and talk to
 
01:12:46.430 --> 01:12:46.440 align:start position:0%
constituents about electricity
 
01:12:48.990 --> 01:12:49.000 align:start position:0%
service they do complain to some degree
 
01:12:50.590 --> 01:12:50.600 align:start position:0%
about the price and the cost of
 
01:12:52.430 --> 01:12:52.440 align:start position:0%
electricity but mostly what they
 
01:12:56.110 --> 01:12:56.120 align:start position:0%
complain about is power outages loss of
 
01:12:58.709 --> 01:12:58.719 align:start position:0%
electricity electrical power that's a
 
01:13:02.310 --> 01:13:02.320 align:start position:0%
reliability issue and so we have to
 
01:13:02.320 --> 01:13:04.189 align:start position:0%
reliability issue and so we have to
design

01:13:04.189 --> 01:13:04.199 align:start position:0%
design
 
01:13:08.430 --> 01:13:08.440 align:start position:0%
and policy to protect the reliability of
 
01:13:11.590 --> 01:13:11.600 align:start position:0%
the supply of electricity and there are
 
01:13:13.510 --> 01:13:13.520 align:start position:0%
other things that we'd like to do over
 
01:13:17.910 --> 01:13:17.920 align:start position:0%
and above that but the bottom line is
 
01:13:20.070 --> 01:13:20.080 align:start position:0%
we've got to make it
 
01:13:24.390 --> 01:13:24.400 align:start position:0%
reliable and affordable too but uh we
 
01:13:26.830 --> 01:13:26.840 align:start position:0%
need to emphas EMP iiz that in our state
 
01:13:30.149 --> 01:13:30.159 align:start position:0%
energy policy can I follow up before I
 
01:13:31.750 --> 01:13:31.760 align:start position:0%
allow followup I'd like to make a
 
01:13:34.149 --> 01:13:34.159 align:start position:0%
comment that I've allowed some latitude
 
01:13:36.350 --> 01:13:36.360 align:start position:0%
but we do need when we question the
 
01:13:38.910 --> 01:13:38.920 align:start position:0%
testifier we do need to be direct and
 
01:13:42.070 --> 01:13:42.080 align:start position:0%
answer the question and not a dis ration
 
01:13:45.830 --> 01:13:45.840 align:start position:0%
leading to a potential question um so
 
01:13:47.709 --> 01:13:47.719 align:start position:0%
please be brief with your question so he
 
01:13:50.310 --> 01:13:50.320 align:start position:0%
can ask a question and in the terms of
 
01:13:52.550 --> 01:13:52.560 align:start position:0%
he may want he may have to answer to
 
01:13:54.149 --> 01:13:54.159 align:start position:0%
give the information you're that you're
 
01:13:56.070 --> 01:13:56.080 align:start position:0%
looking for go ahead with the follow
 
01:13:57.950 --> 01:13:57.960 align:start position:0%
thank you yes I just had a simple
 
01:14:02.310 --> 01:14:02.320 align:start position:0%
question so how does the bill emphasize
 
01:14:02.320 --> 01:14:04.149 align:start position:0%
question so how does the bill emphasize
or

01:14:04.149 --> 01:14:04.159 align:start position:0%
or
 
01:14:07.669 --> 01:14:07.679 align:start position:0%
improve uh the reliability of energy for
 
01:14:11.189 --> 01:14:11.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:13.870 --> 01:14:13.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire what we have well the language
 
01:14:17.590 --> 01:14:17.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:21.790 --> 01:14:21.800 align:start position:0%
seven that well Lin 6 seven and 8 that
 
01:14:23.149 --> 01:14:23.159 align:start position:0%
the state will promote the development
 
01:14:25.310 --> 01:14:25.320 align:start position:0%
of resources to achieve the purpose of
 
01:14:27.510 --> 01:14:27.520 align:start position:0%
this chapter without preference to our
 
01:14:30.430 --> 01:14:30.440 align:start position:0%
technology type with an emphasis on
 
01:14:33.310 --> 01:14:33.320 align:start position:0%
reliable on demand and firm resources
 
01:14:34.830 --> 01:14:34.840 align:start position:0%
that is the
 
01:14:38.110 --> 01:14:38.120 align:start position:0%
definition of electricity that's always
 
01:14:40.070 --> 01:14:40.080 align:start position:0%
there and that's the definition of
 
01:14:44.110 --> 01:14:44.120 align:start position:0%
reliable and that's a key component that
 
01:14:47.830 --> 01:14:47.840 align:start position:0%
we continually seem to lose sight of
 
01:14:50.629 --> 01:14:50.639 align:start position:0%
when we try to
 
01:14:55.990 --> 01:14:56.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:58.830 --> 01:14:58.840 align:start position:0%
add to our existing
 
01:14:58.840 --> 01:15:01.470 align:start position:0%
add to our existing
Energy

01:15:01.470 --> 01:15:01.480 align:start position:0%
Energy
 
01:15:04.669 --> 01:15:04.679 align:start position:0%
System ways to create energy that are
 
01:15:09.790 --> 01:15:09.800 align:start position:0%
not reliable and that uh degrade the
 
01:15:13.870 --> 01:15:13.880 align:start position:0%
entire systems reliability so we need to
 
01:15:15.870 --> 01:15:15.880 align:start position:0%
make sure we don't do that because
 
01:15:17.510 --> 01:15:17.520 align:start position:0%
that's not what people
 
01:15:20.390 --> 01:15:20.400 align:start position:0%
want repr
 
01:15:23.149 --> 01:15:23.159 align:start position:0%
Kaplan thank you Mr Vice chair and thank
 
01:15:25.790 --> 01:15:25.800 align:start position:0%
you uh representative o Mr chair for
 
01:15:28.990 --> 01:15:29.000 align:start position:0%
coming in and representing your bill um
 
01:15:30.430 --> 01:15:30.440 align:start position:0%
the the statute that you're seeking to
 
01:15:32.950 --> 01:15:32.960 align:start position:0%
replace on energy policy includes the
 
01:15:36.149 --> 01:15:36.159 align:start position:0%
affordability and reliability and um but
 
01:15:38.229 --> 01:15:38.239 align:start position:0%
it also includes other other factors
 
01:15:40.390 --> 01:15:40.400 align:start position:0%
that this uh this bill would would
 
01:15:42.910 --> 01:15:42.920 align:start position:0%
sacrifice would would just drop
 
01:15:44.470 --> 01:15:44.480 align:start position:0%
including you know human health
 
01:15:49.470 --> 01:15:49.480 align:start position:0%
including the environment uh and so uh
 
01:15:52.430 --> 01:15:52.440 align:start position:0%
my question is why why do you need to
 
01:15:54.350 --> 01:15:54.360 align:start position:0%
sacrifice those elements in order to
 
01:15:56.510 --> 01:15:56.520 align:start position:0%
emphasize affordability and reliability
 
01:15:58.470 --> 01:15:58.480 align:start position:0%
why why can't we have a balanced
 
01:16:01.070 --> 01:16:01.080 align:start position:0%
approach which is what I think the state
 
01:16:03.470 --> 01:16:03.480 align:start position:0%
ought to be pursuing that's just my two
 
01:16:05.510 --> 01:16:05.520 align:start position:0%
sense well I don't think it does
 
01:16:08.790 --> 01:16:08.800 align:start position:0%
sacrifice those elements it just places
 
01:16:11.629 --> 01:16:11.639 align:start position:0%
the emphasis where I feel that it needs
 
01:16:18.830 --> 01:16:18.840 align:start position:0%
to be and this language um was vetted by
 
01:16:21.030 --> 01:16:21.040 align:start position:0%
this committee and the house last year
 
01:16:24.550 --> 01:16:24.560 align:start position:0%
and judged to be worthy of Passage and
 
01:16:24.560 --> 01:16:26.110 align:start position:0%
and judged to be worthy of Passage and
so

01:16:26.110 --> 01:16:26.120 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:16:28.830 --> 01:16:28.840 align:start position:0%
while I don't think that this language
 
01:16:31.510 --> 01:16:31.520 align:start position:0%
couldn't be even better and there there
 
01:16:34.470 --> 01:16:34.480 align:start position:0%
may be some opportunities to make it
 
01:16:36.990 --> 01:16:37.000 align:start position:0%
better I think this language does what
 
01:16:39.830 --> 01:16:39.840 align:start position:0%
we need to do to indicate in state
 
01:16:42.950 --> 01:16:42.960 align:start position:0%
energy policy what really is the Crux of
 
01:16:42.960 --> 01:16:45.550 align:start position:0%
energy policy what really is the Crux of
the

01:16:45.550 --> 01:16:45.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:45.560 --> 01:16:48.110 align:start position:0%
 
issue

01:16:48.110 --> 01:16:48.120 align:start position:0%
issue
 
01:16:48.120 --> 01:16:51.550 align:start position:0%
issue
representative

01:16:51.550 --> 01:16:51.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:55.470 --> 01:16:55.480 align:start position:0%
Swanson would you say that uh and I've
 
01:16:58.310 --> 01:16:58.320 align:start position:0%
given the example before at my home
 
01:16:59.830 --> 01:16:59.840 align:start position:0%
frequent power
 
01:17:02.870 --> 01:17:02.880 align:start position:0%
outages and as far as reliability goes
 
01:17:06.229 --> 01:17:06.239 align:start position:0%
they had nothing to do with the source
 
01:17:09.870 --> 01:17:09.880 align:start position:0%
of energy and if you have the proper mix
 
01:17:12.510 --> 01:17:12.520 align:start position:0%
of sources of energy and a well-managed
 
01:17:15.430 --> 01:17:15.440 align:start position:0%
system you should be able to get
 
01:17:17.430 --> 01:17:17.440 align:start position:0%
reliability but we didn't have
 
01:17:19.390 --> 01:17:19.400 align:start position:0%
reliability the problem with reliability
 
01:17:19.400 --> 01:17:20.149 align:start position:0%
reliability the problem with reliability
is

01:17:20.149 --> 01:17:20.159 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:17:22.470 --> 01:17:22.480 align:start position:0%
infrastructure and that's where the
 
01:17:26.750 --> 01:17:26.760 align:start position:0%
focus needs to be at are you are you
 
01:17:30.110 --> 01:17:30.120 align:start position:0%
interpreting reliability to be that the
 
01:17:35.189 --> 01:17:35.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:39.709 --> 01:17:39.719 align:start position:0%
on yes that is the Crux of the issue the
 
01:17:42.510 --> 01:17:42.520 align:start position:0%
North American reliability Corporation
 
01:17:47.910 --> 01:17:47.920 align:start position:0%
in its last three yearly assessments of
 
01:17:51.270 --> 01:17:51.280 align:start position:0%
the reliability of Our National
 
01:17:53.990 --> 01:17:54.000 align:start position:0%
Grid they have said that the
 
01:17:56.669 --> 01:17:56.679 align:start position:0%
encroachment of intermittent renewable
 
01:17:59.510 --> 01:17:59.520 align:start position:0%
energy sources onto the grid and the
 
01:18:02.270 --> 01:18:02.280 align:start position:0%
retirement premature retirement
 
01:18:05.510 --> 01:18:05.520 align:start position:0%
of non-intermittent sources is
 
01:18:08.390 --> 01:18:08.400 align:start position:0%
jeopardizing the reliability of the grid
 
01:18:11.790 --> 01:18:11.800 align:start position:0%
and it calls out in its report specc
 
01:18:13.709 --> 01:18:13.719 align:start position:0%
specific sections of the country that
 
01:18:16.470 --> 01:18:16.480 align:start position:0%
are particularly vulnerable and the
 
01:18:20.070 --> 01:18:20.080 align:start position:0%
Northeast is always at the top of their
 
01:18:24.110 --> 01:18:24.120 align:start position:0%
list so yes the the problem with
 
01:18:26.709 --> 01:18:26.719 align:start position:0%
renewable energy is that its
 
01:18:31.669 --> 01:18:31.679 align:start position:0%
intermittency and its lack of backup
 
01:18:34.590 --> 01:18:34.600 align:start position:0%
resources requires that it be overbuilt
 
01:18:36.310 --> 01:18:36.320 align:start position:0%
which makes it
 
01:18:38.310 --> 01:18:38.320 align:start position:0%
expensive but doesn't solve the
 
01:18:41.750 --> 01:18:41.760 align:start position:0%
reliability issue so if we prefer
 
01:18:44.990 --> 01:18:45.000 align:start position:0%
renewable resources over non-renewable
 
01:18:47.470 --> 01:18:47.480 align:start position:0%
resources we get ourselves into a
 
01:18:51.229 --> 01:18:51.239 align:start position:0%
reliability Crunch and that is slowly
 
01:18:54.430 --> 01:18:54.440 align:start position:0%
happening and we need to take steps to
 
01:18:55.990 --> 01:18:56.000 align:start position:0%
make sure that we
 
01:18:58.709 --> 01:18:58.719 align:start position:0%
arrest that
 
01:19:01.590 --> 01:19:01.600 align:start position:0%
development representative
 
01:19:07.270 --> 01:19:07.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:10.270 --> 01:19:10.280 align:start position:0%
um given given
 
01:19:10.280 --> 01:19:11.950 align:start position:0%
um given given
the

01:19:11.950 --> 01:19:11.960 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:19:14.310 --> 01:19:14.320 align:start position:0%
presentations that we had over the last
 
01:19:18.110 --> 01:19:18.120 align:start position:0%
couple of weeks just really trly were
 
01:19:18.120 --> 01:19:19.990 align:start position:0%
couple of weeks just really trly were
illustrating

01:19:19.990 --> 01:19:20.000 align:start position:0%
illustrating
 
01:19:26.910 --> 01:19:26.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:30.229 --> 01:19:30.239 align:start position:0%
Regional Grid in which you know of which
 
01:19:32.709 --> 01:19:32.719 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is a small
 
01:19:39.189 --> 01:19:39.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:43.870 --> 01:19:43.880 align:start position:0%
the generation Assets in the that that
 
01:19:46.270 --> 01:19:46.280 align:start position:0%
that lie within the state of New
 
01:19:48.910 --> 01:19:48.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire the geographic boundaries of
 
01:19:52.270 --> 01:19:52.280 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire are part of that grid and
 
01:19:55.110 --> 01:19:55.120 align:start position:0%
yet they don't
 
01:19:56.870 --> 01:19:56.880 align:start position:0%
you know there's no
 
01:20:02.669 --> 01:20:02.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:05.229 --> 01:20:05.239 align:start position:0%
physical you know relationship
 
01:20:06.510 --> 01:20:06.520 align:start position:0%
representative are you thinking of a
 
01:20:08.430 --> 01:20:08.440 align:start position:0%
question yeah I am I have one there
 
01:20:11.070 --> 01:20:11.080 align:start position:0%
thanks I said given this and given that
 
01:20:14.310 --> 01:20:14.320 align:start position:0%
I want to know what you mean by what
 
01:20:16.270 --> 01:20:16.280 align:start position:0%
you're contemplating by the state's
 
01:20:16.280 --> 01:20:18.070 align:start position:0%
you're contemplating by the state's
energy

01:20:18.070 --> 01:20:18.080 align:start position:0%
energy
 
01:20:20.950 --> 01:20:20.960 align:start position:0%
Independence I mean we're we're
 
01:20:24.709 --> 01:20:24.719 align:start position:0%
interdependent in a grid and in fact
 
01:20:26.990 --> 01:20:27.000 align:start position:0%
with six other states because of
 
01:20:29.669 --> 01:20:29.679 align:start position:0%
interconnection to New York to Quebec
 
01:20:31.709 --> 01:20:31.719 align:start position:0%
you know the the notion of New
 
01:20:33.950 --> 01:20:33.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's energy Independence I want
 
01:20:36.709 --> 01:20:36.719 align:start position:0%
to I'm asking what you mean by
 
01:20:39.990 --> 01:20:40.000 align:start position:0%
that it's a good question and an
 
01:20:42.149 --> 01:20:42.159 align:start position:0%
important question because as I
 
01:20:46.270 --> 01:20:46.280 align:start position:0%
indicated in my in the answer to my last
 
01:20:49.669 --> 01:20:49.679 align:start position:0%
question we are subject here in New
 
01:20:49.679 --> 01:20:50.709 align:start position:0%
question we are subject here in New
Hampshire

01:20:50.709 --> 01:20:50.719 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
01:20:54.629 --> 01:20:54.639 align:start position:0%
to the activities of our neighbors
 
01:20:57.790 --> 01:20:57.800 align:start position:0%
surrounding states surrounding regions
 
01:21:01.629 --> 01:21:01.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:05.990 --> 01:21:06.000 align:start position:0%
degree and we need to put in place
 
01:21:09.590 --> 01:21:09.600 align:start position:0%
whenever possible tools
 
01:21:12.430 --> 01:21:12.440 align:start position:0%
resources that enable us
 
01:21:16.189 --> 01:21:16.199 align:start position:0%
to do what we can to protect our the
 
01:21:19.189 --> 01:21:19.199 align:start position:0%
reliability of our own
 
01:21:23.189 --> 01:21:23.199 align:start position:0%
resources when they are threatened by
 
01:21:26.110 --> 01:21:26.120 align:start position:0%
the lack of reliability of resources
 
01:21:29.030 --> 01:21:29.040 align:start position:0%
around us so by energy Independence I'm
 
01:21:31.950 --> 01:21:31.960 align:start position:0%
talking about giving our state
 
01:21:35.629 --> 01:21:35.639 align:start position:0%
government tools to resist whenever it
 
01:21:40.310 --> 01:21:40.320 align:start position:0%
can the encroachment of policies from
 
01:21:43.550 --> 01:21:43.560 align:start position:0%
surrounding states or other parts of the
 
01:21:47.149 --> 01:21:47.159 align:start position:0%
country that may negatively impact the
 
01:21:50.270 --> 01:21:50.280 align:start position:0%
reliability of our grid of of the
 
01:21:53.510 --> 01:21:53.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:56.590 --> 01:21:56.600 align:start position:0%
resources followup thank you Mr Vice
 
01:21:59.790 --> 01:21:59.800 align:start position:0%
chair um thank you chairman Vose for
 
01:21:59.800 --> 01:22:00.990 align:start position:0%
chair um thank you chairman Vose for
that

01:22:00.990 --> 01:22:01.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:22:05.430 --> 01:22:05.440 align:start position:0%
um my followup is though would would
 
01:22:07.750 --> 01:22:07.760 align:start position:0%
refer to the entire you know Roman
 
01:22:12.950 --> 01:22:12.960 align:start position:0%
numeral part two of of the
 
01:22:12.960 --> 01:22:15.110 align:start position:0%
numeral part two of of the
bill

01:22:15.110 --> 01:22:15.120 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:22:17.790 --> 01:22:17.800 align:start position:0%
um again that
 
01:22:20.950 --> 01:22:20.960 align:start position:0%
these generation assets while they may
 
01:22:24.590 --> 01:22:24.600 align:start position:0%
reside within the state of New Hampshire
 
01:22:28.669 --> 01:22:28.679 align:start position:0%
they are private assets and they
 
01:22:32.709 --> 01:22:32.719 align:start position:0%
operate in the regional market and
 
01:22:35.229 --> 01:22:35.239 align:start position:0%
there's always a lot of talk here
 
01:22:40.750 --> 01:22:40.760 align:start position:0%
about wanting the market to guide you
 
01:22:43.830 --> 01:22:43.840 align:start position:0%
know the mix of resources and prices and
 
01:22:47.750 --> 01:22:47.760 align:start position:0%
all of it and yet you seem to
 
01:22:47.760 --> 01:22:49.830 align:start position:0%
all of it and yet you seem to
contemplate

01:22:49.830 --> 01:22:49.840 align:start position:0%
contemplate
 
01:22:53.229 --> 01:22:53.239 align:start position:0%
uh you know the state taking action and
 
01:22:58.149 --> 01:22:58.159 align:start position:0%
you know the word def end a private
 
01:23:01.709 --> 01:23:01.719 align:start position:0%
entity it just seems a lot uh I guess
 
01:23:04.669 --> 01:23:04.679 align:start position:0%
I'm asking what what are you trying to
 
01:23:06.229 --> 01:23:06.239 align:start position:0%
get at here you're going to see the
 
01:23:11.030 --> 01:23:11.040 align:start position:0%
state swinging into action to sue the
 
01:23:14.310 --> 01:23:14.320 align:start position:0%
federal government over should a
 
01:23:16.430 --> 01:23:16.440 align:start position:0%
generation asset within the state of New
 
01:23:18.350 --> 01:23:18.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire become INF feasible in the
 
01:23:21.229 --> 01:23:21.239 align:start position:0%
market we're going to go to
 
01:23:24.709 --> 01:23:24.719 align:start position:0%
bat or it in court
 
01:23:28.750 --> 01:23:28.760 align:start position:0%
yes exactly you may not recall from the
 
01:23:31.870 --> 01:23:31.880 align:start position:0%
debate on this bill last year but this
 
01:23:34.870 --> 01:23:34.880 align:start position:0%
portion of the statute from line 24
 
01:23:39.030 --> 01:23:39.040 align:start position:0%
through to the end is already in statute
 
01:23:41.550 --> 01:23:41.560 align:start position:0%
the Senate did approve and the governor
 
01:23:45.669 --> 01:23:45.679 align:start position:0%
did sign that language into law so this
 
01:23:48.709 --> 01:23:48.719 align:start position:0%
is existing state law whyatt part of
 
01:23:52.189 --> 01:23:52.199 align:start position:0%
this bill is a you'll have to ask OSS
 
01:23:55.470 --> 01:23:55.480 align:start position:0%
about that um that was not what I
 
01:23:58.189 --> 01:23:58.199 align:start position:0%
submitted to OSS but this is what came
 
01:24:02.790 --> 01:24:02.800 align:start position:0%
back from OS so um the point of that
 
01:24:06.709 --> 01:24:06.719 align:start position:0%
section two from line 24 on is to give a
 
01:24:09.390 --> 01:24:09.400 align:start position:0%
generator who is being forced into
 
01:24:13.430 --> 01:24:13.440 align:start position:0%
premature closure or retirement by
 
01:24:16.590 --> 01:24:16.600 align:start position:0%
policies uh that probably did not
 
01:24:19.910 --> 01:24:19.920 align:start position:0%
originate in New Hampshire allows the
 
01:24:22.350 --> 01:24:22.360 align:start position:0%
generator to approach the department of
 
01:24:24.750 --> 01:24:24.760 align:start position:0%
energy and possibly even eventually the
 
01:24:27.110 --> 01:24:27.120 align:start position:0%
Department of Justice to help it defend
 
01:24:29.070 --> 01:24:29.080 align:start position:0%
itself from that
 
01:24:31.390 --> 01:24:31.400 align:start position:0%
premature uh
 
01:24:34.590 --> 01:24:34.600 align:start position:0%
closure okay uh I think we can move on
 
01:24:36.709 --> 01:24:36.719 align:start position:0%
now thank you so much for a good
 
01:24:39.990 --> 01:24:40.000 align:start position:0%
testimony I would like to next call on
 
01:24:42.109 --> 01:24:42.119 align:start position:0%
Katherine corkery from the Sierra Club
 
01:24:55.790 --> 01:24:55.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:58.750 --> 01:24:58.760 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:25:01.709 --> 01:25:01.719 align:start position:0%
um my name is Katherine corkery I
 
01:25:03.950 --> 01:25:03.960 align:start position:0%
represent the New Hampshire chapter of
 
01:25:07.229 --> 01:25:07.239 align:start position:0%
the Sierra Club it is a pleasure to be
 
01:25:11.910 --> 01:25:11.920 align:start position:0%
before this committee and um
 
01:25:15.870 --> 01:25:15.880 align:start position:0%
I am urging the committee to vote itl on
 
01:25:20.790 --> 01:25:20.800 align:start position:0%
this bill um as we heard from the lead
 
01:25:23.430 --> 01:25:23.440 align:start position:0%
sponsor this bill was introduced last
 
01:25:26.990 --> 01:25:27.000 align:start position:0%
year and and the chapter oppos the
 
01:25:31.470 --> 01:25:31.480 align:start position:0%
language then um because it is confusing
 
01:25:35.590 --> 01:25:35.600 align:start position:0%
it's contradictory and it does not in
 
01:25:40.149 --> 01:25:40.159 align:start position:0%
any way address volatile energy
 
01:25:44.990 --> 01:25:45.000 align:start position:0%
Bills first uh as we heard uh section
 
01:25:49.229 --> 01:25:49.239 align:start position:0%
Roman 2 I think it is uh is already in
 
01:25:52.430 --> 01:25:52.440 align:start position:0%
statute um it's really confusing to
 
01:25:54.550 --> 01:25:54.560 align:start position:0%
repeat statute
 
01:25:57.109 --> 01:25:57.119 align:start position:0%
um and that section is because it's in
 
01:26:00.350 --> 01:26:00.360 align:start position:0%
the bill now um is really
 
01:26:02.830 --> 01:26:02.840 align:start position:0%
problematic as we heard from
 
01:26:02.840 --> 01:26:05.070 align:start position:0%
problematic as we heard from
representative

01:26:05.070 --> 01:26:05.080 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:26:11.390 --> 01:26:11.400 align:start position:0%
rolds it is um it imagines a fictional
 
01:26:13.510 --> 01:26:13.520 align:start position:0%
Scofflaw power
 
01:26:17.470 --> 01:26:17.480 align:start position:0%
plant um that would ask and use the
 
01:26:22.149 --> 01:26:22.159 align:start position:0%
power of the sovereignty of the state to
 
01:26:25.350 --> 01:26:25.360 align:start position:0%
defend its
 
01:26:25.360 --> 01:26:27.189 align:start position:0%
defend its
illegal

01:26:27.189 --> 01:26:27.199 align:start position:0%
illegal
 
01:26:27.199 --> 01:26:30.149 align:start position:0%
illegal
action

01:26:30.149 --> 01:26:30.159 align:start position:0%
action
 
01:26:35.550 --> 01:26:35.560 align:start position:0%
um and and it also uh as a a com as a
 
01:26:38.350 --> 01:26:38.360 align:start position:0%
contradiction speaks of Market
 
01:26:43.470 --> 01:26:43.480 align:start position:0%
forces how how it provides private
 
01:26:46.229 --> 01:26:46.239 align:start position:0%
utilities and power generators the
 
01:26:48.310 --> 01:26:48.320 align:start position:0%
sovereignty of the
 
01:26:51.629 --> 01:26:51.639 align:start position:0%
state does does that sound like a Market
 
01:26:54.229 --> 01:26:54.239 align:start position:0%
Force that's really far from Market
 
01:26:54.239 --> 01:26:55.310 align:start position:0%
Force that's really far from Market
Market

01:26:55.310 --> 01:26:55.320 align:start position:0%
Market
 
01:26:58.310 --> 01:26:58.320 align:start position:0%
forces um and and if you
 
01:27:02.390 --> 01:27:02.400 align:start position:0%
continue um it also see allows
 
01:27:05.350 --> 01:27:05.360 align:start position:0%
funding from the legislative fiscal
 
01:27:09.830 --> 01:27:09.840 align:start position:0%
committee to allow doj
 
01:27:14.109 --> 01:27:14.119 align:start position:0%
or Department of energy to conduct these
 
01:27:18.590 --> 01:27:18.600 align:start position:0%
actions so you as as a citizen will be
 
01:27:24.189 --> 01:27:24.199 align:start position:0%
paying doj to defend a Scuf law power
 
01:27:24.199 --> 01:27:25.310 align:start position:0%
paying doj to defend a Scuf law power
power

01:27:25.310 --> 01:27:25.320 align:start position:0%
power
 
01:27:29.070 --> 01:27:29.080 align:start position:0%
plant that's that's what this bill
 
01:27:29.080 --> 01:27:31.550 align:start position:0%
plant that's that's what this bill
says

01:27:31.550 --> 01:27:31.560 align:start position:0%
says
 
01:27:35.790 --> 01:27:35.800 align:start position:0%
secondly uh this grouping of Statute is
 
01:27:39.590 --> 01:27:39.600 align:start position:0%
called part electric utility integrated
 
01:27:39.600 --> 01:27:41.669 align:start position:0%
called part electric utility integrated
distribution

01:27:41.669 --> 01:27:41.679 align:start position:0%
distribution
 
01:27:44.750 --> 01:27:44.760 align:start position:0%
planning why is this
 
01:27:48.669 --> 01:27:48.679 align:start position:0%
here this has nothing to do with the
 
01:27:51.750 --> 01:27:51.760 align:start position:0%
distributed distribution planning this
 
01:27:54.310 --> 01:27:54.320 align:start position:0%
is about regulating
 
01:27:58.910 --> 01:27:58.920 align:start position:0%
and or deregulating power
 
01:28:04.149 --> 01:28:04.159 align:start position:0%
plants um we're also uh well there's
 
01:28:06.390 --> 01:28:06.400 align:start position:0%
also to add to the
 
01:28:09.629 --> 01:28:09.639 align:start position:0%
confusion uh undefined
 
01:28:13.950 --> 01:28:13.960 align:start position:0%
terms what is a firm
 
01:28:16.629 --> 01:28:16.639 align:start position:0%
resource I don't know what that is it
 
01:28:19.470 --> 01:28:19.480 align:start position:0%
sounds a little mysterious to
 
01:28:23.430 --> 01:28:23.440 align:start position:0%
me and what is Affordable affordability
 
01:28:26.189 --> 01:28:26.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:30.149 --> 01:28:30.159 align:start position:0%
what is in the federal power act what is
 
01:28:31.510 --> 01:28:31.520 align:start position:0%
in the
 
01:28:37.149 --> 01:28:37.159 align:start position:0%
current uh regulations at the Pu is just
 
01:28:37.159 --> 01:28:38.310 align:start position:0%
current uh regulations at the Pu is just
and

01:28:38.310 --> 01:28:38.320 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:28:41.030 --> 01:28:41.040 align:start position:0%
reasonable that is the bar
 
01:28:45.629 --> 01:28:45.639 align:start position:0%
now and and it is known and
 
01:28:49.030 --> 01:28:49.040 align:start position:0%
useful um and and
 
01:28:53.149 --> 01:28:53.159 align:start position:0%
defendable so and uh lastly this bill is
 
01:28:55.390 --> 01:28:55.400 align:start position:0%
really unenforced able how do you
 
01:28:59.189 --> 01:28:59.199 align:start position:0%
enforce this um and and it doesn't have
 
01:29:03.070 --> 01:29:03.080 align:start position:0%
anything to do to lower energy bills for
 
01:29:05.750 --> 01:29:05.760 align:start position:0%
granite Staters and I would like to
 
01:29:09.629 --> 01:29:09.639 align:start position:0%
remind this committee that federal laws
 
01:29:13.350 --> 01:29:13.360 align:start position:0%
have improved our air and water quality
 
01:29:15.709 --> 01:29:15.719 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire and across the
 
01:29:21.350 --> 01:29:21.360 align:start position:0%
United States I I uh we know Mercury
 
01:29:23.470 --> 01:29:23.480 align:start position:0%
comes from power plants and there's a
 
01:29:25.189 --> 01:29:25.199 align:start position:0%
whole life cycle of
 
01:29:29.350 --> 01:29:29.360 align:start position:0%
mercury and when it emits from the Smoke
 
01:29:32.910 --> 01:29:32.920 align:start position:0%
Stack it it
 
01:29:37.149 --> 01:29:37.159 align:start position:0%
uh interacts with the uh atmosphere and
 
01:29:39.870 --> 01:29:39.880 align:start position:0%
because it is a metal it's heavy and so
 
01:29:44.830 --> 01:29:44.840 align:start position:0%
it deposits onto our land and into our
 
01:29:47.430 --> 01:29:47.440 align:start position:0%
water bodies and when it gets into the
 
01:29:50.790 --> 01:29:50.800 align:start position:0%
water bodies then it gets into the the
 
01:29:54.709 --> 01:29:54.719 align:start position:0%
food cycle and the food cycle gets into
 
01:29:57.910 --> 01:29:57.920 align:start position:0%
us when we eat fish because it
 
01:30:00.590 --> 01:30:00.600 align:start position:0%
bioaccumulates that means it it builds
 
01:30:05.390 --> 01:30:05.400 align:start position:0%
up in the bodies of fish and the things
 
01:30:07.750 --> 01:30:07.760 align:start position:0%
like us that eat
 
01:30:12.629 --> 01:30:12.639 align:start position:0%
fish then uh accumulate the um the
 
01:30:15.669 --> 01:30:15.679 align:start position:0%
Mercury and and Wildlife is
 
01:30:19.310 --> 01:30:19.320 align:start position:0%
not uh excluded from this uh loons who
 
01:30:23.990 --> 01:30:24.000 align:start position:0%
loves loons I love loons loons will
 
01:30:26.550 --> 01:30:26.560 align:start position:0%
build up that mercury and
 
01:30:31.030 --> 01:30:31.040 align:start position:0%
lead and uh other other uh contaminants
 
01:30:33.070 --> 01:30:33.080 align:start position:0%
and the Clean Air Act and the Clean
 
01:30:34.910 --> 01:30:34.920 align:start position:0%
Water Act has helped
 
01:30:39.550 --> 01:30:39.560 align:start position:0%
us lower those impacts investing rather
 
01:30:42.510 --> 01:30:42.520 align:start position:0%
I think it was uh repr representative
 
01:30:45.270 --> 01:30:45.280 align:start position:0%
Swanson uh investing in our local
 
01:30:47.830 --> 01:30:47.840 align:start position:0%
economy to upgrade our energy
 
01:30:52.030 --> 01:30:52.040 align:start position:0%
infrastructure is time well spent it is
 
01:30:55.109 --> 01:30:55.119 align:start position:0%
an essential strategy to protect our
 
01:30:58.629 --> 01:30:58.639 align:start position:0%
Public Safety to protect our public
 
01:31:02.470 --> 01:31:02.480 align:start position:0%
health and cut down on the future cost
 
01:31:06.070 --> 01:31:06.080 align:start position:0%
of outdated inefficient
 
01:31:08.750 --> 01:31:08.760 align:start position:0%
Technologies so I
 
01:31:12.750 --> 01:31:12.760 align:start position:0%
uh uh support efforts to upgrade our
 
01:31:15.790 --> 01:31:15.800 align:start position:0%
energy infrastructure with cleaner safer
 
01:31:18.790 --> 01:31:18.800 align:start position:0%
healthier uh energy sources that can be
 
01:31:23.550 --> 01:31:23.560 align:start position:0%
paired with battery storage to make it
 
01:31:24.950 --> 01:31:24.960 align:start position:0%
more more
 
01:31:30.070 --> 01:31:30.080 align:start position:0%
reliable and uh I I I think wasting your
 
01:31:31.950 --> 01:31:31.960 align:start position:0%
valuable time on this bill is
 
01:31:34.350 --> 01:31:34.360 align:start position:0%
misdirected and does it disservice to
 
01:31:37.109 --> 01:31:37.119 align:start position:0%
your constituents who are who are
 
01:31:39.870 --> 01:31:39.880 align:start position:0%
struggling with unreasonable energy
 
01:31:43.350 --> 01:31:43.360 align:start position:0%
rates I ask you to oppose
 
01:31:45.310 --> 01:31:45.320 align:start position:0%
hp504 thank
 
01:31:50.910 --> 01:31:50.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:54.229 --> 01:31:54.239 align:start position:0%
Corry representative Summers thank you
 
01:31:55.750 --> 01:31:55.760 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman and thank you taking my
 
01:31:57.830 --> 01:31:57.840 align:start position:0%
question um the one part I heard and
 
01:32:00.149 --> 01:32:00.159 align:start position:0%
that stuck out to me that you stated was
 
01:32:01.950 --> 01:32:01.960 align:start position:0%
the fact that this bill would be
 
01:32:04.870 --> 01:32:04.880 align:start position:0%
unenforceable and looking at section uh
 
01:32:07.709 --> 01:32:07.719 align:start position:0%
Roman numeral 2 I see the department of
 
01:32:10.030 --> 01:32:10.040 align:start position:0%
energy all the way through this whereas
 
01:32:12.629 --> 01:32:12.639 align:start position:0%
see the department of energy shall open
 
01:32:14.910 --> 01:32:14.920 align:start position:0%
an investigator docket to determine how
 
01:32:16.990 --> 01:32:17.000 align:start position:0%
such an involuntary retirement or
 
01:32:18.390 --> 01:32:18.400 align:start position:0%
decommissioning would affect the
 
01:32:20.629 --> 01:32:20.639 align:start position:0%
reliability and affordability of the
 
01:32:22.629 --> 01:32:22.639 align:start position:0%
state's energy resources and then
 
01:32:24.270 --> 01:32:24.280 align:start position:0%
secondly the department of energy and
 
01:32:26.229 --> 01:32:26.239 align:start position:0%
the Department of Justice May seek
 
01:32:28.149 --> 01:32:28.159 align:start position:0%
funding from the legislative fiscal
 
01:32:30.229 --> 01:32:30.239 align:start position:0%
committee to conduct any actions
 
01:32:34.590 --> 01:32:34.600 align:start position:0%
described within the RSA um so this this
 
01:32:36.189 --> 01:32:36.199 align:start position:0%
looks like an enforcement to me how
 
01:32:38.229 --> 01:32:38.239 align:start position:0%
would how would you see it as not
 
01:32:41.750 --> 01:32:41.760 align:start position:0%
they're they're not um I I would argue
 
01:32:43.470 --> 01:32:43.480 align:start position:0%
um I appreciate the question I would
 
01:32:46.310 --> 01:32:46.320 align:start position:0%
argue that they're not
 
01:32:49.870 --> 01:32:49.880 align:start position:0%
enforcing the law they're
 
01:32:51.950 --> 01:32:51.960 align:start position:0%
enforcing this
 
01:32:55.910 --> 01:32:55.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:58.750 --> 01:32:58.760 align:start position:0%
retirement there this fictional power
 
01:33:03.109 --> 01:33:03.119 align:start position:0%
plant that is no longer following the
 
01:33:08.229 --> 01:33:08.239 align:start position:0%
law it allows them to claim that it's
 
01:33:11.709 --> 01:33:11.719 align:start position:0%
involuntary and um this this is not
 
01:33:15.030 --> 01:33:15.040 align:start position:0%
enforcement this is about directing
 
01:33:19.030 --> 01:33:19.040 align:start position:0%
you're directing the department to do
 
01:33:21.070 --> 01:33:21.080 align:start position:0%
that further
 
01:33:24.750 --> 01:33:24.760 align:start position:0%
questions representative Kaplan
 
01:33:25.910 --> 01:33:25.920 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you Miss
 
01:33:29.109 --> 01:33:29.119 align:start position:0%
Corry for coming in today um on the
 
01:33:30.950 --> 01:33:30.960 align:start position:0%
point of enforcement I I tend to agree
 
01:33:32.510 --> 01:33:32.520 align:start position:0%
with you that I would love to see a
 
01:33:33.709 --> 01:33:33.719 align:start position:0%
legal case where the state of New
 
01:33:35.830 --> 01:33:35.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire goes up against the EPA to
 
01:33:38.550 --> 01:33:38.560 align:start position:0%
enforce its to to claim its Sovereign
 
01:33:41.030 --> 01:33:41.040 align:start position:0%
rights to the energy coming from a a
 
01:33:43.109 --> 01:33:43.119 align:start position:0%
private generator that's being sold onto
 
01:33:44.470 --> 01:33:44.480 align:start position:0%
a regional grid but I don't want to talk
 
01:33:45.790 --> 01:33:45.800 align:start position:0%
about that I wanted to ask you about
 
01:33:49.550 --> 01:33:49.560 align:start position:0%
your membership and your sense of how
 
01:33:51.950 --> 01:33:51.960 align:start position:0%
they would feel about a a state energy
 
01:33:54.149 --> 01:33:54.159 align:start position:0%
policy that would sacrifice human health
 
01:33:56.990 --> 01:33:57.000 align:start position:0%
and the physical environment in the sake
 
01:34:00.189 --> 01:34:00.199 align:start position:0%
of emphasizing so-called
 
01:34:02.590 --> 01:34:02.600 align:start position:0%
affordability thank you for the question
 
01:34:05.350 --> 01:34:05.360 align:start position:0%
I our membership we have about five
 
01:34:07.910 --> 01:34:07.920 align:start position:0%
15,000 members and supporters in the
 
01:34:11.070 --> 01:34:11.080 align:start position:0%
state they are very concerned with the
 
01:34:16.430 --> 01:34:16.440 align:start position:0%
lack of of um um diversity of energy and
 
01:34:21.070 --> 01:34:21.080 align:start position:0%
the lack of um energy Choice um what did
 
01:34:24.430 --> 01:34:24.440 align:start position:0%
we hear Yesterday $20 million
 
01:34:29.470 --> 01:34:29.480 align:start position:0%
sitting over at do doe not being
 
01:34:33.750 --> 01:34:33.760 align:start position:0%
Implement implemented as the law in New
 
01:34:33.760 --> 01:34:34.910 align:start position:0%
Implement implemented as the law in New
Hampshire

01:34:34.910 --> 01:34:34.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
01:34:40.070 --> 01:34:40.080 align:start position:0%
allows I or or the Pu pardon me um my
 
01:34:43.870 --> 01:34:43.880 align:start position:0%
members are very upset about that and my
 
01:34:48.189 --> 01:34:48.199 align:start position:0%
members are not happy about the
 
01:34:51.510 --> 01:34:51.520 align:start position:0%
pollution coming for a long time until
 
01:34:51.520 --> 01:34:54.390 align:start position:0%
pollution coming for a long time until
1996

01:34:54.390 --> 01:34:54.400 align:start position:0%
1996
 
01:34:58.669 --> 01:34:58.679 align:start position:0%
unmitigated in our state this is this is
 
01:35:03.750 --> 01:35:03.760 align:start position:0%
mercury lead dioxin sulfur soot these
 
01:35:08.390 --> 01:35:08.400 align:start position:0%
are very dangerous pollutants uh to
 
01:35:11.790 --> 01:35:11.800 align:start position:0%
humans and make matters worse for people
 
01:35:14.510 --> 01:35:14.520 align:start position:0%
with pre-existing conditions so yes
 
01:35:16.149 --> 01:35:16.159 align:start position:0%
that's that is definitely what we care
 
01:35:18.629 --> 01:35:18.639 align:start position:0%
about thank you additional questions for
 
01:35:21.790 --> 01:35:21.800 align:start position:0%
Miss Corry I know you have limited time
 
01:35:24.030 --> 01:35:24.040 align:start position:0%
so thank you
 
01:35:25.750 --> 01:35:25.760 align:start position:0%
oh representative McGee has a question I
 
01:35:27.669 --> 01:35:27.679 align:start position:0%
was kind of waiting thank you so much
 
01:35:29.390 --> 01:35:29.400 align:start position:0%
and thank you Miss cery for taking my
 
01:35:32.470 --> 01:35:32.480 align:start position:0%
question um you were talking a bit about
 
01:35:34.149 --> 01:35:34.159 align:start position:0%
the nature of the enforcement and all
 
01:35:36.229 --> 01:35:36.239 align:start position:0%
that and it sounds to me as though the
 
01:35:38.669 --> 01:35:38.679 align:start position:0%
bill is trying to get us to a place
 
01:35:41.990 --> 01:35:42.000 align:start position:0%
where we have some way to intercede if
 
01:35:45.270 --> 01:35:45.280 align:start position:0%
we see a plant that we think provides
 
01:35:49.470 --> 01:35:49.480 align:start position:0%
reliability uh needs to be uh kept
 
01:35:52.189 --> 01:35:52.199 align:start position:0%
online but the way it works with the
 
01:35:54.870 --> 01:35:54.880 align:start position:0%
regional grid isn't it true that the iso
 
01:35:56.030 --> 01:35:56.040 align:start position:0%
New England is responsible for
 
01:35:57.590 --> 01:35:57.600 align:start position:0%
reliability so wouldn't the state be
 
01:35:59.390 --> 01:35:59.400 align:start position:0%
able to go directly to them if somebody
 
01:36:00.990 --> 01:36:01.000 align:start position:0%
was going to go offline about what the
 
01:36:04.030 --> 01:36:04.040 align:start position:0%
plans were to try and you know provide
 
01:36:06.270 --> 01:36:06.280 align:start position:0%
reliability going forward and replace
 
01:36:07.990 --> 01:36:08.000 align:start position:0%
the plant with whatever else it's going
 
01:36:11.870 --> 01:36:11.880 align:start position:0%
to be thank you for the question um and
 
01:36:15.750 --> 01:36:15.760 align:start position:0%
I am no expert but I have lots of
 
01:36:21.149 --> 01:36:21.159 align:start position:0%
opinions and lots of uh um background um
 
01:36:23.790 --> 01:36:23.800 align:start position:0%
but I think the reliability question
 
01:36:26.950 --> 01:36:26.960 align:start position:0%
being on the list the top of the list of
 
01:36:30.229 --> 01:36:30.239 align:start position:0%
being unreliable is really a question
 
01:36:35.709 --> 01:36:35.719 align:start position:0%
for ISO New England um this is and um
 
01:36:39.709 --> 01:36:39.719 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire in particular has the the
 
01:36:44.990 --> 01:36:45.000 align:start position:0%
least amount of of solar and battery
 
01:36:48.830 --> 01:36:48.840 align:start position:0%
storage and weatherization and Energy
 
01:36:52.790 --> 01:36:52.800 align:start position:0%
Efficiency how could it be or let me
 
01:36:54.270 --> 01:36:54.280 align:start position:0%
pose the question
 
01:36:59.550 --> 01:36:59.560 align:start position:0%
is it because we have so little solar
 
01:37:03.270 --> 01:37:03.280 align:start position:0%
and paired with batteries so little
 
01:37:06.790 --> 01:37:06.800 align:start position:0%
weatherization and and even less Energy
 
01:37:09.590 --> 01:37:09.600 align:start position:0%
Efficiency programs maybe that's what's
 
01:37:12.669 --> 01:37:12.679 align:start position:0%
making us unreliable Miss Corry could
 
01:37:14.510 --> 01:37:14.520 align:start position:0%
you just answer the question and not
 
01:37:17.350 --> 01:37:17.360 align:start position:0%
engage in a dialogue back and forth I I
 
01:37:21.070 --> 01:37:21.080 align:start position:0%
can end now so bye okay thank you bye
 
01:37:22.270 --> 01:37:22.280 align:start position:0%
all right next up we're going to hear
 
01:37:24.750 --> 01:37:24.760 align:start position:0%
the perspective of the the granite state
 
01:37:27.629 --> 01:37:27.639 align:start position:0%
hydr Power Association and Miss Heidi
 
01:37:41.430 --> 01:37:41.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:43.750 --> 01:37:43.760 align:start position:0%
perspective good morning Mr chairman and
 
01:37:45.350 --> 01:37:45.360 align:start position:0%
members of the committee um for the
 
01:37:47.470 --> 01:37:47.480 align:start position:0%
record my name is Heidi croll um I work
 
01:37:49.629 --> 01:37:49.639 align:start position:0%
at um Jay Grimble strategic Solutions
 
01:37:50.990 --> 01:37:51.000 align:start position:0%
and I'm here today on behalf of the
 
01:37:53.189 --> 01:37:53.199 align:start position:0%
Granite State hydrop Power Association I
 
01:37:56.390 --> 01:37:56.400 align:start position:0%
assign in neutral um I was uh happy to
 
01:37:59.669 --> 01:37:59.679 align:start position:0%
hear um the prime sponsors um comments
 
01:38:02.910 --> 01:38:02.920 align:start position:0%
when presenting the bill about um uh
 
01:38:04.830 --> 01:38:04.840 align:start position:0%
perhaps including um some language
 
01:38:07.109 --> 01:38:07.119 align:start position:0%
around diversity so that was our one
 
01:38:09.550 --> 01:38:09.560 align:start position:0%
concern was that um the current um
 
01:38:12.390 --> 01:38:12.400 align:start position:0%
energy policy that we have on the books
 
01:38:15.310 --> 01:38:15.320 align:start position:0%
um mentions diversity um and this um
 
01:38:17.189 --> 01:38:17.199 align:start position:0%
draft does not I think it was you know
 
01:38:19.990 --> 01:38:20.000 align:start position:0%
perhaps an oversight um and we just
 
01:38:22.109 --> 01:38:22.119 align:start position:0%
think that um diversity does play an
 
01:38:24.470 --> 01:38:24.480 align:start position:0%
important role in these aspects that are
 
01:38:26.790 --> 01:38:26.800 align:start position:0%
being discussed around um you know
 
01:38:29.990 --> 01:38:30.000 align:start position:0%
affordability reliability um security
 
01:38:32.990 --> 01:38:33.000 align:start position:0%
Independence um and you know health and
 
01:38:35.390 --> 01:38:35.400 align:start position:0%
safety as well so um I'll be very brief
 
01:38:37.589 --> 01:38:37.599 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to take questions um but I'm
 
01:38:41.350 --> 01:38:41.360 align:start position:0%
happy to um you know continue to assist
 
01:38:43.510 --> 01:38:43.520 align:start position:0%
with the committee um as you look at
 
01:38:43.520 --> 01:38:44.669 align:start position:0%
with the committee um as you look at
potential

01:38:44.669 --> 01:38:44.679 align:start position:0%
potential
 
01:38:47.189 --> 01:38:47.199 align:start position:0%
amendments your ideas and input is
 
01:38:50.109 --> 01:38:50.119 align:start position:0%
always appreciated so thank you uh
 
01:38:53.790 --> 01:38:53.800 align:start position:0%
questions for Miss croll
 
01:38:56.270 --> 01:38:56.280 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you we'll turn next to
 
01:38:57.910 --> 01:38:57.920 align:start position:0%
Meredith Hatfield representing the
 
01:38:57.920 --> 01:39:04.310 align:start position:0%
Meredith Hatfield representing the
nature

01:39:04.310 --> 01:39:04.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:13.430 --> 01:39:13.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:16.510 --> 01:39:16.520 align:start position:0%
back good morning I'm Meredith Hatfield
 
01:39:19.229 --> 01:39:19.239 align:start position:0%
for the nature conservancy and written
 
01:39:22.030 --> 01:39:22.040 align:start position:0%
testimony hold this closer thank you uh
 
01:39:24.830 --> 01:39:24.840 align:start position:0%
written testimony is circular a in I
 
01:39:27.390 --> 01:39:27.400 align:start position:0%
will also try to be brief um we would
 
01:39:29.790 --> 01:39:29.800 align:start position:0%
urge you to oppose this bill find it
 
01:39:31.709 --> 01:39:31.719 align:start position:0%
inexpedient to legislate for the reasons
 
01:39:34.709 --> 01:39:34.719 align:start position:0%
that I won't read in our letter um
 
01:39:36.270 --> 01:39:36.280 align:start position:0%
perhaps the most important thing I've
 
01:39:38.870 --> 01:39:38.880 align:start position:0%
provided to you is the current law um
 
01:39:41.109 --> 01:39:41.119 align:start position:0%
and thank you to uh representative McGee
 
01:39:43.950 --> 01:39:43.960 align:start position:0%
for reading it um we think that that
 
01:39:46.510 --> 01:39:46.520 align:start position:0%
section New Hampshire energy policy in
 
01:39:49.310 --> 01:39:49.320 align:start position:0%
RSA 378 37 which has been on the book
 
01:39:53.550 --> 01:39:53.560 align:start position:0%
since 1990 is an elegant expression of
 
01:39:55.750 --> 01:39:55.760 align:start position:0%
um how New Hampshire has approached
 
01:39:59.070 --> 01:39:59.080 align:start position:0%
energy issues um really trying to have
 
01:40:01.709 --> 01:40:01.719 align:start position:0%
it all frankly trying to balance public
 
01:40:04.589 --> 01:40:04.599 align:start position:0%
health safety our environment as well as
 
01:40:08.030 --> 01:40:08.040 align:start position:0%
our need for um affordable reliable
 
01:40:11.390 --> 01:40:11.400 align:start position:0%
energy um as has been mentioned this
 
01:40:15.109 --> 01:40:15.119 align:start position:0%
bill was um considered last year um and
 
01:40:16.990 --> 01:40:17.000 align:start position:0%
was rejected by the Senate except for
 
01:40:19.470 --> 01:40:19.480 align:start position:0%
that one section to that um that
 
01:40:21.910 --> 01:40:21.920 align:start position:0%
actually is on the books um we really
 
01:40:23.030 --> 01:40:23.040 align:start position:0%
think this takes us in the wrong
 
01:40:26.030 --> 01:40:26.040 align:start position:0%
direction ction uh we agree with u Miss
 
01:40:27.870 --> 01:40:27.880 align:start position:0%
croll from the granite state Hydro
 
01:40:30.790 --> 01:40:30.800 align:start position:0%
Association that um fuel diversity is
 
01:40:33.189 --> 01:40:33.199 align:start position:0%
really key to reliability and that
 
01:40:35.430 --> 01:40:35.440 align:start position:0%
putting all of our eggs in one basket uh
 
01:40:37.589 --> 01:40:37.599 align:start position:0%
really isn't smart and increasing our
 
01:40:40.709 --> 01:40:40.719 align:start position:0%
dependence on imported fossil fuels
 
01:40:42.030 --> 01:40:42.040 align:start position:0%
actually doesn't increase New
 
01:40:44.629 --> 01:40:44.639 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's energy Independence and
 
01:40:47.589 --> 01:40:47.599 align:start position:0%
really allowing smaller cleaner more
 
01:40:49.950 --> 01:40:49.960 align:start position:0%
local energy sources to to continue to
 
01:40:51.510 --> 01:40:51.520 align:start position:0%
thrive which they've been doing for a
 
01:40:52.750 --> 01:40:52.760 align:start position:0%
number of years in New Hampshire is
 
01:40:55.070 --> 01:40:55.080 align:start position:0%
really the course that we we should stay
 
01:40:58.750 --> 01:40:58.760 align:start position:0%
on um very pleased to hear um chairman
 
01:41:02.350 --> 01:41:02.360 align:start position:0%
vos's openness to um perhaps considering
 
01:41:05.229 --> 01:41:05.239 align:start position:0%
some changes to his language um because
 
01:41:07.510 --> 01:41:07.520 align:start position:0%
we again agree um with Miss croll that
 
01:41:09.790 --> 01:41:09.800 align:start position:0%
it's extremely important that we
 
01:41:12.669 --> 01:41:12.679 align:start position:0%
continue to recognize the real value
 
01:41:15.030 --> 01:41:15.040 align:start position:0%
that um some of our frankly intermittent
 
01:41:16.990 --> 01:41:17.000 align:start position:0%
resources provide here in New Hampshire
 
01:41:19.750 --> 01:41:19.760 align:start position:0%
including small Hydro um but also other
 
01:41:21.750 --> 01:41:21.760 align:start position:0%
clean energy sources that people are
 
01:41:24.350 --> 01:41:24.360 align:start position:0%
using to actually increase their own
 
01:41:27.310 --> 01:41:27.320 align:start position:0%
reliability and to weather the storm if
 
01:41:29.470 --> 01:41:29.480 align:start position:0%
you will um and with that I'd be happy
 
01:41:31.910 --> 01:41:31.920 align:start position:0%
to take any questions thank you
 
01:41:33.709 --> 01:41:33.719 align:start position:0%
questions for Miss
 
01:41:37.189 --> 01:41:37.199 align:start position:0%
Hatfield representative McGee thank you
 
01:41:39.470 --> 01:41:39.480 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman and thank you Miss Hatfield
 
01:41:41.390 --> 01:41:41.400 align:start position:0%
for taking my question as you were
 
01:41:45.669 --> 01:41:45.679 align:start position:0%
speaking um I uh the thought that came
 
01:41:48.950 --> 01:41:48.960 align:start position:0%
into my mind was fuel diversity and
 
01:41:53.750 --> 01:41:53.760 align:start position:0%
costs um people are looking for ways to
 
01:41:56.470 --> 01:41:56.480 align:start position:0%
uh lower their energy costs and they're
 
01:41:59.189 --> 01:41:59.199 align:start position:0%
asking us to help them with that and so
 
01:42:01.550 --> 01:42:01.560 align:start position:0%
I know you have a long history with New
 
01:42:05.229 --> 01:42:05.239 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and demand side efforts can
 
01:42:08.189 --> 01:42:08.199 align:start position:0%
you say something about what the role
 
01:42:10.350 --> 01:42:10.360 align:start position:0%
that demand side plays and also fuel
 
01:42:12.830 --> 01:42:12.840 align:start position:0%
diversity and costs how they play into
 
01:42:15.310 --> 01:42:15.320 align:start position:0%
sort of this bill if this bill
 
01:42:17.830 --> 01:42:17.840 align:start position:0%
would have any effect on that by not
 
01:42:19.910 --> 01:42:19.920 align:start position:0%
including something like fuel diversity
 
01:42:22.550 --> 01:42:22.560 align:start position:0%
as a priority for the state yes thank
 
01:42:25.189 --> 01:42:25.199 align:start position:0%
you for the question sorry for the long
 
01:42:28.030 --> 01:42:28.040 align:start position:0%
I'll certainly try um so the language in
 
01:42:30.750 --> 01:42:30.760 align:start position:0%
our current um New Hampshire energy
 
01:42:33.270 --> 01:42:33.280 align:start position:0%
policy which is on the first page of um
 
01:42:35.390 --> 01:42:35.400 align:start position:0%
our letter but also is included in the
 
01:42:37.510 --> 01:42:37.520 align:start position:0%
attachment you know the fact that it
 
01:42:39.790 --> 01:42:39.800 align:start position:0%
says to maximize the use of cost
 
01:42:41.470 --> 01:42:41.480 align:start position:0%
effective Energy Efficiency and other
 
01:42:44.070 --> 01:42:44.080 align:start position:0%
demand side resources really has been
 
01:42:46.870 --> 01:42:46.880 align:start position:0%
helpful and important um at the Public
 
01:42:48.629 --> 01:42:48.639 align:start position:0%
Utilities Commission for example and
 
01:42:51.189 --> 01:42:51.199 align:start position:0%
trying to figure out what is the
 
01:42:54.189 --> 01:42:54.199 align:start position:0%
cheapest way to meet our energy needs as
 
01:42:58.470 --> 01:42:58.480 align:start position:0%
a state um and you heard yesterday on um
 
01:43:01.149 --> 01:43:01.159 align:start position:0%
a different bill you know that the the
 
01:43:03.310 --> 01:43:03.320 align:start position:0%
meaning of cost-effective efficiency is
 
01:43:05.310 --> 01:43:05.320 align:start position:0%
that the kilowatt hour of efficiency is
 
01:43:08.629 --> 01:43:08.639 align:start position:0%
cheaper than the kilowatt hour of supply
 
01:43:11.790 --> 01:43:11.800 align:start position:0%
and so continuing to allow customers to
 
01:43:13.669 --> 01:43:13.679 align:start position:0%
take advantage of Energy Efficiency when
 
01:43:15.790 --> 01:43:15.800 align:start position:0%
it's cheaper than Supply just makes so
 
01:43:18.189 --> 01:43:18.199 align:start position:0%
much sense you know environment aside
 
01:43:20.229 --> 01:43:20.239 align:start position:0%
although you know there are significant
 
01:43:21.950 --> 01:43:21.960 align:start position:0%
environmental benefits as well but it's
 
01:43:24.950 --> 01:43:24.960 align:start position:0%
just better for customers and as you
 
01:43:27.149 --> 01:43:27.159 align:start position:0%
mentioned I do have a long history and
 
01:43:28.589 --> 01:43:28.599 align:start position:0%
you know they say once a consumer
 
01:43:30.470 --> 01:43:30.480 align:start position:0%
Advocate always a consumer advocate so I
 
01:43:33.709 --> 01:43:33.719 align:start position:0%
can't help but but but raise that um you
 
01:43:36.629 --> 01:43:36.639 align:start position:0%
know similarly on the fuel diversity
 
01:43:39.149 --> 01:43:39.159 align:start position:0%
side in your financial portfolio you
 
01:43:40.790 --> 01:43:40.800 align:start position:0%
would not invest all of your money in
 
01:43:43.030 --> 01:43:43.040 align:start position:0%
one company right I mean that just is
 
01:43:46.870 --> 01:43:46.880 align:start position:0%
pretty broadly I think um considered
 
01:43:49.070 --> 01:43:49.080 align:start position:0%
that that would be imprudent the same
 
01:43:51.430 --> 01:43:51.440 align:start position:0%
would be true same is true for energy
 
01:43:53.589 --> 01:43:53.599 align:start position:0%
you know diversifying our mix and
 
01:43:55.589 --> 01:43:55.599 align:start position:0%
allowing people to take advantage of new
 
01:43:58.910 --> 01:43:58.920 align:start position:0%
technology is helpful for all of
 
01:44:02.229 --> 01:44:02.239 align:start position:0%
us representative Wendy Thomas thank you
 
01:44:04.550 --> 01:44:04.560 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and thank you Miss headfield
 
01:44:07.030 --> 01:44:07.040 align:start position:0%
for being here um I realize you wear
 
01:44:09.149 --> 01:44:09.159 align:start position:0%
many hats one of which is a lawyer so
 
01:44:11.950 --> 01:44:11.960 align:start position:0%
I'd like to ask you a lawyer question
 
01:44:14.589 --> 01:44:14.599 align:start position:0%
this is on page two lines six and seven
 
01:44:17.510 --> 01:44:17.520 align:start position:0%
where it says any act or Omission by a
 
01:44:19.750 --> 01:44:19.760 align:start position:0%
state agency inconsistent with this
 
01:44:23.109 --> 01:44:23.119 align:start position:0%
section shall not form the basis of any
 
01:44:25.470 --> 01:44:25.480 align:start position:0%
civil suit including but not limited to
 
01:44:27.830 --> 01:44:27.840 align:start position:0%
those seeking Equitable relief or
 
01:44:27.840 --> 01:44:29.030 align:start position:0%
those seeking Equitable relief or
claiming

01:44:29.030 --> 01:44:29.040 align:start position:0%
claiming
 
01:44:33.350 --> 01:44:33.360 align:start position:0%
damages um that to me and I am not a
 
01:44:36.070 --> 01:44:36.080 align:start position:0%
lawyer seems to set up a horrifying
 
01:44:37.990 --> 01:44:38.000 align:start position:0%
situation for public health in New
 
01:44:40.229 --> 01:44:40.239 align:start position:0%
Hampshire could you please explain the
 
01:44:42.709 --> 01:44:42.719 align:start position:0%
implications of that of those actions if
 
01:44:45.510 --> 01:44:45.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:49.149 --> 01:44:49.159 align:start position:0%
them I'm not sure I can um because as
 
01:44:51.229 --> 01:44:51.239 align:start position:0%
you say there could be many but I
 
01:44:53.589 --> 01:44:53.599 align:start position:0%
actually didn't Focus very much on
 
01:44:55.470 --> 01:44:55.480 align:start position:0%
section two of this bill because it's
 
01:44:58.350 --> 01:44:58.360 align:start position:0%
already in law um that that was the one
 
01:45:01.149 --> 01:45:01.159 align:start position:0%
part of uh House Bill 1623 last year
 
01:45:03.750 --> 01:45:03.760 align:start position:0%
that that did uh pass the Senate was
 
01:45:05.709 --> 01:45:05.719 align:start position:0%
signed into law and went into effect on
 
01:45:10.390 --> 01:45:10.400 align:start position:0%
October 1st of last year um but I think
 
01:45:13.109 --> 01:45:13.119 align:start position:0%
you know you raised some good questions
 
01:45:15.709 --> 01:45:15.719 align:start position:0%
um you know that could implicate some of
 
01:45:17.830 --> 01:45:17.840 align:start position:0%
our state agencies so hopefully they're
 
01:45:19.709 --> 01:45:19.719 align:start position:0%
thinking about that that if they have to
 
01:45:21.629 --> 01:45:21.639 align:start position:0%
implement this law you know that those
 
01:45:25.070 --> 01:45:25.080 align:start position:0%
are um things they would have to
 
01:45:29.149 --> 01:45:29.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:32.470 --> 01:45:32.480 align:start position:0%
you seeing no further questions for Miss
 
01:45:34.430 --> 01:45:34.440 align:start position:0%
Hatfield I want to thank you for
 
01:45:36.870 --> 01:45:36.880 align:start position:0%
testifying representative Summers you
 
01:45:38.390 --> 01:45:38.400 align:start position:0%
need to turn off your microphone when
 
01:45:42.229 --> 01:45:42.239 align:start position:0%
you're not using it thank you okay next
 
01:45:45.030 --> 01:45:45.040 align:start position:0%
up is um Nick crof from the conservation
 
01:46:00.669 --> 01:46:00.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:02.070 --> 01:46:02.080 align:start position:0%
hey good morning hello again I'm Nick
 
01:46:04.550 --> 01:46:04.560 align:start position:0%
cof with the conservation law Foundation
 
01:46:07.430 --> 01:46:07.440 align:start position:0%
I'm here to testify an opposition to
 
01:46:10.589 --> 01:46:10.599 align:start position:0%
hp504 um so my my first concern is that
 
01:46:12.149 --> 01:46:12.159 align:start position:0%
ostensibly the the bill would make it
 
01:46:13.550 --> 01:46:13.560 align:start position:0%
State energy policy to be
 
01:46:16.350 --> 01:46:16.360 align:start position:0%
technologically neutral um but then the
 
01:46:18.669 --> 01:46:18.679 align:start position:0%
bill places an emphasis on reliable on
 
01:46:21.790 --> 01:46:21.800 align:start position:0%
demand and firm resources and you know B
 
01:46:23.470 --> 01:46:23.480 align:start position:0%
based on the the chief response from Mr
 
01:46:26.910 --> 01:46:26.920 align:start position:0%
Chairman's um testimony you this would
 
01:46:28.189 --> 01:46:28.199 align:start position:0%
mean they would deliberately favor
 
01:46:30.910 --> 01:46:30.920 align:start position:0%
certain resources um I.E fossil fuels
 
01:46:33.430 --> 01:46:33.440 align:start position:0%
over other resources um and so that
 
01:46:35.149 --> 01:46:35.159 align:start position:0%
that's kind of just inconsistent those
 
01:46:38.709 --> 01:46:38.719 align:start position:0%
those two um Concepts and then the bill
 
01:46:41.270 --> 01:46:41.280 align:start position:0%
also assumes that affordable reliable
 
01:46:43.470 --> 01:46:43.480 align:start position:0%
and secure resources you know they're
 
01:46:45.669 --> 01:46:45.679 align:start position:0%
better for the health safety and Welfare
 
01:46:48.990 --> 01:46:49.000 align:start position:0%
of the state um but it ignores the
 
01:46:50.669 --> 01:46:50.679 align:start position:0%
health impacts of traditional fuels like
 
01:46:53.310 --> 01:46:53.320 align:start position:0%
fossil fuels um which contribute to
 
01:46:55.550 --> 01:46:55.560 align:start position:0%
asthma and other respiratory illnesses
 
01:46:59.070 --> 01:46:59.080 align:start position:0%
for our citizens and um you know one
 
01:47:01.510 --> 01:47:01.520 align:start position:0%
thing I want to point out is that I I
 
01:47:04.830 --> 01:47:04.840 align:start position:0%
think the language there um could hinder
 
01:47:07.070 --> 01:47:07.080 align:start position:0%
the state's eventual adoption of small
 
01:47:10.109 --> 01:47:10.119 align:start position:0%
nuclear um reactor Technologies as um
 
01:47:12.430 --> 01:47:12.440 align:start position:0%
smrs are currently too expensive to be
 
01:47:14.990 --> 01:47:15.000 align:start position:0%
commercially viable and so you placing
 
01:47:16.589 --> 01:47:16.599 align:start position:0%
all the emphasis on affordability could
 
01:47:18.070 --> 01:47:18.080 align:start position:0%
mean that we don't you know try to
 
01:47:21.030 --> 01:47:21.040 align:start position:0%
prioritize smrs over the next few years
 
01:47:23.550 --> 01:47:23.560 align:start position:0%
um you know finally you know this been
 
01:47:25.910 --> 01:47:25.920 align:start position:0%
mentioned fuel
 
01:47:28.030 --> 01:47:28.040 align:start position:0%
diversity um as already provided under
 
01:47:30.589 --> 01:47:30.599 align:start position:0%
the current state energy policy you know
 
01:47:32.589 --> 01:47:32.599 align:start position:0%
it results in many benefits for the
 
01:47:35.510 --> 01:47:35.520 align:start position:0%
state um first off renewable energy can
 
01:47:36.910 --> 01:47:36.920 align:start position:0%
be developed within the state which
 
01:47:39.390 --> 01:47:39.400 align:start position:0%
reduces our dependence on energy that's
 
01:47:40.870 --> 01:47:40.880 align:start position:0%
sourced from other countries other
 
01:47:42.950 --> 01:47:42.960 align:start position:0%
regions of the country and fuel
 
01:47:44.750 --> 01:47:44.760 align:start position:0%
diversity also makes us less dependent
 
01:47:48.189 --> 01:47:48.199 align:start position:0%
on fuels with very volatile um prices
 
01:47:49.990 --> 01:47:50.000 align:start position:0%
and so you know we saw really high
 
01:47:52.430 --> 01:47:52.440 align:start position:0%
energy prices two Winters ago following
 
01:47:53.470 --> 01:47:53.480 align:start position:0%
the re War
 
01:47:56.149 --> 01:47:56.159 align:start position:0%
Ukraine um you know that that was in
 
01:47:58.229 --> 01:47:58.239 align:start position:0%
large part due to the volatility of of
 
01:48:01.229 --> 01:48:01.239 align:start position:0%
fossil fuel prices then and so Studies
 
01:48:03.589 --> 01:48:03.599 align:start position:0%
have shown that more offshore wind would
 
01:48:05.030 --> 01:48:05.040 align:start position:0%
actually reduce our exposure to
 
01:48:08.030 --> 01:48:08.040 align:start position:0%
Resources with volatile prices like that
 
01:48:10.270 --> 01:48:10.280 align:start position:0%
um but you know this bill would depri
 
01:48:12.510 --> 01:48:12.520 align:start position:0%
deprioritize any efforts to achieve fuel
 
01:48:16.390 --> 01:48:16.400 align:start position:0%
diversity in our state and then another
 
01:48:18.830 --> 01:48:18.840 align:start position:0%
point is that the bill seems to assume
 
01:48:20.629 --> 01:48:20.639 align:start position:0%
that fossil fuels are much more reliable
 
01:48:23.750 --> 01:48:23.760 align:start position:0%
and dispatchable than other resources
 
01:48:25.750 --> 01:48:25.760 align:start position:0%
and you know I just want to note that
 
01:48:27.070 --> 01:48:27.080 align:start position:0%
during winter storm
 
01:48:29.589 --> 01:48:29.599 align:start position:0%
Elliott um in late
 
01:48:34.390 --> 01:48:34.400 align:start position:0%
2020 um 2023 I believe or 2022 thanks
 
01:48:36.149 --> 01:48:36.159 align:start position:0%
several natural gas and oil field power
 
01:48:38.350 --> 01:48:38.360 align:start position:0%
plants um that are Regional grid
 
01:48:40.310 --> 01:48:40.320 align:start position:0%
operator ice New England relies on for
 
01:48:42.270 --> 01:48:42.280 align:start position:0%
dispatch you know they they fail
 
01:48:44.189 --> 01:48:44.199 align:start position:0%
themselves just showing that you know
 
01:48:45.709 --> 01:48:45.719 align:start position:0%
some of the resources we assume are more
 
01:48:48.310 --> 01:48:48.320 align:start position:0%
reliable and dispatchable aren't aren't
 
01:48:52.790 --> 01:48:52.800 align:start position:0%
often um and then the bill kind of
 
01:48:55.550 --> 01:48:55.560 align:start position:0%
counts the fact that renewable resources
 
01:48:56.950 --> 01:48:56.960 align:start position:0%
and especially those with paired with
 
01:48:59.870 --> 01:48:59.880 align:start position:0%
storage um can provide reliability and
 
01:49:02.910 --> 01:49:02.920 align:start position:0%
even dispatchability benefits um there
 
01:49:04.109 --> 01:49:04.119 align:start position:0%
have been studies that show that
 
01:49:06.310 --> 01:49:06.320 align:start position:0%
increased offshore wind can reduce the
 
01:49:08.750 --> 01:49:08.760 align:start position:0%
risk of blackouts on a regional Grid in
 
01:49:11.390 --> 01:49:11.400 align:start position:0%
Winter and then ISO New England has even
 
01:49:14.950 --> 01:49:14.960 align:start position:0%
found that increased Renewables can um
 
01:49:16.550 --> 01:49:16.560 align:start position:0%
can resolve winter reliability issues
 
01:49:18.830 --> 01:49:18.840 align:start position:0%
over the next few years and then just
 
01:49:20.950 --> 01:49:20.960 align:start position:0%
just finally um I want to note that
 
01:49:23.270 --> 01:49:23.280 align:start position:0%
Renewables when combined with
 
01:49:25.790 --> 01:49:25.800 align:start position:0%
storage they're highly dispatchable
 
01:49:26.990 --> 01:49:27.000 align:start position:0%
probably more dispatchable than
 
01:49:30.390 --> 01:49:30.400 align:start position:0%
traditional combust combustion um plants
 
01:49:31.870 --> 01:49:31.880 align:start position:0%
and that you know storage can turn on
 
01:49:35.070 --> 01:49:35.080 align:start position:0%
real quickly um and you know there's a
 
01:49:36.750 --> 01:49:36.760 align:start position:0%
storage facility being constructed in
 
01:49:39.189 --> 01:49:39.199 align:start position:0%
Maine that you know is going to dispatch
 
01:49:42.470 --> 01:49:42.480 align:start position:0%
the grid 175 megawatts um so storage is
 
01:49:44.189 --> 01:49:44.199 align:start position:0%
a real viable option there if you
 
01:49:46.790 --> 01:49:46.800 align:start position:0%
prioritize dispatchability um thank you
 
01:49:48.109 --> 01:49:48.119 align:start position:0%
very much for your time and happy to
 
01:49:49.790 --> 01:49:49.800 align:start position:0%
answer any questions and I have handed
 
01:49:52.229 --> 01:49:52.239 align:start position:0%
out written um written comments as well
 
01:49:54.270 --> 01:49:54.280 align:start position:0%
that provide more detail thank
 
01:49:58.870 --> 01:49:58.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:02.109 --> 01:50:02.119 align:start position:0%
COV seeing none thank you for your
 
01:50:03.470 --> 01:50:03.480 align:start position:0%
testimony here this morning thank you
 
01:50:14.229 --> 01:50:14.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:16.189 --> 01:50:16.199 align:start position:0%
wendam thank you Mr chairman and
 
01:50:18.550 --> 01:50:18.560 align:start position:0%
committee for taking my testimony um
 
01:50:20.750 --> 01:50:20.760 align:start position:0%
John Gage Windham I oppose this bill I
 
01:50:24.070 --> 01:50:24.080 align:start position:0%
hope you will too um
 
01:50:27.350 --> 01:50:27.360 align:start position:0%
I when OSI collected public input for
 
01:50:29.550 --> 01:50:29.560 align:start position:0%
the state energy policy several years
 
01:50:32.270 --> 01:50:32.280 align:start position:0%
ago um hundreds of people weighed in
 
01:50:34.270 --> 01:50:34.280 align:start position:0%
about their wish that the state would
 
01:50:36.470 --> 01:50:36.480 align:start position:0%
invest in Energy Efficiency clean energy
 
01:50:39.629 --> 01:50:39.639 align:start position:0%
resources distributed energy resources
 
01:50:43.589 --> 01:50:43.599 align:start position:0%
and reduce our Reliance on fossil fuels
 
01:50:45.310 --> 01:50:45.320 align:start position:0%
um I think that public input was pretty
 
01:50:48.910 --> 01:50:48.920 align:start position:0%
much ignored um when the energy 10-year
 
01:50:52.830 --> 01:50:52.840 align:start position:0%
energy plan came out uh it focused on uh
 
01:50:56.069 --> 01:50:56.079 align:start position:0%
the state using the market to decide
 
01:50:59.990 --> 01:51:00.000 align:start position:0%
what we do um which I'm actually a fan
 
01:51:02.750 --> 01:51:02.760 align:start position:0%
of um the problem with the current
 
01:51:06.430 --> 01:51:06.440 align:start position:0%
energy Market is that economists from
 
01:51:09.189 --> 01:51:09.199 align:start position:0%
around the world say we are currently in
 
01:51:12.629 --> 01:51:12.639 align:start position:0%
the largest market failure uh in human
 
01:51:15.510 --> 01:51:15.520 align:start position:0%
history and this failure is the failure
 
01:51:17.790 --> 01:51:17.800 align:start position:0%
of the energy Market to account for the
 
01:51:20.629 --> 01:51:20.639 align:start position:0%
costs of the pollution from fossil fuels
 
01:51:24.550 --> 01:51:24.560 align:start position:0%
and the price of fossil fuels
 
01:51:26.830 --> 01:51:26.840 align:start position:0%
this failure to have a price signal for
 
01:51:30.430 --> 01:51:30.440 align:start position:0%
pollution in the energy Market drives
 
01:51:33.149 --> 01:51:33.159 align:start position:0%
incomplete decisions throughout the
 
01:51:36.069 --> 01:51:36.079 align:start position:0%
world and it is why we have now
 
01:51:38.550 --> 01:51:38.560 align:start position:0%
increased the carbon dioxide
 
01:51:41.510 --> 01:51:41.520 align:start position:0%
concentration in the atmosphere by 50%
 
01:51:43.589 --> 01:51:43.599 align:start position:0%
and why the world has warmed 1 degre
 
01:51:46.069 --> 01:51:46.079 align:start position:0%
celius already and is on a dangerous
 
01:51:48.270 --> 01:51:48.280 align:start position:0%
path for much more under the current
 
01:51:53.510 --> 01:51:53.520 align:start position:0%
policy mix the world is taking action in
 
01:51:57.550 --> 01:51:57.560 align:start position:0%
putting a price signal for pollution um
 
01:51:59.430 --> 01:51:59.440 align:start position:0%
there's tools that they can use that are
 
01:52:01.629 --> 01:52:01.639 align:start position:0%
going to twist the US's armed to do the
 
01:52:04.229 --> 01:52:04.239 align:start position:0%
same and I think it's dangerous then for
 
01:52:08.189 --> 01:52:08.199 align:start position:0%
the state to rely on existing Market
 
01:52:11.669 --> 01:52:11.679 align:start position:0%
forces to make our long-term energy
 
01:52:15.550 --> 01:52:15.560 align:start position:0%
decisions um we should be anticipating a
 
01:52:19.750 --> 01:52:19.760 align:start position:0%
future price on pollution a carbon price
 
01:52:23.390 --> 01:52:23.400 align:start position:0%
at the federal level um
 
01:52:25.910 --> 01:52:25.920 align:start position:0%
because the experts in climate science
 
01:52:28.870 --> 01:52:28.880 align:start position:0%
and econom economics say a global price
 
01:52:30.950 --> 01:52:30.960 align:start position:0%
is required the rest of this Century in
 
01:52:34.229 --> 01:52:34.239 align:start position:0%
order to meet safe climate goals now the
 
01:52:37.030 --> 01:52:37.040 align:start position:0%
analysis statement says this bill
 
01:52:38.950 --> 01:52:38.960 align:start position:0%
revises the state energy policy to
 
01:52:41.709 --> 01:52:41.719 align:start position:0%
promote affordable reliable and secure
 
01:52:43.430 --> 01:52:43.440 align:start position:0%
energy resources for the health safety
 
01:52:45.990 --> 01:52:46.000 align:start position:0%
and Welfare of its citizens I think
 
01:52:49.430 --> 01:52:49.440 align:start position:0%
what's missing is the word
 
01:52:52.709 --> 01:52:52.719 align:start position:0%
safe uh is one of the first things that
 
01:52:54.870 --> 01:52:54.880 align:start position:0%
the energy policy should do should be
 
01:52:58.189 --> 01:52:58.199 align:start position:0%
affordable reliable safe and secure
 
01:53:01.669 --> 01:53:01.679 align:start position:0%
energy and and if we had safe energy we
 
01:53:04.669 --> 01:53:04.679 align:start position:0%
would be accounting for the impacts of
 
01:53:07.669 --> 01:53:07.679 align:start position:0%
the pollution of our energy choices in
 
01:53:11.629 --> 01:53:11.639 align:start position:0%
state energy policy By ignoring
 
01:53:14.550 --> 01:53:14.560 align:start position:0%
pollution um because there's not a price
 
01:53:18.069 --> 01:53:18.079 align:start position:0%
on it yet we're making short-sighted
 
01:53:21.910 --> 01:53:21.920 align:start position:0%
decisions the state will lock in to a
 
01:53:25.669 --> 01:53:25.679 align:start position:0%
more depend on fossil fuels and when
 
01:53:28.229 --> 01:53:28.239 align:start position:0%
there is a price on pollution from above
 
01:53:30.990 --> 01:53:31.000 align:start position:0%
we will be stuck with stranded assets so
 
01:53:33.109 --> 01:53:33.119 align:start position:0%
I agree with the previous speakers that
 
01:53:37.069 --> 01:53:37.079 align:start position:0%
that say this is um flooded in many ways
 
01:53:38.790 --> 01:53:38.800 align:start position:0%
um it's internally
 
01:53:42.390 --> 01:53:42.400 align:start position:0%
inconsistent um saying that we
 
01:53:45.950 --> 01:53:45.960 align:start position:0%
will allow Market forces to drive things
 
01:53:47.910 --> 01:53:47.920 align:start position:0%
but then uh we're going to have an
 
01:53:50.470 --> 01:53:50.480 align:start position:0%
emphasis on reliable on demand and firm
 
01:53:52.870 --> 01:53:52.880 align:start position:0%
resources and as I understand firm means
 
01:53:55.350 --> 01:53:55.360 align:start position:0%
fossil fuels or nuclear which is
 
01:53:57.750 --> 01:53:57.760 align:start position:0%
definitely a important part of our
 
01:54:00.310 --> 01:54:00.320 align:start position:0%
Energy Mix but if the state is going to
 
01:54:02.470 --> 01:54:02.480 align:start position:0%
be putting its thumb down in favor of
 
01:54:06.709 --> 01:54:06.719 align:start position:0%
fossil fuels um because market prices
 
01:54:09.830 --> 01:54:09.840 align:start position:0%
right now show them to be um preferable
 
01:54:11.709 --> 01:54:11.719 align:start position:0%
I think that's a mistake we should be
 
01:54:12.990 --> 01:54:13.000 align:start position:0%
looking at what's happening around the
 
01:54:15.750 --> 01:54:15.760 align:start position:0%
rest of the world I passed out a
 
01:54:18.990 --> 01:54:19.000 align:start position:0%
one-pager uh two weeks ago in testimony
 
01:54:22.709 --> 01:54:22.719 align:start position:0%
of HB 306 titled the growing us carbon
 
01:54:26.069 --> 01:54:26.079 align:start position:0%
price gap which is my collection of
 
01:54:28.629 --> 01:54:28.639 align:start position:0%
information that leads me to believe
 
01:54:30.149 --> 01:54:30.159 align:start position:0%
that a carbon price at the federal level
 
01:54:33.189 --> 01:54:33.199 align:start position:0%
is coming soon um so please oppose this
 
01:54:35.950 --> 01:54:35.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:39.709 --> 01:54:39.719 align:start position:0%
you thank you questions for Mr Gage
 
01:54:41.189 --> 01:54:41.199 align:start position:0%
seeing none I want to thank you for your
 
01:54:41.199 --> 01:54:42.870 align:start position:0%
seeing none I want to thank you for your
testimony

01:54:42.870 --> 01:54:42.880 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
01:54:45.270 --> 01:54:45.280 align:start position:0%
and representative swanman has a
 
01:54:47.629 --> 01:54:47.639 align:start position:0%
question uh sorry to be slow uh thank
 
01:54:51.189 --> 01:54:51.199 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and thank you Mr Gage uh
 
01:54:54.510 --> 01:54:54.520 align:start position:0%
quick question regarding uh the the cost
 
01:54:56.790 --> 01:54:56.800 align:start position:0%
you're referring to are are you saying
 
01:55:00.189 --> 01:55:00.199 align:start position:0%
then that despite High startup costs
 
01:55:02.510 --> 01:55:02.520 align:start position:0%
Technologies offer the potential in the
 
01:55:05.550 --> 01:55:05.560 align:start position:0%
future for reducing our dependence on
 
01:55:10.069 --> 01:55:10.079 align:start position:0%
existing Legacy sources and may end up
 
01:55:11.790 --> 01:55:11.800 align:start position:0%
costing Less in the
 
01:55:15.550 --> 01:55:15.560 align:start position:0%
future definitely that's the case of
 
01:55:17.830 --> 01:55:17.840 align:start position:0%
Technology not just of energy but lots
 
01:55:19.790 --> 01:55:19.800 align:start position:0%
of energy the the government makes
 
01:55:21.589 --> 01:55:21.599 align:start position:0%
Investments you know whether it's for
 
01:55:25.550 --> 01:55:25.560 align:start position:0%
space or nuclear or the internet uh
 
01:55:28.310 --> 01:55:28.320 align:start position:0%
develops a market and then free market
 
01:55:30.709 --> 01:55:30.719 align:start position:0%
takes over and and puts those things to
 
01:55:33.189 --> 01:55:33.199 align:start position:0%
to use and and we use them so renewable
 
01:55:35.189 --> 01:55:35.199 align:start position:0%
energy is in the same curve where we
 
01:55:37.470 --> 01:55:37.480 align:start position:0%
need to invest in Energy Efficiency and
 
01:55:39.750 --> 01:55:39.760 align:start position:0%
distributed energy resources now it will
 
01:55:42.910 --> 01:55:42.920 align:start position:0%
lead to um cheaper energy in the future
 
01:55:44.430 --> 01:55:44.440 align:start position:0%
follow-up question Mr
 
01:55:47.870 --> 01:55:47.880 align:start position:0%
chair followup so then would you say
 
01:55:51.830 --> 01:55:51.840 align:start position:0%
that this bill discourages investments
 
01:55:53.870 --> 01:55:53.880 align:start position:0%
in new
 
01:55:56.709 --> 01:55:56.719 align:start position:0%
technologies yes this is I in my opinion
 
01:55:58.990 --> 01:55:59.000 align:start position:0%
a very backwards looking Bill fossil
 
01:56:01.830 --> 01:56:01.840 align:start position:0%
fuels were the best energy Choice last
 
01:56:05.430 --> 01:56:05.440 align:start position:0%
century this Century the leaders of the
 
01:56:08.310 --> 01:56:08.320 align:start position:0%
next change in h human civilization the
 
01:56:10.550 --> 01:56:10.560 align:start position:0%
evolution of how we make things better
 
01:56:13.470 --> 01:56:13.480 align:start position:0%
in the world is clean energy uh and
 
01:56:16.149 --> 01:56:16.159 align:start position:0%
Energy Efficiency is part of that um we
 
01:56:18.390 --> 01:56:18.400 align:start position:0%
can use less energy and we can get it
 
01:56:21.510 --> 01:56:21.520 align:start position:0%
from clean sources protecting our safety
 
01:56:24.109 --> 01:56:24.119 align:start position:0%
and leading the world and the technology
 
01:56:27.030 --> 01:56:27.040 align:start position:0%
um of the next change to to drive the
 
01:56:39.270 --> 01:56:39.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:41.550 --> 01:56:41.560 align:start position:0%
energy okay seeing no more questions I
 
01:56:43.790 --> 01:56:43.800 align:start position:0%
want to thank you for your testimony and
 
01:56:46.030 --> 01:56:46.040 align:start position:0%
we have
 
01:56:49.589 --> 01:56:49.599 align:start position:0%
uh representative McFarland who would
 
01:56:51.229 --> 01:56:51.239 align:start position:0%
like to testify
 
01:56:53.210 --> 01:56:53.220 align:start position:0%
in support of this
 
01:56:53.220 --> 01:56:56.229 align:start position:0%
in support of this
[Music]

01:56:56.229 --> 01:56:56.239 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:56:58.430 --> 01:56:58.440 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you Mr chairman
 
01:57:01.669 --> 01:57:01.679 align:start position:0%
representative McFarland from Orange I I
 
01:57:03.069 --> 01:57:03.079 align:start position:0%
I'm sure you've already heard a lot of
 
01:57:05.390 --> 01:57:05.400 align:start position:0%
testimony on this bill so I will keep it
 
01:57:07.270 --> 01:57:07.280 align:start position:0%
brief I'm one of the co-sponsors I
 
01:57:11.270 --> 01:57:11.280 align:start position:0%
support this bill strongly uh if I know
 
01:57:15.390 --> 01:57:15.400 align:start position:0%
uh that energy is key to our economy and
 
01:57:19.270 --> 01:57:19.280 align:start position:0%
that we do not have GDP without energy
 
01:57:22.430 --> 01:57:22.440 align:start position:0%
and that we have residents in this state
 
01:57:25.069 --> 01:57:25.079 align:start position:0%
who are struggling to make ends
 
01:57:28.350 --> 01:57:28.360 align:start position:0%
meet I would urge you to support this
 
01:57:31.109 --> 01:57:31.119 align:start position:0%
bill as I to pass and I would tell you
 
01:57:35.270 --> 01:57:35.280 align:start position:0%
that uh fossil fuels are at the moment a
 
01:57:38.390 --> 01:57:38.400 align:start position:0%
very necessary part of a sensible energy
 
01:57:41.149 --> 01:57:41.159 align:start position:0%
policy uh happy to Y
 
01:57:43.189 --> 01:57:43.199 align:start position:0%
questions any questions for
 
01:57:43.199 --> 01:57:44.629 align:start position:0%
questions any questions for
representative

01:57:44.629 --> 01:57:44.639 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:57:47.910 --> 01:57:47.920 align:start position:0%
McFarland representative Summers thank
 
01:57:49.189 --> 01:57:49.199 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman and thank you
 
01:57:52.310 --> 01:57:52.320 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question um
 
01:57:54.229 --> 01:57:54.239 align:start position:0%
would you agree with the current we were
 
01:57:58.589 --> 01:57:58.599 align:start position:0%
the testimony oh sorry excuse me uh
 
01:58:00.870 --> 01:58:00.880 align:start position:0%
disregard that within the testimony that
 
01:58:02.470 --> 01:58:02.480 align:start position:0%
we've heard today we've heard that it
 
01:58:06.069 --> 01:58:06.079 align:start position:0%
would have a global economic impact and
 
01:58:10.990 --> 01:58:11.000 align:start position:0%
with this I I do agree in somewhat
 
01:58:15.390 --> 01:58:15.400 align:start position:0%
um would you say that a Canada's
 
01:58:17.629 --> 01:58:17.639 align:start position:0%
Downfall with their economic structure
 
01:58:19.790 --> 01:58:19.800 align:start position:0%
right now is en tied to the carbon tax
 
01:58:21.390 --> 01:58:21.400 align:start position:0%
right now where they struggle with their
 
01:58:23.750 --> 01:58:23.760 align:start position:0%
Canadian dollar impact with the carbon
 
01:58:24.990 --> 01:58:25.000 align:start position:0%
tax that they're currently struggling
 
01:58:28.310 --> 01:58:28.320 align:start position:0%
with and is this a main political and
 
01:58:29.709 --> 01:58:29.719 align:start position:0%
environmental faction that they're
 
01:58:31.870 --> 01:58:31.880 align:start position:0%
dealing with in Canada you don't have to
 
01:58:33.950 --> 01:58:33.960 align:start position:0%
answer that because that's not directly
 
01:58:35.629 --> 01:58:35.639 align:start position:0%
relevant to the
 
01:58:38.950 --> 01:58:38.960 align:start position:0%
bill are there any other questions
 
01:58:38.960 --> 01:58:40.790 align:start position:0%
bill are there any other questions
representative

01:58:40.790 --> 01:58:40.800 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:58:43.390 --> 01:58:43.400 align:start position:0%
Kaplan thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
01:58:46.390 --> 01:58:46.400 align:start position:0%
for coming in representative um in your
 
01:58:47.709 --> 01:58:47.719 align:start position:0%
opening in your statement just now you
 
01:58:49.750 --> 01:58:49.760 align:start position:0%
mentioned that fossil fuels are uh
 
01:58:52.990 --> 01:58:53.000 align:start position:0%
currently right now at the moment uh
 
01:58:56.069 --> 01:58:56.079 align:start position:0%
the most you know viable fuel source
 
01:58:58.310 --> 01:58:58.320 align:start position:0%
energy source F I don't think I said the
 
01:59:00.189 --> 01:59:00.199 align:start position:0%
most I said that they are an essential
 
01:59:01.750 --> 01:59:01.760 align:start position:0%
part an essential part and I I would
 
01:59:04.510 --> 01:59:04.520 align:start position:0%
agree with that um especially the right
 
01:59:06.390 --> 01:59:06.400 align:start position:0%
now part because I think the Energy Mix
 
01:59:07.870 --> 01:59:07.880 align:start position:0%
is changing if you look at the market
 
01:59:09.550 --> 01:59:09.560 align:start position:0%
around the country around the world that
 
01:59:11.510 --> 01:59:11.520 align:start position:0%
that energy mix is definitely trending
 
01:59:14.470 --> 01:59:14.480 align:start position:0%
towards clean energy uh so how would
 
01:59:16.470 --> 01:59:16.480 align:start position:0%
this bill protect the state in coming
 
01:59:18.830 --> 01:59:18.840 align:start position:0%
years against price
 
01:59:21.709 --> 01:59:21.719 align:start position:0%
instability yeah and I I think it's a
 
01:59:24.870 --> 01:59:24.880 align:start position:0%
complex question as you all know um I'll
 
01:59:27.510 --> 01:59:27.520 align:start position:0%
try and narrow the question uh so that
 
01:59:29.229 --> 01:59:29.239 align:start position:0%
it's something I can answer without
 
01:59:32.310 --> 01:59:32.320 align:start position:0%
taking the rest of the day on you talked
 
01:59:34.510 --> 01:59:34.520 align:start position:0%
about the trend towards clean energy I
 
01:59:37.790 --> 01:59:37.800 align:start position:0%
am very supportive of clean renewable
 
01:59:42.550 --> 01:59:42.560 align:start position:0%
energy uh such as uh nuclear and we need
 
01:59:47.390 --> 01:59:47.400 align:start position:0%
uh in the near term to start work on uh
 
01:59:50.990 --> 01:59:51.000 align:start position:0%
the more than any one legislative
 
01:59:54.149 --> 01:59:54.159 align:start position:0%
session uh duration of work that is
 
01:59:56.870 --> 01:59:56.880 align:start position:0%
entailed in bringing uh new investment
 
01:59:59.550 --> 01:59:59.560 align:start position:0%
into nuclear and uh giving the
 
02:00:01.990 --> 02:00:02.000 align:start position:0%
confidence to the nuclear energy
 
02:00:04.390 --> 02:00:04.400 align:start position:0%
companies that they can make those
 
02:00:06.589 --> 02:00:06.599 align:start position:0%
Investments without seeing them torn out
 
02:00:10.910 --> 02:00:10.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:10.920 --> 02:00:13.229 align:start position:0%
 
Carter

02:00:13.229 --> 02:00:13.239 align:start position:0%
Carter
 
02:00:16.430 --> 02:00:16.440 align:start position:0%
followup yeah I mean sorry with all due
 
02:00:17.550 --> 02:00:17.560 align:start position:0%
respect you didn't really answer my
 
02:00:21.149 --> 02:00:21.159 align:start position:0%
question I mean uh how does this bill
 
02:00:22.550 --> 02:00:22.560 align:start position:0%
could you restate the question yeah how
 
02:00:24.350 --> 02:00:24.360 align:start position:0%
does this build that which places its
 
02:00:26.870 --> 02:00:26.880 align:start position:0%
thumb on Legacy fossil fuel
 
02:00:29.750 --> 02:00:29.760 align:start position:0%
production uh guarantee the state uh
 
02:00:31.790 --> 02:00:31.800 align:start position:0%
protection against price instability in
 
02:00:31.800 --> 02:00:33.830 align:start position:0%
protection against price instability in
coming

02:00:33.830 --> 02:00:33.840 align:start position:0%
coming
 
02:00:36.550 --> 02:00:36.560 align:start position:0%
years I I think if you look at the
 
02:00:39.109 --> 02:00:39.119 align:start position:0%
energy policy that's espoused in this
 
02:00:43.950 --> 02:00:43.960 align:start position:0%
bill uh it represents a balance between
 
02:00:46.390 --> 02:00:46.400 align:start position:0%
the different things that are necessary
 
02:00:48.430 --> 02:00:48.440 align:start position:0%
uh and important to the the residents of
 
02:00:49.950 --> 02:00:49.960 align:start position:0%
this state as I said earlier cost of
 
02:00:52.589 --> 02:00:52.599 align:start position:0%
living is is a huge issue and I think
 
02:00:55.510 --> 02:00:55.520 align:start position:0%
that this change to policy uh would be
 
02:00:58.830 --> 02:00:58.840 align:start position:0%
very beneficial um I I realize that I
 
02:00:59.990 --> 02:01:00.000 align:start position:0%
you may not think I've answered your
 
02:01:02.229 --> 02:01:02.239 align:start position:0%
question I I feel that uh it is a
 
02:01:03.830 --> 02:01:03.840 align:start position:0%
complex question and I know that there
 
02:01:05.950 --> 02:01:05.960 align:start position:0%
are uh gentlemen around the table here
 
02:01:09.470 --> 02:01:09.480 align:start position:0%
and ladies who uh understand this deeply
 
02:01:10.709 --> 02:01:10.719 align:start position:0%
thank you for your answer I appreciate
 
02:01:13.870 --> 02:01:13.880 align:start position:0%
it thank you okay seeing no more
 
02:01:16.310 --> 02:01:16.320 align:start position:0%
questions representative sponson has a
 
02:01:18.750 --> 02:01:18.760 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair uh thank you
 
02:01:22.709 --> 02:01:22.719 align:start position:0%
Mr McFarland uh quickly uh you mentioned
 
02:01:27.709 --> 02:01:27.719 align:start position:0%
that you favor nuclear energy but uh my
 
02:01:30.910 --> 02:01:30.920 align:start position:0%
understanding is that this bill promotes
 
02:01:33.669 --> 02:01:33.679 align:start position:0%
the cheapest way to go and would nuclear
 
02:01:35.750 --> 02:01:35.760 align:start position:0%
energy at least as far as a startup
 
02:01:37.629 --> 02:01:37.639 align:start position:0%
wouldn't that cost a lot more and would
 
02:01:39.430 --> 02:01:39.440 align:start position:0%
this bill discourage
 
02:01:42.750 --> 02:01:42.760 align:start position:0%
that yeah great great question and I I
 
02:01:45.390 --> 02:01:45.400 align:start position:0%
would say to you first of all uh I
 
02:01:48.830 --> 02:01:48.840 align:start position:0%
support a mix of energy sources I
 
02:01:51.510 --> 02:01:51.520 align:start position:0%
support a mix of energy sources that is
 
02:01:55.750 --> 02:01:55.760 align:start position:0%
able to produce a resilient grid uh and
 
02:01:59.870 --> 02:01:59.880 align:start position:0%
a reliable grid and we need to have
 
02:02:03.149 --> 02:02:03.159 align:start position:0%
lowcost energy uh I'm not aware that
 
02:02:06.870 --> 02:02:06.880 align:start position:0%
there is a benefactor who is looking to
 
02:02:08.990 --> 02:02:09.000 align:start position:0%
subsidize all energy throughout New
 
02:02:11.830 --> 02:02:11.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh so that we can have
 
02:02:13.470 --> 02:02:13.480 align:start position:0%
whatever energy sources that that
 
02:02:15.669 --> 02:02:15.679 align:start position:0%
various people might dream of uh
 
02:02:18.270 --> 02:02:18.280 align:start position:0%
therefore economics plays a very big
 
02:02:22.390 --> 02:02:22.400 align:start position:0%
part in that um at the moment fossil
 
02:02:27.229 --> 02:02:27.239 align:start position:0%
fuels are the most convenient and and
 
02:02:31.350 --> 02:02:31.360 align:start position:0%
densest and and you know easiest way of
 
02:02:34.270 --> 02:02:34.280 align:start position:0%
having fuel in your vehicles uh having
 
02:02:36.830 --> 02:02:36.840 align:start position:0%
fuel for p plants like natural gas based
 
02:02:40.629 --> 02:02:40.639 align:start position:0%
pea plants uh and nuclear is a very good
 
02:02:44.149 --> 02:02:44.159 align:start position:0%
solution for Basel load um we have made
 
02:02:46.069 --> 02:02:46.079 align:start position:0%
changes in this state and are continuing
 
02:02:50.069 --> 02:02:50.079 align:start position:0%
to make changes uh as a result of our
 
02:02:52.189 --> 02:02:52.199 align:start position:0%
commitments to ISO New England and to
 
02:02:56.270 --> 02:02:56.280 align:start position:0%
Reggie uh which are weakening the
 
02:02:58.270 --> 02:02:58.280 align:start position:0%
reliability of our electricity
 
02:03:01.069 --> 02:03:01.079 align:start position:0%
generation uh and that is of concern to
 
02:03:03.470 --> 02:03:03.480 align:start position:0%
me so my the answer to your question is
 
02:03:06.790 --> 02:03:06.800 align:start position:0%
that my Prime concern is cheap energy
 
02:03:09.229 --> 02:03:09.239 align:start position:0%
for our constituents and a secondary
 
02:03:11.669 --> 02:03:11.679 align:start position:0%
concern is achieving reliability in our
 
02:03:14.910 --> 02:03:14.920 align:start position:0%
grid thank you Mr thank you Mr chair
 
02:03:16.990 --> 02:03:17.000 align:start position:0%
thank you representative McFarland
 
02:03:18.910 --> 02:03:18.920 align:start position:0%
appreciate your testimony here today
 
02:03:20.510 --> 02:03:20.520 align:start position:0%
representative McGee would like to ask
 
02:03:22.990 --> 02:03:23.000 align:start position:0%
you a question yep thank you you you
 
02:03:25.750 --> 02:03:25.760 align:start position:0%
tried to get away but thank you for your
 
02:03:27.470 --> 02:03:27.480 align:start position:0%
time and thank you for your testimony
 
02:03:28.990 --> 02:03:29.000 align:start position:0%
and I think everyone around the table
 
02:03:30.709 --> 02:03:30.719 align:start position:0%
shares your concerns as well I mean
 
02:03:32.229 --> 02:03:32.239 align:start position:0%
that's that's our business here on this
 
02:03:34.510 --> 02:03:34.520 align:start position:0%
committee I was going to ask whether you
 
02:03:38.069 --> 02:03:38.079 align:start position:0%
were aware of the statute that this bill
 
02:03:40.550 --> 02:03:40.560 align:start position:0%
would propose to replace in terms of the
 
02:03:43.589 --> 02:03:43.599 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire energy policy that it
 
02:03:47.270 --> 02:03:47.280 align:start position:0%
emphasizes uh the lowest reasonable cost
 
02:03:49.669 --> 02:03:49.679 align:start position:0%
reliability diversity of energy sources
 
02:03:51.870 --> 02:03:51.880 align:start position:0%
which we've had testimony here today
 
02:03:54.750 --> 02:03:54.760 align:start position:0%
people would like to ensure is preserved
 
02:03:57.709 --> 02:03:57.719 align:start position:0%
because there's a value and U and an
 
02:04:00.510 --> 02:04:00.520 align:start position:0%
assist in lowering costs and our having
 
02:04:03.669 --> 02:04:03.679 align:start position:0%
Choice um all of those things uh
 
02:04:06.030 --> 02:04:06.040 align:start position:0%
reliability cost Effectiveness demand
 
02:04:07.990 --> 02:04:08.000 align:start position:0%
side resources they're all listed in the
 
02:04:09.549 --> 02:04:09.559 align:start position:0%
existing energy
 
02:04:14.109 --> 02:04:14.119 align:start position:0%
policy um so I guess the question is H
 
02:04:16.910 --> 02:04:16.920 align:start position:0%
how do you see this bill as improving
 
02:04:19.549 --> 02:04:19.559 align:start position:0%
upon something that we've had
 
02:04:23.310 --> 02:04:23.320 align:start position:0%
for decades as as our as our general you
 
02:04:26.350 --> 02:04:26.360 align:start position:0%
know State policy sure well first of all
 
02:04:27.629 --> 02:04:27.639 align:start position:0%
let me confess to The Honorable lady
 
02:04:30.350 --> 02:04:30.360 align:start position:0%
that I have read both the existing
 
02:04:33.510 --> 02:04:33.520 align:start position:0%
statute uh and the bill in some detail
 
02:04:34.990 --> 02:04:35.000 align:start position:0%
and it's been a few weeks since I read
 
02:04:36.629 --> 02:04:36.639 align:start position:0%
it so I don't have it on the tip of my
 
02:04:38.589 --> 02:04:38.599 align:start position:0%
mind but I will tell you that as you
 
02:04:40.870 --> 02:04:40.880 align:start position:0%
look through the changes that are in
 
02:04:43.109 --> 02:04:43.119 align:start position:0%
this bill I believe they are changes
 
02:04:44.910 --> 02:04:44.920 align:start position:0%
that are for the benefit of our
 
02:04:47.149 --> 02:04:47.159 align:start position:0%
residents and and uh for New Hampshire
 
02:04:48.750 --> 02:04:48.760 align:start position:0%
in the long
 
02:04:52.030 --> 02:04:52.040 align:start position:0%
term okay followup followup is there is
 
02:04:54.589 --> 02:04:54.599 align:start position:0%
there anything specific you can point us
 
02:04:57.350 --> 02:04:57.360 align:start position:0%
to um I I think I've already said that
 
02:04:58.950 --> 02:04:58.960 align:start position:0%
one of the most important things from my
 
02:05:01.510 --> 02:05:01.520 align:start position:0%
point of view is achieving cheap
 
02:05:04.549 --> 02:05:04.559 align:start position:0%
reliable energy in order to bring down
 
02:05:06.709 --> 02:05:06.719 align:start position:0%
people's cost of living and in order to
 
02:05:09.950 --> 02:05:09.960 align:start position:0%
ensure the longevity of our energy
 
02:05:12.910 --> 02:05:12.920 align:start position:0%
Supply and uh to make sure that we do
 
02:05:16.030 --> 02:05:16.040 align:start position:0%
not run into systemic issues uh in the
 
02:05:17.990 --> 02:05:18.000 align:start position:0%
future thank you I don't need to any
 
02:05:18.000 --> 02:05:19.030 align:start position:0%
future thank you I don't need to any
further

02:05:19.030 --> 02:05:19.040 align:start position:0%
further
 
02:05:22.589 --> 02:05:22.599 align:start position:0%
questions okay thank you appreciate it
 
02:05:24.350 --> 02:05:24.360 align:start position:0%
and the last word on this bill is going
 
02:05:27.790 --> 02:05:27.800 align:start position:0%
to go to uh commissioner Chris Elms of
 
02:05:33.109 --> 02:05:33.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:35.950 --> 02:05:35.960 align:start position:0%
energy good morning uh commissioner
 
02:05:38.229 --> 02:05:38.239 align:start position:0%
welcome good morning Mr chairman members
 
02:05:39.790 --> 02:05:39.800 align:start position:0%
of the committee for the record Deputy
 
02:05:41.109 --> 02:05:41.119 align:start position:0%
Commissioner Chris Elms of the New
 
02:05:44.189 --> 02:05:44.199 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Department of energy uh the
 
02:05:45.870 --> 02:05:45.880 align:start position:0%
department of energy is neutral on House
 
02:05:48.629 --> 02:05:48.639 align:start position:0%
Bill 504 but we uh are comfortable with
 
02:05:51.470 --> 02:05:51.480 align:start position:0%
it and we do have some comments um you
 
02:05:53.470 --> 02:05:53.480 align:start position:0%
know as you heard sections two and three
 
02:05:54.910 --> 02:05:54.920 align:start position:0%
are current laws so I'm not going to
 
02:05:56.629 --> 02:05:56.639 align:start position:0%
spend time on that but would recommend
 
02:05:58.430 --> 02:05:58.440 align:start position:0%
that the committee consider striking
 
02:06:00.629 --> 02:06:00.639 align:start position:0%
that from this bill as it's already
 
02:06:03.030 --> 02:06:03.040 align:start position:0%
State Statute uh the first section of
 
02:06:04.990 --> 02:06:05.000 align:start position:0%
the bill is a statute is is a rewrite of
 
02:06:07.310 --> 02:06:07.320 align:start position:0%
the statutory State energy policy and
 
02:06:08.990 --> 02:06:09.000 align:start position:0%
obviously that is the legislature's
 
02:06:11.030 --> 02:06:11.040 align:start position:0%
prerogative to dictate uh you know
 
02:06:14.430 --> 02:06:14.440 align:start position:0%
broadly the state uh energy policy uh
 
02:06:16.950 --> 02:06:16.960 align:start position:0%
and that helps guide uh the directions
 
02:06:18.830 --> 02:06:18.840 align:start position:0%
that policy makers and and uh the
 
02:06:20.990 --> 02:06:21.000 align:start position:0%
executive branch are going to take in
 
02:06:23.830 --> 02:06:23.840 align:start position:0%
relation to energy policy um and
 
02:06:28.030 --> 02:06:28.040 align:start position:0%
although the 378 37 statute is not in
 
02:06:29.990 --> 02:06:30.000 align:start position:0%
and of itself going to be immediately
 
02:06:32.229 --> 02:06:32.239 align:start position:0%
effectual on any particular program or
 
02:06:33.950 --> 02:06:33.960 align:start position:0%
funding source there is there are two
 
02:06:37.430 --> 02:06:37.440 align:start position:0%
Realms within you know the Doe's areas
 
02:06:39.629 --> 02:06:39.639 align:start position:0%
of responsibility where I will see or
 
02:06:41.390 --> 02:06:41.400 align:start position:0%
where I will say that there is a an
 
02:06:43.270 --> 02:06:43.280 align:start position:0%
immediate impact that we would would uh
 
02:06:45.549 --> 02:06:45.559 align:start position:0%
take into account as you heard in our
 
02:06:47.510 --> 02:06:47.520 align:start position:0%
intro presentation we have another
 
02:06:50.990 --> 02:06:51.000 align:start position:0%
statutory mandate under 374 f8 which is
 
02:06:53.750 --> 02:06:53.760 align:start position:0%
our uh our mandate from the legislature
 
02:06:55.750 --> 02:06:55.760 align:start position:0%
to our advocate for New Hampshire's
 
02:06:58.510 --> 02:06:58.520 align:start position:0%
positions regionally and and to Advocate
 
02:07:01.589 --> 02:07:01.599 align:start position:0%
against uh other states policy decisions
 
02:07:03.109 --> 02:07:03.119 align:start position:0%
or the shifting of costs of those
 
02:07:05.350 --> 02:07:05.360 align:start position:0%
decisions uh when they're not in
 
02:07:06.750 --> 02:07:06.760 align:start position:0%
compliance with New Hampshire's energy
 
02:07:10.830 --> 02:07:10.840 align:start position:0%
policy so so uh you know obviously what
 
02:07:13.629 --> 02:07:13.639 align:start position:0%
you do here will impact those directions
 
02:07:15.430 --> 02:07:15.440 align:start position:0%
and we use that law frequently in our in
 
02:07:17.750 --> 02:07:17.760 align:start position:0%
our uh conversations collaborations
 
02:07:19.709 --> 02:07:19.719 align:start position:0%
discussions and negotiations with uh the
 
02:07:21.589 --> 02:07:21.599 align:start position:0%
other New England states who make up the
 
02:07:24.069 --> 02:07:24.079 align:start position:0%
ISO New England grid and we point to
 
02:07:25.910 --> 02:07:25.920 align:start position:0%
this law and say hey we we're here we
 
02:07:27.870 --> 02:07:27.880 align:start position:0%
have to argue against your policies
 
02:07:29.870 --> 02:07:29.880 align:start position:0%
because they are not uh in line with
 
02:07:32.750 --> 02:07:32.760 align:start position:0%
ours so whatever you do here uh it does
 
02:07:35.229 --> 02:07:35.239 align:start position:0%
impact how we take that the other area
 
02:07:37.069 --> 02:07:37.079 align:start position:0%
uh within our purview uh where I could
 
02:07:39.510 --> 02:07:39.520 align:start position:0%
see this being impactful is the uh
 
02:07:41.629 --> 02:07:41.639 align:start position:0%
update of the 10-year State energy
 
02:07:44.510 --> 02:07:44.520 align:start position:0%
strategy um you know we are directed to
 
02:07:46.189 --> 02:07:46.199 align:start position:0%
write that and that obviously does have
 
02:07:47.870 --> 02:07:47.880 align:start position:0%
impacts on the executive branch
 
02:07:49.870 --> 02:07:49.880 align:start position:0%
Direction on the energy policy and uh is
 
02:07:51.750 --> 02:07:51.760 align:start position:0%
used as a resource for legislator and
 
02:07:55.910 --> 02:07:55.920 align:start position:0%
others in in determining um you know uh
 
02:07:58.510 --> 02:07:58.520 align:start position:0%
the direction on legislation or uh you
 
02:08:01.229 --> 02:08:01.239 align:start position:0%
know regulatory proceedings um so that
 
02:08:03.030 --> 02:08:03.040 align:start position:0%
that would be impactful there and I will
 
02:08:05.750 --> 02:08:05.760 align:start position:0%
note that we currently have open a
 
02:08:08.430 --> 02:08:08.440 align:start position:0%
comment period uh for the the next
 
02:08:11.109 --> 02:08:11.119 align:start position:0%
update of the 10-year strategy uh we I
 
02:08:13.990 --> 02:08:14.000 align:start position:0%
don't think have had any comments as as
 
02:08:16.030 --> 02:08:16.040 align:start position:0%
of yet so we're we're looking forward to
 
02:08:18.270 --> 02:08:18.280 align:start position:0%
those and then obviously uh per the
 
02:08:20.990 --> 02:08:21.000 align:start position:0%
statute we will we will be uh asking the
 
02:08:23.790 --> 02:08:23.800 align:start position:0%
chairman to uh invite us to to uh meet
 
02:08:25.669 --> 02:08:25.679 align:start position:0%
with this committee as as is required by
 
02:08:28.030 --> 02:08:28.040 align:start position:0%
law uh on the 10year state energy
 
02:08:30.790 --> 02:08:30.800 align:start position:0%
strategy so this bill's policy statement
 
02:08:35.109 --> 02:08:35.119 align:start position:0%
certainly is a more clear uh Direction
 
02:08:39.549 --> 02:08:39.559 align:start position:0%
than what we have under current 378 37
 
02:08:41.189 --> 02:08:41.199 align:start position:0%
uh the current policy statement is
 
02:08:43.069 --> 02:08:43.079 align:start position:0%
pretty broad as you've heard it's it's
 
02:08:46.030 --> 02:08:46.040 align:start position:0%
it's mostly a list of uh of good things
 
02:08:47.629 --> 02:08:47.639 align:start position:0%
and and it's a direction that we should
 
02:08:49.709 --> 02:08:49.719 align:start position:0%
sort of balance all these all these uh
 
02:08:51.750 --> 02:08:51.760 align:start position:0%
considerations and that's that's great
 
02:08:54.189 --> 02:08:54.199 align:start position:0%
right uh but it isn't all that helpful
 
02:08:56.270 --> 02:08:56.280 align:start position:0%
in determining a direction because it's
 
02:08:58.870 --> 02:08:58.880 align:start position:0%
essentially just saying do good things
 
02:09:01.270 --> 02:09:01.280 align:start position:0%
and don't do bad things and uh I think
 
02:09:04.270 --> 02:09:04.280 align:start position:0%
that this bill um certainly does give us
 
02:09:06.270 --> 02:09:06.280 align:start position:0%
a more Clear Vision and a statement of
 
02:09:08.030 --> 02:09:08.040 align:start position:0%
emphasis on reliability and
 
02:09:10.950 --> 02:09:10.960 align:start position:0%
affordability as the prime sponsor uh
 
02:09:12.990 --> 02:09:13.000 align:start position:0%
mentioned uh it emphasizes Market
 
02:09:14.870 --> 02:09:14.880 align:start position:0%
principles it's focused on markets and
 
02:09:16.870 --> 02:09:16.880 align:start position:0%
not government driving resource
 
02:09:18.750 --> 02:09:18.760 align:start position:0%
selection and limiting subsidization
 
02:09:22.069 --> 02:09:22.079 align:start position:0%
only to what's necessary um
 
02:09:23.390 --> 02:09:23.400 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm happy to take questions you
 
02:09:24.990 --> 02:09:25.000 align:start position:0%
you've heard the whole the whole thing I
 
02:09:27.750 --> 02:09:27.760 align:start position:0%
will say I guess up front uh there's
 
02:09:30.790 --> 02:09:30.800 align:start position:0%
been a lot of discussion on technology
 
02:09:33.149 --> 02:09:33.159 align:start position:0%
neutrality and and sort of an all of the
 
02:09:34.669 --> 02:09:34.679 align:start position:0%
above strategy and and I had mentioned
 
02:09:36.069 --> 02:09:36.079 align:start position:0%
it in the intro presentation that we
 
02:09:38.189 --> 02:09:38.199 align:start position:0%
gave a couple of weeks ago but I will
 
02:09:40.109 --> 02:09:40.119 align:start position:0%
mention here that technology neutral
 
02:09:42.669 --> 02:09:42.679 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean you can't have goals right
 
02:09:44.950 --> 02:09:44.960 align:start position:0%
having a goal of reliability of
 
02:09:46.510 --> 02:09:46.520 align:start position:0%
affordability of Environmental
 
02:09:48.350 --> 02:09:48.360 align:start position:0%
Protection whatever it might be those
 
02:09:50.510 --> 02:09:50.520 align:start position:0%
are perfectly with reasonable in a
 
02:09:51.990 --> 02:09:52.000 align:start position:0%
technology neutral State and in fact
 
02:09:54.310 --> 02:09:54.320 align:start position:0%
they're they're encouraged what what you
 
02:09:56.189 --> 02:09:56.199 align:start position:0%
want with technology neutrality is to be
 
02:09:58.229 --> 02:09:58.239 align:start position:0%
goal oriented so we say what do we want
 
02:10:01.069 --> 02:10:01.079 align:start position:0%
the outcome to be and then from there we
 
02:10:02.990 --> 02:10:03.000 align:start position:0%
we can select the resources that will
 
02:10:05.229 --> 02:10:05.239 align:start position:0%
help us meet that what technology
 
02:10:06.390 --> 02:10:06.400 align:start position:0%
neutral means is we're not going to
 
02:10:08.350 --> 02:10:08.360 align:start position:0%
Advantage a particular technology or
 
02:10:10.589 --> 02:10:10.599 align:start position:0%
disadvantage of particular technology
 
02:10:13.669 --> 02:10:13.679 align:start position:0%
simply by virtue of it being that
 
02:10:15.589 --> 02:10:15.599 align:start position:0%
technology right we we want to know what
 
02:10:17.589 --> 02:10:17.599 align:start position:0%
we want to do and then and you know
 
02:10:19.750 --> 02:10:19.760 align:start position:0%
build the system to uh meet it so happy
 
02:10:22.549 --> 02:10:22.559 align:start position:0%
to take questions
 
02:10:26.310 --> 02:10:26.320 align:start position:0%
okay uh questions for commissioner Elms
 
02:10:26.320 --> 02:10:27.950 align:start position:0%
okay uh questions for commissioner Elms
representative

02:10:27.950 --> 02:10:27.960 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:10:30.990 --> 02:10:31.000 align:start position:0%
kapan I'll defer to represent McGee as
 
02:10:32.709 --> 02:10:32.719 align:start position:0%
as my ranking member representative
 
02:10:35.310 --> 02:10:35.320 align:start position:0%
McGee thank you that's very kind of you
 
02:10:37.589 --> 02:10:37.599 align:start position:0%
to see again hand first sorry good to
 
02:10:40.990 --> 02:10:41.000 align:start position:0%
good to see you again uh Mr Elms so uh
 
02:10:43.030 --> 02:10:43.040 align:start position:0%
or Deputy Commissioner Elms right that
 
02:10:49.069 --> 02:10:49.079 align:start position:0%
correct um You referred to 374 f8 as a
 
02:10:52.470 --> 02:10:52.480 align:start position:0%
location where you're required to to um
 
02:10:54.790 --> 02:10:54.800 align:start position:0%
protect the interests of the state in
 
02:10:57.750 --> 02:10:57.760 align:start position:0%
the region uh and any Regional policies
 
02:11:00.790 --> 02:11:00.800 align:start position:0%
that affect us internally would that not
 
02:11:02.870 --> 02:11:02.880 align:start position:0%
already give you jurisdiction if there
 
02:11:04.430 --> 02:11:04.440 align:start position:0%
was something on the regional grid that
 
02:11:06.270 --> 02:11:06.280 align:start position:0%
was located within the state this
 
02:11:09.189 --> 02:11:09.199 align:start position:0%
conversation's come up already um if
 
02:11:11.870 --> 02:11:11.880 align:start position:0%
there were a power plant that
 
02:11:15.629 --> 02:11:15.639 align:start position:0%
were uh affected that you wanted to
 
02:11:18.830 --> 02:11:18.840 align:start position:0%
discuss in terms of reliability for the
 
02:11:20.629 --> 02:11:20.639 align:start position:0%
state even though it's a regional grid
 
02:11:22.030 --> 02:11:22.040 align:start position:0%
wouldn't you
 
02:11:25.510 --> 02:11:25.520 align:start position:0%
already have the authority to go to um
 
02:11:28.189 --> 02:11:28.199 align:start position:0%
you know the iso New England and discuss
 
02:11:31.149 --> 02:11:31.159 align:start position:0%
with them any plans for retirement or
 
02:11:32.790 --> 02:11:32.800 align:start position:0%
conversion or that sort of thing it it
 
02:11:34.830 --> 02:11:34.840 align:start position:0%
just doesn't seem like this bill really
 
02:11:37.990 --> 02:11:38.000 align:start position:0%
has that much purpose except to
 
02:11:40.709 --> 02:11:40.719 align:start position:0%
overwrite what you know the statute that
 
02:11:43.310 --> 02:11:43.320 align:start position:0%
exists which I think many of us feel has
 
02:11:45.109 --> 02:11:45.119 align:start position:0%
been helping us have better policies
 
02:11:46.990 --> 02:11:47.000 align:start position:0%
because it is all inclusive in terms of
 
02:11:48.910 --> 02:11:48.920 align:start position:0%
the the things that it includes right
 
02:11:50.629 --> 02:11:50.639 align:start position:0%
now yeah Don thank you for the question
 
02:11:52.470 --> 02:11:52.480 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I have a four-month-old at at
 
02:11:54.149 --> 02:11:54.159 align:start position:0%
home so I might just be I'm not sleeping
 
02:11:57.629 --> 02:11:57.639 align:start position:0%
great so uh uh what what I would say is
 
02:11:58.870 --> 02:11:58.880 align:start position:0%
is that question sort of directed to
 
02:12:01.549 --> 02:12:01.559 align:start position:0%
sections two and three and sort of that
 
02:12:01.559 --> 02:12:03.390 align:start position:0%
sections two and three and sort of that
responsibility

02:12:03.390 --> 02:12:03.400 align:start position:0%
responsibility
 
02:12:07.229 --> 02:12:07.239 align:start position:0%
to uh you know uh okay yeah it's
 
02:12:09.549 --> 02:12:09.559 align:start position:0%
existing law you know I guess from from
 
02:12:11.149 --> 02:12:11.159 align:start position:0%
our perspective if if this bill
 
02:12:13.510 --> 02:12:13.520 align:start position:0%
contemplates striking that law we'd be
 
02:12:16.589 --> 02:12:16.599 align:start position:0%
happy to provide more comments um that's
 
02:12:19.350 --> 02:12:19.360 align:start position:0%
in effect it hasn't been used that that
 
02:12:21.270 --> 02:12:21.280 align:start position:0%
uh ability we haven't heard from a power
 
02:12:22.589 --> 02:12:22.599 align:start position:0%
plant if it were to happen we would
 
02:12:24.950 --> 02:12:24.960 align:start position:0%
obviously follow the statute and work
 
02:12:27.310 --> 02:12:27.320 align:start position:0%
with the doj to determine what if any
 
02:12:30.030 --> 02:12:30.040 align:start position:0%
actions we would take um I I think you
 
02:12:31.510 --> 02:12:31.520 align:start position:0%
know the doj and certainly the
 
02:12:33.870 --> 02:12:33.880 align:start position:0%
department of energy uh do have
 
02:12:35.669 --> 02:12:35.679 align:start position:0%
capabilities with this law and without
 
02:12:37.990 --> 02:12:38.000 align:start position:0%
this law to Advocate on behalf of New
 
02:12:41.030 --> 02:12:41.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's policy and interests in the
 
02:12:42.669 --> 02:12:42.679 align:start position:0%
federal and Regional
 
02:12:45.709 --> 02:12:45.719 align:start position:0%
levels follow up so the followup would
 
02:12:47.750 --> 02:12:47.760 align:start position:0%
be then you had mentioned that you
 
02:12:49.910 --> 02:12:49.920 align:start position:0%
thought that this version of the New
 
02:12:51.830 --> 02:12:51.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire energy policy
 
02:12:54.189 --> 02:12:54.199 align:start position:0%
was more specific and easier better
 
02:12:56.589 --> 02:12:56.599 align:start position:0%
defined and easier to follow so I'd like
 
02:12:58.669 --> 02:12:58.679 align:start position:0%
to know what you think particularly is
 
02:13:00.830 --> 02:13:00.840 align:start position:0%
better about this gotcha no no that
 
02:13:02.189 --> 02:13:02.199 align:start position:0%
that's a that's a good question too and
 
02:13:04.950 --> 02:13:04.960 align:start position:0%
so on on that realm it's more um when we
 
02:13:08.030 --> 02:13:08.040 align:start position:0%
look at our discussions in at Nesco um
 
02:13:09.189 --> 02:13:09.199 align:start position:0%
the New England states committee on
 
02:13:11.549 --> 02:13:11.559 align:start position:0%
electricity and that's where we uh get
 
02:13:13.750 --> 02:13:13.760 align:start position:0%
together with the states to figure out
 
02:13:15.390 --> 02:13:15.400 align:start position:0%
recommendations that we're going to make
 
02:13:17.430 --> 02:13:17.440 align:start position:0%
as the states to ISO New England and the
 
02:13:20.549 --> 02:13:20.559 align:start position:0%
broad group of stakeholders um you know
 
02:13:22.470 --> 02:13:22.480 align:start position:0%
a lot of times those conversations are
 
02:13:24.350 --> 02:13:24.360 align:start position:0%
centered on things like Market design
 
02:13:27.069 --> 02:13:27.079 align:start position:0%
for how we procure wholesale energy and
 
02:13:30.350 --> 02:13:30.360 align:start position:0%
uh you know a lot of those uh Market
 
02:13:32.950 --> 02:13:32.960 align:start position:0%
design questions are pretty complex and
 
02:13:36.270 --> 02:13:36.280 align:start position:0%
they're involve uh the balancing of the
 
02:13:38.350 --> 02:13:38.360 align:start position:0%
variety of States policy goals and so in
 
02:13:38.360 --> 02:13:39.229 align:start position:0%
variety of States policy goals and so in
those

02:13:39.229 --> 02:13:39.239 align:start position:0%
those
 
02:13:42.390 --> 02:13:42.400 align:start position:0%
conversations um you know New Hampshire
 
02:13:44.310 --> 02:13:44.320 align:start position:0%
we we take the line that we want to
 
02:13:46.390 --> 02:13:46.400 align:start position:0%
promote New Hampshire's policies so to
 
02:13:49.270 --> 02:13:49.280 align:start position:0%
the extent that those policies direct us
 
02:13:51.669 --> 02:13:51.679 align:start position:0%
that our preference is for
 
02:13:53.830 --> 02:13:53.840 align:start position:0%
um you know Market selection of
 
02:13:55.910 --> 02:13:55.920 align:start position:0%
resources as opposed to you know power
 
02:13:57.709 --> 02:13:57.719 align:start position:0%
purchase agreements as opposed to other
 
02:13:59.629 --> 02:13:59.639 align:start position:0%
sort of out of Market actions to the
 
02:14:03.109 --> 02:14:03.119 align:start position:0%
extent that uh our state policy directs
 
02:14:05.990 --> 02:14:06.000 align:start position:0%
us to be fuel neutral when it comes to
 
02:14:08.549 --> 02:14:08.559 align:start position:0%
Resource selection uh all those things
 
02:14:11.030 --> 02:14:11.040 align:start position:0%
will come into play in our discussions
 
02:14:12.589 --> 02:14:12.599 align:start position:0%
with with other folks because if this
 
02:14:14.470 --> 02:14:14.480 align:start position:0%
state energy policy rewrite was to say
 
02:14:17.030 --> 02:14:17.040 align:start position:0%
simply you know we want to focus on
 
02:14:20.030 --> 02:14:20.040 align:start position:0%
decarbonization uh as as New Hampshire
 
02:14:21.750 --> 02:14:21.760 align:start position:0%
priority in there
 
02:14:22.990 --> 02:14:23.000 align:start position:0%
uh we're going to take a very different
 
02:14:24.990 --> 02:14:25.000 align:start position:0%
position than we would if the if the
 
02:14:27.629 --> 02:14:27.639 align:start position:0%
preference is for affordability or
 
02:14:30.709 --> 02:14:30.719 align:start position:0%
reliability um and and so you know in
 
02:14:32.910 --> 02:14:32.920 align:start position:0%
those discussions that's where a
 
02:14:35.430 --> 02:14:35.440 align:start position:0%
statement uh comes into play again
 
02:14:38.030 --> 02:14:38.040 align:start position:0%
neutral whether or not this statement is
 
02:14:40.149 --> 02:14:40.159 align:start position:0%
is the pref the preference that's up to
 
02:14:42.990 --> 02:14:43.000 align:start position:0%
the legislature to determine uh I'm just
 
02:14:45.470 --> 02:14:45.480 align:start position:0%
trying to let you know how we will take
 
02:14:48.030 --> 02:14:48.040 align:start position:0%
what you do and use that uh in in the
 
02:14:51.589 --> 02:14:51.599 align:start position:0%
furtherance of our mission
 
02:14:54.390 --> 02:14:54.400 align:start position:0%
representative Kaplan thank you Mr chair
 
02:14:55.830 --> 02:14:55.840 align:start position:0%
and thank you commissioner Elms for
 
02:14:59.350 --> 02:14:59.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:02.709 --> 02:15:02.719 align:start position:0%
um I forgot I was gonna say
 
02:15:05.750 --> 02:15:05.760 align:start position:0%
um oh yeah okay um can we go to
 
02:15:07.390 --> 02:15:07.400 align:start position:0%
representative Bry while no I've got the
 
02:15:10.669 --> 02:15:10.679 align:start position:0%
question uh regarding the the first
 
02:15:13.149 --> 02:15:13.159 align:start position:0%
section of the bill and and the uh the
 
02:15:19.350 --> 02:15:19.360 align:start position:0%
uh the emphasis on on reliable and firm
 
02:15:21.910 --> 02:15:21.920 align:start position:0%
um it seems to be premised on the idea
 
02:15:24.910 --> 02:15:24.920 align:start position:0%
that that the regional uh Market actors
 
02:15:27.189 --> 02:15:27.199 align:start position:0%
are acting irresponsibly or heading in
 
02:15:29.589 --> 02:15:29.599 align:start position:0%
some sort of Reckless Direction so
 
02:15:31.270 --> 02:15:31.280 align:start position:0%
what's your sense as somebody as as you
 
02:15:33.910 --> 02:15:33.920 align:start position:0%
just mentioned interacting at that level
 
02:15:37.189 --> 02:15:37.199 align:start position:0%
is are the regional you know actors ISO
 
02:15:39.950 --> 02:15:39.960 align:start position:0%
New England the um the other people uh
 
02:15:42.390 --> 02:15:42.400 align:start position:0%
are they taking care of are they
 
02:15:45.069 --> 02:15:45.079 align:start position:0%
cognizant of of these concerns and are
 
02:15:48.830 --> 02:15:48.840 align:start position:0%
are those concerns being h heard it's a
 
02:15:50.750 --> 02:15:50.760 align:start position:0%
good question thank you for it um you
 
02:15:53.270 --> 02:15:53.280 align:start position:0%
know I'm not sure I'm I'm quite at the
 
02:15:54.589 --> 02:15:54.599 align:start position:0%
place where I could use the word
 
02:15:57.549 --> 02:15:57.559 align:start position:0%
reckless but uh no obviously there are
 
02:16:00.030 --> 02:16:00.040 align:start position:0%
real concerns they've been raised as as
 
02:16:02.750 --> 02:16:02.760 align:start position:0%
uh I think representative o raised uh
 
02:16:05.549 --> 02:16:05.559 align:start position:0%
from nerk uh and and ISO New England as
 
02:16:08.310 --> 02:16:08.320 align:start position:0%
we talked about in their epet report uh
 
02:16:10.910 --> 02:16:10.920 align:start position:0%
in our intro presentation that's the uh
 
02:16:12.430 --> 02:16:12.440 align:start position:0%
uh report where they talked about sort
 
02:16:13.709 --> 02:16:13.719 align:start position:0%
of what would be needed to meet the
 
02:16:16.189 --> 02:16:16.199 align:start position:0%
decarbonization goals of New England by
 
02:16:18.709 --> 02:16:18.719 align:start position:0%
2050 and obviously there's going to be a
 
02:16:20.310 --> 02:16:20.320 align:start position:0%
lot of infrastructure needed if we're
 
02:16:23.589 --> 02:16:23.599 align:start position:0%
going to meet the goals um of New
 
02:16:26.030 --> 02:16:26.040 align:start position:0%
England while maintaining the policy
 
02:16:29.430 --> 02:16:29.440 align:start position:0%
directions that the various states have
 
02:16:32.030 --> 02:16:32.040 align:start position:0%
um you know from from from our
 
02:16:34.389 --> 02:16:34.399 align:start position:0%
perspective there are real reliability
 
02:16:36.190 --> 02:16:36.200 align:start position:0%
challenges uh we're spending a lot of
 
02:16:38.030 --> 02:16:38.040 align:start position:0%
time working on them uh we're spending a
 
02:16:39.790 --> 02:16:39.800 align:start position:0%
lot of discussion on them but there are
 
02:16:43.429 --> 02:16:43.439 align:start position:0%
some real uh difficulties in imagining
 
02:16:45.589 --> 02:16:45.599 align:start position:0%
how we are going to maintain the system
 
02:16:47.750 --> 02:16:47.760 align:start position:0%
we have with the electrification goals
 
02:16:51.709 --> 02:16:51.719 align:start position:0%
that folks have without some type of
 
02:16:54.070 --> 02:16:54.080 align:start position:0%
large scale infrastructure infusion
 
02:16:56.549 --> 02:16:56.559 align:start position:0%
somewhere whether it's in a particular
 
02:16:59.790 --> 02:16:59.800 align:start position:0%
resource um or in in other
 
02:17:02.030 --> 02:17:02.040 align:start position:0%
infrastructure or or or simply just you
 
02:17:04.709 --> 02:17:04.719 align:start position:0%
know Finding ways to insulate ourselves
 
02:17:06.629 --> 02:17:06.639 align:start position:0%
from the from those goals if we don't
 
02:17:07.870 --> 02:17:07.880 align:start position:0%
think it's going to be possible and I
 
02:17:09.950 --> 02:17:09.960 align:start position:0%
know there's other legislation to look
 
02:17:09.960 --> 02:17:12.669 align:start position:0%
know there's other legislation to look
at

02:17:12.669 --> 02:17:12.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:16.750 --> 02:17:16.760 align:start position:0%
that followup follow yeah so I'm just
 
02:17:19.309 --> 02:17:19.319 align:start position:0%
curious about the word insulate and and
 
02:17:20.589 --> 02:17:20.599 align:start position:0%
because that's kind of echoed in this
 
02:17:20.599 --> 02:17:21.349 align:start position:0%
because that's kind of echoed in this
bill

02:17:21.349 --> 02:17:21.359 align:start position:0%
bill
 
02:17:23.669 --> 02:17:23.679 align:start position:0%
what would those measures entail to
 
02:17:26.349 --> 02:17:26.359 align:start position:0%
insulate ourselves from the
 
02:17:28.469 --> 02:17:28.479 align:start position:0%
regional well I believe representative
 
02:17:30.669 --> 02:17:30.679 align:start position:0%
Summers has introduced a bill that would
 
02:17:32.870 --> 02:17:32.880 align:start position:0%
uh instruct the department of energy to
 
02:17:35.110 --> 02:17:35.120 align:start position:0%
investigate what that could look like uh
 
02:17:38.270 --> 02:17:38.280 align:start position:0%
whether it's looking at uh completely
 
02:17:40.910 --> 02:17:40.920 align:start position:0%
leaving ISO New England's grid as a
 
02:17:44.030 --> 02:17:44.040 align:start position:0%
state or to explore other regulatory or
 
02:17:46.990 --> 02:17:47.000 align:start position:0%
policy decisions that would would uh you
 
02:17:49.870 --> 02:17:49.880 align:start position:0%
know examine whether or not our
 
02:17:52.709 --> 02:17:52.719 align:start position:0%
participation in ISO Regional markets is
 
02:17:54.070 --> 02:17:54.080 align:start position:0%
uh in the best interests of New
 
02:17:55.349 --> 02:17:55.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so there there are a variety
 
02:17:56.950 --> 02:17:56.960 align:start position:0%
of things I could look at I'm certainly
 
02:17:58.830 --> 02:17:58.840 align:start position:0%
not ready to tell you all of them and
 
02:18:00.030 --> 02:18:00.040 align:start position:0%
and that's actually something that we
 
02:18:01.790 --> 02:18:01.800 align:start position:0%
would be instructed to look into and to
 
02:18:03.830 --> 02:18:03.840 align:start position:0%
provide reports back uh to this
 
02:18:05.750 --> 02:18:05.760 align:start position:0%
committee and to the legislature broadly
 
02:18:08.349 --> 02:18:08.359 align:start position:0%
uh should other legislation move forward
 
02:18:10.830 --> 02:18:10.840 align:start position:0%
representative bne has a question thank
 
02:18:12.429 --> 02:18:12.439 align:start position:0%
you chairman and thank you uh
 
02:18:14.429 --> 02:18:14.439 align:start position:0%
commissioner els for um
 
02:18:16.589 --> 02:18:16.599 align:start position:0%
testifying um so there's been a lot of
 
02:18:18.870 --> 02:18:18.880 align:start position:0%
questions and answers implying that this
 
02:18:22.790 --> 02:18:22.800 align:start position:0%
bill strongly favors fossil fuels um but
 
02:18:26.870 --> 02:18:26.880 align:start position:0%
uh lines uh 10 through 12 talk about um
 
02:18:28.629 --> 02:18:28.639 align:start position:0%
the state's energy Independence and I
 
02:18:30.469 --> 02:18:30.479 align:start position:0%
was wondering how does the department of
 
02:18:33.709 --> 02:18:33.719 align:start position:0%
energy interpret ensuring the state's
 
02:18:35.589 --> 02:18:35.599 align:start position:0%
energy Independence and then later in
 
02:18:38.429 --> 02:18:38.439 align:start position:0%
the same sentence uh it talks about
 
02:18:41.910 --> 02:18:41.920 align:start position:0%
secure energy resources does does secure
 
02:18:44.910 --> 02:18:44.920 align:start position:0%
energy resources and energy Independence
 
02:18:47.589 --> 02:18:47.599 align:start position:0%
exclude fossil fuels includes them or
 
02:18:50.950 --> 02:18:50.960 align:start position:0%
how does that um compare with locally
 
02:18:53.549 --> 02:18:53.559 align:start position:0%
produce resources I guess that's a
 
02:18:54.629 --> 02:18:54.639 align:start position:0%
that's a very good question
 
02:18:55.950 --> 02:18:55.960 align:start position:0%
representative thank you very much for
 
02:18:57.750 --> 02:18:57.760 align:start position:0%
it and I was uh saying to my colleague
 
02:18:59.790 --> 02:18:59.800 align:start position:0%
before I came up that uh I know there
 
02:19:01.750 --> 02:19:01.760 align:start position:0%
was a lot of talk about fossil fuels in
 
02:19:03.429 --> 02:19:03.439 align:start position:0%
the bill I couldn't find the reference
 
02:19:05.870 --> 02:19:05.880 align:start position:0%
to it and maybe it was just sort of the
 
02:19:07.990 --> 02:19:08.000 align:start position:0%
unanimous agreement that that fossil
 
02:19:10.549 --> 02:19:10.559 align:start position:0%
fuels you know fall into that sort of
 
02:19:13.389 --> 02:19:13.399 align:start position:0%
more reliable uh and affordable energy
 
02:19:15.190 --> 02:19:15.200 align:start position:0%
source you know that certainly wasn't my
 
02:19:17.309 --> 02:19:17.319 align:start position:0%
reading up front uh you know as we said
 
02:19:19.790 --> 02:19:19.800 align:start position:0%
we viewed it to be goal oriented and so
 
02:19:21.629 --> 02:19:21.639 align:start position:0%
if fossil fuels are the
 
02:19:24.509 --> 02:19:24.519 align:start position:0%
best means of achieving our goals great
 
02:19:26.669 --> 02:19:26.679 align:start position:0%
if solar and storage is the best means
 
02:19:28.230 --> 02:19:28.240 align:start position:0%
of doing it that's great we want to make
 
02:19:30.309 --> 02:19:30.319 align:start position:0%
sure we we meet the goals with whatever
 
02:19:32.629 --> 02:19:32.639 align:start position:0%
we can as efficiently as cheaply and as
 
02:19:37.830 --> 02:19:37.840 align:start position:0%
uh you know uh stably as possible um you
 
02:19:39.349 --> 02:19:39.359 align:start position:0%
know to to the question about energy
 
02:19:40.950 --> 02:19:40.960 align:start position:0%
Independence I think it's a good one and
 
02:19:43.509 --> 02:19:43.519 align:start position:0%
one where you could uh certainly read
 
02:19:45.349 --> 02:19:45.359 align:start position:0%
different parts of it and and I think
 
02:19:46.830 --> 02:19:46.840 align:start position:0%
you know maybe maybe Clarity might be
 
02:19:49.469 --> 02:19:49.479 align:start position:0%
helpful there um and we've you know uh
 
02:19:51.230 --> 02:19:51.240 align:start position:0%
looked at that
 
02:19:53.270 --> 02:19:53.280 align:start position:0%
I think to me looking at energy
 
02:19:55.110 --> 02:19:55.120 align:start position:0%
Independence in the context of State
 
02:19:57.630 --> 02:19:57.640 align:start position:0%
energy policy uh as I talked about
 
02:20:00.429 --> 02:20:00.439 align:start position:0%
before um looking at sort of insulating
 
02:20:02.710 --> 02:20:02.720 align:start position:0%
ourselves from the policy decisions of
 
02:20:04.550 --> 02:20:04.560 align:start position:0%
folks at the regional and federal level
 
02:20:06.510 --> 02:20:06.520 align:start position:0%
it was what I looked at there you could
 
02:20:09.309 --> 02:20:09.319 align:start position:0%
read into it other directions and I
 
02:20:11.830 --> 02:20:11.840 align:start position:0%
think that would be perhaps helpful
 
02:20:15.309 --> 02:20:15.319 align:start position:0%
Clarity um uh should this bill you know
 
02:20:15.319 --> 02:20:18.750 align:start position:0%
Clarity um uh should this bill you know
move

02:20:18.750 --> 02:20:18.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:22.030 --> 02:20:22.040 align:start position:0%
forward follow up um and then the the
 
02:20:24.150 --> 02:20:24.160 align:start position:0%
second uh question was about secure
 
02:20:26.630 --> 02:20:26.640 align:start position:0%
energy resources how do you interpret
 
02:20:30.030 --> 02:20:30.040 align:start position:0%
secure in that in that uh line it's the
 
02:20:32.309 --> 02:20:32.319 align:start position:0%
it's the same line uh sentence but the
 
02:20:35.830 --> 02:20:35.840 align:start position:0%
last last uh two three
 
02:20:37.990 --> 02:20:38.000 align:start position:0%
words yeah so uh you know there there
 
02:20:40.270 --> 02:20:40.280 align:start position:0%
are a whole uh number of ways that you
 
02:20:42.429 --> 02:20:42.439 align:start position:0%
could interpret secure resources you can
 
02:20:44.429 --> 02:20:44.439 align:start position:0%
look at supply chain security when you
 
02:20:46.429 --> 02:20:46.439 align:start position:0%
look at something like you know our
 
02:20:48.750 --> 02:20:48.760 align:start position:0%
natural gas infrastructure is ryant on
 
02:20:51.230 --> 02:20:51.240 align:start position:0%
for the most part on Pipeline capacity
 
02:20:53.230 --> 02:20:53.240 align:start position:0%
so you know to the extent that that that
 
02:20:55.349 --> 02:20:55.359 align:start position:0%
gets eaten up and that we have a a
 
02:20:57.830 --> 02:20:57.840 align:start position:0%
lacking in in appropriate pipeline
 
02:21:00.230 --> 02:21:00.240 align:start position:0%
capacity that that's a security concern
 
02:21:03.110 --> 02:21:03.120 align:start position:0%
there's also obviously supply chain uh
 
02:21:06.870 --> 02:21:06.880 align:start position:0%
in relation to other resources um and
 
02:21:08.469 --> 02:21:08.479 align:start position:0%
then obviously cyber security is
 
02:21:10.389 --> 02:21:10.399 align:start position:0%
something that could could play a role
 
02:21:12.550 --> 02:21:12.560 align:start position:0%
there ensuring that we have a resilient
 
02:21:15.030 --> 02:21:15.040 align:start position:0%
grid uh you know in a in a place that
 
02:21:16.750 --> 02:21:16.760 align:start position:0%
obviously has a lot of weather effects
 
02:21:18.389 --> 02:21:18.399 align:start position:0%
so you know you could read into a number
 
02:21:20.230 --> 02:21:20.240 align:start position:0%
of things I think you know all of it
 
02:21:22.429 --> 02:21:22.439 align:start position:0%
comes back to the idea of reliability
 
02:21:23.990 --> 02:21:24.000 align:start position:0%
again if you're being goal oriented
 
02:21:26.790 --> 02:21:26.800 align:start position:0%
right customers want to be able to flip
 
02:21:29.150 --> 02:21:29.160 align:start position:0%
the switch and turn the lights on and so
 
02:21:31.670 --> 02:21:31.680 align:start position:0%
building out from that is how you can
 
02:21:34.590 --> 02:21:34.600 align:start position:0%
look at reliability to make sure okay is
 
02:21:36.790 --> 02:21:36.800 align:start position:0%
what we're doing ensuring the
 
02:21:38.750 --> 02:21:38.760 align:start position:0%
functioning of the grid and and
 
02:21:41.150 --> 02:21:41.160 align:start position:0%
maintaining uh you know our ability to
 
02:21:45.349 --> 02:21:45.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:48.590 --> 02:21:48.600 align:start position:0%
customers representative Swanson has a
 
02:21:51.309 --> 02:21:51.319 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair thank you
 
02:21:53.590 --> 02:21:53.600 align:start position:0%
commissioner Elms
 
02:21:56.389 --> 02:21:56.399 align:start position:0%
uh before I retired a couple years ago I
 
02:21:59.030 --> 02:21:59.040 align:start position:0%
was a group leader for Global navigation
 
02:22:00.510 --> 02:22:00.520 align:start position:0%
satellite system
 
02:22:03.230 --> 02:22:03.240 align:start position:0%
modernization and it was critical for us
 
02:22:05.870 --> 02:22:05.880 align:start position:0%
to have measures remember we need to ask
 
02:22:08.510 --> 02:22:08.520 align:start position:0%
a question reliability and
 
02:22:11.469 --> 02:22:11.479 align:start position:0%
availability and those measures had
 
02:22:15.030 --> 02:22:15.040 align:start position:0%
formulas and thresholds you mentioned a
 
02:22:18.110 --> 02:22:18.120 align:start position:0%
uh 10-year energy strategy uh there's no
 
02:22:20.710 --> 02:22:20.720 align:start position:0%
formula or thresholds in this bill but
 
02:22:23.790 --> 02:22:23.800 align:start position:0%
in your 10 10e energy strategy do you
 
02:22:25.670 --> 02:22:25.680 align:start position:0%
have formulas or thresholds for
 
02:22:27.150 --> 02:22:27.160 align:start position:0%
reliability and
 
02:22:29.190 --> 02:22:29.200 align:start position:0%
availability uh there there certainly
 
02:22:31.389 --> 02:22:31.399 align:start position:0%
are reliability standards that are
 
02:22:32.870 --> 02:22:32.880 align:start position:0%
placed and a lot of the times that's at
 
02:22:34.950 --> 02:22:34.960 align:start position:0%
the sort of the iso New England uh level
 
02:22:37.349 --> 02:22:37.359 align:start position:0%
and that's you a lot of times based on
 
02:22:40.030 --> 02:22:40.040 align:start position:0%
expectations for outages or load
 
02:22:41.429 --> 02:22:41.439 align:start position:0%
shedding and and and you know the
 
02:22:44.230 --> 02:22:44.240 align:start position:0%
ability to say we are going to maintain
 
02:22:46.990 --> 02:22:47.000 align:start position:0%
service with the exception of one one
 
02:22:48.830 --> 02:22:48.840 align:start position:0%
day every 10 years or whatever the
 
02:22:50.630 --> 02:22:50.640 align:start position:0%
standard uh is so there are standards
 
02:22:52.270 --> 02:22:52.280 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm sorry I don't have them off the
 
02:22:54.630 --> 02:22:54.640 align:start position:0%
top of my head and I can certainly uh
 
02:22:56.030 --> 02:22:56.040 align:start position:0%
you know follow up with the committee
 
02:22:57.950 --> 02:22:57.960 align:start position:0%
and talk about some of those reliability
 
02:22:59.550 --> 02:22:59.560 align:start position:0%
standards that exist thank you
 
02:23:02.190 --> 02:23:02.200 align:start position:0%
commissioner Els thank you Mr chair
 
02:23:05.870 --> 02:23:05.880 align:start position:0%
thank you representative M thank you for
 
02:23:08.750 --> 02:23:08.760 align:start position:0%
indulging me and you as well um I just
 
02:23:11.429 --> 02:23:11.439 align:start position:0%
had the a question you mentioned that
 
02:23:14.230 --> 02:23:14.240 align:start position:0%
the 10year energy strategy report had o
 
02:23:16.950 --> 02:23:16.960 align:start position:0%
Open time for public comment can you
 
02:23:20.710 --> 02:23:20.720 align:start position:0%
just tell us when that's done because I
 
02:23:23.469 --> 02:23:23.479 align:start position:0%
would like to comment if I
 
02:23:25.990 --> 02:23:26.000 align:start position:0%
could uh we think the end of March uh
 
02:23:27.710 --> 02:23:27.720 align:start position:0%
it's on our website and we can happily
 
02:23:29.030 --> 02:23:29.040 align:start position:0%
follow up with the committee to give you
 
02:23:31.030 --> 02:23:31.040 align:start position:0%
that timeline and we'll we'll intend to
 
02:23:33.269 --> 02:23:33.279 align:start position:0%
keep pushing that out uh so that folks
 
02:23:34.750 --> 02:23:34.760 align:start position:0%
can have their voices
 
02:23:38.830 --> 02:23:38.840 align:start position:0%
heard okay great so let's oh come
 
02:23:41.910 --> 02:23:41.920 align:start position:0%
on representative
 
02:23:44.990 --> 02:23:45.000 align:start position:0%
Corman okay he waves off so we're done
 
02:23:47.550 --> 02:23:47.560 align:start position:0%
on this house bill uh so I'm going to
 
02:23:49.309 --> 02:23:49.319 align:start position:0%
close the public hearing on House Bill
 
02:23:49.319 --> 02:23:51.070 align:start position:0%
close the public hearing on House Bill
504

02:23:51.070 --> 02:23:51.080 align:start position:0%
504
 
02:23:52.870 --> 02:23:52.880 align:start position:0%
because we need to open a public hearing
 
02:23:55.950 --> 02:23:55.960 align:start position:0%
on House Bill 508
 
02:23:59.190 --> 02:23:59.200 align:start position:0%
FN relative to decreasing assessment
 
02:24:03.230 --> 02:24:03.240 align:start position:0%
rates for entes providing Voiceover IP
 
02:24:05.990 --> 02:24:06.000 align:start position:0%
and IP enabled Services as well as
 
02:24:08.750 --> 02:24:08.760 align:start position:0%
certain local exchange carry carriers
 
02:24:11.510 --> 02:24:11.520 align:start position:0%
and their Affiliates and so I'm going a
 
02:24:14.710 --> 02:24:14.720 align:start position:0%
call to the table testimony table the
 
02:24:17.429 --> 02:24:17.439 align:start position:0%
Bill's Prime sponsor representative
 
02:24:24.309 --> 02:24:24.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:27.309 --> 02:24:27.319 align:start position:0%
good morning um this bill is is is sort
 
02:24:30.469 --> 02:24:30.479 align:start position:0%
of a u i I might call it a hangover bill
 
02:24:32.830 --> 02:24:32.840 align:start position:0%
from the times of old regulations that
 
02:24:35.630 --> 02:24:35.640 align:start position:0%
no longer exist uh we have companies
 
02:24:37.309 --> 02:24:37.319 align:start position:0%
that are paying fees to the Public
 
02:24:39.309 --> 02:24:39.319 align:start position:0%
Utilities Commission that used to be
 
02:24:40.750 --> 02:24:40.760 align:start position:0%
regulated by the Public Utilities
 
02:24:43.349 --> 02:24:43.359 align:start position:0%
Commission but now they're not and the
 
02:24:46.870 --> 02:24:46.880 align:start position:0%
idea was you know that like an electric
 
02:24:49.269 --> 02:24:49.279 align:start position:0%
utility now pays in a certain percentage
 
02:24:51.110 --> 02:24:51.120 align:start position:0%
to fund the Pu
 
02:24:54.710 --> 02:24:54.720 align:start position:0%
so that the the cost of the regulation
 
02:24:56.590 --> 02:24:56.600 align:start position:0%
came from the people being regulated but
 
02:24:58.550 --> 02:24:58.560 align:start position:0%
in the case of these companies and the
 
02:25:00.070 --> 02:25:00.080 align:start position:0%
speaker will come after me can go into
 
02:25:02.030 --> 02:25:02.040 align:start position:0%
much more detail they are no longer
 
02:25:03.710 --> 02:25:03.720 align:start position:0%
regulated we don't regulate VoIP we
 
02:25:06.830 --> 02:25:06.840 align:start position:0%
don't regulate uh IP enabled uh Services
 
02:25:08.790 --> 02:25:08.800 align:start position:0%
we don't regulate any of that stuff uh
 
02:25:10.910 --> 02:25:10.920 align:start position:0%
there's basically no regulations left on
 
02:25:13.550 --> 02:25:13.560 align:start position:0%
phones uh with the exception of a very
 
02:25:15.670 --> 02:25:15.680 align:start position:0%
very slight amount but it's almost
 
02:25:17.830 --> 02:25:17.840 align:start position:0%
negligible and what this bill does is
 
02:25:19.469 --> 02:25:19.479 align:start position:0%
simply takes the assessment that they
 
02:25:22.870 --> 02:25:22.880 align:start position:0%
were paying of3 3 3% and drops it to 10%
 
02:25:25.469 --> 02:25:25.479 align:start position:0%
so like I say I'll defer to someone who
 
02:25:27.230 --> 02:25:27.240 align:start position:0%
can ask specific questions on it or
 
02:25:28.630 --> 02:25:28.640 align:start position:0%
answer specific questions on it but
 
02:25:30.190 --> 02:25:30.200 align:start position:0%
that's basically the intent of the bill
 
02:25:32.230 --> 02:25:32.240 align:start position:0%
it's just to bring us up to the reality
 
02:25:33.870 --> 02:25:33.880 align:start position:0%
of the fact that we're charging
 
02:25:36.070 --> 02:25:36.080 align:start position:0%
companies to pay for regulation that
 
02:25:39.230 --> 02:25:39.240 align:start position:0%
they no longer a part of okay well I do
 
02:25:42.150 --> 02:25:42.160 align:start position:0%
have to ask you one question sorry but
 
02:25:45.750 --> 02:25:45.760 align:start position:0%
it just kind of jumped out at me on line
 
02:25:49.830 --> 02:25:49.840 align:start position:0%
three the number 33 has changed to 10%
 
02:25:51.230 --> 02:25:51.240 align:start position:0%
to 10
 
02:25:54.910 --> 02:25:54.920 align:start position:0%
but online 4 33
 
02:25:58.710 --> 02:25:58.720 align:start position:0%
is um repeated should that be change to
 
02:26:00.790 --> 02:26:00.800 align:start position:0%
10 or or are we talking about two
 
02:26:03.590 --> 02:26:03.600 align:start position:0%
different things there
 
02:26:05.910 --> 02:26:05.920 align:start position:0%
um I would think it should be but I'll
 
02:26:07.830 --> 02:26:07.840 align:start position:0%

coverage uh the nhda members have been
 
02:27:29.389 --> 02:27:29.399 align:start position:0%
deregulated since
 
02:27:32.070 --> 02:27:32.080 align:start position:0%
2011 and in that time we've seen our
 
02:27:33.910 --> 02:27:33.920 align:start position:0%
interactions with the Public Utilities
 
02:27:37.550 --> 02:27:37.560 align:start position:0%

5 years for my company in particular uh
 
02:27:55.230 --> 02:27:55.240 align:start position:0%
over those years we've received two
 
02:27:59.830 --> 02:27:59.840 align:start position:0%
complaints uh through the Pu related to
 
02:28:02.870 --> 02:28:02.880 align:start position:0%
customers uh in 2011 the law that
 
02:28:05.429 --> 02:28:05.439 align:start position:0%
deregulated all of us also moved
 
02:28:07.870 --> 02:28:07.880 align:start position:0%
consumer complaints uh under the purview
 
02:28:10.269 --> 02:28:10.279 align:start position:0%
of the Attorney General and we've not
 
02:28:12.309 --> 02:28:12.319 align:start position:0%
received any complaints from
 
02:28:16.670 --> 02:28:16.680 align:start position:0%
them one stipulation of the 2011
 
02:28:18.750 --> 02:28:18.760 align:start position:0%
deregulation includes limits on the
 
02:28:20.870 --> 02:28:20.880 align:start position:0%
frequency and the magnitude ude of
 
02:28:23.150 --> 02:28:23.160 align:start position:0%
increases to basic telephone service
 
02:28:25.389 --> 02:28:25.399 align:start position:0%
which is simply dial tone service
 
02:28:25.399 --> 02:28:26.349 align:start position:0%
which is simply dial tone service
nothing

02:28:26.349 --> 02:28:26.359 align:start position:0%
nothing
 
02:28:29.630 --> 02:28:29.640 align:start position:0%
else by Design the pu's
 
02:28:31.910 --> 02:28:31.920 align:start position:0%
responsibility for reviewing those
 
02:28:35.990 --> 02:28:36.000 align:start position:0%
pricing changes expired after eight
 
02:28:38.630 --> 02:28:38.640 align:start position:0%
years today the Pu is working on the
 
02:28:41.630 --> 02:28:41.640 align:start position:0%
save the 603 numbering effort uh this
 
02:28:44.830 --> 02:28:44.840 align:start position:0%
docket marks a shift to assessing docket
 
02:28:47.230 --> 02:28:47.240 align:start position:0%
participants rather than relying on the
 
02:28:50.269 --> 02:28:50.279 align:start position:0%
mandatory annual assessment this means
 
02:28:52.750 --> 02:28:52.760 align:start position:0%
that the nhta companies are actually
 
02:28:56.190 --> 02:28:56.200 align:start position:0%
paying twice our annual assessment and
 
02:28:59.670 --> 02:28:59.680 align:start position:0%
the invoices related to this specific
 
02:29:02.590 --> 02:29:02.600 align:start position:0%
docket we feel that by reducing the
 
02:29:05.110 --> 02:29:05.120 align:start position:0%
level of annual assessments nhta
 
02:29:07.590 --> 02:29:07.600 align:start position:0%
companies we'll have additional funds
 
02:29:09.389 --> 02:29:09.399 align:start position:0%
available to direct towards completing
 
02:29:12.070 --> 02:29:12.080 align:start position:0%
our fiber networks and also conver
 
02:29:15.190 --> 02:29:15.200 align:start position:0%
converting customers to those
 
02:29:17.950 --> 02:29:17.960 align:start position:0%
networks given these facts we maintain
 
02:29:20.230 --> 02:29:20.240 align:start position:0%
the traditional assessment level is UN
 
02:29:24.790 --> 02:29:24.800 align:start position:0%
necessary and moving from 33% to 10%
 
02:29:27.269 --> 02:29:27.279 align:start position:0%
better reflects the funding level
 
02:29:30.150 --> 02:29:30.160 align:start position:0%
necessary to support telecommun modern
 
02:29:30.160 --> 02:29:32.030 align:start position:0%

telecommunications
 
02:29:34.550 --> 02:29:34.560 align:start position:0%
oversight uh now we are not seeking to
 
02:29:36.990 --> 02:29:37.000 align:start position:0%
eliminate the assessment only to reduce
 
02:29:39.590 --> 02:29:39.600 align:start position:0%
them to a level that reflects the pu's
 
02:29:41.190 --> 02:29:41.200 align:start position:0%
reduced oversight of the
 
02:29:41.200 --> 02:29:44.750 align:start position:0%

Bernstein Shore I'm here representing

02:30:24.349 --> 02:30:24.359 align:start position:0%
Association which is all the landline

language we sent to um representative
 
02:30:39.590 --> 02:30:39.600 align:start position:0%
Harrington and he sent to OS did have
 
02:30:42.269 --> 02:30:42.279 align:start position:0%
that other 33% change to
 
02:30:46.950 --> 02:30:46.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:50.670 --> 02:30:50.680 align:start position:0%
that so thank you thank you thank you
 
02:30:52.190 --> 02:30:52.200 align:start position:0%
and thank you representative Harrington
 
02:30:54.910 --> 02:30:54.920 align:start position:0%
and sumers for sponsoring this bill as
 
02:30:57.469 --> 02:30:57.479 align:start position:0%
you've heard it's a very simple Bill
 
02:31:00.469 --> 02:31:00.479 align:start position:0%
deregulation went into effect in
 
02:31:04.190 --> 02:31:04.200 align:start position:0%
2012 now we are 12 years later and the
 
02:31:07.670 --> 02:31:07.680 align:start position:0%
assessments went down back in
 
02:31:12.590 --> 02:31:12.600 align:start position:0%
2016 but we still are being assessed um
 
02:31:15.269 --> 02:31:15.279 align:start position:0%
we believe at a rate that's not
 
02:31:17.750 --> 02:31:17.760 align:start position:0%
comminate with the services we're
 
02:31:20.429 --> 02:31:20.439 align:start position:0%
receiving so what I did did and the
 
02:31:22.950 --> 02:31:22.960 align:start position:0%
reason I'm here with Chris is because I
 
02:31:25.349 --> 02:31:25.359 align:start position:0%
ped all the members some of the
 
02:31:28.150 --> 02:31:28.160 align:start position:0%
information is confidential so you get
 
02:31:31.550 --> 02:31:31.560 align:start position:0%
me for that information and as Chris
 
02:31:34.710 --> 02:31:34.720 align:start position:0%
said yes everybody does filings to the
 
02:31:37.750 --> 02:31:37.760 align:start position:0%
FCC it's the high cost calf filings that
 
02:31:40.590 --> 02:31:40.600 align:start position:0%
go through the department of energy um
 
02:31:43.670 --> 02:31:43.680 align:start position:0%
people have had and and what I let me
 
02:31:46.630 --> 02:31:46.640 align:start position:0%
back up and say I asked them to give me
 
02:31:49.510 --> 02:31:49.520 align:start position:0%
a five-year look back so I asked them to
 
02:31:51.110 --> 02:31:51.120 align:start position:0%
go back back to
 
02:31:55.750 --> 02:31:55.760 align:start position:0%
2018 or 19 so they all do the filings
 
02:31:58.429 --> 02:31:58.439 align:start position:0%
twice a year they go to the FCC they go
 
02:32:03.030 --> 02:32:03.040 align:start position:0%
they submitted to the Pu own
 
02:32:05.590 --> 02:32:05.600 align:start position:0%
complaints basically people aren't
 
02:32:08.269 --> 02:32:08.279 align:start position:0%
getting any complaints it's you know as
 
02:32:10.150 --> 02:32:10.160 align:start position:0%
Chris said in his case it was somebody
 
02:32:12.349 --> 02:32:12.359 align:start position:0%
wanting service in a certain section of
 
02:32:16.150 --> 02:32:16.160 align:start position:0%
wear or um somebody calling and saying a
 
02:32:19.030 --> 02:32:19.040 align:start position:0%
double cable was down but basically the
 
02:32:21.269 --> 02:32:21.279 align:start position:0%
complaints going from the AG's and
 
02:32:22.870 --> 02:32:22.880 align:start position:0%
through the AG's office and nothing's
 
02:32:27.070 --> 02:32:27.080 align:start position:0%
coming through they do get emails uh if
 
02:32:30.870 --> 02:32:30.880 align:start position:0%
there is a uh rules change if the rules
 
02:32:32.950 --> 02:32:32.960 align:start position:0%
being changed and going to jail car
 
02:32:34.870 --> 02:32:34.880 align:start position:0%
they'll send an email and say the rules
 
02:32:38.469 --> 02:32:38.479 align:start position:0%
are being changed here's the draft um
 
02:32:42.429 --> 02:32:42.439 align:start position:0%
they get the um they file the annual
 
02:32:45.910 --> 02:32:45.920 align:start position:0%
interestate 71 access rate
 
02:32:50.150 --> 02:32:50.160 align:start position:0%
filings and one company in 5 years had
 
02:32:52.670 --> 02:32:52.680 align:start position:0%
two interconnection agreement
 
02:32:55.469 --> 02:32:55.479 align:start position:0%
requests and what was interesting about
 
02:32:58.750 --> 02:32:58.760 align:start position:0%
that is they never heard from the Pu
 
02:33:01.670 --> 02:33:01.680 align:start position:0%
that it was done and so they only found
 
02:33:03.790 --> 02:33:03.800 align:start position:0%
out that it had been approved by going
 
02:33:05.030 --> 02:33:05.040 align:start position:0%
onto the
 
02:33:08.990 --> 02:33:09.000 align:start position:0%
docket now there are other issues out
 
02:33:11.389 --> 02:33:11.399 align:start position:0%
there which you know about dual pulse
 
02:33:13.469 --> 02:33:13.479 align:start position:0%
way back and I forgot the bill number
 
02:33:16.469 --> 02:33:16.479 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 16 or Senate Bill something
 
02:33:18.550 --> 02:33:18.560 align:start position:0%
anyway there's a bill years ago on
 
02:33:22.510 --> 02:33:22.520 align:start position:0%
double polls coming out of Rochester and
 
02:33:22.520 --> 02:33:24.389 align:start position:0%
double polls coming out of Rochester and
since

02:33:24.389 --> 02:33:24.399 align:start position:0%
since
 
02:33:27.910 --> 02:33:27.920 align:start position:0%
2023 that has been worked on at the Pu
 
02:33:30.389 --> 02:33:30.399 align:start position:0%
with the stakeholder grip so it's been
 
02:33:33.309 --> 02:33:33.319 align:start position:0%
all of the pole owners including
 
02:33:36.830 --> 02:33:36.840 align:start position:0%
electric and Telco working on removing
 
02:33:39.429 --> 02:33:39.439 align:start position:0%
double poles and as I understand it the
 
02:33:42.590 --> 02:33:42.600 align:start position:0%
pilot is starting in February so that is
 
02:33:46.110 --> 02:33:46.120 align:start position:0%
nearly over
 
02:33:49.349 --> 02:33:49.359 align:start position:0%
um for a Consolidated they sold their
 
02:33:53.950 --> 02:33:53.960 align:start position:0%
poll to ever source and that went before
 
02:33:57.630 --> 02:33:57.640 align:start position:0%
the Pu and it went P before the Pu
 
02:33:59.550 --> 02:33:59.560 align:start position:0%
specifically because they were being
 
02:34:02.269 --> 02:34:02.279 align:start position:0%
sold to an electric which is a regulated
 
02:34:06.309 --> 02:34:06.319 align:start position:0%
utility so that was done and completed
 
02:34:06.319 --> 02:34:07.150 align:start position:0%
utility so that was done and completed
uh

02:34:07.150 --> 02:34:07.160 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:34:10.670 --> 02:34:10.680 align:start position:0%
consolidated sold their assets they did
 
02:34:12.510 --> 02:34:12.520 align:start position:0%
a merger with
 
02:34:15.630 --> 02:34:15.640 align:start position:0%
Starlight um there was one hearing that
 
02:34:19.269 --> 02:34:19.279 align:start position:0%
did go before the Pu and it was a very
 
02:34:25.190 --> 02:34:25.200 align:start position:0%
fat fast quick and very successful uh
 
02:34:27.550 --> 02:34:27.560 align:start position:0%
outcome now what we get to go what's
 
02:34:30.389 --> 02:34:30.399 align:start position:0%
going forward the 603 area code and
 
02:34:32.110 --> 02:34:32.120 align:start position:0%
that's the rate Center
 
02:34:34.830 --> 02:34:34.840 align:start position:0%
consolidation that is going forward but
 
02:34:37.309 --> 02:34:37.319 align:start position:0%
you passed a bill last year that allows
 
02:34:41.550 --> 02:34:41.560 align:start position:0%
the Pu to assess all folks who have the
 
02:34:44.389 --> 02:34:44.399 align:start position:0%
603 area code who are in that docket a
 
02:34:46.630 --> 02:34:46.640 align:start position:0%
special assessment which is what Chris
 
02:34:49.910 --> 02:34:49.920 align:start position:0%
is talking about double taxation there
 
02:34:53.030 --> 02:34:53.040 align:start position:0%
the other um Bill you passed last year
 
02:34:54.550 --> 02:34:54.560 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill
 
02:34:57.110 --> 02:34:57.120 align:start position:0%
595 which having to do with the raate
 
02:35:00.550 --> 02:35:00.560 align:start position:0%
attachment disputes uh that you also are
 
02:35:04.590 --> 02:35:04.600 align:start position:0%
allowing a separate assessment so where
 
02:35:06.670 --> 02:35:06.680 align:start position:0%
we're coming here and a lot of the
 
02:35:08.230 --> 02:35:08.240 align:start position:0%
things that are being the special
 
02:35:09.630 --> 02:35:09.640 align:start position:0%
assessed are under the department of
 
02:35:12.429 --> 02:35:12.439 align:start position:0%
energy not the Pu so there's kind of a
 
02:35:14.349 --> 02:35:14.359 align:start position:0%
question from us about why are we paying
 
02:35:17.510 --> 02:35:17.520 align:start position:0%
an annual assessment to the Pu when a
 
02:35:19.750 --> 02:35:19.760 align:start position:0%
lot of this is actually working with the
 
02:35:23.070 --> 02:35:23.080 align:start position:0%
OE and I think it's because of the the
 
02:35:26.670 --> 02:35:26.680 align:start position:0%
the conversion of that of the department
 
02:35:30.870 --> 02:35:30.880 align:start position:0%
um so for us when we look at I've got
 
02:35:34.670 --> 02:35:34.680 align:start position:0%
the report here which is Blink thing uh
 
02:35:37.630 --> 02:35:37.640 align:start position:0%
utility assessments and when you really
 
02:35:40.630 --> 02:35:40.640 align:start position:0%
look at it on the Telco side most
 
02:35:43.670 --> 02:35:43.680 align:start position:0%
carriers of VoIP and with that they
 
02:35:47.349 --> 02:35:47.359 align:start position:0%
means you're paying $1,000 a year now my
 
02:35:49.070 --> 02:35:49.080 align:start position:0%
guess is three to five years everybody
 
02:35:50.910 --> 02:35:50.920 align:start position:0%
will probably be vo so everybody be
 
02:35:54.429 --> 02:35:54.439 align:start position:0%
paying that but it seems at this point
 
02:35:57.910 --> 02:35:57.920 align:start position:0%
it would be prudent to when I've named
 
02:36:00.429 --> 02:36:00.439 align:start position:0%
what really is going on which is these
 
02:36:04.070 --> 02:36:04.080 align:start position:0%
annual filings any complaint that may
 
02:36:07.550 --> 02:36:07.560 align:start position:0%
come that really a 10% assessment would
 
02:36:10.110 --> 02:36:10.120 align:start position:0%
be sufficient it seems to make sense
 
02:36:12.950 --> 02:36:12.960 align:start position:0%
that and and as I think we've talked
 
02:36:15.830 --> 02:36:15.840 align:start position:0%
about this is not reducing the puc
 
02:36:18.510 --> 02:36:18.520 align:start position:0%
budget what it's doing is assessing
 
02:36:20.110 --> 02:36:20.120 align:start position:0%
those who are using their
 
02:36:23.710 --> 02:36:23.720 align:start position:0%
Services uh more fairly so it's not a
 
02:36:25.870 --> 02:36:25.880 align:start position:0%
budget decrease it's not having staff
 
02:36:29.590 --> 02:36:29.600 align:start position:0%
fired or any of that or let go um it's
 
02:36:32.990 --> 02:36:33.000 align:start position:0%
literally saying if most of your work is
 
02:36:34.950 --> 02:36:34.960 align:start position:0%
electric they should be assessed or
 
02:36:37.870 --> 02:36:37.880 align:start position:0%
water or gas but let's just do it let's
 
02:36:40.110 --> 02:36:40.120 align:start position:0%
do it in a way that makes sense for
 
02:36:43.670 --> 02:36:43.680 align:start position:0%
everybody and for the companies for them
 
02:36:45.150 --> 02:36:45.160 align:start position:0%
it's money that can be put into
 
02:36:47.309 --> 02:36:47.319 align:start position:0%
Broadband I mean we all as you heard me
 
02:36:50.269 --> 02:36:50.279 align:start position:0%
last week here with the the bill on uh
 
02:36:52.429 --> 02:36:52.439 align:start position:0%
copper or Fiber everybody's working as
 
02:36:55.070 --> 02:36:55.080 align:start position:0%
hard as they can to get to 100% And we
 
02:36:57.349 --> 02:36:57.359 align:start position:0%
need the capital to do it so we should
 
02:36:58.990 --> 02:36:59.000 align:start position:0%
be able to take that and give it to the
 
02:37:01.429 --> 02:37:01.439 align:start position:0%
people who deserve it and not paying for
 
02:37:04.510 --> 02:37:04.520 align:start position:0%
services that we're not really receiving
 
02:37:07.190 --> 02:37:07.200 align:start position:0%
I'd be happy to answer any
 
02:37:10.349 --> 02:37:10.359 align:start position:0%
questions so I have a question thank you
 
02:37:13.670 --> 02:37:13.680 align:start position:0%
very much for for testifying if the p is
 
02:37:13.680 --> 02:37:14.870 align:start position:0%
very much for for testifying if the p is
over

02:37:14.870 --> 02:37:14.880 align:start position:0%
over
 
02:37:17.309 --> 02:37:17.319 align:start position:0%
assessing the companies that you
 
02:37:19.510 --> 02:37:19.520 align:start position:0%
represent what are they doing with that
 
02:37:21.510 --> 02:37:21.520 align:start position:0%
extra money do you have any
 
02:37:25.349 --> 02:37:25.359 align:start position:0%
idea no because because we're not
 
02:37:28.070 --> 02:37:28.080 align:start position:0%
hearing from them the companies I mean I
 
02:37:30.830 --> 02:37:30.840 align:start position:0%
you know I pulled all the companies on a
 
02:37:33.070 --> 02:37:33.080 align:start position:0%
joint call and then I called each one
 
02:37:36.590 --> 02:37:36.600 align:start position:0%
separately and said what go back I want
 
02:37:38.990 --> 02:37:39.000 align:start position:0%
you to go back and look for your emails
 
02:37:41.910 --> 02:37:41.920 align:start position:0%
I want you to call the people who pay
 
02:37:44.309 --> 02:37:44.319 align:start position:0%
the assessment I want you to hit
 
02:37:46.990 --> 02:37:47.000 align:start position:0%
everybody in your company that could
 
02:37:49.030 --> 02:37:49.040 align:start position:0%
have interaction and I'd like to know
 
02:37:50.349 --> 02:37:50.359 align:start position:0%
what it is
 
02:37:52.030 --> 02:37:52.040 align:start position:0%
and it's
 
02:37:55.269 --> 02:37:55.279 align:start position:0%
minimal except for except for I will say
 
02:37:56.590 --> 02:37:56.600 align:start position:0%
that's for everybody except for
 
02:37:58.429 --> 02:37:58.439 align:start position:0%
Consolidated and as I did say
 
02:38:00.710 --> 02:38:00.720 align:start position:0%
Consolidated had the merger which
 
02:38:03.990 --> 02:38:04.000 align:start position:0%
clearly their assessment of
 
02:38:07.710 --> 02:38:07.720 align:start position:0%
$300,000 or more was paying for that per
 
02:38:11.190 --> 02:38:11.200 align:start position:0%
year um and Consolidated certainly did
 
02:38:14.030 --> 02:38:14.040 align:start position:0%
have the pole sale and but those are
 
02:38:17.429 --> 02:38:17.439 align:start position:0%
done so you know at this point there's
 
02:38:19.750 --> 02:38:19.760 align:start position:0%
nothing really to pay for that they
 
02:38:22.429 --> 02:38:22.439 align:start position:0%
can't assess us for in a special
 
02:38:26.950 --> 02:38:26.960 align:start position:0%
assessment and let me say the companies
 
02:38:29.110 --> 02:38:29.120 align:start position:0%
I don't know whether Chris has but a
 
02:38:31.070 --> 02:38:31.080 align:start position:0%
number of the companies in nhca have
 
02:38:33.830 --> 02:38:33.840 align:start position:0%
already been assessed for the 603
 
02:38:35.990 --> 02:38:36.000 align:start position:0%
special assessment for the 603 area
 
02:38:37.469 --> 02:38:37.479 align:start position:0%
coach special
 
02:38:41.710 --> 02:38:41.720 align:start position:0%
assessment so can we assume that the
 
02:38:45.630 --> 02:38:45.640 align:start position:0%
lack of a pu objection to this bill
 
02:38:47.630 --> 02:38:47.640 align:start position:0%
means that they're fine with
 
02:38:50.389 --> 02:38:50.399 align:start position:0%
it well I would hope hope they're fine
 
02:38:52.550 --> 02:38:52.560 align:start position:0%
with it yes I mean I I would I would
 
02:38:55.150 --> 02:38:55.160 align:start position:0%
hope so I did speak with them and
 
02:38:59.309 --> 02:38:59.319 align:start position:0%
explain what why we were doing this and
 
02:39:01.469 --> 02:39:01.479 align:start position:0%
explain that we really weren't getting
 
02:39:03.630 --> 02:39:03.640 align:start position:0%
much service and when you look at it
 
02:39:06.630 --> 02:39:06.640 align:start position:0%
it's still you're still getting 10% of
 
02:39:09.870 --> 02:39:09.880 align:start position:0%
all the revenues of the so it's not as
 
02:39:11.830 --> 02:39:11.840 align:start position:0%
if they're not getting some still some
 
02:39:14.830 --> 02:39:14.840 align:start position:0%
good money that should cover what I call
 
02:39:14.840 --> 02:39:15.670 align:start position:0%
good money that should cover what I call
the

02:39:15.670 --> 02:39:15.680 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:39:18.349 --> 02:39:18.359 align:start position:0%
administrative cost of sending in the
 
02:39:20.190 --> 02:39:20.200 align:start position:0%
invoice for the for the special
 
02:39:22.269 --> 02:39:22.279 align:start position:0%
assessments or the assessments and the
 
02:39:23.590 --> 02:39:23.600 align:start position:0%
filings with the
 
02:39:26.830 --> 02:39:26.840 align:start position:0%
FCC okay thank you representative Corman
 
02:39:27.630 --> 02:39:27.640 align:start position:0%
has a
 
02:39:29.910 --> 02:39:29.920 align:start position:0%
question thank you but um my ranking
 
02:39:31.429 --> 02:39:31.439 align:start position:0%
member had her hand up and I would defer
 
02:39:31.439 --> 02:39:34.230 align:start position:0%
member had her hand up and I would defer
to

02:39:34.230 --> 02:39:34.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:37.429 --> 02:39:37.439 align:start position:0%
her representative McGee has a question
 
02:39:40.110 --> 02:39:40.120 align:start position:0%
Mr chair I did not instruct my committee
 
02:39:42.230 --> 02:39:42.240 align:start position:0%
to defer to me but it's very nice that
 
02:39:44.230 --> 02:39:44.240 align:start position:0%
they are my question was really what the
 
02:39:45.910 --> 02:39:45.920 align:start position:0%
difference in the money is if we could
 
02:39:47.469 --> 02:39:47.479 align:start position:0%
get a sense of that you've thrown out a
 
02:39:50.190 --> 02:39:50.200 align:start position:0%
couple of numbers but we can't sort of
 
02:39:52.870 --> 02:39:52.880 align:start position:0%
determine whether it's an impact or not
 
02:39:55.670 --> 02:39:55.680 align:start position:0%
um we have I I guess you know we don't
 
02:39:57.790 --> 02:39:57.800 align:start position:0%
know what percentage of the Pu budget it
 
02:40:00.190 --> 02:40:00.200 align:start position:0%
would represent but we can say we have
 
02:40:02.550 --> 02:40:02.560 align:start position:0%
33% versus 10% so what are you asking
 
02:40:05.630 --> 02:40:05.640 align:start position:0%
for versus what what is it
 
02:40:08.269 --> 02:40:08.279 align:start position:0%
today excuse me sorry I accidentally
 
02:40:10.070 --> 02:40:10.080 align:start position:0%
turned off your mic that's okay I'm GNA
 
02:40:12.990 --> 02:40:13.000 align:start position:0%
give you round numbers that I pulled out
 
02:40:16.670 --> 02:40:16.680 align:start position:0%
from the assessment and it will include
 
02:40:19.389 --> 02:40:19.399 align:start position:0%
um it will include the cable folks com
 
02:40:22.630 --> 02:40:22.640 align:start position:0%
cast time water Etc and this bill does
 
02:40:25.070 --> 02:40:25.080 align:start position:0%
include them this bill is not just for
 
02:40:27.750 --> 02:40:27.760 align:start position:0%
the Mel companies it's for for the the
 
02:40:30.910 --> 02:40:30.920 align:start position:0%
whole whole shebang of the telephone and
 
02:40:33.269 --> 02:40:33.279 align:start position:0%
um have the figures just for yeah who
 
02:40:35.309 --> 02:40:35.319 align:start position:0%
you were here representing other than oh
 
02:40:36.910 --> 02:40:36.920 align:start position:0%
would you want me to give you just who
 
02:40:38.190 --> 02:40:38.200 align:start position:0%
give me what you're talking about as
 
02:40:40.309 --> 02:40:40.319 align:start position:0%
long as I know what's in well you know
 
02:40:44.510 --> 02:40:44.520 align:start position:0%
for for the nhta companies we're
 
02:40:46.469 --> 02:40:46.479 align:start position:0%
probably talking about well let me say
 
02:40:49.349 --> 02:40:49.359 align:start position:0%
the NHC and the comcs companies we're
 
02:40:50.870 --> 02:40:50.880 align:start position:0%
probably talking about
 
02:40:53.550 --> 02:40:53.560 align:start position:0%
$400,000 maybe maybe a little more or a
 
02:40:55.670 --> 02:40:55.680 align:start position:0%
little less depending on what this next
 
02:40:58.670 --> 02:40:58.680 align:start position:0%
year is going to be and so I figure with
 
02:41:02.230 --> 02:41:02.240 align:start position:0%
that you're still going to be it's 33%
 
02:41:05.230 --> 02:41:05.240 align:start position:0%
down to 10% you're still going to be
 
02:41:07.590 --> 02:41:07.600 align:start position:0%
probably $140
 
02:41:10.070 --> 02:41:10.080 align:start position:0%
$150,000 which which is why I'm thinking
 
02:41:12.950 --> 02:41:12.960 align:start position:0%
that's perfectly fine for for the
 
02:41:15.950 --> 02:41:15.960 align:start position:0%
administrative cost particularly when uh
 
02:41:19.590 --> 02:41:19.600 align:start position:0%
the 603 and what you heard about Pol T
 
02:41:25.550 --> 02:41:25.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:28.269 --> 02:41:28.279 align:start position:0%
assessed follow up you did mention that
 
02:41:29.870 --> 02:41:29.880 align:start position:0%
you didn't think any jobs would be lost
 
02:41:32.429 --> 02:41:32.439 align:start position:0%
but if there's sort of a 20 and
 
02:41:34.309 --> 02:41:34.319 align:start position:0%
something it's a very small staff at the
 
02:41:36.469 --> 02:41:36.479 align:start position:0%
Pu at this point so I guess the question
 
02:41:38.710 --> 02:41:38.720 align:start position:0%
is how do you draw that conclusion I
 
02:41:41.230 --> 02:41:41.240 align:start position:0%
draw that conclusion because the way the
 
02:41:44.349 --> 02:41:44.359 align:start position:0%
statute um reads and I can pull it up
 
02:41:46.269 --> 02:41:46.279 align:start position:0%
here in a minute tell you uh where the
 
02:41:50.469 --> 02:41:50.479 align:start position:0%
statute reads is um
 
02:41:53.550 --> 02:41:53.560 align:start position:0%
the expenses thus not this is print
 
02:41:55.950 --> 02:41:55.960 align:start position:0%
small ascertained shall be assessed
 
02:41:57.910 --> 02:41:57.920 align:start position:0%
against the public utilities and other
 
02:42:00.950 --> 02:42:00.960 align:start position:0%
entities described in this section so
 
02:42:03.910 --> 02:42:03.920 align:start position:0%
their assessment is against all public
 
02:42:07.269 --> 02:42:07.279 align:start position:0%
their expenses are waged against all
 
02:42:10.230 --> 02:42:10.240 align:start position:0%
public utilities that they regulate and
 
02:42:14.269 --> 02:42:14.279 align:start position:0%
as they say the um the the others
 
02:42:16.309 --> 02:42:16.319 align:start position:0%
described in this section which is VoIP
 
02:42:18.830 --> 02:42:18.840 align:start position:0%
and Telco and the co-op because the
 
02:42:23.790 --> 02:42:23.800 align:start position:0%
co-op op vo um Telco Cable telephone and
 
02:42:25.230 --> 02:42:25.240 align:start position:0%
and the co-op are
 
02:42:29.309 --> 02:42:29.319 align:start position:0%
33% and everybody else is 100% so it's
 
02:42:32.990 --> 02:42:33.000 align:start position:0%
just the cost will get spread of their
 
02:42:35.269 --> 02:42:35.279 align:start position:0%
expenses under the people who are are
 
02:42:36.790 --> 02:42:36.800 align:start position:0%
the companies that are receiving the
 
02:42:38.630 --> 02:42:38.640 align:start position:0%
services actually I've heard that before
 
02:42:40.590 --> 02:42:40.600 align:start position:0%
thank you yeah well it's it's conf
 
02:42:43.750 --> 02:42:43.760 align:start position:0%
believe me it's confusing thank you okay
 
02:42:46.590 --> 02:42:46.600 align:start position:0%
now representative Corman I actually had
 
02:42:48.150 --> 02:42:48.160 align:start position:0%
the same question as representative
 
02:42:48.160 --> 02:42:49.990 align:start position:0%
the same question as representative
McGee

02:42:49.990 --> 02:42:50.000 align:start position:0%
McGee
 
02:42:51.630 --> 02:42:51.640 align:start position:0%
then you should have asked it okay
 
02:42:53.870 --> 02:42:53.880 align:start position:0%
representative Thomas thank you and I
 
02:42:56.389 --> 02:42:56.399 align:start position:0%
also had the same question um but I had
 
02:42:56.399 --> 02:42:57.630 align:start position:0%
also had the same question um but I had
a

02:42:57.630 --> 02:42:57.640 align:start position:0%
a
 
02:43:01.070 --> 02:43:01.080 align:start position:0%
followup um I actually think this is um
 
02:43:03.870 --> 02:43:03.880 align:start position:0%
this appears to be a good bill and um it
 
02:43:07.510 --> 02:43:07.520 align:start position:0%
it kind of makes sense to me um what I
 
02:43:09.710 --> 02:43:09.720 align:start position:0%
would like to know is there any
 
02:43:13.469 --> 02:43:13.479 align:start position:0%
assurance that the savings that would
 
02:43:15.389 --> 02:43:15.399 align:start position:0%
that would come as a result of this bill
 
02:43:19.710 --> 02:43:19.720 align:start position:0%
would be invested in uh
 
02:43:22.630 --> 02:43:22.640 align:start position:0%
efforts for public or member benefit and
 
02:43:24.710 --> 02:43:24.720 align:start position:0%
that they wouldn't go to a CEO or
 
02:43:27.190 --> 02:43:27.200 align:start position:0%
anything like that do you want to take
 
02:43:28.550 --> 02:43:28.560 align:start position:0%
that or you want me to take it you take
 
02:43:30.030 --> 02:43:30.040 align:start position:0%
it for you and then I'll take it for the
 
02:43:33.950 --> 02:43:33.960 align:start position:0%
rest of the group uh in a word yes um
 
02:43:36.269 --> 02:43:36.279 align:start position:0%
each company is required to certify that
 
02:43:37.830 --> 02:43:37.840 align:start position:0%
the money that they're receiving each
 
02:43:40.349 --> 02:43:40.359 align:start position:0%
year is going to essentially building
 
02:43:44.990 --> 02:43:45.000 align:start position:0%
Broadband uh and not funding CEO
 
02:43:48.269 --> 02:43:48.279 align:start position:0%
salaries so I know for our company we
 
02:43:50.429 --> 02:43:50.439 align:start position:0%
would you know know for every dollar
 
02:43:53.230 --> 02:43:53.240 align:start position:0%
that we can't put to broadband means
 
02:43:56.230 --> 02:43:56.240 align:start position:0%
customers don't get connected so the
 
02:44:00.710 --> 02:44:00.720 align:start position:0%
looking back over this uh the years uh
 
02:44:03.750 --> 02:44:03.760 align:start position:0%
when we have not been regulated probably
 
02:44:06.230 --> 02:44:06.240 align:start position:0%
if you took all of the households around
 
02:44:09.110 --> 02:44:09.120 align:start position:0%
this table and doubled it that's the
 
02:44:11.309 --> 02:44:11.319 align:start position:0%
equivalent of people who would not have
 
02:44:13.750 --> 02:44:13.760 align:start position:0%
been connected to the network so it
 
02:44:15.710 --> 02:44:15.720 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean people don't get connected
 
02:44:17.830 --> 02:44:17.840 align:start position:0%
it just means that they're pushed off so
 
02:44:20.309 --> 02:44:20.319 align:start position:0%
a reduction in these costs cost simply
 
02:44:23.790 --> 02:44:23.800 align:start position:0%
allows us to pull those jobs forward and
 
02:44:26.830 --> 02:44:26.840 align:start position:0%
connect more people
 
02:44:29.750 --> 02:44:29.760 align:start position:0%
faster and I think that is true for all
 
02:44:32.309 --> 02:44:32.319 align:start position:0%
of the companies and and because they
 
02:44:34.389 --> 02:44:34.399 align:start position:0%
all are totally committed to getting to
 
02:44:36.510 --> 02:44:36.520 align:start position:0%
that 100% plus it's a competitive
 
02:44:39.510 --> 02:44:39.520 align:start position:0%
Marketplace so you want to hit as many
 
02:44:42.269 --> 02:44:42.279 align:start position:0%
people as you can so you can serve them
 
02:44:44.790 --> 02:44:44.800 align:start position:0%
followup H
 
02:44:48.190 --> 02:44:48.200 align:start position:0%
up sorry um so in your opinion would
 
02:44:51.950 --> 02:44:51.960 align:start position:0%
this um reduction in how much is paid
 
02:44:59.030 --> 02:44:59.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:02.990 --> 02:45:03.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire you take it potentially um
 
02:45:05.469 --> 02:45:05.479 align:start position:0%
were we to have more funds to connect
 
02:45:08.150 --> 02:45:08.160 align:start position:0%
customers to broadband we certainly
 
02:45:10.670 --> 02:45:10.680 align:start position:0%
would there could be an opportunity
 
02:45:13.110 --> 02:45:13.120 align:start position:0%
based on how much of a reduction in
 
02:45:15.429 --> 02:45:15.439 align:start position:0%
expenses there are there's a potential
 
02:45:17.990 --> 02:45:18.000 align:start position:0%
that we could hire additional installers
 
02:45:20.750 --> 02:45:20.760 align:start position:0%
purchase more equipment and get those uh
 
02:45:22.790 --> 02:45:22.800 align:start position:0%
customers connected faster so there
 
02:45:25.030 --> 02:45:25.040 align:start position:0%
definitely is a potential yes thank you
 
02:45:27.590 --> 02:45:27.600 align:start position:0%
there's there's also the the potential
 
02:45:30.269 --> 02:45:30.279 align:start position:0%
that when you connect those customers
 
02:45:32.910 --> 02:45:32.920 align:start position:0%
they may well all of a sudden have jobs
 
02:45:34.870 --> 02:45:34.880 align:start position:0%
as well you may when you connect people
 
02:45:36.349 --> 02:45:36.359 align:start position:0%
they may be able to work particularly
 
02:45:38.710 --> 02:45:38.720 align:start position:0%
those in the area the rural areas so
 
02:45:41.190 --> 02:45:41.200 align:start position:0%
thank you for the
 
02:45:43.750 --> 02:45:43.760 align:start position:0%
question representative M thought of
 
02:45:47.389 --> 02:45:47.399 align:start position:0%
another question I did and the question
 
02:45:50.630 --> 02:45:50.640 align:start position:0%
is if the the uh expenses of the Public
 
02:45:53.590 --> 02:45:53.600 align:start position:0%
Utilities Commission are distributed
 
02:45:55.349 --> 02:45:55.359 align:start position:0%
amongst everybody else and you guys get
 
02:45:57.630 --> 02:45:57.640 align:start position:0%
a discount how much does that affect
 
02:45:59.510 --> 02:45:59.520 align:start position:0%
them I'm just think we should have the
 
02:46:02.389 --> 02:46:02.399 align:start position:0%
whole picture before
 
02:46:05.110 --> 02:46:05.120 align:start position:0%
we it it should be by exactly the same
 
02:46:06.630 --> 02:46:06.640 align:start position:0%
amount but I'm just saying what is it
 
02:46:08.630 --> 02:46:08.640 align:start position:0%
distributed over in terms of what kind
 
02:46:10.830 --> 02:46:10.840 align:start position:0%
of an impact that will be
 
02:46:13.510 --> 02:46:13.520 align:start position:0%
to that's a good question for them I'm
 
02:46:15.429 --> 02:46:15.439 align:start position:0%
assuming we're talking about somewhere
 
02:46:15.439 --> 02:46:16.870 align:start position:0%
assuming we're talking about somewhere
around

02:46:16.870 --> 02:46:16.880 align:start position:0%
around
 
02:46:19.750 --> 02:46:19.760 align:start position:0%
$250,000 which and I'm assum assuming
 
02:46:21.710 --> 02:46:21.720 align:start position:0%
that probably the majority of their
 
02:46:25.990 --> 02:46:26.000 align:start position:0%
works on the electric side and um but it
 
02:46:28.469 --> 02:46:28.479 align:start position:0%
would be distributed between the
 
02:46:33.150 --> 02:46:33.160 align:start position:0%
electric gas and water utilities so I'm
 
02:46:35.269 --> 02:46:35.279 align:start position:0%
not sure how much that difference that
 
02:46:36.469 --> 02:46:36.479 align:start position:0%
would make because I don't know how many
 
02:46:38.790 --> 02:46:38.800 align:start position:0%
customers I hope the Pu can they may be
 
02:46:42.269 --> 02:46:42.279 align:start position:0%
able to tell you but thank
 
02:46:45.230 --> 02:46:45.240 align:start position:0%
you all right representative Summers
 
02:46:47.349 --> 02:46:47.359 align:start position:0%
thought of a question thank you Mr
 
02:46:48.510 --> 02:46:48.520 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
 
02:46:50.349 --> 02:46:50.359 align:start position:0%
question and I I was actually really I
 
02:46:51.990 --> 02:46:52.000 align:start position:0%
was very happy and excited to actually
 
02:46:54.150 --> 02:46:54.160 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor this bill and the qu
 
02:46:56.030 --> 02:46:56.040 align:start position:0%
questions just I had real quick and it
 
02:46:58.830 --> 02:46:58.840 align:start position:0%
might go along with the RSA or even
 
02:47:00.910 --> 02:47:00.920 align:start position:0%
possibly future administration of it but
 
02:47:03.349 --> 02:47:03.359 align:start position:0%
I noticed it mentions just the Lex the
 
02:47:05.429 --> 02:47:05.439 align:start position:0%
local exchange carriers with the
 
02:47:08.349 --> 02:47:08.359 align:start position:0%
capability of Corporations be able to um
 
02:47:10.750 --> 02:47:10.760 align:start position:0%
create and with Hardware software be
 
02:47:12.349 --> 02:47:12.359 align:start position:0%
able to create and add and subtract
 
02:47:15.150 --> 02:47:15.160 align:start position:0%
their own VoIP would it be possible to
 
02:47:17.910 --> 02:47:17.920 align:start position:0%
think that all bar Broadband Services
 
02:47:19.349 --> 02:47:19.359 align:start position:0%
all cre
 
02:47:21.590 --> 02:47:21.600 align:start position:0%
vo services and therefore would fall
 
02:47:21.600 --> 02:47:25.870 align:start position:0%
vo services and therefore would fall
under

02:47:25.870 --> 02:47:25.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:28.670 --> 02:47:28.680 align:start position:0%
this I'm not familiar enough I'm not
 
02:47:30.550 --> 02:47:30.560 align:start position:0%
familiar enough with all the aspects of
 
02:47:32.790 --> 02:47:32.800 align:start position:0%
the current
 
02:47:36.590 --> 02:47:36.600 align:start position:0%
RSA uh I believe there are a long list
 
02:47:40.590 --> 02:47:40.600 align:start position:0%
of truly VoIP providers yeah providing
 
02:47:43.030 --> 02:47:43.040 align:start position:0%
service in New Hampshire and this
 
02:47:45.750 --> 02:47:45.760 align:start position:0%
applies to a small group who are being
 
02:47:47.990 --> 02:47:48.000 align:start position:0%
assessed at a much higher rate than all
 
02:47:51.630 --> 02:47:51.640 align:start position:0%
of those other vo providers who from my
 
02:47:54.309 --> 02:47:54.319 align:start position:0%
view of the list pay about $ thousand
 
02:47:57.870 --> 02:47:57.880 align:start position:0%
dollar a year the the vo providers the
 
02:48:01.750 --> 02:48:01.760 align:start position:0%
list the Pu puts out there's it's broken
 
02:48:05.389 --> 02:48:05.399 align:start position:0%
into Telco and vo and the vo providers
 
02:48:07.910 --> 02:48:07.920 align:start position:0%
are paying $11,000 a year the statute
 
02:48:10.590 --> 02:48:10.600 align:start position:0%
says that the for registration and the
 
02:48:12.790 --> 02:48:12.800 align:start position:0%
minimum you pay is
 
02:48:15.750 --> 02:48:15.760 align:start position:0%
$1,000 and so the vo providers are doing
 
02:48:19.389 --> 02:48:19.399 align:start position:0%
that and if if you change from to being

information that I think can help
 
02:49:19.590 --> 02:49:19.600 align:start position:0%
address some of the questions that just
 
02:49:21.710 --> 02:49:21.720 align:start position:0%
came up um so that is what I have for
 
02:49:23.429 --> 02:49:23.439 align:start position:0%
you today the department is neutral on
 
02:49:25.870 --> 02:49:25.880 align:start position:0%
this bill um so the department currently
 
02:49:28.630 --> 02:49:28.640 align:start position:0%
assesses all regulated utilities and
 
02:49:31.190 --> 02:49:31.200 align:start position:0%
other and certain other utilities
 
02:49:33.429 --> 02:49:33.439 align:start position:0%
including accepted local exchange
 
02:49:35.710 --> 02:49:35.720 align:start position:0%
carriers vo providers and providers of
 
02:49:38.990 --> 02:49:39.000 align:start position:0%
Ip enabled service for the expenses of
 
02:49:41.269 --> 02:49:41.279 align:start position:0%
the Pu and the expenses of the
 
02:49:43.190 --> 02:49:43.200 align:start position:0%
non-federally funded functions of the
 
02:49:45.510 --> 02:49:45.520 align:start position:0%
department supporting its regulatory
 
02:49:48.070 --> 02:49:48.080 align:start position:0%
obligations as well as expenses of the
 
02:49:49.790 --> 02:49:49.800 align:start position:0%
office of the consumer
 
02:49:52.790 --> 02:49:52.800 align:start position:0%
Advocate um the current assessment inv
 
02:49:55.309 --> 02:49:55.319 align:start position:0%
voices to expected local exchange
 
02:49:58.150 --> 02:49:58.160 align:start position:0%
carriers and certain vo providers and
 
02:50:00.469 --> 02:50:00.479 align:start position:0%
providers of Ip enabled Services um are
 
02:50:04.870 --> 02:50:04.880 align:start position:0%
based on 30 33% of gross utility revenue
 
02:50:07.750 --> 02:50:07.760 align:start position:0%
and this bill reduces that to uh 10%
 
02:50:10.550 --> 02:50:10.560 align:start position:0%
gross utility revenue it does not change
 
02:50:13.190 --> 02:50:13.200 align:start position:0%
the minimum um assessment of
 
02:50:16.710 --> 02:50:16.720 align:start position:0%
$1,000 so for fiscal year 25 the
 
02:50:18.990 --> 02:50:19.000 align:start position:0%
department assessed and I'll give you
 
02:50:21.550 --> 02:50:21.560 align:start position:0%
exact numbers
 
02:50:21.560 --> 02:50:23.269 align:start position:0%
exact numbers
529,000

02:50:23.269 --> 02:50:23.279 align:start position:0%
529,000
 
02:50:26.990 --> 02:50:27.000 align:start position:0%
to dollar to 26 accepted local exchange
 
02:50:30.309 --> 02:50:30.319 align:start position:0%
carriers out of 171
 
02:50:34.670 --> 02:50:34.680 align:start position:0%
providers um if the assessment had been
 
02:50:37.469 --> 02:50:37.479 align:start position:0%
based on 10% of gross utility revenues
 
02:50:47.630 --> 02:50:47.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:50.309 --> 02:50:50.319 align:start position:0%
$158,600 would have instead been
 
02:50:51.670 --> 02:50:51.680 align:start position:0%
collected as part of the assessment
 
02:50:53.469 --> 02:50:53.479 align:start position:0%
invoices paid by other regulated
 
02:50:57.190 --> 02:50:57.200 align:start position:0%
utilities gas electric water and sewer
 
02:50:58.830 --> 02:50:58.840 align:start position:0%
um and the assessment costs are
 
02:51:01.030 --> 02:51:01.040 align:start position:0%
recovered by other regulated utilities
 
02:51:04.190 --> 02:51:04.200 align:start position:0%
through the rates charged to customers
 
02:51:06.630 --> 02:51:06.640 align:start position:0%
um in my letter that I'll send you there
 
02:51:09.950 --> 02:51:09.960 align:start position:0%
is a wide range of Duties supporting
 
02:51:12.309 --> 02:51:12.319 align:start position:0%
telecommunication providers that are
 
02:51:15.190 --> 02:51:15.200 align:start position:0%
covered by the assessment funds um and
 
02:51:16.950 --> 02:51:16.960 align:start position:0%
just I I would just give you a couple of
 
02:51:19.110 --> 02:51:19.120 align:start position:0%
them but I have I have quite a few um
 
02:51:20.870 --> 02:51:20.880 align:start position:0%
and that includes registration of new
 
02:51:23.309 --> 02:51:23.319 align:start position:0%
telecommunications providers review of
 
02:51:26.150 --> 02:51:26.160 align:start position:0%
daily requests for numbering resources
 
02:51:28.510 --> 02:51:28.520 align:start position:0%
um encompassing analysis of available
 
02:51:30.750 --> 02:51:30.760 align:start position:0%
resources in requested rate centers
 
02:51:32.830 --> 02:51:32.840 align:start position:0%
identification of blocks of numbers held
 
02:51:35.030 --> 02:51:35.040 align:start position:0%
by other providers solicitation of
 
02:51:36.910 --> 02:51:36.920 align:start position:0%
donations to the pool coordination of
 
02:51:38.750 --> 02:51:38.760 align:start position:0%
the transfer of number numbering
 
02:51:40.870 --> 02:51:40.880 align:start position:0%
resources among carriers uh and there's
 
02:51:42.349 --> 02:51:42.359 align:start position:0%
quite a few other things so I will give
 
02:51:45.070 --> 02:51:45.080 align:start position:0%
you the whole list that I have um I am
 
02:51:47.630 --> 02:51:47.640 align:start position:0%
happy to take uh any questions may have
 
02:51:49.830 --> 02:51:49.840 align:start position:0%
our experts can be available today to
 
02:51:52.110 --> 02:51:52.120 align:start position:0%
testify on this but um anything I can't
 
02:51:53.429 --> 02:51:53.439 align:start position:0%
answer I can take back to the department
 
02:51:54.870 --> 02:51:54.880 align:start position:0%
and make sure you
 
02:51:57.830 --> 02:51:57.840 align:start position:0%
get okay thank you
 
02:52:02.070 --> 02:52:02.080 align:start position:0%
so if we reduce the assessment on these
 
02:52:05.190 --> 02:52:05.200 align:start position:0%
this particular class of carriers will
 
02:52:07.790 --> 02:52:07.800 align:start position:0%
that increase the assessment on other
 
02:52:10.429 --> 02:52:10.439 align:start position:0%
carriers is that what I yes heard you
 
02:52:12.150 --> 02:52:12.160 align:start position:0%
say yes okay thank
 
02:52:15.510 --> 02:52:15.520 align:start position:0%
you further questions for the Department
 
02:52:19.469 --> 02:52:19.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:22.710 --> 02:52:22.720 align:start position:0%
well seeing none I guess uh you're done

thank you and so are we so that
 
02:52:27.790 --> 02:52:27.800 align:start position:0%
concludes the public hearing on House
 
02:52:27.800 --> 02:52:29.309 align:start position:0%

resiliency called C
 
04:18:34.670 --> 04:18:34.680 align:start position:0%

04:19:27.990 --> 04:19:28.000 align:start position:0%
535-nm minates certain grants of
 
04:19:29.830 --> 04:19:29.840 align:start position:0%
authority to the Public Utilities
 
04:19:32.870 --> 04:19:32.880 align:start position:0%
Commission and requires in any contested

case before the commission to which the
 
04:19:36.710 --> 04:19:36.720 align:start position:0%
department of energy and the office of
 
04:19:39.229 --> 04:19:39.239 align:start position:0%
the consumer Advocate are parties the
 
04:19:41.710 --> 04:19:41.720 align:start position:0%
commission to approve by order any
 
04:19:43.670 --> 04:19:43.680 align:start position:0%
settlement agreement to which all
 
04:19:46.269 --> 04:19:46.279 align:start position:0%
parties are a signatory unless the
 
04:19:48.670 --> 04:19:48.680 align:start position:0%
commission determines after hearing that
 
04:19:50.950 --> 04:19:50.960 align:start position:0%
any settlement provision is contrary to
 
04:19:53.550 --> 04:19:53.560 align:start position:0%
the law this bill is at the request of
 
04:19:56.389 --> 04:19:56.399 align:start position:0%
the office of the consumer Advocate uh
 
04:19:58.670 --> 04:19:58.680 align:start position:0%
you can ask me questions but uh I'll
 
04:20:01.030 --> 04:20:01.040 align:start position:0%
probably not be as familiar with it as
 
04:20:03.750 --> 04:20:03.760 align:start position:0%
some of the folks who are attending here
 
04:20:09.070 --> 04:20:09.080 align:start position:0%

necessary okay so repres representative
 
04:20:13.910 --> 04:20:13.920 align:start position:0%
Swanson has indicated that he would
 
04:20:15.910 --> 04:20:15.920 align:start position:0%
prefer not to take
 
04:20:18.070 --> 04:20:18.080 align:start position:0%
questions that okay with everybody looks
 
04:20:19.990 --> 04:20:20.000 align:start position:0%
like it is representative so thank you
 
04:20:22.750 --> 04:20:22.760 align:start position:0%
for introducing this bill and someone
 
04:20:25.630 --> 04:20:25.640 align:start position:0%
who I know will gladly take questions is
 
04:20:28.269 --> 04:20:28.279 align:start position:0%
our consumer Advocate Donald Cree so I'm
 
04:20:30.990 --> 04:20:31.000 align:start position:0%
going to call him next to testify on
 
04:20:31.000 --> 04:20:34.070 align:start position:0%
going to call him next to testify on
this

04:20:34.070 --> 04:20:34.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:36.309 --> 04:20:36.319 align:start position:0%
legislation uh thank you Mr chairman
 
04:20:39.309 --> 04:20:39.319 align:start position:0%
good afternoon to everybody thank you
 
04:20:41.670 --> 04:20:41.680 align:start position:0%
for the opportunity to testify I am
 
04:20:43.910 --> 04:20:43.920 align:start position:0%
Donald Cree I am the consumer Advocate
 
04:20:46.870 --> 04:20:46.880 align:start position:0%
my job pursuant to RSA
 
04:20:49.109 --> 04:20:49.119 align:start position:0%
36328 is to represent the interests of
 
04:20:51.630 --> 04:20:51.640 align:start position:0%
residential utility customers uh in a
 
04:20:54.189 --> 04:20:54.199 align:start position:0%
surfit of caution I feel obliged to
 
04:20:56.109 --> 04:20:56.119 align:start position:0%
disclose that the testimony I am about
 
04:21:00.229 --> 04:21:00.239 align:start position:0%
to give is going to refer to three open
 
04:21:03.030 --> 04:21:03.040 align:start position:0%
Public Utilities Commission dockets and
 
04:21:06.349 --> 04:21:06.359 align:start position:0%
that may have implications for RSA 363
 
04:21:08.990 --> 04:21:09.000 align:start position:0%
section 12 paragraph
 
04:21:13.149 --> 04:21:13.159 align:start position:0%
3 uh as representative Swanson indicated
 
04:21:15.269 --> 04:21:15.279 align:start position:0%
I uh proposed this bill and
 
04:21:16.950 --> 04:21:16.960 align:start position:0%
representative Corman was kind enough to
 
04:21:19.630 --> 04:21:19.640 align:start position:0%
introduce it on my behalf as consumer
 
04:21:22.550 --> 04:21:22.560 align:start position:0%
Advocate I care about two things safe
 
04:21:24.510 --> 04:21:24.520 align:start position:0%
and reliable service at the lowest
 
04:21:27.710 --> 04:21:27.720 align:start position:0%
possible cost and maximizing consumer
 
04:21:30.349 --> 04:21:30.359 align:start position:0%
Freedom by giving rate payers the agency
 
04:21:33.229 --> 04:21:33.239 align:start position:0%
they need to use energy and water as
 
04:21:36.269 --> 04:21:36.279 align:start position:0%
they see fit particularly as relates to
 
04:21:38.469 --> 04:21:38.479 align:start position:0%
the affordability prong utility
 
04:21:40.990 --> 04:21:41.000 align:start position:0%
regulation in New Hampshire is in my
 
04:21:43.349 --> 04:21:43.359 align:start position:0%
respectful opinion not not working right
 
04:21:46.550 --> 04:21:46.560 align:start position:0%
now and this ineffectiveness is costing
 
04:21:49.910 --> 04:21:49.920 align:start position:0%
rate payers a lot of money because every
 
04:21:52.670 --> 04:21:52.680 align:start position:0%
cent of the cost of regulating Utilities
 
04:21:55.309 --> 04:21:55.319 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire is recovered from
 
04:21:57.990 --> 04:21:58.000 align:start position:0%
customers via utility
 
04:22:00.070 --> 04:22:00.080 align:start position:0%
assessments now I have to say that my
 
04:22:01.990 --> 04:22:02.000 align:start position:0%
intentions here have been widely
 
04:22:04.030 --> 04:22:04.040 align:start position:0%
misunderstood when I floated a
 
04:22:06.750 --> 04:22:06.760 align:start position:0%
preliminary version of this bill uh by
 
04:22:08.670 --> 04:22:08.680 align:start position:0%
the residential rate payers Advisory
 
04:22:10.830 --> 04:22:10.840 align:start position:0%
Board which is the statutory advisory
 
04:22:13.630 --> 04:22:13.640 align:start position:0%
body to my office back in in October
 
04:22:15.550 --> 04:22:15.560 align:start position:0%
that produced an intemperate letter from
 
04:22:17.790 --> 04:22:17.800 align:start position:0%
chairman goldner and commissioner chadow
 
04:22:20.469 --> 04:22:20.479 align:start position:0%
Podi and it all got kind of personal I
 
04:22:22.030 --> 04:22:22.040 align:start position:0%
really regret that because the point
 
04:22:24.990 --> 04:22:25.000 align:start position:0%
here is not to criticize any of my
 
04:22:27.590 --> 04:22:27.600 align:start position:0%
fellow human beings it is rather simply
 
04:22:30.030 --> 04:22:30.040 align:start position:0%
to remind everyone of something that was
 
04:22:32.750 --> 04:22:32.760 align:start position:0%
acknowledged and understood in July of
 
04:22:35.510 --> 04:22:35.520 align:start position:0%
2021 actually I think it was June of
 
04:22:37.710 --> 04:22:37.720 align:start position:0%
2021 that is when the department of
 
04:22:39.349 --> 04:22:39.359 align:start position:0%
energy was created and the Public
 
04:22:41.830 --> 04:22:41.840 align:start position:0%
Utilities Commission was downsized and
 
04:22:44.510 --> 04:22:44.520 align:start position:0%
reconfigured Ed via that Year's Budget
 
04:22:47.109 --> 04:22:47.119 align:start position:0%
Trailer bill it was a hasty process
 
04:22:49.229 --> 04:22:49.239 align:start position:0%
undertaken at the very end of a
 
04:22:51.070 --> 04:22:51.080 align:start position:0%
legislative session and it was
 
04:22:53.229 --> 04:22:53.239 align:start position:0%
understood by everybody that the
 
04:22:55.910 --> 04:22:55.920 align:start position:0%
enabling statutes of the two agencies
 
04:22:58.630 --> 04:22:58.640 align:start position:0%
would have to be re-examined based on
 
04:23:01.550 --> 04:23:01.560 align:start position:0%
experience well four years later here is
 
04:23:03.950 --> 04:23:03.960 align:start position:0%
what experience suggests these two
 
04:23:07.229 --> 04:23:07.239 align:start position:0%
agencies need more specific legislative
 
04:23:09.269 --> 04:23:09.279 align:start position:0%
direction to the effect that the
 
04:23:11.750 --> 04:23:11.760 align:start position:0%
department of energy is the policy shop
 
04:23:14.910 --> 04:23:14.920 align:start position:0%
and the Pu 's job is to act more or less
 
04:23:17.229 --> 04:23:17.239 align:start position:0%
the way a court acts as a neutral
 
04:23:19.309 --> 04:23:19.319 align:start position:0%
decision maker when the interests of
 
04:23:21.510 --> 04:23:21.520 align:start position:0%
utility shareholders and the interests
 
04:23:24.030 --> 04:23:24.040 align:start position:0%
of utility customers need to be balanced
 
04:23:26.550 --> 04:23:26.560 align:start position:0%
against each other right now the two
 
04:23:28.710 --> 04:23:28.720 align:start position:0%
agencies seem to be talking past each
 
04:23:30.349 --> 04:23:30.359 align:start position:0%
other let me give you a couple of very
 
04:23:33.550 --> 04:23:33.560 align:start position:0%
recent examples from pending rate cases
 
04:23:36.189 --> 04:23:36.199 align:start position:0%
first is the Liberty electric rate case
 
04:23:37.870 --> 04:23:37.880 align:start position:0%
doc at De
 
04:23:40.710 --> 04:23:40.720 align:start position:0%
23039 the proceeding turned into a
 
04:23:44.469 --> 04:23:44.479 align:start position:0%
fiasco when in the fall of 2023 the
 
04:23:46.469 --> 04:23:46.479 align:start position:0%
Department's audit revealed that the
 
04:23:48.750 --> 04:23:48.760 align:start position:0%
books and records of the utility the
 
04:23:51.309 --> 04:23:51.319 align:start position:0%
basis of the whole rate case were
 
04:23:53.590 --> 04:23:53.600 align:start position:0%
unreliable this is what happens my
 
04:23:56.030 --> 04:23:56.040 align:start position:0%
friends when a utility transitions from
 
04:23:58.429 --> 04:23:58.439 align:start position:0%
one billing and accounting system to
 
04:24:00.870 --> 04:24:00.880 align:start position:0%
another in the middle of the test year
 
04:24:02.630 --> 04:24:02.640 align:start position:0%
that is used to calculate the utility's
 
04:24:04.670 --> 04:24:04.680 align:start position:0%
revenue requirement the department filed
 
04:24:06.990 --> 04:24:07.000 align:start position:0%
a motion to dismiss the rate case more
 
04:24:09.309 --> 04:24:09.319 align:start position:0%
than a year ago which the Pu for
 
04:24:12.630 --> 04:24:12.640 align:start position:0%
whatever reason has not acted upon
 
04:24:12.640 --> 04:24:16.429 align:start position:0%
whatever reason has not acted upon
excuse

04:24:16.429 --> 04:24:16.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:19.830 --> 04:24:19.840 align:start position:0%
me uh anyway uh the department filed a
 
04:24:21.349 --> 04:24:21.359 align:start position:0%
motion to dismissed the rate case more
 
04:24:24.030 --> 04:24:24.040 align:start position:0%
than a year ago the Pu hasn't ruled on
 
04:24:27.910 --> 04:24:27.920 align:start position:0%
it meanwhile the parties which is to say
 
04:24:29.990 --> 04:24:30.000 align:start position:0%
the utility the department and our
 
04:24:32.590 --> 04:24:32.600 align:start position:0%
office seeing no good outcome succeeded
 
04:24:34.630 --> 04:24:34.640 align:start position:0%
in negotiating a settlement agreement
 
04:24:36.389 --> 04:24:36.399 align:start position:0%
The Proposal basically maintains the
 
04:24:39.229 --> 04:24:39.239 align:start position:0%
status quo until 2026 when Liberty will
 
04:24:41.030 --> 04:24:41.040 align:start position:0%
file the new rate case but when the
 
04:24:42.910 --> 04:24:42.920 align:start position:0%
settlement came before the Pu for a
 
04:24:44.510 --> 04:24:44.520 align:start position:0%
hearing a few weeks ago the
 
04:24:46.349 --> 04:24:46.359 align:start position:0%
Commissioners made their distaste for
 
04:24:48.389 --> 04:24:48.399 align:start position:0%
the agreement plain they looked at the
 
04:24:49.910 --> 04:24:49.920 align:start position:0%
department and said you told us the
 
04:24:52.149 --> 04:24:52.159 align:start position:0%
books and records were unreliable so how
 
04:24:53.950 --> 04:24:53.960 align:start position:0%
can you now claim that the rates you
 
04:24:56.070 --> 04:24:56.080 align:start position:0%
have agreed on will be just in
 
04:24:58.550 --> 04:24:58.560 align:start position:0%
reasonable well here's why because every
 
04:25:01.149 --> 04:25:01.159 align:start position:0%
other alternative risks sending this
 
04:25:04.990 --> 04:25:05.000 align:start position:0%
utility into insolvency and an insolvent
 
04:25:07.710 --> 04:25:07.720 align:start position:0%
utility is bad for shareholders and bad
 
04:25:10.189 --> 04:25:10.199 align:start position:0%
for customers another example is the
 
04:25:13.790 --> 04:25:13.800 align:start position:0%
pending eversource rate case do de
 
04:25:16.630 --> 04:25:16.640 align:start position:0%
2470 this one's a bit more prosaic it's
 
04:25:19.510 --> 04:25:19.520 align:start position:0%
a big complicated case the Pu allowed
 
04:25:21.109 --> 04:25:21.119 align:start position:0%
the parties including the department of
 
04:25:23.510 --> 04:25:23.520 align:start position:0%
energy to Wrangle for months about the
 
04:25:26.109 --> 04:25:26.119 align:start position:0%
procedural schedule given the statutory
 
04:25:28.269 --> 04:25:28.279 align:start position:0%
deadline that looms this coming may we
 
04:25:30.670 --> 04:25:30.680 align:start position:0%
finally agreed on uh this past Friday as
 
04:25:33.109 --> 04:25:33.119 align:start position:0%
the big day the day everyone other than
 
04:25:35.309 --> 04:25:35.319 align:start position:0%
eversource would file their written
 
04:25:37.910 --> 04:25:37.920 align:start position:0%
testimony and then a couple of weeks ago
 
04:25:39.269 --> 04:25:39.279 align:start position:0%
the department decided it couldn't meet
 
04:25:41.550 --> 04:25:41.560 align:start position:0%
the deadline so the department asked for
 
04:25:44.750 --> 04:25:44.760 align:start position:0%
an extension the Pu said no and the
 
04:25:46.030 --> 04:25:46.040 align:start position:0%
department basically ignored the
 
04:25:47.950 --> 04:25:47.960 align:start position:0%
deadline leaving most of its testimony
 
04:25:51.229 --> 04:25:51.239 align:start position:0%
unfiled to this day a bigger example
 
04:25:53.950 --> 04:25:53.960 align:start position:0%
from last year is the commission's net
 
04:25:55.710 --> 04:25:55.720 align:start position:0%
metering dock at De
 
04:25:58.109 --> 04:25:58.119 align:start position:0%
22060 the parties reached a settlement
 
04:26:00.510 --> 04:26:00.520 align:start position:0%
the Pu didn't reject the settlement the
 
04:26:02.630 --> 04:26:02.640 align:start position:0%
commissioner simply ignored it in spite
 
04:26:05.070 --> 04:26:05.080 align:start position:0%
of broad consensus among the utilities
 
04:26:08.229 --> 04:26:08.239 align:start position:0%
my office and those who unlike me are in
 
04:26:09.590 --> 04:26:09.600 align:start position:0%
love with net
 
04:26:13.229 --> 04:26:13.239 align:start position:0%
metering so I cob P together my best
 
04:26:15.910 --> 04:26:15.920 align:start position:0%
ideas for how to fix things statutorily
 
04:26:18.670 --> 04:26:18.680 align:start position:0%
but my main purpose is is to incite
 
04:26:21.990 --> 04:26:22.000 align:start position:0%
dialogue here at the state house I'm not
 
04:26:24.109 --> 04:26:24.119 align:start position:0%
trying to make myself King and I am
 
04:26:26.349 --> 04:26:26.359 align:start position:0%
certain others who are smarter than me
 
04:26:28.550 --> 04:26:28.560 align:start position:0%
can think of approaches that would be
 
04:26:30.990 --> 04:26:31.000 align:start position:0%
even better than the ones I've suggested
 
04:26:32.670 --> 04:26:32.680 align:start position:0%
including tweaks to the language about
 
04:26:34.990 --> 04:26:35.000 align:start position:0%
settlement agreements because I just
 
04:26:36.950 --> 04:26:36.960 align:start position:0%
want this process to work to meet the
 
04:26:38.550 --> 04:26:38.560 align:start position:0%
needs of all
 
04:26:40.590 --> 04:26:40.600 align:start position:0%
stakeholders this could I suppose turn
 
04:26:42.750 --> 04:26:42.760 align:start position:0%
into a suicide mission there's serious
 
04:26:44.550 --> 04:26:44.560 align:start position:0%
talk here at the State House of
 
04:26:46.710 --> 04:26:46.720 align:start position:0%
abolishing my whole office but for me
 
04:26:48.429 --> 04:26:48.439 align:start position:0%
it's a matter of conscience the
 
04:26:50.910 --> 04:26:50.920 align:start position:0%
utilities won't ever speak out in favor
 
04:26:53.550 --> 04:26:53.560 align:start position:0%
of a bill like this utilities never do
 
04:26:55.870 --> 04:26:55.880 align:start position:0%
anything that might seem like criticism
 
04:26:58.630 --> 04:26:58.640 align:start position:0%
of their regulator I get that I know all
 
04:27:00.349 --> 04:27:00.359 align:start position:0%
of the key deciders over at the Walker
 
04:27:02.750 --> 04:27:02.760 align:start position:0%
building all of them are good people who
 
04:27:05.149 --> 04:27:05.159 align:start position:0%
come to work every day striving to do
 
04:27:08.030 --> 04:27:08.040 align:start position:0%
the right thing they just need what was
 
04:27:10.510 --> 04:27:10.520 align:start position:0%
promised to them four years ago more
 
04:27:12.710 --> 04:27:12.720 align:start position:0%
clarity from the general court about
 
04:27:14.750 --> 04:27:14.760 align:start position:0%
what they are supposed to do and how
 
04:27:17.030 --> 04:27:17.040 align:start position:0%
they're supposed to do it uh that
 
04:27:18.990 --> 04:27:19.000 align:start position:0%
concludes my prepared testimony of
 
04:27:20.309 --> 04:27:20.319 align:start position:0%
course I'd be happy to answer any
 
04:27:22.269 --> 04:27:22.279 align:start position:0%
questions that the chairman might be
 
04:27:23.910 --> 04:27:23.920 align:start position:0%
willing to
 
04:27:26.349 --> 04:27:26.359 align:start position:0%
entertain thank you Mr chis we
 
04:27:29.030 --> 04:27:29.040 align:start position:0%
appreciate that testimony I do have a
 
04:27:32.429 --> 04:27:32.439 align:start position:0%
couple of questions for you in the bill
 
04:27:35.590 --> 04:27:35.600 align:start position:0%
on page two lines 5 through
 
04:27:39.710 --> 04:27:39.720 align:start position:0%
n there is new text describing the
 
04:27:43.269 --> 04:27:43.279 align:start position:0%
authority of the commission
 
04:27:44.870 --> 04:27:44.880 align:start position:0%
and it says that the commission can
 
04:27:46.630 --> 04:27:46.640 align:start position:0%
conduct contested
 
04:27:46.640 --> 04:27:48.750 align:start position:0%
conduct contested
adjudicative

04:27:48.750 --> 04:27:48.760 align:start position:0%
adjudicative
 
04:27:51.149 --> 04:27:51.159 align:start position:0%
proceedings uh within the meeting of RSA
 
04:27:54.309 --> 04:27:54.319 align:start position:0%
541 etc etc
 
04:27:57.229 --> 04:27:57.239 align:start position:0%
etc and it also can adopt administrative
 
04:27:59.990 --> 04:28:00.000 align:start position:0%
rules Etc but it doesn't say anything in
 
04:28:02.910 --> 04:28:02.920 align:start position:0%
here about whether the commission could
 
04:28:06.030 --> 04:28:06.040 align:start position:0%
undertake investigatory proceedings is
 
04:28:10.950 --> 04:28:10.960 align:start position:0%
that excluded on purpose or did you not
 
04:28:14.510 --> 04:28:14.520 align:start position:0%
think of that or is that Authority been
 
04:28:17.189 --> 04:28:17.199 align:start position:0%
transferred to the doe uh thank you Mr
 
04:28:18.670 --> 04:28:18.680 align:start position:0%
chairman that's an excellent question
 
04:28:23.750 --> 04:28:23.760 align:start position:0%
and I will say that yes my intention in
 
04:28:26.149 --> 04:28:26.159 align:start position:0%
uh as the original drafter of this bill
 
04:28:28.790 --> 04:28:28.800 align:start position:0%
was to clarify that the investigative
 
04:28:31.429 --> 04:28:31.439 align:start position:0%
role is now to be discharged by the
 
04:28:34.030 --> 04:28:34.040 align:start position:0%
department of energy now again that may
 
04:28:36.710 --> 04:28:36.720 align:start position:0%
or may not be the best answer that was
 
04:28:40.550 --> 04:28:40.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:43.429 --> 04:28:43.439 align:start position:0%
stage okay I have a follow-up question
 
04:28:46.349 --> 04:28:46.359 align:start position:0%
as well and that's on the same page if
 
04:28:50.389 --> 04:28:50.399 align:start position:0%
you go down to lines 25 and
 
04:28:54.590 --> 04:28:54.600 align:start position:0%
26 it states that
 
04:28:57.710 --> 04:28:57.720 align:start position:0%
uh essentially that settlement orders
 
04:29:00.189 --> 04:29:00.199 align:start position:0%
shall be approved by the or settlement
 
04:29:02.030 --> 04:29:02.040 align:start position:0%
agree agreements should shall be
 
04:29:04.790 --> 04:29:04.800 align:start position:0%
approved by the um that have been
 
04:29:08.750 --> 04:29:08.760 align:start position:0%
approved by the parties uh have to
 
04:29:12.990 --> 04:29:13.000 align:start position:0%
be accepted by the commission
 
04:29:16.189 --> 04:29:16.199 align:start position:0%
unless that the settlement provision is
 
04:29:21.070 --> 04:29:21.080 align:start position:0%
contrary to law so if a settlement
 
04:29:23.870 --> 04:29:23.880 align:start position:0%
provision didn't pass the just and
 
04:29:27.670 --> 04:29:27.680 align:start position:0%
reasonable cost standard would that
 
04:29:29.790 --> 04:29:29.800 align:start position:0%
justify rejecting the settlement
 
04:29:32.550 --> 04:29:32.560 align:start position:0%
agreement as being uh contrary to
 
04:29:32.560 --> 04:29:34.429 align:start position:0%
agreement as being uh contrary to
existing

04:29:34.429 --> 04:29:34.439 align:start position:0%
existing
 
04:29:37.030 --> 04:29:37.040 align:start position:0%
law uh I think in honest answer to that
 
04:29:38.349 --> 04:29:38.359 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman thank you that was another
 
04:29:40.590 --> 04:29:40.600 align:start position:0%
really excellent question is it depends
 
04:29:43.469 --> 04:29:43.479 align:start position:0%
if the record conclusively demonstrated
 
04:29:46.109 --> 04:29:46.119 align:start position:0%
that the rates uh agreed to in a
 
04:29:47.510 --> 04:29:47.520 align:start position:0%
settlement agreement did not meet the
 
04:29:50.149 --> 04:29:50.159 align:start position:0%
just and reasonable standard then yes
 
04:29:51.990 --> 04:29:52.000 align:start position:0%
that would make the settlement contrary
 
04:29:54.469 --> 04:29:54.479 align:start position:0%
to law and under this language the
 
04:29:56.710 --> 04:29:56.720 align:start position:0%
commission would have the authority to
 
04:29:56.720 --> 04:29:58.030 align:start position:0%
commission would have the authority to
reject

04:29:58.030 --> 04:29:58.040 align:start position:0%
reject
 
04:30:00.870 --> 04:30:00.880 align:start position:0%
it okay thank you additional questions
 
04:30:03.389 --> 04:30:03.399 align:start position:0%
for the consumer Advocate representative
 
04:30:07.189 --> 04:30:07.199 align:start position:0%
McGee thank you Mr chairman thank you um
 
04:30:11.510 --> 04:30:11.520 align:start position:0%
Advocate cre uh for taking my question I
 
04:30:13.149 --> 04:30:13.159 align:start position:0%
um was looking through the bill and I
 
04:30:15.550 --> 04:30:15.560 align:start position:0%
noticed I actually remember the 80 pages
 
04:30:18.389 --> 04:30:18.399 align:start position:0%
that was added and I I was one of the
 
04:30:20.510 --> 04:30:20.520 align:start position:0%
few people that actually read it and
 
04:30:21.910 --> 04:30:21.920 align:start position:0%
having had some background in
 
04:30:23.389 --> 04:30:23.399 align:start position:0%
organizational development I was
 
04:30:24.710 --> 04:30:24.720 align:start position:0%
concerned at the time and I don't know
 
04:30:26.389 --> 04:30:26.399 align:start position:0%
if you remember I actually mentioned to
 
04:30:28.109 --> 04:30:28.119 align:start position:0%
you that I was concerned at the time
 
04:30:30.429 --> 04:30:30.439 align:start position:0%
that in many places in the original
 
04:30:31.990 --> 04:30:32.000 align:start position:0%
legislation that created the department
 
04:30:32.000 --> 04:30:33.550 align:start position:0%
legislation that created the department
of

04:30:33.550 --> 04:30:33.560 align:start position:0%
of
 
04:30:36.349 --> 04:30:36.359 align:start position:0%
energy uh it stated both the commission
 
04:30:38.630 --> 04:30:38.640 align:start position:0%
and the department right and I thought
 
04:30:41.469 --> 04:30:41.479 align:start position:0%
at the time it was confusing to me that
 
04:30:42.630 --> 04:30:42.640 align:start position:0%
they would share all these
 
04:30:45.229 --> 04:30:45.239 align:start position:0%
responsibilities since one was an agency
 
04:30:47.870 --> 04:30:47.880 align:start position:0%
and one was a regulatory body um I
 
04:30:49.870 --> 04:30:49.880 align:start position:0%
thought it would create confusion so I
 
04:30:53.349 --> 04:30:53.359 align:start position:0%
was pleased to see that you have things
 
04:30:56.109 --> 04:30:56.119 align:start position:0%
struck in here to try and tighten up
 
04:30:59.149 --> 04:30:59.159 align:start position:0%
where the responsibilities lie but it
 
04:31:03.109 --> 04:31:03.119 align:start position:0%
seems like that might be um a large part
 
04:31:05.389 --> 04:31:05.399 align:start position:0%
of what you're doing is sort of cleaning
 
04:31:07.830 --> 04:31:07.840 align:start position:0%
up and then the other
 
04:31:12.469 --> 04:31:12.479 align:start position:0%
piece seems like it's more about the
 
04:31:14.469 --> 04:31:14.479 align:start position:0%
role of the Public Utilities Commission
 
04:31:18.750 --> 04:31:18.760 align:start position:0%
in terms of uh getting the proceedings
 
04:31:19.910 --> 04:31:19.920 align:start position:0%
to a
 
04:31:22.870 --> 04:31:22.880 align:start position:0%
resolution uh in a timely manner which
 
04:31:24.710 --> 04:31:24.720 align:start position:0%
again saves people money because they
 
04:31:27.189 --> 04:31:27.199 align:start position:0%
can do more throughput if they if they
 
04:31:29.590 --> 04:31:29.600 align:start position:0%
handle more cases so are both of those
 
04:31:33.870 --> 04:31:33.880 align:start position:0%
things objectives of this bill um and if
 
04:31:36.870 --> 04:31:36.880 align:start position:0%
if you could say a little bit more about
 
04:31:42.910 --> 04:31:42.920 align:start position:0%
uh the roles and how how you uh see the
 
04:31:46.630 --> 04:31:46.640 align:start position:0%
problem that we're currently facing uh
 
04:31:48.550 --> 04:31:48.560 align:start position:0%
thank you for more excellent questions
 
04:31:51.349 --> 04:31:51.359 align:start position:0%
representative McGee so with respect to
 
04:31:53.550 --> 04:31:53.560 align:start position:0%
the two issues that you just raised you
 
04:31:56.990 --> 04:31:57.000 align:start position:0%
have perfectly captured the first thing
 
04:31:59.469 --> 04:31:59.479 align:start position:0%
that I'm trying to get at here which is
 
04:32:01.269 --> 04:32:01.279 align:start position:0%
it was explicitly
 
04:32:03.710 --> 04:32:03.720 align:start position:0%
understood uh in
 
04:32:08.269 --> 04:32:08.279 align:start position:0%
2021 that there were ambiguities in
 
04:32:10.189 --> 04:32:10.199 align:start position:0%
those 80 pages in the Budget Trailer
 
04:32:12.710 --> 04:32:12.720 align:start position:0%
bill that you just referred to because
 
04:32:14.990 --> 04:32:15.000 align:start position:0%
people wanted the legislature at the
 
04:32:17.109 --> 04:32:17.119 align:start position:0%
time wanted and I I guess you didn't
 
04:32:18.790 --> 04:32:18.800 align:start position:0%
agree with it at the time but that view
 
04:32:20.229 --> 04:32:20.239 align:start position:0%
didn't Prevail the The View that
 
04:32:22.309 --> 04:32:22.319 align:start position:0%
prevailed was we're going to leave that
 
04:32:24.309 --> 04:32:24.319 align:start position:0%
kind of vague and Loosey Goosey and
 
04:32:26.109 --> 04:32:26.119 align:start position:0%
we're going to sort out what would work
 
04:32:28.070 --> 04:32:28.080 align:start position:0%
best you know who would do the
 
04:32:30.630 --> 04:32:30.640 align:start position:0%
investigating and who wouldn't and there
 
04:32:32.990 --> 04:32:33.000 align:start position:0%
were all sorts of authorities that
 
04:32:37.109 --> 04:32:37.119 align:start position:0%
were uh designated or or allocated to
 
04:32:40.149 --> 04:32:40.159 align:start position:0%
the department but not divested of the
 
04:32:42.510 --> 04:32:42.520 align:start position:0%
Pu and I I think everybody knew at the
 
04:32:44.309 --> 04:32:44.319 align:start position:0%
time that that was going to need to be
 
04:32:46.950 --> 04:32:46.960 align:start position:0%
addressed I think four years later it is
 
04:32:50.109 --> 04:32:50.119 align:start position:0%
time to address that question so so
 
04:32:51.830 --> 04:32:51.840 align:start position:0%
you've understood me perfectly as to the
 
04:32:54.830 --> 04:32:54.840 align:start position:0%
first point the second point is I I I
 
04:32:58.349 --> 04:32:58.359 align:start position:0%
really do feel like we need clarity
 
04:33:00.550 --> 04:33:00.560 align:start position:0%
about what the Pu is supposed to do and
 
04:33:04.109 --> 04:33:04.119 align:start position:0%
not supposed to do because having the Pu
 
04:33:05.949 --> 04:33:05.959 align:start position:0%
uh sort of flop around and conduct
 
04:33:07.990 --> 04:33:08.000 align:start position:0%
freewheeling investigative proceedings
 
04:33:10.269 --> 04:33:10.279 align:start position:0%
all the time costs a lot of money I walk
 
04:33:12.510 --> 04:33:12.520 align:start position:0%
into the Pu hearing room my meter
 
04:33:14.869 --> 04:33:14.879 align:start position:0%
doesn't really stop start I mean I you
 
04:33:16.429 --> 04:33:16.439 align:start position:0%
know there is there's an opportunity
 
04:33:18.470 --> 04:33:18.480 align:start position:0%
cost when I spend time in the Pu hearing
 
04:33:20.150 --> 04:33:20.160 align:start position:0%
room but I don't start a meter but I
 
04:33:21.910 --> 04:33:21.920 align:start position:0%
look in that room and there were 40
 
04:33:24.029 --> 04:33:24.039 align:start position:0%
people in there all of whom you know
 
04:33:27.429 --> 04:33:27.439 align:start position:0%
start up a a Time meter and charge time
 
04:33:29.830 --> 04:33:29.840 align:start position:0%
to this regulatory process and the rate
 
04:33:32.910 --> 04:33:32.920 align:start position:0%
payers get the bill and I I really think
 
04:33:35.109 --> 04:33:35.119 align:start position:0%
that that is not an economically
 
04:33:38.390 --> 04:33:38.400 align:start position:0%
efficient way to do utility regulation
 
04:33:41.470 --> 04:33:41.480 align:start position:0%
and I know that doing this efficiently
 
04:33:43.990 --> 04:33:44.000 align:start position:0%
and saving rate payers money is an
 
04:33:45.869 --> 04:33:45.879 align:start position:0%
objective that every single member of
 
04:33:47.990 --> 04:33:48.000 align:start position:0%
this committee has so that's what I'm
 
04:33:50.429 --> 04:33:50.439 align:start position:0%
trying to do and I'm not telling you
 
04:33:52.510 --> 04:33:52.520 align:start position:0%
that I have captured it perfectly here
 
04:33:54.510 --> 04:33:54.520 align:start position:0%
I'm just trying to have the conversation
 
04:33:56.789 --> 04:33:56.799 align:start position:0%
with you all you all are the
 
04:33:58.709 --> 04:33:58.719 align:start position:0%
representatives of the people you have a
 
04:34:00.551 --> 04:34:00.561 align:start position:0%
better sense of how to do this than I
 
04:34:01.349 --> 04:34:01.359 align:start position:0%
than I
 
04:34:05.510 --> 04:34:05.520 align:start position:0%
do yes followup so my followup would be
 
04:34:10.070 --> 04:34:10.080 align:start position:0%
about um the settlement process which is
 
04:34:12.349 --> 04:34:12.359 align:start position:0%
another piece that the bill Bill alludes
 
04:34:14.750 --> 04:34:14.760 align:start position:0%
to my understanding of the settlement
 
04:34:16.670 --> 04:34:16.680 align:start position:0%
process is that all of the parties have
 
04:34:19.230 --> 04:34:19.240 align:start position:0%
to come together and present evidence to
 
04:34:21.949 --> 04:34:21.959 align:start position:0%
the Public Utilities Commission for why
 
04:34:23.349 --> 04:34:23.359 align:start position:0%
they have reached the conclusion that
 
04:34:26.349 --> 04:34:26.359 align:start position:0%
they have so they provide the evidence
 
04:34:31.349 --> 04:34:31.359 align:start position:0%
um and I in in my understanding of it
 
04:34:32.789 --> 04:34:32.799 align:start position:0%
you know you would have to have a really
 
04:34:35.070 --> 04:34:35.080 align:start position:0%
good reason to either question the
 
04:34:38.189 --> 04:34:38.199 align:start position:0%
evidence or want to go find further
 
04:34:40.189 --> 04:34:40.199 align:start position:0%
Evidence or other evidence because
 
04:34:41.390 --> 04:34:41.400 align:start position:0%
that's that's how the proceedings
 
04:34:42.750 --> 04:34:42.760 align:start position:0%
normally have gone right is that the
 
04:34:45.349 --> 04:34:45.359 align:start position:0%
parties conclude come together and
 
04:34:49.070 --> 04:34:49.080 align:start position:0%
present you with the easiest solution so
 
04:34:50.990 --> 04:34:51.000 align:start position:0%
is that can you for the folks here who
 
04:34:52.310 --> 04:34:52.320 align:start position:0%
haven't had a lot of experience with the
 
04:34:53.750 --> 04:34:53.760 align:start position:0%
Public Utilities Commission and I know
 
04:34:54.629 --> 04:34:54.639 align:start position:0%
that you
 
04:34:57.310 --> 04:34:57.320 align:start position:0%
have is that the way it's been in the b
 
04:35:00.551 --> 04:35:00.561 align:start position:0%
in the past and it's different now or I
 
04:35:02.590 --> 04:35:02.600 align:start position:0%
mean I guess just paint for us a little
 
04:35:05.310 --> 04:35:05.320 align:start position:0%
bit of a picture of what the settlement
 
04:35:06.789 --> 04:35:06.799 align:start position:0%
process is intended to be and how you
 
04:35:09.070 --> 04:35:09.080 align:start position:0%
think it's deviating from that indeed
 
04:35:10.629 --> 04:35:10.639 align:start position:0%
I'm having Deja Vu because we had this
 
04:35:12.629 --> 04:35:12.639 align:start position:0%
exact same conversation at the jel car a
 
04:35:15.269 --> 04:35:15.279 align:start position:0%
few weeks ago about the pu's procedural
 
04:35:17.709 --> 04:35:17.719 align:start position:0%
rules and uh representative Lynn who of
 
04:35:19.789 --> 04:35:19.799 align:start position:0%
course is a very learned attorney uh and
 
04:35:21.750 --> 04:35:21.760 align:start position:0%
former judge had the same question that
 
04:35:26.269 --> 04:35:26.279 align:start position:0%
you just asked so there the Pu will tell
 
04:35:29.109 --> 04:35:29.119 align:start position:0%
you I'm pretty sure that when they
 
04:35:30.869 --> 04:35:30.879 align:start position:0%
review a settlement agreement they're a
 
04:35:33.189 --> 04:35:33.199 align:start position:0%
lot like a court in a child protective
 
04:35:34.830 --> 04:35:34.840 align:start position:0%
case they have this like kind of
 
04:35:38.349 --> 04:35:38.359 align:start position:0%
independent responsibility not just to
 
04:35:40.629 --> 04:35:40.639 align:start position:0%
uh bless what Mom and Dad have agreed to
 
04:35:42.310 --> 04:35:42.320 align:start position:0%
but consider the best interest of the
 
04:35:44.830 --> 04:35:44.840 align:start position:0%
child that's the analogy they draw the
 
04:35:46.429 --> 04:35:46.439 align:start position:0%
problem with that analogy is that in
 
04:35:49.109 --> 04:35:49.119 align:start position:0%
these pu proceedings you do have parties
 
04:35:52.150 --> 04:35:52.160 align:start position:0%
that are interested in the broad best
 
04:35:54.070 --> 04:35:54.080 align:start position:0%
interest kind of determination right you
 
04:35:56.910 --> 04:35:56.920 align:start position:0%
have my office representing residential
 
04:35:58.750 --> 04:35:58.760 align:start position:0%
rate payers and you have the department
 
04:36:01.390 --> 04:36:01.400 align:start position:0%
of energy representing the I guess
 
04:36:03.830 --> 04:36:03.840 align:start position:0%
policy imperatives that reflect the
 
04:36:05.869 --> 04:36:05.879 align:start position:0%
governor essentially and so when you
 
04:36:08.150 --> 04:36:08.160 align:start position:0%
have those two voices agreeing to
 
04:36:10.310 --> 04:36:10.320 align:start position:0%
something alongside whatever utility or
 
04:36:12.990 --> 04:36:13.000 align:start position:0%
utilities are involved and whatever
 
04:36:15.310 --> 04:36:15.320 align:start position:0%
third parties have chosen to be involved
 
04:36:17.310 --> 04:36:17.320 align:start position:0%
then then you really do have a really
 
04:36:19.789 --> 04:36:19.799 align:start position:0%
broad consensus that's been developed
 
04:36:22.029 --> 04:36:22.039 align:start position:0%
after a lot of work and thought and
 
04:36:24.390 --> 04:36:24.400 align:start position:0%
evidentiary development uh that I think
 
04:36:26.230 --> 04:36:26.240 align:start position:0%
is deserving of some degree of
 
04:36:28.910 --> 04:36:28.920 align:start position:0%
difference when it comes before the puc
 
04:36:30.830 --> 04:36:30.840 align:start position:0%
rather than just leaving the Pu free to
 
04:36:32.629 --> 04:36:32.639 align:start position:0%
go eh you know we don't like that we
 
04:36:34.429 --> 04:36:34.439 align:start position:0%
have a whole different approach in mind
 
04:36:36.949 --> 04:36:36.959 align:start position:0%
and we're seeing that that the trend has
 
04:36:39.510 --> 04:36:39.520 align:start position:0%
been more and more in that direction of
 
04:36:42.070 --> 04:36:42.080 align:start position:0%
just saying I don't care what all all of
 
04:36:43.910 --> 04:36:43.920 align:start position:0%
the stakeholders who have been meeting
 
04:36:45.629 --> 04:36:45.639 align:start position:0%
for months and exchanging evidence for
 
04:36:48.310 --> 04:36:48.320 align:start position:0%
months have all agreed to we you all
 
04:36:51.109 --> 04:36:51.119 align:start position:0%
agree to why we prefer X I I I just I
 
04:36:53.670 --> 04:36:53.680 align:start position:0%
think that's bad bad public policy so
 
04:36:56.189 --> 04:36:56.199 align:start position:0%
the bill I drafted says you can't really
 
04:36:58.830 --> 04:36:58.840 align:start position:0%
do that could you water that down or
 
04:37:00.510 --> 04:37:00.520 align:start position:0%
modify that a bit and create maybe a
 
04:37:02.789 --> 04:37:02.799 align:start position:0%
rebuttable presumption in favor of
 
04:37:04.470 --> 04:37:04.480 align:start position:0%
settlements or something yeah you could
 
04:37:07.109 --> 04:37:07.119 align:start position:0%
if you think my Approach is too extreme
 
04:37:08.470 --> 04:37:08.480 align:start position:0%
but I think it's a it's again it's an
 
04:37:11.189 --> 04:37:11.199 align:start position:0%
important conversation for you all to
 
04:37:11.199 --> 04:37:15.670 align:start position:0%
important conversation for you all to
have

04:37:15.670 --> 04:37:15.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:18.551 --> 04:37:18.561 align:start position:0%
representative Wendy Thomas thank you Mr
 
04:37:21.949 --> 04:37:21.959 align:start position:0%
chair um and thank you for being here uh
 
04:37:24.830 --> 04:37:24.840 align:start position:0%
I almost called you Dr Chas um Mr Chas
 
04:37:27.349 --> 04:37:27.359 align:start position:0%
um so can you tell me what would be
 
04:37:29.990 --> 04:37:30.000 align:start position:0%
eliminated with this bill is it time
 
04:37:33.670 --> 04:37:33.680 align:start position:0%
confusion money um and is there a direct
 
04:37:36.109 --> 04:37:36.119 align:start position:0%
benefit to rate payers if this bill
 
04:37:38.830 --> 04:37:38.840 align:start position:0%
would be passed it would eliminate all
 
04:37:40.750 --> 04:37:40.760 align:start position:0%
of well it would reduce all of those
 
04:37:43.150 --> 04:37:43.160 align:start position:0%
things I mean there there regulation
 
04:37:45.109 --> 04:37:45.119 align:start position:0%
costs money there's no doubt about that
 
04:37:46.789 --> 04:37:46.799 align:start position:0%
so and it's always important to think
 
04:37:50.150 --> 04:37:50.160 align:start position:0%
about like does the cost of regulating
 
04:37:52.709 --> 04:37:52.719 align:start position:0%
utilities justify the benefit of
 
04:37:54.830 --> 04:37:54.840 align:start position:0%
regulating the utilities but this bill
 
04:37:57.869 --> 04:37:57.879 align:start position:0%
is aimed at making that process more
 
04:38:01.551 --> 04:38:01.561 align:start position:0%
responsive and efficient to the
 
04:38:03.551 --> 04:38:03.561 align:start position:0%
stakeholders who after all are going
 
04:38:05.750 --> 04:38:05.760 align:start position:0%
before the Pu because they need
 
04:38:08.949 --> 04:38:08.959 align:start position:0%
something from the Pu good decisions
 
04:38:11.830 --> 04:38:11.840 align:start position:0%
that can either be acted on or relied
 
04:38:13.629 --> 04:38:13.639 align:start position:0%
upon or appealed
 
04:38:16.269 --> 04:38:16.279 align:start position:0%
from hope that was somewhat responsive
 
04:38:16.279 --> 04:38:17.830 align:start position:0%
from hope that was somewhat responsive
thank

04:38:17.830 --> 04:38:17.840 align:start position:0%
thank
 
04:38:21.551 --> 04:38:21.561 align:start position:0%
you so I'm still struggling with the
 
04:38:28.150 --> 04:38:28.160 align:start position:0%
language uh on lines 21- 26 on page two
 
04:38:32.750 --> 04:38:32.760 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry 23 through 26 on page
 
04:38:36.590 --> 04:38:36.600 align:start position:0%
two the language there says help help me
 
04:38:38.429 --> 04:38:38.439 align:start position:0%
understand this please the language
 
04:38:40.830 --> 04:38:40.840 align:start position:0%
there says in any contested case before
 
04:38:41.990 --> 04:38:42.000 align:start position:0%
the commission
 
04:38:43.709 --> 04:38:43.719 align:start position:0%
in which the department of energy and
 
04:38:46.269 --> 04:38:46.279 align:start position:0%
the office of the consumer Advocate are
 
04:38:48.429 --> 04:38:48.439 align:start position:0%
parties the Commission in a timely
 
04:38:51.189 --> 04:38:51.199 align:start position:0%
manner shall approve by order any settl
 
04:38:52.670 --> 04:38:52.680 align:start position:0%
settlement agreement to which all
 
04:38:54.830 --> 04:38:54.840 align:start position:0%
parties are a
 
04:38:58.029 --> 04:38:58.039 align:start position:0%
signatory by sign singling out the
 
04:38:59.629 --> 04:38:59.639 align:start position:0%
department of energy in the Office of
 
04:38:59.639 --> 04:39:01.230 align:start position:0%
department of energy in the Office of
Consumer

04:39:01.230 --> 04:39:01.240 align:start position:0%
Consumer
 
04:39:03.990 --> 04:39:04.000 align:start position:0%
Advocate does that mean
 
04:39:07.551 --> 04:39:07.561 align:start position:0%
that any settlement agreement which is
 
04:39:11.910 --> 04:39:11.920 align:start position:0%
Reed uh reached between parties do not
 
04:39:13.590 --> 04:39:13.600 align:start position:0%
include the department of energy or the
 
04:39:16.629 --> 04:39:16.639 align:start position:0%
consumer Advocate are not subject to
 
04:39:20.949 --> 04:39:20.959 align:start position:0%
this language correct again you know you
 
04:39:22.750 --> 04:39:22.760 align:start position:0%
obviously can amend the bill uh to
 
04:39:24.590 --> 04:39:24.600 align:start position:0%
change that but that was that's my
 
04:39:27.390 --> 04:39:27.400 align:start position:0%
suggestion okay thank you appreciate you
 
04:39:29.910 --> 04:39:29.920 align:start position:0%
help helping me understand that further
 
04:39:32.429 --> 04:39:32.439 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
04:39:37.510 --> 04:39:37.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:39.310 --> 04:39:39.320 align:start position:0%
um is
 
04:39:43.590 --> 04:39:43.600 align:start position:0%
it uh I mean would it be fair would
 
04:39:46.030 --> 04:39:46.040 align:start position:0%
would it be fair to
 
04:39:50.230 --> 04:39:50.240 align:start position:0%
characterize the um I guess what you're
 
04:39:52.390 --> 04:39:52.400 align:start position:0%
describing the
 
04:39:55.708 --> 04:39:55.718 align:start position:0%
evolution of the public utilities
 
04:39:59.110 --> 04:39:59.120 align:start position:0%
commission's role or the public
 
04:40:01.270 --> 04:40:01.280 align:start position:0%
utilities commission's
 
04:40:04.868 --> 04:40:04.878 align:start position:0%
Behavior since
 
04:40:09.270 --> 04:40:09.280 align:start position:0%
2021 as um sort of analogous to like an
 
04:40:11.030 --> 04:40:11.040 align:start position:0%
activist you know we hear people rail
 
04:40:14.430 --> 04:40:14.440 align:start position:0%
against activist judges who you know
 
04:40:20.030 --> 04:40:20.040 align:start position:0%
bring their own uh agenda or their own
 
04:40:24.070 --> 04:40:24.080 align:start position:0%
um biases to to a case as opposed to
 
04:40:26.708 --> 04:40:26.718 align:start position:0%
deciding the case on its merits and
 
04:40:28.708 --> 04:40:28.718 align:start position:0%
evidence presented is that do you see
 
04:40:30.030 --> 04:40:30.040 align:start position:0%
that that the Public Utilities
 
04:40:31.628 --> 04:40:31.638 align:start position:0%
Commission has become sort of like an
 
04:40:34.070 --> 04:40:34.080 align:start position:0%
rather than a neutral judge to to be an
 
04:40:34.080 --> 04:40:35.708 align:start position:0%
rather than a neutral judge to to be an
activist

04:40:35.708 --> 04:40:35.718 align:start position:0%
activist
 
04:40:38.110 --> 04:40:38.120 align:start position:0%
judge uh that is not the way I would
 
04:40:40.390 --> 04:40:40.400 align:start position:0%
characterize it I think what I've
 
04:40:42.670 --> 04:40:42.680 align:start position:0%
observed is is a Public Utilities
 
04:40:45.590 --> 04:40:45.600 align:start position:0%
Commission in an Earnest struggle to
 
04:40:47.628 --> 04:40:47.638 align:start position:0%
figure out what the legislature expects
 
04:40:47.638 --> 04:40:49.070 align:start position:0%
figure out what the legislature expects
of

04:40:49.070 --> 04:40:49.080 align:start position:0%
of
 
04:40:51.270 --> 04:40:51.280 align:start position:0%
it okay thank
 
04:40:55.390 --> 04:40:55.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:57.430 --> 04:40:57.440 align:start position:0%
questions okay seeing none I want to
 
04:41:00.708 --> 04:41:00.718 align:start position:0%
thank you for delivering your testimony
 
04:41:02.708 --> 04:41:02.718 align:start position:0%
on this Bill thank you Mr chairman
 
04:41:04.750 --> 04:41:04.760 align:start position:0%
you're very
 
04:41:07.788 --> 04:41:07.798 align:start position:0%
welcome next I would like to call the
 
04:41:10.948 --> 04:41:10.958 align:start position:0%
Public Utilities Commission Alex Bell
 
04:41:15.750 --> 04:41:15.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:18.590 --> 04:41:18.600 align:start position:0%
goldner Mr chairman uh chairman goldner
 
04:41:20.910 --> 04:41:20.920 align:start position:0%
may make some remarks after commissioner
 
04:41:23.868 --> 04:41:23.878 align:start position:0%
Delano if that is acceptable but that'll
 
04:41:25.670 --> 04:41:25.680 align:start position:0%
be at we'll get to that bridge when we
 
04:41:30.230 --> 04:41:30.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:33.470 --> 04:41:33.480 align:start position:0%
okay good afternoon chairman Vose and
 
04:41:35.708 --> 04:41:35.718 align:start position:0%
honorable members of the committee um
 
04:41:37.590 --> 04:41:37.600 align:start position:0%
I'm Alexander spidel senior advisor at
 
04:41:40.070 --> 04:41:40.080 align:start position:0%
the commission and I have with me
 
04:41:42.150 --> 04:41:42.160 align:start position:0%
commissioner Delano I won't take up much
 
04:41:44.150 --> 04:41:44.160 align:start position:0%
time I will seed the floor to him very
 
04:41:46.750 --> 04:41:46.760 align:start position:0%
quickly um it's been voiced some
 
04:41:48.948 --> 04:41:48.958 align:start position:0%
feedback that sometimes we get a little
 
04:41:50.990 --> 04:41:51.000 align:start position:0%
technical in our testimony so I will be
 
04:41:54.390 --> 04:41:54.400 align:start position:0%
short into the point um the proposed
 
04:41:58.670 --> 04:41:58.680 align:start position:0%
Bill uh would really gut the public
 
04:42:00.430 --> 04:42:00.440 align:start position:0%
utilities commission's
 
04:42:02.628 --> 04:42:02.638 align:start position:0%
capabilities what it would do is it
 
04:42:04.948 --> 04:42:04.958 align:start position:0%
would remove all of the investigative
 
04:42:08.310 --> 04:42:08.320 align:start position:0%
authorities that we've maintained since
 
04:42:11.430 --> 04:42:11.440 align:start position:0%
1911 and our general supervisory power
 
04:42:13.270 --> 04:42:13.280 align:start position:0%
over Public Utilities that we've had
 
04:42:13.280 --> 04:42:14.708 align:start position:0%
over Public Utilities that we've had
since

04:42:14.708 --> 04:42:14.718 align:start position:0%
since
 
04:42:17.550 --> 04:42:17.560 align:start position:0%
1911 and that was the time let's get in
 
04:42:19.470 --> 04:42:19.480 align:start position:0%
the time machine that's when I believe
 
04:42:21.110 --> 04:42:21.120 align:start position:0%
President William Howard Taft was
 
04:42:23.750 --> 04:42:23.760 align:start position:0%
President just for a sense of
 
04:42:26.230 --> 04:42:26.240 align:start position:0%
perspective and so there's focus on the
 
04:42:28.110 --> 04:42:28.120 align:start position:0%
settlement provision which is
 
04:42:30.990 --> 04:42:31.000 align:start position:0%
interesting but if you read the Preamble
 
04:42:33.708 --> 04:42:33.718 align:start position:0%
and you read all the language here it
 
04:42:37.990 --> 04:42:38.000 align:start position:0%
basically tells the commission it cannot
 
04:42:40.470 --> 04:42:40.480 align:start position:0%
investigate it truly would be the blind
 
04:42:42.510 --> 04:42:42.520 align:start position:0%
scales of Justice in the sense that a
 
04:42:44.470 --> 04:42:44.480 align:start position:0%
even a court in the state of New
 
04:42:47.150 --> 04:42:47.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire does not have that position
 
04:42:49.830 --> 04:42:49.840 align:start position:0%
and furthermore as chairman goldner and
 
04:42:51.948 --> 04:42:51.958 align:start position:0%
our uh colleagues Commissioners and
 
04:42:54.350 --> 04:42:54.360 align:start position:0%
others have already described we are not
 
04:42:56.310 --> 04:42:56.320 align:start position:0%
a court we are creation of the
 
04:42:58.550 --> 04:42:58.560 align:start position:0%
legislature with the responsibility
 
04:43:00.310 --> 04:43:00.320 align:start position:0%
delegated by the legislature for the
 
04:43:01.510 --> 04:43:01.520 align:start position:0%
regulation of
 
04:43:03.708 --> 04:43:03.718 align:start position:0%
monopolies under the New Hampshire and
 
04:43:03.718 --> 04:43:04.750 align:start position:0%
monopolies under the New Hampshire and
US

04:43:04.750 --> 04:43:04.760 align:start position:0%
US
 
04:43:08.430 --> 04:43:08.440 align:start position:0%
constitutions so I would caution that
 
04:43:10.550 --> 04:43:10.560 align:start position:0%
this bill is a step in the wrong
 
04:43:10.560 --> 04:43:11.948 align:start position:0%
this bill is a step in the wrong
direction

04:43:11.948 --> 04:43:11.958 align:start position:0%
direction
 
04:43:14.788 --> 04:43:14.798 align:start position:0%
there are companion bills that also
 
04:43:16.628 --> 04:43:16.638 align:start position:0%
potentially uh downgrade the
 
04:43:18.110 --> 04:43:18.120 align:start position:0%
responsibility of the Department of
 
04:43:22.030 --> 04:43:22.040 align:start position:0%
energy to provide timely information to
 
04:43:24.628 --> 04:43:24.638 align:start position:0%
the commission uh I think commissioner
 
04:43:27.788 --> 04:43:27.798 align:start position:0%
delafon will touch on that so I will now
 
04:43:29.830 --> 04:43:29.840 align:start position:0%
seed the floor to commissioner Delano
 
04:43:29.840 --> 04:43:32.110 align:start position:0%
seed the floor to commissioner Delano
thank

04:43:32.110 --> 04:43:32.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:34.708 --> 04:43:34.718 align:start position:0%

four weeks uh I serve at the public as a

commissioner of the New Hampshire Public
 
04:43:49.070 --> 04:43:49.080 align:start position:0%
Utilities Commission I'm here today to
 
04:43:52.470 --> 04:43:52.480 align:start position:0%
testify in opposition to House Bill
 
04:43:54.910 --> 04:43:54.920 align:start position:0%
535 a bill requested by the office of
 
04:43:56.510 --> 04:43:56.520 align:start position:0%
the consumer Advocate relative to
 
04:43:58.150 --> 04:43:58.160 align:start position:0%
defining the role of the Public
 
04:44:00.230 --> 04:44:00.240 align:start position:0%
Utilities Commission one of the things
 
04:44:02.470 --> 04:44:02.480 align:start position:0%
I'd like to point out immediately about
 
04:44:05.310 --> 04:44:05.320 align:start position:0%
that is is that we have a sister agency
 
04:44:07.190 --> 04:44:07.200 align:start position:0%
that must appear before the Public
 
04:44:09.990 --> 04:44:10.000 align:start position:0%
Utilities Commission coming before you
 
04:44:11.590 --> 04:44:11.600 align:start position:0%
with legislation
 
04:44:14.590 --> 04:44:14.600 align:start position:0%
that would actually change the way the
 
04:44:16.430 --> 04:44:16.440 align:start position:0%
organization that he must appear before
 
04:44:20.270 --> 04:44:20.280 align:start position:0%
and present a case before has to
 
04:44:22.750 --> 04:44:22.760 align:start position:0%

worked for one of its subsidiaries

uh at one of New Hampshire's now
 
04:46:38.548 --> 04:46:38.558 align:start position:0%
shuttered biomass power plants it's fair
 
04:46:40.270 --> 04:46:40.280 align:start position:0%
to say that I've been in and around
 
04:46:48.350 --> 04:46:48.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:51.030 --> 04:46:51.040 align:start position:0%
years turning to my testimony in
 
04:46:53.750 --> 04:46:53.760 align:start position:0%
opposition to House Bill 535 I'm
 
04:46:56.070 --> 04:46:56.080 align:start position:0%
troubled by the bill for several reasons
 
04:46:57.868 --> 04:46:57.878 align:start position:0%
but in the interest of time I'll Focus
 
04:47:00.070 --> 04:47:00.080 align:start position:0%
only on my top three reasons why the
 
04:47:01.868 --> 04:47:01.878 align:start position:0%
honorable members of this committee
 
04:47:04.470 --> 04:47:04.480 align:start position:0%
should find it inexpedient to legislate
 
04:47:06.750 --> 04:47:06.760 align:start position:0%
firstly for reasons left unarticulated
 
04:47:09.830 --> 04:47:09.840 align:start position:0%
by the consumer
 
04:47:12.190 --> 04:47:12.200 align:start position:0%
advocate it appears that without
 
04:47:14.868 --> 04:47:14.878 align:start position:0%
reasonable cause he would like the
 
04:47:16.708 --> 04:47:16.718 align:start position:0%
Public Utilities Commission an
 
04:47:18.070 --> 04:47:18.080 align:start position:0%
independent institution that
 
04:47:20.430 --> 04:47:20.440 align:start position:0%
successfully regulate and supervis the
 
04:47:23.070 --> 04:47:23.080 align:start position:0%
state's Public Utilities since at least
 
04:47:25.830 --> 04:47:25.840 align:start position:0%
1911 to no longer have a role in the
 
04:47:28.470 --> 04:47:28.480 align:start position:0%
supervision of the state's Public
 
04:47:31.270 --> 04:47:31.280 align:start position:0%
Utilities if you look at paragraph two
 
04:47:33.990 --> 04:47:34.000 align:start position:0%
of the proposed legislation it's clear
 
04:47:34.000 --> 04:47:36.070 align:start position:0%
of the proposed legislation it's clear
there

04:47:36.070 --> 04:47:36.080 align:start position:0%
there
 
04:47:39.470 --> 04:47:39.480 align:start position:0%
that the authority that the consumer
 
04:47:42.030 --> 04:47:42.040 align:start position:0%
Advocate suggest just should be stripped
 
04:47:44.070 --> 04:47:44.080 align:start position:0%
from the Public Utility Commission goes
 
04:47:46.708 --> 04:47:46.718 align:start position:0%
to the very core of what it
 
04:47:49.350 --> 04:47:49.360 align:start position:0%
does such a change to the Comm to the
 
04:47:49.360 --> 04:47:52.230 align:start position:0%
does such a change to the Comm to the
commission's

04:47:52.230 --> 04:47:52.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:54.310 --> 04:47:54.320 align:start position:0%
authority would result in a wide
 
04:47:56.230 --> 04:47:56.240 align:start position:0%
departure from the legislatur clearly
 
04:47:58.150 --> 04:47:58.160 align:start position:0%
expressed intent of establishing the
 
04:48:00.390 --> 04:48:00.400 align:start position:0%
commission is found by the the New
 
04:48:01.990 --> 04:48:02.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Supreme Court to provide
 
04:48:04.390 --> 04:48:04.400 align:start position:0%
comprehensive oversight for establishing
 
04:48:08.070 --> 04:48:08.080 align:start position:0%
and controlling Public Utilities in this
 
04:48:10.750 --> 04:48:10.760 align:start position:0%
state secondly the bill attempts to unre
 
04:48:12.390 --> 04:48:12.400 align:start position:0%
reasonably flipped the burden of proof
 
04:48:14.590 --> 04:48:14.600 align:start position:0%
for settlement agreements brought before
 
04:48:17.350 --> 04:48:17.360 align:start position:0%
the Public Utilities Commission in an
 
04:48:19.310 --> 04:48:19.320 align:start position:0%
adjudicative in an adjudicative
 
04:48:21.788 --> 04:48:21.798 align:start position:0%
proceeding from being on the parties to
 
04:48:23.910 --> 04:48:23.920 align:start position:0%
demonstrate to the commission that the
 
04:48:26.070 --> 04:48:26.080 align:start position:0%
proposed settlement agreement is
 
04:48:28.548 --> 04:48:28.558 align:start position:0%
consistent with applicable law is just
 
04:48:31.350 --> 04:48:31.360 align:start position:0%
and reasonable and serves the public
 
04:48:34.030 --> 04:48:34.040 align:start position:0%
interest instead the consumer Advocate
 
04:48:35.670 --> 04:48:35.680 align:start position:0%
wants to put that burden on to the
 
04:48:37.990 --> 04:48:38.000 align:start position:0%
Public Utilities Commission to find that
 
04:48:39.868 --> 04:48:39.878 align:start position:0%
any settlement provision is contrary to
 
04:48:43.750 --> 04:48:43.760 align:start position:0%
law put another way as presently drafted
 
04:48:48.150 --> 04:48:48.160 align:start position:0%
subparagraph 5 lines uh 23- 26 of
 
04:48:50.788 --> 04:48:50.798 align:start position:0%
paragraph 2 creates a presumption that
 
04:48:53.230 --> 04:48:53.240 align:start position:0%
any settlement agreement signed by in
 
04:48:55.788 --> 04:48:55.798 align:start position:0%
particular the the department of energy
 
04:48:58.310 --> 04:48:58.320 align:start position:0%
and the consumer Advocate uh is
 
04:49:00.310 --> 04:49:00.320 align:start position:0%
consistent with applicable law is just
 
04:49:02.350 --> 04:49:02.360 align:start position:0%
and reasonable and serves the public
 
04:49:04.670 --> 04:49:04.680 align:start position:0%
interest and therefore must be approved
 
04:49:06.590 --> 04:49:06.600 align:start position:0%
by the Public Utilities Commission
 
04:49:09.230 --> 04:49:09.240 align:start position:0%
unless the commission determines after a
 
04:49:11.548 --> 04:49:11.558 align:start position:0%
hearing that any settlement provision is
 
04:49:14.910 --> 04:49:14.920 align:start position:0%
contrary to law the flaw in that
 
04:49:17.430 --> 04:49:17.440 align:start position:0%
statutory construction however is that
 
04:49:19.750 --> 04:49:19.760 align:start position:0%
since all of the the commission's trial
 
04:49:21.670 --> 04:49:21.680 align:start position:0%
staff were transferred to the Department
 
04:49:24.350 --> 04:49:24.360 align:start position:0%
of energy three years ago no one is left
 
04:49:26.390 --> 04:49:26.400 align:start position:0%
to present evidence on the record to the
 
04:49:28.910 --> 04:49:28.920 align:start position:0%
commission that any settlement provision
 
04:49:30.670 --> 04:49:30.680 align:start position:0%
of a proposed settlement agreement
 
04:49:32.270 --> 04:49:32.280 align:start position:0%
signed by the department of energy the
 
04:49:34.390 --> 04:49:34.400 align:start position:0%
consumer Advocate Andor all the
 
04:49:38.070 --> 04:49:38.080 align:start position:0%
interveners is contrary to
 
04:49:41.230 --> 04:49:41.240 align:start position:0%
law this problem is only magnified by
 
04:49:42.990 --> 04:49:43.000 align:start position:0%
the apparent plan to strip the Public
 
04:49:45.190 --> 04:49:45.200 align:start position:0%
Utilities Commission of any authority to
 
04:49:46.868 --> 04:49:46.878 align:start position:0%
develop a record by which the commission
 
04:49:48.350 --> 04:49:48.360 align:start position:0%
can determine whether a settlement
 
04:49:50.510 --> 04:49:50.520 align:start position:0%
agreement is contrary to Law Without
 
04:49:52.910 --> 04:49:52.920 align:start position:0%
Reliance on the investigative resources
 
04:49:55.470 --> 04:49:55.480 align:start position:0%
of the Department of energy which I'll
 
04:49:57.670 --> 04:49:57.680 align:start position:0%
remind you is a party to the settlement
 
04:50:00.788 --> 04:50:00.798 align:start position:0%
agreement in those
 
04:50:03.190 --> 04:50:03.200 align:start position:0%
cases public utility commission's
 
04:50:05.430 --> 04:50:05.440 align:start position:0%
organization is actually based on the
 
04:50:07.830 --> 04:50:07.840 align:start position:0%
Federal Energy Regulatory commission's
 
04:50:11.030 --> 04:50:11.040 align:start position:0%
organization uh which presently under
 
04:50:13.110 --> 04:50:13.120 align:start position:0%
current federal law is not required to
 
04:50:14.750 --> 04:50:14.760 align:start position:0%
accept a proposed settlement agreement
 
04:50:16.030 --> 04:50:16.040 align:start position:0%
just because the parties of the case
 
04:50:18.390 --> 04:50:18.400 align:start position:0%
have agreed to it instead like the
 
04:50:19.948 --> 04:50:19.958 align:start position:0%
authority of the Public Utilities
 
04:50:23.030 --> 04:50:23.040 align:start position:0%
Commission presently the FK must still
 
04:50:25.230 --> 04:50:25.240 align:start position:0%
find based on the party's proferred
 
04:50:27.190 --> 04:50:27.200 align:start position:0%
evidence that a settlement agreement is
 
04:50:30.030 --> 04:50:30.040 align:start position:0%
just reasonable and in the public
 
04:50:32.708 --> 04:50:32.718 align:start position:0%
interest lastly and this goes more to
 
04:50:35.788 --> 04:50:35.798 align:start position:0%
the core of uh just an observation that
 
04:50:38.670 --> 04:50:38.680 align:start position:0%
I have as someone that has advised state
 
04:50:40.990 --> 04:50:41.000 align:start position:0%
agencies when I was at doj I had advised
 
04:50:43.868 --> 04:50:43.878 align:start position:0%
and represented 13 separate State
 
04:50:46.830 --> 04:50:46.840 align:start position:0%
agencies a state agency should not
 
04:50:48.670 --> 04:50:48.680 align:start position:0%
actively work to diminish the authority
 
04:50:50.750 --> 04:50:50.760 align:start position:0%
of its sister
 
04:50:53.070 --> 04:50:53.080 align:start position:0%
agencies even more outrageous than a
 
04:50:54.910 --> 04:50:54.920 align:start position:0%
dispute between state agencies are
 
04:50:56.548 --> 04:50:56.558 align:start position:0%
circumstances where is here a state
 
04:50:58.390 --> 04:50:58.400 align:start position:0%
agency that must appear before a sister
 
04:51:00.510 --> 04:51:00.520 align:start position:0%
agency to exercise its own statutory
 
04:51:02.788 --> 04:51:02.798 align:start position:0%
purpose actually works to reduce that
 
04:51:05.110 --> 04:51:05.120 align:start position:0%
agency's authority to accomplish goals
 
04:51:06.948 --> 04:51:06.958 align:start position:0%
that may or may not be outside of its
 
04:51:09.990 --> 04:51:10.000 align:start position:0%
statutory purpose I have the utmost and
 
04:51:12.270 --> 04:51:12.280 align:start position:0%
I mean this utmost respect for the
 
04:51:15.030 --> 04:51:15.040 align:start position:0%
consumer Advocate nevertheless any
 
04:51:16.788 --> 04:51:16.798 align:start position:0%
efforts to diminish the public UT
 
04:51:18.750 --> 04:51:18.760 align:start position:0%
Utilities Commission are wrong-headed
 
04:51:20.430 --> 04:51:20.440 align:start position:0%
and serve only to weaken the state's
 
04:51:22.990 --> 04:51:23.000 align:start position:0%
regulatory oversight of its Public
 
04:51:24.948 --> 04:51:24.958 align:start position:0%
Utilities thank you I'm available for
 
04:51:24.958 --> 04:51:29.830 align:start position:0%
Utilities thank you I'm available for
any

04:51:29.830 --> 04:51:29.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:32.750 --> 04:51:32.760 align:start position:0%
questions okay thank you you presented a
 
04:51:35.830 --> 04:51:35.840 align:start position:0%
lot of information there so I had to um
 
04:51:38.350 --> 04:51:38.360 align:start position:0%
uh do a lot of note taking slowed me
 
04:51:40.910 --> 04:51:40.920 align:start position:0%
down a bit so Representatives johs son
 
04:51:42.548 --> 04:51:42.558 align:start position:0%
has his hand up but since he introduced
 
04:51:44.948 --> 04:51:44.958 align:start position:0%
this bill he can't actually ask a
 
04:51:47.948 --> 04:51:47.958 align:start position:0%
question um but we have other
 
04:51:50.030 --> 04:51:50.040 align:start position:0%
questioners here so we'll start with
 
04:51:50.040 --> 04:51:51.190 align:start position:0%
questioners here so we'll start with
representative

04:51:51.190 --> 04:51:51.200 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:51:53.548 --> 04:51:53.558 align:start position:0%
McGee thank you Mr chair and I realize
 
04:51:55.628 --> 04:51:55.638 align:start position:0%
you called on me because my committee
 
04:51:57.350 --> 04:51:57.360 align:start position:0%
members my fellow committee members keep
 
04:51:59.430 --> 04:51:59.440 align:start position:0%
deferring to me and we all go off at
 
04:52:01.868 --> 04:52:01.878 align:start position:0%
once okay so I have a question for each
 
04:52:05.750 --> 04:52:05.760 align:start position:0%
of you I'll start with you Mr spidel um
 
04:52:08.670 --> 04:52:08.680 align:start position:0%
how many people did you have in the
 
04:52:10.510 --> 04:52:10.520 align:start position:0%
Public Utilities Commission before the
 
04:52:14.230 --> 04:52:14.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:16.750 --> 04:52:16.760 align:start position:0%
2021 I wasn't at the Public Utilities
 
04:52:19.788 --> 04:52:19.798 align:start position:0%
Commission for about roughly three and a
 
04:52:22.628 --> 04:52:22.638 align:start position:0%
half year Gap from 2018 when chairman
 
04:52:25.670 --> 04:52:25.680 align:start position:0%
honberg was the chairman until February
 
04:52:28.470 --> 04:52:28.480 align:start position:0%
of 2022 that's when I came back so the
 
04:52:31.310 --> 04:52:31.320 align:start position:0%
split happened after my departure my
 
04:52:33.430 --> 04:52:33.440 align:start position:0%
understanding was at the Staffing level
 
04:52:36.470 --> 04:52:36.480 align:start position:0%
from the time of chairman honberg
 
04:52:38.150 --> 04:52:38.160 align:start position:0%
through the time of chairman Martin and
 
04:52:41.270 --> 04:52:41.280 align:start position:0%
the split in 21 was stable at about 75
 
04:52:43.470 --> 04:52:43.480 align:start position:0%
personnel and how many do you have now
 
04:52:46.110 --> 04:52:46.120 align:start position:0%
just so we can have a 12 line personnel
 
04:52:49.590 --> 04:52:49.600 align:start position:0%
and three Commissioners okay thank
 
04:52:53.628 --> 04:52:53.638 align:start position:0%
you um and then okay followup oh yes
 
04:52:54.948 --> 04:52:54.958 align:start position:0%
followup I said I had a question for
 
04:52:56.470 --> 04:52:56.480 align:start position:0%
each of them so I was just going to
 
04:53:01.788 --> 04:53:01.798 align:start position:0%
thank you um so Mr orano uh Del orano
 
04:53:03.948 --> 04:53:03.958 align:start position:0%
Del orano I'm sorry okay there was a
 
04:53:07.430 --> 04:53:07.440 align:start position:0%
former commissioner Oro right okay I'm
 
04:53:10.548 --> 04:53:10.558 align:start position:0%
projecting um my question was I I I
 
04:53:13.670 --> 04:53:13.680 align:start position:0%
heard you say that
 
04:53:16.670 --> 04:53:16.680 align:start position:0%
um that you thought it wouldn't be a
 
04:53:19.750 --> 04:53:19.760 align:start position:0%
good idea to require that the Public
 
04:53:22.868 --> 04:53:22.878 align:start position:0%
Utilities Commission had to approve a
 
04:53:25.590 --> 04:53:25.600 align:start position:0%
settlement um that was agreed to by all
 
04:53:26.590 --> 04:53:26.600 align:start position:0%
of the
 
04:53:30.548 --> 04:53:30.558 align:start position:0%
parties um unless it uh was contrary to
 
04:53:34.708 --> 04:53:34.718 align:start position:0%
law but the law already includes the
 
04:53:36.948 --> 04:53:36.958 align:start position:0%
language of Justin reasonable so you
 
04:53:40.470 --> 04:53:40.480 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be prohibited from finding a
 
04:53:42.150 --> 04:53:42.160 align:start position:0%
case not just in reasonable and using
 
04:53:45.030 --> 04:53:45.040 align:start position:0%
that as an as an exemption so I'm just
 
04:53:47.868 --> 04:53:47.878 align:start position:0%
trying to figure out why you put that
 
04:53:49.430 --> 04:53:49.440 align:start position:0%
out there because it it doesn't seem
 
04:53:51.948 --> 04:53:51.958 align:start position:0%
like the bill takes that away from you
 
04:53:54.110 --> 04:53:54.120 align:start position:0%
it basically says if it's in the law
 
04:53:55.910 --> 04:53:55.920 align:start position:0%
which just and reasonable is in the law
 
04:53:58.070 --> 04:53:58.080 align:start position:0%
that language is in the current law then
 
04:54:00.510 --> 04:54:00.520 align:start position:0%
you would have that you would have that
 
04:54:00.520 --> 04:54:02.030 align:start position:0%
you would have that you would have that
Latitude

04:54:02.030 --> 04:54:02.040 align:start position:0%
Latitude
 
04:54:04.628 --> 04:54:04.638 align:start position:0%
right I think the issue is is that when
 
04:54:06.910 --> 04:54:06.920 align:start position:0%
you have all of the parties to the to
 
04:54:08.548 --> 04:54:08.558 align:start position:0%
the case coming forward with the
 
04:54:10.510 --> 04:54:10.520 align:start position:0%
settlement agreement there's no one left
 
04:54:12.990 --> 04:54:13.000 align:start position:0%
to present why there might be an issue
 
04:54:15.030 --> 04:54:15.040 align:start position:0%
that's contrary to law since we no
 
04:54:17.430 --> 04:54:17.440 align:start position:0%
longer have trial staff we can't determ
 
04:54:19.670 --> 04:54:19.680 align:start position:0%
we can't develop a record around that
 
04:54:21.548 --> 04:54:21.558 align:start position:0%
somebody would need to present that to
 
04:54:25.628 --> 04:54:25.638 align:start position:0%
us and given the way that this bill is
 
04:54:28.470 --> 04:54:28.480 align:start position:0%
written we would be left with accepting
 
04:54:31.788 --> 04:54:31.798 align:start position:0%
whatever it was that uh the consumer
 
04:54:34.110 --> 04:54:34.120 align:start position:0%
Advocate the department of energy and
 
04:54:37.070 --> 04:54:37.080 align:start position:0%
the intervening parties would present so
 
04:54:39.470 --> 04:54:39.480 align:start position:0%
even if it was contrary to law how are
 
04:54:42.110 --> 04:54:42.120 align:start position:0%
we supposed to get that into the record
 
04:54:44.510 --> 04:54:44.520 align:start position:0%
if we have no ability to investigate any
 
04:54:46.590 --> 04:54:46.600 align:start position:0%
longer and we have no trial staff to
 
04:54:48.750 --> 04:54:48.760 align:start position:0%
present a case that could potentially
 
04:54:51.230 --> 04:54:51.240 align:start position:0%
show that it's contrary to law uh I
 
04:54:53.270 --> 04:54:53.280 align:start position:0%
would obviously welcome one of my
 
04:54:55.350 --> 04:54:55.360 align:start position:0%
Assistant Attorney General friends from
 
04:54:56.990 --> 04:54:57.000 align:start position:0%
the Department of Justice to come over
 
04:55:00.070 --> 04:55:00.080 align:start position:0%
and do that but uh presently uh that
 
04:55:05.430 --> 04:55:05.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:09.310 --> 04:55:09.320 align:start position:0%
scheme I thought I thought that was a
 
04:55:12.510 --> 04:55:12.520 align:start position:0%
followup follow all right I'll allow
 
04:55:14.510 --> 04:55:14.520 align:start position:0%
this one more followup thank you it
 
04:55:16.150 --> 04:55:16.160 align:start position:0%
gives everybody more time to formulate
 
04:55:19.750 --> 04:55:19.760 align:start position:0%
their questions anyway um so the the
 
04:55:21.030 --> 04:55:21.040 align:start position:0%
question that I had about what you just
 
04:55:23.390 --> 04:55:23.400 align:start position:0%
said was that you don't have the time
 
04:55:24.750 --> 04:55:24.760 align:start position:0%
you know you wouldn't have the
 
04:55:27.070 --> 04:55:27.080 align:start position:0%
opportunity to develop that own
 
04:55:28.830 --> 04:55:28.840 align:start position:0%
investigation but do you have staff to
 
04:55:31.070 --> 04:55:31.080 align:start position:0%
do that even if you H you were if if it
 
04:55:33.788 --> 04:55:33.798 align:start position:0%
was in your purview how would you
 
04:55:36.510 --> 04:55:36.520 align:start position:0%
accomplish that because you just I just
 
04:55:38.868 --> 04:55:38.878 align:start position:0%
heard that you don't have the staff so
 
04:55:41.390 --> 04:55:41.400 align:start position:0%
so presently the the commission has the
 
04:55:43.270 --> 04:55:43.280 align:start position:0%
ability to make record requests of the
 
04:55:45.750 --> 04:55:45.760 align:start position:0%
utilities the department of energy and
 
04:55:48.470 --> 04:55:48.480 align:start position:0%
the consumer Advocate my reading of this
 
04:55:50.948 --> 04:55:50.958 align:start position:0%
bill would eliminate that Authority so
 
04:55:52.868 --> 04:55:52.878 align:start position:0%
if there are issues that are confusing
 
04:55:54.350 --> 04:55:54.360 align:start position:0%
to the commission or the commission
 
04:55:56.390 --> 04:55:56.400 align:start position:0%
would like more clarity on they can make
 
04:55:58.750 --> 04:55:58.760 align:start position:0%
what's called a record request to as I
 
04:56:00.270 --> 04:56:00.280 align:start position:0%
mentioned the utility the consumer
 
04:56:02.030 --> 04:56:02.040 align:start position:0%
Advocate Department of energy or any of
 
04:56:04.350 --> 04:56:04.360 align:start position:0%
the interveners and that party would
 
04:56:06.070 --> 04:56:06.080 align:start position:0%
then present that evidence through that
 
04:56:08.670 --> 04:56:08.680 align:start position:0%
the response to that uh that record
 
04:56:11.628 --> 04:56:11.638 align:start position:0%
request this bill would eliminate in my
 
04:56:14.470 --> 04:56:14.480 align:start position:0%
opinion that that
 
04:56:17.390 --> 04:56:17.400 align:start position:0%
ability okay additional questions
 
04:56:19.510 --> 04:56:19.520 align:start position:0%
representative Kaplan has
 
04:56:21.910 --> 04:56:21.920 align:start position:0%
one thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
04:56:23.628 --> 04:56:23.638 align:start position:0%
gentlemen uh this might be a related
 
04:56:25.628 --> 04:56:25.638 align:start position:0%
question but just help me to understand
 
04:56:27.470 --> 04:56:27.480 align:start position:0%
your objection to having the
 
04:56:29.390 --> 04:56:29.400 align:start position:0%
investigatory uh capabilities being
 
04:56:32.628 --> 04:56:32.638 align:start position:0%
placed in the department of energy um
 
04:56:34.030 --> 04:56:34.040 align:start position:0%
there is a there's a settle there's a
 
04:56:35.948 --> 04:56:35.958 align:start position:0%
negotiating process parties go before
 
04:56:37.750 --> 04:56:37.760 align:start position:0%
the department of energy they go before
 
04:56:39.430 --> 04:56:39.440 align:start position:0%
the uh the consumer Advocate they reach
 
04:56:40.910 --> 04:56:40.920 align:start position:0%
a settlement
 
04:56:43.590 --> 04:56:43.600 align:start position:0%
they come to you and you want to
 
04:56:45.150 --> 04:56:45.160 align:start position:0%
investigate you go back to the
 
04:56:47.830 --> 04:56:47.840 align:start position:0%
Department of energy to do that
 
04:56:49.990 --> 04:56:50.000 align:start position:0%
investigation isn't that isn't that
 
04:56:52.150 --> 04:56:52.160 align:start position:0%
redundant somehow I mean to to a lay
 
04:56:55.708 --> 04:56:55.718 align:start position:0%
person that might seem like a you know
 
04:56:58.510 --> 04:56:58.520 align:start position:0%
an inefficiency in the process so can
 
04:57:00.830 --> 04:57:00.840 align:start position:0%
you explain so so first off I have
 
04:57:02.750 --> 04:57:02.760 align:start position:0%
absolutely no issue with the
 
04:57:04.788 --> 04:57:04.798 align:start position:0%
investigatory Authority being vested in
 
04:57:07.590 --> 04:57:07.600 align:start position:0%
the department of energy that is where
 
04:57:09.548 --> 04:57:09.558 align:start position:0%
the legislature has placed it and I have
 
04:57:12.230 --> 04:57:12.240 align:start position:0%
absolutely no issue with it but what the
 
04:57:14.390 --> 04:57:14.400 align:start position:0%
current Authority allows is it allows
 
04:57:16.670 --> 04:57:16.680 align:start position:0%
for the Public Utilities Commission to
 
04:57:20.270 --> 04:57:20.280 align:start position:0%
continue to uh explore issues that may
 
04:57:22.390 --> 04:57:22.400 align:start position:0%
be presented before the commission
 
04:57:24.868 --> 04:57:24.878 align:start position:0%
through record requests and that would
 
04:57:27.470 --> 04:57:27.480 align:start position:0%
disappear if this were taken
 
04:57:29.868 --> 04:57:29.878 align:start position:0%
away did does that address your question
 
04:57:33.430 --> 04:57:33.440 align:start position:0%
sir so it it's it's it's just follow
 
04:57:34.948 --> 04:57:34.958 align:start position:0%
followup question so it's strictly a
 
04:57:36.948 --> 04:57:36.958 align:start position:0%
matter of a record request that you that
 
04:57:39.708 --> 04:57:39.718 align:start position:0%
you to there are a few other elements
 
04:57:41.868 --> 04:57:41.878 align:start position:0%
around that but it's primarily the the
 
04:57:45.868 --> 04:57:45.878 align:start position:0%
record requests that would uh not be
 
04:57:47.430 --> 04:57:47.440 align:start position:0%
allowed anymore the other the other
 
04:57:48.910 --> 04:57:48.920 align:start position:0%
point and and then I'm going to address
 
04:57:50.190 --> 04:57:50.200 align:start position:0%
the second point that you brought up
 
04:57:53.150 --> 04:57:53.160 align:start position:0%
around the uh the the consumer Advocate
 
04:57:54.708 --> 04:57:54.718 align:start position:0%
the department of energy and the
 
04:57:56.990 --> 04:57:57.000 align:start position:0%
interveners getting together to uh
 
04:57:58.788 --> 04:57:58.798 align:start position:0%
negotiate a settlement then presenting
 
04:58:00.990 --> 04:58:01.000 align:start position:0%
it to the the Public Utilities
 
04:58:03.150 --> 04:58:03.160 align:start position:0%
Commission the the Public Utilities
 
04:58:06.190 --> 04:58:06.200 align:start position:0%
Commission has unlike a court has
 
04:58:09.750 --> 04:58:09.760 align:start position:0%
independent uh statutory duties around
 
04:58:11.708 --> 04:58:11.718 align:start position:0%
deter determining whether or not rates
 
04:58:13.470 --> 04:58:13.480 align:start position:0%
are just reasonable and in the public
 
04:58:18.628 --> 04:58:18.638 align:start position:0%
interest so if the department of energy
 
04:58:20.350 --> 04:58:20.360 align:start position:0%
and the consumer Advocate and the and
 
04:58:22.590 --> 04:58:22.600 align:start position:0%
the associated interveners all kind of
 
04:58:25.708 --> 04:58:25.718 align:start position:0%
agreed that that's the case and the
 
04:58:27.830 --> 04:58:27.840 align:start position:0%
Public Utilities Commission is now just
 
04:58:30.708 --> 04:58:30.718 align:start position:0%
left in the position of rubber stamping
 
04:58:33.910 --> 04:58:33.920 align:start position:0%
that agreement among them then how do we
 
04:58:37.510 --> 04:58:37.520 align:start position:0%
meet our statutory duties we can't meet
 
04:58:40.670 --> 04:58:40.680 align:start position:0%
them under that situation so
 
04:58:43.670 --> 04:58:43.680 align:start position:0%
how do we reconcile the fact that we
 
04:58:45.110 --> 04:58:45.120 align:start position:0%
have an independent obligation to make
 
04:58:48.150 --> 04:58:48.160 align:start position:0%
sure these rates are proper but without
 
04:58:49.830 --> 04:58:49.840 align:start position:0%
the ability to do that because we're
 
04:58:51.590 --> 04:58:51.600 align:start position:0%
completely dependent on whatever comes
 
04:58:55.070 --> 04:58:55.080 align:start position:0%
forward and we have no ability in this
 
04:58:58.470 --> 04:58:58.480 align:start position:0%
situation to have anyone come forward
 
04:59:00.868 --> 04:59:00.878 align:start position:0%
with information that might be contrary
 
04:59:00.878 --> 04:59:01.948 align:start position:0%
with information that might be contrary
to

04:59:01.948 --> 04:59:01.958 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:59:04.390 --> 04:59:04.400 align:start position:0%
law I don't understand how this works
 
04:59:07.030 --> 04:59:07.040 align:start position:0%
and allows us to continue to uh exercise
 
04:59:11.470 --> 04:59:11.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:13.788 --> 04:59:13.798 align:start position:0%
Vice chair Thomas has a question thank
 
04:59:15.390 --> 04:59:15.400 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman and thank you for taking
 
04:59:20.708 --> 04:59:20.718 align:start position:0%
my question would you clarify for us how
 
04:59:24.750 --> 04:59:24.760 align:start position:0%
the contents of this bill would or would
 
04:59:29.430 --> 04:59:29.440 align:start position:0%
not uh fix the three major concerns that
 
04:59:32.270 --> 04:59:32.280 align:start position:0%
the OCA brought forward in his testimony
 
04:59:35.350 --> 04:59:35.360 align:start position:0%
that seem to be the the Crux of his um
 
04:59:36.990 --> 04:59:37.000 align:start position:0%
testimony frankly I don't think it
 
04:59:41.548 --> 04:59:41.558 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:44.990 --> 04:59:45.000 align:start position:0%
I followup followup U obvious followup
 
04:59:47.190 --> 04:59:47.200 align:start position:0%
is could you explain why sure so one of
 
04:59:49.510 --> 04:59:49.520 align:start position:0%
the issues that that uh the consumer
 
04:59:51.430 --> 04:59:51.440 align:start position:0%
Advocate brought up was cost cost of
 
04:59:51.440 --> 04:59:52.350 align:start position:0%
Advocate brought up was cost cost of
these

04:59:52.350 --> 04:59:52.360 align:start position:0%
these
 
04:59:54.628 --> 04:59:54.638 align:start position:0%
proceedings the the I think the trouble
 
04:59:56.270 --> 04:59:56.280 align:start position:0%
is is that you're still going to have 40
 
04:59:58.110 --> 04:59:58.120 align:start position:0%
lawyers in the room you're still going
 
05:00:00.150 --> 05:00:00.160 align:start position:0%
to have uh you're still going to have
 
05:00:01.510 --> 05:00:01.520 align:start position:0%
the consumer Advocate there you're still
 
05:00:02.708 --> 05:00:02.718 align:start position:0%
going to have the department of energy
 
05:00:03.708 --> 05:00:03.718 align:start position:0%
there you're going to have the the
 
05:00:05.510 --> 05:00:05.520 align:start position:0%
commission staff your excuse me not
 
05:00:07.390 --> 05:00:07.400 align:start position:0%
commission staff but the Commissioners
 
05:00:11.708 --> 05:00:11.718 align:start position:0%
there so it doesn't really change the
 
05:00:15.628 --> 05:00:15.638 align:start position:0%
cost of proceedings what it may do is it
 
05:00:17.510 --> 05:00:17.520 align:start position:0%
may encourage people to come forward
 
05:00:19.310 --> 05:00:19.320 align:start position:0%
with a settlement agreement but that
 
05:00:21.590 --> 05:00:21.600 align:start position:0%
settlement agreement may not ultimately
 
05:00:23.990 --> 05:00:24.000 align:start position:0%
be what's in the best interests of both
 
05:00:27.350 --> 05:00:27.360 align:start position:0%
the utility and the rate base because
 
05:00:29.190 --> 05:00:29.200 align:start position:0%
there's a careful balancing act that the
 
05:00:31.670 --> 05:00:31.680 align:start position:0%
Public Utilities Commission must perform
 
05:00:34.110 --> 05:00:34.120 align:start position:0%
when it's making those determinations it
 
05:00:37.070 --> 05:00:37.080 align:start position:0%
needs to determine and and find and
 
05:00:40.708 --> 05:00:40.718 align:start position:0%
allow for the
 
05:00:42.628 --> 05:00:42.638 align:start position:0%
the customers of the regulated public
 
05:00:45.750 --> 05:00:45.760 align:start position:0%
utility to pay the lowest rate possible
 
05:00:48.030 --> 05:00:48.040 align:start position:0%
while also facilitating a capital
 
05:00:51.270 --> 05:00:51.280 align:start position:0%
structure that allows the utility to
 
05:00:53.990 --> 05:00:54.000 align:start position:0%
operate there may be cases out there
 
05:00:56.350 --> 05:00:56.360 align:start position:0%
folks other than I should probably talk
 
05:00:58.190 --> 05:00:58.200 align:start position:0%
about them where that may or may not
 
05:01:00.430 --> 05:01:00.440 align:start position:0%
have been the case and so what I would
 
05:01:02.830 --> 05:01:02.840 align:start position:0%
what I would suggest is that while I
 
05:01:04.788 --> 05:01:04.798 align:start position:0%
think that the consumer Advocate put
 
05:01:06.868 --> 05:01:06.878 align:start position:0%
forward a good faith effort here to
 
05:01:09.270 --> 05:01:09.280 align:start position:0%
identify issues that he sees as
 
05:01:10.948 --> 05:01:10.958 align:start position:0%
problematic I don't think that that
 
05:01:13.548 --> 05:01:13.558 align:start position:0%
deals with the overall issue of cost
 
05:01:15.548 --> 05:01:15.558 align:start position:0%
these are costly proceedings and the
 
05:01:17.190 --> 05:01:17.200 align:start position:0%
reason why they're costly proceedings is
 
05:01:19.510 --> 05:01:19.520 align:start position:0%
because of the pricing power that the
 
05:01:22.590 --> 05:01:22.600 align:start position:0%
public utility has add to that the
 
05:01:25.948 --> 05:01:25.958 align:start position:0%
interests that many times uh appear and
 
05:01:27.830 --> 05:01:27.840 align:start position:0%
intervene in these proceedings with
 
05:01:30.788 --> 05:01:30.798 align:start position:0%
their own uh matters that they would
 
05:01:33.750 --> 05:01:33.760 align:start position:0%
like to see baked into rates it opens up
 
05:01:37.470 --> 05:01:37.480 align:start position:0%
the the proceedings to you know a a long
 
05:01:42.150 --> 05:01:42.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:43.670 --> 05:01:43.680 align:start position:0%
representative Wendy
 
05:01:46.470 --> 05:01:46.480 align:start position:0%
Thomas thank you Mr chair um and thank
 
05:01:49.750 --> 05:01:49.760 align:start position:0%
you for being here um you testified at
 
05:01:51.910 --> 05:01:51.920 align:start position:0%
some length about the unarticulated
 
05:01:54.868 --> 05:01:54.878 align:start position:0%
arguments by the uh or unarticulated
 
05:01:57.830 --> 05:01:57.840 align:start position:0%
facts by the consumer Advocate I'm
 
05:02:00.750 --> 05:02:00.760 align:start position:0%
wondering just how one does articulate
 
05:02:01.670 --> 05:02:01.680 align:start position:0%
what is
 
05:02:04.788 --> 05:02:04.798 align:start position:0%
unarticulated however my question is
 
05:02:06.830 --> 05:02:06.840 align:start position:0%
have you met to have any discussions
 
05:02:08.670 --> 05:02:08.680 align:start position:0%
directly about this bill with the
 
05:02:11.190 --> 05:02:11.200 align:start position:0%
consumer advocate
 
05:02:13.788 --> 05:02:13.798 align:start position:0%
he and I have discussed this this topic
 
05:02:15.670 --> 05:02:15.680 align:start position:0%
previously and and we just don't see eye
 
05:02:19.750 --> 05:02:19.760 align:start position:0%
to eye on it follow up follow up um and
 
05:02:21.750 --> 05:02:21.760 align:start position:0%

05:02:23.350 --> 05:02:23.360 align:start position:0%
background can you tell me how many of
 
05:02:25.510 --> 05:02:25.520 align:start position:0%
the other Commissioners have legal Andor
 
05:02:25.520 --> 05:02:26.510 align:start position:0%
the other Commissioners have legal Andor
law

05:02:26.510 --> 05:02:26.520 align:start position:0%
law
 
05:02:28.788 --> 05:02:28.798 align:start position:0%
backgrounds I don't I can't answer that
 
05:02:31.948 --> 05:02:31.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:36.070 --> 05:02:36.080 align:start position:0%
you okay seeing no further questions for
 
05:02:37.868 --> 05:02:37.878 align:start position:0%
the two of you I understand that
 
05:02:40.670 --> 05:02:40.680 align:start position:0%
chairman goldner would like to
 
05:02:45.470 --> 05:02:45.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:48.590 --> 05:02:48.600 align:start position:0%
or okay nothing further to add in that
 
05:02:51.948 --> 05:02:51.958 align:start position:0%
case we'll call forward the last uh
 
05:02:54.230 --> 05:02:54.240 align:start position:0%

written uh so you know to give you
 
05:03:36.350 --> 05:03:36.360 align:start position:0%
context on my background obviously some
 
05:03:38.510 --> 05:03:38.520 align:start position:0%
of you knew me uh in my previous role uh
 
05:03:40.390 --> 05:03:40.400 align:start position:0%
with the governor's office
 
05:03:41.750 --> 05:03:41.760 align:start position:0%
uh where I served as legislative
 
05:03:44.150 --> 05:03:44.160 align:start position:0%
director when this when this uh
 
05:03:45.430 --> 05:03:45.440 align:start position:0%
legislation was moving forward in the
 
05:03:49.948 --> 05:03:49.958 align:start position:0%
2021 budget um as we all might well for
 
05:03:51.110 --> 05:03:51.120 align:start position:0%
those of us who were there we might
 
05:03:52.948 --> 05:03:52.958 align:start position:0%
remember that this was a very big
 
05:03:55.750 --> 05:03:55.760 align:start position:0%
undertaking and it was happening pretty
 
05:03:59.310 --> 05:03:59.320 align:start position:0%
quickly and so as part of part of the uh
 
05:04:02.070 --> 05:04:02.080 align:start position:0%
H having this able to move forward uh
 
05:04:04.470 --> 05:04:04.480 align:start position:0%
the legislature in their wisdom built in
 
05:04:06.948 --> 05:04:06.958 align:start position:0%
a number of safeguards and overlapping
 
05:04:09.788 --> 05:04:09.798 align:start position:0%
jurisdictions to help ensure that
 
05:04:11.948 --> 05:04:11.958 align:start position:0%
regardless of how things turned out we
 
05:04:14.230 --> 05:04:14.240 align:start position:0%
were able to pick up the pieces wouldn't
 
05:04:15.470 --> 05:04:15.480 align:start position:0%
have Things fall through the cracks and
 
05:04:17.910 --> 05:04:17.920 align:start position:0%
we were able to support uh you know a a
 
05:04:20.708 --> 05:04:20.718 align:start position:0%
successful regulatory process here in in
 
05:04:23.910 --> 05:04:23.920 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire uh you know the department
 
05:04:26.390 --> 05:04:26.400 align:start position:0%
of energy was created in part to
 
05:04:28.708 --> 05:04:28.718 align:start position:0%
restructure uh the Pu with the intention
 
05:04:30.788 --> 05:04:30.798 align:start position:0%
of separating out the rate making
 
05:04:33.708 --> 05:04:33.718 align:start position:0%
functions and the um
 
05:04:36.190 --> 05:04:36.200 align:start position:0%
adjudication uh from the you know some
 
05:04:39.030 --> 05:04:39.040 align:start position:0%
of the other regulation the policy work
 
05:04:41.270 --> 05:04:41.280 align:start position:0%
the regulatory advocacy and and the
 
05:04:43.788 --> 05:04:43.798 align:start position:0%
programs that the department of energy
 
05:04:45.750 --> 05:04:45.760 align:start position:0%
uh was was given also
 
05:04:48.270 --> 05:04:48.280 align:start position:0%
enforcement and that was you know that
 
05:04:52.548 --> 05:04:52.558 align:start position:0%
was a big task right and so the the uh
 
05:04:54.350 --> 05:04:54.360 align:start position:0%
the overlapping jurisdictions that you
 
05:04:58.110 --> 05:04:58.120 align:start position:0%
built into place were successful right
 
05:04:59.750 --> 05:04:59.760 align:start position:0%
there was some bumpiness in the first
 
05:05:01.510 --> 05:05:01.520 align:start position:0%
couple of months but but really all in
 
05:05:04.430 --> 05:05:04.440 align:start position:0%
all we have been able to function and
 
05:05:06.470 --> 05:05:06.480 align:start position:0%
and and frankly we've we've fallen into
 
05:05:08.670 --> 05:05:08.680 align:start position:0%
a rhythm where I think we can you know
 
05:05:10.708 --> 05:05:10.718 align:start position:0%
keep working things out
 
05:05:12.788 --> 05:05:12.798 align:start position:0%
and uh you know that's not to say there
 
05:05:15.350 --> 05:05:15.360 align:start position:0%
aren't occasional disagreements I think
 
05:05:17.230 --> 05:05:17.240 align:start position:0%
among the state agencies as you'll as
 
05:05:19.510 --> 05:05:19.520 align:start position:0%
you've seen and as as I'm sure you're
 
05:05:22.590 --> 05:05:22.600 align:start position:0%
you're well aware of uh about what the
 
05:05:24.110 --> 05:05:24.120 align:start position:0%
proper role of the commission is and
 
05:05:25.670 --> 05:05:25.680 align:start position:0%
whether or not they are stretching the
 
05:05:28.190 --> 05:05:28.200 align:start position:0%
bounds of what the legislature intended
 
05:05:31.230 --> 05:05:31.240 align:start position:0%
for the commission back in 2021 and so I
 
05:05:32.430 --> 05:05:32.440 align:start position:0%
do think that this bill is
 
05:05:34.990 --> 05:05:35.000 align:start position:0%
well-intentioned in a purist kind of way
 
05:05:36.910 --> 05:05:36.920 align:start position:0%
you know the the the concept of sort of
 
05:05:40.590 --> 05:05:40.600 align:start position:0%
finishing the job uh to to remove the
 
05:05:42.830 --> 05:05:42.840 align:start position:0%
sort of the Temptation from the from the
 
05:05:44.190 --> 05:05:44.200 align:start position:0%
commission to go outside of their
 
05:05:47.270 --> 05:05:47.280 align:start position:0%
legislatively intended Lane but I do
 
05:05:49.628 --> 05:05:49.638 align:start position:0%
think that this bill as written is is
 
05:05:51.750 --> 05:05:51.760 align:start position:0%
heavy-handed and I think it guarantees
 
05:05:53.708 --> 05:05:53.718 align:start position:0%
that we're going to see more confusion
 
05:05:56.628 --> 05:05:56.638 align:start position:0%
not less um and and that honestly
 
05:05:58.990 --> 05:05:59.000 align:start position:0%
important issues have a pretty good
 
05:06:00.708 --> 05:06:00.718 align:start position:0%
likelihood of falling through the
 
05:06:03.310 --> 05:06:03.320 align:start position:0%
cracks um in it search for conceptual
 
05:06:05.430 --> 05:06:05.440 align:start position:0%
Purity uh it's going to disadvantage
 
05:06:07.750 --> 05:06:07.760 align:start position:0%
customers regulated utilities pretty
 
05:06:09.830 --> 05:06:09.840 align:start position:0%
significantly um I think it does try to
 
05:06:12.470 --> 05:06:12.480 align:start position:0%
answer what are you know genuinely you
 
05:06:15.470 --> 05:06:15.480 align:start position:0%
know not not non-existent but smaller
 
05:06:17.430 --> 05:06:17.440 align:start position:0%
problems with very consequential
 
05:06:20.390 --> 05:06:20.400 align:start position:0%
Solutions so obviously this pu uh
 
05:06:22.030 --> 05:06:22.040 align:start position:0%
Authority would would be reduced under
 
05:06:24.750 --> 05:06:24.760 align:start position:0%
this bill uh you know it would limit
 
05:06:26.670 --> 05:06:26.680 align:start position:0%
their authority to conduct adjudicative
 
05:06:28.868 --> 05:06:28.878 align:start position:0%
proceedings and adopting rules they no
 
05:06:30.548 --> 05:06:30.558 align:start position:0%
longer have their authority to conduct
 
05:06:32.948 --> 05:06:32.958 align:start position:0%
inspections and investigations supervise
 
05:06:34.830 --> 05:06:34.840 align:start position:0%
the public utilities keep itself
 
05:06:36.350 --> 05:06:36.360 align:start position:0%
informed regarding Utilities in the
 
05:06:38.750 --> 05:06:38.760 align:start position:0%
state or to receive reports of proposed
 
05:06:40.510 --> 05:06:40.520 align:start position:0%
Capital Improvements
 
05:06:42.230 --> 05:06:42.240 align:start position:0%
all of those duties would fall solely
 
05:06:44.708 --> 05:06:44.718 align:start position:0%
with the Department uh in addition the
 
05:06:45.868 --> 05:06:45.878 align:start position:0%
the commission would no longer have
 
05:06:47.628 --> 05:06:47.638 align:start position:0%
authority to question the justness or
 
05:06:49.470 --> 05:06:49.480 align:start position:0%
Reason reasonableness of settlements
 
05:06:50.990 --> 05:06:51.000 align:start position:0%
that are entered into by the department
 
05:06:53.470 --> 05:06:53.480 align:start position:0%
and the OCA and last the department
 
05:06:55.230 --> 05:06:55.240 align:start position:0%
would have the duty to be uh and be
 
05:06:57.628 --> 05:06:57.638 align:start position:0%
required to petition the commission for
 
05:07:00.070 --> 05:07:00.080 align:start position:0%
appropriate relief uh whenever the
 
05:07:01.708 --> 05:07:01.718 align:start position:0%
department reasonably believes that a
 
05:07:04.470 --> 05:07:04.480 align:start position:0%
public utility is failing to meet uh or
 
05:07:06.590 --> 05:07:06.600 align:start position:0%
discharge their obligations and uh all
 
05:07:08.310 --> 05:07:08.320 align:start position:0%
of that's variously problematic but that
 
05:07:10.470 --> 05:07:10.480 align:start position:0%
last bit is what I want to focus on on
 
05:07:12.270 --> 05:07:12.280 align:start position:0%
uh creating a duty for the Department of
 
05:07:14.990 --> 05:07:15.000 align:start position:0%
energy to petition the Pu for corrective
 
05:07:16.948 --> 05:07:16.958 align:start position:0%
action will add significant cost and
 
05:07:19.750 --> 05:07:19.760 align:start position:0%
inefficiency to some existing processes
 
05:07:22.470 --> 05:07:22.480 align:start position:0%
where the doe currently acts informally
 
05:07:24.750 --> 05:07:24.760 align:start position:0%
and independently from the commission uh
 
05:07:26.990 --> 05:07:27.000 align:start position:0%
to correct action by the utilities so to
 
05:07:29.350 --> 05:07:29.360 align:start position:0%
give you an example we are responsible
 
05:07:31.310 --> 05:07:31.320 align:start position:0%
for the enforcement of the underground
 
05:07:33.590 --> 05:07:33.600 align:start position:0%
damage prevention program more commonly
 
05:07:36.628 --> 05:07:36.638 align:start position:0%
known as digsafe and uh obviously
 
05:07:38.190 --> 05:07:38.200 align:start position:0%
utilities do a lot of the work that
 
05:07:40.110 --> 05:07:40.120 align:start position:0%
falls under dig saafe
 
05:07:41.990 --> 05:07:42.000 align:start position:0%
uh or their contractors do and
 
05:07:43.868 --> 05:07:43.878 align:start position:0%
potentially they are responsible for
 
05:07:45.270 --> 05:07:45.280 align:start position:0%
violations there and there there're a
 
05:07:47.868 --> 05:07:47.878 align:start position:0%
significant Chunk in the 40% range I
 
05:07:50.110 --> 05:07:50.120 align:start position:0%
think and I can get you in numbers on
 
05:07:52.030 --> 05:07:52.040 align:start position:0%
that but it's a significant chunk and so
 
05:07:56.150 --> 05:07:56.160 align:start position:0%
if we had to go uh to the Pu for every
 
05:07:58.430 --> 05:07:58.440 align:start position:0%
utility related Dig Safe violation that
 
05:08:01.030 --> 05:08:01.040 align:start position:0%
would add several dozen proceedings uh
 
05:08:03.470 --> 05:08:03.480 align:start position:0%
that we can currently resolve uh with a
 
05:08:05.628 --> 05:08:05.638 align:start position:0%
process that's laid out in rule but that
 
05:08:07.708 --> 05:08:07.718 align:start position:0%
is uh efficient and folks know how to
 
05:08:09.548 --> 05:08:09.558 align:start position:0%
work with it and we can you know Levy
 
05:08:11.030 --> 05:08:11.040 align:start position:0%
the appropriate penalties without
 
05:08:13.470 --> 05:08:13.480 align:start position:0%
creating the significant work associated
 
05:08:16.230 --> 05:08:16.240 align:start position:0%
with a pu proceeding uh the several
 
05:08:18.788 --> 05:08:18.798 align:start position:0%
dozen extra proceedings every year alone
 
05:08:20.830 --> 05:08:20.840 align:start position:0%
would represent a significant uh
 
05:08:24.670 --> 05:08:24.680 align:start position:0%
resource need for the Department uh to
 
05:08:29.310 --> 05:08:29.320 align:start position:0%
to uh have us be able to do a a function
 
05:08:31.350 --> 05:08:31.360 align:start position:0%
that we currently are able to do
 
05:08:32.830 --> 05:08:32.840 align:start position:0%
effectively and
 
05:08:35.788 --> 05:08:35.798 align:start position:0%
efficiently um so you know I think if
 
05:08:37.470 --> 05:08:37.480 align:start position:0%
this bill were to move forward there
 
05:08:39.470 --> 05:08:39.480 align:start position:0%
would be some significant needs from the
 
05:08:41.390 --> 05:08:41.400 align:start position:0%
Department in order to make sure we were
 
05:08:43.030 --> 05:08:43.040 align:start position:0%
not letting things fall through the
 
05:08:45.350 --> 05:08:45.360 align:start position:0%
cracks you know if you want to finish
 
05:08:47.548 --> 05:08:47.558 align:start position:0%
the job so to speak of clarifying the
 
05:08:48.788 --> 05:08:48.798 align:start position:0%
responsibilities it's going to
 
05:08:50.150 --> 05:08:50.160 align:start position:0%
significantly reduce the authority of
 
05:08:50.160 --> 05:08:50.868 align:start position:0%
significantly reduce the authority of
the

05:08:50.868 --> 05:08:50.878 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:08:53.750 --> 05:08:53.760 align:start position:0%
Pu and if you want to do that we should
 
05:08:55.030 --> 05:08:55.040 align:start position:0%
take some time with it part of the
 
05:08:56.628 --> 05:08:56.638 align:start position:0%
reason that the the restructuring of the
 
05:08:58.110 --> 05:08:58.120 align:start position:0%
Pu and the creation of the department
 
05:09:00.390 --> 05:09:00.400 align:start position:0%
was able to happen so quickly back in
 
05:09:02.590 --> 05:09:02.600 align:start position:0%
2021 was because of the guard rails and
 
05:09:04.830 --> 05:09:04.840 align:start position:0%
because of the overlapping jurisdictions
 
05:09:06.628 --> 05:09:06.638 align:start position:0%
and and and safeguards that we put into
 
05:09:08.470 --> 05:09:08.480 align:start position:0%
place so if you want to start removing
 
05:09:11.110 --> 05:09:11.120 align:start position:0%
those safeguards and and and uh you know
 
05:09:11.120 --> 05:09:12.030 align:start position:0%
those safeguards and and and uh you know
uh

05:09:12.030 --> 05:09:12.040 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:09:14.070 --> 05:09:14.080 align:start position:0%
jurisdictional uh add jurisdictional
 
05:09:16.150 --> 05:09:16.160 align:start position:0%
Clarity you can do that but we really
 
05:09:18.390 --> 05:09:18.400 align:start position:0%
ought to spend time with it you ought to
 
05:09:21.070 --> 05:09:21.080 align:start position:0%
bring in folks from uh you know your
 
05:09:24.030 --> 05:09:24.040 align:start position:0%
colleagues uh at Edna legislative
 
05:09:25.548 --> 05:09:25.558 align:start position:0%
leadership the governor's office the
 
05:09:27.030 --> 05:09:27.040 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office there would be
 
05:09:29.270 --> 05:09:29.280 align:start position:0%
a lot that would go into that and
 
05:09:31.948 --> 05:09:31.958 align:start position:0%
frankly uh you know I'm we're not sure
 
05:09:33.670 --> 05:09:33.680 align:start position:0%
that the the problem that this bill is
 
05:09:36.590 --> 05:09:36.600 align:start position:0%
solving is at this point you know ripe
 
05:09:38.150 --> 05:09:38.160 align:start position:0%
for the bill we have in front of us so
 
05:09:40.470 --> 05:09:40.480 align:start position:0%
obviously if you do intend to move
 
05:09:42.548 --> 05:09:42.558 align:start position:0%
forward with something uh the department
 
05:09:44.470 --> 05:09:44.480 align:start position:0%
would be happy to participate and happy
 
05:09:48.510 --> 05:09:48.520 align:start position:0%
to uh you know help help the legislature
 
05:09:50.948 --> 05:09:50.958 align:start position:0%
but as written we don't think this bill
 
05:09:53.270 --> 05:09:53.280 align:start position:0%
is ready to go happy to take
 
05:09:55.110 --> 05:09:55.120 align:start position:0%
questions unless David do you want to
 
05:09:57.110 --> 05:09:57.120 align:start position:0%
add anything
 
05:09:57.120 --> 05:09:59.110 align:start position:0%
add anything
okay

05:09:59.110 --> 05:09:59.120 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:10:02.548 --> 05:10:02.558 align:start position:0%
so this is a kind of a general concern
 
05:10:05.310 --> 05:10:05.320 align:start position:0%
of the committee but it's also specific
 
05:10:06.590 --> 05:10:06.600 align:start position:0%
to this
 
05:10:10.030 --> 05:10:10.040 align:start position:0%
bill if you look on the last page page
 
05:10:13.830 --> 05:10:13.840 align:start position:0%
of the reproduced copy of the
 
05:10:16.070 --> 05:10:16.080 align:start position:0%
legislation there is a fiscal
 
05:10:18.948 --> 05:10:18.958 align:start position:0%
note and the fiscal note says that the
 
05:10:21.910 --> 05:10:21.920 align:start position:0%
department was contacted on 12 2624 for
 
05:10:24.110 --> 05:10:24.120 align:start position:0%
a fiscal note
 
05:10:26.390 --> 05:10:26.400 align:start position:0%
worksheet and that when completed it
 
05:10:28.150 --> 05:10:28.160 align:start position:0%
will be forwarded to the house clerk's
 
05:10:31.830 --> 05:10:31.840 align:start position:0%
office well I've seen no sign of this
 
05:10:37.430 --> 05:10:37.440 align:start position:0%
fiscal note and I have a stack right
 
05:10:40.948 --> 05:10:40.958 align:start position:0%
here of
 
05:10:43.548 --> 05:10:43.558 align:start position:0%
fiscal notes for bills that have been
 
05:10:45.750 --> 05:10:45.760 align:start position:0%
assigned to this committee that all say
 
05:10:47.390 --> 05:10:47.400 align:start position:0%
the same
 
05:10:50.150 --> 05:10:50.160 align:start position:0%
thing where is it you know where are
 
05:10:53.390 --> 05:10:53.400 align:start position:0%
these fiscal notes and in particular
 
05:10:55.350 --> 05:10:55.360 align:start position:0%
we'd like to understand the financial
 
05:10:59.310 --> 05:10:59.320 align:start position:0%
implications of this bill so do you have
 
05:11:01.868 --> 05:11:01.878 align:start position:0%
any any information that you could
 
05:11:04.548 --> 05:11:04.558 align:start position:0%
Supply to us until we receive a fiscal
 
05:11:06.548 --> 05:11:06.558 align:start position:0%
note on this
 
05:11:09.830 --> 05:11:09.840 align:start position:0%
bill so we received about 30
 
05:11:11.548 --> 05:11:11.558 align:start position:0%
request for fiscal note worksheets
 
05:11:13.948 --> 05:11:13.958 align:start position:0%
during that time period it just takes a
 
05:11:16.150 --> 05:11:16.160 align:start position:0%
while to get through all of them but
 
05:11:18.708 --> 05:11:18.718 align:start position:0%
we've just about done that uh we did
 
05:11:21.910 --> 05:11:21.920 align:start position:0%
send uh a a fiscal note worksheet to the
 
05:11:27.350 --> 05:11:27.360 align:start position:0%
LBA for this bill just recently um and
 
05:11:30.910 --> 05:11:30.920 align:start position:0%
um our biggest concern is is the the
 
05:11:33.510 --> 05:11:33.520 align:start position:0%
duty uh imposed on us to take everything
 
05:11:36.510 --> 05:11:36.520 align:start position:0%
to the Pu that would require us we think
 
05:11:39.548 --> 05:11:39.558 align:start position:0%
to add at least three new employees
 
05:11:42.788 --> 05:11:42.798 align:start position:0%
uh to our staff at a cost of over
 
05:11:45.030 --> 05:11:45.040 align:start position:0%
$400,000 per year I think in the first
 
05:11:47.830 --> 05:11:47.840 align:start position:0%
year we're looking at
 
05:11:51.788 --> 05:11:51.798 align:start position:0%
$49,000 and by 2028 uh
 
05:11:55.390 --> 05:11:55.400 align:start position:0%
$427,000 a year and that in my
 
05:11:57.390 --> 05:11:57.400 align:start position:0%
estimation is actually a low ball in
 
05:11:59.150 --> 05:11:59.160 align:start position:0%
terms of the staff that we would need if
 
05:12:03.910 --> 05:12:03.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:05.910 --> 05:12:05.920 align:start position:0%
adjudication excellent that's the kind
 
05:12:08.350 --> 05:12:08.360 align:start position:0%
of information we need for bills like
 
05:12:12.350 --> 05:12:12.360 align:start position:0%
this representative McGee yeah I I don't
 
05:12:14.788 --> 05:12:14.798 align:start position:0%
know where are you referring to in this
 
05:12:16.910 --> 05:12:16.920 align:start position:0%
bill that it says that the department of
 
05:12:19.990 --> 05:12:20.000 align:start position:0%
energy would have to take everything to
 
05:12:22.548 --> 05:12:22.558 align:start position:0%
the Pu for adjudication because I didn't
 
05:12:24.510 --> 05:12:24.520 align:start position:0%
see that as being part of the
 
05:12:29.030 --> 05:12:29.040 align:start position:0%
bill uh so that would be on page two
 
05:12:31.590 --> 05:12:31.600 align:start position:0%
lines 5 through
 
05:12:37.070 --> 05:12:37.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:41.590 --> 05:12:41.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:46.510 --> 05:12:46.520 align:start position:0%
five this imposes imposes upon us a duty
 
05:12:47.910 --> 05:12:47.920 align:start position:0%
to petition the commission for
 
05:12:51.270 --> 05:12:51.280 align:start position:0%
appropriate relief either through and
 
05:12:52.830 --> 05:12:52.840 align:start position:0%
and there are statutes listed those are
 
05:12:56.270 --> 05:12:56.280 align:start position:0%
fining authorities or authorities to uh
 
05:12:58.430 --> 05:12:58.440 align:start position:0%
convince the Pu that a matter that we
 
05:13:00.708 --> 05:13:00.718 align:start position:0%
think is important enough uh should be
 
05:13:02.628 --> 05:13:02.638 align:start position:0%
taken to the Attorney General's office
 
05:13:05.230 --> 05:13:05.240 align:start position:0%
which we do on our own anyhow right but
 
05:13:06.948 --> 05:13:06.958 align:start position:0%
now we would have to go to the Pu and
 
05:13:10.150 --> 05:13:10.160 align:start position:0%
ask them to do it right um so there are
 
05:13:13.590 --> 05:13:13.600 align:start position:0%
a number of things uh you know where
 
05:13:15.628 --> 05:13:15.638 align:start position:0%
where we can see a public utility faing
 
05:13:19.230 --> 05:13:19.240 align:start position:0%
to discharge its obligations and um you
 
05:13:21.430 --> 05:13:21.440 align:start position:0%
know I don't want you to leave with the
 
05:13:23.310 --> 05:13:23.320 align:start position:0%
impression that public utilities are
 
05:13:26.310 --> 05:13:26.320 align:start position:0%
awful and they do everything wrong um
 
05:13:28.628 --> 05:13:28.638 align:start position:0%
but you know just given the size of our
 
05:13:30.948 --> 05:13:30.958 align:start position:0%
state the number of customers it it
 
05:13:36.270 --> 05:13:36.280 align:start position:0%
happens right um and uh what we normally
 
05:13:40.548 --> 05:13:40.558 align:start position:0%
do is we work with the utility to
 
05:13:42.190 --> 05:13:42.200 align:start position:0%
resolve the matter and we do it
 
05:13:44.708 --> 05:13:44.718 align:start position:0%
relatively inform in informally
 
05:13:47.510 --> 05:13:47.520 align:start position:0%
utilities are responsive uh for the most
 
05:13:51.150 --> 05:13:51.160 align:start position:0%
part um and we're able to resolve that
 
05:13:52.750 --> 05:13:52.760 align:start position:0%
but here if we find that they're
 
05:13:55.868 --> 05:13:55.878 align:start position:0%
violating a rule right and they violated
 
05:13:57.830 --> 05:13:57.840 align:start position:0%
a rule and failed to discharge their
 
05:13:59.788 --> 05:13:59.798 align:start position:0%
obligations we have to go to the Pu and
 
05:14:02.430 --> 05:14:02.440 align:start position:0%
ask for them to be fined that's what the
 
05:14:04.230 --> 05:14:04.240 align:start position:0%
that's the meaning of this this
 
05:14:07.948 --> 05:14:07.958 align:start position:0%
statement and yeah that's that's he
 
05:14:10.390 --> 05:14:10.400 align:start position:0%
wasn't finished explaining okay no I
 
05:14:12.670 --> 05:14:12.680 align:start position:0%
that's that's basically it yeah okay
 
05:14:15.270 --> 05:14:15.280 align:start position:0%
follow up please thank you um so that
 
05:14:18.270 --> 05:14:18.280 align:start position:0%
sounds like that might be a place where
 
05:14:19.990 --> 05:14:20.000 align:start position:0%
from the sounds of it everyone could
 
05:14:23.030 --> 05:14:23.040 align:start position:0%
agree that maybe that is a bridge too
 
05:14:24.948 --> 05:14:24.958 align:start position:0%
far and is maybe not going to increase
 
05:14:26.990 --> 05:14:27.000 align:start position:0%
efficiency right if it's going to uh
 
05:14:30.150 --> 05:14:30.160 align:start position:0%
remove something from the doe that you
 
05:14:31.830 --> 05:14:31.840 align:start position:0%
currently can do in an informal way and
 
05:14:33.510 --> 05:14:33.520 align:start position:0%
it doesn't have to be gummed up with
 
05:14:33.520 --> 05:14:34.868 align:start position:0%
it doesn't have to be gummed up with
more

05:14:34.868 --> 05:14:34.878 align:start position:0%
more
 
05:14:39.190 --> 05:14:39.200 align:start position:0%
regulatory but my question would be it's
 
05:14:41.230 --> 05:14:41.240 align:start position:0%
sounds as though I mean we we heard
 
05:14:43.788 --> 05:14:43.798 align:start position:0%
testimony that we've gone to a dozen
 
05:14:46.510 --> 05:14:46.520 align:start position:0%
people from about 70s something with
 
05:14:49.590 --> 05:14:49.600 align:start position:0%
this you know reorg it sounds as though
 
05:14:51.868 --> 05:14:51.878 align:start position:0%
the Pu may be understaffed in terms of
 
05:14:53.708 --> 05:14:53.718 align:start position:0%
people that you guys took under your
 
05:14:56.310 --> 05:14:56.320 align:start position:0%
wing At Doe I mean attorney shock you're
 
05:14:59.990 --> 05:15:00.000 align:start position:0%
one of them um so I'm just curious is is
 
05:15:02.670 --> 05:15:02.680 align:start position:0%
there any conversation about adequate
 
05:15:05.190 --> 05:15:05.200 align:start position:0%
Staffing for the Pu to be able to
 
05:15:07.510 --> 05:15:07.520 align:start position:0%
conduct the kind of proceedings they're
 
05:15:10.910 --> 05:15:10.920 align:start position:0%
looking to do so that maybe they
 
05:15:15.670 --> 05:15:15.680 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have to um pull up at a
 
05:15:17.948 --> 05:15:17.958 align:start position:0%
settlement or at at a point where people
 
05:15:20.110 --> 05:15:20.120 align:start position:0%
are ready to move forward and and get it
 
05:15:21.830 --> 05:15:21.840 align:start position:0%
get it off the books and go on to the
 
05:15:24.190 --> 05:15:24.200 align:start position:0%
next thing um because it seems to be
 
05:15:27.510 --> 05:15:27.520 align:start position:0%
that that might have been the impetus
 
05:15:29.830 --> 05:15:29.840 align:start position:0%
for us to be taking a look at how well
 
05:15:32.230 --> 05:15:32.240 align:start position:0%
it's working sure and it's a good
 
05:15:33.470 --> 05:15:33.480 align:start position:0%
question thank thank you very much
 
05:15:35.470 --> 05:15:35.480 align:start position:0%
representative um and and and I don't
 
05:15:36.788 --> 05:15:36.798 align:start position:0%
want to speak obviously for the
 
05:15:38.990 --> 05:15:39.000 align:start position:0%
Commission in their own uh you know
 
05:15:40.350 --> 05:15:40.360 align:start position:0%
staffing needs because that's something
 
05:15:42.030 --> 05:15:42.040 align:start position:0%
that they should be able to articulate
 
05:15:43.510 --> 05:15:43.520 align:start position:0%
and obviously we're in a budget process
 
05:15:45.350 --> 05:15:45.360 align:start position:0%
and the agency you know as the governor
 
05:15:47.110 --> 05:15:47.120 align:start position:0%
is putting their their things together
 
05:15:49.548 --> 05:15:49.558 align:start position:0%
they had an opportunity in this budget
 
05:15:51.030 --> 05:15:51.040 align:start position:0%
and previous budgets to bring forward
 
05:15:53.470 --> 05:15:53.480 align:start position:0%
some of those considerations uh you know
 
05:15:55.070 --> 05:15:55.080 align:start position:0%
we certainly have and and every state
 
05:15:58.190 --> 05:15:58.200 align:start position:0%
agency does look at that um you know
 
05:16:00.030 --> 05:16:00.040 align:start position:0%
going back to in my background to when
 
05:16:01.910 --> 05:16:01.920 align:start position:0%
this was put into effect I think that
 
05:16:04.590 --> 05:16:04.600 align:start position:0%
does show some of the legislative intent
 
05:16:07.230 --> 05:16:07.240 align:start position:0%
of what was was was envisioned for the
 
05:16:09.708 --> 05:16:09.718 align:start position:0%
Pu uh when that was being created and
 
05:16:11.868 --> 05:16:11.878 align:start position:0%
obviously the chairman of the Pu at the
 
05:16:14.110 --> 05:16:14.120 align:start position:0%
time as we know was was you know
 
05:16:17.350 --> 05:16:17.360 align:start position:0%
involved in those conversations to um
 
05:16:20.070 --> 05:16:20.080 align:start position:0%
you know uh look at look at uh what this
 
05:16:21.910 --> 05:16:21.920 align:start position:0%
new iteration what this new department
 
05:16:23.830 --> 05:16:23.840 align:start position:0%
and commission are going to look like
 
05:16:25.830 --> 05:16:25.840 align:start position:0%
and that was where folks landed and
 
05:16:29.310 --> 05:16:29.320 align:start position:0%
there obviously were some changing of
 
05:16:31.310 --> 05:16:31.320 align:start position:0%
personnel we had a lot of people come to
 
05:16:33.990 --> 05:16:34.000 align:start position:0%
the doe who were existing employees that
 
05:16:36.670 --> 05:16:36.680 align:start position:0%
we also added six highlevel unclassified
 
05:16:38.510 --> 05:16:38.520 align:start position:0%
positions as senior advisers over at the
 
05:16:38.520 --> 05:16:39.430 align:start position:0%
positions as senior advisers over at the
Pu

05:16:39.430 --> 05:16:39.440 align:start position:0%
Pu
 
05:16:41.788 --> 05:16:41.798 align:start position:0%
to help give them an opportunity to have
 
05:16:43.470 --> 05:16:43.480 align:start position:0%
experienced attorneys and analysts who
 
05:16:46.948 --> 05:16:46.958 align:start position:0%
can participate uh in the process um and
 
05:16:49.230 --> 05:16:49.240 align:start position:0%
when you look at sort of the size of the
 
05:16:52.670 --> 05:16:52.680 align:start position:0%
agency um you know we have what you know
 
05:16:56.150 --> 05:16:56.160 align:start position:0%
uh somewhere it's in the in the 80s uh
 
05:16:58.070 --> 05:16:58.080 align:start position:0%
now and obviously with uh full-time
 
05:16:59.868 --> 05:16:59.878 align:start position:0%
temporary positions part-time employees
 
05:17:02.390 --> 05:17:02.400 align:start position:0%
it's it's close to 90 uh employees at
 
05:17:04.070 --> 05:17:04.080 align:start position:0%
the department of energy well that
 
05:17:05.670 --> 05:17:05.680 align:start position:0%
includes a lot of folks who are
 
05:17:07.628 --> 05:17:07.638 align:start position:0%
implementing programs who are our
 
05:17:09.270 --> 05:17:09.280 align:start position:0%
consumer services folks who are working
 
05:17:11.708 --> 05:17:11.718 align:start position:0%
in our business office who are uh going
 
05:17:13.150 --> 05:17:13.160 align:start position:0%
out and doing pipeline safety
 
05:17:14.788 --> 05:17:14.798 align:start position:0%
inspections and things like that so when
 
05:17:16.470 --> 05:17:16.480 align:start position:0%
you talk about what the
 
05:17:19.230 --> 05:17:19.240 align:start position:0%
regulatory uh you know Frontline uh
 
05:17:21.990 --> 05:17:22.000 align:start position:0%
workers are I I I think uh as as Mr
 
05:17:24.590 --> 05:17:24.600 align:start position:0%
spidel or attorney spidel alluded to you
 
05:17:27.030 --> 05:17:27.040 align:start position:0%
know we don't have a a
 
05:17:30.430 --> 05:17:30.440 align:start position:0%
significantly uh more large group you
 
05:17:33.510 --> 05:17:33.520 align:start position:0%
know we have uh less than 20 folks uh in
 
05:17:35.590 --> 05:17:35.600 align:start position:0%
our util utility analysts in our
 
05:17:37.868 --> 05:17:37.878 align:start position:0%
regulatory Support Division we have a
 
05:17:40.510 --> 05:17:40.520 align:start position:0%
handful of attorneys so obviously there
 
05:17:42.990 --> 05:17:43.000 align:start position:0%
are uh there's a lot of work to go
 
05:17:45.708 --> 05:17:45.718 align:start position:0%
around I think part of the uh the
 
05:17:47.350 --> 05:17:47.360 align:start position:0%
Staffing that was envisioned at the time
 
05:17:49.430 --> 05:17:49.440 align:start position:0%
was that the Pu is going to have a
 
05:17:51.708 --> 05:17:51.718 align:start position:0%
reduced role from what they had uh prior
 
05:17:56.628 --> 05:17:56.638 align:start position:0%
to the split in 2021 um so you know uh I
 
05:17:57.990 --> 05:17:58.000 align:start position:0%
hope that answers your question David I
 
05:18:01.270 --> 05:18:01.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:04.230 --> 05:18:04.240 align:start position:0%
anything I thought you just had one no
 
05:18:05.350 --> 05:18:05.360 align:start position:0%
yeah I think you
 
05:18:09.628 --> 05:18:09.638 align:start position:0%
did so we've been told by the finance
 
05:18:11.548 --> 05:18:11.558 align:start position:0%
committee the house finance committee
 
05:18:13.708 --> 05:18:13.718 align:start position:0%
that we should not bring them any
 
05:18:17.548 --> 05:18:17.558 align:start position:0%
bills that require the expenditure of
 
05:18:20.390 --> 05:18:20.400 align:start position:0%
funds without an
 
05:18:22.910 --> 05:18:22.920 align:start position:0%
appropriation and this be Bill appears
 
05:18:24.708 --> 05:18:24.718 align:start position:0%
to fall into that
 
05:18:28.510 --> 05:18:28.520 align:start position:0%
category as someone who has to deal with
 
05:18:32.510 --> 05:18:32.520 align:start position:0%
uh their agency budget do you see that
 
05:18:34.868 --> 05:18:34.878 align:start position:0%
as a significant problem to this bill
 
05:18:39.110 --> 05:18:39.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:40.548 --> 05:18:40.558 align:start position:0%
that's a good question it obviously
 
05:18:41.548 --> 05:18:41.558 align:start position:0%
doesn't have a general fund
 
05:18:43.310 --> 05:18:43.320 align:start position:0%
appropriation but the employees that
 
05:18:45.350 --> 05:18:45.360 align:start position:0%
we'd be envisioning there are are a
 
05:18:47.750 --> 05:18:47.760 align:start position:0%
combination of uh assessment funds in
 
05:18:49.868 --> 05:18:49.878 align:start position:0%
which case that that would have to be
 
05:18:52.270 --> 05:18:52.280 align:start position:0%
accounted for in the utility assessment
 
05:18:54.430 --> 05:18:54.440 align:start position:0%
uh specifically with the Dig Safe
 
05:18:56.310 --> 05:18:56.320 align:start position:0%
program which is where I had a lot of
 
05:18:58.150 --> 05:18:58.160 align:start position:0%
concerns in terms of having to staff up
 
05:19:01.910 --> 05:19:01.920 align:start position:0%
those are federal funds and obviously uh
 
05:19:04.230 --> 05:19:04.240 align:start position:0%
even even prior to the change in
 
05:19:06.310 --> 05:19:06.320 align:start position:0%
administration uh I I would have to go
 
05:19:08.430 --> 05:19:08.440 align:start position:0%
back and see if we were going to be able
 
05:19:10.868 --> 05:19:10.878 align:start position:0%
to to uh get the necessary federal funds
 
05:19:12.990 --> 05:19:13.000 align:start position:0%
to match whatever we would need to do to
 
05:19:14.750 --> 05:19:14.760 align:start position:0%
ramp up our underground damage
 
05:19:17.590 --> 05:19:17.600 align:start position:0%
prevention staff and obviously um
 
05:19:19.628 --> 05:19:19.638 align:start position:0%
there's there a lot of questions now
 
05:19:20.990 --> 05:19:21.000 align:start position:0%
related to where Federal funding is
 
05:19:23.990 --> 05:19:24.000 align:start position:0%
going to go um and so I could not tell
 
05:19:25.590 --> 05:19:25.600 align:start position:0%
you that we would have the funding
 
05:19:29.150 --> 05:19:29.160 align:start position:0%
available on the federal side to to do
 
05:19:32.548 --> 05:19:32.558 align:start position:0%
what we needed to do okay representative
 
05:19:35.110 --> 05:19:35.120 align:start position:0%
Wendy Thomas thank you Mr
 
05:19:40.868 --> 05:19:40.878 align:start position:0%
chair I'm sorry oh so um so this is in
 
05:19:42.948 --> 05:19:42.958 align:start position:0%
regards to what you pointed out on page
 
05:19:45.628 --> 05:19:45.638 align:start position:0%
three the highlighted section um and
 
05:19:47.548 --> 05:19:47.558 align:start position:0%
your concern is that you would have to
 
05:19:49.750 --> 05:19:49.760 align:start position:0%
go if this passed you would have to go
 
05:19:53.310 --> 05:19:53.320 align:start position:0%
directly to the puc for any cases or
 
05:19:57.030 --> 05:19:57.040 align:start position:0%
matters um that would come to the doe
 
05:19:59.150 --> 05:19:59.160 align:start position:0%
can you give me an idea of how many
 
05:20:00.910 --> 05:20:00.920 align:start position:0%
cases or matters we're talking about on
 
05:20:03.470 --> 05:20:03.480 align:start position:0%
a yearly basis I think it's ranged from
 
05:20:06.270 --> 05:20:06.280 align:start position:0%
40 to 70 in recent years uh just on the
 
05:20:08.990 --> 05:20:09.000 align:start position:0%
Dig Safe program alone
 
05:20:11.548 --> 05:20:11.558 align:start position:0%
for utility related Dig Safe violations
 
05:20:14.750 --> 05:20:14.760 align:start position:0%
followup followup and and so you
 
05:20:17.070 --> 05:20:17.080 align:start position:0%
testified that we need three or four
 
05:20:20.750 --> 05:20:20.760 align:start position:0%
additional staff members to handle 40 to
 
05:20:24.910 --> 05:20:24.920 align:start position:0%
70 matters a year is that correct yeah
 
05:20:26.868 --> 05:20:26.878 align:start position:0%
uh yeah so in that case we would likely
 
05:20:29.270 --> 05:20:29.280 align:start position:0%
need to ramp up our our actual
 
05:20:31.270 --> 05:20:31.280 align:start position:0%
inspection staff the folks going out to
 
05:20:33.470 --> 05:20:33.480 align:start position:0%
do the Dig Safe inspections because
 
05:20:36.670 --> 05:20:36.680 align:start position:0%
those folks would need to be able to um
 
05:20:39.830 --> 05:20:39.840 align:start position:0%
you know you know ramp up their own
 
05:20:41.350 --> 05:20:41.360 align:start position:0%
individual time where they would be
 
05:20:43.910 --> 05:20:43.920 align:start position:0%
spending having to go and take about 40%
 
05:20:45.350 --> 05:20:45.360 align:start position:0%
of their violations through this
 
05:20:47.910 --> 05:20:47.920 align:start position:0%
adjudicated process uh our attorney
 
05:20:49.948 --> 05:20:49.958 align:start position:0%
workload is already pretty strained so
 
05:20:52.310 --> 05:20:52.320 align:start position:0%
that would probably necessitate another
 
05:20:56.350 --> 05:20:56.360 align:start position:0%
attorney um what am I I just want to say
 
05:20:58.990 --> 05:20:59.000 align:start position:0%
it's not just Dig Safe that's just an
 
05:21:02.390 --> 05:21:02.400 align:start position:0%
example so um you know
 
05:21:06.230 --> 05:21:06.240 align:start position:0%
what uh we prosecute approximately 140
 
05:21:09.868 --> 05:21:09.878 align:start position:0%
Dig Safe violations a year
 
05:21:13.830 --> 05:21:13.840 align:start position:0%
about half of those are directly with
 
05:21:16.670 --> 05:21:16.680 align:start position:0%
utilities um plus we have pipeline
 
05:21:18.590 --> 05:21:18.600 align:start position:0%
safety violations which are different
 
05:21:20.470 --> 05:21:20.480 align:start position:0%
from Dig Safe that's enforcement of a
 
05:21:23.030 --> 05:21:23.040 align:start position:0%
federal pipeline
 
05:21:26.750 --> 05:21:26.760 align:start position:0%
program um and then we have thousands
 
05:21:30.708 --> 05:21:30.718 align:start position:0%
and thousands and thousands of consumer
 
05:21:33.190 --> 05:21:33.200 align:start position:0%
contacts uh with consumers complaining
 
05:21:36.110 --> 05:21:36.120 align:start position:0%
that a utility has violated a rule uh
 
05:21:38.708 --> 05:21:38.718 align:start position:0%
they've mischarged on their bill uh
 
05:21:41.190 --> 05:21:41.200 align:start position:0%
they're not charging fairly all of which
 
05:21:43.390 --> 05:21:43.400 align:start position:0%
would be failure to perform obligations
 
05:21:45.030 --> 05:21:45.040 align:start position:0%
under the title and would have to be
 
05:21:47.110 --> 05:21:47.120 align:start position:0%
brought to the Public Utilities
 
05:21:49.030 --> 05:21:49.040 align:start position:0%
Commission rather than informally
 
05:21:51.548 --> 05:21:51.558 align:start position:0%
resolved as we currently
 
05:21:53.868 --> 05:21:53.878 align:start position:0%
do and just to add to that obviously
 
05:21:56.190 --> 05:21:56.200 align:start position:0%
staff we going to be going to the Pu to
 
05:21:59.270 --> 05:21:59.280 align:start position:0%
be sworn in to testify in that setting
 
05:22:01.190 --> 05:22:01.200 align:start position:0%
uh that is a skill set that Demands a
 
05:22:04.270 --> 05:22:04.280 align:start position:0%
higher you know level of of uh
 
05:22:06.990 --> 05:22:07.000 align:start position:0%
experience and that
 
05:22:09.230 --> 05:22:09.240 align:start position:0%
expertise okay additional questions
 
05:22:11.628 --> 05:22:11.638 align:start position:0%
representative McGee has another thank
 
05:22:13.590 --> 05:22:13.600 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman and thank you for taking
 
05:22:16.350 --> 05:22:16.360 align:start position:0%
my question so I think when the consumer
 
05:22:19.190 --> 05:22:19.200 align:start position:0%
Advocate uh spoke on this bill he
 
05:22:21.868 --> 05:22:21.878 align:start position:0%
mentioned that it was sort of a it was a
 
05:22:23.350 --> 05:22:23.360 align:start position:0%
starting point to get the conversation
 
05:22:25.350 --> 05:22:25.360 align:start position:0%
going to let us become more aware of
 
05:22:27.708 --> 05:22:27.718 align:start position:0%
what the problems might be if the bolded
 
05:22:30.548 --> 05:22:30.558 align:start position:0%
language uh on page three between lines
 
05:22:35.430 --> 05:22:35.440 align:start position:0%
two and and five was removed then would
 
05:22:39.590 --> 05:22:39.600 align:start position:0%
that also negate the need for the note
 
05:22:40.948 --> 05:22:40.958 align:start position:0%
because that's the only part of the bill
 
05:22:42.788 --> 05:22:42.798 align:start position:0%
where it appears that would be Personnel
 
05:22:42.798 --> 05:22:44.948 align:start position:0%
where it appears that would be Personnel
involved

05:22:44.948 --> 05:22:44.958 align:start position:0%
involved
 
05:22:48.910 --> 05:22:48.920 align:start position:0%
correct we'd have to go back and focus
 
05:22:51.310 --> 05:22:51.320 align:start position:0%
on the other duties so one of the things
 
05:22:52.670 --> 05:22:52.680 align:start position:0%
that would happen when you took
 
05:22:54.590 --> 05:22:54.600 align:start position:0%
supervisory Authority away from the
 
05:22:56.750 --> 05:22:56.760 align:start position:0%
commission and allowed them only to
 
05:23:00.230 --> 05:23:00.240 align:start position:0%
adjudicate contested cases right uh
 
05:23:01.910 --> 05:23:01.920 align:start position:0%
would be
 
05:23:04.190 --> 05:23:04.200 align:start position:0%
that we would be supervising the
 
05:23:06.670 --> 05:23:06.680 align:start position:0%
attorneys as the or I'm sorry the um the
 
05:23:08.948 --> 05:23:08.958 align:start position:0%
utilities at the department
 
05:23:13.470 --> 05:23:13.480 align:start position:0%
and agencies supervis by rule now uh
 
05:23:18.190 --> 05:23:18.200 align:start position:0%
when the reorganization first took place
 
05:23:21.788 --> 05:23:21.798 align:start position:0%
uh we were confronted with the task of
 
05:23:24.830 --> 05:23:24.840 align:start position:0%
taking the public utility commission's
 
05:23:27.868 --> 05:23:27.878 align:start position:0%
uh rules and dividing those sets into
 
05:23:29.868 --> 05:23:29.878 align:start position:0%
rules for each of the agencies we're
 
05:23:32.190 --> 05:23:32.200 align:start position:0%
only about three4 of the way through
 
05:23:35.390 --> 05:23:35.400 align:start position:0%
that three and a half years in right in
 
05:23:37.110 --> 05:23:37.120 align:start position:0%
addition to that we would have to create
 
05:23:40.030 --> 05:23:40.040 align:start position:0%
rule sets for things that are currently
 
05:23:43.548 --> 05:23:43.558 align:start position:0%
handled in uh commission investigations
 
05:23:45.310 --> 05:23:45.320 align:start position:0%
and other types of dockets including
 
05:23:47.230 --> 05:23:47.240 align:start position:0%
adjudications where things are handled
 
05:23:50.670 --> 05:23:50.680 align:start position:0%
by settlement um and probably could no
 
05:23:54.670 --> 05:23:54.680 align:start position:0%
longer be handled that way so it would
 
05:23:58.150 --> 05:23:58.160 align:start position:0%
there would be quite a bit of work right
 
05:24:00.390 --> 05:24:00.400 align:start position:0%
which uh in the original reorganization
 
05:24:02.708 --> 05:24:02.718 align:start position:0%
was planned to happen afterwards here we
 
05:24:04.390 --> 05:24:04.400 align:start position:0%
have the opportunity to give it some
 
05:24:06.990 --> 05:24:07.000 align:start position:0%
forethought and uh that that would be
 
05:24:10.350 --> 05:24:10.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:12.110 --> 05:24:12.120 align:start position:0%
follow up The Logical followup would
 
05:24:13.510 --> 05:24:13.520 align:start position:0%
just be how you said you're three
 
05:24:15.030 --> 05:24:15.040 align:start position:0%
quarters the way through so when do you
 
05:24:16.990 --> 05:24:17.000 align:start position:0%
anticipate that you would have that
 
05:24:19.750 --> 05:24:19.760 align:start position:0%
information uh we expect to be through
 
05:24:22.190 --> 05:24:22.200 align:start position:0%
separating the the rule
 
05:24:27.510 --> 05:24:27.520 align:start position:0%
sets um I think in the fall of 2026 is
 
05:24:31.470 --> 05:24:31.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:34.590 --> 05:24:34.600 align:start position:0%
timeline representative CL has a
 
05:24:37.030 --> 05:24:37.040 align:start position:0%
question uh thank you chair and thank
 
05:24:39.110 --> 05:24:39.120 align:start position:0%
you commissioner
 
05:24:41.670 --> 05:24:41.680 align:start position:0%
um I have a question after I mentioned
 
05:24:44.470 --> 05:24:44.480 align:start position:0%
three notes I'm going to paraphrase from
 
05:24:47.070 --> 05:24:47.080 align:start position:0%
early testimony with the consumer
 
05:24:49.990 --> 05:24:50.000 align:start position:0%
advocate in the Pu uh I got a note here
 
05:24:53.670 --> 05:24:53.680 align:start position:0%
that um the department of energy and the
 
05:24:57.190 --> 05:24:57.200 align:start position:0%
puc needed guidance
 
05:25:01.948 --> 05:25:01.958 align:start position:0%
um excuse me um and then yourself
 
05:25:04.230 --> 05:25:04.240 align:start position:0%
mentioned that there's overlapping from
 
05:25:07.510 --> 05:25:07.520 align:start position:0%
the previous legislation between the doe
 
05:25:11.830 --> 05:25:11.840 align:start position:0%
and the pu which still allowed you to
 
05:25:15.350 --> 05:25:15.360 align:start position:0%
function even with the internal issues
 
05:25:19.708 --> 05:25:19.718 align:start position:0%
the question now is does the dle benefit
 
05:25:21.270 --> 05:25:21.280 align:start position:0%
from the
 
05:25:24.788 --> 05:25:24.798 align:start position:0%
legisl asking to look into this again to
 
05:25:29.070 --> 05:25:29.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:31.430 --> 05:25:31.440 align:start position:0%
guidance that's a good question it's a
 
05:25:32.510 --> 05:25:32.520 align:start position:0%
very good question thank you
 
05:25:34.470 --> 05:25:34.480 align:start position:0%
representative you know I I think from
 
05:25:37.350 --> 05:25:37.360 align:start position:0%
our perspective we view our role as the
 
05:25:40.390 --> 05:25:40.400 align:start position:0%
executive branch agency to to respond to
 
05:25:42.628 --> 05:25:42.638 align:start position:0%
what the legislature wants right so if
 
05:25:44.868 --> 05:25:44.878 align:start position:0%
you are hearing from folks if you feel
 
05:25:47.190 --> 05:25:47.200 align:start position:0%
like things need to be clarified then
 
05:25:48.830 --> 05:25:48.840 align:start position:0%
that's something we would we would be
 
05:25:52.390 --> 05:25:52.400 align:start position:0%
prepared to help you do we don't see it
 
05:25:55.150 --> 05:25:55.160 align:start position:0%
as our role as the department of energy
 
05:25:57.390 --> 05:25:57.400 align:start position:0%
as the administrative state to tell you
 
05:25:59.670 --> 05:25:59.680 align:start position:0%
what things should be like we see it as
 
05:26:01.670 --> 05:26:01.680 align:start position:0%
your role to tell us what the problem is
 
05:26:03.868 --> 05:26:03.878 align:start position:0%
and we help you fix it so that's that's
 
05:26:05.628 --> 05:26:05.638 align:start position:0%
kind of how I view it I hope that's
 
05:26:07.470 --> 05:26:07.480 align:start position:0%
answers your question if you want to do
 
05:26:09.628 --> 05:26:09.638 align:start position:0%
something we're here to help you but we
 
05:26:11.390 --> 05:26:11.400 align:start position:0%
don't we don't want to tell you this is
 
05:26:13.628 --> 05:26:13.638 align:start position:0%
what must happen because we know better
 
05:26:13.638 --> 05:26:15.110 align:start position:0%
what must happen because we know better
than

05:26:15.110 --> 05:26:15.120 align:start position:0%
than
 
05:26:20.190 --> 05:26:20.200 align:start position:0%
you follow uh thank you and to the chair
 
05:26:23.350 --> 05:26:23.360 align:start position:0%
yes um I anticipated your answer I just
 
05:26:27.190 --> 05:26:27.200 align:start position:0%
wanted to get on record that I saw some
 
05:26:31.470 --> 05:26:31.480 align:start position:0%
a need of something thank you thank
 
05:26:33.750 --> 05:26:33.760 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
05:26:36.230 --> 05:26:36.240 align:start position:0%
Kaplan thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
05:26:38.788 --> 05:26:38.798 align:start position:0%
gentlemen um
 
05:26:39.948 --> 05:26:39.958 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm I'm trying to wrap my head
 
05:26:41.868 --> 05:26:41.878 align:start position:0%
around this uh and so from your
 
05:26:44.070 --> 05:26:44.080 align:start position:0%
testimony it sounds like you know it
 
05:26:46.590 --> 05:26:46.600 align:start position:0%
cuts both ways like this this bill could
 
05:26:48.510 --> 05:26:48.520 align:start position:0%
bring up as many problems as it causes
 
05:26:51.670 --> 05:26:51.680 align:start position:0%
and uh the the system that is in play in
 
05:26:53.628 --> 05:26:53.638 align:start position:0%
place now has sort of built in
 
05:26:55.670 --> 05:26:55.680 align:start position:0%
redundancies which also cut both ways
 
05:26:58.270 --> 05:26:58.280 align:start position:0%
that could be good or bad um and you
 
05:27:00.788 --> 05:27:00.798 align:start position:0%
mentioned that you are working it out
 
05:27:02.070 --> 05:27:02.080 align:start position:0%
that that you know that that it's
 
05:27:04.548 --> 05:27:04.558 align:start position:0%
evolving and it's getting better um but
 
05:27:06.190 --> 05:27:06.200 align:start position:0%
we have some serious concerns that have
 
05:27:09.110 --> 05:27:09.120 align:start position:0%
been raised here and so I want some more
 
05:27:12.110 --> 05:27:12.120 align:start position:0%
clarification if I could from you uh as
 
05:27:15.150 --> 05:27:15.160 align:start position:0%
to could you give us an example using
 
05:27:17.270 --> 05:27:17.280 align:start position:0%
the the net metering docket for for you
 
05:27:18.670 --> 05:27:18.680 align:start position:0%
know for instance could you give us an
 
05:27:20.750 --> 05:27:20.760 align:start position:0%
example of how that will be improved
 
05:27:23.190 --> 05:27:23.200 align:start position:0%
upon so that we don't have these the
 
05:27:25.590 --> 05:27:25.600 align:start position:0%
same issues arising in the future I
 
05:27:27.030 --> 05:27:27.040 align:start position:0%
apologize I don't what was the issue
 
05:27:29.750 --> 05:27:29.760 align:start position:0%
with the net metering docket I mean it
 
05:27:31.910 --> 05:27:31.920 align:start position:0%
was raised in previous testimony here
 
05:27:34.190 --> 05:27:34.200 align:start position:0%
that that was an example that where the
 
05:27:36.868 --> 05:27:36.878 align:start position:0%
parties had come to an agreement uh had
 
05:27:39.270 --> 05:27:39.280 align:start position:0%
come before the Pu and then the Pu you
 
05:27:40.990 --> 05:27:41.000 align:start position:0%
know sort of scuttled it and said you
 
05:27:43.750 --> 05:27:43.760 align:start position:0%
know we're going to well I appreciate
 
05:27:44.948 --> 05:27:44.958 align:start position:0%
that representative in the net metering
 
05:27:46.868 --> 05:27:46.878 align:start position:0%
docket my understanding was that there
 
05:27:48.788 --> 05:27:48.798 align:start position:0%
were essentially three proposals one
 
05:27:51.030 --> 05:27:51.040 align:start position:0%
that was a a settlement by many of the
 
05:27:52.350 --> 05:27:52.360 align:start position:0%
parties one from Community power
 
05:27:53.510 --> 05:27:53.520 align:start position:0%
Coalition of New Hampshire and then
 
05:27:56.110 --> 05:27:56.120 align:start position:0%
another from the Department of energy uh
 
05:27:58.230 --> 05:27:58.240 align:start position:0%
and the department of energy differed on
 
05:28:00.270 --> 05:28:00.280 align:start position:0%
the issue of a legacy period related to
 
05:28:01.708 --> 05:28:01.718 align:start position:0%
net metering from the settlement
 
05:28:03.750 --> 05:28:03.760 align:start position:0%
agreement and the Pu more or less
 
05:28:05.030 --> 05:28:05.040 align:start position:0%
adopted the department of Energy's
 
05:28:07.190 --> 05:28:07.200 align:start position:0%
position so we didn't have an issue
 
05:28:09.030 --> 05:28:09.040 align:start position:0%
there with the
 
05:28:15.750 --> 05:28:15.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:18.390 --> 05:28:18.400 align:start position:0%
one okay seeing no further questions we
 
05:28:20.430 --> 05:28:20.440 align:start position:0%
want to thank you both for being here
 
05:28:23.270 --> 05:28:23.280 align:start position:0%

05:28:25.390 --> 05:28:25.400 align:start position:0%

resiliency otherwise known as C
 
05:32:20.350 --> 05:32:20.360 align:start position:0%
Pacer you will note if you look at the
 
05:32:23.948 --> 05:32:23.958 align:start position:0%
first page of the bill the sponsor list
 
05:32:26.910 --> 05:32:26.920 align:start position:0%

05:32:33.868 --> 05:32:33.878 align:start position:0%
bipartisan submission representative s
 
05:32:36.948 --> 05:32:36.958 align:start position:0%
Simpson of course is the minority leader
 
05:32:39.830 --> 05:32:39.840 align:start position:0%
in the house
 
05:32:43.628 --> 05:32:43.638 align:start position:0%
this is the third time that or at least
 
05:32:45.788 --> 05:32:45.798 align:start position:0%
the third time since I've been involved
 
05:32:47.750 --> 05:32:47.760 align:start position:0%
with the legislature that this
 
05:32:50.150 --> 05:32:50.160 align:start position:0%
legislation has come before the house
 
05:32:52.948 --> 05:32:52.958 align:start position:0%
we've passed two previous versions of
 
05:32:52.958 --> 05:32:54.670 align:start position:0%
we've passed two previous versions of
this

05:32:54.670 --> 05:32:54.680 align:start position:0%
this
 
05:32:56.708 --> 05:32:56.718 align:start position:0%
program which is a program that's
 
05:32:58.750 --> 05:32:58.760 align:start position:0%
modeled after legislation that was
 
05:33:00.910 --> 05:33:00.920 align:start position:0%
developed elsewhere in the
 
05:33:05.030 --> 05:33:05.040 align:start position:0%
country to enable the creation
 
05:33:09.350 --> 05:33:09.360 align:start position:0%
of clean in industry districts within
 
05:33:11.548 --> 05:33:11.558 align:start position:0%
municipalities to assist with the
 
05:33:15.390 --> 05:33:15.400 align:start position:0%
process of getting buildings
 
05:33:17.910 --> 05:33:17.920 align:start position:0%
upgraded commercial property upgraded
 
05:33:19.750 --> 05:33:19.760 align:start position:0%
for Energy
 
05:33:23.230 --> 05:33:23.240 align:start position:0%
Efficiency the two previous attempts to
 
05:33:26.628 --> 05:33:26.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:29.230 --> 05:33:29.240 align:start position:0%
legislation while the passage of the
 
05:33:31.390 --> 05:33:31.400 align:start position:0%
legislation was successful the
 
05:33:34.948 --> 05:33:34.958 align:start position:0%
legislation itself did not work in
 
05:33:37.910 --> 05:33:37.920 align:start position:0%
practice the way it was expected to when
 
05:33:39.830 --> 05:33:39.840 align:start position:0%
it when it passed the
 
05:33:44.788 --> 05:33:44.798 align:start position:0%
legislature so this is a new attempt to
 
05:33:48.788 --> 05:33:48.798 align:start position:0%
get the C Pacer legislation to
 
05:33:52.270 --> 05:33:52.280 align:start position:0%
work and we've got a couple of folks
 
05:33:54.750 --> 05:33:54.760 align:start position:0%
here who are much more knowledgeable
 
05:33:59.070 --> 05:33:59.080 align:start position:0%
about this program than I am much more
 
05:34:03.430 --> 05:34:03.440 align:start position:0%
up todate on the latest Provisions
 
05:34:05.350 --> 05:34:05.360 align:start position:0%
within this legislation that will
 
05:34:08.190 --> 05:34:08.200 align:start position:0%
hopefully make it work so so I'm going
 
05:34:11.070 --> 05:34:11.080 align:start position:0%
to defer to them to explain to you
 
05:34:14.070 --> 05:34:14.080 align:start position:0%
exactly how the changes to this
 
05:34:17.270 --> 05:34:17.280 align:start position:0%
legislation will make it finally work
 
05:34:19.190 --> 05:34:19.200 align:start position:0%
and do the job that we want it to do
 
05:34:22.788 --> 05:34:22.798 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire which is to enable
 
05:34:24.990 --> 05:34:25.000 align:start position:0%
commercial buildings to be upgraded for
 
05:34:28.510 --> 05:34:28.520 align:start position:0%
Energy Efficiency in a way that is
 
05:34:32.270 --> 05:34:32.280 align:start position:0%
Affordable to those building
 
05:34:34.708 --> 05:34:34.718 align:start position:0%
owners I'll be happy to take questions
 
05:34:36.548 --> 05:34:36.558 align:start position:0%
if you want but I'm probably going to
 
05:34:39.948 --> 05:34:39.958 align:start position:0%
defer most of them to to other
 
05:34:42.910 --> 05:34:42.920 align:start position:0%
folks thank you representative are there
 
05:34:44.670 --> 05:34:44.680 align:start position:0%
any questions for the representative
 
05:34:47.030 --> 05:34:47.040 align:start position:0%
that he can defer to the people behind
 
05:34:47.040 --> 05:34:49.788 align:start position:0%
that he can defer to the people behind
them

05:34:49.788 --> 05:34:49.798 align:start position:0%
them
 
05:34:53.788 --> 05:34:53.798 align:start position:0%
yeah okay seeing no questions for the R
 
05:34:57.310 --> 05:34:57.320 align:start position:0%
thank you representative o and I will I
 
05:34:59.910 --> 05:34:59.920 align:start position:0%
will announce the next speaker will be
 
05:35:03.110 --> 05:35:03.120 align:start position:0%
Mr James kallis from the New Hampshire
 
05:35:18.910 --> 05:35:18.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:21.510 --> 05:35:21.520 align:start position:0%
there we go good afternoon uh for the
 
05:35:23.910 --> 05:35:23.920 align:start position:0%
record I'm James key Wallace I'm the
 
05:35:26.470 --> 05:35:26.480 align:start position:0%
executive director of the state's
 
05:35:28.948 --> 05:35:28.958 align:start position:0%
business Finance Authority uh thank you
 
05:35:31.150 --> 05:35:31.160 align:start position:0%
for having me today and uh thank you Mr
 
05:35:34.110 --> 05:35:34.120 align:start position:0%
chairman for introducing the bill uh so
 
05:35:36.990 --> 05:35:37.000 align:start position:0%
what I'd like to do is just say a few
 
05:35:39.788 --> 05:35:39.798 align:start position:0%
things about cace and why this latest
 
05:35:44.190 --> 05:35:44.200 align:start position:0%
iteration of cace came to the BFA um and
 
05:35:46.230 --> 05:35:46.240 align:start position:0%
then maybe just walk through what's in
 
05:35:47.910 --> 05:35:47.920 align:start position:0%
their proposal and I'm happy to of
 
05:35:51.470 --> 05:35:51.480 align:start position:0%
course answer any questions um so the
 
05:35:53.948 --> 05:35:53.958 align:start position:0%
the BFA has not been involved in any of
 
05:35:57.628 --> 05:35:57.638 align:start position:0%
the previous attempts for cace um
 
05:35:59.390 --> 05:35:59.400 align:start position:0%
they've all been very honorable and and
 
05:36:02.628 --> 05:36:02.638 align:start position:0%
I think semis successful attempts um and
 
05:36:04.708 --> 05:36:04.718 align:start position:0%
yet haven't really resulted in any
 
05:36:08.270 --> 05:36:08.280 align:start position:0%
actual lending in the state so so we
 
05:36:11.750 --> 05:36:11.760 align:start position:0%
were approached by both folks who make
 
05:36:14.030 --> 05:36:14.040 align:start position:0%
cace loans which by the way are all
 
05:36:17.070 --> 05:36:17.080 align:start position:0%
private Capital lenders and project
 
05:36:19.150 --> 05:36:19.160 align:start position:0%
owners which by the way are also all
 
05:36:21.510 --> 05:36:21.520 align:start position:0%
private project owners so this is
 
05:36:24.270 --> 05:36:24.280 align:start position:0%
private capital for private projects
 
05:36:26.910 --> 05:36:26.920 align:start position:0%
this is a voluntary program this does
 
05:36:29.548 --> 05:36:29.558 align:start position:0%
not impose any obligations on anyone to
 
05:36:31.910 --> 05:36:31.920 align:start position:0%
meet any particular standards the
 
05:36:35.030 --> 05:36:35.040 align:start position:0%
municipalities opt in if they want to so
 
05:36:36.830 --> 05:36:36.840 align:start position:0%
this is fully voluntary it doesn't cost
 
05:36:40.190 --> 05:36:40.200 align:start position:0%
the state or towns or anyone anything um
 
05:36:42.548 --> 05:36:42.558 align:start position:0%
so they approached us and said BFA you
 
05:36:44.708 --> 05:36:44.718 align:start position:0%
know lending and you know how to
 
05:36:47.430 --> 05:36:47.440 align:start position:0%
administer programs so can you take a
 
05:36:50.310 --> 05:36:50.320 align:start position:0%
look at the existing state statute make
 
05:36:53.830 --> 05:36:53.840 align:start position:0%
some recommendations and turn it into a
 
05:36:57.910 --> 05:36:57.920 align:start position:0%
potential Bill and that's what we did so
 
05:37:00.430 --> 05:37:00.440 align:start position:0%
the process that we went through was to
 
05:37:04.430 --> 05:37:04.440 align:start position:0%
evaluate the 20 plus 25 other active
 
05:37:06.548 --> 05:37:06.558 align:start position:0%
cpce programs around the country we
 
05:37:08.868 --> 05:37:08.878 align:start position:0%
didn't get get them all we just went and
 
05:37:10.390 --> 05:37:10.400 align:start position:0%
looked at what we thought were the good
 
05:37:13.590 --> 05:37:13.600 align:start position:0%
ones um it demonstrated by a high volume
 
05:37:15.590 --> 05:37:15.600 align:start position:0%
of lending said well what are you doing
 
05:37:17.750 --> 05:37:17.760 align:start position:0%
that we're not doing some of them are
 
05:37:19.628 --> 05:37:19.638 align:start position:0%
doing a good job some we think New
 
05:37:21.430 --> 05:37:21.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire could do a little better I
 
05:37:24.150 --> 05:37:24.160 align:start position:0%
won't name names but um so we took some
 
05:37:27.310 --> 05:37:27.320 align:start position:0%
best practices and we went to the
 
05:37:29.548 --> 05:37:29.558 align:start position:0%
different stakeholder groups such as the
 
05:37:31.788 --> 05:37:31.798 align:start position:0%
municipal Association the bankers
 
05:37:34.230 --> 05:37:34.240 align:start position:0%
Association project developers just the
 
05:37:35.910 --> 05:37:35.920 align:start position:0%
folks affected by the bill right and
 
05:37:38.670 --> 05:37:38.680 align:start position:0%
said how does this not work for you
 
05:37:42.190 --> 05:37:42.200 align:start position:0%
where are the sticking points developed
 
05:37:45.390 --> 05:37:45.400 align:start position:0%
this amend this proposed statutory
 
05:37:50.670 --> 05:37:50.680 align:start position:0%
change so what we found were a few kind
 
05:37:51.750 --> 05:37:51.760 align:start position:0%
of key
 
05:37:55.868 --> 05:37:55.878 align:start position:0%
things the existing statute had a number
 
05:37:59.670 --> 05:37:59.680 align:start position:0%
of seemingly minor but actually major
 
05:38:02.750 --> 05:38:02.760 align:start position:0%
technical problems and I'll give you
 
05:38:04.750 --> 05:38:04.760 align:start position:0%
just for you know one example of the
 
05:38:06.030 --> 05:38:06.040 align:start position:0%
many and I can give you as many as You'
 
05:38:09.350 --> 05:38:09.360 align:start position:0%
like the exist existing cpce statute
 
05:38:13.670 --> 05:38:13.680 align:start position:0%
says any cace lender needs to file a
 
05:38:16.830 --> 05:38:16.840 align:start position:0%
mortgage on the property which they're
 
05:38:19.190 --> 05:38:19.200 align:start position:0%
financing and I can give you a quick
 
05:38:20.830 --> 05:38:20.840 align:start position:0%
cpce primer in a moment actually if that
 
05:38:22.350 --> 05:38:22.360 align:start position:0%
would be helpful but one of the things
 
05:38:24.868 --> 05:38:24.878 align:start position:0%
that's unique about cace is it's in fact
 
05:38:27.350 --> 05:38:27.360 align:start position:0%
not a mortgage and so you had the
 
05:38:30.190 --> 05:38:30.200 align:start position:0%
statutory requirement right in plain
 
05:38:32.948 --> 05:38:32.958 align:start position:0%
language that immediately kind of
 
05:38:34.788 --> 05:38:34.798 align:start position:0%
prevented any cpce loan from going
 
05:38:37.510 --> 05:38:37.520 align:start position:0%
forward so you take that and you put
 
05:38:39.868 --> 05:38:39.878 align:start position:0%
that several times different things
 
05:38:41.310 --> 05:38:41.320 align:start position:0%
throughout the legislation and you've
 
05:38:44.468 --> 05:38:44.478 align:start position:0%
got the inability to actually make
 
05:38:50.110 --> 05:38:50.120 align:start position:0%
loans the second big thing was cace is a
 
05:38:52.868 --> 05:38:52.878 align:start position:0%
program where the municipalities are
 
05:38:54.468 --> 05:38:54.478 align:start position:0%
involved in some of the billing and
 
05:38:57.030 --> 05:38:57.040 align:start position:0%
administration of the program but it
 
05:38:59.310 --> 05:38:59.320 align:start position:0%
didn't provide municipalities with any
 
05:39:02.310 --> 05:39:02.320 align:start position:0%
support any guidance every municipality
 
05:39:04.270 --> 05:39:04.280 align:start position:0%
had to run their own program which would
 
05:39:08.190 --> 05:39:08.200 align:start position:0%
be expensive hard to do and especially
 
05:39:09.628 --> 05:39:09.638 align:start position:0%
some of our smaller communities said
 
05:39:10.788 --> 05:39:10.798 align:start position:0%
well this is burdensome we just
 
05:39:12.230 --> 05:39:12.240 align:start position:0%
literally don't know how to do this and
 
05:39:16.230 --> 05:39:16.240 align:start position:0%
we can't do it so it introduces the BFA
 
05:39:17.910 --> 05:39:17.920 align:start position:0%
this which what other states do as a
 
05:39:20.110 --> 05:39:20.120 align:start position:0%
central administrator which really is
 
05:39:22.190 --> 05:39:22.200 align:start position:0%
like a clerk of the works right you know
 
05:39:24.510 --> 05:39:24.520 align:start position:0%
form documents answer questions guide
 
05:39:26.788 --> 05:39:26.798 align:start position:0%
people through the process just help run
 
05:39:29.390 --> 05:39:29.400 align:start position:0%
checklists honestly um nothing
 
05:39:32.190 --> 05:39:32.200 align:start position:0%
particularly complex but um it's what
 
05:39:34.708 --> 05:39:34.718 align:start position:0%
you need to run a program so technical
 
05:39:37.990 --> 05:39:38.000 align:start position:0%
changes Central administrator role
 
05:39:40.350 --> 05:39:40.360 align:start position:0%
um those are the two things I'm happy to
 
05:39:42.190 --> 05:39:42.200 align:start position:0%
answer questions and I'm happy to kind
 
05:39:44.788 --> 05:39:44.798 align:start position:0%
of do a cpce 101 if that would be
 
05:39:49.030 --> 05:39:49.040 align:start position:0%
helpful for the committee thank
 
05:39:53.548 --> 05:39:53.558 align:start position:0%
you okay uh before we turn to questions
 
05:39:55.590 --> 05:39:55.600 align:start position:0%
I want to point out something that I
 
05:39:57.190 --> 05:39:57.200 align:start position:0%
probably should have said when I was
 
05:39:59.910 --> 05:39:59.920 align:start position:0%
introducing the bill that's relevant to
 
05:39:59.920 --> 05:40:01.390 align:start position:0%
introducing the bill that's relevant to
this

05:40:01.390 --> 05:40:01.400 align:start position:0%
this
 
05:40:06.190 --> 05:40:06.200 align:start position:0%
process the Senate has already passed
 
05:40:07.868 --> 05:40:07.878 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
05:40:09.830 --> 05:40:09.840 align:start position:0%
their version of The Bill had one line
 
05:40:12.430 --> 05:40:12.440 align:start position:0%
in it that this bill does not
 
05:40:15.990 --> 05:40:16.000 align:start position:0%
have and according to the speaker's
 
05:40:18.670 --> 05:40:18.680 align:start position:0%
office that is the preferred version of
 
05:40:18.680 --> 05:40:20.430 align:start position:0%
office that is the preferred version of
the

05:40:20.430 --> 05:40:20.440 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:40:24.070 --> 05:40:24.080 align:start position:0%
bill the Senate the full Senate is going
 
05:40:27.350 --> 05:40:27.360 align:start position:0%
to pass that bill either this Thursday
 
05:40:30.628 --> 05:40:30.638 align:start position:0%
or next Thursday I'm not entirely sure
 
05:40:32.350 --> 05:40:32.360 align:start position:0%
exactly when they're meeting but they're
 
05:40:34.590 --> 05:40:34.600 align:start position:0%
going to pass it within the next two
 
05:40:38.190 --> 05:40:38.200 align:start position:0%
weeks and the speak speaker's office is
 
05:40:39.948 --> 05:40:39.958 align:start position:0%
going to Fast
 
05:40:43.430 --> 05:40:43.440 align:start position:0%
Track that version of the bill through
 
05:40:46.030 --> 05:40:46.040 align:start position:0%
the house which means he's going to
 
05:40:48.468 --> 05:40:48.478 align:start position:0%
assign it to this committee so we're
 
05:40:51.910 --> 05:40:51.920 align:start position:0%
going to get this bill from the Senate
 
05:40:53.670 --> 05:40:53.680 align:start position:0%
and it'll be virtually identical to the
 
05:40:55.150 --> 05:40:55.160 align:start position:0%
one we're looking at right here except
 
05:40:58.830 --> 05:40:58.840 align:start position:0%
there will be one additional line added
 
05:41:03.468 --> 05:41:03.478 align:start position:0%
to it and at that time it is hoped by
 
05:41:06.030 --> 05:41:06.040 align:start position:0%
the speaker's office that we will pass
 
05:41:08.030 --> 05:41:08.040 align:start position:0%
the Senate version of the
 
05:41:12.070 --> 05:41:12.080 align:start position:0%
bill and if we do that then the bill can
 
05:41:14.750 --> 05:41:14.760 align:start position:0%
be enrolled and sent to the governor so
 
05:41:18.150 --> 05:41:18.160 align:start position:0%
that it can um take
 
05:41:21.548 --> 05:41:21.558 align:start position:0%
effect in the very near future so
 
05:41:24.350 --> 05:41:24.360 align:start position:0%
that the program can be
 
05:41:24.360 --> 05:41:26.270 align:start position:0%
that the program can be
administered

05:41:26.270 --> 05:41:26.280 align:start position:0%
administered
 
05:41:30.670 --> 05:41:30.680 align:start position:0%
Statewide so uh given that uh
 
05:41:33.110 --> 05:41:33.120 align:start position:0%
reality I wanted you to understand that
 
05:41:35.670 --> 05:41:35.680 align:start position:0%
reality as you tried to form your
 
05:41:38.708 --> 05:41:38.718 align:start position:0%
questions um for the gentleman who will
 
05:41:40.548 --> 05:41:40.558 align:start position:0%
be speaking here this morning or this
 
05:41:43.468 --> 05:41:43.478 align:start position:0%
afternoon representative Wendy Thomas
 
05:41:46.350 --> 05:41:46.360 align:start position:0%
thank you um Mr chair and I I realize
 
05:41:48.310 --> 05:41:48.320 align:start position:0%
you introduced the bill so there might
 
05:41:49.868 --> 05:41:49.878 align:start position:0%
be some conflict with you answering
 
05:41:52.990 --> 05:41:53.000 align:start position:0%
questions but um can you let us know
 
05:41:55.510 --> 05:41:55.520 align:start position:0%
what that one line is and what it
 
05:41:57.990 --> 05:41:58.000 align:start position:0%
says when I find out what it is I will
 
05:42:00.830 --> 05:42:00.840 align:start position:0%
be happy to let you know thank you I I
 
05:42:02.868 --> 05:42:02.878 align:start position:0%
don't know off the top of my head maybe
 
05:42:06.468 --> 05:42:06.478 align:start position:0%
Mr Sam Evans Brown knows I I I know Mr
 
05:42:09.150 --> 05:42:09.160 align:start position:0%
chairman if be helpful well here we go
 
05:42:12.750 --> 05:42:12.760 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you very much so there are uh
 
05:42:17.670 --> 05:42:17.680 align:start position:0%
two what I would consider um two
 
05:42:20.230 --> 05:42:20.240 align:start position:0%
changes um let me pull it out so I can
 
05:42:22.628 --> 05:42:22.638 align:start position:0%
actually give you the exact reference
 
05:42:24.030 --> 05:42:24.040 align:start position:0%
one I would call a
 
05:42:29.110 --> 05:42:29.120 align:start position:0%
typo um and one I would call a
 
05:42:29.120 --> 05:42:31.510 align:start position:0%
typo um and one I would call a
clarification

05:42:31.510 --> 05:42:31.520 align:start position:0%
clarification
 
05:42:35.070 --> 05:42:35.080 align:start position:0%
so on the top of page
 
05:42:37.708 --> 05:42:37.718 align:start position:0%
five at the
 
05:42:40.590 --> 05:42:40.600 align:start position:0%
end of sentence one and the beginning of
 
05:42:44.750 --> 05:42:44.760 align:start position:0%
sentence two you'll see the word owners
 
05:42:48.230 --> 05:42:48.240 align:start position:0%
with no apostrophe crossed out and the
 
05:42:53.070 --> 05:42:53.080 align:start position:0%
word owners with an apostrophe added so
 
05:42:55.628 --> 05:42:55.638 align:start position:0%
that that is incorrect um and it
 
05:42:57.750 --> 05:42:57.760 align:start position:0%
actually matters because it's speaking
 
05:43:01.910 --> 05:43:01.920 align:start position:0%
to what the Senate bill says is it's on
 
05:43:04.510 --> 05:43:04.520 align:start position:0%
line one enter into agreements with
 
05:43:08.750 --> 05:43:08.760 align:start position:0%
owners of eligible property the of which
 
05:43:11.868 --> 05:43:11.878 align:start position:0%
the owners have consented right because
 
05:43:14.070 --> 05:43:14.080 align:start position:0%
there's often multiple so I consider
 
05:43:16.390 --> 05:43:16.400 align:start position:0%
that it's a typo
 
05:43:20.190 --> 05:43:20.200 align:start position:0%
right uh actually no apostrophe
 
05:43:22.628 --> 05:43:22.638 align:start position:0%
it's and so the language in the Senate
 
05:43:26.150 --> 05:43:26.160 align:start position:0%
says in which the owners have consented
 
05:43:29.310 --> 05:43:29.320 align:start position:0%
right so that's like a okay right so the
 
05:43:34.310 --> 05:43:34.320 align:start position:0%
more um I think interesting one and is
 
05:43:39.868 --> 05:43:39.878 align:start position:0%
uh on Page Six line uh starting on line
 
05:43:42.390 --> 05:43:42.400 align:start position:0%
24 and this is what I would call a
 
05:43:45.868 --> 05:43:45.878 align:start position:0%
clarification so this this clarifies
 
05:43:47.788 --> 05:43:47.798 align:start position:0%
okay so let me back up so the the way
 
05:43:50.990 --> 05:43:51.000 align:start position:0%
this program runs is businesses or
 
05:43:54.628 --> 05:43:54.638 align:start position:0%
Housing Development apply for cace right
 
05:43:57.230 --> 05:43:57.240 align:start position:0%
and part of what gets supplied as an
 
05:44:01.390 --> 05:44:01.400 align:start position:0%
application for a loan are confidential
 
05:44:04.110 --> 05:44:04.120 align:start position:0%
business financial statements personal
 
05:44:06.230 --> 05:44:06.240 align:start position:0%
financial statements all type of
 
05:44:07.868 --> 05:44:07.878 align:start position:0%
sensitive information
 
05:44:10.110 --> 05:44:10.120 align:start position:0%
that if you look at the bfa's existing
 
05:44:12.430 --> 05:44:12.440 align:start position:0%
exemptions under 91a are exempt from
 
05:44:14.430 --> 05:44:14.440 align:start position:0%
disclosure because no one's going to
 
05:44:16.070 --> 05:44:16.080 align:start position:0%
apply if they think you know your
 
05:44:17.708 --> 05:44:17.718 align:start position:0%
business's financial statements are now
 
05:44:20.110 --> 05:44:20.120 align:start position:0%
available to your competitors so the
 
05:44:21.788 --> 05:44:21.798 align:start position:0%
house version on that paragraph
 
05:44:24.830 --> 05:44:24.840 align:start position:0%
beginning on N uh line 24 page
 
05:44:27.468 --> 05:44:27.478 align:start position:0%
six labels that information as
 
05:44:29.990 --> 05:44:30.000 align:start position:0%
confidential information the Senate
 
05:44:33.070 --> 05:44:33.080 align:start position:0%
version does the same but also
 
05:44:36.350 --> 05:44:36.360 align:start position:0%
specifically references the exemption
 
05:44:39.468 --> 05:44:39.478 align:start position:0%
clause in 91a for the removal of any
 
05:44:42.628 --> 05:44:42.638 align:start position:0%
doubt as to the confidentiality of that
 
05:44:45.990 --> 05:44:46.000 align:start position:0%
information so those are the two things
 
05:44:51.868 --> 05:44:51.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:55.750 --> 05:44:55.760 align:start position:0%
identical okay great uh does anybody
 
05:44:58.070 --> 05:44:58.080 align:start position:0%
have any questions representative rolds
 
05:45:00.750 --> 05:45:00.760 align:start position:0%
I do thank you Mr chairman um thanks for
 
05:45:04.270 --> 05:45:04.280 align:start position:0%
being here today uh Could you um you
 
05:45:08.030 --> 05:45:08.040 align:start position:0%
know this might be uh an entree
 
05:45:09.750 --> 05:45:09.760 align:start position:0%
or an opening for you to for you to give
 
05:45:14.110 --> 05:45:14.120 align:start position:0%
that that P cpce 101 if if you want but
 
05:45:15.948 --> 05:45:15.958 align:start position:0%
I just was just wondering if you could
 
05:45:19.070 --> 05:45:19.080 align:start position:0%
offer for you know everyone on the
 
05:45:22.230 --> 05:45:22.240 align:start position:0%
committee's uh illumination the
 
05:45:26.948 --> 05:45:26.958 align:start position:0%
rationale for this whole concept of a
 
05:45:26.958 --> 05:45:27.948 align:start position:0%
rationale for this whole concept of a
special

05:45:27.948 --> 05:45:27.958 align:start position:0%
special
 
05:45:30.030 --> 05:45:30.040 align:start position:0%
assessment for
 
05:45:32.548 --> 05:45:32.558 align:start position:0%
financing Energy Efficiency improvements
 
05:45:35.788 --> 05:45:35.798 align:start position:0%
to buildings why why is this thing
 
05:45:38.030 --> 05:45:38.040 align:start position:0%
necessary and why have we been trying
 
05:45:40.468 --> 05:45:40.478 align:start position:0%
for several years to get it enacted here
 
05:45:41.390 --> 05:45:41.400 align:start position:0%
in New
 
05:45:43.590 --> 05:45:43.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire happy to representative right
 
05:45:44.830 --> 05:45:44.840 align:start position:0%
where where's the beef right like what's
 
05:45:49.830 --> 05:45:49.840 align:start position:0%
this all about yeah right so uh so cace
 
05:45:52.990 --> 05:45:53.000 align:start position:0%
is commercial property assessed clean
 
05:45:55.190 --> 05:45:55.200 align:start position:0%
energy although it's a little broader
 
05:46:00.190 --> 05:46:00.200 align:start position:0%
than that but um what cace is is it's a
 
05:46:02.788 --> 05:46:02.798 align:start position:0%
lending program where a private lender a
 
05:46:05.910 --> 05:46:05.920 align:start position:0%
bank or CPA specialized lender um
 
05:46:08.510 --> 05:46:08.520 align:start position:0%
they're all over the country can say
 
05:46:12.030 --> 05:46:12.040 align:start position:0%
Okay representative you are you know
 
05:46:13.708 --> 05:46:13.718 align:start position:0%
fixing the drafty windows in your
 
05:46:15.350 --> 05:46:15.360 align:start position:0%
building because it's going to save you
 
05:46:18.788 --> 05:46:18.798 align:start position:0%
money and blah blah blah blah blah
 
05:46:22.070 --> 05:46:22.080 align:start position:0%
right correct yeah so
 
05:46:23.788 --> 05:46:23.798 align:start position:0%
commercial could be an apartment
 
05:46:25.390 --> 05:46:25.400 align:start position:0%
building so it's any kind of commercial
 
05:46:28.510 --> 05:46:28.520 align:start position:0%
industrial or multif family residential
 
05:46:30.948 --> 05:46:30.958 align:start position:0%
five units or more is considered uh
 
05:46:32.548 --> 05:46:32.558 align:start position:0%
commercial under New Hampshire law right
 
05:46:36.230 --> 05:46:36.240 align:start position:0%
so um so you want to do that so one
 
05:46:37.750 --> 05:46:37.760 align:start position:0%
option is
 
05:46:39.868 --> 05:46:39.878 align:start position:0%
you get the loan right we make you the
 
05:46:41.590 --> 05:46:41.600 align:start position:0%
loan pretend I'm the bank I make you the
 
05:46:44.548 --> 05:46:44.558 align:start position:0%
loan you write your monthly check like
 
05:46:48.910 --> 05:46:48.920 align:start position:0%
you pay any loan that can be fine there
 
05:46:53.628 --> 05:46:53.638 align:start position:0%
are certain times where the payback
 
05:46:56.110 --> 05:46:56.120 align:start position:0%
period of the energy investment maybe
 
05:46:59.030 --> 05:46:59.040 align:start position:0%
it's an 11-year payback it makes sense
 
05:47:02.868 --> 05:47:02.878 align:start position:0%
to do um but the time in which the loan
 
05:47:05.750 --> 05:47:05.760 align:start position:0%
needs to get repaid is longer than what
 
05:47:08.150 --> 05:47:08.160 align:start position:0%
a normal loan they might say well let's
 
05:47:09.750 --> 05:47:09.760 align:start position:0%
look at your collateral let's look at
 
05:47:11.708 --> 05:47:11.718 align:start position:0%
this I can only offer you a loan that
 
05:47:14.270 --> 05:47:14.280 align:start position:0%
you pay back over 5 years but it kind of
 
05:47:17.590 --> 05:47:17.600 align:start position:0%
takes 11 years to you know but stretch
 
05:47:20.110 --> 05:47:20.120 align:start position:0%
that loan out so the payments match the
 
05:47:23.990 --> 05:47:24.000 align:start position:0%
savings that's pretty common in you know
 
05:47:26.310 --> 05:47:26.320 align:start position:0%
efficiency uh investments in a building
 
05:47:28.150 --> 05:47:28.160 align:start position:0%
right they're they're long-term a lot of
 
05:47:31.788 --> 05:47:31.798 align:start position:0%
the time so what cace allows A lender to
 
05:47:35.750 --> 05:47:35.760 align:start position:0%
do is instead of getting paid back via
 
05:47:38.670 --> 05:47:38.680 align:start position:0%
their monthly check you write you are
 
05:47:42.390 --> 05:47:42.400 align:start position:0%
actually paid back as the lender via
 
05:47:44.868 --> 05:47:44.878 align:start position:0%
your payments you make on your property
 
05:47:47.430 --> 05:47:47.440 align:start position:0%
tax bill for the property so it's not in
 
05:47:49.030 --> 05:47:49.040 align:start position:0%
lie of your other property taxes the
 
05:47:50.830 --> 05:47:50.840 align:start position:0%
town still gets paid all everything they
 
05:47:53.548 --> 05:47:53.558 align:start position:0%
get they get paid but you get a new line
 
05:47:56.270 --> 05:47:56.280 align:start position:0%
item on your tax bill that's equal to
 
05:47:58.830 --> 05:47:58.840 align:start position:0%
the payments and that does some actually
 
05:48:00.788 --> 05:48:00.798 align:start position:0%
some pretty interesting things if you're
 
05:48:03.990 --> 05:48:04.000 align:start position:0%
a lender you know one is it increases
 
05:48:07.030 --> 05:48:07.040 align:start position:0%
the security position of that loan
 
05:48:09.788 --> 05:48:09.798 align:start position:0%
because if the building is sold or you
 
05:48:12.030 --> 05:48:12.040 align:start position:0%
go out of business or you foreclose or
 
05:48:14.910 --> 05:48:14.920 align:start position:0%
whatever some things go wrong whoever
 
05:48:16.708 --> 05:48:16.718 align:start position:0%
comes into that building and buys it
 
05:48:16.718 --> 05:48:17.750 align:start position:0%
comes into that building and buys it
after

05:48:17.750 --> 05:48:17.760 align:start position:0%
after
 
05:48:21.230 --> 05:48:21.240 align:start position:0%
you gets that same line item so as long
 
05:48:23.868 --> 05:48:23.878 align:start position:0%
as someone's in the building and they're
 
05:48:27.150 --> 05:48:27.160 align:start position:0%
paying their taxes that lender cpce loan
 
05:48:29.670 --> 05:48:29.680 align:start position:0%
is eventually going to get paid I mean
 
05:48:30.948 --> 05:48:30.958 align:start position:0%
they're only going to they they sign up
 
05:48:32.390 --> 05:48:32.400 align:start position:0%
for that when they buy it right so it's
 
05:48:34.670 --> 05:48:34.680 align:start position:0%
full consent and awareness it's this is
 
05:48:36.910 --> 05:48:36.920 align:start position:0%
an informed kind of private Market
 
05:48:39.750 --> 05:48:39.760 align:start position:0%
transaction but it helps the cpce folks
 
05:48:43.270 --> 05:48:43.280 align:start position:0%
know I'll get paid one day and that lets
 
05:48:45.948 --> 05:48:45.958 align:start position:0%
them take have more patience in how long
 
05:48:48.350 --> 05:48:48.360 align:start position:0%
they get paid so they can match up the
 
05:48:50.708 --> 05:48:50.718 align:start position:0%
savings of the project to the monthly
 
05:48:53.070 --> 05:48:53.080 align:start position:0%
payments and there's sort of this Niche
 
05:48:56.670 --> 05:48:56.680 align:start position:0%
window of projects that will apply to
 
05:48:58.270 --> 05:48:58.280 align:start position:0%
people are excited about this developers
 
05:48:59.310 --> 05:48:59.320 align:start position:0%
are excited
 
05:49:01.750 --> 05:49:01.760 align:start position:0%
lenders I'm a little more measured in
 
05:49:03.868 --> 05:49:03.878 align:start position:0%
what I think it will do I think this is
 
05:49:06.150 --> 05:49:06.160 align:start position:0%
just one tool in the toolbox I think
 
05:49:07.350 --> 05:49:07.360 align:start position:0%
it's helpful
 
05:49:09.830 --> 05:49:09.840 align:start position:0%
we'll definitely see projects it's not a
 
05:49:13.510 --> 05:49:13.520 align:start position:0%
light the world on fire Silver Bullet um
 
05:49:16.510 --> 05:49:16.520 align:start position:0%
but it's helpful when it's it's
 
05:49:21.270 --> 05:49:21.280 align:start position:0%
helpful yes thank you Mr chairman um in
 
05:49:23.510 --> 05:49:23.520 align:start position:0%
the world of you know building uh
 
05:49:27.150 --> 05:49:27.160 align:start position:0%
Renovations and um Energy Efficiency
 
05:49:29.230 --> 05:49:29.240 align:start position:0%
upgrades you know
 
05:49:33.430 --> 05:49:33.440 align:start position:0%
windows and uh things like furnaces are
 
05:49:36.750 --> 05:49:36.760 align:start position:0%
um high efficiency furnaces are
 
05:49:39.270 --> 05:49:39.280 align:start position:0%
good examples of things where the
 
05:49:43.868 --> 05:49:43.878 align:start position:0%
efficiency upgrade has a long payback
 
05:49:47.190 --> 05:49:47.200 align:start position:0%
and uh owners which is to say landlords
 
05:49:49.948 --> 05:49:49.958 align:start position:0%
owners of buildings who have all their
 
05:49:52.868 --> 05:49:52.878 align:start position:0%
paying tenants are often reluctant to
 
05:49:55.990 --> 05:49:56.000 align:start position:0%
make those Investments right so is this
 
05:49:58.868 --> 05:49:58.878 align:start position:0%
tool also intended
 
05:50:03.590 --> 05:50:03.600 align:start position:0%
to um facilitate or you know take reduce
 
05:50:07.190 --> 05:50:07.200 align:start position:0%
the risk uh for for owners of buildings
 
05:50:10.788 --> 05:50:10.798 align:start position:0%
to or just say incentivize them to make
 
05:50:13.548 --> 05:50:13.558 align:start position:0%
those kinds of efficiency upgrades that
 
05:50:15.350 --> 05:50:15.360 align:start position:0%
they might not otherwise make because
 
05:50:17.030 --> 05:50:17.040 align:start position:0%
they have such a long payback and if
 
05:50:18.350 --> 05:50:18.360 align:start position:0%
they sell the building they're not going
 
05:50:21.350 --> 05:50:21.360 align:start position:0%
to get that return necessarily but now
 
05:50:23.948 --> 05:50:23.958 align:start position:0%
the loan that the loan goes with the
 
05:50:26.788 --> 05:50:26.798 align:start position:0%
building as opposed to being with the
 
05:50:29.270 --> 05:50:29.280 align:start position:0%
owner yes representative I don't think I
 
05:50:30.910 --> 05:50:30.920 align:start position:0%
could have said it better that's exactly
 
05:50:33.910 --> 05:50:33.920 align:start position:0%
what happens uh people say boy I'd love
 
05:50:35.310 --> 05:50:35.320 align:start position:0%
to do this but I don't know if I'll own
 
05:50:37.868 --> 05:50:37.878 align:start position:0%
this building for 15 years right now
 
05:50:40.350 --> 05:50:40.360 align:start position:0%
they can do it the savings are generated
 
05:50:42.948 --> 05:50:42.958 align:start position:0%
everyone benefits and they don't have to
 
05:50:45.548 --> 05:50:45.558 align:start position:0%
own the building for 15 years and the
 
05:50:47.230 --> 05:50:47.240 align:start position:0%
project can still go forward and their
 
05:50:50.030 --> 05:50:50.040 align:start position:0%
tenants though continue to benefit from
 
05:50:51.868 --> 05:50:51.878 align:start position:0%
absolutely that's exactly right yes
 
05:50:55.230 --> 05:50:55.240 align:start position:0%
thank you reper Vice chair Thomas thank
 
05:50:57.350 --> 05:50:57.360 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman thank you for taking my
 
05:51:00.788 --> 05:51:00.798 align:start position:0%
question just a curiosity question uh
 
05:51:03.468 --> 05:51:03.478 align:start position:0%
does this program would commercial
 
05:51:05.990 --> 05:51:06.000 align:start position:0%
owners be eligible for this program even
 
05:51:07.990 --> 05:51:08.000 align:start position:0%
if they took a advantage of other
 
05:51:09.910 --> 05:51:09.920 align:start position:0%
efficiency programs like New Hampshire
 
05:51:12.628 --> 05:51:12.638 align:start position:0%
saves or things like that uh thank you
 
05:51:14.590 --> 05:51:14.600 align:start position:0%
Mr Vice chair great question the answer
 
05:51:17.628 --> 05:51:17.638 align:start position:0%
is yes um this is a private lending
 
05:51:20.788 --> 05:51:20.798 align:start position:0%
program that if you as a private
 
05:51:22.910 --> 05:51:22.920 align:start position:0%
property owner can convince A lender
 
05:51:24.750 --> 05:51:24.760 align:start position:0%
you're a good credit risk and the nature
 
05:51:26.830 --> 05:51:26.840 align:start position:0%
of the Improvement fits within the
 
05:51:30.830 --> 05:51:30.840 align:start position:0%
definition of c Pacer um which is uh you
 
05:51:34.750 --> 05:51:34.760 align:start position:0%
know energy focused but flexible um then
 
05:51:37.670 --> 05:51:37.680 align:start position:0%
sure yeah it doesn't have any kind of
 
05:51:38.868 --> 05:51:38.878 align:start position:0%
you know you can only do this on
 
05:51:41.270 --> 05:51:41.280 align:start position:0%
Thursdays but not Fridays and that kind
 
05:51:42.910 --> 05:51:42.920 align:start position:0%
of stuff you
 
05:51:45.830 --> 05:51:45.840 align:start position:0%
know representative Wendy Thomas thank
 
05:51:49.070 --> 05:51:49.080 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair um and this is a question
 
05:51:52.270 --> 05:51:52.280 align:start position:0%
on what you have just explained um you
 
05:51:54.430 --> 05:51:54.440 align:start position:0%
talked about the line item on the
 
05:51:57.430 --> 05:51:57.440 align:start position:0%
property taxes is there a percentage cap
 
05:51:59.708 --> 05:51:59.718 align:start position:0%
for that
 
05:52:04.670 --> 05:52:04.680 align:start position:0%
um or can it be I mean how how do we how
 
05:52:07.110 --> 05:52:07.120 align:start position:0%
is that established and what is is the
 
05:52:09.310 --> 05:52:09.320 align:start position:0%
the maximum amount that one is allowed
 
05:52:09.320 --> 05:52:10.750 align:start position:0%
the maximum amount that one is allowed
to

05:52:10.750 --> 05:52:10.760 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:52:14.190 --> 05:52:14.200 align:start position:0%
borrow great question so that would be
 
05:52:19.510 --> 05:52:19.520 align:start position:0%
set really by two simultaneous parties
 
05:52:21.830 --> 05:52:21.840 align:start position:0%
right one would be whoever is deciding
 
05:52:24.310 --> 05:52:24.320 align:start position:0%
to lend the money to the project they
 
05:52:26.430 --> 05:52:26.440 align:start position:0%
have to decide this project can support
 
05:52:28.510 --> 05:52:28.520 align:start position:0%
it right and they look at the cash flow
 
05:52:31.190 --> 05:52:31.200 align:start position:0%
and they make a decision on is this a
 
05:52:34.350 --> 05:52:34.360 align:start position:0%
creditworthy situation the other equally
 
05:52:37.070 --> 05:52:37.080 align:start position:0%
important party is any exist in mortgage
 
05:52:39.750 --> 05:52:39.760 align:start position:0%
holder so you know most properties you
 
05:52:42.310 --> 05:52:42.320 align:start position:0%
finance to build to begin with and one
 
05:52:46.110 --> 05:52:46.120 align:start position:0%
of the important elements of this bill
 
05:52:48.510 --> 05:52:48.520 align:start position:0%
is that it requires the consent of any
 
05:52:50.948 --> 05:52:50.958 align:start position:0%
existing say Bank who has a mortgage
 
05:52:54.070 --> 05:52:54.080 align:start position:0%
holder that way they've made a loan and
 
05:52:55.990 --> 05:52:56.000 align:start position:0%
already just to like build the place
 
05:52:57.868 --> 05:52:57.878 align:start position:0%
right and they don't want it turned
 
05:52:59.910 --> 05:52:59.920 align:start position:0%
upside down so they they have the
 
05:53:01.590 --> 05:53:01.600 align:start position:0%
ability to consent to the additional
 
05:53:05.150 --> 05:53:05.160 align:start position:0%
indebtedness excellent thank
 
05:53:07.670 --> 05:53:07.680 align:start position:0%
you okay representative Corman has a
 
05:53:09.910 --> 05:53:09.920 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
05:53:12.468 --> 05:53:12.478 align:start position:0%
you so much for explaining this I I read
 
05:53:14.310 --> 05:53:14.320 align:start position:0%
this a few days ago and it just has
 
05:53:18.590 --> 05:53:18.600 align:start position:0%
completely gone out of my head so um how
 
05:53:20.910 --> 05:53:20.920 align:start position:0%
is the municipality involved other than
 
05:53:24.230 --> 05:53:24.240 align:start position:0%
being the one that is um doing the
 
05:53:25.948 --> 05:53:25.958 align:start position:0%
property tax and presumably taking the
 
05:53:28.270 --> 05:53:28.280 align:start position:0%
money and then bringing it over to the
 
05:53:30.548 --> 05:53:30.558 align:start position:0%
lender uh what does the municipality
 
05:53:31.430 --> 05:53:31.440 align:start position:0%
have to
 
05:53:34.430 --> 05:53:34.440 align:start position:0%
do so under current law they have to do
 
05:53:36.910 --> 05:53:36.920 align:start position:0%
that as well as develop all the the loan
 
05:53:38.868 --> 05:53:38.878 align:start position:0%
documents vet the
 
05:53:41.270 --> 05:53:41.280 align:start position:0%
contractors administer the program vet
 
05:53:43.350 --> 05:53:43.360 align:start position:0%
the lenders it's just it kind of
 
05:53:44.750 --> 05:53:44.760 align:start position:0%
something you need a fairly large
 
05:53:48.270 --> 05:53:48.280 align:start position:0%
apparatus to do Under the new proposal
 
05:53:50.868 --> 05:53:50.878 align:start position:0%
um they are responsible if they so
 
05:53:53.150 --> 05:53:53.160 align:start position:0%
choose for the billing that you
 
05:53:55.230 --> 05:53:55.240 align:start position:0%
mentioned right they just on their
 
05:53:57.868 --> 05:53:57.878 align:start position:0%
property tax bill um they do have to
 
05:53:59.628 --> 05:53:59.638 align:start position:0%
record the mortgage and the like there's
 
05:54:01.468 --> 05:54:01.478 align:start position:0%
a there's not a mortgage like the
 
05:54:04.110 --> 05:54:04.120 align:start position:0%
assessment gets recorded it's a recorded
 
05:54:07.030 --> 05:54:07.040 align:start position:0%
instrument of record um but the
 
05:54:09.868 --> 05:54:09.878 align:start position:0%
municipality has the option if they want
 
05:54:11.990 --> 05:54:12.000 align:start position:0%
to do it thems because it doesn't take
 
05:54:14.628 --> 05:54:14.638 align:start position:0%
anything away from them um but they have
 
05:54:17.390 --> 05:54:17.400 align:start position:0%
the option to delegate that to a third
 
05:54:19.750 --> 05:54:19.760 align:start position:0%
party which is how almost every town
 
05:54:21.468 --> 05:54:21.478 align:start position:0%
that does cpce anywhere in the country
 
05:54:24.430 --> 05:54:24.440 align:start position:0%
does it and the most common example of
 
05:54:26.230 --> 05:54:26.240 align:start position:0%
how that works is actually the same
 
05:54:27.430 --> 05:54:27.440 align:start position:0%
thing when you pay your personal
 
05:54:29.310 --> 05:54:29.320 align:start position:0%
mortgage right you have your property
 
05:54:31.150 --> 05:54:31.160 align:start position:0%
taxes that are owed to the town you
 
05:54:33.708 --> 05:54:33.718 align:start position:0%
don't usually cut two checks one to your
 
05:54:35.910 --> 05:54:35.920 align:start position:0%
lender one to the town you you pay your
 
05:54:38.590 --> 05:54:38.600 align:start position:0%
bank there's an escrow and then that
 
05:54:41.670 --> 05:54:41.680 align:start position:0%
escrow account is periodically released
 
05:54:43.708 --> 05:54:43.718 align:start position:0%
um to the towns and you know to your
 
05:54:45.628 --> 05:54:45.638 align:start position:0%
insurance company and stuff like that so
 
05:54:48.548 --> 05:54:48.558 align:start position:0%
that's typically actually how this is
 
05:54:53.030 --> 05:54:53.040 align:start position:0%
done follow up and do I I think I recall
 
05:54:54.548 --> 05:54:54.558 align:start position:0%
reading something about districts so are
 
05:54:56.310 --> 05:54:56.320 align:start position:0%
there districts carved out for this how
 
05:54:59.468 --> 05:54:59.478 align:start position:0%
does that work yeah great great question
 
05:55:03.030 --> 05:55:03.040 align:start position:0%
so in order for a project to be eligible
 
05:55:05.868 --> 05:55:05.878 align:start position:0%
for C paace because this is a it's
 
05:55:08.708 --> 05:55:08.718 align:start position:0%
technically a municipal lean even though
 
05:55:12.670 --> 05:55:12.680 align:start position:0%
it's a special kind of lean um the town
 
05:55:15.788 --> 05:55:15.798 align:start position:0%
has to create a district in which those
 
05:55:19.070 --> 05:55:19.080 align:start position:0%
leans can be placed so the town or city
 
05:55:22.110 --> 05:55:22.120 align:start position:0%
needs to opt in to the program and draw
 
05:55:24.990 --> 05:55:25.000 align:start position:0%
a circle in their borders and say this
 
05:55:27.990 --> 05:55:28.000 align:start position:0%
is where cace can happen most
 
05:55:29.868 --> 05:55:29.878 align:start position:0%
municipalities and states that run these
 
05:55:32.390 --> 05:55:32.400 align:start position:0%
programs adopted as a blanket corner to
 
05:55:36.640 --> 05:55:36.650 align:start position:0%
corner rule um there's not a particular
 
05:55:36.650 --> 05:55:38.270 align:start position:0%
corner rule um there's not a particular
[Music]

05:55:38.270 --> 05:55:38.280 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
05:55:40.430 --> 05:55:40.440 align:start position:0%
reason why you'd say only over here and
 
05:55:44.390 --> 05:55:44.400 align:start position:0%
not over over there um because there's
 
05:55:47.430 --> 05:55:47.440 align:start position:0%
not a lot of downside to them adopting
 
05:55:50.948 --> 05:55:50.958 align:start position:0%
it yes sir Vice chair Thomas has another
 
05:55:53.190 --> 05:55:53.200 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair I'll use up
 
05:55:56.708 --> 05:55:56.718 align:start position:0%
my follow on question to just again a
 
05:56:00.030 --> 05:56:00.040 align:start position:0%
curiosity so the town adopts the program
 
05:56:02.190 --> 05:56:02.200 align:start position:0%
is this by way of just their selectman
 
05:56:04.350 --> 05:56:04.360 align:start position:0%
or Town Council voting on it or is this
 
05:56:06.510 --> 05:56:06.520 align:start position:0%
something that has to be brought before
 
05:56:08.390 --> 05:56:08.400 align:start position:0%
the town people in the form of a
 
05:56:11.070 --> 05:56:11.080 align:start position:0%
warrant that's a great question I I
 
05:56:14.030 --> 05:56:14.040 align:start position:0%
think it actually depends on the town's
 
05:56:16.270 --> 05:56:16.280 align:start position:0%
setup right I think some towns have
 
05:56:18.708 --> 05:56:18.718 align:start position:0%
Alderman or cities and you know C
 
05:56:20.270 --> 05:56:20.280 align:start position:0%
they're empowered to do certain votes
 
05:56:22.270 --> 05:56:22.280 align:start position:0%
some have to go to town meeting you know
 
05:56:24.670 --> 05:56:24.680 align:start position:0%
some are I forget the term I I think the
 
05:56:26.910 --> 05:56:26.920 align:start position:0%
municipal associations here is probably
 
05:56:28.548 --> 05:56:28.558 align:start position:0%
saying you know this is an easy question
 
05:56:30.590 --> 05:56:30.600 align:start position:0%
but I actually don't know it um you know
 
05:56:33.910 --> 05:56:33.920 align:start position:0%
some of like Selectmen and hybrid so I
 
05:56:36.910 --> 05:56:36.920 align:start position:0%
think it whatever the town has to do to
 
05:56:39.070 --> 05:56:39.080 align:start position:0%
create taxing districts according to
 
05:56:41.910 --> 05:56:41.920 align:start position:0%
what the town is set up they have to do
 
05:56:44.788 --> 05:56:44.798 align:start position:0%
and that's probably not a great answer
 
05:56:46.910 --> 05:56:46.920 align:start position:0%
representative schneller has a
 
05:56:49.948 --> 05:56:49.958 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chairman um thank
 
05:56:52.310 --> 05:56:52.320 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question yes sir uh my
 
05:56:55.350 --> 05:56:55.360 align:start position:0%
original question was going to be why is
 
05:56:57.628 --> 05:56:57.638 align:start position:0%
there such legislative Firepower
 
05:57:00.030 --> 05:57:00.040 align:start position:0%
attached to this particular piece of
 
05:57:03.350 --> 05:57:03.360 align:start position:0%
legislation just looking at this and um
 
05:57:05.390 --> 05:57:05.400 align:start position:0%
then after you've explained it it's it's
 
05:57:08.788 --> 05:57:08.798 align:start position:0%
very clear there's very Innovative um so
 
05:57:12.430 --> 05:57:12.440 align:start position:0%
my next question only marginally Germain
 
05:57:16.190 --> 05:57:16.200 align:start position:0%
is what if the property is
 
05:57:19.868 --> 05:57:19.878 align:start position:0%
refinanced how does that flow
 
05:57:23.670 --> 05:57:23.680 align:start position:0%
through uh the tax bill really
 
05:57:27.110 --> 05:57:27.120 align:start position:0%
ultimately great great question um I I
 
05:57:29.070 --> 05:57:29.080 align:start position:0%
think I think there might be you know a
 
05:57:30.510 --> 05:57:30.520 align:start position:0%
one and a onea there so I think the
 
05:57:32.788 --> 05:57:32.798 align:start position:0%
Firepower is because of the recognition
 
05:57:34.868 --> 05:57:34.878 align:start position:0%
that there are a lot of potential new
 
05:57:36.750 --> 05:57:36.760 align:start position:0%
housing developments that can be
 
05:57:38.670 --> 05:57:38.680 align:start position:0%
unlocked with this in addition to
 
05:57:40.868 --> 05:57:40.878 align:start position:0%
Commercial and that's one of the topics
 
05:57:45.350 --> 05:57:45.360 align:start position:0%
of the day um and for good reason the
 
05:57:48.150 --> 05:57:48.160 align:start position:0%
refinance question it it depends on
 
05:57:50.990 --> 05:57:51.000 align:start position:0%
which debt is being refinanced so you're
 
05:57:53.788 --> 05:57:53.798 align:start position:0%
going to have assumedly a bank loan
 
05:57:55.708 --> 05:57:55.718 align:start position:0%
conventional bank loan secured by a
 
05:57:58.548 --> 05:57:58.558 align:start position:0%
mortgage and then you have this cpce
 
05:57:58.558 --> 05:57:59.948 align:start position:0%
mortgage and then you have this cpce
loan

05:57:59.948 --> 05:57:59.958 align:start position:0%
loan
 
05:58:02.868 --> 05:58:02.878 align:start position:0%
underneath with the tax assessment
 
05:58:05.110 --> 05:58:05.120 align:start position:0%
structure if it's the bank loan that's
 
05:58:08.310 --> 05:58:08.320 align:start position:0%
being refin financed nothing changes for
 
05:58:10.788 --> 05:58:10.798 align:start position:0%
the cpce loan right it's just it keeps
 
05:58:15.390 --> 05:58:15.400 align:start position:0%
on ticking the way that it is if it's a
 
05:58:18.990 --> 05:58:19.000 align:start position:0%
new cace loan then how it works is the
 
05:58:22.230 --> 05:58:22.240 align:start position:0%
old cace loan is if it's refinanced is
 
05:58:26.270 --> 05:58:26.280 align:start position:0%
paid the recorded instrument is released
 
05:58:27.708 --> 05:58:27.718 align:start position:0%
you get a loan payoff statement just
 
05:58:29.868 --> 05:58:29.878 align:start position:0%
like you do with any other loan and then
 
05:58:34.150 --> 05:58:34.160 align:start position:0%
a new one is added and so one comes off
 
05:58:37.070 --> 05:58:37.080 align:start position:0%
one comes on it it's really not that
 
05:58:39.468 --> 05:58:39.478 align:start position:0%
different than a normal Loan in that
 
05:58:42.830 --> 05:58:42.840 align:start position:0%
regard yeah thank you yes
 
05:58:45.868 --> 05:58:45.878 align:start position:0%
sir representative partiall has a
 
05:58:49.750 --> 05:58:49.760 align:start position:0%
question thank you chair now please tell
 
05:58:53.350 --> 05:58:53.360 align:start position:0%
me if I understand this correctly um the
 
05:58:56.628 --> 05:58:56.638 align:start position:0%
uh property tax uh financing is on top
 
05:58:58.350 --> 05:58:58.360 align:start position:0%
of whatever additional property tax it
 
05:59:00.310 --> 05:59:00.320 align:start position:0%
will not affect the property tax revenue
 
05:59:03.190 --> 05:59:03.200 align:start position:0%
of any given municipality however at the
 
05:59:05.030 --> 05:59:05.040 align:start position:0%
end when the the conclusion of the
 
05:59:08.990 --> 05:59:09.000 align:start position:0%
program any improvements are
 
05:59:13.270 --> 05:59:13.280 align:start position:0%
taxable yes great question so what's one
 
05:59:16.310 --> 05:59:16.320 align:start position:0%
of the reasons that you see eventually
 
05:59:18.468 --> 05:59:18.478 align:start position:0%
usually see markets warm up to cace
 
05:59:20.070 --> 05:59:20.080 align:start position:0%
after kind of there was some trepidation
 
05:59:22.270 --> 05:59:22.280 align:start position:0%
and what the markets have determined
 
05:59:23.990 --> 05:59:24.000 align:start position:0%
over time is these improvements improve
 
05:59:26.670 --> 05:59:26.680 align:start position:0%
values right so debts are finally
 
05:59:28.590 --> 05:59:28.600 align:start position:0%
reduced but now you have a better
 
05:59:33.190 --> 05:59:33.200 align:start position:0%
property you know and if an owner um I
 
05:59:34.468 --> 05:59:34.478 align:start position:0%
mean I guess no one likes to pay more
 
05:59:36.230 --> 05:59:36.240 align:start position:0%
taxes maybe they do I don't know but you
 
05:59:37.750 --> 05:59:37.760 align:start position:0%
know if the value is up and the town
 
05:59:40.230 --> 05:59:40.240 align:start position:0%
assesses you higher as a result all
 
05:59:42.190 --> 05:59:42.200 align:start position:0%
things being equal you'll be paying more
 
05:59:46.030 --> 05:59:46.040 align:start position:0%
property taxes um that's what happens I
 
05:59:48.310 --> 05:59:48.320 align:start position:0%
guess when you improve your property uh
 
05:59:51.110 --> 05:59:51.120 align:start position:0%
so I'm told price of civilization I
 
05:59:54.990 --> 05:59:55.000 align:start position:0%
guess may ask you followup go yes uh not
 
05:59:57.310 --> 05:59:57.320 align:start position:0%
actually a followup um could I ask you
 
06:00:00.590 --> 06:00:00.600 align:start position:0%
if the name of the honorable Mana puty
 
06:00:01.948 --> 06:00:01.958 align:start position:0%
is familiar was she was she on the
 
06:00:05.708 --> 06:00:05.718 align:start position:0%
original drafting of this already in law
 
06:00:08.628 --> 06:00:08.638 align:start position:0%
she was is on the version she may have
 
06:00:10.788 --> 06:00:10.798 align:start position:0%
been on both versions that I've seen
 
06:00:12.270 --> 06:00:12.280 align:start position:0%
come through this house actually now
 
06:00:15.468 --> 06:00:15.478 align:start position:0%
that I think of it yes thank you it was
 
06:00:18.830 --> 06:00:18.840 align:start position:0%
again okay any additional
 
06:00:21.390 --> 06:00:21.400 align:start position:0%
questions all right seeing none
 
06:00:23.230 --> 06:00:23.240 align:start position:0%
fantastic job and it's great to see you
 
06:00:24.590 --> 06:00:24.600 align:start position:0%
again here in the house thank you Mr
 
06:00:27.310 --> 06:00:27.320 align:start position:0%
chairman it's a pleasure
 
06:00:31.190 --> 06:00:31.200 align:start position:0%
now I asked uh Sam Evans Brown if he
 
06:00:33.868 --> 06:00:33.878 align:start position:0%
would be willing to uh talk about this
 
06:00:36.670 --> 06:00:36.680 align:start position:0%
bill because as a former journalist
 
06:00:39.150 --> 06:00:39.160 align:start position:0%
nobody can do summaries better than than
 
06:00:42.230 --> 06:00:42.240 align:start position:0%
Sam plus he offers um
 
06:00:45.510 --> 06:00:45.520 align:start position:0%
insights penetrating insights uh unlike
 
06:00:47.350 --> 06:00:47.360 align:start position:0%
virtually anybody who comes before this
 
06:00:50.430 --> 06:00:50.440 align:start position:0%
committee too kind chairman but but if
 
06:00:53.350 --> 06:00:53.360 align:start position:0%
you feel uncomfortable at all because uh
 
06:00:56.670 --> 06:00:56.680 align:start position:0%
Mr key Williams may have key Wallace
 
06:00:58.628 --> 06:00:58.638 align:start position:0%
rather may have stolen all your
 
06:01:00.788 --> 06:01:00.798 align:start position:0%
thunder you don't have to but if you'd
 
06:01:02.990 --> 06:01:03.000 align:start position:0%
like to we'd love to hear from you I
 
06:01:04.270 --> 06:01:04.280 align:start position:0%
just I'm already sitting in the chair
 
06:01:06.628 --> 06:01:06.638 align:start position:0%
I'll be very brief um
 
06:01:08.830 --> 06:01:08.840 align:start position:0%
I I'll so Sam Evin Brown for the record
 
06:01:09.990 --> 06:01:10.000 align:start position:0%
executive director of clean energy New
 
06:01:11.948 --> 06:01:11.958 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I I'll share the same story
 
06:01:13.510 --> 06:01:13.520 align:start position:0%
that I shared in the Senate which is
 
06:01:16.110 --> 06:01:16.120 align:start position:0%
that as a journalist I remember the
 
06:01:18.430 --> 06:01:18.440 align:start position:0%
founder of my organization uh Laura
 
06:01:19.868 --> 06:01:19.878 align:start position:0%
Richardson who at that time was working
 
06:01:21.868 --> 06:01:21.878 align:start position:0%
for the Jordan Institute and who was
 
06:01:23.310 --> 06:01:23.320 align:start position:0%
intimately involved with the passage of
 
06:01:27.270 --> 06:01:27.280 align:start position:0%
the 2010 cpay statute that never took
 
06:01:30.110 --> 06:01:30.120 align:start position:0%
hold uh I remember she was making the
 
06:01:32.070 --> 06:01:32.080 align:start position:0%
rounds of communities trying to convince
 
06:01:34.150 --> 06:01:34.160 align:start position:0%
them to create cpce districts and and
 
06:01:36.230 --> 06:01:36.240 align:start position:0%
get this program off the ground and at
 
06:01:37.910 --> 06:01:37.920 align:start position:0%
that time couldn't get anyone to take
 
06:01:39.670 --> 06:01:39.680 align:start position:0%
her up on it precisely because of the
 
06:01:41.628 --> 06:01:41.638 align:start position:0%
flaws in the bill that that Mr key
 
06:01:44.510 --> 06:01:44.520 align:start position:0%
Wallace just outlined and I remember uh
 
06:01:46.830 --> 06:01:46.840 align:start position:0%
Miss Richardson sort of pleading with me
 
06:01:48.350 --> 06:01:48.360 align:start position:0%
to not do a story because she didn't
 
06:01:49.990 --> 06:01:50.000 align:start position:0%
want to Spook any of the towns that she
 
06:01:51.788 --> 06:01:51.798 align:start position:0%
was she was trying to engage with and so
 
06:01:53.708 --> 06:01:53.718 align:start position:0%
I think I actually never did the story
 
06:01:55.548 --> 06:01:55.558 align:start position:0%
at the time so uh this goes all the way
 
06:01:57.150 --> 06:01:57.160 align:start position:0%
back to my the very beginning of my
 
06:01:58.990 --> 06:01:59.000 align:start position:0%
career as a cub reporter uh as following
 
06:02:00.590 --> 06:02:00.600 align:start position:0%
this so I'm I'm very pleased that it's
 
06:02:03.708 --> 06:02:03.718 align:start position:0%
passing uh or it seems on track to pass
 
06:02:05.708 --> 06:02:05.718 align:start position:0%
with the bipartisan support that it has
 
06:02:05.718 --> 06:02:06.590 align:start position:0%
with the bipartisan support that it has
um

06:02:06.590 --> 06:02:06.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:02:09.390 --> 06:02:09.400 align:start position:0%
my my you know my we's the beef response
 
06:02:13.190 --> 06:02:13.200 align:start position:0%
to to the cpce legislation is that um
 
06:02:15.070 --> 06:02:15.080 align:start position:0%
Energy Efficiency as as I think this
 
06:02:16.868 --> 06:02:16.878 align:start position:0%
committee has heard uh somewhat ad
 
06:02:19.230 --> 06:02:19.240 align:start position:0%
nauseum suffers from a number of market
 
06:02:21.590 --> 06:02:21.600 align:start position:0%
failures um I think it it's easiest to
 
06:02:23.948 --> 06:02:23.958 align:start position:0%
identifying the residential sector where
 
06:02:26.390 --> 06:02:26.400 align:start position:0%
you have uh improvements that have high
 
06:02:29.190 --> 06:02:29.200 align:start position:0%
upfront costs and long payback periods
 
06:02:30.708 --> 06:02:30.718 align:start position:0%
and so many Energy Efficiency
 
06:02:32.628 --> 06:02:32.638 align:start position:0%
improvements do pay for themselves
 
06:02:34.590 --> 06:02:34.600 align:start position:0%
particularly you know there's there's
 
06:02:36.190 --> 06:02:36.200 align:start position:0%
many that have a 10-year pay payback
 
06:02:38.548 --> 06:02:38.558 align:start position:0%
period the average uh homeowner in the
 
06:02:39.868 --> 06:02:39.878 align:start position:0%
United States only lives in their home
 
06:02:41.948 --> 06:02:41.958 align:start position:0%
for eight years and so it's very
 
06:02:43.868 --> 06:02:43.878 align:start position:0%
difficult to get people to to in make
 
06:02:45.110 --> 06:02:45.120 align:start position:0%
that investment in their property when
 
06:02:46.548 --> 06:02:46.558 align:start position:0%
they don't they're not certain about
 
06:02:47.590 --> 06:02:47.600 align:start position:0%
their future they're not certain if
 
06:02:49.230 --> 06:02:49.240 align:start position:0%
they're going to recoup that investment
 
06:02:51.430 --> 06:02:51.440 align:start position:0%
and and so all of society suffers as a
 
06:02:54.070 --> 06:02:54.080 align:start position:0%
result with less efficient housing stock
 
06:02:57.270 --> 06:02:57.280 align:start position:0%
um there for a number of reasons uh uh
 
06:02:59.708 --> 06:02:59.718 align:start position:0%
there there it's not considered best
 
06:03:02.190 --> 06:03:02.200 align:start position:0%
practice to do SE uh Pace as a
 
06:03:03.868 --> 06:03:03.878 align:start position:0%
residential product there have been
 
06:03:05.948 --> 06:03:05.958 align:start position:0%
abuses uh with Pace loans in the
 
06:03:08.788 --> 06:03:08.798 align:start position:0%
residential sector in the past um and so
 
06:03:10.670 --> 06:03:10.680 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire gets to draft off of the
 
06:03:12.830 --> 06:03:12.840 align:start position:0%
states that have made those mistakes and
 
06:03:14.910 --> 06:03:14.920 align:start position:0%
and not uh introduce this as a as a
 
06:03:16.868 --> 06:03:16.878 align:start position:0%
residential loan product and instead
 
06:03:19.430 --> 06:03:19.440 align:start position:0%
limit it to the commercial sector where
 
06:03:21.750 --> 06:03:21.760 align:start position:0%
the builders the lenders the the the
 
06:03:23.468 --> 06:03:23.478 align:start position:0%
buyers and sellers of these properties
 
06:03:25.350 --> 06:03:25.360 align:start position:0%
are sophisticated enough to not make the
 
06:03:26.590 --> 06:03:26.600 align:start position:0%
same kind of mistakes that your average
 
06:03:29.030 --> 06:03:29.040 align:start position:0%
homeowner might make um and and I would
 
06:03:31.270 --> 06:03:31.280 align:start position:0%
say generally speaking one of the key
 
06:03:33.910 --> 06:03:33.920 align:start position:0%
challenges of of uh the clean energy
 
06:03:35.868 --> 06:03:35.878 align:start position:0%
transition that my organization is is
 
06:03:38.070 --> 06:03:38.080 align:start position:0%
fond of talking about is that many of
 
06:03:39.350 --> 06:03:39.360 align:start position:0%
the Investments that we're hoping
 
06:03:41.708 --> 06:03:41.718 align:start position:0%
Society is going to make do pay for
 
06:03:43.030 --> 06:03:43.040 align:start position:0%
themselves but it's very it's over a
 
06:03:45.270 --> 06:03:45.280 align:start position:0%
very long window uh and so you're
 
06:03:47.830 --> 06:03:47.840 align:start position:0%
swapping the cost of fuel for the cost
 
06:03:50.270 --> 06:03:50.280 align:start position:0%
of finance and figuring out ways to
 
06:03:53.468 --> 06:03:53.478 align:start position:0%
leverage low cost private Finance is an
 
06:03:56.590 --> 06:03:56.600 align:start position:0%
essential tool for how we we make uh
 
06:03:59.070 --> 06:03:59.080 align:start position:0%
more of these types of interventions um
 
06:04:02.230 --> 06:04:02.240 align:start position:0%
cost- effective and so so in this regard
 
06:04:05.310 --> 06:04:05.320 align:start position:0%
uh reducing the risk that A lender might
 
06:04:06.788 --> 06:04:06.798 align:start position:0%
not get paid back for an Energy
 
06:04:09.150 --> 06:04:09.160 align:start position:0%
Efficiency loan allows them to lower the
 
06:04:10.270 --> 06:04:10.280 align:start position:0%
interest rate that they're they're
 
06:04:12.190 --> 06:04:12.200 align:start position:0%
willing to offer the the the loan
 
06:04:14.030 --> 06:04:14.040 align:start position:0%
product for and it brings in more
 
06:04:16.430 --> 06:04:16.440 align:start position:0%
private Finance to do Energy Efficiency
 
06:04:17.910 --> 06:04:17.920 align:start position:0%
which which ultimately is what we need I
 
06:04:19.150 --> 06:04:19.160 align:start position:0%
mean there's not enough government money
 
06:04:21.230 --> 06:04:21.240 align:start position:0%
in the world to to upgrade the entire
 
06:04:22.948 --> 06:04:22.958 align:start position:0%
building stock of the United States we
 
06:04:25.468 --> 06:04:25.478 align:start position:0%
need private lenders to do this so
 
06:04:27.430 --> 06:04:27.440 align:start position:0%
really great bill um happy to take
 
06:04:29.708 --> 06:04:29.718 align:start position:0%
questions but as I said to Chairman Vose
 
06:04:31.350 --> 06:04:31.360 align:start position:0%
uh James ke wals really is the lending
 
06:04:31.360 --> 06:04:33.628 align:start position:0%
uh James ke wals really is the lending
expert

06:04:33.628 --> 06:04:33.638 align:start position:0%
expert
 
06:04:36.270 --> 06:04:36.280 align:start position:0%
here representative Wendy thas has a
 
06:04:38.990 --> 06:04:39.000 align:start position:0%
question nevertheless yes I do thank you
 
06:04:42.030 --> 06:04:42.040 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and uh thank you for being here
 
06:04:44.030 --> 06:04:44.040 align:start position:0%
um you're you're probably not going to
 
06:04:45.948 --> 06:04:45.958 align:start position:0%
like this question but you know there
 
06:04:48.190 --> 06:04:48.200 align:start position:0%
you go as someone who lives and breeds
 
06:04:50.230 --> 06:04:50.240 align:start position:0%
energy um I'm going to put you on the
 
06:04:51.990 --> 06:04:52.000 align:start position:0%
spot because you're very familiar with
 
06:04:53.910 --> 06:04:53.920 align:start position:0%
this bill this is the third time we've
 
06:04:57.708 --> 06:04:57.718 align:start position:0%
worked on it um when we replace things
 
06:04:59.390 --> 06:04:59.400 align:start position:0%
um and there's a lot of replacing in
 
06:05:01.270 --> 06:05:01.280 align:start position:0%
this bill there's a lot of strikeouts
 
06:05:04.030 --> 06:05:04.040 align:start position:0%
often there are unintended consequences
 
06:05:06.990 --> 06:05:07.000 align:start position:0%
do you see any potential poal unintended
 
06:05:09.030 --> 06:05:09.040 align:start position:0%
consequences of this bill or any red
 
06:05:12.390 --> 06:05:12.400 align:start position:0%
flags at all I I don't um it it actually
 
06:05:13.350 --> 06:05:13.360 align:start position:0%
would have been great to have the
 
06:05:15.750 --> 06:05:15.760 align:start position:0%
bankers Association here to to take that
 
06:05:17.190 --> 06:05:17.200 align:start position:0%
specific question I know that they've
 
06:05:19.990 --> 06:05:20.000 align:start position:0%
had input on this bill I mean the the
 
06:05:22.030 --> 06:05:22.040 align:start position:0%
language that's being struck is language
 
06:05:24.030 --> 06:05:24.040 align:start position:0%
that has not resulted in a single loan
 
06:05:27.468 --> 06:05:27.478 align:start position:0%
being originated so it it I I struggle
 
06:05:30.110 --> 06:05:30.120 align:start position:0%
to see what we'd be what what
 
06:05:31.628 --> 06:05:31.638 align:start position:0%
consequence we might have on a program
 
06:05:34.310 --> 06:05:34.320 align:start position:0%
that has never been never been
 
06:05:38.110 --> 06:05:38.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:40.150 --> 06:05:40.160 align:start position:0%
any additional
 
06:05:42.230 --> 06:05:42.240 align:start position:0%
questions since I introduced the bill
 
06:05:44.468 --> 06:05:44.478 align:start position:0%
I'm not allowed to ask a question but
 
06:05:45.670 --> 06:05:45.680 align:start position:0%
I'm going to make a statement and you
 
06:05:48.190 --> 06:05:48.200 align:start position:0%
can disagree with it if you
 
06:05:51.430 --> 06:05:51.440 align:start position:0%
want the chair you can do that this bill
 
06:05:54.868 --> 06:05:54.878 align:start position:0%
I think the intention of this bill is
 
06:05:59.590 --> 06:05:59.600 align:start position:0%
to improve the affordable housing
 
06:06:01.868 --> 06:06:01.878 align:start position:0%
situation uh so so representative
 
06:06:03.830 --> 06:06:03.840 align:start position:0%
schneller asked a question of Mr James
 
06:06:07.110 --> 06:06:07.120 align:start position:0%
key Wallace before which which my which
 
06:06:08.270 --> 06:06:08.280 align:start position:0%
is why is there so much political
 
06:06:10.350 --> 06:06:10.360 align:start position:0%
Firepower behind this bill my
 
06:06:11.350 --> 06:06:11.360 align:start position:0%
understanding is that there are a number
 
06:06:13.628 --> 06:06:13.638 align:start position:0%
of housing developers that are looking
 
06:06:16.548 --> 06:06:16.558 align:start position:0%
at how can they get additional Capital
 
06:06:17.990 --> 06:06:18.000 align:start position:0%
into their project how can they bring a
 
06:06:20.190 --> 06:06:20.200 align:start position:0%
new types of lending into their Capital
 
06:06:21.590 --> 06:06:21.600 align:start position:0%
stack that will help them get their
 
06:06:24.910 --> 06:06:24.920 align:start position:0%
project done uh and and without cpce
 
06:06:26.628 --> 06:06:26.638 align:start position:0%
lending they don't think that they will
 
06:06:29.548 --> 06:06:29.558 align:start position:0%
have the capital to to do their
 
06:06:31.990 --> 06:06:32.000 align:start position:0%
projects representative Matson has a
 
06:06:33.750 --> 06:06:33.760 align:start position:0%
question so if it starts out with
 
06:06:35.788 --> 06:06:35.798 align:start position:0%
Builder Association or whatever do doing
 
06:06:39.350 --> 06:06:39.360 align:start position:0%
a group it's commercial but if they sell
 
06:06:41.830 --> 06:06:41.840 align:start position:0%
a home to a person it becomes
 
06:06:44.670 --> 06:06:44.680 align:start position:0%
residential does does it still follow
 
06:06:46.868 --> 06:06:46.878 align:start position:0%
well so so the the this program is
 
06:06:48.910 --> 06:06:48.920 align:start position:0%
limited at at five properties that are
 
06:06:52.030 --> 06:06:52.040 align:start position:0%
five units or more so um so if if it
 
06:06:54.430 --> 06:06:54.440 align:start position:0%
were to be sold to a person it would be
 
06:06:56.910 --> 06:06:56.920 align:start position:0%
a landlord who's who's U making an
 
06:06:59.070 --> 06:06:59.080 align:start position:0%
investment into a five unit or more
 
06:07:01.270 --> 06:07:01.280 align:start position:0%
property um certainly it's the case that
 
06:07:02.628 --> 06:07:02.638 align:start position:0%
there are some landlords you know
 
06:07:03.868 --> 06:07:03.878 align:start position:0%
speaking of someone who's a landlord
 
06:07:05.150 --> 06:07:05.160 align:start position:0%
myself there are some landlords who are
 
06:07:07.670 --> 06:07:07.680 align:start position:0%
just regular folks and and are maybe not
 
06:07:09.670 --> 06:07:09.680 align:start position:0%
that sophisticated and might might uh
 
06:07:11.030 --> 06:07:11.040 align:start position:0%
might have trouble understanding the
 
06:07:13.948 --> 06:07:13.958 align:start position:0%
cpce program but um but I will say you
 
06:07:16.628 --> 06:07:16.638 align:start position:0%
know to I I did a bit of a deep dive
 
06:07:20.390 --> 06:07:20.400 align:start position:0%
into how the original cpce uh excuse me
 
06:07:22.230 --> 06:07:22.240 align:start position:0%
the original Pace residential Pace
 
06:07:24.948 --> 06:07:24.958 align:start position:0%
programs the abuses that happened there
 
06:07:27.590 --> 06:07:27.600 align:start position:0%
what the the key problem was that there
 
06:07:30.350 --> 06:07:30.360 align:start position:0%
were contractors that were selling
 
06:07:32.548 --> 06:07:32.558 align:start position:0%
improvements to homeowners and the
 
06:07:34.310 --> 06:07:34.320 align:start position:0%
Energy savings of those improvements
 
06:07:36.270 --> 06:07:36.280 align:start position:0%
were not being verified by anybody and
 
06:07:38.430 --> 06:07:38.440 align:start position:0%
so the homeowners never saw savings
 
06:07:40.390 --> 06:07:40.400 align:start position:0%
associated with those improvements uh
 
06:07:43.270 --> 06:07:43.280 align:start position:0%
and then had a an additional costly lean
 
06:07:45.110 --> 06:07:45.120 align:start position:0%
put on their property which then made it
 
06:07:46.590 --> 06:07:46.600 align:start position:0%
more difficult for them to sell their
 
06:07:50.110 --> 06:07:50.120 align:start position:0%
home uh and and I think that that uh
 
06:07:51.868 --> 06:07:51.878 align:start position:0%
safeguards are in place with this
 
06:07:54.110 --> 06:07:54.120 align:start position:0%
program where there's there verification
 
06:07:57.468 --> 06:07:57.478 align:start position:0%
and measurement uh is is in is required
 
06:07:59.868 --> 06:07:59.878 align:start position:0%
as part of the issuance of a CPAs loan
 
06:08:01.590 --> 06:08:01.600 align:start position:0%
um so again we're sort of drafting on
 
06:08:02.990 --> 06:08:03.000 align:start position:0%
the best practices of other communities
 
06:08:03.750 --> 06:08:03.760 align:start position:0%
so I don't know if that was your
 
06:08:06.548 --> 06:08:06.558 align:start position:0%
question but yeah okay
 
06:08:10.350 --> 06:08:10.360 align:start position:0%
yes follow up so if a developer builds
 
06:08:12.788 --> 06:08:12.798 align:start position:0%
20 homes he doesn't want to keep the 20
 
06:08:15.230 --> 06:08:15.240 align:start position:0%
homes he wants everybody to buy one so
 
06:08:18.788 --> 06:08:18.798 align:start position:0%
when the person buys a home from the
 
06:08:21.670 --> 06:08:21.680 align:start position:0%
developer right doesn't that follow with
 
06:08:23.628 --> 06:08:23.638 align:start position:0%
it so so my understanding is that those
 
06:08:26.030 --> 06:08:26.040 align:start position:0%
20 homes if you're doing a standard 20
 
06:08:28.390 --> 06:08:28.400 align:start position:0%
single single homes they wouldn't be
 
06:08:29.670 --> 06:08:29.680 align:start position:0%
eligible under this program it would
 
06:08:32.070 --> 06:08:32.080 align:start position:0%
have to be a multifam unit with five
 
06:08:35.670 --> 06:08:35.680 align:start position:0%
units in one building
 
06:08:42.030 --> 06:08:42.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:08:44.150 --> 06:08:44.160 align:start position:0%
correct okay seeing no additional
 
06:08:46.110 --> 06:08:46.120 align:start position:0%
questions I want to thank you Sam Evans
 
06:08:49.590 --> 06:08:49.600 align:start position:0%
Brown for sharing your expertise with us
 
06:08:52.468 --> 06:08:52.478 align:start position:0%
and your insights and with that since I
 
06:08:54.190 --> 06:08:54.200 align:start position:0%
have no more pink cards I'm going to
 
06:08:58.670 --> 06:08:58.680 align:start position:0%
close the public hearing on House Bill
 
06:08:58.680 --> 06:09:01.548 align:start position:0%
close the public hearing on House Bill
45

06:09:01.548 --> 06:09:01.558 align:start position:0%
45
 
06:09:04.948 --> 06:09:04.958 align:start position:0%
Z and that for the most part concludes
 
06:09:07.030 --> 06:09:07.040 align:start position:0%
our business for the day there is one
 
06:09:10.230 --> 06:09:10.240 align:start position:0%
other matter however that I want to uh
 
06:09:12.910 --> 06:09:12.920 align:start position:0%
share with all of you and that is that I
 
06:09:18.430 --> 06:09:18.440 align:start position:0%
have received fiscal notes for six
 
06:09:22.548 --> 06:09:22.558 align:start position:0%
bills say nothing they for all practical
 
06:09:26.430 --> 06:09:26.440 align:start position:0%
purposes say nothing um for example on
 
06:09:30.310 --> 06:09:30.320 align:start position:0%
654 FN the fiscal note says the office
 
06:09:32.628 --> 06:09:32.638 align:start position:0%
of legislative budget assistance States
 
06:09:35.030 --> 06:09:35.040 align:start position:0%
this bill has no fiscal impact on state
 
06:09:38.948 --> 06:09:38.958 align:start position:0%
county or local expenditures or
 
06:09:41.750 --> 06:09:41.760 align:start position:0%
revenue and most of of the rest of these
 
06:09:44.310 --> 06:09:44.320 align:start position:0%
fiscal notes basically say the same
 
06:09:47.110 --> 06:09:47.120 align:start position:0%
thing however you may since we haven't
 
06:09:48.868 --> 06:09:48.878 align:start position:0%
heard some of these bills you may want
 
06:09:53.390 --> 06:09:53.400 align:start position:0%
to attach that fiscal note to the bill
 
06:09:55.468 --> 06:09:55.478 align:start position:0%
so that when it does come us come before
 
06:09:57.750 --> 06:09:57.760 align:start position:0%
us you'll have that
 
06:10:01.230 --> 06:10:01.240 align:start position:0%
information there is a fiscal note on
 
06:10:01.240 --> 06:10:03.110 align:start position:0%
information there is a fiscal note on
one

06:10:03.110 --> 06:10:03.120 align:start position:0%
one
 
06:10:07.468 --> 06:10:07.478 align:start position:0%
bill that uh we have already heard I
 
06:10:12.030 --> 06:10:12.040 align:start position:0%
believe yes so on House Bill
 
06:10:15.990 --> 06:10:16.000 align:start position:0%
526 we already heard that bill and
 
06:10:19.070 --> 06:10:19.080 align:start position:0%
actually um had an exec session on it
 
06:10:20.990 --> 06:10:21.000 align:start position:0%
but there is a fiscal note here finally
 
06:10:23.390 --> 06:10:23.400 align:start position:0%
for it so you're you're welcome to it
 
06:10:25.830 --> 06:10:25.840 align:start position:0%
what I'm going to do is I'm going to put
 
06:10:28.868 --> 06:10:28.878 align:start position:0%
these this stack of fiscal notes over
 
06:10:31.310 --> 06:10:31.320 align:start position:0%
there on the desk and if you want to
 
06:10:35.430 --> 06:10:35.440 align:start position:0%
grab one on your way out feel free to
 
06:10:38.390 --> 06:10:38.400 align:start position:0%
take a copy of each one or a copy of the
 
06:10:41.468 --> 06:10:41.478 align:start position:0%
ones you care about or none I I'll leave
 
06:10:44.910 --> 06:10:44.920 align:start position:0%
that up to you representative partial
 
06:10:47.670 --> 06:10:47.680 align:start position:0%
thank you can you tell me if uh if the
 
06:10:50.070 --> 06:10:50.080 align:start position:0%
um PDFs online have been updated for the
 
06:10:52.670 --> 06:10:52.680 align:start position:0%
fiscal notes are you aware I am not
 
06:10:54.990 --> 06:10:55.000 align:start position:0%
aware thank you probably but I'm not
 
06:10:58.468 --> 06:10:58.478 align:start position:0%
aware okay thanks representative Corman
 
06:11:00.468 --> 06:11:00.478 align:start position:0%
thank you uh for the bills where the
 
06:11:02.590 --> 06:11:02.600 align:start position:0%
fiscal note says that there's no fiscal
 
06:11:04.430 --> 06:11:04.440 align:start position:0%
impact does that mean that if these
 
06:11:07.190 --> 06:11:07.200 align:start position:0%
bills actually do pass the house they
 
06:11:09.390 --> 06:11:09.400 align:start position:0%
don't have to go to a second committee
 
06:11:11.708 --> 06:11:11.718 align:start position:0%
that is correct thank
 
06:11:14.708 --> 06:11:14.718 align:start position:0%
you any other
 
06:11:17.310 --> 06:11:17.320 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none we've done a lot
 
06:11:18.948 --> 06:11:18.958 align:start position:0%
of hard work this week I want to thank
 
06:11:23.548 --> 06:11:23.558 align:start position:0%
you all for two days of your attention
 
06:11:28.548 --> 06:11:28.558 align:start position:0%
and your uh diligence and your
 
06:11:30.310 --> 06:11:30.320 align:start position:0%
thoughtfulness uh I think we
 
06:11:33.230 --> 06:11:33.240 align:start position:0%
accomplished a lot this week and we'll
 
06:11:35.070 --> 06:11:35.080 align:start position:0%
do it all over again next week we'll be
 
06:11:38.628 --> 06:11:38.638 align:start position:0%
here hearing 10 bills next week we'll be
 
06:11:42.230 --> 06:11:42.240 align:start position:0%
hearing five bills the week after that I
 
06:11:44.670 --> 06:11:44.680 align:start position:0%
believe no actually we'll be hearing 10
 
06:11:46.750 --> 06:11:46.760 align:start position:0%
bills next week 10 bills the following
 
06:11:50.830 --> 06:11:50.840 align:start position:0%
week and then five bills the third week
 
06:11:53.468 --> 06:11:53.478 align:start position:0%
because and we'll only be uh here one
 
06:11:56.190 --> 06:11:56.200 align:start position:0%
day that week because the Monday of that
 
06:11:59.310 --> 06:11:59.320 align:start position:0%
week is President's Day then we'll take
 
06:12:01.270 --> 06:12:01.280 align:start position:0%
the following week off which is the the
 
06:12:03.430 --> 06:12:03.440 align:start position:0%
last week of February that's school
 
06:12:06.628 --> 06:12:06.638 align:start position:0%
vacation week and the house tries to
 
06:12:09.708 --> 06:12:09.718 align:start position:0%
discourage activity during that week and
 
06:12:11.628 --> 06:12:11.638 align:start position:0%
then we'll be back the first week of
 
06:12:15.430 --> 06:12:15.440 align:start position:0%
March to finish our public
 
06:12:18.070 --> 06:12:18.080 align:start position:0%
hearings and then we will use the second
 
06:12:20.830 --> 06:12:20.840 align:start position:0%
and third weeks of March to have
 
06:12:22.910 --> 06:12:22.920 align:start position:0%
executive sessions on any bills that we
 
06:12:26.070 --> 06:12:26.080 align:start position:0%
don't hear between now and then so
 
06:12:27.990 --> 06:12:28.000 align:start position:0%
that's the schedule going forward
 
06:12:30.590 --> 06:12:30.600 align:start position:0%
representative McGee thank you um I was
 
06:12:32.990 --> 06:12:33.000 align:start position:0%
just wondering about the sixth and
 
06:12:35.390 --> 06:12:35.400 align:start position:0%
whether the six bills that we've already
 
06:12:38.868 --> 06:12:38.878 align:start position:0%
exact are going to be heard should we be
 
06:12:41.310 --> 06:12:41.320 align:start position:0%
preparing over the weekend or testimony
 
06:12:44.750 --> 06:12:44.760 align:start position:0%
on any of these excellent question yes
 
06:12:46.590 --> 06:12:46.600 align:start position:0%
all of the bills that we've heard that
 
06:12:49.350 --> 06:12:49.360 align:start position:0%
we've exact so far will be in the
 
06:12:53.750 --> 06:12:53.760 align:start position:0%
calendar this week for next Thursday's

house session so if there are any floor

begin to prepare for those floor
 
06:13:06.750 --> 06:13:06.760 align:start position:0%
debates representative Wendy Thomas um
