32 bills that we have currently in front
 
00:07:22.070 --> 00:07:22.080 align:start position:0%
of the um the that'll be in front of the
 
00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:24.560 align:start position:0%
state legislature and i'm sure that's
 
00:07:26.230 --> 00:07:26.240 align:start position:0%
not an exhaustive list at the time i ran
 
00:07:28.070 --> 00:07:28.080 align:start position:0%
this the senate still had some openings
 
00:07:29.270 --> 00:07:29.280 align:start position:0%
for time
 
00:07:30.390 --> 00:07:30.400 align:start position:0%
and i know that there was some
 
00:07:32.390 --> 00:07:32.400 align:start position:0%
negotiations on rewriting some bills to
 
00:07:33.990 --> 00:07:34.000 align:start position:0%
consolidate them so there might not be
 
00:07:35.189 --> 00:07:35.199 align:start position:0%
quite as many
 
00:07:35.199 --> 00:07:36.070 align:start position:0%
quite as many
um

00:07:36.070 --> 00:07:36.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:07:38.309 --> 00:07:38.319 align:start position:0%

topic you may just want to know that
 
00:07:41.350 --> 00:07:41.360 align:start position:0%
those are there
 
00:07:42.950 --> 00:07:42.960 align:start position:0%

00:08:52.949 --> 00:08:52.959 align:start position:0%
workplace and their
 
00:08:55.829 --> 00:08:55.839 align:start position:0%
ability to
 
00:08:55.839 --> 00:08:56.710 align:start position:0%
ability to
have

00:08:56.710 --> 00:08:56.720 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:08:59.269 --> 00:08:59.279 align:start position:0%
a vaccine mandate as a condition of
 
00:09:01.590 --> 00:09:01.600 align:start position:0%
employment either because they think
 
00:09:03.670 --> 00:09:03.680 align:start position:0%
it's the right thing to do in terms of
 
00:09:05.910 --> 00:09:05.920 align:start position:0%
the health and safety of their employees
 
00:09:08.630 --> 00:09:08.640 align:start position:0%
or if they're complying with federal
 
00:09:11.110 --> 00:09:11.120 align:start position:0%
vaccine mandates which
 
00:09:13.829 --> 00:09:13.839 align:start position:0%
many employers in the state uh are
 
00:09:16.150 --> 00:09:16.160 align:start position:0%
either already having to comply with if
 
00:09:19.030 --> 00:09:19.040 align:start position:0%
they have federal contracts or will soon
 
00:09:22.150 --> 00:09:22.160 align:start position:0%
likely be having to comply with once
 
00:09:24.310 --> 00:09:24.320 align:start position:0%
osha has released their draft rules
 
00:09:27.269 --> 00:09:27.279 align:start position:0%
relating to the executive order
 
00:09:30.310 --> 00:09:30.320 align:start position:0%
our position is that
 
00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:31.590 align:start position:0%
our position is that
employers

00:09:31.590 --> 00:09:31.600 align:start position:0%
employers
 
00:09:33.750 --> 00:09:33.760 align:start position:0%
really need to have the flexibility and
 
00:09:36.310 --> 00:09:36.320 align:start position:0%
ability to implement health and safety
 
00:09:38.470 --> 00:09:38.480 align:start position:0%
policies within the workplace that they
 
00:09:40.550 --> 00:09:40.560 align:start position:0%
deem appropriate
 
00:09:44.150 --> 00:09:44.160 align:start position:0%
and for some employers that
 
00:09:46.550 --> 00:09:46.560 align:start position:0%
could be a vaccine mandate although i
 
00:09:49.030 --> 00:09:49.040 align:start position:0%
will say right now
 
00:09:51.030 --> 00:09:51.040 align:start position:0%
among our membership
 
00:09:52.710 --> 00:09:52.720 align:start position:0%
those employers who've implemented a
 
00:09:55.829 --> 00:09:55.839 align:start position:0%
vaccine mandate is
 
00:09:58.550 --> 00:09:58.560 align:start position:0%
not common it tends to be
 
00:10:01.030 --> 00:10:01.040 align:start position:0%
among our hospital members and we also
 
00:10:03.509 --> 00:10:03.519 align:start position:0%
have several manufacturing members
 
00:10:05.509 --> 00:10:05.519 align:start position:0%
who contract with the federal government
 
00:10:07.910 --> 00:10:07.920 align:start position:0%
who have very recently implemented
 
00:10:10.949 --> 00:10:10.959 align:start position:0%
vaccine mandates among their employees
 
00:10:13.829 --> 00:10:13.839 align:start position:0%
the response from employees in those
 
00:10:13.839 --> 00:10:15.430 align:start position:0%
the response from employees in those
companies

00:10:15.430 --> 00:10:15.440 align:start position:0%
companies
 
00:10:19.269 --> 00:10:19.279 align:start position:0%
has not been overwhelmingly negative
 
00:10:21.910 --> 00:10:21.920 align:start position:0%
there have been
 
00:10:24.310 --> 00:10:24.320 align:start position:0%
instances that i'm aware of what of a
 
00:10:26.550 --> 00:10:26.560 align:start position:0%
one-day employee walk out from those
 
00:10:30.790 --> 00:10:30.800 align:start position:0%
employees who were not happy with the
 
00:10:32.949 --> 00:10:32.959 align:start position:0%
new vaccine mandate
 
00:10:34.870 --> 00:10:34.880 align:start position:0%
but they returned to work the following
 
00:10:37.430 --> 00:10:37.440 align:start position:0%
day and there have been
 
00:10:40.710 --> 00:10:40.720 align:start position:0%
little if any
 
00:10:42.790 --> 00:10:42.800 align:start position:0%
instances of employees
 
00:10:45.110 --> 00:10:45.120 align:start position:0%
choosing to leave employment because of
 
00:10:47.430 --> 00:10:47.440 align:start position:0%
the vaccine mandate
 
00:10:49.990 --> 00:10:50.000 align:start position:0%
we view this as being very similar to
 
00:10:53.110 --> 00:10:53.120 align:start position:0%
other health and safety mandates that
 
00:10:55.269 --> 00:10:55.279 align:start position:0%
are already in place either through
 
00:10:57.269 --> 00:10:57.279 align:start position:0%
federal or state regulation or because
 
00:11:00.069 --> 00:11:00.079 align:start position:0%
the employee deems its the employee the
 
00:11:03.750 --> 00:11:03.760 align:start position:0%
employer deems it the appropriate
 
00:11:05.750 --> 00:11:05.760 align:start position:0%
thing to do for example
 
00:11:08.150 --> 00:11:08.160 align:start position:0%
most if not all employers require seat
 
00:11:10.630 --> 00:11:10.640 align:start position:0%
belt use if you're driving a company
 
00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:12.310 align:start position:0%
belt use if you're driving a company
vehicle

00:11:12.310 --> 00:11:12.320 align:start position:0%
vehicle
 
00:11:15.190 --> 00:11:15.200 align:start position:0%
most employers food services employers
 
00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:16.470 align:start position:0%
most employers food services employers
require

00:11:16.470 --> 00:11:16.480 align:start position:0%
require
 
00:11:18.150 --> 00:11:18.160 align:start position:0%
some type of hair net if you're in the
 
00:11:21.990 --> 00:11:22.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:24.470 --> 00:11:24.480 align:start position:0%
all employers in
 
00:11:26.949 --> 00:11:26.959 align:start position:0%
construction areas require hard hats to
 
00:11:28.790 --> 00:11:28.800 align:start position:0%
be worn
 
00:11:31.030 --> 00:11:31.040 align:start position:0%
depending on your job you may be
 
00:11:33.430 --> 00:11:33.440 align:start position:0%
required to wear an orange safety vest i
 
00:11:37.030 --> 00:11:37.040 align:start position:0%
could go on and on but the point is
 
00:11:38.949 --> 00:11:38.959 align:start position:0%
with none of those
 
00:11:41.509 --> 00:11:41.519 align:start position:0%
requirements does an employee have the
 
00:11:44.389 --> 00:11:44.399 align:start position:0%
choice to say i'm opting out
 
00:11:47.030 --> 00:11:47.040 align:start position:0%
i'm a conscientious objector to that and
 
00:11:49.190 --> 00:11:49.200 align:start position:0%
therefore don't have to do it the
 
00:11:51.829 --> 00:11:51.839 align:start position:0%
employee is required to follow those
 
00:11:53.350 --> 00:11:53.360 align:start position:0%
health and safety
 
00:11:55.910 --> 00:11:55.920 align:start position:0%
requirements set up by the employer and
 
00:11:57.750 --> 00:11:57.760 align:start position:0%
we think the same thing should be true
 
00:11:59.990 --> 00:12:00.000 align:start position:0%
with with vaccine mandates
 
00:12:01.829 --> 00:12:01.839 align:start position:0%
that's all i have mr chair i'd be happy
 
00:12:03.670 --> 00:12:03.680 align:start position:0%
to address any questions
 
00:12:05.509 --> 00:12:05.519 align:start position:0%
thank you david uh any questions for
 
00:12:05.519 --> 00:12:07.030 align:start position:0%
thank you david uh any questions for
david

00:12:07.030 --> 00:12:07.040 align:start position:0%
david
 
00:12:09.110 --> 00:12:09.120 align:start position:0%
representative goalie
 
00:12:11.190 --> 00:12:11.200 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you good to see
 
00:12:12.310 --> 00:12:12.320 align:start position:0%
you there
 
00:12:12.320 --> 00:12:13.670 align:start position:0%
you there
um

00:12:13.670 --> 00:12:13.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:12:15.590 --> 00:12:15.600 align:start position:0%
and is it also
 
00:12:17.670 --> 00:12:17.680 align:start position:0%
appropriate that if a business so
 
00:12:19.030 --> 00:12:19.040 align:start position:0%
chooses to do a
 
00:12:21.750 --> 00:12:21.760 align:start position:0%
vaccine mandate for their company um it
 
00:12:23.030 --> 00:12:23.040 align:start position:0%
may be in the best interest of the
 
00:12:24.949 --> 00:12:24.959 align:start position:0%
company for to keep
 
00:12:28.230 --> 00:12:28.240 align:start position:0%
their employees from getting
 
00:12:30.150 --> 00:12:30.160 align:start position:0%
ill or sick and
 
00:12:31.910 --> 00:12:31.920 align:start position:0%
having to close down their business it's
 
00:12:33.350 --> 00:12:33.360 align:start position:0%
a business
 
00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:35.750 align:start position:0%
a business
um

00:12:35.750 --> 00:12:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:37.509 --> 00:12:37.519 align:start position:0%
explore the business
 
00:12:39.509 --> 00:12:39.519 align:start position:0%
yeah that's a very real concern and
 
00:12:42.150 --> 00:12:42.160 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of recent examples uh
 
00:12:44.550 --> 00:12:44.560 align:start position:0%
with the advent of the pandemic
 
00:12:44.560 --> 00:12:45.670 align:start position:0%
with the advent of the pandemic
um

00:12:45.670 --> 00:12:45.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:12:47.190 --> 00:12:47.200 align:start position:0%
i guess part of my response to your
 
00:12:49.829 --> 00:12:49.839 align:start position:0%
question repsham goalie is a lot of the
 
00:12:52.470 --> 00:12:52.480 align:start position:0%
discussion relating to this issue is
 
00:12:55.030 --> 00:12:55.040 align:start position:0%
focused on the individual rights of an
 
00:12:56.629 --> 00:12:56.639 align:start position:0%
individual to choose whether they want
 
00:12:58.710 --> 00:12:58.720 align:start position:0%
to be vaccinated or not and i understand
 
00:13:00.550 --> 00:13:00.560 align:start position:0%
that point of view
 
00:13:03.350 --> 00:13:03.360 align:start position:0%
but it tends to ignore
 
00:13:05.509 --> 00:13:05.519 align:start position:0%
the rights of other individuals other
 
00:13:08.949 --> 00:13:08.959 align:start position:0%
employees to want to work in a
 
00:13:11.590 --> 00:13:11.600 align:start position:0%
workplace that is as safe and and
 
00:13:13.590 --> 00:13:13.600 align:start position:0%
healthy as possible
 
00:13:16.949 --> 00:13:16.959 align:start position:0%
and if uh the employer deems that having
 
00:13:19.110 --> 00:13:19.120 align:start position:0%
a fully vaccinated workforce is is how
 
00:13:20.470 --> 00:13:20.480 align:start position:0%
to achieve that
 
00:13:22.550 --> 00:13:22.560 align:start position:0%
then we should recognize that that there
 
00:13:24.550 --> 00:13:24.560 align:start position:0%
are employees out there and i suspect
 
00:13:26.310 --> 00:13:26.320 align:start position:0%
it's the majority of employees at this
 
00:13:28.550 --> 00:13:28.560 align:start position:0%
point that would support that type of
 
00:13:30.230 --> 00:13:30.240 align:start position:0%
mandate because they have their own
 
00:13:31.590 --> 00:13:31.600 align:start position:0%
health and safety and the health and
 
00:13:33.110 --> 00:13:33.120 align:start position:0%
safety of their family members and
 
00:13:40.710 --> 00:13:40.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:42.790 --> 00:13:42.800 align:start position:0%
and wouldn't it also be a
 
00:13:44.230 --> 00:13:44.240 align:start position:0%
benefit to
 
00:13:45.990 --> 00:13:46.000 align:start position:0%
not losing any income for a business or
 
00:13:47.829 --> 00:13:47.839 align:start position:0%
having to shut down due to having an
 
00:13:50.790 --> 00:13:50.800 align:start position:0%
exposure in the place of employment or
 
00:13:52.870 --> 00:13:52.880 align:start position:0%
for the cost of employees being out of
 
00:13:55.509 --> 00:13:55.519 align:start position:0%
the workplace ill yeah i can um actually
 
00:13:57.670 --> 00:13:57.680 align:start position:0%
speak from personal experience some of
 
00:13:59.430 --> 00:13:59.440 align:start position:0%
you know my wife works for a dentist
 
00:14:01.750 --> 00:14:01.760 align:start position:0%
office here in town
 
00:14:04.790 --> 00:14:04.800 align:start position:0%
most of the office is vaccinated several
 
00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:06.150 align:start position:0%
most of the office is vaccinated several
employees

00:14:06.150 --> 00:14:06.160 align:start position:0%
employees
 
00:14:08.949 --> 00:14:08.959 align:start position:0%
have chosen not to be vaccinated
 
00:14:08.959 --> 00:14:10.069 align:start position:0%
have chosen not to be vaccinated
and

00:14:10.069 --> 00:14:10.079 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:14:11.110 --> 00:14:11.120 align:start position:0%
one of
 
00:14:14.829 --> 00:14:14.839 align:start position:0%
those employees recently was exposed to
 
00:14:19.269 --> 00:14:19.279 align:start position:0%
covid and as it turned out she
 
00:14:21.030 --> 00:14:21.040 align:start position:0%
well she was exposed twice the first
 
00:14:21.040 --> 00:14:21.990 align:start position:0%
well she was exposed twice the first
time

00:14:21.990 --> 00:14:22.000 align:start position:0%
time
 
00:14:23.990 --> 00:14:24.000 align:start position:0%
it turned out she didn't have it she was
 
00:14:25.430 --> 00:14:25.440 align:start position:0%
tested and didn't have it the second
 
00:14:27.590 --> 00:14:27.600 align:start position:0%
time she was tested and she did have it
 
00:14:30.150 --> 00:14:30.160 align:start position:0%
and it required her to quarantine for i
 
00:14:32.790 --> 00:14:32.800 align:start position:0%
think 14 days now she was one of two
 
00:14:35.030 --> 00:14:35.040 align:start position:0%
hygienists in the office
 
00:14:37.509 --> 00:14:37.519 align:start position:0%
so a hundred percent of the workload
 
00:14:41.030 --> 00:14:41.040 align:start position:0%
went on to the other hygienist uh in the
 
00:14:43.350 --> 00:14:43.360 align:start position:0%
real world result was they had to cancel
 
00:14:44.949 --> 00:14:44.959 align:start position:0%
appointments with patients because they
 
00:14:46.710 --> 00:14:46.720 align:start position:0%
didn't have the ability
 
00:14:49.189 --> 00:14:49.199 align:start position:0%
uh because of uh
 
00:14:51.430 --> 00:14:51.440 align:start position:0%
lack of that employee being there to to
 
00:14:53.990 --> 00:14:54.000 align:start position:0%
be able to work on the patient so
 
00:14:55.910 --> 00:14:55.920 align:start position:0%
that's just one example from my own
 
00:14:57.509 --> 00:14:57.519 align:start position:0%
personal life and i'm sure there are
 
00:15:03.269 --> 00:15:03.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:05.829 --> 00:15:05.839 align:start position:0%
anybody anybody else
 
00:15:07.750 --> 00:15:07.760 align:start position:0%
representative leon thank you very much
 
00:15:10.389 --> 00:15:10.399 align:start position:0%
mr chair and thank you mr juve
 
00:15:12.550 --> 00:15:12.560 align:start position:0%
i i understand the disruption to the
 
00:15:14.710 --> 00:15:14.720 align:start position:0%
workforce um i'm wondering if there's
 
00:15:16.150 --> 00:15:16.160 align:start position:0%
other things that the employers can
 
00:15:18.790 --> 00:15:18.800 align:start position:0%
mandate in order to prevent
 
00:15:20.550 --> 00:15:20.560 align:start position:0%
employees for being out for extended
 
00:15:23.269 --> 00:15:23.279 align:start position:0%
periods like two weeks or longer
 
00:15:26.790 --> 00:15:26.800 align:start position:0%
there there are um other things that are
 
00:15:28.389 --> 00:15:28.399 align:start position:0%
already being implemented and really
 
00:15:30.069 --> 00:15:30.079 align:start position:0%
have been implemented since the start of
 
00:15:32.710 --> 00:15:32.720 align:start position:0%
the pandemic early last year things like
 
00:15:38.150 --> 00:15:38.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:40.550 --> 00:15:40.560 align:start position:0%
one significant change which i think is
 
00:15:42.550 --> 00:15:42.560 align:start position:0%
going to change how businesses run is is
 
00:15:44.629 --> 00:15:44.639 align:start position:0%
the ability for for some employees to
 
00:15:45.749 --> 00:15:45.759 align:start position:0%
work from
 
00:15:48.230 --> 00:15:48.240 align:start position:0%
remote locations or working from home
 
00:15:51.030 --> 00:15:51.040 align:start position:0%
and i think that's going to change the
 
00:15:54.069 --> 00:15:54.079 align:start position:0%
way business operates not all jobs are
 
00:15:56.310 --> 00:15:56.320 align:start position:0%
you're not able to do that with all jobs
 
00:15:57.590 --> 00:15:57.600 align:start position:0%
uh other things that have been
 
00:15:59.030 --> 00:15:59.040 align:start position:0%
implemented in the workplace or
 
00:15:59.040 --> 00:16:00.230 align:start position:0%
implemented in the workplace or
expanding

00:16:00.230 --> 00:16:00.240 align:start position:0%
expanding
 
00:16:03.269 --> 00:16:03.279 align:start position:0%
um work areas to account for social
 
00:16:03.279 --> 00:16:06.949 align:start position:0%
um work areas to account for social
distancing

00:16:06.949 --> 00:16:06.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:11.030 --> 00:16:11.040 align:start position:0%
uh some some uh employers uh
 
00:16:15.189 --> 00:16:15.199 align:start position:0%
require or request testing of employees
 
00:16:17.829 --> 00:16:17.839 align:start position:0%
um all employers almost all i would
 
00:16:21.110 --> 00:16:21.120 align:start position:0%
expect if you're exposed to back uh to a
 
00:16:22.710 --> 00:16:22.720 align:start position:0%
covid uh
 
00:16:26.310 --> 00:16:26.320 align:start position:0%
an individual with covid19 there are um
 
00:16:30.230 --> 00:16:30.240 align:start position:0%
quarantine requirements so there are a
 
00:16:33.430 --> 00:16:33.440 align:start position:0%
number of ways and i'm not suggesting
 
00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:35.030 align:start position:0%
number of ways and i'm not suggesting
that

00:16:35.030 --> 00:16:35.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:16:38.389 --> 00:16:38.399 align:start position:0%
uh employers want to
 
00:16:41.269 --> 00:16:41.279 align:start position:0%
uh implement a vaccine mandate so they
 
00:16:43.350 --> 00:16:43.360 align:start position:0%
can do away with those other
 
00:16:46.550 --> 00:16:46.560 align:start position:0%
things i think everything contributes to
 
00:16:49.430 --> 00:16:49.440 align:start position:0%
reducing the transmission of covet 19 in
 
00:16:50.949 --> 00:16:50.959 align:start position:0%
the workplace
 
00:16:53.670 --> 00:16:53.680 align:start position:0%
okay thank you and um with that it is a
 
00:16:55.430 --> 00:16:55.440 align:start position:0%
significant impact to business
 
00:16:58.069 --> 00:16:58.079 align:start position:0%
operations to have a employee out for a
 
00:17:01.910 --> 00:17:01.920 align:start position:0%
time period like that yes
 
00:17:04.630 --> 00:17:04.640 align:start position:0%
i talked to a recent manufacturer
 
00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:05.990 align:start position:0%
i talked to a recent manufacturer
who

00:17:05.990 --> 00:17:06.000 align:start position:0%
who
 
00:17:07.909 --> 00:17:07.919 align:start position:0%
uh interestingly the conversation
 
00:17:09.669 --> 00:17:09.679 align:start position:0%
started because they had con they're a
 
00:17:11.510 --> 00:17:11.520 align:start position:0%
manufacturer of more than 100 employees
 
00:17:13.990 --> 00:17:14.000 align:start position:0%
and they're anticipating being under the
 
00:17:16.150 --> 00:17:16.160 align:start position:0%
requirement of the uh presidential
 
00:17:18.230 --> 00:17:18.240 align:start position:0%
executive order and they had a lot of
 
00:17:19.829 --> 00:17:19.839 align:start position:0%
concerns about that
 
00:17:19.839 --> 00:17:21.110 align:start position:0%
concerns about that
um

00:17:21.110 --> 00:17:21.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:17:23.750 --> 00:17:23.760 align:start position:0%
and in this particular workplace i'd ask
 
00:17:25.429 --> 00:17:25.439 align:start position:0%
them well how are you
 
00:17:28.710 --> 00:17:28.720 align:start position:0%
dealing with with the pandemic now and
 
00:17:31.029 --> 00:17:31.039 align:start position:0%
he says well we're not really
 
00:17:33.669 --> 00:17:33.679 align:start position:0%
taking a position one way or the other
 
00:17:36.070 --> 00:17:36.080 align:start position:0%
we're allowing our employee employees to
 
00:17:39.270 --> 00:17:39.280 align:start position:0%
make their own decisions about this
 
00:17:41.110 --> 00:17:41.120 align:start position:0%
and i said well how's that going he goes
 
00:17:43.750 --> 00:17:43.760 align:start position:0%
well we've we've had instances of
 
00:17:43.760 --> 00:17:45.669 align:start position:0%
well we've we've had instances of
[Music]

00:17:45.669 --> 00:17:45.679 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:17:48.070 --> 00:17:48.080 align:start position:0%
employees getting coveted 19 and being
 
00:17:50.390 --> 00:17:50.400 align:start position:0%
out he also said they had two employees
 
00:17:53.430 --> 00:17:53.440 align:start position:0%
who have died from covet 19 related
 
00:17:53.440 --> 00:17:54.470 align:start position:0%
who have died from covet 19 related
reasons

00:17:54.470 --> 00:17:54.480 align:start position:0%
reasons
 
00:17:54.480 --> 00:17:55.990 align:start position:0%
reasons
so

00:17:55.990 --> 00:17:56.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:17:59.590 --> 00:17:59.600 align:start position:0%
it certainly impacts employers in
 
00:18:02.870 --> 00:18:02.880 align:start position:0%
some ways in the worst ways possible
 
00:18:04.950 --> 00:18:04.960 align:start position:0%
and so with that you you believe that it
 
00:18:07.990 --> 00:18:08.000 align:start position:0%
is appropriate to require a medical
 
00:18:10.630 --> 00:18:10.640 align:start position:0%
intervention for a patient that extends
 
00:18:12.630 --> 00:18:12.640 align:start position:0%
past working hours that prevents those
 
00:18:15.350 --> 00:18:15.360 align:start position:0%
disruptions to business
 
00:18:17.590 --> 00:18:17.600 align:start position:0%
um i
 
00:18:21.669 --> 00:18:21.679 align:start position:0%
honestly am not an expert on medical
 
00:18:23.990 --> 00:18:24.000 align:start position:0%
interventions what i'm requesting this
 
00:18:26.070 --> 00:18:26.080 align:start position:0%
committee to consider
 
00:18:29.190 --> 00:18:29.200 align:start position:0%
is giving employers the the ability
 
00:18:29.200 --> 00:18:29.990 align:start position:0%
is giving employers the the ability
to

00:18:29.990 --> 00:18:30.000 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:18:33.029 --> 00:18:33.039 align:start position:0%
implement uh health uh health and safety
 
00:18:34.870 --> 00:18:34.880 align:start position:0%
measures that they deem appropriate for
 
00:18:36.230 --> 00:18:36.240 align:start position:0%
their workplace
 
00:18:38.710 --> 00:18:38.720 align:start position:0%
okay so with that you would it would be
 
00:18:41.190 --> 00:18:41.200 align:start position:0%
appropriate for an employer in a tight
 
00:18:43.110 --> 00:18:43.120 align:start position:0%
labor market with a hard time getting
 
00:18:44.950 --> 00:18:44.960 align:start position:0%
employees to require their female
 
00:18:47.110 --> 00:18:47.120 align:start position:0%
employees to be on birth control in
 
00:18:48.789 --> 00:18:48.799 align:start position:0%
order to prevent the disruption because
 
00:18:52.390 --> 00:18:52.400 align:start position:0%
that's also a disruption to the business
 
00:18:55.510 --> 00:18:55.520 align:start position:0%
that is something that i don't think any
 
00:18:57.590 --> 00:18:57.600 align:start position:0%
employer i've ever heard of even
 
00:18:59.029 --> 00:18:59.039 align:start position:0%
considering so
 
00:18:59.039 --> 00:19:02.310 align:start position:0%
considering so
it's

00:19:02.310 --> 00:19:02.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:02.320 --> 00:19:03.110 align:start position:0%
 
it

00:19:03.110 --> 00:19:03.120 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:19:05.270 --> 00:19:05.280 align:start position:0%
it's just i can't even respond to that
 
00:19:08.470 --> 00:19:08.480 align:start position:0%
because it's it's just not
 
00:19:13.590 --> 00:19:13.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:15.190 --> 00:19:15.200 align:start position:0%
we also hadn't considered this sort of
 
00:19:17.510 --> 00:19:17.520 align:start position:0%
thing in the past before of most uh
 
00:19:17.520 --> 00:19:18.470 align:start position:0%
thing in the past before of most uh
um

00:19:18.470 --> 00:19:18.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:19:20.630 --> 00:19:20.640 align:start position:0%
and and also i guess my last question is
 
00:19:23.270 --> 00:19:23.280 align:start position:0%
this is not a sterilizing vaccine and to
 
00:19:25.029 --> 00:19:25.039 align:start position:0%
the people who are worried about the
 
00:19:26.630 --> 00:19:26.640 align:start position:0%
reproductive issues that's not what i
 
00:19:29.029 --> 00:19:29.039 align:start position:0%
mean scientifically a sterilizing
 
00:19:30.230 --> 00:19:30.240 align:start position:0%
vaccine is one that prevents
 
00:19:31.669 --> 00:19:31.679 align:start position:0%
transmission and while we know it
 
00:19:33.590 --> 00:19:33.600 align:start position:0%
reduces it it doesn't prevent it
 
00:19:35.990 --> 00:19:36.000 align:start position:0%
entirely so you believe that
 
00:19:38.310 --> 00:19:38.320 align:start position:0%
having a vaccine something that they
 
00:19:39.830 --> 00:19:39.840 align:start position:0%
can't take off at the end of the shift
 
00:19:41.990 --> 00:19:42.000 align:start position:0%
like you would with a hard hat or a seat
 
00:19:44.230 --> 00:19:44.240 align:start position:0%
belt is an appropriate request for the
 
00:19:44.240 --> 00:19:45.270 align:start position:0%
belt is an appropriate request for the
employees

00:19:45.270 --> 00:19:45.280 align:start position:0%
employees
 
00:19:46.789 --> 00:19:46.799 align:start position:0%
i believe employers should have the
 
00:19:49.350 --> 00:19:49.360 align:start position:0%
ability to implement
 
00:19:50.950 --> 00:19:50.960 align:start position:0%
health and safety measures that they
 
00:19:52.870 --> 00:19:52.880 align:start position:0%
deem in the best interest of the health
 
00:19:54.630 --> 00:19:54.640 align:start position:0%
and safety of their employees and the
 
00:19:57.909 --> 00:19:57.919 align:start position:0%
workplace and honestly representative if
 
00:20:02.070 --> 00:20:02.080 align:start position:0%
an employee feels that strongly about it
 
00:20:03.669 --> 00:20:03.679 align:start position:0%
they will
 
00:20:05.510 --> 00:20:05.520 align:start position:0%
would have to find other employment if
 
00:20:08.390 --> 00:20:08.400 align:start position:0%
they don't qualify for a medical or a
 
00:20:11.029 --> 00:20:11.039 align:start position:0%
religious exemption
 
00:20:12.310 --> 00:20:12.320 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:20:14.310 --> 00:20:14.320 align:start position:0%
thank you david anybody else i have a
 
00:20:16.710 --> 00:20:16.720 align:start position:0%
couple questions so so david i just want
 
00:20:18.230 --> 00:20:18.240 align:start position:0%
to make sure i understand part of what
 
00:20:19.750 --> 00:20:19.760 align:start position:0%
you're saying and just rephrase it and
 
00:20:21.590 --> 00:20:21.600 align:start position:0%
see if i'm clear but
 
00:20:26.070 --> 00:20:26.080 align:start position:0%
um it sounds like it's you're not um
 
00:20:27.190 --> 00:20:27.200 align:start position:0%
you just want employees to have the
 
00:20:29.590 --> 00:20:29.600 align:start position:0%
flexibility either to or not to right
 
00:20:30.630 --> 00:20:30.640 align:start position:0%
that you don't think it should be a
 
00:20:32.630 --> 00:20:32.640 align:start position:0%
mandate across the entire organization
 
00:20:34.870 --> 00:20:34.880 align:start position:0%
and industry but you're the flexibility
 
00:20:37.270 --> 00:20:37.280 align:start position:0%
for an individual employer to decide
 
00:20:39.190 --> 00:20:39.200 align:start position:0%
whether or not it's good for their
 
00:20:39.200 --> 00:20:40.230 align:start position:0%
whether or not it's good for their
business

00:20:40.230 --> 00:20:40.240 align:start position:0%
business
 
00:20:42.149 --> 00:20:42.159 align:start position:0%
and be able to implement if they choose
 
00:20:43.990 --> 00:20:44.000 align:start position:0%
is that is that your testimony correct
 
00:20:45.830 --> 00:20:45.840 align:start position:0%
and if i could add to that
 
00:20:47.669 --> 00:20:47.679 align:start position:0%
uh some
 
00:20:49.830 --> 00:20:49.840 align:start position:0%
with with the uh
 
00:20:51.990 --> 00:20:52.000 align:start position:0%
promulgation of the federal or the
 
00:20:53.909 --> 00:20:53.919 align:start position:0%
presidential executive order a lot of
 
00:20:57.190 --> 00:20:57.200 align:start position:0%
people asked where bia felt on that
 
00:20:59.590 --> 00:20:59.600 align:start position:0%
and and the reality is we have some
 
00:21:02.310 --> 00:21:02.320 align:start position:0%
concerns about that also because that's
 
00:21:02.320 --> 00:21:03.350 align:start position:0%
concerns about that also because that's
uh

00:21:03.350 --> 00:21:03.360 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:21:05.990 --> 00:21:06.000 align:start position:0%
forcing uh something on employers from
 
00:21:07.909 --> 00:21:07.919 align:start position:0%
from the other direction
 
00:21:07.919 --> 00:21:08.950 align:start position:0%
from the other direction
um

00:21:08.950 --> 00:21:08.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:21:11.510 --> 00:21:11.520 align:start position:0%
we're awaiting as as most employers in
 
00:21:13.990 --> 00:21:14.000 align:start position:0%
the state are for the
 
00:21:17.110 --> 00:21:17.120 align:start position:0%
rules the draft interim rules to be
 
00:21:19.270 --> 00:21:19.280 align:start position:0%
promulgated by osha
 
00:21:21.590 --> 00:21:21.600 align:start position:0%
but we fully intend to comment on them
 
00:21:23.270 --> 00:21:23.280 align:start position:0%
and i'll give you an example what we've
 
00:21:25.750 --> 00:21:25.760 align:start position:0%
heard from some of our members
 
00:21:25.760 --> 00:21:27.029 align:start position:0%
heard from some of our members
with

00:21:27.029 --> 00:21:27.039 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:21:29.350 --> 00:21:29.360 align:start position:0%
more than 100 employees they they don't
 
00:21:31.990 --> 00:21:32.000 align:start position:0%
understand why they're being singled out
 
00:21:34.870 --> 00:21:34.880 align:start position:0%
and they don't understand why employers
 
00:21:36.789 --> 00:21:36.799 align:start position:0%
of 90 people
 
00:21:38.630 --> 00:21:38.640 align:start position:0%
aren't aren't those employees in the
 
00:21:41.110 --> 00:21:41.120 align:start position:0%
workplace at the same risk so
 
00:21:43.430 --> 00:21:43.440 align:start position:0%
there's concern coming from both
 
00:21:43.440 --> 00:21:45.350 align:start position:0%
there's concern coming from both
directions

00:21:45.350 --> 00:21:45.360 align:start position:0%
directions
 
00:21:47.430 --> 00:21:47.440 align:start position:0%
so again if i understood that right
 
00:21:49.029 --> 00:21:49.039 align:start position:0%
you're not exactly in favor of the
 
00:21:50.470 --> 00:21:50.480 align:start position:0%
federal mandates that are coming down
 
00:21:52.230 --> 00:21:52.240 align:start position:0%
but you believe that as an individual
 
00:21:53.590 --> 00:21:53.600 align:start position:0%
employer they should be able to make a
 
00:21:55.750 --> 00:21:55.760 align:start position:0%
mandate if they choose yeah we're not to
 
00:21:58.149 --> 00:21:58.159 align:start position:0%
leave that flexibility our position
 
00:22:00.149 --> 00:22:00.159 align:start position:0%
right now is we are not opposed to the
 
00:22:01.669 --> 00:22:01.679 align:start position:0%
federal mandate but we have not
 
00:22:03.190 --> 00:22:03.200 align:start position:0%
indicated that we're in favor of it
 
00:22:06.070 --> 00:22:06.080 align:start position:0%
either and we will likely be uh
 
00:22:08.789 --> 00:22:08.799 align:start position:0%
commenting on the osha proposed rules
 
00:22:11.190 --> 00:22:11.200 align:start position:0%
during the public comment period okay a
 
00:22:13.110 --> 00:22:13.120 align:start position:0%
couple follow-up questions so are you at
 
00:22:15.190 --> 00:22:15.200 align:start position:0%
all concerned for your businesses given
 
00:22:17.190 --> 00:22:17.200 align:start position:0%
the fact that the federal immunity
 
00:22:19.430 --> 00:22:19.440 align:start position:0%
portion of of of we're going to talk
 
00:22:20.710 --> 00:22:20.720 align:start position:0%
about vaccinations because that's what
 
00:22:21.669 --> 00:22:21.679 align:start position:0%
we're talking about mandates and
 
00:22:24.390 --> 00:22:24.400 align:start position:0%
vaccinations um that that given broad
 
00:22:25.750 --> 00:22:25.760 align:start position:0%
immunity that the federal government's
 
00:22:28.710 --> 00:22:28.720 align:start position:0%
given the vaccine manufacturers
 
00:22:32.230 --> 00:22:32.240 align:start position:0%
that any death or injuries that result
 
00:22:35.110 --> 00:22:35.120 align:start position:0%
as a as it relates to these vaccines in
 
00:22:36.789 --> 00:22:36.799 align:start position:0%
your business mandate that that
 
00:22:38.710 --> 00:22:38.720 align:start position:0%
liability may somehow rest on your
 
00:22:40.549 --> 00:22:40.559 align:start position:0%
businesses that those businesses would
 
00:22:42.630 --> 00:22:42.640 align:start position:0%
be subject to that that a employee can
 
00:22:44.950 --> 00:22:44.960 align:start position:0%
sue because you chose to mandate
 
00:22:47.029 --> 00:22:47.039 align:start position:0%
a vaccine and that resulted in injury
 
00:22:48.470 --> 00:22:48.480 align:start position:0%
that it's your responsibility because
 
00:22:49.750 --> 00:22:49.760 align:start position:0%
they can't go upstream because the
 
00:22:51.430 --> 00:22:51.440 align:start position:0%
manufacturers have
 
00:22:53.990 --> 00:22:54.000 align:start position:0%
the vaccine manufacturers have liability
 
00:22:57.110 --> 00:22:57.120 align:start position:0%
of coverage so they're they're immuno
 
00:22:59.350 --> 00:22:59.360 align:start position:0%
immunized for lack for metaphase
 
00:23:02.470 --> 00:23:02.480 align:start position:0%
yeah i don't have a very good way of
 
00:23:05.590 --> 00:23:05.600 align:start position:0%
responding in a knowledgeable fashion to
 
00:23:07.909 --> 00:23:07.919 align:start position:0%
whether employers would be at risk for
 
00:23:10.230 --> 00:23:10.240 align:start position:0%
liability i can tell you that they're
 
00:23:13.029 --> 00:23:13.039 align:start position:0%
already at risk for liability
 
00:23:15.430 --> 00:23:15.440 align:start position:0%
from employees or members of the public
 
00:23:17.270 --> 00:23:17.280 align:start position:0%
that are in the workplace customers or
 
00:23:17.280 --> 00:23:18.870 align:start position:0%
that are in the workplace customers or
suppliers

00:23:18.870 --> 00:23:18.880 align:start position:0%
suppliers
 
00:23:21.750 --> 00:23:21.760 align:start position:0%
if if those individuals get coveted 19
 
00:23:23.270 --> 00:23:23.280 align:start position:0%
and they feel it was because of
 
00:23:24.789 --> 00:23:24.799 align:start position:0%
something that the
 
00:23:27.430 --> 00:23:27.440 align:start position:0%
employer didn't do that that should have
 
00:23:30.950 --> 00:23:30.960 align:start position:0%
done and many of you know we
 
00:23:33.430 --> 00:23:33.440 align:start position:0%
supported legislation last year to
 
00:23:35.990 --> 00:23:36.000 align:start position:0%
create what we call a safe harbor for
 
00:23:37.909 --> 00:23:37.919 align:start position:0%
employers who are doing the right thing
 
00:23:40.310 --> 00:23:40.320 align:start position:0%
following cdc guidelines and federal and
 
00:23:42.390 --> 00:23:42.400 align:start position:0%
state health and safety guidelines
 
00:23:42.400 --> 00:23:43.110 align:start position:0%
state health and safety guidelines
to

00:23:43.110 --> 00:23:43.120 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:23:45.750 --> 00:23:45.760 align:start position:0%
ensure as safe a work for a workplace as
 
00:23:47.909 --> 00:23:47.919 align:start position:0%
possible but that legislation didn't
 
00:23:49.430 --> 00:23:49.440 align:start position:0%
didn't make it through
 
00:23:51.830 --> 00:23:51.840 align:start position:0%
so i think employers
 
00:23:55.830 --> 00:23:55.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:58.710 --> 00:23:58.720 align:start position:0%
at risk of being held liable for things
 
00:24:01.430 --> 00:24:01.440 align:start position:0%
related to covet 19.
 
00:24:02.870 --> 00:24:02.880 align:start position:0%
so again if i can rephrase to make sure
 
00:24:06.230 --> 00:24:06.240 align:start position:0%
i i understand shorten that answer up so
 
00:24:07.430 --> 00:24:07.440 align:start position:0%
it sounds like you're saying there's
 
00:24:09.110 --> 00:24:09.120 align:start position:0%
liability on both sides whether they
 
00:24:10.870 --> 00:24:10.880 align:start position:0%
mandate or don't mandate there's there's
 
00:24:12.950 --> 00:24:12.960 align:start position:0%
potential liability i would guess so but
 
00:24:14.549 --> 00:24:14.559 align:start position:0%
you're getting that answer from a
 
00:24:16.310 --> 00:24:16.320 align:start position:0%
non-lawyer with no experience in
 
00:24:18.390 --> 00:24:18.400 align:start position:0%
liability litigation
 
00:24:20.230 --> 00:24:20.240 align:start position:0%
so i'm going to switch over and ask
 
00:24:23.190 --> 00:24:23.200 align:start position:0%
questions around um
 
00:24:25.830 --> 00:24:25.840 align:start position:0%
the mandate mandates and and business
 
00:24:28.870 --> 00:24:28.880 align:start position:0%
and how they relate to exemptions right
 
00:24:28.880 --> 00:24:29.990 align:start position:0%
and how they relate to exemptions right
so

00:24:29.990 --> 00:24:30.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:30.950 align:start position:0%
so
um

00:24:30.950 --> 00:24:30.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:24:32.390 --> 00:24:32.400 align:start position:0%
the question i i
 
00:24:34.789 --> 00:24:34.799 align:start position:0%
asked yesterday and i'll ask again today
 
00:24:36.390 --> 00:24:36.400 align:start position:0%
is around when i'm gonna use religious
 
00:24:37.990 --> 00:24:38.000 align:start position:0%
exemptions first because they're the
 
00:24:41.430 --> 00:24:41.440 align:start position:0%
easiest to understand um recently the um
 
00:24:43.750 --> 00:24:43.760 align:start position:0%
surgeon generals come out and said that
 
00:24:45.750 --> 00:24:45.760 align:start position:0%
they think the religious exemptions are
 
00:24:47.510 --> 00:24:47.520 align:start position:0%
being abused and you should be
 
00:24:50.230 --> 00:24:50.240 align:start position:0%
investigated further which put pressure
 
00:24:53.830 --> 00:24:53.840 align:start position:0%
on businesses to either investigate more
 
00:24:55.430 --> 00:24:55.440 align:start position:0%
or to outright deny them because it's
 
00:24:57.110 --> 00:24:57.120 align:start position:0%
just you know they don't want to undergo
 
00:24:58.630 --> 00:24:58.640 align:start position:0%
that so i guess my question is is
 
00:25:01.110 --> 00:25:01.120 align:start position:0%
appropriate for business to be in the
 
00:25:02.870 --> 00:25:02.880 align:start position:0%
place of having decide whether a
 
00:25:05.590 --> 00:25:05.600 align:start position:0%
person's religious enough to be entitled
 
00:25:07.909 --> 00:25:07.919 align:start position:0%
to an exemption or would it be better if
 
00:25:09.669 --> 00:25:09.679 align:start position:0%
somehow we clean that up to make it so
 
00:25:12.390 --> 00:25:12.400 align:start position:0%
your statute your businesses would have
 
00:25:14.070 --> 00:25:14.080 align:start position:0%
something to fall back on for granting a
 
00:25:16.710 --> 00:25:16.720 align:start position:0%
religious exemption i um
 
00:25:18.630 --> 00:25:18.640 align:start position:0%
the religious exemption may be the most
 
00:25:20.390 --> 00:25:20.400 align:start position:0%
easily understood but it's probably the
 
00:25:23.430 --> 00:25:23.440 align:start position:0%
most difficult for an employer to to
 
00:25:25.510 --> 00:25:25.520 align:start position:0%
deal with um
 
00:25:27.590 --> 00:25:27.600 align:start position:0%
a medical exemption is pretty pretty cut
 
00:25:30.310 --> 00:25:30.320 align:start position:0%
and dried if you are able to provide uh
 
00:25:32.710 --> 00:25:32.720 align:start position:0%
some documentation from from a physician
 
00:25:34.549 --> 00:25:34.559 align:start position:0%
indicating that there is a medical
 
00:25:36.470 --> 00:25:36.480 align:start position:0%
reason why you shouldn't have to receive
 
00:25:38.310 --> 00:25:38.320 align:start position:0%
a vaccination that's pretty black and
 
00:25:38.320 --> 00:25:39.110 align:start position:0%
a vaccination that's pretty black and
white

00:25:39.110 --> 00:25:39.120 align:start position:0%
white
 
00:25:41.830 --> 00:25:41.840 align:start position:0%
a religious exemption is obviously a lot
 
00:25:43.909 --> 00:25:43.919 align:start position:0%
greater and it does concern a lot of
 
00:25:43.919 --> 00:25:45.990 align:start position:0%
greater and it does concern a lot of
employers

00:25:45.990 --> 00:25:46.000 align:start position:0%
employers
 
00:25:48.470 --> 00:25:48.480 align:start position:0%
and i don't i suspect how employers
 
00:25:52.710 --> 00:25:52.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:54.950 --> 00:25:54.960 align:start position:0%
from employer to employer
 
00:25:59.990 --> 00:26:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:02.390 --> 00:26:02.400 align:start position:0%
action from from new hampshire's
 
00:26:04.549 --> 00:26:04.559 align:start position:0%
uh commission on civil rights if the
 
00:26:07.350 --> 00:26:07.360 align:start position:0%
employee feels that they're being
 
00:26:09.590 --> 00:26:09.600 align:start position:0%
discriminated against because of their
 
00:26:11.590 --> 00:26:11.600 align:start position:0%
our religion they can
 
00:26:14.149 --> 00:26:14.159 align:start position:0%
file a claim with with the commission
 
00:26:16.630 --> 00:26:16.640 align:start position:0%
and that's a risk that employers are
 
00:26:18.390 --> 00:26:18.400 align:start position:0%
cognizant of
 
00:26:21.430 --> 00:26:21.440 align:start position:0%
and i don't i i don't
 
00:26:23.190 --> 00:26:23.200 align:start position:0%
i can't say how employers are going to
 
00:26:26.070 --> 00:26:26.080 align:start position:0%
respond to that particular exemption
 
00:26:28.950 --> 00:26:28.960 align:start position:0%
other than it's one that is generally
 
00:26:30.950 --> 00:26:30.960 align:start position:0%
acknowledged as being
 
00:26:33.510 --> 00:26:33.520 align:start position:0%
something that employers would certainly
 
00:26:33.520 --> 00:26:35.269 align:start position:0%
something that employers would certainly
consider

00:26:35.269 --> 00:26:35.279 align:start position:0%
consider
 
00:26:38.390 --> 00:26:38.400 align:start position:0%
in terms of providing an exemption
 
00:26:40.789 --> 00:26:40.799 align:start position:0%
and so go going to the medical again i
 
00:26:42.710 --> 00:26:42.720 align:start position:0%
i'm thinking that again the same thing
 
00:26:45.190 --> 00:26:45.200 align:start position:0%
is it would it be easier for employers
 
00:26:47.350 --> 00:26:47.360 align:start position:0%
um or or is it
 
00:26:48.710 --> 00:26:48.720 align:start position:0%
tough for employers because you have to
 
00:26:50.390 --> 00:26:50.400 align:start position:0%
open up a medical chart and give here's
 
00:26:51.750 --> 00:26:51.760 align:start position:0%
the reasons why and then make a
 
00:26:53.909 --> 00:26:53.919 align:start position:0%
determination whether that my natural
 
00:26:56.230 --> 00:26:56.240 align:start position:0%
path as compared to my regular m general
 
00:26:58.310 --> 00:26:58.320 align:start position:0%
practitioner who signed one how does
 
00:26:59.990 --> 00:27:00.000 align:start position:0%
that interplay and is that a real doctor
 
00:27:02.549 --> 00:27:02.559 align:start position:0%
not a real doctor is it a you know
 
00:27:04.390 --> 00:27:04.400 align:start position:0%
you know who signed it was it you know
 
00:27:06.789 --> 00:27:06.799 align:start position:0%
so putting the industry in that position
 
00:27:09.190 --> 00:27:09.200 align:start position:0%
of making those determinations is that
 
00:27:10.710 --> 00:27:10.720 align:start position:0%
again is that something the industry
 
00:27:12.789 --> 00:27:12.799 align:start position:0%
wants or would it be better to have some
 
00:27:14.950 --> 00:27:14.960 align:start position:0%
sort of clarity around that i i don't
 
00:27:17.190 --> 00:27:17.200 align:start position:0%
know if it's something industry wants i
 
00:27:19.269 --> 00:27:19.279 align:start position:0%
think it's just an acknowledgement there
 
00:27:21.350 --> 00:27:21.360 align:start position:0%
are going to be reasons
 
00:27:25.029 --> 00:27:25.039 align:start position:0%
reasonable reasons why an individual may
 
00:27:27.430 --> 00:27:27.440 align:start position:0%
feel that they should be exempted
 
00:27:27.440 --> 00:27:28.310 align:start position:0%
feel that they should be exempted
from

00:27:28.310 --> 00:27:28.320 align:start position:0%
from
 
00:27:30.549 --> 00:27:30.559 align:start position:0%
having to to
 
00:27:32.230 --> 00:27:32.240 align:start position:0%
receive a vaccine and employers
 
00:27:35.590 --> 00:27:35.600 align:start position:0%
understand that how that plays out i
 
00:27:38.070 --> 00:27:38.080 align:start position:0%
don't really know at this point and like
 
00:27:39.190 --> 00:27:39.200 align:start position:0%
i said it may
 
00:27:42.070 --> 00:27:42.080 align:start position:0%
differ from employer to employer
 
00:27:45.510 --> 00:27:45.520 align:start position:0%
but i think we i think again if
 
00:27:47.590 --> 00:27:47.600 align:start position:0%
in the conversation
 
00:27:49.029 --> 00:27:49.039 align:start position:0%
we agree that there's some liability
 
00:27:50.470 --> 00:27:50.480 align:start position:0%
attached there
 
00:27:51.909 --> 00:27:51.919 align:start position:0%
uh correct that again in the case of a
 
00:27:54.710 --> 00:27:54.720 align:start position:0%
religious exemption right that's denied
 
00:27:56.149 --> 00:27:56.159 align:start position:0%
right there's a civil rights action that
 
00:27:58.470 --> 00:27:58.480 align:start position:0%
could potentially be brought forward um
 
00:27:59.750 --> 00:27:59.760 align:start position:0%
and and so
 
00:28:02.549 --> 00:28:02.559 align:start position:0%
clarity proud that probably a good idea
 
00:28:04.310 --> 00:28:04.320 align:start position:0%
i i
 
00:28:06.710 --> 00:28:06.720 align:start position:0%
would agree that clarity is probably a
 
00:28:10.230 --> 00:28:10.240 align:start position:0%
good idea i'm not willing to sign on to
 
00:28:12.470 --> 00:28:12.480 align:start position:0%
anything just because it makes it
 
00:28:14.470 --> 00:28:14.480 align:start position:0%
clearer understood
 
00:28:18.310 --> 00:28:18.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:19.430 --> 00:28:19.440 align:start position:0%
thank you dave
 
00:28:21.269 --> 00:28:21.279 align:start position:0%
erica go ahead oh thank you if i can
 
00:28:22.789 --> 00:28:22.799 align:start position:0%
actually circle back to those limited
 
00:28:25.350 --> 00:28:25.360 align:start position:0%
liability bills um i we had heard one of
 
00:28:28.070 --> 00:28:28.080 align:start position:0%
those in education where i sat last year
 
00:28:29.669 --> 00:28:29.679 align:start position:0%
my question to you i know you're not a
 
00:28:29.679 --> 00:28:30.470 align:start position:0%
my question to you i know you're not a
lawyer

00:28:30.470 --> 00:28:30.480 align:start position:0%
lawyer
 
00:28:32.870 --> 00:28:32.880 align:start position:0%
but uh following the guidelines put out
 
00:28:35.990 --> 00:28:36.000 align:start position:0%
by the cdc um would would have protected
 
00:28:38.630 --> 00:28:38.640 align:start position:0%
the employers from any liability in the
 
00:28:42.230 --> 00:28:42.240 align:start position:0%
bill as initially introduced would
 
00:28:44.070 --> 00:28:44.080 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i wanted to let you finish
 
00:28:46.070 --> 00:28:46.080 align:start position:0%
okay sorry i thought you were saying um
 
00:28:48.310 --> 00:28:48.320 align:start position:0%
so it would have protected any employers
 
00:28:50.310 --> 00:28:50.320 align:start position:0%
from liability if they followed cdc
 
00:28:52.470 --> 00:28:52.480 align:start position:0%
guidelines and the cdc guidelines are
 
00:28:55.669 --> 00:28:55.679 align:start position:0%
for vaccination is would that have
 
00:28:57.750 --> 00:28:57.760 align:start position:0%
essentially placed a mandate on
 
00:28:57.760 --> 00:28:58.950 align:start position:0%
essentially placed a mandate on
employers

00:28:58.950 --> 00:28:58.960 align:start position:0%
employers
 
00:29:01.510 --> 00:29:01.520 align:start position:0%
through in order to avoid that liability
 
00:29:01.520 --> 00:29:02.789 align:start position:0%
through in order to avoid that liability
risk

00:29:02.789 --> 00:29:02.799 align:start position:0%
risk
 
00:29:02.799 --> 00:29:04.470 align:start position:0%
risk
um

00:29:04.470 --> 00:29:04.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:29:05.430 --> 00:29:05.440 align:start position:0%
are you
 
00:29:08.710 --> 00:29:08.720 align:start position:0%
asking if the cdc had
 
00:29:12.230 --> 00:29:12.240 align:start position:0%
a vaccine mandate because they don't
 
00:29:14.789 --> 00:29:14.799 align:start position:0%
no not a mandate but the way that the
 
00:29:17.029 --> 00:29:17.039 align:start position:0%
limited liability bill was written it
 
00:29:19.110 --> 00:29:19.120 align:start position:0%
said that employers who are following
 
00:29:22.710 --> 00:29:22.720 align:start position:0%
the guidelines put set forth by the cdc
 
00:29:24.070 --> 00:29:24.080 align:start position:0%
will be
 
00:29:27.269 --> 00:29:27.279 align:start position:0%
will not have liability and
 
00:29:27.279 --> 00:29:28.230 align:start position:0%
will not have liability and
yes

00:29:28.230 --> 00:29:28.240 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:29:31.269 --> 00:29:31.279 align:start position:0%
the cdc and others other federal or
 
00:29:33.830 --> 00:29:33.840 align:start position:0%
state health and safety guidelines
 
00:29:36.549 --> 00:29:36.559 align:start position:0%
except in cases of gross negligence if
 
00:29:37.990 --> 00:29:38.000 align:start position:0%
there was an employer that was just
 
00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:39.190 align:start position:0%
there was an employer that was just
ignoring

00:29:39.190 --> 00:29:39.200 align:start position:0%
ignoring
 
00:29:41.590 --> 00:29:41.600 align:start position:0%
everything and saying the heck with it
 
00:29:45.669 --> 00:29:45.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:48.950 --> 00:29:48.960 align:start position:0%
subject to potential litigation relating
 
00:29:50.630 --> 00:29:50.640 align:start position:0%
to that
 
00:29:52.870 --> 00:29:52.880 align:start position:0%
so it was only for gross negligence not
 
00:29:54.789 --> 00:29:54.799 align:start position:0%
for businesses who weren't following the
 
00:29:56.630 --> 00:29:56.640 align:start position:0%
guidelines the
 
00:29:58.310 --> 00:29:58.320 align:start position:0%
no the exact opposite i think if i
 
00:30:00.950 --> 00:30:00.960 align:start position:0%
understood you the the safe harbor
 
00:30:03.110 --> 00:30:03.120 align:start position:0%
was for those employers who were making
 
00:30:05.510 --> 00:30:05.520 align:start position:0%
good faith efforts to follow
 
00:30:07.590 --> 00:30:07.600 align:start position:0%
federal and state guidelines it would
 
00:30:10.230 --> 00:30:10.240 align:start position:0%
not have provided a safe harbor for
 
00:30:10.240 --> 00:30:11.590 align:start position:0%
not have provided a safe harbor for
employers

00:30:11.590 --> 00:30:11.600 align:start position:0%
employers
 
00:30:14.149 --> 00:30:14.159 align:start position:0%
who were just grossly negligent and
 
00:30:16.230 --> 00:30:16.240 align:start position:0%
chose not to even make a good faith
 
00:30:17.669 --> 00:30:17.679 align:start position:0%
effort to comply
 
00:30:20.149 --> 00:30:20.159 align:start position:0%
right so i'd like your opinion on what a
 
00:30:22.470 --> 00:30:22.480 align:start position:0%
good faith effort is to have employees
 
00:30:24.710 --> 00:30:24.720 align:start position:0%
vaccinated when the cdc guidelines are
 
00:30:26.149 --> 00:30:26.159 align:start position:0%
to vaccinate
 
00:30:26.159 --> 00:30:27.430 align:start position:0%
to vaccinate
everybody

00:30:27.430 --> 00:30:27.440 align:start position:0%
everybody
 
00:30:29.269 --> 00:30:29.279 align:start position:0%
would it be a good faith effort where
 
00:30:30.789 --> 00:30:30.799 align:start position:0%
you just ask your employees to be
 
00:30:32.710 --> 00:30:32.720 align:start position:0%
vaccinated or would you need to take
 
00:30:34.630 --> 00:30:34.640 align:start position:0%
further steps in order to have that
 
00:30:38.070 --> 00:30:38.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:39.909 --> 00:30:39.919 align:start position:0%
well the shield of liability doesn't
 
00:30:41.669 --> 00:30:41.679 align:start position:0%
exist so
 
00:30:43.990 --> 00:30:44.000 align:start position:0%
um you know
 
00:30:45.909 --> 00:30:45.919 align:start position:0%
it's actually retained there are
 
00:30:48.470 --> 00:30:48.480 align:start position:0%
retained bills so it may come through
 
00:30:48.480 --> 00:30:49.430 align:start position:0%
retained bills so it may come through
perhaps

00:30:49.430 --> 00:30:49.440 align:start position:0%
perhaps
 
00:30:49.440 --> 00:30:55.750 align:start position:0%
perhaps
um

00:30:55.750 --> 00:30:55.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:57.190 --> 00:30:57.200 align:start position:0%
i think
 
00:30:59.909 --> 00:30:59.919 align:start position:0%
my understanding of the cdc guidelines
 
00:31:02.149 --> 00:31:02.159 align:start position:0%
is that they recognize
 
00:31:04.310 --> 00:31:04.320 align:start position:0%
and recommend that vaccinations are the
 
00:31:06.630 --> 00:31:06.640 align:start position:0%
best method for
 
00:31:09.029 --> 00:31:09.039 align:start position:0%
avoiding or preventing the spread of
 
00:31:10.870 --> 00:31:10.880 align:start position:0%
coven 19.
 
00:31:16.389 --> 00:31:16.399 align:start position:0%
and so i would think that employers who
 
00:31:17.669 --> 00:31:17.679 align:start position:0%
choose to
 
00:31:20.389 --> 00:31:20.399 align:start position:0%
may choose to have a vaccine
 
00:31:23.029 --> 00:31:23.039 align:start position:0%
mandate there's no requirement other
 
00:31:24.070 --> 00:31:24.080 align:start position:0%
than the
 
00:31:26.870 --> 00:31:26.880 align:start position:0%
presidential executive employer a
 
00:31:28.710 --> 00:31:28.720 align:start position:0%
presidential executive order on
 
00:31:30.789 --> 00:31:30.799 align:start position:0%
employers of 100 or more or those with
 
00:31:33.830 --> 00:31:33.840 align:start position:0%
federal contracts to implement a vaccine
 
00:31:35.909 --> 00:31:35.919 align:start position:0%
mandate so i i'm
 
00:31:38.549 --> 00:31:38.559 align:start position:0%
not sure i see
 
00:31:41.029 --> 00:31:41.039 align:start position:0%
a correlation between whether employers
 
00:31:43.430 --> 00:31:43.440 align:start position:0%
choose to have a mandate or not as
 
00:31:46.310 --> 00:31:46.320 align:start position:0%
acting in a good faith effort um it
 
00:31:47.990 --> 00:31:48.000 align:start position:0%
sounded like you just said that having a
 
00:31:50.230 --> 00:31:50.240 align:start position:0%
mandate would be a shield if those if
 
00:31:52.230 --> 00:31:52.240 align:start position:0%
those laws that were those uh bills that
 
00:31:54.710 --> 00:31:54.720 align:start position:0%
are retained went into action
 
00:31:56.389 --> 00:31:56.399 align:start position:0%
do you belie do you believe that having
 
00:31:58.070 --> 00:31:58.080 align:start position:0%
a mandate would protect them from that
 
00:32:00.470 --> 00:32:00.480 align:start position:0%
liability if these laws pass
 
00:32:02.389 --> 00:32:02.399 align:start position:0%
i believe it is something that they
 
00:32:04.310 --> 00:32:04.320 align:start position:0%
could use to demonstrate that they're
 
00:32:07.110 --> 00:32:07.120 align:start position:0%
making a good faith effort
 
00:32:08.789 --> 00:32:08.799 align:start position:0%
i think they could
 
00:32:11.350 --> 00:32:11.360 align:start position:0%
use if they're conducting education
 
00:32:13.590 --> 00:32:13.600 align:start position:0%
programs about the efficacy of vaccines
 
00:32:15.350 --> 00:32:15.360 align:start position:0%
that's something that could be used to
 
00:32:17.669 --> 00:32:17.679 align:start position:0%
demonstrate a good faith effort if
 
00:32:22.310 --> 00:32:22.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:24.710 --> 00:32:24.720 align:start position:0%
not do things that are commonly
 
00:32:28.310 --> 00:32:28.320 align:start position:0%
recognized as trying to spread to reduce
 
00:32:31.190 --> 00:32:31.200 align:start position:0%
the spread of kova 19 like
 
00:32:33.909 --> 00:32:33.919 align:start position:0%
cleaning surface areas you know
 
00:32:36.789 --> 00:32:36.799 align:start position:0%
requiring employees to to wash their
 
00:32:39.269 --> 00:32:39.279 align:start position:0%
hands after using the restroom just
 
00:32:39.279 --> 00:32:42.630 align:start position:0%
hands after using the restroom just
common

00:32:42.630 --> 00:32:42.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:45.750 --> 00:32:45.760 align:start position:0%
common things that that are in place
 
00:32:45.760 --> 00:32:46.630 align:start position:0%
common things that that are in place
then

00:32:46.630 --> 00:32:46.640 align:start position:0%
then
 
00:32:48.870 --> 00:32:48.880 align:start position:0%
then i think they would be in danger of
 
00:32:51.750 --> 00:32:51.760 align:start position:0%
being found grossly negligent
 
00:32:56.389 --> 00:32:56.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:58.389 --> 00:32:58.399 align:start position:0%
i guess anybody else have anything else
 
00:33:01.269 --> 00:33:01.279 align:start position:0%
i had a question i lost it so
 
00:33:03.110 --> 00:33:03.120 align:start position:0%
well you know where to find me yeah i'll
 
00:33:04.149 --> 00:33:04.159 align:start position:0%
come out and talk to you david if i
 
00:33:06.630 --> 00:33:06.640 align:start position:0%
can't remember if i remember it um any
 
00:33:09.029 --> 00:33:09.039 align:start position:0%
anybody else have a question
 
00:33:10.389 --> 00:33:10.399 align:start position:0%
there being none david thank you very
 
00:33:12.310 --> 00:33:12.320 align:start position:0%
much for your testimony oh actually i
 
00:33:14.070 --> 00:33:14.080 align:start position:0%
remember david is there any place in uh
 
00:33:15.590 --> 00:33:15.600 align:start position:0%
so one of the two areas we're looking at
 
00:33:16.710 --> 00:33:16.720 align:start position:0%
is again
 
00:33:18.470 --> 00:33:18.480 align:start position:0%
where law
 
00:33:18.480 --> 00:33:19.590 align:start position:0%
where law
intersects

00:33:19.590 --> 00:33:19.600 align:start position:0%
intersects
 
00:33:21.750 --> 00:33:21.760 align:start position:0%
in medical intervention with citizenry
 
00:33:23.990 --> 00:33:24.000 align:start position:0%
right with our citizens right and so
 
00:33:26.149 --> 00:33:26.159 align:start position:0%
including immunizations and so the other
 
00:33:27.750 --> 00:33:27.760 align:start position:0%
area we're talking about is regulations
 
00:33:29.990 --> 00:33:30.000 align:start position:0%
right so agency regulations are you
 
00:33:31.110 --> 00:33:31.120 align:start position:0%
aware of any
 
00:33:32.950 --> 00:33:32.960 align:start position:0%
agency regulations that impact your
 
00:33:32.960 --> 00:33:34.070 align:start position:0%
agency regulations that impact your
membership

00:33:34.070 --> 00:33:34.080 align:start position:0%
membership
 
00:33:37.269 --> 00:33:37.279 align:start position:0%
that require either a shall or shall not
 
00:33:39.110 --> 00:33:39.120 align:start position:0%
i know yesterday we heard some testimony
 
00:33:39.120 --> 00:33:40.789 align:start position:0%
i know yesterday we heard some testimony
around

00:33:40.789 --> 00:33:40.799 align:start position:0%
around
 
00:33:42.710 --> 00:33:42.720 align:start position:0%
the federal motor carrier law right so
 
00:33:43.990 --> 00:33:44.000 align:start position:0%
we understand that there's some drug
 
00:33:45.350 --> 00:33:45.360 align:start position:0%
testing and things that have to happen
 
00:33:47.269 --> 00:33:47.279 align:start position:0%
there and we recognize that aspect of
 
00:33:49.509 --> 00:33:49.519 align:start position:0%
agency rules but is there any place else
 
00:33:50.710 --> 00:33:50.720 align:start position:0%
you can think of where there might be
 
00:33:53.110 --> 00:33:53.120 align:start position:0%
some agency rules or some laws that
 
00:33:55.029 --> 00:33:55.039 align:start position:0%
impact and say
 
00:33:57.350 --> 00:33:57.360 align:start position:0%
businesses must do have their employees
 
00:33:59.029 --> 00:33:59.039 align:start position:0%
do this and relative to medical
 
00:34:00.549 --> 00:34:00.559 align:start position:0%
intervention so again like i said in the
 
00:34:01.990 --> 00:34:02.000 align:start position:0%
case of vaccines you're sticking a
 
00:34:03.430 --> 00:34:03.440 align:start position:0%
needle in someone's arm right so you're
 
00:34:04.389 --> 00:34:04.399 align:start position:0%
requiring something in the case of a
 
00:34:06.789 --> 00:34:06.799 align:start position:0%
drug test you're withdrawing and testing
 
00:34:09.190 --> 00:34:09.200 align:start position:0%
a specimen so um
 
00:34:11.109 --> 00:34:11.119 align:start position:0%
so that is there any other place you can
 
00:34:13.030 --> 00:34:13.040 align:start position:0%
think of where in your industry there's
 
00:34:15.909 --> 00:34:15.919 align:start position:0%
laws or agency regulations that come
 
00:34:18.149 --> 00:34:18.159 align:start position:0%
back to have this intervention with with
 
00:34:21.030 --> 00:34:21.040 align:start position:0%
your workers and the citizenry yeah off
 
00:34:23.030 --> 00:34:23.040 align:start position:0%
off the top of my head i don't know that
 
00:34:25.510 --> 00:34:25.520 align:start position:0%
i can respond to that if if you would
 
00:34:27.909 --> 00:34:27.919 align:start position:0%
like i'm happy we have
 
00:34:30.550 --> 00:34:30.560 align:start position:0%
as you can imagine a number of companies
 
00:34:33.750 --> 00:34:33.760 align:start position:0%
with very savvy hr people and attorneys
 
00:34:33.760 --> 00:34:34.550 align:start position:0%
with very savvy hr people and attorneys
who

00:34:34.550 --> 00:34:34.560 align:start position:0%
who
 
00:34:36.470 --> 00:34:36.480 align:start position:0%
are employment law attorneys and i'd be
 
00:34:39.190 --> 00:34:39.200 align:start position:0%
happy to to query them
 
00:34:41.270 --> 00:34:41.280 align:start position:0%
and then respond back to you via email
 
00:34:43.109 --> 00:34:43.119 align:start position:0%
it's just off the top of my head i don't
 
00:34:44.149 --> 00:34:44.159 align:start position:0%
that'd be great because that's exactly
 
00:34:45.990 --> 00:34:46.000 align:start position:0%
what we're looking for is where again in
 
00:34:47.589 --> 00:34:47.599 align:start position:0%
law agency rules we have that
 
00:34:49.589 --> 00:34:49.599 align:start position:0%
intersection and if it's impacting any
 
00:34:50.950 --> 00:34:50.960 align:start position:0%
of your businesses and their workers we
 
00:34:52.550 --> 00:34:52.560 align:start position:0%
appreciate that information i'll i'll do
 
00:34:54.470 --> 00:34:54.480 align:start position:0%
that and i'll follow up via email with
 
00:35:00.870 --> 00:35:00.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:03.030 --> 00:35:03.040 align:start position:0%
who's up next erica next we have curtis
 
00:35:04.710 --> 00:35:04.720 align:start position:0%

berry from the new hampshire retail
association

00:35:07.510 --> 00:35:07.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:08.790 --> 00:35:08.800 align:start position:0%
just because i know curtis raise your
 
00:35:14.150 --> 00:35:14.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:15.589 --> 00:35:15.599 align:start position:0%
good morning again and thank you for the
 
00:35:19.190 --> 00:35:19.200 align:start position:0%
invitation um i'm curtis barry and
 
00:35:20.790 --> 00:35:20.800 align:start position:0%
i represent among others the new
 
00:35:22.950 --> 00:35:22.960 align:start position:0%
hampshire retail association and on
 
00:35:25.910 --> 00:35:25.920 align:start position:0%
their behalf i'm here today
 
00:35:28.069 --> 00:35:28.079 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire retail association as
 
00:35:30.069 --> 00:35:30.079 align:start position:0%
many of you have heard in years before
 
00:35:33.430 --> 00:35:33.440 align:start position:0%
represents retailers from uh very small
 
00:35:35.349 --> 00:35:35.359 align:start position:0%
main street shops to many of the
 
00:35:37.589 --> 00:35:37.599 align:start position:0%
nationally based chains
 
00:35:39.190 --> 00:35:39.200 align:start position:0%
across the country so it's all shapes
 
00:35:41.910 --> 00:35:41.920 align:start position:0%
and sizes of retailers
 
00:35:45.270 --> 00:35:45.280 align:start position:0%
i can start by saying just synopsizing
 
00:35:46.950 --> 00:35:46.960 align:start position:0%
our the position of the new hampshire
 
00:35:48.870 --> 00:35:48.880 align:start position:0%
retail association
 
00:35:51.829 --> 00:35:51.839 align:start position:0%
mirrors uh any is virtually identical to
 
00:35:53.109 --> 00:35:53.119 align:start position:0%
what you just heard from the business
 
00:35:54.550 --> 00:35:54.560 align:start position:0%
and industry association and we
 
00:35:55.750 --> 00:35:55.760 align:start position:0%
testified to that on one of the
 
00:35:57.750 --> 00:35:57.760 align:start position:0%
amendments that had a public hearing in
 
00:35:59.670 --> 00:35:59.680 align:start position:0%
executive departments and administration
 
00:36:01.670 --> 00:36:01.680 align:start position:0%
committee last year
 
00:36:03.430 --> 00:36:03.440 align:start position:0%
business owners
 
00:36:05.990 --> 00:36:06.000 align:start position:0%
managers are responsible for the health
 
00:36:08.069 --> 00:36:08.079 align:start position:0%
and safety of their workplace to cover
 
00:36:11.510 --> 00:36:11.520 align:start position:0%
both employees and their customers and
 
00:36:13.990 --> 00:36:14.000 align:start position:0%
we think it's best to leave them
 
00:36:15.589 --> 00:36:15.599 align:start position:0%
with the decision-making on what's right
 
00:36:17.109 --> 00:36:17.119 align:start position:0%
for that individual business in an
 
00:36:18.790 --> 00:36:18.800 align:start position:0%
individual location
 
00:36:18.800 --> 00:36:19.589 align:start position:0%
individual location
um

00:36:19.589 --> 00:36:19.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:36:21.910 --> 00:36:21.920 align:start position:0%
but the discussion just now i actually i
 
00:36:24.390 --> 00:36:24.400 align:start position:0%
should say also mr chair that the answer
 
00:36:26.470 --> 00:36:26.480 align:start position:0%
to your first two clarifying questions
 
00:36:28.150 --> 00:36:28.160 align:start position:0%
on behalf of the retail association are
 
00:36:29.510 --> 00:36:29.520 align:start position:0%
yes and yes
 
00:36:29.520 --> 00:36:30.390 align:start position:0%
yes and yes
um

00:36:30.390 --> 00:36:30.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:36:32.390 --> 00:36:32.400 align:start position:0%
on the liability end
 
00:36:34.230 --> 00:36:34.240 align:start position:0%
we're aware of some companies that have
 
00:36:36.550 --> 00:36:36.560 align:start position:0%
made the decision to mandate uh among
 
00:36:39.270 --> 00:36:39.280 align:start position:0%
our members they tend to be the larger
 
00:36:42.470 --> 00:36:42.480 align:start position:0%
fortune 500 size companies um
 
00:36:43.910 --> 00:36:43.920 align:start position:0%
from my perspective non-legal
 
00:36:45.510 --> 00:36:45.520 align:start position:0%
perspective i would
 
00:36:45.520 --> 00:36:46.710 align:start position:0%
perspective i would
uh

00:36:46.710 --> 00:36:46.720 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:36:48.950 --> 00:36:48.960 align:start position:0%
think that they rely on their legal
 
00:36:51.270 --> 00:36:51.280 align:start position:0%
resources in-house to make sure that
 
00:36:54.390 --> 00:36:54.400 align:start position:0%
they're covered in in respect to that um
 
00:36:55.910 --> 00:36:55.920 align:start position:0%
but the discussion did touch on the
 
00:36:58.230 --> 00:36:58.240 align:start position:0%
federal mandate uh mr chair and if it's
 
00:36:59.990 --> 00:37:00.000 align:start position:0%
okay with you that's the bulk of my
 
00:37:02.069 --> 00:37:02.079 align:start position:0%
comments okay great
 
00:37:04.950 --> 00:37:04.960 align:start position:0%
um so to set the stage for a year and a
 
00:37:07.109 --> 00:37:07.119 align:start position:0%
half uh like other industries
 
00:37:08.870 --> 00:37:08.880 align:start position:0%
particularly the customer or the public
 
00:37:10.470 --> 00:37:10.480 align:start position:0%
facing industries the retail industry
 
00:37:11.589 --> 00:37:11.599 align:start position:0%
has spent
 
00:37:13.589 --> 00:37:13.599 align:start position:0%
nationwide literally tens of billions of
 
00:37:13.599 --> 00:37:14.950 align:start position:0%
nationwide literally tens of billions of
dollars

00:37:14.950 --> 00:37:14.960 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
00:37:17.109 --> 00:37:17.119 align:start position:0%
in efforts to mitigate the spread of the
 
00:37:17.119 --> 00:37:18.150 align:start position:0%
in efforts to mitigate the spread of the
virus

00:37:18.150 --> 00:37:18.160 align:start position:0%
virus
 
00:37:20.150 --> 00:37:20.160 align:start position:0%
masks for employees
 
00:37:23.270 --> 00:37:23.280 align:start position:0%
plexiglas shields reduced customer
 
00:37:25.510 --> 00:37:25.520 align:start position:0%
traffic through distancing
 
00:37:28.950 --> 00:37:28.960 align:start position:0%
um limitations on the the presence
 
00:37:31.270 --> 00:37:31.280 align:start position:0%
inside the store and things like that
 
00:37:31.280 --> 00:37:32.950 align:start position:0%
inside the store and things like that
um

00:37:32.950 --> 00:37:32.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:37:34.950 --> 00:37:34.960 align:start position:0%
the retail industry
 
00:37:37.349 --> 00:37:37.359 align:start position:0%
itself represented by two major trade
 
00:37:39.589 --> 00:37:39.599 align:start position:0%
associations nationally have spent
 
00:37:41.829 --> 00:37:41.839 align:start position:0%
extensive resources discussing with
 
00:37:43.510 --> 00:37:43.520 align:start position:0%
folks like cdc
 
00:37:46.630 --> 00:37:46.640 align:start position:0%
osha national institutes
 
00:37:48.630 --> 00:37:48.640 align:start position:0%
how to mitigate the spread of the virus
 
00:37:50.630 --> 00:37:50.640 align:start position:0%
and pass it along to members
 
00:37:53.030 --> 00:37:53.040 align:start position:0%
members individually have done the same
 
00:37:53.040 --> 00:37:53.990 align:start position:0%
members individually have done the same
with

00:37:53.990 --> 00:37:54.000 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:37:56.470 --> 00:37:56.480 align:start position:0%
their local health local and state
 
00:37:59.349 --> 00:37:59.359 align:start position:0%
health officials to seek advice
 
00:38:01.990 --> 00:38:02.000 align:start position:0%
um so there are enormous resources in
 
00:38:04.870 --> 00:38:04.880 align:start position:0%
the last 18 months have gone into this
 
00:38:07.349 --> 00:38:07.359 align:start position:0%
we're not aware yet
 
00:38:10.470 --> 00:38:10.480 align:start position:0%
of an explanation of why those efforts
 
00:38:12.790 --> 00:38:12.800 align:start position:0%
have not and are not
 
00:38:12.800 --> 00:38:13.829 align:start position:0%
have not and are not
enough

00:38:13.829 --> 00:38:13.839 align:start position:0%
enough
 
00:38:15.589 --> 00:38:15.599 align:start position:0%
to stop the spread of the virus and why
 
00:38:21.829 --> 00:38:21.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:24.550 --> 00:38:24.560 align:start position:0%
the the current regulations from
 
00:38:26.230 --> 00:38:26.240 align:start position:0%
uh osha
 
00:38:29.349 --> 00:38:29.359 align:start position:0%
uh have some specifications you know how
 
00:38:31.670 --> 00:38:31.680 align:start position:0%
to develop rules
 
00:38:34.310 --> 00:38:34.320 align:start position:0%
you they use the word necessary
 
00:38:36.870 --> 00:38:36.880 align:start position:0%
they use the term grave danger in order
 
00:38:36.880 --> 00:38:37.750 align:start position:0%
they use the term grave danger in order
to

00:38:37.750 --> 00:38:37.760 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:38:40.790 --> 00:38:40.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:44.390 --> 00:38:44.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:46.710 --> 00:38:46.720 align:start position:0%
get back to my page here sorry
 
00:38:46.720 --> 00:38:48.870 align:start position:0%
get back to my page here sorry
um

00:38:48.870 --> 00:38:48.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:38:51.990 --> 00:38:52.000 align:start position:0%
and it's unclear why
 
00:38:55.109 --> 00:38:55.119 align:start position:0%
those two uh qualifications fit the
 
00:38:57.190 --> 00:38:57.200 align:start position:0%
current situation for example on the day
 
00:38:58.630 --> 00:38:58.640 align:start position:0%
that the president announced the current
 
00:39:01.589 --> 00:39:01.599 align:start position:0%
mandate that seven day average of new
 
00:39:05.349 --> 00:39:05.359 align:start position:0%
cases was over 147 000 nationwide per
 
00:39:05.359 --> 00:39:06.390 align:start position:0%
cases was over 147 000 nationwide per
day

00:39:06.390 --> 00:39:06.400 align:start position:0%
day
 
00:39:08.310 --> 00:39:08.320 align:start position:0%
as of october 1st
 
00:39:11.190 --> 00:39:11.200 align:start position:0%
that average had dropped to 90 000 per
 
00:39:11.200 --> 00:39:12.069 align:start position:0%
that average had dropped to 90 000 per
day

00:39:12.069 --> 00:39:12.079 align:start position:0%
day
 
00:39:14.069 --> 00:39:14.079 align:start position:0%
and as of yesterday the seven day moving
 
00:39:15.510 --> 00:39:15.520 align:start position:0%
average was
 
00:39:19.109 --> 00:39:19.119 align:start position:0%
uh under 65 000 new cases per day it's a
 
00:39:21.670 --> 00:39:21.680 align:start position:0%
decline of 55 percent since the
 
00:39:24.870 --> 00:39:24.880 align:start position:0%
president announced the the requirement
 
00:39:27.510 --> 00:39:27.520 align:start position:0%
we haven't heard an explanation yet
 
00:39:29.430 --> 00:39:29.440 align:start position:0%
why the mandate is still at this point
 
00:39:29.440 --> 00:39:32.230 align:start position:0%
why the mandate is still at this point
necessary

00:39:32.230 --> 00:39:32.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:34.230 --> 00:39:34.240 align:start position:0%
as mentioned in the previous discussion
 
00:39:35.910 --> 00:39:35.920 align:start position:0%
retailers like every other business is
 
00:39:38.390 --> 00:39:38.400 align:start position:0%
struggling for employees
 
00:39:40.390 --> 00:39:40.400 align:start position:0%
employees that are working
 
00:39:40.400 --> 00:39:41.349 align:start position:0%
employees that are working
are

00:39:41.349 --> 00:39:41.359 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:39:43.430 --> 00:39:43.440 align:start position:0%
stretched in many cases
 
00:39:45.030 --> 00:39:45.040 align:start position:0%
they're stretched
 
00:39:46.870 --> 00:39:46.880 align:start position:0%
they're resentful
 
00:39:48.470 --> 00:39:48.480 align:start position:0%
and yet the mandate doesn't seem to
 
00:39:50.310 --> 00:39:50.320 align:start position:0%
consider the impact on employee
 
00:39:50.320 --> 00:39:51.829 align:start position:0%
consider the impact on employee
retention

00:39:51.829 --> 00:39:51.839 align:start position:0%
retention
 
00:39:53.430 --> 00:39:53.440 align:start position:0%
and recruitment
 
00:39:55.430 --> 00:39:55.440 align:start position:0%
as i mentioned some members have taken
 
00:39:56.950 --> 00:39:56.960 align:start position:0%
it upon themselves to implement a
 
00:39:59.430 --> 00:39:59.440 align:start position:0%
mandate on their own
 
00:40:01.829 --> 00:40:01.839 align:start position:0%
but they feel that that is in the best
 
00:40:03.109 --> 00:40:03.119 align:start position:0%
interest of their business and they've
 
00:40:04.790 --> 00:40:04.800 align:start position:0%
made it after an assessment of their
 
00:40:08.309 --> 00:40:08.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:11.190 --> 00:40:11.200 align:start position:0%
next is
 
00:40:11.200 --> 00:40:13.270 align:start position:0%
next is
um

00:40:13.270 --> 00:40:13.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:40:15.270 --> 00:40:15.280 align:start position:0%
uh mixed messaging i think what we've
 
00:40:16.790 --> 00:40:16.800 align:start position:0%
heard most from
 
00:40:18.230 --> 00:40:18.240 align:start position:0%
from our members
 
00:40:21.109 --> 00:40:21.119 align:start position:0%
um it started in may the cdc released
 
00:40:23.349 --> 00:40:23.359 align:start position:0%
released guidance um saying that fully
 
00:40:25.109 --> 00:40:25.119 align:start position:0%
this is a quote fully vaccinated people
 
00:40:27.589 --> 00:40:27.599 align:start position:0%
no longer need need to wear a mask or
 
00:40:30.150 --> 00:40:30.160 align:start position:0%
physically distance in any setting
 
00:40:32.710 --> 00:40:32.720 align:start position:0%
on june 10th osha then issued what it
 
00:40:35.109 --> 00:40:35.119 align:start position:0%
called a tailored standard aimed at the
 
00:40:38.790 --> 00:40:38.800 align:start position:0%
workers uh of in most danger
 
00:40:41.510 --> 00:40:41.520 align:start position:0%
but what we've heard is this new mandate
 
00:40:43.270 --> 00:40:43.280 align:start position:0%
adds even more contradiction to the
 
00:40:45.750 --> 00:40:45.760 align:start position:0%
mixed messaging that we've already heard
 
00:40:45.760 --> 00:40:46.870 align:start position:0%
mixed messaging that we've already heard
um

00:40:46.870 --> 00:40:46.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:40:49.109 --> 00:40:49.119 align:start position:0%
another inconsistency mr gervais already
 
00:40:53.109 --> 00:40:53.119 align:start position:0%
mentioned we're puzzled by employees of
 
00:40:55.030 --> 00:40:55.040 align:start position:0%
a hundred or more employees
 
00:40:57.589 --> 00:40:57.599 align:start position:0%
in that setting are in grave danger
 
00:41:00.150 --> 00:41:00.160 align:start position:0%
again according to the osha standards
 
00:41:01.670 --> 00:41:01.680 align:start position:0%
and employees
 
00:41:03.990 --> 00:41:04.000 align:start position:0%
of businesses that employ 99 or fewer
 
00:41:09.349 --> 00:41:09.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:11.589 --> 00:41:11.599 align:start position:0%
we're faced with a lot of lack of
 
00:41:13.829 --> 00:41:13.839 align:start position:0%
guidance i guess you would say
 
00:41:16.309 --> 00:41:16.319 align:start position:0%
as at this point
 
00:41:17.670 --> 00:41:17.680 align:start position:0%
retailers don't know how to
 
00:41:20.550 --> 00:41:20.560 align:start position:0%
differentiate yet between vaccinated and
 
00:41:20.560 --> 00:41:22.870 align:start position:0%
differentiate yet between vaccinated and
unvaccinated

00:41:22.870 --> 00:41:22.880 align:start position:0%
unvaccinated
 
00:41:26.550 --> 00:41:26.560 align:start position:0%
we also need to keep in mind that
 
00:41:29.190 --> 00:41:29.200 align:start position:0%
we are uncertain how other federal
 
00:41:32.069 --> 00:41:32.079 align:start position:0%
regulations and statutes apply
 
00:41:32.079 --> 00:41:33.670 align:start position:0%
regulations and statutes apply
hipaa

00:41:33.670 --> 00:41:33.680 align:start position:0%
hipaa
 
00:41:36.390 --> 00:41:36.400 align:start position:0%
ada uh chief among those and there are
 
00:41:36.400 --> 00:41:37.430 align:start position:0%
ada uh chief among those and there are
others

00:41:37.430 --> 00:41:37.440 align:start position:0%
others
 
00:41:40.069 --> 00:41:40.079 align:start position:0%
um we don't know how and where to
 
00:41:43.270 --> 00:41:43.280 align:start position:0%
document the vaccine status of employees
 
00:41:45.910 --> 00:41:45.920 align:start position:0%
we don't know how to process requests
 
00:41:48.390 --> 00:41:48.400 align:start position:0%
for exemptions
 
00:41:50.870 --> 00:41:50.880 align:start position:0%
the president stated that workers would
 
00:41:52.790 --> 00:41:52.800 align:start position:0%
need the unvaccinated workers would need
 
00:41:55.030 --> 00:41:55.040 align:start position:0%
to show a negative test at least once a
 
00:41:55.040 --> 00:41:56.870 align:start position:0%
to show a negative test at least once a
week

00:41:56.870 --> 00:41:56.880 align:start position:0%
week
 
00:41:59.109 --> 00:41:59.119 align:start position:0%
i did some real quick
 
00:42:00.550 --> 00:42:00.560 align:start position:0%
back of the envelope i guess you would
 
00:42:02.470 --> 00:42:02.480 align:start position:0%
call it
 
00:42:02.480 --> 00:42:03.670 align:start position:0%
call it
analysis

00:42:03.670 --> 00:42:03.680 align:start position:0%
analysis
 
00:42:05.430 --> 00:42:05.440 align:start position:0%
i could be wrong but
 
00:42:09.109 --> 00:42:09.119 align:start position:0%
this could impose a mandate of a hundred
 
00:42:10.390 --> 00:42:10.400 align:start position:0%
thousand tests in the state of new
 
00:42:12.390 --> 00:42:12.400 align:start position:0%
hampshire among all employees
 
00:42:13.430 --> 00:42:13.440 align:start position:0%
per week
 
00:42:16.309 --> 00:42:16.319 align:start position:0%
and we're not sure who covers the cost
 
00:42:18.309 --> 00:42:18.319 align:start position:0%
it's an unfunded mandate obviously if
 
00:42:21.750 --> 00:42:21.760 align:start position:0%
the government's not covering the cost
 
00:42:23.190 --> 00:42:23.200 align:start position:0%
if the government's going to mandate
 
00:42:23.200 --> 00:42:24.069 align:start position:0%
if the government's going to mandate
this

00:42:24.069 --> 00:42:24.079 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:42:25.910 --> 00:42:25.920 align:start position:0%
are we allowed to pass that cost on to
 
00:42:29.030 --> 00:42:29.040 align:start position:0%
employees we're not sure
 
00:42:29.040 --> 00:42:32.150 align:start position:0%
employees we're not sure
um

00:42:32.150 --> 00:42:32.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:34.069 --> 00:42:34.079 align:start position:0%
i think um
 
00:42:36.150 --> 00:42:36.160 align:start position:0%
one last point to sum up and then i got
 
00:42:38.870 --> 00:42:38.880 align:start position:0%
we have one other area i'd like to cover
 
00:42:38.880 --> 00:42:39.750 align:start position:0%
we have one other area i'd like to cover
um

00:42:39.750 --> 00:42:39.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:42:44.069 --> 00:42:44.079 align:start position:0%
we're very wary and would extend a word
 
00:42:47.510 --> 00:42:47.520 align:start position:0%
of caution to make sure that mandates or
 
00:42:47.520 --> 00:42:49.270 align:start position:0%
of caution to make sure that mandates or
prohibitions

00:42:49.270 --> 00:42:49.280 align:start position:0%
prohibitions
 
00:42:52.230 --> 00:42:52.240 align:start position:0%
at the state level do not conflict with
 
00:42:54.150 --> 00:42:54.160 align:start position:0%
what's imposed at the federal level that
 
00:42:55.990 --> 00:42:56.000 align:start position:0%
imposes a great deal of difficulty in
 
00:42:59.270 --> 00:42:59.280 align:start position:0%
all businesses i'm sure
 
00:43:01.030 --> 00:43:01.040 align:start position:0%
the second area i'd like to cover very
 
00:43:02.790 --> 00:43:02.800 align:start position:0%
briefly mr chair is
 
00:43:05.750 --> 00:43:05.760 align:start position:0%
uh the mask mandates that we saw
 
00:43:07.510 --> 00:43:07.520 align:start position:0%
in the past
 
00:43:09.990 --> 00:43:10.000 align:start position:0%
and this is something we had both as an
 
00:43:13.270 --> 00:43:13.280 align:start position:0%
association and individual members had
 
00:43:14.630 --> 00:43:14.640 align:start position:0%
extensive discussions with law
 
00:43:17.109 --> 00:43:17.119 align:start position:0%
enforcement both at the state level and
 
00:43:19.589 --> 00:43:19.599 align:start position:0%
in individual municipalities here in new
 
00:43:19.599 --> 00:43:21.270 align:start position:0%
in individual municipalities here in new
hampshire

00:43:21.270 --> 00:43:21.280 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
00:43:23.270 --> 00:43:23.280 align:start position:0%
which is the requirement that customers
 
00:43:25.589 --> 00:43:25.599 align:start position:0%
entering a retail location
 
00:43:27.030 --> 00:43:27.040 align:start position:0%
wear a mask
 
00:43:28.630 --> 00:43:28.640 align:start position:0%
all of those officials
 
00:43:31.030 --> 00:43:31.040 align:start position:0%
i'm happy to say understood our position
 
00:43:33.430 --> 00:43:33.440 align:start position:0%
and agreed um
 
00:43:36.069 --> 00:43:36.079 align:start position:0%
but what our request was at the time and
 
00:43:38.390 --> 00:43:38.400 align:start position:0%
i use this as an example for for other
 
00:43:38.400 --> 00:43:39.829 align:start position:0%
i use this as an example for for other
mandates

00:43:39.829 --> 00:43:39.839 align:start position:0%
mandates
 
00:43:41.750 --> 00:43:41.760 align:start position:0%
the request was at the time that any
 
00:43:44.150 --> 00:43:44.160 align:start position:0%
mandate should not require enforcement
 
00:43:46.230 --> 00:43:46.240 align:start position:0%
by the retail employee
 
00:43:49.109 --> 00:43:49.119 align:start position:0%
retail employees like law enforcement
 
00:43:51.910 --> 00:43:51.920 align:start position:0%
are are not trained in
 
00:43:53.750 --> 00:43:53.760 align:start position:0%
detention are not trained in conflict
 
00:43:55.270 --> 00:43:55.280 align:start position:0%
resolution or any of the other things
 
00:43:55.280 --> 00:43:56.069 align:start position:0%
resolution or any of the other things
that

00:43:56.069 --> 00:43:56.079 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:43:58.230 --> 00:43:58.240 align:start position:0%
local police or other law enforcement
 
00:43:58.240 --> 00:43:59.109 align:start position:0%
local police or other law enforcement
are

00:43:59.109 --> 00:43:59.119 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:44:02.230 --> 00:44:02.240 align:start position:0%
and to require uh retail employees to
 
00:44:05.430 --> 00:44:05.440 align:start position:0%
enforce those type of mandates is unfair
 
00:44:08.309 --> 00:44:08.319 align:start position:0%
to both the the store and that employee
 
00:44:10.309 --> 00:44:10.319 align:start position:0%
putting them in that in that situation
 
00:44:12.870 --> 00:44:12.880 align:start position:0%
again thankfully um everyone agreed we
 
00:44:14.470 --> 00:44:14.480 align:start position:0%
had great conversations in fact there
 
00:44:15.349 --> 00:44:15.359 align:start position:0%
was a
 
00:44:18.950 --> 00:44:18.960 align:start position:0%
um after the the state's mandate a
 
00:44:20.950 --> 00:44:20.960 align:start position:0%
opinion or a document that came out from
 
00:44:22.950 --> 00:44:22.960 align:start position:0%
the attorney general's office that in
 
00:44:25.109 --> 00:44:25.119 align:start position:0%
essence said as much so we were thankful
 
00:44:27.109 --> 00:44:27.119 align:start position:0%
for that um i'm happy to answer
 
00:44:29.829 --> 00:44:29.839 align:start position:0%
questions to the best of my ability
 
00:44:32.309 --> 00:44:32.319 align:start position:0%
great thank you so i just in just the
 
00:44:33.910 --> 00:44:33.920 align:start position:0%
issue of transparency curtis and i
 
00:44:35.510 --> 00:44:35.520 align:start position:0%
served on the governor's reopening task
 
00:44:37.910 --> 00:44:37.920 align:start position:0%
force together and we wrote most of the
 
00:44:37.920 --> 00:44:39.109 align:start position:0%
force together and we wrote most of the
guidance

00:44:39.109 --> 00:44:39.119 align:start position:0%
guidance
 
00:44:41.349 --> 00:44:41.359 align:start position:0%
for the retail industry and opening in
 
00:44:44.150 --> 00:44:44.160 align:start position:0%
plexiglasses and masking and distancing
 
00:44:46.470 --> 00:44:46.480 align:start position:0%
and how much material could be on the
 
00:44:47.829 --> 00:44:47.839 align:start position:0%
shelf for how long and that kind of
 
00:44:49.670 --> 00:44:49.680 align:start position:0%
stuff so just so everyone's aware that
 
00:44:51.430 --> 00:44:51.440 align:start position:0%
kirsten i did serve on that committee
 
00:44:53.349 --> 00:44:53.359 align:start position:0%
together and worked through this during
 
00:44:55.829 --> 00:44:55.839 align:start position:0%
the early phases of this pandemic
 
00:44:59.670 --> 00:44:59.680 align:start position:0%
um questions anybody from the committee
 
00:45:00.950 --> 00:45:00.960 align:start position:0%
so curtis i'm going to ask you the same
 
00:45:02.309 --> 00:45:02.319 align:start position:0%
kind of questions i think you answered
 
00:45:03.510 --> 00:45:03.520 align:start position:0%
them with a yes and yes but i want to
 
00:45:05.670 --> 00:45:05.680 align:start position:0%
make sure i'm clear
 
00:45:07.349 --> 00:45:07.359 align:start position:0%
so again we talk about things like
 
00:45:09.349 --> 00:45:09.359 align:start position:0%
religious exemptions for mandates right
 
00:45:09.359 --> 00:45:10.150 align:start position:0%
religious exemptions for mandates right
so

00:45:10.150 --> 00:45:10.160 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:45:12.069 --> 00:45:12.079 align:start position:0%
you would prefer the
 
00:45:14.069 --> 00:45:14.079 align:start position:0%
st legislature not
 
00:45:16.150 --> 00:45:16.160 align:start position:0%
let's at least help clarify that issue
 
00:45:18.150 --> 00:45:18.160 align:start position:0%
and that we don't want businesses making
 
00:45:20.550 --> 00:45:20.560 align:start position:0%
determinations whether or not a person
 
00:45:23.349 --> 00:45:23.359 align:start position:0%
is religious enough to be entitled to uh
 
00:45:25.030 --> 00:45:25.040 align:start position:0%
um we don't want the businesses to have
 
00:45:27.109 --> 00:45:27.119 align:start position:0%
to go into that model of determining if
 
00:45:29.670 --> 00:45:29.680 align:start position:0%
they're religious enough to to warrant
 
00:45:32.630 --> 00:45:32.640 align:start position:0%
and and be entitled to a a religious
 
00:45:34.630 --> 00:45:34.640 align:start position:0%
exemption now it's my turn to ask a
 
00:45:36.630 --> 00:45:36.640 align:start position:0%
clarifying question are you speaking in
 
00:45:38.950 --> 00:45:38.960 align:start position:0%
terms of the case where there's a state
 
00:45:38.960 --> 00:45:39.990 align:start position:0%
terms of the case where there's a state
mandate

00:45:39.990 --> 00:45:40.000 align:start position:0%
mandate
 
00:45:41.589 --> 00:45:41.599 align:start position:0%
so i'm speaking again so in certain
 
00:45:43.109 --> 00:45:43.119 align:start position:0%
instances we have you have the osha rule
 
00:45:44.230 --> 00:45:44.240 align:start position:0%
coming down so you have some of your
 
00:45:45.910 --> 00:45:45.920 align:start position:0%
businesses may be subject to that osha
 
00:45:45.920 --> 00:45:46.710 align:start position:0%
businesses may be subject to that osha
rule

00:45:46.710 --> 00:45:46.720 align:start position:0%
rule
 
00:45:47.990 --> 00:45:48.000 align:start position:0%
you're going to have other instances we
 
00:45:49.750 --> 00:45:49.760 align:start position:0%
have smaller
 
00:45:51.030 --> 00:45:51.040 align:start position:0%
businesses that may be federal
 
00:45:52.550 --> 00:45:52.560 align:start position:0%
contractors that'll be subject to the
 
00:45:54.470 --> 00:45:54.480 align:start position:0%
executive order so
 
00:45:56.710 --> 00:45:56.720 align:start position:0%
again relative to those businesses that
 
00:45:58.630 --> 00:45:58.640 align:start position:0%
do have to now force a mandate coming
 
00:45:59.990 --> 00:46:00.000 align:start position:0%
down from the federal government whether
 
00:46:01.829 --> 00:46:01.839 align:start position:0%
the business wants it or not the
 
00:46:03.510 --> 00:46:03.520 align:start position:0%
business is kind of stuck in this now
 
00:46:05.270 --> 00:46:05.280 align:start position:0%
decision of of how do i deal with my
 
00:46:07.270 --> 00:46:07.280 align:start position:0%
employees in a time when trying to find
 
00:46:10.710 --> 00:46:10.720 align:start position:0%
an employee is next to impossible um and
 
00:46:12.470 --> 00:46:12.480 align:start position:0%
and keep keep my workforce at the same
 
00:46:14.710 --> 00:46:14.720 align:start position:0%
time be responsive to my employees so
 
00:46:16.230 --> 00:46:16.240 align:start position:0%
questions on the religious exemption
 
00:46:19.589 --> 00:46:19.599 align:start position:0%
side um would it be helpful to the to
 
00:46:22.150 --> 00:46:22.160 align:start position:0%
the businesses to have some sort of
 
00:46:23.829 --> 00:46:23.839 align:start position:0%
clarification on that from the state so
 
00:46:25.829 --> 00:46:25.839 align:start position:0%
that you know you're not stuck in this
 
00:46:29.430 --> 00:46:29.440 align:start position:0%
civil rights liability hole
 
00:46:29.440 --> 00:46:30.309 align:start position:0%
civil rights liability hole
um

00:46:30.309 --> 00:46:30.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:46:32.390 --> 00:46:32.400 align:start position:0%
the religious exemption specifically is
 
00:46:34.470 --> 00:46:34.480 align:start position:0%
not something that's come up in our
 
00:46:35.990 --> 00:46:36.000 align:start position:0%
outreach to members
 
00:46:37.589 --> 00:46:37.599 align:start position:0%
you know after the invitation or
 
00:46:40.390 --> 00:46:40.400 align:start position:0%
otherwise um but generally my sense
 
00:46:43.670 --> 00:46:43.680 align:start position:0%
would be yes because as i mentioned on
 
00:46:45.430 --> 00:46:45.440 align:start position:0%
several other pieces there's a lack of
 
00:46:47.190 --> 00:46:47.200 align:start position:0%
clarity how do we record it how do we
 
00:46:49.190 --> 00:46:49.200 align:start position:0%
verify it that sort of thing i guess i
 
00:46:52.870 --> 00:46:52.880 align:start position:0%
would question how the state
 
00:46:55.270 --> 00:46:55.280 align:start position:0%
could help clarify a federal
 
00:46:57.510 --> 00:46:57.520 align:start position:0%
regulation that that part of marshall
 
00:46:57.520 --> 00:46:58.630 align:start position:0%
regulation that that part of marshall
okay

00:46:58.630 --> 00:46:58.640 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:46:58.640 --> 00:47:00.630 align:start position:0%
okay
um

00:47:00.630 --> 00:47:00.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:47:02.870 --> 00:47:02.880 align:start position:0%
and then the same issue
 
00:47:05.589 --> 00:47:05.599 align:start position:0%
so you in your workforce on on these
 
00:47:08.390 --> 00:47:08.400 align:start position:0%
mandates coming down is it do you have
 
00:47:10.550 --> 00:47:10.560 align:start position:0%
the same we heard from dave from the bia
 
00:47:12.550 --> 00:47:12.560 align:start position:0%
that you know some employees have staged
 
00:47:14.950 --> 00:47:14.960 align:start position:0%
a day off work off work walk off because
 
00:47:17.109 --> 00:47:17.119 align:start position:0%
they don't want to have the mandates and
 
00:47:18.550 --> 00:47:18.560 align:start position:0%
it impacts that have you seen that in
 
00:47:21.349 --> 00:47:21.359 align:start position:0%
your industry as well no um to my
 
00:47:23.910 --> 00:47:23.920 align:start position:0%
knowledge by and large employers haven't
 
00:47:25.670 --> 00:47:25.680 align:start position:0%
at least our members haven't imposed
 
00:47:25.680 --> 00:47:27.030 align:start position:0%
at least our members haven't imposed
mandates

00:47:27.030 --> 00:47:27.040 align:start position:0%
mandates
 
00:47:29.750 --> 00:47:29.760 align:start position:0%
those that have uh have reported that
 
00:47:31.910 --> 00:47:31.920 align:start position:0%
they haven't had pushback or any
 
00:47:31.920 --> 00:47:32.950 align:start position:0%
they haven't had pushback or any
problems

00:47:32.950 --> 00:47:32.960 align:start position:0%
problems
 
00:47:34.630 --> 00:47:34.640 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
00:47:36.630 --> 00:47:36.640 align:start position:0%
anything else
 
00:47:38.390 --> 00:47:38.400 align:start position:0%
not hearing any
 
00:47:42.150 --> 00:47:42.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:43.589 --> 00:47:43.599 align:start position:0%
anybody else on the business side are we
 
00:47:48.069 --> 00:47:48.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:49.430 --> 00:47:49.440 align:start position:0%
so is there anybody else in the business
 
00:47:51.109 --> 00:47:51.119 align:start position:0%
industry that wanted to speak and didn't
 
00:47:52.390 --> 00:47:52.400 align:start position:0%
put in a pink card we're going to
 
00:47:53.510 --> 00:47:53.520 align:start position:0%
otherwise we're going to move over to
 
00:47:55.109 --> 00:47:55.119 align:start position:0%

00:47:57.109 --> 00:47:57.119 align:start position:0%

i'm here representing all 26 of our
 
00:48:52.309 --> 00:48:52.319 align:start position:0%
state's community hospitals as well as
 
00:48:54.790 --> 00:48:54.800 align:start position:0%
all of our specialty hospitals
 
00:48:56.470 --> 00:48:56.480 align:start position:0%
hospitals and their healthcare heroes
 
00:48:57.670 --> 00:48:57.680 align:start position:0%
have been on the front lines of the
 
00:49:01.349 --> 00:49:01.359 align:start position:0%
pandemic for the past year and a half
 
00:49:03.030 --> 00:49:03.040 align:start position:0%
and they are as stressed and challenged
 
00:49:04.710 --> 00:49:04.720 align:start position:0%
today as they have been at any point
 
00:49:06.549 --> 00:49:06.559 align:start position:0%
during the pandemic
 
00:49:08.069 --> 00:49:08.079 align:start position:0%
you know during those first early days
 
00:49:09.990 --> 00:49:10.000 align:start position:0%
of the pandemic we all watched with
 
00:49:12.470 --> 00:49:12.480 align:start position:0%
horror as we saw hospitals overseas
 
00:49:14.309 --> 00:49:14.319 align:start position:0%
literally being overwhelmed
 
00:49:17.670 --> 00:49:17.680 align:start position:0%
with covet 19 patients and you know
 
00:49:19.430 --> 00:49:19.440 align:start position:0%
one of the overriding goals has always
 
00:49:21.670 --> 00:49:21.680 align:start position:0%
been to ensure that we had the hospital
 
00:49:24.390 --> 00:49:24.400 align:start position:0%
bed capacity to care for those patients
 
00:49:26.790 --> 00:49:26.800 align:start position:0%
you know the response was swift
 
00:49:28.549 --> 00:49:28.559 align:start position:0%
in addition to lockdown stay at home
 
00:49:30.150 --> 00:49:30.160 align:start position:0%
orders and more hospitals across the
 
00:49:31.750 --> 00:49:31.760 align:start position:0%
country and here in new hampshire
 
00:49:33.750 --> 00:49:33.760 align:start position:0%
canceled all non-urgent elective
 
00:49:35.750 --> 00:49:35.760 align:start position:0%
procedures to preserve the personal
 
00:49:37.430 --> 00:49:37.440 align:start position:0%
protective equipment which was in short
 
00:49:39.829 --> 00:49:39.839 align:start position:0%
supply at the time and bed capacity to
 
00:49:41.670 --> 00:49:41.680 align:start position:0%
ensure they could serve patients with
 
00:49:43.829 --> 00:49:43.839 align:start position:0%
covet 19 and in addition much of the
 
00:49:46.069 --> 00:49:46.079 align:start position:0%
health care system outside of hospitals
 
00:49:47.829 --> 00:49:47.839 align:start position:0%
moved to virtual models of care to keep
 
00:49:50.470 --> 00:49:50.480 align:start position:0%
people safe and socially distant
 
00:49:52.950 --> 00:49:52.960 align:start position:0%
i could not be prouder of our hospitals
 
00:49:54.870 --> 00:49:54.880 align:start position:0%
and the teams of dedicated doctors
 
00:49:57.109 --> 00:49:57.119 align:start position:0%
nurses other clinicians environmental
 
00:49:59.349 --> 00:49:59.359 align:start position:0%
food services and all the other staff
 
00:50:01.510 --> 00:50:01.520 align:start position:0%
who worked tirelessly over the past 18
 
00:50:03.589 --> 00:50:03.599 align:start position:0%
plus months to ensure that every patient
 
00:50:05.270 --> 00:50:05.280 align:start position:0%
could get the high quality care that
 
00:50:06.870 --> 00:50:06.880 align:start position:0%
they need
 
00:50:08.870 --> 00:50:08.880 align:start position:0%
in december of last year new hampshire
 
00:50:10.150 --> 00:50:10.160 align:start position:0%
like the rest of the country was
 
00:50:11.990 --> 00:50:12.000 align:start position:0%
experiencing one of the worst surges of
 
00:50:13.270 --> 00:50:13.280 align:start position:0%
the pandemic
 
00:50:15.670 --> 00:50:15.680 align:start position:0%
it was then that several several nurses
 
00:50:17.670 --> 00:50:17.680 align:start position:0%
from the elliott hospital in manchester
 
00:50:19.270 --> 00:50:19.280 align:start position:0%
were among the first caregivers in the
 
00:50:22.230 --> 00:50:22.240 align:start position:0%
state to receive the covet 19 vaccine
 
00:50:24.790 --> 00:50:24.800 align:start position:0%
that day was one of the brightest spots
 
00:50:27.030 --> 00:50:27.040 align:start position:0%
in what had been a very long and dark
 
00:50:29.589 --> 00:50:29.599 align:start position:0%
period of the pandemic as it brought
 
00:50:31.670 --> 00:50:31.680 align:start position:0%
hope that we finally had a safe and
 
00:50:33.910 --> 00:50:33.920 align:start position:0%
effective tool to combat the virus and
 
00:50:36.230 --> 00:50:36.240 align:start position:0%
eventually return to normal what we all
 
00:50:38.230 --> 00:50:38.240 align:start position:0%
want getting back to work to school
 
00:50:39.829 --> 00:50:39.839 align:start position:0%
traveling visiting with friends going
 
00:50:42.150 --> 00:50:42.160 align:start position:0%
out to a movie and so much more
 
00:50:43.829 --> 00:50:43.839 align:start position:0%
as vaccination rates increased in new
 
00:50:45.510 --> 00:50:45.520 align:start position:0%
hampshire we witnessed an expected and
 
00:50:47.589 --> 00:50:47.599 align:start position:0%
welcome reduction in the number of new
 
00:50:50.230 --> 00:50:50.240 align:start position:0%
cases hospitalizations and deaths
 
00:50:51.829 --> 00:50:51.839 align:start position:0%
on january 1st of this year new
 
00:50:54.150 --> 00:50:54.160 align:start position:0%
hampshire hospitals hit their highest
 
00:50:57.510 --> 00:50:57.520 align:start position:0%
peak of coven 19 hospitalizations of 334
 
00:50:57.520 --> 00:50:58.549 align:start position:0%
peak of coven 19 hospitalizations of 334
patients

00:50:58.549 --> 00:50:58.559 align:start position:0%
patients
 
00:51:00.710 --> 00:51:00.720 align:start position:0%
on july 1st that number had dropped to
 
00:51:03.270 --> 00:51:03.280 align:start position:0%
just 17 patients
 
00:51:05.109 --> 00:51:05.119 align:start position:0%
unfortunately as the more contagious
 
00:51:06.710 --> 00:51:06.720 align:start position:0%
delta variant has taken root in new
 
00:51:10.150 --> 00:51:10.160 align:start position:0%
hampshire that number was 190 on monday
 
00:51:12.390 --> 00:51:12.400 align:start position:0%
of this week november 1st
 
00:51:14.150 --> 00:51:14.160 align:start position:0%
the vast majority of those patients that
 
00:51:15.750 --> 00:51:15.760 align:start position:0%
are hospitalized are unfortunately
 
00:51:18.309 --> 00:51:18.319 align:start position:0%
unvaccinated while we are seeing more
 
00:51:19.750 --> 00:51:19.760 align:start position:0%
breakthrough cases in new hampshire
 
00:51:21.750 --> 00:51:21.760 align:start position:0%
across the country we know that the most
 
00:51:23.190 --> 00:51:23.200 align:start position:0%
effective means of preventing
 
00:51:25.589 --> 00:51:25.599 align:start position:0%
hospitalizations of coba 19 patients is
 
00:51:27.510 --> 00:51:27.520 align:start position:0%
to receive one of the vaccines approved
 
00:51:29.670 --> 00:51:29.680 align:start position:0%
for use in the u.s
 
00:51:31.190 --> 00:51:31.200 align:start position:0%
in august the new hampshire hospital
 
00:51:33.190 --> 00:51:33.200 align:start position:0%
association and its member hospitals
 
00:51:34.790 --> 00:51:34.800 align:start position:0%
announced a consensus statement in
 
00:51:36.390 --> 00:51:36.400 align:start position:0%
support of requiring our healthcare
 
00:51:38.549 --> 00:51:38.559 align:start position:0%
workforce to be vaccinated against cova
 
00:51:41.030 --> 00:51:41.040 align:start position:0%
19 in order to protect the health and
 
00:51:43.670 --> 00:51:43.680 align:start position:0%
safety of our patients our staff and the
 
00:51:43.680 --> 00:51:45.030 align:start position:0%
safety of our patients our staff and the
community

00:51:45.030 --> 00:51:45.040 align:start position:0%
community
 
00:51:46.470 --> 00:51:46.480 align:start position:0%
hospitals would announce and develop
 
00:51:47.990 --> 00:51:48.000 align:start position:0%
their individual policies over the
 
00:51:49.589 --> 00:51:49.599 align:start position:0%
ensuing weeks and months and
 
00:51:50.870 --> 00:51:50.880 align:start position:0%
implementing those requirements
 
00:51:52.870 --> 00:51:52.880 align:start position:0%
hospitals engaged in robust education
 
00:51:54.309 --> 00:51:54.319 align:start position:0%
with their staff about the benefits of
 
00:51:56.069 --> 00:51:56.079 align:start position:0%
the vaccine and would comply with all
 
00:51:57.349 --> 00:51:57.359 align:start position:0%
relevant and state federal and
 
00:51:59.109 --> 00:51:59.119 align:start position:0%
guidelines including offering medical
 
00:52:01.510 --> 00:52:01.520 align:start position:0%
and religious exemptions
 
00:52:03.109 --> 00:52:03.119 align:start position:0%
hospitals have an inherent
 
00:52:05.430 --> 00:52:05.440 align:start position:0%
responsibility to protect the health and
 
00:52:07.270 --> 00:52:07.280 align:start position:0%
safety of their patients who by their
 
00:52:09.750 --> 00:52:09.760 align:start position:0%
very nature are very ill and cope and
 
00:52:12.069 --> 00:52:12.079 align:start position:0%
the cobalt 19 vaccine is the most
 
00:52:14.950 --> 00:52:14.960 align:start position:0%
effective way we can do that the science
 
00:52:16.870 --> 00:52:16.880 align:start position:0%
and data overwhelmingly demonstrate that
 
00:52:19.030 --> 00:52:19.040 align:start position:0%
the vaccines are safe and effective
 
00:52:21.109 --> 00:52:21.119 align:start position:0%
reduce reduce transmission and prevent
 
00:52:22.710 --> 00:52:22.720 align:start position:0%
serious illness
 
00:52:24.790 --> 00:52:24.800 align:start position:0%
hospitalization and death all of the
 
00:52:26.549 --> 00:52:26.559 align:start position:0%
vaccines authorized for use went through
 
00:52:28.309 --> 00:52:28.319 align:start position:0%
rigorous studies and review by the
 
00:52:30.470 --> 00:52:30.480 align:start position:0%
federal agencies before their approval
 
00:52:31.990 --> 00:52:32.000 align:start position:0%
for emergency use and one of those
 
00:52:33.670 --> 00:52:33.680 align:start position:0%
vaccines has already been fully approved
 
00:52:35.109 --> 00:52:35.119 align:start position:0%
for use by the federal food and drug
 
00:52:35.119 --> 00:52:36.630 align:start position:0%
for use by the federal food and drug
administration

00:52:36.630 --> 00:52:36.640 align:start position:0%
administration
 
00:52:38.710 --> 00:52:38.720 align:start position:0%
requiring vaccinations of our staff from
 
00:52:40.309 --> 00:52:40.319 align:start position:0%
communicable diseases is not new for
 
00:52:41.910 --> 00:52:41.920 align:start position:0%
hospitals in new hampshire hospitals
 
00:52:43.750 --> 00:52:43.760 align:start position:0%
have required vaccination against the
 
00:52:45.670 --> 00:52:45.680 align:start position:0%
flu for instance for many years with the
 
00:52:47.750 --> 00:52:47.760 align:start position:0%
same type of exemptions allowed for
 
00:52:50.309 --> 00:52:50.319 align:start position:0%
relative to the kova 19 vaccines
 
00:52:52.470 --> 00:52:52.480 align:start position:0%
we believe this is absolutely the right
 
00:52:54.230 --> 00:52:54.240 align:start position:0%
thing to do
 
00:52:55.990 --> 00:52:56.000 align:start position:0%
to protect the health and safety of our
 
00:52:58.790 --> 00:52:58.800 align:start position:0%
patients our staff and the community the
 
00:53:00.470 --> 00:53:00.480 align:start position:0%
vast majority of hospital staff have
 
00:53:02.230 --> 00:53:02.240 align:start position:0%
been vaccinated we've heard many from
 
00:53:03.990 --> 00:53:04.000 align:start position:0%
many who support the vaccine requirement
 
00:53:05.510 --> 00:53:05.520 align:start position:0%
to protect their health and that of
 
00:53:07.430 --> 00:53:07.440 align:start position:0%
their patients
 
00:53:09.190 --> 00:53:09.200 align:start position:0%
but let me come back to where i started
 
00:53:12.549 --> 00:53:12.559 align:start position:0%
this conversation hospital bed capacity
 
00:53:14.230 --> 00:53:14.240 align:start position:0%
hospitals have seen a significant
 
00:53:16.150 --> 00:53:16.160 align:start position:0%
increase in patient volumes over the
 
00:53:18.150 --> 00:53:18.160 align:start position:0%
past several months from patients who do
 
00:53:20.390 --> 00:53:20.400 align:start position:0%
not have covid19 but who have other
 
00:53:21.829 --> 00:53:21.839 align:start position:0%
serious illnesses that require
 
00:53:21.839 --> 00:53:23.670 align:start position:0%
serious illnesses that require
hospitalizations

00:53:23.670 --> 00:53:23.680 align:start position:0%
hospitalizations
 
00:53:25.270 --> 00:53:25.280 align:start position:0%
many patients went without care during
 
00:53:26.710 --> 00:53:26.720 align:start position:0%
the pandemic or skipped routine
 
00:53:28.150 --> 00:53:28.160 align:start position:0%
screenings or evaluations and their
 
00:53:31.109 --> 00:53:31.119 align:start position:0%
conditions are now much more serious
 
00:53:33.349 --> 00:53:33.359 align:start position:0%
add to that a surge in cobot 19
 
00:53:35.510 --> 00:53:35.520 align:start position:0%
hospitalizations a workforce shortage
 
00:53:37.270 --> 00:53:37.280 align:start position:0%
that existed before the pandemic and has
 
00:53:39.430 --> 00:53:39.440 align:start position:0%
only been exacerbated because of it and
 
00:53:41.030 --> 00:53:41.040 align:start position:0%
the challenges that hospitals are
 
00:53:42.630 --> 00:53:42.640 align:start position:0%
already experiencing when trying to find
 
00:53:44.470 --> 00:53:44.480 align:start position:0%
a bed especially in intensive care unit
 
00:53:46.230 --> 00:53:46.240 align:start position:0%
bed here in new hampshire or across the
 
00:53:48.150 --> 00:53:48.160 align:start position:0%
region and you can understand the true
 
00:53:49.910 --> 00:53:49.920 align:start position:0%
impact of this pandemic on the health
 
00:53:51.349 --> 00:53:51.359 align:start position:0%
care system
 
00:53:53.430 --> 00:53:53.440 align:start position:0%
as i have said i am incredibly proud of
 
00:53:54.870 --> 00:53:54.880 align:start position:0%
the tremendous work our hospitals and
 
00:53:56.790 --> 00:53:56.800 align:start position:0%
their health care heroes are doing
 
00:53:58.710 --> 00:53:58.720 align:start position:0%
every day to ensure that these patients
 
00:54:00.390 --> 00:54:00.400 align:start position:0%
that their patients are able to get the
 
00:54:02.630 --> 00:54:02.640 align:start position:0%
care they need but if we aren't able to
 
00:54:04.150 --> 00:54:04.160 align:start position:0%
turn the corner on this pandemic and
 
00:54:05.829 --> 00:54:05.839 align:start position:0%
start trending in the right direction
 
00:54:07.109 --> 00:54:07.119 align:start position:0%
with fewer new cases and
 
00:54:09.430 --> 00:54:09.440 align:start position:0%
hospitalizations that job will only
 
00:54:11.349 --> 00:54:11.359 align:start position:0%
become more difficult
 
00:54:13.190 --> 00:54:13.200 align:start position:0%
if we're going to ensure that we have
 
00:54:15.030 --> 00:54:15.040 align:start position:0%
the hospital beds available to care for
 
00:54:16.870 --> 00:54:16.880 align:start position:0%
every patient regardless of whether they
 
00:54:19.510 --> 00:54:19.520 align:start position:0%
are suffering from coba 19 heart attack
 
00:54:21.430 --> 00:54:21.440 align:start position:0%
or the victim of an accident we have to
 
00:54:24.069 --> 00:54:24.079 align:start position:0%
do everything we can now to make that
 
00:54:24.079 --> 00:54:24.950 align:start position:0%
do everything we can now to make that
happen

00:54:24.950 --> 00:54:24.960 align:start position:0%
happen
 
00:54:26.150 --> 00:54:26.160 align:start position:0%
thank you for the opportunity to share
 
00:54:27.589 --> 00:54:27.599 align:start position:0%
our thoughts be happy to answer any
 
00:54:30.950 --> 00:54:30.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:32.309 --> 00:54:32.319 align:start position:0%
great thank you
 
00:54:32.319 --> 00:54:33.270 align:start position:0%
great thank you
members

00:54:33.270 --> 00:54:33.280 align:start position:0%
members
 
00:54:36.829 --> 00:54:36.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:39.430 --> 00:54:39.440 align:start position:0%
erica thank you mr chair thank you for
 
00:54:41.670 --> 00:54:41.680 align:start position:0%
taking the questions uh my first
 
00:54:44.549 --> 00:54:44.559 align:start position:0%
question is to the number of um
 
00:54:46.309 --> 00:54:46.319 align:start position:0%
vaccinated and non-vaccinated are those
 
00:54:47.670 --> 00:54:47.680 align:start position:0%
numbers that are kept by the hospital
 
00:54:49.349 --> 00:54:49.359 align:start position:0%
association or do we speak to the
 
00:54:51.030 --> 00:54:51.040 align:start position:0%
department of public health for those
 
00:54:53.030 --> 00:54:53.040 align:start position:0%
those numbers um are reported by the
 
00:54:56.710 --> 00:54:56.720 align:start position:0%
hospitals uh to the the state um and are
 
00:54:59.270 --> 00:54:59.280 align:start position:0%
available from the state and is there a
 
00:55:00.789 --> 00:55:00.799 align:start position:0%
category for those who have been
 
00:55:02.789 --> 00:55:02.799 align:start position:0%
vaccinated but haven't yet reached that
 
00:55:04.950 --> 00:55:04.960 align:start position:0%
category of fully vaccinated so those
 
00:55:06.789 --> 00:55:06.799 align:start position:0%
who catch it in those first two weeks
 
00:55:09.910 --> 00:55:09.920 align:start position:0%
before full protection we do um
 
00:55:12.309 --> 00:55:12.319 align:start position:0%
hospitals are asked to categorize those
 
00:55:13.670 --> 00:55:13.680 align:start position:0%
patients who are hospitalized whether
 
00:55:15.510 --> 00:55:15.520 align:start position:0%
they have been vaccinated whether
 
00:55:17.589 --> 00:55:17.599 align:start position:0%
they've been fully vaccinated um or not
 
00:55:20.230 --> 00:55:20.240 align:start position:0%
vaccinated at all so those those that is
 
00:55:22.390 --> 00:55:22.400 align:start position:0%
captured in that in that in that respect
 
00:55:23.829 --> 00:55:23.839 align:start position:0%
fantastic i'm glad those three data
 
00:55:26.309 --> 00:55:26.319 align:start position:0%
points are available um let's see and
 
00:55:27.829 --> 00:55:27.839 align:start position:0%
then i have another question on the
 
00:55:29.750 --> 00:55:29.760 align:start position:0%
exemptions for the flu vaccines and the
 
00:55:31.589 --> 00:55:31.599 align:start position:0%
copit vaccines has there been a
 
00:55:33.910 --> 00:55:33.920 align:start position:0%
comparison about the approval rate for
 
00:55:35.990 --> 00:55:36.000 align:start position:0%
religious and medical exemptions for the
 
00:55:37.750 --> 00:55:37.760 align:start position:0%
flu vaccine compared to the cobit
 
00:55:40.789 --> 00:55:40.799 align:start position:0%
vaccine um there is not um as you can
 
00:55:43.510 --> 00:55:43.520 align:start position:0%
expect those um policies are being
 
00:55:45.510 --> 00:55:45.520 align:start position:0%
implemented you know hospital by
 
00:55:47.589 --> 00:55:47.599 align:start position:0%
hospitals so they're not all necessarily
 
00:55:49.270 --> 00:55:49.280 align:start position:0%
the same and they all haven't gone into
 
00:55:52.069 --> 00:55:52.079 align:start position:0%
effect so um some have you know
 
00:55:54.309 --> 00:55:54.319 align:start position:0%
they they're going into effect in this
 
00:55:56.630 --> 00:55:56.640 align:start position:0%
month and next month um and so we don't
 
00:55:58.789 --> 00:55:58.799 align:start position:0%
know what those ultimate
 
00:56:01.030 --> 00:56:01.040 align:start position:0%
percentages might look like at this time
 
00:56:03.270 --> 00:56:03.280 align:start position:0%
okay so with that there's they're not
 
00:56:05.190 --> 00:56:05.200 align:start position:0%
modeling the exemption protocols for the
 
00:56:07.109 --> 00:56:07.119 align:start position:0%
coveted vaccine on the flu vaccine
 
00:56:08.230 --> 00:56:08.240 align:start position:0%
they're trying to look at this one
 
00:56:08.240 --> 00:56:09.349 align:start position:0%
they're trying to look at this one
differently

00:56:09.349 --> 00:56:09.359 align:start position:0%
differently
 
00:56:11.910 --> 00:56:11.920 align:start position:0%
they're using the same methodology some
 
00:56:13.829 --> 00:56:13.839 align:start position:0%
same model that they will be using i
 
00:56:16.309 --> 00:56:16.319 align:start position:0%
just don't have a sense yet as to you
 
00:56:19.430 --> 00:56:19.440 align:start position:0%
know how many are being uh granted and
 
00:56:21.030 --> 00:56:21.040 align:start position:0%
and how many are not those that's just
 
00:56:22.870 --> 00:56:22.880 align:start position:0%
something we don't we don't have thank
 
00:56:24.309 --> 00:56:24.319 align:start position:0%
you i'm sorry i'm getting into those i'm
 
00:56:26.230 --> 00:56:26.240 align:start position:0%
an economist i love data
 
00:56:28.630 --> 00:56:28.640 align:start position:0%
erica can i move on to senator
 
00:56:31.829 --> 00:56:31.839 align:start position:0%
welcome back senator
 
00:56:33.190 --> 00:56:33.200 align:start position:0%
you have a couple more questions if you
 
00:56:33.200 --> 00:56:34.230 align:start position:0%
you have a couple more questions if you
can

00:56:34.230 --> 00:56:34.240 align:start position:0%
can
 
00:56:35.430 --> 00:56:35.440 align:start position:0%
wrap it up
 
00:56:37.109 --> 00:56:37.119 align:start position:0%
actually i'm good to wrap up thank you
 
00:56:39.349 --> 00:56:39.359 align:start position:0%
thank you senator go ahead so there's a
 
00:56:41.030 --> 00:56:41.040 align:start position:0%
microphone over there so people online
 
00:56:45.990 --> 00:56:46.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:47.910 --> 00:56:47.920 align:start position:0%
good morning steve good morning senator
 
00:56:47.920 --> 00:56:48.950 align:start position:0%
good morning steve good morning senator
um

00:56:48.950 --> 00:56:48.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:56:49.990 --> 00:56:50.000 align:start position:0%
we've had
 
00:56:51.990 --> 00:56:52.000 align:start position:0%
a number of conversations over the last
 
00:56:53.829 --> 00:56:53.839 align:start position:0%
couple of months about medical and
 
00:56:55.829 --> 00:56:55.839 align:start position:0%
religious exemptions
 
00:56:57.510 --> 00:56:57.520 align:start position:0%
i just want to say for the record i
 
00:57:00.549 --> 00:57:00.559 align:start position:0%
appreciate the fact that you've been
 
00:57:04.069 --> 00:57:04.079 align:start position:0%
um as willing to
 
00:57:06.069 --> 00:57:06.079 align:start position:0%
as an association and some of your
 
00:57:08.630 --> 00:57:08.640 align:start position:0%
individual members that we've talked to
 
00:57:10.950 --> 00:57:10.960 align:start position:0%
both myself and senator morse
 
00:57:12.390 --> 00:57:12.400 align:start position:0%
as you know
 
00:57:12.400 --> 00:57:13.910 align:start position:0%
as you know
um

00:57:13.910 --> 00:57:13.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:57:16.549 --> 00:57:16.559 align:start position:0%
do you want to comment any further
 
00:57:16.559 --> 00:57:17.670 align:start position:0%
do you want to comment any further
on

00:57:17.670 --> 00:57:17.680 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:57:20.470 --> 00:57:20.480 align:start position:0%
you know what constitutes in some of the
 
00:57:22.390 --> 00:57:22.400 align:start position:0%
members cases the
 
00:57:25.990 --> 00:57:26.000 align:start position:0%
grounds for a medical exception
 
00:57:26.000 --> 00:57:27.589 align:start position:0%
grounds for a medical exception
so

00:57:27.589 --> 00:57:27.599 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:57:30.230 --> 00:57:30.240 align:start position:0%
and i know that every hospital has
 
00:57:32.870 --> 00:57:32.880 align:start position:0%
developed a somewhat different policy so
 
00:57:35.030 --> 00:57:35.040 align:start position:0%
i just but for the record i think it
 
00:57:36.549 --> 00:57:36.559 align:start position:0%
would be good for the
 
00:57:38.829 --> 00:57:38.839 align:start position:0%
committee to hear
 
00:57:42.630 --> 00:57:42.640 align:start position:0%
that your members are responding
 
00:57:42.640 --> 00:57:43.589 align:start position:0%
that your members are responding
to

00:57:43.589 --> 00:57:43.599 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:57:43.599 --> 00:57:44.309 align:start position:0%
to
the

00:57:44.309 --> 00:57:44.319 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:57:47.670 --> 00:57:47.680 align:start position:0%
medical and religious exception requests
 
00:57:49.109 --> 00:57:49.119 align:start position:0%
they they are and they're reviewing
 
00:57:51.589 --> 00:57:51.599 align:start position:0%
those you know on a case-by-case basis i
 
00:57:51.599 --> 00:57:52.309 align:start position:0%
those you know on a case-by-case basis i
think

00:57:52.309 --> 00:57:52.319 align:start position:0%
think
 
00:57:54.710 --> 00:57:54.720 align:start position:0%
your point relative to medical
 
00:57:56.789 --> 00:57:56.799 align:start position:0%
exemptions there's been a lot of um you
 
00:57:59.670 --> 00:57:59.680 align:start position:0%
know questions about um
 
00:58:02.230 --> 00:58:02.240 align:start position:0%
from those who are of child bearing age
 
00:58:04.870 --> 00:58:04.880 align:start position:0%
um and those
 
00:58:07.109 --> 00:58:07.119 align:start position:0%
the the the science and the data would
 
00:58:09.270 --> 00:58:09.280 align:start position:0%
say that they are safe and effective for
 
00:58:11.910 --> 00:58:11.920 align:start position:0%
for those who are in that category um
 
00:58:14.549 --> 00:58:14.559 align:start position:0%
but there are those who are trying to be
 
00:58:16.950 --> 00:58:16.960 align:start position:0%
flexible to ensure that you know those
 
00:58:19.670 --> 00:58:19.680 align:start position:0%
individuals um you know are able to to
 
00:58:21.670 --> 00:58:21.680 align:start position:0%
continue to to participate in the
 
00:58:25.190 --> 00:58:25.200 align:start position:0%
workforce um and perhaps delaying their
 
00:58:29.190 --> 00:58:29.200 align:start position:0%
uh you know date of of a vaccination um
 
00:58:30.710 --> 00:58:30.720 align:start position:0%
and again
 
00:58:32.789 --> 00:58:32.799 align:start position:0%
i can't speak and say what everyone is
 
00:58:34.470 --> 00:58:34.480 align:start position:0%
doing they're doing those things on an
 
00:58:36.150 --> 00:58:36.160 align:start position:0%
individual basis but they're certainly
 
00:58:38.870 --> 00:58:38.880 align:start position:0%
working to try and be um
 
00:58:40.950 --> 00:58:40.960 align:start position:0%
you know as flexible as they can but at
 
00:58:43.109 --> 00:58:43.119 align:start position:0%
the same time ensuring the health and
 
00:58:45.430 --> 00:58:45.440 align:start position:0%
safety of of their their employees and
 
00:58:49.349 --> 00:58:49.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:50.950 --> 00:58:50.960 align:start position:0%
so um
 
00:58:53.910 --> 00:58:53.920 align:start position:0%
i guess just more comment at this point
 
00:58:56.950 --> 00:58:56.960 align:start position:0%
i i think recognizing
 
00:58:56.960 --> 00:58:58.549 align:start position:0%
i i think recognizing
the

00:58:58.549 --> 00:58:58.559 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:59:00.390 --> 00:59:00.400 align:start position:0%
work that you folks have done all of
 
00:59:00.400 --> 00:59:01.270 align:start position:0%
work that you folks have done all of
your

00:59:01.270 --> 00:59:01.280 align:start position:0%
your
 
00:59:05.109 --> 00:59:05.119 align:start position:0%
you know 26 members and trying to keep
 
00:59:08.069 --> 00:59:08.079 align:start position:0%
people safe and get the care that they
 
00:59:10.470 --> 00:59:10.480 align:start position:0%
need over the last
 
00:59:12.549 --> 00:59:12.559 align:start position:0%
almost two years has been exceptional i
 
00:59:14.470 --> 00:59:14.480 align:start position:0%
don't think anybody could say
 
00:59:17.829 --> 00:59:17.839 align:start position:0%
it is anything other than exceptional so
 
00:59:17.839 --> 00:59:20.230 align:start position:0%
it is anything other than exceptional so
um

00:59:20.230 --> 00:59:20.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:22.230 --> 00:59:22.240 align:start position:0%
that just needs to be said steve so
 
00:59:24.390 --> 00:59:24.400 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you
 
00:59:26.150 --> 00:59:26.160 align:start position:0%
i would also
 
00:59:28.309 --> 00:59:28.319 align:start position:0%
um say
 
00:59:30.069 --> 00:59:30.079 align:start position:0%
i think you're between a rock and a hard
 
00:59:30.079 --> 00:59:31.030 align:start position:0%
i think you're between a rock and a hard
plate

00:59:31.030 --> 00:59:31.040 align:start position:0%
plate
 
00:59:33.910 --> 00:59:33.920 align:start position:0%
um in terms of
 
00:59:35.030 --> 00:59:35.040 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:59:36.710 --> 00:59:36.720 align:start position:0%
trying to keep your patients safe trying
 
00:59:39.270 --> 00:59:39.280 align:start position:0%
to keep your staff safe but also
 
00:59:39.280 --> 00:59:41.190 align:start position:0%
to keep your staff safe but also
recognizing

00:59:41.190 --> 00:59:41.200 align:start position:0%
recognizing
 
00:59:44.069 --> 00:59:44.079 align:start position:0%
um the fact that some people have qualms
 
00:59:46.549 --> 00:59:46.559 align:start position:0%
and i think you know whether it's
 
00:59:50.309 --> 00:59:50.319 align:start position:0%
myocarditis women of childbearing age
 
00:59:52.710 --> 00:59:52.720 align:start position:0%
people that have already had covid
 
00:59:52.720 --> 00:59:53.750 align:start position:0%
people that have already had covid
um

00:59:53.750 --> 00:59:53.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:59:57.190 --> 00:59:57.200 align:start position:0%
so i i just want to say i think that
 
01:00:00.150 --> 01:00:00.160 align:start position:0%
the response by the hospital association
 
01:00:02.230 --> 01:00:02.240 align:start position:0%
and your members
 
01:00:04.150 --> 01:00:04.160 align:start position:0%
for that kind of flexibility on
 
01:00:06.710 --> 01:00:06.720 align:start position:0%
religious and medical exceptions it's
 
01:00:06.720 --> 01:00:08.069 align:start position:0%
religious and medical exceptions it's
difficult

01:00:08.069 --> 01:00:08.079 align:start position:0%
difficult
 
01:00:09.910 --> 01:00:09.920 align:start position:0%
there's no question about that it's
 
01:00:09.920 --> 01:00:11.430 align:start position:0%
there's no question about that it's
difficult

01:00:11.430 --> 01:00:11.440 align:start position:0%
difficult
 
01:00:14.549 --> 01:00:14.559 align:start position:0%
but i appreciate that flexibility
 
01:00:17.589 --> 01:00:17.599 align:start position:0%
there's no question it it is a it is a
 
01:00:20.870 --> 01:00:20.880 align:start position:0%
difficult implementation for sure um but
 
01:00:22.390 --> 01:00:22.400 align:start position:0%
in terms of
 
01:00:22.400 --> 01:00:23.349 align:start position:0%
in terms of
our

01:00:23.349 --> 01:00:23.359 align:start position:0%
our
 
01:00:25.990 --> 01:00:26.000 align:start position:0%
primary responsibility and focus has to
 
01:00:27.990 --> 01:00:28.000 align:start position:0%
be on the health and safety of our
 
01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:29.030 align:start position:0%
be on the health and safety of our
patients

01:00:29.030 --> 01:00:29.040 align:start position:0%
patients
 
01:00:32.150 --> 01:00:32.160 align:start position:0%
our staff and our community um so i
 
01:00:34.309 --> 01:00:34.319 align:start position:0%
understand the challenge that it creates
 
01:00:36.390 --> 01:00:36.400 align:start position:0%
um but i think
 
01:00:37.990 --> 01:00:38.000 align:start position:0%
when our hospitals step forward and
 
01:00:39.990 --> 01:00:40.000 align:start position:0%
remember this was before uh federal
 
01:00:42.630 --> 01:00:42.640 align:start position:0%
mandates uh you know were announced
 
01:00:44.630 --> 01:00:44.640 align:start position:0%
they felt it was absolutely the right
 
01:00:46.549 --> 01:00:46.559 align:start position:0%
thing to do from a public health
 
01:00:46.559 --> 01:00:47.750 align:start position:0%
thing to do from a public health
perspective

01:00:47.750 --> 01:00:47.760 align:start position:0%
perspective
 
01:00:49.910 --> 01:00:49.920 align:start position:0%
to protect the health and safety of of
 
01:00:51.190 --> 01:00:51.200 align:start position:0%
their patients
 
01:00:53.589 --> 01:00:53.599 align:start position:0%
we know that those who have received the
 
01:00:55.349 --> 01:00:55.359 align:start position:0%
covet 19 vaccine
 
01:00:57.670 --> 01:00:57.680 align:start position:0%
are much less likely to
 
01:01:00.390 --> 01:01:00.400 align:start position:0%
be infected to face serious illness and
 
01:01:03.270 --> 01:01:03.280 align:start position:0%
hospitalization and and death and that
 
01:01:05.510 --> 01:01:05.520 align:start position:0%
has to be our primary focus and you know
 
01:01:08.390 --> 01:01:08.400 align:start position:0%
the reality is as i said we are seeing
 
01:01:10.470 --> 01:01:10.480 align:start position:0%
you know an increasing number of of
 
01:01:13.270 --> 01:01:13.280 align:start position:0%
covet 19 cases and
 
01:01:15.510 --> 01:01:15.520 align:start position:0%
that you know the need to to increase
 
01:01:17.349 --> 01:01:17.359 align:start position:0%
our vaccination rates along with all of
 
01:01:18.870 --> 01:01:18.880 align:start position:0%
the other public health measures that
 
01:01:20.150 --> 01:01:20.160 align:start position:0%
we've talked about
 
01:01:22.069 --> 01:01:22.079 align:start position:0%
are so vitally important
 
01:01:23.670 --> 01:01:23.680 align:start position:0%
to put us in the right direction we all
 
01:01:25.589 --> 01:01:25.599 align:start position:0%
want to get back to normal when covet
 
01:01:27.510 --> 01:01:27.520 align:start position:0%
isn't calling the shots um when we can
 
01:01:30.549 --> 01:01:30.559 align:start position:0%
do what you know we want to do um
 
01:01:32.950 --> 01:01:32.960 align:start position:0%
and we strongly believe that that the
 
01:01:35.430 --> 01:01:35.440 align:start position:0%
vaccine is is the the path forward and
 
01:01:36.950 --> 01:01:36.960 align:start position:0%
that's why our hospitals step forward to
 
01:01:41.030 --> 01:01:41.040 align:start position:0%
to require that their their employees
 
01:01:42.789 --> 01:01:42.799 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
01:01:46.549 --> 01:01:46.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:48.549 --> 01:01:48.559 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question and
 
01:01:50.710 --> 01:01:50.720 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony
 
01:01:52.630 --> 01:01:52.640 align:start position:0%
i just had a thought
 
01:01:54.390 --> 01:01:54.400 align:start position:0%
um i know that
 
01:01:57.109 --> 01:01:57.119 align:start position:0%
there are some people who
 
01:02:00.470 --> 01:02:00.480 align:start position:0%
object to getting the vaccine because of
 
01:02:02.870 --> 01:02:02.880 align:start position:0%
the documentation
 
01:02:04.870 --> 01:02:04.880 align:start position:0%
you think that they're you know having
 
01:02:06.470 --> 01:02:06.480 align:start position:0%
to give their name and their life
 
01:02:08.230 --> 01:02:08.240 align:start position:0%
history and blah blah
 
01:02:10.870 --> 01:02:10.880 align:start position:0%
i wonder if
 
01:02:14.710 --> 01:02:14.720 align:start position:0%
there would ever be a consideration for
 
01:02:17.029 --> 01:02:17.039 align:start position:0%
people to be able to
 
01:02:17.039 --> 01:02:19.190 align:start position:0%
people to be able to
just

01:02:19.190 --> 01:02:19.200 align:start position:0%
just
 
01:02:22.470 --> 01:02:22.480 align:start position:0%
come in get the vaccine in a specific
 
01:02:24.309 --> 01:02:24.319 align:start position:0%
place and just be
 
01:02:24.319 --> 01:02:25.430 align:start position:0%
place and just be
numbered

01:02:25.430 --> 01:02:25.440 align:start position:0%
numbered
 
01:02:28.150 --> 01:02:28.160 align:start position:0%
rather than have to give their name or
 
01:02:30.870 --> 01:02:30.880 align:start position:0%
maybe just give their name but not
 
01:02:33.349 --> 01:02:33.359 align:start position:0%
have to give all other information that
 
01:02:34.710 --> 01:02:34.720 align:start position:0%
just seems
 
01:02:36.390 --> 01:02:36.400 align:start position:0%
i know there are people like that out
 
01:02:38.789 --> 01:02:38.799 align:start position:0%
there who just don't want
 
01:02:41.990 --> 01:02:42.000 align:start position:0%
to be documented they feel that's above
 
01:02:43.510 --> 01:02:43.520 align:start position:0%
and beyond their
 
01:02:46.789 --> 01:02:46.799 align:start position:0%
privacy because it's more open than
 
01:02:48.710 --> 01:02:48.720 align:start position:0%
your record with your doctor or
 
01:02:50.950 --> 01:02:50.960 align:start position:0%
something like that and was that ever
 
01:02:53.990 --> 01:02:54.000 align:start position:0%
given any consideration at all
 
01:02:56.870 --> 01:02:56.880 align:start position:0%
just an open clinic to go you know i
 
01:02:59.670 --> 01:02:59.680 align:start position:0%
don't know i don't remember back
 
01:03:01.670 --> 01:03:01.680 align:start position:0%
when i was in school when they had the
 
01:03:01.680 --> 01:03:02.630 align:start position:0%
when i was in school when they had the
mass

01:03:02.630 --> 01:03:02.640 align:start position:0%
mass
 
01:03:05.430 --> 01:03:05.440 align:start position:0%
inoculations for polio and stuff like
 
01:03:07.510 --> 01:03:07.520 align:start position:0%
that if we had to
 
01:03:09.910 --> 01:03:09.920 align:start position:0%
give our names or
 
01:03:13.029 --> 01:03:13.039 align:start position:0%
i don't remember that my new detail
 
01:03:14.710 --> 01:03:14.720 align:start position:0%
probably in fifth grade or something
 
01:03:16.950 --> 01:03:16.960 align:start position:0%
like that i assume you're referring to
 
01:03:19.750 --> 01:03:19.760 align:start position:0%
the the vaccine registry right um you
 
01:03:22.069 --> 01:03:22.079 align:start position:0%
know that is something new hampshire's
 
01:03:25.510 --> 01:03:25.520 align:start position:0%
the last state in the country to enact
 
01:03:28.069 --> 01:03:28.079 align:start position:0%
a vaccine registry it's an important
 
01:03:31.029 --> 01:03:31.039 align:start position:0%
public health tool um you know making
 
01:03:32.710 --> 01:03:32.720 align:start position:0%
certain that we can
 
01:03:35.349 --> 01:03:35.359 align:start position:0%
track that vaccine and that dose and
 
01:03:37.750 --> 01:03:37.760 align:start position:0%
that lot so in case there were any
 
01:03:39.750 --> 01:03:39.760 align:start position:0%
issues and those those types of things i
 
01:03:41.670 --> 01:03:41.680 align:start position:0%
absolutely believe that that vaccine
 
01:03:44.069 --> 01:03:44.079 align:start position:0%
registry needs to be um you know
 
01:03:46.150 --> 01:03:46.160 align:start position:0%
protected um so that that data is
 
01:03:48.470 --> 01:03:48.480 align:start position:0%
protected um but i have but i do believe
 
01:03:50.230 --> 01:03:50.240 align:start position:0%
that that it is important and a helpful
 
01:03:52.470 --> 01:03:52.480 align:start position:0%
public health tool one that um can help
 
01:03:55.190 --> 01:03:55.200 align:start position:0%
us in in in the fight against covet 19
 
01:03:57.270 --> 01:03:57.280 align:start position:0%
but i i absolutely do believe that we
 
01:03:59.430 --> 01:03:59.440 align:start position:0%
need to ensure that that data is is kept
 
01:04:01.990 --> 01:04:02.000 align:start position:0%
uh private um because it should be yeah
 
01:04:04.069 --> 01:04:04.079 align:start position:0%
thank you i have one more mr ad
 
01:04:04.079 --> 01:04:05.349 align:start position:0%
thank you i have one more mr ad
representative

01:04:05.349 --> 01:04:05.359 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:04:07.670 --> 01:04:07.680 align:start position:0%
people who have had covet
 
01:04:09.190 --> 01:04:09.200 align:start position:0%
and even those who have been
 
01:04:13.430 --> 01:04:13.440 align:start position:0%
hospitalized by being one um
 
01:04:16.390 --> 01:04:16.400 align:start position:0%
had a blood i had a blood test and said
 
01:04:18.549 --> 01:04:18.559 align:start position:0%
that i have the i still have the
 
01:04:18.559 --> 01:04:21.109 align:start position:0%
that i have the i still have the
antibodies

01:04:21.109 --> 01:04:21.119 align:start position:0%
antibodies
 
01:04:23.029 --> 01:04:23.039 align:start position:0%
is there any
 
01:04:26.630 --> 01:04:26.640 align:start position:0%
consideration that's given to
 
01:04:28.630 --> 01:04:28.640 align:start position:0%
uh i think you kind of
 
01:04:31.270 --> 01:04:31.280 align:start position:0%
mentioned that in in in one of your
 
01:04:33.510 --> 01:04:33.520 align:start position:0%
statements toward the end of your
 
01:04:33.520 --> 01:04:35.109 align:start position:0%
statements toward the end of your
presentation

01:04:35.109 --> 01:04:35.119 align:start position:0%
presentation
 
01:04:37.829 --> 01:04:37.839 align:start position:0%
that um there's
 
01:04:40.150 --> 01:04:40.160 align:start position:0%
there's no distinction
 
01:04:42.950 --> 01:04:42.960 align:start position:0%
if if you're hesit like if you're
 
01:04:45.750 --> 01:04:45.760 align:start position:0%
hesitant to get the vaccine after you
 
01:04:45.760 --> 01:04:46.789 align:start position:0%
hesitant to get the vaccine after you
have

01:04:46.789 --> 01:04:46.799 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:04:49.270 --> 01:04:49.280 align:start position:0%
um have had covert
 
01:04:52.470 --> 01:04:52.480 align:start position:0%
because there are conflicting
 
01:04:54.789 --> 01:04:54.799 align:start position:0%
reports of how
 
01:04:57.349 --> 01:04:57.359 align:start position:0%
uh that could affect your your immune
 
01:04:59.750 --> 01:04:59.760 align:start position:0%
system or whether it's good for you or
 
01:04:59.760 --> 01:05:00.789 align:start position:0%
system or whether it's good for you or
whatever

01:05:00.789 --> 01:05:00.799 align:start position:0%
whatever
 
01:05:03.829 --> 01:05:03.839 align:start position:0%
is there any consideration given to
 
01:05:06.069 --> 01:05:06.079 align:start position:0%
people who have had
 
01:05:08.390 --> 01:05:08.400 align:start position:0%
covet or do you know like when they go
 
01:05:10.470 --> 01:05:10.480 align:start position:0%
to a nursing home or something like that
 
01:05:11.670 --> 01:05:11.680 align:start position:0%
are there any
 
01:05:13.589 --> 01:05:13.599 align:start position:0%
are those personal
 
01:05:13.599 --> 01:05:15.510 align:start position:0%
are those personal
um

01:05:15.510 --> 01:05:15.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:05:18.630 --> 01:05:18.640 align:start position:0%
uh personal decisions that are made
 
01:05:20.470 --> 01:05:20.480 align:start position:0%
through the individual
 
01:05:23.270 --> 01:05:23.280 align:start position:0%
nursing homes or are these mandates uh
 
01:05:24.870 --> 01:05:24.880 align:start position:0%
that you have to wear face shield you
 
01:05:26.630 --> 01:05:26.640 align:start position:0%
have to wear this because you don't have
 
01:05:28.630 --> 01:05:28.640 align:start position:0%
the vaccine but even though you've had
 
01:05:30.230 --> 01:05:30.240 align:start position:0%
it it doesn't matter that you have the
 
01:05:33.430 --> 01:05:33.440 align:start position:0%
antibodies is that some decision that
 
01:05:34.829 --> 01:05:34.839 align:start position:0%
that is made
 
01:05:38.789 --> 01:05:38.799 align:start position:0%
locally uh or is that something that's
 
01:05:40.230 --> 01:05:40.240 align:start position:0%
comes from
 
01:05:42.950 --> 01:05:42.960 align:start position:0%
the state agencies well number one i'm
 
01:05:45.109 --> 01:05:45.119 align:start position:0%
glad to see you here um
 
01:05:46.309 --> 01:05:46.319 align:start position:0%
you've obviously uh recommended it it
 
01:05:48.309 --> 01:05:48.319 align:start position:0%
was a long haul um so i'm glad that
 
01:05:50.630 --> 01:05:50.640 align:start position:0%
you're you're well um you know we've
 
01:05:50.640 --> 01:05:51.910 align:start position:0%
you're you're well um you know we've
certainly

01:05:51.910 --> 01:05:51.920 align:start position:0%
certainly
 
01:05:55.270 --> 01:05:55.280 align:start position:0%
we're learning a lot um about covet as
 
01:05:58.150 --> 01:05:58.160 align:start position:0%
we go through this um a recent study
 
01:06:02.309 --> 01:06:02.319 align:start position:0%
of 7 000 hospitalized patients who had
 
01:06:04.309 --> 01:06:04.319 align:start position:0%
covet 19 who who had coped 19 and
 
01:06:06.950 --> 01:06:06.960 align:start position:0%
therefore um had the antibodies um were
 
01:06:09.670 --> 01:06:09.680 align:start position:0%
still significantly you know more likely
 
01:06:13.029 --> 01:06:13.039 align:start position:0%
to you know be reinfected with copa 19
 
01:06:15.109 --> 01:06:15.119 align:start position:0%
um and that's why you know it has been
 
01:06:17.270 --> 01:06:17.280 align:start position:0%
and continues to be a recommendation for
 
01:06:20.150 --> 01:06:20.160 align:start position:0%
those that have had cover 19 to also get
 
01:06:22.390 --> 01:06:22.400 align:start position:0%
the vaccine um as it provides even
 
01:06:25.029 --> 01:06:25.039 align:start position:0%
further um you know immunity against
 
01:06:27.910 --> 01:06:27.920 align:start position:0%
covet 19. um as it as relates to who
 
01:06:31.270 --> 01:06:31.280 align:start position:0%
makes that determination um i believe
 
01:06:31.280 --> 01:06:32.309 align:start position:0%
makes that determination um i believe
the

01:06:32.309 --> 01:06:32.319 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:06:32.319 --> 01:06:33.750 align:start position:0%
the
the

01:06:33.750 --> 01:06:33.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:06:36.549 --> 01:06:36.559 align:start position:0%
the instruction or the direction um that
 
01:06:37.990 --> 01:06:38.000 align:start position:0%
is coming from you know public health
 
01:06:39.510 --> 01:06:39.520 align:start position:0%
agencies you know whether it's federal
 
01:06:42.870 --> 01:06:42.880 align:start position:0%
state or or or local has been um that
 
01:06:46.870 --> 01:06:46.880 align:start position:0%
that is not um sufficient um to you know
 
01:06:49.430 --> 01:06:49.440 align:start position:0%
demonstrate um you know immunity against
 
01:06:50.789 --> 01:06:50.799 align:start position:0%
the the
 
01:06:53.349 --> 01:06:53.359 align:start position:0%
against copa 19 and and uh would
 
01:06:55.990 --> 01:06:56.000 align:start position:0%
therefore if there was a mandate um that
 
01:06:57.990 --> 01:06:58.000 align:start position:0%
it would be required that that that you
 
01:06:59.990 --> 01:07:00.000 align:start position:0%
get that um even though you've had cobia
 
01:07:02.069 --> 01:07:02.079 align:start position:0%
19 before
 
01:07:07.750 --> 01:07:07.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:09.430 --> 01:07:09.440 align:start position:0%
would it be possible to get that study
 
01:07:14.069 --> 01:07:14.079 align:start position:0%
from you your email later thank you
 
01:07:14.079 --> 01:07:15.109 align:start position:0%
from you your email later thank you
anything

01:07:15.109 --> 01:07:15.119 align:start position:0%
anything
 
01:07:17.349 --> 01:07:17.359 align:start position:0%
so i i have a couple questions
 
01:07:17.359 --> 01:07:18.150 align:start position:0%
so i i have a couple questions
so

01:07:18.150 --> 01:07:18.160 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:07:18.160 --> 01:07:20.470 align:start position:0%
so
um

01:07:20.470 --> 01:07:20.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:07:22.710 --> 01:07:22.720 align:start position:0%
we're going to start with them with with
 
01:07:25.109 --> 01:07:25.119 align:start position:0%
breakthrough cases and the and and
 
01:07:26.630 --> 01:07:26.640 align:start position:0%
what's happening there and relative to
 
01:07:29.430 --> 01:07:29.440 align:start position:0%
the hospital's response to those and
 
01:07:32.390 --> 01:07:32.400 align:start position:0%
inflict and and imposing a mandate
 
01:07:32.400 --> 01:07:33.750 align:start position:0%
inflict and and imposing a mandate
um

01:07:33.750 --> 01:07:33.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:07:35.589 --> 01:07:35.599 align:start position:0%
so given that we know that breakthrough
 
01:07:38.150 --> 01:07:38.160 align:start position:0%
cases happen right we know that
 
01:07:39.829 --> 01:07:39.839 align:start position:0%
my understanding is roughly one in ten
 
01:07:42.789 --> 01:07:42.799 align:start position:0%
of the hospitalizations currently are
 
01:07:45.029 --> 01:07:45.039 align:start position:0%
at a minimum one in ten are
 
01:07:46.789 --> 01:07:46.799 align:start position:0%
breakthrough cases that are at the
 
01:07:46.799 --> 01:07:47.990 align:start position:0%
breakthrough cases that are at the
hospitals

01:07:47.990 --> 01:07:48.000 align:start position:0%
hospitals
 
01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:49.910 align:start position:0%
hospitals
[Applause]

01:07:49.910 --> 01:07:49.920 align:start position:0%
[Applause]
 
01:07:51.910 --> 01:07:51.920 align:start position:0%
given that we know that
 
01:07:54.710 --> 01:07:54.720 align:start position:0%
a vaccine mandate on employees as
 
01:07:57.670 --> 01:07:57.680 align:start position:0%
compared to testing right again if your
 
01:08:00.150 --> 01:08:00.160 align:start position:0%
goal is to
 
01:08:01.910 --> 01:08:01.920 align:start position:0%
make sure that your patients are safe
 
01:08:04.390 --> 01:08:04.400 align:start position:0%
and your workforce can show up for work
 
01:08:04.400 --> 01:08:05.349 align:start position:0%
and your workforce can show up for work
um

01:08:05.349 --> 01:08:05.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:08:07.829 --> 01:08:07.839 align:start position:0%
isn't testing for infection status given
 
01:08:09.589 --> 01:08:09.599 align:start position:0%
that we know that vax people who are
 
01:08:11.109 --> 01:08:11.119 align:start position:0%
vaccinated could still be infectious
 
01:08:12.870 --> 01:08:12.880 align:start position:0%
still shed the disease the virus and
 
01:08:14.549 --> 01:08:14.559 align:start position:0%
still infect other people
 
01:08:17.189 --> 01:08:17.199 align:start position:0%
wouldn't infection status testing be
 
01:08:19.269 --> 01:08:19.279 align:start position:0%
more accurate in order to protect and be
 
01:08:19.279 --> 01:08:20.070 align:start position:0%
more accurate in order to protect and be
be

01:08:20.070 --> 01:08:20.080 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:08:21.910 --> 01:08:21.920 align:start position:0%
you know be more absolute in achieving
 
01:08:23.749 --> 01:08:23.759 align:start position:0%
your goal of patient safety rather than
 
01:08:26.070 --> 01:08:26.080 align:start position:0%
vaccine status
 
01:08:29.749 --> 01:08:29.759 align:start position:0%
it's certainly an important component of
 
01:08:31.590 --> 01:08:31.600 align:start position:0%
cover 19 mitigation
 
01:08:33.590 --> 01:08:33.600 align:start position:0%
but it's not an absolute
 
01:08:36.630 --> 01:08:36.640 align:start position:0%
because you know as we have certainly
 
01:08:39.829 --> 01:08:39.839 align:start position:0%
come to know that someone can
 
01:08:39.839 --> 01:08:40.550 align:start position:0%
come to know that someone can
be

01:08:40.550 --> 01:08:40.560 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:08:43.349 --> 01:08:43.359 align:start position:0%
asymptomatic and yet continue to shed
 
01:08:44.550 --> 01:08:44.560 align:start position:0%
that virus
 
01:08:47.749 --> 01:08:47.759 align:start position:0%
and even can be tested um and may not
 
01:08:49.030 --> 01:08:49.040 align:start position:0%
uh you know
 
01:08:51.990 --> 01:08:52.000 align:start position:0%
produce enough uh for the test to show
 
01:08:54.229 --> 01:08:54.239 align:start position:0%
that they are coveted positive um and
 
01:08:56.229 --> 01:08:56.239 align:start position:0%
therefore i i would say that that's not
 
01:08:58.630 --> 01:08:58.640 align:start position:0%
an absolute that that we would um
 
01:09:00.149 --> 01:09:00.159 align:start position:0%
suggest is is
 
01:09:02.149 --> 01:09:02.159 align:start position:0%
would would be uh
 
01:09:04.070 --> 01:09:04.080 align:start position:0%
a replacement uh for a vaccine
 
01:09:04.080 --> 01:09:05.110 align:start position:0%
a replacement uh for a vaccine
requirement

01:09:05.110 --> 01:09:05.120 align:start position:0%
requirement
 
01:09:07.269 --> 01:09:07.279 align:start position:0%
again we we know that
 
01:09:09.829 --> 01:09:09.839 align:start position:0%
those who are vaccinated are less much
 
01:09:12.550 --> 01:09:12.560 align:start position:0%
less likely to you know become infected
 
01:09:14.229 --> 01:09:14.239 align:start position:0%
to have serious illness
 
01:09:19.669 --> 01:09:19.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:21.189 --> 01:09:21.199 align:start position:0%
but currently you don't do any testing
 
01:09:23.030 --> 01:09:23.040 align:start position:0%
is that right that that the testing that
 
01:09:25.349 --> 01:09:25.359 align:start position:0%
is done is only at a at an employee's
 
01:09:27.990 --> 01:09:28.000 align:start position:0%
request that that again we know that
 
01:09:29.510 --> 01:09:29.520 align:start position:0%
breakthrough cases have we know we have
 
01:09:32.149 --> 01:09:32.159 align:start position:0%
hospitalizations on those and and we
 
01:09:34.789 --> 01:09:34.799 align:start position:0%
have no idea whether or not an employee
 
01:09:36.709 --> 01:09:36.719 align:start position:0%
is currently walking the hospital is
 
01:09:38.229 --> 01:09:38.239 align:start position:0%
infected or not right because we don't
 
01:09:39.349 --> 01:09:39.359 align:start position:0%
do any testing we know they've got the
 
01:09:41.110 --> 01:09:41.120 align:start position:0%
virus because you've a virus the
 
01:09:43.110 --> 01:09:43.120 align:start position:0%
vaccination but we don't know what their
 
01:09:45.590 --> 01:09:45.600 align:start position:0%
infection status is so the protection to
 
01:09:47.510 --> 01:09:47.520 align:start position:0%
the public is what
 
01:09:48.709 --> 01:09:48.719 align:start position:0%
well we
 
01:09:50.630 --> 01:09:50.640 align:start position:0%
we know that if they are vax if they are
 
01:09:52.630 --> 01:09:52.640 align:start position:0%
fully vaccinated they are much less
 
01:09:55.110 --> 01:09:55.120 align:start position:0%
likely to become infected and to shed
 
01:09:57.669 --> 01:09:57.679 align:start position:0%
the virus um and to the extent that
 
01:10:00.149 --> 01:10:00.159 align:start position:0%
there's testing that goes on um it
 
01:10:02.470 --> 01:10:02.480 align:start position:0%
revolves around for for vaccinated
 
01:10:05.270 --> 01:10:05.280 align:start position:0%
employees um would be uh you know if
 
01:10:07.189 --> 01:10:07.199 align:start position:0%
they are experiencing symptoms or if
 
01:10:09.590 --> 01:10:09.600 align:start position:0%
they have had a close contact actually
 
01:10:11.110 --> 01:10:11.120 align:start position:0%
um the
 
01:10:13.910 --> 01:10:13.920 align:start position:0%
the guidance um does not suggest that um
 
01:10:16.709 --> 01:10:16.719 align:start position:0%
if you've been a close contact that you
 
01:10:20.070 --> 01:10:20.080 align:start position:0%
were required to be tested it is not not
 
01:10:22.149 --> 01:10:22.159 align:start position:0%
a not a bad thing to do
 
01:10:23.189 --> 01:10:23.199 align:start position:0%
and some
 
01:10:25.430 --> 01:10:25.440 align:start position:0%
institutions may may be doing that
 
01:10:25.440 --> 01:10:26.550 align:start position:0%
institutions may may be doing that
themselves

01:10:26.550 --> 01:10:26.560 align:start position:0%
themselves
 
01:10:29.110 --> 01:10:29.120 align:start position:0%
but the the current guidelines suggest
 
01:10:31.270 --> 01:10:31.280 align:start position:0%
that if you were fully vaccinated you
 
01:10:33.350 --> 01:10:33.360 align:start position:0%
have the highest protection in addition
 
01:10:34.950 --> 01:10:34.960 align:start position:0%
to all of the other things that that we
 
01:10:37.270 --> 01:10:37.280 align:start position:0%
do in the hospital um in terms of you
 
01:10:39.510 --> 01:10:39.520 align:start position:0%
know personal protective equipment air
 
01:10:41.669 --> 01:10:41.679 align:start position:0%
flow and all of the other
 
01:10:44.310 --> 01:10:44.320 align:start position:0%
infection prevention mitigation efforts
 
01:10:45.830 --> 01:10:45.840 align:start position:0%
and i very much appreciate that i i
 
01:10:47.430 --> 01:10:47.440 align:start position:0%
guess my question goes back to what you
 
01:10:48.950 --> 01:10:48.960 align:start position:0%
were just talking about was that the
 
01:10:50.630 --> 01:10:50.640 align:start position:0%
fact that we know that if you get
 
01:10:53.030 --> 01:10:53.040 align:start position:0%
vaccinated your symptoms are more likely
 
01:10:54.950 --> 01:10:54.960 align:start position:0%
less so you're less
 
01:10:56.070 --> 01:10:56.080 align:start position:0%
we know that's not going to cause
 
01:10:57.750 --> 01:10:57.760 align:start position:0%
hospitalization your symptoms way less
 
01:10:59.350 --> 01:10:59.360 align:start position:0%
the person may be less likely to
 
01:11:01.270 --> 01:11:01.280 align:start position:0%
understand if they're even infected
 
01:11:03.430 --> 01:11:03.440 align:start position:0%
and we're not testing them and we know
 
01:11:05.510 --> 01:11:05.520 align:start position:0%
breakthrough cases happen so
 
01:11:07.430 --> 01:11:07.440 align:start position:0%
how how does that protect the model how
 
01:11:09.110 --> 01:11:09.120 align:start position:0%
is that a protective model versus
 
01:11:11.110 --> 01:11:11.120 align:start position:0%
testing on a regular basis
 
01:11:12.709 --> 01:11:12.719 align:start position:0%
there's no
 
01:11:13.910 --> 01:11:13.920 align:start position:0%
whether it's
 
01:11:16.070 --> 01:11:16.080 align:start position:0%
a testing protocol whether it's a
 
01:11:18.149 --> 01:11:18.159 align:start position:0%
vaccine protocol whether it's a face
 
01:11:19.669 --> 01:11:19.679 align:start position:0%
mask whether it's hand washing whether
 
01:11:22.870 --> 01:11:22.880 align:start position:0%
it's sanitization there there is no
 
01:11:26.550 --> 01:11:26.560 align:start position:0%
method that is 100 percent effective
 
01:11:27.830 --> 01:11:27.840 align:start position:0%
they all
 
01:11:30.390 --> 01:11:30.400 align:start position:0%
sort of they get layered together and
 
01:11:34.070 --> 01:11:34.080 align:start position:0%
the most effective means of preventing
 
01:11:36.870 --> 01:11:36.880 align:start position:0%
infection hospitalization and death
 
01:11:39.270 --> 01:11:39.280 align:start position:0%
remains the copa 19 one of the three
 
01:11:41.830 --> 01:11:41.840 align:start position:0%
code 19 vaccines okay
 
01:11:44.229 --> 01:11:44.239 align:start position:0%
um follow-up question is relative to we
 
01:11:47.910 --> 01:11:47.920 align:start position:0%
know that again the covid vaccine is i'm
 
01:11:49.189 --> 01:11:49.199 align:start position:0%
going to stick to that because it's a
 
01:11:51.590 --> 01:11:51.600 align:start position:0%
topic we're on right now but the um the
 
01:11:54.310 --> 01:11:54.320 align:start position:0%
covid vaccine is not curative in nature
 
01:11:56.870 --> 01:11:56.880 align:start position:0%
it's mitigating in nature right and we
 
01:11:59.030 --> 01:11:59.040 align:start position:0%
know that over time it's been it's been
 
01:12:01.590 --> 01:12:01.600 align:start position:0%
shown that the protection wanes and we
 
01:12:03.270 --> 01:12:03.280 align:start position:0%
need booster shots
 
01:12:05.750 --> 01:12:05.760 align:start position:0%
so is it is it the hospital's intent or
 
01:12:08.950 --> 01:12:08.960 align:start position:0%
or or follow-up to mandate this vaccine
 
01:12:10.630 --> 01:12:10.640 align:start position:0%
for a lifetime and all the boosters that
 
01:12:12.790 --> 01:12:12.800 align:start position:0%
follow so we're doing a lifetime of
 
01:12:15.270 --> 01:12:15.280 align:start position:0%
injections on on all workers
 
01:12:15.280 --> 01:12:19.270 align:start position:0%
injections on on all workers
um

01:12:19.270 --> 01:12:19.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:21.510 --> 01:12:21.520 align:start position:0%
to be considered fully vaccinated
 
01:12:23.910 --> 01:12:23.920 align:start position:0%
remains you know having either one of
 
01:12:25.590 --> 01:12:25.600 align:start position:0%
the two dosed uh
 
01:12:28.630 --> 01:12:28.640 align:start position:0%
models or the the one dose j and j um i
 
01:12:30.950 --> 01:12:30.960 align:start position:0%
do not know um and
 
01:12:33.750 --> 01:12:33.760 align:start position:0%
i i we have not um you know spoken or
 
01:12:35.350 --> 01:12:35.360 align:start position:0%
asked the the question of the hospitals
 
01:12:37.590 --> 01:12:37.600 align:start position:0%
whether whether or not the booster um
 
01:12:39.590 --> 01:12:39.600 align:start position:0%
will be included as part of that mandate
 
01:12:40.630 --> 01:12:40.640 align:start position:0%
i think we're
 
01:12:42.709 --> 01:12:42.719 align:start position:0%
i mean those boosters were just uh
 
01:12:44.709 --> 01:12:44.719 align:start position:0%
approved um here recently so that's a
 
01:12:46.709 --> 01:12:46.719 align:start position:0%
question that i don't know the answer to
 
01:12:49.510 --> 01:12:49.520 align:start position:0%
that but as i understand it um
 
01:12:52.149 --> 01:12:52.159 align:start position:0%
full immunity continues to be defined as
 
01:12:55.430 --> 01:12:55.440 align:start position:0%
uh the the two dose uh you know pfizer
 
01:12:58.630 --> 01:12:58.640 align:start position:0%
or moderna and the one dose jnj
 
01:12:58.640 --> 01:12:59.350 align:start position:0%
or moderna and the one dose jnj
so

01:12:59.350 --> 01:12:59.360 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:13:01.030 --> 01:13:01.040 align:start position:0%
again to follow up with that so but we
 
01:13:02.950 --> 01:13:02.960 align:start position:0%
know that i think
 
01:13:04.870 --> 01:13:04.880 align:start position:0%
healthcare workers were in the first
 
01:13:07.510 --> 01:13:07.520 align:start position:0%
wave of and so that was may of last year
 
01:13:08.630 --> 01:13:08.640 align:start position:0%
i think it was
 
01:13:10.790 --> 01:13:10.800 align:start position:0%
for roosters yeah no for just the
 
01:13:12.310 --> 01:13:12.320 align:start position:0%
vaccine right
 
01:13:14.630 --> 01:13:14.640 align:start position:0%
started back in december of of 2020
 
01:13:16.470 --> 01:13:16.480 align:start position:0%
december of 2020
 
01:13:18.709 --> 01:13:18.719 align:start position:0%
and again if i follow studies right and
 
01:13:20.470 --> 01:13:20.480 align:start position:0%
you can obviously correct me if my wrong
 
01:13:21.990 --> 01:13:22.000 align:start position:0%
i think that i think the studies have
 
01:13:23.430 --> 01:13:23.440 align:start position:0%
shown that after three months the
 
01:13:25.189 --> 01:13:25.199 align:start position:0%
vaccine starts to wane after six months
 
01:13:26.790 --> 01:13:26.800 align:start position:0%
it's really whether whether or not it's
 
01:13:28.870 --> 01:13:28.880 align:start position:0%
effective or not so all right i don't
 
01:13:29.990 --> 01:13:30.000 align:start position:0%
think the question is whether it's
 
01:13:32.229 --> 01:13:32.239 align:start position:0%
effective or not after six months but it
 
01:13:34.310 --> 01:13:34.320 align:start position:0%
is recommended that at six months the
 
01:13:37.669 --> 01:13:37.679 align:start position:0%
vaccine immunity has begun to to wane
 
01:13:39.910 --> 01:13:39.920 align:start position:0%
and therefore uh ensure that for those
 
01:13:42.470 --> 01:13:42.480 align:start position:0%
that are immunocompromised who are more
 
01:13:45.030 --> 01:13:45.040 align:start position:0%
susceptible to covet 19 those that work
 
01:13:47.030 --> 01:13:47.040 align:start position:0%
in high risk occupations like health
 
01:13:47.040 --> 01:13:47.910 align:start position:0%
in high risk occupations like health
care

01:13:47.910 --> 01:13:47.920 align:start position:0%
care
 
01:13:49.669 --> 01:13:49.679 align:start position:0%
should consider getting the the the
 
01:13:49.679 --> 01:13:53.510 align:start position:0%
should consider getting the the the
booster

01:13:53.510 --> 01:13:53.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:53.520 --> 01:13:55.590 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:13:55.590 --> 01:13:55.600 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:13:57.030 --> 01:13:57.040 align:start position:0%
and then the last question i have is
 
01:13:59.270 --> 01:13:59.280 align:start position:0%
relative the same same question i posed
 
01:14:01.350 --> 01:14:01.360 align:start position:0%
to the um
 
01:14:02.870 --> 01:14:02.880 align:start position:0%
to the business industry are you
 
01:14:04.390 --> 01:14:04.400 align:start position:0%
concerned about any liability by a
 
01:14:06.790 --> 01:14:06.800 align:start position:0%
forced mandate that might be pushed down
 
01:14:09.750 --> 01:14:09.760 align:start position:0%
to you for immunization and and either a
 
01:14:12.950 --> 01:14:12.960 align:start position:0%
death or um or injury that results as a
 
01:14:15.430 --> 01:14:15.440 align:start position:0%
vaccination that was caused by a mandate
 
01:14:16.870 --> 01:14:16.880 align:start position:0%
that the business would be liable of
 
01:14:19.430 --> 01:14:19.440 align:start position:0%
that given that the um
 
01:14:19.440 --> 01:14:20.390 align:start position:0%
that given that the um
the

01:14:20.390 --> 01:14:20.400 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:14:21.990 --> 01:14:22.000 align:start position:0%
pharmaceutical industry the
 
01:14:23.510 --> 01:14:23.520 align:start position:0%
vaccine manufacturer have been given
 
01:14:26.390 --> 01:14:26.400 align:start position:0%
broad immunity from lawsuit
 
01:14:28.070 --> 01:14:28.080 align:start position:0%
as you heard from others i think you
 
01:14:30.630 --> 01:14:30.640 align:start position:0%
know there's there's liability um
 
01:14:32.950 --> 01:14:32.960 align:start position:0%
whether there's a vaccine requirement or
 
01:14:35.350 --> 01:14:35.360 align:start position:0%
not um but i
 
01:14:36.149 --> 01:14:36.159 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:14:39.830 --> 01:14:39.840 align:start position:0%
vaccine requirements are not new um i i
 
01:14:41.910 --> 01:14:41.920 align:start position:0%
believe you know in my heart that they
 
01:14:43.910 --> 01:14:43.920 align:start position:0%
are the right thing um and i believe
 
01:14:45.990 --> 01:14:46.000 align:start position:0%
that hospitals and employers should have
 
01:14:49.270 --> 01:14:49.280 align:start position:0%
the right to require that um and um
 
01:14:49.280 --> 01:14:51.030 align:start position:0%
the right to require that um and um
so

01:14:51.030 --> 01:14:51.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:14:52.630 --> 01:14:52.640 align:start position:0%
thank you any further questions from the
 
01:14:55.270 --> 01:14:55.280 align:start position:0%
committee representative leon um thank
 
01:14:57.430 --> 01:14:57.440 align:start position:0%
you um as to that study did that
 
01:14:59.030 --> 01:14:59.040 align:start position:0%
evaluate both those who had been
 
01:15:01.189 --> 01:15:01.199 align:start position:0%
recently immunized for covid and those
 
01:15:03.750 --> 01:15:03.760 align:start position:0%
with the natural immunity
 
01:15:03.760 --> 01:15:04.790 align:start position:0%
with the natural immunity
so

01:15:04.790 --> 01:15:04.800 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:15:04.800 --> 01:15:06.070 align:start position:0%
so
the

01:15:06.070 --> 01:15:06.080 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:15:08.229 --> 01:15:08.239 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure what how to define recently
 
01:15:10.390 --> 01:15:10.400 align:start position:0%
um since we're only dealing with people
 
01:15:11.990 --> 01:15:12.000 align:start position:0%
who've been able to be vaccinated within
 
01:15:13.270 --> 01:15:13.280 align:start position:0%
the last
 
01:15:16.470 --> 01:15:16.480 align:start position:0%
less than 12 months so um i think so i
 
01:15:19.590 --> 01:15:19.600 align:start position:0%
think the answer is yes okay um because
 
01:15:20.950 --> 01:15:20.960 align:start position:0%
um i i
 
01:15:22.550 --> 01:15:22.560 align:start position:0%
have there's some scientific question as
 
01:15:25.189 --> 01:15:25.199 align:start position:0%
to the as for the sample size in that
 
01:15:27.590 --> 01:15:27.600 align:start position:0%
study and also i do know that some of
 
01:15:29.430 --> 01:15:29.440 align:start position:0%
the statements that have been made have
 
01:15:31.350 --> 01:15:31.360 align:start position:0%
referenced blog articles and that sort
 
01:15:33.189 --> 01:15:33.199 align:start position:0%
of level of evidence as we get more
 
01:15:35.189 --> 01:15:35.199 align:start position:0%
information will the new hampshire
 
01:15:37.590 --> 01:15:37.600 align:start position:0%
hospital association look to those a and
 
01:15:40.470 --> 01:15:40.480 align:start position:0%
b quality of evidence as we're able to
 
01:15:42.950 --> 01:15:42.960 align:start position:0%
develop more clinical experience we
 
01:15:44.709 --> 01:15:44.719 align:start position:0%
always will be looking at the the
 
01:15:46.070 --> 01:15:46.080 align:start position:0%
clinical evidence and the clinical
 
01:15:46.080 --> 01:15:47.590 align:start position:0%
clinical evidence and the clinical
experience

01:15:47.590 --> 01:15:47.600 align:start position:0%
experience
 
01:15:49.270 --> 01:15:49.280 align:start position:0%
to help guide our decision making and
 
01:15:51.270 --> 01:15:51.280 align:start position:0%
that's what our hospitals are doing um
 
01:15:53.750 --> 01:15:53.760 align:start position:0%
and so we will continue to to evaluate
 
01:15:56.390 --> 01:15:56.400 align:start position:0%
all of that we believe that the the data
 
01:15:58.149 --> 01:15:58.159 align:start position:0%
and the the science has been
 
01:16:01.350 --> 01:16:01.360 align:start position:0%
overwhelming uh in favor of the vaccines
 
01:16:03.110 --> 01:16:03.120 align:start position:0%
but we will continue to look at all of
 
01:16:05.189 --> 01:16:05.199 align:start position:0%
that um and make any
 
01:16:08.070 --> 01:16:08.080 align:start position:0%
adjustments as necessary
 
01:16:10.550 --> 01:16:10.560 align:start position:0%
in my last follow-up outside of an
 
01:16:13.110 --> 01:16:13.120 align:start position:0%
emerging situation such as this a lot of
 
01:16:14.470 --> 01:16:14.480 align:start position:0%
these levels of evidence would be
 
01:16:16.709 --> 01:16:16.719 align:start position:0%
classified as level c or d because
 
01:16:18.470 --> 01:16:18.480 align:start position:0%
observational studies and other
 
01:16:20.790 --> 01:16:20.800 align:start position:0%
methodological problems
 
01:16:22.630 --> 01:16:22.640 align:start position:0%
i know that we're limited in what we
 
01:16:25.750 --> 01:16:25.760 align:start position:0%
know but i just want assurance that as
 
01:16:28.310 --> 01:16:28.320 align:start position:0%
the standard of evidence increases it
 
01:16:31.030 --> 01:16:31.040 align:start position:0%
will be more discriminating as to which
 
01:16:33.110 --> 01:16:33.120 align:start position:0%
which science we follow and which ones
 
01:16:35.990 --> 01:16:36.000 align:start position:0%
we've done more research and and realize
 
01:16:38.310 --> 01:16:38.320 align:start position:0%
the way that uh science has moved
 
01:16:40.550 --> 01:16:40.560 align:start position:0%
we will continue to use evidence-based
 
01:16:43.750 --> 01:16:43.760 align:start position:0%
uh protocols to uh to adopt policies and
 
01:16:45.910 --> 01:16:45.920 align:start position:0%
procedures and protocols um to ensure
 
01:16:47.830 --> 01:16:47.840 align:start position:0%
the health and safety of our workforce i
 
01:16:49.910 --> 01:16:49.920 align:start position:0%
can assure you that thank you
 
01:16:51.830 --> 01:16:51.840 align:start position:0%
representative shaw yes just a quick
 
01:16:54.149 --> 01:16:54.159 align:start position:0%
comment um
 
01:16:56.149 --> 01:16:56.159 align:start position:0%
i have to tell you that
 
01:16:59.590 --> 01:16:59.600 align:start position:0%
in my 11 days in the hospital
 
01:17:01.430 --> 01:17:01.440 align:start position:0%
the elliott hospital
 
01:17:04.390 --> 01:17:04.400 align:start position:0%
care that i received was
 
01:17:07.189 --> 01:17:07.199 align:start position:0%
absolutely superior i
 
01:17:10.070 --> 01:17:10.080 align:start position:0%
i it's always been my hospital to go to
 
01:17:13.350 --> 01:17:13.360 align:start position:0%
for testing and stuff had three children
 
01:17:15.189 --> 01:17:15.199 align:start position:0%
uh there but
 
01:17:16.950 --> 01:17:16.960 align:start position:0%
that i never had
 
01:17:21.110 --> 01:17:21.120 align:start position:0%
any type of surgery or long-term care
 
01:17:22.310 --> 01:17:22.320 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
01:17:27.110 --> 01:17:27.120 align:start position:0%
i was just amazed at the um at the care
 
01:17:31.430 --> 01:17:31.440 align:start position:0%
and uh the uh you know it was
 
01:17:34.950 --> 01:17:34.960 align:start position:0%
i was very pleased and i uh i think that
 
01:17:36.870 --> 01:17:36.880 align:start position:0%
the decision of your
 
01:17:40.470 --> 01:17:40.480 align:start position:0%
um uh hospital associations
 
01:17:43.189 --> 01:17:43.199 align:start position:0%
to have a group
 
01:17:45.990 --> 01:17:46.000 align:start position:0%
like a group it was like a unit
 
01:17:47.750 --> 01:17:47.760 align:start position:0%
for um
 
01:17:49.830 --> 01:17:49.840 align:start position:0%
for covet in it we had they had
 
01:17:52.709 --> 01:17:52.719 align:start position:0%
in-service doctors this new thing about
 
01:17:56.630 --> 01:17:56.640 align:start position:0%
a unit of doctors for the hospital um it
 
01:18:00.070 --> 01:18:00.080 align:start position:0%
is an amazing thing and it took them 79
 
01:18:01.910 --> 01:18:01.920 align:start position:0%
years to get me in there but i only
 
01:18:03.270 --> 01:18:03.280 align:start position:0%
stayed 11.
 
01:18:05.270 --> 01:18:05.280 align:start position:0%
but well i'm so i'm so glad you had a
 
01:18:07.750 --> 01:18:07.760 align:start position:0%
positive experience and i really did
 
01:18:16.630 --> 01:18:16.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:17.990 --> 01:18:18.000 align:start position:0%
i see you
 
01:18:19.669 --> 01:18:19.679 align:start position:0%
intensive care unit
 
01:18:22.310 --> 01:18:22.320 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you no thank you and and i i
 
01:18:24.229 --> 01:18:24.239 align:start position:0%
just want to sort of build on that
 
01:18:24.239 --> 01:18:25.750 align:start position:0%
just want to sort of build on that
comment

01:18:25.750 --> 01:18:25.760 align:start position:0%
comment
 
01:18:27.430 --> 01:18:27.440 align:start position:0%
you know we talk a lot about the
 
01:18:29.830 --> 01:18:29.840 align:start position:0%
important role that that hospitals play
 
01:18:31.750 --> 01:18:31.760 align:start position:0%
in their community every day
 
01:18:33.750 --> 01:18:33.760 align:start position:0%
they stand ready to care
 
01:18:36.310 --> 01:18:36.320 align:start position:0%
for anyone and everyone regardless of
 
01:18:38.229 --> 01:18:38.239 align:start position:0%
who they are what's happened to them
 
01:18:40.149 --> 01:18:40.159 align:start position:0%
what's in their wallet um or where
 
01:18:42.470 --> 01:18:42.480 align:start position:0%
they're from and you know the the blue
 
01:18:43.590 --> 01:18:43.600 align:start position:0%
and white h that we see in our
 
01:18:45.990 --> 01:18:46.000 align:start position:0%
communities you know stands for the
 
01:18:48.070 --> 01:18:48.080 align:start position:0%
mission and commitment that our
 
01:18:49.669 --> 01:18:49.679 align:start position:0%
hospitals and their caregivers make
 
01:18:52.630 --> 01:18:52.640 align:start position:0%
every single day they come into work uh
 
01:18:54.709 --> 01:18:54.719 align:start position:0%
to care for others to help improve
 
01:18:56.870 --> 01:18:56.880 align:start position:0%
health uh to relieve suffering and and
 
01:18:58.950 --> 01:18:58.960 align:start position:0%
that they do it with such great care and
 
01:19:00.950 --> 01:19:00.960 align:start position:0%
compassion but i must say they're
 
01:19:02.950 --> 01:19:02.960 align:start position:0%
they're getting tired um they've been in
 
01:19:06.229 --> 01:19:06.239 align:start position:0%
this sprint for the last 18 19 months
 
01:19:07.830 --> 01:19:07.840 align:start position:0%
and you know they want to get back to
 
01:19:09.990 --> 01:19:10.000 align:start position:0%
normal they want to be able to say to
 
01:19:12.550 --> 01:19:12.560 align:start position:0%
any hospital to any patient please we'd
 
01:19:14.630 --> 01:19:14.640 align:start position:0%
love to to serve you we'd love to take
 
01:19:16.950 --> 01:19:16.960 align:start position:0%
that transfer um you know we'd love to
 
01:19:18.630 --> 01:19:18.640 align:start position:0%
be able to to care for for those
 
01:19:20.790 --> 01:19:20.800 align:start position:0%
patients and that job is getting so much
 
01:19:23.590 --> 01:19:23.600 align:start position:0%
more challenging as we deal with the
 
01:19:25.990 --> 01:19:26.000 align:start position:0%
rise in in in hospitalizations not just
 
01:19:28.550 --> 01:19:28.560 align:start position:0%
covet but non-coven and all of the rest
 
01:19:31.189 --> 01:19:31.199 align:start position:0%
um and so as i said you know earlier you
 
01:19:33.510 --> 01:19:33.520 align:start position:0%
know those caregivers are the backbone
 
01:19:35.669 --> 01:19:35.679 align:start position:0%
of of what we do and and they took great
 
01:19:37.110 --> 01:19:37.120 align:start position:0%
care of you and i'm so pleased to hear
 
01:19:39.110 --> 01:19:39.120 align:start position:0%
that um but uh
 
01:19:41.669 --> 01:19:41.679 align:start position:0%
we we owe our hospitals a dedica of debt
 
01:19:43.270 --> 01:19:43.280 align:start position:0%
of gratitude uh for the work that
 
01:19:44.870 --> 01:19:44.880 align:start position:0%
they've done and continue to do and
 
01:19:47.430 --> 01:19:47.440 align:start position:0%
we'll continue
 
01:19:49.750 --> 01:19:49.760 align:start position:0%
just one real quick follow-up
 
01:19:52.470 --> 01:19:52.480 align:start position:0%
i my one of the most impressive things
 
01:19:55.430 --> 01:19:55.440 align:start position:0%
that i saw in the hospitals was the fact
 
01:19:55.440 --> 01:19:57.189 align:start position:0%
that i saw in the hospitals was the fact
that

01:19:57.189 --> 01:19:57.199 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:20:00.470 --> 01:20:00.480 align:start position:0%
uh i had two two roommates that came and
 
01:20:04.149 --> 01:20:04.159 align:start position:0%
went that were uh did not speak english
 
01:20:07.189 --> 01:20:07.199 align:start position:0%
and they are able to use a laptop
 
01:20:09.590 --> 01:20:09.600 align:start position:0%
to connect with an interpreter
 
01:20:11.590 --> 01:20:11.600 align:start position:0%
that talks to
 
01:20:13.990 --> 01:20:14.000 align:start position:0%
that patient in their language
 
01:20:16.629 --> 01:20:16.639 align:start position:0%
and makes them understand and relaxes
 
01:20:17.669 --> 01:20:17.679 align:start position:0%
them and
 
01:20:19.990 --> 01:20:20.000 align:start position:0%
lets them know what's going on
 
01:20:22.590 --> 01:20:22.600 align:start position:0%
and they were both totally
 
01:20:25.270 --> 01:20:25.280 align:start position:0%
non-nonverbal in english and i found
 
01:20:27.350 --> 01:20:27.360 align:start position:0%
that to be absolutely amazing and
 
01:20:27.360 --> 01:20:28.390 align:start position:0%
that to be absolutely amazing and
wonderful

01:20:28.390 --> 01:20:28.400 align:start position:0%
wonderful
 
01:20:31.430 --> 01:20:31.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:35.110 --> 01:20:35.120 align:start position:0%
thank you and and i think jeff go ahead
 
01:20:37.350 --> 01:20:37.360 align:start position:0%
thank mr chair and thank you for being
 
01:20:39.990 --> 01:20:40.000 align:start position:0%
here um i also have i have a daughter
 
01:20:41.830 --> 01:20:41.840 align:start position:0%
who's an icu nurse and has dealt with
 
01:20:43.990 --> 01:20:44.000 align:start position:0%
many covert patients so yes they do get
 
01:20:46.229 --> 01:20:46.239 align:start position:0%
tired and they do get wary thank you
 
01:20:48.629 --> 01:20:48.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:50.629 --> 01:20:50.639 align:start position:0%
um i brought up
 
01:20:52.310 --> 01:20:52.320 align:start position:0%
earlier about
 
01:20:55.110 --> 01:20:55.120 align:start position:0%
to go with vaccination and possible
 
01:20:59.030 --> 01:20:59.040 align:start position:0%
boosters and they may continue on as
 
01:21:00.950 --> 01:21:00.960 align:start position:0%
the efficacy wanes
 
01:21:03.430 --> 01:21:03.440 align:start position:0%
boosters may be necessary and continue
 
01:21:06.149 --> 01:21:06.159 align:start position:0%
on or as another variant may become
 
01:21:06.159 --> 01:21:07.350 align:start position:0%
on or as another variant may become
available

01:21:07.350 --> 01:21:07.360 align:start position:0%
available
 
01:21:07.360 --> 01:21:09.350 align:start position:0%
available
um

01:21:09.350 --> 01:21:09.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:21:10.310 --> 01:21:10.320 align:start position:0%
and then
 
01:21:11.830 --> 01:21:11.840 align:start position:0%
those vaccines would be required for
 
01:21:13.030 --> 01:21:13.040 align:start position:0%
your employees to protect both the
 
01:21:15.910 --> 01:21:15.920 align:start position:0%
employees and the patients
 
01:21:17.830 --> 01:21:17.840 align:start position:0%
wouldn't that be similar to the same
 
01:21:19.830 --> 01:21:19.840 align:start position:0%
thing as
 
01:21:22.550 --> 01:21:22.560 align:start position:0%
your employees being required yearly
 
01:21:25.189 --> 01:21:25.199 align:start position:0%
to get a flu vaccine
 
01:21:26.950 --> 01:21:26.960 align:start position:0%
in a similarity yes
 
01:21:30.229 --> 01:21:30.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:33.110 --> 01:21:33.120 align:start position:0%
thank you jeff anything else so again i
 
01:21:34.229 --> 01:21:34.239 align:start position:0%
think i speak to the entire committee
 
01:21:36.149 --> 01:21:36.159 align:start position:0%
when i say that obviously we we very
 
01:21:37.510 --> 01:21:37.520 align:start position:0%
much appreciate our frontline workers
 
01:21:39.350 --> 01:21:39.360 align:start position:0%
and we understand the stress and strain
 
01:21:41.189 --> 01:21:41.199 align:start position:0%
i i have to pull up as you were talking
 
01:21:43.110 --> 01:21:43.120 align:start position:0%
about hospital utilization
 
01:21:45.910 --> 01:21:45.920 align:start position:0%
from the hhs.gov website the hospital
 
01:21:47.270 --> 01:21:47.280 align:start position:0%
utilization and
 
01:21:49.430 --> 01:21:49.440 align:start position:0%
for for the committee's just knowledge
 
01:21:50.950 --> 01:21:50.960 align:start position:0%
is that according to this out of the
 
01:21:53.669 --> 01:21:53.679 align:start position:0%
3021 beds that we have available in new
 
01:21:55.910 --> 01:21:55.920 align:start position:0%
hampshire on 30 hospitals reporting
 
01:21:59.350 --> 01:21:59.360 align:start position:0%
approximately 6.52 percent are in use by
 
01:22:00.709 --> 01:22:00.719 align:start position:0%
covid patients
 
01:22:02.470 --> 01:22:02.480 align:start position:0%
the balance are for other patients that
 
01:22:04.790 --> 01:22:04.800 align:start position:0%
are not covid related so less than 10
 
01:22:07.510 --> 01:22:07.520 align:start position:0%
percent nearly 5 percent are
 
01:22:09.350 --> 01:22:09.360 align:start position:0%
actually covered patients
 
01:22:11.910 --> 01:22:11.920 align:start position:0%
and how that's impacting our hospitals
 
01:22:13.990 --> 01:22:14.000 align:start position:0%
um i i did have one you made a comment i
 
01:22:15.910 --> 01:22:15.920 align:start position:0%
made a note to ask you about it so we
 
01:22:16.790 --> 01:22:16.800 align:start position:0%
talked about a little bit about the
 
01:22:16.800 --> 01:22:18.070 align:start position:0%
talked about a little bit about the
registry

01:22:18.070 --> 01:22:18.080 align:start position:0%
registry
 
01:22:18.080 --> 01:22:18.950 align:start position:0%
registry
um

01:22:18.950 --> 01:22:18.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:22:21.030 --> 01:22:21.040 align:start position:0%
and i i just i had a secondary question
 
01:22:21.830 --> 01:22:21.840 align:start position:0%
because you were talking about how
 
01:22:24.229 --> 01:22:24.239 align:start position:0%
important it was and i'm like isn't it i
 
01:22:25.430 --> 01:22:25.440 align:start position:0%
thought it was true because i used to
 
01:22:26.950 --> 01:22:26.960 align:start position:0%
work in healthcare i t and install
 
01:22:28.709 --> 01:22:28.719 align:start position:0%
electronic medical record systems and
 
01:22:30.229 --> 01:22:30.239 align:start position:0%
isn't it true that a doctor has an
 
01:22:33.350 --> 01:22:33.360 align:start position:0%
obligation to record any patient
 
01:22:35.430 --> 01:22:35.440 align:start position:0%
procedure or contact within their within
 
01:22:36.870 --> 01:22:36.880 align:start position:0%
their record keeping system whatever
 
01:22:38.950 --> 01:22:38.960 align:start position:0%
that is including their electronic
 
01:22:40.790 --> 01:22:40.800 align:start position:0%
medical record system so the registry
 
01:22:42.870 --> 01:22:42.880 align:start position:0%
isn't the sole
 
01:22:44.790 --> 01:22:44.800 align:start position:0%
you know place this resides that each
 
01:22:46.790 --> 01:22:46.800 align:start position:0%
provider already keeps these records or
 
01:22:48.229 --> 01:22:48.239 align:start position:0%
are obligated to keep the records
 
01:22:50.229 --> 01:22:50.239 align:start position:0%
actually um and that's as a secondary
 
01:22:50.239 --> 01:22:51.270 align:start position:0%
actually um and that's as a secondary
component

01:22:51.270 --> 01:22:51.280 align:start position:0%
component
 
01:22:53.590 --> 01:22:53.600 align:start position:0%
that's correct although as you know the
 
01:22:56.470 --> 01:22:56.480 align:start position:0%
current registry does allow for patients
 
01:22:57.830 --> 01:22:57.840 align:start position:0%
to opt out
 
01:23:00.629 --> 01:23:00.639 align:start position:0%
of the registry so they can keep that
 
01:23:02.790 --> 01:23:02.800 align:start position:0%
information from the registry um you
 
01:23:04.870 --> 01:23:04.880 align:start position:0%
know the the doctor would certainly want
 
01:23:06.629 --> 01:23:06.639 align:start position:0%
to have that information in their
 
01:23:08.070 --> 01:23:08.080 align:start position:0%
medical records so that they had a
 
01:23:09.910 --> 01:23:09.920 align:start position:0%
complete history
 
01:23:11.910 --> 01:23:11.920 align:start position:0%
of that patient's health and and health
 
01:23:11.920 --> 01:23:13.110 align:start position:0%
of that patient's health and and health
care

01:23:13.110 --> 01:23:13.120 align:start position:0%
care
 
01:23:14.470 --> 01:23:14.480 align:start position:0%
thank you i just want to make sure i was
 
01:23:16.070 --> 01:23:16.080 align:start position:0%
clear that that was in fact that the
 
01:23:17.590 --> 01:23:17.600 align:start position:0%
doctor keeps the record and the
 
01:23:19.189 --> 01:23:19.199 align:start position:0%
secondary record is the registry that
 
01:23:21.510 --> 01:23:21.520 align:start position:0%
the primary record is the doctor's emr
 
01:23:25.030 --> 01:23:25.040 align:start position:0%
who actually performed the procedure
 
01:23:27.030 --> 01:23:27.040 align:start position:0%
anything else
 
01:23:27.040 --> 01:23:27.830 align:start position:0%
anything else
nope

01:23:27.830 --> 01:23:27.840 align:start position:0%

requirements for medical interventions
 
01:25:32.149 --> 01:25:32.159 align:start position:0%
for attending schools in new hampshire
 
01:25:34.070 --> 01:25:34.080 align:start position:0%
particularly immunizations as this seems
 
01:25:36.550 --> 01:25:36.560 align:start position:0%
to be a primary focus of this bill
 
01:25:38.229 --> 01:25:38.239 align:start position:0%
to start i wanted to do a quick review
 
01:25:39.910 --> 01:25:39.920 align:start position:0%
process on the process for vaccines
 
01:25:42.149 --> 01:25:42.159 align:start position:0%
recommended for children in general
 
01:25:44.149 --> 01:25:44.159 align:start position:0%
once a vaccine for an infectious agent
 
01:25:45.910 --> 01:25:45.920 align:start position:0%
has been developed the vaccine goes
 
01:25:47.669 --> 01:25:47.679 align:start position:0%
through four phases of trials looking at
 
01:25:49.990 --> 01:25:50.000 align:start position:0%
both safety and efficacy
 
01:25:51.990 --> 01:25:52.000 align:start position:0%
if it is shown to be safe and effective
 
01:25:53.910 --> 01:25:53.920 align:start position:0%
it will go to the fda the food and drug
 
01:25:53.920 --> 01:25:55.270 align:start position:0%
it will go to the fda the food and drug
administration

01:25:55.270 --> 01:25:55.280 align:start position:0%
administration
 
01:25:57.350 --> 01:25:57.360 align:start position:0%
for approval and licensing
 
01:25:59.830 --> 01:25:59.840 align:start position:0%
after that process uh we've started to
 
01:26:02.870 --> 01:26:02.880 align:start position:0%
see this on the news regularly that goes
 
01:26:04.950 --> 01:26:04.960 align:start position:0%
to the centers for disease control and
 
01:26:07.430 --> 01:26:07.440 align:start position:0%
their advisory committee on immunization
 
01:26:09.430 --> 01:26:09.440 align:start position:0%
practices the acip
 
01:26:10.790 --> 01:26:10.800 align:start position:0%
that committee specifically looks at
 
01:26:13.189 --> 01:26:13.199 align:start position:0%
that data and makes recommendations for
 
01:26:15.750 --> 01:26:15.760 align:start position:0%
who is most at risk in this population
 
01:26:18.390 --> 01:26:18.400 align:start position:0%
what's the dose what's the timing
 
01:26:19.910 --> 01:26:19.920 align:start position:0%
who should and should not get this
 
01:26:19.920 --> 01:26:21.750 align:start position:0%
who should and should not get this
vaccine

01:26:21.750 --> 01:26:21.760 align:start position:0%
vaccine
 
01:26:25.510 --> 01:26:25.520 align:start position:0%
and then the head of the cdc ultimately
 
01:26:27.030 --> 01:26:27.040 align:start position:0%
weighs in on that there are committees
 
01:26:28.870 --> 01:26:28.880 align:start position:0%
within the american academy of
 
01:26:30.550 --> 01:26:30.560 align:start position:0%
pediatrics and the american academy of
 
01:26:32.149 --> 01:26:32.159 align:start position:0%
family practice who also review this
 
01:26:34.390 --> 01:26:34.400 align:start position:0%
data and make recommendations on the
 
01:26:36.070 --> 01:26:36.080 align:start position:0%
vaccine scheduling as well and it's the
 
01:26:37.669 --> 01:26:37.679 align:start position:0%
consensus of these three groups of
 
01:26:39.430 --> 01:26:39.440 align:start position:0%
experts that creates the recommended
 
01:26:41.189 --> 01:26:41.199 align:start position:0%
vaccine schedule
 
01:26:43.350 --> 01:26:43.360 align:start position:0%
this is regularly reviewed and updated
 
01:26:46.390 --> 01:26:46.400 align:start position:0%
with new vaccines covid19 being one hpv
 
01:26:48.950 --> 01:26:48.960 align:start position:0%
being available in the last 20 years a
 
01:26:51.910 --> 01:26:51.920 align:start position:0%
modified vaccines diphtheria tetanus and
 
01:26:54.149 --> 01:26:54.159 align:start position:0%

01:27:03.110 --> 01:27:03.120 align:start position:0%
example
 
01:27:05.510 --> 01:27:05.520 align:start position:0%
in my career has changed the indication
 
01:27:07.910 --> 01:27:07.920 align:start position:0%
and the timing for patients
 
01:27:09.189 --> 01:27:09.199 align:start position:0%
and it's based on this expert-led
 
01:27:10.470 --> 01:27:10.480 align:start position:0%
vaccine schedule that school
 
01:27:12.470 --> 01:27:12.480 align:start position:0%
requirements have been made
 
01:27:15.030 --> 01:27:15.040 align:start position:0%
now understanding uh vaccines their
 
01:27:17.110 --> 01:27:17.120 align:start position:0%
origin and their guideline i want to
 
01:27:18.550 --> 01:27:18.560 align:start position:0%
consider the environment of our public
 
01:27:20.709 --> 01:27:20.719 align:start position:0%
school settings our schools are open to
 
01:27:23.030 --> 01:27:23.040 align:start position:0%
everyone in our state
 
01:27:25.110 --> 01:27:25.120 align:start position:0%
we meet the needs of our most vulnerable
 
01:27:25.120 --> 01:27:26.070 align:start position:0%
we meet the needs of our most vulnerable
patients

01:27:26.070 --> 01:27:26.080 align:start position:0%
patients
 
01:27:27.510 --> 01:27:27.520 align:start position:0%
with services originating at their
 
01:27:29.750 --> 01:27:29.760 align:start position:0%
schools the federal guidelines say that
 
01:27:31.430 --> 01:27:31.440 align:start position:0%
starting at age three
 
01:27:33.350 --> 01:27:33.360 align:start position:0%
those medically vulnerable children get
 
01:27:34.550 --> 01:27:34.560 align:start position:0%
their physical therapy their
 
01:27:35.990 --> 01:27:36.000 align:start position:0%
occupational therapy their speech
 
01:27:37.510 --> 01:27:37.520 align:start position:0%
therapy through our public school
 
01:27:40.149 --> 01:27:40.159 align:start position:0%
systems they may learn to eat speak and
 
01:27:44.310 --> 01:27:44.320 align:start position:0%
walk in our elementary schools
 
01:27:44.320 --> 01:27:45.350 align:start position:0%
walk in our elementary schools
the

01:27:45.350 --> 01:27:45.360 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:27:47.669 --> 01:27:47.679 align:start position:0%
education in our united states and in
 
01:27:50.229 --> 01:27:50.239 align:start position:0%
new hampshire is compulsory
 
01:27:52.870 --> 01:27:52.880 align:start position:0%
there is no exemption based on who sits
 
01:27:54.470 --> 01:27:54.480 align:start position:0%
next to you in class
 
01:27:58.310 --> 01:27:58.320 align:start position:0%
your potential earning power your
 
01:28:00.149 --> 01:28:00.159 align:start position:0%
expected lifespan the complexity of your
 
01:28:01.430 --> 01:28:01.440 align:start position:0%
health needs
 
01:28:03.750 --> 01:28:03.760 align:start position:0%
you must attend school and for this
 
01:28:05.510 --> 01:28:05.520 align:start position:0%
reason your school needs to be a safe
 
01:28:07.750 --> 01:28:07.760 align:start position:0%
place for all who do not choose to seek
 
01:28:09.350 --> 01:28:09.360 align:start position:0%
their education elsewhere
 
01:28:10.550 --> 01:28:10.560 align:start position:0%
there are basic requirements of
 
01:28:12.310 --> 01:28:12.320 align:start position:0%
participating in our public schools just
 
01:28:13.669 --> 01:28:13.679 align:start position:0%
as there are for other parts of our
 
01:28:16.149 --> 01:28:16.159 align:start position:0%
community where choice is not optional
 
01:28:17.750 --> 01:28:17.760 align:start position:0%
as an analogy i'd like to pause and
 
01:28:19.510 --> 01:28:19.520 align:start position:0%
think about our roads
 
01:28:21.510 --> 01:28:21.520 align:start position:0%
we have certain rules expectations and
 
01:28:23.590 --> 01:28:23.600 align:start position:0%
enforceable laws that reduce the risk on
 
01:28:26.709 --> 01:28:26.719 align:start position:0%
our state's roads one must have breaks
 
01:28:28.629 --> 01:28:28.639 align:start position:0%
you can choose your mechanic you can get
 
01:28:30.790 --> 01:28:30.800 align:start position:0%
another opinion or more
 
01:28:32.950 --> 01:28:32.960 align:start position:0%
you can do your own brake job if you
 
01:28:35.030 --> 01:28:35.040 align:start position:0%
know how no matter you must have your
 
01:28:37.510 --> 01:28:37.520 align:start position:0%
car inspected annually
 
01:28:39.990 --> 01:28:40.000 align:start position:0%
and or your car will be impounded
 
01:28:42.229 --> 01:28:42.239 align:start position:0%
you must have brakes a steering wheel
 
01:28:44.229 --> 01:28:44.239 align:start position:0%
windshield safe tires
 
01:28:45.669 --> 01:28:45.679 align:start position:0%
this is for your safety and for the
 
01:28:47.590 --> 01:28:47.600 align:start position:0%
safety of those around you do you need
 
01:28:49.990 --> 01:28:50.000 align:start position:0%
to have a car on brakes no you can ride
 
01:28:52.870 --> 01:28:52.880 align:start position:0%
a bike you can walk or some buggy
 
01:28:54.470 --> 01:28:54.480 align:start position:0%
but you have to have brakes if you drive
 
01:28:57.830 --> 01:28:57.840 align:start position:0%
a car you also cannot choose not to have
 
01:28:59.510 --> 01:28:59.520 align:start position:0%
the school bus have a brake job and you
 
01:29:01.590 --> 01:29:01.600 align:start position:0%
cannot as a taxpayer expect that you
 
01:29:03.510 --> 01:29:03.520 align:start position:0%
will do the brake job on the buses to
 
01:29:05.830 --> 01:29:05.840 align:start position:0%
save taxpayer money in addition while
 
01:29:07.590 --> 01:29:07.600 align:start position:0%
we're talking about brakes we know that
 
01:29:09.510 --> 01:29:09.520 align:start position:0%
brakes don't prevent all accidents but
 
01:29:11.350 --> 01:29:11.360 align:start position:0%
having functioning breaks reduces the
 
01:29:14.470 --> 01:29:14.480 align:start position:0%
likelihood of serious accidents
 
01:29:16.149 --> 01:29:16.159 align:start position:0%
using this analogy and the information
 
01:29:17.910 --> 01:29:17.920 align:start position:0%
on the rigorous evaluation of vaccines
 
01:29:19.669 --> 01:29:19.679 align:start position:0%
and their recommended schedule we'll get
 
01:29:21.590 --> 01:29:21.600 align:start position:0%
back to the subject of school vaccines
 
01:29:23.590 --> 01:29:23.600 align:start position:0%
and requirements like brakes on the car
 
01:29:25.350 --> 01:29:25.360 align:start position:0%
driving next to me on 101 on my way here
 
01:29:27.270 --> 01:29:27.280 align:start position:0%
today i expect that the students sitting
 
01:29:28.870 --> 01:29:28.880 align:start position:0%
in my son's class this morning with a
 
01:29:30.950 --> 01:29:30.960 align:start position:0%
student undergoing treatment for cancer
 
01:29:32.390 --> 01:29:32.400 align:start position:0%
are protected from contracting and
 
01:29:34.070 --> 01:29:34.080 align:start position:0%
passing an illness which might lead to
 
01:29:35.430 --> 01:29:35.440 align:start position:0%
his earlier death
 
01:29:37.350 --> 01:29:37.360 align:start position:0%
in my daughter's middle school class i
 
01:29:38.629 --> 01:29:38.639 align:start position:0%
expect that the students are preparing
 
01:29:40.470 --> 01:29:40.480 align:start position:0%
to babysit young children are protected
 
01:29:42.229 --> 01:29:42.239 align:start position:0%
from passing whooping cough
 
01:29:44.870 --> 01:29:44.880 align:start position:0%
on to their care
 
01:29:46.870 --> 01:29:46.880 align:start position:0%
and that uh
 
01:29:46.880 --> 01:29:47.990 align:start position:0%
and that uh
they

01:29:47.990 --> 01:29:48.000 align:start position:0%
they
 
01:29:49.350 --> 01:29:49.360 align:start position:0%
that those infants are protected from
 
01:29:51.430 --> 01:29:51.440 align:start position:0%
stopping breathing from whooping cough
 
01:29:52.709 --> 01:29:52.719 align:start position:0%
and dying
 
01:29:54.070 --> 01:29:54.080 align:start position:0%
i also hope that they're protected from
 
01:29:55.910 --> 01:29:55.920 align:start position:0%
dying themselves from the tetanus that
 
01:29:57.189 --> 01:29:57.199 align:start position:0%
they may contract while out in the
 
01:29:59.430 --> 01:29:59.440 align:start position:0%
schoolyard today working on their maps
 
01:30:00.470 --> 01:30:00.480 align:start position:0%
they're creating for their social
 
01:30:02.709 --> 01:30:02.719 align:start position:0%
studies class and i sincerely hope that
 
01:30:04.070 --> 01:30:04.080 align:start position:0%
the students in my husband's high school
 
01:30:05.510 --> 01:30:05.520 align:start position:0%
classes are protected from bacterial
 
01:30:07.110 --> 01:30:07.120 align:start position:0%
meningitis where you get plus around
 
01:30:08.709 --> 01:30:08.719 align:start position:0%
your brain and spinal cord
 
01:30:10.229 --> 01:30:10.239 align:start position:0%
or the and the possibility of passing
 
01:30:11.669 --> 01:30:11.679 align:start position:0%
that to one another doing their small
 
01:30:13.910 --> 01:30:13.920 align:start position:0%
group work on the bus to sporting
 
01:30:15.990 --> 01:30:16.000 align:start position:0%
competition and with their first kiss
 
01:30:18.070 --> 01:30:18.080 align:start position:0%
and i admit that maybe that's not true
 
01:30:19.669 --> 01:30:19.679 align:start position:0%
for everybody but my kids are not going
 
01:30:21.590 --> 01:30:21.600 align:start position:0%
to kiss anybody until high school
 
01:30:21.600 --> 01:30:22.390 align:start position:0%
to kiss anybody until high school
so

01:30:22.390 --> 01:30:22.400 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:30:23.590 --> 01:30:23.600 align:start position:0%
we've seen the failure of school
 
01:30:25.590 --> 01:30:25.600 align:start position:0%
requirements across the country
 
01:30:27.350 --> 01:30:27.360 align:start position:0%
with outbreaks of measles mumps
 
01:30:29.350 --> 01:30:29.360 align:start position:0%
pertussis or whooping cough and more
 
01:30:31.510 --> 01:30:31.520 align:start position:0%
kobe continues to teach us about the
 
01:30:33.830 --> 01:30:33.840 align:start position:0%
importance of school our peers our
 
01:30:36.149 --> 01:30:36.159 align:start position:0%
social emotional learning as well as the
 
01:30:37.830 --> 01:30:37.840 align:start position:0%
evolving science of viruses their
 
01:30:39.430 --> 01:30:39.440 align:start position:0%
treatment and prevention
 
01:30:40.709 --> 01:30:40.719 align:start position:0%
it remains a delicate balance of
 
01:30:43.110 --> 01:30:43.120 align:start position:0%
protecting ourselves from illness with
 
01:30:45.110 --> 01:30:45.120 align:start position:0%
vaccines masks and time away from school
 
01:30:47.189 --> 01:30:47.199 align:start position:0%
to recover from an illness with being an
 
01:30:48.390 --> 01:30:48.400 align:start position:0%
active participant in your school
 
01:30:50.310 --> 01:30:50.320 align:start position:0%
community learning the basics of our
 
01:30:52.229 --> 01:30:52.239 align:start position:0%
curriculum making friends learning
 
01:30:54.470 --> 01:30:54.480 align:start position:0%
independence and being active the
 
01:30:56.070 --> 01:30:56.080 align:start position:0%
american academy of pediatrics through
 
01:30:58.310 --> 01:30:58.320 align:start position:0%
its published book the red book actually
 
01:31:00.229 --> 01:31:00.239 align:start position:0%
what it's called
 
01:31:02.950 --> 01:31:02.960 align:start position:0%
uh of infectious diseases has guidelines
 
01:31:02.960 --> 01:31:03.910 align:start position:0%
uh of infectious diseases has guidelines
um

01:31:03.910 --> 01:31:03.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:31:03.920 --> 01:31:04.629 align:start position:0%
um
and

01:31:04.629 --> 01:31:04.639 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:31:06.950 --> 01:31:06.960 align:start position:0%
specifically for school health uh they
 
01:31:08.950 --> 01:31:08.960 align:start position:0%
have 10 pages dedicated to school
 
01:31:11.430 --> 01:31:11.440 align:start position:0%
re-entrance and infectious issues and
 
01:31:13.350 --> 01:31:13.360 align:start position:0%
management at school as well as another
 
01:31:16.550 --> 01:31:16.560 align:start position:0%
15 pages for out of home day daycare
 
01:31:18.470 --> 01:31:18.480 align:start position:0%
this group provides clear guidance
 
01:31:21.189 --> 01:31:21.199 align:start position:0%
around influenza whooping cough diarrhea
 
01:31:22.310 --> 01:31:22.320 align:start position:0%
and lice
 
01:31:24.470 --> 01:31:24.480 align:start position:0%
when you go home when you come back what
 
01:31:27.110 --> 01:31:27.120 align:start position:0%
classroom interventions are needed as we
 
01:31:28.390 --> 01:31:28.400 align:start position:0%
continue to see these clusters and
 
01:31:29.510 --> 01:31:29.520 align:start position:0%
outbreaks of
 
01:31:31.350 --> 01:31:31.360 align:start position:0%
infectious diseases in new hampshire we
 
01:31:32.870 --> 01:31:32.880 align:start position:0%
know that staying vigilant and listening
 
01:31:35.189 --> 01:31:35.199 align:start position:0%
to our trusted mechanics the infectious
 
01:31:39.510 --> 01:31:39.520 align:start position:0%
disease experts of the fda cdc acip aap
 
01:31:42.550 --> 01:31:42.560 align:start position:0%
aafp will do the best to keep us as safe
 
01:31:43.669 --> 01:31:43.679 align:start position:0%
and well as possible in the changing
 
01:31:45.270 --> 01:31:45.280 align:start position:0%
world of infections and of our
 
01:31:45.280 --> 01:31:46.550 align:start position:0%
world of infections and of our
communities

01:31:46.550 --> 01:31:46.560 align:start position:0%
communities
 
01:31:48.229 --> 01:31:48.239 align:start position:0%
and i provided here just two resources
 
01:31:50.709 --> 01:31:50.719 align:start position:0%
one the reference to the red book uh
 
01:31:52.470 --> 01:31:52.480 align:start position:0%
it's published every couple of years
 
01:31:54.470 --> 01:31:54.480 align:start position:0%
it's routinely updated
 
01:31:56.709 --> 01:31:56.719 align:start position:0%
on their website and those emails come
 
01:31:58.390 --> 01:31:58.400 align:start position:0%
out to practicing physicians
 
01:32:00.310 --> 01:32:00.320 align:start position:0%
specifically those who are fellows of
 
01:32:02.070 --> 01:32:02.080 align:start position:0%
the american academy of pediatrics but
 
01:32:04.470 --> 01:32:04.480 align:start position:0%
available to anybody online
 
01:32:07.270 --> 01:32:07.280 align:start position:0%
their next version version 32 is coming
 
01:32:09.110 --> 01:32:09.120 align:start position:0%
out this updated this coming year of
 
01:32:09.120 --> 01:32:10.790 align:start position:0%
out this updated this coming year of
2022.

01:32:10.790 --> 01:32:10.800 align:start position:0%
2022.
 
01:32:11.990 --> 01:32:12.000 align:start position:0%
i also referenced the children's
 
01:32:14.310 --> 01:32:14.320 align:start position:0%
hospital philadelphia website uh that's
 
01:32:17.110 --> 01:32:17.120 align:start position:0%
the chop.edu backslash vaccine
 
01:32:20.149 --> 01:32:20.159 align:start position:0%
it's a very uh well thought out
 
01:32:22.550 --> 01:32:22.560 align:start position:0%
reference for vaccines uh they provide
 
01:32:25.189 --> 01:32:25.199 align:start position:0%
the studies that they reference uh very
 
01:32:28.149 --> 01:32:28.159 align:start position:0%
nicely and really i think address a
 
01:32:29.990 --> 01:32:30.000 align:start position:0%
large variety of questions that come up
 
01:32:32.070 --> 01:32:32.080 align:start position:0%
around vaccines
 
01:32:33.830 --> 01:32:33.840 align:start position:0%
including you know why would you want to
 
01:32:35.110 --> 01:32:35.120 align:start position:0%
get vaccinated who shouldn't get
 
01:32:36.629 --> 01:32:36.639 align:start position:0%
vaccinated and i think it's about as
 
01:32:38.790 --> 01:32:38.800 align:start position:0%
unbiased as you'll find
 
01:32:41.030 --> 01:32:41.040 align:start position:0%
for a resource out there
 
01:32:42.790 --> 01:32:42.800 align:start position:0%
what i didn't include there but i wanted
 
01:32:44.870 --> 01:32:44.880 align:start position:0%
to just pull up on a screen here for you
 
01:32:46.390 --> 01:32:46.400 align:start position:0%
is just where we are with kovid right
 
01:32:47.910 --> 01:32:47.920 align:start position:0%
now uh
 
01:32:50.229 --> 01:32:50.239 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire for kids um i realize
 
01:32:51.590 --> 01:32:51.600 align:start position:0%
that's not the only reason we're here
 
01:32:53.910 --> 01:32:53.920 align:start position:0%
today uh but i do think it's important
 
01:32:56.550 --> 01:32:56.560 align:start position:0%
for us to just take a quick look and see
 
01:32:56.560 --> 01:32:57.590 align:start position:0%
for us to just take a quick look and see
why

01:32:57.590 --> 01:32:57.600 align:start position:0%
why
 
01:32:59.830 --> 01:32:59.840 align:start position:0%
my colleagues and i are tired and
 
01:33:02.470 --> 01:33:02.480 align:start position:0%
worried and why i'm here today
 
01:33:04.149 --> 01:33:04.159 align:start position:0%
this is just a screenshot from this
 
01:33:07.510 --> 01:33:07.520 align:start position:0%
morning on the new hampshire dashboard
 
01:33:09.430 --> 01:33:09.440 align:start position:0%
this is your overall trend i know it's
 
01:33:10.870 --> 01:33:10.880 align:start position:0%
kind of hard to see
 
01:33:13.110 --> 01:33:13.120 align:start position:0%
of covid cases for the whole population
 
01:33:14.709 --> 01:33:14.719 align:start position:0%
here in new hampshire and you can see
 
01:33:16.390 --> 01:33:16.400 align:start position:0%
that while we're certainly
 
01:33:18.070 --> 01:33:18.080 align:start position:0%
enduring a spike as we heard about
 
01:33:19.910 --> 01:33:19.920 align:start position:0%
earlier with delta
 
01:33:22.470 --> 01:33:22.480 align:start position:0%
it didn't rival where we were back in
 
01:33:24.470 --> 01:33:24.480 align:start position:0%
january uh december january february of
 
01:33:26.550 --> 01:33:26.560 align:start position:0%
last year but we're seeing in pediatrics
 
01:33:28.229 --> 01:33:28.239 align:start position:0%
is not that what we're seeing in
 
01:33:29.990 --> 01:33:30.000 align:start position:0%
pediatrics right now
 
01:33:32.950 --> 01:33:32.960 align:start position:0%
is a doubling of the highest rate we've
 
01:33:35.510 --> 01:33:35.520 align:start position:0%
ever seen of covid here this is
 
01:33:38.310 --> 01:33:38.320 align:start position:0%
specifically kids uh zero to ten uh
 
01:33:41.350 --> 01:33:41.360 align:start position:0%
these have been until yesterday uh kids
 
01:33:43.750 --> 01:33:43.760 align:start position:0%
that did not qualify for vaccination and
 
01:33:46.709 --> 01:33:46.719 align:start position:0%
you can see that while we were doing a
 
01:33:48.950 --> 01:33:48.960 align:start position:0%
lot of interventions back here in terms
 
01:33:52.550 --> 01:33:52.560 align:start position:0%
of modifications of schooling et cetera
 
01:33:54.229 --> 01:33:54.239 align:start position:0%
being back in place even with those
 
01:33:56.629 --> 01:33:56.639 align:start position:0%
modifications we're seeing a huge surge
 
01:33:58.390 --> 01:33:58.400 align:start position:0%
and so this is really pertinent this is
 
01:33:58.400 --> 01:33:59.910 align:start position:0%
and so this is really pertinent this is
why

01:33:59.910 --> 01:33:59.920 align:start position:0%
why
 
01:34:01.830 --> 01:34:01.840 align:start position:0%
i'm up at night this is why i got up at
 
01:34:03.510 --> 01:34:03.520 align:start position:0%
three o'clock in the morning yesterday
 
01:34:05.189 --> 01:34:05.199 align:start position:0%
to sign my kids up for a vaccine since
 
01:34:06.950 --> 01:34:06.960 align:start position:0%
they now qualify
 
01:34:09.990 --> 01:34:10.000 align:start position:0%
this is why my practice is seeing over
 
01:34:13.350 --> 01:34:13.360 align:start position:0%
125 of what we usually see in our office
 
01:34:14.870 --> 01:34:14.880 align:start position:0%
this is why parents are missing work
 
01:34:17.110 --> 01:34:17.120 align:start position:0%
this is why kids are missing school
 
01:34:19.510 --> 01:34:19.520 align:start position:0%
and this is an example of why these
 
01:34:21.350 --> 01:34:21.360 align:start position:0%
other components of health care i think
 
01:34:23.510 --> 01:34:23.520 align:start position:0%
are super important for our children in
 
01:34:25.430 --> 01:34:25.440 align:start position:0%
the school settings so i hope that's
 
01:34:26.470 --> 01:34:26.480 align:start position:0%
helpful i know this is a little out of
 
01:34:27.910 --> 01:34:27.920 align:start position:0%
my comfort zone but i'm happy to try to
 
01:34:31.350 --> 01:34:31.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:33.110 --> 01:34:33.120 align:start position:0%
thank you doctor i'm going to jump in
 
01:34:35.510 --> 01:34:35.520 align:start position:0%
first here so um i appreciate your
 
01:34:37.030 --> 01:34:37.040 align:start position:0%
testimony i'm going to switch the
 
01:34:38.310 --> 01:34:38.320 align:start position:0%
conversation up just a little bit and
 
01:34:40.229 --> 01:34:40.239 align:start position:0%
not talk so much about vaccines as
 
01:34:42.390 --> 01:34:42.400 align:start position:0%
talked about health care in general um
 
01:34:44.149 --> 01:34:44.159 align:start position:0%
yesterday we had a conversation with the
 
01:34:46.470 --> 01:34:46.480 align:start position:0%
attorney general regarding informed
 
01:34:49.270 --> 01:34:49.280 align:start position:0%
consent and consent and so and we also
 
01:34:50.950 --> 01:34:50.960 align:start position:0%
had uh department health and human
 
01:34:52.390 --> 01:34:52.400 align:start position:0%
services here talk about informed
 
01:34:52.400 --> 01:34:53.430 align:start position:0%
services here talk about informed
consent

01:34:53.430 --> 01:34:53.440 align:start position:0%
consent
 
01:34:55.669 --> 01:34:55.679 align:start position:0%
and so it's my understanding you know
 
01:34:58.070 --> 01:34:58.080 align:start position:0%
the attorney the attorney general's
 
01:34:59.750 --> 01:34:59.760 align:start position:0%
you know made it clear that informed
 
01:35:01.669 --> 01:35:01.679 align:start position:0%
consent has to be free and voluntary
 
01:35:03.750 --> 01:35:03.760 align:start position:0%
right and that and that kind of the
 
01:35:05.350 --> 01:35:05.360 align:start position:0%
definition of consent right free and
 
01:35:05.360 --> 01:35:06.550 align:start position:0%
definition of consent right free and
voluntary

01:35:06.550 --> 01:35:06.560 align:start position:0%
voluntary
 
01:35:09.750 --> 01:35:09.760 align:start position:0%
um and so my my concern is is around the
 
01:35:11.590 --> 01:35:11.600 align:start position:0%
free and voluntary nature of informed
 
01:35:13.669 --> 01:35:13.679 align:start position:0%
consent relative to the vaccine and so
 
01:35:15.430 --> 01:35:15.440 align:start position:0%
i'm going to pose a hypothetical to you
 
01:35:17.030 --> 01:35:17.040 align:start position:0%
and ask a question
 
01:35:19.669 --> 01:35:19.679 align:start position:0%
and and see if i can see if we can put
 
01:35:20.870 --> 01:35:20.880 align:start position:0%
this in terms that everybody can
 
01:35:20.880 --> 01:35:22.310 align:start position:0%
this in terms that everybody can
understand

01:35:22.310 --> 01:35:22.320 align:start position:0%
understand
 
01:35:22.320 --> 01:35:23.109 align:start position:0%
understand
so

01:35:23.109 --> 01:35:23.119 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:35:25.109 --> 01:35:25.119 align:start position:0%
if a woman walked into the doctor's
 
01:35:27.510 --> 01:35:27.520 align:start position:0%
office and asked for an abortion
 
01:35:28.870 --> 01:35:28.880 align:start position:0%
and when the doctor through his
 
01:35:30.229 --> 01:35:30.239 align:start position:0%
conversation found out the reason a
 
01:35:31.430 --> 01:35:31.440 align:start position:0%
woman wanted the abortion is because the
 
01:35:32.470 --> 01:35:32.480 align:start position:0%
husband said that he was going to
 
01:35:34.070 --> 01:35:34.080 align:start position:0%
divorce her if she didn't get an
 
01:35:34.080 --> 01:35:36.470 align:start position:0%
divorce her if she didn't get an
abortion

01:35:36.470 --> 01:35:36.480 align:start position:0%
abortion
 
01:35:37.990 --> 01:35:38.000 align:start position:0%
under informed consent and general
 
01:35:40.550 --> 01:35:40.560 align:start position:0%
medical practitioner would you would a
 
01:35:43.030 --> 01:35:43.040 align:start position:0%
doctor be ethically correct in giving
 
01:35:44.310 --> 01:35:44.320 align:start position:0%
that abortion if that was the only
 
01:35:45.830 --> 01:35:45.840 align:start position:0%
reason the woman wanted the abortion she
 
01:35:47.430 --> 01:35:47.440 align:start position:0%
wanted the child but her husband was
 
01:35:48.709 --> 01:35:48.719 align:start position:0%
going to divorce her take her home take
 
01:35:50.390 --> 01:35:50.400 align:start position:0%
her house you know all those fears and
 
01:35:52.709 --> 01:35:52.719 align:start position:0%
threats that go along with that
 
01:35:54.149 --> 01:35:54.159 align:start position:0%
and that's why she wanted the abortion
 
01:35:55.430 --> 01:35:55.440 align:start position:0%
not because she actually wanted the
 
01:35:57.109 --> 01:35:57.119 align:start position:0%
abortion would the doctor be ethically
 
01:35:59.189 --> 01:35:59.199 align:start position:0%
correct in performing the abortion
 
01:36:00.709 --> 01:36:00.719 align:start position:0%
so that's a really challenging question
 
01:36:02.149 --> 01:36:02.159 align:start position:0%
for me to answer because it's not one
 
01:36:04.229 --> 01:36:04.239 align:start position:0%
that i've particularly had to go through
 
01:36:06.310 --> 01:36:06.320 align:start position:0%
as a pediatrician who does not provide
 
01:36:06.320 --> 01:36:07.669 align:start position:0%
as a pediatrician who does not provide
abortions

01:36:07.669 --> 01:36:07.679 align:start position:0%
abortions
 
01:36:10.390 --> 01:36:10.400 align:start position:0%
the consent that i do in my office
 
01:36:13.430 --> 01:36:13.440 align:start position:0%
for patients under 18 and balls ascent
 
01:36:16.149 --> 01:36:16.159 align:start position:0%
from the patient as well as informed
 
01:36:18.470 --> 01:36:18.480 align:start position:0%
consent from the parent
 
01:36:20.470 --> 01:36:20.480 align:start position:0%
and then certainly for patients over 18
 
01:36:22.790 --> 01:36:22.800 align:start position:0%
they are able to do their own consenting
 
01:36:23.669 --> 01:36:23.679 align:start position:0%
as well
 
01:36:25.510 --> 01:36:25.520 align:start position:0%
but in terms of having those complicated
 
01:36:27.669 --> 01:36:27.679 align:start position:0%
conversations around abortion that is
 
01:36:29.510 --> 01:36:29.520 align:start position:0%
not something that i have spent a lot of
 
01:36:31.270 --> 01:36:31.280 align:start position:0%
time thinking about uh in my active
 
01:36:32.709 --> 01:36:32.719 align:start position:0%
practice because of the pediatrician
 
01:36:34.790 --> 01:36:34.800 align:start position:0%
that's not part of my purview
 
01:36:36.470 --> 01:36:36.480 align:start position:0%
well again i'm not really talking about
 
01:36:38.550 --> 01:36:38.560 align:start position:0%
the abortion talking about the decision
 
01:36:40.229 --> 01:36:40.239 align:start position:0%
right to act right so again we're
 
01:36:41.830 --> 01:36:41.840 align:start position:0%
talking about the physician making an
 
01:36:44.149 --> 01:36:44.159 align:start position:0%
ethical decision on is should i go ahead
 
01:36:46.149 --> 01:36:46.159 align:start position:0%
with this procedure or should i not
 
01:36:47.669 --> 01:36:47.679 align:start position:0%
um and the question is involving
 
01:36:49.430 --> 01:36:49.440 align:start position:0%
informed consent is that a voluntary
 
01:36:51.430 --> 01:36:51.440 align:start position:0%
free informed consent to do the
 
01:36:54.149 --> 01:36:54.159 align:start position:0%
procedure when there's a coercion on the
 
01:36:55.510 --> 01:36:55.520 align:start position:0%
back end right there's a there's a
 
01:36:56.790 --> 01:36:56.800 align:start position:0%
threat of divorce and the threat it's
 
01:36:58.149 --> 01:36:58.159 align:start position:0%
not necessarily what the patient wants
 
01:37:00.229 --> 01:37:00.239 align:start position:0%
but it's what the what the husband wants
 
01:37:01.830 --> 01:37:01.840 align:start position:0%
in this case now as you can see where
 
01:37:02.790 --> 01:37:02.800 align:start position:0%
i'm going with this all right we're
 
01:37:04.149 --> 01:37:04.159 align:start position:0%
talking about vaccinations right so
 
01:37:05.669 --> 01:37:05.679 align:start position:0%
there's a mandate and a federal mandate
 
01:37:06.390 --> 01:37:06.400 align:start position:0%
out there
 
01:37:08.149 --> 01:37:08.159 align:start position:0%
um either in executive orders and
 
01:37:10.310 --> 01:37:10.320 align:start position:0%
there's also soon to be an osha
 
01:37:13.030 --> 01:37:13.040 align:start position:0%
regulation that requires people and the
 
01:37:14.870 --> 01:37:14.880 align:start position:0%
threat the threat behind that is firing
 
01:37:16.310 --> 01:37:16.320 align:start position:0%
right so if you don't get it you can you
 
01:37:18.070 --> 01:37:18.080 align:start position:0%
can't work here anymore and you're gonna
 
01:37:19.510 --> 01:37:19.520 align:start position:0%
potentially lose your house not be able
 
01:37:21.990 --> 01:37:22.000 align:start position:0%
to food on your family so the
 
01:37:24.790 --> 01:37:24.800 align:start position:0%
the employee comes in reluctantly not
 
01:37:26.470 --> 01:37:26.480 align:start position:0%
wanting the vaccine but being kind of
 
01:37:28.870 --> 01:37:28.880 align:start position:0%
forced into this situation of having to
 
01:37:30.470 --> 01:37:30.480 align:start position:0%
get it in order to maintain their
 
01:37:32.470 --> 01:37:32.480 align:start position:0%
livelihood right and put food on their
 
01:37:35.109 --> 01:37:35.119 align:start position:0%
family on their table for their family
 
01:37:37.510 --> 01:37:37.520 align:start position:0%
is there a informed consent issue there
 
01:37:39.109 --> 01:37:39.119 align:start position:0%
right that the doctors knowing this we
 
01:37:40.310 --> 01:37:40.320 align:start position:0%
should be asking right do you really
 
01:37:41.830 --> 01:37:41.840 align:start position:0%
want to get this or is this because of a
 
01:37:43.830 --> 01:37:43.840 align:start position:0%
work requirement right is that a
 
01:37:45.510 --> 01:37:45.520 align:start position:0%
question we should be asking and finding
 
01:37:47.350 --> 01:37:47.360 align:start position:0%
out whether this is a free and voluntary
 
01:37:49.590 --> 01:37:49.600 align:start position:0%
consent or coerced and threatened
 
01:37:49.600 --> 01:37:53.109 align:start position:0%
consent or coerced and threatened
consent

01:37:53.109 --> 01:37:53.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:54.870 --> 01:37:54.880 align:start position:0%
again i may not be just the right person
 
01:37:57.350 --> 01:37:57.360 align:start position:0%
to talk to because of the position that
 
01:37:59.270 --> 01:37:59.280 align:start position:0%
i'm in as a pediatrician
 
01:38:02.390 --> 01:38:02.400 align:start position:0%
my patient population is up to age 22 so
 
01:38:04.470 --> 01:38:04.480 align:start position:0%
a mandate for work would not
 
01:38:07.270 --> 01:38:07.280 align:start position:0%
particularly impact most of my patients
 
01:38:08.870 --> 01:38:08.880 align:start position:0%
because most of my patients are not
 
01:38:10.870 --> 01:38:10.880 align:start position:0%
employed they are typically students or
 
01:38:12.709 --> 01:38:12.719 align:start position:0%
at home with their families
 
01:38:14.629 --> 01:38:14.639 align:start position:0%
i whenever we do
 
01:38:17.430 --> 01:38:17.440 align:start position:0%
informed consent around any uh
 
01:38:19.750 --> 01:38:19.760 align:start position:0%
any procedure any medication or
 
01:38:19.760 --> 01:38:20.709 align:start position:0%
any procedure any medication or
treatment

01:38:20.709 --> 01:38:20.719 align:start position:0%
treatment
 
01:38:22.229 --> 01:38:22.239 align:start position:0%
we certainly want to go through and have
 
01:38:24.470 --> 01:38:24.480 align:start position:0%
that thorough conversation to make sure
 
01:38:24.480 --> 01:38:25.270 align:start position:0%
that thorough conversation to make sure
that

01:38:25.270 --> 01:38:25.280 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:38:27.350 --> 01:38:27.360 align:start position:0%
we are not feeling uncomfortable that
 
01:38:29.189 --> 01:38:29.199 align:start position:0%
that person is under
 
01:38:32.790 --> 01:38:32.800 align:start position:0%
uh undue pressure uh for that
 
01:38:34.790 --> 01:38:34.800 align:start position:0%
but that certainly from my perspective
 
01:38:37.590 --> 01:38:37.600 align:start position:0%
has more to do with a case-by-case
 
01:38:40.629 --> 01:38:40.639 align:start position:0%
scenario where you really have to
 
01:38:43.510 --> 01:38:43.520 align:start position:0%
pull that out from somebody is that
 
01:38:45.030 --> 01:38:45.040 align:start position:0%
as that person
 
01:38:47.030 --> 01:38:47.040 align:start position:0%
thought of that uh all those
 
01:38:49.030 --> 01:38:49.040 align:start position:0%
conversations that you just had
 
01:38:50.950 --> 01:38:50.960 align:start position:0%
we really want to make sure that you
 
01:38:53.750 --> 01:38:53.760 align:start position:0%
have autonomy um in your decision making
 
01:38:56.070 --> 01:38:56.080 align:start position:0%
um an informed decision uh when you make
 
01:38:59.750 --> 01:38:59.760 align:start position:0%
that decision but ultimately those
 
01:39:01.910 --> 01:39:01.920 align:start position:0%
those those final decisions are
 
01:39:03.830 --> 01:39:03.840 align:start position:0%
something that is made
 
01:39:05.590 --> 01:39:05.600 align:start position:0%
in that relationship to feel comfortable
 
01:39:08.709 --> 01:39:08.719 align:start position:0%
that that is a truly informed consent
 
01:39:10.070 --> 01:39:10.080 align:start position:0%
so maybe there's a question for the
 
01:39:11.669 --> 01:39:11.679 align:start position:0%
medical society again i'm more concerned
 
01:39:13.510 --> 01:39:13.520 align:start position:0%
about putting doctors in an untenable
 
01:39:13.520 --> 01:39:14.709 align:start position:0%
about putting doctors in an untenable
situation

01:39:14.709 --> 01:39:14.719 align:start position:0%
situation
 
01:39:16.550 --> 01:39:16.560 align:start position:0%
right where they're they're
 
01:39:19.750 --> 01:39:19.760 align:start position:0%
they're giving you know giving vaccines
 
01:39:21.510 --> 01:39:21.520 align:start position:0%
you know to people that are don't
 
01:39:23.750 --> 01:39:23.760 align:start position:0%
necessarily are giving free free consent
 
01:39:25.270 --> 01:39:25.280 align:start position:0%
they're giving coerce consent because
 
01:39:26.709 --> 01:39:26.719 align:start position:0%
they have to for their job function are
 
01:39:28.870 --> 01:39:28.880 align:start position:0%
we putting these doctors at risk weapons
 
01:39:30.310 --> 01:39:30.320 align:start position:0%
if a doctor says okay when that's the
 
01:39:31.590 --> 01:39:31.600 align:start position:0%
case i'm going to say no i'm not going
 
01:39:32.870 --> 01:39:32.880 align:start position:0%
to give it to you and then what that
 
01:39:34.950 --> 01:39:34.960 align:start position:0%
what does that do to the employee when
 
01:39:36.390 --> 01:39:36.400 align:start position:0%
the doctor's not doing them i want to
 
01:39:38.470 --> 01:39:38.480 align:start position:0%
put doctors in ethical situations where
 
01:39:40.550 --> 01:39:40.560 align:start position:0%
we have problems where again there's a
 
01:39:42.470 --> 01:39:42.480 align:start position:0%
coerced and threatened
 
01:39:43.910 --> 01:39:43.920 align:start position:0%
you know of livelihood right making
 
01:39:46.070 --> 01:39:46.080 align:start position:0%
money available food on my table versus
 
01:39:47.910 --> 01:39:47.920 align:start position:0%
i know i just i believe in a vaccine and
 
01:39:48.950 --> 01:39:48.960 align:start position:0%
i'm not making a statement about the
 
01:39:50.470 --> 01:39:50.480 align:start position:0%
vaccine at all i'm just talking about
 
01:39:52.790 --> 01:39:52.800 align:start position:0%
the the ethical obligation of a doctor
 
01:39:54.950 --> 01:39:54.960 align:start position:0%
right to make sure that the consent's
 
01:39:56.950 --> 01:39:56.960 align:start position:0%
free and you know free from threat or
 
01:39:56.960 --> 01:39:58.550 align:start position:0%
free and you know free from threat or
coercion

01:39:58.550 --> 01:39:58.560 align:start position:0%
coercion
 
01:40:00.310 --> 01:40:00.320 align:start position:0%
uh it's something that we'll certainly
 
01:40:01.990 --> 01:40:02.000 align:start position:0%
uh have larger discussions about with
 
01:40:04.390 --> 01:40:04.400 align:start position:0%
our um our leadership uh i think one of
 
01:40:05.750 --> 01:40:05.760 align:start position:0%
the things that i would go back to is
 
01:40:07.350 --> 01:40:07.360 align:start position:0%
that you know if these are regulations
 
01:40:09.030 --> 01:40:09.040 align:start position:0%
that are being put forth by certain
 
01:40:11.030 --> 01:40:11.040 align:start position:0%
employers um at the end of the day that
 
01:40:13.270 --> 01:40:13.280 align:start position:0%
is a decision that that individual
 
01:40:15.270 --> 01:40:15.280 align:start position:0%
uh can make and they can certainly go to
 
01:40:16.550 --> 01:40:16.560 align:start position:0%
their provider and they can discuss that
 
01:40:18.229 --> 01:40:18.239 align:start position:0%
with them and then it's up to them to
 
01:40:22.550 --> 01:40:22.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:24.790 --> 01:40:24.800 align:start position:0%
like again i'm also like i guess the
 
01:40:26.550 --> 01:40:26.560 align:start position:0%
point was i'm worried about the ethical
 
01:40:27.910 --> 01:40:27.920 align:start position:0%
problems of the doctors and then whether
 
01:40:29.350 --> 01:40:29.360 align:start position:0%
or not we're just putting in throwing
 
01:40:30.870 --> 01:40:30.880 align:start position:0%
away informed consent at all and just
 
01:40:33.350 --> 01:40:33.360 align:start position:0%
say no you have to do it do it and and
 
01:40:34.790 --> 01:40:34.800 align:start position:0%
those kind of concerns
 
01:40:38.070 --> 01:40:38.080 align:start position:0%
other questions jeff
 
01:40:40.149 --> 01:40:40.159 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair i i think i'm not
 
01:40:41.510 --> 01:40:41.520 align:start position:0%
sure whether it's a question or a
 
01:40:42.950 --> 01:40:42.960 align:start position:0%
comment um
 
01:40:44.629 --> 01:40:44.639 align:start position:0%
i think we've addressed part of this
 
01:40:46.550 --> 01:40:46.560 align:start position:0%
before that there are places of
 
01:40:48.149 --> 01:40:48.159 align:start position:0%
employment out there that currently
 
01:40:48.159 --> 01:40:49.590 align:start position:0%
employment out there that currently
require

01:40:49.590 --> 01:40:49.600 align:start position:0%
require
 
01:40:51.590 --> 01:40:51.600 align:start position:0%
vaccinations whether it be a flu
 
01:40:53.750 --> 01:40:53.760 align:start position:0%
vaccination a tetanus shot
 
01:40:56.709 --> 01:40:56.719 align:start position:0%
or any other form of medical care for
 
01:40:56.719 --> 01:40:57.910 align:start position:0%
or any other form of medical care for
employment

01:40:57.910 --> 01:40:57.920 align:start position:0%
employment
 
01:41:00.070 --> 01:41:00.080 align:start position:0%
and i'm not sure how this is any
 
01:41:01.910 --> 01:41:01.920 align:start position:0%
different or how this would be coercion
 
01:41:05.990 --> 01:41:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:07.189 --> 01:41:07.199 align:start position:0%
i'm going to step you guys out for a
 
01:41:09.189 --> 01:41:09.199 align:start position:0%
second so i can answer back so again i
 
01:41:11.350 --> 01:41:11.360 align:start position:0%
think it's the broad nature of of the
 
01:41:13.270 --> 01:41:13.280 align:start position:0%
mandate that's causing the issue right
 
01:41:14.310 --> 01:41:14.320 align:start position:0%
so again
 
01:41:19.030 --> 01:41:19.040 align:start position:0%
up until now those those uh mandates by
 
01:41:21.109 --> 01:41:21.119 align:start position:0%
individual employers where we were at
 
01:41:22.709 --> 01:41:22.719 align:start position:0%
the request of those employers and not
 
01:41:24.870 --> 01:41:24.880 align:start position:0%
every employer did a mandate
 
01:41:27.189 --> 01:41:27.199 align:start position:0%
but now we're hearing that 100 of
 
01:41:30.390 --> 01:41:30.400 align:start position:0%
anybody who has 101 employees
 
01:41:32.629 --> 01:41:32.639 align:start position:0%
have to do a mandate right so that can
 
01:41:34.470 --> 01:41:34.480 align:start position:0%
severely limits job function right the
 
01:41:36.709 --> 01:41:36.719 align:start position:0%
ability for citizens to go get jobs
 
01:41:39.830 --> 01:41:39.840 align:start position:0%
right in the case of the of the federal
 
01:41:42.070 --> 01:41:42.080 align:start position:0%
executive order um
 
01:41:44.229 --> 01:41:44.239 align:start position:0%
they're threatening medicare medicaid
 
01:41:46.390 --> 01:41:46.400 align:start position:0%
money for hospitals right so again or a
 
01:41:48.470 --> 01:41:48.480 align:start position:0%
hospital might be
 
01:41:48.480 --> 01:41:49.750 align:start position:0%
hospital might be
more

01:41:49.750 --> 01:41:49.760 align:start position:0%
more
 
01:41:51.990 --> 01:41:52.000 align:start position:0%
accommodating now they're no longer more
 
01:41:53.109 --> 01:41:53.119 align:start position:0%
accommodating because now we have
 
01:41:54.550 --> 01:41:54.560 align:start position:0%
significant amount of money in the case
 
01:41:56.149 --> 01:41:56.159 align:start position:0%
of dartmouth college multi-millions
 
01:41:58.470 --> 01:41:58.480 align:start position:0%
dollars worth of federal money would be
 
01:42:00.870 --> 01:42:00.880 align:start position:0%
impacted if they don't implement the
 
01:42:03.669 --> 01:42:03.679 align:start position:0%
broad forced mandate right so i think
 
01:42:05.030 --> 01:42:05.040 align:start position:0%
that the difference is that in our
 
01:42:07.030 --> 01:42:07.040 align:start position:0%
workforce environment is that we're
 
01:42:08.390 --> 01:42:08.400 align:start position:0%
actually now starting to limit where
 
01:42:10.229 --> 01:42:10.239 align:start position:0%
people can go work because of this
 
01:42:12.070 --> 01:42:12.080 align:start position:0%
mandate right where before there was
 
01:42:13.990 --> 01:42:14.000 align:start position:0%
more not every every employee did it
 
01:42:16.470 --> 01:42:16.480 align:start position:0%
employer did it and now even if you're
 
01:42:17.990 --> 01:42:18.000 align:start position:0%
under 101 and you're a federal
 
01:42:20.709 --> 01:42:20.719 align:start position:0%
contractor so um you know some small
 
01:42:21.990 --> 01:42:22.000 align:start position:0%
manufacturing companies up in the lakes
 
01:42:23.430 --> 01:42:23.440 align:start position:0%
region right you know i got phone calls
 
01:42:24.550 --> 01:42:24.560 align:start position:0%
from that were concerned about the
 
01:42:25.990 --> 01:42:26.000 align:start position:0%
mandate right they don't want to
 
01:42:27.189 --> 01:42:27.199 align:start position:0%
implement them but they're being forced
 
01:42:28.310 --> 01:42:28.320 align:start position:0%
to because they have federal contracts
 
01:42:29.910 --> 01:42:29.920 align:start position:0%
and it's a significant portion of their
 
01:42:32.310 --> 01:42:32.320 align:start position:0%
of their income so now employers who
 
01:42:34.149 --> 01:42:34.159 align:start position:0%
before had options to say no we're not
 
01:42:35.830 --> 01:42:35.840 align:start position:0%
going to do this are no longer given
 
01:42:38.709 --> 01:42:38.719 align:start position:0%
options and so now employees can't go to
 
01:42:40.629 --> 01:42:40.639 align:start position:0%
another manufacturer within lakes region
 
01:42:41.990 --> 01:42:42.000 align:start position:0%
to do something so i think it's the
 
01:42:44.470 --> 01:42:44.480 align:start position:0%
nature of the broad aspect of the
 
01:42:44.480 --> 01:42:45.910 align:start position:0%
nature of the broad aspect of the
mandate

01:42:45.910 --> 01:42:45.920 align:start position:0%
mandate
 
01:42:47.830 --> 01:42:47.840 align:start position:0%
and the fact that it's limiting people's
 
01:42:50.310 --> 01:42:50.320 align:start position:0%
ability to move from job to job because
 
01:42:51.830 --> 01:42:51.840 align:start position:0%
everyone's requiring it because of a
 
01:42:53.669 --> 01:42:53.679 align:start position:0%
federal requirement or federal mandate
 
01:42:55.750 --> 01:42:55.760 align:start position:0%
so i think that impacts citiz our
 
01:42:57.189 --> 01:42:57.199 align:start position:0%
citizenry right
 
01:42:59.350 --> 01:42:59.360 align:start position:0%
that's why it's conversation right
 
01:43:00.390 --> 01:43:00.400 align:start position:0%
that's why we're having these
 
01:43:03.510 --> 01:43:03.520 align:start position:0%
discussions is because i can't go from
 
01:43:05.990 --> 01:43:06.000 align:start position:0%
oncology to podiatry that may not
 
01:43:07.590 --> 01:43:07.600 align:start position:0%
require the vaccine because now
 
01:43:09.990 --> 01:43:10.000 align:start position:0%
everybody requires the vaccine due to a
 
01:43:12.229 --> 01:43:12.239 align:start position:0%
federal mandate and so that that's
 
01:43:13.910 --> 01:43:13.920 align:start position:0%
concerning that we're limiting our
 
01:43:17.270 --> 01:43:17.280 align:start position:0%
ability for our citizenry to to pursue
 
01:43:19.510 --> 01:43:19.520 align:start position:0%
their their life's passion their life's
 
01:43:21.430 --> 01:43:21.440 align:start position:0%
work that's all i think that's why we're
 
01:43:22.709 --> 01:43:22.719 align:start position:0%
having this conversation i think that's
 
01:43:25.109 --> 01:43:25.119 align:start position:0%
why consent is important is because we
 
01:43:27.030 --> 01:43:27.040 align:start position:0%
are limiting where people can go by
 
01:43:29.830 --> 01:43:29.840 align:start position:0%
these mandates um because it's so broad
 
01:43:33.669 --> 01:43:33.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:36.550 --> 01:43:36.560 align:start position:0%
good feel free to respond if it just may
 
01:43:36.560 --> 01:43:37.430 align:start position:0%
good feel free to respond if it just may
it's

01:43:37.430 --> 01:43:37.440 align:start position:0%
it's
 
01:43:40.229 --> 01:43:40.239 align:start position:0%
healthcare already requires flu vaccines
 
01:43:42.310 --> 01:43:42.320 align:start position:0%
we've heard from numerous hospitals
 
01:43:42.320 --> 01:43:43.109 align:start position:0%
we've heard from numerous hospitals
so

01:43:43.109 --> 01:43:43.119 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:43:44.470 --> 01:43:44.480 align:start position:0%
that limits
 
01:43:46.790 --> 01:43:46.800 align:start position:0%
a nurse or a doctor or healthcare worker
 
01:43:49.109 --> 01:43:49.119 align:start position:0%
into getting a flu vaccine yearly if
 
01:43:50.310 --> 01:43:50.320 align:start position:0%
they want to participate in that
 
01:43:52.870 --> 01:43:52.880 align:start position:0%
workforce and i'm not sure how they
 
01:43:52.880 --> 01:43:54.149 align:start position:0%
workforce and i'm not sure how they
differentiate

01:43:54.149 --> 01:43:54.159 align:start position:0%
differentiate
 
01:43:57.750 --> 01:43:57.760 align:start position:0%
where you're going with this as to that
 
01:43:59.510 --> 01:43:59.520 align:start position:0%
and whether you're in a profession that
 
01:44:01.910 --> 01:44:01.920 align:start position:0%
requires something or not
 
01:44:03.910 --> 01:44:03.920 align:start position:0%
it's it's it's similar are they being
 
01:44:05.270 --> 01:44:05.280 align:start position:0%
coerced because they can't go anywhere
 
01:44:05.280 --> 01:44:07.350 align:start position:0%
coerced because they can't go anywhere
else

01:44:07.350 --> 01:44:07.360 align:start position:0%
else
 
01:44:10.229 --> 01:44:10.239 align:start position:0%
so again not every every i guess and
 
01:44:11.750 --> 01:44:11.760 align:start position:0%
maybe the new hampshire society can can
 
01:44:13.669 --> 01:44:13.679 align:start position:0%
answer to this but again not every
 
01:44:16.550 --> 01:44:16.560 align:start position:0%
medical office required but now if
 
01:44:18.149 --> 01:44:18.159 align:start position:0%
they're taking medicare medicaid money
 
01:44:19.270 --> 01:44:19.280 align:start position:0%
they must
 
01:44:20.870 --> 01:44:20.880 align:start position:0%
right so again i could have found a
 
01:44:22.470 --> 01:44:22.480 align:start position:0%
doctor that says i'm not going to do the
 
01:44:22.480 --> 01:44:23.669 align:start position:0%
doctor that says i'm not going to do the
requirement

01:44:23.669 --> 01:44:23.679 align:start position:0%
requirement
 
01:44:25.430 --> 01:44:25.440 align:start position:0%
right but now we're putting a financial
 
01:44:27.350 --> 01:44:27.360 align:start position:0%
stress on those doctor's office if they
 
01:44:28.709 --> 01:44:28.719 align:start position:0%
don't do a financial requirement so it's
 
01:44:31.270 --> 01:44:31.280 align:start position:0%
a thumb on the scale issue right so the
 
01:44:32.550 --> 01:44:32.560 align:start position:0%
federal government's put a thumb on the
 
01:44:33.830 --> 01:44:33.840 align:start position:0%
scale and so where there might have been
 
01:44:35.590 --> 01:44:35.600 align:start position:0%
safe havens for people who wanted to go
 
01:44:38.629 --> 01:44:38.639 align:start position:0%
work in hospitals or places that
 
01:44:41.189 --> 01:44:41.199 align:start position:0%
performed regular everyday you know
 
01:44:43.350 --> 01:44:43.360 align:start position:0%
medicare medical work
 
01:44:45.830 --> 01:44:45.840 align:start position:0%
those are going away and i think that's
 
01:44:48.229 --> 01:44:48.239 align:start position:0%
the conversation point right is is that
 
01:44:50.390 --> 01:44:50.400 align:start position:0%
there are no safe harbors anymore right
 
01:44:52.390 --> 01:44:52.400 align:start position:0%
if i a doctor has to be willing to give
 
01:44:53.510 --> 01:44:53.520 align:start position:0%
up money
 
01:44:55.350 --> 01:44:55.360 align:start position:0%
in order just not to
 
01:44:57.990 --> 01:44:58.000 align:start position:0%
um require the vaccine and i'm not even
 
01:44:59.590 --> 01:44:59.600 align:start position:0%
sure that he can do that
 
01:45:01.510 --> 01:45:01.520 align:start position:0%
without potentially having losing his
 
01:45:01.520 --> 01:45:02.390 align:start position:0%
without potentially having losing his
license

01:45:02.390 --> 01:45:02.400 align:start position:0%
license
 
01:45:04.629 --> 01:45:04.639 align:start position:0%
right and so again it's the overreaching
 
01:45:07.669 --> 01:45:07.679 align:start position:0%
mandate that causes these discussions um
 
01:45:09.669 --> 01:45:09.679 align:start position:0%
and the fact that i agree with you if in
 
01:45:11.590 --> 01:45:11.600 align:start position:0%
a given situation it was hospital by
 
01:45:13.189 --> 01:45:13.199 align:start position:0%
hospital choice
 
01:45:15.430 --> 01:45:15.440 align:start position:0%
to put a mandate in then an employee can
 
01:45:16.709 --> 01:45:16.719 align:start position:0%
just leave and go to another hospital
 
01:45:17.990 --> 01:45:18.000 align:start position:0%
doesn't have the mandate or go to
 
01:45:19.669 --> 01:45:19.679 align:start position:0%
another area that didn't have the
 
01:45:21.350 --> 01:45:21.360 align:start position:0%
mandate but that's not what we're doing
 
01:45:23.270 --> 01:45:23.280 align:start position:0%
anymore right that's not the case
 
01:45:25.750 --> 01:45:25.760 align:start position:0%
anymore it's 100 coverage that's the
 
01:45:28.790 --> 01:45:28.800 align:start position:0%
conversation right is that um there are
 
01:45:31.270 --> 01:45:31.280 align:start position:0%
no more safe harbors for our for our
 
01:45:33.750 --> 01:45:33.760 align:start position:0%
nurses and doctors right there are no in
 
01:45:35.910 --> 01:45:35.920 align:start position:0%
in our in our manufacturing plant here
 
01:45:37.910 --> 01:45:37.920 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire there's a significant
 
01:45:40.629 --> 01:45:40.639 align:start position:0%
portion of the of the uh of the um
 
01:45:42.550 --> 01:45:42.560 align:start position:0%
manufacturing have some sort of federal
 
01:45:44.950 --> 01:45:44.960 align:start position:0%
contracts that now they're obligated to
 
01:45:46.629 --> 01:45:46.639 align:start position:0%
follow a mandate and so now even the
 
01:45:48.149 --> 01:45:48.159 align:start position:0%
manufacturing industry we're starting to
 
01:45:51.189 --> 01:45:51.199 align:start position:0%
limit where people can move and perform
 
01:45:53.590 --> 01:45:53.600 align:start position:0%
and do their job right
 
01:45:55.270 --> 01:45:55.280 align:start position:0%
get get get an income to put food on the
 
01:45:57.030 --> 01:45:57.040 align:start position:0%
table i think that's the conversation
 
01:45:58.149 --> 01:45:58.159 align:start position:0%
point that we're talking about when we
 
01:45:59.669 --> 01:45:59.679 align:start position:0%
talk about medical interventions and
 
01:46:00.950 --> 01:46:00.960 align:start position:0%
enforced medical interventions by
 
01:46:00.960 --> 01:46:01.910 align:start position:0%
enforced medical interventions by
government

01:46:01.910 --> 01:46:01.920 align:start position:0%
government
 
01:46:05.189 --> 01:46:05.199 align:start position:0%
um is how how do we
 
01:46:06.790 --> 01:46:06.800 align:start position:0%
how do we deal with that the fact that
 
01:46:08.950 --> 01:46:08.960 align:start position:0%
we're limiting where our our citizenry
 
01:46:11.430 --> 01:46:11.440 align:start position:0%
can work and how does and and is that a
 
01:46:13.270 --> 01:46:13.280 align:start position:0%
role of government to force or is it
 
01:46:15.510 --> 01:46:15.520 align:start position:0%
should it be left to the individuals as
 
01:46:17.030 --> 01:46:17.040 align:start position:0%
it was before all before this all
 
01:46:18.709 --> 01:46:18.719 align:start position:0%
occurred it was up to the individual the
 
01:46:20.550 --> 01:46:20.560 align:start position:0%
individual business owner to say i want
 
01:46:22.470 --> 01:46:22.480 align:start position:0%
to do a mandate or i don't and that's
 
01:46:24.550 --> 01:46:24.560 align:start position:0%
now no longer the case we don't have a
 
01:46:26.470 --> 01:46:26.480 align:start position:0%
state law that says hospitals must do
 
01:46:29.030 --> 01:46:29.040 align:start position:0%
the flu vaccine we don't have that rule
 
01:46:31.350 --> 01:46:31.360 align:start position:0%
that's a hospital's choice but now we
 
01:46:33.270 --> 01:46:33.280 align:start position:0%
have other rules that are being forced
 
01:46:34.709 --> 01:46:34.719 align:start position:0%
so i think that's why we're having this
 
01:46:34.719 --> 01:46:41.430 align:start position:0%
so i think that's why we're having this
discussion

01:46:41.430 --> 01:46:41.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:43.109 --> 01:46:43.119 align:start position:0%
i'll do it in a different
 
01:46:43.119 --> 01:46:47.030 align:start position:0%
i'll do it in a different
aspect

01:46:47.030 --> 01:46:47.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:49.830 --> 01:46:49.840 align:start position:0%
we require certain vaccinations
 
01:46:51.430 --> 01:46:51.440 align:start position:0%
for children
 
01:46:52.830 --> 01:46:52.840 align:start position:0%
if they
 
01:46:55.750 --> 01:46:55.760 align:start position:0%
enter um the education when they go to
 
01:46:55.760 --> 01:46:57.590 align:start position:0%
enter um the education when they go to
school

01:46:57.590 --> 01:46:57.600 align:start position:0%
school
 
01:47:00.390 --> 01:47:00.400 align:start position:0%
is it coercion for those parents to have
 
01:47:03.430 --> 01:47:03.440 align:start position:0%
to take their kids to get vaccinated
 
01:47:04.870 --> 01:47:04.880 align:start position:0%
because they want because it's a
 
01:47:06.629 --> 01:47:06.639 align:start position:0%
requirement for them to be in school
 
01:47:09.910 --> 01:47:09.920 align:start position:0%
it's no different we require it for
 
01:47:12.149 --> 01:47:12.159 align:start position:0%
school you can't go
 
01:47:14.070 --> 01:47:14.080 align:start position:0%
whether in public or private school you
 
01:47:15.430 --> 01:47:15.440 align:start position:0%
have to follow the guidelines for
 
01:47:17.270 --> 01:47:17.280 align:start position:0%
immunizations for children
 
01:47:19.270 --> 01:47:19.280 align:start position:0%
and senator bradley wants to come and i
 
01:47:22.790 --> 01:47:22.800 align:start position:0%
don't think it's any different
 
01:47:24.870 --> 01:47:24.880 align:start position:0%
senator of course
 
01:47:26.790 --> 01:47:26.800 align:start position:0%
please answer his question real quick so
 
01:47:28.790 --> 01:47:28.800 align:start position:0%
to answer your question is we recognize
 
01:47:30.390 --> 01:47:30.400 align:start position:0%
that but we also have provided for an
 
01:47:32.229 --> 01:47:32.239 align:start position:0%
exemption within statute so we created
 
01:47:34.310 --> 01:47:34.320 align:start position:0%
the mandate but we also allowed people
 
01:47:35.430 --> 01:47:35.440 align:start position:0%
to opt out
 
01:47:37.430 --> 01:47:37.440 align:start position:0%
right and and we allow that in state law
 
01:47:39.430 --> 01:47:39.440 align:start position:0%
under another chapter within the 141c
 
01:47:41.669 --> 01:47:41.679 align:start position:0%
statutes right so it's not coercion
 
01:47:43.430 --> 01:47:43.440 align:start position:0%
because parents who are opposed to it
 
01:47:44.870 --> 01:47:44.880 align:start position:0%
have an option
 
01:47:47.430 --> 01:47:47.440 align:start position:0%
and so there is the problem is again the
 
01:47:49.189 --> 01:47:49.199 align:start position:0%
same kind of same kind of argument is
 
01:47:52.149 --> 01:47:52.159 align:start position:0%
that we're doing this now for 1.3
 
01:47:54.149 --> 01:47:54.159 align:start position:0%
million new hampshire residents right
 
01:47:55.590 --> 01:47:55.600 align:start position:0%
and where they can work
 
01:47:58.470 --> 01:47:58.480 align:start position:0%
and so and there aren't a lot of options
 
01:48:00.550 --> 01:48:00.560 align:start position:0%
for opting out and yeah and especially
 
01:48:01.590 --> 01:48:01.600 align:start position:0%
when we have
 
01:48:03.189 --> 01:48:03.199 align:start position:0%
other areas of federal government saying
 
01:48:04.629 --> 01:48:04.639 align:start position:0%
we're going to start questioning some of
 
01:48:07.830 --> 01:48:07.840 align:start position:0%
the exemptions that are being granted
 
01:48:09.430 --> 01:48:09.440 align:start position:0%
you know again we're limiting new
 
01:48:11.270 --> 01:48:11.280 align:start position:0%
hampshire as a pretty broad and easy
 
01:48:14.229 --> 01:48:14.239 align:start position:0%
exemption exemption out for students
 
01:48:16.470 --> 01:48:16.480 align:start position:0%
in this case we don't necessarily have
 
01:48:19.189 --> 01:48:19.199 align:start position:0%
that for what's being pushed down
 
01:48:20.310 --> 01:48:20.320 align:start position:0%
that's all
 
01:48:21.990 --> 01:48:22.000 align:start position:0%
senator bradley go ahead
 
01:48:24.390 --> 01:48:24.400 align:start position:0%
uh thank you very much doctor
 
01:48:24.400 --> 01:48:25.510 align:start position:0%
uh thank you very much doctor
so

01:48:25.510 --> 01:48:25.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:48:25.520 --> 01:48:27.270 align:start position:0%
so
um

01:48:27.270 --> 01:48:27.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:48:29.590 --> 01:48:29.600 align:start position:0%
yesterday the food and drug
 
01:48:33.109 --> 01:48:33.119 align:start position:0%
administration approved um
 
01:48:35.189 --> 01:48:35.199 align:start position:0%
i think it was the
 
01:48:38.229 --> 01:48:38.239 align:start position:0%
pfizer vaccine yeah moderna one of the
 
01:48:38.239 --> 01:48:38.950 align:start position:0%
pfizer vaccine yeah moderna one of the
other

01:48:38.950 --> 01:48:38.960 align:start position:0%
other
 
01:48:38.960 --> 01:48:40.070 align:start position:0%
other
four

01:48:40.070 --> 01:48:40.080 align:start position:0%
four
 
01:48:42.470 --> 01:48:42.480 align:start position:0%
five-year-olds to um
 
01:48:45.030 --> 01:48:45.040 align:start position:0%
11 year old previously had been approved
 
01:48:51.109 --> 01:48:51.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:54.390 --> 01:48:54.400 align:start position:0%
were the four phases of trials
 
01:48:56.470 --> 01:48:56.480 align:start position:0%
adhered to
 
01:48:58.470 --> 01:48:58.480 align:start position:0%
because i think one of the questions
 
01:49:01.109 --> 01:49:01.119 align:start position:0%
that many people have had about this is
 
01:49:01.119 --> 01:49:02.070 align:start position:0%
that many people have had about this is
that

01:49:02.070 --> 01:49:02.080 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:49:04.229 --> 01:49:04.239 align:start position:0%
normally for a vaccine to be approved to
 
01:49:06.790 --> 01:49:06.800 align:start position:0%
take several years of trials
 
01:49:10.629 --> 01:49:10.639 align:start position:0%
to determine its efficacy and safety
 
01:49:13.750 --> 01:49:13.760 align:start position:0%
so i'm just curious about that for the
 
01:49:16.310 --> 01:49:16.320 align:start position:0%
childhood vaccination sure
 
01:49:20.229 --> 01:49:20.239 align:start position:0%
so uh yes on tuesday uh the acip which
 
01:49:23.189 --> 01:49:23.199 align:start position:0%
is that component of the cdc met after
 
01:49:25.589 --> 01:49:25.599 align:start position:0%
uh the fda approved licensing for under
 
01:49:30.310 --> 01:49:30.320 align:start position:0%
eua on thursday for the pfizer vaccine
 
01:49:33.510 --> 01:49:33.520 align:start position:0%
the pfizer vaccine for kids five to 11
 
01:49:35.430 --> 01:49:35.440 align:start position:0%
is a 10 microgram dose which is lower
 
01:49:37.750 --> 01:49:37.760 align:start position:0%
than the adult dose that was uh
 
01:49:40.470 --> 01:49:40.480 align:start position:0%
previously released under eua and then
 
01:49:40.480 --> 01:49:41.589 align:start position:0%
previously released under eua and then
officially

01:49:41.589 --> 01:49:41.599 align:start position:0%
officially
 
01:49:41.599 --> 01:49:43.030 align:start position:0%
officially
approved

01:49:43.030 --> 01:49:43.040 align:start position:0%
approved
 
01:49:45.669 --> 01:49:45.679 align:start position:0%
that did go through the four phases
 
01:49:48.470 --> 01:49:48.480 align:start position:0%
and those trials have been going on the
 
01:49:51.030 --> 01:49:51.040 align:start position:0%
clinical trials in the setting of
 
01:49:53.830 --> 01:49:53.840 align:start position:0%
looking at patients to enroll started at
 
01:49:55.430 --> 01:49:55.440 align:start position:0%
least in march i know that's when i
 
01:49:56.790 --> 01:49:56.800 align:start position:0%
enrolled my children in the trials
 
01:49:58.709 --> 01:49:58.719 align:start position:0%
unfortunately they didn't get called
 
01:50:00.149 --> 01:50:00.159 align:start position:0%
but that's been going on for quite some
 
01:50:00.159 --> 01:50:01.270 align:start position:0%
but that's been going on for quite some
time

01:50:01.270 --> 01:50:01.280 align:start position:0%
time
 
01:50:03.830 --> 01:50:03.840 align:start position:0%
as you go through these uh trials there
 
01:50:05.589 --> 01:50:05.599 align:start position:0%
are a variety of statistical components
 
01:50:07.589 --> 01:50:07.599 align:start position:0%
that go into this to ensure that you
 
01:50:09.270 --> 01:50:09.280 align:start position:0%
have enough
 
01:50:12.629 --> 01:50:12.639 align:start position:0%
uh data to draw a conclusion
 
01:50:15.270 --> 01:50:15.280 align:start position:0%
that helps to determine the end point of
 
01:50:16.470 --> 01:50:16.480 align:start position:0%
a study
 
01:50:18.070 --> 01:50:18.080 align:start position:0%
as well as
 
01:50:21.669 --> 01:50:21.679 align:start position:0%
to ensure that you're not doing harm
 
01:50:25.990 --> 01:50:26.000 align:start position:0%
either by administering the treatment of
 
01:50:28.550 --> 01:50:28.560 align:start position:0%
involved or by limiting the treatment
 
01:50:29.990 --> 01:50:30.000 align:start position:0%
involved and in fact with some of these
 
01:50:31.189 --> 01:50:31.199 align:start position:0%
studies particularly with one of the
 
01:50:33.830 --> 01:50:33.840 align:start position:0%
moderna studies they showed the
 
01:50:35.589 --> 01:50:35.599 align:start position:0%
efficacy to be so high that they stopped
 
01:50:36.950 --> 01:50:36.960 align:start position:0%
the trial early
 
01:50:38.790 --> 01:50:38.800 align:start position:0%
because it was showing harm not to offer
 
01:50:39.990 --> 01:50:40.000 align:start position:0%
it to people
 
01:50:42.149 --> 01:50:42.159 align:start position:0%
so no all four of those phases
 
01:50:45.109 --> 01:50:45.119 align:start position:0%
did continue uh through that the five to
 
01:50:47.910 --> 01:50:47.920 align:start position:0%
11 year old group
 
01:50:49.669 --> 01:50:49.679 align:start position:0%
again was submitted right at the end of
 
01:50:51.990 --> 01:50:52.000 align:start position:0%
september with that data there's been
 
01:50:53.830 --> 01:50:53.840 align:start position:0%
ongoing studies
 
01:50:56.310 --> 01:50:56.320 align:start position:0%
with both pfizer and moderna as well
 
01:50:59.109 --> 01:50:59.119 align:start position:0%
since that early spring time for kids
 
01:51:01.510 --> 01:51:01.520 align:start position:0%
six months and up and those are ongoing
 
01:51:01.520 --> 01:51:02.709 align:start position:0%
six months and up and those are ongoing
trials

01:51:02.709 --> 01:51:02.719 align:start position:0%
trials
 
01:51:04.550 --> 01:51:04.560 align:start position:0%
the speed with which this has come to
 
01:51:06.470 --> 01:51:06.480 align:start position:0%
market has been a couple of different
 
01:51:08.229 --> 01:51:08.239 align:start position:0%
things i think one
 
01:51:09.669 --> 01:51:09.679 align:start position:0%
there's been a lot more publicity and
 
01:51:11.350 --> 01:51:11.360 align:start position:0%
knowledge about it i don't think anybody
 
01:51:13.189 --> 01:51:13.199 align:start position:0%
has known about the acip more than they
 
01:51:14.870 --> 01:51:14.880 align:start position:0%
have now
 
01:51:17.430 --> 01:51:17.440 align:start position:0%
there has been a lot of information the
 
01:51:20.229 --> 01:51:20.239 align:start position:0%
way this vaccine the specifically the
 
01:51:22.470 --> 01:51:22.480 align:start position:0%
mrna vaccine so the pfizer madonna
 
01:51:25.189 --> 01:51:25.199 align:start position:0%
vaccines are created is a little bit
 
01:51:26.629 --> 01:51:26.639 align:start position:0%
different than some of our other
 
01:51:28.390 --> 01:51:28.400 align:start position:0%
vaccines the technology's been around
 
01:51:29.910 --> 01:51:29.920 align:start position:0%
for about 20 years
 
01:51:31.350 --> 01:51:31.360 align:start position:0%
and it really hasn't come to the general
 
01:51:33.589 --> 01:51:33.599 align:start position:0%
market because we just haven't had a
 
01:51:35.430 --> 01:51:35.440 align:start position:0%
virus that would be appropriately
 
01:51:37.189 --> 01:51:37.199 align:start position:0%
targeted by these vaccines but they've
 
01:51:39.030 --> 01:51:39.040 align:start position:0%
been around for a couple decades
 
01:51:41.669 --> 01:51:41.679 align:start position:0%
uh you know mers and sars and some of
 
01:51:43.430 --> 01:51:43.440 align:start position:0%
these other uh viruses have burned out
 
01:51:45.109 --> 01:51:45.119 align:start position:0%
really quickly and so we just haven't
 
01:51:46.550 --> 01:51:46.560 align:start position:0%
seen that in our general population
 
01:51:48.310 --> 01:51:48.320 align:start position:0%
potentially in the military in other
 
01:51:50.229 --> 01:51:50.239 align:start position:0%
parts of the world but not here in the
 
01:51:52.629 --> 01:51:52.639 align:start position:0%
general population united states
 
01:51:54.870 --> 01:51:54.880 align:start position:0%
the way this works is typically during
 
01:51:56.870 --> 01:51:56.880 align:start position:0%
vaccine production
 
01:51:59.430 --> 01:51:59.440 align:start position:0%
in this scenario you have a number of
 
01:52:01.350 --> 01:52:01.360 align:start position:0%
steps the last step which is a very slow
 
01:52:04.709 --> 01:52:04.719 align:start position:0%
step is creating the protein that your
 
01:52:07.350 --> 01:52:07.360 align:start position:0%
body is going to recognize as a foreign
 
01:52:09.589 --> 01:52:09.599 align:start position:0%
so that you can then your immune system
 
01:52:12.310 --> 01:52:12.320 align:start position:0%
can see that and create a response
 
01:52:15.430 --> 01:52:15.440 align:start position:0%
prior to this mrna vaccine technology
 
01:52:17.589 --> 01:52:17.599 align:start position:0%
that last step has happened in a petri
 
01:52:20.629 --> 01:52:20.639 align:start position:0%
dish in a lab so you had to infect cells
 
01:52:22.629 --> 01:52:22.639 align:start position:0%
have them make a
 
01:52:25.189 --> 01:52:25.199 align:start position:0%
protein harvest that protein
 
01:52:27.669 --> 01:52:27.679 align:start position:0%
and then administer that protein
 
01:52:30.149 --> 01:52:30.159 align:start position:0%
what happens now is that with this mrna
 
01:52:32.310 --> 01:52:32.320 align:start position:0%
vaccine you're getting the recipe for
 
01:52:33.910 --> 01:52:33.920 align:start position:0%
the protein
 
01:52:36.550 --> 01:52:36.560 align:start position:0%
that recipe that mrna is there it gets
 
01:52:38.070 --> 01:52:38.080 align:start position:0%
read by your ribosomes that make the
 
01:52:40.870 --> 01:52:40.880 align:start position:0%
protein and like every other protein
 
01:52:43.750 --> 01:52:43.760 align:start position:0%
mrna recipe in your body is subsequently
 
01:52:46.390 --> 01:52:46.400 align:start position:0%
destroyed it then presents that protein
 
01:52:48.070 --> 01:52:48.080 align:start position:0%
your body sees that says hey this
 
01:52:49.669 --> 01:52:49.679 align:start position:0%
doesn't belong and makes that our immune
 
01:52:51.910 --> 01:52:51.920 align:start position:0%
response so some of the time frame has
 
01:52:54.790 --> 01:52:54.800 align:start position:0%
been that production of this has been
 
01:52:57.030 --> 01:52:57.040 align:start position:0%
due to just the shortening process of
 
01:52:59.030 --> 01:52:59.040 align:start position:0%
actually having to make this vaccine
 
01:53:01.189 --> 01:53:01.199 align:start position:0%
because of the way that it works
 
01:53:01.199 --> 01:53:02.070 align:start position:0%
because of the way that it works
but

01:53:02.070 --> 01:53:02.080 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:53:04.709 --> 01:53:04.719 align:start position:0%
the information around
 
01:53:07.510 --> 01:53:07.520 align:start position:0%
the phases of study has absolutely been
 
01:53:09.830 --> 01:53:09.840 align:start position:0%
uh complied with
 
01:53:11.830 --> 01:53:11.840 align:start position:0%
i hope that's
 
01:53:11.840 --> 01:53:12.709 align:start position:0%
i hope that's
so

01:53:12.709 --> 01:53:12.719 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:53:14.950 --> 01:53:14.960 align:start position:0%
in looking at the
 
01:53:14.960 --> 01:53:15.910 align:start position:0%
in looking at the
um

01:53:15.910 --> 01:53:15.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:53:18.310 --> 01:53:18.320 align:start position:0%
statute that we passed last year
 
01:53:20.950 --> 01:53:20.960 align:start position:0%
representative lang's bill
 
01:53:20.960 --> 01:53:22.870 align:start position:0%
representative lang's bill
um

01:53:22.870 --> 01:53:22.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:53:24.070 --> 01:53:24.080 align:start position:0%
and i don't know if
 
01:53:26.310 --> 01:53:26.320 align:start position:0%
you feel you can answer this or mike you
 
01:53:28.790 --> 01:53:28.800 align:start position:0%
feel you can answer this but i i guess i
 
01:53:30.629 --> 01:53:30.639 align:start position:0%
would post the question anybody in the
 
01:53:30.639 --> 01:53:31.589 align:start position:0%
would post the question anybody in the
room

01:53:31.589 --> 01:53:31.599 align:start position:0%
room
 
01:53:33.109 --> 01:53:33.119 align:start position:0%
the way it
 
01:53:36.229 --> 01:53:36.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:39.510 --> 01:53:39.520 align:start position:0%
my question i guess is
 
01:53:43.910 --> 01:53:43.920 align:start position:0%
now that the fda has approved
 
01:53:49.350 --> 01:53:49.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:52.709 --> 01:53:52.719 align:start position:0%
people between the age of 5 and 11
 
01:53:55.030 --> 01:53:55.040 align:start position:0%
does the commissioner of the department
 
01:53:57.510 --> 01:53:57.520 align:start position:0%
of health and human services have the
 
01:53:57.520 --> 01:53:58.870 align:start position:0%
of health and human services have the
authority

01:53:58.870 --> 01:53:58.880 align:start position:0%
authority
 
01:54:00.790 --> 01:54:00.800 align:start position:0%
to mandate
 
01:54:03.350 --> 01:54:03.360 align:start position:0%
as a precondition of
 
01:54:06.310 --> 01:54:06.320 align:start position:0%
attending school
 
01:54:06.320 --> 01:54:07.830 align:start position:0%
attending school
getting

01:54:07.830 --> 01:54:07.840 align:start position:0%
getting
 
01:54:10.229 --> 01:54:10.239 align:start position:0%
that covered shot
 
01:54:10.239 --> 01:54:11.109 align:start position:0%
that covered shot
given

01:54:11.109 --> 01:54:11.119 align:start position:0%
given
 
01:54:11.119 --> 01:54:12.390 align:start position:0%
given
the

01:54:12.390 --> 01:54:12.400 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:54:15.030 --> 01:54:15.040 align:start position:0%
statute that we passed last year
 
01:54:18.070 --> 01:54:18.080 align:start position:0%
so uh independent of that uh because my
 
01:54:20.229 --> 01:54:20.239 align:start position:0%
understanding is no because it is under
 
01:54:22.629 --> 01:54:22.639 align:start position:0%
emergency youth use authorization and
 
01:54:22.639 --> 01:54:23.750 align:start position:0%
emergency youth use authorization and
the

01:54:23.750 --> 01:54:23.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:54:25.350 --> 01:54:25.360 align:start position:0%
hospitals association can probably speak
 
01:54:27.030 --> 01:54:27.040 align:start position:0%
to that as well
 
01:54:29.750 --> 01:54:29.760 align:start position:0%
that differentiation between emergency
 
01:54:33.830 --> 01:54:33.840 align:start position:0%
use authorization the eua and a full
 
01:54:33.840 --> 01:54:35.030 align:start position:0%
use authorization the eua and a full
approval

01:54:35.030 --> 01:54:35.040 align:start position:0%
approval
 
01:54:36.950 --> 01:54:36.960 align:start position:0%
has made a significant difference in
 
01:54:38.870 --> 01:54:38.880 align:start position:0%
terms of the ability to make those
 
01:54:38.880 --> 01:54:40.229 align:start position:0%
terms of the ability to make those
mandatory

01:54:40.229 --> 01:54:40.239 align:start position:0%
mandatory
 
01:54:43.589 --> 01:54:43.599 align:start position:0%
so at this point with 5 to 11 as well as
 
01:54:45.669 --> 01:54:45.679 align:start position:0%
12 to 18 which would be your general
 
01:54:48.229 --> 01:54:48.239 align:start position:0%
school population there's not a vaccine
 
01:54:51.109 --> 01:54:51.119 align:start position:0%
that is no longer is not um out of that
 
01:54:53.589 --> 01:54:53.599 align:start position:0%
eua period um so my understanding is
 
01:54:54.709 --> 01:54:54.719 align:start position:0%
that no they could not make that
 
01:54:56.470 --> 01:54:56.480 align:start position:0%
mandatory at this time
 
01:54:58.390 --> 01:54:58.400 align:start position:0%
with regard to when that comes into play
 
01:54:59.830 --> 01:54:59.840 align:start position:0%
in this bill
 
01:55:01.910 --> 01:55:01.920 align:start position:0%
i struggled a little bit as i read it i
 
01:55:04.070 --> 01:55:04.080 align:start position:0%
was concerned that that
 
01:55:08.149 --> 01:55:08.159 align:start position:0%
the bill as i read it allowed for uh
 
01:55:09.750 --> 01:55:09.760 align:start position:0%
covert vaccine and the ones that we
 
01:55:11.270 --> 01:55:11.280 align:start position:0%
already have currently standing in the
 
01:55:13.350 --> 01:55:13.360 align:start position:0%
state uh to potentially no longer be
 
01:55:13.360 --> 01:55:14.470 align:start position:0%
state uh to potentially no longer be
required

01:55:14.470 --> 01:55:14.480 align:start position:0%
required
 
01:55:16.790 --> 01:55:16.800 align:start position:0%
but somebody who has a little more
 
01:55:19.430 --> 01:55:19.440 align:start position:0%
legalese than i do
 
01:55:22.229 --> 01:55:22.239 align:start position:0%
i think that the way the
 
01:55:24.629 --> 01:55:24.639 align:start position:0%
language was written
 
01:55:24.639 --> 01:55:27.270 align:start position:0%
language was written
that

01:55:27.270 --> 01:55:27.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:30.830 --> 01:55:30.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:34.229 --> 01:55:34.239 align:start position:0%
the paragraph two refers to paragraph
 
01:55:35.990 --> 01:55:36.000 align:start position:0%
one which talks about natural and
 
01:55:38.950 --> 01:55:38.960 align:start position:0%
inherent rights and then paragraph two
 
01:55:42.229 --> 01:55:42.239 align:start position:0%
says paragraph one shall not
 
01:55:44.790 --> 01:55:44.800 align:start position:0%
supersede the requirement for
 
01:55:47.350 --> 01:55:47.360 align:start position:0%
vaccination as a prerequisite for
 
01:55:49.990 --> 01:55:50.000 align:start position:0%
admission to a school or child care
 
01:55:54.229 --> 01:55:54.239 align:start position:0%
agency pursuant rsa 141
 
01:55:54.239 --> 01:55:55.030 align:start position:0%
agency pursuant rsa 141
so

01:55:55.030 --> 01:55:55.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:55:57.750 --> 01:55:57.760 align:start position:0%
there is a process in place as i
 
01:55:59.270 --> 01:55:59.280 align:start position:0%
understand it
 
01:56:03.990 --> 01:56:04.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:06.790 --> 01:56:06.800 align:start position:0%
mandate certain vaccinations for as a
 
01:56:06.800 --> 01:56:09.669 align:start position:0%
mandate certain vaccinations for as a
precondition

01:56:09.669 --> 01:56:09.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:12.550 --> 01:56:12.560 align:start position:0%
i'm glad you pointed out the eua
 
01:56:12.560 --> 01:56:14.790 align:start position:0%
i'm glad you pointed out the eua
provision

01:56:14.790 --> 01:56:14.800 align:start position:0%
provision
 
01:56:17.589 --> 01:56:17.599 align:start position:0%
for adults i think it's it's advisor or
 
01:56:21.030 --> 01:56:21.040 align:start position:0%
moderna that has gone beyond the ua but
 
01:56:23.350 --> 01:56:23.360 align:start position:0%
adults only yeah so fives are just for
 
01:56:24.950 --> 01:56:24.960 align:start position:0%
adults only my understanding is it's
 
01:56:28.709 --> 01:56:28.719 align:start position:0%
just the 18 and up pfizer
 
01:56:30.470 --> 01:56:30.480 align:start position:0%
has received that full approval so right
 
01:56:33.030 --> 01:56:33.040 align:start position:0%
now for our pediatric patients it's all
 
01:56:34.950 --> 01:56:34.960 align:start position:0%
under that emergency youth use
 
01:56:37.669 --> 01:56:37.679 align:start position:0%
authorization and so therefore uh would
 
01:56:39.510 --> 01:56:39.520 align:start position:0%
not be able to be made mandatory in any
 
01:56:41.350 --> 01:56:41.360 align:start position:0%
of those settings and schools or
 
01:56:45.189 --> 01:56:45.199 align:start position:0%
employers okay so at this point in time
 
01:56:45.199 --> 01:56:47.510 align:start position:0%
employers okay so at this point in time
um

01:56:47.510 --> 01:56:47.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:50.070 --> 01:56:50.080 align:start position:0%
the commissioner because of the e
 
01:56:52.629 --> 01:56:52.639 align:start position:0%
the emergency use authorization
 
01:56:55.589 --> 01:56:55.599 align:start position:0%
it could not be mandated for five to 11
 
01:56:56.950 --> 01:56:56.960 align:start position:0%
year olds all right
 
01:56:59.430 --> 01:56:59.440 align:start position:0%
i think um just as a
 
01:57:01.750 --> 01:57:01.760 align:start position:0%
sort of a general issue for all the
 
01:57:04.070 --> 01:57:04.080 align:start position:0%
legal beagles in this room and those
 
01:57:06.229 --> 01:57:06.239 align:start position:0%
that aren't in this room
 
01:57:08.470 --> 01:57:08.480 align:start position:0%
having clarity on the
 
01:57:08.480 --> 01:57:09.270 align:start position:0%
having clarity on the
law

01:57:09.270 --> 01:57:09.280 align:start position:0%
law
 
01:57:11.750 --> 01:57:11.760 align:start position:0%
and what could or maybe couldn't and i'm
 
01:57:13.430 --> 01:57:13.440 align:start position:0%
not taking a position one way or the
 
01:57:15.669 --> 01:57:15.679 align:start position:0%
other at this point but i just the
 
01:57:17.350 --> 01:57:17.360 align:start position:0%
understanding of
 
01:57:19.830 --> 01:57:19.840 align:start position:0%
what your language and your bill allows
 
01:57:22.070 --> 01:57:22.080 align:start position:0%
or doesn't allow vis-a-vis
 
01:57:24.149 --> 01:57:24.159 align:start position:0%
an update to the statute will be
 
01:57:25.589 --> 01:57:25.599 align:start position:0%
interesting so
 
01:57:27.030 --> 01:57:27.040 align:start position:0%
i guess i'd
 
01:57:29.910 --> 01:57:29.920 align:start position:0%
invite people to opine on that
 
01:57:31.830 --> 01:57:31.840 align:start position:0%
you know you can get back to us
 
01:57:33.510 --> 01:57:33.520 align:start position:0%
electronically i think that would be a
 
01:57:35.910 --> 01:57:35.920 align:start position:0%
useful discussion
 
01:57:37.510 --> 01:57:37.520 align:start position:0%
especially given the fact that we have
 
01:57:39.830 --> 01:57:39.840 align:start position:0%
55 vaccine bills that you folks are
 
01:57:42.070 --> 01:57:42.080 align:start position:0%
going to you know deal with before they
 
01:57:43.910 --> 01:57:43.920 align:start position:0%
come to us
 
01:57:45.990 --> 01:57:46.000 align:start position:0%
thank you you're welcome too you're down
 
01:57:48.070 --> 01:57:48.080 align:start position:0%
to 32 yeah
 
01:57:51.030 --> 01:57:51.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:53.350 --> 01:57:53.360 align:start position:0%
um any other questions for the new
 
01:57:55.669 --> 01:57:55.679 align:start position:0%
hampshire medical society
 
01:57:57.589 --> 01:57:57.599 align:start position:0%
i i would ask that maybe the medical
 
01:57:59.270 --> 01:57:59.280 align:start position:0%
society consider that conversation we
 
01:58:01.109 --> 01:58:01.119 align:start position:0%
just had about informed consent and free
 
01:58:02.550 --> 01:58:02.560 align:start position:0%
and fair informed consent maybe get back
 
01:58:05.430 --> 01:58:05.440 align:start position:0%
with our email um you know and how how
 
01:58:07.109 --> 01:58:07.119 align:start position:0%
that plays out because that's a really
 
01:58:09.669 --> 01:58:09.679 align:start position:0%
of interest to me and how positions
 
01:58:11.750 --> 01:58:11.760 align:start position:0%
you know are being stuck in a kind of a
 
01:58:13.910 --> 01:58:13.920 align:start position:0%
bad spot and how we can either
 
01:58:15.750 --> 01:58:15.760 align:start position:0%
potentially fix that or not or or how
 
01:58:17.109 --> 01:58:17.119 align:start position:0%
that can be dealt with
 
01:58:19.350 --> 01:58:19.360 align:start position:0%
yeah mr chair sorry that i was not quick
 
01:58:20.790 --> 01:58:20.800 align:start position:0%
enough with my hand i actually had
 
01:58:23.109 --> 01:58:23.119 align:start position:0%
another question for dr johnson
 
01:58:25.109 --> 01:58:25.119 align:start position:0%
um thank you for all of the information
 
01:58:26.550 --> 01:58:26.560 align:start position:0%
that you presented and especially
 
01:58:27.990 --> 01:58:28.000 align:start position:0%
recognizing the difference between the
 
01:58:30.550 --> 01:58:30.560 align:start position:0%
eua and the full approval
 
01:58:32.390 --> 01:58:32.400 align:start position:0%
and your compassion for your patients
 
01:58:34.310 --> 01:58:34.320 align:start position:0%
especially those ones at higher risk
 
01:58:36.070 --> 01:58:36.080 align:start position:0%
because maybe they're publicly insured
 
01:58:37.910 --> 01:58:37.920 align:start position:0%
or they have cancer
 
01:58:40.390 --> 01:58:40.400 align:start position:0%
i wasn't sure how deeply you follow the
 
01:58:41.990 --> 01:58:42.000 align:start position:0%
science but i don't know if you're aware
 
01:58:43.270 --> 01:58:43.280 align:start position:0%
that there's a study that was in the
 
01:58:45.350 --> 01:58:45.360 align:start position:0%
journal of clinical oncology
 
01:58:47.589 --> 01:58:47.599 align:start position:0%
from emily johnston of the institute for
 
01:58:49.750 --> 01:58:49.760 align:start position:0%
cancer outcomes and survivorship in
 
01:58:54.149 --> 01:58:54.159 align:start position:0%
alabama so they followed 917 pediatric
 
01:58:55.510 --> 01:58:55.520 align:start position:0%
cancer patients
 
01:58:58.870 --> 01:58:58.880 align:start position:0%
there were 44 percent hispanic 59
 
01:59:02.310 --> 01:59:02.320 align:start position:0%
publicly insured 66 with hematologic
 
01:59:02.320 --> 01:59:03.990 align:start position:0%
publicly insured 66 with hematologic
malignancies

01:59:03.990 --> 01:59:04.000 align:start position:0%
malignancies
 
01:59:06.550 --> 01:59:06.560 align:start position:0%
it actually was quite fascinating
 
01:59:09.109 --> 01:59:09.119 align:start position:0%
45 of them needed their cancer therapy
 
01:59:09.119 --> 01:59:10.470 align:start position:0%
45 of them needed their cancer therapy
modified

01:59:10.470 --> 01:59:10.480 align:start position:0%
modified
 
01:59:13.030 --> 01:59:13.040 align:start position:0%
but when you looked to what actually
 
01:59:18.470 --> 01:59:18.480 align:start position:0%
happened you had um for hospitalization
 
01:59:22.550 --> 01:59:22.560 align:start position:0%
there was a risk of one sorry
 
01:59:23.990 --> 01:59:24.000 align:start position:0%
when you look at the hospitalization
 
01:59:25.430 --> 01:59:25.440 align:start position:0%
rates you look at the death rates there
 
01:59:27.350 --> 01:59:27.360 align:start position:0%
was only one point there were here we go
 
01:59:29.189 --> 01:59:29.199 align:start position:0%
here it is there were 10 percent that
 
01:59:32.470 --> 01:59:32.480 align:start position:0%
needed respiratory support 9.2 admitted
 
01:59:35.589 --> 01:59:35.599 align:start position:0%
to the icu and 1.6 percent died due to
 
01:59:38.070 --> 01:59:38.080 align:start position:0%
sars coveted infection um and there
 
01:59:39.750 --> 01:59:39.760 align:start position:0%
actually was an underlying study when
 
01:59:41.910 --> 01:59:41.920 align:start position:0%
they were looking at disparity in care
 
01:59:44.149 --> 01:59:44.159 align:start position:0%
for a very similar patient population
 
01:59:45.589 --> 01:59:45.599 align:start position:0%
and in that where they identified that
 
01:59:49.030 --> 01:59:49.040 align:start position:0%
hispanics have lower outcomes in cancer
 
01:59:52.070 --> 01:59:52.080 align:start position:0%
that study also showed a 1.6 death rate
 
01:59:54.550 --> 01:59:54.560 align:start position:0%
from cancer over that same time period
 
01:59:56.950 --> 01:59:56.960 align:start position:0%
so it's actually really heartening to
 
01:59:59.030 --> 01:59:59.040 align:start position:0%
know that even our pediatric pediatric
 
02:00:01.510 --> 02:00:01.520 align:start position:0%
oncology patients still do well as
 
02:00:04.070 --> 02:00:04.080 align:start position:0%
children because children's outcomes are
 
02:00:06.709 --> 02:00:06.719 align:start position:0%
better than adults sure
 
02:00:09.109 --> 02:00:09.119 align:start position:0%
just to speak to that uh it's very
 
02:00:11.270 --> 02:00:11.280 align:start position:0%
interesting and as we look at these
 
02:00:12.550 --> 02:00:12.560 align:start position:0%
studies that's not one i'm particularly
 
02:00:14.149 --> 02:00:14.159 align:start position:0%
familiar with but
 
02:00:15.990 --> 02:00:16.000 align:start position:0%
i think something that we've noticed in
 
02:00:18.229 --> 02:00:18.239 align:start position:0%
our practice on a regular basis are the
 
02:00:20.070 --> 02:00:20.080 align:start position:0%
consequences of some of those underlying
 
02:00:21.910 --> 02:00:21.920 align:start position:0%
risk factors
 
02:00:25.189 --> 02:00:25.199 align:start position:0%
many of those children who are at high
 
02:00:27.109 --> 02:00:27.119 align:start position:0%
risk for their own reasons or for family
 
02:00:29.910 --> 02:00:29.920 align:start position:0%
members reasons elected last year to do
 
02:00:31.669 --> 02:00:31.679 align:start position:0%
their learning from home and not to be
 
02:00:35.189 --> 02:00:35.199 align:start position:0%
in school uh they elected uh not to
 
02:00:37.990 --> 02:00:38.000 align:start position:0%
leave their house uh by the families who
 
02:00:39.589 --> 02:00:39.599 align:start position:0%
literally did not leave the house for
 
02:00:41.830 --> 02:00:41.840 align:start position:0%
nine months um that has a significant
 
02:00:44.229 --> 02:00:44.239 align:start position:0%
impact as well and unfortunately those
 
02:00:45.350 --> 02:00:45.360 align:start position:0%
are things that are really challenging
 
02:00:46.950 --> 02:00:46.960 align:start position:0%
for us to measure
 
02:00:48.709 --> 02:00:48.719 align:start position:0%
what those outcomes are whether that's a
 
02:00:50.790 --> 02:00:50.800 align:start position:0%
mental health outcome an educational
 
02:00:50.800 --> 02:00:51.830 align:start position:0%
mental health outcome an educational
outcome

02:00:51.830 --> 02:00:51.840 align:start position:0%
outcome
 
02:00:54.390 --> 02:00:54.400 align:start position:0%
for that individual child
 
02:00:56.470 --> 02:00:56.480 align:start position:0%
for that family as we look at the
 
02:00:58.550 --> 02:00:58.560 align:start position:0%
consequences of the behaviors that they
 
02:01:00.149 --> 02:01:00.159 align:start position:0%
may have put in place to keep themselves
 
02:01:00.159 --> 02:01:00.950 align:start position:0%
may have put in place to keep themselves
safe

02:01:00.950 --> 02:01:00.960 align:start position:0%
safe
 
02:01:03.430 --> 02:01:03.440 align:start position:0%
and while i'm so excited to hear that
 
02:01:05.270 --> 02:01:05.280 align:start position:0%
those numbers are as reassuring as they
 
02:01:05.280 --> 02:01:06.310 align:start position:0%
those numbers are as reassuring as they
are

02:01:06.310 --> 02:01:06.320 align:start position:0%
are
 
02:01:08.550 --> 02:01:08.560 align:start position:0%
i do really have very valid concerns i
 
02:01:11.189 --> 02:01:11.199 align:start position:0%
think for those uh changes that people
 
02:01:13.270 --> 02:01:13.280 align:start position:0%
experience to be able to attain those
 
02:01:13.280 --> 02:01:14.229 align:start position:0%
experience to be able to attain those
outcomes

02:01:14.229 --> 02:01:14.239 align:start position:0%
outcomes
 
02:01:16.709 --> 02:01:16.719 align:start position:0%
uh with avoiding things that we know are
 
02:01:18.229 --> 02:01:18.239 align:start position:0%
really important for children and their
 
02:01:18.239 --> 02:01:19.830 align:start position:0%
really important for children and their
development

02:01:19.830 --> 02:01:19.840 align:start position:0%
development
 
02:01:21.910 --> 02:01:21.920 align:start position:0%
thank you and i actually do have one
 
02:01:23.669 --> 02:01:23.679 align:start position:0%
comment on the speed of development of
 
02:01:25.270 --> 02:01:25.280 align:start position:0%
the vaccines
 
02:01:27.030 --> 02:01:27.040 align:start position:0%
back when i was a device analyst i went
 
02:01:28.390 --> 02:01:28.400 align:start position:0%
to a vaccine
 
02:01:30.629 --> 02:01:30.639 align:start position:0%
conference about developing a vaccine
 
02:01:32.790 --> 02:01:32.800 align:start position:0%
for the next pandemic
 
02:01:34.550 --> 02:01:34.560 align:start position:0%
we were right after the first sars and
 
02:01:36.070 --> 02:01:36.080 align:start position:0%
it was quite fascinating but there were
 
02:01:37.270 --> 02:01:37.280 align:start position:0%
some things where they expanded the
 
02:01:40.070 --> 02:01:40.080 align:start position:0%
pediatric vaccine registry and the adult
 
02:01:41.109 --> 02:01:41.119 align:start position:0%
administration so we'd have
 
02:01:43.430 --> 02:01:43.440 align:start position:0%
manufacturing capacity so it's been a
 
02:01:45.109 --> 02:01:45.119 align:start position:0%
multifaceted approach it's something
 
02:01:46.470 --> 02:01:46.480 align:start position:0%
that they've been working on for many
 
02:01:48.070 --> 02:01:48.080 align:start position:0%
years and it's quite fascinating that
 
02:01:50.229 --> 02:01:50.239 align:start position:0%
people have the opportunity to have
 
02:01:52.870 --> 02:01:52.880 align:start position:0%
vaccines so early in this it's just uh
 
02:01:54.390 --> 02:01:54.400 align:start position:0%
wanting to respect the potential side
 
02:01:56.870 --> 02:01:56.880 align:start position:0%
effects as well where people do want
 
02:01:58.629 --> 02:01:58.639 align:start position:0%
to have respect for that personal
 
02:02:00.709 --> 02:02:00.719 align:start position:0%
autonomy if their risk factors are high
 
02:02:02.629 --> 02:02:02.639 align:start position:0%
enough or they have their religious or
 
02:02:04.709 --> 02:02:04.719 align:start position:0%
medical reasons so that's why it's such
 
02:02:06.550 --> 02:02:06.560 align:start position:0%
a challenging discussion but such an
 
02:02:08.390 --> 02:02:08.400 align:start position:0%
important one to have so thank you
 
02:02:09.910 --> 02:02:09.920 align:start position:0%
you're welcome it certainly is a a
 
02:02:11.750 --> 02:02:11.760 align:start position:0%
challenge i think just to speak to that
 
02:02:13.589 --> 02:02:13.599 align:start position:0%
to help reassure folks it's a common
 
02:02:15.669 --> 02:02:15.679 align:start position:0%
conversation we have in my practice
 
02:02:17.910 --> 02:02:17.920 align:start position:0%
the way that we receive information
 
02:02:19.990 --> 02:02:20.000 align:start position:0%
around vaccine side effects has also
 
02:02:22.790 --> 02:02:22.800 align:start position:0%
changed pretty dramatically with this uh
 
02:02:25.669 --> 02:02:25.679 align:start position:0%
vaccine rollout in the last year
 
02:02:25.679 --> 02:02:26.950 align:start position:0%
vaccine rollout in the last year
for

02:02:26.950 --> 02:02:26.960 align:start position:0%
for
 
02:02:28.709 --> 02:02:28.719 align:start position:0%
for all people who have received this
 
02:02:30.870 --> 02:02:30.880 align:start position:0%
vaccine they have an opportunity to
 
02:02:30.880 --> 02:02:32.390 align:start position:0%
vaccine they have an opportunity to
participate

02:02:32.390 --> 02:02:32.400 align:start position:0%
participate
 
02:02:34.390 --> 02:02:34.400 align:start position:0%
in the v safe program through the
 
02:02:34.400 --> 02:02:35.430 align:start position:0%
in the v safe program through the
cvc

02:02:35.430 --> 02:02:35.440 align:start position:0%
cvc
 
02:02:37.589 --> 02:02:37.599 align:start position:0%
and that has allowed people to give
 
02:02:39.830 --> 02:02:39.840 align:start position:0%
feedback very directly in real time for
 
02:02:42.629 --> 02:02:42.639 align:start position:0%
how they are doing after vaccine
 
02:02:44.790 --> 02:02:44.800 align:start position:0%
classically you've had to make a formal
 
02:02:46.390 --> 02:02:46.400 align:start position:0%
report to
 
02:02:48.629 --> 02:02:48.639 align:start position:0%
some entity at the federal level about a
 
02:02:50.390 --> 02:02:50.400 align:start position:0%
concern that you had
 
02:02:51.750 --> 02:02:51.760 align:start position:0%
right now
 
02:02:53.189 --> 02:02:53.199 align:start position:0%
i've been getting since i just got my
 
02:02:54.470 --> 02:02:54.480 align:start position:0%
booster a week ago i've been getting
 
02:02:56.310 --> 02:02:56.320 align:start position:0%
daily text messages from vsafe saying
 
02:02:58.149 --> 02:02:58.159 align:start position:0%
how are you feeling today
 
02:02:59.910 --> 02:02:59.920 align:start position:0%
and it gives you that opportunity to say
 
02:03:01.510 --> 02:03:01.520 align:start position:0%
you know my elbows are kind of achy this
 
02:03:03.270 --> 02:03:03.280 align:start position:0%
is weird it probably has nothing to do
 
02:03:05.669 --> 02:03:05.679 align:start position:0%
with this vaccine but my elbows hurt so
 
02:03:08.149 --> 02:03:08.159 align:start position:0%
my elbows hurt uh so we've been able to
 
02:03:09.589 --> 02:03:09.599 align:start position:0%
collect data in a very different way
 
02:03:11.830 --> 02:03:11.840 align:start position:0%
here in the us than we ever have before
 
02:03:13.750 --> 02:03:13.760 align:start position:0%
and i think it helps me feel more
 
02:03:15.910 --> 02:03:15.920 align:start position:0%
confident that when we look for trends
 
02:03:18.070 --> 02:03:18.080 align:start position:0%
we have that information from what we're
 
02:03:20.310 --> 02:03:20.320 align:start position:0%
doing here in the united states i have
 
02:03:22.950 --> 02:03:22.960 align:start position:0%
often uh related
 
02:03:24.470 --> 02:03:24.480 align:start position:0%
referred my patients back to some of the
 
02:03:26.470 --> 02:03:26.480 align:start position:0%
scandinavian studies where they collect
 
02:03:28.390 --> 02:03:28.400 align:start position:0%
data very differently
 
02:03:30.550 --> 02:03:30.560 align:start position:0%
in terms of being able to search their
 
02:03:33.669 --> 02:03:33.679 align:start position:0%
medical record directly as part of how
 
02:03:35.589 --> 02:03:35.599 align:start position:0%
their health care system works
 
02:03:37.750 --> 02:03:37.760 align:start position:0%
where they can collect data
 
02:03:40.070 --> 02:03:40.080 align:start position:0%
in real time and look retrospectively
 
02:03:41.189 --> 02:03:41.199 align:start position:0%
more easily
 
02:03:43.270 --> 02:03:43.280 align:start position:0%
but i really think that the v safe data
 
02:03:46.070 --> 02:03:46.080 align:start position:0%
collection has allowed much easier
 
02:03:48.709 --> 02:03:48.719 align:start position:0%
accessibility and cut down those levels
 
02:03:50.229 --> 02:03:50.239 align:start position:0%
of communication so that we've had
 
02:03:53.109 --> 02:03:53.119 align:start position:0%
better ongoing tracking of
 
02:03:56.229 --> 02:03:56.239 align:start position:0%
expected and unexpected side effects
 
02:03:58.069 --> 02:03:58.079 align:start position:0%
so what you see is what you measure so i
 
02:04:00.149 --> 02:04:00.159 align:start position:0%
appreciate that yeah when i had worked
 
02:04:01.589 --> 02:04:01.599 align:start position:0%
with the drug-eluting stents they
 
02:04:03.589 --> 02:04:03.599 align:start position:0%
started stunting everything with it once
 
02:04:05.030 --> 02:04:05.040 align:start position:0%
they had a coating so you didn't need
 
02:04:07.189 --> 02:04:07.199 align:start position:0%
the therapy but unfortunately once you
 
02:04:08.950 --> 02:04:08.960 align:start position:0%
got off aspirin people started dying
 
02:04:10.629 --> 02:04:10.639 align:start position:0%
from heart attacks because they thought
 
02:04:13.270 --> 02:04:13.280 align:start position:0%
it was this fantastic situation with an
 
02:04:15.910 --> 02:04:15.920 align:start position:0%
unexpected late side effect and sweden
 
02:04:17.990 --> 02:04:18.000 align:start position:0%
is fantastic i definitely appreciate all
 
02:04:19.790 --> 02:04:19.800 align:start position:0%
the epidemic
 
02:04:21.910 --> 02:04:21.920 align:start position:0%
epidemiological data that we get from
 
02:04:24.310 --> 02:04:24.320 align:start position:0%
sweden since they they collect so much
 
02:04:26.310 --> 02:04:26.320 align:start position:0%
information and but we do have some
 
02:04:28.950 --> 02:04:28.960 align:start position:0%
signals there from that population that
 
02:04:31.510 --> 02:04:31.520 align:start position:0%
do put some people at it at pause
 
02:04:34.310 --> 02:04:34.320 align:start position:0%
especially for their sons um but i think
 
02:04:36.069 --> 02:04:36.079 align:start position:0%
that i think it's fantastic they're
 
02:04:38.149 --> 02:04:38.159 align:start position:0%
available for people so thank you you're
 
02:04:38.159 --> 02:04:41.669 align:start position:0%
available for people so thank you you're
welcome

02:04:41.669 --> 02:04:41.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:44.229 --> 02:04:44.239 align:start position:0%
any other questions of the committee
 
02:04:45.430 --> 02:04:45.440 align:start position:0%
if you just follow up with me on the
 
02:04:46.790 --> 02:04:46.800 align:start position:0%
informed consent question i appreciate
 
02:04:49.350 --> 02:04:49.360 align:start position:0%
it and thank you very much thank you
 
02:04:51.430 --> 02:04:51.440 align:start position:0%
i think that oplc show up we had
 
02:04:52.950 --> 02:04:52.960 align:start position:0%
somebody who called me last night said
 
02:04:54.069 --> 02:04:54.079 align:start position:0%
they were going to be here today from
 
02:05:00.149 --> 02:05:00.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:00.159 --> 02:05:01.510 align:start position:0%
 
and

02:05:01.510 --> 02:05:01.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:05:04.310 --> 02:05:04.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:06.390 --> 02:05:06.400 align:start position:0%
anybody else who would like to testify
 
02:05:07.990 --> 02:05:08.000 align:start position:0%
for the healthcare or business
 
02:05:08.000 --> 02:05:09.030 align:start position:0%
for the healthcare or business
communities

02:05:09.030 --> 02:05:09.040 align:start position:0%
communities
 
02:05:11.030 --> 02:05:11.040 align:start position:0%
on this topic
 
02:05:11.040 --> 02:05:12.629 align:start position:0%
on this topic
[Music]

02:05:12.629 --> 02:05:12.639 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:05:12.639 --> 02:05:13.750 align:start position:0%
[Music]
okay

02:05:13.750 --> 02:05:13.760 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:05:15.430 --> 02:05:15.440 align:start position:0%
let me move to a general discussion and
 
02:05:16.550 --> 02:05:16.560 align:start position:0%
jeff i'd like i'd like to follow up
 
02:05:18.149 --> 02:05:18.159 align:start position:0%
because i'm interested in just our
 
02:05:20.229 --> 02:05:20.239 align:start position:0%
discussion that was going on and and if
 
02:05:22.870 --> 02:05:22.880 align:start position:0%
we understand if we if we agree and
 
02:05:24.709 --> 02:05:24.719 align:start position:0%
understand as to why this is an issue
 
02:05:26.390 --> 02:05:26.400 align:start position:0%
right relative to
 
02:05:28.229 --> 02:05:28.239 align:start position:0%
um you know again we're not talking
 
02:05:29.750 --> 02:05:29.760 align:start position:0%
about necessarily just the health care
 
02:05:32.390 --> 02:05:32.400 align:start position:0%
field we have you know 1.3 million new
 
02:05:34.390 --> 02:05:34.400 align:start position:0%
hampshire citizens that we're here to
 
02:05:37.350 --> 02:05:37.360 align:start position:0%
represent and discuss and and help
 
02:05:37.360 --> 02:05:39.109 align:start position:0%
represent and discuss and and help
um

02:05:39.109 --> 02:05:39.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:05:40.229 --> 02:05:40.239 align:start position:0%
i guess i'm just interested in your
 
02:05:41.589 --> 02:05:41.599 align:start position:0%
comments as the back and forth that we
 
02:05:43.030 --> 02:05:43.040 align:start position:0%
were having and discussing i don't want
 
02:05:46.950 --> 02:05:46.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:51.990 --> 02:05:52.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:53.830 --> 02:05:53.840 align:start position:0%
we can probably i guess agree to
 
02:05:55.830 --> 02:05:55.840 align:start position:0%
disagree that i'm not sure there's
 
02:05:58.069 --> 02:05:58.079 align:start position:0%
really a fact of coercion in there that
 
02:06:00.310 --> 02:06:00.320 align:start position:0%
there are a number of places where
 
02:06:02.870 --> 02:06:02.880 align:start position:0%
vaccines are required and i'm i just
 
02:06:04.550 --> 02:06:04.560 align:start position:0%
don't see
 
02:06:04.560 --> 02:06:06.629 align:start position:0%
don't see
that

02:06:06.629 --> 02:06:06.639 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:06:09.109 --> 02:06:09.119 align:start position:0%
coming into play
 
02:06:09.119 --> 02:06:10.870 align:start position:0%
coming into play
okay

02:06:10.870 --> 02:06:10.880 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:06:13.910 --> 02:06:13.920 align:start position:0%
any other comments from the committee
 
02:06:17.030 --> 02:06:17.040 align:start position:0%
representative shaw
 
02:06:19.990 --> 02:06:20.000 align:start position:0%
i have a slightly different
 
02:06:21.990 --> 02:06:22.000 align:start position:0%
perspective on that
 
02:06:23.350 --> 02:06:23.360 align:start position:0%
i think that
 
02:06:23.360 --> 02:06:25.109 align:start position:0%
i think that
um

02:06:25.109 --> 02:06:25.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:06:28.229 --> 02:06:28.239 align:start position:0%
a general overall
 
02:06:28.239 --> 02:06:29.430 align:start position:0%
a general overall
mandate

02:06:29.430 --> 02:06:29.440 align:start position:0%
mandate
 
02:06:33.109 --> 02:06:33.119 align:start position:0%
of you must have a vaccination
 
02:06:33.119 --> 02:06:35.109 align:start position:0%
of you must have a vaccination
um

02:06:35.109 --> 02:06:35.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:06:38.229 --> 02:06:38.239 align:start position:0%
has its drawbacks because
 
02:06:41.030 --> 02:06:41.040 align:start position:0%
it's also it's creating
 
02:06:41.040 --> 02:06:43.030 align:start position:0%
it's also it's creating
um

02:06:43.030 --> 02:06:43.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:06:43.040 --> 02:06:44.390 align:start position:0%
um
hardships

02:06:44.390 --> 02:06:44.400 align:start position:0%
hardships
 
02:06:45.990 --> 02:06:46.000 align:start position:0%
for some people
 
02:06:47.830 --> 02:06:47.840 align:start position:0%
it's creating
 
02:06:50.870 --> 02:06:50.880 align:start position:0%
um problems in the workforce it's
 
02:06:50.880 --> 02:06:52.550 align:start position:0%
um problems in the workforce it's
creating

02:06:52.550 --> 02:06:52.560 align:start position:0%
creating
 
02:06:54.550 --> 02:06:54.560 align:start position:0%
divide among
 
02:06:57.589 --> 02:06:57.599 align:start position:0%
families and people
 
02:07:01.510 --> 02:07:01.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:03.510 --> 02:07:03.520 align:start position:0%
a right to choose
 
02:07:06.870 --> 02:07:06.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:09.990 --> 02:07:10.000 align:start position:0%
if a person is not vaccinated and
 
02:07:12.470 --> 02:07:12.480 align:start position:0%
doesn't choose to be vaccinated
 
02:07:14.790 --> 02:07:14.800 align:start position:0%
but they wear a mask and they follow
 
02:07:17.189 --> 02:07:17.199 align:start position:0%
safety protocols
 
02:07:19.669 --> 02:07:19.679 align:start position:0%
the person that they're
 
02:07:23.430 --> 02:07:23.440 align:start position:0%
most endangering is themselves
 
02:07:25.109 --> 02:07:25.119 align:start position:0%
and to me
 
02:07:25.119 --> 02:07:28.709 align:start position:0%
and to me
um

02:07:28.709 --> 02:07:28.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:29.750 --> 02:07:29.760 align:start position:0%
i feel
 
02:07:32.149 --> 02:07:32.159 align:start position:0%
i feel the same way about seat belts i
 
02:07:34.149 --> 02:07:34.159 align:start position:0%
feel the same way about
 
02:07:36.390 --> 02:07:36.400 align:start position:0%
other things like that that
 
02:07:36.400 --> 02:07:37.189 align:start position:0%
other things like that that
you

02:07:37.189 --> 02:07:37.199 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:07:39.589 --> 02:07:39.599 align:start position:0%
if it's your choice
 
02:07:42.229 --> 02:07:42.239 align:start position:0%
if you have someone else in the car it's
 
02:07:44.790 --> 02:07:44.800 align:start position:0%
a different situation maybe you're
 
02:07:46.709 --> 02:07:46.719 align:start position:0%
you know you're creating a problem for
 
02:07:48.310 --> 02:07:48.320 align:start position:0%
that person
 
02:07:48.320 --> 02:07:49.589 align:start position:0%
that person
but

02:07:49.589 --> 02:07:49.599 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:07:51.510 --> 02:07:51.520 align:start position:0%
i i
 
02:07:55.669 --> 02:07:55.679 align:start position:0%
there's so many unknowns even a doctor
 
02:07:58.629 --> 02:07:58.639 align:start position:0%
will tell you in a conversation
 
02:08:00.950 --> 02:08:00.960 align:start position:0%
that there are still
 
02:08:03.350 --> 02:08:03.360 align:start position:0%
a lot of unanswered questions
 
02:08:06.069 --> 02:08:06.079 align:start position:0%
about the vaccine
 
02:08:11.189 --> 02:08:11.199 align:start position:0%
um it hasn't been in effect long enough
 
02:08:14.790 --> 02:08:14.800 align:start position:0%
to really make long-term decisions
 
02:08:17.669 --> 02:08:17.679 align:start position:0%
a vaccine like pooping for whooping
 
02:08:21.109 --> 02:08:21.119 align:start position:0%
cough and pertussis and measles mumps
 
02:08:24.069 --> 02:08:24.079 align:start position:0%
pox those those vaccines that the kids
 
02:08:24.079 --> 02:08:25.189 align:start position:0%
pox those those vaccines that the kids
get

02:08:25.189 --> 02:08:25.199 align:start position:0%
get
 
02:08:29.030 --> 02:08:29.040 align:start position:0%
uh are proven over
 
02:08:30.709 --> 02:08:30.719 align:start position:0%
10 12
 
02:08:32.550 --> 02:08:32.560 align:start position:0%
14 years
 
02:08:35.430 --> 02:08:35.440 align:start position:0%
but it took probably 30 years to figure
 
02:08:37.669 --> 02:08:37.679 align:start position:0%
out that
 
02:08:40.069 --> 02:08:40.079 align:start position:0%
measles was coming back on some of the
 
02:08:41.350 --> 02:08:41.360 align:start position:0%
kids that
 
02:08:41.360 --> 02:08:42.950 align:start position:0%
kids that
that

02:08:42.950 --> 02:08:42.960 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:08:45.510 --> 02:08:45.520 align:start position:0%
had been vaccinated so they should have
 
02:08:46.950 --> 02:08:46.960 align:start position:0%
a booster
 
02:08:48.790 --> 02:08:48.800 align:start position:0%
but not
 
02:08:51.750 --> 02:08:51.760 align:start position:0%
in a matter of five months or six months
 
02:08:53.189 --> 02:08:53.199 align:start position:0%
and all of a sudden
 
02:08:57.270 --> 02:08:57.280 align:start position:0%
you know this this is becoming a vaccine
 
02:08:57.280 --> 02:08:58.550 align:start position:0%
you know this this is becoming a vaccine
uh

02:08:58.550 --> 02:08:58.560 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:08:58.560 --> 02:09:00.550 align:start position:0%
uh
mandate

02:09:00.550 --> 02:09:00.560 align:start position:0%
mandate
 
02:09:00.560 --> 02:09:01.669 align:start position:0%
mandate
where

02:09:01.669 --> 02:09:01.679 align:start position:0%
where
 
02:09:01.679 --> 02:09:02.470 align:start position:0%
where
the

02:09:02.470 --> 02:09:02.480 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:09:05.669 --> 02:09:05.679 align:start position:0%
studies and the the
 
02:09:05.679 --> 02:09:07.830 align:start position:0%
studies and the the
progress

02:09:07.830 --> 02:09:07.840 align:start position:0%
progress
 
02:09:11.589 --> 02:09:11.599 align:start position:0%
has not covered enough variety of people
 
02:09:15.350 --> 02:09:15.360 align:start position:0%
some people never get sick
 
02:09:19.189 --> 02:09:19.199 align:start position:0%
no matter what they just don't get sick
 
02:09:21.350 --> 02:09:21.360 align:start position:0%
they've never had vaccines they don't go
 
02:09:22.870 --> 02:09:22.880 align:start position:0%
to a doctor
 
02:09:24.870 --> 02:09:24.880 align:start position:0%
and they're fine
 
02:09:26.629 --> 02:09:26.639 align:start position:0%
other people
 
02:09:29.750 --> 02:09:29.760 align:start position:0%
go to doctors they they're constantly
 
02:09:29.760 --> 02:09:30.709 align:start position:0%
go to doctors they they're constantly
having

02:09:30.709 --> 02:09:30.719 align:start position:0%
having
 
02:09:33.589 --> 02:09:33.599 align:start position:0%
different shots for different things
 
02:09:36.709 --> 02:09:36.719 align:start position:0%
because they know that their body
 
02:09:39.589 --> 02:09:39.599 align:start position:0%
is susceptible because they have a
 
02:09:41.910 --> 02:09:41.920 align:start position:0%
an immune system that's that's
 
02:09:41.920 --> 02:09:43.430 align:start position:0%
an immune system that's that's
compromised

02:09:43.430 --> 02:09:43.440 align:start position:0%
compromised
 
02:09:45.030 --> 02:09:45.040 align:start position:0%
but they
 
02:09:47.109 --> 02:09:47.119 align:start position:0%
have a choice
 
02:09:49.830 --> 02:09:49.840 align:start position:0%
to make that decision
 
02:09:49.840 --> 02:09:50.790 align:start position:0%
to make that decision
and

02:09:50.790 --> 02:09:50.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:09:53.830 --> 02:09:53.840 align:start position:0%
that's where i have a problem
 
02:09:53.840 --> 02:09:55.189 align:start position:0%
that's where i have a problem
with

02:09:55.189 --> 02:09:55.199 align:start position:0%
with
 
02:09:57.430 --> 02:09:57.440 align:start position:0%
a mandate
 
02:09:58.830 --> 02:09:58.840 align:start position:0%
i think a
 
02:10:03.910 --> 02:10:03.920 align:start position:0%
suggested the suggested safety measures
 
02:10:06.709 --> 02:10:06.719 align:start position:0%
are the where we should have stopped and
 
02:10:09.750 --> 02:10:09.760 align:start position:0%
not gone with a mandate
 
02:10:12.069 --> 02:10:12.079 align:start position:0%
for employment
 
02:10:14.950 --> 02:10:14.960 align:start position:0%
if you work in a specific
 
02:10:14.960 --> 02:10:16.069 align:start position:0%
if you work in a specific
um

02:10:16.069 --> 02:10:16.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:10:18.470 --> 02:10:18.480 align:start position:0%
type of an environment
 
02:10:21.350 --> 02:10:21.360 align:start position:0%
and part of the
 
02:10:22.790 --> 02:10:22.800 align:start position:0%
and you know
 
02:10:25.430 --> 02:10:25.440 align:start position:0%
as part of your job
 
02:10:28.470 --> 02:10:28.480 align:start position:0%
that you need to have
 
02:10:30.950 --> 02:10:30.960 align:start position:0%
x y and z
 
02:10:34.069 --> 02:10:34.079 align:start position:0%
and you take that job knowing this
 
02:10:36.069 --> 02:10:36.079 align:start position:0%
that's a different story
 
02:10:38.069 --> 02:10:38.079 align:start position:0%
but when you
 
02:10:39.910 --> 02:10:39.920 align:start position:0%
are in a
 
02:10:39.920 --> 02:10:41.669 align:start position:0%
are in a
position

02:10:41.669 --> 02:10:41.679 align:start position:0%
position
 
02:10:41.679 --> 02:10:43.189 align:start position:0%
position
as

02:10:43.189 --> 02:10:43.199 align:start position:0%
as
 
02:10:47.430 --> 02:10:47.440 align:start position:0%
a legislature legislator as a
 
02:10:47.440 --> 02:10:49.430 align:start position:0%
a legislature legislator as a
um

02:10:49.430 --> 02:10:49.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:10:49.440 --> 02:10:51.350 align:start position:0%
um
just

02:10:51.350 --> 02:10:51.360 align:start position:0%
just
 
02:10:53.750 --> 02:10:53.760 align:start position:0%
i i can't think of other
 
02:10:53.760 --> 02:10:54.950 align:start position:0%
i i can't think of other
positions

02:10:54.950 --> 02:10:54.960 align:start position:0%
positions
 
02:10:58.069 --> 02:10:58.079 align:start position:0%
at the moment but that's irrelevant it's
 
02:10:59.109 --> 02:10:59.119 align:start position:0%
it's a
 
02:11:02.149 --> 02:11:02.159 align:start position:0%
a violent something that should be
 
02:11:02.159 --> 02:11:03.830 align:start position:0%
a violent something that should be
voluntary

02:11:03.830 --> 02:11:03.840 align:start position:0%
voluntary
 
02:11:07.350 --> 02:11:07.360 align:start position:0%
according to a person's choice
 
02:11:10.390 --> 02:11:10.400 align:start position:0%
and i feel strongly about that
 
02:11:13.189 --> 02:11:13.199 align:start position:0%
and i i think if you are
 
02:11:13.199 --> 02:11:14.229 align:start position:0%
and i i think if you are
uh

02:11:14.229 --> 02:11:14.239 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:11:17.910 --> 02:11:17.920 align:start position:0%
some people just choose to avoid
 
02:11:19.910 --> 02:11:19.920 align:start position:0%
other people
 
02:11:22.069 --> 02:11:22.079 align:start position:0%
and they don't want to get a vaccine but
 
02:11:23.830 --> 02:11:23.840 align:start position:0%
they don't go anywhere they stay
 
02:11:26.709 --> 02:11:26.719 align:start position:0%
isolated in their home and they might be
 
02:11:28.310 --> 02:11:28.320 align:start position:0%
retired or
 
02:11:30.149 --> 02:11:30.159 align:start position:0%
or something like that
 
02:11:30.159 --> 02:11:31.350 align:start position:0%
or something like that
so

02:11:31.350 --> 02:11:31.360 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:11:33.910 --> 02:11:33.920 align:start position:0%
and and i don't see how an unvaccinated
 
02:11:33.920 --> 02:11:35.030 align:start position:0%
and and i don't see how an unvaccinated
person

02:11:35.030 --> 02:11:35.040 align:start position:0%
person
 
02:11:36.069 --> 02:11:36.079 align:start position:0%
can be
 
02:11:38.950 --> 02:11:38.960 align:start position:0%
any more of a threat than a person who's
 
02:11:41.270 --> 02:11:41.280 align:start position:0%
vaccinated because of
 
02:11:41.280 --> 02:11:42.390 align:start position:0%
vaccinated because of
breakthrough

02:11:42.390 --> 02:11:42.400 align:start position:0%
breakthrough
 
02:11:42.400 --> 02:11:43.669 align:start position:0%
breakthrough
cases

02:11:43.669 --> 02:11:43.679 align:start position:0%
cases
 
02:11:45.430 --> 02:11:45.440 align:start position:0%
that have come from people who are
 
02:11:45.440 --> 02:11:47.030 align:start position:0%
that have come from people who are
vaccinated

02:11:47.030 --> 02:11:47.040 align:start position:0%
vaccinated
 
02:11:50.470 --> 02:11:50.480 align:start position:0%
and that's just my opinion and uh i had
 
02:11:50.480 --> 02:11:51.270 align:start position:0%
and that's just my opinion and uh i had
it

02:11:51.270 --> 02:11:51.280 align:start position:0%
it
 
02:11:53.430 --> 02:11:53.440 align:start position:0%
it was my own fault i didn't get the
 
02:11:53.440 --> 02:11:54.709 align:start position:0%
it was my own fault i didn't get the
vaccine

02:11:54.709 --> 02:11:54.719 align:start position:0%
vaccine
 
02:11:56.709 --> 02:11:56.719 align:start position:0%
and but
 
02:11:58.870 --> 02:11:58.880 align:start position:0%
i never had a flu shot
 
02:12:01.109 --> 02:12:01.119 align:start position:0%
in my life
 
02:12:04.709 --> 02:12:04.719 align:start position:0%
one time i decided to do it
 
02:12:08.149 --> 02:12:08.159 align:start position:0%
and i had the worst winter of my life in
 
02:12:12.470 --> 02:12:12.480 align:start position:0%
illness because my body doesn't need it
 
02:12:13.669 --> 02:12:13.679 align:start position:0%
and and
 
02:12:15.990 --> 02:12:16.000 align:start position:0%
in this particular case
 
02:12:19.430 --> 02:12:19.440 align:start position:0%
i had had an operation last summer
 
02:12:22.229 --> 02:12:22.239 align:start position:0%
and i had internal bleeding created a
 
02:12:24.950 --> 02:12:24.960 align:start position:0%
problem with my body that i wasn't used
 
02:12:26.390 --> 02:12:26.400 align:start position:0%
to i never
 
02:12:29.109 --> 02:12:29.119 align:start position:0%
never had any type of thing like that
 
02:12:30.149 --> 02:12:30.159 align:start position:0%
and then
 
02:12:33.830 --> 02:12:33.840 align:start position:0%
i was run down i had a lot of issues
 
02:12:36.550 --> 02:12:36.560 align:start position:0%
that happened with my normal asthma for
 
02:12:37.830 --> 02:12:37.840 align:start position:0%
a couple months
 
02:12:40.069 --> 02:12:40.079 align:start position:0%
and whammo when i decided i think i'm
 
02:12:41.669 --> 02:12:41.679 align:start position:0%
going to go get the
 
02:12:41.679 --> 02:12:42.950 align:start position:0%
going to go get the
vaccine

02:12:42.950 --> 02:12:42.960 align:start position:0%
vaccine
 
02:12:45.669 --> 02:12:45.679 align:start position:0%
i got it before i had to chance so i had
 
02:12:47.109 --> 02:12:47.119 align:start position:0%
to deal with it
 
02:12:49.830 --> 02:12:49.840 align:start position:0%
but i fought it and i was lucky and god
 
02:12:52.470 --> 02:12:52.480 align:start position:0%
decided he wasn't i wasn't ready
 
02:12:54.550 --> 02:12:54.560 align:start position:0%
for my eternal life and i was happy
 
02:12:55.830 --> 02:12:55.840 align:start position:0%
about that
 
02:12:57.830 --> 02:12:57.840 align:start position:0%
and um but
 
02:13:00.950 --> 02:13:00.960 align:start position:0%
i still think it's choice and i made
 
02:13:03.430 --> 02:13:03.440 align:start position:0%
that choice i made a wrong choice at the
 
02:13:03.440 --> 02:13:04.390 align:start position:0%
that choice i made a wrong choice at the
time

02:13:04.390 --> 02:13:04.400 align:start position:0%
time
 
02:13:06.470 --> 02:13:06.480 align:start position:0%
now i'm having problems
 
02:13:10.149 --> 02:13:10.159 align:start position:0%
were be worrying about being up here
 
02:13:12.629 --> 02:13:12.639 align:start position:0%
and having to have a mandate that in
 
02:13:15.109 --> 02:13:15.119 align:start position:0%
order to be in the legislature you have
 
02:13:16.950 --> 02:13:16.960 align:start position:0%
to have a shot and i don't know if i
 
02:13:18.790 --> 02:13:18.800 align:start position:0%
want it yet
 
02:13:20.470 --> 02:13:20.480 align:start position:0%
the when i heard
 
02:13:23.830 --> 02:13:23.840 align:start position:0%
the doctor she's gone now she she
 
02:13:23.840 --> 02:13:25.109 align:start position:0%
the doctor she's gone now she she
mentioned

02:13:25.109 --> 02:13:25.119 align:start position:0%
mentioned
 
02:13:25.119 --> 02:13:26.390 align:start position:0%
mentioned
um

02:13:26.390 --> 02:13:26.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:13:26.400 --> 02:13:28.310 align:start position:0%
um
that

02:13:28.310 --> 02:13:28.320 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:13:30.229 --> 02:13:30.239 align:start position:0%
gave me a different perspective about
 
02:13:33.350 --> 02:13:33.360 align:start position:0%
the vaccine because she said that
 
02:13:36.390 --> 02:13:36.400 align:start position:0%
the vaccine itself which i have been
 
02:13:36.400 --> 02:13:37.669 align:start position:0%
the vaccine itself which i have been
thinking

02:13:37.669 --> 02:13:37.679 align:start position:0%
thinking
 
02:13:39.270 --> 02:13:39.280 align:start position:0%
had been only
 
02:13:39.280 --> 02:13:40.229 align:start position:0%
had been only
um

02:13:40.229 --> 02:13:40.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:13:43.589 --> 02:13:43.599 align:start position:0%
you know studied for a few months
 
02:13:45.669 --> 02:13:45.679 align:start position:0%
actually had been studied for quite a
 
02:13:49.109 --> 02:13:49.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:51.270 --> 02:13:51.280 align:start position:0%
one thing that wasn't
 
02:13:54.229 --> 02:13:54.239 align:start position:0%
in there was the particular protein
 
02:13:56.310 --> 02:13:56.320 align:start position:0%
that was going to
 
02:13:59.990 --> 02:14:00.000 align:start position:0%
affect this particular virus and that's
 
02:14:02.069 --> 02:14:02.079 align:start position:0%
what they had to come up with and they
 
02:14:04.629 --> 02:14:04.639 align:start position:0%
did but they had already had
 
02:14:04.639 --> 02:14:05.510 align:start position:0%
did but they had already had
a

02:14:05.510 --> 02:14:05.520 align:start position:0%
a
 
02:14:08.229 --> 02:14:08.239 align:start position:0%
one for sars mrsa
 
02:14:09.910 --> 02:14:09.920 align:start position:0%
you know things like that but were not
 
02:14:11.589 --> 02:14:11.599 align:start position:0%
as widespread
 
02:14:14.149 --> 02:14:14.159 align:start position:0%
as the cloven 19 became so that's an
 
02:14:18.069 --> 02:14:18.079 align:start position:0%
interesting point but i've also read in
 
02:14:21.030 --> 02:14:21.040 align:start position:0%
from medical doctors in europe
 
02:14:21.040 --> 02:14:22.390 align:start position:0%
from medical doctors in europe
who

02:14:22.390 --> 02:14:22.400 align:start position:0%
who
 
02:14:24.950 --> 02:14:24.960 align:start position:0%
say that there are
 
02:14:24.960 --> 02:14:26.470 align:start position:0%
say that there are
effects

02:14:26.470 --> 02:14:26.480 align:start position:0%
effects
 
02:14:30.310 --> 02:14:30.320 align:start position:0%
that that up to at least 12 months
 
02:14:33.669 --> 02:14:33.679 align:start position:0%
of immunity for people who have had
 
02:14:36.470 --> 02:14:36.480 align:start position:0%
coveted with their antibodies to prevent
 
02:14:38.229 --> 02:14:38.239 align:start position:0%
them from
 
02:14:40.629 --> 02:14:40.639 align:start position:0%
getting the the disease and if they do
 
02:14:43.430 --> 02:14:43.440 align:start position:0%
get it again it would be a lesser
 
02:14:43.440 --> 02:14:44.629 align:start position:0%
get it again it would be a lesser
um

02:14:44.629 --> 02:14:44.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:14:44.639 --> 02:14:45.589 align:start position:0%
um
case

02:14:45.589 --> 02:14:45.599 align:start position:0%
case
 
02:14:48.390 --> 02:14:48.400 align:start position:0%
in the case of kids going to school
 
02:14:48.400 --> 02:14:49.589 align:start position:0%
in the case of kids going to school
those

02:14:49.589 --> 02:14:49.599 align:start position:0%
those
 
02:14:49.599 --> 02:14:50.709 align:start position:0%
those
those

02:14:50.709 --> 02:14:50.719 align:start position:0%
those
 
02:14:50.719 --> 02:14:53.669 align:start position:0%
those
uh

02:14:53.669 --> 02:14:53.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:53.679 --> 02:14:55.189 align:start position:0%
 
vaccines

02:14:55.189 --> 02:14:55.199 align:start position:0%
vaccines
 
02:14:59.270 --> 02:14:59.280 align:start position:0%
had years and years and years of study
 
02:15:03.350 --> 02:15:03.360 align:start position:0%
before they were mandated in the schools
 
02:15:06.870 --> 02:15:06.880 align:start position:0%
and i would not want them to go away
 
02:15:08.709 --> 02:15:08.719 align:start position:0%
and and because i think they're
 
02:15:12.390 --> 02:15:12.400 align:start position:0%
important um those diseases are not fun
 
02:15:14.950 --> 02:15:14.960 align:start position:0%
to go through and i was in a generation
 
02:15:17.589 --> 02:15:17.599 align:start position:0%
that didn't get those shots and had
 
02:15:19.589 --> 02:15:19.599 align:start position:0%
everything from the whooping cough all
 
02:15:22.149 --> 02:15:22.159 align:start position:0%
the way up to chickenpox just name it i
 
02:15:23.350 --> 02:15:23.360 align:start position:0%
had it
 
02:15:26.310 --> 02:15:26.320 align:start position:0%
but i so i just think
 
02:15:27.990 --> 02:15:28.000 align:start position:0%
that um
 
02:15:32.550 --> 02:15:32.560 align:start position:0%
you know having a just a blanket mandate
 
02:15:34.390 --> 02:15:34.400 align:start position:0%
from the federal government
 
02:15:35.750 --> 02:15:35.760 align:start position:0%
is wrong
 
02:15:38.229 --> 02:15:38.239 align:start position:0%
and i and i think that it should be left
 
02:15:39.350 --> 02:15:39.360 align:start position:0%
up to
 
02:15:39.360 --> 02:15:40.310 align:start position:0%
up to
the

02:15:40.310 --> 02:15:40.320 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:15:40.320 --> 02:15:41.189 align:start position:0%
the
um

02:15:41.189 --> 02:15:41.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:15:42.629 --> 02:15:42.639 align:start position:0%
the individual
 
02:15:44.790 --> 02:15:44.800 align:start position:0%
uh companies
 
02:15:48.390 --> 02:15:48.400 align:start position:0%
and the uh the individuals themselves
 
02:15:49.669 --> 02:15:49.679 align:start position:0%
uh to
 
02:15:49.679 --> 02:15:50.870 align:start position:0%
uh to
decide

02:15:50.870 --> 02:15:50.880 align:start position:0%
decide
 
02:15:52.310 --> 02:15:52.320 align:start position:0%
uh what
 
02:15:54.870 --> 02:15:54.880 align:start position:0%
should be required and what should not
 
02:15:57.830 --> 02:15:57.840 align:start position:0%
and not call it a mandate
 
02:15:59.910 --> 02:15:59.920 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you representative
 
02:16:01.750 --> 02:16:01.760 align:start position:0%
i will just make a couple comments
 
02:16:04.229 --> 02:16:04.239 align:start position:0%
relative to you know i'm with you into a
 
02:16:06.229 --> 02:16:06.239 align:start position:0%
certain extent about mandates although
 
02:16:07.109 --> 02:16:07.119 align:start position:0%
you know
 
02:16:08.470 --> 02:16:08.480 align:start position:0%
would it be so that i could wave the
 
02:16:09.669 --> 02:16:09.679 align:start position:0%
magic wand and the federal government
 
02:16:11.430 --> 02:16:11.440 align:start position:0%
would change its policy
 
02:16:13.510 --> 02:16:13.520 align:start position:0%
but that's just not likely to happen
 
02:16:13.520 --> 02:16:14.950 align:start position:0%
but that's just not likely to happen
um

02:16:14.950 --> 02:16:14.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:16:16.629 --> 02:16:16.639 align:start position:0%
the the one thing that's interesting is
 
02:16:18.069 --> 02:16:18.079 align:start position:0%
and i want to call a couple of tensions
 
02:16:19.910 --> 02:16:19.920 align:start position:0%
as people looking at data and talking
 
02:16:22.390 --> 02:16:22.400 align:start position:0%
about this topic is that
 
02:16:24.390 --> 02:16:24.400 align:start position:0%
in recent news we've heard that the the
 
02:16:27.430 --> 02:16:27.440 align:start position:0%
dashboard for the dhhs has some problems
 
02:16:28.470 --> 02:16:28.480 align:start position:0%
if you look at the number of
 
02:16:30.870 --> 02:16:30.880 align:start position:0%
vaccinations reported
 
02:16:33.830 --> 02:16:33.840 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire is 800 000 and change
 
02:16:35.270 --> 02:16:35.280 align:start position:0%
if you look at the new hampshire state
 
02:16:37.110 --> 02:16:37.120 align:start position:0%
website however if you look at the cdc
 
02:16:39.349 --> 02:16:39.359 align:start position:0%
website which commissioner shibanet said
 
02:16:41.190 --> 02:16:41.200 align:start position:0%
is more accurate because of reporting
 
02:16:41.200 --> 02:16:42.230 align:start position:0%
is more accurate because of reporting
issues

02:16:42.230 --> 02:16:42.240 align:start position:0%
issues
 
02:16:43.750 --> 02:16:43.760 align:start position:0%
it's over a million people in new
 
02:16:45.509 --> 02:16:45.519 align:start position:0%
hampshire have already been vaccinated
 
02:16:46.870 --> 02:16:46.880 align:start position:0%
to some degree
 
02:16:48.950 --> 02:16:48.960 align:start position:0%
and so the interesting part about this
 
02:16:51.429 --> 02:16:51.439 align:start position:0%
conversation is the fact that
 
02:16:53.589 --> 02:16:53.599 align:start position:0%
prior to covet new hampshire was one of
 
02:16:56.070 --> 02:16:56.080 align:start position:0%
the most immunized states in the country
 
02:16:58.070 --> 02:16:58.080 align:start position:0%
because people just chose to right they
 
02:16:59.509 --> 02:16:59.519 align:start position:0%
lived for united states they made their
 
02:17:01.750 --> 02:17:01.760 align:start position:0%
decision they chose to get it and it's
 
02:17:03.750 --> 02:17:03.760 align:start position:0%
only now that we're having dissent and
 
02:17:05.990 --> 02:17:06.000 align:start position:0%
and and concerned because we're now
 
02:17:07.910 --> 02:17:07.920 align:start position:0%
forcing where we've never done that
 
02:17:09.910 --> 02:17:09.920 align:start position:0%
before you know to a certain extent i i
 
02:17:12.150 --> 02:17:12.160 align:start position:0%
know that it's a very bad analogy and i
 
02:17:13.110 --> 02:17:13.120 align:start position:0%
probably shouldn't use it but it's the
 
02:17:14.389 --> 02:17:14.399 align:start position:0%
petulant child thing where we're
 
02:17:15.990 --> 02:17:16.000 align:start position:0%
stomping your feet right wait i would
 
02:17:17.030 --> 02:17:17.040 align:start position:0%
have done i would have cleaned my room
 
02:17:18.150 --> 02:17:18.160 align:start position:0%
anyway but now i'm not going to do it
 
02:17:19.589 --> 02:17:19.599 align:start position:0%
because you told me to do it right and
 
02:17:20.870 --> 02:17:20.880 align:start position:0%
so we're having a little bit of that
 
02:17:22.950 --> 02:17:22.960 align:start position:0%
going on right
 
02:17:24.070 --> 02:17:24.080 align:start position:0%
and so
 
02:17:26.389 --> 02:17:26.399 align:start position:0%
uh you know i guess this conversation is
 
02:17:28.230 --> 02:17:28.240 align:start position:0%
happening around that is that we've had
 
02:17:30.150 --> 02:17:30.160 align:start position:0%
it's never been stigmatized before if
 
02:17:31.589 --> 02:17:31.599 align:start position:0%
you chose not to
 
02:17:33.349 --> 02:17:33.359 align:start position:0%
right and now we're stigmatizing it
 
02:17:35.589 --> 02:17:35.599 align:start position:0%
right in this in the state but now we're
 
02:17:39.990 --> 02:17:40.000 align:start position:0%
calling it out and we're where you know
 
02:17:42.070 --> 02:17:42.080 align:start position:0%
and that is of concern as we as we
 
02:17:44.870 --> 02:17:44.880 align:start position:0%
divide up our population right into the
 
02:17:46.870 --> 02:17:46.880 align:start position:0%
haves and have-nots you got it i don't
 
02:17:48.549 --> 02:17:48.559 align:start position:0%
i'm not you know therefore i'm not going
 
02:17:50.549 --> 02:17:50.559 align:start position:0%
to do this so you can't do that right
 
02:17:51.910 --> 02:17:51.920 align:start position:0%
and so that's around some of these
 
02:17:53.830 --> 02:17:53.840 align:start position:0%
discussion points we're having right now
 
02:17:56.469 --> 02:17:56.479 align:start position:0%
is is the the it's never been an issue
 
02:17:58.629 --> 02:17:58.639 align:start position:0%
before in immunization right is that
 
02:18:00.309 --> 02:18:00.319 align:start position:0%
we've always had a high
 
02:18:02.309 --> 02:18:02.319 align:start position:0%
i hate to use the word compliance but
 
02:18:03.830 --> 02:18:03.840 align:start position:0%
voluntary compliance with getting
 
02:18:03.840 --> 02:18:05.190 align:start position:0%
voluntary compliance with getting
vaccinations

02:18:05.190 --> 02:18:05.200 align:start position:0%
vaccinations
 
02:18:07.030 --> 02:18:07.040 align:start position:0%
and now we're seeing pushback right
 
02:18:09.030 --> 02:18:09.040 align:start position:0%
because even the people that before
 
02:18:10.790 --> 02:18:10.800 align:start position:0%
we've accepted the fact that they chose
 
02:18:13.349 --> 02:18:13.359 align:start position:0%
not to get the flu shot or get whatever
 
02:18:15.429 --> 02:18:15.439 align:start position:0%
other shots are out there that are done
 
02:18:16.950 --> 02:18:16.960 align:start position:0%
um i was asked the other day was the
 
02:18:19.669 --> 02:18:19.679 align:start position:0%
last shot i got i couldn't remember um
 
02:18:20.870 --> 02:18:20.880 align:start position:0%
you know because it's not something i
 
02:18:22.389 --> 02:18:22.399 align:start position:0%
even think about i think that's true for
 
02:18:23.750 --> 02:18:23.760 align:start position:0%
most people they don't think about the
 
02:18:25.110 --> 02:18:25.120 align:start position:0%
last time they got a shot or an
 
02:18:26.469 --> 02:18:26.479 align:start position:0%
immunization unless they're standing in
 
02:18:28.309 --> 02:18:28.319 align:start position:0%
their doctor's office but now we're
 
02:18:30.150 --> 02:18:30.160 align:start position:0%
calling it front and center and it's
 
02:18:32.469 --> 02:18:32.479 align:start position:0%
dividing our state it's dividing our
 
02:18:34.950 --> 02:18:34.960 align:start position:0%
citizens right and and and we can either
 
02:18:37.509 --> 02:18:37.519 align:start position:0%
stand by as legislators and do nothing
 
02:18:38.950 --> 02:18:38.960 align:start position:0%
right or we can try to figure out what
 
02:18:41.429 --> 02:18:41.439 align:start position:0%
the fix is you know so again where
 
02:18:43.270 --> 02:18:43.280 align:start position:0%
where can we make it easier for our
 
02:18:45.589 --> 02:18:45.599 align:start position:0%
citizens to get along through and deal
 
02:18:47.669 --> 02:18:47.679 align:start position:0%
with these mandates right and so in
 
02:18:49.589 --> 02:18:49.599 align:start position:0%
terms of businesses you know i i want i
 
02:18:51.190 --> 02:18:51.200 align:start position:0%
don't want businesses to be put between
 
02:18:53.190 --> 02:18:53.200 align:start position:0%
a rock and a hard spot you know where
 
02:18:54.790 --> 02:18:54.800 align:start position:0%
they're dealing with i got a federal
 
02:18:56.309 --> 02:18:56.319 align:start position:0%
mandate and i got a workforce and
 
02:18:58.629 --> 02:18:58.639 align:start position:0%
they're they're there at odds with each
 
02:18:58.639 --> 02:18:59.429 align:start position:0%
they're they're there at odds with each
other

02:18:59.429 --> 02:18:59.439 align:start position:0%
other
 
02:19:01.030 --> 02:19:01.040 align:start position:0%
right so how can us as a state
 
02:19:03.990 --> 02:19:04.000 align:start position:0%
legislator legislature fix that right
 
02:19:05.589 --> 02:19:05.599 align:start position:0%
how can we ease that odds so the
 
02:19:07.429 --> 02:19:07.439 align:start position:0%
workforce and the businesses can just go
 
02:19:10.070 --> 02:19:10.080 align:start position:0%
about doing their business right without
 
02:19:12.870 --> 02:19:12.880 align:start position:0%
these uh without a workforce issue right
 
02:19:15.110 --> 02:19:15.120 align:start position:0%
and so you know and jeff back to your
 
02:19:17.750 --> 02:19:17.760 align:start position:0%
point where before it was all voluntary
 
02:19:19.910 --> 02:19:19.920 align:start position:0%
right it's no longer voluntary so the
 
02:19:21.429 --> 02:19:21.439 align:start position:0%
ones that had the mandates don't feel
 
02:19:22.950 --> 02:19:22.960 align:start position:0%
any change but the ones that didn't have
 
02:19:24.469 --> 02:19:24.479 align:start position:0%
the mandates are feeling changed and
 
02:19:25.669 --> 02:19:25.679 align:start position:0%
there may have been a
 
02:19:27.270 --> 02:19:27.280 align:start position:0%
a strong business reason because they
 
02:19:29.429 --> 02:19:29.439 align:start position:0%
knew they had a population of workers
 
02:19:31.750 --> 02:19:31.760 align:start position:0%
that were that didn't want to get the
 
02:19:33.429 --> 02:19:33.439 align:start position:0%
vaccine and they chose not to do a
 
02:19:35.910 --> 02:19:35.920 align:start position:0%
mandate because their workforce it's
 
02:19:37.750 --> 02:19:37.760 align:start position:0%
more important to have the people there
 
02:19:39.190 --> 02:19:39.200 align:start position:0%
than to have the people quit because of
 
02:19:41.589 --> 02:19:41.599 align:start position:0%
a mandate right and so they chose that
 
02:19:43.270 --> 02:19:43.280 align:start position:0%
but now we're not doing not giving them
 
02:19:43.280 --> 02:19:44.150 align:start position:0%
but now we're not doing not giving them
choice

02:19:44.150 --> 02:19:44.160 align:start position:0%
choice
 
02:19:46.629 --> 02:19:46.639 align:start position:0%
and so again it's how can we help our
 
02:19:48.150 --> 02:19:48.160 align:start position:0%
businesses how can we help our doctors
 
02:19:49.590 --> 02:19:49.600 align:start position:0%
again i i'm
 
02:19:51.030 --> 02:19:51.040 align:start position:0%
i'm really worried
 
02:19:52.630 --> 02:19:52.640 align:start position:0%
i i truly am worried about that ethical
 
02:19:54.469 --> 02:19:54.479 align:start position:0%
concern for a doctor right that that the
 
02:19:56.630 --> 02:19:56.640 align:start position:0%
fact that yeah in certain circumstances
 
02:19:58.150 --> 02:19:58.160 align:start position:0%
they were doing it because of a job
 
02:20:00.389 --> 02:20:00.399 align:start position:0%
function and and the employee wanted it
 
02:20:02.870 --> 02:20:02.880 align:start position:0%
but now we're literally firing people
 
02:20:04.550 --> 02:20:04.560 align:start position:0%
that have never been fired before that
 
02:20:06.150 --> 02:20:06.160 align:start position:0%
have been in their job for 20 and 30
 
02:20:07.910 --> 02:20:07.920 align:start position:0%
years but because
 
02:20:10.230 --> 02:20:10.240 align:start position:0%
they refuse to get injected right i mean
 
02:20:11.349 --> 02:20:11.359 align:start position:0%
i probably wouldn't even have this
 
02:20:12.389 --> 02:20:12.399 align:start position:0%
argument if you can tell me how to
 
02:20:14.790 --> 02:20:14.800 align:start position:0%
unvaccinate somebody right but there is
 
02:20:17.110 --> 02:20:17.120 align:start position:0%
no unvaccination right you can't undo
 
02:20:19.110 --> 02:20:19.120 align:start position:0%
what's been done right and so people
 
02:20:21.429 --> 02:20:21.439 align:start position:0%
have a serious legitimate concern in
 
02:20:22.870 --> 02:20:22.880 align:start position:0%
their mind
 
02:20:25.270 --> 02:20:25.280 align:start position:0%
and for us to step into that all right
 
02:20:26.630 --> 02:20:26.640 align:start position:0%
and tell them no i don't care what your
 
02:20:28.469 --> 02:20:28.479 align:start position:0%
legitimate concern is if you want to put
 
02:20:30.230 --> 02:20:30.240 align:start position:0%
food on your table you have to do this
 
02:20:32.150 --> 02:20:32.160 align:start position:0%
right and so and that's a forced
 
02:20:34.150 --> 02:20:34.160 align:start position:0%
situation so again as a legislature i
 
02:20:35.510 --> 02:20:35.520 align:start position:0%
think part of this committee is talking
 
02:20:37.670 --> 02:20:37.680 align:start position:0%
about those kind of things how do we
 
02:20:39.750 --> 02:20:39.760 align:start position:0%
resolve that conflict between our
 
02:20:41.510 --> 02:20:41.520 align:start position:0%
citizens and the mandates and how do we
 
02:20:43.030 --> 02:20:43.040 align:start position:0%
help our businesses and our health care
 
02:20:45.429 --> 02:20:45.439 align:start position:0%
providers right that are stuck between
 
02:20:47.349 --> 02:20:47.359 align:start position:0%
this rock and a hard spot
 
02:20:49.110 --> 02:20:49.120 align:start position:0%
right they gotta comply with the federal
 
02:20:49.120 --> 02:20:50.230 align:start position:0%
right they gotta comply with the federal
mandate

02:20:50.230 --> 02:20:50.240 align:start position:0%
mandate
 
02:20:52.230 --> 02:20:52.240 align:start position:0%
they have a workforce that's resistant
 
02:20:53.670 --> 02:20:53.680 align:start position:0%
and even if it's only ten percent like i
 
02:20:55.270 --> 02:20:55.280 align:start position:0%
said i have manufacturing industry in
 
02:20:57.110 --> 02:20:57.120 align:start position:0%
the lakes region two people two
 
02:20:58.710 --> 02:20:58.720 align:start position:0%
businesses call me saying i'm subject to
 
02:21:00.070 --> 02:21:00.080 align:start position:0%
this thing i'm gonna lose 10 of my
 
02:21:02.309 --> 02:21:02.319 align:start position:0%
workforce if i lose 10 of my workforce i
 
02:21:04.230 --> 02:21:04.240 align:start position:0%
can't meet the federal contracts because
 
02:21:06.070 --> 02:21:06.080 align:start position:0%
i don't have people to hire
 
02:21:08.070 --> 02:21:08.080 align:start position:0%
right and so and
 
02:21:09.429 --> 02:21:09.439 align:start position:0%
what did they do
 
02:21:11.030 --> 02:21:11.040 align:start position:0%
how do they manage that
 
02:21:12.630 --> 02:21:12.640 align:start position:0%
right and and what can we do as a
 
02:21:14.790 --> 02:21:14.800 align:start position:0%
legislator make it easier for them
 
02:21:14.800 --> 02:21:15.830 align:start position:0%
legislator make it easier for them
um

02:21:15.830 --> 02:21:15.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:21:17.190 --> 02:21:17.200 align:start position:0%
so i guess that's why we're having this
 
02:21:18.389 --> 02:21:18.399 align:start position:0%
meeting and i guess that's a you know
 
02:21:20.070 --> 02:21:20.080 align:start position:0%
it's great that senator bradley put the
 
02:21:22.150 --> 02:21:22.160 align:start position:0%
committee on there right not you know i
 
02:21:23.830 --> 02:21:23.840 align:start position:0%
guess i guess he had a little crystal
 
02:21:25.910 --> 02:21:25.920 align:start position:0%
ball he knew this was coming up you know
 
02:21:28.389 --> 02:21:28.399 align:start position:0%
and was able to see what was going on um
 
02:21:30.469 --> 02:21:30.479 align:start position:0%
but you know those are my comments to
 
02:21:32.150 --> 02:21:32.160 align:start position:0%
this is that how do we mitigate this and
 
02:21:35.030 --> 02:21:35.040 align:start position:0%
how do we fix this um i i do think there
 
02:21:36.630 --> 02:21:36.640 align:start position:0%
is a problem myself
 
02:21:38.630 --> 02:21:38.640 align:start position:0%
in how we deal and how our citizens are
 
02:21:40.230 --> 02:21:40.240 align:start position:0%
going to have to deal with this and how
 
02:21:41.750 --> 02:21:41.760 align:start position:0%
our businesses have to deal with this
 
02:21:45.670 --> 02:21:45.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:47.910 --> 02:21:47.920 align:start position:0%
go ahead jeff
 
02:21:49.190 --> 02:21:49.200 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
02:21:50.950 --> 02:21:50.960 align:start position:0%
i just may respond a little bit to that
 
02:21:52.630 --> 02:21:52.640 align:start position:0%
as we talk about
 
02:21:55.540 --> 02:21:55.550 align:start position:0%
executive orders and federal mandates um
 
02:21:55.550 --> 02:21:58.150 align:start position:0%
executive orders and federal mandates um
[Music]

02:21:58.150 --> 02:21:58.160 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:22:00.710 --> 02:22:00.720 align:start position:0%
we heard yesterday
 
02:22:02.550 --> 02:22:02.560 align:start position:0%
that there was very little we could do
 
02:22:04.150 --> 02:22:04.160 align:start position:0%
on a state level with the federal
 
02:22:04.160 --> 02:22:06.230 align:start position:0%
on a state level with the federal
mandate

02:22:06.230 --> 02:22:06.240 align:start position:0%
mandate
 
02:22:08.630 --> 02:22:08.640 align:start position:0%
so the question comes back to
 
02:22:12.550 --> 02:22:12.560 align:start position:0%
if it's a federal mandate i'm not sure
 
02:22:14.710 --> 02:22:14.720 align:start position:0%
what this committee can do on a state
 
02:22:14.720 --> 02:22:16.389 align:start position:0%
what this committee can do on a state
level

02:22:16.389 --> 02:22:16.399 align:start position:0%
level
 
02:22:18.150 --> 02:22:18.160 align:start position:0%
to go around that mandate other than
 
02:22:20.070 --> 02:22:20.080 align:start position:0%
what our attorney general is doing and
 
02:22:23.750 --> 02:22:23.760 align:start position:0%
it's taking it to court or filing
 
02:22:25.910 --> 02:22:25.920 align:start position:0%
in with the other states
 
02:22:28.150 --> 02:22:28.160 align:start position:0%
sure so again i think you heard the
 
02:22:31.270 --> 02:22:31.280 align:start position:0%
attorney general say that or or um and
 
02:22:32.710 --> 02:22:32.720 align:start position:0%
edwards the assistant attorney general
 
02:22:34.389 --> 02:22:34.399 align:start position:0%
who is here says that
 
02:22:37.590 --> 02:22:37.600 align:start position:0%
in a court case the um court in a in a
 
02:22:38.870 --> 02:22:38.880 align:start position:0%
preemptive challenge like this of a
 
02:22:40.630 --> 02:22:40.640 align:start position:0%
supremacy clause looks at the will of
 
02:22:43.110 --> 02:22:43.120 align:start position:0%
the state and by passing a law even if
 
02:22:45.910 --> 02:22:45.920 align:start position:0%
it isn't enforceable it still states the
 
02:22:47.429 --> 02:22:47.439 align:start position:0%
will of the state that we don't believe
 
02:22:49.429 --> 02:22:49.439 align:start position:0%
in federal mandates right and that the
 
02:22:50.550 --> 02:22:50.560 align:start position:0%
court could use that in its
 
02:22:52.550 --> 02:22:52.560 align:start position:0%
determination in in the in their in
 
02:22:54.950 --> 02:22:54.960 align:start position:0%
their case that's what she said right
 
02:22:57.510 --> 02:22:57.520 align:start position:0%
that it does help in that it provides
 
02:22:59.270 --> 02:22:59.280 align:start position:0%
direction to the court as to what the
 
02:23:00.790 --> 02:23:00.800 align:start position:0%
will of the state is
 
02:23:03.670 --> 02:23:03.680 align:start position:0%
right so i i think that even if it's is
 
02:23:06.630 --> 02:23:06.640 align:start position:0%
unenforceable it is useful to the state
 
02:23:08.950 --> 02:23:08.960 align:start position:0%
potentially to pass something right i'll
 
02:23:10.710 --> 02:23:10.720 align:start position:0%
give you another example and it's going
 
02:23:13.429 --> 02:23:13.439 align:start position:0%
to be all self-servings it's my bill but
 
02:23:15.270 --> 02:23:15.280 align:start position:0%
creating an easier exemption clause for
 
02:23:17.590 --> 02:23:17.600 align:start position:0%
businesses right so they're not stuck in
 
02:23:19.510 --> 02:23:19.520 align:start position:0%
this i have to decide whether somebody's
 
02:23:20.710 --> 02:23:20.720 align:start position:0%
religious enough and then i'm gonna have
 
02:23:22.309 --> 02:23:22.319 align:start position:0%
the federal government come in behind me
 
02:23:23.910 --> 02:23:23.920 align:start position:0%
to check to see
 
02:23:26.309 --> 02:23:26.319 align:start position:0%
if i was um
 
02:23:28.389 --> 02:23:28.399 align:start position:0%
uh diligent enough
 
02:23:30.230 --> 02:23:30.240 align:start position:0%
in pursuing these exemptions to make
 
02:23:31.590 --> 02:23:31.600 align:start position:0%
sure they're valid
 
02:23:33.910 --> 02:23:33.920 align:start position:0%
right is that we could pass a simple
 
02:23:36.070 --> 02:23:36.080 align:start position:0%
state law that eases exemptions right
 
02:23:37.590 --> 02:23:37.600 align:start position:0%
that makes it easier for business to
 
02:23:39.349 --> 02:23:39.359 align:start position:0%
provide an exemption so they could still
 
02:23:42.790 --> 02:23:42.800 align:start position:0%
impose a mandate but then still have um
 
02:23:45.110 --> 02:23:45.120 align:start position:0%
have clear law and say that says there's
 
02:23:46.469 --> 02:23:46.479 align:start position:0%
an exemption law in new hampshire i got
 
02:23:48.870 --> 02:23:48.880 align:start position:0%
to follow it so i i did a mandate and
 
02:23:50.870 --> 02:23:50.880 align:start position:0%
but i also followed the state law with
 
02:23:52.710 --> 02:23:52.720 align:start position:0%
the exemptions so they can fix we could
 
02:23:54.230 --> 02:23:54.240 align:start position:0%
fix that make it easier for them to be
 
02:23:55.910 --> 02:23:55.920 align:start position:0%
able to retain workers by allowing for
 
02:23:57.429 --> 02:23:57.439 align:start position:0%
easier exemptions
 
02:23:57.439 --> 02:23:58.469 align:start position:0%
easier exemptions
right

02:23:58.469 --> 02:23:58.479 align:start position:0%
right
 
02:24:01.190 --> 02:24:01.200 align:start position:0%
that would be allowable and so there's a
 
02:24:02.950 --> 02:24:02.960 align:start position:0%
case of we've met the federal mandate
 
02:24:05.110 --> 02:24:05.120 align:start position:0%
and we've met state law so there are
 
02:24:07.429 --> 02:24:07.439 align:start position:0%
places we can go to make it easier for
 
02:24:09.830 --> 02:24:09.840 align:start position:0%
businesses and easier for doctors
 
02:24:12.790 --> 02:24:12.800 align:start position:0%
to manage um so i i think it's it's not
 
02:24:14.070 --> 02:24:14.080 align:start position:0%
like being said well they need us
 
02:24:15.670 --> 02:24:15.680 align:start position:0%
federal government we got to walk away i
 
02:24:17.349 --> 02:24:17.359 align:start position:0%
don't think that's a legitimate answer i
 
02:24:19.590 --> 02:24:19.600 align:start position:0%
think there are places we can fix stuff
 
02:24:22.070 --> 02:24:22.080 align:start position:0%
and that we should follow
 
02:24:23.349 --> 02:24:23.359 align:start position:0%
so i guess that's my answer to your
 
02:24:23.359 --> 02:24:26.309 align:start position:0%
so i guess that's my answer to your
question

02:24:26.309 --> 02:24:26.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:28.389 --> 02:24:28.399 align:start position:0%
of legal thank you mr chairman i agree
 
02:24:30.230 --> 02:24:30.240 align:start position:0%
with that as well my takeaway from the
 
02:24:32.230 --> 02:24:32.240 align:start position:0%
assistant attorney general's comments
 
02:24:35.110 --> 02:24:35.120 align:start position:0%
were that um if it is the will of the
 
02:24:37.590 --> 02:24:37.600 align:start position:0%
legislature in the state that we do
 
02:24:39.349 --> 02:24:39.359 align:start position:0%
provide some protection for these
 
02:24:41.670 --> 02:24:41.680 align:start position:0%
employers and these employees
 
02:24:43.270 --> 02:24:43.280 align:start position:0%
and potentially customers that this
 
02:24:45.670 --> 02:24:45.680 align:start position:0%
extends further but if we allow these
 
02:24:47.270 --> 02:24:47.280 align:start position:0%
protections that then that will help
 
02:24:48.950 --> 02:24:48.960 align:start position:0%
strengthen our case in order to figure
 
02:24:51.349 --> 02:24:51.359 align:start position:0%
out where that line of interaction
 
02:24:53.190 --> 02:24:53.200 align:start position:0%
between the federal and state will end
 
02:24:55.590 --> 02:24:55.600 align:start position:0%
up falling so it's not a head-on
 
02:24:57.030 --> 02:24:57.040 align:start position:0%
challenge to
 
02:24:59.349 --> 02:24:59.359 align:start position:0%
ease ease these challenge these problems
 
02:24:59.359 --> 02:25:00.389 align:start position:0%
ease ease these challenge these problems
because

02:25:00.389 --> 02:25:00.399 align:start position:0%
because
 
02:25:02.630 --> 02:25:02.640 align:start position:0%
we we right now if you've seen any of
 
02:25:04.710 --> 02:25:04.720 align:start position:0%
the religious exemption forms coming
 
02:25:06.710 --> 02:25:06.720 align:start position:0%
especially southwest
 
02:25:08.710 --> 02:25:08.720 align:start position:0%
here's all these answers if you don't
 
02:25:10.230 --> 02:25:10.240 align:start position:0%
answer these completely truthfully
 
02:25:12.150 --> 02:25:12.160 align:start position:0%
you're fired and i'd like to talk to
 
02:25:13.349 --> 02:25:13.359 align:start position:0%
your pastor so i can ask them
 
02:25:15.830 --> 02:25:15.840 align:start position:0%
independently that that may be going too
 
02:25:17.429 --> 02:25:17.439 align:start position:0%
far i know that there's some other
 
02:25:18.870 --> 02:25:18.880 align:start position:0%
places that may be challenged for not
 
02:25:20.230 --> 02:25:20.240 align:start position:0%
going far enough by the federal
 
02:25:22.790 --> 02:25:22.800 align:start position:0%
government and that's a very challenging
 
02:25:25.110 --> 02:25:25.120 align:start position:0%
position for our businesses to be in
 
02:25:29.030 --> 02:25:29.040 align:start position:0%
um we actually the osha law has come out
 
02:25:30.550 --> 02:25:30.560 align:start position:0%
while we've been here in this committee
 
02:25:32.790 --> 02:25:32.800 align:start position:0%
so i'm hopeful that we'll have a chance
 
02:25:35.190 --> 02:25:35.200 align:start position:0%
to maybe hear back at some point i don't
 
02:25:37.590 --> 02:25:37.600 align:start position:0%
know i defer to you mr chairman on that
 
02:25:39.510 --> 02:25:39.520 align:start position:0%
about the interpretation of that osha
 
02:25:41.750 --> 02:25:41.760 align:start position:0%
law and i did want to agree with
 
02:25:43.830 --> 02:25:43.840 align:start position:0%
representative shaw's opinions as well
 
02:25:45.910 --> 02:25:45.920 align:start position:0%
on this i think that that mandating
 
02:25:47.270 --> 02:25:47.280 align:start position:0%
things is a lot different than making
 
02:25:49.910 --> 02:25:49.920 align:start position:0%
them available and encouraged and i want
 
02:25:51.990 --> 02:25:52.000 align:start position:0%
to provide a little bit more backstory
 
02:25:53.590 --> 02:25:53.600 align:start position:0%
on those vaccines
 
02:25:55.190 --> 02:25:55.200 align:start position:0%
there's been a process in order to
 
02:25:56.630 --> 02:25:56.640 align:start position:0%
accelerate them
 
02:25:59.349 --> 02:25:59.359 align:start position:0%
but this is an entirely novel vaccine
 
02:26:02.469 --> 02:26:02.479 align:start position:0%
therapy a new way of doing things
 
02:26:04.309 --> 02:26:04.319 align:start position:0%
if we had stayed with traditional
 
02:26:06.070 --> 02:26:06.080 align:start position:0%
vaccine technologies just not in the
 
02:26:08.309 --> 02:26:08.319 align:start position:0%
amplification of the protein but the
 
02:26:09.590 --> 02:26:09.600 align:start position:0%
whole process it would have been about
 
02:26:12.389 --> 02:26:12.399 align:start position:0%
two years so we still wouldn't have any
 
02:26:14.870 --> 02:26:14.880 align:start position:0%
vaccine available for anybody which
 
02:26:16.950 --> 02:26:16.960 align:start position:0%
would be a tragedy because
 
02:26:18.469 --> 02:26:18.479 align:start position:0%
it's it's a blessing that we have these
 
02:26:20.550 --> 02:26:20.560 align:start position:0%
available to us today but it is still
 
02:26:22.950 --> 02:26:22.960 align:start position:0%
relatively new and and we're finding
 
02:26:25.270 --> 02:26:25.280 align:start position:0%
things out as we go along and i knew i
 
02:26:26.710 --> 02:26:26.720 align:start position:0%
do know that what used to be a
 
02:26:30.950 --> 02:26:30.960 align:start position:0%
relatively small field of virology is uh
 
02:26:32.230 --> 02:26:32.240 align:start position:0%
we're going to have a lot new science
 
02:26:33.750 --> 02:26:33.760 align:start position:0%
and a lot of new scientists who have
 
02:26:35.590 --> 02:26:35.600 align:start position:0%
been inspired by this to bring the next
 
02:26:35.600 --> 02:26:37.750 align:start position:0%
been inspired by this to bring the next
vaccines

02:26:37.750 --> 02:26:37.760 align:start position:0%
vaccines
 
02:26:39.349 --> 02:26:39.359 align:start position:0%
so just to answer your question on the
 
02:26:41.670 --> 02:26:41.680 align:start position:0%
osha thing so yeah the white house just
 
02:26:44.150 --> 02:26:44.160 align:start position:0%
came out with the release of the
 
02:26:46.309 --> 02:26:46.319 align:start position:0%
requirement it says the osha rule
 
02:26:48.870 --> 02:26:48.880 align:start position:0%
requires employers 100 or more to put
 
02:26:50.630 --> 02:26:50.640 align:start position:0%
vaccine requirements in place for all
 
02:26:52.710 --> 02:26:52.720 align:start position:0%
staff or face fines up to fourteen
 
02:26:55.429 --> 02:26:55.439 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars per violation
 
02:26:55.439 --> 02:26:56.790 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars per violation
um

02:26:56.790 --> 02:26:56.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:26:59.349 --> 02:26:59.359 align:start position:0%
additionally they also pushed back the
 
02:27:01.750 --> 02:27:01.760 align:start position:0%
implementation date to january 4th to
 
02:27:03.110 --> 02:27:03.120 align:start position:0%
give a little more breathing room to
 
02:27:04.469 --> 02:27:04.479 align:start position:0%
businesses so
 
02:27:06.389 --> 02:27:06.399 align:start position:0%
um and it was done as part of the
 
02:27:09.670 --> 02:27:09.680 align:start position:0%
emergency temporary standards of osha
 
02:27:11.349 --> 02:27:11.359 align:start position:0%
that they're allowed to do
 
02:27:13.830 --> 02:27:13.840 align:start position:0%
so um so we kind of have a place to look
 
02:27:16.550 --> 02:27:16.560 align:start position:0%
now to see what's coming down the pike
 
02:27:18.790 --> 02:27:18.800 align:start position:0%
and again this the same requirement is
 
02:27:21.110 --> 02:27:21.120 align:start position:0%
is sitting on top of all of our federal
 
02:27:23.030 --> 02:27:23.040 align:start position:0%
contractors anybody who receives
 
02:27:25.910 --> 02:27:25.920 align:start position:0%
medicare medicaid money um are also
 
02:27:28.070 --> 02:27:28.080 align:start position:0%
subject to the executive order which is
 
02:27:30.630 --> 02:27:30.640 align:start position:0%
on top of the osha order so uh good
 
02:27:31.990 --> 02:27:32.000 align:start position:0%
conversation points
 
02:27:33.349 --> 02:27:33.359 align:start position:0%
anything else senator bradley anything
 
02:27:34.389 --> 02:27:34.399 align:start position:0%
from you
 
02:27:34.399 --> 02:27:38.150 align:start position:0%
from you
well

02:27:38.150 --> 02:27:38.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:40.389 --> 02:27:40.399 align:start position:0%
i guess this is more a
 
02:27:42.790 --> 02:27:42.800 align:start position:0%
procedural question
 
02:27:46.469 --> 02:27:46.479 align:start position:0%
we're having a public hearing on monday
 
02:27:46.479 --> 02:27:47.830 align:start position:0%
we're having a public hearing on monday
right

02:27:47.830 --> 02:27:47.840 align:start position:0%
right
 
02:27:47.840 --> 02:27:51.270 align:start position:0%
right
and

02:27:51.270 --> 02:27:51.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:52.230 --> 02:27:52.240 align:start position:0%
i think
 
02:27:53.990 --> 02:27:54.000 align:start position:0%
we're meeting on wednesday as a
 
02:27:55.670 --> 02:27:55.680 align:start position:0%
committee after that
 
02:27:56.950 --> 02:27:56.960 align:start position:0%
wednesday actually we've opened it up
 
02:27:58.710 --> 02:27:58.720 align:start position:0%
for another public hearing but if we
 
02:28:00.150 --> 02:28:00.160 align:start position:0%
don't need it then we'll go do so
 
02:28:01.990 --> 02:28:02.000 align:start position:0%
committee work session
 
02:28:04.070 --> 02:28:04.080 align:start position:0%
it depends on what happens on monday
 
02:28:06.950 --> 02:28:06.960 align:start position:0%
so i mean what is
 
02:28:09.750 --> 02:28:09.760 align:start position:0%
you know with 32 bills dealing with
 
02:28:09.760 --> 02:28:14.790 align:start position:0%
you know with 32 bills dealing with
vaccines

02:28:14.790 --> 02:28:14.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:18.630 --> 02:28:18.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:21.270 --> 02:28:21.280 align:start position:0%
discuss the purpose of
 
02:28:23.030 --> 02:28:23.040 align:start position:0%
you know this committee i'm wondering
 
02:28:23.040 --> 02:28:24.790 align:start position:0%
you know this committee i'm wondering
what

02:28:24.790 --> 02:28:24.800 align:start position:0%
what
 
02:28:27.270 --> 02:28:27.280 align:start position:0%
the ultimate goal here
 
02:28:27.280 --> 02:28:28.389 align:start position:0%
the ultimate goal here
um

02:28:28.389 --> 02:28:28.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:28:31.510 --> 02:28:31.520 align:start position:0%
if the purpose of the
 
02:28:31.520 --> 02:28:31.910 align:start position:0%
if the purpose of the
um

02:28:31.910 --> 02:28:31.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:28:31.920 --> 02:28:33.110 align:start position:0%
um
[Music]

02:28:33.110 --> 02:28:33.120 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:28:35.270 --> 02:28:35.280 align:start position:0%
study was to look at medical
 
02:28:38.830 --> 02:28:38.840 align:start position:0%
intervention broader than
 
02:28:41.750 --> 02:28:41.760 align:start position:0%
vaccines and i think that was something
 
02:28:43.990 --> 02:28:44.000 align:start position:0%
you would articulate it
 
02:28:44.000 --> 02:28:46.070 align:start position:0%
you would articulate it
um

02:28:46.070 --> 02:28:46.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:28:46.080 --> 02:28:46.870 align:start position:0%
um
i

02:28:46.870 --> 02:28:46.880 align:start position:0%
i
 
02:28:48.950 --> 02:28:48.960 align:start position:0%
i understand where
 
02:28:51.190 --> 02:28:51.200 align:start position:0%
there might be a desire for
 
02:28:54.389 --> 02:28:54.399 align:start position:0%
an lsr to be submitted
 
02:28:56.070 --> 02:28:56.080 align:start position:0%
virtually all of the discussion that
 
02:28:57.830 --> 02:28:57.840 align:start position:0%
we've had and i apologize for having to
 
02:28:59.590 --> 02:28:59.600 align:start position:0%
leave early yesterday and gotten here a
 
02:29:01.270 --> 02:29:01.280 align:start position:0%
little late today
 
02:29:01.280 --> 02:29:03.270 align:start position:0%
little late today
um

02:29:03.270 --> 02:29:03.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:29:05.030 --> 02:29:05.040 align:start position:0%
all the discussion i've heard has all
 
02:29:07.429 --> 02:29:07.439 align:start position:0%
been vaccine policy i'm just
 
02:29:09.510 --> 02:29:09.520 align:start position:0%
posing the question
 
02:29:11.750 --> 02:29:11.760 align:start position:0%
with 32 bills
 
02:29:13.349 --> 02:29:13.359 align:start position:0%
does this committee need to make a
 
02:29:17.349 --> 02:29:17.359 align:start position:0%
recommendation that would develop a
 
02:29:20.469 --> 02:29:20.479 align:start position:0%
33rd lsr
 
02:29:22.469 --> 02:29:22.479 align:start position:0%
so thank you another for your question
 
02:29:24.870 --> 02:29:24.880 align:start position:0%
so again not not prejudging where we're
 
02:29:25.990 --> 02:29:26.000 align:start position:0%
going to get to
 
02:29:26.000 --> 02:29:27.190 align:start position:0%
going to get to
um

02:29:27.190 --> 02:29:27.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:29:28.710 --> 02:29:28.720 align:start position:0%
you know i did ask and i had a
 
02:29:30.469 --> 02:29:30.479 align:start position:0%
conversation with dhhs they're going to
 
02:29:31.910 --> 02:29:31.920 align:start position:0%
go back
 
02:29:33.429 --> 02:29:33.439 align:start position:0%
they didn't they're going to expand
 
02:29:34.550 --> 02:29:34.560 align:start position:0%
their search
 
02:29:36.309 --> 02:29:36.319 align:start position:0%
um because again i had the conversation
 
02:29:38.550 --> 02:29:38.560 align:start position:0%
about any medical intervention and rules
 
02:29:40.469 --> 02:29:40.479 align:start position:0%
were in law and they're going to go back
 
02:29:41.990 --> 02:29:42.000 align:start position:0%
and get us that data
 
02:29:43.830 --> 02:29:43.840 align:start position:0%
they weren't ready for to talk to us
 
02:29:45.990 --> 02:29:46.000 align:start position:0%
yesterday and they were a little bit
 
02:29:48.710 --> 02:29:48.720 align:start position:0%
more narrow in their discussion and so
 
02:29:49.910 --> 02:29:49.920 align:start position:0%
we've had that conversation with them
 
02:29:51.510 --> 02:29:51.520 align:start position:0%
they are going to come back what i'm i'm
 
02:29:51.520 --> 02:29:52.870 align:start position:0%
they are going to come back what i'm i'm
anticipating

02:29:52.870 --> 02:29:52.880 align:start position:0%
anticipating
 
02:29:56.469 --> 02:29:56.479 align:start position:0%
is that again depending on how monday's
 
02:29:58.870 --> 02:29:58.880 align:start position:0%
public hearing goes if we need more room
 
02:30:00.389 --> 02:30:00.399 align:start position:0%
another day for more public comment
 
02:30:01.830 --> 02:30:01.840 align:start position:0%
because people still want to speak then
 
02:30:03.349 --> 02:30:03.359 align:start position:0%
i want to give everybody an opportunity
 
02:30:05.349 --> 02:30:05.359 align:start position:0%
to speak um
 
02:30:07.030 --> 02:30:07.040 align:start position:0%
i i will again i'm going to caution just
 
02:30:09.590 --> 02:30:09.600 align:start position:0%
like i've i said in other places we're
 
02:30:11.830 --> 02:30:11.840 align:start position:0%
sticking to policy and not people
 
02:30:13.910 --> 02:30:13.920 align:start position:0%
right so this is not about how someone
 
02:30:15.670 --> 02:30:15.680 align:start position:0%
handled somebody so we're not going
 
02:30:17.670 --> 02:30:17.680 align:start position:0%
after people but we're going over the
 
02:30:20.150 --> 02:30:20.160 align:start position:0%
policy for the state and to keep it on
 
02:30:22.469 --> 02:30:22.479 align:start position:0%
policy um so on monday depending on as
 
02:30:25.990 --> 02:30:26.000 align:start position:0%
people speak about policy if it if if it
 
02:30:27.429 --> 02:30:27.439 align:start position:0%
seems like we still have a list of
 
02:30:29.110 --> 02:30:29.120 align:start position:0%
people that want to speak we're going to
 
02:30:30.389 --> 02:30:30.399 align:start position:0%
move on to wednesday and we'll have
 
02:30:32.230 --> 02:30:32.240 align:start position:0%
another public session during the day on
 
02:30:33.670 --> 02:30:33.680 align:start position:0%
on wednesday to allow more people to
 
02:30:33.680 --> 02:30:34.630 align:start position:0%
on wednesday to allow more people to
speak

02:30:34.630 --> 02:30:34.640 align:start position:0%
speak
 
02:30:37.270 --> 02:30:37.280 align:start position:0%
um and then ultimately after that
 
02:30:38.950 --> 02:30:38.960 align:start position:0%
we'll probably come back for one meeting
 
02:30:41.270 --> 02:30:41.280 align:start position:0%
to discuss with the agencies again one
 
02:30:43.349 --> 02:30:43.359 align:start position:0%
more time because we've asked them to go
 
02:30:44.550 --> 02:30:44.560 align:start position:0%
back and look at their rules and
 
02:30:45.750 --> 02:30:45.760 align:start position:0%
regulations and look for that
 
02:30:47.429 --> 02:30:47.439 align:start position:0%
intersections of shells and shall not
 
02:30:49.590 --> 02:30:49.600 align:start position:0%
set existing current state law
 
02:30:51.349 --> 02:30:51.359 align:start position:0%
and then we'll meet and i think we'll
 
02:30:53.670 --> 02:30:53.680 align:start position:0%
hammer out what we want to do whether or
 
02:30:56.309 --> 02:30:56.319 align:start position:0%
not it's an lsr or whether or not it's
 
02:30:58.469 --> 02:30:58.479 align:start position:0%
just a general statement you know again
 
02:30:59.910 --> 02:30:59.920 align:start position:0%
we're going back to the attorney
 
02:31:01.510 --> 02:31:01.520 align:start position:0%
generals there seems to be a valid
 
02:31:03.190 --> 02:31:03.200 align:start position:0%
reason why maybe we want to encourage
 
02:31:04.630 --> 02:31:04.640 align:start position:0%
something to pass
 
02:31:06.469 --> 02:31:06.479 align:start position:0%
to give the state a position if that is
 
02:31:08.469 --> 02:31:08.479 align:start position:0%
our position about the mandate
 
02:31:08.479 --> 02:31:09.510 align:start position:0%
our position about the mandate
um

02:31:09.510 --> 02:31:09.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:31:11.590 --> 02:31:11.600 align:start position:0%
so i i think that you know it may just
 
02:31:13.349 --> 02:31:13.359 align:start position:0%
be a general statement that says that
 
02:31:14.790 --> 02:31:14.800 align:start position:0%
here's a couple lsrs that are of
 
02:31:15.990 --> 02:31:16.000 align:start position:0%
interest and
 
02:31:17.510 --> 02:31:17.520 align:start position:0%
it's according to the attorney general
 
02:31:18.870 --> 02:31:18.880 align:start position:0%
it's a good idea to pass kind of thing
 
02:31:20.950 --> 02:31:20.960 align:start position:0%
to to make our will known to the federal
 
02:31:23.429 --> 02:31:23.439 align:start position:0%
government as a state legislature and
 
02:31:24.630 --> 02:31:24.640 align:start position:0%
as a state of new hampshire if the
 
02:31:26.469 --> 02:31:26.479 align:start position:0%
governor should sign it um it'll
 
02:31:28.309 --> 02:31:28.319 align:start position:0%
strengthen their case so i guess that's
 
02:31:29.990 --> 02:31:30.000 align:start position:0%
procedurally we have two days of public
 
02:31:32.389 --> 02:31:32.399 align:start position:0%
hearing maybe one more day of admit of
 
02:31:32.399 --> 02:31:33.429 align:start position:0%
hearing maybe one more day of admit of
of

02:31:33.429 --> 02:31:33.439 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:31:35.030 --> 02:31:35.040 align:start position:0%
coming back with i asked the new
 
02:31:36.309 --> 02:31:36.319 align:start position:0%
hampshire medical society to try to
 
02:31:37.910 --> 02:31:37.920 align:start position:0%
chase down the information about
 
02:31:39.830 --> 02:31:39.840 align:start position:0%
informed consent and and the feeling of
 
02:31:41.190 --> 02:31:41.200 align:start position:0%
their will of their people we asked
 
02:31:44.630 --> 02:31:44.640 align:start position:0%
chess to come back with some data um uh
 
02:31:46.230 --> 02:31:46.240 align:start position:0%
dave i think you were going to come back
 
02:31:48.150 --> 02:31:48.160 align:start position:0%
with some information as well so we may
 
02:31:49.670 --> 02:31:49.680 align:start position:0%
come back for one more hearing now
 
02:31:51.750 --> 02:31:51.760 align:start position:0%
people give fill in the gaps that they
 
02:31:54.230 --> 02:31:54.240 align:start position:0%
that we for questions we asked and then
 
02:31:56.630 --> 02:31:56.640 align:start position:0%
i think we move on to discussion as to
 
02:31:58.950 --> 02:31:58.960 align:start position:0%
you know the committee report can be
 
02:32:00.630 --> 02:32:00.640 align:start position:0%
current state law seems to be fine and
 
02:32:02.309 --> 02:32:02.319 align:start position:0%
there's really nothing we need to do or
 
02:32:03.990 --> 02:32:04.000 align:start position:0%
maybe here's some recommendations on
 
02:32:06.710 --> 02:32:06.720 align:start position:0%
changes in legislation um i i'm not
 
02:32:08.309 --> 02:32:08.319 align:start position:0%
going to go there until i hear all of
 
02:32:09.670 --> 02:32:09.680 align:start position:0%
the testimony because i don't know
 
02:32:11.429 --> 02:32:11.439 align:start position:0%
what's going to come out but well that
 
02:32:13.030 --> 02:32:13.040 align:start position:0%
may be there's nothing for nothing to do
 
02:32:14.950 --> 02:32:14.960 align:start position:0%
at this point again there's all kinds of
 
02:32:16.870 --> 02:32:16.880 align:start position:0%
options there
 
02:32:19.670 --> 02:32:19.680 align:start position:0%
and i think we take that up in probably
 
02:32:24.630 --> 02:32:24.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:25.910 --> 02:32:25.920 align:start position:0%
anything else is there anybody else in
 
02:32:27.830 --> 02:32:27.840 align:start position:0%
the room who wants to speak
 
02:32:29.429 --> 02:32:29.439 align:start position:0%
come on up
 
02:32:31.270 --> 02:32:31.280 align:start position:0%
just state your name and
 
02:32:35.830 --> 02:32:35.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:36.950 --> 02:32:36.960 align:start position:0%
can you hear me
 
02:32:38.790 --> 02:32:38.800 align:start position:0%
thanks hi i'm abby rogers i'm the
 
02:32:40.630 --> 02:32:40.640 align:start position:0%
legislative liaison for the division of
 
02:32:42.710 --> 02:32:42.720 align:start position:0%
public health services um i just wanted
 
02:32:45.030 --> 02:32:45.040 align:start position:0%
to provide some information regarding
 
02:32:46.790 --> 02:32:46.800 align:start position:0%
senator bradley's question about whether
 
02:32:48.469 --> 02:32:48.479 align:start position:0%
the commissioner has authority to
 
02:32:50.790 --> 02:32:50.800 align:start position:0%
approve a vaccination for child
 
02:32:52.870 --> 02:32:52.880 align:start position:0%
child care or school entry that's not
 
02:32:54.630 --> 02:32:54.640 align:start position:0%
fda approved
 
02:32:56.469 --> 02:32:56.479 align:start position:0%
the the commissioner does have authority
 
02:33:00.230 --> 02:33:00.240 align:start position:0%
through rulemaking through rsa 140 141
 
02:33:02.150 --> 02:33:02.160 align:start position:0%
ca 20a
 
02:33:02.160 --> 02:33:02.950 align:start position:0%
ca 20a
to

02:33:02.950 --> 02:33:02.960 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:33:04.710 --> 02:33:04.720 align:start position:0%
adopt rules relative to immunizations
 
02:33:06.070 --> 02:33:06.080 align:start position:0%
for child care or school injury if
 
02:33:08.469 --> 02:33:08.479 align:start position:0%
necessary um the department doesn't have
 
02:33:10.550 --> 02:33:10.560 align:start position:0%
any plans to do that at this time unless
 
02:33:12.630 --> 02:33:12.640 align:start position:0%
required a law would require us to do so
 
02:33:13.670 --> 02:33:13.680 align:start position:0%
but i just want to provide that
 
02:33:16.070 --> 02:33:16.080 align:start position:0%
clarification and there's a clarifying
 
02:33:17.990 --> 02:33:18.000 align:start position:0%
question to your clarifying information
 
02:33:20.309 --> 02:33:20.319 align:start position:0%
sure but that doesn't apply to an eua
 
02:33:22.389 --> 02:33:22.399 align:start position:0%
vaccine if um if i understand that i
 
02:33:24.630 --> 02:33:24.640 align:start position:0%
think by federal law nobody can mandate
 
02:33:26.870 --> 02:33:26.880 align:start position:0%
uh an eu related you know something
 
02:33:29.270 --> 02:33:29.280 align:start position:0%
under emergency use authorization nobody
 
02:33:31.910 --> 02:33:31.920 align:start position:0%
can mandate that that it has to be
 
02:33:34.150 --> 02:33:34.160 align:start position:0%
fully a fully vetted vaccine from the
 
02:33:36.230 --> 02:33:36.240 align:start position:0%
fda before a mandate could be implied
 
02:33:37.190 --> 02:33:37.200 align:start position:0%
right there's nothing in the new
 
02:33:38.550 --> 02:33:38.560 align:start position:0%
hampshire statute that has any
 
02:33:40.309 --> 02:33:40.319 align:start position:0%
indication about sort of an fda approval
 
02:33:40.319 --> 02:33:42.870 align:start position:0%
indication about sort of an fda approval
however

02:33:42.870 --> 02:33:42.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:44.790 --> 02:33:44.800 align:start position:0%
specifically i think there's an lsr this
 
02:33:46.469 --> 02:33:46.479 align:start position:0%
in in this yeah there is an lsr that
 
02:33:47.590 --> 02:33:47.600 align:start position:0%
talks about that yeah i just wanted to
 
02:33:49.030 --> 02:33:49.040 align:start position:0%
provide that clarification that we do
 
02:33:51.030 --> 02:33:51.040 align:start position:0%
have rulemaking authority yes thank you
 
02:33:52.070 --> 02:33:52.080 align:start position:0%
you're welcome
 
02:33:54.389 --> 02:33:54.399 align:start position:0%
senator i'm not sure i heard everything
 
02:33:56.309 --> 02:33:56.319 align:start position:0%
so i want to make sure i
 
02:33:57.510 --> 02:33:57.520 align:start position:0%
understand it
 
02:33:57.520 --> 02:33:58.790 align:start position:0%
understand it
um

02:33:58.790 --> 02:33:58.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:34:01.110 --> 02:34:01.120 align:start position:0%
in order for there to be a new
 
02:34:01.120 --> 02:34:02.710 align:start position:0%
in order for there to be a new
hampshire-based

02:34:02.710 --> 02:34:02.720 align:start position:0%
hampshire-based
 
02:34:06.389 --> 02:34:06.399 align:start position:0%
mandate for attending school or daycare
 
02:34:09.429 --> 02:34:09.439 align:start position:0%
the commissioner would have to
 
02:34:12.070 --> 02:34:12.080 align:start position:0%
initiate a rulemaking proceeding that's
 
02:34:12.080 --> 02:34:13.110 align:start position:0%
initiate a rulemaking proceeding that's
correct

02:34:13.110 --> 02:34:13.120 align:start position:0%
correct
 
02:34:15.190 --> 02:34:15.200 align:start position:0%
now would the commissioner have the
 
02:34:17.270 --> 02:34:17.280 align:start position:0%
authority under the emergency rule
 
02:34:19.510 --> 02:34:19.520 align:start position:0%
making proceeding to go through without
 
02:34:20.550 --> 02:34:20.560 align:start position:0%
it being
 
02:34:21.990 --> 02:34:22.000 align:start position:0%
fully approved
 
02:34:23.670 --> 02:34:23.680 align:start position:0%
by gel car
 
02:34:25.030 --> 02:34:25.040 align:start position:0%
it would have to be approved by jail car
 
02:34:27.349 --> 02:34:27.359 align:start position:0%
yes it would have to be approved by gel
 
02:34:32.150 --> 02:34:32.160 align:start position:0%
car because the emergency rule allows
 
02:34:34.550 --> 02:34:34.560 align:start position:0%
i believe i've never sat on gel car but
 
02:34:36.870 --> 02:34:36.880 align:start position:0%
i believe it's a six month
 
02:34:40.070 --> 02:34:40.080 align:start position:0%
emergency temporary rule
 
02:34:42.550 --> 02:34:42.560 align:start position:0%
um to go forward without full gel car
 
02:34:42.560 --> 02:34:43.670 align:start position:0%
um to go forward without full gel car
approval

02:34:43.670 --> 02:34:43.680 align:start position:0%
approval
 
02:34:46.070 --> 02:34:46.080 align:start position:0%
correct right so i think that um if
 
02:34:47.510 --> 02:34:47.520 align:start position:0%
there was an emergency rule that would
 
02:34:49.670 --> 02:34:49.680 align:start position:0%
have a different qualification but my
 
02:34:51.510 --> 02:34:51.520 align:start position:0%
understanding is that she does the
 
02:34:52.630 --> 02:34:52.640 align:start position:0%
commissioner does have rule making
 
02:34:54.230 --> 02:34:54.240 align:start position:0%
authority if it was an emergency role
 
02:34:55.510 --> 02:34:55.520 align:start position:0%
would go through that standard procedure
 
02:34:57.590 --> 02:34:57.600 align:start position:0%
of the emergency rulemaking
 
02:35:01.510 --> 02:35:01.520 align:start position:0%
for child care and school entry right so
 
02:35:03.270 --> 02:35:03.280 align:start position:0%
the commissioner could
 
02:35:03.280 --> 02:35:04.469 align:start position:0%
the commissioner could
order

02:35:04.469 --> 02:35:04.479 align:start position:0%
order
 
02:35:08.150 --> 02:35:08.160 align:start position:0%
mandatory vaccines if it was
 
02:35:11.590 --> 02:35:11.600 align:start position:0%
not under eua authority
 
02:35:13.830 --> 02:35:13.840 align:start position:0%
under an emergency rule
 
02:35:15.429 --> 02:35:15.439 align:start position:0%
okay that's how i understand it yes does
 
02:35:17.030 --> 02:35:17.040 align:start position:0%
the commissioner
 
02:35:21.750 --> 02:35:21.760 align:start position:0%
have the authority now to order vaccines
 
02:35:21.760 --> 02:35:23.190 align:start position:0%
have the authority now to order vaccines
or

02:35:23.190 --> 02:35:23.200 align:start position:0%
or
 
02:35:27.429 --> 02:35:27.439 align:start position:0%
i think is it the age of 18 or 16.
 
02:35:29.750 --> 02:35:29.760 align:start position:0%
uh i believe with consent i mean for any
 
02:35:31.510 --> 02:35:31.520 align:start position:0%
school requirement there needs to be
 
02:35:33.990 --> 02:35:34.000 align:start position:0%
vaccines um you know to enter to enter
 
02:35:35.750 --> 02:35:35.760 align:start position:0%
school so that would start at the age of
 
02:35:35.760 --> 02:35:36.550 align:start position:0%
school so that would start at the age of
three

02:35:36.550 --> 02:35:36.560 align:start position:0%
three
 
02:35:38.230 --> 02:35:38.240 align:start position:0%
um with consent from parents of course
 
02:35:39.670 --> 02:35:39.680 align:start position:0%
but there she could separate i mean they
 
02:35:41.910 --> 02:35:41.920 align:start position:0%
could said uh the commissioner could
 
02:35:43.990 --> 02:35:44.000 align:start position:0%
adopt rules requiring additional
 
02:35:46.790 --> 02:35:46.800 align:start position:0%
vaccines for school or child care entry
 
02:35:48.870 --> 02:35:48.880 align:start position:0%
at any time through rulemaking
 
02:35:51.349 --> 02:35:51.359 align:start position:0%
but with a rulemaking proceeding correct
 
02:35:55.190 --> 02:35:55.200 align:start position:0%
you're 141 um c20 c20-a but we don't
 
02:35:57.910 --> 02:35:57.920 align:start position:0%
tend to do that unless required by by
 
02:36:00.150 --> 02:36:00.160 align:start position:0%
statute at this point
 
02:36:01.990 --> 02:36:02.000 align:start position:0%
wait a minute i didn't get that last
 
02:36:04.710 --> 02:36:04.720 align:start position:0%
part oh sorry we're not intending to um
 
02:36:06.550 --> 02:36:06.560 align:start position:0%
mandate a coveted vaccine in schools
 
02:36:08.710 --> 02:36:08.720 align:start position:0%
unless there was a law suggesting that
 
02:36:11.110 --> 02:36:11.120 align:start position:0%
we do that all right so the so the the
 
02:36:12.950 --> 02:36:12.960 align:start position:0%
bottom line here if i'm understanding
 
02:36:14.950 --> 02:36:14.960 align:start position:0%
you correctly what you just said there
 
02:36:16.550 --> 02:36:16.560 align:start position:0%
is no
 
02:36:18.389 --> 02:36:18.399 align:start position:0%
thought at this point in time by the
 
02:36:20.550 --> 02:36:20.560 align:start position:0%
department of health and human services
 
02:36:23.830 --> 02:36:23.840 align:start position:0%
absent a new law being passed to mandate
 
02:36:26.790 --> 02:36:26.800 align:start position:0%
for school-aged children any vaccine the
 
02:36:29.590 --> 02:36:29.600 align:start position:0%
covenant 19 vaccines 19 yes i'm sorry
 
02:36:31.110 --> 02:36:31.120 align:start position:0%
yes that's correct that's correct that's
 
02:36:33.190 --> 02:36:33.200 align:start position:0%
correct okay i just wanted to clarify
 
02:36:33.200 --> 02:36:34.630 align:start position:0%
correct okay i just wanted to clarify
that

02:36:34.630 --> 02:36:34.640 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:36:36.469 --> 02:36:36.479 align:start position:0%
senator that would be a while to get to
 
02:36:39.429 --> 02:36:39.439 align:start position:0%
the clarification but i think
 
02:36:42.150 --> 02:36:42.160 align:start position:0%
i understand it and i suspect that
 
02:36:43.910 --> 02:36:43.920 align:start position:0%
you know for people that are watching us
 
02:36:46.950 --> 02:36:46.960 align:start position:0%
online i appreciate your uh
 
02:36:49.590 --> 02:36:49.600 align:start position:0%
your answer of course thank you
 
02:36:51.270 --> 02:36:51.280 align:start position:0%

02:36:52.710 --> 02:36:52.720 align:start position:0%
speaker and been on jail car for the
 
02:36:56.150 --> 02:36:56.160 align:start position:0%
last three terms um i will say that uh
 
02:36:58.150 --> 02:36:58.160 align:start position:0%
the emergency orders do come before
 
02:37:00.389 --> 02:37:00.399 align:start position:0%
jalcar we just have no there's no vote
 
02:37:02.550 --> 02:37:02.560 align:start position:0%
taken we don't vote on them they're just
 
02:37:05.190 --> 02:37:05.200 align:start position:0%
prince presented to jalcar and we can
 
02:37:07.670 --> 02:37:07.680 align:start position:0%
ask questions about it um but we can't
 
02:37:09.190 --> 02:37:09.200 align:start position:0%
do anything about it if they if they
 
02:37:10.630 --> 02:37:10.640 align:start position:0%
would implement but i'm glad to hear
 
02:37:14.150 --> 02:37:14.160 align:start position:0%
that dhhs the commission has no in uh
 
02:37:17.030 --> 02:37:17.040 align:start position:0%
inclination to right now put a covet 19
 
02:37:20.550 --> 02:37:20.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:21.670 --> 02:37:21.680 align:start position:0%
