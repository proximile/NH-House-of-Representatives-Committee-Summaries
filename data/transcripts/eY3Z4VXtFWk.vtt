minutes good morning Mr chair and
 
00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:41.680 align:start position:0%
members of the commission uh for the
 
00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:44.400 align:start position:0%

00:03:48.789 --> 00:03:48.799 align:start position:0%
Deputy Treasurer Rachel Miller just
 
00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:51.840 align:start position:0%
joining me um so uh thank you very much
 
00:03:54.309 --> 00:03:54.319 align:start position:0%
for for inviting us to to come over
 
00:03:57.869 --> 00:03:57.879 align:start position:0%
today um I do have a few points that I
 
00:04:00.589 --> 00:04:00.599 align:start position:0%
think I would like to cut cover first
 
00:04:04.789 --> 00:04:04.799 align:start position:0%
but then um sounds more than anything um
 
00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:06.680 align:start position:0%
I'll be happy to answer any questions
 
00:04:10.429 --> 00:04:10.439 align:start position:0%
the commission may have for for
 
00:04:13.429 --> 00:04:13.439 align:start position:0%
us and I know there's some hands outs um
 
00:04:13.439 --> 00:04:15.349 align:start position:0%
us and I know there's some hands outs um
being

00:04:15.349 --> 00:04:15.359 align:start position:0%
being
 
00:04:15.359 --> 00:04:28.590 align:start position:0%
being
um

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:28.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:30.550 align:start position:0%
 
distributed

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:30.560 align:start position:0%
distributed
 
00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:32.560 align:start position:0%
so it's the one pager that Miss Mell is
 
00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:51.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:53.120 align:start position:0%
referencing well thank you very much it
 
00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:56.880 align:start position:0%
sounds like everyone has the hand out um
 
00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:00.000 align:start position:0%
so there's probably really not a lot new
 
00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:03.560 align:start position:0%
uh in this page but um essentially from
 
00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:06.360 align:start position:0%
um my understanding of what the model uh
 
00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:11.880 align:start position:0%
there isbi um um right now is being um
 
00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:14.120 align:start position:0%
explored uh by this commission is to
 
00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:17.160 align:start position:0%
establish uh a franchise model where the
 
00:05:19.029 --> 00:05:19.039 align:start position:0%
uh uh Liquor Commission is going to
 
00:05:21.469 --> 00:05:21.479 align:start position:0%
oversee uh the franchises uh the
 
00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:24.160 align:start position:0%
franchises and and and The Business of
 
00:05:26.909 --> 00:05:26.919 align:start position:0%
legalizing cannabis in the state so um
 
00:05:28.309 --> 00:05:28.319 align:start position:0%
some of the points that I'm just
 
00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:30.720 align:start position:0%
including here is really had to do have
 
00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:33.680 align:start position:0%
to do with banking um but perhaps
 
00:05:35.909 --> 00:05:35.919 align:start position:0%
because uh the banking Association is is
 
00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:38.000 align:start position:0%
is here as you probably all very
 
00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:40.280 align:start position:0%
familiar with some of the concerns um
 
00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:43.080 align:start position:0%
that exist around um banking but um so
 
00:05:45.629 --> 00:05:45.639 align:start position:0%
my first point um the first ball is
 
00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:48.600 align:start position:0%
really um the banking may represent um a
 
00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:51.080 align:start position:0%
challenge for for the potential retail
 
00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:54.280 align:start position:0%
owners um uh my understanding is there
 
00:05:57.390 --> 00:05:57.400 align:start position:0%
are some um out ofate uh chhada Banks
 
00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:00.080 align:start position:0%
and perhaps in State chhat Bank banks
 
00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:02.240 align:start position:0%
that are will be willing to to do
 
00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:04.280 align:start position:0%
business uh with some of the retail
 
00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:06.840 align:start position:0%
owners um but again uh there will be
 
00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:09.120 align:start position:0%
those challenges and and until
 
00:06:10.749 --> 00:06:10.759 align:start position:0%
legislation is passed at the federal
 
00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:13.160 align:start position:0%
level really those those challenges are
 
00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:16.880 align:start position:0%
not going to go away um nothing really
 
00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:19.160 align:start position:0%
has changed over the years in in that
 
00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:22.280 align:start position:0%
you know in that um related to that
 
00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:24.720 align:start position:0%
aspect so so again that represents a
 
00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:27.680 align:start position:0%
rest for for um again the banking
 
00:06:29.749 --> 00:06:29.759 align:start position:0%
represents a rest for for some thanks
 
00:06:30.909 --> 00:06:30.919 align:start position:0%
and again
 
00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:35.080 align:start position:0%
for uh for the potential owners of uh of
 
00:06:38.309 --> 00:06:38.319 align:start position:0%
cannabis business so so uh for example
 
00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:39.840 align:start position:0%
my understanding is the existing
 
00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:42.240 align:start position:0%
facilities selling cannabis for medical
 
00:06:44.589 --> 00:06:44.599 align:start position:0%
purposes um I don't know this for a fact
 
00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:46.680 align:start position:0%
but I believe they're doing banking with
 
00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:49.440 align:start position:0%
uh banks in Massachusetts so um again
 
00:06:51.029 --> 00:06:51.039 align:start position:0%
that may be different right now but
 
00:06:55.270 --> 00:06:55.280 align:start position:0%
minus that's how they begin um their
 
00:06:57.390 --> 00:06:57.400 align:start position:0%
establishments so the second point is
 
00:06:59.550 --> 00:06:59.560 align:start position:0%
really that the state may face some some
 
00:07:02.790 --> 00:07:02.800 align:start position:0%
similar challenges we we are aware that
 
00:07:05.189 --> 00:07:05.199 align:start position:0%
um we are fully aware that there are
 
00:07:06.950 --> 00:07:06.960 align:start position:0%
some banks that don't want to be
 
00:07:09.589 --> 00:07:09.599 align:start position:0%
associated with with the Cannabis uh
 
00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:11.160 align:start position:0%
again due to the regulations at the
 
00:07:14.629 --> 00:07:14.639 align:start position:0%
feral level um so we know there are
 
00:07:17.589 --> 00:07:17.599 align:start position:0%
some we know of banks that have again
 
00:07:19.469 --> 00:07:19.479 align:start position:0%
different different positions so may be
 
00:07:22.909 --> 00:07:22.919 align:start position:0%
willing to um want to continue doing
 
00:07:24.909 --> 00:07:24.919 align:start position:0%
business with the state and and and
 
00:07:27.670 --> 00:07:27.680 align:start position:0%
treat our Revenue the same way uh but
 
00:07:29.749 --> 00:07:29.759 align:start position:0%
there are some banks that clear CLE have
 
00:07:31.189 --> 00:07:31.199 align:start position:0%
said no we we don't want to be
 
00:07:33.230 --> 00:07:33.240 align:start position:0%
associated with that so some of our
 
00:07:35.830 --> 00:07:35.840 align:start position:0%
challenges are going to be um so the
 
00:07:36.990 --> 00:07:37.000 align:start position:0%
third Point again I'm just sort of
 
00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:39.840 align:start position:0%
rolling now um the third point is we do
 
00:07:42.309 --> 00:07:42.319 align:start position:0%
have uh many relationships Bank banking
 
00:07:45.710 --> 00:07:45.720 align:start position:0%
relationships with many banks um but we
 
00:07:47.309 --> 00:07:47.319 align:start position:0%
conduct most of our business with the
 
00:07:49.909 --> 00:07:49.919 align:start position:0%
three major um federally chared Banks
 
00:07:52.629 --> 00:07:52.639 align:start position:0%
and the state um we do that because of
 
00:07:54.950 --> 00:07:54.960 align:start position:0%
the large footprint in in their
 
00:07:56.990 --> 00:07:57.000 align:start position:0%
infrastructure they have accommodate the
 
00:07:58.670 --> 00:07:58.680 align:start position:0%
the state's business what the state
 
00:08:03.469 --> 00:08:03.479 align:start position:0%
needs to conduct this business um so so
 
00:08:05.469 --> 00:08:05.479 align:start position:0%
with with those relationships we have to
 
00:08:08.990 --> 00:08:09.000 align:start position:0%
really uh consider and and have clear
 
00:08:11.270 --> 00:08:11.280 align:start position:0%
discussions um about whether they're
 
00:08:15.430 --> 00:08:15.440 align:start position:0%
willing to continue um uh you know just
 
00:08:17.430 --> 00:08:17.440 align:start position:0%
considering um the collections the
 
00:08:19.510 --> 00:08:19.520 align:start position:0%
revenue collections if they're okay
 
00:08:21.990 --> 00:08:22.000 align:start position:0%
considering those just like any
 
00:08:24.309 --> 00:08:24.319 align:start position:0%
collections or or they don't want to
 
00:08:25.869 --> 00:08:25.879 align:start position:0%
have anything to do with that because
 
00:08:28.629 --> 00:08:28.639 align:start position:0%
they know there is cannabis um revenue
 
00:08:29.869 --> 00:08:29.879 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:08:32.350 --> 00:08:32.360 align:start position:0%
commingle with that so again we've seen
 
00:08:35.230 --> 00:08:35.240 align:start position:0%
we've heard two positions um and so it
 
00:08:36.469 --> 00:08:36.479 align:start position:0%
would be a matter of reviewing our
 
00:08:37.949 --> 00:08:37.959 align:start position:0%
agreements with them having conversation
 
00:08:40.589 --> 00:08:40.599 align:start position:0%
with them at them and perhaps re
 
00:08:42.350 --> 00:08:42.360 align:start position:0%
receiving some guidance from the um
 
00:08:43.909 --> 00:08:43.919 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office as to how we
 
00:08:46.110 --> 00:08:46.120 align:start position:0%
should proceed in those cases if the
 
00:08:48.110 --> 00:08:48.120 align:start position:0%
legislation were to
 
00:08:51.710 --> 00:08:51.720 align:start position:0%
pass um so that's um related to U again
 
00:08:54.470 --> 00:08:54.480 align:start position:0%
our our potential challenges that we we
 
00:08:59.269 --> 00:08:59.279 align:start position:0%
may see um um U again if this leg leg
 
00:09:02.829 --> 00:09:02.839 align:start position:0%
istion were to pass um and I sort of um
 
00:09:06.030 --> 00:09:06.040 align:start position:0%
just went down to to the last Point um
 
00:09:09.910 --> 00:09:09.920 align:start position:0%
you know from a cash um FL perspective
 
00:09:11.509 --> 00:09:11.519 align:start position:0%
and again this is based on a little bit
 
00:09:13.750 --> 00:09:13.760 align:start position:0%
of what we have learned we've learned uh
 
00:09:16.949 --> 00:09:16.959 align:start position:0%
how the commission is planning to to uh
 
00:09:19.470 --> 00:09:19.480 align:start position:0%
do the collections of of you know the
 
00:09:23.430 --> 00:09:23.440 align:start position:0%
franchise fee um we which just want to
 
00:09:25.710 --> 00:09:25.720 align:start position:0%
mention that you know at the treasury we
 
00:09:28.829 --> 00:09:28.839 align:start position:0%
care about our cash flows so um if this
 
00:09:31.750 --> 00:09:31.760 align:start position:0%
um businesses are going to be charged um
 
00:09:36.150 --> 00:09:36.160 align:start position:0%
um a franchise fee based on gr sales um
 
00:09:38.350 --> 00:09:38.360 align:start position:0%
and those are monthly sales the state
 
00:09:39.790 --> 00:09:39.800 align:start position:0%
could benefit for that monthly
 
00:09:43.870 --> 00:09:43.880 align:start position:0%
collection of Revenue um it's that's
 
00:09:46.350 --> 00:09:46.360 align:start position:0%
what most states do they tax and they
 
00:09:47.910 --> 00:09:47.920 align:start position:0%
collect those revenues on a monthly
 
00:09:50.870 --> 00:09:50.880 align:start position:0%
basis so having that uh Revenue stream
 
00:09:52.269 --> 00:09:52.279 align:start position:0%
uh predictable Revenue stream for the
 
00:09:54.910 --> 00:09:54.920 align:start position:0%
state will be beneficial for again to to
 
00:09:54.920 --> 00:09:56.190 align:start position:0%
state will be beneficial for again to to
maintain

00:09:56.190 --> 00:09:56.200 align:start position:0%
maintain
 
00:09:59.550 --> 00:09:59.560 align:start position:0%
um um just comfortable cash level
 
00:10:01.910 --> 00:10:01.920 align:start position:0%
especially now in the amount of the the
 
00:10:04.470 --> 00:10:04.480 align:start position:0%
the um the estimates that we're
 
00:10:06.710 --> 00:10:06.720 align:start position:0%
hearing the potentially large amount of
 
00:10:08.590 --> 00:10:08.600 align:start position:0%
Revenue will will come back to the state
 
00:10:12.389 --> 00:10:12.399 align:start position:0%
from these fees um so that's sort of
 
00:10:14.030 --> 00:10:14.040 align:start position:0%
what I wanted to cover again not really
 
00:10:15.990 --> 00:10:16.000 align:start position:0%
knowing what the commission wanted to
 
00:10:18.509 --> 00:10:18.519 align:start position:0%
really hear from us but those are the
 
00:10:21.630 --> 00:10:21.640 align:start position:0%
points that um again thinking about the
 
00:10:24.110 --> 00:10:24.120 align:start position:0%
potential challenges nothing new all the
 
00:10:27.670 --> 00:10:27.680 align:start position:0%
states have facing similar challenges um
 
00:10:29.430 --> 00:10:29.440 align:start position:0%
you know again we will probably have
 
00:10:32.350 --> 00:10:32.360 align:start position:0%
more conversations for um neighboring
 
00:10:35.670 --> 00:10:35.680 align:start position:0%
states Maine um Vermont to see how
 
00:10:38.069 --> 00:10:38.079 align:start position:0%
they're handling some of those you know
 
00:10:40.509 --> 00:10:40.519 align:start position:0%
again potential challenges um and again
 
00:10:42.790 --> 00:10:42.800 align:start position:0%
I'm perhaps receiving guidance from the
 
00:10:46.150 --> 00:10:46.160 align:start position:0%
um um the bank and Department that might
 
00:10:49.470 --> 00:10:49.480 align:start position:0%
help uh also try to make things simple
 
00:10:52.230 --> 00:10:52.240 align:start position:0%
once those um you know once all these uh
 
00:10:54.030 --> 00:10:54.040 align:start position:0%
business owners are able to establish
 
00:10:54.040 --> 00:10:55.150 align:start position:0%
business owners are able to establish
banking

00:10:55.150 --> 00:10:55.160 align:start position:0%
banking
 
00:10:57.550 --> 00:10:57.560 align:start position:0%
relationships um then the state probably
 
00:11:00.990 --> 00:11:01.000 align:start position:0%
should have again the state you have um
 
00:11:03.110 --> 00:11:03.120 align:start position:0%
you know less challenges we want to
 
00:11:07.670 --> 00:11:07.680 align:start position:0%
collect um we here as a cash business
 
00:11:09.590 --> 00:11:09.600 align:start position:0%
that's that's always risky to have you
 
00:11:12.310 --> 00:11:12.320 align:start position:0%
know large amounts of cash um so
 
00:11:14.389 --> 00:11:14.399 align:start position:0%
preferably the St will collect money you
 
00:11:17.389 --> 00:11:17.399 align:start position:0%
know electronically via check um
 
00:11:20.509 --> 00:11:20.519 align:start position:0%
hopefully we don't see cash coming to us
 
00:11:22.870 --> 00:11:22.880 align:start position:0%
as a form of Revenue
 
00:11:25.350 --> 00:11:25.360 align:start position:0%
so again this is all I have for remarks
 
00:11:27.550 --> 00:11:27.560 align:start position:0%
I'll be happy to answer any questions
 
00:11:29.590 --> 00:11:29.600 align:start position:0%
great so I I just want to start with
 
00:11:31.230 --> 00:11:31.240 align:start position:0%
just some some some of what I think I
 
00:11:33.990 --> 00:11:34.000 align:start position:0%
know and maybe you can confirm um it so
 
00:11:35.790 --> 00:11:35.800 align:start position:0%
we can understand the banking and what
 
00:11:38.069 --> 00:11:38.079 align:start position:0%
might happen around this is my
 
00:11:39.550 --> 00:11:39.560 align:start position:0%
understanding is the US Treasury
 
00:11:41.710 --> 00:11:41.720 align:start position:0%
Financial crimes enforcement Network Von
 
00:11:44.790 --> 00:11:44.800 align:start position:0%
has has issued guidance for banks to be
 
00:11:46.750 --> 00:11:46.760 align:start position:0%
able to how they deal with cannabis so
 
00:11:48.990 --> 00:11:49.000 align:start position:0%
banks are allowed to but there are some
 
00:11:50.150 --> 00:11:50.160 align:start position:0%
that may still want to stay away for
 
00:11:52.150 --> 00:11:52.160 align:start position:0%
whatever business reasons but that's my
 
00:11:53.550 --> 00:11:53.560 align:start position:0%
understanding there is there are a set
 
00:11:55.509 --> 00:11:55.519 align:start position:0%
of guidelines for banks to
 
00:11:57.949 --> 00:11:57.959 align:start position:0%
follow is it you is that
 
00:11:57.959 --> 00:11:59.990 align:start position:0%
follow is it you is that
correct

00:11:59.990 --> 00:12:00.000 align:start position:0%
correct
 
00:12:02.110 --> 00:12:02.120 align:start position:0%
all we are hearing again this there's
 
00:12:04.310 --> 00:12:04.320 align:start position:0%
more that we need to again evaluate all
 
00:12:06.990 --> 00:12:07.000 align:start position:0%
our existing relationships but um we're
 
00:12:08.790 --> 00:12:08.800 align:start position:0%
clear some some banks that we do
 
00:12:10.790 --> 00:12:10.800 align:start position:0%
business with currently they have a very
 
00:12:13.790 --> 00:12:13.800 align:start position:0%
clear position that they will not get
 
00:12:16.069 --> 00:12:16.079 align:start position:0%
involved um they don't even want to know
 
00:12:18.470 --> 00:12:18.480 align:start position:0%
about Revenue coming from the Cannabis
 
00:12:20.389 --> 00:12:20.399 align:start position:0%
industry so so that's one clear position
 
00:12:21.790 --> 00:12:21.800 align:start position:0%
and we just need to understand those
 
00:12:24.790 --> 00:12:24.800 align:start position:0%
positions um and and and figured out how
 
00:12:27.189 --> 00:12:27.199 align:start position:0%
to to cond again collect our Revenue
 
00:12:28.910 --> 00:12:28.920 align:start position:0%
based on those banks that are willing to
 
00:12:33.509 --> 00:12:33.519 align:start position:0%
to uh to accept this um so as this so so
 
00:12:34.870 --> 00:12:34.880 align:start position:0%
again if this bill was to move forward
 
00:12:37.069 --> 00:12:37.079 align:start position:0%
and common law the
 
00:12:40.269 --> 00:12:40.279 align:start position:0%
banking concerns for the state is we do
 
00:12:42.389 --> 00:12:42.399 align:start position:0%
we are already doing businesses that
 
00:12:44.110 --> 00:12:44.120 align:start position:0%
would be willing to accept these kind of
 
00:12:46.670 --> 00:12:46.680 align:start position:0%
funds um understanding the finson
 
00:12:48.590 --> 00:12:48.600 align:start position:0%
requirements and managing it that way is
 
00:12:50.670 --> 00:12:50.680 align:start position:0%
that is that true I believe so I think
 
00:12:52.269 --> 00:12:52.279 align:start position:0%
part of the reason we we never really
 
00:12:54.509 --> 00:12:54.519 align:start position:0%
had a very uh in-depth discussion with
 
00:12:58.829 --> 00:12:58.839 align:start position:0%
the banks is because for us it was um no
 
00:13:01.790 --> 00:13:01.800 align:start position:0%
no one really uh brought this up as a
 
00:13:04.550 --> 00:13:04.560 align:start position:0%
problem so for us it's been uh again the
 
00:13:06.629 --> 00:13:06.639 align:start position:0%
licensing the the license fees that
 
00:13:08.350 --> 00:13:08.360 align:start position:0%
we've been collecting those have been
 
00:13:10.949 --> 00:13:10.959 align:start position:0%
coming as regular Revenue it's really
 
00:13:13.269 --> 00:13:13.279 align:start position:0%
more now that we're asking the questions
 
00:13:16.150 --> 00:13:16.160 align:start position:0%
you know were more um you know more
 
00:13:18.030 --> 00:13:18.040 align:start position:0%
direct with banks you know do you have
 
00:13:21.590 --> 00:13:21.600 align:start position:0%
any suggestions and then we again from
 
00:13:24.230 --> 00:13:24.240 align:start position:0%
one of our existing Partners was very
 
00:13:25.790 --> 00:13:25.800 align:start position:0%
clear their position we wouldn't we
 
00:13:28.189 --> 00:13:28.199 align:start position:0%
wouldn't accept this Revenue but but
 
00:13:31.350 --> 00:13:31.360 align:start position:0%
again we do business with uh many banks
 
00:13:33.150 --> 00:13:33.160 align:start position:0%
and and and I know for sure they will
 
00:13:35.509 --> 00:13:35.519 align:start position:0%
have different positions great and the
 
00:13:37.550 --> 00:13:37.560 align:start position:0%
last question I have is or understanding
 
00:13:40.790 --> 00:13:40.800 align:start position:0%
I have is again this bill establishes a
 
00:13:43.710 --> 00:13:43.720 align:start position:0%
new fund under the state for the purpos
 
00:13:46.790 --> 00:13:46.800 align:start position:0%
of you know um treatment programs and
 
00:13:48.629 --> 00:13:48.639 align:start position:0%
and other things that's not going to be
 
00:13:50.990 --> 00:13:51.000 align:start position:0%
a problem to manages as well creating a
 
00:13:52.310 --> 00:13:52.320 align:start position:0%
fund like that within the state you
 
00:13:54.069 --> 00:13:54.079 align:start position:0%
think that's able I think the concern is
 
00:13:56.629 --> 00:13:56.639 align:start position:0%
the co-mingling of money right where and
 
00:13:58.389 --> 00:13:58.399 align:start position:0%
if if the feds ever decide to swoop in
 
00:14:00.629 --> 00:14:00.639 align:start position:0%
and do something that we have that money
 
00:14:03.150 --> 00:14:03.160 align:start position:0%
as a separate you know not comingled
 
00:14:04.829 --> 00:14:04.839 align:start position:0%
with other state money so they don't
 
00:14:06.430 --> 00:14:06.440 align:start position:0%
just confiscate the entire bank account
 
00:14:08.870 --> 00:14:08.880 align:start position:0%
so to speak yeah that's going to be very
 
00:14:11.509 --> 00:14:11.519 align:start position:0%
difficult especially so so so creating a
 
00:14:14.230 --> 00:14:14.240 align:start position:0%
fund is not a problem um that that's
 
00:14:17.230 --> 00:14:17.240 align:start position:0%
that's very simple um the accounting as
 
00:14:19.150 --> 00:14:19.160 align:start position:0%
you know once
 
00:14:21.629 --> 00:14:21.639 align:start position:0%
this it'll be interesting how we how we
 
00:14:23.670 --> 00:14:23.680 align:start position:0%
handle this but the fund yes I mean the
 
00:14:26.310 --> 00:14:26.320 align:start position:0%
accounting of that fund will be clear
 
00:14:28.150 --> 00:14:28.160 align:start position:0%
and but there's money coming and going
 
00:14:30.269 --> 00:14:30.279 align:start position:0%
to several places it'll be transfers to
 
00:14:31.870 --> 00:14:31.880 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
00:14:34.310 --> 00:14:34.320 align:start position:0%
transfers to the to education trust fund
 
00:14:38.310 --> 00:14:38.320 align:start position:0%
so um it's going to be complicated in
 
00:14:40.749 --> 00:14:40.759 align:start position:0%
terms of keeping that clean I mean there
 
00:14:42.550 --> 00:14:42.560 align:start position:0%
are things that we can do again we you
 
00:14:46.790 --> 00:14:46.800 align:start position:0%
know you know for examp um yeah great
 
00:14:48.629 --> 00:14:48.639 align:start position:0%
question I think um you know one of the
 
00:14:50.629 --> 00:14:50.639 align:start position:0%
things that we can do you know in terms
 
00:14:52.550 --> 00:14:52.560 align:start position:0%
of cash we could probably have again try
 
00:14:54.670 --> 00:14:54.680 align:start position:0%
to segregate the funds themselves and
 
00:14:56.870 --> 00:14:56.880 align:start position:0%
notom mangle them with the regular State
 
00:14:59.189 --> 00:14:59.199 align:start position:0%
business um that's something we will
 
00:15:01.389 --> 00:15:01.399 align:start position:0%
explore um the fund itself the
 
00:15:04.629 --> 00:15:04.639 align:start position:0%
accounting will have specific tracking
 
00:15:06.230 --> 00:15:06.240 align:start position:0%
of all of the transactions so I think
 
00:15:08.350 --> 00:15:08.360 align:start position:0%
there'll be a way to to Really
 
00:15:10.110 --> 00:15:10.120 align:start position:0%
differentiate if the federal government
 
00:15:13.269 --> 00:15:13.279 align:start position:0%
came after the state to to say okay this
 
00:15:16.269 --> 00:15:16.279 align:start position:0%
is this relates to the Canabis um
 
00:15:18.430 --> 00:15:18.440 align:start position:0%
business collections great questions
 
00:15:21.030 --> 00:15:21.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:23.030 --> 00:15:23.040 align:start position:0%
committee thank you Mr chair and thank
 
00:15:25.430 --> 00:15:25.440 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question it seems to
 
00:15:27.269 --> 00:15:27.279 align:start position:0%
me um when we're talking about banking
 
00:15:30.389 --> 00:15:30.399 align:start position:0%
relationships under bullet number two um
 
00:15:33.430 --> 00:15:33.440 align:start position:0%
it would be a smart decision not to uh
 
00:15:36.710 --> 00:15:36.720 align:start position:0%
engage in this um scheme it it seems to
 
00:15:40.309 --> 00:15:40.319 align:start position:0%
me um it it constitutes money laundering
 
00:15:40.319 --> 00:15:41.749 align:start position:0%
me um it it constitutes money laundering
doesn't

00:15:41.749 --> 00:15:41.759 align:start position:0%
doesn't
 
00:15:44.110 --> 00:15:44.120 align:start position:0%
it it it
 
00:15:47.230 --> 00:15:47.240 align:start position:0%
does um it we would just be operating
 
00:15:50.990 --> 00:15:51.000 align:start position:0%
under state law um again I think um at
 
00:15:53.749 --> 00:15:53.759 align:start position:0%
the feral level there are discussions
 
00:15:56.509 --> 00:15:56.519 align:start position:0%
about uh for example The Proposal of the
 
00:15:59.670 --> 00:15:59.680 align:start position:0%
um uh the safe banking act that sounds
 
00:16:03.350 --> 00:16:03.360 align:start position:0%
like his um has by pison support um it's
 
00:16:05.790 --> 00:16:05.800 align:start position:0%
just you know once and every state is
 
00:16:07.150 --> 00:16:07.160 align:start position:0%
dealing with that there are so many
 
00:16:09.430 --> 00:16:09.440 align:start position:0%
states doing business so I think it's
 
00:16:12.790 --> 00:16:12.800 align:start position:0%
just a matter of time
 
00:16:15.350 --> 00:16:15.360 align:start position:0%
um but but you're absolutely correct
 
00:16:19.269 --> 00:16:19.279 align:start position:0%
it's it's just not legal at the federal
 
00:16:23.350 --> 00:16:23.360 align:start position:0%
level um you mentioned uh the banks that
 
00:16:25.430 --> 00:16:25.440 align:start position:0%
the state is currently dealing with many
 
00:16:29.189 --> 00:16:29.199 align:start position:0%
are uh you know refusing
 
00:16:32.230 --> 00:16:32.240 align:start position:0%
uh to do business with an illegal
 
00:16:36.110 --> 00:16:36.120 align:start position:0%
operation uh so how um has have any
 
00:16:39.309 --> 00:16:39.319 align:start position:0%
stepped forward that said yes I'm all
 
00:16:42.470 --> 00:16:42.480 align:start position:0%
in we are aware of one one bank at least
 
00:16:44.870 --> 00:16:44.880 align:start position:0%
again we haven't had open conversations
 
00:16:47.269 --> 00:16:47.279 align:start position:0%
with with the banks again just because
 
00:16:49.110 --> 00:16:49.120 align:start position:0%
um I was trying to prepare for for you
 
00:16:52.189 --> 00:16:52.199 align:start position:0%
know for this meeting um but but
 
00:16:54.110 --> 00:16:54.120 align:start position:0%
certainly we'll have we have to have
 
00:16:55.430 --> 00:16:55.440 align:start position:0%
those conversations with all the banks
 
00:16:57.509 --> 00:16:57.519 align:start position:0%
and review our agreements there's one
 
00:16:58.990 --> 00:16:59.000 align:start position:0%
particular band we had to opportunity to
 
00:17:03.230 --> 00:17:03.240 align:start position:0%
speak with uh recently and their view is
 
00:17:06.230 --> 00:17:06.240 align:start position:0%
that the there's
 
00:17:08.829 --> 00:17:08.839 align:start position:0%
a the business that the state will
 
00:17:11.829 --> 00:17:11.839 align:start position:0%
conduct is is not directly related to
 
00:17:14.309 --> 00:17:14.319 align:start position:0%
the Cannabis meaning there is not the
 
00:17:17.789 --> 00:17:17.799 align:start position:0%
liquid stores selling the product is
 
00:17:21.189 --> 00:17:21.199 align:start position:0%
really um the stores selling it and then
 
00:17:23.870 --> 00:17:23.880 align:start position:0%
they're just remitting that um the fees
 
00:17:25.789 --> 00:17:25.799 align:start position:0%
the taxes however this is going to be
 
00:17:28.029 --> 00:17:28.039 align:start position:0%
called um so that's they see it as a
 
00:17:31.310 --> 00:17:31.320 align:start position:0%
separate it um meaning having an
 
00:17:33.630 --> 00:17:33.640 align:start position:0%
indirect relationship or receiving that
 
00:17:37.029 --> 00:17:37.039 align:start position:0%
indirectly allows them to collect uh
 
00:17:39.390 --> 00:17:39.400 align:start position:0%
those revenues in and transact with us
 
00:17:43.070 --> 00:17:43.080 align:start position:0%
that's this particular bank's view uh
 
00:17:45.350 --> 00:17:45.360 align:start position:0%
again not all have the same view one
 
00:17:48.270 --> 00:17:48.280 align:start position:0%
followup please one more that that being
 
00:17:52.549 --> 00:17:52.559 align:start position:0%
the case um would that limit liability
 
00:17:55.870 --> 00:17:55.880 align:start position:0%
to the state with that 15% Revenue uh it
 
00:17:57.470 --> 00:17:57.480 align:start position:0%
seems to me that that's still under
 
00:17:59.590 --> 00:17:59.600 align:start position:0%
finsen would be
 
00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:02.710 align:start position:0%
finsen would be
um

00:18:02.710 --> 00:18:02.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:05.390 --> 00:18:05.400 align:start position:0%
illegal I I'm not um probably not the
 
00:18:07.310 --> 00:18:07.320 align:start position:0%
right person to speak about liability I
 
00:18:09.310 --> 00:18:09.320 align:start position:0%
think uh probably you know all of those
 
00:18:12.190 --> 00:18:12.200 align:start position:0%
discussions will have to be um held with
 
00:18:14.029 --> 00:18:14.039 align:start position:0%
Department of Justice and we will have
 
00:18:16.990 --> 00:18:17.000 align:start position:0%
those discussions again once because we
 
00:18:19.270 --> 00:18:19.280 align:start position:0%
will have to review our existing um
 
00:18:21.270 --> 00:18:21.280 align:start position:0%
existing agreements as far as we know
 
00:18:24.789 --> 00:18:24.799 align:start position:0%
there are some Clauses that speak about
 
00:18:27.590 --> 00:18:27.600 align:start position:0%
um um is it that we don't do any illegal
 
00:18:30.710 --> 00:18:30.720 align:start position:0%
business this section internet gambling
 
00:18:33.669 --> 00:18:33.679 align:start position:0%
like internet gambling and then we we
 
00:18:36.070 --> 00:18:36.080 align:start position:0%
clarify that is
 
00:18:38.470 --> 00:18:38.480 align:start position:0%
is we're not going to do state is not
 
00:18:40.310 --> 00:18:40.320 align:start position:0%
engaged in illegal business so some of
 
00:18:41.870 --> 00:18:41.880 align:start position:0%
those some some of that language will
 
00:18:44.789 --> 00:18:44.799 align:start position:0%
have to probably be reviewed and again
 
00:18:48.350 --> 00:18:48.360 align:start position:0%
we're not the right uh group to speak
 
00:18:50.390 --> 00:18:50.400 align:start position:0%
about the liability but that's what
 
00:18:51.710 --> 00:18:51.720 align:start position:0%
we'll have to do work with the Attorney
 
00:18:54.510 --> 00:18:54.520 align:start position:0%
General's office on that thank you so I
 
00:18:56.470 --> 00:18:56.480 align:start position:0%
just want to make sure but at least one
 
00:18:58.029 --> 00:18:58.039 align:start position:0%
Bank the state's already doing business
 
00:18:59.870 --> 00:18:59.880 align:start position:0%
with follows the finson guidelines and
 
00:19:02.149 --> 00:19:02.159 align:start position:0%
would be willing to do business under
 
00:19:04.710 --> 00:19:04.720 align:start position:0%
the federal guidelines for working with
 
00:19:06.710 --> 00:19:06.720 align:start position:0%
cannabis that's my understand it right
 
00:19:09.470 --> 00:19:09.480 align:start position:0%
now Ryan I think you had a question yeah
 
00:19:11.990 --> 00:19:12.000 align:start position:0%
not so much question but just to kind of
 
00:19:15.110 --> 00:19:15.120 align:start position:0%
help uh with the conversation so um
 
00:19:18.230 --> 00:19:18.240 align:start position:0%
you're correct uh uh Treasurer um
 
00:19:21.029 --> 00:19:21.039 align:start position:0%
there's different tiers of of marijuana
 
00:19:24.029 --> 00:19:24.039 align:start position:0%
related businesses tier one is directly
 
00:19:26.110 --> 00:19:26.120 align:start position:0%
touching the product right so a little
 
00:19:27.789 --> 00:19:27.799 align:start position:0%
bit higher risk there's tier two and
 
00:19:30.669 --> 00:19:30.679 align:start position:0%
then tier three um you know I think what
 
00:19:33.669 --> 00:19:33.679 align:start position:0%
was proposed in 1598 where the state
 
00:19:36.270 --> 00:19:36.280 align:start position:0%
would be selling directly that created
 
00:19:38.750 --> 00:19:38.760 align:start position:0%
tier one marijuana level and so the risk
 
00:19:44.270 --> 00:19:44.280 align:start position:0%
was higher um this is fees and um and
 
00:19:48.110 --> 00:19:48.120 align:start position:0%
taxes um so lower level but again banks
 
00:19:50.190 --> 00:19:50.200 align:start position:0%
have different risk thresholds risk
 
00:19:53.190 --> 00:19:53.200 align:start position:0%
tolerances um you know we are aware of a
 
00:19:55.590 --> 00:19:55.600 align:start position:0%
number of banks that are interested in
 
00:19:58.470 --> 00:19:58.480 align:start position:0%
getting into it um and one of the things
 
00:20:01.909 --> 00:20:01.919 align:start position:0%
that during 1598 debate we did ask for
 
00:20:04.190 --> 00:20:04.200 align:start position:0%
was to make sure that those funds were
 
00:20:05.669 --> 00:20:05.679 align:start position:0%
separate and distinct from all other
 
00:20:08.110 --> 00:20:08.120 align:start position:0%
funds and that was to ensure that
 
00:20:09.590 --> 00:20:09.600 align:start position:0%
current banking
 
00:20:12.029 --> 00:20:12.039 align:start position:0%
relationship uh that the state has Isn't
 
00:20:15.270 --> 00:20:15.280 align:start position:0%
interrupted in the event that that um
 
00:20:17.510 --> 00:20:17.520 align:start position:0%
that bank didn't want to take uh those
 
00:20:19.430 --> 00:20:19.440 align:start position:0%
funds and then another bank could Step
 
00:20:22.230 --> 00:20:22.240 align:start position:0%
Up um but again we are aware of a number
 
00:20:25.190 --> 00:20:25.200 align:start position:0%
of banks that are um interested in
 
00:20:29.029 --> 00:20:29.039 align:start position:0%
getting into into uh marijuana
 
00:20:31.430 --> 00:20:31.440 align:start position:0%
banking marijuana related businesses um
 
00:20:34.950 --> 00:20:34.960 align:start position:0%
and again this is a lower tier um that
 
00:20:38.909 --> 00:20:38.919 align:start position:0%
we're discussing in this bill so great
 
00:20:41.070 --> 00:20:41.080 align:start position:0%
thank you any other questions from the
 
00:20:45.270 --> 00:20:45.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:48.710 --> 00:20:48.720 align:start position:0%
chairman just one one statement that the
 
00:20:50.789 --> 00:20:50.799 align:start position:0%
treasurer made that we're fine with a
 
00:20:53.070 --> 00:20:53.080 align:start position:0%
monthly reimbursement instead of a
 
00:20:55.070 --> 00:20:55.080 align:start position:0%
quarterly reimbursement The Liquor
 
00:20:57.230 --> 00:20:57.240 align:start position:0%
Commission is fine with that the model
 
00:20:59.710 --> 00:20:59.720 align:start position:0%
was just to to collect those franchise
 
00:21:01.909 --> 00:21:01.919 align:start position:0%
fees and make it a little bit easier on
 
00:21:04.190 --> 00:21:04.200 align:start position:0%
the franchisee to do it a quarterly but
 
00:21:06.510 --> 00:21:06.520 align:start position:0%
monthly would be fine as
 
00:21:09.110 --> 00:21:09.120 align:start position:0%
well thank
 
00:21:12.070 --> 00:21:12.080 align:start position:0%
you yeah I can also just on the safe
 
00:21:14.190 --> 00:21:14.200 align:start position:0%
Banking Act just to give an update on
 
00:21:17.190 --> 00:21:17.200 align:start position:0%
that um it's passed the house seven
 
00:21:18.909 --> 00:21:18.919 align:start position:0%
times it's always failed in the Senate
 
00:21:21.669 --> 00:21:21.679 align:start position:0%
our senate committee um a month or so
 
00:21:24.590 --> 00:21:24.600 align:start position:0%
ago uh marked up and passed it I think
 
00:21:27.350 --> 00:21:27.360 align:start position:0%
it was 149 so it's it is making some
 
00:21:27.360 --> 00:21:28.669 align:start position:0%
it was 149 so it's it is making some
Headway

00:21:28.669 --> 00:21:28.679 align:start position:0%
Headway
 
00:21:30.950 --> 00:21:30.960 align:start position:0%
um you know it has the support in the
 
00:21:33.390 --> 00:21:33.400 align:start position:0%
house the question and they Advocates
 
00:21:35.510 --> 00:21:35.520 align:start position:0%
feel that they do have the votes in the
 
00:21:37.230 --> 00:21:37.240 align:start position:0%
Cent they have 60 votes in the Senate to
 
00:21:39.590 --> 00:21:39.600 align:start position:0%
get it through so um obviously a lot has
 
00:21:41.870 --> 00:21:41.880 align:start position:0%
changed there's a lot going on right now
 
00:21:43.470 --> 00:21:43.480 align:start position:0%
down in Congress keeping the government
 
00:21:46.230 --> 00:21:46.240 align:start position:0%
open but uh we do they we have been told
 
00:21:49.149 --> 00:21:49.159 align:start position:0%
that that is one of their priorities so
 
00:21:51.990 --> 00:21:52.000 align:start position:0%
um if that is if that does pass that
 
00:21:54.590 --> 00:21:54.600 align:start position:0%
will make it take uh a lot of these
 
00:21:55.950 --> 00:21:55.960 align:start position:0%
questions off the table and make it
 
00:21:58.590 --> 00:21:58.600 align:start position:0%
easier so great
 
00:21:58.600 --> 00:21:59.350 align:start position:0%
easier so great
anything

00:21:59.350 --> 00:21:59.360 align:start position:0%
anything
 
00:22:01.510 --> 00:22:01.520 align:start position:0%
else thank you madam treasure for coming
 
00:22:03.269 --> 00:22:03.279 align:start position:0%
appreciate it very much thank you very
 
00:22:05.029 --> 00:22:05.039 align:start position:0%
much all right so we're going to
 
00:22:08.470 --> 00:22:08.480 align:start position:0%
continue on in the bill um we last left
 
00:22:11.510 --> 00:22:11.520 align:start position:0%
off on page at the top of page 15 letter
 
00:22:13.269 --> 00:22:13.279 align:start position:0%
F and I'm just going to kind of remind
 
00:22:15.470 --> 00:22:15.480 align:start position:0%
people what that section is talking
 
00:22:18.269 --> 00:22:18.279 align:start position:0%
about um so we go back to page 13 number
 
00:22:20.789 --> 00:22:20.799 align:start position:0%
four um we're talking about rulemaking
 
00:22:23.990 --> 00:22:24.000 align:start position:0%
at this point right uh not later than we
 
00:22:25.750 --> 00:22:25.760 align:start position:0%
decided on 30 months after the effective
 
00:22:27.149 --> 00:22:27.159 align:start position:0%
date of the section the commission shall
 
00:22:30.510 --> 00:22:30.520 align:start position:0%
initiate Ru making process to 90 uh 541a
 
00:22:32.269 --> 00:22:32.279 align:start position:0%
for regulations on Advertising
 
00:22:34.430 --> 00:22:34.440 align:start position:0%
manufacturer sale of cannabis cannabis
 
00:22:36.470 --> 00:22:36.480 align:start position:0%
products cannabis accessories and the
 
00:22:38.909 --> 00:22:38.919 align:start position:0%
rulle shall include the following and we
 
00:22:42.070 --> 00:22:42.080 align:start position:0%
made it all the way to F on page 15 so
 
00:22:43.549 --> 00:22:43.559 align:start position:0%
again we're talking about the fact that
 
00:22:47.070 --> 00:22:47.080 align:start position:0%
liquor uh needs to adopt rules and this
 
00:22:49.029 --> 00:22:49.039 align:start position:0%
is relative to packaging product
 
00:22:51.110 --> 00:22:51.120 align:start position:0%
manufacturing labeling requirements for
 
00:22:53.269 --> 00:22:53.279 align:start position:0%
cannabis and cannabis products included
 
00:22:55.830 --> 00:22:55.840 align:start position:0%
but not limited to and we have a list of
 
00:22:59.110 --> 00:22:59.120 align:start position:0%
things talking about how package
 
00:23:02.909 --> 00:23:02.919 align:start position:0%
um uh would look what would look like
 
00:23:07.510 --> 00:23:07.520 align:start position:0%
so Chief I'm not sure U Mr M sorry I
 
00:23:09.789 --> 00:23:09.799 align:start position:0%
didn't mean I meant the the liquor Chief
 
00:23:09.799 --> 00:23:11.630 align:start position:0%
didn't mean I meant the the liquor Chief
there

00:23:11.630 --> 00:23:11.640 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:23:14.590 --> 00:23:14.600 align:start position:0%
um given in light of your most recent
 
00:23:16.549 --> 00:23:16.559 align:start position:0%
Adventures um do you have any comments
 
00:23:18.909 --> 00:23:18.919 align:start position:0%
about anything we might add in here to
 
00:23:20.990 --> 00:23:21.000 align:start position:0%
make sure it's clear and distinct for
 
00:23:23.350 --> 00:23:23.360 align:start position:0%
packaging and and labeling that you know
 
00:23:24.950 --> 00:23:24.960 align:start position:0%
what it can or cannot contain that we
 
00:23:26.870 --> 00:23:26.880 align:start position:0%
might want to put specifically in the
 
00:23:26.880 --> 00:23:28.990 align:start position:0%
might want to put specifically in the
bill

00:23:28.990 --> 00:23:29.000 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:23:30.630 --> 00:23:30.640 align:start position:0%
the only thing I would add Mr chairman
 
00:23:32.269 --> 00:23:32.279 align:start position:0%
is we've done a lot of study with the
 
00:23:35.070 --> 00:23:35.080 align:start position:0%
states that have legalized the 24 states
 
00:23:36.830 --> 00:23:36.840 align:start position:0%
that have legalized cannabis at this
 
00:23:39.630 --> 00:23:39.640 align:start position:0%
point and we would just continue to uh
 
00:23:42.149 --> 00:23:42.159 align:start position:0%
look at what they're doing and model
 
00:23:44.990 --> 00:23:45.000 align:start position:0%
what we're doing off after the what we
 
00:23:46.750 --> 00:23:46.760 align:start position:0%
feel are the states that are doing it
 
00:23:49.590 --> 00:23:49.600 align:start position:0%
the best which
 
00:23:51.909 --> 00:23:51.919 align:start position:0%
are which are there's a few out there
 
00:23:54.750 --> 00:23:54.760 align:start position:0%
that are doing it well okay so going
 
00:23:57.430 --> 00:23:57.440 align:start position:0%
through uh Tim just kind of a question
 
00:24:00.669 --> 00:24:00.679 align:start position:0%
for chairman Mica you know with with the
 
00:24:02.230 --> 00:24:02.240 align:start position:0%
uh recent push back of the micro
 
00:24:05.310 --> 00:24:05.320 align:start position:0%
breweries on packaging um for for their
 
00:24:07.669 --> 00:24:07.679 align:start position:0%
micro brew containers um some containing
 
00:24:09.669 --> 00:24:09.679 align:start position:0%
cartoons that look like you know Finding
 
00:24:12.110 --> 00:24:12.120 align:start position:0%
Nemo do you think do you think you guys
 
00:24:14.870 --> 00:24:14.880 align:start position:0%
are um going to be able to stop stuff
 
00:24:18.830 --> 00:24:18.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:22.430 --> 00:24:22.440 align:start position:0%
packaging I do this is the way I we look
 
00:24:25.070 --> 00:24:25.080 align:start position:0%
at it we would we would ask that the
 
00:24:28.430 --> 00:24:28.440 align:start position:0%
packaging uh much like beer Laing or
 
00:24:31.110 --> 00:24:31.120 align:start position:0%
anything else that we inspect we would
 
00:24:33.269 --> 00:24:33.279 align:start position:0%
we would set a criteria out that it
 
00:24:36.590 --> 00:24:36.600 align:start position:0%
can't be that cannot happen in the state
 
00:24:38.710 --> 00:24:38.720 align:start position:0%
and would ask manufacturers because I'm
 
00:24:40.669 --> 00:24:40.679 align:start position:0%
sure there's manufacturers in other
 
00:24:43.029 --> 00:24:43.039 align:start position:0%
states that are interested in coming to
 
00:24:45.630 --> 00:24:45.640 align:start position:0%
ma uh coming to New Hampshire with their
 
00:24:48.149 --> 00:24:48.159 align:start position:0%
products we would ask that those those
 
00:24:51.990 --> 00:24:52.000 align:start position:0%
labels or packages uh meet our standards
 
00:24:53.710 --> 00:24:53.720 align:start position:0%
rather than the standards of other
 
00:24:56.630 --> 00:24:56.640 align:start position:0%
states so I certainly think that it's
 
00:24:58.909 --> 00:24:58.919 align:start position:0%
something that we can do
 
00:25:01.430 --> 00:25:01.440 align:start position:0%
representative I think if you look again
 
00:25:05.230 --> 00:25:05.240 align:start position:0%
at the rules under F uh small I number D
 
00:25:07.830 --> 00:25:07.840 align:start position:0%
and E right we talk about athletes right
 
00:25:09.669 --> 00:25:09.679 align:start position:0%
not being depicted of so it's no way
 
00:25:11.669 --> 00:25:11.679 align:start position:0%
informed being a performance-enhancing
 
00:25:14.029 --> 00:25:14.039 align:start position:0%
product and the same with cartoon you
 
00:25:15.630 --> 00:25:15.640 align:start position:0%
know characters not packaged for
 
00:25:17.669 --> 00:25:17.679 align:start position:0%
featuring illustration subject matter
 
00:25:18.950 --> 00:25:18.960 align:start position:0%
attributes that are consistent with
 
00:25:20.470 --> 00:25:20.480 align:start position:0%
products marketed towards Children and
 
00:25:22.070 --> 00:25:22.080 align:start position:0%
Youth right so they have some pretty
 
00:25:24.430 --> 00:25:24.440 align:start position:0%
clear guidelines that they'll do and and
 
00:25:26.789 --> 00:25:26.799 align:start position:0%
maybe even ad in rules a little tighter
 
00:25:29.669 --> 00:25:29.679 align:start position:0%
guidelines as well so um I think Jordan
 
00:25:32.590 --> 00:25:32.600 align:start position:0%
you have a yeah two quick comments
 
00:25:35.430 --> 00:25:35.440 align:start position:0%
there's some grammatical errors in the
 
00:25:39.630 --> 00:25:39.640 align:start position:0%
U uh list of the laundry list where at
 
00:25:43.350 --> 00:25:43.360 align:start position:0%
oh for example um but not limited to the
 
00:25:45.630 --> 00:25:45.640 align:start position:0%
following statements on the packaging
 
00:25:47.470 --> 00:25:47.480 align:start position:0%
our fault that are
 
00:25:47.480 --> 00:25:49.269 align:start position:0%
our fault that are
faults

00:25:49.269 --> 00:25:49.279 align:start position:0%
faults
 
00:25:52.990 --> 00:25:53.000 align:start position:0%
Etc that type of U language
 
00:25:56.630 --> 00:25:56.640 align:start position:0%
occurs um but a question to The Liquor
 
00:25:58.950 --> 00:25:58.960 align:start position:0%
Commission go ahead
 
00:26:00.830 --> 00:26:00.840 align:start position:0%
you've already been in discussion with
 
00:26:02.549 --> 00:26:02.559 align:start position:0%
the 24 other states you already have
 
00:26:04.590 --> 00:26:04.600 align:start position:0%
some idea what the rules are is it going
 
00:26:06.510 --> 00:26:06.520 align:start position:0%
to take 30 months or can it be done in a
 
00:26:07.990 --> 00:26:08.000 align:start position:0%
month or
 
00:26:11.389 --> 00:26:11.399 align:start position:0%
two the 30 months representative doesn't
 
00:26:15.870 --> 00:26:15.880 align:start position:0%
represent what the uh the packaging
 
00:26:18.950 --> 00:26:18.960 align:start position:0%
would represent the 30 months represents
 
00:26:20.950 --> 00:26:20.960 align:start position:0%
our business partners being able to come
 
00:26:23.190 --> 00:26:23.200 align:start position:0%
to the state and set up growth
 
00:26:25.990 --> 00:26:26.000 align:start position:0%
facilities and Manufacturing facilities
 
00:26:28.029 --> 00:26:28.039 align:start position:0%
that's where that's where the the lead
 
00:26:30.430 --> 00:26:30.440 align:start position:0%
time is is
 
00:26:34.269 --> 00:26:34.279 align:start position:0%
necessary what follow up Mr jacket well
 
00:26:36.190 --> 00:26:36.200 align:start position:0%
the my understanding is that you've
 
00:26:37.510 --> 00:26:37.520 align:start position:0%
already got a line of people that are
 
00:26:41.310 --> 00:26:41.320 align:start position:0%
ready to come in uh they need rules in
 
00:26:45.389 --> 00:26:45.399 align:start position:0%
order to set up so besides them coming
 
00:26:48.470 --> 00:26:48.480 align:start position:0%
in they're ready to come in but what
 
00:26:51.269 --> 00:26:51.279 align:start position:0%
they need is a set of rules for
 
00:26:54.470 --> 00:26:54.480 align:start position:0%
operation so by if it's going to take 30
 
00:26:57.269 --> 00:26:57.279 align:start position:0%
months for them to set up and 30 months
 
00:26:59.590 --> 00:26:59.600 align:start position:0%
to put in the ruled you're now talking
 
00:27:00.990 --> 00:27:01.000 align:start position:0%
60 mon you're
 
00:27:04.230 --> 00:27:04.240 align:start position:0%
talking a rather long period of
 
00:27:07.149 --> 00:27:07.159 align:start position:0%
time it's my understanding in that 30
 
00:27:09.269 --> 00:27:09.279 align:start position:0%
months representative that the rules
 
00:27:12.310 --> 00:27:12.320 align:start position:0%
would would be uh would be written and
 
00:27:15.389 --> 00:27:15.399 align:start position:0%
sent to jail car in conjunction with our
 
00:27:17.549 --> 00:27:17.559 align:start position:0%
business partners coming to the state
 
00:27:19.590 --> 00:27:19.600 align:start position:0%
and setting up their businesses so the
 
00:27:22.990 --> 00:27:23.000 align:start position:0%
30 months is a is just that 30 months
 
00:27:25.470 --> 00:27:25.480 align:start position:0%
and if it happens in 22 months or 18
 
00:27:27.909 --> 00:27:27.919 align:start position:0%
months so be it but we just want to make
 
00:27:30.950 --> 00:27:30.960 align:start position:0%
sure that we're not in a position where
 
00:27:33.630 --> 00:27:33.640 align:start position:0%
we're asking people
 
00:27:36.630 --> 00:27:36.640 align:start position:0%
to where we're asking franchisees to
 
00:27:38.470 --> 00:27:38.480 align:start position:0%
open stores when we don't have enough
 
00:27:42.110 --> 00:27:42.120 align:start position:0%
product for them to sell so chief of
 
00:27:44.070 --> 00:27:44.080 align:start position:0%
Comm if I can so again you're talking
 
00:27:45.710 --> 00:27:45.720 align:start position:0%
about a staggered set of rules coming in
 
00:27:47.750 --> 00:27:47.760 align:start position:0%
it's a not 30 months is a not to exceed
 
00:27:49.269 --> 00:27:49.279 align:start position:0%
number right you have to have everything
 
00:27:51.789 --> 00:27:51.799 align:start position:0%
done within 30 months but I I would
 
00:27:54.029 --> 00:27:54.039 align:start position:0%
assume that I'm serving on jail car and
 
00:27:55.950 --> 00:27:55.960 align:start position:0%
I'm praying you don't show up with a a
 
00:27:57.830 --> 00:27:57.840 align:start position:0%
stack of rules like this for all all
 
00:27:59.710 --> 00:27:59.720 align:start position:0%
levels of the uh but you're going to do
 
00:28:01.950 --> 00:28:01.960 align:start position:0%
like assume you'll do cultivation first
 
00:28:03.509 --> 00:28:03.519 align:start position:0%
and then move into manufacturing and
 
00:28:05.549 --> 00:28:05.559 align:start position:0%
then move into the distribution and then
 
00:28:07.710 --> 00:28:07.720 align:start position:0%
move into retail so as the people who
 
00:28:09.590 --> 00:28:09.600 align:start position:0%
have to stage and stagger will get ready
 
00:28:11.350 --> 00:28:11.360 align:start position:0%
so when you get to the final product of
 
00:28:13.590 --> 00:28:13.600 align:start position:0%
the franchise store there's already
 
00:28:14.950 --> 00:28:14.960 align:start position:0%
product on the back end to deal with
 
00:28:16.509 --> 00:28:16.519 align:start position:0%
that is that is that an accurate
 
00:28:18.230 --> 00:28:18.240 align:start position:0%
assessment of a stagger can't say it
 
00:28:21.430 --> 00:28:21.440 align:start position:0%
better than you said it yes yeah great
 
00:28:25.549 --> 00:28:25.559 align:start position:0%
so uh separ he's good uh Mr chair I have
 
00:28:27.870 --> 00:28:27.880 align:start position:0%
a question about the process um um I
 
00:28:30.190 --> 00:28:30.200 align:start position:0%
know you've been collecting God rails
 
00:28:33.509 --> 00:28:33.519 align:start position:0%
from um subject am experts that have
 
00:28:36.990 --> 00:28:37.000 align:start position:0%
come in uh I submitted a god rails from
 
00:28:39.870 --> 00:28:39.880 align:start position:0%
the prevention Community um I don't
 
00:28:41.750 --> 00:28:41.760 align:start position:0%
think we need to go through each and
 
00:28:44.630 --> 00:28:44.640 align:start position:0%
every one of those right now will o OLS
 
00:28:47.909 --> 00:28:47.919 align:start position:0%
be integrating these into the the marked
 
00:28:49.630 --> 00:28:49.640 align:start position:0%
up copy that we're doing today so I was
 
00:28:51.710 --> 00:28:51.720 align:start position:0%
hoping to have a Redline product by
 
00:28:53.230 --> 00:28:53.240 align:start position:0%
today that we could see all the changes
 
00:28:55.389 --> 00:28:55.399 align:start position:0%
we've made up to this date but yes
 
00:28:57.110 --> 00:28:57.120 align:start position:0%
ultimately we'll end up with a Redline
 
00:28:58.549 --> 00:28:58.559 align:start position:0%
product with all the additions and
 
00:29:00.350 --> 00:29:00.360 align:start position:0%
subtractions that we've done to the from
 
00:29:02.549 --> 00:29:02.559 align:start position:0%
the draft bill from the that's after
 
00:29:05.470 --> 00:29:05.480 align:start position:0%
after our yeah after we're all done okay
 
00:29:07.909 --> 00:29:07.919 align:start position:0%
and remember the biggest in through all
 
00:29:09.630 --> 00:29:09.640 align:start position:0%
of these rule making stuff you'll always
 
00:29:12.830 --> 00:29:12.840 align:start position:0%
see the language as um Li you know not
 
00:29:14.950 --> 00:29:14.960 align:start position:0%
not limited too right and the argument
 
00:29:17.389 --> 00:29:17.399 align:start position:0%
is that we may not put it in the law but
 
00:29:19.750 --> 00:29:19.760 align:start position:0%
the liquor can take the sheet that
 
00:29:21.430 --> 00:29:21.440 align:start position:0%
you've submitted and integrate into that
 
00:29:23.149 --> 00:29:23.159 align:start position:0%
rules anyway even though we didn't
 
00:29:26.070 --> 00:29:26.080 align:start position:0%
specifically outline that right there's
 
00:29:29.990 --> 00:29:30.000 align:start position:0%
there's 12 we have 12 suggestions um on
 
00:29:33.190 --> 00:29:33.200 align:start position:0%
packaging and also uh several warnings
 
00:29:34.789 --> 00:29:34.799 align:start position:0%
and I don't want to hold up the process
 
00:29:36.789 --> 00:29:36.799 align:start position:0%
by going through each one of these right
 
00:29:38.350 --> 00:29:38.360 align:start position:0%
now but we we we can integrate that into
 
00:29:40.430 --> 00:29:40.440 align:start position:0%
the recommendation so the one thing I
 
00:29:41.750 --> 00:29:41.760 align:start position:0%
I'll remind the committee is that there
 
00:29:44.750 --> 00:29:44.760 align:start position:0%
are things we're not agreeing on right
 
00:29:46.190 --> 00:29:46.200 align:start position:0%
uh I'm gon I'm going to go back to my
 
00:29:47.470 --> 00:29:47.480 align:start position:0%
favorite topic right now is a public
 
00:29:48.909 --> 00:29:48.919 align:start position:0%
consumption argument we're having right
 
00:29:50.389 --> 00:29:50.399 align:start position:0%
now what happens on a first offense what
 
00:29:52.110 --> 00:29:52.120 align:start position:0%
happens on a subsequent offense right I
 
00:29:53.669 --> 00:29:53.679 align:start position:0%
think we all agree that subsequent
 
00:29:55.909 --> 00:29:55.919 align:start position:0%
offense should have uh an enhanced
 
00:29:57.990 --> 00:29:58.000 align:start position:0%
penalty over a first offense we just
 
00:29:59.830 --> 00:29:59.840 align:start position:0%
can't get to what what it looks like
 
00:30:01.789 --> 00:30:01.799 align:start position:0%
right and so what I anticipate is we'll
 
00:30:03.870 --> 00:30:03.880 align:start position:0%
go back we'll modify that section to say
 
00:30:05.909 --> 00:30:05.919 align:start position:0%
that that first offense that a
 
00:30:07.830 --> 00:30:07.840 align:start position:0%
subsequent offense will have an enhanced
 
00:30:09.669 --> 00:30:09.679 align:start position:0%
penalty but we're going to leave it to
 
00:30:11.310 --> 00:30:11.320 align:start position:0%
the policy Committee in the house to
 
00:30:12.389 --> 00:30:12.399 align:start position:0%
decide what that looks like because
 
00:30:14.110 --> 00:30:14.120 align:start position:0%
we're not going to come to an agreement
 
00:30:15.389 --> 00:30:15.399 align:start position:0%
right and we'll let the people in the
 
00:30:17.310 --> 00:30:17.320 align:start position:0%
criminal justice committee make that
 
00:30:18.990 --> 00:30:19.000 align:start position:0%
determination because they they'll do it
 
00:30:20.029 --> 00:30:20.039 align:start position:0%
in align with all the other
 
00:30:21.710 --> 00:30:21.720 align:start position:0%
determination they had on other things
 
00:30:23.389 --> 00:30:23.399 align:start position:0%
like we're talking about public
 
00:30:25.630 --> 00:30:25.640 align:start position:0%
consumption uh public smoking in general
 
00:30:27.549 --> 00:30:27.559 align:start position:0%
and what the penalties are for that whe
 
00:30:30.269 --> 00:30:30.279 align:start position:0%
they're corollary or not so I I don't
 
00:30:32.630 --> 00:30:32.640 align:start position:0%
want to get bogged down too much in some
 
00:30:33.990 --> 00:30:34.000 align:start position:0%
details because again the policy
 
00:30:35.149 --> 00:30:35.159 align:start position:0%
committee is going to take this and tear
 
00:30:37.870 --> 00:30:37.880 align:start position:0%
it all apart our goal is to set a bill
 
00:30:39.950 --> 00:30:39.960 align:start position:0%
with the ideas of what we want and as
 
00:30:41.950 --> 00:30:41.960 align:start position:0%
much detail as we can that we where we
 
00:30:44.149 --> 00:30:44.159 align:start position:0%
can come to consensus and wherever we
 
00:30:45.909 --> 00:30:45.919 align:start position:0%
don't we can have a majority and
 
00:30:47.710 --> 00:30:47.720 align:start position:0%
Minority Report on that section so I
 
00:30:49.590 --> 00:30:49.600 align:start position:0%
anticipate on the public consumption
 
00:30:50.669 --> 00:30:50.679 align:start position:0%
component we're going to have a majority
 
00:30:51.830 --> 00:30:51.840 align:start position:0%
and minority we're going to have a
 
00:30:53.509 --> 00:30:53.519 align:start position:0%
standard statement that basically says
 
00:30:55.389 --> 00:30:55.399 align:start position:0%
the bill we think again I think it
 
00:30:56.870 --> 00:30:56.880 align:start position:0%
should be violation of misdemeanor I'm
 
00:30:58.190 --> 00:30:58.200 align:start position:0%
not willing will to set penalties and
 
00:31:00.710 --> 00:31:00.720 align:start position:0%
violation levels of I mean uh penalty
 
00:31:02.190 --> 00:31:02.200 align:start position:0%
levels but I'm willing to set the
 
00:31:05.269 --> 00:31:05.279 align:start position:0%
violation the levels and let the policy
 
00:31:06.950 --> 00:31:06.960 align:start position:0%
committee decide the majority report's
 
00:31:08.950 --> 00:31:08.960 align:start position:0%
going to say a second offense we think
 
00:31:10.590 --> 00:31:10.600 align:start position:0%
is should be significantly enhanced
 
00:31:12.230 --> 00:31:12.240 align:start position:0%
because you're knowingly violating the
 
00:31:13.710 --> 00:31:13.720 align:start position:0%
law at that point you've already been
 
00:31:15.909 --> 00:31:15.919 align:start position:0%
warned on a first offense there are some
 
00:31:16.990 --> 00:31:17.000 align:start position:0%
people here that disagree with that
 
00:31:19.509 --> 00:31:19.519 align:start position:0%
model and the minority can say we don't
 
00:31:21.110 --> 00:31:21.120 align:start position:0%
think so we're decriminalizing marijuana
 
00:31:22.230 --> 00:31:22.240 align:start position:0%
and we don't think that we should Rec
 
00:31:23.629 --> 00:31:23.639 align:start position:0%
criminalize another action involving
 
00:31:25.750 --> 00:31:25.760 align:start position:0%
marijuana that may be their statement
 
00:31:27.230 --> 00:31:27.240 align:start position:0%
but we'll have two different policies
 
00:31:29.110 --> 00:31:29.120 align:start position:0%
statements to where it is that the
 
00:31:31.269 --> 00:31:31.279 align:start position:0%
policy committee can take up and Define
 
00:31:33.669 --> 00:31:33.679 align:start position:0%
further does that make sense to
 
00:31:36.909 --> 00:31:36.919 align:start position:0%
everybody great all right so section F
 
00:31:38.950 --> 00:31:38.960 align:start position:0%
we've got uh Jordan's minor um
 
00:31:41.509 --> 00:31:41.519 align:start position:0%
correction and we've got the um some of
 
00:31:43.430 --> 00:31:43.440 align:start position:0%
the languaging that will give the licker
 
00:31:45.750 --> 00:31:45.760 align:start position:0%
for better enhancement on the regulation
 
00:31:47.830 --> 00:31:47.840 align:start position:0%
on on packaging is there any other
 
00:31:52.350 --> 00:31:52.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:55.230 --> 00:31:55.240 align:start position:0%
cover not see any moving
 
00:31:59.190 --> 00:31:59.200 align:start position:0%
on we will go to we're now on page 16
 
00:31:59.200 --> 00:32:05.350 align:start position:0%
on we will go to we're now on page 16
number

00:32:05.350 --> 00:32:05.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:08.350 --> 00:32:08.360 align:start position:0%
five Mr chair just a recommendation on
 
00:32:10.669 --> 00:32:10.679 align:start position:0%
five uh when it talks about a government
 
00:32:13.350 --> 00:32:13.360 align:start position:0%
ID perhaps uh there should be some
 
00:32:15.310 --> 00:32:15.320 align:start position:0%
consideration to using the same language
 
00:32:17.029 --> 00:32:17.039 align:start position:0%
used in the DMB
 
00:32:19.389 --> 00:32:19.399 align:start position:0%
statutes uh with respect to
 
00:32:22.190 --> 00:32:22.200 align:start position:0%
identification there is no definition
 
00:32:24.549 --> 00:32:24.559 align:start position:0%
earlier in this proposed legislation
 
00:32:27.629 --> 00:32:27.639 align:start position:0%
with respect to what a government ID is
 
00:32:29.549 --> 00:32:29.559 align:start position:0%
and so perhaps just using the current
 
00:32:32.509 --> 00:32:32.519 align:start position:0%
language that's used for DMV would be
 
00:32:37.909 --> 00:32:37.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:40.029 --> 00:32:40.039 align:start position:0%
question I'll see if I can dig that up
 
00:32:41.750 --> 00:32:41.760 align:start position:0%
and I'm okay with that if everyone else
 
00:32:43.310 --> 00:32:43.320 align:start position:0%
is if we have consistent language
 
00:32:45.230 --> 00:32:45.240 align:start position:0%
somewhere else in statute that talks
 
00:32:47.430 --> 00:32:47.440 align:start position:0%
about uh in liquor for example we have
 
00:32:48.909 --> 00:32:48.919 align:start position:0%
to have something that talks about what
 
00:32:50.950 --> 00:32:50.960 align:start position:0%
is a valid government ID for the
 
00:32:53.230 --> 00:32:53.240 align:start position:0%
purposes of identification and we can
 
00:32:55.190 --> 00:32:55.200 align:start position:0%
cop copy and use that language so it's
 
00:32:57.430 --> 00:32:57.440 align:start position:0%
consistent more for enforcement reasons
 
00:32:59.310 --> 00:32:59.320 align:start position:0%
for liquor they're using the same
 
00:33:02.029 --> 00:33:02.039 align:start position:0%
standard both for alcohol and marijuana
 
00:33:03.470 --> 00:33:03.480 align:start position:0%
considering the same people are going to
 
00:33:05.389 --> 00:33:05.399 align:start position:0%
be enforcing it makes sense to try to
 
00:33:07.669 --> 00:33:07.679 align:start position:0%
normalize that as much as
 
00:33:07.679 --> 00:33:09.389 align:start position:0%
normalize that as much as
possible

00:33:09.389 --> 00:33:09.399 align:start position:0%
possible
 
00:33:14.789 --> 00:33:14.799 align:start position:0%
Jordan um we have uh RSA 264 to consider
 
00:33:16.629 --> 00:33:16.639 align:start position:0%
as well regarding the scanning of the
 
00:33:18.629 --> 00:33:18.639 align:start position:0%
driver's license to make sure that that
 
00:33:20.389 --> 00:33:20.399 align:start position:0%
doesn't take
 
00:33:22.269 --> 00:33:22.279 align:start position:0%
place right I I don't think there's
 
00:33:23.549 --> 00:33:23.559 align:start position:0%
anywhere in the bill we're talking about
 
00:33:25.149 --> 00:33:25.159 align:start position:0%
the scanning and and retention of
 
00:33:28.710 --> 00:33:28.720 align:start position:0%
Licensing yeah I just want
 
00:33:30.350 --> 00:33:30.360 align:start position:0%
anything else belt and suspenders
 
00:33:32.870 --> 00:33:32.880 align:start position:0%
anything else on
 
00:33:32.880 --> 00:33:36.909 align:start position:0%
anything else on
five

00:33:36.909 --> 00:33:36.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:40.710 --> 00:33:40.720 align:start position:0%
six I think Jordan here's your no
 
00:33:50.310 --> 00:33:50.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:53.629 --> 00:33:53.639 align:start position:0%
data everybody okay with six it
 
00:33:54.870 --> 00:33:54.880 align:start position:0%
basically says the only way they can
 
00:33:56.509 --> 00:33:56.519 align:start position:0%
keep the data is if for marketing
 
00:34:01.029 --> 00:34:01.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:03.509 --> 00:34:03.519 align:start position:0%
allows number
 
00:34:05.430 --> 00:34:05.440 align:start position:0%
seven Mr
 
00:34:08.190 --> 00:34:08.200 align:start position:0%
chair yes we should probably change uh
 
00:34:10.669 --> 00:34:10.679 align:start position:0%
24 to 30 like we did in the other
 
00:34:14.190 --> 00:34:14.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:17.430 --> 00:34:17.440 align:start position:0%
reasonable anything else Qui question I
 
00:34:21.389 --> 00:34:21.399 align:start position:0%
know you been here go ahead um what if
 
00:34:23.230 --> 00:34:23.240 align:start position:0%
there was a recall there was a product
 
00:34:25.869 --> 00:34:25.879 align:start position:0%
feack something but in wouldn't be able
 
00:34:30.190 --> 00:34:30.200 align:start position:0%
to the consumer if there was something
 
00:34:33.030 --> 00:34:33.040 align:start position:0%
in the product good question Chief what
 
00:34:35.230 --> 00:34:35.240 align:start position:0%
do you have for what if we have a a
 
00:34:37.149 --> 00:34:37.159 align:start position:0%
batch that shows up bad we don't catch
 
00:34:38.990 --> 00:34:39.000 align:start position:0%
it until the independent review later
 
00:34:40.629 --> 00:34:40.639 align:start position:0%
after it's already been on the market
 
00:34:42.470 --> 00:34:42.480 align:start position:0%
how do we how we deal with notification
 
00:34:44.990 --> 00:34:45.000 align:start position:0%
to Consumers that a given batch might
 
00:34:46.430 --> 00:34:46.440 align:start position:0%
have a
 
00:34:48.710 --> 00:34:48.720 align:start position:0%
problem it's my understanding that
 
00:34:50.750 --> 00:34:50.760 align:start position:0%
nothing would make it to the Shelf until
 
00:34:54.270 --> 00:34:54.280 align:start position:0%
the the the process of inspecting it
 
00:34:57.510 --> 00:34:57.520 align:start position:0%
took place but then if if in in fact
 
00:34:59.870 --> 00:34:59.880 align:start position:0%
something was out there that had a
 
00:35:02.230 --> 00:35:02.240 align:start position:0%
problem in it we would would basically
 
00:35:04.990 --> 00:35:05.000 align:start position:0%
be through through the Liquor Commission
 
00:35:07.109 --> 00:35:07.119 align:start position:0%
that that that type of information would
 
00:35:09.430 --> 00:35:09.440 align:start position:0%
come out uh through our social media
 
00:35:11.950 --> 00:35:11.960 align:start position:0%
through our website and through uh
 
00:35:18.550 --> 00:35:18.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:21.310 --> 00:35:21.320 align:start position:0%
so so one second see what the next
 
00:35:21.320 --> 00:35:22.510 align:start position:0%
so so one second see what the next
number

00:35:22.510 --> 00:35:22.520 align:start position:0%
number
 
00:35:25.550 --> 00:35:25.560 align:start position:0%
is so maybe Chief this is talking about
 
00:35:28.750 --> 00:35:28.760 align:start position:0%
rules so maybe under we can add a number
 
00:35:31.630 --> 00:35:31.640 align:start position:0%
nine that just talks about uh
 
00:35:33.390 --> 00:35:33.400 align:start position:0%
notification of recall possible
 
00:35:36.069 --> 00:35:36.079 align:start position:0%
processes and just add add that you you
 
00:35:38.470 --> 00:35:38.480 align:start position:0%
have to require some sort of rules for
 
00:35:40.230 --> 00:35:40.240 align:start position:0%
notification does that seem reasonable
 
00:35:40.240 --> 00:35:41.270 align:start position:0%
notification does that seem reasonable
to

00:35:41.270 --> 00:35:41.280 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:35:43.910 --> 00:35:43.920 align:start position:0%
everybody so we'll add a number
 
00:35:46.310 --> 00:35:46.320 align:start position:0%
nine and it'll just be your recall
 
00:35:53.550 --> 00:35:53.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:57.190 --> 00:35:57.200 align:start position:0%
notification yes um currently if there's
 
00:35:59.750 --> 00:35:59.760 align:start position:0%
a batch of um I'll just used one that
 
00:36:02.069 --> 00:36:02.079 align:start position:0%
popped into my mind Blue Bunny Ice Cream
 
00:36:05.309 --> 00:36:05.319 align:start position:0%
they had a leria problem uh three or
 
00:36:08.109 --> 00:36:08.119 align:start position:0%
four years ago and all they did was
 
00:36:10.589 --> 00:36:10.599 align:start position:0%
public record as the uh commissioner
 
00:36:12.990 --> 00:36:13.000 align:start position:0%
just commented so I I think it's pretty
 
00:36:14.230 --> 00:36:14.240 align:start position:0%
I'm sure they have a process and I'm
 
00:36:16.589 --> 00:36:16.599 align:start position:0%
sure they can add something simply in
 
00:36:18.230 --> 00:36:18.240 align:start position:0%
again I think of you know just simple
 
00:36:20.870 --> 00:36:20.880 align:start position:0%
what's signage at the signage at the
 
00:36:22.910 --> 00:36:22.920 align:start position:0%
stores that kind of thing the franchise
 
00:36:24.910 --> 00:36:24.920 align:start position:0%
locations as well as social media posts
 
00:36:27.270 --> 00:36:27.280 align:start position:0%
for by both required probably be enough
 
00:36:28.990 --> 00:36:29.000 align:start position:0%
notice but there should be a process in
 
00:36:30.710 --> 00:36:30.720 align:start position:0%
place so we'll just add that they'll
 
00:36:32.630 --> 00:36:32.640 align:start position:0%
adopt rules relative to
 
00:36:34.950 --> 00:36:34.960 align:start position:0%
that so we're changing it to 30 we're
 
00:36:36.550 --> 00:36:36.560 align:start position:0%
adding in number eight about recalls
 
00:36:39.910 --> 00:36:39.920 align:start position:0%
everybody else okay with uh number seven
 
00:36:44.470 --> 00:36:44.480 align:start position:0%
Mr chair Mr chair excuse me good okay uh
 
00:36:47.270 --> 00:36:47.280 align:start position:0%
number seven uh from a public health and
 
00:36:51.230 --> 00:36:51.240 align:start position:0%
uh perspective we would uh recommend or
 
00:36:53.309 --> 00:36:53.319 align:start position:0%
consider for the commission to add or to
 
00:36:54.630 --> 00:36:54.640 align:start position:0%
ensure that there's
 
00:36:57.630 --> 00:36:57.640 align:start position:0%
information uh in the handout that uh
 
00:36:57.640 --> 00:36:58.550 align:start position:0%
information uh in the handout that uh
must

00:36:58.550 --> 00:36:58.560 align:start position:0%
must
 
00:37:01.470 --> 00:37:01.480 align:start position:0%
contain uh informative uh material
 
00:37:03.230 --> 00:37:03.240 align:start position:0%
regarding the health hazards associated
 
00:37:05.670 --> 00:37:05.680 align:start position:0%
with cannabis products including but not
 
00:37:09.030 --> 00:37:09.040 align:start position:0%
limited to restrictions uh on use by
 
00:37:11.910 --> 00:37:11.920 align:start position:0%
persons who are pregnant breastfeeding
 
00:37:13.950 --> 00:37:13.960 align:start position:0%
as well as health hazards associated
 
00:37:17.270 --> 00:37:17.280 align:start position:0%
with chronic use uh disorder of cannabis
 
00:37:20.470 --> 00:37:20.480 align:start position:0%
products uh just to make sure that those
 
00:37:23.430 --> 00:37:23.440 align:start position:0%
uh limitations or health hazards are are
 
00:37:25.230 --> 00:37:25.240 align:start position:0%
included in those informational handles
 
00:37:27.870 --> 00:37:27.880 align:start position:0%
particularly with respect to
 
00:37:30.670 --> 00:37:30.680 align:start position:0%
um potential health hazards uh
 
00:37:34.750 --> 00:37:34.760 align:start position:0%
associated with use by uh folks that are
 
00:37:37.430 --> 00:37:37.440 align:start position:0%
breastfeeding or
 
00:37:39.950 --> 00:37:39.960 align:start position:0%
pregnant doctor maybe we can just copy
 
00:37:42.390 --> 00:37:42.400 align:start position:0%
the information under
 
00:37:46.710 --> 00:37:46.720 align:start position:0%
30 on 17 P 17 it shows pretty
 
00:37:49.790 --> 00:37:49.800 align:start position:0%
specifically over Adent young adults
 
00:37:53.150 --> 00:37:53.160 align:start position:0%
breastfeeding pregnancy we just sort of
 
00:37:56.550 --> 00:37:56.560 align:start position:0%
use those same things in this section so
 
00:37:59.790 --> 00:37:59.800 align:start position:0%
so you're doing 318 f82 and that advice
 
00:38:01.829 --> 00:38:01.839 align:start position:0%
about potential risks of cannabis that
 
00:38:07.430 --> 00:38:07.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:10.870 --> 00:38:10.880 align:start position:0%
yeah Mr chair I would also add keep this
 
00:38:14.910 --> 00:38:14.920 align:start position:0%
product away from children so so
 
00:38:17.550 --> 00:38:17.560 align:start position:0%
let's so I guess my recommendation is we
 
00:38:19.790 --> 00:38:19.800 align:start position:0%
leave the language alone in seven and
 
00:38:21.670 --> 00:38:21.680 align:start position:0%
just look at when we get to the next
 
00:38:23.069 --> 00:38:23.079 align:start position:0%
page about the information because it
 
00:38:24.430 --> 00:38:24.440 align:start position:0%
talks about informational materials and
 
00:38:26.630 --> 00:38:26.640 align:start position:0%
warning labels and we can address it
 
00:38:28.109 --> 00:38:28.119 align:start position:0%
over and there rather than make an
 
00:38:29.750 --> 00:38:29.760 align:start position:0%
exhaust some sort of list and under
 
00:38:31.710 --> 00:38:31.720 align:start position:0%
number seven that sound
 
00:38:34.710 --> 00:38:34.720 align:start position:0%
reasonable okay see it and then number
 
00:38:36.790 --> 00:38:36.800 align:start position:0%
eight uh no later than 36 months after
 
00:38:37.870 --> 00:38:37.880 align:start position:0%
the effective data section the
 
00:38:38.870 --> 00:38:38.880 align:start position:0%
commission shall make written
 
00:38:40.390 --> 00:38:40.400 align:start position:0%
recommendation general court regarding
 
00:38:42.550 --> 00:38:42.560 align:start position:0%
regulations of hemp cabon oids synthetic
 
00:38:44.470 --> 00:38:44.480 align:start position:0%
avonoids intoxicating products derived
 
00:38:46.790 --> 00:38:46.800 align:start position:0%
from hemp including and then a list of
 
00:38:50.270 --> 00:38:50.280 align:start position:0%
ABC and D there um I think this is start
 
00:38:52.670 --> 00:38:52.680 align:start position:0%
we start talking into this area of Delta
 
00:38:55.069 --> 00:38:55.079 align:start position:0%
8 and Delta 10 cannabis products that
 
00:38:57.430 --> 00:38:57.440 align:start position:0%
are derived out of attemp but now are
 
00:38:59.990 --> 00:39:00.000 align:start position:0%
being synthetically altered um to change
 
00:39:01.790 --> 00:39:01.800 align:start position:0%
the makeup and so this just says that
 
00:39:03.910 --> 00:39:03.920 align:start position:0%
they need just they need to give us some
 
00:39:05.589 --> 00:39:05.599 align:start position:0%
advice the legislature in in a
 
00:39:06.829 --> 00:39:06.839 align:start position:0%
reasonable amount of time so that we
 
00:39:08.510 --> 00:39:08.520 align:start position:0%
could potentially put either rules or
 
00:39:11.230 --> 00:39:11.240 align:start position:0%
laws around that down the road that make
 
00:39:13.589 --> 00:39:13.599 align:start position:0%
sense we're okay with that
 
00:39:13.599 --> 00:39:15.430 align:start position:0%
sense we're okay with that
one

00:39:15.430 --> 00:39:15.440 align:start position:0%
one
 
00:39:19.670 --> 00:39:19.680 align:start position:0%
okay we're through that section um we
 
00:39:21.790 --> 00:39:21.800 align:start position:0%
added them nine about the recall and
 
00:39:23.750 --> 00:39:23.760 align:start position:0%
notifications and that's the end of that
 
00:39:24.990 --> 00:39:25.000 align:start position:0%
section we're moving on to the next
 
00:39:27.190 --> 00:39:27.200 align:start position:0%
section on page 1
 
00:39:30.710 --> 00:39:30.720 align:start position:0%
318 f8 um informational materials and
 
00:39:30.720 --> 00:39:33.470 align:start position:0%
318 f8 um informational materials and
warning

00:39:33.470 --> 00:39:33.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:40.430 --> 00:39:40.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:43.550 --> 00:39:43.560 align:start position:0%
okay number two um this is the
 
00:39:45.670 --> 00:39:45.680 align:start position:0%
informational handout and designed by
 
00:39:47.750 --> 00:39:47.760 align:start position:0%
the commission and consultation depart
 
00:39:49.510 --> 00:39:49.520 align:start position:0%
with the Department with all cannabis
 
00:39:51.190 --> 00:39:51.200 align:start position:0%
cannabis products sold to customers so
 
00:39:53.470 --> 00:39:53.480 align:start position:0%
these are the warning uh warning advice
 
00:39:56.710 --> 00:39:56.720 align:start position:0%
to handouts if you will as to possible
 
00:39:59.069 --> 00:39:59.079 align:start position:0%
issues um we see that talks about the
 
00:40:02.190 --> 00:40:02.200 align:start position:0%
risk of driving adverse uh effects to
 
00:40:04.670 --> 00:40:04.680 align:start position:0%
you to the youth um and effects of
 
00:40:06.430 --> 00:40:06.440 align:start position:0%
related to mind development potential
 
00:40:08.190 --> 00:40:08.200 align:start position:0%
adverse effects of risks including
 
00:40:12.109 --> 00:40:12.119 align:start position:0%
mental health and risks um for pregnancy
 
00:40:14.069 --> 00:40:14.079 align:start position:0%
um are some of the big bullet points I'm
 
00:40:15.630 --> 00:40:15.640 align:start position:0%
sure there may be others that are
 
00:40:17.630 --> 00:40:17.640 align:start position:0%
contained within the handout especially
 
00:40:20.470 --> 00:40:20.480 align:start position:0%
with the advice of of uh some of the
 
00:40:22.670 --> 00:40:22.680 align:start position:0%
handouts we they submitted regarding
 
00:40:22.680 --> 00:40:25.349 align:start position:0%
handouts we they submitted regarding
labeling

00:40:25.349 --> 00:40:25.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:25.359 --> 00:40:26.990 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:40:26.990 --> 00:40:27.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:40:28.470 --> 00:40:28.480 align:start position:0%
is there anything you see that's not
 
00:40:30.910 --> 00:40:30.920 align:start position:0%
listed here that is a big big line item
 
00:40:32.630 --> 00:40:32.640 align:start position:0%
we'd want to make sure we
 
00:40:34.990 --> 00:40:35.000 align:start position:0%
had and not leave it to the rul making
 
00:40:36.589 --> 00:40:36.599 align:start position:0%
Authority where they'll and the
 
00:40:36.599 --> 00:40:38.109 align:start position:0%
Authority where they'll and the
development

00:40:38.109 --> 00:40:38.119 align:start position:0%
development
 
00:40:40.630 --> 00:40:40.640 align:start position:0%
process well maybe we should add a risk
 
00:40:43.109 --> 00:40:43.119 align:start position:0%
of driving driving well it is right so
 
00:40:44.750 --> 00:40:44.760 align:start position:0%
that's right under number one if you
 
00:40:48.589 --> 00:40:48.599 align:start position:0%
look at Roman numeral 2 letter a small I
 
00:40:50.390 --> 00:40:50.400 align:start position:0%
the risk of driving on an influence eist
 
00:40:52.829 --> 00:40:52.839 align:start position:0%
in the factor doing so is
 
00:40:55.309 --> 00:40:55.319 align:start position:0%
illegal yeah perhaps
 
00:40:57.950 --> 00:40:57.960 align:start position:0%
uh consideration for adding the
 
00:40:57.960 --> 00:40:59.349 align:start position:0%
uh consideration for adding the
potential

00:40:59.349 --> 00:40:59.359 align:start position:0%
potential
 
00:41:01.710 --> 00:41:01.720 align:start position:0%
penalty uh if convicted for driving
 
00:41:05.309 --> 00:41:05.319 align:start position:0%
longair under cannabis may be helpful
 
00:41:08.230 --> 00:41:08.240 align:start position:0%
given the statistical increase in every
 
00:41:11.109 --> 00:41:11.119 align:start position:0%
state that's commercialized with respect
 
00:41:14.390 --> 00:41:14.400 align:start position:0%
to the number and increase of serious
 
00:41:16.430 --> 00:41:16.440 align:start position:0%
bodily injury and fatal motor vehicle
 
00:41:21.190 --> 00:41:21.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:24.349 --> 00:41:24.359 align:start position:0%
use so we'll put it under the small
 
00:41:25.630 --> 00:41:25.640 align:start position:0%
Roman numeral eye when it talks about
 
00:41:27.630 --> 00:41:27.640 align:start position:0%
the risk of driv and just add possible
 
00:41:30.990 --> 00:41:31.000 align:start position:0%
penties penalties for violation will be
 
00:41:33.030 --> 00:41:33.040 align:start position:0%
up to kind of language certainly the
 
00:41:34.510 --> 00:41:34.520 align:start position:0%
easiest way to make it is shorten it up
 
00:41:36.790 --> 00:41:36.800 align:start position:0%
it's a penalty up to a maximum of
 
00:41:40.230 --> 00:41:40.240 align:start position:0%
whatever yeah thank you that sound
 
00:41:43.390 --> 00:41:43.400 align:start position:0%
reasonable everybody yeah yeah okay
 
00:41:47.309 --> 00:41:47.319 align:start position:0%
anything else yep what Chief suggested
 
00:41:50.910 --> 00:41:50.920 align:start position:0%
was always go for the highest scary
 
00:41:53.030 --> 00:41:53.040 align:start position:0%
right right that's I that's we'll use up
 
00:41:56.589 --> 00:41:56.599 align:start position:0%
to language right up to I don't what the
 
00:42:00.190 --> 00:42:00.200 align:start position:0%
DWI is now what $1,200 for a possible
 
00:42:02.750 --> 00:42:02.760 align:start position:0%
maximum fine with penalty assessment and
 
00:42:06.710 --> 00:42:06.720 align:start position:0%
I think for uh a second offense or or or
 
00:42:10.990 --> 00:42:11.000 align:start position:0%
aggravated it's 2, or 2400 and up to a
 
00:42:13.910 --> 00:42:13.920 align:start position:0%
year in jail is the penalty so that
 
00:42:15.150 --> 00:42:15.160 align:start position:0%
would be the penalties that would be
 
00:42:19.750 --> 00:42:19.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:22.190 --> 00:42:22.200 align:start position:0%
Influence Mr chair Lieutenant did I get
 
00:42:25.750 --> 00:42:25.760 align:start position:0%
my numbers right all right good haven't
 
00:42:29.549 --> 00:42:29.559 align:start position:0%
put a bad ONN in over 20 years but um
 
00:42:33.270 --> 00:42:33.280 align:start position:0%
anything else Mr chair the only other um
 
00:42:35.589 --> 00:42:35.599 align:start position:0%
perhaps Gap here would be unless it's
 
00:42:38.790 --> 00:42:38.800 align:start position:0%
already contained elsewhere uh in the
 
00:42:41.710 --> 00:42:41.720 align:start position:0%
reference statute under 318 information
 
00:42:45.829 --> 00:42:45.839 align:start position:0%
with respect to um the health hazards
 
00:42:49.109 --> 00:42:49.119 align:start position:0%
that may arise from chronic use disorder
 
00:42:51.950 --> 00:42:51.960 align:start position:0%
which is a a burgeoning problem in the
 
00:42:54.390 --> 00:42:54.400 align:start position:0%
health industry with respect to cannabis
 
00:42:57.150 --> 00:42:57.160 align:start position:0%
use um those health effects might be
 
00:43:00.710 --> 00:43:00.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:04.109 --> 00:43:04.119 align:start position:0%
handout so uh Mr mikica maybe under that
 
00:43:06.910 --> 00:43:06.920 align:start position:0%
again Roman numeral three under a where
 
00:43:08.589 --> 00:43:08.599 align:start position:0%
it talks about potential adverse effects
 
00:43:10.710 --> 00:43:10.720 align:start position:0%
and other risk including mental health
 
00:43:12.510 --> 00:43:12.520 align:start position:0%
we can talk about chronic use disorder
 
00:43:15.910 --> 00:43:15.920 align:start position:0%
possibly there you know um reoccurring
 
00:43:17.910 --> 00:43:17.920 align:start position:0%
use you know whatever the word you want
 
00:43:19.710 --> 00:43:19.720 align:start position:0%
to use frequent use can result in
 
00:43:25.069 --> 00:43:25.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:25.079 --> 00:43:27.030 align:start position:0%
 
of

00:43:27.030 --> 00:43:27.040 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:43:28.309 --> 00:43:28.319 align:start position:0%
yeah I think that could go under D it
 
00:43:31.950 --> 00:43:31.960 align:start position:0%
says you know for um two yeah 2D it says
 
00:43:33.950 --> 00:43:33.960 align:start position:0%
how to recognize problematic or how to
 
00:43:36.549 --> 00:43:36.559 align:start position:0%
recognize maybe cannabis use disorder
 
00:43:38.230 --> 00:43:38.240 align:start position:0%
and how to obtain appropriate surfaces
 
00:43:38.240 --> 00:43:39.670 align:start position:0%
and how to obtain appropriate surfaces
or

00:43:39.670 --> 00:43:39.680 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:43:41.670 --> 00:43:41.680 align:start position:0%
treatment yes that's actually the
 
00:43:43.470 --> 00:43:43.480 align:start position:0%
language that we had
 
00:43:46.349 --> 00:43:46.359 align:start position:0%
here so put We'll add that under D that
 
00:43:48.589 --> 00:43:48.599 align:start position:0%
it will include something around about
 
00:43:52.150 --> 00:43:52.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:55.589 --> 00:43:55.599 align:start position:0%
of flipping to page on 18 going to e and
 
00:43:55.599 --> 00:43:57.430 align:start position:0%
of flipping to page on 18 going to e and
continuing

00:43:57.430 --> 00:43:57.440 align:start position:0%
continuing
 
00:44:00.510 --> 00:44:00.520 align:start position:0%
through anything in e or F that anybody
 
00:44:04.109 --> 00:44:04.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:07.230 --> 00:44:07.240 align:start position:0%
adjust seeing none we'll move on number
 
00:44:09.710 --> 00:44:09.720 align:start position:0%
three cannabis uh the the commission may
 
00:44:12.109 --> 00:44:12.119 align:start position:0%
require franchise cannabis retail stores
 
00:44:13.750 --> 00:44:13.760 align:start position:0%
so I'm gonna I'm just going to fix that
 
00:44:15.910 --> 00:44:15.920 align:start position:0%
language because we've changed the
 
00:44:17.950 --> 00:44:17.960 align:start position:0%
definitions um we got rid of one of
 
00:44:20.390 --> 00:44:20.400 align:start position:0%
those I can't remember which it was um
 
00:44:22.790 --> 00:44:22.800 align:start position:0%
um and it'll just say the that whe
 
00:44:24.349 --> 00:44:24.359 align:start position:0%
whether it's franchise cannabis retail
 
00:44:26.510 --> 00:44:26.520 align:start position:0%
outlets or just cannabis retail stores
 
00:44:28.470 --> 00:44:28.480 align:start position:0%
shall display informational posters and
 
00:44:31.030 --> 00:44:31.040 align:start position:0%
conspicuous locations about the risks da
 
00:44:34.230 --> 00:44:34.240 align:start position:0%
da da everybody okay with that with that
 
00:44:37.790 --> 00:44:37.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:37.800 --> 00:44:39.349 align:start position:0%
 
Amendment

00:44:39.349 --> 00:44:39.359 align:start position:0%
Amendment
 
00:44:43.710 --> 00:44:43.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:43.720 --> 00:44:45.390 align:start position:0%
 
four

00:44:45.390 --> 00:44:45.400 align:start position:0%
four
 
00:44:50.150 --> 00:44:50.160 align:start position:0%
Tim so you where it says conspicuous I
 
00:44:51.790 --> 00:44:51.800 align:start position:0%
don't think we want in conspicuous is
 
00:44:53.069 --> 00:44:53.079 align:start position:0%
that what you were just saying we we
 
00:44:55.309 --> 00:44:55.319 align:start position:0%
want to put the posters out in the open
 
00:44:57.150 --> 00:44:57.160 align:start position:0%
no no all I was doing is we have two
 
00:44:58.670 --> 00:44:58.680 align:start position:0%
definitions of retail stores and we
 
00:44:59.790 --> 00:44:59.800 align:start position:0%
struck one of them I don't remember
 
00:45:01.309 --> 00:45:01.319 align:start position:0%
which one we struck we just said they're
 
00:45:03.710 --> 00:45:03.720 align:start position:0%
cannabis retail stores I think and so in
 
00:45:05.870 --> 00:45:05.880 align:start position:0%
number three I'm just striking that well
 
00:45:06.829 --> 00:45:06.839 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to make sure the
 
00:45:08.790 --> 00:45:08.800 align:start position:0%
informational posters didn't didn't
 
00:45:11.069 --> 00:45:11.079 align:start position:0%
include the warnings and I don't want
 
00:45:13.150 --> 00:45:13.160 align:start position:0%
the warnings in a conspicuous location I
 
00:45:14.470 --> 00:45:14.480 align:start position:0%
want them out in the open where people
 
00:45:18.549 --> 00:45:18.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:20.790 --> 00:45:20.800 align:start position:0%
warnings conspicuous sounds to me like
 
00:45:23.230 --> 00:45:23.240 align:start position:0%
it mean I I I'm not an expert but
 
00:45:26.470 --> 00:45:26.480 align:start position:0%
conspicuous means like kind of hidden
 
00:45:27.870 --> 00:45:27.880 align:start position:0%
no conspicous is just the opposite of
 
00:45:30.510 --> 00:45:30.520 align:start position:0%
hidden it means out front very it's easy
 
00:45:32.870 --> 00:45:32.880 align:start position:0%
to see right if you're conspicous it's
 
00:45:39.470 --> 00:45:39.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:41.829 --> 00:45:41.839 align:start position:0%
see so we're okay with number three with
 
00:45:44.270 --> 00:45:44.280 align:start position:0%
the minor adjustment number
 
00:45:47.910 --> 00:45:47.920 align:start position:0%
four those about warning labels
 
00:45:53.150 --> 00:45:53.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:00.109 --> 00:46:00.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:02.069 --> 00:46:02.079 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair on a warning label
 
00:46:03.910 --> 00:46:03.920 align:start position:0%
recommendation we've looked at a number
 
00:46:07.990 --> 00:46:08.000 align:start position:0%
of warning labels and uh the current
 
00:46:10.589 --> 00:46:10.599 align:start position:0%
language there um perhaps may not
 
00:46:13.549 --> 00:46:13.559 align:start position:0%
be scientifically accurate we're looking
 
00:46:16.150 --> 00:46:16.160 align:start position:0%
at something more broad uh which would
 
00:46:19.390 --> 00:46:19.400 align:start position:0%
say consumption of this product
 
00:46:22.190 --> 00:46:22.200 align:start position:0%
intoxicating effect products
 
00:46:24.109 --> 00:46:24.119 align:start position:0%
intoxicating effects which may be
 
00:46:27.390 --> 00:46:27.400 align:start position:0%
delayed and impair
 
00:46:29.510 --> 00:46:29.520 align:start position:0%
the consumer for an undetermined amount
 
00:46:29.520 --> 00:46:31.670 align:start position:0%
the consumer for an undetermined amount
of

00:46:31.670 --> 00:46:31.680 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:46:34.910 --> 00:46:34.920 align:start position:0%
time well placing a time limit there
 
00:46:39.190 --> 00:46:39.200 align:start position:0%
would perhaps be limiting and give a
 
00:46:41.109 --> 00:46:41.119 align:start position:0%
full sense of
 
00:46:43.510 --> 00:46:43.520 align:start position:0%
security in fact inaccurate sense of
 
00:46:45.109 --> 00:46:45.119 align:start position:0%
security to
 
00:46:47.150 --> 00:46:47.160 align:start position:0%
someone I'm going to turn to the doctor
 
00:46:49.910 --> 00:46:49.920 align:start position:0%
there for for a good answer again would
 
00:46:51.710 --> 00:46:51.720 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure if any place else we ever
 
00:46:53.309 --> 00:46:53.319 align:start position:0%
use this kind of language don't use an
 
00:46:56.230 --> 00:46:56.240 align:start position:0%
alcohol um about consuming a beer May
 
00:46:57.950 --> 00:46:57.960 align:start position:0%
create intoxicating effects and Lasting
 
00:46:59.589 --> 00:46:59.599 align:start position:0%
up to you know we don't use that in any
 
00:47:02.069 --> 00:47:02.079 align:start position:0%
of our alcohol warning labels I'm a
 
00:47:04.270 --> 00:47:04.280 align:start position:0%
little I I don't know the signs around
 
00:47:05.670 --> 00:47:05.680 align:start position:0%
this so I I I think it would be
 
00:47:08.549 --> 00:47:08.559 align:start position:0%
reasonable just saying may be delayed
 
00:47:10.470 --> 00:47:10.480 align:start position:0%
and just take out the our language
 
00:47:12.150 --> 00:47:12.160 align:start position:0%
because that is you know we know that
 
00:47:14.510 --> 00:47:14.520 align:start position:0%
that's a big problem with Edibles um is
 
00:47:16.349 --> 00:47:16.359 align:start position:0%
that it's often very delayed and people
 
00:47:17.430 --> 00:47:17.440 align:start position:0%
just take more and more and that's why
 
00:47:19.630 --> 00:47:19.640 align:start position:0%
they end up in the emergency room so um
 
00:47:21.349 --> 00:47:21.359 align:start position:0%
but yeah I think that may be delayed and
 
00:47:23.630 --> 00:47:23.640 align:start position:0%
like you know yeah I think that that
 
00:47:32.510 --> 00:47:32.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:35.990 --> 00:47:36.000 align:start position:0%
anything else on five
 
00:47:39.109 --> 00:47:39.119 align:start position:0%
um I I have a question about um number
 
00:47:42.589 --> 00:47:42.599 align:start position:0%
four if we could just back up moment um
 
00:47:44.190 --> 00:47:44.200 align:start position:0%
we were talking about warning labels I
 
00:47:47.109 --> 00:47:47.119 align:start position:0%
know that we've had discussion about um
 
00:47:50.549 --> 00:47:50.559 align:start position:0%
inserts that have more comprehensive
 
00:47:53.309 --> 00:47:53.319 align:start position:0%
information such as what when you get a
 
00:47:56.829 --> 00:47:56.839 align:start position:0%
prescription drug um
 
00:47:59.390 --> 00:47:59.400 align:start position:0%
can we um is there another place here
 
00:48:01.069 --> 00:48:01.079 align:start position:0%
that we're talking about inserts or is
 
00:48:03.270 --> 00:48:03.280 align:start position:0%
this the appropriate level uh place
 
00:48:06.750 --> 00:48:06.760 align:start position:0%
number four warning labels or inserts
 
00:48:09.950 --> 00:48:09.960 align:start position:0%
Andor inserts they we can't put all of
 
00:48:12.109 --> 00:48:12.119 align:start position:0%
the warnings on a label it's it's not
 
00:48:15.549 --> 00:48:15.559 align:start position:0%
going to fit we've had that discussion
 
00:48:18.670 --> 00:48:18.680 align:start position:0%
yet inserts would allow us to um raise
 
00:48:20.630 --> 00:48:20.640 align:start position:0%
awareness on
 
00:48:25.470 --> 00:48:25.480 align:start position:0%
multiple um risk factors and harms so I
 
00:48:26.750 --> 00:48:26.760 align:start position:0%
guess the question that you're really
 
00:48:28.710 --> 00:48:28.720 align:start position:0%
asking is whether or not when we sell
 
00:48:31.109 --> 00:48:31.119 align:start position:0%
cannabis to or given will we give again
 
00:48:33.710 --> 00:48:33.720 align:start position:0%
a warning handout just saying here's in
 
00:48:35.710 --> 00:48:35.720 align:start position:0%
bigger larger print not just so fine
 
00:48:37.829 --> 00:48:37.839 align:start position:0%
print on the side of a bottle right or a
 
00:48:39.030 --> 00:48:39.040 align:start position:0%
side of on the side similar to
 
00:48:42.349 --> 00:48:42.359 align:start position:0%
interactions with uh prescription drugs
 
00:48:44.589 --> 00:48:44.599 align:start position:0%
when when we see these when we get these
 
00:48:47.150 --> 00:48:47.160 align:start position:0%
I happen to read those I I think that
 
00:48:49.030 --> 00:48:49.040 align:start position:0%
seems very reasonable I I also think
 
00:48:50.430 --> 00:48:50.440 align:start position:0%
that we shouldn't have language that
 
00:48:52.750 --> 00:48:52.760 align:start position:0%
says or it should say and there should
 
00:48:55.150 --> 00:48:55.160 align:start position:0%
be a warning label on everything um in
 
00:48:58.670 --> 00:48:58.680 align:start position:0%
addition to additional uh information um
 
00:49:01.549 --> 00:49:01.559 align:start position:0%
or Warnings um and I think we have this
 
00:49:04.069 --> 00:49:04.079 align:start position:0%
somewhere else but uh I'm not certain
 
00:49:07.190 --> 00:49:07.200 align:start position:0%
about rotating the inserts like you know
 
00:49:08.870 --> 00:49:08.880 align:start position:0%
every month it's a different insert so
 
00:49:11.430 --> 00:49:11.440 align:start position:0%
that we have some uh increase in
 
00:49:13.230 --> 00:49:13.240 align:start position:0%
education and it's hard to get
 
00:49:15.710 --> 00:49:15.720 align:start position:0%
everything out there in one shot so can
 
00:49:18.670 --> 00:49:18.680 align:start position:0%
we add shall include warning labels and
 
00:49:18.680 --> 00:49:21.230 align:start position:0%
we add shall include warning labels and
and

00:49:21.230 --> 00:49:21.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:24.030 --> 00:49:24.040 align:start position:0%
inserts so so me back up so again if we
 
00:49:25.309 --> 00:49:25.319 align:start position:0%
back up one page and we go back to
 
00:49:28.510 --> 00:49:28.520 align:start position:0%
number number two on the handout um that
 
00:49:29.910 --> 00:49:29.920 align:start position:0%
we were talking about the handout
 
00:49:33.150 --> 00:49:33.160 align:start position:0%
specifically says right the we'll fix
 
00:49:35.309 --> 00:49:35.319 align:start position:0%
the store language there on that first
 
00:49:37.030 --> 00:49:37.040 align:start position:0%
section with two types of stores we only
 
00:49:39.150 --> 00:49:39.160 align:start position:0%
have one now but shall include an
 
00:49:40.670 --> 00:49:40.680 align:start position:0%
informational handout designed by the
 
00:49:42.470 --> 00:49:42.480 align:start position:0%
commission and consultation of the
 
00:49:45.870 --> 00:49:45.880 align:start position:0%
department um with all cannabis products
 
00:49:47.309 --> 00:49:47.319 align:start position:0%
sold so it looks like they're already
 
00:49:49.750 --> 00:49:49.760 align:start position:0%
planning on handing them a a handout on
 
00:49:51.230 --> 00:49:51.240 align:start position:0%
cannabis products and the effects and
 
00:49:53.589 --> 00:49:53.599 align:start position:0%
warnings of that that's a full sheet
 
00:49:56.230 --> 00:49:56.240 align:start position:0%
type of or a hand or glossy H whatever
 
00:49:59.230 --> 00:49:59.240 align:start position:0%
they use but um they're on top of
 
00:50:00.349 --> 00:50:00.359 align:start position:0%
whatever sales stuff I think we're
 
00:50:02.710 --> 00:50:02.720 align:start position:0%
talking apples and oranges here I think
 
00:50:06.069 --> 00:50:06.079 align:start position:0%
this is more specific to the substance
 
00:50:09.630 --> 00:50:09.640 align:start position:0%
for for example if it's a you know a a
 
00:50:14.270 --> 00:50:14.280 align:start position:0%
uh THC uh edible gummy versus you know
 
00:50:17.430 --> 00:50:17.440 align:start position:0%
it would be I think be dependent on THC
 
00:50:21.030 --> 00:50:21.040 align:start position:0%
levels things things along that line but
 
00:50:23.589 --> 00:50:23.599 align:start position:0%
again not necessarily a brochure this is
 
00:50:26.030 --> 00:50:26.040 align:start position:0%
more I guess my my general I don't want
 
00:50:27.910 --> 00:50:27.920 align:start position:0%
to I don't want to pardon me I don't
 
00:50:30.150 --> 00:50:30.160 align:start position:0%
want to weigh down the department trying
 
00:50:31.470 --> 00:50:31.480 align:start position:0%
to figure out right hand out for the
 
00:50:32.549 --> 00:50:32.559 align:start position:0%
right product considering they're all
 
00:50:34.950 --> 00:50:34.960 align:start position:0%
cannabis products right and they can
 
00:50:38.150 --> 00:50:38.160 align:start position:0%
include like based on potency this your
 
00:50:39.990 --> 00:50:40.000 align:start position:0%
effects will be will change right they
 
00:50:42.349 --> 00:50:42.359 align:start position:0%
can add that kind of language into the
 
00:50:44.109 --> 00:50:44.119 align:start position:0%
into it but do you really want them to
 
00:50:46.230 --> 00:50:46.240 align:start position:0%
carry if they have 50 products 50
 
00:50:47.829 --> 00:50:47.839 align:start position:0%
different handouts well maybe it's maybe
 
00:50:50.030 --> 00:50:50.040 align:start position:0%
it's just one General handout that's
 
00:50:51.309 --> 00:50:51.319 align:start position:0%
well that's what I think section two
 
00:50:53.510 --> 00:50:53.520 align:start position:0%
does it's one General handout that talks
 
00:50:55.950 --> 00:50:55.960 align:start position:0%
about the effects and and that
 
00:50:58.230 --> 00:50:58.240 align:start position:0%
and so it'll be include you know
 
00:51:01.109 --> 00:51:01.119 align:start position:0%
numerous warnings with every sale with
 
00:51:03.470 --> 00:51:03.480 align:start position:0%
every sale numerous warnings and they'll
 
00:51:05.109 --> 00:51:05.119 align:start position:0%
get this with every sale correct it's
 
00:51:06.950 --> 00:51:06.960 align:start position:0%
not something they go to and pick up a
 
00:51:08.829 --> 00:51:08.839 align:start position:0%
or shore on correct based on number two
 
00:51:14.069 --> 00:51:14.079 align:start position:0%
it says um okay with all you know shall
 
00:51:15.870 --> 00:51:15.880 align:start position:0%
be include the information hand out with
 
00:51:17.710 --> 00:51:17.720 align:start position:0%
all cannabis and cannabis products sold
 
00:51:19.990 --> 00:51:20.000 align:start position:0%
to Consumers so they have to have a hand
 
00:51:23.950 --> 00:51:23.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:26.789 --> 00:51:26.799 align:start position:0%
sale in detail world it's called the bag
 
00:51:29.069 --> 00:51:29.079 align:start position:0%
stuffer so you just put it in has all
 
00:51:31.309 --> 00:51:31.319 align:start position:0%
the information all the warnings about
 
00:51:34.430 --> 00:51:34.440 align:start position:0%
everything that is included in the store
 
00:51:37.789 --> 00:51:37.799 align:start position:0%
for sale so it's a gen it's can be as
 
00:51:40.230 --> 00:51:40.240 align:start position:0%
general as you'd like it to be or as
 
00:51:43.069 --> 00:51:43.079 align:start position:0%
specific to individual products as you'd
 
00:51:44.470 --> 00:51:44.480 align:start position:0%
like it to
 
00:51:47.789 --> 00:51:47.799 align:start position:0%
be and you're in develop but by Statute
 
00:51:49.069 --> 00:51:49.079 align:start position:0%
by this you would have to develop that
 
00:51:50.829 --> 00:51:50.839 align:start position:0%
product and give it give it out at every
 
00:51:53.470 --> 00:51:53.480 align:start position:0%
sale when
 
00:51:56.069 --> 00:51:56.079 align:start position:0%
correct thank you
 
00:51:57.870 --> 00:51:57.880 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:52:00.910 --> 00:52:00.920 align:start position:0%
um where were
 
00:52:04.789 --> 00:52:04.799 align:start position:0%
we Mr chairman on five just a quick
 
00:52:07.510 --> 00:52:07.520 align:start position:0%
comment uh some of the manufacturers
 
00:52:10.829 --> 00:52:10.839 align:start position:0%
have have uh contacted us and asked that
 
00:52:15.390 --> 00:52:15.400 align:start position:0%
the word opaque be removed in d uh and
 
00:52:17.270 --> 00:52:17.280 align:start position:0%
only because some of this product is
 
00:52:20.030 --> 00:52:20.040 align:start position:0%
light sensitive and and some of the
 
00:52:23.270 --> 00:52:23.280 align:start position:0%
product comes in foil packages that have
 
00:52:25.430 --> 00:52:25.440 align:start position:0%
do you know would have some sort of a
 
00:52:28.030 --> 00:52:28.040 align:start position:0%
iing on it so that the word opaque be
 
00:52:30.190 --> 00:52:30.200 align:start position:0%
removed in D that just says child
 
00:52:33.510 --> 00:52:33.520 align:start position:0%
resistant packaging and then the uh we
 
00:52:36.630 --> 00:52:36.640 align:start position:0%
could add something we could add an e
 
00:52:38.789 --> 00:52:38.799 align:start position:0%
that says be packaged in opaque
 
00:52:41.829 --> 00:52:41.839 align:start position:0%
packaging or placed in an opaque bag at
 
00:52:44.470 --> 00:52:44.480 align:start position:0%
the time of the sale so in other words
 
00:52:47.309 --> 00:52:47.319 align:start position:0%
if somebody if if if the idea was we
 
00:52:49.270 --> 00:52:49.280 align:start position:0%
wanted to see what people were carrying
 
00:52:51.910 --> 00:52:51.920 align:start position:0%
out or be able to have see what people
 
00:52:54.349 --> 00:52:54.359 align:start position:0%
were carrying out the bag itself would
 
00:52:56.630 --> 00:52:56.640 align:start position:0%
be an opaque bag but the individual
 
00:52:58.950 --> 00:52:58.960 align:start position:0%
packaging of the products due to their
 
00:53:01.510 --> 00:53:01.520 align:start position:0%
light sensitivity some of them they're
 
00:53:04.390 --> 00:53:04.400 align:start position:0%
the opaque the actual opaque bag of each
 
00:53:08.870 --> 00:53:08.880 align:start position:0%
one uh wouldn't be a wise thing for them
 
00:53:10.390 --> 00:53:10.400 align:start position:0%
I mean I don't know about anybody else I
 
00:53:11.549 --> 00:53:11.559 align:start position:0%
really don't care whether the package
 
00:53:14.190 --> 00:53:14.200 align:start position:0%
they carrying out is opaque or not I
 
00:53:15.510 --> 00:53:15.520 align:start position:0%
think it's important that the product
 
00:53:18.589 --> 00:53:18.599 align:start position:0%
itself I understand the potency in UV
 
00:53:20.430 --> 00:53:20.440 align:start position:0%
light all that kind of thing so it makes
 
00:53:22.309 --> 00:53:22.319 align:start position:0%
sense that the packaging of the product
 
00:53:25.750 --> 00:53:25.760 align:start position:0%
might be not in a you know Opa package
 
00:53:26.630 --> 00:53:26.640 align:start position:0%
I don't know we're going go to the
 
00:53:27.870 --> 00:53:27.880 align:start position:0%
detail of telling you what kind of
 
00:53:29.190 --> 00:53:29.200 align:start position:0%
package you got to walk out of the store
 
00:53:31.710 --> 00:53:31.720 align:start position:0%
with a lot of them come in metal tins
 
00:53:33.589 --> 00:53:33.599 align:start position:0%
yeah that with uh you know the warning
 
00:53:36.390 --> 00:53:36.400 align:start position:0%
labels on them oil bags with the warning
 
00:53:38.870 --> 00:53:38.880 align:start position:0%
labels on them so does anybody have a
 
00:53:40.150 --> 00:53:40.160 align:start position:0%
strong opinion on whether the bag they
 
00:53:42.990 --> 00:53:43.000 align:start position:0%
carry out of the store is opaque or not
 
00:53:46.589 --> 00:53:46.599 align:start position:0%
opaque no we'll leave it to you
 
00:53:49.270 --> 00:53:49.280 align:start position:0%
Chief um good we're done with that
 
00:53:51.670 --> 00:53:51.680 align:start position:0%
section franchise fee
 
00:53:54.030 --> 00:53:54.040 align:start position:0%
imposed um we get to the money my fun
 
00:53:58.109 --> 00:53:58.119 align:start position:0%
part uh um so we're talking about uh the
 
00:54:01.190 --> 00:54:01.200 align:start position:0%
15% franchise fee on gross monthly sales
 
00:54:02.309 --> 00:54:02.319 align:start position:0%
we're going to have an interesting
 
00:54:03.870 --> 00:54:03.880 align:start position:0%
discussion down here because especially
 
00:54:05.710 --> 00:54:05.720 align:start position:0%
as we're starting the concept of whether
 
00:54:07.190 --> 00:54:07.200 align:start position:0%
or not we're going to sell medicinal
 
00:54:09.309 --> 00:54:09.319 align:start position:0%
products or therapeutic products in a
 
00:54:11.109 --> 00:54:11.119 align:start position:0%
retail store whether that's going to be
 
00:54:13.870 --> 00:54:13.880 align:start position:0%
taxed or not um or do we say yes all
 
00:54:15.549 --> 00:54:15.559 align:start position:0%
cannabis is taxed if it's in a retail
 
00:54:19.589 --> 00:54:19.599 align:start position:0%
store or only um retail recreational
 
00:54:21.990 --> 00:54:22.000 align:start position:0%
product therapeutic product is untaxed
 
00:54:23.870 --> 00:54:23.880 align:start position:0%
let's have that discussion I would just
 
00:54:26.030 --> 00:54:26.040 align:start position:0%
ask uh
 
00:54:29.430 --> 00:54:29.440 align:start position:0%
Senator that the word tax fee I
 
00:54:31.710 --> 00:54:31.720 align:start position:0%
apologize thank you appreciate it very
 
00:54:34.670 --> 00:54:34.680 align:start position:0%
much chair ways it means I always
 
00:54:37.190 --> 00:54:37.200 align:start position:0%
understood thank you
 
00:54:44.589 --> 00:54:44.599 align:start position:0%
so we spell p TX in the Hampshire tax
 
00:54:49.470 --> 00:54:49.480 align:start position:0%
Fe just um regarding the 15% uh tax uh
 
00:54:51.950 --> 00:54:51.960 align:start position:0%
Dr Lynn silver who testified two weeks
 
00:54:54.670 --> 00:54:54.680 align:start position:0%
ago from California uh in reading her
 
00:54:57.030 --> 00:54:57.040 align:start position:0%
material she said that will be
 
00:55:00.950 --> 00:55:00.960 align:start position:0%
inadequate to counter the um the social
 
00:55:04.309 --> 00:55:04.319 align:start position:0%
harms law enforcement and um that that
 
00:55:06.870 --> 00:55:06.880 align:start position:0%
we're going to be needing in so that we
 
00:55:10.549 --> 00:55:10.559 align:start position:0%
can get it right from the start so why
 
00:55:13.270 --> 00:55:13.280 align:start position:0%
what my question is is how did we arrive
 
00:55:16.630 --> 00:55:16.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:18.829 --> 00:55:18.839 align:start position:0%
why well there was there was much
 
00:55:22.349 --> 00:55:22.359 align:start position:0%
discussion in house Commerce about the
 
00:55:26.109 --> 00:55:26.119 align:start position:0%
fee whether it be 8% whether would be
 
00:55:28.829 --> 00:55:28.839 align:start position:0%
20% so the discussion went back and
 
00:55:32.109 --> 00:55:32.119 align:start position:0%
forth at length and I believe house
 
00:55:35.829 --> 00:55:35.839 align:start position:0%
Commerce at the time fell on
 
00:55:39.309 --> 00:55:39.319 align:start position:0%
12% and we uh were
 
00:55:41.950 --> 00:55:41.960 align:start position:0%
just we testified that we didn't feel
 
00:55:45.549 --> 00:55:45.559 align:start position:0%
the 12% was enough and that 15% in
 
00:55:48.710 --> 00:55:48.720 align:start position:0%
running the numbers that we've run 15%
 
00:55:53.710 --> 00:55:53.720 align:start position:0%
we feel is a fair amount for us
 
00:55:57.829 --> 00:55:57.839 align:start position:0%
to re retail the product at better
 
00:56:00.470 --> 00:56:00.480 align:start position:0%
prices than the surrounding states and
 
00:56:03.549 --> 00:56:03.559 align:start position:0%
still make it a profitable Endeavor for
 
00:56:07.630 --> 00:56:07.640 align:start position:0%
the state to undertake okay Dr Silva was
 
00:56:10.470 --> 00:56:10.480 align:start position:0%
saying that um that Revenue would be
 
00:56:12.990 --> 00:56:13.000 align:start position:0%
inadequate for the state to address the
 
00:56:16.150 --> 00:56:16.160 align:start position:0%
issues that will arise that have Arisen
 
00:56:18.390 --> 00:56:18.400 align:start position:0%
in in the legalized States and she was
 
00:56:18.400 --> 00:56:21.870 align:start position:0%
in in the legalized States and she was
recommending

00:56:21.870 --> 00:56:21.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:25.670 --> 00:56:25.680 align:start position:0%
30% well uh I think that
 
00:56:27.549 --> 00:56:27.559 align:start position:0%
the good doctor is from the state of
 
00:56:30.270 --> 00:56:30.280 align:start position:0%
California where tax doesn't seem to be
 
00:56:33.789 --> 00:56:33.799 align:start position:0%
a an issue and and is it's they're quite
 
00:56:35.670 --> 00:56:35.680 align:start position:0%
liberal with their taxes there one would
 
00:56:37.630 --> 00:56:37.640 align:start position:0%
say and I think that the state of New
 
00:56:39.309 --> 00:56:39.319 align:start position:0%
Hampshire takes a different approach to
 
00:56:43.670 --> 00:56:43.680 align:start position:0%
that we feel as business people that 15%
 
00:56:46.750 --> 00:56:46.760 align:start position:0%
is an adequate fee for the franchisees
 
00:56:49.990 --> 00:56:50.000 align:start position:0%
to pay in order for it to be profitable
 
00:56:55.029 --> 00:56:55.039 align:start position:0%
in a state this size and for us to be uh
 
00:56:57.670 --> 00:56:57.680 align:start position:0%
profitable as a business that intends to
 
00:57:01.109 --> 00:57:01.119 align:start position:0%
sell product to folks out of state much
 
00:57:03.549 --> 00:57:03.559 align:start position:0%
like the folks in this state now are now
 
00:57:05.870 --> 00:57:05.880 align:start position:0%
going to Massachusetts and paying
 
00:57:09.390 --> 00:57:09.400 align:start position:0%
exorbitant fees and taxes and in Maine
 
00:57:12.589 --> 00:57:12.599 align:start position:0%
exorbitant fees and taxes and in Vermont
 
00:57:15.950 --> 00:57:15.960 align:start position:0%
exorbitant fees and taxes so our goal is
 
00:57:18.349 --> 00:57:18.359 align:start position:0%
to be as reasonable as we possibly can
 
00:57:21.029 --> 00:57:21.039 align:start position:0%
with the prices in order to keep that
 
00:57:25.710 --> 00:57:25.720 align:start position:0%
business uh solvent Okay so follow up
 
00:57:29.710 --> 00:57:29.720 align:start position:0%
follow up uh the profitability we're
 
00:57:31.829 --> 00:57:31.839 align:start position:0%
talking two two different issues here
 
00:57:34.150 --> 00:57:34.160 align:start position:0%
profitability for the
 
00:57:37.630 --> 00:57:37.640 align:start position:0%
franchisees versus revenue for the state
 
00:57:41.029 --> 00:57:41.039 align:start position:0%
to address the uh social problems that
 
00:57:45.069 --> 00:57:45.079 align:start position:0%
will inevitably um come our way
 
00:57:48.150 --> 00:57:48.160 align:start position:0%
regardless of of the retail outlet so I
 
00:57:51.029 --> 00:57:51.039 align:start position:0%
think we need to be cognizant from the
 
00:57:53.750 --> 00:57:53.760 align:start position:0%
very beginning that we are going to have
 
00:57:57.109 --> 00:57:57.119 align:start position:0%
problems we already know that and if we
 
00:58:01.349 --> 00:58:01.359 align:start position:0%
cannot address those our state our our
 
00:58:03.870 --> 00:58:03.880 align:start position:0%
children our families our state will
 
00:58:06.029 --> 00:58:06.039 align:start position:0%
suffer we we're basically playing with
 
00:58:09.589 --> 00:58:09.599 align:start position:0%
fire here well I may Mr chairman there's
 
00:58:11.069 --> 00:58:11.079 align:start position:0%
no one at the Liquor Commission that
 
00:58:13.750 --> 00:58:13.760 align:start position:0%
wants to put anybody In Harm's Way of
 
00:58:18.630 --> 00:58:18.640 align:start position:0%
anything our our model ensures that and
 
00:58:22.150 --> 00:58:22.160 align:start position:0%
we just feel as business people that
 
00:58:26.950 --> 00:58:26.960 align:start position:0%
15% is enough for the state to have have
 
00:58:29.670 --> 00:58:29.680 align:start position:0%
a profit that ensures that everything
 
00:58:31.670 --> 00:58:31.680 align:start position:0%
that needs to be done in a state of this
 
00:58:35.950 --> 00:58:35.960 align:start position:0%
size is adequate just I just have one
 
00:58:38.270 --> 00:58:38.280 align:start position:0%
more question if I could make this point
 
00:58:43.109 --> 00:58:43.119 align:start position:0%
if our our surrounding states are have
 
00:58:47.069 --> 00:58:47.079 align:start position:0%
exorbitant um taxes on this why should
 
00:58:50.549 --> 00:58:50.559 align:start position:0%
we not play on that Level Playing Field
 
00:58:53.750 --> 00:58:53.760 align:start position:0%
why should we short Change New Hampshire
 
00:58:53.760 --> 00:58:57.630 align:start position:0%
why should we short Change New Hampshire
citizens

00:58:57.630 --> 00:58:57.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:59.990 --> 00:59:00.000 align:start position:0%
I I don't feel that we are so that's
 
00:59:00.990 --> 00:59:01.000 align:start position:0%
that's going to be ultimately end up
 
00:59:02.390 --> 00:59:02.400 align:start position:0%
being a legislative prerogative I
 
00:59:03.630 --> 00:59:03.640 align:start position:0%
promise you and it shows up in front of
 
00:59:04.710 --> 00:59:04.720 align:start position:0%
the way it means we're going to have a
 
00:59:06.309 --> 00:59:06.319 align:start position:0%
big conversation about what the rate is
 
00:59:08.430 --> 00:59:08.440 align:start position:0%
and what the revenues look like um I'm
 
00:59:11.190 --> 00:59:11.200 align:start position:0%
going to go back to 1598 from last term
 
00:59:13.630 --> 00:59:13.640 align:start position:0%
we were estimating about $250 million in
 
00:59:14.950 --> 00:59:14.960 align:start position:0%
gross sales in the state of New
 
00:59:16.950 --> 00:59:16.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire which will result on a 15%
 
00:59:19.910 --> 00:59:19.920 align:start position:0%
franchise fee of 37.5 millionar of new
 
00:59:21.470 --> 00:59:21.480 align:start position:0%
revenue for the State of New Hampshire
 
00:59:25.549 --> 00:59:25.559 align:start position:0%
to combat what's going on so I
 
00:59:27.309 --> 00:59:27.319 align:start position:0%
uh until we have some data I think $
 
00:59:30.390 --> 00:59:30.400 align:start position:0%
37.5 million in new Revenue that'll
 
00:59:32.910 --> 00:59:32.920 align:start position:0%
supplement our Mental Health Services
 
00:59:34.910 --> 00:59:34.920 align:start position:0%
and and substance abuse services are a
 
00:59:37.750 --> 00:59:37.760 align:start position:0%
significant number to help U considering
 
00:59:39.510 --> 00:59:39.520 align:start position:0%
every one of these I won't say everyone
 
00:59:41.270 --> 00:59:41.280 align:start position:0%
be enough it's
 
00:59:44.910 --> 00:59:44.920 align:start position:0%
not it gets into the argument of do we
 
00:59:46.670 --> 00:59:46.680 align:start position:0%
think they're going to be new consumers
 
00:59:47.990 --> 00:59:48.000 align:start position:0%
or is it just going to be existing
 
00:59:49.349 --> 00:59:49.359 align:start position:0%
consumers that are already doing a
 
00:59:50.710 --> 00:59:50.720 align:start position:0%
product and already have the issues to
 
00:59:52.150 --> 00:59:52.160 align:start position:0%
begin with that we're going to be
 
00:59:54.309 --> 00:59:54.319 align:start position:0%
working with so I think there's probably
 
00:59:56.069 --> 00:59:56.079 align:start position:0%
an an inal growth that happens but the
 
00:59:57.349 --> 00:59:57.359 align:start position:0%
question is what that looks like and
 
00:59:58.390 --> 00:59:58.400 align:start position:0%
it's not going to be solved in this
 
01:00:02.230 --> 01:00:02.240 align:start position:0%
committee I promise you um so um let's
 
01:00:04.430 --> 01:00:04.440 align:start position:0%
come over here Tim the J the Jordan and
 
01:00:05.309 --> 01:00:05.319 align:start position:0%
then the
 
01:00:07.990 --> 01:00:08.000 align:start position:0%
chief and then
 
01:00:12.069 --> 01:00:12.079 align:start position:0%
Dave thank you represent um yes in ways
 
01:00:15.349 --> 01:00:15.359 align:start position:0%
and means this will get a proctological
 
01:00:19.750 --> 01:00:19.760 align:start position:0%
exam actually um one of the things that
 
01:00:22.430 --> 01:00:22.440 align:start position:0%
we will consider in this in Ways and
 
01:00:25.470 --> 01:00:25.480 align:start position:0%
Means will be the effect on on the black
 
01:00:28.029 --> 01:00:28.039 align:start position:0%
market which has not been discussed in
 
01:00:31.670 --> 01:00:31.680 align:start position:0%
here uh states with a high taxation I
 
01:00:33.870 --> 01:00:33.880 align:start position:0%
know from going to various national
 
01:00:36.670 --> 01:00:36.680 align:start position:0%
conferences states that have had that
 
01:00:39.349 --> 01:00:39.359 align:start position:0%
have wound up not competing with the
 
01:00:41.309 --> 01:00:41.319 align:start position:0%
black market in the black market the
 
01:00:43.430 --> 01:00:43.440 align:start position:0%
corner salesman with selling whatever
 
01:00:46.829 --> 01:00:46.839 align:start position:0%
weed he can grow uh winds
 
01:00:51.990 --> 01:00:52.000 align:start position:0%
up uh under selling the uh the state at
 
01:00:54.190 --> 01:00:54.200 align:start position:0%
that time which means that you're not
 
01:00:56.990 --> 01:00:57.000 align:start position:0%
affective ing illegal sales you're not
 
01:00:59.270 --> 01:00:59.280 align:start position:0%
stopping the black market you're not
 
01:01:01.990 --> 01:01:02.000 align:start position:0%
stopping tainted product from getting
 
01:01:04.549 --> 01:01:04.559 align:start position:0%
out but if you can provide a product
 
01:01:06.990 --> 01:01:07.000 align:start position:0%
that is less expensive and that is
 
01:01:09.109 --> 01:01:09.119 align:start position:0%
tested in the same fashion that we do
 
01:01:11.750 --> 01:01:11.760 align:start position:0%
with both cigarettes and with alcohol
 
01:01:14.069 --> 01:01:14.079 align:start position:0%
today under the program that we have
 
01:01:17.190 --> 01:01:17.200 align:start position:0%
then you don't have bathtub Jin being
 
01:01:19.630 --> 01:01:19.640 align:start position:0%
sold you've
 
01:01:22.029 --> 01:01:22.039 align:start position:0%
got um
 
01:01:24.950 --> 01:01:24.960 align:start position:0%
beers which isn't bad but
 
01:01:27.870 --> 01:01:27.880 align:start position:0%
kind of bitter but um that's that's
 
01:01:29.510 --> 01:01:29.520 align:start position:0%
that's my point and that will be
 
01:01:32.589 --> 01:01:32.599 align:start position:0%
discussed in ways means okay did didn't
 
01:01:34.069 --> 01:01:34.079 align:start position:0%
we have some discussion about removing
 
01:01:36.589 --> 01:01:36.599 align:start position:0%
this 1% uh with the municipalities
 
01:01:37.789 --> 01:01:37.799 align:start position:0%
because we didn't want to put them at
 
01:01:39.750 --> 01:01:39.760 align:start position:0%
risk of uh if something happens
 
01:01:42.470 --> 01:01:42.480 align:start position:0%
federally and they crack down on money
 
01:01:46.150 --> 01:01:46.160 align:start position:0%
then again so the so right now under the
 
01:01:49.349 --> 01:01:49.359 align:start position:0%
under this bill um although I think the
 
01:01:51.750 --> 01:01:51.760 align:start position:0%
we might be talking wrong Chief I I I
 
01:01:55.230 --> 01:01:55.240 align:start position:0%
think the intent was um not not 1% of
 
01:01:58.789 --> 01:01:58.799 align:start position:0%
the 15% but a full 1% of the rate of the
 
01:02:01.190 --> 01:02:01.200 align:start position:0%
fee would go to the retailer because the
 
01:02:03.390 --> 01:02:03.400 align:start position:0%
way this is written it' be 1% of 15%
 
01:02:05.870 --> 01:02:05.880 align:start position:0%
which is a really really small number um
 
01:02:07.670 --> 01:02:07.680 align:start position:0%
and so I think we just need to need to
 
01:02:09.430 --> 01:02:09.440 align:start position:0%
correct that the idea is the state would
 
01:02:12.309 --> 01:02:12.319 align:start position:0%
keep 14% the town would get 1% the
 
01:02:14.069 --> 01:02:14.079 align:start position:0%
state's collecting all 15 though and
 
01:02:15.910 --> 01:02:15.920 align:start position:0%
then disturbing it back to the town and
 
01:02:18.150 --> 01:02:18.160 align:start position:0%
I'm assuming when you say Town cheap
 
01:02:19.710 --> 01:02:19.720 align:start position:0%
you're talking about the community that
 
01:02:24.109 --> 01:02:24.119 align:start position:0%
hosts the retail store are we talking um
 
01:02:25.990 --> 01:02:26.000 align:start position:0%
like rooms of meals tax where it just
 
01:02:27.150 --> 01:02:27.160 align:start position:0%
goes into a pool of money it's
 
01:02:29.309 --> 01:02:29.319 align:start position:0%
distributed to all towns and all cities
 
01:02:31.390 --> 01:02:31.400 align:start position:0%
which way is this goes to the individual
 
01:02:33.549 --> 01:02:33.559 align:start position:0%
towns that have the
 
01:02:37.870 --> 01:02:37.880 align:start position:0%
stores um da Chief and then
 
01:02:40.990 --> 01:02:41.000 align:start position:0%
Dave thank you Mr chair um again not
 
01:02:44.190 --> 01:02:44.200 align:start position:0%
with respect to whether or not I'm
 
01:02:46.789 --> 01:02:46.799 align:start position:0%
weighing in on the 15% that's either
 
01:02:50.269 --> 01:02:50.279 align:start position:0%
high or low but in the connection with
 
01:02:52.710 --> 01:02:52.720 align:start position:0%
what um you mentioned which is the
 
01:02:55.549 --> 01:02:55.559 align:start position:0%
research and just for the edification
 
01:02:58.589 --> 01:02:58.599 align:start position:0%
of uh the committee there is a report
 
01:03:00.950 --> 01:03:00.960 align:start position:0%
out that was issued uh fairly recently
 
01:03:04.190 --> 01:03:04.200 align:start position:0%
September of 2023 by a rather esteemed
 
01:03:07.029 --> 01:03:07.039 align:start position:0%
institution that really has no dog in
 
01:03:08.950 --> 01:03:08.960 align:start position:0%
the fight if you will and that's the
 
01:03:12.549 --> 01:03:12.559 align:start position:0%
Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas uh that
 
01:03:15.870 --> 01:03:15.880 align:start position:0%
report is is online and it talks about
 
01:03:19.029 --> 01:03:19.039 align:start position:0%
um the offset cost which is I think part
 
01:03:20.789 --> 01:03:20.799 align:start position:0%
of the discussion with respect to your
 
01:03:24.069 --> 01:03:24.079 align:start position:0%
percentage debate and that offset cost
 
01:03:26.309 --> 01:03:26.319 align:start position:0%
that the Federal Reserve Bank
 
01:03:28.470 --> 01:03:28.480 align:start position:0%
estimates uh is
 
01:03:31.750 --> 01:03:31.760 align:start position:0%
$1,400 per capita which is a rather
 
01:03:34.589 --> 01:03:34.599 align:start position:0%
large amount so uh perhaps that study
 
01:03:37.670 --> 01:03:37.680 align:start position:0%
could be used by Ways and Means and um
 
01:03:39.870 --> 01:03:39.880 align:start position:0%
uh take a look at what the potential
 
01:03:43.269 --> 01:03:43.279 align:start position:0%
offset costs are uh and that that report
 
01:03:47.029 --> 01:03:47.039 align:start position:0%
is available online great any discussion
 
01:03:50.670 --> 01:03:50.680 align:start position:0%
about the uh question Senor Ganon
 
01:03:53.829 --> 01:03:53.839 align:start position:0%
commissioner you said earlier you said
 
01:03:55.269 --> 01:03:55.279 align:start position:0%
turn your mic I'm
 
01:03:58.029 --> 01:03:58.039 align:start position:0%
sorry um commissioner you said you
 
01:04:00.309 --> 01:04:00.319 align:start position:0%
didn't want to put anyone in harm as way
 
01:04:02.549 --> 01:04:02.559 align:start position:0%
but if you're increasing sales and the
 
01:04:06.390 --> 01:04:06.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:09.349 --> 01:04:09.359 align:start position:0%
products got it that time um you said
 
01:04:23.190 --> 01:04:23.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:23.200 --> 01:04:24.990 align:start position:0%
 
swing

01:04:24.990 --> 01:04:25.000 align:start position:0%
swing
 
01:04:26.630 --> 01:04:26.640 align:start position:0%
I think when I was referring to that I
 
01:04:28.789 --> 01:04:28.799 align:start position:0%
was referring to the the liquor sales
 
01:04:30.670 --> 01:04:30.680 align:start position:0%
the way we do it the way we're doing
 
01:04:33.910 --> 01:04:33.920 align:start position:0%
sales now are our model is around
 
01:04:37.430 --> 01:04:37.440 align:start position:0%
education those stores are controlled
 
01:04:40.190 --> 01:04:40.200 align:start position:0%
locations and thus being a controlled
 
01:04:42.990 --> 01:04:43.000 align:start position:0%
State and we feel that the oversight of
 
01:04:45.990 --> 01:04:46.000 align:start position:0%
the franchisees would also indicate that
 
01:04:48.589 --> 01:04:48.599 align:start position:0%
they'd be a controlled location that's
 
01:04:52.750 --> 01:04:52.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:55.990 --> 01:04:56.000 align:start position:0%
senator in regards adds to whatever
 
01:04:59.269 --> 01:04:59.279 align:start position:0%
amount percentage uh the franchise fee
 
01:05:02.349 --> 01:05:02.359 align:start position:0%
is I mean we could have a franchise fee
 
01:05:06.230 --> 01:05:06.240 align:start position:0%
of 30% to 50% but if it's not going to
 
01:05:08.269 --> 01:05:08.279 align:start position:0%
the right places to offset the H that's
 
01:05:10.750 --> 01:05:10.760 align:start position:0%
being done my my recommendation would be
 
01:05:12.990 --> 01:05:13.000 align:start position:0%
that to make sure that whatever fee
 
01:05:15.470 --> 01:05:15.480 align:start position:0%
comes in that we have a high enough
 
01:05:18.710 --> 01:05:18.720 align:start position:0%
percentage of it going to mental health
 
01:05:20.230 --> 01:05:20.240 align:start position:0%
going into the mental health aspect
 
01:05:23.069 --> 01:05:23.079 align:start position:0%
going into the no I I know but I'm just
 
01:05:24.630 --> 01:05:24.640 align:start position:0%
saying in relation to this
 
01:05:28.789 --> 01:05:28.799 align:start position:0%
I I think that's that's the uh Baseline
 
01:05:30.670 --> 01:05:30.680 align:start position:0%
that we should be looking at no matter
 
01:05:33.430 --> 01:05:33.440 align:start position:0%
what the fee is that an adequate amount
 
01:05:36.510 --> 01:05:36.520 align:start position:0%
is going towards offset
 
01:05:39.990 --> 01:05:40.000 align:start position:0%
so so again I'll just say as a serving
 
01:05:41.309 --> 01:05:41.319 align:start position:0%
three terms in the house and ways of
 
01:05:43.710 --> 01:05:43.720 align:start position:0%
means and chair ways of means in our in
 
01:05:45.950 --> 01:05:45.960 align:start position:0%
our state in the Senate now that the
 
01:05:47.470 --> 01:05:47.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's never been one just to raise
 
01:05:50.029 --> 01:05:50.039 align:start position:0%
a tax to collect Revenue right there had
 
01:05:52.430 --> 01:05:52.440 align:start position:0%
the the point of our the tax model is a
 
01:05:55.190 --> 01:05:55.200 align:start position:0%
to have money to offset any any cost so
 
01:05:57.269 --> 01:05:57.279 align:start position:0%
the cost of liquor will come out of that
 
01:05:59.549 --> 01:05:59.559 align:start position:0%
as well um so that there's no to the
 
01:06:01.870 --> 01:06:01.880 align:start position:0%
general citizenry there's none expense
 
01:06:03.789 --> 01:06:03.799 align:start position:0%
for this and then the second part is
 
01:06:06.190 --> 01:06:06.200 align:start position:0%
provide the services that are necessary
 
01:06:07.950 --> 01:06:07.960 align:start position:0%
but even after we got all that it's not
 
01:06:10.710 --> 01:06:10.720 align:start position:0%
in the Hampshire's way to just ratchet
 
01:06:12.789 --> 01:06:12.799 align:start position:0%
the tax up for this cause right for the
 
01:06:14.910 --> 01:06:14.920 align:start position:0%
sake of just generating revenue for the
 
01:06:17.829 --> 01:06:17.839 align:start position:0%
general fund so uh I I will say I think
 
01:06:20.109 --> 01:06:20.119 align:start position:0%
a portion you have to recognize is I
 
01:06:21.910 --> 01:06:21.920 align:start position:0%
think what the chief was alluding to is
 
01:06:25.109 --> 01:06:25.119 align:start position:0%
again there's a certain amount of of I'm
 
01:06:28.190 --> 01:06:28.200 align:start position:0%
going to call it harm reduction um in in
 
01:06:30.549 --> 01:06:30.559 align:start position:0%
consumers of product if they don't have
 
01:06:31.950 --> 01:06:31.960 align:start position:0%
to go to the black market because we
 
01:06:33.630 --> 01:06:33.640 align:start position:0%
have a clean product for lack of a
 
01:06:35.150 --> 01:06:35.160 align:start position:0%
better phrase that they're consuming we
 
01:06:36.470 --> 01:06:36.480 align:start position:0%
don't have to worry about kids
 
01:06:38.630 --> 01:06:38.640 align:start position:0%
overdosing on fentanyl we don't have to
 
01:06:41.269 --> 01:06:41.279 align:start position:0%
or or adults overdosing on fentanyl um
 
01:06:44.390 --> 01:06:44.400 align:start position:0%
because they're getting a clean tested
 
01:06:45.910 --> 01:06:45.920 align:start position:0%
Pro product and I think there's a
 
01:06:47.430 --> 01:06:47.440 align:start position:0%
certain amount of that and making sure
 
01:06:50.109 --> 01:06:50.119 align:start position:0%
that the tax and so exorbitant that it
 
01:06:51.789 --> 01:06:51.799 align:start position:0%
pushes them back to Black Market where
 
01:06:54.309 --> 01:06:54.319 align:start position:0%
that potential then exists again um um
 
01:06:56.589 --> 01:06:56.599 align:start position:0%
where um those those adulterated
 
01:06:58.910 --> 01:06:58.920 align:start position:0%
products can be served because it's
 
01:07:00.390 --> 01:07:00.400 align:start position:0%
cheaper to go to the black market than
 
01:07:02.109 --> 01:07:02.119 align:start position:0%
it is to come to the state so it's a
 
01:07:05.150 --> 01:07:05.160 align:start position:0%
balancing act but for sure um and and I
 
01:07:07.309 --> 01:07:07.319 align:start position:0%
I don't know whether 15% is the right
 
01:07:08.630 --> 01:07:08.640 align:start position:0%
number we'll find we'll have this
 
01:07:09.990 --> 01:07:10.000 align:start position:0%
discussion in ways and means we we
 
01:07:13.870 --> 01:07:13.880 align:start position:0%
talking about um the fee um but um but
 
01:07:15.029 --> 01:07:15.039 align:start position:0%
just understand there's a little bit of
 
01:07:16.990 --> 01:07:17.000 align:start position:0%
a balance act going on there about
 
01:07:19.430 --> 01:07:19.440 align:start position:0%
reduction of harm by having consumers
 
01:07:21.349 --> 01:07:21.359 align:start position:0%
move off the black market and come into
 
01:07:23.430 --> 01:07:23.440 align:start position:0%
the legal market and we had the same
 
01:07:25.910 --> 01:07:25.920 align:start position:0%
discussion around sports betting when I
 
01:07:28.630 --> 01:07:28.640 align:start position:0%
put that bill in um about how much we
 
01:07:30.789 --> 01:07:30.799 align:start position:0%
took away from Black Market and it was
 
01:07:33.510 --> 01:07:33.520 align:start position:0%
helpful to the industry so or to
 
01:07:35.670 --> 01:07:35.680 align:start position:0%
Consumers because they couldn't Mr chair
 
01:07:38.029 --> 01:07:38.039 align:start position:0%
I just want to just make one final point
 
01:07:39.990 --> 01:07:40.000 align:start position:0%
it all comes down to what's in the
 
01:07:41.470 --> 01:07:41.480 align:start position:0%
bucket if there's not enough in the
 
01:07:43.710 --> 01:07:43.720 align:start position:0%
bucket you are not going to be be able
 
01:07:48.029 --> 01:07:48.039 align:start position:0%
to direct the correct amount to offset
 
01:07:49.670 --> 01:07:49.680 align:start position:0%
the risks in the hubs that's that's all
 
01:07:52.150 --> 01:07:52.160 align:start position:0%
I'm saying all right so we're done on
 
01:07:56.309 --> 01:07:56.319 align:start position:0%
that one moving on uh 318 F10 um so the
 
01:07:57.910 --> 01:07:57.920 align:start position:0%
only change I had in that last section
 
01:07:59.069 --> 01:07:59.079 align:start position:0%
by the way was I'm going to clean up
 
01:08:01.309 --> 01:08:01.319 align:start position:0%
that language around the 1% of 15% to
 
01:08:03.470 --> 01:08:03.480 align:start position:0%
make sure it's clear that they get a
 
01:08:06.750 --> 01:08:06.760 align:start position:0%
full 1% of the tax that's collected and
 
01:08:09.029 --> 01:08:09.039 align:start position:0%
the removal of the word opaque and a
 
01:08:10.789 --> 01:08:10.799 align:start position:0%
removal of the word opaque on that was
 
01:08:14.829 --> 01:08:14.839 align:start position:0%
in the previous section yeah okay um and
 
01:08:16.510 --> 01:08:16.520 align:start position:0%
it's a fee not a
 
01:08:19.470 --> 01:08:19.480 align:start position:0%
tax corre it says
 
01:08:21.789 --> 01:08:21.799 align:start position:0%
tax little side note Mr J you were
 
01:08:23.590 --> 01:08:23.600 align:start position:0%
saying that we don't tax products to
 
01:08:26.470 --> 01:08:26.480 align:start position:0%
make money so much I know you're saying
 
01:08:28.829 --> 01:08:28.839 align:start position:0%
$6 to800 million from banking off of
 
01:08:31.149 --> 01:08:31.159 align:start position:0%
alcohol isn't to make Revenue well no
 
01:08:32.390 --> 01:08:32.400 align:start position:0%
I'm not saying it's it's absolute but we
 
01:08:33.630 --> 01:08:33.640 align:start position:0%
just don't do it for the sake of doing
 
01:08:36.749 --> 01:08:36.759 align:start position:0%
it is what I'm saying
 
01:08:39.789 --> 01:08:39.799 align:start position:0%
um all right moving on uh residency
 
01:08:41.950 --> 01:08:41.960 align:start position:0%
requirement um accept as provid in the
 
01:08:43.470 --> 01:08:43.480 align:start position:0%
section any person applying for a
 
01:08:45.309 --> 01:08:45.319 align:start position:0%
cannabis establishment license shall be
 
01:08:47.110 --> 01:08:47.120 align:start position:0%
a resident or shall have at least one
 
01:08:48.910 --> 01:08:48.920 align:start position:0%
director offic or partner who was in a
 
01:08:51.749 --> 01:08:51.759 align:start position:0%
Hampshire resident yeah Mr chair just
 
01:08:54.669 --> 01:08:54.679 align:start position:0%
one recommendation here uh establishes
 
01:08:57.189 --> 01:08:57.199 align:start position:0%
and maintains this would prohibit
 
01:09:00.030 --> 01:09:00.040 align:start position:0%
someone from establishing a residence
 
01:09:01.510 --> 01:09:01.520 align:start position:0%
just for the purposes of getting a
 
01:09:04.470 --> 01:09:04.480 align:start position:0%
license and then not maintaining
 
01:09:06.550 --> 01:09:06.560 align:start position:0%
residency I think the intent here is to
 
01:09:09.229 --> 01:09:09.239 align:start position:0%
ensure that the individual establishes
 
01:09:11.229 --> 01:09:11.239 align:start position:0%
and maintains residents in the state of
 
01:09:11.239 --> 01:09:16.829 align:start position:0%
and maintains residents in the state of
New

01:09:16.829 --> 01:09:16.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:19.110 --> 01:09:19.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so I I'm not sure your
 
01:09:20.749 --> 01:09:20.759 align:start position:0%
question because the way this is written
 
01:09:22.189 --> 01:09:22.199 align:start position:0%
that's what it says you have to be an
 
01:09:24.910 --> 01:09:24.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire resident to request a license
 
01:09:27.590 --> 01:09:27.600 align:start position:0%
or one officer must be a resident well
 
01:09:29.550 --> 01:09:29.560 align:start position:0%
it says it says establishment doesn't
 
01:09:32.669 --> 01:09:32.679 align:start position:0%
say maintain so you establishment is the
 
01:09:35.630 --> 01:09:35.640 align:start position:0%
is the facility establish established
 
01:09:37.789 --> 01:09:37.799 align:start position:0%
residency it says a cannabis
 
01:09:41.550 --> 01:09:41.560 align:start position:0%
establishment license a person applying
 
01:09:43.749 --> 01:09:43.759 align:start position:0%
for an establishment license so we're
 
01:09:45.709 --> 01:09:45.719 align:start position:0%
talking about the person sell sell
 
01:09:47.269 --> 01:09:47.279 align:start position:0%
establish a residence but doesn't say
 
01:09:48.950 --> 01:09:48.960 align:start position:0%
that they should that they're required
 
01:09:51.709 --> 01:09:51.719 align:start position:0%
to maintain a residence that's what I'm
 
01:09:53.950 --> 01:09:53.960 align:start position:0%
recommending to establish a residence
 
01:09:59.550 --> 01:09:59.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:02.910 --> 01:10:02.920 align:start position:0%
okay number two anybody have so we all
 
01:10:05.590 --> 01:10:05.600 align:start position:0%
set with Section 10 on residency
 
01:10:05.600 --> 01:10:07.630 align:start position:0%
set with Section 10 on residency
requirement

01:10:07.630 --> 01:10:07.640 align:start position:0%
requirement
 
01:10:07.640 --> 01:10:09.229 align:start position:0%
requirement
okay

01:10:09.229 --> 01:10:09.239 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:10:12.270 --> 01:10:12.280 align:start position:0%
um 318
 
01:10:16.189 --> 01:10:16.199 align:start position:0%
F1 alcohol infused cannabis products
 
01:10:21.750 --> 01:10:21.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:23.830 --> 01:10:23.840 align:start position:0%
compensation I think this section was
 
01:10:27.430 --> 01:10:27.440 align:start position:0%
just put into place so we we didn't have
 
01:10:30.350 --> 01:10:30.360 align:start position:0%
uh there is there is many products out
 
01:10:33.110 --> 01:10:33.120 align:start position:0%
in the market now that are uh cannabis
 
01:10:35.790 --> 01:10:35.800 align:start position:0%
infused drinks and we wanted to make
 
01:10:38.070 --> 01:10:38.080 align:start position:0%
sure that those weren't allowed to be
 
01:10:40.390 --> 01:10:40.400 align:start position:0%
sold in the state that was the goal
 
01:10:42.630 --> 01:10:42.640 align:start position:0%
behind it there's cannabis vodkas
 
01:10:42.640 --> 01:10:43.510 align:start position:0%
behind it there's cannabis vodkas
there's

01:10:43.510 --> 01:10:43.520 align:start position:0%
there's
 
01:10:46.990 --> 01:10:47.000 align:start position:0%
cannabis uh
 
01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:48.550 align:start position:0%
cannabis uh
cocktails

01:10:48.550 --> 01:10:48.560 align:start position:0%
cocktails
 
01:10:51.950 --> 01:10:51.960 align:start position:0%
beers so so I will say this and and this
 
01:10:53.669 --> 01:10:53.679 align:start position:0%
is going to be an important section in
 
01:10:58.310 --> 01:10:58.320 align:start position:0%
the future so in October I was invited
 
01:11:00.590 --> 01:11:00.600 align:start position:0%
by the beer distributors to to sit on a
 
01:11:03.870 --> 01:11:03.880 align:start position:0%
panel out in Las Vegas to discuss THC
 
01:11:07.310 --> 01:11:07.320 align:start position:0%
infused beverages um and what regulatory
 
01:11:08.430 --> 01:11:08.440 align:start position:0%
requirements we had someone from
 
01:11:11.189 --> 01:11:11.199 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts Wisconsin that that did
 
01:11:13.630 --> 01:11:13.640 align:start position:0%
this and I was on a panel to discuss it
 
01:11:16.830 --> 01:11:16.840 align:start position:0%
um to to the Distributors um
 
01:11:19.709 --> 01:11:19.719 align:start position:0%
and I in one of the benefits of that was
 
01:11:21.990 --> 01:11:22.000 align:start position:0%
I got to go on the trade floor to see
 
01:11:23.750 --> 01:11:23.760 align:start position:0%
all the new products that are coming out
 
01:11:26.669 --> 01:11:26.679 align:start position:0%
one in four um products that were
 
01:11:30.070 --> 01:11:30.080 align:start position:0%
beverages um in that was a THC infused
 
01:11:33.110 --> 01:11:33.120 align:start position:0%
drink whether it was alcohol or whether
 
01:11:35.709 --> 01:11:35.719 align:start position:0%
it was non-alcohol related um basically
 
01:11:37.990 --> 01:11:38.000 align:start position:0%
think th you know cannabis infus THC
 
01:11:40.189 --> 01:11:40.199 align:start position:0%
infused Red Bull you know kind type of
 
01:11:41.950 --> 01:11:41.960 align:start position:0%
products that were one in four of the
 
01:11:45.830 --> 01:11:45.840 align:start position:0%
products were THC infused beverages so
 
01:11:48.390 --> 01:11:48.400 align:start position:0%
as we talk about this I'm with this is
 
01:11:49.990 --> 01:11:50.000 align:start position:0%
specifically talking about alcohol but
 
01:11:51.790 --> 01:11:51.800 align:start position:0%
how do we I I don't I don't remember
 
01:11:53.229 --> 01:11:53.239 align:start position:0%
reading anywhere how are we going to
 
01:11:54.830 --> 01:11:54.840 align:start position:0%
deal with other products that are th
 
01:11:54.840 --> 01:11:56.550 align:start position:0%
deal with other products that are th
infused

01:11:56.550 --> 01:11:56.560 align:start position:0%
infused
 
01:11:58.430 --> 01:11:58.440 align:start position:0%
beverages we're just going to treat them
 
01:12:00.510 --> 01:12:00.520 align:start position:0%
as regular edible products and leave it
 
01:12:02.709 --> 01:12:02.719 align:start position:0%
at that or this is specifically about
 
01:12:04.510 --> 01:12:04.520 align:start position:0%
alcohol but these there were a
 
01:12:06.350 --> 01:12:06.360 align:start position:0%
significant portion of the products that
 
01:12:08.310 --> 01:12:08.320 align:start position:0%
were on they were not alcoholic drinks
 
01:12:11.350 --> 01:12:11.360 align:start position:0%
they were just THC fused
 
01:12:14.270 --> 01:12:14.280 align:start position:0%
beverages jar uh yeah and I'm I'm kind
 
01:12:15.990 --> 01:12:16.000 align:start position:0%
of curious too
 
01:12:18.830 --> 01:12:18.840 align:start position:0%
because this seems like this could the
 
01:12:20.350 --> 01:12:20.360 align:start position:0%
way it's written now could lead to a
 
01:12:22.990 --> 01:12:23.000 align:start position:0%
problem where things are legal
 
01:12:24.110 --> 01:12:24.120 align:start position:0%
everywhere else in the country or
 
01:12:25.149 --> 01:12:25.159 align:start position:0%
everywhere where it's currently
 
01:12:26.709 --> 01:12:26.719 align:start position:0%
legalized but then it's illegal in New
 
01:12:28.110 --> 01:12:28.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire because I I'm assuming the
 
01:12:29.629 --> 01:12:29.639 align:start position:0%
Liquor Commission isn't going to sell
 
01:12:31.270 --> 01:12:31.280 align:start position:0%
these products because it's it's sort of
 
01:12:33.430 --> 01:12:33.440 align:start position:0%
like across of the
 
01:12:35.550 --> 01:12:35.560 align:start position:0%
two The Liquor Commission also doesn't
 
01:12:38.669 --> 01:12:38.679 align:start position:0%
want these franchise stores selling
 
01:12:41.430 --> 01:12:41.440 align:start position:0%
alcohol right so I it seems to me like
 
01:12:44.629 --> 01:12:44.639 align:start position:0%
this is this is going to create uh
 
01:12:45.709 --> 01:12:45.719 align:start position:0%
people are going to be buying these in
 
01:12:47.910 --> 01:12:47.920 align:start position:0%
Maine or New Hampshire Vermont I mean
 
01:12:49.629 --> 01:12:49.639 align:start position:0%
massachus Vermont whatever coming across
 
01:12:51.590 --> 01:12:51.600 align:start position:0%
the border like it just seems like we
 
01:12:52.350 --> 01:12:52.360 align:start position:0%
this is something we should probably
 
01:12:54.149 --> 01:12:54.159 align:start position:0%
flesh out how are we going to handle it
 
01:12:56.390 --> 01:12:56.400 align:start position:0%
in terms of you get caught with it is it
 
01:12:57.790 --> 01:12:57.800 align:start position:0%
going to be illegal so if you got caught
 
01:13:00.110 --> 01:13:00.120 align:start position:0%
with a I don't know a beer infused with
 
01:13:01.709 --> 01:13:01.719 align:start position:0%
cannabis are you going to get arrested
 
01:13:03.110 --> 01:13:03.120 align:start position:0%
in the state of New Hampshire like how
 
01:13:05.350 --> 01:13:05.360 align:start position:0%
is that going to be all
 
01:13:08.350 --> 01:13:08.360 align:start position:0%
handled well I think you know what this
 
01:13:10.470 --> 01:13:10.480 align:start position:0%
was done how this was written was kind
 
01:13:13.510 --> 01:13:13.520 align:start position:0%
of a general outline much like uh we
 
01:13:16.270 --> 01:13:16.280 align:start position:0%
don't sell beer in the liquor stores so
 
01:13:19.950 --> 01:13:19.960 align:start position:0%
if if we wanted to allow the franchisees
 
01:13:23.870 --> 01:13:23.880 align:start position:0%
to sell cannabis infused drinks or
 
01:13:27.310 --> 01:13:27.320 align:start position:0%
perhaps cannabis infused beer not
 
01:13:30.990 --> 01:13:31.000 align:start position:0%
alcohol beer malt beverage or drinks
 
01:13:32.590 --> 01:13:32.600 align:start position:0%
that's something that we certainly could
 
01:13:34.910 --> 01:13:34.920 align:start position:0%
add to their license and something that
 
01:13:37.270 --> 01:13:37.280 align:start position:0%
they could sell if that's the wish of
 
01:13:39.950 --> 01:13:39.960 align:start position:0%
the legislature to do that alcohol would
 
01:13:43.510 --> 01:13:43.520 align:start position:0%
be another cannabis infused vodka for
 
01:13:45.629 --> 01:13:45.639 align:start position:0%
instance would be something different
 
01:13:47.070 --> 01:13:47.080 align:start position:0%
that the Liquor Commission would have to
 
01:13:49.950 --> 01:13:49.960 align:start position:0%
look at being that we're the sole uh
 
01:13:51.790 --> 01:13:51.800 align:start position:0%
retailer of
 
01:13:55.430 --> 01:13:55.440 align:start position:0%
alcohol so we certainly don't want them
 
01:13:58.229 --> 01:13:58.239 align:start position:0%
selling a cannabis infused alcohol when
 
01:13:59.870 --> 01:13:59.880 align:start position:0%
we don't allow anyone else to sell
 
01:14:03.430 --> 01:14:03.440 align:start position:0%
alcohol malt beverage is different and
 
01:14:07.030 --> 01:14:07.040 align:start position:0%
and I I can further Define that malt
 
01:14:11.149 --> 01:14:11.159 align:start position:0%
beverage and or Spirits beverage under
 
01:14:16.229 --> 01:14:16.239 align:start position:0%
the 6% most of these are Under the 6% so
 
01:14:19.350 --> 01:14:19.360 align:start position:0%
they would fall under the purview of a
 
01:14:22.870 --> 01:14:22.880 align:start position:0%
beer distributor Distributing them to
 
01:14:23.790 --> 01:14:23.800 align:start position:0%
the fr
 
01:14:26.350 --> 01:14:26.360 align:start position:0%
franchisee and the Liquor Commission
 
01:14:29.510 --> 01:14:29.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:31.750 --> 01:14:31.760 align:start position:0%
that I just wanted to point out that
 
01:14:34.910 --> 01:14:34.920 align:start position:0%
there are dry counties still in the
 
01:14:37.229 --> 01:14:37.239 align:start position:0%
United States of America so just because
 
01:14:38.430 --> 01:14:38.440 align:start position:0%
alcohol is
 
01:14:41.270 --> 01:14:41.280 align:start position:0%
sold everywhere there are still places
 
01:14:43.390 --> 01:14:43.400 align:start position:0%
where it's not sold you
 
01:14:46.070 --> 01:14:46.080 align:start position:0%
know and some very good alcohol comes
 
01:14:49.030 --> 01:14:49.040 align:start position:0%
from a very dry county in
 
01:14:54.709 --> 01:14:54.719 align:start position:0%
Tennessee um so again I I
 
01:14:57.870 --> 01:14:57.880 align:start position:0%
guess I agree with the other issue is
 
01:15:01.510 --> 01:15:01.520 align:start position:0%
around um their federal license right so
 
01:15:02.910 --> 01:15:02.920 align:start position:0%
is there an issue around the federal
 
01:15:05.470 --> 01:15:05.480 align:start position:0%
alcohol license ttb or something like
 
01:15:07.470 --> 01:15:07.480 align:start position:0%
that that they have to get they're not
 
01:15:09.750 --> 01:15:09.760 align:start position:0%
allowing cannabis to be infused if you
 
01:15:12.830 --> 01:15:12.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:14.669 --> 01:15:14.679 align:start position:0%
licenses and I don't know if it applies
 
01:15:17.430 --> 01:15:17.440 align:start position:0%
to beer or not I'm not sure it's
 
01:15:19.430 --> 01:15:19.440 align:start position:0%
something we could look into but I I'm
 
01:15:22.189 --> 01:15:22.199 align:start position:0%
just to your point of going to the to
 
01:15:25.229 --> 01:15:25.239 align:start position:0%
the event in Las V Vegas this is a huge
 
01:15:27.830 --> 01:15:27.840 align:start position:0%
Emerging Market we certainly wouldn't
 
01:15:31.550 --> 01:15:31.560 align:start position:0%
want the state to if if if it's the goal
 
01:15:33.870 --> 01:15:33.880 align:start position:0%
of the legislature to make sure that
 
01:15:35.870 --> 01:15:35.880 align:start position:0%
we're competitive with other states we
 
01:15:38.229 --> 01:15:38.239 align:start position:0%
certainly wouldn't want these products
 
01:15:40.830 --> 01:15:40.840 align:start position:0%
not to be available in the state if that
 
01:15:43.750 --> 01:15:43.760 align:start position:0%
was the goal and if they were available
 
01:15:45.910 --> 01:15:45.920 align:start position:0%
in the state then they should fall under
 
01:15:49.149 --> 01:15:49.159 align:start position:0%
the umbrella of the controlled Market of
 
01:15:50.830 --> 01:15:50.840 align:start position:0%
the light of the
 
01:15:55.430 --> 01:15:55.440 align:start position:0%
franchisee not in uh every corner store
 
01:16:00.830 --> 01:16:00.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:03.510 --> 01:16:03.520 align:start position:0%
concern a couple a couple comments I I
 
01:16:06.070 --> 01:16:06.080 align:start position:0%
think that um responding to
 
01:16:08.790 --> 01:16:08.800 align:start position:0%
representative svin I I think that the
 
01:16:11.470 --> 01:16:11.480 align:start position:0%
you know as it stands this is it's it's
 
01:16:14.629 --> 01:16:14.639 align:start position:0%
not for possession of or consumption of
 
01:16:16.669 --> 01:16:16.679 align:start position:0%
um it's for us to like manufacture uh
 
01:16:19.270 --> 01:16:19.280 align:start position:0%
you know import or sell um so if you
 
01:16:21.229 --> 01:16:21.239 align:start position:0%
were to buy this in Massachusetts and
 
01:16:22.550 --> 01:16:22.560 align:start position:0%
bring it home to New Hampshire that
 
01:16:24.550 --> 01:16:24.560 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be a problem from I I wouldn't
 
01:16:27.189 --> 01:16:27.199 align:start position:0%
think um but I think if we're talking
 
01:16:29.669 --> 01:16:29.679 align:start position:0%
about in other parts of the bill um not
 
01:16:33.629 --> 01:16:33.639 align:start position:0%
combining cannabis with other drugs like
 
01:16:35.110 --> 01:16:35.120 align:start position:0%
nicotine or anything else this is sort
 
01:16:38.110 --> 01:16:38.120 align:start position:0%
of the exact same thing um from a public
 
01:16:40.510 --> 01:16:40.520 align:start position:0%
safety standpoint and you know certainly
 
01:16:43.229 --> 01:16:43.239 align:start position:0%
the medical literature shows that the
 
01:16:45.669 --> 01:16:45.679 align:start position:0%
combination of cannabis and alcohol
 
01:16:47.510 --> 01:16:47.520 align:start position:0%
together have a you know additive
 
01:16:51.030 --> 01:16:51.040 align:start position:0%
influence on uh dri or driving um
 
01:16:53.430 --> 01:16:53.440 align:start position:0%
impairment so I I think we would caution
 
01:16:55.629 --> 01:16:55.639 align:start position:0%
against having that be at least the
 
01:16:57.149 --> 01:16:57.159 align:start position:0%
combination of a of an alcoholic
 
01:16:58.790 --> 01:16:58.800 align:start position:0%
beverage um as being Something That
 
01:16:58.800 --> 01:17:01.709 align:start position:0%
beverage um as being Something That
We're

01:17:01.709 --> 01:17:01.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:05.590 --> 01:17:05.600 align:start position:0%
offering yeah I'm just concerned of how
 
01:17:08.750 --> 01:17:08.760 align:start position:0%
like you know um to do to the doctor's
 
01:17:11.030 --> 01:17:11.040 align:start position:0%
point it's true that this is written as
 
01:17:12.629 --> 01:17:12.639 align:start position:0%
like manufacturing import whatever but
 
01:17:14.189 --> 01:17:14.199 align:start position:0%
if you get if somebody would be caught
 
01:17:16.750 --> 01:17:16.760 align:start position:0%
with with that in the state do we just
 
01:17:18.430 --> 01:17:18.440 align:start position:0%
ignore that and I don't know if it's
 
01:17:19.910 --> 01:17:19.920 align:start position:0%
clearly laid out in here but I think
 
01:17:21.310 --> 01:17:21.320 align:start position:0%
that that's something we we should
 
01:17:22.470 --> 01:17:22.480 align:start position:0%
address because we don't want that to be
 
01:17:23.750 --> 01:17:23.760 align:start position:0%
some sort of weird loophole for
 
01:17:25.750 --> 01:17:25.760 align:start position:0%
legalizing something and then suddenly
 
01:17:27.390 --> 01:17:27.400 align:start position:0%
this product is illegal to manufactur
 
01:17:29.189 --> 01:17:29.199 align:start position:0%
here so you get caught with it you are
 
01:17:31.110 --> 01:17:31.120 align:start position:0%
arrested or something I that's just my
 
01:17:32.590 --> 01:17:32.600 align:start position:0%
concern that that could be sort of a
 
01:17:34.590 --> 01:17:34.600 align:start position:0%
back door way to arrest people for
 
01:17:36.270 --> 01:17:36.280 align:start position:0%
something that shouldn't be and maybe
 
01:17:37.310 --> 01:17:37.320 align:start position:0%
it's fine I don't know what you would
 
01:17:38.669 --> 01:17:38.679 align:start position:0%
arrest them for because they're not in
 
01:17:40.590 --> 01:17:40.600 align:start position:0%
violation of any statute if we legalize
 
01:17:43.149 --> 01:17:43.159 align:start position:0%
marijuana with THC and cannabis is legal
 
01:17:44.830 --> 01:17:44.840 align:start position:0%
and alcohol is already legal in New
 
01:17:46.709 --> 01:17:46.719 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so there would be no violation
 
01:17:49.110 --> 01:17:49.120 align:start position:0%
of law if someone was in possession of a
 
01:17:52.310 --> 01:17:52.320 align:start position:0%
cannabis infused beer um right so in the
 
01:17:53.910 --> 01:17:53.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire there's no law you a police
 
01:17:55.390 --> 01:17:55.400 align:start position:0%
officer could possibly charge a that's
 
01:17:57.990 --> 01:17:58.000 align:start position:0%
good point yeah
 
01:18:01.310 --> 01:18:01.320 align:start position:0%
so would in reading this it appears it
 
01:18:04.270 --> 01:18:04.280 align:start position:0%
would be like picking up a six-pack and
 
01:18:07.430 --> 01:18:07.440 align:start position:0%
mass and driving it up to a campground
 
01:18:10.350 --> 01:18:10.360 align:start position:0%
same same thing it doesn't apply unless
 
01:18:13.430 --> 01:18:13.440 align:start position:0%
you're manufacturing Distributing or
 
01:18:15.709 --> 01:18:15.719 align:start position:0%
selling then you're in violation
 
01:18:17.669 --> 01:18:17.679 align:start position:0%
otherwise you're not in violation so
 
01:18:19.350 --> 01:18:19.360 align:start position:0%
there's no and I guess my point I want
 
01:18:23.750 --> 01:18:23.760 align:start position:0%
to make it semi clear that um those THC
 
01:18:25.590 --> 01:18:25.600 align:start position:0%
infused beverages that are non-alcoholic
 
01:18:27.310 --> 01:18:27.320 align:start position:0%
in nature may come to our Market but the
 
01:18:28.350 --> 01:18:28.360 align:start position:0%
question is I want to make sure they're
 
01:18:30.990 --> 01:18:31.000 align:start position:0%
sold my franchise stores and not
 
01:18:35.030 --> 01:18:35.040 align:start position:0%
in you know the cumin Farms right so we
 
01:18:36.629 --> 01:18:36.639 align:start position:0%
sold they should be a regulated market
 
01:18:38.629 --> 01:18:38.639 align:start position:0%
within our within our franchise stores
 
01:18:41.270 --> 01:18:41.280 align:start position:0%
if you're going to do a THC infused
 
01:18:45.550 --> 01:18:45.560 align:start position:0%
beverage I just um as I read this then
 
01:18:47.990 --> 01:18:48.000 align:start position:0%
um craft breweries in New Hampshire
 
01:18:50.590 --> 01:18:50.600 align:start position:0%
would be prohibited from um
 
01:18:54.350 --> 01:18:54.360 align:start position:0%
manufacturing and selling THC infused
 
01:18:57.870 --> 01:18:57.880 align:start position:0%
products correct correct okay the way
 
01:18:59.430 --> 01:18:59.440 align:start position:0%
this is written right now I just want to
 
01:19:02.550 --> 01:19:02.560 align:start position:0%
say I think the intens uh intensifying
 
01:19:05.070 --> 01:19:05.080 align:start position:0%
the intoxication that that's a public
 
01:19:07.430 --> 01:19:07.440 align:start position:0%
health issue and public safety issue
 
01:19:10.550 --> 01:19:10.560 align:start position:0%
with um you know combination of whether
 
01:19:14.310 --> 01:19:14.320 align:start position:0%
it be M be beverages beer Spirits it's
 
01:19:16.350 --> 01:19:16.360 align:start position:0%
that's a significant concern so it
 
01:19:18.430 --> 01:19:18.440 align:start position:0%
sounds like from the conversation we're
 
01:19:19.430 --> 01:19:19.440 align:start position:0%
okay with the section we're going to
 
01:19:21.350 --> 01:19:21.360 align:start position:0%
leave it alone Chief I just do want to
 
01:19:23.550 --> 01:19:23.560 align:start position:0%
talk about um at some Point make sure in
 
01:19:26.629 --> 01:19:26.639 align:start position:0%
the bill we deal with those non
 
01:19:29.149 --> 01:19:29.159 align:start position:0%
non-alcoholic cannabis infused drinks
 
01:19:30.990 --> 01:19:31.000 align:start position:0%
and making sure that my opinion is those
 
01:19:33.750 --> 01:19:33.760 align:start position:0%
are sold in re in our franchise stores
 
01:19:38.830 --> 01:19:38.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:41.270 --> 01:19:41.280 align:start position:0%
stores sorry Mr chairman we do have a
 
01:19:42.870 --> 01:19:42.880 align:start position:0%
reference to that as the chief just
 
01:19:46.270 --> 01:19:46.280 align:start position:0%
explained to me RSA
 
01:19:46.280 --> 01:19:48.270 align:start position:0%
explained to me RSA
1751

01:19:48.270 --> 01:19:48.280 align:start position:0%
1751
 
01:19:51.590 --> 01:19:51.600 align:start position:0%
uh in title 13 so we can include that
 
01:19:54.430 --> 01:19:54.440 align:start position:0%
language in this if You' like
 
01:19:56.950 --> 01:19:56.960 align:start position:0%
happy to do that thank you so we're good
 
01:20:00.390 --> 01:20:00.400 align:start position:0%
with number f11 going on to
 
01:20:04.790 --> 01:20:04.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:07.189 --> 01:20:07.199 align:start position:0%
system so Chief I assume this is what's
 
01:20:10.229 --> 01:20:10.239 align:start position:0%
commonly known as um seed to seed to
 
01:20:10.239 --> 01:20:12.590 align:start position:0%
commonly known as um seed to seed to
shelf

01:20:12.590 --> 01:20:12.600 align:start position:0%
shelf
 
01:20:12.600 --> 01:20:14.870 align:start position:0%
shelf
tracking

01:20:14.870 --> 01:20:14.880 align:start position:0%
tracking
 
01:20:17.990 --> 01:20:18.000 align:start position:0%
yes um I apologize in an earlier section
 
01:20:19.590 --> 01:20:19.600 align:start position:0%
I missed something that new Futures had
 
01:20:20.910 --> 01:20:20.920 align:start position:0%
lifted up from a public health
 
01:20:22.470 --> 01:20:22.480 align:start position:0%
perspective so I was wondering when it's
 
01:20:23.790 --> 01:20:23.800 align:start position:0%
when it's appropriate if we could go
 
01:20:27.149 --> 01:20:27.159 align:start position:0%
back to um 318 f8 and just have new
 
01:20:28.390 --> 01:20:28.400 align:start position:0%
Futures come up for a second let's
 
01:20:29.669 --> 01:20:29.679 align:start position:0%
finish the tracking and then we because
 
01:20:30.830 --> 01:20:30.840 align:start position:0%
we already propped that up and we'll go
 
01:20:33.510 --> 01:20:33.520 align:start position:0%
back change you want are we okay with
 
01:20:37.270 --> 01:20:37.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:39.390 --> 01:20:39.400 align:start position:0%
system great all right Frank what was
 
01:20:41.070 --> 01:20:41.080 align:start position:0%
the change you wanted to go back to what
 
01:20:49.629 --> 01:20:49.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:51.709 --> 01:20:51.719 align:start position:0%
Dave turn your mic
 
01:20:51.719 --> 01:20:53.950 align:start position:0%
Dave turn your mic
on

01:20:53.950 --> 01:20:53.960 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:20:55.830 --> 01:20:55.840 align:start position:0%
the tracking system now that just joged
 
01:20:58.189 --> 01:20:58.199 align:start position:0%
something on my my mind here going back
 
01:21:00.470 --> 01:21:00.480 align:start position:0%
to the ID section I know this has to do
 
01:21:04.149 --> 01:21:04.159 align:start position:0%
with inventory but if if we're not
 
01:21:07.189 --> 01:21:07.199 align:start position:0%
taking people's names and there's no
 
01:21:09.070 --> 01:21:09.080 align:start position:0%
record if somebody buys marijuana and
 
01:21:11.910 --> 01:21:11.920 align:start position:0%
I'm not saying I'm in favor of of doing
 
01:21:17.390 --> 01:21:17.400 align:start position:0%
that but if we have a no matter what um
 
01:21:19.310 --> 01:21:19.320 align:start position:0%
what limit we have whether it's two or
 
01:21:24.110 --> 01:21:24.120 align:start position:0%
four uh ounces of uh marijuana
 
01:21:25.830 --> 01:21:25.840 align:start position:0%
what what would be in place to stop
 
01:21:27.510 --> 01:21:27.520 align:start position:0%
somebody from going to a store in
 
01:21:29.629 --> 01:21:29.639 align:start position:0%
Manchester hypothetically and then go in
 
01:21:32.270 --> 01:21:32.280 align:start position:0%
a conquer in getting eight
 
01:21:35.030 --> 01:21:35.040 align:start position:0%
ounces and I'm just curious do we have
 
01:21:37.830 --> 01:21:37.840 align:start position:0%
any safeguards with that it's or is it
 
01:21:39.350 --> 01:21:39.360 align:start position:0%
just like a lick store where you you
 
01:21:39.360 --> 01:21:42.229 align:start position:0%
just like a lick store where you you
could

01:21:42.229 --> 01:21:42.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:44.510 --> 01:21:44.520 align:start position:0%
just let me turn that back on so first I
 
01:21:45.790 --> 01:21:45.800 align:start position:0%
am going to make one change to the
 
01:21:47.669 --> 01:21:47.679 align:start position:0%
section and I'm going to add the word
 
01:21:49.270 --> 01:21:49.280 align:start position:0%
product tracking system because we're
 
01:21:50.830 --> 01:21:50.840 align:start position:0%
not talking about tracking people in
 
01:21:51.950 --> 01:21:51.960 align:start position:0%
this language we're talking about
 
01:21:53.470 --> 01:21:53.480 align:start position:0%
tracking the product product from seed
 
01:21:56.149 --> 01:21:56.159 align:start position:0%
to sale to making sure we we can account
 
01:21:58.750 --> 01:21:58.760 align:start position:0%
for anything for whatever reason but not
 
01:22:00.709 --> 01:22:00.719 align:start position:0%
including the actual sale right seed to
 
01:22:03.310 --> 01:22:03.320 align:start position:0%
shelf is really the the title um but so
 
01:22:04.270 --> 01:22:04.280 align:start position:0%
I'm going to add I'm just going to
 
01:22:06.310 --> 01:22:06.320 align:start position:0%
change 12 to read product tracking
 
01:22:09.149 --> 01:22:09.159 align:start position:0%
system so it's clear what we're tracking
 
01:22:10.910 --> 01:22:10.920 align:start position:0%
I understand that I read the I read that
 
01:22:13.149 --> 01:22:13.159 align:start position:0%
but it just goes back to the earlier
 
01:22:17.470 --> 01:22:17.480 align:start position:0%
section where we uh talked about not
 
01:22:19.390 --> 01:22:19.400 align:start position:0%
taking anybody's Identity or
 
01:22:22.870 --> 01:22:22.880 align:start position:0%
identification or anything is would
 
01:22:25.270 --> 01:22:25.280 align:start position:0%
really be no stopping anybody they could
 
01:22:27.950 --> 01:22:27.960 align:start position:0%
go to every single store and I'm just
 
01:22:29.550 --> 01:22:29.560 align:start position:0%
curious is there anything liquor does
 
01:22:31.590 --> 01:22:31.600 align:start position:0%
regular investigations I understand from
 
01:22:34.189 --> 01:22:34.199 align:start position:0%
people who are buying alcohol in large
 
01:22:36.950 --> 01:22:36.960 align:start position:0%
quantities and moving it about and so
 
01:22:38.669 --> 01:22:38.679 align:start position:0%
I'm sure this would fall under that same
 
01:22:42.149 --> 01:22:42.159 align:start position:0%
kind of idea is that um they would tra
 
01:22:45.590 --> 01:22:45.600 align:start position:0%
you know to a certain extent if if a if
 
01:22:47.070 --> 01:22:47.080 align:start position:0%
they see somebody coming in on a regular
 
01:22:48.510 --> 01:22:48.520 align:start position:0%
basis I'm sure it'll trigger some sort
 
01:22:50.870 --> 01:22:50.880 align:start position:0%
of Investigation
 
01:22:52.990 --> 01:22:53.000 align:start position:0%
somewhere but hard hard hard to do
 
01:22:55.870 --> 01:22:55.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:59.070 --> 01:22:59.080 align:start position:0%
illegal well that's what that that's
 
01:23:01.390 --> 01:23:01.400 align:start position:0%
what other other states I I believe do
 
01:23:03.910 --> 01:23:03.920 align:start position:0%
do that but and that's how they're able
 
01:23:06.830 --> 01:23:06.840 align:start position:0%
to if somebody goes into one store stops
 
01:23:09.910 --> 01:23:09.920 align:start position:0%
them from buying more at another
 
01:23:12.669 --> 01:23:12.679 align:start position:0%
store well as with alcohol you can if
 
01:23:15.510 --> 01:23:15.520 align:start position:0%
someone wants to someone buys a bottle
 
01:23:19.790 --> 01:23:19.800 align:start position:0%
in Manchester and drives to colbrook and
 
01:23:22.189 --> 01:23:22.199 align:start position:0%
you know is at an event and the event
 
01:23:24.750 --> 01:23:24.760 align:start position:0%
runs out and that person goes to a store
 
01:23:27.110 --> 01:23:27.120 align:start position:0%
in colbrook in the same day there's
 
01:23:29.629 --> 01:23:29.639 align:start position:0%
there's no tracking of that and this
 
01:23:32.229 --> 01:23:32.239 align:start position:0%
would be this would be the same in any
 
01:23:34.590 --> 01:23:34.600 align:start position:0%
of the we don't we don't track anything
 
01:23:37.310 --> 01:23:37.320 align:start position:0%
as far as what people buy in in the
 
01:23:37.320 --> 01:23:39.149 align:start position:0%
as far as what people buy in in the
liquor

01:23:39.149 --> 01:23:39.159 align:start position:0%
liquor
 
01:23:41.189 --> 01:23:41.199 align:start position:0%
stores okay just
 
01:23:44.830 --> 01:23:44.840 align:start position:0%
one Jim that record there I just wanted
 
01:23:47.790 --> 01:23:47.800 align:start position:0%
to say we we do track that people buy
 
01:23:50.310 --> 01:23:50.320 align:start position:0%
firearms and having marijuana and
 
01:23:54.430 --> 01:23:54.440 align:start position:0%
Firearms at the same time is definitely
 
01:23:54.440 --> 01:23:56.229 align:start position:0%
Firearms at the same time is definitely
punishable

01:23:56.229 --> 01:23:56.239 align:start position:0%
punishable
 
01:23:58.070 --> 01:23:58.080 align:start position:0%
ferally so we're getting a little bit
 
01:23:59.709 --> 01:23:59.719 align:start position:0%
off off kilter from what the actual
 
01:24:00.870 --> 01:24:00.880 align:start position:0%
title is right again we're talking about
 
01:24:02.070 --> 01:24:02.080 align:start position:0%
product tracking right here we can come
 
01:24:03.350 --> 01:24:03.360 align:start position:0%
back and see if there's something else
 
01:24:04.629 --> 01:24:04.639 align:start position:0%
if there's things missing we come back
 
01:24:07.229 --> 01:24:07.239 align:start position:0%
to the idea of identification uh
 
01:24:09.149 --> 01:24:09.159 align:start position:0%
information again right now the only
 
01:24:10.550 --> 01:24:10.560 align:start position:0%
reason we would look at someone's
 
01:24:13.070 --> 01:24:13.080 align:start position:0%
identification is to validate H and then
 
01:24:14.470 --> 01:24:14.480 align:start position:0%
give it back and we would not record
 
01:24:19.629 --> 01:24:19.639 align:start position:0%
that data per the bill Chief just one uh
 
01:24:22.030 --> 01:24:22.040 align:start position:0%
um perhaps consideration on the third
 
01:24:22.040 --> 01:24:23.229 align:start position:0%
um perhaps consideration on the third
line

01:24:23.229 --> 01:24:23.239 align:start position:0%
line
 
01:24:25.790 --> 01:24:25.800 align:start position:0%
adding tracking the
 
01:24:30.430 --> 01:24:30.440 align:start position:0%
cultivation uh manufactur transfer um um
 
01:24:32.830 --> 01:24:32.840 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure whether or not um that's
 
01:24:35.590 --> 01:24:35.600 align:start position:0%
needed but to certainly make sure that
 
01:24:38.590 --> 01:24:38.600 align:start position:0%
uh the tracking starts from the time
 
01:24:46.790 --> 01:24:46.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:49.590 --> 01:24:49.600 align:start position:0%
cultivated yeah I I think they they were
 
01:24:51.149 --> 01:24:51.159 align:start position:0%
being a little all-inclusive because
 
01:24:52.669 --> 01:24:52.679 align:start position:0%
they just said anytime you trans transer
 
01:24:54.189 --> 01:24:54.199 align:start position:0%
product from one license to another
 
01:24:56.310 --> 01:24:56.320 align:start position:0%
license lead it's got to be tracked so
 
01:24:57.990 --> 01:24:58.000 align:start position:0%
whether you're moving from a cultivator
 
01:24:59.950 --> 01:24:59.960 align:start position:0%
to a manufacturer the product has to be
 
01:25:02.149 --> 01:25:02.159 align:start position:0%
tracked and I'm assuming somewhere in
 
01:25:04.149 --> 01:25:04.159 align:start position:0%
rules they'll have they're going to deal
 
01:25:06.189 --> 01:25:06.199 align:start position:0%
with cultivators and quantity they
 
01:25:08.350 --> 01:25:08.360 align:start position:0%
cultivate you know reg regulations
 
01:25:10.629 --> 01:25:10.639 align:start position:0%
around cultivation and quantities so
 
01:25:12.590 --> 01:25:12.600 align:start position:0%
they purchasing of seeds what happens if
 
01:25:14.590 --> 01:25:14.600 align:start position:0%
they have Surplus where that goes and
 
01:25:16.070 --> 01:25:16.080 align:start position:0%
that all that will be done in rule so
 
01:25:19.629 --> 01:25:19.639 align:start position:0%
all that'll be tracked under other
 
01:25:23.390 --> 01:25:23.400 align:start position:0%
parts okay moving on to
 
01:25:27.070 --> 01:25:27.080 align:start position:0%
um f13 Mr sorry yes
 
01:25:30.550 --> 01:25:30.560 align:start position:0%
she I was could we go back to um oh y
 
01:25:32.870 --> 01:25:32.880 align:start position:0%
good uh f8 it' be okay to have Kate come
 
01:25:36.030 --> 01:25:36.040 align:start position:0%
up from new futures for a second thanks
 
01:25:39.870 --> 01:25:39.880 align:start position:0%
so f8 just remind you this is um around
 
01:25:44.629 --> 01:25:44.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:47.510 --> 01:25:47.520 align:start position:0%
warnings thank you I appreciate this um
 
01:25:49.629 --> 01:25:49.639 align:start position:0%
just a couple points I wanted to point
 
01:25:52.629 --> 01:25:52.639 align:start position:0%
out during the warning label um an
 
01:25:55.109 --> 01:25:55.119 align:start position:0%
information section I think one thing
 
01:25:56.950 --> 01:25:56.960 align:start position:0%
that the commission really should
 
01:26:00.109 --> 01:26:00.119 align:start position:0%
consider um is prevention strategies in
 
01:26:02.669 --> 01:26:02.679 align:start position:0%
terms of the latest information we have
 
01:26:04.830 --> 01:26:04.840 align:start position:0%
from the uh National Poison Control
 
01:26:06.189 --> 01:26:06.199 align:start position:0%
Center and the New Hampshire Poison
 
01:26:09.149 --> 01:26:09.159 align:start position:0%
Control Center we're seeing a 1400%
 
01:26:11.590 --> 01:26:11.600 align:start position:0%
increase Nationwide on
 
01:26:13.990 --> 01:26:14.000 align:start position:0%
ingestions since uh
 
01:26:16.390 --> 01:26:16.400 align:start position:0%
2017 um not to say that's a good thing
 
01:26:17.950 --> 01:26:17.960 align:start position:0%
or a bad thing as far as whether
 
01:26:19.550 --> 01:26:19.560 align:start position:0%
commercialization should come into the
 
01:26:22.270 --> 01:26:22.280 align:start position:0%
state but we have really uh learned
 
01:26:24.950 --> 01:26:24.960 align:start position:0%
learned a lot about prevention practices
 
01:26:27.669 --> 01:26:27.679 align:start position:0%
um one thing to consider is plain
 
01:26:30.229 --> 01:26:30.239 align:start position:0%
packaging of edible products I know that
 
01:26:32.189 --> 01:26:32.199 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of nuances there as
 
01:26:34.510 --> 01:26:34.520 align:start position:0%
presented by the commission another
 
01:26:37.270 --> 01:26:37.280 align:start position:0%
thing that could be considered is uh
 
01:26:39.270 --> 01:26:39.280 align:start position:0%
what we are learning a lot of success
 
01:26:40.750 --> 01:26:40.760 align:start position:0%
from our prevention Partners In the
 
01:26:43.109 --> 01:26:43.119 align:start position:0%
state especially those who are bordering
 
01:26:45.990 --> 01:26:46.000 align:start position:0%
um states that are legal is the use of
 
01:26:49.470 --> 01:26:49.480 align:start position:0%
uh medication lock boxes um where
 
01:26:51.870 --> 01:26:51.880 align:start position:0%
parents families they have these uh
 
01:26:54.750 --> 01:26:54.760 align:start position:0%
tools to lock up any cannabis products
 
01:26:56.629 --> 01:26:56.639 align:start position:0%
that may be loose especially Edibles and
 
01:26:59.470 --> 01:26:59.480 align:start position:0%
appealing to kids um what we have
 
01:27:02.910 --> 01:27:02.920 align:start position:0%
suggested is that um retail sales have
 
01:27:06.430 --> 01:27:06.440 align:start position:0%
for sale um medication lock boxes these
 
01:27:08.590 --> 01:27:08.600 align:start position:0%
have been proven to be a really
 
01:27:10.629 --> 01:27:10.639 align:start position:0%
successful tool with as we know
 
01:27:13.189 --> 01:27:13.199 align:start position:0%
prescription drugs um now we're seeing
 
01:27:15.750 --> 01:27:15.760 align:start position:0%
it more with cannabis um again it would
 
01:27:17.830 --> 01:27:17.840 align:start position:0%
be a requirement for those stores to
 
01:27:20.030 --> 01:27:20.040 align:start position:0%
sell those products just like we would
 
01:27:21.870 --> 01:27:21.880 align:start position:0%
have those information materials there
 
01:27:24.430 --> 01:27:24.440 align:start position:0%
about locking up your products have
 
01:27:27.350 --> 01:27:27.360 align:start position:0%
those there too um there are you know
 
01:27:28.990 --> 01:27:29.000 align:start position:0%
again different prevention strategies
 
01:27:31.910 --> 01:27:31.920 align:start position:0%
that we learn um and with cannabis this
 
01:27:33.590 --> 01:27:33.600 align:start position:0%
is what we've um found has been
 
01:27:36.109 --> 01:27:36.119 align:start position:0%
successful so that's a suggestion um
 
01:27:37.669 --> 01:27:37.679 align:start position:0%
from new Futures that I think can be
 
01:27:40.709 --> 01:27:40.719 align:start position:0%
really workable and a very creative
 
01:27:45.669 --> 01:27:45.679 align:start position:0%
approach Mr mik so again um I know we
 
01:27:49.030 --> 01:27:49.040 align:start position:0%
talked about requirements of having a
 
01:27:51.750 --> 01:27:51.760 align:start position:0%
that every franchise store sell um a
 
01:27:54.030 --> 01:27:54.040 align:start position:0%
lock box a medication lock box and I
 
01:27:56.470 --> 01:27:56.480 align:start position:0%
don't know where maybe you can tell us
 
01:27:58.229 --> 01:27:58.239 align:start position:0%
next meeting where in the rules we think
 
01:27:59.790 --> 01:27:59.800 align:start position:0%
we should put that
 
01:28:02.750 --> 01:28:02.760 align:start position:0%
requirement happy to do that Mr
 
01:28:04.709 --> 01:28:04.719 align:start position:0%
chairman all
 
01:28:07.470 --> 01:28:07.480 align:start position:0%
right so we're on to enactment of
 
01:28:09.149 --> 01:28:09.159 align:start position:0%
Municipal ordinance say
 
01:28:12.950 --> 01:28:12.960 align:start position:0%
13 Chief so on on this particular one
 
01:28:15.550 --> 01:28:15.560 align:start position:0%
there perhaps needs to be a couple of um
 
01:28:19.390 --> 01:28:19.400 align:start position:0%
change minor changes here uh to ensure
 
01:28:22.109 --> 01:28:22.119 align:start position:0%
we're we're looking at an opt-in and non
 
01:28:23.510 --> 01:28:23.520 align:start position:0%
oped out process and that would be
 
01:28:25.990 --> 01:28:26.000 align:start position:0%
striking the reference to the election
 
01:28:27.870 --> 01:28:27.880 align:start position:0%
held in November of
 
01:28:31.350 --> 01:28:31.360 align:start position:0%
24 and then later on where it reflects
 
01:28:34.350 --> 01:28:34.360 align:start position:0%
July 1 to 25 and perhaps consider
 
01:28:36.070 --> 01:28:36.080 align:start position:0%
language that should say prior to the
 
01:28:39.750 --> 01:28:39.760 align:start position:0%
approval of any licensed establishment
 
01:28:41.870 --> 01:28:41.880 align:start position:0%
to manufacture cultivate or sell
 
01:28:44.470 --> 01:28:44.480 align:start position:0%
cannabis product in that
 
01:28:48.750 --> 01:28:48.760 align:start position:0%
municipality right um that uh it goes
 
01:28:51.390 --> 01:28:51.400 align:start position:0%
forward from there that the licensing
 
01:28:53.790 --> 01:28:53.800 align:start position:0%
should be um approved by the
 
01:28:56.189 --> 01:28:56.199 align:start position:0%
municipality uh in advance and conformed
 
01:28:58.629 --> 01:28:58.639 align:start position:0%
to whatever the municipality loaning
 
01:29:01.350 --> 01:29:01.360 align:start position:0%
zoning ordinances may be just to ensure
 
01:29:03.310 --> 01:29:03.320 align:start position:0%
that we have an opt-in provision here
 
01:29:12.030 --> 01:29:12.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:15.750 --> 01:29:15.760 align:start position:0%
out I believe that the nhma also sent
 
01:29:19.310 --> 01:29:19.320 align:start position:0%
correspondence to Senator abbis on that
 
01:29:20.550 --> 01:29:20.560 align:start position:0%
point as
 
01:29:26.229 --> 01:29:26.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:30.070 --> 01:29:30.080 align:start position:0%
13th Mr chair I I think that's a very
 
01:29:32.229 --> 01:29:32.239 align:start position:0%
let's talk about section one first right
 
01:29:34.830 --> 01:29:34.840 align:start position:0%
so this is strictly the opin provision
 
01:29:36.430 --> 01:29:36.440 align:start position:0%
um whether the town was I agree we
 
01:29:38.950 --> 01:29:38.960 align:start position:0%
should strike the words held in November
 
01:29:41.910 --> 01:29:41.920 align:start position:0%
24 and just say at the banal election
 
01:29:44.510 --> 01:29:44.520 align:start position:0%
period right because obviously no one's
 
01:29:45.950 --> 01:29:45.960 align:start position:0%
going to put it on the November 24
 
01:29:47.709 --> 01:29:47.719 align:start position:0%
ballot by by the time we're done not
 
01:29:50.910 --> 01:29:50.920 align:start position:0%
sure we'll have a law by then um but
 
01:29:53.470 --> 01:29:53.480 align:start position:0%
um so what we can strike held in
 
01:29:55.390 --> 01:29:55.400 align:start position:0%
November 24 and just say it has to be on
 
01:29:57.350 --> 01:29:57.360 align:start position:0%
every two years is your option to opt in
 
01:30:02.229 --> 01:30:02.239 align:start position:0%
for a town um is every two years
 
01:30:06.070 --> 01:30:06.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:09.550 --> 01:30:09.560 align:start position:0%
wording interesting because in theory
 
01:30:11.109 --> 01:30:11.119 align:start position:0%
you could they're asking for two
 
01:30:14.910 --> 01:30:14.920 align:start position:0%
separate questions on this ballot one of
 
01:30:17.910 --> 01:30:17.920 align:start position:0%
which is do1 operation of cannabis
 
01:30:19.310 --> 01:30:19.320 align:start position:0%
establishments which could be any
 
01:30:21.870 --> 01:30:21.880 align:start position:0%
licensed type whether it's um
 
01:30:24.629 --> 01:30:24.639 align:start position:0%
conservation manufacturer or
 
01:30:27.229 --> 01:30:27.239 align:start position:0%
retail um but then the second one is
 
01:30:30.470 --> 01:30:30.480 align:start position:0%
specifically to um
 
01:30:30.480 --> 01:30:34.350 align:start position:0%
specifically to um
retail

01:30:34.350 --> 01:30:34.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:37.109 --> 01:30:37.119 align:start position:0%
um yes Mr chair that's one passes in the
 
01:30:37.119 --> 01:30:38.870 align:start position:0%
um yes Mr chair that's one passes in the
other

01:30:38.870 --> 01:30:38.880 align:start position:0%
other
 
01:30:42.550 --> 01:30:42.560 align:start position:0%
yeah confusing um having both of those
 
01:30:49.070 --> 01:30:49.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:51.350 --> 01:30:51.360 align:start position:0%
anybody I think it's critical to keep
 
01:30:53.990 --> 01:30:54.000 align:start position:0%
the op language there only because with
 
01:30:56.109 --> 01:30:56.119 align:start position:0%
the therapeutic cannabis local control
 
01:30:59.109 --> 01:30:59.119 align:start position:0%
was something that was completely um
 
01:31:01.229 --> 01:31:01.239 align:start position:0%
non-existent and so we want to make sure
 
01:31:03.390 --> 01:31:03.400 align:start position:0%
that the towns are my question is we
 
01:31:04.629 --> 01:31:04.639 align:start position:0%
have two different questions that would
 
01:31:06.310 --> 01:31:06.320 align:start position:0%
be on the same ballot which in theory
 
01:31:07.830 --> 01:31:07.840 align:start position:0%
you could pass one and fail the other
 
01:31:10.070 --> 01:31:10.080 align:start position:0%
one for some reason okay um and it's
 
01:31:11.550 --> 01:31:11.560 align:start position:0%
kind of confusing you're saying yes we
 
01:31:13.950 --> 01:31:13.960 align:start position:0%
want cist establishments but then you're
 
01:31:15.430 --> 01:31:15.440 align:start position:0%
saying yes also we want retail
 
01:31:17.990 --> 01:31:18.000 align:start position:0%
establishments either or two and so I
 
01:31:20.430 --> 01:31:20.440 align:start position:0%
think it should be I I would do away
 
01:31:22.030 --> 01:31:22.040 align:start position:0%
with the second question altogether just
 
01:31:23.310 --> 01:31:23.320 align:start position:0%
say should we allow the operation of
 
01:31:25.030 --> 01:31:25.040 align:start position:0%
Cabas establishments within the town
 
01:31:26.870 --> 01:31:26.880 align:start position:0%
period end of story that's the question
 
01:31:29.510 --> 01:31:29.520 align:start position:0%
on yeah and then it's clear that it
 
01:31:30.510 --> 01:31:30.520 align:start position:0%
could be anything it could be a
 
01:31:32.669 --> 01:31:32.679 align:start position:0%
cultivation a manufacturer distributor
 
01:31:34.950 --> 01:31:34.960 align:start position:0%
or a retail store but it's cannabis
 
01:31:36.709 --> 01:31:36.719 align:start position:0%
establishment does that make sense to
 
01:31:39.990 --> 01:31:40.000 align:start position:0%
everybody Jordan yes that makes sense
 
01:31:41.590 --> 01:31:41.600 align:start position:0%
but at the same time you've got two
 
01:31:43.229 --> 01:31:43.239 align:start position:0%
different types of activities taking
 
01:31:45.590 --> 01:31:45.600 align:start position:0%
place one is Agricultural and the other
 
01:31:45.600 --> 01:31:46.350 align:start position:0%
place one is Agricultural and the other
is

01:31:46.350 --> 01:31:46.360 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:31:49.910 --> 01:31:49.920 align:start position:0%
retail so your your zoning would have to
 
01:31:51.430 --> 01:31:51.440 align:start position:0%
uh take those into consider we get the
 
01:31:52.990 --> 01:31:53.000 align:start position:0%
zoning which is in the second piece
 
01:31:55.430 --> 01:31:55.440 align:start position:0%
right so the first piece is is strictly
 
01:31:58.189 --> 01:31:58.199 align:start position:0%
about the opin provision and I think we
 
01:31:59.870 --> 01:31:59.880 align:start position:0%
just have one question and says shall we
 
01:32:01.070 --> 01:32:01.080 align:start position:0%
allow the operation of Canabis
 
01:32:02.430 --> 01:32:02.440 align:start position:0%
established within the city or town
 
01:32:05.430 --> 01:32:05.440 align:start position:0%
period right and then strike the next
 
01:32:07.870 --> 01:32:07.880 align:start position:0%
question and then the rest of it still
 
01:32:13.189 --> 01:32:13.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:17.229 --> 01:32:17.239 align:start position:0%
um I think that's good point and then
 
01:32:20.109 --> 01:32:20.119 align:start position:0%
there that's starting even the
 
01:32:22.629 --> 01:32:22.639 align:start position:0%
um the signal approv the operation and
 
01:32:24.270 --> 01:32:24.280 align:start position:0%
Council session may start applying for
 
01:32:27.790 --> 01:32:27.800 align:start position:0%
approval on July 1 I I tend to get rid
 
01:32:30.310 --> 01:32:30.320 align:start position:0%
of that myself because the second half
 
01:32:32.149 --> 01:32:32.159 align:start position:0%
of this is municipalities need time if
 
01:32:34.870 --> 01:32:34.880 align:start position:0%
they opt in to write zoning ordinances
 
01:32:36.270 --> 01:32:36.280 align:start position:0%
to deal with the fact that they're now
 
01:32:37.870 --> 01:32:37.880 align:start position:0%
allowing it they need zoning ordinances
 
01:32:39.910 --> 01:32:39.920 align:start position:0%
to go along with it so I I I would like
 
01:32:42.910 --> 01:32:42.920 align:start position:0%
to strike that se that July 1 date and
 
01:32:45.830 --> 01:32:45.840 align:start position:0%
just you know precisely because you're
 
01:32:47.669 --> 01:32:47.679 align:start position:0%
you're hamstringing what the the time
 
01:33:03.950 --> 01:33:03.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:06.870 --> 01:33:06.880 align:start position:0%
corre I think we can strike everything
 
01:33:09.070 --> 01:33:09.080 align:start position:0%
from right again after that second
 
01:33:12.629 --> 01:33:12.639 align:start position:0%
question if all the way down to the
 
01:33:15.669 --> 01:33:15.679 align:start position:0%
date right I don't know that we have to
 
01:33:19.990 --> 01:33:20.000 align:start position:0%
put any timeline into um their approval
 
01:33:22.070 --> 01:33:22.080 align:start position:0%
processes passes and then can start
 
01:33:23.830 --> 01:33:23.840 align:start position:0%
applying with planning board but they
 
01:33:29.590 --> 01:33:29.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:31.550 --> 01:33:31.560 align:start position:0%
place and then there's a recount
 
01:33:33.189 --> 01:33:33.199 align:start position:0%
procedure which is typical municipality
 
01:33:33.199 --> 01:33:37.790 align:start position:0%
procedure which is typical municipality
recount

01:33:37.790 --> 01:33:37.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:39.870 --> 01:33:39.880 align:start position:0%
processes and there's a clear language
 
01:33:42.310 --> 01:33:42.320 align:start position:0%
that obviously if my town town of sanon
 
01:33:43.950 --> 01:33:43.960 align:start position:0%
decided it wasn't going to legalize any
 
01:33:46.750 --> 01:33:46.760 align:start position:0%
c Canabis establishments it still means
 
01:33:48.470 --> 01:33:48.480 align:start position:0%
I can drive through the town of sanon
 
01:33:50.310 --> 01:33:50.320 align:start position:0%
Interstate 93 to get to to North Country
 
01:33:53.669 --> 01:33:53.679 align:start position:0%
with C prod get so that's not that's not
 
01:33:53.679 --> 01:33:54.910 align:start position:0%
with C prod get so that's not that's not
in

01:33:54.910 --> 01:33:54.920 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:33:59.750 --> 01:33:59.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:02.709 --> 01:34:02.719 align:start position:0%
zoning any questions about
 
01:34:06.109 --> 01:34:06.119 align:start position:0%
this comments again this just allows
 
01:34:07.910 --> 01:34:07.920 align:start position:0%
local municipalities to set zoning
 
01:34:09.629 --> 01:34:09.639 align:start position:0%
restrictions there are some zoning
 
01:34:11.070 --> 01:34:11.080 align:start position:0%
requirements in the next section we're
 
01:34:13.790 --> 01:34:13.800 align:start position:0%
going to talk about about schools um
 
01:34:17.390 --> 01:34:17.400 align:start position:0%
that will preempt local zoning um but
 
01:34:20.510 --> 01:34:20.520 align:start position:0%
this is allows for them to designate
 
01:34:22.430 --> 01:34:22.440 align:start position:0%
only allowed in our Comm commercial Zone
 
01:34:24.189 --> 01:34:24.199 align:start position:0%
kind of thing
 
01:34:28.070 --> 01:34:28.080 align:start position:0%
so agricultural only in the agricultural
 
01:34:32.189 --> 01:34:32.199 align:start position:0%
Zone they write those rules nothing on
 
01:34:35.070 --> 01:34:35.080 align:start position:0%
number section two so we're good there
 
01:34:38.430 --> 01:34:38.440 align:start position:0%
um 318 F14 restrictions on location near
 
01:34:40.270 --> 01:34:40.280 align:start position:0%
schools I will tell you I've got lots of
 
01:34:44.310 --> 01:34:44.320 align:start position:0%
conversation about this um the 2,000 ft
 
01:34:47.109 --> 01:34:47.119 align:start position:0%
seems to be extremely exclud uh makes it
 
01:34:48.669 --> 01:34:48.679 align:start position:0%
so they're going to be in some towns you
 
01:34:50.550 --> 01:34:50.560 align:start position:0%
could never do it because they have so
 
01:34:52.950 --> 01:34:52.960 align:start position:0%
many schools um that you would never be
 
01:34:55.070 --> 01:34:55.080 align:start position:0%
able to have a facility in there even if
 
01:34:57.390 --> 01:34:57.400 align:start position:0%
they voted to allow one um the
 
01:35:00.229 --> 01:35:00.239 align:start position:0%
recommendation was to look at other
 
01:35:01.950 --> 01:35:01.960 align:start position:0%
statutes where we have zoning ordinances
 
01:35:03.669 --> 01:35:03.679 align:start position:0%
around usually it's vape shops and
 
01:35:06.470 --> 01:35:06.480 align:start position:0%
pornography around schools and churches
 
01:35:08.990 --> 01:35:09.000 align:start position:0%
um and use similar language as that um
 
01:35:11.590 --> 01:35:11.600 align:start position:0%
and Sim similar distances to that but
 
01:35:14.550 --> 01:35:14.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:17.629 --> 01:35:17.639 align:start position:0%
conversation yes Mr chair thank you um
 
01:35:20.430 --> 01:35:20.440 align:start position:0%
we would recommend that in addition to
 
01:35:22.669 --> 01:35:22.679 align:start position:0%
schools that we also include community
 
01:35:24.470 --> 01:35:24.480 align:start position:0%
colleges colleges or
 
01:35:28.950 --> 01:35:28.960 align:start position:0%
universities uh in in this uh particular
 
01:35:32.030 --> 01:35:32.040 align:start position:0%
section particularly since uh the
 
01:35:34.950 --> 01:35:34.960 align:start position:0%
majority of those folks fall within
 
01:35:38.590 --> 01:35:38.600 align:start position:0%
the time uh the age frame of of being
 
01:35:41.070 --> 01:35:41.080 align:start position:0%
exposed um from a public health
 
01:35:43.990 --> 01:35:44.000 align:start position:0%
perspective at
 
01:35:46.830 --> 01:35:46.840 align:start position:0%
risk so your recommendation Chief is to
 
01:35:46.840 --> 01:35:48.109 align:start position:0%
risk so your recommendation Chief is to
include

01:35:48.109 --> 01:35:48.119 align:start position:0%
include
 
01:35:50.870 --> 01:35:50.880 align:start position:0%
colleges um in the distance restriction
 
01:35:52.950 --> 01:35:52.960 align:start position:0%
from possible cannabis retail loc
 
01:35:55.430 --> 01:35:55.440 align:start position:0%
cannabis locations community colleges
 
01:35:58.470 --> 01:35:58.480 align:start position:0%
universities right comments on that
 
01:36:04.830 --> 01:36:04.840 align:start position:0%
Chief Joe U Mr chair uh title 13 section
 
01:36:08.510 --> 01:36:08.520 align:start position:0%
1771 has to do with state liquor stores
 
01:36:12.149 --> 01:36:12.159 align:start position:0%
and that is that no newly established
 
01:36:15.430 --> 01:36:15.440 align:start position:0%
state store shall be operated within 200
 
01:36:18.709 --> 01:36:18.719 align:start position:0%
feet of any public or private school
 
01:36:21.870 --> 01:36:21.880 align:start position:0%
church chapel or Parish
 
01:36:25.950 --> 01:36:25.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:29.709 --> 01:36:29.719 align:start position:0%
record Parish I think the parish is a
 
01:36:32.910 --> 01:36:32.920 align:start position:0%
large area it includes entire
 
01:36:35.709 --> 01:36:35.719 align:start position:0%
towns well I think
 
01:36:38.070 --> 01:36:38.080 align:start position:0%
they're excuse me represent it says
 
01:36:38.080 --> 01:36:39.270 align:start position:0%
they're excuse me represent it says
Parish

01:36:39.270 --> 01:36:39.280 align:start position:0%
Parish
 
01:36:41.470 --> 01:36:41.480 align:start position:0%
house thank
 
01:36:44.790 --> 01:36:44.800 align:start position:0%
you I was to say uh 200 feet is
 
01:36:47.709 --> 01:36:47.719 align:start position:0%
inadequate I think with with cannabis I
 
01:36:50.149 --> 01:36:50.159 align:start position:0%
I I know that uh the city of lonia has
 
01:36:53.070 --> 01:36:53.080 align:start position:0%
had some issues with a vape shop that's
 
01:36:56.510 --> 01:36:56.520 align:start position:0%
just right um within site and shouting
 
01:36:58.590 --> 01:36:58.600 align:start position:0%
distance of this school so I don't think
 
01:37:01.990 --> 01:37:02.000 align:start position:0%
that that would be adequate 200 feet it
 
01:37:04.390 --> 01:37:04.400 align:start position:0%
would stay with the 2,000 feet just for
 
01:37:06.430 --> 01:37:06.440 align:start position:0%
the record I'm I'm not a proponent I'm
 
01:37:10.229 --> 01:37:10.239 align:start position:0%
just of yeah what footage it is I'm just
 
01:37:13.109 --> 01:37:13.119 align:start position:0%
2,000 feet uh to your point would
 
01:37:16.350 --> 01:37:16.360 align:start position:0%
exclude many cities and towns from
 
01:37:19.189 --> 01:37:19.199 align:start position:0%
having a a cannabis location and I was
 
01:37:21.709 --> 01:37:21.719 align:start position:0%
just referring to the statute for lior
 
01:37:24.229 --> 01:37:24.239 align:start position:0%
not suggesting that it should be 200t
 
01:37:27.470 --> 01:37:27.480 align:start position:0%
might need to so also understand
 
01:37:29.350 --> 01:37:29.360 align:start position:0%
municipalities would have the right of
 
01:37:30.950 --> 01:37:30.960 align:start position:0%
the zoning organes to change it within
 
01:37:33.229 --> 01:37:33.239 align:start position:0%
their own zoning and cultural needs so
 
01:37:36.030 --> 01:37:36.040 align:start position:0%
again Isa e and samon we have the state
 
01:37:39.189 --> 01:37:39.199 align:start position:0%
of wetland setback and we've chosen to
 
01:37:41.030 --> 01:37:41.040 align:start position:0%
increase our Wetland setback beyond what
 
01:37:42.750 --> 01:37:42.760 align:start position:0%
the state minimum requirement is because
 
01:37:45.750 --> 01:37:45.760 align:start position:0%
we protect our Watershed even more so
 
01:37:47.950 --> 01:37:47.960 align:start position:0%
municipalities would always have the
 
01:37:50.430 --> 01:37:50.440 align:start position:0%
right to do zoning ordinances that were
 
01:37:52.589 --> 01:37:52.599 align:start position:0%
beyond the restriction of the state if
 
01:37:54.070 --> 01:37:54.080 align:start position:0%
they chose to if they wanted to allow it
 
01:37:55.390 --> 01:37:55.400 align:start position:0%
but there's Zing one says you can only
 
01:37:57.669 --> 01:37:57.679 align:start position:0%
do it within 500 ft of a school they
 
01:37:58.950 --> 01:37:58.960 align:start position:0%
could choose to do that but the question
 
01:38:01.470 --> 01:38:01.480 align:start position:0%
is as a state do we want to set a
 
01:38:04.390 --> 01:38:04.400 align:start position:0%
minimum standard that you can't no town
 
01:38:06.030 --> 01:38:06.040 align:start position:0%
can go below this number you could go
 
01:38:08.470 --> 01:38:08.480 align:start position:0%
above it but you can't go below it
 
01:38:10.550 --> 01:38:10.560 align:start position:0%
that's the question
 
01:38:13.229 --> 01:38:13.239 align:start position:0%
Frank um I agree with trying to figure
 
01:38:15.430 --> 01:38:15.440 align:start position:0%
out a I mean I think functionally this
 
01:38:17.550 --> 01:38:17.560 align:start position:0%
this would put many many municipalities
 
01:38:19.910 --> 01:38:19.920 align:start position:0%
out of the option so I as you mentioned
 
01:38:21.870 --> 01:38:21.880 align:start position:0%
there's already an not only
 
01:38:24.790 --> 01:38:24.800 align:start position:0%
um um um control that municipalities
 
01:38:25.669 --> 01:38:25.679 align:start position:0%
would have but they're also going to
 
01:38:27.350 --> 01:38:27.360 align:start position:0%
have to opt in so they're going to have
 
01:38:29.310 --> 01:38:29.320 align:start position:0%
to you know affirmatively say yes we
 
01:38:31.430 --> 01:38:31.440 align:start position:0%
want this in our town so there's
 
01:38:33.350 --> 01:38:33.360 align:start position:0%
multiple ways if a town has concerns for
 
01:38:35.910 --> 01:38:35.920 align:start position:0%
them to not let this happen in their
 
01:38:37.870 --> 01:38:37.880 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction um so I think just from a
 
01:38:39.430 --> 01:38:39.440 align:start position:0%
practical perspective I think mirroring
 
01:38:41.430 --> 01:38:41.440 align:start position:0%
it on you know what what L mentioned
 
01:38:44.189 --> 01:38:44.199 align:start position:0%
makes more sense so my recommendation
 
01:38:46.990 --> 01:38:47.000 align:start position:0%
would be is that we leave the the first
 
01:38:48.550 --> 01:38:48.560 align:start position:0%
everything to the common no cannabis of
 
01:38:50.470 --> 01:38:50.480 align:start position:0%
sou shall operate and then incorporate
 
01:38:53.430 --> 01:38:53.440 align:start position:0%
177 71 which is the 200 ft Church
 
01:38:55.870 --> 01:38:55.880 align:start position:0%
schools and everything else that that is
 
01:38:58.470 --> 01:38:58.480 align:start position:0%
in that so again remember the same group
 
01:39:00.109 --> 01:39:00.119 align:start position:0%
of officers are going to be enforcement
 
01:39:02.030 --> 01:39:02.040 align:start position:0%
so having as much consistent enforcement
 
01:39:03.709 --> 01:39:03.719 align:start position:0%
is going to be important so we'll
 
01:39:05.870 --> 01:39:05.880 align:start position:0%
reference we'll copy the language from
 
01:39:08.030 --> 01:39:08.040 align:start position:0%
that other chapter and put that in here
 
01:39:11.589 --> 01:39:11.599 align:start position:0%
as the minimum standard and then allow
 
01:39:13.390 --> 01:39:13.400 align:start position:0%
towns to establish greater standards if
 
01:39:14.950 --> 01:39:14.960 align:start position:0%
they want to beyond the minimum standard
 
01:39:17.550 --> 01:39:17.560 align:start position:0%
of the state that sound reasonable
 
01:39:20.870 --> 01:39:20.880 align:start position:0%
everybody no I I don't like the I don't
 
01:39:20.880 --> 01:39:22.910 align:start position:0%
everybody no I I don't like the I don't
like

01:39:22.910 --> 01:39:22.920 align:start position:0%
like
 
01:39:30.149 --> 01:39:30.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:32.390 --> 01:39:32.400 align:start position:0%
right all right lawful operation of
 
01:39:32.400 --> 01:39:41.950 align:start position:0%
right all right lawful operation of
cannabis

01:39:41.950 --> 01:39:41.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:44.550 --> 01:39:44.560 align:start position:0%
facilities Mr chair just uh and
 
01:39:46.950 --> 01:39:46.960 align:start position:0%
addressing the potential loophole here
 
01:39:51.950 --> 01:39:51.960 align:start position:0%
for Black Market under uh
 
01:39:54.830 --> 01:39:54.840 align:start position:0%
subparagraph small
 
01:39:58.070 --> 01:39:58.080 align:start position:0%
a uh perhaps uh to tighten this up it
 
01:39:59.550 --> 01:39:59.560 align:start position:0%
should read possessing displaying
 
01:40:01.270 --> 01:40:01.280 align:start position:0%
transporting cannabis or cannabis
 
01:40:03.109 --> 01:40:03.119 align:start position:0%
products that are cultivated
 
01:40:05.910 --> 01:40:05.920 align:start position:0%
manufactured sold pursuant to this
 
01:40:08.310 --> 01:40:08.320 align:start position:0%
chapter uh that makes it clear that it
 
01:40:10.629 --> 01:40:10.639 align:start position:0%
separates it from anyone who's doing it
 
01:40:13.390 --> 01:40:13.400 align:start position:0%
otherwise inconsistent with the chapter
 
01:40:14.669 --> 01:40:14.679 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry where where do what do you
 
01:40:18.390 --> 01:40:18.400 align:start position:0%
want to change um uh write uh small a
 
01:40:21.070 --> 01:40:21.080 align:start position:0%
yeah first line possessing displaying
 
01:40:22.790 --> 01:40:22.800 align:start position:0%
transporting cannabis or cannabis
 
01:40:24.910 --> 01:40:24.920 align:start position:0%
products and then add that are
 
01:40:27.229 --> 01:40:27.239 align:start position:0%
cultivated manufactured or sold pursuant
 
01:40:31.390 --> 01:40:31.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:33.430 --> 01:40:33.440 align:start position:0%
chapter that makes it clear that there's
 
01:40:36.830 --> 01:40:36.840 align:start position:0%
a distinction between um cannabis
 
01:40:39.910 --> 01:40:39.920 align:start position:0%
products that are not being transported
 
01:40:41.350 --> 01:40:41.360 align:start position:0%
sold or produced pursuant to this
 
01:40:43.990 --> 01:40:44.000 align:start position:0%
chapter which are obviously tracked and
 
01:40:47.589 --> 01:40:47.599 align:start position:0%
uh part of the process from that which
 
01:40:59.550 --> 01:40:59.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:01.270 --> 01:41:01.280 align:start position:0%
or to shorten it up you could simply say
 
01:41:05.950 --> 01:41:05.960 align:start position:0%
cannabis products um uh sold pursuant to
 
01:41:05.960 --> 01:41:06.790 align:start position:0%
cannabis products um uh sold pursuant to
this

01:41:06.790 --> 01:41:06.800 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:41:12.229 --> 01:41:12.239 align:start position:0%
chapter so this is relative to
 
01:41:15.310 --> 01:41:15.320 align:start position:0%
lenses right and it's just saying that
 
01:41:18.229 --> 01:41:18.239 align:start position:0%
it's not illegal if you're a lcy to do
 
01:41:20.950 --> 01:41:20.960 align:start position:0%
these things well if you go to number
 
01:41:23.070 --> 01:41:23.080 align:start position:0%
one it says if undertaken by a person 21
 
01:41:25.109 --> 01:41:25.119 align:start position:0%
years of age or older doesn't reflect
 
01:41:29.550 --> 01:41:29.560 align:start position:0%
lense a uh shall not be
 
01:41:31.870 --> 01:41:31.880 align:start position:0%
illegal uh for the basis of seizure
 
01:41:34.669 --> 01:41:34.679 align:start position:0%
forfeiture under New Hampshire law
 
01:41:36.350 --> 01:41:36.360 align:start position:0%
possessing displaying or transporting
 
01:41:36.360 --> 01:41:37.189 align:start position:0%
possessing displaying or transporting
well

01:41:37.189 --> 01:41:37.199 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:41:39.910 --> 01:41:39.920 align:start position:0%
essentially uh what we want to do here
 
01:41:43.350 --> 01:41:43.360 align:start position:0%
is make sure that there's not a loophole
 
01:41:45.629 --> 01:41:45.639 align:start position:0%
for illicit Market by simply making
 
01:41:48.149 --> 01:41:48.159 align:start position:0%
making sure that you're referencing that
 
01:41:49.830 --> 01:41:49.840 align:start position:0%
those products sold pursuant to the
 
01:41:49.840 --> 01:41:51.550 align:start position:0%
those products sold pursuant to the
chapter

01:41:51.550 --> 01:41:51.560 align:start position:0%
chapter
 
01:41:55.390 --> 01:41:55.400 align:start position:0%
Mr chair so if
 
01:41:59.189 --> 01:41:59.199 align:start position:0%
I so again I think Chief the if you go
 
01:42:01.990 --> 01:42:02.000 align:start position:0%
down to line 37 on the page right so
 
01:42:04.229 --> 01:42:04.239 align:start position:0%
everything you start off with a with a
 
01:42:06.790 --> 01:42:06.800 align:start position:0%
list right was saying it shall not be
 
01:42:09.310 --> 01:42:09.320 align:start position:0%
legal for the following we have a list
 
01:42:13.430 --> 01:42:13.440 align:start position:0%
of of events um but we're talking about
 
01:42:17.270 --> 01:42:17.280 align:start position:0%
again two a to a testing facility from a
 
01:42:19.589 --> 01:42:19.599 align:start position:0%
cannabis product manufacturing
 
01:42:22.990 --> 01:42:23.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:25.189 --> 01:42:25.199 align:start position:0%
um so I'm trying to understand where you
 
01:42:27.109 --> 01:42:27.119 align:start position:0%
think a loophole is well I'm just making
 
01:42:28.669 --> 01:42:28.679 align:start position:0%
sure that you have tight language here
 
01:42:30.229 --> 01:42:30.239 align:start position:0%
and when it comes to Prosecuting people
 
01:42:32.470 --> 01:42:32.480 align:start position:0%
or stalking people from a practical
 
01:42:35.270 --> 01:42:35.280 align:start position:0%
standpoint on the road right uh or
 
01:42:38.189 --> 01:42:38.199 align:start position:0%
litigating a case um and again we have
 
01:42:39.270 --> 01:42:39.280 align:start position:0%
attorneys here from the Attorney
 
01:42:41.189 --> 01:42:41.199 align:start position:0%
General's office they may disagree but I
 
01:42:42.870 --> 01:42:42.880 align:start position:0%
think language here that simply says
 
01:42:45.109 --> 01:42:45.119 align:start position:0%
that you're referring to products made
 
01:42:47.390 --> 01:42:47.400 align:start position:0%
uh sold under this chapter makes it very
 
01:42:49.870 --> 01:42:49.880 align:start position:0%
clear what you're talking about it
 
01:42:56.750 --> 01:42:56.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:59.390 --> 01:42:59.400 align:start position:0%
Mr chair y I think I understand where
 
01:43:01.950 --> 01:43:01.960 align:start position:0%
the chief's coming he wants to have when
 
01:43:05.070 --> 01:43:05.080 align:start position:0%
he goes to court an ability to say this
 
01:43:07.750 --> 01:43:07.760 align:start position:0%
person was acting illegally because he
 
01:43:11.070 --> 01:43:11.080 align:start position:0%
had a non-licensed product and the only
 
01:43:14.510 --> 01:43:14.520 align:start position:0%
way and only methodology of doing that
 
01:43:17.629 --> 01:43:17.639 align:start position:0%
is to put into the law that only New
 
01:43:17.639 --> 01:43:19.149 align:start position:0%
is to put into the law that only New
Hampshire

01:43:19.149 --> 01:43:19.159 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
01:43:23.189 --> 01:43:23.199 align:start position:0%
lenses are subject to this because
 
01:43:24.990 --> 01:43:25.000 align:start position:0%
reading this and I agree with the chief
 
01:43:27.229 --> 01:43:27.239 align:start position:0%
reading this I could
 
01:43:32.109 --> 01:43:32.119 align:start position:0%
have I'm over 21 by more than one
 
01:43:32.119 --> 01:43:34.189 align:start position:0%
have I'm over 21 by more than one
day

01:43:34.189 --> 01:43:34.199 align:start position:0%
day
 
01:43:38.070 --> 01:43:38.080 align:start position:0%
marijuana grab it and sell it under this
 
01:43:40.310 --> 01:43:40.320 align:start position:0%
chapter because it says it's not
 
01:43:42.669 --> 01:43:42.679 align:start position:0%
illegal even though I'm not
 
01:43:44.629 --> 01:43:44.639 align:start position:0%
licensed to do
 
01:43:47.950 --> 01:43:47.960 align:start position:0%
so so you need to make somewhere in
 
01:43:49.669 --> 01:43:49.679 align:start position:0%
there that this
 
01:43:53.790 --> 01:43:53.800 align:start position:0%
is Deals Only with New Hampshire lenses
 
01:43:56.430 --> 01:43:56.440 align:start position:0%
and it's a belt and suspenders type of
 
01:43:58.310 --> 01:43:58.320 align:start position:0%
activity but it certainly makes it
 
01:44:02.669 --> 01:44:02.679 align:start position:0%
easier for the chief or any of the uh
 
01:44:05.950 --> 01:44:05.960 align:start position:0%
Leos here to so Joe are you following
 
01:44:07.790 --> 01:44:07.800 align:start position:0%
this because I'm I'm honestly I'm not
 
01:44:09.149 --> 01:44:09.159 align:start position:0%
quite following the loophole they're
 
01:44:11.030 --> 01:44:11.040 align:start position:0%
thinking about but if you're following
 
01:44:12.510 --> 01:44:12.520 align:start position:0%
it would you propose language that
 
01:44:14.030 --> 01:44:14.040 align:start position:0%
closes whatever perceived loophole
 
01:44:15.270 --> 01:44:15.280 align:start position:0%
they're looking at
 
01:44:19.589 --> 01:44:19.599 align:start position:0%
here oh I think we could on line
 
01:44:22.629 --> 01:44:22.639 align:start position:0%
37 we could add
 
01:44:25.830 --> 01:44:25.840 align:start position:0%
licensed from a licensed cannabis
 
01:44:25.840 --> 01:44:26.870 align:start position:0%
licensed from a licensed cannabis
product

01:44:26.870 --> 01:44:26.880 align:start position:0%
product
 
01:44:30.910 --> 01:44:30.920 align:start position:0%
manufacturing facility or sale delivery
 
01:44:34.550 --> 01:44:34.560 align:start position:0%
so licensed cannabis it falls under the
 
01:44:38.109 --> 01:44:38.119 align:start position:0%
The Heading lawful operation of cannabis
 
01:44:40.910 --> 01:44:40.920 align:start position:0%
related facilities but if you wanted to
 
01:44:43.990 --> 01:44:44.000 align:start position:0%
fur further clarify it in line 37 you
 
01:44:49.550 --> 01:44:49.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:49.560 --> 01:44:51.750 align:start position:0%
 
cannabis

01:44:51.750 --> 01:44:51.760 align:start position:0%
cannabis
 
01:44:53.030 --> 01:44:53.040 align:start position:0%
going do the same thing in front of the
 
01:44:54.830 --> 01:44:54.840 align:start position:0%
Cannabis testing facility a licensed
 
01:45:00.550 --> 01:45:00.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:08.990 --> 01:45:09.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:12.030 --> 01:45:12.040 align:start position:0%
cultivator but probably also or license
 
01:45:14.950 --> 01:45:14.960 align:start position:0%
sale delivery or distribution gabis or
 
01:45:17.109 --> 01:45:17.119 align:start position:0%
cannabis products to an adult who is 21
 
01:45:18.910 --> 01:45:18.920 align:start position:0%
years of
 
01:45:21.669 --> 01:45:21.679 align:start position:0%
old that that's where I think that's
 
01:45:25.669 --> 01:45:25.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:28.149 --> 01:45:28.159 align:start position:0%
about so I think that I think the what
 
01:45:30.310 --> 01:45:30.320 align:start position:0%
they're really trying to get at is if if
 
01:45:32.589 --> 01:45:32.599 align:start position:0%
I'm a transporter or cultivator and I'm
 
01:45:34.430 --> 01:45:34.440 align:start position:0%
moving product to a manufacturer I'm
 
01:45:36.550 --> 01:45:36.560 align:start position:0%
going to be above the 2 ounce 4 ounce
 
01:45:38.790 --> 01:45:38.800 align:start position:0%
model limit we have and that's not
 
01:45:40.870 --> 01:45:40.880 align:start position:0%
illegal if I'm conducting it in the form
 
01:45:42.910 --> 01:45:42.920 align:start position:0%
of business is what we're trying to say
 
01:45:44.149 --> 01:45:44.159 align:start position:0%
I think that's what this chapter is
 
01:45:47.270 --> 01:45:47.280 align:start position:0%
trying to say is that you're not subject
 
01:45:49.030 --> 01:45:49.040 align:start position:0%
to the same 2 ooun or 4 ounce
 
01:45:52.149 --> 01:45:52.159 align:start position:0%
restriction whatever it is
 
01:45:54.750 --> 01:45:54.760 align:start position:0%
okay all right look at that we could add
 
01:45:58.790 --> 01:45:58.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:01.709 --> 01:46:01.719 align:start position:0%
there it's one of those one of those
 
01:46:03.550 --> 01:46:03.560 align:start position:0%
legal sentences that go on forever and
 
01:46:04.550 --> 01:46:04.560 align:start position:0%
you're trying to understand what it
 
01:46:06.109 --> 01:46:06.119 align:start position:0%
means because they got so much precursor
 
01:46:06.119 --> 01:46:06.910 align:start position:0%
means because they got so much precursor
to

01:46:06.910 --> 01:46:06.920 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:46:09.629 --> 01:46:09.639 align:start position:0%
it but actually Mr chairman you could
 
01:46:11.950 --> 01:46:11.960 align:start position:0%
add it to The Heading lawful operation
 
01:46:15.430 --> 01:46:15.440 align:start position:0%
of licensed cannabis retail facilities
 
01:46:16.910 --> 01:46:16.920 align:start position:0%
put it in the heading and then it would
 
01:46:19.149 --> 01:46:19.159 align:start position:0%
include everything would have to be
 
01:46:25.270 --> 01:46:25.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:26.870 --> 01:46:26.880 align:start position:0%
so just thinking of the statutory
 
01:46:29.109 --> 01:46:29.119 align:start position:0%
construction here the the title appears
 
01:46:31.229 --> 01:46:31.239 align:start position:0%
to refer to to cannabis related
 
01:46:35.149 --> 01:46:35.159 align:start position:0%
facilities then the the prohibition or
 
01:46:37.109 --> 01:46:37.119 align:start position:0%
the designation that certain acts shall
 
01:46:40.270 --> 01:46:40.280 align:start position:0%
not be illegal doesn't specify that as
 
01:46:41.950 --> 01:46:41.960 align:start position:0%
well and then there's the list of
 
01:46:44.669 --> 01:46:44.679 align:start position:0%
different uh types of conduct or
 
01:46:47.470 --> 01:46:47.480 align:start position:0%
activities that would not be illegal so
 
01:46:49.390 --> 01:46:49.400 align:start position:0%
I if I'm understanding the chief's
 
01:46:52.629 --> 01:46:52.639 align:start position:0%
concern one of those the first one um
 
01:46:53.709 --> 01:46:53.719 align:start position:0%
and all of these would be different
 
01:46:55.390 --> 01:46:55.400 align:start position:0%
Clauses separated by the semicolons
 
01:46:57.270 --> 01:46:57.280 align:start position:0%
would be simply possessing displaying or
 
01:46:58.709 --> 01:46:58.719 align:start position:0%
transporting cannabis or cannabis
 
01:47:02.109 --> 01:47:02.119 align:start position:0%
products and there isn't any language
 
01:47:03.950 --> 01:47:03.960 align:start position:0%
necessarily here that would be
 
01:47:06.070 --> 01:47:06.080 align:start position:0%
prohibiting that independent of a
 
01:47:07.750 --> 01:47:07.760 align:start position:0%
cannabis related facility the title
 
01:47:11.189 --> 01:47:11.199 align:start position:0%
refers to cannabis related facility but
 
01:47:13.070 --> 01:47:13.080 align:start position:0%
the the statutory language itself would
 
01:47:15.550 --> 01:47:15.560 align:start position:0%
say anybody 21 years or older it shall
 
01:47:17.550 --> 01:47:17.560 align:start position:0%
not be illegal to possess display or
 
01:47:19.270 --> 01:47:19.280 align:start position:0%
transport cannabis or cannabis products
 
01:47:23.550 --> 01:47:23.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:25.510 --> 01:47:25.520 align:start position:0%
I think that that the chief's concern
 
01:47:27.270 --> 01:47:27.280 align:start position:0%
would be that doesn't exclude the
 
01:47:31.109 --> 01:47:31.119 align:start position:0%
possibility of black market products
 
01:47:34.990 --> 01:47:35.000 align:start position:0%
being being included as as not illegal
 
01:47:38.070 --> 01:47:38.080 align:start position:0%
under this section so trying to insert
 
01:47:40.790 --> 01:47:40.800 align:start position:0%
language uh that would clarify that
 
01:47:43.750 --> 01:47:43.760 align:start position:0%
products are operation consistent with
 
01:47:43.760 --> 01:47:44.550 align:start position:0%
products are operation consistent with
uh

01:47:44.550 --> 01:47:44.560 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:47:48.990 --> 01:47:49.000 align:start position:0%
this uh this this title would be would
 
01:47:51.950 --> 01:47:51.960 align:start position:0%
not be illegal but operation outside of
 
01:47:53.990 --> 01:47:54.000 align:start position:0%
of the title would be
 
01:47:56.030 --> 01:47:56.040 align:start position:0%
illegal if I'm understanding that the
 
01:47:58.870 --> 01:47:58.880 align:start position:0%
chief's concern so Joe I'm going to ask
 
01:48:00.750 --> 01:48:00.760 align:start position:0%
you to go review this see if we can
 
01:48:01.910 --> 01:48:01.920 align:start position:0%
tighten it up and make it a little
 
01:48:03.390 --> 01:48:03.400 align:start position:0%
cleaner language there's way too many
 
01:48:05.470 --> 01:48:05.480 align:start position:0%
semicolons to try to understand the list
 
01:48:07.830 --> 01:48:07.840 align:start position:0%
of of what we're doing I think again the
 
01:48:11.470 --> 01:48:11.480 align:start position:0%
clear answer is that in operation of a
 
01:48:14.470 --> 01:48:14.480 align:start position:0%
licensed facility the following act
 
01:48:17.830 --> 01:48:17.840 align:start position:0%
shall not be you know illegal right for
 
01:48:20.350 --> 01:48:20.360 align:start position:0%
a person 21 or older and it's it might
 
01:48:21.510 --> 01:48:21.520 align:start position:0%
be an easier way of saying it than
 
01:48:22.709 --> 01:48:22.719 align:start position:0%
trying what we're doing here we're
 
01:48:24.109 --> 01:48:24.119 align:start position:0%
breaking up in all kinds of different
 
01:48:27.270 --> 01:48:27.280 align:start position:0%
sections so um well let's skip that
 
01:48:28.950 --> 01:48:28.960 align:start position:0%
section and come back after the chief
 
01:48:32.589 --> 01:48:32.599 align:start position:0%
reviews it taking in what we said
 
01:48:35.750 --> 01:48:35.760 align:start position:0%
um about about um the lawful operation
 
01:48:38.149 --> 01:48:38.159 align:start position:0%
again so just rewrite that section and
 
01:48:39.470 --> 01:48:39.480 align:start position:0%
maybe tighten it up so it's a little
 
01:48:41.390 --> 01:48:41.400 align:start position:0%
cleaner in understanding so we don't
 
01:48:43.510 --> 01:48:43.520 align:start position:0%
have Miss the statutory construction I
 
01:48:45.629 --> 01:48:45.639 align:start position:0%
just said it's
 
01:48:49.149 --> 01:48:49.159 align:start position:0%
better we just we're skipping over um 21
 
01:48:54.750 --> 01:48:54.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:58.189 --> 01:48:58.199 align:start position:0%
22 all right proof of purchase identity
 
01:48:58.199 --> 01:49:00.149 align:start position:0%
22 all right proof of purchase identity
purchaser's

01:49:00.149 --> 01:49:00.159 align:start position:0%
purchaser's
 
01:49:00.159 --> 01:49:04.470 align:start position:0%
purchaser's
identity

01:49:04.470 --> 01:49:04.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:07.629 --> 01:49:07.639 align:start position:0%
um so again this is interesting as we
 
01:49:08.910 --> 01:49:08.920 align:start position:0%
have a different standard than we just
 
01:49:10.189 --> 01:49:10.199 align:start position:0%
used in the other one about government
 
01:49:12.430 --> 01:49:12.440 align:start position:0%
ID so we probably want to clean that up
 
01:49:17.629 --> 01:49:17.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:21.790 --> 01:49:21.800 align:start position:0%
um this is again what's required for a
 
01:49:23.990 --> 01:49:24.000 align:start position:0%
per person purchasing cannabis from a
 
01:49:25.350 --> 01:49:25.360 align:start position:0%
franchise location what they're
 
01:49:28.310 --> 01:49:28.320 align:start position:0%
obligated to show upon request so the
 
01:49:30.790 --> 01:49:30.800 align:start position:0%
first one is a list you know your ID
 
01:49:33.470 --> 01:49:33.480 align:start position:0%
whether it's driver's license military
 
01:49:37.270 --> 01:49:37.280 align:start position:0%
card um passport whatever right um You
 
01:49:39.189 --> 01:49:39.199 align:start position:0%
have to upon have upon request you have
 
01:49:48.390 --> 01:49:48.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:51.109 --> 01:49:51.119 align:start position:0%
um second one is it's got to have an
 
01:49:55.870 --> 01:49:55.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:01.510 --> 01:50:01.520 align:start position:0%
it Mr chair yes uh if I could ask um The
 
01:50:03.310 --> 01:50:03.320 align:start position:0%
Liquor Commission you already have a
 
01:50:06.189 --> 01:50:06.199 align:start position:0%
standard for uh buying
 
01:50:08.589 --> 01:50:08.599 align:start position:0%
alcohol could we not just apply that
 
01:50:10.790 --> 01:50:10.800 align:start position:0%
here instead of repeating a second set
 
01:50:10.800 --> 01:50:11.669 align:start position:0%
here instead of repeating a second set
of

01:50:11.669 --> 01:50:11.679 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:50:11.679 --> 01:50:19.030 align:start position:0%
of
language

01:50:19.030 --> 01:50:19.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:22.109 --> 01:50:22.119 align:start position:0%
certainly so do we just so the question
 
01:50:24.030 --> 01:50:24.040 align:start position:0%
is do you have I I don't know where that
 
01:50:27.270 --> 01:50:27.280 align:start position:0%
is in law um but if it's in law we can
 
01:50:29.589 --> 01:50:29.599 align:start position:0%
just maybe just reference shall be
 
01:50:31.669 --> 01:50:31.679 align:start position:0%
subject to and reference the other RSA
 
01:50:34.470 --> 01:50:34.480 align:start position:0%
again so we have one consistent standard
 
01:50:36.790 --> 01:50:36.800 align:start position:0%
for purchasing alcohol or cannabis above
 
01:50:38.589 --> 01:50:38.599 align:start position:0%
the age of
 
01:50:41.189 --> 01:50:41.199 align:start position:0%
21 yeah I think and that would also make
 
01:50:43.750 --> 01:50:43.760 align:start position:0%
it uh uh from a law enforcement point of
 
01:50:48.430 --> 01:50:48.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:51.430 --> 01:50:51.440 align:start position:0%
simpler right so we're going to leave
 
01:50:52.830 --> 01:50:52.840 align:start position:0%
that one alone the chief will come back
 
01:50:54.350 --> 01:50:54.360 align:start position:0%
with the homework assignment to what
 
01:50:55.870 --> 01:50:55.880 align:start position:0%
language he wants to change to make it
 
01:50:57.790 --> 01:50:57.800 align:start position:0%
consistent with the liquor laws for
 
01:50:59.470 --> 01:50:59.480 align:start position:0%
purchasing liquor improve of identific
 
01:51:02.510 --> 01:51:02.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:07.109 --> 01:51:07.119 align:start position:0%
that all right um enforcement activity
 
01:51:07.119 --> 01:51:11.510 align:start position:0%
that all right um enforcement activity
verifying

01:51:11.510 --> 01:51:11.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:11.520 --> 01:51:14.430 align:start position:0%
 
non-compliance

01:51:14.430 --> 01:51:14.440 align:start position:0%
non-compliance
 
01:51:17.149 --> 01:51:17.159 align:start position:0%
um it shall be a violation to sell any
 
01:51:18.950 --> 01:51:18.960 align:start position:0%
cannabis cannabis product or cannabis
 
01:51:21.149 --> 01:51:21.159 align:start position:0%
paraphernalia two of mine are during
 
01:51:22.870 --> 01:51:22.880 align:start position:0%
enforcement activity initiated solely
 
01:51:24.669 --> 01:51:24.679 align:start position:0%
for the purpose of verifying
 
01:51:27.149 --> 01:51:27.159 align:start position:0%
non-compliance so again Chief are we
 
01:51:30.910 --> 01:51:30.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:33.229 --> 01:51:33.239 align:start position:0%
here solely for the purpose of a
 
01:51:33.239 --> 01:51:34.350 align:start position:0%
here solely for the purpose of a
verifying

01:51:34.350 --> 01:51:34.360 align:start position:0%
verifying
 
01:51:36.109 --> 01:51:36.119 align:start position:0%
non-compliance that sounds like we're
 
01:51:38.870 --> 01:51:38.880 align:start position:0%
doing a buy attempted buy for someone
 
01:51:41.870 --> 01:51:41.880 align:start position:0%
under 21 or something on a retail at a
 
01:51:43.750 --> 01:51:43.760 align:start position:0%
there just like we do alcohol now we do
 
01:51:46.990 --> 01:51:47.000 align:start position:0%
that with liquor now to retail stores
 
01:51:48.950 --> 01:51:48.960 align:start position:0%
with for
 
01:51:48.960 --> 01:51:52.350 align:start position:0%
with for
beer

01:51:52.350 --> 01:51:52.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:55.270 --> 01:51:55.280 align:start position:0%
yeah Mr chair if if it's re if it points
 
01:51:59.910 --> 01:51:59.920 align:start position:0%
only to the sale at a uh licensed retail
 
01:52:02.870 --> 01:52:02.880 align:start position:0%
outlet that's one thing but if if it has
 
01:52:04.470 --> 01:52:04.480 align:start position:0%
a more broader
 
01:52:07.310 --> 01:52:07.320 align:start position:0%
implication right with respect to sale
 
01:52:10.510 --> 01:52:10.520 align:start position:0%
of miners our recommendation is that if
 
01:52:12.510 --> 01:52:12.520 align:start position:0%
the state is going to legalize
 
01:52:15.189 --> 01:52:15.199 align:start position:0%
commercialize cannabis that any sale to
 
01:52:18.189 --> 01:52:18.199 align:start position:0%
a minor of any cannabis product should
 
01:52:20.510 --> 01:52:20.520 align:start position:0%
be a criminal offense we're talking
 
01:52:23.510 --> 01:52:23.520 align:start position:0%
about a second violation for smoking in
 
01:52:25.350 --> 01:52:25.360 align:start position:0%
public being a criminal defense that any
 
01:52:27.430 --> 01:52:27.440 align:start position:0%
sale of a minor under
 
01:52:30.229 --> 01:52:30.239 align:start position:0%
21 should be a criminal offense uh
 
01:52:33.229 --> 01:52:33.239 align:start position:0%
simply because uh of
 
01:52:36.709 --> 01:52:36.719 align:start position:0%
the substantial health risk imposed to
 
01:52:40.790 --> 01:52:40.800 align:start position:0%
young people here um and the evidence is
 
01:52:43.589 --> 01:52:43.599 align:start position:0%
clear in that regard and we need to have
 
01:52:43.599 --> 01:52:44.750 align:start position:0%
clear in that regard and we need to have
stri

01:52:44.750 --> 01:52:44.760 align:start position:0%
stri
 
01:52:47.149 --> 01:52:47.159 align:start position:0%
penalties um enhanced penalties with
 
01:52:50.270 --> 01:52:50.280 align:start position:0%
respect to sale or distribution to a
 
01:52:52.910 --> 01:52:52.920 align:start position:0%
minor so if I'm if I'm reading this
 
01:52:55.030 --> 01:52:55.040 align:start position:0%
right and and with the correct reference
 
01:52:59.109 --> 01:52:59.119 align:start position:0%
to 38 to 318 again this is talking about
 
01:53:01.950 --> 01:53:01.960 align:start position:0%
enforcement on licensed providers right
 
01:53:03.870 --> 01:53:03.880 align:start position:0%
people working within the law but not
 
01:53:06.430 --> 01:53:06.440 align:start position:0%
actually following the law so to speak
 
01:53:08.109 --> 01:53:08.119 align:start position:0%
um that they're licens is sell but they
 
01:53:10.069 --> 01:53:10.079 align:start position:0%
don't check the ID and they sell to a
 
01:53:13.830 --> 01:53:13.840 align:start position:0%
minor right I think other than that if
 
01:53:16.069 --> 01:53:16.079 align:start position:0%
you were a non-licensed then you sold
 
01:53:17.669 --> 01:53:17.679 align:start position:0%
you would be take with possession with
 
01:53:20.109 --> 01:53:20.119 align:start position:0%
intent to sell right you would would be
 
01:53:21.950 --> 01:53:21.960 align:start position:0%
charged on the existing statute it still
 
01:53:23.430 --> 01:53:23.440 align:start position:0%
would make it illegal because you're not
 
01:53:25.069 --> 01:53:25.079 align:start position:0%
a lensee and you're not allowed to sell
 
01:53:27.470 --> 01:53:27.480 align:start position:0%
marijuana unless you're a l so you be
 
01:53:28.709 --> 01:53:28.719 align:start position:0%
you would be under the controlled
 
01:53:31.149 --> 01:53:31.159 align:start position:0%
substance act and be subject to sale and
 
01:53:33.910 --> 01:53:33.920 align:start position:0%
a felony level if you're a non-licensee
 
01:53:33.920 --> 01:53:34.950 align:start position:0%
a felony level if you're a non-licensee
selling

01:53:34.950 --> 01:53:34.960 align:start position:0%
selling
 
01:53:36.990 --> 01:53:37.000 align:start position:0%
marijuana so I don't know that this this
 
01:53:39.830 --> 01:53:39.840 align:start position:0%
is strictly talking about lies who don't
 
01:53:41.589 --> 01:53:41.599 align:start position:0%
comply and sell to an underage minor
 
01:53:44.310 --> 01:53:44.320 align:start position:0%
just like retail stores who sell beer to
 
01:53:46.870 --> 01:53:46.880 align:start position:0%
a a 20-year old right that this is
 
01:53:48.950 --> 01:53:48.960 align:start position:0%
enforcement of those actions and so the
 
01:53:50.270 --> 01:53:50.280 align:start position:0%
question I'm try that's the way I'm
 
01:53:51.510 --> 01:53:51.520 align:start position:0%
reading it Chief it's that the
 
01:53:53.669 --> 01:53:53.679 align:start position:0%
enforcement actions to verify that the
 
01:53:55.270 --> 01:53:55.280 align:start position:0%
lenses are doing what they're supposed
 
01:53:58.310 --> 01:53:58.320 align:start position:0%
to do and certainly if if if F col 17
 
01:54:01.109 --> 01:54:01.119 align:start position:0%
points to Simply sell at a retail outlet
 
01:54:05.310 --> 01:54:05.320 align:start position:0%
uh then I would agree however uh again
 
01:54:08.310 --> 01:54:08.320 align:start position:0%
um it's a violation not a criminal
 
01:54:11.830 --> 01:54:11.840 align:start position:0%
offense to do that uh and perhaps a
 
01:54:13.709 --> 01:54:13.719 align:start position:0%
recommendation to include elsewhere
 
01:54:17.229 --> 01:54:17.239 align:start position:0%
somewhere in the recommending statutory
 
01:54:19.950 --> 01:54:19.960 align:start position:0%
language where appropriate perhaps at
 
01:54:22.669 --> 01:54:22.679 align:start position:0%
this section that any sale or
 
01:54:25.669 --> 01:54:25.679 align:start position:0%
distribution to a minor under 21 would
 
01:54:27.830 --> 01:54:27.840 align:start position:0%
be a criminal
 
01:54:30.069 --> 01:54:30.079 align:start position:0%
offense at least that's a recommendation
 
01:54:31.709 --> 01:54:31.719 align:start position:0%
Senor Whitley yeah so I would agree
 
01:54:33.510 --> 01:54:33.520 align:start position:0%
Senator Lang with your interpretation
 
01:54:36.870 --> 01:54:36.880 align:start position:0%
that this is this section in particular
 
01:54:39.870 --> 01:54:39.880 align:start position:0%
is targeted towards enforcement under
 
01:54:43.069 --> 01:54:43.079 align:start position:0%
this act of the
 
01:54:45.270 --> 01:54:45.280 align:start position:0%
um involving the
 
01:54:48.430 --> 01:54:48.440 align:start position:0%
franchisees uh so we already have
 
01:54:51.750 --> 01:54:51.760 align:start position:0%
existing law on on uh drug related
 
01:54:55.430 --> 01:54:55.440 align:start position:0%
crimes and so I think that law is
 
01:54:56.790 --> 01:54:56.800 align:start position:0%
already there we don't need to change
 
01:54:58.229 --> 01:54:58.239 align:start position:0%
that but I would agree that this is
 
01:55:00.229 --> 01:55:00.239 align:start position:0%
focused on sort of the enforcement
 
01:55:02.030 --> 01:55:02.040 align:start position:0%
within the sort of structure that we're
 
01:55:04.830 --> 01:55:04.840 align:start position:0%
that we're creating so my understanding
 
01:55:07.470 --> 01:55:07.480 align:start position:0%
of of where it's placed is similar to
 
01:55:10.669 --> 01:55:10.679 align:start position:0%
yours so Joe can you explain I'm trying
 
01:55:12.629 --> 01:55:12.639 align:start position:0%
to understand the first sentence and the
 
01:55:13.870 --> 01:55:13.880 align:start position:0%
second sentence and what the difference
 
01:55:18.270 --> 01:55:18.280 align:start position:0%
is between them um one talks about um
 
01:55:20.790 --> 01:55:20.800 align:start position:0%
you know it's a violation
 
01:55:24.550 --> 01:55:24.560 align:start position:0%
um cannabis product to a minor enfor um
 
01:55:26.109 --> 01:55:26.119 align:start position:0%
during enforcement activity initiated
 
01:55:27.629 --> 01:55:27.639 align:start position:0%
solely for the purpose of varing
 
01:55:29.229 --> 01:55:29.239 align:start position:0%
verifying non-compliance so again that's
 
01:55:30.950 --> 01:55:30.960 align:start position:0%
a sting operation as I'm reading that be
 
01:55:34.470 --> 01:55:34.480 align:start position:0%
a violation for a a lensed uh cell to a
 
01:55:37.030 --> 01:55:37.040 align:start position:0%
minor um if you were doing a sting
 
01:55:38.510 --> 01:55:38.520 align:start position:0%
operation the second sentence it shall
 
01:55:40.510 --> 01:55:40.520 align:start position:0%
be a misdemeanor to knowingly sell
 
01:55:43.430 --> 01:55:43.440 align:start position:0%
cannabis or cannabis paraphernalia canab
 
01:55:45.709 --> 01:55:45.719 align:start position:0%
par Canabis paraphernalia to a minor at
 
01:55:47.589 --> 01:55:47.599 align:start position:0%
the time of any such enforcement
 
01:55:49.750 --> 01:55:49.760 align:start position:0%
activity those two sentences seem in
 
01:55:51.870 --> 01:55:51.880 align:start position:0%
conflict with each other one saying it's
 
01:55:53.069 --> 01:55:53.079 align:start position:0%
a violation the other saying it's a
 
01:55:54.350 --> 01:55:54.360 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor but it seems like it's the
 
01:55:57.229 --> 01:55:57.239 align:start position:0%
same exact thing and I don't understand
 
01:55:59.109 --> 01:55:59.119 align:start position:0%
what we're trying to say there can I ask
 
01:56:03.830 --> 01:56:03.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:06.310 --> 01:56:06.320 align:start position:0%
question does the first one not require
 
01:56:08.030 --> 01:56:08.040 align:start position:0%
knowledge just the mere fact like if you
 
01:56:09.990 --> 01:56:10.000 align:start position:0%
took a fake ID and you were real casual
 
01:56:12.390 --> 01:56:12.400 align:start position:0%
by taking fake IDs for the other one the
 
01:56:14.350 --> 01:56:14.360 align:start position:0%
second sentence requires knowledge yeah
 
01:56:15.910 --> 01:56:15.920 align:start position:0%
exactly there's a different intent
 
01:56:17.629 --> 01:56:17.639 align:start position:0%
you're right you're right yep is that is
 
01:56:20.350 --> 01:56:20.360 align:start position:0%
that the interpretation Mr chairman I
 
01:56:23.629 --> 01:56:23.639 align:start position:0%
would ask the chief uh if he's
 
01:56:28.270 --> 01:56:28.280 align:start position:0%
here come up and speak is he
 
01:56:31.589 --> 01:56:31.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:35.149 --> 01:56:35.159 align:start position:0%
there so there's a higher essentially I
 
01:56:37.430 --> 01:56:37.440 align:start position:0%
think C Again State I get it exactly so
 
01:56:39.550 --> 01:56:39.560 align:start position:0%
there's a
 
01:56:42.229 --> 01:56:42.239 align:start position:0%
higher first one's if it's a mistake
 
01:56:45.109 --> 01:56:45.119 align:start position:0%
fake ID oops we didn't do due diligence
 
01:56:48.470 --> 01:56:48.480 align:start position:0%
secondly is we knew we were doing
 
01:56:48.480 --> 01:56:49.990 align:start position:0%
secondly is we knew we were doing
it

01:56:49.990 --> 01:56:50.000 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:56:51.270 --> 01:56:51.280 align:start position:0%
do we want the CH do you want Mark to
 
01:56:53.390 --> 01:56:53.400 align:start position:0%
come over and answer some
 
01:56:56.709 --> 01:56:56.719 align:start position:0%
questions Chief armanian have a seat
 
01:56:57.709 --> 01:56:57.719 align:start position:0%
raise your right hand no I'm just
 
01:56:59.470 --> 01:56:59.480 align:start position:0%
kidding thank you
 
01:57:08.830 --> 01:57:08.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:18.149 --> 01:57:18.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:22.830 --> 01:57:22.840 align:start position:0%
you so Chief we're looking at um page 23
 
01:57:26.950 --> 01:57:26.960 align:start position:0%
section 17 uh 318 f17 and that first
 
01:57:28.470 --> 01:57:28.480 align:start position:0%
sentence in the second sentence and I
 
01:57:30.990 --> 01:57:31.000 align:start position:0%
think we got the answer is one talks
 
01:57:32.629 --> 01:57:32.639 align:start position:0%
about a sting operation I think where
 
01:57:34.310 --> 01:57:34.320 align:start position:0%
you send somebody in with either a fake
 
01:57:36.629 --> 01:57:36.639 align:start position:0%
ID or something like that who who is
 
01:57:39.149 --> 01:57:39.159 align:start position:0%
under 21 and has a fake ID and they
 
01:57:40.830 --> 01:57:40.840 align:start position:0%
still sell to him and not identify the
 
01:57:43.709 --> 01:57:43.719 align:start position:0%
fake ID that would be a violation can
 
01:57:45.709 --> 01:57:45.719 align:start position:0%
can I correct you on that sir go ahead
 
01:57:47.310 --> 01:57:47.320 align:start position:0%
no I appreciate it yeah so we don't do
 
01:57:51.229 --> 01:57:51.239 align:start position:0%
that okay um trickery isn't part of our
 
01:57:55.270 --> 01:57:55.280 align:start position:0%
Mantra um we do use underage buyers with
 
01:57:55.280 --> 01:57:56.790 align:start position:0%
Mantra um we do use underage buyers with
their

01:57:56.790 --> 01:57:56.800 align:start position:0%
their
 
01:57:59.350 --> 01:57:59.360 align:start position:0%
IDs um what we find is people don't
 
01:58:03.629 --> 01:58:03.639 align:start position:0%
check IDs so they look at a real ID of
 
01:58:07.709 --> 01:58:07.719 align:start position:0%
somebody of Youth full age um usually in
 
01:58:10.910 --> 01:58:10.920 align:start position:0%
the area of s 17 years old 16 to 17
 
01:58:14.550 --> 01:58:14.560 align:start position:0%
years old and they don't check the ID
 
01:58:16.910 --> 01:58:16.920 align:start position:0%
there's no fake IDs coming in or
 
01:58:18.830 --> 01:58:18.840 align:start position:0%
anything because actually that would be
 
01:58:21.069 --> 01:58:21.079 align:start position:0%
a ense wouldn't it if somebody had a
 
01:58:23.350 --> 01:58:23.360 align:start position:0%
really good fake ID how would the
 
01:58:26.750 --> 01:58:26.760 align:start position:0%
establishment be liable for a fake ID so
 
01:58:27.870 --> 01:58:27.880 align:start position:0%
so which TR understand the difference
 
01:58:29.430 --> 01:58:29.440 align:start position:0%
between SE the first sentence and the
 
01:58:30.830 --> 01:58:30.840 align:start position:0%
second sentence one's a violation the
 
01:58:32.470 --> 01:58:32.480 align:start position:0%
other one's a misdemeanor we're trying
 
01:58:34.470 --> 01:58:34.480 align:start position:0%
to understand what the difference is why
 
01:58:35.870 --> 01:58:35.880 align:start position:0%
you would charge one is a violation one
 
01:58:37.589 --> 01:58:37.599 align:start position:0%
is a misdemeanor but looks like the same
 
01:58:41.589 --> 01:58:41.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:44.750 --> 01:58:44.760 align:start position:0%
minor except one as a knowing yeah if
 
01:58:46.950 --> 01:58:46.960 align:start position:0%
you look on line
 
01:58:50.030 --> 01:58:50.040 align:start position:0%
six the misdemeanor is for knowingly
 
01:58:50.040 --> 01:58:51.189 align:start position:0%
six the misdemeanor is for knowingly
selling

01:58:51.189 --> 01:58:51.199 align:start position:0%
selling
 
01:58:53.950 --> 01:58:53.960 align:start position:0%
it so it's going toward culpable state
 
01:58:56.950 --> 01:58:56.960 align:start position:0%
of mind right I would have to research
 
01:58:56.960 --> 01:58:58.229 align:start position:0%
of mind right I would have to research
38

01:58:58.229 --> 01:58:58.239 align:start position:0%
38
 
01:59:00.910 --> 01:59:00.920 align:start position:0%
F18 um just to get a better view of that
 
01:59:03.470 --> 01:59:03.480 align:start position:0%
it won't take me long to research it but
 
01:59:05.669 --> 01:59:05.679 align:start position:0%
sorry I'm coming in cold on this right
 
01:59:08.990 --> 01:59:09.000 align:start position:0%
now so we'll leave it as it is unless we
 
01:59:10.750 --> 01:59:10.760 align:start position:0%
have something we come back with
 
01:59:12.350 --> 01:59:12.360 align:start position:0%
something different that explains you
 
01:59:13.669 --> 01:59:13.679 align:start position:0%
know but we'll leave it as it is but CH
 
01:59:15.550 --> 01:59:15.560 align:start position:0%
you can look at it and let us know come
 
01:59:17.629 --> 01:59:17.639 align:start position:0%
back next week and just I or I could do
 
01:59:20.109 --> 01:59:20.119 align:start position:0%
it right now if you just give me
 
01:59:23.470 --> 01:59:23.480 align:start position:0%
to talk about 18 next after this one
 
01:59:26.109 --> 01:59:26.119 align:start position:0%
okay let me just let me just jump out
 
01:59:27.870 --> 01:59:27.880 align:start position:0%
fire it up on the computer and research
 
01:59:29.390 --> 01:59:29.400 align:start position:0%
it and I'll get right back to you so by
 
01:59:30.629 --> 01:59:30.639 align:start position:0%
default we'll leave it alone unless the
 
01:59:31.669 --> 01:59:31.679 align:start position:0%
chief comes back with something
 
01:59:33.189 --> 01:59:33.199 align:start position:0%
different does that sound reasonable to
 
01:59:36.470 --> 01:59:36.480 align:start position:0%
everybody um I did have one question is
 
01:59:38.069 --> 01:59:38.079 align:start position:0%
and I think I'm okay with it because
 
01:59:40.390 --> 01:59:40.400 align:start position:0%
again we don't specify A or B misdem
 
01:59:42.790 --> 01:59:42.800 align:start position:0%
meter and that is multiple offenses
 
01:59:44.790 --> 01:59:44.800 align:start position:0%
where you have a a facility that
 
01:59:47.189 --> 01:59:47.199 align:start position:0%
continually sells and you have license
 
01:59:48.790 --> 01:59:48.800 align:start position:0%
suspension issues and that kind of thing
 
01:59:50.790 --> 01:59:50.800 align:start position:0%
possibly but um the question is on a
 
01:59:52.870 --> 01:59:52.880 align:start position:0%
criminal charge does a second offense
 
01:59:55.669 --> 01:59:55.679 align:start position:0%
have an increased penalty and my argu I
 
01:59:56.910 --> 01:59:56.920 align:start position:0%
guess i' argue the same thing I was
 
01:59:58.030 --> 01:59:58.040 align:start position:0%
talking about consumption if we just
 
01:59:59.510 --> 01:59:59.520 align:start position:0%
leave it as misdemeanor you always have
 
02:00:02.189 --> 02:00:02.199 align:start position:0%
the option of filing it as a a versus a
 
02:00:04.709 --> 02:00:04.719 align:start position:0%
b um if you choose
 
02:00:08.189 --> 02:00:08.199 align:start position:0%
to for a second offense or multiple
 
02:00:11.990 --> 02:00:12.000 align:start position:0%
offenses so I'm okay with it as it's
 
02:00:15.950 --> 02:00:15.960 align:start position:0%
written thanks Chief thank you Senator
 
02:00:21.990 --> 02:00:22.000 align:start position:0%
all right 318b uh 318f um 18 uh driving
 
02:00:24.629 --> 02:00:24.639 align:start position:0%
Miners and and control of
 
02:00:24.639 --> 02:00:26.750 align:start position:0%
Miners and and control of
property

02:00:26.750 --> 02:00:26.760 align:start position:0%
property
 
02:00:29.950 --> 02:00:29.960 align:start position:0%
um I'm sorry may I ask a clarification
 
02:00:31.950 --> 02:00:31.960 align:start position:0%
question so so you're good with the
 
02:00:35.990 --> 02:00:36.000 align:start position:0%
language being as is on in section 17
 
02:00:39.589 --> 02:00:39.599 align:start position:0%
because the uh the misdemeanor can be
 
02:00:41.510 --> 02:00:41.520 align:start position:0%
charged the first time is an a second
 
02:00:42.709 --> 02:00:42.719 align:start position:0%
time is a b something like that well
 
02:00:44.669 --> 02:00:44.679 align:start position:0%
actually would be the yeah first or
 
02:00:46.149 --> 02:00:46.159 align:start position:0%
second or third time could be charges an
 
02:00:48.109 --> 02:00:48.119 align:start position:0%
a right so got it based on the
 
02:00:49.669 --> 02:00:49.679 align:start position:0%
aggravating mitigating so Circumstance
 
02:00:51.709 --> 02:00:51.719 align:start position:0%
the prosecut have discretion
 
02:00:57.109 --> 02:00:57.119 align:start position:0%
y um all right section 18
 
02:00:59.990 --> 02:01:00.000 align:start position:0%
um all of
 
02:01:02.109 --> 02:01:02.119 align:start position:0%
property section one does anybody have
 
02:01:04.390 --> 02:01:04.400 align:start position:0%
any comments on section
 
02:01:07.069 --> 02:01:07.079 align:start position:0%
one Senator just note uh representatives
 
02:01:09.030 --> 02:01:09.040 align:start position:0%
from the Department of Safety are here
 
02:01:11.149 --> 02:01:11.159 align:start position:0%
uh may wish to share commentary on
 
02:01:12.790 --> 02:01:12.800 align:start position:0%
section one sure Lieutenant you want to
 
02:01:18.030 --> 02:01:18.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:18.040 --> 02:01:29.629 align:start position:0%
 
up

02:01:29.629 --> 02:01:29.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:32.149 --> 02:01:32.159 align:start position:0%
so again the first F number one is just
 
02:01:34.790 --> 02:01:34.800 align:start position:0%
saying that nothing in here legalizes
 
02:01:37.030 --> 02:01:37.040 align:start position:0%
driving Under the Influence I that's a
 
02:01:39.550 --> 02:01:39.560 align:start position:0%
pretty clear statement of fact we're
 
02:01:41.510 --> 02:01:41.520 align:start position:0%
good Lieutenant you okay with that
 
02:01:44.470 --> 02:01:44.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:47.589 --> 02:01:47.599 align:start position:0%
sir section two um nothing in this
 
02:01:49.069 --> 02:01:49.079 align:start position:0%
chapter shall be construed to permit the
 
02:01:50.750 --> 02:01:50.760 align:start position:0%
transfer of cannabis with or without
 
02:01:52.990 --> 02:01:53.000 align:start position:0%
renumeration to a person under the age
 
02:01:55.750 --> 02:01:55.760 align:start position:0%
or allow a person uh under the age of 21
 
02:01:57.669 --> 02:01:57.679 align:start position:0%
to possess years again makes it a
 
02:01:59.790 --> 02:01:59.800 align:start position:0%
statement of fact very clear
 
02:02:02.270 --> 02:02:02.280 align:start position:0%
that in under no circumstance can a
 
02:02:04.589 --> 02:02:04.599 align:start position:0%
person of Mone under 21 have have
 
02:02:06.149 --> 02:02:06.159 align:start position:0%
possession of marij one or can you give
 
02:02:07.790 --> 02:02:07.800 align:start position:0%
them possession marij
 
02:02:12.350 --> 02:02:12.360 align:start position:0%
one by Min um number three nothing this
 
02:02:14.069 --> 02:02:14.079 align:start position:0%
chapter shall Pro the state or County
 
02:02:15.750 --> 02:02:15.760 align:start position:0%
Correction Facility from prohibiting The
 
02:02:18.229 --> 02:02:18.239 align:start position:0%
Possession consumption or use display
 
02:02:20.589 --> 02:02:20.599 align:start position:0%
transfer distribution and
 
02:02:23.109 --> 02:02:23.119 align:start position:0%
sale Transportation or growing of
 
02:02:25.709 --> 02:02:25.719 align:start position:0%
cannabis on or in a correctional
 
02:02:29.950 --> 02:02:29.960 align:start position:0%
facility so again I think this um just
 
02:02:31.350 --> 02:02:31.360 align:start position:0%
says that the state has the right to say
 
02:02:33.030 --> 02:02:33.040 align:start position:0%
we don't want any drugs in our jail even
 
02:02:36.109 --> 02:02:36.119 align:start position:0%
if it is legal just like to do
 
02:02:38.550 --> 02:02:38.560 align:start position:0%
alcohol one cool question I apologize on
 
02:02:40.550 --> 02:02:40.560 align:start position:0%
the previous one um and I think this
 
02:02:42.669 --> 02:02:42.679 align:start position:0%
will depend it may depend on how we end
 
02:02:45.830 --> 02:02:45.840 align:start position:0%
up dealing with the medical is under 21
 
02:02:47.790 --> 02:02:47.800 align:start position:0%
with medical
 
02:02:55.870 --> 02:02:55.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:57.950 --> 02:02:57.960 align:start position:0%
uh yeah I don't know the answer to that
 
02:03:00.709 --> 02:03:00.719 align:start position:0%
question is therapeutic
 
02:03:04.510 --> 02:03:04.520 align:start position:0%
18 what is therapeutic any
 
02:03:08.109 --> 02:03:08.119 align:start position:0%
age um so does that mean we have to add
 
02:03:09.910 --> 02:03:09.920 align:start position:0%
accept as provided by
 
02:03:15.069 --> 02:03:15.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:17.430 --> 02:03:17.440 align:start position:0%
yep so but for number one it's
 
02:03:19.430 --> 02:03:19.440 align:start position:0%
irrelevant right so yeah I think just
 
02:03:20.790 --> 02:03:20.800 align:start position:0%
number two number one it's irrelevance
 
02:03:23.350 --> 02:03:23.360 align:start position:0%
only number two right we're talking
 
02:03:26.669 --> 02:03:26.679 align:start position:0%
about except as
 
02:03:29.470 --> 02:03:29.480 align:start position:0%
provided accept is permitted permitted
 
02:03:29.480 --> 02:03:32.030 align:start position:0%
provided accept is permitted permitted
by

02:03:32.030 --> 02:03:32.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:35.870 --> 02:03:35.880 align:start position:0%
Yeah by 126
 
02:03:38.390 --> 02:03:38.400 align:start position:0%
DX impressive that you have that
 
02:03:40.750 --> 02:03:40.760 align:start position:0%
statutory reference at your fingertip
 
02:03:43.589 --> 02:03:43.599 align:start position:0%
sorry talking about marijuana way too
 
02:03:43.599 --> 02:03:45.229 align:start position:0%
sorry talking about marijuana way too
much

02:03:45.229 --> 02:03:45.239 align:start position:0%
much
 
02:03:47.669 --> 02:03:47.679 align:start position:0%
um we're okay with three though jails
 
02:03:53.030 --> 02:03:53.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:57.549 --> 02:03:57.559 align:start position:0%
prohibit um number four accept Prov in
 
02:03:58.830 --> 02:03:58.840 align:start position:0%
the section this chapter does not
 
02:04:00.990 --> 02:04:01.000 align:start position:0%
require any personal operation own
 
02:04:03.709 --> 02:04:03.719 align:start position:0%
controls to allow consumption private
 
02:04:03.719 --> 02:04:17.790 align:start position:0%
controls to allow consumption private
sale

02:04:17.790 --> 02:04:17.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:21.750 --> 02:04:21.760 align:start position:0%
right so again this is talking about uh
 
02:04:24.310 --> 02:04:24.320 align:start position:0%
private property rights right allowing
 
02:04:25.950 --> 02:04:25.960 align:start position:0%
allowing private property owner to
 
02:04:28.870 --> 02:04:28.880 align:start position:0%
restrict if they choose to um the first
 
02:04:31.229 --> 02:04:31.239 align:start position:0%
one is interesting it it allows a
 
02:04:34.189 --> 02:04:34.199 align:start position:0%
landlord if they're only doing Edibles
 
02:04:35.390 --> 02:04:35.400 align:start position:0%
then there should be no reason a
 
02:04:37.390 --> 02:04:37.400 align:start position:0%
landlord should be able to prohibit it
 
02:04:39.189 --> 02:04:39.199 align:start position:0%
but obviously can prohibit smoking like
 
02:04:41.669 --> 02:04:41.679 align:start position:0%
they can now anyway right even you
 
02:04:44.270 --> 02:04:44.280 align:start position:0%
landlords can prohibit make non-smoking
 
02:04:44.280 --> 02:04:47.750 align:start position:0%
landlords can prohibit make non-smoking
rentals

02:04:47.750 --> 02:04:47.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:47.760 --> 02:04:50.589 align:start position:0%
 
so

02:04:50.589 --> 02:04:50.599 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:04:52.950 --> 02:04:52.960 align:start position:0%
yep just to be clear now what you're
 
02:04:56.189 --> 02:04:56.199 align:start position:0%
saying is that even if it is in a zoned
 
02:04:59.549 --> 02:04:59.559 align:start position:0%
area the owner of the property say just
 
02:05:02.270 --> 02:05:02.280 align:start position:0%
picking a name of the solivan Brady or
 
02:05:05.669 --> 02:05:05.679 align:start position:0%
Meg Properties or whatever and say no
 
02:05:07.310 --> 02:05:07.320 align:start position:0%
can say no smoking marijuana in our
 
02:05:09.990 --> 02:05:10.000 align:start position:0%
facilities yes smoking in can they
 
02:05:12.149 --> 02:05:12.159 align:start position:0%
prohibit the sale
 
02:05:12.159 --> 02:05:14.030 align:start position:0%
prohibit the sale
of

02:05:14.030 --> 02:05:14.040 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:05:16.549 --> 02:05:16.559 align:start position:0%
um in theory
 
02:05:19.750 --> 02:05:19.760 align:start position:0%
yes that says consumption doesn't say
 
02:05:21.910 --> 02:05:21.920 align:start position:0%
yeah it does it says sale consumption
 
02:05:24.109 --> 02:05:24.119 align:start position:0%
cultivation displayed so I'm going to
 
02:05:25.910 --> 02:05:25.920 align:start position:0%
use the example of Market Basket right
 
02:05:29.470 --> 02:05:29.480 align:start position:0%
now right so down in Nashua Nash Salem
 
02:05:31.510 --> 02:05:31.520 align:start position:0%
there was a Char gaming operation wanted
 
02:05:33.510 --> 02:05:33.520 align:start position:0%
to go into a market Bas basket owned
 
02:05:34.990 --> 02:05:35.000 align:start position:0%
facility in Market Basket says we don't
 
02:05:36.709 --> 02:05:36.719 align:start position:0%
want that operation in our state they're
 
02:05:38.030 --> 02:05:38.040 align:start position:0%
allowed to do
 
02:05:40.390 --> 02:05:40.400 align:start position:0%
that so this would give them the same
 
02:05:44.149 --> 02:05:44.159 align:start position:0%
right if a if a strip mall owner and
 
02:05:45.390 --> 02:05:45.400 align:start position:0%
someone wants to come in with a retail
 
02:05:46.910 --> 02:05:46.920 align:start position:0%
franchise operation they would have the
 
02:05:49.470 --> 02:05:49.480 align:start position:0%
right to say no yeah I don't want that
 
02:05:51.470 --> 02:05:51.480 align:start position:0%
in my strip M just as long as we're
 
02:05:51.480 --> 02:05:58.069 align:start position:0%
in my strip M just as long as we're
clearing

02:05:58.069 --> 02:05:58.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:01.870 --> 02:06:01.880 align:start position:0%
that is there anything in or we need to
 
02:06:09.430 --> 02:06:09.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:12.589 --> 02:06:12.599 align:start position:0%
about oh
 
02:06:17.589 --> 02:06:17.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:17.599 --> 02:06:27.189 align:start position:0%
 
again

02:06:27.189 --> 02:06:27.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:29.709 --> 02:06:29.719 align:start position:0%
and then C which is under again number
 
02:06:32.629 --> 02:06:32.639 align:start position:0%
four C on this one b
 
02:06:36.069 --> 02:06:36.079 align:start position:0%
b again just restates that a landlord
 
02:06:37.629 --> 02:06:37.639 align:start position:0%
has the right to prohibit smoking or
 
02:06:40.510 --> 02:06:40.520 align:start position:0%
cultivation within his facility um and
 
02:06:43.510 --> 02:06:43.520 align:start position:0%
then uh C is interesting it says that if
 
02:06:44.990 --> 02:06:45.000 align:start position:0%
you're basically visiting somebody that
 
02:06:46.589 --> 02:06:46.599 align:start position:0%
don't they have the right to stop you
 
02:06:49.310 --> 02:06:49.320 align:start position:0%
from smoking in their residents or place
 
02:06:54.189 --> 02:06:54.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:57.510 --> 02:06:57.520 align:start position:0%
to everybody good with that for property
 
02:07:00.310 --> 02:07:00.320 align:start position:0%
rights great let's go on to enforcement
 
02:07:02.069 --> 02:07:02.079 align:start position:0%
of contracts
 
02:07:04.990 --> 02:07:05.000 align:start position:0%
19 um contracts related to the
 
02:07:07.750 --> 02:07:07.760 align:start position:0%
operation I'm sorry just before moving
 
02:07:10.390 --> 02:07:10.400 align:start position:0%
off this section uh just like to go back
 
02:07:13.270 --> 02:07:13.280 align:start position:0%
to subsection one um and I know that we
 
02:07:16.189 --> 02:07:16.199 align:start position:0%
we touched on it that's relating to um
 
02:07:17.750 --> 02:07:17.760 align:start position:0%
nothing shall be construed to permit
 
02:07:21.750 --> 02:07:21.760 align:start position:0%
driving the influence of drugs or liquor
 
02:07:25.109 --> 02:07:25.119 align:start position:0%
um even without changing anything in
 
02:07:30.069 --> 02:07:30.079 align:start position:0%
265a uh would just uh ask if uh
 
02:07:32.750 --> 02:07:32.760 align:start position:0%
the by the operation of this this title
 
02:07:35.470 --> 02:07:35.480 align:start position:0%
and legalization uh just comment from
 
02:07:37.910 --> 02:07:37.920 align:start position:0%
the lieutenant on challenges for
 
02:07:40.790 --> 02:07:40.800 align:start position:0%
enforcement uh related to this as we've
 
02:07:43.510 --> 02:07:43.520 align:start position:0%
had a lot of other discussion related to
 
02:07:46.149 --> 02:07:46.159 align:start position:0%
uh Public Health Public Safety uh and so
 
02:07:48.350 --> 02:07:48.360 align:start position:0%
even though this language is is cursory
 
02:07:50.430 --> 02:07:50.440 align:start position:0%
and saying we're not touching 265a just
 
02:07:52.669 --> 02:07:52.679 align:start position:0%
challenges from other sections of law if
 
02:07:54.870 --> 02:07:54.880 align:start position:0%
we are legalizing or authorizing certain
 
02:07:56.629 --> 02:07:56.639 align:start position:0%
or want to use different locations so we
 
02:07:59.310 --> 02:07:59.320 align:start position:0%
just put that to the lieutenant for uh
 
02:08:01.069 --> 02:08:01.079 align:start position:0%
to ask about uh challenges for
 
02:08:03.229 --> 02:08:03.239 align:start position:0%
enforcement yeah certainly um so
 
02:08:05.270 --> 02:08:05.280 align:start position:0%
obviously if we legalize marijuana here
 
02:08:06.750 --> 02:08:06.760 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire we're going to have um
 
02:08:08.750 --> 02:08:08.760 align:start position:0%
an increase in potential uh impaired
 
02:08:10.030 --> 02:08:10.040 align:start position:0%
driving with this as we've seen
 
02:08:11.709 --> 02:08:11.719 align:start position:0%
throughout the country with the
 
02:08:13.790 --> 02:08:13.800 align:start position:0%
increases of impaired driving with um
 
02:08:16.390 --> 02:08:16.400 align:start position:0%
cannabis related um driving um that
 
02:08:17.950 --> 02:08:17.960 align:start position:0%
being said some of the things and some
 
02:08:19.430 --> 02:08:19.440 align:start position:0%
of the challenges is that um we as the
 
02:08:20.669 --> 02:08:20.679 align:start position:0%
state police are going to see and
 
02:08:21.990 --> 02:08:22.000 align:start position:0%
probably our local partners and our
 
02:08:24.470 --> 02:08:24.480 align:start position:0%
County Partners are going to see is um a
 
02:08:26.669 --> 02:08:26.679 align:start position:0%
training um piece with our with our
 
02:08:28.990 --> 02:08:29.000 align:start position:0%
Troopers officers and deputies out there
 
02:08:30.950 --> 02:08:30.960 align:start position:0%
um we're looking probably to have to
 
02:08:34.589 --> 02:08:34.599 align:start position:0%
increase our um uh education as far as
 
02:08:35.990 --> 02:08:36.000 align:start position:0%
it goes with um standardized field
 
02:08:38.669 --> 02:08:38.679 align:start position:0%
sobriety test um getting more testing
 
02:08:40.870 --> 02:08:40.880 align:start position:0%
and so forth and officers Troopers and
 
02:08:43.790 --> 02:08:43.800 align:start position:0%
deputies educated in um field sobriety
 
02:08:47.030 --> 02:08:47.040 align:start position:0%
that would be um able to be utilized for
 
02:08:49.750 --> 02:08:49.760 align:start position:0%
um um the detection of uh canons with
 
02:08:52.149 --> 02:08:52.159 align:start position:0%
impaired driving um the other aspect of
 
02:08:54.470 --> 02:08:54.480 align:start position:0%
it too is something called aide um which
 
02:08:55.950 --> 02:08:55.960 align:start position:0%
is Advanced roadside impairment
 
02:08:58.709 --> 02:08:58.719 align:start position:0%
detection um education um that we're
 
02:09:00.790 --> 02:09:00.800 align:start position:0%
hoping to be able to then um teach to
 
02:09:02.629 --> 02:09:02.639 align:start position:0%
all of our Troopers officers and
 
02:09:04.870 --> 02:09:04.880 align:start position:0%
deputies out there um we're working very
 
02:09:06.790 --> 02:09:06.800 align:start position:0%
hard already as a state to do that um
 
02:09:09.109 --> 02:09:09.119 align:start position:0%
through the um drug uh evaluation and
 
02:09:10.990 --> 02:09:11.000 align:start position:0%
classification program but we just don't
 
02:09:12.669 --> 02:09:12.679 align:start position:0%
have the funding or the ability to get
 
02:09:14.149 --> 02:09:14.159 align:start position:0%
out there and teach all of these
 
02:09:15.950 --> 02:09:15.960 align:start position:0%
officers Troopers and deputies that
 
02:09:17.990 --> 02:09:18.000 align:start position:0%
particular course the other aspect of
 
02:09:20.390 --> 02:09:20.400 align:start position:0%
that is to increase our Dr program which
 
02:09:22.549 --> 02:09:22.559 align:start position:0%
is the drug recognition expert program
 
02:09:24.669 --> 02:09:24.679 align:start position:0%
that will help um correlate all of those
 
02:09:26.069 --> 02:09:26.079 align:start position:0%
different things together to show that
 
02:09:28.149 --> 02:09:28.159 align:start position:0%
that individual is actually impaired by
 
02:09:30.149 --> 02:09:30.159 align:start position:0%
cannabis when they're actually operating
 
02:09:33.310 --> 02:09:33.320 align:start position:0%
a motor vehicle boat ohrv and so forth
 
02:09:34.910 --> 02:09:34.920 align:start position:0%
so all of those trainings would need to
 
02:09:36.990 --> 02:09:37.000 align:start position:0%
come forth and then the bigger piece to
 
02:09:40.069 --> 02:09:40.079 align:start position:0%
that is our our laboratory uh right now
 
02:09:42.189 --> 02:09:42.199 align:start position:0%
uh our laboratory is very backed up um
 
02:09:43.950 --> 02:09:43.960 align:start position:0%
and Melissa could probably speak to that
 
02:09:46.990 --> 02:09:47.000 align:start position:0%
far better than I could um but we we
 
02:09:48.430 --> 02:09:48.440 align:start position:0%
need to help with testing we need need
 
02:09:49.830 --> 02:09:49.840 align:start position:0%
to help with the facility we need to
 
02:09:51.589 --> 02:09:51.599 align:start position:0%
help to be able to get those blood tests
 
02:09:53.390 --> 02:09:53.400 align:start position:0%
that are turned around and the other
 
02:09:55.589 --> 02:09:55.599 align:start position:0%
piece is the refusal piece that we um
 
02:09:58.390 --> 02:09:58.400 align:start position:0%
struggle here within New Hampshire um we
 
02:10:00.430 --> 02:10:00.440 align:start position:0%
have a an exorbitantly high refusal rate
 
02:10:01.830 --> 02:10:01.840 align:start position:0%
so to be able to have someone that's
 
02:10:05.270 --> 02:10:05.280 align:start position:0%
convicted of that marijuana or um THC um
 
02:10:07.709 --> 02:10:07.719 align:start position:0%
crime we need to be able to have um more
 
02:10:09.430 --> 02:10:09.440 align:start position:0%
tests and more evidence to be able to do
 
02:10:11.350 --> 02:10:11.360 align:start position:0%
that right now if someone refuses there
 
02:10:14.350 --> 02:10:14.360 align:start position:0%
is no Dr um evaluation there is no blood
 
02:10:16.990 --> 02:10:17.000 align:start position:0%
test so to be able to prove that and to
 
02:10:18.990 --> 02:10:19.000 align:start position:0%
make sure that we are doing it prop L we
 
02:10:21.830 --> 02:10:21.840 align:start position:0%
need to increase all of those aspects of
 
02:10:24.390 --> 02:10:24.400 align:start position:0%
that education and our laboratory to do
 
02:10:28.669 --> 02:10:28.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:31.629 --> 02:10:31.639 align:start position:0%
cost so let just ask some clarifying
 
02:10:33.109 --> 02:10:33.119 align:start position:0%
questions to make sure we all go on the
 
02:10:34.390 --> 02:10:34.400 align:start position:0%
same so when you're talking about
 
02:10:36.669 --> 02:10:36.679 align:start position:0%
refusal you talking refusal of fsts or
 
02:10:38.830 --> 02:10:38.840 align:start position:0%
refusal of blood draw all of the above
 
02:10:41.069 --> 02:10:41.079 align:start position:0%
Senator so as soon as you refuse one
 
02:10:43.470 --> 02:10:43.480 align:start position:0%
thing you refuse as far as the ALS
 
02:10:45.270 --> 02:10:45.280 align:start position:0%
process goes but as soon as you refuse
 
02:10:47.149 --> 02:10:47.159 align:start position:0%
anything we basically have no evidence
 
02:10:51.350 --> 02:10:51.360 align:start position:0%
to be able to prove a a solid um DUI
 
02:10:54.790 --> 02:10:54.800 align:start position:0%
conviction for a drug rated offense so
 
02:10:55.750 --> 02:10:55.760 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to remember because I think
 
02:10:58.629 --> 02:10:58.639 align:start position:0%
the statute changed refusals are is that
 
02:11:00.830 --> 02:11:00.840 align:start position:0%
just an administrative suspension when
 
02:11:02.830 --> 02:11:02.840 align:start position:0%
someone refuses or is that
 
02:11:04.870 --> 02:11:04.880 align:start position:0%
statutorily so so there's it's the
 
02:11:07.669 --> 02:11:07.679 align:start position:0%
two-prong system right so we have the
 
02:11:08.830 --> 02:11:08.840 align:start position:0%
administrative side of Health through
 
02:11:11.790 --> 02:11:11.800 align:start position:0%
the DMV which we talk about 265 A14 with
 
02:11:15.310 --> 02:11:15.320 align:start position:0%
all the the refusal pieces um so it is
 
02:11:17.430 --> 02:11:17.440 align:start position:0%
that two-prong system so the best way to
 
02:11:20.069 --> 02:11:20.079 align:start position:0%
explain to that is is hey that
 
02:11:22.470 --> 02:11:22.480 align:start position:0%
individual gets arrested for DWI they
 
02:11:23.990 --> 02:11:24.000 align:start position:0%
are criminally charged but there's also
 
02:11:26.790 --> 02:11:26.800 align:start position:0%
the administrative side by the dsnv 426
 
02:11:29.069 --> 02:11:29.079 align:start position:0%
form which is the ALS form that we read
 
02:11:30.830 --> 02:11:30.840 align:start position:0%
that set of administrative rights to
 
02:11:33.149 --> 02:11:33.159 align:start position:0%
that individual to have them either take
 
02:11:36.390 --> 02:11:36.400 align:start position:0%
a test or not take a test and right now
 
02:11:37.709 --> 02:11:37.719 align:start position:0%
our state is obviously one of the
 
02:11:40.149 --> 02:11:40.159 align:start position:0%
highest refusal states in the country um
 
02:11:42.750 --> 02:11:42.760 align:start position:0%
so to be able to have and get that
 
02:11:44.270 --> 02:11:44.280 align:start position:0%
evidence that we need to prove that
 
02:11:46.709 --> 02:11:46.719 align:start position:0%
someone is actually under the influence
 
02:11:51.109 --> 02:11:51.119 align:start position:0%
of um cannabis or THC we need to have um
 
02:11:52.950 --> 02:11:52.960 align:start position:0%
those tests to be able to prove that
 
02:11:54.470 --> 02:11:54.480 align:start position:0%
case and make it right for that
 
02:11:54.480 --> 02:11:55.430 align:start position:0%
case and make it right for that
particular

02:11:55.430 --> 02:11:55.440 align:start position:0%
particular
 
02:11:57.149 --> 02:11:57.159 align:start position:0%
individual does that answer your
 
02:12:00.390 --> 02:12:00.400 align:start position:0%
question it does I I I guess my question
 
02:12:02.149 --> 02:12:02.159 align:start position:0%
is given how high a refusal raate is
 
02:12:03.270 --> 02:12:03.280 align:start position:0%
probably outside the scope of this
 
02:12:04.910 --> 02:12:04.920 align:start position:0%
commission but maybe it's time to review
 
02:12:06.430 --> 02:12:06.440 align:start position:0%
that statute again and make the penalty
 
02:12:08.510 --> 02:12:08.520 align:start position:0%
a little higher to to encourage
 
02:12:11.069 --> 02:12:11.079 align:start position:0%
compliance agreed sir um but we can pick
 
02:12:12.470 --> 02:12:12.480 align:start position:0%
that up another time on a different
 
02:12:16.870 --> 02:12:16.880 align:start position:0%
topic um Frank and then Senator Ganon
 
02:12:19.030 --> 02:12:19.040 align:start position:0%
thank uh just quick questions so how do
 
02:12:20.910 --> 02:12:20.920 align:start position:0%
you all kind of investigate right now
 
02:12:22.910 --> 02:12:22.920 align:start position:0%
and then T is it through the Dr program
 
02:12:24.030 --> 02:12:24.040 align:start position:0%
people who are driving under the
 
02:12:25.310 --> 02:12:25.320 align:start position:0%
influence of opioids or other
 
02:12:27.270 --> 02:12:27.280 align:start position:0%
prescription drugs the exact same
 
02:12:29.189 --> 02:12:29.199 align:start position:0%
process sir so it it's the same thing it
 
02:12:31.350 --> 02:12:31.360 align:start position:0%
would be roadside field sobriety tests
 
02:12:32.950 --> 02:12:32.960 align:start position:0%
um there would be determination to um
 
02:12:34.350 --> 02:12:34.360 align:start position:0%
develop basically probable cause that
 
02:12:35.990 --> 02:12:36.000 align:start position:0%
that particular individual is under the
 
02:12:37.910 --> 02:12:37.920 align:start position:0%
influence of whatever substance it may
 
02:12:39.629 --> 02:12:39.639 align:start position:0%
be they're placed under arrest they're
 
02:12:40.910 --> 02:12:40.920 align:start position:0%
brought back they're read their
 
02:12:42.750 --> 02:12:42.760 align:start position:0%
administrative license suspension rights
 
02:12:44.189 --> 02:12:44.199 align:start position:0%
and then it's up to them whether they
 
02:12:48.350 --> 02:12:48.360 align:start position:0%
take a test or not take a test thank you
 
02:12:49.109 --> 02:12:49.119 align:start position:0%
I think there's going to be a
 
02:12:50.629 --> 02:12:50.639 align:start position:0%
conversation later on about whether or
 
02:12:52.990 --> 02:12:53.000 align:start position:0%
not we amend 265 to allow a crime of
 
02:12:55.709 --> 02:12:55.719 align:start position:0%
facial level of Poss in in a blood
 
02:12:59.270 --> 02:12:59.280 align:start position:0%
sample but we're not there yet send
 
02:13:02.189 --> 02:13:02.199 align:start position:0%
again submits to a blood test is there a
 
02:13:04.589 --> 02:13:04.599 align:start position:0%
certain THC level that I'm not aware
 
02:13:08.310 --> 02:13:08.320 align:start position:0%
that say you're like number
 
02:13:11.030 --> 02:13:11.040 align:start position:0%
like so there's a lot of talk about that
 
02:13:12.350 --> 02:13:12.360 align:start position:0%
and there right now here in New
 
02:13:14.589 --> 02:13:14.599 align:start position:0%
Hampshire there is not and um I can tell
 
02:13:15.750 --> 02:13:15.760 align:start position:0%
you from the Department of Safety side
 
02:13:17.430 --> 02:13:17.440 align:start position:0%
of the house we are not asking for that
 
02:13:18.950 --> 02:13:18.960 align:start position:0%
nor do we think that that is something
 
02:13:20.430 --> 02:13:20.440 align:start position:0%
that's appropriate nationally there's
 
02:13:23.109 --> 02:13:23.119 align:start position:0%
nothing siid there are certain states
 
02:13:24.470 --> 02:13:24.480 align:start position:0%
there are certain states that do have
 
02:13:28.189 --> 02:13:28.199 align:start position:0%
per se laws for um for THC
 
02:13:31.069 --> 02:13:31.079 align:start position:0%
um okay thanks so Bill just don't inste
 
02:13:32.629 --> 02:13:32.639 align:start position:0%
of again just know I'm going to ask the
 
02:13:34.069 --> 02:13:34.079 align:start position:0%
doctor over there to do some research
 
02:13:36.870 --> 02:13:36.880 align:start position:0%
for us um to give us a standard that we
 
02:13:39.149 --> 02:13:39.159 align:start position:0%
potentially use in 265 to establish a
 
02:13:42.270 --> 02:13:42.280 align:start position:0%
primate faal standard for impairment so
 
02:13:44.990 --> 02:13:45.000 align:start position:0%
Chief yes just to bring it to a more of
 
02:13:48.149 --> 02:13:48.159 align:start position:0%
a precise pinpoint here would with
 
02:13:50.950 --> 02:13:50.960 align:start position:0%
respect to collisions that result in
 
02:13:53.790 --> 02:13:53.800 align:start position:0%
serious bodily injury and or fatalities
 
02:13:57.709 --> 02:13:57.719 align:start position:0%
right um often times if the operator uh
 
02:13:59.109 --> 02:13:59.119 align:start position:0%
suspected operator that caused the
 
02:14:00.549 --> 02:14:00.559 align:start position:0%
Collision who may be impaired by
 
02:14:05.270 --> 02:14:05.280 align:start position:0%
cannabis or other drugs is uh um not
 
02:14:08.470 --> 02:14:08.480 align:start position:0%
able to submit to test uh U due to
 
02:14:12.229 --> 02:14:12.239 align:start position:0%
injury or other reasons uh but even may
 
02:14:16.629 --> 02:14:16.639 align:start position:0%
be subject to mandatory blood draw uh we
 
02:14:19.310 --> 02:14:19.320 align:start position:0%
we still are hampered here in the state
 
02:14:22.149 --> 02:14:22.159 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire with respect to gaining
 
02:14:24.310 --> 02:14:24.320 align:start position:0%
any conviction with respect to
 
02:14:26.430 --> 02:14:26.440 align:start position:0%
impairment there is no operation you
 
02:14:27.790 --> 02:14:27.800 align:start position:0%
just arrive at the scene of the
 
02:14:29.950 --> 02:14:29.960 align:start position:0%
Collision uh and you have injured
 
02:14:31.510 --> 02:14:31.520 align:start position:0%
operators uh including the one that
 
02:14:33.549 --> 02:14:33.559 align:start position:0%
caused the Collision uh who may be
 
02:14:36.189 --> 02:14:36.199 align:start position:0%
impaired so there there should be
 
02:14:37.430 --> 02:14:37.440 align:start position:0%
whether or not as part of this
 
02:14:39.030 --> 02:14:39.040 align:start position:0%
discussion with this commission or
 
02:14:41.510 --> 02:14:41.520 align:start position:0%
elsewhere uh looking at other Provisions
 
02:14:44.589 --> 02:14:44.599 align:start position:0%
where other states have enacted uh some
 
02:14:47.709 --> 02:14:47.719 align:start position:0%
Provisions with respect to either blood
 
02:14:51.790 --> 02:14:51.800 align:start position:0%
uh or other testing uh as the trooper
 
02:14:54.149 --> 02:14:54.159 align:start position:0%
indicated that uh would provide us with
 
02:14:57.669 --> 02:14:57.679 align:start position:0%
a better U Better process of gaining
 
02:15:00.270 --> 02:15:00.280 align:start position:0%
convis because right now I can tell you
 
02:15:02.910 --> 02:15:02.920 align:start position:0%
and and Trooper may be able to validate
 
02:15:05.790 --> 02:15:05.800 align:start position:0%
or not that we have a very very steep
 
02:15:08.350 --> 02:15:08.360 align:start position:0%
challenge uh not only with all DUIs but
 
02:15:10.830 --> 02:15:10.840 align:start position:0%
particularly with cannabis related uh
 
02:15:13.229 --> 02:15:13.239 align:start position:0%
DUIs and in the state of New Hampshire
 
02:15:15.470 --> 02:15:15.480 align:start position:0%
and that is only going to increase and
 
02:15:18.510 --> 02:15:18.520 align:start position:0%
there is a significant concern amongst
 
02:15:20.830 --> 02:15:20.840 align:start position:0%
the Chiefs throughout the state with
 
02:15:23.990 --> 02:15:24.000 align:start position:0%
respect to how uh cannabis legalization
 
02:15:26.390 --> 02:15:26.400 align:start position:0%
will impact the safety on our
 
02:15:29.350 --> 02:15:29.360 align:start position:0%
roads you have something else yeah I
 
02:15:30.350 --> 02:15:30.360 align:start position:0%
just was gonna ask him a couple
 
02:15:33.629 --> 02:15:33.639 align:start position:0%
questions so sir if if you're driving
 
02:15:36.229 --> 02:15:36.239 align:start position:0%
down the road and and you see someone
 
02:15:39.149 --> 02:15:39.159 align:start position:0%
smoking and you smell the smoke do you
 
02:15:40.910 --> 02:15:40.920 align:start position:0%
really have to do a a blood test to
 
02:15:42.990 --> 02:15:43.000 align:start position:0%
charge them with smoking and and driving
 
02:15:46.790 --> 02:15:46.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:46.800 --> 02:15:49.709 align:start position:0%
 
sir

02:15:49.709 --> 02:15:49.719 align:start position:0%
sir
 
02:15:54.030 --> 02:15:54.040 align:start position:0%
um Jordan yeah um
 
02:15:56.390 --> 02:15:56.400 align:start position:0%
Lieutenant correct me if I'm wrong we
 
02:15:58.030 --> 02:15:58.040 align:start position:0%
going to say
 
02:16:01.950 --> 02:16:01.960 align:start position:0%
that it's the operation of the vehicle
 
02:16:04.229 --> 02:16:04.239 align:start position:0%
not the condition of the driver that
 
02:16:09.030 --> 02:16:09.040 align:start position:0%
first attracts the attention of the um
 
02:16:11.430 --> 02:16:11.440 align:start position:0%
law enforcement officer you got somebody
 
02:16:12.990 --> 02:16:13.000 align:start position:0%
that's bouncing between the yellow and
 
02:16:15.910 --> 02:16:15.920 align:start position:0%
the white line that's an indication that
 
02:16:18.109 --> 02:16:18.119 align:start position:0%
an individual should be stopped aside
 
02:16:21.350 --> 02:16:21.360 align:start position:0%
from the the typical certain certain
 
02:16:23.470 --> 02:16:23.480 align:start position:0%
tail light out Etc yes represented
 
02:16:24.870 --> 02:16:24.880 align:start position:0%
certainly that would be definitely one
 
02:16:26.790 --> 02:16:26.800 align:start position:0%
indicator that absolutely but there are
 
02:16:29.589 --> 02:16:29.599 align:start position:0%
many times when um you different traffic
 
02:16:31.229 --> 02:16:31.239 align:start position:0%
violations you end up walking up to the
 
02:16:32.870 --> 02:16:32.880 align:start position:0%
vehicle and there's certain indications
 
02:16:34.709 --> 02:16:34.719 align:start position:0%
that that person is impaired so it's not
 
02:16:36.469 --> 02:16:36.479 align:start position:0%
necessarily just the operation of the
 
02:16:39.629 --> 02:16:39.639 align:start position:0%
vehicle and then follow up on that uh
 
02:16:43.830 --> 02:16:43.840 align:start position:0%
because of the longterm retention of
 
02:16:45.790 --> 02:16:45.800 align:start position:0%
cannaboids in the blood system and the
 
02:16:48.709 --> 02:16:48.719 align:start position:0%
metabolism by the liver how do you know
 
02:16:51.030 --> 02:16:51.040 align:start position:0%
there wasn't six weeks ago six months
 
02:16:53.709 --> 02:16:53.719 align:start position:0%
ago that the individual was that's a
 
02:16:55.429 --> 02:16:55.439 align:start position:0%
Melissa question I can answer some of
 
02:16:57.790 --> 02:16:57.800 align:start position:0%
that for you um but yes you are correct
 
02:16:59.830 --> 02:16:59.840 align:start position:0%
there is a longstanding for different
 
02:17:01.389 --> 02:17:01.399 align:start position:0%
metabolics of cannabis to stay in your
 
02:17:03.509 --> 02:17:03.519 align:start position:0%
system there's lots of research out
 
02:17:06.230 --> 02:17:06.240 align:start position:0%
there talking about um how those levels
 
02:17:08.990 --> 02:17:09.000 align:start position:0%
are all different in all different
 
02:17:11.030 --> 02:17:11.040 align:start position:0%
individuals I think it's to say
 
02:17:12.910 --> 02:17:12.920 align:start position:0%
Lieutenant that any given case even a
 
02:17:16.110 --> 02:17:16.120 align:start position:0%
DUI for alcohol is a cumulative of of of
 
02:17:18.349 --> 02:17:18.359 align:start position:0%
facts not just a single in a fact
 
02:17:19.429 --> 02:17:19.439 align:start position:0%
absolutely it's a totality of the
 
02:17:24.070 --> 02:17:24.080 align:start position:0%
circumstances correct absolutely C so
 
02:17:28.110 --> 02:17:28.120 align:start position:0%
Frank Frank um and so in in the draft
 
02:17:29.709 --> 02:17:29.719 align:start position:0%
bill that we have now we have in terms
 
02:17:31.309 --> 02:17:31.319 align:start position:0%
of where the revenue is going some money
 
02:17:33.870 --> 02:17:33.880 align:start position:0%
going to for Dr so that you all can have
 
02:17:35.270 --> 02:17:35.280 align:start position:0%
more expansive opportunities there is
 
02:17:36.750 --> 02:17:36.760 align:start position:0%
that the kind of thing you'd want to see
 
02:17:39.910 --> 02:17:39.920 align:start position:0%
then absolutely not only not only the um
 
02:17:41.669 --> 02:17:41.679 align:start position:0%
the the training the education for um
 
02:17:44.509 --> 02:17:44.519 align:start position:0%
the officers we're also um where we in
 
02:17:46.150 --> 02:17:46.160 align:start position:0%
the drug recognition expert program are
 
02:17:48.110 --> 02:17:48.120 align:start position:0%
also out in our schools out in our
 
02:17:50.150 --> 02:17:50.160 align:start position:0%
communities um trying to educate not
 
02:17:52.790 --> 02:17:52.800 align:start position:0%
only um our saus in um when they're
 
02:17:55.190 --> 02:17:55.200 align:start position:0%
dealing with impaired children or when
 
02:17:57.990 --> 02:17:58.000 align:start position:0%
um workers from different um uh
 
02:17:59.669 --> 02:17:59.679 align:start position:0%
different facets of the community are
 
02:18:01.589 --> 02:18:01.599 align:start position:0%
looking to see hey can we tell if that
 
02:18:03.830 --> 02:18:03.840 align:start position:0%
particular employee impaired we as the
 
02:18:05.309 --> 02:18:05.319 align:start position:0%
state police and the drug recognition
 
02:18:07.629 --> 02:18:07.639 align:start position:0%
expert we go out and assist them to help
 
02:18:09.709 --> 02:18:09.719 align:start position:0%
show signs and symptomology that those
 
02:18:11.030 --> 02:18:11.040 align:start position:0%
particular individuals are under the
 
02:18:12.990 --> 02:18:13.000 align:start position:0%
influence so we need lots of training to
 
02:18:14.629 --> 02:18:14.639 align:start position:0%
be able to do that to be able to get out
 
02:18:16.230 --> 02:18:16.240 align:start position:0%
there in the community and not just out
 
02:18:18.830 --> 02:18:18.840 align:start position:0%
there enforcing it but also educ edating
 
02:18:21.309 --> 02:18:21.319 align:start position:0%
thank you so do understand Lieutenant
 
02:18:22.830 --> 02:18:22.840 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry just to I'm sure you want to
 
02:18:26.150 --> 02:18:26.160 align:start position:0%
be a cheap one anybody um um it's
 
02:18:28.509 --> 02:18:28.519 align:start position:0%
estimated we we're put about 5% of All
 
02:18:30.750 --> 02:18:30.760 align:start position:0%
State of the State Revenue in which is
 
02:18:33.230 --> 02:18:33.240 align:start position:0%
estimated about $1.8 million to go
 
02:18:35.589 --> 02:18:35.599 align:start position:0%
specifically for training purposes for
 
02:18:37.349 --> 02:18:37.359 align:start position:0%
law enforcement to be able to we
 
02:18:38.750 --> 02:18:38.760 align:start position:0%
recognize you're going to have a harder
 
02:18:40.469 --> 02:18:40.479 align:start position:0%
job and you need you need the tools
 
02:18:42.870 --> 02:18:42.880 align:start position:0%
necessary to do it so there's 5% of that
 
02:18:44.389 --> 02:18:44.399 align:start position:0%
Revenue being earmarked for law
 
02:18:45.870 --> 02:18:45.880 align:start position:0%
enforcement training I think one of the
 
02:18:47.709 --> 02:18:47.719 align:start position:0%
bigger ones that um we have to consider
 
02:18:50.110 --> 02:18:50.120 align:start position:0%
two is the lab the lab um is going to
 
02:18:53.030 --> 02:18:53.040 align:start position:0%
take a lot of funding to make this um to
 
02:18:55.150 --> 02:18:55.160 align:start position:0%
work properly um and to be able to do
 
02:18:56.629 --> 02:18:56.639 align:start position:0%
those blood tests and to give them the
 
02:18:59.110 --> 02:18:59.120 align:start position:0%
resources that we need to do too so
 
02:19:00.309 --> 02:19:00.319 align:start position:0%
that's probably a commissioner Quinn
 
02:19:02.750 --> 02:19:02.760 align:start position:0%
question but yeah we'll find out what
 
02:19:03.910 --> 02:19:03.920 align:start position:0%
that number looks like and again that
 
02:19:05.990 --> 02:19:06.000 align:start position:0%
may fall underneath the operational as
 
02:19:07.669 --> 02:19:07.679 align:start position:0%
some operational expenses that we put
 
02:19:12.389 --> 02:19:12.399 align:start position:0%
before we give you money out so um any
 
02:19:14.910 --> 02:19:14.920 align:start position:0%
nope we good any other questions on so
 
02:19:16.910 --> 02:19:16.920 align:start position:0%
um we'll look at 265a again I'm going to
 
02:19:18.509 --> 02:19:18.519 align:start position:0%
ask the do to do homework and see if she
 
02:19:20.750 --> 02:19:20.760 align:start position:0%
can find some sort
 
02:19:23.190 --> 02:19:23.200 align:start position:0%
of okay let's we'll talk about that when
 
02:19:25.709 --> 02:19:25.719 align:start position:0%
we we get there um anything else under
 
02:19:28.110 --> 02:19:28.120 align:start position:0%
18 did we finish
 
02:19:32.589 --> 02:19:32.599 align:start position:0%
it yeah everybody okay with 18 thank you
 
02:19:34.509 --> 02:19:34.519 align:start position:0%
lieutenant thank you if you want to
 
02:19:35.870 --> 02:19:35.880 align:start position:0%
stick around we're gonna ask the doctor
 
02:19:37.150 --> 02:19:37.160 align:start position:0%
I'm gonna have you jump in right now
 
02:19:39.150 --> 02:19:39.160 align:start position:0%
before because I have to leave in the
 
02:19:40.349 --> 02:19:40.359 align:start position:0%
next 20 minutes and I'd like to be
 
02:19:42.110 --> 02:19:42.120 align:start position:0%
involved in this discussion so why don't
 
02:19:43.910 --> 02:19:43.920 align:start position:0%
we talk about possible changes need up
 
02:19:47.790 --> 02:19:47.800 align:start position:0%
at 265a the DUI statute um in order to
 
02:19:50.910 --> 02:19:50.920 align:start position:0%
make enforcement you know more doable
 
02:19:52.150 --> 02:19:52.160 align:start position:0%
now that we're adding some more
 
02:19:55.910 --> 02:19:55.920 align:start position:0%
complexity to it okay so I I did a deep
 
02:19:57.790 --> 02:19:57.800 align:start position:0%
dive here on a couple of facets that we
 
02:20:00.070 --> 02:20:00.080 align:start position:0%
all you know were were were discussing
 
02:20:02.710 --> 02:20:02.720 align:start position:0%
at the last meeting and so um I know
 
02:20:04.950 --> 02:20:04.960 align:start position:0%
that the medical society sent out some
 
02:20:06.469 --> 02:20:06.479 align:start position:0%
articles I don't know if those just went
 
02:20:08.230 --> 02:20:08.240 align:start position:0%
to Senator abbis or if they went to the
 
02:20:11.590 --> 02:20:11.600 align:start position:0%
whole committee this morning um but no
 
02:20:13.790 --> 02:20:13.800 align:start position:0%
it's not that that was included also but
 
02:20:16.750 --> 02:20:16.760 align:start position:0%
um but if not I'm happy to provide them
 
02:20:20.910 --> 02:20:20.920 align:start position:0%
um so you know I think the overall um
 
02:20:23.910 --> 02:20:23.920 align:start position:0%
tone was that there's really been no
 
02:20:25.670 --> 02:20:25.680 align:start position:0%
correlation found between the debr of
 
02:20:27.950 --> 02:20:27.960 align:start position:0%
intoxication or impairment um and the
 
02:20:31.870 --> 02:20:31.880 align:start position:0%
THC level concentration in the blood um
 
02:20:34.070 --> 02:20:34.080 align:start position:0%
the other um challenge that we were
 
02:20:36.990 --> 02:20:37.000 align:start position:0%
talking about is that you know not
 
02:20:40.230 --> 02:20:40.240 align:start position:0%
having people who uh were inadvertently
 
02:20:42.750 --> 02:20:42.760 align:start position:0%
um breaking the law even if they were
 
02:20:44.910 --> 02:20:44.920 align:start position:0%
not driving intoxicated in in in the
 
02:20:47.590 --> 02:20:47.600 align:start position:0%
situation of chronic users and uh
 
02:20:49.910 --> 02:20:49.920 align:start position:0%
there's a really good um meta analysis
 
02:20:51.550 --> 02:20:51.560 align:start position:0%
that essentially goes over all of the
 
02:20:54.630 --> 02:20:54.640 align:start position:0%
data that um was available you know two
 
02:20:57.110 --> 02:20:57.120 align:start position:0%
years ago that showed that even people
 
02:20:59.830 --> 02:20:59.840 align:start position:0%
who were observed to abstain for over a
 
02:21:03.510 --> 02:21:03.520 align:start position:0%
day um there are still people who would
 
02:21:06.469 --> 02:21:06.479 align:start position:0%
test positive at greater than 22 hours
 
02:21:08.469 --> 02:21:08.479 align:start position:0%
and these are people who you know were
 
02:21:09.990 --> 02:21:10.000 align:start position:0%
observed smoking admitted to the
 
02:21:11.429 --> 02:21:11.439 align:start position:0%
hospital for one reason or another they
 
02:21:13.190 --> 02:21:13.200 align:start position:0%
know they have abstained testing blood
 
02:21:15.309 --> 02:21:15.319 align:start position:0%
levels at certain times um and were
 
02:21:18.790 --> 02:21:18.800 align:start position:0%
still above even the um five nanograms
 
02:21:21.110 --> 02:21:21.120 align:start position:0%
per microl ler um so I think that
 
02:21:23.349 --> 02:21:23.359 align:start position:0%
there's certainly some challenges there
 
02:21:27.309 --> 02:21:27.319 align:start position:0%
of of capturing um some some people uh
 
02:21:31.790 --> 02:21:31.800 align:start position:0%
who are not um intoxicated um or altered
 
02:21:35.349 --> 02:21:35.359 align:start position:0%
um that would still test positive um the
 
02:21:38.110 --> 02:21:38.120 align:start position:0%
other um thing that I think speaks to
 
02:21:39.790 --> 02:21:39.800 align:start position:0%
this was a sort of correlation between
 
02:21:41.990 --> 02:21:42.000 align:start position:0%
oral fluid and blood uh THC
 
02:21:44.710 --> 02:21:44.720 align:start position:0%
concentrations um which overall was poor
 
02:21:46.910 --> 02:21:46.920 align:start position:0%
but it it in this particular article did
 
02:21:49.990 --> 02:21:50.000 align:start position:0%
discuss that oral fluid THC did appear
 
02:21:52.030 --> 02:21:52.040 align:start position:0%
to have some utility for investigating
 
02:21:54.630 --> 02:21:54.640 align:start position:0%
high-risk drivers who have already come
 
02:21:56.389 --> 02:21:56.399 align:start position:0%
to the police attention for evidence of
 
02:22:01.429 --> 02:22:01.439 align:start position:0%
impairment um as as as um the police uh
 
02:22:03.469 --> 02:22:03.479 align:start position:0%
officer just was discussing with us so
 
02:22:06.349 --> 02:22:06.359 align:start position:0%
not it's a lot of false positives um if
 
02:22:08.389 --> 02:22:08.399 align:start position:0%
you were just testing everyone um but if
 
02:22:10.510 --> 02:22:10.520 align:start position:0%
you're testing someone who has at high
 
02:22:11.830 --> 02:22:11.840 align:start position:0%
risk driving because they appear
 
02:22:16.150 --> 02:22:16.160 align:start position:0%
impaired um that that was a useful uh
 
02:22:16.160 --> 02:22:19.750 align:start position:0%
impaired um that that was a useful uh
tool

02:22:19.750 --> 02:22:19.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:21.630 --> 02:22:21.640 align:start position:0%
um Chief and
 
02:22:24.190 --> 02:22:24.200 align:start position:0%
then yes thank you and and uh I
 
02:22:26.309 --> 02:22:26.319 align:start position:0%
certainly agree with uh the results of
 
02:22:29.030 --> 02:22:29.040 align:start position:0%
those studies when when we've looked at
 
02:22:31.270 --> 02:22:31.280 align:start position:0%
other studies uh there was a fairly
 
02:22:32.870 --> 02:22:32.880 align:start position:0%
Landmark study I don't know if the good
 
02:22:35.590 --> 02:22:35.600 align:start position:0%
doctor was able to find this out of Ohio
 
02:22:39.830 --> 02:22:39.840 align:start position:0%
that looked at the uh ability for
 
02:22:43.150 --> 02:22:43.160 align:start position:0%
operators uh in um with respect to the
 
02:22:45.670 --> 02:22:45.680 align:start position:0%
decision- making uh and impairment
 
02:22:49.150 --> 02:22:49.160 align:start position:0%
actions um uh under a test environment
 
02:22:51.510 --> 02:22:51.520 align:start position:0%
after they have
 
02:22:53.990 --> 02:22:54.000 align:start position:0%
consumed uh and then there is some
 
02:22:57.830 --> 02:22:57.840 align:start position:0%
significant lapse in Period of time uh
 
02:23:01.030 --> 02:23:01.040 align:start position:0%
involving people that are chronic heavy
 
02:23:03.670 --> 02:23:03.680 align:start position:0%
cannabis use disorder uh patients and
 
02:23:05.790 --> 02:23:05.800 align:start position:0%
showed significant driving impairment
 
02:23:09.590 --> 02:23:09.600 align:start position:0%
even days after the the issue here
 
02:23:12.630 --> 02:23:12.640 align:start position:0%
really goes to whether or not the state
 
02:23:18.030 --> 02:23:18.040 align:start position:0%
wants to look at ways of making uh uh
 
02:23:18.040 --> 02:23:20.110 align:start position:0%
wants to look at ways of making uh uh
cannabis

02:23:20.110 --> 02:23:20.120 align:start position:0%
cannabis
 
02:23:24.030 --> 02:23:24.040 align:start position:0%
DUI uh conviction within the realm of
 
02:23:28.070 --> 02:23:28.080 align:start position:0%
possibility um uh in a legal way uh the
 
02:23:30.670 --> 02:23:30.680 align:start position:0%
states that have looked at
 
02:23:35.070 --> 02:23:35.080 align:start position:0%
limits probably the most appropriate way
 
02:23:37.429 --> 02:23:37.439 align:start position:0%
to look at it is not in a per se limit
 
02:23:39.389 --> 02:23:39.399 align:start position:0%
but in a prima fascia case which simply
 
02:23:41.510 --> 02:23:41.520 align:start position:0%
says that whatever limit that's
 
02:23:43.309 --> 02:23:43.319 align:start position:0%
arbitrarily opposed and again it's an
 
02:23:45.349 --> 02:23:45.359 align:start position:0%
arbitrary limit clearly those state
 
02:23:48.030 --> 02:23:48.040 align:start position:0%
legislator have indicated that that it
 
02:23:48.040 --> 02:23:49.510 align:start position:0%
legislator have indicated that that it
simply

02:23:49.510 --> 02:23:49.520 align:start position:0%
simply
 
02:23:52.870 --> 02:23:52.880 align:start position:0%
is uh a matter that can be
 
02:23:55.830 --> 02:23:55.840 align:start position:0%
considered by the judge in determining
 
02:23:58.389 --> 02:23:58.399 align:start position:0%
impairment much like the results of
 
02:24:01.469 --> 02:24:01.479 align:start position:0%
observation and the results of Dr
 
02:24:05.269 --> 02:24:05.279 align:start position:0%
testing uh it's only a prima fascia
 
02:24:08.150 --> 02:24:08.160 align:start position:0%
element in the overall
 
02:24:10.070 --> 02:24:10.080 align:start position:0%
determination so there is a subtle
 
02:24:13.950 --> 02:24:13.960 align:start position:0%
Nuance there that perhaps
 
02:24:18.309 --> 02:24:18.319 align:start position:0%
um not for not perhaps Germain for this
 
02:24:19.790 --> 02:24:19.800 align:start position:0%
particular commission but a
 
02:24:22.870 --> 02:24:22.880 align:start position:0%
recommendation that a study look at
 
02:24:24.990 --> 02:24:25.000 align:start position:0%
study commission look at whether or not
 
02:24:30.030 --> 02:24:30.040 align:start position:0%
265a should be uh amended to include uh
 
02:24:32.990 --> 02:24:33.000 align:start position:0%
some provision uh that would result in
 
02:24:36.349 --> 02:24:36.359 align:start position:0%
some premma fascia changes that would uh
 
02:24:38.070 --> 02:24:38.080 align:start position:0%
enhance the ability for law enforcement
 
02:24:41.870 --> 02:24:41.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:44.750 --> 02:24:44.760 align:start position:0%
safe so again the question goes down to
 
02:24:46.910 --> 02:24:46.920 align:start position:0%
we have the 0.08 limit in alcohol the
 
02:24:50.309 --> 02:24:50.319 align:start position:0%
.16 limit for aggravated um in our and
 
02:24:51.670 --> 02:24:51.680 align:start position:0%
understanding that a totality of the
 
02:24:53.309 --> 02:24:53.319 align:start position:0%
circumstances as the lieutenant said
 
02:24:55.269 --> 02:24:55.279 align:start position:0%
right it's all things you can just pull
 
02:24:56.750 --> 02:24:56.760 align:start position:0%
somebody over and draw their blood find
 
02:24:59.110 --> 02:24:59.120 align:start position:0%
out they're point you know they're five
 
02:25:02.710 --> 02:25:02.720 align:start position:0%
NG per milliliter um nanogram per Mill
 
02:25:04.830 --> 02:25:04.840 align:start position:0%
and ARR them for impairment you know you
 
02:25:07.030 --> 02:25:07.040 align:start position:0%
have to have other facts associated with
 
02:25:09.110 --> 02:25:09.120 align:start position:0%
that stop right there has to be prob
 
02:25:10.070 --> 02:25:10.080 align:start position:0%
there has to be first Reasonable
 
02:25:11.510 --> 02:25:11.520 align:start position:0%
Suspicion for the Stop and then you have
 
02:25:13.230 --> 02:25:13.240 align:start position:0%
to develop a probable cause for the
 
02:25:14.990 --> 02:25:15.000 align:start position:0%
arrest before you even get to the blood
 
02:25:17.590 --> 02:25:17.600 align:start position:0%
or brealy right so it's a totality of
 
02:25:20.070 --> 02:25:20.080 align:start position:0%
fact situation but the question is just
 
02:25:21.710 --> 02:25:21.720 align:start position:0%
like we've established a standard for
 
02:25:23.750 --> 02:25:23.760 align:start position:0%
alcohol is there a standard we could put
 
02:25:26.870 --> 02:25:26.880 align:start position:0%
in the 128 in the 265a statute that
 
02:25:28.510 --> 02:25:28.520 align:start position:0%
would make it easier for law enforcement
 
02:25:31.150 --> 02:25:31.160 align:start position:0%
be able to to effectively prosecute
 
02:25:33.870 --> 02:25:33.880 align:start position:0%
cases of impairment due to marijuana
 
02:25:36.469 --> 02:25:36.479 align:start position:0%
consumption that's the question not in
 
02:25:38.910 --> 02:25:38.920 align:start position:0%
connection with a Hardline limit like 08
 
02:25:41.510 --> 02:25:41.520 align:start position:0%
is um and I think that's where the
 
02:25:43.710 --> 02:25:43.720 align:start position:0%
science uh is right now because the
 
02:25:46.030 --> 02:25:46.040 align:start position:0%
science is clear that there is no
 
02:25:48.590 --> 02:25:48.600 align:start position:0%
scientific per se limit that says a
 
02:25:51.670 --> 02:25:51.680 align:start position:0%
person at x amount of THC in their
 
02:25:56.190 --> 02:25:56.200 align:start position:0%
bloodstream is impaired uh so uh given
 
02:25:58.590 --> 02:25:58.600 align:start position:0%
that their alternative would be to
 
02:26:02.910 --> 02:26:02.920 align:start position:0%
Simply indicate that a limit uh or a
 
02:26:06.150 --> 02:26:06.160 align:start position:0%
amount above a particular limit presents
 
02:26:09.469 --> 02:26:09.479 align:start position:0%
a prima fascia indication not a actual
 
02:26:11.030 --> 02:26:11.040 align:start position:0%
indication of
 
02:26:14.389 --> 02:26:14.399 align:start position:0%
impairment and and that's that's perhaps
 
02:26:17.030 --> 02:26:17.040 align:start position:0%
um the correct way to look at that's
 
02:26:19.230 --> 02:26:19.240 align:start position:0%
what some other states have done not all
 
02:26:20.830 --> 02:26:20.840 align:start position:0%
there are states that are per se that
 
02:26:24.070 --> 02:26:24.080 align:start position:0%
have drawn the same limit just like 008
 
02:26:25.710 --> 02:26:25.720 align:start position:0%
and that's what it is and there's other
 
02:26:27.790 --> 02:26:27.800 align:start position:0%
states that simply look at this as a
 
02:26:30.389 --> 02:26:30.399 align:start position:0%
another element uh in terms of
 
02:26:33.630 --> 02:26:33.640 align:start position:0%
establishing a pre pran fascia case um
 
02:26:36.910 --> 02:26:36.920 align:start position:0%
that still needs to be proved up for
 
02:26:39.590 --> 02:26:39.600 align:start position:0%
impairment so you you can get even in
 
02:26:41.990 --> 02:26:42.000 align:start position:0%
alcohol right you can get convicted of
 
02:26:44.910 --> 02:26:44.920 align:start position:0%
DUI and be under an o08 right it's about
 
02:26:47.150 --> 02:26:47.160 align:start position:0%
your driving right it's about the impair
 
02:26:49.670 --> 02:26:49.680 align:start position:0%
itself so Prime theoh is is kind of the
 
02:26:52.590 --> 02:26:52.600 align:start position:0%
nail in the coffin so to speak um but
 
02:26:54.870 --> 02:26:54.880 align:start position:0%
the but you can have somebody who blows
 
02:26:56.429 --> 02:26:56.439 align:start position:0%
an ' 06 if I could still prove
 
02:26:57.790 --> 02:26:57.800 align:start position:0%
impairment due to the consumption of
 
02:27:00.230 --> 02:27:00.240 align:start position:0%
alcohol I don't have to prove the o08
 
02:27:01.670 --> 02:27:01.680 align:start position:0%
o08 just makes it easier for me to get
 
02:27:03.630 --> 02:27:03.640 align:start position:0%
the conviction but I can proove you can
 
02:27:06.110 --> 02:27:06.120 align:start position:0%
prove it under an 08 so again even if we
 
02:27:08.510 --> 02:27:08.520 align:start position:0%
set a standard it doesn't mean that that
 
02:27:11.630 --> 02:27:11.640 align:start position:0%
standard is um an absolute conviction it
 
02:27:12.830 --> 02:27:12.840 align:start position:0%
just means that you would need
 
02:27:16.790 --> 02:27:16.800 align:start position:0%
additional facts to establish uh Pro
 
02:27:18.150 --> 02:27:18.160 align:start position:0%
Beyond A Reasonable Doubt a person was
 
02:27:19.790 --> 02:27:19.800 align:start position:0%
operating a vehicle Under the Influence
 
02:27:21.510 --> 02:27:21.520 align:start position:0%
that was caused by either marijuana or
 
02:27:23.309 --> 02:27:23.319 align:start position:0%
alcohol that would be correct that would
 
02:27:24.990 --> 02:27:25.000 align:start position:0%
be a you're discussing what I'm
 
02:27:28.510 --> 02:27:28.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:30.870 --> 02:27:30.880 align:start position:0%
case sorry I think we agree very much
 
02:27:32.990 --> 02:27:33.000 align:start position:0%
with you Senator that mean I think the
 
02:27:34.309 --> 02:27:34.319 align:start position:0%
science is pretty clear there is no
 
02:27:36.469 --> 02:27:36.479 align:start position:0%
number there's no magic number and so if
 
02:27:37.950 --> 02:27:37.960 align:start position:0%
we're trying to put something in there
 
02:27:40.150 --> 02:27:40.160 align:start position:0%
that's just going to be arbitrary um
 
02:27:41.790 --> 02:27:41.800 align:start position:0%
just because that's where the science
 
02:27:44.590 --> 02:27:44.600 align:start position:0%
currently is and so if if we invest in
 
02:27:47.429 --> 02:27:47.439 align:start position:0%
Dr if we give the Troopers and other law
 
02:27:49.510 --> 02:27:49.520 align:start position:0%
enforcement folks the tools they need to
 
02:27:50.910 --> 02:27:50.920 align:start position:0%
figure out you know to have the
 
02:27:53.230 --> 02:27:53.240 align:start position:0%
resources to do that totality analysis
 
02:27:55.110 --> 02:27:55.120 align:start position:0%
and then to bring that for prosecution I
 
02:27:57.429 --> 02:27:57.439 align:start position:0%
think that would be the way the best way
 
02:28:00.990 --> 02:28:01.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:03.230 --> 02:28:03.240 align:start position:0%
safe Jordan and then
 
02:28:06.670 --> 02:28:06.680 align:start position:0%
10 yes and you're talking about the
 
02:28:08.349 --> 02:28:08.359 align:start position:0%
totality of the circumstances an
 
02:28:11.349 --> 02:28:11.359 align:start position:0%
alcoholic of course can operate a motor
 
02:28:15.030 --> 02:28:15.040 align:start position:0%
vehicle way over the
 
02:28:17.630 --> 02:28:17.640 align:start position:0%
008 um
 
02:28:20.910 --> 02:28:20.920 align:start position:0%
limit successfully merely because of the
 
02:28:24.469 --> 02:28:24.479 align:start position:0%
body's adaptation to the alcohol level
 
02:28:27.710 --> 02:28:27.720 align:start position:0%
therein um there's a functional I think
 
02:28:29.389 --> 02:28:29.399 align:start position:0%
there's the phrase
 
02:28:31.830 --> 02:28:31.840 align:start position:0%
functional Behavior some of any IM
 
02:28:35.110 --> 02:28:35.120 align:start position:0%
material the same thing applies to the
 
02:28:37.830 --> 02:28:37.840 align:start position:0%
utilization of uh cannaboids or
 
02:28:39.790 --> 02:28:39.800 align:start position:0%
inhalation of uh
 
02:28:43.750 --> 02:28:43.760 align:start position:0%
cannaboids however I would hate to
 
02:28:48.469 --> 02:28:48.479 align:start position:0%
see some individual who had went to a
 
02:28:52.269 --> 02:28:52.279 align:start position:0%
party three weeks ago be hit up with a
 
02:28:54.190 --> 02:28:54.200 align:start position:0%
prime facia case because he was paying
 
02:28:56.389 --> 02:28:56.399 align:start position:0%
in attention because he was drinking
 
02:28:58.469 --> 02:28:58.479 align:start position:0%
while driving but the drinking was
 
02:29:01.110 --> 02:29:01.120 align:start position:0%
coffee and he spilled his coffee and
 
02:29:03.230 --> 02:29:03.240 align:start position:0%
went over the yellow line
 
02:29:06.510 --> 02:29:06.520 align:start position:0%
and something we have to take consider
 
02:29:08.590 --> 02:29:08.600 align:start position:0%
understood again that goes back to the
 
02:29:11.150 --> 02:29:11.160 align:start position:0%
totality of circumstances right so again
 
02:29:13.750 --> 02:29:13.760 align:start position:0%
when you get in the court if he is
 
02:29:15.590 --> 02:29:15.600 align:start position:0%
covered in coffee and and the officer
 
02:29:17.309 --> 02:29:17.319 align:start position:0%
says yeah well he was covering cofy when
 
02:29:18.710 --> 02:29:18.720 align:start position:0%
I pulled him over and I said he spilled
 
02:29:21.870 --> 02:29:21.880 align:start position:0%
it but I I could I I asked him anyway
 
02:29:23.429 --> 02:29:23.439 align:start position:0%
you're going to lose your case right so
 
02:29:25.910 --> 02:29:25.920 align:start position:0%
the judge is going to throw it out so
 
02:29:27.269 --> 02:29:27.279 align:start position:0%
again it has you have to be able to
 
02:29:29.030 --> 02:29:29.040 align:start position:0%
prove impairment the impairment is
 
02:29:32.070 --> 02:29:32.080 align:start position:0%
caused by the consumption of alcohol or
 
02:29:34.630 --> 02:29:34.640 align:start position:0%
marijuana thank you Mr chair actually I
 
02:29:36.349 --> 02:29:36.359 align:start position:0%
just wanted to say that the the best way
 
02:29:37.710 --> 02:29:37.720 align:start position:0%
to protect our streets is to not
 
02:29:39.990 --> 02:29:40.000 align:start position:0%
legalize weed in the first place and and
 
02:29:41.550 --> 02:29:41.560 align:start position:0%
I'm really I'm really glad to hear my
 
02:29:42.910 --> 02:29:42.920 align:start position:0%
colleague say that you know he's
 
02:29:44.550 --> 02:29:44.560 align:start position:0%
mentioning someone going to a party and
 
02:29:46.550 --> 02:29:46.560 align:start position:0%
getting and and and then maybe getting
 
02:29:49.150 --> 02:29:49.160 align:start position:0%
tested weeks later isn't that true for
 
02:29:50.830 --> 02:29:50.840 align:start position:0%
isn't that why we should not even
 
02:29:53.630 --> 02:29:53.640 align:start position:0%
remotely allow public smoking cuz then
 
02:29:57.469 --> 02:29:57.479 align:start position:0%
we we could be hit up for an oui or a
 
02:30:01.670 --> 02:30:01.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:04.830 --> 02:30:04.840 align:start position:0%
smoking all Mr chairman chief mikica
 
02:30:06.790 --> 02:30:06.800 align:start position:0%
first and then we'll come over here I
 
02:30:08.990 --> 02:30:09.000 align:start position:0%
mean commissioner M okay Mr chairman I
 
02:30:11.230 --> 02:30:11.240 align:start position:0%
would just ask that the chief be allowed
 
02:30:12.910 --> 02:30:12.920 align:start position:0%
to come back he has the answer of the
 
02:30:15.429 --> 02:30:15.439 align:start position:0%
original question okay thank
 
02:30:15.439 --> 02:30:19.469 align:start position:0%
original question okay thank
you

02:30:19.469 --> 02:30:19.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:22.150 --> 02:30:22.160 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman mik thank you Senator
 
02:30:25.429 --> 02:30:25.439 align:start position:0%
chairman um thank you for the two
 
02:30:27.910 --> 02:30:27.920 align:start position:0%
minutes it looked very familiar to me
 
02:30:29.790 --> 02:30:29.800 align:start position:0%
when I saw it I mentioned to Chairman
 
02:30:33.590 --> 02:30:33.600 align:start position:0%
mik when I walked away um this is the
 
02:30:38.670 --> 02:30:38.680 align:start position:0%
same verbage that we have in title 13 um
 
02:30:41.910 --> 02:30:41.920 align:start position:0%
as I researched it it looks like it's uh
 
02:30:45.830 --> 02:30:45.840 align:start position:0%
under 179 uh one second we're going back
 
02:30:47.230 --> 02:30:47.240 align:start position:0%
to number 17
 
02:30:48.550 --> 02:30:48.560 align:start position:0%
I think you're you're going back to we
 
02:30:49.870 --> 02:30:49.880 align:start position:0%
were talking about enforcement activity
 
02:30:51.269 --> 02:30:51.279 align:start position:0%
and verifying non
 
02:30:53.349 --> 02:30:53.359 align:start position:0%
compliance yeah page
 
02:30:56.150 --> 02:30:56.160 align:start position:0%
237 so just so everyone knows what we're
 
02:30:58.070 --> 02:30:58.080 align:start position:0%
talking about because we kind of jump
 
02:31:00.750 --> 02:31:00.760 align:start position:0%
subjects good I'm sorry good no my fault
 
02:31:05.790 --> 02:31:05.800 align:start position:0%
sir um so uh on the C on the uh title 13
 
02:31:08.030 --> 02:31:08.040 align:start position:0%
side of the house um we're looking at
 
02:31:13.349 --> 02:31:13.359 align:start position:0%
that in 179 colon 5 uh dasb which is
 
02:31:15.349 --> 02:31:15.359 align:start position:0%
enforcement activity verifying
 
02:31:17.510 --> 02:31:17.520 align:start position:0%
non-compliance you're absolutely right
 
02:31:19.469 --> 02:31:19.479 align:start position:0%
in the direction that you were going in
 
02:31:24.030 --> 02:31:24.040 align:start position:0%
Senator um what uh the legislature did
 
02:31:27.110 --> 02:31:27.120 align:start position:0%
um uh some time ago is separate these
 
02:31:29.790 --> 02:31:29.800 align:start position:0%
two entities so an
 
02:31:32.750 --> 02:31:32.760 align:start position:0%
investigation that has non-compliance in
 
02:31:35.469 --> 02:31:35.479 align:start position:0%
it is a misdemeanor but if we are
 
02:31:38.630 --> 02:31:38.640 align:start position:0%
actively going out with uh an underage
 
02:31:41.950 --> 02:31:41.960 align:start position:0%
buyer uh to do compliance checks it's a
 
02:31:45.070 --> 02:31:45.080 align:start position:0%
violation so they they have separated
 
02:31:47.349 --> 02:31:47.359 align:start position:0%
those two it it was straight across the
 
02:31:50.070 --> 02:31:50.080 align:start position:0%
board uh Miss meanor now it's a
 
02:31:52.110 --> 02:31:52.120 align:start position:0%
violation for that and then they would
 
02:31:55.870 --> 02:31:55.880 align:start position:0%
jump into internally under rule our
 
02:31:57.870 --> 02:31:57.880 align:start position:0%
Progressive accountability starting with
 
02:32:00.469 --> 02:32:00.479 align:start position:0%
education working their way up through
 
02:32:02.269 --> 02:32:02.279 align:start position:0%
okay so I I think what you talked about
 
02:32:05.230 --> 02:32:05.240 align:start position:0%
is again one is an an enforcement action
 
02:32:07.510 --> 02:32:07.520 align:start position:0%
second one is there's a car accident
 
02:32:09.429 --> 02:32:09.439 align:start position:0%
alcohol in the car miners involved
 
02:32:11.750 --> 02:32:11.760 align:start position:0%
receipt from a local store they follow
 
02:32:13.830 --> 02:32:13.840 align:start position:0%
it up find out that the store sold the
 
02:32:15.910 --> 02:32:15.920 align:start position:0%
minor liquor that would be a misdemeanor
 
02:32:18.269 --> 02:32:18.279 align:start position:0%
level of ense whereas your um
 
02:32:19.790 --> 02:32:19.800 align:start position:0%
enforcement activity would be considered
 
02:32:23.070 --> 02:32:23.080 align:start position:0%
a violation level off absolutely spot
 
02:32:26.990 --> 02:32:27.000 align:start position:0%
on thank you Chief thank you all right
 
02:32:28.910 --> 02:32:28.920 align:start position:0%
back to our 265a conversation have a
 
02:32:30.950 --> 02:32:30.960 align:start position:0%
question oh yeah good yes I have a
 
02:32:33.510 --> 02:32:33.520 align:start position:0%
question of Dr youngren um I think I
 
02:32:35.150 --> 02:32:35.160 align:start position:0%
heard you say that there's no
 
02:32:37.750 --> 02:32:37.760 align:start position:0%
correlation with impairment and THC
 
02:32:40.870 --> 02:32:40.880 align:start position:0%
levels in the blood is that correct
 
02:32:45.510 --> 02:32:45.520 align:start position:0%
correct I'm happy in so the degree of
 
02:32:45.520 --> 02:32:51.670 align:start position:0%
correct I'm happy in so the degree of
intoxication

02:32:51.670 --> 02:32:51.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:55.630 --> 02:32:55.640 align:start position:0%
theing that for do not throw canvas at
 
02:32:57.429 --> 02:32:57.439 align:start position:0%
all then it could
 
02:33:00.230 --> 02:33:00.240 align:start position:0%
be1 and I could be intoxicated where if
 
02:33:02.870 --> 02:33:02.880 align:start position:0%
you're a chronic user um you know some
 
02:33:04.950 --> 02:33:04.960 align:start position:0%
of this data is showing that after 24
 
02:33:07.349 --> 02:33:07.359 align:start position:0%
hours from smoking some people still had
 
02:33:10.790 --> 02:33:10.800 align:start position:0%
13 nanograms from
 
02:33:14.190 --> 02:33:14.200 align:start position:0%
care okay um I'm just trying to
 
02:33:15.990 --> 02:33:16.000 align:start position:0%
comprehend this because I I think we
 
02:33:18.349 --> 02:33:18.359 align:start position:0%
heard testimony from a child
 
02:33:20.910 --> 02:33:20.920 align:start position:0%
psychologist a psychiatrists from Boston
 
02:33:23.269 --> 02:33:23.279 align:start position:0%
Children's and and a
 
02:33:26.710 --> 02:33:26.720 align:start position:0%
neuroscientist that are relating uh THC
 
02:33:28.950 --> 02:33:28.960 align:start position:0%
levels with tri the triggering of
 
02:33:31.790 --> 02:33:31.800 align:start position:0%
psychosis so if we C if we have science
 
02:33:33.950 --> 02:33:33.960 align:start position:0%
behind that I'm just wondering what the
 
02:33:36.309 --> 02:33:36.319 align:start position:0%
measurements I mean what what can we do
 
02:33:40.349 --> 02:33:40.359 align:start position:0%
to be able to pinpoint this yeah I think
 
02:33:42.990 --> 02:33:43.000 align:start position:0%
I I I'm certainly not an expert on that
 
02:33:44.910 --> 02:33:44.920 align:start position:0%
but I would say it's really I mean
 
02:33:46.590 --> 02:33:46.600 align:start position:0%
clearly the literature shows it's really
 
02:33:49.030 --> 02:33:49.040 align:start position:0%
challenging that there's the need to
 
02:33:51.030 --> 02:33:51.040 align:start position:0%
enforce the law and make sure that our
 
02:33:53.710 --> 02:33:53.720 align:start position:0%
you know children are safe the there's
 
02:33:56.750 --> 02:33:56.760 align:start position:0%
Public Safety for driving but that
 
02:33:58.870 --> 02:33:58.880 align:start position:0%
depending on if you're a naive user or a
 
02:34:02.349 --> 02:34:02.359 align:start position:0%
chronic user the level of which your THC
 
02:34:03.550 --> 02:34:03.560 align:start position:0%
would be in the blood to show
 
02:34:05.309 --> 02:34:05.319 align:start position:0%
intoxication would be extremely
 
02:34:08.030 --> 02:34:08.040 align:start position:0%
different and so you know even Below in
 
02:34:10.590 --> 02:34:10.600 align:start position:0%
theory below the point 2 level for an or
 
02:34:11.910 --> 02:34:11.920 align:start position:0%
the I'm sorry the two nanograms per
 
02:34:13.630 --> 02:34:13.640 align:start position:0%
milliliter you may be intoxicated if
 
02:34:15.309 --> 02:34:15.319 align:start position:0%
you've never used before but at the much
 
02:34:16.630 --> 02:34:16.640 align:start position:0%
higher level you may not if you're a
 
02:34:19.030 --> 02:34:19.040 align:start position:0%
chronic user yes I understand that
 
02:34:22.870 --> 02:34:22.880 align:start position:0%
tolerance um I'm just I'm just trying to
 
02:34:26.230 --> 02:34:26.240 align:start position:0%
wrap my brain around um in the news just
 
02:34:29.510 --> 02:34:29.520 align:start position:0%
uh this week the the state trooper that
 
02:34:33.309 --> 02:34:33.319 align:start position:0%
was killed by uh the and the um the
 
02:34:36.830 --> 02:34:36.840 align:start position:0%
driver of the truck plad guilty his uh
 
02:34:40.990 --> 02:34:41.000 align:start position:0%
blood levels were 224 with with cannabis
 
02:34:44.389 --> 02:34:44.399 align:start position:0%
uh THC impairment so I'm just curious so
 
02:34:46.790 --> 02:34:46.800 align:start position:0%
we we don't have any cut off I I
 
02:34:49.670 --> 02:34:49.680 align:start position:0%
understand that between the point 0.008
 
02:34:54.190 --> 02:34:54.200 align:start position:0%
with alcohol but a0 224 sounds pretty
 
02:34:57.030 --> 02:34:57.040 align:start position:0%
serious to me and and a life was lost as
 
02:35:00.389 --> 02:35:00.399 align:start position:0%
a result of that so how are we why are
 
02:35:02.110 --> 02:35:02.120 align:start position:0%
we considering
 
02:35:05.190 --> 02:35:05.200 align:start position:0%
legalizing um you know Mar marijuana
 
02:35:06.870 --> 02:35:06.880 align:start position:0%
cannabis whatever you call it when we
 
02:35:10.230 --> 02:35:10.240 align:start position:0%
don't have the in the measurements um
 
02:35:13.790 --> 02:35:13.800 align:start position:0%
for uh intoxication and and impairment I
 
02:35:14.950 --> 02:35:14.960 align:start position:0%
mean I think that's a very different
 
02:35:16.870 --> 02:35:16.880 align:start position:0%
conversation than the one we're having
 
02:35:18.910 --> 02:35:18.920 align:start position:0%
today I understand your concerned for
 
02:35:21.269 --> 02:35:21.279 align:start position:0%
sure um I I don't know what a point 22
 
02:35:24.230 --> 02:35:24.240 align:start position:0%
is I think all of the literature that
 
02:35:25.670 --> 02:35:25.680 align:start position:0%
yeah I don't even know what that I mean
 
02:35:27.389 --> 02:35:27.399 align:start position:0%
that's you know all of the things that
 
02:35:29.550 --> 02:35:29.560 align:start position:0%
I've seen in terms of you know even from
 
02:35:31.230 --> 02:35:31.240 align:start position:0%
the you know accident analysis and
 
02:35:32.790 --> 02:35:32.800 align:start position:0%
prevent prevention journals like
 
02:35:36.190 --> 02:35:36.200 align:start position:0%
everything is uh is two is nanograms per
 
02:35:37.750 --> 02:35:37.760 align:start position:0%
milliliter and that's that's a whole
 
02:35:40.190 --> 02:35:40.200 align:start position:0%
digit so I I mean I can't really say you
 
02:35:42.269 --> 02:35:42.279 align:start position:0%
know anything if you told me it was like
 
02:35:44.710 --> 02:35:44.720 align:start position:0%
150 nanograms per millit like probably
 
02:35:46.389 --> 02:35:46.399 align:start position:0%
any person would be intoxicated with
 
02:35:49.150 --> 02:35:49.160 align:start position:0%
that um but the a two versus a five
 
02:35:52.269 --> 02:35:52.279 align:start position:0%
versus a 15 I I think it's really it's
 
02:35:53.110 --> 02:35:53.120 align:start position:0%
really hard
 
02:35:55.429 --> 02:35:55.439 align:start position:0%
toit what I recommend is everybody can
 
02:35:56.550 --> 02:35:56.560 align:start position:0%
go home and do a little bit of research
 
02:35:57.990 --> 02:35:58.000 align:start position:0%
you know just simply I'm looking at the
 
02:36:00.110 --> 02:36:00.120 align:start position:0%
National Institute of Health has one and
 
02:36:01.550 --> 02:36:01.560 align:start position:0%
they have one clear statement in it say
 
02:36:03.630 --> 02:36:03.640 align:start position:0%
furthermore drivers with a blood THC
 
02:36:06.269 --> 02:36:06.279 align:start position:0%
concentration of three milligram three
 
02:36:07.870 --> 02:36:07.880 align:start position:0%
nanograms per milliliter had an
 
02:36:10.110 --> 02:36:10.120 align:start position:0%
increased risk for being judged impaired
 
02:36:11.870 --> 02:36:11.880 align:start position:0%
as compared to drivers with lower
 
02:36:14.030 --> 02:36:14.040 align:start position:0%
concentrations so that seemed to be the
 
02:36:16.790 --> 02:36:16.800 align:start position:0%
break point of if you below this more
 
02:36:17.750 --> 02:36:17.760 align:start position:0%
likely you're not going to be found
 
02:36:19.190 --> 02:36:19.200 align:start position:0%
impaired but if you're above this you
 
02:36:21.190 --> 02:36:21.200 align:start position:0%
are going to be found impaired so and
 
02:36:22.590 --> 02:36:22.600 align:start position:0%
that's the National Institute of Health
 
02:36:26.110 --> 02:36:26.120 align:start position:0%
statement on 30,000 with 30,000 U
 
02:36:27.510 --> 02:36:27.520 align:start position:0%
participants in the study what you're
 
02:36:29.750 --> 02:36:29.760 align:start position:0%
saying contradicts what doctor just said
 
02:36:31.950 --> 02:36:31.960 align:start position:0%
because there that that is there is a
 
02:36:34.030 --> 02:36:34.040 align:start position:0%
correlation with impairment so but I
 
02:36:36.790 --> 02:36:36.800 align:start position:0%
think but I also to representative or's
 
02:36:39.269 --> 02:36:39.279 align:start position:0%
Point yeah right High consumers are
 
02:36:41.510 --> 02:36:41.520 align:start position:0%
going to have a natural level that may
 
02:36:43.389 --> 02:36:43.399 align:start position:0%
not relate correlate directly to
 
02:36:46.110 --> 02:36:46.120 align:start position:0%
impairment right because they they
 
02:36:48.550 --> 02:36:48.560 align:start position:0%
consume on a more regular basis right so
 
02:36:50.150 --> 02:36:50.160 align:start position:0%
Mr chair
 
02:36:54.190 --> 02:36:54.200 align:start position:0%
yes our current um our current laws
 
02:36:56.070 --> 02:36:56.080 align:start position:0%
regarding driving while intoxicated
 
02:36:57.790 --> 02:36:57.800 align:start position:0%
include prescription
 
02:37:02.389 --> 02:37:02.399 align:start position:0%
drugs and again the uh the level of uh I
 
02:37:04.870 --> 02:37:04.880 align:start position:0%
there's a board that talks about uh the
 
02:37:07.349 --> 02:37:07.359 align:start position:0%
ability of a person to have
 
02:37:09.550 --> 02:37:09.560 align:start position:0%
drugs within their system and still
 
02:37:11.389 --> 02:37:11.399 align:start position:0%
function I can't remember what it is
 
02:37:14.910 --> 02:37:14.920 align:start position:0%
right now uh applies you can have a
 
02:37:17.510 --> 02:37:17.520 align:start position:0%
person on valum driving into a telephone
 
02:37:20.790 --> 02:37:20.800 align:start position:0%
pole they're driving while
 
02:37:22.990 --> 02:37:23.000 align:start position:0%
intoxicated and it could be a very small
 
02:37:24.590 --> 02:37:24.600 align:start position:0%
amount of valum because that's the first
 
02:37:26.510 --> 02:37:26.520 align:start position:0%
time they take it or it could be a very
 
02:37:28.830 --> 02:37:28.840 align:start position:0%
large amount of valum because they're
 
02:37:32.510 --> 02:37:32.520 align:start position:0%
tolerant of that so the the the
 
02:37:34.550 --> 02:37:34.560 align:start position:0%
phraseology of a prim officiate case
 
02:37:36.790 --> 02:37:36.800 align:start position:0%
depends upon the individual and we go
 
02:37:39.070 --> 02:37:39.080 align:start position:0%
back to the totality and that needs to
 
02:37:41.710 --> 02:37:41.720 align:start position:0%
be included so if you want to look it up
 
02:37:42.990 --> 02:37:43.000 align:start position:0%
I guess I recommend you go do the
 
02:37:44.550 --> 02:37:44.560 align:start position:0%
research like I said I I just did a
 
02:37:46.309 --> 02:37:46.319 align:start position:0%
quick quick search and I found Institute
 
02:37:48.230 --> 02:37:48.240 align:start position:0%
of Health's statement they they have
 
02:37:50.389 --> 02:37:50.399 align:start position:0%
kind of this is the Tipping Point level
 
02:37:52.269 --> 02:37:52.279 align:start position:0%
right I don't know what that means for
 
02:37:53.790 --> 02:37:53.800 align:start position:0%
our statute but there that's what they
 
02:37:55.590 --> 02:37:55.600 align:start position:0%
have as a there as a Tipping Point level
 
02:37:59.469 --> 02:37:59.479 align:start position:0%
for impairment um with that I am Frank
 
02:38:01.510 --> 02:38:01.520 align:start position:0%
go ahead U Mr CH yeah I think also if
 
02:38:04.630 --> 02:38:04.640 align:start position:0%
it's helpful so the triaa um Foundation
 
02:38:06.910 --> 02:38:06.920 align:start position:0%
of for Traffic Safety also did a report
 
02:38:08.309 --> 02:38:08.319 align:start position:0%
and they found quote there's no
 
02:38:11.030 --> 02:38:11.040 align:start position:0%
correlation or no concentration of th
 
02:38:13.670 --> 02:38:13.680 align:start position:0%
that allows us to reli reliably predict
 
02:38:15.030 --> 02:38:15.040 align:start position:0%
that someone is impaired behind the
 
02:38:17.269 --> 02:38:17.279 align:start position:0%
wheel um in a way that we can with
 
02:38:20.230 --> 02:38:20.240 align:start position:0%
alcohol so just additional information
 
02:38:22.830 --> 02:38:22.840 align:start position:0%
helpful right so here's scoop I have to
 
02:38:25.670 --> 02:38:25.680 align:start position:0%
leave I'm going to Florida um I have a
 
02:38:27.990 --> 02:38:28.000 align:start position:0%
tax policy to go to so uh Senator
 
02:38:29.230 --> 02:38:29.240 align:start position:0%
Whitley is going to take over the rest
 
02:38:32.349 --> 02:38:32.359 align:start position:0%
of the meeting um we are at um
 
02:38:34.469 --> 02:38:34.479 align:start position:0%
enforcement of contracts did I actually
 
02:38:36.150 --> 02:38:36.160 align:start position:0%
use my copy and keep notes on here got
 
02:38:37.550 --> 02:38:37.560 align:start position:0%
it actually I do want to just have one
 
02:38:38.910 --> 02:38:38.920 align:start position:0%
comment so I'm not going to be here for
 
02:38:41.950 --> 02:38:41.960 align:start position:0%
it when you're talking about F20 um the
 
02:38:44.510 --> 02:38:44.520 align:start position:0%
next one I want you to consider there's
 
02:38:46.950 --> 02:38:46.960 align:start position:0%
some concerns I have have around
 
02:38:46.960 --> 02:38:48.349 align:start position:0%
some concerns I have have around
licensed

02:38:48.349 --> 02:38:48.359 align:start position:0%
licensed
 
02:38:51.750 --> 02:38:51.760 align:start position:0%
occupations um in this state and this is
 
02:38:54.269 --> 02:38:54.279 align:start position:0%
trying to do non-discriminatory language
 
02:38:56.510 --> 02:38:56.520 align:start position:0%
for licensed occupations and I think we
 
02:38:57.830 --> 02:38:57.840 align:start position:0%
have to be careful because we have some
 
02:38:59.269 --> 02:38:59.279 align:start position:0%
federal requirements and federal
 
02:39:00.750 --> 02:39:00.760 align:start position:0%
guidelines we get stuck around you think
 
02:39:03.070 --> 02:39:03.080 align:start position:0%
about a CDL license and a CDL truck
 
02:39:05.590 --> 02:39:05.600 align:start position:0%
driver who gets popped for a who does a
 
02:39:08.230 --> 02:39:08.240 align:start position:0%
random drug testing gets popped for
 
02:39:10.429 --> 02:39:10.439 align:start position:0%
cannabis being in their system and gets
 
02:39:11.750 --> 02:39:11.760 align:start position:0%
fired but according to this they
 
02:39:12.710 --> 02:39:12.720 align:start position:0%
couldn't get
 
02:39:15.469 --> 02:39:15.479 align:start position:0%
fired and so we have some concerns you
 
02:39:17.990 --> 02:39:18.000 align:start position:0%
got have to we have to go through in 20
 
02:39:20.110 --> 02:39:20.120 align:start position:0%
to talk about occupations and
 
02:39:23.030 --> 02:39:23.040 align:start position:0%
occupational licensing nurses um you
 
02:39:25.429 --> 02:39:25.439 align:start position:0%
know there's another one police officers
 
02:39:27.030 --> 02:39:27.040 align:start position:0%
right these are some licenses and
 
02:39:29.230 --> 02:39:29.240 align:start position:0%
certifications we issue where we may
 
02:39:31.670 --> 02:39:31.680 align:start position:0%
want to say there's a zero tolerance in
 
02:39:35.910 --> 02:39:35.920 align:start position:0%
that but this language as I read 20 um
 
02:39:37.590 --> 02:39:37.600 align:start position:0%
doesn't allow for that it says you can't
 
02:39:39.070 --> 02:39:39.080 align:start position:0%
discriminate against anybody Who's
 
02:39:41.710 --> 02:39:41.720 align:start position:0%
acting in doing a a legal activity on
 
02:39:43.510 --> 02:39:43.520 align:start position:0%
that on that issue we actually might
 
02:39:45.910 --> 02:39:45.920 align:start position:0%
want opl the lawyer from oplc to to come
 
02:39:47.910 --> 02:39:47.920 align:start position:0%
in so don't you think yeah that's fine
 
02:39:49.150 --> 02:39:49.160 align:start position:0%
if you want to put it off and we can
 
02:39:51.630 --> 02:39:51.640 align:start position:0%
invite uh Lindsay and and group in I
 
02:39:52.990 --> 02:39:53.000 align:start position:0%
will do you want to have Dy do that for
 
02:39:54.830 --> 02:39:54.840 align:start position:0%
the next one but just I have some
 
02:39:57.190 --> 02:39:57.200 align:start position:0%
concerns around that myself on on Li
 
02:40:00.550 --> 02:40:00.560 align:start position:0%
licensed occupations so and with that
 
02:40:02.030 --> 02:40:02.040 align:start position:0%
the share's yours thank you very much
 
02:40:04.070 --> 02:40:04.080 align:start position:0%

02:40:06.309 --> 02:40:06.319 align:start position:0%
a break somewhere between 12 and 12:15
 
02:40:08.429 --> 02:40:08.439 align:start position:0%
Daryl will be here or sen abis will be

hold that issue of opl not hold it we'll
 
02:40:27.030 --> 02:40:27.040 align:start position:0%
we'll we'll get we'll get to it and I
 
02:40:28.429 --> 02:40:28.439 align:start position:0%
think we should have the lawyer from
 
02:40:32.309 --> 02:40:32.319 align:start position:0%
oplc talk so now we are on page
 
02:40:36.429 --> 02:40:36.439 align:start position:0%
24 section 19 enforcement of contracts
 
02:40:42.910 --> 02:40:42.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:46.910 --> 02:40:46.920 align:start position:0%
that seeing none oh uh Senator Lang did
 
02:40:48.590 --> 02:40:48.600 align:start position:0%
you want to leave your copy with
 
02:40:50.870 --> 02:40:50.880 align:start position:0%
me you keep it updated that's going to
 
02:40:53.429 --> 02:40:53.439 align:start position:0%
try the deadline
 
02:40:55.950 --> 02:40:55.960 align:start position:0%
yeah you just give it the daily he can
 
02:40:58.269 --> 02:40:58.279 align:start position:0%

02:41:00.269 --> 02:41:00.279 align:start position:0%
check it off if there's changes just
 
02:41:02.150 --> 02:41:02.160 align:start position:0%
whatever they
 
02:41:06.429 --> 02:41:06.439 align:start position:0%
okay okay seeing none on 19 moving on to
 
02:41:09.230 --> 02:41:09.240 align:start position:0%
section 20 non-discrimination for state
 
02:41:11.630 --> 02:41:11.640 align:start position:0%
legal cannabis activities and prior
 
02:41:15.030 --> 02:41:15.040 align:start position:0%
convictions I think will hold on the
 
02:41:17.790 --> 02:41:17.800 align:start position:0%
license conversation and daily will uh
 
02:41:20.550 --> 02:41:20.560 align:start position:0%
reach out to the lawyer I'm sorry the
 
02:41:22.469 --> 02:41:22.479 align:start position:0%
executive director of oplc Lindsey
 
02:41:24.950 --> 02:41:24.960 align:start position:0%
Courtney and maybe um have her come in
 
02:41:26.550 --> 02:41:26.560 align:start position:0%
and discuss this further with us but are
 
02:41:30.389 --> 02:41:30.399 align:start position:0%
there any other comments on Section 20
 
02:41:32.670 --> 02:41:32.680 align:start position:0%
starting on line
 
02:41:35.510 --> 02:41:35.520 align:start position:0%
26 just one comment Senator uh from the
 
02:41:37.110 --> 02:41:37.120 align:start position:0%
law enforcement
 
02:41:40.830 --> 02:41:40.840 align:start position:0%
perspective uh it it it throws this
 
02:41:44.110 --> 02:41:44.120 align:start position:0%
section is is so broad that uh with
 
02:41:45.950 --> 02:41:45.960 align:start position:0%
respect to certification
 
02:41:48.269 --> 02:41:48.279 align:start position:0%
and Licensing of police officers in the
 
02:41:50.070 --> 02:41:50.080 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire they would be in
 
02:41:51.630 --> 02:41:51.640 align:start position:0%
direct conflict with federal law with
 
02:41:55.150 --> 02:41:55.160 align:start position:0%
respect to Firearms right um also CDLs
 
02:41:58.070 --> 02:41:58.080 align:start position:0%
as the good Senator mentioned and N but
 
02:42:00.269 --> 02:42:00.279 align:start position:0%
certainly here with respect to our
 
02:42:01.910 --> 02:42:01.920 align:start position:0%
certification process in New Hampshire
 
02:42:04.269 --> 02:42:04.279 align:start position:0%
with respect to law enforcement officers
 
02:42:07.230 --> 02:42:07.240 align:start position:0%
uh that that has to be rectified right I
 
02:42:10.429 --> 02:42:10.439 align:start position:0%
think this section needs a lot of
 
02:42:13.150 --> 02:42:13.160 align:start position:0%
work I'm wondering actually if the
 
02:42:15.030 --> 02:42:15.040 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office wants to work
 
02:42:17.670 --> 02:42:17.680 align:start position:0%
with PLC on this section I think it
 
02:42:19.230 --> 02:42:19.240 align:start position:0%
needs a lot of work because there
 
02:42:21.469 --> 02:42:21.479 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of interaction with state
 
02:42:23.510 --> 02:42:23.520 align:start position:0%
and federal law or would you be willing
 
02:42:25.349 --> 02:42:25.359 align:start position:0%
to do
 
02:42:27.349 --> 02:42:27.359 align:start position:0%
that I can I can note that and take a
 
02:42:29.309 --> 02:42:29.319 align:start position:0%
look at that okay thank
 
02:42:32.790 --> 02:42:32.800 align:start position:0%
you yeah yeah I just wanted to add you
 
02:42:35.309 --> 02:42:35.319 align:start position:0%
know that there's I'm carrying a couple
 
02:42:37.950 --> 02:42:37.960 align:start position:0%
licenses right here you know license to
 
02:42:39.870 --> 02:42:39.880 align:start position:0%
transport refrigeration and Ed
 
02:42:41.630 --> 02:42:41.640 align:start position:0%
Refrigeration you know those are those
 
02:42:44.950 --> 02:42:44.960 align:start position:0%
are federally governed yep and uh you
 
02:42:48.030 --> 02:42:48.040 align:start position:0%
definitely can't be smoking weed or
 
02:42:50.469 --> 02:42:50.479 align:start position:0%
using drugs while doing those things
 
02:42:52.190 --> 02:42:52.200 align:start position:0%
right there are yeah there are lots of
 
02:42:53.750 --> 02:42:53.760 align:start position:0%
other require I think this the section
 
02:42:53.760 --> 02:42:57.550 align:start position:0%
other require I think this the section
is

02:42:57.550 --> 02:42:57.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:59.950 --> 02:42:59.960 align:start position:0%
complicated any other comments so I
 
02:43:04.309 --> 02:43:04.319 align:start position:0%
think we're going to put a pin on
 
02:43:08.309 --> 02:43:08.319 align:start position:0%
um I and we'll have the AG and the oplc
 
02:43:12.110 --> 02:43:12.120 align:start position:0%
work with that same with
 
02:43:16.349 --> 02:43:16.359 align:start position:0%
two moving on to 25
 
02:43:16.359 --> 02:43:25.950 align:start position:0%
two moving on to 25
section

02:43:25.950 --> 02:43:25.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:28.670 --> 02:43:28.680 align:start position:0%
three seeing none moving on to section
 
02:43:37.110 --> 02:43:37.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:44.269 --> 02:43:44.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:44.279 --> 02:43:50.750 align:start position:0%
 
19

02:43:50.750 --> 02:43:50.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:54.429 --> 02:43:54.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:56.790 --> 02:43:56.800 align:start position:0%
to no I guess it's okay because it's
 
02:43:58.750 --> 02:43:58.760 align:start position:0%
only talk about entitlement or conduct
 
02:44:02.190 --> 02:44:02.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:07.790 --> 02:44:07.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:13.750 --> 02:44:13.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:16.469 --> 02:44:16.479 align:start position:0%
to uh maybe perhaps have a conversation
 
02:44:19.190 --> 02:44:19.200 align:start position:0%
with the director of DCF on this issue
 
02:44:24.030 --> 02:44:24.040 align:start position:0%
to make sure we are not um in any way
 
02:44:28.309 --> 02:44:28.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:30.790 --> 02:44:30.800 align:start position:0%
statute Madam chair yes if you're going
 
02:44:32.550 --> 02:44:32.560 align:start position:0%
to use the word unreasonable danger you
 
02:44:35.910 --> 02:44:35.920 align:start position:0%
have to um Define it what's
 
02:44:38.349 --> 02:44:38.359 align:start position:0%
unreasonable right and I and I think to
 
02:44:40.670 --> 02:44:40.680 align:start position:0%
that point
 
02:44:44.150 --> 02:44:44.160 align:start position:0%
uh we need to have DCA offway on
 
02:44:44.160 --> 02:44:57.469 align:start position:0%
uh we need to have DCA offway on
this

02:44:57.469 --> 02:44:57.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:00.950 --> 02:45:00.960 align:start position:0%
okay section
 
02:45:10.349 --> 02:45:10.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:10.359 --> 02:45:12.550 align:start position:0%
 
employment

02:45:12.550 --> 02:45:12.560 align:start position:0%
employment
 
02:45:18.990 --> 02:45:19.000 align:start position:0%
yes yes um if you have somebody that has
 
02:45:24.349 --> 02:45:24.359 align:start position:0%
that is using and um it's you they're
 
02:45:26.910 --> 02:45:26.920 align:start position:0%
going to work with children right are we
 
02:45:30.510 --> 02:45:30.520 align:start position:0%
then putting them you know the children
 
02:45:36.429 --> 02:45:36.439 align:start position:0%
and the uh employer in um Ham's Way by
 
02:45:38.750 --> 02:45:38.760 align:start position:0%
with this
 
02:45:41.030 --> 02:45:41.040 align:start position:0%
chapter discriminate in the hiring
 
02:45:43.269 --> 02:45:43.279 align:start position:0%
termination or anything right so I think
 
02:45:46.910 --> 02:45:46.920 align:start position:0%
we're I think
 
02:45:49.429 --> 02:45:49.439 align:start position:0%
I think there's a lot of um issues with
 
02:45:51.429 --> 02:45:51.439 align:start position:0%
this section because I I don't want to
 
02:45:54.750 --> 02:45:54.760 align:start position:0%
interfere with existing law and so I I
 
02:45:57.349 --> 02:45:57.359 align:start position:0%
want to
 
02:45:59.590 --> 02:45:59.600 align:start position:0%
actually touch base with the Attorney
 
02:46:01.469 --> 02:46:01.479 align:start position:0%
General's office on this issue and I
 
02:46:04.269 --> 02:46:04.279 align:start position:0%
think if you can come back to us with
 
02:46:06.190 --> 02:46:06.200 align:start position:0%
potentially some language because I feel
 
02:46:08.309 --> 02:46:08.319 align:start position:0%
like some of this may be unnecessary
 
02:46:13.269 --> 02:46:13.279 align:start position:0%
because of existing law um and I think
 
02:46:16.630 --> 02:46:16.640 align:start position:0%
we need to clean this up a lot actually
 
02:46:19.030 --> 02:46:19.040 align:start position:0%
because because employment there there
 
02:46:20.910 --> 02:46:20.920 align:start position:0%
you know there's a whole body of law
 
02:46:22.790 --> 02:46:22.800 align:start position:0%
around employment law and there's a
 
02:46:24.630 --> 02:46:24.640 align:start position:0%
whole body of law around child
 
02:46:26.750 --> 02:46:26.760 align:start position:0%
protection and I feel like this is
 
02:46:31.910 --> 02:46:31.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:35.429 --> 02:46:35.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:37.590 --> 02:46:37.600 align:start position:0%
agree yes this appears to touch large
 
02:46:39.550 --> 02:46:39.560 align:start position:0%
bodies of law
 
02:46:43.150 --> 02:46:43.160 align:start position:0%
Ed um I think I think we we need to come
 
02:46:47.750 --> 02:46:47.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:51.110 --> 02:46:51.120 align:start position:0%
like employee Child Protection you know
 
02:46:51.120 --> 02:46:53.550 align:start position:0%
like employee Child Protection you know
employment

02:46:53.550 --> 02:46:53.560 align:start position:0%
employment
 
02:46:55.349 --> 02:46:55.359 align:start position:0%
I I think the issue of
 
02:46:56.870 --> 02:46:56.880 align:start position:0%
non-discrimination is certainly
 
02:46:58.630 --> 02:46:58.640 align:start position:0%
important important but we don't want to
 
02:47:00.510 --> 02:47:00.520 align:start position:0%
interfere with existing
 
02:47:03.150 --> 02:47:03.160 align:start position:0%
law and you're referring to things like
 
02:47:06.030 --> 02:47:06.040 align:start position:0%
um um some financial institutions
 
02:47:09.510 --> 02:47:09.520 align:start position:0%
require drug testing Etc exactly and and
 
02:47:11.110 --> 02:47:11.120 align:start position:0%
like you know there with employment law
 
02:47:12.830 --> 02:47:12.840 align:start position:0%
we already have existing state statutes
 
02:47:15.590 --> 02:47:15.600 align:start position:0%
and common law I mean you know we need
 
02:47:17.030 --> 02:47:17.040 align:start position:0%
to make sure that's consistent in this
 
02:47:19.510 --> 02:47:19.520 align:start position:0%
and I don't you know I I'm not even sure
 
02:47:25.830 --> 02:47:25.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:27.750 --> 02:47:27.760 align:start position:0%
reference yeah thank you Senator I think
 
02:47:30.030 --> 02:47:30.040 align:start position:0%
the distinction should be between uh
 
02:47:32.309 --> 02:47:32.319 align:start position:0%
professional licensure and
 
02:47:34.510 --> 02:47:34.520 align:start position:0%
non-discrimination and that uh I think
 
02:47:36.429 --> 02:47:36.439 align:start position:0%
that's where some of the work that the
 
02:47:39.429 --> 02:47:39.439 align:start position:0%
AG and oplc needs to Y needs to work
 
02:47:40.790 --> 02:47:40.800 align:start position:0%
there I think that this whole section
 
02:47:44.389 --> 02:47:44.399 align:start position:0%
probably needs to be subject to further
 
02:47:48.030 --> 02:47:48.040 align:start position:0%
review I agree great just want to flag
 
02:47:51.190 --> 02:47:51.200 align:start position:0%
on Section seven sorry on line 37 it it
 
02:47:53.710 --> 02:47:53.720 align:start position:0%
clarifies that um it does not impact the
 
02:47:55.469 --> 02:47:55.479 align:start position:0%
ability of employee employers to
 
02:47:57.389 --> 02:47:57.399 align:start position:0%
discipline for engage in Canabis use
 
02:47:59.349 --> 02:47:59.359 align:start position:0%
while but also there's in the
 
02:48:02.670 --> 02:48:02.680 align:start position:0%
subsections there talks about um uh
 
02:48:04.830 --> 02:48:04.840 align:start position:0%
conflicts with federal law or any other
 
02:48:07.150 --> 02:48:07.160 align:start position:0%
um uring that there's no conflict of
 
02:48:07.160 --> 02:48:10.750 align:start position:0%
um uring that there's no conflict of
laws

02:48:10.750 --> 02:48:10.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:10.760 --> 02:48:12.910 align:start position:0%
 
there

02:48:12.910 --> 02:48:12.920 align:start position:0%
there
 
02:48:18.190 --> 02:48:18.200 align:start position:0%
y sureair yes uh a good phrase in in
 
02:48:20.590 --> 02:48:20.600 align:start position:0%
this section might be notwithstanding
 
02:48:23.150 --> 02:48:23.160 align:start position:0%
other Pro uh provisions of other laws
 
02:48:26.630 --> 02:48:26.640 align:start position:0%
exactly yep okay so we're going to come
 
02:48:27.910 --> 02:48:27.920 align:start position:0%
back to that we'll defer to the Attorney
 
02:48:29.550 --> 02:48:29.560 align:start position:0%
General's office because there's
 
02:48:31.510 --> 02:48:31.520 align:start position:0%
multiple bodies of law that we are
 
02:48:35.030 --> 02:48:35.040 align:start position:0%
engaging with in the in these sections
 
02:48:38.269 --> 02:48:38.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:42.230 --> 02:48:42.240 align:start position:0%
on to page
 
02:48:49.790 --> 02:48:49.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:54.550 --> 02:48:54.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:56.870 --> 02:48:56.880 align:start position:0%
thoughts I I think that there's a little
 
02:48:59.030 --> 02:48:59.040 align:start position:0%
challenge here put I mean again I am I'm
 
02:49:00.910 --> 02:49:00.920 align:start position:0%
not a transplant surgeon by any means
 
02:49:03.590 --> 02:49:03.600 align:start position:0%
but um and not so much around the use of
 
02:49:05.710 --> 02:49:05.720 align:start position:0%
the illicit substance but smoking I know
 
02:49:07.710 --> 02:49:07.720 align:start position:0%
that for certain organ transplants like
 
02:49:09.590 --> 02:49:09.600 align:start position:0%
a lung transplant you have to be
 
02:49:11.389 --> 02:49:11.399 align:start position:0%
abstinent from smoking for a certain
 
02:49:12.590 --> 02:49:12.600 align:start position:0%
amount of time just like you would for a
 
02:49:15.510 --> 02:49:15.520 align:start position:0%
liver transplant with alcohol so I
 
02:49:17.510 --> 02:49:17.520 align:start position:0%
I think that that's a little tricky it's
 
02:49:19.469 --> 02:49:19.479 align:start position:0%
um because it's not necessarily the act
 
02:49:21.110 --> 02:49:21.120 align:start position:0%
of the using the elicit substance as
 
02:49:24.349 --> 02:49:24.359 align:start position:0%
much as the root of uh uh in which
 
02:49:27.309 --> 02:49:27.319 align:start position:0%
you're taking it so
 
02:49:30.190 --> 02:49:30.200 align:start position:0%
um I think that that might be sticky for
 
02:49:30.200 --> 02:49:34.389 align:start position:0%
um I think that that might be sticky for
lung

02:49:34.389 --> 02:49:34.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:36.349 --> 02:49:36.359 align:start position:0%
transplant uh would the medical society
 
02:49:37.590 --> 02:49:37.600 align:start position:0%
like to come back to us with a
 
02:49:41.469 --> 02:49:41.479 align:start position:0%
recommendation on that yeah Frank I I so
 
02:49:42.670 --> 02:49:42.680 align:start position:0%
we were part of the Coalition I think
 
02:49:45.389 --> 02:49:45.399 align:start position:0%
this was from 639 um so I think we had
 
02:49:46.830 --> 02:49:46.840 align:start position:0%
tried so I definitely understand if
 
02:49:49.630 --> 02:49:49.640 align:start position:0%
there's changes that need to be made but
 
02:49:51.110 --> 02:49:51.120 align:start position:0%
uh it's like the definition of a listed
 
02:49:53.710 --> 02:49:53.720 align:start position:0%
substance it's trying to limit and then
 
02:49:55.389 --> 02:49:55.399 align:start position:0%
make sure that any decisions y all make
 
02:49:56.670 --> 02:49:56.680 align:start position:0%
it's just based on evidence-based
 
02:49:58.269 --> 02:49:58.279 align:start position:0%
criteria not just because someone
 
02:50:00.389 --> 02:50:00.399 align:start position:0%
happens to smoke marijuana yeah no
 
02:50:02.590 --> 02:50:02.600 align:start position:0%
definitely and I don't think that it
 
02:50:04.790 --> 02:50:04.800 align:start position:0%
would anyway I think Mor say saying like
 
02:50:07.910 --> 02:50:07.920 align:start position:0%
if smoking smoking sa is a criteria for
 
02:50:07.920 --> 02:50:13.630 align:start position:0%
if smoking smoking sa is a criteria for
transplant

02:50:13.630 --> 02:50:13.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:13.640 --> 02:50:19.510 align:start position:0%
 
that

02:50:19.510 --> 02:50:19.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:21.550 --> 02:50:21.560 align:start position:0%
um so you'll come back to us with a
 
02:50:23.389 --> 02:50:23.399 align:start position:0%
recommendation on that okay moving on to
 
02:50:25.550 --> 02:50:25.560 align:start position:0%
line 13 notwithstanding any other
 
02:50:26.950 --> 02:50:26.960 align:start position:0%
provisional law unless there is a
 
02:50:28.710 --> 02:50:28.720 align:start position:0%
specific finding that the individual's
 
02:50:30.229 --> 02:50:30.239 align:start position:0%
use cultivation or possession of
 
02:50:31.590 --> 02:50:31.600 align:start position:0%
cannabis could create a danger to the
 
02:50:33.070 --> 02:50:33.080 align:start position:0%
individual or another person it shall be
 
02:50:35.110 --> 02:50:35.120 align:start position:0%
a violation of conditions of parole
 
02:50:38.030 --> 02:50:38.040 align:start position:0%
probation or pre-trial release to engage
 
02:50:40.110 --> 02:50:40.120 align:start position:0%
in contact uh conduct Allowed by this
 
02:50:43.630 --> 02:50:43.640 align:start position:0%
chapter or test positive for cannabis
 
02:50:43.640 --> 02:50:52.510 align:start position:0%
chapter or test positive for cannabis
Etc

02:50:52.510 --> 02:50:52.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:54.870 --> 02:50:54.880 align:start position:0%
comments Senator Lang had a question
 
02:50:56.309 --> 02:50:56.319 align:start position:0%
about whether cultivation should be
 
02:51:02.830 --> 02:51:02.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:05.030 --> 02:51:05.040 align:start position:0%
this I mean I think our thought is that
 
02:51:06.710 --> 02:51:06.720 align:start position:0%
if people are engaged in employment this
 
02:51:08.910 --> 02:51:08.920 align:start position:0%
is all lawful cultivation under this
 
02:51:10.429 --> 02:51:10.439 align:start position:0%
chapter and so they should be able to do
 
02:51:12.190 --> 02:51:12.200 align:start position:0%
that unless there is some individualized
 
02:51:14.990 --> 02:51:15.000 align:start position:0%
basis that that there that they
 
02:51:19.710 --> 02:51:19.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:32.309 --> 02:51:32.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:32.319 --> 02:51:34.590 align:start position:0%
 
23

02:51:34.590 --> 02:51:34.600 align:start position:0%
23
 
02:51:37.950 --> 02:51:37.960 align:start position:0%
okay all right moving
 
02:51:41.630 --> 02:51:41.640 align:start position:0%
on uh data collection so we are page 26
 
02:51:44.190 --> 02:51:44.200 align:start position:0%
line 31 data collection related to
 
02:51:45.910 --> 02:51:45.920 align:start position:0%
cannabis legalization and regulation
 
02:51:50.190 --> 02:51:50.200 align:start position:0%
again this is language that came from HB
 
02:51:54.670 --> 02:51:54.680 align:start position:0%
639 I think um in this conversation the
 
02:51:56.150 --> 02:51:56.160 align:start position:0%
uh data collection has been a very
 
02:51:58.110 --> 02:51:58.120 align:start position:0%
important topic I think AC in the
 
02:52:04.110 --> 02:52:04.120 align:start position:0%
legislature r large um yes so um I I was
 
02:52:06.389 --> 02:52:06.399 align:start position:0%
just uh wanted to suggest that just
 
02:52:09.630 --> 02:52:09.640 align:start position:0%
throughout the the um a piece of
 
02:52:11.670 --> 02:52:11.680 align:start position:0%
legislation here that we're using
 
02:52:12.990 --> 02:52:13.000 align:start position:0%
substance use disorder instead of
 
02:52:14.750 --> 02:52:14.760 align:start position:0%
substance abuse or misuse just to be
 
02:52:16.229 --> 02:52:16.239 align:start position:0%
consistent with the current medical
 
02:52:18.469 --> 02:52:18.479 align:start position:0%
nomenclature and you know removing
 
02:52:22.030 --> 02:52:22.040 align:start position:0%
stigma um from the language so I mean I
 
02:52:23.309 --> 02:52:23.319 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to go through the document
 
02:52:24.550 --> 02:52:24.560 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of times where it says
 
02:52:26.469 --> 02:52:26.479 align:start position:0%
substance abuse but um so substance use
 
02:52:28.510 --> 02:52:28.520 align:start position:0%
disorder substance use disorder
 
02:52:30.190 --> 02:52:30.200 align:start position:0%
treatment prevention throughout the
 
02:52:31.670 --> 02:52:31.680 align:start position:0%
document if we can use substance use
 
02:52:34.630 --> 02:52:34.640 align:start position:0%
disorder in place of substance
 
02:52:43.429 --> 02:52:43.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:43.439 --> 02:52:52.190 align:start position:0%
 
flag

02:52:52.190 --> 02:52:52.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:55.469 --> 02:52:55.479 align:start position:0%
okay data collection any comments on the
 
02:52:57.349 --> 02:52:57.359 align:start position:0%
on the data collection
 
02:53:01.150 --> 02:53:01.160 align:start position:0%
Provisions in here yeah just a comment
 
02:53:05.070 --> 02:53:05.080 align:start position:0%
and that um that's going to be um um a
 
02:53:07.830 --> 02:53:07.840 align:start position:0%
cost factor for the agencies engage
 
02:53:09.190 --> 02:53:09.200 align:start position:0%
whether it's dep Department of Safety or
 
02:53:12.990 --> 02:53:13.000 align:start position:0%
others so um I'm not sure uh how to
 
02:53:14.950 --> 02:53:14.960 align:start position:0%
reflect that appropriately but
 
02:53:17.590 --> 02:53:17.600 align:start position:0%
uh uh there should be a revenue stream
 
02:53:18.750 --> 02:53:18.760 align:start position:0%
that should
 
02:53:22.070 --> 02:53:22.080 align:start position:0%
support uh data collection and Reporting
 
02:53:24.830 --> 02:53:24.840 align:start position:0%
otherwise it it could be very costly
 
02:53:27.190 --> 02:53:27.200 align:start position:0%
yeah so as Senator Lang mentioned 5% of
 
02:53:29.110 --> 02:53:29.120 align:start position:0%
revenues will be going to law
 
02:53:31.469 --> 02:53:31.479 align:start position:0%
enforcement for all you know for
 
02:53:37.590 --> 02:53:37.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:40.590 --> 02:53:40.600 align:start position:0%
statute mam chair yes should we include
 
02:53:43.550 --> 02:53:43.560 align:start position:0%
the cross in there that says uh non
 
02:53:43.560 --> 02:53:48.510 align:start position:0%
the cross in there that says uh non
identifiable

02:53:48.510 --> 02:53:48.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:51.349 --> 02:53:51.359 align:start position:0%
data non-personally
 
02:54:05.870 --> 02:54:05.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:09.710 --> 02:54:09.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:09.720 --> 02:54:13.269 align:start position:0%
 
identifi

02:54:13.269 --> 02:54:13.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:13.279 --> 02:54:19.389 align:start position:0%
 
yep

02:54:19.389 --> 02:54:19.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:25.710 --> 02:54:25.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:30.910 --> 02:54:30.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:35.030 --> 02:54:35.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:37.150 --> 02:54:37.160 align:start position:0%
individual I think there's language
 
02:54:39.510 --> 02:54:39.520 align:start position:0%
already in law regarding that just use
 
02:54:41.670 --> 02:54:41.680 align:start position:0%
you know OS has it
 
02:54:41.680 --> 02:54:43.269 align:start position:0%
you know OS has it
handy

02:54:43.269 --> 02:54:43.279 align:start position:0%
handy
 
02:54:43.279 --> 02:54:44.870 align:start position:0%
handy
okay

02:54:44.870 --> 02:54:44.880 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:54:49.469 --> 02:54:49.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:54.710 --> 02:54:54.720 align:start position:0%
collection okay moving on to page 27 the
 
02:54:54.720 --> 02:54:59.110 align:start position:0%
collection okay moving on to page 27 the
Cannabis

02:54:59.110 --> 02:54:59.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:03.429 --> 02:55:03.439 align:start position:0%
fund okay so la uh section one actually
 
02:55:08.349 --> 02:55:08.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:08.359 --> 02:55:10.190 align:start position:0%
 
fund

02:55:10.190 --> 02:55:10.200 align:start position:0%
fund
 
02:55:12.590 --> 02:55:12.600 align:start position:0%
yes so this is the section that I
 
02:55:14.389 --> 02:55:14.399 align:start position:0%
referred to at the beginning where it's
 
02:55:16.229 --> 02:55:16.239 align:start position:0%
kept separate and distinct just so this
 
02:55:17.910 --> 02:55:17.920 align:start position:0%
doesn't interrupt the current banking
 
02:55:19.830 --> 02:55:19.840 align:start position:0%
relationship the state has in the event
 
02:55:22.469 --> 02:55:22.479 align:start position:0%
that that bank doesn't want to engage
 
02:55:24.710 --> 02:55:24.720 align:start position:0%
and take and uh banking marijuana
 
02:55:26.710 --> 02:55:26.720 align:start position:0%
related businesses y um so that's just
 
02:55:29.550 --> 02:55:29.560 align:start position:0%
to protect that relationship okay and
 
02:55:30.910 --> 02:55:30.920 align:start position:0%
did you have language I'm sorry that you
 
02:55:33.070 --> 02:55:33.080 align:start position:0%
wanted the language is already in it's
 
02:55:35.269 --> 02:55:35.279 align:start position:0%
already in there y great thank
 
02:55:35.279 --> 02:55:39.110 align:start position:0%
already in there y great thank
you

02:55:39.110 --> 02:55:39.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:42.030 --> 02:55:42.040 align:start position:0%
okay section
 
02:55:45.190 --> 02:55:45.200 align:start position:0%
two shall include the cost of admin
 
02:55:48.670 --> 02:55:48.680 align:start position:0%
Administration section three to the
 
02:55:48.680 --> 02:55:50.110 align:start position:0%
Administration section three to the
Liquor

02:55:50.110 --> 02:55:50.120 align:start position:0%

02:55:52.030 --> 02:55:52.040 align:start position:0%

02:55:57.550 --> 02:55:57.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:59.860 --> 02:55:59.870 align:start position:0%
okay section
 
02:55:59.870 --> 02:56:01.030 align:start position:0%
okay section
[Music]

02:56:01.030 --> 02:56:01.040 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:56:03.190 --> 02:56:03.200 align:start position:0%
four substance use prevention and
 
02:56:03.200 --> 02:56:06.070 align:start position:0%
four substance use prevention and
Recovery

02:56:06.070 --> 02:56:06.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:10.190 --> 02:56:10.200 align:start position:0%
Fund yeah uh so I I think that it may be
 
02:56:11.830 --> 02:56:11.840 align:start position:0%
helpful to have some clarity about who
 
02:56:15.710 --> 02:56:15.720 align:start position:0%
is um who's framing the public education
 
02:56:18.229 --> 02:56:18.239 align:start position:0%
campaign you know if there was something
 
02:56:19.750 --> 02:56:19.760 align:start position:0%
um in the language about you know either
 
02:56:21.750 --> 02:56:21.760 align:start position:0%
having some medical expertise or
 
02:56:24.070 --> 02:56:24.080 align:start position:0%
involving of DHHS or public you know
 
02:56:27.309 --> 02:56:27.319 align:start position:0%
Public Safety um I think that would be
 
02:56:30.030 --> 02:56:30.040 align:start position:0%
helpful yeah and actually to that issue
 
02:56:34.950 --> 02:56:34.960 align:start position:0%
um we have in our uh Memo from new
 
02:56:37.630 --> 02:56:37.640 align:start position:0%
Futures they had some proposal for that
 
02:56:43.070 --> 02:56:43.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:44.870 --> 02:56:44.880 align:start position:0%
microphone just make sure you're
 
02:56:49.229 --> 02:56:49.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:51.469 --> 02:56:51.479 align:start position:0%
record thank you again for the record
 
02:56:53.349 --> 02:56:53.359 align:start position:0%
Kate fry vice president of advocacy at
 
02:56:55.910 --> 02:56:55.920 align:start position:0%
new Futures so uh this just section
 
02:56:57.670 --> 02:56:57.680 align:start position:0%
needs to be just cleaned up a little bit
 
02:57:00.670 --> 02:57:00.680 align:start position:0%
but to to be consistent with what we
 
02:57:03.269 --> 02:57:03.279 align:start position:0%
discussed already regarding the creation
 
02:57:04.190 --> 02:57:04.200 align:start position:0%
of the
 
02:57:06.750 --> 02:57:06.760 align:start position:0%
substance um Abuse Prevention treatment
 
02:57:08.950 --> 02:57:08.960 align:start position:0%
and Recovery Fund I'm certainly um fine
 
02:57:12.670 --> 02:57:12.680 align:start position:0%
with language substance use um disorder
 
02:57:15.429 --> 02:57:15.439 align:start position:0%
uh we've established that fund however
 
02:57:17.269 --> 02:57:17.279 align:start position:0%
when we go through the Appropriations in
 
02:57:20.830 --> 02:57:20.840 align:start position:0%
this section I think um if you look at
 
02:57:23.389 --> 02:57:23.399 align:start position:0%
uh page two of what we sent you um
 
02:57:23.399 --> 02:57:24.510 align:start position:0%
uh page two of what we sent you um
number

02:57:24.510 --> 02:57:24.520 align:start position:0%
number
 
02:57:28.750 --> 02:57:28.760 align:start position:0%
six um page uh we talk about the
 
02:57:30.950 --> 02:57:30.960 align:start position:0%
Cannabis control fund the dispersement
 
02:57:34.590 --> 02:57:34.600 align:start position:0%
of funds they're sending that funding to
 
02:57:34.600 --> 02:57:35.510 align:start position:0%
of funds they're sending that funding to
the

02:57:35.510 --> 02:57:35.520 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:57:37.309 --> 02:57:37.319 align:start position:0%
department I think that was in an
 
02:57:40.870 --> 02:57:40.880 align:start position:0%
earlier draft um where it really should
 
02:57:44.070 --> 02:57:44.080 align:start position:0%
be going to um the substance abuse
 
02:57:46.309 --> 02:57:46.319 align:start position:0%
prevention and Recovery Fund consistent
 
02:57:49.950 --> 02:57:49.960 align:start position:0%
with the language we discussed earlier
 
02:57:52.510 --> 02:57:52.520 align:start position:0%
um I put 10% in I know that percent
 
02:57:54.269 --> 02:57:54.279 align:start position:0%
might change just because that was one
 
02:57:56.630 --> 02:57:56.640 align:start position:0%
of the numbers that was offered and then
 
02:58:00.030 --> 02:58:00.040 align:start position:0%
to the doctor's point I would agree that
 
02:58:02.389 --> 02:58:02.399 align:start position:0%
um although there's an
 
02:58:05.229 --> 02:58:05.239 align:start position:0%
appropriation um it doesn't NE for a
 
02:58:07.630 --> 02:58:07.640 align:start position:0%
500,000 for a campaign it doesn't
 
02:58:09.670 --> 02:58:09.680 align:start position:0%
necessarily direct anyone to do the
 
02:58:12.309 --> 02:58:12.319 align:start position:0%
campaign right so it is missing language
 
02:58:14.269 --> 02:58:14.279 align:start position:0%
to direct the department to do that
 
02:58:17.150 --> 02:58:17.160 align:start position:0%
campaign and that's in um under number
 
02:58:19.309 --> 02:58:19.319 align:start position:0%
nine in our document on page three
 
02:58:22.670 --> 02:58:22.680 align:start position:0%
there's language that um addresses that
 
02:58:24.750 --> 02:58:24.760 align:start position:0%
does everyone have this Memo from new
 
02:58:30.269 --> 02:58:30.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:33.389 --> 02:58:33.399 align:start position:0%
language so so we're looking at new
 
02:58:36.670 --> 02:58:36.680 align:start position:0%
Futures memo number nine where they make
 
02:58:36.680 --> 02:58:38.389 align:start position:0%
Futures memo number nine where they make
a

02:58:38.389 --> 02:58:38.399 align:start position:0%
a
 
02:58:40.870 --> 02:58:40.880 align:start position:0%
recommendation about the direction of
 
02:58:42.590 --> 02:58:42.600 align:start position:0%
the appropriation and I think that makes
 
02:58:45.110 --> 02:58:45.120 align:start position:0%
a lot of sense
 
02:58:48.229 --> 02:58:48.239 align:start position:0%
do that address your concern yes
 
02:58:51.110 --> 02:58:51.120 align:start position:0%
okay good and then under num number six
 
02:58:52.870 --> 02:58:52.880 align:start position:0%
it just clarifies that the funds aren't
 
02:58:54.630 --> 02:58:54.640 align:start position:0%
going to the department directly they're
 
02:58:57.670 --> 02:58:57.680 align:start position:0%
going to the Substance Abuse Prevention
 
02:58:59.870 --> 02:58:59.880 align:start position:0%
and Recovery Fund so just I think it
 
02:59:02.070 --> 02:59:02.080 align:start position:0%
combined two or three different bills so
 
02:59:06.229 --> 02:59:06.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:08.870 --> 02:59:08.880 align:start position:0%
you that makes a lot of sense to
 
02:59:12.830 --> 02:59:12.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:12.840 --> 02:59:14.830 align:start position:0%
 
you

02:59:14.830 --> 02:59:14.840 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:59:16.110 --> 02:59:16.120 align:start position:0%
actually I'm sorry Kate will you come
 
02:59:24.590 --> 02:59:24.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:28.750 --> 02:59:28.760 align:start position:0%
topic so after your
 
02:59:33.229 --> 02:59:33.239 align:start position:0%
discussion uh in number 10 you recommend
 
02:59:36.110 --> 02:59:36.120 align:start position:0%
new Futures recommended the addition of
 
02:59:38.469 --> 02:59:38.479 align:start position:0%
new language to create adjustment uh a
 
02:59:40.229 --> 02:59:40.239 align:start position:0%
Justice reinvestment fund to support
 
02:59:42.269 --> 02:59:42.279 align:start position:0%
communities individuals can you discuss
 
02:59:44.269 --> 02:59:44.279 align:start position:0%
that yes thank you for uh bringing that
 
02:59:46.229 --> 02:59:46.239 align:start position:0%
up and reminding me of this piece so
 
02:59:50.710 --> 02:59:50.720 align:start position:0%
this was um originally in a draft of the
 
02:59:54.950 --> 02:59:54.960 align:start position:0%
bill uh of HB 639 it never made it to
 
02:59:58.030 --> 02:59:58.040 align:start position:0%
print um but this was something that I
 
03:00:01.590 --> 03:00:01.600 align:start position:0%
thought had a lot of support with um the
 
03:00:04.309 --> 03:00:04.319 align:start position:0%
uh proide people who cared about social
 
03:00:07.510 --> 03:00:07.520 align:start position:0%
justice we one of our principles is
 
03:00:10.309 --> 03:00:10.319 align:start position:0%
around social justice and uh what we
 
03:00:13.269 --> 03:00:13.279 align:start position:0%
have learned lessons from other states
 
03:00:16.190 --> 03:00:16.200 align:start position:0%
um and so one of the recommendations was
 
03:00:19.190 --> 03:00:19.200 align:start position:0%
to create a Justice reinvestment fund to
 
03:00:23.070 --> 03:00:23.080 align:start position:0%
do um look at the issues um below we
 
03:00:25.630 --> 03:00:25.640 align:start position:0%
know a lot of times when we talk about
 
03:00:28.070 --> 03:00:28.080 align:start position:0%
commercializing addictive products what
 
03:00:30.309 --> 03:00:30.319 align:start position:0%
ends up happening is we end up
 
03:00:32.910 --> 03:00:32.920 align:start position:0%
revictimized the people who have been
 
03:00:35.670 --> 03:00:35.680 align:start position:0%
impacted by the war of on drugs so this
 
03:00:39.870 --> 03:00:39.880 align:start position:0%
was at one point a big um selling point
 
03:00:42.510 --> 03:00:42.520 align:start position:0%
for even the pro side I think uh the
 
03:00:44.550 --> 03:00:44.560 align:start position:0%
Coalition that had been working
 
03:00:46.070 --> 03:00:46.080 align:start position:0%
um on the bill had at one point
 
03:00:48.590 --> 03:00:48.600 align:start position:0%
supported it but uh it seems to kind of
 
03:00:51.070 --> 03:00:51.080 align:start position:0%
Fallen by the wayside I know the ACLU
 
03:00:56.510 --> 03:00:56.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:58.990 --> 03:00:59.000 align:start position:0%
well I will I will say from my
 
03:01:00.550 --> 03:01:00.560 align:start position:0%
perspective I think this is incredibly
 
03:01:02.630 --> 03:01:02.640 align:start position:0%
important piece you know one of the
 
03:01:06.590 --> 03:01:06.600 align:start position:0%
reasons why individuals and and in fact
 
03:01:08.870 --> 03:01:08.880 align:start position:0%
constituents and the community at large
 
03:01:11.990 --> 03:01:12.000 align:start position:0%
is uh in so in support of legalization
 
03:01:14.309 --> 03:01:14.319 align:start position:0%
is because the disproportion
 
03:01:17.269 --> 03:01:17.279 align:start position:0%
impact of prohibition on communities of
 
03:01:21.110 --> 03:01:21.120 align:start position:0%
color and um and those uh within the
 
03:01:24.469 --> 03:01:24.479 align:start position:0%
substance use community and so I feel
 
03:01:26.110 --> 03:01:26.120 align:start position:0%
like this is an important part of the
 
03:01:28.389 --> 03:01:28.399 align:start position:0%
conversation and I think without it we
 
03:01:29.870 --> 03:01:29.880 align:start position:0%
sort of have a
 
03:01:31.990 --> 03:01:32.000 align:start position:0%
lopsided approach in New Hampshire I
 
03:01:33.269 --> 03:01:33.279 align:start position:0%
think if we're going to be a leader in
 
03:01:36.110 --> 03:01:36.120 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire um on taking a public
 
03:01:37.670 --> 03:01:37.680 align:start position:0%
health perspective I think it doesn't
 
03:01:39.469 --> 03:01:39.479 align:start position:0%
make sense not to have something like
 
03:01:42.790 --> 03:01:42.800 align:start position:0%
this I'm open to other comments as well
 
03:01:42.800 --> 03:01:44.469 align:start position:0%
this I'm open to other comments as well
yep

03:01:44.469 --> 03:01:44.479 align:start position:0%
yep
 
03:01:45.990 --> 03:01:46.000 align:start position:0%
um no as Kate said this is something
 
03:01:47.389 --> 03:01:47.399 align:start position:0%
that we have pursued and we think is
 
03:01:49.309 --> 03:01:49.319 align:start position:0%
really important so we would very much
 
03:01:51.070 --> 03:01:51.080 align:start position:0%
support the inclusion of this language
 
03:01:55.309 --> 03:01:55.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:57.750 --> 03:01:57.760 align:start position:0%
commission anyone
 
03:02:00.469 --> 03:02:00.479 align:start position:0%
else an agreeable Bunch
 
03:02:03.349 --> 03:02:03.359 align:start position:0%
today everyone's
 
03:02:09.150 --> 03:02:09.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:11.790 --> 03:02:11.800 align:start position:0%
Kate I don't know do we have any house
 
03:02:14.110 --> 03:02:14.120 align:start position:0%
members left nope I don't know if that
 
03:02:15.870 --> 03:02:15.880 align:start position:0%
was an issue in the house that was dis
 
03:02:19.349 --> 03:02:19.359 align:start position:0%
oh representative with with this Justice
 
03:02:21.349 --> 03:02:21.359 align:start position:0%
reinvestment fund I didn't
 
03:02:23.710 --> 03:02:23.720 align:start position:0%
know that that language actually never
 
03:02:25.070 --> 03:02:25.080 align:start position:0%
made it to the Senate so we didn't have
 
03:02:26.550 --> 03:02:26.560 align:start position:0%
a conversation I didn't know what the
 
03:02:28.269 --> 03:02:28.279 align:start position:0%
conversation was in the house if there
 
03:02:29.870 --> 03:02:29.880 align:start position:0%
even was
 
03:02:33.990 --> 03:02:34.000 align:start position:0%
one on this this Justice reinvestment
 
03:02:38.070 --> 03:02:38.080 align:start position:0%
fund okay okay Al will that when it
 
03:02:40.590 --> 03:02:40.600 align:start position:0%
comes to these specific
 
03:02:45.070 --> 03:02:45.080 align:start position:0%
funds representative all to have a
 
03:02:49.830 --> 03:02:49.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:51.870 --> 03:02:51.880 align:start position:0%
imagine that's
 
03:02:54.710 --> 03:02:54.720 align:start position:0%
right Senator Whitley yes um on that on
 
03:02:56.469 --> 03:02:56.479 align:start position:0%
that issue it never actually made it to
 
03:02:58.110 --> 03:02:58.120 align:start position:0%
the house for consideration in an
 
03:03:00.349 --> 03:03:00.359 align:start position:0%
earlier draft by the time it came out of
 
03:03:03.550 --> 03:03:03.560 align:start position:0%
os was I removed so yeah the house is
 
03:03:05.790 --> 03:03:05.800 align:start position:0%
not considered okay thank thank you for
 
03:03:07.630 --> 03:03:07.640 align:start position:0%
that background again I do think it's an
 
03:03:10.550 --> 03:03:10.560 align:start position:0%
important uh part of the puzzle here and
 
03:03:13.870 --> 03:03:13.880 align:start position:0%
we do have the time now to um make sure
 
03:03:15.630 --> 03:03:15.640 align:start position:0%
we have a balanced approach so I
 
03:03:19.429 --> 03:03:19.439 align:start position:0%
appreciate uh the consensus on that
 
03:03:26.030 --> 03:03:26.040 align:start position:0%
issue okay moving on um section
 
03:03:29.110 --> 03:03:29.120 align:start position:0%
five uh we have an appropriation
 
03:03:30.670 --> 03:03:30.680 align:start position:0%
particularly the department of safety I
 
03:03:31.750 --> 03:03:31.760 align:start position:0%
don't know if the department of safety
 
03:03:33.349 --> 03:03:33.359 align:start position:0%
wanted to comment on that we're on line
 
03:03:42.469 --> 03:03:42.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:42.479 --> 03:03:49.429 align:start position:0%
 
34

03:03:49.429 --> 03:03:49.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:52.510 --> 03:03:52.520 align:start position:0%
okay so with the would the department of
 
03:03:54.349 --> 03:03:54.359 align:start position:0%
safety just get back to us if they have
 
03:04:05.229 --> 03:04:05.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:07.830 --> 03:04:07.840 align:start position:0%
okay okay
 
03:04:12.229 --> 03:04:12.239 align:start position:0%
um moving on of the remaining funds 50%
 
03:04:14.150 --> 03:04:14.160 align:start position:0%
of the remaining funds shall be uh
 
03:04:19.389 --> 03:04:19.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:19.399 --> 03:04:22.190 align:start position:0%
 
fund

03:04:22.190 --> 03:04:22.200 align:start position:0%
fund
 
03:04:26.349 --> 03:04:26.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:29.309 --> 03:04:29.319 align:start position:0%
system and then uh maybe we'll have a
 
03:04:31.750 --> 03:04:31.760 align:start position:0%
convers a further conversation on three
 
03:04:34.910 --> 03:04:34.920 align:start position:0%
subsection three line 13 on
 
03:04:42.349 --> 03:04:42.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:42.359 --> 03:04:43.910 align:start position:0%
 
28

03:04:43.910 --> 03:04:43.920 align:start position:0%
28
 
03:04:45.309 --> 03:04:45.319 align:start position:0%
I didn't know if the public health folks
 
03:04:48.590 --> 03:04:48.600 align:start position:0%
had further suggestions
 
03:04:53.990 --> 03:04:54.000 align:start position:0%
or I have a um question I think of
 
03:04:58.429 --> 03:04:58.439 align:start position:0%
um Chief Miker on on the uh 10% of
 
03:05:00.190 --> 03:05:00.200 align:start position:0%
remaining fins or 25 million whichever
 
03:05:02.110 --> 03:05:02.120 align:start position:0%
is less shall be credited to the
 
03:05:04.269 --> 03:05:04.279 align:start position:0%
Substance Abuse Prevention and Recovery
 
03:05:08.950 --> 03:05:08.960 align:start position:0%
Fund how does that um 25 million uh
 
03:05:11.030 --> 03:05:11.040 align:start position:0%
compared to the allocation which is
 
03:05:12.950 --> 03:05:12.960 align:start position:0%
currently dedicated through the alcohol
 
03:05:16.030 --> 03:05:16.040 align:start position:0%
fund the the the
 
03:05:20.429 --> 03:05:20.439 align:start position:0%
profits it's 5% of the profit so the
 
03:05:25.630 --> 03:05:25.640 align:start position:0%
alcohol fund was 5% or around 11 million
 
03:05:29.070 --> 03:05:29.080 align:start position:0%
last year 11 million approxim
 
03:05:32.550 --> 03:05:32.560 align:start position:0%
approximately okay so it Madam chair is
 
03:05:34.429 --> 03:05:34.439 align:start position:0%
is there a provision here that that
 
03:05:36.950 --> 03:05:36.960 align:start position:0%
prevents the direction of these funds to
 
03:05:39.429 --> 03:05:39.439 align:start position:0%
the general fund as what happened with
 
03:05:42.269 --> 03:05:42.279 align:start position:0%
the uh tobacco
 
03:05:44.630 --> 03:05:44.640 align:start position:0%
settlement Kate you're welcome to come
 
03:05:46.670 --> 03:05:46.680 align:start position:0%
back that's an important point because
 
03:05:49.110 --> 03:05:49.120 align:start position:0%
you know it has historically been rated
 
03:05:51.030 --> 03:05:51.040 align:start position:0%
every single year um and I know that's
 
03:05:56.269 --> 03:05:56.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:58.830 --> 03:05:58.840 align:start position:0%
through so again for the record Kate fry
 
03:06:01.910 --> 03:06:01.920 align:start position:0%
from um new Futures yes so in um again
 
03:06:05.190 --> 03:06:05.200 align:start position:0%
in our memo I believe um on number two
 
03:06:08.110 --> 03:06:08.120 align:start position:0%
the creation of that fund the Substance
 
03:06:10.070 --> 03:06:10.080 align:start position:0%
Abuse Prevention and treatment fund we
 
03:06:13.429 --> 03:06:13.439 align:start position:0%
had discussed this quite a bit is that
 
03:06:16.030 --> 03:06:16.040 align:start position:0%
the idea behind that was to create a
 
03:06:18.910 --> 03:06:18.920 align:start position:0%
separate fund following the opiate
 
03:06:21.830 --> 03:06:21.840 align:start position:0%
baitman trust fund um that was
 
03:06:23.349 --> 03:06:23.359 align:start position:0%
completely separate from the general
 
03:06:26.070 --> 03:06:26.080 align:start position:0%
fund couldn't be touched um funds
 
03:06:27.870 --> 03:06:27.880 align:start position:0%
couldn't be swept because what had
 
03:06:29.510 --> 03:06:29.520 align:start position:0%
previously happened with the alcohol
 
03:06:31.830 --> 03:06:31.840 align:start position:0%
fund is that was more of a budget
 
03:06:35.030 --> 03:06:35.040 align:start position:0%
process though that um RSA was suspended
 
03:06:37.229 --> 03:06:37.239 align:start position:0%
every two years in the in the early year
 
03:06:38.389 --> 03:06:38.399 align:start position:0%
so that's why you weren't seeing the
 
03:06:41.229 --> 03:06:41.239 align:start position:0%
full 5% this makes this is a completely
 
03:06:43.510 --> 03:06:43.520 align:start position:0%
separate fund you can't trust or that
 
03:06:46.590 --> 03:06:46.600 align:start position:0%
you can trust that does not get diverted
 
03:06:48.510 --> 03:06:48.520 align:start position:0%
um and again learning from the opiate
 
03:06:49.990 --> 03:06:50.000 align:start position:0%
abatement the creation of the opiate
 
03:06:52.190 --> 03:06:52.200 align:start position:0%
abatement trust fund where these um
 
03:06:53.910 --> 03:06:53.920 align:start position:0%
settlement funds are coming in we want
 
03:06:55.429 --> 03:06:55.439 align:start position:0%
to make sure we wanted to make sure
 
03:06:57.150 --> 03:06:57.160 align:start position:0%
those weren't going elsewhere so we just
 
03:06:58.710 --> 03:06:58.720 align:start position:0%
copied that language to do the same
 
03:07:02.110 --> 03:07:02.120 align:start position:0%
thing here okay thank you yeah and and
 
03:07:05.790 --> 03:07:05.800 align:start position:0%
um as new Futures noted in their memo
 
03:07:07.950 --> 03:07:07.960 align:start position:0%
the commission was had reached consensus
 
03:07:09.790 --> 03:07:09.800 align:start position:0%
on inclusion of that and made a lot of
 
03:07:11.469 --> 03:07:11.479 align:start position:0%
sense thank you for raing that yes the
 
03:07:13.190 --> 03:07:13.200 align:start position:0%
commission has oversight on that yes
 
03:07:14.830 --> 03:07:14.840 align:start position:0%
thank you for that point Senator Lang oh
 
03:07:16.630 --> 03:07:16.640 align:start position:0%
don't go away yet Senator Lang had made
 
03:07:19.550 --> 03:07:19.560 align:start position:0%
the recommendation in subsection three
 
03:07:21.830 --> 03:07:21.840 align:start position:0%
or an issue of discussion about
 
03:07:26.550 --> 03:07:26.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:29.389 --> 03:07:29.399 align:start position:0%
conversation regarding funding the
 
03:07:35.870 --> 03:07:35.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:38.030 --> 03:07:38.040 align:start position:0%
three or if you have any comments about
 
03:07:40.630 --> 03:07:40.640 align:start position:0%
that under the Cannabis fund establish
 
03:07:43.990 --> 03:07:44.000 align:start position:0%
Roman numeral 3 or um subsection 3 on
 
03:07:50.389 --> 03:07:50.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:55.030 --> 03:07:55.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:57.830 --> 03:07:57.840 align:start position:0%
um so I think there's a couple thoughts
 
03:08:00.990 --> 03:08:01.000 align:start position:0%
here uh so we've heard very clearly over
 
03:08:02.670 --> 03:08:02.680 align:start position:0%
and over again that there's a
 
03:08:05.630 --> 03:08:05.640 align:start position:0%
significant um connection that has been
 
03:08:08.870 --> 03:08:08.880 align:start position:0%
established by science with um
 
03:08:11.510 --> 03:08:11.520 align:start position:0%
specifically High potency products and
 
03:08:14.110 --> 03:08:14.120 align:start position:0%
uh mental health issues certainly with
 
03:08:19.030 --> 03:08:19.040 align:start position:0%
psychosis um so I think with whatever
 
03:08:21.150 --> 03:08:21.160 align:start position:0%
number you end up what there you could
 
03:08:23.229 --> 03:08:23.239 align:start position:0%
go around this a couple ways you could
 
03:08:25.510 --> 03:08:25.520 align:start position:0%
have the governor's uh the Substance
 
03:08:27.030 --> 03:08:27.040 align:start position:0%
Abuse Prevention and treatment fund
 
03:08:28.950 --> 03:08:28.960 align:start position:0%
which is overseen by the governor's
 
03:08:28.960 --> 03:08:30.790 align:start position:0%
which is overseen by the governor's
commission

03:08:30.790 --> 03:08:30.800 align:start position:0%
commission
 
03:08:34.630 --> 03:08:34.640 align:start position:0%
um that aside a certain amount to go
 
03:08:38.110 --> 03:08:38.120 align:start position:0%
towards that specific issues I think um
 
03:08:40.790 --> 03:08:40.800 align:start position:0%
the concern is that the governor's
 
03:08:42.510 --> 03:08:42.520 align:start position:0%
Commission on Alcohol and Other Drugs
 
03:08:44.630 --> 03:08:44.640 align:start position:0%
just does funding for substance use
 
03:08:46.990 --> 03:08:47.000 align:start position:0%
disorder which is not necessarily the
 
03:08:49.790 --> 03:08:49.800 align:start position:0%
case they do prevention treatment and
 
03:08:52.389 --> 03:08:52.399 align:start position:0%
Recovery uh funding for behavioral
 
03:08:54.950 --> 03:08:54.960 align:start position:0%
health issues so they have done
 
03:08:56.830 --> 03:08:56.840 align:start position:0%
significant amount of funding for the
 
03:08:58.990 --> 03:08:59.000 align:start position:0%
behavioral health issues co-occurring
 
03:09:02.590 --> 03:09:02.600 align:start position:0%
issues um but if the concern is about
 
03:09:06.830 --> 03:09:06.840 align:start position:0%
significantly earmarking um an amount to
 
03:09:11.349 --> 03:09:11.359 align:start position:0%
go towards um a an issue that Nami is uh
 
03:09:13.030 --> 03:09:13.040 align:start position:0%
concerned about significantly I think
 
03:09:14.550 --> 03:09:14.560 align:start position:0%
they're concerned about firsttime
 
03:09:17.469 --> 03:09:17.479 align:start position:0%
psychosis and having cbha support
 
03:09:20.429 --> 03:09:20.439 align:start position:0%
supports at the cbha you could set aside
 
03:09:24.229 --> 03:09:24.239 align:start position:0%
a certain amount of that from the um
 
03:09:26.030 --> 03:09:26.040 align:start position:0%
from that amount that goes to the
 
03:09:27.790 --> 03:09:27.800 align:start position:0%
governor's commission but there's also
 
03:09:30.710 --> 03:09:30.720 align:start position:0%
something here in Roman numeral 5 right
 
03:09:34.830 --> 03:09:34.840 align:start position:0%
that you could clarify that um goes to
 
03:09:37.469 --> 03:09:37.479 align:start position:0%
um clarify that might um address those
 
03:09:39.510 --> 03:09:39.520 align:start position:0%
issues more so I do think there are
 
03:09:43.349 --> 03:09:43.359 align:start position:0%
places within here that we could um come
 
03:09:45.710 --> 03:09:45.720 align:start position:0%
up with some language that addresses
 
03:09:47.269 --> 03:09:47.279 align:start position:0%
those concerns
 
03:09:52.110 --> 03:09:52.120 align:start position:0%
specifically um and either have it um a
 
03:09:53.590 --> 03:09:53.600 align:start position:0%
part of the funding that goes to the
 
03:09:57.469 --> 03:09:57.479 align:start position:0%
governor's commission or tweak five or
 
03:09:59.710 --> 03:09:59.720 align:start position:0%
um you know if they wanted to set aside
 
03:10:01.389 --> 03:10:01.399 align:start position:0%
a different amount we're certainly
 
03:10:04.110 --> 03:10:04.120 align:start position:0%
amendable to
 
03:10:07.590 --> 03:10:07.600 align:start position:0%
that goad I'm I think there's a risk in
 
03:10:11.590 --> 03:10:11.600 align:start position:0%
setting aside um dollars for advocacy
 
03:10:14.990 --> 03:10:15.000 align:start position:0%
organizations when funds are are in
 
03:10:18.309 --> 03:10:18.319 align:start position:0%
scarce uh demand in the state if that if
 
03:10:20.590 --> 03:10:20.600 align:start position:0%
if I'm understanding what I'm hearing
 
03:10:23.750 --> 03:10:23.760 align:start position:0%
right here uh well I I think especially
 
03:10:26.349 --> 03:10:26.359 align:start position:0%
if it child well you're right so with I
 
03:10:30.710 --> 03:10:30.720 align:start position:0%
think the uh thought about Nami is their
 
03:10:34.190 --> 03:10:34.200 align:start position:0%
their more provider side of their shop
 
03:10:36.590 --> 03:10:36.600 align:start position:0%
that works on the first EP psychosis
 
03:10:38.590 --> 03:10:38.600 align:start position:0%
issue so actually Kate what I'm going to
 
03:10:40.910 --> 03:10:40.920 align:start position:0%
ask of you is to
 
03:10:43.349 --> 03:10:43.359 align:start position:0%
um go ahead so I actually have another
 
03:10:45.429 --> 03:10:45.439 align:start position:0%
suggestion I just had to find it so on
 
03:10:49.150 --> 03:10:49.160 align:start position:0%
page two of the bill under the Substance
 
03:10:51.910 --> 03:10:51.920 align:start position:0%
Abuse Prevention and Recovery
 
03:10:56.950 --> 03:10:56.960 align:start position:0%
funds under Roman numeral 5 y this is it
 
03:10:58.870 --> 03:10:58.880 align:start position:0%
gets much more specific of how these
 
03:11:01.790 --> 03:11:01.800 align:start position:0%
funds are to be spent and you will see
 
03:11:03.870 --> 03:11:03.880 align:start position:0%
already that there is some language for
 
03:11:05.790 --> 03:11:05.800 align:start position:0%
mental health TR uh treatment with a
 
03:11:07.910 --> 03:11:07.920 align:start position:0%
focus on Dual diagnosis of both mental
 
03:11:10.830 --> 03:11:10.840 align:start position:0%
health and substance misuse disorders um
 
03:11:12.870 --> 03:11:12.880 align:start position:0%
I don't know if that's to the extent
 
03:11:14.269 --> 03:11:14.279 align:start position:0%
that they're looking into but we could
 
03:11:17.950 --> 03:11:17.960 align:start position:0%
tweak that language there
 
03:11:20.429 --> 03:11:20.439 align:start position:0%
um so you know there's there's some
 
03:11:22.190 --> 03:11:22.200 align:start position:0%
wiggle room here that we could put some
 
03:11:24.309 --> 03:11:24.319 align:start position:0%
language in I I would want to just look
 
03:11:27.630 --> 03:11:27.640 align:start position:0%
at what they're interested in funding
 
03:11:29.750 --> 03:11:29.760 align:start position:0%
again the Lang the the funding wouldn't
 
03:11:31.110 --> 03:11:31.120 align:start position:0%
go directly I don't think to Nami I
 
03:11:32.790 --> 03:11:32.800 align:start position:0%
think the intent is to have an
 
03:11:35.790 --> 03:11:35.800 align:start position:0%
infrastructure that can deal with these
 
03:11:38.590 --> 03:11:38.600 align:start position:0%
um in uh increasing cases of psychosis
 
03:11:39.910 --> 03:11:39.920 align:start position:0%
and mental health is correct and I think
 
03:11:40.790 --> 03:11:40.800 align:start position:0%
that you're right that we're not going
 
03:11:42.790 --> 03:11:42.800 align:start position:0%
to name the organization in the statute
 
03:11:44.830 --> 03:11:44.840 align:start position:0%
yeah so if if there's some language I'm
 
03:11:47.670 --> 03:11:47.680 align:start position:0%
happy to to try to uh work that in
 
03:11:49.309 --> 03:11:49.319 align:start position:0%
somewhere I just haven't seen anything
 
03:11:51.150 --> 03:11:51.160 align:start position:0%
directly from Namy all right if you
 
03:11:53.150 --> 03:11:53.160 align:start position:0%
wanted to touch base with them and make
 
03:11:55.030 --> 03:11:55.040 align:start position:0%
sure that that issue is covered then you
 
03:11:56.429 --> 03:11:56.439 align:start position:0%
can come back to us on that okay thank
 
03:11:58.590 --> 03:11:58.600 align:start position:0%
you thank
 
03:12:00.590 --> 03:12:00.600 align:start position:0%
you Senator if we're done with that
 
03:12:03.110 --> 03:12:03.120 align:start position:0%
section before Kate gets up oh sorry
 
03:12:05.429 --> 03:12:05.439 align:start position:0%
Kate um it's your
 
03:12:08.510 --> 03:12:08.520 align:start position:0%
day I I believe I may be incorrect but I
 
03:12:10.030 --> 03:12:10.040 align:start position:0%
think last time we didn't get to this
 
03:12:13.870 --> 03:12:13.880 align:start position:0%
issue it's on page three um number eight
 
03:12:16.750 --> 03:12:16.760 align:start position:0%
in new Futures memo oh page three of the
 
03:12:18.790 --> 03:12:18.800 align:start position:0%
memo say that again page three number
 
03:12:20.910 --> 03:12:20.920 align:start position:0%
eight uh which is the public health
 
03:12:22.550 --> 03:12:22.560 align:start position:0%
advisory committee that's doing with the
 
03:12:24.269 --> 03:12:24.279 align:start position:0%
public health side but not the business
 
03:12:26.550 --> 03:12:26.560 align:start position:0%
side I think that we did I my memory
 
03:12:28.349 --> 03:12:28.359 align:start position:0%
because I have a check next to it okay
 
03:12:30.469 --> 03:12:30.479 align:start position:0%
is that we reached consensus I just
 
03:12:31.429 --> 03:12:31.439 align:start position:0%
don't know if we figured out where
 
03:12:33.950 --> 03:12:33.960 align:start position:0%
exactly that was going yes I I was
 
03:12:36.229 --> 03:12:36.239 align:start position:0%
remiss I I was gonna um make some
 
03:12:38.990 --> 03:12:39.000 align:start position:0%
suggestions I'm happy to work with um
 
03:12:42.990 --> 03:12:43.000 align:start position:0%
the commissioner and um Le uh Mr VAR to
 
03:12:44.830 --> 03:12:44.840 align:start position:0%
to provide some suggestions of where
 
03:12:46.750 --> 03:12:46.760 align:start position:0%
that public health advisory commission
 
03:12:49.590 --> 03:12:49.600 align:start position:0%
might fit in I was thinking around the
 
03:12:51.790 --> 03:12:51.800 align:start position:0%
section around R making but we can
 
03:12:54.349 --> 03:12:54.359 align:start position:0%
certainly talk about that and I've since
 
03:12:56.429 --> 03:12:56.439 align:start position:0%
had some thoughts and some suggestions
 
03:12:58.510 --> 03:12:58.520 align:start position:0%
since we discussed the commissioner and
 
03:13:00.349 --> 03:13:00.359 align:start position:0%
I I want to be clear that it's not to
 
03:13:02.670 --> 03:13:02.680 align:start position:0%
approve every single product it's more
 
03:13:06.389 --> 03:13:06.399 align:start position:0%
to establish guidelines on public health
 
03:13:08.229 --> 03:13:08.239 align:start position:0%
um related issues we need to be
 
03:13:10.030 --> 03:13:10.040 align:start position:0%
concerned about with some products right
 
03:13:11.590 --> 03:13:11.600 align:start position:0%
so we have a consensus that it should be
 
03:13:13.309 --> 03:13:13.319 align:start position:0%
included I think the question is where
 
03:13:16.830 --> 03:13:16.840 align:start position:0%
it should go you agree okay anything
 
03:13:18.750 --> 03:13:18.760 align:start position:0%
else from Kate before she gets
 
03:13:21.550 --> 03:13:21.560 align:start position:0%
up thank you we were losing people
 
03:13:23.990 --> 03:13:24.000 align:start position:0%
rapidly yeah I don't you know I think
 
03:13:26.190 --> 03:13:26.200 align:start position:0%
Senator well Senator abbis is going to
 
03:13:29.389 --> 03:13:29.399 align:start position:0%
be here can I just take a pause and ask
 
03:13:30.790 --> 03:13:30.800 align:start position:0%
what people's schedules are for the
 
03:13:32.469 --> 03:13:32.479 align:start position:0%
remainder of the day it doesn't make
 
03:13:34.190 --> 03:13:34.200 align:start position:0%
sense to me to keep doing this if we
 
03:13:36.790 --> 03:13:36.800 align:start position:0%
don't have a critical mass
 
03:13:39.110 --> 03:13:39.120 align:start position:0%
here you're here for the
 
03:13:42.150 --> 03:13:42.160 align:start position:0%
duration yeah I I think they mentioned 3
 
03:13:44.510 --> 03:13:44.520 align:start position:0%
p.m. right
 
03:13:47.150 --> 03:13:47.160 align:start position:0%
and yeah no right I just I wanted
 
03:13:48.670 --> 03:13:48.680 align:start position:0%
because some people have to leave it
 
03:13:52.870 --> 03:13:52.880 align:start position:0%
looks like it is you made great progress
 
03:13:55.389 --> 03:13:55.399 align:start position:0%
so yeah well I I think at some point
 
03:13:56.870 --> 03:13:56.880 align:start position:0%
we're gonna pause for lunch and then
 
03:13:59.070 --> 03:13:59.080 align:start position:0%
come back at 1 are people or is that
 
03:14:02.150 --> 03:14:02.160 align:start position:0%
good for everyone okay just ask a
 
03:14:06.229 --> 03:14:06.239 align:start position:0%
question is this the intent to uh
 
03:14:09.030 --> 03:14:09.040 align:start position:0%
complete the line in line out today or
 
03:14:11.830 --> 03:14:11.840 align:start position:0%
is that is that going to continue on on
 
03:14:14.510 --> 03:14:14.520 align:start position:0%
depends we get okay yeah all right so
 
03:14:16.910 --> 03:14:16.920 align:start position:0%
it's 12:15 I think this is a good
 
03:14:19.110 --> 03:14:19.120 align:start position:0%
stopping point why don't we come back at
 
03:14:21.910 --> 03:14:21.920 align:start position:0%
1:00 and um hopefully Senator AAL will
 
03:14:24.349 --> 03:14:24.359 align:start position:0%
join us but I think we we're making good
 
03:14:41.469 --> 03:14:41.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:41.479 --> 04:09:29.710 align:start position:0%
 
you

04:09:29.710 --> 04:09:29.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:31.870 --> 04:09:31.880 align:start position:0%
glad thank you and
 
04:09:35.030 --> 04:09:35.040 align:start position:0%
I'll reconvene from the recess sorry
 
04:09:36.510 --> 04:09:36.520 align:start position:0%
that I was
 
04:09:36.520 --> 04:09:41.950 align:start position:0%
that I was
late

04:09:41.950 --> 04:09:41.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:43.550 --> 04:09:43.560 align:start position:0%
by that time I was three hours and 15
 
04:09:46.070 --> 04:09:46.080 align:start position:0%
minutes late thank you Senate again
 
04:09:46.080 --> 04:09:48.030 align:start position:0%
minutes late thank you Senate again
you're

04:09:48.030 --> 04:09:48.040 align:start position:0%
you're
 
04:09:50.990 --> 04:09:51.000 align:start position:0%
welcome we're on page 29 if I understand
 
04:09:53.149 --> 04:09:53.159 align:start position:0%
that correctly yeah we made good
 
04:09:55.630 --> 04:09:55.640 align:start position:0%
progress Senator with um going through
 
04:09:57.670 --> 04:09:57.680 align:start position:0%
the various funds I think we have some
 
04:10:01.349 --> 04:10:01.359 align:start position:0%
open questions just for your information
 
04:10:04.349 --> 04:10:04.359 align:start position:0%
if you if you go back to page 24
 
04:10:06.950 --> 04:10:06.960 align:start position:0%
starting on line 26 these are all the
 
04:10:09.670 --> 04:10:09.680 align:start position:0%
nisp discrimination Provisions I think
 
04:10:12.269 --> 04:10:12.279 align:start position:0%
we the commission rightly identified
 
04:10:14.109 --> 04:10:14.119 align:start position:0%
that this needs a whole lot of work
 
04:10:16.590 --> 04:10:16.600 align:start position:0%
because there's a whole body of existing
 
04:10:19.149 --> 04:10:19.159 align:start position:0%
Law related to licenses relating to
 
04:10:21.510 --> 04:10:21.520 align:start position:0%
employment and so the Attorney General's
 
04:10:25.030 --> 04:10:25.040 align:start position:0%
office has graciously offered to um work
 
04:10:26.750 --> 04:10:26.760 align:start position:0%
on this with us to make sure that we're
 
04:10:29.550 --> 04:10:29.560 align:start position:0%
not interfering with other uh bodies of
 
04:10:34.149 --> 04:10:34.159 align:start position:0%
law so um and that brings us to right up
 
04:10:36.429 --> 04:10:36.439 align:start position:0%
to page 29 to the statutory
 
04:10:36.439 --> 04:10:46.990 align:start position:0%
to page 29 to the statutory
changes

04:10:46.990 --> 04:10:47.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:49.630 --> 04:10:49.640 align:start position:0%
are we on number eight yeah we hadn't we
 
04:10:55.109 --> 04:10:55.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:57.229 --> 04:10:57.239 align:start position:0%
yeah so and this has to do with
 
04:10:59.030 --> 04:10:59.040 align:start position:0%
penalties I I guess this would apply to
 
04:11:01.109 --> 04:11:01.119 align:start position:0%
the black market when I what I read the
 
04:11:02.910 --> 04:11:02.920 align:start position:0%
section mean we have any anyone have any
 
04:11:05.389 --> 04:11:05.399 align:start position:0%
comments on you know parag uh paragraphs
 
04:11:11.870 --> 04:11:11.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:13.550 --> 04:11:13.560 align:start position:0%
maybe we should double whatever the
 
04:11:15.389 --> 04:11:15.399 align:start position:0%
penalties are for the black market just
 
04:11:15.399 --> 04:11:19.870 align:start position:0%
penalties are for the black market just
double

04:11:19.870 --> 04:11:19.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:21.870 --> 04:11:21.880 align:start position:0%
them so
 
04:11:23.830 --> 04:11:23.840 align:start position:0%
that I understand what you're saying and
 
04:11:25.229 --> 04:11:25.239 align:start position:0%
I understand the logic behind that the
 
04:11:27.229 --> 04:11:27.239 align:start position:0%
problem is is it's it's it's a certain
 
04:11:29.630 --> 04:11:29.640 align:start position:0%
class of each drug is put into classes
 
04:11:30.790 --> 04:11:30.800 align:start position:0%
usually not a
 
04:11:33.389 --> 04:11:33.399 align:start position:0%
standalone um we probably want to make
 
04:11:35.189 --> 04:11:35.199 align:start position:0%
it consistent with the bootlegging laws
 
04:11:37.670 --> 04:11:37.680 align:start position:0%
but if we do did something like that but
 
04:11:41.109 --> 04:11:41.119 align:start position:0%
I know that's not really rampid
 
04:11:43.550 --> 04:11:43.560 align:start position:0%
um I know there'll be a black market
 
04:11:46.550 --> 04:11:46.560 align:start position:0%
impact one way or another many say it
 
04:11:48.189 --> 04:11:48.199 align:start position:0%
the black market will increase if we do
 
04:11:49.910 --> 04:11:49.920 align:start position:0%
this but I
 
04:11:54.630 --> 04:11:54.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:56.870 --> 04:11:56.880 align:start position:0%
penalties is the I guess is the current
 
04:11:59.510 --> 04:11:59.520 align:start position:0%
penalty in insufficient does anyone find
 
04:11:59.520 --> 04:12:00.229 align:start position:0%
penalty in insufficient does anyone find
to

04:12:00.229 --> 04:12:00.239 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:12:04.149 --> 04:12:04.159 align:start position:0%
me well is the current penalty stopping
 
04:12:06.349 --> 04:12:06.359 align:start position:0%
the black market I would say no then
 
04:12:09.590 --> 04:12:09.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:11.830 --> 04:12:11.840 align:start position:0%
well unlike unlike our model I I mean
 
04:12:13.229 --> 04:12:13.239 align:start position:0%
unlike the other states who did nothing
 
04:12:15.750 --> 04:12:15.760 align:start position:0%
to deal with the black market they just
 
04:12:17.070 --> 04:12:17.080 align:start position:0%
they say there's a black market problem
 
04:12:18.229 --> 04:12:18.239 align:start position:0%
they just sit there and do nothing about
 
04:12:20.630 --> 04:12:20.640 align:start position:0%
it they just make an observation and
 
04:12:22.429 --> 04:12:22.439 align:start position:0%
carry around with the day I think what
 
04:12:25.550 --> 04:12:25.560 align:start position:0%
we have here is a model that's designed
 
04:12:27.389 --> 04:12:27.399 align:start position:0%
to actually be remain competitive with
 
04:12:29.429 --> 04:12:29.439 align:start position:0%
the black market so the price point will
 
04:12:32.269 --> 04:12:32.279 align:start position:0%
actually be closer in the number as
 
04:12:34.910 --> 04:12:34.920 align:start position:0%
opposed to it which disincentivizes
 
04:12:36.429 --> 04:12:36.439 align:start position:0%
someone from buying something on the
 
04:12:39.990 --> 04:12:40.000 align:start position:0%
street which you don't want um it's the
 
04:12:43.149 --> 04:12:43.159 align:start position:0%
idea is for them to come to a store here
 
04:12:45.189 --> 04:12:45.199 align:start position:0%
one of the retail stores so we're hoping
 
04:12:47.510 --> 04:12:47.520 align:start position:0%
that that would actually be we have a
 
04:12:48.990 --> 04:12:49.000 align:start position:0%
competitive price point rather than like
 
04:12:50.349 --> 04:12:50.359 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts it's almost double the
 
04:12:52.750 --> 04:12:52.760 align:start position:0%
price when you count the sales tax so
 
04:12:54.429 --> 04:12:54.439 align:start position:0%
people have lower incomes are still
 
04:12:56.510 --> 04:12:56.520 align:start position:0%
going to resort to the black market
 
04:12:58.790 --> 04:12:58.800 align:start position:0%
we're trying to move away from that not
 
04:13:00.910 --> 04:13:00.920 align:start position:0%
oversaturate the legal market and that's
 
04:13:02.309 --> 04:13:02.319 align:start position:0%
why having a hand on the wheel is a good
 
04:13:05.550 --> 04:13:05.560 align:start position:0%
idea so I understand the other states
 
04:13:06.950 --> 04:13:06.960 align:start position:0%
had that problem we're trying to avoid
 
04:13:06.960 --> 04:13:08.229 align:start position:0%
had that problem we're trying to avoid
that

04:13:08.229 --> 04:13:08.239 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:13:09.630 --> 04:13:09.640 align:start position:0%
problem they're like a moop flying into
 
04:13:11.309 --> 04:13:11.319 align:start position:0%
a light the way the states we're not
 
04:13:13.830 --> 04:13:13.840 align:start position:0%
doing that so maybe I would say we let's
 
04:13:15.910 --> 04:13:15.920 align:start position:0%
see how it plays out in the real world
 
04:13:17.469 --> 04:13:17.479 align:start position:0%
and I'm with you if it gets if it gets
 
04:13:18.750 --> 04:13:18.760 align:start position:0%
start to get out of hand I would be I
 
04:13:21.790 --> 04:13:21.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:24.590 --> 04:13:24.600 align:start position:0%
now um right yeah no I agree with you
 
04:13:26.309 --> 04:13:26.319 align:start position:0%
Senator and I think just clarifying as
 
04:13:27.750 --> 04:13:27.760 align:start position:0%
well that we're we're not talking about
 
04:13:29.109 --> 04:13:29.119 align:start position:0%
changing anything we're just really
 
04:13:31.510 --> 04:13:31.520 align:start position:0%
pulling people who are 21 and over out
 
04:13:33.550 --> 04:13:33.560 align:start position:0%
of the current marijuana penalty regime
 
04:13:35.189 --> 04:13:35.199 align:start position:0%
because we're legalizing into substance
 
04:13:36.590 --> 04:13:36.600 align:start position:0%
and so this is really just how does it
 
04:13:38.389 --> 04:13:38.399 align:start position:0%
impact people 20 under
 
04:13:40.630 --> 04:13:40.640 align:start position:0%
21 right so I think that's important
 
04:13:43.149 --> 04:13:43.159 align:start position:0%
context for what these statutory changes
 
04:13:44.910 --> 04:13:44.920 align:start position:0%
are we're not changing any law we're
 
04:13:47.950 --> 04:13:47.960 align:start position:0%
just m uh we're not changing any policy
 
04:13:50.830 --> 04:13:50.840 align:start position:0%
really uh we are just updating current
 
04:13:52.349 --> 04:13:52.359 align:start position:0%
law to reflect what we're doing
 
04:13:53.750 --> 04:13:53.760 align:start position:0%
policy-wise in the remainder of the
 
04:13:56.189 --> 04:13:56.199 align:start position:0%
statute the remainder of the bill and
 
04:13:58.550 --> 04:13:58.560 align:start position:0%
and not to get too far into this on
 
04:14:00.710 --> 04:14:00.720 align:start position:0%
right now but if we whatever we decide
 
04:14:02.550 --> 04:14:02.560 align:start position:0%
on a possession limit of what you can
 
04:14:04.670 --> 04:14:04.680 align:start position:0%
purchase I thought that the the law
 
04:14:05.710 --> 04:14:05.720 align:start position:0%
should remain
 
04:14:08.030 --> 04:14:08.040 align:start position:0%
consistent with this and this is three
 
04:14:11.389 --> 04:14:11.399 align:start position:0%
this is 34 of an ounce or more I don't
 
04:14:12.750 --> 04:14:12.760 align:start position:0%
think we need to address it right now
 
04:14:15.229 --> 04:14:15.239 align:start position:0%
but in future legislation we may want to
 
04:14:17.189 --> 04:14:17.199 align:start position:0%
line everything up y we'd very much
 
04:14:18.229 --> 04:14:18.239 align:start position:0%
agree with
 
04:14:22.510 --> 04:14:22.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:35.630 --> 04:14:35.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:40.149 --> 04:14:40.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:42.550 --> 04:14:42.560 align:start position:0%
12 it says marijuana does that need I
 
04:14:45.389 --> 04:14:45.399 align:start position:0%
know we want to use is marijan and
 
04:14:47.389 --> 04:14:47.399 align:start position:0%
cannabis is used interchangeably the law
 
04:14:49.269 --> 04:14:49.279 align:start position:0%
at this point I know cannabis is the
 
04:14:51.750 --> 04:14:51.760 align:start position:0%
term people want but that's the correct
 
04:14:54.790 --> 04:14:54.800 align:start position:0%
term well what in in existing law 318 it
 
04:15:05.990 --> 04:15:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:06.000 --> 04:15:22.349 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

04:15:22.349 --> 04:15:22.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:24.030 --> 04:15:24.040 align:start position:0%
someone can help me I'm drawing a blank
 
04:15:25.229 --> 04:15:25.239 align:start position:0%
what was the rational for striking
 
04:15:28.070 --> 04:15:28.080 align:start position:0%
paragraph B from the
 
04:15:35.990 --> 04:15:36.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:36.000 --> 04:15:37.510 align:start position:0%
 
13

04:15:37.510 --> 04:15:37.520 align:start position:0%
13
 
04:15:40.630 --> 04:15:40.640 align:start position:0%
it does it seem like they were uh
 
04:15:42.109 --> 04:15:42.119 align:start position:0%
assuming it's going to be legal so
 
04:15:44.830 --> 04:15:44.840 align:start position:0%
they're just striking that right because
 
04:15:47.109 --> 04:15:47.119 align:start position:0%
those things are now going to be legal
 
04:15:49.269 --> 04:15:49.279 align:start position:0%
over 20
 
04:15:49.279 --> 04:15:59.710 align:start position:0%
over 20
minut

04:15:59.710 --> 04:15:59.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:03.389 --> 04:16:03.399 align:start position:0%
okay the the attorney can the offer any
 
04:16:05.590 --> 04:16:05.600 align:start position:0%
insight on that in the AG's
 
04:16:09.269 --> 04:16:09.279 align:start position:0%
office are you speaking to line 15b 15
 
04:16:09.279 --> 04:16:15.429 align:start position:0%
office are you speaking to line 15b 15
to

04:16:15.429 --> 04:16:15.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:17.990 --> 04:16:18.000 align:start position:0%
20 this has to do with I my
 
04:16:19.469 --> 04:16:19.479 align:start position:0%
understanding if they qualified for
 
04:16:21.189 --> 04:16:21.199 align:start position:0%
through with if they had a therapeutic C
 
04:16:23.309 --> 04:16:23.319 align:start position:0%
but were under 21 they wouldn't be
 
04:16:25.550 --> 04:16:25.560 align:start position:0%
prosecuted I guess what would happen if
 
04:16:25.560 --> 04:16:26.670 align:start position:0%
prosecuted I guess what would happen if
you're

04:16:26.670 --> 04:16:26.680 align:start position:0%
you're
 
04:16:29.229 --> 04:16:29.239 align:start position:0%
20 because this has to do with personal
 
04:16:33.429 --> 04:16:33.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:35.389 --> 04:16:35.399 align:start position:0%
we you don't want to then stop
 
04:16:36.590 --> 04:16:36.600 align:start position:0%
Prosecuting people for having the
 
04:16:37.910 --> 04:16:37.920 align:start position:0%
therapy utic
 
04:16:40.670 --> 04:16:40.680 align:start position:0%
card or a 20-year-old with therapeutic
 
04:16:46.830 --> 04:16:46.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:49.590 --> 04:16:49.600 align:start position:0%
Mike not sure if it would cover that I'm
 
04:16:49.600 --> 04:16:51.550 align:start position:0%
Mike not sure if it would cover that I'm
just

04:16:51.550 --> 04:16:51.560 align:start position:0%
just
 
04:16:53.790 --> 04:16:53.800 align:start position:0%
um trying to interpret that don't have
 
04:16:55.149 --> 04:16:55.159 align:start position:0%
don't have a good answer for you at the
 
04:16:57.389 --> 04:16:57.399 align:start position:0%
moment we'll come back to that but just
 
04:17:01.389 --> 04:17:01.399 align:start position:0%
maybe for everyone's um brain we don't
 
04:17:03.630 --> 04:17:03.640 align:start position:0%
want to inadvertently allow criminalize
 
04:17:05.910 --> 04:17:05.920 align:start position:0%
the therapeutic 20-year-old with a
 
04:17:08.550 --> 04:17:08.560 align:start position:0%
therapeutic card number one but we also
 
04:17:10.149 --> 04:17:10.159 align:start position:0%
don't want to have no penalty in the law
 
04:17:11.790 --> 04:17:11.800 align:start position:0%
at all for someone who's 20 just using
 
04:17:17.229 --> 04:17:17.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:20.429 --> 04:17:20.439 align:start position:0%
right I have a question I'm trying to
 
04:17:23.229 --> 04:17:23.239 align:start position:0%
interpret the um it it looks like
 
04:17:24.870 --> 04:17:24.880 align:start position:0%
marijuana includes the leaves stems
 
04:17:26.630 --> 04:17:26.640 align:start position:0%
flowers and seeds of all species of the
 
04:17:29.750 --> 04:17:29.760 align:start position:0%
plant genus um cannabis but shall not
 
04:17:31.550 --> 04:17:31.560 align:start position:0%
include the resin extracted from any
 
04:17:34.550 --> 04:17:34.560 align:start position:0%
part of such plant why is that I mean we
 
04:17:36.990 --> 04:17:37.000 align:start position:0%
concentrates are such a problem today oh
 
04:17:38.229 --> 04:17:38.239 align:start position:0%
that's current law I'm sorry where you
 
04:17:39.870 --> 04:17:39.880 align:start position:0%
reading from so I think you're looking
 
04:17:44.710 --> 04:17:44.720 align:start position:0%
at page 30 line8 that's current
 
04:17:47.950 --> 04:17:47.960 align:start position:0%
law but current law seems like it needs
 
04:17:50.670 --> 04:17:50.680 align:start position:0%
needs to be um amended
 
04:17:53.990 --> 04:17:54.000 align:start position:0%
because that that's the resin and the
 
04:17:57.469 --> 04:17:57.479 align:start position:0%
concentrates are a major problem today
 
04:18:00.149 --> 04:18:00.159 align:start position:0%
shouldn't we strike seeds as well I mean
 
04:18:02.750 --> 04:18:02.760 align:start position:0%
is that it just doesn't seem
 
04:18:05.710 --> 04:18:05.720 align:start position:0%
right anyone I'm reading this
 
04:18:05.720 --> 04:18:10.389 align:start position:0%
right anyone I'm reading this
correctly

04:18:10.389 --> 04:18:10.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:14.309 --> 04:18:14.319 align:start position:0%
so we Define on page three cannabis and
 
04:18:16.910 --> 04:18:16.920 align:start position:0%
so I don't know if we just want to
 
04:18:18.750 --> 04:18:18.760 align:start position:0%
reference because this is the problem
 
04:18:20.070 --> 04:18:20.080 align:start position:0%
like it's already in the code it's a
 
04:18:21.670 --> 04:18:21.680 align:start position:0%
problem or sometimes we say cannabis
 
04:18:24.030 --> 04:18:24.040 align:start position:0%
sometimes we say marijuana so if we just
 
04:18:27.469 --> 04:18:27.479 align:start position:0%
want to we have the definition
 
04:18:32.229 --> 04:18:32.239 align:start position:0%
and all parts of the plant okay we gr it
 
04:18:35.870 --> 04:18:35.880 align:start position:0%
on okay so it seems like it's contrary
 
04:18:39.070 --> 04:18:39.080 align:start position:0%
to the definition on page three it's
 
04:18:42.109 --> 04:18:42.119 align:start position:0%
it's in inclusive of all parts of the
 
04:18:47.349 --> 04:18:47.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:50.710 --> 04:18:50.720 align:start position:0%
on so maybe uh if I may maybe we just
 
04:18:54.790 --> 04:18:54.800 align:start position:0%
need to um they need to right so just
 
04:18:57.109 --> 04:18:57.119 align:start position:0%
remove this de definition and instead
 
04:18:59.510 --> 04:18:59.520 align:start position:0%
use our new definition for cannabis on
 
04:19:01.590 --> 04:19:01.600 align:start position:0%
page three of the legislation I think
 
04:19:03.309 --> 04:19:03.319 align:start position:0%
that's a good idea
 
04:19:07.830 --> 04:19:07.840 align:start position:0%
yeah does that make sense yeah all right
 
04:19:10.550 --> 04:19:10.560 align:start position:0%
so on page just I'll repeat it just to
 
04:19:13.750 --> 04:19:13.760 align:start position:0%
make sure on page 30 lines five sorry
 
04:19:17.349 --> 04:19:17.359 align:start position:0%
lines 8 through 14 we would strike that
 
04:19:19.870 --> 04:19:19.880 align:start position:0%
section and and basically by reference
 
04:19:22.429 --> 04:19:22.439 align:start position:0%
we now need to reference the new
 
04:19:24.469 --> 04:19:24.479 align:start position:0%
section or
 
04:19:34.630 --> 04:19:34.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:40.429 --> 04:19:40.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:43.510 --> 04:19:43.520 align:start position:0%
you any any other comments on this
 
04:19:47.109 --> 04:19:47.119 align:start position:0%
section and maybe next next hearing if
 
04:19:49.830 --> 04:19:49.840 align:start position:0%
we can get some confirmation that would
 
04:19:52.269 --> 04:19:52.279 align:start position:0%
look at section
 
04:19:52.279 --> 04:20:05.550 align:start position:0%
look at section
B

04:20:05.550 --> 04:20:05.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:05.560 --> 04:20:18.550 align:start position:0%
 
31

04:20:18.550 --> 04:20:18.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:19.750 --> 04:20:19.760 align:start position:0%
I don't I don't think we really need to
 
04:20:21.149 --> 04:20:21.159 align:start position:0%
address this anymore this is the
 
04:20:24.269 --> 04:20:24.279 align:start position:0%
existing law and this is the for some
 
04:20:25.950 --> 04:20:25.960 align:start position:0%
under 21 this has to do with the three
 
04:20:28.870 --> 04:20:28.880 align:start position:0%
quarters announce Vision I don't think
 
04:20:35.510 --> 04:20:35.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:35.520 --> 04:20:47.790 align:start position:0%
 
either

04:20:47.790 --> 04:20:47.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:50.750 --> 04:20:50.760 align:start position:0%
um Chief any comment on on number on
 
04:20:54.870 --> 04:20:54.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:00.550 --> 04:21:00.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:05.429 --> 04:21:05.439 align:start position:0%
yes yeah page 31 line 31
 
04:21:05.439 --> 04:21:08.109 align:start position:0%
yes yeah page 31 line 31
yeah

04:21:08.109 --> 04:21:08.119 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
04:21:09.870 --> 04:21:09.880 align:start position:0%
is this the section regarding possessed
 
04:21:12.030 --> 04:21:12.040 align:start position:0%
by a person who's under 21 years of age
 
04:21:13.990 --> 04:21:14.000 align:start position:0%
or in the case of in an amount
 
04:21:16.870 --> 04:21:16.880 align:start position:0%
exceeding The Possession limit defined
 
04:21:16.880 --> 04:21:17.790 align:start position:0%
exceeding The Possession limit defined
by

04:21:17.790 --> 04:21:17.800 align:start position:0%
by
 
04:21:20.189 --> 04:21:20.199 align:start position:0%
318 DF col one is that what you're
 
04:21:24.790 --> 04:21:24.800 align:start position:0%
referring to yeah so we be so alcohol or
 
04:21:27.309 --> 04:21:27.319 align:start position:0%
drug impairment possession of
 
04:21:33.189 --> 04:21:33.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:35.950 --> 04:21:35.960 align:start position:0%
31 so again this is the existing law so
 
04:21:37.710 --> 04:21:37.720 align:start position:0%
all we're doing doing in terms of
 
04:21:39.710 --> 04:21:39.720 align:start position:0%
changing it is getting rid of that last
 
04:21:45.189 --> 04:21:45.199 align:start position:0%
sentence online 37 38 but um
 
04:21:48.710 --> 04:21:48.720 align:start position:0%
I I think because aren't we
 
04:21:51.389 --> 04:21:51.399 align:start position:0%
striking I think that our part might be
 
04:21:53.950 --> 04:21:53.960 align:start position:0%
stricken so we got to make sure here you
 
04:21:53.960 --> 04:22:05.349 align:start position:0%
stricken so we got to make sure here you
mean

04:22:05.349 --> 04:22:05.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:05.359 --> 04:22:06.870 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

04:22:06.870 --> 04:22:06.880 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
04:22:09.750 --> 04:22:09.760 align:start position:0%
Senator would we have to specify here
 
04:22:12.109 --> 04:22:12.119 align:start position:0%
that it'd be driving with possession
 
04:22:15.070 --> 04:22:15.080 align:start position:0%
while you know um outside of the
 
04:22:17.229 --> 04:22:17.239 align:start position:0%
parameters of this new code section
 
04:22:18.030 --> 04:22:18.040 align:start position:0%
something like that because we're
 
04:22:19.910 --> 04:22:19.920 align:start position:0%
striking basically most of the stuff
 
04:22:23.030 --> 04:22:23.040 align:start position:0%
under 318-b two right so that they're
 
04:22:24.630 --> 04:22:24.640 align:start position:0%
going to go there and basically be a
 
04:22:26.429 --> 04:22:26.439 align:start position:0%
repeal so we got to put that the same
 
04:22:28.790 --> 04:22:28.800 align:start position:0%
consistency you just brought up needs to
 
04:22:32.510 --> 04:22:32.520 align:start position:0%
be brought here yep so there's a cleanup
 
04:22:35.349 --> 04:22:35.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:35.359 --> 04:22:44.149 align:start position:0%
 
yes

04:22:44.149 --> 04:22:44.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:44.159 --> 04:22:53.510 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:22:53.510 --> 04:22:53.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:56.870 --> 04:22:56.880 align:start position:0%
no this is the new section are we on to
 
04:23:00.469 --> 04:23:00.479 align:start position:0%
section 15 yes this is the new section
 
04:23:04.149 --> 04:23:04.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:22.149 --> 04:23:22.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:22.159 --> 04:23:28.070 align:start position:0%
 
section

04:23:28.070 --> 04:23:28.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:29.990 --> 04:23:30.000 align:start position:0%
well everyone's good with this section
 
04:23:33.349 --> 04:23:33.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:29.870 --> 04:24:29.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:31.790 --> 04:24:31.800 align:start position:0%
yeah Mr chair um if we're on the
 
04:24:33.790 --> 04:24:33.800 align:start position:0%
analment section uh perhaps the Attorney
 
04:24:35.269 --> 04:24:35.279 align:start position:0%
General's office weigh in on the
 
04:24:35.279 --> 04:24:36.870 align:start position:0%
General's office weigh in on the
question

04:24:36.870 --> 04:24:36.880 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:24:39.510 --> 04:24:39.520 align:start position:0%
with respect to subparagraph
 
04:24:42.469 --> 04:24:42.479 align:start position:0%
B as to whether or not dismissal of
 
04:24:44.469 --> 04:24:44.479 align:start position:0%
marijuana charge would
 
04:24:46.630 --> 04:24:46.640 align:start position:0%
imperil uh
 
04:24:50.550 --> 04:24:50.560 align:start position:0%
other contemporaneous charges that uh
 
04:24:53.030 --> 04:24:53.040 align:start position:0%
were associated with an underlying
 
04:24:55.269 --> 04:24:55.279 align:start position:0%
marijuana charge is now
 
04:24:57.389 --> 04:24:57.399 align:start position:0%
dismissed particularly if it's still in
 
04:25:00.229 --> 04:25:00.239 align:start position:0%
process so for example marijuana stop
 
04:25:02.910 --> 04:25:02.920 align:start position:0%
results in the disclosure or the
 
04:25:05.070 --> 04:25:05.080 align:start position:0%
discovery of let's say a murder weapon
 
04:25:08.630 --> 04:25:08.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:09.830 --> 04:25:09.840 align:start position:0%
it sounds like the way it's written that
 
04:25:11.149 --> 04:25:11.159 align:start position:0%
someone that there's a pending
 
04:25:13.550 --> 04:25:13.560 align:start position:0%
prosecution that this would
 
04:25:16.189 --> 04:25:16.199 align:start position:0%
essentially say that they have to stop
 
04:25:18.349 --> 04:25:18.359 align:start position:0%
that in mid prosecution because the
 
04:25:20.990 --> 04:25:21.000 align:start position:0%
behavior that they were being prosecuted
 
04:25:23.710 --> 04:25:23.720 align:start position:0%
for is no longer a crime right which
 
04:25:25.189 --> 04:25:25.199 align:start position:0%
although that makes
 
04:25:28.550 --> 04:25:28.560 align:start position:0%
sense certainly makes logical
 
04:25:30.309 --> 04:25:30.319 align:start position:0%
sense I
 
04:25:32.229 --> 04:25:32.239 align:start position:0%
mean we don't normally give it a
 
04:25:33.990 --> 04:25:34.000 align:start position:0%
retroactive application like that I mean
 
04:25:34.000 --> 04:25:35.070 align:start position:0%
retroactive application like that I mean
it's

04:25:35.070 --> 04:25:35.080 align:start position:0%
it's
 
04:25:37.429 --> 04:25:37.439 align:start position:0%
still I think they'll likely be able to
 
04:25:39.349 --> 04:25:39.359 align:start position:0%
get the conviction nulled and they would
 
04:25:40.950 --> 04:25:40.960 align:start position:0%
be prosecutory discretion but do we
 
04:25:44.870 --> 04:25:44.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:47.389 --> 04:25:47.399 align:start position:0%
prosecution my opinion would be yes
 
04:25:50.429 --> 04:25:50.439 align:start position:0%
because it I it's a fundamental Fair
 
04:25:52.309 --> 04:25:52.319 align:start position:0%
fairness issue why continue a
 
04:25:53.750 --> 04:25:53.760 align:start position:0%
prosecution that's something that's not
 
04:25:57.710 --> 04:25:57.720 align:start position:0%
legal anymore or not illegal anymore I'm
 
04:25:59.550 --> 04:25:59.560 align:start position:0%
with you I think that the discretion is
 
04:26:01.550 --> 04:26:01.560 align:start position:0%
is pretty obvious but I guess
 
04:26:04.550 --> 04:26:04.560 align:start position:0%
legislating to mandate is the question
 
04:26:07.630 --> 04:26:07.640 align:start position:0%
yeah and I think it's necessary
 
04:26:09.590 --> 04:26:09.600 align:start position:0%
because even if you're you can seek an
 
04:26:11.389 --> 04:26:11.399 align:start position:0%
analment afterwards you still have to go
 
04:26:15.670 --> 04:26:15.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:26.109 --> 04:26:26.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:29.109 --> 04:26:29.119 align:start position:0%
proceeding but this is the existing law
 
04:26:31.710 --> 04:26:31.720 align:start position:0%
anyway right no this is a new section oh
 
04:26:34.990 --> 04:26:35.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:35.000 --> 04:26:38.389 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

04:26:38.389 --> 04:26:38.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:40.030 --> 04:26:40.040 align:start position:0%
I mean I think this is the middle ground
 
04:26:42.469 --> 04:26:42.479 align:start position:0%
because you know what I would prefer is
 
04:26:45.109 --> 04:26:45.119 align:start position:0%
all prior convictions of marijuana be
 
04:26:47.870 --> 04:26:47.880 align:start position:0%
eliminated we have a lot of folks in
 
04:26:50.510 --> 04:26:50.520 align:start position:0%
jail because of marijuana and you know
 
04:26:52.149 --> 04:26:52.159 align:start position:0%
we have talked about sort of the
 
04:26:52.159 --> 04:26:53.750 align:start position:0%
we have talked about sort of the
disproportionate

04:26:53.750 --> 04:26:53.760 align:start position:0%
disproportionate
 
04:26:56.469 --> 04:26:56.479 align:start position:0%
um prosecution for those crimes so I
 
04:26:58.510 --> 04:26:58.520 align:start position:0%
think this is a middle ground if there's
 
04:26:59.550 --> 04:26:59.560 align:start position:0%
just a
 
04:27:02.910 --> 04:27:02.920 align:start position:0%
current uh case that should be preceded
 
04:27:05.109 --> 04:27:05.119 align:start position:0%
so to me this is a middle ground so when
 
04:27:07.590 --> 04:27:07.600 align:start position:0%
it comes to the possession charges like
 
04:27:10.030 --> 04:27:10.040 align:start position:0%
I I think if you right now you're
 
04:27:12.030 --> 04:27:12.040 align:start position:0%
eligible for an inment if you were
 
04:27:14.349 --> 04:27:14.359 align:start position:0%
convicted of a possession charge you had
 
04:27:17.030 --> 04:27:17.040 align:start position:0%
three4 of an ounce or less I Envision
 
04:27:19.109 --> 04:27:19.119 align:start position:0%
that three4 of an ounce or less changing
 
04:27:20.990 --> 04:27:21.000 align:start position:0%
to a higher number one day I don't I
 
04:27:22.469 --> 04:27:22.479 align:start position:0%
think the en nment section can get
 
04:27:22.479 --> 04:27:24.469 align:start position:0%
think the en nment section can get
rather

04:27:24.469 --> 04:27:24.479 align:start position:0%
rather
 
04:27:27.790 --> 04:27:27.800 align:start position:0%
uh animated sometimes so I I was hoping
 
04:27:29.750 --> 04:27:29.760 align:start position:0%
that for the sake of this bill whether
 
04:27:31.990 --> 04:27:32.000 align:start position:0%
we do a state control model we can maybe
 
04:27:34.109 --> 04:27:34.119 align:start position:0%
kick that can down the road is what I
 
04:27:35.870 --> 04:27:35.880 align:start position:0%
was hoping to do when it comes to the
 
04:27:38.269 --> 04:27:38.279 align:start position:0%
inment but I I think let's say the The
 
04:27:40.030 --> 04:27:40.040 align:start position:0%
Possession limit is 2 ounces right we
 
04:27:42.070 --> 04:27:42.080 align:start position:0%
should expand the analment section to 2
 
04:27:44.389 --> 04:27:44.399 align:start position:0%
ounces consistent with the legal
 
04:27:47.030 --> 04:27:47.040 align:start position:0%
possession right I think that that makes
 
04:27:47.040 --> 04:27:51.309 align:start position:0%
possession right I think that that makes
sense

04:27:51.309 --> 04:27:51.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:53.750 --> 04:27:53.760 align:start position:0%
but I I would concur with that
 
04:27:55.149 --> 04:27:55.159 align:start position:0%
assessment because that's consistent
 
04:27:56.990 --> 04:27:57.000 align:start position:0%
with what the maximum possessory limit
 
04:27:57.000 --> 04:27:58.269 align:start position:0%
with what the maximum possessory limit
would

04:27:58.269 --> 04:27:58.279 align:start position:0%
would
 
04:28:01.229 --> 04:28:01.239 align:start position:0%
be it's previously stated in the
 
04:28:04.269 --> 04:28:04.279 align:start position:0%
proposed legislation and again careful
 
04:28:07.189 --> 04:28:07.199 align:start position:0%
to be
 
04:28:10.710 --> 04:28:10.720 align:start position:0%
uh allowing con uh en nments of
 
04:28:14.030 --> 04:28:14.040 align:start position:0%
convictions of significant quantities of
 
04:28:17.990 --> 04:28:18.000 align:start position:0%
marijuana that you don't want to have
 
04:28:19.950 --> 04:28:19.960 align:start position:0%
anull and there's no charge for the
 
04:28:21.710 --> 04:28:21.720 align:start position:0%
analment so that and that was something
 
04:28:24.269 --> 04:28:24.279 align:start position:0%
P two terms
 
04:28:28.670 --> 04:28:28.680 align:start position:0%
ago the um I think at this point a
 
04:28:30.389 --> 04:28:30.399 align:start position:0%
possession with intent to distribute
 
04:28:34.790 --> 04:28:34.800 align:start position:0%
distribution those those been those been
 
04:28:34.800 --> 04:28:36.429 align:start position:0%
distribution those those been those been
qualified

04:28:36.429 --> 04:28:36.439 align:start position:0%
qualified
 
04:28:39.429 --> 04:28:39.439 align:start position:0%
if I may yes yeah I just I feel like um
 
04:28:41.550 --> 04:28:41.560 align:start position:0%
kicking this issue if I think this is a
 
04:28:43.710 --> 04:28:43.720 align:start position:0%
fairness issue and I think this
 
04:28:46.790 --> 04:28:46.800 align:start position:0%
provision uh is very fair particularly
 
04:28:49.590 --> 04:28:49.600 align:start position:0%
if I mean this is someone just to to
 
04:28:51.429 --> 04:28:51.439 align:start position:0%
reiterate we're going to be prosecuting
 
04:28:53.109 --> 04:28:53.119 align:start position:0%
someone for something that's not illegal
 
04:28:55.590 --> 04:28:55.600 align:start position:0%
anymore right so that this is a fairness
 
04:28:57.550 --> 04:28:57.560 align:start position:0%
issue and I hear what you're saying
 
04:29:00.030 --> 04:29:00.040 align:start position:0%
about you know this being potentially a
 
04:29:02.790 --> 04:29:02.800 align:start position:0%
political hot button but I think this
 
04:29:05.349 --> 04:29:05.359 align:start position:0%
commission is trying to get the best
 
04:29:05.359 --> 04:29:06.550 align:start position:0%
commission is trying to get the best
possible

04:29:06.550 --> 04:29:06.560 align:start position:0%
possible
 
04:29:08.510 --> 04:29:08.520 align:start position:0%
package here and if that's something
 
04:29:10.510 --> 04:29:10.520 align:start position:0%
that the legislature is going to debate
 
04:29:12.670 --> 04:29:12.680 align:start position:0%
down the road let's do that but from my
 
04:29:14.149 --> 04:29:14.159 align:start position:0%
perspective as a commission looking
 
04:29:16.309 --> 04:29:16.319 align:start position:0%
holistically at the problem I think this
 
04:29:17.630 --> 04:29:17.640 align:start position:0%
is a piece of the puzzle that we can't
 
04:29:19.429 --> 04:29:19.439 align:start position:0%
ignore it's fundamental fairness it it
 
04:29:23.149 --> 04:29:23.159 align:start position:0%
is I I do agree that for any County
 
04:29:24.870 --> 04:29:24.880 align:start position:0%
attorney out there that's Prosecuting a
 
04:29:26.790 --> 04:29:26.800 align:start position:0%
claim that if you got a successful
 
04:29:28.870 --> 04:29:28.880 align:start position:0%
conviction on that that conviction would
 
04:29:30.550 --> 04:29:30.560 align:start position:0%
immediately be subject to an annulment
 
04:29:33.910 --> 04:29:33.920 align:start position:0%
is a horrible use of discretion I I just
 
04:29:36.429 --> 04:29:36.439 align:start position:0%
because literally you get the conviction
 
04:29:38.870 --> 04:29:38.880 align:start position:0%
enters then you get the analment within
 
04:29:38.880 --> 04:29:40.830 align:start position:0%
enters then you get the analment within
seconds

04:29:40.830 --> 04:29:40.840 align:start position:0%
seconds
 
04:29:42.750 --> 04:29:42.760 align:start position:0%
right yeah I very much agree with
 
04:29:45.349 --> 04:29:45.359 align:start position:0%
Senator Whitley on this um and
 
04:29:46.590 --> 04:29:46.600 align:start position:0%
particularly that it's a middle ground
 
04:29:48.229 --> 04:29:48.239 align:start position:0%
we're not talking about resentencing
 
04:29:50.389 --> 04:29:50.399 align:start position:0%
here which I think from our perspective
 
04:29:51.870 --> 04:29:51.880 align:start position:0%
would be the most appropriate thing to
 
04:29:53.870 --> 04:29:53.880 align:start position:0%
do um for all the folks who are
 
04:29:56.670 --> 04:29:56.680 align:start position:0%
currently um facing penalties or living
 
04:29:58.429 --> 04:29:58.439 align:start position:0%
through penalties because of uh what
 
04:30:02.189 --> 04:30:02.199 align:start position:0%
we'll soon hopefully soon be legal um
 
04:30:03.630 --> 04:30:03.640 align:start position:0%
and also I think there's sections in
 
04:30:04.630 --> 04:30:04.640 align:start position:0%
this that are talking about
 
04:30:06.429 --> 04:30:06.439 align:start position:0%
non-discrimination talking about you
 
04:30:09.950 --> 04:30:09.960 align:start position:0%
know access to um engage in the business
 
04:30:11.510 --> 04:30:11.520 align:start position:0%
aspect of this and so I think having the
 
04:30:13.469 --> 04:30:13.479 align:start position:0%
inment piece as part of this ensuring
 
04:30:15.030 --> 04:30:15.040 align:start position:0%
that folks have clean records so that we
 
04:30:17.429 --> 04:30:17.439 align:start position:0%
go through this whole process um with
 
04:30:20.710 --> 04:30:20.720 align:start position:0%
the Clean Slate I think is important um
 
04:30:22.389 --> 04:30:22.399 align:start position:0%
and also just this the straight fact
 
04:30:25.429 --> 04:30:25.439 align:start position:0%
that having a criminal conviction um
 
04:30:27.990 --> 04:30:28.000 align:start position:0%
impacts housing impacts employment Etc
 
04:30:30.349 --> 04:30:30.359 align:start position:0%
so I think the faster we can fix that um
 
04:30:33.070 --> 04:30:33.080 align:start position:0%
what your showns have I'm I'm I'm with
 
04:30:34.349 --> 04:30:34.359 align:start position:0%
you on that I just want to make sure
 
04:30:38.269 --> 04:30:38.279 align:start position:0%
this doesn't apply this would apply to
 
04:30:40.790 --> 04:30:40.800 align:start position:0%
manufacturing right so if someone's
 
04:30:43.070 --> 04:30:43.080 align:start position:0%
illegally Manu is in
 
04:30:46.070 --> 04:30:46.080 align:start position:0%
manufacturing I'm I'm not really sure
 
04:30:48.750 --> 04:30:48.760 align:start position:0%
get into anymore but you know you get
 
04:30:50.950 --> 04:30:50.960 align:start position:0%
what I'm saying right if someone's
 
04:30:54.229 --> 04:30:54.239 align:start position:0%
transporting basically large quantities
 
04:30:56.630 --> 04:30:56.640 align:start position:0%
right you know someone has an 18wheeler
 
04:30:58.710 --> 04:30:58.720 align:start position:0%
full of cannabis like we're we're
 
04:31:01.070 --> 04:31:01.080 align:start position:0%
talking like that to me falls under you
 
04:31:05.070 --> 04:31:05.080 align:start position:0%
I I think that is one issue the simple
 
04:31:06.870 --> 04:31:06.880 align:start position:0%
possession charges at the lower level
 
04:31:09.030 --> 04:31:09.040 align:start position:0%
that's the stuff that's I'm I'm with you
 
04:31:10.910 --> 04:31:10.920 align:start position:0%
so do we just need to clean that up to
 
04:31:12.630 --> 04:31:12.640 align:start position:0%
exclude perhaps
 
04:31:16.030 --> 04:31:16.040 align:start position:0%
the you know the Kingpin from this Am I
 
04:31:17.149 --> 04:31:17.159 align:start position:0%
Wrong Am I Wrong Am I reading this
 
04:31:17.159 --> 04:31:18.670 align:start position:0%
Wrong Am I Wrong Am I reading this
incorrectly

04:31:18.670 --> 04:31:18.680 align:start position:0%
incorrectly
 
04:31:21.750 --> 04:31:21.760 align:start position:0%
any I I agree with you Senator
 
04:31:25.109 --> 04:31:25.119 align:start position:0%
that you should handle these simple
 
04:31:27.149 --> 04:31:27.159 align:start position:0%
possession charges which I think it's a
 
04:31:28.870 --> 04:31:28.880 align:start position:0%
myth that we have all these people in
 
04:31:30.830 --> 04:31:30.840 align:start position:0%
jail and I would love love to hear from
 
04:31:32.429 --> 04:31:32.439 align:start position:0%
the AG's office how many people we
 
04:31:34.670 --> 04:31:34.680 align:start position:0%
actually have currently in incarcerated
 
04:31:36.750 --> 04:31:36.760 align:start position:0%
for a simple possession charges if you
 
04:31:38.950 --> 04:31:38.960 align:start position:0%
have that
 
04:31:41.269 --> 04:31:41.279 align:start position:0%
stat I I don't have those numbers it's
 
04:31:41.279 --> 04:31:44.510 align:start position:0%
stat I I don't have those numbers it's
not

04:31:44.510 --> 04:31:44.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:48.309 --> 04:31:48.319 align:start position:0%
many it's by manufacturing
 
04:31:51.670 --> 04:31:51.680 align:start position:0%
right it doesn't say cultivating it we
 
04:31:51.680 --> 04:31:52.830 align:start position:0%
right it doesn't say cultivating it we
from

04:31:52.830 --> 04:31:52.840 align:start position:0%
from
 
04:31:54.870 --> 04:31:54.880 align:start position:0%
represent my friend from Hudson that
 
04:31:57.830 --> 04:31:57.840 align:start position:0%
there is a difference so manufacturing
 
04:32:00.030 --> 04:32:00.040 align:start position:0%
yes manufacturing is included in there
 
04:32:01.950 --> 04:32:01.960 align:start position:0%
uh but it also appears to be qualified
 
04:32:03.469 --> 04:32:03.479 align:start position:0%
No More Than The Possession limit of
 
04:32:05.990 --> 04:32:06.000 align:start position:0%
cannabis where the offense occur prior
 
04:32:08.590 --> 04:32:08.600 align:start position:0%
to the statute going into effect that
 
04:32:10.070 --> 04:32:10.080 align:start position:0%
possession limit means The Possession
 
04:32:13.309 --> 04:32:13.319 align:start position:0%
limit as defined I I think that's
 
04:32:15.389 --> 04:32:15.399 align:start position:0%
pointing to the provision earlier in
 
04:32:17.870 --> 04:32:17.880 align:start position:0%
this section here it's not the same
 
04:32:19.469 --> 04:32:19.479 align:start position:0%
provision so that may be a clerical
 
04:32:22.349 --> 04:32:22.359 align:start position:0%
error um in terms of what sub paragraph
 
04:32:23.349 --> 04:32:23.359 align:start position:0%
It's pointing
 
04:32:26.910 --> 04:32:26.920 align:start position:0%
to but that may be the personal
 
04:32:30.030 --> 04:32:30.040 align:start position:0%
possession limit that's articulated on
 
04:32:32.269 --> 04:32:32.279 align:start position:0%
page three
 
04:32:32.279 --> 04:32:33.990 align:start position:0%
page three
um

04:32:33.990 --> 04:32:34.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:32:37.349 --> 04:32:37.359 align:start position:0%
or on page P five of the bill line
 
04:32:41.349 --> 04:32:41.359 align:start position:0%
26 if that citation is a clerical error
 
04:32:42.550 --> 04:32:42.560 align:start position:0%
so if you were doing if you were
 
04:32:45.149 --> 04:32:45.159 align:start position:0%
transporting manufacturing but you're
 
04:32:47.790 --> 04:32:47.800 align:start position:0%
under the you had three qu oun or less
 
04:32:50.750 --> 04:32:50.760 align:start position:0%
so we're not talking about the 18 milon
 
04:32:53.550 --> 04:32:53.560 align:start position:0%
correct okay good thank
 
04:32:57.510 --> 04:32:57.520 align:start position:0%
you with that as long as we have the
 
04:32:59.550 --> 04:32:59.560 align:start position:0%
appropriate uh
 
04:33:01.630 --> 04:33:01.640 align:start position:0%
reference yeah maybe I think so that's
 
04:33:03.150 --> 04:33:03.160 align:start position:0%
what I was trying to figure out if
 
04:33:06.429 --> 04:33:06.439 align:start position:0%
that's yeah but if that's intended to be
 
04:33:11.310 --> 04:33:11.320 align:start position:0%
pointing to the new possession limit uh
 
04:33:21.789 --> 04:33:21.799 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:24.510 --> 04:33:24.520 align:start position:0%
y right everyone's if everyone's anyone
 
04:33:25.830 --> 04:33:25.840 align:start position:0%
against that just raise your hand for
 
04:33:34.349 --> 04:33:34.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:34.359 --> 04:33:53.429 align:start position:0%
 
read

04:33:53.429 --> 04:33:53.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:04.269 --> 04:34:04.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:04.279 --> 04:34:05.830 align:start position:0%
 
three

04:34:05.830 --> 04:34:05.840 align:start position:0%
three
 
04:34:11.709 --> 04:34:11.719 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:14.230 --> 04:34:14.240 align:start position:0%
right the only issue of paragraph three
 
04:34:16.869 --> 04:34:16.879 align:start position:0%
is that it automatically vacates so so
 
04:34:19.510 --> 04:34:19.520 align:start position:0%
this is it automatically vacates the
 
04:34:21.869 --> 04:34:21.879 align:start position:0%
conviction all right in order for that
 
04:34:22.830 --> 04:34:22.840 align:start position:0%
to be
 
04:34:27.750 --> 04:34:27.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:31.029 --> 04:34:31.039 align:start position:0%
issue the legislator can't
 
04:34:33.510 --> 04:34:33.520 align:start position:0%
vacate the conviction we had that with
 
04:34:37.269 --> 04:34:37.279 align:start position:0%
another analment bill
 
04:34:41.189 --> 04:34:41.199 align:start position:0%
it's the bill involving the uh
 
04:34:43.750 --> 04:34:43.760 align:start position:0%
um with the the Witchcraft D and
 
04:34:45.670 --> 04:34:45.680 align:start position:0%
criminal justice public that that point
 
04:34:48.269 --> 04:34:48.279 align:start position:0%
we had in Sate Judiciary this year so I
 
04:34:51.390 --> 04:34:51.400 align:start position:0%
think paragraph three right now for the
 
04:34:53.510 --> 04:34:53.520 align:start position:0%
The Possession for an analment a person
 
04:34:56.709 --> 04:34:56.719 align:start position:0%
just has to apply and I'm not sure if it
 
04:34:58.990 --> 04:34:59.000 align:start position:0%
can be done administratively I know self
 
04:35:01.349 --> 04:35:01.359 align:start position:0%
board and Massachusetts it can be done
 
04:35:03.349 --> 04:35:03.359 align:start position:0%
administratively but the court could at
 
04:35:06.590 --> 04:35:06.600 align:start position:0%
their discretion schedule a hearing
 
04:35:08.949 --> 04:35:08.959 align:start position:0%
but this says it's automatically vacated
 
04:35:10.429 --> 04:35:10.439 align:start position:0%
without any finding to make sure that
 
04:35:13.390 --> 04:35:13.400 align:start position:0%
they even qualify a you
 
04:35:15.470 --> 04:35:15.480 align:start position:0%
know there's no charge for the
 
04:35:17.429 --> 04:35:17.439 align:start position:0%
application in New Hampshire I remember
 
04:35:18.869 --> 04:35:18.879 align:start position:0%
I wanted I was actually against getting
 
04:35:22.070 --> 04:35:22.080 align:start position:0%
rid of the the $100 fee but it's I lost
 
04:35:25.029 --> 04:35:25.039 align:start position:0%
out but to automatically do
 
04:35:28.709 --> 04:35:28.719 align:start position:0%
it I mean that's a lot
 
04:35:28.719 --> 04:35:34.189 align:start position:0%
it I mean that's a lot
of

04:35:34.189 --> 04:35:34.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:34.199 --> 04:35:41.789 align:start position:0%
 
May

04:35:41.789 --> 04:35:41.799 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:43.990 --> 04:35:44.000 align:start position:0%
well but it says that it's it's vacated
 
04:35:45.629 --> 04:35:45.639 align:start position:0%
by operational
 
04:35:48.150 --> 04:35:48.160 align:start position:0%
law right and I I think that's because
 
04:35:49.551 --> 04:35:49.561 align:start position:0%
we're talking
 
04:35:53.269 --> 04:35:53.279 align:start position:0%
about a crime that's not a crime
 
04:35:55.750 --> 04:35:55.760 align:start position:0%
anymore yes but I'm just saying for
 
04:35:57.390 --> 04:35:57.400 align:start position:0%
every other analment section I mean
 
04:35:58.830 --> 04:35:58.840 align:start position:0%
witchcraft is not a crimeal either so we
 
04:36:00.869 --> 04:36:00.879 align:start position:0%
don't we can't just retroactively can
 
04:36:03.510 --> 04:36:03.520 align:start position:0%
the legislator actually vacate a
 
04:36:05.390 --> 04:36:05.400 align:start position:0%
conviction by the court like when
 
04:36:06.590 --> 04:36:06.600 align:start position:0%
there's a when there's an a state of
 
04:36:08.709 --> 04:36:08.719 align:start position:0%
emergency the court technically doesn't
 
04:36:11.629 --> 04:36:11.639 align:start position:0%
have to listen to the executive order
 
04:36:13.709 --> 04:36:13.719 align:start position:0%
neither does the legislative brige so
 
04:36:15.629 --> 04:36:15.639 align:start position:0%
they tend to line up correctly they tend
 
04:36:18.789 --> 04:36:18.799 align:start position:0%
to all work together quite well but
 
04:36:20.670 --> 04:36:20.680 align:start position:0%
that's more out of cooperation than
 
04:36:23.150 --> 04:36:23.160 align:start position:0%
Mandy is it what's your proposal I'm
 
04:36:25.029 --> 04:36:25.039 align:start position:0%
just I I'm just explaining that
 
04:36:27.189 --> 04:36:27.199 align:start position:0%
mandating that it be vacated is that an
 
04:36:30.349 --> 04:36:30.359 align:start position:0%
issue we can do that yeah and we have in
 
04:36:30.359 --> 04:36:32.629 align:start position:0%
issue we can do that yeah and we have in
other

04:36:32.629 --> 04:36:32.639 align:start position:0%
other
 
04:36:35.269 --> 04:36:35.279 align:start position:0%
areas okay I'm not sure it was
 
04:36:38.029 --> 04:36:38.039 align:start position:0%
constitutional men and was we're no
 
04:36:41.869 --> 04:36:41.879 align:start position:0%
we're the legislature is the general
 
04:36:44.830 --> 04:36:44.840 align:start position:0%
court Massachusetts calls it the great
 
04:36:47.830 --> 04:36:47.840 align:start position:0%
and general court we are the
 
04:36:50.310 --> 04:36:50.320 align:start position:0%
ultimate and we're for a long time the
 
04:36:56.310 --> 04:36:56.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:58.590 --> 04:36:58.600 align:start position:0%
law okay all right we're good I'm
 
04:37:01.709 --> 04:37:01.719 align:start position:0%
outnumbered anyway so and and
 
04:37:05.670 --> 04:37:05.680 align:start position:0%
if we are numbered anyway we can move on
 
04:37:09.070 --> 04:37:09.080 align:start position:0%
um zero Senator sorry on that um are
 
04:37:10.470 --> 04:37:10.480 align:start position:0%
there any issues too with criminal
 
04:37:13.310 --> 04:37:13.320 align:start position:0%
records and uh making sure that the
 
04:37:16.709 --> 04:37:16.719 align:start position:0%
court is talking to police or whoever
 
04:37:18.310 --> 04:37:18.320 align:start position:0%
have crime records as well and making
 
04:37:21.109 --> 04:37:21.119 align:start position:0%
sure that it's fully cleaned
 
04:37:24.189 --> 04:37:24.199 align:start position:0%
up there should be I know in the the
 
04:37:26.949 --> 04:37:26.959 align:start position:0%
analment language from the other it's in
 
04:37:29.551 --> 04:37:29.561 align:start position:0%
there because part of the analment is it
 
04:37:31.910 --> 04:37:31.920 align:start position:0%
it's sealed from all ways of finding the
 
04:37:33.310 --> 04:37:33.320 align:start position:0%
only the only thing would remain if
 
04:37:35.910 --> 04:37:35.920 align:start position:0%
there any news articles online otherwise
 
04:37:37.109 --> 04:37:37.119 align:start position:0%
that would
 
04:37:39.629 --> 04:37:39.639 align:start position:0%
include uh making sure it's not
 
04:37:42.789 --> 04:37:42.799 align:start position:0%
accessible to the public police
 
04:37:49.869 --> 04:37:49.879 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:52.590 --> 04:37:52.600 align:start position:0%
time would you want to add that to this
 
04:37:55.269 --> 04:37:55.279 align:start position:0%
yes so what I would homework assignment
 
04:37:57.349 --> 04:37:57.359 align:start position:0%
is look for the other RSA and you want
 
04:38:03.910 --> 04:38:03.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:03.920 --> 04:38:06.189 align:start position:0%
 
consistent

04:38:06.189 --> 04:38:06.199 align:start position:0%
consistent
 
04:38:06.199 --> 04:38:07.990 align:start position:0%
consistent
thank

04:38:07.990 --> 04:38:08.000 align:start position:0%
thank
 
04:38:08.000 --> 04:38:09.629 align:start position:0%
thank
you

04:38:09.629 --> 04:38:09.639 align:start position:0%
you
 
04:38:12.429 --> 04:38:12.439 align:start position:0%
now it comes this has to do with the
 
04:38:15.551 --> 04:38:15.561 align:start position:0%
revenue side of things before we debate
 
04:38:18.910 --> 04:38:18.920 align:start position:0%
that my only take on that is no matter
 
04:38:19.830 --> 04:38:19.840 align:start position:0%
what happens we're not going to all
 
04:38:21.590 --> 04:38:21.600 align:start position:0%
agree that's a that's really for the
 
04:38:24.189 --> 04:38:24.199 align:start position:0%
ways and means Comm to do I think for
 
04:38:25.510 --> 04:38:25.520 align:start position:0%
the sake of whether there's a state run
 
04:38:27.709 --> 04:38:27.719 align:start position:0%
model we don't we can we should punt on
 
04:38:33.910 --> 04:38:33.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:33.920 --> 04:38:37.750 align:start position:0%
 
that

04:38:37.750 --> 04:38:37.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:39.750 --> 04:38:39.760 align:start position:0%
well I would say to the extent that
 
04:38:39.760 --> 04:38:40.830 align:start position:0%
well I would say to the extent that
there's

04:38:40.830 --> 04:38:40.840 align:start position:0%
there's
 
04:38:43.910 --> 04:38:43.920 align:start position:0%
policy decisions within this Revenue
 
04:38:45.670 --> 04:38:45.680 align:start position:0%
section we should
 
04:38:47.709 --> 04:38:47.719 align:start position:0%
discuss anything specific that you want
 
04:38:49.670 --> 04:38:49.680 align:start position:0%
to reference I just I know some not
 
04:38:52.990 --> 04:38:53.000 align:start position:0%
everyone agreed on the some of the
 
04:38:55.390 --> 04:38:55.400 align:start position:0%
revenue going to the um Statewide
 
04:38:57.590 --> 04:38:57.600 align:start position:0%
education property taxs well we actually
 
04:38:59.310 --> 04:38:59.320 align:start position:0%
went through that no concerns were
 
04:39:02.029 --> 04:39:02.039 align:start position:0%
raised so if we so we went through
 
04:39:05.949 --> 04:39:05.959 align:start position:0%
Senator on page
 
04:39:09.390 --> 04:39:09.400 align:start position:0%
we went through um starting on page 27
 
04:39:13.230 --> 04:39:13.240 align:start position:0%
we went through all of that all right
 
04:39:15.109 --> 04:39:15.119 align:start position:0%
everyone's in board all
 
04:39:15.119 --> 04:39:17.230 align:start position:0%
everyone's in board all
right

04:39:17.230 --> 04:39:17.240 align:start position:0%
right
 
04:39:22.670 --> 04:39:22.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:25.189 --> 04:39:25.199 align:start position:0%
good excuse
 
04:39:29.869 --> 04:39:29.879 align:start position:0%
me in Senator y we we did leave off uh
 
04:39:31.990 --> 04:39:32.000 align:start position:0%
on that page I I just wanted to make a
 
04:39:33.869 --> 04:39:33.879 align:start position:0%
comment uh I thought I was going to be
 
04:39:35.830 --> 04:39:35.840 align:start position:0%
making it when when when we come back
 
04:39:38.590 --> 04:39:38.600 align:start position:0%
that the revenue splits that we went
 
04:39:42.510 --> 04:39:42.520 align:start position:0%
over what was on page 27
 
04:39:45.350 --> 04:39:45.360 align:start position:0%
27 if you look at all the different
 
04:39:48.708 --> 04:39:48.718 align:start position:0%
percentages um I I think that the
 
04:39:51.550 --> 04:39:51.560 align:start position:0%
percentage going to to the treatment
 
04:39:53.910 --> 04:39:53.920 align:start position:0%
prevention and
 
04:39:57.470 --> 04:39:57.480 align:start position:0%
uh recovery side should be a lot lot
 
04:40:01.190 --> 04:40:01.200 align:start position:0%
larger than what we looking at the split
 
04:40:05.510 --> 04:40:05.520 align:start position:0%
um when when Dr Silver spoke I think she
 
04:40:07.910 --> 04:40:07.920 align:start position:0%
was talking about uh rule of thumb was
 
04:40:09.708 --> 04:40:09.718 align:start position:0%
that out of all revenues that are
 
04:40:13.430 --> 04:40:13.440 align:start position:0%
collected what is it 30% should be going
 
04:40:18.708 --> 04:40:18.718 align:start position:0%
to uh fixing or trying to uh manage the
 
04:40:21.868 --> 04:40:21.878 align:start position:0%
harms that you know legalize a marijuana
 
04:40:25.868 --> 04:40:25.878 align:start position:0%
costs so so so I I agree with you on a
 
04:40:29.230 --> 04:40:29.240 align:start position:0%
on a principal basis when I put the bill
 
04:40:33.070 --> 04:40:33.080 align:start position:0%
in last term in the house the original
 
04:40:34.990 --> 04:40:35.000 align:start position:0%
Revenue share I had was the first
 
04:40:38.510 --> 04:40:38.520 align:start position:0%
million in net revenue would go towards
 
04:40:41.030 --> 04:40:41.040 align:start position:0%
go to DHHS for drug treatment programs
 
04:40:44.868 --> 04:40:44.878 align:start position:0%
and you know it's a long a bunch of sub
 
04:40:47.030 --> 04:40:47.040 align:start position:0%
inclusions in there and then then there
 
04:40:49.990 --> 04:40:50.000 align:start position:0%
was the split otherwise the problem was
 
04:40:53.470 --> 04:40:53.480 align:start position:0%
was that I didn't really get much um
 
04:40:56.270 --> 04:40:56.280 align:start position:0%
support I guess testimony and support of
 
04:40:59.628 --> 04:40:59.638 align:start position:0%
DHHS justifying that expenditure meaning
 
04:41:01.190 --> 04:41:01.200 align:start position:0%
if they came to the committee and
 
04:41:02.510 --> 04:41:02.520 align:start position:0%
explained what that money would be used
 
04:41:06.350 --> 04:41:06.360 align:start position:0%
for it's $25 million a year and explain
 
04:41:07.590 --> 04:41:07.600 align:start position:0%
all the the things that could be done
 
04:41:09.910 --> 04:41:09.920 align:start position:0%
with it that was where that kind of sank
 
04:41:13.190 --> 04:41:13.200 align:start position:0%
so that they reduced it to about 10%
 
04:41:17.190 --> 04:41:17.200 align:start position:0%
which um might not have been as as much
 
04:41:20.230 --> 04:41:20.240 align:start position:0%
revenue to them but so I guess my
 
04:41:21.708 --> 04:41:21.718 align:start position:0%
question just when it gets to the
 
04:41:22.868 --> 04:41:22.878 align:start position:0%
politics and the legislator they're
 
04:41:23.830 --> 04:41:23.840 align:start position:0%
going to want to say all right you're
 
04:41:26.390 --> 04:41:26.400 align:start position:0%
giving x amount what are they going to
 
04:41:28.868 --> 04:41:28.878 align:start position:0%
use it for they need they need to come
 
04:41:30.070 --> 04:41:30.080 align:start position:0%
they need to come in and explain to
 
04:41:31.708 --> 04:41:31.718 align:start position:0%
everyone and sell it because I I a good
 
04:41:37.350 --> 04:41:37.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:41.470 --> 04:41:41.480 align:start position:0%
just following up on that uh 80% of the
 
04:41:42.788 --> 04:41:42.798 align:start position:0%
the allocations here would be to
 
04:41:44.990 --> 04:41:45.000 align:start position:0%
non-public health or Public Safety
 
04:41:48.750 --> 04:41:48.760 align:start position:0%
amount um so just refining that a little
 
04:41:51.270 --> 04:41:51.280 align:start position:0%
bit more if it's the the take from this
 
04:41:54.510 --> 04:41:54.520 align:start position:0%
is 15% then that would be 3% of the the
 
04:41:57.310 --> 04:41:57.320 align:start position:0%
total commercial activity would be set
 
04:42:00.070 --> 04:42:00.080 align:start position:0%
aside for public health and Public
 
04:42:01.590 --> 04:42:01.600 align:start position:0%
Safety so that would be an order
 
04:42:03.788 --> 04:42:03.798 align:start position:0%
magnitude different than what Dr Silver
 
04:42:05.110 --> 04:42:05.120 align:start position:0%
had had referenced
 
04:42:07.868 --> 04:42:07.878 align:start position:0%
would also note that there there aren't
 
04:42:07.878 --> 04:42:09.390 align:start position:0%
would also note that there there aren't
other

04:42:09.390 --> 04:42:09.400 align:start position:0%
other
 
04:42:13.628 --> 04:42:13.638 align:start position:0%
um aspects here uh that would probably
 
04:42:15.590 --> 04:42:15.600 align:start position:0%
demand additional funding if the
 
04:42:17.230 --> 04:42:17.240 align:start position:0%
enforcement is supposed to be here so
 
04:42:19.390 --> 04:42:19.400 align:start position:0%
for example the state lab there's there
 
04:42:20.910 --> 04:42:20.920 align:start position:0%
is no funding additional funding here
 
04:42:23.750 --> 04:42:23.760 align:start position:0%
for the state lab there is some the 5%
 
04:42:27.270 --> 04:42:27.280 align:start position:0%
um set aside for the Dr and aide uh
 
04:42:30.110 --> 04:42:30.120 align:start position:0%
training um if the enforcement
 
04:42:32.830 --> 04:42:32.840 align:start position:0%
mechanisms that are included here would
 
04:42:35.788 --> 04:42:35.798 align:start position:0%
be envisioning additional testing than
 
04:42:38.590 --> 04:42:38.600 align:start position:0%
that the lab wouldn't be able to handle
 
04:42:40.550 --> 04:42:40.560 align:start position:0%
that without additional resources and so
 
04:42:43.708 --> 04:42:43.718 align:start position:0%
maybe on that issue um
 
04:42:46.030 --> 04:42:46.040 align:start position:0%
maybe if you wanted to work with the
 
04:42:48.310 --> 04:42:48.320 align:start position:0%
various departments and looking I mean
 
04:42:49.990 --> 04:42:50.000 align:start position:0%
you could present a proposal I think to
 
04:42:52.030 --> 04:42:52.040 align:start position:0%
the commission for adjusting the
 
04:42:53.590 --> 04:42:53.600 align:start position:0%
percentages I think that might make a
 
04:42:55.230 --> 04:42:55.240 align:start position:0%
lot of
 
04:42:58.910 --> 04:42:58.920 align:start position:0%
sense what and I think letting that be
 
04:43:00.230 --> 04:43:00.240 align:start position:0%
fought out in way and they going have to
 
04:43:01.270 --> 04:43:01.280 align:start position:0%
fight it out again in way and means
 
04:43:02.948 --> 04:43:02.958 align:start position:0%
anyway is my point but I don't think
 
04:43:04.708 --> 04:43:04.718 align:start position:0%
anyone's wrong what they're saying I
 
04:43:06.990 --> 04:43:07.000 align:start position:0%
don't either but I would but and I I
 
04:43:09.390 --> 04:43:09.400 align:start position:0%
guess from a policy perspective I would
 
04:43:11.750 --> 04:43:11.760 align:start position:0%
like to hear sort of what the state
 
04:43:13.150 --> 04:43:13.160 align:start position:0%
thought was an
 
04:43:16.070 --> 04:43:16.080 align:start position:0%
appropriate amount
 
04:43:20.190 --> 04:43:20.200 align:start position:0%
sen if I can regarding regarding the fee
 
04:43:21.708 --> 04:43:21.718 align:start position:0%
for the labs and everything the
 
04:43:23.708 --> 04:43:23.718 align:start position:0%
manufacturer is going to pay for some of
 
04:43:26.628 --> 04:43:26.638 align:start position:0%
this as well and that's a factor that
 
04:43:28.830 --> 04:43:28.840 align:start position:0%
hasn't been taken into the cost of of of
 
04:43:32.910 --> 04:43:32.920 align:start position:0%
the labs there's going to be a a charge
 
04:43:35.030 --> 04:43:35.040 align:start position:0%
to the manufacturer
 
04:43:38.030 --> 04:43:38.040 align:start position:0%
for the testing and that should cover a
 
04:43:41.948 --> 04:43:41.958 align:start position:0%
good section of it the uh
 
04:43:44.390 --> 04:43:44.400 align:start position:0%
presumed massive amount of testing
 
04:43:46.070 --> 04:43:46.080 align:start position:0%
that's going to take
 
04:43:50.150 --> 04:43:50.160 align:start position:0%
place may be a little
 
04:43:50.160 --> 04:43:51.910 align:start position:0%
place may be a little
um

04:43:51.910 --> 04:43:51.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:43:54.670 --> 04:43:54.680 align:start position:0%
enthusiastically described because
 
04:43:56.510 --> 04:43:56.520 align:start position:0%
people are now going to be getting a
 
04:44:00.030 --> 04:44:00.040 align:start position:0%
product from a secure
 
04:44:02.830 --> 04:44:02.840 align:start position:0%
establishment and the tracking of the
 
04:44:05.470 --> 04:44:05.480 align:start position:0%
that particular product is being done by
 
04:44:07.230 --> 04:44:07.240 align:start position:0%
the the coding that we talked about when
 
04:44:08.788 --> 04:44:08.798 align:start position:0%
we were talking them in the tracking
 
04:44:11.070 --> 04:44:11.080 align:start position:0%
section so the lab's not going to get
 
04:44:13.150 --> 04:44:13.160 align:start position:0%
involved in that unless the end the
 
04:44:17.030 --> 04:44:17.040 align:start position:0%
product that is uh found at the scene of
 
04:44:20.510 --> 04:44:20.520 align:start position:0%
a anciliary crime or a motor vehicle
 
04:44:22.868 --> 04:44:22.878 align:start position:0%
incident or something like that uh
 
04:44:25.550 --> 04:44:25.560 align:start position:0%
doesn't match up with the tracking
 
04:44:28.670 --> 04:44:28.680 align:start position:0%
number that would be on the packaging so
 
04:44:30.628 --> 04:44:30.638 align:start position:0%
that would that would cause the lab to
 
04:44:31.910 --> 04:44:31.920 align:start position:0%
get involved but the lab would be
 
04:44:34.948 --> 04:44:34.958 align:start position:0%
involved in that in any case
 
04:44:38.190 --> 04:44:38.200 align:start position:0%
so it's not in addition to normal
 
04:44:42.030 --> 04:44:42.040 align:start position:0%
use it's I think that the the concern
 
04:44:45.550 --> 04:44:45.560 align:start position:0%
about funding the lab is a
 
04:44:45.560 --> 04:44:47.230 align:start position:0%
about funding the lab is a
little

04:44:47.230 --> 04:44:47.240 align:start position:0%
little
 
04:44:50.190 --> 04:44:50.200 align:start position:0%
little misplaced one of the concerns
 
04:44:52.670 --> 04:44:52.680 align:start position:0%
with the lab funding was you didn't want
 
04:44:54.070 --> 04:44:54.080 align:start position:0%
when you have prosecutions for that you
 
04:44:56.590 --> 04:44:56.600 align:start position:0%
know opioids or you know whatever those
 
04:44:59.670 --> 04:44:59.680 align:start position:0%
labs are already behind schedule so
 
04:45:03.190 --> 04:45:03.200 align:start position:0%
adding cannabis to that we hoping to not
 
04:45:05.550 --> 04:45:05.560 align:start position:0%
overcrowded so if they the state wishes
 
04:45:08.510 --> 04:45:08.520 align:start position:0%
to engage in their to have their backup
 
04:45:10.910 --> 04:45:10.920 align:start position:0%
testing in well the state's going to be
 
04:45:13.030 --> 04:45:13.040 align:start position:0%
engaged in that anyways so as a followup
 
04:45:15.270 --> 04:45:15.280 align:start position:0%
to the commercial lab testing that's
 
04:45:17.948 --> 04:45:17.958 align:start position:0%
going to be taking place and in addition
 
04:45:20.750 --> 04:45:20.760 align:start position:0%
the state is always uh uh can engage in
 
04:45:25.190 --> 04:45:25.200 align:start position:0%
the business of uh charging for uh it's
 
04:45:28.390 --> 04:45:28.400 align:start position:0%
fee in the labs however it seems to me
 
04:45:31.350 --> 04:45:31.360 align:start position:0%
that uh using this as a justification
 
04:45:33.750 --> 04:45:33.760 align:start position:0%
for more money is a little disingenuous
 
04:45:36.510 --> 04:45:36.520 align:start position:0%
when you can say the state is behind in
 
04:45:38.550 --> 04:45:38.560 align:start position:0%
our testing because we don't have enough
 
04:45:42.590 --> 04:45:42.600 align:start position:0%
man uh Manpower or person power we don't
 
04:45:44.150 --> 04:45:44.160 align:start position:0%
have enough equipment we don't have
 
04:45:49.590 --> 04:45:49.600 align:start position:0%
enough um facility to to handle the the
 
04:45:52.030 --> 04:45:52.040 align:start position:0%
DraStic increase that I think
 
04:45:53.390 --> 04:45:53.400 align:start position:0%
particularly when we're dealing with the
 
04:45:56.708 --> 04:45:56.718 align:start position:0%
opio crisis that's going on has a a
 
04:45:56.718 --> 04:45:57.670 align:start position:0%
opio crisis that's going on has a a
stronger

04:45:57.670 --> 04:45:57.680 align:start position:0%
stronger
 
04:46:00.070 --> 04:46:00.080 align:start position:0%
appeal remember this is all a political
 
04:46:02.430 --> 04:46:02.440 align:start position:0%
appeal so if you're going to do it that
 
04:46:06.190 --> 04:46:06.200 align:start position:0%
way do it that way just I had to I had
 
04:46:08.708 --> 04:46:08.718 align:start position:0%
the opportunity uh during the break to
 
04:46:12.270 --> 04:46:12.280 align:start position:0%
talk to uh the director of the lab and I
 
04:46:33.190 --> 04:46:33.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:33.200 --> 04:46:52.670 align:start position:0%
 
enforc

04:46:52.670 --> 04:46:52.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:55.070 --> 04:46:55.080 align:start position:0%
and and just one other point
 
04:47:00.230 --> 04:47:00.240 align:start position:0%
was to have to have the prevention side
 
04:47:03.670 --> 04:47:03.680 align:start position:0%
of things have to justify the amount I
 
04:47:05.510 --> 04:47:05.520 align:start position:0%
think we it the wrong way because we're
 
04:47:08.548 --> 04:47:08.558 align:start position:0%
not we're not looking at what we're not
 
04:47:10.110 --> 04:47:10.120 align:start position:0%
looking the same way when we're saying
 
04:47:12.150 --> 04:47:12.160 align:start position:0%
about the retirement or or the
 
04:47:14.510 --> 04:47:14.520 align:start position:0%
educational fund um I think what we
 
04:47:16.788 --> 04:47:16.798 align:start position:0%
should do is leave that as we discussed
 
04:47:18.868 --> 04:47:18.878 align:start position:0%
at an earlier meeting to the governor's
 
04:47:20.948 --> 04:47:20.958 align:start position:0%
Commission on Alcohol and Other Drugs
 
04:47:22.788 --> 04:47:22.798 align:start position:0%
for them to decide what would be best
 
04:47:24.990 --> 04:47:25.000 align:start position:0%
for our state to use that money and I'm
 
04:47:27.430 --> 04:47:27.440 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm positive they would tell you
 
04:47:30.190 --> 04:47:30.200 align:start position:0%
that uh they there's many uses for that
 
04:47:32.830 --> 04:47:32.840 align:start position:0%
money and that uh it's it's not going to
 
04:47:34.230 --> 04:47:34.240 align:start position:0%
be like they're going to have too much
 
04:47:36.070 --> 04:47:36.080 align:start position:0%
and have a
 
04:47:46.030 --> 04:47:46.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:49.548 --> 04:47:49.558 align:start position:0%
you just a a quick I gu qualification
 
04:47:51.628 --> 04:47:51.638 align:start position:0%
less to the commercial testing of of
 
04:47:54.150 --> 04:47:54.160 align:start position:0%
product and more to
 
04:47:58.110 --> 04:47:58.120 align:start position:0%
the envisioned Demand on on labs for
 
04:48:01.350 --> 04:48:01.360 align:start position:0%
testing um samples relating to
 
04:48:03.590 --> 04:48:03.600 align:start position:0%
prosecution so if the assumption is that
 
04:48:05.070 --> 04:48:05.080 align:start position:0%
there will be no increased consumption
 
04:48:07.510 --> 04:48:07.520 align:start position:0%
in the state and impaired driving won't
 
04:48:10.708 --> 04:48:10.718 align:start position:0%
increase at all under under this then
 
04:48:12.990 --> 04:48:13.000 align:start position:0%
then that's I guess one question but if
 
04:48:14.670 --> 04:48:14.680 align:start position:0%
there's an assumption that there will be
 
04:48:16.628 --> 04:48:16.638 align:start position:0%
an increased usage of cannabis in the
 
04:48:18.708 --> 04:48:18.718 align:start position:0%
state and a corresponding increase in
 
04:48:20.470 --> 04:48:20.480 align:start position:0%
impaired driving proportionate to that
 
04:48:22.270 --> 04:48:22.280 align:start position:0%
then I think that that's where it's
 
04:48:24.350 --> 04:48:24.360 align:start position:0%
policy decision in terms of right sizing
 
04:48:26.628 --> 04:48:26.638 align:start position:0%
funding to ensure that the enforcement
 
04:48:30.270 --> 04:48:30.280 align:start position:0%
mechanism for DUI enforcement is Right
 
04:48:32.990 --> 04:48:33.000 align:start position:0%
sized to the amount of of consumption
 
04:48:34.628 --> 04:48:34.638 align:start position:0%
and potential impaired d driving so I
 
04:48:36.708 --> 04:48:36.718 align:start position:0%
think that that's that was my context
 
04:48:40.150 --> 04:48:40.160 align:start position:0%
for um for demands on the state lab and
 
04:48:41.990 --> 04:48:42.000 align:start position:0%
enforcement and that money going to
 
04:48:44.750 --> 04:48:44.760 align:start position:0%
State lab this the extra funding that
 
04:48:46.110 --> 04:48:46.120 align:start position:0%
goes will help could help with
 
04:48:49.270 --> 04:48:49.280 align:start position:0%
prosecution of opioid cases too so part
 
04:48:51.708 --> 04:48:51.718 align:start position:0%
of the problem is that's already I don't
 
04:48:53.150 --> 04:48:53.160 align:start position:0%
know under funding they're underst staff
 
04:48:54.510 --> 04:48:54.520 align:start position:0%
whatever you want to say it's already
 
04:48:57.948 --> 04:48:57.958 align:start position:0%
operating on fumes so giving it in in
 
04:48:59.470 --> 04:48:59.480 align:start position:0%
addition to the burden this could put on
 
04:49:01.708 --> 04:49:01.718 align:start position:0%
them it's still serving a function by
 
04:49:03.590 --> 04:49:03.600 align:start position:0%
helping them if you don't get those
 
04:49:05.150 --> 04:49:05.160 align:start position:0%
results fast enough yet you will get
 
04:49:08.990 --> 04:49:09.000 align:start position:0%
your case thrown out well yeah timely
 
04:49:11.948 --> 04:49:11.958 align:start position:0%
timely you know prosecution yeah cuz
 
04:49:14.270 --> 04:49:14.280 align:start position:0%
we're not California we're take six
 
04:49:17.470 --> 04:49:17.480 align:start position:0%
years to process a jaywalking complaint
 
04:49:17.480 --> 04:49:19.270 align:start position:0%
years to process a jaywalking complaint
um

04:49:19.270 --> 04:49:19.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:49:22.470 --> 04:49:22.480 align:start position:0%
but I'm I'm still of the opinion that uh
 
04:49:24.150 --> 04:49:24.160 align:start position:0%
rather than trying to tie it to this
 
04:49:27.190 --> 04:49:27.200 align:start position:0%
bill you tie it to the overall need
 
04:49:28.830 --> 04:49:28.840 align:start position:0%
because they there definitely is an
 
04:49:30.948 --> 04:49:30.958 align:start position:0%
overall the I'm not
 
04:49:34.788 --> 04:49:34.798 align:start position:0%
against uh funding the lab more uh any
 
04:49:36.270 --> 04:49:36.280 align:start position:0%
more than I am about putting more
 
04:49:37.990 --> 04:49:38.000 align:start position:0%
cruises on the highway because we keep
 
04:49:41.270 --> 04:49:41.280 align:start position:0%
killing people
 
04:49:45.470 --> 04:49:45.480 align:start position:0%
um you know let's let's do it for the
 
04:49:47.590 --> 04:49:47.600 align:start position:0%
right reasons you're on the house Ways
 
04:49:50.628 --> 04:49:50.638 align:start position:0%
and Means Committee uh unfortunately
 
04:49:54.390 --> 04:49:54.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:56.708 --> 04:49:56.718 align:start position:0%
ready we let that this rematch well not
 
04:49:58.750 --> 04:49:58.760 align:start position:0%
only that but there's several others on
 
04:50:00.628 --> 04:50:00.638 align:start position:0%
both sides of the aisle that will come
 
04:50:02.510 --> 04:50:02.520 align:start position:0%
up with a similar
 
04:50:05.110 --> 04:50:05.120 align:start position:0%
discussion be to to justify that but I
 
04:50:06.628 --> 04:50:06.638 align:start position:0%
think for the sake of the bill going
 
04:50:08.510 --> 04:50:08.520 align:start position:0%
forward for the commission I think we
 
04:50:32.830 --> 04:50:32.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:46.030 --> 04:50:46.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:49.030 --> 04:50:49.040 align:start position:0%
page so this is uh this would basically
 
04:50:51.070 --> 04:50:51.080 align:start position:0%
make the existing
 
04:50:53.830 --> 04:50:53.840 align:start position:0%
therapeutic stores assuming they remain
 
04:50:56.070 --> 04:50:56.080 align:start position:0%
just a therapeutic store it would let
 
04:50:58.670 --> 04:50:58.680 align:start position:0%
them be a for-profit entity is that
 
04:51:02.750 --> 04:51:02.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:02.760 --> 04:51:07.390 align:start position:0%
 
does

04:51:07.390 --> 04:51:07.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:07.400 --> 04:51:08.270 align:start position:0%
 
want

04:51:08.270 --> 04:51:08.280 align:start position:0%
want
 
04:51:10.470 --> 04:51:10.480 align:start position:0%
Therapeutics don't we want don't we want
 
04:51:13.510 --> 04:51:13.520 align:start position:0%
the therapeutic programs to fall under
 
04:51:16.230 --> 04:51:16.240 align:start position:0%
uh yeah we do I do well that was that
 
04:51:17.708 --> 04:51:17.718 align:start position:0%
was the conversation we ended with last
 
04:51:19.190 --> 04:51:19.200 align:start position:0%
time I wasn't sure if I missed anything
 
04:51:20.628 --> 04:51:20.638 align:start position:0%
this this morning when I wasn't here so
 
04:51:22.708 --> 04:51:22.718 align:start position:0%
we didn't talk about that oh well how
 
04:51:24.350 --> 04:51:24.360 align:start position:0%
about this that's that was very animated
 
04:51:25.628 --> 04:51:25.638 align:start position:0%
would save that for the end because we
 
04:51:26.788 --> 04:51:26.798 align:start position:0%
just I think we're almost done going
 
04:51:27.788 --> 04:51:27.798 align:start position:0%
through the
 
04:51:31.628 --> 04:51:31.638 align:start position:0%
draft so could we but for the sake of
 
04:51:34.070 --> 04:51:34.080 align:start position:0%
this this was a bill that passed I think
 
04:51:36.948 --> 04:51:36.958 align:start position:0%
we it got vetoed and was sustained by
 
04:51:42.270 --> 04:51:42.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:42.280 --> 04:51:44.390 align:start position:0%
 
term

04:51:44.390 --> 04:51:44.400 align:start position:0%
term
 
04:51:46.628 --> 04:51:46.638 align:start position:0%
but we we'll cover we'll cover that
 
04:51:49.868 --> 04:51:49.878 align:start position:0%
again I'm back okay can you go back for
 
04:51:52.510 --> 04:51:52.520 align:start position:0%
me for one minute just on sure with the
 
04:51:54.590 --> 04:51:54.600 align:start position:0%
shall be vacated in the May so it shall
 
04:51:58.110 --> 04:51:58.120 align:start position:0%
be vacated would be line 19 is that next
 
04:51:59.910 --> 04:51:59.920 align:start position:0%
the 1 May is that going to become a
 
04:52:04.830 --> 04:52:04.840 align:start position:0%
shell take any administrative action
 
04:52:06.750 --> 04:52:06.760 align:start position:0%
is it all becoming shell now for the
 
04:52:08.868 --> 04:52:08.878 align:start position:0%
first two so you have sh be vacated on
 
04:52:12.830 --> 04:52:12.840 align:start position:0%
19 are we changing on 20 to Shell take
 
04:52:12.840 --> 04:52:16.270 align:start position:0%
19 are we changing on 20 to Shell take
judicial

04:52:16.270 --> 04:52:16.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:19.830 --> 04:52:19.840 align:start position:0%
action that's that's I thought you would
 
04:52:22.548 --> 04:52:22.558 align:start position:0%
come up with the two shells so let's say
 
04:52:24.190 --> 04:52:24.200 align:start position:0%
you have the conviction on your record
 
04:52:25.868 --> 04:52:25.878 align:start position:0%
they're saying it's vacated as a matter
 
04:52:28.788 --> 04:52:28.798 align:start position:0%
of law yep so perhaps your background
 
04:52:30.708 --> 04:52:30.718 align:start position:0%
check if someone were to check to see a
 
04:52:33.110 --> 04:52:33.120 align:start position:0%
conviction may still appear on there
 
04:52:34.990 --> 04:52:35.000 align:start position:0%
because the administrative process of
 
04:52:37.830 --> 04:52:37.840 align:start position:0%
vacing hasn't been done yet and that's
 
04:52:39.430 --> 04:52:39.440 align:start position:0%
my point is that this is not going to go
 
04:52:40.990 --> 04:52:41.000 align:start position:0%
back to just people convicted in the
 
04:52:42.990 --> 04:52:43.000 align:start position:0%
last 10 years they can be convicted in
 
04:52:44.548 --> 04:52:44.558 align:start position:0%
you know 50 years ago and they're going
 
04:52:46.910 --> 04:52:46.920 align:start position:0%
to have to go back and so I would leave
 
04:52:50.270 --> 04:52:50.280 align:start position:0%
it at May because you know not that it's
 
04:52:51.548 --> 04:52:51.558 align:start position:0%
even if you think it was an injustice
 
04:52:54.510 --> 04:52:54.520 align:start position:0%
with all due respect going back 70
 
04:52:56.830 --> 04:52:56.840 align:start position:0%
years requiring the court to do that may
 
04:52:59.110 --> 04:52:59.120 align:start position:0%
take some time okay thank you well not
 
04:53:02.190 --> 04:53:02.200 align:start position:0%
only that but as you're aware getting
 
04:53:04.470 --> 04:53:04.480 align:start position:0%
records expunged is
 
04:53:17.788 --> 04:53:17.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:20.868 --> 04:53:20.878 align:start position:0%
Hampshire any issue with number 42 sorry
 
04:53:24.390 --> 04:53:24.400 align:start position:0%
line 42 that's paragraph 18 goes up to
 
04:53:31.350 --> 04:53:31.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:33.910 --> 04:53:33.920 align:start position:0%
page is that language just being change
 
04:53:34.670 --> 04:53:34.680 align:start position:0%
because if you're going to be a
 
04:53:38.190 --> 04:53:38.200 align:start position:0%
for-profit entity the titles of the
 
04:53:46.830 --> 04:53:46.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:49.070 --> 04:53:49.080 align:start position:0%
mind thank you Mr chairman for the
 
04:53:52.190 --> 04:53:52.200 align:start position:0%
record Matt Simon Granite Leaf cannabis
 
04:53:54.788 --> 04:53:54.798 align:start position:0%
I'm not an expert on this section
 
04:53:56.270 --> 04:53:56.280 align:start position:0%
necessarily but I can help you
 
04:53:58.670 --> 04:53:58.680 align:start position:0%
understand where it's coming from so
 
04:54:01.628 --> 04:54:01.638 align:start position:0%
everything beginning on page
 
04:54:06.390 --> 04:54:06.400 align:start position:0%
32 uh line 32 so paragraph 17 paragraph
 
04:54:13.230 --> 04:54:13.240 align:start position:0%
18 19 20 21 22 23 and 24 so all the way
 
04:54:16.590 --> 04:54:16.600 align:start position:0%
to the middle of page 35 uh that is
 
04:54:19.150 --> 04:54:19.160 align:start position:0%
all uh what used to be Standalone
 
04:54:22.708 --> 04:54:22.718 align:start position:0%
legislation in 2019 it was SB 145 and
 
04:54:24.750 --> 04:54:24.760 align:start position:0%
2021 it was
 
04:54:27.990 --> 04:54:28.000 align:start position:0%
sb38 and I believe the only changes have
 
04:54:30.470 --> 04:54:30.480 align:start position:0%
been to the dates but the whole section
 
04:54:32.788 --> 04:54:32.798 align:start position:0%
envisions A for-profit conversion
 
04:54:36.470 --> 04:54:36.480 align:start position:0%
opportunity for the atcs so it's
 
04:54:38.470 --> 04:54:38.480 align:start position:0%
identical language that was the one vote
 
04:54:40.708 --> 04:54:40.718 align:start position:0%
uh I believe so I believe the language
 
04:54:44.350 --> 04:54:44.360 align:start position:0%
is identical thank you sorry for
 
04:54:47.990 --> 04:54:48.000 align:start position:0%
that so section I'm sorry Matt sections
 
04:55:02.390 --> 04:55:02.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:02.400 --> 04:55:14.270 align:start position:0%
 
24

04:55:14.270 --> 04:55:14.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:17.190 --> 04:55:17.200 align:start position:0%
we will now be on line 22 of page 35
 
04:55:32.390 --> 04:55:32.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:36.670 --> 04:55:36.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:39.030 --> 04:55:39.040 align:start position:0%
here can I go back in history with you
 
04:55:40.990 --> 04:55:41.000 align:start position:0%
man for a
 
04:55:44.150 --> 04:55:44.160 align:start position:0%
second just so I remember if I remember
 
04:55:46.030 --> 04:55:46.040 align:start position:0%
correctly six years ago and maybe I
 
04:55:48.270 --> 04:55:48.280 align:start position:0%
brought this up one other time the whole
 
04:55:50.868 --> 04:55:50.878 align:start position:0%
idea behind the dispensaries right we
 
04:55:52.708 --> 04:55:52.718 align:start position:0%
were going to have a medicinal place and
 
04:55:55.070 --> 04:55:55.080 align:start position:0%
you guys were then going to have sort of
 
04:55:56.910 --> 04:55:56.920 align:start position:0%
an advantage since she'd be set up in
 
04:55:59.990 --> 04:56:00.000 align:start position:0%
place you and so we did and you guys I
 
04:56:01.910 --> 04:56:01.920 align:start position:0%
thought had said that you would never
 
04:56:04.030 --> 04:56:04.040 align:start position:0%
want to become a Comm commercial enter
 
04:56:06.110 --> 04:56:06.120 align:start position:0%
you know selling am I remembering this
 
04:56:07.830 --> 04:56:07.840 align:start position:0%
wrong from six years ago I thought you
 
04:56:09.788 --> 04:56:09.798 align:start position:0%
always wanted to stay therapeutic you'd
 
04:56:13.110 --> 04:56:13.120 align:start position:0%
never get into the sale of recreational
 
04:56:14.990 --> 04:56:15.000 align:start position:0%
cannabis and then you guys had said
 
04:56:16.230 --> 04:56:16.240 align:start position:0%
since we're going to have this Advantage
 
04:56:18.030 --> 04:56:18.040 align:start position:0%
we'll never do that am I remembering
 
04:56:19.670 --> 04:56:19.680 align:start position:0%
that wrong Senator I have no
 
04:56:21.190 --> 04:56:21.200 align:start position:0%
recollection of that I'll clarify I've
 
04:56:22.948 --> 04:56:22.958 align:start position:0%
only worked for granite LEF for about
 
04:56:24.788 --> 04:56:24.798 align:start position:0%
two and a half years so six years ago I
 
04:56:26.548 --> 04:56:26.558 align:start position:0%
was in a completely different role but I
 
04:56:28.830 --> 04:56:28.840 align:start position:0%
do not remember anybody saying that I do
 
04:56:31.590 --> 04:56:31.600 align:start position:0%
remember the atc's repeatedly saying
 
04:56:33.548 --> 04:56:33.558 align:start position:0%
that they could serve patients better if
 
04:56:34.750 --> 04:56:34.760 align:start position:0%
they were able to operate on a
 
04:56:45.868 --> 04:56:45.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:50.470 --> 04:56:50.480 align:start position:0%
you all right so back to uh section 25
 
04:56:53.628 --> 04:56:53.638 align:start position:0%
on page 35 section 25 on page 35
 
04:56:56.548 --> 04:56:56.558 align:start position:0%
beginning on line 22 any issue
 
04:57:02.190 --> 04:57:02.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:02.200 --> 04:57:06.628 align:start position:0%
 
straightforward

04:57:06.628 --> 04:57:06.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:09.788 --> 04:57:09.798 align:start position:0%
ask a question um this is to The Liquor
 
04:57:11.708 --> 04:57:11.718 align:start position:0%
Commission do you feel like you all
 
04:57:14.470 --> 04:57:14.480 align:start position:0%
would need a name
 
04:57:17.670 --> 04:57:17.680 align:start position:0%
change liquor and cannabis
 
04:57:19.670 --> 04:57:19.680 align:start position:0%
commission I don't think I don't feel
 
04:57:21.070 --> 04:57:21.080 align:start position:0%
that's necessary still want to be a
 
04:57:23.670 --> 04:57:23.680 align:start position:0%
Liquor Commission I think that would
 
04:57:27.830 --> 04:57:27.840 align:start position:0%
be maybe one day well it's we're not
 
04:57:30.788 --> 04:57:30.798 align:start position:0%
really dealing in the in the retail part
 
04:57:33.750 --> 04:57:33.760 align:start position:0%
of it other than overseeing I see the
 
04:57:36.948 --> 04:57:36.958 align:start position:0%
the franchise piece so it's would be I
 
04:57:40.150 --> 04:57:40.160 align:start position:0%
would consider a two separate
 
04:57:42.868 --> 04:57:42.878 align:start position:0%
entities with the oversight being from
 
04:57:42.878 --> 04:57:44.350 align:start position:0%
entities with the oversight being from
the

04:57:44.350 --> 04:57:44.360 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:57:47.910 --> 04:57:47.920 align:start position:0%
commission also the the so the New
 
04:57:49.788 --> 04:57:49.798 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Li have a great did a great
 
04:57:53.350 --> 04:57:53.360 align:start position:0%
job with their branding identity and
 
04:57:55.910 --> 04:57:55.920 align:start position:0%
um just similar to our oversight of
 
04:58:02.110 --> 04:58:02.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:02.120 --> 04:58:04.510 align:start position:0%
 
you

04:58:04.510 --> 04:58:04.520 align:start position:0%
you
 
04:58:04.520 --> 04:58:07.270 align:start position:0%
you
yeah

04:58:07.270 --> 04:58:07.280 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
04:58:10.548 --> 04:58:10.558 align:start position:0%
yes uh paragraph three under paragraph
 
04:58:13.548 --> 04:58:13.558 align:start position:0%
25 that would be line
 
04:58:24.750 --> 04:58:24.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:24.760 --> 04:58:30.190 align:start position:0%
 
warrant

04:58:30.190 --> 04:58:30.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:34.750 --> 04:58:34.760 align:start position:0%
so if I can I can speak that quickly uh
 
04:58:37.110 --> 04:58:37.120 align:start position:0%
that language just mirrors the language
 
04:58:39.390 --> 04:58:39.400 align:start position:0%
that's in the liquor statute that the
 
04:58:41.070 --> 04:58:41.080 align:start position:0%
liquor commissioner or the Deputy
 
04:58:42.830 --> 04:58:42.840 align:start position:0%
Commissioner can go into any
 
04:58:45.548 --> 04:58:45.558 align:start position:0%
establishment at any time and speak it's
 
04:58:47.708 --> 04:58:47.718 align:start position:0%
it's mainly to speak with the owner
 
04:58:49.548 --> 04:58:49.558 align:start position:0%
their business partners we go in and
 
04:58:51.910 --> 04:58:51.920 align:start position:0%
speak with them about their business
 
04:58:55.150 --> 04:58:55.160 align:start position:0%
it's not a search and seizure type of
 
04:58:57.708 --> 04:58:57.718 align:start position:0%
operation it's more of a
 
04:59:00.990 --> 04:59:01.000 align:start position:0%
partnership question question and answer
 
04:59:02.430 --> 04:59:02.440 align:start position:0%
anything we can help you with are we
 
04:59:04.628 --> 04:59:04.638 align:start position:0%
doing the right things or how are we
 
04:59:07.310 --> 04:59:07.320 align:start position:0%
doing as a business how else can we help
 
04:59:09.868 --> 04:59:09.878 align:start position:0%
you uh thank you for putting that on the
 
04:59:13.708 --> 04:59:13.718 align:start position:0%
record um as you the senator is well
 
04:59:15.150 --> 04:59:15.160 align:start position:0%
aware there's a certain group of
 
04:59:19.350 --> 04:59:19.360 align:start position:0%
individuals that will spot that and uh
 
04:59:20.830 --> 04:59:20.840 align:start position:0%
so it's not a fourth amendment issue
 
04:59:23.350 --> 04:59:23.360 align:start position:0%
because by simply by getting the license
 
04:59:26.150 --> 04:59:26.160 align:start position:0%
you are agreeing to this search I just I
 
04:59:27.750 --> 04:59:27.760 align:start position:0%
that's fine I want put that on the
 
04:59:29.868 --> 04:59:29.878 align:start position:0%
record C when they see it remind them
 
04:59:32.030 --> 04:59:32.040 align:start position:0%
that if you don't want to be searched at
 
04:59:34.548 --> 04:59:34.558 align:start position:0%
random don't ask for a license or permit
 
04:59:37.430 --> 04:59:37.440 align:start position:0%
to sell or manufacture cannabis thank
 
04:59:40.470 --> 04:59:40.480 align:start position:0%
you for putting that up that description
 
04:59:43.548 --> 04:59:43.558 align:start position:0%
forward uh now we have it where it
 
04:59:48.310 --> 04:59:48.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:52.110 --> 04:59:52.120 align:start position:0%
sir in on page 35 beginning line 41
 
04:59:54.470 --> 04:59:54.480 align:start position:0%
that's under par section 26 ran numeral
 
04:59:57.708 --> 04:59:57.718 align:start position:0%
2 that's just the opportunity for to
 
05:00:01.190 --> 05:00:01.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:21.190 --> 05:00:21.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:23.830 --> 05:00:23.840 align:start position:0%
chairman I obviously you want to have a
 
05:00:27.190 --> 05:00:27.200 align:start position:0%
prosecutor perhaps that is custom with
 
05:00:28.750 --> 05:00:28.760 align:start position:0%
Prosecuting these types of cases that
 
05:00:30.910 --> 05:00:30.920 align:start position:0%
makes sense that's pretty common that's
 
05:00:30.920 --> 05:00:31.910 align:start position:0%
makes sense that's pretty common that's
section

05:00:31.910 --> 05:00:31.920 align:start position:0%
section
 
05:00:31.920 --> 05:00:39.190 align:start position:0%
section
27

05:00:39.190 --> 05:00:39.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:41.190 --> 05:00:41.200 align:start position:0%
I'm skipping down to I'm sorry I have to
 
05:00:43.510 --> 05:00:43.520 align:start position:0%
leave um but I'm skipping down briefly
 
05:00:46.590 --> 05:00:46.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:46.600 --> 05:00:50.670 align:start position:0%
 
29

05:00:50.670 --> 05:00:50.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:54.030 --> 05:00:54.040 align:start position:0%
yes we this is a retail
 
05:00:55.910 --> 05:00:55.920 align:start position:0%
tobacco an
 
05:00:58.910 --> 05:00:58.920 align:start position:0%
existing tobacco retailer now is allowed
 
05:01:01.590 --> 05:01:01.600 align:start position:0%
to sell
 
05:01:03.670 --> 05:01:03.680 align:start position:0%
so but they would still have to get a
 
05:01:07.030 --> 05:01:07.040 align:start position:0%
separate franchise right that has to do
 
05:01:09.150 --> 05:01:09.160 align:start position:0%
with the licenses I mean sorry that the
 
05:01:11.470 --> 05:01:11.480 align:start position:0%
um that has to do with
 
05:01:13.990 --> 05:01:14.000 align:start position:0%
paraphernalia oh got it and the reason
 
05:01:15.548 --> 05:01:15.558 align:start position:0%
is is that you know cannabis
 
05:01:17.708 --> 05:01:17.718 align:start position:0%
paraphernalia and tobacco paraphernalia
 
05:01:19.430 --> 05:01:19.440 align:start position:0%
are very hard to distinguish from each
 
05:01:21.628 --> 05:01:21.638 align:start position:0%
other I mean they're actually basically
 
05:01:24.070 --> 05:01:24.080 align:start position:0%
the same thing for the most
 
05:01:28.868 --> 05:01:28.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:32.230 --> 05:01:32.240 align:start position:0%
right well that's why that's how they
 
05:01:37.310 --> 05:01:37.320 align:start position:0%
get around now I see I just yeah I
 
05:01:39.590 --> 05:01:39.600 align:start position:0%
see I apologize Mr chair I have to go
 
05:01:40.670 --> 05:01:40.680 align:start position:0%
get my son at
 
05:01:44.110 --> 05:01:44.120 align:start position:0%
school me first well we were GNA have
 
05:01:45.670 --> 05:01:45.680 align:start position:0%
that animated discussion that we left
 
05:01:48.270 --> 05:01:48.280 align:start position:0%
off with last hearing but um if you want
 
05:01:51.910 --> 05:01:51.920 align:start position:0%
to listen from afar and I'm sure um I'm
 
05:01:53.150 --> 05:01:53.160 align:start position:0%
not sure I want my 10-year-old to listen
 
05:01:55.910 --> 05:01:55.920 align:start position:0%
to that conversation Mr chair the I'm
 
05:01:58.470 --> 05:01:58.480 align:start position:0%
sure the senator from District 23 will
 
05:02:01.750 --> 05:02:01.760 align:start position:0%
uh read it present any messages on your
 
05:02:03.868 --> 05:02:03.878 align:start position:0%
behalf perhaps would you want to hold it
 
05:02:06.310 --> 05:02:06.320 align:start position:0%
until Senator Lang and I are back we we
 
05:02:07.708 --> 05:02:07.718 align:start position:0%
can but we're not going to make a final
 
05:02:10.948 --> 05:02:10.958 align:start position:0%
decision for the anyone so um but next
 
05:02:12.628 --> 05:02:12.638 align:start position:0%
meeting I want to say he going to be our
 
05:02:17.350 --> 05:02:17.360 align:start position:0%
we got to have some consensus done so um
 
05:02:20.548 --> 05:02:20.558 align:start position:0%
but we'll just finish for the I think we
 
05:02:26.270 --> 05:02:26.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:28.708 --> 05:02:28.718 align:start position:0%
so I would hope we get the effective
 
05:02:31.670 --> 05:02:31.680 align:start position:0%
date right after all the work we put in
 
05:02:45.350 --> 05:02:45.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:48.270 --> 05:02:48.280 align:start position:0%
the money for the uh public the $500,000
 
05:02:50.948 --> 05:02:50.958 align:start position:0%
that's just in there twice so page 37
 
05:02:53.830 --> 05:02:53.840 align:start position:0%
lines 1 to three on Roman
 
05:03:01.670 --> 05:03:01.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:01.680 --> 05:03:08.310 align:start position:0%
 
27

05:03:08.310 --> 05:03:08.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:08.320 --> 05:03:11.910 align:start position:0%
 
okay

05:03:11.910 --> 05:03:11.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:15.670 --> 05:03:15.680 align:start position:0%
so I would probably want to just strike
 
05:03:17.708 --> 05:03:17.718 align:start position:0%
lines one through three on page 37 does
 
05:03:20.150 --> 05:03:20.160 align:start position:0%
that make sense there new new Futures
 
05:03:22.788 --> 05:03:22.798 align:start position:0%
here I don't want to get mad at
 
05:03:25.070 --> 05:03:25.080 align:start position:0%
me Senator Whitley just left and then we
 
05:03:25.080 --> 05:03:26.030 align:start position:0%
me Senator Whitley just left and then we
strike

05:03:26.030 --> 05:03:26.040 align:start position:0%
strike
 
05:03:28.470 --> 05:03:28.480 align:start position:0%
there provision but that's the same are
 
05:03:31.670 --> 05:03:31.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:31.680 --> 05:03:41.708 align:start position:0%
 
that

05:03:41.708 --> 05:03:41.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:41.718 --> 05:03:44.190 align:start position:0%
 
okay

05:03:44.190 --> 05:03:44.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:55.750 --> 05:03:55.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:59.190 --> 05:03:59.200 align:start position:0%
longoi so which one are we striking then
 
05:04:01.190 --> 05:04:01.200 align:start position:0%
we would strike paragraph three and
 
05:04:04.910 --> 05:04:04.920 align:start position:0%
paragraph four removing them on page 27
 
05:04:08.868 --> 05:04:08.878 align:start position:0%
on page 27 okay removing them
 
05:04:11.470 --> 05:04:11.480 align:start position:0%
to section
 
05:04:11.480 --> 05:04:12.990 align:start position:0%
to section
31

05:04:12.990 --> 05:04:13.000 align:start position:0%
31
 
05:04:13.000 --> 05:04:16.910 align:start position:0%
31
paragraphs

05:04:16.910 --> 05:04:16.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:21.590 --> 05:04:21.600 align:start position:0%
pars so just to clarify lines 21 through
 
05:04:25.030 --> 05:04:25.040 align:start position:0%
28 on page 27 are being stricken and the
 
05:04:31.548 --> 05:04:31.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:33.628 --> 05:04:33.638 align:start position:0%
appropriation different years though we
 
05:04:36.708 --> 05:04:36.718 align:start position:0%
all agree on that just wanted to it is
 
05:04:40.270 --> 05:04:40.280 align:start position:0%
two different years recognize it is June
 
05:04:43.708 --> 05:04:43.718 align:start position:0%
of 24 and then June of
 
05:04:50.310 --> 05:04:50.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:54.868 --> 05:04:54.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:58.310 --> 05:04:58.320 align:start position:0%
million I I think that line 40 is a typo
 
05:05:01.868 --> 05:05:01.878 align:start position:0%
because all the other dates are 2025 in
 
05:05:03.390 --> 05:05:03.400 align:start position:0%
this section so I think that's just a
 
05:05:05.230 --> 05:05:05.240 align:start position:0%
typo well when we come back when we make
 
05:05:07.390 --> 05:05:07.400 align:start position:0%
the revisions make sure that we're not
 
05:05:10.070 --> 05:05:10.080 align:start position:0%
okay we'll leave it for now but with the
 
05:05:11.910 --> 05:05:11.920 align:start position:0%
understanding for next time there is a
 
05:05:17.750 --> 05:05:17.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:21.230 --> 05:05:21.240 align:start position:0%
be earlier you don't put Appropriations
 
05:05:23.628 --> 05:05:23.638 align:start position:0%
when you're establishing fund you
 
05:05:29.548 --> 05:05:29.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:29.558 --> 05:05:31.470 align:start position:0%
 
section

05:05:31.470 --> 05:05:31.480 align:start position:0%
section
 
05:05:31.480 --> 05:05:33.310 align:start position:0%
section
EST

05:05:33.310 --> 05:05:33.320 align:start position:0%
EST
 
05:05:38.030 --> 05:05:38.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:38.040 --> 05:05:43.430 align:start position:0%
 
that

05:05:43.430 --> 05:05:43.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:46.030 --> 05:05:46.040 align:start position:0%
okay Senator I'll check the numbers just
 
05:05:47.510 --> 05:05:47.520 align:start position:0%
to make sure that the numbers are
 
05:05:55.670 --> 05:05:55.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:59.030 --> 05:05:59.040 align:start position:0%
the all right just clarify that but all
 
05:05:59.040 --> 05:06:01.390 align:start position:0%
the all right just clarify that but all
right

05:06:01.390 --> 05:06:01.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:01.400 --> 05:06:10.990 align:start position:0%
 
so

05:06:10.990 --> 05:06:11.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:13.948 --> 05:06:13.958 align:start position:0%
is that a title I think so if you look
 
05:06:15.990 --> 05:06:16.000 align:start position:0%
at line 40 on page
 
05:06:19.230 --> 05:06:19.240 align:start position:0%
36 the date is June 30th
 
05:06:23.030 --> 05:06:23.040 align:start position:0%
2024 all the other dates are June 30th
 
05:06:25.190 --> 05:06:25.200 align:start position:0%
2025 so I think that that might just be
 
05:06:25.200 --> 05:06:31.390 align:start position:0%
2025 so I think that that might just be
a

05:06:31.390 --> 05:06:31.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:31.400 --> 05:06:35.110 align:start position:0%
 
typo

05:06:35.110 --> 05:06:35.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:40.788 --> 05:06:40.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:43.350 --> 05:06:43.360 align:start position:0%
immediately well we'll double I I we'll
 
05:06:44.990 --> 05:06:45.000 align:start position:0%
double check that but I think you I I
 
05:06:48.628 --> 05:06:48.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:52.670 --> 05:06:52.680 align:start position:0%
saying could I'll just state that Mr
 
05:06:55.110 --> 05:06:55.120 align:start position:0%
chair that well that work will start
 
05:06:58.270 --> 05:06:58.280 align:start position:0%
immediately upon passage of the bill so
 
05:07:01.150 --> 05:07:01.160 align:start position:0%
I I'm not going to argue to the dates
 
05:07:04.430 --> 05:07:04.440 align:start position:0%
but there there'll be need for funding
 
05:07:07.070 --> 05:07:07.080 align:start position:0%
to get to get that work started let's
 
05:07:10.430 --> 05:07:10.440 align:start position:0%
just say that's all let's just say this
 
05:07:13.230 --> 05:07:13.240 align:start position:0%
bill whatever bills whatever it becomes
 
05:07:15.628 --> 05:07:15.638 align:start position:0%
law signed into
 
05:07:20.750 --> 05:07:20.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:23.788 --> 05:07:23.798 align:start position:0%
1 they won't have any money to get
 
05:07:26.708 --> 05:07:26.718 align:start position:0%
started that's correct so I I feel it's
 
05:07:29.190 --> 05:07:29.200 align:start position:0%
9 million now someone may may say that's
 
05:07:31.990 --> 05:07:32.000 align:start position:0%
too high but I think the idea is all
 
05:07:34.030 --> 05:07:34.040 align:start position:0%
right we got to get started if we
 
05:07:34.040 --> 05:07:36.190 align:start position:0%
right we got to get started if we
wait

05:07:36.190 --> 05:07:36.200 align:start position:0%
wait
 
05:07:38.868 --> 05:07:38.878 align:start position:0%
well they're not going to have I mean
 
05:07:40.628 --> 05:07:40.638 align:start position:0%
that's one way to stop government
 
05:07:42.750 --> 05:07:42.760 align:start position:0%
actions by not funding it don't you
 
05:07:47.350 --> 05:07:47.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:50.670 --> 05:07:50.680 align:start position:0%
20th maybe I don't I'm I'm just pointing
 
05:07:53.270 --> 05:07:53.280 align:start position:0%
out that I think what the commission
 
05:07:56.030 --> 05:07:56.040 align:start position:0%
what he commissioner saying is he needs
 
05:07:57.510 --> 05:07:57.520 align:start position:0%
that they without money to do it they're
 
05:07:59.310 --> 05:07:59.320 align:start position:0%
going to be just sitting there waiting
 
05:08:01.310 --> 05:08:01.320 align:start position:0%
and that hurts everyone that I mean we
 
05:08:03.110 --> 05:08:03.120 align:start position:0%
saw that happen with some of the atcs
 
05:08:04.990 --> 05:08:05.000 align:start position:0%
some of their administrative rules takes
 
05:08:07.350 --> 05:08:07.360 align:start position:0%
two years to get what was it a lot
 
05:08:09.110 --> 05:08:09.120 align:start position:0%
except the out ofate uh therapeutic
 
05:08:13.628 --> 05:08:13.638 align:start position:0%
cards how long that take one year two
 
05:08:16.948 --> 05:08:16.958 align:start position:0%
years one and a half a long time way too
 
05:08:19.230 --> 05:08:19.240 align:start position:0%
long that's that's the answer right so
 
05:08:20.910 --> 05:08:20.920 align:start position:0%
we don't we don't want them sitting
 
05:08:20.920 --> 05:08:22.708 align:start position:0%
we don't we don't want them sitting
around

05:08:22.708 --> 05:08:22.718 align:start position:0%
around
 
05:08:24.868 --> 05:08:24.878 align:start position:0%
because there will be a lot of moving
 
05:08:28.390 --> 05:08:28.400 align:start position:0%
parts so I think we got to be careful
 
05:08:30.150 --> 05:08:30.160 align:start position:0%
with we're not going to just throw money
 
05:08:32.910 --> 05:08:32.920 align:start position:0%
at it but we don't want to also I guess
 
05:08:35.990 --> 05:08:36.000 align:start position:0%
handcuff the project or set up a failure
 
05:08:36.990 --> 05:08:37.000 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm wondering if it'd be
 
05:08:39.430 --> 05:08:39.440 align:start position:0%
appropriate I understanding I don't
 
05:08:40.510 --> 05:08:40.520 align:start position:0%
understand the exact amount they'll need
 
05:08:43.030 --> 05:08:43.040 align:start position:0%
to get this process started but having
 
05:08:45.030 --> 05:08:45.040 align:start position:0%
it impact or having it go into effect
 
05:08:47.110 --> 05:08:47.120 align:start position:0%
upon passage because the 30mon clock
 
05:08:49.708 --> 05:08:49.718 align:start position:0%
from the rule making all that starts
 
05:08:52.628 --> 05:08:52.638 align:start position:0%
right when this passes and so yeah
 
05:08:54.310 --> 05:08:54.320 align:start position:0%
making sure that they have the funds
 
05:08:56.150 --> 05:08:56.160 align:start position:0%
right away to get started because the
 
05:08:57.670 --> 05:08:57.680 align:start position:0%
clock is taking right off the bat for
 
05:09:01.110 --> 05:09:01.120 align:start position:0%
them correct that's what I'm
 
05:09:01.120 --> 05:09:04.270 align:start position:0%
them correct that's what I'm
saying

05:09:04.270 --> 05:09:04.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:05.788 --> 05:09:05.798 align:start position:0%
all right
 
05:09:08.670 --> 05:09:08.680 align:start position:0%
so I think was there anything animated
 
05:09:11.070 --> 05:09:11.080 align:start position:0%
that we need to discuss I know there was
 
05:09:12.270 --> 05:09:12.280 align:start position:0%
issues with the possession I think we
 
05:09:13.868 --> 05:09:13.878 align:start position:0%
should wait for Senator Lang and Senator
 
05:09:17.910 --> 05:09:17.920 align:start position:0%
Whitley to be here for that um did I was
 
05:09:21.230 --> 05:09:21.240 align:start position:0%
late so I apologize but did we discuss I
 
05:09:23.510 --> 05:09:23.520 align:start position:0%
know Dr younger's not here but did she
 
05:09:28.110 --> 05:09:28.120 align:start position:0%
have any info on that n
 
05:09:30.230 --> 05:09:30.240 align:start position:0%
nanograms I mean others will probably
 
05:09:32.110 --> 05:09:32.120 align:start position:0%
correct me if I'm misspeaking here but
 
05:09:33.868 --> 05:09:33.878 align:start position:0%
she basically said that there's no
 
05:09:35.990 --> 05:09:36.000 align:start position:0%
scientific number there's no magic
 
05:09:39.230 --> 05:09:39.240 align:start position:0%
number for what that what so what
 
05:09:41.628 --> 05:09:41.638 align:start position:0%
intoxication is no I know not
 
05:09:43.990 --> 05:09:44.000 align:start position:0%
intoxication but it's a per se limit I
 
05:09:45.628 --> 05:09:45.638 align:start position:0%
think was we talked about some states
 
05:09:46.990 --> 05:09:47.000 align:start position:0%
that do have yeah some states have it
 
05:09:48.310 --> 05:09:48.320 align:start position:0%
but that there's no there's no
 
05:09:50.310 --> 05:09:50.320 align:start position:0%
scientific backing for having a per se
 
05:09:52.270 --> 05:09:52.280 align:start position:0%
limit without getting to the details of
 
05:09:56.948 --> 05:09:56.958 align:start position:0%
my body composition I'm 215 pounds how
 
05:09:59.670 --> 05:09:59.680 align:start position:0%
many grams of Edibles would a 2115 pound
 
05:10:02.190 --> 05:10:02.200 align:start position:0%
person have to be at like five DS that's
 
05:10:03.670 --> 05:10:03.680 align:start position:0%
what I was trying to get it one of the
 
05:10:05.470 --> 05:10:05.480 align:start position:0%
things she was talking about was that it
 
05:10:07.350 --> 05:10:07.360 align:start position:0%
really depends on how much you use so
 
05:10:09.030 --> 05:10:09.040 align:start position:0%
someone who's I like I don't use
 
05:10:10.948 --> 05:10:10.958 align:start position:0%
marijuana so the first time I took an
 
05:10:13.628 --> 05:10:13.638 align:start position:0%
edible I'd have high levels but if
 
05:10:15.948 --> 05:10:15.958 align:start position:0%
someone was a chronic user they take the
 
05:10:17.830 --> 05:10:17.840 align:start position:0%
same amount as me weigh the same as me
 
05:10:19.868 --> 05:10:19.878 align:start position:0%
have a much no it's going to vary from
 
05:10:22.190 --> 05:10:22.200 align:start position:0%
person to person I'm just saying my my
 
05:10:25.150 --> 05:10:25.160 align:start position:0%
only problem is I'm just as a the legal
 
05:10:27.110 --> 05:10:27.120 align:start position:0%
mind of me saying if I want to advise
 
05:10:28.548 --> 05:10:28.558 align:start position:0%
someone how to comply with the law how
 
05:10:30.990 --> 05:10:31.000 align:start position:0%
do I do it well it's not I'm not saying
 
05:10:32.110 --> 05:10:32.120 align:start position:0%
that they're impaired because they're
 
05:10:34.590 --> 05:10:34.600 align:start position:0%
nanograms are at five but how do how
 
05:10:36.628 --> 05:10:36.638 align:start position:0%
does someone know well if I use this
 
05:10:39.990 --> 05:10:40.000 align:start position:0%
much I'm going to pass I we well no does
 
05:10:41.990 --> 05:10:42.000 align:start position:0%
anyone there's nothing on that at all
 
05:10:43.470 --> 05:10:43.480 align:start position:0%
well we we we just had this state
 
05:10:45.510 --> 05:10:45.520 align:start position:0%
trooper you know get get killed over on
 
05:10:48.310 --> 05:10:48.320 align:start position:0%
the Sea Coast or whatever and is as you
 
05:10:50.910 --> 05:10:50.920 align:start position:0%
all read that the gentleman pleed guilty
 
05:10:54.270 --> 05:10:54.280 align:start position:0%
when THC was found in his his blood and
 
05:10:56.150 --> 05:10:56.160 align:start position:0%
we have a we have a dead guy right a
 
05:11:00.150 --> 05:11:00.160 align:start position:0%
dead sea Trooper all right I I I'm not
 
05:11:02.830 --> 05:11:02.840 align:start position:0%
saying that that person wasn't inair
 
05:11:05.110 --> 05:11:05.120 align:start position:0%
but if you have a per se limit you need
 
05:11:06.868 --> 05:11:06.878 align:start position:0%
to know how much you got to take to
 
05:11:08.350 --> 05:11:08.360 align:start position:0%
reach that limit at
 
05:11:10.628 --> 05:11:10.638 align:start position:0%
least yeah I think that was the concern
 
05:11:12.590 --> 05:11:12.600 align:start position:0%
was not to have a per se limit and to
 
05:11:14.948 --> 05:11:14.958 align:start position:0%
have as like I have a whole host of
 
05:11:16.430 --> 05:11:16.440 align:start position:0%
things that are available so that like
 
05:11:20.150 --> 05:11:20.160 align:start position:0%
Dr test like David have the the universe
 
05:11:24.590 --> 05:11:24.600 align:start position:0%
there Chief and Mr chair it's not the
 
05:11:29.470 --> 05:11:29.480 align:start position:0%
level it's the behavior yes and that's
 
05:11:32.270 --> 05:11:32.280 align:start position:0%
the behavior can be whether you're
 
05:11:34.390 --> 05:11:34.400 align:start position:0%
alcoholic um if you're a chronic
 
05:11:37.470 --> 05:11:37.480 align:start position:0%
alcoholic you can operate pretty well at
 
05:11:40.788 --> 05:11:40.798 align:start position:0%
0.12 but you're you're violating the law
 
05:11:45.110 --> 05:11:45.120 align:start position:0%
on a on a PR Prima fascia basis but
 
05:11:47.030 --> 05:11:47.040 align:start position:0%
you're still driving in a straight line
 
05:11:50.750 --> 05:11:50.760 align:start position:0%
and stopping in plenty of time whereas
 
05:11:52.948 --> 05:11:52.958 align:start position:0%
uh a
 
05:11:55.070 --> 05:11:55.080 align:start position:0%
17-year-old at
 
05:11:58.310 --> 05:11:58.320 align:start position:0%
02 going to have a little bit of
 
05:12:01.868 --> 05:12:01.878 align:start position:0%
difficulty uh so it's it's the behav
 
05:12:03.910 --> 05:12:03.920 align:start position:0%
Behavior not the level and I don't think
 
05:12:05.948 --> 05:12:05.958 align:start position:0%
we should get caught up in a level
 
05:12:08.750 --> 05:12:08.760 align:start position:0%
because even though we have one for
 
05:12:14.510 --> 05:12:14.520 align:start position:0%
alcohol we there isn't one for uh um Mar
 
05:12:17.510 --> 05:12:17.520 align:start position:0%
or cannabis there isn't one for Valium
 
05:12:22.470 --> 05:12:22.480 align:start position:0%
there isn't one for uh um the lotted and
 
05:12:23.990 --> 05:12:24.000 align:start position:0%
those are prescription drugs that people
 
05:12:26.750 --> 05:12:26.760 align:start position:0%
drive with day in and day out no I I
 
05:12:29.708 --> 05:12:29.718 align:start position:0%
understand Chief my I'm I agree with you
 
05:12:31.230 --> 05:12:31.240 align:start position:0%
to the extent that I can't figure out
 
05:12:32.590 --> 05:12:32.600 align:start position:0%
how to advise some some to comply with
 
05:12:34.590 --> 05:12:34.600 align:start position:0%
the law if we can get to the point where
 
05:12:37.948 --> 05:12:37.958 align:start position:0%
we can provide some ballpark realm where
 
05:12:40.430 --> 05:12:40.440 align:start position:0%
we can tell someone if you're using this
 
05:12:43.270 --> 05:12:43.280 align:start position:0%
amount you may strug otherwise I mean
 
05:12:44.670 --> 05:12:44.680 align:start position:0%
it's I don't think
 
05:12:48.788 --> 05:12:48.798 align:start position:0%
it's well if I may uh for the benefit of
 
05:12:50.990 --> 05:12:51.000 align:start position:0%
the discussion that we had earlier is
 
05:12:52.788 --> 05:12:52.798 align:start position:0%
the difference between per se limit and
 
05:12:56.670 --> 05:12:56.680 align:start position:0%
and a primma fascia case uh the per se
 
05:12:59.310 --> 05:12:59.320 align:start position:0%
limit like we used to alcohol breath
 
05:13:03.150 --> 05:13:03.160 align:start position:0%
test is a Hardline limit uh the the
 
05:13:05.150 --> 05:13:05.160 align:start position:0%
expectation is is that if you hit
 
05:13:08.470 --> 05:13:08.480 align:start position:0%
0.08 um that the presumption is is that
 
05:13:10.470 --> 05:13:10.480 align:start position:0%
you're impaired okay with marijuana
 
05:13:12.230 --> 05:13:12.240 align:start position:0%
there is no scientific limit right as
 
05:13:15.270 --> 05:13:15.280 align:start position:0%
you rightly indicated uh and the science
 
05:13:18.510 --> 05:13:18.520 align:start position:0%
is still uh widely variant with respect
 
05:13:24.270 --> 05:13:24.280 align:start position:0%
to um impairment uh by various levels of
 
05:13:24.280 --> 05:13:25.548 align:start position:0%
to um impairment uh by various levels of
THC

05:13:25.548 --> 05:13:25.558 align:start position:0%
THC
 
05:13:29.190 --> 05:13:29.200 align:start position:0%
content the states that have walked the
 
05:13:32.590 --> 05:13:32.600 align:start position:0%
narrow path between the two
 
05:13:34.470 --> 05:13:34.480 align:start position:0%
have looked at
 
05:13:37.350 --> 05:13:37.360 align:start position:0%
Alternatives such as a primma fashion
 
05:13:41.750 --> 05:13:41.760 align:start position:0%
limit which is only an additional limit
 
05:13:44.670 --> 05:13:44.680 align:start position:0%
or additional element excuse me that
 
05:13:47.190 --> 05:13:47.200 align:start position:0%
would be included along with the other
 
05:13:51.548 --> 05:13:51.558 align:start position:0%
observable evidence developed in a DUI
 
05:13:55.590 --> 05:13:55.600 align:start position:0%
case such as the officer's observations
 
05:13:58.868 --> 05:13:58.878 align:start position:0%
uh the officer's uh information evidence
 
05:14:00.910 --> 05:14:00.920 align:start position:0%
that may be obtained similar to open
 
05:14:03.230 --> 05:14:03.240 align:start position:0%
containers let me so just to rephrase
 
05:14:06.150 --> 05:14:06.160 align:start position:0%
this so if let's say the number was five
 
05:14:09.708 --> 05:14:09.718 align:start position:0%
nanograms and if you tested positive for
 
05:14:11.868 --> 05:14:11.878 align:start position:0%
five nagr or six so you're over that
 
05:14:14.390 --> 05:14:14.400 align:start position:0%
limit that's only evidence of impairment
 
05:14:16.150 --> 05:14:16.160 align:start position:0%
where as opposed to alcohol it you know
 
05:14:18.150 --> 05:14:18.160 align:start position:0%
8 or higher you are impairment that that
 
05:14:20.230 --> 05:14:20.240 align:start position:0%
would be correct it would be essentially
 
05:14:22.390 --> 05:14:22.400 align:start position:0%
in your legal terminology a rebut it
 
05:14:24.270 --> 05:14:24.280 align:start position:0%
would create a rebuttable
 
05:14:26.310 --> 05:14:26.320 align:start position:0%
presumption uh that would shift the
 
05:14:28.230 --> 05:14:28.240 align:start position:0%
burden from the state back to the
 
05:14:31.230 --> 05:14:31.240 align:start position:0%
operator um for the judge to consider it
 
05:14:34.548 --> 05:14:34.558 align:start position:0%
would not not be uh the overarching
 
05:14:38.628 --> 05:14:38.638 align:start position:0%
requirement for for for intoxication is
 
05:14:42.470 --> 05:14:42.480 align:start position:0%
that how your office interpreted that in
 
05:14:46.430 --> 05:14:46.440 align:start position:0%
terms of the the testimony today and and
 
05:14:50.350 --> 05:14:50.360 align:start position:0%
uh whether a limit would be workable as
 
05:14:52.990 --> 05:14:53.000 align:start position:0%
as evidence of impairment as opposed to
 
05:14:55.628 --> 05:14:55.638 align:start position:0%
conclusive per se limit yes that would
 
05:14:57.270 --> 05:14:57.280 align:start position:0%
be consistent with how other states
 
05:15:00.868 --> 05:15:00.878 align:start position:0%
operate um in in terms of prosecutions
 
05:15:02.430 --> 05:15:02.440 align:start position:0%
whether it
 
05:15:03.830 --> 05:15:03.840 align:start position:0%
I guess the allocation of the bur that's
 
05:15:06.750 --> 05:15:06.760 align:start position:0%
yeah my mistake was I was I was I was
 
05:15:11.110 --> 05:15:11.120 align:start position:0%
thinking per per se so I I think uh just
 
05:15:12.948 --> 05:15:12.958 align:start position:0%
one flag if we were to make this even
 
05:15:14.868 --> 05:15:14.878 align:start position:0%
like a rebuttable presumption is that
 
05:15:16.548 --> 05:15:16.558 align:start position:0%
rebuttable presumption would be based on
 
05:15:18.150 --> 05:15:18.160 align:start position:0%
something that's not scientifically
 
05:15:21.230 --> 05:15:21.240 align:start position:0%
valid um because there is no consensus
 
05:15:22.750 --> 05:15:22.760 align:start position:0%
on that issue and so if we were to make
 
05:15:24.868 --> 05:15:24.878 align:start position:0%
up a number five or 10 or whatever that
 
05:15:27.110 --> 05:15:27.120 align:start position:0%
is it still be making a number out of
 
05:15:28.670 --> 05:15:28.680 align:start position:0%
thin air because there's no science
 
05:15:30.868 --> 05:15:30.878 align:start position:0%
behind that number and so the create a
 
05:15:32.510 --> 05:15:32.520 align:start position:0%
reable presump assumtion to put a burden
 
05:15:34.470 --> 05:15:34.480 align:start position:0%
on someone to have to prove a negative
 
05:15:36.990 --> 05:15:37.000 align:start position:0%
in that case would be problematic and so
 
05:15:38.310 --> 05:15:38.320 align:start position:0%
I think that's why it's really important
 
05:15:39.590 --> 05:15:39.600 align:start position:0%
that we look at this like we do with
 
05:15:42.470 --> 05:15:42.480 align:start position:0%
opioids or other prescription drugs that
 
05:15:44.310 --> 05:15:44.320 align:start position:0%
you know there's a totality of things
 
05:15:46.030 --> 05:15:46.040 align:start position:0%
that happened in that that the officer
 
05:15:49.590 --> 05:15:49.600 align:start position:0%
can document and then testify about and
 
05:15:51.430 --> 05:15:51.440 align:start position:0%
then it's and then I think it's really
 
05:15:53.030 --> 05:15:53.040 align:start position:0%
important that in the funding stream
 
05:15:55.628 --> 05:15:55.638 align:start position:0%
that we are funding the Dr programs and
 
05:15:57.390 --> 05:15:57.400 align:start position:0%
giving State Police and others the
 
05:15:59.590 --> 05:15:59.600 align:start position:0%
resources they'll need to be able to
 
05:16:01.750 --> 05:16:01.760 align:start position:0%
have folks available to do that no in
 
05:16:03.310 --> 05:16:03.320 align:start position:0%
color I I I appreciate what you're
 
05:16:04.948 --> 05:16:04.958 align:start position:0%
saying how do you rebut a presumption if
 
05:16:06.910 --> 05:16:06.920 align:start position:0%
the science isn't there to do it in the
 
05:16:08.628 --> 05:16:08.638 align:start position:0%
first place if the science was there we
 
05:16:10.270 --> 05:16:10.280 align:start position:0%
probably would be able to write a more
 
05:16:14.590 --> 05:16:14.600 align:start position:0%
clearer law uh so in Colorado I know
 
05:16:15.868 --> 05:16:15.878 align:start position:0%
they kind of I think that was the first
 
05:16:16.948 --> 05:16:16.958 align:start position:0%
state that kind of came up with this
 
05:16:19.510 --> 05:16:19.520 align:start position:0%
plan what do they have a rebuttable
 
05:16:21.910 --> 05:16:21.920 align:start position:0%
presumption what do they
 
05:16:26.150 --> 05:16:26.160 align:start position:0%
do chief there there I I believe but I I
 
05:16:27.868 --> 05:16:27.878 align:start position:0%
would have to fact check this uh I
 
05:16:30.310 --> 05:16:30.320 align:start position:0%
believe that they are more in a prima
 
05:16:32.270 --> 05:16:32.280 align:start position:0%
fascia uh
 
05:16:34.590 --> 05:16:34.600 align:start position:0%
uh realm in other words they've set a
 
05:16:38.628 --> 05:16:38.638 align:start position:0%
they've sent a limit that is simply a
 
05:16:40.868 --> 05:16:40.878 align:start position:0%
presumption that the person may be
 
05:16:43.948 --> 05:16:43.958 align:start position:0%
impaired by cannabis at that limit uh it
 
05:16:47.030 --> 05:16:47.040 align:start position:0%
is not a per se limit in in the sense
 
05:16:50.910 --> 05:16:50.920 align:start position:0%
that it uh results in an automatic or uh
 
05:16:54.590 --> 05:16:54.600 align:start position:0%
irrevocable uh determination the point
 
05:16:56.868 --> 05:16:56.878 align:start position:0%
uh with due respect uh to my colleague
 
05:17:00.270 --> 05:17:00.280 align:start position:0%
here is that people are impaired by
 
05:17:02.310 --> 05:17:02.320 align:start position:0%
cannabis it doesn't comp how they
 
05:17:05.670 --> 05:17:05.680 align:start position:0%
operate a motor vehicle right so to set
 
05:17:09.070 --> 05:17:09.080 align:start position:0%
to say that there is no limit is wildly
 
05:17:13.110 --> 05:17:13.120 align:start position:0%
viciously inaccurate uh impairment is
 
05:17:16.270 --> 05:17:16.280 align:start position:0%
proven by cannabis by multitudes of
 
05:17:19.190 --> 05:17:19.200 align:start position:0%
studies uh and you can watch those on on
 
05:17:21.150 --> 05:17:21.160 align:start position:0%
video if you like right and people
 
05:17:23.190 --> 05:17:23.200 align:start position:0%
driving through cones uh that knock the
 
05:17:25.070 --> 05:17:25.080 align:start position:0%
cones all over the place the point of
 
05:17:29.190 --> 05:17:29.200 align:start position:0%
the matter is Right does the state want
 
05:17:31.470 --> 05:17:31.480 align:start position:0%
in the likelihood of significant
 
05:17:31.480 --> 05:17:33.270 align:start position:0%
in the likelihood of significant
increased

05:17:33.270 --> 05:17:33.280 align:start position:0%
increased
 
05:17:35.628 --> 05:17:35.638 align:start position:0%
motorists operating Motor Vehicles on
 
05:17:37.590 --> 05:17:37.600 align:start position:0%
the roads of the State of New Hampshire
 
05:17:40.070 --> 05:17:40.080 align:start position:0%
that have consumed cannabis and become
 
05:17:42.110 --> 05:17:42.120 align:start position:0%
involved in a wreck or could potentially
 
05:17:44.548 --> 05:17:44.558 align:start position:0%
become involved in a wck or as we
 
05:17:46.548 --> 05:17:46.558 align:start position:0%
discussed earlier where there is no
 
05:17:49.390 --> 05:17:49.400 align:start position:0%
obser observation because you arrive at
 
05:17:52.788 --> 05:17:52.798 align:start position:0%
the scene of a wreck and uh you have an
 
05:17:55.430 --> 05:17:55.440 align:start position:0%
operator and there's no observation the
 
05:17:57.270 --> 05:17:57.280 align:start position:0%
operator may have been taken to the
 
05:18:00.350 --> 05:18:00.360 align:start position:0%
hospital so what do you have left uh if
 
05:18:04.548 --> 05:18:04.558 align:start position:0%
it's a SBI or fatal you have a blood
 
05:18:07.270 --> 05:18:07.280 align:start position:0%
test that's mandated under law currently
 
05:18:10.390 --> 05:18:10.400 align:start position:0%
right and it comes back uh if the person
 
05:18:14.190 --> 05:18:14.200 align:start position:0%
is showing um quantities of other
 
05:18:18.110 --> 05:18:18.120 align:start position:0%
illicit drugs that is considered by the
 
05:18:21.230 --> 05:18:21.240 align:start position:0%
judge uh in making a determination uh
 
05:18:22.910 --> 05:18:22.920 align:start position:0%
and I'm sure that you've represented a
 
05:18:26.070 --> 05:18:26.080 align:start position:0%
number of people in those cases uh this
 
05:18:30.430 --> 05:18:30.440 align:start position:0%
simply sets a a standard by which some
 
05:18:32.670 --> 05:18:32.680 align:start position:0%
degree of impairment
 
05:18:35.070 --> 05:18:35.080 align:start position:0%
indicates that the person could have
 
05:18:36.868 --> 05:18:36.878 align:start position:0%
been impaired and should be included
 
05:18:39.708 --> 05:18:39.718 align:start position:0%
with other facts and information along
 
05:18:41.310 --> 05:18:41.320 align:start position:0%
with the case because impairment by
 
05:18:45.390 --> 05:18:45.400 align:start position:0%
cannabis isn't isn't is a
 
05:18:48.030 --> 05:18:48.040 align:start position:0%
fact I'm with I'm not I'm not against
 
05:18:49.750 --> 05:18:49.760 align:start position:0%
the premise of it I'm just saying when
 
05:18:51.230 --> 05:18:51.240 align:start position:0%
when I the people that I represent that
 
05:18:52.628 --> 05:18:52.638 align:start position:0%
violate the law I'd like to kind of give
 
05:18:54.070 --> 05:18:54.080 align:start position:0%
them my heads up on how to comply with
 
05:18:56.110 --> 05:18:56.120 align:start position:0%
it that's what I'm getting at and the
 
05:18:58.948 --> 05:18:58.958 align:start position:0%
problem is and I had the same I had the
 
05:19:00.150 --> 05:19:00.160 align:start position:0%
issue I raised before with the open
 
05:19:03.628 --> 05:19:03.638 align:start position:0%
container part and all I'm saying is I I
 
05:19:05.910 --> 05:19:05.920 align:start position:0%
think we need to come up with something
 
05:19:07.350 --> 05:19:07.360 align:start position:0%
but for the sake of the bill we're
 
05:19:10.030 --> 05:19:10.040 align:start position:0%
putting together is it is it going to go
 
05:19:10.040 --> 05:19:10.830 align:start position:0%
putting together is it is it going to go
in

05:19:10.830 --> 05:19:10.840 align:start position:0%
in
 
05:19:14.110 --> 05:19:14.120 align:start position:0%
here Ju Just So let you know just in
 
05:19:16.590 --> 05:19:16.600 align:start position:0%
Colorado the limit Colorado for active
 
05:19:20.230 --> 05:19:20.240 align:start position:0%
Delta 9C in a driver's blood which gives
 
05:19:22.310 --> 05:19:22.320 align:start position:0%
rise to a permissible
 
05:19:24.430 --> 05:19:24.440 align:start position:0%
inference uh that the person is under
 
05:19:26.708 --> 05:19:26.718 align:start position:0%
the influence of can cannabis it's five
 
05:19:29.030 --> 05:19:29.040 align:start position:0%
nanograms or more per milliliter in the
 
05:19:32.548 --> 05:19:32.558 align:start position:0%
whole blood so I
 
05:19:35.150 --> 05:19:35.160 align:start position:0%
in court it's a permissible inference
 
05:19:38.788 --> 05:19:38.798 align:start position:0%
but it's not per se is there and
 
05:19:41.948 --> 05:19:41.958 align:start position:0%
Colorado if you look at their stats on
 
05:19:44.270 --> 05:19:44.280 align:start position:0%
traffic fatalities and and wrecks since
 
05:19:45.708 --> 05:19:45.718 align:start position:0%
they've legalized weed it's through the
 
05:19:47.670 --> 05:19:47.680 align:start position:0%
roof I mean they're not really a stellar
 
05:19:49.830 --> 05:19:49.840 align:start position:0%
example of how to be doing things no no
 
05:19:51.670 --> 05:19:51.680 align:start position:0%
I listen in Colorado keep in mind when
 
05:19:53.150 --> 05:19:53.160 align:start position:0%
they legalize this they're not
 
05:19:55.030 --> 05:19:55.040 align:start position:0%
surrounded by anyone else doing it where
 
05:19:57.110 --> 05:19:57.120 align:start position:0%
we surrounded on all sides so I think
 
05:19:59.670 --> 05:19:59.680 align:start position:0%
the the statistical impact I get it and
 
05:20:02.070 --> 05:20:02.080 align:start position:0%
it's but I'm just saying
 
05:20:03.510 --> 05:20:03.520 align:start position:0%
there's going to be people that violate
 
05:20:04.910 --> 05:20:04.920 align:start position:0%
the law who might not even realize
 
05:20:06.670 --> 05:20:06.680 align:start position:0%
they're doing it and that's what I'm
 
05:20:08.270 --> 05:20:08.280 align:start position:0%
worried there's going to be people that
 
05:20:10.150 --> 05:20:10.160 align:start position:0%
intentionally VI there's people that
 
05:20:12.350 --> 05:20:12.360 align:start position:0%
drink and drive and they just do it they
 
05:20:15.510 --> 05:20:15.520 align:start position:0%
don't care there but someone like myself
 
05:20:16.990 --> 05:20:17.000 align:start position:0%
I'm aware what legal liit is I know my
 
05:20:18.590 --> 05:20:18.600 align:start position:0%
body way I can do the math and you know
 
05:20:20.230 --> 05:20:20.240 align:start position:0%
I have a well I can have one drink but
 
05:20:23.390 --> 05:20:23.400 align:start position:0%
not two right before you know you it's
 
05:20:26.788 --> 05:20:26.798 align:start position:0%
kind of close right with this how do you
 
05:20:29.150 --> 05:20:29.160 align:start position:0%
tell someone how could someone like Dr
 
05:20:31.110 --> 05:20:31.120 align:start position:0%
youngren who's not here but how could
 
05:20:33.150 --> 05:20:33.160 align:start position:0%
would you tell a patient hey this is
 
05:20:35.110 --> 05:20:35.120 align:start position:0%
what it is you just I'm just saying
 
05:20:36.830 --> 05:20:36.840 align:start position:0%
there's no way to I'm trying to map it
 
05:20:39.430 --> 05:20:39.440 align:start position:0%
out and I don't see it there there's
 
05:20:41.868 --> 05:20:41.878 align:start position:0%
there's an e easy way to not violate the
 
05:20:45.150 --> 05:20:45.160 align:start position:0%
law don't smoke and drive smoking and
 
05:20:47.070 --> 05:20:47.080 align:start position:0%
driving is a separate that's a separate
 
05:20:48.270 --> 05:20:48.280 align:start position:0%
offense because you're using it while
 
05:20:49.548 --> 05:20:49.558 align:start position:0%
you're drive while you're actually
 
05:20:52.548 --> 05:20:52.558 align:start position:0%
driving what I'm saying is there's an
 
05:20:55.110 --> 05:20:55.120 align:start position:0%
accident right single car accident they
 
05:20:58.350 --> 05:20:58.360 align:start position:0%
do a they do a blood test on the driver
 
05:21:01.110 --> 05:21:01.120 align:start position:0%
all right they're can then get the
 
05:21:02.708 --> 05:21:02.718 align:start position:0%
results of that blood test and if you
 
05:21:04.670 --> 05:21:04.680 align:start position:0%
have this measurement in your blood keep
 
05:21:06.510 --> 05:21:06.520 align:start position:0%
in mind that person may not have used
 
05:21:10.390 --> 05:21:10.400 align:start position:0%
anything for a week now that probably
 
05:21:12.750 --> 05:21:12.760 align:start position:0%
means when you when you sit down at the
 
05:21:14.430 --> 05:21:14.440 align:start position:0%
black jab table you're putting your
 
05:21:16.310 --> 05:21:16.320 align:start position:0%
money on the line right you're not
 
05:21:18.830 --> 05:21:18.840 align:start position:0%
guaranteed to get a good hand or win I
 
05:21:20.430 --> 05:21:20.440 align:start position:0%
think if you want to choose to smoke
 
05:21:22.830 --> 05:21:22.840 align:start position:0%
weed you're GNA have to deal with the
 
05:21:25.230 --> 05:21:25.240 align:start position:0%
consequences no I I'm I'm with you on
 
05:21:27.390 --> 05:21:27.400 align:start position:0%
that but I'm just saying how much weed
 
05:21:29.310 --> 05:21:29.320 align:start position:0%
does someone smoke to reach the five
 
05:21:31.948 --> 05:21:31.958 align:start position:0%
nanograms no one knows one hit and
 
05:21:45.990 --> 05:21:46.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:48.788 --> 05:21:48.798 align:start position:0%
one have a one glass of wine and get
 
05:21:51.750 --> 05:21:51.760 align:start position:0%
behind the wheel and not be at
 
05:21:54.670 --> 05:21:54.680 align:start position:0%
08 so what we're doing really is just
 
05:21:56.510 --> 05:21:56.520 align:start position:0%
legalizing impairment that's what it
 
05:22:00.070 --> 05:22:00.080 align:start position:0%
comes down to no no look what I'm saying
 
05:22:02.910 --> 05:22:02.920 align:start position:0%
is if you just smoke and then drive
 
05:22:05.868 --> 05:22:05.878 align:start position:0%
you're you're you know as people say hi
 
05:22:08.430 --> 05:22:08.440 align:start position:0%
I get it if you don't do anything for a
 
05:22:10.750 --> 05:22:10.760 align:start position:0%
week you may still have cannabis in your
 
05:22:13.190 --> 05:22:13.200 align:start position:0%
system and I'm that's the person how do
 
05:22:17.510 --> 05:22:17.520 align:start position:0%
you distinguish that person who from so
 
05:22:18.590 --> 05:22:18.600 align:start position:0%
I have a question for you from the
 
05:22:20.310 --> 05:22:20.320 align:start position:0%
person who just smoked and drove that
 
05:22:22.350 --> 05:22:22.360 align:start position:0%
I'm with you on that 100% how do you
 
05:22:23.830 --> 05:22:23.840 align:start position:0%
drag someone in I don't want to drag
 
05:22:24.990 --> 05:22:25.000 align:start position:0%
someone in who hasn't done anything for
 
05:22:27.628 --> 05:22:27.638 align:start position:0%
a week but it's not the over archering
 
05:22:31.150 --> 05:22:31.160 align:start position:0%
and defining element for proving up a a
 
05:22:34.070 --> 05:22:34.080 align:start position:0%
conviction that's why in Colorado it's
 
05:22:37.310 --> 05:22:37.320 align:start position:0%
it's the permissible limit right it's
 
05:22:39.190 --> 05:22:39.200 align:start position:0%
not the overarching limit I think we're
 
05:22:40.750 --> 05:22:40.760 align:start position:0%
getting we're getting wrapped around the
 
05:22:45.030 --> 05:22:45.040 align:start position:0%
axle with uh hard line 08 versus the
 
05:22:47.548 --> 05:22:47.558 align:start position:0%
state who may have invested interest in
 
05:22:49.270 --> 05:22:49.280 align:start position:0%
public health and Public Safety on the
 
05:22:52.030 --> 05:22:52.040 align:start position:0%
highway simply stating we are going to
 
05:22:55.390 --> 05:22:55.400 align:start position:0%
add an element which couldn't be
 
05:22:58.670 --> 05:22:58.680 align:start position:0%
considered by the judge and the judge
 
05:23:01.470 --> 05:23:01.480 align:start position:0%
the Trier fact gives whatever way he or
 
05:23:05.590 --> 05:23:05.600 align:start position:0%
she wishes to that information coupled
 
05:23:08.150 --> 05:23:08.160 align:start position:0%
with the other evidence in the case
 
05:23:11.230 --> 05:23:11.240 align:start position:0%
Frank any question but is five a number
 
05:23:14.788 --> 05:23:14.798 align:start position:0%
that perhaps is well we heard testimony
 
05:23:17.750 --> 05:23:17.760 align:start position:0%
today that the NIH did a study uh that
 
05:23:22.030 --> 05:23:22.040 align:start position:0%
reflected that um uh 30,000 U
 
05:23:24.430 --> 05:23:24.440 align:start position:0%
respondents that reflected impairment at
 
05:23:24.440 --> 05:23:25.788 align:start position:0%
respondents that reflected impairment at
three

05:23:25.788 --> 05:23:25.798 align:start position:0%
three
 
05:23:27.948 --> 05:23:27.958 align:start position:0%
nanograms I mean I think going off of
 
05:23:29.628 --> 05:23:29.638 align:start position:0%
what we heard from the doctor there is
 
05:23:30.868 --> 05:23:30.878 align:start position:0%
no magic number and I think that's
 
05:23:32.390 --> 05:23:32.400 align:start position:0%
that's the problem and I think that's
 
05:23:34.230 --> 05:23:34.240 align:start position:0%
why it's really important that we invest
 
05:23:37.590 --> 05:23:37.600 align:start position:0%
in Dr you know law enforcement know how
 
05:23:37.600 --> 05:23:38.990 align:start position:0%
in Dr you know law enforcement know how
sorry

05:23:38.990 --> 05:23:39.000 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
05:23:42.750 --> 05:23:42.760 align:start position:0%
and either way we should probably have
 
05:23:46.070 --> 05:23:46.080 align:start position:0%
a this needs to be somehow studied we're
 
05:23:48.390 --> 05:23:48.400 align:start position:0%
all representatives of our people that
 
05:23:50.150 --> 05:23:50.160 align:start position:0%
of the State of New Hampshire this guy
 
05:23:52.830 --> 05:23:52.840 align:start position:0%
is not well we we we decide what's best
 
05:23:54.390 --> 05:23:54.400 align:start position:0%
for the people of New
 
05:23:56.628 --> 05:23:56.638 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I understand that but we want
 
05:23:58.948 --> 05:23:58.958 align:start position:0%
to do public advisory stuff and we need
 
05:24:01.350 --> 05:24:01.360 align:start position:0%
to advise people of certain things
 
05:24:03.030 --> 05:24:03.040 align:start position:0%
and I'm just explaining you may have
 
05:24:06.470 --> 05:24:06.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:09.590 --> 05:24:09.600 align:start position:0%
Canabis already illegal it's already
 
05:24:11.110 --> 05:24:11.120 align:start position:0%
illegal to drive with certain
 
05:24:13.390 --> 05:24:13.400 align:start position:0%
prescription drugs all right so no
 
05:24:14.750 --> 05:24:14.760 align:start position:0%
you're for no
 
05:24:17.310 --> 05:24:17.320 align:start position:0%
change I mean not adding that nanogram
 
05:24:20.350 --> 05:24:20.360 align:start position:0%
on no you don't need any nanogram on
 
05:24:22.070 --> 05:24:22.080 align:start position:0%
there because you've already got the
 
05:24:24.990 --> 05:24:25.000 align:start position:0%
entire situation of the stop to take
 
05:24:26.788 --> 05:24:26.798 align:start position:0%
into consideration the guy's bouncing
 
05:24:28.788 --> 05:24:28.798 align:start position:0%
between yellow and white you're going to
 
05:24:30.788 --> 05:24:30.798 align:start position:0%
stop him I would hope I think that you
 
05:24:30.798 --> 05:24:31.910 align:start position:0%
stop him I would hope I think that you
can

05:24:31.910 --> 05:24:31.920 align:start position:0%
can
 
05:24:34.190 --> 05:24:34.200 align:start position:0%
perhaps maybe were we were we word
 
05:24:35.670 --> 05:24:35.680 align:start position:0%
different than Colorado what if we word
 
05:24:38.430 --> 05:24:38.440 align:start position:0%
it in a way that it said it may be
 
05:24:41.430 --> 05:24:41.440 align:start position:0%
evidence thereof if someone's
 
05:24:43.390 --> 05:24:43.400 align:start position:0%
measurements over this no because
 
05:24:44.948 --> 05:24:44.958 align:start position:0%
Colorado can't build a straight road
 
05:24:47.590 --> 05:24:47.600 align:start position:0%
from the city to the
 
05:24:47.600 --> 05:24:49.868 align:start position:0%
from the city to the
airport

05:24:49.868 --> 05:24:49.878 align:start position:0%
airport
 
05:24:52.190 --> 05:24:52.200 align:start position:0%
just just to let you know I'm just
 
05:24:54.750 --> 05:24:54.760 align:start position:0%
giving information not advocating for
 
05:24:56.548 --> 05:24:56.558 align:start position:0%
Colorado but just to
 
05:24:59.548 --> 05:24:59.558 align:start position:0%
clarify um I read what the law was and
 
05:25:03.350 --> 05:25:03.360 align:start position:0%
this is from uh DWI attorney the best uh
 
05:25:06.070 --> 05:25:06.080 align:start position:0%
that says to prove you guilty of DUI and
 
05:25:07.310 --> 05:25:07.320 align:start position:0%
marijuana to
 
05:25:09.708 --> 05:25:09.718 align:start position:0%
prose who will need to show that you
 
05:25:12.590 --> 05:25:12.600 align:start position:0%
were actually too ston to drive safely
 
05:25:15.230 --> 05:25:15.240 align:start position:0%
such evidence might include just like
 
05:25:17.670 --> 05:25:17.680 align:start position:0%
any traffic stop you violated the
 
05:25:19.230 --> 05:25:19.240 align:start position:0%
traffic laws you're weaving in out of
 
05:25:21.070 --> 05:25:21.080 align:start position:0%
Lane you drove too fast or slow you
 
05:25:23.110 --> 05:25:23.120 align:start position:0%
appear stoned blood bloodshot eyes
 
05:25:25.150 --> 05:25:25.160 align:start position:0%
slurred speech the officer smelled
 
05:25:27.350 --> 05:25:27.360 align:start position:0%
marijuana in the C the uh there was
 
05:25:28.868 --> 05:25:28.878 align:start position:0%
marijuana paraphernalia in the vehicle
 
05:25:31.190 --> 05:25:31.200 align:start position:0%
rolling papers all that marijuana was
 
05:25:34.990 --> 05:25:35.000 align:start position:0%
found in youra but it goes on to say
 
05:25:37.230 --> 05:25:37.240 align:start position:0%
that a permissible inference just
 
05:25:40.070 --> 05:25:40.080 align:start position:0%
because you have that it doesn't mean
 
05:25:41.910 --> 05:25:41.920 align:start position:0%
it's proof of guilt it's just something
 
05:25:44.830 --> 05:25:44.840 align:start position:0%
that the judge can consider in the way
 
05:25:47.150 --> 05:25:47.160 align:start position:0%
we're talking about Dres I I agree with
 
05:25:48.430 --> 05:25:48.440 align:start position:0%
you we need the training please don't
 
05:25:51.270 --> 05:25:51.280 align:start position:0%
get me wrong but the way we're uh
 
05:25:52.990 --> 05:25:53.000 align:start position:0%
talking about di is it's it's almost
 
05:25:55.788 --> 05:25:55.798 align:start position:0%
like we don't even need if you take all
 
05:25:58.310 --> 05:25:58.320 align:start position:0%
that if you take all that for granted
 
05:25:59.788 --> 05:25:59.798 align:start position:0%
everything that's been said it's it's
 
05:25:59.798 --> 05:26:01.110 align:start position:0%
everything that's been said it's it's
like

05:26:01.110 --> 05:26:01.120 align:start position:0%
like
 
05:26:02.910 --> 05:26:02.920 align:start position:0%
we don't even need laws for alcohol
 
05:26:05.190 --> 05:26:05.200 align:start position:0%
limits if we have Dres that's not how it
 
05:26:07.750 --> 05:26:07.760 align:start position:0%
works you you need you still need some
 
05:26:11.628 --> 05:26:11.638 align:start position:0%
tools to be able to uh combat uh imper
 
05:26:14.910 --> 05:26:14.920 align:start position:0%
driving so it's Dres are going to help
 
05:26:16.628 --> 05:26:16.638 align:start position:0%
but there's a lot of other things that
 
05:26:19.030 --> 05:26:19.040 align:start position:0%
go into it including getting the
 
05:26:21.230 --> 05:26:21.240 align:start position:0%
educational piece out there to the
 
05:26:24.628 --> 05:26:24.638 align:start position:0%
public so now could it have the reverse
 
05:26:28.230 --> 05:26:28.240 align:start position:0%
effect no ST he's offsite way in um
 
05:26:29.708 --> 05:26:29.718 align:start position:0%
could it have the reverse effect so
 
05:26:31.430 --> 05:26:31.440 align:start position:0%
let's say the person all over the place
 
05:26:32.750 --> 05:26:32.760 align:start position:0%
they ran over the
 
05:26:34.628 --> 05:26:34.638 align:start position:0%
cones rise a
 
05:26:37.868 --> 05:26:37.878 align:start position:0%
bloodshot slur speech they take a blood
 
05:26:40.110 --> 05:26:40.120 align:start position:0%
test and they come back at you know
 
05:26:43.070 --> 05:26:43.080 align:start position:0%
point point or four nanograms
 
05:26:44.990 --> 05:26:45.000 align:start position:0%
right then it's going to go the other
 
05:26:47.830 --> 05:26:47.840 align:start position:0%
way right now it's exculpatory
 
05:26:51.590 --> 05:26:51.600 align:start position:0%
evidence it could it depends on um
 
05:26:53.788 --> 05:26:53.798 align:start position:0%
whether or not that permissible
 
05:26:56.110 --> 05:26:56.120 align:start position:0%
inference whatever that that level is is
 
05:27:00.070 --> 05:27:00.080 align:start position:0%
perceived as being definitive so um any
 
05:27:01.590 --> 05:27:01.600 align:start position:0%
any level
 
05:27:04.948 --> 05:27:04.958 align:start position:0%
either for blood alcohol content or for
 
05:27:08.270 --> 05:27:08.280 align:start position:0%
um intoxication from from drugs will be
 
05:27:10.270 --> 05:27:10.280 align:start position:0%
both over inclusive and under inclusive
 
05:27:12.628 --> 05:27:12.638 align:start position:0%
so uh the level of intoxication that
 
05:27:14.510 --> 05:27:14.520 align:start position:0%
someone may be at in terms of impairment
 
05:27:17.310 --> 05:27:17.320 align:start position:0%
of ability to drive a vehicle at Point
 
05:27:17.320 --> 05:27:17.990 align:start position:0%
of ability to drive a vehicle at Point
uh

05:27:17.990 --> 05:27:18.000 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:27:20.470 --> 05:27:20.480 align:start position:0%
08 may be different for different
 
05:27:23.948 --> 05:27:23.958 align:start position:0%
individuals it's a per se limit in the
 
05:27:27.548 --> 05:27:27.558 align:start position:0%
statute and it's um and so that has a
 
05:27:29.910 --> 05:27:29.920 align:start position:0%
consequence I think that the the issue
 
05:27:34.190 --> 05:27:34.200 align:start position:0%
or difference with uh the intoxication
 
05:27:37.990 --> 05:27:38.000 align:start position:0%
from uh THC is that that level of
 
05:27:40.708 --> 05:27:40.718 align:start position:0%
difference of impairment is it's broader
 
05:27:42.788 --> 05:27:42.798 align:start position:0%
uh that range is is wider and so it may
 
05:27:44.430 --> 05:27:44.440 align:start position:0%
be less informative there and it's just
 
05:27:46.190 --> 05:27:46.200 align:start position:0%
whether or not it's perceived by the
 
05:27:48.470 --> 05:27:48.480 align:start position:0%
finder a fact that it is determinative
 
05:27:51.430 --> 05:27:51.440 align:start position:0%
if it is at that or above that range I I
 
05:27:52.430 --> 05:27:52.440 align:start position:0%
think it's just really important to
 
05:27:53.830 --> 05:27:53.840 align:start position:0%
remember I think none of us here are
 
05:27:55.990 --> 05:27:56.000 align:start position:0%
advocating for people to drive and paed
 
05:27:57.150 --> 05:27:57.160 align:start position:0%
I think we're trying to figure out the
 
05:27:59.628 --> 05:27:59.638 align:start position:0%
effective way to deal with this issue
 
05:28:01.430 --> 05:28:01.440 align:start position:0%
and I I think it's just really important
 
05:28:04.788 --> 05:28:04.798 align:start position:0%
to remember from the science that there
 
05:28:07.310 --> 05:28:07.320 align:start position:0%
is no number and so if we are going to
 
05:28:09.230 --> 05:28:09.240 align:start position:0%
try and create a number we have to
 
05:28:10.470 --> 05:28:10.480 align:start position:0%
recognize that we are literally just
 
05:28:11.868 --> 05:28:11.878 align:start position:0%
pulling it out of thin air because
 
05:28:15.430 --> 05:28:15.440 align:start position:0%
there's no science to back it up um so I
 
05:28:16.708 --> 05:28:16.718 align:start position:0%
think you know we need to figure out how
 
05:28:18.310 --> 05:28:18.320 align:start position:0%
to address this but it's not just the
 
05:28:19.750 --> 05:28:19.760 align:start position:0%
number it's how does what a person
 
05:28:21.430 --> 05:28:21.440 align:start position:0%
arrive at the number what are they doing
 
05:28:23.070 --> 05:28:23.080 align:start position:0%
to get to that number in the first place
 
05:28:25.590 --> 05:28:25.600 align:start position:0%
and that's all science starts with a
 
05:28:28.070 --> 05:28:28.080 align:start position:0%
hypothesis we we just need to start with
 
05:28:32.350 --> 05:28:32.360 align:start position:0%
one and pick a number all science starts
 
05:28:36.708 --> 05:28:36.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:39.590 --> 05:28:39.600 align:start position:0%
question so two things one is you know
 
05:28:42.150 --> 05:28:42.160 align:start position:0%
you you keep discussing about what does
 
05:28:44.830 --> 05:28:44.840 align:start position:0%
it take to get to the Limit right well
 
05:28:47.510 --> 05:28:47.520 align:start position:0%
there's no difference in
 
05:28:51.788 --> 05:28:51.798 align:start position:0%
that hypothesis with someone who
 
05:28:55.230 --> 05:28:55.240 align:start position:0%
is your physique height and weight that
 
05:28:59.510 --> 05:28:59.520 align:start position:0%
uses different types of alcohol at a bar
 
05:29:01.548 --> 05:29:01.558 align:start position:0%
right and then is trying to determine
 
05:29:03.788 --> 05:29:03.798 align:start position:0%
the difference between having two
 
05:29:08.350 --> 05:29:08.360 align:start position:0%
glasses of wine or three shots or four
 
05:29:12.628 --> 05:29:12.638 align:start position:0%
shots of 40% alcohol or 60% alcohol it's
 
05:29:15.430 --> 05:29:15.440 align:start position:0%
the same thing right there is no magic
 
05:29:17.990 --> 05:29:18.000 align:start position:0%
number there is no chart that says on
 
05:29:20.628 --> 05:29:20.638 align:start position:0%
the wall of a bar or dis place that
 
05:29:22.910 --> 05:29:22.920 align:start position:0%
dispenses alcohol that says if you have
 
05:29:25.190 --> 05:29:25.200 align:start position:0%
four shots of this and you weigh 215
 
05:29:28.150 --> 05:29:28.160 align:start position:0%
pounds you're going to be 008 right so
 
05:29:29.670 --> 05:29:29.680 align:start position:0%
let's dispense with that for a moment
 
05:29:31.990 --> 05:29:32.000 align:start position:0%
because I think that's a farsal argument
 
05:29:34.750 --> 05:29:34.760 align:start position:0%
uh the the the last thing I'll I'll say
 
05:29:37.670 --> 05:29:37.680 align:start position:0%
is this no one in this
 
05:29:42.270 --> 05:29:42.280 align:start position:0%
room other than me my people have to go
 
05:29:45.788 --> 05:29:45.798 align:start position:0%
to a family and tell that family that
 
05:29:47.830 --> 05:29:47.840 align:start position:0%
the person that just plowed into the
 
05:29:50.708 --> 05:29:50.718 align:start position:0%
back of your husband who was 34
 
05:29:53.350 --> 05:29:53.360 align:start position:0%
nanograms from milliliter of cannabis
 
05:29:55.270 --> 05:29:55.280 align:start position:0%
and launched them in the back of a van
 
05:29:57.390 --> 05:29:57.400 align:start position:0%
and killed them could not get a
 
05:29:58.948 --> 05:29:58.958 align:start position:0%
conviction for
 
05:30:04.230 --> 05:30:04.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:07.510 --> 05:30:07.520 align:start position:0%
at Chief I I appreciate what you're
 
05:30:10.788 --> 05:30:10.798 align:start position:0%
saying but 34 and three is such a it's
 
05:30:14.030 --> 05:30:14.040 align:start position:0%
just different I but I'm not I
 
05:30:16.430 --> 05:30:16.440 align:start position:0%
understand what you're saying but 30
 
05:30:18.430 --> 05:30:18.440 align:start position:0%
three so I'm not I'm just saying if we
 
05:30:20.990 --> 05:30:21.000 align:start position:0%
made that number if it's three is it
 
05:30:22.788 --> 05:30:22.798 align:start position:0%
five it's it seven when it comes to the
 
05:30:24.868 --> 05:30:24.878 align:start position:0%
Committees in the legislator I'm not
 
05:30:26.270 --> 05:30:26.280 align:start position:0%
talking about in the I understand what
 
05:30:28.590 --> 05:30:28.600 align:start position:0%
you're saying but when we present this
 
05:30:31.150 --> 05:30:31.160 align:start position:0%
policy whether it's and the house
 
05:30:33.470 --> 05:30:33.480 align:start position:0%
criminal justice committee the Senate
 
05:30:35.150 --> 05:30:35.160 align:start position:0%
Judiciary Committee these are the
 
05:30:37.310 --> 05:30:37.320 align:start position:0%
questions that they're going to ask and
 
05:30:39.990 --> 05:30:40.000 align:start position:0%
all I'm trying to get at is if we had a
 
05:30:42.590 --> 05:30:42.600 align:start position:0%
number what that appropriate number is
 
05:30:45.510 --> 05:30:45.520 align:start position:0%
and really putting that into the context
 
05:30:47.948 --> 05:30:47.958 align:start position:0%
of what a person is how much they would
 
05:30:49.868 --> 05:30:49.878 align:start position:0%
it be ingesting to get to that point I'm
 
05:30:52.750 --> 05:30:52.760 align:start position:0%
not try trying to you're never going to
 
05:30:53.910 --> 05:30:53.920 align:start position:0%
get there take away from what you're
 
05:30:55.030 --> 05:30:55.040 align:start position:0%
saying because there is no there is no
 
05:30:56.910 --> 05:30:56.920 align:start position:0%
number we need to justify the number
 
05:30:59.270 --> 05:30:59.280 align:start position:0%
whatever line the sand we we come to we
 
05:31:01.788 --> 05:31:01.798 align:start position:0%
just I think explanation I just have to
 
05:31:04.990 --> 05:31:05.000 align:start position:0%
say there is no number and this is the
 
05:31:08.110 --> 05:31:08.120 align:start position:0%
most irresponsible dangerous legislation
 
05:31:11.110 --> 05:31:11.120 align:start position:0%
that I have ever participated in it's
 
05:31:13.590 --> 05:31:13.600 align:start position:0%
very disappointing because we are going
 
05:31:18.830 --> 05:31:18.840 align:start position:0%
to increase death addiction and it it's
 
05:31:19.788 --> 05:31:19.798 align:start position:0%
it's a
 
05:31:22.910 --> 05:31:22.920 align:start position:0%
travesty well I I appreciate the
 
05:31:24.750 --> 05:31:24.760 align:start position:0%
comments all right I'm
 
05:31:27.270 --> 05:31:27.280 align:start position:0%
not I've seen other versions of this
 
05:31:29.390 --> 05:31:29.400 align:start position:0%
these legislations that I've would say
 
05:31:31.788 --> 05:31:31.798 align:start position:0%
had some pre agre of stuff in there
 
05:31:33.750 --> 05:31:33.760 align:start position:0%
right we're trying to minimize some of
 
05:31:37.430 --> 05:31:37.440 align:start position:0%
those negative impacts can we do it 100%
 
05:31:40.590 --> 05:31:40.600 align:start position:0%
no so which before we debate if we want
 
05:31:42.270 --> 05:31:42.280 align:start position:0%
to debate the morals of legalizing or
 
05:31:45.510 --> 05:31:45.520 align:start position:0%
not the commission's direction our
 
05:31:47.150 --> 05:31:47.160 align:start position:0%
directive of this commission is to put
 
05:31:50.430 --> 05:31:50.440 align:start position:0%
together legislation for State operated
 
05:31:53.150 --> 05:31:53.160 align:start position:0%
a state controlled model okay I
 
05:31:54.230 --> 05:31:54.240 align:start position:0%
understand to some people on here that
 
05:31:56.430 --> 05:31:56.440 align:start position:0%
we don't necessarily support
 
05:31:58.868 --> 05:31:58.878 align:start position:0%
legalization right and I I can say with
 
05:32:00.430 --> 05:32:00.440 align:start position:0%
um and I'm sure my friends in the
 
05:32:01.510 --> 05:32:01.520 align:start position:0%
industry here I'm not even sure they
 
05:32:03.150 --> 05:32:03.160 align:start position:0%
consider me a friend because I've did so
 
05:32:05.350 --> 05:32:05.360 align:start position:0%
much work helping defeat canis
 
05:32:06.708 --> 05:32:06.718 align:start position:0%
legislation as a
 
05:32:08.788 --> 05:32:08.798 align:start position:0%
legislator I was the one vote by the way
 
05:32:11.670 --> 05:32:11.680 align:start position:0%
for that nonprofit but the states that
 
05:32:14.590 --> 05:32:14.600 align:start position:0%
set those limits and there's uh more
 
05:32:16.510 --> 05:32:16.520 align:start position:0%
than several I'm just saying I'm set a
 
05:32:18.830 --> 05:32:18.840 align:start position:0%
limit under the same circumstances that
 
05:32:20.070 --> 05:32:20.080 align:start position:0%
you're discussing they don't have a
 
05:32:22.230 --> 05:32:22.240 align:start position:0%
scientific limit but when when when
 
05:32:24.070 --> 05:32:24.080 align:start position:0%
saying irresponsible we're we're
 
05:32:25.868 --> 05:32:25.878 align:start position:0%
contributing to that there's no one
 
05:32:28.830 --> 05:32:28.840 align:start position:0%
who's who's been analyzing the potential
 
05:32:31.190 --> 05:32:31.200 align:start position:0%
negative impacts of cannabis
 
05:32:32.548 --> 05:32:32.558 align:start position:0%
since that I've been in the legis I
 
05:32:34.910 --> 05:32:34.920 align:start position:0%
think I take first place all right in my
 
05:32:37.190 --> 05:32:37.200 align:start position:0%
two terms in the house and in the Senate
 
05:32:38.470 --> 05:32:38.480 align:start position:0%
and I look at everything we can to
 
05:32:40.430 --> 05:32:40.440 align:start position:0%
minimize all these impacts because I
 
05:32:42.470 --> 05:32:42.480 align:start position:0%
look at what's happening around us and
 
05:32:44.070 --> 05:32:44.080 align:start position:0%
it is a problem there's people using
 
05:32:46.030 --> 05:32:46.040 align:start position:0%
drugs there's opioids all right don't
 
05:32:47.070 --> 05:32:47.080 align:start position:0%
think I don't know anyone that's passed
 
05:32:49.150 --> 05:32:49.160 align:start position:0%
away from drug overdoses I think I even
 
05:32:50.628 --> 05:32:50.638 align:start position:0%
lost friends to that so when you say
 
05:32:52.470 --> 05:32:52.480 align:start position:0%
that I'm encouraging that I find it
 
05:32:54.430 --> 05:32:54.440 align:start position:0%
insultive it's not I do find it
 
05:32:57.270 --> 05:32:57.280 align:start position:0%
insulting so I'm telling you I'm just
 
05:32:58.948 --> 05:32:58.958 align:start position:0%
being honest with
 
05:33:03.070 --> 05:33:03.080 align:start position:0%
you dis you are four times more likely
 
05:33:03.080 --> 05:33:03.990 align:start position:0%
you dis you are four times more likely
it's

05:33:03.990 --> 05:33:04.000 align:start position:0%
it's
 
05:33:08.350 --> 05:33:08.360 align:start position:0%
a to opioid disorder we will see we to
 
05:33:12.310 --> 05:33:12.320 align:start position:0%
see our already over those death rates
 
05:33:14.750 --> 05:33:14.760 align:start position:0%
increase that is sence and what do we do
 
05:33:16.310 --> 05:33:16.320 align:start position:0%
about all the New Hampshire plates that
 
05:33:18.030 --> 05:33:18.040 align:start position:0%
you go sit in all these dispensaries and
 
05:33:19.788 --> 05:33:19.798 align:start position:0%
they're everywhere so the Reaper Madness
 
05:33:21.628 --> 05:33:21.638 align:start position:0%
everyone talks about is here already I
 
05:33:23.830 --> 05:33:23.840 align:start position:0%
see it all the time I even smell when
 
05:33:25.910 --> 05:33:25.920 align:start position:0%
I'm walking around outside so there are
 
05:33:27.628 --> 05:33:27.638 align:start position:0%
problems I get it and and what we're
 
05:33:30.788 --> 05:33:30.798 align:start position:0%
trying to do is actually do this not
 
05:33:35.030 --> 05:33:35.040 align:start position:0%
like every other state all right but if
 
05:33:36.708 --> 05:33:36.718 align:start position:0%
that's the commission here the charge of
 
05:33:38.470 --> 05:33:38.480 align:start position:0%
this commission is to put together that
 
05:33:40.830 --> 05:33:40.840 align:start position:0%
legislation okay and that that's what
 
05:33:43.230 --> 05:33:43.240 align:start position:0%
we're here to do all right so I
 
05:33:45.270 --> 05:33:45.280 align:start position:0%
understand there's some negative this
 
05:33:47.230 --> 05:33:47.240 align:start position:0%
there is some negative social impacts of
 
05:33:49.310 --> 05:33:49.320 align:start position:0%
course I get
 
05:33:52.070 --> 05:33:52.080 align:start position:0%
it uh with that being said moving on to
 
05:33:53.628 --> 05:33:53.638 align:start position:0%
the next subject since we don't have a
 
05:33:56.430 --> 05:33:56.440 align:start position:0%
consensus on how to have the measurement
 
05:33:58.030 --> 05:33:58.040 align:start position:0%
um analyzed
 
05:34:01.310 --> 05:34:01.320 align:start position:0%
yet uh the other animated subject I'm
 
05:34:03.910 --> 05:34:03.920 align:start position:0%
glad our friends from the atcs are here
 
05:34:06.070 --> 05:34:06.080 align:start position:0%
was the concept
 
05:34:09.548 --> 05:34:09.558 align:start position:0%
of if with the Dual licenses where
 
05:34:11.868 --> 05:34:11.878 align:start position:0%
suppose an ATC wanted to become a retail
 
05:34:14.868 --> 05:34:14.878 align:start position:0%
store how would that work out and where
 
05:34:17.270 --> 05:34:17.280 align:start position:0%
would their their regulation fall
 
05:34:20.948 --> 05:34:20.958 align:start position:0%
under is there a consensus on that issue
 
05:34:22.030 --> 05:34:22.040 align:start position:0%
and if you guys just want to take the
 
05:34:25.510 --> 05:34:25.520 align:start position:0%
microphone while you're here um I think
 
05:34:29.070 --> 05:34:29.080 align:start position:0%
the idea was they are voluntarily asking
 
05:34:31.548 --> 05:34:31.558 align:start position:0%
to become a retail ja store no one's
 
05:34:32.788 --> 05:34:32.798 align:start position:0%
making them do
 
05:34:35.030 --> 05:34:35.040 align:start position:0%
anything they fill out the
 
05:34:37.990 --> 05:34:38.000 align:start position:0%
application they get
 
05:34:40.110 --> 05:34:40.120 align:start position:0%
approved I didn't like the idea of them
 
05:34:42.190 --> 05:34:42.200 align:start position:0%
having two signs in one
 
05:34:44.948 --> 05:34:44.958 align:start position:0%
store but the idea was they they would
 
05:34:47.070 --> 05:34:47.080 align:start position:0%
um they're not guaranteed to get
 
05:34:48.868 --> 05:34:48.878 align:start position:0%
approved but they would obviously make a
 
05:34:51.190 --> 05:34:51.200 align:start position:0%
very um appealing candidate given their
 
05:34:53.190 --> 05:34:53.200 align:start position:0%
experience in the industry but they
 
05:34:54.510 --> 05:34:54.520 align:start position:0%
would lose their store
 
05:34:58.788 --> 05:34:58.798 align:start position:0%
fund and then the idea was well if
 
05:35:00.590 --> 05:35:00.600 align:start position:0%
they're going to be they have experience
 
05:35:01.910 --> 05:35:01.920 align:start position:0%
in manufacturing you know would say
 
05:35:03.350 --> 05:35:03.360 align:start position:0%
therapeutic grade
 
05:35:05.510 --> 05:35:05.520 align:start position:0%
products the long-term branding is not
 
05:35:07.830 --> 05:35:07.840 align:start position:0%
their store it's the product right
 
05:35:10.070 --> 05:35:10.080 align:start position:0%
perhaps allowing the other retail stores
 
05:35:11.510 --> 05:35:11.520 align:start position:0%
at their discretion if they choose to
 
05:35:13.708 --> 05:35:13.718 align:start position:0%
sell a contract with them would be
 
05:35:16.070 --> 05:35:16.080 align:start position:0%
permitted to distribute ATC products as
 
05:35:18.230 --> 05:35:18.240 align:start position:0%
well but we would kind of leave the
 
05:35:20.510 --> 05:35:20.520 align:start position:0%
three existing manufacturers shall we
 
05:35:23.948 --> 05:35:23.958 align:start position:0%
say um maybe consider them grandfathered
 
05:35:23.958 --> 05:35:25.948 align:start position:0%
say um maybe consider them grandfathered
in

05:35:25.948 --> 05:35:25.958 align:start position:0%
in
 
05:35:30.150 --> 05:35:30.160 align:start position:0%
and and then my other concern was uh and
 
05:35:31.708 --> 05:35:31.718 align:start position:0%
I don't mean this as a knock or any
 
05:35:35.708 --> 05:35:35.718 align:start position:0%
disrespected DHHS but you have liquor
 
05:35:37.390 --> 05:35:37.400 align:start position:0%
who would be in charge of enforcement of
 
05:35:39.590 --> 05:35:39.600 align:start position:0%
the retail side of things yet they would
 
05:35:41.830 --> 05:35:41.840 align:start position:0%
have their retailers or their
 
05:35:43.910 --> 05:35:43.920 align:start position:0%
franchisees selling products they have
 
05:35:46.590 --> 05:35:46.600 align:start position:0%
no control of the regulation of and I
 
05:35:49.350 --> 05:35:49.360 align:start position:0%
thought that that from the public
 
05:35:51.270 --> 05:35:51.280 align:start position:0%
perspective they see cannabis it's
 
05:35:53.350 --> 05:35:53.360 align:start position:0%
cannabis so that would create confusion
 
05:35:55.910 --> 05:35:55.920 align:start position:0%
and by putting the DHHS rulem for
 
05:35:58.150 --> 05:35:58.160 align:start position:0%
Therapeutics under liquor I think it
 
05:36:00.590 --> 05:36:00.600 align:start position:0%
would kind of unify everything and
 
05:36:03.948 --> 05:36:03.958 align:start position:0%
hopefully eliminate any potential
 
05:36:05.830 --> 05:36:05.840 align:start position:0%
inconsistencies only thing remaining on
 
05:36:08.150 --> 05:36:08.160 align:start position:0%
DHHS would be the license or the sorry
 
05:36:11.390 --> 05:36:11.400 align:start position:0%
the therapeutic cards like that
 
05:36:13.628 --> 05:36:13.638 align:start position:0%
procedure so you're basically taking it
 
05:36:16.948 --> 05:36:16.958 align:start position:0%
and reassigning it under a different
 
05:36:21.270 --> 05:36:21.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:27.590 --> 05:36:27.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:31.548 --> 05:36:31.558 align:start position:0%
that for better for worse
 
05:36:33.990 --> 05:36:34.000 align:start position:0%
so so again I'm not saying your support
 
05:36:35.430 --> 05:36:35.440 align:start position:0%
does not mean you support the the
 
05:36:38.270 --> 05:36:38.280 align:start position:0%
underlying Bill itself but in consider
 
05:36:40.948 --> 05:36:40.958 align:start position:0%
if the this became law would you rather
 
05:36:44.510 --> 05:36:44.520 align:start position:0%
there be dual licenses I think if you're
 
05:36:47.310 --> 05:36:47.320 align:start position:0%
G to have a a franchise who's offering
 
05:36:48.990 --> 05:36:49.000 align:start position:0%
who's purchasing a franchise from the
 
05:36:51.150 --> 05:36:51.160 align:start position:0%
state for them to sell their own
 
05:36:52.750 --> 05:36:52.760 align:start position:0%
products and have their sign in their
 
05:36:54.310 --> 05:36:54.320 align:start position:0%
creates and unfair Market Advantage for
 
05:36:58.150 --> 05:36:58.160 align:start position:0%
the atcs they're asking to be retail
 
05:36:59.150 --> 05:36:59.160 align:start position:0%
their choice they're not we're not
 
05:37:00.990 --> 05:37:01.000 align:start position:0%
forcing them to give it up they're decid
 
05:37:02.430 --> 05:37:02.440 align:start position:0%
they're asking they're basically
 
05:37:04.070 --> 05:37:04.080 align:start position:0%
voluntarily doing but in exchange for
 
05:37:06.948 --> 05:37:06.958 align:start position:0%
that you know their brand product but I
 
05:37:08.830 --> 05:37:08.840 align:start position:0%
also think that for the therapeutic
 
05:37:10.708 --> 05:37:10.718 align:start position:0%
program it allows it to
 
05:37:14.070 --> 05:37:14.080 align:start position:0%
have some uh more ways to distribute
 
05:37:17.708 --> 05:37:17.718 align:start position:0%
their product
 
05:37:20.830 --> 05:37:20.840 align:start position:0%
um if I'm not Mis mistaken the way it
 
05:37:23.270 --> 05:37:23.280 align:start position:0%
works with an alternate Treatment Center
 
05:37:27.190 --> 05:37:27.200 align:start position:0%
is you advise the client as to which
 
05:37:29.670 --> 05:37:29.680 align:start position:0%
type of product would best suit their
 
05:37:32.110 --> 05:37:32.120 align:start position:0%
prescriptive need that is given to you
 
05:37:35.070 --> 05:37:35.080 align:start position:0%
by say Pain Solutions or one of the pain
 
05:37:37.830 --> 05:37:37.840 align:start position:0%
management companies uh for
 
05:37:40.150 --> 05:37:40.160 align:start position:0%
example uh whether it's to increase
 
05:37:43.030 --> 05:37:43.040 align:start position:0%
appetite whether it's to relieve pain or
 
05:37:46.270 --> 05:37:46.280 align:start position:0%
something of that nature so that is an
 
05:37:48.390 --> 05:37:48.400 align:start position:0%
advisory type of activity by the
 
05:37:51.948 --> 05:37:51.958 align:start position:0%
alternate treatment centers whereas the
 
05:37:53.990 --> 05:37:54.000 align:start position:0%
recreational stuff is we got this for
 
05:37:55.628 --> 05:37:55.638 align:start position:0%
sale you buy whatever you
 
05:38:00.990 --> 05:38:01.000 align:start position:0%
want uh to be crude about it but
 
05:38:02.590 --> 05:38:02.600 align:start position:0%
that's basically what you're talking
 
05:38:05.670 --> 05:38:05.680 align:start position:0%
about having operate is that
 
05:38:08.270 --> 05:38:08.280 align:start position:0%
correct I think if you allow only some
 
05:38:11.430 --> 05:38:11.440 align:start position:0%
atcs to sell the I mean sorry some
 
05:38:13.510 --> 05:38:13.520 align:start position:0%
retail stores or franchises to sell
 
05:38:16.590 --> 05:38:16.600 align:start position:0%
therapeutic products and not others the
 
05:38:17.788 --> 05:38:17.798 align:start position:0%
problem is that's an unfair Market
 
05:38:22.350 --> 05:38:22.360 align:start position:0%
advantage that's my problem and that it
 
05:38:25.470 --> 05:38:25.480 align:start position:0%
it how do you resolve that now at the
 
05:38:25.480 --> 05:38:28.510 align:start position:0%
it how do you resolve that now at the
same

05:38:28.510 --> 05:38:28.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:30.590 --> 05:38:30.600 align:start position:0%
time well they they're also not
 
05:38:32.150 --> 05:38:32.160 align:start position:0%
obligated to sell their therapy to
 
05:38:33.310 --> 05:38:33.320 align:start position:0%
product to other stores but the other
 
05:38:34.868 --> 05:38:34.878 align:start position:0%
stores have the opportunity to do that
 
05:38:37.070 --> 05:38:37.080 align:start position:0%
but in exchange they're going to give up
 
05:38:38.788 --> 05:38:38.798 align:start position:0%
their storefront I think that that's a
 
05:38:41.270 --> 05:38:41.280 align:start position:0%
pretty good exchange it's all being done
 
05:38:41.280 --> 05:38:42.910 align:start position:0%
pretty good exchange it's all being done
voluntarily

05:38:42.910 --> 05:38:42.920 align:start position:0%
voluntarily
 
05:38:45.150 --> 05:38:45.160 align:start position:0%
but they like this storefront trust me
 
05:38:47.628 --> 05:38:47.638 align:start position:0%
and they want to keep
 
05:38:51.548 --> 05:38:51.558 align:start position:0%
it yeah one ask I mean but I I think
 
05:38:54.830 --> 05:38:54.840 align:start position:0%
from a policy exchange that that's not
 
05:38:54.840 --> 05:38:58.430 align:start position:0%
from a policy exchange that that's not
um

05:38:58.430 --> 05:38:58.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:58.440 --> 05:39:02.230 align:start position:0%
 
outrageous

05:39:02.230 --> 05:39:02.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:05.030 --> 05:39:05.040 align:start position:0%
and speak freely thank you Mr chairman
 
05:39:06.750 --> 05:39:06.760 align:start position:0%
again for the record Matt Simon Granite
 
05:39:10.628 --> 05:39:10.638 align:start position:0%
Leaf cannabis and I'll add Brandon y uh
 
05:39:13.150 --> 05:39:13.160 align:start position:0%
Brandon Pollock I am excuse me with h
 
05:39:16.350 --> 05:39:16.360 align:start position:0%
tascal wellness and Keenan blums right
 
05:39:18.270 --> 05:39:18.280 align:start position:0%
behind us also Granite Leaf cannabis
 
05:39:19.350 --> 05:39:19.360 align:start position:0%
just wanted to draw your attention we
 
05:39:21.868 --> 05:39:21.878 align:start position:0%
did circulate a memo earlier pass that
 
05:39:23.990 --> 05:39:24.000 align:start position:0%
out it's the one titled integrating the
 
05:39:25.150 --> 05:39:25.160 align:start position:0%
TCP and
 
05:39:27.670 --> 05:39:27.680 align:start position:0%
atc's with the franchise model and
 
05:39:29.430 --> 05:39:29.440 align:start position:0%
there's also an attachment with some
 
05:39:32.788 --> 05:39:32.798 align:start position:0%
some uh possible Bill language uh that
 
05:39:34.390 --> 05:39:34.400 align:start position:0%
goes along with that we didn't pass them
 
05:39:35.948 --> 05:39:35.958 align:start position:0%
out together so you may have trouble
 
05:39:37.708 --> 05:39:37.718 align:start position:0%
finding them both and putting together
 
05:39:39.350 --> 05:39:39.360 align:start position:0%
sorry about that uh but thank you for
 
05:39:41.548 --> 05:39:41.558 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to comment uh we we've
 
05:39:42.750 --> 05:39:42.760 align:start position:0%
looked at this from a number of
 
05:39:44.510 --> 05:39:44.520 align:start position:0%
perspectives we've participated and
 
05:39:47.190 --> 05:39:47.200 align:start position:0%
observed all of these discussions it
 
05:39:48.868 --> 05:39:48.878 align:start position:0%
seems to us that there are three
 
05:39:51.708 --> 05:39:51.718 align:start position:0%
possible ways to integrate the TCP and
 
05:39:54.310 --> 05:39:54.320 align:start position:0%
the atc's with the franchise model one
 
05:39:57.990 --> 05:39:58.000 align:start position:0%
is a dual regulatory structure uh uh one
 
05:39:59.910 --> 05:39:59.920 align:start position:0%
would be moving everything thing under
 
05:40:02.270 --> 05:40:02.280 align:start position:0%
the lior commission and one would be uh
 
05:40:04.310 --> 05:40:04.320 align:start position:0%
what the chairman just referred to which
 
05:40:07.030 --> 05:40:07.040 align:start position:0%
would be sort of a hybrid approach where
 
05:40:09.468 --> 05:40:09.478 align:start position:0%
DHHS would maintain a role in issuing
 
05:40:11.750 --> 05:40:11.760 align:start position:0%
the cards in maintaining the patient
 
05:40:14.628 --> 05:40:14.638 align:start position:0%
registry and and uh overseeing perhaps
 
05:40:16.350 --> 05:40:16.360 align:start position:0%
the education and support we provide to
 
05:40:18.628 --> 05:40:18.638 align:start position:0%
registered patients uh but all the
 
05:40:21.390 --> 05:40:21.400 align:start position:0%
business regulation would move under the
 
05:40:23.390 --> 05:40:23.400 align:start position:0%
Liquor Commission so we would not be in
 
05:40:25.310 --> 05:40:25.320 align:start position:0%
any sense serving two masters from a
 
05:40:27.150 --> 05:40:27.160 align:start position:0%
business perspective that seedling to
 
05:40:29.708 --> 05:40:29.718 align:start position:0%
sale regulation would be handed handled
 
05:40:31.750 --> 05:40:31.760 align:start position:0%
by The Liquor Commission in light of the
 
05:40:33.390 --> 05:40:33.400 align:start position:0%
conversations we've heard we think that
 
05:40:37.270 --> 05:40:37.280 align:start position:0%
may be the most logical approach um if
 
05:40:38.990 --> 05:40:39.000 align:start position:0%
the commission if the study commission
 
05:40:40.430 --> 05:40:40.440 align:start position:0%
does want to move forward with that
 
05:40:42.190 --> 05:40:42.200 align:start position:0%
approach uh we would then want to do the
 
05:40:44.910 --> 05:40:44.920 align:start position:0%
work of going through 126x and and
 
05:40:46.750 --> 05:40:46.760 align:start position:0%
noting all the things that would need to
 
05:40:49.750 --> 05:40:49.760 align:start position:0%
to change to make these uh uh the
 
05:40:51.590 --> 05:40:51.600 align:start position:0%
franchise model consistent with the
 
05:40:54.468 --> 05:40:54.478 align:start position:0%
existing law we think that's manageable
 
05:40:56.910 --> 05:40:56.920 align:start position:0%
if DHHS is still handling the registry
 
05:40:59.310 --> 05:40:59.320 align:start position:0%
and ID cards a big chunk of the
 
05:41:01.670 --> 05:41:01.680 align:start position:0%
therapeutic canvas law can remain
 
05:41:04.788 --> 05:41:04.798 align:start position:0%
relatively untouched and uh the business
 
05:41:07.750 --> 05:41:07.760 align:start position:0%
sections would require some
 
05:41:07.760 --> 05:41:09.750 align:start position:0%
sections would require some
modifications

05:41:09.750 --> 05:41:09.760 align:start position:0%
modifications
 
05:41:09.760 --> 05:41:14.070 align:start position:0%
modifications
so

05:41:14.070 --> 05:41:14.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:16.788 --> 05:41:16.798 align:start position:0%
um any comments comments on that so far
 
05:41:16.798 --> 05:41:21.030 align:start position:0%
um any comments comments on that so far
we

05:41:21.030 --> 05:41:21.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:23.628 --> 05:41:23.638 align:start position:0%
can Qui question for me probably at
 
05:41:25.708 --> 05:41:25.718 align:start position:0%
least knowledgeable up here um so you're
 
05:41:27.070 --> 05:41:27.080 align:start position:0%
going to be able to sell stuff up to
 
05:41:30.990 --> 05:41:31.000 align:start position:0%
like a 98% THC to therapeutic patients
 
05:41:33.708 --> 05:41:33.718 align:start position:0%
only who come in with the card right and
 
05:41:35.670 --> 05:41:35.680 align:start position:0%
then you you'll sell to someone else who
 
05:41:37.070 --> 05:41:37.080 align:start position:0%
comes in just
 
05:41:40.270 --> 05:41:40.280 align:start position:0%
for cons regular consumption a product
 
05:41:42.830 --> 05:41:42.840 align:start position:0%
that's going to be limited to 15% and
 
05:41:44.390 --> 05:41:44.400 align:start position:0%
we'll have or something whatever the
 
05:41:46.910 --> 05:41:46.920 align:start position:0%
number is so there are no potency limits
 
05:41:49.830 --> 05:41:49.840 align:start position:0%
in the therapeutic canvas law uh and
 
05:41:52.628 --> 05:41:52.638 align:start position:0%
there are no potency limits in terms of
 
05:41:54.708 --> 05:41:54.718 align:start position:0%
percentage for inhalables in the draft
 
05:41:56.190 --> 05:41:56.200 align:start position:0%
that we've seen I'm not aware of the
 
05:41:58.310 --> 05:41:58.320 align:start position:0%
study commission ever ever doing that
 
05:42:00.310 --> 05:42:00.320 align:start position:0%
it's actually left to Ru making to
 
05:42:02.390 --> 05:42:02.400 align:start position:0%
determine what potency limits would be
 
05:42:03.750 --> 05:42:03.760 align:start position:0%
but I I believe the essence of what
 
05:42:05.628 --> 05:42:05.638 align:start position:0%
you're asking is correct that that that
 
05:42:07.350 --> 05:42:07.360 align:start position:0%
would still still be the case how long
 
05:42:10.070 --> 05:42:10.080 align:start position:0%
has the ru making
 
05:42:13.190 --> 05:42:13.200 align:start position:0%
uh the ru making Authority been in
 
05:42:15.708 --> 05:42:15.718 align:start position:0%
place for the therapeutic program it's
 
05:42:17.590 --> 05:42:17.600 align:start position:0%
been in place uh well was created by the
 
05:42:20.708 --> 05:42:20.718 align:start position:0%
law that passed in 2013 and uh the rules
 
05:42:24.590 --> 05:42:24.600 align:start position:0%
were I believe finished in 2015 so like
 
05:42:27.708 --> 05:42:27.718 align:start position:0%
for my my point is that the rul making
 
05:42:30.628 --> 05:42:30.638 align:start position:0%
in respect to that
 
05:42:32.030 --> 05:42:32.040 align:start position:0%
I guess when it comes to enforcement of
 
05:42:33.948 --> 05:42:33.958 align:start position:0%
that you know a lot of that's going to
 
05:42:35.750 --> 05:42:35.760 align:start position:0%
fall under
 
05:42:37.788 --> 05:42:37.798 align:start position:0%
liquor it's just going to get it's not
 
05:42:39.430 --> 05:42:39.440 align:start position:0%
getting eliminated it's just getting
 
05:42:41.270 --> 05:42:41.280 align:start position:0%
taken out and put in here you're picking
 
05:42:43.590 --> 05:42:43.600 align:start position:0%
up and moving it you're talking about
 
05:42:45.590 --> 05:42:45.600 align:start position:0%
the regulation of businesses I believe
 
05:42:47.310 --> 05:42:47.320 align:start position:0%
that would all move under liquor the
 
05:42:49.830 --> 05:42:49.840 align:start position:0%
question of potency restrictions whether
 
05:42:52.030 --> 05:42:52.040 align:start position:0%
they exist or not what they would be I
 
05:42:54.230 --> 05:42:54.240 align:start position:0%
think that's a decision either to be
 
05:42:57.030 --> 05:42:57.040 align:start position:0%
made in statute or as is currently the
 
05:42:59.548 --> 05:42:59.558 align:start position:0%
case left of rulemaking I think I may
 
05:43:00.590 --> 05:43:00.600 align:start position:0%
actually be in agreement with the
 
05:43:01.910 --> 05:43:01.920 align:start position:0%
prevention folks that it would be better
 
05:43:04.350 --> 05:43:04.360 align:start position:0%
to decide in statute that would provide
 
05:43:06.510 --> 05:43:06.520 align:start position:0%
a lot of clarity to businesses on what
 
05:43:10.788 --> 05:43:10.798 align:start position:0%
they're actually getting into if uh no I
 
05:43:14.150 --> 05:43:14.160 align:start position:0%
I agree um I'm just my my point is to
 
05:43:15.708 --> 05:43:15.718 align:start position:0%
the extent that that's subject to rul
 
05:43:17.788 --> 05:43:17.798 align:start position:0%
making if they're going to enforce the
 
05:43:19.510 --> 05:43:19.520 align:start position:0%
potency limits being sold in the store
 
05:43:20.788 --> 05:43:20.798 align:start position:0%
shouldn't they be involved in the rul
 
05:43:22.830 --> 05:43:22.840 align:start position:0%
making process for what the potency is
 
05:43:24.430 --> 05:43:24.440 align:start position:0%
if that's the case if we don't legislate
 
05:43:26.350 --> 05:43:26.360 align:start position:0%
it that's what I'm getting at that's
 
05:43:27.750 --> 05:43:27.760 align:start position:0%
that's why I like the idea of putting it
 
05:43:29.868 --> 05:43:29.878 align:start position:0%
all in one is I think some of the rules
 
05:43:31.910 --> 05:43:31.920 align:start position:0%
it's you know they'll they will look at
 
05:43:33.868 --> 05:43:33.878 align:start position:0%
it and when it comes to them regulating
 
05:43:35.150 --> 05:43:35.160 align:start position:0%
they understand what they need to do
 
05:43:36.350 --> 05:43:36.360 align:start position:0%
we've seen that successfully done with
 
05:43:38.670 --> 05:43:38.680 align:start position:0%
alcohol in many ways I know there's laws
 
05:43:40.310 --> 05:43:40.320 align:start position:0%
as well so they kind of compliment each
 
05:43:43.910 --> 05:43:43.920 align:start position:0%
other but the only some does anyone have
 
05:43:45.230 --> 05:43:45.240 align:start position:0%
a problem with that I mean I think when
 
05:43:47.110 --> 05:43:47.120 align:start position:0%
it comes to do you qualify for a
 
05:43:49.230 --> 05:43:49.240 align:start position:0%
therapeutic card and we keep track of
 
05:43:52.868 --> 05:43:52.878 align:start position:0%
it I think we I think we we G we give it
 
05:43:54.590 --> 05:43:54.600 align:start position:0%
to an agency that that has a proven
 
05:43:56.708 --> 05:43:56.718 align:start position:0%
track record of of doing things smoothly
 
05:43:59.750 --> 05:43:59.760 align:start position:0%
and correctly and regulating
 
05:44:02.548 --> 05:44:02.558 align:start position:0%
and and yeah maybe maybe we let the
 
05:44:04.948 --> 05:44:04.958 align:start position:0%
folks over at DHHS still hand out their
 
05:44:06.430 --> 05:44:06.440 align:start position:0%
little card but it's going to be less
 
05:44:08.590 --> 05:44:08.600 align:start position:0%
and less people getting a card you know
 
05:44:11.310 --> 05:44:11.320 align:start position:0%
it's already down from 20,000 to 13,000
 
05:44:13.868 --> 05:44:13.878 align:start position:0%
that's going to drop to like 5,000 so
 
05:44:16.830 --> 05:44:16.840 align:start position:0%
you know that'll go away too it it may
 
05:44:19.510 --> 05:44:19.520 align:start position:0%
be a time where that changes but I think
 
05:44:21.230 --> 05:44:21.240 align:start position:0%
to the in the
 
05:44:24.310 --> 05:44:24.320 align:start position:0%
interim is any so that just understand
 
05:44:26.830 --> 05:44:26.840 align:start position:0%
that from the the ATC perspective
 
05:44:30.548 --> 05:44:30.558 align:start position:0%
there's no objection to that
 
05:44:32.510 --> 05:44:32.520 align:start position:0%
um no objection
 
05:44:34.868 --> 05:44:34.878 align:start position:0%
what yeah we we'd love to see draft
 
05:44:36.510 --> 05:44:36.520 align:start position:0%
language to be able to say there's no
 
05:44:39.110 --> 05:44:39.120 align:start position:0%
objection uh but uh the concept the
 
05:44:41.590 --> 05:44:41.600 align:start position:0%
concept sounds agreeable as I'm
 
05:44:41.600 --> 05:44:47.150 align:start position:0%
concept sounds agreeable as I'm
understanding

05:44:47.150 --> 05:44:47.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:50.030 --> 05:44:50.040 align:start position:0%
it all right so I
 
05:44:52.230 --> 05:44:52.240 align:start position:0%
think for the commission perspective do
 
05:44:53.468 --> 05:44:53.478 align:start position:0%
we have any problem if anyone has a
 
05:44:56.070 --> 05:44:56.080 align:start position:0%
problem that ra just put your hand
 
05:44:56.080 --> 05:44:57.868 align:start position:0%
problem that ra just put your hand
up

05:44:57.868 --> 05:44:57.878 align:start position:0%
up
 
05:44:57.878 --> 05:44:59.990 align:start position:0%
up
no

05:44:59.990 --> 05:45:00.000 align:start position:0%
no
 
05:45:02.948 --> 05:45:02.958 align:start position:0%
going to be setting a limit for
 
05:45:05.670 --> 05:45:05.680 align:start position:0%
recreation and the therap beauty that's
 
05:45:07.910 --> 05:45:07.920 align:start position:0%
what the little card is for we have the
 
05:45:07.920 --> 05:45:11.468 align:start position:0%
what the little card is for we have the
good

05:45:11.468 --> 05:45:11.478 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:15.468 --> 05:45:15.478 align:start position:0%
stuff yeah and I and I think the idea
 
05:45:18.150 --> 05:45:18.160 align:start position:0%
was that any franchisee essentially
 
05:45:19.150 --> 05:45:19.160 align:start position:0%
would have the opportunity to
 
05:45:22.548 --> 05:45:22.558 align:start position:0%
potentially sell those not just one or
 
05:45:24.350 --> 05:45:24.360 align:start position:0%
seven they would have they would have to
 
05:45:27.430 --> 05:45:27.440 align:start position:0%
be able to know what the car does of
 
05:45:30.350 --> 05:45:30.360 align:start position:0%
otherwise qualified to be a
 
05:45:33.468 --> 05:45:33.478 align:start position:0%
manage uh store and distribute
 
05:45:36.910 --> 05:45:36.920 align:start position:0%
appropriately the higher concentration
 
05:45:38.548 --> 05:45:38.558 align:start position:0%
and right now there three manufacturers
 
05:45:40.750 --> 05:45:40.760 align:start position:0%
from these therapeutic grade is the term
 
05:45:42.910 --> 05:45:42.920 align:start position:0%
I I've been using they would only remain
 
05:45:49.788 --> 05:45:49.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:52.708 --> 05:45:52.718 align:start position:0%
essenti we know who manufactures that
 
05:45:57.070 --> 05:45:57.080 align:start position:0%
representative because we do so our next
 
05:45:59.548 --> 05:45:59.558 align:start position:0%
meeting is
 
05:46:02.708 --> 05:46:02.718 align:start position:0%
27th no it's going be the 23rd we have
 
05:46:03.868 --> 05:46:03.878 align:start position:0%
one in the
 
05:46:06.230 --> 05:46:06.240 align:start position:0%
23rd I actually left my uh physical
 
05:46:09.750 --> 05:46:09.760 align:start position:0%
Calendar home it's Tuesday of next week
 
05:46:12.390 --> 05:46:12.400 align:start position:0%
Tuesday next week
 
05:46:15.230 --> 05:46:15.240 align:start position:0%
yeah it's up actually actually no it's
 
05:46:18.190 --> 05:46:18.200 align:start position:0%
it's the 27th Monday the 27th Senator
 
05:46:20.670 --> 05:46:20.680 align:start position:0%
ambus next week you do I thought you
 
05:46:22.350 --> 05:46:22.360 align:start position:0%
were one of the few people in the
 
05:46:25.070 --> 05:46:25.080 align:start position:0%
earlier question on like the chief
 
05:46:28.788 --> 05:46:28.798 align:start position:0%
wanted a some type of nanogram for Miss
 
05:46:29.990 --> 05:46:30.000 align:start position:0%
inference I thought you were one of the
 
05:46:31.510 --> 05:46:31.520 align:start position:0%
few who didn't want that and I thought
 
05:46:34.750 --> 05:46:34.760 align:start position:0%
the majority did maybe not a specific
 
05:46:37.788 --> 05:46:37.798 align:start position:0%
number to theate but I I I would like to
 
05:46:40.150 --> 05:46:40.160 align:start position:0%
have something in the law the problem is
 
05:46:42.590 --> 05:46:42.600 align:start position:0%
I don't know what that something should
 
05:46:45.468 --> 05:46:45.478 align:start position:0%
be and I'm trying to figure out when you
 
05:46:47.150 --> 05:46:47.160 align:start position:0%
when we present if I was testifying for
 
05:46:48.468 --> 05:46:48.478 align:start position:0%
a committee trying to convince them to
 
05:46:52.070 --> 05:46:52.080 align:start position:0%
vote for it why would I pick two or five
 
05:46:54.230 --> 05:46:54.240 align:start position:0%
and I know you're right don't smoke and
 
05:46:58.070 --> 05:46:58.080 align:start position:0%
Dr well no no I'm so I'm undecided is my
 
05:46:59.910 --> 05:46:59.920 align:start position:0%
point so we got to be stricter than
 
05:47:02.548 --> 05:47:02.558 align:start position:0%
Colorado cuz they're they're uh they're
 
05:47:04.150 --> 05:47:04.160 align:start position:0%
fatal Rex is going crazy I'm going to do
 
05:47:06.230 --> 05:47:06.240 align:start position:0%
some my own research see I can I'm with
 
05:47:06.240 --> 05:47:06.990 align:start position:0%
some my own research see I can I'm with
you

05:47:06.990 --> 05:47:07.000 align:start position:0%
you
 
05:47:10.310 --> 05:47:10.320 align:start position:0%
though um all right so
 
05:47:13.788 --> 05:47:13.798 align:start position:0%
27th on the 27th what what will the
 
05:47:17.030 --> 05:47:17.040 align:start position:0%
agenda be I mean if this is already
 
05:47:19.310 --> 05:47:19.320 align:start position:0%
you've done the lining in and out so
 
05:47:22.468 --> 05:47:22.478 align:start position:0%
what's the plan well we got to we got to
 
05:47:24.510 --> 05:47:24.520 align:start position:0%
actually vote on a we got to put what we
 
05:47:27.430 --> 05:47:27.440 align:start position:0%
hope is a final product together now
 
05:47:29.310 --> 05:47:29.320 align:start position:0%
some of the final provision
 
05:47:31.430 --> 05:47:31.440 align:start position:0%
remember this is going to go before
 
05:47:33.510 --> 05:47:33.520 align:start position:0%
Commissions in the house I it's the
 
05:47:34.868 --> 05:47:34.878 align:start position:0%
Committees in the house in the S so this
 
05:47:37.390 --> 05:47:37.400 align:start position:0%
is not the bill it's Untouchable I
 
05:47:38.788 --> 05:47:38.798 align:start position:0%
understand that it's not even no one's
 
05:47:40.030 --> 05:47:40.040 align:start position:0%
even filed the
 
05:47:42.670 --> 05:47:42.680 align:start position:0%
legislation um but we want to make a
 
05:47:45.350 --> 05:47:45.360 align:start position:0%
recommendation on I think what a state
 
05:47:46.788 --> 05:47:46.798 align:start position:0%
control model would be so the issue of
 
05:47:50.230 --> 05:47:50.240 align:start position:0%
the nanograms the using uh smoking in
 
05:47:52.750 --> 05:47:52.760 align:start position:0%
public th those are serious issues but
 
05:47:54.750 --> 05:47:54.760 align:start position:0%
those are actually independent of the
 
05:47:56.430 --> 05:47:56.440 align:start position:0%
state run model I think it's important
 
05:47:59.390 --> 05:47:59.400 align:start position:0%
to have them all to do at once because
 
05:48:00.548 --> 05:48:00.558 align:start position:0%
you don't want to have one without the
 
05:48:02.788 --> 05:48:02.798 align:start position:0%
other but the finer details of whether
 
05:48:04.390 --> 05:48:04.400 align:start position:0%
it's a $5 fine
 
05:48:06.468 --> 05:48:06.478 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor the commission can make its
 
05:48:08.750 --> 05:48:08.760 align:start position:0%
recommendation without coming to a
 
05:48:11.430 --> 05:48:11.440 align:start position:0%
conclusion on that policy that could I
 
05:48:13.430 --> 05:48:13.440 align:start position:0%
ask a follow-up question on on the the
 
05:48:16.628 --> 05:48:16.638 align:start position:0%
report that we are mandated to write yes
 
05:48:19.270 --> 05:48:19.280 align:start position:0%
in 611
 
05:48:21.868 --> 05:48:21.878 align:start position:0%
um what is that going to look like are
 
05:48:24.948 --> 05:48:24.958 align:start position:0%
we just going to be taking the um the
 
05:48:27.150 --> 05:48:27.160 align:start position:0%
mark up that we've done and and will
 
05:48:29.150 --> 05:48:29.160 align:start position:0%
that comprise the report or we going to
 
05:48:31.430 --> 05:48:31.440 align:start position:0%
actually write a report every study
 
05:48:33.590 --> 05:48:33.600 align:start position:0%
commission I've ever served on you write
 
05:48:36.230 --> 05:48:36.240 align:start position:0%
a report majority and The Minority
 
05:48:38.270 --> 05:48:38.280 align:start position:0%
Report be a majority and a Minority
 
05:48:40.310 --> 05:48:40.320 align:start position:0%
Report but I would I Envision that if
 
05:48:43.350 --> 05:48:43.360 align:start position:0%
there is a majority that or has any
 
05:48:45.830 --> 05:48:45.840 align:start position:0%
proposed legislation and The Minority
 
05:48:47.788 --> 05:48:47.798 align:start position:0%
Report can have the same too you know
 
05:48:49.030 --> 05:48:49.040 align:start position:0%
like let's say you don't support this
 
05:48:50.510 --> 05:48:50.520 align:start position:0%
but there's you may want to highlight
 
05:48:52.310 --> 05:48:52.320 align:start position:0%
specific provisions of that attachment
 
05:48:54.910 --> 05:48:54.920 align:start position:0%
that you not only I oppose it I really
 
05:48:56.310 --> 05:48:56.320 align:start position:0%
really don't like this I double don't
 
05:48:59.190 --> 05:48:59.200 align:start position:0%
like that you can you can reference it
 
05:49:02.150 --> 05:49:02.160 align:start position:0%
the idea is to have something that's in
 
05:49:04.070 --> 05:49:04.080 align:start position:0%
place but I I'm going to try to focus
 
05:49:06.830 --> 05:49:06.840 align:start position:0%
really our debate on the state run model
 
05:49:09.830 --> 05:49:09.840 align:start position:0%
and again like so the smoking in public
 
05:49:12.350 --> 05:49:12.360 align:start position:0%
that is essentially whether it's the
 
05:49:14.990 --> 05:49:15.000 align:start position:0%
violation as written $100 fine
 
05:49:18.070 --> 05:49:18.080 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor doesn't impact the policy of
 
05:49:21.230 --> 05:49:21.240 align:start position:0%
the state controlled model right so when
 
05:49:23.868 --> 05:49:23.878 align:start position:0%
would you like The Minority Report uh
 
05:49:26.310 --> 05:49:26.320 align:start position:0%
submitted to you I I think we we
 
05:49:28.750 --> 05:49:28.760 align:start position:0%
submitted all at once am I correct it's
 
05:49:31.230 --> 05:49:31.240 align:start position:0%
just it's just add on is a majority
 
05:49:33.270 --> 05:49:33.280 align:start position:0%
report Minority
 
05:49:35.830 --> 05:49:35.840 align:start position:0%
Report we just had a contentious one
 
05:49:39.910 --> 05:49:39.920 align:start position:0%
with the worldwide re um um reporting on
 
05:49:43.150 --> 05:49:43.160 align:start position:0%
taxation reporting and what we did there
 
05:49:44.468 --> 05:49:44.478 align:start position:0%
was let the
 
05:49:48.030 --> 05:49:48.040 align:start position:0%
minority uh author write their thing and
 
05:49:51.030 --> 05:49:51.040 align:start position:0%
it was just attached as an appendix uh
 
05:49:53.750 --> 05:49:53.760 align:start position:0%
the minutes were attached as an appendix
 
05:49:54.830 --> 05:49:54.840 align:start position:0%
all of
 
05:49:57.708 --> 05:49:57.718 align:start position:0%
the material that was put down was
 
05:50:00.628 --> 05:50:00.638 align:start position:0%
listed as an appendix it wasn't included
 
05:50:02.390 --> 05:50:02.400 align:start position:0%
in the body of the report the body of
 
05:50:05.110 --> 05:50:05.120 align:start position:0%
the report was only five pages the the
 
05:50:07.670 --> 05:50:07.680 align:start position:0%
rest of the 46 Pages were all right
 
05:50:10.670 --> 05:50:10.680 align:start position:0%
bibliography and and The Minority Report
 
05:50:12.750 --> 05:50:12.760 align:start position:0%
The Minority Report was much larger than
 
05:50:14.070 --> 05:50:14.080 align:start position:0%
the majority
 
05:50:16.948 --> 05:50:16.958 align:start position:0%
report I have a feeling it that'll be
 
05:50:20.270 --> 05:50:20.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:25.548 --> 05:50:25.558 align:start position:0%
again well all right so on the 27th are
 
05:50:27.670 --> 05:50:27.680 align:start position:0%
we going to be able to we hopefully will
 
05:50:30.270 --> 05:50:30.280 align:start position:0%
have a a draft by
 
05:50:32.510 --> 05:50:32.520 align:start position:0%
then hopefully won't take us as long to
 
05:50:34.190 --> 05:50:34.200 align:start position:0%
go through it the only thing I will say
 
05:50:36.510 --> 05:50:36.520 align:start position:0%
is stuff about like smoking in public as
 
05:50:40.270 --> 05:50:40.280 align:start position:0%
much as I'm adamantly up against that
 
05:50:41.628 --> 05:50:41.638 align:start position:0%
this commission couldn't come to an
 
05:50:43.948 --> 05:50:43.958 align:start position:0%
agreement on that that is I think we can
 
05:50:47.430 --> 05:50:47.440 align:start position:0%
skip over those simply because that's
 
05:50:48.670 --> 05:50:48.680 align:start position:0%
not what this commission is charged to
 
05:50:50.110 --> 05:50:50.120 align:start position:0%
do I think it's important to go over it
 
05:50:52.628 --> 05:50:52.638 align:start position:0%
but we focus on the state run model side
 
05:50:55.468 --> 05:50:55.478 align:start position:0%
make sure that part is least
 
05:50:59.468 --> 05:50:59.478 align:start position:0%
operational does that sound good
 
05:51:02.510 --> 05:51:02.520 align:start position:0%
and if there is a updated draft you know
 
05:51:03.788 --> 05:51:03.798 align:start position:0%
it kind of incorporates everything that
 
05:51:06.990 --> 05:51:07.000 align:start position:0%
we've gone over um now keep in mind I'm
 
05:51:08.390 --> 05:51:08.400 align:start position:0%
going to be relying on my notes and if
 
05:51:09.590 --> 05:51:09.600 align:start position:0%
there's any problem with what's in there
 
05:51:10.750 --> 05:51:10.760 align:start position:0%
and you don't agree with it just please
 
05:51:13.230 --> 05:51:13.240 align:start position:0%
point it out but we'll
 
05:51:15.910 --> 05:51:15.920 align:start position:0%
um we'll I'll try to distribute that as
 
05:51:17.990 --> 05:51:18.000 align:start position:0%
early as possible when is our actual
 
05:51:18.000 --> 05:51:19.310 align:start position:0%
early as possible when is our actual
report

05:51:19.310 --> 05:51:19.320 align:start position:0%
report
 
05:51:22.590 --> 05:51:22.600 align:start position:0%
due December
 
05:51:26.150 --> 05:51:26.160 align:start position:0%
1st all right so if there's any changes
 
05:51:29.868 --> 05:51:29.878 align:start position:0%
needs to be made to that
 
05:51:32.708 --> 05:51:32.718 align:start position:0%
uh you know let's make let's be prepared
 
05:51:34.990 --> 05:51:35.000 align:start position:0%
to have that proposed change that day
 
05:51:37.628 --> 05:51:37.638 align:start position:0%
because we're not meeting again and and
 
05:51:39.070 --> 05:51:39.080 align:start position:0%
that's that and what what's going to be
 
05:51:40.468 --> 05:51:40.478 align:start position:0%
attached is you may want to have it in
 
05:51:43.468 --> 05:51:43.478 align:start position:0%
writing your change that you want me to
 
05:51:45.670 --> 05:51:45.680 align:start position:0%
it we have to incorp we have to vote on
 
05:51:47.310 --> 05:51:47.320 align:start position:0%
that incorporate in it would have to now
 
05:51:48.708 --> 05:51:48.718 align:start position:0%
be word for word it can't be something
 
05:51:51.310 --> 05:51:51.320 align:start position:0%
like we kind of hypothetically wrote up
 
05:51:54.548 --> 05:51:54.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:54.558 --> 05:51:56.350 align:start position:0%
 
that

05:51:56.350 --> 05:51:56.360 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:52:00.110 --> 05:52:00.120 align:start position:0%
um at the outset of of this um study
 
05:52:03.030 --> 05:52:03.040 align:start position:0%
commission uh we were asked to submit
 
05:52:03.040 --> 05:52:03.868 align:start position:0%
commission uh we were asked to submit
God

05:52:03.868 --> 05:52:03.878 align:start position:0%
God
 
05:52:06.910 --> 05:52:06.920 align:start position:0%
rails which I have done on on behalf of
 
05:52:08.510 --> 05:52:08.520 align:start position:0%
the prevention community and I know
 
05:52:10.670 --> 05:52:10.680 align:start position:0%
others have as well what is the going to
 
05:52:13.070 --> 05:52:13.080 align:start position:0%
be the process of integrating those God
 
05:52:17.350 --> 05:52:17.360 align:start position:0%
rails into the mockup that we've done so
 
05:52:20.150 --> 05:52:20.160 align:start position:0%
if we can if this commission agrees at
 
05:52:21.788 --> 05:52:21.798 align:start position:0%
least the majority can come to a
 
05:52:24.150 --> 05:52:24.160 align:start position:0%
consensus on a god rill I have no
 
05:52:26.670 --> 05:52:26.680 align:start position:0%
problem putting it into it it's when we
 
05:52:27.990 --> 05:52:28.000 align:start position:0%
when we're all over the place I think
 
05:52:30.430 --> 05:52:30.440 align:start position:0%
the smoking in public one no one likes
 
05:52:32.030 --> 05:52:32.040 align:start position:0%
what's in here no one liked any we
 
05:52:34.948 --> 05:52:34.958 align:start position:0%
couldn't agree on any any of the um
 
05:52:37.030 --> 05:52:37.040 align:start position:0%
proposals so I just left what's in there
 
05:52:39.150 --> 05:52:39.160 align:start position:0%
is what we can't come to an agreement
 
05:52:43.030 --> 05:52:43.040 align:start position:0%
it's what it is so I my point is the
 
05:52:44.708 --> 05:52:44.718 align:start position:0%
charge of the commission is to put
 
05:52:47.270 --> 05:52:47.280 align:start position:0%
together the state control model not
 
05:52:49.628 --> 05:52:49.638 align:start position:0%
necessarily make a recommendation on
 
05:52:52.190 --> 05:52:52.200 align:start position:0%
smoking or using in public I'm with you
 
05:52:53.948 --> 05:52:53.958 align:start position:0%
on the public use I think it's you
 
05:52:55.430 --> 05:52:55.440 align:start position:0%
intentionally violate the law you go out
 
05:52:57.030 --> 05:52:57.040 align:start position:0%
of your way to do it people say you
 
05:52:58.708 --> 05:52:58.718 align:start position:0%
don't have enough money to pay the fine
 
05:52:59.670 --> 05:52:59.680 align:start position:0%
guess what they but they just went to
 
05:53:01.948 --> 05:53:01.958 align:start position:0%
the store inv I don't know but that's
 
05:53:03.548 --> 05:53:03.558 align:start position:0%
what that's the argument but guess what
 
05:53:06.070 --> 05:53:06.080 align:start position:0%
we can't get a consensus so what to put
 
05:53:08.510 --> 05:53:08.520 align:start position:0%
in here I don't know the advisement to
 
05:53:12.270 --> 05:53:12.280 align:start position:0%
for the public to submit guard rails
 
05:53:14.510 --> 05:53:14.520 align:start position:0%
will be completely disregarded then
 
05:53:15.510 --> 05:53:15.520 align:start position:0%
that's what I'm hearing no that's that's
 
05:53:17.350 --> 05:53:17.360 align:start position:0%
not what I said that's what I heard no
 
05:53:19.150 --> 05:53:19.160 align:start position:0%
well that's not what I said what I'm
 
05:53:20.948 --> 05:53:20.958 align:start position:0%
saying is if the commission can come to
 
05:53:24.070 --> 05:53:24.080 align:start position:0%
a consensus on a guard room I have no
 
05:53:25.628 --> 05:53:25.638 align:start position:0%
problem incorporating that into the
 
05:53:28.190 --> 05:53:28.200 align:start position:0%
recommended legislation it's when we can
 
05:53:31.110 --> 05:53:31.120 align:start position:0%
can't come to a consensus that if we
 
05:53:32.948 --> 05:53:32.958 align:start position:0%
can't come to a consensus that's a
 
05:53:34.350 --> 05:53:34.360 align:start position:0%
provision that perhaps should be in The
 
05:53:37.430 --> 05:53:37.440 align:start position:0%
Minority Report but some of the guards I
 
05:53:39.510 --> 05:53:39.520 align:start position:0%
agree with you on but if the commission
 
05:53:42.468 --> 05:53:42.478 align:start position:0%
as a whole we can't come to a cons a
 
05:53:46.030 --> 05:53:46.040 align:start position:0%
consensus on in all fairness it's been
 
05:53:48.230 --> 05:53:48.240 align:start position:0%
months while since the whole commission
 
05:53:48.240 --> 05:53:49.548 align:start position:0%
months while since the whole commission
was

05:53:49.548 --> 05:53:49.558 align:start position:0%
was
 
05:53:52.350 --> 05:53:52.360 align:start position:0%
here that's why the the the voting will
 
05:53:54.830 --> 05:53:54.840 align:start position:0%
be done on the last day we kind of just
 
05:53:56.510 --> 05:53:56.520 align:start position:0%
got a consensus while we went going
 
05:54:00.070 --> 05:54:00.080 align:start position:0%
through it fast but
 
05:54:01.750 --> 05:54:01.760 align:start position:0%
I mean when you have a forum here and
 
05:54:04.190 --> 05:54:04.200 align:start position:0%
it's unanimous I assume that that's
 
05:54:07.948 --> 05:54:07.958 align:start position:0%
enough right even if people aren't
 
05:54:10.468 --> 05:54:10.478 align:start position:0%
here um thank you chairman will we be
 
05:54:12.788 --> 05:54:12.798 align:start position:0%
getting the report ahead of the 27th or
 
05:54:15.270 --> 05:54:15.280 align:start position:0%
will we have time to review
 
05:54:18.670 --> 05:54:18.680 align:start position:0%
it and before we're able to vote on it I
 
05:54:21.230 --> 05:54:21.240 align:start position:0%
guess the question is
 
05:54:24.548 --> 05:54:24.558 align:start position:0%
we well the report should be available
 
05:54:25.510 --> 05:54:25.520 align:start position:0%
how long you think it would take to put
 
05:54:27.070 --> 05:54:27.080 align:start position:0%
the report
 
05:54:27.080 --> 05:54:33.590 align:start position:0%
the report
together

05:54:33.590 --> 05:54:33.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:35.830 --> 05:54:35.840 align:start position:0%
so someone everyone can sign sign off on
 
05:54:46.788 --> 05:54:46.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:51.030 --> 05:54:51.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:53.628 --> 05:54:53.638 align:start position:0%
23r are we meeting on the 23rd is that
 
05:55:00.030 --> 05:55:00.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:02.390 --> 05:55:02.400 align:start position:0%
you already had your friends giving so
 
05:55:04.070 --> 05:55:04.080 align:start position:0%
you don't need thanks thank you senator
 
05:55:06.468 --> 05:55:06.478 align:start position:0%
for attending you're welcome all right
 
05:55:11.310 --> 05:55:11.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:13.788 --> 05:55:13.798 align:start position:0%
um report wise I don't know I don't know
 
05:55:16.510 --> 05:55:16.520 align:start position:0%
if that's to be able to be ready but I
 
05:55:18.750 --> 05:55:18.760 align:start position:0%
think in order to put something together
 
05:55:20.390 --> 05:55:20.400 align:start position:0%
I don't think it can be done by the 27th
 
05:55:22.430 --> 05:55:22.440 align:start position:0%
but maybe we got to be prepared to be
 
05:55:25.350 --> 05:55:25.360 align:start position:0%
here till 3 o'
 
05:55:27.990 --> 05:55:28.000 align:start position:0%
again if that's all right with everyone
 
05:55:29.670 --> 05:55:29.680 align:start position:0%
I just want to uh I'm going to be out of
 
05:55:32.070 --> 05:55:32.080 align:start position:0%
state on the 27th so um former
 
05:55:34.310 --> 05:55:34.320 align:start position:0%
representative suola will be here
 
05:55:37.590 --> 05:55:37.600 align:start position:0%
sitting in my in my seat I have I have a
 
05:55:39.190 --> 05:55:39.200 align:start position:0%
good uh idea which which direction
 
05:55:42.270 --> 05:55:42.280 align:start position:0%
you're go yes
 
05:55:45.190 --> 05:55:45.200 align:start position:0%
so I don't support proxy voting but if I

anyone everyone good all
 
05:56:26.868 --> 05:56:26.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:26.878 --> 05:56:36.150 align:start position:0%
 
hold

05:56:36.150 --> 05:56:36.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:37.350 --> 05:56:37.360 align:start position:0%
thanks for the opportunity my name is
 
05:56:38.670 --> 05:56:38.680 align:start position:0%
Michael Holt I'm the administrator of
 
05:56:40.548 --> 05:56:40.558 align:start position:0%
the therapeutic cannabis program I just
 
05:56:42.510 --> 05:56:42.520 align:start position:0%
wanted to follow up on one point with
 
05:56:44.708 --> 05:56:44.718 align:start position:0%
regard to the direction that uh was
 
05:56:47.230 --> 05:56:47.240 align:start position:0%
discussed with uh regard to moving part
 
05:56:48.990 --> 05:56:49.000 align:start position:0%
of the therapeutic cannabis program that
 
05:56:52.150 --> 05:56:52.160 align:start position:0%
is the regulation of the atc's from thhs
 
05:56:54.110 --> 05:56:54.120 align:start position:0%
to The Liquor Commission um I would ask
 
05:56:56.350 --> 05:56:56.360 align:start position:0%
the commission to consider if they do do
 
05:56:58.708 --> 05:56:58.718 align:start position:0%
that that the at CES that the
 
05:57:01.030 --> 05:57:01.040 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis program is funded
 
05:57:04.468 --> 05:57:04.478 align:start position:0%
by ATC licensing fees so if that were to
 
05:57:08.110 --> 05:57:08.120 align:start position:0%
move from HHS to Liquor Commission we
 
05:57:10.350 --> 05:57:10.360 align:start position:0%
would lose a source of our funding and
 
05:57:12.270 --> 05:57:12.280 align:start position:0%
so what that means is that we would need
 
05:57:15.230 --> 05:57:15.240 align:start position:0%
a separate source of funding to fund our
 
05:57:17.670 --> 05:57:17.680 align:start position:0%
program but is isn't the program now
 
05:57:18.948 --> 05:57:18.958 align:start position:0%
moved under
 
05:57:22.190 --> 05:57:22.200 align:start position:0%
liquor As I understood the conversation
 
05:57:26.110 --> 05:57:26.120 align:start position:0%
the regulatory Authority uh for the ATC
 
05:57:28.510 --> 05:57:28.520 align:start position:0%
licensing would be moved D but the
 
05:57:31.670 --> 05:57:31.680 align:start position:0%
registry card um aspect of the program
 
05:57:33.750 --> 05:57:33.760 align:start position:0%
the the patient registry would remain
 
05:57:36.030 --> 05:57:36.040 align:start position:0%
with DHHS so we would still need funding
 
05:57:39.110 --> 05:57:39.120 align:start position:0%
for uh the registry um program if you
 
05:57:42.390 --> 05:57:42.400 align:start position:0%
will if we were if the ATC funding uh
 
05:57:43.548 --> 05:57:43.558 align:start position:0%
part of the program was to move to
 
05:57:45.910 --> 05:57:45.920 align:start position:0%
liquor so we need we would need an
 
05:57:48.910 --> 05:57:48.920 align:start position:0%
appropriation um to uh continue to fund
 
05:57:51.628 --> 05:57:51.638 align:start position:0%
the uh the patient registry if we lost
 
05:57:56.708 --> 05:57:56.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:56.718 --> 05:58:00.750 align:start position:0%
 
atcs

05:58:00.750 --> 05:58:00.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:04.430 --> 05:58:04.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:08.390 --> 05:58:08.400 align:start position:0%
that see no thank you Mr thank
 
05:58:10.830 --> 05:58:10.840 align:start position:0%
