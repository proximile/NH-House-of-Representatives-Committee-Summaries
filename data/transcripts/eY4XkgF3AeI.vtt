suicide
 
00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 align:start position:0%
um this was a bill that has
 
00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 align:start position:0%
we've been working on i chaired the
 
00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 align:start position:0%
commission on
 
00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:29.749 align:start position:0%
commission on
[Music]

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 align:start position:0%
ptsd in first responders
 
00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 align:start position:0%
this is one that we had worked on last
 
00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:38.479 align:start position:0%
year this is one of the topics we had
 
00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:39.680 align:start position:0%
worked with
 
00:01:42.069 --> 00:01:42.079 align:start position:0%
some of the first responders last year
 
00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:45.680 align:start position:0%
and this bill is primarily a result of
 
00:01:48.069 --> 00:01:48.079 align:start position:0%
that commission
 
00:01:52.389 --> 00:01:52.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:55.520 align:start position:0%
the amount of money that would
 
00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 align:start position:0%
would be spent is um to me not a lot
 
00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:00.880 align:start position:0%
when you consider the lives of
 
00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:02.560 align:start position:0%
our first responders
 
00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 align:start position:0%

bill sb227fn
uh

00:03:38.149 --> 00:03:38.159 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:40.720 align:start position:0%
very briefly both research and clinical
 
00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:42.400 align:start position:0%
experience dictate
 
00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:44.400 align:start position:0%
the fact that there is a definite nexus
 
00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:46.640 align:start position:0%
between and among the stress crisis and
 
00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:48.560 align:start position:0%
trauma that all first responders
 
00:03:51.589 --> 00:03:51.599 align:start position:0%
experience and the suicide among our
 
00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:53.120 align:start position:0%
brothers and sisters
 
00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:54.640 align:start position:0%
at present in law enforcement for
 
00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:55.830 align:start position:0%
at present in law enforcement for
example

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:55.840 align:start position:0%
example
 
00:03:58.070 --> 00:03:58.080 align:start position:0%
we estimate a one to four and a half
 
00:04:00.309 --> 00:04:00.319 align:start position:0%
ratio of line of duty deaths to suicidal
 
00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:02.560 align:start position:0%
deaths in police work in other words for
 
00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:04.720 align:start position:0%
every one line of duty death and police
 
00:04:06.149 --> 00:04:06.159 align:start position:0%
work there's at least four and a half
 
00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:08.480 align:start position:0%
and i'm not sure how we uh rationalize
 
00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:10.640 align:start position:0%
the half but there's at least 4.5 police
 
00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:14.720 align:start position:0%
officers that will die by their own hand
 
00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:18.000 align:start position:0%
there is a lack of
 
00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:20.400 align:start position:0%
analog in other professions for this
 
00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:22.000 align:start position:0%
it's important to note
 
00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:26.000 align:start position:0%
that we are unaware of any suicide
 
00:04:27.189 --> 00:04:27.199 align:start position:0%
and i am
 
00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:29.040 align:start position:0%
being uh involved in this work for over
 
00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:31.680 align:start position:0%
40 years i'm unaware of any suicide
 
00:04:33.749 --> 00:04:33.759 align:start position:0%
among any first responder
 
00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:35.600 align:start position:0%
as a cash incentive to kill him or
 
00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:36.629 align:start position:0%
as a cash incentive to kill him or
herself

00:04:36.629 --> 00:04:36.639 align:start position:0%
herself
 
00:04:38.629 --> 00:04:38.639 align:start position:0%
i understand that this is a fiscal note
 
00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:40.720 align:start position:0%
we don't have an amount we hope that we
 
00:04:42.469 --> 00:04:42.479 align:start position:0%
never will have an amount
 
00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:44.560 align:start position:0%
but should we we feel that this is the
 
00:04:46.629 --> 00:04:46.639 align:start position:0%
right thing to do for the survivors of
 
00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:50.160 align:start position:0%
anyone uh who does uh kill themselves as
 
00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:51.510 align:start position:0%
anyone uh who does uh kill themselves as
a

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:51.520 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:53.520 align:start position:0%

excuse me
 
00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:27.440 align:start position:0%
you have to speak into the microphone
 
00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:30.160 align:start position:0%
because it is being um
 
00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:32.000 align:start position:0%

for this bill
 
00:05:42.469 --> 00:05:42.479 align:start position:0%
unequivocally we hope that we will never
 
00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:45.120 align:start position:0%
have to substantiate a cost to the state
 
00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:47.440 align:start position:0%
the first responder community to include
 
00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:48.720 align:start position:0%
corrections officers are working
 
00:05:50.629 --> 00:05:50.639 align:start position:0%
diligently day in and day out
 
00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:52.080 align:start position:0%
to make sure that we're providing our
 
00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:53.280 align:start position:0%
personnel with the training and
 
00:05:54.629 --> 00:05:54.639 align:start position:0%
resources available to be able to
 
00:05:56.309 --> 00:05:56.319 align:start position:0%
mitigate this concern
 
00:05:58.870 --> 00:05:58.880 align:start position:0%
but as a culture and as a state we are
 
00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:00.240 align:start position:0%
playing catch-up
 
00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:01.680 align:start position:0%
we have to do a better job of making
 
00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:03.360 align:start position:0%
sure that we are taking care of those
 
00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:05.360 align:start position:0%
who take care of others and this is a
 
00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:07.280 align:start position:0%
very important first step
 
00:06:08.629 --> 00:06:08.639 align:start position:0%

he'll take care of it thank you
representative

00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:47.120 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:06:49.189 --> 00:06:49.199 align:start position:0%
okay thank you madam chairman uh chief
 
00:06:51.029 --> 00:06:51.039 align:start position:0%
ghosting a question for you you
 
00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:53.120 align:start position:0%
mentioned a ratio of one to four four
 
00:06:54.469 --> 00:06:54.479 align:start position:0%
and a half
 
00:06:55.749 --> 00:06:55.759 align:start position:0%
this uh
 
00:06:57.909 --> 00:06:57.919 align:start position:0%
the numbers you gave us are for people
 
00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:00.880 align:start position:0%
who are actively on duty
 
00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:03.440 align:start position:0%
is there a ratio when people are retired
 
00:07:06.230 --> 00:07:06.240 align:start position:0%
because the reason i ask that is for the
 
00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:08.160 align:start position:0%
va for example
 
00:07:11.350 --> 00:07:11.360 align:start position:0%
as time progresses as veterans age it
 
00:07:14.390 --> 00:07:14.400 align:start position:0%
becomes more of an issue
 
00:07:16.710 --> 00:07:16.720 align:start position:0%
i wish that they were representative the
 
00:07:19.510 --> 00:07:19.520 align:start position:0%
sad thing is that we do not know what's
 
00:07:21.909 --> 00:07:21.919 align:start position:0%
happening among our uh retired
 
00:07:24.309 --> 00:07:24.319 align:start position:0%
individuals other than through anecdote
 
00:07:26.150 --> 00:07:26.160 align:start position:0%
uh there's actually very little research
 
00:07:29.350 --> 00:07:29.360 align:start position:0%
in the area uh there's there may be some
 
00:07:32.230 --> 00:07:32.240 align:start position:0%
clinical uh information available to us
 
00:07:34.150 --> 00:07:34.160 align:start position:0%
but on a death certificate it doesn't
 
00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:34.950 align:start position:0%
but on a death certificate it doesn't
say

00:07:34.950 --> 00:07:34.960 align:start position:0%
say
 
00:07:37.350 --> 00:07:37.360 align:start position:0%
died by suicide because he was a cop so
 
00:07:40.950 --> 00:07:40.960 align:start position:0%
to speak uh and we don't know we suspect
 
00:07:42.830 --> 00:07:42.840 align:start position:0%
it's a very large number
 
00:07:45.430 --> 00:07:45.440 align:start position:0%
um but again i can't give you a
 
00:07:47.350 --> 00:07:47.360 align:start position:0%
definitive answer i wish i could okay
 
00:07:50.070 --> 00:07:50.080 align:start position:0%
thank you chief you're welcome
 
00:07:52.869 --> 00:07:52.879 align:start position:0%
are there any further questions
 
00:07:55.110 --> 00:07:55.120 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much i
 
00:07:57.110 --> 00:07:57.120 align:start position:0%
appreciate your testimony thank you
 
00:08:00.250 --> 00:08:00.260 align:start position:0%
thank you can i keep the dog
 
00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:04.150 align:start position:0%
thank you can i keep the dog
[Laughter]

00:08:04.150 --> 00:08:04.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:17.430 --> 00:08:17.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:19.029 --> 00:08:19.039 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you members
 
00:08:20.390 --> 00:08:20.400 align:start position:0%
of finance
 
00:08:23.430 --> 00:08:23.440 align:start position:0%
for allowing me to speak
 
00:08:25.029 --> 00:08:25.039 align:start position:0%
in front of you today
 
00:08:28.550 --> 00:08:28.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:30.629 --> 00:08:30.639 align:start position:0%
very personal bill for me and i'll get
 
00:08:31.909 --> 00:08:31.919 align:start position:0%
into a little bit as
 
00:08:34.070 --> 00:08:34.080 align:start position:0%
briefly as to why that is
 
00:08:36.550 --> 00:08:36.560 align:start position:0%
um along with senator bertel i also sit
 
00:08:37.589 --> 00:08:37.599 align:start position:0%
on the state's
 
00:08:37.599 --> 00:08:38.829 align:start position:0%
on the state's
ptsd

00:08:38.829 --> 00:08:38.839 align:start position:0%
ptsd
 
00:08:41.190 --> 00:08:41.200 align:start position:0%
commission and we have been working
 
00:08:43.829 --> 00:08:43.839 align:start position:0%
diligently every month
 
00:08:50.630 --> 00:08:50.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:52.870 --> 00:08:52.880 align:start position:0%
the reason that this bill in particular
 
00:08:55.670 --> 00:08:55.680 align:start position:0%
is so personal to me is that i have two
 
00:08:57.190 --> 00:08:57.200 align:start position:0%
working partners that have committed
 
00:08:57.200 --> 00:08:59.190 align:start position:0%
working partners that have committed
suicide

00:08:59.190 --> 00:08:59.200 align:start position:0%
suicide
 
00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:00.389 align:start position:0%
suicide
now

00:09:00.389 --> 00:09:00.399 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:09:02.070 --> 00:09:02.080 align:start position:0%
working partners right so i've been in
 
00:09:04.070 --> 00:09:04.080 align:start position:0%
the fire service for 27 years i've been
 
00:09:06.150 --> 00:09:06.160 align:start position:0%
a manchester fire lieutenant and been on
 
00:09:08.790 --> 00:09:08.800 align:start position:0%
manchester fire for the last 18 years
 
00:09:10.710 --> 00:09:10.720 align:start position:0%
i've also served in the town of raymond
 
00:09:12.710 --> 00:09:12.720 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire
 
00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:14.470 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire
and

00:09:14.470 --> 00:09:14.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:16.710 align:start position:0%
and
the

00:09:16.710 --> 00:09:16.720 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:09:20.150 --> 00:09:20.160 align:start position:0%
the rarity of the these events
 
00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:21.590 align:start position:0%
the rarity of the these events
are

00:09:21.590 --> 00:09:21.600 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:09:23.269 --> 00:09:23.279 align:start position:0%
thank god they are as rare as they are
 
00:09:25.509 --> 00:09:25.519 align:start position:0%
but to have two working partners go
 
00:09:27.670 --> 00:09:27.680 align:start position:0%
through this is it's unusual for someone
 
00:09:29.670 --> 00:09:29.680 align:start position:0%
to have one that that did it much less
 
00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:30.710 align:start position:0%
to have one that that did it much less
too

00:09:30.710 --> 00:09:30.720 align:start position:0%
too
 
00:09:31.660 --> 00:09:31.670 align:start position:0%
um they were for
 
00:09:31.670 --> 00:09:32.949 align:start position:0%
um they were for
[Music]

00:09:32.949 --> 00:09:32.959 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:09:34.550 --> 00:09:34.560 align:start position:0%
certainly different reasons different
 
00:09:37.590 --> 00:09:37.600 align:start position:0%
background situations but
 
00:09:40.070 --> 00:09:40.080 align:start position:0%
one of the things that
 
00:09:41.670 --> 00:09:41.680 align:start position:0%
unfortunately is
 
00:09:43.509 --> 00:09:43.519 align:start position:0%
is difficult in the first responder
 
00:09:45.350 --> 00:09:45.360 align:start position:0%
world as with a lot of things that's
 
00:09:47.430 --> 00:09:47.440 align:start position:0%
cumulative so
 
00:09:49.829 --> 00:09:49.839 align:start position:0%
you have horrific situations that occur
 
00:09:49.839 --> 00:09:51.829 align:start position:0%
you have horrific situations that occur
and

00:09:51.829 --> 00:09:51.839 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:09:53.190 --> 00:09:53.200 align:start position:0%
you know everyone handles those
 
00:09:54.550 --> 00:09:54.560 align:start position:0%
differently and and you can have
 
00:09:56.550 --> 00:09:56.560 align:start position:0%
situations over your career that
 
00:09:58.710 --> 00:09:58.720 align:start position:0%
happened a decade ago and all of a
 
00:10:01.190 --> 00:10:01.200 align:start position:0%
sudden they just pop up
 
00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:02.470 align:start position:0%
sudden they just pop up
so

00:10:02.470 --> 00:10:02.480 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:10:04.389 --> 00:10:04.399 align:start position:0%
you know this this is not always just a
 
00:10:06.550 --> 00:10:06.560 align:start position:0%
simple causal relationship in the sense
 
00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:07.590 align:start position:0%
simple causal relationship in the sense
of

00:10:07.590 --> 00:10:07.600 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:10:09.110 --> 00:10:09.120 align:start position:0%
x happened
 
00:10:10.470 --> 00:10:10.480 align:start position:0%
y occurred
 
00:10:13.430 --> 00:10:13.440 align:start position:0%
and z was the end result it
 
00:10:17.269 --> 00:10:17.279 align:start position:0%
it it almost never works out that way so
 
00:10:20.069 --> 00:10:20.079 align:start position:0%
um you know one of the things that
 
00:10:21.590 --> 00:10:21.600 align:start position:0%
as you are a
 
00:10:23.350 --> 00:10:23.360 align:start position:0%
the finance committee
 
00:10:25.269 --> 00:10:25.279 align:start position:0%
you know we do have a peculiar fiscal
 
00:10:27.110 --> 00:10:27.120 align:start position:0%
note here
 
00:10:28.389 --> 00:10:28.399 align:start position:0%
in that
 
00:10:30.069 --> 00:10:30.079 align:start position:0%
hopefully nothing ever happens and we
 
00:10:30.079 --> 00:10:30.790 align:start position:0%
hopefully nothing ever happens and we
pay

00:10:30.790 --> 00:10:30.800 align:start position:0%
pay
 
00:10:33.110 --> 00:10:33.120 align:start position:0%
zero dollars but the reality is that's
 
00:10:34.949 --> 00:10:34.959 align:start position:0%
probably not the case and
 
00:10:37.110 --> 00:10:37.120 align:start position:0%
you know we really should look at at the
 
00:10:39.750 --> 00:10:39.760 align:start position:0%
holistic situation here with that
 
00:10:41.110 --> 00:10:41.120 align:start position:0%
a hundred thousand dollar line of duty
 
00:10:44.069 --> 00:10:44.079 align:start position:0%
death benefit in this particular case
 
00:10:45.750 --> 00:10:45.760 align:start position:0%
is relatively peanuts considering that
 
00:10:47.110 --> 00:10:47.120 align:start position:0%
all of the folks that are involved in
 
00:10:48.870 --> 00:10:48.880 align:start position:0%
this are in the penn state pension
 
00:10:48.880 --> 00:10:50.230 align:start position:0%
this are in the penn state pension
system

00:10:50.230 --> 00:10:50.240 align:start position:0%
system
 
00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:51.110 align:start position:0%
system
and

00:10:51.110 --> 00:10:51.120 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:10:53.030 --> 00:10:53.040 align:start position:0%
having been on edna for a couple of
 
00:10:55.430 --> 00:10:55.440 align:start position:0%
terms and and having that is
 
00:10:56.790 --> 00:10:56.800 align:start position:0%
kind of our
 
00:10:58.150 --> 00:10:58.160 align:start position:0%
one of the major things that we we
 
00:11:00.710 --> 00:11:00.720 align:start position:0%
tackle in edna i can tell you that
 
00:11:02.069 --> 00:11:02.079 align:start position:0%
without getting into any of the math and
 
00:11:04.069 --> 00:11:04.079 align:start position:0%
the formulas and the weeds of this
 
00:11:06.790 --> 00:11:06.800 align:start position:0%
that for the family of the person that
 
00:11:08.949 --> 00:11:08.959 align:start position:0%
goes through this this is a substantial
 
00:11:10.710 --> 00:11:10.720 align:start position:0%
financial loss to them
 
00:11:12.310 --> 00:11:12.320 align:start position:0%
to lose someone who's in the state
 
00:11:13.910 --> 00:11:13.920 align:start position:0%
pension system that commits suicide
 
00:11:15.910 --> 00:11:15.920 align:start position:0%
because this has long-term
 
00:11:17.430 --> 00:11:17.440 align:start position:0%
ramifications the way the pension's
 
00:11:19.990 --> 00:11:20.000 align:start position:0%
adjusted for survivors and i'm i know
 
00:11:21.190 --> 00:11:21.200 align:start position:0%
that was mentioned by the the two
 
00:11:22.870 --> 00:11:22.880 align:start position:0%
gentlemen that were here prior and i
 
00:11:24.310 --> 00:11:24.320 align:start position:0%
really do want to harp on that in the
 
00:11:27.350 --> 00:11:27.360 align:start position:0%
fact that there really truly is zero
 
00:11:29.990 --> 00:11:30.000 align:start position:0%
financial incentive for this it's really
 
00:11:31.670 --> 00:11:31.680 align:start position:0%
a financial train wreck for those that
 
00:11:34.949 --> 00:11:34.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:37.590 --> 00:11:37.600 align:start position:0%
so you know not not getting into the too
 
00:11:39.269 --> 00:11:39.279 align:start position:0%
much of the policy i just like i said
 
00:11:40.630 --> 00:11:40.640 align:start position:0%
with you being financed i really do want
 
00:11:43.430 --> 00:11:43.440 align:start position:0%
to harp on that
 
00:11:44.870 --> 00:11:44.880 align:start position:0%
but i also do want to plug the
 
00:11:47.030 --> 00:11:47.040 align:start position:0%
commission a little bit further here in
 
00:11:49.190 --> 00:11:49.200 align:start position:0%
the sense that all of the aspects of
 
00:11:50.710 --> 00:11:50.720 align:start position:0%
this have been looked at by the
 
00:11:52.790 --> 00:11:52.800 align:start position:0%
commission we've we've dived into this
 
00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:53.910 align:start position:0%
commission we've we've dived into this
in

00:11:53.910 --> 00:11:53.920 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:11:55.350 --> 00:11:55.360 align:start position:0%
from angles that i didn't even think
 
00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:58.069 align:start position:0%
from angles that i didn't even think
were

00:11:58.069 --> 00:11:58.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:00.949 --> 00:12:00.959 align:start position:0%
were part of this and having a group
 
00:12:03.110 --> 00:12:03.120 align:start position:0%
that is made up of folks from everything
 
00:12:05.670 --> 00:12:05.680 align:start position:0%
from the insurance carriers to health
 
00:12:06.870 --> 00:12:06.880 align:start position:0%
care to
 
00:12:06.880 --> 00:12:08.150 align:start position:0%
care to
social

00:12:08.150 --> 00:12:08.160 align:start position:0%
social
 
00:12:10.629 --> 00:12:10.639 align:start position:0%
certainly the legislative side of this
 
00:12:11.670 --> 00:12:11.680 align:start position:0%
you know we've
 
00:12:13.350 --> 00:12:13.360 align:start position:0%
we've looked at this from from many
 
00:12:15.509 --> 00:12:15.519 align:start position:0%
different angles and it really truly is
 
00:12:19.430 --> 00:12:19.440 align:start position:0%
a very complex situation so
 
00:12:21.030 --> 00:12:21.040 align:start position:0%
you know that's that's something the
 
00:12:22.629 --> 00:12:22.639 align:start position:0%
commission is really handling and you

called the scenes of catastrophic

of these exposures over time
 
00:14:25.750 --> 00:14:25.760 align:start position:0%
may result in psychological injuries and

even suicide
 
00:14:29.189 --> 00:14:29.199 align:start position:0%

disorder
 
00:14:35.590 --> 00:14:35.600 align:start position:0%
oftentimes this results in an increase
 
00:14:37.350 --> 00:14:37.360 align:start position:0%
in harmful behaviors
 
00:14:39.590 --> 00:14:39.600 align:start position:0%

suicide
 
00:14:43.990 --> 00:14:44.000 align:start position:0%
we face the harsh reality that despite
 
00:14:45.509 --> 00:14:45.519 align:start position:0%
our best efforts at awareness and
 
00:14:47.750 --> 00:14:47.760 align:start position:0%
prevention our desk
 
00:14:49.189 --> 00:14:49.199 align:start position:0%
or despite our attempts to provide a
 
00:14:51.110 --> 00:14:51.120 align:start position:0%
listening ear or helping hand or a
 
00:14:53.110 --> 00:14:53.120 align:start position:0%
shoulder to cry on there are simply more
 
00:14:55.670 --> 00:14:55.680 align:start position:0%
instances where we are unable to
 
00:14:58.150 --> 00:14:58.160 align:start position:0%
make the save of our own members
 
00:14:59.509 --> 00:14:59.519 align:start position:0%
it is in these instances that our
 
00:15:00.949 --> 00:15:00.959 align:start position:0%
responsibility then turns to the
 
00:15:03.189 --> 00:15:03.199 align:start position:0%
families of the loved ones
 
00:15:04.710 --> 00:15:04.720 align:start position:0%
these are the families who have left who
 
00:15:06.230 --> 00:15:06.240 align:start position:0%
are left in the wake of a disaster that
 
00:15:08.389 --> 00:15:08.399 align:start position:0%
is so unimaginable that it turns their
 
00:15:10.550 --> 00:15:10.560 align:start position:0%
lives upside down
 
00:15:11.590 --> 00:15:11.600 align:start position:0%
they are mourning the loss of their
 
00:15:13.509 --> 00:15:13.519 align:start position:0%
loved one while also wondering how they
 
00:15:15.030 --> 00:15:15.040 align:start position:0%
will pay the mortgage or put food on
 
00:15:16.550 --> 00:15:16.560 align:start position:0%
their table
 
00:15:17.910 --> 00:15:17.920 align:start position:0%
these are the very same families who
 
00:15:19.189 --> 00:15:19.199 align:start position:0%
supported their loved one throughout the
 
00:15:22.069 --> 00:15:22.079 align:start position:0%
many nights weekends holidays that they
 
00:15:23.990 --> 00:15:24.000 align:start position:0%
worked away from home many times 24 to
 
00:15:26.230 --> 00:15:26.240 align:start position:0%
48 hours straight
 
00:15:27.590 --> 00:15:27.600 align:start position:0%
these are the very same families who
 
00:15:28.949 --> 00:15:28.959 align:start position:0%
laid awake at night wondering if their
 
00:15:30.470 --> 00:15:30.480 align:start position:0%
loved one would make it home from their
 
00:15:32.150 --> 00:15:32.160 align:start position:0%
last shift
 
00:15:34.230 --> 00:15:34.240 align:start position:0%
and these are the same the the very same
 
00:15:35.509 --> 00:15:35.519 align:start position:0%
families who watched their loved one
 
00:15:37.030 --> 00:15:37.040 align:start position:0%
grow distant and detached as they
 
00:15:38.230 --> 00:15:38.240 align:start position:0%
silently fought their battle with
 
00:15:40.710 --> 00:15:40.720 align:start position:0%
depression or ptsd
 
00:15:42.310 --> 00:15:42.320 align:start position:0%
we owe it to these families to help
 
00:15:44.710 --> 00:15:44.720 align:start position:0%
provide some level of dignity and relief
 
00:15:45.990 --> 00:15:46.000 align:start position:0%
in their life
 
00:15:47.110 --> 00:15:47.120 align:start position:0%
and while it won't bring their loved
 
00:15:49.030 --> 00:15:49.040 align:start position:0%
ones back it will help to ensure their
 
00:15:52.069 --> 00:15:52.079 align:start position:0%
families can begin to heal
 
00:15:53.189 --> 00:15:53.199 align:start position:0%
the leaders of the professional
 
00:15:54.470 --> 00:15:54.480 align:start position:0%

behavioral health and to do whatever we
 
00:16:01.910 --> 00:16:01.920 align:start position:0%
can to help prevent any further loss of
 
00:16:04.550 --> 00:16:04.560 align:start position:0%
life of this devastating illness

firsthand what it

is like inside one of our facilities but
 
00:17:19.990 --> 00:17:20.000 align:start position:0%
what you don't understand is that

what you don't understand is that
day-to-day

00:17:21.990 --> 00:17:22.000 align:start position:0%
day-to-day
 
00:17:24.549 --> 00:17:24.559 align:start position:0%
role that our corrections officers and

our corrections line staff play in those
 
00:17:29.830 --> 00:17:29.840 align:start position:0%
facilities where we have for example in
 
00:17:31.830 --> 00:17:31.840 align:start position:0%
our men's facility
 
00:17:33.350 --> 00:17:33.360 align:start position:0%
gang wars
 
00:17:34.789 --> 00:17:34.799 align:start position:0%
we have
 
00:17:37.190 --> 00:17:37.200 align:start position:0%
what we call the security threat groups
 
00:17:38.390 --> 00:17:38.400 align:start position:0%
or gangs
 
00:17:41.029 --> 00:17:41.039 align:start position:0%
that um try to bring contraband into the
 
00:17:43.669 --> 00:17:43.679 align:start position:0%
facilities that contraband being drugs
 
00:17:44.950 --> 00:17:44.960 align:start position:0%
and there's
 
00:17:47.510 --> 00:17:47.520 align:start position:0%
wars over who is going to make the most

00:17:54.630 --> 00:17:54.640 align:start position:0%
our corrections officers have to deal
 
00:17:56.870 --> 00:17:56.880 align:start position:0%

occur in the facility on a daily basis
 
00:18:02.470 --> 00:18:02.480 align:start position:0%
one of the things that
 
00:18:05.590 --> 00:18:05.600 align:start position:0%
that we see in the corrections field is
 
00:18:07.590 --> 00:18:07.600 align:start position:0%
and studies have shown and the testimony
 
00:18:10.070 --> 00:18:10.080 align:start position:0%
that i've just handed out to you has
 
00:18:12.789 --> 00:18:12.799 align:start position:0%
links to some of the this testimony or
 
00:18:15.270 --> 00:18:15.280 align:start position:0%
the studies that have been done
 
00:18:17.990 --> 00:18:18.000 align:start position:0%
show that corrections officers have a
 
00:18:20.630 --> 00:18:20.640 align:start position:0%
higher rate or higher incidence of
 
00:18:23.510 --> 00:18:23.520 align:start position:0%
depression and anxiety and suicide than
 
00:18:26.470 --> 00:18:26.480 align:start position:0%
that of the local law enforcement police
 
00:18:30.630 --> 00:18:30.640 align:start position:0%
police officers one study shows that
 
00:18:32.070 --> 00:18:32.080 align:start position:0%
that anxiety and stress or
 
00:18:34.390 --> 00:18:34.400 align:start position:0%
post-traumatic stress syndrome
 
00:18:34.400 --> 00:18:35.510 align:start position:0%
post-traumatic stress syndrome
syndrome

00:18:35.510 --> 00:18:35.520 align:start position:0%
syndrome
 
00:18:37.990 --> 00:18:38.000 align:start position:0%
is at about 53 percent of corrections
 
00:18:40.470 --> 00:18:40.480 align:start position:0%
officers where it's 30 some percent for
 
00:18:43.510 --> 00:18:43.520 align:start position:0%
police officers and suicides are six
 
00:18:47.669 --> 00:18:47.679 align:start position:0%
percent higher than the average uh in
 
00:18:50.230 --> 00:18:50.240 align:start position:0%
the general population
 
00:18:54.070 --> 00:18:54.080 align:start position:0%
we don't see suicides occurring
 
00:18:55.669 --> 00:18:55.679 align:start position:0%
in our
 
00:18:59.750 --> 00:18:59.760 align:start position:0%
population our our staff population but
 
00:19:01.750 --> 00:19:01.760 align:start position:0%
if it occurs and the anxiety and the
 
00:19:03.830 --> 00:19:03.840 align:start position:0%
stress that occurs
 
00:19:05.830 --> 00:19:05.840 align:start position:0%
if it happens we think that our
 
00:19:07.510 --> 00:19:07.520 align:start position:0%
corrections officers
 
00:19:09.990 --> 00:19:10.000 align:start position:0%
and our probation and parole officers
 
00:19:11.510 --> 00:19:11.520 align:start position:0%
should have the same
 
00:19:13.669 --> 00:19:13.679 align:start position:0%
advantage or their families have the
 
00:19:16.150 --> 00:19:16.160 align:start position:0%
same advantage that other law
 
00:19:17.510 --> 00:19:17.520 align:start position:0%
enforcement in the state of new
 
00:19:19.510 --> 00:19:19.520 align:start position:0%
hampshire do have when it comes to
 
00:19:21.350 --> 00:19:21.360 align:start position:0%
taking care of their families
 
00:19:24.310 --> 00:19:24.320 align:start position:0%
as a result of a suicide that occurs
 
00:19:26.230 --> 00:19:26.240 align:start position:0%
because of death in
 
00:19:28.470 --> 00:19:28.480 align:start position:0%
or excuse me a suicide that occurs
 
00:19:30.630 --> 00:19:30.640 align:start position:0%
because of the stress that occurs
 
00:19:32.630 --> 00:19:32.640 align:start position:0%
resulting from the job
 
00:19:35.909 --> 00:19:35.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:37.110 --> 00:19:37.120 align:start position:0%
point that i
 
00:19:38.950 --> 00:19:38.960 align:start position:0%
would like to make and i've testified in
 
00:19:40.470 --> 00:19:40.480 align:start position:0%
the senate on this
 
00:19:42.549 --> 00:19:42.559 align:start position:0%
that there is an officer down memorial
 
00:19:42.559 --> 00:19:43.510 align:start position:0%
that there is an officer down memorial
page

00:19:43.510 --> 00:19:43.520 align:start position:0%
page
 
00:19:46.070 --> 00:19:46.080 align:start position:0%
that shows you on an annual basis the
 
00:19:47.190 --> 00:19:47.200 align:start position:0%
number of
 
00:19:49.350 --> 00:19:49.360 align:start position:0%
law enforcement that are killed in the
 
00:19:52.710 --> 00:19:52.720 align:start position:0%
line of duty or take their own life
 
00:19:56.310 --> 00:19:56.320 align:start position:0%
by suicide and the the numbers are sort
 
00:19:58.870 --> 00:19:58.880 align:start position:0%
of striking
 
00:20:02.789 --> 00:20:02.799 align:start position:0%
in that in 2015 167 individuals
 
00:20:07.029 --> 00:20:07.039 align:start position:0%
nationwide in law enforcement were
 
00:20:09.510 --> 00:20:09.520 align:start position:0%
killed in the line of duty six of those
 
00:20:12.390 --> 00:20:12.400 align:start position:0%
were corrections officers and 50 of
 
00:20:14.149 --> 00:20:14.159 align:start position:0%
those that were
 
00:20:16.710 --> 00:20:16.720 align:start position:0%
killed were killed by assault
 
00:20:16.720 --> 00:20:17.909 align:start position:0%
killed were killed by assault
now

00:20:17.909 --> 00:20:17.919 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:20:20.390 --> 00:20:20.400 align:start position:0%
the bill not only for corrections
 
00:20:24.149 --> 00:20:24.159 align:start position:0%
officers allows the the suicide to be
 
00:20:27.029 --> 00:20:27.039 align:start position:0%
incorporated in the death benefit but it
 
00:20:29.029 --> 00:20:29.039 align:start position:0%
for the first time allows corrections
 
00:20:31.750 --> 00:20:31.760 align:start position:0%
officers to also be included in any
 
00:20:33.190 --> 00:20:33.200 align:start position:0%
death benefit
 
00:20:36.870 --> 00:20:36.880 align:start position:0%
and what we're also proposing is that we
 
00:20:39.029 --> 00:20:39.039 align:start position:0%
include the probation and parole
 
00:20:41.590 --> 00:20:41.600 align:start position:0%
officers who on a daily basis are out on
 
00:20:43.350 --> 00:20:43.360 align:start position:0%
the streets
 
00:20:45.350 --> 00:20:45.360 align:start position:0%
working with those felons that still
 
00:20:48.149 --> 00:20:48.159 align:start position:0%
have sentences remaining
 
00:20:49.990 --> 00:20:50.000 align:start position:0%
that same page that i was talking about
 
00:20:52.070 --> 00:20:52.080 align:start position:0%
the officer down memorial page
 
00:20:55.590 --> 00:20:55.600 align:start position:0%
uh shows that in 2017 there were 186
 
00:20:58.789 --> 00:20:58.799 align:start position:0%
deaths in law enforcement nine of them
 
00:20:58.799 --> 00:20:59.669 align:start position:0%
deaths in law enforcement nine of them
were

00:20:59.669 --> 00:20:59.679 align:start position:0%
were
 
00:21:01.190 --> 00:21:01.200 align:start position:0%
excuse me
 
00:21:04.390 --> 00:21:04.400 align:start position:0%
this was 2017 186 deaths nine of them
 
00:21:07.190 --> 00:21:07.200 align:start position:0%
corrections officers and about 50
 
00:21:09.350 --> 00:21:09.360 align:start position:0%
percent of those were through or from a
 
00:21:11.029 --> 00:21:11.039 align:start position:0%
heart attack
 
00:21:15.190 --> 00:21:15.200 align:start position:0%
in 2018 188 deaths 12 corrections
 
00:21:18.310 --> 00:21:18.320 align:start position:0%
officers and then in 1920 and 21 we see
 
00:21:21.270 --> 00:21:21.280 align:start position:0%
those numbers increasing to about 400
 
00:21:23.830 --> 00:21:23.840 align:start position:0%
deaths an average of about 400 deaths
 
00:21:26.390 --> 00:21:26.400 align:start position:0%
per year but they were due mostly to
 
00:21:26.400 --> 00:21:27.510 align:start position:0%
per year but they were due mostly to
covet

00:21:27.510 --> 00:21:27.520 align:start position:0%
covet
 
00:21:29.669 --> 00:21:29.679 align:start position:0%
so we're not seeing
 
00:21:31.830 --> 00:21:31.840 align:start position:0%
the rates and numbers and again these
 
00:21:34.630 --> 00:21:34.640 align:start position:0%
are nationwide numbers so from a fiscal
 
00:21:37.110 --> 00:21:37.120 align:start position:0%
impact to the state of new hampshire we
 
00:21:38.789 --> 00:21:38.799 align:start position:0%
at the department of corrections don't
 
00:21:42.390 --> 00:21:42.400 align:start position:0%
see this as anything that is significant
 
00:21:42.400 --> 00:21:43.190 align:start position:0%
see this as anything that is significant
and

00:21:43.190 --> 00:21:43.200 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:21:45.510 --> 00:21:45.520 align:start position:0%
would be a challenge to the state to pay
 
00:21:47.430 --> 00:21:47.440 align:start position:0%
for any law enforcement including
 
00:21:49.830 --> 00:21:49.840 align:start position:0%
corrections officers who die in the line
 
00:21:52.630 --> 00:21:52.640 align:start position:0%
of duty or by suicide
 
00:21:54.789 --> 00:21:54.799 align:start position:0%
if there are no questions i will take my
 
00:21:56.630 --> 00:21:56.640 align:start position:0%
seat but i'm happy to answer any
 
00:21:56.640 --> 00:21:58.390 align:start position:0%
seat but i'm happy to answer any
questions

00:21:58.390 --> 00:21:58.400 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:22:00.630 --> 00:22:00.640 align:start position:0%
representative weiler
 
00:22:01.990 --> 00:22:02.000 align:start position:0%
uh thank you
 
00:22:04.710 --> 00:22:04.720 align:start position:0%
uh miss cusack did you bring this
 
00:22:07.430 --> 00:22:07.440 align:start position:0%
proposal to the senate to have probation
 
00:22:10.149 --> 00:22:10.159 align:start position:0%
parole officers included yes we did so
 
00:22:13.190 --> 00:22:13.200 align:start position:0%
um the we started or initiated this
 
00:22:16.230 --> 00:22:16.240 align:start position:0%
process in um 2020 i believe with house
 
00:22:19.029 --> 00:22:19.039 align:start position:0%
bill or 2021 with house bill 91
 
00:22:21.350 --> 00:22:21.360 align:start position:0%
and we attempted to change some language
 
00:22:21.360 --> 00:22:22.630 align:start position:0%
and we attempted to change some language
there

00:22:22.630 --> 00:22:22.640 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:22:24.789 --> 00:22:24.799 align:start position:0%
in this year we brought
 
00:22:24.799 --> 00:22:26.310 align:start position:0%
in this year we brought
1319

00:22:26.310 --> 00:22:26.320 align:start position:0%
1319
 
00:22:29.190 --> 00:22:29.200 align:start position:0%
forward and included
 
00:22:30.789 --> 00:22:30.799 align:start position:0%
not only our probation and parole
 
00:22:33.029 --> 00:22:33.039 align:start position:0%
officers but corrections line personnel
 
00:22:36.230 --> 00:22:36.240 align:start position:0%
so we attempted to change the definition
 
00:22:39.190 --> 00:22:39.200 align:start position:0%
of who law enforcement were in that bill
 
00:22:41.350 --> 00:22:41.360 align:start position:0%
unfortunately both of those bills were
 
00:22:43.270 --> 00:22:43.280 align:start position:0%
laid on the table and sent to in
 
00:22:45.830 --> 00:22:45.840 align:start position:0%
potentially interim study
 
00:22:47.909 --> 00:22:47.919 align:start position:0%
this is our last chance for this
 
00:22:50.149 --> 00:22:50.159 align:start position:0%
legislative session to get something
 
00:22:52.149 --> 00:22:52.159 align:start position:0%
done for our corrections officers thank
 
00:22:55.909 --> 00:22:55.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:58.630 --> 00:22:58.640 align:start position:0%
representative yep representative emrick
 
00:23:00.710 --> 00:23:00.720 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
00:23:02.390 --> 00:23:02.400 align:start position:0%
so we need to have an amendment that
 
00:23:02.400 --> 00:23:04.070 align:start position:0%
so we need to have an amendment that
includes

00:23:04.070 --> 00:23:04.080 align:start position:0%
includes
 
00:23:06.070 --> 00:23:06.080 align:start position:0%
probation officers parole officers are
 
00:23:07.590 --> 00:23:07.600 align:start position:0%
there any other titles that need to be
 
00:23:09.669 --> 00:23:09.679 align:start position:0%
included and what we would also our
 
00:23:11.669 --> 00:23:11.679 align:start position:0%
legend or our testimony says corrections
 
00:23:14.470 --> 00:23:14.480 align:start position:0%
line personnel and those individuals are
 
00:23:16.950 --> 00:23:16.960 align:start position:0%
our nurses our social workers our
 
00:23:16.960 --> 00:23:18.470 align:start position:0%
our nurses our social workers our
chaplains

00:23:18.470 --> 00:23:18.480 align:start position:0%
chaplains
 
00:23:21.430 --> 00:23:21.440 align:start position:0%
who work in the facility and our subject
 
00:23:24.549 --> 00:23:24.559 align:start position:0%
potentially to the same serious threats
 
00:23:27.669 --> 00:23:27.679 align:start position:0%
that our corrections officers are
 
00:23:29.510 --> 00:23:29.520 align:start position:0%
the federal
 
00:23:32.070 --> 00:23:32.080 align:start position:0%
there's federal law that and the bureau
 
00:23:34.390 --> 00:23:34.400 align:start position:0%
of prisons allows their corrections line
 
00:23:37.190 --> 00:23:37.200 align:start position:0%
personnel to receive these benefits
 
00:23:39.909 --> 00:23:39.919 align:start position:0%
including chaplains i've i've read
 
00:23:41.830 --> 00:23:41.840 align:start position:0%
testimony and seen the legislation on
 
00:23:41.840 --> 00:23:43.430 align:start position:0%
testimony and seen the legislation on
that

00:23:43.430 --> 00:23:43.440 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:23:45.430 --> 00:23:45.440 align:start position:0%
so the follow-up
 
00:23:47.990 --> 00:23:48.000 align:start position:0%
yes the term corrections line personnel
 
00:23:51.350 --> 00:23:51.360 align:start position:0%
would cover all these all the ancillary
 
00:23:52.390 --> 00:23:52.400 align:start position:0%
they're a little bit different than the
 
00:23:54.149 --> 00:23:54.159 align:start position:0%
probation and parole officer so it would
 
00:23:55.990 --> 00:23:56.000 align:start position:0%
be corrections officers
 
00:23:58.549 --> 00:23:58.559 align:start position:0%
probation parole officers and correction
 
00:24:01.190 --> 00:24:01.200 align:start position:0%
line personnel which yes does include
 
00:24:03.510 --> 00:24:03.520 align:start position:0%
those ancillary chaplains nurses social
 
00:24:06.630 --> 00:24:06.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:08.789 --> 00:24:08.799 align:start position:0%
are there any further questions
 
00:24:10.149 --> 00:24:10.159 align:start position:0%
representative heath
 
00:24:12.070 --> 00:24:12.080 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um my question is
 
00:24:14.230 --> 00:24:14.240 align:start position:0%
just with regard to juvenile parole
 
00:24:14.240 --> 00:24:15.269 align:start position:0%
just with regard to juvenile parole
officers

00:24:15.269 --> 00:24:15.279 align:start position:0%
officers
 
00:24:18.470 --> 00:24:18.480 align:start position:0%
um where would they fit in this so the
 
00:24:21.190 --> 00:24:21.200 align:start position:0%
department of corrections does not
 
00:24:23.430 --> 00:24:23.440 align:start position:0%
we we do not have
 
00:24:24.950 --> 00:24:24.960 align:start position:0%
any juvenile probation and parole
 
00:24:28.230 --> 00:24:28.240 align:start position:0%
officers as our employees they are with
 
00:24:29.990 --> 00:24:30.000 align:start position:0%
department of health and human services
 
00:24:32.950 --> 00:24:32.960 align:start position:0%
and i am uncertain as to whether they um
 
00:24:34.870 --> 00:24:34.880 align:start position:0%
have taken a
 
00:24:34.880 --> 00:24:36.149 align:start position:0%
have taken a
active

00:24:36.149 --> 00:24:36.159 align:start position:0%
active
 
00:24:38.549 --> 00:24:38.559 align:start position:0%
role in in looking at this legislation
 
00:24:41.830 --> 00:24:41.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:44.710 --> 00:24:44.720 align:start position:0%
represent walt
 
00:24:46.070 --> 00:24:46.080 align:start position:0%
that was my first question that was
 
00:24:47.909 --> 00:24:47.919 align:start position:0%
answered about jppos that i think if
 
00:24:49.029 --> 00:24:49.039 align:start position:0%
you're going to include probation and
 
00:24:50.549 --> 00:24:50.559 align:start position:0%
parole officers we should be including
 
00:24:52.710 --> 00:24:52.720 align:start position:0%
jppos because there's really no
 
00:24:54.630 --> 00:24:54.640 align:start position:0%
difference but i i just want to let you
 
00:24:57.430 --> 00:24:57.440 align:start position:0%
know that about 10 years ago this body
 
00:25:00.070 --> 00:25:00.080 align:start position:0%
created a study of gangs in this state
 
00:25:03.590 --> 00:25:03.600 align:start position:0%
and i sat on that commission and the
 
00:25:05.590 --> 00:25:05.600 align:start position:0%
finding was is that we didn't we had a
 
00:25:07.269 --> 00:25:07.279 align:start position:0%
small problem with gangs in manchester
 
00:25:08.710 --> 00:25:08.720 align:start position:0%
and nashua but the biggest problem with
 
00:25:10.549 --> 00:25:10.559 align:start position:0%
gangs was within our prisons and it

sounds like that's unchanged is that
true

i do have i
 
00:28:08.710 --> 00:28:08.720 align:start position:0%

00:28:11.840 --> 00:28:12.630 align:start position:0%
will find out uh what happened um with
the

00:28:12.630 --> 00:28:12.640 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:28:12.640 --> 00:28:14.070 align:start position:0%
the
amendment

00:28:14.070 --> 00:28:14.080 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:28:16.870 --> 00:28:16.880 align:start position:0%
in senate i think it's either edna or
 
00:28:18.870 --> 00:28:18.880 align:start position:0%
senate finance i'm not sure
 
00:28:22.149 --> 00:28:22.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:24.230 --> 00:28:24.240 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you for
 
00:28:27.590 --> 00:28:27.600 align:start position:0%
taking the stand again um i understand
 
00:28:29.669 --> 00:28:29.679 align:start position:0%
the general concept my questions i have
 
00:28:31.430 --> 00:28:31.440 align:start position:0%
a couple on
 
00:28:31.440 --> 00:28:32.230 align:start position:0%
a couple on
uh

00:28:32.230 --> 00:28:32.240 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:28:34.149 --> 00:28:34.159 align:start position:0%
the tech the technical language i guess
 
00:28:36.310 --> 00:28:36.320 align:start position:0%
would be the the uh
 
00:28:36.320 --> 00:28:37.350 align:start position:0%
would be the the uh
issue

00:28:37.350 --> 00:28:37.360 align:start position:0%
issue
 
00:28:39.669 --> 00:28:39.679 align:start position:0%
is it the intent of this
 
00:28:39.679 --> 00:28:40.470 align:start position:0%
is it the intent of this
that

00:28:40.470 --> 00:28:40.480 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:28:43.750 --> 00:28:43.760 align:start position:0%
any suicide of the named individuals
 
00:28:46.149 --> 00:28:46.159 align:start position:0%
that are under here would automatically
 
00:28:46.159 --> 00:28:47.029 align:start position:0%
that are under here would automatically
uh

00:28:47.029 --> 00:28:47.039 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:28:48.710 --> 00:28:48.720 align:start position:0%
be eligible for the payout is that the
 
00:28:48.720 --> 00:28:49.669 align:start position:0%
be eligible for the payout is that the
intent

00:28:49.669 --> 00:28:49.679 align:start position:0%
intent
 
00:28:51.750 --> 00:28:51.760 align:start position:0%
my understanding is
 
00:28:53.590 --> 00:28:53.600 align:start position:0%
there is first an investigation because
 
00:28:56.310 --> 00:28:56.320 align:start position:0%
we we covered this in our commission
 
00:28:56.320 --> 00:28:57.269 align:start position:0%
we we covered this in our commission
um

00:28:57.269 --> 00:28:57.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:28:59.669 --> 00:28:59.679 align:start position:0%
there's when there's a whenever there's
 
00:29:01.669 --> 00:29:01.679 align:start position:0%
a death whether it's a suicide and you
 
00:29:03.990 --> 00:29:04.000 align:start position:0%
can correct me if i'm wrong over there
 
00:29:06.149 --> 00:29:06.159 align:start position:0%
but anytime there's a death whether
 
00:29:07.590 --> 00:29:07.600 align:start position:0%
suicide or
 
00:29:08.789 --> 00:29:08.799 align:start position:0%
a typical
 
00:29:10.549 --> 00:29:10.559 align:start position:0%
line of duty
 
00:29:12.789 --> 00:29:12.799 align:start position:0%
there is an investigation and if they
 
00:29:15.830 --> 00:29:15.840 align:start position:0%
find that this was a cause
 
00:29:19.029 --> 00:29:19.039 align:start position:0%
um was an in line of duty cause then it
 
00:29:23.190 --> 00:29:23.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:26.630 --> 00:29:26.640 align:start position:0%
thank you follow up thank you um
 
00:29:26.640 --> 00:29:27.750 align:start position:0%
thank you follow up thank you um
okay

00:29:27.750 --> 00:29:27.760 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:29:30.789 --> 00:29:30.799 align:start position:0%
on line five it talks um
 
00:29:33.190 --> 00:29:33.200 align:start position:0%
i think it kind of introduces a new a
 
00:29:35.190 --> 00:29:35.200 align:start position:0%
new term let's go back actually line
 
00:29:37.190 --> 00:29:37.200 align:start position:0%
four we it talks of an incident accident
 
00:29:39.190 --> 00:29:39.200 align:start position:0%
violence cause of dance death and
 
00:29:41.430 --> 00:29:41.440 align:start position:0%
injuries and then on line five and six
 
00:29:44.470 --> 00:29:44.480 align:start position:0%
it introduces a term called work related
 
00:29:46.710 --> 00:29:46.720 align:start position:0%
yet it's not really
 
00:29:48.870 --> 00:29:48.880 align:start position:0%
defined as work related supposed to be
 
00:29:53.350 --> 00:29:53.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:55.269 --> 00:29:55.279 align:start position:0%
what what is that
 
00:29:57.269 --> 00:29:57.279 align:start position:0%
it just appears to me to introduce
 
00:29:58.549 --> 00:29:58.559 align:start position:0%
something new that's not really
 
00:30:02.870 --> 00:30:02.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:05.750 --> 00:30:05.760 align:start position:0%
well i think going back to my first
 
00:30:08.230 --> 00:30:08.240 align:start position:0%
answer is after the investigation if
 
00:30:10.950 --> 00:30:10.960 align:start position:0%
it's um looked at as work related or
 
00:30:12.310 --> 00:30:12.320 align:start position:0%
caused by
 
00:30:15.110 --> 00:30:15.120 align:start position:0%
an incident that they had then it would
 
00:30:18.230 --> 00:30:18.240 align:start position:0%
be work-related cause of death
 
00:30:20.549 --> 00:30:20.559 align:start position:0%
that finding has to be
 
00:30:24.070 --> 00:30:24.080 align:start position:0%
um that it has to have a finding of warp
 
00:30:27.990 --> 00:30:28.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:30.470 --> 00:30:30.480 align:start position:0%
thank you one more one more thank you
 
00:30:32.070 --> 00:30:32.080 align:start position:0%
so uh
 
00:30:33.830 --> 00:30:33.840 align:start position:0%
on line six then it talks about the
 
00:30:33.840 --> 00:30:34.950 align:start position:0%
on line six then it talks about the
incident

00:30:34.950 --> 00:30:34.960 align:start position:0%
incident
 
00:30:34.960 --> 00:30:36.389 align:start position:0%
incident
on

00:30:36.389 --> 00:30:36.399 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:30:38.630 --> 00:30:38.640 align:start position:0%
who will make the determination is so it
 
00:30:40.710 --> 00:30:40.720 align:start position:0%
would that be your intent that
 
00:30:43.110 --> 00:30:43.120 align:start position:0%
the determination is made by one of the
 
00:30:45.669 --> 00:30:45.679 align:start position:0%
three or four indiv
 
00:30:47.590 --> 00:30:47.600 align:start position:0%
groups or individuals that are listed
 
00:30:47.600 --> 00:30:53.350 align:start position:0%
groups or individuals that are listed
there

00:30:53.350 --> 00:30:53.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:55.110 --> 00:30:55.120 align:start position:0%
well again i think it's the workers comp
 
00:30:57.350 --> 00:30:57.360 align:start position:0%
insurance carrier that would be doing
 
00:31:00.630 --> 00:31:00.640 align:start position:0%
the investigation as well as the police
 
00:31:03.750 --> 00:31:03.760 align:start position:0%
department or the fire department or the
 
00:31:05.990 --> 00:31:06.000 align:start position:0%
corrections department
 
00:31:07.830 --> 00:31:07.840 align:start position:0%
along with the insurance the workers
 
00:31:09.669 --> 00:31:09.679 align:start position:0%
comp insurance carrier
 
00:31:12.470 --> 00:31:12.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:13.750 --> 00:31:13.760 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
00:31:16.470 --> 00:31:16.480 align:start position:0%
hope that helps
 
00:31:18.549 --> 00:31:18.559 align:start position:0%
represent lynn
 
00:31:19.830 --> 00:31:19.840 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:31:23.029 --> 00:31:23.039 align:start position:0%

00:31:25.269 --> 00:31:25.279 align:start position:0%
should i understand that i think that
 
00:31:26.630 --> 00:31:26.640 align:start position:0%
the issue that
 
00:31:28.389 --> 00:31:28.399 align:start position:0%
may raise the question and this might be
 
00:31:29.830 --> 00:31:29.840 align:start position:0%
part of what representative turcotte was
 
00:31:32.870 --> 00:31:32.880 align:start position:0%
asking about is it talks in the on line
 
00:31:34.470 --> 00:31:34.480 align:start position:0%
three about
 
00:31:34.480 --> 00:31:35.909 align:start position:0%
three about
um

00:31:35.909 --> 00:31:35.919 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:31:35.919 --> 00:31:37.590 align:start position:0%
um
uh

00:31:37.590 --> 00:31:37.600 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:31:40.070 --> 00:31:40.080 align:start position:0%
killed in the line of duty uh means
 
00:31:42.549 --> 00:31:42.559 align:start position:0%
while in the performance of of your
 
00:31:44.789 --> 00:31:44.799 align:start position:0%
duties so i but i take it from what
 
00:31:47.190 --> 00:31:47.200 align:start position:0%
you're saying is for example
 
00:31:49.350 --> 00:31:49.360 align:start position:0%
let's suppose that uh there's you know
 
00:31:52.070 --> 00:31:52.080 align:start position:0%
i'm sort of making up a uh
 
00:31:54.149 --> 00:31:54.159 align:start position:0%
an example that may it may not
 
00:31:55.509 --> 00:31:55.519 align:start position:0%
may not in fact
 
00:31:55.519 --> 00:31:56.310 align:start position:0%
may not in fact
uh

00:31:56.310 --> 00:31:56.320 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:31:58.230 --> 00:31:58.240 align:start position:0%
comport with with what actually happened
 
00:31:59.830 --> 00:31:59.840 align:start position:0%
but suppose that there's like there's
 
00:32:02.230 --> 00:32:02.240 align:start position:0%
been a series of tragic fires let's say
 
00:32:02.240 --> 00:32:03.190 align:start position:0%
been a series of tragic fires let's say
where

00:32:03.190 --> 00:32:03.200 align:start position:0%
where
 
00:32:05.269 --> 00:32:05.279 align:start position:0%
other firemen have been killed in the
 
00:32:07.110 --> 00:32:07.120 align:start position:0%
in the line of duty that kind of thing
 
00:32:08.710 --> 00:32:08.720 align:start position:0%
and a fireman
 
00:32:08.720 --> 00:32:09.750 align:start position:0%
and a fireman
um

00:32:09.750 --> 00:32:09.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:32:12.789 --> 00:32:12.799 align:start position:0%
commits suicide not at the scene or on
 
00:32:15.269 --> 00:32:15.279 align:start position:0%
the way to or or
 
00:32:17.029 --> 00:32:17.039 align:start position:0%
or back to the station from the scene
 
00:32:20.310 --> 00:32:20.320 align:start position:0%
but a few days later
 
00:32:21.909 --> 00:32:21.919 align:start position:0%
am i understanding correctly from what
 
00:32:23.990 --> 00:32:24.000 align:start position:0%
you've said that if if it were
 
00:32:26.070 --> 00:32:26.080 align:start position:0%
determined by
 
00:32:27.590 --> 00:32:27.600 align:start position:0%
you know the insurance company or
 
00:32:29.750 --> 00:32:29.760 align:start position:0%
appropriate medical professionals that
 
00:32:32.549 --> 00:32:32.559 align:start position:0%
in fact the cause of the of the firemen
 
00:32:32.559 --> 00:32:33.830 align:start position:0%
in fact the cause of the of the firemen
suicide

00:32:33.830 --> 00:32:33.840 align:start position:0%
suicide
 
00:32:36.389 --> 00:32:36.399 align:start position:0%
several days later was as a result of
 
00:32:37.830 --> 00:32:37.840 align:start position:0%
the series of incidents that had
 
00:32:39.509 --> 00:32:39.519 align:start position:0%
happened where fellow officers had been
 
00:32:41.590 --> 00:32:41.600 align:start position:0%
killed etc that would be eligible for
 
00:32:42.710 --> 00:32:42.720 align:start position:0%
the benefit
 
00:32:45.350 --> 00:32:45.360 align:start position:0%
that is my intention and as well as
 
00:32:47.830 --> 00:32:47.840 align:start position:0%
we've we've heard testimony dur in the
 
00:32:50.630 --> 00:32:50.640 align:start position:0%
commission often times where
 
00:32:54.230 --> 00:32:54.240 align:start position:0%
uh firefighters or police officers have
 
00:32:57.110 --> 00:32:57.120 align:start position:0%
gone to several fires let's say and
 
00:32:59.350 --> 00:32:59.360 align:start position:0%
they've found they've had to deal with
 
00:33:02.310 --> 00:33:02.320 align:start position:0%
the death of young children or babies
 
00:33:04.470 --> 00:33:04.480 align:start position:0%
it doesn't happen right away it
 
00:33:06.630 --> 00:33:06.640 align:start position:0%
sometimes it takes months
 
00:33:11.110 --> 00:33:11.120 align:start position:0%
for this to um develop into a suicidal
 
00:33:12.630 --> 00:33:12.640 align:start position:0%
attempt and there
 
00:33:15.830 --> 00:33:15.840 align:start position:0%
many times there may be some
 
00:33:19.990 --> 00:33:20.000 align:start position:0%
signs that the family sees but the
 
00:33:22.389 --> 00:33:22.399 align:start position:0%
the their workers don't see
 
00:33:25.029 --> 00:33:25.039 align:start position:0%
but many times it takes months
 
00:33:27.750 --> 00:33:27.760 align:start position:0%
and develop um
 
00:33:31.669 --> 00:33:31.679 align:start position:0%
the suicidal tendencies and so yes um it
 
00:33:34.149 --> 00:33:34.159 align:start position:0%
doesn't happen right away it can take
 
00:33:37.350 --> 00:33:37.360 align:start position:0%
weeks months even sometimes years
 
00:33:41.190 --> 00:33:41.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:44.230 --> 00:33:44.240 align:start position:0%
are there any further questions
 
00:33:45.669 --> 00:33:45.679 align:start position:0%
represent murray
 
00:33:47.509 --> 00:33:47.519 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair i forgive my
 
00:33:50.310 --> 00:33:50.320 align:start position:0%
naivete um i'm from a very small town
 
00:33:52.549 --> 00:33:52.559 align:start position:0%
and we rely a lot on volunteers
 
00:33:53.990 --> 00:33:54.000 align:start position:0%
and basically if something happens
 
00:33:56.070 --> 00:33:56.080 align:start position:0%
everybody shows up and some of these
 
00:33:58.149 --> 00:33:58.159 align:start position:0%
volunteers particularly emts and the
 
00:33:58.159 --> 00:33:59.430 align:start position:0%
volunteers particularly emts and the
firefighters

00:33:59.430 --> 00:33:59.440 align:start position:0%
firefighters
 
00:34:00.630 --> 00:34:00.640 align:start position:0%
this is what they do they're very
 
00:34:02.630 --> 00:34:02.640 align:start position:0%
dedicated to this and in reading this
 
00:34:04.149 --> 00:34:04.159 align:start position:0%
when i first read it i'm hearing that
 
00:34:06.070 --> 00:34:06.080 align:start position:0%
it's for professionals
 
00:34:07.590 --> 00:34:07.600 align:start position:0%
but the way i'm reading it now after
 
00:34:09.589 --> 00:34:09.599 align:start position:0%
representative turcotte's comments does
 
00:34:12.950 --> 00:34:12.960 align:start position:0%
this pertain to volunteers as well
 
00:34:14.790 --> 00:34:14.800 align:start position:0%
it better
 
00:34:16.550 --> 00:34:16.560 align:start position:0%
i will i will have to check on that but
 
00:34:19.829 --> 00:34:19.839 align:start position:0%
i believe it does oh thank you but and
 
00:34:19.839 --> 00:34:21.109 align:start position:0%
i believe it does oh thank you but and
um

00:34:21.109 --> 00:34:21.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:34:22.869 --> 00:34:22.879 align:start position:0%
the chief also just
 
00:34:22.879 --> 00:34:23.990 align:start position:0%
the chief also just
um

00:34:23.990 --> 00:34:24.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:34:27.109 --> 00:34:27.119 align:start position:0%
had me look at this um this is based on
 
00:34:29.829 --> 00:34:29.839 align:start position:0%
a supreme court decision um
 
00:34:32.389 --> 00:34:32.399 align:start position:0%
the dotier case it says there are four
 
00:34:34.950 --> 00:34:34.960 align:start position:0%
types of injury-causing risks commonly
 
00:34:37.190 --> 00:34:37.200 align:start position:0%
faced by an employee at work
 
00:34:39.430 --> 00:34:39.440 align:start position:0%
one risks directly associated with
 
00:34:39.440 --> 00:34:40.550 align:start position:0%
one risks directly associated with
employment

00:34:40.550 --> 00:34:40.560 align:start position:0%
employment
 
00:34:43.750 --> 00:34:43.760 align:start position:0%
two risks personal to the claimant
 
00:34:47.909 --> 00:34:47.919 align:start position:0%
three mixed risks and four neutral risks
 
00:34:50.069 --> 00:34:50.079 align:start position:0%
the first category employment related
 
00:34:52.310 --> 00:34:52.320 align:start position:0%
risks includes the risk of injuries
 
00:34:54.389 --> 00:34:54.399 align:start position:0%
generally recognized as industrial
 
00:34:56.389 --> 00:34:56.399 align:start position:0%
injuries such as fingers being caught in
 
00:34:56.399 --> 00:34:57.750 align:start position:0%
injuries such as fingers being caught in
gears

00:34:57.750 --> 00:34:57.760 align:start position:0%
gears
 
00:34:59.829 --> 00:34:59.839 align:start position:0%
this category of risk always arises out
 
00:35:02.950 --> 00:35:02.960 align:start position:0%
of employment now the daughter decision
 
00:35:06.550 --> 00:35:06.560 align:start position:0%
um was made not too long ago
 
00:35:09.109 --> 00:35:09.119 align:start position:0%
20 november or 2020
 
00:35:11.430 --> 00:35:11.440 align:start position:0%
that and the opinion was issued that
 
00:35:16.550 --> 00:35:16.560 align:start position:0%
suicide can be seen as work-related
 
00:35:16.560 --> 00:35:19.589 align:start position:0%
suicide can be seen as work-related
so

00:35:19.589 --> 00:35:19.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:22.790 --> 00:35:22.800 align:start position:0%
thank you very much uh represent walls
 
00:35:24.790 --> 00:35:24.800 align:start position:0%
what court issued that decision
 
00:35:26.790 --> 00:35:26.800 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry what court issued that
 
00:35:28.950 --> 00:35:28.960 align:start position:0%
decision to state the federal
 
00:35:32.630 --> 00:35:32.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:34.790 --> 00:35:34.800 align:start position:0%
is there anything else
 
00:35:37.829 --> 00:35:37.839 align:start position:0%
seeing none and thank you very much oh
 
00:35:39.349 --> 00:35:39.359 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry uh rep
 
00:35:41.829 --> 00:35:41.839 align:start position:0%
representative murray's uh question is
 
00:35:41.839 --> 00:35:43.030 align:start position:0%
representative murray's uh question is
still

00:35:43.030 --> 00:35:43.040 align:start position:0%
still
 
00:35:44.870 --> 00:35:44.880 align:start position:0%
ponder i'm still pondering it and i
 
00:35:47.670 --> 00:35:47.680 align:start position:0%
don't think we got a good answer
 
00:35:49.430 --> 00:35:49.440 align:start position:0%
does anybody know what the definition of
 
00:35:51.750 --> 00:35:51.760 align:start position:0%
professional is in terms of emts and
 
00:35:51.760 --> 00:35:52.950 align:start position:0%
professional is in terms of emts and
firefighters

00:35:52.950 --> 00:35:52.960 align:start position:0%
firefighters
 
00:35:55.030 --> 00:35:55.040 align:start position:0%
uh would it just be for the fact that
 
00:35:57.750 --> 00:35:57.760 align:start position:0%
they get paid many volunteer fire
 
00:35:57.760 --> 00:35:59.109 align:start position:0%
they get paid many volunteer fire
members

00:35:59.109 --> 00:35:59.119 align:start position:0%
members
 
00:36:00.470 --> 00:36:00.480 align:start position:0%
pay their
 
00:36:02.790 --> 00:36:02.800 align:start position:0%
colleagues when they respond
 
00:36:05.030 --> 00:36:05.040 align:start position:0%
same with emts it's a de minimis amount
 
00:36:07.270 --> 00:36:07.280 align:start position:0%
but nevertheless they're they're paid so
 
00:36:08.470 --> 00:36:08.480 align:start position:0%
would that
 
00:36:10.470 --> 00:36:10.480 align:start position:0%
automatically include them i'm not a
 
00:36:13.109 --> 00:36:13.119 align:start position:0%
lawyer i don't know but i i would think
 
00:36:16.550 --> 00:36:16.560 align:start position:0%
it would be a travesty if it did
 
00:36:19.510 --> 00:36:19.520 align:start position:0%
i'm not confident but i will get back
 
00:36:21.030 --> 00:36:21.040 align:start position:0%
i'm i've
 
00:36:22.550 --> 00:36:22.560 align:start position:0%
i know this has been a topic of
 
00:36:24.630 --> 00:36:24.640 align:start position:0%
conversation in the commission
 
00:36:28.790 --> 00:36:28.800 align:start position:0%
um our intent was to i believe include
 
00:36:31.990 --> 00:36:32.000 align:start position:0%
everyone whether um volunteer or
 
00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:33.430 align:start position:0%

an amendment i would
 
00:36:40.069 --> 00:36:40.079 align:start position:0%
propose including language that would be
 
00:36:42.630 --> 00:36:42.640 align:start position:0%
definitive and assure that they are
 
00:36:44.470 --> 00:36:44.480 align:start position:0%

hampshire is in support of senate bill
 
00:39:20.710 --> 00:39:20.720 align:start position:0%
227 as we were in support of house bill
 
00:39:24.390 --> 00:39:24.400 align:start position:0%
91 which is a bill that's uh nearly
 
00:39:26.150 --> 00:39:26.160 align:start position:0%
identical to this one
 
00:39:28.550 --> 00:39:28.560 align:start position:0%
that passed um it was a bill from last
 
00:39:31.829 --> 00:39:31.839 align:start position:0%
session that passed the house um
 
00:39:34.310 --> 00:39:34.320 align:start position:0%
in the first session of this year um was
 
00:39:36.310 --> 00:39:36.320 align:start position:0%
considered by the senate
 
00:39:36.320 --> 00:39:38.150 align:start position:0%
considered by the senate
and

00:39:38.150 --> 00:39:38.160 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:39:40.390 --> 00:39:40.400 align:start position:0%
they ended up i think uh voting at
 
00:39:42.630 --> 00:39:42.640 align:start position:0%
interim study and moving the senate bill
 
00:39:44.550 --> 00:39:44.560 align:start position:0%
to 27 forward
 
00:39:44.560 --> 00:39:46.870 align:start position:0%
to 27 forward
um

00:39:46.870 --> 00:39:46.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:39:48.790 --> 00:39:48.800 align:start position:0%
you know we know that
 
00:39:51.109 --> 00:39:51.119 align:start position:0%
there are high numbers of suicides for
 
00:39:52.870 --> 00:39:52.880 align:start position:0%
first responders
 
00:39:54.550 --> 00:39:54.560 align:start position:0%
higher than the general public so we
 
00:39:57.030 --> 00:39:57.040 align:start position:0%
know that this work has an effect on
 
00:39:58.790 --> 00:39:58.800 align:start position:0%
those individuals
 
00:40:02.950 --> 00:40:02.960 align:start position:0%
that does stem directly from the work
 
00:40:07.190 --> 00:40:07.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:09.750 --> 00:40:09.760 align:start position:0%
an overabundance luckily of
 
00:40:11.589 --> 00:40:11.599 align:start position:0%
these suicides in new hampshire i
 
00:40:13.910 --> 00:40:13.920 align:start position:0%
believe there's been between five and
 
00:40:15.670 --> 00:40:15.680 align:start position:0%
in the last um
 
00:40:17.829 --> 00:40:17.839 align:start position:0%
six or seven years
 
00:40:19.910 --> 00:40:19.920 align:start position:0%
um but to those families even though
 
00:40:21.910 --> 00:40:21.920 align:start position:0%
there's not not very many of them to
 
00:40:24.069 --> 00:40:24.079 align:start position:0%
those families this this death benefit
 
00:40:26.069 --> 00:40:26.079 align:start position:0%
benefit would be tremendous
 
00:40:27.910 --> 00:40:27.920 align:start position:0%
and that's why we're in support of it um
 
00:40:30.150 --> 00:40:30.160 align:start position:0%
and i'll end it there again just make it
 
00:40:32.230 --> 00:40:32.240 align:start position:0%
sweet and we're in support of it and
 
00:40:34.470 --> 00:40:34.480 align:start position:0%

amends rsa 21p 37-c
 
00:41:46.309 --> 00:41:46.319 align:start position:0%
section c to further clarify how
 
00:41:49.190 --> 00:41:49.200 align:start position:0%
communities can obtain an emergency loan
 
00:41:51.510 --> 00:41:51.520 align:start position:0%
from the state for recovery for a
 
00:41:54.470 --> 00:41:54.480 align:start position:0%
catastrophic natural disaster
 
00:41:55.990 --> 00:41:56.000 align:start position:0%
i'm going to
 
00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:57.270 align:start position:0%
i'm going to
summarize

00:41:57.270 --> 00:41:57.280 align:start position:0%
summarize
 
00:41:59.750 --> 00:41:59.760 align:start position:0%
a story from this summer and i i trust
 
00:42:01.589 --> 00:42:01.599 align:start position:0%
that representative aaron is going to
 
00:42:04.470 --> 00:42:04.480 align:start position:0%
talk about this as well but i categorize
 
00:42:06.790 --> 00:42:06.800 align:start position:0%
this bill as being a bill that's you
 
00:42:09.190 --> 00:42:09.200 align:start position:0%
know for for the little guys helping out
 
00:42:10.870 --> 00:42:10.880 align:start position:0%
the smaller communities and i think
 
00:42:12.630 --> 00:42:12.640 align:start position:0%
that's an important perspective to keep
 
00:42:14.550 --> 00:42:14.560 align:start position:0%
as we move forward
 
00:42:17.349 --> 00:42:17.359 align:start position:0%
in the summer of 2021 parts of cheshire
 
00:42:20.069 --> 00:42:20.079 align:start position:0%
and sullivan county were impacted by two
 
00:42:23.510 --> 00:42:23.520 align:start position:0%
storms causing damage to roadways key
 
00:42:25.030 --> 00:42:25.040 align:start position:0%
pathways to work
 
00:42:27.270 --> 00:42:27.280 align:start position:0%
school and sustainability
 
00:42:29.670 --> 00:42:29.680 align:start position:0%
sustainability of the local economic to
 
00:42:31.910 --> 00:42:31.920 align:start position:0%
school and sustainability of the local
 
00:42:31.920 --> 00:42:32.950 align:start position:0%
school and sustainability of the local
economy

00:42:32.950 --> 00:42:32.960 align:start position:0%
economy
 
00:42:35.109 --> 00:42:35.119 align:start position:0%
these communities include but on our
 
00:42:37.270 --> 00:42:37.280 align:start position:0%
limited to charlestown which is in
 
00:42:38.630 --> 00:42:38.640 align:start position:0%
district 5
 
00:42:41.670 --> 00:42:41.680 align:start position:0%
and ackworth which is in district 8.
 
00:42:43.190 --> 00:42:43.200 align:start position:0%
there's three to four inches of rain
 
00:42:44.950 --> 00:42:44.960 align:start position:0%
that fell over acworth on the night of
 
00:42:47.589 --> 00:42:47.599 align:start position:0%
july 29th and 30th washed out roads
 
00:42:49.990 --> 00:42:50.000 align:start position:0%
roads damaged bridges and destroyed
 
00:42:52.550 --> 00:42:52.560 align:start position:0%
culverts around 30 roads which is three
 
00:42:54.630 --> 00:42:54.640 align:start position:0%
quarters of the town's total so i'm
 
00:42:56.470 --> 00:42:56.480 align:start position:0%
talking about acworth here and again
 
00:42:58.550 --> 00:42:58.560 align:start position:0%
representative aaron can correct me if
 
00:43:01.190 --> 00:43:01.200 align:start position:0%
i'm wrong we're damaged according to the
 
00:43:03.670 --> 00:43:03.680 align:start position:0%
engineer hired to oversee the repairs
 
00:43:05.910 --> 00:43:05.920 align:start position:0%
over a period of months necessary
 
00:43:08.550 --> 00:43:08.560 align:start position:0%
repairs have waited and some still do
 
00:43:11.270 --> 00:43:11.280 align:start position:0%
due to the part in lack of local dollars
 
00:43:13.349 --> 00:43:13.359 align:start position:0%
to address the need while waiting for
 
00:43:17.510 --> 00:43:17.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:19.750 --> 00:43:19.760 align:start position:0%
in acworth a town
 
00:43:22.390 --> 00:43:22.400 align:start position:0%
of under 900 residents and with a budget
 
00:43:24.069 --> 00:43:24.079 align:start position:0%
shy of three million dollars repairs
 
00:43:27.109 --> 00:43:27.119 align:start position:0%
were estimated at more than a million
 
00:43:30.069 --> 00:43:30.079 align:start position:0%
dollars the amount the estimate provided
 
00:43:32.230 --> 00:43:32.240 align:start position:0%
exceeded to the towns exceeded the
 
00:43:33.829 --> 00:43:33.839 align:start position:0%
town's immediate ability to address the
 
00:43:36.309 --> 00:43:36.319 align:start position:0%
situation in open roads in a separate
 
00:43:38.630 --> 00:43:38.640 align:start position:0%
community in charlestown school children
 
00:43:40.950 --> 00:43:40.960 align:start position:0%
traveled over and continued to travel
 
00:43:40.960 --> 00:43:41.910 align:start position:0%
traveled over and continued to travel
over

00:43:41.910 --> 00:43:41.920 align:start position:0%
over
 
00:43:44.309 --> 00:43:44.319 align:start position:0%
what's close to a class six road due to
 
00:43:47.030 --> 00:43:47.040 align:start position:0%
a delay in necessary repairs it struck
 
00:43:48.550 --> 00:43:48.560 align:start position:0%
me that if we could move funding to
 
00:43:50.230 --> 00:43:50.240 align:start position:0%
these communities more expediently in
 
00:43:52.230 --> 00:43:52.240 align:start position:0%
the form of a non-interest bearing loan
 
00:43:54.390 --> 00:43:54.400 align:start position:0%
a no interest loan we would
 
00:43:55.829 --> 00:43:55.839 align:start position:0%
be able to address the safety and
 
00:43:58.309 --> 00:43:58.319 align:start position:0%
economic issues presented while the f
 
00:44:00.309 --> 00:44:00.319 align:start position:0%
federal disaster relief process is
 
00:44:00.319 --> 00:44:01.510 align:start position:0%
federal disaster relief process is
underway

00:44:01.510 --> 00:44:01.520 align:start position:0%
underway
 
00:44:03.349 --> 00:44:03.359 align:start position:0%
although work has to be done to address
 
00:44:05.670 --> 00:44:05.680 align:start position:0%
this through the all the work has been
 
00:44:07.109 --> 00:44:07.119 align:start position:0%
done to address this through the
 
00:44:09.430 --> 00:44:09.440 align:start position:0%
exceptional disaster relief loans i'm
 
00:44:11.430 --> 00:44:11.440 align:start position:0%
asking to just add this one more option
 
00:44:13.990 --> 00:44:14.000 align:start position:0%
and adding this this one more option
 
00:44:16.309 --> 00:44:16.319 align:start position:0%
creates the ability and as the law is
 
00:44:18.790 --> 00:44:18.800 align:start position:0%
amended for the governor to declare a
 
00:44:21.430 --> 00:44:21.440 align:start position:0%
natural disaster and then go to governor
 
00:44:24.150 --> 00:44:24.160 align:start position:0%
and council and approve requests and
 
00:44:25.910 --> 00:44:25.920 align:start position:0%
government council would ultimately
 
00:44:27.670 --> 00:44:27.680 align:start position:0%
approve an immediate
 
00:44:29.829 --> 00:44:29.839 align:start position:0%
non-interest-bearing loan for that
 
00:44:29.839 --> 00:44:31.109 align:start position:0%
non-interest-bearing loan for that
community

00:44:31.109 --> 00:44:31.119 align:start position:0%
community
 
00:44:34.950 --> 00:44:34.960 align:start position:0%
uh and so fema disaster relief can often
 
00:44:38.230 --> 00:44:38.240 align:start position:0%
take years to be received a temporary
 
00:44:40.390 --> 00:44:40.400 align:start position:0%
emergency loan is particularly helpful
 
00:44:42.550 --> 00:44:42.560 align:start position:0%
when a disaster would financially
 
00:44:44.870 --> 00:44:44.880 align:start position:0%
overwhelm a community and require a
 
00:44:47.589 --> 00:44:47.599 align:start position:0%
large appropriation that's raised from
 
00:44:50.630 --> 00:44:50.640 align:start position:0%
local taxes
 
00:44:52.470 --> 00:44:52.480 align:start position:0%
so two more things i just want to point
 
00:44:54.630 --> 00:44:54.640 align:start position:0%
out in this is that in the senate we
 
00:44:56.870 --> 00:44:56.880 align:start position:0%
amended this original bill so you're
 
00:44:59.109 --> 00:44:59.119 align:start position:0%
seeing what's amended and in that
 
00:45:01.990 --> 00:45:02.000 align:start position:0%
amendment what we did was we clarified i
 
00:45:03.190 --> 00:45:03.200 align:start position:0%
originally had
 
00:45:05.910 --> 00:45:05.920 align:start position:0%
joint fiscal in here
 
00:45:07.990 --> 00:45:08.000 align:start position:0%
but we took joint fiscal out and went
 
00:45:09.589 --> 00:45:09.599 align:start position:0%
with the governor's request to governor
 
00:45:11.750 --> 00:45:11.760 align:start position:0%
and council to make this approval the
 
00:45:13.510 --> 00:45:13.520 align:start position:0%
second was that a community cannot
 
00:45:16.309 --> 00:45:16.319 align:start position:0%
request more than what their estimates
 
00:45:17.910 --> 00:45:17.920 align:start position:0%
with what the final request is going to
 
00:45:19.589 --> 00:45:19.599 align:start position:0%
be to fema
 
00:45:21.430 --> 00:45:21.440 align:start position:0%
and that they are responsible in
 
00:45:23.990 --> 00:45:24.000 align:start position:0%
municipality to pay the loan
 
00:45:27.510 --> 00:45:27.520 align:start position:0%
back to the state and if there is
 
00:45:29.510 --> 00:45:29.520 align:start position:0%
less received back
 
00:45:32.150 --> 00:45:32.160 align:start position:0%
to that community than what the loan was
 
00:45:32.160 --> 00:45:33.270 align:start position:0%
to that community than what the loan was
for

00:45:33.270 --> 00:45:33.280 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:45:34.870 --> 00:45:34.880 align:start position:0%
then they will work with governor and
 
00:45:37.270 --> 00:45:37.280 align:start position:0%
council and the governor's office to
 
00:45:40.550 --> 00:45:40.560 align:start position:0%
negotiate the terms of the payback
 
00:45:42.950 --> 00:45:42.960 align:start position:0%
to to the state of new hampshire
 
00:45:44.790 --> 00:45:44.800 align:start position:0%
it's been my experience i know we have
 
00:45:45.990 --> 00:45:46.000 align:start position:0%
folks from homeland security and
 
00:45:48.069 --> 00:45:48.079 align:start position:0%
emergency management here that can touch
 
00:45:50.069 --> 00:45:50.079 align:start position:0%
on this that the s the process that's
 
00:45:51.670 --> 00:45:51.680 align:start position:0%
done on estimates
 
00:45:54.230 --> 00:45:54.240 align:start position:0%
is done very well so what i'm hoping is
 
00:45:56.150 --> 00:45:56.160 align:start position:0%
not to put in a community ever in a
 
00:45:58.470 --> 00:45:58.480 align:start position:0%
position where they've borrowed more
 
00:45:58.480 --> 00:45:59.270 align:start position:0%
position where they've borrowed more
than

00:45:59.270 --> 00:45:59.280 align:start position:0%
than
 
00:46:00.870 --> 00:46:00.880 align:start position:0%
they really need but if they do there
 
00:46:02.630 --> 00:46:02.640 align:start position:0%
would be a mechanism again to negotiate
 
00:46:04.150 --> 00:46:04.160 align:start position:0%
those terms
 
00:46:06.390 --> 00:46:06.400 align:start position:0%
and as i wrap up here again i just want
 
00:46:08.390 --> 00:46:08.400 align:start position:0%
to share with you i you know i although
 
00:46:10.309 --> 00:46:10.319 align:start position:0%
i live in west lebanon new hampshire now
 
00:46:12.230 --> 00:46:12.240 align:start position:0%
i spent high representative mary nice to
 
00:46:14.710 --> 00:46:14.720 align:start position:0%
see you i spent a number of years living
 
00:46:16.390 --> 00:46:16.400 align:start position:0%
in the north country
 
00:46:18.550 --> 00:46:18.560 align:start position:0%
and have you know lived in smaller
 
00:46:20.230 --> 00:46:20.240 align:start position:0%
communities and have seen what can
 
00:46:21.750 --> 00:46:21.760 align:start position:0%
happen when a natural disaster
 
00:46:23.829 --> 00:46:23.839 align:start position:0%
overwhelms them and i want to compare
 
00:46:25.829 --> 00:46:25.839 align:start position:0%
that to my experience living in the city
 
00:46:27.589 --> 00:46:27.599 align:start position:0%
of lebanon and being a city councilor
 
00:46:29.670 --> 00:46:29.680 align:start position:0%
there when we had a micro burst that
 
00:46:31.750 --> 00:46:31.760 align:start position:0%
wiped out an entire road
 
00:46:33.990 --> 00:46:34.000 align:start position:0%
side basically an entire part of the
 
00:46:35.910 --> 00:46:35.920 align:start position:0%
neighborhood had no connection to the
 
00:46:38.430 --> 00:46:38.440 align:start position:0%
main part of our city and it was a
 
00:46:41.670 --> 00:46:41.680 align:start position:0%
multi-million dollar um as you know
 
00:46:43.430 --> 00:46:43.440 align:start position:0%
repairs that needed to be made and it
 
00:46:46.950 --> 00:46:46.960 align:start position:0%
was a huge safety issue we have um it
 
00:46:48.630 --> 00:46:48.640 align:start position:0%
doesn't make us better or smarter but we
 
00:46:51.270 --> 00:46:51.280 align:start position:0%
had more money set aside in
 
00:46:52.950 --> 00:46:52.960 align:start position:0%
you know in our rainy day fund pardon
 
00:46:56.309 --> 00:46:56.319 align:start position:0%
the pun we had a larger population and
 
00:46:57.670 --> 00:46:57.680 align:start position:0%
we were able to take from our own
 
00:47:00.309 --> 00:47:00.319 align:start position:0%
coffers to make the immediate repairs so
 
00:47:01.829 --> 00:47:01.839 align:start position:0%
that people could actually drive up and
 
00:47:03.430 --> 00:47:03.440 align:start position:0%
down their roads and be safe and have
 
00:47:05.349 --> 00:47:05.359 align:start position:0%
water at their houses while we went
 
00:47:07.190 --> 00:47:07.200 align:start position:0%
through the fema process
 
00:47:10.230 --> 00:47:10.240 align:start position:0%
so that and when fema paid us back you
 
00:47:11.750 --> 00:47:11.760 align:start position:0%
know we paid our you know we paid
 
00:47:13.910 --> 00:47:13.920 align:start position:0%
ourselves back smaller communities are
 
00:47:15.829 --> 00:47:15.839 align:start position:0%
not always in this position and i just
 
00:47:17.270 --> 00:47:17.280 align:start position:0%
think it's important that we recognize
 
00:47:19.430 --> 00:47:19.440 align:start position:0%
that and try to provide a mechanism for
 
00:47:19.440 --> 00:47:20.230 align:start position:0%
that and try to provide a mechanism for
them

00:47:20.230 --> 00:47:20.240 align:start position:0%
them
 
00:47:21.829 --> 00:47:21.839 align:start position:0%
to really help themselves and their
 
00:47:24.390 --> 00:47:24.400 align:start position:0%
residents be safe support their
 
00:47:26.549 --> 00:47:26.559 align:start position:0%
businesses their school children and so
 
00:47:28.950 --> 00:47:28.960 align:start position:0%
on during these really tough times i'm
 
00:47:31.349 --> 00:47:31.359 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions you have
 
00:47:32.710 --> 00:47:32.720 align:start position:0%
and if i don't have the answer i'll
 
00:47:34.069 --> 00:47:34.079 align:start position:0%
certainly get back to you and thank you
 
00:47:35.670 --> 00:47:35.680 align:start position:0%

thank you senator prentice are there any
questions

00:47:39.109 --> 00:47:39.119 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:47:41.990 --> 00:47:42.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:43.190 --> 00:47:43.200 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:47:44.549 --> 00:47:44.559 align:start position:0%
madam chairman thank you senator
 
00:47:46.710 --> 00:47:46.720 align:start position:0%
prentice it's so nice to see you here my
 
00:47:46.720 --> 00:47:47.910 align:start position:0%
prentice it's so nice to see you here my
question

00:47:47.910 --> 00:47:47.920 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:47:51.430 --> 00:47:51.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:55.589 --> 00:47:55.599 align:start position:0%
governor and council um within this bill
 
00:47:57.270 --> 00:47:57.280 align:start position:0%
if and when i listened to what happened
 
00:48:00.630 --> 00:48:00.640 align:start position:0%
to at birth it was just so
 
00:48:02.790 --> 00:48:02.800 align:start position:0%
horrible and they needed immediate help
 
00:48:05.030 --> 00:48:05.040 align:start position:0%
right away um and governor council only
 
00:48:06.549 --> 00:48:06.559 align:start position:0%
meets every two weeks
 
00:48:09.349 --> 00:48:09.359 align:start position:0%
will with this bill give authority to
 
00:48:12.390 --> 00:48:12.400 align:start position:0%
the governor in council to poll them
 
00:48:12.400 --> 00:48:13.589 align:start position:0%
the governor in council to poll them
remotely

00:48:13.589 --> 00:48:13.599 align:start position:0%
remotely
 
00:48:15.910 --> 00:48:15.920 align:start position:0%
to get permission to begin the process
 
00:48:18.790 --> 00:48:18.800 align:start position:0%
almost immediately or do they have to go
 
00:48:21.270 --> 00:48:21.280 align:start position:0%
through the every two weeks
 
00:48:22.230 --> 00:48:22.240 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
00:48:23.510 --> 00:48:23.520 align:start position:0%
representative heath and it's good to
 
00:48:25.349 --> 00:48:25.359 align:start position:0%
see you today as well
 
00:48:27.829 --> 00:48:27.839 align:start position:0%
it would not allow for any
 
00:48:27.839 --> 00:48:28.870 align:start position:0%
it would not allow for any
polling

00:48:28.870 --> 00:48:28.880 align:start position:0%
polling
 
00:48:31.270 --> 00:48:31.280 align:start position:0%
immediately i'm sure that as is with
 
00:48:33.430 --> 00:48:33.440 align:start position:0%
news like this it does travel fast and
 
00:48:33.440 --> 00:48:34.950 align:start position:0%
news like this it does travel fast and
counselors

00:48:34.950 --> 00:48:34.960 align:start position:0%
counselors
 
00:48:37.190 --> 00:48:37.200 align:start position:0%
are prepared you know to address the
 
00:48:39.349 --> 00:48:39.359 align:start position:0%
issue and i think the good news about
 
00:48:41.670 --> 00:48:41.680 align:start position:0%
governor council is that they do meet
 
00:48:43.030 --> 00:48:43.040 align:start position:0%
twice a month
 
00:48:44.549 --> 00:48:44.559 align:start position:0%
and which is
 
00:48:46.870 --> 00:48:46.880 align:start position:0%
again puts us on a faster track than
 
00:48:48.790 --> 00:48:48.800 align:start position:0%
where we currently are today so i hope
 
00:48:52.150 --> 00:48:52.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:53.829 --> 00:48:53.839 align:start position:0%
representative leitchman
 
00:48:55.670 --> 00:48:55.680 align:start position:0%
thanks madam chair uh thanks for
 
00:48:57.990 --> 00:48:58.000 align:start position:0%
appearing how are you good how are you
 
00:48:59.589 --> 00:48:59.599 align:start position:0%
so i'd like to take it a little further
 
00:49:01.910 --> 00:49:01.920 align:start position:0%
as far as your no interest loans and
 
00:49:03.510 --> 00:49:03.520 align:start position:0%
trying to protect the smaller
 
00:49:03.520 --> 00:49:04.710 align:start position:0%
trying to protect the smaller
communities

00:49:04.710 --> 00:49:04.720 align:start position:0%
communities
 
00:49:07.349 --> 00:49:07.359 align:start position:0%
was there consideration of just grants
 
00:49:09.430 --> 00:49:09.440 align:start position:0%
within your legislation so these small
 
00:49:11.270 --> 00:49:11.280 align:start position:0%
communities like acworth would not be
 
00:49:14.150 --> 00:49:14.160 align:start position:0%
responsible for paying back these
 
00:49:15.750 --> 00:49:15.760 align:start position:0%
so-called loans even though they're
 
00:49:17.829 --> 00:49:17.839 align:start position:0%
interest-free as you've said but
 
00:49:20.470 --> 00:49:20.480 align:start position:0%
wouldn't it be more
 
00:49:23.910 --> 00:49:23.920 align:start position:0%
they were just strictly grants
 
00:49:27.349 --> 00:49:27.359 align:start position:0%
the um manager and representatives
 
00:49:29.349 --> 00:49:29.359 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question so keep in
 
00:49:31.430 --> 00:49:31.440 align:start position:0%
mind that they're going to borrow this
 
00:49:33.109 --> 00:49:33.119 align:start position:0%
money from the state and then they're
 
00:49:35.270 --> 00:49:35.280 align:start position:0%
going to get reimbursed by fema so
 
00:49:37.030 --> 00:49:37.040 align:start position:0%
they're going to get that money back and
 
00:49:40.150 --> 00:49:40.160 align:start position:0%
then they need to pay the state back
 
00:49:41.990 --> 00:49:42.000 align:start position:0%
so that is the structure of it the only
 
00:49:45.430 --> 00:49:45.440 align:start position:0%
time we could get into muddy water is if
 
00:49:45.440 --> 00:49:46.230 align:start position:0%
time we could get into muddy water is if
the

00:49:46.230 --> 00:49:46.240 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:49:49.990 --> 00:49:50.000 align:start position:0%
for some reason they got less from fema
 
00:49:51.910 --> 00:49:51.920 align:start position:0%
than what they have borrowed and it
 
00:49:53.750 --> 00:49:53.760 align:start position:0%
provides again language in here so there
 
00:49:56.390 --> 00:49:56.400 align:start position:0%
could be a negotiation
 
00:49:58.630 --> 00:49:58.640 align:start position:0%
okay so they so they're not it's not a
 
00:49:59.750 --> 00:49:59.760 align:start position:0%
loan that they don't you know they're
 
00:50:01.589 --> 00:50:01.599 align:start position:0%
going to get money from they will get
 
00:50:04.150 --> 00:50:04.160 align:start position:0%
money from fema to pay back the loan
 
00:50:07.349 --> 00:50:07.359 align:start position:0%
thanks thanks venom chair you're welcome
 
00:50:09.829 --> 00:50:09.839 align:start position:0%
representative mooney
 
00:50:11.430 --> 00:50:11.440 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you senator
 
00:50:14.150 --> 00:50:14.160 align:start position:0%
for being here thank you i last night
 
00:50:17.349 --> 00:50:17.359 align:start position:0%
pulled house bill 1665
 
00:50:20.069 --> 00:50:20.079 align:start position:0%
which came to this committee recently

uh if perhaps you or maybe she could
 
00:50:31.990 --> 00:50:32.000 align:start position:0%
answer if there could be a marriage
 
00:50:35.910 --> 00:50:35.920 align:start position:0%
between your bill and this bill
 
00:50:36.710 --> 00:50:36.720 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
00:50:38.829 --> 00:50:38.839 align:start position:0%
representative mooney is this uh

we both have um
 
00:50:48.230 --> 00:50:48.240 align:start position:0%
if you're if you're comfortable a common
 
00:50:51.190 --> 00:50:51.200 align:start position:0%
goal in solving this problem so if
 
00:50:52.470 --> 00:50:52.480 align:start position:0%
that's what we need to do then that's
 
00:50:53.990 --> 00:50:54.000 align:start position:0%
what we need to do and i'm happy to work
 
00:50:58.230 --> 00:50:58.240 align:start position:0%
with representative aaron okay thank you
 
00:50:59.910 --> 00:50:59.920 align:start position:0%
representative lynn
 
00:51:01.589 --> 00:51:01.599 align:start position:0%
yes thank you and i'm sure thanks for
 
00:51:04.390 --> 00:51:04.400 align:start position:0%
taking my question uh i just wanna with
 
00:51:07.510 --> 00:51:07.520 align:start position:0%
regard to subsection d
 
00:51:09.510 --> 00:51:09.520 align:start position:0%
about about negotiation in other words
 
00:51:10.470 --> 00:51:10.480 align:start position:0%
if the
 
00:51:12.470 --> 00:51:12.480 align:start position:0%
if the amount of the fema
 
00:51:15.430 --> 00:51:15.440 align:start position:0%
uh money is less than the amount of the
 
00:51:17.670 --> 00:51:17.680 align:start position:0%
no interest loan
 
00:51:20.309 --> 00:51:20.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:22.790 --> 00:51:22.800 align:start position:0%
shall negotiate repayment terms of the
 
00:51:25.670 --> 00:51:25.680 align:start position:0%
difference do i should i understand
 
00:51:25.680 --> 00:51:26.790 align:start position:0%
difference do i should i understand
the

00:51:26.790 --> 00:51:26.800 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:51:28.549 --> 00:51:28.559 align:start position:0%
that language to mean
 
00:51:31.270 --> 00:51:31.280 align:start position:0%
that there is an obligation to repay
 
00:51:33.270 --> 00:51:33.280 align:start position:0%
there's no question that the that the
 
00:51:36.150 --> 00:51:36.160 align:start position:0%
municipality has to repay the loan the
 
00:51:38.630 --> 00:51:38.640 align:start position:0%
only question for negotiation is
 
00:51:40.710 --> 00:51:40.720 align:start position:0%
for example over what period of time
 
00:51:43.430 --> 00:51:43.440 align:start position:0%
what interest right rate might apply
 
00:51:44.870 --> 00:51:44.880 align:start position:0%
or is it
 
00:51:44.880 --> 00:51:45.829 align:start position:0%
or is it
that

00:51:45.829 --> 00:51:45.839 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:51:47.510 --> 00:51:47.520 align:start position:0%
maybe they don't have to repay the loan
 
00:51:49.190 --> 00:51:49.200 align:start position:0%
or they don't have to repay all of it
 
00:51:50.870 --> 00:51:50.880 align:start position:0%
and that's supposed to be the subject of
 
00:51:50.880 --> 00:51:52.790 align:start position:0%
and that's supposed to be the subject of
negotiation

00:51:52.790 --> 00:51:52.800 align:start position:0%
negotiation
 
00:51:54.069 --> 00:51:54.079 align:start position:0%
representative lin thank you for the
 
00:51:57.190 --> 00:51:57.200 align:start position:0%
question so i think the way that i read
 
00:51:59.750 --> 00:51:59.760 align:start position:0%
this and in my thinking is that
 
00:51:59.760 --> 00:52:01.190 align:start position:0%
this and in my thinking is that
negotiation

00:52:01.190 --> 00:52:01.200 align:start position:0%
negotiation
 
00:52:04.549 --> 00:52:04.559 align:start position:0%
includes the potential for a forgiveness
 
00:52:06.710 --> 00:52:06.720 align:start position:0%
depending on the size again i'd like to
 
00:52:08.630 --> 00:52:08.640 align:start position:0%
think that our size of the amount i like
 
00:52:10.230 --> 00:52:10.240 align:start position:0%
to think that our estimates based on my
 
00:52:12.870 --> 00:52:12.880 align:start position:0%
experience that come from fema and what
 
00:52:14.710 --> 00:52:14.720 align:start position:0%
is actually you know is going to be
 
00:52:15.910 --> 00:52:15.920 align:start position:0%
borrowed here
 
00:52:18.470 --> 00:52:18.480 align:start position:0%
should be should be down to the penny
 
00:52:19.829 --> 00:52:19.839 align:start position:0%
but if
 
00:52:20.950 --> 00:52:20.960 align:start position:0%
i would leave that to governor and
 
00:52:22.790 --> 00:52:22.800 align:start position:0%
council to make that decision on what
 
00:52:24.230 --> 00:52:24.240 align:start position:0%
negotiation is because they're
 
00:52:25.829 --> 00:52:25.839 align:start position:0%
ultimately going to do it
 
00:52:27.270 --> 00:52:27.280 align:start position:0%
right follow-up
 
00:52:29.510 --> 00:52:29.520 align:start position:0%
follow-up so i guess my own
 
00:52:30.870 --> 00:52:30.880 align:start position:0%
please understand i'm completely
 
00:52:33.109 --> 00:52:33.119 align:start position:0%
supportive of this bill but but i i
 
00:52:34.950 --> 00:52:34.960 align:start position:0%
guess what i'm wondering is
 
00:52:36.309 --> 00:52:36.319 align:start position:0%
you know when you say they will
 
00:52:38.950 --> 00:52:38.960 align:start position:0%
negotiate okay they'll negotiate suppose
 
00:52:41.270 --> 00:52:41.280 align:start position:0%
they don't come to a decision and it
 
00:52:43.750 --> 00:52:43.760 align:start position:0%
goes to court because they can't agree
 
00:52:46.309 --> 00:52:46.319 align:start position:0%
what does the court do what's the law
 
00:52:48.069 --> 00:52:48.079 align:start position:0%
they have to negotiate what is that what
 
00:52:49.829 --> 00:52:49.839 align:start position:0%
does that mean they've negotiated they
 
00:52:50.710 --> 00:52:50.720 align:start position:0%
haven't been able to come to an
 
00:52:52.309 --> 00:52:52.319 align:start position:0%
agreement what does the
 
00:52:54.549 --> 00:52:54.559 align:start position:0%
what what's the law in terms of whether
 
00:52:55.990 --> 00:52:56.000 align:start position:0%
the court
 
00:52:57.750 --> 00:52:57.760 align:start position:0%
you know record what what does the court
 
00:52:59.510 --> 00:52:59.520 align:start position:0%
say well you do have to pay it all back
 
00:53:01.829 --> 00:53:01.839 align:start position:0%
or you don't or
 
00:53:03.910 --> 00:53:03.920 align:start position:0%
that's that's the thing that i see as
 
00:53:05.750 --> 00:53:05.760 align:start position:0%
sort of a problem i understand and
 
00:53:07.750 --> 00:53:07.760 align:start position:0%
you're i represent when you're certainly
 
00:53:10.230 --> 00:53:10.240 align:start position:0%
uh you know have outpaced me and
 
00:53:12.549 --> 00:53:12.559 align:start position:0%
experience on the judicial side as i'm
 
00:53:15.190 --> 00:53:15.200 align:start position:0%
i'm aware but i um
 
00:53:16.549 --> 00:53:16.559 align:start position:0%
i'd have to think about that i mean if
 
00:53:17.750 --> 00:53:17.760 align:start position:0%
this went to
 
00:53:19.990 --> 00:53:20.000 align:start position:0%
a court if if the law says it's a
 
00:53:21.829 --> 00:53:21.839 align:start position:0%
negotiation and again i don't have the
 
00:53:23.990 --> 00:53:24.000 align:start position:0%
judicial experience you are between
 
00:53:26.150 --> 00:53:26.160 align:start position:0%
governor council and that community they
 
00:53:27.589 --> 00:53:27.599 align:start position:0%
could ultimately turn around and push
 
00:53:29.750 --> 00:53:29.760 align:start position:0%
the decision back to governor council in
 
00:53:31.750 --> 00:53:31.760 align:start position:0%
the community to make that decision or
 
00:53:33.750 --> 00:53:33.760 align:start position:0%
they could rule i can't say what a what
 
00:53:36.069 --> 00:53:36.079 align:start position:0%
a court may or may not do but i think
 
00:53:38.230 --> 00:53:38.240 align:start position:0%
that you're i understand your concern i
 
00:53:40.829 --> 00:53:40.839 align:start position:0%
want to be clear thank you you're
 
00:53:44.870 --> 00:53:44.880 align:start position:0%
welcome representative wyler
 
00:53:46.150 --> 00:53:46.160 align:start position:0%
i'm also
 
00:53:47.829 --> 00:53:47.839 align:start position:0%
uh shocked by this
 
00:53:49.670 --> 00:53:49.680 align:start position:0%
pay it all back because
 
00:53:52.150 --> 00:53:52.160 align:start position:0%
the way it generally works is you know
 
00:53:54.470 --> 00:53:54.480 align:start position:0%
it comes years later but
 
00:53:57.349 --> 00:53:57.359 align:start position:0%
fema will pay like 75
 
00:53:59.990 --> 00:54:00.000 align:start position:0%
and then the town or the state
 
00:54:02.950 --> 00:54:02.960 align:start position:0%
will split up the other 25
 
00:54:05.589 --> 00:54:05.599 align:start position:0%
sometimes to the advantage of the town
 
00:54:07.589 --> 00:54:07.599 align:start position:0%
sometimes not sometimes they expect to
 
00:54:09.750 --> 00:54:09.760 align:start position:0%
split that 25
 
00:54:09.760 --> 00:54:10.710 align:start position:0%
split that 25
so

00:54:10.710 --> 00:54:10.720 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:54:12.630 --> 00:54:12.640 align:start position:0%
i've seen cases where the state takes a
 
00:54:14.549 --> 00:54:14.559 align:start position:0%
bigger share than the town
 
00:54:17.190 --> 00:54:17.200 align:start position:0%
that could still apply but that's might
 
00:54:19.670 --> 00:54:19.680 align:start position:0%
be the negotiation in this situation
 
00:54:20.870 --> 00:54:20.880 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:54:22.230 --> 00:54:22.240 align:start position:0%
thank you representative weiler i know
 
00:54:24.870 --> 00:54:24.880 align:start position:0%
it's not a question but i do want to
 
00:54:24.880 --> 00:54:25.829 align:start position:0%
it's not a question but i do want to
again

00:54:25.829 --> 00:54:25.839 align:start position:0%
again
 
00:54:27.349 --> 00:54:27.359 align:start position:0%
just point out that we do have homeland
 
00:54:28.790 --> 00:54:28.800 align:start position:0%
security and emergency management in the
 
00:54:30.549 --> 00:54:30.559 align:start position:0%
room and they'll speak to
 
00:54:32.309 --> 00:54:32.319 align:start position:0%
there's a process for this that's
 
00:54:34.309 --> 00:54:34.319 align:start position:0%
already in place in terms of
 
00:54:36.549 --> 00:54:36.559 align:start position:0%
the applications and how the the paying
 
00:54:38.390 --> 00:54:38.400 align:start position:0%
back and the percentage goes so
 
00:54:39.589 --> 00:54:39.599 align:start position:0%
we'd be sure if you have questions we
 
00:54:41.109 --> 00:54:41.119 align:start position:0%
can address that with home and security
 
00:54:43.349 --> 00:54:43.359 align:start position:0%
and emergency management thank you
 
00:54:45.109 --> 00:54:45.119 align:start position:0%
representative petry
 
00:54:46.309 --> 00:54:46.319 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you for
 
00:54:47.670 --> 00:54:47.680 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
00:54:47.680 --> 00:54:49.589 align:start position:0%
taking my question
um

00:54:49.589 --> 00:54:49.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:54:51.990 --> 00:54:52.000 align:start position:0%
have you checked into uh similar things
 
00:54:53.589 --> 00:54:53.599 align:start position:0%
like tan notes
 
00:54:56.630 --> 00:54:56.640 align:start position:0%
text tax anticipation notes
 
00:54:58.630 --> 00:54:58.640 align:start position:0%
because it seems so we could apply the
 
00:54:58.640 --> 00:55:00.390 align:start position:0%
because it seems so we could apply the
same

00:55:00.390 --> 00:55:00.400 align:start position:0%
same
 
00:55:00.400 --> 00:55:02.549 align:start position:0%
same
process

00:55:02.549 --> 00:55:02.559 align:start position:0%
process
 
00:55:05.030 --> 00:55:05.040 align:start position:0%
you know in other words we we do it at
 
00:55:07.109 --> 00:55:07.119 align:start position:0%
the county all the time we borrow money
 
00:55:09.109 --> 00:55:09.119 align:start position:0%
to to survive the
 
00:55:11.430 --> 00:55:11.440 align:start position:0%
you know because we don't get funded
 
00:55:14.390 --> 00:55:14.400 align:start position:0%
uh into the budget process
 
00:55:16.150 --> 00:55:16.160 align:start position:0%
so have you checked into that at all
 
00:55:18.870 --> 00:55:18.880 align:start position:0%
because tech it would seem to solve the
 
00:55:21.270 --> 00:55:21.280 align:start position:0%
problem because you you're anticipating
 
00:55:23.109 --> 00:55:23.119 align:start position:0%
money from fema
 
00:55:24.630 --> 00:55:24.640 align:start position:0%
possibly the state
 
00:55:25.990 --> 00:55:26.000 align:start position:0%
and then
 
00:55:27.990 --> 00:55:28.000 align:start position:0%
the rest of the share of the of the
 
00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:29.990 align:start position:0%
the rest of the share of the of the
municipality

00:55:29.990 --> 00:55:30.000 align:start position:0%
municipality
 
00:55:33.109 --> 00:55:33.119 align:start position:0%
thank you um representative petrie no i
 
00:55:35.750 --> 00:55:35.760 align:start position:0%
um frankly i have not looked into tax
 
00:55:37.910 --> 00:55:37.920 align:start position:0%
anticipation notes but i would be happy
 
00:55:39.750 --> 00:55:39.760 align:start position:0%
to do that i mean you know i brought my
 
00:55:42.630 --> 00:55:42.640 align:start position:0%
laptop if i may follow up if it's not
 
00:55:45.750 --> 00:55:45.760 align:start position:0%
you know it's tax anticipation but it
 
00:55:48.789 --> 00:55:48.799 align:start position:0%
could follow the same logic
 
00:55:48.799 --> 00:55:51.349 align:start position:0%
could follow the same logic
okay

00:55:51.349 --> 00:55:51.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:53.309 --> 00:55:53.319 align:start position:0%
are there any further questions
 
00:55:55.589 --> 00:55:55.599 align:start position:0%
representative thank you madam chair
 
00:55:58.390 --> 00:55:58.400 align:start position:0%
thank you senator um
 
00:55:59.990 --> 00:56:00.000 align:start position:0%
this may be a better question for the
 
00:56:02.309 --> 00:56:02.319 align:start position:0%
fema people later but on line seven when
 
00:56:05.910 --> 00:56:05.920 align:start position:0%
it talks about the anticipated assistant
 
00:56:09.349 --> 00:56:09.359 align:start position:0%
my concern is we have a floor
 
00:56:11.109 --> 00:56:11.119 align:start position:0%
outlined in
 
00:56:13.430 --> 00:56:13.440 align:start position:0%
lines nine through 11
 
00:56:16.470 --> 00:56:16.480 align:start position:0%
on on the amount 25 of the amount raised
 
00:56:19.510 --> 00:56:19.520 align:start position:0%
by local property taxes blah blah blah
 
00:56:22.470 --> 00:56:22.480 align:start position:0%
my concern is the the top end of that
 
00:56:24.309 --> 00:56:24.319 align:start position:0%
what that loan might be
 
00:56:25.670 --> 00:56:25.680 align:start position:0%
and that kind of brings us back to i
 
00:56:27.470 --> 00:56:27.480 align:start position:0%
think line seven where it talks about
 
00:56:30.069 --> 00:56:30.079 align:start position:0%
anticipated assistance and my question
 
00:56:33.270 --> 00:56:33.280 align:start position:0%
is how is that anticipated assistance
 
00:56:33.280 --> 00:56:36.789 align:start position:0%
is how is that anticipated assistance
determined

00:56:36.789 --> 00:56:36.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:37.750 --> 00:56:37.760 align:start position:0%
so i
 
00:56:38.549 --> 00:56:38.559 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
00:56:39.910 --> 00:56:39.920 align:start position:0%
representative turcotte i'm going to
 
00:56:42.390 --> 00:56:42.400 align:start position:0%
defer a majority of this to our
 
00:56:45.030 --> 00:56:45.040 align:start position:0%
to our state agency but i think the the
 
00:56:47.750 --> 00:56:47.760 align:start position:0%
fema estimation process that they go
 
00:56:47.760 --> 00:56:48.470 align:start position:0%
fema estimation process that they go
through

00:56:48.470 --> 00:56:48.480 align:start position:0%
through
 
00:56:50.230 --> 00:56:50.240 align:start position:0%
to make a determination about the damage
 
00:56:52.309 --> 00:56:52.319 align:start position:0%
that's been done will
 
00:56:54.549 --> 00:56:54.559 align:start position:0%
align with the anticipation but let's
 
00:56:56.470 --> 00:56:56.480 align:start position:0%
hold and clarify there and thank you
 
00:56:59.589 --> 00:56:59.599 align:start position:0%
great thank you uh i do have one oh
 
00:57:02.230 --> 00:57:02.240 align:start position:0%
sorry i'll rip some irf
 
00:57:03.829 --> 00:57:03.839 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you madam chair and
 
00:57:03.839 --> 00:57:05.190 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you madam chair and
senator

00:57:05.190 --> 00:57:05.200 align:start position:0%
senator
 
00:57:07.430 --> 00:57:07.440 align:start position:0%
is there significance to the change of
 
00:57:10.390 --> 00:57:10.400 align:start position:0%
the word occurrence to incident
 
00:57:12.950 --> 00:57:12.960 align:start position:0%
on lines nine and ten
 
00:57:14.950 --> 00:57:14.960 align:start position:0%
that was an amendment that was made in
 
00:57:17.910 --> 00:57:17.920 align:start position:0%
the finance committee of the senate um
 
00:57:20.789 --> 00:57:20.799 align:start position:0%
and they just wanted to make sure um
 
00:57:23.430 --> 00:57:23.440 align:start position:0%
that it was it was more all-encompassing
 
00:57:26.950 --> 00:57:26.960 align:start position:0%
in case there were multiple occurrences
 
00:57:29.990 --> 00:57:30.000 align:start position:0%
they preferred that language
 
00:57:31.829 --> 00:57:31.839 align:start position:0%
so an occurrence is not an incident or
 
00:57:33.829 --> 00:57:33.839 align:start position:0%
vice versa
 
00:57:35.109 --> 00:57:35.119 align:start position:0%
so there could be an incident and there
 
00:57:36.710 --> 00:57:36.720 align:start position:0%
could be multiple occurrences within an
 
00:57:36.720 --> 00:57:37.670 align:start position:0%
could be multiple occurrences within an
incident

00:57:37.670 --> 00:57:37.680 align:start position:0%
incident
 
00:57:39.430 --> 00:57:39.440 align:start position:0%
from different parts of a community so
 
00:57:42.150 --> 00:57:42.160 align:start position:0%
that um same community
 
00:57:44.230 --> 00:57:44.240 align:start position:0%
different problems so that um and you
 
00:57:45.589 --> 00:57:45.599 align:start position:0%
know that's the policy statement i don't
 
00:57:47.270 --> 00:57:47.280 align:start position:0%
disagree with it i was happy to take
 
00:57:54.309 --> 00:57:54.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:58.069 --> 00:57:58.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:59.510 --> 00:57:59.520 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much for your
 
00:58:01.750 --> 00:58:01.760 align:start position:0%
testimony thank you everybody
 
00:58:09.349 --> 00:58:09.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:11.030 --> 00:58:11.040 align:start position:0%
next person will call on representative
 
00:58:11.040 --> 00:58:20.870 align:start position:0%
next person will call on representative
aaron

00:58:20.870 --> 00:58:20.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:22.950 --> 00:58:22.960 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you committee
 
00:58:25.030 --> 00:58:25.040 align:start position:0%
for hearing me today for the record my
 
00:58:27.270 --> 00:58:27.280 align:start position:0%
name is representative judy aaron
 
00:58:29.190 --> 00:58:29.200 align:start position:0%
i represent sullivan county district
 
00:58:31.589 --> 00:58:31.599 align:start position:0%
seven which is acworth goshen langdon
 
00:58:35.190 --> 00:58:35.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:37.349 --> 00:58:37.359 align:start position:0%
and i come to you today in support of
 
00:58:37.359 --> 00:58:38.390 align:start position:0%
and i come to you today in support of
this

00:58:38.390 --> 00:58:38.400 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:58:41.349 --> 00:58:41.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:43.589 --> 00:58:43.599 align:start position:0%
i believe that it
 
00:58:46.150 --> 00:58:46.160 align:start position:0%
certainly makes some
 
00:58:48.630 --> 00:58:48.640 align:start position:0%
positive marginal change to current
 
00:58:48.640 --> 00:58:51.270 align:start position:0%
positive marginal change to current
statute

00:58:51.270 --> 00:58:51.280 align:start position:0%
statute
 
00:58:53.670 --> 00:58:53.680 align:start position:0%
living in acworth
 
00:58:56.710 --> 00:58:56.720 align:start position:0%
and having to deal with the
 
00:58:59.910 --> 00:58:59.920 align:start position:0%
massive damage that happened to our town
 
00:59:02.630 --> 00:59:02.640 align:start position:0%
this past july 29th
 
00:59:05.109 --> 00:59:05.119 align:start position:0%
i have to tell you that current statute
 
00:59:05.119 --> 00:59:06.549 align:start position:0%
i have to tell you that current statute
really

00:59:06.549 --> 00:59:06.559 align:start position:0%
really
 
00:59:09.430 --> 00:59:09.440 align:start position:0%
was useless for us
 
00:59:11.910 --> 00:59:11.920 align:start position:0%
we were in desperate need of immediate
 
00:59:11.920 --> 00:59:13.190 align:start position:0%
we were in desperate need of immediate
help

00:59:13.190 --> 00:59:13.200 align:start position:0%
help
 
00:59:15.670 --> 00:59:15.680 align:start position:0%
and the statute currently didn't do
 
00:59:17.750 --> 00:59:17.760 align:start position:0%
anything for us
 
00:59:17.760 --> 00:59:19.349 align:start position:0%
anything for us
because

00:59:19.349 --> 00:59:19.359 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:59:21.190 --> 00:59:21.200 align:start position:0%
it wasn't until maybe three or four
 
00:59:24.630 --> 00:59:24.640 align:start position:0%
months after the event happened
 
00:59:26.069 --> 00:59:26.079 align:start position:0%
that there was a presidential
 
00:59:29.270 --> 00:59:29.280 align:start position:0%
declaration of emergency
 
00:59:29.280 --> 00:59:30.150 align:start position:0%
declaration of emergency
and

00:59:30.150 --> 00:59:30.160 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:59:32.710 --> 00:59:32.720 align:start position:0%
of course when
 
00:59:35.109 --> 00:59:35.119 align:start position:0%
a horrific event like this happens to
 
00:59:36.470 --> 00:59:36.480 align:start position:0%
your town
 
00:59:38.309 --> 00:59:38.319 align:start position:0%
you can't wait three or four months to
 
00:59:40.309 --> 00:59:40.319 align:start position:0%
reopen roads and get people to their
 
00:59:41.510 --> 00:59:41.520 align:start position:0%
homes and
 
00:59:43.349 --> 00:59:43.359 align:start position:0%
be able to get emergency vehicles
 
00:59:43.359 --> 00:59:44.390 align:start position:0%
be able to get emergency vehicles
through

00:59:44.390 --> 00:59:44.400 align:start position:0%
through
 
00:59:46.470 --> 00:59:46.480 align:start position:0%
you can't even
 
00:59:49.270 --> 00:59:49.280 align:start position:0%
do a proper rfp
 
00:59:51.510 --> 00:59:51.520 align:start position:0%
to have you know things go out to bid
 
00:59:55.270 --> 00:59:55.280 align:start position:0%
you have to grab whoever is available
 
00:59:59.430 --> 00:59:59.440 align:start position:0%
to get roads fixed and passable and safe
 
01:00:02.069 --> 01:00:02.079 align:start position:0%
to be able to get to utility poles
 
01:00:05.109 --> 01:00:05.119 align:start position:0%
that are damaged to be able to
 
01:00:07.030 --> 01:00:07.040 align:start position:0%
have farmers be able to get to their
 
01:00:07.040 --> 01:00:08.549 align:start position:0%
have farmers be able to get to their
fields

01:00:08.549 --> 01:00:08.559 align:start position:0%
fields
 
01:00:11.589 --> 01:00:11.599 align:start position:0%
we were in a situation where all hands
 
01:00:12.950 --> 01:00:12.960 align:start position:0%
were on deck
 
01:00:14.470 --> 01:00:14.480 align:start position:0%
you couldn't wait
 
01:00:16.950 --> 01:00:16.960 align:start position:0%
for the state you couldn't wait for the
 
01:00:19.109 --> 01:00:19.119 align:start position:0%
federal government
 
01:00:20.789 --> 01:00:20.799 align:start position:0%
and that was the position that we were
 
01:00:20.799 --> 01:00:23.750 align:start position:0%
and that was the position that we were
in

01:00:23.750 --> 01:00:23.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:26.470 --> 01:00:26.480 align:start position:0%
and i have to say
 
01:00:28.710 --> 01:00:28.720 align:start position:0%
even with the prospect
 
01:00:28.720 --> 01:00:30.789 align:start position:0%
even with the prospect
of

01:00:30.789 --> 01:00:30.799 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:00:30.799 --> 01:00:32.230 align:start position:0%
of
having

01:00:32.230 --> 01:00:32.240 align:start position:0%
having
 
01:00:35.829 --> 01:00:35.839 align:start position:0%
being able to get a loan from the state
 
01:00:38.309 --> 01:00:38.319 align:start position:0%
that was not an option for us at the
 
01:00:40.950 --> 01:00:40.960 align:start position:0%
time because there was no guarantee we
 
01:00:42.390 --> 01:00:42.400 align:start position:0%
were told
 
01:00:44.710 --> 01:00:44.720 align:start position:0%
that oh you can apply for for a loan
 
01:00:46.549 --> 01:00:46.559 align:start position:0%
from the state and this was after the
 
01:00:48.870 --> 01:00:48.880 align:start position:0%
emergency declaration
 
01:00:51.349 --> 01:00:51.359 align:start position:0%
became available
 
01:00:54.150 --> 01:00:54.160 align:start position:0%
but that process would take maybe three
 
01:00:56.789 --> 01:00:56.799 align:start position:0%
to six months and we don't know whether
 
01:00:57.750 --> 01:00:57.760 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:00:59.349 --> 01:00:59.359 align:start position:0%
whether you apply for it you're going to
 
01:01:01.030 --> 01:01:01.040 align:start position:0%
get granted the money
 
01:01:03.670 --> 01:01:03.680 align:start position:0%
so with no assurances at all
 
01:01:06.069 --> 01:01:06.079 align:start position:0%
the only thing that acworth
 
01:01:08.470 --> 01:01:08.480 align:start position:0%
had as an option at the time
 
01:01:10.309 --> 01:01:10.319 align:start position:0%
once we were scrambling around trying to
 
01:01:12.789 --> 01:01:12.799 align:start position:0%
get everything reopened
 
01:01:15.589 --> 01:01:15.599 align:start position:0%
was to go to a local bank muscoma bank
 
01:01:19.670 --> 01:01:19.680 align:start position:0%
and we got a 2.1 million dollar loan
 
01:01:21.910 --> 01:01:21.920 align:start position:0%
yeah we could have come to the state
 
01:01:24.309 --> 01:01:24.319 align:start position:0%
but we had no assurance at all whether
 
01:01:25.829 --> 01:01:25.839 align:start position:0%
what we asked for
 
01:01:27.670 --> 01:01:27.680 align:start position:0%
would come to any kind of
 
01:01:30.549 --> 01:01:30.559 align:start position:0%
reality and the reality is when you need
 
01:01:33.430 --> 01:01:33.440 align:start position:0%
the money you need the money
 
01:01:33.440 --> 01:01:35.109 align:start position:0%
the money you need the money
so

01:01:35.109 --> 01:01:35.119 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:01:37.910 --> 01:01:37.920 align:start position:0%
i know that senator daniels had asked me
 
01:01:40.309 --> 01:01:40.319 align:start position:0%
recently well why didn't you get a loan
 
01:01:42.470 --> 01:01:42.480 align:start position:0%
from the state well this was why because
 
01:01:43.910 --> 01:01:43.920 align:start position:0%
we were told
 
01:01:45.430 --> 01:01:45.440 align:start position:0%
you'd have to
 
01:01:48.069 --> 01:01:48.079 align:start position:0%
work on all this paperwork to get and
 
01:01:50.390 --> 01:01:50.400 align:start position:0%
whatever bureaucracy
 
01:01:53.030 --> 01:01:53.040 align:start position:0%
to request a loan from the state and
 
01:01:55.349 --> 01:01:55.359 align:start position:0%
there's no assurance at the end of that
 
01:01:56.870 --> 01:01:56.880 align:start position:0%
whether you would get it there's no
 
01:01:59.029 --> 01:01:59.039 align:start position:0%
assurance that we'll get anything
 
01:02:00.069 --> 01:02:00.079 align:start position:0%
from the
 
01:02:03.589 --> 01:02:03.599 align:start position:0%
projects that we've submitted to fema
 
01:02:06.470 --> 01:02:06.480 align:start position:0%
i mean we've got several projects in the
 
01:02:08.710 --> 01:02:08.720 align:start position:0%
pipeline now
 
01:02:10.549 --> 01:02:10.559 align:start position:0%
and we have no assurance that any of
 
01:02:12.710 --> 01:02:12.720 align:start position:0%
those are going to be compensated from
 
01:02:12.720 --> 01:02:14.950 align:start position:0%
those are going to be compensated from
fema

01:02:14.950 --> 01:02:14.960 align:start position:0%
fema
 
01:02:14.960 --> 01:02:17.109 align:start position:0%
fema
none

01:02:17.109 --> 01:02:17.119 align:start position:0%
none
 
01:02:18.870 --> 01:02:18.880 align:start position:0%
but the reality is you got to get the
 
01:02:20.390 --> 01:02:20.400 align:start position:0%
work done
 
01:02:22.789 --> 01:02:22.799 align:start position:0%
so we said we get the work done we
 
01:02:24.549 --> 01:02:24.559 align:start position:0%
submit it and
 
01:02:26.950 --> 01:02:26.960 align:start position:0%
cross our fingers and hope for the best
 
01:02:29.349 --> 01:02:29.359 align:start position:0%
and i gotta say too i've gotten letters
 
01:02:31.029 --> 01:02:31.039 align:start position:0%
from several other
 
01:02:31.039 --> 01:02:33.190 align:start position:0%
from several other
um

01:02:33.190 --> 01:02:33.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:02:35.510 --> 01:02:35.520 align:start position:0%
several other select board members in my
 
01:02:38.870 --> 01:02:38.880 align:start position:0%
district one from leemster
 
01:02:40.950 --> 01:02:40.960 align:start position:0%
leemster is in a precarious situation
 
01:02:43.109 --> 01:02:43.119 align:start position:0%
where we've spent one point
 
01:02:45.430 --> 01:02:45.440 align:start position:0%
uh one and a quarter million dollars of
 
01:02:49.190 --> 01:02:49.200 align:start position:0%
our own money to partially rep partially
 
01:02:51.190 --> 01:02:51.200 align:start position:0%
partially repair roads and bridges from
 
01:02:53.270 --> 01:02:53.280 align:start position:0%
the flood last summer
 
01:02:54.549 --> 01:02:54.559 align:start position:0%
we had
 
01:02:56.950 --> 01:02:56.960 align:start position:0%
have not had to borrow money nor did we
 
01:02:59.430 --> 01:02:59.440 align:start position:0%
ask for any at town meeting
 
01:03:01.430 --> 01:03:01.440 align:start position:0%
but we're certainly close to running out
 
01:03:03.829 --> 01:03:03.839 align:start position:0%
of funds because of this
 
01:03:05.670 --> 01:03:05.680 align:start position:0%
we've paid every bill that's come across
 
01:03:08.150 --> 01:03:08.160 align:start position:0%
our desk in regard to this problem and
 
01:03:10.470 --> 01:03:10.480 align:start position:0%
don't see any monies coming from fema in
 
01:03:13.750 --> 01:03:13.760 align:start position:0%
the near future in fact in acworth we're
 
01:03:16.390 --> 01:03:16.400 align:start position:0%
not expecting any kind of fema payments
 
01:03:17.750 --> 01:03:17.760 align:start position:0%
until maybe
 
01:03:22.309 --> 01:03:22.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:22.319 --> 01:03:23.330 align:start position:0%
 
currently

01:03:23.330 --> 01:03:23.340 align:start position:0%
currently
 
01:03:23.340 --> 01:03:24.549 align:start position:0%
currently
[Music]

01:03:24.549 --> 01:03:24.559 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:03:27.430 --> 01:03:27.440 align:start position:0%
these towns are waiting and waiting for
 
01:03:29.029 --> 01:03:29.039 align:start position:0%
funds to come through
 
01:03:33.029 --> 01:03:33.039 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:35.510 --> 01:03:35.520 align:start position:0%
lucian beam who is a select board member
 
01:03:37.829 --> 01:03:37.839 align:start position:0%
of langdon
 
01:03:40.470 --> 01:03:40.480 align:start position:0%
and he wrote to me to tell me that
 
01:03:43.190 --> 01:03:43.200 align:start position:0%
because of route 12 being closed down in
 
01:03:43.200 --> 01:03:44.390 align:start position:0%
because of route 12 being closed down in
charlestown

01:03:44.390 --> 01:03:44.400 align:start position:0%
charlestown
 
01:03:46.230 --> 01:03:46.240 align:start position:0%
because you know route 12 is falling
 
01:03:49.270 --> 01:03:49.280 align:start position:0%
into the connecticut river slowly
 
01:03:51.670 --> 01:03:51.680 align:start position:0%
it's having an impact on two roads in
 
01:03:51.680 --> 01:03:53.270 align:start position:0%
it's having an impact on two roads in
langdon

01:03:53.270 --> 01:03:53.280 align:start position:0%
langdon
 
01:03:56.230 --> 01:03:56.240 align:start position:0%
hemlock south hemlock road and mini road
 
01:03:58.789 --> 01:03:58.799 align:start position:0%
were subject to heavy vehicle counts
 
01:04:01.270 --> 01:04:01.280 align:start position:0%
they went from a traffic count of 50
 
01:04:04.309 --> 01:04:04.319 align:start position:0%
cars a day to well over a thousand
 
01:04:06.390 --> 01:04:06.400 align:start position:0%
and that includes trucks and that
 
01:04:10.829 --> 01:04:10.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:10.839 --> 01:04:12.390 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:04:12.390 --> 01:04:12.400 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:04:15.349 --> 01:04:15.359 align:start position:0%
clearly you know with that kind of uh
 
01:04:15.359 --> 01:04:16.150 align:start position:0%
clearly you know with that kind of uh
of

01:04:16.150 --> 01:04:16.160 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:04:16.160 --> 01:04:17.270 align:start position:0%
of
traffic

01:04:17.270 --> 01:04:17.280 align:start position:0%
traffic
 
01:04:19.670 --> 01:04:19.680 align:start position:0%
with this responsibility for langdon
 
01:04:21.910 --> 01:04:21.920 align:start position:0%
comes the cost of maintaining those two
 
01:04:25.190 --> 01:04:25.200 align:start position:0%
roads which to date has cost the town 28
 
01:04:27.829 --> 01:04:27.839 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars in the form of gravel
 
01:04:31.270 --> 01:04:31.280 align:start position:0%
stone stone sand salt and labor
 
01:04:31.280 --> 01:04:32.390 align:start position:0%
stone stone sand salt and labor
and

01:04:32.390 --> 01:04:32.400 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:04:34.069 --> 01:04:34.079 align:start position:0%
there's no guarantee fema is going to
 
01:04:35.990 --> 01:04:36.000 align:start position:0%
cover any of that
 
01:04:38.150 --> 01:04:38.160 align:start position:0%
so these towns in this area it's not
 
01:04:40.870 --> 01:04:40.880 align:start position:0%
just acworth aquathea we got we got hit
 
01:04:43.190 --> 01:04:43.200 align:start position:0%
pretty badly but the surrounding towns
 
01:04:46.069 --> 01:04:46.079 align:start position:0%
have gotten badly hurt as well
 
01:04:48.069 --> 01:04:48.079 align:start position:0%
and the fact of the matter is
 
01:04:51.910 --> 01:04:51.920 align:start position:0%
these towns are suffering financially we
 
01:04:54.549 --> 01:04:54.559 align:start position:0%
don't have the tax base to be able to
 
01:04:56.870 --> 01:04:56.880 align:start position:0%
uh you know have s have a big pot of
 
01:04:58.230 --> 01:04:58.240 align:start position:0%
money saved
 
01:05:00.390 --> 01:05:00.400 align:start position:0%
to to deal with these kinds of disasters
 
01:05:02.950 --> 01:05:02.960 align:start position:0%
and we had hoped that that the state
 
01:05:05.270 --> 01:05:05.280 align:start position:0%
would come through and you know toss us
 
01:05:07.029 --> 01:05:07.039 align:start position:0%
a bone something
 
01:05:10.150 --> 01:05:10.160 align:start position:0%
do something to help us
 
01:05:10.160 --> 01:05:11.510 align:start position:0%
do something to help us
but

01:05:11.510 --> 01:05:11.520 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:05:13.349 --> 01:05:13.359 align:start position:0%
all i can say is
 
01:05:14.870 --> 01:05:14.880 align:start position:0%
this particular
 
01:05:14.880 --> 01:05:16.150 align:start position:0%
this particular
statute

01:05:16.150 --> 01:05:16.160 align:start position:0%
statute
 
01:05:17.510 --> 01:05:17.520 align:start position:0%
and the changes
 
01:05:19.270 --> 01:05:19.280 align:start position:0%
is an improvement
 
01:05:21.910 --> 01:05:21.920 align:start position:0%
but i don't know that it goes far enough
 
01:05:24.950 --> 01:05:24.960 align:start position:0%
to really help us in the immediate
 
01:05:27.589 --> 01:05:27.599 align:start position:0%
uh time when when an event like this
 
01:05:27.599 --> 01:05:28.630 align:start position:0%
uh time when when an event like this
happens

01:05:28.630 --> 01:05:28.640 align:start position:0%
happens
 
01:05:31.910 --> 01:05:31.920 align:start position:0%
and of course as we are going forward
 
01:05:34.789 --> 01:05:34.799 align:start position:0%
we have ongoing expenses
 
01:05:36.309 --> 01:05:36.319 align:start position:0%
and we're just sitting and waiting for
 
01:05:39.510 --> 01:05:39.520 align:start position:0%
fema reimbursement if that ever comes so
 
01:05:42.069 --> 01:05:42.079 align:start position:0%
that's kind of all i wanted to report to
 
01:05:43.270 --> 01:05:43.280 align:start position:0%
you and
 
01:05:45.270 --> 01:05:45.280 align:start position:0%
i hope that as a committee you can do
 
01:05:45.280 --> 01:05:47.670 align:start position:0%
i hope that as a committee you can do
something

01:05:47.670 --> 01:05:47.680 align:start position:0%
something
 
01:05:47.680 --> 01:05:48.870 align:start position:0%
something
to

01:05:48.870 --> 01:05:48.880 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:05:52.150 --> 01:05:52.160 align:start position:0%
maybe improve this to to be able to give
 
01:05:54.470 --> 01:05:54.480 align:start position:0%
more immediate funding to these towns
 
01:05:54.480 --> 01:05:55.750 align:start position:0%
more immediate funding to these towns
either

01:05:55.750 --> 01:05:55.760 align:start position:0%
either
 
01:05:58.789 --> 01:05:58.799 align:start position:0%
right after the event happens or as they
 
01:06:01.510 --> 01:06:01.520 align:start position:0%
are sitting and waiting and waiting for
 
01:06:02.950 --> 01:06:02.960 align:start position:0%
any kind of reimbursement from the
 
01:06:04.950 --> 01:06:04.960 align:start position:0%
federal government it would be nice if
 
01:06:07.190 --> 01:06:07.200 align:start position:0%
the state could just grant some money
 
01:06:09.349 --> 01:06:09.359 align:start position:0%
and yes i know you know to
 
01:06:12.069 --> 01:06:12.079 align:start position:0%
representative leishman's question
 
01:06:13.510 --> 01:06:13.520 align:start position:0%
i know that
 
01:06:15.029 --> 01:06:15.039 align:start position:0%
there's an expectation well you're going
 
01:06:16.390 --> 01:06:16.400 align:start position:0%
to be getting money from the federal
 
01:06:17.990 --> 01:06:18.000 align:start position:0%
government well you know it would be
 
01:06:19.750 --> 01:06:19.760 align:start position:0%
nice not to have to
 
01:06:22.230 --> 01:06:22.240 align:start position:0%
rely on them to begin with
 
01:06:22.240 --> 01:06:23.750 align:start position:0%
rely on them to begin with
and

01:06:23.750 --> 01:06:23.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:06:25.510 --> 01:06:25.520 align:start position:0%
that's all i have to say i'd be happy to
 
01:06:27.270 --> 01:06:27.280 align:start position:0%
answer any questions
 
01:06:29.109 --> 01:06:29.119 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
01:06:33.349 --> 01:06:33.359 align:start position:0%
representative aaron uh president weiler
 
01:06:34.870 --> 01:06:34.880 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you
 
01:06:36.710 --> 01:06:36.720 align:start position:0%
representative aaron
 
01:06:38.950 --> 01:06:38.960 align:start position:0%
keep careful track of all the money the
 
01:06:40.470 --> 01:06:40.480 align:start position:0%
town spends
 
01:06:42.789 --> 01:06:42.799 align:start position:0%
that will be like a soft match if they
 
01:06:45.109 --> 01:06:45.119 align:start position:0%
ever demand any kind of match all that
 
01:06:47.589 --> 01:06:47.599 align:start position:0%
can be considered so
 
01:06:49.190 --> 01:06:49.200 align:start position:0%
if as long as somebody's keeping track
 
01:06:51.029 --> 01:06:51.039 align:start position:0%
of all that extra work
 
01:06:52.630 --> 01:06:52.640 align:start position:0%
it's going to be credited you may not be
 
01:06:54.630 --> 01:06:54.640 align:start position:0%
repaid for it in full
 
01:06:55.990 --> 01:06:56.000 align:start position:0%
but at least
 
01:06:58.950 --> 01:06:58.960 align:start position:0%
that's a beginning thank you
 
01:07:00.710 --> 01:07:00.720 align:start position:0%
are there any further
 
01:07:03.190 --> 01:07:03.200 align:start position:0%
questions represent leishman
 
01:07:04.950 --> 01:07:04.960 align:start position:0%
thanks man of chair thanks for your
 
01:07:07.510 --> 01:07:07.520 align:start position:0%
testimony and appearing so i do have a
 
01:07:09.910 --> 01:07:09.920 align:start position:0%
concern as you indicated and picked up
 
01:07:11.910 --> 01:07:11.920 align:start position:0%
on as far as these small towns coming up
 
01:07:13.910 --> 01:07:13.920 align:start position:0%
with any sort of repayment because you
 
01:07:16.150 --> 01:07:16.160 align:start position:0%
have such a limited tax base but i'm
 
01:07:19.270 --> 01:07:19.280 align:start position:0%
curious the 2.1 million dollar loan what
 
01:07:21.109 --> 01:07:21.119 align:start position:0%
were the terms for repayment do you
 
01:07:21.119 --> 01:07:22.470 align:start position:0%
were the terms for repayment do you
recall

01:07:22.470 --> 01:07:22.480 align:start position:0%
recall
 
01:07:25.430 --> 01:07:25.440 align:start position:0%
the bank mascoma bank bless their hearts
 
01:07:25.440 --> 01:07:26.470 align:start position:0%
the bank mascoma bank bless their hearts
are

01:07:26.470 --> 01:07:26.480 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:07:29.430 --> 01:07:29.440 align:start position:0%
are working with us
 
01:07:32.309 --> 01:07:32.319 align:start position:0%
they have been very very generous in
 
01:07:33.829 --> 01:07:33.839 align:start position:0%
their terms
 
01:07:35.910 --> 01:07:35.920 align:start position:0%
they are willing to work with us they
 
01:07:37.829 --> 01:07:37.839 align:start position:0%
realize the
 
01:07:40.950 --> 01:07:40.960 align:start position:0%
enormous impact this has had on a town
 
01:07:44.630 --> 01:07:44.640 align:start position:0%
our size were 850 people
 
01:07:47.829 --> 01:07:47.839 align:start position:0%
we have an annual operating budget of
 
01:07:50.630 --> 01:07:50.640 align:start position:0%
1.3 million dollars
 
01:07:53.430 --> 01:07:53.440 align:start position:0%
the damage that was done in our town
 
01:07:57.109 --> 01:07:57.119 align:start position:0%
has been estimated upwards of 26 million
 
01:07:59.990 --> 01:08:00.000 align:start position:0%
and 26 million uh you know certainly
 
01:08:01.990 --> 01:08:02.000 align:start position:0%
that would be if every road was put back
 
01:08:03.670 --> 01:08:03.680 align:start position:0%
perfectly the way it's supposed to with
 
01:08:05.829 --> 01:08:05.839 align:start position:0%
the right size culverts with the right
 
01:08:07.589 --> 01:08:07.599 align:start position:0%
size everything it's you know the
 
01:08:10.309 --> 01:08:10.319 align:start position:0%
perfect the way it should be we're
 
01:08:13.750 --> 01:08:13.760 align:start position:0%
probably not going to get to that
 
01:08:15.829 --> 01:08:15.839 align:start position:0%
because as whatever we can budget is
 
01:08:15.839 --> 01:08:16.630 align:start position:0%
because as whatever we can budget is
what

01:08:16.630 --> 01:08:16.640 align:start position:0%
what
 
01:08:18.470 --> 01:08:18.480 align:start position:0%
whatever we can pay is what we're going
 
01:08:20.950 --> 01:08:20.960 align:start position:0%
to be able to pay and
 
01:08:24.149 --> 01:08:24.159 align:start position:0%
so we may not be able to use the biggest
 
01:08:26.709 --> 01:08:26.719 align:start position:0%
rightist kind of culvert for any
 
01:08:29.990 --> 01:08:30.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:31.910 --> 01:08:31.920 align:start position:0%
but we'll do what we can do within our
 
01:08:33.990 --> 01:08:34.000 align:start position:0%
financial means
 
01:08:36.070 --> 01:08:36.080 align:start position:0%
and right now we're sitting here
 
01:08:39.189 --> 01:08:39.199 align:start position:0%
thinking okay well we're sort of with
 
01:08:41.269 --> 01:08:41.279 align:start position:0%
this 2.1 million dollar loan we've
 
01:08:43.749 --> 01:08:43.759 align:start position:0%
structured it to be sort of like a home
 
01:08:46.070 --> 01:08:46.080 align:start position:0%
equity loan that you can tap into
 
01:08:48.309 --> 01:08:48.319 align:start position:0%
grab some money to do a project
 
01:08:50.149 --> 01:08:50.159 align:start position:0%
when you get reimbursed from the project
 
01:08:52.070 --> 01:08:52.080 align:start position:0%
you take some of that funding and you
 
01:08:54.390 --> 01:08:54.400 align:start position:0%
put it back pay back that
 
01:08:57.189 --> 01:08:57.199 align:start position:0%
part of the loan so we're only being
 
01:08:59.189 --> 01:08:59.199 align:start position:0%
we're only having to pay interest on the
 
01:09:01.510 --> 01:09:01.520 align:start position:0%
amount of that money that we've been
 
01:09:05.349 --> 01:09:05.359 align:start position:0%
pulling out not the whole 2.1 million
 
01:09:05.359 --> 01:09:06.470 align:start position:0%
pulling out not the whole 2.1 million
so

01:09:06.470 --> 01:09:06.480 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:09:09.430 --> 01:09:09.440 align:start position:0%
the bank has been very generous in their
 
01:09:12.870 --> 01:09:12.880 align:start position:0%
terms in working with us to do that
 
01:09:14.870 --> 01:09:14.880 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:09:16.070 --> 01:09:16.080 align:start position:0%
so we're
 
01:09:17.269 --> 01:09:17.279 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:09:19.189 --> 01:09:19.199 align:start position:0%
we spent i think
 
01:09:21.349 --> 01:09:21.359 align:start position:0%
last year
 
01:09:24.390 --> 01:09:24.400 align:start position:0%
i think we spent about 1.3 million on
 
01:09:27.030 --> 01:09:27.040 align:start position:0%
road repair and we are estimating for
 
01:09:29.510 --> 01:09:29.520 align:start position:0%
this year 1.6 million
 
01:09:29.520 --> 01:09:30.390 align:start position:0%
this year 1.6 million
and

01:09:30.390 --> 01:09:30.400 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:09:32.470 --> 01:09:32.480 align:start position:0%
some of that is going to be loan money
 
01:09:35.030 --> 01:09:35.040 align:start position:0%
some of that is tax money and
 
01:09:36.870 --> 01:09:36.880 align:start position:0%
you know we'd be
 
01:09:39.110 --> 01:09:39.120 align:start position:0%
we'd be blessed if the state threw us
 
01:09:41.430 --> 01:09:41.440 align:start position:0%
some extra money to help us in the form
 
01:09:43.590 --> 01:09:43.600 align:start position:0%
of a grant but i don't see that that's
 
01:09:44.789 --> 01:09:44.799 align:start position:0%
gonna happen
 
01:09:48.309 --> 01:09:48.319 align:start position:0%
unfortunately you never know i please i
 
01:09:50.950 --> 01:09:50.960 align:start position:0%
would love it if you can do that
 
01:09:53.269 --> 01:09:53.279 align:start position:0%
are there any further questions uh
 
01:09:53.279 --> 01:09:54.870 align:start position:0%
are there any further questions uh
representative

01:09:54.870 --> 01:09:54.880 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:09:57.110 --> 01:09:57.120 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair uh thank you for
 
01:09:59.030 --> 01:09:59.040 align:start position:0%
your testimony it certainly underscores
 
01:10:00.830 --> 01:10:00.840 align:start position:0%
the need for this
 
01:10:04.149 --> 01:10:04.159 align:start position:0%
legislation uh my question is i had one
 
01:10:05.910 --> 01:10:05.920 align:start position:0%
that representative leishman had asked
 
01:10:07.189 --> 01:10:07.199 align:start position:0%
but the second one that i was thinking
 
01:10:09.110 --> 01:10:09.120 align:start position:0%
about was have you reached out to our
 
01:10:09.120 --> 01:10:10.390 align:start position:0%
about was have you reached out to our
congressional

01:10:10.390 --> 01:10:10.400 align:start position:0%
congressional
 
01:10:10.400 --> 01:10:11.910 align:start position:0%
congressional
delegation

01:10:11.910 --> 01:10:11.920 align:start position:0%
delegation
 
01:10:14.310 --> 01:10:14.320 align:start position:0%
and were they able to apparently not
 
01:10:16.950 --> 01:10:16.960 align:start position:0%
able to help pressure fema no we
 
01:10:19.030 --> 01:10:19.040 align:start position:0%
contacted just about everybody that we
 
01:10:21.910 --> 01:10:21.920 align:start position:0%
could and uh there was nothing that they
 
01:10:27.030 --> 01:10:27.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:30.070 --> 01:10:30.080 align:start position:0%
are there further questions
 
01:10:32.550 --> 01:10:32.560 align:start position:0%
thank you very much representative aaron
 
01:10:35.669 --> 01:10:35.679 align:start position:0%
and appreciate it
 
01:10:38.470 --> 01:10:38.480 align:start position:0%
i will now call on um
 
01:10:48.630 --> 01:10:48.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:50.470 --> 01:10:50.480 align:start position:0%
good morning representative umberger and
 
01:10:51.990 --> 01:10:52.000 align:start position:0%
members of the committee
 
01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:53.270 align:start position:0%
members of the committee
morning

01:10:53.270 --> 01:10:53.280 align:start position:0%
morning
 
01:10:54.630 --> 01:10:54.640 align:start position:0%
my name is catherine heck and i
 
01:10:56.229 --> 01:10:56.239 align:start position:0%
represent the new hampshire municipal
 
01:10:58.630 --> 01:10:58.640 align:start position:0%
association and we are here to support
 
01:11:02.070 --> 01:11:02.080 align:start position:0%
senate bill 409 and i won't reiterate
 
01:11:04.229 --> 01:11:04.239 align:start position:0%
all the reasons what were stated in
 
01:11:07.590 --> 01:11:07.600 align:start position:0%
previous testimony except to say that
 
01:11:09.669 --> 01:11:09.679 align:start position:0%
always additional financial tools in the
 
01:11:12.229 --> 01:11:12.239 align:start position:0%
event of an emergency or disaster can be
 
01:11:15.189 --> 01:11:15.199 align:start position:0%
beneficial to our communities
 
01:11:17.350 --> 01:11:17.360 align:start position:0%
to representative mooney's point we have
 
01:11:19.910 --> 01:11:19.920 align:start position:0%
senate bill 402 that's
 
01:11:21.669 --> 01:11:21.679 align:start position:0%
going to be coming over to the house
 
01:11:23.430 --> 01:11:23.440 align:start position:0%
that creates an avenue for the governor
 
01:11:24.790 --> 01:11:24.800 align:start position:0%
to approve
 
01:11:27.030 --> 01:11:27.040 align:start position:0%
with the executive council
 
01:11:28.790 --> 01:11:28.800 align:start position:0%
and disburse financial assistance to
 
01:11:31.510 --> 01:11:31.520 align:start position:0%
municipalities as well as
 
01:11:35.990 --> 01:11:36.000 align:start position:0%
rsa 13 colon 4 already allows the
 
01:11:37.669 --> 01:11:37.679 align:start position:0%
governor to
 
01:11:40.470 --> 01:11:40.480 align:start position:0%
grant such emergency grants in the event
 
01:11:41.910 --> 01:11:41.920 align:start position:0%
of an emergency through specific
 
01:11:45.270 --> 01:11:45.280 align:start position:0%
channels so that combined with fema and
 
01:11:47.350 --> 01:11:47.360 align:start position:0%
legislation like this that could
 
01:11:49.669 --> 01:11:49.679 align:start position:0%
hopefully fill some of the gaps that
 
01:11:52.229 --> 01:11:52.239 align:start position:0%
exist in the event of a catastrophic
 
01:11:54.790 --> 01:11:54.800 align:start position:0%
municipal emergency so i will keep my
 
01:11:56.630 --> 01:11:56.640 align:start position:0%
testimony short and answer any questions
 
01:11:58.390 --> 01:11:58.400 align:start position:0%
you might have
 
01:12:00.070 --> 01:12:00.080 align:start position:0%

seeing none
 
01:12:05.990 --> 01:12:06.000 align:start position:0%

loan rule
 
01:13:03.030 --> 01:13:03.040 align:start position:0%
um that will be amended
 
01:13:05.669 --> 01:13:05.679 align:start position:0%
based on the outcome of what happens
 
01:13:07.189 --> 01:13:07.199 align:start position:0%
with this bill
 
01:13:09.110 --> 01:13:09.120 align:start position:0%
but i just want fallon to go through a
 
01:13:11.110 --> 01:13:11.120 align:start position:0%
couple of the points that may answer
 
01:13:13.590 --> 01:13:13.600 align:start position:0%
some questions that have come up in this
 
01:13:15.830 --> 01:13:15.840 align:start position:0%
sure excuse me just a minute
 
01:13:15.840 --> 01:13:16.790 align:start position:0%
sure excuse me just a minute
um

01:13:16.790 --> 01:13:16.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:13:19.510 --> 01:13:19.520 align:start position:0%
you said there's another bill out there
 
01:13:23.430 --> 01:13:23.440 align:start position:0%
this bill came from the current 21p 37
 
01:13:24.550 --> 01:13:24.560 align:start position:0%
see so
 
01:13:25.830 --> 01:13:25.840 align:start position:0%
there's the we already have
 
01:13:27.750 --> 01:13:27.760 align:start position:0%
administrative rules to reflect the
 
01:13:27.760 --> 01:13:28.790 align:start position:0%
administrative rules to reflect the
current

01:13:28.790 --> 01:13:28.800 align:start position:0%
current
 
01:13:28.800 --> 01:13:29.669 align:start position:0%
current
um

01:13:29.669 --> 01:13:29.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:13:32.630 --> 01:13:32.640 align:start position:0%
bill that senator guida put through in
 
01:13:32.640 --> 01:13:34.229 align:start position:0%
bill that senator guida put through in
2018

01:13:34.229 --> 01:13:34.239 align:start position:0%
2018
 
01:13:35.750 --> 01:13:35.760 align:start position:0%
so there's
 
01:13:37.430 --> 01:13:37.440 align:start position:0%
rules that will answer some of the
 
01:13:39.590 --> 01:13:39.600 align:start position:0%
questions you all brought up
 
01:13:41.189 --> 01:13:41.199 align:start position:0%
that would just be amended based on the
 
01:13:46.390 --> 01:13:46.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:46.400 --> 01:13:47.270 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:13:47.270 --> 01:13:47.280 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:13:49.590 --> 01:13:49.600 align:start position:0%
and and we do need a card from you as
 
01:13:52.709 --> 01:13:52.719 align:start position:0%
well sure okay so sword interrupt please
 
01:13:55.669 --> 01:13:55.679 align:start position:0%
go ahead no that's okay um so a couple
 
01:13:57.669 --> 01:13:57.679 align:start position:0%
notes i just based on previous questions
 
01:13:59.510 --> 01:13:59.520 align:start position:0%
that um you had asked
 
01:14:02.229 --> 01:14:02.239 align:start position:0%
so in regards to um
 
01:14:04.950 --> 01:14:04.960 align:start position:0%
the house bill 1665 the one that
 
01:14:07.669 --> 01:14:07.679 align:start position:0%
representative aaron sponsored for the
 
01:14:09.510 --> 01:14:09.520 align:start position:0%
roads and bridges so one thing that had
 
01:14:10.790 --> 01:14:10.800 align:start position:0%
come up with that
 
01:14:13.270 --> 01:14:13.280 align:start position:0%
and goes to
 
01:14:14.870 --> 01:14:14.880 align:start position:0%
the conversation between a loan and a
 
01:14:14.880 --> 01:14:15.830 align:start position:0%
the conversation between a loan and a
grant

01:14:15.830 --> 01:14:15.840 align:start position:0%
grant
 
01:14:17.830 --> 01:14:17.840 align:start position:0%
is if the state were to grant a
 
01:14:20.550 --> 01:14:20.560 align:start position:0%
community money for these repairs it
 
01:14:22.870 --> 01:14:22.880 align:start position:0%
would conflict with fema eligibility and
 
01:14:25.030 --> 01:14:25.040 align:start position:0%
so fema would not be able to reimburse
 
01:14:26.149 --> 01:14:26.159 align:start position:0%
the communities because they would
 
01:14:28.229 --> 01:14:28.239 align:start position:0%
consider it
 
01:14:30.950 --> 01:14:30.960 align:start position:0%
duplication of benefits so
 
01:14:30.960 --> 01:14:32.750 align:start position:0%
duplication of benefits so
through

01:14:32.750 --> 01:14:32.760 align:start position:0%
through
 
01:14:35.510 --> 01:14:35.520 align:start position:0%
21p37 and other things the state has
 
01:14:37.510 --> 01:14:37.520 align:start position:0%
loaned has come up with this loan which
 
01:14:39.669 --> 01:14:39.679 align:start position:0%
is just a temporary to get them through
 
01:14:42.550 --> 01:14:42.560 align:start position:0%
which fema does not see as a duplication
 
01:14:44.870 --> 01:14:44.880 align:start position:0%
of benefits it's just a temporary loan
 
01:14:46.550 --> 01:14:46.560 align:start position:0%
of money so that's kind of the
 
01:14:47.990 --> 01:14:48.000 align:start position:0%
difference between
 
01:14:49.910 --> 01:14:49.920 align:start position:0%
some of those things
 
01:14:52.229 --> 01:14:52.239 align:start position:0%
as i mentioned we do have rules already
 
01:14:53.750 --> 01:14:53.760 align:start position:0%
so there is a
 
01:14:55.350 --> 01:14:55.360 align:start position:0%
piece in the rule
 
01:14:58.790 --> 01:14:58.800 align:start position:0%
about the loan repo repayment
 
01:15:00.390 --> 01:15:00.400 align:start position:0%
that if the amount that the fema
 
01:15:02.070 --> 01:15:02.080 align:start position:0%
assistance is
 
01:15:03.750 --> 01:15:03.760 align:start position:0%
the state treasurer
 
01:15:05.270 --> 01:15:05.280 align:start position:0%
with the advice and consent of governor
 
01:15:07.270 --> 01:15:07.280 align:start position:0%
and council shall negotiate the terms of
 
01:15:07.280 --> 01:15:08.390 align:start position:0%
and council shall negotiate the terms of
repayment

01:15:08.390 --> 01:15:08.400 align:start position:0%
repayment
 
01:15:10.229 --> 01:15:10.239 align:start position:0%
if the local and state treasurer are
 
01:15:12.070 --> 01:15:12.080 align:start position:0%
unable to reach an agreement the
 
01:15:13.590 --> 01:15:13.600 align:start position:0%
department of revenue administration
 
01:15:15.669 --> 01:15:15.679 align:start position:0%
shall include the amount in the amount a
 
01:15:17.910 --> 01:15:17.920 align:start position:0%
portion of setting property tax rates so
 
01:15:19.590 --> 01:15:19.600 align:start position:0%
i'm hoping that answers your question
 
01:15:19.600 --> 01:15:20.709 align:start position:0%
i'm hoping that answers your question
representative

01:15:20.709 --> 01:15:20.719 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:15:23.350 --> 01:15:23.360 align:start position:0%
lynn about um what to do if we can't
 
01:15:26.550 --> 01:15:26.560 align:start position:0%
come to an agreement
 
01:15:26.560 --> 01:15:28.390 align:start position:0%
come to an agreement
um

01:15:28.390 --> 01:15:28.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:15:31.189 --> 01:15:31.199 align:start position:0%
as far as how the anticipated assistance
 
01:15:33.270 --> 01:15:33.280 align:start position:0%
is determined there's a couple steps in
 
01:15:35.510 --> 01:15:35.520 align:start position:0%
that so when we have a disaster that
 
01:15:37.110 --> 01:15:37.120 align:start position:0%
occurs in the state
 
01:15:39.830 --> 01:15:39.840 align:start position:0%
and our office the division of homeland
 
01:15:41.510 --> 01:15:41.520 align:start position:0%
security and emergency management which
 
01:15:44.070 --> 01:15:44.080 align:start position:0%
is a division within safety will reach
 
01:15:45.990 --> 01:15:46.000 align:start position:0%
out to our local and state partners to
 
01:15:47.430 --> 01:15:47.440 align:start position:0%
assess what their initial damage
 
01:15:49.510 --> 01:15:49.520 align:start position:0%
assessments are and if we think we're
 
01:15:51.030 --> 01:15:51.040 align:start position:0%
going to meet the threshold which is
 
01:15:53.510 --> 01:15:53.520 align:start position:0%
just over two million dollars then we'll
 
01:15:55.669 --> 01:15:55.679 align:start position:0%
have fema come in and validate those
 
01:15:58.310 --> 01:15:58.320 align:start position:0%
costs with us to do a preliminary damage
 
01:16:01.110 --> 01:16:01.120 align:start position:0%
assessment which is what we did um after
 
01:16:02.709 --> 01:16:02.719 align:start position:0%
the storms this
 
01:16:06.229 --> 01:16:06.239 align:start position:0%
summer and so the damage assessments for
 
01:16:07.910 --> 01:16:07.920 align:start position:0%
both those storms
 
01:16:09.510 --> 01:16:09.520 align:start position:0%
together was just about six million
 
01:16:12.149 --> 01:16:12.159 align:start position:0%
dollars but that's not all-inclusive
 
01:16:13.910 --> 01:16:13.920 align:start position:0%
they get to a point where they're
 
01:16:15.750 --> 01:16:15.760 align:start position:0%
comfortable saying yes you have exceeded
 
01:16:18.149 --> 01:16:18.159 align:start position:0%
it and then that triggers the request
 
01:16:19.990 --> 01:16:20.000 align:start position:0%
from us to
 
01:16:21.590 --> 01:16:21.600 align:start position:0%
the president for the disaster
 
01:16:24.390 --> 01:16:24.400 align:start position:0%
declaration and what's been going on now
 
01:16:26.310 --> 01:16:26.320 align:start position:0%
and since october when we received the
 
01:16:28.310 --> 01:16:28.320 align:start position:0%
disaster declaration
 
01:16:30.709 --> 01:16:30.719 align:start position:0%
is the more detailed
 
01:16:33.669 --> 01:16:33.679 align:start position:0%
line item assessment of the actual cost
 
01:16:36.229 --> 01:16:36.239 align:start position:0%
which as of last week um
 
01:16:39.030 --> 01:16:39.040 align:start position:0%
is not completely validated but between
 
01:16:40.790 --> 01:16:40.800 align:start position:0%
the two disasters were right around the
 
01:16:43.990 --> 01:16:44.000 align:start position:0%
18 million mark so you can see where we
 
01:16:46.070 --> 01:16:46.080 align:start position:0%
started at you know the 6 million with
 
01:16:47.750 --> 01:16:47.760 align:start position:0%
what fema initially said and we're up to
 
01:16:49.830 --> 01:16:49.840 align:start position:0%
18 and we're working on validating all
 
01:16:53.750 --> 01:16:53.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:56.390 --> 01:16:56.400 align:start position:0%
as far as the current loan goes
 
01:16:58.390 --> 01:16:58.400 align:start position:0%
for exceptional disaster relief it's a
 
01:17:00.630 --> 01:17:00.640 align:start position:0%
one-page loan application
 
01:17:03.189 --> 01:17:03.199 align:start position:0%
and just a few pieces of information
 
01:17:05.270 --> 01:17:05.280 align:start position:0%
that are needed from the community
 
01:17:07.590 --> 01:17:07.600 align:start position:0%
we work off of the damage assessment
 
01:17:10.149 --> 01:17:10.159 align:start position:0%
numbers um to do the loan we have yet to
 
01:17:12.709 --> 01:17:12.719 align:start position:0%
issue a loan under this program yet um
 
01:17:14.790 --> 01:17:14.800 align:start position:0%
we haven't had a request for that
 
01:17:17.350 --> 01:17:17.360 align:start position:0%
but it is a we would fast track that as
 
01:17:19.350 --> 01:17:19.360 align:start position:0%
it's needed that the information or the
 
01:17:20.950 --> 01:17:20.960 align:start position:0%
money is needed
 
01:17:23.189 --> 01:17:23.199 align:start position:0%
um it's currently at
 
01:17:24.709 --> 01:17:24.719 align:start position:0%
with the interest rate that's listed in
 
01:17:27.110 --> 01:17:27.120 align:start position:0%
the current rules says no greater than
 
01:17:28.630 --> 01:17:28.640 align:start position:0%
the prevailing rate
 
01:17:30.790 --> 01:17:30.800 align:start position:0%
and then with this modification to zero
 
01:17:31.910 --> 01:17:31.920 align:start position:0%
interest we think that would be
 
01:17:33.990 --> 01:17:34.000 align:start position:0%
beneficial to everyone
 
01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:35.030 align:start position:0%
beneficial to everyone
um

01:17:35.030 --> 01:17:35.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:17:36.630 --> 01:17:36.640 align:start position:0%
one other piece that i did want to
 
01:17:38.870 --> 01:17:38.880 align:start position:0%
mention represent wyler with the public
 
01:17:40.470 --> 01:17:40.480 align:start position:0%
assistance program there is no soft
 
01:17:42.310 --> 01:17:42.320 align:start position:0%
match so
 
01:17:44.470 --> 01:17:44.480 align:start position:0%
it's for our non-disaster grants that
 
01:17:47.350 --> 01:17:47.360 align:start position:0%
have a soft match the disaster grants on
 
01:17:49.270 --> 01:17:49.280 align:start position:0%
the community or the applicant is
 
01:17:51.430 --> 01:17:51.440 align:start position:0%
responsible for the 25
 
01:17:53.430 --> 01:17:53.440 align:start position:0%
unless we come up with something else
 
01:17:55.350 --> 01:17:55.360 align:start position:0%
currently for these two disasters based
 
01:17:55.360 --> 01:17:56.149 align:start position:0%
currently for these two disasters based
on

01:17:56.149 --> 01:17:56.159 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:17:59.510 --> 01:17:59.520 align:start position:0%
some um items that the president has
 
01:18:02.149 --> 01:18:02.159 align:start position:0%
passed it's a 9010 split right now so
 
01:18:04.310 --> 01:18:04.320 align:start position:0%
the applicant's only responsible for 10
 
01:18:06.229 --> 01:18:06.239 align:start position:0%
for these two disasters
 
01:18:06.239 --> 01:18:07.350 align:start position:0%
for these two disasters
um

01:18:07.350 --> 01:18:07.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:18:09.669 --> 01:18:09.679 align:start position:0%
and that's kind of i'm hoping i answered
 
01:18:11.189 --> 01:18:11.199 align:start position:0%
all the questions you had previously and
 
01:18:12.390 --> 01:18:12.400 align:start position:0%
we're certainly willing to answer
 
01:18:16.870 --> 01:18:16.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:18.870 --> 01:18:18.880 align:start position:0%
representative weiler
 
01:18:21.189 --> 01:18:21.199 align:start position:0%
no by soft match you say the community
 
01:18:23.350 --> 01:18:23.360 align:start position:0%
might be responsible for 10 percent
 
01:18:24.790 --> 01:18:24.800 align:start position:0%
wouldn't that include all the work
 
01:18:28.870 --> 01:18:28.880 align:start position:0%
they've done so the um
 
01:18:31.189 --> 01:18:31.199 align:start position:0%
the work that they have done
 
01:18:34.709 --> 01:18:34.719 align:start position:0%
is what is reimbursed at you know 75 or
 
01:18:36.790 --> 01:18:36.800 align:start position:0%
90 in this case
 
01:18:39.270 --> 01:18:39.280 align:start position:0%
they are not responsible to
 
01:18:41.669 --> 01:18:41.679 align:start position:0%
pay us the 10 or anything like that they
 
01:18:42.630 --> 01:18:42.640 align:start position:0%
would just
 
01:18:44.550 --> 01:18:44.560 align:start position:0%
um either absorb that or if the state
 
01:18:46.709 --> 01:18:46.719 align:start position:0%
were to make a modification which is
 
01:18:49.669 --> 01:18:49.679 align:start position:0%
what the senate bill 402 is looking to
 
01:18:52.229 --> 01:18:52.239 align:start position:0%
do is have that opportunity based on the
 
01:18:53.510 --> 01:18:53.520 align:start position:0%
amendment that
 
01:18:55.669 --> 01:18:55.679 align:start position:0%
was passed through last week for the
 
01:18:56.950 --> 01:18:56.960 align:start position:0%
governor to
 
01:18:58.950 --> 01:18:58.960 align:start position:0%
be able to say you know we'd like to
 
01:19:00.790 --> 01:19:00.800 align:start position:0%
help the community and it's kind of
 
01:19:02.709 --> 01:19:02.719 align:start position:0%
open-ended so that it's not a
 
01:19:04.709 --> 01:19:04.719 align:start position:0%
we the bill had originally started with
 
01:19:07.750 --> 01:19:07.760 align:start position:0%
um 12 and a half 12 and a half
 
01:19:09.830 --> 01:19:09.840 align:start position:0%
but basically it was amended so that a
 
01:19:11.669 --> 01:19:11.679 align:start position:0%
community could ask the governor to go
 
01:19:11.679 --> 01:19:12.390 align:start position:0%
community could ask the governor to go
to

01:19:12.390 --> 01:19:12.400 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:19:14.630 --> 01:19:14.640 align:start position:0%
the legislature and say we'd like to
 
01:19:16.070 --> 01:19:16.080 align:start position:0%
help them
 
01:19:18.310 --> 01:19:18.320 align:start position:0%
for whatever amount is deemed but so
 
01:19:19.830 --> 01:19:19.840 align:start position:0%
soft match generally when it comes to
 
01:19:21.430 --> 01:19:21.440 align:start position:0%
the grants is
 
01:19:23.669 --> 01:19:23.679 align:start position:0%
we look at volunteer time or staff time
 
01:19:25.830 --> 01:19:25.840 align:start position:0%
and offset that it doesn't apply for
 
01:19:27.669 --> 01:19:27.679 align:start position:0%
disaster grants because you're looking
 
01:19:30.149 --> 01:19:30.159 align:start position:0%
more at the labor materials all that
 
01:19:33.030 --> 01:19:33.040 align:start position:0%
kind of stuff so it's a it's a cash kind
 
01:19:36.149 --> 01:19:36.159 align:start position:0%
of responsibility so fema will cover 75
 
01:19:37.270 --> 01:19:37.280 align:start position:0%
or 90
 
01:19:38.470 --> 01:19:38.480 align:start position:0%
and then it's on the individual
 
01:19:40.470 --> 01:19:40.480 align:start position:0%
applicant to make sure that they cover
 
01:19:42.870 --> 01:19:42.880 align:start position:0%
the 10 or whatever percent it happens to
 
01:19:45.590 --> 01:19:45.600 align:start position:0%
be for that disaster thank you
 
01:19:47.430 --> 01:19:47.440 align:start position:0%
representative lynn
 
01:19:49.110 --> 01:19:49.120 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair so
 
01:19:50.149 --> 01:19:50.159 align:start position:0%
i just want to make sure that i'm going
 
01:19:51.590 --> 01:19:51.600 align:start position:0%
to if i'm understanding what you said
 
01:19:53.350 --> 01:19:53.360 align:start position:0%
that there's a rule that has been
 
01:19:56.709 --> 01:19:56.719 align:start position:0%
adopted by dra is it that so it's a dos
 
01:19:58.709 --> 01:19:58.719 align:start position:0%
the department of safety rule okay and
 
01:19:58.719 --> 01:19:59.430 align:start position:0%
the department of safety rule okay and
the

01:19:59.430 --> 01:19:59.440 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:20:01.270 --> 01:20:01.280 align:start position:0%
language in the rule
 
01:20:01.280 --> 01:20:02.830 align:start position:0%
language in the rule
um

01:20:02.830 --> 01:20:02.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:20:06.149 --> 01:20:06.159 align:start position:0%
it's under the section for loan terms
 
01:20:08.390 --> 01:20:08.400 align:start position:0%
paragraph b as in baker
 
01:20:10.229 --> 01:20:10.239 align:start position:0%
and it says if the local government and
 
01:20:11.990 --> 01:20:12.000 align:start position:0%
the state treasurer are unable to reach
 
01:20:14.310 --> 01:20:14.320 align:start position:0%
an agreement on the repayment then dra
 
01:20:16.070 --> 01:20:16.080 align:start position:0%
will include the amount
 
01:20:18.550 --> 01:20:18.560 align:start position:0%
um in the amount of portions in setting
 
01:20:21.110 --> 01:20:21.120 align:start position:0%
the property tax rate so so if if i'm
 
01:20:22.950 --> 01:20:22.960 align:start position:0%
understanding the the bottom line of
 
01:20:25.270 --> 01:20:25.280 align:start position:0%
that rule so to speak is if the if the
 
01:20:27.110 --> 01:20:27.120 align:start position:0%
town and the state are not able to to
 
01:20:29.830 --> 01:20:29.840 align:start position:0%
reach an agreement dra will say the town
 
01:20:29.840 --> 01:20:31.030 align:start position:0%
reach an agreement dra will say the town
loses

01:20:31.030 --> 01:20:31.040 align:start position:0%
loses
 
01:20:33.270 --> 01:20:33.280 align:start position:0%
yes based on the way this paragraph is
 
01:20:35.590 --> 01:20:35.600 align:start position:0%
okay and then and and may i just ask one
 
01:20:35.600 --> 01:20:36.550 align:start position:0%
okay and then and and may i just ask one
follow-up

01:20:36.550 --> 01:20:36.560 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
01:20:39.430 --> 01:20:39.440 align:start position:0%
you may and so then so now it's gonna
 
01:20:41.350 --> 01:20:41.360 align:start position:0%
that money that has to be repaid is
 
01:20:43.430 --> 01:20:43.440 align:start position:0%
gonna be included in the towns what the
 
01:20:45.189 --> 01:20:45.199 align:start position:0%
town has to collect in taxes and then
 
01:20:47.350 --> 01:20:47.360 align:start position:0%
will then be repaid to the state okay
 
01:20:49.669 --> 01:20:49.679 align:start position:0%
thank you sure
 
01:20:52.709 --> 01:20:52.719 align:start position:0%
are there any further questions
 
01:20:54.550 --> 01:20:54.560 align:start position:0%
representative turcotte thank you madam
 
01:20:55.910 --> 01:20:55.920 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for the question
 
01:20:58.550 --> 01:20:58.560 align:start position:0%
excellent job going over everything that
 
01:21:01.270 --> 01:21:01.280 align:start position:0%
was discussed one final question on line
 
01:21:03.350 --> 01:21:03.360 align:start position:0%
seven with the anticipated assistance
 
01:21:05.270 --> 01:21:05.280 align:start position:0%
you you gave a great
 
01:21:05.280 --> 01:21:06.070 align:start position:0%
you you gave a great
uh

01:21:06.070 --> 01:21:06.080 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:21:09.270 --> 01:21:09.280 align:start position:0%
description of how that occurs my my
 
01:21:11.750 --> 01:21:11.760 align:start position:0%
question is
 
01:21:15.350 --> 01:21:15.360 align:start position:0%
what is the anticipated timeline from
 
01:21:18.550 --> 01:21:18.560 align:start position:0%
disaster to the time you determine what
 
01:21:19.669 --> 01:21:19.679 align:start position:0%
that is
 
01:21:21.910 --> 01:21:21.920 align:start position:0%
anticipated assistance from fema is
 
01:21:22.950 --> 01:21:22.960 align:start position:0%
going to be
 
01:21:25.030 --> 01:21:25.040 align:start position:0%
sure so i wish i had an easy answer for
 
01:21:25.040 --> 01:21:26.070 align:start position:0%
sure so i wish i had an easy answer for
you

01:21:26.070 --> 01:21:26.080 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:21:28.709 --> 01:21:28.719 align:start position:0%
in part of the situation we're in is a
 
01:21:30.390 --> 01:21:30.400 align:start position:0%
state government administering a federal
 
01:21:32.870 --> 01:21:32.880 align:start position:0%
program so we have to adapt to the
 
01:21:35.030 --> 01:21:35.040 align:start position:0%
federal rules for the program
 
01:21:37.189 --> 01:21:37.199 align:start position:0%
so um depending on the nature of the
 
01:21:37.199 --> 01:21:38.870 align:start position:0%
so um depending on the nature of the
disaster

01:21:38.870 --> 01:21:38.880 align:start position:0%
disaster
 
01:21:40.550 --> 01:21:40.560 align:start position:0%
can really determine how quickly
 
01:21:43.270 --> 01:21:43.280 align:start position:0%
something can be processed so in
 
01:21:45.590 --> 01:21:45.600 align:start position:0%
i believe it's 2018 for example march
 
01:21:47.910 --> 01:21:47.920 align:start position:0%
2018 we had two disasters back to back
 
01:21:49.669 --> 01:21:49.679 align:start position:0%
on the seacoast
 
01:21:51.590 --> 01:21:51.600 align:start position:0%
one was a snow disaster where we had
 
01:21:53.430 --> 01:21:53.440 align:start position:0%
exceptional amounts of snow
 
01:21:55.910 --> 01:21:55.920 align:start position:0%
and emergency work was covered we were
 
01:21:59.030 --> 01:21:59.040 align:start position:0%
able to get that disaster declaration
 
01:22:00.950 --> 01:22:00.960 align:start position:0%
pay out the communities and close out in
 
01:22:03.750 --> 01:22:03.760 align:start position:0%
a two-year span however we have other
 
01:22:05.669 --> 01:22:05.679 align:start position:0%
large natural scale disasters like
 
01:22:07.110 --> 01:22:07.120 align:start position:0%
flooding and things
 
01:22:09.750 --> 01:22:09.760 align:start position:0%
that take years we just are closing out
 
01:22:11.590 --> 01:22:11.600 align:start position:0%
hurricane irene
 
01:22:13.830 --> 01:22:13.840 align:start position:0%
for nine years of work with that because
 
01:22:16.629 --> 01:22:16.639 align:start position:0%
of the severity of it so what we're
 
01:22:18.550 --> 01:22:18.560 align:start position:0%
looking to do right now there's two
 
01:22:20.629 --> 01:22:20.639 align:start position:0%
categories of work essentially
 
01:22:22.550 --> 01:22:22.560 align:start position:0%
with the fema program we have emergency
 
01:22:24.470 --> 01:22:24.480 align:start position:0%
work which are things that are done
 
01:22:26.629 --> 01:22:26.639 align:start position:0%
immediately following the disaster to
 
01:22:30.470 --> 01:22:30.480 align:start position:0%
get to a livable status not perfect and
 
01:22:31.830 --> 01:22:31.840 align:start position:0%
we have our permanent work is where we
 
01:22:34.470 --> 01:22:34.480 align:start position:0%
look at mitigation so the priority right
 
01:22:36.229 --> 01:22:36.239 align:start position:0%
now is getting through our emergency
 
01:22:38.149 --> 01:22:38.159 align:start position:0%
work category so we can get some money
 
01:22:40.390 --> 01:22:40.400 align:start position:0%
to the communities and i know that our
 
01:22:41.830 --> 01:22:41.840 align:start position:0%
staff that's the priority is the
 
01:22:43.110 --> 01:22:43.120 align:start position:0%
emergency work
 
01:22:44.390 --> 01:22:44.400 align:start position:0%
um things
 
01:22:44.400 --> 01:22:45.750 align:start position:0%
um things
so

01:22:45.750 --> 01:22:45.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:22:47.750 --> 01:22:47.760 align:start position:0%
as representative erin said they likely
 
01:22:49.669 --> 01:22:49.679 align:start position:0%
won't see any money until this summer
 
01:22:51.910 --> 01:22:51.920 align:start position:0%
which is a true statement
 
01:22:53.669 --> 01:22:53.679 align:start position:0%
and then the permanent work will come
 
01:22:55.590 --> 01:22:55.600 align:start position:0%
after that as we meet milestones with
 
01:22:56.870 --> 01:22:56.880 align:start position:0%
the projects
 
01:22:59.510 --> 01:22:59.520 align:start position:0%
so it is a lengthy process with fema
 
01:23:01.270 --> 01:23:01.280 align:start position:0%
which is why we were hopeful with this
 
01:23:03.350 --> 01:23:03.360 align:start position:0%
loan with senator guida's work in the
 
01:23:05.430 --> 01:23:05.440 align:start position:0%
previous years that this would be an
 
01:23:07.430 --> 01:23:07.440 align:start position:0%
interim solution so that
 
01:23:09.270 --> 01:23:09.280 align:start position:0%
smaller communities you know could
 
01:23:10.950 --> 01:23:10.960 align:start position:0%
basically still put food on the table
 
01:23:12.790 --> 01:23:12.800 align:start position:0%
and pay their staff but deal with the
 
01:23:12.800 --> 01:23:14.550 align:start position:0%
and pay their staff but deal with the
disasters

01:23:14.550 --> 01:23:14.560 align:start position:0%
disasters
 
01:23:16.550 --> 01:23:16.560 align:start position:0%
so i don't have a hard and fast timeline
 
01:23:19.510 --> 01:23:19.520 align:start position:0%
for you but it is a lengthy process as
 
01:23:23.750 --> 01:23:23.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:26.390 --> 01:23:26.400 align:start position:0%
follow-up yes thank you madam chair so
 
01:23:27.750 --> 01:23:27.760 align:start position:0%
is it
 
01:23:29.750 --> 01:23:29.760 align:start position:0%
fair to say that at a minimum for the
 
01:23:32.070 --> 01:23:32.080 align:start position:0%
emergency portion of the
 
01:23:34.470 --> 01:23:34.480 align:start position:0%
project you're looking at nine months to
 
01:23:40.870 --> 01:23:40.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:42.390 --> 01:23:42.400 align:start position:0%
representative leitchman
 
01:23:43.830 --> 01:23:43.840 align:start position:0%
thanks madam chair i guess i just
 
01:23:45.430 --> 01:23:45.440 align:start position:0%
couldn't sit here any
 
01:23:47.110 --> 01:23:47.120 align:start position:0%
longer after listening to the
 
01:23:49.189 --> 01:23:49.199 align:start position:0%
representative from acworth and her
 
01:23:51.350 --> 01:23:51.360 align:start position:0%
testimony and when you said there's a
 
01:23:51.360 --> 01:23:52.470 align:start position:0%
testimony and when you said there's a
rule

01:23:52.470 --> 01:23:52.480 align:start position:0%
rule
 
01:23:54.870 --> 01:23:54.880 align:start position:0%
that says the dra will assign whatever
 
01:23:56.550 --> 01:23:56.560 align:start position:0%
is not paid back in a follow-up to
 
01:23:59.350 --> 01:23:59.360 align:start position:0%
representative lynn's question how fair
 
01:24:00.950 --> 01:24:00.960 align:start position:0%
is that that a community has been
 
01:24:04.070 --> 01:24:04.080 align:start position:0%
walloped with the 26 million dollars in
 
01:24:04.080 --> 01:24:05.110 align:start position:0%
walloped with the 26 million dollars in
damage

01:24:05.110 --> 01:24:05.120 align:start position:0%
damage
 
01:24:08.470 --> 01:24:08.480 align:start position:0%
they have an operating budget of one 1.3
 
01:24:11.030 --> 01:24:11.040 align:start position:0%
million and then say they take out this
 
01:24:13.189 --> 01:24:13.199 align:start position:0%
loan or another community and they can't
 
01:24:15.189 --> 01:24:15.199 align:start position:0%
come to an agreement with the government
 
01:24:17.430 --> 01:24:17.440 align:start position:0%
the state government and then the dra
 
01:24:19.990 --> 01:24:20.000 align:start position:0%
assesses that on the taxpayers
 
01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:21.669 align:start position:0%
assesses that on the taxpayers
um

01:24:21.669 --> 01:24:21.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:24:24.149 --> 01:24:24.159 align:start position:0%
sure if i may clarify so they would only
 
01:24:26.310 --> 01:24:26.320 align:start position:0%
we would work with the community to do a
 
01:24:28.149 --> 01:24:28.159 align:start position:0%
loan amount that is reasonable to their
 
01:24:28.159 --> 01:24:29.270 align:start position:0%
loan amount that is reasonable to their
damages

01:24:29.270 --> 01:24:29.280 align:start position:0%
damages
 
01:24:31.270 --> 01:24:31.280 align:start position:0%
so um
 
01:24:32.950 --> 01:24:32.960 align:start position:0%
you know if they had three million
 
01:24:35.110 --> 01:24:35.120 align:start position:0%
dollars in damages or roughly around
 
01:24:37.270 --> 01:24:37.280 align:start position:0%
there we wouldn't
 
01:24:38.950 --> 01:24:38.960 align:start position:0%
encourage them to do a loan for 10
 
01:24:41.189 --> 01:24:41.199 align:start position:0%
million so the repayment really comes
 
01:24:42.709 --> 01:24:42.719 align:start position:0%
back to
 
01:24:45.110 --> 01:24:45.120 align:start position:0%
if for some reason the fema eligibility
 
01:24:47.590 --> 01:24:47.600 align:start position:0%
is less than what they took the loan for
 
01:24:49.270 --> 01:24:49.280 align:start position:0%
but we would work with the community to
 
01:24:50.870 --> 01:24:50.880 align:start position:0%
make sure that the loan amount they're
 
01:24:53.350 --> 01:24:53.360 align:start position:0%
requesting is in line with what we
 
01:24:55.350 --> 01:24:55.360 align:start position:0%
believe is eligible or likely to be
 
01:24:55.360 --> 01:24:56.470 align:start position:0%
believe is eligible or likely to be
eligible

01:24:56.470 --> 01:24:56.480 align:start position:0%
eligible
 
01:24:58.310 --> 01:24:58.320 align:start position:0%
so the likelihood that it would need to
 
01:24:58.320 --> 01:24:59.270 align:start position:0%
so the likelihood that it would need to
go

01:24:59.270 --> 01:24:59.280 align:start position:0%
go
 
01:25:02.229 --> 01:25:02.239 align:start position:0%
to the point where dra would um assign
 
01:25:02.239 --> 01:25:03.110 align:start position:0%
to the point where dra would um assign
tasks

01:25:03.110 --> 01:25:03.120 align:start position:0%
tasks
 
01:25:05.830 --> 01:25:05.840 align:start position:0%
i feel would be rare and with the
 
01:25:07.510 --> 01:25:07.520 align:start position:0%
addition of the language
 
01:25:09.350 --> 01:25:09.360 align:start position:0%
in this current amendment where it says
 
01:25:11.350 --> 01:25:11.360 align:start position:0%
the municipality shall not knowingly
 
01:25:13.750 --> 01:25:13.760 align:start position:0%
request a loan for more than what their
 
01:25:15.990 --> 01:25:16.000 align:start position:0%
fema eligibility is that'll help kind of
 
01:25:17.750 --> 01:25:17.760 align:start position:0%
put some guard rails so
 
01:25:19.669 --> 01:25:19.679 align:start position:0%
let's say for example that
 
01:25:22.709 --> 01:25:22.719 align:start position:0%
um backworth were to ask the state for
 
01:25:25.270 --> 01:25:25.280 align:start position:0%
the 2.1 million dollar loan versus the
 
01:25:27.430 --> 01:25:27.440 align:start position:0%
bank that is based on the amount of
 
01:25:29.830 --> 01:25:29.840 align:start position:0%
damages they have completely reasonable
 
01:25:31.350 --> 01:25:31.360 align:start position:0%
and i would expect that fema will
 
01:25:33.590 --> 01:25:33.600 align:start position:0%
reimburse that two million if not much
 
01:25:33.600 --> 01:25:34.550 align:start position:0%
reimburse that two million if not much
more

01:25:34.550 --> 01:25:34.560 align:start position:0%
more
 
01:25:36.149 --> 01:25:36.159 align:start position:0%
so we only would get into the issue
 
01:25:39.270 --> 01:25:39.280 align:start position:0%
where dra would need to tax the town or
 
01:25:41.430 --> 01:25:41.440 align:start position:0%
the residents as if for some reason the
 
01:25:44.470 --> 01:25:44.480 align:start position:0%
fema amount was much less than
 
01:25:46.629 --> 01:25:46.639 align:start position:0%
um what we had originally given them the
 
01:25:48.870 --> 01:25:48.880 align:start position:0%
loan for because what basically right
 
01:25:51.110 --> 01:25:51.120 align:start position:0%
now we have what we think is eligible
 
01:25:52.709 --> 01:25:52.719 align:start position:0%
and i can make a
 
01:25:55.750 --> 01:25:55.760 align:start position:0%
educated decision on that but sometimes
 
01:25:57.189 --> 01:25:57.199 align:start position:0%
there are things that
 
01:25:59.030 --> 01:25:59.040 align:start position:0%
come in that are not eligible for
 
01:26:01.270 --> 01:26:01.280 align:start position:0%
whatever reason we're not done
 
01:26:02.870 --> 01:26:02.880 align:start position:0%
in line with codes and standards or
 
01:26:04.790 --> 01:26:04.800 align:start position:0%
proper procurement or any of those kind
 
01:26:07.510 --> 01:26:07.520 align:start position:0%
of administrative pieces but
 
01:26:10.070 --> 01:26:10.080 align:start position:0%
i don't think we would knowingly or
 
01:26:10.080 --> 01:26:11.669 align:start position:0%
i don't think we would knowingly or
willingly

01:26:11.669 --> 01:26:11.679 align:start position:0%
willingly
 
01:26:13.590 --> 01:26:13.600 align:start position:0%
com you know encourage the community to
 
01:26:16.149 --> 01:26:16.159 align:start position:0%
do a loan that would be far in excess of
 
01:26:18.390 --> 01:26:18.400 align:start position:0%
what fema would look at eligible
 
01:26:21.030 --> 01:26:21.040 align:start position:0%
thanks sure thanks madam chair
 
01:26:22.870 --> 01:26:22.880 align:start position:0%
are there any further questions uh
 
01:26:25.510 --> 01:26:25.520 align:start position:0%
represent lin yes justin sort of follow
 
01:26:28.310 --> 01:26:28.320 align:start position:0%
up to to that i wonder i mean
 
01:26:30.790 --> 01:26:30.800 align:start position:0%
suppose that we that that we were
 
01:26:32.070 --> 01:26:32.080 align:start position:0%
disposed to
 
01:26:33.830 --> 01:26:33.840 align:start position:0%
to change the language of that last
 
01:26:35.189 --> 01:26:35.199 align:start position:0%
section just a little bit and what i'm
 
01:26:37.669 --> 01:26:37.679 align:start position:0%
thinking is suppose instead of saying
 
01:26:39.990 --> 01:26:40.000 align:start position:0%
shall negotiate repayment of the terms
 
01:26:42.070 --> 01:26:42.080 align:start position:0%
we said shall attempt to re
 
01:26:44.310 --> 01:26:44.320 align:start position:0%
uh to negotiate repayment of the terms
 
01:26:46.310 --> 01:26:46.320 align:start position:0%
and then added the following and if the
 
01:26:48.149 --> 01:26:48.159 align:start position:0%
state and the municipality are unable to
 
01:26:50.310 --> 01:26:50.320 align:start position:0%
reach agreement either party may seek
 
01:26:52.310 --> 01:26:52.320 align:start position:0%
resolution of the matter by the superior
 
01:26:54.149 --> 01:26:54.159 align:start position:0%
court which shall decide upon a
 
01:26:55.990 --> 01:26:56.000 align:start position:0%
resolution that is fair and just under
 
01:26:58.470 --> 01:26:58.480 align:start position:0%
all the circumstances would that
 
01:27:00.229 --> 01:27:00.239 align:start position:0%
solve the i mean that would allow the
 
01:27:02.070 --> 01:27:02.080 align:start position:0%
court then to decide
 
01:27:03.910 --> 01:27:03.920 align:start position:0%
you know who should who should win or
 
01:27:05.350 --> 01:27:05.360 align:start position:0%
whether it's appropriate to split the
 
01:27:07.990 --> 01:27:08.000 align:start position:0%
matter somehow that yeah and based on
 
01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:08.709 align:start position:0%
matter somehow that yeah and based on
just

01:27:08.709 --> 01:27:08.719 align:start position:0%
just
 
01:27:10.470 --> 01:27:10.480 align:start position:0%
listening to that i don't see any
 
01:27:11.910 --> 01:27:11.920 align:start position:0%
conflict with any of our federal
 
01:27:13.990 --> 01:27:14.000 align:start position:0%
guidance or anything like that so i
 
01:27:15.669 --> 01:27:15.679 align:start position:0%
think it would be worth pursuing to see
 
01:27:17.910 --> 01:27:17.920 align:start position:0%
if that language would
 
01:27:19.910 --> 01:27:19.920 align:start position:0%
meet what you're looking to do thank you
 
01:27:19.920 --> 01:27:20.709 align:start position:0%
meet what you're looking to do thank you
sure

01:27:20.709 --> 01:27:20.719 align:start position:0%
sure
 
01:27:24.229 --> 01:27:24.239 align:start position:0%
um i do i anybody else
 
01:27:26.709 --> 01:27:26.719 align:start position:0%
represent walls
 
01:27:28.550 --> 01:27:28.560 align:start position:0%
thank you i'm just having a hard time
 
01:27:30.070 --> 01:27:30.080 align:start position:0%
understanding the difference between the
 
01:27:31.910 --> 01:27:31.920 align:start position:0%
18 million that you've approved in the
 
01:27:34.310 --> 01:27:34.320 align:start position:0%
24 or 26 million that aggress said that
 
01:27:37.110 --> 01:27:37.120 align:start position:0%
they have out there is it that they
 
01:27:38.790 --> 01:27:38.800 align:start position:0%
thought that they needed to do things
 
01:27:41.590 --> 01:27:41.600 align:start position:0%
and you didn't think that it fed within
 
01:27:44.310 --> 01:27:44.320 align:start position:0%
federal guidelines sure so um and
 
01:27:46.790 --> 01:27:46.800 align:start position:0%
certainly representative can clarify but
 
01:27:48.550 --> 01:27:48.560 align:start position:0%
what she had mentioned was
 
01:27:51.189 --> 01:27:51.199 align:start position:0%
their engineer had looked at essentially
 
01:27:53.110 --> 01:27:53.120 align:start position:0%
soup to nuts fixing it and making it
 
01:27:54.629 --> 01:27:54.639 align:start position:0%
better to prevent which includes
 
01:27:57.189 --> 01:27:57.199 align:start position:0%
mitigation and right now our 18 million
 
01:27:59.750 --> 01:27:59.760 align:start position:0%
dollars is only the immediate repairs to
 
01:28:02.070 --> 01:28:02.080 align:start position:0%
get it back to the day before the next
 
01:28:04.149 --> 01:28:04.159 align:start position:0%
step is to look at mitigation to improve
 
01:28:06.070 --> 01:28:06.080 align:start position:0%
it so it doesn't happen again and we
 
01:28:07.430 --> 01:28:07.440 align:start position:0%
just haven't gotten there that's not the
 
01:28:09.910 --> 01:28:09.920 align:start position:0%
priority right now it's looking at what
 
01:28:12.790 --> 01:28:12.800 align:start position:0%
is the immediate fix and then our goal
 
01:28:14.709 --> 01:28:14.719 align:start position:0%
is through that process to have
 
01:28:16.950 --> 01:28:16.960 align:start position:0%
mitigation so that things don't
 
01:28:19.110 --> 01:28:19.120 align:start position:0%
happen again um if i make a quick
 
01:28:21.669 --> 01:28:21.679 align:start position:0%
example so in the alstead floods back in
 
01:28:21.679 --> 01:28:23.270 align:start position:0%
example so in the alstead floods back in
2005

01:28:23.270 --> 01:28:23.280 align:start position:0%
2005
 
01:28:25.510 --> 01:28:25.520 align:start position:0%
a similar type of disaster wiped the
 
01:28:27.669 --> 01:28:27.679 align:start position:0%
community off the map but through the
 
01:28:29.510 --> 01:28:29.520 align:start position:0%
public assistance program we were able
 
01:28:31.990 --> 01:28:32.000 align:start position:0%
to do mitigation and these storms that
 
01:28:33.189 --> 01:28:33.199 align:start position:0%
came through
 
01:28:34.870 --> 01:28:34.880 align:start position:0%
those roads and bridges that had
 
01:28:36.790 --> 01:28:36.800 align:start position:0%
mitigation weren't touched and it was
 
01:28:38.629 --> 01:28:38.639 align:start position:0%
the perfect example of the mitigation
 
01:28:38.639 --> 01:28:39.590 align:start position:0%
the perfect example of the mitigation
program

01:28:39.590 --> 01:28:39.600 align:start position:0%
program
 
01:28:41.910 --> 01:28:41.920 align:start position:0%
to show that we invested that money in
 
01:28:44.149 --> 01:28:44.159 align:start position:0%
time to make things better to improve
 
01:28:45.750 --> 01:28:45.760 align:start position:0%
and then they
 
01:28:47.750 --> 01:28:47.760 align:start position:0%
made it out very well in these last
 
01:28:47.760 --> 01:28:50.390 align:start position:0%
made it out very well in these last
storms

01:28:50.390 --> 01:28:50.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:52.229 --> 01:28:52.239 align:start position:0%
follow-up yeah
 
01:28:52.239 --> 01:28:53.189 align:start position:0%
follow-up yeah
so

01:28:53.189 --> 01:28:53.199 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:28:55.189 --> 01:28:55.199 align:start position:0%
in time acworth may see some of that
 
01:28:56.470 --> 01:28:56.480 align:start position:0%
money either through this program or
 
01:28:58.070 --> 01:28:58.080 align:start position:0%
another program but it's going to be
 
01:28:59.750 --> 01:28:59.760 align:start position:0%
mitigation money not repair money it's
 
01:29:02.390 --> 01:29:02.400 align:start position:0%
just a question of what silo it's in and
 
01:29:04.070 --> 01:29:04.080 align:start position:0%
when it comes exactly
 
01:29:07.750 --> 01:29:07.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:11.030 --> 01:29:11.040 align:start position:0%
okay is there any any other questions
 
01:29:12.470 --> 01:29:12.480 align:start position:0%
i do have one
 
01:29:13.669 --> 01:29:13.679 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
01:29:13.679 --> 01:29:14.629 align:start position:0%
and uh
maybe

01:29:14.629 --> 01:29:14.639 align:start position:0%
maybe
 
01:29:16.870 --> 01:29:16.880 align:start position:0%
when we go to our work session is when
 
01:29:19.270 --> 01:29:19.280 align:start position:0%
we can answer it but everybody's talking
 
01:29:21.030 --> 01:29:21.040 align:start position:0%
about small towns
 
01:29:24.470 --> 01:29:24.480 align:start position:0%
but there's nothing in this legislation
 
01:29:24.480 --> 01:29:25.990 align:start position:0%
but there's nothing in this legislation
that

01:29:25.990 --> 01:29:26.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:29:29.510 --> 01:29:29.520 align:start position:0%
is anything about a small town
 
01:29:31.510 --> 01:29:31.520 align:start position:0%
it would appear to me
 
01:29:31.520 --> 01:29:32.790 align:start position:0%
it would appear to me
that

01:29:32.790 --> 01:29:32.800 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:29:35.110 --> 01:29:35.120 align:start position:0%
any town no matter whether you're small
 
01:29:36.950 --> 01:29:36.960 align:start position:0%
or large
 
01:29:38.950 --> 01:29:38.960 align:start position:0%
could apply for this
 
01:29:38.960 --> 01:29:40.310 align:start position:0%
could apply for this
so

01:29:40.310 --> 01:29:40.320 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:29:43.110 --> 01:29:43.120 align:start position:0%
which is it are we trying to address
 
01:29:46.070 --> 01:29:46.080 align:start position:0%
the small towns or are we trying to
 
01:29:49.030 --> 01:29:49.040 align:start position:0%
address the entire state
 
01:29:50.790 --> 01:29:50.800 align:start position:0%
i mean i don't know the answer to that
 
01:29:52.870 --> 01:29:52.880 align:start position:0%
and i'm sure you don't either
 
01:29:54.629 --> 01:29:54.639 align:start position:0%
um i mean
 
01:29:56.149 --> 01:29:56.159 align:start position:0%
that's something
 
01:29:56.159 --> 01:29:57.669 align:start position:0%
that's something
that

01:29:57.669 --> 01:29:57.679 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:29:59.990 --> 01:30:00.000 align:start position:0%
maybe division two can
 
01:30:02.790 --> 01:30:02.800 align:start position:0%
think about a little bit but um
 
01:30:06.310 --> 01:30:06.320 align:start position:0%
you know they're they're too you know
 
01:30:07.990 --> 01:30:08.000 align:start position:0%
two different things here
 
01:30:09.990 --> 01:30:10.000 align:start position:0%
representative amber one item that is in
 
01:30:13.270 --> 01:30:13.280 align:start position:0%
here is the 25 of the town's operating
 
01:30:15.189 --> 01:30:15.199 align:start position:0%
budget which i think for a larger
 
01:30:16.550 --> 01:30:16.560 align:start position:0%
community or city would be an
 
01:30:18.790 --> 01:30:18.800 align:start position:0%
exceptional amount of money which would
 
01:30:21.030 --> 01:30:21.040 align:start position:0%
deem them ineligible for this so that
 
01:30:22.390 --> 01:30:22.400 align:start position:0%
may clarify
 
01:30:24.310 --> 01:30:24.320 align:start position:0%
the piece for it that this is intended
 
01:30:25.910 --> 01:30:25.920 align:start position:0%
for small communities without coming out
 
01:30:27.110 --> 01:30:27.120 align:start position:0%
and saying that
 
01:30:28.950 --> 01:30:28.960 align:start position:0%
um but it is
 
01:30:31.669 --> 01:30:31.679 align:start position:0%
that um in paragraph b
 
01:30:31.679 --> 01:30:32.950 align:start position:0%
that um in paragraph b
the

01:30:32.950 --> 01:30:32.960 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:30:35.669 --> 01:30:35.679 align:start position:0%
incident cost of the projects has to
 
01:30:38.709 --> 01:30:38.719 align:start position:0%
equal or exceed 25 of the amount raised
 
01:30:38.719 --> 01:30:40.070 align:start position:0%
equal or exceed 25 of the amount raised
by

01:30:40.070 --> 01:30:40.080 align:start position:0%
by
 
01:30:42.550 --> 01:30:42.560 align:start position:0%
taxes in the current budget so
 
01:30:45.110 --> 01:30:45.120 align:start position:0%
i would presume that that would exclude
 
01:30:47.110 --> 01:30:47.120 align:start position:0%
many of the larger
 
01:30:49.350 --> 01:30:49.360 align:start position:0%
communities unless they were completely
 
01:30:51.189 --> 01:30:51.199 align:start position:0%
you know devastated but
 
01:30:53.510 --> 01:30:53.520 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure if that helps okay so all
 
01:30:57.430 --> 01:30:57.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:00.070 --> 01:31:00.080 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions
 
01:31:03.030 --> 01:31:03.040 align:start position:0%
all right seeing none
 
01:31:05.750 --> 01:31:05.760 align:start position:0%
the hearing is closed
 
01:31:09.430 --> 01:31:09.440 align:start position:0%
and i believe both division 1
 
01:31:11.430 --> 01:31:11.440 align:start position:0%
and division 2
 
01:31:13.590 --> 01:31:13.600 align:start position:0%
have work sessions
 
01:31:16.470 --> 01:31:16.480 align:start position:0%
so if our division two friends could
 
01:31:17.590 --> 01:31:17.600 align:start position:0%
join us
 
01:31:20.070 --> 01:31:20.080 align:start position:0%
over there we'll take about five minutes
 
01:31:24.790 --> 01:31:24.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:26.149 --> 01:31:26.159 align:start position:0%
oh okay
 
01:31:28.470 --> 01:31:28.480 align:start position:0%
all right i just recessed till after the
 
01:31:51.830 --> 01:31:51.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:54.390 --> 01:31:54.400 align:start position:0%
you could get the difference between
 
01:31:56.149 --> 01:31:56.159 align:start position:0%
doing repair work and doing a
 
01:31:56.159 --> 01:31:57.750 align:start position:0%
doing repair work and doing a
remediation

01:31:57.750 --> 01:31:57.760 align:start position:0%
remediation

to replenish the lead paint hazards
 
03:05:00.950 --> 03:05:00.960 align:start position:0%
remediation fund
 
03:05:03.190 --> 03:05:03.200 align:start position:0%
that is managed by the new hampshire
 
03:05:05.590 --> 03:05:05.600 align:start position:0%
housing finance authority
 
03:05:07.830 --> 03:05:07.840 align:start position:0%
this fund was established three years
 
03:05:07.840 --> 03:05:09.030 align:start position:0%
this fund was established three years
ago

03:05:09.030 --> 03:05:09.040 align:start position:0%
ago
 
03:05:12.070 --> 03:05:12.080 align:start position:0%
to offer zero interest loans to help
 
03:05:13.750 --> 03:05:13.760 align:start position:0%
property owners
 
03:05:16.469 --> 03:05:16.479 align:start position:0%
make housing safe for children
 
03:05:20.309 --> 03:05:20.319 align:start position:0%
by remediating lead paint
 
03:05:22.070 --> 03:05:22.080 align:start position:0%
child care centers
 
03:05:25.750 --> 03:05:25.760 align:start position:0%
are also able to access this loan money
 
03:05:28.790 --> 03:05:28.800 align:start position:0%
to remove lead hazards from drinking
 
03:05:28.800 --> 03:05:30.710 align:start position:0%
to remove lead hazards from drinking
water

03:05:30.710 --> 03:05:30.720 align:start position:0%
water
 
03:05:33.030 --> 03:05:33.040 align:start position:0%
and as this committee knows and i know
 
03:05:34.790 --> 03:05:34.800 align:start position:0%
it's not the policy committee but
 
03:05:37.670 --> 03:05:37.680 align:start position:0%
children exposed to lead dust from old
 
03:05:41.269 --> 03:05:41.279 align:start position:0%
paint can suffer permanent brain damage
 
03:05:43.910 --> 03:05:43.920 align:start position:0%
there is no safe level of lead and new
 
03:05:46.389 --> 03:05:46.399 align:start position:0%
hampshire has some of the oldest
 
03:05:49.349 --> 03:05:49.359 align:start position:0%
housing stock around and it's really all
 
03:05:52.469 --> 03:05:52.479 align:start position:0%
over the state
 
03:05:54.309 --> 03:05:54.319 align:start position:0%
we have
 
03:05:57.990 --> 03:05:58.000 align:start position:0%
close to 500 children in the state who
 
03:05:58.000 --> 03:05:59.190 align:start position:0%
close to 500 children in the state who
have

03:05:59.190 --> 03:05:59.200 align:start position:0%
have
 
03:06:02.230 --> 03:06:02.240 align:start position:0%
been identified as having elevated blood
 
03:06:04.230 --> 03:06:04.240 align:start position:0%
lead levels
 
03:06:04.240 --> 03:06:06.469 align:start position:0%
lead levels
um

03:06:06.469 --> 03:06:06.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:06:08.710 --> 03:06:08.720 align:start position:0%
and that
 
03:06:08.720 --> 03:06:10.230 align:start position:0%
and that
the

03:06:10.230 --> 03:06:10.240 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:06:12.150 --> 03:06:12.160 align:start position:0%
we've seen that in the three years since
 
03:06:14.550 --> 03:06:14.560 align:start position:0%
we've established this
 
03:06:16.070 --> 03:06:16.080 align:start position:0%
loan fund
 
03:06:19.349 --> 03:06:19.359 align:start position:0%
about 300 units of housing
 
03:06:21.750 --> 03:06:21.760 align:start position:0%
have been rehabbed
 
03:06:25.510 --> 03:06:25.520 align:start position:0%
and the fund is now just about depleted
 
03:06:29.030 --> 03:06:29.040 align:start position:0%
but we still have hundreds of children
 
03:06:31.910 --> 03:06:31.920 align:start position:0%
who are at risk of irreparable name
 
03:06:33.510 --> 03:06:33.520 align:start position:0%
brain damage
 
03:06:35.990 --> 03:06:36.000 align:start position:0%
and i should note that the zero interest
 
03:06:39.429 --> 03:06:39.439 align:start position:0%
loans from this fund are repaid when the
 
03:06:43.349 --> 03:06:43.359 align:start position:0%
property is transferred so
 
03:06:45.590 --> 03:06:45.600 align:start position:0%
it could be quickly could be a long time
 
03:06:48.230 --> 03:06:48.240 align:start position:0%
but the money does come back
 
03:06:50.950 --> 03:06:50.960 align:start position:0%
i did have um when i was filing this
 
03:06:53.269 --> 03:06:53.279 align:start position:0%
ballotic conversation
 
03:06:53.279 --> 03:06:54.309 align:start position:0%
ballotic conversation
with

03:06:54.309 --> 03:06:54.319 align:start position:0%
with
 
03:06:54.319 --> 03:06:55.349 align:start position:0%
with
hud

03:06:55.349 --> 03:06:55.359 align:start position:0%
hud
 
03:06:58.150 --> 03:06:58.160 align:start position:0%
to see if the lead in drinking water
 
03:07:01.269 --> 03:07:01.279 align:start position:0%
funds that are in the infrastructure
 
03:07:03.590 --> 03:07:03.600 align:start position:0%
investment act could be used instead of
 
03:07:05.750 --> 03:07:05.760 align:start position:0%
general funds
 
03:07:09.269 --> 03:07:09.279 align:start position:0%
unfortunately that provision those funds
 
03:07:13.269 --> 03:07:13.279 align:start position:0%
are to replace water service lines so
 
03:07:15.670 --> 03:07:15.680 align:start position:0%
the the pipes out
 
03:07:16.950 --> 03:07:16.960 align:start position:0%
on the street
 
03:07:20.950 --> 03:07:20.960 align:start position:0%
not in individual private housing
 
03:07:22.389 --> 03:07:22.399 align:start position:0%
and um
 
03:07:25.510 --> 03:07:25.520 align:start position:0%
this bill came out of senate finance
 
03:07:27.750 --> 03:07:27.760 align:start position:0%
unanimously it passed the senate on a
 
03:07:30.150 --> 03:07:30.160 align:start position:0%
voice vote i hope this committee will
 
03:07:30.160 --> 03:07:31.110 align:start position:0%
voice vote i hope this committee will
agree

agree
 
03:07:32.550 --> 03:07:32.560 align:start position:0%
that we
 
03:07:34.630 --> 03:07:34.640 align:start position:0%
have more work to do to keep children
 
03:07:37.590 --> 03:07:37.600 align:start position:0%

03:07:41.110 --> 03:07:41.120 align:start position:0%

being here today to introduce
 
03:08:44.630 --> 03:08:44.640 align:start position:0%
the bill um
 
03:08:47.190 --> 03:08:47.200 align:start position:0%
we welcome the appropriation uh the
 
03:08:48.870 --> 03:08:48.880 align:start position:0%
additional appropriation to the lead
 
03:08:50.150 --> 03:08:50.160 align:start position:0%
fund which new hampshire housing
 
03:08:50.160 --> 03:08:51.349 align:start position:0%
fund which new hampshire housing
administers

03:08:51.349 --> 03:08:51.359 align:start position:0%
administers
 
03:08:53.349 --> 03:08:53.359 align:start position:0%
the light fund was created as part of
 
03:08:56.309 --> 03:08:56.319 align:start position:0%
the trailer bill in the 2019 biennial
 
03:08:56.319 --> 03:08:57.510 align:start position:0%
the trailer bill in the 2019 biennial
budget

03:08:57.510 --> 03:08:57.520 align:start position:0%
budget
 
03:08:59.269 --> 03:08:59.279 align:start position:0%
and was made part of new hampshire
 
03:09:03.590 --> 03:09:03.600 align:start position:0%
housing's statute which is rsa 204c
 
03:09:04.550 --> 03:09:04.560 align:start position:0%
so it is
 
03:09:07.269 --> 03:09:07.279 align:start position:0%
it's a statutory fund it is a
 
03:09:09.670 --> 03:09:09.680 align:start position:0%
non-lapsing fund so once once the
 
03:09:11.830 --> 03:09:11.840 align:start position:0%
appropriation any appropriation is made
 
03:09:13.670 --> 03:09:13.680 align:start position:0%
by the legislature to the fund it
 
03:09:13.680 --> 03:09:14.710 align:start position:0%
by the legislature to the fund it
becomes

03:09:14.710 --> 03:09:14.720 align:start position:0%
becomes
 
03:09:16.950 --> 03:09:16.960 align:start position:0%
essentially no longer state funds but
 
03:09:18.309 --> 03:09:18.319 align:start position:0%
funds that are administered by new
 
03:09:22.070 --> 03:09:22.080 align:start position:0%
hampshire housing on behalf of the state
 
03:09:23.269 --> 03:09:23.279 align:start position:0%
and we
 
03:09:25.830 --> 03:09:25.840 align:start position:0%
we spend it as as projects are presented
 
03:09:27.190 --> 03:09:27.200 align:start position:0%
to us
 
03:09:29.590 --> 03:09:29.600 align:start position:0%
as senator rosenwald said
 
03:09:32.870 --> 03:09:32.880 align:start position:0%
something on the order of 300 units
 
03:09:35.429 --> 03:09:35.439 align:start position:0%
using the initial 2019 appropriation of
 
03:09:38.389 --> 03:09:38.399 align:start position:0%
3 million dollars have been remediated
 
03:09:38.399 --> 03:09:39.269 align:start position:0%
3 million dollars have been remediated
of

03:09:39.269 --> 03:09:39.279 align:start position:0%
of
 
03:09:41.429 --> 03:09:41.439 align:start position:0%
the lead hazard
 
03:09:43.750 --> 03:09:43.760 align:start position:0%
and that is mostly rental units although
 
03:09:46.630 --> 03:09:46.640 align:start position:0%
we can also use it for
 
03:09:48.630 --> 03:09:48.640 align:start position:0%
low-income single-family
 
03:09:51.750 --> 03:09:51.760 align:start position:0%
owner-occupied residences but most of it
 
03:09:53.830 --> 03:09:53.840 align:start position:0%
is for rental properties and these tend
 
03:09:54.870 --> 03:09:54.880 align:start position:0%
to be
 
03:09:57.429 --> 03:09:57.439 align:start position:0%
a smaller rental property so
 
03:10:00.309 --> 03:10:00.319 align:start position:0%
mom and pop owners if you will
 
03:10:02.229 --> 03:10:02.239 align:start position:0%
and that is the the vast bulk of where
 
03:10:04.389 --> 03:10:04.399 align:start position:0%
this uh these this funding goes so these
 
03:10:07.190 --> 03:10:07.200 align:start position:0%
are these are landlords who don't really
 
03:10:10.229 --> 03:10:10.239 align:start position:0%
have a lot of capital uh available to
 
03:10:12.870 --> 03:10:12.880 align:start position:0%
them to do this very expensive work
 
03:10:13.990 --> 03:10:14.000 align:start position:0%
and so
 
03:10:15.990 --> 03:10:16.000 align:start position:0%
we're there they're owning these
 
03:10:16.000 --> 03:10:17.110 align:start position:0%
we're there they're owning these
properties

03:10:17.110 --> 03:10:17.120 align:start position:0%
properties
 
03:10:19.670 --> 03:10:19.680 align:start position:0%
and renting to low income tenants they
 
03:10:21.349 --> 03:10:21.359 align:start position:0%
don't know the owners don't have the
 
03:10:23.429 --> 03:10:23.439 align:start position:0%
financial wherewithal to perform the
 
03:10:25.590 --> 03:10:25.600 align:start position:0%
remediation of lead paint hazards on the
 
03:10:25.600 --> 03:10:26.710 align:start position:0%
remediation of lead paint hazards on the
property

03:10:26.710 --> 03:10:26.720 align:start position:0%
property
 
03:10:28.309 --> 03:10:28.319 align:start position:0%
this program
 
03:10:30.469 --> 03:10:30.479 align:start position:0%
is a critical resource to helping to
 
03:10:30.479 --> 03:10:31.670 align:start position:0%
is a critical resource to helping to
ensure

03:10:31.670 --> 03:10:31.680 align:start position:0%
ensure
 
03:10:34.389 --> 03:10:34.399 align:start position:0%
the safety of children living in those
 
03:10:36.550 --> 03:10:36.560 align:start position:0%
apartments and also in the single family
 
03:10:36.560 --> 03:10:39.990 align:start position:0%
apartments and also in the single family
homes

03:10:39.990 --> 03:10:40.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:42.070 --> 03:10:42.080 align:start position:0%
this money was the the original fund as
 
03:10:44.070 --> 03:10:44.080 align:start position:0%
i said was created in in 2019 with a
 
03:10:45.590 --> 03:10:45.600 align:start position:0%
three million dollar appropriation by
 
03:10:47.590 --> 03:10:47.600 align:start position:0%
the legislature as part of the uh the
 
03:10:48.710 --> 03:10:48.720 align:start position:0%
trailer bill
 
03:10:48.720 --> 03:10:49.830 align:start position:0%
trailer bill
um

03:10:49.830 --> 03:10:49.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:10:51.670 --> 03:10:51.680 align:start position:0%
to date uh
 
03:10:54.710 --> 03:10:54.720 align:start position:0%
we have uh allocated almost all of those
 
03:10:56.790 --> 03:10:56.800 align:start position:0%
three million dollars in fact we as of
 
03:10:58.150 --> 03:10:58.160 align:start position:0%
today we have
 
03:11:01.389 --> 03:11:01.399 align:start position:0%
um un uh unobligated
 
03:11:03.510 --> 03:11:03.520 align:start position:0%
420 dollars
 
03:11:04.950 --> 03:11:04.960 align:start position:0%
that's it
 
03:11:07.429 --> 03:11:07.439 align:start position:0%
so it's all gone to the projects
 
03:11:09.670 --> 03:11:09.680 align:start position:0%
that are in need of lead paint
 
03:11:09.680 --> 03:11:11.190 align:start position:0%
that are in need of lead paint
remediation

03:11:11.190 --> 03:11:11.200 align:start position:0%
remediation
 
03:11:13.190 --> 03:11:13.200 align:start position:0%
when when i spoke
 
03:11:14.950 --> 03:11:14.960 align:start position:0%
in support of this legislation in the
 
03:11:17.750 --> 03:11:17.760 align:start position:0%
senate finance committee in the hearing
 
03:11:19.590 --> 03:11:19.600 align:start position:0%
i was asked a question about
 
03:11:21.349 --> 03:11:21.359 align:start position:0%
the repayment of the loans because these
 
03:11:23.830 --> 03:11:23.840 align:start position:0%
are only done as loans then and that's
 
03:11:27.030 --> 03:11:27.040 align:start position:0%
um that's by statutory uh requirement we
 
03:11:28.550 --> 03:11:28.560 align:start position:0%
can't do grants
 
03:11:31.349 --> 03:11:31.359 align:start position:0%
uh we would do loans anyway um
 
03:11:31.359 --> 03:11:32.150 align:start position:0%
uh we would do loans anyway um
but

03:11:32.150 --> 03:11:32.160 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:11:34.630 --> 03:11:34.640 align:start position:0%
i was asked well how how long before
 
03:11:37.750 --> 03:11:37.760 align:start position:0%
this becomes a self-sustaining fund
 
03:11:41.030 --> 03:11:41.040 align:start position:0%
i will say it will be a long time before
 
03:11:43.670 --> 03:11:43.680 align:start position:0%
this is a self-sustaining fund
 
03:11:45.670 --> 03:11:45.680 align:start position:0%
in the past couple years we've been
 
03:11:47.990 --> 03:11:48.000 align:start position:0%
running this program three loans have
 
03:11:51.030 --> 03:11:51.040 align:start position:0%
been repaid for a total of fifty four
 
03:11:53.030 --> 03:11:53.040 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars
 
03:11:56.150 --> 03:11:56.160 align:start position:0%
and change so that's really not uh much
 
03:11:58.630 --> 03:11:58.640 align:start position:0%
to keep a program running uh as senator
 
03:12:01.349 --> 03:12:01.359 align:start position:0%
rosenwald said the loans are repaid at
 
03:12:05.590 --> 03:12:05.600 align:start position:0%
the time a property is sold given that
 
03:12:07.670 --> 03:12:07.680 align:start position:0%
landlords tend to hang on to their
 
03:12:09.750 --> 03:12:09.760 align:start position:0%
properties because they are income
 
03:12:11.750 --> 03:12:11.760 align:start position:0%
properties for them these properties
 
03:12:13.030 --> 03:12:13.040 align:start position:0%
don't sell
 
03:12:15.110 --> 03:12:15.120 align:start position:0%
in it on any regular basis they will
 
03:12:17.670 --> 03:12:17.680 align:start position:0%
eventually and so those loans will come
 
03:12:20.950 --> 03:12:20.960 align:start position:0%
back to the fund at some point
 
03:12:20.960 --> 03:12:22.710 align:start position:0%
back to the fund at some point
but

03:12:22.710 --> 03:12:22.720 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:12:25.830 --> 03:12:25.840 align:start position:0%
right now there is extraordinary demand
 
03:12:28.389 --> 03:12:28.399 align:start position:0%
and extraordinary need for
 
03:12:30.229 --> 03:12:30.239 align:start position:0%
the additional work to be done in those
 
03:12:32.630 --> 03:12:32.640 align:start position:0%
properties all over the state
 
03:12:35.190 --> 03:12:35.200 align:start position:0%
where we have lead paint hazards and it
 
03:12:36.630 --> 03:12:36.640 align:start position:0%
is all over the state as senator
 
03:12:37.990 --> 03:12:38.000 align:start position:0%
rosenwald said
 
03:12:40.229 --> 03:12:40.239 align:start position:0%
we have one of the oldest housing stocks
 
03:12:42.630 --> 03:12:42.640 align:start position:0%
in in the country that's just the nature
 
03:12:42.640 --> 03:12:43.670 align:start position:0%
in in the country that's just the nature
of

03:12:43.670 --> 03:12:43.680 align:start position:0%
of
 
03:12:45.349 --> 03:12:45.359 align:start position:0%
where we are and who we are
 
03:12:46.710 --> 03:12:46.720 align:start position:0%
as a state
 
03:12:48.389 --> 03:12:48.399 align:start position:0%
and that means that we have a
 
03:12:50.630 --> 03:12:50.640 align:start position:0%
particularly high incidence of lead
 
03:12:53.750 --> 03:12:53.760 align:start position:0%
paint in existing in these these rental
 
03:12:53.760 --> 03:12:55.269 align:start position:0%
paint in existing in these these rental
properties

03:12:55.269 --> 03:12:55.279 align:start position:0%
properties
 
03:12:56.550 --> 03:12:56.560 align:start position:0%
lead paint was
 
03:12:59.750 --> 03:12:59.760 align:start position:0%
banned by federal law in 1978 and we
 
03:13:03.110 --> 03:13:03.120 align:start position:0%
have an awful lot of pre-1978 structures
 
03:13:05.590 --> 03:13:05.600 align:start position:0%
currently occupied
 
03:13:06.950 --> 03:13:06.960 align:start position:0%
all over the state
 
03:13:08.229 --> 03:13:08.239 align:start position:0%
i will say that
 
03:13:09.349 --> 03:13:09.359 align:start position:0%
just to give a
 
03:13:09.359 --> 03:13:10.870 align:start position:0%
just to give a
a

03:13:10.870 --> 03:13:10.880 align:start position:0%
a
 
03:13:13.510 --> 03:13:13.520 align:start position:0%
a hard number to it
 
03:13:15.110 --> 03:13:15.120 align:start position:0%
we have completed
 
03:13:19.110 --> 03:13:19.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:20.630 --> 03:13:20.640 align:start position:0%
housing units in the state using the
 
03:13:22.630 --> 03:13:22.640 align:start position:0%
state funds that were
 
03:13:24.550 --> 03:13:24.560 align:start position:0%
appropriated a couple years ago and
 
03:13:27.990 --> 03:13:28.000 align:start position:0%
there's another seven that are still uh
 
03:13:31.510 --> 03:13:31.520 align:start position:0%
underway so this is a little under 300
 
03:13:34.389 --> 03:13:34.399 align:start position:0%
units that will have been remediated of
 
03:13:35.830 --> 03:13:35.840 align:start position:0%
lead hazards
 
03:13:37.349 --> 03:13:37.359 align:start position:0%
with the original three million dollars
 
03:13:39.269 --> 03:13:39.279 align:start position:0%
that was made
 
03:13:42.710 --> 03:13:42.720 align:start position:0%
so i'm happy to take any questions
 
03:13:44.550 --> 03:13:44.560 align:start position:0%
before i do that i do want to know we
 
03:13:45.910 --> 03:13:45.920 align:start position:0%
also run
 
03:13:47.910 --> 03:13:47.920 align:start position:0%
the federal
 
03:13:50.630 --> 03:13:50.640 align:start position:0%
lead paint remediation program
 
03:13:50.640 --> 03:13:51.510 align:start position:0%
lead paint remediation program
that's

03:13:51.510 --> 03:13:51.520 align:start position:0%
that's
 
03:13:54.790 --> 03:13:54.800 align:start position:0%
funded by hud and we use the two
 
03:13:57.190 --> 03:13:57.200 align:start position:0%
sources of funding together in fact we
 
03:13:58.870 --> 03:13:58.880 align:start position:0%
leverage the state funds roughly
 
03:14:01.670 --> 03:14:01.680 align:start position:0%
one-to-one with federal funding
 
03:14:04.550 --> 03:14:04.560 align:start position:0%
the federal the the state funding
 
03:14:06.070 --> 03:14:06.080 align:start position:0%
based on the
 
03:14:07.910 --> 03:14:07.920 align:start position:0%
standards that you the legislature
 
03:14:10.710 --> 03:14:10.720 align:start position:0%
established in 2019 are a bit more
 
03:14:12.309 --> 03:14:12.319 align:start position:0%
flexible than the federal funding so
 
03:14:15.670 --> 03:14:15.680 align:start position:0%
there are some properties where
 
03:14:15.680 --> 03:14:16.950 align:start position:0%
there are some properties where
the

03:14:16.950 --> 03:14:16.960 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:14:18.630 --> 03:14:18.640 align:start position:0%
that are not eligible for federal
 
03:14:21.590 --> 03:14:21.600 align:start position:0%
funding that we can use where we can use
 
03:14:23.349 --> 03:14:23.359 align:start position:0%
the state funding
 
03:14:25.269 --> 03:14:25.279 align:start position:0%
but generally speaking
 
03:14:28.150 --> 03:14:28.160 align:start position:0%
most of the uh the work that we do uses
 
03:14:28.160 --> 03:14:29.030 align:start position:0%
most of the uh the work that we do uses
both

03:14:29.030 --> 03:14:29.040 align:start position:0%
both
 
03:14:32.950 --> 03:14:32.960 align:start position:0%
federal and state funding in them
 
03:14:35.269 --> 03:14:35.279 align:start position:0%
i think i'll stop there and be happy to
 
03:14:37.429 --> 03:14:37.439 align:start position:0%
take any questions
 
03:14:39.030 --> 03:14:39.040 align:start position:0%
are there any questions uh
 
03:14:42.469 --> 03:14:42.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:45.269 --> 03:14:45.279 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair just serious uh
 
03:14:47.910 --> 03:14:47.920 align:start position:0%
curious i'm sorry if somebody's um to
 
03:14:50.550 --> 03:14:50.560 align:start position:0%
apply to qualify for a loan does a
 
03:14:52.950 --> 03:14:52.960 align:start position:0%
mitigation effort have to be total
 
03:14:57.030 --> 03:14:57.040 align:start position:0%
removal or do you allow encapsulation uh
 
03:14:58.870 --> 03:14:58.880 align:start position:0%
thank you for that question it's it's a
 
03:15:00.550 --> 03:15:00.560 align:start position:0%
really great question
 
03:15:02.229 --> 03:15:02.239 align:start position:0%
removal of lead
 
03:15:05.510 --> 03:15:05.520 align:start position:0%
would be extraordinarily expensive
 
03:15:08.150 --> 03:15:08.160 align:start position:0%
that is to strip all of the lead paint
 
03:15:09.670 --> 03:15:09.680 align:start position:0%
out of a building
 
03:15:12.309 --> 03:15:12.319 align:start position:0%
would be uh prohibitively expensive and
 
03:15:12.319 --> 03:15:14.070 align:start position:0%
would be uh prohibitively expensive and
so

03:15:14.070 --> 03:15:14.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:15:15.830 --> 03:15:15.840 align:start position:0%
most of the work that is done is
 
03:15:15.840 --> 03:15:17.510 align:start position:0%
most of the work that is done is
encapsulation

03:15:17.510 --> 03:15:17.520 align:start position:0%
encapsulation
 
03:15:19.429 --> 03:15:19.439 align:start position:0%
keeping you know safe
 
03:15:21.830 --> 03:15:21.840 align:start position:0%
covering over the layers or painting so
 
03:15:23.190 --> 03:15:23.200 align:start position:0%
that you have
 
03:15:25.110 --> 03:15:25.120 align:start position:0%
high quality durable paint
 
03:15:27.590 --> 03:15:27.600 align:start position:0%
the issue really with
 
03:15:29.990 --> 03:15:30.000 align:start position:0%
with lead paint for the most part has to
 
03:15:32.870 --> 03:15:32.880 align:start position:0%
do with friction and impact surfaces so
 
03:15:35.349 --> 03:15:35.359 align:start position:0%
windows moving up and down doors opening
 
03:15:37.429 --> 03:15:37.439 align:start position:0%
and closing it's
 
03:15:40.630 --> 03:15:40.640 align:start position:0%
we we have this notion based on the um i
 
03:15:43.269 --> 03:15:43.279 align:start position:0%
remember them the ads from the 1970s
 
03:15:46.309 --> 03:15:46.319 align:start position:0%
late 70s of of young children eating the
 
03:15:47.990 --> 03:15:48.000 align:start position:0%
paint you know taking chips of paint
 
03:15:49.910 --> 03:15:49.920 align:start position:0%
that does happen
 
03:15:52.229 --> 03:15:52.239 align:start position:0%
but actually more often it's the dust
 
03:15:53.910 --> 03:15:53.920 align:start position:0%
that you can't see
 
03:15:55.110 --> 03:15:55.120 align:start position:0%
you can't
 
03:15:55.120 --> 03:15:56.469 align:start position:0%
you can't
feel

03:15:56.469 --> 03:15:56.479 align:start position:0%
feel
 
03:15:59.910 --> 03:15:59.920 align:start position:0%
but a child simply putting
 
03:16:02.229 --> 03:16:02.239 align:start position:0%
his or her hand on a windowsill that has
 
03:16:03.990 --> 03:16:04.000 align:start position:0%
that dust from the window opening and
 
03:16:05.510 --> 03:16:05.520 align:start position:0%
closing and then putting their fingers
 
03:16:06.710 --> 03:16:06.720 align:start position:0%
to the mouse
 
03:16:08.950 --> 03:16:08.960 align:start position:0%
a parent isn't going to see that
 
03:16:11.030 --> 03:16:11.040 align:start position:0%
but it does happen and that's really
 
03:16:13.349 --> 03:16:13.359 align:start position:0%
where the great hazard is so
 
03:16:15.510 --> 03:16:15.520 align:start position:0%
encapsulation is the preferred
 
03:16:15.520 --> 03:16:17.750 align:start position:0%
encapsulation is the preferred
alternative

03:16:17.750 --> 03:16:17.760 align:start position:0%
alternative
 
03:16:19.830 --> 03:16:19.840 align:start position:0%
ideally in in a perfect world with
 
03:16:21.830 --> 03:16:21.840 align:start position:0%
unlimited resources eliminating the lead
 
03:16:23.590 --> 03:16:23.600 align:start position:0%
entirely from the the
 
03:16:25.510 --> 03:16:25.520 align:start position:0%
living environment would be great but
 
03:16:28.229 --> 03:16:28.239 align:start position:0%
it's just too expensive to do
 
03:16:30.950 --> 03:16:30.960 align:start position:0%
thank you represent petrie
 
03:16:32.229 --> 03:16:32.239 align:start position:0%
thank you madam sharon thank you for
 
03:16:33.510 --> 03:16:33.520 align:start position:0%
being here
 
03:16:35.590 --> 03:16:35.600 align:start position:0%
uh what's the typical length of the
 
03:16:38.790 --> 03:16:38.800 align:start position:0%
loans that uh you provide for this uh
 
03:16:38.800 --> 03:16:39.910 align:start position:0%
loans that uh you provide for this uh
service

03:16:39.910 --> 03:16:39.920 align:start position:0%
service
 
03:16:42.870 --> 03:16:42.880 align:start position:0%
uh uh great question uh they the loans
 
03:16:44.790 --> 03:16:44.800 align:start position:0%
last as long as the owner owns the
 
03:16:47.110 --> 03:16:47.120 align:start position:0%
property they there's no term no
 
03:16:48.469 --> 03:16:48.479 align:start position:0%
specific term
 
03:16:50.150 --> 03:16:50.160 align:start position:0%
so as long as the owner owns the
 
03:16:52.229 --> 03:16:52.239 align:start position:0%
property the loan that the lien on the
 
03:16:54.229 --> 03:16:54.239 align:start position:0%
property resides
 
03:16:56.469 --> 03:16:56.479 align:start position:0%
with with that property if the owner
 
03:16:58.389 --> 03:16:58.399 align:start position:0%
sells the property then the loan would
 
03:16:59.750 --> 03:16:59.760 align:start position:0%
be repaid
 
03:17:03.110 --> 03:17:03.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:06.150 --> 03:17:06.160 align:start position:0%
representative debeers
 
03:17:08.389 --> 03:17:08.399 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you madam chair uh i have a
 
03:17:10.309 --> 03:17:10.319 align:start position:0%
question for you i mean what criteria
 
03:17:12.630 --> 03:17:12.640 align:start position:0%
used by huds not to
 
03:17:14.710 --> 03:17:14.720 align:start position:0%
allocate funds for the units i mean
 
03:17:16.309 --> 03:17:16.319 align:start position:0%
there's a disparity between what the
 
03:17:17.910 --> 03:17:17.920 align:start position:0%
state allows for
 
03:17:20.710 --> 03:17:20.720 align:start position:0%
uh you know for mitigation and what hud
 
03:17:22.870 --> 03:17:22.880 align:start position:0%
allows what's the difference in the
 
03:17:22.880 --> 03:17:24.150 align:start position:0%
allows what's the difference in the
units

03:17:24.150 --> 03:17:24.160 align:start position:0%
units
 
03:17:25.910 --> 03:17:25.920 align:start position:0%
it's a very good question and it's a
 
03:17:27.830 --> 03:17:27.840 align:start position:0%
simple difference it's one of income
 
03:17:29.110 --> 03:17:29.120 align:start position:0%
levels so
 
03:17:31.910 --> 03:17:31.920 align:start position:0%
the federal grant uh requires that the
 
03:17:34.389 --> 03:17:34.399 align:start position:0%
property be a rental property be uh
 
03:17:37.830 --> 03:17:37.840 align:start position:0%
occupied by someone uh making uh 80 or
 
03:17:39.429 --> 03:17:39.439 align:start position:0%
less of median
 
03:17:42.150 --> 03:17:42.160 align:start position:0%
area median income the state law allows
 
03:17:44.309 --> 03:17:44.319 align:start position:0%
us to go up to 90 percent of area median
 
03:17:46.710 --> 03:17:46.720 align:start position:0%
income so that little bit of flexibility
 
03:17:48.309 --> 03:17:48.319 align:start position:0%
increases the numbers of properties that
 
03:17:51.030 --> 03:17:51.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:53.110 --> 03:17:53.120 align:start position:0%
did you have a follow-up
 
03:17:56.229 --> 03:17:56.239 align:start position:0%
okay representative walner
 
03:17:58.469 --> 03:17:58.479 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:18:00.469 --> 03:18:00.479 align:start position:0%
my question is how many child care
 
03:18:03.990 --> 03:18:04.000 align:start position:0%
providers have accessed the loans
 
03:18:08.469 --> 03:18:08.479 align:start position:0%
uh again great question um the as
 
03:18:11.750 --> 03:18:11.760 align:start position:0%
created by the legislature this fund can
 
03:18:13.429 --> 03:18:13.439 align:start position:0%
be used in
 
03:18:13.439 --> 03:18:15.269 align:start position:0%
be used in
uh

03:18:15.269 --> 03:18:15.279 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:18:17.990 --> 03:18:18.000 align:start position:0%
income qualified rental properties
 
03:18:20.309 --> 03:18:20.319 align:start position:0%
uh income qualified
 
03:18:23.670 --> 03:18:23.680 align:start position:0%
owner occupied homes or in licensed
 
03:18:25.510 --> 03:18:25.520 align:start position:0%
daycare centers to remediate the lead
 
03:18:27.670 --> 03:18:27.680 align:start position:0%
paint hazards there
 
03:18:29.510 --> 03:18:29.520 align:start position:0%
we have worked with the department of
 
03:18:31.269 --> 03:18:31.279 align:start position:0%
health and human services
 
03:18:34.309 --> 03:18:34.319 align:start position:0%
to make the availability of this funding
 
03:18:36.710 --> 03:18:36.720 align:start position:0%
source known to licensed daycare
 
03:18:36.720 --> 03:18:37.830 align:start position:0%
source known to licensed daycare
facilities

03:18:37.830 --> 03:18:37.840 align:start position:0%
facilities
 
03:18:39.269 --> 03:18:39.279 align:start position:0%
but to date
 
03:18:40.790 --> 03:18:40.800 align:start position:0%
none of them
 
03:18:43.110 --> 03:18:43.120 align:start position:0%
have expressed an interest in doing that
 
03:18:44.950 --> 03:18:44.960 align:start position:0%
i i suspect
 
03:18:47.429 --> 03:18:47.439 align:start position:0%
that is because in order to get a
 
03:18:50.790 --> 03:18:50.800 align:start position:0%
license the facility has to be in good
 
03:18:53.269 --> 03:18:53.279 align:start position:0%
repair which means you wouldn't need to
 
03:18:57.030 --> 03:18:57.040 align:start position:0%
do the encapsulation of the lead paint i
 
03:18:59.830 --> 03:18:59.840 align:start position:0%
i that's a guess on my part but i think
 
03:19:04.389 --> 03:19:04.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:06.790 --> 03:19:06.800 align:start position:0%
patch did you have a follow-up
 
03:19:08.070 --> 03:19:08.080 align:start position:0%
you're all set
 
03:19:10.469 --> 03:19:10.479 align:start position:0%
are there any uh representative lin
 
03:19:12.229 --> 03:19:12.239 align:start position:0%
yes i wonder if you could tell me with
 
03:19:14.950 --> 03:19:14.960 align:start position:0%
regard to the um the properties that are
 
03:19:17.590 --> 03:19:17.600 align:start position:0%
not owner occupied that is rented you
 
03:19:19.990 --> 03:19:20.000 align:start position:0%
you mentioned that there's an income
 
03:19:22.070 --> 03:19:22.080 align:start position:0%
limit on the tenants
 
03:19:24.309 --> 03:19:24.319 align:start position:0%
is there any income limit on the owner
 
03:19:27.269 --> 03:19:27.279 align:start position:0%
of the property there is not
 
03:19:28.469 --> 03:19:28.479 align:start position:0%
so a
 
03:19:31.429 --> 03:19:31.439 align:start position:0%
a sort of a large corporation that has
 
03:19:34.469 --> 03:19:34.479 align:start position:0%
lots and lots of rental units
 
03:19:36.229 --> 03:19:36.239 align:start position:0%
could qualify for this
 
03:19:38.710 --> 03:19:38.720 align:start position:0%
that is possible they could qualify but
 
03:19:41.429 --> 03:19:41.439 align:start position:0%
i'll repeat what i said earlier
 
03:19:44.150 --> 03:19:44.160 align:start position:0%
most of the units that are have been
 
03:19:46.070 --> 03:19:46.080 align:start position:0%
remediated using the state funds have
 
03:19:48.469 --> 03:19:48.479 align:start position:0%
been small owners
 
03:19:49.670 --> 03:19:49.680 align:start position:0%
we have done
 
03:19:52.630 --> 03:19:52.640 align:start position:0%
i think a couple of units with
 
03:19:54.790 --> 03:19:54.800 align:start position:0%
the owner elm grove which is a
 
03:19:56.469 --> 03:19:56.479 align:start position:0%
large rental property owner in the
 
03:19:58.710 --> 03:19:58.720 align:start position:0%
manchester area but they're expanding
 
03:20:01.910 --> 03:20:01.920 align:start position:0%
but very few actually a very small
 
03:20:06.950 --> 03:20:06.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:09.830 --> 03:20:09.840 align:start position:0%
are there any further uh representative
 
03:20:11.670 --> 03:20:11.680 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you sir for
 
03:20:14.550 --> 03:20:14.560 align:start position:0%
being here uh just four really quick
 
03:20:17.590 --> 03:20:17.600 align:start position:0%
individual questions all related are is
 
03:20:19.750 --> 03:20:19.760 align:start position:0%
interest paid on the loans no interest
 
03:20:22.790 --> 03:20:22.800 align:start position:0%
no interest um
 
03:20:24.229 --> 03:20:24.239 align:start position:0%
and i'm assuming it's a balloon payment
 
03:20:26.870 --> 03:20:26.880 align:start position:0%
at the end when it's sold yes
 
03:20:31.429 --> 03:20:31.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:33.750 --> 03:20:33.760 align:start position:0%
yes they could be um so
 
03:20:36.790 --> 03:20:36.800 align:start position:0%
and and that's that would be at um
 
03:20:39.190 --> 03:20:39.200 align:start position:0%
uh our discretion new hampshire housing
 
03:20:42.389 --> 03:20:42.399 align:start position:0%
so say for example a
 
03:20:44.870 --> 03:20:44.880 align:start position:0%
a property owner because of shifts in
 
03:20:46.790 --> 03:20:46.800 align:start position:0%
the market
 
03:20:48.790 --> 03:20:48.800 align:start position:0%
what was under water with a mortgage
 
03:20:50.870 --> 03:20:50.880 align:start position:0%
they didn't have any equity
 
03:20:52.229 --> 03:20:52.239 align:start position:0%
in the property and they were selling
 
03:20:53.830 --> 03:20:53.840 align:start position:0%
the property
 
03:20:55.590 --> 03:20:55.600 align:start position:0%
in that kind of situation we would
 
03:20:58.150 --> 03:20:58.160 align:start position:0%
forgive the loan
 
03:21:00.070 --> 03:21:00.080 align:start position:0%
and the final one um
 
03:21:01.990 --> 03:21:02.000 align:start position:0%
you mentioned a transfer ownership let's
 
03:21:04.469 --> 03:21:04.479 align:start position:0%
say i owned a four unit and it was in my
 
03:21:06.790 --> 03:21:06.800 align:start position:0%
wife and i's name and i we decided to
 
03:21:08.550 --> 03:21:08.560 align:start position:0%
put it into a trust would that qualify
 
03:21:10.229 --> 03:21:10.239 align:start position:0%
as a transfer that would be a transfer
 
03:21:13.030 --> 03:21:13.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:15.670 --> 03:21:15.680 align:start position:0%
representative erf
 
03:21:17.830 --> 03:21:17.840 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
03:21:21.190 --> 03:21:21.200 align:start position:0%
are the federal funds loans or grants
 
03:21:23.670 --> 03:21:23.680 align:start position:0%
it's a combination but typically done as
 
03:21:23.680 --> 03:21:24.630 align:start position:0%
it's a combination but typically done as
loans

03:21:24.630 --> 03:21:24.640 align:start position:0%
loans
 
03:21:26.950 --> 03:21:26.960 align:start position:0%
and what are the terms of those loans at
 
03:21:28.550 --> 03:21:28.560 align:start position:0%
the same terms they stay with the
 
03:21:30.630 --> 03:21:30.640 align:start position:0%
property uh until the property is
 
03:21:34.469 --> 03:21:34.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:36.469 --> 03:21:36.479 align:start position:0%
they that's why these the funds work
 
03:21:39.910 --> 03:21:39.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:41.110 --> 03:21:41.120 align:start position:0%
are there any
 
03:21:43.030 --> 03:21:43.040 align:start position:0%
reps oh sorry representative turcotte
 
03:21:44.410 --> 03:21:44.420 align:start position:0%
you had your chance
 
03:21:44.420 --> 03:21:46.229 align:start position:0%
you had your chance
[Laughter]

03:21:46.229 --> 03:21:46.239 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
03:21:46.239 --> 03:21:47.910 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
follow-up

follow-up
 
03:21:49.590 --> 03:21:49.600 align:start position:0%
um go ahead
 
03:21:51.670 --> 03:21:51.680 align:start position:0%
on the forgiven question that you said
 
03:21:51.680 --> 03:21:52.389 align:start position:0%
on the forgiven question that you said
yes

03:21:52.389 --> 03:21:52.399 align:start position:0%

03:21:58.950 --> 03:21:58.960 align:start position:0%
i
 
03:22:01.510 --> 03:22:01.520 align:start position:0%
we've only been running the state funded
 
03:22:03.670 --> 03:22:03.680 align:start position:0%
program for a couple years and i don't
 
03:22:06.229 --> 03:22:06.239 align:start position:0%
think we've had need to forgive that
 
03:22:07.830 --> 03:22:07.840 align:start position:0%
we've not been requested to give any
 
03:22:09.670 --> 03:22:09.680 align:start position:0%
loans i'd have to go back and check to
 
03:22:11.349 --> 03:22:11.359 align:start position:0%
see if we've forgiven any of the federal
 
03:22:15.590 --> 03:22:15.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:17.750 --> 03:22:17.760 align:start position:0%
representative waltz
 
03:22:19.590 --> 03:22:19.600 align:start position:0%
okay man i'm
 
03:22:21.590 --> 03:22:21.600 align:start position:0%
to follow up on what representative lim
 
03:22:23.670 --> 03:22:23.680 align:start position:0%
hit upon and that is the idea that big
 
03:22:25.110 --> 03:22:25.120 align:start position:0%
corporations could take advantage of
 
03:22:27.190 --> 03:22:27.200 align:start position:0%
this if we were to put a limitation in
 
03:22:28.870 --> 03:22:28.880 align:start position:0%
here eliminating it so that big
 
03:22:31.110 --> 03:22:31.120 align:start position:0%
corporations you know big residential
 
03:22:33.269 --> 03:22:33.279 align:start position:0%
groups could not take advantage of it
 
03:22:35.510 --> 03:22:35.520 align:start position:0%
would that be a problem would that have
 
03:22:40.150 --> 03:22:40.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:42.790 --> 03:22:42.800 align:start position:0%
i suppose it would depend on
 
03:22:42.800 --> 03:22:44.070 align:start position:0%
i suppose it would depend on
how

03:22:44.070 --> 03:22:44.080 align:start position:0%
how
 
03:22:46.229 --> 03:22:46.239 align:start position:0%
the limitations were worded
 
03:22:48.469 --> 03:22:48.479 align:start position:0%
i and i i i guess i would i would need
 
03:22:49.990 --> 03:22:50.000 align:start position:0%
to see the language in order to be able
 
03:22:51.429 --> 03:22:51.439 align:start position:0%
to say whether it would be difficult or
 
03:22:51.439 --> 03:22:52.469 align:start position:0%
to say whether it would be difficult or
easy

03:22:52.469 --> 03:22:52.479 align:start position:0%
easy
 
03:22:55.269 --> 03:22:55.279 align:start position:0%
um i i will just say in response to both
 
03:22:56.870 --> 03:22:56.880 align:start position:0%
your question and representative lynn's
 
03:22:59.510 --> 03:22:59.520 align:start position:0%
question most of this goes to the the
 
03:23:04.710 --> 03:23:04.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:06.309 --> 03:23:06.319 align:start position:0%
thank you for representing that
 
03:23:08.630 --> 03:23:08.640 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair along with that uh
 
03:23:10.070 --> 03:23:10.080 align:start position:0%
train of thought
 
03:23:12.469 --> 03:23:12.479 align:start position:0%
i don't know that it's relevant
 
03:23:14.469 --> 03:23:14.479 align:start position:0%
how large the corporation is or how
 
03:23:17.030 --> 03:23:17.040 align:start position:0%
large or wealthy the entity is that owns
 
03:23:19.510 --> 03:23:19.520 align:start position:0%
a property the purpose of this program
 
03:23:21.750 --> 03:23:21.760 align:start position:0%
is to mitigate lead poisoning
 
03:23:25.269 --> 03:23:25.279 align:start position:0%
in youth and as you stated many times a
 
03:23:29.190 --> 03:23:29.200 align:start position:0%
proponents of the loans go towards
 
03:23:31.349 --> 03:23:31.359 align:start position:0%
relatively low rent properties or
 
03:23:33.269 --> 03:23:33.279 align:start position:0%
section 8 properties or that type of
 
03:23:34.309 --> 03:23:34.319 align:start position:0%
thing so
 
03:23:36.870 --> 03:23:36.880 align:start position:0%
um i don't know why that's even matters
 
03:23:38.229 --> 03:23:38.239 align:start position:0%
it doesn't really add value to the
 
03:23:40.550 --> 03:23:40.560 align:start position:0%
property that much thank you
 
03:23:42.389 --> 03:23:42.399 align:start position:0%
i'll i'll take that as a question and
 
03:23:45.349 --> 03:23:45.359 align:start position:0%
say yes
 
03:23:47.830 --> 03:23:47.840 align:start position:0%
are there any further questions
 
03:23:50.710 --> 03:23:50.720 align:start position:0%
i do have one question mr frost and that
 
03:23:50.720 --> 03:23:51.830 align:start position:0%
i do have one question mr frost and that
is

03:23:51.830 --> 03:23:51.840 align:start position:0%
is
 
03:23:54.389 --> 03:23:54.399 align:start position:0%
do you have a waiting list at this point
 
03:23:54.399 --> 03:23:55.269 align:start position:0%
do you have a waiting list at this point
of

03:23:55.269 --> 03:23:55.279 align:start position:0%
of
 
03:23:57.590 --> 03:23:57.600 align:start position:0%
people that are
 
03:23:59.750 --> 03:23:59.760 align:start position:0%
waiting for this
 
03:23:59.760 --> 03:24:01.110 align:start position:0%
waiting for this
appropriation

03:24:01.110 --> 03:24:01.120 align:start position:0%
appropriation
 
03:24:03.750 --> 03:24:03.760 align:start position:0%
we do i but i regret i don't i don't
 
03:24:06.229 --> 03:24:06.239 align:start position:0%
know how long that waiting list is
 
03:24:10.309 --> 03:24:10.319 align:start position:0%
uh what i'll say right now is the um
 
03:24:12.469 --> 03:24:12.479 align:start position:0%
the program capacity
 
03:24:14.630 --> 03:24:14.640 align:start position:0%
is limited not by
 
03:24:14.640 --> 03:24:16.150 align:start position:0%
is limited not by
demand

03:24:16.150 --> 03:24:16.160 align:start position:0%
demand
 
03:24:18.870 --> 03:24:18.880 align:start position:0%
but by the availability of contractors
 
03:24:22.309 --> 03:24:22.319 align:start position:0%
so we we could run a bigger program
 
03:24:24.870 --> 03:24:24.880 align:start position:0%
with more funds
 
03:24:27.429 --> 03:24:27.439 align:start position:0%
subject to what you choose to to
 
03:24:27.439 --> 03:24:28.870 align:start position:0%
subject to what you choose to to
appropriate

03:24:28.870 --> 03:24:28.880 align:start position:0%
appropriate
 
03:24:31.429 --> 03:24:31.439 align:start position:0%
um but the the real limiting factor is
 
03:24:33.110 --> 03:24:33.120 align:start position:0%
the availability of contractors to do
 
03:24:34.070 --> 03:24:34.080 align:start position:0%
the work
 
03:24:35.910 --> 03:24:35.920 align:start position:0%
and and by contractors i mean
 
03:24:38.150 --> 03:24:38.160 align:start position:0%
contractors who are trained and
 
03:24:38.160 --> 03:24:39.349 align:start position:0%
contractors who are trained and
certified

03:24:39.349 --> 03:24:39.359 align:start position:0%
certified
 
03:24:41.830 --> 03:24:41.840 align:start position:0%
to do lead paint remediation which is a
 
03:24:44.150 --> 03:24:44.160 align:start position:0%
very specialized
 
03:24:48.070 --> 03:24:48.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:50.950 --> 03:24:50.960 align:start position:0%
thank you very much um
 
03:24:53.349 --> 03:24:53.359 align:start position:0%

list of 35 other states with an adult
 
03:27:54.830 --> 03:27:54.840 align:start position:0%
dental benefit for

medicaid not only will this benefit
 
03:27:59.269 --> 03:27:59.279 align:start position:0%
improve the health

of the adult medicaid population it will
 
03:28:05.830 --> 03:28:05.840 align:start position:0%
also save money upstream in medicaid on
 
03:28:08.309 --> 03:28:08.319 align:start position:0%
other health treatments right now we

03:28:16.469 --> 03:28:16.479 align:start position:0%
only
 
03:28:19.670 --> 03:28:19.680 align:start position:0%
current adult benefit along with other
 
03:28:22.870 --> 03:28:22.880 align:start position:0%
treatments to to fight illnesses
 
03:28:26.630 --> 03:28:26.640 align:start position:0%
that come along from poor oral health
 
03:28:29.750 --> 03:28:29.760 align:start position:0%
i would note that this bill is funded
 
03:28:32.710 --> 03:28:32.720 align:start position:0%
um with most of the centene
 
03:28:34.710 --> 03:28:34.720 align:start position:0%
settlement money
 
03:28:36.950 --> 03:28:36.960 align:start position:0%
directed to the benefit
 
03:28:39.510 --> 03:28:39.520 align:start position:0%
and the the i know that
 
03:28:40.790 --> 03:28:40.800 align:start position:0%
this committee
 
03:28:44.630 --> 03:28:44.640 align:start position:0%
worked really hard on house bill 103.
 
03:28:47.830 --> 03:28:47.840 align:start position:0%
the senate bill's language is a little
 
03:28:51.830 --> 03:28:51.840 align:start position:0%
different on the sentine settlement
 
03:28:53.590 --> 03:28:53.600 align:start position:0%
because it includes language
 
03:28:53.600 --> 03:28:55.229 align:start position:0%
because it includes language
appropriating

03:28:55.229 --> 03:28:55.239 align:start position:0%
appropriating
 
03:28:58.309 --> 03:28:58.319 align:start position:0%
2.4 million dollars of the centene
 
03:28:58.319 --> 03:28:59.750 align:start position:0%
2.4 million dollars of the centene
settlement

03:28:59.750 --> 03:28:59.760 align:start position:0%
settlement
 
03:29:01.269 --> 03:29:01.279 align:start position:0%
to repay
 
03:29:01.279 --> 03:29:02.710 align:start position:0%
to repay
cms

03:29:02.710 --> 03:29:02.720 align:start position:0%
cms
 
03:29:04.950 --> 03:29:04.960 align:start position:0%
on the risk corridor
 
03:29:07.269 --> 03:29:07.279 align:start position:0%
program and
 
03:29:09.110 --> 03:29:09.120 align:start position:0%
for details on
 
03:29:12.309 --> 03:29:12.319 align:start position:0%
exactly why we have to repay cms i would
 
03:29:15.269 --> 03:29:15.279 align:start position:0%
ask you to ask the department
 
03:29:18.630 --> 03:29:18.640 align:start position:0%
but the department does need that 2.4
 
03:29:21.510 --> 03:29:21.520 align:start position:0%
million dollars for that purpose
 
03:29:25.190 --> 03:29:25.200 align:start position:0%
and um so i hope the committee
 
03:29:25.200 --> 03:29:25.990 align:start position:0%
and um so i hope the committee
will

03:29:25.990 --> 03:29:26.000 align:start position:0%
will
 
03:29:26.000 --> 03:29:27.110 align:start position:0%
will
adopt

03:29:27.110 --> 03:29:27.120 align:start position:0%
adopt
 
03:29:27.120 --> 03:29:28.229 align:start position:0%
adopt
this

03:29:28.229 --> 03:29:28.239 align:start position:0%
this
 
03:29:30.469 --> 03:29:30.479 align:start position:0%
senate's language
 
03:29:30.479 --> 03:29:31.510 align:start position:0%
senate's language
and

03:29:31.510 --> 03:29:31.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:29:34.150 --> 03:29:34.160 align:start position:0%
as opposed to taking it to what you did
 
03:29:37.510 --> 03:29:37.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:40.150 --> 03:29:40.160 align:start position:0%
the senate health committee which has
 
03:29:43.510 --> 03:29:43.520 align:start position:0%
house bill 103
 
03:29:45.830 --> 03:29:45.840 align:start position:0%
is also considering
 
03:29:48.389 --> 03:29:48.399 align:start position:0%
slightly different language on the cost
 
03:29:48.399 --> 03:29:49.830 align:start position:0%
slightly different language on the cost
sharing

03:29:49.830 --> 03:29:49.840 align:start position:0%
sharing
 
03:29:49.840 --> 03:29:50.870 align:start position:0%
sharing
that

03:29:50.870 --> 03:29:50.880 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:29:54.309 --> 03:29:54.319 align:start position:0%
the house put into house bill 103
 
03:29:55.990 --> 03:29:56.000 align:start position:0%
and that is to
 
03:29:57.750 --> 03:29:57.760 align:start position:0%
carve out
 
03:30:02.070 --> 03:30:02.080 align:start position:0%
preventive and diagnostic services
 
03:30:04.630 --> 03:30:04.640 align:start position:0%
from the cost sharing
 
03:30:06.790 --> 03:30:06.800 align:start position:0%
this was suggested by the clinical
 
03:30:08.870 --> 03:30:08.880 align:start position:0%
dental community and i think it makes
 
03:30:08.880 --> 03:30:09.910 align:start position:0%
dental community and i think it makes
sense

03:30:09.910 --> 03:30:09.920 align:start position:0%
sense
 
03:30:13.269 --> 03:30:13.279 align:start position:0%
to avoid financial barriers for patients
 
03:30:15.510 --> 03:30:15.520 align:start position:0%
that could inadvertently
 
03:30:18.870 --> 03:30:18.880 align:start position:0%
lead to increased unnecessarily
 
03:30:18.880 --> 03:30:20.389 align:start position:0%
lead to increased unnecessarily
increased

03:30:20.389 --> 03:30:20.399 align:start position:0%
increased
 
03:30:24.309 --> 03:30:24.319 align:start position:0%
cost of the program
 
03:30:27.670 --> 03:30:27.680 align:start position:0%
it's i think senator bradley may have
 
03:30:29.429 --> 03:30:29.439 align:start position:0%
already shared
 
03:30:31.429 --> 03:30:31.439 align:start position:0%
his language
 
03:30:33.670 --> 03:30:33.680 align:start position:0%
with this committee
 
03:30:37.110 --> 03:30:37.120 align:start position:0%
but i have a copy of it with me today if
 
03:30:38.469 --> 03:30:38.479 align:start position:0%
he hasn't
 
03:30:41.190 --> 03:30:41.200 align:start position:0%
so those are the two
 
03:30:43.190 --> 03:30:43.200 align:start position:0%
biggest differences
 
03:30:47.269 --> 03:30:47.279 align:start position:0%
between the language and senate bill 422
 
03:30:49.830 --> 03:30:49.840 align:start position:0%
and house bill 103 is amended by the
 
03:30:49.840 --> 03:30:51.349 align:start position:0%
and house bill 103 is amended by the
house

03:30:51.349 --> 03:30:51.359 align:start position:0%
house
 
03:30:53.670 --> 03:30:53.680 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
03:30:55.830 --> 03:30:55.840 align:start position:0%
you're quite welcome and i
 
03:31:00.070 --> 03:31:00.080 align:start position:0%
i think our goal is to um
 
03:31:05.190 --> 03:31:05.200 align:start position:0%
produce one bill that that satisfies
 
03:31:08.150 --> 03:31:08.160 align:start position:0%
everybody so we're not uh
 
03:31:10.710 --> 03:31:10.720 align:start position:0%
we're not obviously not opposed to this
 
03:31:12.389 --> 03:31:12.399 align:start position:0%
because we already
 
03:31:14.790 --> 03:31:14.800 align:start position:0%
have passed it on the house floor
 
03:31:17.830 --> 03:31:17.840 align:start position:0%
and so it's just a matter of trying to
 
03:31:19.830 --> 03:31:19.840 align:start position:0%
work together to
 
03:31:22.309 --> 03:31:22.319 align:start position:0%
make sure that our languages our
 
03:31:22.319 --> 03:31:24.469 align:start position:0%
make sure that our languages our
language

03:31:24.469 --> 03:31:24.479 align:start position:0%
language
 
03:31:26.790 --> 03:31:26.800 align:start position:0%
relate is is the same
 
03:31:30.469 --> 03:31:30.479 align:start position:0%
so right okay um
 
03:31:33.590 --> 03:31:33.600 align:start position:0%
thank you very much senator thank you
 
03:31:50.150 --> 03:31:50.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:52.150 --> 03:31:52.160 align:start position:0%
good afternoon good afternoon uh
 
03:31:54.229 --> 03:31:54.239 align:start position:0%
courtney i would just like to remind you
 
03:31:56.950 --> 03:31:56.960 align:start position:0%
that both the house and the senate have
 
03:31:58.550 --> 03:31:58.560 align:start position:0%
passed a bill
 
03:32:00.870 --> 03:32:00.880 align:start position:0%
and there's only a very few minor
 
03:32:00.880 --> 03:32:02.070 align:start position:0%
and there's only a very few minor
differences

03:32:02.070 --> 03:32:02.080 align:start position:0%
differences
 
03:32:04.550 --> 03:32:04.560 align:start position:0%
so we don't need to go into the why
 
03:32:07.510 --> 03:32:07.520 align:start position:0%
understood okay we all understand the
 
03:32:07.520 --> 03:32:08.710 align:start position:0%
understood okay we all understand the
why

03:32:08.710 --> 03:32:08.720 align:start position:0%
why
 
03:32:09.750 --> 03:32:09.760 align:start position:0%

the bills are different but i'll just

say that ultimately
 
03:32:35.110 --> 03:32:35.120 align:start position:0%
while we prefer the senate bill at
 
03:32:36.469 --> 03:32:36.479 align:start position:0%
northeast delta dental because of the
 
03:32:38.469 --> 03:32:38.479 align:start position:0%
additional benefits it provides
 
03:32:40.630 --> 03:32:40.640 align:start position:0%
ultimately we'd be in support of either
 
03:32:44.309 --> 03:32:44.319 align:start position:0%
house bill 103 or senate bill 422 and
 
03:32:46.389 --> 03:32:46.399 align:start position:0%
it's just time for us to get these adult
 
03:32:48.950 --> 03:32:48.960 align:start position:0%
dental benefits a reality
 
03:32:51.110 --> 03:32:51.120 align:start position:0%

society and its 1100
 
03:34:41.429 --> 03:34:41.439 align:start position:0%
members uh including dentists and other
 
03:34:44.550 --> 03:34:44.560 align:start position:0%
dental professionals um
 
03:34:46.070 --> 03:34:46.080 align:start position:0%
no need to really go through this in
 
03:34:47.910 --> 03:34:47.920 align:start position:0%
detail i think
 
03:34:49.510 --> 03:34:49.520 align:start position:0%
for several years the new hampshire
 
03:34:52.950 --> 03:34:52.960 align:start position:0%
dental society has been on record
 
03:34:56.309 --> 03:34:56.319 align:start position:0%
working uh through the hb4 working group
 
03:34:59.510 --> 03:34:59.520 align:start position:0%
to help design this benefit
 
03:35:01.429 --> 03:35:01.439 align:start position:0%
we've been incredibly pleased with the
 
03:35:04.389 --> 03:35:04.399 align:start position:0%
work you all have done
 
03:35:06.309 --> 03:35:06.319 align:start position:0%
in designing
 
03:35:08.950 --> 03:35:08.960 align:start position:0%
hb 103
 
03:35:12.150 --> 03:35:12.160 align:start position:0%
the dental society supports both bills
 
03:35:12.160 --> 03:35:13.830 align:start position:0%
the dental society supports both bills
um

03:35:13.830 --> 03:35:13.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:35:15.429 --> 03:35:15.439 align:start position:0%
you know we think that there are
 
03:35:15.439 --> 03:35:16.950 align:start position:0%
you know we think that there are
significant

03:35:16.950 --> 03:35:16.960 align:start position:0%
significant
 
03:35:19.670 --> 03:35:19.680 align:start position:0%
public health reasons and economic
 
03:35:23.349 --> 03:35:23.359 align:start position:0%
benefits that will result
 
03:35:25.590 --> 03:35:25.600 align:start position:0%
uh with the creation of an adult dental
 
03:35:28.710 --> 03:35:28.720 align:start position:0%
benefit um we also believe
 
03:35:31.269 --> 03:35:31.279 align:start position:0%
passing that will
 
03:35:34.070 --> 03:35:34.080 align:start position:0%
have a positive impact on dentist
 
03:35:37.429 --> 03:35:37.439 align:start position:0%
participation in medicaid which uh very
 
03:35:39.510 --> 03:35:39.520 align:start position:0%
right now is very low
 
03:35:41.830 --> 03:35:41.840 align:start position:0%
part of that is because we only have
 
03:35:43.510 --> 03:35:43.520 align:start position:0%
children's medicaid
 
03:35:46.150 --> 03:35:46.160 align:start position:0%
and many of the policy changes that you
 
03:35:47.750 --> 03:35:47.760 align:start position:0%
all have worked on
 
03:35:49.750 --> 03:35:49.760 align:start position:0%
in house bill 103
 
03:35:52.950 --> 03:35:52.960 align:start position:0%
uh which you see in this bill
 
03:35:55.590 --> 03:35:55.600 align:start position:0%
we are confident will increase that
 
03:35:57.349 --> 03:35:57.359 align:start position:0%
participation level
 
03:35:59.670 --> 03:35:59.680 align:start position:0%
and it's not just medicaid reimbursement
 
03:36:01.670 --> 03:36:01.680 align:start position:0%
rates it's also
 
03:36:05.429 --> 03:36:05.439 align:start position:0%
care coordination minimizing bureaucracy
 
03:36:07.590 --> 03:36:07.600 align:start position:0%
that sort of thing so
 
03:36:07.600 --> 03:36:09.269 align:start position:0%
that sort of thing so
um

03:36:09.269 --> 03:36:09.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:36:11.830 --> 03:36:11.840 align:start position:0%
so we would just urge uh this committee
 
03:36:14.229 --> 03:36:14.239 align:start position:0%
and and we're quite uh you know we're
 
03:36:15.910 --> 03:36:15.920 align:start position:0%
quite confident that
 
03:36:18.550 --> 03:36:18.560 align:start position:0%
lawmakers from both branches will
 
03:36:22.790 --> 03:36:22.800 align:start position:0%
collaborate to expeditiously reach a
 
03:36:24.550 --> 03:36:24.560 align:start position:0%
final bill
 
03:36:25.830 --> 03:36:25.840 align:start position:0%
if you need
 
03:36:29.110 --> 03:36:29.120 align:start position:0%
uh if you have any questions uh for any
 
03:36:31.830 --> 03:36:31.840 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire's dentists
 
03:36:33.830 --> 03:36:33.840 align:start position:0%
you know we are we're certainly always
 
03:36:35.670 --> 03:36:35.680 align:start position:0%
willing to work with
 
03:36:38.550 --> 03:36:38.560 align:start position:0%
this committee and all lawmakers in
 
03:36:38.560 --> 03:36:40.150 align:start position:0%
this committee and all lawmakers in
um

03:36:40.150 --> 03:36:40.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:36:42.469 --> 03:36:42.479 align:start position:0%
get finally getting this bill across uh
 
03:36:44.389 --> 03:36:44.399 align:start position:0%
the finish line and again we're very
 
03:36:46.389 --> 03:36:46.399 align:start position:0%
grateful for all the work you all have
 
03:36:48.229 --> 03:36:48.239 align:start position:0%
done in
 
03:36:51.750 --> 03:36:51.760 align:start position:0%
getting us to this impressive point
 
03:36:55.349 --> 03:36:55.359 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any questions at all
 
03:37:00.070 --> 03:37:00.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:02.710 --> 03:37:02.720 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
03:37:05.670 --> 03:37:05.680 align:start position:0%
i thought i remembered in 103 a talk
 
03:37:07.950 --> 03:37:07.960 align:start position:0%
about increasing people's personal
 
03:37:07.960 --> 03:37:09.510 align:start position:0%
about increasing people's personal
responsibility

03:37:09.510 --> 03:37:09.520 align:start position:0%
responsibility
 
03:37:11.190 --> 03:37:11.200 align:start position:0%
in dental care
 
03:37:13.190 --> 03:37:13.200 align:start position:0%
and i wonder if what you think about
 
03:37:16.630 --> 03:37:16.640 align:start position:0%
having a co-pay a small co-pay and then
 
03:37:18.309 --> 03:37:18.319 align:start position:0%
if they don't show up at the dentist
 
03:37:21.030 --> 03:37:21.040 align:start position:0%
office they owe the money anyway and
 
03:37:22.950 --> 03:37:22.960 align:start position:0%
won't get another appointment until they
 
03:37:26.070 --> 03:37:26.080 align:start position:0%
pay it well you you have identified a
 
03:37:28.830 --> 03:37:28.840 align:start position:0%
very significant issue with
 
03:37:33.110 --> 03:37:33.120 align:start position:0%
um you know with uh what what would
 
03:37:35.349 --> 03:37:35.359 align:start position:0%
ultimately face new hampshire's dentists
 
03:37:35.359 --> 03:37:36.870 align:start position:0%
ultimately face new hampshire's dentists
unlike

03:37:36.870 --> 03:37:36.880 align:start position:0%
unlike
 
03:37:38.870 --> 03:37:38.880 align:start position:0%
you know dentists are very much part of
 
03:37:41.510 --> 03:37:41.520 align:start position:0%
the healthcare landscape in in in our
 
03:37:43.750 --> 03:37:43.760 align:start position:0%
state you know the difference between
 
03:37:46.309 --> 03:37:46.319 align:start position:0%
a doctor and a dentist other than the
 
03:37:49.030 --> 03:37:49.040 align:start position:0%
work they do is many doctors are part of
 
03:37:51.030 --> 03:37:51.040 align:start position:0%
a hospital system if a patient doesn't
 
03:37:53.269 --> 03:37:53.279 align:start position:0%
show up there's always someone coming a
 
03:37:55.510 --> 03:37:55.520 align:start position:0%
dentist for the most part is a small
 
03:37:58.710 --> 03:37:58.720 align:start position:0%
business where a patient doesn't come in
 
03:38:00.469 --> 03:38:00.479 align:start position:0%
they are losing
 
03:38:02.389 --> 03:38:02.399 align:start position:0%
money as a business
 
03:38:02.399 --> 03:38:03.510 align:start position:0%
money as a business
um

03:38:03.510 --> 03:38:03.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:38:03.520 --> 03:38:04.229 align:start position:0%
um
and

03:38:04.229 --> 03:38:04.239 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:38:06.870 --> 03:38:06.880 align:start position:0%
so i would say that you know whether or
 
03:38:09.670 --> 03:38:09.680 align:start position:0%
not paying them back you know i'll leave
 
03:38:11.429 --> 03:38:11.439 align:start position:0%
that for
 
03:38:12.950 --> 03:38:12.960 align:start position:0%
for you all
 
03:38:12.960 --> 03:38:13.670 align:start position:0%
for you all
but

03:38:13.670 --> 03:38:13.680 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:38:15.510 --> 03:38:15.520 align:start position:0%
you've identified
 
03:38:20.550 --> 03:38:20.560 align:start position:0%
possibly even the most important problem
 
03:38:23.750 --> 03:38:23.760 align:start position:0%
that dentists would encounter
 
03:38:26.150 --> 03:38:26.160 align:start position:0%
and that's why we're encouraged by the
 
03:38:28.389 --> 03:38:28.399 align:start position:0%
care coordination aspect that's really
 
03:38:31.670 --> 03:38:31.680 align:start position:0%
been what we've been advocating for
 
03:38:31.680 --> 03:38:32.630 align:start position:0%
been what we've been advocating for
um

03:38:32.630 --> 03:38:32.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:38:35.030 --> 03:38:35.040 align:start position:0%
in the the working group that designed
 
03:38:35.040 --> 03:38:35.910 align:start position:0%
in the the working group that designed
um

03:38:35.910 --> 03:38:35.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:38:37.990 --> 03:38:38.000 align:start position:0%
you know the benefit before you
 
03:38:38.000 --> 03:38:39.030 align:start position:0%
you know the benefit before you
um

03:38:39.030 --> 03:38:39.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:38:41.670 --> 03:38:41.680 align:start position:0%
dentists you know it is it is definitely
 
03:38:43.910 --> 03:38:43.920 align:start position:0%
a concern that they don't want to have
 
03:38:46.469 --> 03:38:46.479 align:start position:0%
empty chairs they want patients in those
 
03:38:46.479 --> 03:38:47.670 align:start position:0%
empty chairs they want patients in those
chairs

03:38:47.670 --> 03:38:47.680 align:start position:0%
chairs
 
03:38:50.150 --> 03:38:50.160 align:start position:0%
and um you know we're we're confident in
 
03:38:52.150 --> 03:38:52.160 align:start position:0%
the bill before you now we you know
 
03:38:54.950 --> 03:38:54.960 align:start position:0%
we've worked very hard on it um you know
 
03:38:56.950 --> 03:38:56.960 align:start position:0%
with several of you we're we're happy
 
03:38:59.269 --> 03:38:59.279 align:start position:0%
with the work this committee did on the
 
03:39:01.750 --> 03:39:01.760 align:start position:0%
you know the house companion piece
 
03:39:04.389 --> 03:39:04.399 align:start position:0%
um in terms of the co-pay that you
 
03:39:04.399 --> 03:39:06.830 align:start position:0%
um in terms of the co-pay that you
identified

03:39:06.830 --> 03:39:06.840 align:start position:0%
identified
 
03:39:09.670 --> 03:39:09.680 align:start position:0%
um the dental society doesn't take a
 
03:39:09.680 --> 03:39:11.269 align:start position:0%
um the dental society doesn't take a
particular

03:39:11.269 --> 03:39:11.279 align:start position:0%
particular
 
03:39:15.429 --> 03:39:15.439 align:start position:0%
position on that issue we we understand
 
03:39:18.630 --> 03:39:18.640 align:start position:0%
the uh policy reasons for doing it
 
03:39:18.640 --> 03:39:19.670 align:start position:0%
the uh policy reasons for doing it
um

03:39:19.670 --> 03:39:19.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:39:22.710 --> 03:39:22.720 align:start position:0%
we think that simply the fact that there
 
03:39:25.030 --> 03:39:25.040 align:start position:0%
could be an adult benefit
 
03:39:27.510 --> 03:39:27.520 align:start position:0%
um will be reason enough for so many you
 
03:39:29.030 --> 03:39:29.040 align:start position:0%
know tens of thousands of people to
 
03:39:30.950 --> 03:39:30.960 align:start position:0%
finally get the oral health care they
 
03:39:30.960 --> 03:39:32.070 align:start position:0%
finally get the oral health care they
need

03:39:32.070 --> 03:39:32.080 align:start position:0%
need
 
03:39:32.080 --> 03:39:33.590 align:start position:0%
need
um

03:39:33.590 --> 03:39:33.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:39:35.990 --> 03:39:36.000 align:start position:0%
you know i know that they're from what
 
03:39:38.229 --> 03:39:38.239 align:start position:0%
i've heard there's been some discussion
 
03:39:40.710 --> 03:39:40.720 align:start position:0%
perhaps of removing the copay for
 
03:39:42.870 --> 03:39:42.880 align:start position:0%
preventative care
 
03:39:42.880 --> 03:39:43.830 align:start position:0%
preventative care
um

03:39:43.830 --> 03:39:43.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:39:45.750 --> 03:39:45.760 align:start position:0%
that i think would
 
03:39:47.349 --> 03:39:47.359 align:start position:0%
you know i think the preventative care
 
03:39:49.510 --> 03:39:49.520 align:start position:0%
is just so important getting people in
 
03:39:51.269 --> 03:39:51.279 align:start position:0%
the door to get their mouths treated
 
03:39:52.870 --> 03:39:52.880 align:start position:0%
make sure they don't get cavities that
 
03:39:56.150 --> 03:39:56.160 align:start position:0%
sort of thing oral health disease
 
03:39:58.790 --> 03:39:58.800 align:start position:0%
i think that would be a
 
03:40:00.790 --> 03:40:00.800 align:start position:0%
beneficial change to make perhaps
 
03:40:03.030 --> 03:40:03.040 align:start position:0%
leaving a co-pay for you know the
 
03:40:05.189 --> 03:40:05.199 align:start position:0%
remaining procedures but to get people
 
03:40:06.870 --> 03:40:06.880 align:start position:0%
in the door for their checkups for the
 
03:40:09.670 --> 03:40:09.680 align:start position:0%
preventative care perhaps not having it
 
03:40:10.790 --> 03:40:10.800 align:start position:0%
for that
 
03:40:13.750 --> 03:40:13.760 align:start position:0%
we could see that as a as um
 
03:40:15.429 --> 03:40:15.439 align:start position:0%
as something you could do to him to
 
03:40:17.269 --> 03:40:17.279 align:start position:0%
improve the bill while still leaving the
 
03:40:20.389 --> 03:40:20.399 align:start position:0%
co-pay perhaps for
 
03:40:23.830 --> 03:40:23.840 align:start position:0%
other procedures uh representative
 
03:40:25.670 --> 03:40:25.680 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:40:25.680 --> 03:40:28.790 align:start position:0%
thank you
absolutely

03:40:28.790 --> 03:40:28.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:31.030 --> 03:40:31.040 align:start position:0%
other representative bears
 
03:40:32.790 --> 03:40:32.800 align:start position:0%
okay thank you madam chairman uh
 
03:40:34.469 --> 03:40:34.479 align:start position:0%
representative weiler asked the question
 
03:40:36.950 --> 03:40:36.960 align:start position:0%
that i was very interested in asking
 
03:40:39.910 --> 03:40:39.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:43.990 --> 03:40:44.000 align:start position:0%
