had this on my schedule it's next
tuesday

00:14:05.350 --> 00:14:05.360 align:start position:0%
tuesday
 
00:14:07.030 --> 00:14:07.040 align:start position:0%
for the record my uh my name is
 
00:14:09.269 --> 00:14:09.279 align:start position:0%
representative howard pearl from loudoun
 
00:14:12.629 --> 00:14:12.639 align:start position:0%
and i represent uh merrimack 26.
 
00:14:15.509 --> 00:14:15.519 align:start position:0%
i introduced uh house bill 116 i
 
00:14:17.990 --> 00:14:18.000 align:start position:0%
submitted house bill 1164 on at the
 
00:14:20.470 --> 00:14:20.480 align:start position:0%
request of the department of agriculture
 
00:14:23.350 --> 00:14:23.360 align:start position:0%
commissioner commissioner jasper he had
 
00:14:25.509 --> 00:14:25.519 align:start position:0%
some concerns with the
 
00:14:27.829 --> 00:14:27.839 align:start position:0%
language as it was written and he wanted
 
00:14:29.590 --> 00:14:29.600 align:start position:0%
to make some changes
 
00:14:31.750 --> 00:14:31.760 align:start position:0%
so he provided this language for me and
 
00:14:34.389 --> 00:14:34.399 align:start position:0%
with his assistance in the ag's office
 
00:14:36.790 --> 00:14:36.800 align:start position:0%
this is the language that we had i was
 
00:14:38.230 --> 00:14:38.240 align:start position:0%
hopeful he was going to be here to
 
00:14:40.069 --> 00:14:40.079 align:start position:0%
really describe it because i'm not
 
00:14:42.069 --> 00:14:42.079 align:start position:0%
necessarily prepared to do that but i
 
00:14:44.230 --> 00:14:44.240 align:start position:0%
wanted to introduce and offer it to him
 
00:14:46.790 --> 00:14:46.800 align:start position:0%
to describe
 
00:14:47.750 --> 00:14:47.760 align:start position:0%
so i
 
00:14:50.230 --> 00:14:50.240 align:start position:0%
do not know i don't see any members from
 
00:14:53.030 --> 00:14:53.040 align:start position:0%
the department here
 
00:14:54.629 --> 00:14:54.639 align:start position:0%
i won't do a good job describing it
 
00:14:56.150 --> 00:14:56.160 align:start position:0%
honestly because i was really prepared
 
00:14:59.269 --> 00:14:59.279 align:start position:0%
for him to do it so
 
00:15:01.110 --> 00:15:01.120 align:start position:0%
but i can tell you that
 
00:15:02.870 --> 00:15:02.880 align:start position:0%
there's no substantial changes but it
 
00:15:05.509 --> 00:15:05.519 align:start position:0%
does fix some areas where there were
 
00:15:08.389 --> 00:15:08.399 align:start position:0%
basically two different um sections in
 
00:15:10.710 --> 00:15:10.720 align:start position:0%
in large that it was
 
00:15:12.710 --> 00:15:12.720 align:start position:0%
we had like competing um
 
00:15:14.230 --> 00:15:14.240 align:start position:0%
committees that were occurring and they
 
00:15:15.430 --> 00:15:15.440 align:start position:0%
really needed to be appointed by the
 
00:15:16.550 --> 00:15:16.560 align:start position:0%
governor so
 
00:15:17.910 --> 00:15:17.920 align:start position:0%
rather than the way they had been
 
00:15:19.590 --> 00:15:19.600 align:start position:0%
previously appointed so this kind of
 
00:15:22.629 --> 00:15:22.639 align:start position:0%
cleans that up and and gets the language
 
00:15:24.790 --> 00:15:24.800 align:start position:0%
to where it needs to be to work properly
 
00:15:26.230 --> 00:15:26.240 align:start position:0%
i do know that i've spoken with some
 
00:15:27.990 --> 00:15:28.000 align:start position:0%
members of the
 
00:15:29.509 --> 00:15:29.519 align:start position:0%
committee currently and they are in
 
00:15:31.749 --> 00:15:31.759 align:start position:0%
agreement with the language of the ag in
 
00:15:33.590 --> 00:15:33.600 align:start position:0%
the classroom committee so
 
00:15:35.350 --> 00:15:35.360 align:start position:0%
with that i don't have a lot more to add
 
00:15:37.430 --> 00:15:37.440 align:start position:0%
in my apologies again for being late i
 
00:15:38.949 --> 00:15:38.959 align:start position:0%
really don't know why i had this on next
 
00:15:40.389 --> 00:15:40.399 align:start position:0%
tuesday and i must have entered it
 
00:15:43.269 --> 00:15:43.279 align:start position:0%
improperly in my calendar
 
00:15:47.110 --> 00:15:47.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:48.389 --> 00:15:48.399 align:start position:0%
maybe not uncommon but a little
 
00:15:50.790 --> 00:15:50.800 align:start position:0%
embarrassing so my apologies well that's
 
00:15:53.110 --> 00:15:53.120 align:start position:0%
fine are there any questions from
 
00:15:54.710 --> 00:15:54.720 align:start position:0%
committee members here represent
 
00:15:58.470 --> 00:15:58.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:00.069 --> 00:16:00.079 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and uh thank you
 
00:16:01.590 --> 00:16:01.600 align:start position:0%
representative pearl
 
00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:02.790 align:start position:0%
representative pearl
um

00:16:02.790 --> 00:16:02.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:04.069 align:start position:0%
um
it

00:16:04.069 --> 00:16:04.079 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:16:06.230 --> 00:16:06.240 align:start position:0%
it seems as though there are no
 
00:16:09.350 --> 00:16:09.360 align:start position:0%
legislators in the current statute or in
 
00:16:09.360 --> 00:16:10.629 align:start position:0%
legislators in the current statute or in
this

00:16:10.629 --> 00:16:10.639 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:16:10.639 --> 00:16:14.150 align:start position:0%
this
revised

00:16:14.150 --> 00:16:14.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:15.990 --> 00:16:16.000 align:start position:0%
classroom committee agriculture in the
 
00:16:18.150 --> 00:16:18.160 align:start position:0%
classroom committee
 
00:16:20.150 --> 00:16:20.160 align:start position:0%
i'm just wondering do you think that
 
00:16:21.829 --> 00:16:21.839 align:start position:0%
there should be
 
00:16:24.150 --> 00:16:24.160 align:start position:0%
some representatives of the legislature
 
00:16:25.829 --> 00:16:25.839 align:start position:0%
on the committee
 
00:16:27.749 --> 00:16:27.759 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question so i guess i
 
00:16:30.230 --> 00:16:30.240 align:start position:0%
would say representative that uh
 
00:16:32.470 --> 00:16:32.480 align:start position:0%
again this this language was drafted by
 
00:16:35.269 --> 00:16:35.279 align:start position:0%
the commissioner himself and with the
 
00:16:37.269 --> 00:16:37.279 align:start position:0%
approval of the ag and with the approval
 
00:16:38.710 --> 00:16:38.720 align:start position:0%
of the current ag in the classroom
 
00:16:40.310 --> 00:16:40.320 align:start position:0%
committee and
 
00:16:42.069 --> 00:16:42.079 align:start position:0%
i guess since we've not had any there
 
00:16:43.509 --> 00:16:43.519 align:start position:0%
and we really aren't having any issues
 
00:16:45.110 --> 00:16:45.120 align:start position:0%
this you know that i don't know that it
 
00:16:47.110 --> 00:16:47.120 align:start position:0%
would be necessary but certainly if your
 
00:16:49.829 --> 00:16:49.839 align:start position:0%
committee wishes to add some i guess my
 
00:16:51.749 --> 00:16:51.759 align:start position:0%
recommendation would be to have that
 
00:16:53.749 --> 00:16:53.759 align:start position:0%
conversation with commissioner jasper
 
00:16:55.110 --> 00:16:55.120 align:start position:0%
and make sure that he would be okay with
 
00:16:57.189 --> 00:16:57.199 align:start position:0%
it thank you you're welcome further
 
00:17:00.389 --> 00:17:00.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:02.150 --> 00:17:02.160 align:start position:0%
yeah since you're not
 
00:17:04.789 --> 00:17:04.799 align:start position:0%
um jasper i'm not sure you can actually
 
00:17:07.669 --> 00:17:07.679 align:start position:0%
answer this but i'll ask in case you can
 
00:17:09.829 --> 00:17:09.839 align:start position:0%
i just wondered what happened to the new
 
00:17:12.230 --> 00:17:12.240 align:start position:0%
hampshire fruit growers association and
 
00:17:13.829 --> 00:17:13.839 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire farmers market
 
00:17:15.750 --> 00:17:15.760 align:start position:0%
association because they were in the
 
00:17:17.350 --> 00:17:17.360 align:start position:0%
other one and they're not in this one
 
00:17:20.309 --> 00:17:20.319 align:start position:0%
sure again thank you for the question uh
 
00:17:22.069 --> 00:17:22.079 align:start position:0%
that was some of the things that needed
 
00:17:24.549 --> 00:17:24.559 align:start position:0%
to be cleaned up because by statute my
 
00:17:26.230 --> 00:17:26.240 align:start position:0%
understanding is these positions needed
 
00:17:28.549 --> 00:17:28.559 align:start position:0%
to be appointed by the governor and it
 
00:17:30.549 --> 00:17:30.559 align:start position:0%
was we sort of had a secondary board
 
00:17:32.150 --> 00:17:32.160 align:start position:0%
that was just a collection of people
 
00:17:34.390 --> 00:17:34.400 align:start position:0%
that were were there and doing the job
 
00:17:36.230 --> 00:17:36.240 align:start position:0%
and not that it was going badly but the
 
00:17:37.990 --> 00:17:38.000 align:start position:0%
commissioner is trying to clean it up
 
00:17:39.430 --> 00:17:39.440 align:start position:0%
and get it so that it complies with the
 
00:17:39.440 --> 00:17:40.870 align:start position:0%
and get it so that it complies with the
statute

00:17:40.870 --> 00:17:40.880 align:start position:0%
statute
 
00:17:43.029 --> 00:17:43.039 align:start position:0%

00:17:46.870 --> 00:17:46.880 align:start position:0%
have a brief question thank you mr chair
 
00:17:48.150 --> 00:17:48.160 align:start position:0%
and thank you pearl for taking my
 
00:17:49.830 --> 00:17:49.840 align:start position:0%
question did you say that this was an
 
00:17:52.390 --> 00:17:52.400 align:start position:0%
existing committee already
 
00:17:54.950 --> 00:17:54.960 align:start position:0%
okay yes thank you thank you yes there
 
00:17:57.350 --> 00:17:57.360 align:start position:0%
was a committee and again there was
 
00:17:58.789 --> 00:17:58.799 align:start position:0%
it was just some conflict in the way
 
00:18:00.310 --> 00:18:00.320 align:start position:0%
that it had been done and the
 
00:18:02.070 --> 00:18:02.080 align:start position:0%
commissioner is trying to get it so that
 
00:18:03.669 --> 00:18:03.679 align:start position:0%
it is established
 
00:18:05.510 --> 00:18:05.520 align:start position:0%
correctly according to the statute
 
00:18:06.870 --> 00:18:06.880 align:start position:0%
representative mullen
 
00:18:08.470 --> 00:18:08.480 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you
 
00:18:10.549 --> 00:18:10.559 align:start position:0%
representative i'm over here behind the
 
00:18:13.110 --> 00:18:13.120 align:start position:0%
speaker i'm sorry i know it's okay i
 
00:18:14.870 --> 00:18:14.880 align:start position:0%
can't see you either
 
00:18:18.390 --> 00:18:18.400 align:start position:0%
uh at roman two line eight the committee
 
00:18:21.590 --> 00:18:21.600 align:start position:0%
shall be a not-for-profit voluntary
 
00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:23.510 align:start position:0%
shall be a not-for-profit voluntary
corporation

00:18:23.510 --> 00:18:23.520 align:start position:0%
corporation
 
00:18:26.830 --> 00:18:26.840 align:start position:0%
and shall possess all general powers of
 
00:18:29.590 --> 00:18:29.600 align:start position:0%
uh why um
 
00:18:32.630 --> 00:18:32.640 align:start position:0%
why was there a change having it moved
 
00:18:34.470 --> 00:18:34.480 align:start position:0%
from just a
 
00:18:36.549 --> 00:18:36.559 align:start position:0%
run-of-the-mill committee if you will to
 
00:18:39.750 --> 00:18:39.760 align:start position:0%
a non-for pro not-for-profit corporation
 
00:18:41.350 --> 00:18:41.360 align:start position:0%
thank you that's a great question i'm
 
00:18:43.190 --> 00:18:43.200 align:start position:0%
going to really ask you to direct that
 
00:18:44.789 --> 00:18:44.799 align:start position:0%
more to the commissioner when you have
 
00:18:46.630 --> 00:18:46.640 align:start position:0%
an opportunity to speak with him but my
 
00:18:49.110 --> 00:18:49.120 align:start position:0%
understanding is that they received some
 
00:18:50.470 --> 00:18:50.480 align:start position:0%
funding and they wanted to make sure
 
00:18:51.830 --> 00:18:51.840 align:start position:0%
that they were following having the
 
00:18:53.909 --> 00:18:53.919 align:start position:0%
proper protocols in place so that they
 
00:18:55.909 --> 00:18:55.919 align:start position:0%
as a not-for-profit they would have that
 
00:18:57.270 --> 00:18:57.280 align:start position:0%
where they wouldn't have the oversight
 
00:18:59.350 --> 00:18:59.360 align:start position:0%
previously that was my understanding but
 
00:19:01.190 --> 00:19:01.200 align:start position:0%
i would again defer to the commissioner
 
00:19:03.350 --> 00:19:03.360 align:start position:0%
really to answer that question properly
 
00:19:05.270 --> 00:19:05.280 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you representative do
 
00:19:08.070 --> 00:19:08.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:11.510 --> 00:19:11.520 align:start position:0%
representative tanner thank you
 
00:19:14.070 --> 00:19:14.080 align:start position:0%
um i was wondering why this bill came to
 
00:19:17.270 --> 00:19:17.280 align:start position:0%
education and not agriculture
 
00:19:19.110 --> 00:19:19.120 align:start position:0%
i that is a great question and i guess
 
00:19:21.510 --> 00:19:21.520 align:start position:0%
that was the purview of this the speaker
 
00:19:23.110 --> 00:19:23.120 align:start position:0%
made that choice and i did not have a
 
00:19:24.710 --> 00:19:24.720 align:start position:0%
discussion with him so i'd have to defer
 
00:19:26.310 --> 00:19:26.320 align:start position:0%
that question to him is that why that
 
00:19:28.950 --> 00:19:28.960 align:start position:0%
choice was made
 
00:19:30.710 --> 00:19:30.720 align:start position:0%
thank you yeah we could have vacated it
 
00:19:33.350 --> 00:19:33.360 align:start position:0%
to you you could have um
 
00:19:35.510 --> 00:19:35.520 align:start position:0%
so i i i want to just follow up on the
 
00:19:37.350 --> 00:19:37.360 align:start position:0%
track that representative cordelli was
 
00:19:39.990 --> 00:19:40.000 align:start position:0%
on i've worked with the farm bureau you
 
00:19:41.830 --> 00:19:41.840 align:start position:0%
have a bill that's coming up that's ours
 
00:19:41.840 --> 00:19:43.430 align:start position:0%
have a bill that's coming up that's ours
on

00:19:43.430 --> 00:19:43.440 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:19:46.230 --> 00:19:46.240 align:start position:0%
next week dealing with the uh
 
00:19:48.470 --> 00:19:48.480 align:start position:0%
fairs in the state and capital support
 
00:19:50.549 --> 00:19:50.559 align:start position:0%
to them um
 
00:19:52.950 --> 00:19:52.960 align:start position:0%
so and i and and putting that together
 
00:19:54.630 --> 00:19:54.640 align:start position:0%
i've worked very closely with the farm
 
00:19:57.590 --> 00:19:57.600 align:start position:0%
bureau and the fair associations etc
 
00:19:59.750 --> 00:19:59.760 align:start position:0%
that are dealing with agriculture
 
00:20:03.990 --> 00:20:04.000 align:start position:0%
and and and marketing of uh farm produce
 
00:20:05.270 --> 00:20:05.280 align:start position:0%
um so
 
00:20:08.710 --> 00:20:08.720 align:start position:0%
so do you would you support i i i heard
 
00:20:10.870 --> 00:20:10.880 align:start position:0%
you speak about to represent courtney
 
00:20:14.310 --> 00:20:14.320 align:start position:0%
but would you support our putting a
 
00:20:17.029 --> 00:20:17.039 align:start position:0%
a legislator on there so that this is
 
00:20:19.190 --> 00:20:19.200 align:start position:0%
the first time i've ever heard of this
 
00:20:21.110 --> 00:20:21.120 align:start position:0%
committee uh
 
00:20:23.430 --> 00:20:23.440 align:start position:0%
and other than seeing it in the bill
 
00:20:25.990 --> 00:20:26.000 align:start position:0%
so that we can have some input and
 
00:20:27.510 --> 00:20:27.520 align:start position:0%
communicate what's going on with the
 
00:20:29.110 --> 00:20:29.120 align:start position:0%
legislature i know the farm bureau is
 
00:20:32.549 --> 00:20:32.559 align:start position:0%
very interested and i they work with you
 
00:20:34.390 --> 00:20:34.400 align:start position:0%
but on this particular aspect of
 
00:20:36.070 --> 00:20:36.080 align:start position:0%
education well thank you for the
 
00:20:38.070 --> 00:20:38.080 align:start position:0%
question i would not oppose it as long
 
00:20:39.430 --> 00:20:39.440 align:start position:0%
as it wasn't me
 
00:20:39.440 --> 00:20:41.590 align:start position:0%
as it wasn't me
[Laughter]

00:20:41.590 --> 00:20:41.600 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
00:20:43.510 --> 00:20:43.520 align:start position:0%
i'm just kidding i i got you
 
00:20:45.750 --> 00:20:45.760 align:start position:0%
no i would not oppose it i think if that
 
00:20:47.110 --> 00:20:47.120 align:start position:0%
is the will of the committee again i
 
00:20:48.630 --> 00:20:48.640 align:start position:0%
would encourage that a conversation is
 
00:20:50.789 --> 00:20:50.799 align:start position:0%
had with the commissioner so that he's
 
00:20:52.630 --> 00:20:52.640 align:start position:0%
um up to speed and
 
00:20:53.990 --> 00:20:54.000 align:start position:0%
you know and and he may have some
 
00:20:55.430 --> 00:20:55.440 align:start position:0%
objections that i'm not aware of but
 
00:20:57.190 --> 00:20:57.200 align:start position:0%
personally i would not have any
 
00:20:59.430 --> 00:20:59.440 align:start position:0%
objection to thank you and represent you
 
00:21:01.990 --> 00:21:02.000 align:start position:0%
got a hand up again i do thank you i
 
00:21:03.590 --> 00:21:03.600 align:start position:0%
should have followed up
 
00:21:05.990 --> 00:21:06.000 align:start position:0%
my first time around mr chair uh
 
00:21:07.830 --> 00:21:07.840 align:start position:0%
representative uh
 
00:21:10.789 --> 00:21:10.799 align:start position:0%
further down in roman numeral two
 
00:21:13.270 --> 00:21:13.280 align:start position:0%
one of those duties and powers is to
 
00:21:15.510 --> 00:21:15.520 align:start position:0%
hire and and
 
00:21:18.230 --> 00:21:18.240 align:start position:0%
oversee an education director for the
 
00:21:18.240 --> 00:21:19.430 align:start position:0%
oversee an education director for the
program

00:21:19.430 --> 00:21:19.440 align:start position:0%
program
 
00:21:22.789 --> 00:21:22.799 align:start position:0%
um my question is twofold one is there
 
00:21:25.190 --> 00:21:25.200 align:start position:0%
currently a director and two in the
 
00:21:27.590 --> 00:21:27.600 align:start position:0%
absence of a director because i see that
 
00:21:27.600 --> 00:21:28.310 align:start position:0%
absence of a director because i see that
it

00:21:28.310 --> 00:21:28.320 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:21:31.029 --> 00:21:31.039 align:start position:0%
is finance dependent and i don't see a
 
00:21:33.350 --> 00:21:33.360 align:start position:0%
financial note on the bill
 
00:21:35.909 --> 00:21:35.919 align:start position:0%
so i'm just wondering in the absence of
 
00:21:38.789 --> 00:21:38.799 align:start position:0%
hiring a director who would in fact be
 
00:21:40.870 --> 00:21:40.880 align:start position:0%
administering this sure thank you for
 
00:21:42.549 --> 00:21:42.559 align:start position:0%
the question i can tell you the first
 
00:21:44.390 --> 00:21:44.400 align:start position:0%
part i can answer with
 
00:21:46.789 --> 00:21:46.799 align:start position:0%
certainty yes there is a director now
 
00:21:49.750 --> 00:21:49.760 align:start position:0%
it's a part-time position if i remember
 
00:21:52.549 --> 00:21:52.559 align:start position:0%
correctly i've worked some with with deb
 
00:21:54.549 --> 00:21:54.559 align:start position:0%
on this um
 
00:21:56.310 --> 00:21:56.320 align:start position:0%
i guess in the absence of funding i'm
 
00:21:58.710 --> 00:21:58.720 align:start position:0%
not sure exactly how it would go it
 
00:22:00.390 --> 00:22:00.400 align:start position:0%
hasn't been a problem because there has
 
00:22:01.510 --> 00:22:01.520 align:start position:0%
been there's there's a couple of
 
00:22:03.029 --> 00:22:03.039 align:start position:0%
different funding sources and again i
 
00:22:04.710 --> 00:22:04.720 align:start position:0%
really wish the commissioner was here to
 
00:22:06.470 --> 00:22:06.480 align:start position:0%
speak to it he's much more knowledgeable
 
00:22:08.549 --> 00:22:08.559 align:start position:0%
on this topic than i am but i do know
 
00:22:10.230 --> 00:22:10.240 align:start position:0%
there's donations made from new
 
00:22:12.390 --> 00:22:12.400 align:start position:0%
hampshire farm bureau and i believe
 
00:22:14.070 --> 00:22:14.080 align:start position:0%
there's there's another source as well
 
00:22:15.669 --> 00:22:15.679 align:start position:0%
but again i don't want to speak to
 
00:22:17.029 --> 00:22:17.039 align:start position:0%
something that i'm not certain of but i
 
00:22:18.870 --> 00:22:18.880 align:start position:0%
do know there's a secondary source that
 
00:22:20.470 --> 00:22:20.480 align:start position:0%
seems to provide steady enough funding
 
00:22:23.750 --> 00:22:23.760 align:start position:0%
to keep a director in place
 
00:22:25.510 --> 00:22:25.520 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
00:22:27.029 --> 00:22:27.039 align:start position:0%

00:23:27.510 --> 00:23:27.520 align:start position:0%
statute that it established it and i
 
00:23:29.029 --> 00:23:29.039 align:start position:0%
guess i don't know going back to the
 
00:23:31.190 --> 00:23:31.200 align:start position:0%
roots why it was started that way
 
00:23:32.950 --> 00:23:32.960 align:start position:0%
but that's the way it has been and this
 
00:23:34.789 --> 00:23:34.799 align:start position:0%
just kind of cleaned up some concerns
 
00:23:36.390 --> 00:23:36.400 align:start position:0%
that the the commissioner had with the
 
00:23:38.549 --> 00:23:38.559 align:start position:0%
way that uh things had been operating he
 
00:23:40.470 --> 00:23:40.480 align:start position:0%
was trying to make it to comply more
 
00:23:42.549 --> 00:23:42.559 align:start position:0%
with the will of the legislature in the
 
00:23:44.470 --> 00:23:44.480 align:start position:0%
in the current statute
 
00:23:46.549 --> 00:23:46.559 align:start position:0%
so again i i would encourage perhaps you
 
00:23:48.230 --> 00:23:48.240 align:start position:0%
could have the commissioner come in for
 
00:23:49.350 --> 00:23:49.360 align:start position:0%
another time
 
00:23:51.430 --> 00:23:51.440 align:start position:0%
and and speak more in depth and i
 
00:23:53.750 --> 00:23:53.760 align:start position:0%
apologize i i don't like not giving you
 
00:23:55.750 --> 00:23:55.760 align:start position:0%
complete and in full answers but i'm
 
00:23:57.029 --> 00:23:57.039 align:start position:0%
certainly sharing you to the best of the
 
00:23:59.750 --> 00:23:59.760 align:start position:0%
knowledge that i have
 
00:24:00.870 --> 00:24:00.880 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:24:02.230 --> 00:24:02.240 align:start position:0%
representative woodcock thank you
 
00:24:03.830 --> 00:24:03.840 align:start position:0%
everyone away it was a real good morning
 
00:24:05.669 --> 00:24:05.679 align:start position:0%
thank you good morning i was following
 
00:24:07.029 --> 00:24:07.039 align:start position:0%
trying to find the bill and the
 
00:24:07.039 --> 00:24:08.149 align:start position:0%
trying to find the bill and the
education

00:24:08.149 --> 00:24:08.159 align:start position:0%
education
 
00:24:08.159 --> 00:24:09.029 align:start position:0%
education
uh

00:24:09.029 --> 00:24:09.039 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:24:10.310 --> 00:24:10.320 align:start position:0%
laws for research which i couldn't
 
00:24:13.029 --> 00:24:13.039 align:start position:0%
obviously they weren't there um but they
 
00:24:16.230 --> 00:24:16.240 align:start position:0%
are on this little magnificent computer
 
00:24:18.950 --> 00:24:18.960 align:start position:0%
and it was 2009 when it first started
 
00:24:20.870 --> 00:24:20.880 align:start position:0%
but i'm looking at the bill as presented
 
00:24:20.880 --> 00:24:21.750 align:start position:0%
but i'm looking at the bill as presented
here

00:24:21.750 --> 00:24:21.760 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:24:24.230 --> 00:24:24.240 align:start position:0%
and i'm thinking about what what is
 
00:24:27.750 --> 00:24:27.760 align:start position:0%
someone may say uh one of our leaders
 
00:24:29.430 --> 00:24:29.440 align:start position:0%
what is the intent of this i'm looking
 
00:24:31.590 --> 00:24:31.600 align:start position:0%
at line five and six
 
00:24:34.310 --> 00:24:34.320 align:start position:0%
uh where it says that the k-12 students
 
00:24:35.190 --> 00:24:35.200 align:start position:0%
throughout the state using
 
00:24:37.590 --> 00:24:37.600 align:start position:0%
interdisciplinary education i understand
 
00:24:39.510 --> 00:24:39.520 align:start position:0%
by reading the old bill 2009 where the
 
00:24:41.510 --> 00:24:41.520 align:start position:0%
committee people the different
 
00:24:43.110 --> 00:24:43.120 align:start position:0%
organizations are restructuring the
 
00:24:44.630 --> 00:24:44.640 align:start position:0%
affiliate i get that
 
00:24:45.750 --> 00:24:45.760 align:start position:0%
and everyone else is pretty much the
 
00:24:48.630 --> 00:24:48.640 align:start position:0%
same but where where is this going
 
00:24:50.950 --> 00:24:50.960 align:start position:0%
where is this statewide k-12
 
00:24:53.350 --> 00:24:53.360 align:start position:0%
interdisciplinary education going
 
00:24:55.110 --> 00:24:55.120 align:start position:0%
because that's not in the original 2009
 
00:24:57.029 --> 00:24:57.039 align:start position:0%
bill as i read it
 
00:24:58.390 --> 00:24:58.400 align:start position:0%
well thank you for the question though
 
00:25:00.470 --> 00:25:00.480 align:start position:0%
i'm not quite sure i'm clear on what
 
00:25:02.230 --> 00:25:02.240 align:start position:0%
you're looking for where is it going
 
00:25:05.029 --> 00:25:05.039 align:start position:0%
mean what is the future of the program
 
00:25:06.710 --> 00:25:06.720 align:start position:0%
when it says throughout k-12 throughout
 
00:25:08.549 --> 00:25:08.559 align:start position:0%
the state is this going to be a new
 
00:25:08.559 --> 00:25:09.830 align:start position:0%
the state is this going to be a new
program

00:25:09.830 --> 00:25:09.840 align:start position:0%
program
 
00:25:11.990 --> 00:25:12.000 align:start position:0%
uh put in because it's not listed as
 
00:25:14.549 --> 00:25:14.559 align:start position:0%
such in the old bills let's say creating
 
00:25:16.950 --> 00:25:16.960 align:start position:0%
curriculum and stuff but um where is
 
00:25:18.310 --> 00:25:18.320 align:start position:0%
this going with was now is in the
 
00:25:20.630 --> 00:25:20.640 align:start position:0%
mission to do that sure okay i think i
 
00:25:22.070 --> 00:25:22.080 align:start position:0%
have a little bit of thank you my
 
00:25:23.430 --> 00:25:23.440 align:start position:0%
understanding is this to continue the
 
00:25:25.510 --> 00:25:25.520 align:start position:0%
same program that's been going on
 
00:25:28.390 --> 00:25:28.400 align:start position:0%
ongoing for many years and i'm not aware
 
00:25:30.230 --> 00:25:30.240 align:start position:0%
that there's any move to make any
 
00:25:31.590 --> 00:25:31.600 align:start position:0%
changes from what it's currently been
 
00:25:31.600 --> 00:25:32.470 align:start position:0%
changes from what it's currently been
doing

00:25:32.470 --> 00:25:32.480 align:start position:0%
doing
 
00:25:34.710 --> 00:25:34.720 align:start position:0%
it provides a lot of good education and
 
00:25:36.630 --> 00:25:36.640 align:start position:0%
a little bit of
 
00:25:38.870 --> 00:25:38.880 align:start position:0%
funding and expertise to sometimes to
 
00:25:40.710 --> 00:25:40.720 align:start position:0%
school teachers to do you know might be
 
00:25:43.590 --> 00:25:43.600 align:start position:0%
a maple syrup program or it might be a
 
00:25:45.110 --> 00:25:45.120 align:start position:0%
you know a seed growing program or
 
00:25:46.870 --> 00:25:46.880 align:start position:0%
something like that to sort of introduce
 
00:25:49.269 --> 00:25:49.279 align:start position:0%
the kids to agriculture and
 
00:25:50.549 --> 00:25:50.559 align:start position:0%
allow them to
 
00:25:51.590 --> 00:25:51.600 align:start position:0%
kind of have fun with it and see the
 
00:25:53.190 --> 00:25:53.200 align:start position:0%
benefits of it within their own life you
 
00:25:54.390 --> 00:25:54.400 align:start position:0%
know we might inspire them to go home
 
00:25:55.990 --> 00:25:56.000 align:start position:0%
and have their family grow a garden or
 
00:25:57.990 --> 00:25:58.000 align:start position:0%
something along that line so that's the
 
00:25:59.590 --> 00:25:59.600 align:start position:0%
current program and my understanding is
 
00:26:02.549 --> 00:26:02.559 align:start position:0%
that's what it's intended to state
 
00:26:04.310 --> 00:26:04.320 align:start position:0%
thank you follow up thank you so you
 
00:26:05.909 --> 00:26:05.919 align:start position:0%
don't see this right you'll see this as
 
00:26:08.149 --> 00:26:08.159 align:start position:0%
the intent to create more legislation
 
00:26:10.390 --> 00:26:10.400 align:start position:0%
and add into the curriculum k to 12. i
 
00:26:11.590 --> 00:26:11.600 align:start position:0%
do not okay thank you very much
 
00:26:13.590 --> 00:26:13.600 align:start position:0%
president pearl thank you represent like
 
00:26:13.600 --> 00:26:15.669 align:start position:0%
president pearl thank you represent like
us

00:26:15.669 --> 00:26:15.679 align:start position:0%
us
 
00:26:17.909 --> 00:26:17.919 align:start position:0%
i'm just curious
 
00:26:19.750 --> 00:26:19.760 align:start position:0%
seeing this which i didn't know existed
 
00:26:21.190 --> 00:26:21.200 align:start position:0%
i think it's cool
 
00:26:24.710 --> 00:26:24.720 align:start position:0%
um do you know if any schools do field
 
00:26:27.669 --> 00:26:27.679 align:start position:0%
trips to particular agricultural things
 
00:26:29.669 --> 00:26:29.679 align:start position:0%
i remember when i was a kid
 
00:26:31.510 --> 00:26:31.520 align:start position:0%
every year in elementary school we went
 
00:26:33.110 --> 00:26:33.120 align:start position:0%
to the local dairy
 
00:26:35.269 --> 00:26:35.279 align:start position:0%
and saw how it worked i'm you know and
 
00:26:37.269 --> 00:26:37.279 align:start position:0%
that made me think of that and i just
 
00:26:39.669 --> 00:26:39.679 align:start position:0%
wondered if you knew if that happens now
 
00:26:41.510 --> 00:26:41.520 align:start position:0%
sure thank you for the question
 
00:26:44.230 --> 00:26:44.240 align:start position:0%
i'm not certain that they do necessarily
 
00:26:46.310 --> 00:26:46.320 align:start position:0%
related to this program
 
00:26:47.830 --> 00:26:47.840 align:start position:0%
i certainly know the schools have come
 
00:26:49.750 --> 00:26:49.760 align:start position:0%
to my own farm for maple tours and
 
00:26:51.110 --> 00:26:51.120 align:start position:0%
things of that nature and back when i
 
00:26:53.110 --> 00:26:53.120 align:start position:0%
dairy farm they did as well again i
 
00:26:54.470 --> 00:26:54.480 align:start position:0%
don't know that it was associated
 
00:26:56.630 --> 00:26:56.640 align:start position:0%
specifically to the ag in the classroom
 
00:26:56.640 --> 00:26:57.669 align:start position:0%
specifically to the ag in the classroom
program

00:26:57.669 --> 00:26:57.679 align:start position:0%
program
 
00:26:59.590 --> 00:26:59.600 align:start position:0%
to my knowledge they don't set up tours
 
00:27:01.590 --> 00:27:01.600 align:start position:0%
themselves but they certainly do work
 
00:27:04.230 --> 00:27:04.240 align:start position:0%
with the producers excuse me the
 
00:27:05.510 --> 00:27:05.520 align:start position:0%
teachers to
 
00:27:07.750 --> 00:27:07.760 align:start position:0%
help them and aid them in some expertise
 
00:27:09.269 --> 00:27:09.279 align:start position:0%
and things that they need to do the
 
00:27:11.590 --> 00:27:11.600 align:start position:0%
various programs that are offered again
 
00:27:13.430 --> 00:27:13.440 align:start position:0%
i'm most familiar with the maple syrup
 
00:27:15.430 --> 00:27:15.440 align:start position:0%
program because of my own
 
00:27:18.070 --> 00:27:18.080 align:start position:0%
participation within that industry but
 
00:27:19.669 --> 00:27:19.679 align:start position:0%
it's a great program and i've judged the
 
00:27:21.750 --> 00:27:21.760 align:start position:0%
competition on many occasions and it's
 
00:27:23.350 --> 00:27:23.360 align:start position:0%
really fun to see the excitement from
 
00:27:25.430 --> 00:27:25.440 align:start position:0%
the school kids as they produce a quart
 
00:27:27.510 --> 00:27:27.520 align:start position:0%
of maple syrup and they and for those
 
00:27:28.950 --> 00:27:28.960 align:start position:0%
who don't know it's it's basically a
 
00:27:31.430 --> 00:27:31.440 align:start position:0%
small competition where the students
 
00:27:32.630 --> 00:27:32.640 align:start position:0%
have to work you know they work with
 
00:27:35.029 --> 00:27:35.039 align:start position:0%
their teachers and they there's a few
 
00:27:36.470 --> 00:27:36.480 align:start position:0%
certain rules they have to follow they
 
00:27:38.230 --> 00:27:38.240 align:start position:0%
set taps they do the whole production
 
00:27:39.830 --> 00:27:39.840 align:start position:0%
and in some cases they get a little
 
00:27:41.029 --> 00:27:41.039 align:start position:0%
bigger than that they'll even get into
 
00:27:42.389 --> 00:27:42.399 align:start position:0%
some of the more innovative equipment
 
00:27:44.630 --> 00:27:44.640 align:start position:0%
like osmosis units and things of that
 
00:27:46.310 --> 00:27:46.320 align:start position:0%
nature but there's some a little bit of
 
00:27:48.710 --> 00:27:48.720 align:start position:0%
funding that comes from some of us that
 
00:27:50.149 --> 00:27:50.159 align:start position:0%
are involved in the industry that will
 
00:27:52.070 --> 00:27:52.080 align:start position:0%
help provide you know
 
00:27:53.830 --> 00:27:53.840 align:start position:0%
at cost equipment and things like that
 
00:27:56.630 --> 00:27:56.640 align:start position:0%
and donations are made at times and
 
00:27:57.990 --> 00:27:58.000 align:start position:0%
in the end there's a little competition
 
00:27:59.990 --> 00:28:00.000 align:start position:0%
where they put their court of syrup in
 
00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:00.789 align:start position:0%
where they put their court of syrup in
and

00:28:00.789 --> 00:28:00.799 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:28:02.149 --> 00:28:02.159 align:start position:0%
it's similar to what you'll see at the
 
00:28:04.710 --> 00:28:04.720 align:start position:0%
fair and i i've um
 
00:28:06.870 --> 00:28:06.880 align:start position:0%
i've helped to judge that competition
 
00:28:08.630 --> 00:28:08.640 align:start position:0%
there's a few criteria they have to meet
 
00:28:10.230 --> 00:28:10.240 align:start position:0%
it's really fun to for them to
 
00:28:11.990 --> 00:28:12.000 align:start position:0%
understand and learn uh you know the
 
00:28:14.070 --> 00:28:14.080 align:start position:0%
chemistry that is involved in production
 
00:28:16.070 --> 00:28:16.080 align:start position:0%
of syrup as well as just how they
 
00:28:18.070 --> 00:28:18.080 align:start position:0%
interact with the trees in the nature
 
00:28:19.510 --> 00:28:19.520 align:start position:0%
and in the end they get something really
 
00:28:22.870 --> 00:28:22.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:26.389 --> 00:28:26.399 align:start position:0%
well thank you very much yes represent
 
00:28:27.669 --> 00:28:27.679 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:28:29.590 --> 00:28:29.600 align:start position:0%
i apologize for being late and perhaps
 
00:28:32.070 --> 00:28:32.080 align:start position:0%
this was raised before i got here but
 
00:28:33.750 --> 00:28:33.760 align:start position:0%
i'm looking at this as a non-profit
 
00:28:35.190 --> 00:28:35.200 align:start position:0%
corporation where we've got the
 
00:28:37.750 --> 00:28:37.760 align:start position:0%
legislature appointing the membership
 
00:28:39.990 --> 00:28:40.000 align:start position:0%
and the leadership on it and then and
 
00:28:42.389 --> 00:28:42.399 align:start position:0%
and from a legal point that that just
 
00:28:43.990 --> 00:28:44.000 align:start position:0%
makes me uncomfortable i'm not sure that
 
00:28:46.149 --> 00:28:46.159 align:start position:0%
the we're not conflicting with the laws
 
00:28:48.389 --> 00:28:48.399 align:start position:0%
on creating nonprofit corporations and
 
00:28:50.389 --> 00:28:50.399 align:start position:0%
i'm wondering if you're aware of any
 
00:28:53.110 --> 00:28:53.120 align:start position:0%
other non-profit that is directed the
 
00:28:55.110 --> 00:28:55.120 align:start position:0%
same way by the legislature as this is
 
00:28:56.710 --> 00:28:56.720 align:start position:0%
where basically all the membership and
 
00:28:59.190 --> 00:28:59.200 align:start position:0%
the leadership and the terms are defined
 
00:29:01.990 --> 00:29:02.000 align:start position:0%
by the rsa but it's also a corporation
 
00:29:04.389 --> 00:29:04.399 align:start position:0%
it's just an unusual combination sure
 
00:29:06.230 --> 00:29:06.240 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question um
 
00:29:07.909 --> 00:29:07.919 align:start position:0%
again this bill
 
00:29:07.919 --> 00:29:08.710 align:start position:0%
again this bill
was

00:29:08.710 --> 00:29:08.720 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:29:10.630 --> 00:29:10.640 align:start position:0%
given to me by commissioner jasper he
 
00:29:12.149 --> 00:29:12.159 align:start position:0%
was looking at the current language that
 
00:29:13.430 --> 00:29:13.440 align:start position:0%
they had and he was fixing some
 
00:29:15.909 --> 00:29:15.919 align:start position:0%
conflicts that he saw and he did consult
 
00:29:17.669 --> 00:29:17.679 align:start position:0%
with the attorney general's office and
 
00:29:20.070 --> 00:29:20.080 align:start position:0%
they had a hand in writing this so i'm
 
00:29:21.430 --> 00:29:21.440 align:start position:0%
reasonably comfortable in saying that
 
00:29:23.029 --> 00:29:23.039 align:start position:0%
there shouldn't be any conflicts as much
 
00:29:25.350 --> 00:29:25.360 align:start position:0%
as i i could be it has been vetted
 
00:29:26.710 --> 00:29:26.720 align:start position:0%
through the proper channels to make sure
 
00:29:28.470 --> 00:29:28.480 align:start position:0%
that that doesn't exist
 
00:29:29.990 --> 00:29:30.000 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:29:32.070 --> 00:29:32.080 align:start position:0%
it is an unusual setup so but thank you
 
00:29:33.510 --> 00:29:33.520 align:start position:0%
certainly you're welcome
 
00:29:35.669 --> 00:29:35.679 align:start position:0%
okay not seeing any more hands and i
 
00:29:37.669 --> 00:29:37.679 align:start position:0%
know you have to run upstairs we
 
00:29:40.549 --> 00:29:40.559 align:start position:0%
appreciate you getting down to us again
 
00:29:43.110 --> 00:29:43.120 align:start position:0%
i apologize my apologies for being late
 
00:29:44.549 --> 00:29:44.559 align:start position:0%
and i hope you have a good rest of your
 
00:29:46.230 --> 00:29:46.240 align:start position:0%
day thank you thank you very much you
 
00:29:53.029 --> 00:29:53.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:54.710 --> 00:29:54.720 align:start position:0%
from others in the public so i'm going
 
00:29:56.710 --> 00:29:56.720 align:start position:0%
to close this hearing
 
00:30:00.389 --> 00:30:00.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:02.950 --> 00:30:02.960 align:start position:0%
okay in about two minutes we start off
 
00:30:10.710 --> 00:30:10.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:10.720 --> 00:30:22.710 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:30:22.710 --> 00:30:22.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:22.720 --> 00:30:42.149 align:start position:0%
 
uh

00:30:42.149 --> 00:30:42.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:45.350 --> 00:30:45.360 align:start position:0%
i can mention to all the folks here that
 
00:30:46.950 --> 00:30:46.960 align:start position:0%
i know that
 
00:30:48.630 --> 00:30:48.640 align:start position:0%
i'm looking at the list of membership on
 
00:30:50.070 --> 00:30:50.080 align:start position:0%
that last committee and the various
 
00:30:50.080 --> 00:30:51.590 align:start position:0%
that last committee and the various
associations

00:30:51.590 --> 00:30:51.600 align:start position:0%
associations
 
00:30:53.190 --> 00:30:53.200 align:start position:0%
and i can say that
 
00:30:55.669 --> 00:30:55.679 align:start position:0%
in in grafton county we still have a
 
00:30:58.630 --> 00:30:58.640 align:start position:0%
farm at grafton county and that works
 
00:31:00.549 --> 00:31:00.559 align:start position:0%
with the schools directly and brings
 
00:31:02.149 --> 00:31:02.159 align:start position:0%
them in when we grow the pumpkins the
 
00:31:05.669 --> 00:31:05.679 align:start position:0%
kids take pumpkins home going down uh
 
00:31:07.509 --> 00:31:07.519 align:start position:0%
all those the cooperative extension
 
00:31:09.110 --> 00:31:09.120 align:start position:0%
service out of grafton county works
 
00:31:11.350 --> 00:31:11.360 align:start position:0%
directly with the schools and goes in
 
00:31:13.269 --> 00:31:13.279 align:start position:0%
the maple syrup grows there's a museum
 
00:31:15.669 --> 00:31:15.679 align:start position:0%
that's part of the fair and they also
 
00:31:17.509 --> 00:31:17.519 align:start position:0%
get involved with making a maple syrup
 
00:31:19.190 --> 00:31:19.200 align:start position:0%
the kids sell christmas trees and that
 
00:31:21.509 --> 00:31:21.519 align:start position:0%
works with the christmas tree
 
00:31:21.519 --> 00:31:22.549 align:start position:0%
works with the christmas tree
uh

00:31:22.549 --> 00:31:22.559 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:31:25.110 --> 00:31:25.120 align:start position:0%
council there i i believe there's such a
 
00:31:28.310 --> 00:31:28.320 align:start position:0%
yeah the christmas tree promotion board
 
00:31:30.470 --> 00:31:30.480 align:start position:0%
and the dairy with hatchling dairy in
 
00:31:33.110 --> 00:31:33.120 align:start position:0%
town they do the same thing so
 
00:31:36.549 --> 00:31:36.559 align:start position:0%
agriculture in an agriculture community
 
00:31:38.149 --> 00:31:38.159 align:start position:0%
really benefits from these individual
 
00:31:39.669 --> 00:31:39.679 align:start position:0%
associations i don't know how they
 
00:31:41.509 --> 00:31:41.519 align:start position:0%
combine into
 
00:31:41.519 --> 00:31:42.549 align:start position:0%
combine into
one

00:31:42.549 --> 00:31:42.559 align:start position:0%
one
 
00:31:45.190 --> 00:31:45.200 align:start position:0%
community or one organization maybe that
 
00:31:47.590 --> 00:31:47.600 align:start position:0%
helps coordinate it but uh
 
00:31:50.070 --> 00:31:50.080 align:start position:0%
i'd like to pursue getting more
 
00:31:52.470 --> 00:31:52.480 align:start position:0%
information we will get
 
00:31:54.630 --> 00:31:54.640 align:start position:0%
commissioner sean jasper involved in
 
00:31:56.789 --> 00:31:56.799 align:start position:0%
this and try and get some more
 
00:31:59.590 --> 00:31:59.600 align:start position:0%
insight in terms of your questions
 
00:31:59.600 --> 00:32:00.630 align:start position:0%
insight in terms of your questions
yes

00:32:00.630 --> 00:32:00.640 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:32:03.430 --> 00:32:03.440 align:start position:0%
uh mr chair uh i'm wondering too how
 
00:32:05.669 --> 00:32:05.679 align:start position:0%
this coordinates with the unh extension
 
00:32:08.389 --> 00:32:08.399 align:start position:0%
service um and and wondering if we can
 
00:32:10.070 --> 00:32:10.080 align:start position:0%
get some information there as well
 
00:32:12.149 --> 00:32:12.159 align:start position:0%
that'd be fine and and that's the
 
00:32:13.750 --> 00:32:13.760 align:start position:0%
extension service i was talking about
 
00:32:16.149 --> 00:32:16.159 align:start position:0%
out of grafton county that is unh
 
00:32:17.830 --> 00:32:17.840 align:start position:0%
and so having a better understanding of
 
00:32:19.750 --> 00:32:19.760 align:start position:0%
how that works as well so
 
00:32:19.760 --> 00:32:20.710 align:start position:0%
how that works as well so
um

00:32:20.710 --> 00:32:20.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:32:32.630 --> 00:32:32.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:35.029 --> 00:32:35.039 align:start position:0%
yes yes that i i it's that right at the
 
00:32:41.590 --> 00:32:41.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:50.789 --> 00:32:50.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:52.630 --> 00:32:52.640 align:start position:0%
well that's another area we want to look
 
00:32:53.830 --> 00:32:53.840 align:start position:0%
at too uh
 
00:32:55.669 --> 00:32:55.679 align:start position:0%
the whole concept of this or the whole
 
00:32:55.679 --> 00:32:56.549 align:start position:0%
the whole concept of this or the whole
issue

00:32:56.549 --> 00:32:56.559 align:start position:0%
issue
 
00:32:58.149 --> 00:32:58.159 align:start position:0%
is just like the issue we had the other
 
00:32:59.509 --> 00:32:59.519 align:start position:0%
day where we were trying to find
 
00:33:01.590 --> 00:33:01.600 align:start position:0%
something in statutes not in statutor in
 
00:33:02.470 --> 00:33:02.480 align:start position:0%
our hard
 
00:33:02.480 --> 00:33:03.430 align:start position:0%
our hard
books

00:33:03.430 --> 00:33:03.440 align:start position:0%
books
 
00:33:05.190 --> 00:33:05.200 align:start position:0%
and this one too is another one that's
 
00:33:07.269 --> 00:33:07.279 align:start position:0%
the the first time i've ever dealt with
 
00:33:09.990 --> 00:33:10.000 align:start position:0%
this committee i've dealt with the the
 
00:33:11.590 --> 00:33:11.600 align:start position:0%
farm bureau i've dealt with all the
 
00:33:13.590 --> 00:33:13.600 align:start position:0%
individual associations
 
00:33:15.269 --> 00:33:15.279 align:start position:0%
closely in terms of
 
00:33:17.430 --> 00:33:17.440 align:start position:0%
uh property taxes
 
00:33:19.509 --> 00:33:19.519 align:start position:0%
assessing uh you know
 
00:33:21.269 --> 00:33:21.279 align:start position:0%
buildings on farms and all that with
 
00:33:23.750 --> 00:33:23.760 align:start position:0%
municipal and county government and et
 
00:33:26.389 --> 00:33:26.399 align:start position:0%
cetera but never this topic and
 
00:33:28.310 --> 00:33:28.320 align:start position:0%
it's interesting i'd like to know more
 
00:33:30.470 --> 00:33:30.480 align:start position:0%
about it so we'll get this and we'll
 
00:33:32.549 --> 00:33:32.559 align:start position:0%
continue working as uh
 
00:33:34.870 --> 00:33:34.880 align:start position:0%
maybe a committee of the whole and and
 
00:33:36.870 --> 00:33:36.880 align:start position:0%
and try to get more information before
 
00:33:40.710 --> 00:33:40.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:42.389 --> 00:33:42.399 align:start position:0%
okay with that we are
 
00:33:45.830 --> 00:33:45.840 align:start position:0%
flowing into the next uh part of our
 
00:33:48.310 --> 00:33:48.320 align:start position:0%
our a day's work
 
00:33:51.750 --> 00:33:51.760 align:start position:0%
hb 1058 relative to the time allowed for
 
00:33:51.760 --> 00:33:52.389 align:start position:0%
hb 1058 relative to the time allowed for
the

00:33:52.389 --> 00:33:52.399 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:33:55.029 --> 00:33:55.039 align:start position:0%
public school students to eat lunch
 
00:33:57.909 --> 00:33:57.919 align:start position:0%
the prime sponsor of the bill is
 
00:34:00.070 --> 00:34:00.080 align:start position:0%
with us
 
00:34:04.470 --> 00:34:04.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:08.470 --> 00:34:08.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:10.149 --> 00:34:10.159 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chair and thank you to
 
00:34:12.310 --> 00:34:12.320 align:start position:0%
the committee for having me back
 
00:34:13.430 --> 00:34:13.440 align:start position:0%
um i think i'm a little bit more
 
00:34:15.750 --> 00:34:15.760 align:start position:0%
prepared this time so i i hope that's
 
00:34:18.950 --> 00:34:18.960 align:start position:0%
appreciated um so house bill 1058 and
 
00:34:20.389 --> 00:34:20.399 align:start position:0%
act relative to the time allowed for
 
00:34:22.470 --> 00:34:22.480 align:start position:0%
public school students to eat lunch so
 
00:34:24.310 --> 00:34:24.320 align:start position:0%
first i'm going to explain exactly what
 
00:34:26.869 --> 00:34:26.879 align:start position:0%
this bill does not do to kind of dispel
 
00:34:26.879 --> 00:34:27.829 align:start position:0%
this bill does not do to kind of dispel
some

00:34:27.829 --> 00:34:27.839 align:start position:0%
some
 
00:34:28.710 --> 00:34:28.720 align:start position:0%
you know some maybe some
 
00:34:30.470 --> 00:34:30.480 align:start position:0%
misunderstandings that i've heard from
 
00:34:31.909 --> 00:34:31.919 align:start position:0%
either colleagues or possibly
 
00:34:33.669 --> 00:34:33.679 align:start position:0%
constituents and maybe other
 
00:34:35.829 --> 00:34:35.839 align:start position:0%
stakeholders too so this legislation
 
00:34:38.149 --> 00:34:38.159 align:start position:0%
does not mandate the time length of
 
00:34:39.990 --> 00:34:40.000 align:start position:0%
lunch periods theoretically schools
 
00:34:41.669 --> 00:34:41.679 align:start position:0%
could keep their current lunch period
 
00:34:43.430 --> 00:34:43.440 align:start position:0%
periods nearly unchanged and ensure
 
00:34:45.510 --> 00:34:45.520 align:start position:0%
children receive 20 minutes to sit and
 
00:34:46.950 --> 00:34:46.960 align:start position:0%
eat this could even happen in the
 
00:34:48.869 --> 00:34:48.879 align:start position:0%
classroom if a child received their meal
 
00:34:50.470 --> 00:34:50.480 align:start position:0%
towards the end of lunch the child could
 
00:34:52.310 --> 00:34:52.320 align:start position:0%
just stay and also finish their meal
 
00:34:54.629 --> 00:34:54.639 align:start position:0%
during the subsequent lunch block
 
00:34:56.550 --> 00:34:56.560 align:start position:0%
this legislation does not require the
 
00:34:58.790 --> 00:34:58.800 align:start position:0%
school day to become a lot longer if
 
00:35:00.230 --> 00:35:00.240 align:start position:0%
more lunch periods are necessary the
 
00:35:01.829 --> 00:35:01.839 align:start position:0%
school districts can have lunch periods
 
00:35:03.589 --> 00:35:03.599 align:start position:0%
that overlap school districts around the
 
00:35:06.310 --> 00:35:06.320 align:start position:0%
country do this this stuff so how would
 
00:35:07.670 --> 00:35:07.680 align:start position:0%
it kind of work is the first group of
 
00:35:09.510 --> 00:35:09.520 align:start position:0%
students would occupy only half the
 
00:35:10.950 --> 00:35:10.960 align:start position:0%
lunchroom these students would get their
 
00:35:12.550 --> 00:35:12.560 align:start position:0%
meals sit and eat then a new group of
 
00:35:14.470 --> 00:35:14.480 align:start position:0%
students would get their meals and fill
 
00:35:16.390 --> 00:35:16.400 align:start position:0%
up the lunchroom the original students
 
00:35:18.230 --> 00:35:18.240 align:start position:0%
that got the first meal would finish
 
00:35:19.750 --> 00:35:19.760 align:start position:0%
eating after 20 minutes and vacate the
 
00:35:21.270 --> 00:35:21.280 align:start position:0%
lunchroom and then a new group of
 
00:35:22.870 --> 00:35:22.880 align:start position:0%
students would begin receiving their
 
00:35:25.030 --> 00:35:25.040 align:start position:0%
meals after the second group is served
 
00:35:26.310 --> 00:35:26.320 align:start position:0%
and already sitting the cycle would
 
00:35:28.310 --> 00:35:28.320 align:start position:0%
continue and saves everyone time it
 
00:35:30.310 --> 00:35:30.320 align:start position:0%
means meals are served constantly and
 
00:35:31.990 --> 00:35:32.000 align:start position:0%
children are continuously eating and
 
00:35:34.069 --> 00:35:34.079 align:start position:0%
provided enough time it's done
 
00:35:35.670 --> 00:35:35.680 align:start position:0%
especially in a lot of urban settings
 
00:35:37.670 --> 00:35:37.680 align:start position:0%
where the infrastructure might become
 
00:35:39.589 --> 00:35:39.599 align:start position:0%
stressed this legislation does not
 
00:35:40.950 --> 00:35:40.960 align:start position:0%
change the amount of labor needed to
 
00:35:42.790 --> 00:35:42.800 align:start position:0%
prepare meals the number of meals served
 
00:35:44.069 --> 00:35:44.079 align:start position:0%
will not change unless a number of
 
00:35:46.150 --> 00:35:46.160 align:start position:0%
students changes this legislation will
 
00:35:47.910 --> 00:35:47.920 align:start position:0%
not force students to sit and eat for 20
 
00:35:49.750 --> 00:35:49.760 align:start position:0%
minutes schools are only required to
 
00:35:49.760 --> 00:35:51.030 align:start position:0%
minutes schools are only required to
provide

00:35:51.030 --> 00:35:51.040 align:start position:0%
provide
 
00:35:53.109 --> 00:35:53.119 align:start position:0%
20 minutes for eating if a student is
 
00:35:54.550 --> 00:35:54.560 align:start position:0%
done with lunch and does not want to
 
00:35:57.349 --> 00:35:57.359 align:start position:0%
stay the student's lunch can be finished
 
00:35:59.349 --> 00:35:59.359 align:start position:0%
teachers or parents do not oppose this
 
00:36:01.910 --> 00:36:01.920 align:start position:0%
legislation the teachers unions have
 
00:36:03.829 --> 00:36:03.839 align:start position:0%
been worked and consulted and to my
 
00:36:05.910 --> 00:36:05.920 align:start position:0%
understanding support the legislation
 
00:36:06.950 --> 00:36:06.960 align:start position:0%
because it would provide more
 
00:36:08.390 --> 00:36:08.400 align:start position:0%
preparatory time during the middle of
 
00:36:10.310 --> 00:36:10.320 align:start position:0%
the day and more substantial lunch break
 
00:36:12.470 --> 00:36:12.480 align:start position:0%
for teachers and decreases children's
 
00:36:14.390 --> 00:36:14.400 align:start position:0%
hunger in the classroom parents like
 
00:36:15.990 --> 00:36:16.000 align:start position:0%
this legislation because they want their
 
00:36:17.510 --> 00:36:17.520 align:start position:0%
children to eat not come home with half
 
00:36:19.990 --> 00:36:20.000 align:start position:0%
full lunch boxes parents also want their
 
00:36:22.230 --> 00:36:22.240 align:start position:0%
children to eat during lunch time and
 
00:36:24.710 --> 00:36:24.720 align:start position:0%
not you know eating outside of um you
 
00:36:26.230 --> 00:36:26.240 align:start position:0%
know very strange times in some school
 
00:36:27.829 --> 00:36:27.839 align:start position:0%
districts in the state sometimes lunches
 
00:36:29.910 --> 00:36:29.920 align:start position:0%
will even start at 10 10 o'clock 10 30
 
00:36:31.670 --> 00:36:31.680 align:start position:0%
in the morning to me that sounds a lot
 
00:36:33.190 --> 00:36:33.200 align:start position:0%
more like breakfast and less like lunch
 
00:36:34.470 --> 00:36:34.480 align:start position:0%
i guess it depends on when you wake up
 
00:36:36.310 --> 00:36:36.320 align:start position:0%
in the morning so what does this
 
00:36:38.390 --> 00:36:38.400 align:start position:0%
legislation precisely do
 
00:36:40.710 --> 00:36:40.720 align:start position:0%
house bill 1058 requires schools to give
 
00:36:42.870 --> 00:36:42.880 align:start position:0%
students 20 minutes to sit and eat as i
 
00:36:45.750 --> 00:36:45.760 align:start position:0%
mentioned in my testimony on house bill
 
00:36:48.230 --> 00:36:48.240 align:start position:0%
1561 that you heard last week relative
 
00:36:49.750 --> 00:36:49.760 align:start position:0%
to the school nutrition standards less
 
00:36:51.190 --> 00:36:51.200 align:start position:0%
hungry and healthier students perform
 
00:36:52.950 --> 00:36:52.960 align:start position:0%
better in the classroom leading federal
 
00:36:54.630 --> 00:36:54.640 align:start position:0%
agencies in the cdc suggests that
 
00:36:56.470 --> 00:36:56.480 align:start position:0%
children need 20 minutes to eat their
 
00:36:58.550 --> 00:36:58.560 align:start position:0%
meals the average student in america is
 
00:37:00.630 --> 00:37:00.640 align:start position:0%
only receiving 12 minutes to eat their
 
00:37:02.230 --> 00:37:02.240 align:start position:0%
meals right now
 
00:37:03.910 --> 00:37:03.920 align:start position:0%
allowing 20 minutes to eat leads to
 
00:37:05.270 --> 00:37:05.280 align:start position:0%
better success later in life and
 
00:37:07.349 --> 00:37:07.359 align:start position:0%
decreased costs for society according to

00:37:12.710 --> 00:37:12.720 align:start position:0%

have repeated agreed receive special

children who do not experience hunger
 
00:37:39.829 --> 00:37:39.839 align:start position:0%
hunger results in lost class time for
 
00:37:41.750 --> 00:37:41.760 align:start position:0%
students lower test scores lower
 
00:37:44.470 --> 00:37:44.480 align:start position:0%
academic achievement and
 
00:37:46.150 --> 00:37:46.160 align:start position:0%
it makes student making students less
 
00:37:47.829 --> 00:37:47.839 align:start position:0%
hungry and fulfilling their nutritional
 
00:37:49.510 --> 00:37:49.520 align:start position:0%
needs will hopefully help those who fall
 
00:37:50.950 --> 00:37:50.960 align:start position:0%
through the cracks that we see from time
 
00:37:53.190 --> 00:37:53.200 align:start position:0%
to time in our public education system
 
00:37:55.270 --> 00:37:55.280 align:start position:0%
1058 does require lunch to be served
 
00:37:57.670 --> 00:37:57.680 align:start position:0%
between the hours of 11am and 2pm why is
 
00:37:59.670 --> 00:37:59.680 align:start position:0%
this necessary well because some school
 
00:38:00.950 --> 00:38:00.960 align:start position:0%
districts will provide students with
 
00:38:02.950 --> 00:38:02.960 align:start position:0%
lunch with breakfast sorry excuse me
 
00:38:04.630 --> 00:38:04.640 align:start position:0%
with breakfast at around 8am and then
 
00:38:06.150 --> 00:38:06.160 align:start position:0%
students back for lunch sometimes at
 
00:38:08.069 --> 00:38:08.079 align:start position:0%
around 10 a.m i'm unsure if anyone
 
00:38:09.750 --> 00:38:09.760 align:start position:0%
willingly eats on this schedule anywhere
 
00:38:11.349 --> 00:38:11.359 align:start position:0%
else in our society
 
00:38:12.950 --> 00:38:12.960 align:start position:0%
but schools force students to do this
 
00:38:15.270 --> 00:38:15.280 align:start position:0%
every day in new hampshire eating lunch
 
00:38:17.270 --> 00:38:17.280 align:start position:0%
and breakfast in such a short period of
 
00:38:19.349 --> 00:38:19.359 align:start position:0%
time makes younger and older students
 
00:38:21.349 --> 00:38:21.359 align:start position:0%
famish by the afternoon which will hurt
 
00:38:23.030 --> 00:38:23.040 align:start position:0%
their concentration
 
00:38:24.390 --> 00:38:24.400 align:start position:0%
students will then struggle to
 
00:38:26.390 --> 00:38:26.400 align:start position:0%
concentrate in the class and this eating
 
00:38:27.750 --> 00:38:27.760 align:start position:0%
schedule also messes up families
 
00:38:29.510 --> 00:38:29.520 align:start position:0%
scheduling of nightly supper and hurts
 
00:38:31.510 --> 00:38:31.520 align:start position:0%
young metabolisms right so if you have
 
00:38:32.950 --> 00:38:32.960 align:start position:0%
students that come home at three o'clock
 
00:38:34.630 --> 00:38:34.640 align:start position:0%
that would like another meal it might
 
00:38:36.630 --> 00:38:36.640 align:start position:0%
mess up you know a planned meal for five
 
00:38:38.069 --> 00:38:38.079 align:start position:0%
to six o'clock they may not eat their
 
00:38:39.109 --> 00:38:39.119 align:start position:0%
entire meal that might be more
 
00:38:41.750 --> 00:38:41.760 align:start position:0%
nutritious in an at-home snack so and
 
00:38:43.589 --> 00:38:43.599 align:start position:0%
not to mention the metabolism part it's
 
00:38:46.390 --> 00:38:46.400 align:start position:0%
not good for young metabolism to be fed
 
00:38:49.109 --> 00:38:49.119 align:start position:0%
so much in the morning and then to wait
 
00:38:51.109 --> 00:38:51.119 align:start position:0%
so long for another prepared meal later
 
00:38:54.069 --> 00:38:54.079 align:start position:0%
on in the day from once they get home so
 
00:38:56.630 --> 00:38:56.640 align:start position:0%
um one last point is a socialized the
 
00:38:58.950 --> 00:38:58.960 align:start position:0%
socialization aspect of lunch is vital
 
00:39:00.390 --> 00:39:00.400 align:start position:0%
to children too it is essential that
 
00:39:02.470 --> 00:39:02.480 align:start position:0%
students sit eat and socialize with
 
00:39:04.630 --> 00:39:04.640 align:start position:0%
their peers this helps children develop
 
00:39:06.310 --> 00:39:06.320 align:start position:0%
and blow off steam as americans we have
 
00:39:08.069 --> 00:39:08.079 align:start position:0%
sort of forgotten how important it is to
 
00:39:10.470 --> 00:39:10.480 align:start position:0%
sit down together for our meals even at
 
00:39:12.390 --> 00:39:12.400 align:start position:0%
an evening supper so uh i hope this
 
00:39:14.630 --> 00:39:14.640 align:start position:0%
clarifies house bill 1058 i'll remain
 
00:39:16.310 --> 00:39:16.320 align:start position:0%
open to any questions thank you very
 
00:39:16.320 --> 00:39:17.910 align:start position:0%
open to any questions thank you very
much

00:39:17.910 --> 00:39:17.920 align:start position:0%
much
 
00:39:19.190 --> 00:39:19.200 align:start position:0%
are there any questions from the
 
00:39:20.310 --> 00:39:20.320 align:start position:0%
committee on this representative
 
00:39:20.320 --> 00:39:21.589 align:start position:0%
committee on this representative
cordelli

00:39:21.589 --> 00:39:21.599 align:start position:0%
cordelli
 
00:39:23.349 --> 00:39:23.359 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman uh thank you
 
00:39:23.359 --> 00:39:24.790 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman uh thank you
representative

00:39:24.790 --> 00:39:24.800 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:39:24.800 --> 00:39:26.390 align:start position:0%
representative
um

00:39:26.390 --> 00:39:26.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:39:28.950 --> 00:39:28.960 align:start position:0%
20 minutes of seated time
 
00:39:32.230 --> 00:39:32.240 align:start position:0%
separate from the full lunch period
 
00:39:32.240 --> 00:39:33.349 align:start position:0%
separate from the full lunch period
um

00:39:33.349 --> 00:39:33.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:39:35.349 --> 00:39:35.359 align:start position:0%
do you expect i don't know if you have
 
00:39:36.870 --> 00:39:36.880 align:start position:0%
any children
 
00:39:39.030 --> 00:39:39.040 align:start position:0%
but do you expect elementary school
 
00:39:41.510 --> 00:39:41.520 align:start position:0%
children to remain seated
 
00:39:44.230 --> 00:39:44.240 align:start position:0%
for 20 minutes
 
00:39:48.550 --> 00:39:48.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:50.550 --> 00:39:50.560 align:start position:0%
i would not expect children to sit for
 
00:39:52.230 --> 00:39:52.240 align:start position:0%
20 minutes and the bill doesn't mandate
 
00:39:54.150 --> 00:39:54.160 align:start position:0%
that children sit
 
00:39:55.829 --> 00:39:55.839 align:start position:0%
i would i would find that mandate to be
 
00:39:59.190 --> 00:39:59.200 align:start position:0%
impossible to uh to enforce um it just
 
00:40:01.510 --> 00:40:01.520 align:start position:0%
requires schools to provide 20 minutes
 
00:40:02.710 --> 00:40:02.720 align:start position:0%
and who would keep track of the 20
 
00:40:03.990 --> 00:40:04.000 align:start position:0%
minutes would be
 
00:40:06.710 --> 00:40:06.720 align:start position:0%
presumably the faculty and the
 
00:40:08.870 --> 00:40:08.880 align:start position:0%
administrators in the room who are
 
00:40:10.309 --> 00:40:10.319 align:start position:0%
already making sure that children are
 
00:40:12.230 --> 00:40:12.240 align:start position:0%
coming and going from the lunchroom
 
00:40:13.990 --> 00:40:14.000 align:start position:0%
making sure that they're eating at the
 
00:40:15.589 --> 00:40:15.599 align:start position:0%
proper time period that the school's
 
00:40:17.829 --> 00:40:17.839 align:start position:0%
already allotting for and that they're
 
00:40:19.990 --> 00:40:20.000 align:start position:0%
going to and from the classroom properly
 
00:40:21.430 --> 00:40:21.440 align:start position:0%
and respectfully
 
00:40:23.109 --> 00:40:23.119 align:start position:0%
to my understanding that's what uh when
 
00:40:24.630 --> 00:40:24.640 align:start position:0%
having conversations with the school
 
00:40:26.710 --> 00:40:26.720 align:start position:0%
administrators association the school
 
00:40:28.790 --> 00:40:28.800 align:start position:0%
board association that's how they viewed
 
00:40:31.030 --> 00:40:31.040 align:start position:0%
the enforcement would happen
 
00:40:31.040 --> 00:40:32.390 align:start position:0%
the enforcement would happen
follow-up

00:40:32.390 --> 00:40:32.400 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
00:40:33.670 --> 00:40:33.680 align:start position:0%
yes thank you
 
00:40:35.829 --> 00:40:35.839 align:start position:0%
um on line 11
 
00:40:39.510 --> 00:40:39.520 align:start position:0%
you specify the times for lunch periods
 
00:40:42.309 --> 00:40:42.319 align:start position:0%
but exemptions may apply for shortened
 
00:40:42.319 --> 00:40:43.750 align:start position:0%
but exemptions may apply for shortened
days

00:40:43.750 --> 00:40:43.760 align:start position:0%
days
 
00:40:43.760 --> 00:40:44.630 align:start position:0%
days
so

00:40:44.630 --> 00:40:44.640 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:40:48.230 --> 00:40:48.240 align:start position:0%
for an exemption from that time period
 
00:40:53.589 --> 00:40:53.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:55.349 --> 00:40:55.359 align:start position:0%
i think it's kind of similar to how it
 
00:40:56.790 --> 00:40:56.800 align:start position:0%
currently works in a lot of school
 
00:40:58.950 --> 00:40:58.960 align:start position:0%
districts where for example if you have
 
00:41:01.430 --> 00:41:01.440 align:start position:0%
a a delay in the school day you might
 
00:41:03.030 --> 00:41:03.040 align:start position:0%
end up serving lunch maybe a little bit
 
00:41:03.040 --> 00:41:03.990 align:start position:0%
end up serving lunch maybe a little bit
later

00:41:03.990 --> 00:41:04.000 align:start position:0%
later
 
00:41:05.670 --> 00:41:05.680 align:start position:0%
you might go outside of that two o'clock
 
00:41:06.950 --> 00:41:06.960 align:start position:0%
time frame
 
00:41:08.309 --> 00:41:08.319 align:start position:0%
i would assume the exemption would come
 
00:41:09.910 --> 00:41:09.920 align:start position:0%
from the department of education but i
 
00:41:11.510 --> 00:41:11.520 align:start position:0%
could be mistaken that might be a better
 
00:41:14.470 --> 00:41:14.480 align:start position:0%
question for the department
 
00:41:16.069 --> 00:41:16.079 align:start position:0%
are there further questions of the
 
00:41:17.910 --> 00:41:17.920 align:start position:0%
presenter representative woodcock and
 
00:41:19.670 --> 00:41:19.680 align:start position:0%
then representative bowm
 
00:41:21.910 --> 00:41:21.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for the trap all right
 
00:41:23.750 --> 00:41:23.760 align:start position:0%
whenever the shades are doing
 
00:41:25.270 --> 00:41:25.280 align:start position:0%
good to see you again i'm well thank you
 
00:41:26.790 --> 00:41:26.800 align:start position:0%
representing woodcock um just a quick
 
00:41:28.950 --> 00:41:28.960 align:start position:0%
question uh brodie in your dialogue
 
00:41:31.430 --> 00:41:31.440 align:start position:0%
you're talking about um
 
00:41:33.670 --> 00:41:33.680 align:start position:0%
youngsters 1984 11 because they start on
 
00:41:36.069 --> 00:41:36.079 align:start position:0%
eight issues very small i get that so
 
00:41:37.349 --> 00:41:37.359 align:start position:0%
some of the high schools have started
 
00:41:39.109 --> 00:41:39.119 align:start position:0%
seven and seven fifteen
 
00:41:40.710 --> 00:41:40.720 align:start position:0%
would this be able to be moved back or
 
00:41:42.870 --> 00:41:42.880 align:start position:0%
you still want to stay leveraged frame
 
00:41:45.190 --> 00:41:45.200 align:start position:0%
i i would be um i'd be more than amiable
 
00:41:47.589 --> 00:41:47.599 align:start position:0%
to any kind of amendment to expanding
 
00:41:50.710 --> 00:41:50.720 align:start position:0%
the 11 to 2 o'clock frame maybe to 10 30
 
00:41:54.069 --> 00:41:54.079 align:start position:0%
to 2 30 to um
 
00:41:55.670 --> 00:41:55.680 align:start position:0%
yeah to correspond with earlier schools
 
00:41:57.349 --> 00:41:57.359 align:start position:0%
that may start earlier i think that's a
 
00:41:59.270 --> 00:41:59.280 align:start position:0%
i think that's a good idea i still think
 
00:42:00.710 --> 00:42:00.720 align:start position:0%
according to you know a number of
 
00:42:02.390 --> 00:42:02.400 align:start position:0%
federal studies and studies done by
 
00:42:05.030 --> 00:42:05.040 align:start position:0%
research institutions um nonpartisan
 
00:42:06.950 --> 00:42:06.960 align:start position:0%
research institutions it still says that
 
00:42:08.390 --> 00:42:08.400 align:start position:0%
students even if they are eating
 
00:42:10.150 --> 00:42:10.160 align:start position:0%
breakfast maybe at seven the best time
 
00:42:11.349 --> 00:42:11.359 align:start position:0%
to eat lunch is still between ten
 
00:42:13.030 --> 00:42:13.040 align:start position:0%
o'clock and two o'clock but i understand
 
00:42:15.030 --> 00:42:15.040 align:start position:0%
we have to be flexible so i i think
 
00:42:16.870 --> 00:42:16.880 align:start position:0%
that's a more than
 
00:42:19.030 --> 00:42:19.040 align:start position:0%
reasonable approach thank you thank you
 
00:42:21.910 --> 00:42:21.920 align:start position:0%
mr chairman representative
 
00:42:23.430 --> 00:42:23.440 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you taking
 
00:42:24.790 --> 00:42:24.800 align:start position:0%
the question
 
00:42:26.950 --> 00:42:26.960 align:start position:0%
uh i know some school districts have a
 
00:42:28.710 --> 00:42:28.720 align:start position:0%
problem with the number of students in
 
00:42:30.710 --> 00:42:30.720 align:start position:0%
the school and the size of their
 
00:42:34.230 --> 00:42:34.240 align:start position:0%
cafeteria they have a problem scheduling
 
00:42:36.230 --> 00:42:36.240 align:start position:0%
so don't you think in some cases this
 
00:42:38.550 --> 00:42:38.560 align:start position:0%
might need a financial note
 
00:42:40.790 --> 00:42:40.800 align:start position:0%
to apply for the hour the number of
 
00:42:40.800 --> 00:42:41.910 align:start position:0%
to apply for the hour the number of
hours

00:42:41.910 --> 00:42:41.920 align:start position:0%
hours
 
00:42:42.829 --> 00:42:42.839 align:start position:0%
you're only
 
00:42:45.829 --> 00:42:45.839 align:start position:0%
allowing three hours for lunch
 
00:42:47.670 --> 00:42:47.680 align:start position:0%
and in some cases it might take longer
 
00:42:50.390 --> 00:42:50.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:51.589 --> 00:42:51.599 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for your question
 
00:42:53.430 --> 00:42:53.440 align:start position:0%
representative um
 
00:42:55.670 --> 00:42:55.680 align:start position:0%
i don't think it would require a local
 
00:42:57.510 --> 00:42:57.520 align:start position:0%
fiscal note because as i mentioned
 
00:42:59.190 --> 00:42:59.200 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of ways for schools to
 
00:43:00.630 --> 00:43:00.640 align:start position:0%
work their schedule to make it so then
 
00:43:03.190 --> 00:43:03.200 align:start position:0%
there would be no cost and these are
 
00:43:05.030 --> 00:43:05.040 align:start position:0%
it's not like reinventing the wheel
 
00:43:06.710 --> 00:43:06.720 align:start position:0%
these are solutions that are used across
 
00:43:08.309 --> 00:43:08.319 align:start position:0%
the country by school districts that are
 
00:43:12.390 --> 00:43:12.400 align:start position:0%
both rural and urban um i don't think
 
00:43:13.910 --> 00:43:13.920 align:start position:0%
that it would require any more labor
 
00:43:15.910 --> 00:43:15.920 align:start position:0%
because the same amount of meals will be
 
00:43:17.430 --> 00:43:17.440 align:start position:0%
served to the same amount of students as
 
00:43:19.430 --> 00:43:19.440 align:start position:0%
we're being served before
 
00:43:21.510 --> 00:43:21.520 align:start position:0%
so and also technically speaking you're
 
00:43:22.870 --> 00:43:22.880 align:start position:0%
also shortening up the amount of time
 
00:43:24.870 --> 00:43:24.880 align:start position:0%
that lunch is served so you might
 
00:43:27.030 --> 00:43:27.040 align:start position:0%
actually end up seeing uh you know the
 
00:43:30.390 --> 00:43:30.400 align:start position:0%
the number of hours for food workers um
 
00:43:31.910 --> 00:43:31.920 align:start position:0%
sorry that that's not the best term to
 
00:43:33.190 --> 00:43:33.200 align:start position:0%
use for people who are serving these
 
00:43:34.550 --> 00:43:34.560 align:start position:0%
meals to students it might end up
 
00:43:35.670 --> 00:43:35.680 align:start position:0%
shortening their day right because if
 
00:43:37.510 --> 00:43:37.520 align:start position:0%
they're only serving lunch from 11 to
 
00:43:40.630 --> 00:43:40.640 align:start position:0%
two rather than serving from 10 to 3
 
00:43:42.550 --> 00:43:42.560 align:start position:0%
right that saves them more time to prep
 
00:43:44.230 --> 00:43:44.240 align:start position:0%
in the beginning of the day more time to
 
00:43:45.510 --> 00:43:45.520 align:start position:0%
prep at the end of the day and they
 
00:43:47.109 --> 00:43:47.119 align:start position:0%
might have to they might not show up to
 
00:43:48.630 --> 00:43:48.640 align:start position:0%
school as early anymore and they might
 
00:43:49.589 --> 00:43:49.599 align:start position:0%
be able to leave from the school
 
00:43:53.510 --> 00:43:53.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:55.430 --> 00:43:55.440 align:start position:0%
follow up thank you
 
00:43:57.109 --> 00:43:57.119 align:start position:0%
i'm thinking missed the question the
 
00:43:59.910 --> 00:43:59.920 align:start position:0%
question is the size of the cafeteria
 
00:44:02.230 --> 00:44:02.240 align:start position:0%
may result in needing more than three
 
00:44:04.390 --> 00:44:04.400 align:start position:0%
hours even if if we go with the 20
 
00:44:06.550 --> 00:44:06.560 align:start position:0%
minutes and 30 minutes so that would
 
00:44:08.870 --> 00:44:08.880 align:start position:0%
require the school to
 
00:44:11.190 --> 00:44:11.200 align:start position:0%
add on to the cafeteria
 
00:44:13.829 --> 00:44:13.839 align:start position:0%
and that's my question why a financial
 
00:44:16.550 --> 00:44:16.560 align:start position:0%
note might be needed
 
00:44:18.550 --> 00:44:18.560 align:start position:0%
um well thank you for clarifying
 
00:44:19.990 --> 00:44:20.000 align:start position:0%
representative my apologies for not
 
00:44:21.589 --> 00:44:21.599 align:start position:0%
answering your your initial question i
 
00:44:23.270 --> 00:44:23.280 align:start position:0%
thought i had understood it
 
00:44:24.790 --> 00:44:24.800 align:start position:0%
i still i don't think it would
 
00:44:26.390 --> 00:44:26.400 align:start position:0%
necessarily be needed to expand the
 
00:44:28.470 --> 00:44:28.480 align:start position:0%
cafeterias if school districts work
 
00:44:30.390 --> 00:44:30.400 align:start position:0%
their schedules properly with kind of
 
00:44:32.390 --> 00:44:32.400 align:start position:0%
how i described overlapping lunch
 
00:44:33.990 --> 00:44:34.000 align:start position:0%
periods for students
 
00:44:35.910 --> 00:44:35.920 align:start position:0%
maybe i'm mistaken though but i think it
 
00:44:37.990 --> 00:44:38.000 align:start position:0%
would be able to work without a fiscal
 
00:44:39.829 --> 00:44:39.839 align:start position:0%
note but that might be something worth
 
00:44:41.589 --> 00:44:41.599 align:start position:0%
asking um maybe the department of
 
00:44:41.599 --> 00:44:43.190 align:start position:0%
asking um maybe the department of
education

00:44:43.190 --> 00:44:43.200 align:start position:0%
education
 
00:44:44.630 --> 00:44:44.640 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee
 
00:44:46.230 --> 00:44:46.240 align:start position:0%
representative cornell
 
00:44:47.670 --> 00:44:47.680 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking my
 
00:44:50.470 --> 00:44:50.480 align:start position:0%
question um this is another the ideas i
 
00:44:52.230 --> 00:44:52.240 align:start position:0%
think are great but do you not think
 
00:44:53.589 --> 00:44:53.599 align:start position:0%
maybe it's better to leave it up to
 
00:44:55.910 --> 00:44:55.920 align:start position:0%
local control where they know
 
00:44:57.910 --> 00:44:57.920 align:start position:0%
how long it takes their students to eat
 
00:45:00.069 --> 00:45:00.079 align:start position:0%
what time their students are arriving at
 
00:45:01.670 --> 00:45:01.680 align:start position:0%
school you know i know just for an
 
00:45:04.150 --> 00:45:04.160 align:start position:0%
example i know the hooks students go to
 
00:45:06.390 --> 00:45:06.400 align:start position:0%
pinkerton academy in derry
 
00:45:07.910 --> 00:45:07.920 align:start position:0%
uh for high school
 
00:45:10.710 --> 00:45:10.720 align:start position:0%
they're on the bus probably 45 minutes
 
00:45:12.309 --> 00:45:12.319 align:start position:0%
to an hour i'm sure they're leaving
 
00:45:15.430 --> 00:45:15.440 align:start position:0%
their houses by 6 30 in the morning you
 
00:45:17.670 --> 00:45:17.680 align:start position:0%
know they they're probably very hungry
 
00:45:19.349 --> 00:45:19.359 align:start position:0%
by 10 30
 
00:45:22.230 --> 00:45:22.240 align:start position:0%
a.m so it's it's up
 
00:45:24.150 --> 00:45:24.160 align:start position:0%
i think every school every district
 
00:45:24.160 --> 00:45:25.270 align:start position:0%
i think every school every district
knows

00:45:25.270 --> 00:45:25.280 align:start position:0%
knows
 
00:45:28.230 --> 00:45:28.240 align:start position:0%
what their students want and i and as
 
00:45:30.790 --> 00:45:30.800 align:start position:0%
someone who's done lunch duty i think
 
00:45:32.870 --> 00:45:32.880 align:start position:0%
saying that students can't sit still for
 
00:45:37.430 --> 00:45:37.440 align:start position:0%
20 minutes if you in fact let a whole
 
00:45:39.190 --> 00:45:39.200 align:start position:0%
grade of students
 
00:45:40.710 --> 00:45:40.720 align:start position:0%
get up out of their seats and start
 
00:45:43.589 --> 00:45:43.599 align:start position:0%
wandering around the cafeteria it's
 
00:45:49.829 --> 00:45:49.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:52.150 --> 00:45:52.160 align:start position:0%
i you know socializing around their
 
00:45:53.910 --> 00:45:53.920 align:start position:0%
table always happens and is great and
 
00:45:56.230 --> 00:45:56.240 align:start position:0%
they get to choose who they eat with but
 
00:45:58.470 --> 00:45:58.480 align:start position:0%
students getting up and socializing all
 
00:46:00.630 --> 00:46:00.640 align:start position:0%
around the whole cafeteria
 
00:46:02.950 --> 00:46:02.960 align:start position:0%
it doesn't work but but
 
00:46:04.550 --> 00:46:04.560 align:start position:0%
it's a good idea thank you well thank
 
00:46:05.910 --> 00:46:05.920 align:start position:0%
you for your uh your question
 
00:46:08.230 --> 00:46:08.240 align:start position:0%
representative and um i i don't think
 
00:46:10.390 --> 00:46:10.400 align:start position:0%
the bill would in any way require uh
 
00:46:12.309 --> 00:46:12.319 align:start position:0%
schools to have children walk around the
 
00:46:14.790 --> 00:46:14.800 align:start position:0%
cafeteria socializing
 
00:46:17.109 --> 00:46:17.119 align:start position:0%
i think i think it would only require
 
00:46:18.710 --> 00:46:18.720 align:start position:0%
them to be
 
00:46:21.589 --> 00:46:21.599 align:start position:0%
to for schools to provide 20 minutes if
 
00:46:23.829 --> 00:46:23.839 align:start position:0%
the student chooses to utilize that 20
 
00:46:25.670 --> 00:46:25.680 align:start position:0%
minutes i also think i'm an important
 
00:46:27.030 --> 00:46:27.040 align:start position:0%
thing that we have to remember in new
 
00:46:28.790 --> 00:46:28.800 align:start position:0%
hampshire as well we like to preserve
 
00:46:31.510 --> 00:46:31.520 align:start position:0%
local control as much as we can
 
00:46:32.710 --> 00:46:32.720 align:start position:0%
new hampshire's still a dylan rural
 
00:46:34.790 --> 00:46:34.800 align:start position:0%
state so it's pretty regular for the
 
00:46:36.950 --> 00:46:36.960 align:start position:0%
state to set guard rails and guidelines
 
00:46:38.950 --> 00:46:38.960 align:start position:0%
for kind of basic expectations for how
 
00:46:41.430 --> 00:46:41.440 align:start position:0%
local governments treat their uh treat
 
00:46:43.190 --> 00:46:43.200 align:start position:0%
our constituents right and how they
 
00:46:45.109 --> 00:46:45.119 align:start position:0%
serve those constituents and you know
 
00:46:47.270 --> 00:46:47.280 align:start position:0%
very regularly um committees you know
 
00:46:49.670 --> 00:46:49.680 align:start position:0%
such as this one too will will create
 
00:46:51.990 --> 00:46:52.000 align:start position:0%
and formulate legislation working with
 
00:46:53.750 --> 00:46:53.760 align:start position:0%
stakeholders to establish those
 
00:46:56.309 --> 00:46:56.319 align:start position:0%
guidelines of how public education and
 
00:46:57.670 --> 00:46:57.680 align:start position:0%
and uh you know a number of other
 
00:46:59.510 --> 00:46:59.520 align:start position:0%
educational choices how they'll look
 
00:47:01.109 --> 00:47:01.119 align:start position:0%
throughout the state so um i can
 
00:47:02.790 --> 00:47:02.800 align:start position:0%
understand why some people might be
 
00:47:04.550 --> 00:47:04.560 align:start position:0%
concerned about losing some aspect of
 
00:47:06.470 --> 00:47:06.480 align:start position:0%
local control but i think another every
 
00:47:10.710 --> 00:47:10.720 align:start position:0%
other are provided 30 minutes to eat
 
00:47:19.990 --> 00:47:20.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:20.950 --> 00:47:20.960 align:start position:0%
when the average student in new
 
00:47:22.710 --> 00:47:22.720 align:start position:0%
hampshire is only getting about 12
 
00:47:24.390 --> 00:47:24.400 align:start position:0%
minutes to eat
 
00:47:26.309 --> 00:47:26.319 align:start position:0%
i think it makes sense to uh to kind of
 
00:47:27.829 --> 00:47:27.839 align:start position:0%
address that concern it's a concern
 
00:47:30.309 --> 00:47:30.319 align:start position:0%
that's been raised to me in my time as
 
00:47:32.549 --> 00:47:32.559 align:start position:0%
being a legislator from parents
 
00:47:33.910 --> 00:47:33.920 align:start position:0%
it's a concern that's actually been
 
00:47:35.990 --> 00:47:36.000 align:start position:0%
brought up a lot to the department of
 
00:47:37.910 --> 00:47:37.920 align:start position:0%
education when speaking with them they
 
00:47:39.349 --> 00:47:39.359 align:start position:0%
said it was actually a very large
 
00:47:41.349 --> 00:47:41.359 align:start position:0%
complaint that they received it tend to
 
00:47:41.359 --> 00:47:42.230 align:start position:0%
complaint that they received it tend to
be

00:47:42.230 --> 00:47:42.240 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:47:43.910 --> 00:47:43.920 align:start position:0%
a number of coveted restrictions or lack
 
00:47:45.910 --> 00:47:45.920 align:start position:0%
thereof and then this was typically the
 
00:47:47.670 --> 00:47:47.680 align:start position:0%
next biggest issue that was on parents
 
00:47:48.950 --> 00:47:48.960 align:start position:0%
minds and um
 
00:47:50.630 --> 00:47:50.640 align:start position:0%
you know you are right it does vary
 
00:47:52.309 --> 00:47:52.319 align:start position:0%
depending on the on the school district
 
00:47:53.829 --> 00:47:53.839 align:start position:0%
but i still think you know there's ways
 
00:47:55.430 --> 00:47:55.440 align:start position:0%
for the committee to formulate this
 
00:47:56.870 --> 00:47:56.880 align:start position:0%
legislation to continue working with the
 
00:47:58.069 --> 00:47:58.079 align:start position:0%
stakeholders because i've done a lot
 
00:48:00.069 --> 00:48:00.079 align:start position:0%
working with them on speaking with them
 
00:48:02.549 --> 00:48:02.559 align:start position:0%
and having a dialogue with them to um to
 
00:48:05.270 --> 00:48:05.280 align:start position:0%
make it so this legislation could be um
 
00:48:07.349 --> 00:48:07.359 align:start position:0%
could be easy for school districts to
 
00:48:09.030 --> 00:48:09.040 align:start position:0%
implement and to handle okay we need to
 
00:48:10.150 --> 00:48:10.160 align:start position:0%
go on another question because we're
 
00:48:11.270 --> 00:48:11.280 align:start position:0%
running out of time representative
 
00:48:11.280 --> 00:48:12.950 align:start position:0%
running out of time representative
apologies

00:48:12.950 --> 00:48:12.960 align:start position:0%
apologies
 
00:48:15.109 --> 00:48:15.119 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
00:48:17.349 --> 00:48:17.359 align:start position:0%
filing this bill having been a teacher
 
00:48:19.750 --> 00:48:19.760 align:start position:0%
in elementary school with a 12-minute
 
00:48:19.760 --> 00:48:20.870 align:start position:0%
in elementary school with a 12-minute
lunch

00:48:20.870 --> 00:48:20.880 align:start position:0%
lunch
 
00:48:24.230 --> 00:48:24.240 align:start position:0%
honest on a day when i have recess duty
 
00:48:26.069 --> 00:48:26.079 align:start position:0%
was definitely a stressor and i think i
 
00:48:28.390 --> 00:48:28.400 align:start position:0%
appreciate your efforts i'm concerned
 
00:48:31.030 --> 00:48:31.040 align:start position:0%
did you when you were talking with um
 
00:48:33.349 --> 00:48:33.359 align:start position:0%
stakeholders about this what did they
 
00:48:36.150 --> 00:48:36.160 align:start position:0%
talk about with recess especially in the
 
00:48:38.470 --> 00:48:38.480 align:start position:0%
lower grades usually the way it works
 
00:48:40.069 --> 00:48:40.079 align:start position:0%
the kids
 
00:48:41.750 --> 00:48:41.760 align:start position:0%
got if you get them to wash your hands
 
00:48:43.750 --> 00:48:43.760 align:start position:0%
their hands before you they go to lunch
 
00:48:45.750 --> 00:48:45.760 align:start position:0%
then it could be a half an hour before
 
00:48:47.190 --> 00:48:47.200 align:start position:0%
lunch and then they go in and have their
 
00:48:49.910 --> 00:48:49.920 align:start position:0%
lunch and then they go out and play
 
00:48:51.990 --> 00:48:52.000 align:start position:0%
how would that work with this how would
 
00:48:53.990 --> 00:48:54.000 align:start position:0%
that have you did you
 
00:48:57.430 --> 00:48:57.440 align:start position:0%
run into any concerns with recess
 
00:48:59.670 --> 00:48:59.680 align:start position:0%
if this bill were to pass or among the
 
00:49:01.430 --> 00:49:01.440 align:start position:0%
stakeholders and that like
 
00:49:04.069 --> 00:49:04.079 align:start position:0%
the teachers unions and the
 
00:49:04.079 --> 00:49:05.750 align:start position:0%
the teachers unions and the
associated

00:49:05.750 --> 00:49:05.760 align:start position:0%
associated
 
00:49:08.150 --> 00:49:08.160 align:start position:0%
i'll be brief in the interest of time um
 
00:49:10.069 --> 00:49:10.079 align:start position:0%
uh no no one brought up any concern
 
00:49:12.870 --> 00:49:12.880 align:start position:0%
about this conflicting or um in any way
 
00:49:14.390 --> 00:49:14.400 align:start position:0%
kind of creating a scheduling conflict
 
00:49:17.270 --> 00:49:17.280 align:start position:0%
with recess thank you
 
00:49:18.710 --> 00:49:18.720 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
00:49:20.549 --> 00:49:20.559 align:start position:0%
yes representative nelson thank you for
 
00:49:21.910 --> 00:49:21.920 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
00:49:24.150 --> 00:49:24.160 align:start position:0%
early release what happens on that day
 
00:49:25.670 --> 00:49:25.680 align:start position:0%
the school has to close because of a
 
00:49:27.990 --> 00:49:28.000 align:start position:0%
snowstorm and my second one is i see
 
00:49:29.510 --> 00:49:29.520 align:start position:0%
here in the rochester middle school here
 
00:49:31.589 --> 00:49:31.599 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire they sometimes have a
 
00:49:36.790 --> 00:49:36.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:39.670 --> 00:49:39.680 align:start position:0%
so i think i think the uh for example
 
00:49:41.030 --> 00:49:41.040 align:start position:0%
when we have the exemptions may apply
 
00:49:42.390 --> 00:49:42.400 align:start position:0%
for certain school days i think that
 
00:49:43.670 --> 00:49:43.680 align:start position:0%
would be a prime example of when an
 
00:49:44.870 --> 00:49:44.880 align:start position:0%
exemption would be needed on that
 
00:49:47.109 --> 00:49:47.119 align:start position:0%
saturday day um i think that is a very
 
00:49:49.910 --> 00:49:49.920 align:start position:0%
good point regarding early release
 
00:49:51.670 --> 00:49:51.680 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure what the current
 
00:49:52.710 --> 00:49:52.720 align:start position:0%
system is that the department of
 
00:49:54.950 --> 00:49:54.960 align:start position:0%
education does for addressing that issue
 
00:49:56.230 --> 00:49:56.240 align:start position:0%
or how school districts might address
 
00:49:57.910 --> 00:49:57.920 align:start position:0%
that situation if it's only them there's
 
00:49:59.349 --> 00:49:59.359 align:start position:0%
enabling legislation for that that's a
 
00:50:01.270 --> 00:50:01.280 align:start position:0%
good question for the department
 
00:50:02.790 --> 00:50:02.800 align:start position:0%
thank you very much are there further
 
00:50:04.069 --> 00:50:04.079 align:start position:0%
questions we have others who'd like to
 
00:50:05.750 --> 00:50:05.760 align:start position:0%
speak on this bill as well
 
00:50:07.750 --> 00:50:07.760 align:start position:0%

on the days that i'm not here
 
00:51:03.190 --> 00:51:03.200 align:start position:0%
i'm actually a substitute in the
 
00:51:05.750 --> 00:51:05.760 align:start position:0%
winchester school district
 
00:51:09.190 --> 00:51:09.200 align:start position:0%
on tuesdays i float to cover any special
 
00:51:10.950 --> 00:51:10.960 align:start position:0%
education meetings
 
00:51:12.710 --> 00:51:12.720 align:start position:0%
one particular day
 
00:51:15.349 --> 00:51:15.359 align:start position:0%
we were discussing how a bill actually
 
00:51:18.309 --> 00:51:18.319 align:start position:0%
becomes law with this particular class
 
00:51:20.950 --> 00:51:20.960 align:start position:0%
i was asked about bills of interest and
 
00:51:22.549 --> 00:51:22.559 align:start position:0%
i did remember about this particular
 
00:51:24.470 --> 00:51:24.480 align:start position:0%
lunch bill
 
00:51:25.829 --> 00:51:25.839 align:start position:0%
i would like to give credit to the
 
00:51:27.190 --> 00:51:27.200 align:start position:0%
representative for writing this bill
 
00:51:29.190 --> 00:51:29.200 align:start position:0%
because i can assure you that the entire
 
00:51:31.109 --> 00:51:31.119 align:start position:0%
school is watching this particular
 
00:51:35.670 --> 00:51:35.680 align:start position:0%
hearing and it has caused such a stir
 
00:51:51.510 --> 00:51:51.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:53.430 --> 00:51:53.440 align:start position:0%
carter thinks we should not do it
 
00:51:55.349 --> 00:51:55.359 align:start position:0%
because we will have a longer day and if
 
00:51:57.270 --> 00:51:57.280 align:start position:0%
we have practice for sports it will make
 
00:52:00.630 --> 00:52:00.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:02.829 --> 00:52:02.839 align:start position:0%
willow thinks this bill is a good
 
00:52:04.950 --> 00:52:04.960 align:start position:0%
idea i'm sorry
 
00:52:06.390 --> 00:52:06.400 align:start position:0%
she does not think this bill is a good
 
00:52:06.400 --> 00:52:08.150 align:start position:0%
she does not think this bill is a good
idea

00:52:08.150 --> 00:52:08.160 align:start position:0%
idea
 
00:52:11.109 --> 00:52:11.119 align:start position:0%
so forth about the sports and longer
 
00:52:13.990 --> 00:52:14.000 align:start position:0%
longer days of the year
 
00:52:15.510 --> 00:52:15.520 align:start position:0%
emma thinks we should have extended
 
00:52:17.270 --> 00:52:17.280 align:start position:0%
lunch times because
 
00:52:19.589 --> 00:52:19.599 align:start position:0%
because if you're at the end of the line
 
00:52:21.190 --> 00:52:21.200 align:start position:0%
you may only have about five minutes to
 
00:52:22.950 --> 00:52:22.960 align:start position:0%
eat your food
 
00:52:25.349 --> 00:52:25.359 align:start position:0%
grayson is in favor of this bill
 
00:52:26.950 --> 00:52:26.960 align:start position:0%
because he believes we need more time
 
00:52:28.710 --> 00:52:28.720 align:start position:0%
for lunch so we can eat all of our food
 
00:52:30.309 --> 00:52:30.319 align:start position:0%
so we won't starve
 
00:52:31.910 --> 00:52:31.920 align:start position:0%
also if the bill if the governor can
 
00:52:34.870 --> 00:52:34.880 align:start position:0%
hear this bill he wants it to be signed
 
00:52:36.549 --> 00:52:36.559 align:start position:0%
however i'm going to change my hat for a
 
00:52:37.750 --> 00:52:37.760 align:start position:0%
minute and i'm going to speak for the
 
00:52:41.030 --> 00:52:41.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:42.549 --> 00:52:42.559 align:start position:0%
the biggest question we have about this
 
00:52:44.069 --> 00:52:44.079 align:start position:0%
legislation is how is this going to be
 
00:52:45.750 --> 00:52:45.760 align:start position:0%
executed if the person at the beginning
 
00:52:47.670 --> 00:52:47.680 align:start position:0%
of the line
 
00:52:49.349 --> 00:52:49.359 align:start position:0%
is sitting for 20 minutes or what about
 
00:52:50.710 --> 00:52:50.720 align:start position:0%
the person at the end of the line when
 
00:52:52.549 --> 00:52:52.559 align:start position:0%
exactly is this 20 minutes supposed to
 
00:52:52.559 --> 00:52:53.990 align:start position:0%
exactly is this 20 minutes supposed to
start

00:52:53.990 --> 00:52:54.000 align:start position:0%
start
 
00:52:56.870 --> 00:52:56.880 align:start position:0%
furthermore in elementary school
 
00:52:58.710 --> 00:52:58.720 align:start position:0%
recess is considered educational
 
00:53:00.470 --> 00:53:00.480 align:start position:0%
instruction however in middle school in
 
00:53:02.230 --> 00:53:02.240 align:start position:0%
high school it is not
 
00:53:04.790 --> 00:53:04.800 align:start position:0%
therefore any time that you have to put
 
00:53:06.870 --> 00:53:06.880 align:start position:0%
for anything else you do have to extend
 
00:53:08.710 --> 00:53:08.720 align:start position:0%
your day in this case you wouldn't be
 
00:53:09.829 --> 00:53:09.839 align:start position:0%
able to extend your day you would
 
00:53:13.589 --> 00:53:13.599 align:start position:0%
actually have to extend the school year
 
00:53:13.599 --> 00:53:14.390 align:start position:0%
actually have to extend the school year
um

00:53:14.390 --> 00:53:14.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:53:16.230 --> 00:53:16.240 align:start position:0%
another point is
 
00:53:18.790 --> 00:53:18.800 align:start position:0%
reimbursable meals
 
00:53:20.470 --> 00:53:20.480 align:start position:0%
there's with the federal government
 
00:53:22.549 --> 00:53:22.559 align:start position:0%
there's offer versus serve
 
00:53:24.309 --> 00:53:24.319 align:start position:0%
so when a student goes to the lunch line
 
00:53:25.910 --> 00:53:25.920 align:start position:0%
they have to have a minimum of three
 
00:53:27.349 --> 00:53:27.359 align:start position:0%
things on their tray for to be
 
00:53:29.030 --> 00:53:29.040 align:start position:0%
considered reimbursable
 
00:53:30.950 --> 00:53:30.960 align:start position:0%
furthermore they can't just have a
 
00:53:33.030 --> 00:53:33.040 align:start position:0%
vegetable they have to have an option
 
00:53:35.030 --> 00:53:35.040 align:start position:0%
between a vegetable cooked or a
 
00:53:37.430 --> 00:53:37.440 align:start position:0%
vegetable raw if they have fruit they
 
00:53:38.790 --> 00:53:38.800 align:start position:0%
have to have an option are they going to
 
00:53:38.800 --> 00:53:39.589 align:start position:0%
have to have an option are they going to
have

00:53:39.589 --> 00:53:39.599 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:53:41.510 --> 00:53:41.520 align:start position:0%
an orange are they going to have actual
 
00:53:41.520 --> 00:53:42.790 align:start position:0%
an orange are they going to have actual
juice

00:53:42.790 --> 00:53:42.800 align:start position:0%
juice
 
00:53:44.950 --> 00:53:44.960 align:start position:0%
furthermore from when i was in school
 
00:53:47.190 --> 00:53:47.200 align:start position:0%
and i'm assuming most of you we have had
 
00:53:49.750 --> 00:53:49.760 align:start position:0%
what i call the nutrition evolution
 
00:53:51.750 --> 00:53:51.760 align:start position:0%
i remember the breakfast program coming
 
00:53:53.910 --> 00:53:53.920 align:start position:0%
out is a pilot program
 
00:53:56.309 --> 00:53:56.319 align:start position:0%
in a school that i substitute the
 
00:53:57.910 --> 00:53:57.920 align:start position:0%
students are offered breakfast whenever
 
00:54:00.069 --> 00:54:00.079 align:start position:0%
they walk in in the morning then around
 
00:54:02.069 --> 00:54:02.079 align:start position:0%
10 o'clock they're offered snack there's
 
00:54:03.430 --> 00:54:03.440 align:start position:0%
usually about three choices in the
 
00:54:05.349 --> 00:54:05.359 align:start position:0%
basket which is also delivered to their
 
00:54:07.510 --> 00:54:07.520 align:start position:0%
classrooms then they go to lunch and
 
00:54:09.190 --> 00:54:09.200 align:start position:0%
then after lunch they have another snack
 
00:54:10.630 --> 00:54:10.640 align:start position:0%
i can assure you these students are not
 
00:54:12.309 --> 00:54:12.319 align:start position:0%
going to starve by any stretch of the
 
00:54:12.319 --> 00:54:14.630 align:start position:0%
going to starve by any stretch of the
imagination

00:54:14.630 --> 00:54:14.640 align:start position:0%
imagination
 
00:54:18.470 --> 00:54:18.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:18.480 --> 00:54:19.190 align:start position:0%
 
the

00:54:19.190 --> 00:54:19.200 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:54:21.270 --> 00:54:21.280 align:start position:0%
the 11 to 2.
 
00:54:23.510 --> 00:54:23.520 align:start position:0%
currently our school is starting lunch
 
00:54:26.069 --> 00:54:26.079 align:start position:0%
at 10 45 normally it is 11 o'clock
 
00:54:27.910 --> 00:54:27.920 align:start position:0%
however this is a coveted problem this
 
00:54:29.670 --> 00:54:29.680 align:start position:0%
is not a lunch problem
 
00:54:31.109 --> 00:54:31.119 align:start position:0%
so we would ask if you're going to do
 
00:54:32.790 --> 00:54:32.800 align:start position:0%
anything please do not put any more
 
00:54:35.109 --> 00:54:35.119 align:start position:0%
shackles on the schools as far as their
 
00:54:36.390 --> 00:54:36.400 align:start position:0%
time frames
 
00:54:38.150 --> 00:54:38.160 align:start position:0%
only going to make it more difficult for
 
00:54:40.309 --> 00:54:40.319 align:start position:0%
the administration to have to
 
00:54:42.230 --> 00:54:42.240 align:start position:0%
i guess execute this bill
 
00:54:44.069 --> 00:54:44.079 align:start position:0%
so with that being said
 
00:54:45.910 --> 00:54:45.920 align:start position:0%
i do believe that the seventh graders in
 
00:54:47.270 --> 00:54:47.280 align:start position:0%
the administration of the winchester
 
00:54:48.470 --> 00:54:48.480 align:start position:0%
school district would ask do you find
 
00:54:50.230 --> 00:54:50.240 align:start position:0%
this bill in exceeding the legislate
 
00:54:51.910 --> 00:54:51.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for your time well thank you
 
00:54:54.230 --> 00:54:54.240 align:start position:0%
very much representative and we welcome
 
00:54:56.950 --> 00:54:56.960 align:start position:0%
the kids from winchester who hopefully
 
00:54:58.150 --> 00:54:58.160 align:start position:0%
are listening
 
00:55:00.309 --> 00:55:00.319 align:start position:0%
and getting an education and how things
 
00:55:01.990 --> 00:55:02.000 align:start position:0%
occur in their own state in terms of how
 
00:55:03.990 --> 00:55:04.000 align:start position:0%
a bill becomes a law
 
00:55:05.670 --> 00:55:05.680 align:start position:0%
uh are there any questions of the
 
00:55:05.680 --> 00:55:08.150 align:start position:0%
uh are there any questions of the
representative

00:55:08.150 --> 00:55:08.160 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:55:10.470 --> 00:55:10.480 align:start position:0%
not seeing in hands thank you very much
 
00:55:11.750 --> 00:55:11.760 align:start position:0%
thank you for your time all have a great
 
00:55:11.760 --> 00:55:17.030 align:start position:0%
thank you for your time all have a great
day

00:55:17.030 --> 00:55:17.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:18.789 --> 00:55:18.799 align:start position:0%
representative smith
 
00:55:20.630 --> 00:55:20.640 align:start position:0%
from hebrew
 
00:55:24.870 --> 00:55:24.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:27.030 --> 00:55:27.040 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and
 
00:55:41.750 --> 00:55:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:44.069 --> 00:55:44.079 align:start position:0%
it's for everybody because some of the
 
00:55:46.630 --> 00:55:46.640 align:start position:0%
questions seem to be if we pass this
 
00:55:48.309 --> 00:55:48.319 align:start position:0%
bill we're going to have to have longer
 
00:55:51.190 --> 00:55:51.200 align:start position:0%
lunch breaks and the school day will
 
00:55:55.910 --> 00:55:55.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:55.920 --> 00:55:57.270 align:start position:0%
 
the

00:55:57.270 --> 00:55:57.280 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:55:59.750 --> 00:55:59.760 align:start position:0%
the time it takes to go through the line
 
00:56:02.069 --> 00:56:02.079 align:start position:0%
the time it takes to pick your food all
 
00:56:04.789 --> 00:56:04.799 align:start position:0%
of those things add and take away from
 
00:56:06.870 --> 00:56:06.880 align:start position:0%
that 20 minute time that you are allowed
 
00:56:08.069 --> 00:56:08.079 align:start position:0%
to eat
 
00:56:09.270 --> 00:56:09.280 align:start position:0%
and both
 
00:56:09.280 --> 00:56:10.390 align:start position:0%
and both
the

00:56:10.390 --> 00:56:10.400 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:56:12.470 --> 00:56:12.480 align:start position:0%
american pediatric association and the
 
00:56:15.190 --> 00:56:15.200 align:start position:0%
cdc recommend that students have
 
00:56:17.670 --> 00:56:17.680 align:start position:0%
20 minutes to actually eat their lunch
 
00:56:20.150 --> 00:56:20.160 align:start position:0%
not 20 minutes including standing in
 
00:56:20.160 --> 00:56:22.150 align:start position:0%
not 20 minutes including standing in
line

00:56:22.150 --> 00:56:22.160 align:start position:0%
line
 
00:56:22.160 --> 00:56:23.109 align:start position:0%
line
i

00:56:23.109 --> 00:56:23.119 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:56:25.109 --> 00:56:25.119 align:start position:0%
spoke to a constituent about this who
 
00:56:28.150 --> 00:56:28.160 align:start position:0%
just went on and on about her son who
 
00:56:30.710 --> 00:56:30.720 align:start position:0%
did sports had to eat his lunch so
 
00:56:33.109 --> 00:56:33.119 align:start position:0%
quickly that by the time it came time to
 
00:56:35.670 --> 00:56:35.680 align:start position:0%
do his after-school activity she had to
 
00:56:37.349 --> 00:56:37.359 align:start position:0%
bring him another sandwich to eat
 
00:56:38.789 --> 00:56:38.799 align:start position:0%
because he just didn't get enough at
 
00:56:41.829 --> 00:56:41.839 align:start position:0%
lunch time the fourth graders at
 
00:56:43.990 --> 00:56:44.000 align:start position:0%
plymouth elementary school when they
 
00:56:46.309 --> 00:56:46.319 align:start position:0%
came to visit the state house they had a
 
00:56:48.230 --> 00:56:48.240 align:start position:0%
nice long discussion about this bill
 
00:56:50.309 --> 00:56:50.319 align:start position:0%
also and all but one were in favor of
 
00:56:51.670 --> 00:56:51.680 align:start position:0%
passing it
 
00:56:54.950 --> 00:56:54.960 align:start position:0%
i know when my daughter was in school
 
00:56:57.030 --> 00:56:57.040 align:start position:0%
her lunch she got on the bus at seven
 
00:56:59.829 --> 00:56:59.839 align:start position:0%
o'clock her lunch break was at 10 30 but
 
00:57:01.910 --> 00:57:01.920 align:start position:0%
she didn't get home until four
 
00:57:04.309 --> 00:57:04.319 align:start position:0%
so that whole period of time in between
 
00:57:06.470 --> 00:57:06.480 align:start position:0%
was a long break for kids to not be able
 
00:57:08.230 --> 00:57:08.240 align:start position:0%
to eat their lunch
 
00:57:10.710 --> 00:57:10.720 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:57:12.870 --> 00:57:12.880 align:start position:0%
the one of the recommendations from the
 
00:57:16.309 --> 00:57:16.319 align:start position:0%
cdc is having recess before lunch so the
 
00:57:19.750 --> 00:57:19.760 align:start position:0%
kids get some of that steam worked off
 
00:57:21.829 --> 00:57:21.839 align:start position:0%
and then when they go to sit down to eat
 
00:57:23.670 --> 00:57:23.680 align:start position:0%
they're a little more relaxed and able
 
00:57:25.430 --> 00:57:25.440 align:start position:0%
to enjoy their lunch
 
00:57:27.589 --> 00:57:27.599 align:start position:0%
as uh before i was a
 
00:57:29.829 --> 00:57:29.839 align:start position:0%
state rep i was all i've been a
 
00:57:31.510 --> 00:57:31.520 align:start position:0%
nutritionist for
 
00:57:33.349 --> 00:57:33.359 align:start position:0%
30 or 40 years
 
00:57:33.359 --> 00:57:34.630 align:start position:0%
30 or 40 years
and

00:57:34.630 --> 00:57:34.640 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:57:37.510 --> 00:57:37.520 align:start position:0%
children's diets in school
 
00:57:39.270 --> 00:57:39.280 align:start position:0%
leave a lot to be desired when they
 
00:57:42.390 --> 00:57:42.400 align:start position:0%
don't eat the fruit that is in the lunch
 
00:57:44.630 --> 00:57:44.640 align:start position:0%
on the lunch line but they just eat the
 
00:57:44.640 --> 00:57:45.910 align:start position:0%
on the lunch line but they just eat the
pizza

00:57:45.910 --> 00:57:45.920 align:start position:0%
pizza
 
00:57:45.920 --> 00:57:47.190 align:start position:0%
pizza
and

00:57:47.190 --> 00:57:47.200 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:57:49.750 --> 00:57:49.760 align:start position:0%
having a little extra time to eat
 
00:57:52.630 --> 00:57:52.640 align:start position:0%
enables them to get more nutrition out
 
00:57:54.549 --> 00:57:54.559 align:start position:0%
of their food which will help them
 
00:57:56.950 --> 00:57:56.960 align:start position:0%
overall in their studies
 
00:57:58.150 --> 00:57:58.160 align:start position:0%
and in
 
00:58:01.109 --> 00:58:01.119 align:start position:0%
all the activities that they do
 
00:58:02.630 --> 00:58:02.640 align:start position:0%
i don't want to say any more
 
00:58:04.230 --> 00:58:04.240 align:start position:0%
representative deshay
 
00:58:06.950 --> 00:58:06.960 align:start position:0%
said it all i think but i do wanna i did
 
00:58:09.670 --> 00:58:09.680 align:start position:0%
bring handouts on uh ways to
 
00:58:11.589 --> 00:58:11.599 align:start position:0%
so students can have enough time to eat
 
00:58:11.599 --> 00:58:12.630 align:start position:0%
so students can have enough time to eat
lunch

00:58:12.630 --> 00:58:12.640 align:start position:0%
lunch
 
00:58:15.270 --> 00:58:15.280 align:start position:0%
and what is seat time are schools
 
00:58:17.190 --> 00:58:17.200 align:start position:0%
providing enough and this is a handout
 
00:58:18.710 --> 00:58:18.720 align:start position:0%
from the cdc
 
00:58:19.589 --> 00:58:19.599 align:start position:0%
and although they're a little
 
00:58:21.670 --> 00:58:21.680 align:start position:0%
controversial the american pediatric
 
00:58:23.750 --> 00:58:23.760 align:start position:0%
academy also agrees
 
00:58:25.910 --> 00:58:25.920 align:start position:0%
with the precept of this bill and i
 
00:58:28.309 --> 00:58:28.319 align:start position:0%
think when we get into the situation of
 
00:58:30.630 --> 00:58:30.640 align:start position:0%
what happens with when we let people out
 
00:58:33.430 --> 00:58:33.440 align:start position:0%
early or they come in late i think those
 
00:58:35.030 --> 00:58:35.040 align:start position:0%
are things schools deal with all the
 
00:58:36.870 --> 00:58:36.880 align:start position:0%
time it's not that we're asking for the
 
00:58:39.190 --> 00:58:39.200 align:start position:0%
lunch hour to be extended just that the
 
00:58:42.630 --> 00:58:42.640 align:start position:0%
time in that 20 minute 30 minutes
 
00:58:46.069 --> 00:58:46.079 align:start position:0%
20 minutes is allowed for eating and
 
00:58:47.829 --> 00:58:47.839 align:start position:0%
that means just streamlining some
 
00:58:49.750 --> 00:58:49.760 align:start position:0%
processes along the way
 
00:58:51.670 --> 00:58:51.680 align:start position:0%
i have one other comment nothing to do
 
00:58:53.670 --> 00:58:53.680 align:start position:0%
with the bill
 
00:58:55.510 --> 00:58:55.520 align:start position:0%
when the person is giving testimony
 
00:58:57.589 --> 00:58:57.599 align:start position:0%
speaks and has the red light on it goes
 
00:58:59.349 --> 00:58:59.359 align:start position:0%
out through the speaker so everyone can
 
00:59:01.829 --> 00:59:01.839 align:start position:0%
hear it but it appears that when they
 
00:59:04.470 --> 00:59:04.480 align:start position:0%
turn it off i couldn't hear anyone in
 
00:59:04.480 --> 00:59:05.589 align:start position:0%
turn it off i couldn't hear anyone in
the

00:59:05.589 --> 00:59:05.599 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:59:08.549 --> 00:59:08.559 align:start position:0%
on the committee so i think that their
 
00:59:11.349 --> 00:59:11.359 align:start position:0%
mics don't come through the speaker when
 
00:59:14.390 --> 00:59:14.400 align:start position:0%
this is turned off that's just my
 
00:59:16.230 --> 00:59:16.240 align:start position:0%
observation so i don't know you can
 
00:59:18.630 --> 00:59:18.640 align:start position:0%
figure it out but thank you and i can
 
00:59:20.549 --> 00:59:20.559 align:start position:0%
take any questions i don't know if it's
 
00:59:22.870 --> 00:59:22.880 align:start position:0%
a daisy chain of links i don't know i
 
00:59:24.390 --> 00:59:24.400 align:start position:0%
know it's really kind of crazy are there
 
00:59:27.990 --> 00:59:28.000 align:start position:0%
any uh questions for the speaker
 
00:59:29.589 --> 00:59:29.599 align:start position:0%
not seeing hands thank you very much
 
00:59:33.750 --> 00:59:33.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:36.549 --> 00:59:36.559 align:start position:0%

bill

01:00:13.109 --> 01:00:13.119 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:00:15.030 --> 01:00:15.040 align:start position:0%
1058 legislation that would add a
 
01:00:15.040 --> 01:00:16.230 align:start position:0%
1058 legislation that would add a
lunchtime

01:00:16.230 --> 01:00:16.240 align:start position:0%
lunchtime
 
01:00:17.829 --> 01:00:17.839 align:start position:0%
and seated meal time requirement for
 
01:00:20.230 --> 01:00:20.240 align:start position:0%
schools in new hampshire as educators we
 
01:00:21.990 --> 01:00:22.000 align:start position:0%
know that there are many factors that
 
01:00:23.829 --> 01:00:23.839 align:start position:0%
can negatively affect or i'm sorry
 
01:00:25.670 --> 01:00:25.680 align:start position:0%
influence a child's ability to learn and
 
01:00:28.549 --> 01:00:28.559 align:start position:0%
be productive at school including a lack
 
01:00:30.390 --> 01:00:30.400 align:start position:0%
of nutrition which leads to a lack of
 
01:00:32.150 --> 01:00:32.160 align:start position:0%
focus among other issues
 
01:00:34.069 --> 01:00:34.079 align:start position:0%
therefore not eating or not eating
 
01:00:35.349 --> 01:00:35.359 align:start position:0%
enough something we should seek to
 
01:00:36.789 --> 01:00:36.799 align:start position:0%
prevent in addition to improving the
 
01:00:38.230 --> 01:00:38.240 align:start position:0%
quality of food available to our
 
01:00:40.630 --> 01:00:40.640 align:start position:0%
students i can say
 
01:00:42.390 --> 01:00:42.400 align:start position:0%
my own three kids come home many times
 
01:00:43.750 --> 01:00:43.760 align:start position:0%
they're third grade fifth grade in ninth
 
01:00:45.670 --> 01:00:45.680 align:start position:0%
grade three boys um so they're eating
 
01:00:47.190 --> 01:00:47.200 align:start position:0%
every hour if they can
 
01:00:48.549 --> 01:00:48.559 align:start position:0%
but they're coming home constantly
 
01:00:49.990 --> 01:00:50.000 align:start position:0%
telling me there's not enough time to
 
01:00:52.230 --> 01:00:52.240 align:start position:0%
eat at lunch and to you know keep giving
 
01:00:54.309 --> 01:00:54.319 align:start position:0%
more food so they can have it
 
01:00:55.910 --> 01:00:55.920 align:start position:0%
recent study published in the journal of
 
01:00:57.990 --> 01:00:58.000 align:start position:0%
child nutrition and management indicated
 
01:00:59.670 --> 01:00:59.680 align:start position:0%
insufficient time is a key reason for
 
01:01:01.190 --> 01:01:01.200 align:start position:0%
not participating in the school lunch
 
01:01:01.200 --> 01:01:02.230 align:start position:0%
not participating in the school lunch
program

01:01:02.230 --> 01:01:02.240 align:start position:0%
program
 
01:01:05.109 --> 01:01:05.119 align:start position:0%
another study published in 2021 used a
 
01:01:07.349 --> 01:01:07.359 align:start position:0%
randomized clinical trial to study the
 
01:01:09.349 --> 01:01:09.359 align:start position:0%
effects of longer seeded lunchtime on
 
01:01:11.750 --> 01:01:11.760 align:start position:0%
food consumption and waste in elementary
 
01:01:13.589 --> 01:01:13.599 align:start position:0%
and middle school aged children
 
01:01:15.430 --> 01:01:15.440 align:start position:0%
the results showed that more eating time
 
01:01:17.109 --> 01:01:17.119 align:start position:0%
is associated with more consumption of
 
01:01:19.109 --> 01:01:19.119 align:start position:0%
fruits and vegetables in this crossover
 
01:01:22.150 --> 01:01:22.160 align:start position:0%
trial of 241 lunch observations from 38
 
01:01:22.160 --> 01:01:23.109 align:start position:0%
trial of 241 lunch observations from 38
children

01:01:23.109 --> 01:01:23.119 align:start position:0%
children
 
01:01:24.710 --> 01:01:24.720 align:start position:0%
20 minutes of seated lunch time were
 
01:01:26.390 --> 01:01:26.400 align:start position:0%
associated with significantly more
 
01:01:28.710 --> 01:01:28.720 align:start position:0%
consumption and significantly less waste
 
01:01:30.230 --> 01:01:30.240 align:start position:0%
of fruits and vegetables compared with
 
01:01:32.630 --> 01:01:32.640 align:start position:0%
10 minutes of seeded lunch time
 
01:01:34.710 --> 01:01:34.720 align:start position:0%
research conducted at the harvard t chan
 
01:01:36.870 --> 01:01:36.880 align:start position:0%
school of public health confirms the
 
01:01:38.870 --> 01:01:38.880 align:start position:0%
intuition that increasing lunch length
 
01:01:40.549 --> 01:01:40.559 align:start position:0%
would boost consumption
 
01:01:42.150 --> 01:01:42.160 align:start position:0%
the study published in the journal of
 
01:01:44.230 --> 01:01:44.240 align:start position:0%
the academy of nutrition and dietetics
 
01:01:46.150 --> 01:01:46.160 align:start position:0%
concluded that students in rush lunch
 
01:01:49.109 --> 01:01:49.119 align:start position:0%
periods eat less of every meal component
 
01:01:50.870 --> 01:01:50.880 align:start position:0%
kids who are given less than 20 minutes
 
01:01:54.230 --> 01:01:54.240 align:start position:0%
to eat consume 13 less of their entree
 
01:01:56.390 --> 01:01:56.400 align:start position:0%
10 percent less of their milk 12 percent
 
01:01:58.230 --> 01:01:58.240 align:start position:0%
less of their vegetable compared with
 
01:02:00.630 --> 01:02:00.640 align:start position:0%
those who had at least 25 minutes
 
01:02:02.630 --> 01:02:02.640 align:start position:0%
consequently the study also found more
 
01:02:04.549 --> 01:02:04.559 align:start position:0%
food waste among kids who had less time
 
01:02:06.789 --> 01:02:06.799 align:start position:0%
to eat dr
 
01:02:08.870 --> 01:02:08.880 align:start position:0%
julia cohen stated as part of the study
 
01:02:10.789 --> 01:02:10.799 align:start position:0%
that research shows that children who
 
01:02:12.390 --> 01:02:12.400 align:start position:0%
eat healthier foods learn better and
 
01:02:14.630 --> 01:02:14.640 align:start position:0%
have fewer disciplinary issues
 
01:02:16.870 --> 01:02:16.880 align:start position:0%
in addition to the study cited here the
 
01:02:18.870 --> 01:02:18.880 align:start position:0%
american academy of pediatrics is also
 
01:02:20.230 --> 01:02:20.240 align:start position:0%
pushing for at least 20 minutes of
 
01:02:21.910 --> 01:02:21.920 align:start position:0%
seated time
 
01:02:23.589 --> 01:02:23.599 align:start position:0%
finally there's even evidence from one
 
01:02:25.349 --> 01:02:25.359 align:start position:0%
study published in the southern economic
 
01:02:27.750 --> 01:02:27.760 align:start position:0%
journal in 2014 that an increased lunch
 
01:02:29.430 --> 01:02:29.440 align:start position:0%
length reduces the probability a child
 
01:02:30.950 --> 01:02:30.960 align:start position:0%
is overweight
 
01:02:32.549 --> 01:02:32.559 align:start position:0%
our students have a tremendous number of
 
01:02:34.470 --> 01:02:34.480 align:start position:0%
environmental influences on their lives
 
01:02:35.910 --> 01:02:35.920 align:start position:0%
and one of the things we learned during
 
01:02:37.910 --> 01:02:37.920 align:start position:0%
a period of extended remote learning is
 
01:02:40.150 --> 01:02:40.160 align:start position:0%
that in-person school is a positive one
 
01:02:42.230 --> 01:02:42.240 align:start position:0%
however being back at school does not
 
01:02:43.910 --> 01:02:43.920 align:start position:0%
leave behind all the challenges kids
 
01:02:45.829 --> 01:02:45.839 align:start position:0%
face these days we can help ensure the
 
01:02:47.910 --> 01:02:47.920 align:start position:0%
lack of an inadequate meal time and all
 
01:02:49.589 --> 01:02:49.599 align:start position:0%
the effects that come with it not be a
 
01:02:51.109 --> 01:02:51.119 align:start position:0%
factor that's inhibiting our kids from
 
01:02:52.390 --> 01:02:52.400 align:start position:0%
learning in the classroom and being
 
01:02:52.400 --> 01:02:53.430 align:start position:0%
learning in the classroom and being
healthy

01:02:53.430 --> 01:02:53.440 align:start position:0%
healthy
 
01:02:54.789 --> 01:02:54.799 align:start position:0%
i asked the committee take a step
 
01:02:56.309 --> 01:02:56.319 align:start position:0%
forward for our students on this
 
01:02:59.029 --> 01:02:59.039 align:start position:0%
important issue and find house bill 1058
 
01:03:00.230 --> 01:03:00.240 align:start position:0%
ought to pass
 
01:03:02.630 --> 01:03:02.640 align:start position:0%
thank you and i will take any questions
 
01:03:04.150 --> 01:03:04.160 align:start position:0%
uh thank you and if you have written
 
01:03:05.910 --> 01:03:05.920 align:start position:0%
testimony maybe you could pass that up
 
01:03:07.910 --> 01:03:07.920 align:start position:0%
to our clerk thank you any questions
 
01:03:10.470 --> 01:03:10.480 align:start position:0%
from the committee
 
01:03:13.349 --> 01:03:13.359 align:start position:0%
scene none thank you very much thank you
 
01:03:16.470 --> 01:03:16.480 align:start position:0%
and i believe our final uh speaker for
 
01:03:31.510 --> 01:03:31.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:32.630 --> 01:03:32.640 align:start position:0%
good morning
 
01:03:34.309 --> 01:03:34.319 align:start position:0%
for the record my name is nancy vaughn
 
01:03:35.910 --> 01:03:35.920 align:start position:0%
government relations director for the
 
01:03:37.270 --> 01:03:37.280 align:start position:0%
american heart association in new
 
01:03:39.750 --> 01:03:39.760 align:start position:0%
hampshire and thank you very much for
 
01:03:41.109 --> 01:03:41.119 align:start position:0%
taking the time
 
01:03:43.589 --> 01:03:43.599 align:start position:0%
to not only hear testimony on this
 
01:03:45.750 --> 01:03:45.760 align:start position:0%
important bill but also the questions
 
01:03:47.750 --> 01:03:47.760 align:start position:0%
that you are asking
 
01:03:49.430 --> 01:03:49.440 align:start position:0%
so the american heart association does
 
01:03:52.630 --> 01:03:52.640 align:start position:0%
support this bill and we do urge that
 
01:03:55.510 --> 01:03:55.520 align:start position:0%
that you pass it
 
01:03:58.230 --> 01:03:58.240 align:start position:0%
basically we do believe that expanding
 
01:04:00.069 --> 01:04:00.079 align:start position:0%
on the amount of time children have to
 
01:04:02.470 --> 01:04:02.480 align:start position:0%
eat their their lunch meal
 
01:04:04.549 --> 01:04:04.559 align:start position:0%
is something that's very important for
 
01:04:07.190 --> 01:04:07.200 align:start position:0%
children to um to
 
01:04:09.829 --> 01:04:09.839 align:start position:0%
take in the nutrition that they need and
 
01:04:11.670 --> 01:04:11.680 align:start position:0%
and perform academically to that at
 
01:04:14.870 --> 01:04:14.880 align:start position:0%
their highest standard one comment that
 
01:04:17.029 --> 01:04:17.039 align:start position:0%
wasn't necessarily made by others that i
 
01:04:17.039 --> 01:04:18.870 align:start position:0%
wasn't necessarily made by others that i
will

01:04:18.870 --> 01:04:18.880 align:start position:0%
will
 
01:04:21.349 --> 01:04:21.359 align:start position:0%
give us a verbal testimony students from
 
01:04:23.750 --> 01:04:23.760 align:start position:0%
families with low income receive more of
 
01:04:26.230 --> 01:04:26.240 align:start position:0%
their food and nutrition intake from
 
01:04:27.750 --> 01:04:27.760 align:start position:0%
school meals
 
01:04:29.910 --> 01:04:29.920 align:start position:0%
when they don't have time to eat
 
01:04:31.829 --> 01:04:31.839 align:start position:0%
and particularly the the time it takes
 
01:04:33.990 --> 01:04:34.000 align:start position:0%
to chew fresh fruits and vegetables that
 
01:04:36.710 --> 01:04:36.720 align:start position:0%
we really prefer them to be choosing
 
01:04:38.870 --> 01:04:38.880 align:start position:0%
that they will be missing out on these
 
01:04:40.870 --> 01:04:40.880 align:start position:0%
important nutrients perhaps for the
 
01:04:43.589 --> 01:04:43.599 align:start position:0%
entire day if most of their nutrients do
 
01:04:45.589 --> 01:04:45.599 align:start position:0%
come from from school lunch
 
01:04:47.670 --> 01:04:47.680 align:start position:0%
and or school breakfast
 
01:04:50.710 --> 01:04:50.720 align:start position:0%
and again there is science that children
 
01:04:50.720 --> 01:04:51.510 align:start position:0%
and again there is science that children
who

01:04:51.510 --> 01:04:51.520 align:start position:0%
who
 
01:04:53.589 --> 01:04:53.599 align:start position:0%
who eat more nutritious diets tend to
 
01:04:55.589 --> 01:04:55.599 align:start position:0%
perform better academically so in
 
01:04:57.750 --> 01:04:57.760 align:start position:0%
addition to the other testimony that was
 
01:04:59.349 --> 01:04:59.359 align:start position:0%
given today that is in my written
 
01:05:02.230 --> 01:05:02.240 align:start position:0%
testimony i will conclude and if you do
 
01:05:04.230 --> 01:05:04.240 align:start position:0%
have any questions i'm happy to try to
 
01:05:06.630 --> 01:05:06.640 align:start position:0%
answer them
 
01:05:09.990 --> 01:05:10.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:12.150 --> 01:05:12.160 align:start position:0%
scene none thank you very much thank you
 
01:05:14.710 --> 01:05:14.720 align:start position:0%
and i was mistaken we do have one more
 
01:05:25.910 --> 01:05:25.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:28.309 --> 01:05:28.319 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman not your fault my
 
01:05:32.150 --> 01:05:32.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:33.750 --> 01:05:33.760 align:start position:0%
for the record my name is jerry fruit
 
01:05:35.829 --> 01:05:35.839 align:start position:0%
i'm the associate executive director for
 
01:05:37.270 --> 01:05:37.280 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire school administrators
 
01:05:37.280 --> 01:05:40.390 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire school administrators
association

01:05:40.390 --> 01:05:40.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:42.390 --> 01:05:42.400 align:start position:0%
happy new year it's my first appearance
 
01:05:44.870 --> 01:05:44.880 align:start position:0%
before the committee won't be my last i
 
01:05:46.950 --> 01:05:46.960 align:start position:0%
can pretty much guarantee that so
 
01:05:49.430 --> 01:05:49.440 align:start position:0%
i will be brief
 
01:05:52.069 --> 01:05:52.079 align:start position:0%
representative cornell appreciate your
 
01:05:54.630 --> 01:05:54.640 align:start position:0%
and can relate to your experience in
 
01:05:56.549 --> 01:05:56.559 align:start position:0%
middle school cafeterias as an assistant
 
01:05:58.950 --> 01:05:58.960 align:start position:0%
principal and principal for 14 years
 
01:05:58.960 --> 01:06:00.069 align:start position:0%
principal and principal for 14 years
um

01:06:00.069 --> 01:06:00.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:06:03.109 --> 01:06:03.119 align:start position:0%
yeah 20 minutes can seem like a lifetime
 
01:06:05.270 --> 01:06:05.280 align:start position:0%
uh and representative baum i appreciate
 
01:06:05.280 --> 01:06:06.470 align:start position:0%
uh and representative baum i appreciate
your

01:06:06.470 --> 01:06:06.480 align:start position:0%
your
 
01:06:09.029 --> 01:06:09.039 align:start position:0%
concerns as well as as a systems leader
 
01:06:11.190 --> 01:06:11.200 align:start position:0%
and person who helped negotiate
 
01:06:12.549 --> 01:06:12.559 align:start position:0%
collective bargaining agreements and
 
01:06:15.190 --> 01:06:15.200 align:start position:0%
guaranteeing lunch time for staff and
 
01:06:17.750 --> 01:06:17.760 align:start position:0%
working conditions for cafeteria workers
 
01:06:20.390 --> 01:06:20.400 align:start position:0%
can appreciate your concern about
 
01:06:22.150 --> 01:06:22.160 align:start position:0%
the financial potential financial
 
01:06:24.150 --> 01:06:24.160 align:start position:0%
ramifications of this through collective
 
01:06:24.160 --> 01:06:25.430 align:start position:0%
ramifications of this through collective
bargaining

01:06:25.430 --> 01:06:25.440 align:start position:0%
bargaining
 
01:06:28.470 --> 01:06:28.480 align:start position:0%
and certainly appreciate the sponsors
 
01:06:31.910 --> 01:06:31.920 align:start position:0%
for bringing this issue forward
 
01:06:33.270 --> 01:06:33.280 align:start position:0%
being opposed to something like this
 
01:06:35.109 --> 01:06:35.119 align:start position:0%
would be akin to being opposed to apple
 
01:06:36.630 --> 01:06:36.640 align:start position:0%
pie and motherhood so we're not going to
 
01:06:38.870 --> 01:06:38.880 align:start position:0%
oppose this
 
01:06:40.710 --> 01:06:40.720 align:start position:0%
but we are concerned with a couple of
 
01:06:40.720 --> 01:06:41.829 align:start position:0%
but we are concerned with a couple of
factors

01:06:41.829 --> 01:06:41.839 align:start position:0%
factors
 
01:06:44.549 --> 01:06:44.559 align:start position:0%
the time frame involved of 11 o'clock to
 
01:06:44.559 --> 01:06:45.349 align:start position:0%
the time frame involved of 11 o'clock to
2

01:06:45.349 --> 01:06:45.359 align:start position:0%
2
 
01:06:45.359 --> 01:06:46.549 align:start position:0%
2
is

01:06:46.549 --> 01:06:46.559 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:06:48.309 --> 01:06:48.319 align:start position:0%
a little problematic and we appreciate
 
01:06:50.630 --> 01:06:50.640 align:start position:0%
the sponsor's willingness to perhaps
 
01:06:52.789 --> 01:06:52.799 align:start position:0%
entertain an amendment to adjust that i
 
01:06:55.190 --> 01:06:55.200 align:start position:0%
did a very quick unscientific poll of
 
01:06:56.789 --> 01:06:56.799 align:start position:0%
some of our members
 
01:06:58.230 --> 01:06:58.240 align:start position:0%
at a meeting recently there were about
 
01:07:00.390 --> 01:07:00.400 align:start position:0%
20 members in the room and i asked how
 
01:07:00.400 --> 01:07:01.589 align:start position:0%
20 members in the room and i asked how
many

01:07:01.589 --> 01:07:01.599 align:start position:0%
many
 
01:07:03.670 --> 01:07:03.680 align:start position:0%
districts would be impacted by
 
01:07:06.069 --> 01:07:06.079 align:start position:0%
this time frame of 11 o'clock to 2
 
01:07:07.829 --> 01:07:07.839 align:start position:0%
o'clock and over half of the hands in
 
01:07:10.630 --> 01:07:10.640 align:start position:0%
the room went up so there was a concern
 
01:07:10.640 --> 01:07:11.589 align:start position:0%
the room went up so there was a concern
that

01:07:11.589 --> 01:07:11.599 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:07:12.870 --> 01:07:12.880 align:start position:0%
school schedules would have to be
 
01:07:15.829 --> 01:07:15.839 align:start position:0%
adjusted therein brings my our second
 
01:07:15.839 --> 01:07:17.270 align:start position:0%
adjusted therein brings my our second
concern

01:07:17.270 --> 01:07:17.280 align:start position:0%
concern
 
01:07:19.109 --> 01:07:19.119 align:start position:0%
by the time this legislation makes it
 
01:07:20.710 --> 01:07:20.720 align:start position:0%
through the process
 
01:07:20.720 --> 01:07:21.990 align:start position:0%
through the process
and

01:07:21.990 --> 01:07:22.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:07:26.390 --> 01:07:26.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:28.710 --> 01:07:28.720 align:start position:0%
we would have concerns about
 
01:07:32.549 --> 01:07:32.559 align:start position:0%
the implementation timeline of it being
 
01:07:35.750 --> 01:07:35.760 align:start position:0%
put into effect for next year
 
01:07:37.670 --> 01:07:37.680 align:start position:0%
school schedules will be developed by
 
01:07:37.680 --> 01:07:38.950 align:start position:0%
school schedules will be developed by
mid-may

01:07:38.950 --> 01:07:38.960 align:start position:0%
mid-may
 
01:07:40.829 --> 01:07:40.839 align:start position:0%
student schedules will be developed by
 
01:07:43.670 --> 01:07:43.680 align:start position:0%
mid-may school budgets for next year are
 
01:07:45.270 --> 01:07:45.280 align:start position:0%
basically in the process of final
 
01:07:46.789 --> 01:07:46.799 align:start position:0%
approval now
 
01:07:49.190 --> 01:07:49.200 align:start position:0%
so we would respectfully request that
 
01:07:50.950 --> 01:07:50.960 align:start position:0%
should this
 
01:07:53.190 --> 01:07:53.200 align:start position:0%
move forward that the timeline be
 
01:07:55.029 --> 01:07:55.039 align:start position:0%
extended so that school districts
 
01:07:56.710 --> 01:07:56.720 align:start position:0%
because local school districts will be
 
01:07:56.720 --> 01:07:57.910 align:start position:0%
because local school districts will be
impacted

01:07:57.910 --> 01:07:57.920 align:start position:0%
impacted
 
01:07:59.750 --> 01:07:59.760 align:start position:0%
through student schedules
 
01:08:01.510 --> 01:08:01.520 align:start position:0%
through fiscal impact
 
01:08:03.190 --> 01:08:03.200 align:start position:0%
through potentially bus schedules and
 
01:08:04.870 --> 01:08:04.880 align:start position:0%
length of school day
 
01:08:07.589 --> 01:08:07.599 align:start position:0%
we would need some runway time to in
 
01:08:10.950 --> 01:08:10.960 align:start position:0%
each local district to be able to
 
01:08:13.829 --> 01:08:13.839 align:start position:0%
implement this very well intended
 
01:08:15.910 --> 01:08:15.920 align:start position:0%
student-centered piece of legislation
 
01:08:18.630 --> 01:08:18.640 align:start position:0%
which obviously we feel
 
01:08:19.910 --> 01:08:19.920 align:start position:0%
is in
 
01:08:21.910 --> 01:08:21.920 align:start position:0%
the best interest of children
 
01:08:21.920 --> 01:08:22.870 align:start position:0%
the best interest of children
so

01:08:22.870 --> 01:08:22.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:08:25.349 --> 01:08:25.359 align:start position:0%
with that
 
01:08:26.550 --> 01:08:26.560 align:start position:0%
i will stop
 
01:08:29.910 --> 01:08:29.920 align:start position:0%
and be happy to address any questions
 
01:08:31.030 --> 01:08:31.040 align:start position:0%
thank you for
 
01:08:32.950 --> 01:08:32.960 align:start position:0%
your first appearance
 
01:08:32.960 --> 01:08:33.829 align:start position:0%
your first appearance
um

01:08:33.829 --> 01:08:33.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:08:37.990 --> 01:08:38.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:42.390 --> 01:08:42.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:44.229 --> 01:08:44.239 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
01:08:46.630 --> 01:08:46.640 align:start position:0%
thank you sir for taking our questions
 
01:08:46.640 --> 01:08:47.990 align:start position:0%
thank you sir for taking our questions
um

01:08:47.990 --> 01:08:48.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:08:50.709 --> 01:08:50.719 align:start position:0%
do i understand you correctly that it
 
01:08:53.910 --> 01:08:53.920 align:start position:0%
might be preferable to have in this bill
 
01:08:55.749 --> 01:08:55.759 align:start position:0%
a time
 
01:08:55.759 --> 01:08:57.189 align:start position:0%
a time
component

01:08:57.189 --> 01:08:57.199 align:start position:0%
component
 
01:08:58.950 --> 01:08:58.960 align:start position:0%
that is flexible so it wouldn't
 
01:09:01.349 --> 01:09:01.359 align:start position:0%
necessarily have to be
 
01:09:03.910 --> 01:09:03.920 align:start position:0%
11 to 2 or something like that it could
 
01:09:03.920 --> 01:09:04.709 align:start position:0%
11 to 2 or something like that it could
be

01:09:04.709 --> 01:09:04.719 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:09:06.390 --> 01:09:06.400 align:start position:0%
10 15 to
 
01:09:09.110 --> 01:09:09.120 align:start position:0%
some short but a two-hour time frame
 
01:09:11.430 --> 01:09:11.440 align:start position:0%
would that satisfy
 
01:09:13.510 --> 01:09:13.520 align:start position:0%
the needs that you were hearing from
 
01:09:16.070 --> 01:09:16.080 align:start position:0%
your various uh colleagues thank you for
 
01:09:17.749 --> 01:09:17.759 align:start position:0%
your for your question representative
 
01:09:19.669 --> 01:09:19.679 align:start position:0%
ford uh and i believe it was
 
01:09:22.070 --> 01:09:22.080 align:start position:0%
representative baum that alluded to the
 
01:09:24.470 --> 01:09:24.480 align:start position:0%
space issues involved too and being able
 
01:09:25.829 --> 01:09:25.839 align:start position:0%
to service
 
01:09:27.829 --> 01:09:27.839 align:start position:0%
students in a
 
01:09:29.749 --> 01:09:29.759 align:start position:0%
you know some schools a number of them
 
01:09:32.390 --> 01:09:32.400 align:start position:0%
in this state have a multi-purpose room
 
01:09:34.229 --> 01:09:34.239 align:start position:0%
where they serve school lunch and they
 
01:09:37.430 --> 01:09:37.440 align:start position:0%
also conduct physical education classes
 
01:09:37.440 --> 01:09:38.789 align:start position:0%
also conduct physical education classes
and

01:09:38.789 --> 01:09:38.799 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:09:40.630 --> 01:09:40.640 align:start position:0%
if i'm not mistaken it may be later on
 
01:09:42.229 --> 01:09:42.239 align:start position:0%
this afternoon that this committee is
 
01:09:43.910 --> 01:09:43.920 align:start position:0%
going to hear something about extended
 
01:09:48.070 --> 01:09:48.080 align:start position:0%
physical education classes uh
 
01:09:49.430 --> 01:09:49.440 align:start position:0%
i will speak with you at one o'clock
 
01:09:51.669 --> 01:09:51.679 align:start position:0%
about all of those things
 
01:09:51.679 --> 01:09:52.550 align:start position:0%
about all of those things
um

01:09:52.550 --> 01:09:52.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:09:53.669 --> 01:09:53.679 align:start position:0%
but uh
 
01:09:55.750 --> 01:09:55.760 align:start position:0%
yes i think um
 
01:09:57.590 --> 01:09:57.600 align:start position:0%
schools need flexibility to implement
 
01:09:59.189 --> 01:09:59.199 align:start position:0%
anything like this because it's again

that people

compared to compared north american

01:20:46.790 --> 01:20:46.800 align:start position:0%
in a statement

01:20:50.800 --> 01:20:51.830 align:start position:0%
 
made

made

01:20:57.510 --> 01:20:57.520 align:start position:0%
it's worth noting
 
01:20:59.750 --> 01:20:59.760 align:start position:0%
that there is no comparison between
 
01:21:01.830 --> 01:21:01.840 align:start position:0%
notre dame's nickname
 
01:21:03.750 --> 01:21:03.760 align:start position:0%
and mascot
 
01:21:05.910 --> 01:21:05.920 align:start position:0%
and the indian and warrior names in
 
01:21:08.870 --> 01:21:08.880 align:start position:0%
mascots used by other institutions
 
01:21:11.830 --> 01:21:11.840 align:start position:0%
such as the nfl team formerly known as
 
01:21:14.149 --> 01:21:14.159 align:start position:0%
the redskins
 
01:21:17.110 --> 01:21:17.120 align:start position:0%
the state's statement also noted
 
01:21:19.510 --> 01:21:19.520 align:start position:0%
none of these institutions
 
01:21:22.390 --> 01:21:22.400 align:start position:0%
were founded or named
 
01:21:24.950 --> 01:21:24.960 align:start position:0%
by native americans who sought to
 
01:21:27.669 --> 01:21:27.679 align:start position:0%
highlight their heritage by using names
 
01:21:29.110 --> 01:21:29.120 align:start position:0%
and symbols
 
01:21:40.310 --> 01:21:40.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:43.669 --> 01:21:43.679 align:start position:0%
this morning when i was getting dressed
 
01:21:48.149 --> 01:21:48.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:49.510 --> 01:21:49.520 align:start position:0%
and i saw
 
01:21:52.550 --> 01:21:52.560 align:start position:0%
a sweater i'd worn for many years
 
01:21:54.830 --> 01:21:54.840 align:start position:0%
a white sweater and it was it was
 
01:21:57.990 --> 01:21:58.000 align:start position:0%
really a wonderful sweater
 
01:21:59.750 --> 01:21:59.760 align:start position:0%
back then
 
01:22:02.470 --> 01:22:02.480 align:start position:0%
but as i looked at it today
 
01:22:04.870 --> 01:22:04.880 align:start position:0%
it was worn and tattered
 
01:22:07.110 --> 01:22:07.120 align:start position:0%
it was something i would not wear in
 
01:22:07.120 --> 01:22:08.390 align:start position:0%
it was something i would not wear in
public

01:22:08.390 --> 01:22:08.400 align:start position:0%
public
 
01:22:10.310 --> 01:22:10.320 align:start position:0%
because it didn't apply it's not
 
01:22:12.310 --> 01:22:12.320 align:start position:0%
something i could wear here
 
01:22:15.430 --> 01:22:15.440 align:start position:0%
and the reason i mention this is because
 
01:22:18.709 --> 01:22:18.719 align:start position:0%
many of the mascots that we have today
 
01:22:20.950 --> 01:22:20.960 align:start position:0%
are old and outdated
 
01:22:23.669 --> 01:22:23.679 align:start position:0%
the message is not something that people
 
01:22:25.910 --> 01:22:25.920 align:start position:0%
want to share in public and are and are
 
01:22:28.229 --> 01:22:28.239 align:start position:0%
embarrassing to the native americans in
 
01:22:30.310 --> 01:22:30.320 align:start position:0%
our communities
 
01:22:32.390 --> 01:22:32.400 align:start position:0%
so they don't wear it
 
01:22:34.790 --> 01:22:34.800 align:start position:0%
just as i'm not wearing that sweater
 
01:22:40.149 --> 01:22:40.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:42.629 --> 01:22:42.639 align:start position:0%
over the past two years
 
01:22:45.270 --> 01:22:45.280 align:start position:0%
we here in the legislature
 
01:22:47.350 --> 01:22:47.360 align:start position:0%
enacted legislation
 
01:22:50.830 --> 01:22:50.840 align:start position:0%
to encourage us all to treat each other
 
01:22:53.990 --> 01:22:54.000 align:start position:0%
respectfully as equals
 
01:22:55.669 --> 01:22:55.679 align:start position:0%
this is one of the reasons why i'm
 
01:22:58.790 --> 01:22:58.800 align:start position:0%
bringing this legislation forward
 
01:23:01.110 --> 01:23:01.120 align:start position:0%
we need to treat
 
01:23:03.910 --> 01:23:03.920 align:start position:0%
our native american brothers and sisters
 
01:23:03.920 --> 01:23:04.830 align:start position:0%
our native american brothers and sisters
with

01:23:04.830 --> 01:23:04.840 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:23:08.070 --> 01:23:08.080 align:start position:0%
respect and as equals
 
01:23:10.070 --> 01:23:10.080 align:start position:0%
we need to let
 
01:23:12.229 --> 01:23:12.239 align:start position:0%
all of our children
 
01:23:14.629 --> 01:23:14.639 align:start position:0%
learn in an environment that accepts
 
01:23:14.639 --> 01:23:15.510 align:start position:0%
learn in an environment that accepts
them

01:23:15.510 --> 01:23:15.520 align:start position:0%
them
 
01:23:17.590 --> 01:23:17.600 align:start position:0%
for who they are today
 
01:23:22.149 --> 01:23:22.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:23.750 --> 01:23:23.760 align:start position:0%
i urge you
 
01:23:26.550 --> 01:23:26.560 align:start position:0%
to vote ought to pass
 
01:23:28.629 --> 01:23:28.639 align:start position:0%
to save the lives
 
01:23:31.350 --> 01:23:31.360 align:start position:0%
of native american
 
01:23:34.550 --> 01:23:34.560 align:start position:0%
youth in our state
 
01:23:36.229 --> 01:23:36.239 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:23:37.669 --> 01:23:37.679 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
01:23:39.510 --> 01:23:39.520 align:start position:0%
uh are there any questions
 
01:23:41.830 --> 01:23:41.840 align:start position:0%
uh representative baum
 
01:23:42.950 --> 01:23:42.960 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
01:23:44.790 --> 01:23:44.800 align:start position:0%
taking the question
 
01:23:46.390 --> 01:23:46.400 align:start position:0%
i agree with this but what about other
 
01:23:46.400 --> 01:23:48.070 align:start position:0%
i agree with this but what about other
ethnics

01:23:48.070 --> 01:23:48.080 align:start position:0%
ethnics
 
01:23:49.830 --> 01:23:49.840 align:start position:0%
i mean shouldn't this be covering
 
01:23:52.470 --> 01:23:52.480 align:start position:0%
everybody like you had said all need to
 
01:24:00.830 --> 01:24:00.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:03.110 --> 01:24:03.120 align:start position:0%
school changed their name because it
 
01:24:04.629 --> 01:24:04.639 align:start position:0%
wasn't right
 
01:24:04.639 --> 01:24:05.590 align:start position:0%
wasn't right
the

01:24:05.590 --> 01:24:05.600 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:24:08.070 --> 01:24:08.080 align:start position:0%
florida state seminoles they're called
 
01:24:10.070 --> 01:24:10.080 align:start position:0%
seminoles because the name is licensed
 
01:24:12.229 --> 01:24:12.239 align:start position:0%
by the seven-year-old tribe
 
01:24:14.870 --> 01:24:14.880 align:start position:0%
so should that be changed so my concern
 
01:24:19.270 --> 01:24:19.280 align:start position:0%
is other ethics are also good to see for
 
01:24:22.149 --> 01:24:22.159 align:start position:0%
example vikings i mean that's the same
 
01:24:23.189 --> 01:24:23.199 align:start position:0%
type of
 
01:24:24.629 --> 01:24:24.639 align:start position:0%
situation so
 
01:24:26.870 --> 01:24:26.880 align:start position:0%
what about everybody
 
01:24:28.709 --> 01:24:28.719 align:start position:0%
well in the case i'll take them
 
01:24:30.950 --> 01:24:30.960 align:start position:0%
specifically in the seminoles and some
 
01:24:32.709 --> 01:24:32.719 align:start position:0%
other members which may do the same
 
01:24:35.189 --> 01:24:35.199 align:start position:0%
thing seminose is a very large native
 
01:24:38.070 --> 01:24:38.080 align:start position:0%
american organization in florida and
 
01:24:39.669 --> 01:24:39.679 align:start position:0%
they do have
 
01:24:39.679 --> 01:24:40.870 align:start position:0%
they do have
schools

01:24:40.870 --> 01:24:40.880 align:start position:0%
schools
 
01:24:43.270 --> 01:24:43.280 align:start position:0%
that have educational programs to
 
01:24:45.830 --> 01:24:45.840 align:start position:0%
educate the students in those schools so
 
01:24:48.149 --> 01:24:48.159 align:start position:0%
their use of
 
01:24:50.149 --> 01:24:50.159 align:start position:0%
of logos and names
 
01:24:52.390 --> 01:24:52.400 align:start position:0%
is appropriate the same thing happens in
 
01:24:55.189 --> 01:24:55.199 align:start position:0%
colorado and other states and there's

names they are
 
01:25:17.430 --> 01:25:17.440 align:start position:0%
a generalization of
 
01:25:20.070 --> 01:25:20.080 align:start position:0%
organizations that we don't necessarily
 
01:25:23.830 --> 01:25:23.840 align:start position:0%
use today there's no patriots tribe
 
01:25:27.110 --> 01:25:27.120 align:start position:0%
there are no vikings tribes

thank you mr chair and thank you
 
01:26:50.229 --> 01:26:50.239 align:start position:0%
representative for taking this question
 
01:26:51.990 --> 01:26:52.000 align:start position:0%
do you know how many schools or
 
01:26:55.110 --> 01:26:55.120 align:start position:0%
organizations in the state currently use
 
01:26:58.550 --> 01:26:58.560 align:start position:0%
native american images or
 
01:27:01.270 --> 01:27:01.280 align:start position:0%
for mascots i've been made aware of
 
01:27:01.280 --> 01:27:02.709 align:start position:0%
for mascots i've been made aware of
eight

01:27:02.709 --> 01:27:02.719 align:start position:0%
eight
 
01:27:05.430 --> 01:27:05.440 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:27:08.629 --> 01:27:08.639 align:start position:0%
any further questions uh represent likus
 
01:27:10.310 --> 01:27:10.320 align:start position:0%
i am curious where you got your
 
01:27:12.550 --> 01:27:12.560 align:start position:0%
information that no schools taught about
 
01:27:14.709 --> 01:27:14.719 align:start position:0%
native american culture
 
01:27:16.870 --> 01:27:16.880 align:start position:0%
while i personally didn't go to school
 
01:27:19.669 --> 01:27:19.679 align:start position:0%
here i know when i went to school that
 
01:27:22.229 --> 01:27:22.239 align:start position:0%
was definitely part of
 
01:27:24.550 --> 01:27:24.560 align:start position:0%
history geography
 
01:27:28.390 --> 01:27:28.400 align:start position:0%
etc etc social studies basically
 
01:27:30.310 --> 01:27:30.320 align:start position:0%
and in most cases
 
01:27:32.709 --> 01:27:32.719 align:start position:0%
native americans are mentioned
 
01:27:35.669 --> 01:27:35.679 align:start position:0%
we don't have any in-depth programs or
 
01:27:37.990 --> 01:27:38.000 align:start position:0%
educational classes that talk about
 
01:27:40.550 --> 01:27:40.560 align:start position:0%
native americans specifically
 
01:27:42.550 --> 01:27:42.560 align:start position:0%
in our state
 
01:27:45.270 --> 01:27:45.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:53.189 --> 01:27:53.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:54.870 --> 01:27:54.880 align:start position:0%
i'm almost afraid of touching my
 
01:27:58.790 --> 01:27:58.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:01.830 --> 01:28:01.840 align:start position:0%
my background in this will perhaps not
 
01:28:03.990 --> 01:28:04.000 align:start position:0%
be surprising when i indicate that i
 
01:28:05.910 --> 01:28:05.920 align:start position:0%
very much support this
 
01:28:08.790 --> 01:28:08.800 align:start position:0%
because i was once made a relative of
 
01:28:11.189 --> 01:28:11.199 align:start position:0%
the in the lakota tradition
 
01:28:14.149 --> 01:28:14.159 align:start position:0%
uh in response for advocating exactly
 
01:28:16.229 --> 01:28:16.239 align:start position:0%
this kind of
 
01:28:19.830 --> 01:28:19.840 align:start position:0%
response as well as the inclusion of
 
01:28:22.470 --> 01:28:22.480 align:start position:0%
having people on faculties and on
 
01:28:24.790 --> 01:28:24.800 align:start position:0%
organizations and providing leadership
 
01:28:28.709 --> 01:28:28.719 align:start position:0%
that in the upper midwest
 
01:28:30.310 --> 01:28:30.320 align:start position:0%
one of the things though that i would
 
01:28:32.709 --> 01:28:32.719 align:start position:0%
ask that you consider following
 
01:28:35.110 --> 01:28:35.120 align:start position:0%
representative bone's statement is that
 
01:28:35.120 --> 01:28:36.229 align:start position:0%
representative bone's statement is that
perhaps

01:28:36.229 --> 01:28:36.239 align:start position:0%
perhaps
 
01:28:37.350 --> 01:28:37.360 align:start position:0%
we could
 
01:28:40.550 --> 01:28:40.560 align:start position:0%
allow the in doing this bill allow the
 
01:28:42.390 --> 01:28:42.400 align:start position:0%
native americans to provide the
 
01:28:42.400 --> 01:28:43.830 align:start position:0%
native americans to provide the
leadership

01:28:43.830 --> 01:28:43.840 align:start position:0%
leadership
 
01:28:46.390 --> 01:28:46.400 align:start position:0%
to go back to attacking all of those
 
01:28:47.830 --> 01:28:47.840 align:start position:0%
forms of
 
01:28:50.629 --> 01:28:50.639 align:start position:0%
ethnic slurs and denigrations i mean our
 
01:28:52.390 --> 01:28:52.400 align:start position:0%
language gives us our own history
 
01:28:54.470 --> 01:28:54.480 align:start position:0%
whether we like it or not
 
01:28:57.189 --> 01:28:57.199 align:start position:0%
do is anyone not understand what i mean
 
01:29:00.790 --> 01:29:00.800 align:start position:0%
when i say someone is a a a
 
01:29:00.800 --> 01:29:02.229 align:start position:0%
when i say someone is a a a
jew

01:29:02.229 --> 01:29:02.239 align:start position:0%
jew
 
01:29:03.910 --> 01:29:03.920 align:start position:0%
a chief
 
01:29:05.830 --> 01:29:05.840 align:start position:0%
all these things go on and on and on
 
01:29:07.830 --> 01:29:07.840 align:start position:0%
we've got them for almost every ethnic
 
01:29:09.750 --> 01:29:09.760 align:start position:0%
group that came here because they're a
 
01:29:12.229 --> 01:29:12.239 align:start position:0%
way of designating otherness not one of
 
01:29:12.239 --> 01:29:13.350 align:start position:0%
way of designating otherness not one of
us

01:29:13.350 --> 01:29:13.360 align:start position:0%
us
 
01:29:15.270 --> 01:29:15.280 align:start position:0%
and what you're advocating is saying
 
01:29:18.149 --> 01:29:18.159 align:start position:0%
we're all one of us right and not not
 
01:29:21.430 --> 01:29:21.440 align:start position:0%
not lincoln and our symbols and so forth
 
01:29:23.830 --> 01:29:23.840 align:start position:0%
we've pretty much gotten it to where
 
01:29:26.870 --> 01:29:26.880 align:start position:0%
it's not acceptable to use those words
 
01:29:28.950 --> 01:29:28.960 align:start position:0%
in our language excuse me representative
 
01:29:30.790 --> 01:29:30.800 align:start position:0%
ford do you have a question yes my
 
01:29:32.790 --> 01:29:32.800 align:start position:0%
question is isn't it
 
01:29:34.950 --> 01:29:34.960 align:start position:0%
about time or would you agree that it is
 
01:29:36.149 --> 01:29:36.159 align:start position:0%
about time
 
01:29:38.629 --> 01:29:38.639 align:start position:0%
to do this symbolically
 
01:29:40.149 --> 01:29:40.159 align:start position:0%
and that's why i brought this bill
 
01:29:42.229 --> 01:29:42.239 align:start position:0%
forward you will hear more discussion
 
01:29:44.629 --> 01:29:44.639 align:start position:0%
from other speakers after me
 
01:29:47.350 --> 01:29:47.360 align:start position:0%
and uh you will hear of the of the
 
01:29:49.270 --> 01:29:49.280 align:start position:0%
challenges they have faced especially
 
01:29:52.470 --> 01:29:52.480 align:start position:0%
with the language we use
 
01:29:55.990 --> 01:29:56.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:04.950 --> 01:30:04.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:05.990 --> 01:30:06.000 align:start position:0%
thank you miss chair and thank you
 
01:30:09.750 --> 01:30:09.760 align:start position:0%
representative canada for being here uh
 
01:30:11.830 --> 01:30:11.840 align:start position:0%
the fsu seminole
 
01:30:13.350 --> 01:30:13.360 align:start position:0%
issue i was going to bring up but
 
01:30:15.030 --> 01:30:15.040 align:start position:0%
representative baum did that and i
 
01:30:16.310 --> 01:30:16.320 align:start position:0%
thought you addressed it well my
 
01:30:16.320 --> 01:30:17.350 align:start position:0%
thought you addressed it well my
question

01:30:17.350 --> 01:30:17.360 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:30:17.360 --> 01:30:18.470 align:start position:0%
question
uh

01:30:18.470 --> 01:30:18.480 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:30:21.110 --> 01:30:21.120 align:start position:0%
is in a follow-up or two if i may
 
01:30:24.629 --> 01:30:24.639 align:start position:0%
um here in new hampshire uh dartmouth uh
 
01:30:26.629 --> 01:30:26.639 align:start position:0%
used to be known as the indians uh do
 
01:30:29.270 --> 01:30:29.280 align:start position:0%
you know how that came about
 
01:30:31.110 --> 01:30:31.120 align:start position:0%
i am not sure
 
01:30:34.629 --> 01:30:34.639 align:start position:0%
uh if i may then uh dartmouth was
 
01:30:38.229 --> 01:30:38.239 align:start position:0%
founded in 1769 by eleazar wheelock as a
 
01:30:39.669 --> 01:30:39.679 align:start position:0%
school to
 
01:30:41.270 --> 01:30:41.280 align:start position:0%
primarily in
 
01:30:43.430 --> 01:30:43.440 align:start position:0%
educate native americans indians
 
01:30:45.510 --> 01:30:45.520 align:start position:0%
indigenous people
 
01:30:48.070 --> 01:30:48.080 align:start position:0%
even today dartmouth allows special
 
01:30:49.510 --> 01:30:49.520 align:start position:0%
carve outs for
 
01:30:51.669 --> 01:30:51.679 align:start position:0%
native american indian indigenous people
 
01:30:53.990 --> 01:30:54.000 align:start position:0%
to go to dartmouth dartmouth was founded
 
01:30:56.070 --> 01:30:56.080 align:start position:0%
for indians and the athletic teams were
 
01:30:58.149 --> 01:30:58.159 align:start position:0%
known as indians to celebrate that
 
01:31:00.149 --> 01:31:00.159 align:start position:0%
dartmouth heritage
 
01:31:03.270 --> 01:31:03.280 align:start position:0%
when dartmouth changed to the big green
 
01:31:03.280 --> 01:31:04.950 align:start position:0%
when dartmouth changed to the big green
uh

01:31:04.950 --> 01:31:04.960 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:31:07.270 --> 01:31:07.280 align:start position:0%
this is a question dartmouth changed the
 
01:31:08.390 --> 01:31:08.400 align:start position:0%
big green
 
01:31:10.790 --> 01:31:10.800 align:start position:0%
uh indian chiefs native americans
 
01:31:14.550 --> 01:31:14.560 align:start position:0%
indigenous people from all over came to
 
01:31:17.270 --> 01:31:17.280 align:start position:0%
hanover to argue that dartmouth should
 
01:31:19.990 --> 01:31:20.000 align:start position:0%
continue to honor its native american
 
01:31:22.950 --> 01:31:22.960 align:start position:0%
heritage and history by honoring
 
01:31:25.430 --> 01:31:25.440 align:start position:0%
indians as as they used to
 
01:31:25.440 --> 01:31:26.790 align:start position:0%
indians as as they used to
so

01:31:26.790 --> 01:31:26.800 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:31:30.310 --> 01:31:30.320 align:start position:0%
my question following that up is uh
 
01:31:32.070 --> 01:31:32.080 align:start position:0%
sports illustrated did a poll that
 
01:31:35.189 --> 01:31:35.199 align:start position:0%
showed 80 percent of native americans
 
01:31:37.590 --> 01:31:37.600 align:start position:0%
uh savored and relished and supported
 
01:31:40.950 --> 01:31:40.960 align:start position:0%
the the the way that teams honor once
 
01:31:42.550 --> 01:31:42.560 align:start position:0%
they get rid of some of the
 
01:31:44.149 --> 01:31:44.159 align:start position:0%
superfluous stuff the way the teams
 
01:31:44.159 --> 01:31:45.350 align:start position:0%
superfluous stuff the way the teams
honor

01:31:45.350 --> 01:31:45.360 align:start position:0%
honor
 
01:31:48.390 --> 01:31:48.400 align:start position:0%
native americans so my question is
 
01:31:50.870 --> 01:31:50.880 align:start position:0%
do you think dartmouth uh
 
01:31:54.550 --> 01:31:54.560 align:start position:0%
was disrespecting indians by selling by
 
01:31:56.390 --> 01:31:56.400 align:start position:0%
is the indians themselves
 
01:31:59.510 --> 01:31:59.520 align:start position:0%
celebrating the institution by honoring
 
01:32:03.350 --> 01:32:03.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:05.430 --> 01:32:05.440 align:start position:0%
they changed the name
 
01:32:08.550 --> 01:32:08.560 align:start position:0%
in 1974.
 
01:32:09.830 --> 01:32:09.840 align:start position:0%
it is now
 
01:32:09.840 --> 01:32:12.950 align:start position:0%
it is now
2022.

01:32:12.950 --> 01:32:12.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:12.960 --> 01:32:13.750 align:start position:0%
 
the

01:32:13.750 --> 01:32:13.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:32:16.070 --> 01:32:16.080 align:start position:0%
thoughts that were used back back then
 
01:32:17.189 --> 01:32:17.199 align:start position:0%
as far as
 
01:32:19.270 --> 01:32:19.280 align:start position:0%
discussing this topic are not
 
01:32:19.280 --> 01:32:21.990 align:start position:0%
discussing this topic are not
necessarily

01:32:21.990 --> 01:32:22.000 align:start position:0%
necessarily
 
01:32:24.470 --> 01:32:24.480 align:start position:0%
the same as they are today
 
01:32:27.510 --> 01:32:27.520 align:start position:0%
and when we hear the native americans
 
01:32:30.470 --> 01:32:30.480 align:start position:0%
new hampshire native americans
 
01:32:31.750 --> 01:32:31.760 align:start position:0%
talk about
 
01:32:34.709 --> 01:32:34.719 align:start position:0%
their thoughts of today
 
01:32:35.990 --> 01:32:36.000 align:start position:0%
you will hear
 
01:32:38.709 --> 01:32:38.719 align:start position:0%
that they're not happy with our current
 
01:32:38.719 --> 01:32:39.669 align:start position:0%
that they're not happy with our current
use

01:32:39.669 --> 01:32:39.679 align:start position:0%
use
 
01:32:42.629 --> 01:32:42.639 align:start position:0%
of mascots that are supposed to reflect
 
01:32:45.189 --> 01:32:45.199 align:start position:0%
who they are
 
01:32:48.070 --> 01:32:48.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:50.229 --> 01:32:50.239 align:start position:0%

thank you very much i'm representative
 
01:33:15.830 --> 01:33:15.840 align:start position:0%
timothy oregon from stratfor county
 
01:33:17.590 --> 01:33:17.600 align:start position:0%
district six with the towns of durham
 
01:33:20.149 --> 01:33:20.159 align:start position:0%
and madbury and um
 
01:33:22.629 --> 01:33:22.639 align:start position:0%
happily unh has never had a problem with
 
01:33:23.990 --> 01:33:24.000 align:start position:0%
its uh
 
01:33:26.790 --> 01:33:26.800 align:start position:0%
mascot which is the uh which is the
 
01:33:30.229 --> 01:33:30.239 align:start position:0%
wildcat and um i i i'm a former resident
 
01:33:32.390 --> 01:33:32.400 align:start position:0%
of hanover i did work for
 
01:33:34.709 --> 01:33:34.719 align:start position:0%
dartmouth college uh while for a time
 
01:33:36.790 --> 01:33:36.800 align:start position:0%
while i was living in hanover and um
 
01:33:38.229 --> 01:33:38.239 align:start position:0%
this that was
 
01:33:39.590 --> 01:33:39.600 align:start position:0%
in the air when the when there were the
 
01:33:42.149 --> 01:33:42.159 align:start position:0%
big green and certainly um
 
01:33:43.910 --> 01:33:43.920 align:start position:0%
dartmouth does not lack for school
 
01:33:46.070 --> 01:33:46.080 align:start position:0%
spirit it doesn't lack for loyalty from
 
01:33:47.590 --> 01:33:47.600 align:start position:0%
its students and alumni it's a very
 
01:33:49.669 --> 01:33:49.679 align:start position:0%
spirited place even with the big green
 
01:33:52.870 --> 01:33:52.880 align:start position:0%
so the former indian uh
 
01:33:56.149 --> 01:33:56.159 align:start position:0%
mascot was uh was uh
 
01:33:58.790 --> 01:33:58.800 align:start position:0%
unnecessary you know they're uh
 
01:34:00.310 --> 01:34:00.320 align:start position:0%
you know they're just as great a group
 
01:34:02.310 --> 01:34:02.320 align:start position:0%
it's just a great community with the big
 
01:34:03.830 --> 01:34:03.840 align:start position:0%
green is with the indians and they
 
01:34:03.840 --> 01:34:04.950 align:start position:0%
green is with the indians and they
actually

01:34:04.950 --> 01:34:04.960 align:start position:0%
actually
 
01:34:06.470 --> 01:34:06.480 align:start position:0%
um hanover actually still has an issue
 
01:34:07.750 --> 01:34:07.760 align:start position:0%
with the they're one of the eight
 
01:34:09.590 --> 01:34:09.600 align:start position:0%
schools that uh
 
01:34:10.870 --> 01:34:10.880 align:start position:0%
they've got a questionable nickname
 
01:34:13.510 --> 01:34:13.520 align:start position:0%
which was the marauders um
 
01:34:16.229 --> 01:34:16.239 align:start position:0%
i think and um i'm also uh
 
01:34:17.669 --> 01:34:17.679 align:start position:0%
before that i was born in south in
 
01:34:20.790 --> 01:34:20.800 align:start position:0%
indiana where notre dame is my
 
01:34:22.870 --> 01:34:22.880 align:start position:0%
father's a notre dame late father no
 
01:34:25.270 --> 01:34:25.280 align:start position:0%
name alumnus and i feel a little bit
 
01:34:27.910 --> 01:34:27.920 align:start position:0%
conflicted about the fighting irish logo
 
01:34:30.229 --> 01:34:30.239 align:start position:0%
partially because it's a misnomer
 
01:34:31.830 --> 01:34:31.840 align:start position:0%
the school is actually founded by french
 
01:34:33.830 --> 01:34:33.840 align:start position:0%
priests not irish priests but uh there's
 
01:34:35.430 --> 01:34:35.440 align:start position:0%
a difference between
 
01:34:37.430 --> 01:34:37.440 align:start position:0%
quote unquote other ethnics
 
01:34:39.510 --> 01:34:39.520 align:start position:0%
and and uh and
 
01:34:42.709 --> 01:34:42.719 align:start position:0%
and the uh native tribes um indians as
 
01:34:44.310 --> 01:34:44.320 align:start position:0%
as uh
 
01:34:46.229 --> 01:34:46.239 align:start position:0%
they're often commonly referred to which
 
01:34:46.239 --> 01:34:47.189 align:start position:0%
they're often commonly referred to which
um

01:34:47.189 --> 01:34:47.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:34:48.870 --> 01:34:48.880 align:start position:0%
which is that you know we
 
01:34:50.790 --> 01:34:50.800 align:start position:0%
you know the white people uh came here
 
01:34:50.800 --> 01:34:51.750 align:start position:0%
you know the white people uh came here
we

01:34:51.750 --> 01:34:51.760 align:start position:0%
we
 
01:34:54.149 --> 01:34:54.159 align:start position:0%
took their land we uh
 
01:34:56.629 --> 01:34:56.639 align:start position:0%
killed many you know we
 
01:34:59.109 --> 01:34:59.119 align:start position:0%
many cases embarked on genocide um and
 
01:35:00.790 --> 01:35:00.800 align:start position:0%
it's uh
 
01:35:02.149 --> 01:35:02.159 align:start position:0%
and we've often sort of written them out
 
01:35:04.310 --> 01:35:04.320 align:start position:0%
of history especially out of uh
 
01:35:05.669 --> 01:35:05.679 align:start position:0%
recent history but you know they're
 
01:35:07.510 --> 01:35:07.520 align:start position:0%
still they survived they're still very
 
01:35:10.550 --> 01:35:10.560 align:start position:0%
much there they're still uh just as uh
 
01:35:11.830 --> 01:35:11.840 align:start position:0%
you know there's still a very strong
 
01:35:13.750 --> 01:35:13.760 align:start position:0%
force here
 
01:35:15.830 --> 01:35:15.840 align:start position:0%
here on the north american continent and
 
01:35:17.910 --> 01:35:17.920 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire and also many ways the
 
01:35:20.070 --> 01:35:20.080 align:start position:0%
stewards of the land that we've all
 
01:35:23.350 --> 01:35:23.360 align:start position:0%
benefited from so like we
 
01:35:25.510 --> 01:35:25.520 align:start position:0%
the colonists certainly benefited from
 
01:35:27.830 --> 01:35:27.840 align:start position:0%
what they've done uh previously to the
 
01:35:29.510 --> 01:35:29.520 align:start position:0%
lands i think um
 
01:35:30.709 --> 01:35:30.719 align:start position:0%
so i think
 
01:35:30.719 --> 01:35:31.590 align:start position:0%
so i think
using

01:35:31.590 --> 01:35:31.600 align:start position:0%
using
 
01:35:33.510 --> 01:35:33.520 align:start position:0%
using native american mascots it tends
 
01:35:35.430 --> 01:35:35.440 align:start position:0%
to turn them into cartoons and there is
 
01:35:38.149 --> 01:35:38.159 align:start position:0%
sort of a difference between that and uh
 
01:35:39.189 --> 01:35:39.199 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:35:41.350 --> 01:35:41.360 align:start position:0%
using some other uh the name of some
 
01:35:42.709 --> 01:35:42.719 align:start position:0%
other ethnic group like the fighting
 
01:35:44.790 --> 01:35:44.800 align:start position:0%
irish or the uh
 
01:35:47.189 --> 01:35:47.199 align:start position:0%
hofstra flying dutchman or
 
01:35:47.199 --> 01:35:49.510 align:start position:0%
hofstra flying dutchman or
those

01:35:49.510 --> 01:35:49.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:52.709 --> 01:35:52.719 align:start position:0%
or things like that and um
 
01:35:56.629 --> 01:35:56.639 align:start position:0%
also point out that when you uh when you
 
01:35:58.550 --> 01:35:58.560 align:start position:0%
when you change the name you know with
 
01:36:00.709 --> 01:36:00.719 align:start position:0%
sports teams it has very little effect
 
01:36:02.310 --> 01:36:02.320 align:start position:0%
has no effect whatsoever on their
 
01:36:04.149 --> 01:36:04.159 align:start position:0%
performance the uh
 
01:36:05.910 --> 01:36:05.920 align:start position:0%
for example the washington redskins
 
01:36:07.590 --> 01:36:07.600 align:start position:0%
became the washington football team and
 
01:36:09.669 --> 01:36:09.679 align:start position:0%
they actually uh
 
01:36:11.030 --> 01:36:11.040 align:start position:0%
although they missed the playoffs this
 
01:36:12.229 --> 01:36:12.239 align:start position:0%
year they've actually been playing
 
01:36:14.229 --> 01:36:14.239 align:start position:0%
better since they changed the name so
 
01:36:14.239 --> 01:36:16.470 align:start position:0%
better since they changed the name so
apparently

01:36:16.470 --> 01:36:16.480 align:start position:0%
apparently
 
01:36:19.189 --> 01:36:19.199 align:start position:0%
the success they had the past was
 
01:36:19.199 --> 01:36:20.070 align:start position:0%
the success they had the past was
not

01:36:20.070 --> 01:36:20.080 align:start position:0%
not
 
01:36:21.590 --> 01:36:21.600 align:start position:0%
not because of the nickname and not
 
01:36:23.750 --> 01:36:23.760 align:start position:0%
because of you know the cartoon on the
 
01:36:25.510 --> 01:36:25.520 align:start position:0%
side of their defensive cartoon on the
 
01:36:28.229 --> 01:36:28.239 align:start position:0%
side of their helmet so um
 
01:36:30.070 --> 01:36:30.080 align:start position:0%
and i'm sure we'll probably see the same
 
01:36:31.109 --> 01:36:31.119 align:start position:0%
with the
 
01:36:34.229 --> 01:36:34.239 align:start position:0%
cleveland guardians they're probably uh
 
01:36:36.629 --> 01:36:36.639 align:start position:0%
i mean they're not one of the top teams
 
01:36:38.229 --> 01:36:38.239 align:start position:0%
in the american league but they probably
 
01:36:40.709 --> 01:36:40.719 align:start position:0%
i guarantee they will probably
 
01:36:42.310 --> 01:36:42.320 align:start position:0%
play just as well this year as the
 
01:36:43.830 --> 01:36:43.840 align:start position:0%
guardians as they did under their
 
01:36:46.229 --> 01:36:46.239 align:start position:0%
previous nickname so like they're uh
 
01:36:48.149 --> 01:36:48.159 align:start position:0%
and they've had a lot of great teams in
 
01:36:49.830 --> 01:36:49.840 align:start position:0%
the past and they did not succeed
 
01:36:51.030 --> 01:36:51.040 align:start position:0%
because of you know the offensive
 
01:36:53.189 --> 01:36:53.199 align:start position:0%
cartoon on their baseball caps it was uh
 
01:36:56.390 --> 01:36:56.400 align:start position:0%
for other reasons and um
 
01:36:56.400 --> 01:36:57.669 align:start position:0%
for other reasons and um
so

01:36:57.669 --> 01:36:57.679 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:36:59.669 --> 01:36:59.679 align:start position:0%
so i think probably so anyways i think
 
01:37:02.629 --> 01:37:02.639 align:start position:0%
this is a this is a uh
 
01:37:04.950 --> 01:37:04.960 align:start position:0%
you know this is a good bill it's um
 
01:37:04.960 --> 01:37:06.390 align:start position:0%
you know this is a good bill it's um
and

01:37:06.390 --> 01:37:06.400 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:37:07.830 --> 01:37:07.840 align:start position:0%
and i know you'll hear about the
 
01:37:09.750 --> 01:37:09.760 align:start position:0%
traditions of high schools and colleges
 
01:37:11.590 --> 01:37:11.600 align:start position:0%
but those can evolve a lot quicker than
 
01:37:13.510 --> 01:37:13.520 align:start position:0%
um than we
 
01:37:15.669 --> 01:37:15.679 align:start position:0%
than we than we think they can and also
 
01:37:17.430 --> 01:37:17.440 align:start position:0%
some sort of cheapens you know the
 
01:37:19.109 --> 01:37:19.119 align:start position:0%
status of uh
 
01:37:21.990 --> 01:37:22.000 align:start position:0%
you know the the uh the traditions of a
 
01:37:24.470 --> 01:37:24.480 align:start position:0%
you know indigenous nation or tribe as
 
01:37:26.709 --> 01:37:26.719 align:start position:0%
they're often called to like you know
 
01:37:28.310 --> 01:37:28.320 align:start position:0%
equate them with the traditions of a
 
01:37:30.149 --> 01:37:30.159 align:start position:0%
high school or a college you know that's
 
01:37:31.590 --> 01:37:31.600 align:start position:0%
not that it's not that it's not
 
01:37:33.189 --> 01:37:33.199 align:start position:0%
important time of your life but there's
 
01:37:34.550 --> 01:37:34.560 align:start position:0%
a little bit
 
01:37:36.390 --> 01:37:36.400 align:start position:0%
a little bit of difference between
 
01:37:36.400 --> 01:37:37.510 align:start position:0%
a little bit of difference between
um

01:37:37.510 --> 01:37:37.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:37:39.270 --> 01:37:39.280 align:start position:0%
your identity as a member of your school
 
01:37:41.030 --> 01:37:41.040 align:start position:0%
for a few years that that you were there
 
01:37:43.350 --> 01:37:43.360 align:start position:0%
and um then there is uh
 
01:37:45.510 --> 01:37:45.520 align:start position:0%
then there is you know being part of a
 
01:37:46.870 --> 01:37:46.880 align:start position:0%
nation that's been around for ten
 
01:37:48.310 --> 01:37:48.320 align:start position:0%
thousand you know it's been i've been
 
01:37:51.669 --> 01:37:51.679 align:start position:0%
here for thousands of years so i i
 
01:37:53.510 --> 01:37:53.520 align:start position:0%
urge you to urge you to pass your bill i
 
01:37:56.390 --> 01:37:56.400 align:start position:0%
know it's difficult sometimes especially
 
01:37:58.229 --> 01:37:58.239 align:start position:0%
in rochester where we had a controversy
 
01:37:59.830 --> 01:37:59.840 align:start position:0%
a couple years ago
 
01:38:02.229 --> 01:38:02.239 align:start position:0%
they tried to rebrand their raiders as a
 
01:38:04.070 --> 01:38:04.080 align:start position:0%
pirate and i guess the pirate is also
 
01:38:05.590 --> 01:38:05.600 align:start position:0%
sort of an inaccurate historical
 
01:38:05.600 --> 01:38:07.030 align:start position:0%
sort of an inaccurate historical
stereotype

01:38:07.030 --> 01:38:07.040 align:start position:0%
stereotype
 
01:38:08.470 --> 01:38:08.480 align:start position:0%
they tried to rebrand their teams of
 
01:38:11.030 --> 01:38:11.040 align:start position:0%
raiders and unfortunately the old indian
 
01:38:11.040 --> 01:38:12.790 align:start position:0%
raiders and unfortunately the old indian
uh

01:38:12.790 --> 01:38:12.800 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:38:15.750 --> 01:38:15.760 align:start position:0%
the old indian logos still like uh
 
01:38:17.910 --> 01:38:17.920 align:start position:0%
managed to like resurface and people you
 
01:38:20.310 --> 01:38:20.320 align:start position:0%
know unofficially started uh using them
 
01:38:22.310 --> 01:38:22.320 align:start position:0%
so there's uh
 
01:38:23.750 --> 01:38:23.760 align:start position:0%
that community will have to come up with
 
01:38:26.470 --> 01:38:26.480 align:start position:0%
solution to to that issue that's um but
 
01:38:28.310 --> 01:38:28.320 align:start position:0%
so i i
 
01:38:30.790 --> 01:38:30.800 align:start position:0%
i urge you to so i would i would
 
01:38:32.390 --> 01:38:32.400 align:start position:0%
appreciate the i would urge you to pass
 
01:38:34.950 --> 01:38:34.960 align:start position:0%
this bill and um thank you
 
01:38:37.189 --> 01:38:37.199 align:start position:0%
any uh questions for the representative
 
01:38:39.750 --> 01:38:39.760 align:start position:0%
oh sure representative
 
01:38:42.390 --> 01:38:42.400 align:start position:0%
since you brought up the indian slash
 
01:38:46.149 --> 01:38:46.159 align:start position:0%
guardians which were my home team
 
01:38:49.510 --> 01:38:49.520 align:start position:0%
the indian slash guardians oh yes
 
01:38:49.520 --> 01:38:50.390 align:start position:0%
the indian slash guardians oh yes
um

01:38:50.390 --> 01:38:50.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:38:53.910 --> 01:38:53.920 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that
 
01:38:56.550 --> 01:38:56.560 align:start position:0%
most of the native peoples of the area
 
01:38:59.510 --> 01:38:59.520 align:start position:0%
were very upset to lose that name
 
01:39:02.470 --> 01:39:02.480 align:start position:0%
because they were proud of it
 
01:39:02.480 --> 01:39:04.310 align:start position:0%
because they were proud of it
um

01:39:04.310 --> 01:39:04.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:39:06.470 --> 01:39:06.480 align:start position:0%
i just wondered yeah i just wondered if
 
01:39:07.910 --> 01:39:07.920 align:start position:0%
you were aware of that since you brought
 
01:39:10.629 --> 01:39:10.639 align:start position:0%
them up i do not know that i actually do
 
01:39:14.070 --> 01:39:14.080 align:start position:0%
know the history of how the nickname
 
01:39:16.390 --> 01:39:16.400 align:start position:0%
came to be adopted um
 
01:39:18.870 --> 01:39:18.880 align:start position:0%
so in the 1890s actually that was a
 
01:39:21.590 --> 01:39:21.600 align:start position:0%
previous franchisee i
 
01:39:23.990 --> 01:39:24.000 align:start position:0%
i think you answered yes so i i've not
 
01:39:27.189 --> 01:39:27.199 align:start position:0%
seen those polls um so i can't
 
01:39:28.470 --> 01:39:28.480 align:start position:0%
any further questions representative
 
01:39:28.480 --> 01:39:29.830 align:start position:0%
any further questions representative
moffatt

01:39:29.830 --> 01:39:29.840 align:start position:0%
moffatt
 
01:39:31.109 --> 01:39:31.119 align:start position:0%
thank you mr thank you representative
 
01:39:33.669 --> 01:39:33.679 align:start position:0%
morgan for taking my question and maybe
 
01:39:35.350 --> 01:39:35.360 align:start position:0%
a possible follow-up
 
01:39:36.629 --> 01:39:36.639 align:start position:0%
uh would you believe that when i was in
 
01:39:39.430 --> 01:39:39.440 align:start position:0%
college i had a date with a
 
01:39:41.669 --> 01:39:41.679 align:start position:0%
call student from hanover and i asked
 
01:39:44.709 --> 01:39:44.719 align:start position:0%
her what was a marauder and she as you
 
01:39:44.719 --> 01:39:45.510 align:start position:0%
her what was a marauder and she as you
said

01:39:45.510 --> 01:39:45.520 align:start position:0%
said
 
01:39:47.830 --> 01:39:47.840 align:start position:0%
as a pirate
 
01:39:50.709 --> 01:39:50.719 align:start position:0%
which leads me to my question
 
01:39:50.719 --> 01:39:51.990 align:start position:0%
which leads me to my question
marauders

01:39:51.990 --> 01:39:52.000 align:start position:0%
marauders
 
01:39:54.229 --> 01:39:54.239 align:start position:0%
are not necessarily indigenous the re
 
01:39:56.310 --> 01:39:56.320 align:start position:0%
belmont is the red raiders which is not
 
01:39:56.320 --> 01:39:57.669 align:start position:0%
belmont is the red raiders which is not
necessarily

01:39:57.669 --> 01:39:57.679 align:start position:0%
necessarily
 
01:39:59.350 --> 01:39:59.360 align:start position:0%
indigenous and there are a number of
 
01:40:01.350 --> 01:40:01.360 align:start position:0%
schools that are the warriors which is
 
01:40:03.189 --> 01:40:03.199 align:start position:0%
uh as representative cannon said with
 
01:40:05.510 --> 01:40:05.520 align:start position:0%
regard to vikings or fighting iris is
 
01:40:07.669 --> 01:40:07.679 align:start position:0%
kind of a broad generic warriors could
 
01:40:10.870 --> 01:40:10.880 align:start position:0%
be greek warriors so you name it
 
01:40:10.880 --> 01:40:12.229 align:start position:0%
be greek warriors so you name it
so

01:40:12.229 --> 01:40:12.239 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:40:12.239 --> 01:40:13.189 align:start position:0%
so
i

01:40:13.189 --> 01:40:13.199 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:40:15.430 --> 01:40:15.440 align:start position:0%
my question is you're all concerned
 
01:40:17.590 --> 01:40:17.600 align:start position:0%
about the the heavy hand of the state
 
01:40:19.510 --> 01:40:19.520 align:start position:0%
coming and telling belmont they can't be
 
01:40:21.350 --> 01:40:21.360 align:start position:0%
the warriors or winner or the red
 
01:40:22.790 --> 01:40:22.800 align:start position:0%
raiders winner kind of can't be the
 
01:40:25.109 --> 01:40:25.119 align:start position:0%
warriors hanover can be the marauders
 
01:40:27.030 --> 01:40:27.040 align:start position:0%
none of these names are specific to
 
01:40:28.629 --> 01:40:28.639 align:start position:0%
indigenous peoples
 
01:40:30.390 --> 01:40:30.400 align:start position:0%
do you think that is a possible first
 
01:40:32.550 --> 01:40:32.560 align:start position:0%
amendment issue with the state telling
 
01:40:32.560 --> 01:40:33.830 align:start position:0%
amendment issue with the state telling
schools

01:40:33.830 --> 01:40:33.840 align:start position:0%
schools
 
01:40:33.840 --> 01:40:34.629 align:start position:0%
schools
uh

01:40:34.629 --> 01:40:34.639 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:40:37.270 --> 01:40:37.280 align:start position:0%
how they can cloud their their teams
 
01:40:39.750 --> 01:40:39.760 align:start position:0%
well it's not a first amendment issue um
 
01:40:41.590 --> 01:40:41.600 align:start position:0%
so it was there's no freedom of the
 
01:40:44.629 --> 01:40:44.639 align:start position:0%
press violation there the uh and
 
01:40:46.070 --> 01:40:46.080 align:start position:0%
secretly speaking school district isn't
 
01:40:48.070 --> 01:40:48.080 align:start position:0%
even a person so it doesn't have uh free
 
01:40:51.270 --> 01:40:51.280 align:start position:0%
speech rights but that's uh so i'm
 
01:40:53.350 --> 01:40:53.360 align:start position:0%
not concerned not that concerned about
 
01:40:55.510 --> 01:40:55.520 align:start position:0%
it and i mean i don't really know
 
01:40:56.870 --> 01:40:56.880 align:start position:0%
i'm not an expert in the history of how
 
01:40:58.629 --> 01:40:58.639 align:start position:0%
hanover high school got its nickname or
 
01:41:01.430 --> 01:41:01.440 align:start position:0%
belmont high school
 
01:41:02.790 --> 01:41:02.800 align:start position:0%
thank you thanks
 
01:41:04.790 --> 01:41:04.800 align:start position:0%

01:41:58.830 --> 01:41:58.840 align:start position:0%
this is
 
01:42:01.830 --> 01:42:01.840 align:start position:0%
uh because you want me to limit my
 
01:42:01.840 --> 01:42:04.070 align:start position:0%
uh because you want me to limit my
remarks

01:42:04.070 --> 01:42:04.080 align:start position:0%
remarks
 
01:42:06.550 --> 01:42:06.560 align:start position:0%
um i could take each one of the
 
01:42:08.870 --> 01:42:08.880 align:start position:0%
questions so far and you could go into
 
01:42:08.880 --> 01:42:10.229 align:start position:0%
questions so far and you could go into
detail

01:42:10.229 --> 01:42:10.239 align:start position:0%
detail
 
01:42:12.709 --> 01:42:12.719 align:start position:0%
about the changes the name changes and
 
01:42:15.189 --> 01:42:15.199 align:start position:0%
that sort of thing first of all i want
 
01:42:22.550 --> 01:42:22.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:25.590 --> 01:42:25.600 align:start position:0%
i grew up in the
 
01:42:28.629 --> 01:42:28.639 align:start position:0%
cowboy and indian era where we ran
 
01:42:30.709 --> 01:42:30.719 align:start position:0%
around with cap guns
 
01:42:32.790 --> 01:42:32.800 align:start position:0%
and we ran through the woods chasing the
 
01:42:34.629 --> 01:42:34.639 align:start position:0%
indians to kill them because that's the
 
01:42:37.990 --> 01:42:38.000 align:start position:0%
way it was presented in the movies so we
 
01:42:40.390 --> 01:42:40.400 align:start position:0%
adopted that
 
01:42:42.470 --> 01:42:42.480 align:start position:0%
new hampshire had a
 
01:42:44.470 --> 01:42:44.480 align:start position:0%
law passed
 
01:42:47.750 --> 01:42:47.760 align:start position:0%
uh in this when it was in the process of
 
01:42:50.390 --> 01:42:50.400 align:start position:0%
wanting to remove all indian resistance
 
01:42:53.830 --> 01:42:53.840 align:start position:0%
to come to the settlement of settle
 
01:42:56.470 --> 01:42:56.480 align:start position:0%
settlements throughout the state where
 
01:42:58.149 --> 01:42:58.159 align:start position:0%
it passed a law
 
01:42:59.830 --> 01:42:59.840 align:start position:0%
that all
 
01:43:02.310 --> 01:43:02.320 align:start position:0%
that they would pay a bounty for any
 
01:43:04.390 --> 01:43:04.400 align:start position:0%
indian scalp
 
01:43:07.590 --> 01:43:07.600 align:start position:0%
and that bounty went up in value
 
01:43:07.600 --> 01:43:08.830 align:start position:0%
and that bounty went up in value
over

01:43:08.830 --> 01:43:08.840 align:start position:0%
over
 
01:43:08.840 --> 01:43:10.550 align:start position:0%
over
time

01:43:10.550 --> 01:43:10.560 align:start position:0%
time
 
01:43:10.560 --> 01:43:11.669 align:start position:0%
time
so

01:43:11.669 --> 01:43:11.679 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:43:14.149 --> 01:43:14.159 align:start position:0%
there was a specific effort to eliminate
 
01:43:17.189 --> 01:43:17.199 align:start position:0%
the last of the native peoples here
 
01:43:19.830 --> 01:43:19.840 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire so that it could be
 
01:43:23.350 --> 01:43:23.360 align:start position:0%
occupied by white europeans without
 
01:43:26.310 --> 01:43:26.320 align:start position:0%
threat of attack
 
01:43:29.830 --> 01:43:29.840 align:start position:0%
but in the 21st century
 
01:43:29.840 --> 01:43:30.870 align:start position:0%
but in the 21st century
i

01:43:30.870 --> 01:43:30.880 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:43:33.750 --> 01:43:33.760 align:start position:0%
was an educator at lebanon where it was
 
01:43:36.629 --> 01:43:36.639 align:start position:0%
the raiders i taught a course on
 
01:43:40.550 --> 01:43:40.560 align:start position:0%
in social studies on uh native americans
 
01:43:42.629 --> 01:43:42.639 align:start position:0%
but it never really crossed my mind to
 
01:43:45.350 --> 01:43:45.360 align:start position:0%
make the connection
 
01:43:47.350 --> 01:43:47.360 align:start position:0%
between the course and the fact they
 
01:43:49.510 --> 01:43:49.520 align:start position:0%
were call red raiders
 
01:43:53.030 --> 01:43:53.040 align:start position:0%
so uh i was given this t-shirt
 
01:43:55.590 --> 01:43:55.600 align:start position:0%
at my 75th birthday
 
01:43:57.430 --> 01:43:57.440 align:start position:0%
five years ago
 
01:44:00.070 --> 01:44:00.080 align:start position:0%
uh didn't really cross my mind then but
 
01:44:03.350 --> 01:44:03.360 align:start position:0%
as i got involved with the uh
 
01:44:06.629 --> 01:44:06.639 align:start position:0%
indigenous group at unh and i began to
 
01:44:09.030 --> 01:44:09.040 align:start position:0%
do my own research to learn about the
 
01:44:11.030 --> 01:44:11.040 align:start position:0%
history of native americans
 
01:44:13.270 --> 01:44:13.280 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire
 
01:44:17.590 --> 01:44:17.600 align:start position:0%
my mind changed that we needed at ins at
 
01:44:20.470 --> 01:44:20.480 align:start position:0%
rochester spalding high school to do
 
01:44:23.669 --> 01:44:23.679 align:start position:0%
away with the red raider images as
 
01:44:25.350 --> 01:44:25.360 align:start position:0%
portrayed here because they're
 
01:44:29.030 --> 01:44:29.040 align:start position:0%
inaccurate anyway to any there
 
01:44:29.040 --> 01:44:30.070 align:start position:0%
inaccurate anyway to any there
um

01:44:30.070 --> 01:44:30.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:44:34.310 --> 01:44:34.320 align:start position:0%
and to substitute something in its place
 
01:44:36.149 --> 01:44:36.159 align:start position:0%
at a choice for the school
 
01:44:38.790 --> 01:44:38.800 align:start position:0%
however in our most recent debate with
 
01:44:41.390 --> 01:44:41.400 align:start position:0%
the school board on this
 
01:44:41.400 --> 01:44:42.950 align:start position:0%
the school board on this
[Music]

01:44:42.950 --> 01:44:42.960 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:44:46.149 --> 01:44:46.159 align:start position:0%
i've got the notes here
 
01:44:49.430 --> 01:44:49.440 align:start position:0%
the population came forward
 
01:44:52.310 --> 01:44:52.320 align:start position:0%
essentially obviously divided it was a
 
01:44:54.709 --> 01:44:54.719 align:start position:0%
very emotional argument from those who
 
01:44:58.310 --> 01:44:58.320 align:start position:0%
wanted to continue the red raider name
 
01:44:58.320 --> 01:44:59.910 align:start position:0%
wanted to continue the red raider name
why

01:44:59.910 --> 01:44:59.920 align:start position:0%
why
 
01:45:01.669 --> 01:45:01.679 align:start position:0%
because that's what's there that's
 
01:45:03.109 --> 01:45:03.119 align:start position:0%
what's been there that's how you
 
01:45:08.149 --> 01:45:08.159 align:start position:0%
represent your school uh spirit of core
 
01:45:10.070 --> 01:45:10.080 align:start position:0%
and then there are those that are more
 
01:45:11.669 --> 01:45:11.679 align:start position:0%
sensitive to
 
01:45:11.679 --> 01:45:14.149 align:start position:0%
sensitive to
uh

01:45:14.149 --> 01:45:14.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:16.709 --> 01:45:16.719 align:start position:0%
the battle that's going on both in
 
01:45:18.390 --> 01:45:18.400 align:start position:0%
canada because i live in canada in the
 
01:45:20.629 --> 01:45:20.639 align:start position:0%
summertime so i'm intimately involved
 
01:45:22.950 --> 01:45:22.960 align:start position:0%
with it here and here in the united
 
01:45:26.470 --> 01:45:26.480 align:start position:0%
states to gain equal representation for
 
01:45:28.709 --> 01:45:28.719 align:start position:0%
indigenous peoples
 
01:45:32.229 --> 01:45:32.239 align:start position:0%
and something that is not shaped in
 
01:45:34.310 --> 01:45:34.320 align:start position:0%
these types of images
 
01:45:37.350 --> 01:45:37.360 align:start position:0%
new hampshire uh department of education
 
01:45:40.709 --> 01:45:40.719 align:start position:0%
has on the books the recommendation to
 
01:45:43.189 --> 01:45:43.199 align:start position:0%
do away with these images it's been
 
01:45:47.030 --> 01:45:47.040 align:start position:0%
there for years do you know that right
 
01:45:47.040 --> 01:45:49.590 align:start position:0%
there for years do you know that right
right

01:45:49.590 --> 01:45:49.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:49.600 --> 01:45:50.470 align:start position:0%
 
but

01:45:50.470 --> 01:45:50.480 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:45:53.189 --> 01:45:53.199 align:start position:0%
they have no enforcement power
 
01:45:56.950 --> 01:45:56.960 align:start position:0%
all the states around you have
 
01:45:59.590 --> 01:45:59.600 align:start position:0%
put in the enforcement power of passing
 
01:46:01.270 --> 01:46:01.280 align:start position:0%
this law
 
01:46:03.910 --> 01:46:03.920 align:start position:0%
we're asking you to do the same thing
 
01:46:06.390 --> 01:46:06.400 align:start position:0%
even though in the absence you are the
 
01:46:08.629 --> 01:46:08.639 align:start position:0%
only state
 
01:46:11.270 --> 01:46:11.280 align:start position:0%
or province
 
01:46:15.270 --> 01:46:15.280 align:start position:0%
in north america that has no reservation
 
01:46:18.070 --> 01:46:18.080 align:start position:0%
to speak for itself
 
01:46:20.790 --> 01:46:20.800 align:start position:0%
because new hampshire was successful in
 
01:46:23.510 --> 01:46:23.520 align:start position:0%
completely eliminating the presence of
 
01:46:24.830 --> 01:46:24.840 align:start position:0%
the native
 
01:46:24.840 --> 01:46:26.629 align:start position:0%
the native
peoples

01:46:26.629 --> 01:46:26.639 align:start position:0%
peoples
 
01:46:31.030 --> 01:46:31.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:33.350 --> 01:46:33.360 align:start position:0%
saint francis in quebec
 
01:46:35.669 --> 01:46:35.679 align:start position:0%
or melted into the indian groups in
 
01:46:39.270 --> 01:46:39.280 align:start position:0%
maine or into vermont
 
01:46:42.550 --> 01:46:42.560 align:start position:0%
so it's an emotional issue i hear it in
 
01:46:45.669 --> 01:46:45.679 align:start position:0%
your questions of support possibly of
 
01:46:48.709 --> 01:46:48.719 align:start position:0%
the indians at uh
 
01:46:50.229 --> 01:46:50.239 align:start position:0%
at dartmouth
 
01:46:52.470 --> 01:46:52.480 align:start position:0%
or these other groups need to be
 
01:46:56.310 --> 01:46:56.320 align:start position:0%
represented this is focused this bill is
 
01:46:56.320 --> 01:46:57.590 align:start position:0%
represented this is focused this bill is
focused

01:46:57.590 --> 01:46:57.600 align:start position:0%
focused
 
01:47:00.310 --> 01:47:00.320 align:start position:0%
on dealing specifically with
 
01:47:02.870 --> 01:47:02.880 align:start position:0%
the issue of
 
01:47:04.870 --> 01:47:04.880 align:start position:0%
doing away
 
01:47:07.430 --> 01:47:07.440 align:start position:0%
with characterization
 
01:47:10.629 --> 01:47:10.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:13.430 --> 01:47:13.440 align:start position:0%
group of people
 
01:47:15.510 --> 01:47:15.520 align:start position:0%
one of the most
 
01:47:18.470 --> 01:47:18.480 align:start position:0%
articulate speakers at the debate in
 
01:47:22.550 --> 01:47:22.560 align:start position:0%
rochester was a 16 year old native
 
01:47:22.560 --> 01:47:23.750 align:start position:0%
rochester was a 16 year old native
student

01:47:23.750 --> 01:47:23.760 align:start position:0%
student
 
01:47:25.910 --> 01:47:25.920 align:start position:0%
who objected to this
 
01:47:28.149 --> 01:47:28.159 align:start position:0%
and i'll be the first to admit it went
 
01:47:30.390 --> 01:47:30.400 align:start position:0%
right over the head of the majority of
 
01:47:31.990 --> 01:47:32.000 align:start position:0%
the school board
 
01:47:35.270 --> 01:47:35.280 align:start position:0%
so you represent
 
01:47:37.189 --> 01:47:37.199 align:start position:0%
the state of new hampshire
 
01:47:39.109 --> 01:47:39.119 align:start position:0%
the need to address
 
01:47:42.149 --> 01:47:42.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:44.629 --> 01:47:44.639 align:start position:0%
where those
 
01:47:45.590 --> 01:47:45.600 align:start position:0%
at the
 
01:47:48.629 --> 01:47:48.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:50.390 --> 01:47:50.400 align:start position:0%
need guidance
 
01:47:52.390 --> 01:47:52.400 align:start position:0%
and so that's what we're asking you to
 
01:47:56.310 --> 01:47:56.320 align:start position:0%
provide is guidance by passing this law
 
01:47:59.750 --> 01:47:59.760 align:start position:0%
to bring new hampshire up to the 21st
 
01:47:59.760 --> 01:48:01.270 align:start position:0%
to bring new hampshire up to the 21st
century

01:48:01.270 --> 01:48:01.280 align:start position:0%

she would represent canada has already
said

01:48:47.189 --> 01:48:47.199 align:start position:0%
said
 
01:48:49.189 --> 01:48:49.199 align:start position:0%
uh just to reiterate that this bill is
 
01:48:50.870 --> 01:48:50.880 align:start position:0%
about stopping public schools from
 
01:48:52.629 --> 01:48:52.639 align:start position:0%
perpetuating negative and damaging
 
01:48:55.030 --> 01:48:55.040 align:start position:0%
stereotypes about indigenous people
 
01:48:57.109 --> 01:48:57.119 align:start position:0%
and as has already been mentioned this
 
01:48:58.310 --> 01:48:58.320 align:start position:0%
has been
 
01:49:00.149 --> 01:49:00.159 align:start position:0%
reinforced by our own state board of
 
01:49:01.910 --> 01:49:01.920 align:start position:0%

01:49:08.790 --> 01:49:08.800 align:start position:0%
we should be focused on ensuring that
 
01:49:11.030 --> 01:49:11.040 align:start position:0%
new hampshire schools foster safe
 
01:49:12.709 --> 01:49:12.719 align:start position:0%
inclusive learning environments for all
 
01:49:14.709 --> 01:49:14.719 align:start position:0%
students and heavy native american
 
01:49:16.870 --> 01:49:16.880 align:start position:0%
mascots undermines that core principle
 
01:49:18.310 --> 01:49:18.320 align:start position:0%
that we should be all striving towards
 
01:49:20.790 --> 01:49:20.800 align:start position:0%
so thank you so much i have testimony if
 
01:49:23.189 --> 01:49:23.199 align:start position:0%

01:51:06.310 --> 01:51:06.320 align:start position:0%
banned the use of human mascots the law
 
01:51:08.790 --> 01:51:08.800 align:start position:0%
basically states you cannot disparage a
 
01:51:12.229 --> 01:51:12.239 align:start position:0%
race or uplift a race more than any
 
01:51:14.310 --> 01:51:14.320 align:start position:0%
other race in that school and that's
 
01:51:16.950 --> 01:51:16.960 align:start position:0%
exactly what mascots do so no matter
 
01:51:19.109 --> 01:51:19.119 align:start position:0%
what side of this bill you're on
 
01:51:20.790 --> 01:51:20.800 align:start position:0%
whether you're for mascots whether
 
01:51:23.350 --> 01:51:23.360 align:start position:0%
you're against mascots it's already been
 
01:51:25.350 --> 01:51:25.360 align:start position:0%
banned in the state
 
01:51:28.870 --> 01:51:28.880 align:start position:0%
this bill is just codifying that ban
 
01:51:30.950 --> 01:51:30.960 align:start position:0%
and it is making it clear to the
 
01:51:33.189 --> 01:51:33.199 align:start position:0%
institutions within that state that
 
01:51:35.589 --> 01:51:35.599 align:start position:0%
human mascots will not be tolerated
 
01:51:35.599 --> 01:51:38.149 align:start position:0%
human mascots will not be tolerated
anymore

01:51:38.149 --> 01:51:38.159 align:start position:0%
anymore
 
01:51:40.070 --> 01:51:40.080 align:start position:0%
for the record
 
01:51:42.310 --> 01:51:42.320 align:start position:0%
you may not have a federal tribe here
 
01:51:44.870 --> 01:51:44.880 align:start position:0%
but in 1995
 
01:51:46.310 --> 01:51:46.320 align:start position:0%
our band petitioned the federal
 
01:51:47.830 --> 01:51:47.840 align:start position:0%
government we're on record with the
 
01:51:49.910 --> 01:51:49.920 align:start position:0%
bureau of indian affairs
 
01:51:49.920 --> 01:51:51.109 align:start position:0%
bureau of indian affairs
the

01:51:51.109 --> 01:51:51.119 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:51:53.109 --> 01:51:53.119 align:start position:0%
secretary of state and the attorney
 
01:51:54.950 --> 01:51:54.960 align:start position:0%
general of this state know we are
 
01:51:56.950 --> 01:51:56.960 align:start position:0%
headquartered here in alton and it's
 
01:51:59.910 --> 01:51:59.920 align:start position:0%
been on record uh for quite a few years
 
01:52:02.629 --> 01:52:02.639 align:start position:0%
so the idea that there's no indian
 
01:52:04.950 --> 01:52:04.960 align:start position:0%
tribes as you guys would like to say is
 
01:52:06.950 --> 01:52:06.960 align:start position:0%
false we are headquartered here we've
 
01:52:09.030 --> 01:52:09.040 align:start position:0%
always been here and we've been kind of
 
01:52:10.790 --> 01:52:10.800 align:start position:0%
invisible to most of you
 
01:52:13.750 --> 01:52:13.760 align:start position:0%
as you can tell by the testimony today
 
01:52:15.270 --> 01:52:15.280 align:start position:0%
i mean we could answer a lot of your
 
01:52:17.669 --> 01:52:17.679 align:start position:0%
questions i think the package we've
 
01:52:19.910 --> 01:52:19.920 align:start position:0%
handed out really covers a lot of the
 
01:52:22.629 --> 01:52:22.639 align:start position:0%
history how mascots were actually
 
01:52:22.639 --> 01:52:23.910 align:start position:0%
history how mascots were actually
evolved

01:52:23.910 --> 01:52:23.920 align:start position:0%
evolved
 
01:52:25.910 --> 01:52:25.920 align:start position:0%
out of the boston tea party
 
01:52:28.709 --> 01:52:28.719 align:start position:0%
uh you know the raid on the on the ships
 
01:52:30.390 --> 01:52:30.400 align:start position:0%
for the tea
 
01:52:33.430 --> 01:52:33.440 align:start position:0%
back and that became a real uh changing
 
01:52:35.510 --> 01:52:35.520 align:start position:0%
moment in our country where
 
01:52:37.750 --> 01:52:37.760 align:start position:0%
indigenous imagery was used for the
 
01:52:39.510 --> 01:52:39.520 align:start position:0%
benefit of politics
 
01:52:41.350 --> 01:52:41.360 align:start position:0%
and that evolved into fraternal
 
01:52:43.350 --> 01:52:43.360 align:start position:0%
organizations and a lot of hobbyists and
 
01:52:44.870 --> 01:52:44.880 align:start position:0%
other things
 
01:52:46.149 --> 01:52:46.159 align:start position:0%
i can answer the question about
 
01:52:47.669 --> 01:52:47.679 align:start position:0%
dartmouth dartmouth
 
01:52:49.589 --> 01:52:49.599 align:start position:0%
is really a
 
01:52:51.669 --> 01:52:51.679 align:start position:0%
a very difficult history
 
01:52:53.510 --> 01:52:53.520 align:start position:0%
unknown to most people
 
01:52:55.510 --> 01:52:55.520 align:start position:0%
uh they kind of glorified indigenous
 
01:52:57.910 --> 01:52:57.920 align:start position:0%
people they were smoking rooms like this
 
01:53:00.149 --> 01:53:00.159 align:start position:0%
in dartmouth were where scenes were
 
01:53:02.870 --> 01:53:02.880 align:start position:0%
painted of indigenous women in bailly
 
01:53:04.229 --> 01:53:04.239 align:start position:0%
any clothing
 
01:53:05.990 --> 01:53:06.000 align:start position:0%
and that's where the boys used to sit
 
01:53:09.030 --> 01:53:09.040 align:start position:0%
and drink and you know smoke the cigars
 
01:53:11.109 --> 01:53:11.119 align:start position:0%
dartmouth had to change their philosophy
 
01:53:13.109 --> 01:53:13.119 align:start position:0%
they were in indian school
 
01:53:14.709 --> 01:53:14.719 align:start position:0%
but they really didn't honor any
 
01:53:16.870 --> 01:53:16.880 align:start position:0%
indigenous people in this state they
 
01:53:17.990 --> 01:53:18.000 align:start position:0%
never did
 
01:53:18.000 --> 01:53:18.870 align:start position:0%
never did
they

01:53:18.870 --> 01:53:18.880 align:start position:0%
they
 
01:53:20.470 --> 01:53:20.480 align:start position:0%
when everybody says oh well they brought
 
01:53:23.030 --> 01:53:23.040 align:start position:0%
in indians in to endorse things at
 
01:53:25.510 --> 01:53:25.520 align:start position:0%
dartmouth they never engaged anybody in
 
01:53:26.950 --> 01:53:26.960 align:start position:0%
new england
 
01:53:28.310 --> 01:53:28.320 align:start position:0%
if you actually look at the record
 
01:53:30.870 --> 01:53:30.880 align:start position:0%
you'll see how many uh how few people
 
01:53:32.550 --> 01:53:32.560 align:start position:0%
dartmouth actually graduated with
 
01:53:34.950 --> 01:53:34.960 align:start position:0%
indigenous descent it wasn't until after
 
01:53:36.629 --> 01:53:36.639 align:start position:0%
the retirement of the mascots and the
 
01:53:38.390 --> 01:53:38.400 align:start position:0%
removal of the offensive sexually
 
01:53:41.350 --> 01:53:41.360 align:start position:0%
explicit murals that were done in the
 
01:53:43.830 --> 01:53:43.840 align:start position:0%
school halls um that dartmouth decided
 
01:53:45.350 --> 01:53:45.360 align:start position:0%
to take the bull by the horns and
 
01:53:48.550 --> 01:53:48.560 align:start position:0%
actually fulfill its its initial contact
 
01:53:50.149 --> 01:53:50.159 align:start position:0%
and then so they started offering
 
01:53:52.149 --> 01:53:52.159 align:start position:0%
scholarships and other um
 
01:53:55.109 --> 01:53:55.119 align:start position:0%
benefits to uh uplift the indigenous
 
01:53:57.510 --> 01:53:57.520 align:start position:0%
population the abner and the related
 
01:53:59.030 --> 01:53:59.040 align:start position:0%
tribes in new england still are
 
01:54:01.830 --> 01:54:01.840 align:start position:0%
marginalized by dotnet even today so i
 
01:54:03.430 --> 01:54:03.440 align:start position:0%
don't want to go down to you know i
 
01:54:04.709 --> 01:54:04.719 align:start position:0%
don't want to get into the weeds on that
 
01:54:07.189 --> 01:54:07.199 align:start position:0%
but that's another sore subject with us
 
01:54:09.510 --> 01:54:09.520 align:start position:0%
mascots are not just a problem it's all
 
01:54:11.189 --> 01:54:11.199 align:start position:0%
the other imagery
 
01:54:14.070 --> 01:54:14.080 align:start position:0%
things of violence tomahawks uh tomahawk
 
01:54:15.510 --> 01:54:15.520 align:start position:0%
chops uh
 
01:54:17.750 --> 01:54:17.760 align:start position:0%
uh cheerleaders dressing and skimpy are
 
01:54:19.189 --> 01:54:19.199 align:start position:0%
tired trying to
 
01:54:20.950 --> 01:54:20.960 align:start position:0%
make some kind of costume that looks
 
01:54:22.709 --> 01:54:22.719 align:start position:0%
like an indigenous thing these are the
 
01:54:24.790 --> 01:54:24.800 align:start position:0%
things we see still going on right and
 
01:54:27.270 --> 01:54:27.280 align:start position:0%
these all be all these behaviors um
 
01:54:28.870 --> 01:54:28.880 align:start position:0%
contribute to the missing and murdered
 
01:54:30.629 --> 01:54:30.639 align:start position:0%
indigenous women problem that we're
 
01:54:33.109 --> 01:54:33.119 align:start position:0%
suffering across this nation and canada
 
01:54:35.589 --> 01:54:35.599 align:start position:0%
we are disappearing by the thousands
 
01:54:37.910 --> 01:54:37.920 align:start position:0%
because we're considered sub-human
 
01:54:40.470 --> 01:54:40.480 align:start position:0%
so we sit here today praying that you
 
01:54:43.430 --> 01:54:43.440 align:start position:0%
decide to see us as human beings and we
 
01:54:46.870 --> 01:54:46.880 align:start position:0%
and stop the use of these mascots
 
01:54:48.709 --> 01:54:48.719 align:start position:0%
i mean if you go through what we've
 
01:54:50.390 --> 01:54:50.400 align:start position:0%
given you for some handout information
 
01:54:52.870 --> 01:54:52.880 align:start position:0%
you'll see the 2002
 
01:54:55.109 --> 01:54:55.119 align:start position:0%
uh department of education memorandum
 
01:54:57.350 --> 01:54:57.360 align:start position:0%
what we think is it should have been uh
 
01:55:00.070 --> 01:55:00.080 align:start position:0%
made into law back then in 2002 and it's
 
01:55:01.910 --> 01:55:01.920 align:start position:0%
a shame that it's 20 years later we're
 
01:55:04.229 --> 01:55:04.239 align:start position:0%
still talking about the subject matter
 
01:55:05.830 --> 01:55:05.840 align:start position:0%
will it be resistance there's always
 
01:55:08.470 --> 01:55:08.480 align:start position:0%
resistance i'm like dave miller i'm in
 
01:55:11.030 --> 01:55:11.040 align:start position:0%
my my 70s he's probably 80 now i can't
 
01:55:13.109 --> 01:55:13.119 align:start position:0%
remember how old he is we've seen a lot
 
01:55:15.430 --> 01:55:15.440 align:start position:0%
of things change socially and racially
 
01:55:18.390 --> 01:55:18.400 align:start position:0%
you know we we baby boomers after world
 
01:55:21.030 --> 01:55:21.040 align:start position:0%
war ii a lot of things which we accepted
 
01:55:23.030 --> 01:55:23.040 align:start position:0%
back then are not acceptable today and
 
01:55:25.270 --> 01:55:25.280 align:start position:0%
we would never even imagine it you we've
 
01:55:27.189 --> 01:55:27.199 align:start position:0%
heard about the seminoles that's great
 
01:55:29.510 --> 01:55:29.520 align:start position:0%
the seminoles get actually financial
 
01:55:31.990 --> 01:55:32.000 align:start position:0%
benefit by using their name most other
 
01:55:34.310 --> 01:55:34.320 align:start position:0%
tribes do not have that relationship
 
01:55:36.310 --> 01:55:36.320 align:start position:0%
just so you understand
 
01:55:37.830 --> 01:55:37.840 align:start position:0%
that there are groups out there that
 
01:55:40.070 --> 01:55:40.080 align:start position:0%
would love to say mascots are great but
 
01:55:41.990 --> 01:55:42.000 align:start position:0%
every time we investigate what goes on
 
01:55:43.669 --> 01:55:43.679 align:start position:0%
in these schools
 
01:55:45.750 --> 01:55:45.760 align:start position:0%
they'll say chief so-and-so came to our
 
01:55:48.709 --> 01:55:48.719 align:start position:0%
town in 1970 and said it was all right
 
01:55:50.550 --> 01:55:50.560 align:start position:0%
we do the research and these people were
 
01:55:52.790 --> 01:55:52.800 align:start position:0%
not indigenous people at all they were
 
01:55:54.870 --> 01:55:54.880 align:start position:0%
just people that were playing the game
 
01:55:57.030 --> 01:55:57.040 align:start position:0%
and then trying to convince the town it
 
01:55:59.189 --> 01:55:59.199 align:start position:0%
was all right so we found after we've
 
01:56:01.430 --> 01:56:01.440 align:start position:0%
done a lot of research on all the the
 
01:56:03.109 --> 01:56:03.119 align:start position:0%
background of these towns
 
01:56:05.189 --> 01:56:05.199 align:start position:0%
there's is a false sense that they did
 
01:56:06.950 --> 01:56:06.960 align:start position:0%
things right they didn't they looked for
 
01:56:08.390 --> 01:56:08.400 align:start position:0%
the easy way out
 
01:56:11.189 --> 01:56:11.199 align:start position:0%
we worked with uh locally here merrimack
 
01:56:13.030 --> 01:56:13.040 align:start position:0%
uh valley
 
01:56:13.040 --> 01:56:13.750 align:start position:0%
uh valley
to high school

01:56:13.750 --> 01:56:13.760 align:start position:0%
to high school
 
01:56:15.189 --> 01:56:15.199 align:start position:0%
school would i cut it
 
01:56:17.430 --> 01:56:17.440 align:start position:0%
um both have have had their names their
 
01:56:19.510 --> 01:56:19.520 align:start position:0%
mascots changed
 
01:56:21.030 --> 01:56:21.040 align:start position:0%
when akanet is in the process of
 
01:56:23.910 --> 01:56:23.920 align:start position:0%
creating a video dot mini documentary
 
01:56:26.149 --> 01:56:26.159 align:start position:0%
about that process change and about how
 
01:56:28.390 --> 01:56:28.400 align:start position:0%
it affected the community and about why
 
01:56:31.109 --> 01:56:31.119 align:start position:0%
it was necessary so this is about
 
01:56:33.109 --> 01:56:33.119 align:start position:0%
education it's about the betterment of
 
01:56:35.109 --> 01:56:35.119 align:start position:0%
society and it's about treating people
 
01:56:36.390 --> 01:56:36.400 align:start position:0%
as equals
 
01:56:38.470 --> 01:56:38.480 align:start position:0%
so we're going to stop here because we
 
01:56:40.149 --> 01:56:40.159 align:start position:0%
could go on for hours because we get
 
01:56:42.310 --> 01:56:42.320 align:start position:0%
really emotional when it comes to the
 
01:56:45.830 --> 01:56:45.840 align:start position:0%
subject but we ask you today to pass
 
01:56:45.840 --> 01:56:48.070 align:start position:0%
subject but we ask you today to pass
1261

01:56:48.070 --> 01:56:48.080 align:start position:0%
1261
 
01:56:50.950 --> 01:56:50.960 align:start position:0%
and we don't see where they would be
 
01:56:53.109 --> 01:56:53.119 align:start position:0%
discord on either side where this is
 
01:56:55.430 --> 01:56:55.440 align:start position:0%
already a lot in effect today
 
01:56:57.350 --> 01:56:57.360 align:start position:0%
thank you just for the record though we
 
01:57:01.030 --> 01:57:01.040 align:start position:0%
do not impose our will on towns
 
01:57:03.589 --> 01:57:03.599 align:start position:0%
we are usually react to uh petitions
 
01:57:05.910 --> 01:57:05.920 align:start position:0%
from students and then we come into the
 
01:57:07.830 --> 01:57:07.840 align:start position:0%

01:57:10.550 --> 01:57:10.560 align:start position:0%

representative lakers please
 
01:57:16.550 --> 01:57:16.560 align:start position:0%
yeah i just the last thing that you said
 
01:57:16.560 --> 01:57:18.790 align:start position:0%
yeah i just the last thing that you said
um

01:57:18.790 --> 01:57:18.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:57:22.629 --> 01:57:22.639 align:start position:0%
that the students petition is that not
 
01:57:26.070 --> 01:57:26.080 align:start position:0%
a reasonable way to go about this i just
 
01:57:28.470 --> 01:57:28.480 align:start position:0%
hadn't heard that until you just said it
 
01:57:30.229 --> 01:57:30.239 align:start position:0%
students petitioned
 
01:57:32.790 --> 01:57:32.800 align:start position:0%
in all the schools that we interact with
 
01:57:34.870 --> 01:57:34.880 align:start position:0%
um and so the students come forward
 
01:57:37.510 --> 01:57:37.520 align:start position:0%
requesting that the mascot be removed we
 
01:57:39.030 --> 01:57:39.040 align:start position:0%
meet with school boards and other
 
01:57:40.790 --> 01:57:40.800 align:start position:0%
interested parties and have the long
 
01:57:43.990 --> 01:57:44.000 align:start position:0%
lengthy emotional discussions
 
01:57:45.030 --> 01:57:45.040 align:start position:0%
the last
 
01:57:47.109 --> 01:57:47.119 align:start position:0%
time we had this conversation was in
 
01:57:49.750 --> 01:57:49.760 align:start position:0%
rochester at spaulding high school a
 
01:57:52.070 --> 01:57:52.080 align:start position:0%
student came forward because she was
 
01:57:53.910 --> 01:57:53.920 align:start position:0%
being bullied
 
01:57:55.750 --> 01:57:55.760 align:start position:0%
and went in front of the school board
 
01:57:58.149 --> 01:57:58.159 align:start position:0%
making the request the school board told
 
01:58:00.629 --> 01:58:00.639 align:start position:0%
her to go talk to her guidance counselor
 
01:58:03.109 --> 01:58:03.119 align:start position:0%
that they don't tolerate bullying and
 
01:58:04.550 --> 01:58:04.560 align:start position:0%
that there's nothing they could do for
 
01:58:04.560 --> 01:58:05.350 align:start position:0%
that there's nothing they could do for
her

01:58:05.350 --> 01:58:05.360 align:start position:0%
her
 
01:58:07.830 --> 01:58:07.840 align:start position:0%
thank you so it was frustrating but i
 
01:58:09.510 --> 01:58:09.520 align:start position:0%
can also state that
 
01:58:12.870 --> 01:58:12.880 align:start position:0%
i do know of at least two students where
 
01:58:15.270 --> 01:58:15.280 align:start position:0%
schools within the state had to pay to
 
01:58:17.589 --> 01:58:17.599 align:start position:0%
ship them outside their district because
 
01:58:19.750 --> 01:58:19.760 align:start position:0%
of the school mascots and their bullying
 
01:58:22.310 --> 01:58:22.320 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very much um
 
01:58:25.990 --> 01:58:26.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:26.000 --> 01:58:27.430 align:start position:0%
 
yes

01:58:27.430 --> 01:58:27.440 align:start position:0%

thank you for being your comment in the
 
01:58:33.350 --> 01:58:33.360 align:start position:0%
question possible follow-up uh i i've
 
01:58:33.360 --> 01:58:34.870 align:start position:0%
question possible follow-up uh i i've
taught

01:58:34.870 --> 01:58:34.880 align:start position:0%
taught
 
01:58:36.950 --> 01:58:36.960 align:start position:0%
yes question uh
 
01:58:40.629 --> 01:58:40.639 align:start position:0%
is that given that there is a difference
 
01:58:43.270 --> 01:58:43.280 align:start position:0%
between symbols and nicknames and
 
01:58:45.430 --> 01:58:45.440 align:start position:0%
mascots and and i keep hearing mascot
 
01:58:48.790 --> 01:58:48.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:50.629 --> 01:58:50.639 align:start position:0%
what do you say to the folks and i said
 
01:58:52.950 --> 01:58:52.960 align:start position:0%
earlier sports illustrated polls said 80
 
01:58:54.550 --> 01:58:54.560 align:start position:0%
percent of native americans in their
 
01:58:57.270 --> 01:58:57.280 align:start position:0%
polls supported the the way that symbols
 
01:58:59.750 --> 01:58:59.760 align:start position:0%
and nicknames not mascots which you keep
 
01:59:02.070 --> 01:59:02.080 align:start position:0%
referring to but symbols and nicknames
 
01:59:02.080 --> 01:59:03.109 align:start position:0%
referring to but symbols and nicknames
honor

01:59:03.109 --> 01:59:03.119 align:start position:0%
honor
 
01:59:06.070 --> 01:59:06.080 align:start position:0%
uh affiliations with indigenous people
 
01:59:07.510 --> 01:59:07.520 align:start position:0%
given there are so many people not
 
01:59:09.589 --> 01:59:09.599 align:start position:0%
activists but so many native americans
 
01:59:12.229 --> 01:59:12.239 align:start position:0%
who are not here but who
 
01:59:13.990 --> 01:59:14.000 align:start position:0%
celebrate this connection what do you
 
01:59:15.109 --> 01:59:15.119 align:start position:0%
say to them
 
01:59:17.990 --> 01:59:18.000 align:start position:0%
my question is is who's taking the poll
 
01:59:20.229 --> 01:59:20.239 align:start position:0%
and who are they polling and are they
 
01:59:22.229 --> 01:59:22.239 align:start position:0%
registered with an indigenous tribe or
 
01:59:24.390 --> 01:59:24.400 align:start position:0%
are they just claiming descendancy
 
01:59:26.390 --> 01:59:26.400 align:start position:0%
um there are a lot of varying factors
 
01:59:27.589 --> 01:59:27.599 align:start position:0%
within this
 
01:59:30.790 --> 01:59:30.800 align:start position:0%
and um i ha have not seen the poll i
 
01:59:32.470 --> 01:59:32.480 align:start position:0%
don't know where the poll was conducted
 
01:59:34.310 --> 01:59:34.320 align:start position:0%
i don't know who the poll was conducted
 
01:59:36.550 --> 01:59:36.560 align:start position:0%
with was it just with sports stands of
 
01:59:38.950 --> 01:59:38.960 align:start position:0%
these particular sports teams
 
01:59:41.109 --> 01:59:41.119 align:start position:0%
so i mean there's a lot of questions so
 
01:59:43.109 --> 01:59:43.119 align:start position:0%
i question the authenticity of the poll
 
01:59:44.870 --> 01:59:44.880 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
01:59:47.750 --> 01:59:47.760 align:start position:0%

hi my name is jonathan weinberg i'm a
 
02:00:11.669 --> 02:00:11.679 align:start position:0%
member of the concord school board
 
02:00:13.270 --> 02:00:13.280 align:start position:0%
however i'm speaking my capacity as an
 
02:00:15.750 --> 02:00:15.760 align:start position:0%
individual i want to illuminate some
 
02:00:17.350 --> 02:00:17.360 align:start position:0%
ideas actually that was in reference to
 
02:00:19.350 --> 02:00:19.360 align:start position:0%
the sports illustrated poll
 
02:00:20.870 --> 02:00:20.880 align:start position:0%
it was taken
 
02:00:22.629 --> 02:00:22.639 align:start position:0%
from 504
 
02:00:22.639 --> 02:00:23.990 align:start position:0%
from 504
respondents

02:00:23.990 --> 02:00:24.000 align:start position:0%
respondents
 
02:00:26.950 --> 02:00:26.960 align:start position:0%
about 51 said they were pro football
 
02:00:29.430 --> 02:00:29.440 align:start position:0%
fans and they were all self-identified
 
02:00:32.310 --> 02:00:32.320 align:start position:0%
members of native american tribes
 
02:00:34.470 --> 02:00:34.480 align:start position:0%
uh moreover it is easy to say where we
 
02:00:36.629 --> 02:00:36.639 align:start position:0%
get statistics from there's another
 
02:00:38.709 --> 02:00:38.719 align:start position:0%
berkeley poll that says about 70 of
 
02:00:38.719 --> 02:00:40.790 align:start position:0%
berkeley poll that says about 70 of
individuals

02:00:40.790 --> 02:00:40.800 align:start position:0%
individuals
 
02:00:40.800 --> 02:00:41.910 align:start position:0%
individuals
oppose

02:00:41.910 --> 02:00:41.920 align:start position:0%
oppose
 
02:00:44.629 --> 02:00:44.639 align:start position:0%
mascots and symbols so
 
02:00:46.629 --> 02:00:46.639 align:start position:0%
just like any group of individuals
 
02:00:48.470 --> 02:00:48.480 align:start position:0%
individuals are not a monolith and also
 
02:00:50.790 --> 02:00:50.800 align:start position:0%
we need to make sure we
 
02:00:53.350 --> 02:00:53.360 align:start position:0%
recognize where sources come from
 
02:00:53.360 --> 02:00:54.629 align:start position:0%
recognize where sources come from
i

02:00:54.629 --> 02:00:54.639 align:start position:0%
i
 
02:00:57.830 --> 02:00:57.840 align:start position:0%
think it is beyond time that we pass
 
02:01:00.470 --> 02:01:00.480 align:start position:0%
house bill 1261
 
02:01:04.310 --> 02:01:04.320 align:start position:0%
as a member of a local school district i
 
02:01:06.550 --> 02:01:06.560 align:start position:0%
cannot imagine
 
02:01:09.430 --> 02:01:09.440 align:start position:0%
going to school and
 
02:01:12.870 --> 02:01:12.880 align:start position:0%
having derogatory symbols uh radiate and
 
02:01:14.709 --> 02:01:14.719 align:start position:0%
permeate through the buildings so i urge
 
02:01:17.189 --> 02:01:17.199 align:start position:0%
you to pass this legislation thank you
 
02:01:19.510 --> 02:01:19.520 align:start position:0%

messages from our youth group we talked
 
02:01:58.550 --> 02:01:58.560 align:start position:0%
about this bill last night at our
 
02:02:01.589 --> 02:02:01.599 align:start position:0%
meeting they strongly support it
 
02:02:03.669 --> 02:02:03.679 align:start position:0%
and i'm just going to read a statement
 
02:02:06.470 --> 02:02:06.480 align:start position:0%
here so they want school mascots in
 
02:02:08.229 --> 02:02:08.239 align:start position:0%
their state to represent their
 
02:02:08.239 --> 02:02:09.430 align:start position:0%
their state to represent their
generation

02:02:09.430 --> 02:02:09.440 align:start position:0%
generation
 
02:02:11.270 --> 02:02:11.280 align:start position:0%
one that they see as respectful
 
02:02:13.990 --> 02:02:14.000 align:start position:0%
compassionate and inclusive and one that
 
02:02:15.589 --> 02:02:15.599 align:start position:0%
they can be proud of
 
02:02:17.510 --> 02:02:17.520 align:start position:0%
this bill is for them
 
02:02:19.510 --> 02:02:19.520 align:start position:0%
and the type of future and legacy they
 
02:02:21.510 --> 02:02:21.520 align:start position:0%
want to be a part of so i just wanted to
 
02:02:24.390 --> 02:02:24.400 align:start position:0%
put that in the record
 
02:02:26.229 --> 02:02:26.239 align:start position:0%

can't students this just happened from
 
02:02:33.510 --> 02:02:33.520 align:start position:0%

02:02:35.510 --> 02:02:35.520 align:start position:0%
what a burden we're asking for youth who
 
02:02:37.830 --> 02:02:37.840 align:start position:0%
are already going through so much these
 
02:02:39.910 --> 02:02:39.920 align:start position:0%
days in schools with kovid to now put
 
02:02:43.669 --> 02:02:43.679 align:start position:0%
another responsibility on them and i ask
 
02:02:46.790 --> 02:02:46.800 align:start position:0%
you to instead see yourselves as models
 
02:02:50.550 --> 02:02:50.560 align:start position:0%
of what we can be and uh so
 
02:02:52.950 --> 02:02:52.960 align:start position:0%
be somebody the students can look up to
 
02:02:55.189 --> 02:02:55.199 align:start position:0%
and see what their future is and how
 
02:02:55.199 --> 02:02:55.910 align:start position:0%
and see what their future is and how
they

02:02:55.910 --> 02:02:55.920 align:start position:0%
they
 
02:02:57.990 --> 02:02:58.000 align:start position:0%
would like that their legacy to be
 
02:03:00.709 --> 02:03:00.719 align:start position:0%

brief i know you guys are starting to um
 
02:06:01.430 --> 02:06:01.440 align:start position:0%
to fall behind on um
 
02:06:03.430 --> 02:06:03.440 align:start position:0%
on kind of your schedule so in respect
 
02:06:05.030 --> 02:06:05.040 align:start position:0%
to time um
 
02:06:06.950 --> 02:06:06.960 align:start position:0%
i have about
 
02:06:09.030 --> 02:06:09.040 align:start position:0%
i'll go over the the um kind of the
 
02:06:11.030 --> 02:06:11.040 align:start position:0%
broadest points um
 
02:06:11.040 --> 02:06:11.990 align:start position:0%
broadest points um
so

02:06:11.990 --> 02:06:12.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:06:13.510 --> 02:06:13.520 align:start position:0%
the purpose of this legislation is to
 
02:06:15.030 --> 02:06:15.040 align:start position:0%
provide every student in hampshire the
 
02:06:16.950 --> 02:06:16.960 align:start position:0%
same opportunity breakfast in the
 
02:06:19.270 --> 02:06:19.280 align:start position:0%
morning not every student is provided
 
02:06:20.790 --> 02:06:20.800 align:start position:0%
that same opportunity in every school
 
02:06:20.800 --> 02:06:21.910 align:start position:0%
that same opportunity in every school
district

02:06:21.910 --> 02:06:21.920 align:start position:0%
district
 
02:06:23.830 --> 02:06:23.840 align:start position:0%
from a phys from a philosophical point
 
02:06:25.830 --> 02:06:25.840 align:start position:0%
of view i believe every student deserves
 
02:06:28.229 --> 02:06:28.239 align:start position:0%
the same opportunity to be able to have
 
02:06:30.790 --> 02:06:30.800 align:start position:0%
the same educational um
 
02:06:32.470 --> 02:06:32.480 align:start position:0%
the same educational outcomes and i
 
02:06:33.910 --> 02:06:33.920 align:start position:0%
think breakfast is an important part of
 
02:06:35.430 --> 02:06:35.440 align:start position:0%
that and as previously discussed in
 
02:06:37.109 --> 02:06:37.119 align:start position:0%
previous testimony that i've given
 
02:06:39.350 --> 02:06:39.360 align:start position:0%
there's a you know myriad of benefits to
 
02:06:41.189 --> 02:06:41.199 align:start position:0%
our to the students to the educational
 
02:06:43.430 --> 02:06:43.440 align:start position:0%
system in our society when we do such a
 
02:06:45.910 --> 02:06:45.920 align:start position:0%
thing um i could read you the facts from
 
02:06:47.910 --> 02:06:47.920 align:start position:0%
the usda and the school breakfast
 
02:06:49.350 --> 02:06:49.360 align:start position:0%
program but i'll just submit it to the
 
02:06:51.270 --> 02:06:51.280 align:start position:0%
clerk to promulgate to you guys at a
 
02:06:53.990 --> 02:06:54.000 align:start position:0%
later time i have an amendment that i've
 
02:06:55.830 --> 02:06:55.840 align:start position:0%
drafted for the committee to consider
 
02:06:57.350 --> 02:06:57.360 align:start position:0%
which would exempt private schools and
 
02:06:59.750 --> 02:06:59.760 align:start position:0%
only make it so it's required for
 
02:06:59.760 --> 02:07:00.470 align:start position:0%
only make it so it's required for
for

02:07:00.470 --> 02:07:00.480 align:start position:0%
for
 
02:07:02.390 --> 02:07:02.400 align:start position:0%
school boards or publicly chartered
 
02:07:05.189 --> 02:07:05.199 align:start position:0%
schools it would also provide an am an
 
02:07:08.550 --> 02:07:08.560 align:start position:0%
exemption for uh for any kind of issue
 
02:07:09.340 --> 02:07:09.350 align:start position:0%
regarding um
 
02:07:09.350 --> 02:07:11.510 align:start position:0%
regarding um
[Music]

02:07:11.510 --> 02:07:11.520 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:07:12.790 --> 02:07:12.800 align:start position:0%
supply chain
 
02:07:15.510 --> 02:07:15.520 align:start position:0%
uh due to copen 19 pandemic so i'll
 
02:07:17.830 --> 02:07:17.840 align:start position:0%
submit that to the clerk too with my
 
02:07:19.910 --> 02:07:19.920 align:start position:0%
testimony um
 
02:07:21.189 --> 02:07:21.199 align:start position:0%
the probably the biggest concern that'll
 
02:07:23.350 --> 02:07:23.360 align:start position:0%
be brought up is a loss of local control
 
02:07:24.870 --> 02:07:24.880 align:start position:0%
i think we've kind of discussed that you
 
02:07:26.950 --> 02:07:26.960 align:start position:0%
know at times government this state
 
02:07:28.709 --> 02:07:28.719 align:start position:0%
government steps in as a dylan rule
 
02:07:30.870 --> 02:07:30.880 align:start position:0%
state and decides to create guard rails
 
02:07:32.629 --> 02:07:32.639 align:start position:0%
for specific expectations to meet the
 
02:07:34.629 --> 02:07:34.639 align:start position:0%
needs of constituents and specifically
 
02:07:36.229 --> 02:07:36.239 align:start position:0%
students in this case
 
02:07:38.069 --> 02:07:38.079 align:start position:0%
the concern of an unfunded mandate may
 
02:07:39.589 --> 02:07:39.599 align:start position:0%
come up if i'm not mistaken the
 
02:07:41.430 --> 02:07:41.440 align:start position:0%
legislation does go into effect after
 
02:07:44.310 --> 02:07:44.320 align:start position:0%
the next budget season
 
02:07:45.589 --> 02:07:45.599 align:start position:0%
let me double check to make sure that
 
02:07:48.149 --> 02:07:48.159 align:start position:0%
i'm not misleading the the committee on
 
02:07:48.159 --> 02:07:49.189 align:start position:0%
i'm not misleading the the committee on
that

02:07:49.189 --> 02:07:49.199 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:07:52.310 --> 02:07:52.320 align:start position:0%
it does yep correct and so um
 
02:07:54.310 --> 02:07:54.320 align:start position:0%
new hampshire has historically at times
 
02:07:57.109 --> 02:07:57.119 align:start position:0%
reimbursed local local districts for
 
02:07:58.790 --> 02:07:58.800 align:start position:0%
meals or for breakfast if i'm not
 
02:08:01.830 --> 02:08:01.840 align:start position:0%
mistaken the 2013-14 biennium budget
 
02:08:03.910 --> 02:08:03.920 align:start position:0%
reimbursed at about three cents per meal
 
02:08:05.270 --> 02:08:05.280 align:start position:0%
the federal government reimburses at a
 
02:08:07.189 --> 02:08:07.199 align:start position:0%
much larger rate i did provide in the
 
02:08:09.270 --> 02:08:09.280 align:start position:0%
legislation a choice for districts to
 
02:08:10.790 --> 02:08:10.800 align:start position:0%
choose whether or not to serve their own
 
02:08:12.550 --> 02:08:12.560 align:start position:0%
breakfast which would be determine what
 
02:08:14.229 --> 02:08:14.239 align:start position:0%
they decided breakfast could be it could
 
02:08:17.030 --> 02:08:17.040 align:start position:0%
be a bag for you know maybe an apple and
 
02:08:19.030 --> 02:08:19.040 align:start position:0%
a granola bar or they could opt into the
 
02:08:20.950 --> 02:08:20.960 align:start position:0%
federal program and get reimbursed for
 
02:08:23.750 --> 02:08:23.760 align:start position:0%
these meals so trying to preserve an
 
02:08:25.589 --> 02:08:25.599 align:start position:0%
element of local control but also trying
 
02:08:27.510 --> 02:08:27.520 align:start position:0%
to make sure that the state is having
 
02:08:28.950 --> 02:08:28.960 align:start position:0%
our local governments meet the needs of
 
02:08:31.109 --> 02:08:31.119 align:start position:0%
students and the needs of our of our
 
02:08:33.270 --> 02:08:33.280 align:start position:0%
constituents and with that i'll remain
 
02:08:34.950 --> 02:08:34.960 align:start position:0%

are private schools who are part of the
 
02:09:07.109 --> 02:09:07.119 align:start position:0%
federal lunch program
 
02:09:08.790 --> 02:09:08.800 align:start position:0%
i think that would be a better question
 
02:09:10.229 --> 02:09:10.239 align:start position:0%
for the department of education i can
 
02:09:11.270 --> 02:09:11.280 align:start position:0%
find that out for you though and get
 
02:09:13.030 --> 02:09:13.040 align:start position:0%
back to representative porter but i i'm
 
02:09:14.709 --> 02:09:14.719 align:start position:0%
not aware of i've only gone to public
 
02:09:16.950 --> 02:09:16.960 align:start position:0%
schools my entire life follow-up
 
02:09:19.589 --> 02:09:19.599 align:start position:0%
so i'm just curious as to why your
 
02:09:22.629 --> 02:09:22.639 align:start position:0%
amendment would um do away with the
 
02:09:24.709 --> 02:09:24.719 align:start position:0%
private schools requirement
 
02:09:26.470 --> 02:09:26.480 align:start position:0%
i think it was an and this is an
 
02:09:27.990 --> 02:09:28.000 align:start position:0%
amendment i'm also crafting the same
 
02:09:30.390 --> 02:09:30.400 align:start position:0%
thing for house bill 1561
 
02:09:32.870 --> 02:09:32.880 align:start position:0%
uh and the purpose being private schools
 
02:09:35.669 --> 02:09:35.679 align:start position:0%
i think they they we should we shouldn't
 
02:09:37.750 --> 02:09:37.760 align:start position:0%
have when people choose a private option
 
02:09:39.189 --> 02:09:39.199 align:start position:0%
they choose that private option to get
 
02:09:41.910 --> 02:09:41.920 align:start position:0%
away from the government provided option
 
02:09:43.669 --> 02:09:43.679 align:start position:0%
and i like to keep you know the private
 
02:09:46.069 --> 02:09:46.079 align:start position:0%
schools and what what what regulations
 
02:09:47.990 --> 02:09:48.000 align:start position:0%
they have separate from the regulations
 
02:09:50.310 --> 02:09:50.320 align:start position:0%
that we might place upon public schools
 
02:09:51.910 --> 02:09:51.920 align:start position:0%
public schools or within our purview i
 
02:09:53.589 --> 02:09:53.599 align:start position:0%
think i think it's quite clear i think
 
02:09:55.030 --> 02:09:55.040 align:start position:0%
also regarding you know providing an
 
02:09:57.189 --> 02:09:57.199 align:start position:0%
adequate education it's pretty explicit
 
02:09:58.390 --> 02:09:58.400 align:start position:0%
that that
 
02:10:00.390 --> 02:10:00.400 align:start position:0%
must mean public schools so i just
 
02:10:02.229 --> 02:10:02.239 align:start position:0%
wanted to keep that separate let the
 
02:10:03.750 --> 02:10:03.760 align:start position:0%
private schools do what they privately
 
02:10:05.750 --> 02:10:05.760 align:start position:0%
do and let us handle our government
 
02:10:05.760 --> 02:10:07.350 align:start position:0%
do and let us handle our government
schools

02:10:07.350 --> 02:10:07.360 align:start position:0%
schools
 
02:10:09.750 --> 02:10:09.760 align:start position:0%
one last follow-up thank you but now
 
02:10:12.709 --> 02:10:12.719 align:start position:0%
that we have the voucher program private
 
02:10:15.830 --> 02:10:15.840 align:start position:0%
schools are getting our state money
 
02:10:17.589 --> 02:10:17.599 align:start position:0%
so wouldn't we
 
02:10:20.709 --> 02:10:20.719 align:start position:0%
need to have the same rules for them
 
02:10:22.870 --> 02:10:22.880 align:start position:0%
seeing as how it's taxpayer money that's
 
02:10:26.069 --> 02:10:26.079 align:start position:0%
going to the private schools
 
02:10:27.430 --> 02:10:27.440 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you for the question
 
02:10:28.870 --> 02:10:28.880 align:start position:0%
representative um i would like to
 
02:10:30.310 --> 02:10:30.320 align:start position:0%
differentiate with the uh the current
 
02:10:32.390 --> 02:10:32.400 align:start position:0%
efa program which um you know is quite
 
02:10:33.510 --> 02:10:33.520 align:start position:0%
new and i think it's gonna be a great
 
02:10:35.589 --> 02:10:35.599 align:start position:0%
opportunity for many students and uh
 
02:10:37.350 --> 02:10:37.360 align:start position:0%
families um it's not technically a
 
02:10:38.629 --> 02:10:38.639 align:start position:0%
voucher program because we're not
 
02:10:40.229 --> 02:10:40.239 align:start position:0%
providing direct vouchers it's a
 
02:10:41.669 --> 02:10:41.679 align:start position:0%
scholarship organization that's going to
 
02:10:43.589 --> 02:10:43.599 align:start position:0%
be helping operate the money and it's
 
02:10:46.550 --> 02:10:46.560 align:start position:0%
the way where the state is
 
02:10:48.790 --> 02:10:48.800 align:start position:0%
the state is providing money into
 
02:10:51.589 --> 02:10:51.599 align:start position:0%
accounts that are run that are operated
 
02:10:53.109 --> 02:10:53.119 align:start position:0%
and you know presided over by the
 
02:10:55.510 --> 02:10:55.520 align:start position:0%
scholarship organization to the benefit
 
02:10:57.750 --> 02:10:57.760 align:start position:0%
of parents that choose to utilize such
 
02:10:57.760 --> 02:10:58.870 align:start position:0%
of parents that choose to utilize such
program

02:10:58.870 --> 02:10:58.880 align:start position:0%
program
 
02:11:00.390 --> 02:11:00.400 align:start position:0%
if it was a direct voucher program we
 
02:11:01.430 --> 02:11:01.440 align:start position:0%
might be talking about something
 
02:11:03.830 --> 02:11:03.840 align:start position:0%
slightly different but um
 
02:11:05.910 --> 02:11:05.920 align:start position:0%
you know the choice of how parents who
 
02:11:07.350 --> 02:11:07.360 align:start position:0%
opt into this program for their children
 
02:11:09.589 --> 02:11:09.599 align:start position:0%
how they utilize those dollars i don't
 
02:11:10.950 --> 02:11:10.960 align:start position:0%
think that because they're utilizing
 
02:11:12.709 --> 02:11:12.719 align:start position:0%
these dollars to level the playing field
 
02:11:14.229 --> 02:11:14.239 align:start position:0%
that that then should mean private
 
02:11:16.550 --> 02:11:16.560 align:start position:0%
schools have to be um you know tied into
 
02:11:18.149 --> 02:11:18.159 align:start position:0%
every single government school
 
02:11:19.990 --> 02:11:20.000 align:start position:0%
requirement i think part of the reason
 
02:11:21.350 --> 02:11:21.360 align:start position:0%
why they're even utilizing the dollars
 
02:11:22.870 --> 02:11:22.880 align:start position:0%
is because they might have objections
 
02:11:24.310 --> 02:11:24.320 align:start position:0%
some of the government school
 
02:11:26.229 --> 02:11:26.239 align:start position:0%
requirements so that's kind of the
 
02:11:27.910 --> 02:11:27.920 align:start position:0%
reason why i felt as if drawing that
 
02:11:30.550 --> 02:11:30.560 align:start position:0%
kind of line there of saying the private
 
02:11:32.229 --> 02:11:32.239 align:start position:0%
schools will you know they'll do their
 
02:11:33.750 --> 02:11:33.760 align:start position:0%
private school things and there are
 
02:11:35.350 --> 02:11:35.360 align:start position:0%
people who prefer those private school
 
02:11:37.109 --> 02:11:37.119 align:start position:0%
things in the government schools will do
 
02:11:38.229 --> 02:11:38.239 align:start position:0%
those government school things and i
 
02:11:39.430 --> 02:11:39.440 align:start position:0%
think another impetus for why i've
 
02:11:41.189 --> 02:11:41.199 align:start position:0%
introduced some of this legislation is
 
02:11:42.790 --> 02:11:42.800 align:start position:0%
to make our public schools more
 
02:11:44.950 --> 02:11:44.960 align:start position:0%
competitive with private schools right i
 
02:11:46.149 --> 02:11:46.159 align:start position:0%
think that's important i think that's
 
02:11:47.910 --> 02:11:47.920 align:start position:0%
part of the reason why the original
 
02:11:49.189 --> 02:11:49.199 align:start position:0%
education freedom accounts were
 
02:11:50.870 --> 02:11:50.880 align:start position:0%
introduced was to provide some level of
 
02:11:52.950 --> 02:11:52.960 align:start position:0%
competition so that parents can choose
 
02:11:54.870 --> 02:11:54.880 align:start position:0%
the best education for their child and
 
02:11:56.470 --> 02:11:56.480 align:start position:0%
for us as a state and for local school
 
02:11:58.629 --> 02:11:58.639 align:start position:0%
boards to kind of react and say how can
 
02:12:00.790 --> 02:12:00.800 align:start position:0%
we improve our educational standards
 
02:12:01.990 --> 02:12:02.000 align:start position:0%
improve the services that we're
 
02:12:02.000 --> 02:12:03.589 align:start position:0%
improve the services that we're
providing

02:12:03.589 --> 02:12:03.599 align:start position:0%
providing
 
02:12:06.550 --> 02:12:06.560 align:start position:0%
further questions represent like us
 
02:12:09.270 --> 02:12:09.280 align:start position:0%
yes thank you sorry my brain stopped in
 
02:12:12.149 --> 02:12:12.159 align:start position:0%
the middle as asking this question
 
02:12:13.750 --> 02:12:13.760 align:start position:0%
you say that
 
02:12:15.669 --> 02:12:15.679 align:start position:0%
any child who meets the federal income
 
02:12:17.990 --> 02:12:18.000 align:start position:0%
eligibility guidelines
 
02:12:21.270 --> 02:12:21.280 align:start position:0%
my question is what about all of those
 
02:12:23.589 --> 02:12:23.599 align:start position:0%
students who meet that but have their
 
02:12:26.229 --> 02:12:26.239 align:start position:0%
parents haven't applied for the national
 
02:12:28.149 --> 02:12:28.159 align:start position:0%
school breakfast program so they're not
 
02:12:34.870 --> 02:12:34.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:36.470 --> 02:12:36.480 align:start position:0%
i think that's a that's a great question
 
02:12:37.510 --> 02:12:37.520 align:start position:0%
and thank you for asking it
 
02:12:39.510 --> 02:12:39.520 align:start position:0%
representative leckis um i think that
 
02:12:40.870 --> 02:12:40.880 align:start position:0%
would be up to the school district i'm
 
02:12:42.390 --> 02:12:42.400 align:start position:0%
not mistaken to decide whether or not
 
02:12:43.830 --> 02:12:43.840 align:start position:0%
they have those students pay the full
 
02:12:45.109 --> 02:12:45.119 align:start position:0%
price for the breakfast that they're
 
02:12:47.270 --> 02:12:47.280 align:start position:0%
offering for those students or for the
 
02:12:50.149 --> 02:12:50.159 align:start position:0%
school district to cover the cost but
 
02:12:51.990 --> 02:12:52.000 align:start position:0%
that would be at least the way i
 
02:12:53.910 --> 02:12:53.920 align:start position:0%
interpreted and the way i intended for
 
02:12:56.069 --> 02:12:56.079 align:start position:0%
the bill to be interpreted um that it
 
02:12:58.149 --> 02:12:58.159 align:start position:0%
would be a local decision over how much
 
02:12:59.510 --> 02:12:59.520 align:start position:0%
the school district would be willing to
 
02:13:01.510 --> 02:13:01.520 align:start position:0%
cover theoretically they can make it so
 
02:13:02.870 --> 02:13:02.880 align:start position:0%
then the pupil has to cover the full
 
02:13:05.109 --> 02:13:05.119 align:start position:0%
cost of the breakfast
 
02:13:05.119 --> 02:13:06.229 align:start position:0%
cost of the breakfast
represent

02:13:06.229 --> 02:13:06.239 align:start position:0%
represent
 
02:13:08.390 --> 02:13:08.400 align:start position:0%
represent luna we won't have any more
 
02:13:09.669 --> 02:13:09.679 align:start position:0%
follow-ups i'm just going to try to
 
02:13:11.109 --> 02:13:11.119 align:start position:0%
catch up a little bit here
 
02:13:13.270 --> 02:13:13.280 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very much mr mr
 
02:13:14.229 --> 02:13:14.239 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you very much
 
02:13:16.550 --> 02:13:16.560 align:start position:0%
representative uh deschez for bringing
 
02:13:18.870 --> 02:13:18.880 align:start position:0%
this forward would um
 
02:13:21.109 --> 02:13:21.119 align:start position:0%
would 1564
 
02:13:22.709 --> 02:13:22.719 align:start position:0%
apply to
 
02:13:25.669 --> 02:13:25.679 align:start position:0%
let's say pinkerton academy
 
02:13:27.510 --> 02:13:27.520 align:start position:0%
which which i believe is one of the
 
02:13:29.990 --> 02:13:30.000 align:start position:0%
largest providers of public public
 
02:13:32.390 --> 02:13:32.400 align:start position:0%
education services in the state yeah
 
02:13:36.870 --> 02:13:36.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:39.030 --> 02:13:39.040 align:start position:0%
i would i would say probably not because
 
02:13:40.069 --> 02:13:40.079 align:start position:0%
it's a private school if i'm not
 
02:13:40.079 --> 02:13:41.830 align:start position:0%
it's a private school if i'm not
mistaken

02:13:41.830 --> 02:13:41.840 align:start position:0%
mistaken
 
02:13:43.669 --> 02:13:43.679 align:start position:0%
so i would say it's not a requirement
 
02:13:45.910 --> 02:13:45.920 align:start position:0%
for pinkerton and i think pinkerton has
 
02:13:49.189 --> 02:13:49.199 align:start position:0%
decided to stay as a private entity um
 
02:13:50.790 --> 02:13:50.800 align:start position:0%
for a number of reasons that those
 
02:13:52.550 --> 02:13:52.560 align:start position:0%
communities have wanted to have it that
 
02:13:54.470 --> 02:13:54.480 align:start position:0%
way and i think for that reason they've
 
02:13:56.709 --> 02:13:56.719 align:start position:0%
decided to um you know there's a number
 
02:13:58.229 --> 02:13:58.239 align:start position:0%
of things where they're not subject to a
 
02:13:59.510 --> 02:13:59.520 align:start position:0%
number of uh
 
02:14:01.990 --> 02:14:02.000 align:start position:0%
state federal and even you know other
 
02:14:02.000 --> 02:14:03.270 align:start position:0%
state federal and even you know other
requirements

02:14:03.270 --> 02:14:03.280 align:start position:0%
requirements
 
02:14:05.270 --> 02:14:05.280 align:start position:0%
so i kind of think it's fair in this
 
02:14:07.510 --> 02:14:07.520 align:start position:0%
legislation to respect that and for the
 
02:14:08.790 --> 02:14:08.800 align:start position:0%
amendments and i'm bringing forth for
 
02:14:10.390 --> 02:14:10.400 align:start position:0%
other bills that have introduced this
 
02:14:12.629 --> 02:14:12.639 align:start position:0%
committee to respect that decision i'd
 
02:14:14.470 --> 02:14:14.480 align:start position:0%
like to interject just for a second
 
02:14:14.480 --> 02:14:15.350 align:start position:0%
like to interject just for a second
please

02:14:15.350 --> 02:14:15.360 align:start position:0%
please
 
02:14:17.430 --> 02:14:17.440 align:start position:0%
uh we have pinkerton academy and st
 
02:14:19.109 --> 02:14:19.119 align:start position:0%
johnsbury academy where kids from new
 
02:14:21.270 --> 02:14:21.280 align:start position:0%
hampshire go even though cj is over in
 
02:14:23.669 --> 02:14:23.679 align:start position:0%
vermont they're independent schools
 
02:14:25.510 --> 02:14:25.520 align:start position:0%
that means they're partially public and
 
02:14:25.520 --> 02:14:26.550 align:start position:0%
that means they're partially public and
private

02:14:26.550 --> 02:14:26.560 align:start position:0%
private
 
02:14:30.470 --> 02:14:30.480 align:start position:0%
and their boards are appointed trustees
 
02:14:30.480 --> 02:14:31.669 align:start position:0%
and their boards are appointed trustees
so

02:14:31.669 --> 02:14:31.679 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:14:35.109 --> 02:14:35.119 align:start position:0%
my position would be yes
 
02:14:37.030 --> 02:14:37.040 align:start position:0%
because they do receive direct funding
 
02:14:38.390 --> 02:14:38.400 align:start position:0%
from the state of new hampshire at
 
02:14:40.950 --> 02:14:40.960 align:start position:0%
pinkerton and the same for
 
02:14:43.189 --> 02:14:43.199 align:start position:0%
uh st johnsbury academy from the state
 
02:14:44.870 --> 02:14:44.880 align:start position:0%
of vermont
 
02:14:47.589 --> 02:14:47.599 align:start position:0%
so they most likely be inclusive within
 
02:14:49.750 --> 02:14:49.760 align:start position:0%
this as a public public private
 
02:14:51.589 --> 02:14:51.599 align:start position:0%
independent school okay thank you for
 
02:14:53.430 --> 02:14:53.440 align:start position:0%
clarifying that mr chairman apologies
 
02:14:55.030 --> 02:14:55.040 align:start position:0%
further question
 
02:14:57.030 --> 02:14:57.040 align:start position:0%
okay thank you um
 
02:14:59.109 --> 02:14:59.119 align:start position:0%
yes representative woodcock
 
02:15:01.510 --> 02:15:01.520 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman president
 
02:15:03.270 --> 02:15:03.280 align:start position:0%
two questions very simple
 
02:15:03.280 --> 02:15:04.310 align:start position:0%
two questions very simple
um

02:15:04.310 --> 02:15:04.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:15:06.149 --> 02:15:06.159 align:start position:0%
i'm assuming this this legislation is
 
02:15:08.629 --> 02:15:08.639 align:start position:0%
because this is not happening now do you
 
02:15:09.750 --> 02:15:09.760 align:start position:0%
know how many school assistants in new
 
02:15:12.870 --> 02:15:12.880 align:start position:0%
hampshire do not offer breakfast
 
02:15:13.910 --> 02:15:13.920 align:start position:0%
i should have brought that figure in
 
02:15:15.669 --> 02:15:15.679 align:start position:0%
front of me today it was uh it was um
 
02:15:17.030 --> 02:15:17.040 align:start position:0%
over the summer when i worked with the
 
02:15:18.470 --> 02:15:18.480 align:start position:0%
department of education and talked to
 
02:15:19.910 --> 02:15:19.920 align:start position:0%
them when i was first introducing this
 
02:15:21.830 --> 02:15:21.840 align:start position:0%
bill in the fall we did discuss that
 
02:15:24.629 --> 02:15:24.639 align:start position:0%
number um i can get that answer for you
 
02:15:26.629 --> 02:15:26.639 align:start position:0%
and i can um i can provide it to you by
 
02:15:28.229 --> 02:15:28.239 align:start position:0%
email after the hearing i apologize for
 
02:15:29.270 --> 02:15:29.280 align:start position:0%
not having it
 
02:15:31.510 --> 02:15:31.520 align:start position:0%
just to push that a little farther the
 
02:15:34.149 --> 02:15:34.159 align:start position:0%
fiscal note does say there are 30
 
02:15:36.069 --> 02:15:36.079 align:start position:0%
public schools currently not offering a
 
02:15:38.310 --> 02:15:38.320 align:start position:0%
breakfast program okay thank you mr
 
02:15:40.790 --> 02:15:40.800 align:start position:0%
chairman one more for me yes thank you
 
02:15:43.030 --> 02:15:43.040 align:start position:0%
uh does this does this uh bill or will
 
02:15:45.430 --> 02:15:45.440 align:start position:0%
this bill apply to shadow schools
 
02:15:47.669 --> 02:15:47.679 align:start position:0%
public charter schools um
 
02:15:49.030 --> 02:15:49.040 align:start position:0%
under the amendment if the amendment
 
02:15:50.310 --> 02:15:50.320 align:start position:0%
were adopted that i drafted for the
 
02:15:52.229 --> 02:15:52.239 align:start position:0%
committee yes because the public charter
 
02:15:55.910 --> 02:15:55.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:58.470 --> 02:15:58.480 align:start position:0%
yeah counter schools to be
 
02:16:01.030 --> 02:16:01.040 align:start position:0%
uh regulated by amendments like this
 
02:16:02.870 --> 02:16:02.880 align:start position:0%
representative have to be identified as
 
02:16:05.189 --> 02:16:05.199 align:start position:0%
charter schools yep and and so in even
 
02:16:06.629 --> 02:16:06.639 align:start position:0%
though they're public schools yeah in
 
02:16:08.149 --> 02:16:08.159 align:start position:0%
the amendment it's explicit each school
 
02:16:11.189 --> 02:16:11.199 align:start position:0%
board and chartered public school so i i
 
02:16:12.550 --> 02:16:12.560 align:start position:0%
make it explicit part of conversion
 
02:16:13.750 --> 02:16:13.760 align:start position:0%
school to what we have in the other
 
02:16:15.910 --> 02:16:15.920 align:start position:0%
charter schools are public schools in
 
02:16:16.870 --> 02:16:16.880 align:start position:0%
the state of new hampshire
 
02:16:18.950 --> 02:16:18.960 align:start position:0%
representative mullen you have thank you
 
02:16:21.430 --> 02:16:21.440 align:start position:0%
i do thank you mr chair and thank you
 
02:16:24.310 --> 02:16:24.320 align:start position:0%
representative for bringing this to us
 
02:16:26.790 --> 02:16:26.800 align:start position:0%
my question was originally in that
 
02:16:29.830 --> 02:16:29.840 align:start position:0%
fiscal note it says 30 new hampshire
 
02:16:32.469 --> 02:16:32.479 align:start position:0%
public schools currently not offering a
 
02:16:34.309 --> 02:16:34.319 align:start position:0%
breakfast program
 
02:16:37.110 --> 02:16:37.120 align:start position:0%
and i would want uh clarity on whether
 
02:16:40.230 --> 02:16:40.240 align:start position:0%
or not that's actual public schools or
 
02:16:42.950 --> 02:16:42.960 align:start position:0%
public school districts because
 
02:16:45.190 --> 02:16:45.200 align:start position:0%
i i think it could make a
 
02:16:47.190 --> 02:16:47.200 align:start position:0%
pretty big difference in the number of
 
02:16:47.200 --> 02:16:48.469 align:start position:0%
pretty big difference in the number of
schools

02:16:48.469 --> 02:16:48.479 align:start position:0%
schools
 
02:16:51.190 --> 02:16:51.200 align:start position:0%
and the answer to the question is there
 
02:16:53.429 --> 02:16:53.439 align:start position:0%
are some public schools that do not
 
02:16:53.439 --> 02:16:54.549 align:start position:0%
are some public schools that do not
offer

02:16:54.549 --> 02:16:54.559 align:start position:0%
offer
 
02:16:56.870 --> 02:16:56.880 align:start position:0%
at least prior to covid public schools
 
02:16:59.589 --> 02:16:59.599 align:start position:0%
that did not offer a meals program they
 
02:17:01.429 --> 02:17:01.439 align:start position:0%
didn't participate and there were
 
02:17:04.709 --> 02:17:04.719 align:start position:0%
private schools that did participate so
 
02:17:07.110 --> 02:17:07.120 align:start position:0%
you might want to uh double check on
 
02:17:08.469 --> 02:17:08.479 align:start position:0%
that too
 
02:17:10.150 --> 02:17:10.160 align:start position:0%
when you're talking to them
 
02:17:11.750 --> 02:17:11.760 align:start position:0%
thank you uh thank you for your question
 
02:17:13.190 --> 02:17:13.200 align:start position:0%
and i'll certainly do that and i'll try
 
02:17:14.389 --> 02:17:14.399 align:start position:0%
to follow up with you and represent
 
02:17:14.399 --> 02:17:15.349 align:start position:0%
to follow up with you and represent
woodcock

02:17:15.349 --> 02:17:15.359 align:start position:0%
woodcock
 
02:17:17.830 --> 02:17:17.840 align:start position:0%
is department of education hiding back
 
02:17:21.030 --> 02:17:21.040 align:start position:0%
there is that mckenzie back there
 
02:17:22.629 --> 02:17:22.639 align:start position:0%
do you have an answer to that so we
 
02:17:24.230 --> 02:17:24.240 align:start position:0%
might get it right
 
02:17:27.030 --> 02:17:27.040 align:start position:0%
whether the 30s or 30 are
 
02:17:28.790 --> 02:17:28.800 align:start position:0%
school districts or
 
02:17:30.790 --> 02:17:30.800 align:start position:0%
public schools
 
02:17:32.870 --> 02:17:32.880 align:start position:0%
which would be a huge difference in
 
02:17:36.469 --> 02:17:36.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:36.479 --> 02:17:37.750 align:start position:0%
 
well

02:17:37.750 --> 02:17:37.760 align:start position:0%
well
 
02:17:39.349 --> 02:17:39.359 align:start position:0%
you can say yes
 
02:17:39.359 --> 02:17:44.230 align:start position:0%
you can say yes
they're

02:17:44.230 --> 02:17:44.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:47.190 --> 02:17:47.200 align:start position:0%
watch come on up so that we we can um
 
02:17:53.669 --> 02:17:53.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:55.270 --> 02:17:55.280 align:start position:0%
you don't have to represent the shay
 
02:17:58.309 --> 02:17:58.319 align:start position:0%
we're not you know you're you're so
 
02:17:58.319 --> 02:18:02.150 align:start position:0%
we're not you know you're you're so
ok

02:18:02.150 --> 02:18:02.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:04.870 --> 02:18:04.880 align:start position:0%
thank you appreciate it um so 30 refers
 
02:18:07.750 --> 02:18:07.760 align:start position:0%
to public schools that are participating
 
02:18:10.070 --> 02:18:10.080 align:start position:0%
in the national school lunch program but
 
02:18:12.469 --> 02:18:12.479 align:start position:0%
are not providing school breakfasts so
 
02:18:15.030 --> 02:18:15.040 align:start position:0%
that does not include the public schools
 
02:18:19.429 --> 02:18:19.439 align:start position:0%
that are not participating in in nslp
 
02:18:22.629 --> 02:18:22.639 align:start position:0%
so just clarification is public schools
 
02:18:25.429 --> 02:18:25.439 align:start position:0%
not school districts that is correct but
 
02:18:27.349 --> 02:18:27.359 align:start position:0%
that is 30
 
02:18:29.349 --> 02:18:29.359 align:start position:0%
public schools that are participating in
 
02:18:31.589 --> 02:18:31.599 align:start position:0%
the federal program that are not
 
02:18:33.669 --> 02:18:33.679 align:start position:0%
providing breakfast that is not the
 
02:18:35.589 --> 02:18:35.599 align:start position:0%
universe of public schools to which this
 
02:18:37.830 --> 02:18:37.840 align:start position:0%
would apply and we're trying to clarify
 
02:18:40.309 --> 02:18:40.319 align:start position:0%
that data now thank you
 
02:18:41.910 --> 02:18:41.920 align:start position:0%
does that answer where you came from
 
02:18:43.270 --> 02:18:43.280 align:start position:0%
representative mullen
 
02:18:45.669 --> 02:18:45.679 align:start position:0%
it it does i would just ask uh before
 
02:18:48.950 --> 02:18:48.960 align:start position:0%
you leave mckenzie the um the second
 
02:18:51.270 --> 02:18:51.280 align:start position:0%
part of my comment was that we have
 
02:18:53.750 --> 02:18:53.760 align:start position:0%
private schools that actually
 
02:18:56.629 --> 02:18:56.639 align:start position:0%
participate in the federal foods program
 
02:18:58.950 --> 02:18:58.960 align:start position:0%
at least that was true prior to covet is
 
02:19:01.429 --> 02:19:01.439 align:start position:0%
it still true
 
02:19:04.230 --> 02:19:04.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:05.270 --> 02:19:05.280 align:start position:0%
are there any more questions for
 
02:19:09.110 --> 02:19:09.120 align:start position:0%
reference desche uh yes represent hobson
 
02:19:10.870 --> 02:19:10.880 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question uh i
 
02:19:13.429 --> 02:19:13.439 align:start position:0%
just wanted clarification in the bill
 
02:19:15.110 --> 02:19:15.120 align:start position:0%
uh whoops
 
02:19:15.120 --> 02:19:15.990 align:start position:0%
uh whoops
on

02:19:15.990 --> 02:19:16.000 align:start position:0%
on
 
02:19:18.950 --> 02:19:18.960 align:start position:0%
uh line three you mentioned such meals
 
02:19:21.990 --> 02:19:22.000 align:start position:0%
shall be served with cost or at a
 
02:19:27.270 --> 02:19:27.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:30.870 --> 02:19:30.880 align:start position:0%
can you can you explain how that would
 
02:19:38.150 --> 02:19:38.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:40.629 --> 02:19:40.639 align:start position:0%
i can give you my interpretation
 
02:19:42.230 --> 02:19:42.240 align:start position:0%
and kind of part of what i kind of
 
02:19:44.070 --> 02:19:44.080 align:start position:0%
intended and um that's a very good
 
02:19:44.080 --> 02:19:46.150 align:start position:0%
intended and um that's a very good
question

02:19:46.150 --> 02:19:46.160 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:19:48.070 --> 02:19:48.080 align:start position:0%
reduce cost i guess that could mean
 
02:19:51.750 --> 02:19:51.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:53.510 --> 02:19:53.520 align:start position:0%
from a small amount that the uh that the
 
02:19:55.510 --> 02:19:55.520 align:start position:0%
child has to pay to you know or the
 
02:19:57.510 --> 02:19:57.520 align:start position:0%
family to a larger amount but i i would
 
02:19:59.510 --> 02:19:59.520 align:start position:0%
assume then that that would um imply
 
02:19:59.520 --> 02:20:00.230 align:start position:0%
assume then that that would um imply
that

02:20:00.230 --> 02:20:00.240 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:20:03.190 --> 02:20:03.200 align:start position:0%
a um
 
02:20:05.510 --> 02:20:05.520 align:start position:0%
a certain amount of cost has to be borne
 
02:20:08.070 --> 02:20:08.080 align:start position:0%
by the um by the uh
 
02:20:13.190 --> 02:20:13.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:15.110 --> 02:20:15.120 align:start position:0%

graduation rates and improve short-term
 
02:21:57.910 --> 02:21:57.920 align:start position:0%
and long-term economic outcomes
 
02:21:59.190 --> 02:21:59.200 align:start position:0%

in the long term higher graduation rates
 
02:22:13.670 --> 02:22:13.680 align:start position:0%
lead to higher rates of

that this bill would

thank you very much
 
02:24:54.469 --> 02:24:54.479 align:start position:0%
i i see we have department of education
 
02:24:56.550 --> 02:24:56.560 align:start position:0%
back there still
 
02:24:58.710 --> 02:24:58.720 align:start position:0%
i i asked the question whether it be
 
02:25:01.190 --> 02:25:01.200 align:start position:0%
from mackenzie snow or caitlyn davis i
 
02:25:03.750 --> 02:25:03.760 align:start position:0%
see you here caitlyn
 
02:25:06.230 --> 02:25:06.240 align:start position:0%
the question is of the
 
02:25:07.990 --> 02:25:08.000 align:start position:0%
amount of money provided to these
 
02:25:09.990 --> 02:25:10.000 align:start position:0%
schools for the breakfast program is
 
02:25:12.469 --> 02:25:12.479 align:start position:0%
there any money that the local district
 
02:25:14.950 --> 02:25:14.960 align:start position:0%
has to raise locally in order to pay for
 
02:25:27.830 --> 02:25:27.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:29.110 --> 02:25:29.120 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question mackenzie
 
02:25:30.389 --> 02:25:30.399 align:start position:0%
snow division director of learner
 
02:25:31.910 --> 02:25:31.920 align:start position:0%
support again for the record and kelly
 
02:25:35.590 --> 02:25:35.600 align:start position:0%
rambo director of onps for the record um
 
02:25:37.910 --> 02:25:37.920 align:start position:0%
so right now the average meal price for
 
02:25:39.349 --> 02:25:39.359 align:start position:0%
school breakfast
 
02:25:43.349 --> 02:25:43.359 align:start position:0%
is two dollars and 35 cents um that
 
02:25:43.359 --> 02:25:44.630 align:start position:0%
is two dollars and 35 cents um that
includes

02:25:44.630 --> 02:25:44.640 align:start position:0%
includes
 
02:25:47.030 --> 02:25:47.040 align:start position:0%
an additional piece of aid the national
 
02:25:48.349 --> 02:25:48.359 align:start position:0%
average is
 
02:25:51.110 --> 02:25:51.120 align:start position:0%
2.72 cents so we would estimate that it
 
02:25:55.270 --> 02:25:55.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:58.550 --> 02:25:58.560 align:start position:0%
so as a follow-up to pay for the program
 
02:26:01.110 --> 02:26:01.120 align:start position:0%
is the money that comes from the federal
 
02:26:01.120 --> 02:26:02.070 align:start position:0%
is the money that comes from the federal
government

02:26:02.070 --> 02:26:02.080 align:start position:0%
government
 
02:26:04.309 --> 02:26:04.319 align:start position:0%
by way of this grant
 
02:26:07.670 --> 02:26:07.680 align:start position:0%
take care of the costs the total cost to
 
02:26:10.070 --> 02:26:10.080 align:start position:0%
run the program or is there anything
 
02:26:10.080 --> 02:26:11.510 align:start position:0%
run the program or is there anything
that

02:26:11.510 --> 02:26:11.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:26:14.469 --> 02:26:14.479 align:start position:0%
if these 30 schools go that direction
 
02:26:16.389 --> 02:26:16.399 align:start position:0%
are they going to have to put additional
 
02:26:19.270 --> 02:26:19.280 align:start position:0%
dollars in their budget to make it work
 
02:26:21.830 --> 02:26:21.840 align:start position:0%
so we we only have a set
 
02:26:23.510 --> 02:26:23.520 align:start position:0%
reimbursement rate from the federal
 
02:26:25.510 --> 02:26:25.520 align:start position:0%
government and from the state so if
 
02:26:27.349 --> 02:26:27.359 align:start position:0%
there are additional expenses that would
 
02:26:29.670 --> 02:26:29.680 align:start position:0%
be incurred at the local level we would
 
02:26:32.950 --> 02:26:32.960 align:start position:0%
not track that information necessarily
 
02:26:34.389 --> 02:26:34.399 align:start position:0%
so that could vary between school
 
02:26:36.230 --> 02:26:36.240 align:start position:0%
districts and schools
 
02:26:36.240 --> 02:26:37.110 align:start position:0%
districts and schools
so

02:26:37.110 --> 02:26:37.120 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:26:39.030 --> 02:26:39.040 align:start position:0%
and one last follow-up forgive me
 
02:26:40.950 --> 02:26:40.960 align:start position:0%
committee so if we have x number of
 
02:26:42.950 --> 02:26:42.960 align:start position:0%
dollars in the pot for the program and
 
02:26:46.710 --> 02:26:46.720 align:start position:0%
we add 30 schools more into that pot
 
02:26:48.630 --> 02:26:48.640 align:start position:0%
are the receiving districts right now
 
02:26:51.270 --> 02:26:51.280 align:start position:0%
going to receive less
 
02:26:53.750 --> 02:26:53.760 align:start position:0%
no not necessarily that's based on a
 
02:26:56.150 --> 02:26:56.160 align:start position:0%
set federal reimbursement rate but this
 
02:26:57.910 --> 02:26:57.920 align:start position:0%
bill as we understand it does require
 
02:26:59.590 --> 02:26:59.600 align:start position:0%
either participation in the national
 
02:27:01.270 --> 02:27:01.280 align:start position:0%
school lunch program
 
02:27:03.990 --> 02:27:04.000 align:start position:0%
and the provision of breakfast and lunch
 
02:27:05.670 --> 02:27:05.680 align:start position:0%
but if you do if you choose not to
 
02:27:07.349 --> 02:27:07.359 align:start position:0%
participate in the national school lunch
 
02:27:09.750 --> 02:27:09.760 align:start position:0%
program there must be a
 
02:27:11.830 --> 02:27:11.840 align:start position:0%
locally supported
 
02:27:13.910 --> 02:27:13.920 align:start position:0%
provision of school breakfast so whether
 
02:27:15.750 --> 02:27:15.760 align:start position:0%
you participate or not the requirement
 
02:27:17.429 --> 02:27:17.439 align:start position:0%
persists okay
 
02:27:18.550 --> 02:27:18.560 align:start position:0%
are the further questions of the
 
02:27:21.830 --> 02:27:21.840 align:start position:0%
department yes representative mullen
 
02:27:23.670 --> 02:27:23.680 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
02:27:27.110 --> 02:27:27.120 align:start position:0%
taking my question uh mackenzie so uh
 
02:27:30.309 --> 02:27:30.319 align:start position:0%
there was a reference made to senate
 
02:27:34.630 --> 02:27:34.640 align:start position:0%
bill 82 in 2019 that the governor signed
 
02:27:37.510 --> 02:27:37.520 align:start position:0%
in which it was stated this morning
 
02:27:39.550 --> 02:27:39.560 align:start position:0%
that new hampshire assumed
 
02:27:41.990 --> 02:27:42.000 align:start position:0%
responsibility for the costs
 
02:27:46.389 --> 02:27:46.399 align:start position:0%
of a free breakfast to any student who
 
02:27:46.399 --> 02:27:48.469 align:start position:0%
of a free breakfast to any student who
qualifies

02:27:48.469 --> 02:27:48.479 align:start position:0%
qualifies
 
02:27:48.479 --> 02:27:49.830 align:start position:0%
qualifies
uh

02:27:49.830 --> 02:27:49.840 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:27:52.870 --> 02:27:52.880 align:start position:0%
do you have any sense of how much money
 
02:27:55.110 --> 02:27:55.120 align:start position:0%
is being spent by the
 
02:27:57.830 --> 02:27:57.840 align:start position:0%
state at this point or how many schools
 
02:28:00.950 --> 02:28:00.960 align:start position:0%
are actually taking advantage of that
 
02:28:03.750 --> 02:28:03.760 align:start position:0%
so again we have um
 
02:28:07.190 --> 02:28:07.200 align:start position:0%
of our 466 schools participating in slp
 
02:28:08.870 --> 02:28:08.880 align:start position:0%
all of those participate in breakfast
 
02:28:11.510 --> 02:28:11.520 align:start position:0%
with the exception of 30. so that is the
 
02:28:17.030 --> 02:28:17.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:18.950 --> 02:28:18.960 align:start position:0%
is that responsive to your question
 
02:28:18.960 --> 02:28:20.950 align:start position:0%
is that responsive to your question
okay

02:28:20.950 --> 02:28:20.960 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:28:23.590 --> 02:28:23.600 align:start position:0%
represent lake
 
02:28:25.830 --> 02:28:25.840 align:start position:0%
so if the school is currently not doing
 
02:28:28.870 --> 02:28:28.880 align:start position:0%
breakfast i.e they're not hiring people
 
02:28:31.270 --> 02:28:31.280 align:start position:0%
they don't have the cafeteria
 
02:28:34.630 --> 02:28:34.640 align:start position:0%
working at that point etc
 
02:28:37.429 --> 02:28:37.439 align:start position:0%
does what the federal government pay per
 
02:28:37.439 --> 02:28:38.389 align:start position:0%
does what the federal government pay per
meal

02:28:38.389 --> 02:28:38.399 align:start position:0%
meal
 
02:28:40.389 --> 02:28:40.399 align:start position:0%
cover would they cover all of that the
 
02:28:42.389 --> 02:28:42.399 align:start position:0%
extra help the extra people all of that
 
02:28:44.630 --> 02:28:44.640 align:start position:0%
kind of stuff is it sufficient
 
02:28:47.910 --> 02:28:47.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question so um
 
02:28:49.030 --> 02:28:49.040 align:start position:0%
in our
 
02:28:51.110 --> 02:28:51.120 align:start position:0%
recommendation that the amount would be
 
02:28:53.270 --> 02:28:53.280 align:start position:0%
indeterminable the cost of the local
 
02:28:55.510 --> 02:28:55.520 align:start position:0%
level would be indeterminable in that we
 
02:28:57.429 --> 02:28:57.439 align:start position:0%
include startup costs which it would
 
02:28:59.830 --> 02:28:59.840 align:start position:0%
include equipment labor onboarding
 
02:29:02.550 --> 02:29:02.560 align:start position:0%
training of staff outreach about the
 
02:29:04.950 --> 02:29:04.960 align:start position:0%
opportunity and from other states we
 
02:29:07.429 --> 02:29:07.439 align:start position:0%
know that estimates could be up to 23
 
02:29:09.510 --> 02:29:09.520 align:start position:0%
000 per school
 
02:29:11.429 --> 02:29:11.439 align:start position:0%
depending on what equipment what
 
02:29:13.110 --> 02:29:13.120 align:start position:0%
infrastructure the school and school
 
02:29:15.270 --> 02:29:15.280 align:start position:0%
district have currently
 
02:29:16.870 --> 02:29:16.880 align:start position:0%
and again those startup costs would not
 
02:29:20.469 --> 02:29:20.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:23.270 --> 02:29:23.280 align:start position:0%

the house finance committee uh do you
 
02:34:06.710 --> 02:34:06.720 align:start position:0%
have any concerns or reservations
 
02:34:08.790 --> 02:34:08.800 align:start position:0%
regarding a program that was budgeted at
 
02:34:12.150 --> 02:34:12.160 align:start position:0%
129 000 and so far has clocked in at
 
02:34:13.830 --> 02:34:13.840 align:start position:0%
over eight million dollars in terms of
 
02:34:17.429 --> 02:34:17.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:19.750 --> 02:34:19.760 align:start position:0%
i do not as a supporter of this there
 
02:34:22.950 --> 02:34:22.960 align:start position:0%
are ways within that that uh budget
 
02:34:25.270 --> 02:34:25.280 align:start position:0%
which is very large to move some monies
 
02:34:27.270 --> 02:34:27.280 align:start position:0%
around and that's what we do in finance
 
02:34:31.429 --> 02:34:31.439 align:start position:0%
committee but we try to meet the demand
 
02:34:33.270 --> 02:34:33.280 align:start position:0%
follow follow up
 
02:34:35.670 --> 02:34:35.680 align:start position:0%
thank you very much um would you be
 
02:34:38.309 --> 02:34:38.319 align:start position:0%
moving that money around from within the
 
02:34:41.110 --> 02:34:41.120 align:start position:0%
education uh trust fund
 
02:34:42.830 --> 02:34:42.840 align:start position:0%
as much as possible
 
02:34:45.590 --> 02:34:45.600 align:start position:0%
yes because every year there seems to be
 
02:34:47.910 --> 02:34:47.920 align:start position:0%
reduction in student count so
 
02:34:50.550 --> 02:34:50.560 align:start position:0%
that usually is excess money
 
02:34:52.710 --> 02:34:52.720 align:start position:0%
follow up on that yes
 
02:34:54.790 --> 02:34:54.800 align:start position:0%
um thank you very much for uh for taking
 
02:34:57.190 --> 02:34:57.200 align:start position:0%
my question um the in terms of the
 
02:35:00.070 --> 02:35:00.080 align:start position:0%
reduction on student counts i believe
 
02:35:01.990 --> 02:35:02.000 align:start position:0%
the education trust fund
 
02:35:05.510 --> 02:35:05.520 align:start position:0%
is based on um on actual
 
02:35:09.910 --> 02:35:09.920 align:start position:0%
uh student numbers or student um
 
02:35:12.630 --> 02:35:12.640 align:start position:0%
adm numbers provided by the department
 
02:35:15.270 --> 02:35:15.280 align:start position:0%
for the prior for the prior year is that
 
02:35:17.670 --> 02:35:17.680 align:start position:0%
not the case
 
02:35:17.680 --> 02:35:19.030 align:start position:0%
not the case
yes

02:35:19.030 --> 02:35:19.040 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:35:20.950 --> 02:35:20.960 align:start position:0%
thank you however within the current
 
02:35:22.309 --> 02:35:22.319 align:start position:0%
year there are still
 
02:35:22.319 --> 02:35:26.389 align:start position:0%
year there are still
differences

02:35:26.389 --> 02:35:26.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:30.070 --> 02:35:30.080 align:start position:0%
okay uh represent tanner
 
02:35:32.230 --> 02:35:32.240 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman for for recognizing
 
02:35:33.910 --> 02:35:33.920 align:start position:0%

02:35:35.750 --> 02:35:35.760 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
 
02:35:35.760 --> 02:35:36.630 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
um

02:35:36.630 --> 02:35:36.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:35:39.349 --> 02:35:39.359 align:start position:0%
the scholarship organization gets a
 
02:35:41.110 --> 02:35:41.120 align:start position:0%
sizeable amount of money
 
02:35:44.389 --> 02:35:44.399 align:start position:0%
uh to administer this program the efas
 
02:35:46.150 --> 02:35:46.160 align:start position:0%
and since it's grown to eight million
 
02:35:49.510 --> 02:35:49.520 align:start position:0%
dollars and probably going up even more
 
02:35:50.870 --> 02:35:50.880 align:start position:0%
i'm wondering if
 
02:35:52.309 --> 02:35:52.319 align:start position:0%
some of that money
 
02:35:54.309 --> 02:35:54.319 align:start position:0%
could be used to offset this position at
 
02:35:56.870 --> 02:35:56.880 align:start position:0%
the department of education
 
02:35:58.630 --> 02:35:58.640 align:start position:0%
uh that's that's
 
02:36:00.070 --> 02:36:00.080 align:start position:0%
that's certainly something that we'll be
 
02:36:02.469 --> 02:36:02.479 align:start position:0%
able to address when we get the bill
 
02:36:03.670 --> 02:36:03.680 align:start position:0%
over to us
 
02:36:05.270 --> 02:36:05.280 align:start position:0%
at this point we haven't really got into
 
02:36:06.630 --> 02:36:06.640 align:start position:0%
that fine
 
02:36:11.190 --> 02:36:11.200 align:start position:0%
print of that uh detail thank you

a lot of them like very disappointed
 
02:37:33.510 --> 02:37:33.520 align:start position:0%
that the income
 
02:37:34.870 --> 02:37:34.880 align:start position:0%
prohibits them
 
02:37:36.550 --> 02:37:36.560 align:start position:0%
from enrolling their kids into these
 
02:37:36.560 --> 02:37:38.070 align:start position:0%
from enrolling their kids into these

and they love this freedom account
 
02:37:43.510 --> 02:37:43.520 align:start position:0%
and even my own family
 
02:37:46.550 --> 02:37:46.560 align:start position:0%
i try to help my nephew enroll into this
 
02:37:46.560 --> 02:37:47.830 align:start position:0%
i try to help my nephew enroll into this
program

02:37:47.830 --> 02:37:47.840 align:start position:0%
program
 
02:37:50.550 --> 02:37:50.560 align:start position:0%
and i have many questions
 
02:37:53.270 --> 02:37:53.280 align:start position:0%
so it would be very helpful
 
02:37:54.389 --> 02:37:54.399 align:start position:0%
to have
 
02:37:54.399 --> 02:37:55.510 align:start position:0%
to have
people

02:37:55.510 --> 02:37:55.520 align:start position:0%
people
 
02:37:59.030 --> 02:37:59.040 align:start position:0%
and funding designated to help a lot of
 
02:37:59.040 --> 02:38:00.389 align:start position:0%
and funding designated to help a lot of
parents

02:38:00.389 --> 02:38:00.399 align:start position:0%
parents
 
02:38:02.550 --> 02:38:02.560 align:start position:0%
and and guidance
 
02:38:05.510 --> 02:38:05.520 align:start position:0%
to enroll the kids into the programs of
 
02:38:07.590 --> 02:38:07.600 align:start position:0%
the parents choice
 
02:38:09.429 --> 02:38:09.439 align:start position:0%
the parents leaving the public school
 
02:38:11.110 --> 02:38:11.120 align:start position:0%
for many reasons
 
02:38:12.710 --> 02:38:12.720 align:start position:0%
and one of the main reasons is the
 
02:38:15.030 --> 02:38:15.040 align:start position:0%
critical race theory and the other thing
 
02:38:17.349 --> 02:38:17.359 align:start position:0%
is about those things that
 
02:38:19.510 --> 02:38:19.520 align:start position:0%
the public school
 
02:38:22.150 --> 02:38:22.160 align:start position:0%
some of them teaching like this sexual
 
02:38:22.160 --> 02:38:23.190 align:start position:0%
some of them teaching like this sexual
stuff

02:38:23.190 --> 02:38:23.200 align:start position:0%
stuff
 
02:38:25.349 --> 02:38:25.359 align:start position:0%
that even adult don't even they're
 
02:38:26.870 --> 02:38:26.880 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
02:38:29.349 --> 02:38:29.359 align:start position:0%
so it's corrupt the child's mind and the
 
02:38:32.309 --> 02:38:32.319 align:start position:0%
child's innocence at such early age at
 
02:38:34.230 --> 02:38:34.240 align:start position:0%
any age actually
 
02:38:38.550 --> 02:38:38.560 align:start position:0%
so i'm here to ask for your support
 
02:38:40.790 --> 02:38:40.800 align:start position:0%
to support this bill
 
02:38:42.389 --> 02:38:42.399 align:start position:0%
and if possible
 
02:38:44.870 --> 02:38:44.880 align:start position:0%
get rid of this income limit
 
02:38:47.030 --> 02:38:47.040 align:start position:0%
or maybe raise it up to 500 000 or
 
02:38:50.230 --> 02:38:50.240 align:start position:0%
something like that because 150 000 with
 
02:38:52.630 --> 02:38:52.640 align:start position:0%
the income and inflation right now it
 
02:38:54.389 --> 02:38:54.399 align:start position:0%
means nothing
 
02:38:56.790 --> 02:38:56.800 align:start position:0%
and parents live in the limbo
 
02:38:58.870 --> 02:38:58.880 align:start position:0%
to like get the children stuck in the
 
02:39:00.230 --> 02:39:00.240 align:start position:0%
public school
 
02:39:01.910 --> 02:39:01.920 align:start position:0%
when they go to the school board
 
02:39:04.230 --> 02:39:04.240 align:start position:0%
meetings the school board
 
02:39:05.830 --> 02:39:05.840 align:start position:0%
treat them like
 
02:39:08.150 --> 02:39:08.160 align:start position:0%
enemies they don't even listen to their
 
02:39:10.309 --> 02:39:10.319 align:start position:0%
parents they make decisions for the
 
02:39:12.550 --> 02:39:12.560 align:start position:0%
parents to teach what's in the school
 
02:39:13.910 --> 02:39:13.920 align:start position:0%
which is wrong
 
02:39:16.070 --> 02:39:16.080 align:start position:0%
parents should have the primary choice
 
02:39:18.070 --> 02:39:18.080 align:start position:0%
in what their child should learn and
 
02:39:19.830 --> 02:39:19.840 align:start position:0%
should not learn
 
02:39:22.469 --> 02:39:22.479 align:start position:0%
so that's why this freedom account is a
 
02:39:24.950 --> 02:39:24.960 align:start position:0%
freedom for the parents to choose
 
02:39:26.550 --> 02:39:26.560 align:start position:0%
but why is that we have such a
 
02:39:29.110 --> 02:39:29.120 align:start position:0%
discrimination based on the income
 
02:39:31.110 --> 02:39:31.120 align:start position:0%
on the parents
 
02:39:33.429 --> 02:39:33.439 align:start position:0%
all men are created equal
 
02:39:36.630 --> 02:39:36.640 align:start position:0%
not rich men and women are different no
 
02:39:38.469 --> 02:39:38.479 align:start position:0%
we should have that choice
 
02:39:41.990 --> 02:39:42.000 align:start position:0%
and i'm speaking on behalf of a lot of
 
02:39:44.150 --> 02:39:44.160 align:start position:0%
new hampshire citizens i went to a lot
 
02:39:46.550 --> 02:39:46.560 align:start position:0%
of fair and set up tables with my
 
02:39:48.389 --> 02:39:48.399 align:start position:0%
friends and team
 
02:39:50.630 --> 02:39:50.640 align:start position:0%
to help people to tell people about
 
02:39:53.270 --> 02:39:53.280 align:start position:0%
these programs to give them choices
 
02:39:56.150 --> 02:39:56.160 align:start position:0%
and help them sign them up i got emails
 
02:39:57.990 --> 02:39:58.000 align:start position:0%
to prove it to you

yay hello thank you for answering my
questions

02:41:06.790 --> 02:41:06.800 align:start position:0%
questions
 
02:41:06.800 --> 02:41:07.750 align:start position:0%
questions
um

02:41:07.750 --> 02:41:07.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:41:09.590 --> 02:41:09.600 align:start position:0%
my understanding i
 
02:41:12.469 --> 02:41:12.479 align:start position:0%
with this bill i ended up talking with
 
02:41:15.670 --> 02:41:15.680 align:start position:0%
the scholarship organization
 
02:41:15.680 --> 02:41:16.710 align:start position:0%
the scholarship organization
and

02:41:16.710 --> 02:41:16.720 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:41:19.030 --> 02:41:19.040 align:start position:0%
it seems that at least for all of the
 
02:41:21.670 --> 02:41:21.680 align:start position:0%
setup which was the large hard work of
 
02:41:23.670 --> 02:41:23.680 align:start position:0%
figuring out how all this works and
 
02:41:26.230 --> 02:41:26.240 align:start position:0%
everything that ended up laying on the
 
02:41:28.710 --> 02:41:28.720 align:start position:0%
scholarship organization which makes
 
02:41:30.309 --> 02:41:30.319 align:start position:0%
sense they're the ones that get 10
 
02:41:30.319 --> 02:41:31.670 align:start position:0%
sense they're the ones that get 10
percent

02:41:31.670 --> 02:41:31.680 align:start position:0%
percent
 
02:41:33.830 --> 02:41:33.840 align:start position:0%
i'm just wondering now
 
02:41:33.840 --> 02:41:34.790 align:start position:0%
i'm just wondering now
that

02:41:34.790 --> 02:41:34.800 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:41:34.800 --> 02:41:35.290 align:start position:0%
that
um

02:41:35.290 --> 02:41:35.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:41:35.300 --> 02:41:36.950 align:start position:0%
um
[Music]

02:41:36.950 --> 02:41:36.960 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:41:41.110 --> 02:41:41.120 align:start position:0%
they're using i guess i4c to put in
 
02:41:43.510 --> 02:41:43.520 align:start position:0%
pupils and double checking and checking
 
02:41:45.990 --> 02:41:46.000 align:start position:0%
with schools and making sure that
 
02:41:47.750 --> 02:41:47.760 align:start position:0%
nothing is
 
02:41:49.590 --> 02:41:49.600 align:start position:0%
you know the kids aren't multiply
 
02:41:49.600 --> 02:41:50.870 align:start position:0%
you know the kids aren't multiply
enrolled

02:41:50.870 --> 02:41:50.880 align:start position:0%
enrolled
 
02:41:52.710 --> 02:41:52.720 align:start position:0%
and and all of that kind of stuff and
 
02:41:55.190 --> 02:41:55.200 align:start position:0%
most of the work of setup is done
 
02:41:56.790 --> 02:41:56.800 align:start position:0%
it seems like
 
02:41:56.800 --> 02:41:57.750 align:start position:0%
it seems like
um

02:41:57.750 --> 02:41:57.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:41:59.830 --> 02:41:59.840 align:start position:0%
now we're shutting the door after the
 
02:42:02.550 --> 02:42:02.560 align:start position:0%
horse is gone i'm wondering why we need
 
02:42:04.469 --> 02:42:04.479 align:start position:0%
this position now it seems like it would
 
02:42:06.550 --> 02:42:06.560 align:start position:0%
have been really good at the
 
02:42:08.230 --> 02:42:08.240 align:start position:0%
in the last year
 
02:42:09.830 --> 02:42:09.840 align:start position:0%
so first of all thank you for the
 
02:42:11.349 --> 02:42:11.359 align:start position:0%
question i completely agree it had been
 
02:42:12.790 --> 02:42:12.800 align:start position:0%
very helpful to have an administrator at
 
02:42:14.550 --> 02:42:14.560 align:start position:0%
the beginning of this program
 
02:42:16.309 --> 02:42:16.319 align:start position:0%
the original fiscal note for the bill
 
02:42:18.150 --> 02:42:18.160 align:start position:0%
did have a administrator and
 
02:42:20.070 --> 02:42:20.080 align:start position:0%
unfortunately the legislature chose not
 
02:42:21.190 --> 02:42:21.200 align:start position:0%
to give us that position at the
 
02:42:22.950 --> 02:42:22.960 align:start position:0%
department of education
 
02:42:22.960 --> 02:42:24.710 align:start position:0%
department of education
um

02:42:24.710 --> 02:42:24.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:42:27.190 --> 02:42:27.200 align:start position:0%
i the uh the initial work the initial
 
02:42:28.710 --> 02:42:28.720 align:start position:0%
set up the program
 
02:42:30.710 --> 02:42:30.720 align:start position:0%
was very cumbersome from the department
 
02:42:32.870 --> 02:42:32.880 align:start position:0%
um as are all of the new programs that
 
02:42:34.389 --> 02:42:34.399 align:start position:0%
are continuously created by the
 
02:42:35.910 --> 02:42:35.920 align:start position:0%
legislature for the department without
 
02:42:37.830 --> 02:42:37.840 align:start position:0%
existing or without additional staff so
 
02:42:39.990 --> 02:42:40.000 align:start position:0%
i would like everybody to remember that
 
02:42:41.349 --> 02:42:41.359 align:start position:0%
as you're working through the session
 
02:42:44.630 --> 02:42:44.640 align:start position:0%
the amount of work the department does
 
02:42:46.230 --> 02:42:46.240 align:start position:0%
but there is a lot of ongoing work
 
02:42:46.240 --> 02:42:47.110 align:start position:0%
but there is a lot of ongoing work
that's

02:42:47.110 --> 02:42:47.120 align:start position:0%
that's
 
02:42:48.630 --> 02:42:48.640 align:start position:0%
included so
 
02:42:50.150 --> 02:42:50.160 align:start position:0%
while the scholarship organization is
 
02:42:52.150 --> 02:42:52.160 align:start position:0%
working directly with the parents no
 
02:42:53.429 --> 02:42:53.439 align:start position:0%
different than a public school or
 
02:42:55.030 --> 02:42:55.040 align:start position:0%
non-public school working directly with
 
02:42:56.710 --> 02:42:56.720 align:start position:0%
parents that are enrolled
 
02:42:58.469 --> 02:42:58.479 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of reporting and oversight
 
02:42:59.910 --> 02:42:59.920 align:start position:0%
that needs to be done by the department
 
02:43:02.150 --> 02:43:02.160 align:start position:0%
of education that is ongoing
 
02:43:04.309 --> 02:43:04.319 align:start position:0%
work for the department to take on
 
02:43:05.590 --> 02:43:05.600 align:start position:0%
each year
 
02:43:06.710 --> 02:43:06.720 align:start position:0%
there are several
 
02:43:08.630 --> 02:43:08.640 align:start position:0%
large data reports that are done by the
 
02:43:10.469 --> 02:43:10.479 align:start position:0%
scholarship organization
 
02:43:12.230 --> 02:43:12.240 align:start position:0%
the children's scholarship foundation
 
02:43:13.590 --> 02:43:13.600 align:start position:0%
has been
 
02:43:16.710 --> 02:43:16.720 align:start position:0%
a very good kind of test case and the
 
02:43:17.910 --> 02:43:17.920 align:start position:0%
number of times you know we had to go
 
02:43:19.269 --> 02:43:19.279 align:start position:0%
back and forth and we're working very
 
02:43:21.670 --> 02:43:21.680 align:start position:0%
regularly on sundays to try to work
 
02:43:22.790 --> 02:43:22.800 align:start position:0%
through data
 
02:43:25.910 --> 02:43:25.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:27.190 --> 02:43:27.200 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of those that i don't
 
02:43:28.630 --> 02:43:28.640 align:start position:0%
want to repeat and hopefully having a
 
02:43:30.710 --> 02:43:30.720 align:start position:0%
full-time administrator will
 
02:43:33.429 --> 02:43:33.439 align:start position:0%
provide some support for the department
 
02:43:35.030 --> 02:43:35.040 align:start position:0%
every single time the
 
02:43:37.110 --> 02:43:37.120 align:start position:0%
scholarship organization enters data to
 
02:43:38.950 --> 02:43:38.960 align:start position:0%
our system because of the
 
02:43:40.550 --> 02:43:40.560 align:start position:0%
partially because of the type of systems
 
02:43:42.070 --> 02:43:42.080 align:start position:0%
that we have or we don't have real-time
 
02:43:43.910 --> 02:43:43.920 align:start position:0%
data collection systems
 
02:43:46.070 --> 02:43:46.080 align:start position:0%
we have to
 
02:43:48.710 --> 02:43:48.720 align:start position:0%
reconcile that all out by hand we have
 
02:43:50.070 --> 02:43:50.080 align:start position:0%
to work with the scholarship
 
02:43:52.150 --> 02:43:52.160 align:start position:0%
organization to say you've submitted the
 
02:43:54.070 --> 02:43:54.080 align:start position:0%
student but the student is submitted by
 
02:43:56.150 --> 02:43:56.160 align:start position:0%
the school you have conversations with
 
02:43:57.349 --> 02:43:57.359 align:start position:0%
the school and the scholarship
 
02:43:59.750 --> 02:43:59.760 align:start position:0%
organization in no different manner than
 
02:44:01.830 --> 02:44:01.840 align:start position:0%
we do when two public schools submit the
 
02:44:03.830 --> 02:44:03.840 align:start position:0%
same student so it's just additional
 
02:44:06.070 --> 02:44:06.080 align:start position:0%
work that's been created with these with
 
02:44:08.389 --> 02:44:08.399 align:start position:0%
the efa program
 
02:44:10.550 --> 02:44:10.560 align:start position:0%
other things that come hand in hand are
 
02:44:12.150 --> 02:44:12.160 align:start position:0%
the legislative oversight committee and
 
02:44:14.389 --> 02:44:14.399 align:start position:0%
data requests by the legislature by
 
02:44:16.630 --> 02:44:16.640 align:start position:0%
members of the public
 
02:44:19.590 --> 02:44:19.600 align:start position:0%
the rfps and the contract negotiations
 
02:44:22.309 --> 02:44:22.319 align:start position:0%
that come with um doing a scholarship
 
02:44:22.319 --> 02:44:23.510 align:start position:0%
that come with um doing a scholarship
organization

02:44:23.510 --> 02:44:23.520 align:start position:0%
organization
 
02:44:25.670 --> 02:44:25.680 align:start position:0%
request for proposal and and then
 
02:44:28.309 --> 02:44:28.319 align:start position:0%
ongoing operations um
 
02:44:30.230 --> 02:44:30.240 align:start position:0%
additional reporting requirements that
 
02:44:31.990 --> 02:44:32.000 align:start position:0%
will likely come on the department so it
 
02:44:32.790 --> 02:44:32.800 align:start position:0%
is a
 
02:44:35.670 --> 02:44:35.680 align:start position:0%
an ongoing program that needs support
 
02:44:37.349 --> 02:44:37.359 align:start position:0%
within the department as well as the
 
02:44:38.469 --> 02:44:38.479 align:start position:0%
support that the scholarship
 
02:44:40.150 --> 02:44:40.160 align:start position:0%
organization is providing directly to
 
02:44:43.750 --> 02:44:43.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:45.590 --> 02:44:45.600 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very much are there
 
02:44:47.990 --> 02:44:48.000 align:start position:0%
further questions represent luna
 
02:44:50.150 --> 02:44:50.160 align:start position:0%
uh thank you very much mr chair and uh
 
02:44:51.670 --> 02:44:51.680 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for uh for being
 
02:44:53.910 --> 02:44:53.920 align:start position:0%
with us this morning um representative
 
02:44:56.550 --> 02:44:56.560 align:start position:0%
weiler referred to
 
02:44:58.950 --> 02:44:58.960 align:start position:0%
the program as yielding better results
 
02:45:00.950 --> 02:45:00.960 align:start position:0%
for our state i believe that's what his
 
02:45:04.230 --> 02:45:04.240 align:start position:0%
exact words were but as far as results
 
02:45:06.710 --> 02:45:06.720 align:start position:0%
go and i think this ties into um into
 
02:45:08.870 --> 02:45:08.880 align:start position:0%
your testimony ms davis
 
02:45:11.269 --> 02:45:11.279 align:start position:0%
um would would this administrator be
 
02:45:13.030 --> 02:45:13.040 align:start position:0%
able to
 
02:45:13.040 --> 02:45:14.790 align:start position:0%
able to
provide

02:45:14.790 --> 02:45:14.800 align:start position:0%
provide
 
02:45:16.950 --> 02:45:16.960 align:start position:0%
provide results obviously not
 
02:45:20.389 --> 02:45:20.399 align:start position:0%
not connected with specific students but
 
02:45:23.349 --> 02:45:23.359 align:start position:0%
but but results as far for this program
 
02:45:26.389 --> 02:45:26.399 align:start position:0%
as far as student performance
 
02:45:28.550 --> 02:45:28.560 align:start position:0%
local expenditures and statewide
 
02:45:33.670 --> 02:45:33.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:35.190 --> 02:45:35.200 align:start position:0%
so this position would take up those
 
02:45:37.269 --> 02:45:37.279 align:start position:0%
responsibilities related to the academic
 
02:45:39.670 --> 02:45:39.680 align:start position:0%
achievement of those efa participating
 
02:45:39.680 --> 02:45:46.070 align:start position:0%
achievement of those efa participating
students

02:45:46.070 --> 02:45:46.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:47.910 --> 02:45:47.920 align:start position:0%
so state expenditures yes local
 
02:45:49.590 --> 02:45:49.600 align:start position:0%
expenditures i'm unsure to what you're
 
02:45:52.710 --> 02:45:52.720 align:start position:0%
referring all right
 
02:45:57.349 --> 02:45:57.359 align:start position:0%
uh thanks let me be very clear at the um
 
02:45:59.670 --> 02:45:59.680 align:start position:0%
when when uh when this voucher program
 
02:46:04.630 --> 02:46:04.640 align:start position:0%
was being proposed the primary um
 
02:46:06.870 --> 02:46:06.880 align:start position:0%
one of the primary emphasis uh offered
 
02:46:08.550 --> 02:46:08.560 align:start position:0%
by the commissioner was that there was
 
02:46:10.950 --> 02:46:10.960 align:start position:0%
going to be substantial reduction in
 
02:46:10.960 --> 02:46:11.910 align:start position:0%
going to be substantial reduction in
local

02:46:11.910 --> 02:46:11.920 align:start position:0%
local
 
02:46:15.030 --> 02:46:15.040 align:start position:0%
public school expenditures so given that
 
02:46:17.670 --> 02:46:17.680 align:start position:0%
um you know was was a was a significant
 
02:46:20.070 --> 02:46:20.080 align:start position:0%
motivation behind the program i think it
 
02:46:21.910 --> 02:46:21.920 align:start position:0%
would be fair to
 
02:46:25.990 --> 02:46:26.000 align:start position:0%
ask the department to um to to track and
 
02:46:28.870 --> 02:46:28.880 align:start position:0%
present the results of those local
 
02:46:28.880 --> 02:46:30.550 align:start position:0%
present the results of those local
expenditures

02:46:30.550 --> 02:46:30.560 align:start position:0%
expenditures
 
02:46:32.150 --> 02:46:32.160 align:start position:0%
thank you for the clarification yes this
 
02:46:34.389 --> 02:46:34.399 align:start position:0%
would be included the impact on local
 
02:46:36.230 --> 02:46:36.240 align:start position:0%
school districts and enrollments would
 
02:46:38.150 --> 02:46:38.160 align:start position:0%
be included in the responsibilities of
 
02:46:39.990 --> 02:46:40.000 align:start position:0%
the administrator
 
02:46:41.990 --> 02:46:42.000 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
02:46:44.389 --> 02:46:44.399 align:start position:0%
representative ellison
 
02:46:46.309 --> 02:46:46.319 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thanks for being
 
02:46:48.230 --> 02:46:48.240 align:start position:0%
here thanks for taking my question uh
 
02:46:50.870 --> 02:46:50.880 align:start position:0%
clarification does the department have
 
02:46:53.670 --> 02:46:53.680 align:start position:0%
open positions for school coordinator or
 
02:46:56.630 --> 02:46:56.640 align:start position:0%
school counselors and school nurses to
 
02:46:59.349 --> 02:46:59.359 align:start position:0%
your to your
 
02:46:59.359 --> 02:47:00.550 align:start position:0%
your to your
college

02:47:00.550 --> 02:47:00.560 align:start position:0%
college
 
02:47:02.950 --> 02:47:02.960 align:start position:0%
so we do not employ school counselors we
 
02:47:04.870 --> 02:47:04.880 align:start position:0%
have a team within the division of
 
02:47:06.550 --> 02:47:06.560 align:start position:0%
learner support
 
02:47:08.230 --> 02:47:08.240 align:start position:0%
the office of social and emotional
 
02:47:09.910 --> 02:47:09.920 align:start position:0%
wellness which has
 
02:47:13.030 --> 02:47:13.040 align:start position:0%
mtssb consultants covering our five
 
02:47:13.040 --> 02:47:14.150 align:start position:0%
mtssb consultants covering our five
regions

02:47:14.150 --> 02:47:14.160 align:start position:0%
regions
 
02:47:17.670 --> 02:47:17.680 align:start position:0%
two of those positions are open
 
02:47:19.750 --> 02:47:19.760 align:start position:0%
and then related to school nurses that
 
02:47:21.349 --> 02:47:21.359 align:start position:0%
is a position that has been open for
 
02:47:24.790 --> 02:47:24.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:27.110 --> 02:47:27.120 align:start position:0%
follow-up yes
 
02:47:29.030 --> 02:47:29.040 align:start position:0%
do you have any sense about when these
 
02:47:30.469 --> 02:47:30.479 align:start position:0%
are going to be filled because i think
 
02:47:32.070 --> 02:47:32.080 align:start position:0%
the school nursing position has been
 
02:47:34.630 --> 02:47:34.640 align:start position:0%
open for quite a while we are we have a
 
02:47:36.309 --> 02:47:36.319 align:start position:0%
number of positions open across the
 
02:47:39.269 --> 02:47:39.279 align:start position:0%
agency we are no exception to the
 
02:47:41.990 --> 02:47:42.000 align:start position:0%
constraints on on hiring and the
 
02:47:44.550 --> 02:47:44.560 align:start position:0%
attractiveness of state employment um so
 
02:47:46.150 --> 02:47:46.160 align:start position:0%
we are actively recruiting for a number
 
02:47:48.790 --> 02:47:48.800 align:start position:0%
of positions across the agency
 
02:47:49.990 --> 02:47:50.000 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:47:50.000 --> 02:47:56.790 align:start position:0%
thank you
representative

02:47:56.790 --> 02:47:56.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:59.349 --> 02:47:59.359 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you ladies
 
02:48:01.510 --> 02:48:01.520 align:start position:0%
i believe what representative ellison
 
02:48:03.990 --> 02:48:04.000 align:start position:0%
was referring to was a position that was
 
02:48:06.550 --> 02:48:06.560 align:start position:0%
created in 2019
 
02:48:09.670 --> 02:48:09.680 align:start position:0%
for a director of school counseling that
 
02:48:12.710 --> 02:48:12.720 align:start position:0%
was going to fall under the bureau of
 
02:48:15.269 --> 02:48:15.279 align:start position:0%
student support has that
 
02:48:15.279 --> 02:48:16.710 align:start position:0%
student support has that
position

02:48:16.710 --> 02:48:16.720 align:start position:0%
position
 
02:48:20.150 --> 02:48:20.160 align:start position:0%
been eliminated or
 
02:48:21.910 --> 02:48:21.920 align:start position:0%
i know it hasn't been filled because
 
02:48:25.349 --> 02:48:25.359 align:start position:0%
there's no person in that job but
 
02:48:27.670 --> 02:48:27.680 align:start position:0%
what has happened to that position
 
02:48:29.429 --> 02:48:29.439 align:start position:0%
so we have a number of positions that
 
02:48:32.550 --> 02:48:32.560 align:start position:0%
work directly with school counselors
 
02:48:34.469 --> 02:48:34.479 align:start position:0%
it's not directly relevant to this bill
 
02:48:36.070 --> 02:48:36.080 align:start position:0%
but i'm happy to follow up on a
 
02:48:37.990 --> 02:48:38.000 align:start position:0%
historical position about what you're
 
02:48:38.000 --> 02:48:41.830 align:start position:0%
historical position about what you're
asking

02:48:41.830 --> 02:48:41.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:41.840 --> 02:48:42.830 align:start position:0%
 
represent

02:48:42.830 --> 02:48:42.840 align:start position:0%
represent
 
02:48:44.870 --> 02:48:44.880 align:start position:0%
tanner thank you and thank you for
 
02:48:47.190 --> 02:48:47.200 align:start position:0%
taking my question will you be working
 
02:48:49.349 --> 02:48:49.359 align:start position:0%
with the giving and going alliance also
 
02:48:52.870 --> 02:48:52.880 align:start position:0%
for the christian academies
 
02:48:54.790 --> 02:48:54.800 align:start position:0%
so the giving and going alliance did
 
02:48:55.750 --> 02:48:55.760 align:start position:0%
tell us that they did not want to
 
02:48:57.990 --> 02:48:58.000 align:start position:0%
participate this time around when we did
 
02:49:00.389 --> 02:49:00.399 align:start position:0%
our first contract this summer however
 
02:49:02.630 --> 02:49:02.640 align:start position:0%
we will be releasing an rfp shortly at
 
02:49:05.110 --> 02:49:05.120 align:start position:0%
the department and any organization that
 
02:49:07.750 --> 02:49:07.760 align:start position:0%
is registered under 77 g
 
02:49:09.590 --> 02:49:09.600 align:start position:0%
is more than willing or more than able
 
02:49:12.550 --> 02:49:12.560 align:start position:0%
to apply for the for the
 
02:49:12.560 --> 02:49:15.269 align:start position:0%
to apply for the for the
contract

02:49:15.269 --> 02:49:15.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:17.830 --> 02:49:17.840 align:start position:0%
thank you representative porter
 
02:49:19.830 --> 02:49:19.840 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you ladies
 
02:49:22.550 --> 02:49:22.560 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
 
02:49:23.670 --> 02:49:23.680 align:start position:0%
in the
 
02:49:26.230 --> 02:49:26.240 align:start position:0%
version of the freedom account bill that
 
02:49:27.830 --> 02:49:27.840 align:start position:0%
passed in the budget
 
02:49:30.150 --> 02:49:30.160 align:start position:0%
it said that the
 
02:49:32.870 --> 02:49:32.880 align:start position:0%
scholarship granting organization would
 
02:49:34.870 --> 02:49:34.880 align:start position:0%
be able to decide
 
02:49:37.110 --> 02:49:37.120 align:start position:0%
which programs
 
02:49:40.630 --> 02:49:40.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:43.349 --> 02:49:43.359 align:start position:0%
for coverage under this program
 
02:49:45.510 --> 02:49:45.520 align:start position:0%
would this position
 
02:49:47.590 --> 02:49:47.600 align:start position:0%
be able to do that instead of the
 
02:49:49.750 --> 02:49:49.760 align:start position:0%
organization i mean would they be making
 
02:49:49.760 --> 02:49:51.190 align:start position:0%
organization i mean would they be making
decisions

02:49:51.190 --> 02:49:51.200 align:start position:0%
decisions
 
02:49:53.030 --> 02:49:53.040 align:start position:0%
about which program
 
02:49:54.870 --> 02:49:54.880 align:start position:0%
should could be funded with these
 
02:49:58.710 --> 02:49:58.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:00.790 --> 02:50:00.800 align:start position:0%
so under current statute we do review
 
02:50:02.630 --> 02:50:02.640 align:start position:0%
the application process for education
 
02:50:04.309 --> 02:50:04.319 align:start position:0%
service providers and that
 
02:50:05.830 --> 02:50:05.840 align:start position:0%
responsibility would be a part of this
 
02:50:07.830 --> 02:50:07.840 align:start position:0%
position but again the scholarship
 
02:50:10.469 --> 02:50:10.479 align:start position:0%
organization directly receives those
 
02:50:10.479 --> 02:50:11.990 align:start position:0%
organization directly receives those
in

02:50:11.990 --> 02:50:12.000 align:start position:0%
in
 
02:50:13.990 --> 02:50:14.000 align:start position:0%
applications and reviews the education
 
02:50:16.150 --> 02:50:16.160 align:start position:0%
service providers who
 
02:50:16.160 --> 02:50:17.110 align:start position:0%
service providers who
are

02:50:17.110 --> 02:50:17.120 align:start position:0%
are
 
02:50:20.870 --> 02:50:20.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:23.990 --> 02:50:24.000 align:start position:0%
follow-up is are there guidelines that
 
02:50:26.150 --> 02:50:26.160 align:start position:0%
the department will be offering to the
 
02:50:28.389 --> 02:50:28.399 align:start position:0%
scholarship granting organization to
 
02:50:31.510 --> 02:50:31.520 align:start position:0%
help them make those decisions
 
02:50:32.950 --> 02:50:32.960 align:start position:0%
for example
 
02:50:35.830 --> 02:50:35.840 align:start position:0%
um how does the organization or the
 
02:50:38.710 --> 02:50:38.720 align:start position:0%
department decide which um religious
 
02:50:40.950 --> 02:50:40.960 align:start position:0%
school would be funded
 
02:50:43.429 --> 02:50:43.439 align:start position:0%
i mean what which schools of which
 
02:50:46.469 --> 02:50:46.479 align:start position:0%
religion would be funded
 
02:50:46.479 --> 02:50:47.150 align:start position:0%
religion would be funded
so

02:50:47.150 --> 02:50:47.160 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:50:50.070 --> 02:50:50.080 align:start position:0%
determinations uh upon eligib um
 
02:50:51.830 --> 02:50:51.840 align:start position:0%
different determinations of eligibility
 
02:50:55.349 --> 02:50:55.359 align:start position:0%
on the basis of religion would be um
 
02:50:58.469 --> 02:50:58.479 align:start position:0%
likely unconstitutional um so i'm not
 
02:51:00.309 --> 02:51:00.319 align:start position:0%
sure that that would be a relevant
 
02:51:03.510 --> 02:51:03.520 align:start position:0%
criteria in the the religious nature or
 
02:51:05.510 --> 02:51:05.520 align:start position:0%
the the specific
 
02:51:08.150 --> 02:51:08.160 align:start position:0%
religion associated with an education
 
02:51:09.590 --> 02:51:09.600 align:start position:0%
service provider
 
02:51:10.710 --> 02:51:10.720 align:start position:0%
but for
 
02:51:10.720 --> 02:51:12.870 align:start position:0%
but for
those

02:51:12.870 --> 02:51:12.880 align:start position:0%
those
 
02:51:15.830 --> 02:51:15.840 align:start position:0%
criterion related to the provision of a
 
02:51:19.110 --> 02:51:19.120 align:start position:0%
high quality education to a student
 
02:51:21.110 --> 02:51:21.120 align:start position:0%
an administrator could certainly advise
 
02:51:24.950 --> 02:51:24.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:26.150 --> 02:51:26.160 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any further
 
02:51:28.389 --> 02:51:28.399 align:start position:0%
representation thank you
 
02:51:29.830 --> 02:51:29.840 align:start position:0%
thank you for being here
 
02:51:29.840 --> 02:51:30.790 align:start position:0%
thank you for being here
um

02:51:30.790 --> 02:51:30.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:51:32.389 --> 02:51:32.399 align:start position:0%
am i
 
02:51:35.030 --> 02:51:35.040 align:start position:0%
correct in that this is not a voucher
 
02:51:37.429 --> 02:51:37.439 align:start position:0%
program and that a voucher is not given
 
02:51:41.670 --> 02:51:41.680 align:start position:0%
to a family to go to a particular school
 
02:51:43.910 --> 02:51:43.920 align:start position:0%
but in effect is an education savings
 
02:51:43.920 --> 02:51:45.030 align:start position:0%
but in effect is an education savings
account

02:51:45.030 --> 02:51:45.040 align:start position:0%
account
 
02:51:47.510 --> 02:51:47.520 align:start position:0%
program and there are
 
02:51:50.469 --> 02:51:50.479 align:start position:0%
a list in the legislation of valid
 
02:51:52.469 --> 02:51:52.479 align:start position:0%
expenses for which

these bills 1630 right down to 11 44
 
04:02:28.239 --> 04:02:29.030 align:start position:0%
these bills 1630 right down to 11 44
uh

04:02:29.030 --> 04:02:29.040 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:02:31.189 --> 04:02:31.199 align:start position:0%
the way this agenda for the afternoon is
 
04:02:32.389 --> 04:02:32.399 align:start position:0%
put together
 
04:02:33.990 --> 04:02:34.000 align:start position:0%
we have a number of bills are dealing
 
04:02:37.030 --> 04:02:37.040 align:start position:0%
with various aspects of curriculum
 
04:02:40.150 --> 04:02:40.160 align:start position:0%
be it pe be it labor history be it uh
 
04:02:40.160 --> 04:02:41.510 align:start position:0%
be it pe be it labor history be it uh
philosophy

04:02:41.510 --> 04:02:41.520 align:start position:0%
philosophy
 
04:02:44.389 --> 04:02:44.399 align:start position:0%
uh all civics
 
04:02:46.389 --> 04:02:46.399 align:start position:0%
i know that there are some folks who may
 
04:02:48.870 --> 04:02:48.880 align:start position:0%
be testifying on various bills some
 
04:02:50.950 --> 04:02:50.960 align:start position:0%
maybe on all bills
 
04:02:53.349 --> 04:02:53.359 align:start position:0%
and there may be a common thought
 
04:02:54.870 --> 04:02:54.880 align:start position:0%
through all those bills seeing we're
 
04:02:57.269 --> 04:02:57.279 align:start position:0%
dealing with curriculum
 
04:02:57.279 --> 04:02:58.550 align:start position:0%
dealing with curriculum
and

04:02:58.550 --> 04:02:58.560 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:03:01.030 --> 04:03:01.040 align:start position:0%
i've suggested to one individual that
 
04:03:03.269 --> 04:03:03.279 align:start position:0%
came up here during lunch break
 
04:03:06.550 --> 04:03:06.560 align:start position:0%
if you are testifying on all these bills
 
04:03:08.710 --> 04:03:08.720 align:start position:0%
but there's a common thread you can
 
04:03:10.309 --> 04:03:10.319 align:start position:0%
mention that at the beginning of the
 
04:03:11.990 --> 04:03:12.000 align:start position:0%
first bill here
 
04:03:15.030 --> 04:03:15.040 align:start position:0%
and you can sign the blue sheets
 
04:03:18.070 --> 04:03:18.080 align:start position:0%
and and indicate your position on on
 
04:03:20.309 --> 04:03:20.319 align:start position:0%
each bill on those blue sheets and
 
04:03:22.469 --> 04:03:22.479 align:start position:0%
submit written testimony
 
04:03:25.030 --> 04:03:25.040 align:start position:0%
but rather than reproducing or saying
 
04:03:27.590 --> 04:03:27.600 align:start position:0%
over and over and over again
 
04:03:29.750 --> 04:03:29.760 align:start position:0%
this one position
 
04:03:31.349 --> 04:03:31.359 align:start position:0%
you don't have to do that we understand
 
04:03:33.990 --> 04:03:34.000 align:start position:0%
it sorry so that way we may be able to
 
04:03:36.710 --> 04:03:36.720 align:start position:0%
get through this in a way that without
 
04:03:38.150 --> 04:03:38.160 align:start position:0%
you know hearing the same thing over and
 
04:03:40.870 --> 04:03:40.880 align:start position:0%
over and in a timely manner of course we
 
04:03:42.630 --> 04:03:42.640 align:start position:0%
are bound by a
 
04:03:45.110 --> 04:03:45.120 align:start position:0%
schedule that's here but uh
 
04:03:46.870 --> 04:03:46.880 align:start position:0%
that would i think that would help it
 
04:03:49.110 --> 04:03:49.120 align:start position:0%
might even help those who are here that
 
04:03:50.790 --> 04:03:50.800 align:start position:0%
would like to get out
 
04:03:52.710 --> 04:03:52.720 align:start position:0%
and get on with other affairs that
 
04:03:54.389 --> 04:03:54.399 align:start position:0%
they're dealing with so
 
04:03:57.189 --> 04:03:57.199 align:start position:0%
so that that advice is given right now
 
04:03:59.110 --> 04:03:59.120 align:start position:0%
to all who might be willing wanting to
 
04:04:00.870 --> 04:04:00.880 align:start position:0%
testify on this bill
 
04:04:02.950 --> 04:04:02.960 align:start position:0%

due to illness
 
04:06:09.510 --> 04:06:09.520 align:start position:0%
and out of an abundance of caution
 
04:06:11.269 --> 04:06:11.279 align:start position:0%
this bill looks to require introduction
 
04:06:13.590 --> 04:06:13.600 align:start position:0%
to philosophy the level of wisdom to be
 
04:06:15.590 --> 04:06:15.600 align:start position:0%
taught as a half year course in high
 
04:06:15.600 --> 04:06:16.550 align:start position:0%
taught as a half year course in high
school

04:06:16.550 --> 04:06:16.560 align:start position:0%
school
 
04:06:18.469 --> 04:06:18.479 align:start position:0%
i'm not one to go
 
04:06:20.630 --> 04:06:20.640 align:start position:0%
dictating and micromanaging what should
 
04:06:23.030 --> 04:06:23.040 align:start position:0%
be taught in our schools especially in a
 
04:06:25.269 --> 04:06:25.279 align:start position:0%
world exponentially increasing
 
04:06:25.279 --> 04:06:26.469 align:start position:0%
world exponentially increasing
information

04:06:26.469 --> 04:06:26.479 align:start position:0%
information
 
04:06:29.349 --> 04:06:29.359 align:start position:0%
but there are some core essentials
 
04:06:32.469 --> 04:06:32.479 align:start position:0%
one must be wise choose wisely
 
04:06:34.469 --> 04:06:34.479 align:start position:0%
what the essential foundational tools
 
04:06:37.269 --> 04:06:37.279 align:start position:0%
are and let people pursue their areas of
 
04:06:40.309 --> 04:06:40.319 align:start position:0%
interest as they see fit
 
04:06:42.150 --> 04:06:42.160 align:start position:0%
first let me be clear
 
04:06:44.950 --> 04:06:44.960 align:start position:0%
up clear clear up what i mean by
 
04:06:48.070 --> 04:06:48.080 align:start position:0%
philosophy i do not mean philosophy as a
 
04:06:51.189 --> 04:06:51.199 align:start position:0%
form of ideology but as a means of
 
04:06:51.199 --> 04:06:52.550 align:start position:0%
form of ideology but as a means of
inquiry

04:06:52.550 --> 04:06:52.560 align:start position:0%
inquiry
 
04:06:54.469 --> 04:06:54.479 align:start position:0%
this is not about teaching students what
 
04:06:57.429 --> 04:06:57.439 align:start position:0%
to think but about how to think
 
04:07:00.710 --> 04:07:00.720 align:start position:0%
question and inquire to understand that
 
04:07:03.910 --> 04:07:03.920 align:start position:0%
there is an anatomy to acknowledge and
 
04:07:06.309 --> 04:07:06.319 align:start position:0%
degrees of certainty to understand the
 
04:07:08.950 --> 04:07:08.960 align:start position:0%
age-old philosophical question how do
 
04:07:11.349 --> 04:07:11.359 align:start position:0%
you know that you know
 
04:07:13.670 --> 04:07:13.680 align:start position:0%
this is why the bill specifies the areas
 
04:07:15.030 --> 04:07:15.040 align:start position:0%
of philosophy
 
04:07:16.950 --> 04:07:16.960 align:start position:0%
that should be covered theory of
 
04:07:16.960 --> 04:07:18.150 align:start position:0%
that should be covered theory of
knowledge

in the past year we had a bill that
 
04:07:26.870 --> 04:07:26.880 align:start position:0%
touched on some of these issues
 
04:07:29.750 --> 04:07:29.760 align:start position:0%
i chose to make a broader approach this
 
04:07:31.349 --> 04:07:31.359 align:start position:0%
with this bill

uh
 
04:08:32.469 --> 04:08:32.479 align:start position:0%
number three
 
04:08:34.710 --> 04:08:34.720 align:start position:0%
school not a number of years is an
 
04:08:36.149 --> 04:08:36.159 align:start position:0%
elementary principal in elementary
 
04:08:36.159 --> 04:08:37.189 align:start position:0%

schools
 
04:08:41.510 --> 04:08:41.520 align:start position:0%
and curriculum is uh an area that i love
 
04:08:44.630 --> 04:08:44.640 align:start position:0%
and i feel this part of that core of
 
04:08:46.630 --> 04:08:46.640 align:start position:0%
what we do along with instruction and
 
04:08:48.550 --> 04:08:48.560 align:start position:0%
alignment of assessment and school
 
04:08:51.590 --> 04:08:51.600 align:start position:0%
facilities to make our education safe
 
04:08:53.349 --> 04:08:53.359 align:start position:0%
productive and a learning experience
 
04:08:57.269 --> 04:08:57.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:58.950 --> 04:08:58.960 align:start position:0%
as a as a
 
04:09:00.870 --> 04:09:00.880 align:start position:0%
elementary school principal
 
04:09:02.309 --> 04:09:02.319 align:start position:0%
i wrote a number of curriculum
 
04:09:03.830 --> 04:09:03.840 align:start position:0%
throughout the state one of the
 
04:09:05.510 --> 04:09:05.520 align:start position:0%
curriculum was developed and written in
 
04:09:06.950 --> 04:09:06.960 align:start position:0%
the state of maine it's now owned by
 
04:09:08.950 --> 04:09:08.960 align:start position:0%
downeast magazine it dealt with the
 
04:09:11.349 --> 04:09:11.359 align:start position:0%
social studies but though when i was up
 
04:09:12.790 --> 04:09:12.800 align:start position:0%
in alaska
 
04:09:14.870 --> 04:09:14.880 align:start position:0%
as the school principal there
 
04:09:17.110 --> 04:09:17.120 align:start position:0%
one of the areas that we very much got
 
04:09:20.950 --> 04:09:20.960 align:start position:0%
involved with in teaching how to think
 
04:09:23.429 --> 04:09:23.439 align:start position:0%
came from a program called great books
 
04:09:26.790 --> 04:09:26.800 align:start position:0%
foundation the junior great books
 
04:09:28.710 --> 04:09:28.720 align:start position:0%
right here some of you may be familiar
 
04:09:32.229 --> 04:09:32.239 align:start position:0%
as educators what this disk did
 
04:09:36.469 --> 04:09:36.479 align:start position:0%
it's a a system of shared inquiry
 
04:09:38.389 --> 04:09:38.399 align:start position:0%
you read the story once you get the
 
04:09:40.630 --> 04:09:40.640 align:start position:0%
facts you read it again you have a lot
 
04:09:42.070 --> 04:09:42.080 align:start position:0%
of discussion amongst people in the
 
04:09:44.070 --> 04:09:44.080 align:start position:0%
classroom and you get into different
 
04:09:45.429 --> 04:09:45.439 align:start position:0%
types of questioning
 
04:09:47.269 --> 04:09:47.279 align:start position:0%
questioning for facts questioning for
 
04:09:47.279 --> 04:09:48.630 align:start position:0%
questioning for facts questioning for
interpretation

04:09:48.630 --> 04:09:48.640 align:start position:0%
interpretation
 
04:09:50.870 --> 04:09:50.880 align:start position:0%
questioning for evaluation what do you
 
04:09:52.550 --> 04:09:52.560 align:start position:0%
think about the story what was the
 
04:09:54.870 --> 04:09:54.880 align:start position:0%
author trying to convey to us you'll
 
04:09:57.110 --> 04:09:57.120 align:start position:0%
find that there's many many cases not a
 
04:09:58.630 --> 04:09:58.640 align:start position:0%
correct answer
 
04:10:00.309 --> 04:10:00.319 align:start position:0%
there's many answers that can make
 
04:10:02.309 --> 04:10:02.319 align:start position:0%
things correct and many different ways
 
04:10:04.710 --> 04:10:04.720 align:start position:0%
of perceiving and seeing
 
04:10:07.510 --> 04:10:07.520 align:start position:0%
teaching the best ways to think on your
 
04:10:10.710 --> 04:10:10.720 align:start position:0%
own is what this program is all about
 
04:10:12.790 --> 04:10:12.800 align:start position:0%
it's how to think
 
04:10:15.510 --> 04:10:15.520 align:start position:0%
and we did this starting in the younger
 
04:10:17.910 --> 04:10:17.920 align:start position:0%
grades by then i'm saying write down in
 
04:10:20.389 --> 04:10:20.399 align:start position:0%
first grade right in kindergarten all
 
04:10:22.149 --> 04:10:22.159 align:start position:0%
the way up through junior high school
 
04:10:23.590 --> 04:10:23.600 align:start position:0%
the school the grades i had in that
 
04:10:25.269 --> 04:10:25.279 align:start position:0%
particular building
 
04:10:28.950 --> 04:10:28.960 align:start position:0%
and what we did we learned that
 
04:10:31.830 --> 04:10:31.840 align:start position:0%
the philosophy of of learning how you
 
04:10:31.840 --> 04:10:32.790 align:start position:0%
the philosophy of of learning how you
learn

04:10:32.790 --> 04:10:32.800 align:start position:0%
learn
 
04:10:34.790 --> 04:10:34.800 align:start position:0%
the logic and the rhetoric that's
 
04:10:37.429 --> 04:10:37.439 align:start position:0%
necessary are key components to how we
 
04:10:37.439 --> 04:10:39.110 align:start position:0%
necessary are key components to how we
learn

04:10:39.110 --> 04:10:39.120 align:start position:0%
learn
 
04:10:39.120 --> 04:10:40.469 align:start position:0%
learn
so

04:10:40.469 --> 04:10:40.479 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:10:43.349 --> 04:10:43.359 align:start position:0%
i feel that from my perspective
 
04:10:44.950 --> 04:10:44.960 align:start position:0%
we can't just start this at one grade
 
04:10:46.790 --> 04:10:46.800 align:start position:0%
level in high school and have a
 
04:10:48.389 --> 04:10:48.399 align:start position:0%
philosophy course say there you've got
 
04:10:50.630 --> 04:10:50.640 align:start position:0%
it it's a way of thinking it's aware of
 
04:10:53.750 --> 04:10:53.760 align:start position:0%
shared learning and shared understanding
 
04:10:56.070 --> 04:10:56.080 align:start position:0%
and shared in inquiry
 
04:10:58.389 --> 04:10:58.399 align:start position:0%
which is important too many times you
 
04:10:59.590 --> 04:10:59.600 align:start position:0%
read a book
 
04:11:01.510 --> 04:11:01.520 align:start position:0%
and you always go into next next section
 
04:11:02.950 --> 04:11:02.960 align:start position:0%
see what happens
 
04:11:05.110 --> 04:11:05.120 align:start position:0%
and and seeing that basic concrete
 
04:11:08.070 --> 04:11:08.080 align:start position:0%
sequential type information the facts
 
04:11:09.670 --> 04:11:09.680 align:start position:0%
but then we have to sort through the
 
04:11:11.269 --> 04:11:11.279 align:start position:0%
facts and find out why is it being
 
04:11:13.429 --> 04:11:13.439 align:start position:0%
written how does it relate to me how
 
04:11:14.790 --> 04:11:14.800 align:start position:0%
does it relate to you with my other
 
04:11:16.790 --> 04:11:16.800 align:start position:0%
classmates that's the discussion that
 
04:11:18.389 --> 04:11:18.399 align:start position:0%
gets you to the higher order thinking
 
04:11:21.830 --> 04:11:21.840 align:start position:0%
skills this is why when we had hb 242
 
04:11:25.349 --> 04:11:25.359 align:start position:0%
before us in the previous year
 
04:11:27.670 --> 04:11:27.680 align:start position:0%
we note that in that bill we talked
 
04:11:29.990 --> 04:11:30.000 align:start position:0%
about logic and rhetoric
 
04:11:30.000 --> 04:11:30.790 align:start position:0%
about logic and rhetoric
key

04:11:30.790 --> 04:11:30.800 align:start position:0%
key
 
04:11:34.309 --> 04:11:34.319 align:start position:0%
components to learning key components
 
04:11:36.550 --> 04:11:36.560 align:start position:0%
learning the core foundational elements
 
04:11:38.149 --> 04:11:38.159 align:start position:0%
that are part of
 
04:11:38.159 --> 04:11:39.750 align:start position:0%
that are part of
education

04:11:39.750 --> 04:11:39.760 align:start position:0%
education
 
04:11:39.760 --> 04:11:40.710 align:start position:0%
education
and

04:11:40.710 --> 04:11:40.720 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:11:43.830 --> 04:11:43.840 align:start position:0%
we saw it then and we need to see it now
 
04:11:46.149 --> 04:11:46.159 align:start position:0%
that anything we do we're going to have
 
04:11:48.950 --> 04:11:48.960 align:start position:0%
to be looking at those components logic
 
04:11:50.710 --> 04:11:50.720 align:start position:0%
how you think and
 
04:11:52.950 --> 04:11:52.960 align:start position:0%
rhetoric how we communicate
 
04:11:55.110 --> 04:11:55.120 align:start position:0%
so with that i will
 
04:11:57.110 --> 04:11:57.120 align:start position:0%
stop my testimony i'll take questions
 
04:11:58.790 --> 04:11:58.800 align:start position:0%
from my perspective but i can't take
 
04:12:01.429 --> 04:12:01.439 align:start position:0%
questions for representative saudi
 
04:12:03.830 --> 04:12:03.840 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any questions
 
04:12:07.349 --> 04:12:07.359 align:start position:0%
from the committee representative lakas
 
04:12:09.030 --> 04:12:09.040 align:start position:0%
since we're going to be dealing with a
 
04:12:10.870 --> 04:12:10.880 align:start position:0%
lot of bills that have to do with
 
04:12:10.880 --> 04:12:12.070 align:start position:0%
lot of bills that have to do with
curriculum

04:12:12.070 --> 04:12:12.080 align:start position:0%
curriculum
 
04:12:14.389 --> 04:12:14.399 align:start position:0%
can you explain
 
04:12:17.189 --> 04:12:17.199 align:start position:0%
now as we're getting started basically
 
04:12:20.229 --> 04:12:20.239 align:start position:0%
what our role in curriculum is what the
 
04:12:23.590 --> 04:12:23.600 align:start position:0%
does role is and what the town's role is
 
04:12:25.510 --> 04:12:25.520 align:start position:0%
so we understand when we're looking at
 
04:12:25.520 --> 04:12:26.790 align:start position:0%
so we understand when we're looking at
these

04:12:26.790 --> 04:12:26.800 align:start position:0%
these
 
04:12:28.710 --> 04:12:28.720 align:start position:0%
within curriculum
 
04:12:31.269 --> 04:12:31.279 align:start position:0%
we have various targeting targeted
 
04:12:33.349 --> 04:12:33.359 align:start position:0%
learning expectations
 
04:12:35.189 --> 04:12:35.199 align:start position:0%
for our students which are learning
 
04:12:37.830 --> 04:12:37.840 align:start position:0%
those are called competencies
 
04:12:41.110 --> 04:12:41.120 align:start position:0%
curriculum and instruction curriculum is
 
04:12:43.429 --> 04:12:43.439 align:start position:0%
the material the outline of where we are
 
04:12:46.870 --> 04:12:46.880 align:start position:0%
what's in the course what's in a program
 
04:12:49.349 --> 04:12:49.359 align:start position:0%
and the instructional component the
 
04:12:51.990 --> 04:12:52.000 align:start position:0%
methodology how we teach
 
04:12:55.349 --> 04:12:55.359 align:start position:0%
is that of the instruction in that
 
04:12:58.790 --> 04:12:58.800 align:start position:0%
school or in that district it's a
 
04:13:00.790 --> 04:13:00.800 align:start position:0%
methodology you can go from one
 
04:13:02.229 --> 04:13:02.239 align:start position:0%
classroom to another and you're going to
 
04:13:03.670 --> 04:13:03.680 align:start position:0%
see different ways of communicating
 
04:13:05.990 --> 04:13:06.000 align:start position:0%
doesn't say one's right one's wrong
 
04:13:07.910 --> 04:13:07.920 align:start position:0%
it means there's different ways of
 
04:13:09.990 --> 04:13:10.000 align:start position:0%
structuring and organizing organizing
 
04:13:11.750 --> 04:13:11.760 align:start position:0%
your your
 
04:13:14.149 --> 04:13:14.159 align:start position:0%
imparting the areas of curriculum which
 
04:13:16.550 --> 04:13:16.560 align:start position:0%
we have to teach instruction is
 
04:13:18.070 --> 04:13:18.080 align:start position:0%
curriculum instruction two different
 
04:13:18.080 --> 04:13:19.670 align:start position:0%
curriculum instruction two different
things

04:13:19.670 --> 04:13:19.680 align:start position:0%
things
 
04:13:21.189 --> 04:13:21.199 align:start position:0%
and we do have our standards which
 
04:13:23.590 --> 04:13:23.600 align:start position:0%
associate with what we want as what are
 
04:13:26.149 --> 04:13:26.159 align:start position:0%
those academic standards that all should
 
04:13:28.790 --> 04:13:28.800 align:start position:0%
achieve to be competent and the
 
04:13:33.510 --> 04:13:33.520 align:start position:0%
curriculum is the material we use to
 
04:13:36.149 --> 04:13:36.159 align:start position:0%
get into it have those objectives which
 
04:13:37.590 --> 04:13:37.600 align:start position:0%
we're trying to learn
 
04:13:41.349 --> 04:13:41.359 align:start position:0%
identified and and uh how we teach so
 
04:13:43.910 --> 04:13:43.920 align:start position:0%
with instructions so i hope i can it's
 
04:13:45.429 --> 04:13:45.439 align:start position:0%
hard to answer that question in one
 
04:13:47.830 --> 04:13:47.840 align:start position:0%
brief sentence or two i hope that helps
 
04:13:49.590 --> 04:13:49.600 align:start position:0%
you a little bit
 
04:13:51.750 --> 04:13:51.760 align:start position:0%
thank you you're welcome thank you uh
 
04:13:53.830 --> 04:13:53.840 align:start position:0%
representative moffitt thank you mr
 
04:13:55.670 --> 04:13:55.680 align:start position:0%
thank you russian vlad for taking my
 
04:13:58.309 --> 04:13:58.319 align:start position:0%
question you'll recall that last term we
 
04:14:02.149 --> 04:14:02.159 align:start position:0%
had uh at hb 242 with regard to an
 
04:14:04.469 --> 04:14:04.479 align:start position:0%
adequate education which you spent a lot
 
04:14:06.149 --> 04:14:06.159 align:start position:0%
of time on which passed the house in the
 
04:14:08.149 --> 04:14:08.159 align:start position:0%
senate but the governor vetoed it so i'm
 
04:14:09.349 --> 04:14:09.359 align:start position:0%
just wondering
 
04:14:12.550 --> 04:14:12.560 align:start position:0%
how how do you do you see this
 
04:14:12.560 --> 04:14:14.550 align:start position:0%
how how do you do you see this
philosophy

04:14:14.550 --> 04:14:14.560 align:start position:0%
philosophy
 
04:14:17.189 --> 04:14:17.199 align:start position:0%
course potential requirement or how do
 
04:14:19.030 --> 04:14:19.040 align:start position:0%
you see philosophy tying into an
 
04:14:22.469 --> 04:14:22.479 align:start position:0%
adequate education or do you see i
 
04:14:25.349 --> 04:14:25.359 align:start position:0%
worked you used the word course
 
04:14:25.359 --> 04:14:27.590 align:start position:0%
worked you used the word course
and

04:14:27.590 --> 04:14:27.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:14:30.309 --> 04:14:30.319 align:start position:0%
the there's a lot of courses which we
 
04:14:33.110 --> 04:14:33.120 align:start position:0%
teach in fact if you look at your rules
 
04:14:38.469 --> 04:14:38.479 align:start position:0%
that have in 306 education 306 the uh
 
04:14:40.309 --> 04:14:40.319 align:start position:0%
in order to have a
 
04:14:42.149 --> 04:14:42.159 align:start position:0%
a public school that's approved in all
 
04:14:44.389 --> 04:14:44.399 align:start position:0%
we have these rules which identify the
 
04:14:46.389 --> 04:14:46.399 align:start position:0%
elective courses the primary courses you
 
04:14:48.229 --> 04:14:48.239 align:start position:0%
have to have in order to have those 20
 
04:14:51.750 --> 04:14:51.760 align:start position:0%
credits to graduate from high school
 
04:14:51.760 --> 04:14:53.670 align:start position:0%
credits to graduate from high school
the

04:14:53.670 --> 04:14:53.680 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:14:54.950 --> 04:14:54.960 align:start position:0%
how you think
 
04:14:56.870 --> 04:14:56.880 align:start position:0%
in my perspective is embedded in
 
04:14:59.990 --> 04:15:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:01.990 --> 04:15:02.000 align:start position:0%
if you're going to go the route of
 
04:15:04.950 --> 04:15:04.960 align:start position:0%
philosophy as a separate required course
 
04:15:08.950 --> 04:15:08.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:10.870 --> 04:15:10.880 align:start position:0%
are we adding something on top of what
 
04:15:12.710 --> 04:15:12.720 align:start position:0%
we already have and there's going to be
 
04:15:14.389 --> 04:15:14.399 align:start position:0%
some other issues associated with that
 
04:15:15.830 --> 04:15:15.840 align:start position:0%
there's going to be costs
 
04:15:17.510 --> 04:15:17.520 align:start position:0%
there's going to be certification
 
04:15:18.870 --> 04:15:18.880 align:start position:0%
requirements who's going to teach that
 
04:15:21.110 --> 04:15:21.120 align:start position:0%
course um
 
04:15:23.429 --> 04:15:23.439 align:start position:0%
i don't know if i'm necessarily agreeing
 
04:15:25.429 --> 04:15:25.439 align:start position:0%
with that i didn't come here to you know
 
04:15:27.110 --> 04:15:27.120 align:start position:0%
take a position on it right now i want
 
04:15:28.309 --> 04:15:28.319 align:start position:0%
to hear
 
04:15:30.710 --> 04:15:30.720 align:start position:0%
this committee discuss it a little bit
 
04:15:32.710 --> 04:15:32.720 align:start position:0%
however i'm uh
 
04:15:35.990 --> 04:15:36.000 align:start position:0%
believe that you can teach everything i
 
04:15:38.149 --> 04:15:38.159 align:start position:0%
talked about in the junior great books
 
04:15:38.159 --> 04:15:39.030 align:start position:0%
talked about in the junior great books
here

04:15:39.030 --> 04:15:39.040 align:start position:0%
here
 
04:15:41.429 --> 04:15:41.439 align:start position:0%
in this foundation this program whether
 
04:15:43.269 --> 04:15:43.279 align:start position:0%
you're doing it civics are you doing it
 
04:15:45.030 --> 04:15:45.040 align:start position:0%
in literature whether you're doing it
 
04:15:46.550 --> 04:15:46.560 align:start position:0%
and you're thinking on some other
 
04:15:48.870 --> 04:15:48.880 align:start position:0%
subject core area within your your
 
04:15:48.880 --> 04:15:50.229 align:start position:0%
subject core area within your your
school

04:15:50.229 --> 04:15:50.239 align:start position:0%
school
 
04:15:52.070 --> 04:15:52.080 align:start position:0%
we oftentimes will teach social studies
 
04:15:54.309 --> 04:15:54.319 align:start position:0%
via literature
 
04:15:56.389 --> 04:15:56.399 align:start position:0%
and in the literature class
 
04:15:58.149 --> 04:15:58.159 align:start position:0%
some schools may not do it they may have
 
04:16:00.710 --> 04:16:00.720 align:start position:0%
a straight textbook to do that it's
 
04:16:02.710 --> 04:16:02.720 align:start position:0%
really a local issue and how it's going
 
04:16:04.550 --> 04:16:04.560 align:start position:0%
to be conveyed in that school
 
04:16:06.950 --> 04:16:06.960 align:start position:0%
years ago we had some schools that had
 
04:16:08.710 --> 04:16:08.720 align:start position:0%
all the walls in the classroom some had
 
04:16:10.710 --> 04:16:10.720 align:start position:0%
no walls in the classroom some used
 
04:16:13.269 --> 04:16:13.279 align:start position:0%
inquiry science some did not use it you
 
04:16:14.870 --> 04:16:14.880 align:start position:0%
can go down the list
 
04:16:18.070 --> 04:16:18.080 align:start position:0%
and and so it's that's a local decision
 
04:16:19.429 --> 04:16:19.439 align:start position:0%
your school board has to make that
 
04:16:21.189 --> 04:16:21.199 align:start position:0%
decision and working with the
 
04:16:24.469 --> 04:16:24.479 align:start position:0%
instructors in that school
 
04:16:25.990 --> 04:16:26.000 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:16:28.950 --> 04:16:28.960 align:start position:0%
thank you president porter
 
04:16:30.389 --> 04:16:30.399 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you
 
04:16:32.630 --> 04:16:32.640 align:start position:0%
representative ladd i agree with you
 
04:16:35.590 --> 04:16:35.600 align:start position:0%
that um that is excellence in teaching
 
04:16:37.750 --> 04:16:37.760 align:start position:0%
and i agree with you and i want to point
 
04:16:39.349 --> 04:16:39.359 align:start position:0%
out that that kind of excellence in
 
04:16:41.830 --> 04:16:41.840 align:start position:0%
teaching is going on in classrooms and
 
04:16:44.070 --> 04:16:44.080 align:start position:0%
public schools all over the state i know
 
04:16:46.229 --> 04:16:46.239 align:start position:0%
for a fact because i've been in them and
 
04:16:48.950 --> 04:16:48.960 align:start position:0%
i've watched it happen from little kids
 
04:16:51.830 --> 04:16:51.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:53.510 --> 04:16:53.520 align:start position:0%
how would
 
04:16:55.429 --> 04:16:55.439 align:start position:0%
that method of teaching
 
04:16:57.590 --> 04:16:57.600 align:start position:0%
conflict with the
 
04:16:59.830 --> 04:16:59.840 align:start position:0%
restrictions that have currently been
 
04:17:03.110 --> 04:17:03.120 align:start position:0%
put into law about which topics
 
04:17:06.550 --> 04:17:06.560 align:start position:0%
can be discussed in this way
 
04:17:09.349 --> 04:17:09.359 align:start position:0%
i am hearing
 
04:17:10.790 --> 04:17:10.800 align:start position:0%
many people
 
04:17:13.110 --> 04:17:13.120 align:start position:0%
coming to me saying that they're finding
 
04:17:15.030 --> 04:17:15.040 align:start position:0%
themselves as teachers
 
04:17:18.469 --> 04:17:18.479 align:start position:0%
chilled or nervous about doing that kind
 
04:17:21.110 --> 04:17:21.120 align:start position:0%
of activity with their classes
 
04:17:24.870 --> 04:17:24.880 align:start position:0%
because of the recent um senate house
 
04:17:27.830 --> 04:17:27.840 align:start position:0%
bill sb2 that i was built to that put in
 
04:17:30.389 --> 04:17:30.399 align:start position:0%
the banned concepts language is that a
 
04:17:33.269 --> 04:17:33.279 align:start position:0%
question about this yeah i'm asking how
 
04:17:36.830 --> 04:17:36.840 align:start position:0%
he would in his opinion get around
 
04:17:39.990 --> 04:17:40.000 align:start position:0%
that restriction that teachers have now
 
04:17:42.469 --> 04:17:42.479 align:start position:0%
to continue to do the kind of deep
 
04:17:45.349 --> 04:17:45.359 align:start position:0%
inquiry and questioning of values back
 
04:17:47.750 --> 04:17:47.760 align:start position:0%
and forth between each other that you so
 
04:17:50.309 --> 04:17:50.319 align:start position:0%
highly praised in the junior great books
 
04:17:51.429 --> 04:17:51.439 align:start position:0%
thank you very much representative
 
04:17:51.439 --> 04:17:53.030 align:start position:0%
thank you very much representative
porter

04:17:53.030 --> 04:17:53.040 align:start position:0%
porter
 
04:17:54.950 --> 04:17:54.960 align:start position:0%
i don't believe
 
04:17:56.950 --> 04:17:56.960 align:start position:0%
what i've just spoken about is a
 
04:17:59.189 --> 04:17:59.199 align:start position:0%
restriction how you teach
 
04:18:02.469 --> 04:18:02.479 align:start position:0%
i think this this um
 
04:18:02.479 --> 04:18:03.830 align:start position:0%
i think this this um
methodology

04:18:03.830 --> 04:18:03.840 align:start position:0%
methodology
 
04:18:07.590 --> 04:18:07.600 align:start position:0%
should be applied to everything we do
 
04:18:10.790 --> 04:18:10.800 align:start position:0%
i i've seen classrooms where i i see
 
04:18:13.910 --> 04:18:13.920 align:start position:0%
children thriving and enjoying and
 
04:18:16.870 --> 04:18:16.880 align:start position:0%
respecting each other's opinion
 
04:18:19.349 --> 04:18:19.359 align:start position:0%
i think it's up to the teacher to be the
 
04:18:19.359 --> 04:18:20.469 align:start position:0%
i think it's up to the teacher to be the
guide

04:18:20.469 --> 04:18:20.479 align:start position:0%
guide
 
04:18:22.950 --> 04:18:22.960 align:start position:0%
and to
 
04:18:24.790 --> 04:18:24.800 align:start position:0%
and that takes a lot of training to know
 
04:18:27.030 --> 04:18:27.040 align:start position:0%
how to teach like this this is something
 
04:18:29.189 --> 04:18:29.199 align:start position:0%
you just don't graph off the shelves and
 
04:18:31.110 --> 04:18:31.120 align:start position:0%
start this is where in service is very
 
04:18:33.910 --> 04:18:33.920 align:start position:0%
necessary i don't believe that what's
 
04:18:36.630 --> 04:18:36.640 align:start position:0%
going on today's society should have any
 
04:18:38.149 --> 04:18:38.159 align:start position:0%
effect and i don't think the bill that
 
04:18:39.429 --> 04:18:39.439 align:start position:0%
you're trying to speak to is the
 
04:18:41.030 --> 04:18:41.040 align:start position:0%
discrimination bill
 
04:18:44.550 --> 04:18:44.560 align:start position:0%
i don't think that bill has any
 
04:18:47.670 --> 04:18:47.680 align:start position:0%
restrictions as far as what is taught i
 
04:18:49.750 --> 04:18:49.760 align:start position:0%
think it means you're not going to
 
04:18:52.070 --> 04:18:52.080 align:start position:0%
advocate yourself
 
04:18:55.990 --> 04:18:56.000 align:start position:0%
and push something uh to the kids and
 
04:18:59.110 --> 04:18:59.120 align:start position:0%
not be respectful of differing positions
 
04:19:01.189 --> 04:19:01.199 align:start position:0%
this whole concept of the junior great
 
04:19:04.710 --> 04:19:04.720 align:start position:0%
book program or inquiry uh
 
04:19:08.070 --> 04:19:08.080 align:start position:0%
shared inquiry is one where we respect
 
04:19:10.389 --> 04:19:10.399 align:start position:0%
the opinions of others within that
 
04:19:13.750 --> 04:19:13.760 align:start position:0%
classroom and and uh that's how things
 
04:19:15.269 --> 04:19:15.279 align:start position:0%
grow i don't think it's going to be a
 
04:19:17.910 --> 04:19:17.920 align:start position:0%
restrictive i don't think that
 
04:19:19.750 --> 04:19:19.760 align:start position:0%
what i'm advocating can be done
 
04:19:22.149 --> 04:19:22.159 align:start position:0%
irregardless it should be how we're
 
04:19:24.469 --> 04:19:24.479 align:start position:0%
doing things and have been doing things
 
04:19:26.309 --> 04:19:26.319 align:start position:0%
for years
 
04:19:28.630 --> 04:19:28.640 align:start position:0%
uh representative mullen
 
04:19:30.229 --> 04:19:30.239 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you
 
04:19:32.630 --> 04:19:32.640 align:start position:0%
representative vlad for taking my uh
 
04:19:32.640 --> 04:19:33.670 align:start position:0%
representative vlad for taking my uh
question

04:19:33.670 --> 04:19:33.680 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:19:35.670 --> 04:19:35.680 align:start position:0%
first of all as somebody who taught
 
04:19:37.750 --> 04:19:37.760 align:start position:0%
junior great books for a
 
04:19:39.830 --> 04:19:39.840 align:start position:0%
significant number of years and more
 
04:19:42.309 --> 04:19:42.319 align:start position:0%
recently than you
 
04:19:42.319 --> 04:19:44.149 align:start position:0%
recently than you
i

04:19:44.149 --> 04:19:44.159 align:start position:0%
i
 
04:19:46.550 --> 04:19:46.560 align:start position:0%
i just want to say how impressed i am
 
04:19:48.950 --> 04:19:48.960 align:start position:0%
that you could put your hands on your
 
04:19:52.550 --> 04:19:52.560 align:start position:0%
junior great books manual uh to bring it
 
04:19:54.870 --> 04:19:54.880 align:start position:0%
in here as exhibit a today and my
 
04:19:54.880 --> 04:19:56.309 align:start position:0%
in here as exhibit a today and my
question

04:19:56.309 --> 04:19:56.319 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:19:58.389 --> 04:19:58.399 align:start position:0%
is um
 
04:20:01.189 --> 04:20:01.199 align:start position:0%
because i agree with you that uh the
 
04:20:04.070 --> 04:20:04.080 align:start position:0%
process by which kids learn how to think
 
04:20:05.990 --> 04:20:06.000 align:start position:0%
is critically important
 
04:20:09.110 --> 04:20:09.120 align:start position:0%
i'm wondering if you uh
 
04:20:11.429 --> 04:20:11.439 align:start position:0%
would agree that starting in high school
 
04:20:15.110 --> 04:20:15.120 align:start position:0%
is a bit late i wonder whether or not
 
04:20:17.830 --> 04:20:17.840 align:start position:0%
this type of inquiry should in fact be
 
04:20:21.349 --> 04:20:21.359 align:start position:0%
started earlier in a child's education
 
04:20:24.229 --> 04:20:24.239 align:start position:0%
than as a standalone high school course
 
04:20:26.950 --> 04:20:26.960 align:start position:0%
i absolutely agree that
 
04:20:30.229 --> 04:20:30.239 align:start position:0%
this methodology of instruction shared
 
04:20:30.239 --> 04:20:31.269 align:start position:0%
this methodology of instruction shared
inquiry

04:20:31.269 --> 04:20:31.279 align:start position:0%
inquiry
 
04:20:34.149 --> 04:20:34.159 align:start position:0%
and learning how to read you read it
 
04:20:37.030 --> 04:20:37.040 align:start position:0%
once you read it again a second time
 
04:20:38.790 --> 04:20:38.800 align:start position:0%
that's part of the program
 
04:20:41.349 --> 04:20:41.359 align:start position:0%
and from that you discern fact you
 
04:20:43.349 --> 04:20:43.359 align:start position:0%
usually get that the first round
 
04:20:45.110 --> 04:20:45.120 align:start position:0%
then you get into interpretation and
 
04:20:48.309 --> 04:20:48.319 align:start position:0%
evaluation this should be done
 
04:20:50.149 --> 04:20:50.159 align:start position:0%
in the schools i had we started this
 
04:20:52.870 --> 04:20:52.880 align:start position:0%
program formally in third grade
 
04:20:55.590 --> 04:20:55.600 align:start position:0%
and we continued on through by the time
 
04:20:57.830 --> 04:20:57.840 align:start position:0%
i would walk into a classroom in sixth
 
04:20:59.269 --> 04:20:59.279 align:start position:0%
grade or one of my eighth grade
 
04:20:59.279 --> 04:21:00.389 align:start position:0%
grade or one of my eighth grade
classrooms

04:21:00.389 --> 04:21:00.399 align:start position:0%
classrooms
 
04:21:02.389 --> 04:21:02.399 align:start position:0%
the level of thinking
 
04:21:05.269 --> 04:21:05.279 align:start position:0%
was just wonderful we initially adopted
 
04:21:07.590 --> 04:21:07.600 align:start position:0%
this program for our gifted program we
 
04:21:10.149 --> 04:21:10.159 align:start position:0%
had a gifted program in the school a
 
04:21:12.870 --> 04:21:12.880 align:start position:0%
gifted teacher in that state gifted was
 
04:21:15.189 --> 04:21:15.199 align:start position:0%
funded totally
 
04:21:17.110 --> 04:21:17.120 align:start position:0%
and we had criteria for getting in that
 
04:21:20.630 --> 04:21:20.640 align:start position:0%
program the gifted teacher then
 
04:21:22.790 --> 04:21:22.800 align:start position:0%
teacher gifted not
 
04:21:26.389 --> 04:21:26.399 align:start position:0%
and i would say she was very gifted
 
04:21:26.399 --> 04:21:27.110 align:start position:0%
and i would say she was very gifted
but

04:21:27.110 --> 04:21:27.120 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:21:29.590 --> 04:21:29.600 align:start position:0%
then turned around and cooperatively and
 
04:21:32.070 --> 04:21:32.080 align:start position:0%
collaboratively we trained all teachers
 
04:21:34.870 --> 04:21:34.880 align:start position:0%
on that staff to get into the same venue
 
04:21:38.229 --> 04:21:38.239 align:start position:0%
which we did and with that we saw a
 
04:21:40.389 --> 04:21:40.399 align:start position:0%
level of support within the community
 
04:21:44.950 --> 04:21:44.960 align:start position:0%
the kids went on to do wonderful things
 
04:21:46.870 --> 04:21:46.880 align:start position:0%
so to answer your question
 
04:21:49.429 --> 04:21:49.439 align:start position:0%
yes it's important that this process
 
04:21:51.910 --> 04:21:51.920 align:start position:0%
begin in the elementary grades
 
04:21:55.670 --> 04:21:55.680 align:start position:0%
and i fear right now that we have kids
 
04:21:58.469 --> 04:21:58.479 align:start position:0%
that are in third grade now
 
04:22:00.790 --> 04:22:00.800 align:start position:0%
and when covet started they're probably
 
04:22:00.800 --> 04:22:02.870 align:start position:0%
and when covet started they're probably
kindergarteners

04:22:02.870 --> 04:22:02.880 align:start position:0%
kindergarteners
 
04:22:06.070 --> 04:22:06.080 align:start position:0%
and since that time grades one two and
 
04:22:07.269 --> 04:22:07.279 align:start position:0%
now three
 
04:22:09.030 --> 04:22:09.040 align:start position:0%
they've gone through everything that's a
 
04:22:11.030 --> 04:22:11.040 align:start position:0%
result of covid
 
04:22:13.030 --> 04:22:13.040 align:start position:0%
some of them not in school much some in
 
04:22:15.030 --> 04:22:15.040 align:start position:0%
school would you know the mass that i
 
04:22:16.309 --> 04:22:16.319 align:start position:0%
have around my neck here i should be
 
04:22:19.590 --> 04:22:19.600 align:start position:0%
wearing but there's a loss there's a
 
04:22:22.950 --> 04:22:22.960 align:start position:0%
loss in academics and we all know that
 
04:22:25.510 --> 04:22:25.520 align:start position:0%
my primary goal is that and see what
 
04:22:27.349 --> 04:22:27.359 align:start position:0%
have they missed they missed the
 
04:22:29.910 --> 04:22:29.920 align:start position:0%
development of all this
 
04:22:29.920 --> 04:22:31.030 align:start position:0%
development of all this
so

04:22:31.030 --> 04:22:31.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:22:33.750 --> 04:22:33.760 align:start position:0%
i would say that yes we can't lose sight
 
04:22:35.429 --> 04:22:35.439 align:start position:0%
the elementary schools
 
04:22:37.110 --> 04:22:37.120 align:start position:0%
everything you know need to know is
 
04:22:39.590 --> 04:22:39.600 align:start position:0%
learned in kindergarten but beyond that
 
04:22:41.750 --> 04:22:41.760 align:start position:0%
you all know that
 
04:22:44.830 --> 04:22:44.840 align:start position:0%
in the lower elementary grades extremely
 
04:22:47.189 --> 04:22:47.199 align:start position:0%
important especially i i enjoyed
 
04:22:49.110 --> 04:22:49.120 align:start position:0%
watching those fourth graders
 
04:22:51.269 --> 04:22:51.279 align:start position:0%
that's where you start seeing them
 
04:22:53.830 --> 04:22:53.840 align:start position:0%
going from that concrete organization
 
04:22:55.030 --> 04:22:55.040 align:start position:0%
into that
 
04:22:58.229 --> 04:22:58.239 align:start position:0%
this logic and that so it's a fun time
 
04:23:00.070 --> 04:23:00.080 align:start position:0%
for kids we need to start not just as
 
04:23:02.469 --> 04:23:02.479 align:start position:0%
high school half year course or that
 
04:23:04.469 --> 04:23:04.479 align:start position:0%
this needs to be
 
04:23:06.469 --> 04:23:06.479 align:start position:0%
ongoing just like we teach kids how to
 
04:23:08.950 --> 04:23:08.960 align:start position:0%
use the computers now and we don't wait
 
04:23:11.910 --> 04:23:11.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:14.710 --> 04:23:14.720 align:start position:0%
thank you any further questions
 
04:23:17.110 --> 04:23:17.120 align:start position:0%
oh sorry yes represent luna no thank
 
04:23:18.550 --> 04:23:18.560 align:start position:0%
thank you very much mr chair and thank
 
04:23:20.550 --> 04:23:20.560 align:start position:0%
you very much representative ladd
 
04:23:23.830 --> 04:23:23.840 align:start position:0%
for introducing the bill and sharing
 
04:23:26.870 --> 04:23:26.880 align:start position:0%
your um your experience connected to to
 
04:23:28.389 --> 04:23:28.399 align:start position:0%
this um
 
04:23:31.510 --> 04:23:31.520 align:start position:0%
just a a couple of more
 
04:23:33.910 --> 04:23:33.920 align:start position:0%
more i guess process
 
04:23:37.750 --> 04:23:37.760 align:start position:0%
related related questions but um
 
04:23:39.189 --> 04:23:39.199 align:start position:0%
will um
 
04:23:43.830 --> 04:23:43.840 align:start position:0%
would this bill increase the number of
 
04:23:45.910 --> 04:23:45.920 align:start position:0%
graduation credits
 
04:23:45.920 --> 04:23:46.710 align:start position:0%
graduation credits
that

04:23:46.710 --> 04:23:46.720 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:23:49.030 --> 04:23:49.040 align:start position:0%
that some that some students will need
 
04:23:51.189 --> 04:23:51.199 align:start position:0%
to achieve in order to
 
04:23:54.149 --> 04:23:54.159 align:start position:0%
to graduate high school in new hampshire
 
04:23:55.990 --> 04:23:56.000 align:start position:0%
i was hoping we would discuss that when
 
04:23:59.030 --> 04:23:59.040 align:start position:0%
we get into a committee uh look at this
 
04:24:01.030 --> 04:24:01.040 align:start position:0%
as i said i'm not really
 
04:24:03.269 --> 04:24:03.279 align:start position:0%
um i'm here to just give my own
 
04:24:04.870 --> 04:24:04.880 align:start position:0%
perspective and understanding i
 
04:24:06.630 --> 04:24:06.640 align:start position:0%
understand what represents saudi's doing
 
04:24:08.870 --> 04:24:08.880 align:start position:0%
he believes very much in philosophy as i
 
04:24:11.910 --> 04:24:11.920 align:start position:0%
do um however is this going to be an
 
04:24:13.830 --> 04:24:13.840 align:start position:0%
elective course it's going to be a shall
 
04:24:16.149 --> 04:24:16.159 align:start position:0%
everybody takes part in this course
 
04:24:16.159 --> 04:24:17.110 align:start position:0%
everybody takes part in this course
um

04:24:17.110 --> 04:24:17.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:24:19.349 --> 04:24:19.359 align:start position:0%
and if so there's going to be an expense
 
04:24:23.110 --> 04:24:23.120 align:start position:0%
to it right and then and then um just a
 
04:24:25.189 --> 04:24:25.199 align:start position:0%
a second part on this
 
04:24:27.750 --> 04:24:27.760 align:start position:0%
on line seven is the effective date 60
 
04:24:30.950 --> 04:24:30.960 align:start position:0%
days after passage um my from from your
 
04:24:33.429 --> 04:24:33.439 align:start position:0%
last answer i'm gathering that that this
 
04:24:37.030 --> 04:24:37.040 align:start position:0%
committee may do a deeper dive into
 
04:24:39.429 --> 04:24:39.439 align:start position:0%
i'm sure representative mullen if she in
 
04:24:41.030 --> 04:24:41.040 align:start position:0%
knowing that she's been involved with
 
04:24:43.750 --> 04:24:43.760 align:start position:0%
this you don't just do it in 60 days
 
04:24:43.760 --> 04:24:45.030 align:start position:0%
this you don't just do it in 60 days
right

04:24:45.030 --> 04:24:45.040 align:start position:0%
right
 
04:24:47.110 --> 04:24:47.120 align:start position:0%
this is a type of thing where
 
04:24:49.910 --> 04:24:49.920 align:start position:0%
you're going to get every you got to get
 
04:24:51.510 --> 04:24:51.520 align:start position:0%
you got to get a good hold on it you got
 
04:24:53.189 --> 04:24:53.199 align:start position:0%
to go through doing it yourself you got
 
04:24:54.550 --> 04:24:54.560 align:start position:0%
to have all the in service and the
 
04:24:57.510 --> 04:24:57.520 align:start position:0%
preparation for it um we sent teachers
 
04:24:59.830 --> 04:24:59.840 align:start position:0%
where i was in alaska down to the states
 
04:25:02.389 --> 04:25:02.399 align:start position:0%
for further training by that i mean out
 
04:25:04.309 --> 04:25:04.319 align:start position:0%
down to the lower 48.
 
04:25:08.070 --> 04:25:08.080 align:start position:0%
and um so uh it would take
 
04:25:10.149 --> 04:25:10.159 align:start position:0%
i would say to get this done properly
 
04:25:11.670 --> 04:25:11.680 align:start position:0%
you'd have to gradually get it built
 
04:25:13.269 --> 04:25:13.279 align:start position:0%
through because you know you can't just
 
04:25:16.389 --> 04:25:16.399 align:start position:0%
start popping this series seven
 
04:25:19.349 --> 04:25:19.359 align:start position:0%
on a a on a student that and and some of
 
04:25:20.630 --> 04:25:20.640 align:start position:0%
the things you're looking at within
 
04:25:23.030 --> 04:25:23.040 align:start position:0%
those guides in the han for the teacher
 
04:25:25.030 --> 04:25:25.040 align:start position:0%
in the sixth grade without any previous
 
04:25:26.790 --> 04:25:26.800 align:start position:0%
understandings where you've got to build
 
04:25:28.309 --> 04:25:28.319 align:start position:0%
towards this
 
04:25:30.790 --> 04:25:30.800 align:start position:0%
and so it's a way of thinking it's a
 
04:25:32.309 --> 04:25:32.319 align:start position:0%
thinking which is absolutely we need
 
04:25:34.870 --> 04:25:34.880 align:start position:0%
more of in our society and we've got to
 
04:25:36.870 --> 04:25:36.880 align:start position:0%
be respecting those opinions
 
04:25:39.510 --> 04:25:39.520 align:start position:0%
that this espouses
 
04:25:41.750 --> 04:25:41.760 align:start position:0%
from different opinions thank you
 
04:25:44.070 --> 04:25:44.080 align:start position:0%
thank you any further questions seeing
 
04:25:46.469 --> 04:25:46.479 align:start position:0%

04:26:11.030 --> 04:26:11.040 align:start position:0%
need some amendment as as
 
04:26:13.030 --> 04:26:13.040 align:start position:0%
we talked about in the
 
04:26:14.550 --> 04:26:14.560 align:start position:0%
in the discussion just now to give
 
04:26:15.910 --> 04:26:15.920 align:start position:0%
schools a little more time to prepare
 
04:26:17.429 --> 04:26:17.439 align:start position:0%
and possibly a little more flexibility
 
04:26:19.110 --> 04:26:19.120 align:start position:0%
to meet the requirement
 
04:26:22.870 --> 04:26:22.880 align:start position:0%
but i do support the notion of requiring
 
04:26:25.510 --> 04:26:25.520 align:start position:0%
a philosophy credit for graduation for
 
04:26:27.750 --> 04:26:27.760 align:start position:0%
high school students in this state
 
04:26:29.189 --> 04:26:29.199 align:start position:0%
and the reason for this it's really
 
04:26:31.429 --> 04:26:31.439 align:start position:0%
twofold first of all
 
04:26:33.510 --> 04:26:33.520 align:start position:0%
philosophy is relevant to whatever you
 
04:26:33.520 --> 04:26:34.309 align:start position:0%
philosophy is relevant to whatever you
do

04:26:34.309 --> 04:26:34.319 align:start position:0%
do
 
04:26:36.950 --> 04:26:36.960 align:start position:0%
i am a political scientist by training
 
04:26:38.950 --> 04:26:38.960 align:start position:0%
but i use philosophy regularly and it
 
04:26:41.189 --> 04:26:41.199 align:start position:0%
and there is a philosophy of whatever it
 
04:26:42.790 --> 04:26:42.800 align:start position:0%
is you do
 
04:26:45.670 --> 04:26:45.680 align:start position:0%
the philosophy can tell you
 
04:26:47.830 --> 04:26:47.840 align:start position:0%
um for instance if you're a scientist
 
04:26:50.790 --> 04:26:50.800 align:start position:0%
what is the meaning and significance of
 
04:26:52.550 --> 04:26:52.560 align:start position:0%
the work that you're doing what is its
 
04:26:55.750 --> 04:26:55.760 align:start position:0%
value that is what is its end or purpose
 
04:26:57.590 --> 04:26:57.600 align:start position:0%
those are critical things for us to know
 
04:26:59.750 --> 04:26:59.760 align:start position:0%
and to be reflective about
 
04:27:02.229 --> 04:27:02.239 align:start position:0%
the kind of work we do and
 
04:27:04.950 --> 04:27:04.960 align:start position:0%
i i use philosophy very regularly in my
 
04:27:04.960 --> 04:27:06.550 align:start position:0%
i i use philosophy very regularly in my
work

04:27:06.550 --> 04:27:06.560 align:start position:0%
work
 
04:27:07.990 --> 04:27:08.000 align:start position:0%
the second reason
 
04:27:08.000 --> 04:27:09.590 align:start position:0%
the second reason
why

04:27:09.590 --> 04:27:09.600 align:start position:0%
why
 
04:27:12.309 --> 04:27:12.319 align:start position:0%
this requirement would be beneficial is
 
04:27:12.319 --> 04:27:13.910 align:start position:0%
this requirement would be beneficial is
that

04:27:13.910 --> 04:27:13.920 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:27:16.229 --> 04:27:16.239 align:start position:0%
as citizens
 
04:27:19.429 --> 04:27:19.439 align:start position:0%
we need access to some of these tools to
 
04:27:21.269 --> 04:27:21.279 align:start position:0%
solve some of the problems that we're
 
04:27:23.750 --> 04:27:23.760 align:start position:0%
having in our society in our politics
 
04:27:25.189 --> 04:27:25.199 align:start position:0%
one of the biggest problems i think
 
04:27:27.110 --> 04:27:27.120 align:start position:0%
everyone has noticed in our politics
 
04:27:29.910 --> 04:27:29.920 align:start position:0%
nowadays is an increase in tribalism and
 
04:27:31.750 --> 04:27:31.760 align:start position:0%
confirmation bias that is the the
 
04:27:33.590 --> 04:27:33.600 align:start position:0%
unwillingness to consider evidence that
 
04:27:35.189 --> 04:27:35.199 align:start position:0%
challenges your own views and we see
 
04:27:37.189 --> 04:27:37.199 align:start position:0%
this on on all sides of the political
 
04:27:37.199 --> 04:27:38.389 align:start position:0%
this on on all sides of the political
spectrum

04:27:38.389 --> 04:27:38.399 align:start position:0%
spectrum
 
04:27:38.399 --> 04:27:39.349 align:start position:0%
spectrum
and

04:27:39.349 --> 04:27:39.359 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:27:41.429 --> 04:27:41.439 align:start position:0%
philosophy instruction can help us get
 
04:27:43.429 --> 04:27:43.439 align:start position:0%
away from that by learning logic
 
04:27:45.110 --> 04:27:45.120 align:start position:0%
epistemology which is the theory of
 
04:27:45.120 --> 04:27:46.550 align:start position:0%
epistemology which is the theory of
knowledge

04:27:46.550 --> 04:27:46.560 align:start position:0%
knowledge
 
04:27:46.560 --> 04:27:47.590 align:start position:0%
knowledge
we

04:27:47.590 --> 04:27:47.600 align:start position:0%
we
 
04:27:50.149 --> 04:27:50.159 align:start position:0%
see that to to get at the truth
 
04:27:53.349 --> 04:27:53.359 align:start position:0%
we need to be curious but we also need
 
04:27:55.349 --> 04:27:55.359 align:start position:0%
to be dispassionate
 
04:27:57.429 --> 04:27:57.439 align:start position:0%
we need to not think of truth as an
 
04:28:00.229 --> 04:28:00.239 align:start position:0%
exercise in supporting our team whatever
 
04:28:01.349 --> 04:28:01.359 align:start position:0%
that may be
 
04:28:03.590 --> 04:28:03.600 align:start position:0%
but in actually challenging
 
04:28:04.790 --> 04:28:04.800 align:start position:0%
our team and challenging our
 
04:28:07.750 --> 04:28:07.760 align:start position:0%
preconceived notions and
 
04:28:10.389 --> 04:28:10.399 align:start position:0%
noticing recognizing logical fallacies
 
04:28:11.990 --> 04:28:12.000 align:start position:0%
and avoiding them in our reasoning
 
04:28:12.000 --> 04:28:13.429 align:start position:0%
and avoiding them in our reasoning
process

04:28:13.429 --> 04:28:13.439 align:start position:0%
process
 
04:28:13.439 --> 04:28:15.189 align:start position:0%
process
ideally

04:28:15.189 --> 04:28:15.199 align:start position:0%
ideally
 
04:28:18.309 --> 04:28:18.319 align:start position:0%
introducing students to logic
 
04:28:18.319 --> 04:28:19.349 align:start position:0%
introducing students to logic
to

04:28:19.349 --> 04:28:19.359 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:28:21.750 --> 04:28:21.760 align:start position:0%
logical fallacies teaching them how to
 
04:28:25.110 --> 04:28:25.120 align:start position:0%
avoid them teaching them the
 
04:28:26.950 --> 04:28:26.960 align:start position:0%
the means of getting at truth and the
 
04:28:29.910 --> 04:28:29.920 align:start position:0%
significance of truth is going to help
 
04:28:32.229 --> 04:28:32.239 align:start position:0%
them become better citizens
 
04:28:34.389 --> 04:28:34.399 align:start position:0%
more reflective
 
04:28:36.630 --> 04:28:36.640 align:start position:0%
more idiosyncratic if you will less
 
04:28:39.110 --> 04:28:39.120 align:start position:0%
willing to to toe a particular line but
 
04:28:41.670 --> 04:28:41.680 align:start position:0%
more willing to think for themselves
 
04:28:42.950 --> 04:28:42.960 align:start position:0%
very few
 
04:28:44.710 --> 04:28:44.720 align:start position:0%
high school students ever encounter
 
04:28:46.950 --> 04:28:46.960 align:start position:0%
philosophy before getting to college
 
04:28:49.990 --> 04:28:50.000 align:start position:0%
and therefore very few college students
 
04:28:51.189 --> 04:28:51.199 align:start position:0%
and i've taught that the collegiate
 
04:28:53.110 --> 04:28:53.120 align:start position:0%
level for nearly two decades
 
04:28:55.590 --> 04:28:55.600 align:start position:0%
very few college students ever even
 
04:28:57.910 --> 04:28:57.920 align:start position:0%
consider taking a philosophy course
 
04:28:59.429 --> 04:28:59.439 align:start position:0%
because they've never been introduced to
 
04:29:03.189 --> 04:29:03.199 align:start position:0%
it these are the biggest
 
04:29:03.199 --> 04:29:03.429 align:start position:0%
it these are the biggest
you questions

04:29:03.429 --> 04:29:03.439 align:start position:0%
you questions
 
04:29:07.429 --> 04:29:07.439 align:start position:0%
what is truth what is uh
 
04:29:09.990 --> 04:29:10.000 align:start position:0%
just in our society
 
04:29:12.229 --> 04:29:12.239 align:start position:0%
do human beings have free will do we
 
04:29:14.149 --> 04:29:14.159 align:start position:0%
have moral responsibility these sorts of
 
04:29:15.910 --> 04:29:15.920 align:start position:0%
questions are the questions that
 
04:29:18.149 --> 04:29:18.159 align:start position:0%
philosophy investigates they're
 
04:29:20.710 --> 04:29:20.720 align:start position:0%
questions relevant to all of us and yet
 
04:29:22.710 --> 04:29:22.720 align:start position:0%
very very few of us ever get to
 
04:29:25.110 --> 04:29:25.120 align:start position:0%
investigate them in a systematic manner
 
04:29:27.670 --> 04:29:27.680 align:start position:0%
because we're just not introduced to
 
04:29:30.149 --> 04:29:30.159 align:start position:0%
these ideas at any point in our academic
 
04:29:33.349 --> 04:29:33.359 align:start position:0%
careers so new hampshire could certainly
 
04:29:34.950 --> 04:29:34.960 align:start position:0%
take the lead here
 
04:29:34.960 --> 04:29:36.630 align:start position:0%
take the lead here
by

04:29:36.630 --> 04:29:36.640 align:start position:0%
by
 
04:29:38.389 --> 04:29:38.399 align:start position:0%
encouraging and even ultimately
 
04:29:40.870 --> 04:29:40.880 align:start position:0%
requiring schools to
 
04:29:42.870 --> 04:29:42.880 align:start position:0%
offer this course and to to require
 
04:29:44.550 --> 04:29:44.560 align:start position:0%
their students to take a course in
 
04:29:47.030 --> 04:29:47.040 align:start position:0%
philosophy perhaps we should
 
04:29:49.189 --> 04:29:49.199 align:start position:0%
allow extended learning opportunities to
 
04:29:52.630 --> 04:29:52.640 align:start position:0%
count perhaps it should make clear that
 
04:29:54.870 --> 04:29:54.880 align:start position:0%
a literature course or a civics course
 
04:29:56.710 --> 04:29:56.720 align:start position:0%
could also so long as it incorporates
 
04:29:58.469 --> 04:29:58.479 align:start position:0%
these elements fulfill the requirement
 
04:30:00.469 --> 04:30:00.479 align:start position:0%
those are possible amendments
 
04:30:02.309 --> 04:30:02.319 align:start position:0%
that would make this a
 
04:30:04.790 --> 04:30:04.800 align:start position:0%
less of a burden on schools
 
04:30:06.710 --> 04:30:06.720 align:start position:0%
but the idea is that students should be
 
04:30:09.269 --> 04:30:09.279 align:start position:0%
introduced to philosophy before they get
 
04:30:10.790 --> 04:30:10.800 align:start position:0%
to college
 
04:30:12.710 --> 04:30:12.720 align:start position:0%
and this bill would accomplish that
 
04:30:14.710 --> 04:30:14.720 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:30:16.469 --> 04:30:16.479 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony
 
04:30:17.910 --> 04:30:17.920 align:start position:0%
to us any
 
04:30:21.670 --> 04:30:21.680 align:start position:0%
questions representative moffat
 
04:30:24.149 --> 04:30:24.159 align:start position:0%
famous chair thank you to my question
 
04:30:25.990 --> 04:30:26.000 align:start position:0%
very interesting
 
04:30:28.389 --> 04:30:28.399 align:start position:0%
but you just said that this should be
 
04:30:30.790 --> 04:30:30.800 align:start position:0%
good for students to be exposed to or to
 
04:30:32.790 --> 04:30:32.800 align:start position:0%
have washed over them before they go to
 
04:30:32.800 --> 04:30:33.990 align:start position:0%
have washed over them before they go to
college

04:30:33.990 --> 04:30:34.000 align:start position:0%
college
 
04:30:36.070 --> 04:30:36.080 align:start position:0%
and when you said that you
 
04:30:38.309 --> 04:30:38.319 align:start position:0%
that it was a thought that i had
 
04:30:41.590 --> 04:30:41.600 align:start position:0%
having taught in high schools
 
04:30:43.990 --> 04:30:44.000 align:start position:0%
and i want to say this delicately
 
04:30:46.870 --> 04:30:46.880 align:start position:0%
uh i'm picturing a lot of
 
04:30:48.710 --> 04:30:48.720 align:start position:0%
my high school students
 
04:30:51.110 --> 04:30:51.120 align:start position:0%
is just not having any interest
 
04:30:54.149 --> 04:30:54.159 align:start position:0%
whatsoever in epistemology and that type
 
04:30:55.269 --> 04:30:55.279 align:start position:0%
of thing
 
04:30:56.950 --> 04:30:56.960 align:start position:0%
in some of the various
 
04:30:56.960 --> 04:30:58.149 align:start position:0%
in some of the various
school

04:30:58.149 --> 04:30:58.159 align:start position:0%
school
 
04:30:59.510 --> 04:30:59.520 align:start position:0%
you know schools of thought amongst
 
04:30:59.520 --> 04:31:00.710 align:start position:0%
you know schools of thought amongst
philosophers

04:31:00.710 --> 04:31:00.720 align:start position:0%
philosophers
 
04:31:02.469 --> 04:31:02.479 align:start position:0%
i agree with what you said about being
 
04:31:03.750 --> 04:31:03.760 align:start position:0%
good for
 
04:31:03.760 --> 04:31:05.429 align:start position:0%
good for
uh

04:31:05.429 --> 04:31:05.439 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:31:08.309 --> 04:31:08.319 align:start position:0%
college track students so that said in
 
04:31:10.710 --> 04:31:10.720 align:start position:0%
the in the
 
04:31:14.389 --> 04:31:14.399 align:start position:0%
the prime sponsor is not here if isn't
 
04:31:17.590 --> 04:31:17.600 align:start position:0%
do you see his intent as being this
 
04:31:20.070 --> 04:31:20.080 align:start position:0%
as a universal requirement or you just
 
04:31:20.080 --> 04:31:21.189 align:start position:0%
as a universal requirement or you just
said

04:31:21.189 --> 04:31:21.199 align:start position:0%
said
 
04:31:23.990 --> 04:31:24.000 align:start position:0%
for college-bound students what what do
 
04:31:25.750 --> 04:31:25.760 align:start position:0%
you think about that yeah well i've
 
04:31:27.349 --> 04:31:27.359 align:start position:0%
talked to representative saudi about
 
04:31:28.870 --> 04:31:28.880 align:start position:0%
this bill a little bit
 
04:31:28.880 --> 04:31:29.750 align:start position:0%
this bill a little bit
and

04:31:29.750 --> 04:31:29.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:31:31.429 --> 04:31:31.439 align:start position:0%
his his intention is that all high
 
04:31:33.510 --> 04:31:33.520 align:start position:0%
school students go through this class to
 
04:31:35.990 --> 04:31:36.000 align:start position:0%
see if this is something that does in
 
04:31:37.910 --> 04:31:37.920 align:start position:0%
fact interest them and it would be
 
04:31:40.389 --> 04:31:40.399 align:start position:0%
difficult to somehow limit this course
 
04:31:40.399 --> 04:31:41.189 align:start position:0%
difficult to somehow limit this course
to

04:31:41.189 --> 04:31:41.199 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:31:43.110 --> 04:31:43.120 align:start position:0%
to simply college-bound students how do
 
04:31:44.550 --> 04:31:44.560 align:start position:0%
you identify those students right how do
 
04:31:46.070 --> 04:31:46.080 align:start position:0%
we make this a requirement simply for
 
04:31:47.990 --> 04:31:48.000 align:start position:0%
those students could you try to get out
 
04:31:49.269 --> 04:31:49.279 align:start position:0%
of the requirement by claiming you're
 
04:31:53.030 --> 04:31:53.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:55.110 --> 04:31:55.120 align:start position:0%
i will say that what is distinctive and
 
04:31:57.349 --> 04:31:57.359 align:start position:0%
interesting about philosophy and why i
 
04:32:00.389 --> 04:32:00.399 align:start position:0%
um enjoy teaching what i get a chance to
 
04:32:02.309 --> 04:32:02.319 align:start position:0%
my my work is mainly in in political
 
04:32:03.670 --> 04:32:03.680 align:start position:0%
science as i've said but i have taught
 
04:32:05.110 --> 04:32:05.120 align:start position:0%
political philosophy
 
04:32:08.790 --> 04:32:08.800 align:start position:0%
is that everyone has some philosophical
 
04:32:11.189 --> 04:32:11.199 align:start position:0%
views we're human beings we can't help
 
04:32:13.510 --> 04:32:13.520 align:start position:0%
but have some philosophic philosophical
 
04:32:15.510 --> 04:32:15.520 align:start position:0%
views are there objective truths for
 
04:32:18.070 --> 04:32:18.080 align:start position:0%
instance people have opinions about that
 
04:32:21.030 --> 04:32:21.040 align:start position:0%
and the method of philosophy the the
 
04:32:22.790 --> 04:32:22.800 align:start position:0%
thought experiment is the main method
 
04:32:24.630 --> 04:32:24.640 align:start position:0%
whereby philosophy tries to get at the
 
04:32:26.309 --> 04:32:26.319 align:start position:0%
truth it's it's
 
04:32:30.389 --> 04:32:30.399 align:start position:0%
really reflecting on examples or um
 
04:32:33.269 --> 04:32:33.279 align:start position:0%
sort of situations um like the famous
 
04:32:36.070 --> 04:32:36.080 align:start position:0%
trolley example in ethics
 
04:32:38.389 --> 04:32:38.399 align:start position:0%
uh that gets you to
 
04:32:41.830 --> 04:32:41.840 align:start position:0%
um think about your premises and
 
04:32:43.590 --> 04:32:43.600 align:start position:0%
uh think about which sorts of premises
 
04:32:46.070 --> 04:32:46.080 align:start position:0%
are plausible that is a work that my
 
04:32:48.950 --> 04:32:48.960 align:start position:0%
students really enjoy doing and everyone
 
04:32:50.630 --> 04:32:50.640 align:start position:0%
can do that right everyone can sit and
 
04:32:52.630 --> 04:32:52.640 align:start position:0%
think if i were in that situation what
 
04:32:54.870 --> 04:32:54.880 align:start position:0%
would i think is the right thing to do
 
04:32:56.630 --> 04:32:56.640 align:start position:0%
it may be more difficult for students
 
04:32:57.830 --> 04:32:57.840 align:start position:0%
for instance to
 
04:33:00.389 --> 04:33:00.399 align:start position:0%
um to do biology than to do philosophy
 
04:33:02.630 --> 04:33:02.640 align:start position:0%
with biology you've got to have some
 
04:33:04.869 --> 04:33:04.879 align:start position:0%
facility with math you've got to
 
04:33:06.310 --> 04:33:06.320 align:start position:0%
understand something about the
 
04:33:07.990 --> 04:33:08.000 align:start position:0%
scientific method and those are all
 
04:33:10.070 --> 04:33:10.080 align:start position:0%
valuable things
 
04:33:11.910 --> 04:33:11.920 align:start position:0%
but i think philosophy is actually in
 
04:33:13.750 --> 04:33:13.760 align:start position:0%
some ways less challenging if
 
04:33:15.349 --> 04:33:15.359 align:start position:0%
appropriately taught at the high school
 
04:33:17.910 --> 04:33:17.920 align:start position:0%
level less challenging than for instance
 
04:33:19.349 --> 04:33:19.359 align:start position:0%
the natural sciences because it
 
04:33:21.349 --> 04:33:21.359 align:start position:0%
presupposes a little bit less in terms
 
04:33:24.150 --> 04:33:24.160 align:start position:0%
of technical skills
 
04:33:25.750 --> 04:33:25.760 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
04:33:27.349 --> 04:33:27.359 align:start position:0%
representative luno
 
04:33:28.869 --> 04:33:28.879 align:start position:0%
thank you very much mr chair and thank
 
04:33:30.709 --> 04:33:30.719 align:start position:0%
you very much dr sorens for uh for
 
04:33:32.629 --> 04:33:32.639 align:start position:0%
joining us this afternoon i was
 
04:33:34.629 --> 04:33:34.639 align:start position:0%
wondering if you could are hoping you
 
04:33:35.670 --> 04:33:35.680 align:start position:0%
could uh
 
04:33:38.949 --> 04:33:38.959 align:start position:0%
um comment on um you know what you just
 
04:33:40.789 --> 04:33:40.799 align:start position:0%
talked about particularly
 
04:33:43.189 --> 04:33:43.199 align:start position:0%
the invest you know the ability for
 
04:33:46.150 --> 04:33:46.160 align:start position:0%
students to investigate and explore i
 
04:33:47.750 --> 04:33:47.760 align:start position:0%
think i wrote down your words correctly
 
04:33:50.470 --> 04:33:50.480 align:start position:0%
evidence that challenges their own views
 
04:33:52.949 --> 04:33:52.959 align:start position:0%
and sort of you know crosswalk that or
 
04:33:54.470 --> 04:33:54.480 align:start position:0%
in juxtaposition
 
04:33:55.830 --> 04:33:55.840 align:start position:0%
with um
 
04:33:57.510 --> 04:33:57.520 align:start position:0%
with statutes we have here in new
 
04:33:59.029 --> 04:33:59.039 align:start position:0%
hampshire that actually ban the
 
04:34:02.230 --> 04:34:02.240 align:start position:0%
exploration of certain concepts
 
04:34:04.390 --> 04:34:04.400 align:start position:0%
yeah i've i've obviously followed the
 
04:34:07.109 --> 04:34:07.119 align:start position:0%
debate over that legislation um to be
 
04:34:08.869 --> 04:34:08.879 align:start position:0%
perfectly honest i'm not sure what i
 
04:34:11.109 --> 04:34:11.119 align:start position:0%
think about that legislation personally
 
04:34:13.510 --> 04:34:13.520 align:start position:0%
i've heard both proponents and opponents
 
04:34:15.429 --> 04:34:15.439 align:start position:0%
describe it differently
 
04:34:16.869 --> 04:34:16.879 align:start position:0%
and if the legislation is the way the
 
04:34:18.390 --> 04:34:18.400 align:start position:0%
opponents describe it i would oppose it
 
04:34:19.429 --> 04:34:19.439 align:start position:0%
at the legislation the way the
 
04:34:21.109 --> 04:34:21.119 align:start position:0%
proponents describe it i would support
 
04:34:22.789 --> 04:34:22.799 align:start position:0%
it we'll have to see how that gets
 
04:34:22.799 --> 04:34:24.070 align:start position:0%
it we'll have to see how that gets
interpreted

04:34:24.070 --> 04:34:24.080 align:start position:0%
interpreted
 
04:34:26.470 --> 04:34:26.480 align:start position:0%
certainly i do not think that that
 
04:34:28.629 --> 04:34:28.639 align:start position:0%
legislation should be interpreted at any
 
04:34:30.551 --> 04:34:30.561 align:start position:0%
rate um
 
04:34:32.230 --> 04:34:32.240 align:start position:0%
to prohibit the discussion of any
 
04:34:34.070 --> 04:34:34.080 align:start position:0%
concepts and if it does i think that
 
04:34:35.429 --> 04:34:35.439 align:start position:0%
would that is a problem with that
 
04:34:35.439 --> 04:34:36.709 align:start position:0%
would that is a problem with that
legislation

04:34:36.709 --> 04:34:36.719 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
04:34:37.910 --> 04:34:37.920 align:start position:0%
that's all
 
04:34:39.830 --> 04:34:39.840 align:start position:0%
i feel qualified to say about that well
 
04:34:42.470 --> 04:34:42.480 align:start position:0%
that's fine thank you very much sure
 
04:34:44.949 --> 04:34:44.959 align:start position:0%
any further questions from the committee
 
04:34:46.470 --> 04:34:46.480 align:start position:0%

04:35:15.429 --> 04:35:15.439 align:start position:0%
my name is jerry frew
 
04:35:17.269 --> 04:35:17.279 align:start position:0%
and i am the associate executive
 
04:35:19.109 --> 04:35:19.119 align:start position:0%
director for the new hampshire school

administrators association
 
04:35:23.670 --> 04:35:23.680 align:start position:0%
and out of respect for the time demands
 
04:35:25.429 --> 04:35:25.439 align:start position:0%
on this committee i'm going to offer
 
04:35:27.189 --> 04:35:27.199 align:start position:0%
testimony in writing
 
04:35:28.869 --> 04:35:28.879 align:start position:0%
i've provided it to
 
04:35:31.349 --> 04:35:31.359 align:start position:0%
legislative services and it will
 
04:35:33.590 --> 04:35:33.600 align:start position:0%
cover a number of curriculum related
 
04:35:35.269 --> 04:35:35.279 align:start position:0%
bills so i'll speak only once that will
 
04:35:36.869 --> 04:35:36.879 align:start position:0%
be now and
 
04:35:39.109 --> 04:35:39.119 align:start position:0%
as a matter of record for the committee
 
04:35:41.990 --> 04:35:42.000 align:start position:0%
our concerns will be
 
04:35:43.910 --> 04:35:43.920 align:start position:0%
in the record so that you have that to
 
04:35:45.670 --> 04:35:45.680 align:start position:0%
look at
 
04:35:48.789 --> 04:35:48.799 align:start position:0%
part of my role in my current position
 
04:35:50.629 --> 04:35:50.639 align:start position:0%
and actually part of my past life was
 
04:35:52.709 --> 04:35:52.719 align:start position:0%
working with curriculum
 
04:35:54.709 --> 04:35:54.719 align:start position:0%
today i currently work with curriculum
 
04:35:55.990 --> 04:35:56.000 align:start position:0%
directors and
 
04:35:56.000 --> 04:35:57.429 align:start position:0%
directors and
instructors

04:35:57.429 --> 04:35:57.439 align:start position:0%
instructors
 
04:35:59.269 --> 04:35:59.279 align:start position:0%
assistant superintendents and and the
 
04:36:01.349 --> 04:36:01.359 align:start position:0%
likes through professional development
 
04:36:03.590 --> 04:36:03.600 align:start position:0%
and in pretty regular contact with those
 
04:36:03.600 --> 04:36:04.709 align:start position:0%
and in pretty regular contact with those
folks

04:36:04.709 --> 04:36:04.719 align:start position:0%
folks
 
04:36:06.629 --> 04:36:06.639 align:start position:0%
i'd just like to ask a question of this
 
04:36:08.390 --> 04:36:08.400 align:start position:0%
committee if i may
 
04:36:10.230 --> 04:36:10.240 align:start position:0%
how many of you have ever
 
04:36:14.070 --> 04:36:14.080 align:start position:0%
been driving or ridden in a vehicle
 
04:36:16.949 --> 04:36:16.959 align:start position:0%
where that gas tank needle
 
04:36:20.789 --> 04:36:20.799 align:start position:0%
has come perilously close to empty
 
04:36:22.629 --> 04:36:22.639 align:start position:0%
and you've wondered if you're going to
 
04:36:25.510 --> 04:36:25.520 align:start position:0%
reach your destination
 
04:36:28.869 --> 04:36:28.879 align:start position:0%
and what the stress level and
 
04:36:32.150 --> 04:36:32.160 align:start position:0%
just kind of that visceral
 
04:36:33.670 --> 04:36:33.680 align:start position:0%
effect that you have
 
04:36:36.070 --> 04:36:36.080 align:start position:0%
in your body like oh my are we going to
 
04:36:38.629 --> 04:36:38.639 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:40.949 --> 04:36:40.959 align:start position:0%
i'm just going to fast forward that
 
04:36:43.429 --> 04:36:43.439 align:start position:0%
to the feeling right now of curriculum
 
04:36:43.439 --> 04:36:44.470 align:start position:0%
to the feeling right now of curriculum
folks

04:36:44.470 --> 04:36:44.480 align:start position:0%
folks
 
04:36:46.629 --> 04:36:46.639 align:start position:0%
and teachers in our classrooms
 
04:36:49.029 --> 04:36:49.039 align:start position:0%
and administrators in our buildings and
 
04:36:50.789 --> 04:36:50.799 align:start position:0%
school boards that have to make a lot of
 
04:36:50.799 --> 04:36:52.470 align:start position:0%
school boards that have to make a lot of
decisions

04:36:52.470 --> 04:36:52.480 align:start position:0%
decisions
 
04:36:53.670 --> 04:36:53.680 align:start position:0%
and tell you
 
04:36:55.590 --> 04:36:55.600 align:start position:0%
that in my weekly
 
04:36:58.310 --> 04:36:58.320 align:start position:0%
and sometimes daily communication with
 
04:36:59.670 --> 04:36:59.680 align:start position:0%
those folks
 
04:37:00.949 --> 04:37:00.959 align:start position:0%
the tank
 
04:37:04.230 --> 04:37:04.240 align:start position:0%
is darn near close to empty
 
04:37:07.990 --> 04:37:08.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:10.070 --> 04:37:10.080 align:start position:0%
and i just would like you to ponder that
 
04:37:12.150 --> 04:37:12.160 align:start position:0%
thought as you think about
 
04:37:13.670 --> 04:37:13.680 align:start position:0%
all of these
 
04:37:15.750 --> 04:37:15.760 align:start position:0%
very well intended
 
04:37:18.629 --> 04:37:18.639 align:start position:0%
pieces of curriculum legislation
 
04:37:21.910 --> 04:37:21.920 align:start position:0%
we appreciate the bill sponsors nhsaa
 
04:37:24.949 --> 04:37:24.959 align:start position:0%
appreciates each bill sponsor's concerns
 
04:37:28.070 --> 04:37:28.080 align:start position:0%
the passion the interest behind each
 
04:37:28.080 --> 04:37:29.429 align:start position:0%
the passion the interest behind each
proposal

04:37:29.429 --> 04:37:29.439 align:start position:0%
proposal
 
04:37:31.109 --> 04:37:31.119 align:start position:0%
by making this curriculum-related
 
04:37:33.189 --> 04:37:33.199 align:start position:0%
proposal each sponsor has created an
 
04:37:35.189 --> 04:37:35.199 align:start position:0%
awareness of the desire of many of our
 
04:37:37.990 --> 04:37:38.000 align:start position:0%
legislators to see changes in curriculum
 
04:37:39.990 --> 04:37:40.000 align:start position:0%
offerings and practices
 
04:37:42.551 --> 04:37:42.561 align:start position:0%
we encourage bill sponsors
 
04:37:45.189 --> 04:37:45.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:47.189 --> 04:37:47.199 align:start position:0%
with their local
 
04:37:49.750 --> 04:37:49.760 align:start position:0%
districts and constituents to make these
 
04:37:49.760 --> 04:37:50.949 align:start position:0%
districts and constituents to make these
changes

04:37:50.949 --> 04:37:50.959 align:start position:0%
changes
 
04:37:52.869 --> 04:37:52.879 align:start position:0%
a one-size-fits-all approach is not

on more than one occasion
 
04:38:04.949 --> 04:38:04.959 align:start position:0%

well intended but carry with them

22-23 school year
 
04:38:57.510 --> 04:38:57.520 align:start position:0%
we encourage each sponsor or legislator
 
04:38:59.269 --> 04:38:59.279 align:start position:0%
interested in changing the curriculum to
 
04:39:01.269 --> 04:39:01.279 align:start position:0%
work with their local school systems
 
04:39:03.349 --> 04:39:03.359 align:start position:0%
officials and communities to achieve
 
04:39:05.590 --> 04:39:05.600 align:start position:0%
those changes
 
04:39:07.990 --> 04:39:08.000 align:start position:0%
the very least we'll propose that any
 
04:39:10.629 --> 04:39:10.639 align:start position:0%
curriculum bill enacted be respectful of
 
04:39:13.510 --> 04:39:13.520 align:start position:0%
local capacity by allowing phased in or
 
04:39:15.910 --> 04:39:15.920 align:start position:0%
flexible timelines or implementation
 
04:39:18.470 --> 04:39:18.480 align:start position:0%
with none of it taking effect until july
 
04:39:21.269 --> 04:39:21.279 align:start position:0%
2024 at the earliest and be accompanied
 
04:39:24.789 --> 04:39:24.799 align:start position:0%
by a fiscal note to adequately implement
 
04:39:26.551 --> 04:39:26.561 align:start position:0%
the legislation
 
04:39:28.310 --> 04:39:28.320 align:start position:0%
this flexibility allows for local
 
04:39:29.910 --> 04:39:29.920 align:start position:0%
communities to plan for the fiscal
 
04:39:31.590 --> 04:39:31.600 align:start position:0%
impact of training
 
04:39:34.150 --> 04:39:34.160 align:start position:0%

04:39:36.310 --> 04:39:36.320 align:start position:0%

04:39:37.750 --> 04:39:37.760 align:start position:0%
these decisions
 
04:39:40.230 --> 04:39:40.240 align:start position:0%
the sheer volume of these bills imposes
 
04:39:43.110 --> 04:39:43.120 align:start position:0%
demands on local resources and bandwidth
 
04:39:45.750 --> 04:39:45.760 align:start position:0%
and with all due respect
 
04:39:47.350 --> 04:39:47.360 align:start position:0%
we ask this committee to look at these
 
04:39:49.990 --> 04:39:50.000 align:start position:0%
not only as individual bills but in sum
 
04:39:52.788 --> 04:39:52.798 align:start position:0%
total of all of these proposals as they
 
04:39:55.750 --> 04:39:55.760 align:start position:0%
impact local curriculum development
 
04:39:57.430 --> 04:39:57.440 align:start position:0%
it is with that thought in mind that we
 
04:39:58.788 --> 04:39:58.798 align:start position:0%
asked the committee to find each of
 
04:40:00.788 --> 04:40:00.798 align:start position:0%
these curriculum bills in expedient to
 
04:40:02.708 --> 04:40:02.718 align:start position:0%
legislate at this time
 
04:40:04.470 --> 04:40:04.480 align:start position:0%
or at least retain them for further
 
04:40:07.110 --> 04:40:07.120 align:start position:0%
study looking at the complete curriculum
 
04:40:09.670 --> 04:40:09.680 align:start position:0%
package as proposed by the legislature
 
04:40:11.430 --> 04:40:11.440 align:start position:0%
and we would be very happy to assist
 
04:40:12.868 --> 04:40:12.878 align:start position:0%
with that process
 
04:40:16.150 --> 04:40:16.160 align:start position:0%
but when you look at the cte bills the
 
04:40:19.270 --> 04:40:19.280 align:start position:0%

04:40:19.280 --> 04:40:20.868 align:start position:0%

04:40:23.430 --> 04:40:23.440 align:start position:0%
the nutrition half hour for lunch there
 
04:40:25.990 --> 04:40:26.000 align:start position:0%
are lots of things that impact a
 
04:40:29.830 --> 04:40:29.840 align:start position:0%
school's day time and quite honestly the
 
04:40:31.510 --> 04:40:31.520 align:start position:0%
human condition
 
04:40:32.708 --> 04:40:32.718 align:start position:0%
right now
 
04:40:34.788 --> 04:40:34.798 align:start position:0%
and or next summer nobody's going to
 
04:40:37.030 --> 04:40:37.040 align:start position:0%
attack the curriculum issues now or even
 
04:40:38.948 --> 04:40:38.958 align:start position:0%
in the fall it's going to be next summer
 
04:40:38.958 --> 04:40:40.868 align:start position:0%
in the fall it's going to be next summer
sometime

04:40:40.868 --> 04:40:40.878 align:start position:0%
sometime
 
04:40:44.390 --> 04:40:44.400 align:start position:0%
our administrators our teachers our
 
04:40:47.430 --> 04:40:47.440 align:start position:0%
school folks all need to come up for air
 
04:40:49.270 --> 04:40:49.280 align:start position:0%
that didn't happen this past summer they
 
04:40:51.190 --> 04:40:51.200 align:start position:0%
thought they might get a little just a
 
04:40:53.670 --> 04:40:53.680 align:start position:0%
little swig of that air and then bang
 
04:40:55.350 --> 04:40:55.360 align:start position:0%
they came back to school in september
 
04:40:57.510 --> 04:40:57.520 align:start position:0%
and the tsunami came again and so we've
 
04:41:00.310 --> 04:41:00.320 align:start position:0%
got another year of underwater
 
04:41:02.150 --> 04:41:02.160 align:start position:0%
and so i ask
 
04:41:03.750 --> 04:41:03.760 align:start position:0%
in compassion it's funny one of the
 
04:41:06.150 --> 04:41:06.160 align:start position:0%
pieces that that we've talked about one
 
04:41:07.590 --> 04:41:07.600 align:start position:0%
of the pieces that the curriculum
 
04:41:09.510 --> 04:41:09.520 align:start position:0%
directors have talked about is the
 
04:41:12.230 --> 04:41:12.240 align:start position:0%
frustration that they're experiencing in
 
04:41:13.590 --> 04:41:13.600 align:start position:0%
getting staff members to even
 
04:41:15.830 --> 04:41:15.840 align:start position:0%
participate in professional development
 
04:41:19.670 --> 04:41:19.680 align:start position:0%
like self-care and compassion fatigue
 
04:41:21.750 --> 04:41:21.760 align:start position:0%
they don't even have the wherewithal to
 
04:41:23.830 --> 04:41:23.840 align:start position:0%
be able to do those things and we're
 
04:41:26.310 --> 04:41:26.320 align:start position:0%
asking them now to spend time in the
 
04:41:26.320 --> 04:41:27.190 align:start position:0%
asking them now to spend time in the
summer

04:41:27.190 --> 04:41:27.200 align:start position:0%
summer
 
04:41:29.110 --> 04:41:29.120 align:start position:0%
to revamp curriculum
 
04:41:29.120 --> 04:41:29.910 align:start position:0%
to revamp curriculum
to

04:41:29.910 --> 04:41:29.920 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:41:31.670 --> 04:41:31.680 align:start position:0%
to make
 
04:41:34.628 --> 04:41:34.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:36.230 --> 04:41:36.240 align:start position:0%
hire more staff
 
04:41:38.150 --> 04:41:38.160 align:start position:0%
i think i think you've received that
 
04:41:39.510 --> 04:41:39.520 align:start position:0%
message and
 
04:41:41.750 --> 04:41:41.760 align:start position:0%
this testimony really satisfies
 
04:41:43.990 --> 04:41:44.000 align:start position:0%
testimony for about eight bills
 
04:41:46.470 --> 04:41:46.480 align:start position:0%
so the gift of time is yours and i'm
 
04:41:49.350 --> 04:41:49.360 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions thank you
 
04:41:50.550 --> 04:41:50.560 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:41:51.830 --> 04:41:51.840 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
04:41:53.190 --> 04:41:53.200 align:start position:0%
from the committee of representative
 
04:41:53.200 --> 04:41:56.230 align:start position:0%
from the committee of representative
lakers

04:41:56.230 --> 04:41:56.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:59.830 --> 04:41:59.840 align:start position:0%
if there are things that we would
 
04:42:01.750 --> 04:42:01.760 align:start position:0%
obviously there's a whole lot of things
 
04:42:06.628 --> 04:42:06.638 align:start position:0%
here that various of us want to see in
 
04:42:11.110 --> 04:42:11.120 align:start position:0%
what would be a way of doing that
 
04:42:13.990 --> 04:42:14.000 align:start position:0%
that would not
 
04:42:17.590 --> 04:42:17.600 align:start position:0%
negatively impact the schools
 
04:42:20.230 --> 04:42:20.240 align:start position:0%
could we you know just say make sure
 
04:42:23.110 --> 04:42:23.120 align:start position:0%
that in
 
04:42:24.708 --> 04:42:24.718 align:start position:0%
while you're teaching that you cover
 
04:42:27.510 --> 04:42:27.520 align:start position:0%
these things i don't know what what do
 
04:42:29.750 --> 04:42:29.760 align:start position:0%
what suggestions do you have for us
 
04:42:30.628 --> 04:42:30.638 align:start position:0%
thank you for that question
 
04:42:31.830 --> 04:42:31.840 align:start position:0%
representative like us and that is a
 
04:42:33.110 --> 04:42:33.120 align:start position:0%
great question
 
04:42:37.270 --> 04:42:37.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:38.788 --> 04:42:38.798 align:start position:0%
another part of my job is to make sure
 
04:42:40.150 --> 04:42:40.160 align:start position:0%
that they're aware of these pieces of
 
04:42:42.628 --> 04:42:42.638 align:start position:0%
legislation and so we explain the fact
 
04:42:45.110 --> 04:42:45.120 align:start position:0%
that these are conversations in concord
 
04:42:47.110 --> 04:42:47.120 align:start position:0%
that they need to look at i believe the
 
04:42:49.510 --> 04:42:49.520 align:start position:0%
other part is though also we have a
 
04:42:51.270 --> 04:42:51.280 align:start position:0%
department of education that has a
 
04:42:53.510 --> 04:42:53.520 align:start position:0%
bureau of student health and wellness
 
04:42:55.430 --> 04:42:55.440 align:start position:0%
i believe that some of the health and
 
04:42:58.868 --> 04:42:58.878 align:start position:0%
wellness bills and some of those things
 
04:43:00.550 --> 04:43:00.560 align:start position:0%
it's as simple as looking at local
 
04:43:02.150 --> 04:43:02.160 align:start position:0%
curriculum and seeing if those things
 
04:43:03.510 --> 04:43:03.520 align:start position:0%
are already covered i'm not quite sure
 
04:43:04.868 --> 04:43:04.878 align:start position:0%
that some of these proposals aren't
 
04:43:07.270 --> 04:43:07.280 align:start position:0%
already covered in local
 
04:43:09.910 --> 04:43:09.920 align:start position:0%
presentations i think sometimes at this
 
04:43:11.910 --> 04:43:11.920 align:start position:0%
level we have a tendency to hear from
 
04:43:13.590 --> 04:43:13.600 align:start position:0%
one or two outliers that are
 
04:43:16.310 --> 04:43:16.320 align:start position:0%
dissatisfied with the local situation
 
04:43:18.230 --> 04:43:18.240 align:start position:0%
and when we dig down and take a look at
 
04:43:20.868 --> 04:43:20.878 align:start position:0%
it we might find that many of these
 
04:43:23.430 --> 04:43:23.440 align:start position:0%
uh competencies many of these practices
 
04:43:25.190 --> 04:43:25.200 align:start position:0%
are already in place and i think that's
 
04:43:27.350 --> 04:43:27.360 align:start position:0%
the advantage if you will representative
 
04:43:30.310 --> 04:43:30.320 align:start position:0%
of of referring at least for further
 
04:43:31.590 --> 04:43:31.600 align:start position:0%
study because i think some of these
 
04:43:33.350 --> 04:43:33.360 align:start position:0%
things are already addressed i do agree
 
04:43:33.360 --> 04:43:34.390 align:start position:0%
things are already addressed i do agree
with

04:43:34.390 --> 04:43:34.400 align:start position:0%
with
 
04:43:37.110 --> 04:43:37.120 align:start position:0%
representative luno's question that uh
 
04:43:39.030 --> 04:43:39.040 align:start position:0%
as the current philosophy bill is
 
04:43:41.110 --> 04:43:41.120 align:start position:0%
written it would add a requirement for
 
04:43:42.868 --> 04:43:42.878 align:start position:0%
graduation i i think it was
 
04:43:44.708 --> 04:43:44.718 align:start position:0%
representative i'm not quite sure but i
 
04:43:46.230 --> 04:43:46.240 align:start position:0%
believe the way it's written it's a
 
04:43:46.240 --> 04:43:47.350 align:start position:0%
believe the way it's written it's a
required

04:43:47.350 --> 04:43:47.360 align:start position:0%
required
 
04:43:49.350 --> 04:43:49.360 align:start position:0%
course for graduation from high school i
 
04:43:51.830 --> 04:43:51.840 align:start position:0%
think anytime something is required it
 
04:43:54.070 --> 04:43:54.080 align:start position:0%
adds another layer it impedes that kid
 
04:43:55.670 --> 04:43:55.680 align:start position:0%
that's trying to get into the cte

04:46:01.840 --> 04:46:31.750 align:start position:0%
 
yes

04:46:31.750 --> 04:46:31.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:58.948 --> 04:46:58.958 align:start position:0%

hearing uh hb 1263 presented
 
04:47:12.470 --> 04:47:12.480 align:start position:0%
by jerry kanerk and i would like to say
 
04:47:14.310 --> 04:47:14.320 align:start position:0%
to jerry
 
04:47:17.350 --> 04:47:17.360 align:start position:0%
your penmanship is excellent
 
04:47:19.510 --> 04:47:19.520 align:start position:0%
i think i printed it i don't know if
 
04:47:21.430 --> 04:47:21.440 align:start position:0%
that was the palmer method or zayn or
 
04:47:24.070 --> 04:47:24.080 align:start position:0%
blowser but i can read it i think i use
 
04:47:26.628 --> 04:47:26.638 align:start position:0%
black caps because as i said my worst
 
04:47:28.628 --> 04:47:28.638 align:start position:0%
created all of school was penmanship my
 
04:47:33.350 --> 04:47:33.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:35.430 --> 04:47:35.440 align:start position:0%

04:47:39.440 --> 04:47:40.310 align:start position:0%
on the horn
um

04:47:40.310 --> 04:47:40.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:47:42.550 --> 04:47:42.560 align:start position:0%
perhaps when you introduce yourself
 
04:47:45.270 --> 04:47:45.280 align:start position:0%
you can also explain
 
04:47:47.190 --> 04:47:47.200 align:start position:0%

uh hear the bill hb 1263 introduced
 
04:48:00.470 --> 04:48:00.480 align:start position:0%
relative to fiscal education in schools
 
04:48:00.480 --> 04:48:01.430 align:start position:0%
relative to fiscal education in schools
welcome

04:48:01.430 --> 04:48:01.440 align:start position:0%
welcome
 
04:48:03.190 --> 04:48:03.200 align:start position:0%
thank you very much mr chair for the
 
04:48:05.030 --> 04:48:05.040 align:start position:0%
record my name is jerry kanerk
 
04:48:06.708 --> 04:48:06.718 align:start position:0%
representative carroll county
 
04:48:08.310 --> 04:48:08.320 align:start position:0%
representing carroll county district 3
 
04:48:09.670 --> 04:48:09.680 align:start position:0%
and i'm also a retired orthopedic
 
04:48:09.680 --> 04:48:11.030 align:start position:0%
and i'm also a retired orthopedic
surgeon

04:48:11.030 --> 04:48:11.040 align:start position:0%
surgeon
 
04:48:12.708 --> 04:48:12.718 align:start position:0%
um i was going to say this to the end
 
04:48:15.110 --> 04:48:15.120 align:start position:0%
but i will say it at this point
 
04:48:16.788 --> 04:48:16.798 align:start position:0%
the person who motivated me to file this
 
04:48:18.390 --> 04:48:18.400 align:start position:0%
bill is a fellow orthopedic surgeon and
 
04:48:21.110 --> 04:48:21.120 align:start position:0%
sports medicine specialist and educator
 
04:48:23.350 --> 04:48:23.360 align:start position:0%
dr dan o'neill who truly wrote the book
 
04:48:25.270 --> 04:48:25.280 align:start position:0%
on this topic titled survival of the fit
 
04:48:27.110 --> 04:48:27.120 align:start position:0%
he's here to testify today they're also
 
04:48:29.270 --> 04:48:29.280 align:start position:0%
doing a documentary about it and that is
 
04:48:31.270 --> 04:48:31.280 align:start position:0%
the reason why we have the person doing
 
04:48:33.670 --> 04:48:33.680 align:start position:0%
the filming nothing nefarious just
 
04:48:35.910 --> 04:48:35.920 align:start position:0%
getting ready for a documentary
 
04:48:38.390 --> 04:48:38.400 align:start position:0%
so basically 1263 sets a minimum
 
04:48:40.788 --> 04:48:40.798 align:start position:0%
requirement for time spent in physical
 
04:48:43.830 --> 04:48:43.840 align:start position:0%
education for pupils in school
 
04:48:45.350 --> 04:48:45.360 align:start position:0%
bottom line our kids are not active
 
04:48:47.270 --> 04:48:47.280 align:start position:0%
enough they fail to meet even minimum
 
04:48:49.430 --> 04:48:49.440 align:start position:0%
standards for fitness and this lack of
 
04:48:51.350 --> 04:48:51.360 align:start position:0%
physical activity is far-reaching with
 
04:48:53.190 --> 04:48:53.200 align:start position:0%
30 percent of our new england new
 
04:48:55.030 --> 04:48:55.040 align:start position:0%
hampshire children i should say being
 
04:48:57.430 --> 04:48:57.440 align:start position:0%
overweight uh 20 oh by the way just in
 
04:48:59.190 --> 04:48:59.200 align:start position:0%
case you know i did distribute this
 
04:49:01.670 --> 04:49:01.680 align:start position:0%
earlier so you had the testimony uh 20
 
04:49:03.910 --> 04:49:03.920 align:start position:0%
meeting the criteria for obesity and we
 
04:49:06.310 --> 04:49:06.320 align:start position:0%
have elevated rates of type 2 obesity or
 
04:49:08.470 --> 04:49:08.480 align:start position:0%
sorry diabetes in children
 
04:49:10.310 --> 04:49:10.320 align:start position:0%
this is probably the first generation in
 
04:49:12.550 --> 04:49:12.560 align:start position:0%
history is expected to have a shorter
 
04:49:15.030 --> 04:49:15.040 align:start position:0%
life span than their parents because of
 
04:49:17.190 --> 04:49:17.200 align:start position:0%
these kinds of chronic illnesses
 
04:49:18.868 --> 04:49:18.878 align:start position:0%
lack of fitness contributes also to
 
04:49:18.878 --> 04:49:19.910 align:start position:0%
lack of fitness contributes also to
depression

04:49:19.910 --> 04:49:19.920 align:start position:0%
depression
 
04:49:22.150 --> 04:49:22.160 align:start position:0%
stress and anxiety and really also it
 
04:49:24.470 --> 04:49:24.480 align:start position:0%
decreases school performance
 
04:49:25.750 --> 04:49:25.760 align:start position:0%
you gotta remember children are really
 
04:49:27.750 --> 04:49:27.760 align:start position:0%
born as very active beings they have a
 
04:49:30.150 --> 04:49:30.160 align:start position:0%
really strong physical identity and as
 
04:49:32.230 --> 04:49:32.240 align:start position:0%
the grandfather of a one-year-old boy at
 
04:49:34.310 --> 04:49:34.320 align:start position:0%
this point i've been really reintroduced
 
04:49:36.390 --> 04:49:36.400 align:start position:0%
to the incredible level of activity and
 
04:49:39.590 --> 04:49:39.600 align:start position:0%
exploration of young children but our
 
04:49:41.830 --> 04:49:41.840 align:start position:0%
current lifestyle allows children to
 
04:49:43.910 --> 04:49:43.920 align:start position:0%
spend their lives barely moving as they
 
04:49:45.190 --> 04:49:45.200 align:start position:0%
spend time in front of screens rather
 
04:49:46.868 --> 04:49:46.878 align:start position:0%
than going outside to either play or do
 
04:49:48.628 --> 04:49:48.638 align:start position:0%
chores milk the cows and so on and so
 
04:49:48.638 --> 04:49:49.590 align:start position:0%
chores milk the cows and so on and so
forth

04:49:49.590 --> 04:49:49.600 align:start position:0%
forth
 
04:49:51.190 --> 04:49:51.200 align:start position:0%
now we can address this problem by
 
04:49:53.270 --> 04:49:53.280 align:start position:0%
ensuring kids get at least a minimum
 
04:49:55.670 --> 04:49:55.680 align:start position:0%
level of physical activity every day to
 
04:49:57.510 --> 04:49:57.520 align:start position:0%
help preserve that physical activity
 
04:49:59.430 --> 04:49:59.440 align:start position:0%
that physical identity
 
04:50:01.590 --> 04:50:01.600 align:start position:0%
by introducing them to numerous physical
 
04:50:04.550 --> 04:50:04.560 align:start position:0%
activity choices especially outdoor
 
04:50:07.190 --> 04:50:07.200 align:start position:0%
individual outdoor activities not just
 
04:50:09.510 --> 04:50:09.520 align:start position:0%
team sports we can provide a foundation
 
04:50:11.670 --> 04:50:11.680 align:start position:0%
for an active lifestyle for the rest of
 
04:50:13.270 --> 04:50:13.280 align:start position:0%
their lives
 
04:50:15.750 --> 04:50:15.760 align:start position:0%
the cdc notes that physical education in
 
04:50:17.430 --> 04:50:17.440 align:start position:0%
the school improves grades and test
 
04:50:20.070 --> 04:50:20.080 align:start position:0%
scores and the ability to stay on task
 
04:50:21.430 --> 04:50:21.440 align:start position:0%
in the classroom
 
04:50:23.270 --> 04:50:23.280 align:start position:0%
and that the increased time spent on
 
04:50:25.990 --> 04:50:26.000 align:start position:0%
physical education does not negatively
 
04:50:27.830 --> 04:50:27.840 align:start position:0%
affect the student's academic
 
04:50:27.840 --> 04:50:29.190 align:start position:0%
affect the student's academic
achievement

04:50:29.190 --> 04:50:29.200 align:start position:0%
achievement
 
04:50:31.590 --> 04:50:31.600 align:start position:0%
the choice of 30 minutes per day for
 
04:50:33.350 --> 04:50:33.360 align:start position:0%
elementary school students and 45
 
04:50:35.110 --> 04:50:35.120 align:start position:0%
minutes per day for middle and high
 
04:50:36.470 --> 04:50:36.480 align:start position:0%
school students
 
04:50:38.550 --> 04:50:38.560 align:start position:0%
is based upon the institute's institutes
 
04:50:41.510 --> 04:50:41.520 align:start position:0%
of medicine 2013 report called
 
04:50:44.150 --> 04:50:44.160 align:start position:0%
evaluating the student body taking
 
04:50:46.550 --> 04:50:46.560 align:start position:0%
physio physical activity and physical
 
04:50:49.590 --> 04:50:49.600 align:start position:0%
education to school that laid out the
 
04:50:51.910 --> 04:50:51.920 align:start position:0%
scientific basis for the recommendations
 
04:50:55.350 --> 04:50:55.360 align:start position:0%
for physical education in schools
 
04:50:56.390 --> 04:50:56.400 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
04:50:57.670 --> 04:50:57.680 align:start position:0%
does not
 
04:51:00.150 --> 04:51:00.160 align:start position:0%
offer an exemption for team sports as
 
04:51:02.150 --> 04:51:02.160 align:start position:0%
children should be exposed to numerous
 
04:51:04.070 --> 04:51:04.080 align:start position:0%
individual life activities and some
 
04:51:06.868 --> 04:51:06.878 align:start position:0%
sports may not give much activity such
 
04:51:08.470 --> 04:51:08.480 align:start position:0%
as let's say you're on the baseball team
 
04:51:09.750 --> 04:51:09.760 align:start position:0%
you're playing right field you're not
 
04:51:11.670 --> 04:51:11.680 align:start position:0%
even a starter you may not get that much
 
04:51:13.430 --> 04:51:13.440 align:start position:0%
activity day to day as you're doing that
 
04:51:13.440 --> 04:51:14.708 align:start position:0%
activity day to day as you're doing that
sport

04:51:14.708 --> 04:51:14.718 align:start position:0%
sport
 
04:51:17.030 --> 04:51:17.040 align:start position:0%
organized sports are not sufficient as
 
04:51:19.270 --> 04:51:19.280 align:start position:0%
not everyone participates and children
 
04:51:21.190 --> 04:51:21.200 align:start position:0%
often segregate themselves into either
 
04:51:24.788 --> 04:51:24.798 align:start position:0%
athletes or non-athletes far too early
 
04:51:26.230 --> 04:51:26.240 align:start position:0%
i'm part an example i never did any
 
04:51:28.550 --> 04:51:28.560 align:start position:0%
sports at all but for my age group i'm
 
04:51:29.830 --> 04:51:29.840 align:start position:0%
probably one of the more active people
 
04:51:31.830 --> 04:51:31.840 align:start position:0%
you know with cross-country skiing and
 
04:51:33.430 --> 04:51:33.440 align:start position:0%
downhill skiing and hiking and biking
 
04:51:35.830 --> 04:51:35.840 align:start position:0%
and swimming and running i do that stuff
 
04:51:37.270 --> 04:51:37.280 align:start position:0%
all the day i can't get through a day
 
04:51:39.190 --> 04:51:39.200 align:start position:0%
without something that's outside i
 
04:51:40.868 --> 04:51:40.878 align:start position:0%
preserve my physical activity partly
 
04:51:42.628 --> 04:51:42.638 align:start position:0%
because my folks just sent me outside to
 
04:51:44.628 --> 04:51:44.638 align:start position:0%
play until the lights until the street
 
04:51:45.910 --> 04:51:45.920 align:start position:0%
lights came out
 
04:51:47.670 --> 04:51:47.680 align:start position:0%
in any case i'll be glad to take any
 
04:51:49.830 --> 04:51:49.840 align:start position:0%
questions if you have them but again
 
04:51:51.510 --> 04:51:51.520 align:start position:0%
the person who wrote the book is sitting
 
04:51:53.430 --> 04:51:53.440 align:start position:0%
behind me and he'll be testifying thank
 
04:51:54.788 --> 04:51:54.798 align:start position:0%
you very much representative are there
 
04:51:58.788 --> 04:51:58.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:01.110 --> 04:52:01.120 align:start position:0%
yes representative boehm
 
04:52:02.310 --> 04:52:02.320 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking the
 
04:52:02.320 --> 04:52:03.430 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking the
question

04:52:03.430 --> 04:52:03.440 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:52:03.440 --> 04:52:04.230 align:start position:0%
question
um

04:52:04.230 --> 04:52:04.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:52:07.350 --> 04:52:07.360 align:start position:0%
over the years we've done
 
04:52:08.550 --> 04:52:08.560 align:start position:0%
a lot of
 
04:52:10.550 --> 04:52:10.560 align:start position:0%
deep bill a couple of times if i
 
04:52:10.560 --> 04:52:11.670 align:start position:0%
deep bill a couple of times if i
remember

04:52:11.670 --> 04:52:11.680 align:start position:0%
remember
 
04:52:14.788 --> 04:52:14.798 align:start position:0%
the problem is as brought up and earlier
 
04:52:16.868 --> 04:52:16.878 align:start position:0%
that not enough time in the school day
 
04:52:18.628 --> 04:52:18.638 align:start position:0%
to do this now when i went to high
 
04:52:22.150 --> 04:52:22.160 align:start position:0%
school we'd had phys ed every day but
 
04:52:23.670 --> 04:52:23.680 align:start position:0%
the federal government and the state
 
04:52:25.990 --> 04:52:26.000 align:start position:0%
kept adding stuff and it was on
 
04:52:28.948 --> 04:52:28.958 align:start position:0%
department my question is on
 
04:52:31.430 --> 04:52:31.440 align:start position:0%
alternative education which we passed
 
04:52:33.030 --> 04:52:33.040 align:start position:0%
some years ago
 
04:52:36.150 --> 04:52:36.160 align:start position:0%
and i know in our high school we did it
 
04:52:36.160 --> 04:52:37.110 align:start position:0%
and i know in our high school we did it
with

04:52:37.110 --> 04:52:37.120 align:start position:0%
with
 
04:52:39.270 --> 04:52:39.280 align:start position:0%
depending on the number of
 
04:52:41.590 --> 04:52:41.600 align:start position:0%
what sport you were in
 
04:52:44.070 --> 04:52:44.080 align:start position:0%
that served as a half credit
 
04:52:46.390 --> 04:52:46.400 align:start position:0%
for example if you won the football team
 
04:52:48.390 --> 04:52:48.400 align:start position:0%
you only had to do one year if you have
 
04:52:52.550 --> 04:52:52.560 align:start position:0%
varsity only basketball varsity only
 
04:52:54.948 --> 04:52:54.958 align:start position:0%
my granddaughter did gymnastics for four
 
04:52:57.110 --> 04:52:57.120 align:start position:0%
years that was her alternative credit
 
04:52:59.750 --> 04:52:59.760 align:start position:0%
that's plenty of exercise so i think
 
04:53:02.948 --> 04:53:02.958 align:start position:0%
just leaving out the sports is wrong
 
04:53:05.190 --> 04:53:05.200 align:start position:0%
because there are some sports where no
 
04:53:06.788 --> 04:53:06.798 align:start position:0%
matter what position you play you're
 
04:53:08.310 --> 04:53:08.320 align:start position:0%
going to get a lot of exercise and you
 
04:53:08.320 --> 04:53:10.150 align:start position:0%
going to get a lot of exercise and you
agree

04:53:10.150 --> 04:53:10.160 align:start position:0%
agree
 
04:53:11.910 --> 04:53:11.920 align:start position:0%
yes actually i have to say
 
04:53:11.920 --> 04:53:12.708 align:start position:0%
yes actually i have to say
um

04:53:12.708 --> 04:53:12.718 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:53:14.708 --> 04:53:14.718 align:start position:0%
you know in our health human services
 
04:53:17.670 --> 04:53:17.680 align:start position:0%
elderly affairs we do a big job of you
 
04:53:19.510 --> 04:53:19.520 align:start position:0%
know tweaking bills
 
04:53:21.270 --> 04:53:21.280 align:start position:0%
you have the expertise in education that
 
04:53:23.030 --> 04:53:23.040 align:start position:0%
i do not have i would expect that
 
04:53:24.788 --> 04:53:24.798 align:start position:0%
together you will come up with something
 
04:53:26.150 --> 04:53:26.160 align:start position:0%
that would be far better than what i
 
04:53:28.708 --> 04:53:28.718 align:start position:0%
submitted thank you
 
04:53:30.550 --> 04:53:30.560 align:start position:0%
are there further questions from the
 
04:53:30.560 --> 04:53:31.670 align:start position:0%
are there further questions from the
committee

04:53:31.670 --> 04:53:31.680 align:start position:0%
committee
 
04:53:33.750 --> 04:53:33.760 align:start position:0%
yes representative nelson uh thank you
 
04:53:35.750 --> 04:53:35.760 align:start position:0%
mr chairman thank you for taking my
 
04:53:37.590 --> 04:53:37.600 align:start position:0%
question representative line six of the
 
04:53:37.600 --> 04:53:38.788 align:start position:0%
question representative line six of the
bill

04:53:38.788 --> 04:53:38.798 align:start position:0%
bill
 
04:53:40.788 --> 04:53:40.798 align:start position:0%
if you have it in front of you yes and
 
04:53:43.670 --> 04:53:43.680 align:start position:0%
the word or at the end of the sentence i
 
04:53:44.550 --> 04:53:44.560 align:start position:0%
don't know
 
04:53:46.948 --> 04:53:46.958 align:start position:0%
and the middle school or high school
 
04:53:48.628 --> 04:53:48.638 align:start position:0%
engages in a course of physical
 
04:53:51.990 --> 04:53:52.000 align:start position:0%
education for a minute 220 minimum 225
 
04:53:53.750 --> 04:53:53.760 align:start position:0%
minutes that means you get your choice
 
04:53:56.470 --> 04:53:56.480 align:start position:0%
middle or high school
 
04:53:58.150 --> 04:53:58.160 align:start position:0%
that's how i interpret it so i'm sorry
 
04:53:59.990 --> 04:54:00.000 align:start position:0%
if i'm wrong
 
04:54:01.590 --> 04:54:01.600 align:start position:0%
that is not what was intended it would
 
04:54:04.550 --> 04:54:04.560 align:start position:0%
be minimum 150 weeks for the elementary
 
04:54:06.310 --> 04:54:06.320 align:start position:0%
school and middle school or high school
 
04:54:08.070 --> 04:54:08.080 align:start position:0%
engages but it certainly could be
 
04:54:09.670 --> 04:54:09.680 align:start position:0%
changed and if that is confusing to
 
04:54:09.680 --> 04:54:10.788 align:start position:0%
changed and if that is confusing to
people

04:54:10.788 --> 04:54:10.798 align:start position:0%
people
 
04:54:12.260 --> 04:54:12.270 align:start position:0%
well i may be the only one
 
04:54:12.270 --> 04:54:13.990 align:start position:0%
well i may be the only one
[Laughter]

04:54:13.990 --> 04:54:14.000 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
04:54:15.430 --> 04:54:15.440 align:start position:0%
well if one is confused then it's
 
04:54:15.440 --> 04:54:17.190 align:start position:0%
well if one is confused then it's
confusing

04:54:17.190 --> 04:54:17.200 align:start position:0%
confusing
 
04:54:19.510 --> 04:54:19.520 align:start position:0%
are there further questions from the
 
04:54:21.510 --> 04:54:21.520 align:start position:0%
committee here
 
04:54:23.350 --> 04:54:23.360 align:start position:0%

i'm here to
 
04:55:28.230 --> 04:55:28.240 align:start position:0%
to testify today partly to amplify
 
04:55:30.470 --> 04:55:30.480 align:start position:0%
a testimony that you have from kathy
 
04:55:30.480 --> 04:55:33.030 align:start position:0%
a testimony that you have from kathy
robgen

04:55:33.030 --> 04:55:33.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:35.350 --> 04:55:35.360 align:start position:0%
who is a former colleague of mine and
 
04:55:37.590 --> 04:55:37.600 align:start position:0%
she was unable to attend today
 
04:55:41.510 --> 04:55:41.520 align:start position:0%
but she was an elementary teacher for
 
04:55:43.990 --> 04:55:44.000 align:start position:0%
several decades at kearsarge as well
 
04:55:46.470 --> 04:55:46.480 align:start position:0%
and she became the elementary school
 
04:55:49.430 --> 04:55:49.440 align:start position:0%
teacher of the year in 2008. she's she's
 
04:55:51.350 --> 04:55:51.360 align:start position:0%
a exceptional person
 
04:55:51.360 --> 04:55:52.230 align:start position:0%
a exceptional person
and

04:55:52.230 --> 04:55:52.240 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:55:54.470 --> 04:55:54.480 align:start position:0%
kathy when she was taking her master's
 
04:55:54.480 --> 04:55:55.590 align:start position:0%
kathy when she was taking her master's
degree

04:55:55.590 --> 04:55:55.600 align:start position:0%
degree
 
04:55:58.070 --> 04:55:58.080 align:start position:0%
did a little uh study at bradford
 
04:56:00.948 --> 04:56:00.958 align:start position:0%
elementary school with the fifth grade
 
04:56:00.958 --> 04:56:01.830 align:start position:0%
elementary school with the fifth grade
um

04:56:01.830 --> 04:56:01.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:56:04.868 --> 04:56:04.878 align:start position:0%
she's always been a person and i think
 
04:56:07.110 --> 04:56:07.120 align:start position:0%
trained physical education people are
 
04:56:10.310 --> 04:56:10.320 align:start position:0%
trained to incorporate curriculum in
 
04:56:11.750 --> 04:56:11.760 align:start position:0%
their curriculum
 
04:56:14.470 --> 04:56:14.480 align:start position:0%
academics there's always it's not just
 
04:56:16.470 --> 04:56:16.480 align:start position:0%
here's the ball go and have a good time
 
04:56:17.510 --> 04:56:17.520 align:start position:0%
with it
 
04:56:19.910 --> 04:56:19.920 align:start position:0%
we do a lot with safety we do a lot with
 
04:56:22.708 --> 04:56:22.718 align:start position:0%
fitness we do a lot with
 
04:56:25.030 --> 04:56:25.040 align:start position:0%
coordinating things with academics and
 
04:56:27.430 --> 04:56:27.440 align:start position:0%
kathy did this study with math and you
 
04:56:28.708 --> 04:56:28.718 align:start position:0%
know sitting on this committee i've
 
04:56:29.910 --> 04:56:29.920 align:start position:0%
heard about
 
04:56:32.070 --> 04:56:32.080 align:start position:0%
poor math scores and the reading scores
 
04:56:34.230 --> 04:56:34.240 align:start position:0%
at grade level three
 
04:56:36.788 --> 04:56:36.798 align:start position:0%
and so she attacked it by
 
04:56:39.030 --> 04:56:39.040 align:start position:0%
having a controlled group and a
 
04:56:41.990 --> 04:56:42.000 align:start position:0%
a group that didn't do anything except
 
04:56:43.430 --> 04:56:43.440 align:start position:0%
go to math class
 
04:56:45.670 --> 04:56:45.680 align:start position:0%
and then the other group she worked with
 
04:56:47.830 --> 04:56:47.840 align:start position:0%
where she paired math
 
04:56:51.030 --> 04:56:51.040 align:start position:0%
questions and math skills with what was
 
04:56:53.430 --> 04:56:53.440 align:start position:0%
happening in physical education
 
04:56:56.230 --> 04:56:56.240 align:start position:0%
and at the end of her period of time she
 
04:56:58.550 --> 04:56:58.560 align:start position:0%
found out that they then tested them on
 
04:57:00.868 --> 04:57:00.878 align:start position:0%
the normal tests and
 
04:57:03.030 --> 04:57:03.040 align:start position:0%
the group that she worked with came out
 
04:57:03.040 --> 04:57:04.390 align:start position:0%
the group that she worked with came out
statistically

04:57:04.390 --> 04:57:04.400 align:start position:0%
statistically
 
04:57:06.470 --> 04:57:06.480 align:start position:0%
higher in math than the group that
 
04:57:09.350 --> 04:57:09.360 align:start position:0%
didn't and in fact she said one of the
 
04:57:12.150 --> 04:57:12.160 align:start position:0%
like aha moments the eisen einstein
 
04:57:14.470 --> 04:57:14.480 align:start position:0%
moment was when this kid said
 
04:57:16.390 --> 04:57:16.400 align:start position:0%
i finally figured out what perimeter
 
04:57:16.400 --> 04:57:17.430 align:start position:0%
i finally figured out what perimeter
means

04:57:17.430 --> 04:57:17.440 align:start position:0%
means
 
04:57:21.190 --> 04:57:21.200 align:start position:0%
okay so uh kathy kathy did a lot of work
 
04:57:21.200 --> 04:57:21.990 align:start position:0%
okay so uh kathy kathy did a lot of work
and

04:57:21.990 --> 04:57:22.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:57:24.708 --> 04:57:24.718 align:start position:0%
she wants you to know that um
 
04:57:26.868 --> 04:57:26.878 align:start position:0%
and i want you to know as well
 
04:57:29.110 --> 04:57:29.120 align:start position:0%
that physical education is critically
 
04:57:31.270 --> 04:57:31.280 align:start position:0%
important physical activity is pretty
 
04:57:33.350 --> 04:57:33.360 align:start position:0%
critically important in the development
 
04:57:34.470 --> 04:57:34.480 align:start position:0%
of children
 
04:57:36.628 --> 04:57:36.638 align:start position:0%
play is how kids learn
 
04:57:38.150 --> 04:57:38.160 align:start position:0%
and recess
 
04:57:40.628 --> 04:57:40.638 align:start position:0%
an unorganized play is great but it
 
04:57:40.638 --> 04:57:41.590 align:start position:0%
an unorganized play is great but it
isn't

04:57:41.590 --> 04:57:41.600 align:start position:0%
isn't
 
04:57:44.788 --> 04:57:44.798 align:start position:0%
it needs to be at some level organized
 
04:57:46.868 --> 04:57:46.878 align:start position:0%
and it should be under the tutelage of a
 
04:57:48.948 --> 04:57:48.958 align:start position:0%
teacher who's been trained in physical
 
04:57:48.958 --> 04:57:50.390 align:start position:0%
teacher who's been trained in physical
education

04:57:50.390 --> 04:57:50.400 align:start position:0%
education
 
04:57:50.400 --> 04:57:52.390 align:start position:0%
education
and

04:57:52.390 --> 04:57:52.400 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:57:52.400 --> 04:57:53.190 align:start position:0%
and
so

04:57:53.190 --> 04:57:53.200 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:57:56.230 --> 04:57:56.240 align:start position:0%
i knew from college that
 
04:57:57.750 --> 04:57:57.760 align:start position:0%
different studies have proven right
 
04:57:57.760 --> 04:57:58.788 align:start position:0%
different studies have proven right
along

04:57:58.788 --> 04:57:58.798 align:start position:0%
along
 
04:58:01.350 --> 04:58:01.360 align:start position:0%
that reading is really can be improved
 
04:58:03.830 --> 04:58:03.840 align:start position:0%
tremendously through physical activity
 
04:58:06.708 --> 04:58:06.718 align:start position:0%
so i taught at the high school and
 
04:58:08.948 --> 04:58:08.958 align:start position:0%
one of the things at the high school we
 
04:58:11.110 --> 04:58:11.120 align:start position:0%
had a required course
 
04:58:14.550 --> 04:58:14.560 align:start position:0%
in it was called fit for life and it was
 
04:58:16.230 --> 04:58:16.240 align:start position:0%
really important
 
04:58:17.430 --> 04:58:17.440 align:start position:0%
i think
 
04:58:19.510 --> 04:58:19.520 align:start position:0%
and i've had some
 
04:58:22.070 --> 04:58:22.080 align:start position:0%
some feedback from former graduates how
 
04:58:24.628 --> 04:58:24.638 align:start position:0%
important it was in their life
 
04:58:26.708 --> 04:58:26.718 align:start position:0%
that we studied um
 
04:58:29.350 --> 04:58:29.360 align:start position:0%
and we did you know weight training we
 
04:58:32.550 --> 04:58:32.560 align:start position:0%
did uh stretching we did yoga we exposed
 
04:58:34.550 --> 04:58:34.560 align:start position:0%
them to a lot of different activities
 
04:58:36.230 --> 04:58:36.240 align:start position:0%
but as we were doing them we were
 
04:58:38.230 --> 04:58:38.240 align:start position:0%
talking to them about how
 
04:58:39.990 --> 04:58:40.000 align:start position:0%
it improved their immune system which
 
04:58:42.390 --> 04:58:42.400 align:start position:0%
somebody was here talking about before
 
04:58:44.868 --> 04:58:44.878 align:start position:0%
we we hit nutrition
 
04:58:46.708 --> 04:58:46.718 align:start position:0%
we hit a lot of different areas and it
 
04:58:49.110 --> 04:58:49.120 align:start position:0%
was a course that i feel i was very
 
04:58:51.590 --> 04:58:51.600 align:start position:0%
proud of that we had that and then on
 
04:58:53.350 --> 04:58:53.360 align:start position:0%
the other hand
 
04:58:55.670 --> 04:58:55.680 align:start position:0%
for the rest of their credit they took a
 
04:58:57.590 --> 04:58:57.600 align:start position:0%
an elective
 
04:58:59.350 --> 04:58:59.360 align:start position:0%
either in an individual sport or they
 
04:59:01.990 --> 04:59:02.000 align:start position:0%
could take a team sport but we tried to
 
04:59:03.990 --> 04:59:04.000 align:start position:0%
really push the individual lifetime
 
04:59:07.510 --> 04:59:07.520 align:start position:0%
sports because as dr konerk said
 
04:59:09.590 --> 04:59:09.600 align:start position:0%
you know a lot of people aren't into
 
04:59:12.150 --> 04:59:12.160 align:start position:0%
basketball and football
 
04:59:14.230 --> 04:59:14.240 align:start position:0%
and the team sports although i think
 
04:59:15.910 --> 04:59:15.920 align:start position:0%
they're really important for a lot of
 
04:59:18.470 --> 04:59:18.480 align:start position:0%
kids as far as building team and being
 
04:59:20.070 --> 04:59:20.080 align:start position:0%
able to work with other people there's
 
04:59:22.230 --> 04:59:22.240 align:start position:0%
advantages to team sports
 
04:59:24.868 --> 04:59:24.878 align:start position:0%
but once you get in your 20s and 30s and
 
04:59:27.270 --> 04:59:27.280 align:start position:0%
40s and 50s and like i am
 
04:59:29.510 --> 04:59:29.520 align:start position:0%
way up above that you know i'm still
 
04:59:32.948 --> 04:59:32.958 align:start position:0%
playing tennis and um i'm not a serena
 
04:59:35.910 --> 04:59:35.920 align:start position:0%
williams by any means but i play tennis
 
04:59:38.628 --> 04:59:38.638 align:start position:0%
and um it's really important to be
 
04:59:38.638 --> 04:59:39.670 align:start position:0%
and um it's really important to be
active

04:59:39.670 --> 04:59:39.680 align:start position:0%
active
 
04:59:42.708 --> 04:59:42.718 align:start position:0%
and it gives you a longer lifetime
 
04:59:44.628 --> 04:59:44.638 align:start position:0%
so i think this is this is a really
 
04:59:47.350 --> 04:59:47.360 align:start position:0%
important bill i'd also like to remind
 
04:59:49.030 --> 04:59:49.040 align:start position:0%
people on this committee that have been
 
04:59:51.030 --> 04:59:51.040 align:start position:0%
on the committee for a while that a few
 
04:59:53.830 --> 04:59:53.840 align:start position:0%
years ago the honorable mary guy myself
 
04:59:56.310 --> 04:59:56.320 align:start position:0%
and a representative from manchester
 
04:59:58.628 --> 04:59:58.638 align:start position:0%
got a bill through to change primary
 
05:00:00.868 --> 05:00:00.878 align:start position:0%
school or to encourage
 
05:00:03.110 --> 05:00:03.120 align:start position:0%
require primary schools
 
05:00:05.670 --> 05:00:05.680 align:start position:0%
and preschools to do experiential
 
05:00:08.708 --> 05:00:08.718 align:start position:0%
learning to do physical learning
 
05:00:11.110 --> 05:00:11.120 align:start position:0%
so that the students had play that was
 
05:00:13.590 --> 05:00:13.600 align:start position:0%
actually directed by somebody who knew
 
05:00:14.868 --> 05:00:14.878 align:start position:0%
what they were doing they were a trained
 
05:00:18.310 --> 05:00:18.320 align:start position:0%
educator and that actually improved the
 
05:00:21.030 --> 05:00:21.040 align:start position:0%
fitness and coordination and
 
05:00:23.110 --> 05:00:23.120 align:start position:0%
and mental ability
 
05:00:24.708 --> 05:00:24.718 align:start position:0%
of the young children
 
05:00:26.390 --> 05:00:26.400 align:start position:0%
remember that children learn through
 
05:00:28.470 --> 05:00:28.480 align:start position:0%
play that's really important
 
05:00:29.910 --> 05:00:29.920 align:start position:0%
so um
 
05:00:32.150 --> 05:00:32.160 align:start position:0%
i'd also like to give a little shout out
 
05:00:33.990 --> 05:00:34.000 align:start position:0%
to my friend
 
05:00:36.708 --> 05:00:36.718 align:start position:0%
jerry frue mr frew who
 
05:00:39.030 --> 05:00:39.040 align:start position:0%
was a student teacher when i started at
 
05:00:39.040 --> 05:00:40.150 align:start position:0%
was a student teacher when i started at
kearsarge

05:00:40.150 --> 05:00:40.160 align:start position:0%
kearsarge
 
05:00:41.590 --> 05:00:41.600 align:start position:0%
and um
 
05:00:43.750 --> 05:00:43.760 align:start position:0%
then he became prince felts and came
 
05:00:45.910 --> 05:00:45.920 align:start position:0%
back as our superintendent
 
05:00:48.628 --> 05:00:48.638 align:start position:0%
and then moved on to bigger and brighter
 
05:00:48.638 --> 05:00:49.670 align:start position:0%
and then moved on to bigger and brighter
things

05:00:49.670 --> 05:00:49.680 align:start position:0%
things
 
05:00:51.990 --> 05:00:52.000 align:start position:0%
so jerry's been through my uh throughout
 
05:00:54.390 --> 05:00:54.400 align:start position:0%
my career and i think what he said was
 
05:00:55.910 --> 05:00:55.920 align:start position:0%
really important it's kind of like the
 
05:00:55.920 --> 05:00:57.350 align:start position:0%
really important it's kind of like the
maslow's

05:00:57.350 --> 05:00:57.360 align:start position:0%
maslow's
 
05:01:00.230 --> 05:01:00.240 align:start position:0%
hierarchy of needs you know you can't
 
05:01:03.990 --> 05:01:04.000 align:start position:0%
get to philosophy you can't get to
 
05:01:06.550 --> 05:01:06.560 align:start position:0%
the peak of things
 
05:01:08.628 --> 05:01:08.638 align:start position:0%
unless the your basic needs are being
 
05:01:11.830 --> 05:01:11.840 align:start position:0%
satisfied and in schools right now in
 
05:01:14.150 --> 05:01:14.160 align:start position:0%
community public schools
 
05:01:15.750 --> 05:01:15.760 align:start position:0%
over regulation
 
05:01:15.760 --> 05:01:17.110 align:start position:0%
over regulation
underfunding

05:01:17.110 --> 05:01:17.120 align:start position:0%
underfunding
 
05:01:19.030 --> 05:01:19.040 align:start position:0%
throw on that a little coveted
 
05:01:20.470 --> 05:01:20.480 align:start position:0%
throw on that
 
05:01:23.030 --> 05:01:23.040 align:start position:0%
extended learning opportunities that are
 
05:01:23.040 --> 05:01:24.070 align:start position:0%
extended learning opportunities that are
not

05:01:24.070 --> 05:01:24.080 align:start position:0%
not
 
05:01:26.070 --> 05:01:26.080 align:start position:0%
well coordinated or assessed or
 
05:01:28.470 --> 05:01:28.480 align:start position:0%
accountable and i think
 
05:01:31.110 --> 05:01:31.120 align:start position:0%
the people in the public school systems
 
05:01:34.070 --> 05:01:34.080 align:start position:0%
know that they're at the basic level so
 
05:01:36.550 --> 05:01:36.560 align:start position:0%
i know this is a leap of faith for them
 
05:01:38.628 --> 05:01:38.638 align:start position:0%
but i think it's good to get it out and
 
05:01:40.470 --> 05:01:40.480 align:start position:0%
say that yes
 
05:01:42.470 --> 05:01:42.480 align:start position:0%
and i'm sure mr o'neill is going dr
 
05:01:44.868 --> 05:01:44.878 align:start position:0%
o'neill will follow this up
 
05:01:47.830 --> 05:01:47.840 align:start position:0%
that fitness and physical activity are
 
05:01:50.310 --> 05:01:50.320 align:start position:0%
really really important and sometimes we
 
05:01:52.868 --> 05:01:52.878 align:start position:0%
don't realize that until we're too old
 
05:01:54.390 --> 05:01:54.400 align:start position:0%
and by then
 
05:01:57.910 --> 05:01:57.920 align:start position:0%
um you know we work at it but
 
05:01:59.670 --> 05:01:59.680 align:start position:0%
it isn't the benefit that we could have
 
05:02:02.070 --> 05:02:02.080 align:start position:0%
had if we started at a younger age and
 
05:02:03.590 --> 05:02:03.600 align:start position:0%
i'm open for any questions that you
 
05:02:05.110 --> 05:02:05.120 align:start position:0%
might have thank you very much
 
05:02:07.030 --> 05:02:07.040 align:start position:0%
representative represent hobson you have
 
05:02:08.868 --> 05:02:08.878 align:start position:0%
a question
 
05:02:11.510 --> 05:02:11.520 align:start position:0%
yes thank you for taking my question and
 
05:02:14.150 --> 05:02:14.160 align:start position:0%
thank you for testifying today can you
 
05:02:16.550 --> 05:02:16.560 align:start position:0%
tell me how many hours of physical
 
05:02:18.948 --> 05:02:18.958 align:start position:0%
education the kids are getting right now
 
05:02:20.948 --> 05:02:20.958 align:start position:0%
in this bill you reference
 
05:02:24.788 --> 05:02:24.798 align:start position:0%
150 minutes per week yeah i think
 
05:02:26.150 --> 05:02:26.160 align:start position:0%
at the high school level they they're
 
05:02:27.910 --> 05:02:27.920 align:start position:0%
required to get one credit of physical
 
05:02:27.920 --> 05:02:29.030 align:start position:0%
required to get one credit of physical
education

05:02:29.030 --> 05:02:29.040 align:start position:0%
education
 
05:02:31.270 --> 05:02:31.280 align:start position:0%
which basically is um
 
05:02:32.470 --> 05:02:32.480 align:start position:0%
a year
 
05:02:35.510 --> 05:02:35.520 align:start position:0%
of um courses so over over the four
 
05:02:37.830 --> 05:02:37.840 align:start position:0%
years it's it's one credit in the
 
05:02:39.830 --> 05:02:39.840 align:start position:0%
elementary school most elementary
 
05:02:39.840 --> 05:02:41.110 align:start position:0%
elementary school most elementary
schools

05:02:41.110 --> 05:02:41.120 align:start position:0%
schools
 
05:02:42.868 --> 05:02:42.878 align:start position:0%
get physical education i believe in our
 
05:02:46.628 --> 05:02:46.638 align:start position:0%
school district it was one period a week
 
05:02:49.190 --> 05:02:49.200 align:start position:0%
and it was set up so that
 
05:02:51.110 --> 05:02:51.120 align:start position:0%
the same period would then rotate the
 
05:02:53.430 --> 05:02:53.440 align:start position:0%
next day to art the next day to music
 
05:02:55.750 --> 05:02:55.760 align:start position:0%
you know and so on so that the the
 
05:02:58.470 --> 05:02:58.480 align:start position:0%
students had that particular block
 
05:03:00.230 --> 05:03:00.240 align:start position:0%
blocked out but they only had physical
 
05:03:02.070 --> 05:03:02.080 align:start position:0%
education once a week so
 
05:03:05.030 --> 05:03:05.040 align:start position:0%
if that day was a monday and think of
 
05:03:07.270 --> 05:03:07.280 align:start position:0%
the holidays that we've had on mondays a
 
05:03:09.750 --> 05:03:09.760 align:start position:0%
lot of times they'd go two weeks without
 
05:03:12.310 --> 05:03:12.320 align:start position:0%
any physical education and at that age
 
05:03:13.270 --> 05:03:13.280 align:start position:0%
they really
 
05:03:15.830 --> 05:03:15.840 align:start position:0%
really it's important
 
05:03:15.840 --> 05:03:16.868 align:start position:0%
really it's important
follow-up

05:03:16.868 --> 05:03:16.878 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
05:03:18.788 --> 05:03:18.798 align:start position:0%
representative moffett thank you mr
 
05:03:20.470 --> 05:03:20.480 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking my
 
05:03:22.150 --> 05:03:22.160 align:start position:0%
question uh speaking of mr fruit when i
 
05:03:23.430 --> 05:03:23.440 align:start position:0%
drove in here my
 
05:03:25.670 --> 05:03:25.680 align:start position:0%
my light came on for low gas and so that
 
05:03:28.150 --> 05:03:28.160 align:start position:0%
imagery keeps sticking in my mind but
 
05:03:30.550 --> 05:03:30.560 align:start position:0%
your point about that i think
 
05:03:32.150 --> 05:03:32.160 align:start position:0%
is is well taken
 
05:03:32.160 --> 05:03:33.190 align:start position:0%
is is well taken
uh

05:03:33.190 --> 05:03:33.200 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:03:35.190 --> 05:03:35.200 align:start position:0%
it says this act will take effect 60
 
05:03:37.670 --> 05:03:37.680 align:start position:0%
days after passage it's not my question
 
05:03:39.270 --> 05:03:39.280 align:start position:0%
because i have one question and i want
 
05:03:40.550 --> 05:03:40.560 align:start position:0%
to get right to it maybe somebody else
 
05:03:42.948 --> 05:03:42.958 align:start position:0%
can ask about that
 
05:03:45.350 --> 05:03:45.360 align:start position:0%
60-day piece my question
 
05:03:46.948 --> 05:03:46.958 align:start position:0%
uh has to do with the asset the new
 
05:03:48.230 --> 05:03:48.240 align:start position:0%
england association of schools and
 
05:03:50.628 --> 05:03:50.638 align:start position:0%
colleges that does accreditation
 
05:03:53.110 --> 05:03:53.120 align:start position:0%
for schools and colleges and uh do you
 
05:03:55.910 --> 05:03:55.920 align:start position:0%
know i i do not but does the asic have
 
05:03:58.868 --> 05:03:58.878 align:start position:0%
some current uh when they credit schools
 
05:04:00.868 --> 05:04:00.878 align:start position:0%
do they have some current standard for
 
05:04:00.878 --> 05:04:01.990 align:start position:0%
do they have some current standard for
pe

05:04:01.990 --> 05:04:02.000 align:start position:0%
pe
 
05:04:05.830 --> 05:04:05.840 align:start position:0%
um i haven't taught since 2004. um but
 
05:04:07.990 --> 05:04:08.000 align:start position:0%
before that i was involved in several
 
05:04:10.868 --> 05:04:10.878 align:start position:0%
accreditation programs and at that time
 
05:04:12.470 --> 05:04:12.480 align:start position:0%
they did have physical education
 
05:04:14.708 --> 05:04:14.718 align:start position:0%
standards i'm not sure what they have at
 
05:04:17.270 --> 05:04:17.280 align:start position:0%
this at this very point but i know that
 
05:04:18.868 --> 05:04:18.878 align:start position:0%
that was one of the things on
 
05:04:21.270 --> 05:04:21.280 align:start position:0%
accrediting high schools
 
05:04:23.430 --> 05:04:23.440 align:start position:0%
and as far as the 60 day notices i think
 
05:04:24.788 --> 05:04:24.798 align:start position:0%
that is
 
05:04:26.628 --> 05:04:26.638 align:start position:0%
kind of absurd
 
05:04:29.110 --> 05:04:29.120 align:start position:0%
that schools you know we don't realize
 
05:04:32.310 --> 05:04:32.320 align:start position:0%
that schools go from september to june
 
05:04:34.070 --> 05:04:34.080 align:start position:0%
and everybody else is in the mindset
 
05:04:36.390 --> 05:04:36.400 align:start position:0%
with budget and everything from january
 
05:04:38.150 --> 05:04:38.160 align:start position:0%
to january you know just like our
 
05:04:41.110 --> 05:04:41.120 align:start position:0%
session and so you know you're always in
 
05:04:43.270 --> 05:04:43.280 align:start position:0%
a school situation you're always
 
05:04:43.280 --> 05:04:44.390 align:start position:0%
a school situation you're always
thinking

05:04:44.390 --> 05:04:44.400 align:start position:0%
thinking
 
05:04:47.030 --> 05:04:47.040 align:start position:0%
um almost the full year ahead in order
 
05:04:48.628 --> 05:04:48.638 align:start position:0%
to prepare for your courses your
 
05:04:51.510 --> 05:04:51.520 align:start position:0%
curriculum and your budget and
 
05:04:53.350 --> 05:04:53.360 align:start position:0%
even though you didn't ask but
 
05:04:55.430 --> 05:04:55.440 align:start position:0%
just having you ask a question
 
05:04:57.670 --> 05:04:57.680 align:start position:0%
reminded me about the sports
 
05:05:01.190 --> 05:05:01.200 align:start position:0%
uh the participation in sports that um
 
05:05:03.510 --> 05:05:03.520 align:start position:0%
representative baum talked about
 
05:05:03.520 --> 05:05:04.788 align:start position:0%
representative baum talked about
uh

05:05:04.788 --> 05:05:04.798 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:05:06.788 --> 05:05:06.798 align:start position:0%
so the granddaughter is in gymnastics
 
05:05:08.470 --> 05:05:08.480 align:start position:0%
and she's she's
 
05:05:11.030 --> 05:05:11.040 align:start position:0%
act active and she's probably very
 
05:05:12.310 --> 05:05:12.320 align:start position:0%
muscular but
 
05:05:16.628 --> 05:05:16.638 align:start position:0%
um she hasn't had the ability to see
 
05:05:18.470 --> 05:05:18.480 align:start position:0%
how that connects with fitness and talk
 
05:05:21.030 --> 05:05:21.040 align:start position:0%
about nutrition and talk about
 
05:05:23.030 --> 05:05:23.040 align:start position:0%
proper stretching and that sort of thing
 
05:05:23.040 --> 05:05:23.750 align:start position:0%
proper stretching and that sort of thing
and

05:05:23.750 --> 05:05:23.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:05:26.070 --> 05:05:26.080 align:start position:0%
whatever participation kids have in high
 
05:05:29.750 --> 05:05:29.760 align:start position:0%
school sports it varies so greatly
 
05:05:31.750 --> 05:05:31.760 align:start position:0%
the first year our school the last year
 
05:05:33.590 --> 05:05:33.600 align:start position:0%
i taught actually was the first year
 
05:05:35.270 --> 05:05:35.280 align:start position:0%
they decided they'd give a credit for
 
05:05:38.230 --> 05:05:38.240 align:start position:0%
phys ed for going out for a sport
 
05:05:41.030 --> 05:05:41.040 align:start position:0%
and i was the tennis coach
 
05:05:42.628 --> 05:05:42.638 align:start position:0%
we have three courts
 
05:05:45.110 --> 05:05:45.120 align:start position:0%
okay um and we share them with the boys
 
05:05:45.120 --> 05:05:46.070 align:start position:0%
okay um and we share them with the boys
team

05:05:46.070 --> 05:05:46.080 align:start position:0%
team
 
05:05:48.230 --> 05:05:48.240 align:start position:0%
and all of a sudden normally i would
 
05:05:50.470 --> 05:05:50.480 align:start position:0%
have 15 to 20 girls come out for visit
 
05:05:51.910 --> 05:05:51.920 align:start position:0%
for tennis
 
05:05:53.510 --> 05:05:53.520 align:start position:0%
um and at least
 
05:05:56.230 --> 05:05:56.240 align:start position:0%
i would say 19 out of 20 knew how to
 
05:05:57.510 --> 05:05:57.520 align:start position:0%
play tennis
 
05:06:00.470 --> 05:06:00.480 align:start position:0%
that year i had 40 girls try out for
 
05:06:00.480 --> 05:06:01.670 align:start position:0%
that year i had 40 girls try out for
tennis

05:06:01.670 --> 05:06:01.680 align:start position:0%
tennis
 
05:06:01.680 --> 05:06:02.788 align:start position:0%
tennis
and

05:06:02.788 --> 05:06:02.798 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:06:05.030 --> 05:06:05.040 align:start position:0%
there was a no cut policy
 
05:06:06.230 --> 05:06:06.240 align:start position:0%
put in
 
05:06:08.470 --> 05:06:08.480 align:start position:0%
and i would say at least half of them
 
05:06:10.070 --> 05:06:10.080 align:start position:0%
had never picked up a tennis racket the
 
05:06:11.430 --> 05:06:11.440 align:start position:0%
only reason they were doing it was to
 
05:06:13.830 --> 05:06:13.840 align:start position:0%
get a physical education credit
 
05:06:13.840 --> 05:06:14.628 align:start position:0%
get a physical education credit
so

05:06:14.628 --> 05:06:14.638 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:06:16.628 --> 05:06:16.638 align:start position:0%
there's no way that i would i would
 
05:06:18.550 --> 05:06:18.560 align:start position:0%
support that
 
05:06:20.788 --> 05:06:20.798 align:start position:0%
thank you representative porter
 
05:06:22.150 --> 05:06:22.160 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you
 
05:06:23.910 --> 05:06:23.920 align:start position:0%
representative tanner
 
05:06:25.750 --> 05:06:25.760 align:start position:0%
i'm thinking about
 
05:06:27.430 --> 05:06:27.440 align:start position:0%
the other testimony we heard and also
 
05:06:29.110 --> 05:06:29.120 align:start position:0%
the reality of an elementary school
 
05:06:29.120 --> 05:06:30.708 align:start position:0%
the reality of an elementary school
teacher

05:06:30.708 --> 05:06:30.718 align:start position:0%
teacher
 
05:06:30.718 --> 05:06:32.550 align:start position:0%
teacher
perspective

05:06:32.550 --> 05:06:32.560 align:start position:0%
perspective
 
05:06:35.030 --> 05:06:35.040 align:start position:0%
you are right usually it's a 45 minute
 
05:06:36.948 --> 05:06:36.958 align:start position:0%
period once a week that elementary
 
05:06:39.350 --> 05:06:39.360 align:start position:0%
students would get physical education
 
05:06:42.230 --> 05:06:42.240 align:start position:0%
this bill requires four times that which
 
05:06:44.708 --> 05:06:44.718 align:start position:0%
means four days a week of
 
05:06:46.708 --> 05:06:46.718 align:start position:0%
of 45 minutes
 
05:06:48.550 --> 05:06:48.560 align:start position:0%
i don't know how
 
05:06:50.150 --> 05:06:50.160 align:start position:0%
that could happen
 
05:06:53.430 --> 05:06:53.440 align:start position:0%
with one physical education teacher
 
05:06:54.788 --> 05:06:54.798 align:start position:0%
where how did you come up with that
 
05:06:56.788 --> 05:06:56.798 align:start position:0%
figure because it just is as much as
 
05:06:59.270 --> 05:06:59.280 align:start position:0%
it's a good idea it just isn't feasible
 
05:07:01.030 --> 05:07:01.040 align:start position:0%
i would think i think dr o'neill
 
05:07:02.948 --> 05:07:02.958 align:start position:0%
probably addressed that because i think
 
05:07:04.948 --> 05:07:04.958 align:start position:0%
that's a figure that comes from a
 
05:07:07.590 --> 05:07:07.600 align:start position:0%
national point of view
 
05:07:09.270 --> 05:07:09.280 align:start position:0%
one of the things that can be done and
 
05:07:10.470 --> 05:07:10.480 align:start position:0%
should be done
 
05:07:12.310 --> 05:07:12.320 align:start position:0%
and i'm not sure if you can even
 
05:07:13.910 --> 05:07:13.920 align:start position:0%
legislate it but
 
05:07:16.550 --> 05:07:16.560 align:start position:0%
for example kathy worked a lot with her
 
05:07:18.628 --> 05:07:18.638 align:start position:0%
other colleagues or other elementary
 
05:07:20.390 --> 05:07:20.400 align:start position:0%
school teachers
 
05:07:22.948 --> 05:07:22.958 align:start position:0%
and gave them ideas about how they could
 
05:07:25.270 --> 05:07:25.280 align:start position:0%
incorporate physical movement
 
05:07:28.070 --> 05:07:28.080 align:start position:0%
and physical skills with math with
 
05:07:30.788 --> 05:07:30.798 align:start position:0%
reading uh social studies they did you
 
05:07:33.430 --> 05:07:33.440 align:start position:0%
know like where's waldo across the world
 
05:07:33.440 --> 05:07:34.470 align:start position:0%
know like where's waldo across the world
and and

05:07:34.470 --> 05:07:34.480 align:start position:0%
and and
 
05:07:37.590 --> 05:07:37.600 align:start position:0%
the kids charted you know their walking
 
05:07:40.470 --> 05:07:40.480 align:start position:0%
um distances and things like that so i
 
05:07:42.150 --> 05:07:42.160 align:start position:0%
think it's something that
 
05:07:44.708 --> 05:07:44.718 align:start position:0%
uh if you had a physical educator within
 
05:07:46.550 --> 05:07:46.560 align:start position:0%
the district
 
05:07:49.190 --> 05:07:49.200 align:start position:0%
uh that actually did the one period a
 
05:07:50.390 --> 05:07:50.400 align:start position:0%
week but then
 
05:07:52.390 --> 05:07:52.400 align:start position:0%
trained the other people within the
 
05:07:55.030 --> 05:07:55.040 align:start position:0%
school system that you could come close
 
05:07:55.990 --> 05:07:56.000 align:start position:0%
to it
 
05:07:58.550 --> 05:07:58.560 align:start position:0%
i i this is the ideal it really is the
 
05:08:01.110 --> 05:08:01.120 align:start position:0%
ideal and you can imagine how great kids
 
05:08:03.270 --> 05:08:03.280 align:start position:0%
would be i know just teaching at high
 
05:08:05.430 --> 05:08:05.440 align:start position:0%
school i had kids take extra phys ed or
 
05:08:07.830 --> 05:08:07.840 align:start position:0%
they would come down to the gym or i had
 
05:08:10.628 --> 05:08:10.638 align:start position:0%
this one boy that by the last period of
 
05:08:12.310 --> 05:08:12.320 align:start position:0%
the day i knew he'd be there and i'd
 
05:08:14.230 --> 05:08:14.240 align:start position:0%
hear the doors open and he'd
 
05:08:16.230 --> 05:08:16.240 align:start position:0%
run across the gym and he'd pick up any
 
05:08:17.830 --> 05:08:17.840 align:start position:0%
ball that was on the floor or anything
 
05:08:19.830 --> 05:08:19.840 align:start position:0%
and start running around dribbling it
 
05:08:21.030 --> 05:08:21.040 align:start position:0%
and everything and then he come to me
 
05:08:22.550 --> 05:08:22.560 align:start position:0%
and he'd say
 
05:08:24.390 --> 05:08:24.400 align:start position:0%
thanks and then he'd walk back to his
 
05:08:24.400 --> 05:08:26.070 align:start position:0%
thanks and then he'd walk back to his
class

05:08:26.070 --> 05:08:26.080 align:start position:0%
class
 
05:08:28.070 --> 05:08:28.080 align:start position:0%
so represent tanner i have a question
 
05:08:31.030 --> 05:08:31.040 align:start position:0%
for you sure and and looking back and
 
05:08:32.708 --> 05:08:32.718 align:start position:0%
tapping some of your historical
 
05:08:35.110 --> 05:08:35.120 align:start position:0%
understanding of physical education
 
05:08:37.830 --> 05:08:37.840 align:start position:0%
um i'm married to a physical education i
 
05:08:40.470 --> 05:08:40.480 align:start position:0%
thought it's kinesiology and so is uh
 
05:08:42.470 --> 05:08:42.480 align:start position:0%
representative woodcock i believe is too
 
05:08:44.470 --> 05:08:44.480 align:start position:0%
a number of folks here have it in the
 
05:08:44.480 --> 05:08:45.590 align:start position:0%
a number of folks here have it in the
family

05:08:45.590 --> 05:08:45.600 align:start position:0%
family
 
05:08:45.600 --> 05:08:46.470 align:start position:0%
family
um

05:08:46.470 --> 05:08:46.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:08:50.230 --> 05:08:50.240 align:start position:0%
i want to walk back to the 1970s
 
05:08:52.150 --> 05:08:52.160 align:start position:0%
i don't know if uh i was trying to go
 
05:08:54.150 --> 05:08:54.160 align:start position:0%
there i was teaching then i was teaching
 
05:08:58.070 --> 05:08:58.080 align:start position:0%
also and back in the 1970s we had within
 
05:09:00.550 --> 05:09:00.560 align:start position:0%
statute in maine and new hampshire
 
05:09:02.230 --> 05:09:02.240 align:start position:0%
there are guidelines set out that you
 
05:09:03.590 --> 05:09:03.600 align:start position:0%
had to teach so many minutes of
 
05:09:06.550 --> 05:09:06.560 align:start position:0%
everything each week yep
 
05:09:08.070 --> 05:09:08.080 align:start position:0%
that disappeared because we got into
 
05:09:10.150 --> 05:09:10.160 align:start position:0%
thematic teaching and integrating
 
05:09:12.550 --> 05:09:12.560 align:start position:0%
various subjects into you know together
 
05:09:14.788 --> 05:09:14.798 align:start position:0%
like you do in pe you might have square
 
05:09:17.110 --> 05:09:17.120 align:start position:0%
dance in a
 
05:09:20.230 --> 05:09:20.240 align:start position:0%
history class yeah um but the the
 
05:09:22.390 --> 05:09:22.400 align:start position:0%
question i have if we move back like
 
05:09:22.400 --> 05:09:23.670 align:start position:0%
question i have if we move back like
that

05:09:23.670 --> 05:09:23.680 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:09:27.430 --> 05:09:27.440 align:start position:0%
um i'm concerned i'm not concerned but a
 
05:09:29.830 --> 05:09:29.840 align:start position:0%
hurdle is that
 
05:09:29.840 --> 05:09:31.110 align:start position:0%
hurdle is that
pe

05:09:31.110 --> 05:09:31.120 align:start position:0%
pe
 
05:09:32.708 --> 05:09:32.718 align:start position:0%
in the elementary school and the
 
05:09:35.590 --> 05:09:35.600 align:start position:0%
elementary school in our state can be k
 
05:09:37.990 --> 05:09:38.000 align:start position:0%
through three grades four through six
 
05:09:40.230 --> 05:09:40.240 align:start position:0%
could be middle school k through eight
 
05:09:42.470 --> 05:09:42.480 align:start position:0%
could be elementary school
 
05:09:44.948 --> 05:09:44.958 align:start position:0%
so perhaps we gotta identify grade
 
05:09:46.550 --> 05:09:46.560 align:start position:0%
levels here
 
05:09:48.628 --> 05:09:48.638 align:start position:0%
but we're also tying in the negotiated
 
05:09:51.910 --> 05:09:51.920 align:start position:0%
agreements so many times pe music
 
05:09:54.788 --> 05:09:54.798 align:start position:0%
library are tied to preps
 
05:09:56.868 --> 05:09:56.878 align:start position:0%
prep for the teacher
 
05:09:59.270 --> 05:09:59.280 align:start position:0%
and that's so identified like that even
 
05:10:01.990 --> 05:10:02.000 align:start position:0%
in our funding law which we have
 
05:10:04.310 --> 05:10:04.320 align:start position:0%
developed back in 2008
 
05:10:04.320 --> 05:10:05.430 align:start position:0%
developed back in 2008
so

05:10:05.430 --> 05:10:05.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:10:07.190 --> 05:10:07.200 align:start position:0%
are we do we have those types of
 
05:10:08.868 --> 05:10:08.878 align:start position:0%
obstacles that we're going to have to
 
05:10:11.030 --> 05:10:11.040 align:start position:0%
deal with the negotiated agreement and
 
05:10:12.948 --> 05:10:12.958 align:start position:0%
which grade levels this is specifically
 
05:10:14.788 --> 05:10:14.798 align:start position:0%
talking about when we talk about 150
 
05:10:17.110 --> 05:10:17.120 align:start position:0%
minutes per elementary school we get 30
 
05:10:19.590 --> 05:10:19.600 align:start position:0%
minutes a day it could be 45 50 minutes
 
05:10:21.990 --> 05:10:22.000 align:start position:0%
a day depending upon when that traveling
 
05:10:24.470 --> 05:10:24.480 align:start position:0%
pe teacher is in your building right
 
05:10:26.390 --> 05:10:26.400 align:start position:0%
traveling and with all the equipment in
 
05:10:28.868 --> 05:10:28.878 align:start position:0%
the back of her car yes um
 
05:10:30.628 --> 05:10:30.638 align:start position:0%
yes uh that's that's quite true and
 
05:10:33.190 --> 05:10:33.200 align:start position:0%
that's uh one of the things i think as a
 
05:10:36.550 --> 05:10:36.560 align:start position:0%
as a former teacher and a realist and
 
05:10:38.628 --> 05:10:38.638 align:start position:0%
and also being on this committee
 
05:10:41.750 --> 05:10:41.760 align:start position:0%
um that yes there's things in this bill
 
05:10:43.830 --> 05:10:43.840 align:start position:0%
that need to be addressed
 
05:10:45.030 --> 05:10:45.040 align:start position:0%
um and
 
05:10:48.070 --> 05:10:48.080 align:start position:0%
like i believe um representative dushane
 
05:10:49.750 --> 05:10:49.760 align:start position:0%
said this morning you know part of it is
 
05:10:51.510 --> 05:10:51.520 align:start position:0%
setting guard rails and then
 
05:10:53.670 --> 05:10:53.680 align:start position:0%
letting the local area figure out what
 
05:10:55.590 --> 05:10:55.600 align:start position:0%
they can do within those guardrails but
 
05:10:57.990 --> 05:10:58.000 align:start position:0%
i think the main reason i'm testifying
 
05:11:00.868 --> 05:11:00.878 align:start position:0%
for this bill is that it's needed it
 
05:11:02.868 --> 05:11:02.878 align:start position:0%
needs to come to the forefront it's
 
05:11:05.030 --> 05:11:05.040 align:start position:0%
getting pressed obviously it's getting
 
05:11:07.910 --> 05:11:07.920 align:start position:0%
pressed here and uh i think it's uh
 
05:11:10.150 --> 05:11:10.160 align:start position:0%
important for everybody to realize
 
05:11:12.230 --> 05:11:12.240 align:start position:0%
during no child left behind i remember
 
05:11:14.390 --> 05:11:14.400 align:start position:0%
feeling left behind
 
05:11:16.550 --> 05:11:16.560 align:start position:0%
because i couldn't be a highly qualified
 
05:11:16.560 --> 05:11:18.070 align:start position:0%
because i couldn't be a highly qualified
teacher

05:11:18.070 --> 05:11:18.080 align:start position:0%
teacher
 
05:11:20.628 --> 05:11:20.638 align:start position:0%
and when i left teaching
 
05:11:22.150 --> 05:11:22.160 align:start position:0%
the person that they hired for my
 
05:11:24.150 --> 05:11:24.160 align:start position:0%
position wasn't a trained physical
 
05:11:25.830 --> 05:11:25.840 align:start position:0%
education teacher it was an athletic
 
05:11:28.390 --> 05:11:28.400 align:start position:0%
trainer that they thought could you know
 
05:11:29.750 --> 05:11:29.760 align:start position:0%
throw the ball out
 
05:11:31.590 --> 05:11:31.600 align:start position:0%
get get the kids moving around a little
 
05:11:34.150 --> 05:11:34.160 align:start position:0%
bit and be an athletic trainer for the
 
05:11:36.628 --> 05:11:36.638 align:start position:0%
sports teams and and she didn't last
 
05:11:37.670 --> 05:11:37.680 align:start position:0%
very long
 
05:11:37.680 --> 05:11:38.628 align:start position:0%
very long
um

05:11:38.628 --> 05:11:38.638 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:11:38.638 --> 05:11:39.590 align:start position:0%
um
and

05:11:39.590 --> 05:11:39.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:11:41.750 --> 05:11:41.760 align:start position:0%
part of my emphasis is that you need
 
05:11:43.590 --> 05:11:43.600 align:start position:0%
somebody who's trained a trained
 
05:11:45.670 --> 05:11:45.680 align:start position:0%
educator i know some people think that
 
05:11:47.350 --> 05:11:47.360 align:start position:0%
you know teaching is
 
05:11:50.070 --> 05:11:50.080 align:start position:0%
is not a big deal but it is it and it's
 
05:11:53.590 --> 05:11:53.600 align:start position:0%
it's really important in in all areas
 
05:11:56.070 --> 05:11:56.080 align:start position:0%
um in physical education it's very
 
05:11:57.670 --> 05:11:57.680 align:start position:0%
important thank you very much you're
 
05:12:00.310 --> 05:12:00.320 align:start position:0%
welcome yes represent woodcock thank you
 
05:12:00.320 --> 05:12:01.190 align:start position:0%
welcome yes represent woodcock thank you
chairman

05:12:01.190 --> 05:12:01.200 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
05:12:03.110 --> 05:12:03.120 align:start position:0%
president good afternoon
 
05:12:03.120 --> 05:12:04.390 align:start position:0%
president good afternoon
um

05:12:04.390 --> 05:12:04.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:12:06.150 --> 05:12:06.160 align:start position:0%
a couple questions and you're right my
 
05:12:07.590 --> 05:12:07.600 align:start position:0%
my wife is a physical education
 
05:12:08.708 --> 05:12:08.718 align:start position:0%
instructor for
 
05:12:11.670 --> 05:12:11.680 align:start position:0%
multiple three decades pluses and i was
 
05:12:13.110 --> 05:12:13.120 align:start position:0%
on my way up a department chair of
 
05:12:14.868 --> 05:12:14.878 align:start position:0%
health phys in high school
 
05:12:16.470 --> 05:12:16.480 align:start position:0%
um different schools
 
05:12:19.110 --> 05:12:19.120 align:start position:0%
i do have a question and i i was
 
05:12:21.030 --> 05:12:21.040 align:start position:0%
teaching not as early as representative
 
05:12:22.948 --> 05:12:22.958 align:start position:0%
labbitt in the same decade
 
05:12:25.110 --> 05:12:25.120 align:start position:0%
when there was the same
 
05:12:26.788 --> 05:12:26.798 align:start position:0%
same minute criteria for different
 
05:12:29.750 --> 05:12:29.760 align:start position:0%
subject matters and massachusetts at the
 
05:12:32.470 --> 05:12:32.480 align:start position:0%
time went to phys ed annually because as
 
05:12:34.470 --> 05:12:34.480 align:start position:0%
you know his budgets constrict
 
05:12:36.230 --> 05:12:36.240 align:start position:0%
first things that go out and use a phys
 
05:12:38.708 --> 05:12:38.718 align:start position:0%
ed then guidance right now in that in
 
05:12:41.670 --> 05:12:41.680 align:start position:0%
that order um so we're at the phys eddie
 
05:12:43.990 --> 05:12:44.000 align:start position:0%
so they went uh into phys that must be
 
05:12:46.070 --> 05:12:46.080 align:start position:0%
required annually
 
05:12:47.910 --> 05:12:47.920 align:start position:0%
and the annually was in high school they
 
05:12:49.350 --> 05:12:49.360 align:start position:0%
bring all the students in the gymnasium
 
05:12:51.830 --> 05:12:51.840 align:start position:0%
for one hour once a year to show a film
 
05:12:54.310 --> 05:12:54.320 align:start position:0%
to meet the criteria so i looked at the
 
05:12:56.150 --> 05:12:56.160 align:start position:0%
new hampshire regulations that on the
 
05:12:57.910 --> 05:12:57.920 align:start position:0%
bill that uh representative kenner put
 
05:13:00.948 --> 05:13:00.958 align:start position:0%
in on 161 263 i didn't see a financial
 
05:13:02.708 --> 05:13:02.718 align:start position:0%
note and i think there's a significant
 
05:13:05.190 --> 05:13:05.200 align:start position:0%
financial impact here uh and i support
 
05:13:06.948 --> 05:13:06.958 align:start position:0%
it i'm just telling you that these are
 
05:13:09.110 --> 05:13:09.120 align:start position:0%
my concerns the other one is its
 
05:13:10.470 --> 05:13:10.480 align:start position:0%
reference and i want you know this
 
05:13:11.590 --> 05:13:11.600 align:start position:0%
better than i because i don't know a
 
05:13:12.948 --> 05:13:12.958 align:start position:0%
whole lot about new hampshire physical
 
05:13:12.958 --> 05:13:14.110 align:start position:0%
whole lot about new hampshire physical
regulations

05:13:14.110 --> 05:13:14.120 align:start position:0%
regulations
 
05:13:17.190 --> 05:13:17.200 align:start position:0%
18910 as uh documented in the back part
 
05:13:18.708 --> 05:13:18.718 align:start position:0%
of the conirex bill that you
 
05:13:18.718 --> 05:13:20.390 align:start position:0%
of the conirex bill that you
co-sponsored

05:13:20.390 --> 05:13:20.400 align:start position:0%
co-sponsored
 
05:13:22.070 --> 05:13:22.080 align:start position:0%
identified that there is no requirement
 
05:13:23.350 --> 05:13:23.360 align:start position:0%
for physics
 
05:13:25.990 --> 05:13:26.000 align:start position:0%
and you look at the other two areas in
 
05:13:27.190 --> 05:13:27.200 align:start position:0%
the law of
 
05:13:29.670 --> 05:13:29.680 align:start position:0%
89 and 49 and then the other one says
 
05:13:31.990 --> 05:13:32.000 align:start position:0%
optional in the school board shall
 
05:13:34.310 --> 05:13:34.320 align:start position:0%
uh or may in this case
 
05:13:37.030 --> 05:13:37.040 align:start position:0%
so it's really almost a new requirement
 
05:13:39.990 --> 05:13:40.000 align:start position:0%
uh and we've been talking about that all
 
05:13:41.990 --> 05:13:42.000 align:start position:0%
all day and about requirements and as as
 
05:13:44.550 --> 05:13:44.560 align:start position:0%
the uh spokesperson for the secondary
 
05:13:46.230 --> 05:13:46.240 align:start position:0%
schools made it very very clear that
 
05:13:47.670 --> 05:13:47.680 align:start position:0%
there's just teachers at this point in
 
05:13:49.750 --> 05:13:49.760 align:start position:0%
schools that had enough and you and i
 
05:13:51.270 --> 05:13:51.280 align:start position:0%
you and i both know that
 
05:13:53.430 --> 05:13:53.440 align:start position:0%
at least i agree that all the courses
 
05:13:55.510 --> 05:13:55.520 align:start position:0%
should be local and not prescribed by
 
05:13:57.510 --> 05:13:57.520 align:start position:0%
some people in the concord
 
05:13:59.270 --> 05:13:59.280 align:start position:0%
that being said
 
05:14:00.708 --> 05:14:00.718 align:start position:0%
a course like this i do believe is
 
05:14:02.868 --> 05:14:02.878 align:start position:0%
valuable my question is how where are we
 
05:14:03.990 --> 05:14:04.000 align:start position:0%
going to get a
 
05:14:06.230 --> 05:14:06.240 align:start position:0%
funding be willing your staff and three
 
05:14:07.750 --> 05:14:07.760 align:start position:0%
more particularly where are we gonna get
 
05:14:09.430 --> 05:14:09.440 align:start position:0%
the time within the
 
05:14:11.190 --> 05:14:11.200 align:start position:0%
prescribed school day to fit it in and
 
05:14:12.948 --> 05:14:12.958 align:start position:0%
what goes out
 
05:14:15.430 --> 05:14:15.440 align:start position:0%
um right i guess it's it's priorities
 
05:14:17.190 --> 05:14:17.200 align:start position:0%
you know um
 
05:14:19.350 --> 05:14:19.360 align:start position:0%
the priorities for school and i i think
 
05:14:21.350 --> 05:14:21.360 align:start position:0%
one of the reasons that i wanted to
 
05:14:23.510 --> 05:14:23.520 align:start position:0%
testify on this is to say that physical
 
05:14:26.310 --> 05:14:26.320 align:start position:0%
education and activity and i'm sure dr
 
05:14:28.390 --> 05:14:28.400 align:start position:0%
o'neill is going to back this up
 
05:14:31.430 --> 05:14:31.440 align:start position:0%
it should and has to be a priority i
 
05:14:34.708 --> 05:14:34.718 align:start position:0%
mean it's it's something that
 
05:14:34.718 --> 05:14:35.750 align:start position:0%
mean it's it's something that
is

05:14:35.750 --> 05:14:35.760 align:start position:0%
is
 
05:14:37.590 --> 05:14:37.600 align:start position:0%
we can't take our children and put them
 
05:14:39.990 --> 05:14:40.000 align:start position:0%
in classes and give them workbooks and
 
05:14:42.550 --> 05:14:42.560 align:start position:0%
sit in front and and you know just
 
05:14:44.708 --> 05:14:44.718 align:start position:0%
lecture to them
 
05:14:47.270 --> 05:14:47.280 align:start position:0%
kids need to play kids needs to to learn
 
05:14:49.750 --> 05:14:49.760 align:start position:0%
fitness kids need to learn to activity
 
05:14:52.150 --> 05:14:52.160 align:start position:0%
they need to learn individual sports
 
05:14:54.948 --> 05:14:54.958 align:start position:0%
so that they have lifelong activity
 
05:14:56.470 --> 05:14:56.480 align:start position:0%
it's critical you know it's just
 
05:14:57.910 --> 05:14:57.920 align:start position:0%
critical so
 
05:14:59.750 --> 05:14:59.760 align:start position:0%
whenever you have a school you have a
 
05:15:01.910 --> 05:15:01.920 align:start position:0%
pie and you have a certain amount of
 
05:15:03.750 --> 05:15:03.760 align:start position:0%
money in a certain amount of time and a
 
05:15:05.910 --> 05:15:05.920 align:start position:0%
certain amount of staff
 
05:15:08.150 --> 05:15:08.160 align:start position:0%
and it's how you cut that pie up and i
 
05:15:10.470 --> 05:15:10.480 align:start position:0%
guess what we're trying to say is
 
05:15:12.390 --> 05:15:12.400 align:start position:0%
you know this is this is really i i
 
05:15:14.150 --> 05:15:14.160 align:start position:0%
guess everybody that comes in with these
 
05:15:15.670 --> 05:15:15.680 align:start position:0%
curriculum things are saying the same
 
05:15:18.230 --> 05:15:18.240 align:start position:0%
thing but basically this is this is you
 
05:15:20.948 --> 05:15:20.958 align:start position:0%
know life or death really i mean you can
 
05:15:22.788 --> 05:15:22.798 align:start position:0%
be philosophical and
 
05:15:24.390 --> 05:15:24.400 align:start position:0%
you know it doesn't really affect your
 
05:15:26.230 --> 05:15:26.240 align:start position:0%
life or death but if you're not
 
05:15:27.750 --> 05:15:27.760 align:start position:0%
physically fit
 
05:15:28.868 --> 05:15:28.878 align:start position:0%
if you're
 
05:15:30.948 --> 05:15:30.958 align:start position:0%
drastically overweight as a fourth or
 
05:15:32.470 --> 05:15:32.480 align:start position:0%
fifth grader
 
05:15:35.190 --> 05:15:35.200 align:start position:0%
um it's life or death you know it's a
 
05:15:37.190 --> 05:15:37.200 align:start position:0%
it's a death sentence for you
 
05:15:39.590 --> 05:15:39.600 align:start position:0%
so i think that's that's what the
 
05:15:42.150 --> 05:15:42.160 align:start position:0%
importance is in the priority and
 
05:15:45.670 --> 05:15:45.680 align:start position:0%
and there's the pie and as as mr fruit
 
05:15:47.990 --> 05:15:48.000 align:start position:0%
said you know the pie isn't ready to be
 
05:15:49.990 --> 05:15:50.000 align:start position:0%
split up it's not ready to talk right
 
05:15:51.670 --> 05:15:51.680 align:start position:0%
now but um
 
05:15:53.350 --> 05:15:53.360 align:start position:0%
it needs to be addressed in the future
 
05:15:54.868 --> 05:15:54.878 align:start position:0%
when we talk about curriculum and
 
05:15:54.878 --> 05:15:56.230 align:start position:0%
when we talk about curriculum and
standards

05:15:56.230 --> 05:15:56.240 align:start position:0%
standards
 
05:15:57.350 --> 05:15:57.360 align:start position:0%
thank you representative thank you very
 
05:15:58.868 --> 05:15:58.878 align:start position:0%

05:16:18.230 --> 05:16:18.240 align:start position:0%
is it dr o'neill
 
05:16:27.270 --> 05:16:27.280 align:start position:0%

you for considering this important bill
 
05:16:35.910 --> 05:16:35.920 align:start position:0%
thank you the previous speakers for
 
05:16:37.830 --> 05:16:37.840 align:start position:0%
emphasizing the fact that fitness is
 
05:16:39.670 --> 05:16:39.680 align:start position:0%
indeed the foundation
 
05:16:40.868 --> 05:16:40.878 align:start position:0%
has been the foundation of learning
 
05:16:43.830 --> 05:16:43.840 align:start position:0%
since the time of aristotle
 
05:16:45.670 --> 05:16:45.680 align:start position:0%
my name is dan o'neill i was the first
 
05:16:47.430 --> 05:16:47.440 align:start position:0%
orthopedic surgeon at spear memorial
 
05:16:49.030 --> 05:16:49.040 align:start position:0%

and multiple public schools
 
05:16:59.270 --> 05:16:59.280 align:start position:0%
i have served as a as a physician for
 
05:17:01.510 --> 05:17:01.520 align:start position:0%
the u.s alpine ski team in the us ski

jumping team
 
05:17:05.030 --> 05:17:05.040 align:start position:0%
feeling i was missing a large component
 
05:17:07.110 --> 05:17:07.120 align:start position:0%
of care i went back to school and
 
05:17:08.948 --> 05:17:08.958 align:start position:0%
received a doctorate in exercise and
 
05:17:11.910 --> 05:17:11.920 align:start position:0%
sports psychology from bu
 
05:17:14.310 --> 05:17:14.320 align:start position:0%
from these vagis points i have observed
 
05:17:17.110 --> 05:17:17.120 align:start position:0%
in the past 40 years the deterioration
 
05:17:18.390 --> 05:17:18.400 align:start position:0%
of children's fitness and their
 
05:17:20.230 --> 05:17:20.240 align:start position:0%
burgeoning addiction to two-dimensional
 
05:17:23.430 --> 05:17:23.440 align:start position:0%
entertainment and ultra processed foods
 
05:17:25.670 --> 05:17:25.680 align:start position:0%
this is what led me to write survival of
 
05:17:27.510 --> 05:17:27.520 align:start position:0%
the fit and what leads me to speak with
 
05:17:29.830 --> 05:17:29.840 align:start position:0%
you all today
 
05:17:31.750 --> 05:17:31.760 align:start position:0%
when we were children the concern as we
 
05:17:33.990 --> 05:17:34.000 align:start position:0%
stole our parents cigarettes was that we
 
05:17:35.510 --> 05:17:35.520 align:start position:0%
would become addicted and suffer from
 
05:17:38.390 --> 05:17:38.400 align:start position:0%
ephesians and lung cancer in our 60s
 
05:17:40.150 --> 05:17:40.160 align:start position:0%
i am here to tell you that many of our
 
05:17:42.150 --> 05:17:42.160 align:start position:0%
children are addicted and they are
 
05:17:43.590 --> 05:17:43.600 align:start position:0%
already sick
 
05:17:45.910 --> 05:17:45.920 align:start position:0%
they have diabetes high blood pressure
 
05:17:48.470 --> 05:17:48.480 align:start position:0%
anxiety and depression now
 
05:17:49.830 --> 05:17:49.840 align:start position:0%
they are not waiting until they're
 
05:17:49.840 --> 05:17:51.670 align:start position:0%
they are not waiting until they're
adults

05:17:51.670 --> 05:17:51.680 align:start position:0%
adults
 
05:17:53.510 --> 05:17:53.520 align:start position:0%
lack of fitness affects not just
 
05:17:54.788 --> 05:17:54.798 align:start position:0%
physical and mental health but
 
05:17:57.670 --> 05:17:57.680 align:start position:0%
everything about young people's lives
 
05:17:59.510 --> 05:17:59.520 align:start position:0%
study after study shows that poor
 
05:18:01.910 --> 05:18:01.920 align:start position:0%
fitness limits the ability to learn and
 
05:18:04.150 --> 05:18:04.160 align:start position:0%
thus has a huge effect on academic
 
05:18:04.160 --> 05:18:05.670 align:start position:0%
thus has a huge effect on academic
performance

05:18:05.670 --> 05:18:05.680 align:start position:0%
performance
 
05:18:07.750 --> 05:18:07.760 align:start position:0%
we know without a doubt that a sedentary
 
05:18:10.310 --> 05:18:10.320 align:start position:0%
child is not assimilating information or
 
05:18:12.390 --> 05:18:12.400 align:start position:0%
thinking to their full potential
 
05:18:14.948 --> 05:18:14.958 align:start position:0%
in other words there is no stem genius
 
05:18:17.590 --> 05:18:17.600 align:start position:0%
without fitness
 
05:18:19.590 --> 05:18:19.600 align:start position:0%
american children have less physical
 
05:18:21.590 --> 05:18:21.600 align:start position:0%
physical education or gym class than any
 
05:18:24.708 --> 05:18:24.718 align:start position:0%
child since school was made compulsory
 
05:18:26.230 --> 05:18:26.240 align:start position:0%
for those students whose parents have
 
05:18:27.830 --> 05:18:27.840 align:start position:0%
the means to combat this sedentary
 
05:18:30.390 --> 05:18:30.400 align:start position:0%
lifestyle with enrolling them in sports
 
05:18:33.990 --> 05:18:34.000 align:start position:0%
75 percent quit by the age of 15.
 
05:18:36.230 --> 05:18:36.240 align:start position:0%
physiologically however we are the same
 
05:18:38.390 --> 05:18:38.400 align:start position:0%
hunter-gatherer as we were 200 000 years
 
05:18:38.400 --> 05:18:39.430 align:start position:0%
hunter-gatherer as we were 200 000 years
ago

05:18:39.430 --> 05:18:39.440 align:start position:0%
ago
 
05:18:41.830 --> 05:18:41.840 align:start position:0%
we are at a program to walk or run 10
 
05:18:43.510 --> 05:18:43.520 align:start position:0%
miles a day and eat a wide variety of
 
05:18:43.520 --> 05:18:45.110 align:start position:0%
miles a day and eat a wide variety of
foods

05:18:45.110 --> 05:18:45.120 align:start position:0%
foods
 
05:18:47.350 --> 05:18:47.360 align:start position:0%
hunter-gatherer as we have as dr kaner
 
05:18:49.430 --> 05:18:49.440 align:start position:0%
described what i call a physical
 
05:18:49.440 --> 05:18:50.868 align:start position:0%
described what i call a physical
identity

05:18:50.868 --> 05:18:50.878 align:start position:0%
identity
 
05:18:53.030 --> 05:18:53.040 align:start position:0%
this is how we move how we explore the
 
05:18:55.590 --> 05:18:55.600 align:start position:0%
outdoors how we respond to nature what
 
05:18:57.510 --> 05:18:57.520 align:start position:0%
we do
 
05:18:59.510 --> 05:18:59.520 align:start position:0%
children are born as active curious
 
05:19:01.670 --> 05:19:01.680 align:start position:0%
motion loving beings with a built-in
 
05:19:04.230 --> 05:19:04.240 align:start position:0%
physical identity
 
05:19:06.868 --> 05:19:06.878 align:start position:0%
the solution theo to the obesity crisis
 
05:19:08.948 --> 05:19:08.958 align:start position:0%
is simply not to allow physical identity
 
05:19:10.230 --> 05:19:10.240 align:start position:0%
to lapse
 
05:19:12.628 --> 05:19:12.638 align:start position:0%
daily physical education for every child
 
05:19:14.868 --> 05:19:14.878 align:start position:0%
every day every year of school is our
 
05:19:16.708 --> 05:19:16.718 align:start position:0%
only chance of maintaining a child's
 
05:19:19.110 --> 05:19:19.120 align:start position:0%
physical identity to ensure a happy
 
05:19:21.430 --> 05:19:21.440 align:start position:0%
healthy life
 
05:19:24.070 --> 05:19:24.080 align:start position:0%
six children cost the state millions of
 
05:19:25.830 --> 05:19:25.840 align:start position:0%
dollars today
 
05:19:28.390 --> 05:19:28.400 align:start position:0%
daily physical education is a low-cost
 
05:19:31.030 --> 05:19:31.040 align:start position:0%
low-tech game changer
 
05:19:32.788 --> 05:19:32.798 align:start position:0%
finally when discussing cost and
 
05:19:35.110 --> 05:19:35.120 align:start position:0%
implementation i can assure you that
 
05:19:36.948 --> 05:19:36.958 align:start position:0%
physical education is less expensive
 
05:19:39.350 --> 05:19:39.360 align:start position:0%
than the health care costs and as all
 
05:19:41.190 --> 05:19:41.200 align:start position:0%
you know all of you in this committee
 
05:19:43.270 --> 05:19:43.280 align:start position:0%
know seeing the recent numbers to
 
05:19:45.350 --> 05:19:45.360 align:start position:0%
finance more mental health facilities
 
05:19:48.628 --> 05:19:48.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:49.990 --> 05:19:50.000 align:start position:0%
in the course of writing this book and
 
05:19:51.830 --> 05:19:51.840 align:start position:0%
starting this campaign i have spoken to
 
05:19:53.350 --> 05:19:53.360 align:start position:0%
many school administrators and
 
05:19:56.310 --> 05:19:56.320 align:start position:0%
principals as well as teachers in my
 
05:19:57.750 --> 05:19:57.760 align:start position:0%
last few minutes of testimony i would
 
05:19:59.350 --> 05:19:59.360 align:start position:0%
like to highlight some of what they have
 
05:20:01.510 --> 05:20:01.520 align:start position:0%
shared with me as covet and scheduling
 
05:20:04.550 --> 05:20:04.560 align:start position:0%
issues did not allow their attendance
 
05:20:06.628 --> 05:20:06.638 align:start position:0%
educators today are in an untenable
 
05:20:06.638 --> 05:20:08.150 align:start position:0%
educators today are in an untenable
situation

05:20:08.150 --> 05:20:08.160 align:start position:0%
situation
 
05:20:11.270 --> 05:20:11.280 align:start position:0%
we have been asked to put more into a
 
05:20:13.190 --> 05:20:13.200 align:start position:0%
school day than is even metaphysically
 
05:20:13.200 --> 05:20:14.708 align:start position:0%
school day than is even metaphysically
possible

05:20:14.708 --> 05:20:14.718 align:start position:0%
possible
 
05:20:16.628 --> 05:20:16.638 align:start position:0%
when no child left behind was passed in
 
05:20:19.510 --> 05:20:19.520 align:start position:0%
2002 the main impetus was to improve
 
05:20:21.670 --> 05:20:21.680 align:start position:0%
math and english scores
 
05:20:23.510 --> 05:20:23.520 align:start position:0%
increased time in these subjects by and
 
05:20:26.628 --> 05:20:26.638 align:start position:0%
large came from physical education
 
05:20:28.628 --> 05:20:28.638 align:start position:0%
sadly in the past 10 years more time in
 
05:20:30.230 --> 05:20:30.240 align:start position:0%
these subjects has not led to the hope
 
05:20:32.948 --> 05:20:32.958 align:start position:0%
for results and test scores have stayed
 
05:20:34.868 --> 05:20:34.878 align:start position:0%
essentially static
 
05:20:36.788 --> 05:20:36.798 align:start position:0%
what has gone up however in the last 10
 
05:20:39.030 --> 05:20:39.040 align:start position:0%
years is student obesity
 
05:20:41.350 --> 05:20:41.360 align:start position:0%
this idea of enacting change by just
 
05:20:43.990 --> 05:20:44.000 align:start position:0%
saying no to our students does not work
 
05:20:46.070 --> 05:20:46.080 align:start position:0%
once they are addicted and we use that
 
05:20:48.390 --> 05:20:48.400 align:start position:0%
word deliberately as we are indeed
 
05:20:50.868 --> 05:20:50.878 align:start position:0%
addicted to media and bad food
 
05:20:52.948 --> 05:20:52.958 align:start position:0%
this becomes a battle most parents and
 
05:20:54.868 --> 05:20:54.878 align:start position:0%
ourselves as educators are ill-equipped
 
05:20:56.310 --> 05:20:56.320 align:start position:0%
to fight
 
05:20:58.150 --> 05:20:58.160 align:start position:0%
we will not solve this problem with a
 
05:20:58.160 --> 05:20:59.110 align:start position:0%
we will not solve this problem with a
negative

05:20:59.110 --> 05:20:59.120 align:start position:0%
negative
 
05:21:01.270 --> 05:21:01.280 align:start position:0%
we must work so children never become
 
05:21:02.788 --> 05:21:02.798 align:start position:0%
addicted and
 
05:21:05.430 --> 05:21:05.440 align:start position:0%
make this happen with a positive
 
05:21:07.110 --> 05:21:07.120 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire we have the ally of
 
05:21:09.590 --> 05:21:09.600 align:start position:0%
mother nature thus there is no excuse
 
05:21:11.110 --> 05:21:11.120 align:start position:0%
for not making sure our children are
 
05:21:13.510 --> 05:21:13.520 align:start position:0%
addicted to going outside not call of
 
05:21:13.520 --> 05:21:15.590 align:start position:0%
addicted to going outside not call of
duty

05:21:15.590 --> 05:21:15.600 align:start position:0%
duty
 
05:21:19.190 --> 05:21:19.200 align:start position:0%
we appreciate as educators that hbo 1263
 
05:21:21.590 --> 05:21:21.600 align:start position:0%
could add another mandate for time to
 
05:21:23.590 --> 05:21:23.600 align:start position:0%
the schedule however
 
05:21:25.750 --> 05:21:25.760 align:start position:0%
any studies or data regarding education
 
05:21:27.190 --> 05:21:27.200 align:start position:0%
that is more than 10 years old is
 
05:21:29.110 --> 05:21:29.120 align:start position:0%
essentially worthless because the world
 
05:21:30.628 --> 05:21:30.638 align:start position:0%
has changed
 
05:21:32.788 --> 05:21:32.798 align:start position:0%
we are asking legislators to recognize
 
05:21:34.548 --> 05:21:34.558 align:start position:0%
this and allow schools to make changes
 
05:21:37.030 --> 05:21:37.040 align:start position:0%
that reflect educational challenges in
 
05:21:37.040 --> 05:21:39.190 align:start position:0%
that reflect educational challenges in
2022

05:21:39.190 --> 05:21:39.200 align:start position:0%
2022
 
05:21:41.190 --> 05:21:41.200 align:start position:0%
most educators and politicians grew up
 
05:21:42.948 --> 05:21:42.958 align:start position:0%
in a much different world
 
05:21:45.750 --> 05:21:45.760 align:start position:0%
if we can provide 180 days of activity
 
05:21:47.510 --> 05:21:47.520 align:start position:0%
and impress upon parents the importance
 
05:21:49.430 --> 05:21:49.440 align:start position:0%
of getting outside on weekends and in
 
05:21:50.470 --> 05:21:50.480 align:start position:0%
the summer
 
05:21:52.150 --> 05:21:52.160 align:start position:0%
this might be the greatest thing we can
 
05:21:54.310 --> 05:21:54.320 align:start position:0%
do for academic achievement
 
05:21:55.750 --> 05:21:55.760 align:start position:0%
we know the best guard against
 
05:21:58.070 --> 05:21:58.080 align:start position:0%
alzheimer's is physical fitness why
 
05:21:59.750 --> 05:21:59.760 align:start position:0%
would we not think the same would be
 
05:22:03.350 --> 05:22:03.360 align:start position:0%
true for a young brain
 
05:22:05.750 --> 05:22:05.760 align:start position:0%
here in the in the in the granite state
 
05:22:07.190 --> 05:22:07.200 align:start position:0%
we have the teachers we have the
 
05:22:09.110 --> 05:22:09.120 align:start position:0%
knowledge for this physical education
 
05:22:11.590 --> 05:22:11.600 align:start position:0%
revolution we can improve our the health
 
05:22:15.670 --> 05:22:15.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:17.670 --> 05:22:17.680 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very much doctor uh
 
05:22:21.750 --> 05:22:21.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:23.990 --> 05:22:24.000 align:start position:0%
i i have i have a question for you dr
 
05:22:26.788 --> 05:22:26.798 align:start position:0%
neil do you want oliver ford
 
05:22:31.590 --> 05:22:31.600 align:start position:0%
okay my question is dealing with um
 
05:22:33.270 --> 05:22:33.280 align:start position:0%
have grandchildren
 
05:22:35.270 --> 05:22:35.280 align:start position:0%
as most of us do
 
05:22:37.190 --> 05:22:37.200 align:start position:0%
and we'd like to see them outside
 
05:22:41.750 --> 05:22:41.760 align:start position:0%
playing rather than doing the xbox thing
 
05:22:44.470 --> 05:22:44.480 align:start position:0%
so i'm also looking though at this 150
 
05:22:47.190 --> 05:22:47.200 align:start position:0%
minutes and 225 minutes
 
05:22:50.070 --> 05:22:50.080 align:start position:0%
uh does this include recess
 
05:22:52.628 --> 05:22:52.638 align:start position:0%
or is that we talking about a direct
 
05:22:54.868 --> 05:22:54.878 align:start position:0%
physical education instruction
 
05:22:56.548 --> 05:22:56.558 align:start position:0%
by way of a class
 
05:22:58.390 --> 05:22:58.400 align:start position:0%
yeah as representative tanner pointed
 
05:22:58.400 --> 05:22:59.830 align:start position:0%
yeah as representative tanner pointed
out

05:22:59.830 --> 05:22:59.840 align:start position:0%
out
 
05:23:01.590 --> 05:23:01.600 align:start position:0%
recess is not the same thing and the
 
05:23:03.910 --> 05:23:03.920 align:start position:0%
older kids get the less they move at
 
05:23:05.750 --> 05:23:05.760 align:start position:0%
recess and that is the crux of
 
05:23:05.760 --> 05:23:07.110 align:start position:0%
recess and that is the crux of
everything

05:23:07.110 --> 05:23:07.120 align:start position:0%
everything
 
05:23:09.670 --> 05:23:09.680 align:start position:0%
150 minutes of pe
 
05:23:11.350 --> 05:23:11.360 align:start position:0%
and as a
 
05:23:14.150 --> 05:23:14.160 align:start position:0%
liz savage will tell you having a proper
 
05:23:15.990 --> 05:23:16.000 align:start position:0%
physical education instructor or
 
05:23:18.548 --> 05:23:18.558 align:start position:0%
physical education assistant as i talk
 
05:23:19.830 --> 05:23:19.840 align:start position:0%
about in the book
 
05:23:21.910 --> 05:23:21.920 align:start position:0%
helping these kids stay moving for that
 
05:23:24.548 --> 05:23:24.558 align:start position:0%
30 minutes a day in elementary school is
 
05:23:27.590 --> 05:23:27.600 align:start position:0%
absolutely vital this way we're getting
 
05:23:29.350 --> 05:23:29.360 align:start position:0%
their heart rates up but more
 
05:23:30.788 --> 05:23:30.798 align:start position:0%
importantly we're getting their brain
 
05:23:32.150 --> 05:23:32.160 align:start position:0%
stimulated and that's what's going to
 
05:23:33.590 --> 05:23:33.600 align:start position:0%
happen when they go back into the
 
05:23:35.830 --> 05:23:35.840 align:start position:0%
classroom we need to get their heart
 
05:23:37.430 --> 05:23:37.440 align:start position:0%
rates up we need to get
 
05:23:39.190 --> 05:23:39.200 align:start position:0%
their blood moving
 
05:23:41.030 --> 05:23:41.040 align:start position:0%
standing around is not going to do it
 
05:23:42.628 --> 05:23:42.638 align:start position:0%
and we know as the kids get older and
 
05:23:44.390 --> 05:23:44.400 align:start position:0%
older they stand around more and more
 
05:23:46.470 --> 05:23:46.480 align:start position:0%
which is why the middle and high school
 
05:23:48.708 --> 05:23:48.718 align:start position:0%
numbers should be closer to 45 minutes a
 
05:23:48.718 --> 05:23:50.470 align:start position:0%
numbers should be closer to 45 minutes a
day

05:23:50.470 --> 05:23:50.480 align:start position:0%
day
 
05:23:53.270 --> 05:23:53.280 align:start position:0%
this can be done but it is going to take
 
05:23:54.788 --> 05:23:54.798 align:start position:0%
some arrangements and it is going to
 
05:23:54.798 --> 05:23:55.670 align:start position:0%
some arrangements and it is going to
take

05:23:55.670 --> 05:23:55.680 align:start position:0%
take
 
05:23:58.310 --> 05:23:58.320 align:start position:0%
some support with more pe teachers and
 
05:24:00.868 --> 05:24:00.878 align:start position:0%
more pe teacher assistants which at this
 
05:24:04.708 --> 05:24:04.718 align:start position:0%
point essentially don't exist
 
05:24:06.948 --> 05:24:06.958 align:start position:0%
so a follow-up question doctor um is
 
05:24:08.310 --> 05:24:08.320 align:start position:0%
there any benefit to the regular
 
05:24:09.670 --> 05:24:09.680 align:start position:0%
classroom teacher in the elementary
 
05:24:09.680 --> 05:24:11.110 align:start position:0%
classroom teacher in the elementary
school

05:24:11.110 --> 05:24:11.120 align:start position:0%
school
 
05:24:12.628 --> 05:24:12.638 align:start position:0%
taking them outside and running around
 
05:24:14.788 --> 05:24:14.798 align:start position:0%
the soccer field prior to getting into
 
05:24:16.470 --> 05:24:16.480 align:start position:0%
the academic star i did that every
 
05:24:18.230 --> 05:24:18.240 align:start position:0%
morning as an elementary teacher first
 
05:24:20.310 --> 05:24:20.320 align:start position:0%
thing we go run the field
 
05:24:22.470 --> 05:24:22.480 align:start position:0%
everything that's exactly right and
 
05:24:24.548 --> 05:24:24.558 align:start position:0%
that's becomes a culture one of the
 
05:24:26.150 --> 05:24:26.160 align:start position:0%
schools that i'm involved with is
 
05:24:28.070 --> 05:24:28.080 align:start position:0%
holding a school and and as you know
 
05:24:30.230 --> 05:24:30.240 align:start position:0%
many of the private schools
 
05:24:31.350 --> 05:24:31.360 align:start position:0%
they are
 
05:24:31.360 --> 05:24:32.390 align:start position:0%
they are
getting

05:24:32.390 --> 05:24:32.400 align:start position:0%
getting
 
05:24:32.400 --> 05:24:33.910 align:start position:0%
getting
athletics

05:24:33.910 --> 05:24:33.920 align:start position:0%
athletics
 
05:24:36.470 --> 05:24:36.480 align:start position:0%
physical education sports every day they
 
05:24:38.788 --> 05:24:38.798 align:start position:0%
know the importance of doing this they
 
05:24:41.590 --> 05:24:41.600 align:start position:0%
know that that's what stimulates brains
 
05:24:43.030 --> 05:24:43.040 align:start position:0%
to assimilate
 
05:24:45.270 --> 05:24:45.280 align:start position:0%
intellectual information that's what we
 
05:24:46.868 --> 05:24:46.878 align:start position:0%
need to do in our public schools there's
 
05:24:49.270 --> 05:24:49.280 align:start position:0%
absolutely no reason we can't do that
 
05:24:51.350 --> 05:24:51.360 align:start position:0%
and it has to be a culture and as you
 
05:24:51.360 --> 05:24:52.548 align:start position:0%
and it has to be a culture and as you
say

05:24:52.548 --> 05:24:52.558 align:start position:0%
say
 
05:24:54.788 --> 05:24:54.798 align:start position:0%
representative getting the math teachers
 
05:24:56.628 --> 05:24:56.638 align:start position:0%
and the and the art teachers and making
 
05:24:59.350 --> 05:24:59.360 align:start position:0%
sure in art class they're going out into
 
05:25:01.030 --> 05:25:01.040 align:start position:0%
the woods and painting and doing
 
05:25:02.948 --> 05:25:02.958 align:start position:0%
photography and getting the band
 
05:25:05.190 --> 05:25:05.200 align:start position:0%
teachers to have them marching and and
 
05:25:07.190 --> 05:25:07.200 align:start position:0%
and on on it's always about movement
 
05:25:09.270 --> 05:25:09.280 align:start position:0%
everybody's in motion and it does have
 
05:25:11.190 --> 05:25:11.200 align:start position:0%
to be something going from the lunch
 
05:25:13.590 --> 05:25:13.600 align:start position:0%
ladies to the the custodians to
 
05:25:14.868 --> 05:25:14.878 align:start position:0%
everybody on up through the
 
05:25:16.868 --> 05:25:16.878 align:start position:0%
administrators to make sure that our
 
05:25:18.788 --> 05:25:18.798 align:start position:0%
school is in motion and that's really
 
05:25:20.310 --> 05:25:20.320 align:start position:0%
what's going to make the difference
 
05:25:23.670 --> 05:25:23.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:29.270 --> 05:25:29.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:32.628 --> 05:25:32.638 align:start position:0%
is your uh
 
05:25:34.868 --> 05:25:34.878 align:start position:0%
there you go
 
05:25:36.310 --> 05:25:36.320 align:start position:0%
david and i've been fighting for this
 
05:25:37.910 --> 05:25:37.920 align:start position:0%
mic all this session
 
05:25:37.920 --> 05:25:40.470 align:start position:0%
mic all this session
um

05:25:40.470 --> 05:25:40.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:43.670 --> 05:25:43.680 align:start position:0%
i've done a lot of physical education
 
05:25:46.708 --> 05:25:46.718 align:start position:0%
out of the school setting i'm a judo
 
05:25:46.718 --> 05:25:47.830 align:start position:0%
out of the school setting i'm a judo
instructor

05:25:47.830 --> 05:25:47.840 align:start position:0%
instructor
 
05:25:49.750 --> 05:25:49.760 align:start position:0%
i teach hunting and fishing and things
 
05:25:51.030 --> 05:25:51.040 align:start position:0%
like that
 
05:25:53.510 --> 05:25:53.520 align:start position:0%
and i've been engaged with children
 
05:25:55.350 --> 05:25:55.360 align:start position:0%
outside the school
 
05:25:55.360 --> 05:25:56.548 align:start position:0%
outside the school
day

05:25:56.548 --> 05:25:56.558 align:start position:0%
day
 
05:25:58.868 --> 05:25:58.878 align:start position:0%
and perhaps it's because i went to
 
05:26:00.390 --> 05:26:00.400 align:start position:0%
school as a child
 
05:26:02.788 --> 05:26:02.798 align:start position:0%
when you walk to school
 
05:26:05.110 --> 05:26:05.120 align:start position:0%
and so we had a pretty good workout just
 
05:26:07.190 --> 05:26:07.200 align:start position:0%
getting to school and going home from
 
05:26:07.200 --> 05:26:07.990 align:start position:0%
getting to school and going home from
school

05:26:07.990 --> 05:26:08.000 align:start position:0%
school
 
05:26:09.410 --> 05:26:09.420 align:start position:0%
and that was uphill
 
05:26:09.420 --> 05:26:11.750 align:start position:0%
and that was uphill
[Music]

05:26:11.750 --> 05:26:11.760 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
05:26:13.430 --> 05:26:13.440 align:start position:0%
i grew up in
 
05:26:17.430 --> 05:26:17.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:17.440 --> 05:26:19.270 align:start position:0%
 
the

05:26:19.270 --> 05:26:19.280 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:26:21.270 --> 05:26:21.280 align:start position:0%
the issue of organized sports and
 
05:26:23.110 --> 05:26:23.120 align:start position:0%
competitive sports of that sort was
 
05:26:25.750 --> 05:26:25.760 align:start position:0%
always addressed through the cub scouts
 
05:26:27.830 --> 05:26:27.840 align:start position:0%
to extra things to things done on
 
05:26:29.590 --> 05:26:29.600 align:start position:0%
saturday through the kind of judo
 
05:26:31.750 --> 05:26:31.760 align:start position:0%
courses i talked for the y
 
05:26:33.990 --> 05:26:34.000 align:start position:0%
it was always another thing that was
 
05:26:36.628 --> 05:26:36.638 align:start position:0%
done but it wasn't forced on the schools
 
05:26:38.470 --> 05:26:38.480 align:start position:0%
to have to deliver it
 
05:26:40.628 --> 05:26:40.638 align:start position:0%
it was probably out either out of
 
05:26:42.868 --> 05:26:42.878 align:start position:0%
interest or parental interest or
 
05:26:42.878 --> 05:26:44.708 align:start position:0%
interest or parental interest or
whatever

05:26:44.708 --> 05:26:44.718 align:start position:0%
whatever
 
05:26:46.948 --> 05:26:46.958 align:start position:0%
and so i'm wondering if maybe
 
05:26:46.958 --> 05:26:47.830 align:start position:0%
and so i'm wondering if maybe
we're

05:26:47.830 --> 05:26:47.840 align:start position:0%
we're
 
05:26:49.990 --> 05:26:50.000 align:start position:0%
overreaching and trying to require the
 
05:26:52.548 --> 05:26:52.558 align:start position:0%
school structure to take up this which
 
05:26:55.350 --> 05:26:55.360 align:start position:0%
is admittedly a time consuming process
 
05:26:56.868 --> 05:26:56.878 align:start position:0%
but i never would have learned how to
 
05:26:58.708 --> 05:26:58.718 align:start position:0%
fence if i had to do it in school they
 
05:27:00.708 --> 05:27:00.718 align:start position:0%
would have been scared to death
 
05:27:03.590 --> 05:27:03.600 align:start position:0%
you know we can't have seeds with swords
 
05:27:06.470 --> 05:27:06.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:08.310 --> 05:27:08.320 align:start position:0%
you can't have kids playing judo where
 
05:27:10.548 --> 05:27:10.558 align:start position:0%
they might hurt you but you can
 
05:27:13.350 --> 05:27:13.360 align:start position:0%
you know and so it's all a matter of of
 
05:27:15.270 --> 05:27:15.280 align:start position:0%
setting it up and setting the conditions
 
05:27:17.750 --> 05:27:17.760 align:start position:0%
for it but also having the motivation to
 
05:27:19.750 --> 05:27:19.760 align:start position:0%
fulfill that need that you've identified
 
05:27:21.190 --> 05:27:21.200 align:start position:0%
so so well
 
05:27:22.548 --> 05:27:22.558 align:start position:0%
and i'm just wondering what you think
 
05:27:24.948 --> 05:27:24.958 align:start position:0%
about the role of things outside of
 
05:27:24.958 --> 05:27:25.990 align:start position:0%
about the role of things outside of
school

05:27:25.990 --> 05:27:26.000 align:start position:0%
school
 
05:27:28.070 --> 05:27:28.080 align:start position:0%
well well clearly representative ford
 
05:27:31.030 --> 05:27:31.040 align:start position:0%
you read my book already and um
 
05:27:34.628 --> 05:27:34.638 align:start position:0%
so you point out three major topics here
 
05:27:35.830 --> 05:27:35.840 align:start position:0%
number one
 
05:27:37.990 --> 05:27:38.000 align:start position:0%
you have a physical identity
 
05:27:39.750 --> 05:27:39.760 align:start position:0%
representative tanner representative
 
05:27:42.150 --> 05:27:42.160 align:start position:0%
canuck have physical identities so many
 
05:27:44.390 --> 05:27:44.400 align:start position:0%
of you that have already talked you have
 
05:27:46.150 --> 05:27:46.160 align:start position:0%
a physical identity because you need to
 
05:27:48.230 --> 05:27:48.240 align:start position:0%
get outside and after a day sitting in
 
05:27:50.310 --> 05:27:50.320 align:start position:0%
this room you want to be outside you
 
05:27:52.788 --> 05:27:52.798 align:start position:0%
want to get that dog and go for a walk
 
05:27:54.390 --> 05:27:54.400 align:start position:0%
that's having a physical identity that's
 
05:27:57.110 --> 05:27:57.120 align:start position:0%
what was established with you at a young
 
05:27:57.120 --> 05:27:57.990 align:start position:0%
what was established with you at a young
age

05:27:57.990 --> 05:27:58.000 align:start position:0%
age
 
05:28:00.788 --> 05:28:00.798 align:start position:0%
number two the community has to be a big
 
05:28:03.190 --> 05:28:03.200 align:start position:0%
part of this we have put organized
 
05:28:06.310 --> 05:28:06.320 align:start position:0%
sports into our school system and only a
 
05:28:08.070 --> 05:28:08.080 align:start position:0%
small percentage of our school students
 
05:28:10.390 --> 05:28:10.400 align:start position:0%
take advantage of those organized sports
 
05:28:13.110 --> 05:28:13.120 align:start position:0%
that should be more a community issue
 
05:28:15.990 --> 05:28:16.000 align:start position:0%
but every child deserves physical
 
05:28:17.830 --> 05:28:17.840 align:start position:0%
education every child deserves to get
 
05:28:20.150 --> 05:28:20.160 align:start position:0%
their heart rate up every day and that's
 
05:28:23.190 --> 05:28:23.200 align:start position:0%
why we need to have this and again this
 
05:28:26.868 --> 05:28:26.878 align:start position:0%
is 2022 it is nothing like when we were
 
05:28:29.110 --> 05:28:29.120 align:start position:0%
kids when we went to school when we got
 
05:28:31.110 --> 05:28:31.120 align:start position:0%
out of school and we ran in the woods
 
05:28:33.190 --> 05:28:33.200 align:start position:0%
and we rode our bikes and we caused all
 
05:28:34.470 --> 05:28:34.480 align:start position:0%
kinds of trouble
 
05:28:37.110 --> 05:28:37.120 align:start position:0%
until the sun went down it is not like
 
05:28:39.270 --> 05:28:39.280 align:start position:0%
that anymore because these kids have
 
05:28:41.910 --> 05:28:41.920 align:start position:0%
this incredible of
 
05:28:44.230 --> 05:28:44.240 align:start position:0%
evil that they're drawn to and they're
 
05:28:46.230 --> 05:28:46.240 align:start position:0%
literally addicted to and this is the
 
05:28:47.670 --> 05:28:47.680 align:start position:0%
other main
 
05:28:49.750 --> 05:28:49.760 align:start position:0%
part of this we have to start the kids
 
05:28:52.470 --> 05:28:52.480 align:start position:0%
at first grade and what i would when we
 
05:28:54.628 --> 05:28:54.638 align:start position:0%
talk about changing the legislation what
 
05:28:57.030 --> 05:28:57.040 align:start position:0%
i would say is we start with first grade
 
05:28:58.548 --> 05:28:58.558 align:start position:0%
and then we go first and second grade
 
05:29:00.070 --> 05:29:00.080 align:start position:0%
then first second third and we go on
 
05:29:01.670 --> 05:29:01.680 align:start position:0%
from there because if we went into the
 
05:29:03.270 --> 05:29:03.280 align:start position:0%
high school at kearsarge high school
 
05:29:06.070 --> 05:29:06.080 align:start position:0%
today and we told the 16 year olds that
 
05:29:07.670 --> 05:29:07.680 align:start position:0%
they have to get their heart rates up
 
05:29:10.070 --> 05:29:10.080 align:start position:0%
for 45 minutes a day good luck with that
 
05:29:11.750 --> 05:29:11.760 align:start position:0%
and i wouldn't put that on any principal
 
05:29:14.548 --> 05:29:14.558 align:start position:0%
or teacher but kids have the physical
 
05:29:16.310 --> 05:29:16.320 align:start position:0%
identity we just have to make sure they
 
05:29:19.270 --> 05:29:19.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:21.430 --> 05:29:21.440 align:start position:0%
thank you very much uh
 
05:29:24.948 --> 05:29:24.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:24.958 --> 05:29:26.230 align:start position:0%
 
so

05:29:26.230 --> 05:29:26.240 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:29:27.910 --> 05:29:27.920 align:start position:0%
you know as well as i do that the way
 
05:29:29.750 --> 05:29:29.760 align:start position:0%
private schools get away with requiring
 
05:29:31.270 --> 05:29:31.280 align:start position:0%
sports for every
 
05:29:33.350 --> 05:29:33.360 align:start position:0%
student is they do it after school they
 
05:29:35.910 --> 05:29:35.920 align:start position:0%
do it outside of academic hours
 
05:29:38.230 --> 05:29:38.240 align:start position:0%
so i'm wondering if perhaps instead of
 
05:29:40.230 --> 05:29:40.240 align:start position:0%
trying to impose something more on the
 
05:29:42.230 --> 05:29:42.240 align:start position:0%
educational day which is already crammed
 
05:29:44.470 --> 05:29:44.480 align:start position:0%
way too full in our schools here and
 
05:29:46.470 --> 05:29:46.480 align:start position:0%
elsewhere in the country if we shouldn't
 
05:29:48.390 --> 05:29:48.400 align:start position:0%
be looking at a model maybe where there
 
05:29:51.670 --> 05:29:51.680 align:start position:0%
is more physical activity offered after
 
05:29:51.680 --> 05:29:52.628 align:start position:0%
is more physical activity offered after
school

05:29:52.628 --> 05:29:52.638 align:start position:0%
school
 
05:29:54.948 --> 05:29:54.958 align:start position:0%
that you know we provide transportation
 
05:29:56.548 --> 05:29:56.558 align:start position:0%
and the district i grew up in there were
 
05:29:58.150 --> 05:29:58.160 align:start position:0%
two buses there was an after-school bus
 
05:30:00.310 --> 05:30:00.320 align:start position:0%
there was an after sports bus so that
 
05:30:01.830 --> 05:30:01.840 align:start position:0%
you didn't have to rely on mom and dad
 
05:30:02.948 --> 05:30:02.958 align:start position:0%
to get home
 
05:30:06.150 --> 05:30:06.160 align:start position:0%
and so it was just built into the system
 
05:30:08.708 --> 05:30:08.718 align:start position:0%
and i'm wondering if that isn't a more
 
05:30:10.948 --> 05:30:10.958 align:start position:0%
realistic approach to this
 
05:30:13.670 --> 05:30:13.680 align:start position:0%
to have instead of trying to as i say
 
05:30:16.390 --> 05:30:16.400 align:start position:0%
cram this into the academic day but but
 
05:30:18.868 --> 05:30:18.878 align:start position:0%
have an extended day and maybe offer
 
05:30:21.830 --> 05:30:21.840 align:start position:0%
something like fencing or tennis or
 
05:30:23.510 --> 05:30:23.520 align:start position:0%
things that are not traditional team
 
05:30:26.470 --> 05:30:26.480 align:start position:0%
sports but things that can be uh
 
05:30:27.750 --> 05:30:27.760 align:start position:0%
somebody can carry with them for a
 
05:30:27.760 --> 05:30:29.350 align:start position:0%
somebody can carry with them for a
lifetime

05:30:29.350 --> 05:30:29.360 align:start position:0%
lifetime
 
05:30:31.110 --> 05:30:31.120 align:start position:0%
there is no stem
 
05:30:33.350 --> 05:30:33.360 align:start position:0%
without fitness
 
05:30:35.190 --> 05:30:35.200 align:start position:0%
the problem is we're leaving behind as
 
05:30:36.788 --> 05:30:36.798 align:start position:0%
soon as we make it and after school as
 
05:30:38.628 --> 05:30:38.638 align:start position:0%
soon as we make it optional the rich
 
05:30:40.548 --> 05:30:40.558 align:start position:0%
keep getting richer the kids that
 
05:30:42.230 --> 05:30:42.240 align:start position:0%
already have their physical identities
 
05:30:43.430 --> 05:30:43.440 align:start position:0%
the kids that have parents that are
 
05:30:45.590 --> 05:30:45.600 align:start position:0%
willing to do that the kids that have
 
05:30:47.830 --> 05:30:47.840 align:start position:0%
the wherewithal or the parental
 
05:30:50.310 --> 05:30:50.320 align:start position:0%
wherewithal to do that we need to make
 
05:30:52.390 --> 05:30:52.400 align:start position:0%
this for every child we can't let
 
05:30:53.750 --> 05:30:53.760 align:start position:0%
anybody out
 
05:30:55.270 --> 05:30:55.280 align:start position:0%
everybody's got to be doing this because
 
05:30:57.270 --> 05:30:57.280 align:start position:0%
that's how important this is that's how
 
05:30:59.510 --> 05:30:59.520 align:start position:0%
important and miss savage is going to
 
05:31:01.590 --> 05:31:01.600 align:start position:0%
talk about this these fundamental
 
05:31:03.510 --> 05:31:03.520 align:start position:0%
movement patterns are
 
05:31:05.110 --> 05:31:05.120 align:start position:0%
we can't just keep letting the rich get
 
05:31:06.868 --> 05:31:06.878 align:start position:0%
richer the what i thought you were going
 
05:31:08.390 --> 05:31:08.400 align:start position:0%
to talk about is extending the school
 
05:31:11.590 --> 05:31:11.600 align:start position:0%
day which is a black box that that i
 
05:31:14.470 --> 05:31:14.480 align:start position:0%
would not want to open however
 
05:31:15.590 --> 05:31:15.600 align:start position:0%
right now
 
05:31:17.990 --> 05:31:18.000 align:start position:0%
the time that these kids are spending in
 
05:31:21.110 --> 05:31:21.120 align:start position:0%
english and math and science is not
 
05:31:23.430 --> 05:31:23.440 align:start position:0%
useful because they are not fit enough
 
05:31:25.670 --> 05:31:25.680 align:start position:0%
to learn and that's an incredibly
 
05:31:29.190 --> 05:31:29.200 align:start position:0%
important concept that again most of us
 
05:31:31.270 --> 05:31:31.280 align:start position:0%
have a hard time understanding because
 
05:31:33.510 --> 05:31:33.520 align:start position:0%
we don't know what it's like not to be
 
05:31:35.830 --> 05:31:35.840 align:start position:0%
fit enough to actually learn but these
 
05:31:38.628 --> 05:31:38.638 align:start position:0%
kids are not
 
05:31:39.590 --> 05:31:39.600 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:31:41.830 --> 05:31:41.840 align:start position:0%
uh representative mullen
 
05:31:42.788 --> 05:31:42.798 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:31:45.750 --> 05:31:45.760 align:start position:0%
mr chair and thank you dr o'neal i'm not
 
05:31:48.310 --> 05:31:48.320 align:start position:0%
sure uh dr o'neill if you are the person
 
05:31:50.390 --> 05:31:50.400 align:start position:0%
to answer this question
 
05:31:52.708 --> 05:31:52.718 align:start position:0%
but representative woodside and i have
 
05:31:52.718 --> 05:31:53.670 align:start position:0%
but representative woodside and i have
been

05:31:53.670 --> 05:31:53.680 align:start position:0%
been
 
05:31:57.430 --> 05:31:57.440 align:start position:0%
deep in uh yeah
 
05:32:00.390 --> 05:32:00.400 align:start position:0%
have been deep in uh
 
05:32:02.788 --> 05:32:02.798 align:start position:0%
research mode over here
 
05:32:07.830 --> 05:32:07.840 align:start position:0%
trying to find out if in fact there is
 
05:32:11.910 --> 05:32:11.920 align:start position:0%
a minimum time requirement for pe
 
05:32:15.670 --> 05:32:15.680 align:start position:0%
how that compares to art and music
 
05:32:18.708 --> 05:32:18.718 align:start position:0%
and english and math and
 
05:32:20.548 --> 05:32:20.558 align:start position:0%
uh because i feel like when we're
 
05:32:22.390 --> 05:32:22.400 align:start position:0%
looking at this bill and we're looking
 
05:32:26.070 --> 05:32:26.080 align:start position:0%
at 150 minutes a week 255 minutes a week
 
05:32:27.910 --> 05:32:27.920 align:start position:0%
or whatever i
 
05:32:29.990 --> 05:32:30.000 align:start position:0%
i feel like i'm comparing apples and
 
05:32:32.628 --> 05:32:32.638 align:start position:0%
oranges when i'm comparing a specific
 
05:32:35.750 --> 05:32:35.760 align:start position:0%
time to a recommendation so
 
05:32:38.150 --> 05:32:38.160 align:start position:0%
can you comment on that yes and for sure
 
05:32:41.030 --> 05:32:41.040 align:start position:0%
miss savage we'll talk about this but
 
05:32:42.628 --> 05:32:42.638 align:start position:0%
you're not comparing apples or oranges
 
05:32:45.910 --> 05:32:45.920 align:start position:0%
you're comparing a family room to a
 
05:32:49.990 --> 05:32:50.000 align:start position:0%
living room to an eat-in dining room
 
05:32:51.830 --> 05:32:51.840 align:start position:0%
physical education is the foundation
 
05:32:54.150 --> 05:32:54.160 align:start position:0%
that's not optional physical education
 
05:32:56.948 --> 05:32:56.958 align:start position:0%
is the foundation after that now you can
 
05:32:58.868 --> 05:32:58.878 align:start position:0%
talk about the different rooms and how
 
05:33:01.190 --> 05:33:01.200 align:start position:0%
much room goes into english and how much
 
05:33:03.670 --> 05:33:03.680 align:start position:0%
room goes into art the other thing that
 
05:33:05.190 --> 05:33:05.200 align:start position:0%
i that i talk about in the book and by
 
05:33:07.350 --> 05:33:07.360 align:start position:0%
the way almost all of your questions i i
 
05:33:09.110 --> 05:33:09.120 align:start position:0%
believe are answered in the book
 
05:33:11.190 --> 05:33:11.200 align:start position:0%
the other thing is that
 
05:33:13.590 --> 05:33:13.600 align:start position:0%
we're not fighting physical education is
 
05:33:15.510 --> 05:33:15.520 align:start position:0%
not fighting with art and music those
 
05:33:17.750 --> 05:33:17.760 align:start position:0%
things are incredibly important
 
05:33:19.510 --> 05:33:19.520 align:start position:0%
if i'm going to fight with anybody i'm
 
05:33:21.350 --> 05:33:21.360 align:start position:0%
going to fight with math and i'm going
 
05:33:24.150 --> 05:33:24.160 align:start position:0%
to fight with english because again
 
05:33:27.190 --> 05:33:27.200 align:start position:0%
my obese diabetic
 
05:33:30.070 --> 05:33:30.080 align:start position:0%
10 year old is not fit enough to learn
 
05:33:34.868 --> 05:33:34.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:34.878 --> 05:33:36.310 align:start position:0%
 
follow-up

05:33:36.310 --> 05:33:36.320 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
05:33:38.708 --> 05:33:38.718 align:start position:0%
and maybe this follow-up is for you mr
 
05:33:42.070 --> 05:33:42.080 align:start position:0%
chair um is there anyone
 
05:33:45.590 --> 05:33:45.600 align:start position:0%
that can tell me if there is a specific
 
05:33:48.310 --> 05:33:48.320 align:start position:0%
time requirement no
 
05:33:49.990 --> 05:33:50.000 align:start position:0%
you you know what no one can tell me or
 
05:33:52.548 --> 05:33:52.558 align:start position:0%
no there is no there is nothing
 
05:33:54.868 --> 05:33:54.878 align:start position:0%
we'll talk about that but no it is not
 
05:33:56.310 --> 05:33:56.320 align:start position:0%
and this is what happens when you look
 
05:33:58.390 --> 05:33:58.400 align:start position:0%
at the standards in every in in all the
 
05:34:00.788 --> 05:34:00.798 align:start position:0%
states and granted this the new
 
05:34:02.150 --> 05:34:02.160 align:start position:0%
hampshire standards that i talk about in
 
05:34:05.350 --> 05:34:05.360 align:start position:0%
the book are now a few years old they
 
05:34:07.670 --> 05:34:07.680 align:start position:0%
don't they don't touch that they're they
 
05:34:09.750 --> 05:34:09.760 align:start position:0%
they don't touch that illinois touched
 
05:34:12.230 --> 05:34:12.240 align:start position:0%
it and they're fighting now tooth and
 
05:34:14.310 --> 05:34:14.320 align:start position:0%
nail in illinois illinois was the first
 
05:34:16.470 --> 05:34:16.480 align:start position:0%
state to mandate this and it's been a
 
05:34:19.110 --> 05:34:19.120 align:start position:0%
battle but we don't have to lose that
 
05:34:21.110 --> 05:34:21.120 align:start position:0%
battle represent you'd have to go back
 
05:34:23.830 --> 05:34:23.840 align:start position:0%
to the 19 latter part of the 1970s to
 
05:34:25.750 --> 05:34:25.760 align:start position:0%
get what you're looking for yeah yeah
 
05:34:28.390 --> 05:34:28.400 align:start position:0%
and you know and you go to 1866 in
 
05:34:28.400 --> 05:34:29.590 align:start position:0%
and you know and you go to 1866 in
california

05:34:29.590 --> 05:34:29.600 align:start position:0%
california
 
05:34:32.548 --> 05:34:32.558 align:start position:0%
two exercise periods a day in 1866 and
 
05:34:33.670 --> 05:34:33.680 align:start position:0%
you want to talk about kids that were
 
05:34:35.470 --> 05:34:35.480 align:start position:0%
walking up hill right
 
05:34:39.430 --> 05:34:39.440 align:start position:0%
1866 in california two exercise periods
 
05:34:41.190 --> 05:34:41.200 align:start position:0%
a day for every child
 
05:34:43.590 --> 05:34:43.600 align:start position:0%
is that true for uh
 
05:34:45.030 --> 05:34:45.040 align:start position:0%
math and
 
05:34:45.040 --> 05:34:46.150 align:start position:0%
math and
english

05:34:46.150 --> 05:34:46.160 align:start position:0%
english
 
05:34:48.070 --> 05:34:48.080 align:start position:0%
whatever they have very specific time
 
05:34:50.788 --> 05:34:50.798 align:start position:0%
right they have minutes per week
 
05:34:53.190 --> 05:34:53.200 align:start position:0%
and that's what we have to back off on
 
05:34:55.510 --> 05:34:55.520 align:start position:0%
and allow educators
 
05:34:58.788 --> 05:34:58.798 align:start position:0%
that that that uh leeway thank you
 
05:35:01.030 --> 05:35:01.040 align:start position:0%
represent wood woodcock
 
05:35:02.548 --> 05:35:02.558 align:start position:0%
thank you president
 
05:35:04.868 --> 05:35:04.878 align:start position:0%
uh doctor thank you for taking my
 
05:35:08.310 --> 05:35:08.320 align:start position:0%
question um because i hear you speak uh
 
05:35:09.910 --> 05:35:09.920 align:start position:0%
as i said to representative tanner you
 
05:35:11.750 --> 05:35:11.760 align:start position:0%
come from a physical health background
 
05:35:12.948 --> 05:35:12.958 align:start position:0%
actually yesterday after when i was snow
 
05:35:16.310 --> 05:35:16.320 align:start position:0%
showing just keep my dog walk um
 
05:35:17.830 --> 05:35:17.840 align:start position:0%
obviously you've said multiple times
 
05:35:20.548 --> 05:35:20.558 align:start position:0%
that uh fizz ed lifetime fitness becomes
 
05:35:21.670 --> 05:35:21.680 align:start position:0%
a habit
 
05:35:23.430 --> 05:35:23.440 align:start position:0%
and it's foundational to our academic
 
05:35:25.430 --> 05:35:25.440 align:start position:0%
success and our health as we age and it
 
05:35:27.510 --> 05:35:27.520 align:start position:0%
has to be taught as a habit
 
05:35:30.230 --> 05:35:30.240 align:start position:0%
what struck me the most was
 
05:35:32.230 --> 05:35:32.240 align:start position:0%
because i believe what you're saying but
 
05:35:35.190 --> 05:35:35.200 align:start position:0%
what struck me was the progressive idea
 
05:35:37.510 --> 05:35:37.520 align:start position:0%
of not uh and it's not addressed on this
 
05:35:40.230 --> 05:35:40.240 align:start position:0%
bill but rather
 
05:35:43.030 --> 05:35:43.040 align:start position:0%
rather the opportunity to integrate this
 
05:35:46.070 --> 05:35:46.080 align:start position:0%
at grade one and then one two and one
 
05:35:48.070 --> 05:35:48.080 align:start position:0%
two three so we're building this
 
05:35:50.470 --> 05:35:50.480 align:start position:0%
lifetime support uh and to become a
 
05:35:52.070 --> 05:35:52.080 align:start position:0%
habit for me so it'd be just a natural
 
05:35:55.510 --> 05:35:55.520 align:start position:0%
way the second part that that uh
 
05:35:57.510 --> 05:35:57.520 align:start position:0%
intrigued me about that carryover would
 
05:35:59.430 --> 05:35:59.440 align:start position:0%
be a lot easier for school systems to
 
05:36:02.548 --> 05:36:02.558 align:start position:0%
adopt that model as they integrate the
 
05:36:04.548 --> 05:36:04.558 align:start position:0%
cost and the activity and the training
 
05:36:06.708 --> 05:36:06.718 align:start position:0%
for physical educators uh for that
 
05:36:09.030 --> 05:36:09.040 align:start position:0%
program and i would i hope that um
 
05:36:09.910 --> 05:36:09.920 align:start position:0%
representative canaric and
 
05:36:12.230 --> 05:36:12.240 align:start position:0%
representative tiana may be amenable to
 
05:36:13.750 --> 05:36:13.760 align:start position:0%
thinking about an amendment that would
 
05:36:16.070 --> 05:36:16.080 align:start position:0%
allow these time frames and and great
 
05:36:18.628 --> 05:36:18.638 align:start position:0%
frames integrated in a progressive way
 
05:36:20.868 --> 05:36:20.878 align:start position:0%
so it's not a big huge human cry at one
 
05:36:21.830 --> 05:36:21.840 align:start position:0%
time and
 
05:36:23.350 --> 05:36:23.360 align:start position:0%
and i just want to thank you for
 
05:36:25.350 --> 05:36:25.360 align:start position:0%
bringing this forward with such passion
 
05:36:26.470 --> 05:36:26.480 align:start position:0%
i couldn't agree more thank you
 
05:36:28.390 --> 05:36:28.400 align:start position:0%
representative representative you had a
 
05:36:28.400 --> 05:36:29.350 align:start position:0%
representative representative you had a
question

05:36:29.350 --> 05:36:29.360 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:36:31.430 --> 05:36:31.440 align:start position:0%
yes thank you when i brought up that
 
05:36:33.990 --> 05:36:34.000 align:start position:0%
when i went to high school it was 45
 
05:36:35.750 --> 05:36:35.760 align:start position:0%
minutes a day every day of the week for
 
05:36:37.990 --> 05:36:38.000 align:start position:0%
four years but that was in miami and we
 
05:36:40.548 --> 05:36:40.558 align:start position:0%
had outdoors and whatnot the problem is
 
05:36:42.470 --> 05:36:42.480 align:start position:0%
now we have space problems in schools
 
05:36:44.868 --> 05:36:44.878 align:start position:0%
where the gym in some schools isn't just
 
05:36:45.830 --> 05:36:45.840 align:start position:0%
the gym
 
05:36:48.390 --> 05:36:48.400 align:start position:0%
so that's a big issue the one issue
 
05:36:50.150 --> 05:36:50.160 align:start position:0%
though too is what i brought up before
 
05:36:52.310 --> 05:36:52.320 align:start position:0%
is alternative education
 
05:36:54.708 --> 05:36:54.718 align:start position:0%
so if a student take for example is
 
05:36:56.628 --> 05:36:56.638 align:start position:0%
doing gymnastics which is two to three
 
05:36:58.948 --> 05:36:58.958 align:start position:0%
hours a night three or four days a week
 
05:37:00.788 --> 05:37:00.798 align:start position:0%
all year
 
05:37:02.310 --> 05:37:02.320 align:start position:0%
don't you think that would be an
 
05:37:02.320 --> 05:37:03.750 align:start position:0%
don't you think that would be an
alternative

05:37:03.750 --> 05:37:03.760 align:start position:0%
alternative
 
05:37:06.470 --> 05:37:06.480 align:start position:0%
rather than taking the phys ed in school
 
05:37:08.390 --> 05:37:08.400 align:start position:0%
well you're asking the wrong guy here
 
05:37:09.830 --> 05:37:09.840 align:start position:0%
representative because i'm a sports
 
05:37:12.628 --> 05:37:12.638 align:start position:0%
medicine doctor in my day job
 
05:37:12.638 --> 05:37:13.750 align:start position:0%
medicine doctor in my day job
and

05:37:13.750 --> 05:37:13.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:37:16.310 --> 05:37:16.320 align:start position:0%
i deal with athletes and i can tell you
 
05:37:18.070 --> 05:37:18.080 align:start position:0%
after having been the doctor at burke
 
05:37:20.628 --> 05:37:20.638 align:start position:0%
mountain ski academy for many years
 
05:37:23.910 --> 05:37:23.920 align:start position:0%
they are getting ski racers in 2022 that
 
05:37:25.190 --> 05:37:25.200 align:start position:0%
are not fit
 
05:37:27.190 --> 05:37:27.200 align:start position:0%
these are the top skiers in the country
 
05:37:29.670 --> 05:37:29.680 align:start position:0%
top youth skiers in the country they
 
05:37:32.070 --> 05:37:32.080 align:start position:0%
don't have the general all-around skills
 
05:37:34.310 --> 05:37:34.320 align:start position:0%
that a bodhi miller had from running
 
05:37:37.110 --> 05:37:37.120 align:start position:0%
around the woods of franconia for years
 
05:37:39.510 --> 05:37:39.520 align:start position:0%
and so what we're seeing at these these
 
05:37:41.910 --> 05:37:41.920 align:start position:0%
students that specialize in sports is
 
05:37:43.750 --> 05:37:43.760 align:start position:0%
that they don't have the overall skills
 
05:37:45.190 --> 05:37:45.200 align:start position:0%
and again miss savage could speak to
 
05:37:45.200 --> 05:37:45.990 align:start position:0%
and again miss savage could speak to
that

05:37:45.990 --> 05:37:46.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:37:46.000 --> 05:37:46.948 align:start position:0%
that
uh

05:37:46.948 --> 05:37:46.958 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:37:49.030 --> 05:37:49.040 align:start position:0%
for the next eight hours yeah which is
 
05:37:50.708 --> 05:37:50.718 align:start position:0%
different than somebody doing gymnastics
 
05:37:55.270 --> 05:37:55.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:56.948 --> 05:37:56.958 align:start position:0%
but the other important point again is
 
05:37:58.310 --> 05:37:58.320 align:start position:0%
that your granddaughter is developing
 
05:38:00.070 --> 05:38:00.080 align:start position:0%
your physical identity and that's at the
 
05:38:02.310 --> 05:38:02.320 align:start position:0%
end of the day really what i care about
 
05:38:05.590 --> 05:38:05.600 align:start position:0%
are there any further questions
 
05:38:07.750 --> 05:38:07.760 align:start position:0%
yes representative moffat
 
05:38:09.190 --> 05:38:09.200 align:start position:0%
thank you mr thank you dr o'neill for
 
05:38:11.110 --> 05:38:11.120 align:start position:0%
being here and i know plymouth state
 
05:38:12.868 --> 05:38:12.878 align:start position:0%
used to have a pe requirement that
 
05:38:14.230 --> 05:38:14.240 align:start position:0%
they've done away with which i was
 
05:38:15.670 --> 05:38:15.680 align:start position:0%
disappointed anyway
 
05:38:18.230 --> 05:38:18.240 align:start position:0%
um and this may not be a fair question
 
05:38:20.310 --> 05:38:20.320 align:start position:0%
to you but the wheels are turning
 
05:38:22.070 --> 05:38:22.080 align:start position:0%
and you just mentioned the obese 10 year
 
05:38:24.390 --> 05:38:24.400 align:start position:0%
old and dr knurk had talked at these
 
05:38:26.788 --> 05:38:26.798 align:start position:0%
statistics about 20 meeting criteria for
 
05:38:26.798 --> 05:38:28.070 align:start position:0%
statistics about 20 meeting criteria for
obesity

05:38:28.070 --> 05:38:28.080 align:start position:0%
obesity
 
05:38:30.390 --> 05:38:30.400 align:start position:0%
my question has to do with
 
05:38:33.910 --> 05:38:33.920 align:start position:0%
uh do we need to have every single
 
05:38:33.920 --> 05:38:35.190 align:start position:0%
uh do we need to have every single
student

05:38:35.190 --> 05:38:35.200 align:start position:0%
student
 
05:38:37.750 --> 05:38:37.760 align:start position:0%
i know we'd like to uh have for social
 
05:38:39.190 --> 05:38:39.200 align:start position:0%
reasons and
 
05:38:41.270 --> 05:38:41.280 align:start position:0%
but if the focus from what i'm hearing
 
05:38:43.910 --> 05:38:43.920 align:start position:0%
from dr connorick and from you and and
 
05:38:45.990 --> 05:38:46.000 align:start position:0%
representative tanner if the focus of
 
05:38:47.670 --> 05:38:47.680 align:start position:0%
these people who as representative
 
05:38:51.270 --> 05:38:51.280 align:start position:0%
tanner said or their lives were at risk
 
05:38:53.670 --> 05:38:53.680 align:start position:0%
why is there some way that we could have
 
05:38:55.750 --> 05:38:55.760 align:start position:0%
an assessment that included aerobic
 
05:38:58.070 --> 05:38:58.080 align:start position:0%
proficiency upper body strength body
 
05:38:58.080 --> 05:38:58.868 align:start position:0%
proficiency upper body strength body
mass

05:38:58.868 --> 05:38:58.878 align:start position:0%
mass
 
05:39:01.990 --> 05:39:02.000 align:start position:0%
index so if if somebody's really fit and
 
05:39:03.110 --> 05:39:03.120 align:start position:0%
they know the standards that are
 
05:39:05.510 --> 05:39:05.520 align:start position:0%
accepted they can proficiency out of
 
05:39:08.708 --> 05:39:08.718 align:start position:0%
this and and my thinking is that if
 
05:39:10.390 --> 05:39:10.400 align:start position:0%
as representative tanner said people
 
05:39:11.670 --> 05:39:11.680 align:start position:0%
didn't want to take pe so they weren't
 
05:39:13.750 --> 05:39:13.760 align:start position:0%
for tennis if somebody knew that if they
 
05:39:15.350 --> 05:39:15.360 align:start position:0%
could run a certain
 
05:39:17.110 --> 05:39:17.120 align:start position:0%
speed they didn't have to take pe i
 
05:39:18.948 --> 05:39:18.958 align:start position:0%
think on their own some of these people
 
05:39:21.270 --> 05:39:21.280 align:start position:0%
get fit outside of school but you see my
 
05:39:22.470 --> 05:39:22.480 align:start position:0%
question can
 
05:39:24.390 --> 05:39:24.400 align:start position:0%
why can't we just focus on the ones that
 
05:39:27.270 --> 05:39:27.280 align:start position:0%
are really at risk instead of everybody
 
05:39:29.590 --> 05:39:29.600 align:start position:0%
well a couple of reasons number one as
 
05:39:31.350 --> 05:39:31.360 align:start position:0%
you say logistically it'd be very
 
05:39:33.430 --> 05:39:33.440 align:start position:0%
difficult and then parents were trying
 
05:39:35.190 --> 05:39:35.200 align:start position:0%
to figure out ways for their unfit kid
 
05:39:37.510 --> 05:39:37.520 align:start position:0%
to get out of it and number two
 
05:39:40.628 --> 05:39:40.638 align:start position:0%
you are revving up your brain so before
 
05:39:43.750 --> 05:39:43.760 align:start position:0%
i sit for my board exam or before i
 
05:39:46.150 --> 05:39:46.160 align:start position:0%
do an operation before i do anything the
 
05:39:47.830 --> 05:39:47.840 align:start position:0%
best thing i can do is go out and go for
 
05:39:50.390 --> 05:39:50.400 align:start position:0%
a good stiff walk or do some push-ups or
 
05:39:52.628 --> 05:39:52.638 align:start position:0%
get my body going get my heart rate
 
05:39:55.030 --> 05:39:55.040 align:start position:0%
going and get my brain going so
 
05:39:57.350 --> 05:39:57.360 align:start position:0%
the fittest kid you know the fittest
 
05:39:59.270 --> 05:39:59.280 align:start position:0%
olympic athlete is still going to
 
05:40:01.030 --> 05:40:01.040 align:start position:0%
benefit before they take that test
 
05:40:03.270 --> 05:40:03.280 align:start position:0%
before they uh sit in that calculus
 
05:40:05.990 --> 05:40:06.000 align:start position:0%
class from getting their uh heart rate
 
05:40:09.190 --> 05:40:09.200 align:start position:0%
up and getting getting some movement
 
05:40:10.310 --> 05:40:10.320 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:40:12.830 --> 05:40:12.840 align:start position:0%
are there further questions
 
05:40:15.030 --> 05:40:15.040 align:start position:0%
not represent ford do you have a
 
05:40:17.110 --> 05:40:17.120 align:start position:0%
question your your your lights on your
 
05:40:18.150 --> 05:40:18.160 align:start position:0%
lights on
 
05:40:19.830 --> 05:40:19.840 align:start position:0%
oh no no
 
05:40:21.670 --> 05:40:21.680 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you all thank
 
05:40:21.680 --> 05:40:26.948 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you all thank
you

05:40:26.948 --> 05:40:26.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:31.910 --> 05:40:31.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:33.190 --> 05:40:33.200 align:start position:0%
you have to go now
 
05:40:33.200 --> 05:40:34.548 align:start position:0%
you have to go now

my name is liz savage and i am a
 
05:40:48.310 --> 05:40:48.320 align:start position:0%
passionate pe teacher for grades 7
 
05:40:50.628 --> 05:40:50.638 align:start position:0%
through 12 at interlakes middle high
 
05:40:52.548 --> 05:40:52.558 align:start position:0%
school in meredith i received my
 
05:40:53.910 --> 05:40:53.920 align:start position:0%
teaching degree from plymouth state in
 
05:40:56.070 --> 05:40:56.080 align:start position:0%
96 and i've been at my current school
 
05:40:58.548 --> 05:40:58.558 align:start position:0%
for 13 years and like dr o'neill i've
 
05:41:00.150 --> 05:41:00.160 align:start position:0%
had a front row seat watching the
 
05:41:02.548 --> 05:41:02.558 align:start position:0%
deterioration of children's health
 
05:41:04.310 --> 05:41:04.320 align:start position:0%
a big percentage of children between the
 
05:41:06.470 --> 05:41:06.480 align:start position:0%
ages of 12 and 18 that i work with have
 
05:41:09.430 --> 05:41:09.440 align:start position:0%
no physicality they cannot squat they
 
05:41:10.470 --> 05:41:10.480 align:start position:0%
cannot run
 
05:41:12.230 --> 05:41:12.240 align:start position:0%
they simply cannot move like young
 
05:41:14.150 --> 05:41:14.160 align:start position:0%
athletic beings that they should be at
 
05:41:15.430 --> 05:41:15.440 align:start position:0%
this age
 
05:41:17.590 --> 05:41:17.600 align:start position:0%
one major problem is time i see high
 
05:41:19.750 --> 05:41:19.760 align:start position:0%
school students for two quarters which
 
05:41:22.150 --> 05:41:22.160 align:start position:0%
equals half a school year this is two
 
05:41:24.230 --> 05:41:24.240 align:start position:0%
quarters out of the 16 that they are
 
05:41:26.470 --> 05:41:26.480 align:start position:0%
enrolled in our four-year high school
 
05:41:27.910 --> 05:41:27.920 align:start position:0%
middle school students they come every
 
05:41:30.708 --> 05:41:30.718 align:start position:0%
other day for almost 25 to 30 minutes
 
05:41:32.548 --> 05:41:32.558 align:start position:0%
this is extremely short compared to the
 
05:41:34.548 --> 05:41:34.558 align:start position:0%
likes of english language arts social
 
05:41:37.750 --> 05:41:37.760 align:start position:0%
studies science and math
 
05:41:39.750 --> 05:41:39.760 align:start position:0%
this is a far cry from the 45 minutes of
 
05:41:41.910 --> 05:41:41.920 align:start position:0%
moderate to vigorous physical activity
 
05:41:43.750 --> 05:41:43.760 align:start position:0%
that is recommended daily
 
05:41:45.670 --> 05:41:45.680 align:start position:0%
knowing there is limited limited time my
 
05:41:47.110 --> 05:41:47.120 align:start position:0%
goal is to have the students move the
 
05:41:49.270 --> 05:41:49.280 align:start position:0%
second they cross the threshold
 
05:41:51.350 --> 05:41:51.360 align:start position:0%
any day we get outside is a good day but
 
05:41:53.030 --> 05:41:53.040 align:start position:0%
this is still not enough with this
 
05:41:55.430 --> 05:41:55.440 align:start position:0%
limited time not only are we not having
 
05:41:57.110 --> 05:41:57.120 align:start position:0%
an effect of their on their physical
 
05:41:59.270 --> 05:41:59.280 align:start position:0%
fitness we are not turning on their
 
05:42:01.750 --> 05:42:01.760 align:start position:0%
brains for work in the classroom
 
05:42:03.670 --> 05:42:03.680 align:start position:0%
every pe teacher has the education to
 
05:42:05.670 --> 05:42:05.680 align:start position:0%
make things happen for our students we
 
05:42:07.190 --> 05:42:07.200 align:start position:0%
just need the time
 
05:42:09.110 --> 05:42:09.120 align:start position:0%
dr o'neill likes to call the pe teacher
 
05:42:11.670 --> 05:42:11.680 align:start position:0%
the first violin of the school orchestra
 
05:42:13.670 --> 05:42:13.680 align:start position:0%
without a strong body there will be no
 
05:42:16.070 --> 05:42:16.080 align:start position:0%
strong minds our private schools have
 
05:42:17.990 --> 05:42:18.000 align:start position:0%
appreciated this and why should our
 
05:42:19.750 --> 05:42:19.760 align:start position:0%
public schools
 
05:42:21.670 --> 05:42:21.680 align:start position:0%
receive any less
 
05:42:23.910 --> 05:42:23.920 align:start position:0%
we also need to distinguish between
 
05:42:26.708 --> 05:42:26.718 align:start position:0%
sports and pe they are not the same pe
 
05:42:28.628 --> 05:42:28.638 align:start position:0%
and active outdoor play gives kids the
 
05:42:30.548 --> 05:42:30.558 align:start position:0%
fitness to play sports
 
05:42:32.548 --> 05:42:32.558 align:start position:0%
it is the rare school where even 50
 
05:42:34.150 --> 05:42:34.160 align:start position:0%
percent of students are playing
 
05:42:36.628 --> 05:42:36.638 align:start position:0%
organized sports that means a majority
 
05:42:38.310 --> 05:42:38.320 align:start position:0%
of our kids are falling behind not only
 
05:42:40.868 --> 05:42:40.878 align:start position:0%
in fitness but academic achievement
 
05:42:43.270 --> 05:42:43.280 align:start position:0%
we cannot allow a two-tier system of
 
05:42:44.708 --> 05:42:44.718 align:start position:0%
have and have-nots
 
05:42:46.548 --> 05:42:46.558 align:start position:0%
all children deserve a basic level of
 
05:42:48.628 --> 05:42:48.638 align:start position:0%
health and by maintaining physical
 
05:42:51.270 --> 05:42:51.280 align:start position:0%
identity we can give that to them
 
05:42:53.030 --> 05:42:53.040 align:start position:0%
ideally my job is to help graduate
 
05:42:54.788 --> 05:42:54.798 align:start position:0%
students to the next level with the
 
05:42:57.270 --> 05:42:57.280 align:start position:0%
tools needed for a healthy life
 
05:42:59.430 --> 05:42:59.440 align:start position:0%
my job is to remind kids what is already
 
05:43:01.510 --> 05:43:01.520 align:start position:0%
in their dna that playing and especially
 
05:43:03.350 --> 05:43:03.360 align:start position:0%
playing outside is fun
 
05:43:05.670 --> 05:43:05.680 align:start position:0%
and in fact a lot more fun than another
 
05:43:07.670 --> 05:43:07.680 align:start position:0%
hour in front of a video game
 
05:43:09.990 --> 05:43:10.000 align:start position:0%
30 to 45 minutes a day of increased
 
05:43:12.070 --> 05:43:12.080 align:start position:0%
heart rate for every child every day is
 
05:43:14.310 --> 05:43:14.320 align:start position:0%
going to burn hundreds of calories
 
05:43:17.510 --> 05:43:17.520 align:start position:0%
and as alluded to help maintains
 
05:43:19.750 --> 05:43:19.760 align:start position:0%
children's physical identity
 
05:43:21.510 --> 05:43:21.520 align:start position:0%
i have a 12 year old and my husband and
 
05:43:22.470 --> 05:43:22.480 align:start position:0%
i limit
 
05:43:24.150 --> 05:43:24.160 align:start position:0%
the screen time as well as processed
 
05:43:26.070 --> 05:43:26.080 align:start position:0%
food as well as making sure he gets
 
05:43:27.910 --> 05:43:27.920 align:start position:0%
plenty of time outdoors
 
05:43:29.670 --> 05:43:29.680 align:start position:0%
but as parents we are fighting a battle
 
05:43:32.230 --> 05:43:32.240 align:start position:0%
against true forces of evil the folks in
 
05:43:33.910 --> 05:43:33.920 align:start position:0%
silicon valley made the old addiction
 
05:43:35.590 --> 05:43:35.600 align:start position:0%
companies of big tobacco look like
 
05:43:38.390 --> 05:43:38.400 align:start position:0%
amateurs every child in 2022 is
 
05:43:40.628 --> 05:43:40.638 align:start position:0%
continually being exposed to the these
 
05:43:42.470 --> 05:43:42.480 align:start position:0%
addictive devices
 
05:43:44.310 --> 05:43:44.320 align:start position:0%
and these forces are constantly looking
 
05:43:46.390 --> 05:43:46.400 align:start position:0%
for ways to get our children to make one
 
05:43:48.548 --> 05:43:48.558 align:start position:0%
more click and keep them from being the
 
05:43:51.830 --> 05:43:51.840 align:start position:0%
active people that they should be
 
05:43:53.670 --> 05:43:53.680 align:start position:0%
thanks so much for your consideration
 
05:43:55.990 --> 05:43:56.000 align:start position:0%

about much about these things myself
 
05:46:22.708 --> 05:46:22.718 align:start position:0%
why do we inject this poison into the
 
05:46:23.910 --> 05:46:23.920 align:start position:0%
kid's mind
 
05:46:26.150 --> 05:46:26.160 align:start position:0%
at such a young age
 
05:46:28.310 --> 05:46:28.320 align:start position:0%
we're talking about physical
 
05:46:30.070 --> 05:46:30.080 align:start position:0%
exercise and stuff like that for kids is
 
05:46:30.080 --> 05:46:31.430 align:start position:0%

good

05:46:31.430 --> 05:46:31.440 align:start position:0%
good
 
05:46:34.708 --> 05:46:34.718 align:start position:0%
but this is not all in the this bill
 
05:46:36.548 --> 05:46:36.558 align:start position:0%
it's have all kinds of crazy stuff in
 
05:46:36.558 --> 05:46:38.310 align:start position:0%
it's have all kinds of crazy stuff in
here

05:46:38.310 --> 05:46:38.320 align:start position:0%
here
 
05:46:40.628 --> 05:46:40.638 align:start position:0%
this bill is totally about physical
 
05:46:42.548 --> 05:46:42.558 align:start position:0%
education all the other language you see
 
05:46:45.030 --> 05:46:45.040 align:start position:0%
there that's not in bold print is in law
 
05:46:50.070 --> 05:46:50.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:50.080 --> 05:46:51.270 align:start position:0%
 
okay

05:46:51.270 --> 05:46:51.280 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:46:53.990 --> 05:46:54.000 align:start position:0%

public
 
05:46:58.230 --> 05:46:58.240 align:start position:0%
is safe and fine for the kids but i
 
05:47:00.548 --> 05:47:00.558 align:start position:0%
oppose this bill because
 
05:47:02.310 --> 05:47:02.320 align:start position:0%
with all these
 
05:47:05.750 --> 05:47:05.760 align:start position:0%
like introducing like um prevention for
 
05:47:08.070 --> 05:47:08.080 align:start position:0%
like birth control for the kids then we
 
05:47:09.830 --> 05:47:09.840 align:start position:0%

05:47:11.990 --> 05:47:12.000 align:start position:0%
which uh children teenagers having

abortion and now we're introducing a lot
 
05:47:16.240 --> 05:47:17.190 align:start position:0%
abortion and now we're introducing a lot
of

05:47:17.190 --> 05:47:17.200 align:start position:0%
of
 
05:47:19.110 --> 05:47:19.120 align:start position:0%
these um
 
05:47:20.390 --> 05:47:20.400 align:start position:0%

school
 
05:47:26.708 --> 05:47:26.718 align:start position:0%
this will lead to bigger problems for us
 
05:47:29.270 --> 05:47:29.280 align:start position:0%
to deal with in the future so i would
 
05:47:31.510 --> 05:47:31.520 align:start position:0%
like to if you could please oppose this
 
05:47:33.110 --> 05:47:33.120 align:start position:0%

is the accommodation piece yep that's
right

right
 
05:57:26.548 --> 05:57:26.558 align:start position:0%
easy peasy so
 
05:57:28.150 --> 05:57:28.160 align:start position:0%
okay because i was reading i i was
 
05:57:30.708 --> 05:57:30.718 align:start position:0%
reading it incorrectly uh because i'm
 
05:57:32.470 --> 05:57:32.480 align:start position:0%
looking at the first part but you're
 
05:57:34.548 --> 05:57:34.558 align:start position:0%
you're telling me that lines two three
 
05:57:37.190 --> 05:57:37.200 align:start position:0%
and four that's already in law
 
05:57:39.350 --> 05:57:39.360 align:start position:0%
well i don't have a copy of the
 
05:57:41.750 --> 05:57:41.760 align:start position:0%
legislation with the lines in it uh that
 
05:57:43.590 --> 05:57:43.600 align:start position:0%
reference the line right it's talking
 
05:57:45.910 --> 05:57:45.920 align:start position:0%
about a requirement for local competency
 
05:57:45.920 --> 05:57:46.948 align:start position:0%
about a requirement for local competency
assessment

05:57:46.948 --> 05:57:46.958 align:start position:0%
assessment
 
05:57:48.548 --> 05:57:48.558 align:start position:0%
the us government and then outlines the
 
05:57:51.030 --> 05:57:51.040 align:start position:0%
multiple pieces of that yep
 
05:57:52.708 --> 05:57:52.718 align:start position:0%
as one
 
05:57:55.350 --> 05:57:55.360 align:start position:0%
and then two it outlines the
 
05:57:57.990 --> 05:57:58.000 align:start position:0%
the non-assessment
 
05:58:00.628 --> 05:58:00.638 align:start position:0%
uh the non-training
 
05:58:02.390 --> 05:58:02.400 align:start position:0%
testing examination that we give kids to
 
05:58:04.788 --> 05:58:04.798 align:start position:0%
get a graduation diploma which is the
 
05:58:07.270 --> 05:58:07.280 align:start position:0%
immigration exam which is different from
 
05:58:08.948 --> 05:58:08.958 align:start position:0%
your part a
 
05:58:10.470 --> 05:58:10.480 align:start position:0%
so you're telling me the part the part
 
05:58:12.470 --> 05:58:12.480 align:start position:0%
that began in the assessment of
 
05:58:12.480 --> 05:58:13.750 align:start position:0%
that began in the assessment of
uh

05:58:13.750 --> 05:58:13.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:58:16.628 --> 05:58:16.638 align:start position:0%
government and civics is already in law
 
05:58:19.110 --> 05:58:19.120 align:start position:0%
yes exactly
 
05:58:21.590 --> 05:58:21.600 align:start position:0%
well i believe it is um
 
05:58:24.310 --> 05:58:24.320 align:start position:0%
what we were changing was or
 
05:58:26.548 --> 05:58:26.558 align:start position:0%
amending was just
 
05:58:28.310 --> 05:58:28.320 align:start position:0%
the provision for
 
05:58:30.390 --> 05:58:30.400 align:start position:0%
teachers to accommodate individual
 
05:58:32.310 --> 05:58:32.320 align:start position:0%
education plans
 
05:58:42.628 --> 05:58:42.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:44.230 --> 05:58:44.240 align:start position:0%
are you do you still have a question on
 
05:58:45.990 --> 05:58:46.000 align:start position:0%

answering it or were you both thinking
 
05:58:48.948 --> 05:58:48.958 align:start position:0%
yeah i'm trying to decide if i was
 
05:58:50.708 --> 05:58:50.718 align:start position:0%
answering we're both thinking on that
 
05:58:52.628 --> 05:58:52.638 align:start position:0%
question because it's not clear
 
05:58:54.948 --> 05:58:54.958 align:start position:0%
thank you let me ask um
 
05:58:58.868 --> 05:58:58.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:58.878 --> 05:58:59.590 align:start position:0%
 
so

05:58:59.590 --> 05:58:59.600 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:59:02.548 --> 05:59:02.558 align:start position:0%
so representative before you uh

ask of reps and hobson i'm following up
 
05:59:07.990 --> 05:59:08.000 align:start position:0%
to represent woodcock i'm just trying to
 
05:59:10.628 --> 05:59:10.638 align:start position:0%
find out everything that's bold in here
 
05:59:13.990 --> 05:59:14.000 align:start position:0%
is a change to this bill is that correct
 
05:59:16.708 --> 05:59:16.718 align:start position:0%
so now
 
05:59:19.510 --> 05:59:19.520 align:start position:0%
okay in there there's like a both and an
 
05:59:21.750 --> 05:59:21.760 align:start position:0%
and down there as well that's part of
 
05:59:21.760 --> 05:59:23.270 align:start position:0%
and down there as well that's part of
this

05:59:23.270 --> 05:59:23.280 align:start position:0%
this
 
05:59:27.270 --> 05:59:27.280 align:start position:0%
okay then uh could you explain either mr
 
05:59:30.868 --> 05:59:30.878 align:start position:0%
green or or represent hobbs and
 
05:59:34.390 --> 05:59:34.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:36.390 --> 05:59:36.400 align:start position:0%
sure absolutely
 
05:59:37.990 --> 05:59:38.000 align:start position:0%
uh so for the record my name is nate
 
05:59:39.350 --> 05:59:39.360 align:start position:0%
green i'm with the new hampshire
 
05:59:41.750 --> 05:59:41.760 align:start position:0%
department of education uh there are two
 
05:59:43.670 --> 05:59:43.680 align:start position:0%
changes uh that you see here as you
 
05:59:45.990 --> 05:59:46.000 align:start position:0%
mentioned those changes are in bold
 
05:59:48.070 --> 05:59:48.080 align:start position:0%
one is the addition of schools required
 
05:59:50.150 --> 05:59:50.160 align:start position:0%
to provide accommodations accommodations
 
05:59:52.470 --> 05:59:52.480 align:start position:0%
a specific language within the special
 
05:59:54.390 --> 05:59:54.400 align:start position:0%
education program of schools so we
 
05:59:55.350 --> 05:59:55.360 align:start position:0%
wanted to make sure that that was
 
05:59:57.990 --> 05:59:58.000 align:start position:0%
included for students who have ieps that
 
06:00:00.788 --> 06:00:00.798 align:start position:0%
will be required to take this exam
 
06:00:01.750 --> 06:00:01.760 align:start position:0%
and then
 
06:00:03.990 --> 06:00:04.000 align:start position:0%
previously schools were already required
 
06:00:06.548 --> 06:00:06.558 align:start position:0%
to administer a locally designed
 
06:00:09.190 --> 06:00:09.200 align:start position:0%
competency-based assessment the law had
 
06:00:10.948 --> 06:00:10.958 align:start position:0%
added in addition to that a requirement
 
06:00:14.628 --> 06:00:14.638 align:start position:0%
that schools administer the uscis
 
06:00:17.110 --> 06:00:17.120 align:start position:0%
citizenship examination
 
06:00:17.120 --> 06:00:18.788 align:start position:0%
citizenship examination
and

06:00:18.788 --> 06:00:18.798 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:00:20.310 --> 06:00:20.320 align:start position:0%
because schools were required to do both
 
06:00:22.230 --> 06:00:22.240 align:start position:0%
of those things but the language at the
 
06:00:23.510 --> 06:00:23.520 align:start position:0%
end of the bill said that they could
 
06:00:25.830 --> 06:00:25.840 align:start position:0%
submit one or the other of those pieces
 
06:00:27.990 --> 06:00:28.000 align:start position:0%
of data to the department the department
 
06:00:29.750 --> 06:00:29.760 align:start position:0%
felt that because both were requirement
 
06:00:31.110 --> 06:00:31.120 align:start position:0%
it was important to have the sets of
 
06:00:33.190 --> 06:00:33.200 align:start position:0%
data for both of those and that's why
 
06:00:35.430 --> 06:00:35.440 align:start position:0%
the addition of the both and as opposed
 
06:00:37.590 --> 06:00:37.600 align:start position:0%
to the either or was added to the
 
06:00:39.910 --> 06:00:39.920 align:start position:0%
legislation so the requirement to
 
06:00:41.990 --> 06:00:42.000 align:start position:0%
administer the exams are already part of
 
06:00:42.000 --> 06:00:43.030 align:start position:0%
administer the exams are already part of
law

06:00:43.030 --> 06:00:43.040 align:start position:0%
law
 
06:00:45.190 --> 06:00:45.200 align:start position:0%
but it wasn't clear what the department
 
06:00:46.390 --> 06:00:46.400 align:start position:0%
was collecting
 
06:00:47.910 --> 06:00:47.920 align:start position:0%
and so we could have had a situation
 
06:00:49.510 --> 06:00:49.520 align:start position:0%
where half the schools in the state gave
 
06:00:51.830 --> 06:00:51.840 align:start position:0%
us data from the citizenship test and
 
06:00:53.750 --> 06:00:53.760 align:start position:0%
half the schools gave us data from the
 
06:00:56.310 --> 06:00:56.320 align:start position:0%
local competency assessment despite the
 
06:00:58.310 --> 06:00:58.320 align:start position:0%
fact that they're required to do both
 
06:00:59.670 --> 06:00:59.680 align:start position:0%
and we felt if they're required to do
 
06:01:01.430 --> 06:01:01.440 align:start position:0%
both and we're collecting data then we
 
06:01:02.868 --> 06:01:02.878 align:start position:0%
should have the and in there that it was
 
06:01:04.230 --> 06:01:04.240 align:start position:0%
important to have the data from both
 
06:01:07.110 --> 06:01:07.120 align:start position:0%
sets of exams
 
06:01:09.190 --> 06:01:09.200 align:start position:0%
thank you representative woodcock thank
 
06:01:10.868 --> 06:01:10.878 align:start position:0%
you chairman thank you so much that that
 
06:01:12.548 --> 06:01:12.558 align:start position:0%
does clarify the two i knew there were
 
06:01:14.868 --> 06:01:14.878 align:start position:0%
two there if i could just ask one follow
 
06:01:19.990 --> 06:01:20.000 align:start position:0%
up on that regard thank you all that um
 
06:01:22.548 --> 06:01:22.558 align:start position:0%
and the part nate of top that's already
 
06:01:24.788 --> 06:01:24.798 align:start position:0%
in law it talks about the local
 
06:01:24.798 --> 06:01:26.390 align:start position:0%
in law it talks about the local
assessment

06:01:26.390 --> 06:01:26.400 align:start position:0%
assessment
 
06:01:28.470 --> 06:01:28.480 align:start position:0%
is there any numeric number
 
06:01:31.030 --> 06:01:31.040 align:start position:0%
that is required or grade
 
06:01:31.040 --> 06:01:31.990 align:start position:0%
that is required or grade
uh

06:01:31.990 --> 06:01:32.000 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:01:35.190 --> 06:01:35.200 align:start position:0%
alpha uh letter grade required for the
 
06:01:37.670 --> 06:01:37.680 align:start position:0%
local assessment to be considered or is
 
06:01:39.830 --> 06:01:39.840 align:start position:0%
it p or f
 
06:01:45.590 --> 06:01:45.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:47.670 --> 06:01:47.680 align:start position:0%
yeah so this there there's a requirement
 
06:01:50.470 --> 06:01:50.480 align:start position:0%
of 70 on the civics test but on the
 
06:01:53.670 --> 06:01:53.680 align:start position:0%
local competency based examination there
 
06:01:55.670 --> 06:01:55.680 align:start position:0%
was not a certain percentage requirement
 
06:01:57.190 --> 06:01:57.200 align:start position:0%
because there's a variety of different
 
06:01:58.868 --> 06:01:58.878 align:start position:0%
ways that schools
 
06:02:01.990 --> 06:02:02.000 align:start position:0%
can measure that assessment
 
06:02:03.910 --> 06:02:03.920 align:start position:0%
okay thank you thanks my question
 
06:02:09.430 --> 06:02:09.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:11.590 --> 06:02:11.600 align:start position:0%
uh represent you
 
06:02:13.750 --> 06:02:13.760 align:start position:0%
representative can you put the mic on
 
06:02:13.760 --> 06:02:17.190 align:start position:0%
representative can you put the mic on
please

06:02:17.190 --> 06:02:17.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:18.868 --> 06:02:18.878 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
06:02:21.830 --> 06:02:21.840 align:start position:0%
with a simple pass fail grade suffice so
 
06:02:24.230 --> 06:02:24.240 align:start position:0%
they don't have to have a numeric grade
 
06:02:26.230 --> 06:02:26.240 align:start position:0%
it would and in fact that's what we've
 
06:02:28.150 --> 06:02:28.160 align:start position:0%
done this past year because there was a
 
06:02:29.830 --> 06:02:29.840 align:start position:0%
variety of different ways schools could
 
06:02:32.070 --> 06:02:32.080 align:start position:0%
grade the assessments it wouldn't be we
 
06:02:34.150 --> 06:02:34.160 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be able to compare students if
 
06:02:36.470 --> 06:02:36.480 align:start position:0%
one student had an abcd one student had
 
06:02:38.390 --> 06:02:38.400 align:start position:0%
a level one two three four
 
06:02:40.470 --> 06:02:40.480 align:start position:0%
one student had a pass fail so what we
 
06:02:42.548 --> 06:02:42.558 align:start position:0%
asked each school to do is just provide
 
06:02:44.230 --> 06:02:44.240 align:start position:0%
the department with data on which
 
06:02:46.390 --> 06:02:46.400 align:start position:0%
students were proficient on the exam and
 
06:02:48.628 --> 06:02:48.638 align:start position:0%
which students were not proficient so it
 
06:02:50.628 --> 06:02:50.638 align:start position:0%
was it was really just two choices and
 
06:02:52.788 --> 06:02:52.798 align:start position:0%
that's the data we collected thank you
 
06:02:57.750 --> 06:02:57.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:59.270 --> 06:02:59.280 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
06:03:00.708 --> 06:03:00.718 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
06:03:02.548 --> 06:03:02.558 align:start position:0%
does this apply to
 
06:03:05.190 --> 06:03:05.200 align:start position:0%
all schools all public schools so
 
06:03:09.910 --> 06:03:09.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:09.920 --> 06:03:11.030 align:start position:0%
 
uh

06:03:11.030 --> 06:03:11.040 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:03:12.948 --> 06:03:12.958 align:start position:0%
it yes i believe it does because this is
 
06:03:15.190 --> 06:03:15.200 align:start position:0%
part of the rsa 189 as opposed to the
 
06:03:16.470 --> 06:03:16.480 align:start position:0%
minimum standards this would be all
 
06:03:18.548 --> 06:03:18.558 align:start position:0%
public schools which i believe includes
 
06:03:20.150 --> 06:03:20.160 align:start position:0%
charter schools as well and private
 
06:03:20.160 --> 06:03:21.110 align:start position:0%
charter schools as well and private
schools

06:03:21.110 --> 06:03:21.120 align:start position:0%
schools
 
06:03:23.590 --> 06:03:23.600 align:start position:0%
uh in this case i don't believe it
 
06:03:27.190 --> 06:03:27.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:29.270 --> 06:03:29.280 align:start position:0%
at the start of 189
 
06:03:31.190 --> 06:03:31.200 align:start position:0%
colon 11 it says in all public and
 
06:03:33.430 --> 06:03:33.440 align:start position:0%
private schools in the state and it's
 
06:03:35.110 --> 06:03:35.120 align:start position:0%
part of that
 
06:03:38.230 --> 06:03:38.240 align:start position:0%
chapter so i'm just wondering if it's
 
06:03:40.868 --> 06:03:40.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:42.070 --> 06:03:42.080 align:start position:0%
goes with it
 
06:03:43.510 --> 06:03:43.520 align:start position:0%
that's a good question
 
06:03:44.548 --> 06:03:44.558 align:start position:0%
okay and
 
06:03:46.628 --> 06:03:46.638 align:start position:0%
could i have a follow-up yes you may so
 
06:03:48.470 --> 06:03:48.480 align:start position:0%
uh who at the state department is
 
06:03:50.310 --> 06:03:50.320 align:start position:0%
collecting the data is it you is it your
 
06:03:53.830 --> 06:03:53.840 align:start position:0%
division it is okay thank you
 
06:03:57.270 --> 06:03:57.280 align:start position:0%
further questions mr represent moffatt
 
06:03:58.788 --> 06:03:58.798 align:start position:0%
thank you miss share and thank you for
 
06:04:00.708 --> 06:04:00.718 align:start position:0%
taking my question um
 
06:04:02.948 --> 06:04:02.958 align:start position:0%
i'm certainly american as a clerk here
 
06:04:06.070 --> 06:04:06.080 align:start position:0%
and i'm also was an original sponsor of
 
06:04:07.670 --> 06:04:07.680 align:start position:0%
the original bill
 
06:04:09.590 --> 06:04:09.600 align:start position:0%
and so just so
 
06:04:12.310 --> 06:04:12.320 align:start position:0%
i'm clear i just saw the uh
 
06:04:14.230 --> 06:04:14.240 align:start position:0%
the new language uh this separate sheet
 
06:04:16.150 --> 06:04:16.160 align:start position:0%
that just was passed around as i
 
06:04:17.510 --> 06:04:17.520 align:start position:0%
understand it
 
06:04:17.520 --> 06:04:18.948 align:start position:0%
understand it
d-o-e

06:04:18.948 --> 06:04:18.958 align:start position:0%
d-o-e
 
06:04:21.270 --> 06:04:21.280 align:start position:0%
identified two
 
06:04:24.390 --> 06:04:24.400 align:start position:0%
pieces of the current law that could be
 
06:04:27.270 --> 06:04:27.280 align:start position:0%
improved uh with different wording and
 
06:04:29.830 --> 06:04:29.840 align:start position:0%
those two pieces are
 
06:04:31.510 --> 06:04:31.520 align:start position:0%
number one
 
06:04:34.150 --> 06:04:34.160 align:start position:0%
the original in the current language
 
06:04:38.390 --> 06:04:38.400 align:start position:0%
said and says that schools may modify
 
06:04:41.030 --> 06:04:41.040 align:start position:0%
naturalization exam for a child with a
 
06:04:43.510 --> 06:04:43.520 align:start position:0%
disability in accordance with an iep
 
06:04:45.670 --> 06:04:45.680 align:start position:0%
so that's changed to
 
06:04:49.030 --> 06:04:49.040 align:start position:0%
uh it's actually added to that schools
 
06:04:51.190 --> 06:04:51.200 align:start position:0%
it now says are required to provide
 
06:04:53.910 --> 06:04:53.920 align:start position:0%
accommodations so whereas before it said
 
06:04:57.190 --> 06:04:57.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:00.230 --> 06:05:00.240 align:start position:0%
apply accommodations to ieps now it says
 
06:05:01.990 --> 06:05:02.000 align:start position:0%
they're required to provide
 
06:05:04.390 --> 06:05:04.400 align:start position:0%
accommodations so that's that's the the
 
06:05:06.390 --> 06:05:06.400 align:start position:0%
one change there is that correct
 
06:05:06.400 --> 06:05:07.270 align:start position:0%
one change there is that correct
yes

06:05:07.270 --> 06:05:07.280 align:start position:0%
yes
 
06:05:09.190 --> 06:05:09.200 align:start position:0%
thank you and then the second little
 
06:05:10.470 --> 06:05:10.480 align:start position:0%
piece of this
 
06:05:12.070 --> 06:05:12.080 align:start position:0%
uh which you just spoke to and just so
 
06:05:14.548 --> 06:05:14.558 align:start position:0%
that i and we're all clear
 
06:05:17.190 --> 06:05:17.200 align:start position:0%
the second piece clarified
 
06:05:17.200 --> 06:05:18.390 align:start position:0%
the second piece clarified
uh

06:05:18.390 --> 06:05:18.400 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:05:18.400 --> 06:05:19.110 align:start position:0%
uh
it's

06:05:19.110 --> 06:05:19.120 align:start position:0%
it's
 
06:05:21.110 --> 06:05:21.120 align:start position:0%
originally it said
 
06:05:23.590 --> 06:05:23.600 align:start position:0%
the law said that the two exams would be
 
06:05:23.600 --> 06:05:24.868 align:start position:0%
the law said that the two exams would be
taken

06:05:24.868 --> 06:05:24.878 align:start position:0%
taken
 
06:05:27.590 --> 06:05:27.600 align:start position:0%
but this clarifies the language and says
 
06:05:27.600 --> 06:05:28.788 align:start position:0%
but this clarifies the language and says
both

06:05:28.788 --> 06:05:28.798 align:start position:0%
both
 
06:05:33.590 --> 06:05:33.600 align:start position:0%
exams will be taken and that the uscis
 
06:05:35.030 --> 06:05:35.040 align:start position:0%
test uh
 
06:05:37.910 --> 06:05:37.920 align:start position:0%
is mandatory essentially is that is that
 
06:05:37.920 --> 06:05:39.670 align:start position:0%
is mandatory essentially is that is that
accurate

06:05:39.670 --> 06:05:39.680 align:start position:0%
accurate
 
06:05:41.430 --> 06:05:41.440 align:start position:0%
yeah so my understanding is that's
 
06:05:43.270 --> 06:05:43.280 align:start position:0%
already part of the legislation that
 
06:05:45.350 --> 06:05:45.360 align:start position:0%
schools uh are required to do both of
 
06:05:47.430 --> 06:05:47.440 align:start position:0%
those pieces and so the change that
 
06:05:48.868 --> 06:05:48.878 align:start position:0%
we're making here is the department is
 
06:05:50.548 --> 06:05:50.558 align:start position:0%
collecting the data on both of the
 
06:05:50.558 --> 06:05:52.708 align:start position:0%
collecting the data on both of the
examinations

06:05:52.708 --> 06:05:52.718 align:start position:0%
examinations
 
06:05:55.110 --> 06:05:55.120 align:start position:0%
and all students will be required to
 
06:05:56.788 --> 06:05:56.798 align:start position:0%
take the 2020
 
06:05:59.670 --> 06:05:59.680 align:start position:0%
version of the uscis test
 
06:06:01.670 --> 06:06:01.680 align:start position:0%
yes and that's part of the legislation
 
06:06:03.110 --> 06:06:03.120 align:start position:0%
already in law so that part has not
 
06:06:06.230 --> 06:06:06.240 align:start position:0%
changed okay uh thank you very much
 
06:06:07.910 --> 06:06:07.920 align:start position:0%
further questions represent woodcock
 
06:06:10.150 --> 06:06:10.160 align:start position:0%
thank you just the clarification um
 
06:06:11.830 --> 06:06:11.840 align:start position:0%
reverend led this this document that
 
06:06:14.788 --> 06:06:14.798 align:start position:0%
receives what is this document i
 
06:06:16.548 --> 06:06:16.558 align:start position:0%
i'm not looking at that document i'm
 
06:06:17.830 --> 06:06:17.840 align:start position:0%
using this
 
06:06:20.868 --> 06:06:20.878 align:start position:0%
language that i printed off this morning
 
06:06:22.470 --> 06:06:22.480 align:start position:0%
okay and
 
06:06:25.190 --> 06:06:25.200 align:start position:0%
so um may i yes
 
06:06:27.350 --> 06:06:27.360 align:start position:0%
representative hudson the the language
 
06:06:29.030 --> 06:06:29.040 align:start position:0%
that we received on
 
06:06:29.040 --> 06:06:31.270 align:start position:0%
that we received on
1367

06:06:31.270 --> 06:06:31.280 align:start position:0%
1367
 
06:06:32.708 --> 06:06:32.718 align:start position:0%
is different
 
06:06:34.788 --> 06:06:34.798 align:start position:0%
than the language that you just gave us
 
06:06:37.270 --> 06:06:37.280 align:start position:0%
in the supplemental piece of paper
 
06:06:40.150 --> 06:06:40.160 align:start position:0%
and i say that uh specifically as it
 
06:06:43.190 --> 06:06:43.200 align:start position:0%
regards the 128 question
 
06:06:44.788 --> 06:06:44.798 align:start position:0%
civics exam
 
06:06:45.990 --> 06:06:46.000 align:start position:0%
and the language you gave us on the
 
06:06:49.510 --> 06:06:49.520 align:start position:0%
supplemental sheet that is deleted
 
06:06:50.628 --> 06:06:50.638 align:start position:0%
from the
 
06:06:52.230 --> 06:06:52.240 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
06:06:55.110 --> 06:06:55.120 align:start position:0%
document yet an alarm on the chain that
 
06:06:56.948 --> 06:06:56.958 align:start position:0%
you presented is still in the dark
 
06:06:56.958 --> 06:06:57.990 align:start position:0%
you presented is still in the dark
internet

06:06:57.990 --> 06:06:58.000 align:start position:0%
internet
 
06:07:01.110 --> 06:07:01.120 align:start position:0%
yeah um so i was double checking the
 
06:07:02.948 --> 06:07:02.958 align:start position:0%
language required the language that
 
06:07:05.190 --> 06:07:05.200 align:start position:0%
changed uh last night and i didn't have
 
06:07:07.670 --> 06:07:07.680 align:start position:0%
a chance to look at this this morning um
 
06:07:09.590 --> 06:07:09.600 align:start position:0%
so when i i printed it off i didn't
 
06:07:12.310 --> 06:07:12.320 align:start position:0%
compare the two and i'm i was wondering
 
06:07:14.150 --> 06:07:14.160 align:start position:0%
which one are we using i guess we are
 
06:07:16.548 --> 06:07:16.558 align:start position:0%
using the bill that's been submitted to
 
06:07:19.350 --> 06:07:19.360 align:start position:0%

06:07:21.350 --> 06:07:21.360 align:start position:0%
discussed okay thank you thanks for my

here to introduce my bill hb 1533 which
 
06:11:44.310 --> 06:11:44.320 align:start position:0%
would add age appropriate instruction on
 
06:11:46.070 --> 06:11:46.080 align:start position:0%
the meaning of consent
 
06:11:48.390 --> 06:11:48.400 align:start position:0%

this legislation helps keep our youngest

granite staters safe by giving them the
 
06:11:57.430 --> 06:11:57.440 align:start position:0%
tools they need to establish and respect

protect themselves from abuse
 
06:12:05.750 --> 06:12:05.760 align:start position:0%
education and strategies related to
 
06:12:08.070 --> 06:12:08.080 align:start position:0%
consent can help stem the tide of
 
06:12:10.310 --> 06:12:10.320 align:start position:0%
domestic and sexual violence
 
06:12:12.708 --> 06:12:12.718 align:start position:0%
the psychological and physical impact of
 
06:12:14.628 --> 06:12:14.638 align:start position:0%
non-consensual sexual activities can
 
06:12:17.190 --> 06:12:17.200 align:start position:0%
last a lifetime there should be very
 
06:12:19.910 --> 06:12:19.920 align:start position:0%
little partisan ideology associated with
 
06:12:21.430 --> 06:12:21.440 align:start position:0%
wanting to prevent
 
06:12:23.910 --> 06:12:23.920 align:start position:0%
this type of harm
 
06:12:27.830 --> 06:12:27.840 align:start position:0%
as it currently stands in statute 189-10
 
06:12:30.390 --> 06:12:30.400 align:start position:0%
the state of new hampshire does and can
 
06:12:32.150 --> 06:12:32.160 align:start position:0%
dictate what topics are taught in
 
06:12:32.160 --> 06:12:33.190 align:start position:0%

from health and physical education to
 
06:12:38.390 --> 06:12:38.400 align:start position:0%
sexual well-being topics the precedent
 
06:12:40.070 --> 06:12:40.080 align:start position:0%
for preventing harm and promoting
 
06:12:42.390 --> 06:12:42.400 align:start position:0%
well-being through education is clearly
 
06:12:42.400 --> 06:12:43.750 align:start position:0%
well-being through education is clearly
established

06:12:43.750 --> 06:12:43.760 align:start position:0%

06:12:45.830 --> 06:12:45.840 align:start position:0%
this legislation has been endorsed by
 
06:12:47.430 --> 06:12:47.440 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire coalition against
 
06:12:50.310 --> 06:12:50.320 align:start position:0%

06:12:53.190 --> 06:12:53.200 align:start position:0%
trusted organization with a long history
 
06:12:55.830 --> 06:12:55.840 align:start position:0%
of bipartisan work
 
06:12:58.470 --> 06:12:58.480 align:start position:0%
this legislative proposal is also
 
06:13:00.470 --> 06:13:00.480 align:start position:0%
endorsed by the new hampshire youth
 
06:13:03.030 --> 06:13:03.040 align:start position:0%
movement and end sexual violence on

campus new hampshire
 
06:13:06.548 --> 06:13:06.558 align:start position:0%
these are two groups who clearly
 
06:13:08.708 --> 06:13:08.718 align:start position:0%
represent populations who are deeply
 
06:13:10.948 --> 06:13:10.958 align:start position:0%
impacted by the lack of education
 
06:13:13.270 --> 06:13:13.280 align:start position:0%
related to consent
 
06:13:16.230 --> 06:13:16.240 align:start position:0%
i strongly encourage everyone to closely
 
06:13:18.788 --> 06:13:18.798 align:start position:0%
read the written testimonies provided in
 
06:13:21.030 --> 06:13:21.040 align:start position:0%
support of this bill
 
06:13:23.430 --> 06:13:23.440 align:start position:0%
these have been given to us by parents
 
06:13:25.590 --> 06:13:25.600 align:start position:0%
students and organizations
 
06:13:27.590 --> 06:13:27.600 align:start position:0%
they provide powerful and heartfelt
 
06:13:29.190 --> 06:13:29.200 align:start position:0%
statements about the importance and
 
06:13:31.510 --> 06:13:31.520 align:start position:0%
urgency of our work
 
06:13:33.910 --> 06:13:33.920 align:start position:0%
according to empirical data
 
06:13:36.310 --> 06:13:36.320 align:start position:0%
20 percent of women in the u.s report
 
06:13:38.788 --> 06:13:38.798 align:start position:0%
being sexual assault survivors
 
06:13:40.628 --> 06:13:40.638 align:start position:0%
furthermore there appears to be
 
06:13:42.548 --> 06:13:42.558 align:start position:0%
something amiss societally and
 
06:13:45.110 --> 06:13:45.120 align:start position:0%
systematically when 25 percent of men
 
06:13:47.110 --> 06:13:47.120 align:start position:0%
admit to having caused non-consensual
 
06:13:48.868 --> 06:13:48.878 align:start position:0%
sexual harm
 
06:13:50.708 --> 06:13:50.718 align:start position:0%
as we will hear today
 
06:13:53.190 --> 06:13:53.200 align:start position:0%
these concerns around harm are
 
06:13:55.350 --> 06:13:55.360 align:start position:0%
particularly present for adolescents and
 
06:13:56.708 --> 06:13:56.718 align:start position:0%
young adults
 
06:13:59.270 --> 06:13:59.280 align:start position:0%
government has a moral imperative to
 
06:14:02.230 --> 06:14:02.240 align:start position:0%
address very real social issues that
 
06:14:04.548 --> 06:14:04.558 align:start position:0%
impact nearly every citizen when we
 
06:14:08.150 --> 06:14:08.160 align:start position:0%
consider both sides of the trauma cycle
 
06:14:10.788 --> 06:14:10.798 align:start position:0%
this is not a radical idea
 
06:14:13.110 --> 06:14:13.120 align:start position:0%
we already teach our students about
 
06:14:14.788 --> 06:14:14.798 align:start position:0%
physical education
 
06:14:17.430 --> 06:14:17.440 align:start position:0%
hygiene and the impact of alcohol and
 
06:14:17.440 --> 06:14:18.628 align:start position:0%
hygiene and the impact of alcohol and
drugs

06:14:18.628 --> 06:14:18.638 align:start position:0%
drugs
 
06:14:21.030 --> 06:14:21.040 align:start position:0%
we clearly share a vision of wanting to
 
06:14:23.830 --> 06:14:23.840 align:start position:0%
keep young people safe and healthy
 
06:14:25.750 --> 06:14:25.760 align:start position:0%
teaching consent is something that is
 
06:14:28.628 --> 06:14:28.638 align:start position:0%
preventative and already normalized in
 
06:14:30.470 --> 06:14:30.480 align:start position:0%
many other states
 
06:14:32.150 --> 06:14:32.160 align:start position:0%
several states and the district of
 
06:14:34.548 --> 06:14:34.558 align:start position:0%
columbia already require consent to be
 
06:14:36.070 --> 06:14:36.080 align:start position:0%
taught as part of public school
 
06:14:36.080 --> 06:14:37.350 align:start position:0%

with their stories
 
06:15:05.030 --> 06:15:05.040 align:start position:0%
a tremendous amount of thought was put
 
06:15:07.350 --> 06:15:07.360 align:start position:0%
into this i hope that you will pass this
 
06:15:09.670 --> 06:15:09.680 align:start position:0%
common sense legislation that is an
 
06:15:12.150 --> 06:15:12.160 align:start position:0%
essential public safety measure and will
 
06:15:14.470 --> 06:15:14.480 align:start position:0%
undoubtedly advance our shared interest
 
06:15:17.830 --> 06:15:17.840 align:start position:0%

and i want to begin with a simple and
 
06:16:57.990 --> 06:16:58.000 align:start position:0%
powerful statement
 
06:17:00.230 --> 06:17:00.240 align:start position:0%
my body belongs to me

your body belongs to you
 
06:17:06.548 --> 06:17:06.558 align:start position:0%
and that's a message that most of us
 
06:17:08.948 --> 06:17:08.958 align:start position:0%
internalize and use as our lodestar in
 
06:17:11.910 --> 06:17:11.920 align:start position:0%
our daily interactions we say excuse me
 
06:17:13.030 --> 06:17:13.040 align:start position:0%
tell me
 
06:17:14.390 --> 06:17:14.400 align:start position:0%
when walking around each other in the
 
06:17:16.628 --> 06:17:16.638 align:start position:0%
hallways and here at the lob and for
 
06:17:18.868 --> 06:17:18.878 align:start position:0%
those of us that go to a gym or a yoga
 
06:17:21.830 --> 06:17:21.840 align:start position:0%
studio or dance class we make space for
 
06:17:23.910 --> 06:17:23.920 align:start position:0%
each other around so that we can move
 
06:17:25.670 --> 06:17:25.680 align:start position:0%
our bodies without crashing into each
 
06:17:28.390 --> 06:17:28.400 align:start position:0%
other and possibly causing harm
 
06:17:29.910 --> 06:17:29.920 align:start position:0%
when we're in line in the cafeteria
 
06:17:32.470 --> 06:17:32.480 align:start position:0%
downstairs we have an expectation that
 
06:17:34.150 --> 06:17:34.160 align:start position:0%
we can get in line for our meal without

and why we should behave like this
 
06:17:45.670 --> 06:17:45.680 align:start position:0%
is important to our safety and when
 
06:17:47.910 --> 06:17:47.920 align:start position:0%
these boundaries are breached we should
 
06:17:49.990 --> 06:17:50.000 align:start position:0%
also know that we have the knowledge and
 
06:17:52.070 --> 06:17:52.080 align:start position:0%
support that is never too late to tell
 
06:17:54.628 --> 06:17:54.638 align:start position:0%
someone and that we can get help
 
06:17:57.190 --> 06:17:57.200 align:start position:0%
unfortunately across new hampshire our
 
06:17:59.510 --> 06:17:59.520 align:start position:0%
students are not learning the basics of
 
06:18:01.910 --> 06:18:01.920 align:start position:0%
personal body safety and we have the
 
06:18:04.150 --> 06:18:04.160 align:start position:0%

a decline in child abuse it was the
 
06:19:04.548 --> 06:19:04.558 align:start position:0%

we have data from the centers of disease

graphic on the back page of the
 
06:19:35.030 --> 06:19:35.040 align:start position:0%
testimony that you just received that
 
06:19:37.430 --> 06:19:37.440 align:start position:0%
show one in three female rape victims
 
06:19:38.948 --> 06:19:38.958 align:start position:0%
experienced it for the first time
 
06:19:41.910 --> 06:19:41.920 align:start position:0%
between the ages of 11 and 17 years old
 
06:19:43.990 --> 06:19:44.000 align:start position:0%
and one in eight reported that that
 
06:19:46.150 --> 06:19:46.160 align:start position:0%
occurred between the ages
 
06:19:48.390 --> 06:19:48.400 align:start position:0%
before the age of ten
 
06:19:50.788 --> 06:19:50.798 align:start position:0%
nearly one in four young men rape
 
06:19:53.590 --> 06:19:53.600 align:start position:0%
victims experience it for the first time
 
06:19:57.110 --> 06:19:57.120 align:start position:0%
between the ages of 11 and 17 years old
 
06:19:59.190 --> 06:19:59.200 align:start position:0%
and one in four reported that it
 
06:20:01.750 --> 06:20:01.760 align:start position:0%
occurred to them before the age of 10
 
06:20:03.590 --> 06:20:03.600 align:start position:0%
and a piece that is missing from my
 
06:20:06.310 --> 06:20:06.320 align:start position:0%
testimony but i want to re i want to
 
06:20:08.628 --> 06:20:08.638 align:start position:0%
make sure you know this the average
 
06:20:10.468 --> 06:20:10.478 align:start position:0%
reporting age
 
06:20:13.270 --> 06:20:13.280 align:start position:0%
of an adult who experienced child sexual
 
06:20:15.350 --> 06:20:15.360 align:start position:0%
abuse during these times that are that
 
06:20:16.948 --> 06:20:16.958 align:start position:0%
are documented
 
06:20:21.030 --> 06:20:21.040 align:start position:0%
the average age is 52.
 
06:20:23.350 --> 06:20:23.360 align:start position:0%
so people hang on to that information
 
06:20:26.310 --> 06:20:26.320 align:start position:0%
for a very very long time
 
06:20:29.030 --> 06:20:29.040 align:start position:0%
we think that schools are the best place
 
06:20:31.670 --> 06:20:31.680 align:start position:0%
to reach the most children
 
06:20:33.670 --> 06:20:33.680 align:start position:0%
to talk about personal body safety and
 
06:20:35.430 --> 06:20:35.440 align:start position:0%
that it is their right they have the
 
06:20:38.070 --> 06:20:38.080 align:start position:0%
right to be safe they have the right to
 
06:20:40.150 --> 06:20:40.160 align:start position:0%
keep their bodies safe
 
06:20:41.990 --> 06:20:42.000 align:start position:0%
to clarify
 
06:20:45.910 --> 06:20:45.920 align:start position:0%
this language is not about sex education
 
06:20:47.990 --> 06:20:48.000 align:start position:0%
as i explained in an interview last
 
06:20:49.830 --> 06:20:49.840 align:start position:0%
thursday with peter biello on new
 
06:20:51.510 --> 06:20:51.520 align:start position:0%
hampshire public radio
 
06:20:53.190 --> 06:20:53.200 align:start position:0%
adding elements
 
06:20:55.510 --> 06:20:55.520 align:start position:0%
of consent awareness to sex education
 
06:20:57.830 --> 06:20:57.840 align:start position:0%
would be a welcome supplement to that
 
06:20:59.670 --> 06:20:59.680 align:start position:0%
particular curriculum
 
06:21:02.070 --> 06:21:02.080 align:start position:0%
the meaning of consent respect for
 
06:21:04.230 --> 06:21:04.240 align:start position:0%
personal boundaries and sexual violence
 
06:21:07.430 --> 06:21:07.440 align:start position:0%
prevention education are much broader
 
06:21:09.910 --> 06:21:09.920 align:start position:0%
than sex education this language
 
06:21:14.708 --> 06:21:14.718 align:start position:0%
proposal is not about sex education
 
06:21:17.110 --> 06:21:17.120 align:start position:0%
children need to learn the basics of
 
06:21:19.110 --> 06:21:19.120 align:start position:0%
sexual violence prevention healthy
 
06:21:20.868 --> 06:21:20.878 align:start position:0%
boundaries and our friendships
 
06:21:22.788 --> 06:21:22.798 align:start position:0%
relationships with their teachers
 
06:21:25.910 --> 06:21:25.920 align:start position:0%
coaches scout leaders faith leaders and
 
06:21:28.788 --> 06:21:28.798 align:start position:0%
family members are critical it should be
 
06:21:31.270 --> 06:21:31.280 align:start position:0%
common knowledge for students that
 
06:21:34.310 --> 06:21:34.320 align:start position:0%
touches in the private areas are never a
 
06:21:34.320 --> 06:21:35.590 align:start position:0%
touches in the private areas are never a
secret

06:21:35.590 --> 06:21:35.600 align:start position:0%
secret
 
06:21:37.510 --> 06:21:37.520 align:start position:0%
students coming out of new hampshire
 
06:21:38.708 --> 06:21:38.718 align:start position:0%
high schools
 
06:21:41.990 --> 06:21:42.000 align:start position:0%
should be well versed in consent
 
06:21:44.070 --> 06:21:44.080 align:start position:0%
this type of programming is what we
 
06:21:47.750 --> 06:21:47.760 align:start position:0%
propose in house bill 1533 currently
 
06:21:50.948 --> 06:21:50.958 align:start position:0%
only some of new hampshire students have
 
06:21:53.110 --> 06:21:53.120 align:start position:0%
access to age-appropriate instruction on
 
06:21:54.788 --> 06:21:54.798 align:start position:0%
the meaning of consent to respect for
 
06:21:56.948 --> 06:21:56.958 align:start position:0%
personal boundaries and sexual violence
 
06:21:59.670 --> 06:21:59.680 align:start position:0%
prevention only some
 
06:22:02.070 --> 06:22:02.080 align:start position:0%
so as policy makers i'll ask you to look
 
06:22:04.150 --> 06:22:04.160 align:start position:0%
at this from a risk management
 
06:22:06.468 --> 06:22:06.478 align:start position:0%
perspective with this
 
06:22:09.190 --> 06:22:09.200 align:start position:0%
with this particular rsa
 
06:22:11.190 --> 06:22:11.200 align:start position:0%
in this rsa we have a section called
 
06:22:13.430 --> 06:22:13.440 align:start position:0%
emergency response plans and it says
 
06:22:15.830 --> 06:22:15.840 align:start position:0%
that all public schools chartered and
 
06:22:18.230 --> 06:22:18.240 align:start position:0%
private schools have to have emergency
 
06:22:20.310 --> 06:22:20.320 align:start position:0%
response plans like fire drills and
 
06:22:22.310 --> 06:22:22.320 align:start position:0%
active shooter drills
 
06:22:24.390 --> 06:22:24.400 align:start position:0%
and i have given you a copy on page
 
06:22:24.400 --> 06:22:25.430 align:start position:0%
and i have given you a copy on page
three

06:22:25.430 --> 06:22:25.440 align:start position:0%
three
 
06:22:29.350 --> 06:22:29.360 align:start position:0%
of um the 180 189 64 the emergency
 
06:22:31.190 --> 06:22:31.200 align:start position:0%
response plans this is built into
 
06:22:31.200 --> 06:22:32.230 align:start position:0%
response plans this is built into
statute

06:22:32.230 --> 06:22:32.240 align:start position:0%
statute
 
06:22:35.350 --> 06:22:35.360 align:start position:0%
and then in our um
 
06:22:37.510 --> 06:22:37.520 align:start position:0%
in our recommendation is that we would
 
06:22:38.468 --> 06:22:38.478 align:start position:0%
like to
 
06:22:41.350 --> 06:22:41.360 align:start position:0%
build upon an emergency response
 
06:22:44.150 --> 06:22:44.160 align:start position:0%
so let's talk about this emergency
 
06:22:46.468 --> 06:22:46.478 align:start position:0%
response fire safety most of us who have
 
06:22:48.548 --> 06:22:48.558 align:start position:0%
had children who have attended
 
06:22:50.230 --> 06:22:50.240 align:start position:0%
new hampshire elementary schools know
 
06:22:51.990 --> 06:22:52.000 align:start position:0%
that the day that the local fire
 
06:22:54.390 --> 06:22:54.400 align:start position:0%
department comes to school with a ladder
 
06:22:57.030 --> 06:22:57.040 align:start position:0%
truck is an awesome day
 
06:23:01.030 --> 06:23:01.040 align:start position:0%
it's amazing we hear about it for weeks
 
06:23:03.510 --> 06:23:03.520 align:start position:0%
every day every school in new hampshire
 
06:23:05.270 --> 06:23:05.280 align:start position:0%
in accordance with the law
 
06:23:07.350 --> 06:23:07.360 align:start position:0%
which is on page three
 
06:23:10.070 --> 06:23:10.080 align:start position:0%
conducts fire drills for students while
 
06:23:12.310 --> 06:23:12.320 align:start position:0%
they are in school
 
06:23:14.708 --> 06:23:14.718 align:start position:0%
additionally children as young as pre-k
 
06:23:17.430 --> 06:23:17.440 align:start position:0%
in kindergarten can tell you what to do
 
06:23:20.548 --> 06:23:20.558 align:start position:0%
if their clothing catches on fire and we
 
06:23:24.230 --> 06:23:24.240 align:start position:0%
all know this stop drop and roll that's
 
06:23:26.628 --> 06:23:26.638 align:start position:0%
personal body safety stop chop and roll
 
06:23:28.708 --> 06:23:28.718 align:start position:0%
is a message that gets repeated over and
 
06:23:30.868 --> 06:23:30.878 align:start position:0%
over and over again until it becomes
 
06:23:33.590 --> 06:23:33.600 align:start position:0%
reflexive that's called proactive
 
06:23:35.910 --> 06:23:35.920 align:start position:0%
prevention messaging
 
06:23:37.830 --> 06:23:37.840 align:start position:0%
with the additional language we propose
 
06:23:42.070 --> 06:23:42.080 align:start position:0%
to be added to our rsa 189 10
 
06:23:44.150 --> 06:23:44.160 align:start position:0%
schools will have the obligation under
 
06:23:47.030 --> 06:23:47.040 align:start position:0%
statute to provide prevention primary
 
06:23:49.670 --> 06:23:49.680 align:start position:0%
prevention education for what we know
 
06:23:52.390 --> 06:23:52.400 align:start position:0%
is a real and documented risk of injury
 
06:23:55.110 --> 06:23:55.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:23:58.310 --> 06:23:58.320 align:start position:0%
children have more of a chance
 
06:24:00.468 --> 06:24:00.478 align:start position:0%
of being a probability
 
06:24:02.788 --> 06:24:02.798 align:start position:0%
of being sexually assaulted than they do
 
06:24:04.708 --> 06:24:04.718 align:start position:0%
of catching on fire
 
06:24:06.628 --> 06:24:06.638 align:start position:0%
we should be teaching them about
 
06:24:08.948 --> 06:24:08.958 align:start position:0%
personal body safety and that
 
06:24:11.430 --> 06:24:11.440 align:start position:0%
when and if someone touches them that
 
06:24:14.070 --> 06:24:14.080 align:start position:0%
makes them feel hurt confused or scared
 
06:24:20.708 --> 06:24:20.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:24:27.670 --> 06:24:27.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:24:29.270 --> 06:24:29.280 align:start position:0%
a few years ago prior to my serving in
 
06:24:30.948 --> 06:24:30.958 align:start position:0%
the house i had the privilege of working
 
06:24:32.788 --> 06:24:32.798 align:start position:0%
with an advocate
 
06:24:34.390 --> 06:24:34.400 align:start position:0%
who accompanied a family to the
 
06:24:36.230 --> 06:24:36.240 align:start position:0%
stratford county
 
06:24:38.310 --> 06:24:38.320 align:start position:0%
child advocacy center and she was there
 
06:24:41.270 --> 06:24:41.280 align:start position:0%
to support a family whose young son
 
06:24:43.670 --> 06:24:43.680 align:start position:0%
was one of a number of children who had
 
06:24:46.628 --> 06:24:46.638 align:start position:0%
been abused by a single perpetrator
 
06:24:48.390 --> 06:24:48.400 align:start position:0%
and the family of course was distraught
 
06:24:50.628 --> 06:24:50.638 align:start position:0%
as one as a family would be
 
06:24:52.390 --> 06:24:52.400 align:start position:0%
um there's distraught that this had
 
06:24:54.548 --> 06:24:54.558 align:start position:0%
happened they were distraught about now
 
06:24:56.230 --> 06:24:56.240 align:start position:0%
what comes next
 
06:24:59.590 --> 06:24:59.600 align:start position:0%
and um and they were um really upset and
 
06:25:02.468 --> 06:25:02.478 align:start position:0%
concerned about how this little boy this
 
06:25:04.468 --> 06:25:04.478 align:start position:0%
little third grader
 
06:25:06.708 --> 06:25:06.718 align:start position:0%
was going to cope with the forensic
 
06:25:08.788 --> 06:25:08.798 align:start position:0%
interview process
 
06:25:11.510 --> 06:25:11.520 align:start position:0%
when the interview was over
 
06:25:14.230 --> 06:25:14.240 align:start position:0%
the little boy who had lightning mcqueen
 
06:25:16.468 --> 06:25:16.478 align:start position:0%
light up sneakers and a wiggly tooth
 
06:25:19.030 --> 06:25:19.040 align:start position:0%
came out and he walked out of an
 
06:25:22.150 --> 06:25:22.160 align:start position:0%
interview room where he had just been
 
06:25:24.868 --> 06:25:24.878 align:start position:0%
part of a forensic interview about his
 
06:25:27.430 --> 06:25:27.440 align:start position:0%
sexual assault and he was actually
 
06:25:30.390 --> 06:25:30.400 align:start position:0%
beaming and this really struck the
 
06:25:33.030 --> 06:25:33.040 align:start position:0%
advocate because that's unusual to have
 
06:25:35.590 --> 06:25:35.600 align:start position:0%
a child like beaming ear to ear
 
06:25:38.628 --> 06:25:38.638 align:start position:0%
and the family's response was like how
 
06:25:40.468 --> 06:25:40.478 align:start position:0%
are you feeling how are you doing
 
06:25:42.708 --> 06:25:42.718 align:start position:0%
you know like very would
 
06:25:45.510 --> 06:25:45.520 align:start position:0%
want to support him in the best way but
 
06:25:48.230 --> 06:25:48.240 align:start position:0%
really not expecting that response
 
06:25:51.190 --> 06:25:51.200 align:start position:0%
and he said i'm good i'm good the puppet
 
06:25:53.270 --> 06:25:53.280 align:start position:0%
people told me i could keep telling
 
06:25:54.708 --> 06:25:54.718 align:start position:0%
until i got help
 
06:25:56.070 --> 06:25:56.080 align:start position:0%
and i did
 
06:25:59.750 --> 06:25:59.760 align:start position:0%
and it worked this little boy was a
 
06:26:01.670 --> 06:26:01.680 align:start position:0%
student he was a third grade student at
 
06:26:03.590 --> 06:26:03.600 align:start position:0%
a school that really valued violence
 
06:26:06.230 --> 06:26:06.240 align:start position:0%
prevention education and he had been
 
06:26:08.150 --> 06:26:08.160 align:start position:0%
exposed to the personal body safety
 
06:26:10.628 --> 06:26:10.638 align:start position:0%
curriculum that age-appropriate
 
06:26:13.190 --> 06:26:13.200 align:start position:0%
programming began for him with friendly
 
06:26:15.190 --> 06:26:15.200 align:start position:0%
puppets in kindergarten
 
06:26:17.830 --> 06:26:17.840 align:start position:0%
first grade and second grade
 
06:26:20.070 --> 06:26:20.080 align:start position:0%
his he was now in third grade and his
 
06:26:22.788 --> 06:26:22.798 align:start position:0%
school his classroom was not scheduled
 
06:26:25.590 --> 06:26:25.600 align:start position:0%
to have that program again till later in
 
06:26:28.230 --> 06:26:28.240 align:start position:0%
the spring so we know that violence
 
06:26:31.430 --> 06:26:31.440 align:start position:0%
prevention education works
 
06:26:31.440 --> 06:26:32.310 align:start position:0%
prevention education works
and

06:26:32.310 --> 06:26:32.320 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:26:35.190 --> 06:26:35.200 align:start position:0%
lastly i'll share an experience of
 
06:26:37.430 --> 06:26:37.440 align:start position:0%
our educators working with an eighth
 
06:26:39.190 --> 06:26:39.200 align:start position:0%
grade classroom and there was a young
 
06:26:41.590 --> 06:26:41.600 align:start position:0%
girl in the classroom who was new to the
 
06:26:43.750 --> 06:26:43.760 align:start position:0%
school within a year or two and she had
 
06:26:45.670 --> 06:26:45.680 align:start position:0%
been sexually abused as
 
06:26:48.150 --> 06:26:48.160 align:start position:0%
um as a really really young child in
 
06:26:50.548 --> 06:26:50.558 align:start position:0%
elementary school but as she has moved
 
06:26:54.468 --> 06:26:54.478 align:start position:0%
away and um she had been told over and
 
06:26:56.468 --> 06:26:56.478 align:start position:0%
over and over again during the abuse
 
06:26:59.030 --> 06:26:59.040 align:start position:0%
that she could not tell anyone
 
06:27:00.948 --> 06:27:00.958 align:start position:0%
and that this was
 
06:27:02.868 --> 06:27:02.878 align:start position:0%
this was not abuse
 
06:27:05.350 --> 06:27:05.360 align:start position:0%
but she learned through that program
 
06:27:07.430 --> 06:27:07.440 align:start position:0%
that what she experienced and the reason
 
06:27:09.990 --> 06:27:10.000 align:start position:0%
she felt so hurt confused and scared was
 
06:27:13.750 --> 06:27:13.760 align:start position:0%
that it was abuse and this educator gave
 
06:27:15.510 --> 06:27:15.520 align:start position:0%
her the permission
 
06:27:17.510 --> 06:27:17.520 align:start position:0%
and the empowerment
 
06:27:19.910 --> 06:27:19.920 align:start position:0%
to say that happened to me and to get
 
06:27:21.670 --> 06:27:21.680 align:start position:0%
the help that she needed
 
06:27:23.990 --> 06:27:24.000 align:start position:0%
so we just believe every student from
 
06:27:25.830 --> 06:27:25.840 align:start position:0%
nashua to pittsburgh
 
06:27:27.510 --> 06:27:27.520 align:start position:0%
lyme to conway
 
06:27:29.590 --> 06:27:29.600 align:start position:0%
hinsdale to sanborn ville and every
 
06:27:31.990 --> 06:27:32.000 align:start position:0%
school district in between should have
 
06:27:34.230 --> 06:27:34.240 align:start position:0%

occurrence of teen dating violence
 
06:29:15.270 --> 06:29:15.280 align:start position:0%
and prevent its harmful and long-lasting
 
06:29:17.110 --> 06:29:17.120 align:start position:0%
effects on individuals there are
 
06:29:18.948 --> 06:29:18.958 align:start position:0%
families and the communities where they

families and the communities where they
live

06:29:20.628 --> 06:29:20.638 align:start position:0%
live
 
06:29:22.868 --> 06:29:22.878 align:start position:0%
during the pre-teen and teen years it is
 
06:29:25.190 --> 06:29:25.200 align:start position:0%
critical for both for youth to begin
 
06:29:27.110 --> 06:29:27.120 align:start position:0%
learning the skills needed to create and
 
06:29:29.670 --> 06:29:29.680 align:start position:0%
maintain healthy relationships
 
06:29:31.030 --> 06:29:31.040 align:start position:0%
these skills
 
06:29:33.590 --> 06:29:33.600 align:start position:0%
include knowing how to manage feelings
 
06:29:36.390 --> 06:29:36.400 align:start position:0%
and how to communicate in a healthy way
 
06:29:38.548 --> 06:29:38.558 align:start position:0%
teaching our young granite staters these
 
06:29:40.788 --> 06:29:40.798 align:start position:0%
valuable skills early on will help set
 
06:29:43.030 --> 06:29:43.040 align:start position:0%
them up for a more successful prosperous
 
06:29:44.708 --> 06:29:44.718 align:start position:0%

06:29:57.510 --> 06:29:57.520 align:start position:0%
yes representative moffat

thank you miss sheridan i know uh
 
06:30:00.788 --> 06:30:00.798 align:start position:0%
representative schiller had to leave and

i guess you do too and oh she's still
 
06:30:04.548 --> 06:30:04.558 align:start position:0%
here um
 
06:30:07.270 --> 06:30:07.280 align:start position:0%
so i very sympathetic the intent of the
 
06:30:08.788 --> 06:30:08.798 align:start position:0%
bill in
 
06:30:10.468 --> 06:30:10.478 align:start position:0%
having been around a little while
 
06:30:12.150 --> 06:30:12.160 align:start position:0%
looking at language
 
06:30:15.510 --> 06:30:15.520 align:start position:0%
uh and also understanding uh how lawyers
 
06:30:17.670 --> 06:30:17.680 align:start position:0%
or attorneys sometimes look at language
 
06:30:17.680 --> 06:30:18.390 align:start position:0%
or attorneys sometimes look at language
uh

06:30:18.390 --> 06:30:18.400 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:30:20.230 --> 06:30:20.240 align:start position:0%
i saw a woman in the back room look up
 
06:30:22.628 --> 06:30:22.638 align:start position:0%
at me i said attorneys but i think it's
 
06:30:25.670 --> 06:30:25.680 align:start position:0%
important because um
 
06:30:27.590 --> 06:30:27.600 align:start position:0%
we need to
 
06:30:29.670 --> 06:30:29.680 align:start position:0%
look at how these words might be
 
06:30:33.030 --> 06:30:33.040 align:start position:0%
interpreted by simon so i simply i see
 
06:30:36.150 --> 06:30:36.160 align:start position:0%
age-appropriate instruction
 
06:30:38.788 --> 06:30:38.798 align:start position:0%
in age appropriate i'm not sure that
 
06:30:40.468 --> 06:30:40.478 align:start position:0%
there's consensus on that maybe there is
 
06:30:42.868 --> 06:30:42.878 align:start position:0%
you're all ahead of me on on this uh
 
06:30:44.708 --> 06:30:44.718 align:start position:0%
what is age-appropriate instruction and
 
06:30:46.708 --> 06:30:46.718 align:start position:0%
then the meaning of consent again i
 
06:30:48.708 --> 06:30:48.718 align:start position:0%
you're way ahead of me on this i'm just
 
06:30:51.030 --> 06:30:51.040 align:start position:0%
looking at this which is our job is to
 
06:30:52.468 --> 06:30:52.478 align:start position:0%
look at the language
 
06:30:55.110 --> 06:30:55.120 align:start position:0%
uh what is the meaning of consent i i
 
06:30:57.110 --> 06:30:57.120 align:start position:0%
don't know
 
06:30:59.510 --> 06:30:59.520 align:start position:0%
but i suspect there may be some folks
 
06:31:02.708 --> 06:31:02.718 align:start position:0%
whose meaning of consent uh might differ
 
06:31:04.788 --> 06:31:04.798 align:start position:0%
from someone else's i i don't know
 
06:31:06.390 --> 06:31:06.400 align:start position:0%
that's my question along with personal
 
06:31:08.310 --> 06:31:08.320 align:start position:0%
boundaries personal boundaries comes to
 
06:31:10.150 --> 06:31:10.160 align:start position:0%
some cultural things a lot of us have
 
06:31:11.670 --> 06:31:11.680 align:start position:0%
traveled around the world
 
06:31:13.990 --> 06:31:14.000 align:start position:0%
and you know in some cultures people get
 
06:31:15.910 --> 06:31:15.920 align:start position:0%
in your face and that's how they do
 
06:31:17.910 --> 06:31:17.920 align:start position:0%
business and other cultures uh that
 
06:31:19.750 --> 06:31:19.760 align:start position:0%
they're just different cultures so
 
06:31:21.190 --> 06:31:21.200 align:start position:0%
there's a cultural concern there so
 
06:31:24.310 --> 06:31:24.320 align:start position:0%
anyway my question is uh in terms of
 
06:31:25.910 --> 06:31:25.920 align:start position:0%
definition of personal boundaries
 
06:31:27.430 --> 06:31:27.440 align:start position:0%
age-appropriate instruction meaning of
 
06:31:30.548 --> 06:31:30.558 align:start position:0%
consent is do is your consensus on those
 
06:31:32.150 --> 06:31:32.160 align:start position:0%
i don't know
 
06:31:33.270 --> 06:31:33.280 align:start position:0%
yeah um
 
06:31:35.750 --> 06:31:35.760 align:start position:0%
i think some of the reason for
 
06:31:35.760 --> 06:31:36.948 align:start position:0%
i think some of the reason for
uh

06:31:36.948 --> 06:31:36.958 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:31:38.628 --> 06:31:38.638 align:start position:0%
i i definitely see what you're getting
 
06:31:40.708 --> 06:31:40.718 align:start position:0%
at is that there is a little bit of i
 
06:31:42.548 --> 06:31:42.558 align:start position:0%
don't want to say vague but
 
06:31:45.510 --> 06:31:45.520 align:start position:0%
wiggle room in these definitions um it's
 
06:31:47.590 --> 06:31:47.600 align:start position:0%
that way that we can give our teachers
 
06:31:49.670 --> 06:31:49.680 align:start position:0%
and our school districts and our local
 
06:31:51.190 --> 06:31:51.200 align:start position:0%
control uh
 
06:31:52.628 --> 06:31:52.638 align:start position:0%
like you know school boards or whatever
 
06:31:55.510 --> 06:31:55.520 align:start position:0%
that may be the ability to kind of tweak
 
06:31:57.110 --> 06:31:57.120 align:start position:0%
and adjust
 
06:31:59.590 --> 06:31:59.600 align:start position:0%
to those different uh needs of their
 
06:32:01.750 --> 06:32:01.760 align:start position:0%
communities so i think the perfect
 
06:32:03.350 --> 06:32:03.360 align:start position:0%
example of your
 
06:32:04.708 --> 06:32:04.718 align:start position:0%
your cultural
 
06:32:06.708 --> 06:32:06.718 align:start position:0%
reference there um
 
06:32:08.230 --> 06:32:08.240 align:start position:0%
you know what might be needed down in
 
06:32:11.110 --> 06:32:11.120 align:start position:0%
nashua or manchester where we do have a
 
06:32:12.390 --> 06:32:12.400 align:start position:0%
lot of
 
06:32:14.628 --> 06:32:14.638 align:start position:0%
international people going to our public
 
06:32:16.948 --> 06:32:16.958 align:start position:0%
schools might be very different than
 
06:32:19.510 --> 06:32:19.520 align:start position:0%
somewhere up north where there might not
 
06:32:20.708 --> 06:32:20.718 align:start position:0%
be as many
 
06:32:22.390 --> 06:32:22.400 align:start position:0%
people of different cultures if that
 
06:32:24.230 --> 06:32:24.240 align:start position:0%
makes sense
 
06:32:26.150 --> 06:32:26.160 align:start position:0%
thank you i'm tracking
 
06:32:28.708 --> 06:32:28.718 align:start position:0%
you wanted to have some you said wiggle
 
06:32:30.548 --> 06:32:30.558 align:start position:0%
room so i guess there's follow-ups you
 
06:32:33.350 --> 06:32:33.360 align:start position:0%
wanted some wig room so by not being too
 
06:32:35.110 --> 06:32:35.120 align:start position:0%
prescriptive you allow
 
06:32:37.430 --> 06:32:37.440 align:start position:0%
uh i guess districts to have some
 
06:32:39.030 --> 06:32:39.040 align:start position:0%
discretion in terms of how they
 
06:32:41.510 --> 06:32:41.520 align:start position:0%
implement the intent of the measure is
 
06:32:42.708 --> 06:32:42.718 align:start position:0%
that fair to say
 
06:32:45.990 --> 06:32:46.000 align:start position:0%
correct correct great great thank you
 
06:32:48.868 --> 06:32:48.878 align:start position:0%
are there further questions
 
06:32:54.868 --> 06:32:54.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:33:09.510 --> 06:33:09.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:33:09.520 --> 06:33:11.270 align:start position:0%
 
welcome

06:33:11.270 --> 06:33:11.280 align:start position:0%
welcome
 
06:33:12.788 --> 06:33:12.798 align:start position:0%
thank you for having me can you hear me
 
06:33:14.468 --> 06:33:14.478 align:start position:0%

06:33:14.478 --> 06:33:17.110 align:start position:0%
okay not used to speaking in a
microphone

06:33:17.110 --> 06:33:17.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:33:19.350 --> 06:33:19.360 align:start position:0%
my name is renee montiel i'm from keene

postpartum doula
 
06:33:26.628 --> 06:33:26.638 align:start position:0%
a childbirth educator and a reproductive
 
06:33:30.548 --> 06:33:30.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:33:32.390 --> 06:33:32.400 align:start position:0%
can you move the mic a little closer to
 
06:33:34.628 --> 06:33:34.638 align:start position:0%
you yes is this better yeah it's much
 
06:33:36.868 --> 06:33:36.878 align:start position:0%
better all right thank you
 
06:33:36.878 --> 06:33:37.590 align:start position:0%
better all right thank you
so

06:33:37.590 --> 06:33:37.600 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:33:39.670 --> 06:33:39.680 align:start position:0%
i also have two school-aged daughters
 
06:33:41.190 --> 06:33:41.200 align:start position:0%
and um
 
06:33:43.030 --> 06:33:43.040 align:start position:0%
i started teaching them about consent at
 
06:33:45.030 --> 06:33:45.040 align:start position:0%
a very early age you know whether it's
 
06:33:45.040 --> 06:33:46.628 align:start position:0%
a very early age you know whether it's
uh

06:33:46.628 --> 06:33:46.638 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:33:46.638 --> 06:33:47.750 align:start position:0%
uh
um

06:33:47.750 --> 06:33:47.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:33:49.830 --> 06:33:49.840 align:start position:0%
you know my one daughter wanting to bite
 
06:33:52.868 --> 06:33:52.878 align:start position:0%
her sister's toes i'm like no that's you
 
06:33:54.788 --> 06:33:54.798 align:start position:0%
don't have consent to abide your sister
 
06:33:56.708 --> 06:33:56.718 align:start position:0%
you know things start really early on
 
06:33:56.718 --> 06:33:57.430 align:start position:0%
you know things start really early on
the

06:33:57.430 --> 06:33:57.440 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:33:59.030 --> 06:33:59.040 align:start position:0%
on the home front
 
06:34:01.110 --> 06:34:01.120 align:start position:0%
teaching consent
 
06:34:03.110 --> 06:34:03.120 align:start position:0%
is teaching life skills
 
06:34:05.270 --> 06:34:05.280 align:start position:0%
teaching consent is also about giving
 
06:34:06.948 --> 06:34:06.958 align:start position:0%
all of our children the tools they need
 
06:34:09.270 --> 06:34:09.280 align:start position:0%
to navigate society safely
 
06:34:10.708 --> 06:34:10.718 align:start position:0%
with confidence
 
06:34:13.030 --> 06:34:13.040 align:start position:0%
and being able to hold firm boundaries
 
06:34:15.910 --> 06:34:15.920 align:start position:0%
with a strong sense of body sovereignty
 
06:34:17.270 --> 06:34:17.280 align:start position:0%
it's about helping our children and
 
06:34:19.110 --> 06:34:19.120 align:start position:0%
teens learning to respect both their
 
06:34:21.990 --> 06:34:22.000 align:start position:0%
desires and the desires of others
 
06:34:23.350 --> 06:34:23.360 align:start position:0%
it's about learning that other people's
 
06:34:25.670 --> 06:34:25.680 align:start position:0%
bodies don't exist to serve
 
06:34:28.070 --> 06:34:28.080 align:start position:0%
others teaching consent is teaching a
 
06:34:31.910 --> 06:34:31.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:34:33.590 --> 06:34:33.600 align:start position:0%
one may ask if it's necessary to teach
 
06:34:37.670 --> 06:34:37.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:34:39.430 --> 06:34:39.440 align:start position:0%
teaching younger children starts with
 
06:34:41.590 --> 06:34:41.600 align:start position:0%
just teaching space body in touch it's
 
06:34:43.670 --> 06:34:43.680 align:start position:0%
about giving permission whether it's
 
06:34:46.390 --> 06:34:46.400 align:start position:0%
hugs or borrowing personal items
 
06:34:48.788 --> 06:34:48.798 align:start position:0%
as an educator i've been approached many
 
06:34:52.548 --> 06:34:52.558 align:start position:0%
times by parents asking me to
 
06:34:54.468 --> 06:34:54.478 align:start position:0%
help them either discuss this with their
 
06:34:57.110 --> 06:34:57.120 align:start position:0%
teens and their children or
 
06:34:58.868 --> 06:34:58.878 align:start position:0%
do it for them because they feel rather
 
06:35:00.310 --> 06:35:00.320 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable and their teenagers don't
 
06:35:01.830 --> 06:35:01.840 align:start position:0%
want to listen to them
 
06:35:04.788 --> 06:35:04.798 align:start position:0%
i've also been asked to speak in at the
 
06:35:07.670 --> 06:35:07.680 align:start position:0%
waldorf school to teach a course on
 
06:35:10.390 --> 06:35:10.400 align:start position:0%
bodily autonomy and sexual reproductive
 
06:35:10.400 --> 06:35:13.430 align:start position:0%
bodily autonomy and sexual reproductive
health

06:35:13.430 --> 06:35:13.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:35:15.590 --> 06:35:15.600 align:start position:0%
studies show that teaching consent does
 
06:35:17.590 --> 06:35:17.600 align:start position:0%
not increase sexual activities in teens
 
06:35:19.030 --> 06:35:19.040 align:start position:0%
that's something that's really important
 
06:35:21.030 --> 06:35:21.040 align:start position:0%
for people to understand because much of
 
06:35:22.868 --> 06:35:22.878 align:start position:0%
the sexual activity is being done under
 
06:35:22.878 --> 06:35:24.468 align:start position:0%
the sexual activity is being done under
pressure

06:35:24.468 --> 06:35:24.478 align:start position:0%
pressure
 
06:35:26.070 --> 06:35:26.080 align:start position:0%
teaching consent would better prepare
 
06:35:28.230 --> 06:35:28.240 align:start position:0%
them to navigate these situations with
 
06:35:28.240 --> 06:35:29.750 align:start position:0%
them to navigate these situations with
confidence

06:35:29.750 --> 06:35:29.760 align:start position:0%
confidence
 
06:35:31.430 --> 06:35:31.440 align:start position:0%
i've also seen the effects of what it is
 
06:35:33.830 --> 06:35:33.840 align:start position:0%
to navigate society without being taught
 
06:35:36.070 --> 06:35:36.080 align:start position:0%
these skills i teach informed consent to
 
06:35:37.990 --> 06:35:38.000 align:start position:0%
my pregnant clients if i've seen too
 
06:35:40.230 --> 06:35:40.240 align:start position:0%
many pregnant women
 
06:35:42.150 --> 06:35:42.160 align:start position:0%
just trying to have some bodily autonomy
 
06:35:43.670 --> 06:35:43.680 align:start position:0%
in the birthing room learning these
 
06:35:45.830 --> 06:35:45.840 align:start position:0%
skills later in life are still good but
 
06:35:47.190 --> 06:35:47.200 align:start position:0%
wouldn't it be better if we didn't have
 
06:35:47.200 --> 06:35:48.708 align:start position:0%
wouldn't it be better if we didn't have
to

06:35:48.708 --> 06:35:48.718 align:start position:0%
to
 
06:35:50.708 --> 06:35:50.718 align:start position:0%
ultimately teaching consent is teaching
 
06:35:52.310 --> 06:35:52.320 align:start position:0%
respect for other people's boundaries
 
06:35:54.948 --> 06:35:54.958 align:start position:0%
and being taught to enforce your own and
 
06:35:56.150 --> 06:35:56.160 align:start position:0%
i believe that's something that we all
 
06:35:57.990 --> 06:35:58.000 align:start position:0%
want for our children
 
06:36:01.510 --> 06:36:01.520 align:start position:0%
thank you for your time
 
06:36:02.788 --> 06:36:02.798 align:start position:0%
one question
 
06:36:04.788 --> 06:36:04.798 align:start position:0%
maybe as uh working in the field here
 
06:36:07.270 --> 06:36:07.280 align:start position:0%
you may have some understanding
 
06:36:09.590 --> 06:36:09.600 align:start position:0%
um three or four years ago we had a bill
 
06:36:11.510 --> 06:36:11.520 align:start position:0%
coming up dealing with discipline in the
 
06:36:11.520 --> 06:36:13.270 align:start position:0%
coming up dealing with discipline in the
schools

06:36:13.270 --> 06:36:13.280 align:start position:0%
schools
 
06:36:16.468 --> 06:36:16.478 align:start position:0%
and the bill read to the fact that
 
06:36:19.270 --> 06:36:19.280 align:start position:0%
a teacher could not touch
 
06:36:22.070 --> 06:36:22.080 align:start position:0%
the student without the student first
 
06:36:24.628 --> 06:36:24.638 align:start position:0%
giving permission
 
06:36:26.628 --> 06:36:26.638 align:start position:0%
we were concerned
 
06:36:29.830 --> 06:36:29.840 align:start position:0%
as a committee yes that
 
06:36:32.070 --> 06:36:32.080 align:start position:0%
if you see two kids scuffling going down
 
06:36:33.910 --> 06:36:33.920 align:start position:0%
to the lunchroom
 
06:36:36.390 --> 06:36:36.400 align:start position:0%
the teacher probably an error if they
 
06:36:38.548 --> 06:36:38.558 align:start position:0%
didn't put the hand on the shoulder of
 
06:36:40.150 --> 06:36:40.160 align:start position:0%
somebody and try and say
 
06:36:42.788 --> 06:36:42.798 align:start position:0%
slow down let's get it together
 
06:36:44.948 --> 06:36:44.958 align:start position:0%
is that then going to be interpretive if
 
06:36:46.230 --> 06:36:46.240 align:start position:0%
the teacher does this and this to
 
06:36:47.990 --> 06:36:48.000 align:start position:0%
happens oftentimes the teacher will walk
 
06:36:50.390 --> 06:36:50.400 align:start position:0%
around the room and put the hand on the
 
06:36:52.390 --> 06:36:52.400 align:start position:0%
shoulder of the kid or
 
06:36:54.628 --> 06:36:54.638 align:start position:0%
or help out you know with peopleship
 
06:36:56.788 --> 06:36:56.798 align:start position:0%
what have you is that a personal
 
06:36:56.798 --> 06:36:58.390 align:start position:0%
what have you is that a personal
boundary

06:36:58.390 --> 06:36:58.400 align:start position:0%
boundary
 
06:37:00.230 --> 06:37:00.240 align:start position:0%
so this is a really good question my
 
06:37:03.910 --> 06:37:03.920 align:start position:0%
mother is a special educator and the um
 
06:37:06.310 --> 06:37:06.320 align:start position:0%
for three school districts in los
 
06:37:06.320 --> 06:37:07.830 align:start position:0%
for three school districts in los
angeles

06:37:07.830 --> 06:37:07.840 align:start position:0%
angeles
 
06:37:10.468 --> 06:37:10.478 align:start position:0%
and she has at times had to restrain
 
06:37:12.390 --> 06:37:12.400 align:start position:0%
children there's been times when someone
 
06:37:14.548 --> 06:37:14.558 align:start position:0%
has you know a second grader
 
06:37:17.190 --> 06:37:17.200 align:start position:0%
has had a pair of scissors and tried to
 
06:37:18.948 --> 06:37:18.958 align:start position:0%
stab another child you know when it
 
06:37:21.430 --> 06:37:21.440 align:start position:0%
comes to safety this happened when it
 
06:37:23.430 --> 06:37:23.440 align:start position:0%
comes to safety this is a completely
 
06:37:25.030 --> 06:37:25.040 align:start position:0%
different matter i don't feel that
 
06:37:26.708 --> 06:37:26.718 align:start position:0%
that's a matter of teaching
 
06:37:28.708 --> 06:37:28.718 align:start position:0%
consent or boundaries you are
 
06:37:30.868 --> 06:37:30.878 align:start position:0%
intervening in a dangerous situation you
 
06:37:32.708 --> 06:37:32.718 align:start position:0%
know and having a fight on the school
 
06:37:34.468 --> 06:37:34.478 align:start position:0%
yard and separating
 
06:37:35.910 --> 06:37:35.920 align:start position:0%
you you are acting
 
06:37:37.750 --> 06:37:37.760 align:start position:0%
in the name of safety that's a
 
06:37:40.390 --> 06:37:40.400 align:start position:0%
completely different thing is
 
06:37:43.750 --> 06:37:43.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:37:45.750 --> 06:37:45.760 align:start position:0%
thank you very much that's where some
 
06:37:47.110 --> 06:37:47.120 align:start position:0%
language yes
 
06:37:49.510 --> 06:37:49.520 align:start position:0%
lawyers love it yes they do they very
 
06:37:50.868 --> 06:37:50.878 align:start position:0%
much do and i guess that's where we'd
 
06:37:52.390 --> 06:37:52.400 align:start position:0%
have to be very careful because i do
 
06:37:53.910 --> 06:37:53.920 align:start position:0%
understand that like on a personal level
 
06:37:55.350 --> 06:37:55.360 align:start position:0%
listening to my mother being a special
 
06:37:57.830 --> 06:37:57.840 align:start position:0%
ed director for three schools
 
06:37:58.948 --> 06:37:58.958 align:start position:0%

06:38:42.948 --> 06:38:42.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:38:45.590 --> 06:38:45.600 align:start position:0%
i am here today to speak in support of
 
06:38:47.990 --> 06:38:48.000 align:start position:0%
hb 1533 regarding the inclusion of
 
06:38:50.070 --> 06:38:50.080 align:start position:0%
consent in the sexual education
 
06:38:50.080 --> 06:38:51.510 align:start position:0%
consent in the sexual education
curriculum

06:38:51.510 --> 06:38:51.520 align:start position:0%
curriculum
 
06:38:53.270 --> 06:38:53.280 align:start position:0%
as a mother of two boys entering their
 
06:38:55.110 --> 06:38:55.120 align:start position:0%
teens this topic is especially relevant
 
06:38:56.788 --> 06:38:56.798 align:start position:0%
to my own family
 
06:38:58.150 --> 06:38:58.160 align:start position:0%
i have always tried to keep
 
06:39:00.548 --> 06:39:00.558 align:start position:0%
communication open and dialogue ongoing
 
06:39:02.150 --> 06:39:02.160 align:start position:0%
in these conversations i've found the
 
06:39:04.230 --> 06:39:04.240 align:start position:0%
aspect of consent to be inextricable
 
06:39:04.240 --> 06:39:05.830 align:start position:0%
aspect of consent to be inextricable
inextricable

06:39:05.830 --> 06:39:05.840 align:start position:0%
inextricable
 
06:39:07.830 --> 06:39:07.840 align:start position:0%
from the broader topic
 
06:39:09.590 --> 06:39:09.600 align:start position:0%
this is my personal experience but to
 
06:39:11.750 --> 06:39:11.760 align:start position:0%
clarify the significance of consent and
 
06:39:13.270 --> 06:39:13.280 align:start position:0%
sexual education i'd like to quote some
 
06:39:15.670 --> 06:39:15.680 align:start position:0%
folks far smarter than i am
 
06:39:17.750 --> 06:39:17.760 align:start position:0%
just about a year ago boston university
 
06:39:19.030 --> 06:39:19.040 align:start position:0%
school of law published a paper
 
06:39:20.548 --> 06:39:20.558 align:start position:0%
discussing the results of various
 
06:39:22.868 --> 06:39:22.878 align:start position:0%
studies regarding consent in sex
 
06:39:22.878 --> 06:39:24.390 align:start position:0%
studies regarding consent in sex
education

06:39:24.390 --> 06:39:24.400 align:start position:0%
education
 
06:39:26.390 --> 06:39:26.400 align:start position:0%
um and so now i'm quoting from them from
 
06:39:29.430 --> 06:39:29.440 align:start position:0%
this paper consent is not i mean sex is
 
06:39:32.468 --> 06:39:32.478 align:start position:0%
not sex without consent it's rape
 
06:39:35.510 --> 06:39:35.520 align:start position:0%
a columbia university uh indica study
 
06:39:37.510 --> 06:39:37.520 align:start position:0%
indicated that those who receive
 
06:39:39.430 --> 06:39:39.440 align:start position:0%
training and how to refuse sexual
 
06:39:41.910 --> 06:39:41.920 align:start position:0%
advances were less likely to be sexually
 
06:39:44.310 --> 06:39:44.320 align:start position:0%
assaulted in college equipping students
 
06:39:45.830 --> 06:39:45.840 align:start position:0%
with the ability to set their own
 
06:39:47.830 --> 06:39:47.840 align:start position:0%
boundaries is important but teaching
 
06:39:50.150 --> 06:39:50.160 align:start position:0%
students to recognize and respect those
 
06:39:51.830 --> 06:39:51.840 align:start position:0%
boundaries and others is just as
 
06:39:54.948 --> 06:39:54.958 align:start position:0%
necessary to prevent sexual uh violence
 
06:39:56.788 --> 06:39:56.798 align:start position:0%
merely giving students the tools to help
 
06:39:58.468 --> 06:39:58.478 align:start position:0%
them potentially get out of a situation
 
06:40:00.310 --> 06:40:00.320 align:start position:0%
they don't want to be in is not enough
 
06:40:01.750 --> 06:40:01.760 align:start position:0%
because it does not express the
 
06:40:04.070 --> 06:40:04.080 align:start position:0%
importance of consent in sexual
 
06:40:06.548 --> 06:40:06.558 align:start position:0%
interactions as long as people fail to
 
06:40:09.030 --> 06:40:09.040 align:start position:0%
recognize and respect the consent of
 
06:40:10.310 --> 06:40:10.320 align:start position:0%
others there will always be
 
06:40:12.868 --> 06:40:12.878 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable or dangerous situations to
 
06:40:15.510 --> 06:40:15.520 align:start position:0%
try to get out of it's mopping up water
 
06:40:17.270 --> 06:40:17.280 align:start position:0%
from the overflowing sink without
 
06:40:19.110 --> 06:40:19.120 align:start position:0%
turning off the tap
 
06:40:20.708 --> 06:40:20.718 align:start position:0%
continuing on they say for younger
 
06:40:22.628 --> 06:40:22.638 align:start position:0%
children consent education reassures
 
06:40:24.548 --> 06:40:24.558 align:start position:0%
them that they have a say in what
 
06:40:26.788 --> 06:40:26.798 align:start position:0%
happens to their bodies something many
 
06:40:29.030 --> 06:40:29.040 align:start position:0%
children are not aware of and it teaches
 
06:40:30.948 --> 06:40:30.958 align:start position:0%
them to respect other people's choices
 
06:40:31.990 --> 06:40:32.000 align:start position:0%
as well
 
06:40:34.390 --> 06:40:34.400 align:start position:0%
as students age understanding consent is
 
06:40:35.990 --> 06:40:36.000 align:start position:0%
a concept that allows them to form
 
06:40:38.150 --> 06:40:38.160 align:start position:0%
fundamental understandings of what
 
06:40:40.150 --> 06:40:40.160 align:start position:0%
healthy relationships look like with
 
06:40:41.510 --> 06:40:41.520 align:start position:0%
others look like
 
06:40:44.708 --> 06:40:44.718 align:start position:0%
beyond a reduction in sexual violence
 
06:40:46.948 --> 06:40:46.958 align:start position:0%
and misconduct these are important life
 
06:40:49.750 --> 06:40:49.760 align:start position:0%
skills that reach far beyond sexual
 
06:40:49.760 --> 06:40:51.110 align:start position:0%
skills that reach far beyond sexual
situations

06:40:51.110 --> 06:40:51.120 align:start position:0%
situations
 
06:40:53.030 --> 06:40:53.040 align:start position:0%
clearly teaching about consent and
 
06:40:55.110 --> 06:40:55.120 align:start position:0%
physical boundaries is important it's
 
06:40:56.868 --> 06:40:56.878 align:start position:0%
essential and i hope that you will all
 
06:40:59.350 --> 06:40:59.360 align:start position:0%
vote in support of this addition to the
 
06:41:01.510 --> 06:41:01.520 align:start position:0%

as an example people with autism
 
06:42:26.788 --> 06:42:26.798 align:start position:0%
have particular social
 
06:42:29.430 --> 06:42:29.440 align:start position:0%
deficits that make it difficult for them
 
06:42:32.788 --> 06:42:32.798 align:start position:0%
to understand the intentions of others
 
06:42:35.190 --> 06:42:35.200 align:start position:0%

06:42:37.750 --> 06:42:37.760 align:start position:0%
theory of mind understanding what other
 
06:42:39.590 --> 06:42:39.600 align:start position:0%
people are thinking
 
06:42:41.190 --> 06:42:41.200 align:start position:0%
and feeling
 
06:42:43.830 --> 06:42:43.840 align:start position:0%
as a result they often get in some
 
06:42:46.390 --> 06:42:46.400 align:start position:0%
trouble sometimes in middle school and
 
06:42:48.548 --> 06:42:48.558 align:start position:0%
high school and at the college level as
 
06:42:48.558 --> 06:42:49.350 align:start position:0%
high school and at the college level as
well

06:42:49.350 --> 06:42:49.360 align:start position:0%
well
 
06:42:51.230 --> 06:42:51.240 align:start position:0%
the trouble they get into is
 
06:42:53.190 --> 06:42:53.200 align:start position:0%
misunderstanding the intentions of
 
06:42:54.548 --> 06:42:54.558 align:start position:0%
others and so
 
06:42:57.430 --> 06:42:57.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:43:00.310 --> 06:43:00.320 align:start position:0%
a girl in school is nice to a boy and
 
06:43:02.468 --> 06:43:02.478 align:start position:0%
the boy misunderstands and starts to
 
06:43:05.510 --> 06:43:05.520 align:start position:0%
follow that girl around and pursues her
 
06:43:07.750 --> 06:43:07.760 align:start position:0%
aggressively this leads to problems in
 
06:43:09.910 --> 06:43:09.920 align:start position:0%
the school often i get called in to sort
 
06:43:11.270 --> 06:43:11.280 align:start position:0%
of unpack
 
06:43:12.548 --> 06:43:12.558 align:start position:0%
and explain
 
06:43:15.110 --> 06:43:15.120 align:start position:0%
what is happening in all of these cases
 
06:43:18.390 --> 06:43:18.400 align:start position:0%
what we do is we teach consent skills to
 
06:43:20.788 --> 06:43:20.798 align:start position:0%
the student to the student who's gotten
 
06:43:24.788 --> 06:43:24.798 align:start position:0%
into trouble this is amazingly effective
 
06:43:28.390 --> 06:43:28.400 align:start position:0%
and it's very easy to do we simply teach
 
06:43:31.430 --> 06:43:31.440 align:start position:0%
the student how to obtain consent at
 
06:43:34.150 --> 06:43:34.160 align:start position:0%
every level of advancement
 
06:43:34.160 --> 06:43:35.270 align:start position:0%
every level of advancement
simply

06:43:35.270 --> 06:43:35.280 align:start position:0%
simply
 
06:43:37.990 --> 06:43:38.000 align:start position:0%
is this okay is it okay if i ask you out
 
06:43:40.070 --> 06:43:40.080 align:start position:0%
is it okay if i follow you to your
 
06:43:42.390 --> 06:43:42.400 align:start position:0%
cheerleader practice is it okay if i
 
06:43:44.230 --> 06:43:44.240 align:start position:0%
take your hand
 
06:43:44.240 --> 06:43:45.350 align:start position:0%
take your hand
simply

06:43:45.350 --> 06:43:45.360 align:start position:0%
simply
 
06:43:47.350 --> 06:43:47.360 align:start position:0%
getting consent at every level of
 
06:43:49.670 --> 06:43:49.680 align:start position:0%
romantic advancement
 
06:43:51.590 --> 06:43:51.600 align:start position:0%
when we teach those simple consent
 
06:43:54.830 --> 06:43:54.840 align:start position:0%
skills those kids no longer get into
 
06:43:57.430 --> 06:43:57.440 align:start position:0%
trouble as we were doing this for years
 
06:43:59.510 --> 06:43:59.520 align:start position:0%
we started to realize that this was
 
06:44:02.150 --> 06:44:02.160 align:start position:0%
probably a good idea to teach other
 
06:44:04.628 --> 06:44:04.638 align:start position:0%
people as well in fact
 
06:44:08.948 --> 06:44:08.958 align:start position:0%
i even teach my friends how to do this
 
06:44:10.708 --> 06:44:10.718 align:start position:0%
and we prevent
 
06:44:13.270 --> 06:44:13.280 align:start position:0%
we prevent these problems and these uh
 
06:44:15.830 --> 06:44:15.840 align:start position:0%
accusations of sexual misconduct
 
06:44:18.708 --> 06:44:18.718 align:start position:0%
tremendously by doing this simple
 
06:44:23.270 --> 06:44:23.280 align:start position:0%
type of consent uh training so um
 
06:44:25.430 --> 06:44:25.440 align:start position:0%
what i want to say oh so one question
 
06:44:27.350 --> 06:44:27.360 align:start position:0%
that some of you may have is why not
 
06:44:29.670 --> 06:44:29.680 align:start position:0%
leave this to families to do this is the
 
06:44:31.190 --> 06:44:31.200 align:start position:0%
sort of thing that maybe families could
 
06:44:34.390 --> 06:44:34.400 align:start position:0%
do and i agree wouldn't that be nice if
 
06:44:35.910 --> 06:44:35.920 align:start position:0%
families did that
 
06:44:37.990 --> 06:44:38.000 align:start position:0%
i don't know about you but my parents
 
06:44:40.548 --> 06:44:40.558 align:start position:0%
never did that with me they didn't teach
 
06:44:40.558 --> 06:44:41.670 align:start position:0%
never did that with me they didn't teach
me

06:44:41.670 --> 06:44:41.680 align:start position:0%
me
 
06:44:43.590 --> 06:44:43.600 align:start position:0%
those things
 
06:44:46.788 --> 06:44:46.798 align:start position:0%
at least not in those in those ways so
 
06:44:48.788 --> 06:44:48.798 align:start position:0%
if we teach the simple skill to our
 
06:44:50.788 --> 06:44:50.798 align:start position:0%
children we'll prevent scores of
 
06:44:52.390 --> 06:44:52.400 align:start position:0%
problems from occurring
 
06:44:54.468 --> 06:44:54.478 align:start position:0%
and it could be your own kid it could be
 
06:44:56.788 --> 06:44:56.798 align:start position:0%
your for a lot of state legislators your
 
06:44:59.590 --> 06:44:59.600 align:start position:0%
grandchild perhaps from being accused of
 
06:45:01.990 --> 06:45:02.000 align:start position:0%
misconduct or for getting in in this
 
06:45:03.270 --> 06:45:03.280 align:start position:0%
sort of trouble
 
06:45:03.280 --> 06:45:04.150 align:start position:0%
sort of trouble

06:45:25.430 --> 06:45:25.440 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
06:45:27.190 --> 06:45:27.200 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
06:45:27.200 --> 06:45:28.548 align:start position:0%
taking my question
um

06:45:28.548 --> 06:45:28.558 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:45:31.510 --> 06:45:31.520 align:start position:0%
i i did teach consent back in like the
 
06:45:34.310 --> 06:45:34.320 align:start position:0%
80s and 90s and sex ed
 
06:45:35.990 --> 06:45:36.000 align:start position:0%
and i found
 
06:45:38.788 --> 06:45:38.798 align:start position:0%
it very striking to me
 
06:45:38.798 --> 06:45:39.670 align:start position:0%
it very striking to me
that

06:45:39.670 --> 06:45:39.680 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:45:42.230 --> 06:45:42.240 align:start position:0%
even people who don't have autism
 
06:45:44.628 --> 06:45:44.638 align:start position:0%
are very confused kids are very confused
 
06:45:46.310 --> 06:45:46.320 align:start position:0%
and i was wondering
 
06:45:48.390 --> 06:45:48.400 align:start position:0%
what i know drugs and alcohol were part
 
06:45:50.230 --> 06:45:50.240 align:start position:0%
of it and certainly the popular culture
 
06:45:52.390 --> 06:45:52.400 align:start position:0%
was part of it but
 
06:45:54.230 --> 06:45:54.240 align:start position:0%
is there a
 
06:45:55.910 --> 06:45:55.920 align:start position:0%
have you found
 
06:45:58.468 --> 06:45:58.478 align:start position:0%
uh different reasons why
 
06:46:01.270 --> 06:46:01.280 align:start position:0%
uh certain people are really
 
06:46:04.548 --> 06:46:04.558 align:start position:0%
so confused about consent and and how
 
06:46:06.310 --> 06:46:06.320 align:start position:0%
how it can happen
 
06:46:08.150 --> 06:46:08.160 align:start position:0%
that um
 
06:46:11.350 --> 06:46:11.360 align:start position:0%
for example in my class i had a girl who
 
06:46:13.510 --> 06:46:13.520 align:start position:0%
had suffered incest for years and didn't
 
06:46:15.510 --> 06:46:15.520 align:start position:0%
realize it until we did this in in the
 
06:46:17.670 --> 06:46:17.680 align:start position:0%
class it was very striking
 
06:46:21.030 --> 06:46:21.040 align:start position:0%
um how that would how that occurs that
 
06:46:21.040 --> 06:46:21.910 align:start position:0%
um how that would how that occurs that
they

06:46:21.910 --> 06:46:21.920 align:start position:0%
they
 
06:46:21.920 --> 06:46:22.788 align:start position:0%
they
they

06:46:22.788 --> 06:46:22.798 align:start position:0%
they
 
06:46:25.590 --> 06:46:25.600 align:start position:0%
you know the confusion with consent i
 
06:46:27.510 --> 06:46:27.520 align:start position:0%
think other than you're autistic
 
06:46:29.270 --> 06:46:29.280 align:start position:0%
that's an excellent question i think you
 
06:46:31.510 --> 06:46:31.520 align:start position:0%
know just like autism occurs on a
 
06:46:31.520 --> 06:46:32.788 align:start position:0%
know just like autism occurs on a
spectrum

06:46:32.788 --> 06:46:32.798 align:start position:0%
spectrum
 
06:46:35.190 --> 06:46:35.200 align:start position:0%
so do social skills in general you know
 
06:46:37.270 --> 06:46:37.280 align:start position:0%
some of us are better than others at
 
06:46:37.280 --> 06:46:38.868 align:start position:0%
some of us are better than others at
this

06:46:38.868 --> 06:46:38.878 align:start position:0%
this
 
06:46:40.230 --> 06:46:40.240 align:start position:0%
hey i'm talking to a bunch of state
 
06:46:42.468 --> 06:46:42.478 align:start position:0%
legislators some of you tend to talk at
 
06:46:43.990 --> 06:46:44.000 align:start position:0%
people rather than with people but
 
06:46:45.750 --> 06:46:45.760 align:start position:0%
that's the nature of the
 
06:46:48.708 --> 06:46:48.718 align:start position:0%
of the job um this requires a very
 
06:46:51.670 --> 06:46:51.680 align:start position:0%
specific tuning into what other people
 
06:46:54.708 --> 06:46:54.718 align:start position:0%
are doing their eyes how their eyes are
 
06:46:57.990 --> 06:46:58.000 align:start position:0%
are are moving facial expressions body
 
06:47:01.350 --> 06:47:01.360 align:start position:0%
movements and words that people say
 
06:47:03.590 --> 06:47:03.600 align:start position:0%
and so there's a broad spectrum in terms
 
06:47:06.548 --> 06:47:06.558 align:start position:0%
of people's skills level in picking up
 
06:47:07.910 --> 06:47:07.920 align:start position:0%
on those skills
 
06:47:10.230 --> 06:47:10.240 align:start position:0%
but if we teach people to and why would
 
06:47:12.310 --> 06:47:12.320 align:start position:0%
we expect anyone to be a good mind
 
06:47:16.150 --> 06:47:16.160 align:start position:0%
reader right you know so if we say look
 
06:47:18.070 --> 06:47:18.080 align:start position:0%
assume the word assume that you can't
 
06:47:20.788 --> 06:47:20.798 align:start position:0%
read other people's minds then just ask
 
06:47:22.390 --> 06:47:22.400 align:start position:0%
and i think a lot of consent skill
 
06:47:24.230 --> 06:47:24.240 align:start position:0%
training is just it's very simple it's
 
06:47:28.390 --> 06:47:28.400 align:start position:0%
just asking people
 
06:47:31.510 --> 06:47:31.520 align:start position:0%
thank you representative mullen
 
06:47:33.590 --> 06:47:33.600 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and i'm over here
 
06:47:35.590 --> 06:47:35.600 align:start position:0%
behind the speaker representative
 
06:47:35.600 --> 06:47:37.510 align:start position:0%

06:47:37.510 --> 06:47:37.520 align:start position:0%
welkowitz
 
06:47:41.430 --> 06:47:41.440 align:start position:0%
from your professional experience
 
06:47:45.830 --> 06:47:45.840 align:start position:0%
have you found that people confuse
 
06:47:47.830 --> 06:47:47.840 align:start position:0%
no means no
 
06:47:47.840 --> 06:47:48.868 align:start position:0%
no means no
with

06:47:48.868 --> 06:47:48.878 align:start position:0%
with
 
06:47:51.590 --> 06:47:51.600 align:start position:0%
the aspect of consent
 
06:47:54.628 --> 06:47:54.638 align:start position:0%
and what i'm asking is because i think i
 
06:47:56.708 --> 06:47:56.718 align:start position:0%
know i was guilty of it myself with my
 
06:47:59.510 --> 06:47:59.520 align:start position:0%
own daughter that because she was
 
06:47:59.520 --> 06:48:01.030 align:start position:0%
own daughter that because she was
assertive

06:48:01.030 --> 06:48:01.040 align:start position:0%
assertive
 
06:48:03.590 --> 06:48:03.600 align:start position:0%
i felt like she had all bases covered
 
06:48:05.350 --> 06:48:05.360 align:start position:0%
because i figured she would just knock
 
06:48:07.750 --> 06:48:07.760 align:start position:0%
somebody's block off if they came nearer
 
06:48:09.190 --> 06:48:09.200 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
06:48:11.350 --> 06:48:11.360 align:start position:0%
and the answer was no
 
06:48:14.468 --> 06:48:14.478 align:start position:0%
but there's more to consent am i correct
 
06:48:16.548 --> 06:48:16.558 align:start position:0%
than just no
 
06:48:18.150 --> 06:48:18.160 align:start position:0%
yeah there
 
06:48:21.270 --> 06:48:21.280 align:start position:0%
there is more than just no and you know
 
06:48:23.910 --> 06:48:23.920 align:start position:0%
getting back to your point i think one
 
06:48:26.390 --> 06:48:26.400 align:start position:0%
i have to say parenthetically that
 
06:48:28.390 --> 06:48:28.400 align:start position:0%
let's face it we have a generation of
 
06:48:30.788 --> 06:48:30.798 align:start position:0%
kids who are who are being exposed to
 
06:48:33.670 --> 06:48:33.680 align:start position:0%
pornography and things like that where
 
06:48:35.830 --> 06:48:35.840 align:start position:0%
they're getting really strange messages
 
06:48:38.548 --> 06:48:38.558 align:start position:0%
about romantic
 
06:48:40.788 --> 06:48:40.798 align:start position:0%
behavior because pornography is not does
 
06:48:42.390 --> 06:48:42.400 align:start position:0%
not equal romantic
 
06:48:43.990 --> 06:48:44.000 align:start position:0%
behavior so i think that also
 
06:48:46.868 --> 06:48:46.878 align:start position:0%
contributes to this idea in terms of
 
06:48:50.468 --> 06:48:50.478 align:start position:0%
romantic activities what know
 
06:48:51.910 --> 06:48:51.920 align:start position:0%
what no means because they're seeing a
 
06:48:53.350 --> 06:48:53.360 align:start position:0%
very different thing
 
06:48:55.830 --> 06:48:55.840 align:start position:0%
uh in social media and
 
06:48:55.840 --> 06:48:56.628 align:start position:0%
uh in social media and
and

06:48:56.628 --> 06:48:56.638 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:48:59.430 --> 06:48:59.440 align:start position:0%
online pornography but yeah i think and
 
06:49:01.510 --> 06:49:01.520 align:start position:0%
assertive behavior is good we want to
 
06:49:03.830 --> 06:49:03.840 align:start position:0%
teach people to be able to tell people
 
06:49:05.510 --> 06:49:05.520 align:start position:0%
what they need and what they want and to
 
06:49:08.150 --> 06:49:08.160 align:start position:0%
be persistent i think that probably is a
 
06:49:10.310 --> 06:49:10.320 align:start position:0%
positive factor but then i think when
 
06:49:13.190 --> 06:49:13.200 align:start position:0%
you add this one extra layer of um
 
06:49:15.510 --> 06:49:15.520 align:start position:0%
teaching everyone
 
06:49:15.520 --> 06:49:16.628 align:start position:0%
teaching everyone
that

06:49:16.628 --> 06:49:16.638 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:49:19.510 --> 06:49:19.520 align:start position:0%
no means no and that you must obtain
 
06:49:21.030 --> 06:49:21.040 align:start position:0%
consent at every level i think that's
 
06:49:23.110 --> 06:49:23.120 align:start position:0%
the point of uh amanda tolle's
 
06:49:25.830 --> 06:49:25.840 align:start position:0%
legislation really is that is that if
 
06:49:27.430 --> 06:49:27.440 align:start position:0%
everyone knows
 
06:49:29.670 --> 06:49:29.680 align:start position:0%
that at every level if someone says no
 
06:49:31.350 --> 06:49:31.360 align:start position:0%
then you stop then we're going to
 
06:49:35.030 --> 06:49:35.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:49:37.030 --> 06:49:37.040 align:start position:0%
thank you very much i have a question
 
06:49:38.628 --> 06:49:38.638 align:start position:0%
for you representative
 
06:49:38.638 --> 06:49:39.430 align:start position:0%
for you representative
um

06:49:39.430 --> 06:49:39.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:49:42.150 --> 06:49:42.160 align:start position:0%
this this uh change to the statute comes
 
06:49:45.270 --> 06:49:45.280 align:start position:0%
underneath health education instruction
 
06:49:47.350 --> 06:49:47.360 align:start position:0%
and as a
 
06:49:49.990 --> 06:49:50.000 align:start position:0%
intermediate school principal for years
 
06:49:51.510 --> 06:49:51.520 align:start position:0%
grades four through
 
06:49:53.350 --> 06:49:53.360 align:start position:0%
right up through grade eight at times
 
06:49:54.708 --> 06:49:54.718 align:start position:0%
through six
 
06:49:54.718 --> 06:49:55.830 align:start position:0%
through six
um

06:49:55.830 --> 06:49:55.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:49:58.548 --> 06:49:58.558 align:start position:0%
we dealt with uh this area of health
 
06:49:58.558 --> 06:50:00.390 align:start position:0%
we dealt with uh this area of health
education

06:50:00.390 --> 06:50:00.400 align:start position:0%
education
 
06:50:02.788 --> 06:50:02.798 align:start position:0%
but it was you know conveyed to us by
 
06:50:05.830 --> 06:50:05.840 align:start position:0%
parents i don't want a person
 
06:50:09.110 --> 06:50:09.120 align:start position:0%
of the opposite gender working or
 
06:50:11.590 --> 06:50:11.600 align:start position:0%
working with my child and
 
06:50:13.270 --> 06:50:13.280 align:start position:0%
and so
 
06:50:13.280 --> 06:50:14.468 align:start position:0%
and so
um

06:50:14.468 --> 06:50:14.478 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:50:16.948 --> 06:50:16.958 align:start position:0%
we had a school nurse that happened to
 
06:50:18.788 --> 06:50:18.798 align:start position:0%
be she was wonderful
 
06:50:20.628 --> 06:50:20.638 align:start position:0%
and we had a pe teacher that all the
 
06:50:22.468 --> 06:50:22.478 align:start position:0%
years and there's several te teachers
 
06:50:23.750 --> 06:50:23.760 align:start position:0%
laying around here
 
06:50:25.670 --> 06:50:25.680 align:start position:0%
uh that were
 
06:50:27.910 --> 06:50:27.920 align:start position:0%
was very good with and knew all the boys
 
06:50:29.750 --> 06:50:29.760 align:start position:0%
there was a wonderful relationship so we
 
06:50:31.670 --> 06:50:31.680 align:start position:0%
went that way especially with the kids
 
06:50:33.030 --> 06:50:33.040 align:start position:0%
in grades
 
06:50:34.628 --> 06:50:34.638 align:start position:0%
five and six
 
06:50:34.638 --> 06:50:35.750 align:start position:0%
five and six
um

06:50:35.750 --> 06:50:35.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:50:36.948 --> 06:50:36.958 align:start position:0%
how who
 
06:50:39.750 --> 06:50:39.760 align:start position:0%
how in your experience who has done this
 
06:50:41.510 --> 06:50:41.520 align:start position:0%
who has done this instruction are
 
06:50:44.548 --> 06:50:44.558 align:start position:0%
schools having to go find a
 
06:50:46.868 --> 06:50:46.878 align:start position:0%
professional like yourself or do they
 
06:50:49.270 --> 06:50:49.280 align:start position:0%
find a school nurse or do they how do
 
06:50:52.150 --> 06:50:52.160 align:start position:0%
they convey this this need
 
06:50:54.310 --> 06:50:54.320 align:start position:0%
to the kids you know a lot of parents i
 
06:50:55.990 --> 06:50:56.000 align:start position:0%
got my instruction my father when we
 
06:50:57.270 --> 06:50:57.280 align:start position:0%
were looking at the university of maine
 
06:50:59.590 --> 06:50:59.600 align:start position:0%
to go to school there a little late
 
06:51:02.310 --> 06:51:02.320 align:start position:0%
um yeah so
 
06:51:04.230 --> 06:51:04.240 align:start position:0%
so i won't tell you what my father told
 
06:51:06.230 --> 06:51:06.240 align:start position:0%
me well probably nothing if they're like
 
06:51:06.240 --> 06:51:06.948 align:start position:0%
me well probably nothing if they're like
mine

06:51:06.948 --> 06:51:06.958 align:start position:0%
mine
 
06:51:11.190 --> 06:51:11.200 align:start position:0%
so um but anyway uh rep how can you help
 
06:51:13.430 --> 06:51:13.440 align:start position:0%
me out with uh who do we use for this
 
06:51:15.670 --> 06:51:15.680 align:start position:0%
instruction is there a special training
 
06:51:17.670 --> 06:51:17.680 align:start position:0%
or what i think there's some training
 
06:51:19.670 --> 06:51:19.680 align:start position:0%
and there are materials that are now
 
06:51:21.910 --> 06:51:21.920 align:start position:0%
widely available that are helpful and i
 
06:51:24.390 --> 06:51:24.400 align:start position:0%
do think uh that that wiggle room that
 
06:51:26.868 --> 06:51:26.878 align:start position:0%
was talked about previously
 
06:51:26.878 --> 06:51:28.150 align:start position:0%
was talked about previously
matters

06:51:28.150 --> 06:51:28.160 align:start position:0%
matters
 
06:51:30.230 --> 06:51:30.240 align:start position:0%
to some extent too there are materials
 
06:51:31.750 --> 06:51:31.760 align:start position:0%
out there but i don't think it's
 
06:51:33.510 --> 06:51:33.520 align:start position:0%
complicated and i
 
06:51:35.590 --> 06:51:35.600 align:start position:0%
i agree with you that the relationship
 
06:51:39.190 --> 06:51:39.200 align:start position:0%
matters that the kids have to uh believe
 
06:51:41.270 --> 06:51:41.280 align:start position:0%
that this person is giving you something
 
06:51:44.070 --> 06:51:44.080 align:start position:0%
that's helpful and that's important and
 
06:51:46.310 --> 06:51:46.320 align:start position:0%
they have to transmit it in a way that
 
06:51:48.230 --> 06:51:48.240 align:start position:0%
is meaningful to you personally that
 
06:51:49.670 --> 06:51:49.680 align:start position:0%
connects with you
 
06:51:52.150 --> 06:51:52.160 align:start position:0%
personally i know you know look a lot of
 
06:51:54.150 --> 06:51:54.160 align:start position:0%
us can remember the gym teacher teaching
 
06:51:54.160 --> 06:51:54.868 align:start position:0%
us can remember the gym teacher teaching
us

06:51:54.868 --> 06:51:54.878 align:start position:0%
us
 
06:51:57.350 --> 06:51:57.360 align:start position:0%
sex education and it not being so great
 
06:51:58.708 --> 06:51:58.718 align:start position:0%
you know
 
06:52:01.190 --> 06:52:01.200 align:start position:0%
but i think that schools are much more
 
06:52:03.110 --> 06:52:03.120 align:start position:0%
kipp to that i think schools have come a
 
06:52:07.030 --> 06:52:07.040 align:start position:0%
long way since when we were kids and i i
 
06:52:08.548 --> 06:52:08.558 align:start position:0%
think they can't find the right people
 
06:52:09.750 --> 06:52:09.760 align:start position:0%
on the ground
 
06:52:11.110 --> 06:52:11.120 align:start position:0%
to do this i don't think you have to
 
06:52:12.788 --> 06:52:12.798 align:start position:0%
bring in outside people it's just not
 
06:52:15.750 --> 06:52:15.760 align:start position:0%
that complicated
 
06:52:17.270 --> 06:52:17.280 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
06:52:17.280 --> 06:52:18.070 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
uh

06:52:18.070 --> 06:52:18.080 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:52:20.628 --> 06:52:20.638 align:start position:0%
yes represent cordelia thank you mr
 
06:52:24.628 --> 06:52:24.638 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for your testimony
 
06:52:26.628 --> 06:52:26.638 align:start position:0%
is this intended
 
06:52:27.750 --> 06:52:27.760 align:start position:0%
to be
 
06:52:29.350 --> 06:52:29.360 align:start position:0%
part of
 
06:52:29.360 --> 06:52:30.948 align:start position:0%
part of
existing

06:52:30.948 --> 06:52:30.958 align:start position:0%
existing
 
06:52:34.310 --> 06:52:34.320 align:start position:0%
curriculum are we talking new curriculum
 
06:52:36.948 --> 06:52:36.958 align:start position:0%
it has to be developed
 
06:52:39.430 --> 06:52:39.440 align:start position:0%
no i think it just fits right in i think
 
06:52:41.190 --> 06:52:41.200 align:start position:0%
it slides right in with current health
 
06:52:44.230 --> 06:52:44.240 align:start position:0%
education okay i was getting uh some
 
06:52:46.468 --> 06:52:46.478 align:start position:0%
mixed messages about whether it was
 
06:52:49.190 --> 06:52:49.200 align:start position:0%
part of existing courses or
 
06:52:51.750 --> 06:52:51.760 align:start position:0%
something new to be added
 
06:52:54.948 --> 06:52:54.958 align:start position:0%
yeah it it's simple it's not complicated
 
06:52:58.310 --> 06:52:58.320 align:start position:0%
it's pretty small it's not costly
 
06:53:01.670 --> 06:53:01.680 align:start position:0%
at all it's not really a cost
 
06:53:01.680 --> 06:53:03.430 align:start position:0%
at all it's not really a cost
issue

06:53:03.430 --> 06:53:03.440 align:start position:0%
issue
 
06:53:04.868 --> 06:53:04.878 align:start position:0%
and there are people in the community
 
06:53:06.230 --> 06:53:06.240 align:start position:0%
like some of the people who spoke who
 
06:53:08.310 --> 06:53:08.320 align:start position:0%
will speak today or have spoken today
 
06:53:09.910 --> 06:53:09.920 align:start position:0%
who i'm sure will give their time to
 
06:53:13.190 --> 06:53:13.200 align:start position:0%
schools to to help them with this
 
06:53:16.708 --> 06:53:16.718 align:start position:0%

06:53:40.468 --> 06:53:40.478 align:start position:0%
uh good afternoon mr chair and members
 
06:53:41.750 --> 06:53:41.760 align:start position:0%
of the committee
 
06:53:43.430 --> 06:53:43.440 align:start position:0%
my name is pamela keilig and i'm the
 
06:53:45.510 --> 06:53:45.520 align:start position:0%
public policy specialist from the new
 
06:53:47.110 --> 06:53:47.120 align:start position:0%
hampshire coalition against domestic and
 
06:53:48.708 --> 06:53:48.718 align:start position:0%
sexual violence
 
06:53:50.548 --> 06:53:50.558 align:start position:0%
as some of you may know the coalition is
 
06:53:53.110 --> 06:53:53.120 align:start position:0%
the umbrella organization for our 12
 
06:53:55.350 --> 06:53:55.360 align:start position:0%
community-based crisis centers who each
 
06:53:57.030 --> 06:53:57.040 align:start position:0%
year provide free and confidential
 
06:54:00.150 --> 06:54:00.160 align:start position:0%
services to nearly 15 000 survivors of
 
06:54:01.910 --> 06:54:01.920 align:start position:0%
sexual and domestic violence in our
 
06:54:01.920 --> 06:54:03.110 align:start position:0%
sexual and domestic violence in our
state

06:54:03.110 --> 06:54:03.120 align:start position:0%
state
 
06:54:05.350 --> 06:54:05.360 align:start position:0%
i just want to briefly speak in support
 
06:54:08.548 --> 06:54:08.558 align:start position:0%
of hb 1533 and i really appreciate the
 
06:54:11.750 --> 06:54:11.760 align:start position:0%
opportunity to testify today
 
06:54:13.590 --> 06:54:13.600 align:start position:0%
this legislation is critical to
 
06:54:15.270 --> 06:54:15.280 align:start position:0%
interrupting and ending the cycle of
 
06:54:16.948 --> 06:54:16.958 align:start position:0%
violence in new hampshire
 
06:54:18.548 --> 06:54:18.558 align:start position:0%
we know that violence prevention
 
06:54:20.868 --> 06:54:20.878 align:start position:0%
education has an immediate effect on the
 
06:54:22.788 --> 06:54:22.798 align:start position:0%
youth and families that participate in
 
06:54:24.948 --> 06:54:24.958 align:start position:0%
these programs and their ability to get
 
06:54:27.910 --> 06:54:27.920 align:start position:0%
the support that they need often
 
06:54:30.788 --> 06:54:30.798 align:start position:0%
as i think you've heard earlier today
 
06:54:32.788 --> 06:54:32.798 align:start position:0%
after attending these lessons children
 
06:54:35.670 --> 06:54:35.680 align:start position:0%
will disclose abuse to a trusted adult
 
06:54:37.830 --> 06:54:37.840 align:start position:0%
and later our crisis center advocates
 
06:54:39.830 --> 06:54:39.840 align:start position:0%
and educators are able to assist the
 
06:54:41.830 --> 06:54:41.840 align:start position:0%
student victims and their families who
 
06:54:44.310 --> 06:54:44.320 align:start position:0%
engage with the child advocacy centers
 
06:54:46.150 --> 06:54:46.160 align:start position:0%
and through the criminal justice process
 
06:54:48.070 --> 06:54:48.080 align:start position:0%
if that's what they'd like to go
 
06:54:50.150 --> 06:54:50.160 align:start position:0%
because of this education students have
 
06:54:50.160 --> 06:54:51.110 align:start position:0%
because of this education students have
come

06:54:51.110 --> 06:54:51.120 align:start position:0%
come
 
06:54:52.948 --> 06:54:52.958 align:start position:0%
to understand what healthy relationship
 
06:54:55.110 --> 06:54:55.120 align:start position:0%
dynamics look like and learn how to
 
06:54:57.190 --> 06:54:57.200 align:start position:0%
identify unhealthy relationships and
 
06:54:59.590 --> 06:54:59.600 align:start position:0%
grooming behaviors
 
06:55:01.910 --> 06:55:01.920 align:start position:0%
all important skills that will have long
 
06:55:03.990 --> 06:55:04.000 align:start position:0%
lasting impacts on their development as
 
06:55:06.310 --> 06:55:06.320 align:start position:0%
they grow into mature adults
 
06:55:08.868 --> 06:55:08.878 align:start position:0%
what this legislation proposes will only
 
06:55:11.350 --> 06:55:11.360 align:start position:0%
improve our response as a state to
 
06:55:13.590 --> 06:55:13.600 align:start position:0%
ending sexual violence as we continue to
 
06:55:15.830 --> 06:55:15.840 align:start position:0%
maximize our efforts to prevent abuse
 
06:55:18.150 --> 06:55:18.160 align:start position:0%
before it occurs so this is a really
 
06:55:19.910 --> 06:55:19.920 align:start position:0%
critical prevention
 
06:55:22.310 --> 06:55:22.320 align:start position:0%
effort right here
 
06:55:23.430 --> 06:55:23.440 align:start position:0%

testify about this valuable legislation
today

06:57:25.350 --> 06:57:25.360 align:start position:0%
today
 
06:57:27.510 --> 06:57:27.520 align:start position:0%
this bill is about health education and
 
06:57:30.310 --> 06:57:30.320 align:start position:0%
the well-being of new hampshire children
 
06:57:32.390 --> 06:57:32.400 align:start position:0%
preventing sexual violence is key to
 
06:57:34.548 --> 06:57:34.558 align:start position:0%
healthy development
 
06:57:35.990 --> 06:57:36.000 align:start position:0%
we see the importance of smoking
 
06:57:37.670 --> 06:57:37.680 align:start position:0%
prevention education because of the
 
06:57:39.350 --> 06:57:39.360 align:start position:0%
damaging health effects
 
06:57:41.190 --> 06:57:41.200 align:start position:0%
it's important enough to be part of
 
06:57:43.270 --> 06:57:43.280 align:start position:0%
health curriculums
 
06:57:45.270 --> 06:57:45.280 align:start position:0%
the negative health impacts of child
 
06:57:47.670 --> 06:57:47.680 align:start position:0%
sexual abuse and other forms of sexual
 
06:57:49.510 --> 06:57:49.520 align:start position:0%
violence are staggering
 
06:57:51.430 --> 06:57:51.440 align:start position:0%
they include depression
 
06:57:53.430 --> 06:57:53.440 align:start position:0%
post-traumatic stress disorder
 
06:57:56.788 --> 06:57:56.798 align:start position:0%
substance abuse and even suicide
 
06:57:58.390 --> 06:57:58.400 align:start position:0%
brain scans have shown that children who
 
06:57:59.910 --> 06:57:59.920 align:start position:0%
have been abused
 
06:58:01.510 --> 06:58:01.520 align:start position:0%
can have similar changes to the brain as
 
06:58:03.590 --> 06:58:03.600 align:start position:0%
soldiers in combat
 
06:58:05.190 --> 06:58:05.200 align:start position:0%
the pain and suffering and difficulties
 
06:58:07.350 --> 06:58:07.360 align:start position:0%
of having to live with sexual violence
 
06:58:09.110 --> 06:58:09.120 align:start position:0%
not only hurts the individual but
 
06:58:10.788 --> 06:58:10.798 align:start position:0%
families too
 
06:58:12.070 --> 06:58:12.080 align:start position:0%
and this is not to mention the
 
06:58:14.628 --> 06:58:14.638 align:start position:0%
incredible health care costs from that
 
06:58:14.638 --> 06:58:16.310 align:start position:0%
incredible health care costs from that
trauma

06:58:16.310 --> 06:58:16.320 align:start position:0%
trauma
 
06:58:17.830 --> 06:58:17.840 align:start position:0%
not providing education to prevent
 
06:58:20.468 --> 06:58:20.478 align:start position:0%
something so profoundly impactful
 
06:58:23.510 --> 06:58:23.520 align:start position:0%
can be devastating to our communities
 
06:58:25.030 --> 06:58:25.040 align:start position:0%
this is especially important in new
 
06:58:25.040 --> 06:58:26.468 align:start position:0%
this is especially important in new
hampshire

06:58:26.468 --> 06:58:26.478 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
06:58:28.708 --> 06:58:28.718 align:start position:0%
where one in four women and one in 20
 
06:58:30.150 --> 06:58:30.160 align:start position:0%
men have reported being sexually
 
06:58:30.160 --> 06:58:32.390 align:start position:0%
men have reported being sexually
assaulted

06:58:32.390 --> 06:58:32.400 align:start position:0%
assaulted
 
06:58:35.270 --> 06:58:35.280 align:start position:0%
what is particularly horrifying
 
06:58:36.830 --> 06:58:36.840 align:start position:0%
is of those
 
06:58:40.468 --> 06:58:40.478 align:start position:0%
reported 41 of sexual assaults against
 
06:58:42.548 --> 06:58:42.558 align:start position:0%
girls occur occurred before the age of

06:58:44.070 --> 06:58:44.080 align:start position:0%
18.
 
06:58:46.868 --> 06:58:46.878 align:start position:0%
and when you're talking about boys
 
06:58:46.878 --> 06:58:48.150 align:start position:0%
and when you're talking about boys
68

06:58:48.150 --> 06:58:48.160 align:start position:0%
68
 
06:58:50.230 --> 06:58:50.240 align:start position:0%
of sexual assaults committed against
 
06:58:53.110 --> 06:58:53.120 align:start position:0%
boys occurred before the age of 18.
 
06:58:54.948 --> 06:58:54.958 align:start position:0%
it is our responsibility to protect
 
06:58:56.788 --> 06:58:56.798 align:start position:0%
young people in our state
 
06:58:58.788 --> 06:58:58.798 align:start position:0%
and providing adequate education on
 
06:59:00.628 --> 06:59:00.638 align:start position:0%
consent and sexual violence prevention
 
06:59:02.548 --> 06:59:02.558 align:start position:0%
is essential in order to ensure they
 
06:59:05.510 --> 06:59:05.520 align:start position:0%
grow up healthy happy and safe
 
06:59:06.948 --> 06:59:06.958 align:start position:0%
i have been doing sexual violence
 
06:59:08.708 --> 06:59:08.718 align:start position:0%
prevention education in schools for over
 
06:59:10.468 --> 06:59:10.478 align:start position:0%
17 years
 
06:59:12.868 --> 06:59:12.878 align:start position:0%
it is not always the easiest job but is
 
06:59:14.948 --> 06:59:14.958 align:start position:0%
incredibly rewarding
 
06:59:17.270 --> 06:59:17.280 align:start position:0%
i can't count how many times a teen has
 
06:59:19.110 --> 06:59:19.120 align:start position:0%
come up to thank us for doing this
 
06:59:21.670 --> 06:59:21.680 align:start position:0%
education or disclosing that they were a
 
06:59:23.750 --> 06:59:23.760 align:start position:0%
survivor and they were so grateful that
 
06:59:25.590 --> 06:59:25.600 align:start position:0%
we were there
 
06:59:27.110 --> 06:59:27.120 align:start position:0%
or the eighth grade girl who came up to
 
06:59:29.430 --> 06:59:29.440 align:start position:0%
me at the end of the presentation asking
 
06:59:32.230 --> 06:59:32.240 align:start position:0%
if it really really if it i'm sorry if
 
06:59:34.628 --> 06:59:34.638 align:start position:0%
it really really wasn't too late to tell
 
06:59:37.270 --> 06:59:37.280 align:start position:0%
if she could really tell
 
06:59:39.030 --> 06:59:39.040 align:start position:0%
or the eighth grade boy who disclosed to
 
06:59:41.750 --> 06:59:41.760 align:start position:0%
a guidance counselor after our workshops
 
06:59:43.590 --> 06:59:43.600 align:start position:0%
that he'd be in sec he had been sexually
 
06:59:45.190 --> 06:59:45.200 align:start position:0%
abused by his babysitter when he was
 
06:59:45.200 --> 06:59:46.230 align:start position:0%
abused by his babysitter when he was
younger

06:59:46.230 --> 06:59:46.240 align:start position:0%
younger
 
06:59:48.468 --> 06:59:48.478 align:start position:0%
this boy had been seeing a therapist for
 
06:59:51.510 --> 06:59:51.520 align:start position:0%
years for unresolved anxiety yet the
 
06:59:53.750 --> 06:59:53.760 align:start position:0%
past abuse never came up in all those
 
06:59:53.760 --> 06:59:55.030 align:start position:0%
past abuse never came up in all those
sessions

06:59:55.030 --> 06:59:55.040 align:start position:0%
sessions
 
06:59:57.430 --> 06:59:57.440 align:start position:0%
until he participated in that
 
06:59:59.830 --> 06:59:59.840 align:start position:0%
school-based prevention education he
 
07:00:01.350 --> 07:00:01.360 align:start position:0%
hadn't recognized what had happened to
 
07:00:03.190 --> 07:00:03.200 align:start position:0%
him as abuse because the babysitter was
 
07:00:03.200 --> 07:00:04.468 align:start position:0%
him as abuse because the babysitter was
female

07:00:04.468 --> 07:00:04.478 align:start position:0%
female
 
07:00:06.868 --> 07:00:06.878 align:start position:0%
kids deserve this education it can be a
 
07:00:08.628 --> 07:00:08.638 align:start position:0%
literal lifeline
 
07:00:10.310 --> 07:00:10.320 align:start position:0%
telling someone you have been or are
 
07:00:12.310 --> 07:00:12.320 align:start position:0%
being sexually abused or assaulted is
 
07:00:13.990 --> 07:00:14.000 align:start position:0%
not easy
 
07:00:16.230 --> 07:00:16.240 align:start position:0%
and then not talking about it only makes
 
07:00:18.150 --> 07:00:18.160 align:start position:0%
it that much more difficult and the
 
07:00:20.548 --> 07:00:20.558 align:start position:0%
silencing of victims and survivors can
 
07:00:23.430 --> 07:00:23.440 align:start position:0%
be just as harmful as the abuse itself
 
07:00:25.510 --> 07:00:25.520 align:start position:0%
and kids don't automatically know what's
 
07:00:25.520 --> 07:00:27.350 align:start position:0%
and kids don't automatically know what's
okay

07:00:27.350 --> 07:00:27.360 align:start position:0%
okay
 
07:00:29.110 --> 07:00:29.120 align:start position:0%
social media and the culture at large
 
07:00:32.150 --> 07:00:32.160 align:start position:0%
can send very strange messages
 
07:00:34.628 --> 07:00:34.638 align:start position:0%
about whether you need consent
 
07:00:36.708 --> 07:00:36.718 align:start position:0%
and what a healthy relationship looks
 
07:00:36.718 --> 07:00:37.990 align:start position:0%
and what a healthy relationship looks
like

07:00:37.990 --> 07:00:38.000 align:start position:0%
like
 
07:00:39.990 --> 07:00:40.000 align:start position:0%
they are getting education on these
 
07:00:42.788 --> 07:00:42.798 align:start position:0%
things but in inappropriate and
 
07:00:45.830 --> 07:00:45.840 align:start position:0%
sometimes dangerous ways
 
07:00:47.750 --> 07:00:47.760 align:start position:0%
leaving this type of education to social
 
07:00:51.590 --> 07:00:51.600 align:start position:0%
media influencers and the like is unfair
 
07:00:53.590 --> 07:00:53.600 align:start position:0%
ensuring that there is developmentally
 
07:00:55.910 --> 07:00:55.920 align:start position:0%
appropriate trauma aware education
 
07:00:57.350 --> 07:00:57.360 align:start position:0%
around consent and sexual violence
 
07:00:59.350 --> 07:00:59.360 align:start position:0%
prevention can neutralize some of the
 
07:01:01.590 --> 07:01:01.600 align:start position:0%
toxic media that kids are inundated with
 
07:01:04.548 --> 07:01:04.558 align:start position:0%
on basically a daily basis
 
07:01:06.150 --> 07:01:06.160 align:start position:0%
but what about a parent's comfort in
 
07:01:08.310 --> 07:01:08.320 align:start position:0%
this being taught
 
07:01:09.990 --> 07:01:10.000 align:start position:0%
according to david finkelhor from the
 
07:01:11.670 --> 07:01:11.680 align:start position:0%
crimes against children research center
 
07:01:12.788 --> 07:01:12.798 align:start position:0%
at unh
 
07:01:14.070 --> 07:01:14.080 align:start position:0%
multiple studies have found that
 
07:01:16.788 --> 07:01:16.798 align:start position:0%
parent-child communication improves
 
07:01:18.230 --> 07:01:18.240 align:start position:0%
after involvement in prevention
 
07:01:18.240 --> 07:01:19.750 align:start position:0%
after involvement in prevention
education

07:01:19.750 --> 07:01:19.760 align:start position:0%
education
 
07:01:21.510 --> 07:01:21.520 align:start position:0%
and with that in mind i want to end with
 
07:01:23.910 --> 07:01:23.920 align:start position:0%
a letter haven where i work
 
07:01:27.590 --> 07:01:27.600 align:start position:0%
received from a new hampshire parent
 
07:01:29.350 --> 07:01:29.360 align:start position:0%
my daughter is in second grade and today
 
07:01:30.548 --> 07:01:30.558 align:start position:0%
she came home with her pamphlet and
 
07:01:32.548 --> 07:01:32.558 align:start position:0%
coloring book we went over it and i
 
07:01:34.390 --> 07:01:34.400 align:start position:0%
asked her a lot of questions she was
 
07:01:36.948 --> 07:01:36.958 align:start position:0%
clearly paying attention to you
 
07:01:38.708 --> 07:01:38.718 align:start position:0%
my husband and i both knew when our kids
 
07:01:40.628 --> 07:01:40.638 align:start position:0%
were born that we would fear the same
 
07:01:42.548 --> 07:01:42.558 align:start position:0%
things that happened to us happening to
 
07:01:42.558 --> 07:01:43.910 align:start position:0%
things that happened to us happening to
them

07:01:43.910 --> 07:01:43.920 align:start position:0%
them
 
07:01:45.750 --> 07:01:45.760 align:start position:0%
we were afraid of scaring them by even
 
07:01:47.590 --> 07:01:47.600 align:start position:0%
talking about it would they think the
 
07:01:49.670 --> 07:01:49.680 align:start position:0%
world is an awful place would talking
 
07:01:51.190 --> 07:01:51.200 align:start position:0%
bring back those awful feelings that we
 
07:01:53.030 --> 07:01:53.040 align:start position:0%
remember from our own vastly different
 
07:01:55.030 --> 07:01:55.040 align:start position:0%
traumatic experiences
 
07:01:56.628 --> 07:01:56.638 align:start position:0%
could the years of anxiety that we felt
 
07:01:58.788 --> 07:01:58.798 align:start position:0%
as adolescents transfer to them but if
 
07:02:00.628 --> 07:02:00.638 align:start position:0%
we never talked about it how could we
 
07:02:02.788 --> 07:02:02.798 align:start position:0%
teach them to
 
07:02:04.390 --> 07:02:04.400 align:start position:0%
so we have said many of the same things
 
07:02:06.150 --> 07:02:06.160 align:start position:0%
to our children that you did
 
07:02:08.070 --> 07:02:08.080 align:start position:0%
stressing stressing that their bodies
 
07:02:09.910 --> 07:02:09.920 align:start position:0%
belong only to them
 
07:02:11.830 --> 07:02:11.840 align:start position:0%
teaching about consent and that no
 
07:02:13.190 --> 07:02:13.200 align:start position:0%
matter what
 
07:02:15.110 --> 07:02:15.120 align:start position:0%
they can tell us anything
 
07:02:17.190 --> 07:02:17.200 align:start position:0%
i am so happy that an organization like
 
07:02:18.628 --> 07:02:18.638 align:start position:0%
yours exists
 
07:02:21.590 --> 07:02:21.600 align:start position:0%
thank you for what you are doing
 
07:02:23.910 --> 07:02:23.920 align:start position:0%
and that's the end of that that letter
 
07:02:25.910 --> 07:02:25.920 align:start position:0%
so in in conclusion
 
07:02:28.708 --> 07:02:28.718 align:start position:0%
hb 1533 will help ensure that education
 
07:02:30.070 --> 07:02:30.080 align:start position:0%
on consent and sexual violence
 
07:02:32.548 --> 07:02:32.558 align:start position:0%
prevention is taught in our schools
 
07:02:34.150 --> 07:02:34.160 align:start position:0%
for all those kids and adults who have
 
07:02:36.230 --> 07:02:36.240 align:start position:0%
already suffered and to help our current
 
07:02:38.150 --> 07:02:38.160 align:start position:0%
and future youth live healthier and
 
07:02:39.510 --> 07:02:39.520 align:start position:0%
freer lives
 
07:02:41.590 --> 07:02:41.600 align:start position:0%
thank you very much and thank you for
 
07:02:44.150 --> 07:02:44.160 align:start position:0%
um listening to me thank you very much
 
07:02:47.030 --> 07:02:47.040 align:start position:0%
are there any questions
 
07:02:51.030 --> 07:02:51.040 align:start position:0%
not yes represent lakers
 
07:02:53.990 --> 07:02:54.000 align:start position:0%
thank you can you give me a guess or
 
07:02:57.350 --> 07:02:57.360 align:start position:0%
give us a guess as to how long
 
07:02:59.030 --> 07:02:59.040 align:start position:0%
the instruction
 
07:03:02.070 --> 07:03:02.080 align:start position:0%
takes like how much out of a year's time
 
07:03:05.430 --> 07:03:05.440 align:start position:0%
would be spent on this uh sure i mean it
 
07:03:07.590 --> 07:03:07.600 align:start position:0%
can it can vary you know school to
 
07:03:10.230 --> 07:03:10.240 align:start position:0%
school for for haven and the schools
 
07:03:11.830 --> 07:03:11.840 align:start position:0%
that we go into
 
07:03:13.750 --> 07:03:13.760 align:start position:0%
um for the
 
07:03:16.788 --> 07:03:16.798 align:start position:0%
our kindergarten program is 45 minutes
 
07:03:18.628 --> 07:03:18.638 align:start position:0%
and that's just once a year i mean
 
07:03:20.708 --> 07:03:20.718 align:start position:0%
there's other things that can supplement
 
07:03:23.030 --> 07:03:23.040 align:start position:0%
for us coming in it's just 45 minutes
 
07:03:23.990 --> 07:03:24.000 align:start position:0%
and then
 
07:03:25.910 --> 07:03:25.920 align:start position:0%
first through sixth grade it's an hour
 
07:03:27.670 --> 07:03:27.680 align:start position:0%
long presentation
 
07:03:29.990 --> 07:03:30.000 align:start position:0%
and then um seventh grade it's two
 
07:03:33.350 --> 07:03:33.360 align:start position:0%
sessions and then two one-hour sessions
 
07:03:36.468 --> 07:03:36.478 align:start position:0%
and then eighth grade it is um three
 
07:03:37.990 --> 07:03:38.000 align:start position:0%
one-hour sessions
 
07:03:39.910 --> 07:03:39.920 align:start position:0%
and that's over an entire year
 
07:03:42.468 --> 07:03:42.478 align:start position:0%
thank you very much you're welcome
 
07:03:43.990 --> 07:03:44.000 align:start position:0%
as a follow-up to that do you have a
 
07:03:47.590 --> 07:03:47.600 align:start position:0%
sample curriculum that you use for that
 
07:03:50.548 --> 07:03:50.558 align:start position:0%
yeah we use a curriculum that's based on
 
07:03:52.788 --> 07:03:52.798 align:start position:0%
a lot of different information or a lot
 
07:03:54.948 --> 07:03:54.958 align:start position:0%
of different resources so it's research
 
07:03:54.958 --> 07:03:55.910 align:start position:0%
of different resources so it's research
based

07:03:55.910 --> 07:03:55.920 align:start position:0%
based
 
07:03:58.628 --> 07:03:58.638 align:start position:0%
there are evidence-based curriculums out
 
07:04:01.030 --> 07:04:01.040 align:start position:0%
there as well and we we use a research
 
07:04:04.468 --> 07:04:04.478 align:start position:0%
 
07:04:07.110 --> 07:04:07.120 align:start position:0%
it'd be nice to have some information
 
07:04:08.948 --> 07:04:08.958 align:start position:0%
like that this bill the way it's written
 
07:04:12.150 --> 07:04:12.160 align:start position:0%
goes in effect 60 days after after
 
07:04:14.390 --> 07:04:14.400 align:start position:0%
that's not a lot of time for
 
07:04:16.070 --> 07:04:16.080 align:start position:0%
school districts that gear up with a
 
07:04:16.080 --> 07:04:17.350 align:start position:0%
school districts that gear up with a
curriculum

07:04:17.350 --> 07:04:17.360 align:start position:0%
curriculum
 
07:04:21.670 --> 07:04:21.680 align:start position:0%
in fact and training and inclusive so uh
 
07:04:23.590 --> 07:04:23.600 align:start position:0%
you know if you have something please
 
07:04:25.510 --> 07:04:25.520 align:start position:0%
you know make it available
 
07:04:28.310 --> 07:04:28.320 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah i can i can certainly um yeah
 
07:04:32.788 --> 07:04:32.798 align:start position:0%
follow up and i know for us we we do the
 
07:04:36.310 --> 07:04:36.320 align:start position:0%
actual presentations and we do them free
 
07:04:38.070 --> 07:04:38.080 align:start position:0%
of charge to the schools
 
07:04:40.150 --> 07:04:40.160 align:start position:0%
so that they don't necessarily have to
 
07:04:42.070 --> 07:04:42.080 align:start position:0%
they can just have us come in you're
 
07:04:44.468 --> 07:04:44.478 align:start position:0%
going to come up to colebrook
 
07:04:46.070 --> 07:04:46.080 align:start position:0%
there should be an agent there are there
 
07:04:48.628 --> 07:04:48.638 align:start position:0%
are agencies across the
 
07:04:50.310 --> 07:04:50.320 align:start position:0%
across the state that do this type of
 
07:04:52.548 --> 07:04:52.558 align:start position:0%
education thank you very much any
 
07:04:55.510 --> 07:04:55.520 align:start position:0%
questions further follow-ups thank you
 
07:04:58.788 --> 07:04:58.798 align:start position:0%
 
07:05:00.390 --> 07:05:00.400 align:start position:0%
uh we have a card right here from
 
07:05:04.310 --> 07:05:04.320 align:start position:0%
 
07:05:11.990 --> 07:05:12.000 align:start position:0%
 
07:05:14.150 --> 07:05:14.160 align:start position:0%

um i'm here to talk in support of this
bill

07:05:28.230 --> 07:05:28.240 align:start position:0%
 
07:05:29.830 --> 07:05:29.840 align:start position:0%
throughout my career i've worked at
 
07:05:31.430 --> 07:05:31.440 align:start position:0%
counseling centers at brigham young
 
07:05:34.788 --> 07:05:34.798 align:start position:0%
university in utah brown university
 
07:05:37.830 --> 07:05:37.840 align:start position:0%
and swarthmore college
 
07:05:37.840 --> 07:05:39.430 align:start position:0%
and swarthmore college
undoubtedly

07:05:39.430 --> 07:05:39.440 align:start position:0%
undoubtedly
 
07:05:40.868 --> 07:05:40.878 align:start position:0%
the biggest presenting concern that
 
07:05:42.868 --> 07:05:42.878 align:start position:0%
shows up in a counseling center
 
07:05:44.628 --> 07:05:44.638 align:start position:0%
is related to trauma
 
07:05:46.708 --> 07:05:46.718 align:start position:0%
when i was at brown university i was a
 
07:05:48.788 --> 07:05:48.798 align:start position:0%
transformative practices specialist
 
07:05:50.150 --> 07:05:50.160 align:start position:0%
where i specialized working with
 
07:05:52.708 --> 07:05:52.718 align:start position:0%
students who had caused harm
 
07:05:54.868 --> 07:05:54.878 align:start position:0%
and so i work with students on both ends
 
07:05:57.750 --> 07:05:57.760 align:start position:0%
of the trauma cycle
 
07:06:00.468 --> 07:06:00.478 align:start position:0%
consent is both a
 
07:06:02.150 --> 07:06:02.160 align:start position:0%
teachable skill
 
07:06:04.868 --> 07:06:04.878 align:start position:0%
and it is context dependent
 
07:06:07.110 --> 07:06:07.120 align:start position:0%
which means that there are number of
 
07:06:09.430 --> 07:06:09.440 align:start position:0%
factors that impact the understanding of
 
07:06:09.440 --> 07:06:10.548 align:start position:0%
factors that impact the understanding of
consent

07:06:10.548 --> 07:06:10.558 align:start position:0%
consent
 
07:06:12.948 --> 07:06:12.958 align:start position:0%
and so the ability to tune into that
 
07:06:15.830 --> 07:06:15.840 align:start position:0%
is dependent on those social skills
 
07:06:17.350 --> 07:06:17.360 align:start position:0%
and it's age-appropriate it's
 
07:06:20.150 --> 07:06:20.160 align:start position:0%
developmental it builds on just like
 
07:06:21.510 --> 07:06:21.520 align:start position:0%
learning algebra
 
07:06:23.270 --> 07:06:23.280 align:start position:0%
it builds off of previously learned
 
07:06:27.030 --> 07:06:27.040 align:start position:0%
material and previously learned skills
 
07:06:29.670 --> 07:06:29.680 align:start position:0%
education is a great equalizer
 
07:06:29.680 --> 07:06:30.468 align:start position:0%
education is a great equalizer
and

07:06:30.468 --> 07:06:30.478 align:start position:0%
and
 
07:06:32.708 --> 07:06:32.718 align:start position:0%
the only way that we can help prevent
 
07:06:32.718 --> 07:06:33.750 align:start position:0%
the only way that we can help prevent
harm

07:06:33.750 --> 07:06:33.760 align:start position:0%
harm
 
07:06:35.350 --> 07:06:35.360 align:start position:0%
is through education and through
 
07:06:37.430 --> 07:06:37.440 align:start position:0%
preventative measures
 
07:06:39.030 --> 07:06:39.040 align:start position:0%
preventative measures such as this by
 
07:06:41.510 --> 07:06:41.520 align:start position:0%
teaching consent will go far will have a
 
07:06:43.510 --> 07:06:43.520 align:start position:0%
far broader reach
 
07:06:45.110 --> 07:06:45.120 align:start position:0%
than treatment
 
07:06:48.548 --> 07:06:48.558 align:start position:0%
where after harm has been caused
 
07:06:49.990 --> 07:06:50.000 align:start position:0%
students can be in the counseling center
 
07:06:52.310 --> 07:06:52.320 align:start position:0%
for years and years trying to treat the
 
07:06:52.320 --> 07:06:53.270 align:start position:0%
for years and years trying to treat the
trauma

07:06:53.270 --> 07:06:53.280 align:start position:0%
trauma
 
07:06:55.670 --> 07:06:55.680 align:start position:0%
of what happened whether they caused the
 
07:06:57.430 --> 07:06:57.440 align:start position:0%
trauma or they were the recipient of
 
07:06:57.440 --> 07:06:58.548 align:start position:0%
trauma or they were the recipient of
trauma

07:06:58.548 --> 07:06:58.558 align:start position:0%
trauma
 
07:07:00.708 --> 07:07:00.718 align:start position:0%
and so i am incredibly supportive of
 
07:07:02.548 --> 07:07:02.558 align:start position:0%
this bill and think that it will have
 
07:07:04.548 --> 07:07:04.558 align:start position:0%
far-reaching effects not just for
 
07:07:06.390 --> 07:07:06.400 align:start position:0%
students here in new hampshire
 
07:07:08.390 --> 07:07:08.400 align:start position:0%
but students from new hampshire as they
 
07:07:09.750 --> 07:07:09.760 align:start position:0%
go out to other colleges other
 
07:07:12.070 --> 07:07:12.080 align:start position:0%
universities where they're interacting
 
07:07:13.590 --> 07:07:13.600 align:start position:0%
with people from different cultures
 
07:07:16.390 --> 07:07:16.400 align:start position:0%
people from different regions
 
07:07:18.390 --> 07:07:18.400 align:start position:0%
so i am supportive of this bill and
 
07:07:20.230 --> 07:07:20.240 align:start position:0%
think that it will have a broad reaching
 
07:07:23.030 --> 07:07:23.040 align:start position:0%
effect in preventing trauma and harm
 
07:07:25.510 --> 07:07:25.520 align:start position:0%
thank you very much are there questions
 
07:07:27.830 --> 07:07:27.840 align:start position:0%
yes representative mullen
 
07:07:29.670 --> 07:07:29.680 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
07:07:33.110 --> 07:07:33.120 align:start position:0%
coming to speak to us today
 
07:07:35.670 --> 07:07:35.680 align:start position:0%
from your experience
 
07:07:35.680 --> 07:07:37.590 align:start position:0%
from your experience
with

07:07:37.590 --> 07:07:37.600 align:start position:0%
with
 
07:07:41.510 --> 07:07:41.520 align:start position:0%
individuals who have caused harm
 
07:07:44.468 --> 07:07:44.478 align:start position:0%
what do you think the impact would be on
 
07:07:45.750 --> 07:07:45.760 align:start position:0%
the rate
 
07:07:45.760 --> 07:07:46.708 align:start position:0%
the rate
of

07:07:46.708 --> 07:07:46.718 align:start position:0%
of
 
07:07:49.110 --> 07:07:49.120 align:start position:0%
individuals who cause harm
 
07:07:53.270 --> 07:07:53.280 align:start position:0%
had they been consent trained themselves
 
07:07:56.070 --> 07:07:56.080 align:start position:0%
as as kids
 
07:07:56.080 --> 07:07:57.510 align:start position:0%
as as kids
yeah

07:07:57.510 --> 07:07:57.520 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
07:08:00.548 --> 07:08:00.558 align:start position:0%
yeah so so
 
07:08:00.558 --> 07:08:01.830 align:start position:0%
yeah so so
clinically

07:08:01.830 --> 07:08:01.840 align:start position:0%
clinically
 
07:08:01.840 --> 07:08:02.628 align:start position:0%
clinically
um

07:08:02.628 --> 07:08:02.638 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:08:04.390 --> 07:08:04.400 align:start position:0%
the experience of seeing students who
 
07:08:08.070 --> 07:08:08.080 align:start position:0%
have received uh consent training
 
07:08:11.030 --> 07:08:11.040 align:start position:0%
it greatly reduces the risk of causing
 
07:08:15.350 --> 07:08:15.360 align:start position:0%
harm empirically that's also supported
 
07:08:17.750 --> 07:08:17.760 align:start position:0%
if they do cause harm it tends to be
 
07:08:20.070 --> 07:08:20.080 align:start position:0%
less impactful
 
07:08:22.230 --> 07:08:22.240 align:start position:0%
and perhaps the biggest thing is that it
 
07:08:24.310 --> 07:08:24.320 align:start position:0%
normalizes the fact that consent is a
 
07:08:26.628 --> 07:08:26.638 align:start position:0%
complicated construct
 
07:08:28.708 --> 07:08:28.718 align:start position:0%
that can be learned
 
07:08:31.350 --> 07:08:31.360 align:start position:0%
and is difficult for many people to tune
 
07:08:31.360 --> 07:08:32.230 align:start position:0%
and is difficult for many people to tune
into

07:08:32.230 --> 07:08:32.240 align:start position:0%
into
 
07:08:34.788 --> 07:08:34.798 align:start position:0%
so when people do cause harm they're
 
07:08:36.708 --> 07:08:36.718 align:start position:0%
much more likely to come and ask for
 
07:08:39.270 --> 07:08:39.280 align:start position:0%
help because it reduces shame it reduces
 
07:08:42.390 --> 07:08:42.400 align:start position:0%
stigma around something like consent
 
07:08:44.628 --> 07:08:44.638 align:start position:0%
where we tend to think of relationships
 
07:08:46.788 --> 07:08:46.798 align:start position:0%
as being fairly simple and sexual
 
07:08:48.788 --> 07:08:48.798 align:start position:0%
interactions as being simple but they're
 
07:08:50.548 --> 07:08:50.558 align:start position:0%
incredibly complicated
 
07:08:52.788 --> 07:08:52.798 align:start position:0%
and so this goes a great way to reducing
 
07:08:55.990 --> 07:08:56.000 align:start position:0%
stigma and shame if harm is caused and
 
07:08:58.708 --> 07:08:58.718 align:start position:0%
it does a great deal of effort to reduce
 
07:09:02.548 --> 07:09:02.558 align:start position:0%
 
07:09:04.628 --> 07:09:04.638 align:start position:0%
thank you are there further questions
 
07:09:06.468 --> 07:09:06.478 align:start position:0%
not seeing hands thank you very much
 
07:09:07.590 --> 07:09:07.600 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
07:09:11.830 --> 07:09:11.840 align:start position:0%
 
07:09:14.468 --> 07:09:14.478 align:start position:0%
okay uh we do not have any other pink
 
07:09:17.430 --> 07:09:17.440 align:start position:0%
cards for this bill so i will conclude
 
07:09:19.270 --> 07:09:19.280 align:start position:0%
this hearing
 
07:09:20.708 --> 07:09:20.718 align:start position:0%
and we're going to take about two
 
07:09:22.548 --> 07:09:22.558 align:start position:0%
minutes and then come right back to open
 
07:09:24.070 --> 07:09:24.080 align:start position:0%
up our last hearing
 
07:09:30.150 --> 07:09:30.160 align:start position:0%
 
07:09:32.310 --> 07:09:32.320 align:start position:0%
the last card
 
07:09:35.190 --> 07:09:35.200 align:start position:0%
from mr soto i think he has his phone
 
07:09:37.350 --> 07:09:37.360 align:start position:0%
number reversed there on there
 
07:09:39.990 --> 07:09:40.000 align:start position:0%
if he's from vermont it's 802 it's 802.
 
07:09:42.628 --> 07:09:42.638 align:start position:0%
i'm sure yep i know that would be true
 
07:09:44.070 --> 07:09:44.080 align:start position:0%
and i'm not the one
 
07:09:45.990 --> 07:09:46.000 align:start position:0%
i don't want to embarrass him so i'll
 
07:09:47.750 --> 07:09:47.760 align:start position:0%
just let's just change it
 
07:09:51.670 --> 07:09:51.680 align:start position:0%
good catch mr chair
 
07:09:54.310 --> 07:09:54.320 align:start position:0%
well my vet's over there
 
07:09:56.548 --> 07:09:56.558 align:start position:0%
my kids are over there there are doctors
 
07:09:57.590 --> 07:09:57.600 align:start position:0%
over there
 
07:10:00.868 --> 07:10:00.878 align:start position:0%
207 is maine 802 that's right exactly
 
07:10:07.030 --> 07:10:07.040 align:start position:0%
 
07:10:25.430 --> 07:10:25.440 align:start position:0%
 
07:10:27.030 --> 07:10:27.040 align:start position:0%
we're coming down
 
07:11:55.590 --> 07:11:55.600 align:start position:0%
 
07:12:23.350 --> 07:12:23.360 align:start position:0%
 
07:12:25.270 --> 07:12:25.280 align:start position:0%
that's my stuff
 
07:12:59.110 --> 07:12:59.120 align:start position:0%
 
07:13:01.190 --> 07:13:01.200 align:start position:0%
so i was late this morning to get my
 
07:13:03.510 --> 07:13:03.520 align:start position:0%
comcast cable
 
07:13:03.520 --> 07:13:17.910 align:start position:0%
comcast cable
back

07:13:17.910 --> 07:13:17.920 align:start position:0%
 
07:13:19.270 --> 07:13:19.280 align:start position:0%
i just asked
 
07:13:21.990 --> 07:13:22.000 align:start position:0%
because he's a uh he's a friend and i
 
07:13:23.270 --> 07:13:23.280 align:start position:0%
if i hadn't been here i could have
 
07:13:24.708 --> 07:13:24.718 align:start position:0%
peppered him with a
 
07:13:28.310 --> 07:13:28.320 align:start position:0%
 
07:13:29.430 --> 07:13:29.440 align:start position:0%
i know
 
07:13:49.030 --> 07:13:49.040 align:start position:0%
 
07:14:15.110 --> 07:14:15.120 align:start position:0%
 
07:14:21.830 --> 07:14:21.840 align:start position:0%
 
07:14:24.468 --> 07:14:24.478 align:start position:0%
yeah i hated to miss that
 
07:14:25.590 --> 07:14:25.600 align:start position:0%
because i
 
07:14:31.750 --> 07:14:31.760 align:start position:0%
 
07:14:33.270 --> 07:14:33.280 align:start position:0%
yeah i know that he was
 
07:14:35.510 --> 07:14:35.520 align:start position:0%
hoping to just just done that jasper
 
07:15:08.390 --> 07:15:08.400 align:start position:0%
 
07:15:08.400 --> 07:15:21.510 align:start position:0%
 
earlier

07:15:21.510 --> 07:15:21.520 align:start position:0%
 
07:15:52.868 --> 07:15:52.878 align:start position:0%
 
07:16:18.628 --> 07:16:18.638 align:start position:0%
 
07:16:29.350 --> 07:16:29.360 align:start position:0%
 
07:16:39.510 --> 07:16:39.520 align:start position:0%
 
07:16:42.628 --> 07:16:42.638 align:start position:0%
well that sounds like it's a good thing
 
07:16:45.190 --> 07:16:45.200 align:start position:0%
i think i i'm just
 
07:16:45.200 --> 07:17:00.628 align:start position:0%
i think i i'm just
anticipating

07:17:00.628 --> 07:17:00.638 align:start position:0%
 
07:17:03.030 --> 07:17:03.040 align:start position:0%
the language is presented today
 
07:17:05.350 --> 07:17:05.360 align:start position:0%
it's just why you read the three parts
 
07:17:06.948 --> 07:17:06.958 align:start position:0%
of it that i have questions about
 
07:17:06.958 --> 07:17:09.590 align:start position:0%
of it that i have questions about
definition

07:17:09.590 --> 07:17:09.600 align:start position:0%
 
07:17:11.430 --> 07:17:11.440 align:start position:0%
but i mean as somebody who looks at that
 
07:17:11.440 --> 07:17:13.350 align:start position:0%
but i mean as somebody who looks at that
line

07:17:13.350 --> 07:17:13.360 align:start position:0%
line
 
07:17:14.628 --> 07:17:14.638 align:start position:0%
under the law
 
07:17:16.788 --> 07:17:16.798 align:start position:0%
i don't think there will be any conflict
 
07:17:16.798 --> 07:17:30.468 align:start position:0%
i don't think there will be any conflict
today

07:17:30.468 --> 07:17:30.478 align:start position:0%
 
07:17:43.910 --> 07:17:43.920 align:start position:0%
 
07:17:45.190 --> 07:17:45.200 align:start position:0%
well you know
 
07:17:47.910 --> 07:17:47.920 align:start position:0%
 
07:17:49.910 --> 07:17:49.920 align:start position:0%
i mean the wheels are turning and i know
 
07:17:51.230 --> 07:17:51.240 align:start position:0%
when when i
 
07:17:53.430 --> 07:17:53.440 align:start position:0%
was great
 
07:17:53.440 --> 07:18:35.350 align:start position:0%
was great
so

07:18:35.350 --> 07:18:35.360 align:start position:0%
 
07:18:35.360 --> 07:19:23.110 align:start position:0%
 
yes

07:19:23.110 --> 07:19:23.120 align:start position:0%
 
07:19:25.350 --> 07:19:25.360 align:start position:0%

07:19:57.110 --> 07:19:57.120 align:start position:0%
i grew up
 
07:19:57.120 --> 07:19:58.230 align:start position:0%
i grew up
here

07:19:58.230 --> 07:19:58.240 align:start position:0%
here
 
07:20:00.948 --> 07:20:00.958 align:start position:0%
in concord went to
 
07:20:02.868 --> 07:20:02.878 align:start position:0%
concord public schools
 
07:20:05.110 --> 07:20:05.120 align:start position:0%

07:20:08.080 --> 07:20:10.150 align:start position:0%
school and concord high school
and

07:20:10.150 --> 07:20:10.160 align:start position:0%
and
 
07:20:12.468 --> 07:20:12.478 align:start position:0%
so one thing
 
07:20:14.230 --> 07:20:14.240 align:start position:0%
one thing i heard a lot in the school
 
07:20:14.240 --> 07:20:16.070 align:start position:0%
one thing i heard a lot in the school
system

07:20:16.070 --> 07:20:16.080 align:start position:0%
system
 
07:20:19.510 --> 07:20:19.520 align:start position:0%
growing up was that
 
07:20:19.520 --> 07:20:20.310 align:start position:0%
growing up was that
the

07:20:20.310 --> 07:20:20.320 align:start position:0%
the
 
07:20:22.948 --> 07:20:22.958 align:start position:0%
teachers are trying to
 
07:20:26.628 --> 07:20:26.638 align:start position:0%
 
07:20:28.868 --> 07:20:28.878 align:start position:0%
the workplace for getting a job for what
 
07:20:31.270 --> 07:20:31.280 align:start position:0%
they're going to do when they grow up
 
07:20:31.280 --> 07:20:32.708 align:start position:0%
they're going to do when they grow up
and

07:20:32.708 --> 07:20:32.718 align:start position:0%
and
 
07:20:36.388 --> 07:20:36.398 align:start position:0%
looking back on it one thing that i've
 
07:20:36.398 --> 07:20:38.070 align:start position:0%
looking back on it one thing that i've
realized

07:20:38.070 --> 07:20:38.080 align:start position:0%
realized
 
07:20:38.080 --> 07:20:39.190 align:start position:0%
realized
is

07:20:39.190 --> 07:20:39.200 align:start position:0%
is
 
07:20:39.200 --> 07:20:40.628 align:start position:0%
is
that

07:20:40.628 --> 07:20:40.638 align:start position:0%
that
 
07:20:40.638 --> 07:20:41.830 align:start position:0%
that
um

07:20:41.830 --> 07:20:41.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:20:45.030 --> 07:20:45.040 align:start position:0%
to the extent that they do that
 
07:20:50.548 --> 07:20:50.558 align:start position:0%
 
07:20:52.310 --> 07:20:52.320 align:start position:0%
what exactly
 
07:20:52.320 --> 07:20:53.430 align:start position:0%
what exactly
skills

07:20:53.430 --> 07:20:53.440 align:start position:0%
skills
 
07:20:55.670 --> 07:20:55.680 align:start position:0%
what skills students need to use in the
 
07:20:55.680 --> 07:20:56.868 align:start position:0%
what skills students need to use in the
workplace

07:20:56.868 --> 07:20:56.878 align:start position:0%
workplace
 
07:20:59.030 --> 07:20:59.040 align:start position:0%
a lot of its bias towards the employer's
 
07:21:01.110 --> 07:21:01.120 align:start position:0%
point of view
 
07:21:03.590 --> 07:21:03.600 align:start position:0%
and there's not really
 
07:21:06.708 --> 07:21:06.718 align:start position:0%
as much education from
 
07:21:08.868 --> 07:21:08.878 align:start position:0%
the workers point of view of what sort
 
07:21:08.878 --> 07:21:10.468 align:start position:0%
the workers point of view of what sort
of

07:21:10.468 --> 07:21:10.478 align:start position:0%
of
 
07:21:13.270 --> 07:21:13.280 align:start position:0%
skills they might need to
 
07:21:15.750 --> 07:21:15.760 align:start position:0%
stand up to their boss
 
07:21:15.760 --> 07:21:17.670 align:start position:0%
stand up to their boss
to

07:21:17.670 --> 07:21:17.680 align:start position:0%
to
 
07:21:19.430 --> 07:21:19.440 align:start position:0%
fight for higher wages and better
 
07:21:22.868 --> 07:21:22.878 align:start position:0%
 
07:21:22.878 --> 07:21:24.070 align:start position:0%
 
and

07:21:24.070 --> 07:21:24.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
07:21:24.080 --> 07:21:25.110 align:start position:0%
and
so

07:21:25.110 --> 07:21:25.120 align:start position:0%
so
 
07:21:27.190 --> 07:21:27.200 align:start position:0%
i think
 
07:21:29.590 --> 07:21:29.600 align:start position:0%
i think a way
 
07:21:31.590 --> 07:21:31.600 align:start position:0%
to help
 
07:21:33.590 --> 07:21:33.600 align:start position:0%
students better learn
 
07:21:35.750 --> 07:21:35.760 align:start position:0%
how to do that would be to look at
 
07:21:39.910 --> 07:21:39.920 align:start position:0%
some historical examples of
 
07:21:42.388 --> 07:21:42.398 align:start position:0%
how exactly
 
07:21:46.070 --> 07:21:46.080 align:start position:0%
 
07:21:49.110 --> 07:21:49.120 align:start position:0%
fought for improved
 
07:21:52.548 --> 07:21:52.558 align:start position:0%
uh workplace conditions in the past
 
07:21:52.558 --> 07:21:53.990 align:start position:0%
uh workplace conditions in the past
so

07:21:53.990 --> 07:21:54.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
07:21:55.350 --> 07:21:55.360 align:start position:0%
that's why
 
07:21:57.190 --> 07:21:57.200 align:start position:0%
i decided to
 
07:21:57.200 --> 07:21:58.868 align:start position:0%
i decided to
introduce

07:21:58.868 --> 07:21:58.878 align:start position:0%
introduce
 
07:22:01.190 --> 07:22:01.200 align:start position:0%
this bill to add
 
07:22:03.110 --> 07:22:03.120 align:start position:0%
labor history to
 
07:22:03.120 --> 07:22:06.548 align:start position:0%
labor history to
the

07:22:06.548 --> 07:22:06.558 align:start position:0%
 
07:22:08.388 --> 07:22:08.398 align:start position:0%
to the
 
07:22:11.510 --> 07:22:11.520 align:start position:0%
public schools history curriculum
 
07:22:11.520 --> 07:22:13.670 align:start position:0%
public schools history curriculum
so

07:22:13.670 --> 07:22:13.680 align:start position:0%
so
 
07:22:13.680 --> 07:22:15.590 align:start position:0%
so
um

07:22:15.590 --> 07:22:15.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:22:15.600 --> 07:22:16.388 align:start position:0%
um
so

07:22:16.388 --> 07:22:16.398 align:start position:0%
so
 
07:22:18.468 --> 07:22:18.478 align:start position:0%
it's a pretty simple bill just a few
 
07:22:18.478 --> 07:22:20.948 align:start position:0%
it's a pretty simple bill just a few
lines

07:22:20.948 --> 07:22:20.958 align:start position:0%
 
07:22:23.430 --> 07:22:23.440 align:start position:0%
so um
 
07:22:24.830 --> 07:22:24.840 align:start position:0%
it took
 
07:22:24.840 --> 07:22:26.708 align:start position:0%
it took
um

07:22:26.708 --> 07:22:26.718 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:22:28.948 --> 07:22:28.958 align:start position:0%
it took two drafts
 
07:22:32.230 --> 07:22:32.240 align:start position:0%
 
07:22:34.230 --> 07:22:34.240 align:start position:0%
the one thing i changed was
 
07:22:36.388 --> 07:22:36.398 align:start position:0%
to make sure to specify that this is as
 
07:22:38.628 --> 07:22:38.638 align:start position:0%
part of the standard history curriculum
 
07:22:38.638 --> 07:22:39.350 align:start position:0%
part of the standard history curriculum
like

07:22:39.350 --> 07:22:39.360 align:start position:0%
like
 
07:22:40.468 --> 07:22:40.478 align:start position:0%
it's not
 
07:22:40.478 --> 07:22:41.910 align:start position:0%
it's not
um

07:22:41.910 --> 07:22:41.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:22:44.868 --> 07:22:44.878 align:start position:0%
i'm not saying schools need to
 
07:22:46.708 --> 07:22:46.718 align:start position:0%
create a separate class for it or
 
07:22:46.718 --> 07:22:47.910 align:start position:0%
create a separate class for it or
anything

07:22:47.910 --> 07:22:47.920 align:start position:0%
anything
 
07:22:50.070 --> 07:22:50.080 align:start position:0%
just that
 
07:22:52.830 --> 07:22:52.840 align:start position:0%
they should mention something
 
07:22:55.430 --> 07:22:55.440 align:start position:0%
about labor and
 
07:22:58.708 --> 07:22:58.718 align:start position:0%
their regular history classes
 
07:22:58.718 --> 07:23:01.350 align:start position:0%
their regular history classes
um

07:23:01.350 --> 07:23:01.360 align:start position:0%
 
07:23:01.360 --> 07:23:05.750 align:start position:0%
 
and

07:23:05.750 --> 07:23:05.760 align:start position:0%
 
07:23:08.388 --> 07:23:08.398 align:start position:0%
uh yeah i think that would
 
07:23:10.310 --> 07:23:10.320 align:start position:0%
that would help
 
07:23:13.030 --> 07:23:13.040 align:start position:0%
improve things for students so that way
 
07:23:14.948 --> 07:23:14.958 align:start position:0%
they can know
 
07:23:16.708 --> 07:23:16.718 align:start position:0%
what powers they have when they step
 
07:23:18.150 --> 07:23:18.160 align:start position:0%
into the
 
07:23:18.160 --> 07:23:20.150 align:start position:0%
into the
workplace

07:23:20.150 --> 07:23:20.160 align:start position:0%
workplace
 
07:23:22.708 --> 07:23:22.718 align:start position:0%
from their own point of view rather than
 
07:23:23.830 --> 07:23:23.840 align:start position:0%
just the
 
07:23:26.788 --> 07:23:26.798 align:start position:0%
their employers so
 
07:23:28.708 --> 07:23:28.718 align:start position:0%
that's the bill and i'll take any
 
07:23:28.718 --> 07:23:30.468 align:start position:0%
that's the bill and i'll take any
questions

07:23:30.468 --> 07:23:30.478 align:start position:0%
questions
 
07:23:32.230 --> 07:23:32.240 align:start position:0%
thank you very much representative are
 
07:23:33.590 --> 07:23:33.600 align:start position:0%
there any questions for the
 
07:23:36.070 --> 07:23:36.080 align:start position:0%
representative yes represent cordelia
 
07:23:37.670 --> 07:23:37.680 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman uh thank you
 
07:23:39.670 --> 07:23:39.680 align:start position:0%
representative i was just wondering what
 
07:23:43.350 --> 07:23:43.360 align:start position:0%
you would uh see or what would you see
 
07:23:44.948 --> 07:23:44.958 align:start position:0%
being meant by
 
07:23:48.150 --> 07:23:48.160 align:start position:0%
other labor actions what would
 
07:23:50.388 --> 07:23:50.398 align:start position:0%
be other later labor actions that should
 
07:23:53.270 --> 07:23:53.280 align:start position:0%
be included in straight instruction
 
07:23:57.430 --> 07:23:57.440 align:start position:0%
 
07:24:00.230 --> 07:24:00.240 align:start position:0%
so there's another a number of things
 
07:24:00.240 --> 07:24:02.708 align:start position:0%
so there's another a number of things
that

07:24:02.708 --> 07:24:02.718 align:start position:0%
 
07:24:05.510 --> 07:24:05.520 align:start position:0%
that labor can do
 
07:24:05.520 --> 07:24:07.670 align:start position:0%
that labor can do
um

07:24:07.670 --> 07:24:07.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:24:07.680 --> 07:24:09.830 align:start position:0%
um
in

07:24:09.830 --> 07:24:09.840 align:start position:0%
in
 
07:24:12.628 --> 07:24:12.638 align:start position:0%
in terms of negotiating with management
 
07:24:12.638 --> 07:24:13.590 align:start position:0%
in terms of negotiating with management
like

07:24:13.590 --> 07:24:13.600 align:start position:0%
like
 
07:24:15.270 --> 07:24:15.280 align:start position:0%
you know even just
 
07:24:18.468 --> 07:24:18.478 align:start position:0%
the creation of the whole collective
 
07:24:20.708 --> 07:24:20.718 align:start position:0%
bargaining process in the first place
 
07:24:20.718 --> 07:24:22.230 align:start position:0%
bargaining process in the first place
like

07:24:22.230 --> 07:24:22.240 align:start position:0%
like
 
07:24:22.240 --> 07:24:22.868 align:start position:0%
like
i

07:24:22.868 --> 07:24:22.878 align:start position:0%
i
 
07:24:24.868 --> 07:24:24.878 align:start position:0%
heck i i don't even know how that came
 
07:24:25.990 --> 07:24:26.000 align:start position:0%
to be in the first place that's
 
07:24:30.548 --> 07:24:30.558 align:start position:0%
something i usually i'd like to learn um
 
07:24:33.590 --> 07:24:33.600 align:start position:0%
you know how that got placed into law um
 
07:24:37.190 --> 07:24:37.200 align:start position:0%
and i mentioned strikes um
 
07:24:39.590 --> 07:24:39.600 align:start position:0%
there's other actions that labor can
 
07:24:41.510 --> 07:24:41.520 align:start position:0%
take short of strikes
 
07:24:44.948 --> 07:24:44.958 align:start position:0%
like work to rule for example where
 
07:24:46.868 --> 07:24:46.878 align:start position:0%
you only do the stuff that's
 
07:24:48.948 --> 07:24:48.958 align:start position:0%
specifically mentioned
 
07:24:50.628 --> 07:24:50.638 align:start position:0%
in your contract
 
07:24:50.638 --> 07:24:53.990 align:start position:0%
in your contract
and

07:24:53.990 --> 07:24:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
07:24:57.190 --> 07:24:57.200 align:start position:0%
and not any of the extra stuff
 
07:24:57.200 --> 07:24:59.750 align:start position:0%
and not any of the extra stuff
and

07:24:59.750 --> 07:24:59.760 align:start position:0%
 
07:24:59.760 --> 07:25:01.750 align:start position:0%
 
there's

07:25:01.750 --> 07:25:01.760 align:start position:0%
there's
 
07:25:04.070 --> 07:25:04.080 align:start position:0%
there's protests that aren't act are
 
07:25:06.548 --> 07:25:06.558 align:start position:0%
technically strikes like for example
 
07:25:06.558 --> 07:25:07.510 align:start position:0%
technically strikes like for example
um

07:25:07.510 --> 07:25:07.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:25:09.110 --> 07:25:09.120 align:start position:0%
a few years back
 
07:25:11.910 --> 07:25:11.920 align:start position:0%
uh when i was in college uh mark market
 
07:25:15.750 --> 07:25:15.760 align:start position:0%
 
07:25:18.868 --> 07:25:18.878 align:start position:0%
they're there for the keeping
 
07:25:22.548 --> 07:25:22.558 align:start position:0%
arthur t demoulas as the chair of
 
07:25:24.468 --> 07:25:24.478 align:start position:0%
market basket that wasn't technically a
 
07:25:26.788 --> 07:25:26.798 align:start position:0%
strike or anything but the workers were
 
07:25:28.788 --> 07:25:28.798 align:start position:0%
still protesting
 
07:25:28.798 --> 07:25:29.910 align:start position:0%
still protesting
and

07:25:29.910 --> 07:25:29.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
07:25:29.920 --> 07:25:31.590 align:start position:0%
and
um

07:25:31.590 --> 07:25:31.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:25:33.670 --> 07:25:33.680 align:start position:0%
fighting for their
 
07:25:33.680 --> 07:25:34.868 align:start position:0%
fighting for their
uh

07:25:34.868 --> 07:25:34.878 align:start position:0%
uh
 
07:25:37.990 --> 07:25:38.000 align:start position:0%
their preferences to be heard in the
 
07:25:39.910 --> 07:25:39.920 align:start position:0%
corporate decision-making process so i
 
07:25:41.430 --> 07:25:41.440 align:start position:0%
think that would count as something
 
07:25:41.440 --> 07:25:42.868 align:start position:0%
think that would count as something
that's

07:25:42.868 --> 07:25:42.878 align:start position:0%
that's
 
07:25:45.430 --> 07:25:45.440 align:start position:0%
a labor action that isn't technically a
 
07:25:45.440 --> 07:25:49.430 align:start position:0%
a labor action that isn't technically a
strike

07:25:49.430 --> 07:25:49.440 align:start position:0%
 
07:25:50.788 --> 07:25:50.798 align:start position:0%
thank you very much representative are
 
07:25:53.750 --> 07:25:53.760 align:start position:0%
there further questions
 
07:25:55.990 --> 07:25:56.000 align:start position:0%
not yes represent moffitt
 
07:25:57.910 --> 07:25:57.920 align:start position:0%
famous chair do you envision this uh
 
07:25:59.990 --> 07:26:00.000 align:start position:0%
word to move forward as being a
 
07:26:02.150 --> 07:26:02.160 align:start position:0%
standalone course or embedded in an
 
07:26:06.628 --> 07:26:06.638 align:start position:0%
existing course i'd see this as being
 
07:26:08.788 --> 07:26:08.798 align:start position:0%
embedded in
 
07:26:11.750 --> 07:26:11.760 align:start position:0%
the existing history curriculum
 
07:26:15.030 --> 07:26:15.040 align:start position:0%
um just to
 
07:26:17.350 --> 07:26:17.360 align:start position:0%
add some
 
07:26:19.750 --> 07:26:19.760 align:start position:0%
add some extra
 
07:26:22.150 --> 07:26:22.160 align:start position:0%
mentions of labor to
 
07:26:27.350 --> 07:26:27.360 align:start position:0%
 
07:26:30.230 --> 07:26:30.240 align:start position:0%
and new hampshire history curriculum
 
07:26:30.240 --> 07:26:32.468 align:start position:0%
and new hampshire history curriculum
um

07:26:32.468 --> 07:26:32.478 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:26:39.590 --> 07:26:39.600 align:start position:0%
 
07:26:41.510 --> 07:26:41.520 align:start position:0%
yeah i think i think that since it says
 
07:26:43.830 --> 07:26:43.840 align:start position:0%
standard history curriculum that means
 
07:26:45.350 --> 07:26:45.360 align:start position:0%
part of the
 
07:26:48.150 --> 07:26:48.160 align:start position:0%
existing course rather than a standalone
 
07:26:50.150 --> 07:26:50.160 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very much further
 
07:26:50.160 --> 07:26:52.150 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very much further

07:26:56.388 --> 07:26:56.398 align:start position:0%

microphone

07:27:02.310 --> 07:27:02.320 align:start position:0%
 
07:27:05.110 --> 07:27:05.120 align:start position:0%
a question that comes to mind to me is a
 
07:27:08.468 --> 07:27:08.478 align:start position:0%
former union president twice over
 
07:27:11.510 --> 07:27:11.520 align:start position:0%
is that if you teach these subjects as
 
07:27:13.670 --> 07:27:13.680 align:start position:0%
history per se
 
07:27:15.910 --> 07:27:15.920 align:start position:0%
you have a way of fixing things in the
 
07:27:15.920 --> 07:27:16.788 align:start position:0%
you have a way of fixing things in the
past

07:27:16.788 --> 07:27:16.798 align:start position:0%
past
 
07:27:19.510 --> 07:27:19.520 align:start position:0%
that may not be existing in the current
 
07:27:22.310 --> 07:27:22.320 align:start position:0%
working conditions and i would
 
07:27:24.948 --> 07:27:24.958 align:start position:0%
suggest that maybe you might want to
 
07:27:28.468 --> 07:27:28.478 align:start position:0%
 
07:27:30.628 --> 07:27:30.638 align:start position:0%
the idea of teaching as
 
07:27:32.628 --> 07:27:32.638 align:start position:0%
something like working conditions or
 
07:27:35.510 --> 07:27:35.520 align:start position:0%
some conditions of work rather than as a
 
07:27:36.868 --> 07:27:36.878 align:start position:0%
history course
 
07:27:39.510 --> 07:27:39.520 align:start position:0%
maybe a better place to look at would be
 
07:27:41.830 --> 07:27:41.840 align:start position:0%
career planning or something like that
 
07:27:44.070 --> 07:27:44.080 align:start position:0%
to include those kinds of things that
 
07:27:45.830 --> 07:27:45.840 align:start position:0%
are contemporary
 
07:27:47.750 --> 07:27:47.760 align:start position:0%
rather than historical because there's
 
07:27:50.230 --> 07:27:50.240 align:start position:0%
been some brutal terrible
 
07:27:52.310 --> 07:27:52.320 align:start position:0%
you know strikes as you know and things
 
07:27:54.788 --> 07:27:54.798 align:start position:0%
like that and i'm not sure that those
 
07:27:57.190 --> 07:27:57.200 align:start position:0%
are likely to happen again as they
 
07:27:58.628 --> 07:27:58.638 align:start position:0%
worked out then
 
07:28:01.270 --> 07:28:01.280 align:start position:0%
but they do point to the vehemence or
 
07:28:03.110 --> 07:28:03.120 align:start position:0%
the or the feeling of
 
07:28:06.150 --> 07:28:06.160 align:start position:0%
voice powerlessness that they felt and
 
07:28:08.628 --> 07:28:08.638 align:start position:0%
they they grew out of that but right now
 
07:28:11.510 --> 07:28:11.520 align:start position:0%
things are transforming dramatically
 
07:28:13.030 --> 07:28:13.040 align:start position:0%
in the workplace
 
07:28:15.270 --> 07:28:15.280 align:start position:0%
and so that what used to be management
 
07:28:17.190 --> 07:28:17.200 align:start position:0%
is now part of
 
07:28:17.200 --> 07:28:18.548 align:start position:0%
is now part of
employment

07:28:18.548 --> 07:28:18.558 align:start position:0%
employment
 
07:28:20.628 --> 07:28:20.638 align:start position:0%
and so the roles are changing and that's
 
07:28:23.350 --> 07:28:23.360 align:start position:0%
what i think might be more useful to
 
07:28:26.468 --> 07:28:26.478 align:start position:0%
contemporary students i ask that in
 
07:28:28.150 --> 07:28:28.160 align:start position:0%
a sense of i think it's an important
 
07:28:30.548 --> 07:28:30.558 align:start position:0%
subject just how do we go about
 
07:28:32.150 --> 07:28:32.160 align:start position:0%
educating people
 
07:28:34.230 --> 07:28:34.240 align:start position:0%
so um you mentioned
 
07:28:37.670 --> 07:28:37.680 align:start position:0%
about how strikes used to be
 
07:28:39.910 --> 07:28:39.920 align:start position:0%
violent in the past and
 
07:28:41.990 --> 07:28:42.000 align:start position:0%
how we know that but the thing is i
 
07:28:43.430 --> 07:28:43.440 align:start position:0%
don't think a lot of students these days
 
07:28:45.350 --> 07:28:45.360 align:start position:0%
do actually know that
 
07:28:45.360 --> 07:28:46.548 align:start position:0%
do actually know that
um

07:28:46.548 --> 07:28:46.558 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:28:46.558 --> 07:28:47.910 align:start position:0%
um
like

07:28:47.910 --> 07:28:47.920 align:start position:0%
like
 
07:28:50.868 --> 07:28:50.878 align:start position:0%
you know i i never i didn't really
 
07:28:52.708 --> 07:28:52.718 align:start position:0%
learn about
 
07:28:56.788 --> 07:28:56.798 align:start position:0%
violence being part of the labor labor
 
07:28:56.798 --> 07:28:57.670 align:start position:0%
violence being part of the labor labor
um

07:28:57.670 --> 07:28:57.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:28:57.680 --> 07:28:58.868 align:start position:0%
um
struggle

07:28:58.868 --> 07:28:58.878 align:start position:0%
struggle
 
07:29:00.948 --> 07:29:00.958 align:start position:0%
until i was in college
 
07:29:00.958 --> 07:29:02.628 align:start position:0%
until i was in college
um

07:29:02.628 --> 07:29:02.638 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:29:05.670 --> 07:29:05.680 align:start position:0%
you know i i
 
07:29:08.310 --> 07:29:08.320 align:start position:0%
i do think that
 
07:29:09.430 --> 07:29:09.440 align:start position:0%
well yes
 
07:29:09.440 --> 07:29:10.310 align:start position:0%
well yes
um

07:29:10.310 --> 07:29:10.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:29:12.868 --> 07:29:12.878 align:start position:0%
these things did happen in the past
 
07:29:12.878 --> 07:29:14.230 align:start position:0%
these things did happen in the past
um

07:29:14.230 --> 07:29:14.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:29:16.310 --> 07:29:16.320 align:start position:0%
the past is connected to the present and
 
07:29:19.590 --> 07:29:19.600 align:start position:0%
a good history teacher ought to be able
 
07:29:22.868 --> 07:29:22.878 align:start position:0%
to help students understand
 
07:29:24.830 --> 07:29:24.840 align:start position:0%
how exactly the past
 
07:29:24.840 --> 07:29:26.548 align:start position:0%
how exactly the past
is

07:29:26.548 --> 07:29:26.558 align:start position:0%
is
 
07:29:28.788 --> 07:29:28.798 align:start position:0%
is connected to the president
 
07:29:31.670 --> 07:29:31.680 align:start position:0%
so um yeah i do think
 
07:29:34.310 --> 07:29:34.320 align:start position:0%
i think it's worth
 
07:29:34.320 --> 07:29:35.350 align:start position:0%
i think it's worth
keeping

07:29:35.350 --> 07:29:35.360 align:start position:0%
keeping
 
07:29:37.990 --> 07:29:38.000 align:start position:0%
um the historical perspective in this
 
07:29:39.510 --> 07:29:39.520 align:start position:0%
bill but i would
 
07:29:42.230 --> 07:29:42.240 align:start position:0%
i wouldn't be interested in
 
07:29:42.240 --> 07:29:43.270 align:start position:0%
i wouldn't be interested in
um

07:29:43.270 --> 07:29:43.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:29:46.548 --> 07:29:46.558 align:start position:0%
working on a bill to do some of those
 
07:29:48.548 --> 07:29:48.558 align:start position:0%
other ideas you had
 
07:29:52.388 --> 07:29:52.398 align:start position:0%
as well with you if you wanted to
 
07:29:56.230 --> 07:29:56.240 align:start position:0%
 
07:29:57.830 --> 07:29:57.840 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
07:29:59.990 --> 07:30:00.000 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
07:30:03.910 --> 07:30:03.920 align:start position:0%
not seen thank you very much thank you
 
07:30:05.910 --> 07:30:05.920 align:start position:0%
with that i don't see i don't have any
 
07:30:07.910 --> 07:30:07.920 align:start position:0%
other pink cards here so i'm going to
 
07:30:11.190 --> 07:30:11.200 align:start position:0%
close this hearing on 11 44.
 
07:30:13.190 --> 07:30:13.200 align:start position:0%
thank you and that concludes our docket
 
07:30:16.230 --> 07:30:16.240 align:start position:0%
 
07:31:59.990 --> 07:32:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
07:32:00.000 --> 07:32:02.080 align:start position:0%
 
you
